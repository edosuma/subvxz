02:01.840 --> 02:04.752
No, man... don't come in the morning,
I won't be here until two...

02:05.360 --> 02:07.940
'Cause that's when the morning's swell
finally flattens out, you dig?

02:10.199 --> 02:14.200
All right... just bring it around the back then.
Cool. Peace.

02:22.800 --> 02:23.869
I'm not normal.

02:24.440 --> 02:25.509
Clearly!

02:25.800 --> 02:26.789
I need a job.

02:30.080 --> 02:31.069
It's yours.

02:31.280 --> 02:34.670
Hang on, Trucker. You said hiring was
a democratic process around here.

02:34.920 --> 02:36.911
Yeah, that's the way I heard it.

02:38.760 --> 02:40.876
Okay... all those in favor of hiring...

02:41.120 --> 02:42.109
Piper.

02:42.250 --> 02:43.629
...Piper, put your hands up.
Thank you, Jen.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.353
Hey, what about an interview?

02:47.680 --> 02:48.908
Oh, that's fine.

02:49.520 --> 02:51.511
Okay, uh... lemme think...

02:52.880 --> 02:54.154
Elvis. Dead or alive?

02:54.480 --> 02:55.434
Dead.

02:55.469 --> 02:56.549
Andy Kauffman?

02:56.920 --> 02:57.874
Dead.

02:57.909 --> 02:58.954
Jerry Garcia?

02:58.989 --> 03:00.308
Grateful. And dead.

03:00.343 --> 03:01.629
Mariah Carey?

03:01.920 --> 03:04.195
Are we talkin' about her acting career, or...?

03:04.680 --> 03:05.634
No.

03:05.669 --> 03:07.443
Okay. Then... alive.

03:07.478 --> 03:09.192
Why did you come to Santa Cruz?

03:10.320 --> 03:11.719
I... have family here.

03:12.640 --> 03:13.629
Are you a virgin?

03:13.840 --> 03:15.034
Mr. Julius!

03:16.200 --> 03:18.156
No. But I used to be.

03:19.520 --> 03:21.033
You're not a witch, by any chance?

03:21.068 --> 03:22.593
Is that a job requirement?

03:23.520 --> 03:26.637
Trucker's blazin' for the woman who owns
the crystal store across the street.

03:27.080 --> 03:28.273
He thinks she's wiccan.

03:28.308 --> 03:31.040
Yeah, they're soulmates, except she's
not exactly aware of it yet.

03:31.280 --> 03:33.157
Okay everybody, time to vote.

03:58.640 --> 03:59.993
Okay, time for a lil' homework.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.995
Then can we go to the craft store?

04:11.640 --> 04:12.993
Everybody relax!

04:19.839 --> 04:20.793
I'm here.

04:20.829 --> 04:23.777
Oh, and so close to almost on time.

04:24.335 --> 04:27.720
C'mon, once I start showing up on time,
you'll expect it every day.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.034
He works here?

04:30.680 --> 04:32.318
Well... he's employed here.

04:35.120 --> 04:36.189
What's up?

04:38.560 --> 04:39.674
Don't pay attention to him.

04:39.709 --> 04:44.078
Okay, today's topic of conversation: clueless men
and the women who use them for gratification.

04:51.400 --> 04:52.389
Who are you?

04:53.400 --> 04:54.354
Piper.

04:54.389 --> 04:55.794
Piper... what are you doing here, Piper?

04:56.080 --> 04:57.479
I work here.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.791
Why wasn't I notified?
I wasn't notified!

05:00.826 --> 05:03.235
Hey, Priestly! We hired someone.

05:03.270 --> 05:04.480
Thank you.

05:04.515 --> 05:07.319
I swear, we need like a bulletin board or
staff e-mail or somethin'...

05:08.560 --> 05:11.279
You know, Priestly?
Piper thinks Elvis is dead.

05:11.960 --> 05:13.075
Really?

05:13.280 --> 05:14.952
And now you hire people who fail the interview?

05:16.360 --> 05:17.475
C'mon, man!

05:18.280 --> 05:21.158
I don't know. I mean, you're cute and everything, but...

05:21.440 --> 05:23.192
But what? C'mon, Tish.

05:23.440 --> 05:25.431
- It's just...
- Here it comes!

05:28.080 --> 05:29.877
- I don't really like sex.
- What?!

05:31.080 --> 05:33.036
- How can you not like-
- I've never had a...

05:35.040 --> 05:36.456
you know...

05:36.491 --> 05:37.872
Woah! Never?

05:40.040 --> 05:41.996
Well, obviously you haven't been with the right guy.

05:46.240 --> 05:48.231
My God, does that really work?

05:48.560 --> 05:49.993
Every time.

05:50.200 --> 05:52.111
Are you kiddin' me? It's men's greatest challenge.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.118
Tish is the scorpion queen.

05:54.600 --> 05:55.953
See ya tonight!

06:01.440 --> 06:02.429
Damn!

06:04.520 --> 06:06.750
Well? Another comrade used and discarded. Huh, Tish?

06:08.320 --> 06:09.884
You know, I gotta be honest with you, Tish...

06:09.919 --> 06:12.209
I've never been really comfortable
watching you do that to men.

06:12.244 --> 06:14.500
I mean there should be some sort of...
like... warning sign posted.

06:14.640 --> 06:16.517
If men are that easy to manipulate,

06:16.720 --> 06:18.472
they deserve to be taken advantage of.

06:19.240 --> 06:21.879
I'm easy to manipulate.
Why don't women take advantage of me?

06:24.280 --> 06:26.271
I think we can all guess the answer to that.

06:47.600 --> 06:48.874
Is that the crystal lady?

06:49.160 --> 06:50.309
Oh yeah, that's Zo.

06:50.680 --> 06:51.669
Zo?

06:51.960 --> 06:53.518
Yeah, it's short for Zoheret.

06:53.960 --> 06:55.712
It means "she shines" in hebrew.

06:59.640 --> 07:01.319
You see? She knows things.

07:01.354 --> 07:02.998
She seems nice, Trucker.

07:57.840 --> 07:59.910
So, I... 'll give you a call later?

08:00.520 --> 08:01.748
Yeah, uhm... sure.

08:15.040 --> 08:16.712
Oh, look! She can still walk.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.991
All right, let's hear it. What were his grades?

08:22.600 --> 08:25.160
"A" for effort, "C" for execution.

08:26.120 --> 08:27.348
Natural gift?

08:28.560 --> 08:30.039
Didn't even register.

08:30.480 --> 08:31.560
That bad, huh?

08:31.595 --> 08:33.836
That bad, and... he knows it.

08:35.520 --> 08:37.397
Well, did you at least tell him that size doesn't matter?

08:37.679 --> 08:39.078
Yeah, sure, I told him.

08:39.113 --> 08:41.111
You don't actually think guys believe that, do you?

08:47.120 --> 08:48.519
Hey Piper, what's in the case?

08:49.880 --> 08:51.598
Oh... this is my art stuff.

08:52.080 --> 08:53.114
Are you an artist?

08:53.149 --> 08:55.748
Oh, that's cool! Do you paint, like, controversial shit?

08:56.300 --> 08:58.399
Like, people pissing on the Pope or something?

08:58.440 --> 09:00.596
- Oh!
- That's not even controversial anymore.

09:00.840 --> 09:02.114
Well then, what the hell is it?

09:02.520 --> 09:05.990
Well, that's like that, you know...
"politically correct controversialism".

09:06.200 --> 09:08.315
People have done it so often they expect it. Now...

09:08.350 --> 09:10.750
paint someone pissing on Martin Luther King
and see what happens...

09:10.785 --> 09:12.711
Or... Martin Luther King pissing on the Pope!

09:12.746 --> 09:14.239
That's controversial.

09:14.600 --> 09:16.591
Yeah... or, the Pope pissing on Martin Luther King?

09:16.940 --> 09:17.994
Or Martin Lawrence? 'Cause that would be really-

09:18.029 --> 09:22.153
Okay, guys? Guys! I don't paint anyone
pissing on anyone. Sorry.

09:22.480 --> 09:27.000
Yeah, no... it was just an idea, you know. I'm just saying,
if I was an artist I would definetely be pissing on somebody.

09:28.600 --> 09:29.749
Hey, Trucker!

09:32.320 --> 09:34.730
Right! Piper, why don't you decorate our wall for us?

09:37.360 --> 09:38.713
- Really?
- Sure.

09:40.760 --> 09:42.159
Well... what should I paint?

09:43.160 --> 09:45.151
It's yours. Go for it!

09:45.360 --> 09:47.999
You don't have to paint anyone pissing on anyone.

09:48.640 --> 09:50.551
- I... I mean, unless you want to.
- Good morning.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.911
This was in my mail by mistake.

10:03.440 --> 10:05.795
Hi Piper, nice to meet you.

10:06.920 --> 10:07.909
Hi.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.650
Wait wait wait wait... how...
how did you know her name?

10:10.840 --> 10:12.637
She just feels like "Piper".

10:17.000 --> 10:18.991
Zo, before you leave, can I make you a sandwich?

10:19.680 --> 10:20.908
The roast turkey is really good.

10:21.160 --> 10:23.230
Thank you, but I don't eat anyhting that had a mother.

10:23.560 --> 10:24.709
Oh! Okay, uhm...

10:25.960 --> 10:27.234
Egg salad then?

10:27.720 --> 10:30.757
Well... eggs are really a chicken abortion, aren't they?

10:30.792 --> 10:33.678
I mean, I support a woman's right to choose,

10:33.713 --> 10:36.513
...but I don't believe anyone asked the chickens beforehand.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.119
Right on!

10:38.760 --> 10:41.399
Well, actually... since farmers don't keep roosters...

10:41.434 --> 10:42.964
the eggs aren't fertilized, so...

10:42.999 --> 10:46.599
technically you're just eating a by-product
of the hen's menstrual cycle.

10:46.634 --> 10:50.199
Well, that's certainly appetizing!
A hen period salad. That's... lovely.

10:52.720 --> 10:55.473
I think I'll just stick to the 6-inch tofurkey.

10:55.508 --> 10:57.152
- 6-inch tofurkey.
- Coming up!

11:00.560 --> 11:01.709
Hmm... what's this?

11:02.640 --> 11:05.881
Oh, I made a website for Trucker.
And there's an online order form...

11:05.916 --> 11:08.874
so that people just e-mail me their orders
and then we have them ready at their backup time.

11:08.909 --> 11:09.989
That's cool!

11:10.440 --> 11:12.192
Yeah, and this way Jen's online in case
Fuzzy checks in, right?

11:13.160 --> 11:14.479
Who's Fuzzy?

11:14.960 --> 11:17.349
He's just an online friend.
A guy.

11:17.960 --> 11:19.712
Oh, I... hope he's a guy.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.389
We agreed not to exchange any identifying information.

11:23.360 --> 11:25.351
So, basically he could be Charles Manson with a laptop.

11:25.560 --> 11:26.675
Bingo!

11:27.160 --> 11:31.551
No, Fuzzy is good.
His presence feels peaceful, don't you sense it?

11:32.800 --> 11:34.358
Yeah, I sense something.

11:36.160 --> 11:37.639
What? Maybe I do.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.030
Just follow where your soul leads, Jen.

11:44.360 --> 11:45.349
Thank you.

11:45.840 --> 11:46.909
Bye, Trucker.

11:53.200 --> 11:54.349
Bye.

11:57.840 --> 11:59.353
Did I say anything stupid?

12:02.120 --> 12:05.078
Doesn't it worry you?
I mean, you don't know anything about him...

12:05.360 --> 12:07.715
or her... or even it!

12:08.440 --> 12:10.510
You know, he's just somebody I can talk to.

12:12.080 --> 12:15.072
And I know it's crazy, but... I feel really close to him.

12:16.480 --> 12:17.879
Do you think he's your soulmate?

12:18.640 --> 12:19.834
Would that be so bad?

12:19.869 --> 12:20.949
No, but...

12:22.360 --> 12:24.396
...what happens when "it" wants to meet?

12:26.840 --> 12:28.910
Well, we've been e-mailing for almost a year,
and it hasn't come up.

12:28.945 --> 12:30.034
A year?!

12:30.069 --> 12:32.919
Jen, what do you guys talk about if
you don't talk about each other?

12:33.520 --> 12:34.873
Everything else?

12:35.920 --> 12:38.878
I mean, we talk about music, and books,
the war in Iraq...

12:39.320 --> 12:40.799
his dog, my cat...

12:41.760 --> 12:44.838
You know, I just told him that I started working
with a future famous artist.

12:46.360 --> 12:47.873
Well, let's not get carried away.

12:50.760 --> 12:54.192
God, it must be such a trip to look at the ocean
and know you can draw it.

12:55.960 --> 12:57.473
Are your parents artistic?

12:57.720 --> 12:59.278
Yeah, my mom's really good.

12:59.480 --> 13:01.357
So maybe you'll have a super-talented kid one day.

13:07.520 --> 13:08.635
I already do.

13:11.800 --> 13:13.028
I was 15.

13:13.920 --> 13:16.593
I had... four younger brothers.

13:17.280 --> 13:19.077
God, one of them was still in diapers.

13:19.120 --> 13:21.431
There was no way my mom was gonna let me keep her.

13:22.440 --> 13:26.558
Never met the couple, but...
I spoke to the wife on the phone once.

13:27.320 --> 13:29.356
She said their names were Lisa and Noah, and...

13:30.520 --> 13:32.636
that they wanted to name her Julia.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.356
She asked if that was okay with me.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.430
I thought that was really considerate, you know?

13:45.080 --> 13:46.957
She promised to stay in touch,

13:46.992 --> 13:48.718
to send pictures...

13:48.920 --> 13:50.364
That's nice.

13:50.399 --> 13:53.154
And she did, for about two years.

13:54.760 --> 13:56.273
Then it just stopped.

13:57.640 --> 14:00.393
The last pictures I saw were of
Julia's second birthday.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.518
Just like that?

14:03.600 --> 14:06.160
Nothing for... six years...

14:09.720 --> 14:11.119
Then I saw this!

14:12.800 --> 14:14.950
I was reading this article about gifted kids...

14:15.400 --> 14:17.994
In the back they have some pictures of
the art students of Santa Cruz. Look!

14:18.440 --> 14:19.873
There she is.

14:20.440 --> 14:25.150
Okay, I mean... she kinda looks like you and...
she's the right age, but-

14:25.560 --> 14:27.994
Jen, I'm not whacked.
Okay, look, they list her name.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.476
- Julia! Julia Miller! And, she's artistic.
- Yeah, but-

14:31.511 --> 14:34.718
So I got on the Net and I looked up
Millers in Santa Cruz...

14:34.753 --> 14:38.236
and there was a million of them, but
there was only one under the name "Noah".

14:38.640 --> 14:40.084
That was the husband's name.

14:40.119 --> 14:42.913
So, I waited until the middle of the day,
and I called the number...

14:42.948 --> 14:45.753
and I got the voice mail, and... they were on it.

14:46.880 --> 14:49.030
"This is Noah... and Julia."

14:49.320 --> 14:50.548
Like that.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.353
Jen, it's them.

14:55.080 --> 14:56.559
What are you gonna do?

14:58.400 --> 14:59.799
I don't know.

15:00.760 --> 15:03.194
Some days it's enough to know
she's happy and healthy and...

15:05.040 --> 15:06.632
other days...

15:19.080 --> 15:21.435
So... what kind of tricks do you have in mind?

15:21.800 --> 15:24.792
Well, you'll see tonight.
I guarantee you won't be disappointed.

15:26.040 --> 15:29.112
Woodstock, you know, it was just beautiful.
It was perfect, you know?

15:29.480 --> 15:32.734
It was all about peace, and free love, and music-

15:32.769 --> 15:35.988
And draft orgy. Drugs. Irresponsibility. Freak!

15:36.300 --> 15:39.790
Oh, mister J... don't be a buzzkiller!
Just focus on the love, huh?

15:53.440 --> 15:54.429
Hi.

16:02.480 --> 16:03.629
It's beautiful.

16:04.520 --> 16:05.669
Thank you.

16:06.160 --> 16:07.673
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

16:25.680 --> 16:28.513
Oh... no. Thank you for the rock.

16:41.240 --> 16:45.472
Oh no, don't even think about it.
My karma needs all the help it can get.

16:46.240 --> 16:47.912
Thank you, Trucker.

16:49.720 --> 16:52.280
Okay, so anyway, they do you wrong about the drugs...

16:52.315 --> 16:53.923
And I wish I was alive back then!

16:53.958 --> 16:56.577
I mean, it's just my luck to hit my sexual peak
during a time when...

16:56.612 --> 16:59.197
when celibacy is cool, and...
the only safe sex is watching porn.

16:59.232 --> 17:01.845
I should've peaked 40 years ago!

17:01.880 --> 17:03.234
What difference would that have made?

17:03.300 --> 17:06.794
I mean, you still wouldn't get laid,
and you'd still be watching porn.

17:06.829 --> 17:08.996
The only difference would be,
you'd be wearing more polyester.

17:09.400 --> 17:10.958
She does have a point, Priestly.

17:11.200 --> 17:12.872
But, at least here you have company.

17:13.160 --> 17:15.276
No one's getting much, except for... Tish.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.720
- I'm excited about tonight. Oh, what time?
- Eight thirty.

17:20.440 --> 17:21.429
- Bye.
- Bye.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.478
Oh, don't even start with me!

17:29.513 --> 17:31.989
If men are that easy to out finesse,
they deserve what they get.

17:32.024 --> 17:33.599
Hey, I'm easy! Don't I deserve it?

17:34.640 --> 17:37.154
Well, Priestly, see, your problem is
you always go after the hot chicks.

17:37.440 --> 17:39.476
You know, you just gotta raise your expectations, man!

17:39.511 --> 17:40.554
Excuse me?

17:40.589 --> 17:43.877
Well, really good looking women, they're high maintainance.
And without exception...

17:44.120 --> 17:46.190
completely worthless between the sheets.

17:46.225 --> 17:47.427
Seriously?

17:47.462 --> 17:48.594
God's truth.

17:48.629 --> 17:50.392
Certainly been my experience.

17:50.640 --> 17:52.153
Oh, pff... you guys are pathetic.

17:52.840 --> 17:54.239
- All right. Take Tish, for example.
- Right?

17:54.840 --> 17:57.149
Men are so pumped to be with a body like hers,

17:57.480 --> 17:59.948
that all she's gotta do is just lay back
and enjoy the ride, you see?

18:00.320 --> 18:02.550
That way she's never gonna develop any skills in bed.

18:02.585 --> 18:03.909
I second that!

18:03.944 --> 18:05.199
Hey, I work hard!

18:05.234 --> 18:08.073
Hey, don't get me wrong!
Attractive women are great to look at, just...

18:08.108 --> 18:09.803
don't go home with the prom queen.

18:09.838 --> 18:13.117
- Give her the crown, she'll never go down.
- I was the prom queen.

18:13.520 --> 18:14.714
Well, I rest my case.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.195
All right, that's it!
You. And me. In the office.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.038
I'll show you how I earned my crown.

18:21.040 --> 18:22.109
Women!

18:23.400 --> 18:25.152
They are so easy to out finesse.

18:26.960 --> 18:28.188
They deserve what they get!

18:28.800 --> 18:29.789
Dicks!

18:34.600 --> 18:35.928
Nice! Nice!
Shit!

20:41.440 --> 20:42.589
Thank you.

20:43.360 --> 20:45.635
Well, that was a near death experience.
Thanks.

20:46.360 --> 20:47.475
No problem.

20:47.920 --> 20:50.639
Wow! You draw really good rocks!
They're better than mine.

20:51.920 --> 20:52.955
Wanna know why?

20:52.990 --> 20:54.069
Sure.

20:54.520 --> 20:55.589
I can show you.

20:57.440 --> 20:59.237
You just gotta deepen your shadows, see?

21:02.560 --> 21:03.993
- Don't be afraid to be bold.
- Wow!

21:07.520 --> 21:08.474
Thanks!

21:08.509 --> 21:09.953
That's a... nice subject.

21:10.880 --> 21:13.030
Oh... well, I hope you don't mind.
I'm not a perv or anyhting...

21:13.065 --> 21:14.918
I just had to practice drawing children.

21:15.120 --> 21:16.758
Doesn't look like you need much practice.

21:20.160 --> 21:21.229
You want it?

21:21.264 --> 21:22.469
No.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.119
Not really.

21:27.320 --> 21:28.435
I'm kiddin'!

21:28.880 --> 21:30.996
I'm kiddin', I'd love it.
If you don't mind parting with it, of course...

21:31.840 --> 21:33.353
- What's her name?
- Julia.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.872
She is another artist.
You know, sometimes I feel like...

21:37.120 --> 21:39.395
the only person left in the universe
who still paints by numbers.

21:39.800 --> 21:42.473
Oh, she must get all her artistic talents
from her mother, then.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.159
Yeah, who knows?

21:49.920 --> 21:51.797
Thank you very much. It's beautiful.

21:52.640 --> 21:53.959
She's beautiful.

21:55.320 --> 21:58.995
Yeah, I'm... sorta partial to it, a little bit.

22:02.120 --> 22:03.314
My name is Noah, by the way.

22:04.560 --> 22:06.312
I'm... Anna.

22:06.560 --> 22:08.278
Anna, pleasure to meet you.

22:08.720 --> 22:11.996
Especially since we've established
that you are not a perv.

22:13.680 --> 22:14.669
Take care!

22:14.920 --> 22:16.069
Bye.

22:35.680 --> 22:37.033
Hey, what's wrong with the Cosmobile?

22:37.360 --> 22:38.554
Uh, it won't start.

22:39.240 --> 22:41.196
Can you hop in and see if we can get it to go?

22:46.320 --> 22:47.435
Ok, try!

22:50.960 --> 22:51.949
I got nothing.

22:53.480 --> 22:54.708
Okay, once more.

22:57.920 --> 22:58.909
Cut it out, cut it out!

23:00.360 --> 23:01.554
All right, go again.

23:21.120 --> 23:22.758
- That was weird, right?
- That was weird. - Weird.

23:26.920 --> 23:27.909
Apron!

23:32.920 --> 23:35.036
Oh, look! Fuzzy22, right on time.

23:35.800 --> 23:36.789
Shut up!

23:37.040 --> 23:38.951
Ha ha! Can't believe it, Jen. You've fallen for a cop.

23:38.986 --> 23:40.234
Why do you think he's a cop?

23:40.269 --> 23:41.799
Er, "fuzz"... what else could it be?

23:41.834 --> 23:43.523
I'm thinking "peach fuzz"...

23:43.558 --> 23:45.233
since he's probably, like, 12 or something.

23:45.268 --> 23:46.759
Or maybe he's got a really hairy back.

23:47.480 --> 23:49.318
Maybe he's a peach farmer in Georgia.

23:49.353 --> 23:51.156
Oh, Jen! You don't wanna move to Georgia.

23:51.191 --> 23:52.598
I'm not moving anywhere.

23:52.633 --> 23:54.279
I bet the "22" means he's a gun freak.

23:54.560 --> 23:55.595
Could... just be his age, you know.

23:55.920 --> 23:57.911
Or... could be the number of years
left until his parole hearing.

23:58.160 --> 24:01.038
Yeah, or maybe the last 22 years
have been really f.. fuzzy for him.

24:01.280 --> 24:02.679
I like that one.

24:27.120 --> 24:28.279
What can I do for you two?

24:28.314 --> 24:30.670
We phoned it in. Two "spicy italian" subs.

24:32.560 --> 24:33.629
How big?

24:34.680 --> 24:36.238
Ten inches...

24:37.320 --> 24:38.389
Total?

24:39.720 --> 24:41.073
Each, of course.

24:51.360 --> 24:52.395
I'm Tish.

25:05.120 --> 25:06.394
Oh my God!

25:12.000 --> 25:13.718
Did that work for anybody else?

25:32.200 --> 25:33.235
Excuse me?

25:33.680 --> 25:34.669
No, not you! Just...

25:36.240 --> 25:37.514
Hello, excuse me!

25:38.200 --> 25:39.394
Hello!

25:40.680 --> 25:41.999
Oh, I'm sorry, I...

25:42.280 --> 25:43.759
"Oh, I'm sorry"... yeah...

25:44.280 --> 25:50.435
I ordered a 12-inch veggie sub.
Does this look like... uh... 12 inches to you?

25:51.080 --> 25:51.830
No, I...

25:54.080 --> 25:56.955
You know how girls are not good with measurements.

25:56.990 --> 25:59.830
My last boyfriend told me that this WAS 12 inches.

25:59.865 --> 26:01.399
So, go figure!

26:02.600 --> 26:03.715
Well...

26:04.800 --> 26:06.119
Thanks.

26:09.520 --> 26:10.839
Thank you very much. Thanks.

26:16.520 --> 26:17.555
Thank you!

26:20.700 --> 26:23.709
All righty... ok... great!
Thank you. I'm such an idiot!

26:25.640 --> 26:26.914
All right, Jen, what's up?

26:27.400 --> 26:28.628
You never strop an order.

26:28.700 --> 26:30.711
Yeah, what happened?
Fuzzy's mother finally take his computer away?

26:30.920 --> 26:33.229
No, actually, he wants to meet.

26:34.400 --> 26:36.311
Don't do it, Jen. You don't know anything about him.

26:36.920 --> 26:40.300
Wait a second. Why does this freak YOU out so bad?
I mean, you go home with anybody who gives you lip service!

26:41.600 --> 26:43.591
I talk to them first, dork!

26:43.800 --> 26:45.711
Besides, I can take care of myself.

26:45.960 --> 26:47.518
This is Jen we're talking about.

26:47.720 --> 26:50.439
Ok, reality check, guys!
I mean, this guy could live in Madagascar.

26:50.640 --> 26:52.392
Yeah! Or... Schenectady.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.078
He lives down near L.A.
He told me.

26:55.113 --> 26:57.157
Did you tell him you were in Santa Cruz?

26:57.720 --> 27:00.314
Jesus, Jen!
Tell me you didn't tell him your real name!

27:00.720 --> 27:02.597
No, he only knows me as "Ladybugger".

27:03.560 --> 27:05.039
So what now, Ladybugger?

27:08.400 --> 27:10.038
I'm gonna think about it.

27:20.280 --> 27:21.713
Tish, right?

27:22.240 --> 27:23.673
Mystery Man, right?

27:24.680 --> 27:25.669
Tadd.

27:26.120 --> 27:27.155
Tadd.

27:27.640 --> 27:29.949
Another "spicy italian" sub, Tadd?

27:30.760 --> 27:31.954
Just one?

27:33.480 --> 27:34.833
One for Brad too.

27:45.360 --> 27:46.509
Nice hair.

27:47.640 --> 27:48.868
Thanks, "Taddly".

27:51.360 --> 27:52.759
Well, see you around, Tish.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.479
Tadd & Brad.

28:07.080 --> 28:08.991
Well, isn't that... gay?

28:23.880 --> 28:25.154
Guess who!

28:25.360 --> 28:26.554
Oh... I don't know!

28:27.240 --> 28:28.559
Remember me?

28:28.800 --> 28:30.518
Of course, I remember you.

28:30.720 --> 28:32.392
Daddy, look who I found!

28:32.720 --> 28:36.633
Hey there! It's Anna who draws rocks and little girls.

28:37.880 --> 28:38.949
What are you doing here?

28:38.984 --> 28:40.086
Homework.

28:40.121 --> 28:41.154
Me too.

28:41.189 --> 28:42.950
I've to do Math and science...

28:42.985 --> 28:44.711
before I'm allowed to do any art.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.831
Yeah, some mean ogre made up that rule.

28:47.240 --> 28:49.390
Okay, Julia, I'm gonna look up those articles.

28:49.425 --> 28:50.595
Okay.

28:51.480 --> 28:52.913
I'll be fine with Anna.

28:53.440 --> 28:54.589
I'll be right back.

29:32.680 --> 29:33.874
I'll show you something.

29:34.120 --> 29:35.359
See the ears?

29:35.394 --> 29:37.357
Just put a little shadow in there.

29:37.600 --> 29:38.715
Cool!

29:43.560 --> 29:45.152
That doesn't look like Math to me.

29:45.680 --> 29:46.634
Done.

29:46.669 --> 29:48.199
- Spelling?
- Done.

29:49.200 --> 29:50.599
Well, I have to check it.

29:50.840 --> 29:51.989
Done.

29:52.640 --> 29:55.757
Dad, did you know Anna has
four little brothers?

29:55.792 --> 29:57.070
She knows all about kids.

29:57.105 --> 29:58.314
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

29:58.349 --> 30:01.114
And she works in a sandwich shop,
but not full time.

30:01.320 --> 30:02.469
Oh yeah?

30:04.520 --> 30:05.714
Dad!

30:08.720 --> 30:10.039
Am I missing something?

30:10.560 --> 30:12.915
Julia has been asking me about private art lessons...

30:12.950 --> 30:15.270
...and I believe she thinks she's found her tutor.

30:16.680 --> 30:17.794
Well...

30:17.829 --> 30:21.515
And you could pick me up at school,
so I won't have to walk home with Bradley...

30:22.560 --> 30:23.549
Who?

30:24.000 --> 30:25.479
Okay, two times a week I teach
an adult education class...

30:26.560 --> 30:29.154
and poor Julia has to walk home with Bradley.

30:29.600 --> 30:33.513
And then she's forced to stay with him
for 45 whole minutes until I get there.

30:35.040 --> 30:36.314
You are a terrible father.

30:36.840 --> 30:38.876
Huh, I gotta give her something
to tell her therapist in ten years.

30:38.911 --> 30:40.632
Bradley picks his nose in class...

30:40.880 --> 30:43.553
and makes these fart noises in his armpits.

30:44.160 --> 30:46.276
Testosterone poisoning, actually you can't help it.

30:47.200 --> 30:48.792
Anna, please, save me.

30:49.040 --> 30:50.473
Please!

31:00.680 --> 31:01.669
Okay.

31:02.600 --> 31:04.079
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

31:31.200 --> 31:32.297
Tadd.

31:32.332 --> 31:33.395
Tish.

31:33.760 --> 31:35.352
So, what can I get for you tonight?

31:37.200 --> 31:38.553
An order to go.

31:39.320 --> 31:40.594
What do you want?

31:41.920 --> 31:43.194
You.

31:48.320 --> 31:50.959
Sorry, just living vicariously. Ignore me.

31:56.240 --> 31:57.389
Well, look...

31:58.720 --> 32:01.598
With men... I've never had a...

32:02.200 --> 32:04.077
you know... a full on...

32:04.840 --> 32:06.398
Does that work on stupid guys?

32:07.320 --> 32:08.878
Yeah, usually.

32:10.040 --> 32:11.439
You're ready to go then?

32:22.040 --> 32:24.076
Huh! It's nice how he holds the door for her.

32:24.640 --> 32:25.959
What a gentleman...

32:26.160 --> 32:27.639
He's a giver, I can tell.

32:28.480 --> 32:29.833
...and I'm the only keeper.

32:41.360 --> 32:42.634
Car's really nice.

32:43.040 --> 32:44.439
Yeah, I love this car.

32:45.360 --> 32:46.873
I love the way you look in this car.

32:48.520 --> 32:49.635
Where is Brad tonight?

32:49.840 --> 32:52.308
Sitting in the apartment,
wishing he was taking you out instead.

32:55.200 --> 32:58.317
So how do you afford such a nice car...
and expensive tips?

32:59.960 --> 33:01.632
Sucked out of my loaded father.

33:32.800 --> 33:33.789
What?

33:34.000 --> 33:35.592
Nothing, it's really good.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.230
Nah, that sucky thing is not right.

33:40.240 --> 33:41.468
That "sucky thing"?

33:41.680 --> 33:43.318
That's what my dad calls it.

33:43.640 --> 33:45.198
What your dad calls what?

33:45.640 --> 33:46.993
This.

33:47.640 --> 33:49.596
What? The... sucky thing?

33:50.320 --> 33:52.151
Otherwise known as a turkey baste.

33:52.680 --> 33:57.117
Well... yeah, if you wanna use its nickname...
but everybody knows the real name is of course the...

33:57.520 --> 33:58.873
The sucky thing.

33:59.680 --> 34:03.479
Speaking of sucky things,
I have a meeting at six o'clock on Thursday.

34:03.514 --> 34:06.592
Do you think you'd be able to stay late with Julia.
Maybe... get her some dinner?

34:07.600 --> 34:09.318
Would I get to cook with the sucky thing?

34:09.520 --> 34:11.078
Absolutely!

34:11.320 --> 34:12.799
Then it's a deal.

34:22.600 --> 34:23.634
So, where's the mother?

34:23.668 --> 34:25.273
- I don't know.
- You didn't ask?

34:25.719 --> 34:26.708
No!

34:26.920 --> 34:29.309
I mean, as far as they're concerned
I'm just some college student.

34:29.679 --> 34:31.318
It would be... weird, if I asked.

34:31.639 --> 34:32.993
What if she calls or...
comes over when you're there?

34:33.600 --> 34:36.353
Then you dope slap the bitch
for dissing you for five years.

34:39.159 --> 34:40.513
Oh, look! It lives.

34:40.719 --> 34:41.947
Barely.

34:43.960 --> 34:46.428
All right, start with this.
I'll get the IV drip set up.

34:46.800 --> 34:47.914
I'm in love.

34:47.949 --> 34:49.120
No, you're in heat...

34:49.155 --> 34:52.232
Oh, look! A man pretending
to acknowledge the difference.

34:53.080 --> 34:54.638
Finally found an 11, huh?

34:55.560 --> 34:56.788
Oh... 12!

34:57.120 --> 34:59.418
I did things with Tadd,
I've never done before.

34:59.453 --> 35:01.716
Oh, really? Like what?
Wait for the second date?

35:02.000 --> 35:05.312
Well, the surf sucked.
What did I miss at our staff meeting?

35:05.347 --> 35:08.169
Well, Tish is in love.
Or lust...

35:08.204 --> 35:10.992
...depending on who you're talking to.

35:11.027 --> 35:13.151
Really? Proud of you, angel.

35:13.840 --> 35:17.161
Piper is digging herself deeper and deeper
into the pit of deceit with the Millers...

35:17.196 --> 35:20.796
Good... nice to see that our old company tradition
for making the worst possible decision...

35:20.831 --> 35:24.839
in any situation, has been passed on
to the next generation of employee.

35:25.320 --> 35:27.515
Priestly has gotten in touch with his feminine side.

35:27.550 --> 35:29.079
I love my kilt!

35:29.440 --> 35:33.115
And I have reached a decision... on meeting Fuzzy.

35:36.040 --> 35:37.029
And?

35:38.160 --> 35:39.388
Well, hmm...

35:39.840 --> 35:41.443
We have all the same interests,

35:41.478 --> 35:43.278
he makes me laugh all the time, and...

35:44.160 --> 35:45.673
I tell him everything.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.275
It's a no-brainer. We have to meet!

35:48.310 --> 35:49.394
Right on!

35:49.429 --> 35:50.919
And... what if "he" is a woman?

35:51.120 --> 35:52.348
We'll find a way to make it work.

35:52.560 --> 35:54.039
Ooh, if that happens, can I watch?

35:54.074 --> 35:55.235
What if he's 14?

35:55.440 --> 35:57.556
Oooh, if that happens, can I... videotape?

35:58.080 --> 36:00.958
He's driving himself to the meeting point,
so he's gotta be at least 16, right?

36:02.200 --> 36:05.078
And that's not... that much younger.

36:05.520 --> 36:06.839
Convicted felon?

36:07.200 --> 36:09.156
Hm, he's out now, so it couldn't have been that bad.

36:09.191 --> 36:10.234
Paralyzed?

36:10.269 --> 36:12.396
If he can go with that, I sure can.

36:12.600 --> 36:14.476
Ugly as a rhino's ass?

36:14.511 --> 36:18.116
Looks are really the least of my worries.
I mean, he's a great guy.

36:18.840 --> 36:24.356
But what if he's got, like, crazy ass hair and...
and more artificial holes in his head than real ones?

36:24.760 --> 36:26.398
Oh, I could never be that lucky.

36:27.720 --> 36:29.960
Okay, so... when and where?

36:29.995 --> 36:32.720
Halfway, next Saturday, at a club in Morro Bay.

36:33.120 --> 36:34.951
He'll be the one with the white rose on his table.

36:35.240 --> 36:37.231
Oh, that's so romantic.

36:38.800 --> 36:40.153
Trucker...

36:40.360 --> 36:43.557
I was wondering if there was any way
I could borrow the cosmobile...

36:43.800 --> 36:45.438
I think that way I could just camp out.

36:45.640 --> 36:47.915
- Of course. Anything for true love!
- Thank you.

36:48.760 --> 36:49.988
Well, I'm going with.

36:50.520 --> 36:51.594
Really?

36:51.629 --> 36:52.669
Me too.

36:52.920 --> 36:54.114
You guys are the best.

36:54.149 --> 36:55.309
Yeah, count me in!

36:55.600 --> 36:56.999
FORGET IT!

36:57.320 --> 36:58.719
Can we get to work now?

36:59.200 --> 37:00.315
I... I'll drive.

37:00.350 --> 37:01.434
No!

37:01.469 --> 37:02.629
I'll buy the beer.

37:06.560 --> 37:08.357
Never get to do anything fun...

37:10.040 --> 37:12.429
Priestly, you wanna go out on a fly errand?

37:12.464 --> 37:13.509
Affirmative!

37:13.840 --> 37:14.840
But what's that we need, captain?

37:14.875 --> 37:16.758
Oh, we're out of tampons in the ladies' bathroom.

37:19.240 --> 37:20.514
Oh, look at that face!

37:21.360 --> 37:22.873
Don't worry about it, we'll get 'em tomorrow.

37:23.080 --> 37:24.832
What, do you think I'm afraid of a box of plungers?

37:26.040 --> 37:27.155
No worries, mate.

37:28.160 --> 37:29.479
Come on, look at me!

37:30.920 --> 37:32.638
I'm a poster boy for maturity.

37:33.680 --> 37:36.035
All right, maybe not, but close enough.

37:36.280 --> 37:37.473
I can do this.

37:37.508 --> 37:40.672
All right? I'm comfortable enough with myself
to do this for you ladies.

37:41.200 --> 37:42.474
Hey, Renaissance Man!

37:43.480 --> 37:45.630
If you need help, just call me.

38:13.760 --> 38:15.193
Beach City Grill. Subs by the inch.

38:15.680 --> 38:17.318
Code blue. Hostile territory. Aborting mission.

38:17.353 --> 38:18.429
Who is this?

38:18.680 --> 38:20.376
It's your Renaissance Man. I'm at the store.

38:20.411 --> 38:22.403
There's too many enemy tampons. I'm bailing.

38:22.438 --> 38:24.395
All right, stay focused. Describe the situation.

38:24.640 --> 38:26.596
Initial recon appears to be bag or box?

38:26.631 --> 38:28.204
- Box.
- Box. Roger that.

38:28.239 --> 38:31.432
- All right, look around chest height. Do you see anything marked "regular"?
- Okay, regular...

38:34.520 --> 38:36.750
Well, here's one but it says "slender regular".

38:37.640 --> 38:40.552
How can something be both slender and regular?
Isn't that mutually exclusive?

38:40.587 --> 38:41.594
Priestly...

38:41.629 --> 38:44.678
Unless, of course they're implying that in the
mysterious underworld of Femboxes slender is regular.

38:44.713 --> 38:45.834
Priestly. Are you done?

38:45.869 --> 38:47.444
- Well, what about the Super Pluses?
- No!

38:47.479 --> 38:50.034
- Why not? They sound like better.
- Don't. They're huge.

38:50.069 --> 38:51.678
I thought you liked huge.

38:51.713 --> 38:54.797
This is one area where bigger is not better.

38:54.832 --> 38:57.878
Yeah, well shouldn't you buy all the protection
you can get? I mean...

38:57.913 --> 39:00.041
it says here it can handle any amount of- oh my God!

39:00.076 --> 39:04.478
Priestly, listen. If a woman needs an
emergency... dipstick...

39:04.680 --> 39:05.964
in the ladies room of a sandwich stop...

39:05.999 --> 39:07.723
- That's nasty.
- She just wants something...

39:07.758 --> 39:10.394
that's gonna hold her over until
she can get home and use one of her own,

39:10.640 --> 39:13.916
based on her own style preferences and...
flow requirements.

39:14.320 --> 39:15.912
- Tish!
- Yeah?

39:16.520 --> 39:20.877
That word... flow.
That's nasty. It's gross.

39:21.280 --> 39:23.077
Just... buy the slender regulars.

39:24.080 --> 39:25.991
Over and out! Heading back to base camp.

39:26.200 --> 39:27.952
Roger that! Over and out.

39:35.840 --> 39:36.829
Uhm... Hi!

39:37.480 --> 39:38.469
Who was that?

39:39.760 --> 39:40.909
Uh... Priestly.

39:41.280 --> 39:42.349
Jason?

39:43.320 --> 39:46.232
No, uh... he works here.
You've seen him.

39:46.640 --> 39:49.108
Oh, yeah... the freak!

39:56.720 --> 39:58.199
- Check out this dude's dress!
- Nice!

40:11.960 --> 40:12.995
What?

40:13.320 --> 40:14.753
Nice breadsticks, dude!

40:16.240 --> 40:17.229
What, these?

40:17.880 --> 40:19.871
Dude, are you having a not so fresh day?

40:22.880 --> 40:24.950
Think it's funny that I'm buying tampons?

40:29.760 --> 40:32.069
Do you gentlemen... and I use that term loosely...

40:33.200 --> 40:34.792
understand what this means?

40:36.200 --> 40:37.474
Obviously not.

40:39.680 --> 40:41.159
This mean that...

40:42.120 --> 40:45.317
that there's a woman with whom I'm so intimate...

40:45.720 --> 40:49.269
that we're both comfortable with me buying
her most personal possessions.

40:49.304 --> 40:53.149
This means that our relationship is so solid, so trusting,

40:53.560 --> 40:55.437
that I'm not embarassed doing this at all.

40:56.800 --> 40:58.438
It means, my friends,

40:59.240 --> 41:03.453
that instead of hanging out at a grocery store
having a sausage fest with another guy

41:03.480 --> 41:10.079
playing the skin flute, or just going a little...
all day long... I'm getting laid by a beautiful lady...

41:10.400 --> 41:13.119
everyday, and she takes it downtown.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.717
And... everyone here knows it.

41:18.800 --> 41:21.598
- No high fives, dude. Just gimme some love.
- All right!

41:23.307 --> 41:24.702
Excellent!

41:32.000 --> 41:33.115
Peace!

42:16.960 --> 42:18.757
That's how she knows that I'm home...

42:19.160 --> 42:20.912
and that she's been kissed.

42:24.840 --> 42:26.353
Oh, I hate coming home this late...

42:27.560 --> 42:29.278
Yes, she tried to wait up for you, but...

42:30.160 --> 42:31.513
- eyelids went out.
- Yeah.

42:33.600 --> 42:35.272
So there's a ton of lasagna in the oven.

42:35.520 --> 42:37.351
I only know how to cook for a football team, and...

42:37.680 --> 42:40.353
Julia only had one piece, so... the rest is up to you.

42:40.388 --> 42:41.509
You didn't eat?

42:42.080 --> 42:43.274
No.

42:45.120 --> 42:47.953
Was your cooking that bad? Should I... order out?

42:48.760 --> 42:50.796
My cooking is just fine, thank you very much.

42:51.080 --> 42:52.991
I just... felt a little awkward.

42:53.360 --> 42:54.804
Well, I think you should join me.

42:54.839 --> 42:59.278
I don't... want you to feel awkward, but...
I haven't eaten.

43:01.280 --> 43:02.395
Okay.

43:08.120 --> 43:11.032
Honestly, this is the best homecooked meal I've had...

43:11.067 --> 43:12.194
since we moved here.

43:12.229 --> 43:13.879
- So where are you from?
- Pennsylvania.

43:13.914 --> 43:15.189
Really?

43:15.400 --> 43:16.500
I'm from Maryland.

43:16.535 --> 43:17.018
Really?

43:17.520 --> 43:20.353
We used to go to Maryland all the time,
we lived just across the border.

43:20.388 --> 43:22.238
We'd go down to this great little crab shop.

43:22.760 --> 43:23.829
"We"?

43:25.160 --> 43:26.673
So there's a Mrs. Miller?

43:28.840 --> 43:30.034
There used to be...

43:30.360 --> 43:31.793
...there's not anymore.

43:33.800 --> 43:35.233
You ended up with Julia?

43:36.120 --> 43:38.156
It's... unusual, isn't it?

43:50.540 --> 43:52.990
Look... I'm not really comfortable
talking about this, Anna.

44:00.600 --> 44:01.669
I'm sorry.

44:04.480 --> 44:05.879
You know, I think I'm gonna go.

44:07.360 --> 44:09.191
- Anna, look, don't go... I ju-
- No.

44:10.400 --> 44:11.719
I intruded.

44:12.600 --> 44:14.033
Anna, please!

44:14.240 --> 44:15.355
I really need to go.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.469
Thank you.

44:30.560 --> 44:32.163
Come on, Priestly, it can't be that bad.

44:32.198 --> 44:34.271
- Yes, it can.
- I can't believe you won't tell us.

44:34.480 --> 44:35.708
Leave it, baby.

44:37.960 --> 44:39.313
Morning!

44:39.680 --> 44:42.274
Hey, Truck, you'll know.
What's Priestly's first name?

44:42.840 --> 44:44.033
Beats me.

44:44.068 --> 44:46.082
Hey, but it's... gotta be on his application, right?

44:46.117 --> 44:48.748
Now that I think about it,
I'm not sure he even filled one out.

44:53.280 --> 44:55.032
Beach City Grill, subs by the inch.

44:55.067 --> 44:56.428
Hi, is Anna there?

44:56.463 --> 44:57.953
Anna?

44:59.360 --> 45:01.555
Anna! Yeah! Yeah, Anna is here.

45:05.120 --> 45:06.109
Hello?

45:07.240 --> 45:08.229
Hey, it's me.

45:09.280 --> 45:10.395
Hi.

45:10.600 --> 45:13.068
Listen, I was just calling to make sure
you're still babysitting tomorrow.

45:13.880 --> 45:15.119
Sure I am.

45:15.154 --> 45:17.709
Good, I... I was afraid you wouldn't come
because of last night. It's just...

45:18.600 --> 45:20.272
- everything with Julia's mother...
- Hey, you know what?

45:20.307 --> 45:22.282
I shouldn't have pried.

45:22.317 --> 45:24.311
You know, until Julia was two...
I just, you know...

45:25.280 --> 45:27.032
Well, let's just say it was a really weird time.

45:27.240 --> 45:28.514
I understand.

45:28.920 --> 45:30.319
Okay, great. So that's all behind us... okay?

45:31.320 --> 45:32.274
- Okay.
- Okay, I'll...

45:32.309 --> 45:34.277
- see you tomorrow then.
- Yeah.

45:44.960 --> 45:45.949
Bless you!

45:46.840 --> 45:47.955
Thank you.

45:48.600 --> 45:49.635
Bye.

46:06.280 --> 46:07.554
Okay, I've got it all worked up.

46:07.760 --> 46:09.955
We drive up saturday, check-in at the camp ground...

46:10.160 --> 46:13.311
and Trucker said that if we fold the seat down,
there's enough room for all the three of us to sleep.

46:13.640 --> 46:14.959
Yeah, right...

46:15.160 --> 46:16.752
Like you're gonna be spending the night with us...

46:18.920 --> 46:19.909
What?

46:20.520 --> 46:21.589
Nothing.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.877
- No way!
- What?!

46:27.880 --> 46:29.279
You're still the scarlet beady...

46:30.720 --> 46:33.280
So? It's not anything to be ashamed of... is it?

46:34.200 --> 46:35.837
No, it's not.

46:35.872 --> 46:38.270
If I had mantained, I wouldn't be in the mess I'm in now.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.788
Yeah... listen, it's, uhm, it's not really different
from when you do it yourself.

46:43.440 --> 46:44.839
It just... takes a lot longer.

46:47.280 --> 46:48.474
Never?

46:49.200 --> 46:51.668
You guys, I'm a computer nerd daughter of
a southern baptist minister from Wichita.

46:51.880 --> 46:54.269
I'm the worst kind of late bloomer.

46:54.520 --> 46:56.130
You've never plugged your own banjo.

46:56.165 --> 46:58.801
Come on! It's not like you guys do it all the time, right?

47:00.000 --> 47:01.069
Yesterday morning.

47:01.104 --> 47:02.409
Two days ago.

47:02.444 --> 47:03.714
Last night.

47:04.360 --> 47:07.238
Don't worry! I made Bam-Bam go in the other room.

47:12.840 --> 47:14.796
Oh... and I'm the one worried about carpal tunnel.

47:15.800 --> 47:17.995
Yeah. It's not carpal. It's one or two fingers.

47:27.600 --> 47:28.999
Nothing's happening!

47:29.280 --> 47:30.508
Keep going!

47:33.160 --> 47:35.390
I don't know you guys, maybe mine's a dud!

47:35.800 --> 47:37.677
KEEP GOING!

47:40.680 --> 47:41.749
- Ow!
- What?

47:42.000 --> 47:42.954
Very intense...

47:42.989 --> 47:45.548
- Well, just slow it down a little bit!
- Or move it to the left!

47:47.120 --> 47:49.236
This is one of those times I wish I smoked...

47:49.800 --> 47:51.519
or did origami, or something...

47:53.960 --> 47:56.474
Come on! Tadd's waiting for me!

47:56.700 --> 47:59.475
Tell him to come up here and help, if he's so impatient.

48:00.840 --> 48:03.600
So, is Brad going rollerblading with you guys, too?

48:04.040 --> 48:08.000
Tadd says he's not one of those guys who gives up
his friends when he gets a girlfriend.

48:08.520 --> 48:10.316
That's cool... I guess.

48:10.351 --> 48:12.601
I guess... but they're roommates.

48:12.636 --> 48:14.398
I mean, they see each other all the time anyway.

48:14.773 --> 48:18.801
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh... oh, my God...

48:20.280 --> 48:22.396
Ladies and gentleman, we have lift off!

48:22.640 --> 48:24.949
Elvis has left the building!

48:33.920 --> 48:35.148
Does she look different to you?

48:36.360 --> 48:38.032
Our little girl's growing up.

48:58.520 --> 48:59.509
Roll off!

49:02.960 --> 49:04.678
Baby, you are something!

49:04.713 --> 49:06.397
Something good, I hope.

49:08.560 --> 49:10.073
Yeah... something good.

49:11.840 --> 49:14.000
Hey, I got us tickets for "The Catalyst" on saturday.

49:14.400 --> 49:16.231
Oh... bummer! I'm going out of town.

49:16.640 --> 49:17.594
Where are you going?

49:17.629 --> 49:19.950
Morro Bay, but just for saturday night.

49:20.280 --> 49:21.793
Can't you get out of it?

49:22.200 --> 49:24.162
- Hm-Hm, I'm going with Jen and Piper.
- Who?

49:24.197 --> 49:27.909
My friends from the shop...
Jen's mystery man, remember?

49:28.880 --> 49:30.800
Yeah, right... look, can't you just
tell them you got a better offer?

49:31.640 --> 49:32.834
But I didn't.

49:33.960 --> 49:35.439
Well, fuck you very much!

49:35.640 --> 49:38.200
I'm sorry, but there's no way I'm standing Jen up.

49:38.920 --> 49:40.717
Next time just ask first.

49:40.960 --> 49:42.154
Whatever...

49:42.360 --> 49:44.157
So we have to find someone else
to use the third ticket.

49:45.360 --> 49:47.635
"We"?
As in "Brad"?

49:47.670 --> 49:49.911
Yeah, as in "Brad".

49:50.120 --> 49:52.156
Right, good. Is Brad coming on all of our dates?

49:52.191 --> 49:53.684
What is the fucking big deal?

49:53.719 --> 49:55.563
You have your friends, I have mine.

49:55.598 --> 49:57.357
True, but I don't bring mine everywhere I go.

49:57.392 --> 49:59.317
You're not one of those possessive chicks, are you?

49:59.520 --> 50:01.750
The kind that doesn't want me
to have a life away from her?

50:02.040 --> 50:03.074
- No.
- Good!

50:03.109 --> 50:04.992
Because I'm not gonna put up with that shit.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.800
Look, just... forget I said anything, okay?

50:08.840 --> 50:10.398
I don't know why, I'm being weird.

50:10.600 --> 50:12.556
Hey, call in sick...

50:13.880 --> 50:15.233
Spend the day with me.

50:16.880 --> 50:19.758
Girl's gotta work. Besides,
I don't have a rich daddy.

50:20.600 --> 50:21.874
Thought we could have a little fun.

50:21.909 --> 50:23.837
We will... tonight.

51:01.480 --> 51:02.595
Daddy!

51:03.800 --> 51:04.949
Hey, kiddo!

51:05.920 --> 51:07.148
- Well, you'll never guess what happened.
- What?

51:07.880 --> 51:10.474
All the power went out at the school,
so they sent everybody home.

51:11.120 --> 51:12.279
Now, ain't that a shame?

51:12.314 --> 51:13.993
- I can tell you're really broken up about it.
- Yeah.

51:15.160 --> 51:17.913
So I figured, if you feel like,
we'd go down to the boardwalk one last time...

51:17.948 --> 51:19.359
before they close the rides down for the winter...

51:19.394 --> 51:20.764
Awesome!

51:20.799 --> 51:24.350
And you know what? If we're lucky, we might
just be able to get Anna to come with us.

51:25.040 --> 51:28.759
Anna, please!
Daddy won't take me on any spinning rides.

51:28.794 --> 51:32.509
'Cause Daddy doesn't do spinning rides,
because spinning rides remind Daddy

51:32.544 --> 51:36.599
of how he used to feel after frat parties.
Just... dizzy and sick.

51:37.400 --> 51:40.631
Daddy doesn't do 'em, you can't make me
do 'em, it's not gonna happen.

51:42.690 --> 51:45.951
Woo! Rock party! I fly!

51:46.327 --> 51:47.549
You doing the right thing, Noah?

51:47.831 --> 51:48.975
Not really, no!

52:08.240 --> 52:11.152
- Daddy, can I go play the dart game?
- Yes, you can!

52:11.800 --> 52:12.915
- Here's the tickets.
- Thanks!

52:14.000 --> 52:15.194
Watch me!

52:17.720 --> 52:18.709
Okay, so look... I don't...

52:19.800 --> 52:23.110
wanna be a walking cliché and hit on
the babysitter, but...

52:25.680 --> 52:28.069
I want you to know that I like coming home
and finding you there.

52:28.560 --> 52:29.834
I do.

52:33.320 --> 52:37.871
So... bear with me on this, because I haven't...
done this in a long time, but...

52:39.960 --> 52:44.636
would you be interested at all in...
spending more time with the entire Miller family?

52:45.680 --> 52:47.636
Not just Julia, but...

52:47.671 --> 52:49.074
with me?

52:53.160 --> 52:54.513
The deep sigh...

52:54.548 --> 52:55.715
Okay...

52:56.000 --> 52:57.149
No. Nope...

52:58.080 --> 53:00.719
The answer is "yes". A big yes.

53:00.920 --> 53:02.148
Yeah?

53:07.440 --> 53:10.034
There's a few things I think we need
to be honest about first.

53:13.080 --> 53:14.479
You're really a man?

53:16.040 --> 53:18.759
Only from the waist down.
That doesn't bother you, does it?

53:19.040 --> 53:21.349
No, not at all! I like a girl that's hung.

53:26.320 --> 53:27.309
- Daddy!
- Hey!

53:28.000 --> 53:29.194
Guess what I won!

53:29.400 --> 53:31.196
Uh... gee, I give up. What?

53:31.231 --> 53:32.594
Well, I'll give you a hint. And here licks the hint!

53:36.160 --> 53:37.354
Fireworks!

53:37.600 --> 53:38.749
Pretty cool, huh?

53:45.800 --> 53:47.233
I know what you mean about honesty, though.

53:48.680 --> 53:49.795
- You do?
- Yeah.

53:50.640 --> 53:52.471
We'll talk later.

54:02.840 --> 54:06.915
All right, so we have chocolate, sleeping bags, food,
personal items, chocolate, money, chocolate, and beer.

54:07.840 --> 54:09.239
Do you think we have enough chocolate?

54:09.960 --> 54:11.109
I'll add it.

54:18.080 --> 54:19.444
Oh, was that Tadd all pissed off?

54:19.479 --> 54:22.876
Yeah, he's turked about something as usual. He'll recover.

54:23.160 --> 54:27.039
Good. I was worried he was mad at me for a second.
Imagine that.

54:28.240 --> 54:29.514
I know. You're okay.

54:33.600 --> 54:35.591
Hey, Jen, did you do something different with your hair?

54:35.800 --> 54:37.118
No, why?

54:37.153 --> 54:38.799
I don't know, you just look different.

54:44.160 --> 54:45.752
- You told him?
- No.

54:46.200 --> 54:48.589
All right angels, cosmobile is ready to roll!

54:48.960 --> 54:50.279
THANKS, CHARLIE!

54:54.520 --> 54:55.794
- Greetings, everyone!
- Hey, Zo!

55:02.680 --> 55:04.796
Take care of the temple, Truck.

55:10.200 --> 55:11.633
I made this for your trip.

55:13.360 --> 55:14.349
Does that have chocolate in it?

55:14.800 --> 55:16.199
Sadly, no.

55:16.560 --> 55:20.155
This is a mixture of ground herbs, petals and pots.

55:20.440 --> 55:23.637
It will bring wholesomeness and protection
to you on your journey.

55:24.080 --> 55:25.274
Thank you, Zo.

55:32.520 --> 55:36.718
It's not a sin, Jen. It's a celebration.
Enjoy it freely.

55:39.800 --> 55:42.951
Now, for this to work, you have to hold each other...

55:43.160 --> 55:47.153
and release it into the wind blowing off the ocean.

55:47.480 --> 55:48.708
Okay!

55:52.320 --> 55:53.514
I have to run.

55:53.960 --> 55:55.837
I'm making lentle and tofu soup.

55:56.120 --> 55:57.439
Stop by if you want some.

55:57.960 --> 55:59.075
Hey, Zo!

55:59.480 --> 56:03.029
Are you vegetarian because you love animals,
or because you hate plants?

56:03.960 --> 56:05.313
Oh... I do love you, Priestly.

56:05.920 --> 56:08.718
Hey, I'm... babysitting here by myself
all weekend, I'd...

56:09.840 --> 56:11.432
love it if you took a shift.

57:52.419 --> 57:56.365
If this turns out to be the ashes of Zo's
first husband, I'm gonna freak.

58:19.680 --> 58:21.272
I really don't think this is necessary.

58:21.680 --> 58:22.874
It looks better down.

58:27.800 --> 58:29.870
- What are you doing?
- No... it needs more lift.

58:30.520 --> 58:31.839
It's not gonna get more lift.

58:32.080 --> 58:34.594
You guys, just... I just want him
to see the real me.

58:35.480 --> 58:37.357
Oh no no! No. You never show the
real you on a first date.

58:38.000 --> 58:39.956
- I think you look beautiful.
- Thank you.

58:40.720 --> 58:42.073
Different somehow.

58:52.080 --> 58:53.672
- So, do you know what he drives?
- No.

58:55.040 --> 58:56.632
No, of course not. That would be too easy.

58:56.667 --> 58:57.994
What difference would it make?

58:58.200 --> 58:59.234
Lots!

58:59.269 --> 59:03.279
Suppose he drives some beat-up piece of shit
held together by duct tape and dental floss...

59:03.520 --> 59:05.033
"All you need is love."

59:07.520 --> 59:10.318
And what if he has, like, NRA and skinhead stickers all over it?

59:11.000 --> 59:12.558
Then "we can work it out".

59:12.760 --> 59:14.835
It's Beatles red show night at the Morro Bay...

59:14.870 --> 59:16.911
We're accepting Fab Four requests all night long.

59:17.640 --> 59:21.189
What if he's "The Fool on the Hill"... or "The Nowhere Man"?

59:21.680 --> 59:23.591
Tish... "Let it Be".

59:24.200 --> 59:26.430
Besides, "everybody's got something to hide...

59:26.720 --> 59:28.756
- EXCEPT ME AND MY MONKEY"!
- Stop it!

59:30.240 --> 59:31.399
All right, so this is what we have to do:

59:31.434 --> 59:33.477
We have to find a table in the back or in the corner,

59:33.512 --> 59:35.591
so that we can scope him or her out in advance.

59:35.840 --> 59:38.149
And, if he's an extra from "Road Warrior", we bolt.

59:38.360 --> 59:40.476
Maybe we should send Tish past him and see if he checks her out.

59:40.511 --> 59:42.995
If he doesn't check Tish out, he's either gay or dead.

59:43.030 --> 59:44.712
That's true. Nevermind.

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:04.871
Okay... remember you guys: white rose.

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:17.398
C'mon Alice, move your ass!

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:30.709
Maybe that's him.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:33.513
So-so.

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:36.316
I told you, I don't care about looks.

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:41.629
Do you think that's him?

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.638
You want me to walk by the table and check?

01:00:43.673 --> 01:00:44.749
Wait.

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:49.553
I'm gonna guess that's not him.

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.233
Unless he were on a date.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:38.874
Oh my God!

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:42.909
That settles it. I have got to get my DSL hooked up.

01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:50.758
Oh... is that a face made for sitting on or what?

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:16.675
Come on, Jen...

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:19.513
Please talk to us.

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:24.792
Look, do you want me to... to go back down and
tell Fuzzy22 that you had cold feet or...?

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:25.994
No.

01:02:26.029 --> 01:02:29.232
Come on, why not, Jen?
I mean, he came a long way to meet you...

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:31.951
I don't know what you saw that we missed.

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:36.438
All I saw was... just a guy looking for the girl of his dreams.

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:40.154
A guy like that doesn't dream about a girl like me.

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:42.032
Is this about how cute he was?

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:43.837
And I thought you'd be happy.

01:02:43.872 --> 01:02:46.429
and not to mention, you know, pretty damn relieved.

01:02:46.464 --> 01:02:48.875
Besides, you said that looks don't matter.

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:51.753
Yeah, that was before I knew he was Brad-fucking-Pitt!

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:57.514
There's no way a guy who looks like that is gonna want me.

01:02:57.549 --> 01:02:58.669
That's crazy.

01:02:58.704 --> 01:02:59.749
Is it?

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:01.479
I mean, look at Tadd.

01:03:01.514 --> 01:03:04.752
When he came into the shop he didn't
exactly beelined me, did he?

01:03:04.787 --> 01:03:07.991
Okay, but Tadd is a superficial dickhead,
everybody knows that.

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:10.952
Everyone except Tish. Sorry.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.878
I mean, girls that look like you don't understand...

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:21.797
You know, I always think like...

01:03:21.832 --> 01:03:25.151
if I lost ten pounds, or... wear different clothes, or...

01:03:25.292 --> 01:03:28.496
got new boobs, that it would make a difference, but...

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:30.354
I know the truth.

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:32.232
I'm sorry, but that's bullshit.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.956
You're the smartest person that I know.

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:41.596
When I see you helping those homeless guys
that no one can even look at...

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:45.669
you make everyone around you happy.

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:48.478
You have so much to offer.

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:53.077
I mean, to say you don't just because of
how you look it's just... it's just a whole bullshit.

01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:56.556
I didn't say I don't have a lot to offer.

01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:59.792
I said that people will never know
because they don't see me.

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:08.232
How many proms did you miss because
no one asked you?

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:11.639
How many times have your friends left you
sitting alone at a club...

01:04:11.674 --> 01:04:13.398
while they went and danced with guys?

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:17.275
Or how many times has a customer completely
ignored you to get a better look at me?

01:04:21.917 --> 01:04:23.760
So until that happens...

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:28.359
Until you're told time and time again
that your place in life is in the background...

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:31.552
...don't tell me it's bullshit.

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:33.839
Because you don't know.

01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:49.234
All I saw tonight was a man with eyes full of hope.

01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:51.349
Hope...

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:54.349
That would've turned to disappointment,
the second he saw me.

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:56.440
A forced smile...

01:04:56.475 --> 01:04:58.119
a polite conversation...

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:02.438
God, I couldn't stand that!

01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:05.198
Not after all this.

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:43.108
All right!

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:47.109
I've been sitting by the phone, waiting, wondering...

01:06:47.144 --> 01:06:49.310
I demand a full report, I want all the details!

01:06:49.345 --> 01:06:50.469
What happened?

01:06:51.413 --> 01:06:54.542
Okay, look... uhm... there's a particular reason
we didn't call you...

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:05.389
Are you okay?

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:09.034
You're shitting me?

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:11.989
Jen!

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:15.353
Please, tell me you din't leave Fuzzy
just sitting down there wondering.

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.639
God damn it, Jen!

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.837
I don't expect you to understand.

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:24.995
No, I understand.

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:30.712
I understand you wouldn't talk to him because you were
terrified he was gonna judge you on the basis of your looks.

01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:34.632
Yet you're completely comfortable doing
the exact same thing to him!

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.039
That's unbelievable. God!

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:55.834
What?

01:07:55.869 --> 01:07:57.353
Why are you pissed at me?

01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:58.788
I'm not pissed at you.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.629
I mean, not you specifically, more as like
a representative member of your gender.

01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:05.438
Oh, come on... look, that was really hard on Jen.

01:08:05.473 --> 01:08:08.712
Oh, really? Really, Tish? 'Cause I'm sure
it was a picnic for Fuzzy, too.

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:12.151
Why are you suddenly Fuzzy's best friend?

01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:14.309
Why?

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:15.669
Because it's pathetic, Tish, okay?

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.669
It's pathetic that you can't rise above all this
superficial horseshit that's whirling around her.

01:08:20.399 --> 01:08:24.072
I mean, why is it, why is it that some people can't see
a good thing when it's standing right in front of them, huh?

01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:26.631
And what is it that screws all that up?

01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:28.673
Can you tell me?

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:30.678
I swear, you're like a two-year-old.

01:08:30.712 --> 01:08:32.791
You're more interested in the wrapping paper
than what's inside.

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:34.669
Wait.

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:38.795
Are you talking about Jen or me?

01:08:39.736 --> 01:08:41.901
If there's a difference, let me know.

01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:55.394
Hey Jen.

01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:58.313
Just leave it. You've had a long day
and I'll close it up.

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:00.194
You sure?

01:09:00.399 --> 01:09:01.879
Yeah... yeah, go home and get drunk.

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:04.787
Thank you.

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:14.319
- I'll, hmm... I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yep.

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:04.629
On your back!

01:10:08.043 --> 01:10:09.988
Let's get these off.

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:16.829
- Oh my God!
- Oh, yeah!

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:18.439
- No! No! NO!

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:21.679
What are you doing, asshole?

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:24.196
Come on, Tish, it's just Brad.

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:26.356
- Yeah, relax Tish, it's cool.
- Get out!

01:10:26.391 --> 01:10:27.949
Tish, I live here.

01:10:27.984 --> 01:10:29.473
You know what I mean!

01:10:29.508 --> 01:10:32.473
Come one... what's the big deal?
Haven't you ever had a threesome before?

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:34.831
It's fun, we'll show you.
We do it all the time.

01:10:34.866 --> 01:10:36.244
Oh, no! Forget it!

01:10:36.279 --> 01:10:38.914
Where are you going?
I can't believe you're getting so fucked up about it!

01:10:38.949 --> 01:10:40.798
It's not like you're the most moral chick on the planet!

01:10:40.833 --> 01:10:41.949
What?!

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:44.071
Look, one of the reasons I dug you so much
is because you're obviously...

01:10:44.106 --> 01:10:47.397
- Experimental.
- Yeah! Experimental.

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:50.270
God... well, science class is over, children!

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:54.193
- Oh, come on, Tish!
- You know you want me.

01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:56.229
What's the big deal?

01:10:56.264 --> 01:10:57.314
Let go of me!

01:10:57.349 --> 01:10:58.634
- Get on the bed...
- Get out of my way! Let go!

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:06.789
Oh my God!

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.228
Now look what you did...

01:11:08.263 --> 01:11:09.679
What I did?!

01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:11.632
Get the fuck away from me!

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:16.279
Bye, Tish! I'll be here waiting.

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.078
People are stupid, they just don't think like that.

01:11:21.113 --> 01:11:23.082
Okay Priestly, this time you're uber-wacked.

01:11:23.117 --> 01:11:25.037
I'm just saying Cobain wasn't trying to leave this world...

01:11:25.072 --> 01:11:26.553
All right? He was just tryin' to leave Courtney.

01:11:26.588 --> 01:11:27.669
I buy it.

01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:32.429
Oh, shit... what happened?

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:36.553
Oh... yeah, isn't it beautiful? I mean,
when I klutz out, I really klutz out.

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.155
What did you do?

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:42.959
I was... rollerblading out on West Cliff
and I wasn't paying attention...

01:11:42.994 --> 01:11:46.318
And I hit some ice plant and... went down.
It's just... not a big deal.

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:52.199
You guys, I'm fine!

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:54.277
So, uh... who are we trashin' today?

01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:55.637
Courtney Love.

01:11:55.672 --> 01:11:56.755
Good, I hate her.

01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:58.598
Yeah, I wish she'd hit some ice plant. GUH!

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:05.354
You know, the parenting books all say it's
supposed to be easier to put kids to sleep...

01:12:05.389 --> 01:12:08.040
in the winter, because it gets dark earlier.

01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:10.559
I think they're lying.

01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:14.111
Maybe she's just an exceptional kid.

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:18.677
Yeah... that must be it.
Couldn't possibly mean that I'm a lame father.

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:24.153
Okay, Noah, here it goes.

01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:27.473
I have something to tell you.

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:29.713
Something major.

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:34.712
I have something to tell you, too.

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:38.112
Something no one knows about Julia, I've...

01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:40.354
never told anyone.

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:43.878
I think you should go first then.

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:47.153
I think your thing relates to my thing.

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:48.794
Okay.

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:51.034
Well, my thing is this:

01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:54.271
Julia's mother lives on the East Coast...

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:58.392
and is... legally barred from seeing Julia
until her 18th birthday.

01:12:58.427 --> 01:12:59.469
What?

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:01.309
Why?

01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:05.275
When Julia was five months old,
her mother tried to kill them both.

01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:08.196
She sat in the car, holding Julia...

01:13:08.231 --> 01:13:10.003
with the exhaust piped in.

01:13:10.038 --> 01:13:15.311
Fortunately, a neighbour who was letting his dog shit in the
frontyard heard the engine, broke a window and saved them.

01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:17.478
What happened then?

01:13:17.513 --> 01:13:20.473
Hospital, medicine, therapy, everything.

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:24.234
Very slowly...

01:13:24.269 --> 01:13:26.749
I started leaving her with Julia alone again.

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:30.315
Then, right after her third birthday,

01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:32.317
I got a call at work.

01:13:32.352 --> 01:13:34.829
We were toilet-training Julia...

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:36.599
and I guess...

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:39.789
she had an accident in her pants.

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:43.193
Her mother held her hand on the toilet bowl and...

01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:47.232
slammed the lid down.

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:49.476
Broke two of her fingers and three bones.

01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:51.758
And, so, I...

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:55.031
filed for divorce and custody.

01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:56.593
Obviously, got both.

01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:01.118
Then we packed up the car and moved
out here to start a new life.

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:05.558
Does Julia remember any of this?

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:07.876
No, no... I dont think so.

01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:10.918
I mean, she used to say:

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:15.559
"Mummy hurt me, so she doesn't live here anymore"
over and over, but...

01:14:15.594 --> 01:14:17.153
it soon stopped.

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:19.312
Must have been so hard...

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:23.310
Well, my responsibility as a parent is
to protect my child.

01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:28.118
I can accept the suicide attempt,
that is post-partum depression, but...

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:31.230
everything else was a clear patten of abuse.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.115
What?

01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:42.638
- Post-partum depression?
- Yeah.

01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:47.951
But you... have to give birth for that to happen.

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:48.740
Ah... yeah...

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:52.152
But Julia is adopted.

01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:55.113
What?! She's not, why... why would you think that?

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:57.674
Yes, she is!

01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:00.918
No she's not, Anna... I... I was in the delivery room at the hospital.

01:15:00.953 --> 01:15:02.308
She's not adopted.

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:04.790
Jesus Christ, you look like you're gonna be sick!

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:07.952
Christ, Anna! What's wrong?

01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:09.839
She's not my baby?

01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:11.632
What?!
No! Anna...

01:15:11.667 --> 01:15:12.988
I'm not Anna!

01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:15.474
I'm not anyone!

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:18.359
Anna!

01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:59.234
You're ready to go, babe?

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:04.274
Hey Trucker, can I leave ten minutes early?

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:07.916
Sure, angel. Just be careful, if you go rollerblading.

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.636
I don't like the way that old hippie calls you "angel".

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:26.073
Look, I didn't want to make a scene in there.
There's no way I'm ever going out with you again.

01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:27.939
Why, because you got a little bruise?

01:16:27.974 --> 01:16:29.518
You can't blame me if you're... clumsy.

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:31.039
Clumsy?!

01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:35.191
This would have never happened if you and Brad hadn't
tried to force me to do something I didn't want to do!

01:16:35.358 --> 01:16:37.471
Forced you? Gimme a break, come on, get...

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:39.789
Get in the car!

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:42.754
Look, why don't you and Brad just admit that
the girl's unnecessary...

01:16:42.789 --> 01:16:44.034
and get on with it?

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:46.520
What are you talking about?

01:16:46.555 --> 01:16:49.319
Are you so far in the closet you can't see the light?

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:51.958
You and Brad are hot for each other.

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:54.676
You just use the girl to pretend you're straight.

01:16:58.440 --> 01:16:59.555
You listen to me!

01:16:59.590 --> 01:17:00.779
I'm no fag.

01:17:00.789 --> 01:17:02.911
I was captain of the football team in high school.

01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:07.035
Let me guess...

01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:11.750
You were a Tight End, always to afraid of
becoming a Wide Receiver?

01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:15.839
Why don't you just be a man and admit what you are?

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:17.998
No one cares that you're gay.

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:21.716
If you ever call me queer again, I swear-

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:28.719
You do not hit her! You piece of shit!

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:32.272
What is it with you guys?
Fine, she's a waste of time anyway.

01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:34.995
You okay?

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.149
Hey! Shithead!

01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:49.038
Why don't you try the old hippie?

01:17:49.073 --> 01:17:50.114
Trucker, don't!

01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:51.564
What is it with you people?

01:17:51.599 --> 01:17:53.950
She's a cheap piece of ass! Who cares about her?

01:17:53.985 --> 01:17:55.553
That's it, pretty boy...

01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:57.358
Keep talking.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.635
You listen to me, you dickless yuppie!

01:18:12.670 --> 01:18:15.270
Tish is a lady and she's my friend!

01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:19.357
If I ever see you around her,
they'll be wanting your picture...

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:22.751
on "Unsolved Mysteries". You got it?

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.117
Does anyone else think that Trucker
might have... some explaining do to?

01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:41.588
Let's go to my pad.

01:18:51.339 --> 01:18:52.569
Are you okay?

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:03.153
I don't believe it...

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:05.838
Gordon Hancock?!

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:07.679
Senior class prez...

01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:10.713
Captain of the football team...
No Woodstock?

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.355
No free love, no peace rallies?

01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:15.995
Yeah, I took the free love when I could get it. I mean...

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:17.884
- No bongs?
- Well...

01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:19.996
- No Grateful Dead concerts?
- That came later.

01:19:20.031 --> 01:19:21.718
What happened?

01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:25.118
Oh, pff... I got drafted.

01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:27.879
I found out I was a sneaky son of a bitch...

01:19:27.914 --> 01:19:31.112
good at... killing people before
they even knew that I was there.

01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:33.795
It's funny what you can learn about yourself.

01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:35.149
Geez...

01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:39.154
Did three tours... lost count of the bodies
somewhere in the second...

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.436
So, God knows how many souls I gotta face somday...

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:47.557
So, when was Trucker born?

01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:53.597
Well... when I got home, I started taking
long walks at night on the beach, and...

01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:56.435
met some crazy ass surfers...

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:02.235
They made me smile, you know? For the
first time since I had gotten back.

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:03.959
I bought a board...

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:05.593
and changed my name.

01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:11.590
But I swore that I would never...
hurt another human as long as I lived.

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.750
I'm sorry I made you break your promise.

01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:28.554
Oh, no.

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:31.949
I said I would never hurt another "human"...

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:34.957
So I'm cool with that, angel.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.672
But, promise me something?

01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:39.109
Anything.

01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:43.438
No more shitheads. You know, like,
date a... a nice guy.

01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:48.799
The problem is...

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.956
guys like that don't ask me out.

01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:55.792
Well, maybe they could ask the
wizard for some courage.

01:20:57.680 --> 01:20:59.671
That's it, isn't it?
Courage.

01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:01.717
That's why you won't ask Zo out?

01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:03.483
You're afraid she won't like your past.

01:21:03.518 --> 01:21:05.995
She's just all about love and... and peace, and...

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.678
I don't think she'd accept it.

01:21:08.713 --> 01:21:10.239
I wouldn't even know how to tell her.

01:21:10.274 --> 01:21:12.197
I don't think you have to.

01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:19.031
Zo is in your yearbook.
Look... it's her.

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:22.796
Oh my God... it's really Zo!
Get out of here.

01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:26.915
- She's cute!
- Come on, pass it back!

01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:30.719
Ah... Trucker!

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:32.797
- How did I miss that?
- I like!

01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:39.229
Hey!

01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:42.592
You can't hide forever, Anna...

01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:44.953
or whatever your name is.

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:47.159
What do you want?

01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:50.633
I want the truth. You owe me that much.

01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:57.999
So you came out here because you saw a picture
of a girl you thought might be your daughter?

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:01.435
No!

01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:03.559
The pieces fit.

01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:05.159
Age, looks...

01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:07.399
artistic ability!

01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:12.476
The mother told me that she was gonna name her
Julia and that her husband's name was Noah.

01:22:12.511 --> 01:22:14.676
Still, I don't see why you just didn't ask.

01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:20.159
When you were vague about her past I assumed that was
because you didn't want me to know that she was adopted.

01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:22.871
That sounds like wishful thinking.

01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:26.673
Why would you lie about your name?

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:31.318
There aren't that many Pipers running around.

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:35.354
I was afraid you'd remember my name
from the adoption papers.

01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:37.792
Anna is my middle name.

01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:42.396
Look, I never intended on becoming part of your lives.

01:22:42.431 --> 01:22:43.993
I just wanted to know that she was okay.

01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:46.591
But you did, Anna. You became part of our lives,
and now it just...

01:22:46.626 --> 01:22:48.950
it just seems like a lie.

01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:52.393
You know, I didn't want to give up my baby!

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:54.073
I was forced to!

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:57.995
I mean, what would you do if Julia was taken from you?
Wouldn't you think about her every day for the rest of your life?

01:22:58.030 --> 01:23:00.076
- Yeah, of course...
- Then why is it any different for me?

01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:03.832
I mean, why is my love for my child just
a whim while yours is real?

01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:06.958
Of course, you have your child,
so you can afford to be judgemental.

01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:11.229
All I have is the ghosts of two Julias.

01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:14.555
I loved them both, and I lost them both.

01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:29.193
So, you always knew about... me being in the war?

01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:32.632
You were three years behind me?

01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:37.278
Of course I was... crazy for you.

01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:39.552
All the girls were.

01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:42.556
You never paid much attention to the freshman girls.

01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:45.309
Especially not nerdy, flat-chested ones.

01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:49.835
You know, Trucker, no matter how much you grow up...

01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:54.719
sometimes high school is right there,
breathing down your neck.

01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:01.556
It just blows my mind that...
I was your high school fantasy.

01:24:01.591 --> 01:24:02.869
It's true.

01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:07.596
So, what did you fantasize about us?

01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:09.836
Watching the sunset at the beach?

01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:12.109
Sometimes.

01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:14.516
Yeah... what else?

01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:16.714
Stuff.

01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:19.194
Tell me.

01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:23.556
Trucker, my high school fantasy was...

01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:28.918
that we were in love.

01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:32.353
That... when we looked in each other's eyes

01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:34.638
time would stand still...

01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:38.073
and our hearts would forever beat as one.

01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:50.791
I'm sorry it took so long.

01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:55.033
That's okay.

01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:18.389
Are you guys...?

01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:19.029
Oh, ladies first.

01:25:19.058 --> 01:25:19.936
Thank you.

01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:23.758
- Good evening. Did you find everything all right?
- Yep.

01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:35.670
- Your total's $9.35.
- Thanks.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.672
Thank you. Have a good night.

01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:45.309
- This sucks, dude!
- Seriously!

01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:47.549
Hey, I'm putting the stuff back.

01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:49.951
Wait, wait, wait... keep the lube.

01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:54.559
You people are too naive!

01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:56.592
So you're saying that Chapman did pull the trigger?

01:25:56.627 --> 01:25:57.788
Affirmative!

01:25:57.823 --> 01:25:58.949
Order up!

01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:01.039
But he was just a CIA puppet.

01:26:01.074 --> 01:26:03.037
No, he was programmed, right down-the-line!

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.993
- No, no. The threat was over, man. By then he was just doing sappy love songs for Yoko, and...
- What?!

01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:10.835
No, no... Lennon was coming alive again.

01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:13.755
Reagan had just taken offers, he had to be taken out.

01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:17.596
Exactly! Thank you! Thanks.
See? Genious!

01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:24.192
- Can you hold this?
- Sure.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.150
- Stay close, Julia!
- I will!

01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:31.792
Okay, so here's the deal:

01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:35.916
Julia and I took a vote, and there's
a definite vacancy in the family.

01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:39.832
Job is yours, if you want it.

01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:42.553
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:47.158
Only one ground rule:

01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:49.995
Nothing but honesty from now on.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.479
I swear.

01:26:58.400 --> 01:26:59.515
- Noah?
- Hm?

01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:02.948
- That shirt's a really nasty color.
- Okay, not that honest.

01:27:02.983 --> 01:27:04.638
Hey, I'm just trying to get started somewhere.

01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:43.749
- Hey man.
- Hi.

01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:46.590
- Are you hungry?
- No.

01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:53.274
Okay, uhm... how can I help?

01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:54.954
You're pretty.

01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:59.032
Oh, I don't... I don't know about that.

01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:01.913
I do.

01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:06.034
Well, thank you.

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:08.798
You're very pretty.

01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:12.475
And you're exactly who I'd hoped you'd be...

01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:19.993
Ladybugger.

01:28:57.320 --> 01:28:59.038
I punk'd you, baby!

01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:04.437
Gotta remember to log off your computer, Jen.

01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:07.908
Can we...

01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:12.274
...can we go somewhere and talk?
Face to face, for a change?

01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:15.153
I'd like that.

01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:19.471
Uhm... I'm Jeff Kenline, by the way.

01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:22.795
It's a pleasure to meet you, Jeff Kenline.

01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:26.235
- Hey, dude!
- Yeah?

01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:29.237
Uh... what did you get "Fuzzy22" from?

01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:32.755
I got that account when I was working on my senior thesis.

01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:36.118
It was on fuzzy logic and I was 22.

01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:38.677
Why? Did you think I was a cop or something?

01:29:38.712 --> 01:29:40.432
No, of course not!

01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:43.070
That'd be stupid... a cop.

01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:55.438
Who says "a cop"... I mean, honestly, "fuzzy"...

01:29:55.611 --> 01:29:56.853
Did you do that?

01:29:59.113 --> 01:30:00.081
Awesome!

01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:17.638
So, one tuna sub... and veggie sub.

01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:24.948
- Uh, about... ten minutes.
- All right.

01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:31.479
All right, what can I get for you?

01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:38.153
Holy shit!

01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:44.192
Miss Matheson, it would be my pleasure
if you would agree to...

01:30:44.292 --> 01:30:46.352
accompany me to dinner tonight.

01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:51.309
Depends.

01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:52.828
On what?

01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:55.152
I wanna know your first name.

01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:56.549
Yeah!

01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:00.278
Come one, gimme a break!

01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:03.311
I went to Banana Republic, for Christ's sake!

01:31:09.909 --> 01:31:10.986
Dammit!

01:31:13.684 --> 01:31:14.308
...Boaz.

01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:17.754
Can't hear you.

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:23.030
Boaz, all right?
My first name is Boaz.

01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:24.952
- Boaz?!
- Shut up!

01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:30.153
Can I tell you something, Boaz?

01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:33.828
Okay.

01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:36.349
This is something... I've never told anyone else.

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:38.999
Yeah, of course.

01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:41.348
Tish...

01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:44.471
is short for "Platisha".

01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:47.456
Platisha?

01:31:47.491 --> 01:31:48.953
Platisha.

01:31:53.870 --> 01:31:54.580
That's good.

01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:01.233
Oh, there's something I should mention, uh... Platisha.

01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:03.238
And what's that, Boaz?

01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:07.230
Well... see, with women... there's never... I mean, I've never...

01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:10.198
Don't try it.

01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:21.794
Is that a "yes"?

01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:24.192
Yes, Boaz!

01:32:58.480 --> 01:32:59.879
Dad!

01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:08.793
- We asked you here today... - It's all right. -
... in this most sacred and beautiful of places...

01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:12.957
to witness our dedication to each other.
