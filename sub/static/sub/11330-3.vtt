WEBVTT

00:10.637 --> 00:12.905
I guess after
25 years of me,
she's had enough.

00:12.939 --> 00:14.773
Do you hope
things will work out
with Ricky and me?

00:14.808 --> 00:16.775
I've told you
more than once that
it won't work out

00:16.810 --> 00:18.710
if you just
move in there without
any kind of commitment.

00:18.745 --> 00:21.491
Hey, I'm sorry about the move,
but I talked to Grant
and he's cool with it.

00:21.525 --> 00:23.627
<i>What move?</i>

00:23.661 --> 00:25.823
I told Jack he could move
into the house and take Tom's
old room until school's out.

00:25.858 --> 00:28.923
You felt the same way
when I moved into the guest
house, and nothing happened.

00:28.957 --> 00:31.861
I still don't like
your living in the house
in the bedroom next to Grace.

00:31.895 --> 00:33.836
I got married
because I had to get married.

00:33.870 --> 00:35.713
And no, I do not
want to be married.

00:35.747 --> 00:38.716
I don't think
I'd say anything about
this stuff to anyone else.

00:38.751 --> 00:39.885
I want out.

00:39.920 --> 00:41.586
I'm afraid
he's going to
leave me.

00:41.621 --> 00:42.588
I keep telling everyone
he won't...

00:42.622 --> 00:43.790
But I'm afraid he will.

00:43.824 --> 00:45.597
Apparently Camille
is in love with you.

00:45.632 --> 00:47.500
That's why she quit.
What?

00:47.534 --> 00:50.905
I want you to be
honest with me and not
keep anything from me,

00:50.939 --> 00:53.811
and I want to be free to be
honest with you and not keep
anything from you.

00:53.846 --> 00:55.747
I really would like
to go and talk
to your dad.

00:55.781 --> 00:57.750
I don't want your family
to be upset with us.

01:01.958 --> 01:03.760
Come on, John,
Grandma's here.

01:03.795 --> 01:06.764
Why is Grandma
here so early?
We don't know.

01:08.768 --> 01:11.637
Oh, that's Grandmas.

01:11.671 --> 01:12.739
Two of them.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.642
Looks like you were
right, Margaret.

01:14.676 --> 01:16.611
Good morning.
Good morning.

01:16.646 --> 01:18.682
What's going on?
Is everything okay?

01:18.716 --> 01:20.751
Oh, no.
"Oh, no" is right.

01:20.785 --> 01:24.523
Ricky, don't you think
it'd be appropriate
to tell your mothers

01:24.558 --> 01:26.792
when you decide to make
a big decision like this?

01:26.827 --> 01:27.960
And your father?

01:27.994 --> 01:29.562
Big decision like what?

01:29.596 --> 01:31.831
Uh, like you two
are cohabitating.

01:31.865 --> 01:35.902
Not us two. Us three.
It's the three of us.

01:35.936 --> 01:39.574
Yeah, we decided
we didn't want to make
any big announcement.

01:39.608 --> 01:40.976
We didn't want it
to be a big deal.

01:41.010 --> 01:42.578
Because it's not
a big deal.

01:42.612 --> 01:43.979
Yeah? So, if it's
not such a big deal,

01:44.014 --> 01:47.918
why couldn't you just
tell us that you three
were living together?

01:47.952 --> 01:49.686
What she said.

01:52.757 --> 01:53.824
How'd you find out?

01:53.859 --> 01:55.626
Same way I find
everything out.

01:55.661 --> 01:56.828
People tell me things.

01:56.862 --> 01:58.898
Not people like you two,
but other people.

01:58.932 --> 02:00.700
What people?
We haven't told anyone.

02:00.734 --> 02:02.803
Actually,
some of us have.

02:03.939 --> 02:05.506
Adrian told you?

02:05.541 --> 02:06.875
I don't disclose
my sources.

02:06.909 --> 02:10.478
Just one of the reasons
people are comfortable
talking to me.

02:10.513 --> 02:12.680
And it doesn't
matter who told me.

02:12.715 --> 02:15.817
I heard it
from someone
other than you,

02:15.851 --> 02:17.719
and that doesn't
make me too happy.

02:17.753 --> 02:19.554
And let me
tell you something,

02:19.588 --> 02:20.855
your father isn't very
happy about this either.

02:20.889 --> 02:22.857
In fact, he was
gonna come with us,

02:22.891 --> 02:24.825
but he had a surgery
to perform this morning.

02:24.860 --> 02:27.828
You're not married to him,
she's married to him.
Shouldn't she me that?

02:27.863 --> 02:29.530
I'm telling you that.

02:29.564 --> 02:30.931
Has Ollie weighed in on this?

02:30.965 --> 02:33.567
How's your girlfriend
or fiancee or
whatever she is...

02:33.602 --> 02:34.669
How does she
feel about it?

02:34.703 --> 02:35.837
I haven't mentioned
this to Ollie.

02:35.871 --> 02:37.707
I don't know how
she's going feel about it.

02:37.741 --> 02:39.609
I don't care
how she feels about it.

02:39.643 --> 02:41.812
And as much as
I love you both
and my dad,

02:41.846 --> 02:43.615
I don't care how
you feel about it either

02:43.649 --> 02:46.618
because this is what
we want to do, so this
what we're doing.

02:46.652 --> 02:48.988
Uh... I care.
I care what you think.

02:49.022 --> 02:51.624
I also care
what my dad thinks

02:51.658 --> 02:54.695
and he's not too happy
about it either,

02:54.729 --> 02:56.764
and I feel terrible
about that, but...

02:57.699 --> 02:58.966
I really love being here.

02:59.001 --> 03:03.939
I mean, I love Ricky
and we both love John

03:03.974 --> 03:06.910
and we both love you...

03:06.945 --> 03:08.979
And we both have to
get to school.

03:09.848 --> 03:10.848
Bye.

03:11.917 --> 03:13.785
Say "bye," John.
Bye-bye.

03:13.820 --> 03:16.555
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
Bye, John.

03:17.957 --> 03:19.925
Bye.
JOHN: Bye-bye.

03:25.766 --> 03:27.000
He's so cute.

03:28.002 --> 03:29.636
He is.

03:29.671 --> 03:30.738
Ricky.

03:30.772 --> 03:32.706
John.
But Ricky's cute too.

03:32.741 --> 03:36.644
Oh! And you know,
you're right, Amy does
look like you.

03:36.679 --> 03:38.880
I know.
It's kind of sick, isn't it?

03:38.914 --> 03:40.648
Oh, a little.

03:41.016 --> 03:43.518
So, what do you think?

03:43.552 --> 03:45.586
I think I hope
Ricky doesn't mess this up.

03:45.621 --> 03:47.789
Ricky? Hope Ricky
doesn't mess it up?
What about Amy?

03:47.823 --> 03:49.624
Oh, Amy's not going
to mess this up.

03:49.658 --> 03:51.959
No. Unless, of course,
at some point she
wants a real commitment.

03:51.994 --> 03:54.763
At which point,
it could all fall apart.

03:54.797 --> 03:56.932
Well, after they've
lived together for a while,

03:56.966 --> 03:59.902
maybe they'll want
to make a commitment
to each other.

03:59.937 --> 04:03.473
I mean, I don't think
this is the worst idea.

04:03.507 --> 04:05.475
I wish I had
known, but...

04:05.509 --> 04:06.909
Maybe this is
the right thing for them.

04:06.944 --> 04:10.580
You know Ricky has issues.
Especially with commitment.

04:11.882 --> 04:14.884
I don't know
if he can be
with just one girl.

04:14.919 --> 04:17.620
I think Ricky can
make a commitment.

04:17.654 --> 04:20.524
I think what he's doing
here is a commitment.

04:21.625 --> 04:24.661
Seems to me
you're the one that is...

04:24.696 --> 04:27.664
I told you I do not
want to talk about that.

04:27.699 --> 04:29.733
...unable to make
a commitment.

04:29.767 --> 04:31.901
I don't know why
you can't just work
something out

04:31.936 --> 04:33.570
so that Ollie is...

04:33.604 --> 04:34.904
Not going to talk about it.

04:34.938 --> 04:36.672
She loves you.

04:37.774 --> 04:39.842
(SIGHS) All right.

04:40.778 --> 04:41.978
I got to go.

04:42.012 --> 04:44.780
Oh, when you see
Ricky this afternoon,

04:44.815 --> 04:47.583
don't give him any
ideas about Amy
wanting a commitment,

04:47.617 --> 04:49.952
because maybe she does
and maybe she doesn't.

04:49.986 --> 04:51.787
Just let that be
between the two of them

04:51.821 --> 04:55.590
and don't let your
own issues cross
over into their lives.

04:55.625 --> 04:56.792
Or what?

04:56.826 --> 04:59.661
Or this little arrangement
he has with Amy

04:59.695 --> 05:01.530
could be the
beginning of the end

05:01.564 --> 05:04.599
instead of the beginning
of the beginning.

05:06.869 --> 05:07.869
Bye, Mom.

05:54.991 --> 05:55.991
Hi.

05:56.226 --> 05:57.293
Hi.

05:57.327 --> 05:59.996
Katelyn O'Malley.
Okay.

06:00.030 --> 06:02.098
I'm the school counselor.

06:02.132 --> 06:05.268
Oh. I'm sorry.
I thought you
were a student.

06:05.302 --> 06:08.171
Excuse me.
Leo Boykewich,
nice to meet you.

06:09.340 --> 06:10.373
Could I talk to you?

06:10.408 --> 06:12.976
I only have a few minutes.
In my office?

06:18.382 --> 06:20.951
Please, sit down.

06:20.985 --> 06:23.220
I don't really
have time to

06:24.055 --> 06:25.156
sit down.

06:26.291 --> 06:28.092
I'm a little concerned
about Ben.

06:28.126 --> 06:30.261
We've all been a little
concerned about Ben.

06:30.295 --> 06:32.930
But he's doing all right
in school, isn't he?

06:32.964 --> 06:34.998
He is, he's making
a real effort

06:35.033 --> 06:36.266
to make up for
the time he lost.

06:36.300 --> 06:38.135
Good, good to hear.

06:38.169 --> 06:41.271
He's done really well,
considering what he
and Adrian went through,

06:41.305 --> 06:43.306
but it just seems
that he's

06:44.208 --> 06:45.342
increasingly

06:46.344 --> 06:47.378
agitated.

06:47.412 --> 06:49.380
Considering what
happened to them,

06:49.414 --> 06:52.116
it seems normal
he'd be agitated,
don't you think, Katelyn?

06:52.151 --> 06:54.051
I suppose so, yes.

06:54.086 --> 06:56.354
But he's getting more
and more agitated.

06:56.389 --> 06:59.324
Kind of building up steam
like he might,

06:59.358 --> 07:02.894
I don't know,
lose control or something.

07:02.929 --> 07:05.296
I just wondered
if there's anything
I can do.

07:05.331 --> 07:07.065
No, I don't think so.

07:07.099 --> 07:09.334
He's been getting
some help.

07:09.368 --> 07:11.302
And that's confidential
between you and me.

07:11.336 --> 07:14.272
Of course.
And that's good to hear.

07:14.306 --> 07:17.908
So, is Adrian also
getting some help?

07:17.943 --> 07:21.112
Because I would
love to get her back in
school by end of the year.

07:21.146 --> 07:23.280
I mean, if she came
back now and she
went to summer school,

07:23.314 --> 07:25.182
she might still
be able to graduate
this summer.

07:25.216 --> 07:26.950
I can't really
answer for Adrian.

07:26.985 --> 07:29.053
You'll have to ask Adrian
or her parents.

07:29.087 --> 07:30.188
Or Ben even.

07:30.222 --> 07:32.023
I talked to Ben,
he told me to call her,

07:32.058 --> 07:33.925
but she won't return
any of my phone calls.

07:33.960 --> 07:35.227
And I don't want
to just show up.

07:35.262 --> 07:36.395
You might have to.

07:36.429 --> 07:38.130
My wife, Betty,
did that last week.

07:38.165 --> 07:41.034
She went over there
and talked to her,

07:41.068 --> 07:43.270
and I think
she made Adrian
feel a little better.

07:43.304 --> 07:47.407
So you want to
show up, show up.
It's up to you.

07:47.442 --> 07:51.078
I've never been one
to just show up
somewhere myself,

07:51.112 --> 07:56.050
but sometimes maybe
it's the only thing to do.

07:59.153 --> 08:00.253
Hey, there he is.

08:00.288 --> 08:02.055
Yeah. Here I am.

08:02.089 --> 08:04.891
Could we use
your office for a
moment? You mind?

08:04.925 --> 08:06.125
I...

08:06.160 --> 08:07.960
I guess not.

08:08.929 --> 08:10.163
Hi, Ben.

08:14.302 --> 08:16.137
What are you
doing here?

08:16.171 --> 08:18.272
I thought I'd come by
and see if you wanted to
get out for the day.

08:18.306 --> 08:20.341
It's Friday,
the end of week.

08:20.376 --> 08:22.911
Maybe you wanted
to take the rest of
the day off, like me.

08:22.945 --> 08:24.980
No. I don't want
to take the day off.

08:25.015 --> 08:26.348
I don't want to get out
for the rest of the day.

08:26.382 --> 08:28.150
I can't get out for
the rest of the day.

08:28.184 --> 08:30.118
I've already missed
a lot of school and
I'm still catching up.

08:30.153 --> 08:32.354
Your counselor just
told me that you were
pretty much caught up.

08:32.388 --> 08:34.155
I just thought
we could hang out.

08:34.190 --> 08:36.124
I'm not caught up.

08:36.159 --> 08:39.061
You want out
of your office so badly
that you'd come over here

08:39.095 --> 08:41.297
and try to get me out
of class so you'd have
someone to hang out with?

08:41.331 --> 08:43.999
It's just that
I can't go through
another weekend

08:44.034 --> 08:45.167
without asking you something.

08:45.201 --> 08:46.969
Something you couldn't
just call me about?

08:47.003 --> 08:48.103
I called you.

08:48.138 --> 08:49.371
I didn't get any messages
that called me.

08:49.406 --> 08:51.240
Well, I didn't want
to leave a message.
What?

08:51.274 --> 08:54.109
I never know who
you're around
when I call.

08:54.144 --> 08:56.979
Most of the time
you're at your condo
and Adrian's there,

08:57.013 --> 08:59.181
and at the shop,
Bunny's there, and Ricky.

08:59.215 --> 09:00.983
So next time
just text me.

09:01.017 --> 09:02.251
No one's reading
my text messages,

09:02.285 --> 09:04.019
and I erase them
as soon as I get them.

09:04.054 --> 09:05.955
It's good to know. Still,

09:05.989 --> 09:08.257
I don't want any record
of anything regarding this.

09:08.291 --> 09:09.892
Regarding what?

09:09.927 --> 09:10.960
You know what.

09:13.164 --> 09:15.064
Camille?

09:15.099 --> 09:17.300
You still want to talk
about Camille?

09:17.334 --> 09:19.902
Did you come all the way
over here to my high school

09:19.937 --> 09:23.039
and drag me out of class
to find out if a girl
really likes you?

09:23.073 --> 09:27.978
I can't get
our conversation
out of my mind.

09:28.012 --> 09:31.382
I mean, are you sure
about this theory
regarding Camille?

09:31.416 --> 09:33.284
Dad, I just rushed
through a test

09:33.318 --> 09:35.353
and lied to my teacher
and told her I wasn't
feeling well

09:35.387 --> 09:37.155
so I could come out
here and talk to you.

09:37.189 --> 09:39.024
And I don't even think
she believes me,

09:39.058 --> 09:40.325
but no one is saying
no to me right now

09:40.360 --> 09:42.261
because everyone feels
so sorry for me.

09:42.295 --> 09:46.065
And because they think
you're increasingly agitated.

09:46.099 --> 09:47.133
(STAMMERS)

09:49.036 --> 09:50.403
I thought
you weren't coming in
until tomorrow.

09:50.437 --> 09:52.038
Why didn't you call me?

09:56.010 --> 09:57.210
I can't wait
to see you.

09:57.244 --> 09:58.278
I'll leave right now,
I'll come over there.

09:58.312 --> 10:00.347
Oh. I'm not home.
I wanted to see Adrian.

10:00.381 --> 10:02.949
Okay, well, when
are you leaving there?

10:02.984 --> 10:06.352
I don't know, but...
It's my first day back,
so it's been a little crazy.

10:06.386 --> 10:09.322
Still, you want
to see me, right?
It's been two weeks.

10:09.356 --> 10:12.158
I know,
a long two weeks,

10:12.192 --> 10:15.128
but I'm just
completely jet-lagged,

10:15.162 --> 10:17.096
so when I leave here,
I'll probably just
go home and crash.

10:17.130 --> 10:18.197
I'll crash with you.

10:18.231 --> 10:20.199
Grant, I want
to see you, I do,

10:20.233 --> 10:23.001
but I just need a day, okay?

10:23.035 --> 10:25.336
I just need to go
home and sleep
and clean up

10:25.371 --> 10:27.205
and I need to
see my mom.

10:27.240 --> 10:28.407
So let's just see
each other tomorrow.

10:28.441 --> 10:30.376
You said
there was nothing
we could do about it!

10:30.410 --> 10:32.278
We! That includes you.

10:32.312 --> 10:34.046
And by the way,
do you think doing nothing

10:34.081 --> 10:37.384
is not just going to make me
increasingly agitated?

10:37.418 --> 10:40.087
Look, I couldn't
do anything about
losing Mercy,

10:40.121 --> 10:41.388
but I can do something
about losing me.

10:48.096 --> 10:50.097
You told him
I said that?

10:51.299 --> 10:53.434
I didn't say it was you,
no, course not.

10:54.503 --> 10:56.270
But he may be right.

11:01.209 --> 11:03.110
Grace, I don't want
to wait till tomorrow
to see you.

11:03.145 --> 11:05.179
Well, I wasn't
going to be back
until tomorrow anyway.

11:05.213 --> 11:07.948
Yeah, when were you
going to let me know
you got in early?

11:07.983 --> 11:09.083
If Jack hadn't
said anything,

11:09.117 --> 11:10.250
I wouldn't even know
that you're back.

11:10.285 --> 11:12.186
Well, I am,

11:12.221 --> 11:13.321
and tomorrow night,
when you had planned
to see me,

11:13.355 --> 11:15.289
you will see me, okay?

11:15.324 --> 11:16.457
I have to go,
I'm at Adrian's.

11:18.093 --> 11:19.160
I'll talk to you
later, okay?

11:23.098 --> 11:24.232
He hung up on me.

11:24.266 --> 11:26.133
Finally.

11:26.168 --> 11:29.370
I mean, I feel badly,
but I really wanted
to see you first.

11:32.074 --> 11:33.374
Here I am.
Here you are.

11:34.276 --> 11:35.442
Yeah.

11:37.412 --> 11:40.247
Thanks for
coming over, Grace,

11:40.282 --> 11:42.316
but it's hard
for me to see you

11:42.350 --> 11:45.053
or to see anyone
when I look this.

11:45.087 --> 11:46.421
When you look like what?
Fat.

11:46.455 --> 11:48.457
Adrian, you just...

11:48.491 --> 11:50.091
Yeah,

11:50.126 --> 11:52.094
I just had a baby.

11:52.128 --> 11:53.262
Sorry.

11:54.164 --> 11:55.365
In a weird way,

11:56.500 --> 11:59.135
I like being fat.

11:59.169 --> 12:01.104
It makes me feel
like I'm still pregnant.

12:02.273 --> 12:03.373
I loved being pregnant.

12:03.408 --> 12:05.275
I know.

12:05.310 --> 12:07.010
And again,
I'm so sorry...

12:07.045 --> 12:08.412
You don't have
to keep saying
you're sorry.

12:08.446 --> 12:11.248
I just...
I feel helpless
to help you,

12:11.282 --> 12:13.150
and I can see that
you're still hurting.

12:13.185 --> 12:15.018
I don't want any help!

12:15.053 --> 12:16.086
Don't help!

12:17.321 --> 12:19.189
I don't want people
feeling sorry for me.

12:19.223 --> 12:22.025
I can't stand being pitied.

12:22.059 --> 12:25.094
And I don't want
to talk about
the baby, Grace.

12:25.128 --> 12:28.096
It's really hard for me
and it honestly doesn't
seem to

12:28.131 --> 12:29.365
do me any good
to talk about it.

12:29.399 --> 12:31.434
Okay. Let's talk
about something else,
anything else.

12:33.003 --> 12:34.404
It's really great
to see you.

12:34.438 --> 12:36.339
I missed you.

12:36.373 --> 12:38.374
I missed being able
to talk to you
anytime I wanted,

12:38.409 --> 12:41.011
anytime I needed.

12:41.045 --> 12:44.180
I mean, that's what's
so great about having
a best friend, right?

12:44.215 --> 12:45.448
You can tell your
best friend anything.

12:45.483 --> 12:48.184
Would you stop?

12:48.219 --> 12:50.053
I don't need to talk
about what happened.

12:50.088 --> 12:53.323
I totally understand
what you're saying about that.

12:53.358 --> 12:55.426
But maybe
I need to talk to you.

12:57.429 --> 12:59.130
Really.

12:59.164 --> 13:01.932
I can tell you things
I would never tell
anyone else.

13:01.967 --> 13:03.400
What can you tell me
that you can't tell
anyone else?

13:05.203 --> 13:07.037
About my trip to Zimbabwe.

13:07.072 --> 13:08.105
What about it?

13:08.139 --> 13:10.174
Well...

13:10.208 --> 13:12.075
It was an
amazing experience.

13:12.110 --> 13:14.044
You know, Jeff really
let me do a lot.

13:14.078 --> 13:15.412
He let me
watch him operate

13:15.446 --> 13:17.948
and I got to hold the...

13:17.982 --> 13:19.016
The babies?

13:21.353 --> 13:27.258
It's not like people
can stop saying
the word "baby" or "babies."

13:27.292 --> 13:29.994
I'm just going to have
to get used to it.

13:30.028 --> 13:35.099
So, get back
to what you were saying
about the babies.

13:35.134 --> 13:37.235
That's just what the
volunteers mostly do.

13:38.170 --> 13:40.304
Hold the little patients.

13:40.339 --> 13:42.039
You can tell anyone that.

13:42.074 --> 13:43.274
Yeah, I know.

13:43.308 --> 13:45.976
Get to the part that
you can only tell me.

13:46.011 --> 13:47.344
Is there a part
that you can only tell me

13:47.379 --> 13:49.313
or were you just
trying to make me feel
special or something

13:49.347 --> 13:50.381
to make me feel better?

13:51.450 --> 13:53.417
You can't make me feel
better, all right?

13:53.452 --> 13:55.319
So don't do that.

13:55.354 --> 13:58.356
Just be honest,
say what you're thinking.

13:58.391 --> 14:00.258
Geez, I wish more people
could be like Betty.

14:01.194 --> 14:02.995
I...

14:03.029 --> 14:04.330
I am like Betty.

14:05.232 --> 14:06.966
The old Betty.

14:25.185 --> 14:28.253
If all the guys
look like that over there,
I might volunteer.

14:28.287 --> 14:31.056
He's not from over there,
he's from over here.

14:31.091 --> 14:32.291
He's from California.

14:32.325 --> 14:34.059
He was over there
with his dad.

14:34.094 --> 14:35.194
His dad was one
of the doctors.

14:38.998 --> 14:41.100
Wait... You and this guy...

14:41.134 --> 14:42.168
Yep.

14:42.202 --> 14:43.336
(EXCLAIMING)

14:43.370 --> 14:45.304
I didn't mean
for it to happen,

14:47.140 --> 14:48.308
but I'm really
happy that it did.

14:48.342 --> 14:50.076
(LAUGHING)

14:59.464 --> 15:00.498
Why not Bunny?

15:00.532 --> 15:01.665
Because she's Bunny.

15:01.700 --> 15:04.301
Yeah. She is Bunny.

15:04.335 --> 15:06.669
She knows
everything there is to
know about the business

15:06.704 --> 15:08.705
and she knows Leo.
Who better than Bunny?

15:08.739 --> 15:10.640
Probably anyone.
Even you.

15:10.675 --> 15:11.708
Oh?

15:11.742 --> 15:13.543
I didn't mean that
like it sounded.

15:13.578 --> 15:15.679
How did you mean it?
I meant it in a good way.

15:15.713 --> 15:18.515
I meant, he could
have asked you.
I guess.

15:18.549 --> 15:21.585
Yeah, I guess,
but who wants it?

15:21.619 --> 15:24.321
I'm happy right here,
right now, you know.

15:24.355 --> 15:27.324
I'm sober, I have
a safe place to live,

15:27.359 --> 15:29.360
I have an honest job.

15:29.394 --> 15:31.362
I have my son
back in my life

15:31.396 --> 15:34.366
and my grandson and...

15:34.400 --> 15:36.668
What do I call Amy
now that you two
are living together?

15:36.703 --> 15:38.604
Amy.
Oh. Okay.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.539
Don't forget about Ollie.
You've got Ollie.

15:40.574 --> 15:41.574
What do I call Ollie?

15:44.379 --> 15:45.545
(SIGHS)

15:46.614 --> 15:47.814
We broke up,

15:47.848 --> 15:49.516
like a few weeks ago.

15:50.618 --> 15:53.587
What happened?
I'll tell you what happened.

15:53.621 --> 15:55.522
I couldn't make
a commitment either,

15:55.556 --> 15:57.423
not real commitment.

15:57.458 --> 16:01.661
She wanted a wedding
and a marriage

16:01.695 --> 16:04.631
and she wanted
to invite friends
and family and I

16:05.666 --> 16:07.500
didn't.

16:07.535 --> 16:08.668
Wait, "either"?
What do you mean
by "either"?

16:08.703 --> 16:11.371
Oh, so you're going
to marry Amy someday?

16:11.405 --> 16:12.772
I don't think
we want to get married.

16:12.807 --> 16:14.507
We like things
just like they are.

16:14.542 --> 16:18.712
You've been living together
for like what, a week now?

16:18.746 --> 16:21.348
You think Amy is going
to be happy with
just living together?

16:21.382 --> 16:23.550
Don't kid yourself.

16:23.584 --> 16:26.586
And don't tell Margaret
I said anything
about this, okay?

16:27.422 --> 16:29.589
(DOOR CLOSING)

16:29.623 --> 16:31.624
Hey, Mr. Petersen!
How are you?

16:38.432 --> 16:39.599
What's going on?

16:39.633 --> 16:41.768
Nothing.
Bunny's filling in
at your dad's office.

16:41.802 --> 16:43.503
Oh, geez.

16:43.537 --> 16:45.571
No wonder he's out
running loose today.
He didn't mention that.

16:45.606 --> 16:47.740
What happened
to his assistant?

16:47.775 --> 16:49.375
Who knows?

16:49.410 --> 16:50.743
You know.
Wouldn't you know?

16:50.778 --> 16:52.611
How would I know?
I know you know something

16:52.646 --> 16:54.547
'cause you're answering
questions with questions.

16:54.581 --> 16:58.351
Maybe she got tired
of working for him
after 25 years.

16:58.386 --> 17:00.654
I mean, think about it.
About 25 years.

17:00.688 --> 17:02.489
That's 300 months.

17:02.523 --> 17:05.325
That's thousands of weeks.

17:05.359 --> 17:06.626
1,300.

17:06.661 --> 17:07.761
How many days?

17:07.795 --> 17:11.598
365 times 25,
plus six for leap year...

17:11.632 --> 17:13.733
How many?
9,131.

17:13.767 --> 17:17.636
Can you imagine
spending 9,131 days
with anyone?

17:17.671 --> 17:20.472
I can't. Can you?

17:20.507 --> 17:21.773
I can't even stand
to think about it.

17:21.808 --> 17:25.377
It's like staring
into a giant black hole
in the universe

17:25.412 --> 17:27.313
and watching
your entire life
get sucked through it

17:27.347 --> 17:28.780
before you can
even grab on to it
for the ride.

17:28.815 --> 17:31.650
Maybe you're thinking
a little too much, you know?

17:31.685 --> 17:33.486
Just don't think about it.

17:37.758 --> 17:39.592
I can't quit
thinking about it.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.427
You'll see.
Once you start
thinking about it,

17:41.461 --> 17:44.363
about the hours
and the days and the
months and the years

17:44.398 --> 17:45.765
you're going
to spend with Amy,
things will change.

17:45.799 --> 17:48.367
And not for the better.
I don't care how
happy you are.

17:49.803 --> 17:51.704
I want out.
I don't care if you know,

17:51.738 --> 17:53.572
I don't care
if everyone knows,
I want out.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.341
Do you care
if Adrian knows?

17:55.375 --> 17:57.443
Stop saying that
out loud or someone
is going to tell her.

17:57.478 --> 17:59.578
Maybe it's better that way.
Because I can't.

17:59.613 --> 18:00.679
I can't tell her
I want to go.

18:00.714 --> 18:03.650
And I can't stay.
It's killing me.

18:03.684 --> 18:06.285
You tell her.
You know her best,
or you think you do.

18:06.319 --> 18:07.353
You tell her.

18:07.387 --> 18:08.420
I don't even talk to her.

18:08.455 --> 18:10.489
If and when
I do talk to her,

18:10.523 --> 18:12.424
it's not going to be
to tell her that you
want out of your marriage.

18:12.458 --> 18:13.758
Geez, she just
lost a baby.

18:13.793 --> 18:17.461
So did I.

18:26.503 --> 18:30.439
Wow. That's a little change
from the apron, huh?

18:30.474 --> 18:31.574
You look nice, Bunny.

18:31.608 --> 18:33.509
You look very, um,
professional.

18:35.712 --> 18:37.313
What's your problem?

18:37.347 --> 18:39.614
Mr. Petersen is just
waiting on his steaks.

18:39.649 --> 18:40.782
Here you go.

18:40.817 --> 18:43.518
Tell Teresa I already put
the marinade on,

18:43.553 --> 18:45.587
she doesn't have
to do a thing,
just throw them on the grill.

18:45.621 --> 18:47.456
Thanks, sweetheart.
Bunny.

18:49.626 --> 18:52.528
I prefer dead cows
to people any day.

18:53.664 --> 18:55.565
So, is Leo okay?

18:55.599 --> 18:59.435
No, he is not okay.
He is short-tempered
and cranky.

19:00.571 --> 19:02.338
But,

19:02.373 --> 19:06.576
for the exception
of Camille, I guess,
everybody understands.

19:06.610 --> 19:07.744
Understands what?

19:07.778 --> 19:09.712
That you all had
a rough year.

19:09.747 --> 19:13.717
And right now
your dad is a sensitive guy
with a short temper

19:13.751 --> 19:15.686
but a big heart.

19:15.720 --> 19:18.622
Yeah, a big heart
and yet not big enough.

19:18.656 --> 19:19.689
We have that in common.

19:30.634 --> 19:32.368
(SIGHING)

19:38.775 --> 19:40.809
Leo, what are
you doing here?

19:42.812 --> 19:46.414
I'm here to ask you
if you could please
come back to work.

19:46.448 --> 19:48.316
I took another job.
I start Monday.

19:48.350 --> 19:49.650
Come on, Camille.
Don't go to a new job.

19:49.684 --> 19:51.585
It's not too late for you
to change your mind.

19:51.620 --> 19:54.389
I'm afraid it is, Leo.
It is too late.

19:55.491 --> 19:57.658
Thanks for coming by,

19:57.693 --> 20:00.595
but let's not make this
any harder on me than
it already has been.

20:00.630 --> 20:03.732
Well, if it's so difficult,
why did you leave?

20:03.767 --> 20:06.402
Why not?
Why not?

20:06.436 --> 20:09.705
Because you're important
to the company.

20:10.674 --> 20:12.508
The company needs you.

20:13.811 --> 20:15.545
Okay, I need you.

20:15.580 --> 20:17.414
Please. Come back.

20:17.782 --> 20:19.550
No.

20:19.584 --> 20:20.751
Sorry, Leo,
I've made up my mind.

20:20.786 --> 20:22.587
I don't want to be there.

20:22.621 --> 20:23.655
I don't want
to work for you.

20:23.689 --> 20:24.723
To be blunt.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.791
To be honest.
Is that honest?

20:26.825 --> 20:28.392
That's as honest
as I can get.

20:28.427 --> 20:30.561
Why don't you want
to work for me
all of a sudden?

20:31.396 --> 20:32.463
I just don't.

20:32.497 --> 20:33.564
There has to be a reason.

20:33.598 --> 20:35.498
No, there doesn't.
There's no reason?

20:36.433 --> 20:37.667
(SIGHS)

20:37.701 --> 20:40.469
I think you know
the reason, Leo.
I think I don't.

20:40.503 --> 20:41.670
You want to take a guess?

20:41.705 --> 20:42.771
No.

20:42.805 --> 20:44.639
But you know
I'd like to come back,

20:44.673 --> 20:46.441
so if you go
to the new job

20:46.475 --> 20:48.443
and you don't like it
and you change your mind...

20:48.477 --> 20:50.478
I won't, and going back
to what you just said,

20:50.512 --> 20:51.746
I don't know
how you feel.

20:54.817 --> 20:56.417
All right.

20:56.451 --> 20:58.553
Well, I feel that

20:59.688 --> 21:02.457
people make
mistakes sometimes,

21:02.491 --> 21:05.660
and then, unfortunately,
they have to live with
those mistakes

21:06.695 --> 21:08.362
and make the best of it.

21:08.397 --> 21:10.398
Yes. Even you.

21:10.432 --> 21:12.400
I just said that.
You said "people."

21:12.834 --> 21:15.336
You know I meant me.

21:15.370 --> 21:16.604
I guess what
I'm saying is

21:16.638 --> 21:19.340
I can't live
with your mistakes.

21:19.374 --> 21:21.475
And I don't want to be
a part of your "making
the best of it,"

21:21.510 --> 21:23.344
whatever that means.

21:23.378 --> 21:25.379
So, thank you
for dropping by,

21:26.715 --> 21:27.781
but don't drop by again.

21:31.520 --> 21:33.554
All right.

21:33.588 --> 21:36.424
I won't drop by again
and I'll stop asking you
to come back to work.

21:39.495 --> 21:41.563
So I guess this is it.

21:42.465 --> 21:43.599
This is it.

21:43.633 --> 21:45.701
You always did have
to have the last word.

22:16.119 --> 22:17.953
See for yourself.

22:18.889 --> 22:20.056
(LAUGHING)

22:21.759 --> 22:24.061
Hi, John. Hi.

22:24.095 --> 22:26.764
Hi. I hope you don't
mind if we drop by.

22:26.798 --> 22:28.932
I stopped by the bakery
to pick up some things
for dinner

22:28.966 --> 22:31.968
and I thought
I'd drop off a cake
for you guys.

22:32.003 --> 22:33.903
That is so sweet.

22:33.938 --> 22:35.071
Yeah. Would you
like to sit down?

22:35.106 --> 22:38.709
Oh, no, we can't stay.
I'm cooking spaghetti tonight.

22:38.743 --> 22:39.877
I didn't know you cook.

22:39.911 --> 22:42.012
Well, Ricky does
most of the cooking.

22:42.047 --> 22:44.982
I don't know how
to cook very many things
other than spaghetti, huh?

22:49.755 --> 22:53.957
So, this is a little
more awkward than
I thought it might be.

22:53.992 --> 22:58.696
Look, I just feel really
badly that you don't like
that I'm living with Ricky.

22:58.730 --> 23:00.831
Or that John and I
are living with Ricky.

23:00.866 --> 23:03.668
And I know he says
he doesn't care,
but he does care.

23:03.702 --> 23:04.736
We both do.

23:04.770 --> 23:06.837
Oh, no, honey.

23:06.872 --> 23:10.007
I don't think it's the worst
thing that the two of you
are living together.

23:10.041 --> 23:15.846
No, we don't approve
but we don't not approve.

23:15.880 --> 23:17.781
It may work out,
it may not.

23:17.815 --> 23:20.884
I just didn't like
hearing about it
from somebody else.

23:20.918 --> 23:22.819
But we're over that now.

23:22.853 --> 23:23.920
Are you?

23:23.954 --> 23:26.022
Amy, we've all just
got to stay focused

23:26.056 --> 23:30.059
on what is best
for this little man
right there.

23:30.094 --> 23:32.662
And if you and Ricky
can work things out

23:32.696 --> 23:34.630
so that you can raise
your son together,

23:34.665 --> 23:35.965
I'm all for it.

23:35.999 --> 23:39.768
And I'm all for Ricky
having a, uh...

23:39.803 --> 23:41.904
Stable, loving relationship.

23:41.938 --> 23:44.006
Even if you're not married.

23:44.040 --> 23:46.942
Amy, are you okay
with not being married?

23:46.976 --> 23:49.911
With living with Ricky
without any kind
of commitment?

23:49.946 --> 23:53.081
Shakur, that's a little
personal, don't you think?

23:54.049 --> 23:55.950
Sorry.

23:55.984 --> 23:59.920
But as long as
the question is
out there, are you?

23:59.954 --> 24:01.655
I really am.

24:02.657 --> 24:03.823
I am.

24:03.858 --> 24:06.760
I think that being married
can make Ricky feel trapped.

24:06.794 --> 24:09.596
And I think being married
is a good thing
for a lot of people,

24:09.631 --> 24:11.599
but I don't think
it would be a good
thing for Ricky and me.

24:11.633 --> 24:12.734
You know what?

24:12.768 --> 24:15.703
You are a smart cookie.

24:15.738 --> 24:17.906
I like you, Amy,
I really do.

24:17.941 --> 24:20.676
And I'm glad that
you stopped by here.

24:20.710 --> 24:22.845
You're always welcome here.

24:22.880 --> 24:26.749
And it's nice to see
you and John in my kitchen,
feels like family.

24:26.783 --> 24:28.083
Thanks.

24:28.118 --> 24:29.785
No French fries.

24:31.988 --> 24:33.655
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

24:35.925 --> 24:37.859
Hey, Ash, how's the road?
Good.

24:37.894 --> 24:39.962
That's great.
Where are you now,
the middle of Texas?

24:39.996 --> 24:41.696
You must be around
the middle of Texas.

24:41.731 --> 24:43.631
Are you to
San Antonio yet?

24:43.666 --> 24:44.766
You've got to stop
and visit the Alamo.
It's amazing.

24:44.800 --> 24:47.668
We're kind of past
San Antonio.

24:47.703 --> 24:50.772
Yeah, well, turn
around and go back.
Believe me, it's worth it.

24:50.806 --> 24:54.009
Well, we're not
just past San Antonio.
We're way past it.

24:54.043 --> 24:55.777
You can't be
way past it yet.

24:55.812 --> 24:57.646
Last time
you called me,
you were in El Paso.

24:57.680 --> 24:59.582
Yeah, but we just had
a couple of cappuccinos
and kept driving.

24:59.616 --> 25:01.017
Where are you?
We're here.

25:01.051 --> 25:02.618
<i>You're where?</i>

25:02.653 --> 25:03.686
In Florida.

25:03.721 --> 25:04.754
You can't be
in Florida already.

25:04.788 --> 25:05.989
Oh, I can,
because I am.

25:06.023 --> 25:07.624
What?

25:07.658 --> 25:08.858
We're at the
house already.

25:08.892 --> 25:10.926
Toby's grandmother's house.
It's nice.

25:10.961 --> 25:12.662
But you just left,
like, yesterday.

25:12.696 --> 25:13.929
We left a week ago.

25:13.964 --> 25:15.965
So you're there with
Toby's grandmother?

25:15.999 --> 25:19.835
Uh, we're at
Toby's grandmother's
house, yeah.

25:19.869 --> 25:20.902
With his grandmother?

25:20.937 --> 25:22.837
Uh...

25:22.872 --> 25:25.039
No.
But she's coming.

25:25.074 --> 25:26.907
We got here
a couple of weeks early

25:26.942 --> 25:28.843
and she's
still in New York,
but she's coming.

25:28.877 --> 25:31.679
All right, Ashley.
Well, I'm happy
you made it.

25:31.713 --> 25:33.981
And there's a lot
you can learn in Florida.
A lot of history there.

25:35.750 --> 25:37.684
I miss you.
Yeah, I miss you,
too, Dad.

25:38.119 --> 25:40.688
And, um...

25:40.722 --> 25:43.057
Thanks for
letting me do this.

25:43.091 --> 25:44.959
It really is
kind of fun.

25:47.062 --> 25:48.796
I love you.
Good night.

25:48.830 --> 25:50.097
Good night, Ashley.

25:54.736 --> 25:55.836
Pass the ketchup.

25:56.939 --> 25:58.039
(KNOCKING)

26:07.049 --> 26:08.650
Hey, I was hoping
you'd be here.

26:08.685 --> 26:09.785
Yeah, I'm here.

26:09.819 --> 26:11.587
I haven't
seen you in a while,

26:11.621 --> 26:12.888
so I thought
I'd drop by
and say hello.

26:12.922 --> 26:14.022
Your mothers tell you
to come and talk to me?

26:14.056 --> 26:15.657
No.

26:15.691 --> 26:16.758
You're the one
who told them?

26:16.792 --> 26:17.825
They didn't tell you
I told them?

26:17.860 --> 26:19.694
No.
Tell them what?

26:19.728 --> 26:21.629
You told them
Amy and I are
living together.

26:21.663 --> 26:22.763
The whole thing
is ridiculous.

26:22.797 --> 26:23.864
You're not old enough to
have your own apartment,

26:23.898 --> 26:25.031
much less
your own family.

26:25.066 --> 26:26.600
Yeah, maybe,

26:26.634 --> 26:27.868
but we do have
our own apartment

26:27.902 --> 26:30.671
and our own family,
and that's how it is.

26:30.705 --> 26:31.872
That place is too small
to raise your son

26:31.906 --> 26:33.740
in that tiny apartment
with him right next to you.

26:33.775 --> 26:36.710
People live
in tinier apartments
with more than one kid.

26:36.744 --> 26:38.612
I hope you're
not here to tell me
you're having another kid.

26:38.646 --> 26:41.014
No, no, I'm not.
I'm just here because

26:41.049 --> 26:43.650
you're Amy's dad
and I want to be on
good terms with you

26:43.684 --> 26:44.952
and the rest
of the family.

26:44.986 --> 26:46.786
And I'd like you
to come over and
visit us sometime,

26:46.821 --> 26:48.622
and I know
Amy would like that.

26:48.656 --> 26:49.990
I'm not going to do that,
so you don't have to
worry about that.

26:50.024 --> 26:53.060
I'm not
worried about that.
Why wouldn't you?

26:53.094 --> 26:55.094
'Cause I don't want
to see where you're
sleeping with my daughter.

26:55.129 --> 26:56.863
You've seen
my apartment before.

26:56.897 --> 26:58.831
Not with the
two of you in it.
The three of us.

26:58.866 --> 27:00.700
And the three of us
are really happy there.

27:00.734 --> 27:02.835
Yeah? Well,
sooner or later the
honeymoon is going to be over

27:02.870 --> 27:04.904
and then we'll see
how happy the
three of you are.

27:04.939 --> 27:07.040
I guess there's
a honeymoon period
with all relationships,

27:07.074 --> 27:08.909
whether you're married
or just living together.

27:08.943 --> 27:10.577
That's what the
marriage is for.

27:10.612 --> 27:11.945
That's why you make
a legally binding commitment.

27:11.979 --> 27:13.881
To keep you together
after the honeymoon is over.

27:13.915 --> 27:16.016
To keep you together
long after you want
to be there.

27:16.050 --> 27:18.719
If there comes a time
when Amy doesn't
want to be there,

27:18.754 --> 27:19.754
she can just walk away.

27:19.789 --> 27:21.056
And so can you.
That's why this whole

27:21.090 --> 27:22.757
living-together thing
doesn't work.

27:22.792 --> 27:24.893
It works for us.
For right now.

27:24.927 --> 27:27.762
You crazy teenagers
think that that's
what life is all about.

27:27.797 --> 27:29.764
The right now.

27:29.798 --> 27:31.966
I think that's what
Buddhists think life is
all about. The right now.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.802
So now
you're a communist?
What?

27:33.836 --> 27:36.771
No. I'm not
a communist or a Buddhist

27:36.805 --> 27:37.939
or anything but
in love with Amy.

27:37.973 --> 27:39.607
Why can't I just
be in love with Amy?

27:39.641 --> 27:40.675
Because that's not enough.

27:40.709 --> 27:42.610
It is for Amy.
It's not for me.

27:42.644 --> 27:44.879
All right, well,
Amy wanted you
to come over

27:44.913 --> 27:47.682
and have dinner with us.
She's making spaghetti.

27:47.716 --> 27:48.850
She makes the worst
spaghetti in the world.

27:48.885 --> 27:50.686
(CHUCKLES) I know.

27:50.720 --> 27:51.987
It doesn't even
have real meat in it.
I know.

27:52.022 --> 27:53.723
You want to eat
meatless spaghetti
the rest of your life?

27:53.757 --> 27:56.626
We could bring
Moose with us.

27:56.660 --> 27:58.962
She just wants to feel
like what we're doing
is okay with you.

27:58.997 --> 28:01.665
She doesn't have to
have your approval,
but she wants it.

28:01.699 --> 28:03.734
Actually, she does
need my approval.

28:03.769 --> 28:05.570
You're 18, she's not.

28:05.604 --> 28:06.971
If I want to stop
the two of you
from living together,

28:07.005 --> 28:08.005
legally, I could.

28:08.040 --> 28:09.807
But you're not
going to, are you?

28:10.609 --> 28:11.742
No, I'm not.

28:11.776 --> 28:12.810
She loves you.

28:12.844 --> 28:15.613
She loves you more.
Yeah.

28:15.647 --> 28:16.981
But isn't that the way
life's supposed to be?

28:17.015 --> 28:18.783
No.
Come on.

28:18.817 --> 28:20.751
Tell you what,
I'll have dinner over there

28:20.786 --> 28:22.687
when you put
a ring on her finger,

28:22.721 --> 28:24.889
and I don't even want
to see that happen until
she's graduated from college.

28:24.923 --> 28:26.891
That's a really,
really long time.

28:26.925 --> 28:28.793
Yeah. So is the
rest of your life.

28:37.701 --> 28:39.035
I honestly think
it's good for Ashley

28:39.069 --> 28:40.737
to go off
on this adventure,

28:40.772 --> 28:42.072
to get away from
her house for a while.

28:42.106 --> 28:43.841
Yeah, well, look
where that got me.

28:43.875 --> 28:45.877
Telling Grace to go off
on her adventure.

28:45.912 --> 28:47.679
She doesn't even
want to see me
her first night home.

28:47.714 --> 28:49.681
Yeah, I know.

28:49.715 --> 28:51.750
I'd feel that way
if Peter went off

28:51.784 --> 28:53.952
and didn't call me
when he got back,

28:53.986 --> 28:55.920
but of course,
Ashley's not my girlfriend,

28:55.955 --> 28:58.023
she's just a friend,
a good friend.

28:58.057 --> 28:59.124
Your best friend.

28:59.159 --> 29:00.993
She was my best friend.

29:01.027 --> 29:03.996
But hey, I've got
a new best friend.

29:04.031 --> 29:05.832
Who's that?
Peter.

29:05.866 --> 29:07.800
He's not your best friend,
he's your boyfriend.

29:07.834 --> 29:09.902
Yeah, that too.

29:09.936 --> 29:11.070
Oh, here he is.

29:16.110 --> 29:17.811
Sorry I'm late.

29:20.982 --> 29:23.151
Griffin didn't tell you
I was coming, did he?

29:23.185 --> 29:24.719
I don't care.

29:24.753 --> 29:26.087
I assumed he was
bringing Grace

29:26.122 --> 29:28.156
since you said
she was back.

29:28.190 --> 29:30.926
So where is Grace?
She wanted to
see her family.

29:30.960 --> 29:32.761
I mean, that's
understandable, right?

29:32.795 --> 29:34.195
She did just
get back in last night.

29:34.230 --> 29:35.230
Right.
Right.

29:37.967 --> 29:39.167
I don't know,

29:39.201 --> 29:40.968
but if Griffin went away
for a couple of weeks

29:41.003 --> 29:42.970
and on his
first night back
he didn't see me,

29:43.004 --> 29:45.906
I think I'd be accusing
someone of cheating.

29:45.940 --> 29:49.876
Ooh. Whoa!
We're talking
about Grace here.

29:49.910 --> 29:52.746
And I would never
cheat on you.

29:52.780 --> 29:53.847
Grace would never
cheat on me.

29:53.881 --> 29:55.182
And I would never
cheat on her.

29:55.216 --> 29:56.917
You think
she cheated on me?

29:56.952 --> 29:58.953
She's on a medical mission.
Who would she cheat with?

30:01.023 --> 30:02.123
Yummy.

30:02.158 --> 30:04.025
Is Jack eating with us
or is it just the two of us?

30:04.060 --> 30:07.062
Oh, let's see,
it's the four,
five, seven of us.

30:07.096 --> 30:09.865
Tom and Rachel
and the kids and Jack?

30:09.899 --> 30:11.066
Yes. And Jack.

30:11.101 --> 30:13.101
So, can you set
the dining room
table, please?

30:13.136 --> 30:16.237
Okay, I think
I'm just gonna
eat in my room, in bed.

30:16.271 --> 30:18.005
I'm so jet-lagged.

30:18.040 --> 30:19.874
I don't think
I could stay awake
through a meal.

30:19.908 --> 30:21.842
Oh. Well, you should have
slept in this morning.

30:22.277 --> 30:23.977
I needed to see Adrian.

30:24.011 --> 30:26.012
You could have
seen her tomorrow.

30:26.046 --> 30:27.980
I'm surprised
you didn't need
to see Grant.

30:28.015 --> 30:29.114
He's not coming
over tonight?

30:29.149 --> 30:31.016
No, I'm too tired
to see Grant.

30:31.051 --> 30:32.918
Really, can't I just
take a plate of food
upstairs and eat?

30:32.953 --> 30:34.186
Honey, no.
You need to get back

30:34.221 --> 30:35.922
on your normal schedule
as soon as possible.

30:35.956 --> 30:38.191
I mean, you have to be
back at school
on Monday. Okay?

30:38.225 --> 30:40.727
So, why don't you just
eat with all of us,

30:40.762 --> 30:42.763
stay awake
as long as you can,

30:42.797 --> 30:44.732
and then go to bed,
and then wake up
at your usual time tomorrow?

30:44.767 --> 30:46.834
I'll try, but I don't know,
I don't know if
I'm going to make it.

30:46.869 --> 30:47.869
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)

30:50.874 --> 30:51.974
It's Grant.

30:52.008 --> 30:53.208
Oh, well, tell him
he's welcome

30:53.242 --> 30:55.744
to come over and
eat with the rest of us.

30:55.778 --> 30:57.011
Although, I prefer
the two of you not spend
the night together.

30:57.046 --> 30:58.246
You know,
just take it one night...

30:59.849 --> 31:02.116
Grace, what's going on?

31:02.150 --> 31:04.251
Nothing.
I just told Grant
I'd see him tomorrow.

31:05.987 --> 31:07.220
I just don't feel comfortable
with having him here

31:07.255 --> 31:09.155
when Jack's
in the next room.

31:09.190 --> 31:10.990
Which is probably
the real reason

31:11.025 --> 31:12.859
you let that woman
and her two children
move into the guest house

31:12.893 --> 31:14.794
and you put Jack
right next door to me.

31:14.828 --> 31:15.929
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)

31:15.963 --> 31:18.131
So, who are you texting?

31:18.165 --> 31:20.966
It's not Grant.
I can tell it's not Grant.

31:21.001 --> 31:22.168
No, you can't.

31:22.202 --> 31:24.136
Is it that guy
you met on your trip?

31:24.170 --> 31:27.840
What? What guy
did I meet on my trip?

31:27.874 --> 31:30.209
Mom, please.
I did not meet
a guy on my trip.

31:32.246 --> 31:34.881
Jeff sends pictures,
you know.

31:34.915 --> 31:36.716
Jeff can send
all the pictures he wants,

31:36.750 --> 31:38.084
it doesn't mean
I met somebody.

31:38.119 --> 31:43.090
I mean, I met people,
but not any special
guy kind of people.

31:44.092 --> 31:45.793
Who's that?

31:46.128 --> 31:49.030
Oh. That guy? I

31:49.065 --> 31:50.765
resuscitated him.

31:50.799 --> 31:51.933
(LAUGHS)

31:51.967 --> 31:53.101
Standing up?

31:53.135 --> 31:55.970
Yeah, that's how they
like to do it over there.

31:56.004 --> 31:59.739
You know, it's better
for the lungs to be upright.

31:59.774 --> 32:01.808
Honey,
Jeff already told me.

32:01.842 --> 32:02.909
That I slept with that guy?

32:03.210 --> 32:04.811
You did what?

32:04.845 --> 32:06.846
Okay, don't get upset.
Please don't get upset.

32:06.880 --> 32:08.815
I'm already upset enough.
I don't know what
I was thinking.

32:08.849 --> 32:11.918
Grace, this is why
you don't have sex
in high school.

32:11.952 --> 32:16.022
Well, this is why you do.

32:16.057 --> 32:19.827
Grace! You can't just sleep
with every guy you meet.

32:19.862 --> 32:21.763
This is going to be
the last one.

32:21.797 --> 32:23.765
Honey, you said that
Jack was going to be
the only one

32:23.799 --> 32:25.067
for the rest of your life.

32:25.101 --> 32:27.069
And I know
you believed it,
even though I didn't.

32:27.103 --> 32:29.906
And then Grant,
you said you were
in love with Grant.

32:29.940 --> 32:33.175
I am! Or I was. I love him.

32:33.210 --> 32:34.977
I never said Grant was
going be the last one.

32:36.146 --> 32:38.181
I think I'm in love
with Daniel, Mom.

32:38.215 --> 32:41.017
And not in the same way
I was in love with Jack.
Or Grant.

32:41.051 --> 32:42.785
And the way
you're in love with Daniel

32:42.819 --> 32:44.753
is not the way
you're gonna be
in love with the next guy,

32:44.787 --> 32:45.987
or the next guy after that.

32:46.022 --> 32:47.022
Probably not.

32:47.056 --> 32:48.056
Probably not?

32:48.091 --> 32:50.091
Ugh, Grace, I was just
trying to make a point.

32:50.126 --> 32:51.159
Well, can you hurry up
and make it?

32:51.194 --> 32:53.194
Because he's
on his way over here.

32:54.864 --> 32:55.897
JACK: Who's on his way
over here?

32:56.765 --> 32:57.865
Oh, God.

32:57.899 --> 32:59.099
I'm sorry,
but I live here.

32:59.133 --> 33:01.935
I couldn't help
but hear you
coming down the stairs.

33:01.970 --> 33:03.804
New boyfriend, huh?

33:03.838 --> 33:05.205
If you say a word
to Madison or to your
new friend Grant,

33:05.239 --> 33:07.741
or to anybody, anybody,
I will...

33:07.776 --> 33:08.943
Grace, stop.

33:08.977 --> 33:11.078
I'm not going to say
anything to anyone.

33:11.112 --> 33:13.947
But I can't wait to meet him.
So, you cheated, huh?

33:13.981 --> 33:15.048
Hmm.

33:15.082 --> 33:16.917
See, it's easier
than you thought, isn't it?

33:16.951 --> 33:19.219
I used to be like that.
But then I met someone
I really love.

33:19.253 --> 33:21.821
(SCOFFS) You'd cheat
with me if I let you.

33:21.856 --> 33:23.055
Actually I wouldn't.

33:23.090 --> 33:24.123
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

33:29.896 --> 33:30.897
Hmm.

33:32.833 --> 33:35.135
Okay, I am just
gonna go eat
in the guest house

33:35.169 --> 33:37.804
with Tom and Rachel
and the kids,
and so will you.

33:37.838 --> 33:39.139
Don't you want
to meet this guy,
see if you like him?

33:39.173 --> 33:41.742
Oh, I like him.
I mean, I like you,

33:41.776 --> 33:43.177
I like Grant,
I liked Ricky and Ben.

33:43.211 --> 33:45.913
I've liked all the guys
Grace has been out with.

33:45.948 --> 33:47.015
But I think
she's gonna be going out

33:47.049 --> 33:48.917
with a lot more guys
after this.

33:48.951 --> 33:52.053
So, I just wish
she would stop having sex
until she's a little older

33:52.087 --> 33:54.089
and ready to make
a commitment. And you too.

33:54.123 --> 33:55.924
I'm not having sex.

33:55.958 --> 33:57.958
Well, as Grace pointed out,
how long is that gonna last?

34:04.799 --> 34:06.766
I hope not much longer.

Hi. Uh, is Grace home?

34:23.819 --> 34:24.886
Are you Jack?

34:24.920 --> 34:25.920
Are you Daniel?

34:31.882 --> 34:33.916
nner.

34:33.951 --> 34:36.786
He was asked
to be at the family dinner,
he's living with the family.

34:36.820 --> 34:38.922
That doesn't mean
he's cheating on you
with Grace.

34:38.956 --> 34:40.690
Well, it's her
first night home

34:40.724 --> 34:42.692
and it's the first time
he's ever broken a date
with me.

34:42.726 --> 34:46.062
It's step one
to cheating. It's step one
to him breaking up with me.

34:46.097 --> 34:48.699
Well, I say
let go and let God.

34:48.733 --> 34:50.033
If you really want
to know if he loves you,

34:50.068 --> 34:52.068
set him free and see
if he comes back to you.

34:52.103 --> 34:55.039
Oh, like Jesse or...
What was that other guy?

34:55.072 --> 34:56.907
Yeah. Like that.

34:56.942 --> 34:58.075
Yeah, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

34:58.110 --> 34:59.877
If I didn't have
a boyfriend, too.

34:59.911 --> 35:02.780
I'd love that.
I'm sick of Jack.

and have some fun.

I want to go to the mall
and hang out at some hangout.

I want to meet some new guys
and have some new experiences.

something that I feel that
Jack is never gonna tell you.

Should you do that?
No, you shouldn't.

35:39.719 --> 35:41.820
Lauren's with Madison.
Hi, Lauren.

35:41.854 --> 35:44.056
Jack is having a bit
of an emotional breakdown.

35:44.090 --> 35:45.857
I just talked to him.

35:45.892 --> 35:47.859
He sounded okay to me,
happy even.

35:47.894 --> 35:50.729
He would never
tell you this,

35:50.763 --> 35:53.065
but Jack really doesn't want
to go to Arizona to school.

35:53.099 --> 35:57.036
He really
wants you guys to move back
and to take your old job back.

he just wants to
live with you guys

for this last year.

move back.

in so much trouble.

to wake up.

Nice to meet you.
What happened to Grace?

36:53.097 --> 36:56.065
You know, that's
a very good question.

36:56.100 --> 36:58.801
Maybe she fell apart
when our church fell apart.

36:58.835 --> 37:01.837
You know, one minister
after another, one guy...

37:03.039 --> 37:05.007
Ah, never mind.

37:05.041 --> 37:07.744
I don't know
if you know this or not, but
Grace used to be a Christian.

37:07.778 --> 37:09.078
So what?
I'm a Christian.

37:09.113 --> 37:10.913
Me, too.
I've never even been to church

37:10.948 --> 37:13.049
and I'm betting I'm
the only Christian here.

37:21.091 --> 37:22.925
I have to talk to Grant.

37:27.064 --> 37:28.865
I'll call you tomorrow?

37:31.936 --> 37:34.070
I'll probably see you later,
'cause I'll be right upstairs.

37:38.975 --> 37:40.909
Hi. Good night.

37:42.911 --> 37:44.078
Grant,

37:45.814 --> 37:48.882
I'm really sorry,
but I...

37:51.853 --> 37:54.054
I met somebody else.
Obviously.

37:54.088 --> 37:56.690
I'm really sorry.

37:56.725 --> 37:57.724
Me, too.

37:59.827 --> 38:02.028
But hey, things happen, and

38:04.065 --> 38:05.866
I hope we can be
friends, Grace.

38:05.900 --> 38:08.836
You do?

38:08.870 --> 38:13.841
Okay, that's not
what I was expecting,
but that's so nice.

38:16.044 --> 38:18.746
Wait a minute. That's
a little bit too nice.

38:19.915 --> 38:22.016
What'd you do?
Good night, Grace.

I've been waiting for you.

38:52.080 --> 38:54.013
I need to talk to you.
I need to talk to you.

38:56.984 --> 38:58.852
I know what
you're going to say, Ben.

38:58.886 --> 39:01.021
No.

39:01.055 --> 39:03.857
No, I don't think you do know
what I'm going to say.

39:03.891 --> 39:06.726
Okay, maybe I don't,

39:09.063 --> 39:12.032
but here's what I want
to say to you.

39:16.037 --> 39:20.040
I don't blame you if you
want to run away from home.

39:22.077 --> 39:25.779
I don't blame you if
you can't take this anymore,

39:25.814 --> 39:28.749
if you don't
want to be with me.

39:28.783 --> 39:32.820
I've been
horrible these past
two months, really horrible.

39:34.022 --> 39:36.724
I've just been so hurt, Ben.

39:37.993 --> 39:42.964
Losing Mercy
hurt me more than
I knew I could be hurt.

39:42.998 --> 39:46.902
And a tough girl like me
doesn't know how to be hurt.

39:48.737 --> 39:51.005
I stopped allowing myself
to be hurt years ago.

39:53.775 --> 39:55.710
But this,

39:55.744 --> 39:58.012
what happened to us,

39:58.047 --> 40:01.816
that went
right through that wall
that I always put up,

40:01.851 --> 40:04.820
and it crushed me.

40:04.854 --> 40:07.823
And I've been trying
to pick up the pieces,

40:07.858 --> 40:10.059
but there are just
so many pieces,

40:10.093 --> 40:15.063
it was overwhelming
and terrifying and
just exhausting.

40:17.099 --> 40:19.968
But I don't want
to lose you, Ben.

40:20.936 --> 40:22.871
I really don't.

40:22.905 --> 40:24.939
I love you
more than you know.

40:26.041 --> 40:29.811
And I'm just asking
for some time,

40:31.113 --> 40:34.048
just a little more
of your time.

40:36.785 --> 40:38.053
Stay with me.

40:40.756 --> 40:41.990
Be with me.

40:43.058 --> 40:44.725
Heal me, Ben.

40:48.897 --> 40:50.030
I can't.

40:52.033 --> 40:53.767
I can't heal you.

40:55.771 --> 40:56.938
I can't stay with you.

40:57.873 --> 40:59.006
I can't be with you.

40:59.040 --> 41:01.976
I'm sorry. I can't.

41:04.946 --> 41:06.980
Of course you can.

41:08.949 --> 41:11.083
And I'll make it all worth it.

41:21.096 --> 41:22.963
Was that a maybe?

41:37.781 --> 41:39.983
I just feel so healthy
when we eat like that.

41:40.017 --> 41:42.953
With the whole wheat pasta
and that sauce.

41:42.988 --> 41:46.858
When we eat like that,
then I feel like
we can have a dessert

41:46.892 --> 41:47.892
like this.

41:50.997 --> 41:51.996
Thanks.

41:52.932 --> 41:54.799
Yeah, that sauce.

41:54.833 --> 41:55.967
What's in that
sauce exactly?

41:56.001 --> 41:57.669
It's a meat substitute.

41:57.703 --> 41:59.871
It's made from vegetables
and soy products.

41:59.905 --> 42:01.005
I don't know how to
cook with those things.

42:01.040 --> 42:03.675
I'll have to learn to
cook healthier.

42:03.709 --> 42:06.978
Well, maybe I could
cook that once a week.

42:07.012 --> 42:09.780
We could make every
Friday night spaghetti night.

42:21.059 --> 42:23.060
Trying to
get the taste of that
sauce out of your mouth?

42:23.095 --> 42:24.996
Dad, stop teasing me.

42:25.030 --> 42:27.799
I know
you like my spaghetti.
You had a huge plateful.

42:27.833 --> 42:30.068
Amy wants to make every
Friday night spaghetti night.

42:30.102 --> 42:31.936
Maybe you can come over
every Friday night.

42:31.970 --> 42:34.673
I'll take Thursdays.
(SCOFFS)

42:34.707 --> 42:36.808
I'll see you two.
Thanks for coming over.

42:37.743 --> 42:38.877
Good night.

42:42.915 --> 42:44.049
Good night.
Good night.
