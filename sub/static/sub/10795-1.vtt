03:49.600 --> 03:51.990
You don't need his approval, you just want it.

03:52.160 --> 03:54.038
What's the difference?

03:54.200 --> 03:57.238
Well, most of what we call needs are desires.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.392
We need air to breathe...

04:00.240 --> 04:02.118
water, warmth, food to eat.

04:02.280 --> 04:04.158
Speaking of which...

04:04.320 --> 04:07.233
But the rest - love, approval, recognition...

04:07.400 --> 04:09.676
praise, whatever- they're desires.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.718
<i>So what's sex?</i>

04:11.880 --> 04:13.872
<i>Is that a need or a desire?</i>

04:14.960 --> 04:17.031
Well, both, if you're doing it right.

04:42.560 --> 04:44.233
<i>But don't you want children?</i>

04:44.400 --> 04:47.711
- Of course I do.
- Then you <i>do</i> want marriage in the end.

04:47.880 --> 04:49.951
I didn't know you were so conventional.

04:52.120 --> 04:55.557
There's a province somewhere in China where the Mosuo people live.

04:56.440 --> 05:00.354
The head of the family is a mother or grandmother who controls the family's finances.

05:00.520 --> 05:04.036
Marriage doesn't exist. Instead, they practise walking marriage.

05:04.200 --> 05:08.035
A woman can invite a man into her hut to spend a sweet night.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.678
But he has to be gone by daybreak.

05:10.840 --> 05:12.832
I'm up for that.

05:13.480 --> 05:18.157
The Mosuo language has no words for "war", "murder" or "rape" and there are no jails.

05:18.320 --> 05:19.754
Think about it.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.912
I'd be out of a job.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.753
- Hm, as would I.

05:23.920 --> 05:25.400
I have to take this.

05:39.400 --> 05:42.472
<i>We don't want this to turn into an international custody battle.</i>

05:42.640 --> 05:46.031
We have to consider the emotional wellbeing of your children.

05:46.200 --> 05:48.874
<i>I want them back ASAP. This is unacceptable.</i>

05:49.040 --> 05:51.839
<i>- What the hell am I paying you for?</i>
- I will go into the office...

05:52.000 --> 05:55.038
<i>tomorrow, we can talk it through then.</i>

05:55.720 --> 05:57.598
<i>I will ring you first thing.</i>

05:57.760 --> 05:59.752
<i>- You'd better.
- OK, bye.</i>

06:04.280 --> 06:06.158
I should go.

06:06.320 --> 06:09.279
- It's Friday night.
- Seems I have work to do.

06:34.840 --> 06:36.991
What are you doing? I just got you a drink.

06:37.160 --> 06:40.392
I've had two already. That's my limit. Three and I'm anyone's.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.040
That's the plan.

06:42.200 --> 06:44.192
I know, that's why I'm going home.

08:20.520 --> 08:23.194
I'm calling the police. If you're still here, you should go.

08:23.360 --> 08:25.352
I'm calling the police.

08:38.960 --> 08:40.519
Police officers!

08:42.240 --> 08:44.232
We're entering with weapons drawn.

08:45.040 --> 08:48.716
If anyone is in the house, make your presence known immediately.

08:58.200 --> 09:01.193
Alpha Papa 10 to Uniform, checking the rear area now.

09:38.640 --> 09:40.313
Police officer.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.352
- It's OK, there's no one here.
- OK.

10:06.680 --> 10:08.080
Daddy?

10:08.520 --> 10:10.512
Where have you been?

10:16.480 --> 10:18.358
What are you doing out of bed?

10:18.520 --> 10:21.240
I was frightened. I woke up and you weren't here.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.876
I just popped out, just to the all-night shop.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.235
Why?

10:25.400 --> 10:26.959
To get some headache pills.

10:27.120 --> 10:31.433
We have headache pills. Mummy keeps them up in the bathroom.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.114
I've just been five minutes.

10:33.280 --> 10:35.158
No, you haven't, you've been ages.

10:35.320 --> 10:36.595
I called your phone.

10:36.760 --> 10:38.752
I didn't take it with me.

10:39.920 --> 10:41.593
Come here.

10:49.480 --> 10:51.358
What's in your bag?

10:51.520 --> 10:53.398
It's just some stuff from the shop.

10:53.560 --> 10:57.395
I tried to ring Mummy but I got her number wrong.

11:00.760 --> 11:02.240
I'm sorry.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.676
I promise I won't go and leave you again, OK?

11:04.840 --> 11:06.832
Cross my heart and hope to die.

11:07.480 --> 11:09.551
Only don't tell Mummy, she'll be cross.

11:09.720 --> 11:11.359
With me?

11:11.520 --> 11:13.512
No, no, with me.

11:16.960 --> 11:18.440
Kiss Mac.

11:27.840 --> 11:30.036
- Is this your underwear?
- Yes.

11:34.120 --> 11:35.520
Oh, my God.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.198
Is that yours too?

11:38.360 --> 11:39.840
Yes.

11:40.880 --> 11:44.191
And you didn't just leave these things on the bed yourself?

11:45.520 --> 11:47.000
No, I...

11:48.720 --> 11:50.040
No.

11:50.680 --> 11:52.751
Where've you been this evening, Sarah?

11:53.480 --> 11:55.836
Out with some colleagues in the city centre.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.640
- And what do you do for a living?
- I'm a solicitor.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.280
And you've been drinking?

12:00.920 --> 12:02.320
Just some wine.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.472
How much wine, Sarah?

12:55.760 --> 12:57.752
No sign of forced entry.

12:58.640 --> 13:00.518
Who else has keys to the house?

13:00.680 --> 13:02.558
My sister, she has keys.

13:02.720 --> 13:04.677
She wouldn't have done this as a joke?

13:04.840 --> 13:06.194
What? No.

13:06.360 --> 13:08.238
No boyfriend who has keys?

13:08.400 --> 13:09.720
No.

13:10.760 --> 13:12.752
An ex could have kept keys?

13:13.520 --> 13:16.274
Um...I don't know.

13:17.280 --> 13:19.158
- I see you have a cat.
- Yeah.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.960
The cat couldn't have... I dunno, been on the bed?

13:24.400 --> 13:26.710
Have you checked the loft? Can you check the loft?

13:30.680 --> 13:32.399
Is anything missing?

13:34.200 --> 13:36.192
Where was the underwear kept?

13:36.760 --> 13:39.559
The underwear... was here in these top two drawers.

13:39.720 --> 13:42.599
The other thing was in the bedside cabinet drawer.

13:47.240 --> 13:48.720
I think...

13:49.520 --> 13:51.512
maybe some underwear's gone.

14:09.160 --> 14:11.038
<i>Loft is clear.</i>

14:17.360 --> 14:19.795
- It's a client.
- Isn't it rather late for that?

14:19.960 --> 14:21.235
Yep, it is.

14:21.400 --> 14:23.392
I think maybe you should just go.

14:24.240 --> 14:26.277
I have to be up in the morning to deal with this.

14:28.280 --> 14:31.352
I really appreciate you coming but I need to sleep.

14:32.680 --> 14:35.957
If you're worried, you should stay with a family member or friend.

14:36.120 --> 14:38.077
Er...yeah, I'll call my sister.

14:38.240 --> 14:41.039
- Just make sure you don't drive anywhere.
- I won't.

14:41.200 --> 14:43.920
If you're not sure who might still have keys, change the locks.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.878
I will, thank you.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.312
Sorry, I just want to go to bed.

14:52.840 --> 14:56.390
We've checked the premises and surrounding area. No intruder located.

14:56.560 --> 15:00.713
We've given assurances we'll pay passing attention throughout the night.

15:00.880 --> 15:02.394
What?

15:02.560 --> 15:04.438
Could it have been the cat?

15:04.600 --> 15:06.239
She's drunk.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.915
That's her excuse. What's yours?

15:35.360 --> 15:37.352
You could have warmed my side for me.

15:39.520 --> 15:41.512
Why would I do that?

15:42.240 --> 15:44.232
You horrible man.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.231
That'd be Detective Superintendent Gibson?

16:30.400 --> 16:32.471
- Yes, ma'am.
- Then that would be me.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.155
Stella.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.952
Nice to see you.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.438
Armoured car, Jim.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.592
Welcome to Belfast.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.072
He's a good man, very experienced.

16:58.400 --> 17:02.872
First and foremost, we want to progress the investigation. We don't want a trial by audit.

17:03.040 --> 17:06.431
I've done 28-day reviews before...sir.

17:06.599 --> 17:09.273
Not here, you haven't. Things are different here.

17:09.440 --> 17:12.717
What, all that "My Jesus is better than your Jesus" stuff?

17:13.599 --> 17:15.637
Policing is political here, Stella.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.791
And it isn't at the Met?

17:18.800 --> 17:22.156
The victim's ex-father-in-law is a Unionist MP.

17:22.319 --> 17:27.111
Morgan Monroe, Unionist MP, ex-lawyer, chair of the Independent Policing Executive.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.237
I haven't walked in here totally unprepared.

17:29.400 --> 17:30.959
Good.

17:33.640 --> 17:35.632
We have nothing, Stella.

17:37.480 --> 17:40.871
The killer is out there somewhere and we have nothing at all.

18:49.080 --> 18:51.197
This is Detective Superintendent Gibson.

18:51.840 --> 18:55.151
She's seen your file so I'll let you make your own introductions.

18:55.320 --> 18:57.198
Garrett Brink. Pleased to meet you.

18:57.360 --> 18:59.033
Is there anything you need?

18:59.200 --> 19:01.999
- Oh, is that coffee?
- It's actually hard to tell.

19:03.480 --> 19:05.039
I'll risk a cup.

19:07.240 --> 19:09.118
I'll have your case taken to your hotel.

19:09.280 --> 19:11.272
Thank you, sir.

19:22.520 --> 19:24.512
It's been three months.

19:25.720 --> 19:27.996
And I haven't even stepped into his room.

19:32.080 --> 19:35.391
The can of Coke he had the day before is still sitting there.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.916
You know, at first I thought it was a virus.

19:41.080 --> 19:43.072
You've told him before.

19:44.680 --> 19:46.672
I gave him paracetamol.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.713
By the time they put him on antibiotics, it was too late.

19:51.880 --> 19:53.951
The boy told the doctors he felt better.

19:54.120 --> 19:56.794
He'd have said anything to be allowed to go home.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.114
Are you eating?

20:05.440 --> 20:07.079
Not really.

20:08.760 --> 20:10.433
How are things in the bedroom?

20:24.480 --> 20:26.472
Before they took him away,

20:27.600 --> 20:29.592
I painted his hands and his feet.

20:33.520 --> 20:35.512
And made prints.

20:40.680 --> 20:43.195
Three other people are living because of him.

20:45.360 --> 20:49.320
A little boy regained his sight because of our Daniel.

20:52.240 --> 20:53.879
That's something.

20:57.680 --> 20:59.672
It's almost like he's still living.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.399
Somewhere...

21:02.560 --> 21:04.552
his heart is beating.

21:07.200 --> 21:09.192
- Come in.

21:11.440 --> 21:14.239
Er...Jerry McElroy. You asked to see me.

21:14.400 --> 21:16.392
Come in, Jerry.

21:17.320 --> 21:19.960
- I'm Detective Superintendent Gibson.
- Ma'am.

21:20.120 --> 21:22.112
This is DCI Brink, who I think you know.

21:22.280 --> 21:24.272
Jerry and I go way back.

21:25.040 --> 21:26.394
Have a seat.

21:28.240 --> 21:31.074
I've been brought in from the Metropolitan Police to lead a review

21:31.240 --> 21:34.233
into the investigation of the murder of Alice Monroe.

21:34.400 --> 21:36.278
Yes, ma'am.

21:36.440 --> 21:39.592
As the senior investigating officer on that case, Jerry,

21:39.760 --> 21:43.720
we want to work closely with you to advance the investigation, if we can,

21:43.880 --> 21:45.712
not to find fault.

21:46.360 --> 21:49.558
If any problems are identified through review,

21:49.880 --> 21:54.432
you will be notified immediately so that remedial action can be taken if possible.

21:54.600 --> 21:56.193
I see.

21:56.360 --> 22:00.673
I will be looking at the investigative response, the initial actions at the scene,

22:00.840 --> 22:03.719
information gathering, witness and suspect management,

22:03.880 --> 22:06.475
forensic issues, exhibit management and submission.

22:06.640 --> 22:10.031
And I'm going to be looking at record keeping, document management,

22:10.200 --> 22:15.594
action administration, communications - internally and externally - with the victim's family.

22:15.760 --> 22:20.357
We will, in time, read all documentation relating to the enquiry.

22:21.440 --> 22:25.559
And to that end, I will need your policy book and your action book.

22:26.040 --> 22:28.032
I have them here.

22:30.200 --> 22:31.634
Any questions?

22:34.760 --> 22:36.752
I feel so alone.

22:43.720 --> 22:45.598
Have you anything to say, Jimmy?

22:45.760 --> 22:47.274
Of course he doesn't.

22:47.440 --> 22:49.318
Sitting there...

22:49.480 --> 22:50.914
the hard man.

22:53.160 --> 22:55.356
Useless waste of space.

22:59.440 --> 23:02.035
Men and women express grief differently, Liz.

23:03.560 --> 23:05.552
Try not to make comparisons.

23:09.320 --> 23:11.516
How long am I gonna feel like this, Paul?

23:27.240 --> 23:29.118
<i>Doors closing.</i>

23:29.280 --> 23:32.478
How things are in the bedroom's none of your fucking business.

23:32.640 --> 23:34.916
Sorry if you're uncomfortable with the question.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.549
Uncomfortable doesn't even begin to cover it.

23:37.720 --> 23:42.397
My wife says it comforts her to think of our dead son giving life to others.

23:43.640 --> 23:45.518
And how does it make you feel?

23:45.680 --> 23:49.560
How does it make me feel? His heart beating in some taig's chest?

23:49.720 --> 23:51.712
It makes me feel sick.

23:52.360 --> 23:54.352
I've done things...

23:55.440 --> 23:57.432
bad things, in the past.

23:58.160 --> 23:59.719
Really bad things.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.472
And my son has paid the price.

24:04.800 --> 24:07.190
Your son had bacterial meningitis, Jimmy.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.872
An illness. That's all.

24:14.520 --> 24:18.275
You don't believe a son has to pay for the sins of his father?

24:20.160 --> 24:21.719
No, I don't.

24:22.920 --> 24:24.593
Don't you believe in God?

24:25.800 --> 24:27.075
Jimmy, let me go.

24:27.240 --> 24:28.879
Answer me.

24:31.040 --> 24:33.032
Of course I believe in God.

24:34.120 --> 24:35.793
In Jesus Christ too.

24:35.960 --> 24:39.590
I have seen angels ascending and descending Jacob's Ladder.

24:40.840 --> 24:42.832
Is that what you want to hear?

24:43.880 --> 24:45.872
It makes no odds what I believe, Jimmy.

24:46.040 --> 24:48.032
It's what you believe that matters.

24:50.760 --> 24:52.353
Let me go.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.151
What kind of name is Spector, anyway?

25:00.880 --> 25:02.872
It's Russian...Jewish.

25:04.560 --> 25:06.552
That explains a lot.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.198
Daddy, look what I've found.

26:46.360 --> 26:49.512
Where'd you get that? You're not supposed to pick things.

26:49.680 --> 26:51.672
It was on the floor.

26:52.240 --> 26:54.232
I'm not lying.

26:54.760 --> 26:56.752
Give it to me.

26:58.080 --> 26:59.639
Come on.

27:04.560 --> 27:05.835
Hey.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.878
Hey. You all right?

27:08.040 --> 27:10.032
Shall we sit?

27:16.120 --> 27:18.476
How much do I grow every night?

27:18.920 --> 27:20.991
I don't know - a little bit, probably.

27:21.800 --> 27:25.157
But you know you only grow if you go to sleep straightaway at bedtime

27:25.320 --> 27:27.198
and you stay asleep all night long.

27:27.360 --> 27:29.795
- You should've called me.
- I didn't want to wake you.

27:29.960 --> 27:31.633
I didn't want to wake Lucy.

27:31.800 --> 27:34.713
I'm your sister, for Christ's sake! You should have come over.

27:34.880 --> 27:37.918
I was tired. I'd had a couple of glasses of wine.

27:38.080 --> 27:39.799
Even so.

27:41.600 --> 27:44.069
I've been thinking. Who might still have keys?

27:44.240 --> 27:46.311
Nobody now, I've got the locks changed.

27:46.480 --> 27:48.358
Front, anyway.

27:48.520 --> 27:51.240
The back door needs to be replaced, apparently.

27:53.680 --> 27:58.232
I'm glad I'm eight. It's the oldest I've been in my entire life.

27:59.240 --> 28:02.551
Why don't you stay with us, at least until the back door's done?

28:02.720 --> 28:04.712
I can't, I've too much work to do.

28:05.720 --> 28:07.712
Shall we go? Come on.

28:09.640 --> 28:11.711
Gosh, you're heavy!

28:13.440 --> 28:15.432
Tell me about the three blind mice.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.196
Oh, it's the best smile in the whole world.

28:19.360 --> 28:22.432
<i>There's no evidence of any defensive wounds.</i>

28:24.240 --> 28:29.759
Maybe she was...too fearful or thought cooperation would make things better,

28:29.920 --> 28:33.311
or he overpowered her so she didn't have a chance to fight back.

28:33.480 --> 28:35.073
But whatever...

28:35.240 --> 28:37.550
he had things entirely under his control.

28:40.680 --> 28:43.957
Which leads me to think that this was not his first murder.

28:45.240 --> 28:50.713
The pathologist reports extensive petechial haemorrhages, which suggests that...

28:52.960 --> 28:56.431
..the killer tightened and loosened his grip around her throat

28:56.600 --> 28:59.434
over a period of 45 minutes to an hour.

29:03.680 --> 29:07.037
I was part of a review team, this was actually a seven-day review.

29:07.200 --> 29:10.750
I remember the pathologist on that case making the same observation.

29:10.920 --> 29:12.798
- When was this?
- Three months ago.

29:12.960 --> 29:15.953
It was thought at the time, and still is, as far as I know,

29:16.120 --> 29:18.316
that the killer was known to the victim.

29:19.120 --> 29:21.715
She had, at the time of her death, more than one boyfriend.

29:21.880 --> 29:25.999
Boyfriend one was quickly eliminated, boyfriend two left the country.

29:26.160 --> 29:28.038
Fled, disappeared.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.351
He remains the prime suspect, I believe.

29:30.520 --> 29:32.398
White, professional woman?

29:32.560 --> 29:34.438
A teacher at the university.

29:34.600 --> 29:36.592
In her early 30s?

29:42.360 --> 29:44.033
Posed after death?

29:45.000 --> 29:49.040
Only if you call being stuffed in the bedroom closet posed.

29:57.400 --> 29:59.278
What was her name?

29:59.440 --> 30:01.432
Fiona Gallagher.

30:07.240 --> 30:10.756
The essence to a committed relationship is exclusivity -

30:10.920 --> 30:12.798
physical and emotional.

30:12.960 --> 30:16.032
Anything that impinges on that is cheating and harmful.

30:16.200 --> 30:18.920
Jesus, you should have your own daytime TV show.

30:19.560 --> 30:21.279
What is it, £20 a dance?

30:21.440 --> 30:24.717
That's money you could have spent on your kids or on me, even.

30:24.880 --> 30:27.156
Maybe you shouldn't go through my pockets.

30:27.320 --> 30:29.198
Seven years of marriage.

30:29.360 --> 30:31.317
Seven years of marriage and now this.

30:31.480 --> 30:35.076
Jesus, nothing happens in those places. It's just flirting.

30:35.240 --> 30:38.756
So that's the name you give to somebody pushing their tits in your face?

30:38.920 --> 30:40.593
It is, it's flirting!

30:40.760 --> 30:43.594
The promise of something that will never ever happen.

30:43.760 --> 30:45.752
Only cos no laptop dancer would ever have you.

30:45.920 --> 30:48.435
<i>- Lap</i> dancer.
- What?

30:48.600 --> 30:50.990
Not laptop, <i>lap</i> dancer.

30:52.240 --> 30:54.675
Looking isn't cheating. It's just fantasy.

30:54.840 --> 30:58.516
It's your own fault for getting caught. You should've destroyed the evidence.

30:58.680 --> 31:00.672
- Unhelpful.
- Same again.

31:57.800 --> 31:59.154
Excuse me.

31:59.320 --> 32:01.118
Is this your purse?

32:02.400 --> 32:05.074
- Yeah, it is.
- It was on the floor.

32:05.920 --> 32:08.230
Oh, erm...thank you so much.

32:34.800 --> 32:36.678
Hi. How were they?

32:36.840 --> 32:38.069
Fine.

32:38.240 --> 32:39.959
Did you have a nice evening?

32:40.120 --> 32:42.112
Very nice.

32:43.440 --> 32:45.432
- Four hours?
- Thank you.

32:58.800 --> 33:00.792
Paul'll walk you home.

33:11.440 --> 33:13.432
English, I like.

33:14.280 --> 33:16.158
Art...

33:16.320 --> 33:18.312
I love music.

33:19.960 --> 33:21.838
I'm a singer.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.878
What sort of singer?

33:24.040 --> 33:26.032
I posted a couple of clips online.

33:27.120 --> 33:28.600
Really?

33:28.760 --> 33:30.638
You should take a look.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.678
Maybe I will.

33:32.840 --> 33:34.718
Where can I find you?

33:34.880 --> 33:36.872
Oh, no, I'm not telling you that.

33:38.760 --> 33:41.639
If you wanna see them, you're gonna have to work at it.

33:41.800 --> 33:43.792
Track me down.

33:45.120 --> 33:46.998
I'm worth it.

33:51.040 --> 33:53.600
You look different from when you last baby-sat.

33:53.760 --> 33:55.752
That was months ago.

33:56.640 --> 33:57.915
Yes.

33:58.080 --> 34:00.072
I've had my braces removed.

34:04.640 --> 34:06.632
Thank you for walking me home.

36:00.280 --> 36:02.272
What's the matter with you?

36:02.920 --> 36:04.912
Mm? You been fighting?

36:23.240 --> 36:26.551
- It's OK, Olivia. OK, darling, Mummy's...
- Mummy!

36:38.800 --> 36:40.678
Hush, it's OK.

36:40.840 --> 36:42.559
It's all right.

36:42.720 --> 36:44.598
You've just had a bad dream.

36:44.760 --> 36:47.195
It's OK. It's OK.

36:52.640 --> 36:53.915
Ssh.

36:55.560 --> 36:56.960
Mummy...

36:57.120 --> 36:59.271
Mummy's here. It's all right, come here.

36:59.440 --> 37:01.432
It's all right, it was just a bad dream.

37:01.600 --> 37:03.478
It's OK. Ssh, ssh.

37:03.640 --> 37:05.632
It's OK.

37:06.200 --> 37:08.351
It's all right. That's it. Mummy's here.

37:08.520 --> 37:10.239
Ssh.

37:12.280 --> 37:14.272
It's OK, OK.

37:16.280 --> 37:17.760
Ssh, ssh.

38:01.960 --> 38:03.952
- Ssh.

38:07.920 --> 38:09.912
How is she?

40:07.360 --> 40:09.272
Hey. Are you asleep?

40:09.440 --> 40:10.920
No.

40:12.280 --> 40:14.272
How is she?

40:15.120 --> 40:18.830
Did you tell her that she wouldn't grow if she didn't sleep all night through?

40:20.000 --> 40:22.276
You need to be careful what you say to her.

40:24.640 --> 40:26.632
She's been having nightmares for months.

40:26.800 --> 40:28.519
What I said has nothing to do with it.

40:29.760 --> 40:31.638
She doesn't like being teased,

40:31.800 --> 40:33.792
especially not by her daddy.

40:46.400 --> 40:50.110
I just wish I knew what was going on in her mind when she's like that.

40:52.680 --> 40:55.593
No one knows what's going on in someone else's mind.

40:56.800 --> 40:58.792
Life would be intolerable if we did.

41:54.160 --> 41:56.117
Hope I'm not keeping you from church.

41:56.280 --> 41:58.272
I've already been.

42:15.560 --> 42:18.678
<i>I brought you in to progress the Monroe Investigation.</i>

42:19.000 --> 42:21.959
You need a new and substantial line of inquiry.

42:22.680 --> 42:25.070
And linking these two murders would give you one.

42:26.120 --> 42:30.194
We already have a prime suspect in the Gallagher case, Patrick Warwick.

42:30.840 --> 42:35.631
His brother provided DNA which is a familial match to the DNA gathered at the crime scene.

42:35.800 --> 42:37.678
That doesn't mean it was the killer's DNA.

42:37.840 --> 42:39.877
She was in a relationship with Warwick,

42:40.040 --> 42:42.475
so there's no real surprise his sperm was in her oesophagus.

42:42.640 --> 42:45.792
- If he didn't kill her, then why has he fled?
- I don't know.

42:45.960 --> 42:50.034
There was no sign of forced entry, so it was assumed she knew the killer and let him in.

42:50.200 --> 42:52.157
But I think that assumption is false.

42:52.320 --> 42:56.075
It was treated as a self-solver from the off and I think that's wrong.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.436
Alice Monroe was found posed in her bed,

42:59.120 --> 43:00.952
Gallagher stuffed into a cupboard.

43:01.120 --> 43:05.558
The post-mortem interval puts the time of death at an hour before she was discovered.

43:05.720 --> 43:08.440
She called her boyfriend and said she was going out with friends.

43:08.600 --> 43:11.069
He came home after work at 1:30 in the morning,

43:11.240 --> 43:13.994
assumed that she was still out and called her.

43:14.160 --> 43:16.038
Her phone rang in the closet,

43:16.200 --> 43:19.591
he went to look and found her stuffed inside, dead.

43:19.760 --> 43:24.835
It's possible the killer was still with her when the boyfriend came home and disturbed him.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.798
So he shoved her in a cupboard and fled.

43:28.920 --> 43:30.434
I just don't buy it.

43:30.600 --> 43:35.470
This would account for the three months between this murder and the killing of Monroe.

43:36.800 --> 43:39.998
It didn't go as planned with Gallagher, and it spooked him.

43:40.160 --> 43:43.631
And so when he struck again, he made sure that he did it right.

43:48.440 --> 43:50.830
Two professional women in their early 30s,

43:51.680 --> 43:54.991
killed in their own homes by strangulation.

43:55.160 --> 43:56.879
Look, they could be sisters.

44:01.720 --> 44:05.316
- The strangulation marks are different.
- The marks might be different,

44:05.480 --> 44:07.756
but both have extensive petechial haemorrhages,

44:07.920 --> 44:11.994
which indicates that he strangled them, released, and strangled again, over and over.

44:12.160 --> 44:14.072
Now you're adding torture into the mix?

44:14.240 --> 44:17.836
It might be sadism or it might just be that his hand lacks strength.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.639
I mean, you try it.

44:19.800 --> 44:22.110
Go on, grab my wrist. See how long you can grip it.

44:26.720 --> 44:28.712
No, thank you.

44:30.440 --> 44:32.750
It's amazing how quickly your hand tires.

44:47.040 --> 44:49.032
Stop, for God's sake.

44:53.640 --> 44:55.711
I mean, how long was that, 30 seconds?

44:58.680 --> 45:00.672
Go back to your review, Stella.

45:02.360 --> 45:04.352
I don't want the two murders linked.

45:31.240 --> 45:35.871
<i>? Rain clouds are moving 'cross an empty sky</i>

45:36.920 --> 45:41.756
<i>? Leaving their shadow on my sleepless sigh</i>

45:42.920 --> 45:47.437
<i>? Flying and hoping that soon we'll be...</i>

45:48.200 --> 45:49.680
Paul?

45:52.240 --> 45:53.959
Yes?

45:54.120 --> 45:55.998
We need you down here.

45:56.160 --> 45:58.516
<i>? Now that I love you</i>

45:59.520 --> 46:03.833
<i>? Do you think that it will end?</i>

46:07.400 --> 46:10.279
<i>? I was above you</i>

46:12.400 --> 46:15.598
<i>? We were just friends</i>

46:18.840 --> 46:20.718
<i>? Now that I've found you...</i>

46:20.880 --> 46:22.872
Daddy!

46:24.160 --> 46:26.959
<i>? It won't take long</i>

46:32.920 --> 46:34.593
What's happening?

46:35.600 --> 46:37.592
Ready when you are.

46:47.480 --> 46:49.472
<i>? You're heading for the road</i>

46:50.280 --> 46:53.398
<i>? You'll be sure time when you're racing for the line...</i>

46:55.200 --> 46:57.192
<i>? We're ready to go</i>

46:59.840 --> 47:01.513
<i>? Get ready to go</i>

47:01.680 --> 47:03.672
<i>? The time is coming</i>

47:04.960 --> 47:06.952
<i>? Your time is coming</i>

47:19.360 --> 47:20.589
Look!

47:23.280 --> 47:25.272
<i>? You're taking over</i>

47:26.760 --> 47:28.752
<i>? Looking over your shoulder</i>

47:30.560 --> 47:32.552
<i>? You're taking over...</i>
- Wow!

47:45.640 --> 47:47.518
How did it go with Burns?

47:48.600 --> 47:50.478
He didn't buy it.

47:50.640 --> 47:52.518
Maybe just as well.

47:52.680 --> 47:57.038
There's no way this team could cope with the increased workload of linked inquiries.

47:57.200 --> 48:00.511
There are probably 200 statements, documents, officers' reports,

48:00.680 --> 48:02.672
waiting to be read and actioned.

48:03.680 --> 48:06.400
Recommend increasing technical support staff.

48:10.000 --> 48:13.357
Failure to see that crimes are linked, linkage blindness...

48:13.520 --> 48:16.638
is the thing that will allow the killer to strike again.

48:17.800 --> 48:21.396
We refuse to recognise the series and he carries on regardless.

48:25.600 --> 48:27.717
I didn't sell it hard enough, Garrett.

48:29.200 --> 48:30.873
<i>I'm off.</i>

48:31.040 --> 48:32.235
Wait.

48:33.520 --> 48:37.116
How you manage to listen to people whining all week in your day job,

48:37.280 --> 48:41.911
and then volunteer to listen to them whining all night on the phone, I'll never know.

48:42.080 --> 48:43.958
This from a neo-natal nurse?

48:44.120 --> 48:45.873
All those crying babies.

48:46.040 --> 48:48.316
The babies I look after are too small to cry.

48:48.480 --> 48:51.632
Crying would be great, crying means they're getting better.

48:51.800 --> 48:55.476
- I'm gonna hit you.
- Maybe you should visit me at work sometime.

48:55.640 --> 48:57.518
Maybe I should.

48:57.680 --> 48:59.672
Say goodnight to the kids.

49:00.400 --> 49:02.392
- Goodnight, you two.
- Night, Daddy!

49:02.560 --> 49:04.552
See you in the morning.

50:00.800 --> 50:02.678
Yes, see. Told you, finally.

50:02.840 --> 50:03.876
Mary?

50:05.440 --> 50:08.831
I wonder if I can book you to look at the exhibits tomorrow morning.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.400
Yes, ma'am.

50:11.280 --> 50:13.670
And I'm going to need a lift back to the hotel.

50:13.840 --> 50:16.400
- We're free, ma'am.
- Good.

50:17.080 --> 50:19.390
Finish your food, I'll wait in reception.

50:22.200 --> 50:23.350
Is it Glen?

50:25.040 --> 50:26.554
Yes, ma'am.

50:27.240 --> 50:31.154
Um...DCI McElroy is doing a violent crime analysis of the last five years.

50:31.320 --> 50:35.314
Could you ask him to also include break-ins where valuables were ignored

50:35.480 --> 50:39.838
but items of clothing, underwear- clean or soiled - were taken?

50:40.120 --> 50:41.952
Underwear, yes, ma'am.

52:10.600 --> 52:13.399
- Who's that?
- James Olson, Detective Sergeant.

52:17.800 --> 52:19.200
Introduce us.

52:25.840 --> 52:30.232
Right, folks, could we move back the other side of the ropes, please?

52:31.280 --> 52:33.431
Come on, all of you, away from the corner.

52:33.600 --> 52:35.478
What's going on, Sergeant?

52:35.640 --> 52:40.112
There's been a shooting in a house about a mile away. A car was stopped along there.

52:40.280 --> 52:43.352
We found guns and arrested three men. Just waiting on the dogs.

52:43.520 --> 52:44.874
Explosives?

52:45.040 --> 52:50.069
This is Detective Superintendent Gibson. She's here to review the Monroe Investigation.

52:50.240 --> 52:52.550
DS Olson. Nice to meet you. It's drugs.

52:52.720 --> 52:54.439
The deceased was well known to us.

52:55.240 --> 52:57.118
Will the review take long?

52:57.280 --> 52:59.272
A week, maybe more.

53:00.280 --> 53:02.556
- I'm staying at the Hilton.
- Very nice.

53:03.280 --> 53:05.272
Room 203.

53:06.720 --> 53:08.712
Jim! Oi!

53:11.120 --> 53:13.112
Good luck with your arrests.

53:30.320 --> 53:32.312
I think we might've fucked up.

53:32.480 --> 53:34.073
What?

53:34.240 --> 53:36.596
- How?
- Did you not hear her?

53:36.760 --> 53:37.989
What?

53:38.160 --> 53:40.880
Robberies where items of underwear were taken.

53:42.600 --> 53:44.319
Sarah Kay.

53:45.160 --> 53:48.437
We should've moved her out of there, put her in a hotel, called in CSIs.

53:48.600 --> 53:52.310
- The woman more or less told us to go.
- I think we should take a look.

54:13.200 --> 54:15.510
Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson?

54:15.680 --> 54:18.070
Ned Callan, Belfast Chronicle. Can I have a word?

54:19.040 --> 54:20.838
Not at the moment, no.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.514
Not even off the record?

54:22.680 --> 54:24.876
There's no such thing, as you well know.

54:30.200 --> 54:32.078
Did I invite you to sit down?

54:32.240 --> 54:34.118
I don't think so.

54:34.280 --> 54:35.953
So, call the police.

54:36.120 --> 54:37.759
How did you find me here?

54:37.920 --> 54:40.594
It's a small city, Stella. It's not easy to hide.

54:41.320 --> 54:44.518
Unless, of course, you're the murderer of Alice Monroe.

54:45.320 --> 54:47.596
You really are a journalist, aren't you?

54:50.520 --> 54:52.671
So why bring someone in from the outside?

54:52.840 --> 54:56.197
That looks remarkably like a vote of no confidence in the PSNI

54:56.360 --> 55:00.434
and its ability to run an internal murder investigation review, don't you think?

55:00.600 --> 55:04.196
What have you found so far- staggering levels of incompetence?

55:04.360 --> 55:06.238
Mr Callan,

55:06.400 --> 55:11.111
no one knows better than me how important the media is as an investigative resource.

55:11.880 --> 55:15.635
But really and truly, you should fuck off now.

55:18.920 --> 55:20.912
You have my card.

55:23.600 --> 55:25.159
Thank you.

55:25.320 --> 55:26.993
Enjoy.

56:44.440 --> 56:45.954
Nothing.

56:58.760 --> 57:02.515
This is a message for Sarah Kay. Sarah, this is PC Danni Ferrington.

57:02.680 --> 57:07.391
<i>I'm calling from outside your house. If you're there, it is the police at the door.</i>

57:07.560 --> 57:09.438
<i>I was hoping to speak with you...</i>

57:11.280 --> 57:14.591
<i>Please ring the number I gave you when you get this message.</i>

57:29.480 --> 57:31.676
Perhaps she did go stay with her sister.

57:32.305 --> 57:38.807
