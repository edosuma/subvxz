00:06.100 --> 00:07.900
Hey, guys,                      

00:08.000 --> 00:09.200
  guess what followed me home.  

00:09.300 --> 00:11.600
                  A slime trail?

00:11.600 --> 00:14.800
        This cute little        
    fellow right here.          

00:14.800 --> 00:15.900
Huh?                            

00:16.000 --> 00:17.600
        Isn't he sweet?         

00:17.600 --> 00:20.700
     The cutest little dog      
     you've ever seen, huh?     

00:20.800 --> 00:22.000
            What you gonna do   
                with him, Cliff?

00:22.000 --> 00:24.500
Oh, I, I thought we'd just keep 
him in the bar here, Sam,       

00:24.600 --> 00:25.900
     you know, kind of like     
         a bar mascot.          

00:26.000 --> 00:30.300
    Guys, I kind of thought     
     I was the bar mascot.      

00:30.400 --> 00:33.100
I don't think so, Cliffy.       

00:33.100 --> 00:35.800
    All right, Sammy.           

00:35.800 --> 00:37.200
        Come on, Spotty.        

00:37.200 --> 00:39.000
            Bye-bye, Spotty.    

00:41.900 --> 00:45.400
         Oh, how cute.          

00:45.500 --> 00:48.000
Hi, little fellow.              

00:48.100 --> 00:49.200
    Ah.                         

00:49.300 --> 00:50.800
What's his name?                

00:50.900 --> 00:54.200
         Well, this is,         
      this is Spotty, huh?      

00:54.300 --> 00:56.700
                  Isn't he cute?

00:56.800 --> 00:59.300
         Yeah, he's kind of like
             the-the bar mascot.

00:59.300 --> 01:00.500
                  Hey, you know,

01:00.600 --> 01:02.400
    he and I are about          
        to take a bath.

02:17.400 --> 02:19.500
                Hey, Mr. Clavin,

02:19.500 --> 02:21.700
        if you're looking for   
    a home for the dog there,   

02:21.800 --> 02:23.200
                    I'd be happy
                    to take him.

02:23.200 --> 02:24.300
Ah, no, Woody.                  

02:24.400 --> 02:27.200
You see, Spotty here is         
a thoroughbred puppy.           

02:27.300 --> 02:30.200
Needs a lot of attention, a lot 
 of care, needs a lot of space. 

02:30.200 --> 02:31.800
    I'll give you five bucks    
            for him.            

02:31.900 --> 02:32.900
          Here you go.          

02:36.000 --> 02:37.700
      Hello. Any messages?      

02:37.800 --> 02:39.200
        Oh, yeah.               

02:39.200 --> 02:41.900
    One of your old baseball    
 buddies called, Dutch Kincaid. 

02:42.000 --> 02:43.800
        I'll be damned.         
     Wonder what he wants?      

02:43.900 --> 02:45.600
Probably another home run.      

02:45.600 --> 02:49.100
I think you served him up       
something like 27 in his career.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.800
                What did that   
            work out to, Sam?   

02:51.900 --> 02:56.100
    Oh, yeah, uh, one           
  for every time he faced you.  

02:56.200 --> 02:58.800
    That was a long time ago.   
                        Yeah.   

02:58.900 --> 03:00.400
      Poor guy's probably       
         down and out--         

03:00.500 --> 03:02.400
  wants to borrow a few bucks   
            from me.            

03:02.400 --> 03:04.100
  No. He wants you to show up   

03:04.200 --> 03:06.600
     for Dutch Kincaid Day      
    at Yankee Stadium.          

03:06.700 --> 03:09.400
  They're having a Dutch Kincaid
          Day at Yankee Stadium?

03:09.500 --> 03:11.900
Yeah. They're bringing him back 
for one more time at bat        

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
before the game.                

03:13.100 --> 03:14.700
He wants you to pitch to him.   

03:14.800 --> 03:16.900
          Smart guy, that Dutch.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
          He's gotta be kidding.

03:19.100 --> 03:21.700
             Why the hell should
             I want to help him?

03:21.800 --> 03:24.100
     I, I'm gonna get on a plane
        and fly down to New York

03:24.200 --> 03:25.600
                just to give him
            some free publicity?

03:25.600 --> 03:27.000
What are you worried about?     

03:27.100 --> 03:28.900
You afraid he's                 
gonna pop one out               

03:28.900 --> 03:31.800
and you're going to have to see 
the old Dutch Windmill again?   

03:31.900 --> 03:33.600
  What is the Dutch Windmill?   

03:33.600 --> 03:35.200
                  Oh, every time
              Dutch hit a homer,

03:35.200 --> 03:38.000
 he used to do this little dance
  while he ran around the bases.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.400
     It's kind of his trademark.

03:39.500 --> 03:40.500
Yeah, if memory serves,         

03:40.600 --> 03:41.700
it was something like this.     

03:41.700 --> 03:42.800
He'd have that                  
left arm pumping,               

03:42.900 --> 03:44.300
and the right arm               
like a windmill,                

03:44.400 --> 03:45.900
and wiggle his fanny            
back and forth.                 

03:46.000 --> 03:47.600
                        NORM:   
                     No, no, no,

03:47.700 --> 03:49.100
                 more like this.

03:49.200 --> 03:50.300
     No, Norm, less jiggle.     

03:50.400 --> 03:52.200
            I haven't started   
                    dancing yet.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.700
Hey, this is fun.               

03:57.800 --> 04:00.000
    Did you have                
    a trademark, Sam?           

04:00.100 --> 04:01.700
                     Shut up and
                 leave me alone.

04:01.800 --> 04:04.400
     Actually, Sam, that's      
        more of a motto.        

04:09.100 --> 04:11.600
No, come on, man, don't         
let him lick your... Ew!        

04:11.700 --> 04:13.400
Don't let him lick              
your lips like that.            

04:13.500 --> 04:14.500
             Oh, it's okay.     

04:14.600 --> 04:16.300
    You know, it's an           
        interesting fact        

04:16.399 --> 04:18.899
        that that dog's mouth   
             is probably cleaner

04:18.899 --> 04:20.200
     than anybody's in this bar.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.500
                There's a shock.

04:23.700 --> 04:25.800
Fras, how about you?            
You want to play                
with the puppy?                 

04:25.900 --> 04:28.400
         I don't know.          

04:28.400 --> 04:29.800
 Uh, my mother never allowed me 

04:29.900 --> 04:31.900
        to have a puppy         
    when I was a boy.           

04:31.900 --> 04:37.100
  Consequently, she instilled   
in me a slight fear of animals. 

04:37.100 --> 04:39.700
    I'd say it's about time     
    you got over that.          

04:39.800 --> 04:41.000
        Come on, now, Spotty.   

04:41.100 --> 04:43.100
         I want you to say hello
          to your Uncle Frasier.

04:46.400 --> 04:48.800
Well, hello, Spotty.            

04:51.900 --> 04:54.700
Norm, I, I think Spotty         
wants to go away now.           

04:54.700 --> 04:56.200
             No. He feels pretty
  comfortable there, doesn't he?

04:56.300 --> 04:59.400
Well, did I mention to          
you that, uh, Spotty            
wants to buy you a beer?        

04:59.400 --> 05:01.300
    Good boy, Scotty.           

05:05.000 --> 05:05.700
        Can I help you?         

05:05.900 --> 05:08.300
Yeah. I'm looking for           
a yellow-bellied,               

05:08.300 --> 05:10.600
runny-nosed has-been.           

05:10.700 --> 05:12.500
                 Hmm, can't make
                one of those.   

05:12.500 --> 05:14.000
              I'm out of cassis.

05:18.700 --> 05:20.400
         Hello, Dutch.          

05:20.500 --> 05:22.200
            Mayday.             

05:22.300 --> 05:23.700
    What are you doing here?    

05:23.700 --> 05:26.400
I hear you're too chicken       
    to pitch to me, Fluffy.     

05:26.500 --> 05:28.100
What's the matter,              

05:28.200 --> 05:30.500
afraid I'll make you            
look bad again?                 

05:30.500 --> 05:31.800
                  I'm not afraid
             of anything, Dutch.

05:31.800 --> 05:33.700
    And I don't have anything   
            to prove, either.   

05:33.800 --> 05:35.200
     Hey, you know, Malone,     
        if word gets out        

05:35.300 --> 05:36.500
      that you're pitching      
          to me again,          

05:36.500 --> 05:39.200
it might give the guy           
the kind of publicity           

05:39.200 --> 05:41.400
that would put him back         
in the public eye.              

05:41.400 --> 05:43.600
Maybe even in the Hall of Fame. 

05:43.700 --> 05:45.400
                  Oh, get out.  

05:45.500 --> 05:47.500
            I could never get   
          into the Hall of Fame.

05:47.500 --> 05:49.800
    Not you, you pantywaist.    

05:52.000 --> 05:54.500
It's Dutch Kincaid Day,         
not Sam Malone Day.             

05:54.500 --> 05:57.600
    Man, what an ego.           

05:59.500 --> 06:01.800
     Find yourself another      
    sucker, will you?           

06:01.800 --> 06:03.000
             Okay.              

06:03.000 --> 06:05.100
Have you got a men's room       
            in here?            

06:05.200 --> 06:07.600
 Oh, what am I asking you for?  

06:07.600 --> 06:10.500
            It's in the back.   

06:10.600 --> 06:12.400
         Yeah, thanks.          

06:12.400 --> 06:16.500
Oh, uh, I gave my neighbor's kid
a Sam Malone baseball card      

06:16.500 --> 06:18.700
     to stick in his spokes     
          of his bike.          

06:18.700 --> 06:22.700
 Now, when he rides it, it goes 
"wimp, wimp, wimp, wimp, wimp." 

06:25.000 --> 06:25.800
                 Come on, Sammy,
                    let's go.   

06:25.900 --> 06:27.600
            It would be great to
            see you pitch again.

06:27.700 --> 06:29.400
No way. I told him "no"         
and I meant it.                 

06:29.400 --> 06:31.500
     Come on, the guy is a jerk.

06:31.500 --> 06:32.900
         You've got to nail him.
            No.                 

06:33.000 --> 06:34.100
      Knock him down a few pegs.

06:34.200 --> 06:35.200
No. No-no-no.                   

06:35.200 --> 06:37.500
                  Oh, no.       

06:37.600 --> 06:39.700
        You're afraid he's still
    gonna be able to hit you.   

06:39.800 --> 06:41.100
Oh, are you kidding me?         

06:41.200 --> 06:43.100
The guy's a washed-up           
old has-been.                   

06:43.200 --> 06:44.600
I mean, he hasn't               
played for years.               

06:44.600 --> 06:47.200
I can strike him out with one   
hand tied behind my back.       

06:47.300 --> 06:48.300
             Worth a try, Sammy.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.300
     The other way never worked.

06:51.700 --> 06:53.200
That was then, you know.        

06:53.300 --> 06:55.200
Now I've got the edge on him.   

06:55.200 --> 06:56.800
I'm young. You know,            
I'm in good shape.              

06:56.900 --> 06:59.400
    Aw, shoot.                  

06:59.500 --> 07:03.100
I've got to remember            
to warm up before I do that.    

07:05.100 --> 07:07.000
                So why don't you
            just go out there   

07:07.100 --> 07:09.700
            and humiliate him   
                for a change?   
                        Yeah.   

07:09.800 --> 07:10.500
                 Come on, Sammy.
          Yeah, Sammy.          

07:10.600 --> 07:11.900
Listen to yourselves, will ya?  

07:12.000 --> 07:13.200
Have some class.                

07:13.300 --> 07:14.400
The guy's an old man.           

07:14.400 --> 07:15.500
                        FRASIER:
              Good for you, Sam.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.200
  I'm impressed by your stand.  

07:17.300 --> 07:18.900
    It shows real maturity.     

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
 Yeah, well, it's gonna take a  
 lot more than a stupid insult  

07:21.000 --> 07:23.100
  to get me to go all the way   
          to New York.          

07:23.200 --> 07:26.300
I'll see you later, Underpants. 

07:26.300 --> 07:28.000
         That does it!          

07:28.100 --> 07:29.500
                 All right, I'll
            see you Saturday.   

07:29.600 --> 07:30.900
    Yankee Stadium.             

07:30.900 --> 07:32.200
    That's the spirit.          

07:32.200 --> 07:34.400
 Listen, and don't worry about  
getting into the stadium.       

07:34.500 --> 07:36.100
    Saturday is Ladies Day.     

08:05.600 --> 08:08.100
              ¶                 

08:38.100 --> 08:40.200
              ¶                 

09:01.300 --> 09:05.600
  That'll teach you to pinch a  
 lady's butt in a locker room.  

09:05.600 --> 09:06.800
                     Guys giving
                    you trouble?

09:06.900 --> 09:08.500
              No.               

09:08.600 --> 09:11.200
I was teaching them how to pinch
a lady's butt in a locker room. 

09:12.800 --> 09:15.300
            Ah, look at this.   

09:15.400 --> 09:20.400
                I'm focused, I'm
             psyched, I'm sober.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.400
        Hey, Dutch doesn't stand
                 a chance today?

09:22.500 --> 09:23.700
        Yeah.                   

09:26.500 --> 09:28.400
                  Only one thing
                missing, huh?   

09:28.400 --> 09:30.000
    I know, Sam.                

09:30.100 --> 09:32.700
                    Yeah, I wish
                Coach were here.

09:32.700 --> 09:34.400
        He is.                  

09:34.500 --> 09:38.600
        ANNOUNCER:              
Attention, ladies and gentlemen,
         welcome to...          

09:38.700 --> 09:42.000
Call me sentimental, but doesn't
this bring back the old days?   

09:42.100 --> 09:43.600
                    Yeah.       

09:43.700 --> 09:46.000
I want you to get               
out there, Sammy,               

09:46.000 --> 09:48.900
grind him into a raw,           
meaty pulp,                     

09:49.000 --> 09:53.400
spread him on home plate        
and slide into his guts.        

09:53.500 --> 09:56.000
(sobbing):                      
I've got to get a Kleenex.      

09:57.900 --> 10:00.300
        Hey, Sam Malone.        

10:00.300 --> 10:01.200
             Yeah.              

10:01.300 --> 10:02.500
                Cap Richards.   

10:02.600 --> 10:04.100
                     I'm Dutch's
            personal manager.   

10:04.100 --> 10:05.700
                I cooked up this
                    whole thing.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.400
             Glad I got a chance
                 to talk to you.

10:07.500 --> 10:08.900
                  Uh, here's how
                it's gonna work.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.200
     Throw the first two pitches
            however you want.   

10:11.300 --> 10:14.100
          The third one, though,
    just float it across home   
        plate, nice and easy.   

10:14.200 --> 10:16.500
        Oh, what?               
    Yeah, I thought the home run
          would be more dramatic

10:16.500 --> 10:17.600
             on the third pitch.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.700
        But if you want to do it
             on the first pitch,

10:19.700 --> 10:20.900
     like you used to, go ahead.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.500
    You've gotta be kidding.    

10:23.500 --> 10:26.200
Sam Malone does not take a dive.

10:26.200 --> 10:29.300
Yeah, I came down here          
to strike this guy out          
and that's what I'm gonna do.   

10:29.400 --> 10:31.200
 You know, if he wants to get a 
hit, he's gonna have to earn it.

10:31.200 --> 10:33.000
         Whoa, this is not good.

10:36.600 --> 10:38.300
We have a special ceremony      
         in honor of...         

10:38.400 --> 10:41.100
            You ready, Sammy?   
        Yeah.                   

10:41.100 --> 10:42.400
    ...Dutch Kincaid.           

10:42.400 --> 10:44.600
    I can strike this           
    guy out, can't I?           

10:44.600 --> 10:45.800
    Of course you can.          

10:45.900 --> 10:47.700
                         Listen,

10:47.800 --> 10:50.600
      this is your chance       
  to make up for the old days.  

10:50.700 --> 10:53.100
      It's the last thing       
  anyone's ever gonna remember  

10:53.200 --> 10:56.900
about Sammy Mayday Malone-- that
  he struck out Dutch Kincaid.  

10:56.900 --> 10:59.600
             Now go on out there
    and smoke three fast ones   

10:59.700 --> 11:02.700
        past that lousy         
      flat-headed bastard.      

11:02.700 --> 11:05.300
        (sobbing):              
 I need to get another Kleenex. 

11:15.200 --> 11:16.400
        Yeah? Huh?              

11:16.500 --> 11:17.500
            Oh.                 

11:17.600 --> 11:18.600
                      Excuse me,

11:18.700 --> 11:19.900
      are you Sam Malone?       

11:19.900 --> 11:21.100
             Yeah.              

11:21.100 --> 11:22.500
Yeah. Wh-wh-what's your name?   

11:22.600 --> 11:24.400
             Billy Kincaid.     
How do you do, Billy?           

11:24.500 --> 11:28.100
Oh, now you wouldn't,           
you wouldn't be a relation      

11:28.100 --> 11:29.400
to Dutch Kincaid would you?     

11:29.500 --> 11:30.800
        He's my grandpa.        

11:30.900 --> 11:32.700
              I've heard all his
              neat stories about

11:32.700 --> 11:35.500
    how you used to help him    
hit those long home runs.       

11:35.500 --> 11:37.300
                     I never got
             to see one, though.

11:37.400 --> 11:39.200
I sure hope I can see one today.

11:41.700 --> 11:46.100
I may have to                   
disappoint you there.           

11:46.100 --> 11:49.000
     This is the last time      
 Grandpa's ever going to play.  

11:49.000 --> 11:53.300
            It's today or never.

11:53.300 --> 11:54.900
Go away, will you?              
Go on.                          

11:57.400 --> 12:00.900
  My two brothers and my baby   
sister are all watching at home.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.500
    None of us ever saw him     
        hit a home run.         

12:04.600 --> 12:07.100
Give me a break, will you?      

12:07.200 --> 12:10.800
    Grandpa told us he wants    
     to hit a ball so hard,     

12:10.800 --> 12:15.200
     it'll go up to heaven,     
so Grandma can say hello.       

12:21.500 --> 12:25.200
      ANNOUNCER (over PA):      
Now pitching, Sam Malone.       

12:29.200 --> 12:30.500
        Yeah, all right.        

12:34.000 --> 12:35.400
            Hey, how'd it go?   

12:35.500 --> 12:38.000
    Great.                      

12:38.100 --> 12:39.400
Need me to scalp                
any tickets?                    

12:39.400 --> 12:40.500
             No, no, you've done
            enough for today.   

12:40.600 --> 12:42.000
        Thanks, Vinnie.         

12:51.100 --> 12:53.300
      Hey, you guys aren't      
    supposed to be in here.     

12:53.400 --> 12:55.100
            That's all right,   
          we're with Sam Malone.

12:55.100 --> 12:56.200
                         Mm-hmm.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.500
We're his personal trainers.    

13:00.900 --> 13:02.500
So you're okay down here?       

13:02.600 --> 13:04.300
            (chuckles)          

13:04.300 --> 13:07.000
                 We know our way
         around a dugout, pally.

13:07.100 --> 13:08.400
Look out, Cliffy.               
Incoming.                       

13:11.300 --> 13:15.700
     Boy, that ball girl's      
    really got an arm, huh?     

13:15.700 --> 13:18.400
      Here you go, Toots.       

13:18.500 --> 13:20.600
                     Aw, Norm.  
    What?                       

13:20.600 --> 13:24.600
              Barbecue sauce got
            all over the nachos.

13:34.400 --> 13:37.400
    Hey...                      
                        Hey...  

13:41.600 --> 13:43.300
Hey, guys, did I                
miss anything?                  

13:43.400 --> 13:45.000
    Sam hasn't started yet.     
Oh.                             

13:45.100 --> 13:46.200
        Where you been?         

13:46.300 --> 13:47.900
     Oh, I've been visiting     
        the other team.         

13:48.000 --> 13:50.500
I ran into somebody I used      
  to get hot and sweaty with.   

13:50.600 --> 13:51.200
    Who's that?                 

13:51.300 --> 13:53.500
        The other team.         

13:53.600 --> 13:57.800
 And now, stepping to the plate 
      to face Sam Malone,       

13:57.800 --> 14:00.100
the man we all turned out today 
          to honor...           

14:00.200 --> 14:02.100
         Dutch Kincaid.         

14:02.200 --> 14:03.100
        (applause)              

14:03.200 --> 14:05.000
Boo-o-o-o!                      
                      Boo-o-o-o!
        Boo-o-o-o!              

14:13.300 --> 14:14.900
         Hey, you guys, come on.
                The first pitch.

14:15.900 --> 14:18.200
        Okay, Sammy go!         
             Go-go!             

14:18.300 --> 14:20.100
Come on, Sammy.                 

14:20.200 --> 14:21.900
      (ball thuds in mitt)      
Oh, yeah!                       
            Strike one!         

14:22.000 --> 14:23.700
        Go, Sammy!              

14:23.800 --> 14:25.800
All right, Sammy.               

14:25.900 --> 14:27.100
     Look at him out there.     

14:27.200 --> 14:29.300
                 Doesn't he look
              cool on the mound?

14:29.300 --> 14:30.500
                    Oh, I've got
                    goose bumps.

14:30.600 --> 14:31.900
Yeah, all right,                
here comes the stretch.         

14:32.000 --> 14:33.800
  Hey, ram it down his throat,  
             Sammy!             

14:33.900 --> 14:35.000
                      Sammy, oh!
Come on, Sammy!                 

14:35.100 --> 14:36.900
      (ball thuds in mitt)      
Oh, yeah!                       
            Strike two!         

14:37.000 --> 14:38.700
        (wild cheering)         
Oh, yeah!                       

14:40.800 --> 14:42.500
                    Bring on the
                    heat, Sammy!

14:42.500 --> 14:45.300
                    He can't hit
              what he can't see!

14:45.400 --> 14:46.700
          (loud crack)          

14:46.700 --> 14:49.400
Apparently,                     
he saw that one.                

14:49.400 --> 14:51.000
        ANNOUNCER:              
     Look at that ball go.      

14:51.100 --> 14:52.600
          It may clear          
    the center field fence.     

14:52.700 --> 14:55.500
    It's going, going,          
    it's out of here!           

14:55.600 --> 14:58.200
        (crowd cheering)        

15:06.000 --> 15:08.200
          Poor Sammy.           

15:08.300 --> 15:10.700
 Wow, he must feel lousy, huh?  

15:10.700 --> 15:13.300
         Yeah, he's really gonna
            need our support.   

15:13.400 --> 15:16.000
Well, we'll just have           
to be really nice to him.       

15:16.100 --> 15:17.700
We can sneak out of here.       

15:17.800 --> 15:19.700
    I know a shortcut           
      through the showers.      

15:19.800 --> 15:21.700
Better yet.                     

15:21.800 --> 15:23.100
                    Too late.   

15:23.200 --> 15:24.500
                He's seen us.   

15:25.400 --> 15:26.800
             Okay.              

15:26.900 --> 15:27.800
  I know what you're thinking.  

15:27.900 --> 15:29.600
        But I can explain it.   

15:29.700 --> 15:31.600
                I know it looked
                like a home run.

15:31.600 --> 15:32.700
Yeah, our first clue            
was when the ball               

15:32.800 --> 15:34.700
actually left the stadium.      

15:36.300 --> 15:39.200
Yeah, but it doesn't count      
  'cause I did it on purpose.   

15:39.200 --> 15:40.200
                      All right.

15:40.300 --> 15:41.500
                  Oh, sure, Sam.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.800
You let him get a home run      
      off you on purpose.       

15:43.900 --> 15:44.500
            No, no.             

15:44.700 --> 15:46.600
I did it for Kincaid's grandkid.

15:46.700 --> 15:50.000
He wanted to see his grandfather
     hit a home run, so...      

15:50.100 --> 15:51.300
Well, hell, he can              
explain it to you.              

15:51.300 --> 15:52.300
Billy.                          

15:52.300 --> 15:53.800
        Yo, hey, Billy!         

15:54.700 --> 15:56.500
        Oh, right, Sam.         

15:56.600 --> 15:58.100
    Whatever you say.           

15:58.200 --> 15:59.400
We believe you.                 

15:59.500 --> 16:00.500
                     Why are you
            using that voice?   

16:00.500 --> 16:02.000
            That's your "I don't
             believe you" voice.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.700
No it's not, Sam.               
I do believe you.               

16:06.000 --> 16:07.600
                Then why are you
                still talking...

16:07.700 --> 16:09.400
            Oh, come on, listen,
Billy'll tell you everything.   

16:09.400 --> 16:10.400
                     Hey, Billy!

16:10.500 --> 16:11.800
                 Come on, Billy!
        Sam, Sam.               

16:11.900 --> 16:13.100
Come on.                        
Let's go home.                  

16:13.100 --> 16:15.400
We get to go on                 
an airplane ride.               

16:15.500 --> 16:18.000
 And maybe when we're up there, 

16:18.100 --> 16:21.300
we'll get to see that pitch     
you served Dutch.               

16:21.300 --> 16:23.800
                I'm telling you,
            I did it on purpose.

16:23.900 --> 16:24.800
                 I swear to God.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.000
     There was this kid...      

16:26.100 --> 16:27.500
        Come on, Billy!         

16:27.600 --> 16:28.900
    This isn't funny!           

16:34.300 --> 16:36.900
          ...78, 79...          

16:40.400 --> 16:42.000
              If you keep moving
                 around, Spotty,

16:42.000 --> 16:45.300
        I'm not gonna be able   
    to get an accurate count.   

16:45.300 --> 16:49.500
        One, two, three, four...

16:49.500 --> 16:50.900
    Woody.                      
                        five... 

16:50.900 --> 16:53.700
I guess you've given up         
on finding his owner, huh?      

16:53.800 --> 16:56.400
     Well, why don't you want me
     to have this dog, Ms. Howe?

16:56.500 --> 16:59.300
It's not that I don't want you  
to have the dog, Woody,         

16:59.400 --> 17:01.200
it's just that                  
I have this... this thing       

17:01.300 --> 17:05.599
about being completely honest   
when it comes to lost pets.     

17:05.700 --> 17:07.800
Okay, when I was                
ten years old,                  

17:07.800 --> 17:10.500
I had this beautiful            
Persian cat named Princess.     

17:10.500 --> 17:11.599
She only loved me.              

17:11.599 --> 17:13.400
She didn't like anybody         
else in my family.              

17:13.500 --> 17:15.900
One day I woke up,              
Princess was gone.              

17:16.000 --> 17:18.500
My mom and dad said             
that she got out                

17:18.599 --> 17:19.800
through the bedroom window.     

17:19.800 --> 17:22.099
             The weird thing is,

17:22.200 --> 17:24.200
I could have sworn              
that bedroom window             

17:24.200 --> 17:25.500
was painted shut.               

17:25.500 --> 17:28.000
It bothered me for years.       

17:28.099 --> 17:31.100
      Then as you matured,      
  you came to accept the fact   

17:31.200 --> 17:34.400
 that it was your parents who,  
  in fact, got rid of the cat.  

17:36.400 --> 17:38.200
        What?!                  

17:46.200 --> 17:48.700
    My Princess?!               

17:48.800 --> 17:52.100
They took my Princess?!         

17:55.600 --> 17:58.400
 Oh, boy, me and my big mouth.  

17:58.400 --> 18:00.200
    Why don't I just go down    
          to the park           

18:00.300 --> 18:02.500
    and tell the little kids    
    about Santa Claus?          

18:02.600 --> 18:05.100
    What about Santa?           

18:13.400 --> 18:15.800
                    But we do   
            believe you, Sam.   

18:15.900 --> 18:18.100
    I'm getting tired           
         of that voice.         

18:18.100 --> 18:20.200
     You know, I don't care     
      what you guys think.      

18:20.300 --> 18:22.400
          In my heart,          
      I know I did this...      

18:22.500 --> 18:25.300
              ALL:              
      ...for a little boy       
and his dead grandmother.       

18:27.200 --> 18:29.800
                 Oh, guys, look.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.300
              Spotty fell asleep
                     on my shoe.

18:33.300 --> 18:35.600
             He's so sweet.     

18:35.600 --> 18:37.400
          I just wish           
     I was wearing sandals      

18:37.500 --> 18:40.300
        so I could feel         
    his little puppy breath.    

18:44.600 --> 18:46.400
         Hi, gentlemen.         
      What can I get you?       

18:46.400 --> 18:48.000
          Just coffee.          
         We're on duty.         

18:50.000 --> 18:51.700
    What's the matter?          

18:51.700 --> 18:54.000
      Well, two weeks ago       
    our dog ran away.           

18:54.000 --> 18:56.500
Cutest little puppy             
you ever saw.                   

18:56.600 --> 18:57.700
    He's just about so big.     

18:57.800 --> 19:00.200
      Today, Chief made us      
      give up our search.       

19:00.300 --> 19:01.600
              Oh.               

19:06.500 --> 19:10.500
     Woody, I think they're     
     talking about Spotty.      

19:10.500 --> 19:11.700
Do you want                     
to say something?               

19:11.800 --> 19:12.800
                        No.     

19:12.800 --> 19:16.600
              Make them go away.

19:16.600 --> 19:17.600
Come on, Woody.                 

19:17.700 --> 19:19.700
It is obvious that              
it is their dog.                

19:19.800 --> 19:21.100
And give me a break,            
a Dalmatian,                    

19:21.200 --> 19:22.200
the fire department.            

19:22.300 --> 19:24.200
                It's a different
                dog, ratfink.   

19:25.600 --> 19:27.900
            Just 'cause you lost
                your stupid cat.

19:30.400 --> 19:31.800
            Remember when       
                he was born?    

19:31.900 --> 19:32.900
        Oh-h-h-h.               

19:32.900 --> 19:34.600
 We each took hour-long shifts  

19:34.600 --> 19:36.300
     feeding him warm milk      
     through an eyedropper.     

19:36.300 --> 19:38.800
Remember how he used to         
fall asleep on my shoe?         

19:38.900 --> 19:40.000
Yeah.                           

19:40.100 --> 19:41.900
I can still feel his            
warm little puppy breath.       

19:41.900 --> 19:45.000
            (cries)             

19:47.600 --> 19:49.200
              What is it?       

19:49.300 --> 19:50.700
            Nothing.            

19:50.800 --> 19:53.300
            Go away.            
 Isn't there a fire somewhere?  

19:55.300 --> 19:57.500
        Oh, the heck with it.   

19:57.600 --> 19:59.400
I didn't want him anyway.       

19:59.400 --> 20:00.900
    He's all covered with spots.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.100
         Hey-hey-hey...         

20:03.200 --> 20:05.200
         Take him, I didn't know
        he was yours, honest.   

20:05.300 --> 20:06.300
                    Thanks, kid.

20:06.300 --> 20:08.100
             Looks like you took
          real good care of him.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.000
             Yeah.              
                You know, we had
            a reward posted--   

20:10.100 --> 20:11.100
                a hundred bucks.

20:11.100 --> 20:12.900
                Oh, I don't care
                about the money.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.100
              I just want what's
                best for Spotty.

20:15.100 --> 20:17.300
        Gee, I'm, sorry, kid.   

20:18.600 --> 20:22.800
        Now, a ride on a real   
         fire engine might help.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.100
We can't let you do that.       

20:26.200 --> 20:28.500
            (cries):            
      I miss him so much!       

20:28.500 --> 20:30.200
             All right, come on.

20:30.200 --> 20:31.400
         But don't tell anybody.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.400
             Yeah!              

20:33.400 --> 20:35.200
            Hey, can I, can I   
                  run the siren?

20:35.300 --> 20:37.500
      No, that would be illegal.

20:37.600 --> 20:40.600
                        (cries):
          Oh, geez, Spotty meant
            everything to me!   

20:40.700 --> 20:42.800
        All right, you can      
        turn on the siren.      

20:42.900 --> 20:44.300
Well, can I wear your hat?      

20:44.300 --> 20:46.000
It's part of the uniform.       

20:46.100 --> 20:47.300
    Well, can I drive,          

20:47.400 --> 20:48.300
                please, please?!

20:48.400 --> 20:49.900
      Here, take the dog.       

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
         Take the dog.          

20:52.100 --> 20:54.700
                  (crying)      

20:54.800 --> 20:56.700
      We snowed 'em, dude.      

21:05.000 --> 21:06.800
  Where's little Miss Malone?   

21:06.800 --> 21:07.800
         In the office?         

21:07.900 --> 21:09.800
Haven't you humiliated him      
            enough?             

21:09.900 --> 21:12.800
        Hey, not as much        
      as he humiliated me.      

21:12.900 --> 21:14.600
        Hey, Malone...!         

21:14.600 --> 21:17.100
     Pull on your pantyhose     
    and get out here.           

21:17.200 --> 21:18.800
  We've got a score to settle.  

21:18.900 --> 21:19.900
                 Come on, Dutch.

21:19.900 --> 21:21.100
You had your home run.          

21:21.200 --> 21:22.800
    Why don't we just           
    leave it at that?           

21:22.900 --> 21:25.100
I'm not gonna leave it at that. 

21:25.100 --> 21:27.400
                You deliberately
          threw me a cream puff.

21:27.500 --> 21:29.200
            I don't need your   
                charity pitches.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.500
I didn't do it for you.         

21:30.500 --> 21:31.900
I did it for your grandkid.     

21:32.000 --> 21:33.800
      I don't have any grandkid.

21:33.900 --> 21:35.600
What do you mean, you           
don't have any grandkid?        

21:35.700 --> 21:38.100
                Naw, my personal
             manager and his kid

21:38.100 --> 21:39.900
              are always pulling
                      that scam.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.800
        That's how I got        
    Dutch Kincaid Day.          

21:44.400 --> 21:45.700
This was a setup?               

21:45.800 --> 21:47.500
     I had a chance finally     

21:47.500 --> 21:49.500
to strike you out in front      
  of a stadium full of people   

21:49.500 --> 21:52.200
     and I had to let it go     
for a stupid, lousy setup?      

21:52.300 --> 21:54.200
                You never had   
            a chance, Malone.   

21:54.200 --> 21:56.400
              I can hit anything
            you can serve up.   

21:56.600 --> 21:57.900
          Oh, come on.          
        Give me a break.        

21:58.000 --> 21:59.700
      My first two pitches      
    went right by you.          

21:59.800 --> 22:03.100
     Well, I let them go by     
         for the drama.         

22:03.100 --> 22:05.000
             Drama?             

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
    You let them go by          
         for the drama?         

22:07.000 --> 22:08.100
        You want drama?         

22:08.100 --> 22:09.500
      I'll give you drama.      

22:09.500 --> 22:11.600
Come with me, you, you,         
come on, right now.             

22:11.700 --> 22:12.800
                      All right.

22:12.800 --> 22:14.500
            There's still plenty
          of daylight out there.

22:14.500 --> 22:15.600
                    Let's do it.

22:15.700 --> 22:16.700
    Yeah, well, I'll be back    

22:16.800 --> 22:18.900
in about three pitches, fellas. 

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Two grown men                   
settling a rivalry              

22:21.100 --> 22:23.900
by throwing a little white ball 
at a wooden stick.              

22:24.000 --> 22:25.800
How pathetic.                   

22:25.900 --> 22:27.200
         Now, boxing...         

22:27.300 --> 22:29.300
     that's a man's sport.      

22:29.400 --> 22:31.700
    Punch a guy in the face     
    and scramble his brains.    

22:31.900 --> 22:33.700
     That proves something.     

22:33.800 --> 22:35.900
             Fras, you're coming
                  around, buddy.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.500
        Thank you.              

22:41.100 --> 22:43.800
    Hey, shut up, you guys,     
    Sammy's pitching.           

22:43.900 --> 22:45.300
            (crack)             

22:45.300 --> 22:48.100
          Oh, my God,           
 there's two moons in the sky.  

22:48.100 --> 22:50.100
SAM:                            
All right, lucky hit.           

22:50.200 --> 22:52.000
Let's go again.                 

22:52.100 --> 22:53.300
            (crack)             

22:53.300 --> 22:56.400
Gee, he almost hit              
a helicopter.                   

22:59.500 --> 23:00.900
            (crack)             

23:01.000 --> 23:04.300
SAM:                            
Okay, 226 lucky hits.           

23:06.000 --> 23:07.300
             CARLA:             
     Hang in there, Sammy.      

23:07.400 --> 23:09.800
        He's old.               
     He can't live forever.
