20:14.302 --> 20:16.554
Ow! Do you need to go
to the hospital for that?

20:16.638 --> 20:19.432
No, God. No, no.
It's not that bad.

20:19.516 --> 20:21.893
Oh, you meant call 911,
didn't you?

20:21.976 --> 20:23.019
[ Together]
Firemen.

20:23.103 --> 20:25.480
Yeah, you call, and I'm
gonna change my shirt.

20:26.815 --> 20:29.317
<i>So, if I 777 supposed to
act like an adult;</i>

20:29.401 --> 20:32.445
<i>is that act like adults
! see in the world—</i>

20:32.529 --> 20:36.533
- [ Both Shouting ]
<i>- Or the adults in my family?</i>

[ Shutter Clicks ]

20:39.536 --> 20:43.415
<i>'Cause if it's the ones
in my family—</i>

20:43.540 --> 20:46.876
Come on. Let's go.
All right.

20:46.960 --> 20:49.379
<i>Then...</i>

20:49.462 --> 20:51.840
how hard could that be?

20:53.174 --> 20:54.175
[ Screams ]

20:57.345 --> 21:01.182
Doing the card tricks at the hospital
really got me fired up about my magic again.

21:01.266 --> 21:04.686
[ Blows]
Is this your card?

21:04.769 --> 21:07.439
Yes. Oh, my gosh.

[Clears Throat]
No, uh, no. It's not.

21:11.401 --> 21:15.321
The hardest part is when people forget their
card, because then I look like the idiot.

21:15.447 --> 21:17.490
All right. Let's do it again.
We really have to go.

21:17.615 --> 21:21.244
You think I like this? I'm sorry.
Here. I'm gonna teach you one, okay?

21:21.327 --> 21:23.247
On the count of three,
just grab this. You ready?

21:23.329 --> 21:25.248
Put your hand out.
Okay.

21:25.331 --> 21:27.792
One, two, three.
There it is.

No. What was that?
Wow.
