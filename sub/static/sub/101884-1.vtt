02:57.430 --> 02:58.450
- Thank you sir.

02:58.450 --> 02:59.950
God bless America.

03:02.230 --> 03:03.996
Can you spare a brother a little change?

03:03.996 --> 03:05.618
- Here you go.

03:05.618 --> 03:08.108
- The hell, I look like
I'm trying to find a job.

03:08.108 --> 03:11.905
This is America, I need some
spendable shit, some money.

03:11.905 --> 03:14.408
You better take that on up the street.

03:14.408 --> 03:18.088
- Come on man, you just spent
the last two minutes talking

03:18.088 --> 03:21.177
to me like you're the only
one going through something.

03:21.177 --> 03:22.184
I'm just trying to help,

03:22.184 --> 03:24.648
beggars can't be choosers.
- Beggar?

03:24.648 --> 03:26.819
Who the hell is begging?

03:26.819 --> 03:30.600
Look, I'm not about to sit
out here and argue with you.

03:30.600 --> 03:32.744
I just lost my job last week,

03:32.744 --> 03:34.964
and you're out her begging for money.

03:34.964 --> 03:36.325
You act like you're the only one going

03:36.325 --> 03:37.498
through some shit.

03:37.498 --> 03:40.288
I got to go home and tell
my wife that we broke.

03:40.288 --> 03:41.668
While you sit out here on your ass,

03:41.668 --> 03:45.554
and beg people for
their hard earned money.

03:45.554 --> 03:48.628
Man you better take this
paper and humble yourself.

03:48.628 --> 03:50.772
- Thank you ma'am, God bless America.

03:50.772 --> 03:51.953
Now repeat that long ass,

03:51.953 --> 03:53.101
you don't know the hell you talking

03:53.101 --> 03:55.295
about shit you just said.

03:55.295 --> 03:56.883
- So you mean to tell me

03:56.883 --> 03:58.893
that could just walk up here and give you

03:58.893 --> 04:00.707
their hard earned money,

04:00.707 --> 04:02.707
'cause you asked for it?

04:04.979 --> 04:07.607
- Nigga, what the hell
you think you doing?

04:07.607 --> 04:09.238
- I'm about to sit out here with you,

04:09.238 --> 04:10.859
and ask for some money.

04:10.859 --> 04:14.163
Besides, I can make a little
bit more money with my looks.

04:14.163 --> 04:17.055
- You don't even want these problems.

04:17.055 --> 04:18.555
- You got a gun?

04:18.555 --> 04:20.687
- Like I said, you don't
even want these problems,

04:20.687 --> 04:22.007
so go on and get the hell up out of here.

04:22.007 --> 04:23.835
You ain't finna mess with my money.

04:23.835 --> 04:25.155
- Okay, I'm from the streets too.

04:25.155 --> 04:26.551
I'll be back.

04:26.551 --> 04:30.968
- I'm from the streets too,
I'm known on the streets.

04:32.244 --> 04:34.483
- Look ma'am.
- I am not a ma'am,

04:34.483 --> 04:36.087
I am a sir.

04:36.087 --> 04:39.073
Did you even finish high school?

04:39.073 --> 04:41.415
- Do you have a pen or pencil available?

04:41.415 --> 04:45.641
- Yes, thank you.
- Good, 444 dribble drive.

04:45.641 --> 04:48.460
- [Caller] What is this, this
isn't a confirmation number.

04:48.460 --> 04:50.431
- No, it's a confirmation address.

04:50.431 --> 04:52.171
So you can bring your punk ass over here,

04:52.171 --> 04:53.224
and say that same shit that
you just said to my face.

04:53.224 --> 04:55.521
- Excuse me?
- 'Cause obviously

04:55.521 --> 04:58.203
you've got some shit you need
to get off your damn chest.

04:58.203 --> 05:00.081
- [Caller] Excuse me,
this is unacceptable.

05:00.081 --> 05:02.238
- No, what's unacceptable is you taking

05:02.238 --> 05:03.949
your white privilege to the max?

05:03.949 --> 05:07.237
Look, don't let Donald
Trump get you fucked up.

05:07.237 --> 05:10.221
- [Caller] For your FYI, I am black-

05:10.221 --> 05:11.765
- Don't be trying to
change the damn subject.

05:11.765 --> 05:14.105
We not talking about
no damn black essence.

05:14.105 --> 05:18.022
- [Caller] Ma'am, I said
I am of black descent.

05:18.941 --> 05:21.037
- So you're like the Oreo type,

05:21.037 --> 05:22.461
you know chocolate on the outside,

05:22.461 --> 05:24.305
a little cream filling.

05:24.305 --> 05:26.086
Okay.
- How did you

05:26.086 --> 05:28.025
even get this job?

05:28.025 --> 05:30.379
- How you make your voice sound like that?

05:30.379 --> 05:31.212
- [Caller] I mean seriously,

05:31.212 --> 05:32.677
how did you get this job?

05:32.677 --> 05:33.649
- No, I mean seriously,

05:33.649 --> 05:35.825

voice sound like that?

05:35.825 --> 05:38.225
Could you say fuck you
nigga in that voice,

05:38.225 --> 05:42.097
'cause that shit right there
is gonna be funny as hell.

05:42.097 --> 05:44.930
I wanna record it too.
- Excuse me.

05:47.284 --> 05:50.557
- So now you can't hear.
- Who is your superior?

05:50.557 --> 05:52.549
'Cause your impulsive attitude,

05:52.549 --> 05:54.303
I know it is not acceptable.

05:54.303 --> 05:56.266
You can't talk to me that way.
- You know what?

05:56.266 --> 06:00.308
You right, I'm not taking my
black privilege to the max.

06:00.308 --> 06:01.477
Let me just get you these fees,

06:01.477 --> 06:06.477
so you can get on off my line,
'cause you're worrying me.

06:06.545 --> 06:08.348
Okay, you said you traveled to Tokyo,

06:08.348 --> 06:10.848
you're making some good money.

06:12.173 --> 06:14.756
Okay, that's gonna be 4,600.23.

06:17.033 --> 06:18.669
How do you wanna pay, debit or credit?

06:18.669 --> 06:20.893
- [Caller] Ms. McCall,

06:20.893 --> 06:23.577

06:23.577 --> 06:25.693

company are no longer needed.

06:25.693 --> 06:28.074
- Hello Rita, what are

06:28.074 --> 06:31.287
You can't touch this,

06:58.566 --> 07:00.524

07:00.524 --> 07:03.002

You just called

07:03.835 --> 07:05.752

07:06.590 --> 07:09.574
- [Caller] That can't be tolerated.

07:09.574 --> 07:13.327
- So I can't get a write up, or a warning.

07:13.327 --> 07:16.024
- [Caller] Thank you

07:16.024 --> 07:18.606
We will send your last check by mail.

07:18.606 --> 07:19.523
- You ain't been down,

07:19.523 --> 07:21.955

07:21.955 --> 07:24.382
Gone keep depositing my damn check.

07:24.382 --> 07:28.412
Don't start trying to send

07:28.412 --> 07:30.613
- [Caller] I'm really sorry.

07:30.613 --> 07:34.696
- You are sorry, you're
not giving me my job back.

07:34.696 --> 07:36.048
What the fuck.

07:36.048 --> 07:37.215
What the hell.

07:45.708 --> 07:48.272
Hey, hey, hey, what the hell is you doing?

07:48.272 --> 07:49.377
- Is this your car ma'am?

07:49.377 --> 07:50.312
- Is this your mama car.

07:50.312 --> 07:51.572
It's in my yard, ain't it?

07:51.572 --> 07:53.132
- I'm repoing this vehicle.

07:53.132 --> 07:54.366
Would you like to get
your items out of the car?

07:54.366 --> 07:56.512
- No, I would like for
you to put my car down,

07:56.512 --> 08:00.485
and bag your ass up away
from my damn and house.

08:00.485 --> 08:02.604
Look, look, take this.

08:02.604 --> 08:04.228
Yeah, girl I cannot believe
this car is doing this again.

08:04.228 --> 08:06.084
- Lady, what the hell
is you talking about?

08:06.084 --> 08:07.092
- Hey Tracy.
- Hey.

08:07.092 --> 08:09.277
- [Pauletta] I see they
repossessing your car.

08:09.277 --> 08:10.900
- Oh honey you're seeing wrong baby.

08:10.900 --> 08:13.101
No, my car just had a transmission issue,

08:13.101 --> 08:14.352
and I'm just getting this young man

08:14.352 --> 08:15.804
to take it on out of here.

08:15.804 --> 08:17.892
- I was just telling Paul the other night.

08:17.892 --> 08:20.500
I said, "Paul, those cars are not worth

08:20.500 --> 08:22.936
"the money they charge."

08:22.936 --> 08:24.382
- I feel like I got
some of the hottest cars

08:24.382 --> 08:26.664
in the neighborhood, so I disagree.

08:26.664 --> 08:28.180
- You're so right.

08:28.180 --> 08:29.843
People try to keep up with the Jones',

08:29.843 --> 08:31.196
but can't even afford to keep up

08:31.196 --> 08:32.844
with the cost of these cars.

08:32.844 --> 08:36.006
So Ms.McCall, if you don't mind,

08:36.006 --> 08:37.792
could you go in the house
and get me the keys,

08:37.792 --> 08:39.848
so I can get this beauty
on over to the shop.

08:39.848 --> 08:41.288
- Could you please excuse me

08:41.288 --> 08:44.932
while I get this young
specimen the keys to the car.

08:44.932 --> 08:47.184
Your card please, thank you.

08:47.184 --> 08:50.664
- I'ma pray for your car to
have a speedy recovery, Tracy.

08:50.664 --> 08:54.164
- Thank you.
(phone rings)

08:58.071 --> 08:59.740
- Gotcha Towing.
- You think I didn't catch

08:59.740 --> 09:01.898
that slick ass shit that you just said.

09:01.898 --> 09:03.405
Look, you just put that damn money

09:03.405 --> 09:05.200
that I gave you up under that damn mat.

09:05.200 --> 09:08.301
And you bag your ass
up out of my damn yard.

09:08.301 --> 09:10.687
- Look, I already got
the car on the lever.

09:10.687 --> 09:13.284
I don't need your
permission to take the car.

09:13.284 --> 09:16.072
It'll be in your best interest
to bring the keys on out.

09:16.072 --> 09:19.363
Or matter of fact, I can
tell your nosy neighbor,

09:19.363 --> 09:21.812
your car being repoed.

09:21.812 --> 09:24.616
- Tell her, I don't give a fuck.

09:24.616 --> 09:29.616
Look, you just bag your ass
up away from my damn car.

09:29.640 --> 09:31.456
Matter of fact, you
better put double locks

09:31.456 --> 09:32.880
on that damn fence.

09:32.880 --> 09:34.292
- Is that a threat?

09:34.292 --> 09:36.862
- Oh no, I ain't making no
threats, I make promises.

09:36.862 --> 09:38.332
- Thanks for the tip ma'am.

09:38.332 --> 09:39.606
- Tip my ass.

09:39.606 --> 09:42.189
(upbeat music)

09:44.948 --> 09:46.552
- How are you doing today?

09:46.552 --> 09:49.900
- Oh, I'm blessed and highly favored.

09:49.900 --> 09:52.540
- So I see, you are a
good Christian woman.

09:52.540 --> 09:54.291
Can you take this ticket back,

09:54.291 --> 09:56.860
and act like this never happened?

09:56.860 --> 09:59.027
- Hell no, absolutely not.

10:01.628 --> 10:02.878
No way in hell.

10:03.958 --> 10:06.840
And you can kiss my no ass.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.875
- I guess that's a no.

10:08.875 --> 10:09.931
You sit up here,

10:09.931 --> 10:13.847
and act like you don't see me
parking right here every day,

10:13.847 --> 10:17.741
and you care to give me
the same ticket every day.

10:17.741 --> 10:20.260
Aren't you tired of harassing me?

10:20.260 --> 10:22.447
- I'm glad you asked.

10:22.447 --> 10:24.115
I don't get tired.

10:24.115 --> 10:27.948
As a matter of fact, I
can go for a long time.

10:28.854 --> 10:31.659
You see, I'm not a Christian,

10:31.659 --> 10:33.623
and I'm not a Catholic.

10:33.623 --> 10:35.407
I'm a spiritual baby,

10:35.407 --> 10:37.315
and you sir have been parking

10:37.315 --> 10:39.667
in this loading zone for two weeks.

10:39.667 --> 10:41.887
So since you wanna break the law,

10:41.887 --> 10:44.464
I'm here to enforce it.

10:44.464 --> 10:47.283
'Cause this job, is my job.

10:47.283 --> 10:49.218
The job that pays my bills,

10:49.218 --> 10:53.635
and I am not about to lose
my job for your black ass.

10:54.863 --> 10:59.196
- Okay, so obviously you're
enforcing the law wrong.

11:01.041 --> 11:04.124
You give me the same ticket every day

11:05.254 --> 11:06.953
with your bad eye sight.

11:06.953 --> 11:08.977
- I don't care if you tear it up,

11:08.977 --> 11:11.137
I don't give a rabbit's ass.

11:11.137 --> 11:14.301
Plus, you just got yourself a boot.

11:14.301 --> 11:17.468
Now do you need me to call you a taxi?

11:18.333 --> 11:20.120
- Come on man.

11:20.120 --> 11:21.370
Damn man, shit.

11:22.837 --> 11:24.254
- You can't catch a break for shit.

11:24.254 --> 11:26.746
Here goes $10, I met
my quarter for the day.

11:26.746 --> 11:28.847
$75, my people will get that off.

11:28.847 --> 11:30.889
- Come on man, you know
I ain't got no $75.

11:30.889 --> 11:33.513
- I don't wanna hear that victim shit.

11:33.513 --> 11:35.371
Broke is a mind state.

11:35.371 --> 11:38.704
Get that $75, you know where to find me.

11:41.373 --> 11:43.206
- Paul, is that smoke?

11:46.502 --> 11:48.335
Paul, Paul.
- Yes dear.

11:50.869 --> 11:54.917
- Is that smoke coming out of that window?

11:54.917 --> 11:57.005
- I don't know dear.

11:57.005 --> 11:59.913
- Do you think I should
call the fire department?

11:59.913 --> 12:03.093
- No, I think we should
just stay out of it.

12:03.093 --> 12:05.737
- No, I'm calling the fire department.

12:05.737 --> 12:08.065
- Well look, why don't you
just go knock on the door,

12:08.065 --> 12:11.573
and make sure before you
call the authorities.

12:11.573 --> 12:15.490
- You know what, you
absolutely right, come on.

12:18.443 --> 12:21.292
- I think you should just
go handle this alone.

12:21.292 --> 12:23.042

13:43.499 --> 13:46.437
I'm calling for help, hold on.

13:46.437 --> 13:49.020
(upbeat music)

13:51.871 --> 13:54.288
- I need the fire department.

13:56.884 --> 13:58.467
Oh Lord Paul, Paul.

14:01.611 --> 14:05.223
She was over there just
laying on the floors shaking.

14:05.223 --> 14:07.111
I think she's dead.

14:07.111 --> 14:10.361
Told you my instincts are always right.

14:11.235 --> 14:13.391
That's the fire department right now.

14:13.391 --> 14:16.383
Come on let's go, I got to conduct this.

14:16.383 --> 14:18.527
(phone rings)

14:18.527 --> 14:21.516
- Look, Shirleen's calling.

14:21.516 --> 14:23.759
- Tell Shirleen I'll talk to her later,

14:23.759 --> 14:26.935
I'm conducting God's business right now.

14:26.935 --> 14:28.185
I said come on.

14:29.503 --> 14:32.086
(upbeat music)

14:42.894 --> 14:45.181
- Pauletta, what you done
did, what's going on?

14:45.181 --> 14:47.270
- It's your wife, go on tell him.

14:47.270 --> 14:48.919
- Is this your home sir?
- Yes sir.

14:48.919 --> 14:50.858
- We got a call reporting smoke inside.

14:50.858 --> 14:52.898
- I called them.

14:52.898 --> 14:54.850
They were about to bust your door down,

14:54.850 --> 14:56.850
hurry up and open it up.

14:58.222 --> 15:01.222
Hurry.
- Tricia girl, what you doing?

15:04.402 --> 15:05.387
- What the hell is y'all doing?

15:05.387 --> 15:07.136
I was down here stretching.

15:07.136 --> 15:08.350
- Where is the fire?

15:08.350 --> 15:10.104
I know I saw smoke.

15:10.104 --> 15:10.937
- It was sage,

15:10.937 --> 15:13.563
it was supposed to keep
the damn bad spirits away.

15:13.563 --> 15:15.619
I see shit don't work.

15:15.619 --> 15:17.343
- False alarm, let's go.

15:17.343 --> 15:19.260
- I'm so sorry, my bad.

15:21.439 --> 15:23.552
But better safe than sorry.

15:23.552 --> 15:26.823
Oh Trace, I'm so glad you're okay,

15:26.823 --> 15:29.211
you got me all scared.

15:29.211 --> 15:31.849
Honey, I saw smoke coming out of here,

15:31.849 --> 15:33.650
and I rushed over here.

15:33.650 --> 15:36.783
Honey, looked in, saw you on the ground,

15:36.783 --> 15:38.852
and my heart just dropped.

15:38.852 --> 15:41.930
I'm so glad you're alive though.

15:41.930 --> 15:42.763
- Well you know what?

15:42.763 --> 15:43.752
Good looking out, honey.

15:43.752 --> 15:46.333
But I got some Tortio's
pizza rolls in the oven.

15:46.333 --> 15:48.537
So I wouldn't want to burn the house down.

15:48.537 --> 15:50.604
But you know, Paul's
waiting for you, right?

15:50.604 --> 15:53.425
Yeah, let's go over there,
Paul get to you, right?

15:53.425 --> 15:55.592
- Okay.
- I appreciate you.

15:56.557 --> 15:58.534
Thank you coming by.

15:58.534 --> 16:00.009
(Tracy mumbles)

16:00.009 --> 16:01.537
- Tracy, what's this?

16:01.537 --> 16:03.112
I thought you said you
stopped smoking weed.

16:03.112 --> 16:05.005
- That was some stash
that I had from last year,

16:05.005 --> 16:07.433
I done smoke three of
them, the shit must be old.

16:07.433 --> 16:08.529
And the way my been going,

16:08.529 --> 16:10.437
look tell me what your day been like?

16:10.437 --> 16:11.545
- My day was crazy too,

16:11.545 --> 16:13.357
but you don't see me turning to drugs.

16:13.357 --> 16:16.059
And you trying to hide it
with this sick and ass sage.

16:16.059 --> 16:17.573
- Oh, ain't you to innocent one,

16:17.573 --> 16:18.686
while you sit at the library,

16:18.686 --> 16:20.741
acting like you had a job.

16:20.741 --> 16:22.705
- Library, who said I was at the library?

16:22.705 --> 16:24.777
I've been at Starbucks all day.

16:24.777 --> 16:27.789
- Okay, Starbucks, library,
or whatever you call it.

16:27.789 --> 16:29.931
Look, I need you to take
me to go get my car back.

16:29.931 --> 16:31.198
- Get your car back?

16:31.198 --> 16:32.427
Where's your car?

16:32.427 --> 16:35.025
- They repoed it today,
over one late payment.

16:35.025 --> 16:36.205
- Did you get your stuff out?

16:36.205 --> 16:39.299
No I didn't, 'cause the
nosy neighbor was watching.

16:39.299 --> 16:40.455
- Come on, man.

16:40.455 --> 16:42.749
I bet you if you had your
Tina Turner wigs in the car,

16:42.749 --> 16:44.617
you wouldn't forget that out.

16:44.617 --> 16:45.450
- Ain't you funny?

16:45.450 --> 16:47.568
Let's talk about where you're car at?

16:47.568 --> 16:49.818
- My shit got a boot on it.

16:50.661 --> 16:55.220
- Meanwhile you at Starbucks
drinking coffee huh?

16:55.220 --> 16:57.693
So tell me how you paying for
all that Starbucks coffee?

16:57.693 --> 16:59.551
- With your Starbucks rewards card.

16:59.551 --> 17:01.968
- I don't have a reward card.

17:03.110 --> 17:05.821
- Oh shit.
- What is it?

17:05.821 --> 17:06.983
- Look, that's the sheriff.

17:06.983 --> 17:08.155
What he doing?

17:08.155 --> 17:10.031
What he doing over here?

17:10.031 --> 17:12.079
- What, let him in.
- He coming here.

17:12.079 --> 17:13.793
Don't let him in.
- He probably wanna talk

17:13.793 --> 17:16.178
to me about those parking tickets.

17:16.178 --> 17:17.699
- So, he ain't coming over here,

17:17.699 --> 17:18.915
you are no reason to come here.

17:18.915 --> 17:20.594
Not over a damn car.

17:20.594 --> 17:22.330
What do you say?

17:22.330 --> 17:23.168
(door bell rings)

17:23.168 --> 17:26.001
- This is-
- Hi, I'm Miss Pauletta,

17:27.311 --> 17:28.728
I live next door.

17:30.257 --> 17:32.723
Wonder why they ain't
answering their door.

17:32.723 --> 17:34.310
- Maybe they ain't home, I'll
come back in the morning.

17:34.310 --> 17:37.390
- No, no, they went in there
right before you pulled up.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.640
Tracy, Tracy, just hold on.

17:42.266 --> 17:44.066
They're in there.

17:44.066 --> 17:47.214
Tracy, the authorities is out here.

17:47.214 --> 17:49.381
- Ma'am I can handle this.

17:50.253 --> 17:51.753
- Okay, excuse me.

17:54.060 --> 17:57.002
But before you came, we had
to have a fire truck here,

17:57.002 --> 17:59.623
we thought the house was on fire.

17:59.623 --> 18:01.206
And Tracy was dead.

18:04.740 --> 18:07.407
Wait a minute, why are you here?

18:08.778 --> 18:10.199
Is something wrong?

18:10.199 --> 18:12.209
Is something going on?

18:12.209 --> 18:15.915
- Respectfully ma'am, that's
none of your business.

18:15.915 --> 18:20.190
- I respect that, but
since I'm a child of God,

18:20.190 --> 18:22.903
I look at them like they're my family.

18:22.903 --> 18:25.515
And I wanna do things right by them.

18:25.515 --> 18:28.123
You've got something
you need for me to sign,

18:28.123 --> 18:30.456
I can make sure they get it.

18:33.760 --> 18:36.951
- God I'm so glad I looked out the window.

18:36.951 --> 18:38.756
What's going on?

18:38.756 --> 18:41.786
- I told him they was in there.

18:41.786 --> 18:43.091
- I bet you did.

18:43.091 --> 18:44.667
- What's going on?

18:44.667 --> 18:46.551
- Babe, can you take Pauletta over there,

18:46.551 --> 18:48.439
and tell her about that
party that we was planning

18:48.439 --> 18:50.435
on having for the new neighbors.

18:50.435 --> 18:52.743
- What party?
- The party,

18:52.743 --> 18:53.902
you remember that?
- Oh that party.

18:53.902 --> 18:54.735
Oh yeah Pauletta,

18:54.735 --> 18:56.512
maybe you can be the DJ.

18:56.512 --> 18:59.947
- Yeah, she'll like that.
- Really, I never DJ'd before.

18:59.947 --> 19:00.780
- [Tracy] Yeah, she'll like that.

19:00.780 --> 19:03.363
- But I got some Cherly Season records.

19:03.363 --> 19:04.978
That might would work.

19:04.978 --> 19:07.139
But hey, don't you wanna see

19:07.139 --> 19:09.208
what the Sheriff want with your wife?

19:09.208 --> 19:11.112
- No, she got that covered.

19:11.112 --> 19:12.011
- I'm Tracy McCall, what's going on?

19:12.011 --> 19:14.304
- Tracy McCall, okay.

19:14.304 --> 19:16.464
Unfortunately, the bank is
foreclosing on your property,

19:16.464 --> 19:19.524
I'm just here to make sure
you have the paperwork.

19:19.524 --> 19:21.044
- You serious?
- Yeah, if you can come up

19:21.044 --> 19:23.488
with all the money to
bring out a foreclosure,

19:23.488 --> 19:25.405
that will satisfy that.

19:26.965 --> 19:30.264
Sounds nice what you're
doing for your neighbors.

19:30.264 --> 19:31.876
Hope that all works out for you.

19:31.876 --> 19:33.543
- [Tracy] Thank you.

19:37.320 --> 19:40.052
- The sheriff just gave
your wife a piece of paper.

19:40.052 --> 19:41.912
I hope she's okay.

19:41.912 --> 19:43.440
- Yeah, it might be about her law suit.

19:43.440 --> 19:45.600
- She's suing somebody?

19:45.600 --> 19:47.715
Well I hope she wins.

19:47.715 --> 19:50.037
- Yeah.
- You know what,

19:50.037 --> 19:51.856
I can play a little Barry White,

19:51.856 --> 19:53.672
and some Kirk Franklin.

19:53.672 --> 19:54.870
That will allow the people

19:54.870 --> 19:56.580
to get their little twerk laid on.

19:56.580 --> 19:59.344
Well how about you don't
have a set date yet,

19:59.344 --> 20:01.712
but I email you, and let you know.

20:01.712 --> 20:03.629
- Oh, that sounds good.

20:04.968 --> 20:08.988
Hey, but you don't have my email address.

20:08.988 --> 20:12.238
- Babe, what the sheriff talking about?

20:13.188 --> 20:14.988
- He said we about the lose the house.

20:14.988 --> 20:17.295
So you didn't make last two
payments that I gave you?

20:17.295 --> 20:19.564
So you're trying to tell
me we could lose our house

20:19.564 --> 20:22.172
over a few late payments.

20:22.172 --> 20:26.284
- Yes, so what did you do with the money?

20:26.284 --> 20:29.808
- Look, the boss tried to say,
I tried to hit on his wife.

20:29.808 --> 20:32.628
- So did you?
- Hell no, I told him

20:32.628 --> 20:33.692
that I got a woman.

20:33.692 --> 20:37.412
And the next thing you
know, I was laid off.

20:37.412 --> 20:41.267
- So again, what did
you do with the money?

20:41.267 --> 20:42.932
- Why you got to have an attitude?

20:42.932 --> 20:45.976
I can't talk to you
when you act like that.

20:45.976 --> 20:48.812
So you seriously telling
not to have attitude.

20:48.812 --> 20:50.235
We about to lose the house.

20:50.235 --> 20:53.656
I can't make normal
payment plans, that's it?

20:53.656 --> 20:56.596
And if we don't have the money, we out.

20:56.596 --> 20:59.011
- You know I don't like when
you keep smoking all that weed.

20:59.011 --> 21:00.705
- And you know I don't care.

21:00.705 --> 21:02.956
So again, what did you do with the money?

21:02.956 --> 21:04.264
- You know that guy Richard,

21:04.264 --> 21:06.736
won a million dollars
playing scratch offs.

21:06.736 --> 21:08.340
I just did what he did.

21:08.340 --> 21:11.090
- So $6,000 worth of scratch off?

21:11.984 --> 21:13.528
Did you win anything?

21:13.528 --> 21:15.104
- How many of those you gonna smoke?

21:15.104 --> 21:17.760
- $6,000 worth.
- I can't talk to you

21:17.760 --> 21:19.123
when you act like that.

21:19.123 --> 21:23.358
- You know what, we need
to just call it quits.

21:23.358 --> 21:24.334
You ain't helping me,

21:24.334 --> 21:25.815
and obviously I ain't helping you.

21:25.815 --> 21:27.828
And we blaming each other.

21:27.828 --> 21:30.378
We just need to let this
whole relationship go.

21:30.378 --> 21:31.756
This is ridiculous.

21:31.756 --> 21:34.266
We don't need to be together no more.

21:34.266 --> 21:35.210
- Sorry.
- If we're gonna lose it,

21:35.210 --> 21:36.828
let's lose it all.

21:36.828 --> 21:38.074
- Every time you smoke weed,

21:38.074 --> 21:40.520
you start acting all crazy and shit.

21:40.520 --> 21:43.010
You act like you don't believe
in papa bear or something.

21:43.010 --> 21:45.830
I told you that you gotta
believe in papa bear.

21:45.830 --> 21:47.885
When you weak, I'm strong.

21:47.885 --> 21:50.240
And when I'm weak, you strong.

21:50.240 --> 21:52.823
Team work makes the dream work.

21:54.202 --> 21:58.285
I told you I got a plan,
you gotta believe in me.

23:16.946 --> 23:19.706
No ma'am, it's an Uber driver ma'am.

23:19.706 --> 23:21.730
- Well you know what?

23:21.730 --> 23:24.327
They did pick up Tracy's car yesterday,

23:24.327 --> 23:26.693
saying the transmission went in.

23:26.693 --> 23:28.707
At least that's what she told me.

23:28.707 --> 23:30.147
She was devastated.

23:30.147 --> 23:33.173
I told her them cars
ain't built right no way.

23:33.173 --> 23:38.023
She needs a Mana, no that
a real car right there,

23:38.023 --> 23:40.493
but thank God for the upper drivers.

23:40.493 --> 23:42.410
- Uber.
- Say, Seven car

23:45.475 --> 23:46.975

23:48.323 --> 23:50.783
How do you know Seven and Tracy again?

23:50.783 --> 23:53.139
- Ma'am, I gotta take this
phone call for a minute.

23:53.139 --> 23:54.579
- I ain't hear no phone ring.

23:54.579 --> 23:56.579
- It's on vibrate ma'am.

24:06.039 --> 24:08.139
You can't trust everybody pulling in.

24:08.139 --> 24:09.235
- No you can't.

24:09.235 --> 24:12.255

You take care upper driver.

24:28.263 --> 24:32.346
Paul, Paul, Paul it's

24:34.246 --> 24:35.839
- What's wrong dear?

24:35.839 --> 24:38.893
- Wonder why Tracy
didn't ask me for a ride?

24:38.893 --> 24:40.813
We got two cars out there,

24:40.813 --> 24:43.709
and she didn't even consider me.

24:43.709 --> 24:46.349
Do you think Tracy's jealous of me.

24:46.349 --> 24:47.849
- Yes honey.
- Why?

24:49.273 --> 24:52.873
- Why what?
- Why is Tracy jealous of me?

24:52.873 --> 24:55.269
I know the people at
the church are jealous,

24:55.269 --> 25:00.269
especially that old Bertha,
she don't wear no stockings.

25:00.430 --> 25:03.105
Thank God all she has to
do is put some lard grease

25:03.105 --> 25:05.341
on that leg, and it's all good.

25:05.341 --> 25:09.149
That skin be still looking
something kind of dry.

25:09.149 --> 25:14.149
And Therma, oh that Therma
looking at me on overtime.

25:14.237 --> 25:18.098
You ought to see how he
watch me when I'm walking.

25:18.098 --> 25:20.807
If I wasn't a child of God,

25:20.807 --> 25:24.307
he probably try to touch my golden splash.

25:27.727 --> 25:30.051
Did you hear that?

25:30.051 --> 25:33.127
I said something about my golden splash,

25:33.127 --> 25:34.627
and heard a mourn.

25:36.907 --> 25:38.324
Now that's weird.

25:41.931 --> 25:43.327
- Which bank we hitting up?

25:43.327 --> 25:45.290

25:46.403 --> 25:47.275
- Why are you talking so loud,

25:47.275 --> 25:48.108

25:48.108 --> 25:50.441
- Let's just go, get on out.

25:53.815 --> 25:54.815
- Thank you.

26:02.459 --> 26:04.738
- Yeah babe, put it on paper.

26:04.738 --> 26:06.879
(Seven whispers)

26:06.879 --> 26:08.991
- Hi, you want my ID?

26:08.991 --> 26:09.908
- No ma'am.

26:15.983 --> 26:17.767
- What you waiting for, move.

26:17.767 --> 26:18.861

26:19.942 --> 26:20.875
- Position for what?

26:20.875 --> 26:22.691

26:22.691 --> 26:23.696
- Babe, no I came up here

26:23.696 --> 26:25.795

26:25.795 --> 26:27.563
What made you think I'm robbing the bank?

26:27.563 --> 26:29.183
- You said we was gone hit up the bank,

26:29.183 --> 26:30.939
and if you fail, I fall.

26:30.939 --> 26:32.815
I said, " No, I'll take the fall."

26:32.815 --> 26:35.363
- Babe, no, that was for me
to withdraw my money out,

26:35.363 --> 26:37.551
and if I get some late
fees, I'ma take care of it.

26:37.551 --> 26:38.994
- Freeze.
- Oh hey, hey.

She's been banking with us for some years.

27:44.930 --> 27:47.974
But today she closed all her accounts.

27:47.974 --> 27:51.288

her account information

27:51.288 --> 27:53.871
over to my desk, please?

28:24.939 --> 28:29.106
Good, set it up.
(speaker mumbles)

28:48.332 --> 28:51.593
- Get your ass back down nigga.

28:51.593 --> 28:54.572
- I hate it when people steal from me.

28:54.572 --> 28:56.476
And you my friend should have always known

28:56.476 --> 28:58.143
that I hate a thief.

28:59.098 --> 29:00.606
- Hi, my name is Teresa McCall.

29:00.606 --> 29:04.072
My car was impounded in Bronca yesterday.

29:04.072 --> 29:06.655
- Yes, Mercedes-Benz>
- Correct.

29:07.725 --> 29:10.308
- That's $4,243.80.
- Excuse me.

29:12.903 --> 29:14.486
- That's $4,243.80,

29:16.921 --> 29:18.888
and 200 that is an impound fee.

29:18.888 --> 29:19.820
- I heard you the first time.

29:19.820 --> 29:21.380
Why my bill is so high?

29:21.380 --> 29:23.761
- Because I was informed that
you have to pay the total cost

29:23.761 --> 29:25.084
of your car loan amount,

29:25.084 --> 29:26.720
before you can get your vehicle.

29:26.720 --> 29:27.796
- And who informed you of this?

29:27.796 --> 29:28.940
- That's on a need to know basis.

29:28.940 --> 29:29.988
- I need to know right now,

29:29.988 --> 29:31.008
'cause they can't do that.

29:31.008 --> 29:32.508
- Look, I'm just doing my job.

29:32.508 --> 29:35.091
- Can I get the invoice please?

29:37.444 --> 29:38.921
- Look, stop playing around with me,

29:38.921 --> 29:40.375
and go get my damn car.

29:40.375 --> 29:42.985
- Ms. McCall you're
acting way out of line.

29:42.985 --> 29:44.201
I suggest that if there's a problem,

29:44.201 --> 29:47.409
you take it up with the people
that gave you your car loan.

29:47.409 --> 29:50.425
- Look, could you please
understand my situation?

29:50.425 --> 29:52.182
I really do need my car.

29:52.182 --> 29:53.904
Woman to woman, please understand.

29:53.904 --> 29:55.197
- I can understand that.

29:55.197 --> 29:57.325
And I wish there was
something I can do to help,

29:57.325 --> 29:58.677
but Karma's a bitch.

29:58.677 --> 30:00.325
That was my husband that you went off on,

30:00.325 --> 30:02.992
and he was simply doing his job.

30:04.537 --> 30:05.637
- That was your husband, huh?

30:05.637 --> 30:08.137
- Yep, and thanks for the tip.

30:18.569 --> 30:19.486
- Let's go.

30:22.365 --> 30:23.489
- What about your car?

30:23.489 --> 30:25.408
My weights in the car.

30:25.408 --> 30:26.998
- They said I got to pay $4,000

30:26.998 --> 30:28.633
in order to get the car back.

30:28.633 --> 30:30.133
- So they're not accepting your payment?

30:30.133 --> 30:33.029
- No, they want the whole payment in full.

30:33.029 --> 30:34.501
- Man, they can't do that shit.

30:34.501 --> 30:36.961
- They can do what the hell they want to.

30:36.961 --> 30:40.092
- Man, I'm tired of all this
shit hitting us all at once.

30:40.092 --> 30:42.001
Why is this shit happening?

30:42.001 --> 30:42.961
- Let's just go.

30:42.961 --> 30:44.361
Please, let's just go.

30:44.361 --> 30:47.278
(car engine roars)

30:54.519 --> 30:55.601
I can't believe what's going on,

30:55.601 --> 30:57.596
when it rains, it really pours.

30:57.596 --> 30:58.929
I mean for real.

30:59.997 --> 31:01.254
- Hey, stop the car.

31:01.254 --> 31:02.087
- Stop the car?

31:02.087 --> 31:03.521
What are we stopping the car for?

31:03.521 --> 31:04.885
- Babe, we going to church.

31:04.885 --> 31:06.385
- Babe, I got to get to the house.

31:06.385 --> 31:07.218
I see the church,

31:07.218 --> 31:08.470

31:08.470 --> 31:09.581
Baby, come on now.

31:39.563 --> 31:43.586
Yes, I'd like to thank

(audience claps)

31:54.663 --> 31:56.858
(Tracy mumbles)

31:56.858 --> 31:58.222
- Before we get into the word of God,

31:58.222 --> 32:00.339
is there anyone that
would like to stand up.

32:00.339 --> 32:02.172
They haven't been here,
and introduced theirselves.

32:02.172 --> 32:03.973
- Stand up and introduce yourself.

32:03.973 --> 32:06.566
- No, you stand up, this was your idea.

32:06.566 --> 32:08.861
- Look we need to introduce ourselves,

32:08.861 --> 32:10.273
and ask for prayer.

32:10.273 --> 32:11.222
'Cause we gonna need it.

32:11.222 --> 32:12.274
- No you do need prayer,

32:12.274 --> 32:14.478
did you know we already
came to this church?

32:14.478 --> 32:16.864
This was the church I
gave the two vans to.

32:16.864 --> 32:17.720
- To this church?

32:17.720 --> 32:19.176
- Yes, to this church.

32:19.176 --> 32:20.376
Did you forget,

32:20.376 --> 32:22.476
matter a fact, after I gave
it to them two week later,

32:22.476 --> 32:24.500
we got approved for the house.

32:24.500 --> 32:25.833
That we're about to lose now,

32:25.833 --> 32:29.460
because you decided to go
on a scratch offs spree.

32:29.460 --> 32:30.436
- How you doing sister?

32:30.436 --> 32:31.269

32:31.269 --> 32:33.193

32:39.523 --> 32:42.688
Thank you sister Tomasita, thank you.

32:42.688 --> 32:43.932
We know it wasn't easy.

32:43.932 --> 32:44.765
Is there anyone else

32:44.765 --> 32:47.208
that would like to introduce theirselve?

32:47.208 --> 32:48.332
No?

32:48.332 --> 32:49.165
We know it's not easy,

32:49.165 --> 32:50.684
we know it's not easy to come up here.

32:50.684 --> 32:53.216
And before we go any farther,

32:53.216 --> 32:56.049
we have to take up offering, amen?

32:57.050 --> 32:58.818
- Amen.
- And you know

32:58.818 --> 33:00.148
if you sow to God's home,

33:00.148 --> 33:02.382
that God will sow into your home.

33:02.382 --> 33:05.202
- That's right.
- We also have

33:05.202 --> 33:06.670
the building fund.

33:06.670 --> 33:07.503
Don't look shocked,

33:07.503 --> 33:10.138
you know we need a new hand for the clock.

33:10.138 --> 33:12.307
Door knob for the bathroom stalls,

33:12.307 --> 33:14.982
first aid kits for the children.

33:14.982 --> 33:16.258
We'll have the deacon come around,

33:16.258 --> 33:18.550
and as the deacon comes around
with the collection plate,

33:18.550 --> 33:20.346
we're going to have brother Trench come up

33:20.346 --> 33:21.808
and lead us in song, amen?

33:21.808 --> 33:23.386
- Amen.
- Amen.

33:23.386 --> 33:26.136
(audience claps)

33:57.279 --> 33:59.915
- Oh, I wish I had a
witness in this thing.

33:59.915 --> 34:02.570
Can I hear what I come to do.

34:02.570 --> 34:04.583
Let me tell you something.

34:04.583 --> 34:07.333
Most sinners, got money for weed,

34:08.556 --> 34:10.223

34:12.231 --> 34:15.564
And some of y'all got money for bundles,

34:16.911 --> 34:21.503
and even some of y'all
may eat only once a day.

34:21.503 --> 34:23.984
Some of y'all twice a day,

34:23.984 --> 34:25.582
down there at McDonald's.

34:25.582 --> 34:29.003
And some of y'all got that paper,

34:29.003 --> 34:32.451
that your take down to the night club.

34:32.451 --> 34:33.284
If somebody say,

34:33.284 --> 34:36.054
"Well, Bob you know I
don't do no nightclubing."

34:36.054 --> 34:39.250
But I still saw get down

I think she's trying to
get him to get your job.

35:12.704 --> 35:14.403
- I thought I was the
head pastor around here.

35:14.403 --> 35:15.534
- That's what we thought.

35:15.534 --> 35:16.747
- Some better sit him back somewhere.

35:16.747 --> 35:18.943
They better set him straight
before I set him down.

35:18.943 --> 35:20.063

We just need what's in

36:06.138 --> 36:07.980
And I know things ain't easy,

36:07.980 --> 36:10.114
but you cannot fix it this way.

36:10.114 --> 36:13.066
You can't expect to break
through by stealing from God.

36:13.066 --> 36:14.614
- Look, pastor you sitting up

We need that money back,

They're gonna text us,

39:02.708 --> 39:04.836

39:04.836 --> 39:07.944
- Why didn't say that in the first place?

39:07.944 --> 39:11.871
- Oh my gosh, you've got to be kidding me.

39:11.871 --> 39:13.644
- Do you think you can get me a part?

39:13.644 --> 39:15.756
- Yes, I'll be glad to, just drive.

39:22.583 --> 39:23.603
Please, just drive.

39:23.603 --> 39:25.647

39:49.435 --> 39:50.679
Your ass is whack, okay?

39:50.679 --> 39:53.679
I need you to just stick

39:53.679 --> 39:55.196
- But your man was rocking to it.

- People rock to anything

39:56.472 --> 39:58.844
as long as the damn music is hot, okay?

39:58.844 --> 40:00.008

40:02.274 --> 40:04.376

Okay, okay, chill, I'm on it.

42:19.731 --> 42:21.262

42:21.262 --> 42:23.031
You should have said grab a gun.

42:23.896 --> 42:25.760
- Man you know you made

42:25.760 --> 42:27.560

42:34.146 --> 42:36.170

42:36.170 --> 42:38.690
- No, KidUber, you right on time.

42:38.690 --> 42:39.846
- No he's not on time.

42:39.846 --> 42:42.486
- Baby look, if those people
realize that we not blind,

42:42.486 --> 42:43.579
they could kill us.

42:43.579 --> 42:45.890

42:45.890 --> 42:47.810
- Babe, how much money did you grab?

42:47.810 --> 42:48.963

42:50.166 --> 42:52.462

42:53.507 --> 42:54.340
Where are you going?

42:54.340 --> 42:56.590
You could've stayed straight

And what the hell did your accent go?

43:03.578 --> 43:05.486
- Bro, enough of this playing.

43:05.486 --> 43:07.669
You could've stayed straight

43:07.669 --> 43:08.881
- You know what I told you,

43:08.881 --> 43:12.436
this is what happens when you
hype people up with no talent.

43:12.436 --> 43:13.877
Bro, what are you doing?

43:13.877 --> 43:14.710
- Enough talking man,

43:14.710 --> 43:16.609
I'm gonna need you to hand over that bag.

43:16.609 --> 43:17.881

43:17.881 --> 43:19.714
that's up under that chair that seeing.

43:19.714 --> 43:20.901
- Man you better go ahead and drive,

43:20.901 --> 43:23.077
before you get hit with that fiber club.

43:23.077 --> 43:23.910
- Matter of fact,

43:23.910 --> 43:25.581

43:25.581 --> 43:27.849
so we can bring your accent back.

43:27.849 --> 43:30.209
Go on start this car so we can go.

43:30.209 --> 43:31.792
- Is that the cops?

43:34.952 --> 43:37.316

43:37.316 --> 43:38.971

43:38.971 --> 43:40.408
I was afraid for my life.

43:40.408 --> 43:42.059
- Are you serious?

43:42.059 --> 43:44.651
- Officer arrest this man,
he's trying to rob us.

43:44.651 --> 43:47.440
- Officer, if you look in her bag,

43:47.440 --> 43:50.347
there's $6500 in cash, and a mask in it.

43:50.347 --> 43:52.680
- Are you serious?
- I was saving that money,

43:52.680 --> 43:54.864
I was driving to the children's hospital.

43:54.864 --> 43:57.298
I had it under my seat.

43:57.298 --> 44:00.130
I can just imagine those kid
faces man, if I don't show up.

44:00.130 --> 44:01.105
(Tracy laughs)

44:01.105 --> 44:03.701
- You could be a great
actor, for real, for real.

44:03.701 --> 44:05.199
- We have a possible 1080.

44:05.199 --> 44:06.372
- Look, you don't believe us, do you?

44:06.372 --> 44:08.682
- He's lying.

44:24.058 --> 44:26.398
Calm down, I mean damn, what the hell?

44:26.398 --> 44:27.231
- Calm down officer.

44:28.438 --> 44:30.099

44:30.099 --> 44:31.902
Tell the truth man, come on.

44:31.902 --> 44:33.814
Show him you little trigger.

44:33.814 --> 44:35.262
- I use this technology trick that I use

44:35.262 --> 44:38.634
to summon the cops in order
for me to save my life.

44:38.634 --> 44:39.987

44:39.987 --> 44:41.263
'Cause they taking us to jail.

You have the right to remain silent,

44:47.831 --> 44:50.239
anything you say can and
will be used against you

44:50.239 --> 44:51.583

45:01.047 --> 45:02.635
- Look I don't know,

45:02.635 --> 45:03.715
I don't care.

45:03.715 --> 45:06.283
All we need to do is

45:06.283 --> 45:07.482
- Well look, let's go.

45:22.943 --> 45:25.526

45:30.821 --> 45:35.571
Wait, babe go without me, keep

45:41.881 --> 45:44.631
Come on.

45:49.023 --> 45:51.834
- Seven and Tracy.
- Okay, what's wrong

45:51.834 --> 45:52.882

45:52.882 --> 45:55.549
(Tracy mumbles)

45:57.598 --> 46:01.394
- I just need one moment of your time.

46:01.394 --> 46:03.162
I was the one who bailed you out.

46:03.162 --> 46:04.842
- We didn't ask you to bail us out.

46:04.842 --> 46:06.092
- Babe come on.

46:07.066 --> 46:09.535
Good looking, let's at least
hear what the man got to say.

46:09.535 --> 46:11.140
- No.
- He is the one

46:11.140 --> 46:12.958
that bailed us out.

46:12.958 --> 46:15.086
I just need one moment.

46:15.086 --> 46:17.753
Please Ms. McCall.
- Who is this?

46:22.992 --> 46:24.585
You dying first.

46:24.585 --> 46:27.502
(incidental music)

46:37.994 --> 46:39.153
- Care for a drink?

46:39.153 --> 46:43.266
- No, I wanna know, how did

46:43.266 --> 46:45.224
- I've been watching you two.

46:45.224 --> 46:46.391
I'm impressed.

46:49.377 --> 46:50.877
I like your drive.

46:51.853 --> 46:53.853
I like your persistence.

46:54.733 --> 46:57.583
What would you say if I
told you I have the answer

46:57.583 --> 46:59.517
to all of your problems?

46:59.517 --> 47:00.885
- I don't recall knowing you,

47:00.885 --> 47:03.113
so how you know we got a problem?

47:03.113 --> 47:03.946
- Babe, stop talking.

47:03.946 --> 47:05.085
Let the man finish.

47:05.085 --> 47:09.089
- So you like our
persistence and what else?

47:09.089 --> 47:12.241
- She's right, enough small talk.

47:12.241 --> 47:14.703
My boss wants to give you
two a million dollars.

47:14.703 --> 47:15.811
- He want to give us what?

47:15.811 --> 47:16.644
- Where's it at?

47:16.644 --> 47:17.655
When can we meet him?

47:17.655 --> 47:20.311
- So tell me why your boss
wanna give us a million dollars?

47:20.311 --> 47:22.499
- Babe stop asking all them questions.

47:22.499 --> 47:23.535
- When can we meet him?

47:23.535 --> 47:24.368
You know what?

47:24.368 --> 47:25.679
I smell something fishy here.

47:25.679 --> 47:27.176
- I smell something fishy too.

47:27.176 --> 47:28.951
That new blue money.

47:28.951 --> 47:29.803
When can we get it?

47:29.803 --> 47:31.636
Can we get it in cash?

47:32.699 --> 47:34.423
- That can be arranged.

47:34.423 --> 47:36.435
- This money right here is
gonna come with a price.

47:36.435 --> 47:38.435
- Paul, Paul.
- Yes dear.

47:40.995 --> 47:44.611
- Seven and Tracy just
got out of a fancy car.

47:44.611 --> 47:47.111
Wonder what they got going on.

47:50.355 --> 47:52.078
- I don't know dear.

47:52.078 --> 47:54.661
(upbeat music)

48:08.143 --> 48:09.323
- Sir.
- Babe you hear

48:09.323 --> 48:10.911
that white man just called me sir.

48:10.911 --> 48:14.751
- Sound like he just
called your ass an old man.

48:45.908 --> 48:47.640
- I see y'all had to
take the original copy,

48:47.640 --> 48:50.011
and make a carbon copy.

48:50.011 --> 48:53.115
- Bob honey, our guest have arrived.

48:53.115 --> 48:56.459
- Seven, Tracy, so glad you could join us.

48:56.459 --> 48:58.042
Please have a seat.

Could you fix them a drink.
- Thank you.

49:03.187 --> 49:06.247
- I have the best wine, from 1810.

49:06.247 --> 49:07.327
- Oh excuse me.

49:07.327 --> 49:10.191
That wine sounds expired,
could you give me so Moscato?

49:10.191 --> 49:13.018
You need to get rid of that bottle.

49:13.018 --> 49:14.122
- I don't need anything to drink.

49:14.122 --> 49:15.667
I wanna talk about this money.

49:15.667 --> 49:16.500
- Yeah, tell us.

49:16.500 --> 49:18.411
What's the catch?

49:18.411 --> 49:21.682
- I like you two, straight to the point.

49:21.682 --> 49:25.015
Just the kind of people I'm looking for.

49:30.563 --> 49:33.067
- I'm sorry, we don't have any Moscato.

49:33.067 --> 49:36.469
- No worries.
- Honey, you can cut the act.

49:36.469 --> 49:37.883
They prefer straight forward.

49:37.883 --> 49:40.133
- Thank you, I felt so old.

49:41.040 --> 49:46.011
- My wife and I wanna give
you 1 million in cash,

49:46.011 --> 49:48.635
and all you have to do, is rob our bank.

49:48.635 --> 49:49.895
- Oh babe, let's go.

49:49.895 --> 49:50.728
Could you get you a driver

49:50.728 --> 49:52.071
to drive my black ass home?

49:52.071 --> 49:53.003
Baby let's go.

49:53.003 --> 49:54.575
- Tracy, please be advised.

49:54.575 --> 49:56.705
You have heard way too much.

49:56.705 --> 49:59.269
You don't think we're asking you now?

49:59.269 --> 50:01.181
You really believe we
will allow you to walk out

50:01.181 --> 50:02.975
after you've heard our plans?

50:02.975 --> 50:04.039
- I didn't hear shit.

50:04.039 --> 50:05.494
Could you advise your damn driver

50:05.494 --> 50:06.919
to drive my black ass home?

50:06.919 --> 50:08.991
Babe, get up let's go.

50:08.991 --> 50:10.698
- Mr. McCall-
- Babe, what are you doing?

50:10.698 --> 50:12.269
- Do we have an agreement?
- Are you serious?

50:12.269 --> 50:14.278
- Get your hands off me.

50:14.278 --> 50:15.582
- My wife can't see the big picture.

50:15.582 --> 50:16.737
Can she just hold the money for a second.

50:16.737 --> 50:18.419
- I don't need to hold shit.

50:18.419 --> 50:19.515
- Get your hand off of me.

50:19.515 --> 50:21.134
I don't need to hold shit, let's go.

50:21.134 --> 50:22.394
- Can you give us a moment please?

50:22.394 --> 50:24.363
- I don't need to touch shit.

50:24.363 --> 50:27.587
- Babe, they're using
a scare tactic on you.

50:27.587 --> 50:29.144
You freaking these white people out.

50:29.144 --> 50:31.831
This is our chance to become
millionaires overnight.

50:31.831 --> 50:34.200
- Babe, did you hear what she just said?

50:34.200 --> 50:36.767
We're not going to be
able to enjoy this money.

50:36.767 --> 50:37.983
Are you serious?

50:37.983 --> 50:41.115
Did you see the guns?
- Are you okay?

50:41.115 --> 50:42.155
- Yes, we're good.

50:42.155 --> 50:43.349
We're good.
- Babe.

50:43.349 --> 50:45.569
- So we have an agreement?
- Are you serious?

50:45.569 --> 50:46.981
- We good, we have an agreement.

50:46.981 --> 50:48.064

51:00.778 --> 51:02.069
- Baby what's wrong?

51:02.069 --> 51:03.809
Why are you not celebrating?

51:03.809 --> 51:06.317
We just hit the jackpot.

51:06.317 --> 51:08.382
We got a half a million dollars now,

51:08.382 --> 51:10.245
we get the other half later,

51:10.245 --> 51:12.421
and you act like you're
not happy about this.

51:12.421 --> 51:14.489
We in the millionaires club now.

51:14.489 --> 51:16.574
- I mean, did you not see the guns?

51:16.574 --> 51:20.249
Did you not hear the conversations?

51:20.249 --> 51:21.465
I mean, come on.

51:21.465 --> 51:24.089
They're not going to
let us enjoy that money.

51:24.089 --> 51:26.672
- Look, you draining my energy.

51:27.841 --> 51:30.001
After this, you can buy all the weed,

51:30.001 --> 51:31.921
and wigs that you wanna buy.

51:31.921 --> 51:34.185
- Come on, you got to take this serious.

51:34.185 --> 51:36.089
Did you see that guy sitting out there

51:36.089 --> 51:37.469
in front of our house?

51:37.469 --> 51:40.529
- Come on man, you've been
watching too many scary movies.

51:40.529 --> 51:43.469
You acting all paranoid and shit now.

51:43.469 --> 51:44.302

You not watching enough movies.

51:47.702 --> 51:48.702
Man come on.

51:50.207 --> 51:52.540
You gotta take this serious.

51:53.913 --> 51:55.413
But you know what?

51:56.749 --> 51:58.876
I'm gonna play alone,

51:58.876 --> 52:00.841
but we got to have our own plan.

52:00.841 --> 52:02.297
- That's what I'm talking about.

52:02.297 --> 52:05.509
Now you back to your old self again.

52:05.509 --> 52:07.053
- Yeah, get the pencil and the paper.

52:07.053 --> 52:08.886
Let's figure this out.

52:13.081 --> 52:15.829
- So babe you seriously
thought about coffee.

52:15.829 --> 52:18.537
- Yeah, got you a coffee and a mask too.

52:18.537 --> 52:19.892
- Well thank you.

52:19.892 --> 52:23.225
So driver, are y'all providing the guns?

52:25.801 --> 52:28.318
Probably not, he don't say much.

52:28.318 --> 52:29.569
He always quiet.

52:29.569 --> 52:33.213
Every time I ask a question,
he act like he don't hear me.

52:33.213 --> 52:35.806

52:45.938 --> 52:48.380
- Yes sir.
- Alright, well that's cool.

52:48.380 --> 52:51.347
- So look, can I get a
picture of you real quick?

52:51.347 --> 52:53.915
You know you've been
taking care of us, okay?

52:53.915 --> 52:56.375
Alright cool, thank you.

52:56.375 --> 52:57.515
I appreciate it.

52:57.515 --> 52:58.835
- Babe what was that all about?

52:58.835 --> 53:02.502
- Just a little collateral
damage, let's go.

53:07.278 --> 53:10.249
- Everybody get the fuck down now.

53:10.249 --> 53:12.832
- Shit man.
- Get the fuck down.

53:13.871 --> 53:14.893
(Seven mumbles)

53:14.893 --> 53:16.631
- Stay the fuck down.

53:16.631 --> 53:19.421
I told you to shut the fuck up.

53:19.421 --> 53:21.230
Five seconds, let's go, let's go.

53:21.230 --> 53:24.607
(alarm blaring)

53:24.607 --> 53:26.553
- Is this another one of
y'all Facebook's skits?

53:26.553 --> 53:28.886
- Mask off, I hear the cops.

53:30.309 --> 53:31.142
Babe, let's go.

53:31.142 --> 53:32.841
Let's go, let's go.

53:32.841 --> 53:35.508
(siren blaring)

53:37.791 --> 53:40.559
- Boss, the cops just pulled up.

53:40.559 --> 53:43.573
The couple is still inside.

53:43.573 --> 53:45.573
Hold up, here they come.

53:49.466 --> 53:51.216
- Hello.
- Follow me.

54:06.849 --> 54:09.432
- Seven and Tracy, have a seat.

54:14.325 --> 54:16.158
So, where's the money.

54:18.354 --> 54:20.097
- You talking about the
money you gave us yesterday?

54:20.097 --> 54:21.765
That's at the house.

54:21.765 --> 54:23.515
- My bank was robbed.

54:24.645 --> 54:25.526
And the only people who knew

54:25.526 --> 54:27.897
about the robbery was us.

54:27.897 --> 54:31.128
So where's my money, and
the little box you took?

54:31.128 --> 54:33.692
- Look, I thought your driver told you,

54:33.692 --> 54:36.647
we didn't get a chance to
rob your spot yesterday.

54:36.647 --> 54:38.024
Somebody else beat us to it.

54:38.024 --> 54:39.592
- So if you didn't rob our bank,

54:39.592 --> 54:41.308
who did you hire to do it?

54:41.308 --> 54:43.891
I don't like being played with.

54:44.896 --> 54:47.334
- Seems to me they're lying.

54:47.334 --> 54:49.536
This looks like you guys
walking in the bank.

54:49.536 --> 54:52.028
So you must know something.

54:52.028 --> 54:54.264
- Oh, so you got a photo
of us walking in the bank.

54:54.264 --> 54:55.540
Well, what about the photo of the people

54:55.540 --> 54:58.820
that walked in behind
us and robbed the bank?

54:58.820 --> 55:01.208
Look, you need to go back and
look at the cameras, okay?

55:01.208 --> 55:03.848
- All the cameras were
turned off for this job.

55:03.848 --> 55:04.928
- Wouldn't that be the case.

55:04.928 --> 55:08.496
- Look, I told you that
we didn't get a chance

55:08.496 --> 55:09.956
to rob your spot.

55:09.956 --> 55:11.964
Somebody else beat us to it.

55:11.964 --> 55:13.540
- Come on, you got to believe us.

55:13.540 --> 55:14.373
- Get down to the bank,

55:14.373 --> 55:15.656
and find out what they know.

55:15.656 --> 55:17.573
- Please.
- And where do

55:18.440 --> 55:19.768
you two think you're going?

55:19.768 --> 55:20.601
- We're leaving.
- We're leaving up

55:20.601 --> 55:21.644
out of here.

55:21.644 --> 55:22.932
We about to leave, baby.

55:22.932 --> 55:25.092
Hammer baby, look.
- Just give us a chance

55:25.092 --> 55:25.992
to prove ourselves.

55:25.992 --> 55:27.988
We did not rob your bank.

55:27.988 --> 55:29.571
Please, believe us.

55:30.792 --> 55:32.864
(Tracy mumbles)

55:32.864 --> 55:33.697
- I told you.

55:33.697 --> 55:36.664
I told you somebody
trying to frame us babe.

55:36.664 --> 55:38.052
Give that damn money back.

55:38.052 --> 55:39.252
- Look, we good.

55:39.252 --> 55:42.379
We not giving no money back.

55:42.379 --> 55:45.044
Somebody trying to set us up.

55:45.044 --> 55:46.364
- Well, what we're gonna do?

55:46.364 --> 55:48.584
We're gonna go see my man.

55:48.584 --> 55:50.063
- What he gonna.
- The tech guys.

55:50.063 --> 55:52.021
- Babe come on.

55:52.021 --> 55:53.917
- Yo Tech, what's up it's Seven.

55:53.917 --> 55:54.750
- Who is this?

55:54.750 --> 55:56.437
Who house we in?

55:56.437 --> 56:00.169
- We're at my man Tech house.
- Oh gosh.

56:00.169 --> 56:01.919
Who you taking us to?

56:02.762 --> 56:03.681
Who is this?

56:03.681 --> 56:06.264
- What up Tech?
- Seven, my man.

56:07.237 --> 56:09.725
What's up my guy?
- Cool, cool.

56:09.725 --> 56:10.805
- Excuse me miss.
- This is my girl Tracy,

56:10.805 --> 56:13.453
I was telling you about.
- Cool hair.

56:13.453 --> 56:15.612
- Thank you, you've been talking about me?

56:15.612 --> 56:18.804
- You already know.
- What's going on?

56:18.804 --> 56:23.804
- Can you log into a system
from early this morning?

56:23.936 --> 56:26.652
Even if the systems were off.

56:26.652 --> 56:29.036
- I think it was on
Florida, Florida Street.

56:29.036 --> 56:29.869
- Something like that.

56:29.869 --> 56:33.275
- The bank on the corner
of Florida Street.

56:33.275 --> 56:34.408
- Let's see what I can do.

56:34.408 --> 56:36.868
All I need to know is
the name of the banks.

56:36.868 --> 56:39.584
- Oh shit babe, that's us.

56:39.584 --> 56:42.072
Can you rewind that back please?

56:42.072 --> 56:45.388
- Oh shit, that's the bank manager.

56:45.388 --> 56:47.652
- And that's the bitch that
actually tried to threaten me.

56:47.652 --> 56:50.144
- And that's the punk ass
Uber driver that robbed us.

56:50.144 --> 56:54.032
- Oh my gosh, I see what's going on here.

56:54.032 --> 56:57.720
Look, can you put all this
on a USB drive if we need it?

56:57.720 --> 56:59.192
- Hey, this is me.

56:59.192 --> 57:01.020
I can log into someone's computer,

57:01.020 --> 57:03.840
and hear their whole conversation.

57:03.840 --> 57:06.590
- Where is the money and the box?

57:08.372 --> 57:11.039
- It's all at the drop location.

57:12.169 --> 57:14.540
- Good.
- Now all we have

57:14.540 --> 57:17.810
to do is carry out that crew
that we hired to intercept.

57:17.810 --> 57:21.079
But what about that
Seven and Tracy couple?

57:21.079 --> 57:23.272
- Bob is killing them as we speak.

57:23.272 --> 57:25.852
You don't have to worry
about those two anymore.

57:25.852 --> 57:27.504
I love it when you handle business.

57:27.504 --> 57:31.754
- Can you record what they
talking about right now?

57:32.807 --> 57:36.390
- It's illegal, but I got you.
- Oh shit.

57:36.390 --> 57:37.399
- And call my husband,

57:37.399 --> 57:39.559
tell him that black couple he hired.

57:39.559 --> 57:43.976
They took everything, and
they'll be dead by tonight.

57:45.783 --> 57:47.855
- Babe okay, he got it on a USB.

57:47.855 --> 57:49.251
Hey babe, we gotta go.

57:49.251 --> 57:50.451
'Cause we gotta try to catch her.

57:50.451 --> 57:52.327
'Cause she about to leave.

57:52.327 --> 57:54.364
- Didn't I tell you what my name was?

57:54.364 --> 57:57.080
I already tapped the phone,

57:57.080 --> 57:58.852
I'm gonna send a GPS to both of you.

57:58.852 --> 57:59.890
- Oh my, yo.

57:59.890 --> 58:00.960
Yo if you finally did some
shit right this time yo.

58:00.960 --> 58:02.793
- You are my geek boy.

58:04.076 --> 58:06.140
You my motherfucking geek, you hear me.

58:06.140 --> 58:08.176
- I like him too, but

58:22.348 --> 58:23.804
to set us the fuck up.

58:23.804 --> 58:24.685
What are we gonna do?

58:24.685 --> 58:26.144
We need to let her husband know.

58:26.144 --> 58:28.136
You think he ain't on this shit?

58:28.136 --> 58:30.622

You've got 30 minutes.

1:01:31.185 --> 1:01:34.761
Get the fucking gun, I'm
gonna kill this bitch.

1:01:34.761 --> 1:01:37.194
- Instead of just staring at me.

1:01:37.194 --> 1:01:38.978
Where's the money and the box?

1:01:38.978 --> 1:01:40.992
'Cause it's not in the trunk.

1:01:40.992 --> 1:01:42.204
- Oh, we got it right here.

1:01:42.204 --> 1:01:44.936
I figured we should just
hold it for collateral.

1:01:44.936 --> 1:01:46.436
So where's our money?

1:01:46.436 --> 1:01:49.796
- Where is the box that was in safe 1012?

1:01:49.796 --> 1:01:51.656
Your money is ready to be wired to you,

1:01:51.656 --> 1:01:53.290
once I get that box.

1:01:53.290 --> 1:01:56.172
- I don't have an account,
how am I getting paid?

1:01:56.172 --> 1:01:59.074
- Look you two dummies, where's the box?

1:01:59.074 --> 1:01:59.973
- Hey, chill out.

1:01:59.973 --> 1:02:01.723
We got it right here.

1:02:05.769 --> 1:02:08.033
- Oh, I see you're just
turning off everybody.

1:02:08.033 --> 1:02:10.555
- Everybody put your hands up.

1:02:10.555 --> 1:02:12.190
- Oh you don't have your little phone,

1:02:12.190 --> 1:02:14.125
to show no more photos?

1:02:14.125 --> 1:02:16.267
- I'll take that.
- Babe tie this bitch up.

1:02:16.267 --> 1:02:18.129
- Hey, what are you two trying to prove?

1:02:18.129 --> 1:02:21.777
- We're not trying to prove
anything, we're proving today.

1:02:21.777 --> 1:02:23.949
Do you know how much shit
you've took me though?

1:02:23.949 --> 1:02:25.377
- Does it look like I care?

1:02:25.377 --> 1:02:26.861
- I know you don't care,

1:02:26.861 --> 1:02:27.985
but you're going to have to care

1:02:27.985 --> 1:02:31.087
when you have to confess to your husband.

1:02:31.087 --> 1:02:33.505
- Look at this motherfucker.

1:02:33.505 --> 1:02:35.919
Mr.Uber driver, I like black women.

1:02:35.919 --> 1:02:38.665
- I like black women.
- You had to learn to rob me

1:02:38.665 --> 1:02:39.818
with a flashy gun.

1:02:39.818 --> 1:02:42.173
Get down, down on the floor.

1:02:42.173 --> 1:02:43.895
- What about popo?

1:02:43.895 --> 1:02:46.689
Get popo.
- Get your ass down too popo.

1:02:46.689 --> 1:02:47.577
- That's right, that's right.

1:02:47.577 --> 1:02:49.165
Don't miss nobody.

1:02:49.165 --> 1:02:49.998
But you know what,

1:02:49.998 --> 1:02:51.601
I think that this bitch
think that we're playing.

1:02:51.601 --> 1:02:53.969
Duct tape babe.
- What do you plan

1:02:53.969 --> 1:02:55.527
to do with that?

1:02:55.527 --> 1:02:59.961
- This right here honey.
- You psycho crazy bitch.

1:02:59.961 --> 1:03:02.013
- Are you ready to confess?

1:03:02.013 --> 1:03:04.445
Oh this bitch think I'm joking with her.

1:03:04.445 --> 1:03:06.331
Hammer babe.
- Babe, what you doing?

1:03:06.331 --> 1:03:08.157
You're going too far.
- Look, give me

1:03:08.157 --> 1:03:09.490
the damn hammer.

1:03:10.558 --> 1:03:12.425
(gun fires)

1:03:12.425 --> 1:03:14.929
- Anybody else want a
little piece of this?

1:03:14.929 --> 1:03:17.749
'Cause I'm sharing it out
to every fucking body.

1:03:17.749 --> 1:03:19.593
- Fuck, you shot me.

1:03:19.593 --> 1:03:21.779
What are you even doing here.

1:03:21.779 --> 1:03:24.075
- Yes moron, of all the people to help us,

1:03:24.075 --> 1:03:26.417
you chose the crazy black couple.

1:03:26.417 --> 1:03:29.027
- Look you better tell
her what she wanna hear,

1:03:29.027 --> 1:03:31.532
or I'ma put his ass in
a wheel chair forever.

1:03:31.532 --> 1:03:35.681
- Pound that motherfucker.
- Honey, please just tell them

1:03:35.681 --> 1:03:37.394

1:03:37.394 --> 1:03:39.803
You said we'd take the box,

1:03:39.803 --> 1:03:41.846
have you guys killed.

1:03:41.846 --> 1:03:44.277
Give the money back to your husband,

1:03:44.277 --> 1:03:45.974
the diamonds are worth more

1:03:45.974 --> 1:03:49.394
than all the money is those bags.

1:03:49.394 --> 1:03:51.278
Please just let us go.

1:03:51.278 --> 1:03:53.122
We can split the money,

1:03:53.122 --> 1:03:57.734
we'll take the box, and you'll
never hear from us again.

1:03:57.734 --> 1:03:59.122
It's out in the open.

1:03:59.122 --> 1:04:01.078
No more secrets.

1:04:01.078 --> 1:04:03.283
We can finally be together.

1:04:03.283 --> 1:04:05.306
- I though you said we
were gonna be together?

1:04:05.306 --> 1:04:07.438
I'm confused.
- That's who you've

1:04:07.438 --> 1:04:08.767
been talking about?

1:04:08.767 --> 1:04:11.890
- Yeah, yeah she hot, right?

1:04:11.890 --> 1:04:13.782
- Who is there, who else know we here?

1:04:13.782 --> 1:04:14.666
I called your cousin,

1:04:14.666 --> 1:04:16.766
'cause I though we needed back up.

1:04:16.766 --> 1:04:18.670
- What the fuck, what cousin?

1:04:18.670 --> 1:04:19.926
- Your crazy cousin.

1:04:19.926 --> 1:04:21.008
- Why the fuck you call him?

1:04:21.008 --> 1:04:22.241
You know he's crazy as hell.

1:04:22.241 --> 1:04:23.186
- That's why I called him.

1:04:23.186 --> 1:04:25.874
- Shit.
- See y'all got me fucked up.

1:04:25.874 --> 1:04:28.706
- Oh shit.
- Who the fuck's

1:04:28.706 --> 1:04:30.594
this fool looking at?

1:04:30.594 --> 1:04:31.572
Y'all got me fucked up.

1:04:31.572 --> 1:04:33.074
Tracy what's good?

1:04:33.074 --> 1:04:35.307
- Just a couple of white
people trying to kill me hun.

1:04:35.307 --> 1:04:37.722
Just a couple of white
people trying to kill me.

1:04:37.722 --> 1:04:39.990
- Look, I just need you to watch your back

1:04:39.990 --> 1:04:41.518
for a couple of hours.

1:04:41.518 --> 1:04:42.974
I'm trying to get you paid.

1:04:42.974 --> 1:04:43.915
- You got me fucked up.

1:04:43.915 --> 1:04:45.658
Do I look like a baby sitter?

1:04:45.658 --> 1:04:47.310
- You wanna get paid, don't you?

1:04:47.310 --> 1:04:49.334
- Look, we can just
put them in this trunk.

1:04:49.334 --> 1:04:50.369
We good, we good.

1:04:50.369 --> 1:04:51.330
You can leave.

1:04:51.330 --> 1:04:52.530
You can leave.

1:04:52.530 --> 1:04:54.942
- Man I walked all the way across town.

1:04:54.942 --> 1:04:55.978
Y'all got me fucked up.

1:04:55.978 --> 1:04:57.674
What the fuck y'all got going on?

1:04:57.674 --> 1:05:00.222
This white lady looks
like she got some money.

1:05:00.222 --> 1:05:01.890
I want in on this money.

1:05:01.890 --> 1:05:03.822
- You always inviting people into shit.

1:05:03.822 --> 1:05:05.730
He's getting his cut out of your money.

1:05:05.730 --> 1:05:08.518
He's paying you out of his money.

1:05:08.518 --> 1:05:11.158
- Look, you two will
not get away with this.

1:05:11.158 --> 1:05:13.901
You can't prove that I
was a part of any of this.

1:05:13.901 --> 1:05:17.069
You think that anybody
will listen to any of you.

1:05:17.069 --> 1:05:19.409
See, my husband is a rich prick,

1:05:19.409 --> 1:05:21.778
and you two were great for his plan.

1:05:21.778 --> 1:05:24.693
He hired you two 'cause you
were desperate for money.

1:05:24.693 --> 1:05:26.403
And our trade numbers just dropped,

1:05:26.403 --> 1:05:27.935
and we needed two people to take the fall,

1:05:27.935 --> 1:05:29.417
and you fools took the bait.

1:05:29.417 --> 1:05:31.533
So I decided to get the money

1:05:31.533 --> 1:05:34.606
before my divorce decree
papers were delivered to him.

1:05:34.606 --> 1:05:36.437
I'm tired of playing trophy wife.

1:05:36.437 --> 1:05:37.383
I wanted out,

1:05:37.383 --> 1:05:39.796
and you two are my key
to making that happen.

1:05:39.796 --> 1:05:42.139
'Cause my husband made me sign a prenup.

1:05:42.139 --> 1:05:43.835
Can you believe that?

1:05:43.835 --> 1:05:45.812
Even after I sucked his-

1:05:50.975 --> 1:05:53.751
- Yes, and he won't give
me anything if I leave.

1:05:53.751 --> 1:05:55.939

1:06:04.368 --> 1:06:08.151
and which by the way is $5.6 billion.

1:06:08.151 --> 1:06:12.635
- $5.6 billion, damn.
- Ain't no need to look at me.

1:06:12.635 --> 1:06:15.516

1:06:27.649 --> 1:06:30.623

1:06:46.491 --> 1:06:48.324
with your little herd.

1:06:49.731 --> 1:06:52.265

1:06:52.265 --> 1:06:54.743
