WEBVTT

00:08.403 --> 00:11.562
I'm telling you, this guy as a solid as they come

00:11.563 --> 00:12.905
You reached out to me with this score

00:12.906 --> 00:16.711
I'm thinkin there's no guys right for
this than my man Kola.

00:16.712 --> 00:17.304
Why is he giving me

00:17.305 --> 00:20.020
a beef about whether or not
the stones are gonna be there?

00:20.021 --> 00:21.894
You tell him how far
back we go? Come on.

00:21.895 --> 00:23.542
I've known you my whole life, bro.

00:23.543 --> 00:26.527
No, man. It's just,
he's a perfectionist.

00:26.528 --> 00:29.002
Trust me. That kind
of attitude pays off.

00:29.003 --> 00:31.584
I've been with this guy
in some serious takedowns.

00:31.585 --> 00:34.904
Montreal, Detroit, Chicago.

00:34.905 --> 00:37.106
He never blinks.

00:37.107 --> 00:39.140
Here he comes.

00:42.309 --> 00:44.438
Okay, one more time.

00:44.439 --> 00:46.859
I know, I know.
Never leave the truck.

00:46.860 --> 00:48.795
So I am boring you? No, man.

00:48.796 --> 00:51.189
It's j just...

00:52.815 --> 00:54.217
I get it.

00:54.218 --> 00:56.383
Never leave the truck.

00:56.384 --> 00:58.991
You, three minutes
means three minutes.

00:58.992 --> 01:00.481
Not a second more.

01:00.482 --> 01:02.314
When we are inside...
I watch the room.

01:02.315 --> 01:03.400
You watch the room.

01:03.401 --> 01:05.456
Somebody wants to be a hero...

01:07.083 --> 01:09.801
...you make them a martyr.

01:18.008 --> 01:18.852
How are you, sir?

01:18.853 --> 01:20.768
Nice to see you again.

01:25.986 --> 01:27.431
Sorry, sir.
The Commissioner is not...

01:27.432 --> 01:29.434
He's my son, Einstein.

01:29.435 --> 01:31.479
Relax.

01:33.286 --> 01:33.995
Commissioner...

01:33.996 --> 01:37.888
It's okay, Bill. He's my father.

01:39.507 --> 01:41.989
Hey, my old Fitz Special.

01:41.990 --> 01:43.051
You know, you'd get a lot more

01:43.052 --> 01:44.951
firepower if you
used an automatic.

01:44.952 --> 01:45.654
Oh, these days,

01:45.655 --> 01:48.209
I'm surrounded by people
who can shoot for me, Pop.

01:48.210 --> 01:50.298
Still, the thing's
practically an antique.

01:50.299 --> 01:52.059
It was built to last.

01:52.060 --> 01:54.143
That's exactly what
your grandfather said

01:54.144 --> 01:55.110
when he gave it to me.

01:55.111 --> 01:56.545
I like carrying your gun, Pop.

01:56.546 --> 01:58.916
Fair enough. Oh, I got my new I.D.

01:58.917 --> 01:59.948
I always thought it was silly how

01:59.949 --> 02:01.433
they stamped retired all over it.

02:01.434 --> 02:03.319
May as well say, "Rest in peace""

02:03.320 --> 02:06.271
You're lucky they're still
paying your pension.

02:06.272 --> 02:08.044
Yeah. What is this?

02:08.045 --> 02:09.140
It's supposed to be a camel.

02:09.142 --> 02:12.050
It was a gift from the police
chief in Amman, Jordan.

02:12.051 --> 02:13.353
Brave New World.

02:13.354 --> 02:15.653
I was lucky if I got a pine plaque

02:15.654 --> 02:17.496
from the Poughkeepsie police.

02:17.497 --> 02:21.465
Here. Pastrami on rye.

02:21.466 --> 02:23.287
Mrs. Friggins' Kitchen.

02:23.288 --> 02:26.463
What happened to your
war on cholesterol?

02:26.464 --> 02:27.282
Let's just say

02:27.283 --> 02:30.871
it's a tactical retreat.

02:32.459 --> 02:33.013
Hey, so we're set

02:33.014 --> 02:34.569
for Shakespeare in
the Park tonight?

02:34.570 --> 02:36.547
Can't wait.

02:40.500 --> 02:41.945
I was sitting with
Grandpa the other night.

02:41.946 --> 02:44.584
We were looking at
pictures from the old days.

02:44.585 --> 02:48.560
I remember seeing this pin on
his uniform... The Blue Templar.

02:48.561 --> 02:50.151
That was some kind
of fraternal group?

02:50.152 --> 02:52.484
Yeah, back in the days.

02:52.485 --> 02:54.866
He said you were
tapped for it, too.

02:54.867 --> 02:58.329
But if it was such a,
such a back-in-the-day thing...

02:58.330 --> 03:01.564
You a cop or a reporter?

03:02.428 --> 03:05.212
It's nothing for a
rookie to worry about.

03:20.337 --> 03:25.317
If we work smart,
by tonight we will be rich.

03:36.826 --> 03:37.789
Get out of here.

03:37.790 --> 03:39.516
You and Danny bringing
the girls to a play?

03:39.517 --> 03:41.992
You, Mr. Ivy League.

03:41.993 --> 03:43.372
But Danny...

03:43.373 --> 03:45.126
Yeah, Shakespeare in the Park.

03:45.127 --> 03:46.626
My cousin's a sergeant
in Central Park.

03:46.627 --> 03:47.898
He hooked us up with the tickets.

03:47.899 --> 03:48.876
No waiting on line.

03:48.877 --> 03:51.414
Danny Reagan and Shakespeare
in the same sentence.

03:51.415 --> 03:52.344
Yeah.

03:52.345 --> 03:53.906
It's the funniest
thing I ever heard.

03:53.907 --> 03:54.960
I'm trying to civilize him.

03:54.961 --> 03:56.286
Yeah? You and what army?

03:56.287 --> 03:57.663
Sector Adam 10-52.

03:57.664 --> 03:59.598
Family at four-six-seven
West five-two.

03:59.599 --> 04:00.448
Ah, nah.

04:00.449 --> 04:01.949
Not today.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.568
Please respond. You know this job?

04:03.569 --> 04:04.634
Do I ever.

04:04.635 --> 04:06.012
It's a chronic domestic job.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.695
Every three months,
these two knuckleheads

04:07.696 --> 04:09.117
go to war over something.

04:09.118 --> 04:10.768
Here.

04:10.769 --> 04:12.711
The only thing good about
this friggin' job is

04:12.712 --> 04:15.811
it keeps my marriage
in perspective.

04:23.995 --> 04:26.418
John Ganley is a pig!

04:26.419 --> 04:29.340
He sleeps with women not his wife!

04:29.341 --> 04:32.148
He's a Lothario!

04:32.149 --> 04:34.521
Alice... you changed tactics.

04:34.522 --> 04:37.656
Shows initiative. A pig!

04:37.657 --> 04:38.376
Alice,

04:38.377 --> 04:40.088
you can basically say
whatever you want,

04:40.089 --> 04:42.070
but the bullhorn and the pig,
they gotta...

04:42.071 --> 04:43.750
Penelope stays.

04:43.751 --> 04:45.366
- You named it? 
- Hey, Renzulli?

04:45.367 --> 04:47.132
Yeah? You see what I'm up against?

04:47.133 --> 04:48.651
I read the Constitution.

04:48.652 --> 04:49.807
Freedom of speech.

04:49.808 --> 04:53.138
Counselor, you want
to help me out here?

04:53.139 --> 04:54.867
Abundant...

04:54.868 --> 04:56.740
Abundant case law supports
restraint of speech

04:56.741 --> 04:59.017
when it infringes on public order.

04:59.018 --> 05:00.874
Where'd you find this one,
Renzulli?

05:00.875 --> 05:02.468
Hey, you wouldn't believe
me if I told you.

05:02.469 --> 05:03.710
Alice, you can stay,

05:03.711 --> 05:06.771
but the bullhorn and Penelope-
they got to go.

05:06.772 --> 05:08.468
Officer, deflate the pig.

05:08.469 --> 05:11.055
You got it, Sarge.

05:34.987 --> 05:37.718
Okay, three minutes.

05:57.071 --> 05:58.360
Yeah, I can talk, Mom.

05:58.361 --> 06:00.750
I'm on meal break.

06:02.717 --> 06:05.885
Yeah, no, John has
not told me anything.

06:08.279 --> 06:12.097
He says it's an
anniversary surprise.

06:13.492 --> 06:17.014
So I'm kind of looking
forward to that.

06:28.521 --> 06:30.377
Yeah.

06:42.876 --> 06:45.521
At the end of the day,
I'm not gonna force him.

06:45.522 --> 06:48.594
Three minutes now!

06:48.595 --> 06:49.595
FEMALE OFFICER: Thank you so much

06:49.596 --> 06:51.840
for letting Vincent stay over.

06:51.841 --> 06:53.781
All right. Bye.

06:57.116 --> 06:59.390
Police! Don't move!

07:21.838 --> 07:24.111
I'm sorry, sir.

07:24.112 --> 07:27.066
We have an officer down.

07:32.270 --> 07:34.156
Where? When? How?

07:34.157 --> 07:36.997
A uniform assigned to
Manhattan South task force.

07:36.998 --> 07:38.997
She happened on a 10-30
in the diamond district.

07:38.998 --> 07:39.994
Who is she?

07:39.995 --> 07:41.595
Police Officer Michelle Martin.

07:41.596 --> 07:44.234
On the job since '04,
married, one child.

07:44.235 --> 07:45.701
A boy.

07:45.702 --> 07:47.411
Six years old.

07:47.412 --> 07:50.119
Likely? Not likely?

07:50.120 --> 07:53.007
She was pronounced en
route to Bellevue, sir.

07:53.008 --> 07:54.618
We're withholding that information

07:54.619 --> 07:55.499
so it doesn't get out

07:55.500 --> 07:58.303
over the airwaves. Assemble all

07:58.304 --> 08:01.372
the super chiefs and chiefs in
the command center, forthwith.

08:01.373 --> 08:02.703
Yes, sir. Hogan?

08:02.704 --> 08:03.589
Sir?

08:03.590 --> 08:07.396
I want all tours extended,
no cops go home.

08:42.167 --> 08:43.784
Inspector? Hey.

08:43.785 --> 08:46.303
This is my new partner,
Detective Jackie Curatola.

08:46.304 --> 08:48.450
We worked Manhattan North
Narcotics back in the day.

08:48.451 --> 08:50.531
Tough first day in
the command. No joke.

08:50.532 --> 08:52.308
So, what do we got?
Bad news, Danny.

08:52.309 --> 08:53.802
Kid was on the job six years.

08:54.377 --> 08:56.021
She was in my command
when I had the 3-4.

08:56.022 --> 08:57.561
She was real police.

08:57.562 --> 08:58.916
These guys knew what
they were doing.

08:58.917 --> 09:00.354
They were in and out
in three minutes.

09:00.355 --> 09:02.485
The take is north of five million.

09:02.486 --> 09:04.607
So, this officer-
she just happened upon this?

09:04.608 --> 09:06.114
Yeah, according to her sergeant,

09:06.115 --> 09:07.940
she was on duty, but out to meal.

09:07.941 --> 09:10.852
She swung by the block to
get her wedding ring resized.

09:10.853 --> 09:12.046
Damn.

09:12.047 --> 09:13.390
How are we doing on canvas?

09:13.391 --> 09:14.866
The witnesses are all over the map

09:14.867 --> 09:16.479
with their descriptions
of the perps

09:16.480 --> 09:17.885
The only thing they all agree on is

09:17.886 --> 09:20.034
three male whites, one tall.

09:20.035 --> 09:21.644
Tall one's the shooter.

09:21.645 --> 09:24.282
So the tall guy shoots her,
she fires back after she's hit,

09:24.283 --> 09:26.787
and nails the small guy.

09:27.991 --> 09:29.270
Tough kid.

09:29.271 --> 09:32.627
All right, so, they come out,
small guy's hit around here.

09:32.628 --> 09:33.746
Stumbles over to the van.

09:33.747 --> 09:36.295
This is probably his blood,
so we got a bleeder.

09:36.296 --> 09:39.739
I want to check out hospitals,
doctors' offices, veterinarians.

09:39.740 --> 09:42.564
Anywhere he might have
gone to get some help.

09:48.996 --> 09:52.266
All right, good, okay?

09:54.851 --> 09:56.324
At this time,
we have over 300 members

09:56.325 --> 09:58.328
of service deployed canvass,

09:58.329 --> 09:59.989
extending 1,000 feet out
from the location.

09:59.990 --> 10:03.132
Add another hundred uniforms,
go river to river.

10:03.133 --> 10:04.734
The Con Electric truck.

10:04.735 --> 10:05.959
Nothing yet, sir.

10:05.960 --> 10:07.915
I want it found. Yes, sir.

10:07.916 --> 10:10.409
Department should be advised
that the Feds are on board.

10:10.410 --> 10:12.751
Good. I want the D.A.
S in all five boroughs ready

10:12.752 --> 10:15.818
to expedite any paper we
might need on warrants.

10:15.819 --> 10:18.603
Any questions?

10:18.604 --> 10:20.764
Let's get att.

10:24.553 --> 10:26.990
Sir, the, uh,
family and the husband

10:26.991 --> 10:30.158
of the deceased are waiting
for you in your office.

10:32.668 --> 10:34.506
Okay.

10:59.429 --> 11:00.977
Sorry I'm late, Sydney.

11:00.978 --> 11:02.573
This is so terrible.

11:02.574 --> 11:04.441
I can't believe another
cop has been killed.

11:04.442 --> 11:05.920
It's been all over the news.

11:05.921 --> 11:07.518
Yeah.

11:07.519 --> 11:09.786
That poor girl.

11:09.787 --> 11:12.232
I guess this is no night to go
to A Midsummer Night's Dream.

11:12.233 --> 11:13.469
Yeah, no.

11:13.470 --> 11:17.076
Shakespeare can wait.

11:17.077 --> 11:18.720
Always starts the same way.

11:18.721 --> 11:19.673
What do you mean?

11:19.674 --> 11:20.973
Well, the fanfare,

11:20.974 --> 11:22.895
the damn media'll be
crawling all over this story

11:22.896 --> 11:25.104
like a pack of rats.

11:25.105 --> 11:26.839
Yeah, front page coverage
for about a week.

11:26.840 --> 11:29.377
But, then you know what happens.

11:29.378 --> 11:33.174
I hope I never find out.

11:33.175 --> 11:35.343
The whole world moves on,

11:35.344 --> 11:39.273
and the family is left
suffer in obscurity.

11:39.274 --> 11:41.639
I can't imagine.

11:41.640 --> 11:44.330
They said she had a
six-year-old son.

11:44.331 --> 11:46.975
Yeah.

11:46.976 --> 11:49.954
You know, the department
will do what it can.

11:49.955 --> 11:52.330
The family will get
a nice pension.

11:52.331 --> 11:54.968
She'll make the Wall of Heroes.

11:54.969 --> 12:00.007
Maybe they'll name
a street after her.

12:01.321 --> 12:03.898
But the hurt...

12:03.899 --> 12:08.065
Well, that... that goes
down the generations.

12:09.810 --> 12:12.876
How do you deal
with the day-to-day,

12:12.877 --> 12:15.663
not knowing if Danny
will come home?

12:15.664 --> 12:18.458
Every time I hear a
cop has been shot...

12:20.634 --> 12:26.662
I hold my breath until
I know Danny is okay.

12:26.663 --> 12:29.983
And even though I feel
awful for the other family,

12:29.984 --> 12:32.737
God forgive me,

12:34.629 --> 12:38.209
I'm so relieved it's not my Danny.

12:47.763 --> 12:49.329
All right. Thanks for coming in.

12:49.330 --> 12:50.770
Your fence give you anything good?

12:50.771 --> 12:52.482
No, ice came out of
the clear blue sky.

12:52.483 --> 12:54.017
Not a whisper in the
gemstone community.

12:54.018 --> 12:56.043
His guess? Stone's going
out of the country.

12:56.044 --> 12:58.429
There's an ARGUS camera with a
perfect view of the crime scene,

12:58.430 --> 12:59.841
only it didn't get anything.
Come here.

12:59.842 --> 13:01.688
Look at this.

13:04.052 --> 13:04.955
It's at the same exact time

13:04.956 --> 13:06.665
as the 911 call. Yeah.

13:06.666 --> 13:08.120
Back that up.

13:10.745 --> 13:12.495
Hold on.

13:13.950 --> 13:15.665
How is it that the one
street light in New York City

13:15.666 --> 13:18.334
that can block our camera view
of the crime is being fixed?

13:18.335 --> 13:19.554
This guy just happens
to come along

13:19.555 --> 13:21.967
ten minutes before
the heist to fix it?

13:21.968 --> 13:23.145
You think it's a coincidence?

13:23.146 --> 13:26.500
No, no, there's 330,000 street
lights in New York City.

13:26.501 --> 13:27.598
How do you know that?

13:27.599 --> 13:30.390
I dated an electrician.
Local Three guy. Long story.

13:30.391 --> 13:32.178
Enlighten me some other time.
I don't believe

13:32.179 --> 13:33.246
in coincidences, do you?

13:33.247 --> 13:34.944
No. Not on that scale.

13:34.945 --> 13:36.165
How does that happen, huh?

13:36.166 --> 13:38.406
330,000 street lights
in the city of New York,

13:38.407 --> 13:41.583
and you just happen to be fixing
the one that messes up my day?

13:41.584 --> 13:42.675
What are the odds on that?

13:42.676 --> 13:43.638
You're a gambler.

13:43.639 --> 13:44.844
Who told you I gamble?

13:44.845 --> 13:46.286
Well, let's see.

13:46.287 --> 13:47.978
Your computer, your phone bills,

13:47.979 --> 13:49.752
your text messages, your e-mails,

13:49.753 --> 13:50.626
your credit cards,

13:50.627 --> 13:52.064
and your bank records... look,

13:52.065 --> 13:53.587
I know every asinine
thing you've done

13:53.588 --> 13:55.295
since the second grade,
so don't play with me.

13:55.296 --> 13:56.429
I'm just a street light guy.

13:56.430 --> 13:58.125
Really?

13:58.126 --> 14:00.535
Says he's just a street
light guy, this guy.

14:02.670 --> 14:05.471
Those are my kids.

14:05.472 --> 14:06.869
Go ahead, touch it.

14:06.870 --> 14:08.328
Touch it. Come on. Touch it.

14:08.329 --> 14:09.937
How's it feel? Feel good?

14:09.938 --> 14:14.221
Well, you better
learn to love it Why?

14:14.222 --> 14:15.898
Because that's the closest
you're ever going to get

14:15.899 --> 14:17.570
to touching your kids again.

14:17.571 --> 14:19.269
Don't touch anything.

14:19.270 --> 14:20.121
You know what cop killers get?

14:20.122 --> 14:21.269
They get maximum security,

14:21.270 --> 14:22.788
which means no physical contact,

14:22.789 --> 14:23.879
so you don't touch anything.

14:23.880 --> 14:25.308
Cop killer? All I did
was park my truck.

14:25.309 --> 14:26.293
Really? They killed a cop.

14:26.294 --> 14:28.561
And you helped them,
so that makes you a cop killer, too.

14:28.562 --> 14:30.737
In fact, don't even ok at me.
Turn your head away from me.

14:30.738 --> 14:32.779
Now!

14:34.536 --> 14:36.171
Disgusting.

14:37.684 --> 14:41.411
I was in over my head to
my bookie for 50 large.

14:41.412 --> 14:42.541
He said if I don't help him

14:42.542 --> 14:43.741
and his guys,
he's going to kill me.

14:43.742 --> 14:44.991
I swear on my kids' eyes.

14:44.992 --> 14:46.375
These guys are savages.

14:46.376 --> 14:48.561
And? Who's your bookie?

14:48.562 --> 14:49.525
I give you these...

14:49.526 --> 14:49.982
Don't look at me.

14:49.983 --> 14:50.872
I give you these guys,

14:50.873 --> 14:52.519
my life is not worth
a plug nickel.

14:52.520 --> 14:53.594
Who's your bookie?

14:53.595 --> 14:56.679
Pick better friends next time.

14:56.680 --> 14:58.603
I talk, I want witness protection.

14:58.604 --> 14:59.250
Yes!

14:59.251 --> 15:01.579
Yes! What else can we do
for you today, Andrew?

15:01.580 --> 15:03.844
Hey, jackass!

15:03.845 --> 15:06.490
Tell me who your bookie is!

15:08.296 --> 15:09.431
Ricky Vintano.

15:09.432 --> 15:10.783
Ricky Vintano?

15:10.784 --> 15:13.227
Happy Jack Vintano's kid?

15:13.228 --> 15:15.394
Yeah, that's him.

15:42.515 --> 15:44.390
All clear!

15:47.642 --> 15:48.807
We just missed him.

15:48.808 --> 15:50.843
It's still cold. Let's go.

15:53.389 --> 15:55.788
Hey, I want you to get dumps
on these computers forthwith.

15:55.789 --> 15:56.603
You got it, Danny.

15:56.604 --> 15:57.587
Go.

15:57.588 --> 15:59.793
I bet you Ricky winds
up at his daddy's.

15:59.794 --> 16:01.940
Big tough guys do.

16:06.698 --> 16:07.439
Detectives.

16:07.440 --> 16:08.784
Commissioner Reagan.

16:08.785 --> 16:10.256
Vintano leave anything behind

16:10.257 --> 16:11.401
that would tell us
where he's going?

16:11.402 --> 16:12.449
We seized two computers.

16:12.450 --> 16:13.876
CCS will acquire the hard drives.

16:13.877 --> 16:15.615
We'll see what kind of
trail this guy left us.

16:15.616 --> 16:17.809
We're also thinking of giving
his old man Happy Jack a shake.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.946
Okay, well, I have three words
for you: call my lawyer.

16:19.947 --> 16:21.556
Put him under 24-hour
surveillance.

16:21.557 --> 16:23.616
The kid makes contact,
we'll know abut it.

16:23.617 --> 16:25.183
Yes, sir. They found
the Con Electric truck

16:25.184 --> 16:27.659
abandoned in a parking
lot over on West 51st.

16:27.660 --> 16:29.336
Crime Scene Garage going
to start processing it.

16:29.337 --> 16:31.674
Let's see if this
tells us anything.

16:34.920 --> 16:37.972
Family was in my office, Danny.

16:39.342 --> 16:42.144
I got to get this son of a bitch.

16:42.145 --> 16:45.469
I'll kick down every door this
punk's ever walked through, Dad.

16:45.470 --> 16:47.692
I know you will.

16:55.119 --> 16:58.674
Sarge, we finally got somewhere
on the camera footage.

16:58.675 --> 16:59.997
This video came from a camera

16:59.998 --> 17:01.771
located outside of
a nightclub on 5-1.

17:01.772 --> 17:03.429
It's halfway between
the crime scene

17:03.430 --> 17:06.238
and where the perps dumped
the Con Electric truck.

17:06.239 --> 17:07.782
That is our boy Ricky Vintano

17:07.784 --> 17:08.981
making his getaway
with the diamonds.

17:08.982 --> 17:10.474
Splitting up part of the plan?

17:10.476 --> 17:12.234
We're thinking Ricky he might
have called an audible,

17:12.236 --> 17:13.296
went into business for himself.

17:13.297 --> 17:14.848
Well, either way,
we still have to nail Ricky

17:14.849 --> 17:17.310
and his two pals, whether he's
with them, or against them.

17:17.311 --> 17:18.550
Yeah, well, we've rounded up

17:18.551 --> 17:19.887
every heist guy left walking.

17:19.888 --> 17:21.835
We've torn through every known
associate of Ricky Vintano.

17:21.836 --> 17:23.193
So far, we got squat.

17:23.194 --> 17:24.781
And we checked all the
hospitals for a bleeder.

17:24.782 --> 17:26.291
We got nothing.

17:26.292 --> 17:28.061
Hey. You should
check this guy out.

17:28.063 --> 17:29.746
We snagged him from
one of Ricky Vintano's

17:29.747 --> 17:31.764
gambling joints.

17:33.130 --> 17:34.005
This is is Billy Leo.

17:34.006 --> 17:35.807
He tends bar for Ricky Vintano.

17:35.808 --> 17:36.978
Now, the problem with Billy is,

17:36.979 --> 17:41.026
he's on parole, and we found an
eight ball of coke in his sock.

17:41.027 --> 17:42.062
Then...

17:42.063 --> 17:45.050
two ounces in his car.

17:45.051 --> 17:47.472
Tell them what you told me.

17:47.473 --> 17:49.530
About a week ago, I'm closing up.

17:49.531 --> 17:51.456
Ricky comes in with two guys.

17:51.457 --> 17:53.513
Some Albanian I don't know,

17:53.514 --> 17:55.568
and the other guy it took
me a minute to recognize.

17:55.569 --> 17:56.451
Why's that?

17:56.452 --> 17:58.555
It's been about 15 years.
He's older.

17:58.556 --> 18:01.709
Looks like he's been gobbling steroids,
but he's still short.

18:01.710 --> 18:03.591
It's Jimmy C.

18:03.592 --> 18:06.238
Jimmy Costello.

18:06.239 --> 18:07.493
Johnny Fat's kid?

18:07.494 --> 18:08.554
Yeah.

18:08.555 --> 18:09.567
Him and Ricky Vintano,

18:09.568 --> 18:11.110
they've been best
pals since growing up.

18:11.111 --> 18:13.270
Two brats with major
Mob guys for fathers.

18:13.271 --> 18:14.667
Okay. This other
guy with Costello,

18:14.668 --> 18:16.158
he's short, kind of stocky?

18:16.159 --> 18:18.158
No... tall, six-two,

18:18.159 --> 18:20.826
built, foreign accent.

18:20.827 --> 18:22.562
Seemed like a very
heavy guy to me.

18:22.563 --> 18:24.049
Is that it? That's all you got?

18:24.050 --> 18:26.559
I give you something,
you going to throw me to the wolves?

18:26.560 --> 18:28.732
These guys scare me just
sitting there and drinking,

18:28.733 --> 18:31.913
and I don't scare easy.

18:31.914 --> 18:33.163
We can't help you.

18:33.164 --> 18:35.185
Come on! I can't
do the kind of time

18:35.186 --> 18:36.263
that comes with that weight.

18:36.264 --> 18:37.971
Hey, you think you're
scared of those guys?

18:37.972 --> 18:39.638
They just killed a cop.

18:39.639 --> 18:41.757
You don't know how
scary that can make me.

18:41.758 --> 18:42.953
You want to walk on the coke?

18:42.954 --> 18:44.866
I need more.
I need something real.

18:44.867 --> 18:46.654
I need something real and
you ain't got nothing.

18:46.655 --> 18:48.066
When they left...

18:48.067 --> 18:49.858
I went to lock the
door behind them.

18:49.859 --> 18:53.300
They got into a black Caddy.
A rental.

18:53.301 --> 18:54.320
How did you know it was rented?

18:54.321 --> 18:55.218
'Cause when the guy sat down,

18:55.219 --> 18:56.281
he put his keys on the bar.

18:56.282 --> 18:57.435
It was a car rental keychain.

18:57.436 --> 18:58.188
You know how many
Caddies are rented

18:58.189 --> 18:59.721
in New York City right now?

18:59.722 --> 19:01.440
This is baloney.
We ain't got time for this guy.

19:01.441 --> 19:03.515
It had New York plates.

19:03.516 --> 19:04.978
Started with M-A-L.

19:04.979 --> 19:06.678
You always remember
license plates?

19:06.679 --> 19:08.302
Nah.

19:08.303 --> 19:11.005
It's my mother's initials.

19:11.006 --> 19:14.144
Jimmy Costello. Another wannabe
son of a real gangster.

19:14.145 --> 19:16.725
He stabs a kid outside a
bar up on Fordham Road.

19:16.726 --> 19:18.730
His old man sends
him up to Montreal.

19:18.731 --> 19:19.530
Yeah, I remember that case.

19:19.531 --> 19:21.245
Didn't the witness to the
stabbing OD on heroin?

19:21.246 --> 19:22.621
Uh-huh. But Jimmy stayed up

19:22.622 --> 19:24.162
in Montreal anyway, right?

19:24.163 --> 19:25.714
I guess word was
Happy Jack banned him

19:25.715 --> 19:26.677
because he was too wild,

19:26.678 --> 19:28.383
but mostly just wanted to
keep him away from Ricky.

19:28.384 --> 19:29.383
How ironic.

19:29.384 --> 19:30.179
Well, this Costello

19:30.180 --> 19:31.914
caught at least one bullet,
and nothing's come up

19:31.915 --> 19:35.112
in our medical canvass;
I doubt he's in any condition to travel.

19:35.113 --> 19:36.720
Yeah, well, if Ricky
split with the diamonds,

19:36.721 --> 19:38.556
Jimmy and the Albanian are
going to be looking for him,

19:38.557 --> 19:40.379
so he's probably still here.

19:40.380 --> 19:41.694
So we I.D.'d two out of three.

19:41.695 --> 19:43.861
We got Ricky Vintano
and Jimmy Costello.

19:43.862 --> 19:45.071
Just need our shooter.

19:45.072 --> 19:46.360
Let's track down that black Caddy.

19:46.361 --> 19:47.779
See what it says.

19:47.780 --> 19:49.214
All right.

19:52.040 --> 19:53.903
I don't care what time.
Keep me posted.

19:53.904 --> 19:55.909
Hey!

19:55.910 --> 19:57.412
Nicky!

19:57.413 --> 19:58.273
You got your hair cut.

19:58.274 --> 19:59.822
Now I can see your beautiful face.

19:59.823 --> 20:01.014
Thanks, Grandpa.

20:01.015 --> 20:02.458
I missed you so much.

20:02.459 --> 20:04.004
I missed you, too.
How was the coast?

20:04.005 --> 20:05.831
San Francisco was amazing.

20:05.832 --> 20:07.765
Plus, we went to the
Aquarium in Monterey.

20:07.766 --> 20:10.308
It's so much cooler than
the one in Coney Island.

20:10.309 --> 20:11.664
Best time of my life.

20:11.665 --> 20:12.578
That's great.

20:12.579 --> 20:15.704
Of course, she's two weeks
behind on her schoolwork.

20:15.705 --> 20:16.994
What?

20:16.995 --> 20:17.884
Hey, you're a Reagan.

20:17.885 --> 20:19.974
Get in the kitchen. Hit the books.

20:19.975 --> 20:21.531
Go on.

20:22.893 --> 20:24.627
She's been dying to see you.

20:24.628 --> 20:27.657
Yeah? I think you're stuck
with the role of bad cop.

20:27.658 --> 20:28.758
Yeah.

20:28.759 --> 20:29.789
Which is ironic,

20:29.790 --> 20:31.830
since I'm the only one in
the family who isn't one.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.833
Hey, Francis.

20:33.834 --> 20:34.841
Yeah?

20:34.842 --> 20:37.766
Happy Jack Vintano's kid
is the main suspect?

20:37.767 --> 20:40.146
Well, he ain't no Happy Jack.

20:40.147 --> 20:43.512
Jack used to run the numbers
between Bay Ridge and Riverdale.

20:43.513 --> 20:44.863
Transports you, does it?

20:44.864 --> 20:48.369
Should I put on some
Sinatra and Nat King Cole?

20:48.370 --> 20:50.004
Different day,
different way to do business.

20:50.005 --> 20:51.325
"Business," He calls it.

20:51.326 --> 20:53.036
Yeah, Happy Jack used to be called

20:53.037 --> 20:54.138
"The good bad guy."

20:54.139 --> 20:57.199
I'm sure his victims
felt differently.

20:57.200 --> 20:58.042
Give me some help here.

20:58.043 --> 20:59.721
You know the way the
city used to be.

20:59.722 --> 21:03.209
I never had your appreciation
for the gray area, Pop.

21:03.210 --> 21:05.913
Well, let me tell you something.

21:05.914 --> 21:07.784
Happy Jack wanted to hurt you,

21:07.785 --> 21:09.165
you probably had it coming.

21:09.166 --> 21:12.211
He was strictly a
numbers and sports guy.

21:12.212 --> 21:14.711
No guns, no girls, no dope.

21:14.712 --> 21:16.218
A regular Mother Teresa.

21:16.219 --> 21:20.124
How was he with the
lame and downtrodde

21:20.125 --> 21:21.977
The guy was a Marine in Korea.

21:21.978 --> 21:24.480
We were in the same unit,
six months apart.

21:24.481 --> 21:26.779
He gave the commissioner
a run for his money.

21:26.780 --> 21:28.140
He was a worthy adversary.

21:28.141 --> 21:30.817
But on a case like this,
cop killed?

21:30.818 --> 21:32.028
Happy Jack Vintano

21:32.029 --> 21:33.840
was on our side.

21:33.841 --> 21:35.707
You remember when they
killed Jimmy Farrell?

21:35.708 --> 21:38.263
Yeah. Nice kid.

21:38.264 --> 21:40.651
Airborne Ranger back from 'Nam.

21:40.652 --> 21:42.044
Chest full of medals.

21:42.045 --> 21:45.138
I went to see Vintano
off the books.

21:45.139 --> 21:46.868
The mutt who killed Jimmy Farrell?

21:46.869 --> 21:48.773
Two days later, he showed up dead.

21:48.774 --> 21:50.603
Wrapped in a bow. Well...

21:50.604 --> 21:52.894
Nobody chased that case too hard.

21:52.895 --> 21:54.674
Good old days. HENRY: Maybe not.

21:54.675 --> 21:55.718
But let me tell you something.

21:55.719 --> 22:00.732
Unlike today, everyone
knew where the line was...

22:00.733 --> 22:03.110
and what it cost...

22:03.111 --> 22:05.351
when you crossed it.

22:13.094 --> 22:15.176
You know, Officer Martin
joined the department

22:15.177 --> 22:18.673
right after seeing
me speak at Syracuse.

22:18.674 --> 22:23.493
You know, sometimes I think you
blame yourself for Joe.

22:23.494 --> 22:26.620
Anytime a cop dies, it's like
losing a member of the family.

22:26.621 --> 22:28.188
Don't forget he jumped out of bed

22:28.189 --> 22:29.970
every morning he was on the job.

22:29.971 --> 22:32.656
And everything I've heard
about Officer Martin

22:32.657 --> 22:34.445
says she was the same way.

22:34.446 --> 22:37.781
Price of leadership inspiring
people to their doom?

22:37.782 --> 22:39.705
No.

22:39.706 --> 22:42.534
You spire people to
do the right thing.

22:42.535 --> 22:45.940
The price is what we sometimes
pay for the life we choose.

22:45.941 --> 22:49.107
I know all that.

22:49.108 --> 22:50.775
But thank you.

23:01.674 --> 23:03.915
This the surveillance video
on Happy Jack Vintano?

23:03.916 --> 23:05.193
Yeah.

23:05.194 --> 23:08.130
This guy is the pork store,
the cheese store,

23:08.131 --> 23:10.429
the bakery, the fishmonger...

23:10.430 --> 23:12.344
That's why they call him
Happy Jack. He should

23:12.345 --> 23:13.720
have his own show
on the Food Network.

23:13.721 --> 23:16.513
Makes me want to move to the Bronx,
all that good food.

23:16.514 --> 23:19.832
He's a man of habit,
but no sign of prodigal son Ricky.

23:19.833 --> 23:22.908
I almost feel bad for the old man.
That's a maximum "Almost""

23:22.909 --> 23:24.173
I'm just saying,
he was king of his own world.

23:24.174 --> 23:25.567
Now it's all passed him by.

23:25.568 --> 23:27.553
Hey, that Caddy,
turns out it was rented

23:27.554 --> 23:29.538
outside of Buffalo
by Jimmy Collins,

23:29.539 --> 23:31.482
AKA Costello.

23:31.483 --> 23:33.121
Nothing popped up on the LPR's,

23:33.122 --> 23:35.928
but it did pick up a ticket last
night on Bruckner Boulevard.

23:35.929 --> 23:37.824
Want to check it out?

23:51.152 --> 23:54.419
I understand I can get some of the
best sausage in the city here.

23:56.996 --> 23:59.918
So the food is lousy
in Brooklyn these days?

23:59.919 --> 24:03.080
Brooklyn ain't what it used to be.

24:03.081 --> 24:06.006
Not much is.

24:06.007 --> 24:07.911
I see that kid of
yours made out good.

24:07.912 --> 24:09.506
Matter of perspective.

24:09.507 --> 24:12.045
The kid now has my old job.

24:12.046 --> 24:12.692
It's better him

24:12.693 --> 24:15.727
than some creep off the street.

24:15.728 --> 24:17.473
You had a good run.

24:17.474 --> 24:19.698
Likewise.

24:19.699 --> 24:21.917
Come here,
I'll show you something.

24:24.673 --> 24:26.795
This is beautiful.

24:28.870 --> 24:31.954
He grows the fennel and
the chili peppers himself.

24:31.955 --> 24:36.053
He throws a little extra
cold red wine into the mix.

24:36.054 --> 24:37.755
Reminds me of the
stuff my father made

24:37.756 --> 24:40.037
in Calabria when I was a boy.

24:40.038 --> 24:42.904
Grazie.

24:42.905 --> 24:48.982
We were, uh... we were
talking about my kid.

24:48.983 --> 24:52.875
I need to ask you
about yours, Jack.

24:52.876 --> 24:55.799
I thought you were retired.

24:55.800 --> 24:58.669
I'm coming as a courtesy.

24:58.670 --> 25:00.218
You know, all that time
and energy we spent

25:00.219 --> 25:02.437
trying to outsmart each other...

25:02.438 --> 25:04.430
who runs the numbers now?

25:04.431 --> 25:07.266
You go to 7-Eleven,
you bet a horse,

25:07.267 --> 25:10.154
the state'll take
your money at the OTB.

25:10.155 --> 25:12.785
We were the bad guys.

25:12.786 --> 25:15.808
You know things change.

25:15.809 --> 25:18.171
The funny thing is,
I can see that,

25:18.172 --> 25:21.001
but my kid... he's blind to it.

25:21.002 --> 25:23.472
You made it this far,
alive and free.

25:23.473 --> 25:25.552
I mean, that's a million-to-one
shot in your racket.

25:25.553 --> 25:27.936
I did, but now my son.

25:27.937 --> 25:29.517
I was never one of those morons

25:29.518 --> 25:32.646
that wanted their
kids around this life.

25:32.647 --> 25:33.551
I don't know,

25:33.552 --> 25:36.670
is this how it goes,
the sins of the father?

25:36.671 --> 25:39.967
You know better than most, Jack.

25:39.968 --> 25:42.201
A cop goes down,

25:42.202 --> 25:44.953
no quarter is given.

25:53.325 --> 25:55.453
Man, oh, man!

25:57.123 --> 25:59.827
You got Danny Reagan's
cell phone number?

26:07.904 --> 26:10.320
That's the partial plate.

26:10.321 --> 26:12.724
And there's the ticket.

26:16.509 --> 26:18.617
Think we should
wait for a warrant?

26:18.618 --> 26:20.313
Nah. Can't you hear that
person calling for help?

26:20.314 --> 26:22.359
Oh, yeah.

26:27.060 --> 26:29.196
Pop the trunk.

26:32.134 --> 26:34.401
Think we found Jimmy.

26:34.402 --> 26:36.449
Yeah. Too late.

26:36.450 --> 26:37.591
Yeah.

26:37.592 --> 26:39.739
That Officer Martin was
something else, huh?

26:39.740 --> 26:41.537
Mortally wounded,
and still had the wherewithal

26:41.538 --> 26:42.984
to put a slug in this creep.

26:42.985 --> 26:44.729
Nice piece of shooting-
I just wish

26:44.730 --> 26:46.033
she would've gotten to him first.

26:46.034 --> 26:47.484
Did he bleed out? I don't think

26:47.485 --> 26:49.094
he had time... look at his neck.

26:49.095 --> 26:51.509
Classic manual
strangulation markings...

26:51.510 --> 26:53.116
crushed larynx.

26:53.117 --> 26:54.645
The guy was choked to death.

26:54.646 --> 26:57.059
Oh, don't tell me-
no honor among thieves.

26:57.060 --> 26:58.357
I'm shocked.

26:58.358 --> 26:59.280
And my mother complains

26:59.281 --> 27:01.034
about her retirement package.

27:01.035 --> 27:04.222
Ricky better hope we get to
him before his partner does.

27:04.223 --> 27:05.318
As long as we get the shooter,

27:05.319 --> 27:08.591
I don't give a damn what
they do to Ricky Vintano.

27:16.688 --> 27:18.941
Perps were picked up on
this camera on 5th Avenue

27:18.942 --> 27:21.041
located right near
the crime scene.

27:21.042 --> 27:23.135
The time stamp is two days before

27:23.136 --> 27:24.367
the officer was killed.

27:24.368 --> 27:25.338
They're casing the place...

27:25.339 --> 27:26.342
so who's our shooter?

27:26.343 --> 27:28.003
This third guy.

27:28.004 --> 27:29.526
We sent his picture to Interpol.

27:29.527 --> 27:31.150
They believe it's Dukajan Kola,

27:31.151 --> 27:32.743
AKA Monster.

27:32.744 --> 27:34.520
He's a high-stakes jewel thief,

27:34.521 --> 27:36.694
an ethnic Albanian
from Montenegro.

27:36.695 --> 27:38.882
How's he tie in to
Vintano and Costello?

27:38.883 --> 27:40.059
Interpol believes he's hiding out

27:40.060 --> 27:42.333
in Montreal where he
hooked up with Jimmy C.

27:42.334 --> 27:43.037
This guy Kola's

27:43.038 --> 27:44.118
a real piece of work.

27:44.119 --> 27:45.207
He's wanted for a home invasion

27:45.208 --> 27:46.212
outside of Montreal

27:46.213 --> 27:47.803
with five bodies attached to it.

27:47.804 --> 27:49.495
He shot and killed
a family of four.

27:49.496 --> 27:51.279
Fifth body was his partner.

27:51.280 --> 27:52.729
Which means he doesn't
like to share.

27:52.730 --> 27:53.429
No.

27:53.430 --> 27:54.200
Also means he's not gonna

27:54.201 --> 27:55.959
leave New York City
without his diamonds.

27:55.960 --> 28:00.110
Let's find Vintano
before his partner does.

28:04.692 --> 28:07.346
You got an extra
pair of collar stars?

28:07.347 --> 28:09.403
I can't find mine.

28:09.404 --> 28:11.801
How was your trip to the Bronx?

28:11.802 --> 28:14.963
Are you gonna bang a guy
for trying to pitch in?

28:14.964 --> 28:17.727
Your pal Happy Jack knows enough
to use throwaway cell phones

28:17.728 --> 28:20.155
but not enough to know
we have shotgun mikes

28:20.156 --> 28:23.510
that can pick up a
conversation two blocks away.

28:23.511 --> 28:26.365
Which is what TARU did three
minutes after you left.

28:26.366 --> 28:27.200
So?

28:27.201 --> 28:28.677
So he called his son.

28:28.678 --> 28:30.534
He's trying to save his son.

28:30.535 --> 28:33.103
Which is exactly what
we would be doing. We?

28:33.104 --> 28:35.060
So send in the Marines

28:35.061 --> 28:36.347
next time.

28:36.348 --> 28:37.971
You know what the press
will do with this?

28:37.972 --> 28:39.062
How are they gonna find out?

28:39.063 --> 28:41.092
Happy Jack gonna post
it on his "Blob"?

28:41.093 --> 28:44.001
You think NYPD's the only
agency watching Vintano?

28:44.002 --> 28:45.434
Oh, I get it,

28:45.435 --> 28:46.780
I get it. You're worried

28:46.781 --> 28:49.285
yo senior citizen father
is going to embarrass you.

28:49.286 --> 28:52.296
My worry is, you may have
cut off our only avenue

28:52.297 --> 28:54.772
to a cop killer.

28:54.773 --> 28:58.048
Okay. Okay, okay.

29:00.815 --> 29:03.814
Maybe I shouldn't have
gone and seen Vintano.

29:03.815 --> 29:06.465
But the only way you're
gonna get this kid

29:06.466 --> 29:09.911
is if Happy Jack reels him in.

29:20.303 --> 29:23.496
Monsignor Moran, Mr. Mayor...

29:23.497 --> 29:26.778
Mr. And Mrs. Martin, John...

29:26.779 --> 29:30.015
Vincent.

29:30.016 --> 29:33.459
Back in the days when
the city first formed

29:33.460 --> 29:37.211
the police department,
the poet Walt Whitman wrote:

29:37.212 --> 29:41.634
"I dreamed in a dream I saw a city

29:41.635 --> 29:43.412
"Invincible to the attacks

29:43.413 --> 29:45.908
of the whole of the
rest of the Earth."

29:45.909 --> 29:48.077
As a New York City police officer

29:48.078 --> 29:50.897
who worked the city
streets every day,

29:50.898 --> 29:53.356
Officer Michelle Martin knew,

29:53.357 --> 29:55.468
better than most,

29:55.469 --> 30:00.004
that the dream has not
yet been realized.

30:00.005 --> 30:03.166
But Officer Martin endeavored

30:03.167 --> 30:06.923
to make the dream a reality.

30:06.924 --> 30:10.096
She was devoted...

30:10.097 --> 30:13.584
she was true...

30:13.585 --> 30:16.167
she was brave.

30:16.168 --> 30:18.418
And she made a choice.

30:18.419 --> 30:22.057
She chose to live
a life of service.

30:22.058 --> 30:26.169
She chose to put
herself in harm's way,

30:26.170 --> 30:31.098
to be a guardian to the
people of this great city.

30:32.188 --> 30:37.257
We will never be able
to thank Officer Martin.

30:37.258 --> 30:40.509
She made the supreme sacrifice.

30:41.856 --> 30:44.854
But this we can...

30:44.855 --> 30:47.759
and will do.

30:47.760 --> 30:52.712
We will remember her always.

30:52.713 --> 30:57.167
We will remember that even
when mortally wounded,

30:57.168 --> 31:00.077
she had the strength and composure

31:00.078 --> 31:03.170
to return fire.

31:03.171 --> 31:06.415
We will remember

31:06.416 --> 31:09.072
that in her life

31:09.073 --> 31:12.852
and in her death...

31:12.853 --> 31:17.911
she embodied all that we,
as citizens,

31:17.912 --> 31:20.963
can hope to be.

31:27.666 --> 31:31.674
: May God bless M...

31:31.675 --> 31:34.577
May God bless Michelle

31:34.578 --> 31:37.868
and welcome her home.

32:35.429 --> 32:36.895
Funeral was tough.

32:36.896 --> 32:38.243
Tell me you got some
good news for me.

32:38.244 --> 32:40.927
I got some news that's
gonna cheer you up.

32:40.928 --> 32:42.266
Here.

32:42.267 --> 32:43.526
Hop in.

32:43.527 --> 32:46.170
I'll change in the back. Okay.

32:59.806 --> 33:02.207
All right, listen to this-
this just came in.

33:02.208 --> 33:04.719
Ricky called his father.

33:05.812 --> 33:08.428
Uh, Dad, I'm all banged up,
I got nowhere to go.

33:08.429 --> 33:11.055
HAPPY JACK: Ricky,
the cops are listening.

33:11.056 --> 33:13.560
You gotta turn yourself in.

33:13.561 --> 33:15.668
It's the only way.

33:15.669 --> 33:17.234
Can we locate where
the call originated?

33:17.235 --> 33:19.203
Yeah, it came in from Parkchester.

33:19.204 --> 33:20.771
The RTC just called,

33:20.772 --> 33:23.606
said Vintano did a
bit up in Greenhaven.

33:23.607 --> 33:24.749
What's Parkchester?

33:24.750 --> 33:26.853
Didn't... Ricky had a cell
mate when he was in Greenhaven

33:26.854 --> 33:28.602
from Parkchester, right,
a Shawn something?

33:28.603 --> 33:29.559
Shawn Randolph.

33:29.560 --> 33:32.073
Yeah, got compassionate
parole in '98.

33:32.074 --> 33:34.365
Had liver cancer,
died three months later.

33:34.366 --> 33:35.112
Right, but he's dead.

33:35.113 --> 33:36.415
That's why we scratched
him off the list

33:36.416 --> 33:37.715
of known associates for Ricky.

33:37.716 --> 33:38.693
So who's in Parkchester?

33:38.694 --> 33:39.334
His ex

33:39.335 --> 33:41.202
Lori Kent still resides there.

33:41.203 --> 33:44.230
She made half a dozen
visits up to Greenhaven...

33:44.231 --> 33:46.983
get this... after Randolph croaked.

33:46.984 --> 33:48.048
So Shawn's ex

33:48.049 --> 33:49.701
was visiting Ricky in prison?

33:49.702 --> 33:52.179
Wow, ain't love grand?

33:52.180 --> 33:54.571
Don't look, I got to do my pants.

33:54.572 --> 33:58.076
Body wasn't even cold yet,
this tomato jumps horses.

33:58.077 --> 33:59.752
Yeah, well,

33:59.753 --> 34:02.812
let's pay the merry
widow a visit, huh?

34:16.929 --> 34:19.466
Don't make me do anything
you're gonna regret.

34:21.204 --> 34:22.849
Put your hands on the dashboard.

34:22.850 --> 34:26.487
Put 'em on the dashboard
before I put a bullet in you!

34:27.538 --> 34:29.485
It's my lucky day, Ricky.

34:29.485 --> 34:31.704
I got you before the bad guys did.

34:31.705 --> 34:32.725
Yeah.

34:32.726 --> 34:34.672
Keep smiling.

34:37.216 --> 34:42.208
Lawyer, lawyer, lawyer!

34:42.208 --> 34:45.588
Lawyer!

34:45.589 --> 34:47.538
Your lawyer can't help you now.

34:47.539 --> 34:48.713
You're a cop killer.

34:48.714 --> 34:49.963
Even your d man can't help you.

34:49.964 --> 34:53.234
Hey, my dad had nothing to
do with this, all right?

34:53.235 --> 34:55.761
Reagan, Reagan,
what are we doing here?

34:55.762 --> 34:57.935
Yeah, what are we doing? Shut up!

35:02.531 --> 35:03.923
Listen to me, listen to me.

35:03.924 --> 35:05.099
Step aside, Jackie.
Listen, just listen...

35:05.100 --> 35:06.206
Jackie. Listen to me.

35:06.207 --> 35:07.653
This whole case,
you haven't said anything

35:07.654 --> 35:08.457
about your brother Joe,

35:08.458 --> 35:10.373
and I know it is
probably killing you,

35:10.374 --> 35:14.279
but do not do anything stupid.

35:14.280 --> 35:16.745
Listen to me.

35:16.746 --> 35:17.855
We worked together what,
three, four years

35:17.856 --> 35:20.746
back in the day, Jack?

35:20.747 --> 35:22.994
Good partner.

35:22.995 --> 35:24.210
You always had my back.

35:24.211 --> 35:26.284
Do me a favor.

35:26.285 --> 35:29.435
Watch it one more time, okay?

35:33.342 --> 35:34.300
Come on.

35:34.301 --> 35:35.662
Get out.

35:37.223 --> 35:38.746
Let's go.

35:40.765 --> 35:42.994
Come on.

35:42.995 --> 35:45.776
Come on!

35:45.777 --> 35:47.286
Get up.

35:47.287 --> 35:49.373
Get up, get up.

35:49.374 --> 35:50.591
Move.

35:50.592 --> 35:53.320
I said move.

35:53.321 --> 35:56.226
You know what happened in
this spot on July 13, 1975?

35:56.227 --> 35:58.199
***

35:58.200 --> 35:59.383
Yeah?

35:59.384 --> 36:00.985
Your old man killed a guy,

36:00.986 --> 36:02.735
shot him twice in the
back of the head.

36:02.736 --> 36:04.492
Bang, bang.

36:04.493 --> 36:05.582
You're crazy.

36:05.583 --> 36:07.448
Yeah, you want to know
what happened next?

36:07.449 --> 36:08.402
Nothing.

36:08.403 --> 36:10.376
You want to know why?

36:10.377 --> 36:11.287
'Cause your old man

36:11.288 --> 36:13.595
killed a guy that the
whole city wanted dead.

36:13.596 --> 36:16.102
Yeah, Happy Jack
killed a cop killer.

36:16.103 --> 36:17.263
Yeah, so?

36:17.264 --> 36:18.649
So?

36:18.650 --> 36:21.328
So now you're a cop killer, Ricky.

36:21.329 --> 36:22.153
Yeah.

36:22.154 --> 36:22.840
You've become the thing

36:22.841 --> 36:25.357
that even your old man
knew had to be wiped out.

36:25.358 --> 36:26.829
I don't know what you're
talking about. You don't?

36:26.830 --> 36:28.193
Well, how about I
spell it out for you?

36:28.194 --> 36:29.907
The last time a cop
killer was brought here,

36:29.908 --> 36:31.045
they pulled him out of the river

36:31.046 --> 36:32.697
with two bullet holes
in the back of his head

36:32.698 --> 36:33.827
and they still ruled it a suicide.

36:33.828 --> 36:35.060
You starting to get the drift,
Ricky, huh?

36:35.061 --> 36:36.790
I'll give you the diamonds,
man, I'll give you the...

36:36.791 --> 36:39.616
I don't want the diamonds!

36:39.617 --> 36:42.226
You killed a cop!

36:44.706 --> 36:46.618
All I did was drive, bro. Yeah?

36:46.619 --> 36:48.032
Wrong answer.

36:48.033 --> 36:50.917
So now I'm gonna give
you a choice, Ricky.

36:50.918 --> 36:52.572
You're going to
give me the shooter

36:52.573 --> 36:55.341
or I'm gonna do
what Happy Jack did.

36:55.342 --> 36:57.482
I'm gonna put two bullets...

36:57.483 --> 37:01.084
...in the back of a
cop killer's head.

37:02.890 --> 37:05.087
The shooter, Ricky.

37:05.088 --> 37:07.872
Give me the shooter!

37:10.455 --> 37:12.162
Hey.

37:12.163 --> 37:13.459
Monster.

37:13.460 --> 37:14.173
What?

37:14.174 --> 37:17.922
Monster... they call him Monster.

37:17.923 --> 37:18.846
His name is Kola.

37:18.847 --> 37:23.430
There's a warehouse over
by the Manhattan Bridge.

37:45.606 --> 37:47.181
That cop-killing animal still in there?

37:47.182 --> 37:48.121
Yeah, he's in there.

37:48.122 --> 37:49.441
Perimeter is locked down.

37:49.442 --> 37:50.852
There's only one way out.

37:50.853 --> 37:53.109
Come on, come on.

38:10.442 --> 38:12.039
OFFICER :Here we go.

39:14.446 --> 39:17.462
Now I can sleep.

39:30.489 --> 39:32.772
