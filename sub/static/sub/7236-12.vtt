00:05.504 --> 00:08.038
<i>Accessing archive data...</i>

00:08.039 --> 00:10.272
<i>Let's go again.</i>

00:10.606 --> 00:13.975
<i>Tron eases his apprentice
into the role of a hero...</i>

00:14.010 --> 00:18.013
Zed, this is an N-com 786
first gen lightbike.

00:18.047 --> 00:21.883
<i>While Mara's role at the garage
gets unexpected notice.</i>

00:21.918 --> 00:25.053
Well, it's nice to see
someone's got an appreciation

00:25.087 --> 00:27.022
for older technology.

00:27.056 --> 00:30.992
<i>Meanwhile, Beck keeps
his identity a secret...</i>

00:31.027 --> 00:35.030
How did you become the Renegade?

01:07.797 --> 01:11.933
All right, Tron...
I hope this works.

01:21.677 --> 01:24.946
Uh! I... this isn't my tank.

01:24.981 --> 01:27.682
Sorry for the mix-up. Carry on.

01:30.853 --> 01:33.755
<i>Okay, you got me.</i>

01:41.931 --> 01:46.034
<i>Attention.
Perimeter breach in Level 3.</i>

01:50.006 --> 01:53.641
You wouldn't leave without
saying goodbye, would you?

01:53.676 --> 01:57.979
- So much for a quiet exit.
- How about a quiet death, instead?

02:03.953 --> 02:05.653
After him!

02:25.708 --> 02:27.609
Fire!

02:28.674 --> 02:38.174
<b>S01E12 - We Both Know How This Ends</b>

02:49.070 --> 02:52.755
- What's going on?!
- Huh.

03:10.925 --> 03:13.927
Hmm. Apparently I'm
getting the hang of this.

03:54.882 --> 03:57.550
No respect.

03:57.585 --> 04:01.621
If the second shift thinks I'm gonna
come in and clean up after them...

04:01.655 --> 04:03.656
- Mara.
- Able!

04:03.691 --> 04:06.493
I... ahem.
I didn't hear you come in.

04:06.527 --> 04:07.894
I need to take care of some business

04:07.928 --> 04:10.864
I should have taken
care of a long time ago.

04:10.898 --> 04:15.602
- Have Beck or Zed come in yet?
- N-no. Not yet.

04:15.636 --> 04:19.805
But... I will let them know
you're looking for them.

04:19.839 --> 04:23.510
There's no time.
I'm already late.

04:23.544 --> 04:25.845
You're in charge.

04:25.880 --> 04:29.516
- Me?
- What other choice do I have?

04:29.550 --> 04:32.652
<i>It's gonna be a slow day, so
you shouldn't have any trouble.</i>

04:32.686 --> 04:34.954
<i>Well, she's all yours, Mara.</i>

04:34.989 --> 04:39.559
- I won't let you down!
- I know you won't.

04:56.710 --> 04:58.812
<i>So then, this one program who's</i>

04:58.813 --> 05:00.914
been listening this whole time goes,

05:00.948 --> 05:04.684
"ya know, that's not energy
you've been drinking."

05:04.718 --> 05:06.619
- Ha ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

05:06.654 --> 05:09.622
- Wait. I don't get it.
- What do you mean you don't get it?

05:09.657 --> 05:10.757
You're late.

05:10.791 --> 05:15.695
- Both of you.
- So? Did Able say something?

05:15.729 --> 05:18.731
No. But he left a list of
things that need to get done

05:18.766 --> 05:23.570
- while he's gone.
- Able's gone?

05:23.604 --> 05:25.738
- Where'd he go?
- That's not important.

05:25.773 --> 05:28.541
You don't know, do you?

05:28.576 --> 05:31.945
Uh, what I do know is
that he left me in charge.

05:34.515 --> 05:36.783
So can I count on you
to help me out?

05:38.686 --> 05:40.820
- Of course.
- What do you need us to do?

05:40.854 --> 05:44.791
Well...
the lift has been acting up.

05:44.825 --> 05:47.961
Done. When we're finished,
it'll be as good as new.

05:47.995 --> 05:52.565
- Thanks, guys.
- Give me a break, Zed.

05:52.600 --> 05:54.634
What do you know about a transport lift?

05:54.668 --> 05:58.538
Nothing. Which explains how
I broke it in the first place.

06:49.857 --> 06:51.557
Grid bugs.

07:26.760 --> 07:30.463
So finally the one program goes,

07:30.497 --> 07:34.701
"ya know, that's not energy
you've been drinking." huh?

07:34.735 --> 07:36.803
- I don't get it.
- I don't get it.

07:36.837 --> 07:39.605
- See?
- What do you mean you don't get it?

07:39.640 --> 07:40.907
Maybe you're telling it wrong.

07:40.941 --> 07:43.576
Well, that was quick.

07:43.610 --> 07:46.779
Yeah, about the lift...
Zed, tell her.

07:46.814 --> 07:51.517
Nothing to tell. It seemed to work
just fine when we tried it, so...

07:51.552 --> 07:53.519
You haven't fixed it, have you?

07:53.554 --> 07:55.855
- We were just about to start.
- Start?!

07:55.889 --> 07:58.858
See? I told you she'd be upset!

07:58.892 --> 08:03.429
Hey, Mara, we could really use
some time off this afternoon?

08:03.464 --> 08:06.733
- If that's okay.
- Is the chopper done?

08:06.767 --> 08:10.403
Not all of it, but we'll
finish it when we get back.

08:10.437 --> 08:13.740
Besides, we can't do anything until
someone gets that lift working.

08:13.774 --> 08:14.774
- It...
- Hmm.

08:14.808 --> 08:17.543
Fine. But don't take too long.

08:17.578 --> 08:21.381
- Thanks, Mara.
- You're the best!

08:21.415 --> 08:24.350
Uh, don't you both have work to do?

08:24.385 --> 08:25.718
You just gave Dash and Copper...

08:25.753 --> 08:30.490
Dash and Copper didn't break the lift.
Yeah. I know it was you.

08:30.524 --> 08:33.326
Oh, fine.

08:33.360 --> 08:35.727
But only because I like you. Uh...

08:35.763 --> 08:40.533
As a friend. You're my friend.
I mean, uh...

08:40.567 --> 08:42.602
<i>Huh? What's that, Dash?</i>

08:42.635 --> 08:45.538
Come on. We got plenty of
time before Able gets back.

08:45.572 --> 08:48.574
Everything will get done.
Don't worry.

08:51.412 --> 08:52.545
<i>Watch out!</i>

09:08.695 --> 09:11.531
Okay, now you can worry.

09:19.404 --> 09:21.606
Can I help you?

09:21.640 --> 09:25.743
My tanks have been sabotaged by that
perfidious provocateur the Renegade.

09:25.777 --> 09:29.780
I need them repaired immediately.
The damage is extensive.

09:29.815 --> 09:32.516
But I'm sure you don't
need me to tell you that.

09:32.551 --> 09:35.753
Nice one, Renegade. Real nice.

09:35.787 --> 09:40.524
- If you want to wait for Able...
- What I want is for you to do your job.

09:40.559 --> 09:43.394
General Tesler needs these
tanks fully operational.

09:43.428 --> 09:47.431
- No problem.
- For your sake, I hope not.

09:47.466 --> 09:49.567
I'll be back for them
before the end of your shift.

09:49.601 --> 09:52.687
And if they're not completed
by the time I return, well,

09:52.688 --> 09:55.773
there are far worse punishments
than the games, I can assure you.

10:02.581 --> 10:06.517
Such a shame...

10:06.551 --> 10:09.754
Reliable mechanics
are so hard to come by.

10:58.269 --> 11:00.471
What's the diagnosis?

11:00.505 --> 11:02.640
The damaged code is constantly mutating.

11:02.674 --> 11:07.678
- Its design makes it irreversible.
- Irreversible. Genius.

11:07.713 --> 11:09.780
So what's the plan?

11:09.815 --> 11:13.751
We need to open up these
tanks and examine the code.

11:13.785 --> 11:18.589
One-by-one. Maybe isolate
the problem before it spreads?

11:18.623 --> 11:23.461
- How long will that take?
- I don't know, but it's our best option.

11:23.495 --> 11:26.464
It'll be faster if we work together,
figure this out as a team.

11:26.498 --> 11:27.698
There's no time.

11:27.733 --> 11:30.701
Everyone! Take a tank.
Divide and conquer.

11:30.736 --> 11:33.437
We can reconstruct
the code from scratch.

11:33.472 --> 11:35.592
What do you think you're doing?
Able put me in charge.

11:35.607 --> 11:39.376
And that decision is
gonna get us all derezzed.

11:39.411 --> 11:40.711
Easy Dash. It's not her fault.

11:40.746 --> 11:42.747
Able couldn't have
known this would happen.

11:42.781 --> 11:46.383
Well, it happened.
And I'm not gonna get sent to the games

11:46.418 --> 11:48.896
for someone else's mistake.
Anyone who doesn't want to end up in

11:48.931 --> 11:51.689
a million little pieces,
come with me!

11:51.723 --> 11:56.660
<i>Look, we can do this if we
all just work together, and...</i>

11:56.695 --> 12:00.631
<i>This isn't the way
Able would have wanted!</i>

12:02.768 --> 12:06.670
Ohh. Thanks for your vote
of confidence back there.

12:24.723 --> 12:27.792
Uh, does anyone know
if this is normal?

12:27.826 --> 12:29.760
Uh, help! Uh...

12:31.496 --> 12:33.464
<i>Hey, watch out! You crazy?!</i>

12:33.498 --> 12:35.399
Sorry. Sorry.

12:39.671 --> 12:43.374
Whew. It's okay.
I got it under control.

12:48.513 --> 12:49.747
Who's doing that?!

12:49.781 --> 12:52.550
Shut that thing down before
you destroy the whole...

12:52.584 --> 12:54.485
<i>Great. No, no. No.</i>

12:54.519 --> 12:56.520
<i>No, no, no, no!!!</i>

13:52.510 --> 13:54.678
Hello, Able.

14:03.249 --> 14:06.852
Here. For your healing chamber.

14:06.886 --> 14:09.755
This should buy you more time.

14:09.789 --> 14:13.992
Tell me, why did you
really call me here?

14:14.026 --> 14:16.828
Because I want you to stop.

14:16.863 --> 14:21.800
- I know about Beck.
- Beck's training is essential.

14:21.834 --> 14:24.102
To what end?
What's your grand plan?

14:24.137 --> 14:25.971
If you have one at all.

14:26.005 --> 14:29.875
Argon needs to be shown that
they're capable of fighting back.

14:29.909 --> 14:32.778
Even if Beck is derezzed in the process?

14:32.812 --> 14:35.147
- He knows the stakes.
- We all know the stakes!

14:35.181 --> 14:38.183
But only one of us seems
concerned about the consequences.

14:41.053 --> 14:43.989
Beck is not ready for this!
And you know it!

14:45.958 --> 14:49.161
We both know how this ends.

15:00.173 --> 15:03.742
<i>Not like that!</i>

15:03.776 --> 15:06.945
<i>I am gonna get everyone
sent to the games.</i>

15:06.979 --> 15:11.082
I just wanted to prove to
Able that I could handle this.

15:11.117 --> 15:15.887
We know you did. It's not your fault
Link blew a hole through the chopper.

15:15.922 --> 15:18.857
Or that Zed dumped a tank into the sea.

15:18.891 --> 15:22.961
- What did you say?
- Zed dumping the tank into the sea?

15:22.995 --> 15:25.964
Oh, like you're so perfect?

15:25.998 --> 15:29.701
- Link! I need your help.
- You do?

15:29.735 --> 15:30.769
- You do?
- You do?

15:30.803 --> 15:32.971
Your tank, you got it to fire.
How?

15:33.005 --> 15:35.874
I don't know.
It was an accident.

15:35.908 --> 15:39.911
Show me.
Show me exactly what you did.

15:39.946 --> 15:42.814
I can't keep helping
you like this...

15:42.849 --> 15:45.717
Not if you continue to involve Beck.

15:45.751 --> 15:48.854
You can't... or you won't?

15:48.888 --> 15:52.757
I won't watch him become
another one of your mistakes!

15:52.792 --> 15:54.793
You're leaving me no choice.

15:54.827 --> 15:59.130
You've always had a choice...
you're just not making the right one.

16:01.067 --> 16:03.869
Not me, dummy! Grid bugs!

16:15.715 --> 16:17.015
There's too many of them!

16:19.685 --> 16:23.788
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Let's get this over with!

16:37.837 --> 16:41.806
Next time we meet...
I choose the location.

16:48.748 --> 16:52.984
- There. Just like before.
- That's why your tank fired.

16:53.019 --> 16:57.022
You accidentally triggered a fail-safe
which unlocks the original code.

16:57.056 --> 17:01.960
If we can isolate that, we
can duplicate it, and... there.

17:01.994 --> 17:03.061
D-did it work?

17:10.703 --> 17:12.637
How much time do we have?

17:12.672 --> 17:15.973
Not enough.
There are too many tanks.

17:16.008 --> 17:18.810
We'll get them done.
Beck and I can start on the others...

17:20.846 --> 17:21.980
<i>Beck?</i>

17:22.013 --> 17:25.116
All right, Renegade.
You got us into this mess...

17:25.151 --> 17:29.721
Hey! Where are you going?

17:29.755 --> 17:31.756
Don't worry.
I'm gonna take care of this.

17:31.791 --> 17:34.993
Maybe I can recruit some extra
mechanics. In the meantime...

17:35.027 --> 17:39.998
Oh, no. Not a chance.
Your antics may have worked with Able,

17:40.032 --> 17:43.034
but not with me,
and certainly not now.

17:43.069 --> 17:46.104
I'm in charge, and I will
get these tanks fixed.

17:46.138 --> 17:49.874
So if I were you, I would spend
less time trying to avoid work,

17:49.909 --> 17:52.877
and more time trying to
not get sent to the games.

17:52.912 --> 17:55.981
- Am I clear?
- Crystal.

17:56.015 --> 17:59.884
Good. Now get back out there.

18:03.756 --> 18:06.691
<i>Everyone! Listen up.</i>

18:10.663 --> 18:12.897
<i>I know today has been hard.</i>

18:12.932 --> 18:15.734
<i>And I know a lot of it is my fault.</i>

18:15.768 --> 18:20.639
<i>I kept trying to make everyone
happy, and be a friend,</i>

18:20.673 --> 18:22.941
<i>when you needed me to be a leader.</i>

18:22.975 --> 18:27.078
<i>But I won't let you
suffer for my mistake.</i>

18:27.113 --> 18:30.749
<i>If we don't finish, I'll
take full responsibility</i>

18:30.783 --> 18:33.118
<i>and will go to the games
in place of all of you.</i>

18:33.152 --> 18:36.688
<i>But if we work together,
that won't happen.</i>

18:36.722 --> 18:38.990
You know how to reverse
what the Renegade did?

18:52.038 --> 18:54.706
Tell us what you need us to do.

19:07.086 --> 19:10.889
The Coliseum's about to
get much more crowded.

19:15.895 --> 19:20.031
I'm feeling rather generous,
so I'll give you all a choice:

19:20.066 --> 19:22.734
You can either be derezzed right now,

19:22.768 --> 19:25.036
or wait till the games.
Ha ha! Up to you!

19:25.071 --> 19:28.073
Your tanks are ready,
Pavel, as instructed.

19:28.107 --> 19:32.677
- Fully operational.
- We'll see about that.

19:44.857 --> 19:48.927
Well, well.
These tanks do look tip-top...

19:48.961 --> 19:51.629
except for the one that's missing!

19:52.732 --> 19:56.768
I gave you twelve tanks to repair,
but I only see eleven!

19:56.802 --> 20:01.940
So I'll ask again.
Be derezzed now, or at the games?

20:01.974 --> 20:03.842
<i>Sorry!</i>

20:06.979 --> 20:09.881
Last minute polish.

20:12.818 --> 20:15.653
Looks like we've got what
we need. Let's move out.

20:15.688 --> 20:18.823
I truly loathe this place.

20:29.969 --> 20:31.102
How did you...

20:31.137 --> 20:34.038
Remember that lift
that I allegedly broke?

20:34.073 --> 20:37.142
Well, I may have allegedly fixed it.

20:56.896 --> 20:59.052
You don't mind returning
it for me, do you?

20:59.053 --> 21:02.901
- Return it to who?
- I think you know.

21:04.770 --> 21:06.971
Well, I see the garage
is still standing.

21:07.006 --> 21:09.674
I take it everything went smoothly?

21:09.708 --> 21:13.111
- Hmm, nothing out of the ordinary.
- That's a relief.

21:13.145 --> 21:16.915
From the looks of things,
I made the right decision with you.

21:16.949 --> 21:20.018
Uh, I... I thought you said
you didn't have a choice.

21:20.052 --> 21:23.721
