ONE HECK OF A GOOD-LOOKING
FELLA, BILLY.

18:17.757 --> 18:18.922
- OH, BILLY.

18:18.924 --> 18:20.590
[LAUGHS]

18:20.592 --> 18:22.124
- YO, BILLY!

18:24.294 --> 18:26.294
QUIT TALKING TO YOURSELF.

18:27.430 --> 18:29.596
- 1 AGAINST 100?

18:29.598 --> 18:31.130
- A HUNDRED?

18:32.933 --> 18:35.099
Y'ALL ARE DUMBER
THAN I THOUGHT.

18:35.101 --> 18:38.435
- WELL, IF ONE'S NOT ENOUGH,

18:38.437 --> 18:40.437
HOW ABOUT 5?

18:40.439 --> 18:42.439
- OR 10?

18:42.441 --> 18:45.442
- 15.

18:45.444 --> 18:46.776
- 20.

18:46.778 --> 18:47.777
- 30.

18:47.779 --> 18:49.311
- 40.

18:49.313 --> 18:51.212
- 50.

18:51.214 --> 18:52.580
- 100!

18:52.582 --> 18:56.116
- WELL, BUTTER MY BACKSIDE
AND CALL ME A BISCUIT.

18:56.118 --> 18:58.084
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY'S
DONE FIGURED A WAY

18:58.086 --> 19:01.420
TO DUPLICATE
MY DUPLICATION POWERS.

19:12.632 --> 19:14.431
Y'ALL MAY HAVE
COPIED A COPIER,

19:14.433 --> 19:17.700
BUT YOU'LL NEVER BE
AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL.

19:17.702 --> 19:19.334
- YEE-HA!

19:19.336 --> 19:20.635
- TITANS, GO!

19:25.341 --> 19:26.640
- GET HIM!

19:31.345 --> 19:32.644
- HA!

20:08.414 --> 20:09.513
- HEY!

20:17.422 --> 20:18.687
- HUH?

20:52.889 --> 20:54.722
- HEY, BILLY, I GOT ONE!

21:00.829 --> 21:06.098
- NOBODY, BUT NOBODY,
OUTNUMBERS BILLY NUMEROUS!

21:09.636 --> 21:11.268
UH-OH.

21:31.923 --> 21:33.655
AW, DANG.

21:36.359 --> 21:39.026
- HOLOGRAMS WORKED
LIKE A CHARM, CYBORG.

21:39.028 --> 21:40.627
- I HEARD THAT.

21:40.629 --> 21:44.397
WE BROUGHT DOWN BILLY
AND I DIDN'T EVEN
HAVE TO MOVE.

21:59.679 --> 22:02.579
- DUDE,
TURTLES KNOW WHAT'S UP.

22:05.883 --> 22:07.282
- BOO-YAH!

22:07.284 --> 22:08.650
NOW, WHAT SHOULD WE DO

22:08.652 --> 22:10.084
WITH THE REST
OF THIS BEAUTIFUL DAY?

22:10.086 --> 22:11.585
GO FISHING?
PIG OUT ON ICE CREAM?

22:11.587 --> 22:13.720
HANG IN THE NEW GAME ROOM?

22:15.423 --> 22:18.724
ACTUALLY, I KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT I WANT TO DO.

22:26.632 --> 22:28.698
[SNORING]

22:46.417 --> 22:47.916
- ¶ T-E-E-N ¶

22:47.918 --> 22:49.450
¶ T-I-T-A-N-S ¶

22:49.452 --> 22:52.252
¶ TEEN TITANS, LET'S GO! ¶

22:52.254 --> 22:53.753
¶ T-E-E-N ¶

22:53.755 --> 22:55.321
¶ T-I-T-A-N-S ¶

22:55.323 --> 22:58.090
¶ TEEN TITANS, LET'S GO! ¶

22:58.092 --> 22:59.424
¶ T-E-E-N ¶

22:59.426 --> 23:01.159
