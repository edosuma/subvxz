WEBVTT

00:41.325 --> 00:42.525
Thirty years.

00:44.045 --> 00:45.885
I can't imagine what that
must be like for you.

00:49.565 --> 00:51.845
{\an8}If I ever find any more of that lichen,
I'll get you out.

00:53.005 --> 00:54.005
I promise.

00:54.765 --> 00:55.765
We'll show them.

00:56.485 --> 00:59.565
{\an8}We'll show them that ordinary people
can make great witches.

01:00.725 --> 01:02.205
The best witches.

01:04.045 --> 01:05.325
You believed in us.

01:06.805 --> 01:08.405
{\an8}I believe in you.

01:41.245 --> 01:43.725
<i> If I ever find any more of that</i>
<i>lichen I'll get you out.</i>

01:43.805 --> 01:47.085
<i> Until the day</i>
<i>that she let Indigo go.</i>

01:47.165 --> 01:48.925
<i> ...and that is just a statue.</i>

02:09.085 --> 02:10.044
What the...

02:10.125 --> 02:12.805
Last one to the top of the tower
gets turned to custard.

02:12.885 --> 02:14.204
Ready, set...

02:15.605 --> 02:16.805
You're not Joy.

02:21.805 --> 02:23.365
Exam stress nightmare.

02:23.925 --> 02:26.485
Me too. All night long.

02:26.565 --> 02:29.645
Even if I had a million years to study,
I still wouldn't be ready.

02:30.085 --> 02:33.725
Get your stressbusters,
guaranteed to help you concentrate!

02:34.765 --> 02:38.085
Come on girls, they're infused
with real fake magic.

02:38.765 --> 02:39.925
No, thanks.

02:40.005 --> 02:41.325
Some for Clarice?

02:41.405 --> 02:45.125
If there's one person who's not
stressing about exams, it's Clarice.

02:46.805 --> 02:48.925
Get your stressbusters!

02:53.405 --> 02:55.365
Test day! Yes!

02:58.205 --> 02:59.845
What is that?

03:05.925 --> 03:07.845
Excuse me, could you...

03:11.285 --> 03:12.405
Could you just stop?

03:16.565 --> 03:17.485
Where's Joy?

03:18.005 --> 03:20.205
-Um...
-Why are you in her room?

03:20.645 --> 03:21.765
Joy's room?

03:21.845 --> 03:23.645
Of course. The one with the bats.

03:24.925 --> 03:27.445
I don't remember
all these pictures though.

03:28.205 --> 03:30.165
What's the last thing you remember?

03:30.245 --> 03:31.645
Oh. Don't know.

03:32.645 --> 03:33.925
Things are a bit fuzzy actually.

03:35.165 --> 03:36.685
Did I get a bang on the head?

03:36.765 --> 03:38.685
I do get a lot of bangs on the head.

03:39.925 --> 03:41.165
Where did you say Joy was?

03:41.245 --> 03:42.285
I...

03:42.365 --> 03:44.525
Um, Joy isn't...

03:46.405 --> 03:47.645
Joy is not...

03:50.085 --> 03:53.045
She asked me to look out for you.

03:53.125 --> 03:56.085
Oh, okay. Indigo Moon. Indie.

03:56.165 --> 03:57.725
Mildred. Millie.

03:58.605 --> 04:00.085
Joy reckons she can get me in here,
you know.

04:00.165 --> 04:01.845
And where my friend Joy goes, I go.

04:04.685 --> 04:05.765
Have you ever ridden upside down?

04:05.845 --> 04:08.125
I'm not sure if Joy mentioned this,

04:08.205 --> 04:12.525
but the teachers are not keen
on ordinary people having magic.

04:12.885 --> 04:14.925
They will do everything they can
to take it off you.

04:15.005 --> 04:16.685
That is so not happening.

04:18.605 --> 04:22.165
Then we have to prove that you can be
as good a witch as anyone else here.

04:22.245 --> 04:24.325
So, for today you stay in my...

04:26.485 --> 04:27.565
Joy's room.

04:27.645 --> 04:28.805
All day?

04:28.885 --> 04:29.965
All day.

04:30.645 --> 04:32.885
You can't let anyone find out you're here.
Do you understand...

04:44.885 --> 04:46.725
Your mother left these behind.

04:47.165 --> 04:49.605
I thought you would want them
as she will not be back.

04:51.725 --> 04:52.925
Thank you, Miss Hardbroom.

04:53.805 --> 04:55.245
I thought I would remind you

04:55.325 --> 04:58.205
not to speak a word
of what I told you yesterday.

04:58.885 --> 05:01.285
Miss Hardbroom, would it really be so bad
if somehow the statue--

05:01.365 --> 05:02.725
Please remember.

05:02.805 --> 05:04.845
The girl almost destroyed Cackle's.

05:05.565 --> 05:08.085
It is better for everyone
that she stay where she is.

05:09.525 --> 05:10.765
Yes, Miss Hardbroom.

05:18.965 --> 05:21.805
Just Star and Tabby
fighting again.

05:28.165 --> 05:31.805
You must not be late
for your lantern duty. See to it.

05:44.765 --> 05:45.685
Indie!

05:46.285 --> 05:47.405
Indigo!

05:47.485 --> 05:52.965
Today's class will be a revision period
for this afternoon's magical assessment.

05:53.725 --> 05:57.085
This is a test of everything
you have learnt thus far at Cackle's.

05:57.565 --> 05:59.165
There have been distractions lately,

05:59.245 --> 06:01.605
but it's time now to concentrate
on our studies.

06:01.685 --> 06:04.325
This is a serious magic school,

06:04.405 --> 06:08.525
and anyone who forgets that
is welcome to find another.

06:16.805 --> 06:19.005
I think Miss Cackle's in a bad mood.

06:19.085 --> 06:22.045
Getting turned into a tiny model
does that to you.

06:22.125 --> 06:24.245
Turn to chapter four
in your books, please.

06:24.325 --> 06:25.845
What's that on the end of your nose?

06:27.005 --> 06:30.885
A cosmetic inconvenience, which will not
distract me from taking this test.

06:30.965 --> 06:32.245
You've got a bother boil.

06:33.285 --> 06:34.685
Uh, shush.

06:36.365 --> 06:39.885
No, it's a good thing.
My mum told me all about them.

06:40.605 --> 06:43.565
If you whisper a worry to a person
with one of those,

06:43.645 --> 06:45.525
your worry disappears.

06:46.645 --> 06:49.165
As long as the boil's owner
doesn't say it out loud...

06:49.725 --> 06:50.965
then it won't come back.

06:52.285 --> 06:53.325
Let's try it.

07:06.565 --> 07:09.685
I actually feel a lot less worried.

07:10.445 --> 07:11.525
Me too.

07:13.165 --> 07:15.245
I think it's getting bigger already.

07:15.965 --> 07:18.125
That's because it's absorbing the worries.

07:23.365 --> 07:26.005
Her name is Indie,
she's been a statue for years

07:26.085 --> 07:29.885
and when I used the lichen potion on my
mum, I think it must have cured her too.

07:29.965 --> 07:32.125
Millie, we really should be in class.

07:32.205 --> 07:35.765
So, you're telling us that there's another
non-magical person on the loose.

07:35.845 --> 07:37.485
I think she's gone looking
for her friend Joy.

07:37.565 --> 07:38.525
Who's Joy?

07:38.605 --> 07:40.845
Joy is... long gone.

07:41.405 --> 07:43.645
And Indie doesn't know
any time has passed.

07:43.725 --> 07:46.245
I couldn't tell her,
I thought it might scare her off.

07:46.325 --> 07:47.445
What about her family?

07:48.205 --> 07:49.325
I don't think she has any.

07:50.405 --> 07:52.405
That must be why
her best friend's so important to her.

07:52.485 --> 07:53.685
Best friend who isn't here anymore?

07:55.205 --> 07:56.045
No.

07:56.125 --> 07:59.245
What if that's too much for Indie?
What if she does a Julie Hubble?

07:59.325 --> 08:01.485
Enid! It's not going to be like that.

08:01.565 --> 08:03.205
I got through to my mum and she was fine.

08:03.525 --> 08:04.885
That's not what everyone else thinks.

08:05.885 --> 08:07.405
Your mum's the talk of the school.

08:08.045 --> 08:10.605
My mum's worried that hanging around
with you is affecting my grades.

08:12.565 --> 08:14.925
Mum was fine. Indie will be fine too.

08:15.845 --> 08:17.485
But why is she your responsibility?

08:20.965 --> 08:22.165
Millie, wait!

08:30.125 --> 08:31.885
Woah!

08:32.325 --> 08:33.965
Protection potion.

08:34.044 --> 08:35.924
The delicate blend of ingredients,

08:36.005 --> 08:39.205
including scorpion sting
and cockroach shell,

08:39.284 --> 08:41.365
produces a potion so potent,

08:41.445 --> 08:45.005
it can protect from burns, bruises,
broken bones...

08:45.804 --> 08:47.325
all manner of ills.

08:47.405 --> 08:49.085
What about art teachers?

08:51.805 --> 08:56.085
When created correctly,
the potion turns a brilliant blue.

08:57.205 --> 09:00.005
As it is devilishly difficult to concoct,

09:00.085 --> 09:05.005
I have decided to award a certificate
of merit to any young witch who succeeds.

09:07.325 --> 09:08.685
You may begin brewing.

09:11.965 --> 09:13.805
This is exactly what I need

09:13.885 --> 09:16.125
to get back onto my parents' good side.

09:16.965 --> 09:20.805
Did you know they're talking about
hiring a tutor for the summer holidays?

09:20.885 --> 09:24.245
How can you even think about that
right now? We've still got to find Indie.

09:24.325 --> 09:26.165
I have problems too, you know.

09:31.045 --> 09:31.925
Land!

09:34.445 --> 09:36.765
Stop!

09:38.165 --> 09:39.045
I did it.

09:40.805 --> 09:41.805
Uh-oh.

09:45.405 --> 09:46.565
Woah!

09:46.645 --> 09:48.045
She must be here somewhere.

09:48.645 --> 09:52.365
At the end of the day, non-magicals
don't have the upbringing to be witches.

09:53.325 --> 09:55.605
They just don't have the class.

09:57.965 --> 09:59.365
No sign.

10:24.965 --> 10:27.125
Do any of you know Joy?

10:27.205 --> 10:28.285
Who are you?

10:28.365 --> 10:29.605
She's...

10:30.365 --> 10:31.565
my cousin.

10:33.565 --> 10:34.605
Another Hubble?

10:45.285 --> 10:46.645
I've got customers for you.

10:47.445 --> 10:49.525
How much for one minute
with the bother boil?

10:56.965 --> 10:59.725
Since when was there
another magical Hubble?

10:59.805 --> 11:03.205
I'm a Moon, actually. Indigo Moon.

11:04.125 --> 11:05.845
Indie's magic didn't show up till later.

11:06.325 --> 11:08.285
Like, like mine actually.

11:08.365 --> 11:09.725
It was a surprise to all of us.

11:09.805 --> 11:11.125
Why is she here?

11:11.205 --> 11:14.205
Oh, you know, I'm just showing her around.

11:14.925 --> 11:16.005
She's thinking about applying.

11:16.085 --> 11:17.125
Aren't you?

11:17.205 --> 11:18.445
Come on.

11:19.205 --> 11:21.445
-Why did you say I was your cousin?
-Just trust me, okay.

11:21.525 --> 11:23.005
I don't believe this.

11:23.085 --> 11:26.845
Your mother turns us all into ornaments,
and what's the result?

11:26.925 --> 11:28.845
They allow another one in.

11:29.645 --> 11:31.245
Have we learnt nothing?

11:31.325 --> 11:33.045
I'm learning that you're a fruitcake.

11:33.125 --> 11:34.245
No.

11:34.325 --> 11:36.085
I mean, look what happens
when she tries to fly.

11:36.165 --> 11:38.005
I could outfly you any day.

11:38.085 --> 11:38.925
What?

11:39.645 --> 11:40.845
You're challenging a Hallow?

11:40.925 --> 11:44.525
If that means you... then yeah.

11:45.485 --> 11:49.085
So, you'll have no problem facing me
in the Cackle Run?

11:52.325 --> 11:53.565
No problem at all.

11:53.645 --> 11:55.525
Wait, I don't think Indigo knows that--

11:55.605 --> 11:58.045
Alright. One hour from now.

11:58.725 --> 12:00.125
Don't forget your broomstick.

12:00.205 --> 12:01.645
And your bandages.

12:05.445 --> 12:08.925
What part of not letting anyone find out
you're here did you not understand?

12:13.205 --> 12:14.405
What's the Cackle run?

12:20.685 --> 12:21.645
Clarice?

12:22.125 --> 12:24.045
Shouldn't you be on your way to the exam?

12:25.645 --> 12:26.965
What's wrong?

12:27.045 --> 12:28.445
This is a bother boil.

12:28.525 --> 12:31.325
Which means I have
to keep other people's worries to myself,

12:31.405 --> 12:34.245
otherwise they'll return to the people
who trusted me with them.

12:34.325 --> 12:35.365
Ah, I see.

12:35.445 --> 12:38.445
But now I've got all these worries
that I've never even thought of before.

12:39.245 --> 12:42.165
I'm worried I'm going to fail my exam
and I can't even talk about it.

12:43.245 --> 12:45.005
Well, actually, there is another way.

12:46.485 --> 12:48.565
You can tell another person
with a bother boil,

12:48.645 --> 12:50.325
and the worry transfers.

12:51.245 --> 12:52.925
But I don't know anyone who has one.

12:53.045 --> 12:53.885
I've got one.

12:55.205 --> 12:57.405
Well, you can't see it,
because it's under my hair.

12:57.885 --> 12:59.005
So I can tell you?

12:59.085 --> 13:01.325
And the worries
won't return to bother anyone?

13:02.525 --> 13:04.365
Beatrice is worried
about needing the toilet.

13:04.445 --> 13:08.725
Sybil's worried about misunderstanding
a question and realizing too late.

13:08.805 --> 13:10.005
It's growing, carry on.

13:10.925 --> 13:13.005
Mabel's worried
she'll go to the wrong room.

13:13.765 --> 13:15.685
Mia's worried
she'll have a complete blank,

13:16.245 --> 13:18.805
and Ella's worried
that she's not worried enough.

13:18.885 --> 13:21.405
And Henrietta, well, Henrietta...

13:23.085 --> 13:24.045
"The Cackle Run.

13:24.125 --> 13:26.725
"A breakneck broomstick race
through woods, rivers and ravines.

13:26.805 --> 13:30.805
Banned since 1897 when
two foolhardy young witches attempted it."

13:30.885 --> 13:34.645
"They got past Twisted Wood.
They scraped through Old Sewer Bridge.

13:34.725 --> 13:38.205
But like all who'd tried before,
they couldn't beat Crooknose Corner."

13:38.645 --> 13:40.925
"The final, impossible
hairpin bend."

13:41.405 --> 13:44.445
"All that was left
were two squashed hats."

13:45.485 --> 13:46.925
There's no way you're doing this.

13:47.005 --> 13:49.085
You can't even miss a chimney,
never mind all those trees!

13:49.165 --> 13:50.885
I don't care. I'm racing.

13:50.965 --> 13:52.045
You'll get hurt.

13:52.125 --> 13:53.245
And what if the teachers find out?

13:53.325 --> 13:54.965
You'll never be allowed to stay here.

13:55.045 --> 13:57.325
You think I'd stay here
if everyone had me down as a chicken?

13:58.725 --> 14:00.325
So are you going to help me or not?

14:00.885 --> 14:01.765
Not me.

14:04.325 --> 14:06.645
I can't risk a whole summer of misery

14:06.725 --> 14:09.885
for someone who wants
to throw themselves at hard objects.

14:16.925 --> 14:19.325
Okay. What about you two?

14:35.245 --> 14:37.085
So glad I told her to keep a low profile.

14:37.605 --> 14:39.085
Thirty minutes to start time.

14:45.325 --> 14:47.205
Now this is a broomstick.

14:51.085 --> 14:52.885
<i> Simulator loading.</i>

14:52.965 --> 14:54.605
Ten minutes to start.

14:57.525 --> 14:58.725
Twisted Wood.

14:59.405 --> 15:00.525
Dodge and weave.

15:06.365 --> 15:07.605
Old Sewer Bridge.

15:08.165 --> 15:10.605
Smooth and steady.

15:20.125 --> 15:21.165
Crooknose Corner.

15:26.165 --> 15:27.085
Turn.

15:27.445 --> 15:28.645
Turn!

15:44.325 --> 15:45.645
Nice recce, Stormy.

15:47.005 --> 15:48.325
Look at that.

15:48.405 --> 15:51.365
Not one of the protection potions
turned blue.

15:54.125 --> 15:55.565
Except mine.

15:57.765 --> 15:59.325
Ethel. No.

15:59.405 --> 16:00.765
Enid. A-ha.

16:06.965 --> 16:09.085
Bring on the merit award.

16:11.965 --> 16:14.685
Oh, don't look at me like that. Come on.

16:20.885 --> 16:22.285
Seven minutes.

16:22.845 --> 16:23.845
Crooknose Corner.

16:35.125 --> 16:36.285
What are you doing?

16:37.245 --> 16:40.525
Ridding the school of Hubble
the Second before she even begins.

16:41.685 --> 16:43.085
Only one potion worked.

16:44.085 --> 16:45.005
Obviously mine.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.485
That's not yours, that's Enid's.

16:47.965 --> 16:48.805
Oh well.

16:48.885 --> 16:51.965
Wait. You're going to use
the protection potion on yourself?

16:52.365 --> 16:55.645
You didn't think I'd rely
on legitimate tactics, did you?

16:57.325 --> 17:00.165
Scorpion sting and cockroach shell,

17:00.925 --> 17:03.645
from all harm protect me well.

17:05.244 --> 17:08.045
What about the other girl? Indigo.
She's going to get hurt.

17:16.484 --> 17:17.604
Crooknose Corner.

17:18.885 --> 17:20.084
Uh...

17:20.165 --> 17:21.244
just hope for the best?

17:25.525 --> 17:27.964
You can't go through with this, Indie,
it's too risky.

17:28.045 --> 17:29.525
You know what's risky?

17:29.604 --> 17:31.645
Having no one there at all

17:31.725 --> 17:32.885
to look out for you.

17:33.645 --> 17:35.405
Here, I've got a friend,

17:35.485 --> 17:38.005
who did more than just look out for me.

17:38.085 --> 17:40.005
She gave me magic.

17:40.085 --> 17:42.405
So it's a risk worth taking.

17:46.565 --> 17:48.565
Millie, we've got to stop this.

17:49.125 --> 17:51.565
She's doing this because of Joy,
and there is no Joy.

17:51.645 --> 17:53.205
You should tell her the truth.

17:57.485 --> 18:00.325
Take your seats please, girls.

18:01.165 --> 18:04.885
The magical assessment will begin shortly.

18:10.365 --> 18:12.485
Where have you been?
Everyone's been looking for you.

18:12.565 --> 18:14.005
We had some last-minute worries.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.125
You may begin.

18:40.685 --> 18:41.605
She's here!

18:48.005 --> 18:50.485
What is that?

18:50.565 --> 18:52.045
A flying scrapheap?

18:52.125 --> 18:54.925
You can't ride an ordinary broomstick
like this.

18:55.405 --> 18:58.245
Ride how you like. You'll never win.

18:59.125 --> 19:00.805
Let's do this.

19:02.045 --> 19:03.165
I thought you were keeping away.

19:03.805 --> 19:08.845
If there's the slightest possibility
that Ethel gets trashed, then I'm in.

19:08.925 --> 19:10.005
Indie, wait.

19:10.685 --> 19:11.765
You can't do this.

19:12.765 --> 19:14.165
There's something I haven't told you.

19:14.245 --> 19:16.445
Felicity, will you start the race, please.

19:16.845 --> 19:19.365
-I should have told you before, but--
-Felicity?

19:20.165 --> 19:21.165
On your marks...

19:22.205 --> 19:24.125
The magic did something bad to you.

19:24.205 --> 19:25.165
Get set.

19:25.245 --> 19:26.965
It turned you to stone, Indie.

19:28.405 --> 19:29.925
You were like a statue.

19:31.165 --> 19:32.405
A lot of time passed.

19:33.485 --> 19:34.405
Thirty years.

19:37.325 --> 19:40.685
The Joy you remember... she's long gone.

19:42.365 --> 19:44.885
Hello? She said, "get set."

19:47.005 --> 19:48.405
You know what?

19:48.485 --> 19:49.645
I don't need this.

19:50.925 --> 19:51.765
What is she doing?

19:51.845 --> 19:53.485
-That's rubbish.
-Why?

19:53.565 --> 19:54.925
What?

19:55.005 --> 19:55.965
What are you doing?

19:56.525 --> 19:57.845
No race, no point.

19:58.365 --> 20:00.045
I'm not staying.

20:00.125 --> 20:01.645
There has to be a race.

20:01.725 --> 20:02.925
I demand it!

20:03.965 --> 20:06.245
Oh. This was my moment.

20:07.885 --> 20:10.925
Fine. I'll do the Cackle Run myself.

20:11.565 --> 20:13.125
Ethel, no!

20:14.645 --> 20:16.285
Don't worry about her.

20:16.365 --> 20:18.365
She used Enid's protection potion.

20:18.445 --> 20:20.605
-My protection potion?
-You mean she's cheating?

20:20.685 --> 20:21.965
She's protected?

20:22.845 --> 20:25.005
No. I was cheating.

20:26.485 --> 20:27.445
She's not protected.

20:28.325 --> 20:29.645
She just thinks she is.

20:29.725 --> 20:31.565
She's going to break her neck.

20:34.405 --> 20:35.525
Fly!

20:35.605 --> 20:36.885
Indigo, no!

21:02.165 --> 21:03.245
Year three, I...

21:27.205 --> 21:29.245
You're not protected!

21:31.765 --> 21:32.885
Oh, no!

21:38.445 --> 21:40.885
Ethel! Crooknose Corner! Stop!

21:45.165 --> 21:46.125
Where's Millie?

22:04.245 --> 22:06.405
Ethel, the potion didn't work!

22:06.485 --> 22:07.405
What?

22:07.485 --> 22:08.925
You're not protected!

22:11.165 --> 22:12.325
Oh, no!

22:18.685 --> 22:19.525
Stop!

22:40.125 --> 22:41.925
Hold on.

22:49.645 --> 22:50.645
Here they come.

22:50.845 --> 22:52.245
Millie, what the...

22:55.045 --> 22:56.605
They survived Crooknose Corner?

22:57.245 --> 22:58.325
The Cackle Run!

22:58.405 --> 22:59.805
Everyone, back inside.

23:00.485 --> 23:01.525
Come on, Millie.

23:04.085 --> 23:05.845
You know your problem, Ethel?

23:07.005 --> 23:08.565
You just don't have the class.

23:11.205 --> 23:12.605
They've done it, they're going to win.

23:22.645 --> 23:23.725
What is the meaning of...

23:25.005 --> 23:27.405
Hello, I'm Indigo Moon.

23:27.485 --> 23:28.485
Who are you?

23:33.005 --> 23:35.245
Five, four,

23:36.125 --> 23:37.605
three,

23:37.685 --> 23:38.965
two,

23:39.045 --> 23:39.925
one!

23:40.485 --> 23:41.805
Heron attack!

23:44.085 --> 23:46.125
Oh, uh, sorry.

23:46.205 --> 23:48.845
Just, uh... Just dreaming about the pond.

23:48.925 --> 23:50.285
Pens down now, please.

23:50.365 --> 23:52.845
That was... not terrible.

23:53.405 --> 23:55.485
I didn't even think about
going to the toilet.

23:55.565 --> 23:57.485
You may file out quietly now, girls.

23:58.165 --> 24:00.365
I understood all the questions.

24:02.005 --> 24:03.685
I think.

24:04.485 --> 24:05.565
All okay?

24:05.645 --> 24:08.245
It was fine, Miss Drill.
Thanks to your bother boil.

24:09.125 --> 24:10.765
I don't have a bother boil.

24:12.325 --> 24:13.685
Because they aren't real.

24:13.765 --> 24:16.805
Your boil is probably
from too many late nights studying.

24:16.885 --> 24:19.845
But, Miss Drill, it worked.
It took my worries away.

24:19.925 --> 24:22.765
Sharing your worries
is what took them away.

24:22.845 --> 24:26.085
Keeping them to yourself
is the worst thing you can do.

24:26.165 --> 24:29.285
Oh, and I'd get some non-magical
witch hazel on that.

24:29.365 --> 24:30.645
It'll go away in no time.

24:30.725 --> 24:31.965
Thanks, Miss Drill.

24:32.525 --> 24:33.885
No worries.

24:41.445 --> 24:45.885
Did I not tell you that I never wanted
to hear the name Indigo Moon again?

24:45.965 --> 24:49.125
It was an accident, Miss Hardbroom.
But I'm glad that it happened.

24:49.485 --> 24:50.365
Glad?

24:51.085 --> 24:53.445
The girl is a threat to us all.

24:53.525 --> 24:54.965
She could be a great witch.

24:55.045 --> 24:56.605
She wants to learn.

24:56.685 --> 24:59.445
The only thing she will be learning
is the spell for relinquishing her magic.

24:59.525 --> 25:01.005
It should never have been given to her.

25:01.085 --> 25:03.845
It is a mistake I have regretted
ever since.

25:03.925 --> 25:07.165
We have no way of knowing
that she is able to use magic responsibly.

25:07.245 --> 25:08.085
Miss Cackle.

25:08.165 --> 25:10.725
Indie did the Cackle Run for one reason.

25:11.405 --> 25:13.525
To save Ethel Hallow from injury.

25:13.605 --> 25:14.925
At great risk to herself.

25:15.005 --> 25:18.165
And if that's not using magic responsibly,
then I don't know what is.

25:18.245 --> 25:19.405
Mildred Hubble!

25:19.485 --> 25:21.285
She has nowhere else to go!

25:27.685 --> 25:30.405
Since you want to take responsibility
for her...

25:32.445 --> 25:33.725
I will allow it.

25:36.565 --> 25:38.405
The girl does not belong here.

25:39.285 --> 25:40.485
And she never will.

25:48.205 --> 25:50.605
That is not all that you will have to do.

25:51.685 --> 25:56.005
You will also ensure that Indigo studies
for her basic Witching Proficiency exam.

25:56.085 --> 25:58.925
You will make sure she passes,
and most of all...

26:00.125 --> 26:02.125
you will keep her out of trouble.

26:02.845 --> 26:03.845
Yes, Miss Cackle.

26:03.925 --> 26:05.765
And if she fails at any of those things,

26:05.845 --> 26:09.645
then you too will have failed and neither
of you will have a place at Cackle's.

26:11.845 --> 26:14.125
I have had enough of your defiance,
Mildred.

26:14.645 --> 26:18.525
Indigo Moon is your last chance.

26:39.605 --> 26:43.085
I wish you the very best of luck,
Mildred Hubble.

26:45.165 --> 26:46.125
You will need it.

26:50.165 --> 26:51.365
Okay.

26:51.445 --> 26:54.005
Can we work on how to brake?
