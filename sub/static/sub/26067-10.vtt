Previously on the Truth about
the Harry Quebert Affair...

00:08.586 --> 00:09.728
Chief Pratt
killed himself?

00:09.828 --> 00:11.690
You'd think so, but no.

00:11.790 --> 00:13.011
Murdered.

00:13.111 --> 00:14.533
A couple of good whacks
at the back of the head.

00:14.633 --> 00:15.694
That's like Nola.

00:15.794 --> 00:16.935
Pratt was protecting
somebody

00:17.035 --> 00:18.617
who was afraid
that now he'd talk.

00:18.717 --> 00:20.019
Found fingerprints
on the gas can,

00:20.119 --> 00:22.121
but no match...

00:24.804 --> 00:27.166
...which means it was someone
with no police record.

00:28.528 --> 00:29.589
Hello?

00:29.689 --> 00:30.910
The arsonist who set fire
to Harry's house

00:31.010 --> 00:33.013
was arrested tonight.

00:33.813 --> 00:35.596
We found a handgun

00:35.696 --> 00:37.718
and a necklace
with Nola's name on it

00:37.818 --> 00:40.641
in Montburry Lake.

00:40.741 --> 00:43.444
Any idea how they
got there, Mr. Quinn?

00:43.544 --> 00:46.808
The black Monte Carlo
at the scene of the crime,

00:46.908 --> 00:48.650
that was yours
all along, wasn't it?

00:48.750 --> 00:50.532
Look at the headline.

00:50.632 --> 00:52.454
Nixon resigned in August, 1974.

00:52.554 --> 00:53.735
There is no way

00:53.835 --> 00:55.737
that that photo was
taken in August, 1975.

00:55.837 --> 00:57.059
Who are you protecting?

00:57.159 --> 00:59.161
[♪♪♪♪♪]

00:59.962 --> 01:01.964
And that's
when I found them...

01:02.725 --> 01:04.747
the letters
between Harry and Nola

01:04.847 --> 01:06.549
that he'd stolen.

01:06.649 --> 01:08.351
[Kellergan]: I found these
after she disappeared.

01:08.451 --> 01:10.874
They're all from Harry Quebert.

01:10.974 --> 01:12.435
They're all the letters
in his book,

01:12.535 --> 01:14.237
"The Origin of Evil."

01:14.337 --> 01:16.239
[Harry]: I've given you
everything.

01:16.339 --> 01:20.564
The truth is
in your hands.

01:20.664 --> 01:21.705
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

01:21.785 --> 01:24.769
This is " The Origin of Evil ."

01:24.869 --> 01:27.572
The moment I've been dreading
for 33 years.

" The Seagulls of Sommerdale "

You know, once
they find their mate,

01:35.921 --> 01:37.262
they stay together for life.

01:37.362 --> 01:40.025
I think you should put
seagulls in your book.

01:40.125 --> 01:41.587
If you want,

01:41.687 --> 01:43.189
I'll put them

I'm just a ghost now.

03:51.267 --> 03:53.269
[chuckles wryly]

03:54.230 --> 03:58.455
It's the first time
I've been to your place.

03:58.555 --> 03:59.336
It's impressive.

03:59.436 --> 04:00.257

Not until the day...

05:30.174 --> 05:33.177
not until the day Nola's body
was found at Goose Cove.

05:34.819 --> 05:38.483
The whole town
was in such a frenzy.

05:38.583 --> 05:40.045
I started...

05:40.145 --> 05:41.246
I started to feel sick,

05:41.346 --> 05:43.348
so I went home
earlier than usual...

05:45.430 --> 05:47.333
[Travis]: I can't believe
this doesn't scare you!

05:47.433 --> 05:49.094
This whole thing
could explode at us!

-I'm not calming down!

Calm down! No one
is going to suspect.

All roads lead to Quebert!

05:57.203 --> 05:58.344
The body's on his property.

found not guilty?

06:55.306 --> 06:57.168
I don't know how
to tell you this.

06:57.268 --> 06:59.210
Okay.

06:59.310 --> 07:02.474
I know how Nola
Kellergan was killed.

07:22.375 --> 07:24.377
[gasps]

07:25.739 --> 07:27.481
[Jenny]: He told me
what they'd done...

07:27.581 --> 07:29.083
Don't worry.

07:29.183 --> 07:30.804
I'll take care
of everything.

07:30.904 --> 07:33.607
[Jenny]: ...And that
he kept Nola's necklace

07:33.707 --> 07:35.570
all these years

07:35.670 --> 07:37.672
so he'd never forget.

07:38.913 --> 07:40.575
I had to protect him.

07:40.675 --> 07:43.899
He was all I had.

07:43.999 --> 07:46.662
But then...

07:46.762 --> 07:49.905
Except when Marcus Goldman came,

07:50.005 --> 07:52.868
started stirring everything up,

07:52.968 --> 07:55.431
I panicked.

07:55.531 --> 07:58.094
I wanted him gone!

07:59.616 --> 08:03.280
I sent him those
threatening messages.

08:03.380 --> 08:07.244
I set fire to Harry's car.

08:07.344 --> 08:11.068
But he ignored
my warnings, so...

08:12.549 --> 08:17.295
Jenny started
acting strange...

08:17.395 --> 08:19.898

08:19.998 --> 08:24.062
after Nola's body
was discovered.

08:24.162 --> 08:26.304
I'd ask her what was wrong,

08:26.404 --> 08:30.149
but she...
she wouldn't tell me.

08:30.249 --> 08:35.074
And then, one evening,
I was up,

08:35.174 --> 08:38.317
going to the bathroom,
and, uh...

08:38.417 --> 08:42.122
I saw her car
drive by the house.

08:42.222 --> 08:45.365
I was worried sick
about my little girl.

08:45.465 --> 08:47.988
I wanted to know
where she was going.

Go away!

09:51.817 --> 09:56.182
After Pratt confessed
to sexually assaulting Nola...

09:58.064 --> 10:01.667
he had nothing left to lose.

10:03.469 --> 10:07.394
I could see
he was about to crack.

10:08.715 --> 10:10.577
One day, he calls me.

10:10.677 --> 10:12.539
He said...

10:12.639 --> 10:14.642
we should talk.

10:16.524 --> 10:18.426
So I-I went to see him.

10:18.526 --> 10:21.029
You're panicking, Gareth.

10:21.129 --> 10:22.590
They don't have anything
tying you to Nola,

10:22.690 --> 10:24.272
other than
a fuckin' blow job.

You have to do
what's right for you.

10:45.114 --> 10:47.297

Maybe then
I'll have some peace

how did Robert Quinn
end up with the gun

11:22.835 --> 11:24.837
and Nola's necklace?

11:27.400 --> 11:30.424
Jenny.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.706
She thought that if...

11:32.806 --> 11:35.709
the investigation
turned to us,

11:35.809 --> 11:38.632
well, we'd be screwed.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.034
So she...

11:40.134 --> 11:44.178
she asked her father
to get rid of them in the...

11:46.661 --> 11:49.024
And you let him
take the blame?

"The Origin of Evil"?

13:21.323 --> 13:23.326

13:28.932 --> 13:31.154
It was Elijah Stern,

14:02.208 --> 14:04.871
This is how
"The Origin of Evil" begins.

14:04.971 --> 14:08.074
With this... this letter
from Nola to Harry.

14:08.174 --> 14:11.277
He kept all the letters
that Luther had stolen,

14:11.377 --> 14:14.641

14:14.741 --> 14:18.806
I suddenly realized
there's, uh...

14:18.906 --> 14:20.487
there's not one mention
of a seagull

14:20.587 --> 14:23.651
in "The Origin of Evil,"

14:23.751 --> 14:24.892

You know, the book
you wrote that summer,

14:41.570 --> 14:42.551
this may interest you.

14:42.651 --> 14:44.513
This book is the truth. Harry."

14:44.613 --> 14:46.896
"The Seagulls of Sommerdale
by Harry L. Quebert."

14:48.418 --> 14:49.319
Hmm.

14:49.419 --> 14:51.641
It's an unpublished
book of Harry's.

14:51.741 --> 14:53.523
I don't know, he always said
Nola loved seagulls.

14:53.623 --> 14:54.765
There must be some connection.

14:54.865 --> 14:56.867
But what does that mean,
"This book is the truth"?

14:57.788 --> 14:59.690
And you used me

14:59.790 --> 15:00.951
back when you asked me
to burn that manuscript

15:01.031 --> 15:02.653
of "The Origin of Evil"
because...

15:02.753 --> 15:04.755
it wasn't your handwriting.

15:07.358 --> 15:09.360
[Harry]: Bravo, Marcus.

15:11.282 --> 15:13.365
Bravo.

15:14.646 --> 15:16.588
You didn't write the book
that made you famous.

15:16.688 --> 15:18.470
You stole it

15:18.570 --> 15:20.272
from Luther Caleb.

15:20.372 --> 15:23.155
"The Origin of Evil"...

15:23.255 --> 15:25.478
You know, I never understood

15:25.578 --> 15:28.081
why such a beautiful book

15:28.181 --> 15:30.003
had such an ominous title,

15:30.103 --> 15:31.724
and...

15:31.824 --> 15:34.487
I was embarrassed to ask you.

15:34.587 --> 15:36.570
It's the origin
of evil

15:36.670 --> 15:38.292
that destroyed
your life.

15:38.392 --> 15:40.734
That's enough, Marcus.

15:40.834 --> 15:41.835
The title had nothing
to do with the book.

15:41.915 --> 15:44.518
It was about you.

15:46.640 --> 15:48.583
The first letter Nola sent you,

15:48.683 --> 15:50.104
on July 5th,

15:50.204 --> 15:51.386
when you were trying
to break it off with her,

15:51.486 --> 15:53.768
you never received it.

15:56.731 --> 15:59.454
[♪♪♪♪♪]

16:06.422 --> 16:09.605
[Marcus]: Luther
had been spying on you.

16:09.705 --> 16:11.808
He took the letter,

16:11.908 --> 16:14.411
and from that day on,
he began writing Nola,

16:14.511 --> 16:17.734
pretending to be you.

16:17.834 --> 16:19.736
At night, he would retrieve
your discarded pages

16:19.836 --> 16:21.739
in order to study the way
you shaped your words.

16:21.839 --> 16:23.380
He was an artist,

16:23.480 --> 16:26.824
so he was skillful
at copying your handwriting.

16:26.924 --> 16:29.026
He even suggested
the umbrella stand

16:29.126 --> 16:30.428
as the place to hide
her letters to you

16:30.528 --> 16:34.412
so he would find them first.

16:38.577 --> 16:40.639
He took all the letters
she wrote you

16:40.739 --> 16:41.840
before you even saw them,

16:41.940 --> 16:46.806
and replied again and again,

16:46.906 --> 16:49.308
always as you.

16:53.753 --> 16:54.854
And the whole summer,

16:54.954 --> 16:57.497
it was her unknowing
correspondence

16:57.597 --> 16:59.620
with Luther Caleb

16:59.720 --> 17:01.722
that became
"The Origin of Evil."

17:06.607 --> 17:08.609
Harry?

17:11.893 --> 17:13.895
How could you do such a thing?

17:20.782 --> 17:23.145
I panicked.

17:25.948 --> 17:30.493
I was struggling with
"The Seagulls of Sommerdale,"

17:30.593 --> 17:35.318
despite Nola thinking
how great it was.

17:37.761 --> 17:40.864
And then
Luther showed up

17:40.964 --> 17:42.426
with a manuscript

17:42.526 --> 17:44.348
that he had written,

17:44.448 --> 17:46.871
asking me for my advice.

17:46.971 --> 17:48.973
[Harry's doorbell rings]

17:56.821 --> 17:58.823
Oh!

17:59.744 --> 18:01.486
Luther, what's up?

18:01.586 --> 18:03.529
Uh... I was
wondering

18:03.629 --> 18:05.090
if I could
ask you a favor?

18:05.190 --> 18:06.892
Yeah, please,
come on in, I'm sorry.

18:06.992 --> 18:07.773
It's okay.

18:07.873 --> 18:09.875
Come on in.

18:10.676 --> 18:11.778
What can I do for you?

18:11.878 --> 18:12.899
It's...

18:12.999 --> 18:13.900
I've written
something,

18:14.000 --> 18:15.542
and, uh...

18:15.642 --> 18:16.863
I-- it's a love story,

18:16.963 --> 18:18.705
and I don't know
if it's any good, but I was...

18:18.805 --> 18:19.746
I was wondering
if you...

18:19.846 --> 18:20.787
if you might
be willing to...

18:20.887 --> 18:22.109
to read it?

18:22.209 --> 18:24.872
Yes, of course,
it'd be my pleasure.

18:24.972 --> 18:25.873
Thank you.

18:25.973 --> 18:27.995
Uh...

18:28.095 --> 18:29.557
I've, uh... [sniffs]

18:29.657 --> 18:31.919
I've brought the handwritten
copy by mistake.

18:32.019 --> 18:32.920
I can go--

18:33.020 --> 18:33.962
No, that's...
that's all right,

18:34.062 --> 18:35.964
as long as it's legible.

18:36.064 --> 18:37.726
Why don't you just let me
read the whole thing,

18:37.826 --> 18:38.767
and then I'll...

18:38.867 --> 18:39.768
I'll let you know
what I think.

18:39.868 --> 18:41.289
Okay?

18:41.389 --> 18:43.392
Thank you.

18:44.833 --> 18:46.135
[clears throat]

18:46.235 --> 18:46.896
Thank you.

18:46.996 --> 18:48.998
Yeah.

19:00.891 --> 19:03.573
[Nola calls]:
Harry?

19:06.016 --> 19:08.018
Harry!

19:08.339 --> 19:10.341
Harry?

19:12.343 --> 19:13.644
Harry!

19:13.744 --> 19:15.927
[Harry reads]:
"My sweet darling girl,

19:16.027 --> 19:18.129
today, I came
to your house at dawn,

19:18.229 --> 19:20.772
as I often do, I must confess.

19:20.872 --> 19:22.814
I watched you at a distance,

19:22.914 --> 19:24.857
obscured within
a forest of shadows--"

19:24.957 --> 19:26.258
[Nola]:
Harry?

19:26.358 --> 19:27.579
[Harry reading]: "--around me,

19:27.679 --> 19:29.742
the leaves stirred
in their trees,

19:29.842 --> 19:32.144
and called out, 'Go to her,'

19:32.244 --> 19:34.547
but I remained hidden.

19:34.647 --> 19:36.269
There are things we long to do,
but must not do."

19:36.369 --> 19:37.430
I've been calling you

19:37.530 --> 19:39.552
for the last
10 minutes.

19:39.652 --> 19:41.655
I'm sorry.

19:42.055 --> 19:43.837
I didn't hear you.

19:43.937 --> 19:46.440
Are those the new pages?

19:46.540 --> 19:48.402
I can type
them up.

19:48.502 --> 19:51.005
No, not yet.

19:51.105 --> 19:53.107
They're not ready yet.

19:56.190 --> 19:59.494
It was the most beautiful book
I'd ever read in my life.

19:59.594 --> 20:02.297
The most extraordinary
love story,

20:02.397 --> 20:04.059
our love story,

20:04.159 --> 20:05.380
with those
remarkable letters

20:05.480 --> 20:07.703
woven in between.

20:07.803 --> 20:12.989
I had no idea that...
it was written for Nola,

20:13.089 --> 20:14.030
that the letters in it

20:14.130 --> 20:16.432
were Nola's.

20:16.532 --> 20:18.715
But the story itself
was so powerful,

20:18.815 --> 20:20.397
so painfully human,

20:20.497 --> 20:22.879
I just...

20:22.979 --> 20:25.842
just couldn't believe
how beautiful it was.

20:25.942 --> 20:28.505
And so you claimed it
as your own.

20:31.829 --> 20:34.532
Yes.

20:34.632 --> 20:37.996
About a week later,
there was an accident.

20:41.039 --> 20:42.020
And I found out

20:42.120 --> 20:45.844
that it was Luther
who was in the car.

20:49.047 --> 20:52.691
I hadn't had time
to give it back to him, so...

20:55.334 --> 20:57.537
I claimed it as my own.

20:59.979 --> 21:01.361
I just could not
have imagined

21:01.461 --> 21:02.762
what a huge success

21:02.862 --> 21:04.865
it would become.

21:09.550 --> 21:12.713
It ruined my life.

21:14.075 --> 21:17.859
So you let yourself
be accused of murder

21:17.959 --> 21:20.782
rather than just reveal
the truth about the manuscript?

21:20.882 --> 21:23.305
My whole life had been
built on a lie,

21:23.405 --> 21:26.528
don't you see that?

21:31.774 --> 21:35.117
I still have no idea
how she got the book.

21:35.217 --> 21:36.879
It's simple, Harry.

21:36.979 --> 21:38.081
He left
the typewritten version

21:38.181 --> 21:40.763
in her mailbox.

21:40.863 --> 21:42.365
He knew you guys were
going away together.

21:42.465 --> 21:44.568
He knew that she was gonna
elope with you,

21:44.668 --> 21:46.970
and so that's how
he ended the book,

21:47.070 --> 21:49.072
with the heroine's
departure.

21:52.116 --> 21:53.577
[Marcus]: The manuscript ended

21:53.677 --> 21:54.558
with a final letter
he'd written to Nola,

21:54.638 --> 21:56.741
wishing her a good life.

21:56.841 --> 21:58.423
He put a copy
of that final letter

21:58.523 --> 22:01.105
in the package along with
the typed manuscript

22:01.205 --> 22:03.608
so she'd read the letter
as soon as she opened it.

22:21.427 --> 22:24.451
In your own words...

what happened

22:31.278 --> 22:34.061
This is the story of parents

22:34.161 --> 22:38.025
who refused to see the truth
about their child...

22:38.125 --> 22:39.827
It's the story of a man

22:39.927 --> 22:41.870
who, out of entitlement
and arrogance,

22:41.970 --> 22:44.352
destroyed the dreams
of another young man,

22:44.452 --> 22:47.075
and was forever haunted
by what he'd done.

22:47.175 --> 22:49.037
And this is the story of a man

22:49.137 --> 22:51.440
who dreamed of becoming
a great writer,

22:51.540 --> 22:55.204
but was slowly consumed
by his own ambition.

22:55.304 --> 22:58.087
This is the story of
a black Chevrolet Monte Carlo,

22:58.187 --> 23:01.771
which parked some distance
away from a house

23:01.871 --> 23:04.694
in a quiet neighborhood
of a small town in Maine.

23:04.794 --> 23:08.498
At dawn
on August 30th, 1975,

23:08.598 --> 23:11.021
Nola Kellergan
received her last letter,

was from her intended,

23:14.885 --> 23:16.887

it was a final goodbye,

that Harry had changed his mind
and was forsaking her,

23:42.795 --> 23:46.099

I can't tell you.

Of course you can, angel.

You can tell
your daddy anything.

Just so sad, Daddy.

deserve your love.

Get out, David.

Now.

25:15.135 --> 25:17.598
It's okay, Daddy.

25:17.698 --> 25:19.700
It's my punishment.

[As her mother]:
Come here, Nola.

[As her mother]:
You will do as I say.

This is the punishment

for girls who
kill their mothers.

still audible]

All day long,

25:58.983 --> 26:00.404
music blasts from the garage,

26:00.504 --> 26:02.286
but Luther doesn't move,

26:02.386 --> 26:04.088
never takes his eyes
off the house,

26:04.188 --> 26:06.811
waiting patiently
for his beloved.

26:06.911 --> 26:08.253
He'd caused her pain.

26:08.353 --> 26:09.975
He didn't understand how,

26:10.075 --> 26:11.616
but he knew
he needed to see her.

26:11.716 --> 26:13.719
He needed to apologize.

26:15.360 --> 26:17.022
At 6:00,

26:17.122 --> 26:20.526
he watches as she climbs
out of her bedroom window...

26:23.129 --> 26:25.972
She looks down the street
to make sure she's not seen...

26:29.896 --> 26:31.898
Then she begins to run.

26:42.710 --> 26:44.292
Luther?

26:44.392 --> 26:45.653
Don't cry.

26:45.753 --> 26:47.255
I just came to say

26:47.355 --> 26:49.457
that you
shouldn't cry.

Can you give me a lift?

Yes, of course.

Get in.

26:56.445 --> 26:57.426
Take me to Goose Cove.

26:57.526 --> 26:59.528
I have to see Harry.

27:01.010 --> 27:03.472
[Marcus]:
Now, neither Luther nor Nola

27:03.572 --> 27:05.475
noticed the police car
behind them.

27:05.575 --> 27:07.437
Travis was on patrol.

27:07.537 --> 27:09.559
"Why was Luther Caleb
picking up Nola?"

27:09.659 --> 27:11.281
[Travis flicks on
dispatch radio]

27:11.381 --> 27:13.043
Travis was about to call
for backup,

27:13.143 --> 27:14.524
but he decided

27:14.624 --> 27:17.087
that he would deal
with Luther himself...

27:17.187 --> 27:20.331
He doesn't love me, Luther.

27:20.431 --> 27:23.054
I thought he did,
but he doesn't.

27:23.154 --> 27:24.375
I wrote those letters.

27:24.475 --> 27:26.477
Not Harry.

27:27.358 --> 27:29.360
I didn't mean
to hurt you.

27:32.964 --> 27:35.988
I don't understand.

27:36.088 --> 27:37.349
You wrote those letters?

27:37.449 --> 27:39.451
Yes.

27:41.173 --> 27:43.175
You stole my letters to Harry?

27:44.977 --> 27:47.300
Please forgive me.

27:48.381 --> 27:49.162
No! No!

27:49.262 --> 27:50.003

27:55.509 --> 27:57.090
Get off me!

27:57.190 --> 27:59.193
I know you and Harry
are leaving.

27:59.913 --> 28:03.637
I just wanted
to say goodbye.

28:07.522 --> 28:10.705
Then that means...

28:10.805 --> 28:12.627
Harry's still waiting.

28:12.727 --> 28:14.809
We're still
going away as planned.

28:16.491 --> 28:19.715
Take me to
the By the Sea motel, Luther,

28:19.815 --> 28:21.557
on Shore Road.

28:21.657 --> 28:23.319
You're so
lucky, Nola.

28:23.419 --> 28:27.203

29:31.372 --> 29:32.594
Just got a call
from Mrs. Cooper

29:32.694 --> 29:33.475
on Side Creek Lane.

29:33.575 --> 29:34.876
I don't have time
for Mrs. Cooper.

29:34.976 --> 29:36.278
She reported
seeing a young girl

29:36.378 --> 29:37.839
being chased by a man
into the woods

29:37.939 --> 29:39.801

You think we're okay now?

30:46.413 --> 30:48.396
We should wait here
for a while.

30:48.496 --> 30:49.717

30:49.817 --> 30:51.959
I think we're safe.

30:56.825 --> 30:58.126
I'm sorry to disturb you
on your day off.

30:58.226 --> 31:00.569
I saw Luther Caleb
in Sommerdale.

31:00.669 --> 31:01.890
Yeah, again.

31:01.990 --> 31:04.733
Only this time,
he was with Nola Kellergan.

and he wouldn't let her--

Okay.

31:20.690 --> 31:22.693
[Nola]: What time is it?

31:24.054 --> 31:25.516
I'm meeting him at 8:00.

31:25.616 --> 31:28.299
I think it's okay
to go now, right?

39:24.574 --> 39:25.755
A bit too showy for me,

what are you gonna do?

39:28.017 --> 39:28.838
[chuckles]

39:28.938 --> 39:29.920
Yeah.

39:30.020 --> 39:31.561
I got one of those too.

39:31.661 --> 39:32.642
Well, you have
a good, uh...

39:32.742 --> 39:33.443

39:33.543 --> 39:34.364
Yeah.

39:34.464 --> 39:36.467

41:06.724 --> 41:08.426
Better to leave it
unsolved.

41:08.526 --> 41:11.149

Why not just pin
the whole thing on Caleb?

41:15.894 --> 41:17.936
[scoffs] And risk
involving Stern?

41:21.740 --> 41:23.562
You knew she had
psychotic episodes,

41:23.662 --> 41:25.665
didn't you?

41:27.547 --> 41:30.210
Yes. I went over to her...

41:30.310 --> 41:32.312
to talk to her father...

41:35.195 --> 41:37.417
...even though
I promised I wouldn't.

41:37.517 --> 41:38.418

41:38.518 --> 41:39.780
She's being beaten
black and blue, Reverend.

41:39.880 --> 41:41.662
You have to stop this,
or I'm gonna go to the cops.

41:41.762 --> 41:42.823
I wouldn't do that,
Mr. Quebert.

41:42.923 --> 41:44.265
The hell I will not!

41:44.365 --> 41:45.386
You don't understand.

41:45.486 --> 41:46.627
What kind of man are you

41:46.727 --> 41:48.229
to just sit back
and let your wife beat--

41:48.329 --> 41:51.452
My wife's been dead
for nine years!

41:57.619 --> 41:58.520
I don't under--

41:58.620 --> 41:59.882

Reverend?

42:02.625 --> 42:04.246
[knocking urgently]
Reverend!

42:04.346 --> 42:05.688
That's when I knew

42:05.788 --> 42:08.010
I needed to get her
out of Sommerdale...

42:08.110 --> 42:10.934
to get her the help she needed.

42:11.034 --> 42:13.697
Harry, that's why you were
running away together?

42:13.797 --> 42:14.658
Yes.

42:14.758 --> 42:18.222
I would have made sure she...

42:18.322 --> 42:21.245
had the right doctor.

42:22.526 --> 42:24.768
I would have helped her
become whole again.

42:26.771 --> 42:29.233
Why didn't you tell me
about her mother?

42:29.333 --> 42:31.316
[sighs sadly]

42:31.416 --> 42:34.279
I was so mad at you
for the leaks.

42:34.379 --> 42:37.362
I thought you had betrayed
my trust,

42:37.462 --> 42:40.245
and I was angry.

42:40.345 --> 42:42.488
I wanted that book to fail.

42:42.588 --> 42:44.450
And I knew
if you made that mistake,

42:44.550 --> 42:45.491
no one would take you seriously

42:45.591 --> 42:47.593
ever again.

42:50.677 --> 42:54.280
See, this is why I told you
we could never be friends again.

43:00.567 --> 43:04.772
You'll never look at me
the same way ever again, Marcus.

43:14.702 --> 43:19.528
Write the truth, Marcus.

43:19.628 --> 43:21.930
Write the truth
about me.

43:22.030 --> 43:23.492
Correct your book.

43:23.592 --> 43:27.596
Write the truth about
the Harry Quebert Affair.

Rumor has it

44:43.318 --> 44:44.420
you have
a new book, writer.

44:44.520 --> 44:45.981
Mm-hm. This is true, yeah.

44:46.081 --> 44:47.783
You'll have to give it a read.

44:47.883 --> 44:50.466
I think you might...
might recognize yourself.

44:50.566 --> 44:51.788
Oh, yeah?

44:51.888 --> 44:52.709
Mm-hm.

44:52.809 --> 44:53.870
I can't take a look now?

44:53.970 --> 44:54.911
No, not a chance, Sergeant.

44:55.011 --> 44:56.032
Aw...

44:56.132 --> 44:58.635
I knew you were
gonna say that.

44:58.735 --> 44:59.676
Well, if it's bad,

44:59.776 --> 45:01.238
I expect a full refund,
all right?

45:01.338 --> 45:02.479
No.

45:02.579 --> 45:05.102
Goldman... Goldman
doesn't offer refunds.

45:06.704 --> 45:08.005
I like what you did
with the house, man.

45:08.105 --> 45:08.806
It came out good.

45:08.906 --> 45:09.687
Yeah.

45:09.787 --> 45:10.728
Yeah.

45:10.828 --> 45:11.849
Interesting idea, too,

45:11.949 --> 45:13.691
making it a retreat
for writers.

45:13.791 --> 45:14.612
Yeah.

45:14.712 --> 45:16.014
Yeah, you know, I mean...

45:16.114 --> 45:18.536
maybe I can help them
believe in themselves.

45:18.636 --> 45:20.459
You know, like, um...

45:20.559 --> 45:23.682

do for himself.

45:25.364 --> 45:26.425
Hey, uh...

45:26.525 --> 45:29.448

No.

45:30.049 --> 45:33.353

46:02.964 --> 46:04.907
Look, they both wrote
masterpieces, right?

46:05.007 --> 46:05.988
At least this way,

46:06.088 --> 46:07.069
Luther gets
the credit he deserves,

okay, Sergeant?

46:11.774 --> 46:12.675
Right.

46:12.775 --> 46:14.157
All right.

46:14.257 --> 46:15.278
Do you mind if I keep this?

46:15.378 --> 46:17.600
You are too much.

You know, if Harry

46:18.701 --> 46:19.382
could have
taken his own advice,

46:19.462 --> 46:20.804
trusted
what he wrote,

46:20.904 --> 46:22.806
none of this
would have happened.

46:22.906 --> 46:23.887
Watch your step.

The guy owes you, again.

So, what are you
gonna do now, writer?

inspiration to strike,
