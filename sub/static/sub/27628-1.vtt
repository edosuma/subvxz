00:15.064 --> 00:17.000
What are we going to do, Len...?

00:17.000 --> 00:19.084
Don't know, Daryl, I haven't had
much time to figure it out yet,
have you?

00:19.084 --> 00:21.024
Well, they're not having my room.

00:21.024 --> 00:23.052
Well, where am I supposed
to put them, in the...

00:23.052 --> 00:24.080
BOTH: Cellar!

00:25.080 --> 00:28.096
Right, Princess, out! Your carriage
awaits. Never!

00:28.096 --> 00:32.008
Come here, now. Round here, move it.

00:34.020 --> 00:36.088
The nearest living soul is ten miles
away

00:36.088 --> 00:39.036
so don't waste your breath
screaming.

00:39.036 --> 00:42.004
Do as you're told and you
won't get hurt.

00:46.036 --> 00:48.004
Oh, my!

01:17.092 --> 01:20.012
I never actually said "whodunnit".

01:20.012 --> 01:23.012
No, you just blurted out their
name in the interval.

01:23.012 --> 01:24.076
It was a lucky guess.

01:24.076 --> 01:27.096
Rather a good one, though,
don't you think?I do not think.

01:27.096 --> 01:31.084
The ending was no surprise at all.
This is intolerable.

01:31.084 --> 01:35.004
I say... Yes, Madam...all the first
class compartments are full.

01:35.004 --> 01:37.064
Yes, he can see that with
his own eyes.

01:37.064 --> 01:40.088
Well, I'm sure there's
something he could do.

01:50.036 --> 01:52.092
If you hadn't insisted on going
round to the stage door.

01:52.092 --> 01:55.068
And if you hadn't ruined the ending.

01:55.068 --> 01:59.064
Getting my programme signed was a
very small consolation.

01:59.064 --> 02:05.036
And in any case it won't kill you to
slum it for once in your life.

02:07.096 --> 02:13.024
Do my eyes deceive me?
Felicia Montague?

02:13.024 --> 02:14.032
Bianca Norman?

02:14.032 --> 02:17.060
What on Earth are you doing in
here?

02:17.060 --> 02:21.012
We were late for the train and
first class was full.

02:21.012 --> 02:23.036
Salvation is here.

02:23.036 --> 02:24.084
My Pullman's on the back.

02:24.084 --> 02:27.040
I never travel without it.

02:27.040 --> 02:29.044
And your companion?

02:29.044 --> 02:31.020
I am perfectly happy here.

02:31.020 --> 02:33.080
Do you remember my daughter,
Barbara?

02:33.080 --> 02:35.000
Yes, Of course.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.032
Don't worry. She hardly makes much
effort to stand out.

02:40.060 --> 02:42.008
CLEARS THROAT

02:42.008 --> 02:43.024
Come along, Mrs M.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.088
My son Tony, husband Piers.

02:59.088 --> 03:03.084
I think we met at La Teatro
Venezia in '46.

03:03.084 --> 03:06.080
Alas, you confuse me with one of
my predecessors.

03:06.080 --> 03:08.004
Oh.

03:08.004 --> 03:10.096
That was Rudolf, my number four.

03:10.096 --> 03:15.040
Tony, fix us a drink. And we'll
have some music.

03:15.040 --> 03:17.060
I hope you like opera.

03:17.060 --> 03:18.088
Adore it.

03:18.088 --> 03:22.068
I'm very partial to a little bit of
Gilbert and Sullivan.

03:24.020 --> 03:26.072
My Stabat Mater by Rossini...

03:27.088 --> 03:30.048
..at La Scala in 1950.

03:31.056 --> 03:32.096
Gin and it.

03:32.096 --> 03:35.032
Oh! Divine.

03:35.032 --> 03:38.052
Admit it, Mrs M. This is more like
it.

03:38.052 --> 03:41.064
This is going to be a very
long evening. Mm-hm.

04:03.044 --> 04:04.088
No, thank you.

04:12.016 --> 04:13.020
Why are we stopping?

04:14.060 --> 04:16.076
We can't be here already.

04:16.076 --> 04:19.000
We've only just passed through
Hambleston.

04:20.076 --> 04:22.024
There's a red signal.

04:23.084 --> 04:26.040
I hope we won't be here for long.

04:26.040 --> 04:29.088
Oh! You're adopting again?

04:29.088 --> 04:31.096
When the papers are finalised.

04:31.096 --> 04:36.044
I wanted to give another child what
I gave Barbara and Tony.

04:36.044 --> 04:39.004
You both have been very fortunate.

04:39.004 --> 04:41.092
I miss the sound of children
laughing.

04:41.092 --> 04:43.076
Barbara's as quiet as a mouse now,

04:43.076 --> 04:46.040
and she used to be such a
happy little thing.

05:02.088 --> 05:05.008
Huh. Here we go.

05:08.044 --> 05:09.088
CLATTERING SOUND

05:25.060 --> 05:26.072
SHOUTING IN DISTANCE

05:26.072 --> 05:28.052
What's that?Don't move!

05:28.052 --> 05:30.044
The jewels, where are the jewels?

05:30.044 --> 05:31.084
GUNSHOT

05:31.084 --> 05:33.044
SECOND GUNSHOT

05:35.036 --> 05:37.012
LOUDEST GUNSHOT AND SCREAMS

05:47.096 --> 05:49.068
Oi!

05:49.068 --> 05:52.008
Oh, we'd stopped for quite
some time,

05:52.008 --> 05:56.020
then there was a judder and a jolt
and, then, the rest of the train

05:56.020 --> 05:59.008
pulled away without us and that's
when it happened.

05:59.008 --> 06:00.020
Keep your heads down...!

06:00.020 --> 06:03.080
Two men burst in and they demanded,
"The jewels! Where are the jewels?".

06:03.080 --> 06:05.064
Here. Just take them.

06:05.064 --> 06:08.076
So they grabbed the jewels and then
shot out the lights.

06:10.028 --> 06:12.072
Someone lit a match but it went
straight out and, then, BANG!

06:12.072 --> 06:15.016
Another shot.I'll get the lights!

06:15.016 --> 06:17.036
Then the lights came back on and...

06:17.036 --> 06:19.092
..that's when we saw what had
transpired.

06:22.008 --> 06:25.000
Huh!Ahh-h-h-h!

06:26.056 --> 06:29.080
Who knew Dame Bianca was
travelling with her jewels?

06:29.080 --> 06:33.088
Apart from 50 thousand readers of
"Stars of Stage and Screen"

06:33.088 --> 06:37.000
where she helpfully gave full
details of her itinerary.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.064
And what did they want with
my Aunt and Mrs M?

06:39.064 --> 06:42.012
Army Officers on the train
heard the gunfire

06:42.012 --> 06:45.000
and pulled the communication
cord.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.016
The robbers panicked. Grabbed the
nearest persons to use

06:48.016 --> 06:50.060
as human shields while they made
their getaway.

06:50.060 --> 06:51.084
GUNSHOTS

06:51.084 --> 06:54.064
They're shooting at us. Quick!
Go, go, go, go!

06:58.080 --> 07:02.032
I'll get them back safe and sound.
You have my word.

07:02.032 --> 07:04.060
God knows they must be terrified.

07:06.012 --> 07:07.016
Sir...

07:14.084 --> 07:16.088
Another fine mess you've
got me in to!

07:17.092 --> 07:21.036
Me? That's rich coming from you.

07:21.036 --> 07:24.004
I was perfectly happy in second
class!

07:24.004 --> 07:27.000
Well, I was perfectly happy to leave
straight after the performance.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.048
Shut your squawking!

07:36.036 --> 07:40.008
If only you weren't such an
autograph hunter!

07:40.008 --> 07:42.052
If only you weren't too hoity toity

07:42.052 --> 07:45.060
to mix with ordinary, common,
decent folk.

07:46.084 --> 07:48.060
Hoity toity?!

07:58.012 --> 08:01.068
Rest assured that all available man
power is being deployed in

08:01.068 --> 08:05.004
the hunt for The Countess and
Mrs McCarthy.

08:05.004 --> 08:07.028
Inspector Mallory, any clues who
the robbers might be?

08:07.028 --> 08:09.020
We're narrowing the search and
confident

08:09.020 --> 08:11.092
that it's just a matter
of time before they are apprehended.

08:11.092 --> 08:16.024
When, rest assured, they will feel
the full weight of the law.

08:16.024 --> 08:18.032
Inspector Mallory?
Inspector Mallory?

08:18.032 --> 08:19.036
Inspector Mallory?

08:26.092 --> 08:28.072
Can you see anything?

08:30.032 --> 08:32.056
It looks like a farm.

08:32.056 --> 08:34.028
I meant anything useful.

08:36.011 --> 08:39.059
Well, there isn't a bus stop and a
telephone box next to it

08:39.059 --> 08:41.032
if that's what you're hoping for.

08:44.052 --> 08:46.028
There's someone coming!

09:06.068 --> 09:07.084
What is that?

09:09.012 --> 09:10.056
Porridge.

09:10.056 --> 09:12.060
I hardly think so.

09:12.060 --> 09:14.012
You'll eat it, or else.

09:14.012 --> 09:17.080
"Or else" what? We're hardly any use
to you dead.

09:17.080 --> 09:21.012
We'll die of starvation if this is
what they're going to feed us.

09:21.012 --> 09:23.080
Some toast and marmalade
will suffice.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.012
I've got jam.

09:34.008 --> 09:36.016
Father Brown and Miss Windermere,
sir.

09:36.016 --> 09:37.040
Show them in.

09:39.044 --> 09:41.036
I've been expecting you.

09:41.036 --> 09:42.068
Please.

09:48.004 --> 09:51.068
You're here to enquire about
my progress.

09:51.068 --> 09:52.072
Getaway vehicle.

09:52.072 --> 09:55.052
Over 100 Fordson vans registered in
the area

09:55.052 --> 09:58.020
so they'll take some time to follow
up. Wha...

09:58.020 --> 10:00.048
Knowledge of the signals suggests
insider knowledge

10:00.048 --> 10:04.060
so the Railway are providing names
of sacked or disgruntled employees.

10:04.060 --> 10:07.036
Ditto, Dame Bianca's staff.

10:07.036 --> 10:09.088
We're checking for ex convicts
in the locale

10:09.088 --> 10:11.068
with convictions
for robbery.

10:11.068 --> 10:16.000
20 mile road blocks and an
All Ports Alert.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.016
So, if you think there is
anything I've missed?

10:21.032 --> 10:23.080
You've been very thorough,
Inspector.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.084
A rare complement from you, Padre.

10:25.084 --> 10:28.020
Now, I know you're dying to
interfere.

10:28.020 --> 10:29.088
But on this occasion all that's
required

10:29.088 --> 10:32.044
is good old-fashioned
police work.

10:32.044 --> 10:35.056
If you want to help, maybe you
could offer spiritual solace

10:35.056 --> 10:38.012
to the family - which has
the advantage of keeping them

10:38.012 --> 10:39.044
out of my hair.

10:39.044 --> 10:41.012
Now...

10:41.012 --> 10:43.004
..if you'll excuse me.

10:43.004 --> 10:45.004
Thank you.

10:45.004 --> 10:46.068
A word please, Sergeant.

10:50.088 --> 10:52.060
Shut the door behind you.

10:53.084 --> 10:56.044
I've got press and rubberneckers
descending in droves.

10:56.044 --> 10:59.020
I want no repetition of this.

10:59.020 --> 11:01.012
Crime scene under 24 hour guard.

11:01.012 --> 11:04.056
No-one enters. And you might want
to write this down.

11:04.056 --> 11:06.056
Keep the Padre out of my sight.

11:06.056 --> 11:09.052
Any funny business and you deal with
it under pain of death.

11:09.052 --> 11:12.000
Yours, that is.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.016
Sir.

11:16.012 --> 11:19.044
Your turn. They're doing my head in.

11:21.060 --> 11:24.092
No, no, no! No-one would get hurt,
they said.

11:24.092 --> 11:26.048
It was an accident.

11:26.048 --> 11:29.056
You were only supposed to shoot the
lights out! Wha? It wasn't me.

11:29.056 --> 11:33.036
Well, it weren't me. I never fired
my gun.Two shots is all I fired.

11:33.036 --> 11:35.052
At the lights. I think I can count
to two.

11:35.052 --> 11:38.052
And I can count to none.
I wouldn't lay bets on it!

11:38.052 --> 11:40.084
Are you calling me a liar?
I'm calling you an idiot.

11:40.084 --> 11:44.036
Rude!Excuse me!

11:44.036 --> 11:46.084
There is, of course,
a simple way of resolving this.

11:49.012 --> 11:51.032
It's hard to believe she's gone.

11:52.048 --> 11:55.004
She was always so much
larger than life.

11:55.004 --> 11:57.060
She is still larger than life.

11:57.060 --> 11:59.024
Her legacy will live on.

12:00.044 --> 12:02.072
Her voice recorded for eternity.

12:05.040 --> 12:06.060
Poor Lucy.

12:07.072 --> 12:09.076
To lose not one mother but two.

12:10.088 --> 12:13.016
Will you be going ahead with
the adoption?

12:13.016 --> 12:14.020
No! Good God!

12:15.044 --> 12:17.048
My name wasn't on the papers.

12:17.048 --> 12:21.008
She considered fathers
extraneous to requirement.

12:21.008 --> 12:23.088
Her husbands never lasted long
enough to play the part.

12:26.088 --> 12:29.036
And what will you do, Miss Norman?

12:29.036 --> 12:32.000
I hadn't thought about it.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.048
I think I'm rather too old to
reinvent myself.

12:34.048 --> 12:35.096
Tony's not.

12:35.096 --> 12:38.048
You could go back to the boards.

12:38.048 --> 12:40.048
You're an actor?

12:40.048 --> 12:43.048
As your question infers,
an unsuccessful one.

12:43.048 --> 12:45.040
Actually, he was rather good.

12:45.040 --> 12:46.080
Too good for Bianca.

12:48.024 --> 12:51.036
But she decided there wasn't room
for two stars in her firmament,

12:51.036 --> 12:52.080
and poof...

12:52.080 --> 12:56.016
..the parts mysteriously dried up.

12:56.016 --> 12:57.028
That's enough, Piers.

12:59.088 --> 13:03.012
Is there any news of Lady Felicia
and Mrs McCarthy?

13:03.012 --> 13:06.072
The police are doing
everything they can.

13:06.072 --> 13:10.004
In the meantime we can
only wait and pray.

13:15.020 --> 13:18.060
What did I tell you?
Two spent cartridges.

13:18.060 --> 13:21.096
What did I tell you? Six bullets.

13:21.096 --> 13:24.000
Well, that settles that then.

13:25.092 --> 13:28.048
There was another shooter.

13:28.048 --> 13:30.016
Who are "they?"

13:30.016 --> 13:35.064
This morning I heard you say
"no-one would get hurt, THEY said."

13:35.064 --> 13:37.080
Them's who's paid us to rob train.
Enough.

13:37.080 --> 13:39.060
Like we can get in more trouble.

13:39.060 --> 13:41.016
Who are these people?

13:43.036 --> 13:45.012
We never saw 'em.

13:45.012 --> 13:47.080
They sent the guns and instructions.

13:47.080 --> 13:51.004
All we had to do was shoot out
the lights and nab the jewels.

13:51.004 --> 13:54.020
Maybe they were there? It was dark.

13:54.020 --> 13:56.048
I said I couldn't see properly
through them stockings.

13:56.048 --> 13:58.088
You should have worn 10 denier.
Will you "shh"!

14:00.056 --> 14:03.008
I have to think.

14:03.008 --> 14:04.096
They'll catch us...

14:04.096 --> 14:08.008
..and they'll hang us, Len.
There, now.

14:08.008 --> 14:11.004
No use crying over
spilt milk.

14:11.004 --> 14:14.076
What you need to do is find a way to
prove your innocence.

14:15.092 --> 14:18.012
And how do you suggest we do that?

14:25.032 --> 14:26.084
KNOCKS AT DOOR

14:31.096 --> 14:34.076
Miss Windermere, this was
left on the altar.

14:34.076 --> 14:36.024
Any news?

14:36.024 --> 14:37.040
No, no news.

14:37.040 --> 14:38.084
You will let us know won't you...

14:38.084 --> 14:40.088
We will of course.
Thank you. Goodbye.

14:40.088 --> 14:42.044
Thank you, Mrs Ferris.

14:48.008 --> 14:50.064
The cleaning ladies found
this on the altar.

14:50.064 --> 14:51.096
Thank you.

14:58.028 --> 14:59.080
What is it?

15:02.020 --> 15:05.032
Hostages begins with an H,
not an O.

15:06.052 --> 15:07.088
As for the grammar...!

15:07.088 --> 15:10.052
Perhaps you could sound
more threatening.

15:10.052 --> 15:14.084
"Or else", if you don't mind
my saying, sounds a bit woolly.

15:14.084 --> 15:17.048
And wouldn't Father Brown
demand some sort of proof?

15:17.048 --> 15:19.020
I ain't cutting no fingers off!

15:19.020 --> 15:21.028
I wish we could cut
their tongues out.

15:21.028 --> 15:24.048
Really! If you can't take
any constructive criticism...

15:24.048 --> 15:26.024
You think you can do a better job?

15:31.044 --> 15:37.008
Prove...our...innocence...

15:38.076 --> 15:40.076
Two Ns in innocence.

15:40.076 --> 15:42.012
If...

15:42.012 --> 15:44.028
READS: You want your friends
back alive,

15:44.028 --> 15:46.012
don't go to the police.

15:46.012 --> 15:47.096
Is it genuine?

15:49.000 --> 15:52.016
READS:PS. Don't forget to water
the aspidistras,

15:52.016 --> 15:54.016
and the fiscal accounts
are due Friday.

15:56.088 --> 15:58.040
SQUEALING

15:58.040 --> 16:00.028
Kitty! Go on!

16:00.028 --> 16:03.020
Gertrude, get in it or you'll have
it torn! Get over there!

16:03.020 --> 16:07.036
They're loading animals into a van.

16:07.036 --> 16:09.036
Oh, my finger! You dirty pig!

16:09.036 --> 16:10.080
What kind of animals?

16:12.020 --> 16:15.048
Is the breed really relevant?

16:15.048 --> 16:17.084
If you must know, pigs.

16:17.084 --> 16:20.076
Today is the second Tuesday
of the month.

16:20.076 --> 16:25.028
From which I deduce they're off
to the swine sale in Hambleston.

16:25.028 --> 16:26.072
SQUEALING

16:26.072 --> 16:30.076
Quite the detective, Mrs M.

16:30.076 --> 16:37.004
Which gives us long enough
to make...our escape.

16:37.004 --> 16:39.084
It has obviously escaped
your attention

16:39.084 --> 16:42.056
that we are chained up like dogs.

16:42.056 --> 16:44.092
Oh, yet another graduate

16:44.092 --> 16:48.084
of the Sidney Carter
College of Breaking and Entering.

16:50.020 --> 16:52.088
Although why a Countess
feels the need

16:52.088 --> 16:55.036
to add lock-picking
to her accomplishments, I...

16:58.052 --> 17:00.004
Ta-da!

17:30.016 --> 17:31.068
HE SCREAMS

17:31.068 --> 17:34.036
Sh!We're in the middle of nowhere!

17:34.036 --> 17:36.016
Now what?

17:36.016 --> 17:39.004
We go inside, find a telephone
and call the police.

17:39.004 --> 17:41.036
Right.

17:45.036 --> 17:47.020
Hello?

17:50.020 --> 17:52.048
Holy Mother!Are you all right?!

17:52.048 --> 17:56.024
Perfectly. I often have a nap
under a table at this time of day.

17:56.024 --> 17:58.012
More to the point, who are you?

17:58.012 --> 17:59.064
Oh! We're, um...

17:59.064 --> 18:01.044
Our car broke down.
It's a long story.

18:01.044 --> 18:03.028
I wonder, do you have a telephone?

18:03.028 --> 18:05.076
In the hall.Righto.
First things first.

18:05.076 --> 18:07.064
Let's set you to rights.Yes.

18:13.056 --> 18:15.032
You've got five minutes, Father.

18:15.032 --> 18:16.068
You're a brick, Sergeant.

18:18.052 --> 18:20.004
Anything interesting, Father?

18:20.004 --> 18:23.040
A letter, from Dame Bianca Norman's
solicitors.

18:24.068 --> 18:28.072
It seems she was planning to divest
herself of husband number five.

18:29.092 --> 18:31.048
Anyone could have found this.

18:31.048 --> 18:33.024
That can't be right.

18:43.080 --> 18:45.056
Mallory? 4:00.

18:56.040 --> 18:58.016
All quiet in Dodge?

18:58.016 --> 19:00.004
Dodge, sir?

19:00.004 --> 19:01.084
Anything to report, Sergeant?

19:01.084 --> 19:04.084
Oh, right. Most of the sightseers
got bored and wandered off

19:04.084 --> 19:07.036
and the press seem to have given up.

19:07.036 --> 19:10.040
I wouldn't say given up, merely
decamped to the police station,

19:10.040 --> 19:12.096
awaiting news of our investigation.

19:12.096 --> 19:14.088
And how's that going, sir?

19:14.088 --> 19:17.080
Turns out Bianca Norman was patron
for a welfare charity

19:17.080 --> 19:19.080
for ex-convicts.

19:19.080 --> 19:23.076
I'm having the files sent over
to see if they throw up any matches.

19:27.016 --> 19:29.064
Ah, hello. Police, plea...

19:29.064 --> 19:31.028
Police... Hello?

19:32.052 --> 19:34.008
Hello?

19:36.040 --> 19:38.008
Hello?!

19:38.008 --> 19:39.072
So, who lives here?

19:39.072 --> 19:42.076
Me and my brothers. Ow!

19:42.076 --> 19:45.092
Yes, well, you don't want it going
septic, now, do you?

19:45.092 --> 19:48.096
Especially with hygiene standards
around here

19:48.096 --> 19:50.092
leaving much to be desired.

19:50.092 --> 19:53.028
Where was it you said
you broke down, again?

19:53.028 --> 19:56.032
Oh, a couple of miles from here.

19:56.032 --> 19:59.068
It's just, we're pretty remote,
and there aren't many places

19:59.068 --> 20:01.084
that require evening dress
in the middle of the day.

20:01.084 --> 20:05.060
Yes. Well, don't you worry
your head about that.

20:05.060 --> 20:09.044
Now, I am going to make us
a nice hot cup of tea.

20:09.044 --> 20:11.084
No-one is going anywhere!

20:11.084 --> 20:14.024
Swine sale in Hambleston!

20:14.024 --> 20:15.072
Out!

20:15.072 --> 20:19.052
I am going nowhere until I have
a hot cup of tea inside of me.

20:19.052 --> 20:21.040
You'll do as you're told.

20:21.040 --> 20:23.000
Or what?

20:23.000 --> 20:26.080
Oh, he'll poke us to death?

20:26.080 --> 20:28.024
Well, at least it might shut you up.

20:28.024 --> 20:30.096
WHISPERS:Len? Len!

20:30.096 --> 20:32.048
What?!

20:37.064 --> 20:39.064
Are these what you're looking for?

20:43.044 --> 20:46.024
Now, would someone like to tell me
what's going on?

20:48.080 --> 20:50.040
I thought Inspector Mallory...

20:50.040 --> 20:52.012
Is busy, I'm afraid.

20:52.012 --> 20:55.060
Er...we'd, er...
The Father would, er...

20:55.060 --> 20:58.052
Like your aid
in a crime reconstruction.

20:58.052 --> 21:00.068
For what possible reason?

21:00.068 --> 21:02.084
Well, I hope that will become clear.

21:02.084 --> 21:05.048
Now, if you wouldn't mind,
please all take your positions

21:05.048 --> 21:07.072
as you were on the night.

21:11.068 --> 21:15.004
The sergeant and I will play
the parts of Lady Felicia

21:15.004 --> 21:17.000
and Mrs McCarthy.

21:20.064 --> 21:23.024
And Miss Bunty Windermere,
our resident ballistics expert,

21:23.024 --> 21:25.044
will play the part of the robbers.

21:27.028 --> 21:29.052
Miss Windermere will play
the robbers!

21:31.088 --> 21:33.052
I improvised.

21:33.052 --> 21:36.092
They burst in! They shot
the lights out! Bang! Bang!

21:36.092 --> 21:38.044
Then darkness.

21:38.044 --> 21:41.096
Bang!
The bullet goes through the chair,

21:41.096 --> 21:44.036
through the curtain and then
straight through the window.

21:44.036 --> 21:47.024
But the trajectory is wrong.

21:47.024 --> 21:50.004
From this height, the bullet would
have embedded itself

21:50.004 --> 21:51.080
lower in the wall.

21:53.004 --> 21:55.040
Meaning the killer was seated.

21:55.040 --> 21:58.052
I literally have no idea
what you're talking about.

21:58.052 --> 22:00.084
He's not the only one, Sergeant!

22:00.084 --> 22:04.012
New evidence suggests
a third shooter, sir.

22:04.012 --> 22:06.012
Does he now?

22:06.012 --> 22:10.028
It might have been thrown from
the window, so I ordered a search.

22:10.028 --> 22:12.056
On whose authority?

22:12.056 --> 22:14.024
WHISTLE!

22:14.024 --> 22:17.008
It's a gun, Sergeant.
There's a nice set of prints.

22:18.012 --> 22:19.096
I expect we should take
fingerprints, sir.

22:19.096 --> 22:22.080
I'll save you the bother.
They're mine.

22:22.080 --> 22:25.048
No, Barb, don't!Say nothing, Tony.

22:25.048 --> 22:28.068
It's nothing you understand.
Just call our solicitor.

22:28.068 --> 22:32.044
Barbara Norman, I'm arresting you
for the murder of Bianca Norman.

22:32.044 --> 22:34.096
You are not obliged to say anything
unless you wish to do so,

22:34.096 --> 22:37.048
but whatever you say may be taken
down and given in evidence.

22:43.056 --> 22:47.064
To summarise, a person or persons
unknown solicited you

22:47.064 --> 22:49.084
to a hold up a train and rob
a world-famous diva.

22:49.084 --> 22:53.096
During the execution of which,
you failed to rob said jewels.

22:53.096 --> 22:56.060
The diva was shot and you acquired
two hostages.

22:56.060 --> 22:59.032
One of whom is
a Countess of the Realm.

22:59.032 --> 23:02.032
Thus leaving you
Britain's most wanted.

23:04.036 --> 23:05.096
What were you thinking?!

23:07.076 --> 23:09.096
Don't tell me
this is what I think it is?

23:11.028 --> 23:13.072
Well, thank you for at least
consulting me before going out

23:13.072 --> 23:16.028
and committing armed robbery
and kidnap on my behalf!

23:16.028 --> 23:18.028
He wants to be a barrister.

23:18.028 --> 23:20.092
And you want to be captain of
Aston Villa.

23:20.092 --> 23:22.076
I hate to be the one to break it
to you, but...

23:22.076 --> 23:24.068
The difference is,
he's got two left feet.

23:24.068 --> 23:26.096
The only thing stopping you is cash.

23:26.096 --> 23:29.012
Scholarship to the grammar school.

23:29.012 --> 23:32.040
Highest school certificate
in the county.

23:32.040 --> 23:35.000
His teachers said he was a natural
for the law.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.080
Except things as that
aren't for the likes of us.

23:37.080 --> 23:39.064
Well, I suppose that's
all right, then,

23:39.064 --> 23:41.052
you getting us into this unholy mess

23:41.052 --> 23:43.076
to provide little old me
with an education.

23:43.076 --> 23:45.028
To get you a life.

23:45.028 --> 23:47.044
You want to spend it here,

23:47.044 --> 23:50.068
stuck in that chair with loads of
books you'll never use?

23:50.068 --> 23:53.048
And if something happens to us,
what then?

23:53.048 --> 23:56.048
They cart you off to spend the rest
of it in an institution?!

23:56.048 --> 23:59.096
A prospect becoming
evermore imminent by the second.

23:59.096 --> 24:01.076
And as for your hostages,

24:01.076 --> 24:04.000
they've seen your faces now.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.024
I suppose you're just going to have
to shoot them.

24:06.024 --> 24:08.036
That's quite enough of your lip!

24:09.052 --> 24:13.076
They're the only insurance we've
got. They're staying in here!

24:13.076 --> 24:15.084
Back to the cellar with you!

24:15.084 --> 24:18.092
Why?
We're in the middle of nowhere here.

24:18.092 --> 24:21.056
You can hardly expect us to make
a dash for freedom in these gowns.

24:21.056 --> 24:25.020
And you have cows that need milking!

24:25.020 --> 24:26.060
I suggest you tend them

24:26.060 --> 24:32.092
while I rustle up something
that is at least edible.

24:32.092 --> 24:35.000
She really is the most
marvellous cook.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.044
Motion sustained!

24:37.044 --> 24:40.000
HE SIGHS

24:45.056 --> 24:47.024
Why didn't you bring this to me?!

24:47.024 --> 24:49.072
The bit which says,
"Do not go to the police".

24:49.072 --> 24:51.028
Give me one good reason

24:51.028 --> 24:55.044
why I shouldn't discipline you
for gross insubordination!

24:55.044 --> 24:57.064
I was following instructions, sir.

24:59.052 --> 25:01.036
READS:Keep the Padre
out of my sight.

25:01.036 --> 25:04.044
Any funny business and you deal
with it under pain of death.

25:04.044 --> 25:05.068
Yours, that is.

25:07.008 --> 25:10.056
Let's just say that the end
justifies the means.

25:10.056 --> 25:12.092
Let's see what she's got to say
for herself first.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.084
No traipsing mud through the house!

25:30.028 --> 25:31.076
Well, sit yourselves down.

25:39.084 --> 25:41.052
Ah-ah!

25:46.048 --> 25:49.020
Bless us, oh Lord, and these thy
gifts which we are about to receive

25:49.020 --> 25:51.044
through Christ our Lord. Amen.
Amen.Amen.Mm-hm.

25:54.092 --> 25:57.096
So I've been looking into
your predicament and from what
I can gather,

25:57.096 --> 26:00.008
the only real offences
you've committed

26:00.008 --> 26:02.088
are attempted armed robbery
and kidnap.

26:02.088 --> 26:05.076
Hand yourselves in and give back
the hostages,

26:05.076 --> 26:08.020
mitigating circumstances,
and a good barrister,

26:08.020 --> 26:11.012
you could be looking at
as little as five years.

26:11.012 --> 26:13.064
Before or after they hang us
for murder?

26:15.052 --> 26:17.064
You said the priest
would find out who did it!

26:17.064 --> 26:19.008
And so he will.

26:19.008 --> 26:21.060
RADIO:This is the BBC.
Here is the news.

26:21.060 --> 26:23.000
TELEPHONE PIPS

26:28.028 --> 26:30.084
A huge manhunt continues
for armed robbers

26:30.084 --> 26:34.044
who murdered world-renowned
opera singer Dame Bianca Norman

26:34.044 --> 26:37.032
and kidnapped the Countess
of Montague and her companion.

26:37.032 --> 26:39.064
Detective Inspector Mallory
of Kembleford Police

26:39.064 --> 26:41.080
made this statement earlier.

26:41.080 --> 26:46.012
We're narrowing the search
and confident it's just a matter
of time before they are apprehended.

26:46.012 --> 26:50.040
When, rest assured, they will feel
the full weight of the law.

26:50.040 --> 26:52.032
The Earl of Montague
has offered a reward

26:52.032 --> 26:55.092
for information leading to
the safe return of his wife.Sweet!

26:55.092 --> 26:57.056
The Prime Minister Winston Churchill

26:57.056 --> 26:59.064
gave a speech in
the House of Commons yesterday,

26:59.064 --> 27:01.028
opposing the proposed...

27:01.028 --> 27:03.092
Companion! I do have a name!

27:03.092 --> 27:06.088
Maybe they just forgot. There's
no need to take it personally.

27:06.088 --> 27:09.092
How would you like it if they
forgot to mention your name?

27:09.092 --> 27:11.076
Well, perhaps they didn't think
it was as...

27:12.080 --> 27:14.092
Maybe they didn't think it was as...

27:14.092 --> 27:17.048
Relevant? Newsworthy?Yes.

27:17.048 --> 27:21.076
No. Must you always be
so oversensitive?!

27:21.076 --> 27:25.076
And this from the woman unable
to park her posh posterior

27:25.076 --> 27:28.016
in a second-class train compartment!

27:28.016 --> 27:30.092
My apologies for whisking you off
into the lap of luxury!

27:30.092 --> 27:33.080
Into armed robbery and murder!

27:35.016 --> 27:37.004
Grub's good.

27:40.068 --> 27:42.012
It was pitch-black.

27:43.016 --> 27:44.060
Everyone was shouting.

27:46.052 --> 27:48.000
Then Tony lit a match.

27:49.048 --> 27:52.080
It was only a few seconds, but I saw
that his coat was over the chair

27:52.080 --> 27:54.072
and I knew there was a gun
in the pocket.

27:54.072 --> 27:58.004
Why was your brother
carrying a firearm?

27:58.004 --> 28:00.076
For exactly the eventuality
that transpired.

28:02.080 --> 28:04.088
My mother refused to travel
with security.

28:06.004 --> 28:09.036
It wouldn't occur to her
that someone so revered would be
attacked.

28:09.036 --> 28:11.080
So, you took the gun from the coat?

28:13.028 --> 28:14.080
It was mayhem.

28:16.020 --> 28:17.092
Panicking and shouting.

28:20.064 --> 28:25.080
And as I pulled it out,
it went off by accident.

28:27.020 --> 28:28.088
I didn't...

28:30.068 --> 28:33.056
It was only when the lights went on
that I saw that she...

28:33.056 --> 28:36.072
And yet you said nothing.

28:36.072 --> 28:38.064
I was in shock!

28:40.008 --> 28:42.060
Everyone assumed it was the robbers.

28:45.032 --> 28:48.096
The longer I kept silent, the harder
it was to admit the truth.

28:52.048 --> 28:54.036
That I killed my own mother!

29:03.096 --> 29:06.060
Do you know what will happen to me,
Inspector?

29:14.080 --> 29:19.000
It seems it was nothing more than
a tragic accident.

29:19.000 --> 29:23.024
She'll be released from police
custody while enquiries continue.

29:23.024 --> 29:24.084
Poor soul.

29:24.084 --> 29:27.000
Imagine killing your own mother.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.056
Frequently.

29:29.092 --> 29:31.060
This will make the morning papers.

29:31.060 --> 29:34.096
Your faith in the villain's code
would be touching

29:34.096 --> 29:37.004
if not so misguided.

29:37.004 --> 29:39.004
Which means it's down to me.

29:39.004 --> 29:41.052
They're in here somewhere,

29:41.052 --> 29:43.096
and I won't rest till I find them.

29:43.096 --> 29:45.048
Thank you.

29:53.096 --> 29:55.076
BIRDSONG

30:02.024 --> 30:03.092
Cudlip.

30:09.068 --> 30:11.056
Cudlip.

30:16.028 --> 30:18.076
Cudlip. Gotcha!

30:18.076 --> 30:22.084
Morning, sir.Sergeant,
get me HQ on the blower.

30:28.092 --> 30:30.016
Leonard Cudlip.

30:30.016 --> 30:32.068
Former track engineer sentenced
to two years -

30:32.068 --> 30:35.012
involvement with robbery on a train.

30:35.012 --> 30:38.088
Recently sent a begging letter to
Dame Bianca's ex-convicts' charity,

30:38.088 --> 30:40.088
which was rejected.

30:40.088 --> 30:45.024
And brother Daryl is the registered
owner of a green Fordson van.

30:47.020 --> 30:48.072
Permission to draw weapons, sir?

30:50.012 --> 30:52.032
Yes, sir, we will.

30:53.044 --> 30:55.008
I take it you've found
the kidnappers?

30:55.008 --> 30:59.060
You can take it to mean I have
no time for unwanted visitors.

30:59.060 --> 31:01.000
Round up all available men,

31:01.000 --> 31:03.088
and I want maps of Deepwell Farm
and the surrounding area.

31:03.088 --> 31:07.052
Right you are, sir.
For the sake of our beloved friends,

31:07.052 --> 31:09.084
I urge you not to go in
heavy-handed.

31:14.008 --> 31:16.032
WHISTLE!

31:43.064 --> 31:45.004
BELL RINGS

31:57.068 --> 31:59.040
MUSIC PLAYS

32:04.012 --> 32:05.096
Boots!Police!

32:07.048 --> 32:08.080
BELL RINGS

32:12.096 --> 32:15.008
Get down!
PANICKED SHOUTS

32:21.060 --> 32:23.076
Cuthbert, Clough,
search the outbuildings!

32:23.076 --> 32:25.088
The rest of you, stand by and await
my orders.

32:29.012 --> 32:30.072
This is no place for civilians!

32:30.072 --> 32:33.004
Well, if you're going to have
a shoot-out,

32:33.004 --> 32:35.012
a priest might come in handy.

32:35.012 --> 32:38.032
I could out-sniper the lot of you,
if you'd care to give me a firearm.

32:38.032 --> 32:39.088
No, I would not.

32:39.088 --> 32:42.076
Sir? Just found this.

32:45.020 --> 32:46.088
It's my aunt's!

32:48.020 --> 32:49.056
Right.

32:51.056 --> 32:55.088
You are surrounded by armed police,
with no means of escape!

32:55.088 --> 32:59.012
Release the women
and surrender yourselves!

32:59.012 --> 33:01.004
I advise you do as he says.

33:02.012 --> 33:04.048
If we surrender,
they'll hang us for murder.

33:04.048 --> 33:06.008
What, then?

33:06.008 --> 33:08.044
I'd rather go down fighting.

33:10.044 --> 33:12.084
What if we shot someone?

33:12.084 --> 33:14.040
It's not their fault, Len!

33:16.016 --> 33:18.000
You could take the bullets
out of the guns.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.044
That lot out there would never know
they were unloaded.

33:26.032 --> 33:28.008
At least a bullet will be quick.

33:29.004 --> 33:30.032
I'm frightened, Len!

33:32.012 --> 33:33.052
I don't want to die!

33:38.036 --> 33:41.020
So, Inspector, what's your plan?

33:41.020 --> 33:44.044
I'm going to make them wish
they'd never been born.

33:45.060 --> 33:47.064
It's a bit gung-ho, isn't it?

33:47.064 --> 33:50.036
Isn't it standard practice
to negotiate, sir?

33:51.040 --> 33:53.012
They don't know that.

33:55.060 --> 33:57.076
Get ready to fire on my command

33:57.076 --> 34:00.088
if they don't come out
in five minutes!

34:02.044 --> 34:04.020
Let's see if that flushes them out.

34:04.020 --> 34:07.012
They said they'd release the
hostages if we found the killer!

34:07.012 --> 34:09.012
And you believe them?

34:09.012 --> 34:11.063
Especially when they're caught,
like rats in a trap?

34:11.063 --> 34:13.024
Now, if you'd move aside...

34:13.024 --> 34:15.068
Padre? Padre? Come back here! Padre!

34:15.068 --> 34:17.020
Hello?

34:17.020 --> 34:19.004
My name's Father Brown.

34:19.004 --> 34:21.063
Oh, thank goodness!
The cavalry has arrived.

34:21.063 --> 34:23.040
I have something to show you.

34:28.096 --> 34:31.032
It's a trap!
They'll fire through the door!

34:31.032 --> 34:33.036
Don't worry,
they won't shoot a priest.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.060
I wouldn't count on it!

34:38.052 --> 34:41.056
READS:A 32-year-old female
has been released without charge.

34:41.056 --> 34:43.076
There! What did I tell you?

34:43.076 --> 34:46.052
With the murder charge dropped,
good behaviour,

34:46.052 --> 34:48.040
you could be out in five years.

34:48.040 --> 34:49.088
I can't go back inside.

34:49.088 --> 34:52.000
As for him, he wouldn't last
five minutes.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.072
Didn't he tell you?
It's not his first offence.

34:54.072 --> 34:56.096
Our parents were dead.

34:56.096 --> 34:58.084
The farm was going under.

34:58.084 --> 35:00.068
Somebody had to put food on table.

35:00.068 --> 35:02.056
With us gone, what'll happen to him?

35:02.056 --> 35:05.020
Wish you'd thought of that
before you went and robbed a train.

35:06.076 --> 35:08.064
I'm sorry.

35:09.072 --> 35:11.016
Me, too.

35:11.016 --> 35:13.052
It's the thought that counts, eh?

35:16.016 --> 35:17.080
Time's up!

35:17.080 --> 35:20.036
10 seconds, then we're coming in!

35:22.080 --> 35:24.080
Just a few more minutes.

35:24.080 --> 35:26.076
I've humoured you enough, Padre.

35:26.076 --> 35:30.004
Now, get out of the way before you
accidentally get shot!

35:30.004 --> 35:32.088
Five...four...

35:32.088 --> 35:34.080
three...two...

35:34.080 --> 35:37.036
Don't shoot!

35:37.036 --> 35:40.024
Hold your fire! Weapons down!

35:40.024 --> 35:42.040
Inspector, thank goodness!
We were so frightened!

35:42.040 --> 35:43.080
Oh, Aunt Fliss!

35:43.080 --> 35:47.020
It's good to see you safe, ladies,
but please move away from the house.

35:47.020 --> 35:49.044
This could get nasty.No! No!

35:49.044 --> 35:52.024
Those men in there,
they didn't kidnap us.

35:52.024 --> 35:55.036
On the contrary. They were
our knights in shining armour.

35:55.036 --> 35:58.028
Yoo-hoo! You can come out now!

36:03.096 --> 36:06.040
I won't get up.

36:06.040 --> 36:09.016
I'm Timothy Cudlip. These are
my brothers, Daryl and Lenny.

36:09.016 --> 36:11.092
There seems to have been
some sort of a misunderstanding.

36:13.040 --> 36:16.044
Then why did you hole yourself
up inside?

36:16.044 --> 36:22.044
Because you look like the sort to
shoot first and ask questions later.

36:36.012 --> 36:39.008
And all the time, you were held
in the back of their van?

36:39.008 --> 36:42.024
Until this morning,
when they drove us here

36:42.024 --> 36:45.004
and dumped us in the middle of
nowhere

36:45.004 --> 36:46.096
without so much as a by-your-leave!

36:49.000 --> 36:52.020
And this is when your rescuers
found you? Yes.

36:52.020 --> 36:54.056
May I enquire why you didn't
immediately call the police?

36:54.056 --> 36:56.016
Well, the telephone
was out of order.

36:56.016 --> 36:59.072
Yes.Can you give us any
descriptions of the kidnappers?

36:59.072 --> 37:02.008
No. They were wearing masks.

37:02.008 --> 37:04.012
But we did hear them talking,

37:04.012 --> 37:08.092
and one of them mentioned a cousin
in Anglesey?

37:08.092 --> 37:11.068
Anglesey, yes.With a boat.

37:11.068 --> 37:14.036
Forgive us, we're exhausted.

37:14.036 --> 37:17.032
I think my aunt has had quite enough
questions for today.

37:17.032 --> 37:19.052
I must return to the Earl.

37:19.052 --> 37:21.088
Of course, Your Ladyship. Yeah.

37:21.088 --> 37:25.028
I will be needing full statements
from you. Yes.

37:25.028 --> 37:27.036
When you have recovered.

37:33.072 --> 37:37.064
For Christian ladies,
you are very adept at lying.

37:37.064 --> 37:39.068
It's a long story.

37:39.068 --> 37:41.016
I can't wait.

37:48.016 --> 37:51.044
Do you reckon the kidnappers
are heading to Wales, then, sir?

37:51.044 --> 37:53.064
Get on the blower to Anglesey,

37:53.064 --> 37:56.060
see if they have wind
of any unusual sailings.

38:00.024 --> 38:02.012
I hear you're leaving.

38:02.012 --> 38:04.024
The police decided not to
press charges.

38:05.064 --> 38:08.044
I've been very lucky.
To get away with murder.

38:09.052 --> 38:11.012
I say, steady on.

38:11.012 --> 38:13.012
Even the police say
it was an accident.

38:13.012 --> 38:14.080
What gave you the right to judge?

38:14.080 --> 38:17.056
The only judge you need fear is God.

38:17.056 --> 38:19.036
Both of you.

38:19.036 --> 38:22.004
On a charge of matricide.

38:22.004 --> 38:26.012
Premeditated and coldblooded.

38:27.084 --> 38:30.056
I don't know
what you're talking about.

38:30.056 --> 38:34.028
An ex-convict called Leonard Cudlip

38:34.028 --> 38:39.000
wrote to your mother's charity
requesting a loan.

38:40.072 --> 38:44.052
Was that when you decided he'd be
the perfect scapegoat for murder?

38:45.064 --> 38:47.044
What's that?

38:47.044 --> 38:51.036
A little lie that exposed you.

38:55.032 --> 38:57.060
If you had been singed
by the match...

38:59.052 --> 39:01.036
..the stem would have been charred.

39:03.012 --> 39:05.000
Of what possible significance?

39:06.060 --> 39:08.060
Exactly.

39:08.060 --> 39:12.024
Why lie about something
so inconsequential?

39:12.024 --> 39:15.028
Unless it did have a meaning.

39:15.028 --> 39:18.028
You ordered the lights to be
shot out in the carriage,

39:18.028 --> 39:20.052
knowing you'd be in darkness,

39:20.052 --> 39:23.044
needing light just for a moment

39:23.044 --> 39:26.084
to get your target in your sights.

39:26.084 --> 39:29.060
You think that'll hold up
in a court of law?

39:33.000 --> 39:36.008
I'm only interested in
your immortal souls.

39:36.008 --> 39:37.072
It's not what you think.

39:37.072 --> 39:40.004
Barb!He knows, Tony.

39:40.004 --> 39:42.048
And I, for one,
can't live with the knowledge.

39:43.096 --> 39:46.020
I persuaded Tony.

39:46.020 --> 39:48.080
To protect the child.

39:50.052 --> 39:52.052
To protect Lucy from your mother?

39:52.052 --> 39:55.032
Oh, I do wish you wouldn't call her
that.

39:55.032 --> 39:57.068
Mothers bring up children.

39:57.068 --> 39:59.044
The only time we ever saw her

39:59.044 --> 40:02.020
was when she wheeled us out
for interviews.

40:02.020 --> 40:05.044
Playing happy families
with her adoring fans.

40:05.044 --> 40:08.032
Little did they know that we were
purchased as possessions.

40:08.032 --> 40:11.064
By a woman demanding unconditional
love and giving none in return!

40:11.064 --> 40:16.076
And now we are old and stale,
she set her eyes on a new victim.

40:16.076 --> 40:19.048
Lucky Lucy.

40:19.048 --> 40:21.024
There's irony.

40:21.024 --> 40:24.056
It was too late for us,
but not for her.

40:26.060 --> 40:28.028
WHISPERS:A life for a life!

40:31.072 --> 40:35.056
And what about the lives of the men
you callously framed for murder?

40:35.056 --> 40:37.096
They weren't supposed to get caught.

40:39.008 --> 40:40.084
We'd have let them keep the jewels.

40:41.096 --> 40:43.056
How magnanimous of you.

40:43.056 --> 40:45.008
And while we won't go to prison,

40:45.008 --> 40:47.060
we've been sentenced to
a lifetime of guilt.

40:47.060 --> 40:49.048
That will not be necessary.

40:50.092 --> 40:55.076
God sent his only son
to bear the burden of our sins.

40:57.036 --> 41:00.064
If only it were so simple.
It is...simple.

41:02.064 --> 41:04.048
Confess what is in your soul...

41:06.000 --> 41:10.044
..and if you are true...

41:10.044 --> 41:12.012
..you will be forgiven.

41:18.068 --> 41:21.004
COCKEREL CROWS

41:22.024 --> 41:26.064
Ah! Well, it seems the police
lost track of the robbers

41:26.064 --> 41:29.012
somewhere off the coast of Anglesey.

41:29.012 --> 41:30.092
Anglesey?

41:30.092 --> 41:33.036
Ah, yes, a little white lie.

41:34.028 --> 41:36.036
I'm surprised you didn't turn us in.

41:36.036 --> 41:38.040
I try to be a man of my word.

41:38.040 --> 41:43.016
So is my husband.
Apropos of which...for you.

41:43.016 --> 41:45.016
What's this?

41:49.004 --> 41:51.036
It's a cheque for a thousand pounds!
I can see that.

41:51.036 --> 41:53.048
I mean, what's she's giving it to us
for?

41:53.048 --> 41:55.092
The reward money for my safe return.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.084
We don't want it.We don't?

42:02.004 --> 42:04.028
After what we did, you think
we'd take your money?

42:04.028 --> 42:06.028
It will look jolly suspicious
if you don't.

42:06.028 --> 42:08.008
You aren't bad men.

42:08.008 --> 42:10.012
Although you are terrible cooks.

42:13.012 --> 42:14.060
