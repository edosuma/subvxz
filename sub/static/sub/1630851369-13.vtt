- I think
his epilepsy diagnosis

09:09.418 --> 09:12.029
was rushed at best,
negligent at worst.

09:12.073 --> 09:13.553
He was never referred
to a specialist,

09:13.596 --> 09:16.251
and no one ever confirmed it
with an MRI or an EEG.

09:16.294 --> 09:17.818
- If he's not having
epileptic seizures,

09:17.861 --> 09:19.515
then he shouldn't be
on anticonvulsants.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.125
- No.

09:21.169 --> 09:22.997
He needs to spend a few days
in a seizure monitoring unit.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.912
Undergo far more extensive
testing.

09:24.955 --> 09:26.217
- Yeah, I'll say.

09:26.261 --> 09:27.784
Okay, I'll check in
with Med's SMU,

09:27.828 --> 09:28.829
see if they have any room,

09:28.872 --> 09:30.221
and we can flip
the idea to Pete?

09:30.265 --> 09:31.222
- Yeah, that'd be great.
Thank you.

09:31.266 --> 09:32.223
- Okay. Yeah. I'll see you.

09:32.267 --> 09:33.964

- Yeah.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.840

with Dr. Blake.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.803

a question for her.

- Oh, come on.

09:56.334 --> 09:58.554
It was Valentine's Day
last week.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.382
She have any flowers
waiting in her office?

10:00.425 --> 10:02.384
She mention having plans?

10:02.427 --> 10:04.429
- What is this,
kind of hospital policy thing?

10:04.473 --> 10:06.431
- No, it's--I guess
it's a vibe thing.

10:06.475 --> 10:07.911
- A vibe thing?
- Yeah, I got a vibe.

10:07.955 --> 10:09.260

- Maybe she's interested,
you know.

10:11.219 --> 10:13.613

because I always thought

10:13.656 --> 10:15.702

upon workplace relationships.

10:15.745 --> 10:17.791
I mean, I clearly recall

10:17.834 --> 10:20.054

and I to HR.

to show up today.

10:45.296 --> 10:46.689

on the verge of collapse.

Oh, Maggie,

10:51.738 --> 10:52.826

10:52.869 --> 10:54.175

negative for COVID.

But I feel a little shaky.
Nauseated too.

to the right wrist.

- Okay, who called 911?
- She did.

11:31.691 --> 11:32.953

11:32.996 --> 11:34.737
My daughter was out
running an errand.

11:34.781 --> 11:36.304
- No, you did the right thing,
Mrs. Hendrix.

11:36.347 --> 11:37.697
It was good you called us.

11:37.740 --> 11:39.307
Her chart says
she doesn't have children?

11:39.350 --> 11:40.700
- Maybe she's confused.

11:40.743 --> 11:42.527
She did give us the number
for her daughter.

11:42.571 --> 11:44.921
- All right, we'll sort it out.

11:44.965 --> 11:46.096

Good.

I'm her daughter, Cindy.

12:02.199 --> 12:04.071

12:04.114 --> 12:06.769
Sorry, there was confusion
because her chart--

12:06.813 --> 12:08.989
- It says Lorraine
doesn't have kids.

12:09.032 --> 12:11.382
Technically she's my stepmom,
but she's been in my life

12:11.426 --> 12:13.080
since I was 13 years old.

12:13.123 --> 12:14.777
She lives with me now.

We'll make note.

at the hospital.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.750

- Exactly.

an X-ray of her wrist
