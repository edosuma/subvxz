00:50.415 --> 00:52.780
Frame up on camera two.

00:52.782 --> 00:56.813
Okay, looking good there.
Camera two, hold that frame.

00:56.815 --> 00:58.579
Chyron standing by.

00:58.581 --> 01:02.146
Coming to Sean in 20 seconds
for the five-day forecast.

01:02.148 --> 01:05.580
The entire time that I have been
covering the DTLA area for KPCK.

01:05.582 --> 01:10.814
The lines outside the health
food stores are incredible.

01:10.816 --> 01:13.546
Coming to Sean for weather
on camera two in...

01:13.548 --> 01:16.546
Speaking of which, Sean has news
on an annual weather event

01:16.548 --> 01:19.513
that Angelenos know
only too well.

01:19.515 --> 01:22.047
Good afternoon, Los Angeles!

01:22.049 --> 01:25.080
And like I always say,
"If you don't like the heat,

01:25.082 --> 01:27.713
get the hell out
of Southern California!"

01:27.715 --> 01:31.280
Yes, folks, nothing but blasted
sunshine on the ol' horizon

01:31.282 --> 01:33.213
for the next ten or so days.

01:33.215 --> 01:35.813
We are talking
some infernal heat.

01:35.815 --> 01:39.279
And not only is the dial
touching the big 104,

01:39.281 --> 01:42.514
but those devil winds
are blowing hot and dry

01:42.516 --> 01:45.279
from the Mojave Desert
down through San Bernardino

01:45.281 --> 01:47.813
and right across
the greater Los Angeles area.

01:47.815 --> 01:49.813
The annual Santa Anas
bringing with them

01:49.815 --> 01:52.247
their usual fire warning.

01:52.249 --> 01:55.147
The hot, dry gusts,
a real hazard...

01:56.815 --> 02:00.446
Beg your pardon.

02:00.448 --> 02:03.483
The hot, dry gusts
are a real hazard...

02:16.549 --> 02:19.116
The hot, dry gusts...

02:21.449 --> 02:23.379
Does this...

02:23.381 --> 02:25.312
Is this supposed
to be happening?

02:25.314 --> 02:28.112
Do I need to stop
and get him some water?

02:28.114 --> 02:31.048
I'm sorry, I just, uh...

02:37.648 --> 02:38.382
The hot...

02:42.249 --> 02:43.646
What the fuck
is going on here?

02:43.648 --> 02:45.547
Tony, frame up, camera two.

02:45.549 --> 02:46.747
All we have in this fucking
studio is news and weather.

02:46.749 --> 02:48.046
What else am I gonna find...

02:48.048 --> 02:49.312
Nix it!

02:49.314 --> 02:50.179
Frame on some fucking thing.

02:53.582 --> 02:54.680
Okay, great.

02:54.682 --> 02:56.814
Okay, back to news.

02:56.816 --> 03:00.312
- Uh...
- Okay, great.

03:00.314 --> 03:04.380
The world of cryptocurrency
in recent months

03:04.382 --> 03:06.813
has been, uh, hacked.

03:06.815 --> 03:09.380
I was having
a hard time breathing,

03:09.382 --> 03:10.446
but those were not tears.

03:10.448 --> 03:12.747
Okay, sure, whatever, whatever.

03:12.749 --> 03:14.246
Listen whatever happened
to you out there

03:14.248 --> 03:16.046
happened to you
and not me,

03:16.048 --> 03:19.447
but I am the one responsible
for what the viewers see,

03:19.449 --> 03:20.814
and the viewer saw tears.

03:20.816 --> 03:23.212
And that is very distressing
to them, okay?

03:23.214 --> 03:25.379
Bottom line, you need
to take some time off.

03:25.381 --> 03:27.179
- I'm telling you...
- You need a rest.

03:27.181 --> 03:28.380
It was gastric.

03:28.382 --> 03:31.146
It was like this
intense acid reflux,

03:31.148 --> 03:32.814
like I ate something
super bad.

03:32.816 --> 03:35.046
I'm sure that's a thing.
Is that your car?

03:35.048 --> 03:37.180
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's get you in it.

03:37.182 --> 03:38.579
Let's get you some rest.

03:38.581 --> 03:40.414
Take all the time
you need, okay?

03:40.416 --> 03:42.447
- I won't be long. I'm fine.
- Go there.

03:42.449 --> 03:43.683
- Thank you.
- All right.

03:50.748 --> 03:52.247
Hey.

03:52.249 --> 03:54.447
- Hey.
- Hi.

03:54.449 --> 03:56.513
You sure you should be
driving right now?

03:56.515 --> 03:59.614
Why wouldn't I be able to drive?

03:59.616 --> 04:01.513
Sean, you were sobbing.

04:01.515 --> 04:04.279
I had a thing with my body.

04:04.281 --> 04:06.814
And yes, okay, it might have
brought water to my eyes,

04:06.816 --> 04:08.647
but those were not tears.

04:08.649 --> 04:09.780
They weren't.

04:09.782 --> 04:12.582
I was not crying, okay?

04:14.181 --> 04:16.379
Okay, I better go.

04:16.380 --> 04:18.747
Carlos bought this weird tree
years ago,

04:18.749 --> 04:20.380
and it's just looking at me
on the deck.

04:20.382 --> 04:22.180
I don't want it around anymore.

04:22.182 --> 04:25.579
Some horticulturist I found
on eBay is picking it up today.

04:25.581 --> 04:27.580
- Hey, Sean?
- You know...

04:27.582 --> 04:30.413
maybe it's the Santa Ana winds.

04:30.415 --> 04:33.247
They drive the people loco.

04:33.249 --> 04:35.682
You know, my shrink
never did hear from you.

04:37.281 --> 04:39.046
Uh, yes...

04:39.048 --> 04:40.346
Which is fine. I mean...

04:40.348 --> 04:42.646
maybe it's not him,
maybe is not me,

04:42.648 --> 04:45.247
but you need
to speak to someone.

04:45.249 --> 04:47.079
- Yeah.
- All right.

04:47.081 --> 04:48.347
- Oh!
- I feel great.

04:48.349 --> 04:50.679
- Okay, good, okay.
- Yeah.

04:50.681 --> 04:52.680
Well, Sean, talk to somebody.

04:52.682 --> 04:53.813
Yeah, I will.

04:53.815 --> 04:55.282
Okay.

05:12.315 --> 05:13.813
Bye!

05:16.783 --> 05:20.546

05:24.481 --> 05:27.781

05:57.349 --> 06:00.580
He's selling this
because of the divorce?

06:00.582 --> 06:02.179
I don't know.

06:02.181 --> 06:06.279
My entire personality
is a product of divorce.

06:06.281 --> 06:07.813
It's true.

06:07.815 --> 06:09.379
And here we go.

06:09.381 --> 06:11.146
Definitively a divorce.

06:11.148 --> 06:13.546
- Sorry.
- Hi.

06:13.548 --> 06:15.812
Work is crazy.
I'm so sorry.

06:15.814 --> 06:17.280
- Amy?
- I'm Amy.

06:17.282 --> 06:19.547
- Hi. Sean.
- I'm Kate, friend.

06:19.549 --> 06:21.079
Nice to meet you.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.213
Had to make sure.

06:23.215 --> 06:26.047
Come on in.

06:26.049 --> 06:27.447
Right through here.

06:27.449 --> 06:30.380
Sorry.
It's a little bit of a mess.

06:30.382 --> 06:34.513
And... there she is.

06:34.515 --> 06:37.279
Wow. This is a nice house.

06:37.281 --> 06:40.646
Oh, there were two of us
chipping in, so...

06:40.648 --> 06:42.480
Ah, she's beautiful.

06:42.482 --> 06:43.414
Thank you.

06:43.416 --> 06:45.280
- Perfect.
- Yeah.

06:45.282 --> 06:48.147
All right, we go like this
and then... Ooh!

06:48.149 --> 06:50.747
That's some lazy-ass
workmanship.

06:50.749 --> 06:53.179
That's my ex for you.

06:53.181 --> 06:55.182
I say roll.

07:05.181 --> 07:07.547
<i>Hey, it's Carlos.
I can't take your call</i>

07:07.549 --> 07:10.246
<i>because I'm a busy
and important person.</i>

07:10.248 --> 07:11.813
<i>Leave a message.</i>

07:11.815 --> 07:13.714
Hey, it's me.

07:13.716 --> 07:18.113
Just wanted to let you know
that the big ol' tree is gone.

07:18.115 --> 07:19.779
Yeah.

07:19.781 --> 07:24.479
Some good friends of mine
just picked it up, so...

07:24.481 --> 07:26.713
That is it, Carlos.

07:26.715 --> 07:31.646
The last vestiges of us
have now been swept away.

07:31.648 --> 07:33.547
You don't have to call me back.
I know you won't.

07:33.549 --> 07:36.280
I'm not an idiot.

08:02.381 --> 08:05.215
<i>You have one new
voice message.</i>

08:06.782 --> 08:11.079
<i>You have 13 saved
voice messages.</i>

08:11.081 --> 08:12.146
I can do this.

08:12.148 --> 08:14.446
<i>First voice message.</i>

08:14.448 --> 08:18.279
<i>Sean, Ash. Just got out of
a chat with HR,</i>

08:18.281 --> 08:20.580
<i>and we want to reiterate
that you should go ahead</i>

08:20.582 --> 08:24.112
<i>and take all the time you need
to get better.</i>

08:24.114 --> 08:26.346
<i>You are a valuable
commodity, Sean.</i>

08:26.348 --> 08:28.313
- <i>They consulted your file,</i>
- Carlos!

08:28.315 --> 08:31.780
<i>and you haven't taken a single
vacation day in six months!</i>

08:31.782 --> 08:34.380
<i>So go ahead and rest up, Sean.</i>

08:34.381 --> 08:36.413
<i>Go to Cabo,
chill by the swim-up bar...</i>

08:36.414 --> 08:38.645
Goodbye.

09:01.715 --> 09:04.779
<i>So please, kind people,
no washing your car.</i>

09:04.781 --> 09:07.313
<i>No watering your lawn.</i>

09:07.315 --> 09:09.113
<i>Certainly no turning on
fire hydrants</i>

09:09.115 --> 09:10.247
<i>or jumping around in them.</i>

09:10.249 --> 09:11.713
<i>This is LA.</i>

09:11.715 --> 09:14.312
<i>Until water actually
falls from the sky,</i>

09:14.314 --> 09:16.249
<i>we can find another way
to be cool...</i>

09:17.315 --> 09:19.083
All right.

09:38.248 --> 09:39.546
Oh, hi. Excuse me.

09:39.548 --> 09:41.280
Hi. I need to do some painting.

09:41.282 --> 09:44.113
I'm just running some repairs
on my deck.

09:44.115 --> 09:45.280
- Okay.
- That's the name of the paint.

09:45.282 --> 09:46.550
Got it.
All right, one second.

09:54.182 --> 09:57.779
- All right.
- Oh, no, that's way too big.

09:57.781 --> 10:00.247
- Do you have a smaller one?
- Yeah. Give me one second.

10:00.249 --> 10:03.048
What's the smallest one
you have?

10:07.516 --> 10:09.780
- What about this one?
- Oh, that's perfect.

10:09.782 --> 10:12.480
I'm painting over this
itty-bitty, little circle.

10:12.482 --> 10:13.746
Oh, but once you paint that,

10:13.748 --> 10:14.813
won't you need to paint
the rest of it?

10:14.815 --> 10:16.547
For consistency.

10:16.549 --> 10:19.550
No, I don't think I will,
but thank you though.

10:20.647 --> 10:23.578
Hey, I seen you on TV, right?

10:23.580 --> 10:27.312
Oh, I get that a lot.
There's a guy who looks like me.

10:27.314 --> 10:28.313
Oh?

10:28.315 --> 10:31.812
But it's not me, so...

10:31.814 --> 10:34.079
Okay. Yeah.

10:34.081 --> 10:36.482
- Uh, my bad.
- Thank you, thank you.

11:05.448 --> 11:07.115
Oh, sorry.

11:57.648 --> 12:00.146
<i>Sean, honey, it's Stan.</i>

12:00.148 --> 12:02.379
<i>Thursday there's a party,
and you will attend.</i>

12:02.381 --> 12:04.379
<i>Question is,
what will you drink?</i>

12:04.381 --> 12:06.215
<i>I will pour anything
down my throat.</i>

12:07.246 --> 12:08.813
<i>I am an elderly homosexual,
but you young men,</i>

12:08.815 --> 12:11.080
<i>what would you even like
these days?</i>

12:11.082 --> 12:12.613
<i>I know the Cosmo
is played out.</i>

12:12.615 --> 12:14.645
<i>I know tequila
makes people cray,</i>

12:14.647 --> 12:17.379
<i>so, talk to me, advise.</i>

12:17.381 --> 12:19.380
<i>Also, where have you been?</i>

12:19.382 --> 12:22.413
<i>Tom tells me it's been a month
since we saw you.</i>

12:22.415 --> 12:24.446
<i>Do you still hike the
back track at Griffith Park?</i>

12:24.448 --> 12:25.812
<i>We do.</i>

12:25.814 --> 12:27.247
<i>You best not be holed up
in that house.</i>

12:27.249 --> 12:29.347
<i>That house is bad for you.</i>

12:29.349 --> 12:31.513
<i>Lonely nest on top of a hill.</i>

12:31.515 --> 12:34.678
<i>Okay, now, Thursday, attend.</i>

12:51.447 --> 12:54.812
<i>There are no seasons.
There is no, you know...</i>

12:54.814 --> 12:57.079
<i>In New York, it's like, "The
last time we saw each other</i>

12:57.081 --> 12:59.146
<i>we were all bundled up
in parkas, so...</i>

12:59.148 --> 13:01.713
<i>It must've been January
when I first moved down here.</i>

13:01.715 --> 13:04.812
<i>That's why he'd been here
for a few years longer.</i>

13:04.814 --> 13:09.047
<i>And he said in LA, you jump
into one end of the pool,</i>

13:09.049 --> 13:11.147
<i>you swim out to the other end,
you get out,</i>

13:11.149 --> 13:13.148
<i>and it's 20 years later.</i>

13:14.179 --> 13:16.046
<i>Yeah, it's bleak, but it's
also the beauty of this place.</i>

13:16.048 --> 13:18.079
<i>Yeah. It's, uh... Yeah.</i>

13:18.081 --> 13:21.645
<i>You kind of shrug your way
to a whole lifestyle.</i>

13:21.647 --> 13:23.812
<i>And we're so comfy,
we're not even leaving home</i>

13:23.814 --> 13:26.347
<i>because it takes
ten minutes too long</i>

13:26.349 --> 13:28.446
<i>to get to the beach
or to get to the east side,</i>

13:28.448 --> 13:30.813
<i>so it's like, well,
I'll just stay on my block</i>

13:30.815 --> 13:33.579
- <i>with my dozen friends</i>
- Okay.

13:33.581 --> 13:35.646
<i>and live out my life</i>

13:35.648 --> 13:39.312
<i>and be one of those old guys
with kinda longish hair</i>

13:39.314 --> 13:42.079
<i>and a weed prescription,
you know,</i>

13:42.081 --> 13:46.346
<i>and have like an extensive
vinyl collection</i>

13:46.348 --> 13:48.412
<i>and a bunch of house plants.</i>

13:48.414 --> 13:51.146
<i>Wait. I can see that this is...</i>

13:51.148 --> 13:55.180
<i>I can see that future for you,
and it sounds great.</i>

13:55.182 --> 13:57.246
<i>You can see that future for me
'cause it's my present.</i>

13:57.248 --> 13:59.312
<i>It's already happening.</i>

13:59.314 --> 14:02.212
<i>The lifestyle is very easy,</i>

14:02.214 --> 14:05.346
<i>so it is easy
not to challenge oneself.</i>

14:05.348 --> 14:06.381
Well, that's...

14:07.781 --> 14:10.148
He should have told me.

14:14.681 --> 14:20.246
<i>♪ It never rains

14:20.248 --> 14:24.112
<i>♪ But, girl,

14:24.114 --> 14:26.414
<i>♪ It pours ♪</i>

14:31.347 --> 14:33.679
I should've listened to you.

14:33.681 --> 14:35.479
- I get that a lot.
- I bet you do.

14:35.481 --> 14:38.213
Do you know how much more paint
you need?

14:38.215 --> 14:40.179
Uh, it's a deck.

14:40.181 --> 14:41.812
Is it wood?

14:41.814 --> 14:43.545
Yeah, it is wood.
Definitely.

14:43.547 --> 14:45.179
I know that much.
It's wood.

14:45.181 --> 14:47.113
- I know that.
- Do you know what kind of wood?

14:47.115 --> 14:48.715
Um...

14:50.615 --> 14:53.712
You know, it's like
a dark brown wood.

14:53.714 --> 14:56.746
Dark brown wood, right.
You know, let's take a look.

14:56.748 --> 14:59.216
- Yeah, yeah, let's look.
- All right.

15:07.480 --> 15:09.579
- Like last time.
- Here we go.

15:09.581 --> 15:11.813
This is just like you
recommended to me last time,

15:11.815 --> 15:14.513
- and I said no.
- Yeah.

15:14.515 --> 15:16.646
And I'm gonna need
a bigger brush.

15:16.648 --> 15:20.116
Oh, yes!
Okay, one second.

15:23.548 --> 15:24.713
- All right.
- Oh, wow.

15:24.715 --> 15:26.378
Oh, my gosh.
Look at all that.

15:26.380 --> 15:30.046
Got you a brush, some cloths,
and paint thinner.

15:30.048 --> 15:32.346
- Thank you so much.
- You're so welcome.

15:32.348 --> 15:34.579
- Thank you, Devan.
- Yes, you're welcome.

15:34.581 --> 15:36.413
I really appreciate it.

15:36.415 --> 15:38.745
I'll listen to you this time,
so I won't be back.

15:38.747 --> 15:40.715
Yeah, all right.
Take care.

15:57.548 --> 16:00.679
- Hello.
- Hola. ¿Qué onda?

16:00.681 --> 16:03.579
Whoa. Uh, how does this work,
you guys?

16:03.581 --> 16:06.047
- I need some painting done.
- ¿Qué?

16:06.049 --> 16:06.982
Um...

16:08.049 --> 16:09.212
Painting?

16:09.214 --> 16:11.812
Oh, pintura, sí.
Agarra a los tres.

16:11.814 --> 16:14.180
Oh, no. Uno.
Uno persona.

16:14.182 --> 16:15.612
No, agarra a los tres.

16:15.614 --> 16:17.513
I don't speak Spanish, okay?

16:17.515 --> 16:19.282
Hablo un poquito.

16:20.547 --> 16:22.278
Do you paint?

16:22.280 --> 16:23.646
Yeah.

16:23.648 --> 16:24.648
You paint?

16:27.514 --> 16:30.812
Sí. Yo paint.
$20 an hour.

16:30.814 --> 16:32.246
$20 an hour?

16:32.248 --> 16:34.779
- Sí.
- Bueno, bueno.

16:34.781 --> 16:37.349
Perfecto, yeah, yeah.

16:41.247 --> 16:43.545
Soy hombre de negocios, güey.

16:43.547 --> 16:44.578
Aprendan el inglés.

16:44.580 --> 16:46.982
Thank you. Sorry.

17:06.281 --> 17:09.310
I'm Sean.

17:09.313 --> 17:10.746
Sean.

17:10.748 --> 17:12.311
- Ernesto.
- Ernesto.

17:12.314 --> 17:14.515
Nice to meet you, Ernesto.

17:18.714 --> 17:22.083
Do you want music?
The radio?

17:24.480 --> 17:26.314
¿Quieres música?

17:45.148 --> 17:46.712
Yeah, that's too depressing.

17:48.681 --> 17:52.412
Radiohead or whoever that is
loves to complain.

17:52.414 --> 17:55.111
No entiendo, señor.
No, no hablo inglés.

17:55.113 --> 17:57.112
Oh, that's completely fine.

17:57.114 --> 18:00.579
I don't speak Spanish,
apart from a couple of words.

18:00.581 --> 18:03.745
Hablo un poquito español.

18:03.747 --> 18:07.182
So it's like
why would you speak English?

18:09.580 --> 18:12.478
<i>There's no sign
of rain on the horizon.</i>

18:12.480 --> 18:13.745
<i>Coastline is bone dry.</i>

18:41.180 --> 18:43.212
- Oh, no, it's okay, I got it.
- Está bien.

18:43.214 --> 18:45.613
- You have your bag?
- Está bien.

18:45.615 --> 18:48.312
Okay, you sure?

18:48.314 --> 18:49.649
Thank you.

18:56.781 --> 18:58.648
Right through here.

19:01.648 --> 19:04.378
Oh, are you thirsty?
You want water?

19:04.380 --> 19:06.448
Um, ¿quieres agua?

19:18.414 --> 19:20.111
Sorry. I should've asked you.

19:20.113 --> 19:24.312
This is sparkling,
but I have tap or still or...

19:24.314 --> 19:26.749
All right, yeah,
so the deck is just this way.

19:29.648 --> 19:31.546
Right through here.

19:31.548 --> 19:33.349
There it is.

19:34.781 --> 19:38.281
Oh, yeah, it's LA.

19:41.147 --> 19:42.812
Es más que un día.

19:42.814 --> 19:46.312
It's more than one day?
It's just a little circle.

19:46.314 --> 19:48.478
Si, pero hay mucho que hacer.

19:48.480 --> 19:51.212
Vez, mira hay que lijar todo
esto. Es más que un día.

19:51.214 --> 19:52.613
I don't know what that means,

19:52.615 --> 19:55.145
but more than one day
is in there, I guess?

19:55.147 --> 19:57.513
- Es more one day.
- More than one day.

19:57.515 --> 19:59.111
Two days?

19:59.113 --> 20:00.311
No sé.
Pero es más que un día.

20:00.313 --> 20:01.613
It's more than one day.

20:01.615 --> 20:02.578
More one day.

20:02.580 --> 20:04.382
Es más que one day.

20:06.314 --> 20:07.780
- Is more one day.
- Más que one day.

20:07.782 --> 20:10.479
Got it, yeah.

20:10.481 --> 20:13.015
Bueno, bueno.
Perfecto, yes.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.147
I'll set this down here
for you.

20:18.081 --> 20:19.215
Sorry.

20:36.281 --> 20:38.546
If we have one...
if I have one...

20:38.548 --> 20:40.716
it should be in here.

20:46.081 --> 20:48.048
Oh, there's a light.

20:49.747 --> 20:51.813
See it yet?

20:51.815 --> 20:53.181
Aha.

20:55.081 --> 20:56.515
That's what I thought.

20:58.281 --> 21:00.246
- Watch your head there.
- Yo lo llevo.

21:00.248 --> 21:01.349
Okay.

21:12.647 --> 21:13.648
¡Más agua!

21:19.815 --> 21:21.082
Yeah.

21:25.680 --> 21:27.311
Are you hungry?

21:27.313 --> 21:29.679
Do you want...
Do you bring your lunch?

21:29.681 --> 21:31.578
Do you, um, comer?

21:31.580 --> 21:33.713
Más tarde,
tengo mucho trabajo aquí.

21:33.715 --> 21:37.315
Okay, you like to eat later,
yeah? All right, um...

21:39.280 --> 21:41.612
You know what?
I'm gonna go out.

21:41.614 --> 21:43.346
Are you okay here?

21:43.348 --> 21:45.178
You all set?
You got everything you need?

21:45.180 --> 21:48.378
- If you need anything...
- It's okay, okay.

21:48.380 --> 21:50.246
Mi casa, su casa.

21:50.248 --> 21:52.312
- It's okay.
- Right? Okay.

21:52.314 --> 21:53.478
- It's okay.
- Okay?

21:53.480 --> 21:55.047
- It's okay.
- All right.

23:00.715 --> 23:02.148
Lunch!

23:03.548 --> 23:05.282
Lunch.

23:06.381 --> 23:09.515
Okey, ¿cómo estamos aquí?

23:23.181 --> 23:24.778
No, no, lunch.

23:24.780 --> 23:28.446
Inside.
I brought it for us.

23:28.448 --> 23:30.448
- Aquí teng...
- Come on, lunch.

23:32.813 --> 23:35.681
Lunch, lunch.

23:36.780 --> 23:38.449
Lunch.

23:46.614 --> 23:48.045
Oh, no, no, no.

23:48.047 --> 23:51.178
¡Sí! Sí, por favor.
Siéntate.

23:51.180 --> 23:52.747
Comer.

24:01.813 --> 24:03.078
Napkins.

24:03.080 --> 24:05.581
You gotta try these.

24:13.548 --> 24:15.412
It's good, isn't it?

24:15.414 --> 24:17.478
Bueno?
Yeah, I know, right?

24:17.480 --> 24:20.046
Great Vietnamese place
down the street.

24:20.048 --> 24:21.812
We go...
I go there all the time.

24:21.814 --> 24:25.079
The lines are crazy,
but it's worth it, I think.

24:25.081 --> 24:27.215
And the reviews on Yelp
are off the scale.

24:34.681 --> 24:35.712
Taquitos.

24:35.714 --> 24:37.715
Yeah.

25:05.614 --> 25:09.645
"It was just a flash flood."

25:15.547 --> 25:19.247
"I talk to people
all the time."

25:56.080 --> 25:58.378
Finito.

25:58.380 --> 26:00.145
- Finito.
- ¿Finito?

26:00.147 --> 26:01.778
No, it looks great.
I love it.

26:01.780 --> 26:04.079
Pero, um, más tarde.

26:04.081 --> 26:06.145
- Okay? Follow me.
- Más tarde.

26:06.147 --> 26:07.981
- Yeah?
- Sale.

26:09.646 --> 26:10.981
Vamos.

26:12.515 --> 26:14.779
It's a surprise, okay?
Sorpresa?

26:14.781 --> 26:16.647
Sorpresa, sí.

26:19.713 --> 26:21.645
¡Caray!

26:21.647 --> 26:23.413
Gotcha.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.512
- There you go.
- Gracias.

26:25.514 --> 26:27.514
Un momento, okay?
Un momento.

26:45.214 --> 26:46.147
Ernesto!

26:47.248 --> 26:48.215
Órale, pues. Ándale.

26:52.148 --> 26:55.778
¡Raspados de piña colada
y tamarindo!

26:55.780 --> 26:58.145
Te conoció el muchacho.

26:58.147 --> 27:00.446
- What?
- Te conoció.

27:00.448 --> 27:02.279
- He knows who I am?
- Sí.

27:02.281 --> 27:05.678
Oh, he... probably thinks
I'm somebody else.

27:05.680 --> 27:08.047
- Happens sometimes.
- Ah.

27:15.048 --> 27:16.315
Ta-da!

27:17.814 --> 27:19.212
No.

27:19.214 --> 27:20.413
I rented it for us.

27:20.415 --> 27:21.779
No.

27:21.781 --> 27:24.445
- Oh, come on, get in.
- No, no, no.

27:24.447 --> 27:25.345
Oh, come on.

27:25.347 --> 27:26.379
No. Tú put atrás.

27:26.381 --> 27:28.611
No, no, I'm gonna row.

27:28.613 --> 27:30.212
Yo lo hago.

27:30.214 --> 27:32.744
Okay, if you hago,
will you get in?

27:32.746 --> 27:34.678
Ponte atrás. Ponte atrás.

27:34.680 --> 27:36.045
- You'll get in?
- Sí.

27:36.047 --> 27:37.747
Okay, yeah, all right.

27:40.613 --> 27:42.346
You got it? You got it?

27:42.348 --> 27:43.413
Okay?

27:43.415 --> 27:44.778
Ahí estamos.

27:44.780 --> 27:46.312
All right.

27:46.314 --> 27:47.613
Okay.

27:53.080 --> 27:55.278
Oh, wow.

27:55.280 --> 27:57.514
You're good at this.

28:02.114 --> 28:03.678
This is so great.

28:03.680 --> 28:05.278
Gracias.

28:05.280 --> 28:08.311
I haven't done this
in such a long time.

28:08.313 --> 28:09.677
It's not really something
you do on your own.

28:09.679 --> 28:11.779
That would look very odd.

28:11.781 --> 28:15.179
Actually, the lake was closed
for a few years.

28:15.181 --> 28:19.645
They drained it.
It's been cleaned, restored.

28:19.647 --> 28:21.678
Have you done this before?
Another time?

28:21.680 --> 28:23.577
¿Otro tiempo?

28:23.579 --> 28:25.312
Last time I was here,

28:25.314 --> 28:28.779
this massive seagull
shit on my arm.

28:28.781 --> 28:31.279
You know, a bird.
Like that.

28:31.281 --> 28:32.812
Caca. Splat.

28:32.814 --> 28:36.481
Can you imagine
shitting on someone's arm?

28:40.380 --> 28:45.111
You think I'm crazy,
don't you?

28:45.113 --> 28:47.611
I bet you think I'm crazy.
Loco.

28:47.613 --> 28:49.311
Un poco, sí.

28:49.313 --> 28:50.415
Sí.

28:52.414 --> 28:55.445
I'm not really crazy.

28:55.447 --> 28:58.046
But I'll confess I am
going through a rough patch.

28:58.048 --> 29:01.711
My ex has been gone
for six months now,

29:01.713 --> 29:04.412
and since then,
I've been in this... state

29:04.414 --> 29:06.245
that I can't seem
to move beyond,

29:06.247 --> 29:08.677
and I can't seem
to stop making it worse.

29:08.679 --> 29:11.680
I had a bit of a moment
at work the other day.

29:12.747 --> 29:14.477
Bad, like a bad moment.

29:14.479 --> 29:16.811
And because of that,
I've been given gardening leave,

29:16.813 --> 29:20.046
even though
I only have a deck.

29:20.048 --> 29:23.512
This is the longest stretch
I've ever been alone for.

29:23.514 --> 29:25.677
And I have to admit,
I'm not good at being alone.

29:25.679 --> 29:27.645
I never have been.
I just don't know how to do it.

29:27.647 --> 29:31.678
Since Carlos left,
I have thrown myself into work,

29:31.680 --> 29:33.648
and now that that's gone,
it's all just a bit...

29:38.380 --> 29:39.711
Maybe everyone had a point.

29:39.713 --> 29:41.345
For the last six months,
people have been saying,

29:41.347 --> 29:43.178
"Talk to someone,"
and I've been saying,

29:43.180 --> 29:44.611
"Well, I would, but I'm just not
very good at that."

29:44.613 --> 29:46.612
But maybe those
that are bad at it

29:46.614 --> 29:49.179
are those that get
the greatest benefit, you know?

29:49.181 --> 29:50.812
I can't believe
how much better I feel.

29:50.814 --> 29:54.578
Even for having said
as much I have to you, it...

29:54.580 --> 29:56.681
feels good to talk.

30:01.479 --> 30:03.079
Anyone ever tell you

30:03.081 --> 30:05.248
that you are
a very good listener, Ernesto?

32:22.747 --> 32:24.681
Qué bonito.

32:30.414 --> 32:32.078
- Hey.
- Oh, my gosh.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.211
Sleep well?

32:33.213 --> 32:34.344
I guess I did.

32:34.346 --> 32:35.480
- Thank you.
- Sure.

32:38.047 --> 32:40.677
You guys got a "Driving
Miss Daisy" thing going on.

32:42.614 --> 32:47.082
He's my friend, and he speaks
perfectly good English, so...

32:48.714 --> 32:50.545
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was just saying since he's...

32:50.547 --> 32:53.644
Since he's what?

32:53.646 --> 32:57.045
Since he's... he's rowing.

32:57.047 --> 32:58.744
Uh, I don't know,
I don't know.

32:58.746 --> 33:03.081
Well, let's just ease up with
all the lazy assumptions, okay?

33:10.547 --> 33:12.145
Fuck.

33:12.147 --> 33:14.111
Sorry about that.

33:29.680 --> 33:33.079
So, mañana...

33:33.081 --> 33:34.079
¿Mañana?

33:34.081 --> 33:36.677
You work? ¿Trabajas?

33:36.679 --> 33:38.310
Sí, trabajo mañana.

33:38.312 --> 33:39.812
At the hardwood store?

33:39.814 --> 33:41.348
Store, sí.

33:43.247 --> 33:46.111
Because the painting,
it's more than one day.

33:46.113 --> 33:47.144
You said it.

33:47.146 --> 33:48.811
Es más que un día.

33:48.813 --> 33:51.344
Sí. More one day.

33:51.346 --> 33:53.045
So, ¿mañana?

33:53.047 --> 33:54.611
Claro que sí.

33:54.613 --> 33:56.677
What time?

33:56.679 --> 33:58.045
Mañana a las ocho.

33:58.047 --> 34:00.210
8 a.m.

34:00.212 --> 34:02.277
8 a.m. at the hardware store.

34:02.279 --> 34:03.611
- Store.
- Okay!

34:03.613 --> 34:05.513
Okay, it's a date.

34:33.047 --> 34:34.513
There you go.

34:39.447 --> 34:41.081
Gracias.

35:12.513 --> 35:17.110
That was the weirdest bit on TV
the other day.

35:17.112 --> 35:19.111
I didn't know they let you
just roll with shit.

35:19.113 --> 35:20.511
Just improvise, you know?

35:20.513 --> 35:23.245
I nearly fell off the treadmill.

35:23.247 --> 35:26.144
We try to keep it fresh.
We're good that way.

35:26.146 --> 35:27.344
Great. I loved it.

35:27.346 --> 35:28.811
Thank you.

35:37.479 --> 35:39.711
<i>Hey, it's Carlos.
I can't take your call</i>

35:39.713 --> 35:42.478
<i>because I'm busy
and important person.</i>

35:42.480 --> 35:44.445
<i>Leave a message.</i>

35:44.447 --> 35:46.144
Hey, it's me.

35:46.146 --> 35:51.045
Um, just wanted
to let you know that...

35:51.047 --> 35:53.577
I met someone.

35:53.579 --> 35:57.110
Yeah, so you don't have
to worry about me.

35:57.112 --> 36:00.411
I met someone,
and I am doing great.

36:00.413 --> 36:03.080
He's terrific, so...

36:23.747 --> 36:25.545
Oh!

36:25.547 --> 36:28.081
Oh, mi chamba.
Nos vemos, ¿eh?

36:31.813 --> 36:33.246
Morning.

36:40.514 --> 36:42.378
Ready for a buen día?

36:42.380 --> 36:45.145
You like hiking?

36:45.147 --> 36:47.811
- Hiking?
- Yeah, do you hike?

36:47.813 --> 36:49.277
Hike.

36:49.279 --> 36:51.144
- No.
- Um...

36:51.146 --> 36:55.244
Hiking, it's like, um,
like walking.

36:55.246 --> 36:57.477
Ambulamos.

36:57.479 --> 36:58.545
For no reason.

36:58.547 --> 37:01.111
Up a hill, you know?

37:01.113 --> 37:02.512
- Hiking.
- No.

37:02.514 --> 37:03.812
No?

37:03.814 --> 37:06.211
Sometimes I go
up to Runyon Canyon,

37:06.213 --> 37:09.210
but there are a lot of actors
and actresses

37:09.212 --> 37:10.611
and a few meth heads
here and there,

37:10.613 --> 37:12.377
but they don't bother you,
you know?

37:12.379 --> 37:14.511
Just leave 'em alone,
they'll leave you alone.

37:14.513 --> 37:17.144
And yeah, it's pretty peaceful,
nice views.

37:17.146 --> 37:19.211
And then Fryman's great, too.

37:19.213 --> 37:20.811
It's a little bit harder
to get to,

37:20.813 --> 37:23.111
but it's got
some really great paths,

37:23.113 --> 37:24.711
although I did see
a snake there.

37:24.713 --> 37:26.644
Snake?
Like a rattlesnake.

37:28.446 --> 37:31.744
Lots of dogs on the hikes.
You know, muchos perros.

37:31.746 --> 37:35.278
Yeah, me gusta perros.
I like the pequeño.

37:35.280 --> 37:36.478
- Pequeño perros.
- Chihuahua.

37:36.480 --> 37:39.044
Chihuahua, yeah.
You like Chihuahuas?

37:39.046 --> 37:43.712
Chihuahua es un estado
en México.

37:43.714 --> 37:46.377
Chihuahua is a state in Mexico.

37:46.379 --> 37:49.110
Very LA.

37:49.112 --> 37:51.114
Very Los Angeles.

37:52.480 --> 37:54.744
Este... vamos
¿hasta arriba allá?

37:54.746 --> 37:57.678
What, to the top? Sí.

37:57.680 --> 37:59.812
¿Hasta arriba es el trabajo?

37:59.814 --> 38:03.078
No, no, no, no, no,
this is el trabajo.

38:03.080 --> 38:04.512
The walking.

38:04.514 --> 38:06.144
Aquí es el trabajo.

38:06.146 --> 38:08.345
- ¿Caminar es el trabajo?
- Sí, walking.

38:08.347 --> 38:10.578
- For work.
- No painting?

38:10.580 --> 38:12.745
Más tarde, más tarde.

38:12.747 --> 38:15.611
¿Vale? ¿Por favor?

38:15.613 --> 38:17.078
- ¿Por favor?
- Vale, vale.

38:17.080 --> 38:19.145
¡Vale!

38:20.746 --> 38:21.714
Hello.

38:26.147 --> 38:27.711
How do you say "gay"
in Spanish?

38:27.713 --> 38:29.144
¿Qué?

38:29.146 --> 38:31.311
¿Cómo se dice
the men para allá?

38:31.313 --> 38:32.612
Ah, maricón.

38:32.614 --> 38:34.645
Maricón.

38:34.647 --> 38:36.779
En ingles es "faggot," no?

38:36.781 --> 38:37.981
Oh!

38:39.413 --> 38:40.514
Sort of.

38:42.046 --> 38:43.411
Soy...

38:43.413 --> 38:45.677
Maricón, sí, ya lo sé.

38:45.679 --> 38:47.144
Y yo tengo cinco hijos.

38:47.146 --> 38:48.645
You have five kids?

38:48.647 --> 38:50.712
Yes, five kids, I have.

38:50.714 --> 38:52.045
And a wife.

38:52.047 --> 38:54.078
Sí, y una esposa también.

38:54.080 --> 38:56.677
Y los hijos, ¿cuánto...

38:56.679 --> 38:58.744
El más chico tiene seis años,

38:58.746 --> 39:02.077
y el más grande,
tiene treinta y ocho.

39:02.079 --> 39:04.111
Six years old
to twenty-five years old.

39:04.113 --> 39:05.478
Sí. No, no, no.

39:05.480 --> 39:07.177
- Treinta y ocho.
- 35 years old.

39:07.179 --> 39:09.077
- Ocho.
- 38. Sorry.

39:09.079 --> 39:10.545
Sí, sí.

39:10.547 --> 39:12.110
How old are you?

39:12.112 --> 39:14.177
Yo tengo cincuenta cinco años.

39:14.179 --> 39:16.644
- So you're fifty-five?
- Sí.

39:16.646 --> 39:18.077
Oh.

39:18.079 --> 39:22.178
Y también...
y soy un abuelo.

39:22.180 --> 39:23.810
- You're a grandfather?
- Sí.

39:23.812 --> 39:25.311
Oh, my God.

39:25.313 --> 39:26.714
Estoy viejo.

39:30.212 --> 39:31.280
Wow.

39:35.046 --> 39:37.111
So clear today.

39:37.113 --> 39:38.347
- Claro.
- Claro.

39:42.113 --> 39:45.110
Where do you live?

39:45.112 --> 39:46.178
¿Por qué?

39:46.180 --> 39:48.411
Oh, no, I'm just curious.

39:48.413 --> 39:49.678
It's no big deal, you know.

39:49.680 --> 39:51.715
You could see the whole city,
so I...

39:54.614 --> 39:56.345
Para allá.

39:56.347 --> 39:57.511
Pico Rivera.

39:57.513 --> 39:58.544
Pico Rivera?

40:00.146 --> 40:01.277
Near Whittier.

40:01.279 --> 40:02.747
- Is far.
- Oh.

40:08.379 --> 40:09.811
Mira.

40:09.813 --> 40:11.711
Oh, my gosh!

40:11.713 --> 40:14.714
Look at your family! Wow!

40:17.080 --> 40:18.311
Is that...
Is he your son?

40:18.313 --> 40:20.811
No, no son.
Es mi cuñado.

40:20.813 --> 40:23.512
- Vivimos en su casa.
- Oh, he's your brother.

40:23.514 --> 40:25.612
No, no, no, mi esposa...

40:25.614 --> 40:26.778
Oh, he's your brother-in-law.

40:26.780 --> 40:29.444
Okay, lo siento, lo siento.

40:29.446 --> 40:32.210
Wow.

40:32.212 --> 40:33.811
Beautiful family.

40:33.813 --> 40:36.044
Gracias.

40:36.046 --> 40:37.743
You're lucky.

40:37.745 --> 40:38.980
Sí.

40:41.212 --> 40:44.044
You know, while we're up here,
will you take my picture?

40:44.046 --> 40:45.810
- Take a picture for me?
- Sí, sí, claro.

40:45.812 --> 40:49.278
Okay, just, uh...

40:49.280 --> 40:51.712
hit that button right there.

40:51.714 --> 40:54.114
Yeah? Okay.

40:57.147 --> 40:58.512
Alrighty.

40:58.514 --> 41:00.211
Ah!

41:00.213 --> 41:01.512
Hey, Sean!

41:01.514 --> 41:02.611
Oh, my... Tom!

41:02.613 --> 41:03.777
Hi! How are you?

41:03.779 --> 41:05.577
I'm good, man.
How are you?

41:05.579 --> 41:07.077
- I'm good, good.
- Good to see ya.

41:07.079 --> 41:09.310
Good to see you, yeah.
This is Ernesto.

41:09.312 --> 41:11.044
Hey, do you guys
want a picture?

41:11.046 --> 41:13.478
Yes!
Yeah, that's a great idea.

41:13.480 --> 41:15.478
I'll take that.

41:15.480 --> 41:17.344
I got it, honey.
You get in.

41:17.346 --> 41:18.380
Come on, over here.

41:20.513 --> 41:22.578
Here we go.

41:25.680 --> 41:27.345
Cute couple.

41:27.347 --> 41:29.278
Oh.

41:29.280 --> 41:30.710
There you go.

41:30.712 --> 41:32.545
So listen,
we're gonna see you tomorrow.

41:32.547 --> 41:34.512
- Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.
- Great.

41:34.514 --> 41:37.311
- Looking forward to it.
- Likewise. Okay, bye.

41:37.313 --> 41:39.081
- Tell Stan I say hi.
- I will.

41:43.146 --> 41:44.511
Mi amigo.

41:44.513 --> 41:45.378
Claro.

41:45.380 --> 41:47.046
Let's see.

41:49.813 --> 41:51.511
Ooh! Oh, you look good
in that one, don't you?

41:53.047 --> 41:55.214
- Con permiso.
- Yeah, please, go ahead.

42:50.280 --> 42:53.478
- Es mi esposa.
- Oh, it's your wife.

42:53.480 --> 42:56.578
Mi llama, say hello,
where are you?

42:56.580 --> 42:59.577
Oh, she worries about you.

42:59.579 --> 43:01.610
You're a lucky man.

43:01.612 --> 43:06.177
Si, lucky, pero, ¿sabes qué?
Estar casado es trabajo.

43:06.179 --> 43:07.511
Yes! It is work.

43:07.513 --> 43:09.478
Yeah. Like painting.

43:09.480 --> 43:11.377
Sí, sí.

43:11.379 --> 43:13.277
Painting more one day.

43:13.279 --> 43:14.777
Así nomás, el primer día.

43:14.779 --> 43:17.676
Big, yeah.

43:17.678 --> 43:21.046
Yeah.

43:24.547 --> 43:27.511
Yeah, every day is different.
Yeah, every day is different.

43:27.513 --> 43:31.246
Right? One day at a time.

43:38.646 --> 43:41.314
Go down?
Yeah, let's do it, okay.

43:46.613 --> 43:48.647
It's so pretty up here,
isn't it?

43:52.645 --> 43:56.377
You know, the truth is,
I don't care about the weather.

43:56.379 --> 43:58.210
I never wanted to be
a weatherman.

43:58.212 --> 44:00.411
And there's nothing special
about being one either.

44:00.413 --> 44:02.311
Maybe they used to,

44:02.313 --> 44:04.478
but they don't actually know
anything about the weather.

44:04.480 --> 44:06.177
Anything more than you or I.

44:06.179 --> 44:09.078
They just know
how to be on camera.

44:09.080 --> 44:10.445
I was trying
to do other stuff,

44:10.447 --> 44:13.110
and I just fell into
reading the weather.

44:13.112 --> 44:15.810
And then you get known for it.
You can't do other stuff.

44:15.812 --> 44:18.110
You're getting paid.

44:18.112 --> 44:20.110
I'll let you in on a secret.

44:20.112 --> 44:22.511
I never even wanted
to live in LA.

44:22.513 --> 44:24.810
Look, look at my skin.

44:24.812 --> 44:28.311
It looks tan,
but I have lots of freckles.

44:28.313 --> 44:29.810
A friend of Carlos
had this dog

44:29.812 --> 44:31.711
who could not stand
the weather here.

44:31.713 --> 44:36.210
I mean, permanently listless,
chapped nose, hardly ate.

44:36.212 --> 44:37.543
He sent him back east,

44:37.545 --> 44:39.543
and he is so damn happy
ever since.

44:39.545 --> 44:41.111
That's me!

44:41.113 --> 44:43.677
I'm just completely opposed
to nature.

44:43.679 --> 44:46.211
I guess I've always harbored
a perverse attraction

44:46.213 --> 44:48.378
towards the things
that are the worst for me.

44:48.380 --> 44:50.610
It's internalized homophobia,
you know?

44:50.612 --> 44:52.412
Blah, blah, fuckin' blah,
I know.

44:52.414 --> 44:53.810
It's the oldest story
in the book,

44:53.812 --> 44:57.278
but we're encoded
at such a young age.

44:57.280 --> 44:58.810
For the longest time, Ernesto,

44:58.812 --> 45:02.311
I was only ever attracted
to straight married men.

45:02.313 --> 45:06.345
My subconscious had clearly
decided to build a wall

45:06.347 --> 45:08.710
to thwart my own happiness,

45:08.712 --> 45:12.044
to protect me from feelings
of self-loathing.

45:12.046 --> 45:14.277
It's like why are we programmed
to thwart our own happiness?

45:14.279 --> 45:16.045
No te entiendo.

45:16.047 --> 45:17.811
That's okay.
Just let me finish.

45:17.813 --> 45:20.311
Then after years
of unhappiness,

45:20.313 --> 45:23.178
of dumb sessions
with married men,

45:23.180 --> 45:26.178
on a shitty work trip
to Lake Tahoe,

45:26.180 --> 45:29.277
I found a guy I really liked,

45:29.279 --> 45:31.177
and he liked me right back.

45:31.179 --> 45:36.045
And I'm telling you, Ernesto,
it felt like a fucking miracle.

45:36.047 --> 45:38.981
And now, here I am.

45:41.080 --> 45:44.278
Talk about a vicious circle.

45:44.280 --> 45:46.444
Do you think LA
is haunted?

45:46.446 --> 45:47.544
No sé lo que es eso.

45:47.546 --> 45:49.045
I know, right?
You can feel it.

45:49.047 --> 45:50.377
Algo...

45:50.379 --> 45:53.412
It's layer after layer
of sadness,

45:53.414 --> 45:56.513
settling into the city
like sedimentary rock.

45:58.279 --> 45:59.278
Water?

45:59.280 --> 46:01.277
Gracias.

46:01.279 --> 46:03.611
I guess we're all nuts
in different ways.

46:03.613 --> 46:06.345
You probably have your own
neuroses and tics.

46:06.347 --> 46:08.178
What are you scared of?

46:08.180 --> 46:11.511
Uh... bueno la inmigración.

46:11.513 --> 46:14.177
Oh, immigration.
Yeah, that's...

46:14.179 --> 46:15.714
That is scary..

46:18.047 --> 46:19.778
I'm sorry about that.

46:19.780 --> 46:22.511
<i>With California in the
midst of a severe drought...</i>

46:22.513 --> 46:24.311
I always come here
after a hike.

46:24.313 --> 46:28.345
There's so many great...
vegatales y frutas.

46:28.347 --> 46:30.677
You know what?
I have a surprise for you.

46:30.679 --> 46:32.214
I'll be right back.

46:43.212 --> 46:45.410
Dude, you're late!

46:45.412 --> 46:47.746
The other ones
are already at the truck.

46:52.080 --> 46:53.113
Lo siento.

46:55.247 --> 46:56.314
Just take those.

47:00.478 --> 47:01.546
Lo siento.

47:05.613 --> 47:08.443
Ta-da!
Here you go.

47:08.445 --> 47:10.611
Here, take that one.
It's more.

47:10.613 --> 47:12.413
Yeah, okay?

47:16.678 --> 47:18.576
No, está malo.

47:18.578 --> 47:21.078
Well, yeah, I guess it doesn't
actually taste good,

47:21.080 --> 47:23.377
but I suppose the way it tastes
is not their aim.

47:23.379 --> 47:24.577
It's health.

47:24.579 --> 47:26.376
Está malo.

47:26.378 --> 47:28.376
You're right.
It's fuckin' vile.

47:28.378 --> 47:31.580
But I'm gonna drink it anyway
'cause it cost 15 bucks.

47:33.346 --> 47:34.444
Whoo!

47:34.446 --> 47:35.644
- Want that one?
- No, no, no.

47:35.646 --> 47:37.580
Hold my nose for this one.

47:39.378 --> 47:40.679
Whoo!

47:53.146 --> 47:55.711
¿Terminanos?

47:55.713 --> 47:59.544
Oh! Oh, yeah, okay.

47:59.546 --> 48:03.711
I'll drop you back
to the hardware store?

48:03.713 --> 48:05.546
Sí, the store.

48:07.046 --> 48:10.210
Again, gracias for today.

48:10.212 --> 48:12.013
Para hoy.

48:15.046 --> 48:18.277
¿Ya no pintamos?
¿Pintar?

48:18.279 --> 48:20.981
No, no painting, no.

48:23.513 --> 48:26.147
We didn't paint today.

48:34.678 --> 48:36.144
Here you go.

48:36.146 --> 48:38.081
Gracias.

48:40.478 --> 48:42.677
Wait, uh, ¿mañana?

48:42.679 --> 48:45.045
¿Mañana? ¿Pintar mañana?

48:45.047 --> 48:48.579
Sí, some painting
and then something más tarde.

48:49.813 --> 48:52.343
It's a thing.
A fun thing.

48:52.345 --> 48:53.543
It'll be fun.

48:53.545 --> 48:55.045
Sale.

48:55.047 --> 48:55.778
Mañana aqui.

48:55.780 --> 48:57.114
Mañana aqui.

50:25.813 --> 50:28.209
<i>You have
one new voice message.</i>

50:29.612 --> 50:32.576
<i>Seanie, they're saying rain?</i>

50:32.578 --> 50:34.411
<i>Is that even possible?
I mean...</i>

50:34.413 --> 50:36.376
<i>it's dry as a bone out there,</i>

50:36.378 --> 50:38.411
<i>and I cannot remember
what clouds look like,</i>

50:38.413 --> 50:41.543
<i>and yet rain is forecast.</i>

50:41.545 --> 50:44.209
<i>Isn't that wild?
LA is so weird.</i>

50:44.211 --> 50:47.309
<i>Anyway, this is
a flimsy pretext</i>

50:47.311 --> 50:49.980
<i>for me saying I miss you,
so call me.</i>

50:56.346 --> 50:58.510
I'm just too afraid
to have you as an enemy.

50:58.512 --> 51:01.243
- Hi.
- Damn right.

51:01.245 --> 51:04.209
Oh, I see you brought a guest.
I'm so happy for you.

51:04.211 --> 51:08.210
Hey. I met Ernesto yesterday
with Sean when I was hiking.

51:08.212 --> 51:10.447
Ernesto, this is
my husband Stanley.

51:11.780 --> 51:13.446
Come on in.

51:20.211 --> 51:21.543
Oh, my gosh, hi.

51:21.545 --> 51:23.443
Nice to see you, hi.

51:23.445 --> 51:25.443
- How are you? It's been awhile.
- I'm good, I'm good.

51:25.445 --> 51:26.544
Hi, I'm Mike.

51:26.546 --> 51:28.310
Oh, sorry.
This is Ernesto.

51:28.312 --> 51:30.044
Ernesto, mucho gusto.

51:30.046 --> 51:31.309
So how'd you guys meet?

51:31.311 --> 51:34.077
How did we meet?
We, um...

51:34.079 --> 51:36.244
We met at the hardware store.

51:36.246 --> 51:37.447
I get it.

51:41.712 --> 51:45.110
Nobody wants to say
they met on Grindr.

51:45.112 --> 51:46.710
Yes, yes.

51:46.712 --> 51:49.443
Precisely, it's...

51:49.445 --> 51:51.711
Come say hi
to Ben and Dave.

51:51.713 --> 51:55.210
Oh, okay, sure, yeah.
You wanna...

51:55.212 --> 51:57.411
- Uh...
- Oh, okay.

51:57.413 --> 51:59.513
I'll bring him right back,
all right?

52:37.111 --> 52:39.043
Hey, everything okay?

52:39.045 --> 52:41.710
Yes, uh, okay.
Everything, everything.

52:41.712 --> 52:43.577
All right, you wanna come
meet some of my amigos?

52:43.579 --> 52:45.080
¿Amigos? Claro.

54:36.812 --> 54:38.212
Yes.

54:43.678 --> 54:46.443
Esta la sé.

54:46.445 --> 54:49.477
- You know this song?
- Sí.

54:49.479 --> 54:52.477
Will you turn this up?

54:52.479 --> 54:54.209
Thank you.

54:58.111 --> 55:00.210
Come on, Ernesto,
let's see what you got.

55:00.212 --> 55:02.213
- Es Madonna.
- Let's see what you got.

55:03.512 --> 55:06.179
Yes! I like it.

55:13.179 --> 55:14.711
A ver, a ver. a ver,
viene la palabra.

55:14.713 --> 55:18.176

Hi, Sean, hi.

01:00:54.512 --> 01:00:58.044
Hi. You look... relaxed.

01:00:58.046 --> 01:01:00.410
Yeah, yeah, I feel great.
Super chill.

01:01:00.412 --> 01:01:02.477
But focused, you know?

01:01:02.479 --> 01:01:04.575
Just ready.
Ready to get back to work.

01:01:04.577 --> 01:01:06.176
Right now?

01:01:06.178 --> 01:01:08.575
No, no.

01:01:08.577 --> 01:01:09.809
Not now, not today.

01:01:09.811 --> 01:01:11.809
Okay.

01:01:11.811 --> 01:01:14.476
'Cause you just came in like...
brah!

01:01:14.478 --> 01:01:16.643
Tomorrow. I'm just letting Ash
know I'm ready.

01:01:16.645 --> 01:01:18.376
Wait, wait, wait, Sean.

01:01:18.378 --> 01:01:21.743
You know, you've been
given leave for a reason,

01:01:21.745 --> 01:01:27.077
so I think you should take
that time and get some rest.

01:01:27.079 --> 01:01:28.575
I've taken time.
I've rested,

01:01:28.577 --> 01:01:30.244
and now I'm ready
to come back to work.

01:01:30.246 --> 01:01:31.575
Well, you took like four days.

01:01:31.577 --> 01:01:33.809
I'm a doer, Susan.
You know this.

01:01:33.811 --> 01:01:36.810
And to be honest, I feel like
the time off is the problem.

01:01:36.812 --> 01:01:38.512
I don't think
it's good for me.

01:01:40.345 --> 01:01:41.475
Hey...

01:01:41.477 --> 01:01:43.244
will you do me a favor?

01:01:43.246 --> 01:01:46.713
Will you just, um,
take one more week.

01:01:48.644 --> 01:01:50.678
Okay? Can you do that for me?

01:01:54.511 --> 01:01:55.809
No.

01:01:55.811 --> 01:01:58.312
Wait, Sean.

01:02:00.778 --> 01:02:02.109
Hey, Monica!

01:02:02.111 --> 01:02:03.343
Hey, you're back.

01:02:03.345 --> 01:02:05.743
- I'm back.
- Awesome.

01:02:05.745 --> 01:02:07.710
- Braylen.
- You're back?

01:02:07.712 --> 01:02:10.110
I'm back.

01:02:10.112 --> 01:02:11.313
So back.

01:02:13.512 --> 01:02:15.776
- Hey, you're back.
- Yeah.

01:02:15.778 --> 01:02:17.511
- Hey, Sean.
- Hey.

01:02:25.111 --> 01:02:27.445
Sean, how are you?

01:02:29.245 --> 01:02:30.276
Ah!

01:02:30.278 --> 01:02:31.709
Sensational, yeah.

01:02:31.711 --> 01:02:34.543
This time is for you to rest.

01:02:34.545 --> 01:02:36.777
Yes, yes,
and the last four days

01:02:36.779 --> 01:02:39.177
have really helped me
to figure stuff out,

01:02:39.179 --> 01:02:41.409
and now I am fighting-fit.

01:02:41.411 --> 01:02:43.079
I'm ready
to come back to work.

01:02:45.211 --> 01:02:48.110
- We have a brand to protect.
- Sure.

01:02:48.112 --> 01:02:49.409
The weather is important.

01:02:49.411 --> 01:02:51.410
You're preaching to the choir.

01:02:51.412 --> 01:02:53.043
They wanna feel like
they're in safe hands.

01:02:53.045 --> 01:02:54.176
Yes.

01:02:56.079 --> 01:02:58.212
<i>The hot, dry gusts...</i>

01:03:00.212 --> 01:03:01.810
Hmm?

01:03:01.812 --> 01:03:04.510
You want me
to watch it with you?

01:03:04.512 --> 01:03:05.710
Yeah.

01:03:05.712 --> 01:03:07.245
Okay.

01:03:13.812 --> 01:03:15.810
<i>The hot gu...</i>

01:03:19.745 --> 01:03:22.542
Yup, I think we're good.

01:03:22.544 --> 01:03:23.809
Children watch our show.

01:03:23.811 --> 01:03:26.110
Children cry all the time.

01:03:26.112 --> 01:03:27.809
We haven't even gone viral.

01:03:27.811 --> 01:03:31.310
So far, you're only at
112,753 views.

01:03:31.312 --> 01:03:34.109
That's a lot. I mean,
it's only been four days.

01:03:34.111 --> 01:03:35.309
Exactly.

01:03:35.311 --> 01:03:37.676
So go home and rest.

01:03:37.678 --> 01:03:39.777
Just let the dust settle.

01:03:39.779 --> 01:03:42.676
I can't!

01:03:42.678 --> 01:03:45.113
Please.

01:03:48.311 --> 01:03:50.409
Oh, I'm sorry.
I gotta take this.

01:03:50.411 --> 01:03:51.410
It's Washington.

01:03:51.412 --> 01:03:53.244
Oh, it's the president?

01:03:53.246 --> 01:03:55.542
Someone who lives
in Washington.

01:03:55.544 --> 01:03:58.443
It's Ash.

01:03:58.445 --> 01:03:59.446
Hey!

01:04:02.112 --> 01:04:04.043
Uh-huh, yes.

01:04:04.045 --> 01:04:06.643
No, no, no,
I can talk, I can talk.

01:04:06.645 --> 01:04:10.209
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah.

01:04:10.211 --> 01:04:12.509
Close it. Thank you.

01:05:22.812 --> 01:05:25.610
Ernesto, Ernesto...

01:05:25.612 --> 01:05:26.712
Sí, yeah, do you know him?

01:05:28.046 --> 01:05:29.245
No.

01:05:31.812 --> 01:05:33.410
This is Ernesto.

01:05:33.412 --> 01:05:36.675
Ernesto.
Do you know him, guys?

01:05:36.677 --> 01:05:38.709
Hey, I see you smiling.
You remember me.

01:05:38.711 --> 01:05:40.243
You know Ernesto.

01:05:40.245 --> 01:05:42.710
Oh, come on, amigo.
I know you know Ernesto.

01:05:42.712 --> 01:05:45.609
I saw you getting out of the
truck with him a few days back.

01:05:45.611 --> 01:05:48.376
Guys, guys, it's importante.

01:05:48.378 --> 01:05:50.443
I badly need to get in touch
with Ernesto.

01:05:50.445 --> 01:05:52.543
Hey, I can paint.
You need a painter?

01:05:52.545 --> 01:05:54.376
You remember me.
You know Ernesto.

01:05:54.378 --> 01:05:56.376
Y yo sé remar, ¿eh?

01:05:57.677 --> 01:06:00.110
What did he say?
What are you guys saying?

01:06:00.112 --> 01:06:01.543
He says he can row a boat.

01:06:01.545 --> 01:06:03.410
Hey, you wanna hire me?

01:06:03.412 --> 01:06:05.046
We can take a hike.

01:06:08.779 --> 01:06:11.576
Please help me find Ernesto.

01:06:11.578 --> 01:06:12.809
Please.

01:06:12.811 --> 01:06:15.979
It's not trouble, okay?
I promise.

01:06:21.078 --> 01:06:23.675
<i>We're sorry.</i>

01:06:23.677 --> 01:06:25.810
<i>You have reached a number
that's been disconnected</i>

01:06:25.812 --> 01:06:28.109
<i>or is no longer in service.</i>

01:06:28.111 --> 01:06:30.809
<i>If you feel you have reached
this recording in error,</i>

01:06:30.811 --> 01:06:32.679
<i>please check the number
and try your call again.</i>

01:06:36.577 --> 01:06:39.242
<i>We're sorry.</i>

01:06:39.244 --> 01:06:41.575
<i>You have reached a number
that's been disconnected.</i>

01:06:43.811 --> 01:06:45.209
Hey, Gloria!

01:06:45.211 --> 01:06:48.175
<i>Hey, Sean.
How are you?</i>

01:06:48.177 --> 01:06:50.309
I'm fine. How are you?

01:06:50.311 --> 01:06:52.143
<i>I'm good.</i>

01:06:52.145 --> 01:06:54.043
<i>Good to hear from you.</i>

01:06:54.045 --> 01:06:55.643
- Yeah, you too.
- <i>What's up?</i>

01:06:55.645 --> 01:06:59.309
Well, I just dialed Carlos'
cell phone number,

01:06:59.311 --> 01:07:02.676
and it says
it's out of service.

01:07:02.678 --> 01:07:05.810
<i>Why did you call the number?</i>

01:07:05.812 --> 01:07:09.609
I mean, it was... It was one of
those butt dials, you know?

01:07:09.611 --> 01:07:12.043
<i>Okay.</i>

01:07:12.045 --> 01:07:14.510
- <i>Are you good, Sean?</i>
- Yeah, I'm good.

01:07:14.512 --> 01:07:17.142
I was wondering what's going on
with Carlos' cell phone number

01:07:17.144 --> 01:07:19.742
'cause it sounded like
it'd been disconnected.

01:07:19.744 --> 01:07:22.245
<i>It was disconnected.</i>

01:07:25.278 --> 01:07:26.710
What?

01:07:26.712 --> 01:07:29.143
<i>We stopped the bill payment.</i>

01:07:29.145 --> 01:07:32.212
Why? Why would you do...
I don't understand why you...

01:07:34.477 --> 01:07:36.609
<i>Because Carlos is dead.</i>

01:07:36.611 --> 01:07:40.109
<i>He's been dead for six months.
He's gone.</i>

01:07:40.111 --> 01:07:43.076
- Was it the money?
- <i>What?</i>

01:07:43.078 --> 01:07:44.610
I would've paid.
I would've paid the bill.

01:07:44.612 --> 01:07:47.546
- Carlos' phone bill.
- <i>It wasn't the money.</i>

01:07:50.477 --> 01:07:52.076
<i>Are you okay, Sean?</i>

01:07:52.078 --> 01:07:55.411
Yes! I'm fine, I'm fine!
I just...

01:07:58.411 --> 01:08:00.409
I have to go, okay?
I have to go.

01:08:00.411 --> 01:08:02.409
It was great to hear from you.

01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:04.309
I'll call you soon, okay?

01:08:04.311 --> 01:08:05.443
<i>Okay, Sean.</i>

01:08:05.445 --> 01:08:06.612
Okay.

01:08:30.277 --> 01:08:32.309
Last time I was here,
a massive seagull

01:08:32.310 --> 01:08:34.207
just shit on my arm.

01:08:34.210 --> 01:08:36.643
Splat, caca.

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:38.746
Can you imagine
shitting on someone's arm?

01:08:44.178 --> 01:08:47.176
<i>Because the painting,
it's more than one day.</i>

01:08:47.178 --> 01:08:50.042
<i>You said it.
Es más que un día.</i>

01:08:50.044 --> 01:08:52.042
Feel that wind?

01:08:52.045 --> 01:08:53.379
Whoo!

01:10:26.745 --> 01:10:28.178
All right.

01:10:43.778 --> 01:10:45.176
Hey, what's up?

01:10:45.178 --> 01:10:46.175
Hey.

01:10:46.177 --> 01:10:48.142
You're fast.

01:10:48.144 --> 01:10:49.176
You're wet.

01:10:49.178 --> 01:10:52.509
Yeah, I just showered, so...

01:10:52.511 --> 01:10:54.079
Come on in.

01:10:59.110 --> 01:11:01.642
Wow. Sick view up here.

01:11:01.644 --> 01:11:03.675
Oh, thank you, thank you.

01:11:03.677 --> 01:11:05.543
Can I get you a drink?

01:11:05.545 --> 01:11:07.342
No. It's a little early
for me.

01:11:07.344 --> 01:11:10.142
Oh, yeah, no, of course.

01:11:10.144 --> 01:11:14.809
I meant iced tea or soda.

01:11:14.811 --> 01:11:16.208
No, thank you.

01:11:16.210 --> 01:11:17.279
No?

01:11:18.779 --> 01:11:21.475
Guess you didn't have far
to travel.

01:11:21.477 --> 01:11:23.476
No, I'm downtown.

01:11:23.478 --> 01:11:25.576
What do you do down there?

01:11:25.578 --> 01:11:27.276
I'm a nurse.

01:11:27.278 --> 01:11:29.409
A nurse?
That's a nice job.

01:11:29.411 --> 01:11:31.143
Oh, shit! Fuck!

01:11:31.145 --> 01:11:32.509
- I'm so sorry.
- You okay?

01:11:32.511 --> 01:11:33.743
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

01:11:33.745 --> 01:11:36.742
I just keep smashing glasses
today.

01:11:36.744 --> 01:11:38.810
- It's my second one.
- Yeah?

01:11:38.812 --> 01:11:40.777
Let me just clean this up.
You look great, by the way.

01:11:40.779 --> 01:11:42.476
It's nothing to do with that.

01:11:42.478 --> 01:11:44.609
Clean that up later.
Let me help you out, actually.

01:11:44.611 --> 01:11:46.142
No! There's splinters!

01:11:46.144 --> 01:11:48.111
Don't come in here
in your... socks.

01:11:49.811 --> 01:11:51.208
Okay.

01:11:51.210 --> 01:11:53.542
All better.

01:11:53.544 --> 01:11:55.543
Tell me about yourself.

01:11:55.545 --> 01:11:58.108
Are you okay there, buddy?

01:11:58.110 --> 01:11:59.308
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

01:11:59.310 --> 01:12:00.676
It's just...

01:12:00.678 --> 01:12:02.609
You have blood
all over your hands

01:12:02.611 --> 01:12:04.776
and like literally
all over your face.

01:12:04.778 --> 01:12:06.777
- Oh, my God, fuck.
- Your hands are shaking.

01:12:06.779 --> 01:12:08.578
No, no, I don't think so.

01:12:10.244 --> 01:12:11.211
There we go.

01:12:12.278 --> 01:12:14.979
All set.

01:12:16.645 --> 01:12:18.676
- Have you been drinking?
- No! No!

01:12:18.678 --> 01:12:20.111
What?

01:12:22.245 --> 01:12:23.576
I mean, a little.

01:12:23.578 --> 01:12:27.042
Things have been somewhat nutty
for me recently.

01:12:27.044 --> 01:12:30.375
Can we just talk
for a little bit?

01:12:30.377 --> 01:12:32.342
Yeah. What do you want
to talk about?

01:12:32.344 --> 01:12:36.176
I don't know. You know you wanna
just maybe put on some pants

01:12:36.178 --> 01:12:38.343
so we can talk?

01:12:38.345 --> 01:12:39.312
Yeah.

01:12:45.811 --> 01:12:47.979
Dude, are you okay?

01:12:51.611 --> 01:12:53.078
Uh...

01:12:54.577 --> 01:12:57.109
I just, uh...

01:12:57.111 --> 01:13:00.276
I have to brush my teeth
really quick. Be right back.

01:13:00.278 --> 01:13:02.479
Yeah, no, it's fine.

01:13:10.711 --> 01:13:13.410
I took my clothes off because
I assumed that we were...

01:13:13.412 --> 01:13:16.409
Oh, no, I know, I just...

01:13:16.411 --> 01:13:17.742
Give me one second.

01:13:17.744 --> 01:13:18.978
Yeah.

01:13:20.577 --> 01:13:21.809
I don't know what happened,

01:13:21.811 --> 01:13:23.643
but my profile picture
is accurate,

01:13:23.645 --> 01:13:25.243
and I didn't misrepresent
myself.

01:13:25.245 --> 01:13:27.076
No, no, my God,
you didn't.

01:13:27.078 --> 01:13:30.342
It's not you.
It's my issue. I just...

01:13:30.344 --> 01:13:32.343
I'm looking for someone...

01:13:32.345 --> 01:13:33.409
Younger, yeah.

01:13:33.411 --> 01:13:34.510
No! Oh, my God.

01:13:34.512 --> 01:13:36.346
If anything, the other way.

01:13:40.378 --> 01:13:43.075
I guess...

01:13:43.077 --> 01:13:47.545
I'm just looking for someone who
looks like a specific person.

01:13:51.045 --> 01:13:51.979
Huh.

01:13:53.412 --> 01:13:55.509
Look, I have wasted
a lot of time

01:13:55.511 --> 01:13:58.509
trying to find someone
to fix something

01:13:58.511 --> 01:14:00.208
that was broken inside of me.

01:14:00.210 --> 01:14:01.542
Are you hungry?

01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:04.775
- No, thank you.
- Let's hang out.

01:14:04.777 --> 01:14:07.675
Just stay for a while.
I can make you some food.

01:14:07.677 --> 01:14:10.309
You need lunch,
and I'm an idiot.

01:14:10.311 --> 01:14:13.546
No, you're not an idiot,
and neither am I, okay?

01:14:15.712 --> 01:14:18.412
No one else can
make you happy, Sean.

01:14:22.045 --> 01:14:23.144
Stay.

01:14:25.377 --> 01:14:27.012
Have a good day.

01:14:58.577 --> 01:15:00.776
Motherfucker.

01:15:00.778 --> 01:15:02.446
You fucker.

01:15:22.810 --> 01:15:24.808
Excuse me.

01:15:24.810 --> 01:15:27.808
Hi. Where is everyone?
You know, the men.

01:15:27.810 --> 01:15:30.478
Dude, it's Labor Day.

01:15:34.277 --> 01:15:35.545
Thank you!

01:15:38.144 --> 01:15:42.543
<i>Here's what I found
for directions to Pico Rivera.</i>

01:15:42.545 --> 01:15:46.442

01:15:50.244 --> 01:15:52.809

<i>As of 2010,</i>

01:15:54.544 --> 01:15:59.741
<i>the population of Pico Rivera

01:15:59.743 --> 01:16:01.443

Excuse me!

01:16:07.477 --> 01:16:08.642
Hola!

01:16:08.644 --> 01:16:10.176
Hola.

01:16:10.178 --> 01:16:12.175
Does a man named Ernesto
live near here?

01:16:12.177 --> 01:16:13.343
He's about five-eight.

01:16:13.345 --> 01:16:15.176
You don't know?

01:16:15.178 --> 01:16:16.212
Okay, gracias.

01:16:28.710 --> 01:16:29.979
Man.

01:16:37.077 --> 01:16:38.108
Hola.

01:16:38.110 --> 01:16:39.808
Uh, have you seen this guy?

01:16:39.810 --> 01:16:41.742
Who is it, John Connor?

01:16:41.744 --> 01:16:44.476
Hey, man, look, whoever it is,
it's not my business.

01:16:44.478 --> 01:16:46.608
No, it's not trouble, okay?

01:16:46.610 --> 01:16:49.209
He's a friend of mine.
Ernesto is a guy I know.

01:16:49.211 --> 01:16:51.675
A guy I made a pretty strong
connection with,

01:16:51.677 --> 01:16:53.641
and I'm just hoping
to find him.

01:16:53.643 --> 01:16:55.675
And you're asking me
because...

01:16:55.677 --> 01:16:57.143
I miss him.

01:16:57.145 --> 01:16:58.809
Naw, man.
Why would I know him?

01:16:58.811 --> 01:17:01.343
Well, he lives in
this part of Pico Rivera,

01:17:01.345 --> 01:17:02.741
so I thought maybe...

01:17:02.743 --> 01:17:04.510
You know how many Ernestos are
in Pico Rivera?

01:17:04.512 --> 01:17:06.145
Yeah.

01:17:08.811 --> 01:17:10.312
Let me see, man.

01:17:12.478 --> 01:17:14.279
No. Never seen him.

01:17:35.744 --> 01:17:37.410
<i>Okay, I found this
on the web</i>

01:17:37.412 --> 01:17:40.112

01:17:46.278 --> 01:17:47.479
No!

01:18:12.644 --> 01:18:14.446
Oh, you fucker.

01:18:19.178 --> 01:18:21.808
Hey, go the fuck home, hipster.

01:18:21.810 --> 01:18:23.446
¡Chíngate!

01:18:55.344 --> 01:18:58.378
A beer, a shot,
and some ice, please.

01:19:11.345 --> 01:19:13.245
Some ice, please.

01:20:25.644 --> 01:20:29.109
Hey!

01:20:29.111 --> 01:20:30.279
Hey!

01:22:01.211 --> 01:22:02.441
No, no!

01:22:02.443 --> 01:22:04.776
No further, no further.

01:22:04.778 --> 01:22:05.808
We're amigos.

01:22:07.643 --> 01:22:09.212
We're amigos, right?

01:22:12.343 --> 01:22:14.776
I just wanted...

01:22:14.778 --> 01:22:18.478
How do you say "coyote"
in Spanish?

01:22:23.376 --> 01:22:26.143
Oh, come on! Somebody!

01:22:26.145 --> 01:22:29.475
Como se dice "coyote"
en español?

01:22:29.477 --> 01:22:30.742
Coyote.

01:22:30.744 --> 01:22:31.678
Coyote?

01:22:33.309 --> 01:22:35.079
That's interesting.

01:22:36.476 --> 01:22:40.275
Do you hear coyotes here
at night?

01:22:40.277 --> 01:22:44.076
You know, like "aroo!"

01:22:44.078 --> 01:22:47.475
Yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!

01:22:47.477 --> 01:22:50.076
'Cause in the evenings
up where I am,

01:22:50.078 --> 01:22:52.511
I hear coyotes every night.

01:22:54.577 --> 01:22:56.442
And when there was two of us
up there, Ernesto,

01:22:56.444 --> 01:22:58.243
I used to love that sound.

01:23:00.643 --> 01:23:03.709
Carlos and I
would sit out on the deck,

01:23:03.711 --> 01:23:08.307
and that sound
just made me... shiver.

01:23:08.309 --> 01:23:12.043
But in a good way.

01:23:12.045 --> 01:23:14.641
But these days,
when I hear 'em,

01:23:14.643 --> 01:23:19.109
all I hear is just
lonely animals crying out.

01:23:19.111 --> 01:23:21.776
And the dogs in the neighborhood
barking back,

01:23:21.778 --> 01:23:25.241
all they're saying is
that beneath all the fetching

01:23:25.243 --> 01:23:27.441
and the rolling over
and giving the paw,

01:23:27.443 --> 01:23:29.712
they're just as lonely!

01:23:32.144 --> 01:23:34.545
They're just lonely dogs,
Ernesto.

01:23:41.777 --> 01:23:43.709
They're just so lonely.

01:23:43.711 --> 01:23:47.375
And it was making me loco.

01:23:47.377 --> 01:23:49.475
And, uh...

01:23:49.477 --> 01:23:52.241
I wanted you to know.
Whoa!

01:23:57.611 --> 01:23:59.445
Hey! Hey! No!

01:24:02.309 --> 01:24:04.474
I can walk! I'm fine!
Don't...

01:24:04.476 --> 01:24:08.078
Uh... ambulamo.

01:24:09.810 --> 01:24:12.210
Órale, güey.
Vente para acá, mira.

01:24:16.710 --> 01:24:19.310
A ver,
las piernas en la cama.

01:28:36.377 --> 01:28:39.275
<i>"Dear Ernesto,</i>

01:28:39.277 --> 01:28:42.575
<i>I am so ashamed
to have crashed your party.</i>

01:28:42.577 --> 01:28:46.041
<i>I have to try to explain.</i>

01:28:46.043 --> 01:28:49.042
<i>You have a kind face, Ernesto.</i>

01:28:49.044 --> 01:28:51.041
<i>So kind.</i>

01:28:51.043 --> 01:28:52.475
<i>I met you when I was broken,</i>

01:28:52.477 --> 01:28:55.442
<i>and I took advantage
of your kindness.</i>

01:28:55.444 --> 01:28:58.242
<i>But I know now
that it takes time.</i>

01:28:58.244 --> 01:29:00.075
<i>So no more shortcuts.</i>

01:29:00.077 --> 01:29:01.775
<i>I'm going back to the start.</i>

01:29:01.777 --> 01:29:04.375
<i>I'm gonna try to fix myself.</i>

01:29:04.377 --> 01:29:06.374
<i>Just like the deck,
it's more than one day.</i>

01:29:06.376 --> 01:29:08.078
<i>Remember?</i>

01:29:09.411 --> 01:29:12.809
<i>Thank you for listening.</i>

01:29:12.811 --> 01:29:15.044
<i>I won't bother you again."</i>

01:29:32.277 --> 01:29:34.375
97 in Riverside.

01:29:34.377 --> 01:29:37.675
Staying in the lower 80s
in Malibu, Santa Monica.

01:29:37.677 --> 01:29:40.575
As we look ahead to the weekend,
upper 80s, Saturday and Sunday,

01:29:40.577 --> 01:29:42.108
and then that will continue

01:29:42.110 --> 01:29:44.807
with more warm weather
through next week.

01:29:44.809 --> 01:29:50.807
Finally... and I'm gonna go
a little off-piste here...

01:29:50.809 --> 01:29:53.174
I'd like to take
this opportunity

01:29:53.176 --> 01:29:55.208
to tell you, my friends,

01:29:55.210 --> 01:29:59.074
that this will be my final
weather report for KPCK.

01:29:59.076 --> 01:30:00.808
I've had a wonderful time
on this job

01:30:00.810 --> 01:30:06.075
and met a ton of great people
on the streets of Los Angeles.

01:30:06.077 --> 01:30:08.042
But people change.

01:30:08.044 --> 01:30:10.041
Like the weather.

01:30:10.043 --> 01:30:14.074
Now all that remains is for me
to offer gratitude to you all

01:30:14.076 --> 01:30:17.774
and to wish you happy times
in the sunshine.

01:30:17.776 --> 01:30:19.808
Well, good luck, Sean.

01:30:19.810 --> 01:30:22.574
A two-ton truck of avocados

01:30:22.576 --> 01:30:24.509
overturned
on the northbound 405...

01:30:24.511 --> 01:30:26.609
Don't go!

01:30:26.611 --> 01:30:29.442
Ah! Thank you.

01:30:29.444 --> 01:30:31.408
Holy guacamole!

01:30:31.410 --> 01:30:33.575
That's gonna put a dent
on your travel time...

01:30:39.443 --> 01:30:41.011
Okay.

01:30:48.477 --> 01:30:51.011
Here it is, officially.

01:30:54.410 --> 01:30:56.344
Is it the weather?

01:30:57.576 --> 01:31:01.107
Do you hate it here, Sean?

01:31:01.109 --> 01:31:03.442
'Cause I gotta tell ya,

01:31:03.444 --> 01:31:05.377
I really fuckin' love it.

01:31:07.044 --> 01:31:09.078
I love it here too.

01:31:11.277 --> 01:31:14.978
This place is like
a dream to me.

01:31:19.644 --> 01:31:20.711
Bye, Ash.

01:31:24.810 --> 01:31:26.445
Bye.

01:31:53.577 --> 01:31:55.441
Hi there, young man,
you okay?

01:31:55.443 --> 01:31:57.078
You know my dad?

01:32:03.243 --> 01:32:06.341
- Um, why are you guys here?
- My dad wanted to.

01:32:06.343 --> 01:32:08.977
We tried before.
House was always empty.

01:32:11.243 --> 01:32:12.310
Come on in.

01:32:42.310 --> 01:32:46.278
No, no, no, no.
You don't have to do this, okay?

01:32:54.410 --> 01:32:58.542
He spent the last $200 you left
for him with the letter.

01:32:58.544 --> 01:33:01.075
Yeah, no,
that wasn't for this.

01:33:01.077 --> 01:33:03.108
That was for...

01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:06.208
room and board.

01:33:06.210 --> 01:33:07.774
Will you tell him?

01:33:07.776 --> 01:33:13.375
No era para eso.
Era para habitación y comida.

01:33:19.543 --> 01:33:22.676
He wants to know
if you still hear the coyotes.

01:33:27.742 --> 01:33:29.808
Tell him not as much.

01:33:29.810 --> 01:33:32.144
No mucho.

01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:44.711
Can I?

01:33:56.810 --> 01:33:58.641
¿Música?

01:33:58.643 --> 01:33:59.676
Sí.

01:34:16.410 --> 01:34:18.044
No te pago.

01:34:19.709 --> 01:34:20.711
No pay?

01:34:23.410 --> 01:34:25.075
I'll see you in court.

01:34:28.177 --> 01:34:30.041
