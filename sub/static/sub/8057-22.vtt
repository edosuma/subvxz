WEBVTT

00:01.367 --> 00:03.109
LESLIE: Okay, everyone.
Look in your folders.

00:03.169 --> 00:05.274
You will find information
about Founder's Week.

00:05.338 --> 00:06.874
And before we
start brainstorming,

00:06.939 --> 00:09.079
I just wanna thank Ron
for lending us his cabin.

00:09.142 --> 00:10.416
Lending?

00:10.477 --> 00:12.013
Makes it sound like
I had a choice in the matter.

00:12.078 --> 00:13.682
I never should've
agreed to this

00:13.813 --> 00:15.417
or let you know
that I have a cabin

00:15.482 --> 00:17.291
or gotten to know any of you.

00:17.350 --> 00:18.454
That's the spirit.

00:18.518 --> 00:21.624
Founder's Week is a yearly
celebration of all things Pawnee.

00:21.755 --> 00:24.565
We've got a pie-eating
contest, a giant petting zoo,

00:24.624 --> 00:28.003
and the grand-daddy of them
all, the Founder's Week Parade.

00:28.061 --> 00:29.131
<i>Don't wanna over-hype it,</i>

00:29.229 --> 00:31.937
but our parade makes
the Rose Bowl Parade

00:31.998 --> 00:33.636
look like
a turds-on-wheels convention.

00:34.100 --> 00:35.101
Let's do an exercise.

00:35.168 --> 00:37.512
April, what makes Pawnee
the best city in the world?

00:37.570 --> 00:40.073
Easy. Most murders per capita.

00:40.140 --> 00:42.142
The guillotine
was invented here.

00:42.275 --> 00:44.277
City Hall is run
by the walrus mafia.

00:44.344 --> 00:47.223
Donna, help me out.
What makes Pawnee so great?

00:47.280 --> 00:48.350
Cost of living is cheap.

00:48.415 --> 00:50.053
In about three years,
I will have saved enough

00:50.116 --> 00:51.959
to pay off my
condo in Seattle.

00:52.185 --> 00:53.823
You have a condo in Seattle?

00:53.887 --> 00:55.696
Yes, I like the rain
and the fish markets.

00:55.822 --> 00:57.165
LESLIE: Guys,
we need to focus.

00:57.223 --> 00:59.601
I want this to be the best
Founder's Week ever, okay?

00:59.659 --> 01:01.468
No more distractions.

01:01.594 --> 01:03.437
I'm bored.

01:03.496 --> 01:06.739
Let's go have sex in a tree.
He'll be back in eight minutes.

01:06.866 --> 01:08.607
Why did you have
to bring her here?

01:08.668 --> 01:10.272
I don't really have any
power in this relationship.

01:10.336 --> 01:12.043
I'll think of
ideas in the tree.

01:12.172 --> 01:13.879
MONA-LISA: Anyone's welcome
to join us in the tree!

01:15.000 --> 01:21.074

01:34.894 --> 01:36.237
Really?

01:37.297 --> 01:40.244
Okay. Thank you. Bye.

01:41.634 --> 01:42.806
You Okay?

01:44.003 --> 01:45.004
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:45.071 --> 01:48.814
Good morning, colleagues,
co-workers, friends.

01:48.875 --> 01:52.015
Everyone feeling normal...
Today?

01:52.178 --> 01:54.749
ANDY: <i>Here's what happened. I left
my sweatshirt at Ron's cabin.</i>

01:54.848 --> 01:58.557
When I went back to get it,
I found this in the trash,

01:58.618 --> 02:00.256
positive pregnancy test.

02:00.887 --> 02:02.924
<i>Side note, I accidentally
threw my sweatshirt away.</i>

02:02.989 --> 02:04.559
<i>That's why I was
digging through the trash.</i>

02:04.724 --> 02:06.169
Found that, too. Pretty cool.

02:06.226 --> 02:08.068
<i>So if my science is correct,</i>

02:08.161 --> 02:11.370
<i>one of the five women
who were at the cabin...</i>

02:11.431 --> 02:16.005
<i>Leslie, Donna,
Ann, Mona-Lisa, or April...</i>

02:16.069 --> 02:18.777
ls pregnant! Can't be April.

02:19.339 --> 02:22.650
She would've told me.
That leaves four suspects.

02:23.276 --> 02:25.552
There's only one
man for this job,

02:25.645 --> 02:28.592
Bert Macklin, FBI.

02:28.681 --> 02:30.183
<i>They said I was retired.</i>

02:30.283 --> 02:33.059
<i>They said I was too dangerous for
the Pawnee Police Department.</i>

02:33.353 --> 02:34.661
Turns out they were right...

02:34.988 --> 02:36.433
And wrong.

02:36.589 --> 02:39.900
Macklin, you son of a bitch.

02:41.394 --> 02:43.931
Hello, fellow Pawneeans.
As you know,

02:43.997 --> 02:45.806
the Founder's Week festivities
kick off tomorrow.

02:45.865 --> 02:47.173
Um, one small announcement.

02:47.233 --> 02:49.213
Due to a tragic
misunderstanding,

02:49.269 --> 02:51.215
the prettiest
pig beauty pageant

02:51.271 --> 02:54.548
has been replaced by a pork
rib barbecue competition.

02:55.475 --> 02:56.510
Oh, no.

02:56.576 --> 02:59.523
But on to less grisly news,
thank you for participating

02:59.579 --> 03:01.718
in our special
Founder's Week public forum

03:01.848 --> 03:04.021
led by
Councilwoman Leslie Knope.

03:04.117 --> 03:05.790
(CROWD APPLAUDING)

03:06.452 --> 03:09.592
LESLIE: <i>Thanks to a lot of hard work and
some very dedicated civil servants,</i>

03:09.656 --> 03:12.262
this has been
a banner year for our city.

03:12.325 --> 03:14.805
Obesity and diabetes are down.

03:14.861 --> 03:18.035
Test scores are up. Pawnee
raccoon attacks have decreased.

03:18.131 --> 03:19.906
People can now
suddenly feel safe

03:20.033 --> 03:21.808
in our parks, grocery stores,
and hospitals.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.007
I am very proud of
what we've accomplished.

03:24.270 --> 03:28.309
In fact, this forum is
kind of my victory lap.

03:28.775 --> 03:31.187
I am here today to
ask you one question.

03:31.411 --> 03:35.359
Are you better off now
than you were a year ago?

03:35.582 --> 03:36.959
Who'd like to start? Uh-oh.

03:37.317 --> 03:40.298
Kathryn Pinewood,
Pawnee Restaurant Association.

03:40.787 --> 03:42.357
This town is not better off.

03:42.422 --> 03:44.368
This past year
has been a disaster,

03:44.490 --> 03:46.436
and this government
is hell-bent

03:46.492 --> 03:50.201
on stripping away our most
basic personal freedoms.

03:50.296 --> 03:51.639
Okay, counterpoint.

03:51.698 --> 03:54.804
Ms. Pinewood, I've never
stripped away anyone's freedoms.

03:54.867 --> 03:56.608
I simply stopped a restaurant

03:56.669 --> 04:00.674
<i>from serving an insane SOD-ounce
soda to its customers,</i>

04:00.807 --> 04:02.445
which only made our
citizens healthier.

04:02.508 --> 04:06.217
And frankly, I don't see any of those
citizens standing up and complaining...

04:06.279 --> 04:08.054
(AUDIENCE MURMURING)

04:08.114 --> 04:09.457
Okay. Now, I see them.

04:10.550 --> 04:12.587
Whoa, Darren!
Slow down!

04:12.652 --> 04:15.326
That sweat suit's not for sweating in, okay?
This is crushed velvet.

04:15.388 --> 04:17.560
If you go at more than a brisk
walk, it will fall apart.

04:17.624 --> 04:20.070
This looks dope.
Let's pay for it.

04:20.125 --> 04:21.833
<i>TQM'. Business is booming.</i>

04:21.995 --> 04:23.997
<i>If it keeps up like this, I would
leave the Parks Department</i>

04:24.063 --> 04:27.010
and do Rent A Swag full-time,
maybe even expand.

04:27.066 --> 04:29.637
I could add a baby section over
there, call it Li'l Swaggers.

04:29.702 --> 04:31.978
I could add some old people
stuff, call it Rent A Sag.

04:32.038 --> 04:34.075
Ugh, no.
Old people are gross.

04:34.907 --> 04:36.443
Oh, nice.

04:36.509 --> 04:38.853
Hey, dingdong!
Can I go home?

04:38.911 --> 04:42.791
My tum-tum feels gross,
and also, I hate working.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.729
I guess, but find someone
to cover for you, okay?

04:45.785 --> 04:47.856
'Cause we're really busy right now.
(LAUGHS)

04:47.920 --> 04:50.332
Also, a lawyer guy
called you.

04:50.390 --> 04:54.839
He sounded really sexy on the
phone, and I was very into that.

04:54.894 --> 04:57.135
Like, I was, like,
very into that.

04:57.196 --> 04:58.675
All right, let's set
up some boundaries

04:58.798 --> 05:00.300
on what's cool for
you to say to me, okay?

05:00.366 --> 05:01.811
Okay. I frenched
my cousin one time.

05:01.934 --> 05:03.413
That's gross.

05:03.469 --> 05:04.846
I might still be
in love with him.

05:04.904 --> 05:05.905
Please leave.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.040
All right, bye.

Tom Haverford,
my name is Trevor Nelsson.

05:11.110 --> 05:14.091
I represent a client who would
like to make you an offer.

05:14.147 --> 05:17.128
Babyface heard my demo?
I will accept a record deal.

05:17.450 --> 05:19.361
No, you deeply misunderstand.

05:19.419 --> 05:21.865
My client has taken an
interest in Rent A Swag.

05:21.921 --> 05:24.060
He'd like to know
if you are looking

05:24.190 --> 05:26.363
to sell a controlling
interest in the store. Whoa.

05:26.426 --> 05:28.372
Diddy wants to
buy Rent A Swag?

05:28.428 --> 05:29.532
Not what I said.

05:29.662 --> 05:30.800
This is a lot to process.

05:30.863 --> 05:33.503
Will Diddy be
coming to the meeting?

05:33.633 --> 05:35.738
I'm not at liberty to
tell you who my client is.

05:35.868 --> 05:37.973
It would violate
confidentiality.

05:38.037 --> 05:39.209
I understand.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.511
It's not Diddy.

05:40.573 --> 05:41.779
Got it.

05:46.112 --> 05:47.113
(KNOCK ON WINDOW)

05:51.050 --> 05:53.189
Oh.
Hello, Ann.

05:53.252 --> 05:55.163
Oh, boy.
What do you want, Macklin?

05:55.221 --> 05:57.497
Me? Just observing.

05:57.557 --> 05:59.696
A little something they
taught us down at Quantico.

05:59.759 --> 06:01.966
Well, I guess I'll
get out of your hair.

06:02.095 --> 06:04.302
Wait, there is just
one more question.

06:04.497 --> 06:05.635
Congratulations.

06:05.765 --> 06:06.903
Is that a question?

06:06.966 --> 06:09.207
It's an accusation,
'cause I know your secret.

06:10.169 --> 06:11.307
You're pregnant.

06:11.437 --> 06:12.609
What? I'm not pregnant.

06:12.705 --> 06:16.278
You're not? Damn it. Who is? 'Cause I
found this at Ron Swanson's cabin.

06:16.342 --> 06:17.787
It's a pregnancy test.
Oh, my God.

06:17.844 --> 06:21.291
Someone we know is pregnant? I'm trying
to get pregnant. That's not fair.

06:21.347 --> 06:23.691
I mean, great,
and happy for them,

06:23.816 --> 06:26.194
and congratulations, whatever,
but, ooh, no! Boo!

06:26.252 --> 06:27.424
We have to find
out who this is.

06:27.487 --> 06:30.661
Whoa, I don't think so.
Bert Macklin works alone.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.964
I will buy lunch. You can have
as many burgers as you want.

06:33.126 --> 06:34.537
Welcome to the FBI.

06:36.095 --> 06:39.542
Ms. Pinewood, Leslie's public health
initiative has been a huge success.

06:39.599 --> 06:42.079
Pawnee is no longer the fourth
most obese city in America.

06:42.135 --> 06:43.375
We're now ninth.

06:43.469 --> 06:44.470
CHRIS: Together, as a town,

06:44.537 --> 06:47.711
we lost an amount of weight
equal to 800 pregnant manatees.

06:47.774 --> 06:50.152
A gym opened,
and it stayed in business.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.120
And people
checking into the ER

06:52.178 --> 06:55.091
after ingesting a whole
candy wrapper is down 40%.

06:55.148 --> 06:56.593
But where
will it end?

06:56.649 --> 06:58.595
Now, you wanna rob
our children of fun

06:58.651 --> 07:01.257
by attacking the Sweetums
School Lunch Program,

07:01.354 --> 07:03.493
literally taking
candy from babies.

07:03.556 --> 07:05.729
Those school lunches
are incredibly unhealthy.

07:05.792 --> 07:09.171
You somehow convinced the school
board that napkins are a vegetable.

07:09.228 --> 07:10.639
They're made
from plants.

07:10.730 --> 07:13.404
Stop restricting
our freedoms.

07:13.533 --> 07:14.603

My name is Dewey
from Sanitation.

07:21.908 --> 07:25.253
<i>Ever since you stripped us of our
freedoms by making us hire women,</i>

07:25.311 --> 07:28.520
we've had to turn one of our
bathrooms into a woman's bathroom.

07:28.614 --> 07:30.093
We only have
one bathroom now.

07:30.149 --> 07:31.253
I'm so sorry, Dewey.

07:31.317 --> 07:33.319
That sounds like
a horrible price to pay

07:33.386 --> 07:35.332
for something as
trivial as gender equality.

07:35.421 --> 07:36.695
So you agree.

the Pawnee Lerpiss family.

07:39.225 --> 07:42.570
<i>There was supposed to be a Paunch
Burger in this lot next to my house.</i>

07:42.628 --> 07:44.665
And then, you stripped my freedom
by putting a park there.

07:44.730 --> 07:46.175
Now, if I wanna
start my day off

07:46.299 --> 07:47.744
with a triple-decker
pancake breakfast pizza,

07:47.867 --> 07:49.278
I gotta go to the one
that's 10 minutes away,

07:49.335 --> 07:51.178
and that makes me 20 minutes
late to work every day.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.408
I work at home.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.281
Have you ever considered
not eating that for breakfast?

07:54.340 --> 07:56.183
I'll never consider that.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.687
This feels strangely personal.

07:58.744 --> 08:00.883
<i>Maybe it's because
they're all standing up</i>

08:01.013 --> 08:03.152
saying how much they
hate me as a person.

08:03.950 --> 08:06.521
How many people am
I talking to, Donna?

08:06.586 --> 08:08.623
One or one and a ninth?

08:08.754 --> 08:10.563
Are you asking me
if I'm pregnant?

08:10.656 --> 08:13.068
Oh, interesting.

08:13.125 --> 08:16.470
I don't remember saying anything
about anyone being pregnant.

08:16.562 --> 08:18.838
Are you sure it's not you?

08:18.898 --> 08:21.037
I'm a grown woman with a
good head on her shoulders.

08:21.100 --> 08:22.909
Don't worry about me.

08:22.969 --> 08:26.610
Whoo! This case just
got interesting.

08:26.672 --> 08:29.516
Well, not just. It was pretty
interesting to begin with.

08:29.575 --> 08:33.250
This case just
remained interesting.

08:34.046 --> 08:35.650
Listen, my wife
and I do not feel

08:35.780 --> 08:37.419
that we're better
off than a year ago

08:37.482 --> 08:40.589
because a year ago, this town
was not a horrifying sex den

08:40.653 --> 08:41.927
where people could
put their body parts

08:41.988 --> 08:43.227
anywhere they
want with impunity.

08:43.422 --> 08:47.063
And then, you were elected. And now,
this town is a horrifying sex den

where people can
put their body parts

08:48.661 --> 08:51.039
anywhere they want to with impunity.
Yeah.

If you are referring
to my fight

08:52.632 --> 08:55.408
to teach comprehensive
sex education,

08:55.468 --> 08:57.778
<i>you need to at least
acknowledge the fact</i>

08:57.837 --> 09:00.078
that STDs are down
14% from last year.

09:00.139 --> 09:02.779
And deviant behavior in Pawnee
is up a billion percent!

09:02.842 --> 09:03.946
No, it's... No, it's...

09:04.010 --> 09:07.116

See? See?

09:09.615 --> 09:11.253
They agree. Come on.

09:11.484 --> 09:13.725
I am definitely better off
than I was a year ago,

09:13.786 --> 09:15.424
and it's all thanks
to Leslie Knope.

09:15.488 --> 09:18.025
This woman single-handedly
saved my business.

09:18.090 --> 09:20.229
Thank you, Dennis.
There you go, perfect example.

09:20.293 --> 09:21.670
No need for further
questions on that one.

09:21.727 --> 09:24.503
Oh, I'm sorry.
What is your business, sir?

09:24.564 --> 09:26.441
Oh, I run a pornographic
DVD emporium.

09:26.599 --> 09:30.103
Well, it used to be a quaint,
little movie rental place

09:30.169 --> 09:31.580
with a lot of community value.

09:31.637 --> 09:32.638
Oh, It's much better now.

09:32.772 --> 09:33.773
MAN: Yeah!

09:35.908 --> 09:37.114
Leslie is the best.

09:37.243 --> 09:38.483
No, no, Brandi.

09:38.544 --> 09:39.579
Hello, everyone.

09:39.645 --> 09:40.851
I'm Brandi Maxxxx...

09:40.980 --> 09:42.186
ALL: Hi, Brandi.

09:42.248 --> 09:45.559
Star of such films as <i>The
Incredible Burt Wonderbone,</i>

09:45.618 --> 09:48.292
<i>A Good Guy to Lay Hard,
and Argo.</i>

09:49.221 --> 09:53.260
I had a small part in Argo as well
as the porn version, Our Goo.

09:53.326 --> 09:55.670
I've seen the first 90
seconds. It's thrilling.

09:55.728 --> 09:57.332
BRANDI: If it weren't
for Leslie Knope,

09:57.396 --> 10:00.377
there would be far, far less
pornography in this town.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.380
No, what happened was
there was a misunderstanding,

10:03.436 --> 10:05.438
and I accidentally
got the government involved

10:05.504 --> 10:08.610
in an unseemly business, but I cleared
that up, and everything's fine.

10:08.674 --> 10:11.917
It's not like I'm some kind of
sex-crazed maniac or something.

10:11.978 --> 10:13.480
Leslie, are you pregnant?

10:13.546 --> 10:14.957
Did you or did you not leave

10:15.014 --> 10:17.016
this positive pregnancy test
in a dumpster in the woods?

10:18.818 --> 10:19.819
Hey, everybody.

10:22.655 --> 10:24.328
No.
Really?

10:24.390 --> 10:26.370
Okay. Well,
I'll get out of your hair.

10:26.459 --> 10:27.836
Sorry to interrupt.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.337
ANDY: (WHISPERING)
Was that Brandi Maxxxx?

10:30.763 --> 10:34.905
Investors, I have some very
exciting news about Rent A Swag.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.208
Someone, I'm not saying Diddy,

10:37.269 --> 10:39.112
but I'm not not saying Diddy,

10:39.171 --> 10:42.948
has offered to buy out Rent A
Swag for a buttload of money.

10:43.009 --> 10:44.386
How big a buttload, son?

10:44.443 --> 10:47.720
We would all basically
double our investments.

10:47.780 --> 10:50.283
Are you kidding me?
Sell, baby.

10:50.349 --> 10:51.692
Imagine the kind of
treat-yourself day

10:51.751 --> 10:53.025
we could have
with the profits.

10:53.119 --> 10:56.760
I'm talking pedicures
on pedicures on pedicures.

10:56.822 --> 10:57.892
That is appealing.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.697
If someone is interested
in buying you out,

10:59.825 --> 11:01.566
it means you're
doing something right.

11:01.627 --> 11:05.131
I say you continue to grow,
accumulate power, find this investor,

11:05.197 --> 11:07.507
and buy his business
to teach him a lesson.

11:07.933 --> 11:08.968
April, what do you think?

11:09.035 --> 11:10.105
I thought about this a lot.

11:10.169 --> 11:13.013
I actually think that you should
get a Hello Kitty tattoo.

11:13.072 --> 11:14.642
No, with the store.

11:14.707 --> 11:16.584
Oh, uh, burn it for
the insurance money.

11:16.809 --> 11:18.482
Tom, listen to me, if there's
one thing I've learned...

11:18.544 --> 11:20.114
God, nobody cares, Jerry.
Enough.

11:20.179 --> 11:21.317
Thank you.

11:21.447 --> 11:22.619
I miss you guys.

11:24.116 --> 11:27.529
What a wonderful event. Everyone
is having fun. This is great.

11:27.620 --> 11:29.657
(SIGHS) Chris,
could you just please...

11:29.722 --> 11:31.497
I'm sorry, I was just
trying to cheer you up.

11:31.557 --> 11:32.865
Just hang in there.
Thanks.

11:32.925 --> 11:36.099
All right, if you'll excuse me, I found
out this morning that I am playing

11:36.162 --> 11:38.506
a special role
in this parade.

11:38.564 --> 11:39.941
No spoilers.

11:41.167 --> 11:42.874
Honey, I hate
to state the obvious,

11:43.002 --> 11:44.709
but you chose
a life in politics.

11:44.770 --> 11:46.306
I mean, the more you
actually accomplish,

11:46.372 --> 11:47.942
the more heat
you're gonna draw.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.110
Yeah, I know.

11:49.241 --> 11:50.345
Let's go watch
the parade.

11:50.409 --> 11:51.615
You know you
can't resist a parade.

11:51.744 --> 11:52.984
That's true.

11:53.045 --> 11:54.490
Parades and your butt,

11:54.547 --> 11:55.855
my two vices.
There you go.

11:55.915 --> 11:57.451
Whoa. What are you doing?
(LAUGHS)

11:57.883 --> 12:00.193
My assistant has something
she'd like to show you.

12:00.252 --> 12:01.253
Partner.

12:02.321 --> 12:04.801
Oh, my assistant has something
she'd like to show you, partner.

12:05.257 --> 12:06.964
It's a positive
pregnancy test, Tom.

12:07.026 --> 12:08.300
I found it outside
of Ron's cabin

12:08.360 --> 12:09.600
after our
brainstorming session.

12:09.662 --> 12:12.609
Is there any possibility
Mona-Lisa could be pregnant?

12:13.099 --> 12:14.942
We always use protection...

12:15.000 --> 12:17.378
(SIGHS) But I'm pretty positive
she pokes holes in them.

12:17.436 --> 12:18.915
What brand
pregnancy test is it?

12:18.971 --> 12:20.348
It's called
Womb There It ls.

12:20.473 --> 12:21.850
That's her brand.

12:23.242 --> 12:24.880
I'm gonna be a dad?

12:24.944 --> 12:27.754
I'm gonna have a baby
with Jean-Ralphio's sister?

12:27.880 --> 12:31.327
Oh, God. What have I done?
Like, to humanity?

12:31.784 --> 12:33.695
(BAND PLAYING UPBEAT MUSIC)

12:33.753 --> 12:35.824
(CROWD CHEERING)

12:37.723 --> 12:40.226
This is the perfect thing to
take my mind off of yesterday.

12:40.292 --> 12:43.535
I am going to pretend
that this is my victory parade

12:43.596 --> 12:45.701
and the town is celebrating
my hard work and dedication.

12:45.765 --> 12:46.766
There you go.
(LAUGHS)

12:46.832 --> 12:49.438
Leslie, Leslie. I'm so sorry.
I need to talk to you.

12:49.502 --> 12:52.142
What are... What?

12:52.204 --> 12:53.444
I'm the Nipple King.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.452
Kernston's Rubber
Nipple Company

12:55.508 --> 12:57.010
elects a Nipple King
and a Nipple Queen

12:57.143 --> 12:58.645
every year to
ride on the float.

12:58.711 --> 13:00.588
Congratulations, Chris.
Thank you.

13:00.646 --> 13:01.681
It's such an amazing honor.

13:01.747 --> 13:02.748
It's wonderful.

13:02.815 --> 13:05.489
But I do need to talk to you about
a float that is in this parade,

13:05.551 --> 13:06.689
because I'm not sure
that you're going to be...

13:06.752 --> 13:08.698
LESLIE: (ON RECORDING)
No fun for you! Uh-oh.

13:08.754 --> 13:10.290
<i>No fun for you!</i>

13:10.356 --> 13:12.199
LESLIE: Is that me?

13:12.258 --> 13:13.328
BEN: Maybe it's not you.

13:13.392 --> 13:15.303
Maybe it's Kate Upton.
Aw, thank you.

13:15.361 --> 13:17.864
No, it's me, and damn them.
No fun for you!

13:17.930 --> 13:21.104
Hey! Hey, stop, please!

13:21.167 --> 13:22.737
Stop! Excuse me, Pawnee.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.510
I'm sorry, I don't mean to
stop your parade or anything,

13:25.571 --> 13:27.676
but I just have to say
something here, okay?

13:27.773 --> 13:29.377
I don't think
this is very fair!

13:29.508 --> 13:31.146
Babe, stop wagging
your finger.

13:31.210 --> 13:33.053
Certain people are
lashing out at me

13:33.179 --> 13:35.056
because of things
that I did this year.

13:35.114 --> 13:37.788
But I am not trying to
stop you from having fun.

13:37.850 --> 13:39.295
I am an extremely fun person.

13:39.351 --> 13:45.768
This float represents a group of over
300 business owners, individuals,

13:45.825 --> 13:50.740
and community leaders who are protesting
unfair government regulation.

13:50.796 --> 13:54.744
We are the Committee
to Recall Leslie Knope.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.508
Let's kick her out of office.

13:57.603 --> 13:59.514
Recall Knope!

13:59.738 --> 14:01.740
ALL: (CHANTING)
Recall Knope!

14:01.841 --> 14:03.514
Recall Knope!

14:03.576 --> 14:04.850
Recall Knope!

14:04.977 --> 14:06.285
Legalize weed!

14:07.012 --> 14:08.582
Recall Knope!

14:11.116 --> 14:12.823
So, I need to
ask you something

14:12.952 --> 14:14.693
and I kinda wish
Jean-Ralphio wasn't here.

14:14.954 --> 14:17.901
Please tell me that
you're dumping my sister,

14:17.957 --> 14:20.870
(LAUGHING) because I will laugh.
I will laugh so much.

14:20.926 --> 14:22.667
Actually,
it may be the opposite.

14:23.062 --> 14:24.473
Is this yours?

14:24.597 --> 14:26.008
No, no.

14:28.234 --> 14:31.078
Yeah. It's mine.

14:32.004 --> 14:33.176
I'm pregnant.

14:33.239 --> 14:34.377
JEAN-RALPHIO:
Lemony Snicket.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.420
Oh, my God, are you serious?

14:36.542 --> 14:38.852
I'm gonna be an uncle? Is that a real thing?
Is that gonna happen?

14:38.911 --> 14:41.187
No, no, that's too much
responsibility for me.

14:41.313 --> 14:42.849
I gotta find another
way out of this.

14:42.915 --> 14:44.622
Well, I wish you told me.

14:44.683 --> 14:46.754
I mean, obviously, we need
to talk about our future.

14:46.819 --> 14:48.992
Maybe I could sell the business,
and we could use the profits

14:49.054 --> 14:50.897
to put a down payment on a house
or something, or... Mmm-hmm.

14:50.956 --> 14:52.765
Psych!
What?

14:52.825 --> 14:54.361
(BOTH LAUGHING)

14:56.095 --> 14:57.870
Look at your stupid face.

14:57.930 --> 14:59.102
JEAN-RALPHIO:
You had a dumdum face.

14:59.231 --> 15:00.437
MONA-LISA:
That was hilarious.

15:00.499 --> 15:03.480
(SINGING)
<i>Oh, that was hilarious</i>

15:03.535 --> 15:07.005
<i>That's hilarious</i>

15:07.206 --> 15:09.186
So you're not pregnant?
This isn't yours?

15:09.241 --> 15:10.311
(BLEEP) no!

15:10.376 --> 15:16.122
Do you know how many different pills
I take, birth control or otherwise?

15:16.181 --> 15:18.991
There is no way that I could be
pregnant with a human baby. Uh-uh.

15:19.051 --> 15:20.894
Thank God. Yes!

15:20.953 --> 15:22.830
Tommy has his life back!
Let's go!

15:22.888 --> 15:25.664
What the hell is wrong with you, man?
That's my sister.

15:25.758 --> 15:30.264
Nah! I'm just kidding, man. She's the worst.
You dodged a bullet, baby.

15:30.329 --> 15:31.967
Congratulations.
TOM: Thanks.

15:32.031 --> 15:33.032
MONA-LISA:
Bad, bad, bad.

15:33.098 --> 15:35.169
Well, Macklin,
it's not Mona-Lisa.

15:35.434 --> 15:37.345
It's not me, it's not Donna,
it's not Leslie.

15:37.403 --> 15:39.110
There was only one other
woman at that cabin.

15:39.171 --> 15:40.809
April?
No, she would've told me.

15:40.873 --> 15:42.875
Besides,
the math doesn't add up

15:43.008 --> 15:45.010
because we only have
sex every single day.

15:45.110 --> 15:48.250
And since she's the only one
that we haven't talked to,

15:48.314 --> 15:50.055
it has to be hers.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.060
Oh, my God.

15:52.484 --> 15:54.225
(CUTLERY SCRAPING ON PLATE)

15:56.388 --> 15:58.197
I don't like
seeing you like this.

15:58.257 --> 15:59.759
I've never felt
this way before.

15:59.858 --> 16:01.132
Maybe I should just quit.

16:01.193 --> 16:04.197
Maybe we should both quit, and
we should move to the Bahamas,

16:04.263 --> 16:07.733
live on a beach, catch
fish with homemade spears.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.007
Yeah, you'd last about
30 seconds without work.

16:10.235 --> 16:11.509
When we went to Hawaii,

16:11.570 --> 16:13.379
you woke me up at 3:00 a.m.
to watch Meet the Press.

16:13.439 --> 16:17.387
Well, it was Elizabeth Warren. Like,
I'm not going to watch that live?

16:17.443 --> 16:19.150
Look, you can hate
your job sometimes.

16:19.278 --> 16:21.019
It's allowed. But let
me ask you this.

16:21.080 --> 16:23.492
Do you think this town is better
off than it was a year ago?

16:23.549 --> 16:24.550
Yes.

16:24.616 --> 16:26.493
Do you stand behind
everything you've done?

16:26.552 --> 16:28.395
Yes.
Then screw 'em.

16:29.888 --> 16:33.495
But even if I wanted to fight
this recall, how would I do it?

16:34.560 --> 16:36.335
Thank you all for coming.

16:36.395 --> 16:37.999
As most of you probably know,

16:38.063 --> 16:40.441
there is a large committee
that has announced plans

16:40.499 --> 16:41.978
to recall me from office.

16:42.034 --> 16:44.014
My response to them is this...

16:45.537 --> 16:49.417
<i>Bring it on. Step up.
Step Up 2: The Streets.</i>

16:49.475 --> 16:51.421
I'm sorry,
my adrenaline is pumping,

16:51.543 --> 16:53.523
so all I can think of
is dance movie titles.

16:53.645 --> 16:55.352
Stomp the <i>Yard.</i> There's one.

16:55.414 --> 16:58.486
Look, I work very hard for
this town, as hard as I can,

16:58.550 --> 17:00.587
and all that matters
to me is whether or not

17:00.652 --> 17:03.223
everyone here thinks
that they are better off now

17:03.288 --> 17:04.892
than they were a year ago.

17:04.957 --> 17:06.060
I think you are.

17:06.125 --> 17:08.263
If you disagree with me,
then go ahead and recall me.

17:08.327 --> 17:10.465
Go crazy. You Got Served.

17:10.729 --> 17:12.970
<i>Silver Linings Playbook,
kind of.</i>

17:13.065 --> 17:14.476
The committee says
they plan to push

17:14.599 --> 17:16.011
for a recall vote
within two months.

17:16.068 --> 17:17.604
Do you have a comment on that?
Nope.

17:17.669 --> 17:20.650
Again, all I really care about
is are you better off?

17:21.006 --> 17:22.644
I think I'm better off.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.186
I haven't had
a date in a while,

17:24.309 --> 17:25.788
but I'm learning
a lot about me.

17:25.844 --> 17:27.186
Well, l wasn't
asking you specifically,

17:27.311 --> 17:28.689
but I'm happy to
hear that, Shauna.

17:28.747 --> 17:32.695
So, in conclusion, recall, shmecall.
(CHUCKLES)

17:32.751 --> 17:34.890
No, I can't end my
big press conference by

17:35.020 --> 17:37.159
saying "recall, shmecall."
That's ridiculous.

17:37.256 --> 17:38.462
Ben, can you help me out here?

17:38.524 --> 17:40.834
That concludes Councilwoman
Knope's press conference.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.634
And if you have any
further questions...

17:42.694 --> 17:43.695
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)

17:43.762 --> 17:46.743
Hold on to them, because she
has a lot of work to do.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.369
<i>Thanks, honey. Honey.</i>

17:48.434 --> 17:50.641
That's another dance movie
with Jessica Alba.

17:52.738 --> 17:53.944
LESLIE: All right, people.

17:54.006 --> 17:55.815
The Pawnee River's
not gonna clean itself.

17:55.874 --> 17:58.354
Volunteer weekend
task force, mobilize.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.788
Oh, Leslie,
this goes without saying,

18:00.913 --> 18:03.325
but if you need any
speeches or testimonials

18:03.382 --> 18:05.191
or just general enthusiasm
for your recall fight,

18:05.250 --> 18:06.251
I'm your man.

18:06.351 --> 18:07.557
Thank you, Chris.
You're welcome.

18:07.653 --> 18:08.927
I'll see you at the river.
Oh, oh, oh!

18:08.987 --> 18:11.092
Last one to pick
up 100 rusty cans

18:11.223 --> 18:13.362
has still accomplished
a great deal.

18:14.059 --> 18:16.767
Hey, maybe after, you wanna come
meet me and Chris for a drink?

18:16.895 --> 18:18.806
Sure. Hey, how's it
going with you guys?

18:18.864 --> 18:21.902
We're great, actually,
and we're having a good time.

18:21.967 --> 18:23.503
Sex is ridiculous.
Mmm-hmm.

18:23.569 --> 18:26.049
Hopefully, that ridiculous sex
will lead to a baby.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.745
(SIGHS) I'm so happy for you.
Just remember to use protection.

18:28.807 --> 18:30.844
Wait, no, don't. That
would defeat the purpose.

18:30.909 --> 18:32.320
Okay, no. Do your thing.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.353
(LAUGHING) Yeah!

18:36.415 --> 18:37.951
My wife is pregnant!

18:38.083 --> 18:39.619
Okay, put me down.

18:39.685 --> 18:40.755
Hey, you can't
keep it from me.

18:40.819 --> 18:41.820
I found
the pregnancy test, honey.

18:41.887 --> 18:45.027
Andy, I'm not pregnant, okay? And if
I were, you shouldn't lift me up.

18:45.424 --> 18:46.926
Wait, are you sure you're not?

18:46.992 --> 18:49.700
Yeah. We've talked
about this. Remember?

18:49.828 --> 18:51.171
I wanna wait until we're 50

18:51.230 --> 18:53.767
and then adopt a set of creepy
adult twins from Romania.

18:53.932 --> 18:55.070
Yeah. Of course.

18:55.267 --> 18:57.144
Actually, there is something
I need to tell you.

18:57.202 --> 18:59.148
(GASPS) You're pregnant.

18:59.204 --> 19:00.478
<i>No.
No!</i>

19:00.539 --> 19:02.246
We just ruled that out.

19:02.307 --> 19:04.184
Dang it.
Okay, a while ago,

19:04.243 --> 19:06.416
I applied to veterinary school
in Bloomington,

19:06.478 --> 19:08.480
and I just found out that...

19:08.547 --> 19:10.026
l got in.

19:10.082 --> 19:12.528
You did? That's amazing!

19:12.584 --> 19:14.154
Wait, why did you
wait to tell me?

19:14.219 --> 19:16.859
Because I don't even know
if I wanna go, okay?

19:16.922 --> 19:19.163
I mean, yes, it's been my
dream to work with animals

19:19.224 --> 19:21.363
since I was a kid
and everything.

19:21.860 --> 19:23.168
But it would mean
I would be spending

19:23.295 --> 19:24.638
a lot of time apart
from you, and... Oh.

19:24.696 --> 19:26.369
We could get through that.

19:26.565 --> 19:28.806
I mean, look.
It would suck for awhile,

19:28.934 --> 19:31.210
and I would miss
you while you're gone.

19:31.270 --> 19:35.514
But as I've known about you
for the past 20 seconds,

19:35.641 --> 19:37.382
this is your dream.

19:38.911 --> 19:40.754
I'm really glad
I married you.

19:40.879 --> 19:42.722
Yeah, we made
a good call on that one.

19:43.715 --> 19:45.388
So I just wanted
to let you know

19:45.450 --> 19:47.088
I will not be
selling Rent A Swag.

19:47.152 --> 19:51.567
And you can go tell your client
he now has 100 problems?

19:51.623 --> 19:53.500
Is it Jay-Z?
No.

19:53.559 --> 19:54.765
But since you're
not taking the deal,

19:54.826 --> 19:57.500
I should inform you that my client
will be moving on to plan B.

19:57.563 --> 20:00.066
Opening his own store directly
across the street from yours.

20:00.165 --> 20:02.236
Across the street? What kind
of store is it gonna be?

20:02.334 --> 20:03.938
He's calling it
Tommy's Closet.

20:04.002 --> 20:07.074
It's a high-end secondhand clothing
store where parents can rent clothes

20:07.139 --> 20:09.016
for their teens,
tweens, and pres,

20:09.074 --> 20:12.055
as well as babies, toddlers,
grown-ups, and olds.

20:12.110 --> 20:13.851
But that's my
idea and my name.

20:13.912 --> 20:16.324
So I guess only Domino's
is allowed to sell pizza now?

20:16.415 --> 20:18.361
It's called capitalism,
Mr. Haverford,

20:18.483 --> 20:20.429
and you are about
to get a free lesson.

20:20.719 --> 20:23.393
Only this free lesson
is going to cost you.

20:24.022 --> 20:25.968
So it's not free?

20:27.359 --> 20:29.270
You're right.
That was confusing.

20:29.962 --> 20:32.067
This lesson will cost you.
Good day.

20:32.264 --> 20:36.178
This sucks, but I have to admit,
it's a pretty baller move.

20:36.835 --> 20:38.246
You sure this isn't Diddy?

20:41.406 --> 20:42.885
It is Diddy.
I knew it!

20:42.941 --> 20:44.420
It's not Diddy.

20:46.712 --> 20:49.955
Are you sure everything will be all
right if April goes to vet school?

20:50.015 --> 20:52.291
There are no sure
things in life, son,

20:52.417 --> 20:54.693
but you two seem
pretty solid to me.

20:54.786 --> 20:56.197
Change is good, I guess.

20:56.321 --> 20:57.766
Not to me.

20:57.823 --> 20:59.598
Leslie's going
around asking everybody

20:59.725 --> 21:01.534
if they're better off
than they were a year ago.

21:02.027 --> 21:04.064
All I care about is
that I'm the same.

21:04.463 --> 21:07.103
If I'm the same as I
was a year ago, I'm happy.

21:07.232 --> 21:08.336
Wait, I forgot.

21:08.734 --> 21:10.611
Who the hell is pregnant?
What?

21:10.669 --> 21:12.171
I found a pregnancy
test at your cabin,

21:12.304 --> 21:13.840
I checked with all
the girls that were there.

21:13.905 --> 21:15.350
It wasn't any of them.

21:16.575 --> 21:18.577
Hello, darling.
What a surprise.

21:18.644 --> 21:22.091
Hey. Can we talk?
Maybe in private?

21:24.016 --> 21:25.154
