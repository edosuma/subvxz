NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

00:03.269 --> 00:06.932
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

00:07.007 --> 00:08.167
In New York City,

00:08.241 --> 00:11.301
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.378 --> 00:14.745
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

00:14.814 --> 00:16.782
These are their stories,

00:17.317 --> 00:18.841
(BELL RINGING)

00:20.253 --> 00:21.379
It's not as serious
as it sounds.

00:21.454 --> 00:24.150
If Kathleen doesn't pull her
grades up, she'II have to
go to summer school.

00:24.224 --> 00:25.782
I find that pretty serious.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.622
We're working on it.
She's making progress.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.559
And why am I now
just hearing about this?

00:29.629 --> 00:30.653
Because you work really hard,

00:30.730 --> 00:33.563
and most nights
you're not home
until the kids are in bed.

00:35.802 --> 00:38.134
Kathleen,
who are you talking to?
A friend.

00:38.204 --> 00:39.193
Get off the phone.
Dad.

00:39.272 --> 00:41.001
Now. Now.

00:41.474 --> 00:42.839
I'II call you back.

00:42.909 --> 00:45.139
It isn't what you think.
I was getting help
on a math assignment.

00:45.211 --> 00:47.202
Hey, I got news for you.
Things are going to change
around here.

00:47.280 --> 00:49.680
No mall, no friends,
no phone until further notice.

00:49.749 --> 00:51.580
That's not fair. Mom?

00:56.022 --> 00:59.981
You know, it is abundantly
clear to me, you are a parent
and I am a paycheck.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.324
You're a good father,
but you're overreacting.

01:02.395 --> 01:03.828
You know, we're pretty Iucky.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.365
We've never had
any real trouble
with the kids.

01:06.433 --> 01:08.162
Trouble's relative.

01:08.234 --> 01:11.260
I heard about a girl today
who was raped by her teacher.

01:11.337 --> 01:14.238
She's scared to death,
refuses to go to the police,

01:14.307 --> 01:15.569
won't even tell her family.

01:15.642 --> 01:17.166
Now that's what
I call trouble.

01:17.243 --> 01:18.335
Who are you talking about?

01:18.411 --> 01:19.571
I don't know her.

01:19.646 --> 01:20.635
She get medical attention?

01:20.713 --> 01:23.773
My friend Carol
at St. Matthew's,
she did a rape kit.

01:23.850 --> 01:27.115
She says she doesn't want
to report it and she's got
to keep it confidential.

01:27.187 --> 01:28.449
She shouldn't have told me.

01:28.521 --> 01:31.081
Carol's bound by Iaw
not to release
any of that information

01:31.157 --> 01:32.181
if that's what
the victim chooses.

01:32.258 --> 01:35.716
Yeah, but that's ridiculous,
'cause the girl's only 14.

01:36.596 --> 01:38.359
Grown women think twice
about reporting it.

01:38.431 --> 01:40.991
After a violation Iike that,
you know, it's tough
to know who to trust.

01:41.067 --> 01:43.661
She should at Ieast
tell her parents.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.803
Maybe they're not around.

01:46.873 --> 01:50.934
Nope. From what I understand,
she comes from a good home
with both parents.

01:52.412 --> 01:57.179
Well, my experience says
Mom and Dad
are the Iast resort.

01:57.417 --> 01:59.282
What school she go to?

02:00.987 --> 02:02.045
Why?

02:04.190 --> 02:07.455
Maybe they have a decent
counselor to help her out.

02:08.862 --> 02:11.888
If this girl doesn't want
to talk to her parents
or the police,

02:11.965 --> 02:14.263
why would
she tell a counselor?

02:14.968 --> 02:18.927
This girl is going to develop
disciplinary problems
or depression.

02:19.405 --> 02:21.737
If she's Iucky enough,
the school will have
qualified teachers

02:21.808 --> 02:23.799
to recognize the symptoms.

02:24.511 --> 02:27.309
Well, Tucker Junior High's
got a good reputation,

02:27.380 --> 02:29.245
so I hope you're right.

02:29.315 --> 02:31.408
It's too quiet upstairs.

02:42.629 --> 02:45.189
Hey, EIIiot.
What're you doing here?
Are you on a case?

02:45.265 --> 02:47.460
No. Actually,
I'm here to see you.

02:47.534 --> 02:49.058
What about?

02:49.135 --> 02:51.035
I need her name, Carol.

02:51.604 --> 02:53.765
I can't believe
Kathy broke my confidence.
It wasn't deliberate.

02:53.840 --> 02:54.864
I don't care.

02:54.941 --> 02:57.102
I promise I won't tell anyone
where I got the information.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.577
Look. You know
I can't give it to you.
And even if I did,

02:59.646 --> 03:02.945
you can't do a damn thing
about it without Iosing your
job, and costing me mine.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.711
I'II keep you out of it.

03:04.784 --> 03:07.947
Carol, you have to want
to help this girl. She's 14.
She's been raped.

03:08.021 --> 03:12.355
As far as you're concerned,
Detective Stabler,
this girl doesn't exist.

04:09.816 --> 04:12.444
OIivia, I need a favor.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.079
Okay.

04:14.153 --> 04:15.279
Bear in mind I don't have
any money.

04:15.355 --> 04:17.755
I'm an underpaid
detective, just Iike you.

04:18.725 --> 04:22.286
What I want is risky.

04:22.495 --> 04:24.258
Well, Iet me decide.

04:25.498 --> 04:28.296
I need you to check
an ER sign-in Iog.

04:29.202 --> 04:30.965
Why can't you do it?

04:32.305 --> 04:35.297
A 14-year-old girl
was raped by a teacher.

04:35.375 --> 04:38.674
She got the exam
at the hospital, but she
didn't want to report it.

04:38.745 --> 04:41.942
Kathy knows the nurse
who works there, but if she
sees me snooping around...

04:42.015 --> 04:43.949
She absolutely
is not supposed
to give out that information.

04:44.017 --> 04:46.952
I know. I just got to
make sure that it's real.

04:47.453 --> 04:48.943
And then what?

04:50.423 --> 04:52.618
Convince her to come forward.

04:53.059 --> 04:54.356
Not a good idea, EIIiot.

04:54.427 --> 04:55.485
She's just scared, OIivia.

04:55.561 --> 04:58.530
She's a kid who doesn't know
that there are people out
there who want to help her.

04:58.598 --> 05:01.624
And if she doesn't
want to tell us,
then we can't make her.

05:01.701 --> 05:05.501
So she just sits
in the classroom
being taught by her rapist.

05:07.206 --> 05:08.730
What hospital?

05:09.375 --> 05:11.309
(WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA)

05:11.944 --> 05:14.640
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Can I help you?

05:14.714 --> 05:17.410
OIivia Benson,
Special Victims. I'm here
to interview the rape victim.

05:17.483 --> 05:19.451
We didn't call
any assaults today.
You sure?

05:19.519 --> 05:21.350
I just go where they tell me.

05:21.421 --> 05:22.718
What's the victim's name?

05:22.789 --> 05:24.984
Munch, Margaret K.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.484
No one here by that name.

05:30.430 --> 05:33.422
Okay. Mix-ups happen.
Victims' names get mangled,

05:33.499 --> 05:35.831
which hospitals
they're sent to,
even precinct assignments.

05:35.902 --> 05:37.460
You must see a Iot of victims.

05:37.537 --> 05:40.870
They're traumatized enough.
They don't need
to wait for me.

05:41.407 --> 05:42.465
How can I help you?

05:42.542 --> 05:44.703
Let me take a Iook
at the sign-in sheet
for the past two days,

05:44.777 --> 05:48.679
and I'II call the precinct,
verify the information
I've got.

05:51.284 --> 05:52.478
Thanks.

05:58.324 --> 05:59.689
(BELL RINGING)

06:00.126 --> 06:02.424
You suspect a teacher
of raping one of my students,

06:02.495 --> 06:05.259
but you don't even know
the girl's name?

06:05.631 --> 06:08.259
Are you sure she isn't Iying
to cover something else?

06:08.334 --> 06:12.998
Well, I won't know that
unless I talk to her. She was
probably absent yesterday,

06:13.072 --> 06:16.098
so if I could take a Iook
at the Iist
of absentee students

06:16.175 --> 06:17.301
I think I'II find my victim.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.868
Sounds to me Iike your victim
doesn't want to be found.

06:19.946 --> 06:22.414
And are you comfortable
having a teacher
using his authority

06:22.482 --> 06:24.507
to prey on children
under your responsibility?

06:24.584 --> 06:26.415
That doesn't even
deserve a response.

06:26.486 --> 06:29.614
I give you my word
that I won't approach anyone
until I'm sure I'm right.

06:29.689 --> 06:32.852
I promise that I'II
handle this with discretion.

06:35.795 --> 06:39.094
You're sticking your neck
way out there, aren't you?

06:39.232 --> 06:42.167
Ma'am,
under the circumstances,
wouldn't you?

06:47.006 --> 06:51.466
Okay, here it is.
Cynthia Wilmont.
Signed in at 9:45 a.m.

06:51.544 --> 06:53.944
According to this Iist,
she had a note from home
explaining her absence.

06:54.013 --> 06:57.813
Well, it's got to be
a forgery. I used to do it
all the time. Everyone does.

06:58.918 --> 07:01.751
Except, of course, your kids.
I'm sure that you're
very intimidating.

07:01.821 --> 07:03.618
Yeah, I'm real scary.

07:05.391 --> 07:07.120
Okay, so how do we
play this one out?

07:07.193 --> 07:10.424
I can't Iet you do anything
else. If it hits the fan,
I want you covered.

07:10.496 --> 07:12.054
Well, it's a Iittle Iate
for that, EIIiot.

07:12.131 --> 07:15.066
If anyone goes digging,
they go straight back to me.

07:15.134 --> 07:18.035
I had to show my ID
to get access
to the sign-in sheet.

07:18.104 --> 07:22.006
Well, if we talk to this girl,
I'm going to need
to cover our ass.

07:25.578 --> 07:26.738
Have you Ieft anything out?

07:26.813 --> 07:29.748
No. That's everything.
Our rape victim's an eighth
grader at Tucker Junior High.

07:29.816 --> 07:31.078
Her name is Cynthia Wilmont.

07:31.150 --> 07:34.347
I just didn't
want to pursue it
without talking to you first.

07:34.420 --> 07:36.047
Now that's the first
sensible thing
you've said,

07:36.122 --> 07:37.384
because you're
going to have to drop it.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.481
Captain.

07:38.558 --> 07:42.426
No. You have Ieft the city,
the hospital and yourself
open to a Iawsuit.

07:42.495 --> 07:44.326
We're talking about
a minor here.

07:44.397 --> 07:46.627
Now, there's got to be a way
to circumvent that.

07:46.699 --> 07:50.100
Once you talk to the girl,
she's going to know
the nurse gave her up.

07:50.169 --> 07:51.602
You open that can of worms,

07:51.671 --> 07:54.196
victims advocates
will want your blood,
and I will give it to them.

07:54.273 --> 07:57.242
I'd think they'd be the first
ones who'd want us to
catch this hump.

07:57.310 --> 08:00.074
EIIiot, it's hard enough
to get adult women to report.

08:00.146 --> 08:04.207
If victims feel no confidence,
they won't even go in
for the exam.

08:05.084 --> 08:06.711
Now, you are
going to drop this

08:06.786 --> 08:09.755
until she is ready to come
forward on her own.

08:10.022 --> 08:12.047
It's her teacher, Captain,

08:12.758 --> 08:14.419
and he gets away with this,
he's not going stop.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.952
At the very Ieast, Iet's just
get him out of the school.

08:24.270 --> 08:27.034
You have the victim brought
to the principal's office
for a sit-down.

08:27.106 --> 08:29.836
If she doesn't want to talk,
you back off.

08:30.877 --> 08:31.935
AII right.

08:32.010 --> 08:35.469
And you go
behind my back again,
it goes in your jacket.

08:43.923 --> 08:45.788
I guess you found her.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.849
An eighth grader,
Cynthia Wilmont.

08:48.561 --> 08:53.624
Sheila, can you get
Cynthia Wilmont to come
to my office, please?

08:55.835 --> 08:57.564
We'd also Iike a Iist
of her teachers.

08:57.637 --> 08:59.264
Now, that I can't do.

08:59.772 --> 09:00.830
Unofficially.

09:00.907 --> 09:04.536
You need a subpoena
before I can give you
information about a teacher.

09:04.610 --> 09:07.078
You do know what we're trying
to accomplish here, don't you?

09:07.146 --> 09:09.944
And I applaud your efforts,
but whoever this person is,

09:10.016 --> 09:12.382
he has rights
until he's been accused.

09:12.451 --> 09:14.612
Especially since it's Cynthia.

09:14.687 --> 09:16.951
Have you noticed any change
in her behavior?

09:17.023 --> 09:20.390
She hasn't been brought
to my office on any
disciplinary action.

09:20.459 --> 09:22.654
Other than that,
you'II have to talk
to her teachers,

09:22.728 --> 09:25.492
and that I can't allow
until you have
an actual complaint.

09:25.565 --> 09:30.002
Cynthia Wilmont is Iaying down
in the nurse's office
with a stomach ache.

09:30.703 --> 09:32.227
You might
want to do this Iater.

09:32.305 --> 09:35.502
If she doesn't want
to speak with us, we'II Ieave.

09:39.712 --> 09:42.180
Take the detectives to the
nurse's office

09:42.248 --> 09:44.546
and make sure
they have some privacy.

09:44.617 --> 09:45.811
BENSON: Thanks.

09:47.853 --> 09:49.115
(DOOR OPENS)

09:49.789 --> 09:52.383
SHEILA: These people
need to talk to Cynthia
in private for a minute.

09:52.458 --> 09:54.153
Sure.
We'II be right outside.

09:54.226 --> 09:55.557
Thank you.

09:56.662 --> 10:01.429
Hi, Cynthia.
I'm OIivia Benson
and this is EIIiot Stabler.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.001
You're cops.

10:04.203 --> 10:06.364
You're right. We know
you're not feeling well,

10:06.439 --> 10:07.997
but we were wondering
if, maybe, there was something

10:08.074 --> 10:10.167
that you might Iike
to talk to us about?

10:10.242 --> 10:11.573
CYNTHIA: Like what?

10:11.677 --> 10:14.111
Well, has anyone
been bothering you Iately?

10:14.180 --> 10:15.340
No.

10:15.815 --> 10:17.510
STABLER: Do you Iike
all your teachers?

10:17.583 --> 10:18.811
Why are you asking me that?

10:18.884 --> 10:20.613
BENSON:
Because we want to help you.

10:20.686 --> 10:23.246
Did somebody tell you
that I'm in trouble?

10:23.322 --> 10:24.619
It's not true.

10:27.093 --> 10:32.326
Cynthia, you can tell us
if somebody touched you,
no matter what.

10:33.432 --> 10:35.161
I don't understand.

10:35.568 --> 10:38.435
Did anything bad happen to you
the day before yesterday?

10:38.504 --> 10:39.698
No.

10:39.772 --> 10:41.171
Then why aren't
you feeling well?

10:44.143 --> 10:45.542
Are you going to talk
to my parents?

10:45.611 --> 10:47.169
Absolutely not.

10:47.246 --> 10:50.704
Why should I believe you?
Why should I believe
anything you say?

10:50.783 --> 10:51.875
Because it's true.

10:51.951 --> 10:53.578
Yeah, I've heard that before.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.986
That nurse promised me
that she wouldn't say a word.

10:57.390 --> 11:01.690
No one else knows,
not even my best friend.

11:01.761 --> 11:03.558
So she had to have told you.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.397
She Iied and now so are you.

11:06.465 --> 11:10.731
Cynthia, if you tell us
who did this, we can make sure
he never does it again.

11:10.803 --> 11:13.328
I'm fine. No one
did anything to me.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.233
(BELL RINGING)

11:17.309 --> 11:18.867
She's scared to death.

11:18.944 --> 11:20.411
Got any suggestions?

11:21.080 --> 11:22.775
None that'II make her happy.

11:22.848 --> 11:24.372
We cannot go to her parents.

11:24.450 --> 11:25.781
About my kid,
I'd want to know.

11:25.851 --> 11:27.478
This isn't about you
or her parents.

11:27.553 --> 11:29.578
She's a child
who doesn't know
what she's doing,

11:29.655 --> 11:31.714
and we need her testimony
to go after this bastard,

11:31.791 --> 11:32.849
before he makes a habit of it.

11:32.925 --> 11:35.951
You expect her to come forward
when most women won't.

11:36.028 --> 11:37.928
Either she's a kid,
or she's an adult, EIIiot.

11:37.997 --> 11:39.555
You can't have it both ways.

11:42.635 --> 11:44.000
Hey, Kath.

11:44.070 --> 11:45.469
OIivia.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.735
I'II update the captain.
Nice to see you.

11:50.976 --> 11:52.341
You're angry.

11:52.411 --> 11:55.403
Actually, I'm not,
and that's what scares me.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.582
You know why
I had to pursue this.

12:00.653 --> 12:02.848
I know I Iost
a good friend today.

12:02.922 --> 12:04.787
But you Iost something
much more important,

12:04.857 --> 12:08.020
and either
you don't realize it
or you don't care.

12:08.094 --> 12:10.119
Now you know that's not true.

12:10.196 --> 12:12.221
You played me, EIIiot.

12:12.364 --> 12:13.797
You carried on
that conversation,

12:13.866 --> 12:16.562
drawing information out of me
Iike I was your witness.

12:16.635 --> 12:20.935
You know what happens
to rape victims when they
don't deal with the trauma.

12:21.006 --> 12:26.137
This girl's got drug and
alcohol abuse in her future,
just to dull the pain,

12:26.212 --> 12:28.976
and then comes
the inability to connect,

12:29.048 --> 12:31.949
the promiscuity
because she thinks
she had it coming to her.

12:32.017 --> 12:35.009
Either way, she's screwed
until she gets help.

12:35.721 --> 12:41.216
A teacher is responsible,
and you know I just
can't Iet this slide.

12:43.195 --> 12:47.825
I know you too well for that
but everything has a price,

12:47.900 --> 12:50.460
and I just hope
that you can pay it.

12:54.106 --> 12:58.133
EII, Carol Porter just called
from St. Matthew's.
Cynthia's been admitted.

12:58.210 --> 13:00.940
Somebody tossed her
down a flight of steps.

13:09.155 --> 13:12.647
We're Iooking for a minor,
female. Her name
is Cynthia Wilmont.

13:12.725 --> 13:14.352
Came with multiple injuries
from a fall.

13:14.426 --> 13:17.862
She's in the O.R.,
getting a pin
in a badly broken arm.

13:19.932 --> 13:21.490
You have any idea
how it happened?

13:21.567 --> 13:25.867
I don't have the whole story,
but Cynthia claims
she fell down the stairs.

13:25.938 --> 13:28.429
At school?
Couple of blocks from home.

13:28.507 --> 13:30.566
Good Samaritan found her,
called a bus.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.737
She's got a black eye,
a broken arm
and fractured ribs.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.782
Her injuries
don't sound consistent
with an accident.

13:36.849 --> 13:39.682
Did you go to the school
and question her?

13:39.752 --> 13:40.878
Why do you ask?

13:40.953 --> 13:43.319
Because she blames me,
Detective.

13:43.389 --> 13:45.380
She became agitated
when I entered the exam room.

13:45.457 --> 13:47.152
I was ordered to Ieave
to calm her down.

13:47.226 --> 13:49.990
Carol, I am so sorry
you got caught
in the middle of all this.

13:50.062 --> 13:52.496
That makes me feel
so much better.

13:56.769 --> 13:59.101
You're still pursuing this?
Unofficially.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.196
What else can you tell us?

14:03.175 --> 14:05.735
Look, if it wasn't
an accident, then maybe
our presence at the school

14:05.811 --> 14:09.372
did cause the rapist to panic.
Trying to intimidate her.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.579
I think she's
been raped more than once.

14:12.651 --> 14:14.118
What makes you say that?

14:14.186 --> 14:16.086
She came in
with abdominal pain,

14:16.155 --> 14:19.215
so the doctor was obliged
to do a vaginal exam.

14:19.458 --> 14:22.655
She's got
pelvic inflammatory disease,
caused by gonorrhea.

14:22.728 --> 14:24.787
Did you do an STD screen
with the rape kit?

14:24.864 --> 14:26.889
Sure, but once it moves
to the fallopian tubes,

14:26.966 --> 14:28.058
the test can come up negative.

14:28.133 --> 14:29.896
Well, doesn't it take weeks
to develop PID?

14:29.969 --> 14:31.300
If the gonorrhea
goes untreated.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.304
MAN: Nurse.
Excuse me.

14:34.540 --> 14:37.373
Well, after this beating,
Cynthia's just
going to dig in.

14:37.443 --> 14:39.411
There is no way
she's going to talk to us.

14:39.478 --> 14:41.912
Well, she doesn't
have a choice anymore.

14:41.981 --> 14:45.246
We find out who assaulted her,
we'II find her rapist.

14:45.317 --> 14:48.150
Her parents should be
in the waiting room.

14:49.688 --> 14:53.215
First they call and tell me
my Iittle girl's been hurt.

14:53.592 --> 14:56.993
Then they tell us she has
gonorrhea. I mean,
have you all gone crazy?

14:57.062 --> 15:00.759
Public health has to be
notified to contact anybody
that Cynthia's been with.

15:00.833 --> 15:02.767
My daughter did not
give this to anyone.

15:02.835 --> 15:06.134
Well, she didn't get gonorrhea
from the toilet seat.

15:09.441 --> 15:11.272
STABLER:
Did anyone have a problem
with your daughter?

15:11.343 --> 15:13.868
She get into a fight
with someone recently,
or an argument?

15:13.946 --> 15:14.970
No.

15:16.315 --> 15:18.943
Does your daughter
have any boyfriends?

15:19.018 --> 15:20.042
No.

15:22.621 --> 15:25.715
Where were you and your wife
when this happened?

15:26.392 --> 15:29.555
I was at work.
She was at home. Why?

15:30.996 --> 15:32.896
Just routine questions.

15:32.998 --> 15:36.263
STABLER: Does Cynthia
have any close friends
we could talk to?

15:37.303 --> 15:39.703
You could try Amy Bergen,
maybe she would
know something.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.899
She's Cynthia's best friend.

15:44.476 --> 15:47.206
Should have told Cynthia's
parents right away, instead
of going to the school.

15:47.279 --> 15:48.303
We could have prevented this.

15:48.380 --> 15:50.746
Depends on who's responsible.
I want to check
the parents out.

15:50.816 --> 15:52.716
You think
they tossed their daughter
down a flight of stairs?

15:52.785 --> 15:55.583
Her father seemed pretty upset
about his daughter having sex.

15:55.654 --> 15:57.246
She didn't. She was raped.

15:57.323 --> 16:00.690
And what if she fabricated
the rape to cover up
sexual activity?

16:00.759 --> 16:01.885
We've had Iots of cases
Iike that.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.452
Well, you saw that girl.
She was afraid of someone.

16:04.530 --> 16:05.929
Maybe it's Dad.

16:05.998 --> 16:07.397
What, you think he raped her?

16:07.466 --> 16:09.764
We've seen it
too many times before.

16:09.835 --> 16:11.063
Cynthia does have the clap.

16:11.136 --> 16:12.865
Daddy gave it to her,
Mommy's got to have it.

16:12.938 --> 16:14.633
You really see her covering
for her husband?

16:14.707 --> 16:16.675
I don't know.
I just think we should
check the whereabouts

16:16.742 --> 16:18.733
of the parents
during the assault.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.302
First Iet's check out
the best friend.

16:23.816 --> 16:27.650
This is terrible. I should
call Darlene. See if there's
anything I can do.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.745
You sure Amy knows
something about this?

16:29.822 --> 16:32.950
If Cynthia had tension
with someone,
Amy probably knows who.

16:33.025 --> 16:35.289
If you don't mind,
we'd Iike to speak
to her alone.

16:35.361 --> 16:36.419
Why?

16:36.495 --> 16:39.623
Kids tend to keep secrets,
especially from their parents.

16:39.698 --> 16:41.290
She might shut down
in your presence.

16:41.367 --> 16:42.766
I don't think I Iike this.

16:42.835 --> 16:46.635
Her best friend
is in the hospital.
First door on your right.

16:52.077 --> 16:53.874
Shut the door, please.

16:58.117 --> 16:59.482
I know who you are.

16:59.551 --> 17:02.952
I saw you at my school
and Cynthia said
you were asking questions.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.819
Did she tell you why?

17:06.224 --> 17:07.954
Is it true that
somebody beat her up?

17:08.027 --> 17:09.790
Looks Iike it.

17:10.762 --> 17:13.163
Do you have any idea
who might have
done this to her?

17:13.232 --> 17:16.133
I promise I don't know
anything about that.

17:16.635 --> 17:18.535
Your friend needs help.

17:21.406 --> 17:23.602
Does Cynthia have a boyfriend?

17:23.675 --> 17:25.074
Tommy Kessler.

17:26.145 --> 17:28.238
Do you know if
they're having sex?

17:28.313 --> 17:30.713
We fool around
but we don't go all the way.

17:30.783 --> 17:33.183
"We"? What do you mean, "We"?

17:36.855 --> 17:41.519
Amy, you are not in trouble.
What we say here
does not Ieave this room.

17:45.631 --> 17:47.292
Okay, we have a club.

17:47.366 --> 17:48.833
Tommy and his best friend,
Nick,

17:48.901 --> 17:52.098
they throw parties
and we fool around,
but that's all.

17:52.171 --> 17:54.605
STABLER: What do you mean,
you fool around?

17:56.442 --> 17:58.273
We do stuff for beer.

18:00.612 --> 18:01.943
Like what?

18:03.715 --> 18:06.240
Well, Tommy
gets together a group,

18:06.318 --> 18:10.778
and the girls do the guys,
and they supply the beer.

18:13.125 --> 18:15.355
You're talking about oral sex.

18:20.499 --> 18:22.228
Do you use condoms?

18:24.103 --> 18:27.266
That's gross.
We don't have sex.
I told you that.

18:27.339 --> 18:30.740
Well, when was the Iast time
you had one of these parties?

18:30.809 --> 18:33.505
Day before yesterday,
and it was
the best one so far.

18:33.579 --> 18:35.069
STABLER: Cynthia there?

18:35.914 --> 18:40.578
Yeah, she goes to every one.
She has to if she wants
to stay Tommy's girl.

18:40.652 --> 18:42.176
And why's that?

18:44.490 --> 18:48.893
Well, Cynthia's my best friend
and I Iove her,

18:49.561 --> 18:53.053
but she's no hottie, you know?

18:59.004 --> 19:00.869
I hate talking
to kids this age.

19:00.939 --> 19:03.203
That's 'cause
you can't smack them
if they give you Iip.

19:03.275 --> 19:04.401
Who says I can't?

19:04.476 --> 19:06.535
Then what is your issue
with the pubescent set?

19:06.612 --> 19:09.877
The stink of pimple cream
turns my stomach.

19:10.215 --> 19:12.342
Where is this Iittle player?

19:13.018 --> 19:14.417
Over there.

19:14.686 --> 19:16.051
(CHATTERING)

19:17.356 --> 19:18.948
FIN: Tommy Kessler?

19:24.763 --> 19:27.027
We need to talk to you, too,
Nicky. Come here.

19:27.099 --> 19:29.124
Cops. That's cool.

19:30.102 --> 19:31.729
So what's up, brother?

19:31.803 --> 19:33.031
Your cancer.

19:34.273 --> 19:36.571
I feel you.
Oh, you "feel" me?

19:36.642 --> 19:39.975
Don't hit him. Let's talk
about Cynthia Wilmont.

19:40.879 --> 19:42.471
Heard she got hurt.
She okay?

19:42.548 --> 19:44.379
She got jacked up.
What you know about it?

19:44.449 --> 19:47.646
We saw her Ieave school
but we went the other way.

19:48.854 --> 19:51.186
That's how it happened,
Tommy?

19:51.256 --> 19:52.245
Yeah.

19:52.724 --> 19:54.316
What happened
a couple nights ago
at your party?

19:54.393 --> 19:56.452
Cynthia service anyone,
besides you?

19:56.528 --> 19:58.962
Oh, man. I knew
this would happen.
TOMMY: Shut up.

20:00.098 --> 20:01.963
MUNCH: Who was the Iucky guy?

20:02.434 --> 20:05.335
It doesn't matter.
Look, everybody does it.

20:05.737 --> 20:10.606
It's not sex, so a guy
doesn't get pissed if his girl
chicken heads someone else.

20:12.511 --> 20:16.311
Better tell him, Tommy.
I don't want trouble
with my parents.

20:18.317 --> 20:21.912
I didn't have money for brew,
so Cynthia offered
to try to get us some.

20:21.987 --> 20:23.011
So you pimped her?

20:23.088 --> 20:25.989
No. She's my girlfriend.
She Iikes to do me favors.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.151
Who else was she with
that night?

20:30.262 --> 20:35.529
Nick, because it was
his birthday. And there
was this older guy, he...

20:35.601 --> 20:37.330
Tall, he had brown hair.

20:37.402 --> 20:39.302
I've seen him before.
My sister Mia knows him.

20:39.371 --> 20:40.633
MUNCH: How old?

20:40.706 --> 20:43.197
Well, not grandpa old, Iike
you, but old.

20:43.275 --> 20:44.936
Twenty, thirty
or something. I don't know.

20:45.010 --> 20:48.275
And Cynthia went off with him
in exchange for what?

20:50.349 --> 20:52.010
I don't want to say.

20:53.185 --> 20:55.710
You know I want
to smack you, right?

20:57.155 --> 21:00.454
It was for some ex.
We were celebrating.

21:08.066 --> 21:10.125
Swing parties for kids.

21:10.202 --> 21:12.762
And since when is oral sex
not sex?

21:12.838 --> 21:14.396
Since Bill CIinton said so.

21:14.473 --> 21:17.067
Well, Tommy says
the older guy's
got to be our teacher

21:17.142 --> 21:18.973
and his sister
can tell us who he is.

21:19.044 --> 21:20.978
But if he taught junior high,
Tommy would have known him.

21:21.046 --> 21:25.779
Are you sure? Maybe there
is no teacher and Cynthia's
just covering up.

21:25.851 --> 21:28.547
It's still statutory rape,
whether or not
it was consensual.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.349
Doesn't matter.
Without a complaining witness,

21:30.422 --> 21:31.719
the rape doesn't exist.

21:31.790 --> 21:34.884
Unless we can tie this man
to the assault, we have
nothing to charge him with.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.394
Tommy knows more
than he's telling.
You catch that Iook?

21:37.462 --> 21:41.023
I wish I could catch
the Iittle bastard in the act
and charge him for pandering.

21:41.099 --> 21:43.033
He's got Cynthia
hooking for alcohol and drugs.

21:43.101 --> 21:44.534
Yeah, what about the drugs?

21:44.603 --> 21:47.037
The ecstasy's been consumed
so the evidentiary Iink
is gone.

21:47.105 --> 21:49.972
Is there any way
to get the rape kit
without a 61?

21:50.042 --> 21:51.407
If we can prove
an adult was with the minor,

21:51.476 --> 21:53.239
her parents can request
a rape kit be released.

21:53.312 --> 21:56.748
But once we ID the perp,
Tommy's statement isn't enough
to get a warrant for his DNA.

21:56.815 --> 21:59.181
We'd need
a corroborating witness,
or Cynthia to come clean.

21:59.251 --> 22:00.741
So we'II talk to her again,
all right?

22:00.819 --> 22:02.980
I would wait
until she's released
from the hospital.

22:03.055 --> 22:05.819
In the meantime, Munch, Fin,
talk to Tommy's sister.

22:05.891 --> 22:10.089
Get an ID on this adult
with a penchant
for crashing teenage parties.

22:16.802 --> 22:18.326
Parents around?

22:18.403 --> 22:21.463
My mom's Iaying down
and my dad's working Iate.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.301
They don't need to know
about this, right?

22:23.375 --> 22:26.811
Thought it was no big deal.
Everybody does it, right?

22:27.512 --> 22:31.004
Don't sweat it, kid.
We're here
Iooking for your sister.

22:31.717 --> 22:33.810
Mia's in her room studying.

22:35.454 --> 22:37.479
Mia.
MIA: Go away, you Iittle snot.

22:39.991 --> 22:41.185
(SNIFFING)

22:47.265 --> 22:48.755
You know,
I'm going to break your...

22:48.834 --> 22:49.892
(MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO)

22:49.968 --> 22:53.301
Damn, what kind of weed
you toking on in here, girl?

22:59.478 --> 23:00.638
Make yourselves at home.

23:00.712 --> 23:01.940
We plan to.

23:06.618 --> 23:07.812
What?

23:07.886 --> 23:11.185
Let's chat about you and your
brother's sex parties.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.653
I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:13.725 --> 23:16.626
We could wake your mom,
if you want us to.

23:16.695 --> 23:18.856
You could try.

23:18.930 --> 23:20.830
She's not sleeping.
She's passed out.

23:20.899 --> 23:22.161
MUNCH: You had a party
two nights ago.

23:22.234 --> 23:25.601
Your brother's girlfriend,
Cynthia Wilmont, was here.
Remember her?

23:25.670 --> 23:27.604
That mousy skank
is his girlfriend?

23:27.672 --> 23:29.230
Skank?

23:29.307 --> 23:32.743
Hey, she gets around.
What else am I
supposed to call her?

23:32.811 --> 23:34.676
Hey, you can't do that
without a warrant.

23:34.746 --> 23:36.043
Yes, he can.

23:36.114 --> 23:39.743
Probable cause is defined as
reasonable knowledge
of a criminal act.

23:39.818 --> 23:42.582
See, the Ionger you stall,
the more time I have
to find your stash,

23:42.654 --> 23:44.713
and when I find it,
I'm taking you in.

23:44.790 --> 23:47.054
You're not
going to juvie, sweet pea.

23:48.226 --> 23:49.284
What do you want to know?

23:49.361 --> 23:51.056
Who attends
your Iittle soirees?

23:52.931 --> 23:54.922
Just friends from school.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.731
I Iet my brother bring
his friends 'cause he
threatened to squeal.

23:58.804 --> 24:01.295
Turns out they party harder
than high school kids.

24:01.373 --> 24:05.207
Smoke a Iittle weed, Iisten
to some tunes, one thing
turns into another, right?

24:05.277 --> 24:09.304
You Iook Iike you did
some damage in your day.
Where's the crime?

24:09.714 --> 24:12.205
IIIegal drugs
and statutory rape.

24:14.319 --> 24:15.445
Who got raped?

24:15.520 --> 24:17.010
A witness statement
from one of your guests

24:17.088 --> 24:19.386
places an adult
at this shindig.

24:20.592 --> 24:22.719
You must mean Ross McKenzie.

24:22.961 --> 24:24.258
Describe him.

24:24.329 --> 24:30.290
He's 24, built,
kind of cute, very cool.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.769
Hey, if you think he raped
anybody, you're crazy.

24:34.840 --> 24:36.102
And why's that?

24:36.174 --> 24:38.574
Well, 'cause he can have
anybody he wants.

24:38.643 --> 24:40.668
He's a substitute teacher
at my high school

24:40.779 --> 24:43.942
and he's only interested
in mature women Iike me.

24:44.850 --> 24:46.875
Well, I guess we found
our teacher.

24:46.952 --> 24:48.715
What do we have
so far on this creep?

24:48.787 --> 24:52.086
Ross McKenzie, 24,
assigned to Harrison High.

24:52.157 --> 24:55.217
Described by
one of his students
as the epitome of cool.

24:55.293 --> 24:57.625
You'd think
with all that Iegal
nubile flesh around there,

24:57.696 --> 24:58.993
he'd sample that instead.

24:59.064 --> 25:01.089
Evidently he Iikes them
a Iot younger.

25:01.166 --> 25:04.863
Board of education has him
Iisted as a substitute teacher
for the Iast two years.

25:04.936 --> 25:06.597
One arrest. No convictions.

25:06.671 --> 25:10.163
A bust fell apart three
years ago for soliciting
an eight ball of coke.

25:10.242 --> 25:12.210
MUNCH: From entrapment?
Yeah.

25:12.277 --> 25:14.837
Which is why
he didn't have to put it
on his school application.

25:14.913 --> 25:17.074
Well, if he's our perp,
how did he know
that we talked to Cynthia?

25:17.148 --> 25:18.410
He doesn't teach
middle school.

25:18.483 --> 25:22.317
Kids talk. Tommy could
have told his sister.
She informed McKenzie.

25:22.387 --> 25:26.050
Well, if this teacher
did do it, then he definitely
wasn't working that day,

25:26.124 --> 25:28.684
since the high school Iets out
after Cynthia was attacked.

25:28.760 --> 25:31.786
So check with
the Harrison principal
on McKenzie's whereabouts.

25:31.863 --> 25:35.492
If this pans out, haul him in
for a hard interview.

25:39.738 --> 25:43.196
The kids Iove him.
He Iistens to their music,
he talks their talk,

25:43.275 --> 25:45.140
and they call him
by his first name.

25:45.210 --> 25:47.178
Well, what's wrong with that,
if the kids Iearn?

25:47.245 --> 25:51.181
BIur the Iine between
student and teacher
and chaos will ensue.

25:51.249 --> 25:52.807
What's McKenzie done exactly?

25:52.884 --> 25:55.352
We're still Iooking into it.
Was he working Monday?

25:55.420 --> 25:58.821
Not here, but that doesn't
mean he wasn't working
at another school.

25:58.890 --> 26:03.554
In case you haven't heard,
we're short on qualified
teachers, money and supplies,

26:03.628 --> 26:05.789
which just causes us
to Iower our standards.

26:05.864 --> 26:06.853
You don't Iike him.

26:06.932 --> 26:08.695
I can't afford
to dislike anyone.

26:08.767 --> 26:11.895
But I take issue with
Iax rules and fraternizing
with the students.

26:11.970 --> 26:13.870
BENSON: Has anyone
Iodged a complaint
against him?

26:13.939 --> 26:16.271
Not yet, but it's
only a matter of time.

26:16.341 --> 26:17.638
Where's McKenzie now?

26:18.610 --> 26:22.011
He has a free period.
You should find him
in the teacher's Iounge.

26:26.351 --> 26:28.148
BENSON: Ross McKenzie?
Yeah?

26:28.687 --> 26:31.247
Detectives Benson and Stabler,
we'd Iike to ask you
a few questions.

26:31.323 --> 26:32.347
What's this about?

26:32.424 --> 26:33.448
It's a sensitive subject,

26:33.525 --> 26:35.823
so we'd Iike to take this back
to our precinct.

26:35.894 --> 26:38.158
Well, I've got classes.
Have somebody cover for you.

26:38.229 --> 26:39.856
Not until I find out
what this is about.

26:39.931 --> 26:41.592
Well, I guess we can
interview you right here.

26:41.666 --> 26:45.500
We need answers about
drug distribution and
sex parties involving minors.

26:45.570 --> 26:46.935
You ready?

26:47.005 --> 26:50.099
Okay, okay. Just give me
a couple of minutes
to talk to the principal.

26:50.175 --> 26:53.269
BENSON: It's already done.
Why don't you grab your coat?

26:57.115 --> 26:59.310
You Iike substitute teaching?

26:59.818 --> 27:01.376
Right now it pays the bills.

27:01.453 --> 27:03.580
I mean, my sights are set
on a college professorship.

27:03.655 --> 27:05.646
Maybe a nice cushy tenure
somewhere small.

27:05.724 --> 27:07.351
Were you working on Monday?

27:07.425 --> 27:08.790
No.

27:08.860 --> 27:10.122
Where were you all day?

27:10.195 --> 27:12.186
I was home doing
a Iesson plan. Why?

27:12.263 --> 27:14.458
Now, you only teach
high school kids?

27:14.532 --> 27:15.556
It's safer that way.

27:15.634 --> 27:18.159
My teaching methods
are considered
a Iittle unorthodox.

27:18.236 --> 27:21.933
Is that because
you get too familiar
with the student body?

27:22.574 --> 27:24.201
You've been talking
to the principal.

27:24.275 --> 27:26.539
See, he hasn't changed
the curricula since the '70s.

27:26.611 --> 27:29.808
If you want to reach the kids,
you to have to meet them
at their Ievel.

27:29.881 --> 27:32.441
And partying with them
does that for you?

27:32.951 --> 27:35.749
Where's this coming from?
I don't party
with my students.

27:35.820 --> 27:37.788
Really?
Then what were you doing
at the Kessler apartment

27:37.856 --> 27:39.619
a couple nights ago?

27:40.959 --> 27:42.950
Relieving parental concerns.

27:43.028 --> 27:44.120
So you're a chaperone?

27:44.195 --> 27:47.858
Yes, I've done it before.
Mia asks me to cover
so her friends can attend,

27:47.932 --> 27:49.695
because the mother
isn't capable.

27:49.768 --> 27:53.602
A witness put drugs
and alcohol at this party.
Where were you?

27:54.072 --> 27:55.767
No one did anything
Iike that in front of me.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.501
For a chaperone,
you're not very observant.

27:57.575 --> 28:00.772
Well, I also don't have eyes
in the back of my head,
Detective.

28:00.845 --> 28:03.643
I mean, Iisten. If the kids
want to do something,
they're going to find a way.

28:03.715 --> 28:07.276
Were you aware
that there were
14-year-old minors there?

28:07.352 --> 28:11.311
Sure. Mia has to watch
her brother
'cause of the home situation,

28:11.823 --> 28:15.816
and she said that he could
have friends in his room,
to keep him quiet,

28:15.894 --> 28:17.794
but they weren't
any of my responsibility.

28:17.862 --> 28:20.262
How do you explain
the hits of ecstasy
you gave them?

28:20.331 --> 28:21.958
They Iied to you.

28:22.634 --> 28:25.432
Kids tend to do that
when their backs
are against a wall.

28:25.503 --> 28:26.868
Adults, too.

28:34.612 --> 28:36.102
We've got nothing
to tie him to the assault.

28:36.181 --> 28:38.706
You said that we needed
a corroborating statement
to pursue the drugs.

28:38.783 --> 28:40.182
What about the other boy,
Nick Radsen?

28:40.251 --> 28:41.309
Not good enough.

28:41.386 --> 28:44.446
He was a recipient
of Cynthia's services.
I would argue intent.

28:44.522 --> 28:46.422
Well, that puts us back
at square one.

28:46.491 --> 28:49.051
Call me when you
get something.

28:49.127 --> 28:52.062
Cynthia was just released
from the hospital.

28:52.397 --> 28:54.297
Persuading her to talk
is not going to be easy.

28:54.365 --> 28:57.266
Tell her what you know.
Give her details.
It might force her hand.

28:57.335 --> 28:59.701
EIIiot, have a sit down
with the parents.

28:59.771 --> 29:04.265
You can't tell them
about the rape, but you can
tell them what we do here.

29:09.481 --> 29:12.575
Public health official's
been here three times.

29:12.650 --> 29:14.140
He wants a Iist of names.

29:15.453 --> 29:19.184
So he went to Amy and
she's so scared she spilled
her guts about sex parties.

29:19.257 --> 29:21.589
Fourteen-year-old sex parties,
for God's sake.

29:21.659 --> 29:23.752
Amy's parents blame Cynthia,

29:23.828 --> 29:26.490
so now she's Iost
her best friend
along with everything else.

29:26.564 --> 29:28.691
Neither one of you
could have prevented this.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.428
What the hell
do you know about it?

29:30.502 --> 29:34.666
I'm a detective
that works sex crimes.
My squad, all we handle

29:34.739 --> 29:37.173
are sexually based crimes.

29:37.242 --> 29:41.406
Child abuse, abandonment,
and rape cases.

29:46.351 --> 29:48.842
You're saying
my Iittle girl was raped?

29:48.920 --> 29:50.979
Law's pretty clear
about what I can and can't do.

29:51.055 --> 29:56.584
Let's just say,
hypothetically, if a
14 year-old girl were raped,

29:56.661 --> 30:00.757
and she doesn't want to report
it, I can't investigate it.

30:00.832 --> 30:02.390
I can't make an arrest.

30:02.467 --> 30:06.164
Cynthia was raped
and won't talk?

30:06.237 --> 30:07.704
Is that what you're saying?

30:09.340 --> 30:12.070
I'm not allowed
to answer that question.

30:19.117 --> 30:21.108
This is good news.

30:21.186 --> 30:22.380
What?

30:22.453 --> 30:26.253
How can you bring yourself
to think that,
much Iess say it?

30:26.324 --> 30:29.293
If Cynthia got gonorrhea
from being raped,

30:29.360 --> 30:32.818
then it wasn't her fault.
She didn't do anything wrong.

30:37.268 --> 30:38.997
CYNTHIA: What's
gonna happen now?

30:39.337 --> 30:40.634
Nothing.

30:40.705 --> 30:42.229
Even though I know
what happened that night,

30:42.307 --> 30:44.741
I still can't do anything
if you won't talk.

30:44.809 --> 30:46.572
You know?

30:46.644 --> 30:48.111
Yeah, most of it.

30:49.814 --> 30:52.874
I know that Tommy
makes you do things that
you probably don't want to.

30:52.951 --> 30:55.181
That's not true. I Iove Tommy.

30:56.654 --> 31:00.454
Well, I know
that he traded you
to a man for drugs.

31:00.558 --> 31:03.652
Now, that doesn't sound to me
Iike he cares about you
very much.

31:03.728 --> 31:06.526
Tommy wouldn't do that.
He's my boyfriend.

31:07.098 --> 31:10.192
The most popular guy in school
and he picked me.

31:10.568 --> 31:13.435
And that's important to you?
Being part of the in crowd?

31:13.504 --> 31:14.801
It's everything.

31:14.873 --> 31:17.433
But it's not worth
your safety or your health.

31:17.508 --> 31:19.203
Well, it doesn't matter now.

31:19.277 --> 31:21.142
My parents know
about the parties.

31:22.380 --> 31:25.611
My dad won't even Iook at me.
I think he hates me.

31:25.683 --> 31:27.480
Cynthia, your dad
doesn't hate you.

31:27.552 --> 31:29.076
He's just upset.

31:29.654 --> 31:32.145
They just want
what's best for you.

31:32.490 --> 31:34.321
Look at my mom.

31:34.392 --> 31:36.952
She's beautiful.
If I Iooked Iike her...

31:37.028 --> 31:39.929
There's nothing wrong
with the way you Iook.

31:40.365 --> 31:41.855
You are beautiful, too.

31:41.933 --> 31:43.366
Right. On the inside.

31:43.902 --> 31:47.497
Pretty girls always say that
to make the ugly ones
feel better.

31:47.572 --> 31:50.097
Everyone has doubts
and problems,

31:50.174 --> 31:52.574
even the ones in the so-called
popular crowd.

31:52.644 --> 31:54.043
Not from where I'm sitting.

31:54.112 --> 31:57.809
Your friends
are scared and in pain,
just Iike you, Cynthia.

31:57.882 --> 32:01.545
But they don't have
half of your resilience
and half of your courage.

32:01.619 --> 32:02.711
Sure.

32:02.787 --> 32:06.689
You were raped and you went
to that hospital
all by yourself.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.055
Do you know
that there are grown women

32:08.126 --> 32:10.720
who couldn't
cope with that situation
the way you have?

32:10.795 --> 32:13.025
Really?
Yeah, really.

32:14.065 --> 32:19.093
Now, all you have to do
is say the word
and we will go get him.

32:22.307 --> 32:23.774
I don't know.

32:29.414 --> 32:34.852
We don't have to take care
of this right now, but I want
you to think about it, okay?

32:42.226 --> 32:44.194
It was the teacher.

32:46.965 --> 32:50.059
Ross McKenzie. He raped me.

32:54.372 --> 32:57.000
MCKENZIE:
Hamlet was a eunuch. His...

32:58.376 --> 32:59.741
I hope this can wait.

32:59.811 --> 33:02.803
Sorry to disappoint you,
but you have an appointment
with a needle.

33:02.880 --> 33:04.347
What, you want my blood?
What for?

33:04.415 --> 33:07.077
To match your DNA
to a rape kit.

33:07.585 --> 33:11.180
Mr. Charest, this is a
mistake. They've got the wrong
guy. I never raped anyone.

33:11.255 --> 33:13.951
Save your energy
for the school board,
Mr. McKenzie.

33:14.025 --> 33:16.425
I've already started
the paperwork to fire you.

33:16.494 --> 33:17.722
I want to call my Iawyer.

33:17.795 --> 33:20.093
Just so Iong as she isn't 14.

33:25.937 --> 33:28.906
My client
never touched the girl,
so the DNA won't match.

33:28.973 --> 33:31.669
Well, then he should be
more than ready to tell us
what happened at the party.

33:31.743 --> 33:35.577
He doesn't have to say a word.
As soon as your Iab confirms
it, we're walking out.

33:35.646 --> 33:37.876
We'II just keep coming back
till we get some answers.

33:37.949 --> 33:40.383
At the school, to your home,
the board of education.

33:40.451 --> 33:42.078
I think you get the picture.

33:42.153 --> 33:44.485
You'II just force me
to file a harassment suit,
Detective.

33:44.555 --> 33:46.955
Who said anything about
harassing your client?
That would be wrong.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.357
Ross, you've got a drug habit.

33:49.427 --> 33:53.659
Do you really want
all this attention when you're
going to make your next buy?

33:59.871 --> 34:02.965
Go ahead, tell them.
They can't charge you
with anything.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.668
There's no proof.

34:05.610 --> 34:07.908
I gave up two tabs of ex,
hoping to get some action.

34:07.979 --> 34:10.947
The girl freaked out
and wouldn't do it.
I never Iaid a finger on her.

34:11.014 --> 34:13.415
You tried to prey
on a 14-year-old girl.

34:13.484 --> 34:16.385
I was high, and, from what I
could see, she wasn't
into the word "no".

34:16.454 --> 34:20.117
Bear in mind you can't
charge my client
with intent to rape.

34:20.190 --> 34:22.125
Who else was Cynthia with
that night?

34:22.193 --> 34:24.024
She never Ieft Tommy
and Nick's side.

34:24.094 --> 34:25.527
If she was really raped,

34:25.596 --> 34:27.928
it was probably
one of them who did it.

34:29.600 --> 34:32.899
He's sticking to his story.
CIaims he never touched her.

34:32.969 --> 34:37.771
He didn't. His DNA came back
negative. The real question
is, was she raped?

34:38.743 --> 34:40.108
I still believe she was.

34:40.178 --> 34:41.770
Then why Iie
about the teacher?

34:41.846 --> 34:44.007
Because she desperately
wants to belong.

34:44.081 --> 34:48.109
She points at Tommy or Nick,
she's out of
the popular crowd.

34:48.219 --> 34:50.187
That's taking peer pressure
to the extreme.

34:50.254 --> 34:53.485
I am really getting sick
of these kids, which is
probably why I don't have any.

34:53.558 --> 34:54.855
Round them up and Iean hard.

34:54.926 --> 34:57.656
Captain, Cynthia's still
a rape victim.

34:57.995 --> 34:59.428
Who Iied to the police,

34:59.497 --> 35:02.398
severely compromising
any trial on her behalf.

35:02.600 --> 35:05.933
Once she opted to speak,
she set the ball in motion.

35:06.003 --> 35:10.303
Interview rooms one,
two and my office,
with their parents, now.

35:11.275 --> 35:16.042
Tommy told detectives
he gave Cynthia to you
for your birthday.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.274
Is that right?

35:17.348 --> 35:18.508
Yes.

35:18.583 --> 35:21.017
Nick, no.
What were you thinking?

35:21.085 --> 35:22.814
Cynthia go with you
willingly?

35:22.887 --> 35:23.911
Eventually.

35:23.988 --> 35:25.615
STABLER: Where did you two go
to be alone?

35:25.690 --> 35:27.089
Tommy's room.

35:28.126 --> 35:30.287
She said no but he insisted.

35:30.962 --> 35:33.226
So what happened
when the door closed?

35:33.297 --> 35:36.027
We talked for a while.
We have a Iot in common.

35:36.100 --> 35:37.931
We're both good in school.
We Iove computers.

35:38.002 --> 35:39.196
We Iike to read.

35:40.271 --> 35:43.001
It kills me that he treats her
Iike a slave.

35:44.976 --> 35:48.036
I'm gonna get
right to the point,
Mr. and Mrs. Wilmont.

35:48.112 --> 35:50.103
Your daughter Iied to us.

35:51.115 --> 35:53.743
She wouldn't do that.
She was raped.

35:54.085 --> 35:57.384
Right now, I'm not questioning
whether or not she was raped.

35:57.455 --> 35:59.047
She Iied about who did it.

35:59.123 --> 36:00.750
I don't understand.

36:02.093 --> 36:06.496
You think a teacher
who attends kids' parties
is innocent?

36:06.564 --> 36:10.466
The man is guilty
of questionable ethics
but he's not a rapist.

36:10.535 --> 36:13.595
His DNA didn't match
your daughter's rape kit.

36:17.341 --> 36:19.002
Speak up, Cynthia.

36:22.914 --> 36:28.113
Young Iady, you are not going
anywhere until I find out
who you're protecting.

36:28.886 --> 36:31.719
Is it your boyfriend, Tommy?
No.

36:31.789 --> 36:35.225
He admitted to giving you
to this teacher for drugs.

36:36.127 --> 36:38.652
Did he get angry
when you wouldn't do it?

36:39.363 --> 36:41.126
Did he threaten you?

36:41.199 --> 36:43.463
What the hell's going on here?

36:43.534 --> 36:45.399
Are you saying
my daughter's a prostitute?

36:45.469 --> 36:49.462
What I'm saying is
that I believe she would
do anything for this boy.

36:50.641 --> 36:52.370
I don't believe it.

37:03.020 --> 37:06.581
DAVID: You made me leave work
for this? This isn't a crime,

37:07.291 --> 37:09.486
MUNCH: Your son's been
engaging in unprotected sex,

37:09.560 --> 37:11.926
DAVID: Come on,
the boy's just curious,

37:11.996 --> 37:15.022
He had an itch, He got
it scratched, Good for him,

37:15.099 --> 37:17.090
Tommy's a little pimp,

37:17.168 --> 37:20.797
He trades his girlfriend's
services for alcohol
and drugs.

37:21.172 --> 37:25.131
MUNCH: Someone raped Cynthia
at the Iast party
and we want to know who.

37:26.110 --> 37:29.978
That true?
Don't you Iie to me.

37:32.516 --> 37:35.349
Cynthia does the guys
that I tell her to.

37:36.153 --> 37:37.848
I don't force her.

37:38.990 --> 37:40.617
TOMMY: I don't have to,

37:41.425 --> 37:43.893
DAVID: Why would you do this?
I don't know,

37:44.729 --> 37:50.190
I guess because all the
really pretty girls,
they don't put out, She does,

37:51.869 --> 37:56.533
She does what I tell her
to do, to whoever I say,
whenever I want,

38:13.791 --> 38:16.851
He said Nick had never been
with a girl before,

38:17.795 --> 38:21.822
and that it was his birthday,
and if I really Ioved him,

38:22.500 --> 38:24.832
I would do this
for his friend.

38:32.209 --> 38:34.575
So you go into the room
with him?

38:34.679 --> 38:38.843
He was telling corny jokes.
He was being really sweet.

38:38.916 --> 38:42.818
But I still didn't want to.
I mean, how could I?

38:43.754 --> 38:45.381
I'm Tommy's girl.

38:47.224 --> 38:49.351
Is that when it turned ugly?

38:58.069 --> 38:59.536
BENSON: You must've hated her.

38:59.603 --> 39:01.594
No, I Iike her.

39:02.273 --> 39:05.800
Cynthia's too smart
to be used by that clown.
Tommy's Iame.

39:05.876 --> 39:08.174
STABLER: And that's what
pisses you off.

39:08.646 --> 39:12.207
He's the one
getting all the attention,
the girls, the glory.

39:12.283 --> 39:14.615
That's not how it is.
He's my friend.

39:14.685 --> 39:18.052
No, he's not. He gives you
his Ieftovers, man.

39:19.056 --> 39:22.514
I mean, that's got to
burn you, knowing that
he's not in your Ieague.

39:22.593 --> 39:24.424
You think
Tommy's beneath you.

39:24.495 --> 39:28.522
But he's the most
popular guy in school.
That's why Cynthia Iikes him.

39:28.599 --> 39:30.829
That's why Cynthia
wouldn't give you
the time of day,

39:30.901 --> 39:32.732
and that's why
you had to take
what you wanted.

39:32.803 --> 39:35.203
I've heard enough.
We're Ieaving.

39:37.908 --> 39:42.436
She started to cry,
Iike being with me
was so awful.

39:46.183 --> 39:49.380
I told her I'd tell Tommy
and then she Iaid down, but...

39:50.521 --> 39:53.581
Then she changed her mind.
Girls can't do that.

39:57.261 --> 39:58.990
Then what happened?

40:00.664 --> 40:01.892
Nothing.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.532
Well, you had sex, didn't you?

40:11.509 --> 40:13.136
She Iet me do it.

40:15.780 --> 40:17.270
She fight you?

40:18.549 --> 40:21.985
She said no
but she just Iaid there.

40:27.958 --> 40:31.291
Afterwards, she said we'd
never talk about it again.

40:32.196 --> 40:33.629
Is that why you beat her up?

40:33.697 --> 40:35.528
'Cause you thought she'd come
and talk to us?

40:35.599 --> 40:39.399
No. She gave me the clap
and she didn't even apologize.

40:39.503 --> 40:41.494
So you followed her home?

40:43.340 --> 40:47.401
After baseball practice,
she accused me of rape,

40:47.478 --> 40:50.538
and that pissed me off,
'cause that just
didn't happen.

40:51.482 --> 40:54.315
If she wants Tommy,
she can have him.
He's a Ioser.

40:54.518 --> 40:56.145
So are you, Nick.
