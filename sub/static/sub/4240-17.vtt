Glee on in the stacks.

10:30.213 --> 10:31.672
Genius!

10:31.756 --> 10:36.427
I never really understood how
hard it is to be laughed at,

10:36.511 --> 10:39.722
particularly in slow motion.

10:39.806 --> 10:43.183
I try to make it seem like
nothing can touch me, but, boy-

10:43.268 --> 10:45.769
Jean, I'm so sorry
you ever felt that way.

10:45.854 --> 10:47.980
I'm sorry I didn't protect you more.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.207

11:07.292 --> 11:10.085
You're probably wondering, what
exactly does Sue Sylvester mean...

11:10.170 --> 11:12.546
when she says, "I'm your new therapist"?

11:12.630 --> 11:14.548
Well, let me explain.

11:14.632 --> 11:17.468
As you may or may not know, I
star in a little music video...

11:17.552 --> 11:19.345
that's been circulating around the Web,

11:19.429 --> 11:22.181
a video that has a tendency to
induce cruel, slow-motion laughter.

11:22.265 --> 11:25.100
No. No. Didn't—
Didn't know about that.

11:25.185 --> 11:28.145
Well, this video has inspired Sue
Sylvester to start giving back.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.147
I happen to have my
master's in counseling,

11:30.231 --> 11:33.484
and when I heard that our school
district's one-and-only psychologist...

11:33.568 --> 11:35.486
had committed suicide,

11:35.570 --> 11:38.530
well, I decided to
volunteer my services.

11:38.615 --> 11:41.367
And they gave me your name.
I'd really like to help.

11:41.451 --> 11:44.036

supposed to feel about this.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.829
Ella, you're crippled by mental illness.

11:45.914 --> 11:49.291
Your compulsions have estranged
you from your own feelings.

11:49.376 --> 11:52.461
You nearly married a gym teacher
who's more gravy than man,

11:52.545 --> 11:56.882
and you're content to be repeatedly
lied to by the man you purport to love.

11:57.008 --> 11:59.134
I'm sorry? I bribed Will
Schuester's landlord...

11:59.219 --> 12:03.222
to slip baby monitors under
his couch and under his bed.

12:03.306 --> 12:07.101
Turns out he's been having make-out sessions
with the coach from Vocal Adrenaline...

12:07.185 --> 12:09.937

banana magnet April Rhodes.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.815

12:15.902 --> 12:18.237

12:18.321 --> 12:20.447
You take weird little
strides when you walk,

12:20.532 --> 12:23.534

Japan and someone bound your feet.

12:23.618 --> 12:26.870
- You make a valid point.
- Grow a pair! I'm insulting you!

12:26.955 --> 12:31.875
You refuse to stand up foryourself,
you're so afraid ofconfrontation.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.002
You're right. Ifyou want to get better,

12:34.087 --> 12:36.463
you need to start
communicating your feelings.

12:36.548 --> 12:40.676
You need to let Will Schuester know how
he's made you feel, and in a public setting,

12:40.760 --> 12:43.637
so he can't escape and
he won't manipulate you.

12:43.721 --> 12:48.517
Trust me
- you need to let him have it.

12:51.688 --> 12:54.356

12:54.441 --> 12:58.986
The fact is that slumming it with
me actually improved your reputation.

12:59.070 --> 13:01.947
It gave you a sense of humanity.

13:02.031 --> 13:04.032
Wait. Do you want to date again?

13:04.117 --> 13:06.034

reputation and stay in Glee.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.425
What song do you wanna
do foryour assignment?

13:21.509 --> 13:27.389
I've chosen David Geddes's fantastically
terrible '70s Top 1 0 hit, "Run Joey Run."

something that you would do.

me for a few mistakes I've made.

couple of imperfect performances...

building up inside of me like a volcano...

in, and then it just comes bursting out.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.734
Granted, generally, I'm right,

14:20.818 --> 14:23.195

14:23.279 --> 14:25.155
It does suck when you do that.
