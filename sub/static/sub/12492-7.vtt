00:04.271 --> 00:06.705
Hey, everybody,
I'm home.

00:09.976 --> 00:12.578
- And I've got presents.
- Yes! Awesome.

00:12.579 --> 00:15.581
- Hi, dad.
- Daddy, we missed you.

00:15.582 --> 00:17.650
I love you, presents.

00:17.651 --> 00:20.186
I mean dad!

00:20.187 --> 00:22.088
Okay, so I'm doing

00:22.089 --> 00:25.024
an extermination job over
at Loony Larry's electronics.

00:25.025 --> 00:28.861
He was infested with termites,
rats and great deals!

00:28.862 --> 00:32.231
Because he's loony!

00:32.232 --> 00:35.634
Okay, for P.J.

00:35.635 --> 00:39.205
- For Teddy.
- Smart phones, awesome!

00:39.206 --> 00:41.841
- Thank you so much.
- Where's my smart phone?

00:41.842 --> 00:45.144
P.J.'s holding it. You're gonna
get it in about four years.

00:46.346 --> 00:49.615
But for you I got a
remote-control helicopter!

00:49.616 --> 00:52.284
- This is cool.
- ...That we put together ourselves.

00:52.285 --> 00:54.854
- Ruined it.
- What?

00:54.855 --> 00:56.822
I thought this would be
a fun father-son project.

00:56.823 --> 01:00.493
Okay, why don't you put it
together with your father

01:00.494 --> 01:02.762
And give me a call.

01:02.763 --> 01:05.965
And I even got

01:05.966 --> 01:08.601
A little something
for Charlie.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.606
* I'm a happy happy horse *

01:13.607 --> 01:15.040
* happy happy
happy horse *

01:15.041 --> 01:16.742
* I'm a happy happy horse *

01:16.743 --> 01:18.811
* happy happy
happy horse *

01:20.647 --> 01:22.748
<i>* I'm a happy
happy horse... *</i>

01:22.749 --> 01:25.951
- That's gonna get old.
- I think it just did.

02:21.875 --> 02:24.910
I love my new
phone so much.

02:24.911 --> 02:28.447
See, it surfs the web,
it takes video, plays music.

02:28.448 --> 02:32.084
We're just so
happy together.

02:32.085 --> 02:35.654
Man, the last present my dad
got for me was a book...

02:35.655 --> 02:38.257
Called "fun with science."
and guess what?

02:38.258 --> 02:40.092
The title was a lie.

02:40.093 --> 02:42.161
Oh, hey, you want
to check out

02:42.162 --> 02:44.797
The trailer for the new
vampire movie "Dusk"?

02:44.798 --> 02:46.832
Oh, you know I do.

02:46.833 --> 02:49.368
Those vampires are so cute.

02:49.369 --> 02:53.472
There must be something about being
undead that gives you rock-hard abs.

02:53.473 --> 02:56.875
Oh, hey, we should go
to the first show.

02:56.876 --> 02:58.811
Which is...

02:58.812 --> 03:01.180
Oh, Thursday at midnight.

03:01.181 --> 03:04.550
My mom would never let me out
that late on a school night.

03:04.551 --> 03:07.419
Just do what I do...
tell your mom how cool she is.

03:07.420 --> 03:09.922
Then you get
whatever you want.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.990
That really works?

03:11.991 --> 03:15.627
How do you think I got that
leather skirt I can't sit down in?

03:17.330 --> 03:20.966
I don't know. I mean,
I'm not a very good liar.

03:20.967 --> 03:24.002
- That scarf looks really great on you.
- Doesn't it?

03:24.003 --> 03:26.138
Yeah, I could totally
pull this off.

03:36.583 --> 03:38.717
I hope we end up being
lab partners, dude.

03:38.718 --> 03:40.819
- I don't.
- What's that supposed to mean?

03:40.820 --> 03:42.454
Don't make me say it.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.892
- Oh, yes, I got walter!
- Oh, great.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.827
You get the president
of the science club,

03:48.828 --> 03:51.497
And I'm stuck with
this dumb Lug van Brundt.

03:51.498 --> 03:53.866
- What did you just say?
- I said...

03:53.867 --> 03:57.302
I'd... I'd love to give
a hug to van Brundt.

03:57.303 --> 03:59.037
Don't!

03:59.038 --> 04:00.539
Okay...

04:00.540 --> 04:02.841
Lab partner buddy.

04:02.842 --> 04:04.176
My phone number.

04:04.177 --> 04:06.278
Call me when it's done.

04:06.279 --> 04:08.514
- You got it, big guy.
- Don't call me big guy.

04:08.515 --> 04:10.983
Very sorry.

04:13.553 --> 04:15.621
Hey, great news...
we're partners.

04:15.622 --> 04:19.625
Yeah, there's no need
for us to get together.

04:19.625 --> 04:22.361
I'll do the project and put
both of our names on it.

04:22.362 --> 04:25.931
Oh, I love you, man!

04:34.240 --> 04:36.041
Hey, whatcha doing, mom?

04:36.042 --> 04:38.977
Oh, just going through the
spices, tossing out the old ones.

04:38.978 --> 04:41.380
Oh, that is so cool.

04:42.949 --> 04:47.252
- It is? - Well, maybe it's
just the way you do it.

04:47.253 --> 04:50.022
Well, I do have a system.

04:50.023 --> 04:52.291
It's alphabetical.

04:53.893 --> 04:57.596
Okay, cardamom comes before cinnamon
which comes before coriander.

04:57.597 --> 05:01.166
Whoa, I could listen to you
talk about spices all day.

05:01.167 --> 05:04.136
- Then we go onto dill...
- Okay.

05:04.137 --> 05:07.339
Then it kind of
jumps around to fennel.

05:07.340 --> 05:11.310
But instead, how about
we talk about clothes?

05:11.311 --> 05:13.345
Like that awesome new top
you're wearing.

05:13.346 --> 05:15.581
You like this?
Honey, I've had it forever.

05:15.582 --> 05:18.817
And I especially love that
splash of color on your shoulder.

05:18.818 --> 05:20.452
What, that?

05:20.453 --> 05:22.387
I think that's
Charlie's puke.

05:23.523 --> 05:26.024
Let's talk
about your shoes.

05:28.661 --> 05:31.263
Hello?
Oh, hey, Ivy.

05:31.264 --> 05:32.864
You want me to come over?

05:32.865 --> 05:35.400
Oh no, sorry. I'd rather
hang out with my mom.

05:35.401 --> 05:38.837
Okay, talk to you later.
Bye.

05:40.940 --> 05:43.508
Are you sick? Are you
gonna puke on me too?

05:45.845 --> 05:47.679
No, why?

05:47.680 --> 05:49.615
You'd rqther hang out
with me than Ivy?

05:49.616 --> 05:53.051
Mom, does cinnamon
come before coriander?

05:55.521 --> 05:58.423
That is the sweetest thing
you have ever said to me.

06:01.227 --> 06:03.061
My little wooskie.

06:05.765 --> 06:08.634
* I'm a happy happy horse *

06:08.635 --> 06:10.769
* happy happy
happy horse *

06:10.770 --> 06:13.839
* happy happy happy horse... *

06:16.409 --> 06:19.244
Yeah, sounds like happy horse
needs some new batteries.

06:19.245 --> 06:23.548
No! I can't get that
stupid song out of my head.

06:24.751 --> 06:27.586
All right, all right.
You know what?

06:27.587 --> 06:30.689
Let's build us
a helicopter.

06:30.690 --> 06:34.026
And the fun begins

06:34.027 --> 06:36.461
With the instruction manual.

06:36.462 --> 06:37.629
Dad, do we have to?

06:37.630 --> 06:40.499
Yes, we have to.
Oh! You know what?

06:40.500 --> 06:43.268
We should start with the
"before you begin" pamphlet.

06:43.269 --> 06:46.338
Oh, and there's a dvd!
Which we will watch

06:46.339 --> 06:49.908
After the pamphlet
and the instruction manual.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.478
Dad, how long
is this gonna take?

06:53.479 --> 06:55.614
Oh, not long.
Oh, hey,ook at this!

06:55.615 --> 06:59.117
Oooh, a "before you
watch the dvd" card.

07:06.092 --> 07:08.193
If there's anything better

07:08.194 --> 07:11.596
Than a homemade facial with my
"bmf," I haven't heard of it.

07:11.597 --> 07:14.232
- B.M.F.?
- Best mom forever.

07:14.233 --> 07:17.869
Oh my gosh! I would be smiling,
but my face is going to crack.

07:19.806 --> 07:21.306
What's going on?

07:21.307 --> 07:23.442
Oh, just a couple girlfriends
hanging out.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.444
What, is Ivy here?

07:25.445 --> 07:27.312
No, I'm talking
about me and mom.

07:27.313 --> 07:28.914
We've been hanging out
all afternoon.

07:28.915 --> 07:31.383
We went to the mall.
We went shopping.

07:31.384 --> 07:35.587
Then we did some other
stuff I can't tell you about.

07:35.588 --> 07:39.624
- Yeah, well, I didn't ask. - That's
good 'cause we're not gonna tell you.

07:39.625 --> 07:42.928
Yeah, I'm gonna be
in the other room.

07:42.929 --> 07:46.064
Oh, dad, I actually need to
ask you guys about something.

07:46.065 --> 07:49.935
Is it okay if Ivy and I go to
a midnight movie on Thursday?

07:49.936 --> 07:52.003
Thursday?
No way, it's a school night.

07:57.243 --> 07:59.711
Bob, honey, you don't
understand, okay?

07:59.712 --> 08:02.814
This isn't just any movie.
This is "Dusk."

08:03.716 --> 08:06.051
- What's that?
- Hello!

08:06.052 --> 08:08.687
The movie about
the vampires.

08:08.688 --> 08:10.589
The prequel to "Dawn."

08:10.590 --> 08:12.591
So lame!

08:12.592 --> 08:15.827
All right, you know what? You
wanna let her go, let her go.

08:15.828 --> 08:18.730
- Okay! Thank you, daddy.
Thank you, girlfriend. - Teddy.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.534
* Call me! *

08:27.807 --> 08:29.674
What's that in your hair?

08:29.675 --> 08:32.043
It's called glitter.
Get with it, grandpa.

08:37.150 --> 08:39.251
Emmett!
Thank you.

08:39.251 --> 08:42.120
I can't believe I have to do this
whole chemistry project by myself.

08:42.121 --> 08:45.323
- Stupid van Brundt!
- Hey, don't call him stupid.

08:45.324 --> 08:47.959
That's an insult to stupid
people everywhere.

08:49.395 --> 08:51.430
That idiot can't even
count to 10,

08:51.431 --> 08:54.966
Which, coincidentally, is the number of
years he's going to be in high school.

08:58.271 --> 09:00.472
Guess that's my phone.

09:00.473 --> 09:03.708
Oh, that's weird. It says
I have a call in progress.

09:03.709 --> 09:06.378
You probably sat on it
and butt-dialed someone.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.447
Hello?
Nobody there.

09:08.448 --> 09:10.549
- Must have gotten voicemail.
- Who'd you dial?

09:10.550 --> 09:12.584
Van Brundt.
Van Brundt!

09:12.585 --> 09:15.220
He's gonna hear everything
we just said about him!

09:15.221 --> 09:17.722
You mean he's going to hear
everything you just said about him.

09:17.723 --> 09:22.093
- We were both talking about him,
Emmett. - Stop saying my name!

09:22.094 --> 09:24.229
- And hang up the phone!
- Yes!

09:30.436 --> 09:32.304
- Hey!
- Hey.

09:32.305 --> 09:36.241
So did my evil plan work?
Did you butter up your mom?

09:36.242 --> 09:39.177
Like popcorn
at a midnight movie!

09:40.980 --> 09:43.482
What was that?

09:43.483 --> 09:46.718
Oh, it's just my phone. It's
always making weird noises.

09:46.719 --> 09:48.820
So how'd you do it?

09:48.821 --> 09:50.789
Oh, it was so painful.

09:50.790 --> 09:53.892
<i>I had to spend the whole day
with her pretending she was cool.</i>

09:53.893 --> 09:56.261
<i>Longest day of my life.</i>

09:56.262 --> 09:57.929
But it was all worth it

09:57.930 --> 10:01.132
Because we're going
to see "Dusk"!

10:02.635 --> 10:05.203
"When the sun goes down,
his fangs come out."

10:05.204 --> 10:08.907
And his shirt comes off!

10:21.824 --> 10:26.461
It was all just a big trick so Teddy could
get permission to see that vampire movie.

10:26.462 --> 10:30.865
Bob, she thinks I'm just as
uncool as I thought my mom was.

10:30.866 --> 10:35.437
It's the great
uncool circle of life.

10:35.438 --> 10:38.473
Well, honey, if it helps,
I think you're cool.

10:39.342 --> 10:41.676
It doesn't.

10:42.979 --> 10:45.413
All right, so what's the
punishment going to be?

10:45.414 --> 10:47.282
No movie,
grounded for a week?

10:48.283 --> 10:51.086
Too easy.

10:51.087 --> 10:54.155
Mama's going to get even.

10:54.156 --> 10:55.890
You know nothing good
ever happens

10:55.891 --> 10:57.926
When you start calling
yourself "mama."

10:57.927 --> 11:00.428
Mama doesn't care.

11:10.406 --> 11:11.940
There he is.

11:11.941 --> 11:15.243
Guess we should just go in
there and get it over with.

11:15.244 --> 11:17.579
Man, I hate
getting beat up.

11:17.580 --> 11:21.850
- You've been beat up before?
- No, but I've heard bad things.

11:21.851 --> 11:23.818
Hey, duncan, get in here!

11:29.892 --> 11:31.926
How are you doing
on our project?

11:31.927 --> 11:34.129
Okay.

11:35.931 --> 11:38.800
- That's all you wanted to talk about?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

11:38.801 --> 11:41.236
I love what you've
done with your hair.

11:42.838 --> 11:47.475
So... Heard any interesting
phone messages lately?

11:47.476 --> 11:52.147
No, mrs. Jeter caught me texting
in class and took my phone away.

11:52.148 --> 11:54.115
- Ohh.
- What?!

11:54.116 --> 11:57.719
That... that's terrible. Don't you hate
it when people just take your phone

11:57.720 --> 11:59.721
And put it... where exactly?

11:59.722 --> 12:03.792
It's in her desk. I'm getting
it back at the end of the day.

12:03.793 --> 12:05.694
I'm tired of talking!

12:10.766 --> 12:12.200
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:12.201 --> 12:13.968
Aren't you home from school
a little early?

12:13.969 --> 12:16.538
We've got a helicopter
to fly.

12:16.539 --> 12:18.339
And I'm only missing P.E.

12:18.340 --> 12:21.643
And english and math.

12:21.644 --> 12:24.179
All right, let's get
this bird in the air.

12:26.549 --> 12:29.551
- Whoa!
- How'd you do that?

12:29.552 --> 12:32.687
- I don't know.
- Is it voice-activated?

12:32.688 --> 12:36.624
Uh... Stop.

12:36.625 --> 12:39.127
Down!

12:39.128 --> 12:42.097
- No.
- Both: Whoa!

12:43.632 --> 12:45.600
You must have put it
together wrong.

12:45.601 --> 12:48.803
No no, that's impossible.
I followed all the instructions.

12:54.810 --> 12:58.079
- Where's the remote?
- I don't know!

13:07.356 --> 13:09.224
Oh, dad, do something!

13:09.225 --> 13:12.460
I am...
I'm making a run for it!

13:20.503 --> 13:22.570
Okay, the coast is clear.
Let's go.

13:22.571 --> 13:24.939
Just get the phone
and get out of here.

13:27.743 --> 13:29.177
Okay, I got it.
Let's go.

13:29.178 --> 13:31.379
<i>Oh, jeez!</i>

13:31.380 --> 13:33.348
- Here you go.
- What do you mean!?

13:33.349 --> 13:36.050
I don't know what to do.
Put it away.

13:38.320 --> 13:41.456
- That attitude better change, buddy.
- Yes, ma'am.

13:42.491 --> 13:44.592
What are you boys
doing in here?

13:44.593 --> 13:47.362
We had a chemistry question.

13:47.363 --> 13:50.198
- Which is?
- Ahem...

13:50.199 --> 13:52.400
We were wondering...

13:52.401 --> 13:54.769
What's boron made of.

13:54.770 --> 13:57.305
Boron.

13:57.306 --> 13:59.207
Told ya!

13:59.208 --> 14:01.943
Well, I stand corrected.

14:03.012 --> 14:05.146
Can I have
my phone now?

14:07.449 --> 14:09.317
Here you go.

14:11.287 --> 14:13.321
Wait a minute...
where's my phone?

14:15.224 --> 14:19.527
George, can I make a
quick call on your phone?

14:19.528 --> 14:21.429
Please?

14:21.430 --> 14:24.833
Thank you.

14:31.173 --> 14:34.509
- Whoops.
- What's wrong with you?

14:34.510 --> 14:36.511
I guess

14:36.512 --> 14:38.546
I'm the "boron" now.

14:38.547 --> 14:42.016
- You owe me a phone!
- Gladly.

14:44.320 --> 14:46.788
- Okay, P.J., let's go.
- Wait.

14:46.789 --> 14:50.625
Is that my phone ringing
in your pants?

14:56.365 --> 14:58.533
Hello?

14:58.534 --> 15:01.002
Hold on.
It's for you.

15:05.808 --> 15:09.377
I can't believe we're here!
This is like a dream.

15:09.378 --> 15:11.512
A dream where we get
to flirt with cute guys,

15:11.513 --> 15:13.481
Watch a movie
about cute guys

15:13.482 --> 15:16.050
While sitting
next to cute guys.

15:18.654 --> 15:22.790
The midnight showing
of "Dusk" is sold out.

15:28.664 --> 15:29.931
Oh no.

15:29.932 --> 15:31.766
- What?
- Look!

15:34.103 --> 15:36.871
- Hey, girlfriend!
- Hey hey.

15:36.872 --> 15:38.473
What are you
doing here?

15:38.474 --> 15:40.942
What am I doing? I'm
hanging out with my "bfd,"

15:40.943 --> 15:43.278
My best friend daughter.
Right?

15:43.279 --> 15:46.214
'cause that's what all the
cool moms do, right, Mary Lou?

15:46.215 --> 15:48.149
All night long!

15:48.150 --> 15:53.488
Whoo, Ivy! Isn't that randall,
the boy you think is soooo cute?

15:53.489 --> 15:55.990
- Mom, keep your voice down.
- Hey, randall,

15:55.991 --> 15:57.492
<i>This is my daughter Ivy.</i>

15:57.493 --> 16:01.195
She's single and loves
to mingle.

16:01.196 --> 16:03.498
Mary Lou!

16:03.499 --> 16:06.267
You're so cute.
Randall can't hear you.

16:06.268 --> 16:11.272
Hey, everybody! I'm amy
duncan, Teddy duncan's mom.

16:11.273 --> 16:15.310
And I'm Mary Lou Wentz
and this is my daughter Ivy.

16:15.311 --> 16:18.446
We're the cool moms.
Right, Teddy?

16:18.447 --> 16:22.450
Hit it, Mary Lou.

16:33.262 --> 16:35.563
- I can't look.
- Oh, good choice.

16:35.564 --> 16:39.300
Because right now they're
doing the usher bump.

16:53.182 --> 16:57.151
Okay, you did not say
a word the entire ride home.

16:57.152 --> 16:59.354
Out with it.

17:00.889 --> 17:02.724
You totally
embarrassed me tonight.

17:02.725 --> 17:05.626
Yeah, that was
kind of the idea.

17:06.528 --> 17:09.896
Look at me.

17:09.897 --> 17:12.532
Why? What did I ever do to you?

17:14.303 --> 17:17.605
You played me, Teddy.
You don't think I'm cool at all.

17:17.606 --> 17:19.040
Why... why would you
think that?

17:19.040 --> 17:21.309
Because I heard you say it.

17:21.310 --> 17:24.145
- When you butt-dialed me.
- I...

17:25.414 --> 17:27.281
Oh!

17:29.284 --> 17:31.919
Yeah, "oh".

17:38.427 --> 17:40.595
I don't know
what to say, mom.

17:43.065 --> 17:45.133
I'm sorry.

17:46.668 --> 17:48.870
That's a start.

17:48.871 --> 17:52.240
I should have never
done that. I feel awful.

17:52.241 --> 17:54.609
Now I'm feeling better.

17:57.446 --> 18:00.214
Well, do me a favor.
In the future

18:00.215 --> 18:02.116
When I do something stupid,

18:02.117 --> 18:04.919
Could you just ground me
like a normal mom?

18:04.920 --> 18:07.288
Oh, Teddy.

18:09.091 --> 18:12.727
I think we've established
I'll never be a normal mom.

18:30.412 --> 18:34.549
Van Brundt.
Hey, what's up?

18:34.550 --> 18:37.718
- Got a new phone.
- Oh, right, how much do I owe you?

18:37.719 --> 18:41.289
Do you know when you get a new phone
you can check your old messages?

18:43.125 --> 18:45.493
Well, that doesn't
sound right.

18:45.494 --> 18:48.863
I heard what you said about me.
All of it!

18:50.666 --> 18:53.901
- Okay, what are you going to do to us?
- I'm going to let you choose.

18:53.902 --> 18:56.204
- I made a list.
- Wow.

18:56.205 --> 18:58.973
You're pretty organized
for a bully.

19:01.510 --> 19:06.347
I don't mean to correct you,
but there's no "j" in gouge.

19:08.584 --> 19:12.453
Let's go with number five.
At least it's not painful.

19:12.454 --> 19:14.789
- Two number fives, please.
- Thank you.

19:27.236 --> 19:29.537
We butt-dialed
van Brundt.

19:31.240 --> 19:33.908
I didn't say stop.

19:39.681 --> 19:43.484
Okay, whirlybird,
this is your final mission.

19:43.485 --> 19:47.054
Take happy happy horse
far far away.

19:50.225 --> 19:53.828
Launch... three, two, one.

20:00.369 --> 20:02.069
<i>Yeah, it's going good.</i>

20:02.070 --> 20:04.305
No no.
No, whirlybird.

20:04.306 --> 20:06.407
Look out for
the power line, no!

20:13.048 --> 20:14.882
* I'm a happy happy horse *

20:14.883 --> 20:16.684
* happy happy
happy horse *

20:16.685 --> 20:18.319
* I'm a happy happy horse *

20:18.320 --> 20:20.221
* happy happy
happy horse *

20:22.024 --> 20:24.091
<i>- * I'm a happy
happy horse... *</i>

20:24.092 --> 20:25.793
<i>* happy happy happy horse *</i>

20:25.794 --> 20:27.929
<i>* I'm a happy
happy horse *</i>

20:27.930 --> 20:30.198
<i>* happy happy happy horse. *</i>

20:33.702 --> 20:36.337
Hey, Charlie, so...

20:36.338 --> 20:38.105
I have a little
advice for you.

20:38.106 --> 20:40.141
If you ever want
to fool a parent,

20:40.142 --> 20:43.177
And make them think they're cool,
dad is definitely the way to go.

20:43.178 --> 20:45.947
Just ask him about his job
and pretend you're interested.

20:45.948 --> 20:48.449
<i>Heard that. You're grounded.</i>

20:48.450 --> 20:50.818
Baby monitor!

20:50.819 --> 20:52.587
Stupid technology.

20:52.588 --> 20:54.121
<i>Heard that too.</i>

20:55.257 --> 20:57.191
Yeah, I can't even imagine

20:57.192 --> 21:00.061
What kind of gadgets they'll
have when you're a teenager, so...

21:00.062 --> 21:02.630
<i>Good luck, Charlie.</i>

21:04.233 --> 21:06.934
Hey, honey. Here we go.
Careful it's hot.

21:06.935 --> 21:10.638
I had a little quick
question to ask you.

21:10.639 --> 21:14.475
- Sure, mom, what's up? - Okay, I want
you just to be totally honest with me.

21:14.476 --> 21:17.311
I am cooler than
Mary Lou Wentz, right?

21:18.780 --> 21:21.882
Of course you are, mom.

21:21.883 --> 21:25.753
Now tell me the truth. I am
cooler than amy duncan, right?

21:25.754 --> 21:27.989
Definitely.

21:35.935 --> 21:37.870
<i>Hey, sweetheart.</i>

21:37.871 --> 21:39.904
<i>Yeah, I'm talking to you.</i>

21:39.905 --> 21:43.074
<i>Listen, we got a problem
with your brother.</i>

21:43.943 --> 21:46.078
<i>Not him,
the little one</i>

21:46.079 --> 21:48.480
<i>with the big mouth.</i>

21:49.883 --> 21:52.718
- You just talking with Charlie?
- What?

21:52.719 --> 21:55.187
Never mind.

21:56.656 --> 22:00.425
<i>Anyway, that little stinker
was trying to get rid of me.</i>

22:00.426 --> 22:03.061
<i>I say we
get rid of him.</i>

22:03.062 --> 22:04.563
<i>'cause that would make me...</i>

22:04.564 --> 22:05.898
* a happy happy horse *

22:05.899 --> 22:07.666
* happy happy
happy horse. *

22:11.237 --> 22:14.139
Stupid horse.

22:14.140 --> 22:16.074
<i>Watch your back, kid.</i>

22:20.780 --> 22:22.414
* I'm a happy happy horse *

22:22.415 --> 22:24.516
* happy happy
happy horse. *
