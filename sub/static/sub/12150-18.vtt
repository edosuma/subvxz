00:01.929 --> 00:02.979
Previously on Angel:

00:03.129 --> 00:05.129
None of us are ready just yet.

00:06.129 --> 00:09.039
I don't want you to work for me.
I'll work for you.

00:10.929 --> 00:13.699
Careful with that hand.
You might lose it.

00:15.130 --> 00:18.219
- Isn't that right?
- There's worse things to lose.

00:18.730 --> 00:20.410
They want Angel alive,

00:21.129 --> 00:24.320
Boo-hoo! Let me wipe my tears
with my plastic hand.

00:24.730 --> 00:27.500
If he won't play by the rules,
why should we?

00:56.369 --> 00:58.579
SIG alerts on the 405, 101 and 60,

00:59.369 --> 01:01.899
Better take a helicopter to work,

01:02.369 --> 01:06.090
Your L.A. weather today is sunny,
bright and beautiful,

01:48.569 --> 01:50.319
Am I a lucky guy or what?

01:51.290 --> 01:54.269
I get to meet with the board
and get the quarterlies out.

01:54.890 --> 01:56.959
- Morning, sweetie. Hungry?
- No time.

01:57.290 --> 01:59.010
Oh, have a muffin.

02:00.890 --> 02:02.430
Where's my sugar?

02:05.689 --> 02:08.810
- A manly handshake, huh? Come here.
- Dad.

02:09.288 --> 02:11.430
- We're late.
- I'll start the van.

02:11.689 --> 02:14.990
Jesse, take your vitamins in the car.
Hayley, homework.

02:15.770 --> 02:18.930
Come on, let's go.
Jesse, where are your books?

02:19.409 --> 02:21.550
- I got them.
- And the vitamins.

02:22.409 --> 02:24.620
I got them too. Just keep going.

02:26.610 --> 02:29.169
Come on, Dad. We're gonna be late!

02:33.810 --> 02:37.180
Cordelia. Cordelia! Cordy!
Get her some water.

02:39.849 --> 02:41.110
What is it?

02:45.849 --> 02:47.319
What'd you see?

03:53.849 --> 03:57.360
- How about Western Pacific Power?
- There's threat of investigation.

03:58.050 --> 04:01.139
That's why I was asking.
Where are we with them?

04:01.650 --> 04:04.629
We can tie it up.
They won't miss a dividend.

04:05.849 --> 04:09.110
They've already looted
3.5 billion since deregulation.

04:09.449 --> 04:12.120
Are you suggesting
our clients admit that?

04:13.050 --> 04:16.560
Great idea. They can go to jail
and pay us how?

04:17.250 --> 04:21.819
Litigation is bad PR.
If they refund half a billion...

04:22.649 --> 04:26.019
...we take 20 percent off the top.
Everybody wins.

04:26.850 --> 04:30.709
I'll consider both options.
And the current status of Angel?

04:31.649 --> 04:35.339
He's up, he's down.
He's a barrel of dead monkeys.

04:35.850 --> 04:39.329
He's back with his group.
Sources say he's doing better.

04:40.050 --> 04:43.459
He's not spending all of his time
on the warpath...

04:44.250 --> 04:45.689
...trying to kill...

04:46.050 --> 04:47.170
...well, us.

04:50.850 --> 04:53.730
When do you and Lindsey
meet with Lycor's CFO?

04:53.850 --> 04:56.269
- Oh, I think it's--
- Thursday at 11.

04:57.449 --> 05:01.170
Good. Friday, we'll be
re-evaluating your division.

05:02.850 --> 05:04.360
You can catch me up then.

05:05.250 --> 05:06.439
Let's get to work.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.850
Could you stab me in my back
a little deeper?

05:20.250 --> 05:24.529
You know what re-evaluation means.
One of us gets cut.

05:25.050 --> 05:28.839
- Here, that's a literal cutting.
- Nothing lasts forever.

05:29.850 --> 05:33.819
- That's deep. Why don't you go f--?
- Lindsey, join me?

05:44.850 --> 05:47.689
Some advice about your
attitude towards Angel.

05:49.050 --> 05:52.629
Now, I realize what he did
to you was heartless.

05:53.250 --> 05:56.439
Naturally, your attitude
towards him would be complex.

05:56.850 --> 06:00.680
But it's not professional to air
feelings around colleagues.

06:01.649 --> 06:04.069
People look up to you.

06:05.850 --> 06:09.680
Which reminds me,
I made an appointment for you today.

06:10.050 --> 06:12.889
It'll take a while,
so I cleared your calendar.

06:13.649 --> 06:16.529
Yes. Well, just a....

06:17.850 --> 06:18.930
Well, you'll see.

06:20.129 --> 06:24.170
He had to be crazy.
But he didn't feel crazy.

06:24.930 --> 06:26.649
He felt normal, you know?

06:27.329 --> 06:30.660
- Until he stabbed himself.
- Where did this occur?

06:31.529 --> 06:34.550
I told you, it was in a house.
It could've been...

06:35.129 --> 06:36.500
...an apartment, in a kitchen.

06:36.930 --> 06:39.629
- Narrow it down.
- A nice kitchen? I don't--

06:40.529 --> 06:43.759
- We'll figure it out.
- Start by calling the hospitals.

06:44.129 --> 06:46.519
What? "Did my uncle stab
a knife in his eye?"

06:47.129 --> 06:49.339
They only give information
to relatives.

06:51.329 --> 06:54.100
- I got the hospitals job.
- I'll go to the morgues.

06:54.329 --> 06:57.560
- I'll see if there's a new terror.
- Good idea.

06:59.129 --> 07:01.019
- Keep an eye on her.
- Sure.

07:02.730 --> 07:03.990
We'll be back.

07:07.529 --> 07:09.490
Can I get you anything? Cup of tea?

07:12.329 --> 07:14.079
You let me know.

07:29.129 --> 07:32.569
Lindsey. I'm Dr. Melman.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

07:33.329 --> 07:34.339
Hi.

07:37.529 --> 07:41.250
Your vitals are good. You've had
all the childhood diseases...

07:41.730 --> 07:43.449
...and you're not allergic.

07:44.129 --> 07:46.620
Let's start with
two milligrams of Versed.

07:47.129 --> 07:49.870
A little something to relax you
before we begin.

07:50.730 --> 07:53.750
- Have any questions?
- What the hell's going on?

07:54.329 --> 07:55.939
- Your boss didn't say?
- No.

07:56.730 --> 08:00.449
- They have a funny sense of humor.
- They keep us hopping.

08:00.930 --> 08:03.250
Your firm is a major source
of our funding.

08:03.930 --> 08:06.420
We see most of you
for your primary care...

08:06.930 --> 08:09.839
...but there are some
less publicized aspects.

08:10.529 --> 08:14.360
- What the hell are you gonna do?
- Please, don't be alarmed.

08:15.329 --> 08:19.579
They moved you to the top
of the transplant list.

08:21.329 --> 08:24.769
- Transplant?
- Yes, your hand.

08:25.529 --> 08:28.509
We're gonna give you a new one.

08:31.529 --> 08:34.200
Don't be so nervous.
This is cause for applause.

08:34.529 --> 08:38.080
In just a few hours' time,
you'll be doing the applauding.

08:41.730 --> 08:44.429
- Let's go.
- Get the soft tissue ready.

08:46.529 --> 08:50.669
- Here you go. 4.0 silk.
- Connecting the extensors.

08:51.929 --> 08:55.190
You're doing great, Lindsey.
Where's the Pockla?

08:56.129 --> 08:59.960
Release the tourniquet.
I'm waiting on the Pockla.

09:01.529 --> 09:02.399
Here it comes.

09:29.129 --> 09:30.919
Okay, let's get him to post-op.

09:33.769 --> 09:35.590
My father's name is Henry Addison.

09:36.769 --> 09:40.070
Yeah, I'm his son, Gunn. Ter.
Gunter Addison.

09:40.970 --> 09:45.080
But if he's had a manic episode,
he might not know his name.

09:45.769 --> 09:48.190
It'd be a serious knife
wound in his eye.

09:48.769 --> 09:52.840
- You sure? All right, thanks.
- How's she doing?

09:56.570 --> 10:01.210
She grunted once around noon, then
got on with the maniacal cleaning.

10:03.169 --> 10:06.789
Guess what I found? More nothing
than usual. How about you?

10:09.169 --> 10:12.120
- Nothing.
- We need more to go on.

10:12.769 --> 10:15.679
We'll just have to talk
to Cordelia, get her to--

10:16.370 --> 10:18.330
Dig a little deeper?

10:19.370 --> 10:21.120
Go ahead. Best not to crowd her.

10:21.769 --> 10:23.799
You're the one in charge now.

10:24.769 --> 10:29.269
You're right. That's why
I'm assigning this one to you.

10:40.970 --> 10:42.580
Hey.

10:45.769 --> 10:49.029
Boy, you could see your reflection
in that glass.

10:49.370 --> 10:52.000
I couldn't because of
the vampire situation.

10:52.370 --> 10:55.110
- But a normal person....
- What do you want?

10:57.169 --> 10:59.730
We need help.
We're not getting anywhere.

11:01.370 --> 11:05.090
I'm sorry. He's probably dead by now.

11:06.169 --> 11:10.240
We don't know that for sure.
There could be others.

11:11.570 --> 11:13.850
I wish it would stop hurting.

11:16.370 --> 11:18.580
What do you want me to do?

11:19.970 --> 11:21.509
Not exactly sure.

11:22.970 --> 11:26.830
Maybe you can look again.
You know, inside.

11:28.370 --> 11:31.559
That's all I've been doing, all day.

11:39.169 --> 11:40.679
That guy in the kitchen.

11:42.169 --> 11:43.399
A normal guy...

11:45.769 --> 11:47.870
...and he picks up a knife.

11:49.370 --> 11:50.240
And--

11:54.769 --> 11:57.580
Oh, God! I think he had kids.

11:58.970 --> 12:02.659
- How do you know that?
- Cereal bowls on the table.

12:03.169 --> 12:05.100
And there was a book bag.

12:09.769 --> 12:12.049
It has a name of a school on it.

12:12.769 --> 12:16.769
D-something. Delaney or....

12:17.570 --> 12:19.250
Delancey School.

12:19.970 --> 12:22.220
That's good, that's great.

12:23.570 --> 12:24.940
Anything else?

12:28.970 --> 12:30.230
I just keep seeing it.

12:30.769 --> 12:33.889
Get some rest.
Wesley and Gunn will look into it.

12:37.970 --> 12:42.250
- Can I get you anything?
- Why does everyone ask me that?

12:42.769 --> 12:44.700
No reason.

13:12.649 --> 13:14.330
She's still rocking,

13:15.049 --> 13:19.120
We've got weather and traffic coming,
so keep it right here,

14:01.250 --> 14:04.620
- Good to see you. Pleasure.
- One of our finest.

14:06.049 --> 14:08.649
- Here's Lilah Morgan. Mr. Kraigle.
- Nice to see you.

14:09.649 --> 14:10.730
Use my office.

14:10.850 --> 14:14.610
Irv, call me if you need anything.
You're in good hands.

14:15.649 --> 14:17.090
- Thanks.
- Mr. Kraigle.

14:17.450 --> 14:19.240
- Please, call me Irv.
- Thank you.

14:19.850 --> 14:22.899
That's an expensive operation,
quarter mil.

14:23.450 --> 14:25.769
I guess they like you.
They really like you.

14:26.450 --> 14:29.330
- He's waiting.
- You think you have it in the bag.

14:30.049 --> 14:31.840
I don't think anything, Lilah.

14:32.450 --> 14:36.659
You're the one in pain here?
I can't believe they chose you.

14:37.850 --> 14:40.899
- We didn't do anything wrong,
- It's not about that.

14:41.450 --> 14:43.700
It's about what a jury may award.

14:44.450 --> 14:45.850
Cancer from chocolate? How?

14:46.250 --> 14:48.879
Sell it in a tin
that leaches cytoclistomene.

14:49.250 --> 14:52.899
But how could we know that?
The Chinese sold us the tin.

14:53.450 --> 14:57.139
Don't worry. If a jury ever
hears this, and that's a big "if"...

14:58.250 --> 15:01.340
...they'll be handpicked
or enchanted by us.

15:01.850 --> 15:05.919
Why can't people take responsibility?
The Chinese gave them cancer.

15:07.250 --> 15:09.879
- Actually, it was the Drizon Company.
- Who?

15:10.250 --> 15:14.039
It's a corporation that split
from your company six years ago.

15:15.049 --> 15:17.750
They're responsible
for the tin containers...

15:18.049 --> 15:20.080
...your company fills with chocolate.

15:22.250 --> 15:25.159
- Really?
- The plaintiffs want to sue Drizon.

15:25.850 --> 15:28.129
But they're going bankrupt
this summer.

15:31.250 --> 15:32.299
Are you getting this?

15:41.450 --> 15:45.419
- He's good, isn't he?
- Yeah, he's great.

15:56.850 --> 15:59.549
Well, this is very helpful.
Very comforting.

16:00.450 --> 16:02.309
We're not doing anything unlawful?

16:02.850 --> 16:05.899
No. More importantly,
we're preserving your company.

16:06.450 --> 16:07.850
I have to go.

16:08.850 --> 16:12.820
- Something wrong?
- No. No, nothing is wrong.

17:09.848 --> 17:11.809
Who are you?

17:14.009 --> 17:15.799
Thanks, keep the change.

17:16.410 --> 17:20.098
A whole dollar just for me.
I'm the luckiest delivery man....

17:26.608 --> 17:29.000
- What's all this?
- Lunch. I was hungry.

17:32.009 --> 17:33.269
You don't eat food.

17:33.809 --> 17:36.759
It doesn't keep me alive,
but I get a hankering.

17:37.410 --> 17:40.359
For turkey, ham
and roast beef sandwiches?

17:41.009 --> 17:42.619
You missed the vegetarian.

17:43.410 --> 17:46.079
Soup and salad too?
What is going on here?

17:46.410 --> 17:49.529
- I forgot what you liked.
- Why didn't you ask me?

17:50.609 --> 17:52.539
You said, why does everyone...

17:53.009 --> 17:55.430
...ask if they can get you anything?

17:56.009 --> 17:58.039
So you did this instead?

17:59.009 --> 18:00.799
Yeah.

18:02.009 --> 18:04.039
I love you.

18:05.009 --> 18:06.519
You ought to do that more.

18:07.410 --> 18:09.619
- Buy you food?
- Smile.

18:12.210 --> 18:13.680
What?

18:15.210 --> 18:17.069
Okay, this is weird.

18:17.609 --> 18:19.819
Before he put the knife in his eye...

18:20.009 --> 18:22.180
...he was happy about his eye.

18:23.009 --> 18:25.400
- Like it was new or something.
- New.

18:26.009 --> 18:27.829
We found him. Joseph Kramer.

18:28.410 --> 18:31.289
Has two kids.
They go to the Delancey School.

18:32.009 --> 18:33.210
Kids didn't show up.

18:33.210 --> 18:35.380
Mom called.
Said she's taking them away.

18:36.210 --> 18:38.630
Their father supposedly
got a promotion.

18:39.210 --> 18:41.349
- Get a home address?
- We've been there.

18:41.609 --> 18:43.609
- And?
- No trace of belongings.

18:44.009 --> 18:47.099
The place had been cleaned.
The carpet was still wet.

18:48.210 --> 18:49.400
To get rid of the blood.

18:49.410 --> 18:51.480
Little piece of molding they missed.

18:52.410 --> 18:54.660
- Wanna sniff?
- How about I just believe you?

18:54.809 --> 18:56.670
- What do we know?
- Nothing.

18:57.210 --> 18:58.680
Guy's gone, family's gone.

18:59.009 --> 19:02.519
Someone has the power to make
them all disappear in a day.

19:03.210 --> 19:06.019
- We're at a dead end.
- I thought we had more.

19:06.809 --> 19:08.839
There's only one thing we can do.

19:10.410 --> 19:12.339
Oh, God. Oh, no.

19:12.809 --> 19:15.059
- The karaoke bar.
- Angel's gonna sing?

19:16.410 --> 19:18.690
- Isn't there another way?
- There has to be.

19:19.410 --> 19:20.740
Hey, what?

19:24.809 --> 19:28.880
Pretty girl on every corner

19:30.210 --> 19:34.390
Sunshine turns the sky to gold

19:35.009 --> 19:38.660
Warm, warm, it's always warm here

19:41.009 --> 19:44.099
And I can't take the cold

19:45.210 --> 19:47.170
You should pick something short.

19:48.210 --> 19:51.759
- "Stairway to Heaven"?
- Don't even joke about that.

19:53.009 --> 19:55.680
- Oh, my God, look who's--
- Lindsey?

19:59.609 --> 20:00.519
Isn't he fabulous?

20:00.809 --> 20:01.680
He comes here?

20:02.009 --> 20:06.190
He came a lot, before someone
chopped off his strumming hand.

20:07.410 --> 20:09.200
Looks like he's got a new one.

20:09.809 --> 20:11.980
She's pretty as a picture

20:12.809 --> 20:15.720
Wow! He's good.

20:16.410 --> 20:17.880
Lawyer's got some pipes.

20:19.410 --> 20:22.079
Fills me with love and laughter

20:22.410 --> 20:24.269
- You think he's good?
- Shh.

20:24.809 --> 20:27.019
I can't feel a thing

20:30.210 --> 20:33.470
The sky's gonna open

20:33.809 --> 20:36.859
People gonna pray and crawl

20:41.009 --> 20:43.920
What is that? Rock? Country? Ballad?
Pick a style.

20:44.609 --> 20:47.490
- Shh.
- Don't make me ask you to leave.

20:50.009 --> 20:53.339
The sky's gonna open

20:54.210 --> 20:58.039
People gonna pray and sing

21:00.210 --> 21:04.069
I can't feel

21:12.210 --> 21:14.630
- I can't sing now.
- You won't have to.

21:18.809 --> 21:21.369
Sure is good to have you back
in the saddle.

21:21.809 --> 21:23.880
Your favorite, TNT.

21:24.210 --> 21:27.089
I got a crazy man's hand
who wants to kill someone...

21:27.809 --> 21:29.420
...maybe me.
What do you see?

21:30.210 --> 21:32.880
Well, the hand is quicker
than the eye.

21:33.210 --> 21:35.240
- You'll get that later.
- I need help.

21:35.609 --> 21:38.799
I'll say. You might want
to start with the singing.

21:40.410 --> 21:43.359
Hi. You probably don't remember me.
Cordelia.

21:44.009 --> 21:48.259
I know you're evil and everything
but that was just so amazing.

21:49.410 --> 21:50.950
- That was tight.
- Terrific.

21:51.210 --> 21:52.289
Is everyone drunk?

21:52.410 --> 21:54.660
What's he doing here?
What are you looking at?

21:55.410 --> 21:59.730
I don't allow violence in here.
Angel's here for the reason you are.

22:00.210 --> 22:02.279
- How's that?
- Two enemies, one case.

22:03.210 --> 22:05.349
Coming together in a beautiful way.

22:05.609 --> 22:09.259
- They're working together on this?
- Work with him? With him?

22:09.809 --> 22:12.900
- Did anyone see 48 Hours?
- I got a murderous hand...

22:14.009 --> 22:16.180
...and you're teaming me up with
the guy who cut mine off?

22:16.410 --> 22:20.980
I'm telling you what's what, sugar.
What you do with it is up to you.

22:27.210 --> 22:30.829
If I ever see you outside the club,
I'm gonna kill you.

22:32.609 --> 22:36.230
Resentment's an ugly emotion.
I hope you've overcome yours.

22:37.410 --> 22:39.759
Right now, he has your case in the...

22:40.410 --> 22:44.170
...forgive me, palm of his hand. Toodles.

22:44.609 --> 22:47.380
If he's the lead,
shouldn't we follow him?

22:48.210 --> 22:51.230
The guy in your vision got an eye,
and Lindsey got a hand.

22:51.809 --> 22:54.160
We should find where
the transplants were done.

22:54.809 --> 22:59.380
- So we're following him, right?
- We need to follow his new hand.

23:03.210 --> 23:05.309
I wonder who it belonged to.

24:31.049 --> 24:33.650
Hand belongs to a white male,
Bradley Scott.

24:34.049 --> 24:37.240
Served two years for embezzlement.
Paroled last month.

24:38.250 --> 24:39.720
- How'd you find out?
- I'm a detective.

24:40.049 --> 24:42.470
- Did he have a life?
- Why don't you look--?

24:43.049 --> 24:44.309
I am.

24:44.849 --> 24:46.049
Impressive, Angel.

24:46.049 --> 24:48.819
Well, sometimes you gotta
follow your--

24:49.650 --> 24:52.559
So how did your--?
Get you into the NCIC?

24:53.250 --> 24:56.440
- The what?
- National Crime and Information Center.

24:56.849 --> 24:59.130
Long story.
How's it coming over there?

24:59.849 --> 25:00.900
We got time.

25:01.049 --> 25:04.210
Nobody used to question
my methods or my singing.

25:05.250 --> 25:06.410
You're half right.

25:06.450 --> 25:08.980
I hired a private detective.
He's got a friend.

25:10.049 --> 25:12.819
- We're private detectives.
- We have friends.

25:13.650 --> 25:15.579
We did. She got fired.
Get over it.

25:16.049 --> 25:17.380
Bradley Scott.

25:17.849 --> 25:21.500
While dumping bearer bonds
on the black market, he worked...

25:22.049 --> 25:24.470
- ...at Wolfram & Hart.
- Is he still alive?

25:25.049 --> 25:28.980
His records say he reported to his
parole officer, then disappeared.

25:29.849 --> 25:34.200
He gets out of jail, then-- Whack!
They give his hand to Lindsey.

25:35.250 --> 25:37.319
They really wanna give him everything.

26:28.650 --> 26:30.369
- Who is it?
- You don't know me.

26:31.049 --> 26:34.309
My name's Lindsey McDonald.
I work for Wolfram & Hart.

26:41.849 --> 26:43.990
- What do you want?
- To talk to you.

26:44.849 --> 26:46.250
Can I come in?

26:54.450 --> 26:56.549
Oh, it's okay. I'm alone.

26:58.650 --> 27:01.769
Professional habit.
I see a lot of lowlifes.

27:02.250 --> 27:05.900
I guess so, being a parole officer.
This is off the record.

27:07.049 --> 27:09.650
I had a procedure done
at Fairfield Clinic.

27:10.049 --> 27:13.140
They've paid you to do things
for them in the past.

27:14.250 --> 27:17.730
I need to find out
where they get their body parts.

27:18.450 --> 27:20.410
- What's the code?
- Code?

27:20.849 --> 27:23.309
If you're with Wolfram & Hart,
you know it.

27:23.849 --> 27:26.170
I'm a lawyer there
but this isn't my case.

27:26.250 --> 27:28.849
I don't know the code.
I can pay you--

27:38.250 --> 27:40.349
Tell me what the game is.

27:40.650 --> 27:43.559
It's no game, all right?
This is about me.

27:44.250 --> 27:45.119
Goodbye.

27:49.650 --> 27:51.609
- Friend of yours?
- No, he's not.

27:52.049 --> 27:55.670
I'm about to put a bullet
in your buddy's brain here!

27:56.250 --> 27:58.039
I got him. I know I got him.

28:02.250 --> 28:04.210
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life?

28:05.250 --> 28:07.210
- I don't need you!
- Watch that!

28:07.650 --> 28:10.529
- A little gratitude.
- You got no business--

28:11.250 --> 28:13.990
- Why aren't you trying to kill me?
- I'm on a case.

28:14.250 --> 28:16.250
Why is it always about killing you?

28:16.650 --> 28:19.000
You guys got issues, so I'll just--

28:19.650 --> 28:21.400
You're choking my lead!

28:22.049 --> 28:24.119
"My lead!"
Are we on a schoolyard?

28:24.450 --> 28:26.869
You gotta learn how
to play with others.

28:27.450 --> 28:31.349
I'm gonna loosen the rope.
Tell me all about Bradley Scott.

28:32.250 --> 28:34.809
- Who?
- Guy whose hand you got. Listen up.

28:35.250 --> 28:37.420
- Don't tell me what to do.
- So immature.

28:38.250 --> 28:39.369
Shut up!

28:39.450 --> 28:42.609
- We're waiting.
- I'm not telling you zip.

28:43.049 --> 28:45.329
You can kill me.
Wolfram & Hart will do worse.

28:46.049 --> 28:47.059
Kill you?

28:47.250 --> 28:51.079
Why would I kill you
when I could live off you for a month?

28:54.450 --> 28:57.220
- Can't you taste the butterfat?
- You're gross.

28:57.450 --> 29:00.079
I'll tell you!
Scott stole some bearer bonds.

29:01.049 --> 29:04.099
When he got paroled,
Wolfram & Hart assigned him to me.

29:04.650 --> 29:07.390
Your file says he was a no-show.
But you saw him.

29:08.250 --> 29:10.210
- Once.
- You took him to Fairfield Clinic?

29:10.650 --> 29:11.730
No, not there.

29:12.450 --> 29:14.269
- Where?
- Just some address.

29:15.450 --> 29:18.470
I don't know what they do there
and I don't wanna know.

29:32.490 --> 29:35.609
Her vision hangovers
are getting longer and longer.

29:36.089 --> 29:38.119
She can't rest until it's done.

29:38.490 --> 29:42.000
I know. She inherited them from Doyle.
He was half-demon.

29:42.690 --> 29:45.289
I' m not sure the human body
can carry....

29:46.289 --> 29:49.269
Last year, a demon unleashed a slew
of visions on her.

29:49.890 --> 29:51.990
She wound up in hospital,
out of her mind.

29:52.890 --> 29:55.940
She's been a little cranky lately,
but she's not...

29:56.490 --> 29:59.680
Angel, where are you?
I can't hear you.

30:00.089 --> 30:02.019
- ...crazy.
- Are you there?

30:06.690 --> 30:08.900
Nothing. I'm fine.

30:09.690 --> 30:13.900
Gunn and Wesley are playing with
the doors. I'm trying to work here.

30:16.890 --> 30:18.779
Okay, we'll wait here.

30:21.089 --> 30:24.250
I'm fine. Just get it done.

30:30.730 --> 30:33.009
Funny thing happened the other day.

30:33.730 --> 30:36.960
A guy sticks a butcher knife
in his own eye.

30:37.930 --> 30:40.029
Guess he went to the same clinic.

30:40.329 --> 30:44.369
Your hand hasn't been doing
anything funny lately, has it?

30:47.529 --> 30:50.829
It's none of my business,
but you don't seem happy.

30:51.130 --> 30:52.740
I know you're Mr. Save-a-Soul.

30:53.529 --> 30:56.200
You used to fight with your enemies.

30:56.529 --> 30:59.970
I guess it's a lot to carry.
I mean, losing Darla.

31:00.730 --> 31:04.980
I mean, even me, in a way,
as a place to focus your rage.

31:06.730 --> 31:09.990
It's ironic. I mean, here you are,
young and healthy...

31:10.329 --> 31:12.259
...good job, new hand.

31:13.930 --> 31:16.349
The more you get, the less you have.

31:17.529 --> 31:19.319
Am I getting through here?

31:19.329 --> 31:21.960
You just keep on moping.
You're good at that.

31:30.730 --> 31:32.690
Okay. That where you took him?

31:37.930 --> 31:39.259
- Know this place?
- No.

31:39.730 --> 31:42.289
I'm thinking security
will be top drawer.

31:42.730 --> 31:45.259
Window sensors,
motion detectors, guards.

31:45.730 --> 31:47.869
- I don't have my laptop.
- Huh?

31:48.730 --> 31:51.569
To hack into the system
and break the codes--

31:51.730 --> 31:55.309
Wait a minute. That's a bother.
Why don't we just fight?

31:57.730 --> 31:59.759
You might want to step aside.

32:04.329 --> 32:06.890
Come on, work off some
of that aggression.

32:23.529 --> 32:25.250
The floor is hollow.

32:49.930 --> 32:51.650
What is this?

32:52.329 --> 32:55.950
You know what this is.
Spare parts for guys like you.

32:57.730 --> 32:59.240
You got your "before"...

33:02.529 --> 33:04.140
...and your "after."

33:10.930 --> 33:13.599
More like "during," I guess.

33:14.529 --> 33:18.250
Your firm in action, Lindsey.
Lot to be proud of, huh?

33:25.329 --> 33:27.400
Pockla blessed this place.

33:27.730 --> 33:29.730
- Who are they?
- Demon healers.

33:30.130 --> 33:32.450
They know how to regenerate flesh.

33:33.130 --> 33:35.690
That's why the transplants
aren't taking well.

33:36.130 --> 33:38.970
One was there
when they gave me my hand.

33:39.730 --> 33:43.380
Your hand? I think it belonged
to that guy over there.

33:51.130 --> 33:53.230
Or what's left of him, anyway.

33:54.130 --> 33:57.920
Oh, God. I know him.

33:59.529 --> 34:01.559
I didn't get the name before.

34:08.530 --> 34:10.809
We worked in the mailroom together.

34:12.130 --> 34:13.000
Brad.

34:14.530 --> 34:16.000
Kill.

34:17.530 --> 34:19.110
Kill.

34:19.929 --> 34:22.809
Kill who? Huh?
Who do you want to kill?

34:23.530 --> 34:26.760
Kill me.

34:37.050 --> 34:38.630
Please.

34:40.650 --> 34:42.300
What am I supposed to do?

34:42.449 --> 34:45.119
I know what I'd do,
but this is your deal.

34:46.050 --> 34:47.630
Whatever it is, do it quick.

34:48.449 --> 34:51.500
They're gonna come in force.
We gotta help them.

35:00.449 --> 35:01.960
I'm sorry.

35:30.449 --> 35:32.309
Help these people upstairs.

35:41.849 --> 35:43.289
Get them to the car.

36:03.289 --> 36:05.219
How's everything in your head?

36:05.690 --> 36:06.599
What?

36:08.090 --> 36:09.460
Any vision aftermaths?

36:12.289 --> 36:13.480
It's better.

36:14.090 --> 36:15.070
What?

36:18.889 --> 36:21.980
It's just-- They're starting
to take a toll.

36:26.090 --> 36:27.949
It's part of the job, right?

36:31.530 --> 36:34.369
These re-evaluations
are a mixed blessing.

36:35.130 --> 36:37.199
Sad, as we lose one of our own.

36:37.530 --> 36:41.219
But also hopeful,
as we promote one of our own.

36:42.929 --> 36:46.829
Lilah, you have made a lot
of great contributions...

36:47.730 --> 36:49.199
...and you've tried your best--

36:49.530 --> 36:50.510
No!

36:50.730 --> 36:53.050
Lilah, please.

36:54.329 --> 36:56.010
They chose me.

36:59.130 --> 37:00.739
I'm clearly the guy.

37:01.530 --> 37:03.110
Yes, you are.

37:06.329 --> 37:07.869
You could have had it.

37:11.130 --> 37:13.090
You didn't have what it takes.

37:15.929 --> 37:18.670
An evil hand. I mean, come on.

37:19.530 --> 37:23.780
Who here does, huh? Leon doesn't.
Charlie doesn't.

37:24.929 --> 37:26.860
You know you gave me
an evil hand?

37:27.929 --> 37:30.250
I've been writing "kill"
on everything.

37:30.929 --> 37:32.730
It's crazy.
Anything could happen.

37:32.730 --> 37:34.170
- Allan.
- Allan, how are you?

37:38.730 --> 37:41.500
It's gonna hurt in the morning!
Come here.

37:41.730 --> 37:43.940
Stop it, evil hand. Stop it!

37:47.730 --> 37:49.829
I just can't control my evil hand.

37:50.730 --> 37:54.869
Nathan, I'm so proud
that you chose me. Charlie!

37:55.530 --> 37:57.699
But if I was in your shoes...

37:58.530 --> 38:00.949
...I would've chosen Lilah.
You know why?

38:01.530 --> 38:04.300
Do you have any idea
the hours she's logged in?

38:05.130 --> 38:07.449
The files she has on you guys?

38:07.530 --> 38:10.369
Deep stuff.
Ronnie, your stock manipulations.

38:11.130 --> 38:12.880
Nathan's offshore accounts.

38:13.530 --> 38:17.989
Can you imagine if those files
got back to the senior partners?

38:18.929 --> 38:20.440
They'd eat you alive!

38:23.130 --> 38:24.920
She's been working overtime.

38:25.530 --> 38:28.550
She's all you ever dreamed of.
Lilah is your guy.

38:29.130 --> 38:30.360
Me?

38:31.530 --> 38:35.039
I'm unreliable.
I got these evil-hand issues...

38:35.730 --> 38:37.760
...and I'm bored with this crap.

38:38.730 --> 38:41.500
Besides, I'm leaving,
so if you wanna chase me...

38:42.329 --> 38:45.630
...be my guest.
But remember. Evil.

38:47.730 --> 38:48.989
Charlie.

38:49.530 --> 38:51.110
Good luck.

38:53.730 --> 38:55.170
Evil.

38:59.730 --> 39:02.500
Well, let's amend the minutes.

39:02.730 --> 39:05.500
Lilah Morgan was promoted.

39:06.929 --> 39:10.440
And someone call an ambulance.

39:31.010 --> 39:33.329
If you're here to kill me, get in line.

39:34.610 --> 39:38.650
I really like this truck.
'56, right?

39:39.409 --> 39:41.900
First year they had
wraparound windshields.

39:42.409 --> 39:46.550
Back in the '50s, we all thought life
would be like The Jetsons now.

39:47.809 --> 39:52.380
Air cars, robots. I'd love to have
an air car. Wouldn't that be cool?

39:53.809 --> 39:55.769
You're gonna talk me to death?

39:56.210 --> 39:59.369
Things don't always
work out like you think.

39:59.809 --> 40:03.670
I bet Wolfram & Hart aren't happy
losing one of their best.

40:04.610 --> 40:06.889
Let them try to stop me.
It'll be fun.

40:07.610 --> 40:10.070
Is that a healthy attitude?

40:10.610 --> 40:12.539
Where are you going, Lindsey?

40:13.610 --> 40:14.840
Back to your roots?

40:15.409 --> 40:17.199
Something like that.

40:19.610 --> 40:22.489
Hope you're not waiting for me
to say I learned a lesson.

40:23.210 --> 40:25.010
That now I see the light--

40:25.010 --> 40:27.820
If you say that, I'd have to kill you.

40:28.610 --> 40:32.230
No. I'm just here to say bon voyage.

40:32.809 --> 40:34.320
Don't come back.

40:37.610 --> 40:42.179
To L.A.? No.
You can have this place.

40:43.610 --> 40:46.590
Good. Glad I didn't have
to do something immature.

40:52.610 --> 40:54.469
The key to Wolfram & Hart...

40:55.010 --> 40:57.219
...don't let them make you play
their game.

40:58.010 --> 40:59.690
Make them play yours.

41:01.010 --> 41:03.570
Thanks. I'll keep that in mind.

41:06.409 --> 41:09.530
Don't drive too fast, now.
Lot of cops out there.
