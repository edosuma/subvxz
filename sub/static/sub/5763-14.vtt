WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:04.800
Please, not you!

00:04.800 --> 00:07.300
- You have to cross over. - I don't want to.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.600
I saw Jim's ghost step into Sam's body.

00:11.600 --> 00:12.740
You're back!

00:12.800 --> 00:14.070
Do I know you?

00:14.140 --> 00:16.000
Look,I see the same guy that you see...

00:16.070 --> 00:17.440
Different hair, nose,eyes,

00:17.500 --> 00:19.040
It's not Jim.

00:19.100 --> 00:21.300
He's in there somewhere. He just has to be.

00:21.370 --> 00:22.540
You're not going to tell me

00:22.600 --> 00:23.540
You think I'm your husband reincarnated.

00:23.600 --> 00:24.800
Because you're the only sane person

00:24.870 --> 00:26.540
I've met since I woke up.

00:26.600 --> 00:27.870
It's not much, but maybe

00:27.870 --> 00:29.140
you could help me finish my garage,

00:29.200 --> 00:30.800
And you could live there while you do the work,

00:30.870 --> 00:32.369
Just until you figure out your next move.

00:32.439 --> 00:34.640
Oh,my god,it's true. You don't know who I am,do you?

00:34.700 --> 00:35.870
You must be Nicole.

00:35.940 --> 00:37.120
The fiance?

00:37.120 --> 00:39.440
She is not his fiance until he puts a ring on her finger.

00:39.500 --> 00:40.800
Bye.

00:43.200 --> 00:44.470
Bye.

00:58.140 --> 01:00.770
You mean,Nikki really left? Just like that?

01:00.840 --> 01:02.070
Yeah. I still can't believe it.

01:02.140 --> 01:04.099
And so after she drove away, then what happened?

01:04.170 --> 01:06.485
Well,it was...

01:06.485 --> 01:08.800
intense.

01:08.870 --> 01:12.740
We just stood there, staring at each other.

01:15.940 --> 01:17.000
That really happens?

01:17.070 --> 01:17.770
I'm telling you,

01:17.840 --> 01:20.670
It was like everything around us just dropped away,

01:20.740 --> 01:23.670
You know? As if there was some kind of...

01:23.740 --> 01:26.740
magnetic field drawing us together

01:26.800 --> 01:28.100
As though...

01:28.170 --> 01:31.070
nothing could stop what was about to happen.

01:31.140 --> 01:33.170
So?! what happened?

01:33.240 --> 01:35.140
I called you.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.070
Really? Please.

01:37.140 --> 01:38.940
Well,I didn't know what else to do.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.500
Then you really do need therapy.

01:41.870 --> 01:43.970
It's just all been so crazy,you know?

01:44.040 --> 01:45.800
Starting with the first day

01:45.870 --> 01:48.140
When I woke up in that hospital, and there she was.

01:48.200 --> 01:50.400
I still don't know what you're waiting for!

01:50.470 --> 01:51.940
There is nothing standing in your way.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.370
Yeah,nothing, except that he doesn't remember he's Jim.

01:54.440 --> 01:56.170
And he might not, Mel.

01:56.240 --> 01:58.740
But you know that's Jim's spirit in there,

01:58.800 --> 02:00.640
and you know you want to be with him.

02:00.700 --> 02:03.470
You're right, it's just starting fresh with this new Jim,

02:03.540 --> 02:04.355
It's so

02:04.355 --> 02:05.170
weird!

02:05.240 --> 02:07.700
I mean,I barely know this girl,

02:07.770 --> 02:09.139
And then on the other hand,

02:09.199 --> 02:10.770
I feel like I've known her forever.

02:10.840 --> 02:12.640
I mean,I was married to this man.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.840
You know? We lived a lot of life together.

02:14.900 --> 02:17.740
I have these really strong feelings about her!

02:17.800 --> 02:19.740
So now I'm just supposed to start falling in love with a man

02:19.800 --> 02:22.000
that I've already been in love with for years?

02:22.070 --> 02:23.240
How does that even work?

02:23.300 --> 02:24.940
Where do we start?

02:25.000 --> 02:26.400
A school dance?

02:26.970 --> 02:28.040
I mean,that's,uh...

02:28.100 --> 02:31.070
Yeah,I know. I know. It's just,

02:31.140 --> 02:32.940
I promised Delia that I would chaperone tonight.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.700
But they're raising money to fight against hunger,so...

02:35.770 --> 02:36.800
Well, actually, I was going to say

02:36.870 --> 02:38.570
that in a way, it's kinda perfect.

02:38.640 --> 02:40.770
- Oh. It is? - Yeah.

02:40.840 --> 02:42.500
I mean,sure.

02:42.570 --> 02:44.670
It's,um...

02:44.740 --> 02:48.640
I mean,what better way to get over the awkward first date jitters

02:48.700 --> 02:51.070
than in a crowd of awkward teenagers?

03:09.700 --> 03:11.070
Here we are, ladies.

03:11.140 --> 03:12.470
Careful.

03:12.540 --> 03:13.755
Judging by the dance floor,

03:13.755 --> 03:14.970
I think these are spiked.

03:15.040 --> 03:17.670
I am as open-minded as the next person,

03:17.740 --> 03:19.270
but who calls that dancing?!

03:19.340 --> 03:21.970
I mean,this is a public place for god sake!

03:25.640 --> 03:27.640
Mom! You're making me look bad!

03:27.700 --> 03:29.770
Please don't tell me these are friends of yours!

03:29.840 --> 03:31.700
No, and they never will be, if you keep this up.

03:32.270 --> 03:33.700
Come on.

03:33.770 --> 03:34.640
Come on!

03:34.800 --> 03:35.840
Oh,youth.

03:36.200 --> 03:39.370
Oh! When did we become the old fogies?

03:41.000 --> 03:42.030
What do you mean?

03:43.030 --> 03:44.030
I don't think so.

03:44.300 --> 03:45.800
Guys,free drinks.

03:46.860 --> 03:47.860
Shall we?

03:47.930 --> 03:49.500
Come on. We shall.

03:50.360 --> 03:53.960
All right. I gotta get my vibe on here.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.740
Ready?

04:18.800 --> 04:21.140
Oh,come on! Don't be a buzz kill.

04:21.200 --> 04:24.670
No, I'm done.

04:41.500 --> 04:43.700
I guess this is the part

04:43.770 --> 04:46.940
where we find out if I have, uh, 2 left feet.

04:51.200 --> 04:52.740
Is this ok?

04:52.800 --> 04:55.340
Yeah,it's good.

05:04.440 --> 05:06.440
Jeff,stop it, you're being gross.

05:17.640 --> 05:19.800
Jeff, stop it, don't!

05:21.800 --> 05:23.130
That is enough!

05:24.330 --> 05:25.730
Get the hell away from her!

05:26.000 --> 05:27.970
I told you he was coming, creep.

05:28.030 --> 05:30.370
Come on. Let's go.

05:55.770 --> 05:56.630
Hey,are you ok?

05:56.700 --> 05:58.700
Yeah, yeah, be right back.

05:59.270 --> 06:00.570
Ok.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.500
- Sorry.  - Excuse me.

06:04.570 --> 06:07.000
Those kids that just left, do you know them?

06:07.070 --> 06:08.570
I've never seen him before.

06:08.830 --> 06:10.200
The girl's Kristy Marks.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.100
We were in eighth grade orchestra together.

06:12.170 --> 06:14.430
Anyone around her die lately?

06:16.000 --> 06:17.270
Sure can pick 'em.

06:17.330 --> 06:18.730
Her mom.

06:18.800 --> 06:21.270
I heard it was some kind of freak accident in their house.

06:22.530 --> 06:24.330
Don't tell me... she's here?

06:24.400 --> 06:26.370
I'm not sure yet.

06:27.770 --> 06:28.870
What's wrong with it.

06:28.870 --> 06:29.900
It's jammed!

06:36.000 --> 06:38.500
What are you doing?

06:43.070 --> 06:43.900
That's hot.

06:43.970 --> 06:45.600
Oh,my god!

06:45.670 --> 06:46.530
Are you ok?

06:46.570 --> 06:47.640
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

06:47.700 --> 06:49.840
Come on, let's go.

06:55.640 --> 06:58.440
I said stay away from her!

07:00.540 --> 07:01.300
There you are.

07:01.370 --> 07:02.900
I was wondering where you were.

07:07.600 --> 07:10.070
- That looks like trouble. - Yeah.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.500
Well, I know that Delia appreciated us being there,

07:51.570 --> 07:54.000
Even if it wasn't a perfect first date.

07:54.070 --> 07:56.970
I thought it was romantic.

07:57.040 --> 07:58.940
- Really? - Yeah.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.670
I saw 2 break-ups, 3 hook-ups,

08:00.740 --> 08:01.970
And then one kid get sick

08:02.040 --> 08:03.900
On his date's very nice shoes.

08:05.240 --> 08:07.840
And all in the short time that I was looking for you.

08:07.900 --> 08:10.040
I'm sorry again for being so distracted.

08:10.100 --> 08:11.670
- I... - Don't be.

08:11.740 --> 08:12.870
You were worried about those kids.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.540
You care about people.

08:17.670 --> 08:20.670
What's not to like?

08:23.700 --> 08:26.470
You have to stop him.

08:28.170 --> 08:29.300
Was something there?

08:29.370 --> 08:32.700
No,it's just I'm off the clock, so later!

08:33.169 --> 08:34.600
Ok, later...

08:34.669 --> 08:36.554
No,I mean... we are done with our...

08:36.554 --> 08:38.440
our chaperone duties,

08:38.500 --> 08:41.370
So why don't we have a glass of wine later?

08:41.440 --> 08:44.300
Which actually means right now.

08:44.370 --> 08:47.000
Ok. That sounds good.

08:47.070 --> 08:48.340
Does it?

08:48.400 --> 08:50.470
- Sure. - Ok.

08:51.540 --> 08:53.640
You're the only one who can see me.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.870
Please, help.

08:55.940 --> 08:57.740
Uh,you know what,

08:57.800 --> 09:00.740
It's late,and we both have to work tomorrow,

09:00.800 --> 09:02.970
So maybe we should do this another time.

09:03.040 --> 09:04.370
All right.

09:04.440 --> 09:05.840
That's fine,too.

09:05.900 --> 09:08.040
Please,stop them!

09:08.100 --> 09:09.270
I had a great time,

09:09.340 --> 09:12.270
And I really thank you for going.

09:13.570 --> 09:15.070
So...

09:15.140 --> 09:17.100
Bye.

09:17.170 --> 09:19.440
'night.

09:21.370 --> 09:22.240
Ok.

09:22.700 --> 09:23.700
What do you want?

09:23.770 --> 09:25.070
And you know what, it better be important!

09:25.640 --> 09:28.040
You're Kristy's mom, aren't you?

09:28.100 --> 09:29.170
Yes.

09:29.340 --> 09:31.400
You have to keep that boy away from her.

09:31.470 --> 09:32.470
- Which boy?  - Tim.

09:32.470 --> 09:33.570
The one she drove off with.

09:33.930 --> 09:36.300
But it looked like he was trying to help her.

09:36.470 --> 09:37.700
No. He's bad.

09:37.970 --> 09:39.670
She has no idea who he is.

09:39.730 --> 09:41.770
Ok,well, you have to tell her. I'll help you.

09:41.830 --> 09:43.830
She won't listen to me, she never has.

09:43.900 --> 09:45.900
You need to stop this.

09:52.370 --> 09:55.000
Hey. you're in early, what's up?

09:55.070 --> 09:56.970
Did something happen after the dance?

09:57.030 --> 09:58.830
Nope. Nothing.

09:58.900 --> 10:00.300
Oh,bummer. Why not?

10:00.370 --> 10:02.330
Someone's mom showed up.

10:02.400 --> 10:03.730
What,Sam's mom's back?

10:03.800 --> 10:06.030
No, not Sam's.

10:06.100 --> 10:07.430
A ghost mom. Ahe was at the dance

10:07.500 --> 10:09.430
Last night keeping tabs on her daughter Kristy.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.230
Oh,she didn't like the way we chaperoned?

10:11.300 --> 10:13.370
Apparently not. Her daughter left with a college guy

10:13.430 --> 10:14.900
After drinking some spiked punch.

10:15.170 --> 10:16.720
I rounded up all the kids who were drinking,

10:16.720 --> 10:17.470
II called their parents.

10:17.630 --> 10:19.530
Don't worry,she had a designated driver.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.370
The problem was, ghost mom didn't approve of him

10:21.430 --> 10:22.430
And thinks he's bad news.

10:22.500 --> 10:23.770
So any idea who these people are?

10:23.930 --> 10:26.530
Ned knew the girl. Kristy from orchestra.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.630
But that's all I know.

10:28.700 --> 10:30.130
There we go.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.330
It's definitely my ghost.

10:33.830 --> 10:35.770
Deborah Marks. She died a month ago,

10:35.830 --> 10:37.600
An accident at the home.

10:37.670 --> 10:39.700
Wow. That is some power couple.

10:39.770 --> 10:42.200
Yeah,she was a civil litigation lawyer.

10:42.270 --> 10:44.630
Her husband's a judge. He just got nominated

10:44.700 --> 10:45.900
For a seat on the appeals court.

10:45.970 --> 10:47.100
That's weird.

10:47.170 --> 10:48.370
The ghost's hair was singed,

10:48.430 --> 10:50.500
And I keep getting visions of ashes and burning.

10:50.570 --> 10:52.600
But it doesn't say anything about a fire.

10:52.670 --> 10:55.400
Or about the boy she's trying to keep her daughter away from.

10:55.470 --> 10:57.202
So do you want me to ask Ned

10:57.203 --> 10:59.097
To scope the girl out at school tomorrow?

10:59.100 --> 11:01.000
Thanks,but my love life can't wait that long,

11:01.070 --> 11:03.300
If I still have one.

11:11.970 --> 11:13.370
Hi.

11:13.430 --> 11:14.500
I'm really sorry to bother you,

11:14.570 --> 11:17.070
But I was a chaperone at last night's dance,

11:17.130 --> 11:18.670
And I was hoping I could talk to you about your daughter.

11:18.730 --> 11:21.000
I had a feeling the school would be sending someone.

11:21.070 --> 11:22.800
- Come in,please. - Thank you.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.300
If this is about the drinking,

11:27.370 --> 11:28.830
She told me the whole story.

11:28.900 --> 11:31.170
Her boyfriend, or rather ex-boyfriend,

11:31.230 --> 11:32.700
Spiked her punched.

11:32.770 --> 11:34.870
Jeff. Yeah, we figured that part out.

11:34.930 --> 11:36.900
I'm not saying she's not culpable.

11:36.970 --> 11:39.230
No one made her drink.

11:39.300 --> 11:43.470
But I hesitate to be too severe right now.

11:43.530 --> 11:45.130
Her mother passed away recently.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.830
I heard.

11:46.900 --> 11:48.530
Was it sudden?

11:48.600 --> 11:50.600
Just one of those freak things.

11:50.670 --> 11:52.270
She took a bad fall.

11:52.330 --> 11:54.700
Was there fire involved?

11:54.770 --> 11:56.270
No. Why do you ask?

11:56.330 --> 11:58.930
Just something that Kristy said.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.970
Well,might have been the punch talking.

12:02.030 --> 12:04.770
I'm just glad Jeff's mom drove her home.

12:04.830 --> 12:07.170
Actually,a friend picked her up.

12:07.230 --> 12:10.700
An older boy, he was in a green car.

12:12.330 --> 12:14.570
That would be Tim Dwight.

12:15.570 --> 12:16.570
I appreciate your telling me.

12:16.630 --> 12:19.430
Kristy knows I don't want her seeing him.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.100
Oh,well,actually, I think that he was

12:21.170 --> 12:22.400
Saving her from a bad situation.

12:22.470 --> 12:24.170
I understand.

12:24.230 --> 12:25.930
But Tim is not a good guy.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.430
Though you are not the first one he's fooled.

12:30.500 --> 12:31.570
Deborah,

12:31.630 --> 12:33.800
My late wife,  was a gifted lawyer,

12:33.870 --> 12:36.870
But her passion was for helping

12:36.930 --> 12:39.130
Troubled kids, giving them a second chance.

12:39.200 --> 12:40.770
Tim was one of those.

12:40.830 --> 12:43.800
He'd been in Bradford County Juvie for robbery

12:43.870 --> 12:44.470
till 8 months ago.

12:44.530 --> 12:47.770
She arranged a work probation as one of her assistants.

12:49.200 --> 12:52.100
I guess she thought he had some kind of future.

12:52.170 --> 12:53.570
And you disagreed?

12:53.630 --> 12:57.070
Look,most of the kids that Deborah took in

12:57.130 --> 12:59.430
were basically good, they just needed a break.

12:59.500 --> 13:01.330
But not tim.

13:01.400 --> 13:04.570
He came from a family  that cared about him.

13:04.630 --> 13:07.300
He was given every opportunity, but it didn't matter.

13:07.370 --> 13:11.870
He took advantage of every kindness my wife extended him.

13:11.930 --> 13:15.700
We'd all have been better off if they'd never come into our lives.

13:15.770 --> 13:17.700
I know that now.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.600
Are you ok?

13:41.670 --> 13:44.530
Yes. I'm sorry, I was just...

13:44.600 --> 13:47.770
Thinking about how hard this must be on Kristy.

13:47.830 --> 13:50.130
Was she or anyone in the house

13:50.200 --> 13:52.600
when your wife's accident happened?

13:52.670 --> 13:55.130
No. Deborah wasn't even supposed to be here.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.670
She was meeting me at a charity event.

13:56.730 --> 14:00.230
Right,I think I read something about that,

14:00.300 --> 14:02.770
Where someone walked in on the break-in.

14:02.830 --> 14:04.330
No,that's not what happened.

14:04.400 --> 14:05.770
There was no break-in at all.

14:05.830 --> 14:07.930
In fact,when I got home from the event,

14:08.000 --> 14:10.470
the alarm was on, the doors were all locked,

14:10.530 --> 14:12.100
Nothing had been disturbed.

14:16.570 --> 14:19.030
It was just a tragic accident.

14:24.770 --> 14:27.570
So,you think this bad boy Tim could have killed your ghost?

14:27.640 --> 14:30.140
No,I don't know if she was killed, but in the vision I had,

14:30.200 --> 14:32.040
It looked like she walked in on a robbery.

14:32.100 --> 14:33.870
And she definitely heard something in the house.

14:33.940 --> 14:35.500
Yum,anchovies.

14:35.570 --> 14:39.000
Ok,so she must have tripped trying to run,

14:39.070 --> 14:41.400
or she was knocked over, hit her head on the andiron.

14:41.470 --> 14:42.700
Yeah,but when the husband came home,

14:42.770 --> 14:43.970
There was no sign of a break-in.

14:44.040 --> 14:45.670
No,he said the alarm was on, the doors were locked,

14:45.740 --> 14:48.900
and it was obviously shocking to find her there.

14:48.970 --> 14:50.570
Yeah,well,this Tim worked for her.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.070
He probably had the keys,the code,

14:52.140 --> 14:53.840
and maybe even the safe combination.

14:53.900 --> 14:55.600
He could have cleaned up and locked after himself.

14:55.870 --> 14:58.200
Husband never even suspected foul play.

14:58.470 --> 14:59.900
Dang,I always wanted to say that.

14:59.970 --> 15:02.970
You know,the ghost said that Kristy didn't even know who Tim was.

15:03.040 --> 15:04.900
So maybe she was saying he was a murderer,

15:04.970 --> 15:06.870
But if that's the case, why wouldn't she just tell me?

15:06.940 --> 15:08.100
Maybe she didn't know for sure,

15:08.170 --> 15:09.500
Didn't get a good look at him.

15:09.570 --> 15:11.640
Or she wants to punish him herself.

15:11.700 --> 15:12.494
No way.

15:12.494 --> 15:15.370
If a mom knew that her daughter was hanging around with a murderer,

15:15.440 --> 15:17.240
She would tell everybody that she could

15:17.300 --> 15:18.640
and then she would punish him.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.670
I know. So I'm stumped.

15:20.740 --> 15:23.100
How are we supposed to help a ghost that won't come clean?

15:28.800 --> 15:31.500
Hey. Kristy,right?

15:31.570 --> 15:33.340
Yeah...

15:33.400 --> 15:35.670
Oh,hey,you used to be in orchestra.

15:35.740 --> 15:36.700
Ned.

15:36.770 --> 15:38.470
- Right?  - Yeah.

15:38.540 --> 15:40.140
Hey,I just want to tell you,

15:40.200 --> 15:41.900
I'm really sorry about your mom.

15:41.970 --> 15:45.470
Thanks, but I'm coping.

15:45.540 --> 15:48.470
Hey,I saw you at the dance the other night.

15:48.540 --> 15:50.670
Oh,yeah,if I did something stupid,

15:50.740 --> 15:52.240
I don't want to know.

15:52.300 --> 15:55.440
Ha,hello,my mom busted the guy that spiked the punch.

15:55.500 --> 15:57.840
Nothing tops out on the embarrassing scale.

15:57.900 --> 16:00.770
Uh,how about that creep was my date?

16:00.840 --> 16:03.870
Wait,so who's the guy that picked you up?

16:03.940 --> 16:06.440
Tim. We're just friends.

16:06.500 --> 16:07.670
He used to work for my mom,

16:07.740 --> 16:09.000
Which is why we were just friends.

16:09.070 --> 16:10.640
She didn't approve.

16:10.700 --> 16:13.840
Caused plenty of fights before she died.

16:13.900 --> 16:15.970
He seemed cool. Why didn't your mom like him?

16:16.040 --> 16:17.000
No,at first she did.

16:17.070 --> 16:18.500
He hung out at our house all the time.

16:18.570 --> 16:20.270
He was like a work study kid.

16:20.340 --> 16:22.870
Yeah,she got him a clerkship,

16:22.940 --> 16:25.100
A scholarship.

16:25.170 --> 16:27.700
So what happened?

16:27.770 --> 16:30.570
I got kind of a crush on him.

16:30.640 --> 16:32.800
Thank you.

16:32.870 --> 16:37.040
They just won this big class action suit at my mom's firm,

16:37.100 --> 16:38.970
And we were celebrating.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.400
It was always fun when Tim was over.

16:41.470 --> 16:42.940
Sorry about my parents.

16:43.000 --> 16:43.700
It's ok,it was fun.

16:43.700 --> 16:46.470
When he was leaving, I couldn't help it.

16:50.170 --> 16:53.130
Tim wasn't even into me.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.830
He said he only thought I was into him to get to my mom,

16:55.900 --> 16:57.170
which I did.

16:57.230 --> 16:58.770
I can see your mom's point.

16:58.830 --> 16:59.930
He was older.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.430
Yeah,she gave me plenty of reasons.

17:01.500 --> 17:03.630
But you thought it was something else.

17:03.700 --> 17:07.700
Look,I feel bad talking like this now that she's gone,

17:07.770 --> 17:11.369
But if he was such bad news,

17:11.430 --> 17:14.030
Why did she keep paying for his school,

17:14.099 --> 17:16.329
His tutoring, his trips home?

17:16.400 --> 17:19.200
She was in love with him.

17:22.099 --> 17:24.730
Ok, not what I expected.

17:24.800 --> 17:25.770
Yeah,I mean, I gotta say,

17:25.829 --> 17:28.329
The whole cougar thing is a little outside my kick zone.

17:28.400 --> 17:29.370
Well,if that's true,

17:29.370 --> 17:31.640
Then it explains why the ghost is being so secretive.

17:31.710 --> 17:33.310
Thanks.

17:34.810 --> 17:35.740
Hello?

17:35.810 --> 17:37.470
Eli,hey, it's Melinda.

17:37.540 --> 17:38.940
Listen,I'm trying to dig up information on Tim,

17:39.010 --> 17:40.670
But I can't find anything online.

17:40.740 --> 17:42.910
It's because juvie records are sealed.

17:42.970 --> 17:44.740
Reporters can't even mention them by name.

17:44.810 --> 17:45.810
Well,then I gotta talk to him.

17:45.870 --> 17:46.870
Can you get an address for me?

17:46.940 --> 17:49.410
Why the rush? He's still in town,right?

17:49.470 --> 17:51.710
I gotta go. I'll call you back.

17:52.070 --> 17:54.070
Hi! Glad to see you.

17:56.010 --> 17:58.040
Thanks for stopping by.

17:58.110 --> 18:00.270
Um,can we...

18:00.340 --> 18:02.670
Look,I don't know,

18:02.740 --> 18:05.140
But I've just been thinking about the other night,

18:05.210 --> 18:06.870
And... what were you thinking?

18:08.770 --> 18:11.610
Did I make you uncomfortable?

18:11.670 --> 18:13.210
No.

18:13.270 --> 18:15.170
No,not at all.

18:15.240 --> 18:16.470
It just seems that you were a little skittish,

18:16.510 --> 18:18.140
And I won't take it personally. I just...

18:18.210 --> 18:19.580
I don't want you to feel pressured.

18:19.640 --> 18:22.210
Not at all. ok? not even a little bit,

18:22.280 --> 18:23.610
Ok?

18:23.680 --> 18:25.410
There are no second thoughts here.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.580
Good. 'cause I just saw on the marquee

18:27.640 --> 18:29.310
That it's fright night week at the little theater.

18:29.380 --> 18:30.480
- You want to go?  - Wait a minute.

18:30.540 --> 18:31.680
You like scary movies?

18:31.740 --> 18:33.280
I'd really like to find out.

18:33.340 --> 18:35.410
And I'd especially like to find out with you.

18:36.510 --> 18:38.480
I'd like that,too.

18:38.540 --> 18:39.810
All right, how about tomorrow?

18:39.880 --> 18:42.140
Yes!

18:43.340 --> 18:45.380
That was a little too enthusiastic.

18:45.440 --> 18:46.610
Nah.

18:46.680 --> 18:49.540
It was just about the reaction I was hoping for.

18:50.810 --> 18:52.610
6:00 seem ok?

18:52.680 --> 18:53.610
Yeah,6:00 is...

18:53.680 --> 18:55.980
Is perfect,ok?

18:56.040 --> 18:58.580
And,um,and I'm going to be working,

18:58.640 --> 19:00.880
- So you can just come and get me here. - Ok.

19:00.940 --> 19:01.910
Bye,Delia.

19:01.980 --> 19:04.240
- Bye. - Bye.

19:06.640 --> 19:08.880
Where is she always running off to?

19:08.940 --> 19:11.100
Oh,you'll learn not to take it personally.

19:11.100 --> 19:12.740
Ok?

19:29.400 --> 19:30.640
Tim?

19:30.700 --> 19:34.740
Hi,um,I'm Melinda Gordon, I'm a friend of the Marks.

19:34.800 --> 19:35.870
Is there something wrong?

19:35.940 --> 19:37.940
No,I was a chaperone the other night at the dance,

19:38.200 --> 19:39.370
And I saw you leave with Kristy.

19:39.440 --> 19:41.040
All right,look, she called me,ok?

19:41.200 --> 19:43.700
She was buzzed. that creep was all over her.

19:43.700 --> 19:45.600
I just wanted to get her home safe,that's it.

19:45.670 --> 19:47.600
Yeah,I know. That's what it looked like,

19:47.670 --> 19:49.200
Like you were just helping her out of a jam.

19:50.900 --> 19:52.500
So what?

19:52.500 --> 19:54.100
Did Kristy's dad send you to check that story out?

19:54.170 --> 19:56.830
No. Actually, I'm not here for him.

19:56.900 --> 20:00.400
Um,I'm trying to help the family deal with their loss,

20:00.470 --> 20:03.630
And so I was hoping I could talk to you about Mrs.Marks.

20:03.700 --> 20:06.370
Well,look,she's gone now,

20:06.430 --> 20:08.500
So really,what is there to talk about?

20:08.570 --> 20:09.800
Well,I know you two were close.

20:09.870 --> 20:11.870
Kristy said that you spent a lot of time together.

20:11.930 --> 20:13.170
Mrs.Marks was good to me.

20:13.230 --> 20:15.630
She gave me a second chance when I needed one,that's it.

20:15.700 --> 20:17.730
I don't know what you're trying to get at.

20:17.800 --> 20:18.970
Well,I'm just trying to help.

20:19.030 --> 20:22.415
You know, that's exactly what your friend Mrs.Marks said

20:22.415 --> 20:23.500
when she bailed me out of juvie.

20:23.570 --> 20:25.530
And it didn't take me long to realize

20:25.600 --> 20:27.600
That there's no such thing as charity.

20:27.670 --> 20:30.030
Everyone wants something.

20:31.270 --> 20:34.300
Ok,but you just said that she was good to you.

20:34.370 --> 20:35.930
So which is it?

20:37.970 --> 20:39.800
He's been a real downer lately.

20:41.170 --> 20:42.730
Did I overhear you say you were friends with Mrs.Marks?

20:44.300 --> 20:45.730
Are you Tim's roommate?

20:45.800 --> 20:48.800
I am. Boy,he was sulking around the house after that.

20:48.870 --> 20:50.570
Really? He was upset?

20:50.630 --> 20:52.470
'cause he just seemed pretty mad.

20:52.530 --> 20:54.730
I never really understood his thing with her.

20:54.800 --> 20:57.300
What,like a romantic thing?

20:57.370 --> 21:00.000
Well,the way Tim talked, Mrs.Marks was his mentor.

21:00.070 --> 21:01.200
But then one day,

21:01.470 --> 21:04.030
her husband dropped by unexpectedly looking for tim,

21:04.100 --> 21:05.900
But he was on a business trip with Mrs.Marks.

21:05.970 --> 21:07.900
And Mr. Marks had no idea?

21:07.970 --> 21:10.600
Not the way he reacted. He was pretty upset.

21:42.070 --> 21:44.530
You said you would keep him away from my girl.

21:44.600 --> 21:47.730
You didn't keep your promise.

21:47.800 --> 21:48.965
Because I need to understand

21:48.965 --> 21:50.130
why this is so important to you.

21:50.200 --> 21:52.670
Did you and Tim have an affair?

21:52.730 --> 21:54.130
Is that what all this ash is about?

21:54.200 --> 21:55.670
Embers of your love?

21:55.730 --> 21:58.670
Stop it. I asked you to do one thing. One thing!

21:58.930 --> 22:01.100
Did your husband find out?

22:01.170 --> 22:04.030
Was he there the night that you died?

22:04.100 --> 22:05.030
I'm trying to help you!

22:05.100 --> 22:06.800
I don't want your kind of help.

22:06.870 --> 22:08.800
Stay away from my family, you understand?

22:09.570 --> 22:11.600
Stay away.

22:14.630 --> 22:17.170
Mr.Marks suspected an affair,so that's motive enough.

22:17.230 --> 22:19.430
Except if he did it, why was the safe broken into?

22:20.615 --> 22:21.730
He was looking for evidence of an affair,you know?

22:21.800 --> 22:23.400
Our ghost,his wife, came in,

22:23.470 --> 22:25.030
Catches him,they fight.

22:25.100 --> 22:27.130
You get the picture, right?

22:27.200 --> 22:29.670
Now she's protecting him out of guilt,you know?

22:29.730 --> 22:31.770
And lest we forget, he's a judge.

22:31.830 --> 22:33.930
So I doubt the cops looked at this death

22:34.000 --> 22:36.170
Or his alibi very closely.

22:36.230 --> 22:38.000
Yeah,but if hubby killed her,

22:38.070 --> 22:40.030
Why is the ghost set on keeping Tim and Kristy apart?

22:40.100 --> 22:42.230
Hello! Do you blame her?

22:43.130 --> 22:45.600
I mean, it must be so painful watching your only daughter

22:45.670 --> 22:48.300
hook up with your young lover once you're dead.

22:48.370 --> 22:49.800
I don't think that this is about jealously.

22:49.870 --> 22:50.900
It's about a mom protecting her daughter

22:50.900 --> 22:51.930
from something bad.

22:54.170 --> 22:56.200
What aren't you putting in there?

22:56.270 --> 22:57.330
Pickles.

22:57.400 --> 22:59.530
- Cabinet.  - Nice.

22:59.600 --> 23:02.630
Ok,I say we have a whodunit countdown

23:02.700 --> 23:05.430
On a scale from one to five,whose prints are on that safe?

23:05.500 --> 23:07.770
Starting with the husband.

23:09.330 --> 23:10.570
Ok,maybe three is a better bet.

23:10.630 --> 23:11.830
Why do we need a vote?

23:11.900 --> 23:13.300
Why can't we just have it checked out?

23:13.370 --> 23:15.030
Because Mr.Marks will never allow it.

23:15.100 --> 23:17.400
Well,then maybe that tells us something,too.

23:17.470 --> 23:18.670
No.

23:18.730 --> 23:20.330
Like I told you before,

23:20.400 --> 23:21.700
There was no robbery.

23:21.770 --> 23:24.030
Now what is this about?

23:26.000 --> 23:28.170
I have a gift.

23:28.230 --> 23:29.770
I can see ghosts,

23:29.830 --> 23:31.230
And...

23:31.300 --> 23:33.530
The other day, your wife's spirit was with me.

23:33.600 --> 23:35.100
That's ridiculous.

23:35.170 --> 23:36.435
She gave me a vision about

23:36.435 --> 23:37.700
what happened the night that she died,

23:37.770 --> 23:39.570
And it looked like she had walked in on a robbery.

23:39.630 --> 23:42.930
Which is odd, considering you said there wasn't one.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
I think it's time for you both to leave.

23:45.070 --> 23:47.500
The safe behind that picture frame,

23:47.570 --> 23:49.630
It had been rummaged.

23:49.700 --> 23:52.330
And she was either hit or tripped or fell

23:52.400 --> 23:54.670
Somewhere over there.

23:55.930 --> 23:58.500
That information wasn't in any of the newspapers.

23:58.770 --> 24:00.930
Sometimes spirits stay earth-bound.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.570
It's usually for a reason.

24:02.630 --> 24:04.100
I think that she's protecting someone...

24:04.170 --> 24:07.370
Tim,Kristy,or... maybe even you.

24:07.430 --> 24:09.530
And what would she have to protect me from?

24:09.600 --> 24:10.930
She didn't tell me,

24:11.000 --> 24:12.730
but I think it's something that she was ashamed of.

24:12.800 --> 24:14.630
Melinda spoke with Tim's roommate.

24:14.700 --> 24:17.330
He said you'd been there looking for Tim before your wife died.

24:17.400 --> 24:19.230
He was worried that you thought

24:19.300 --> 24:20.830
maybe they had had an affair.

24:20.900 --> 24:23.470
Ok,this is none of your business.

24:23.530 --> 24:26.470
Unless you have some reason

24:26.530 --> 24:28.230
for wanting my wife's memory tarnished.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.300
Actually,we think it's your sterling reputation

24:30.370 --> 24:31.700
your wife is trying to keep untarnished.

24:31.770 --> 24:33.900
You keep saying there wasn't a fire,

24:33.970 --> 24:36.200
but I see ashes; something burning.

24:36.270 --> 24:37.730
Was there anything missing from the safe,

24:37.800 --> 24:39.470
anything at all that could have been burned?

24:39.530 --> 24:41.500
I haven't had the heart to open it since she died.

24:41.570 --> 24:44.130
I've been afraid of what I might find.

24:44.200 --> 24:45.800
Like evidence of an affair?

24:45.870 --> 24:49.100
None of it matters now.

24:49.170 --> 24:50.730
I loved my wife,

24:50.800 --> 24:53.470
and if Tim had something to do with her death,

24:53.530 --> 24:54.630
then yes, I want to know about it.

24:54.700 --> 24:56.730
But it's none of your concern,

24:56.800 --> 24:58.800
so if you'll please excuse me...

25:22.900 --> 25:25.230
So the burning paper in your vision,

25:25.300 --> 25:26.430
any idea what it was?

25:26.500 --> 25:28.130
It was charred, but I could make out

25:28.200 --> 25:29.870
that it was a woman's handwriting,so...

25:30.230 --> 25:32.170
See? Can I call it or what!

25:32.230 --> 25:34.270
A love letter. It's gotta be.

25:34.330 --> 25:35.730
The ghost could have been burning it.

25:35.800 --> 25:38.630
Tim walked in, they fought, and kabonk!

25:38.700 --> 25:41.830
Or Tim could have been burning it when Mrs. Marks walked in.

25:41.900 --> 25:43.070
Or Mr. Marks burned it.

25:43.130 --> 25:45.230
Well,any way you slice it, the paper was burned.

25:45.300 --> 25:47.130
So someone wanted whatever was on it

25:47.200 --> 25:48.270
to be kept a secret.

25:48.490 --> 25:50.660
Yeah,and the ghost still does.

25:50.730 --> 25:52.630
I'll get it.

25:52.690 --> 25:54.760
Maybe Sam's early.

25:54.830 --> 25:56.060
Kristy!

25:56.930 --> 25:58.730
What's wrong?

25:58.790 --> 26:00.190
How could you do this?

26:00.190 --> 26:01.190
Do what?

26:01.260 --> 26:02.720
The cops just took Tim in for questioning

26:02.790 --> 26:05.090
about some supposed robbery at my house!

26:05.160 --> 26:08.620
My dad had the safe fingerprinted because of what you said!

26:08.990 --> 26:10.690
Well,if his fingerprints were there...

26:10.860 --> 26:12.760
Of course they were there!

26:12.820 --> 26:14.520
He was my mom's assistant!

26:14.590 --> 26:15.960
Look,Kristy, I know that you're upset,

26:16.020 --> 26:17.820
But maybe your feelings for Tim are clouding your judgment.

26:17.890 --> 26:20.390
He's innocent! He was with me,

26:20.460 --> 26:21.660
We were at the bookstore.

26:21.720 --> 26:23.360
-Did you tell your dad that? -Yeah.

26:23.420 --> 26:26.560
My dad thinks that I'm just lying to protect tim,

26:26.620 --> 26:28.360
And he won't even look at me.

26:28.420 --> 26:31.805
Like I would protect my own mom's murderer,

26:31.805 --> 26:32.790
that's insane!

26:32.860 --> 26:36.120
Look,you know that he has a history

26:36.190 --> 26:37.490
and a criminal record,

26:37.560 --> 26:40.060
and maybe it's possible that he isn't who you think he is.

26:40.120 --> 26:42.720
I know that he would not hurt anyone.

26:42.790 --> 26:45.860
And if you do talk to ghosts like my dad said,

26:45.920 --> 26:48.120
why don't you just ask my mom?

26:48.190 --> 26:50.190
Because I don't think she'd talk to me.

26:50.260 --> 26:52.740
She's mad because I didn't

26:52.840 --> 26:54.620
keep you and Tim apart.

26:56.460 --> 26:58.820
Sometimes I just hate her.

27:02.060 --> 27:04.160
This isn't what I wanted.

27:04.220 --> 27:05.360
Then what do you want?

27:05.420 --> 27:07.960
Please,just tell me what happened,

27:08.020 --> 27:10.090
Because you're the only one who can fix this.

27:10.160 --> 27:12.020
I really wish I could.

27:13.190 --> 27:15.820
But some secrets are better left alone.

27:21.200 --> 27:23.400
I got nothin'. Tim's still being questioned.

27:23.460 --> 27:25.000
Detective Blair couldn't tell me anything yet.

27:25.060 --> 27:26.800
Well,did they find anything missing from the safe?

27:26.860 --> 27:28.530
What part of "I got nothin'" didn't you get?

27:28.600 --> 27:30.130
All right. Sorry,I thought

27:30.200 --> 27:31.230
you could pull some weight in there.

27:31.300 --> 27:32.800
No,but apparently judge Marks does.

27:32.860 --> 27:34.560
They're looking at this as a possible murder case.

27:34.630 --> 27:36.430
My guess is, Tim's going to be in there for a while.

27:36.500 --> 27:39.330
Oh,I hope I did the right thing by having them check that safe.

27:39.400 --> 27:40.700
Don't be such a softie.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.200
You told me yourself you had a vision

27:42.260 --> 27:44.130
of Mrs. Marks walking in on a break-in.

27:44.200 --> 27:46.830
Tim's prints are all over that safe,

27:46.900 --> 27:48.100
Ok? He seems pretty guilty to me.

27:48.160 --> 27:49.460
Yeah,but...

27:49.530 --> 27:51.000
And please don't tell me you're having second thoughts

27:51.060 --> 27:53.130
because Deborah never actually said she saw Tim do it.

27:53.200 --> 27:55.160
We both know she just saying what she did.

27:55.230 --> 27:56.730
- Ok,still... - And I don't want to hear

27:56.800 --> 27:59.400
please that Kristy said she swears he was with her.

27:59.460 --> 28:00.930
She's no more reliable than her mother.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.900
-Except. -Don't tell me you're falling for Tim,too.

28:02.960 --> 28:05.430
No! all right? I'm just trying to think out loud,

28:05.500 --> 28:07.160
which would be easier without so many interruptions.

28:07.230 --> 28:08.760
Sorry.

28:08.830 --> 28:11.160
The ghost said that Kristy doesn't know who Tim is,

28:11.230 --> 28:12.760
So couldn't that have something to do with his record?

28:12.830 --> 28:14.030
I mean,maybe that's what she burned.

28:14.100 --> 28:16.600
-the police report,or... -Which we can't access.

28:16.660 --> 28:17.800
Yeah,but we could talk to somebody who knew him,

28:17.860 --> 28:19.645
his mom only lives like an hour away...

28:19.645 --> 28:20.230
Crap!

28:20.300 --> 28:22.930
My date with Sam! I almost forgot.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.130
I knew you didn't wear that for me.

28:26.200 --> 28:27.960
I can't cancel,ok? Can you handle this?

28:28.030 --> 28:29.700
I'd love to, but starting at 3:00,

28:29.760 --> 28:31.060
I got back-to-back cases.

28:31.090 --> 28:33.460
Fine. You know what, if I rush,I'll make it back in time.

28:35.090 --> 28:36.890
I only found out my son was in trouble again

28:36.960 --> 28:37.920
when I called his apartment.

28:37.990 --> 28:40.420
Tim didn't want me to be upset,I guess.

28:40.490 --> 28:42.690
You're a friend of Mrs. Marks?

28:42.760 --> 28:44.360
Yes. She thought a lot of your son.

28:44.420 --> 28:45.690
That's why I'm here.

28:45.760 --> 28:47.320
Yeah.

28:47.390 --> 28:48.990
She was a wonderful person,

28:49.060 --> 28:50.590
really believed in Tim.

28:50.660 --> 28:52.790
He's a good boy.

28:52.860 --> 28:55.620
There's no way he had anything to do with her death.

28:56.860 --> 28:59.390
But he was arrested before for robbery.

28:59.460 --> 29:00.760
He was innocent then,too.

29:00.820 --> 29:03.220
Tim's girlfriend's older brother did it.

29:03.290 --> 29:05.220
So why did Tim take the blame?

29:05.290 --> 29:08.220
The girl came to him crying,

29:08.290 --> 29:10.120
said that her brother broke into an electronics store.

29:10.190 --> 29:13.090
Tim went to stop him, only the cops showed up.

29:13.160 --> 29:15.290
He knew the older boy had 2 strikes,

29:15.360 --> 29:16.960
So he said he did it.

29:17.020 --> 29:20.690
Do you mind if look at some of his things?

29:20.760 --> 29:21.920
It might help.

29:21.990 --> 29:24.160
You can scour the whole house if you like.

29:24.220 --> 29:25.890
I just want my boy's name cleared.

29:27.660 --> 29:29.890
That's Tim and his brother George.

29:29.960 --> 29:31.020
Older?

29:31.090 --> 29:33.060
Mmm, by about 8 years.

29:33.120 --> 29:34.990
Tim was an unexpected blessing.

29:40.560 --> 29:41.990
The Little Prince.

29:42.060 --> 29:44.190
That was Tim's first book.

29:50.320 --> 29:52.290
There's a page missing.

29:52.360 --> 29:53.760
Do you know what happened?

29:53.820 --> 29:55.060
God knows.

29:55.120 --> 29:57.690
It's a wonder this thing has any pages left at all.

29:57.760 --> 29:59.460
Tim just loved that story.

29:59.520 --> 30:01.290
It came home from the hospital with him.

30:01.360 --> 30:02.890
Well,that's sweet.

30:02.960 --> 30:04.620
Usually it's blankets and booties.

30:04.690 --> 30:07.220
I'm afraid they wouldn't have fit our Timmy.

30:07.290 --> 30:09.390
He was almost 6 months old when we brought him home.

30:09.460 --> 30:11.120
Why? Was something wrong?

30:11.190 --> 30:12.820
No, it was just the agency protocol.

30:13.890 --> 30:15.520
Tim was adopted.

30:27.120 --> 30:28.860
I ruined everything.

30:28.920 --> 30:30.790
It's ok.

30:30.860 --> 30:33.290
You don't have to keep secrets anymore.

30:33.360 --> 30:35.690
I know why you care so much about tim,

30:35.760 --> 30:38.990
And I know why you don't want him to be with your daughter.

30:41.120 --> 30:43.520
He's her brother, isn't he?

30:44.960 --> 30:46.920
Yes.

30:48.890 --> 30:51.120
Tim's my son.

30:52.060 --> 30:53.520
It was the hardest thing I ever did,

30:53.790 --> 30:54.990
Letting him go.

30:55.260 --> 30:56.775
And then when I found him again,

30:56.775 --> 30:58.290
it was like a gift.

30:59.060 --> 31:00.790
Tell me what happened.

31:02.060 --> 31:05.220
Douglas and I fell in love when he was in law school.

31:05.290 --> 31:06.690
I was an undergrad.

31:06.760 --> 31:09.120
Not long after that, I found out that I was pregnant.

31:09.190 --> 31:11.060
And he didn't want children yet?

31:11.120 --> 31:12.790
It wasn't his.

31:12.860 --> 31:14.660
It was somebody I dated before him.

31:14.720 --> 31:17.290
So I told Doug that I was taking a year abroad,

31:17.360 --> 31:19.660
And I went home to have the baby.

31:19.720 --> 31:22.860
I tried to keep him, but I was 18,

31:22.920 --> 31:24.890
Barely older than Kristy.

31:24.960 --> 31:27.820
In the end, I had to do what was best for my baby.

31:27.890 --> 31:29.890
And you never told Douglas?

31:29.960 --> 31:32.020
I tried to put it behind me,

31:32.090 --> 31:35.860
But it haunted me.

31:35.920 --> 31:39.520
I looked for Tim in the face of every boy his age.

31:39.590 --> 31:42.290
And finally I hired a private detective.

31:42.360 --> 31:44.160
And he found Tim in jail.

31:44.220 --> 31:47.390
I couldn't stand seeing my boy in that place.

31:47.460 --> 31:48.990
I had to get him out.

31:49.060 --> 31:50.620
So why didn't you tell your family?

31:50.990 --> 31:52.320
Or his?

31:52.390 --> 31:54.260
I thought maybe there was a way I could help him

31:54.320 --> 31:56.090
Without stirring things up.

31:57.360 --> 32:00.360
And then Kristy fell for tim.

32:01.460 --> 32:04.090
Seems like that would have been a good time to say something.

32:04.160 --> 32:05.790
And I would have if it weren't for Douglas'

32:05.860 --> 32:07.190
appointment to the bench.

32:07.260 --> 32:09.120
So I figured I would just keep Tim and Kristy apart

32:09.190 --> 32:10.420
Until he was confirmed,

32:10.490 --> 32:12.120
And then I'd tell everyone.

32:12.190 --> 32:14.920
So the business trip,  with tim,

32:14.990 --> 32:17.520
that was really just to spend time with your child?

32:17.590 --> 32:19.420
Yes.

32:19.490 --> 32:22.720
And then a week later,

32:22.790 --> 32:25.490
I lost the chance of ever telling him the truth.

32:27.860 --> 32:30.460
I'd stopped by the house to get my cell phone.

32:30.520 --> 32:32.960
I couldn't help but think it was Tim.

32:33.020 --> 32:36.190
Maybe he was getting back at me about Kristy.

32:38.660 --> 32:41.740
And then I saw that the note I wrote him when he was a baby

32:41.740 --> 32:43.220
was gone.

32:43.290 --> 32:45.060
I panicked.

32:45.120 --> 32:48.190
Kristy was always going on about how I was in love with Tim.

32:48.260 --> 32:50.560
I mean,maybe he thought that it was a love letter.

32:51.490 --> 32:52.760
So I cleaned up.

32:52.820 --> 32:55.120
I couldn't let anyone know that Tim was there.

32:55.190 --> 32:58.390
I felt so responsible for the break-in,

32:58.460 --> 32:59.890
For everything.

32:59.960 --> 33:02.690
I brought it all on myself.

33:02.760 --> 33:04.920
And that's when I saw it.

33:20.060 --> 33:22.660
I don't blame him for burning it.

33:22.720 --> 33:24.890
It was the missing page from his book,wasn't it?

33:24.960 --> 33:27.120
It was a closed adoption.

33:27.190 --> 33:29.660
A personal note wasn't permitted.

33:30.960 --> 33:33.790
So you ripped out the page, and you gave him the book.

33:33.860 --> 33:36.060
I wanted him to have something from me.

33:36.120 --> 33:39.460
And I kept the note all that time because it was a piece of him.

33:40.620 --> 33:43.190
Deborah, I...

33:43.260 --> 33:47.720
I don't think Tim thought it was a love letter.

33:47.790 --> 33:49.760
I think he knew exactly what it was,

33:49.820 --> 33:51.720
And that's why he's been so upset.

33:51.790 --> 33:55.290
He wasn't mad, he...

33:55.360 --> 33:57.460
He was mourning you.

33:57.520 --> 33:59.520
But if Tim knew that he was my son,

33:59.590 --> 34:01.620
Why wouldn't he tell Kristy?

34:01.690 --> 34:04.160
Unless...

34:06.420 --> 34:08.659
He thinks he's protecting her.

34:08.719 --> 34:09.820
His sister.

34:09.889 --> 34:11.690
Maybe that's it.

34:17.360 --> 34:20.120
At some point, you broke into that safe,

34:20.190 --> 34:23.520
And either you or Tim burnt a note that you found inside of it.

34:24.460 --> 34:25.520
Just tell me

34:25.590 --> 34:27.360
Why you were in the safe that night.

34:27.420 --> 34:28.920
Because...

34:28.989 --> 34:32.520
I couldn't look at my own mom anymore.

34:32.590 --> 34:36.219
It was sick. She falls for somebody that I like,

34:36.290 --> 34:38.190
And then makes it seem like I did something wrong.

34:38.260 --> 34:40.620
And my dad wouldn't listen.

34:40.719 --> 34:43.489
It was like I didn't exist.

34:43.560 --> 34:45.989
And I needed out.

34:46.060 --> 34:47.620
So why was Tim here?

34:47.690 --> 34:49.960
To try and stop me.

34:50.020 --> 34:51.790
Kristy,you don't want to do this.

34:51.860 --> 34:53.219
No,I really do.

34:53.290 --> 34:56.389
What is all this stuff? Where is it?

34:56.460 --> 34:59.090
Where does she keep her cash?!

34:59.160 --> 35:01.460
One of these things has got to have money in it!

35:01.520 --> 35:03.660
Oh,my god,someone's coming!

35:03.720 --> 35:05.890
Come on,let's go!

35:17.060 --> 35:19.390
Then we ran out the back door.

35:19.460 --> 35:22.960
I swear,we had no idea what had happened

35:23.020 --> 35:25.060
Tim didn't break in?

35:25.120 --> 35:27.060
It was Kristy?

35:28.860 --> 35:31.860
Why didn't you say anything when they brought Tim in today?

35:31.920 --> 35:33.990
I was afraid that if I said he was here,

35:34.060 --> 35:36.060
It would make things worse for him.

35:36.120 --> 35:39.290
But I knew that he did not hurt my mom,

35:39.360 --> 35:42.020
Because he was with me the whole night.

35:42.090 --> 35:44.420
I did that,too... tried to hide the truth

35:44.490 --> 35:46.190
To protect my family.

35:47.490 --> 35:51.260
But the lies hurt more than anything.

35:55.060 --> 35:57.660
Kristy, your mom's here.

36:02.590 --> 36:06.220
And what Tim found out that night,she wants you to know,too.

36:07.990 --> 36:09.660
He was her son.

36:11.820 --> 36:14.990
She'd put him up for adoption when he was a baby.

36:18.690 --> 36:21.860
He's...my brother?

36:25.720 --> 36:27.560
What's going on?

36:27.620 --> 36:29.290
Daddy...

36:32.160 --> 36:34.190
Your wife is here.

36:34.260 --> 36:37.490
And there's something she needs to tell you.

36:44.990 --> 36:47.990
I could never understand, why me?

36:48.060 --> 36:50.290
I mean, there were plenty of other kids in juvie,

36:50.360 --> 36:51.390
Ones that could have used the break.

36:51.460 --> 36:53.320
But why'd she pick me?

36:53.390 --> 36:55.790
I knew it wasn't because of what Kristy said.

36:55.860 --> 36:58.620
I mean, it just wasn't like that.

36:58.690 --> 37:00.420
And then you found the note?

37:00.490 --> 37:02.360
I must have read that book a thousand times.

37:02.420 --> 37:04.790
Don't ask me why.

37:06.390 --> 37:10.020
And I always wondered what happened to that page.

37:11.220 --> 37:13.360
But why hide it?

37:14.220 --> 37:15.960
Why hide it from her family

37:16.020 --> 37:17.890
That I was her son,  from her family?

37:17.960 --> 37:20.860
I could only think that it was because she was ashamed of me.

37:20.920 --> 37:22.990
Oh, god, that's not true.

37:23.060 --> 37:24.390
I cherished you.

37:24.460 --> 37:26.990
She wasn't ashamed of you.

37:27.060 --> 37:29.520
She cherished you.

37:29.590 --> 37:31.720
She wants you to know how sorry she is.

37:31.790 --> 37:35.720
I just didn't know what your family would do, or mine.

37:35.790 --> 37:38.320
I'd broken all kinds of closed adoption rules in contacting you.

37:38.390 --> 37:40.460
She was scared.

37:40.520 --> 37:43.620
About what would happen to your family, and hers.

37:43.690 --> 37:45.220
But she's here.

37:47.190 --> 37:50.960
I was always so scared.

37:51.020 --> 37:54.120
Since the moment you were born,

37:54.190 --> 37:57.020
Looking at your...  your face.

37:57.090 --> 38:00.720
I loved you so much, and it terrified me.

38:00.790 --> 38:02.790
I was scared that...

38:02.860 --> 38:04.460
That I couldn't take care of you,

38:04.520 --> 38:07.120
Or that your new family wouldn't be good to you,

38:07.190 --> 38:10.490
Or when I found you again, I was scared of who you'd be.

38:10.560 --> 38:13.260
I just wanted so badly to do good;

38:13.320 --> 38:16.860
To do what was right.

38:16.920 --> 38:19.490
But it all went wrong.

38:20.620 --> 38:22.990
She was scared

38:23.060 --> 38:25.790
That she wouldn't be able to give you what you needed.

38:25.860 --> 38:29.760
She really wanted to do what was best for you,

38:29.820 --> 38:31.720
And she's afraid she didn't.

38:31.790 --> 38:33.420
No,no,no,no,no.

38:33.490 --> 38:35.920
That's not true.

38:35.990 --> 38:39.060
You tell her she did the best she could.

38:41.320 --> 38:42.920
She's listening.

38:42.990 --> 38:45.790
She did so much right.

38:45.860 --> 38:47.660
You gave me a great life,

38:47.720 --> 38:49.820
And a wonderful family that loves me.

38:49.990 --> 38:52.168
And when I needed help, when I got in trouble,

38:52.168 --> 38:53.620
You gave me a second chance.

38:54.290 --> 38:58.690
And I'm not gonna take that for granted.

38:58.760 --> 39:02.390
I'm gonna make you proud of me, I promise.

39:02.460 --> 39:05.120
Oh, sweetheart.

39:05.190 --> 39:07.290
I already am.

39:08.620 --> 39:11.160
She said she already is proud of you.

39:15.060 --> 39:17.120
There's one more thing.

39:18.220 --> 39:21.160
In that note that you left for me,

39:21.220 --> 39:23.920
I only remember the first part...

39:23.990 --> 39:27.790
"My Tim, my little prince,

39:27.860 --> 39:30.820
All the places you'll go..."

39:35.420 --> 39:37.690
"all the worlds you will see.

39:37.760 --> 39:40.560
"My love is always with you.

39:40.620 --> 39:42.690
"I wrap you in it,

39:42.760 --> 39:45.090
"like a prince's cape,

39:45.160 --> 39:48.520
My sweet,sweet boy."

39:48.590 --> 39:50.560
The worlds you'll see.

39:50.620 --> 39:53.660
My love is always with you,

39:53.720 --> 39:56.490
Wrapped around you like a prince's cape,

39:56.560 --> 39:58.190
My sweet,sweet boy.

40:02.990 --> 40:04.960
She's ready.

40:08.420 --> 40:10.790
She's not scared anymore.

40:22.790 --> 40:24.690
Thank you.

40:29.060 --> 40:31.020
Hey, this is Sam Lucas.

40:31.090 --> 40:33.060
Please leave me a message after the beep.

40:34.190 --> 40:36.690
Yeah, hi. Um,it's me.

40:36.760 --> 40:38.590
Um, Melinda.

40:38.660 --> 40:40.020
I hope that,uh,

40:40.090 --> 40:43.260
Well,I hope that you're getting all of my messages.

40:43.320 --> 40:48.060
Um, I'm still hoping for that... that rain check,

40:48.120 --> 40:51.120
You know,the one that I've mentioned now,

40:51.190 --> 40:54.320
Well,a million times, actually.

40:54.390 --> 40:57.760
Um, ok.

40:57.820 --> 41:00.290
Could you... could you just...

41:03.060 --> 41:04.960
Call me back?

41:12.190 --> 41:14.060
Come in.

41:21.820 --> 41:23.790
I'm sorry I flaked.

41:25.960 --> 41:29.020
I was just wondering about that rain check.

41:30.490 --> 41:32.020
What do you mean?

41:32.090 --> 41:33.990
Didn't you get my messages?

41:35.390 --> 41:37.320
No, not yet.

41:37.390 --> 41:39.360
I saw that you called.

41:41.790 --> 41:44.620
So you just didn't pick up.

41:45.920 --> 41:48.590
No.

41:52.960 --> 41:55.110
It was 7:00

41:55.110 --> 41:57.260
and I was standing on the sidewalk in front of a dark store.

41:57.320 --> 41:59.390
I'd been there for about an hour.

41:59.460 --> 42:04.990
As adorable and cockamamie as your excuse surely is,

42:05.060 --> 42:06.960
I didn't pick up.

42:09.260 --> 42:11.060
Look, I know what it's about.

42:11.120 --> 42:13.620
What? what is it about?

42:13.690 --> 42:15.120
That you're not ready to start dating yet,

42:15.190 --> 42:16.660
And it makes total sense.

42:16.720 --> 42:17.720
I understand,

42:17.790 --> 42:19.290
And there's no hard feelings.

42:19.360 --> 42:20.520
No, but I am ready!

42:20.590 --> 42:22.620
Your head says you are...

42:22.690 --> 42:25.790
But your heart says no, not yet.

42:25.860 --> 42:27.690
No, it doesn't!

42:27.760 --> 42:31.260
Ok, my heart doesn't say that.

42:31.320 --> 42:33.160
I think I would know what my heart says.

42:33.220 --> 42:36.160
Melinda, I get it. It's ok. You don't have to do...

43:02.560 --> 43:04.320
Ok.

43:06.690 --> 43:08.490
What about the rain check?

43:10.860 --> 43:12.890
I'm free right now, how about you?

43:12.960 --> 43:15.160
Yeah.

43:20.460 --> 43:22.560
- I'm ready.  - Me, too.

43:27.120 --> 43:29.220
You're gonna freeze. Here,take this.

43:29.290 --> 43:30.990
Oh,thank you.
