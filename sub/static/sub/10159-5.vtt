JOSlE: Good morning, housemates!
26 hours till finals!

00:05.640 --> 00:07.596
Ah, sh...it!

00:07.640 --> 00:08.834
Hot!

00:12.280 --> 00:14.271
Er, Kingsley, l...

00:14.320 --> 00:16.038
got your tea.

00:16.079 --> 00:17.433
Fuck off!

00:18.480 --> 00:20.118
Vod, I made you a...

00:20.160 --> 00:21.388
Ohh...

00:21.440 --> 00:23.112
Get out.

00:27.640 --> 00:30.074
Ooh... Ooh... Ooh...

00:31.280 --> 00:32.348
Oh, my God!

00:32.400 --> 00:33.719
Don't look at me!

00:33.760 --> 00:35.239
Howard?.

00:35.280 --> 00:38.636
Yes, I'm masturbating,
and, no, I do not have time to stop.

00:38.680 --> 00:40.079
OK.

00:40.120 --> 00:43.271
Guys, I know it's exam time
and everyone's revising

00:43.320 --> 00:44.878
and you're all under a lot of stress,

00:44.920 --> 00:47.992
but can you please
stop wanking and shouting?.!

01:16.680 --> 01:18.716
Oh, you're not wanking!

01:18.760 --> 01:20.159
No.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.430
I'm tired of wanking.

01:22.480 --> 01:28.191
You know, it is said that when a man
is tired of wanking, he is tired of life.

01:28.240 --> 01:30.754
Yeah, I don't think that is said.

01:30.800 --> 01:32.392
How's the revision going?.

01:32.440 --> 01:33.998
I've gone slightly insane.

01:34.040 --> 01:37.237
I wrote the word "igneous"
thousands of times on tiny little cards.

01:39.600 --> 01:40.999
JOSlE: OK.

01:43.040 --> 01:44.712
Oh!

01:44.760 --> 01:46.159
New commission?.

01:46.200 --> 01:47.189
No.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.719
I drew that for fun.

01:51.120 --> 01:52.951
Well, if there's anything
I can do to help...

01:53.000 --> 01:56.549
Anything within certain limits.

02:13.080 --> 02:17.676
Housemates! At the beep,
the time until finals will be...

02:17.720 --> 02:19.358
22 hours.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.152
Beep!

02:26.000 --> 02:27.513
What if you wake up
on the morning of your finals

02:27.560 --> 02:29.391
- and your hands have gone all floppy?.
- Shut up, Josie.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.715
What if you've just got these floppy hands
and they won't hold a pen

02:31.760 --> 02:33.512
and you turn up to exams
and you're like, "Oh, hi,

02:33.560 --> 02:35.516
"I'm Edward Floppyhands,
I don't think I can do my exam"?.

02:35.560 --> 02:36.834
- Shut up, Josie.
- It probably won't happen,

02:36.880 --> 02:38.598
but it could happen.
What if it has happened?.

02:38.640 --> 02:40.949
- I might google it.
- Don't you google it.

02:42.480 --> 02:44.311
Howard, I've made you
a salmon and kelp smoothie.

02:44.360 --> 02:45.998
It's got eight Pro Plus in it.

02:46.040 --> 02:48.235
Slaty cleavage, gneiss, gastroliths,
escarpments...

02:48.280 --> 02:49.759
- I'll just pop it down.
- Not...

02:49.800 --> 02:51.472
on the table.

02:53.640 --> 02:56.712
Josie, this is an exernal partition
of my mind.

02:56.760 --> 03:00.275
Would you put an uncoastered drink
onto my mind?.

03:02.360 --> 03:06.399
Hey, Vod, I need another book
of tickets for Vod's World Of Carnage.

03:06.440 --> 03:08.510
Vod and Kingsley's World
Of Cheese And Carnage, thank you.

03:08.560 --> 03:09.595
It's the Lake Of Fire.

03:09.640 --> 03:12.712
You say those three little words
and everyone's, like,

03:12.760 --> 03:16.150
"Oh, Josie, please take my money!
Anything for the Lake Of Fire!"

03:16.200 --> 03:18.555
Well, it is an amazing concept,
to be totally fair to myself.

03:18.600 --> 03:21.398
- I didn't sign off on a Lake Of Fire.
- Kingo,

03:21.440 --> 03:25.115
I have told you -
head of logistics, head of vision.

03:25.160 --> 03:28.277
You know, I come up with the concepts,
you come up with the... plastic cups.

03:28.320 --> 03:31.153
I'm sorting the plastic cups?.!

03:31.200 --> 03:32.997
That is...

03:33.040 --> 03:34.837
beyond the fucking pale.

03:34.880 --> 03:36.393
Well, I've only gone and done it.

03:36.440 --> 03:39.637
I've fucked it off and hired a barge.

03:39.680 --> 03:41.910
I need to just get away from it all -

03:41.960 --> 03:43.757
no internet, no...

03:46.720 --> 03:49.917
-...distractions.
- How have you afforded that?.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.473
- You're broke.
- Oh,

03:51.520 --> 03:53.397
I cracked into my 5K buffer.

03:53.440 --> 03:54.668
So...

03:54.720 --> 03:56.950
Howard...

03:57.000 --> 04:00.515
what do you say to me, you
and your lovely, lovely brain table

04:00.560 --> 04:04.712
taking a serene study cruise
down the historic Barton Aqueduct?.

04:04.760 --> 04:07.399
Oh, let me guess,
all aboard the banter barge?.

04:07.440 --> 04:09.158
Nope. No bants.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.792
Tough on bants.

04:10.840 --> 04:14.992
Tough on the causes of bants.
Total bants clamp-down.

04:15.040 --> 04:17.235
Just pure, hard-core study.

04:17.279 --> 04:22.149
JP, suffice it to say, I will not
be joining you on your ship of fools.

04:28.520 --> 04:29.669
Seven.

04:30.760 --> 04:32.557
I'm seven days clean.

04:32.600 --> 04:35.398
Seven days since I shagged JP.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.635
I'm proud of you, mate.

04:37.680 --> 04:39.591
A week sober.

04:39.640 --> 04:41.073
Yeah.

04:41.120 --> 04:42.519
It's like...

04:42.560 --> 04:47.076
I'm not sure I'll ever be in a place where
I can say I'll never shag JP again, but...

04:47.120 --> 04:49.236
by God, I'm gonna try!

04:50.880 --> 04:54.190
Here's something
to take your mind off JP's knob.

04:54.240 --> 04:55.229
More tickets.

05:13.040 --> 05:14.109
You've had a man in here!

05:14.160 --> 05:16.116
- No!
- No?.

05:16.160 --> 05:17.878
Hmm.

05:19.880 --> 05:21.871
So...what is this?.!

05:21.920 --> 05:23.956
The world's straightest pube?.

05:26.800 --> 05:28.119
I'm seeing...

05:28.160 --> 05:29.832
A private tutor. I...

05:29.880 --> 05:32.633
am having private tuition
before my finals.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.159
Oh.

05:34.200 --> 05:37.317
So...who's paying for that, then?. Merkel?.

05:37.360 --> 05:39.669
- Please don't call my dad that.
- It's all right for some, innit?.

05:39.720 --> 05:42.996
Look, I'm behind.
What with my failed presidency,

05:43.040 --> 05:45.508
and my scholarship,

05:45.560 --> 05:48.154
I have a lot of catching up to do

05:48.200 --> 05:52.352
and they can be very insistent,
Geoff and Lynda,

05:52.400 --> 05:57.394
which is incredibly helpful,
because it reminds me what's at stake,

05:57.440 --> 06:03.072
but also sometimes a teeny bit fucking
much, if you know what I mean.

06:03.120 --> 06:06.874
Anyway, er, post come, this from...

06:08.040 --> 06:10.952
...TV Licence and...

06:11.000 --> 06:12.228
this.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.876
Got a US postmark, so I thought...

06:15.920 --> 06:17.797
My Fulbright application.

06:19.520 --> 06:21.397
What if they found out
about the impeachment

06:21.440 --> 06:23.351
and they're rejecting me
and then I have a meltdown

06:23.400 --> 06:24.469
and I shave off all my eyebrows

06:24.520 --> 06:25.839
- and I can't revise?.
- You don't wanna

06:25.880 --> 06:28.599
go under exam conditions
without eyebrows. Believe.

06:28.640 --> 06:30.437
You take it.

06:30.480 --> 06:33.438
I'll open it...afterwards.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.038
JOSlE: Oh, come on, open it!

06:42.480 --> 06:43.674
Hi, Oregon.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.993
I just wanted to know if you got it!

06:50.760 --> 06:53.832
I definitely said "mamma mia",
cos I say it all the time.

06:53.880 --> 06:57.031
"Mamma mia,
I've got a lot of revision to do."

06:57.080 --> 07:00.595
"Mamma mia, it's my finals tomorrow
and my girlfriend won't fucking kiss me."

07:00.640 --> 07:03.677
Look, I think we both know
it's gone a bit weird lately.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.079
Are you breaking up with me?.

07:08.120 --> 07:09.439
No.

07:09.480 --> 07:11.675
Cos if you are, I'd rather
you just did it, because I cannot have

07:11.720 --> 07:13.631
the sword of rejection hanging over me
for my whole finals.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.318
Let's just be adults, Rosa.

07:15.360 --> 07:17.351
If it's over, then just say it's over.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.391
Kingsley, it's over.

07:19.440 --> 07:21.908
What the fuck?.!

07:21.960 --> 07:24.633
You're breaking up with me
the day before my finals?.!

07:24.680 --> 07:28.389
Look at this! With the colours, look!

07:28.440 --> 07:29.714
Blue, accretion.

07:29.760 --> 07:30.909
Red, lithology.

07:30.960 --> 07:32.234
Yellow, turbidity.

07:32.280 --> 07:36.034
Do you see any colours on here
that signify emotional turmoil?.!

07:37.360 --> 07:39.078
- No.
- No, because I don't have time for it!

07:39.120 --> 07:41.395
Great, now I've got a migraine.

07:41.440 --> 07:44.000
- I'm sorry, Kingsley...
- Well, you've ruined my life.

07:44.040 --> 07:45.758
So thanks for that.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.756
So, go on.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.233
Fuck off.

07:49.280 --> 07:50.599
- Don't you want to talk about it?.
- I don't ever

07:50.640 --> 07:53.359
want to talk to you ever again,
you evil fucking woman!

07:53.400 --> 07:56.312
I love you. Please stay with me
until after my finals.

07:56.360 --> 07:58.078
Good luck with your exams.

opening packages all day?.

ten minutes to open a parcel.

Aww, your mum sent you a care package!

so you can move back home with me."

- Nothing.
- What did you say?.

10:54.800 --> 10:55.949
What?.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.912
I said...

10:58.960 --> 11:03.795
is it about your libido?.
Because you've got such a...

11:03.840 --> 11:05.512
high libido.

11:05.560 --> 11:07.994
Why would she break up with me
because I've got a high libido?.

11:08.040 --> 11:09.871
Because...

11:09.920 --> 11:11.478
it's...

came from. I have got mug punters

12:00.280 --> 12:03.875
The mooring is not fine!
The mooring is untenable!

12:03.920 --> 12:06.957
- The mooring is perfectly tenable!
- I'm not happy with the mooring,

12:07.000 --> 12:08.877
so we are leaving
and finding a new mooring

12:08.920 --> 12:10.751

fucking Utah about setting a lake on fire,

12:45.480 --> 12:47.994
cos that's the sort of thing you do
the day before your finals,

12:48.040 --> 12:51.237
and he says we can get
a giant submersible butane manifold.

12:51.280 --> 12:53.748
Obviously, we'll need to
clear the lake first -

12:53.800 --> 12:56.758
- ducks, geese, mallards.
- Mmm,

12:56.800 --> 13:00.031
- no-one wants a goose inferno.
- Best way to scare ducks, apparently,

13:00.080 --> 13:02.640
cos I really have time to research this
now, during my revision,

13:02.680 --> 13:07.231
is to hire some hawks
from a local falconry centre,

13:07.280 --> 13:10.317
so apparently, for a lake the size
of Worthington, we need about six,

13:10.360 --> 13:12.669
with handlers and a kestrel.

13:12.720 --> 13:15.678
- How much is that, then?.
- It's 1 2 grand for the burner,

13:15.720 --> 13:18.439
1,500 for a 60-litre industrial
butane canister,

13:18.480 --> 13:21.995
plus 600 quid each for a couple
of qualified frogmen who plumb it all in,

13:22.040 --> 13:25.669
so with the hawks, the manifold,
the diffuser and petrol for the frogmen,

13:25.720 --> 13:28.393
it's £1 8,000.

- You got involved

23:43.600 --> 23:46.717
with the Manchester drug lords,
the lords of the drug lords?.!

23:46.760 --> 23:50.230
Drug dealers?.!
Vod, have you seen The Wire?.

23:50.280 --> 23:52.953
Because I haven't,
but I can fucking imagine!

23:53.000 --> 23:55.070
I'm starting to feel a mite jittery,

23:55.120 --> 23:59.671
so I'm just gonna lie flat
on the cold, hard ground.

23:59.720 --> 24:01.517
Yeah.

24:01.560 --> 24:03.312
Look, it's just one of those things
that happens,

24:03.360 --> 24:05.920
- isn't it?.
- No, Vod, it isn't.

24:05.960 --> 24:08.030
Washing your jeans
with a tissue in the pocket,

24:08.080 --> 24:11.277
or accidentally ordering a large jar
of olives from the Ocado shop,

24:11.320 --> 24:13.914
but getting raided by dealers
the night before

24:13.960 --> 24:16.030
- your fucking finals?.!
- I'm calling the rozzers,

24:16.080 --> 24:19.197
getting them to wazz round here
and roz up all the crimmos.

24:19.240 --> 24:21.276
Er, actually,
I'd prefer it if you didn't, mate.

24:21.320 --> 24:24.471
He is a dealer and I am kind of
up to my nips in this,

24:24.520 --> 24:26.795
- so...
- Am I up to my nips as well?.

24:26.840 --> 24:29.274
- No!
- Am I nipple-deep by association?.

24:31.160 --> 24:33.390
- There's no signal.
- OK, Vod, you are going up there

24:33.440 --> 24:34.793
and you are giving them the money.

24:34.840 --> 24:36.671
Actually, I can't.

24:36.720 --> 24:38.278
It is 60 grand!

24:38.320 --> 24:39.833
Look, I know it's a wrench.

24:39.880 --> 24:42.599
I remember when I had to take out
75K from my trusty

24:42.640 --> 24:44.119
as an endowment on this place.

24:44.160 --> 24:46.799
I nearly had a fucking nosebleed
in Bradford & Bingley.

24:46.840 --> 24:49.070
What about the Grad Ball, yeah?.

24:49.120 --> 24:52.715
No cash means...
you know, no Lake Of Fire.

24:52.760 --> 24:54.318
All those disappointed punters.

24:54.360 --> 24:57.830
- I mean...
- MOLE: Where the fuck is it?.!

24:57.880 --> 25:00.519
- We give them a bit of it.
- Yeah,

25:00.560 --> 25:01.993
er, I'm gonna be honest with you, Jose.

25:02.040 --> 25:04.190
I don't think Mole's the kind
of gentlemen that will come down here,

25:04.240 --> 25:06.629
help himself to a grand
and leave without the other 59.

25:06.680 --> 25:09.990
Well, we can't stay here!
We've got our finals in the morning!

25:10.040 --> 25:11.917
It'll only be a couple of hours!

25:11.960 --> 25:15.555
In my experience, nine times out of ten,
these things just blow over.

25:15.600 --> 25:18.319
MOLE: Vod! Listen, girl,
I'm not fucking around!

25:18.360 --> 25:20.828
Oh, right, and that's from the
Office for National Statistics, is it?.!

25:20.880 --> 25:24.589
Mole, mate, are you a fan of
expressionism?. Because in my dresser,

25:24.640 --> 25:29.668
second drawer down, you will find
a sketch by a certain Lucian Freud.

25:29.720 --> 25:31.597
(CRASHlNG UPSTAlRS)

25:31.640 --> 25:33.153
- Mole?.
- Tell you what,

25:33.200 --> 25:34.872
if we make it out of this alive...

25:34.920 --> 25:36.956
- lf?.!
- I said "when"!

25:38.400 --> 25:39.958
- Hundred quid each.
- Oh, yeah, great,

25:40.000 --> 25:42.719
well, that'll make up for the loss of
earnings when we all fail our finals(!)

25:42.760 --> 25:45.399
I can use it to buy
a big velvet dunce cap.

25:45.440 --> 25:48.000
- Vod, give them the money!
- Yeah, Vod, stop fucking around!

25:48.040 --> 25:49.917
Will everyone just shut the fuck up
about it for a minute, OK?.!

25:49.960 --> 25:53.430
I am not giving them my money.

25:53.480 --> 25:56.074
You know he's probably up there,
stealing all our stuff.

25:56.120 --> 25:57.951
He's probably gonna take
my fucking 1 2-string.

25:58.000 --> 26:02.039
MOLE: Right,
we're not leaving till we've found it.

26:07.360 --> 26:12.115
- TV: Come right in. How do you do?.
- (APPLAUSE ON TV)

26:14.640 --> 26:16.198
He's watching TV.

26:16.240 --> 26:19.596
What's he watching?. Something mellow?.

26:19.640 --> 26:22.029
What time is Mr Selfridge on?.
Maybe we could

26:22.080 --> 26:23.877
- encourage him to watch that.
- Vod, if you don't give him

26:23.920 --> 26:26.992
his money soon,
I am gonna fail my finals.

26:27.040 --> 26:29.634
Well, I've eaten a whole bag of dried
cranberries and I'm gonna need to...

26:29.680 --> 26:32.035
well, shit them out pretty soon.

26:32.080 --> 26:33.957
Come on, it's exciting!

26:34.000 --> 26:36.992
It's like that film with Ben Stiller
and the, er, dinosaur.

26:37.040 --> 26:40.032
No, Vod, it's nothing like
Night At The fucking Museum.

26:40.080 --> 26:41.638
It is like Night At The Museum.

26:41.680 --> 26:42.954
JOSlE: Aww, remember this?.

26:44.040 --> 26:45.189
Hello, old friend.

26:45.240 --> 26:48.152
God, that really puts the last three years
into perspective!

26:48.200 --> 26:49.269
Back then, he was just

26:49.320 --> 26:52.118
a light entertainer, and now he's
a genuinely heavyweight polemicist.

26:52.160 --> 26:55.072
Like, relative to what?.

26:56.120 --> 26:57.838
My libido.

26:57.880 --> 27:01.395
- (SlGHS) Seriously, Kingsley!
- I'm just asking.

27:01.440 --> 27:05.911
Relative to what?. A chimp scraping
his dick against a mango tree?.

27:05.960 --> 27:09.794
- I don't know! Relative to... normal.
- So, subnormal.

27:09.840 --> 27:12.718
Can I claim benefits?.
Can I get a special badge for my car?.

27:12.760 --> 27:15.354
- My libido's disabled.
- Your libido is not disabled.

27:15.400 --> 27:18.198
If you'd just be my girlfriend
for the nex nine and a half hours...

27:18.240 --> 27:20.549
- Pity the poor eunuch.
- Kingsley,

27:20.600 --> 27:23.239
I'm not going to be
your inflatable-ripcord girlfriend -

27:23.280 --> 27:25.635
"ln case of emergency, insert penis here!"

27:26.640 --> 27:28.790
Mole, mate?. Me again.

27:28.840 --> 27:33.709
If you give me your sort code, account
number and a copy of your passport,

27:33.760 --> 27:38.595
I will gladly transfer over to you
a sizeable portion of my premium bonds.

27:38.640 --> 27:39.914
Right, Vod, give them the money.

27:39.960 --> 27:43.077
- I need a poo.
- Howard, have you got a bucket?.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.588
Of course I've got a bucket.
I can't vouch for its provenance, though.

27:47.840 --> 27:49.239
I'm not shitting in a bucket.

27:49.280 --> 27:50.872
- Advanced physics?.
- Oh, yeah.

27:50.920 --> 27:53.832
It's, er, funny you mention that,
actually,

27:53.880 --> 27:57.589
because I'm dropping out
of my geology degree

27:57.640 --> 28:00.791
and applying to study physics
commencing September.

28:00.840 --> 28:02.990
Howard, are you doing it again?.

28:03.040 --> 28:04.109
Absolutely not!

28:04.160 --> 28:05.798
- That's a ludicrous slur!
- I'm just saying

28:05.840 --> 28:08.593
that every three years,
you do tend to go a bit Coco Pops

28:08.640 --> 28:10.198
the night before your finals.

28:10.240 --> 28:14.313
Thank you for your psychoanalysis,
Miss Carl Jung(!)

28:14.360 --> 28:15.554
Do you have the fear?.

28:15.600 --> 28:18.512
- The fear of what?.
- Moving to London

28:18.560 --> 28:20.994
and having your pants pulled down
in Regent's Park.

28:21.040 --> 28:23.395
- That's ridiculous!
- Howard, you can't drop out now.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.032
You're being a dick.

28:25.080 --> 28:26.798
- Right, you lot?.
- Right.

28:26.840 --> 28:27.955
I don't know.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.070
No, I'm just saying that...

28:32.240 --> 28:35.516
...three more years at Medlock
does have a ring to it.

28:35.560 --> 28:36.879
God, you're just trying to clip his wings

28:36.920 --> 28:39.434
cos you're scared
of getting left on your own.

28:39.480 --> 28:42.711
Oh, that is low, Kingsley!
That is relatively low!

28:42.760 --> 28:45.433
- Oh, fuck off, Josie.
- JP: Hey, mate.

28:45.480 --> 28:47.596
- Easy on Jose, OK?.
- What's it matter to you?.

28:48.800 --> 28:50.518
Nothing.

28:54.800 --> 28:57.951
Oh, my God! You're fucking!

28:58.000 --> 29:00.514
- (SCOFFS)
- Look, Kingo, don't freak out.

29:00.560 --> 29:01.754
Don't freak out?.

29:01.800 --> 29:03.199
Oh, yeah, OK, fine,

29:03.240 --> 29:07.711
because whenever anyone says that,
it's always good news(!)

29:07.760 --> 29:09.990
We were just shagging, that's all.

29:10.040 --> 29:13.396
That's all?. Well, that is all.
That is all there is.

29:13.440 --> 29:16.910
I wouldn't even call it shagging,
it was more like... bonking.

29:16.960 --> 29:19.520
Yeah, bonking.
You can't go mad about bonking.

29:19.560 --> 29:23.189
It's fun, it's smutty,
it's Sid James and Babs Windsor.

29:23.240 --> 29:24.468
So that's why you were entering
his bedroom

29:24.520 --> 29:26.556
- at 3.20 every morning. Ah!
- (WHlSPERS) Howard!

29:26.600 --> 29:28.431
Amazing! Even Howard knew!

29:29.640 --> 29:32.791
I mean, he doesn't understand it,
but he's got the raw fucking data.

29:32.840 --> 29:34.398
Did everyone know?.

29:34.440 --> 29:35.555
Sorry, mate.

29:35.600 --> 29:39.309
Jose told us right just before
she cold-cocked me in the truth tent.

29:39.360 --> 29:42.318
Also, I feel like I knew before I knew,
if you know what I mean,

29:42.360 --> 29:45.033
Iike, I kind of tend to assume
that she's either riding you

29:45.080 --> 29:46.752
or you at any given moment.

29:46.800 --> 29:49.155
Does anyone else want to emotionally
violate me the day before my finals?.

29:50.400 --> 29:55.076
I mean, really, does anyone else
want to take a shit in my mouth?.

29:58.160 --> 29:59.912
Now, why can't I see my hands?.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.878
My palms are swirly. I can't...
I can't see my hands.

30:07.560 --> 30:09.755
- I'm fucking blind.
- Just...

30:09.800 --> 30:11.199
don't be a drama queen.

30:11.240 --> 30:14.994
That, Kingsley, is an ocular migraine
brought on by stress.

30:15.040 --> 30:16.951
I had one when they switched off Teletex.

30:18.280 --> 30:22.398
Well, so... I'm... I'm blind.
Thank you, Josie.

30:22.440 --> 30:24.431
- Thank you for making me go blind.
- What about JP?.!

30:24.480 --> 30:26.675
He gets half the blame.
He gets one eye!

30:26.720 --> 30:28.995
(GROANS) Oh, tummy cramps!

30:29.040 --> 30:30.393
Oh, great, so that's my stool cycle

30:30.440 --> 30:32.237
interrupted before my exams.
Cheers, Vod(!)

30:32.280 --> 30:33.998
JOSlE: Kingsley, it was nothing.

30:34.040 --> 30:36.679
- It was a one-off.
- Well...

30:36.720 --> 30:39.154
- a series of one-offs.
- That have come to an end.

30:39.200 --> 30:41.760
- Very recently.
- Very finally.

30:41.800 --> 30:44.837
- I mean, seven days clean.
- You know,

30:44.880 --> 30:47.599
it's funny. I don't remember your moaning
that much when we were doing it.

30:47.640 --> 30:53.192
Oh, sorry, my mistake. Yes, I do.
Oh!...Oh!...Oh!

30:53.240 --> 30:54.389
- Shut up, JP!
- Yeah,

30:54.440 --> 30:57.591
shut up! Because that's just the way
you like me, isn't it, Jose?.

30:57.640 --> 31:00.598
Silent, compliant JP.

31:00.640 --> 31:03.279
The big, disgusting dildo.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.038
Well, how's that?.

31:05.080 --> 31:07.310
(MUFFLED) Is that quiet enough
for you, eh?.

31:07.360 --> 31:09.237
If he's making this about him,
it's not about him.

31:09.280 --> 31:12.352
- It's not about you, JP.
- (MUFFLED) You know what?. I like you!

31:12.400 --> 31:15.870
There! I like you! Deal with that.

31:15.920 --> 31:19.799
- No, you fucking don't!
- But it doesn't matter. (COUGHS)

31:19.840 --> 31:23.674
Because Tomothy has got me a job
in London and I'm going to move there,

31:23.720 --> 31:25.438
so you're never going to have to
see me again.

31:27.120 --> 31:29.395
- You're going to work for Tomothy?.
- Yes.

31:29.440 --> 31:33.228
He's...offered me a badly-paid position
doing something that I will hate

31:33.280 --> 31:34.713
and I have accepted.

31:34.760 --> 31:37.672
I knew it! I knew you were gonna
end up like one of them.

31:37.720 --> 31:39.358
I mean, you held out for,
like, 20 minutes,

31:39.400 --> 31:41.960
- but I knew it!
- They're gonna ride me, Josie.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.718
Do you understand?.

31:43.760 --> 31:46.069
They're going to ride me
round and round that office

31:46.120 --> 31:48.111
Iike one of those novelty mini-motorbikes.

31:48.160 --> 31:50.310
- Then why are you doing it?.
- Because...

31:52.040 --> 31:54.793
-...what other choice do I have?.
- Oh, my God!

31:54.840 --> 31:56.876
You wanna play the pity game?.!

31:56.920 --> 31:59.309
Yeah?. Well, here's my hand.

31:59.360 --> 32:02.591
I'm blind, I don't have a girlfriend,
I don't have any books,

32:02.640 --> 32:06.235
I've got my finals tomorrow,
I've got a relatively low libido.

32:06.280 --> 32:09.511
In fact, while I'm at it,
some more squat thrusts, I think...

32:11.000 --> 32:13.389
...which, of course,
only exacerbate my migraine.

32:13.440 --> 32:18.150
- God! I love my life(!)
- Oh, stop fucking whining, Kingsley!

32:18.200 --> 32:19.599
You're such a little bitch.

32:19.640 --> 32:22.359
I have cause to moan, Josie.

32:22.400 --> 32:24.960
You can either sit around
feeling sorry for yourself

32:25.000 --> 32:26.877
or you can get up
and do some revision!

32:26.920 --> 32:31.118
How?. I don't have any books
and I'm blind!

32:31.160 --> 32:33.435
Do you think that stopped Stevie Wonder,
Kingsley?.

32:33.480 --> 32:34.799
He did not go blind

32:34.840 --> 32:37.673
- the night before his geology finals!
- Right...

32:37.720 --> 32:40.598
I am gonna to get you through this...

32:40.640 --> 32:43.438
because I consider myself to be...

32:45.200 --> 32:47.555
...a kind of mother hen to you all.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.991
Don't, because you will make me cry.

32:51.040 --> 32:52.871
Oh, shut up, Josie!

32:54.480 --> 32:55.993
Sorry, but this isn't about you.

32:56.040 --> 33:00.079
You're always sticking your beak in,
like a big Welsh heron. Just...

33:00.120 --> 33:03.396
(SQUAWKS)

33:04.640 --> 33:05.755
Well, that's nice, isn't it(??)

33:05.800 --> 33:08.837
God! Don't you have
your own life to sort out?.

33:10.880 --> 33:13.997
(STAMMERS) l... I...was just...

33:14.040 --> 33:17.032
trying to help, actually,
because I'm gonna be

33:17.080 --> 33:20.152
stuck here nex year on my own
and I was just trying to be a good friend

33:20.200 --> 33:22.714
because I wanted to help you all out
cos I'm such a good friend

33:22.760 --> 33:25.991
and I'm such a good friend that
I have to tell you, actually, Oregon,

33:26.040 --> 33:28.679
that you're not getting your Fulbright

33:28.720 --> 33:32.030
because I'm a really good friend
and you need to face up to reality

33:32.080 --> 33:34.548
because I'm a really, really, really
good friend.

33:40.400 --> 33:41.435
You opened it?.

33:43.360 --> 33:45.874
I think I might open a window.

33:45.920 --> 33:49.037
- I might just hide behind this box.
- I'm a really, really good friend.

33:49.080 --> 33:51.833
Basically,
I'm a really, really good friend.

33:51.880 --> 33:53.711

34:00.520 --> 34:01.669
(CONTlNUES TO SOB)

34:11.040 --> 34:15.351
ROSS KEMP ON TV: Can you tell me
about what a taxman would do to...

34:16.639 --> 34:20.428
He's watching Ross Kemp,
so that's gonna get him all riled.

34:20.480 --> 34:23.630
- Give them the money, Vod.
- Yeah, Vod, give them the money.

34:23.679 --> 34:26.513
He's getting tired up there,
I can sense it.

34:26.560 --> 34:28.994
All that ransacking, it does you in.

34:30.040 --> 34:31.359
I'm back to one eye.

34:32.520 --> 34:35.034
I'm basically going into my finals
as a Cyclops.

34:35.080 --> 34:38.152
God, I'm gonna end up
moving back home, aren't l?.

34:38.199 --> 34:39.792
Me, living with my mum,

34:39.840 --> 34:45.039
- washing her massive beige bras.
- Howard, I was being stupid.

34:46.080 --> 34:50.277
You can't start again
and you can't stay at university forever.

34:50.320 --> 34:51.753
Ultimately, that remains to be seen.

34:51.800 --> 34:53.027
VOD: Do you know what, Howard?.

34:53.080 --> 34:54.672
You're not even that weird.

34:54.719 --> 34:56.710
Not any more.

34:56.760 --> 34:58.910
I mean, you are still
a little bit weird, l...

34:59.960 --> 35:02.428
... I did see you eating that moth
about three months ago.

35:02.480 --> 35:05.040
JOSlE: Yeah, I mean, when I first met you,

35:05.080 --> 35:09.517
I used to dread spending three seconds
with you, but now,

35:09.560 --> 35:13.838
I could go, I dunno,
up to 50 minutes in your company

35:13.880 --> 35:15.871
before I needed just a little break.

35:15.920 --> 35:17.956
But what if I flounder?.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.956
What if I forget to swipe my Oyster card

35:20.000 --> 35:22.070
and Transport for London
chooses to make an example of me?.

35:22.120 --> 35:26.352
What if I get mugged every day by the
same guy who can't stop mugging me

35:26.400 --> 35:29.836
- because I'm insanely muggable?.
- JP: Howard...

35:31.080 --> 35:32.195
...you're ready.

35:33.320 --> 35:37.233
- (THUDDlNG)
- MOLE: Right, Vod, time's up, girl.

35:37.280 --> 35:38.269
Give us the money

35:38.320 --> 35:40.595
- or we're smashing the guitar.
- What guitar?.

35:40.640 --> 35:41.789
Which guitar?.

35:42.840 --> 35:45.070
Come on, Mole!

35:45.120 --> 35:47.793
- Don't be such a prick!
- Don't agitate him.

35:47.840 --> 35:49.319
He's all hopped up on Ross Kemp.

35:49.360 --> 35:51.396
Is it the Tanglewood or the Yamaha?.

35:51.440 --> 35:54.238
Could you just look at the headstock
and read it out to me?.

35:54.280 --> 35:56.191
Enough's enough, Vod!
just give them the money!

35:56.240 --> 35:59.471
I cannot stress highly enough
how much I need a poo.

36:00.600 --> 36:03.160
- It is 60 grand!
- MOLE: Vod, listen, girl.

36:03.200 --> 36:06.192
- I'm not fucking about.
- You're not going to do this.

36:06.240 --> 36:10.711
Look me in the eye, this eye...
and tell me you're going to do this.

36:10.760 --> 36:12.193
Vod, just forget about

36:12.240 --> 36:14.196
- the fucking Grad Ball! Who cares?.
- Look,

36:14.240 --> 36:16.515
- this isn't about the ball, all right?.
- (MOLE SHOUTS)

36:16.560 --> 36:18.198
I need this money cos...

36:19.200 --> 36:22.795
...you know, it's my finals tomorrow
and I'm about to fuck 'em up!

36:22.840 --> 36:26.310
- No, you're not.
- No, I need a fallback option.

36:26.360 --> 36:28.920
I don't have a Merkel, not me.

36:28.960 --> 36:30.439
I've got no-one.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.869
- You've got us.
- No, this is real money.

36:32.920 --> 36:34.876
I could do something with this.

36:34.920 --> 36:36.831
MOLE: I'm cutting the guitar strings, Vod!

36:38.440 --> 36:40.032
No, that's it.

36:40.080 --> 36:42.071
- Gone again.
- No, I mean,

36:42.120 --> 36:45.192
when am I ever gonna get 60 grand again
in my life?.

36:45.240 --> 36:47.276
Vod, please don't screw up
our finals for us!

36:47.320 --> 36:48.594
(STRlNG TWANGS)

36:48.640 --> 36:50.358
- Argh!
- MOLE: Right, last chance, Vod,

36:50.400 --> 36:52.391
or I'm smashing the shit out of it!

36:52.440 --> 36:53.953
- Three...

- Two...

36:55.240 --> 36:57.549
Do something, Vod!
He's about to have a fucking stroke!

36:57.600 --> 36:59.079
Oh-h!

36:59.120 --> 37:05.673
MOLE: Vod, I'm not fucking messing, love!
Where the fuck is it?.

37:08.280 --> 37:10.555
- Vod!
- All right, I'm coming!

37:14.160 --> 37:18.995
- Just take it, you dirty monster!
- Nice one. Sorry for bothering you.

TV: You've got the cooker, you've got the
washing machine, the hairdryer. Now...

37:27.560 --> 37:28.709
Thanks, Vod.

37:30.120 --> 37:31.109
No worries.

37:32.320 --> 37:33.594
You would've done the same for me.

37:37.240 --> 37:41.119
OK, so, I've got a geology exam
I should probably cram for.

37:41.160 --> 37:42.878
OK, I think I'm gonna just... Yeah.

everyone got quite nutty
down in the cellar.

No, l...definitely don't like you.

37:59.280 --> 38:02.352
Good, because I definitely don't like you.

Well, that's, er...

38:06.720 --> 38:09.029
...worked out pretty tooting perfectly.
