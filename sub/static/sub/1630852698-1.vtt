WEBVTT

00:20.311 --> 00:21.187
Your hand.

00:25.525 --> 00:26.359
Did you slit it?

00:27.485 --> 00:28.653
To kill yourself?

00:29.779 --> 00:32.991
I heard you named me in your note.
That you want to die because of me.

00:33.074 --> 00:33.908
I'm sorry.

00:33.992 --> 00:36.161
-What a piece of shit.
-You fucker.

00:36.244 --> 00:38.872
If you transfer afterward,
how would that make me look?

00:38.955 --> 00:40.290
Have I ever hit you?

00:40.373 --> 00:41.374
No, never.

00:42.375 --> 00:43.793
Damn right, I didn't. Fuck.

00:44.753 --> 00:45.628
Hey.

00:50.633 --> 00:51.593
Hey.

00:52.677 --> 00:53.553
Hey.

00:54.262 --> 00:56.306
You asshole.

00:56.389 --> 00:57.891
-Look at me, asshole.
-Sorry, Gwi-nam.

01:01.770 --> 01:04.606
-Stop.
-Hey, Jin-su.

01:05.106 --> 01:06.941
Please stop!

01:08.902 --> 01:10.153
Cut that shit out.

01:13.156 --> 01:14.824
-You motherfucker.
-What the…

01:16.826 --> 01:17.869
Look at you.

01:19.788 --> 01:22.749
Get up. Fuck! You dipshit!

01:25.668 --> 01:27.629
-Hey, it's splashing all over me!
-Shit!

01:28.671 --> 01:30.173
This asshole.

01:30.673 --> 01:32.926
This fucker.
Have you gone mental or something?

01:41.559 --> 01:42.894
Asshole.

01:42.977 --> 01:47.023
Fuck you, you fucking bastard.

01:51.069 --> 01:51.986
Fuck.

02:07.252 --> 02:08.753
Hey, stop it. Stop.

02:09.587 --> 02:12.423
This bastard pisses me off.

02:17.971 --> 02:18.930
You little shit.

02:20.849 --> 02:21.766
Gwi-nam, help me!

02:22.642 --> 02:24.435
Stop it already. Fuck.

02:41.452 --> 02:42.871
What? You scared?

02:43.580 --> 02:45.665
No. I'm not scared.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.458
Yeah, right.

02:54.632 --> 02:55.466
Damn it.

02:56.426 --> 02:58.052
His BP is okay, but he's lethargic.

02:58.928 --> 03:00.680
He has severe cerebral edema.
I suspect TBI,

03:00.763 --> 03:03.975
and tenderness in his left thorax
and side suggests abdominal bleeding.

03:04.058 --> 03:06.477
I'll transfer him right away
for emergency surgery.

03:06.561 --> 03:09.355
If he can't get surgery
within an hour, he'll be DOA.

03:09.939 --> 03:10.815
Yes.

03:11.316 --> 03:13.818
We'll intubate him,
put in a C-line, then send him over.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.320
Yes.

03:16.112 --> 03:16.988
Okay.

03:18.156 --> 03:21.159
What's taking them so long?
I called a while ago.

03:22.827 --> 03:24.412
RESTRICTED AREA

03:38.968 --> 03:39.802
Dad.

03:42.722 --> 03:43.932
Are they okay?

03:45.808 --> 03:47.518
-What?
-Sorry, Dad.

03:48.186 --> 03:49.395
I know it was wrong,

03:50.605 --> 03:52.106
but I wanted to kill them.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.819
I'm sorry. It'll never happen again.

03:58.321 --> 03:59.239
It's okay.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.074
Is it really okay?

04:01.157 --> 04:02.617
It'll all be okay.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.452
What will be okay?

04:04.535 --> 04:05.662
Everything.

04:08.206 --> 04:09.207
All of it.

04:09.999 --> 04:11.626
Has anything gotten better?

04:14.170 --> 04:15.296
Why won't you answer me?

04:16.714 --> 04:18.383
Has anything gotten better?

04:20.009 --> 04:22.845
Either I have to die or they do.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.931
It won't get better until somebody dies.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.396
-Jin-su.
-Let go!

04:32.105 --> 04:34.440
I'm going to kill those assholes.

04:37.735 --> 04:38.569
Stop it, Jin-su.

04:38.653 --> 04:39.821
Let go!

04:41.030 --> 04:44.409
Jin-su. I'll fix everything, so stop.

04:44.492 --> 04:46.160
Do you want to die too?

04:47.578 --> 04:48.788
Should I kill you?

04:48.871 --> 04:50.999
Please, stop it!

05:17.191 --> 05:18.401
I'm sorry, Jin-su.

05:21.654 --> 05:25.325
HOLY BIBLE

05:25.408 --> 05:26.743
I love you.

06:16.584 --> 06:17.960

TEACHERS' OFFICE

07:37.373 --> 07:38.458
Hello.

07:38.541 --> 07:39.709
Hi.

07:43.921 --> 07:46.674
-Ms. Jung. I'll head out first.
-See you tomorrow.

07:46.757 --> 07:47.633
-Okay.
-Bye.

07:47.717 --> 07:48.759
See you.

07:51.929 --> 07:52.763
Goodbye, ma'am.

07:52.847 --> 07:55.183
Keep up the good work.
Don't forget to do your homework.

07:55.266 --> 07:56.267
-I won't.
-Good.

08:06.402 --> 08:07.487
Good afternoon.

08:07.570 --> 08:10.615
The seemingly never-ending heat
has finally died down.

08:10.698 --> 08:15.661
The muggy, scorching heat
has been replaced by a fresh, cool breeze.

08:15.745 --> 08:18.956
Today, we'll talk about
an interesting study.

08:19.540 --> 08:22.168
A psychologist in the US
conducted a study.

08:22.752 --> 08:25.379
He gathered 48 men and women
who had never met before.

08:25.463 --> 08:26.881
To one group, he gave…

08:30.384 --> 08:32.178
You should have scored a goal.
It's your fault we lost.

08:32.261 --> 08:34.639
Hey. You should've passed it better.

08:34.722 --> 08:35.973
Take that.

08:37.850 --> 08:38.809
Hey.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.853
Okay. Hey, I'm throwing this away now.

08:45.858 --> 08:48.361
Where are you going? Wait for me!

08:50.154 --> 08:51.113
What are you doing?

08:52.406 --> 08:53.491
Moron.

08:57.578 --> 09:00.331
WE ROOT FOR
THE HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL ARCHERY TEAM

09:27.567 --> 09:30.194
-I'm hungry. Let's go eat tteokbokki.
-Again?

09:30.278 --> 09:31.445
Shouldn't we wake Hyeon-ju up?

09:31.529 --> 09:33.698
-But it's yummy.
-Leave her. She'll just snap at us.

09:41.414 --> 09:44.375
I told them to wake me up. Those jerks.

10:12.778 --> 10:13.863
What the heck?

11:15.841 --> 11:16.842
Hey.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.180
Hey.

11:22.556 --> 11:23.641
Come here.

11:25.559 --> 11:26.977
Where are you going?

11:28.020 --> 11:29.897
Damn it. This little rat is defiant.

11:30.398 --> 11:31.399
Hey.

11:33.275 --> 11:34.276
Hey.

11:35.027 --> 11:36.028
Hey.

11:41.367 --> 11:42.827
What the hell? You little shit.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.137
What are you doing here?

12:02.596 --> 12:05.266
Nothing. It bit me. So annoying.

12:05.349 --> 12:06.225
Goodbye.

12:19.321 --> 12:21.866
I heard your restaurant moved.
How about a grand opening?

12:21.949 --> 12:22.950
We're not having one.

12:23.033 --> 12:24.952
What? Why not?

12:25.536 --> 12:26.495
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

12:26.579 --> 12:28.706
Seriously? I told them to change the name.

12:28.789 --> 12:30.207
I heard you were.

12:30.291 --> 12:33.335
We're not.
The fryer hasn't even come in yet.

12:33.419 --> 12:34.587
I heard it had.

12:34.670 --> 12:36.797
MOM: WHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE?
CHEONG-SAN: TAKE MY NAME OUT.

12:36.881 --> 12:38.924
I'd know better than you, don't you think?

12:39.008 --> 12:40.342
MOM: OKAY. SO WHICH ONE?
CHEONG-SAN: MOM…

12:40.426 --> 12:42.052
My mom's impossible.

12:44.096 --> 12:45.681
Hey. My phone!

12:45.765 --> 12:47.016
You can't run away.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.144
Hey, gopher.
Let's go have some fried chicken.

12:50.227 --> 12:51.437
It hasn't even opened yet.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.523
It has. She said she's testing out
a new recipe today.

12:55.483 --> 12:56.484
You're going, right?

12:56.567 --> 12:57.526
Of course.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.113
-Are you coming too?
-Sure.

13:01.197 --> 13:02.907
Your mom told On-jo to bring friends.

13:02.990 --> 13:04.700
Is this a double date?

13:05.284 --> 13:06.452
What the hell? Annoying.

13:07.328 --> 13:09.121
What's going on? We're not opening today.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.457
What do you know? Let's go, gopher.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.757
-Do you like it that much?
-You bet. I'm going to eat so much.

13:22.551 --> 13:23.511
This is so much!

13:24.845 --> 13:25.846
Thank you.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.473
-Thank you.
-It looks so good.

13:27.556 --> 13:28.599
Why so much?

13:28.682 --> 13:30.392
On-jo eats a lot.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.686
I don't eat a lot. I eat well.

13:32.770 --> 13:35.898
Yes, that's what I like the best.
Eat up, Gyeong-su.

13:35.981 --> 13:37.900
-Thank you.
-You too, A-sak.

13:39.193 --> 13:40.945
It's I-sak, not A-sak.

13:41.028 --> 13:42.112
Did you change your name?

13:43.489 --> 13:44.573
Yes?

13:44.657 --> 13:47.952
Mom. Don't change someone else's name.
Change the restaurant's name.

13:48.035 --> 13:51.789
-Why are you using my name?
-It was called that before you were born.

13:51.872 --> 13:54.792
Exactly. You named me
after the restaurant.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.710
-I don't like--
-Hey. Quiet.

13:56.794 --> 13:58.879
I like it. It has authenticity.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.381
-Right?
-Of course.

14:00.464 --> 14:01.924
-He's right.
-He's right.

14:02.591 --> 14:06.011
So this is a new recipe that we made.

14:06.095 --> 14:09.723
This is slightly hot,
and this is very hot.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.016
What do you think?

14:11.100 --> 14:13.227
You have to be honest.

14:14.937 --> 14:17.273
It's super-crazy-mad good.

14:17.898 --> 14:18.858
It's delicious.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.818
-Really?
-Ma'am!

14:20.901 --> 14:24.572
Right. If you need a delivery boy,
I'll do it for cheap.

14:24.655 --> 14:26.532
You guys need to study.

14:27.616 --> 14:29.159
On-jo. Is it too hot?

14:30.911 --> 14:31.745
It's salty.

14:31.829 --> 14:32.788
It's salty?

14:34.874 --> 14:36.750
What about this one? Is it very hot?

14:37.376 --> 14:38.711
No. It's salty.

14:39.336 --> 14:40.880
Why is it salty? That's bad.

14:41.380 --> 14:42.298
Honey!

14:42.381 --> 14:44.258
-Yes?
-She says it's salty.

14:45.134 --> 14:46.051
It's salty?

14:46.135 --> 14:48.220
-On-jo says it's salty.
-Why?

14:48.304 --> 14:49.513
-That can't be.
-It's good.

14:49.597 --> 14:51.640
-Did you make it extra salty?
-It's good.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.392
-Yes, it is.
-It tastes good to me.

14:53.475 --> 14:54.685
Let me try.

14:55.311 --> 14:57.104
Stop eating. You said it's salty.

14:57.688 --> 14:59.064
But it still tastes good.

15:03.444 --> 15:04.695
Ah, right.

15:04.778 --> 15:07.156
Did you hear about
the science teacher, Mr. Lee?

15:08.115 --> 15:09.491
What about him?

15:09.575 --> 15:11.035
He smells like a rotting corpse.

15:11.118 --> 15:11.952
Jeez.

15:12.036 --> 15:13.746
Na-yeon spread that rumor, right?

15:13.829 --> 15:17.249
It's true. He didn't come to school
for a few days after his son went missing.

15:17.333 --> 15:18.542
Then he came to class and…

15:18.626 --> 15:19.960
Rock, paper, scissors for it?

15:20.044 --> 15:22.838
-Rock, paper, scissors!
-I'm not playing.

15:25.799 --> 15:27.176
…he smelled like a rotting corpse.

15:27.259 --> 15:29.261
How would she know what that smells like?

15:29.345 --> 15:30.846
Has she smelled one before?

15:31.555 --> 15:34.141
She knows every smell except that one.

15:34.683 --> 15:37.853
Since she never smelled it before,
that must be it.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.314
He became weird
ever since his son went missing.

15:40.397 --> 15:41.565
His son was an outcast.

15:42.691 --> 15:44.318
I heard he got bullied badly.

15:44.902 --> 15:46.612
Yes. I feel sorry for him.

15:47.196 --> 15:48.656
I feel sorry for Mr. Lee too.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.951
Remember last week
when he left during class?

-Did the bell ring?

16:30.906 --> 16:32.574
-What was that?
-What did he write?

16:32.658 --> 16:34.076
He'd never done that before.

16:34.952 --> 16:36.829
They say he was a genius.

16:36.912 --> 16:38.539
And geniuses often go crazy.

16:39.623 --> 16:42.209
I guess you never have to worry
about going crazy.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.088
Hey. Are you looking down on me?

16:46.171 --> 16:47.047
I'm so full.

16:47.131 --> 16:48.465
Hurry up.

16:48.549 --> 16:50.300
We're late anyway.

16:50.384 --> 16:51.468
Cheong-san, hold on.

16:54.054 --> 16:56.306
Why? We're late. I have a Literature test.

16:56.390 --> 16:58.142
I need to ask you something.

16:58.225 --> 16:59.226
What is it?

16:59.935 --> 17:01.603
-Never mind.
-What?

17:02.396 --> 17:03.897
Forget it. What would you know?

17:04.565 --> 17:05.399
What is it?

17:14.658 --> 17:16.326
Is this better

17:17.453 --> 17:18.370
or is this better?

17:20.289 --> 17:21.123
Look closely.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.625
This? Or this?

17:27.921 --> 17:29.214
This looks better, right?

17:42.811 --> 17:43.937
Get lost.

Hey. We have to finish the vegetables.

19:03.058 --> 19:03.934
Okay?

19:06.687 --> 19:09.815
Hey. You won't get good grades anyway,

19:16.613 --> 19:18.615
I'm not giving up.
I just have no expectations.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.034
That's giving up.

19:22.369 --> 19:23.996
So this is from Cheong-san's place?

19:26.081 --> 19:27.207
Two days ago…

19:30.627 --> 19:33.547
there was an accident by a tollgate,
so I went to the scene,

19:33.630 --> 19:36.091
and whether you're rich or poor,
got good grades or bad,

19:36.592 --> 19:38.385
you're all equal in accidents.

19:38.969 --> 19:40.304
Grades aren't important.

19:41.138 --> 19:43.473
Being safe and healthy is.

19:43.557 --> 19:46.935
I mean it.
I'll make it into tier five this time.

19:47.853 --> 19:48.770
Don't push yourself.

19:50.397 --> 19:52.065
Then I'll make it into tier six.

19:52.149 --> 19:54.526
You shouldn't scam your dad. Here, eat.

19:56.403 --> 19:57.654
It's salty but tasty.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.041
It's Cheong-san.

20:09.124 --> 20:10.250
He's so punctual.

20:10.334 --> 20:11.793
See you later.

20:11.877 --> 20:14.254
Eat another bite. Hey.

20:14.338 --> 20:15.172
Hey, kid!

20:15.255 --> 20:16.340
Are you upset?

20:17.966 --> 20:19.551
That punk. Dang it.

20:22.179 --> 20:25.390
Jeez. She hardly ate.

20:28.018 --> 20:29.686
I should eat her leftovers first.

20:30.729 --> 20:33.607
-Get ready. Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

20:34.191 --> 20:38.445
-Rock, paper, scissors!
-Rock, paper, scissors!

20:41.114 --> 20:42.699
Yes!

20:44.284 --> 20:45.744
I'm seriously going to kill you.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.249
Hey, On-jo!

20:50.332 --> 20:51.250
Nam On-jo!

21:01.885 --> 21:04.137
Play fair, you punk.

21:06.431 --> 21:07.641
Damn, I'm so out of breath.

21:08.141 --> 21:09.226
Carry it.

21:10.978 --> 21:13.981
Look at this.
I got hurt while making breakfast.

21:17.818 --> 21:18.902
Let's go, gopher.

21:27.494 --> 21:28.495
Nam-ra.

21:30.038 --> 21:31.123
Classroom president!

21:34.751 --> 21:35.919
Hurry up!

21:38.005 --> 21:40.424
RESIDENTS ONLY
STUDENTS OF SUBSIDIZED HOUSING STAY AWAY

21:40.507 --> 21:41.550
I'm going first!

21:41.633 --> 21:42.592
Wait for me!

21:43.552 --> 21:44.594
Hey, punk!

21:44.678 --> 21:46.138
-Bye.
-Okay.

21:46.638 --> 21:47.806
Just go! That bastard!

21:47.889 --> 21:50.434
Hey, you punks! Get back here!

21:51.268 --> 21:53.979
You live in the rental apartments, right?

21:54.062 --> 21:55.605
Hey! You punks!

21:57.357 --> 21:58.442
Hey!

21:58.525 --> 21:59.359
Hi.

21:59.901 --> 22:01.486
See you later!

22:02.195 --> 22:03.780
Wait for me! Damn it!

22:03.864 --> 22:06.325
That fucking bum.

22:13.457 --> 22:14.833
Ji-min!

22:14.916 --> 22:16.960
Eat this with your friends during choir.

22:17.044 --> 22:18.378
I said I didn't want it.

22:18.462 --> 22:20.047
Goodness.

22:20.922 --> 22:22.966
She skipped breakfast too.

22:36.480 --> 22:37.773
Seriously?

22:50.202 --> 22:52.954
-Tick-tock. Hurry up.
-Hurry.

22:53.038 --> 22:54.414
-Wake up earlier.
-Get inside.

22:54.498 --> 22:57.793
And that's it. Stop right there! Stop!

22:58.585 --> 23:00.212
-Really?
-Put your names down.

23:00.295 --> 23:01.171
I'm so pissed.

23:01.254 --> 23:02.506
Let's see.

23:02.589 --> 23:04.174
Can you let it slide just once?

23:04.257 --> 23:05.842
Of course not.

23:05.926 --> 23:07.260
-You have been chosen.
-Please.

23:07.344 --> 23:09.262
-Please, sir.
-You get three demerits each.

23:09.346 --> 23:10.639
You three are always late.

23:14.101 --> 23:15.602
Get moving.

23:30.075 --> 23:31.618
Hey.

23:31.701 --> 23:34.496
Is it my fault
that asshole Jin-su went missing?

23:35.455 --> 23:36.373
That's not it.

23:36.456 --> 23:39.000
Then why did you tattle on me?

23:39.084 --> 23:41.753
The teacher said
to write down everything we knew.

23:41.837 --> 23:42.921
And what do you know?

23:44.005 --> 23:45.006
Damn it.

23:45.090 --> 23:47.884
Fuck you, asshole. What do you know?

23:47.968 --> 23:50.470
These assholes are pissing me off.

23:50.554 --> 23:51.888
Hey. Do it.

23:54.015 --> 23:55.559
What are you looking at?

23:57.144 --> 23:58.687
Where are you looking?

24:00.647 --> 24:01.648
Fuck.

24:04.651 --> 24:05.902
It's okay.

24:07.154 --> 24:08.029
Fuck off.

24:09.281 --> 24:10.699
Stay still.

24:11.366 --> 24:13.160
CONSTRUCTION NOTICE

24:13.243 --> 24:17.914
NEW CONSTRUCTION IN PROGRESS
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

24:21.668 --> 24:23.545
You fucking pervert.

24:24.254 --> 24:25.255
You like that?

24:27.591 --> 24:28.800
Hey.

24:30.719 --> 24:32.012
Keep filming.

24:35.682 --> 24:36.683
You asshole.

24:40.353 --> 24:41.480
Film her.

24:42.856 --> 24:44.399
Keep filming, asshole.

24:46.568 --> 24:48.778
-You fucking asshole.
-That's enough.

24:51.448 --> 24:52.407
Let him go.

25:02.584 --> 25:03.627
Fuck. You asshole.

25:08.048 --> 25:10.800
You little dumbass chicken.

25:14.971 --> 25:18.558
You used to party with us.
Don't try to act all holier-than-thou.

25:18.642 --> 25:20.477
Get lost.

25:20.560 --> 25:21.811
Grow up.

25:25.899 --> 25:27.192
You guys, go.

25:30.737 --> 25:31.571
Go ahead.

25:33.990 --> 25:35.325
I dare you.

25:42.916 --> 25:43.833
Move.

25:45.794 --> 25:47.254
Will you live like this forever?

25:50.465 --> 25:51.299
Let's go.

25:53.176 --> 25:55.262
You look really sexy in this.

25:56.179 --> 25:57.681
Should I send it to your mom?

25:59.015 --> 26:01.226
You know I'm friends with her
on Facebook, right?

26:03.103 --> 26:06.356
You crazy asshole. What kind of weirdo
is friends with an old lady?

26:09.484 --> 26:10.318
I can't go.

26:10.819 --> 26:12.988
It's okay. You can.

26:15.323 --> 26:16.491
It's not okay.

26:17.909 --> 26:19.202
If I leave now…

26:21.329 --> 26:22.789
it'll be twice as bad tomorrow.

26:36.052 --> 26:36.886
Take it off.

26:38.388 --> 26:39.598
Should I do it for you?

26:43.143 --> 26:44.894
Hurry up, damn it.

26:54.112 --> 26:54.988
Su-hyeok.

26:55.071 --> 26:56.239
Hey. Morning.

27:09.628 --> 27:12.797
-What?
-Come to the rooftop after lunch.

27:12.881 --> 27:15.925
The rooftop? I don't fight anymore.

27:16.843 --> 27:18.303
Do you think I'd want to fight?

27:18.386 --> 27:19.387
Then why?

27:20.722 --> 27:21.556
See you later.

27:31.191 --> 27:32.067
What was that?

27:33.777 --> 27:35.362
-It's good.
-Are you changing?

27:35.445 --> 27:37.781
-Why are you looking?
-Don't look. Seriously.

27:39.115 --> 27:40.909
-Do you have water?
-Mine's too warm.

27:40.992 --> 27:41.951
Let me have some.

27:42.035 --> 27:43.411
-You heard.
-I can't hear.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.580
-Are you an idiot?
-Do you hear the song?

27:45.664 --> 27:48.041
Hey, this asshole
lost to me big-time yesterday.

27:48.124 --> 27:49.834
-Hey.
-It was because of the keyboard!

27:49.918 --> 27:51.461
-It was the keyboard.
-He sucks.

27:51.544 --> 27:54.214
-But the lady working there seems cute.
-I'm telling you.

27:54.297 --> 27:55.423
I gave you a head start.

27:55.507 --> 27:57.050
-What are you talking about?
-I said I'd beat you, right?

27:57.133 --> 27:57.967
That's not true.

27:58.051 --> 27:59.469
I let you score two goals.

27:59.552 --> 28:01.429
-He went easy on you.
-That's bullshit!

28:02.222 --> 28:03.264
What do I do?

28:03.348 --> 28:05.100
-Don't bullshit me.
-About what?

28:05.934 --> 28:06.893
I don't know.

28:07.894 --> 28:11.189
-What do I do?
-What? Why? What is it?

28:11.272 --> 28:12.482
I don't know.

28:13.441 --> 28:16.236
-I'll tell you later.
-Tell me what?

28:17.696 --> 28:20.073
-What is it?
-The keyboard was crappy.

28:20.156 --> 28:21.241
That's bullshit.

28:22.033 --> 28:22.909
Sleeping again?

28:22.992 --> 28:24.953
-Su-hyeok.
-I smell your feet from here.

28:25.036 --> 28:27.414
I'm sure this guy didn't wear socks.

28:27.497 --> 28:29.749
-Hey.
-It's not okay.

28:29.833 --> 28:31.000
-Take him out.
-Should we?

28:31.084 --> 28:32.293
-Hey.
-Really?

28:32.377 --> 28:34.254
-That's ridiculous.
-Hey, seriously.

28:34.337 --> 28:35.922
What's that called?

28:36.005 --> 28:36.881
Give me a break.

28:36.965 --> 28:38.842
-Let's break his leg.
-Go ahead.

28:38.925 --> 28:40.927
-Hey!
-Then I'll break his fingers--

28:41.010 --> 28:42.679
What the…

28:42.762 --> 28:44.723
Get off of there. You're gross.

28:44.806 --> 28:45.890
Fine. My bad.

28:46.725 --> 28:47.767
What's the big deal?

28:48.560 --> 28:50.729
Stop that! You're dirty.

28:50.812 --> 28:51.896
What the hell?

28:51.980 --> 28:54.315
Let it go. Why are you so grumpy?

28:54.399 --> 28:57.193
What is it?
What did I do that was so wrong?

28:57.277 --> 29:00.697
You punks. Take your seats now. Move it.

29:03.908 --> 29:04.909
Hi.

29:04.993 --> 29:06.453
Hello!

29:06.536 --> 29:07.954
Hi. Good morning.

29:08.872 --> 29:10.582
Hand in your phones.

29:14.294 --> 29:16.004
Anybody in touch with Hyeon-ju?

29:18.047 --> 29:18.882
Nobody?

29:18.965 --> 29:21.676
None of you tried calling her?

29:21.760 --> 29:25.054
We cleaned the science lab
together yesterday,

29:25.138 --> 29:27.140
but I haven't seen her since.

29:28.975 --> 29:30.059
Okay.

29:30.560 --> 29:32.604
If anyone hears from her,

29:32.687 --> 29:34.481
let me know right away, okay?

29:34.564 --> 29:36.483
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

29:38.067 --> 29:41.196
Exams start next week,
so get your acts together.

29:41.279 --> 29:42.447
Hey, your phone.

29:46.701 --> 29:47.702
Hey.

29:48.870 --> 29:49.913
I hear it.

29:49.996 --> 29:53.166
-Why didn't you silence it?
-Hand over your real phones.

29:54.042 --> 29:56.503
-You idiot.
-Dae-su. Seriously?

29:56.586 --> 29:58.171
How stupid is he?

30:00.131 --> 30:01.758
I love getting on his nerves.

30:01.841 --> 30:02.759
Hey.

30:04.302 --> 30:05.970
Seriously, Wu-jin?

30:08.848 --> 30:11.434
-What are you going to do about it?
-On-jo.

30:12.477 --> 30:13.812
This is your phone from last year.

30:16.105 --> 30:17.357
-She's dumber than me.
-Take it.

30:19.526 --> 30:20.652
Take it now.

30:24.113 --> 30:24.989
Hello, Mr. Lee.

30:25.073 --> 30:26.574
-Yes, hello.
-Hi.

30:26.658 --> 30:29.202
You know Kim Hyeon-ju from my class?

30:29.285 --> 30:31.246
She didn't go home last night.

30:31.329 --> 30:35.792
The kids say they haven't seen her
after cleaning the science lab yesterday.

30:36.918 --> 30:38.294
Oh, is that so?

30:38.962 --> 30:40.839
You haven't seen her, have you?

30:43.007 --> 30:43.883
No, I haven't.

30:46.135 --> 30:49.389
You went home
without stopping by the lab, right?

30:49.889 --> 30:51.140
That's what I said.

30:52.141 --> 30:54.269
I see. I'm sorry.

30:55.979 --> 30:58.398
No one has seen her
since she came here, so…

31:03.987 --> 31:05.238
Is someone inside?

31:07.699 --> 31:08.575
Yes.

31:09.826 --> 31:10.952
A lab hamster.

31:12.120 --> 31:15.248
-I see.
-I need to prepare for class now.

31:15.331 --> 31:16.833
Oh, I see.

31:17.500 --> 31:18.376
Okay.

31:24.716 --> 31:27.343
SUPPLY ROOM

31:37.645 --> 31:39.772
A student was bit by a lab hamster.

31:41.316 --> 31:43.443
She has been sedated with benzodiazepine…

31:48.197 --> 31:51.117
It's slowing down the infection,
but only by a few hours at most.

32:25.401 --> 32:26.527
Don't kill me.

32:29.322 --> 32:30.907
Please don't kill me.

32:35.995 --> 32:37.163
Don't kill you?

32:44.587 --> 32:46.339
Don't bother having hope.

32:55.390 --> 32:56.599
A virus

32:57.767 --> 33:02.939
is somewhere between a living organism
and a non-living organism.

33:03.856 --> 33:07.610
Like a living organism,
it adapts to its surroundings and evolves.

33:10.947 --> 33:13.866
Everything that evolves in this manner

33:15.243 --> 33:17.412
should be considered
an independent living organism.

33:18.079 --> 33:19.455
Mr. Lee.

33:19.539 --> 33:22.417
The textbook says a virus is not
an independent living organism.

33:23.001 --> 33:25.628
Whether or not something is
an independent living organism

33:25.712 --> 33:28.381
doesn't depend on its metabolism,
but its will to survive.

33:31.384 --> 33:32.844
If it has such a strong will…

33:35.138 --> 33:37.682
I'M FUCKING SEXY

33:41.561 --> 33:44.731
…the instinct to survive
surpasses intelligence.

33:45.773 --> 33:48.526
The ecosystem is eventually
dominated by that will.

33:49.277 --> 33:52.530
Humanity has never once defeated a virus.

33:56.034 --> 33:58.536
Leucochloridium paradoxum.

33:59.328 --> 34:02.457
This parasite's final target is a bird.

34:05.168 --> 34:08.629
The parasite enters a snail
and infects its tentacles.

34:08.713 --> 34:12.383
It makes the snail go to a high place
and get eaten by a bird.

34:13.092 --> 34:16.721
In other words, the infected snail
commits suicide as the parasite orders.

34:18.931 --> 34:19.932
Tell me.

34:21.017 --> 34:24.937
Is it because the snail
is less intelligent than the parasite?

34:29.108 --> 34:30.109
No.

34:31.903 --> 34:35.448
It's because the parasite's will
to survive was stronger than the snail's.

34:37.283 --> 34:38.326
The teacher's talking.

34:38.409 --> 34:40.661
The evolving and hereditary
will to survive is…

34:40.745 --> 34:41.829
Keep your head up.

34:43.289 --> 34:46.542
…the sole standard by which
independent living organisms are defined.

34:47.752 --> 34:49.337
Then is the textbook wrong?

34:53.633 --> 34:54.592
The textbook?

34:59.055 --> 35:00.348
It's wrong.

35:25.206 --> 35:28.334
Here, "free from" means the lack of.

35:29.627 --> 35:31.212
Who wants to interpret this?

35:34.132 --> 35:35.299
Okay.

35:35.383 --> 35:36.717
Hee-su.

35:36.801 --> 35:38.928
I need to use the bathroom.

35:39.595 --> 35:40.972
Okay, go.

35:43.975 --> 35:47.812
Okay, then.
Who wants to have a crack at it?

35:49.522 --> 35:50.606
Our classroom president?

35:52.567 --> 35:56.154
The truth is, all of us have
some sort of prejudice.

35:56.237 --> 35:59.532
We all have preconceptions
about other people.

35:59.615 --> 36:01.742
Okay. Good.

36:02.326 --> 36:03.536
Next, Bare-su. Stand up.

36:05.288 --> 36:06.122
Hey.

36:06.706 --> 36:08.040
-That moron.
-Yes?

36:08.124 --> 36:09.458
Why are you "Bare-su"?

36:11.002 --> 36:13.421
It's short for Barefoot Su-hyeok. Bare-su.

36:13.504 --> 36:14.755
Okay.

36:14.839 --> 36:16.757
He really hates wearing socks.

36:18.551 --> 36:20.136
So he stinks a lot.

36:22.597 --> 36:24.015
Okay, Bare-su.

36:24.098 --> 36:25.766
What did Nam-ra just say?

36:27.894 --> 36:28.769
Well…

36:28.853 --> 36:31.189
-Well…
-Well…

36:31.272 --> 36:33.774
He doesn't know. He knows nothing.

36:33.858 --> 36:35.443
She was absolutely correct.

36:37.403 --> 36:40.114
So what was
her absolutely correct interpretation?

36:41.449 --> 36:42.783
He knows.

36:42.867 --> 36:43.910
How could he not?

36:43.993 --> 36:45.745
-So…
-You know, right?

36:45.828 --> 36:46.913
Huh?

36:47.830 --> 36:49.665
What the hell? Isn't that Hyeon-ju?

36:49.749 --> 36:50.791
Hyeon-ju.

36:51.751 --> 36:53.544
Hey, Hyeon-ju.

36:53.628 --> 36:54.921
Hyeon-ju!

36:55.004 --> 36:57.840
Hey. What's wrong? Are you okay?

36:57.924 --> 36:59.383
-Hyeon-ju.
-Is that blood?

36:59.467 --> 37:00.843
-She got hurt!
-Ms. Park.

37:00.927 --> 37:02.803
Yes, it's me. Do you recognize me?

37:02.887 --> 37:05.097
He grabbed me…

37:06.265 --> 37:08.976
The science teacher grabbed me
and locked me up.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.020
He locked you up? The science teacher?

37:11.103 --> 37:13.689
Mr. Lee Byeong-chan? Huh?

37:13.773 --> 37:15.441
He tied me up…

37:15.524 --> 37:16.692
I told you, didn't I?

37:16.776 --> 37:18.444
Just shut up, okay?

37:18.527 --> 37:19.820
Let's go to the infirmary.

37:19.904 --> 37:20.738
That's crazy.

37:20.821 --> 37:23.324
-Nam-ra. Have them study.
-Shouldn't we call the police?

37:23.407 --> 37:26.410
-Stay quiet while I go and check.
-She said he tied her up.

37:26.911 --> 37:29.121
Hyeon-ju. Get up.

37:29.205 --> 37:30.039
I'll carry her.

37:30.122 --> 37:31.457
Okay.

37:31.540 --> 37:33.417
-Someone help him.
-I'll help.

37:33.501 --> 37:34.585
-Good.
-Me too.

37:35.336 --> 37:36.754
Go back to your seats!

37:37.588 --> 37:38.547
Now.

37:46.597 --> 37:48.099
-Hyeon-ju.
-What's wrong?

37:48.182 --> 37:49.475
Guys, hold her still.

37:53.604 --> 37:54.605
What's wrong with her?

37:59.485 --> 38:00.903
What's wrong? Do you feel sick?

38:01.404 --> 38:03.739
What do I do?

38:03.823 --> 38:05.408
Does your stomach hurt? Is it bad?

38:05.491 --> 38:06.409
Let me see.

38:07.118 --> 38:08.035
Please help.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.870
Yes, hold on.

38:09.954 --> 38:10.913
Put her on the bed.

38:10.997 --> 38:12.540
Please take a look at her.

38:17.878 --> 38:19.797
Her temperature is way too low.

38:19.880 --> 38:22.550
Hold this down so she doesn't kick it off.

38:23.092 --> 38:24.510
-Hold her.
-Hyeon-ju.

38:24.593 --> 38:26.429
-It's okay.
-Please call an ambulance.

38:26.512 --> 38:28.723
-I'll sedate her and clean her wounds.
-Okay.

38:30.683 --> 38:31.684
Hyeon-ju. It's okay.

38:33.144 --> 38:34.854
Hyeon-ju. You're okay now.

38:42.903 --> 38:43.821
EMERGENCY CALL

39:02.298 --> 39:03.507
-I'm hot.
-Hang in there.

39:03.591 --> 39:05.051
Your temperature is too low.

39:05.134 --> 39:06.719
I'm hot. I'm too hot.

39:06.802 --> 39:09.764
You'll be at the hospital soon.
I'm here, so don't worry.

39:09.847 --> 39:12.558
The science teacher gave me
a strange shot.

39:13.476 --> 39:16.854
A shot?
Mr. Lee Byeong-chan gave you a shot?

39:17.897 --> 39:19.690
He tried to kill me.

39:21.734 --> 39:23.527
Hyeon-ju, what shot?

39:23.611 --> 39:25.946
I'm going to kill them all.

39:26.030 --> 39:27.031
Hyeon-ju.

39:30.618 --> 39:31.535
Are you okay?

39:32.370 --> 39:34.538
-Hold her down so I can give her a shot.
-Okay.

39:36.749 --> 39:40.127
Just a second, okay? Hyeon-ju. Hang on.

39:45.091 --> 39:47.009
It's odd. Hyeon-ju was really odd.

39:47.093 --> 39:49.470
-Totally.
-It's weird to everyone else too, right?

39:49.553 --> 39:51.430
It's strange that she was gone all day,

39:51.514 --> 39:54.266
and she was all bloody
and talking about the science teacher.

39:54.350 --> 39:56.894
Maybe she went somewhere and got hurt,

39:56.977 --> 39:58.479
and then came back here.

39:58.562 --> 40:00.815
-It must be true.
-What? Did you hear something?

40:01.607 --> 40:05.152
You know how they said
that Mr. Lee's son ran away from home?

40:05.986 --> 40:07.613
I heard that wasn't the case.

40:09.115 --> 40:11.033
-He committed suicide.
-Don't be stupid.

40:11.117 --> 40:12.660
-He committed suicide?
-You believe that?

40:12.743 --> 40:16.664
I'm telling you it's true.
Hyeon-ju hung out with them

40:16.747 --> 40:18.374
and bullied him a lot too.

40:18.457 --> 40:19.792
So the science teacher

40:19.875 --> 40:22.878
is going after everyone
who bullied his son one by one.

40:23.754 --> 40:24.588
To kill them.

40:24.672 --> 40:25.756
Who said that?

40:25.840 --> 40:27.758
-All the kids.
-All the kids who?

40:27.842 --> 40:31.095
I did see Hyeon-ju last
in the science lab.

40:31.762 --> 40:32.638
Hey.

40:33.514 --> 40:34.682
I think

40:34.765 --> 40:37.059
maybe Mr. Lee made Hyeon-ju film porn.

40:37.143 --> 40:38.978
-Porn?
-Moron.

40:39.061 --> 40:40.729
Get your mind out of the gutter.

40:40.813 --> 40:42.064
You fat-ass.

40:42.148 --> 40:44.733
-Why are you cursing at me, moron?
-Because you're a pervert, moron.

40:44.817 --> 40:46.527
So why did he kidnap her?

40:46.610 --> 40:48.779
-Have you ever been kidnapped?
-Of course, not. Moron.

40:48.863 --> 40:50.573
That's no way
to talk to your brother-in-law.

40:50.656 --> 40:52.658
I told you to stop saying that.

40:56.537 --> 40:58.164
Hey, what happened?

40:58.789 --> 41:00.916
-What happened?
-How is she?

41:01.000 --> 41:01.917
How's Hyeon-ju?

41:02.585 --> 41:04.253
It's no joke. She was biting people…

41:04.336 --> 41:05.171
Where's On-jo?

41:05.254 --> 41:06.130
She got hurt.

41:06.213 --> 41:08.299
Where? How bad is it?

41:08.382 --> 41:09.508
Just a little bit.

41:09.592 --> 41:11.093
Hyeon-ju bit her?

41:11.177 --> 41:12.470
I think she went crazy.

41:12.553 --> 41:14.763
Her temperature is low,
but she said she was hot.

41:14.847 --> 41:17.183
-She tried to bite us when we covered her.
-What?

41:17.266 --> 41:18.225
Does she have rabies?

41:18.309 --> 41:19.560
Don't be stupid.

41:19.643 --> 41:21.896
But Hyeon-ju had a strange smell.

41:21.979 --> 41:24.023
-What smell?
-The same as the science teacher.

41:24.106 --> 41:25.524
-A rotting corpse.
-Yes, that.

41:25.608 --> 41:28.736
And she said he gave her a strange shot.

41:28.819 --> 41:30.404
What a total psycho.

41:30.488 --> 41:33.032
Shouldn't we report this to the police?

41:33.824 --> 41:36.076
I don't know.
Ms. Park said she'd handle it.

41:37.369 --> 41:38.204
What the…

41:38.287 --> 41:40.498
She's studying right now.

41:40.581 --> 41:42.583
She's number one in our school.

41:43.375 --> 41:44.543
So? Where's On-jo?

41:44.627 --> 41:45.544
In the infirmary.

42:01.644 --> 42:03.812
I think she went into shock
due to hypothermia.

42:03.896 --> 42:04.980
I gave her a sedative.

42:05.064 --> 42:08.192
Okay. We'll take her to Hyosan Hospital.
Did you contact her parents?

42:08.275 --> 42:10.903
Yes. They just left.
Please take good care of her.

42:10.986 --> 42:12.821
-Okay.
-Thank you.

42:15.032 --> 42:15.866
She'll be fine.

42:16.367 --> 42:17.243
Are you okay?

42:17.826 --> 42:19.620
Look at me. Were you startled?

42:19.703 --> 42:20.871
Totally.

42:21.664 --> 42:22.748
My God.

42:23.791 --> 42:25.501
What's wrong with your friend?

42:26.085 --> 42:28.796
I don't know.
I'll tell you later when I get home.

42:29.630 --> 42:32.132
I'm on call,
so I won't be home until morning.

42:33.008 --> 42:36.428
Make sure not to get it wet.
Call me right away if anything happens.

42:36.512 --> 42:38.180
I'll rush right over. Okay?

42:38.264 --> 42:40.766
-Okay.
-All right. Bye.

42:42.059 --> 42:43.519
-Hurry.
-Okay.

42:45.104 --> 42:47.439
Please take good care of her.

42:47.523 --> 42:50.150
-Given the situation, I can't talk long.
-Okay.

42:50.234 --> 42:51.235
-Go.
-You should go.

43:03.247 --> 43:04.790
Thanks for your help, both of you.

43:04.873 --> 43:07.376
I'll head back in soon,

43:09.128 --> 43:12.214
so don't tell anyone about this yet, okay?

43:12.298 --> 43:13.340
-Yes, ma'am.
-Okay.

43:15.175 --> 43:17.136
Please don't tell anyone
for the time being.

43:17.219 --> 43:18.178
Okay.

43:19.972 --> 43:21.890
Go back to the classroom. Let's go.

43:23.225 --> 43:25.603
Are you okay? Were you bit?

43:26.562 --> 43:29.481
-No, it's just a scratch.
-You didn't get hurt anywhere else?

43:32.818 --> 43:35.821
Hey.
Why did you want to see me on the roof?

43:35.904 --> 43:38.449
-What?
-You said to come up after lunch.

43:41.160 --> 43:44.371
Can you just tell me now?
I'm playing basketball after lunch.

43:54.673 --> 43:55.549
What is it?

44:00.095 --> 44:01.764
NAM ON-JO

44:01.847 --> 44:05.726
Hey. This means… you want to go out.

44:07.436 --> 44:08.896
Yes.

44:08.979 --> 44:11.523
-You're going out with Cheong-san.
-No, I'm not.

44:12.024 --> 44:14.360
We've lived next door
ever since we were kids,

44:14.443 --> 44:16.779
so his mom always gives us chicken…

44:16.862 --> 44:18.906
-I do like chicken.
-Okay.

44:18.989 --> 44:20.115
But not him.

44:21.033 --> 44:21.909
I see.

44:22.868 --> 44:24.161
-On-jo!
-But--

44:25.245 --> 44:26.705
I heard you got hurt. Where?

44:27.915 --> 44:29.333
How bad is it?

44:29.416 --> 44:30.918
You're such a klutz.

44:31.001 --> 44:32.086
I'm fine.

44:34.963 --> 44:37.675
Was she hurt badly?
She was careless again, wasn't she?

44:37.758 --> 44:38.842
No.

44:39.468 --> 44:42.763
She got hurt while trying
to avoid getting bitten by Hyeon-ju.

44:42.846 --> 44:43.806
Hey.

44:44.807 --> 44:46.517
You're going out with On-jo, right?

44:48.560 --> 44:49.561
Right?

44:49.645 --> 44:52.022
Yes. That's right.

44:53.899 --> 44:56.485
Did you expect me to say that? You moron.

44:57.027 --> 45:00.614
If the world comes to an end
and only On-jo, me, and a zombie are left,

45:00.698 --> 45:02.491
I'd go out with the zombie.

45:03.575 --> 45:04.451
Why do you ask?

45:05.327 --> 45:07.830
No reason. Let's go.

45:07.913 --> 45:09.331
What's for lunch today?

45:10.124 --> 45:11.291
Tell me why you asked.

45:11.375 --> 45:12.751
I want tonkatsu.

45:17.631 --> 45:19.299
How much longer?

45:19.383 --> 45:20.843
We're almost there.

45:42.364 --> 45:43.532
Hyeon-ju went to the hospital.

45:45.492 --> 45:46.535
-Mr. Lee. Wait.
-Hey.

45:46.618 --> 45:48.579
-We can't send her to a hospital.
-Calm down.

45:48.662 --> 45:51.373
-What are you saying?
-Let go of me!

45:51.457 --> 45:53.292
No! Explain yourself.

45:53.375 --> 45:54.793
We can't send her to a hospital.

45:54.877 --> 45:57.129
We have to put her in quarantine.
Do you hear me?

45:57.963 --> 45:59.047
Sit down.

45:59.131 --> 46:02.426
You already turned things upside down
at the school because of your son.

46:02.509 --> 46:04.762
How could you say that?
Jin-su was the victim!

46:05.721 --> 46:07.431
And you forced us to bury it.

46:08.682 --> 46:10.642
What kind of nonsense is that?

46:10.726 --> 46:14.730
We have the school evaluation
coming up too. You should've called me.

46:14.813 --> 46:17.983
Before calling an ambulance.
What if the police come?

46:18.066 --> 46:19.610
I already called the police.

46:19.693 --> 46:21.737
You should resolve
these matters internally.

46:21.820 --> 46:24.072
I'll call the police if needed,
so tell them not to come.

46:24.156 --> 46:25.699
-But…
-Mr. Lee.

46:26.325 --> 46:27.326
Police.

46:35.751 --> 46:36.752
It's been a while,

46:37.336 --> 46:38.629
Mr. Lee Byeong-chan.

48:09.386 --> 48:10.220
It's so good.

48:10.304 --> 48:12.014
-What?
-Nothing.

48:13.974 --> 48:16.602
Hey. You'll burn a hole
in Cheong-san's face.

48:18.270 --> 48:19.688
I wasn't looking at him.

48:19.771 --> 48:22.608
Yeah, right. The entire school knows
you two are going out.

48:22.691 --> 48:23.650
We're not.

48:25.861 --> 48:26.945
I mean it.

48:30.616 --> 48:31.658
Actually,

48:32.868 --> 48:34.244
you can't tell anyone, okay?

48:34.828 --> 48:35.913
Tell them what?

48:36.997 --> 48:38.040
I actually…

48:40.667 --> 48:41.501
Never mind.

48:42.586 --> 48:43.962
-Hey.
-Stop that.

48:44.046 --> 48:45.130
What is it?

48:45.213 --> 48:46.340
Nothing.

48:48.634 --> 48:49.843
Did you sleep with him?

48:51.053 --> 48:52.846
You did, right? I guessed it, right?

48:52.930 --> 48:54.222
Are you insane?

48:54.306 --> 48:56.141
I told Su-hyeok that I like him.

48:56.224 --> 48:57.434
What?

48:59.144 --> 49:00.771
I told Su-hyeok that I like him.

49:02.105 --> 49:03.273
You crazy--

49:03.357 --> 49:04.191
What?

49:04.274 --> 49:05.901
-What the hell?
-You scared me.

49:05.984 --> 49:07.778
-What?
-What is she, an attention whore?

49:07.861 --> 49:08.862
-Quiet.
-What the hell?

49:08.946 --> 49:10.197
Are you insane?

49:11.114 --> 49:12.908
Cheong-san… Su-hyeok?

49:12.991 --> 49:13.951
Quiet.

49:16.662 --> 49:18.163
-You eat it. It's okay.
-What?

49:18.246 --> 49:20.707
What did you say?
Did you just ask him out?

49:21.416 --> 49:22.793
I gave him my name tag.

49:24.002 --> 49:25.545
So you just threw yourself at him.

49:26.630 --> 49:27.839
So?

49:31.426 --> 49:32.427
That's all.

49:33.053 --> 49:33.929
What?

49:34.930 --> 49:36.306
He didn't give you an answer?

49:37.140 --> 49:38.141
Or give off a vibe?

49:39.434 --> 49:42.229
You couldn't tell how he felt or anything?

49:43.814 --> 49:45.023
This is driving me nuts.

49:46.024 --> 49:47.484
You're driving me nuts.

49:57.411 --> 49:59.413
It's bad for your ears
wearing them too long.

50:02.624 --> 50:04.626
Earphones. They're bad for your ears.

50:05.252 --> 50:06.211
I know.

50:17.681 --> 50:19.808
Do you want
to visit Hyeon-ju after school?

50:20.600 --> 50:23.228
-Why?
-You're classroom president.

50:24.354 --> 50:28.108
My mom made me classroom president
by donating to the school.

50:28.900 --> 50:32.696
That's why no one considers me
the classroom president.

50:33.822 --> 50:35.615
So why must I act like it?

50:38.493 --> 50:40.829
-What?
-I'm just amazed.

50:42.414 --> 50:44.541
I've never heard you talk
this much before.

50:45.792 --> 50:49.755
I thought you were incapable
of saying more than five words.

51:02.809 --> 51:05.645
-I want to cut class.
-I'm so sleepy.

51:06.438 --> 51:07.731
What the hell?

51:07.814 --> 51:09.024
INFIRMARY

51:09.107 --> 51:09.983
Hey.

51:10.067 --> 51:11.026
Come look.

51:11.109 --> 51:12.235
-What is it?
-Look.

51:14.571 --> 51:16.281
What's with the nurse?

51:18.241 --> 51:19.951
She must be fucking drunk.

51:21.495 --> 51:23.497
Did she get fired? What's wrong with her?

51:25.290 --> 51:26.917
What is she doing in bare feet?

51:31.880 --> 51:32.964
What the hell?

51:34.883 --> 51:36.134
Fuck!

51:36.218 --> 51:38.637
-She hit her head really hard.
-Scared the hell out of me.

51:38.720 --> 51:39.971
What's wrong with her?

51:40.806 --> 51:43.391
-What the…
-Shouldn't we call an ambulance?

51:43.475 --> 51:44.726
You're screwed.

51:44.810 --> 51:46.686
What's wrong with her? Hey.

51:47.896 --> 51:49.689
What are you doing, moron?

51:49.773 --> 51:50.690
Help!

51:51.566 --> 51:52.776
What do we do?

51:55.112 --> 51:56.446
Fuck. Are you nuts?

52:06.790 --> 52:08.416
Out of my way!

52:08.500 --> 52:09.626
What the hell?

52:52.419 --> 52:53.503
Fuck!

52:53.587 --> 52:54.713
Stay away!

53:11.188 --> 53:13.565
-Rock, paper, scissors!
-Rock, paper, scissors!

53:13.648 --> 53:14.482
Yes!

53:14.566 --> 53:16.651
-Rock, paper, scissors!
-Rock, paper, scissors!

54:02.030 --> 54:02.989
Eun-ji.

54:07.494 --> 54:08.828
Don't do it.

54:10.497 --> 54:11.790
Want to come up too?

54:12.374 --> 54:13.208
Eun-ji.

54:13.833 --> 54:16.544
Come down. Let's talk from here.

54:16.628 --> 54:17.879
They said

54:19.631 --> 54:20.966
they'll post it online.

54:21.049 --> 54:22.050
No.

54:23.301 --> 54:24.970
They agreed to delete it.

54:25.053 --> 54:26.638
They promised me.

54:26.721 --> 54:27.889
This is hell.

54:29.099 --> 54:31.059
I'm just escaping from hell.

54:31.142 --> 54:32.310
I'll take care of it.

54:32.894 --> 54:33.937
I can do it.

54:34.854 --> 54:36.106
I'll delete everything.

54:37.565 --> 54:38.400
So,

54:38.900 --> 54:39.901
please,

54:40.735 --> 54:43.571
I'm begging you.
Please don't do it, Eun-ji.

54:48.368 --> 54:49.494
Why are you crying?

54:53.081 --> 54:56.668
Do you… like me?

55:10.849 --> 55:13.393
It would be really funny
if two losers liked each other.

55:17.230 --> 55:19.816
If two losers go out,
they become even bigger losers.

55:23.945 --> 55:25.238
So stay away from me.

55:26.448 --> 55:27.365
Eun-ji.

55:27.949 --> 55:28.992
Stay away

55:30.618 --> 55:31.661
from my dead body too.

55:40.795 --> 55:42.339
Eun-ji!

56:21.628 --> 56:22.921
Prez!

56:23.004 --> 56:24.798
Hurry!

56:25.465 --> 56:26.508
Run!

56:35.058 --> 56:36.684
I have a good idea.

56:36.768 --> 56:37.769
Ask Cheong-san.

56:38.520 --> 56:39.854
Forget it.

56:39.938 --> 56:42.649
Su-hyeok and Cheong-san are close.

56:42.732 --> 56:44.984
Ask him how Su-hyeok feels about you.

56:45.777 --> 56:46.611
No.

56:47.737 --> 56:49.864
On-jo. Listen to Mama.

56:50.573 --> 56:53.326
Su-hyeok may have told him already.

56:53.410 --> 56:55.745
Still, I can't tell him.
He'll tease me like crazy.

56:57.372 --> 56:58.665
Put mine away too, gopher.

56:59.165 --> 57:00.375
Hey, Cheong-san.

57:00.458 --> 57:02.168
On-jo needs to talk to you.

57:04.712 --> 57:07.715
Hey. You and Su-hyeok are close, right?

57:07.799 --> 57:09.551
Totally. Why?

57:10.468 --> 57:11.469
See?

57:13.096 --> 57:13.972
What is it?

57:15.140 --> 57:16.349
Nothing. Get lost.

57:17.183 --> 57:19.352
-So, On-jo--
-Hey.

57:19.936 --> 57:21.312
Want to die?

57:21.396 --> 57:22.355
Fine.

57:23.356 --> 57:26.109
Hey. A real friend would help
in situations like this.

57:28.987 --> 57:29.904
What is it?

57:34.659 --> 57:36.995
What's wrong? Did Su-hyeok say something?

57:37.078 --> 57:38.037
No.

57:38.997 --> 57:39.998
Did you two fight?

57:40.665 --> 57:41.624
I said no.

57:42.625 --> 57:45.253
Then what? Did he say he likes you?

57:46.421 --> 57:47.338
Did he say that?

57:48.089 --> 57:49.716
-What?
-Did he say he likes me?

57:50.383 --> 57:51.718
Su-hyeok?

57:53.219 --> 57:55.680
No? He didn't say anything?

57:56.681 --> 57:58.016
What are you talking about?

57:58.808 --> 57:59.893
Earlier…

58:02.270 --> 58:04.606
-You can't tell anyone, okay?
-What?

58:04.689 --> 58:06.024
You really can't tell anyone.

58:06.107 --> 58:07.442
About what?

58:09.277 --> 58:12.780
I told him that I like him,
but I don't know how he feels.

58:12.864 --> 58:14.240
He won't say anything.

58:19.621 --> 58:20.538
Hey.

58:20.622 --> 58:21.873
Yes?

58:21.956 --> 58:25.084
Can you ask him what he thinks about me?

58:26.961 --> 58:28.004
We're not close.

58:29.589 --> 58:30.715
Yes, you are.

58:31.508 --> 58:32.800
No, we're not.

58:35.094 --> 58:36.804
Can't you help me out for once?

58:37.430 --> 58:38.723
You're not a real friend.

59:16.886 --> 59:18.471
Fuck.

59:26.896 --> 59:27.730
Move!
