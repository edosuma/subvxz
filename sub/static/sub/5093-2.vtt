00:18.134 --> 00:20.719
All right, what's going on?
What do you got?

00:20.721 --> 00:22.187
Angela Ferrara.
Called 911,

00:22.189 --> 00:23.326
said she was fighting
with her boyfriend.

00:23.351 --> 00:24.090
Uh-huh.

00:24.091 --> 00:26.274
When we got here,
she changed her story.

00:26.276 --> 00:27.943
Claims she fell down the stairs.
Really?

00:27.945 --> 00:28.927
Where's the boyfriend?

00:28.929 --> 00:29.928
No sign of him.

00:29.930 --> 00:31.730
Great. Angela...

00:31.732 --> 00:34.432
Detective Reagan. This is my
partner, Detective Curatola.

00:34.434 --> 00:36.034
You okay?
Yeah.

00:36.036 --> 00:39.237
I... My freakin' heel got
caught on one of the steps.

00:39.239 --> 00:41.573
- I just fell. It was...
- Right. We got

00:41.575 --> 00:43.458
a 911 call, said something
about your boyfriend.

00:43.460 --> 00:45.660
Oh, no, no.
That was a mistake.

00:45.662 --> 00:48.163
I-I kind of lost it
for a second.

00:48.165 --> 00:50.449
I'm so sorry to bother you guys.

00:50.451 --> 00:52.084
Where's your
boyfriend now?

00:52.086 --> 00:54.252
He took off a little while ago.

00:54.254 --> 00:55.787
He didn't have anything
to do with this.

00:55.789 --> 00:57.756
You understand, Angela,
there's only so much we can do

00:57.758 --> 01:00.142
to help you if you don't tell us
what really happened, all right?

01:00.144 --> 01:03.812
Yeah, no.
Like I said, I fell.

01:03.814 --> 01:06.298
Right.
I'm really sorry to bother you guys.

01:06.300 --> 01:07.516
I'm fine, really.

01:07.518 --> 01:09.351
Yeah, okay. No problem.
Thank you.

01:09.353 --> 01:11.236
We should
get her to the E.R.

01:11.238 --> 01:12.971
Yeah, you do that.
Right.

01:14.490 --> 01:17.142
What is with these girls?
Do they all use "I fell

01:17.144 --> 01:19.027
down the steps" for an excuse?
I don't know.

01:19.029 --> 01:21.980
They keep covering for
these sons of bitches.

01:21.982 --> 01:24.032
This is the next-door neighbor.
Do you have any idea

01:24.034 --> 01:26.451
what happened tonight, ma'am?
Well, Angela's a nice girl,

01:26.453 --> 01:28.587
but her tastin men
is the worst.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.972
Did you see her fight with her boyfriend?
No, I heard.

01:30.974 --> 01:33.825
We share the same bedroom wall.
I could write a book.

01:33.827 --> 01:35.544
Oh?
This is not the first time.

01:35.546 --> 01:36.545
Angela had

01:36.547 --> 01:38.346
a bad breakup

01:38.348 --> 01:39.497
with a Kevin.
Kevin.

01:39.499 --> 01:41.216
Yeah, I think he lives
on the block.

01:41.218 --> 01:44.335
Do you know the last name
on this Kevin guy?

01:44.337 --> 01:45.720
That's him.

01:45.722 --> 01:47.272
That's-that's
the Kevin.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.506
That's the Kevin?
Yeah.

01:48.508 --> 01:49.891
That's him.
Yeah.

01:49.893 --> 01:51.476
Okay.

01:52.361 --> 01:54.156
Kev, I need to ask
a few questions.

01:54.157 --> 01:55.186
I got nothing to say.

01:55.211 --> 01:57.301
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa,
we didn't ask you

01:57.401 --> 01:59.935
any questions yet-- how do you
know you got nothing to say?

01:59.937 --> 02:01.386
What's your full name, Kevin?

02:01.388 --> 02:02.354
Kevin Carr.

02:02.356 --> 02:03.388
Kevin Carr.
Kevin Carr.

02:03.390 --> 02:04.722
Do you know
Angela Ferrara?

02:04.724 --> 02:05.841
Yeah, so what?

02:05.843 --> 02:07.559
So what? So she got
hurt this evening.

02:07.561 --> 02:09.060
Do you know anything about that?
Nope.

02:09.062 --> 02:10.277
I don't date
Angela anymore.

02:10.280 --> 02:11.663
And unless you're
gonna arrest me,

02:11.665 --> 02:14.166
you got no right to keep me here.
Whoa. Kevin knows

02:14.168 --> 02:16.201
his rights.
 Yeah, sounds like you been

02:16.203 --> 02:18.420
in the system before, Kevin.
Maybe we should look you up.

02:18.422 --> 02:20.071
I'm not looking for trouble, all right?
Good.

02:20.073 --> 02:22.090
Then you won't mind coming down,
answering some questions.

02:22.092 --> 02:23.408
Let's go.
Oh, come on.

02:23.410 --> 02:25.076
Come on.

02:26.912 --> 02:29.047
Watch your head.

02:37.690 --> 02:41.526
Excuse me, I'm looking
for a patient, Angela Ferrara.

02:41.528 --> 02:44.062
I need to ask her a few questions.
Sorry, Detective,

02:44.064 --> 02:46.097
your questions are
gonna have to wait.

02:46.099 --> 02:49.100
Oh, well, okay,
then, Nurse.

02:50.069 --> 02:52.287
Can I have a kiss?
I don't know.

02:52.289 --> 02:53.538
Is it an emergency?
It is.

02:53.540 --> 02:54.823
Oh, okay.

02:54.825 --> 02:56.408
The boys with Henry?

02:56.410 --> 02:58.577
Yeah, I'm gonna pick 'em up
on the way home.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.912
You working all night tonight?
Yep.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.113
Covering for a girl.

03:02.115 --> 03:04.282
She's still on vacation
for the next few days.

03:04.284 --> 03:05.500
I see.

03:05.502 --> 03:06.718
Two weeks back,
and you already

03:06.720 --> 03:08.119
got the graveyard shift
in the E.R., huh?

03:08.121 --> 03:10.005
They're just throwing you
right in the deep end.

03:10.007 --> 03:11.806
Yeah, but I can handle it.

03:11.808 --> 03:14.292
Listen, I gotta go.
Yeah,

03:14.294 --> 03:16.094
but I need to speak
to Angela Ferrara.

03:16.096 --> 03:18.480
Can you help me out?
She's sleeping. Can't it wait till tomorrow?

03:18.482 --> 03:19.965
I guess so.
Did you take care of her?

03:19.967 --> 03:21.234
Yeah, she got knocked
around pretty good.

03:21.259 --> 03:22.301
Yeah, she did.

03:22.302 --> 03:24.636
And it wasn't by a flight of stairs.
Yeah. I didn't think so.

03:24.638 --> 03:25.854
Did you get the guy?
No.

03:25.856 --> 03:27.606
Her ex-boyfriend said
he wasn't with her tonight.

03:27.608 --> 03:30.308
Of course he did.
I gotta go. - Yeah.

03:30.310 --> 03:32.360
Oh, wait, can you go
to the market tomorrow?

03:32.362 --> 03:34.663
I got to go get a bunch
of stuff that we need.

03:34.665 --> 03:36.164
Yeah, I got it.
Don't worry about it.

03:36.166 --> 03:37.749
But use the coupons this time.
I got it.

03:37.751 --> 03:40.585
I'll use the coupons.
Okay. Bye.

03:42.088 --> 03:44.339
This just keeps getting
better and better.

03:53.266 --> 03:54.716
Gentlemen.

03:54.718 --> 03:55.884
Sir.

03:57.836 --> 03:59.271
How much longer?

03:59.273 --> 04:01.139
We've only been
here 20 minutes.

04:01.141 --> 04:02.724
Twenty-three.

04:02.726 --> 04:04.059
Commissioner.

04:04.061 --> 04:06.528
Hey! Good to see you, Sam.

04:06.530 --> 04:07.862
It's the mayor's
pet charity.

04:07.864 --> 04:09.864
Yet somehow I do not
see the mayor.

04:09.866 --> 04:12.534
Lovely to see you, Frank.

04:12.536 --> 04:14.069
You're looking
lovely, Maryanne.

04:14.071 --> 04:17.021
Soon as he shows, we can go.
Good.

04:17.023 --> 04:18.456
Cheer up, Frank.

04:18.458 --> 04:20.408
At least there's an open bar.

04:20.410 --> 04:23.545
Finally, someone I wouldn't mind
having a drink with.

04:23.547 --> 04:24.663
Hey!

04:25.247 --> 04:26.531
Aw.
You do this

04:26.533 --> 04:28.049
all the time.
What's your secret

04:28.051 --> 04:30.135
to surviving these things, Tony?
You just got

04:30.137 --> 04:32.537
to look at it
as part of the workday,

04:32.539 --> 04:35.473
the fun part with free booze
and food. Hiya, Garrett.

04:35.475 --> 04:36.641
Evening, Councilman.

04:36.643 --> 04:38.143
I hear Jimmy
Manning's retiring.

04:38.145 --> 04:41.513
Yeah, they're throwing quite a racket
for him uptown, I hear.

04:41.515 --> 04:43.481
Should get pretty wild.
You want to go?

04:43.483 --> 04:45.767
Well, being commissioner
kind of makes me

04:45.769 --> 04:48.103
a wet blanket at those things.
Miss 'em, though.

04:48.105 --> 04:50.855
Back in the old days, you were
always the last guy standing.

04:50.857 --> 04:52.240
You were always
the first one to leave,

04:52.242 --> 04:54.392
usually with the girl who
popped out of the cake.

04:54.394 --> 04:56.027
The mayor's new budget, Tony.
Mm.

04:56.029 --> 04:59.063
He's cutting my funding
for stress training.

04:59.065 --> 05:00.231
I saw that.
I put that

05:00.233 --> 05:02.951
program in place
when I came on as PC.

05:02.953 --> 05:04.002
It was part of the deal.

05:04.004 --> 05:06.121
Different times,
different mayor.

05:06.123 --> 05:08.906
This administration's all about austerity.
It's gonna be about

05:08.908 --> 05:11.710
damage control if the city isn't safe.
I get it.

05:11.712 --> 05:14.546
I used to carry a gold shield
myself, remember?

05:14.548 --> 05:16.381
Well, have it in your pocket
when the vote comes up.

05:16.383 --> 05:19.517
It's gonna come down
to three undecideds.

05:19.519 --> 05:21.102
Garcia, Vogel...

05:21.104 --> 05:23.805
and Tong--
we need all three.

05:23.807 --> 05:26.224
Well, Garcia's pro-cop.
So is Tong.

05:26.226 --> 05:28.109
Yeah, but the
mayor's people

05:28.111 --> 05:31.029
are working these guys hard, and
it's an election year for them.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.114
We need this one, Tony.

05:41.824 --> 05:43.408
Thanks for coming
back in, Kevin.

05:43.410 --> 05:46.294
Listen, I told you everything last night.
I got nothing more to say.

05:46.296 --> 05:48.963
Right, well, we heard that you
and Angela fought all the time.

05:48.965 --> 05:51.115
- Whatever. That bitch is crazy.
- Hey,

05:51.117 --> 05:52.217
watch your mouth.

05:52.219 --> 05:54.636
I ain't seen Angela in weeks.

05:54.638 --> 05:57.288
She told me she met
some big shot.

05:57.290 --> 05:58.690
I feel bad for him.

05:58.692 --> 05:59.641
Yeah, why's that?

05:59.643 --> 06:02.126
Angela likes to party.

06:02.128 --> 06:04.562
She's got a real mouth on her
and a serious temper.

06:04.564 --> 06:06.481
That why you
beat her up last night?

06:06.483 --> 06:08.483
For the hundredth time,
I wasn't with Angela last night.

06:08.485 --> 06:10.101
I saw the ambulance,
I checked it out--

06:10.103 --> 06:11.736
that ain't a crime.
You ought to know

06:11.738 --> 06:13.605
about crime, right, Kevin?
I mean, you got collars

06:13.607 --> 06:16.107
for breaking and entering,
assault, resisting arrest.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.609
Yeah.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.415
And that doesn't mean
I slapped her around last night.

06:19.440 --> 06:19.995
Come on.

06:19.996 --> 06:21.813
We recorded your voice
in the car last night.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.998
Intel's gonna match it
to the voice on the 911 tape,

06:24.000 --> 06:26.251
so why don't you do us all
a favor, stop wasting time

06:26.253 --> 06:27.702
and just give it up, all right?

06:27.704 --> 06:30.538
If Angela I.D.'d me for this,
I'd be in a cell right now.

06:30.540 --> 06:32.173
You got nothing and you know it.

06:32.958 --> 06:35.343
We'll see about that.

06:36.879 --> 06:38.263
Is that how you
do it, tough guy?

06:38.265 --> 06:40.164
You scare them so bad
they're afraid to complain?

06:40.166 --> 06:41.182
Is that it?

06:41.184 --> 06:42.717
Some girls ask for it, you know?

06:42.719 --> 06:45.270
Really?
Yeah, some even like it.

06:45.272 --> 06:47.806
What about you, Detective--
you like it?

06:50.342 --> 06:52.811
You like that, Kevin?!
Get her off me!

06:52.813 --> 06:55.396
Huh? You like that? Seems like you do!
Come on! Come on!

06:55.398 --> 06:56.865
What?!

06:56.867 --> 06:58.149
Come on.

06:58.151 --> 07:01.286
Not so fun
when they fight back, huh?

07:34.092 --> 07:36.943
You ain't got
to explain to me.

07:36.945 --> 07:39.045
What was funny?

07:39.047 --> 07:41.031
Nothing. I mean,
other than the fact

07:41.033 --> 07:42.449
that I think maybe you've

07:42.451 --> 07:43.984
been working with me
a little bit too long.

07:45.287 --> 07:47.487
Piece of trash is not
speaking to me that way.

07:47.489 --> 07:50.773
Yeah, well, I wouldn't worry about
that piece of trash whining to CCRB

07:50.775 --> 07:52.659
about getting tuned up
by a girl.

07:52.661 --> 07:55.395
Detective Reagan.

07:56.280 --> 07:58.915
Yeah, all right.

07:58.917 --> 08:01.218
Thank you.

08:01.220 --> 08:02.919
Reagan, I'm sorry,

08:02.921 --> 08:04.954
but we cannot let him
walk out of here.

08:04.956 --> 08:06.623
I don't think we
have any choice, Jack.

08:06.625 --> 08:07.807
That was the Intel Division.

08:07.809 --> 08:10.227
Turns out it wasn't his voice
on the 911 tape.

08:10.229 --> 08:11.695
What?
Yeah.

08:11.697 --> 08:12.896
You tuned up the wrong guy.

08:15.434 --> 08:17.800
Do I have to apologize?

08:17.802 --> 08:20.854
Course not.
I'll cut him loose.

08:27.495 --> 08:29.329
The shooting range is
like a classroom.

08:29.331 --> 08:31.031
You put your gun on a bench,

08:31.033 --> 08:34.200
a bell goes off, and you
shoot holes in paper targets.

08:34.202 --> 08:37.287
Our people will not have
the split-second decision-making

08:37.289 --> 08:39.706
they need
without stress training.

08:39.707 --> 08:41.124
Saves lives.

08:41.126 --> 08:45.128
The public's and, just as
importantly, my officers'.

08:45.130 --> 08:47.847
Otherwise we might as well be
handing out driver's licenses

08:47.849 --> 08:51.334
without a road test,
and I will not do it.

08:51.336 --> 08:53.019
I will not cut it.

08:57.007 --> 09:00.126
Hold that thought.

09:00.128 --> 09:01.645
Forgotten but not gone.

09:01.647 --> 09:02.812
You heard from the mayor?

09:02.814 --> 09:04.481
He didn't show up
at the party,

09:04.483 --> 09:06.116
'cause he took his wife
to Jamaica.

09:06.118 --> 09:08.585
Gets back the day
<i>after</i> the council vote.

09:08.587 --> 09:11.204
I'm starting to feel
like he's avoiding me.

09:11.206 --> 09:13.073
Yeah, don't fight
that feeling.

09:13.075 --> 09:14.524
Of course he is.

09:14.526 --> 09:15.825
Been making some calls.

09:15.827 --> 09:18.828
There may be a way we can
get the vote we need.

09:18.830 --> 09:20.697
When you say "we,"
it's always me.

09:20.699 --> 09:21.965
My pal at Vogel's office

09:21.967 --> 09:24.451
says he can get the
boss to vote with us.

09:24.453 --> 09:25.585
Now it's "us."

09:25.587 --> 09:27.704
In exchange for...?
Show up

09:27.706 --> 09:29.055
at a fund-raiser down the road,

09:29.057 --> 09:31.141
shake some hands,
take a few pictures,

09:31.143 --> 09:33.877
give 'em the Good Peacekeeping
Seal of Approval.

09:33.879 --> 09:35.845
We might be able to get
the same deal from Tong.

09:35.847 --> 09:37.931
We get those two,
we're one vote away.

09:37.933 --> 09:39.399
Pretty quick with the math.

09:39.401 --> 09:42.102
The Commissioner's
Office is nonpartisan.

09:42.104 --> 09:44.154
This commissioner
needs the votes,

09:44.156 --> 09:47.407
and it's just a couple of
meet and greets. Come on, Frank.

09:47.409 --> 09:48.491
Pass.

09:48.493 --> 09:50.610
Can't we talk about this?
We just did.

09:50.612 --> 09:53.496
Tony Mancini's never
let us down.

10:01.288 --> 10:02.872
Hey.

10:03.674 --> 10:05.542
You here to pick up
the babysitter?

10:05.544 --> 10:07.177
Yeah, well, my trial
got out early,

10:07.179 --> 10:09.212
so we're gonna go
shoe shopping.

10:09.214 --> 10:10.913
Shoe shopping.

10:10.915 --> 10:13.400
Does Barneys sell nurse shoes?

10:14.185 --> 10:15.852
I'll check.

10:15.854 --> 10:17.137
Great.

10:17.139 --> 10:19.222
I'm a size eight.

10:19.224 --> 10:21.257
How is being back at work?

10:21.259 --> 10:22.559
It's good.

10:22.561 --> 10:24.144
It's a little overwhelming.
Yeah,

10:24.146 --> 10:25.895
I remember when I went back,
I kept thinking,

10:25.897 --> 10:28.565
"Why is everyone
wound so tight?"

10:28.567 --> 10:29.699
Yeah.

10:29.701 --> 10:31.785
Pressure, stress, it's...
Yeah.

10:31.787 --> 10:33.770
But you need it; it fuels you.

10:33.772 --> 10:36.606
Yeah. I think I'm still
a little out of shape.

10:36.608 --> 10:37.957
Well, give it some time.

10:37.959 --> 10:39.709
Before you know it,
you're gonna be

10:39.711 --> 10:42.212
snapping at the husband
and screaming at the kids and...

10:42.214 --> 10:43.880
Oh, I never gave that up.

10:43.882 --> 10:46.766
Erin, I got to ask you. Y...

10:48.419 --> 10:49.669
When you went back to work,

10:49.671 --> 10:51.321
did you ever have
any second thoughts?

10:51.323 --> 10:52.305
Are you kidding me?

10:52.307 --> 10:53.973
I was the queen
of the nanny-cam.

10:53.975 --> 10:56.092
I used to bring that
stupid thing into court.

10:56.094 --> 10:57.644
Wow.

10:57.646 --> 11:00.797
I'm sure the judges loved that.
Uh-huh.

11:02.016 --> 11:04.150
But did you feel like,
I don't know...

11:04.152 --> 11:06.236
you were missing stuff?

11:06.238 --> 11:08.855
Of course, but, you know,

11:08.857 --> 11:11.991
Nicky became more independent
and sure of herself.

11:11.993 --> 11:13.693
The boys need
to learn that, too.

11:13.695 --> 11:15.745
Oh, yeah.

11:15.747 --> 11:17.197
And John?

11:17.199 --> 11:22.035
And my ex-husband became
more independent as well.

11:22.037 --> 11:25.822
But, I mean, did he say
he was okay with it, you know?

11:25.824 --> 11:27.040
You going back to work?

11:27.042 --> 11:30.260
Yes, he said he was.

11:33.181 --> 11:34.881
Ok, I got a car full
of groceries

11:34.883 --> 11:36.850
and I used all the coupons
you gave me.

11:36.852 --> 11:38.268
Except, of course,
the coupons for the beer

11:38.270 --> 11:39.519
because they don't make
coupons for beer.

11:39.521 --> 11:41.721
Hello, sis.
Hi.

11:41.723 --> 11:43.640
Oh, and the rain-scented
detergent you wanted,

11:43.642 --> 11:46.176
they didn't have rain-scented,
so I got you bacon-scented.

11:46.178 --> 11:47.977
That's the one
I like.

11:47.979 --> 11:50.113
See your ten grand,
raise you $10,000.

11:56.754 --> 11:59.456
All right, let me know what you
come up with, all right?

11:59.458 --> 12:00.707
Thank you. Detective Reagan.

12:00.709 --> 12:03.409
You know what? Let me get right
back to you, all right?

12:03.411 --> 12:04.461
Thank you.

12:04.463 --> 12:06.579
Any luck with Angela?

12:06.581 --> 12:08.715
No. Oprah couldn't get
that girl to open up.

12:08.717 --> 12:10.032
What about you?

12:10.034 --> 12:12.135
Well, I spoke to the super
of Angela's building

12:12.137 --> 12:13.553
who said there happened
to be a limo parked outside

12:13.555 --> 12:16.089
last night right around
the time of the 911 call.

12:16.091 --> 12:18.174
Well, Carr did say she was
dating a big shot.

12:18.176 --> 12:19.976
Yeah. If Kevin Carr is capable
of telling the truth,

12:19.978 --> 12:21.094
this limo could be our guy.

12:21.096 --> 12:22.178
What about the super?

12:22.180 --> 12:24.213
Did he happen to see anyone
in the car?

12:24.215 --> 12:25.398
No, no.

12:25.400 --> 12:26.599
But I called every
limo company in the area,

12:26.601 --> 12:27.684
they're checking their logs.

12:27.686 --> 12:28.718
We'll see
what they come up with.

12:28.720 --> 12:30.270
Detective Reagan.

12:30.272 --> 12:31.554
Really?

12:31.556 --> 12:34.524
All right, give me
an address.

12:36.076 --> 12:37.894
Great, thank you.

12:37.896 --> 12:40.747
Okay, Queensboro Limo ran a
round-trip between Forest Hills

12:40.749 --> 12:42.081
and Angela's apartment
last night.

12:42.083 --> 12:44.000
No one in that neighborhood
takes a limo

12:44.002 --> 12:45.418
unless they're en route
to the airport.

12:45.420 --> 12:47.036
It's gotta be our guy.

12:47.038 --> 12:49.873
Well, let's see.

12:51.525 --> 12:55.812
Okay. We got a problem.

13:03.637 --> 13:06.022
Excuse me.
I'm Detective Reagan.

13:06.024 --> 13:07.190
This is Detective Curatola.

13:07.192 --> 13:08.775
We need to speak
to your boss.

13:08.777 --> 13:09.676
What is this regarding?

13:09.678 --> 13:11.327
We just have
a few questions.

13:13.614 --> 13:15.899
I have two detectives
out here to see you.

13:15.901 --> 13:18.184
He'll be right out.

13:18.186 --> 13:19.702
Thank you.

13:23.707 --> 13:24.908
Hiya, Danny.

13:26.193 --> 13:28.111
Hope I didn't keep you
waiting long.

13:28.113 --> 13:30.663
No, not at all. This is my
partner, Jackie Curatola.

13:30.665 --> 13:32.549
Good to meet you, Detective.
Councilman.

13:32.551 --> 13:36.302
Detectives Reagan,
Curatola.

13:36.304 --> 13:38.388
Commissioner.

13:38.390 --> 13:41.057
So, what can I do
for you guys?

13:41.059 --> 13:42.392
We just have
a few questions,

13:42.394 --> 13:44.010
but if we're interrupting
something...

13:44.012 --> 13:45.461
Police business
comes first.

13:45.463 --> 13:47.864
I'll wait outside, Tony.
Okay.

13:47.866 --> 13:50.733
Please, follow me.

13:59.057 --> 14:01.593
Come on in. Have a seat.
Thanks, Tony.

14:01.735 --> 14:04.569
Sorry to break up your day.
We just got a few questions.

14:04.656 --> 14:06.472
We have a little situation.

14:06.674 --> 14:10.126
Angela Ferrara, right?
Yeah.

14:10.128 --> 14:11.694
Yeah. Were you with
her last night?

14:11.696 --> 14:13.512
Yes.
You know she called 911?

14:13.514 --> 14:16.482
You know, I'm terribly
embarrassed about this.

14:16.484 --> 14:17.817
It's a big misunderstanding.

14:17.819 --> 14:19.419
How long you been seeing her?

14:19.421 --> 14:20.453
Look, we're not trying

14:20.455 --> 14:21.854
to get into your
personal business here.

14:21.856 --> 14:24.374
We're just trying to get
to the bottom of what happened.

14:24.376 --> 14:25.558
I totally
understand.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.794
We're seeing each other
a couple of months.

14:27.796 --> 14:30.029
Angie's a great girl.

14:30.031 --> 14:31.464
We he a good thing,

14:31.466 --> 14:34.417
but sometimes she
gets a little... dramatic.

14:34.419 --> 14:38.370
She sounded very dramatic
on the 911 tape.

14:38.372 --> 14:40.390
Is that your voice in
the background?

14:40.392 --> 14:46.229
Yeah. I told her calling the
cops isn't a game.

14:46.231 --> 14:47.880
Angie and I had
a couple drinks,

14:47.882 --> 14:50.900
and she started in on how
she was tired

14:50.902 --> 14:52.802
of keeping things on
the down-low.

14:52.804 --> 14:54.087
You married?

14:54.089 --> 14:56.105
No, no, but I am
a city councilman.

14:56.107 --> 14:58.775
Much younger woman,
former dancer,

14:58.777 --> 15:01.894
it kinda writes itself
on Page Six of the <i>Post,</i>

15:01.896 --> 15:04.147
you know what I mean?

15:04.149 --> 15:05.231
Yeah. Go on.

15:05.233 --> 15:07.250
It was a silly little thing,
you know?

15:07.252 --> 15:08.751
We started going back and forth,

15:08.753 --> 15:13.456
and Angela gets loud,
throws an ashtray at me.

15:13.458 --> 15:16.742
The next thing I know,
she's calling 911.

15:16.744 --> 15:18.461
You hit her?

15:18.463 --> 15:20.746
No. No, no, no, no, no.
She grabbed her keys.

15:20.748 --> 15:23.299
I didn't want her to drive
drunk. She's got a history.

15:23.301 --> 15:25.301
So I followed her
down the hall,

15:25.303 --> 15:28.420
and I tried to get the keys
away from her,

15:28.422 --> 15:31.257
and she tripped and took
a header down the stairs.

15:31.259 --> 15:33.359
Mm. So it was an accident.

15:33.361 --> 15:35.278
Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

15:38.982 --> 15:41.984
You being a former cop,
you didn't think to wait around

15:41.986 --> 15:44.954
at all, Tony,
for the cops to show up

15:44.956 --> 15:46.823
or maybe drive her
to the hospital yourself?

15:46.825 --> 15:48.157
Believe me, I tried.

15:48.159 --> 15:50.460
She was going nuts.
She wouldn't let me near her.

15:50.462 --> 15:54.113
I had a car waiting for me
outside, so I just took off.

15:54.115 --> 15:56.215
I just didn't want to have
any more trouble.

15:56.217 --> 15:58.668
And you wanted to keep things
on the down-low.

15:58.670 --> 16:01.787
Look, I probably should've
stuck around,

16:01.789 --> 16:04.006
but Angie was okay,

16:04.008 --> 16:06.926
and this whole thing has been
a big misunderstanding.

16:06.928 --> 16:08.060
She told you that, right?

16:08.062 --> 16:10.379
Yeah, that's what she said.

16:10.381 --> 16:12.014
Angela's a great girl.

16:12.016 --> 16:15.668
I'm just glad she's okay.

16:17.020 --> 16:20.022
All right, well,
I guess we got what we need.

16:20.024 --> 16:20.973
Send my best to Linda.

16:20.975 --> 16:23.025
I'll do that.

16:28.415 --> 16:30.950
I suppose you want
to know what this is about.

16:30.952 --> 16:32.952
Should I?

16:32.954 --> 16:33.953
Probably so.

16:33.955 --> 16:35.487
Councilman Mancini was on
a 911 tape

16:35.489 --> 16:37.423
of a young girl calling
for help last night.

16:37.425 --> 16:38.508
On the tape how?

16:38.510 --> 16:40.326
His voice was heard in
the background.

16:40.328 --> 16:41.511
He was at the scene.

16:41.513 --> 16:42.862
Was the young woman hurt?

16:42.864 --> 16:45.681
Cuts, bruises,
and a broken wrist.

16:45.683 --> 16:49.135
And she's accusing
the councilman?

16:49.137 --> 16:51.187
No, she's accusing
a flight of stairs.

16:55.242 --> 16:56.726
But you think different.

16:56.728 --> 16:58.027
Well, Linda treated her
at the ER,

16:58.029 --> 16:59.445
and it doesn't look
like an accident.

16:59.447 --> 17:02.315
No complaint was filed.
No.

17:02.317 --> 17:03.849
They're both saying
it was an accident.

17:03.851 --> 17:05.818
Someone beat up this girl, sir,

17:05.819 --> 17:08.020
and Mancini was in the apartment
when it happened.

17:08.021 --> 17:12.909
We're talking about
a sitting city councilman here.

17:12.911 --> 17:15.711
We're also talking about a good
friend and ally of yours.

17:15.713 --> 17:18.714
Which is beside this or
any other point, as you know.

17:18.715 --> 17:20.199
You suggesting we back off?

17:20.201 --> 17:24.337
I'm suggesting to both of you
that you make sure you have

17:24.339 --> 17:26.638
a solid case before
you go barreling down

17:26.641 --> 17:28.089
a particular path.

17:28.092 --> 17:29.575
Do you job,

17:29.577 --> 17:31.010
no more, no less.

17:37.317 --> 17:38.734
Sorry, but I
still think

17:38.736 --> 17:40.236
Mancini's lying
through his teeth.

17:40.238 --> 17:42.572
Maybe so, but Angela Ferrara
corroborates his story.

17:42.574 --> 17:44.874
and he's a a hero cop
with a spotless record, so...

17:44.876 --> 17:46.275
What does that mean,
he's innocent?

17:46.277 --> 17:48.194
Did I say that?

17:48.196 --> 17:51.287
You're making this case
very personal, Jack.

17:51.312 --> 17:51.946
What?

17:51.947 --> 17:54.514
Yeah. Hey, it's like
you're on a mission

17:54.516 --> 17:56.667
that's part the case
and part something else.

17:56.669 --> 17:59.185
You work as hard
as any partner I've ever had,

17:59.187 --> 18:00.487
but it's not exactly
your style

18:00.489 --> 18:02.706
to go around beating guys up in
the interrogation room.

18:02.708 --> 18:04.074
No, it's yours.
Ah, funny.

18:04.076 --> 18:05.242
Okay, you know what?

18:05.244 --> 18:08.145
My dad used to take
a belt to my mom.

18:08.147 --> 18:10.747
That is not the reason why
I'm going after this case.

18:10.749 --> 18:11.915
It is my job.

18:11.917 --> 18:14.301
Then let's just stick
to that, all right?

18:14.303 --> 18:16.870
If Mancini's our guy,
I promise you,

18:16.872 --> 18:18.755
we will nail
the son of a bitch.

18:19.557 --> 18:21.058
Okay.

18:27.382 --> 18:30.434
Oh, sorry.
There you go.

18:30.436 --> 18:31.768
Oh...
Oh, look at that.

18:31.770 --> 18:35.272
That is looking so much better.

18:36.441 --> 18:37.941
Think it'll scar?

18:37.943 --> 18:39.276
You know what?

18:39.278 --> 18:40.911
Keep those
Steri-Strips dry.

18:40.913 --> 18:43.497
That's the important thing.
And that should heal nicely.

18:43.499 --> 18:47.400
Oh, and, uh, probably
should take it easy on the stairs.

18:47.402 --> 18:49.419
Yeah.

18:49.421 --> 18:51.071
I was pretty pissed off.

18:51.073 --> 18:52.039
Wasn't paying much attention.

18:52.041 --> 18:53.573
Yeah.

18:53.575 --> 18:56.126
So is your boyfriend
coming to see you?

18:56.128 --> 18:58.578
Not holding
my breath on that.

18:58.580 --> 19:00.047
He's got a big job.

19:00.049 --> 19:01.748
He comes around when he can.

19:01.750 --> 19:04.217
Wow. That must mean

19:04.219 --> 19:06.887
you get to go
to a lot of fancy places, huh?

19:06.889 --> 19:09.356
I wish.

19:09.358 --> 19:11.358
Tony likes to keep me
under wraps.

19:11.360 --> 19:14.361
Yeah, well, as long as he's nice to you.
Right.

19:14.363 --> 19:17.281
Guys are guys.

19:17.283 --> 19:19.783
I been with a lot
worse than him.

19:19.785 --> 19:23.287
I always come out okay, though.

19:23.289 --> 19:25.739
You know, there's guys
and the there's guys.

19:25.741 --> 19:29.209
And some of those guys,

19:29.211 --> 19:32.245
you let 'em get away
with the rough stuff,

19:32.247 --> 19:36.783
he can twist that around into
thinking it's okay with you.

19:36.785 --> 19:38.719
And that can be
pretty dangerous.

19:40.138 --> 19:41.805
You got to protect yourself.

19:41.807 --> 19:43.724
Yeah.

19:43.726 --> 19:45.258
We almost done?

19:45.260 --> 19:46.977
Yeah.

19:46.979 --> 19:48.261
Just about.

19:51.849 --> 19:57.104
The thing is, Angela,
you seem like such a sweet girl.

19:59.140 --> 20:03.443
I don't want to see you
in here again, all busted up.

20:03.445 --> 20:04.978
Or worse.

20:07.648 --> 20:10.834
Appreciate you sticking around
to see us, Lieutenant.

20:10.836 --> 20:13.086
No problem. What brings
you guys uptown?

20:13.088 --> 20:16.456
Tony Mancini, he was here when
you took over the squad?

20:16.458 --> 20:19.509
Yeah. I was his C.O.
for six years.

20:19.511 --> 20:22.663
Yeah, hell of a detective, huh?
The best.

20:22.665 --> 20:23.630
Well, we're looking into

20:23.632 --> 20:24.664
a suspected
domestic violence case.

20:24.666 --> 20:25.716
Mancini's
girlfriend wound up

20:25.718 --> 20:26.833
in the ER.

20:26.835 --> 20:29.086
You say "suspected."

20:29.088 --> 20:30.137
Mm-hmm.

20:30.139 --> 20:31.855
Does this girl say
that Tony beat her?

20:31.857 --> 20:33.673
No. Actually, she said
it was an accident.

20:33.675 --> 20:35.508
And you two have
nothing better to do

20:35.510 --> 20:37.411
than try to jam up
a decorated cop?

20:38.512 --> 20:41.198
We're just trying to find out
what went down here.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.616
Does your old man know
that you're down here

20:42.618 --> 20:43.683
asking questions
about Tony Mancini?

20:43.685 --> 20:45.986
My old man has nothing
to do with this.

20:45.988 --> 20:48.555
But I can assure you
that the Police Commissioner

20:48.557 --> 20:50.540
would like us to find out
what happened.

20:50.542 --> 20:52.909
So I'll ask you: did Tony
Mancini ever raise his hand

20:52.911 --> 20:54.194
to a woman under your watch?

20:54.196 --> 20:57.531
No. You ask anyone in
this squad,

20:57.533 --> 20:59.916
you'll get
the same answer.

20:59.918 --> 21:01.585
Oh.

21:01.587 --> 21:03.086
Are we done?

21:03.088 --> 21:03.920
Sure, we're done.

21:03.922 --> 21:05.722
Appreciate your help.

21:05.724 --> 21:08.341
You like jamming up cops
so much, Reagan,

21:08.343 --> 21:10.894
why don't you
transfer to I.A.?

21:10.896 --> 21:13.346
They're always looking
for a few good rats.

21:14.315 --> 21:16.983
You have a bad day.

21:16.985 --> 21:19.019
What the hell
was that about?

21:19.021 --> 21:20.570
I'll tell you what it was.

21:20.572 --> 21:22.388
He's stonewalling
'cause he knows something.

21:22.390 --> 21:23.824
Maybe he's protecting
one of his own,

21:23.826 --> 21:25.692
but he's paid to protect
people like Angela Ferrara.

21:25.694 --> 21:28.278
Yeah, well, I know
I've been pushing this thing,

21:28.280 --> 21:30.697
I think it's time we back off.

21:30.699 --> 21:31.665
What?

21:31.667 --> 21:33.250
What are you talking about?

21:33.252 --> 21:35.168
First of all, we got nothing
on Mancini.

21:35.170 --> 21:36.670
The victim doesn't want
to say anything.

21:36.672 --> 21:37.704
What do we do?

21:37.706 --> 21:39.423
Hold on.
Let me get this straight.

21:39.425 --> 21:42.125
You suddenly want to back away
from this thing?

21:42.127 --> 21:43.409
We got nothing, Danny.
Nothing.

21:43.411 --> 21:45.712
And things are starting to get
a little crazy here.

21:45.714 --> 21:47.764
And people are starting
to get pissed at us now.

21:47.766 --> 21:50.083
People get pissed off, Jack,
when they have something to hide.

21:50.085 --> 21:51.802
Okay, maybe I wasn't
so sure before, but I am now.

21:51.804 --> 21:53.103
You were right.

21:53.105 --> 21:54.888
Mancini's got something to hide,

21:54.890 --> 21:57.858
Perez is covering for him.

21:57.860 --> 21:59.359
Reagan.

22:00.061 --> 22:02.562
We're on our way.

22:02.564 --> 22:05.765
Domestic disturbance at
Angela Ferrara's apartment.

22:11.989 --> 22:15.325
What's going on,
Mrs. Goldfarb?

22:15.327 --> 22:17.210
It's really bad this time.

22:17.212 --> 22:19.379
I heard things breaking.
Okay.

22:19.381 --> 22:21.915
I'm afraid she's
gonna get killed.

22:21.917 --> 22:23.667
Police. Open up.

22:25.387 --> 22:26.386
Open up in there!

22:27.756 --> 22:28.788
All right,
we got it, guys.

22:28.790 --> 22:30.006
Step back. Step back!

22:30.842 --> 22:32.843
Police, Angela!
Open up!

22:39.800 --> 22:40.633
Angela!

22:40.635 --> 22:41.852
Angela, you okay?

22:41.854 --> 22:43.136
- We got shots fired.
- Turn around!

22:43.138 --> 22:44.571
Put your hands where
I can see them right now!

22:44.573 --> 22:46.306
Get 'em up!
Turn around slowly.

22:46.308 --> 22:47.691
That's it,
get your hands...

22:49.643 --> 22:50.911
You son of a bitch!
Drop it!

22:50.913 --> 22:52.529
Tony, look what
you made me do!

22:52.531 --> 22:54.147
Look what...
Drop it!

22:54.149 --> 22:56.917
Drop the gun!
Angela! Drop it!

22:56.919 --> 22:58.001
Against the wall!

22:58.003 --> 23:00.320
Against the wall.
Son of a bitch!

23:00.322 --> 23:02.539
Okay, wait a minute.
Come here.

23:02.541 --> 23:03.540
Get us a bus!

23:03.542 --> 23:04.508
Right now!

23:04.510 --> 23:07.210
170-10-54.
We need a bus!

23:17.159 --> 23:18.576
Just over an hour ago,

23:18.769 --> 23:20.535
City Councilman Anthony Mancini

23:20.537 --> 23:22.521
was admitted to St. Victor's
Medical Center

23:22.523 --> 23:25.373
after suffering
a gunshot wound to the abdomen.

23:25.375 --> 23:26.991
Police are questioning

23:26.993 --> 23:29.344
26-year-old Angela
Ferrara of Queens

23:29.346 --> 23:30.712
in connection with the shooting.

23:38.504 --> 23:41.172
Hiya, Frank.

23:43.025 --> 23:44.693
They say you got lucky.

23:44.695 --> 23:47.462
Ah, 18 years on the job,

23:47.464 --> 23:50.182
I never caught a bullet.

23:50.184 --> 23:52.951
Doc says it missed
all my major organs.

23:52.953 --> 23:54.452
Yeah.

23:54.454 --> 23:55.904
Press here yet?

23:55.906 --> 23:57.572
Oh, yeah.

23:59.942 --> 24:01.293
I brought this on myself.

24:01.295 --> 24:03.328
I knew she had a screw loose.

24:03.330 --> 24:05.697
It's a little more
than that now, Tony.

24:05.699 --> 24:07.349
Like attempted murder.

24:07.351 --> 24:09.551
Yeah.

24:10.419 --> 24:12.204
What happened?

24:12.206 --> 24:16.641
I knew I had to
break it off with Angela.

24:16.643 --> 24:18.510
So I went over to her place...

24:18.512 --> 24:19.895
Invited?

24:19.897 --> 24:21.229
Yeah.

24:21.231 --> 24:23.531
It's not like I busted in.

24:23.533 --> 24:26.184
When I told her
it was over,

24:26.186 --> 24:27.736
she went ballistic.

24:27.738 --> 24:30.238
Next thing I know,
she's slapping me...

24:30.240 --> 24:33.491
Goes into my coat
and grabs my gun, and...

24:35.111 --> 24:37.729
Frank, when I was
on the job,

24:37.731 --> 24:41.533
I must've talked 100 skells
into dropping their weapons.

24:41.535 --> 24:43.401
But not this girl.

24:43.403 --> 24:45.387
She just let me have it.

24:45.389 --> 24:47.756
Point-blank.

24:47.758 --> 24:50.108
And here you are.

24:50.110 --> 24:51.509
We're gonna move you
upstairs, Mr. Mancini.

24:51.511 --> 24:53.077
Oh, that's nice.
Thank you.

24:54.880 --> 24:56.047
Thanks for coming, Frank.

24:56.049 --> 24:57.549
And don't worry about the vote.

24:57.551 --> 24:59.351
I'm on top of it.

24:59.353 --> 25:01.286
Just take care of yourself.

25:10.846 --> 25:13.064
All we're trying to do
is get the truth!

25:13.066 --> 25:15.700
I swear to God
I didn't mean to shoot him.

25:15.702 --> 25:18.119
Angela, you pointed a gun at him
and you pulled the trigger.

25:18.121 --> 25:19.454
What did you think
was gonna happen?

25:19.456 --> 25:21.272
I was just trying to scare him.

25:21.274 --> 25:23.608
But he grabbed the damn gun
and it went off.

25:23.610 --> 25:25.527
Angela, why'd you even

25:25.529 --> 25:27.412
let Mancini back
into your apartment.

25:27.414 --> 25:30.665
I tried to end things
over the phone.

25:30.667 --> 25:32.534
But he insisted on coming over.

25:32.536 --> 25:33.969
Well, that's not
what Tony told us.

25:33.971 --> 25:36.388
Tony told us that he was going
over there to end it with you.

25:36.390 --> 25:38.306
Yeah?
Well, he's a frickin' liar!

25:38.308 --> 25:39.674
It's what he said.

25:39.676 --> 25:41.259
This would have
gone a lot better

25:41.261 --> 25:43.628
if you would have just leveled
with us in the beginning.

25:43.630 --> 25:45.413
And told us that this guy

25:45.415 --> 25:46.681
was abusing you.

25:48.517 --> 25:51.019
I was scared, okay?

25:51.021 --> 25:54.305
Tony can be
the sweetest guy.

25:54.307 --> 25:58.693
And then... he's... not.

26:00.479 --> 26:02.664
You don't know which
Tony's gonna show up.

26:02.666 --> 26:04.616
You know, it's kind of
ironic, Angela,

26:04.618 --> 26:06.317
because we've heard
the same thing about you.

26:06.319 --> 26:09.204
Nice.

26:09.206 --> 26:11.790
We're trying to
help you, Angela.

26:13.542 --> 26:16.127
Look, I've done a lot
of stupid things,

26:16.129 --> 26:18.296
but I don't go around
shooting people.

26:18.298 --> 26:20.215
Yeah, well, unfortunately,

26:20.217 --> 26:23.685
tonight you did shoot someone.

26:23.687 --> 26:25.637
So why don't you
tell us what happened?

26:26.505 --> 26:28.106
Come on, Angela.

26:28.108 --> 26:29.891
Did he put his hands on you?

26:29.893 --> 26:31.676
Did he hit you? Tonight?

26:31.678 --> 26:35.280
After I told him I didn't
want to see him anymore,

26:35.282 --> 26:36.981
he lost it.

26:36.983 --> 26:38.683
He shoved me against the wall.

26:38.685 --> 26:40.485
He said he was gonna kill me.

26:40.487 --> 26:41.986
Okay.

26:41.988 --> 26:43.154
And what happened next?

26:43.156 --> 26:45.857
I grabbed the gun.

26:45.859 --> 26:48.493
And I...

26:48.495 --> 26:50.829
if I didn't...

26:50.831 --> 26:53.081
I know he was gonna hurt me.

26:54.917 --> 26:57.252
I'm telling you
the truth!

26:57.254 --> 26:59.421
It was an accident.

27:04.093 --> 27:07.846
You asked me why I didn't tell
you that Tony slapped me around?

27:09.165 --> 27:12.734
Who's gonna take
my word over his?

27:12.736 --> 27:14.569
I'm nobody.

27:14.571 --> 27:16.821
I'm the crazy girlfriend.

27:18.791 --> 27:20.775
Now I'm going to go to jail

27:20.777 --> 27:22.994
for trying to stay alive.

27:24.396 --> 27:26.915
I would have believed you.

27:39.244 --> 27:40.712
You're gonna chop
your fingers off.

27:40.714 --> 27:43.298
Well, if it gets me
out of kitchen duty, great.

27:43.300 --> 27:44.632
You wish.

27:44.634 --> 27:47.802
Do you know if your boss is
going after Angela Ferrara?

27:50.139 --> 27:51.856
Well, nothing's been filed yet.

27:51.858 --> 27:55.226
But you know, Mancini and
the DA are golfing buddies.

27:55.228 --> 27:56.611
So you do the math.

27:57.980 --> 27:59.280
It will go to the grand jury.

27:59.282 --> 28:00.365
Great.

28:00.367 --> 28:01.816
I was kind of hoping
Mancini would just

28:01.818 --> 28:03.401
sweep the whole thing
under the rug, you know?

28:03.403 --> 28:05.887
There is not a rug big enough to hide that.
I know.

28:05.889 --> 28:07.455
And if Mancini walks away,

28:07.457 --> 28:09.657
he looks guilty, right?
Exactly.

28:12.579 --> 28:14.662
Missed Linda in church today.

28:14.664 --> 28:15.780
Yeah.

28:15.782 --> 28:18.282
She had a thing.

28:18.284 --> 28:19.250
A thing?

28:19.252 --> 28:21.386
Sunday morning?

28:21.388 --> 28:23.505
Yeah, it's like, as if
she didn't work enough.

28:23.507 --> 28:26.808
Some thing came up at work, so
now that turned into a thing...

28:26.810 --> 28:28.893
so she had a thing.

28:28.895 --> 28:29.844
Okay.

28:29.846 --> 28:31.462
So what's with the attitude?

28:31.464 --> 28:34.299
It's not as if you have
a spotless attendance record.

28:34.301 --> 28:36.484
I don't have an attitude.
I'm thinking about the boys.

28:36.486 --> 28:37.902
Really?

28:37.904 --> 28:39.521
They seem fine to me.

28:39.523 --> 28:44.475
Okay, let's just say I'm...
still adjusting.

28:44.477 --> 28:47.162
Okay? It's not like
I can just flip a switch.

28:47.164 --> 28:49.814
I know.

28:49.816 --> 28:51.866
You know, it's not like one of
those Book of the Month Club

28:51.868 --> 28:52.984
books that Linda reads,

28:52.986 --> 28:54.702
where the wife can just
magically juggle family

28:54.704 --> 28:56.087
and some glamorous career.

28:56.089 --> 28:58.039
I mean,
she went back to work

28:58.041 --> 28:59.657
in the blood and guts of the ER

28:59.659 --> 29:02.627
in large part because
we need a paycheck.

29:04.346 --> 29:06.798
It's not some
romantic choice she made.

29:07.633 --> 29:09.166
So...?

29:09.168 --> 29:12.437
So I wish I could
still give her that choice.

29:20.012 --> 29:21.446
I think she likes it.

29:21.448 --> 29:23.364
I think she really
missed it, Danny.

29:23.366 --> 29:25.617
Really?
Yeah.

29:27.903 --> 29:30.187
That is way
too much radicchio.

29:37.529 --> 29:40.532
This smells...
different than usual.

29:40.534 --> 29:44.302
I don't know, I followed Linda's
recipe to the T, Gramps.

29:45.754 --> 29:48.006
What'd you do to it?

29:48.008 --> 29:49.724
What are you talking...

29:49.726 --> 29:51.476
It smells fine;
there's nothing wrong with it.

29:51.478 --> 29:53.377
It's disgusting.
- It's not good. -It's terrible.

29:53.379 --> 29:54.612
It's horrible.
It's really bad.

29:54.614 --> 29:55.880
Are you kidding me?
It's really bad.

29:55.882 --> 29:57.098
Must be the cheese,
I don't know.

29:57.100 --> 29:58.600
They didn't have the, uh,

29:58.602 --> 30:01.019
Asiago cheese or "Gryer"
when I went to the market, so...

30:01.021 --> 30:02.937
It's "Gruyere,"
Uncle Danny.

30:02.939 --> 30:04.239
Gruyere, Gryer, whatever.

30:04.241 --> 30:06.407
All they had was the cheese
in a can, so I used that.

30:06.409 --> 30:08.443
- In a can.
- What?

30:08.445 --> 30:10.394
Canned cheese?

30:10.396 --> 30:11.562
Come on.

30:11.564 --> 30:13.731
Cheese is cheese! What?

30:13.733 --> 30:15.817
Not if it's in a can.

30:15.819 --> 30:17.068
Sorry I'm late.

30:17.070 --> 30:18.920
Hi.
Hey.

30:18.922 --> 30:19.904
Hi.

30:19.906 --> 30:21.089
Hey.

30:21.091 --> 30:22.140
Thanks, Frank.

30:22.142 --> 30:24.259
We made you a plate.
Thank you.

30:24.261 --> 30:25.710
Don't eat the mac and cheese.

30:25.712 --> 30:27.745
Okay.

30:27.747 --> 30:29.914
You'll eat yours.

30:29.916 --> 30:31.182
You get to see Angela?

30:31.184 --> 30:32.550
Yep.
All right.

30:32.552 --> 30:34.185
Who's that?

30:34.187 --> 30:36.854
She's the victim in
a domestic violence case.

30:36.856 --> 30:38.456
What's domestic violence?

30:38.458 --> 30:40.408
It's usually when a man
hurts his wife or kids.

30:40.410 --> 30:42.427
Or, in this case,
his girlfriend.

30:42.429 --> 30:43.761
Like, hits them?

30:43.763 --> 30:44.946
Yeah, bullies grow up too,

30:44.948 --> 30:46.314
but cops like your dad and me

30:46.316 --> 30:47.649
and attorneys like
your Aunt Erin

30:47.651 --> 30:48.933
try to make sure
they're stopped.

30:48.935 --> 30:50.401
You need to be careful.

30:50.403 --> 30:52.654
You treated her; you might be
called as a witness in the case.

30:52.656 --> 30:54.105
Erin, I had to see her.

30:54.107 --> 30:56.074
How's she doing?
Not great.

30:56.076 --> 30:57.792
Well, what'd you say to her?

30:57.794 --> 31:00.128
Told her who I was late
for Sunday dinner with,

31:00.130 --> 31:01.663
and said I would ask
the bunch of you

31:01.665 --> 31:03.331
to make sure that
justice was served.

31:04.116 --> 31:06.283
I'm all for justice.

31:06.285 --> 31:08.553
But not a rush to judgment.

31:08.555 --> 31:09.671
Well, as far as I'm concerned,

31:09.673 --> 31:11.005
Mancini's hands are
definitely not clean

31:11.007 --> 31:13.224
in this one.
You got any evidence of that?

31:13.226 --> 31:14.559
Well, if I had any evidence,

31:14.561 --> 31:16.628
then Angela wouldn't
be locked up, as you know.

31:16.630 --> 31:18.295
She is in a tough spot.

31:18.297 --> 31:20.832
Guy with Mancini's juice
has the system wired.

31:20.834 --> 31:23.134
The councilman hasn't been
charged with a crime.

31:23.136 --> 31:24.385
Maybe because he's
a powerful politician.

31:24.387 --> 31:27.138
Lots of powerful people
end up in prison, Nicky.

31:27.140 --> 31:29.190
Yes, but not as many
as deserve to be.

31:29.192 --> 31:32.377
Last I heard, you're the one who
can't make a case against him.

31:32.379 --> 31:34.862
Well, it's not like people are
exactly rushing to cooperate

31:34.864 --> 31:38.032
with someone investigating
the commissioner's pal.

31:43.989 --> 31:46.207
Know what I'm hungry for?

31:46.209 --> 31:48.676
I am hungry for dessert.

31:48.678 --> 31:50.995
I'm gonna get started on it.

31:50.997 --> 31:52.296
I'll join you.

31:52.298 --> 31:54.115
Not with the preparation.

31:54.117 --> 31:55.466
Don't worry, Gramps.

31:55.468 --> 31:56.851
You'll love my cheesecake.

32:21.326 --> 32:23.461
Jack forgot his backpack.

32:23.463 --> 32:26.247
Great way to get out of  yo.

32:28.033 --> 32:30.551
You know, Angela officially
changed the story

32:30.553 --> 32:32.420
of how she ended up in the E.R.

32:32.422 --> 32:34.705
I know that.

32:35.641 --> 32:37.592
But don't you think
it's just going to

32:37.594 --> 32:40.244
look like she's lying
to stay out of jail?

32:40.246 --> 32:43.047
Of course it is.

32:43.049 --> 32:44.482
Danny...

32:44.484 --> 32:47.268
you may not want to
hear this, but...

32:47.270 --> 32:50.655
have you found any
evidence of self-defense?

32:50.657 --> 32:53.574
She told me that
Mancini pushed her down,

32:53.576 --> 32:54.859
and threatened to kill her.

32:54.861 --> 32:57.578
His former C.O.'s
been stonewalling me,

32:57.580 --> 32:58.830
and nobody anywhere--

32:58.832 --> 33:01.949
anywhere-- has a bad word
to say about this guy.

33:04.169 --> 33:06.437
You're a good cop
with good instincts.

33:06.439 --> 33:07.789
Thank you.

33:07.791 --> 33:09.406
You seem so certain.

33:10.259 --> 33:12.076
Are you?

33:12.911 --> 33:15.329
Yes.

33:41.451 --> 33:44.870
Mancini got Councilman Garcia
and Tong to sign on,

33:44.872 --> 33:47.289
and he's trying to
nail down Vogel by tonight,

33:47.291 --> 33:48.707
which would put us
over the top.

33:48.709 --> 33:50.659
Good.
Good?

33:50.661 --> 33:53.912
For a man who's about
to dodge a big bullet...

33:57.133 --> 34:01.804
Mancini may have slapped
around Angela Ferrara.

34:03.590 --> 34:06.008
Do they have enough
to bring charges?

34:06.010 --> 34:07.893
No.

34:07.895 --> 34:08.960
So...

34:08.963 --> 34:11.179
what are we talking about?

34:11.981 --> 34:14.266
I read the file,
I read the report,

34:14.268 --> 34:16.150
I talked to Danny...

34:16.152 --> 34:17.735
talked to Linda.

34:17.737 --> 34:21.806
No one feels this girl fell down
the stairs three nights ago.

34:21.809 --> 34:24.659
We lose Mancini...

34:24.661 --> 34:26.978
we lose the vote,

34:26.980 --> 34:28.864
and a big chunk of the budget.

34:30.251 --> 34:32.501
You're putting a very high price
on one girl's problems.

34:34.152 --> 34:35.786
I didn't hear you say that,
Garrett.

34:35.789 --> 34:37.706
Frank...

34:37.708 --> 34:39.757
the law says Mancini's innocent

34:39.760 --> 34:42.344
until someone says different,
and no one has.

34:42.346 --> 34:43.896
So...

34:43.898 --> 34:46.681
what are you looking for, Frank?

34:46.684 --> 34:49.668
What are <i>we</i> looking for,
Garrett?

34:54.507 --> 34:56.692
The truth.

35:07.103 --> 35:09.204
Commissioner.

35:09.206 --> 35:10.539
Thanks for coming,
Lieutenant.

35:10.541 --> 35:12.541
I didn't want to go
up to your precinct;

35:12.543 --> 35:14.743
they make such
a big deal out of it.

35:14.745 --> 35:16.795
Everybody jumps to attention.

35:16.797 --> 35:18.113
People talk.

35:18.115 --> 35:20.415
Sit down.

35:23.253 --> 35:25.921
The other day,

35:25.923 --> 35:29.541
two detectives came to
see you for information

35:29.543 --> 35:31.426
regarding a domestic
violence case

35:31.428 --> 35:33.595
involving Councilman Mancini.

35:33.597 --> 35:34.663
Yeah.

35:34.665 --> 35:37.882
I had some words
with your son, maybe...

35:37.884 --> 35:40.886
That would be between you and
Detectives Reagan and Curatola.

35:41.721 --> 35:43.238
I'd like to talk
about that case.

35:43.240 --> 35:44.606
You know, with all
due respect, sir,

35:44.608 --> 35:46.725
there was no case.

35:46.727 --> 35:49.695
Just a lot of questions
about a decorated cop

35:49.697 --> 35:51.113
with nothing
to back them up.

35:51.115 --> 35:53.198
I know all about
Mancini's medals.

35:53.200 --> 35:55.617
I'm the guy who hung
them around his neck.

35:56.452 --> 35:58.903
Yes, sir.

35:58.905 --> 36:02.958
But being a good cop
doesn't put any of us

36:02.960 --> 36:04.626
above the law.

36:04.628 --> 36:08.096
Not Tony, not me...

36:08.098 --> 36:10.132
and not you.

36:13.252 --> 36:15.971
You were his commanding
officer for six years.

36:15.973 --> 36:18.523
A good C.O. knows his men--

36:18.525 --> 36:20.142
who drinks, who gambles,

36:20.144 --> 36:22.361
who steps out on his wife.

36:24.430 --> 36:26.031
You're a good C.O.,
Lieutenant.

36:26.899 --> 36:28.867
I like to think so.

36:28.869 --> 36:30.953
Then you would know

36:30.955 --> 36:33.372
if Anthony Mancini
had a problem

36:33.374 --> 36:36.458
in his relationships
with women.

36:39.412 --> 36:42.631
Nobody likes to inform
on a fellow officer.

36:44.500 --> 36:45.968
And we all give

36:45.970 --> 36:48.220
the benefit of the doubt
to our own.

36:49.622 --> 36:53.342
But there is a line
we don't cross,

36:53.344 --> 36:55.510
and secrets we can't keep.

36:55.512 --> 36:57.562
You understand?

36:59.315 --> 37:01.767
Yes, sir.
Good.

37:01.769 --> 37:04.186
Then you also understand

37:04.188 --> 37:06.355
that Anthony Mancini's career

37:06.357 --> 37:09.191
is not the only one
on the line.

37:21.854 --> 37:23.255
I get it, David.

37:23.257 --> 37:25.640
I can make that work.

37:26.259 --> 37:28.660
So do we have a deal?

37:29.512 --> 37:31.430
Outstanding.

37:31.432 --> 37:33.665
Luger's on me when
I get out of here.

37:33.667 --> 37:35.834
All right.

37:35.836 --> 37:37.135
Councilman Vogel?

37:37.137 --> 37:39.237
Signed, sealed
and delivered.

37:39.239 --> 37:41.940
Congratulations, Frank,
you got your budget back.

37:41.942 --> 37:44.009
I love it when
the good guys win.

37:45.578 --> 37:47.779
Do you, now?

37:52.652 --> 37:56.788
The D.A. is moving to indict
Angela on attempted murder.

37:56.790 --> 37:59.374
Yeah, I heard.

37:59.376 --> 38:01.192
I feel terrible for her.

38:06.132 --> 38:07.799
You care about this girl?

38:07.801 --> 38:09.801
Sure.

38:09.803 --> 38:11.803
I wish there was
something I could do.

38:11.805 --> 38:13.672
There is.

38:13.674 --> 38:14.973
How's that?

38:14.975 --> 38:16.174
You can tell the truth.

38:16.176 --> 38:18.543
Admit the shooting
was an accident.

38:19.412 --> 38:21.646
Now why would I do that?

38:21.648 --> 38:22.731
Because we both know

38:22.733 --> 38:25.317
she was defending
herself against you.

38:28.604 --> 38:31.573
Let me get this
straight, Frank.

38:31.575 --> 38:34.326
After all that
we've been through,

38:34.328 --> 38:36.912
you're going to take
this girl's word over mine?

38:38.748 --> 38:40.949
It's not just her word, Tony.

38:42.835 --> 38:44.736
It's Cynthia Mercer's word.

38:44.738 --> 38:47.739
And Debbie Gorsky.

38:47.741 --> 38:49.541
And Amy Webber's word.

38:49.543 --> 38:53.095
All three lodged assault
complaints against you,

38:53.097 --> 38:56.631
but, somehow, all three
just went into the wind.

38:56.633 --> 38:58.450
With no official record.

39:05.475 --> 39:07.759
So what do you want, Frank?

39:07.761 --> 39:09.561
This isn't just a black eye

39:09.563 --> 39:10.812
or a broken wrist, Tony.

39:10.814 --> 39:13.031
They get her on
attempted murder,

39:13.033 --> 39:15.099
that's up to 25 years

39:15.101 --> 39:16.568
with a minimum
two-thirds served.

39:16.570 --> 39:19.821
16 and a half years
in prison

39:19.823 --> 39:22.958
because she made the mistake
of thinking Tony Mancini

39:22.960 --> 39:24.275
was a stand-up guy.

39:24.277 --> 39:26.044
We're talking about
my career, here!

39:26.046 --> 39:27.111
My life!

39:27.113 --> 39:29.548
And 16 and a half
years of hers.

39:37.807 --> 39:41.643
I have been a real good
friend to you, Frank.

39:41.645 --> 39:43.395
And the department.

39:45.231 --> 39:47.482
And I can just as easily
pick up that phone

39:47.484 --> 39:49.868
and make a case for
cutting your budget.

39:55.158 --> 39:57.876
That's the worst thing
you could have said, Tony.

40:01.697 --> 40:03.915
You don't know me at all.

40:09.338 --> 40:11.506
I didn't mean to hurt her.

40:11.508 --> 40:14.092
I just...

40:14.844 --> 40:17.596
You earned a chest
full of medals

40:17.598 --> 40:20.265
for being a stand-up guy.

40:20.267 --> 40:22.467
For doing the right thing.

40:24.937 --> 40:27.772
Somehow I don't see you
putting her away

40:27.774 --> 40:30.341
for something you're
responsible for.

40:31.176 --> 40:33.078
But then...

40:33.080 --> 40:36.882
maybe I'm just a lousy
judge of character.

40:50.362 --> 40:53.965
A lovely bottle of some French wine
for you, my dear.

40:53.967 --> 40:54.916
Thank you.

40:54.918 --> 40:56.468
I better go easy
on the wine, though.

40:56.470 --> 40:57.719
I might fall asleep.

40:57.721 --> 41:01.756
Oh, don't even think about it.

41:01.758 --> 41:03.925
It's my sister.

41:05.411 --> 41:07.095
Hello, sis.

41:07.097 --> 41:08.880
I just heard that Tony Mancini

41:08.882 --> 41:11.766
is going to testify that
the shooting was an accident.

41:11.768 --> 41:14.052
We're dropping the charges
against Angela.

41:14.054 --> 41:16.104
Really?
Well, that's great news.

41:16.106 --> 41:17.722
Mm-hmm. So, listen...

41:17.724 --> 41:19.724
I have no plans for tonight.

41:19.726 --> 41:21.826
Do you want to go out
with Linda, and...?

41:21.828 --> 41:23.278
Uh... no, you know,

41:23.280 --> 41:25.196
I think we're good here, sis.

41:25.198 --> 41:27.231
I'm really okay with coming over
and taking care of the boys...

41:27.233 --> 41:30.785
No, I said we're good,
good night, thank you.

41:31.671 --> 41:33.905
Mancini backed down.

41:33.907 --> 41:35.406
Angela's gonna walk.

41:35.408 --> 41:37.259
Wow. That's great.

41:37.261 --> 41:38.710
Yeah.

41:38.712 --> 41:39.761
Yeah.

41:39.763 --> 41:40.795
Whatever that looks like.

41:40.797 --> 41:42.580
Yeah, who knows?

41:43.800 --> 41:46.217
You think your father had
something to do with that?

41:46.219 --> 41:47.886
Old man had something
to do with it,

41:47.888 --> 41:49.971
you know he's not
gonna tell us.

41:49.973 --> 41:51.890
The only way he'd have it.

41:51.892 --> 41:55.143
So, is there anything
else I can get you, ma'am?

41:55.145 --> 41:56.728
Like a, uh, I don't know,

41:56.730 --> 41:58.863
pipe, or slippers...

41:58.865 --> 42:00.982
I'm good right here.
Good.

42:00.984 --> 42:03.151
Good.

42:05.371 --> 42:07.438
You know, if my sister, um...

42:07.440 --> 42:08.707
asks to babysit again,

42:08.709 --> 42:10.875
I think we should say no.

42:10.877 --> 42:12.627
Okay. Why?

42:12.629 --> 42:13.812
Because I know my sister,

42:13.814 --> 42:15.947
and I know what she's up to.
Which is what?

42:16.832 --> 42:19.334
Her ex-husband's
first foot out the door

42:19.336 --> 42:22.337
was when she went back to work
after Nicky was born.

42:22.339 --> 42:24.723
She probably thinks the same
thing's happening with us.

42:24.725 --> 42:27.475
She's trying to run
some prevent-offense.

42:27.477 --> 42:29.728
You think?

42:29.730 --> 42:31.563
Yeah.

42:31.565 --> 42:33.315
But she'd be wrong.

42:33.317 --> 42:35.483
I'm not that guy.

42:37.186 --> 42:39.104
I'm the guy that is
very proud of you

42:39.106 --> 42:41.189
and is going to
stand by you 100%.

42:42.992 --> 42:45.410
Eh... 80%.

42:45.412 --> 42:48.663
Ah... 85%.
Yeah.

42:49.498 --> 42:50.699
Okay.
