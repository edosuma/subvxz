00:24.558 --> 00:29.428
    Reid, Ben, and Darrin
    and I, we've been
    friends for a while now.

00:29.430 --> 00:33.032
    They were just normal guys,
    you know, like, everyday,

00:33.034 --> 00:34.466
    the kind of guys, you know,
    you would just

00:34.468 --> 00:36.068
  go watch a football game with

00:36.070 --> 00:38.237
     or, you know, have a beer.

00:38.239 --> 00:40.472
   They're not crazy people.
   They're just regular guys.

00:40.474 --> 00:43.709
     Um, and it's not like
     them to just take off.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.044
     REID'S SISTER: <i> Reid was</i>
    <i> the best brother</i>

00:45.046 --> 00:46.311
       <i> anyone could have.</i>

00:46.313 --> 00:47.780
   <i> He always took care of me.</i>

00:47.782 --> 00:50.282
           This is the old Reid
           over here.

00:50.284 --> 00:52.618
      He was really great
      at sports and really
      liked to play the guitar.

00:52.620 --> 00:56.188
      And then this is
      the new crazy Reid.

00:56.190 --> 00:59.091
         All this crazy reading
         material about UFOs,

00:59.093 --> 01:01.060
           weird DVDs and maps.

01:02.730 --> 01:05.464
   Reid stopped
   returning my phone calls.

01:05.465 --> 01:08.133
  And then I got really scared
  when he got fired.

01:08.135 --> 01:09.635
         As I said, he was
         a great, great, uh,

01:09.637 --> 01:11.236
          asset to the company.

01:11.238 --> 01:14.173
      But about three months
      before he disappeared,

01:14.175 --> 01:17.509
         he had a real change
         in attitude.

01:17.511 --> 01:20.479
         He came to work late.
         He spent a lot of
         time on the Internet.

01:20.481 --> 01:23.682
     Stuff that we found
     in his desk after he left,

01:23.684 --> 01:25.350
      a bunch of color pictures
      of UFOs.

01:27.321 --> 01:29.388
      My brother wouldn't
      just disappear.

01:29.390 --> 01:30.789
    Three people aren't just
    gonna disappear.

01:30.791 --> 01:33.158
     Something is going on.

01:33.160 --> 01:34.726
    And the fact that nobody
    knows anything,

01:34.728 --> 01:36.328
   nobody will talk to us...

01:36.330 --> 01:38.464
   Everybody's avoiding us.
   For what?

01:38.466 --> 01:40.766
  Somebody knows something,
  and they're not telling us.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.334
    I would think that a person

01:42.336 --> 01:46.338
        who tried to sneak into
        Area 51 and get video,

01:46.340 --> 01:48.373
    even a person who succeeded
    in getting that video,

01:48.375 --> 01:49.274
   would be in serious trouble.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.670
  The camera's the girl?
         DARRIN: The camera
         is the girl.

02:01.671 --> 02:03.554
   Like, practice with it.
   Like, what do you say
   to these girls? (CHUCKLES)

02:03.557 --> 02:05.824
    Hello. My name is Reid.

02:05.826 --> 02:07.693
  What's yours? (LAUGHS)
             (LAUGHS)

02:07.695 --> 02:09.495
   And then we'd start
   a conversation

02:09.497 --> 02:10.628
   about, you know,
   what the other one does...

02:10.631 --> 02:12.131
          Fascinating.

02:12.133 --> 02:13.165
 This is like a brand new...

02:13.167 --> 02:14.600
         DARRIN: It's like a...

02:14.602 --> 02:16.168
 I might try this tonight,
 I don't know.

02:16.169 --> 02:17.735
   DARRIN: This is a new thing.
 It's revolutionary.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.771
  We just need Ben
  not to screw it up.

02:19.773 --> 02:21.273
    Oh, I will not screw it up.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.558
 DARRIN: You are a massive
 cock block.

02:22.559 --> 02:23.842
 I am not a massive cock block.
         DARRIN: Yes, you are.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.477
   I am a good friend

02:25.479 --> 02:28.580
    that just tries to
    encourage his roommate...
 (LAUGHS)

02:28.582 --> 02:31.250

 I will never block
 another man's cock, all right?

 REID: (LAUGHS) Says the man in
 the sherbet cardigan.

02:33.687 --> 02:36.288
 (LAUGHS)
           Okay, first of all,
           this is not sherbet.

02:36.290 --> 02:39.458
       This is a salmon-colored
       cardigan.
              (LAUGHS)

02:39.460 --> 02:40.726
     DARRIN: You looked up
     the def...

02:40.728 --> 02:42.545
       Yeah.
  DARRIN: Great, let's hear it.

02:42.546 --> 02:44.363
 It's a picture of
 your face, man.
             (LAUGHS)

      any houses up here.

             DARRIN: Done.

  and then beer pong.

 Oh, Jesus.

03:03.918 --> 03:04.883
    Thank you. Thank you.
        Take one. Pass it down.

      just don't drop it.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.689
 All right. My babies.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.758
    If we win, you have to jump
    in the pool naked.

03:12.760 --> 03:15.194
  You know I like being naked.
  I'm not worried about that.

03:15.196 --> 03:16.762
     I was talking to Danielle,
     but if you...

03:16.764 --> 03:18.797
 I'll make that
 bet for both of us.

   You have to rap.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.639
        We're gonna need
        all these suits.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.157
       BEN: Yo, Darrin.
       I wanna show you
       something I found.

07:05.159 --> 07:06.458
          BEN: A little story
          for you guys.

07:06.460 --> 07:08.460
   Iraqi insurgent thinking,

07:08.462 --> 07:10.929
    "I'm gonna do some
    terrorist activity here
    against Americans."

07:10.931 --> 07:12.831
            BEN: Uh, they think
            no one can see 'em.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.666
    DARRIN: Where are you going
    with this?

07:14.668 --> 07:17.469
   BEN: So, I think they remind
   me of you and Reid.

07:17.471 --> 07:19.671
   "We're fine. It's
   nighttime. You can't see us.

07:19.673 --> 07:23.475
        "Who can see at night?"
        And...

07:23.477 --> 07:27.512
         "No! What's happening?
         No! Run! Run, Ahmed.

07:27.514 --> 07:29.481
  "Oh, Ahmed, you're dead too."

07:29.483 --> 07:30.782
    And that,
    my friends, is what happens

07:30.784 --> 07:31.883
    when you fuck with
    the American government.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.151
       They fuck you up.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.786
             They're not gonna
             be able to see us.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.755
           'Cause we got these.

07:36.757 --> 07:37.989
         REID: I have a plan.
  There's always a plan, Ben.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.724
        Sure, there is.

07:39.726 --> 07:42.093
     BEN: Got to take this.
     Whassup?

07:42.095 --> 07:44.563
  No, we're going out of town
  for the weekend.

07:44.565 --> 07:46.932
      Secret mission.
      Yeah, that's right.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.806
       Hey, is Ben still
       on the phone?

07:54.808 --> 07:57.542
   BEN: No, I cannot tell you
   where we're going.

07:57.544 --> 07:59.010
  (WHISPERS) It's a pretty good
  opportunity to try
  this thing out.

08:01.982 --> 08:05.484
       BEN: Sure. I don't
       think girls...

08:05.486 --> 08:06.485
 REID: (WHISPERS) I'm just
 gonna find his frequency.

08:06.487 --> 08:07.486
            BEN: What? Really?

08:08.822 --> 08:10.121
 REID: (WHISPERS) Ready.

08:10.123 --> 08:11.490
         (SIGNAL BEEPS)

08:14.528 --> 08:16.661
 REID: (WHISPERS) Ready.
            BEN: Ashley?

08:16.663 --> 08:18.763
 REID: (WHISPERS)
 Told you it would work.
        (GRUNTS IN FRUSTRATION)

08:18.765 --> 08:19.631
 REID: (WHISPERS) All right,
 I'm going to cut it off.

08:22.202 --> 08:23.902
 Let him get back on the phone.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.974
  BEN: Hey, sorry,
  I don't know what happened.

08:28.976 --> 08:32.644
   Yeah, we'll definitely...
   Mini-golf date is set.

08:32.645 --> 08:33.945
         (SIGNAL BEEPS)

08:36.082 --> 08:36.914
       BEN: God damn it.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.751
         Stupid phone.
              (CHUCKLES)

08:40.821 --> 08:42.053
            (LAUGHS)

08:42.054 --> 08:43.221
    What are you guys doing?

08:43.222 --> 08:44.222
 REID: The jammer works.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.824
           (LAUGHTER)

08:47.794 --> 08:48.760
 We need flashlights.

08:48.762 --> 08:51.763
 BEN: What are
 the tennis balls for?
    REID: Don't worry about it.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.598
 Four cameras. Yes.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.935
 Six batteries.
 Two, four, six, yep.

08:56.937 --> 08:59.338
           BEN: You really need
           four cameras?

08:59.339 --> 09:01.740
 DARRIN: Wearable. So we can
 attach to our clothes
 whatever, under our arm.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.241
 Comes pretty handy.

09:03.243 --> 09:06.044
     REID: And, as you can see,
     that is you.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.812
       BEN: Sweet. There I am.
         REID: There you are.

09:07.814 --> 09:08.547
    DARRIN: It will come in
    handy at some point.

09:09.783 --> 09:12.284
    BEN: There's so much
    cool shit on this table.

09:12.286 --> 09:15.287
          Ben, be careful
          with that, all right?
          Just don't drop that.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.558
                 Okay, pills.

09:19.560 --> 09:20.859
 Just three, just three.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.294
                Okay, I'm good.

09:22.296 --> 09:24.229
    BEN: Darrin, where are you?

09:24.231 --> 09:25.864
     REID: Dude, we got to
     get going.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.265
    BEN: Come on out, buddy.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.603
   Dude, those ammonia pills
   are brutal.

09:31.605 --> 09:33.972
 You're doing a lot
 of work there, Darrin.
            (CHUCKLES)

09:33.974 --> 09:35.640
   REID: It's an essential
   part of the trip, Darrin.

09:35.642 --> 09:37.175
              Hey, when did
              we get this?
  REID: Taser gun?

09:37.177 --> 09:39.811
    Taser. God, I love America.

09:39.813 --> 09:42.147
 Don't mess with
 that thing, all right?
                   Oh! (LAUGHS)

09:42.149 --> 09:44.749
        DARRIN: Careful.
        Careful, dude.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.651
               (CHUCKLES)
 DARRIN: You can
 shock yourself.

09:46.653 --> 09:47.819
  BEN: Do you really think that
  can fuck someone up, though?

09:47.821 --> 09:49.220
         DARRIN: Yeah.

09:49.222 --> 09:51.990
 Come on. Come on,
 let's get packing.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.760
          (GRUNTS)

09:55.762 --> 09:57.762
     DARRIN: Dude, are you
     all right?

09:57.764 --> 09:59.364
  BEN: Okay, that hurts a lot.

09:59.366 --> 10:00.298
 REID: Are you okay?

10:00.300 --> 10:01.933
                Oh, man!

10:01.935 --> 10:03.234
    Oh, that will work.
    That will take someone out.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.371
             Feel like I'm
             more of a man now.

10:06.373 --> 10:08.039
           It does really work.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.307
 That's what you
 look like right now.

10:09.309 --> 10:10.609
 Never leave dangerous toys
 around children.

10:11.979 --> 10:12.877
       (SIGHS)

10:13.180 --> 10:14.379
                     Let's go.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.783
 DARRIN: You nervous?
          Huh?

10:18.785 --> 10:20.018
        We're doing it.
        We're doing it.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.286
  It's gonna be awesome, dude.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.621
   This is what's gonna happen.

10:22.623 --> 10:25.023
              We're gonna drive
              up to the border,

10:25.025 --> 10:27.125
       or wherever I'm dropping
       you guys off,

10:27.127 --> 10:28.727
          uh, say our goodbyes.

10:28.729 --> 10:29.828
               You're gonna get
               out of the car,

10:29.830 --> 10:30.629
               Reid's gonna get
               out of the car.

10:30.631 --> 10:33.015
            Walk about 15 feet,

10:33.016 --> 10:35.400
     and then you're both gonna
     be shot in the head by
     snipers in the hills.

10:35.402 --> 10:36.901
              And I'm gonna be
              crying in the car

10:36.903 --> 10:38.103
         because my two
         best friends are dead.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.137
 We're not gonna
 get shot, all right?

10:39.139 --> 10:40.639
   DARRIN: You'd cry for us?

10:40.640 --> 10:42.140
 The worst that could
 happen is we get arrested.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.908
 And we're not gonna
 get arrested 'cause
 I got a plan.

10:43.910 --> 10:46.945
   It would be easier to rob
   a bank than to break
   into Area 51.

10:46.947 --> 10:48.680
            And people that
            rob banks get shot.

10:48.682 --> 10:50.181
 That's 'cause a bank
 expects to be robbed.

10:50.183 --> 10:51.950
 Nobody expects anyone
 to break into the base.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.785
            BEN: That's because
            it's impossible.
 Ben, look at this.

10:53.787 --> 10:56.021
 Look at all this
 land mass here, okay?

10:56.023 --> 10:59.124
 How are they
 gonna patrol all that?
 It's not possible.

10:59.126 --> 11:00.325
 This guy we're gonna
 meet tomorrow, Norio,

11:00.327 --> 11:02.160
 walked across at daylight.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.129
 It's the size of Connecticut.
 You can't patrol all that.

11:04.131 --> 11:05.830
              It's a top secret
              government base.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.666
    There's probably a bunch of
    other things happening...

11:07.668 --> 11:09.734
 There's no way they have dudes
 all around this circle.

11:09.736 --> 11:11.936
 Yeah, there's motion sensors,
 there's ammonia sensors.

11:11.938 --> 11:14.172
 There's all kinds of
 security measures, but
 we're gonna get around it.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.441
 You're gonna get around it
 until you're shot in the head.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.009
 BEN: You guys are all talk.
 This is never gonna happen.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.978
 I understand that

11:19.980 --> 11:21.346
 Reid's gone a little crazy
 in the last three months.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.714
 No offense, Reid.

11:22.716 --> 11:24.449
 Who wouldn't want to see this?

11:24.451 --> 11:27.452
      You wouldn't want to see
      footage of Area 51 inside
      of the base?

11:27.454 --> 11:29.754
         I don't understand why
         you're so confused
         why I wanna go.

11:29.756 --> 11:31.756
 Because this has been,
 this has all happened
 very quickly,

11:31.758 --> 11:33.191
 and suddenly
 we're going there.

11:33.193 --> 11:36.394
 And I don't know why
 you have just accepted it.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.997
           All I know is that
           no one has ever seen
           footage of the base.

11:38.999 --> 11:42.033
    No one's ever been there.
    No civilian's ever seen it.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.402
     We could be the first ones
     to do it. That would be
     the biggest...

11:44.404 --> 11:45.804
              What could be
              bigger than that?

11:45.806 --> 11:48.173
 Really good job
 manipulating Darrin, Reid.

11:48.175 --> 11:50.341
          (SIGHS) Just drive us
          to the border, okay?

11:50.343 --> 11:54.112
 Hello? We're, uh, about
 a couple hours from Vegas.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.247
 BEN: Yeah, he's talking
 to that girl again.

11:56.249 --> 11:57.949
  DARRIN: She's not crazy.
  You've never met her before.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.751
    Yeah, but he hasn't either,
    man. He trusts her.

11:59.753 --> 12:01.386
            He already told her
            what we're doing
            and everything.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.254
     I don't know why he thinks
     this girl's so legitimate.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.023
     DARRIN: You know,
     her dad worked there.

12:05.025 --> 12:07.859
    No, her dad wrote a book
    and claims he worked there.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.394
   You guys don't know anything
   about this chick.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.930
  You're just trusting her.
  I can make a fucking website.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.264
          Even if she shows up,

12:13.266 --> 12:14.365
       Reid doesn't really know
       anything about her.

12:14.367 --> 12:15.500
 DARRIN: What's the deal, dude?

12:15.502 --> 12:17.035
          We're good.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.403
 She's gonna meet us tomorrow.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.138
        Just because
        someone wrote a book...

12:20.140 --> 12:22.340
 If he went to MIT and did work
 for the government,

12:22.342 --> 12:25.410
    it makes sense that
    he'd be able to write
    a legitimate-sounding book.

12:25.412 --> 12:28.279
       That doesn't mean
       it's legitimate.

12:28.281 --> 12:30.148
 Well, that's what
 we're trying to find out.

12:30.149 --> 12:32.016
 And then he killed himself,
 so he's clearly stable-minded.

12:32.018 --> 12:33.051
       You don't have actual...

12:33.053 --> 12:35.103
 Ben, Ben, Ben, okay.

12:35.104 --> 12:37.154
 We know how to get past
 the security measures
 outside the base,

12:37.157 --> 12:39.224
 but we don't know what to do
 when we get on the base.

12:39.226 --> 12:41.860
 I need his information.
 She's the only one who has it.

12:41.862 --> 12:45.296
     So if she is full of shit,
     we can go home?

12:45.298 --> 12:46.998
 If she's full of shit,
 we gotta find another way.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.967
    DARRIN: You don't have
    to say anything to her.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.202
 Oh, I'll say something to her.

12:51.204 --> 12:52.537
     DARRIN: (CHUCKLES)
     Don't. Don't do dick.

12:52.539 --> 12:54.172
 Please don't.

12:58.478 --> 12:59.944
 There we go.

12:59.946 --> 13:02.046
        I talked to, uh,
        Glenn Campbell.

13:02.048 --> 13:03.448
 Okay.
           The guide,

13:03.450 --> 13:05.049
     and he's gonna
     show us this, like...

13:05.051 --> 13:06.451
       Who are all these people
       you're talking to?

13:06.453 --> 13:08.486
 Cameras, wearable cameras.

13:08.488 --> 13:09.220
 I'll wear one,
 and you wear the other.

13:09.222 --> 13:10.488
             Okay.

13:10.490 --> 13:11.990
 We'll check for night vision.

13:11.992 --> 13:13.291
               There's no way
               I'm wearing one.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.492
          You can get that shit
          into a strip club

13:14.494 --> 13:16.311
               and the bouncers
               and all that...

13:16.312 --> 13:18.129
      There's a lot of security
      at strip clubs, I know,
      trust me.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.964
             And if you can get
             that shit in there

13:19.966 --> 13:21.566
          and no one finds out,
          you're gold.

13:21.568 --> 13:25.837
      REID: Okay! Vegas!
      Enough Area 51 talk!

13:25.839 --> 13:27.839
     That's the least
     I've ever been excited
     about going to Vegas.

13:27.841 --> 13:29.908
      DARRIN: Look at this.
      Just like Candyland.

13:29.910 --> 13:32.410
 BEN: Look at that.
 Take a picture of that beauty.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.245
           Hi, guys.
         BEN: How you doing?

13:34.247 --> 13:35.146
          How are you?
      BEN: We're gonna check
      in for the Hooters.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.316
           DARRIN: Oh... Wow.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.517
           Beautiful.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.386
    BEN: Kidding me? No way.

13:41.388 --> 13:43.822
        Dude, this place
        is ridiculous.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.056
     There's a pool table?

13:45.058 --> 13:45.857
 DARRIN: There's a pool table!

13:47.394 --> 13:48.193
   DARRIN: Reid,
   what are you doing, dude?

13:48.195 --> 13:50.062
      REID: Check it out.

13:50.063 --> 13:51.930
 This is what I was telling you
 about. It's JANET airlines.

13:51.932 --> 13:54.265
 You guys kidding me right now?
 We're in heaven.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.568
 BEN: Going to look at boobs.
 What are you doing, weirdo?

13:56.570 --> 13:58.469
     REID: Dude, check out
     this thermal feature
     on the camera.

13:58.471 --> 13:59.871
               BEN: Let me see.
 REID: See, it's picking up
 your heat.

13:59.873 --> 14:01.005
          BEN: Crazy.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.240
      REID: I got an idea.

14:02.242 --> 14:04.609
       Let me know if
       it picks this up.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.377
        DARRIN: Oh, God!

14:06.379 --> 14:07.879
    REID: This is not gonna
    be pretty.

14:07.881 --> 14:09.347
     BEN: Now look.
 (ALL LAUGHS)

14:09.349 --> 14:11.015
    DARRIN: That looks like
    boob prints!

14:11.017 --> 14:12.917
 BEN: Those are my blueprints!

14:12.919 --> 14:15.119
       BEN: Seamless
       Gentlemen's Club.

14:15.121 --> 14:16.020
            DARRIN: We good?

14:17.290 --> 14:18.122
      Can't see anything.

14:22.596 --> 14:25.029
    DARRIN: Dude, move.
    You're blocking my view.

14:25.031 --> 14:25.530
       REID: Let's go in
       the private room.

14:26.233 --> 14:28.600
      Nice. Night vision.

14:28.602 --> 14:31.169
      BEN: Better get some
      ladies in here soon.

14:31.171 --> 14:32.136
          I'm gonna be doing
          this the entire time.

14:32.138 --> 14:33.371
        They coming in?
             REID: Yeah.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.073
   They better come in soon.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.174
      WOMAN: Hey.
      Ready for some fun?

14:36.176 --> 14:37.876
      REID: Hello, hello.

14:37.878 --> 14:39.510
  BEN: Yeah, I think
  he needs a lap dance first.

14:39.512 --> 14:40.511
     DARRIN: That guy needs
     a little bit first.

14:40.513 --> 14:42.180
           This guy?

14:42.182 --> 14:44.582
   BEN: Do these guys first.
   I'll go after.

14:44.584 --> 14:47.652
    All right, all right.
    I'm not gonna complain.
    That's fine.

14:47.654 --> 14:50.054
     You know,
     I'm happy regardless.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.056
    REID: You are
    a gentleman and a saint.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.358
 You are a gentleman.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.425
        And a very good friend.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.295
 DARRIN: Hope you have
 a good view over there, Reid.

14:57.297 --> 15:00.098
   REID: I am looking at it.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.033
   Looking and experiencing
   are two different things.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.555
   BEN: See, Reid, it's a...

15:06.556 --> 15:08.907
         I don't know, but that
         was the greatest
         moment of my life.

15:08.909 --> 15:10.475
 Do you know how much
 trouble we could have
 gotten in for this?

15:10.477 --> 15:12.010
 To Vegas.
        To Vegas.

15:12.012 --> 15:14.178
 To best friends.
 To the trip of our lives.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.584
   REID: Rise and shine. Ben.

15:21.988 --> 15:23.288
              Hey.

15:23.290 --> 15:24.322
           BEN: What?

15:24.324 --> 15:25.490
            Get up.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.392
      What are you doing?

15:27.394 --> 15:29.093
      REID: Oh, man,
      you look beautiful.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.095
     Why are you recording
     me right now?

15:31.097 --> 15:33.197
    BEN: Look at all the fun
    we could be having
    walking down the strip,

15:33.199 --> 15:34.632
      drinking some beers.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.935
 She's there. She's texting me.

15:37.337 --> 15:38.703
 She's not crazy.

15:38.705 --> 15:40.138
     How do you know that, man?

15:40.140 --> 15:41.706
 'Cause I've talked to her.

15:41.708 --> 15:44.208
    BEN: We have no idea
    who we just sent
    our best friend to meet.

15:44.210 --> 15:45.510
         DARRIN: Let's hope she
         can help us, right?

15:45.512 --> 15:46.511
 BEN: Yeah, what if this is
 a setup or something?

15:48.515 --> 15:51.215
 Does he know
 what she looks like?
 How is he gonna...

15:51.217 --> 15:53.952
          DARRIN: I don't know.
          Oh, wait, that's her.
          Shaking hands.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.320
 BEN: Have you zoomed in?
             DARRIN: Yeah.

15:55.321 --> 15:56.687
 What does she look like?
        She doesn't look crazy.

15:56.690 --> 15:58.589
 Does she look crazy?
 Are her eyes glowing?

15:58.591 --> 16:00.959
    No, she doesn't look crazy.
    She looks normal.

16:00.961 --> 16:03.428
 Well, hopefully,
 she's not legit or
 he freaks her out.

16:03.430 --> 16:04.362
 And then we can go home.

16:04.364 --> 16:05.697
                     Right.

16:05.699 --> 16:08.466
 He's pointing at us.
 Should we wave?

16:08.468 --> 16:10.735
        She has something.
        She gave him something.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.370
            She gave him papers
            or something.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.238
        Yeah, he's bringing her
        out here.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.307
           Okay, dude, just act
           normal, all right?
           Don't be a dick.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.676
 It's gonna be really
 hard not to be a dick.

16:18.678 --> 16:20.495
    He's bringing her out here.

16:20.496 --> 16:22.313
 She's looking all sketchy.
 They both look real sketchy.

16:22.315 --> 16:23.514
 So this is Jelena.

16:23.516 --> 16:24.549
 What's your name?
           Jelena.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.517
 Jelena?
                DARRIN: Darrin.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.219
        Hi, I'm Jelena.
              Nice to meet you.

16:28.221 --> 16:29.687
       Good to meet you.
       All right, guys.
       Uh, follow me.

16:29.689 --> 16:32.156
             Okay.
 Just like that?

16:32.158 --> 16:33.257
       DARRIN: She's not shady.
       Is she, Reid?
              REID: Yup.

16:34.728 --> 16:38.162
 BEN: Well, apparently,
 we're going into storage.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.764
 'Cause nothing good happens
 at a storage facility.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.499
 Case in point,
 have you ever seen
 <i> Silence of the Lambs?</i>

16:41.501 --> 16:42.600
   REID: It's one girl, okay?

16:42.602 --> 16:43.534
 BEN: She could
 very easily kill us.

16:43.536 --> 16:44.569
 And store our bodies.

16:44.571 --> 16:46.170
 REID: We can take her.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.271
  Well, I know if a gun
  gets pulled out, I'm running.

16:50.043 --> 16:51.576
     He became really paranoid.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.745
     He kept talking about how
     our phones were tapped

16:53.747 --> 16:55.346
        and how there were
        people following him

16:55.348 --> 16:57.515
       and all kinds of
       crazy stuff like that.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.585
         And he made me promise
         that if anything were
         to happen to him,

17:00.587 --> 17:03.654
     I would move all his stuff
     to a storage facility.

17:03.656 --> 17:06.223
              Somewhere secret
              that no one would
              be able to find.

17:06.226 --> 17:09.027
      He was extremely adamant
      that I did it right away.

17:09.029 --> 17:12.497
 So the night that he died,
 I brought his stuff over here.

17:12.499 --> 17:15.633
     And, it's crazy,
     literally within 24 hours,
     our house was raided.

17:16.469 --> 17:17.734
         They want what's here.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.384
 He was fired for asking
 too many questions.

17:35.655 --> 17:39.557
 I was the one that found
 my dad in the garage
 that night.

17:41.227 --> 17:43.161
         Look at this.

17:43.163 --> 17:44.662
 They ruled it as a suicide.
 He would have never
 killed himself.

17:44.664 --> 17:45.563
    REID: This whole thing's
    been redacted.

17:45.565 --> 17:46.831
        JELENA: I know.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.266
          BEN: Your father?
 JELENA: Yeah.

17:50.370 --> 17:52.804
    Looks like a nice guy.
  Mmm-hmm.

17:52.806 --> 17:54.705
 Yeah, he was a really
 good guy. (SNIFFS)

17:56.543 --> 17:59.377
 Holy shit! This is a timeline
 of all the employees.

17:59.379 --> 18:00.645
 This is incredible.

18:00.647 --> 18:02.346
 Thousands of people's
 medical records.

18:03.483 --> 18:05.149
 Malignant prostate?

18:05.151 --> 18:06.484
 I don't know why
 he'd have that.

18:06.486 --> 18:07.618
           JELENA: Come here.
             REID: What?

18:07.620 --> 18:11.722
    Yeah, these are my dad's
    maps of the base.

18:11.724 --> 18:13.091
        REID: Seriously?

18:16.096 --> 18:18.162
 JELENA: Of course, he wasn't
 allowed into all the buildings

18:18.164 --> 18:20.131
   but this is what he's got.

18:20.133 --> 18:22.233
    Everything above
    ground is just a front.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.168
   The real base is
   a mile underground in S4.

18:24.170 --> 18:25.736
    He wasn't allowed in there.

18:25.738 --> 18:28.706
 REID: Marked different
 staircases and elevators.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.341
 That could be how
 you get underground.

18:30.343 --> 18:32.076
 It would be real helpful
 when we get to the base.

18:32.077 --> 18:33.810
     JELENA: Even if you make
     it on the base, this isn't
     going to help you.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.613
         You need fingerprints.
         You need a badge.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.582
         They have access codes
         that change every day.

18:37.583 --> 18:39.550
 Well, your dad
 didn't have access to it,
 so he obviously snuck in.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.119
             JELENA: Yeah,
             and my dad's dead.

18:41.121 --> 18:42.420
    BEN: You really want to
    go through with this?

18:42.422 --> 18:43.387
 REID: Yeah, I don't have
 a choice.

18:45.358 --> 18:47.225
 Looks like your dad
 was able to get into S4

18:47.227 --> 18:49.160
 but just not, sort of,
 parts...

18:49.162 --> 18:50.895
             Well, he was
             following someone.

18:50.897 --> 18:54.332
        This guy, I know I have
        his picture in here
        somewhere,

18:54.334 --> 18:56.834
             who did have
             full S4 clearance.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.870
     And I know that my dad
     was following him.

19:02.208 --> 19:03.741
          There we go. The guy.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.610
         I don't know his name.

19:05.612 --> 19:06.811
           I just know
           that that's the guy
           my dad was following

19:06.813 --> 19:08.630
              and the reason
              why he got fired.

19:08.631 --> 19:10.448
     REID: Well, if he does
     still work there,
     I think we could find him.

19:10.450 --> 19:11.916
            He probably lives
            in or around Vegas.

19:14.687 --> 19:17.421
 Reid, if this is
 for real, this is what
 got her father killed.

19:20.727 --> 19:22.426
                      Yeah.

19:22.428 --> 19:23.494
 REID: We'll be careful.

19:24.264 --> 19:25.363
    Hi. Norio?

19:25.365 --> 19:26.864
              Yes.

19:26.866 --> 19:28.766
 So let's say we get to the top
 of the ridge here,

19:28.768 --> 19:30.301
     say I want to do more
     than just look at it.

19:30.303 --> 19:32.470
       Say I want to
       get down into S4.

19:32.472 --> 19:37.808
 Get out of the car
 and just keep walking
 along this boundary fence.

19:37.810 --> 19:41.345
 Most of the heat sensors
 and motion detectors

19:41.347 --> 19:44.348
 are along this
 Groom Lake dirt road.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.750
      REID: There are no motion
      sensors over here?

19:45.752 --> 19:47.818
 NORIO: There are very little.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.620
         Rattlesnakes?

19:49.622 --> 19:50.755
 Yes, there's rattlesnakes
 all over.

19:50.757 --> 19:51.856
        S4 is down here, right?

19:51.858 --> 19:53.257
 S4 is down here.

19:53.259 --> 19:55.793
 Can we get over that mountain?

19:55.795 --> 19:59.197
 As long as you're
 not detected.

19:59.199 --> 20:00.398
            The JANET airlines.
         The terminal.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.900
 737 outbound jets right there.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.302
   The one with the red stripe?

20:04.304 --> 20:05.903
          NORIO: Yes.

20:05.905 --> 20:07.939
    In fact, you can see
    the parking lot over there.

20:09.876 --> 20:10.942
     REID: Darrin, I think
     this is his flight.

20:10.944 --> 20:12.510
    DARRIN: How do you know?

20:12.512 --> 20:14.378
    REID: The tail numbers.
    We gotta go.

20:14.380 --> 20:14.912
      DARRIN: Right now?
          REID: Yeah.

20:16.516 --> 20:18.416
           We got to get there
           before they deplane.

20:18.418 --> 20:19.450
 DARRIN: I'm going as fast
 as possible, man.

20:22.322 --> 20:22.987
    Take a right, take a right.

20:26.459 --> 20:27.692
 Am I going in there
 or what am I doing?

20:27.694 --> 20:29.794
                        Okay...
 What?

20:29.796 --> 20:31.395
        This is it.
        This is JANET terminal.
 This is JANET?

20:31.397 --> 20:33.331
 There's a lot of cars.

20:33.333 --> 20:34.699
  The dude could be anywhere.

20:36.903 --> 20:39.837
 So they fly the employees
 in and out of this base
 every day?

20:39.839 --> 20:40.938
                           Yup.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.006
  Here?

20:42.008 --> 20:43.474
                Yup, every day.

20:43.476 --> 20:45.409
 Who's JANET?

20:45.411 --> 20:47.812
          Uh, it stands for
          Just Another
          Nonexistent Terminal.

20:47.814 --> 20:49.013
              That's the rumor.

20:49.015 --> 20:50.748
 It's a stupid rumor.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.483
 DARRIN: I think I see him.
          REID: Can you see him
          on there?

20:52.485 --> 20:54.485
      DARRIN: Yeah, yeah.
      I'm zooming in.

20:54.486 --> 20:56.486
 White hair, glasses,
 getting in a small black car.

20:56.489 --> 20:58.589
     DARRIN: Oh, shit.
     Reid, Reid, it's him.

20:58.591 --> 20:59.523
      DARRIN: Right there,
      right there.
              REID: Follow him.

20:59.525 --> 21:00.958
   BEN: Okay.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.027

         a little space though.

        Put it in drive.
        Here we go, here we go.

21:04.297 --> 21:05.830
        All right, go.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.265
 So I'm just
 following this guy?
                          Yeah.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.634
        Can you zoom in on him?

21:09.636 --> 21:11.435
 DARRIN: Yeah. It's him, dude.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.004
  It's definitely him.
  I can see him in his mirror.

21:13.006 --> 21:15.640
    He's wearing black glasses.
    White hair.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.308
       He's the exact guy
       in the picture.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.278
 BEN: So do you have
 a plan though?

21:20.280 --> 21:22.013
             I got a few ideas.

21:22.015 --> 21:24.682
 Would you like to share
 them or are we keeping
 that to ourselves?

21:24.684 --> 21:26.350
      Okay.

21:26.352 --> 21:27.752
 What if he's a janitor?

21:27.754 --> 21:29.287
         He's got to be
         a high-level employee.

21:29.289 --> 21:30.554
 What, are you just gonna
 hit him over the head?

21:30.556 --> 21:31.989
          Dude, don't lose him.
 I'm not losing him.

21:31.991 --> 21:34.925
         Speed up a little bit.

21:34.927 --> 21:36.994
    DARRIN: What if that guy
    knew that Jelena's dad
    was following him?

21:36.996 --> 21:39.530
 What if this is the reason
 Jelena's dad was killed?

21:39.532 --> 21:41.532
 I suddenly don't
 like this idea anymore.

21:41.534 --> 21:42.833
      You're doing a great job.
 Thank you.

21:42.835 --> 21:44.335

        done this before.

 take up a new career.

       All right, stay back,
       stay back. Let some cars
       get between.

22:04.991 --> 22:07.391
           Stay a good, like,
           50 yards behind him.

22:07.393 --> 22:08.626
 More than 50.

                    Whoa, whoa.

22:14.600 --> 22:15.766
 You want me to
 just drive past him?

22:15.768 --> 22:16.600
                Drive past him.
                Drive past him.

          and turn around.

 this stakeout?

22:26.112 --> 22:27.878
                       We wait.
 For how long?

22:27.880 --> 22:29.113
          We gotta stick around
          to see if he leaves.

 Great.

22:30.717 --> 22:32.717

 this stakeout very well.

 If he doesn't leave, plan B?

           the plan here, Reid?

 Why would you not tell me
 you have something?

     eat the whole fucking bag.

 that we were making out

30:42.174 --> 30:44.508
 I mean, you just
 fuckin' broke into
 someone's house.

30:44.510 --> 30:47.044
 No. That was home invasion,
 breaking and entering,
 robbery...

      DARRIN: We got what
      we came for.

30:48.080 --> 30:49.246
            They didn't see us.
             DARRIN: Yeah.

 He works for the government.

30:50.616 --> 30:52.115
           REID: Okay. But they
           didn't see us.

30:52.117 --> 30:54.952
 It's 10, 15 years in jail.
 What if they woke up?

30:54.954 --> 30:56.253
       Look, they didn't see...
 They had a kid!

            We're totally fine.

 What if one of the neighbors
 saw my license plate?

30:58.958 --> 31:00.490
                No one saw you.
 How do you know that?

31:00.492 --> 31:02.125
                   They didn't.

              They didn't, man.

 talk him out of it, man.

 if you didn't want to do this?

 I didn't think it was
 actually gonna get
 this far, man.

     we spent three months

      back out? Come on.

 for the consequences?

     24 hours a day.

37:37.556 --> 37:40.023
 you may have
 your heat sensors.

 If you can defeat this unit
 out here on public land,

37:44.463 --> 37:46.863
 you'd probably
 be able to defeat
 what they have inside.

 over there.
        GLENN: That's them.

37:48.633 --> 37:50.400

        GLENN: Those are
        the camo dudes.

37:50.402 --> 37:52.702
  BEN: I'm not gonna
  get a sniper bullet
  in my head right now, am I?

37:52.704 --> 37:54.537
  Just pull over on to the side
  of the road, right here.

37:54.539 --> 37:55.538
     Just pull up to that area.

37:56.842 --> 37:58.508
 BEN: Is there a guy there?
 Can you see?

37:58.510 --> 38:00.644
         GLENN: You got a, uh,
         telephoto on that?

38:00.646 --> 38:01.745
    REID: Yeah, I zoomed in
    on him.

38:01.747 --> 38:03.230

             if there's...

38:03.231 --> 38:04.714

      the binoculars on us
      right now.

38:04.716 --> 38:06.716
      GLENN: Really?
      Two guys, right?
              REID: Yep.

38:06.718 --> 38:08.852
 GLENN: Up there in that ridge,
 there are two tripods.

38:08.854 --> 38:10.553
       BEN: There's one.

38:10.555 --> 38:11.721
      REID: One of them is
      pointing toward us.

38:11.723 --> 38:13.823
    BEN: And there's
    another one right there.

38:13.824 --> 38:15.924
    GLENN: The other one is
    pointing toward the road
    we just came down.

38:15.927 --> 38:18.628
  So, if you have a vehicle,
  there's no real sneaking in.

38:18.630 --> 38:19.663

 of the car right now?

38:19.665 --> 38:21.364

      camo dudes up here.

 human being ever, right now?

 Everything you've ever wanted.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.707
    This is almost as exciting.

38:30.709 --> 38:32.325
             Yeah.
      This could be
      used against you...

   I'd be at a pool
   in Vegas right now.

 DARRIN: We made it
 to the border.

38:35.047 --> 38:37.847

 another one.

  So, I'm really just out here.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.699
       Since I was close,
       I decided I should

38:55.701 --> 38:57.534
     come by and do
     the touristy thing...

38:57.536 --> 38:58.735

38:58.737 --> 38:59.736
    Okay. All right. Thanks.

  with no license plates.
  Yeah, you're a tourist. Sure.

 a security guard, huh?

39:07.446 --> 39:08.878

         anything stupid, okay?

39:08.880 --> 39:09.746
       You got it.
       Thank you, Glenn.

      I can taste it.

 Let's go talk to
 this guy. Come on.

     come out here!

 Let's go.

 doing here?

 Yeah. What are you doing here?

40:32.564 --> 40:33.830
 We gotta get moving.
 Let's go.

40:33.832 --> 40:35.598
      I'm coming with you guys.
        DARRIN: What?

40:35.600 --> 40:37.567
 JELENA: I asked the guy
 up front.
             BEN: Fuck.

40:37.569 --> 40:39.569
    They've got ammonia sensors
    all over the base,

40:39.571 --> 40:41.538
  so these neomycin pills
  will mask our ammonia levels.

40:41.540 --> 40:43.173
 JELENA: Okay.
              Darrin and I have
              been taking them

40:43.174 --> 40:44.807
         for a few days now,
         so we're gonna have
         to triple your dosage.

40:44.810 --> 40:46.609
 Well, are they
 gonna work?

40:46.611 --> 40:48.511
          Hopefully. Might have
          to test your levels
          before we leave.

           Keep moving.
           We have a lot to do.

40:50.749 --> 40:51.981

40:52.784 --> 40:54.918

40:54.920 --> 40:56.553
      Say something, man.
      You shouldn't...

40:56.555 --> 40:58.054
      DARRIN: I don't know
      what that is.

40:58.056 --> 41:00.590
 Just tell him that
 it's not okay with you, dude.

41:03.061 --> 41:04.093

       bring her with us.

41:04.095 --> 41:06.062
       What?

41:06.064 --> 41:08.164

 talking about?

41:11.068 --> 41:13.001
 She's not gonna get us caught,
 we have the Freon suit.

41:13.004 --> 41:15.505
     So what? That's not a good
     enough reason, okay?

41:15.507 --> 41:17.674
 Dude, we can't tell her no,
 okay? She's helped us out,

41:17.676 --> 41:19.742
 she gave us all the stuff,
 she gave us the maps.

41:19.744 --> 41:21.644
       Okay. Well,
       the ammonia pills, okay?

41:21.646 --> 41:23.580
              The level's gonna
              be way too high.

41:23.582 --> 41:25.882
 I know, all right?
 We'll test her before we go,

41:25.884 --> 41:26.616
 if it doesn't test out,
 we won't bring her.

41:26.618 --> 41:27.984
                 Okay.

41:27.986 --> 41:30.220

              trusting you guys

                my dad left me.

         to be here

       me here.

 help us.

   after, like, 30 seconds.

42:13.732 --> 42:15.098
  JELENA: What does that mean?

42:15.100 --> 42:16.933
     It means we have
     to detect the signal,

42:16.935 --> 42:20.270
 jam it, and then disable it
 before it changes frequencies.

  we got off your

 all around the base,

43:32.911 --> 43:35.211
 and they pick up
 your body heat.

 do is, we're gonna
 pump Freon through this suit.

     Fit in right here,
     and that'll mask
     our body temperature.

   Darrin, turn on the Freon
   and put on the thermal?

43:41.386 --> 43:42.285

 All right.

     You can see the Freon
     coming through.

   down, it's kinda cool.

 it's escaping
 through your head, so.
