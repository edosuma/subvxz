00:01.306 --> 00:03.934
<i>(Teyla) Previously on Stargate Atlantis...</i>

00:04.100 --> 00:06.019
- It's heading here.
- What's it doing?

00:06.186 --> 00:09.147
It's scanning us.

00:09.314 --> 00:13.652
The dart sent a transmission into space
and self-destructed before we got to it.

00:13.818 --> 00:16.404
- We scanned the area...
- What are those?

00:16.571 --> 00:19.032
- Wraith hive ships.
- Where are they headed?

00:19.199 --> 00:24.621
If they maintain direction and speed,
they'll be over our planet in two weeks.

00:31.127 --> 00:33.505
We knew they were coming.
Now we know when.

00:33.672 --> 00:35.757
- That's something.
- That's something?

00:35.924 --> 00:40.554
It means there's still time, Rodney.
There's no reason to panic... yet.

00:40.720 --> 00:43.932
- Where there is time, there is hope.
- So, recommendations?

00:44.099 --> 00:46.643
- Other than panic?
- Other than panic, yes.

00:47.644 --> 00:51.731
I realise this might not be cool,
but we should consider M7G-677.

00:52.774 --> 00:57.487
- As a possible evacuation site?
- No. I'm suggesting we take their ZPM.

00:57.654 --> 01:02.701
Their only protection from the Wraith?
A planet populated mostly by children?

01:02.868 --> 01:04.953
He raises a valid point.

01:05.120 --> 01:08.623
The ZPM is nearly depleted,
but it could be of some use to us.

01:08.790 --> 01:11.626
You asked for suggestions.
It's a matter of survival.

01:11.793 --> 01:15.922
I see. Well, we're not quite there yet,

01:16.089 --> 01:19.134
and as long as I'm in charge
we will never be there.

01:19.301 --> 01:24.598
I agree. If this is to be our end, it is best
we face it with both dignity and honour.

01:24.764 --> 01:28.185
- I have an idea... in addition to panic.
- Let's hear it.

01:28.351 --> 01:32.147
It's a long shot,
but I think it's most likely worth the effort.

01:32.314 --> 01:35.025
- It'll mostly be my effort, so...
- What is it?

01:35.192 --> 01:38.195
We can send a message to Earth
through the Stargate.

01:38.361 --> 01:41.031
- Excuse me?
- Do we have enough power?

01:41.198 --> 01:44.201
Not to send a person.
We couldn't maintain the wormhole.

01:44.367 --> 01:47.662
If we tied together
all our power-generating capabilities,

01:47.829 --> 01:52.417
<i>we might be able to establish a wormhole
long enough to send a message.</i>

01:52.584 --> 01:57.964
- How much time are we talking about?
- Approximately 1.3 seconds, give or take.

01:58.131 --> 02:00.717
- That's not much time.
- Time to say SOS.

02:00.884 --> 02:06.431
It's enough time to send a message in
the form of a high-compression data burst.

02:06.598 --> 02:09.935
I helped refine the encoding
for the US air force.

02:10.101 --> 02:13.063
Colonel Carter can decipher it
on the other side.

02:13.230 --> 02:16.149
- You're suggesting this now?
- It probably won't work

02:16.316 --> 02:18.693
and could overload
our naqahdah generators.

02:18.860 --> 02:23.114
Well, then, we can't take the risk.
No power, we won't have a chance in hell.

02:23.281 --> 02:28.537
There are three Wraith hive ships on the
way. This calls for desperate measures.

02:28.703 --> 02:32.249
Besides, I've been working out
ways of minimising the risk.

02:33.458 --> 02:37.504
Assuming it's possible,
how much information could we send?

02:37.671 --> 02:43.718
Everything. Mission reports
from all the senior staff, stuff on Atlantis...

02:43.885 --> 02:46.847
- All that. One second?
- 1.3.

02:47.013 --> 02:51.101
If I finesse the compression ratios,
you'll be looking for things to add.

02:56.857 --> 02:59.025
- Do it.
- Doing it.

03:13.874 --> 03:18.336
Elizabeth, you realise that if Stargate
Command was able to send help...

03:18.503 --> 03:20.589
I know. They would have.

03:20.755 --> 03:25.385
But we must report what we've learned
here, about Atlantis, about the Ancients.

03:25.552 --> 03:28.430
- The Wraith.
- Exactly. We have to warn Earth.

03:28.597 --> 03:33.185
- Even if it's the last thing we do?
- Especially if it's the last thing we do.

04:39.835 --> 04:42.420
They don't seem threatening
as dots on a screen.

04:42.587 --> 04:46.216
We need to do recon
and see what we're up against first-hand.

04:46.383 --> 04:48.426
- How?
- I've tracked their progress.

04:48.593 --> 04:52.305
The Wraith ships
go in and out of hyperspace periodically,

04:52.472 --> 04:54.683
because their technology is limited...

04:54.850 --> 05:00.397
- Or they're stopping to feed along the way.
- The point is, the pattern is predictable.

05:00.564 --> 05:03.942
I can guess with some certainty
that they'll be making stops

05:04.109 --> 05:07.112
here, here, and here.

05:07.279 --> 05:11.283
The ships are light years away. How
will you reach them by puddle jumper?

05:11.449 --> 05:15.203
We take a route where Zelenka thinks
they'll drop out of hyperspace

05:15.370 --> 05:17.455
and we watch them pass by.

05:17.622 --> 05:20.250
- That's good.
- You know, I have my moments.

05:20.417 --> 05:23.378
Teyla and I were just deciding
which planet to go to.

05:23.545 --> 05:25.797
I know the people of this world.

05:25.964 --> 05:29.926
Their Stargate is in the open
and so accessible by ship.

05:30.093 --> 05:33.763
You can remain undetected by the Wraith
as they go by your position?

05:33.930 --> 05:36.266
Stealth mode.
They won't know we're there.

05:36.433 --> 05:41.021
OK, go, get what intel you can, and get
back before Rodney sends his message.

05:41.188 --> 05:44.232
- I need you here.
- Won't even stop at the duty free.

06:08.548 --> 06:12.135
If you get the idea to take
the Wraith ships on yourself, Major,

06:12.302 --> 06:14.179
I am hereby ordering you not to.

06:14.346 --> 06:16.681
- Believe me, you don't have to.
- Still...

06:16.848 --> 06:21.561
Don't take on an alien armada
single-handedly. Understood.

06:38.328 --> 06:41.248
Father, Teyla's here!

06:51.842 --> 06:55.345
- Teyla.
- Orin. It has been many days.

06:55.512 --> 06:59.224
Too many. Look at you.
You're so different.

06:59.391 --> 07:03.603
Much has changed since my last visit.

07:03.770 --> 07:08.108
- This is Major John Sheppard... and Orin.
- Pleased to meet you, uh...

07:09.651 --> 07:13.780
- The harvest is still months away.
- Yes, I know.

07:13.947 --> 07:17.200
We have not come to trade,
but to deliver a warning.

07:18.076 --> 07:20.620
We believe the Wraith
may be on their way.

07:21.413 --> 07:24.040
We don't know that,
but we're about to find out.

07:24.207 --> 07:27.419
Yes.
It seems they're awakening everywhere.

07:27.586 --> 07:30.839
Tell your people to take precautions
in case they do come.

07:31.006 --> 07:34.718
I will, but you know as well as I do, Teyla,

07:34.885 --> 07:37.804
that the Wraith will track us down
wherever we go.

07:37.971 --> 07:41.516
- There will be no escape.
- What about through the Stargate?

07:41.683 --> 07:46.188
The cullings are taking place
on many worlds. None are safe.

07:46.354 --> 07:48.398
Even we have taken in refugees.

07:49.316 --> 07:51.776
If they do come, stay far from the Stargate.

07:51.943 --> 07:56.448
Take your family to the far tree line there
and wait for us.

07:56.615 --> 07:59.743
- Teyla.
- One family, Major. That is all I ask.

08:04.539 --> 08:09.836
- I'm sorry, Orin, I can't make that promise.
- It will be the very least we can do.

08:13.715 --> 08:16.468
<i>- If there's time.
- (Teyla) Then we must hurry.</i>

08:25.352 --> 08:28.104
Children, we must prepare.

08:28.271 --> 08:31.525
We have our city specs, mission reports

08:31.691 --> 08:35.153
and tactical assessments all ready to go.
What else?

08:35.320 --> 08:39.323
I've included data we've been able
to decipher from the Ancient database.

08:39.491 --> 08:42.409
Really? That is incredible.

08:42.577 --> 08:47.332
- My algorithm is extraordinarily efficient.
- Oh, please.

08:47.499 --> 08:50.919
It must be in order to fit all that data
into 1.3 seconds.

08:51.086 --> 08:53.338
.3 seconds, actually.

08:53.505 --> 08:57.843
- We have a whole extra second to fill?
- Mm. A whole extra one, yes.

09:02.722 --> 09:05.392
Is it enough
to include personal messages?

09:05.559 --> 09:11.523
Uh... sure. I mean, several hours of video.
Much more if it was strictly audio.

09:11.690 --> 09:14.985
I think it'd do wonders for morale.
Especially now.

09:15.152 --> 09:17.988
I could tell my grandma
what I've been up to.

09:18.155 --> 09:20.532
If your grandmother
had security clearance.

09:20.699 --> 09:24.494
But for now you can tell her
that you're well and that you miss her.

09:24.661 --> 09:28.832
This is all very charming,
but I have work to do. Shouldn't I, um...?

09:28.999 --> 09:32.169
Lieutenant,
maybe you'd like to handle this.

09:32.335 --> 09:36.298
Give everybody a few minutes
to send a message to their loved ones.

09:36.465 --> 09:39.426
- I'd love to, ma'am.
- Off you go.

09:42.929 --> 09:46.183
When Zelenka and I tie
Jumper Four's engines into the grid,

09:46.349 --> 09:49.478
- we'll be able to do a low-power dry run.
- Good.

09:49.644 --> 09:51.521
- Rodney?
- Mm?

09:51.688 --> 09:54.649
- You don't want to send a message?
- You know what?

09:54.816 --> 09:58.278
Maybe with all my spare time,
I'll record a message myself.

09:58.445 --> 10:01.448
- You?
- Yes.

10:02.991 --> 10:05.911
Good, good.

10:12.375 --> 10:15.128
This wasn't supposed to be
a rescue mission.

10:15.295 --> 10:19.674
- Orin was a good friend of my father.
- I agreed to warn him.

10:19.841 --> 10:24.971
If someone close to your family, a dear
friend, was in danger from the Wraith,

10:25.138 --> 10:29.976
- would you have not done the same?
- Not if it jeopardised the mission.

10:30.143 --> 10:33.396
So we give up that
which makes us different from the Wraith?

10:33.563 --> 10:40.445
I agreed to stop and pick him up if there
was time, but only if there was time.

10:40.612 --> 10:43.406
I'd like to be saving everyone
in the damn galaxy.

10:43.573 --> 10:47.953
- It's just one man and his children.
- I agreed to help if there was time.

10:50.205 --> 10:52.666
You can only fight the battles you can win.

10:58.588 --> 11:00.841
<i>(Sheppard) Whoa.</i>

11:33.665 --> 11:36.710
Let me get this thing turned around.

11:42.757 --> 11:45.677
They're heading for the planet.

11:50.515 --> 11:53.059
<i>(Ford) OK, recording. Plenty of battery.</i>

11:53.226 --> 11:57.022
So why am I not seeing anything?
Oh... stupid.

12:10.202 --> 12:12.078
OK.

12:12.245 --> 12:15.248
Hi, Grandma, Grandpa.

12:15.415 --> 12:18.168
It's me, Aiden... obviously.

12:18.335 --> 12:22.714
I'm talking to you
from a place far, far from home.

12:22.881 --> 12:26.218
I'm good, though.
You don't have to worry.

12:26.384 --> 12:30.263
Life here is... pretty routine.

12:40.482 --> 12:44.736
I'm hoping that I'll be able
to get home sometime soon,

12:44.903 --> 12:48.323
but, you know,
if... if I'm stuck here a while,

12:49.699 --> 12:52.118
I want you to know that I'm good.

12:52.285 --> 12:56.081
I'm doing things...
I'm seeing things I never thought I'd see.

13:11.304 --> 13:14.599
I wish I could tell you all about it.
Who knows?

13:14.766 --> 13:17.394
One day, maybe, I'll be able to,

13:17.561 --> 13:21.898
but I want you both to know...
that you're right here.

13:23.608 --> 13:26.319
Always. All the time.

13:31.658 --> 13:34.786
Even flying full out,
we're just ahead of the armada.

13:34.953 --> 13:38.331
- I can't risk putting down for Orin.
- I see.

13:40.333 --> 13:45.046
I'm gonna take us out of stealth mode
for the pass-through. Dial the gate.

13:48.008 --> 13:50.886
Hang on. Incoming wormhole.

13:57.642 --> 14:02.355
The Wraith dial in to prevent victims from
using the Stargate as a means of escape.

14:02.522 --> 14:04.191
So we're stuck here.

14:04.357 --> 14:07.986
Once the ship is rendered invisible again,
we will be safe.

14:08.153 --> 14:11.531
I need to get the intel
about the Wraith fleet to Atlantis.

14:11.698 --> 14:15.535
They will keep dialling in through the night
at the very least,

14:15.702 --> 14:19.539
but if we wait where
I told Orin and his family to meet us...

14:19.706 --> 14:22.167
That's where I'm headed.

14:30.509 --> 14:32.594
I'm not very good at this.

14:32.761 --> 14:35.597
<i>(Ford) The only people to see it
will be your family.</i>

14:35.764 --> 14:40.018
- Aye, and you and the US military.
- Well, give it a shot.

14:40.185 --> 14:43.688
- What shall I say?
- Uh... Uh...

14:43.855 --> 14:47.859
- "I miss you. I wish you were here."
- I wish who was here?

14:48.026 --> 14:51.196
- Who do you wish was here?
- Nobody. I wish I wasn't!

14:51.363 --> 14:53.448
I've got a lot of people to get to.

14:53.615 --> 14:59.621
<i>(sighs) All right, er...
I suppose I could say hello to my mother.</i>

14:59.788 --> 15:03.041
Good. There you go. All right, you ready?

15:03.208 --> 15:06.294
<i>- (clears throat)
- OK, go.</i>

15:06.461 --> 15:10.465
Hello, Mum.
I hope this message finds you well.

15:11.466 --> 15:14.302
I trust your petunias
are in full bloom by now.

15:14.469 --> 15:17.013
I hope you're keeping up
with that ointment.

15:17.180 --> 15:22.394
If you've adhered to the regime,
the fungus should have cleared up by now.

15:22.561 --> 15:25.105
- What's wrong?
- Dude, fungus?

15:25.272 --> 15:28.483
On her toenails.
You said no one would watch this.

15:28.650 --> 15:31.570
- Yeah, but fungus?
- What, then, shall I talk about?

15:31.736 --> 15:35.574
- It's your mother. Tell her you love her.
- I can't. I get emotional.

15:35.740 --> 15:39.578
- So?
- She's very delicate, my mother.

15:39.744 --> 15:43.748
As sweet a soul as you'll ever meet,
as pure as the driven snow.

15:43.915 --> 15:46.793
If I get upset, she'll get upset.
I can't have that.

15:46.960 --> 15:51.298
We're not live. If you don't like
what we put on tape, we can do it again.

15:51.465 --> 15:54.092
- We can?
- Sure.

15:54.259 --> 15:58.763
Oh. Well, I suppose I could do that, then.

15:58.930 --> 16:01.016
All right.

16:01.183 --> 16:03.810
Here we go.

16:03.977 --> 16:06.688
Um... Mum...

16:11.610 --> 16:13.695
I miss you terribly.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.076
I can't do this!

16:32.798 --> 16:35.425
Come on, Orin, show up.

16:38.970 --> 16:40.430
What?

16:40.597 --> 16:43.099
Not long ago,
you would have left him behind.

16:43.266 --> 16:45.477
Well, the situation has changed.

16:49.064 --> 16:52.609
Lieutenant Ford suggested
we steal from a community of children.

16:52.776 --> 16:55.862
They have a ZPM
and we can bring them back.

16:56.029 --> 16:58.198
Only to face death in Atlantis?

16:58.365 --> 17:03.245
Ford and I are military. We've spent
a lot of our lives learning how to survive.

17:03.411 --> 17:05.830
I have spent my life surviving the Wraith.

17:05.997 --> 17:09.584
Part of that training is knowing
who you can and can't save.

17:09.751 --> 17:12.002
And that decision is yours alone?

17:12.170 --> 17:17.550
I said that I'd wait for your friend
if there was time. Now there's time.

17:17.717 --> 17:22.806
- What else do you want from me?
- Too much, I fear.

17:25.724 --> 17:30.313
<i>- It's gonna be a long night.
- (whirring)</i>

17:34.609 --> 17:36.486
<i>(speaking Czech)</i>

17:36.653 --> 17:41.158
<i>Failsafe.
(continues speaking Czech)</i>

18:38.507 --> 18:42.803
<i>(Ford) You didn't say anything that
would require security clearance, did you?</i>

18:42.969 --> 18:45.305
Security clearance?

18:54.231 --> 18:58.610
- This is hard to sit and watch.
- There's nothing we can do.

18:58.777 --> 19:02.864
We could do a lot.
It would just be the last thing we ever do.

19:03.031 --> 19:06.243
We are far outnumbered
and the gate is still inaccessible.

19:07.869 --> 19:12.415
But if we save Orin and his family,
we will have done something.

19:14.376 --> 19:16.461
Something.

19:20.590 --> 19:22.467
I'm gonna miss you, kiddo.

19:22.634 --> 19:25.679
I can't wait to take you
to a basketball game

19:25.846 --> 19:30.183
and watch Kobe and Shaq
take another title home for the Lakers.

19:34.563 --> 19:36.022
That's it.

19:37.232 --> 19:40.610
- That's it?
- What else am I gonna say to a kid?

19:40.777 --> 19:43.280
- It's your brother.
- I may not see him again.

19:43.446 --> 19:46.575
- Why make it any worse?
- That's not what this is about.

19:46.741 --> 19:49.703
That's exactly what this is about.

19:51.580 --> 19:55.083
Don't sweat it. I'm happy
I got the chance to say goodbye.

19:55.250 --> 19:58.628
- Yeah, but you didn't say it.
- Not in so many words.

20:06.386 --> 20:09.055
- Lieutenant Ford.
- Ready to record your message?

20:09.222 --> 20:13.143
Already done. Actually, I took the liberty
of doing mine in private.

20:13.310 --> 20:15.854
- Now, it may require some editing.
- Editing?

20:16.021 --> 20:18.565
Yeah, I went on a bit.
I used the entire tape.

20:18.732 --> 20:21.485
- You talked for an hour?
- I found it therapeutic.

20:21.651 --> 20:24.404
I've come up with
several valuable insights,

20:24.571 --> 20:29.493
but I've only slept six hours
in the last few days, so, um...

20:29.659 --> 20:32.120
- Who's it for?
- Humanity, my sister...

20:32.287 --> 20:34.706
I don't expect you to cut it down too much.

20:34.873 --> 20:37.834
There is gold in here.
So just make sure mine's last.

20:38.001 --> 20:42.798
If the gate holds the connection,
we won't have wasted the time.

20:42.964 --> 20:46.718
- Well, I'll look forward to it.
- Well, enjoy.

20:47.886 --> 20:49.971
Gold.

20:57.020 --> 20:58.688
<i>(clears throat)</i>

20:58.855 --> 21:02.651
And in five... four... three...

21:04.861 --> 21:06.947
This is Dr Rodney McKay speaking

21:07.113 --> 21:10.158
from my base of operations
in the lost city of Atlantis,

21:10.325 --> 21:13.954
located deep within the Pegasus galaxy.

21:14.120 --> 21:18.667
I record this message
on the eve of our darkest hour.

21:18.834 --> 21:22.629
As I speak, an alien armada
of biblical proportions is on its way,

21:22.796 --> 21:28.176
bent - dare I say hell-bent, in keeping
with the metaphor - on our destruction.

21:28.343 --> 21:31.221
We will do our best
to stave off their attack,

21:31.388 --> 21:34.474
but I am afraid that defeat
is all but inevitable.

21:34.641 --> 21:41.064
I and the other members of my team
face the most horrific deaths imaginable

21:41.231 --> 21:48.238
as our very lives are... are sucked
from our chests in a... in a... horrific...

21:49.739 --> 21:52.200
OK, um...
OK, starting again, starting again.

21:52.367 --> 21:54.911
Um, Ford, just cut that, all right?

21:56.538 --> 21:58.665
What about, uh...?

22:04.838 --> 22:08.425
- What is that?
- I've never seen such a thing.

22:12.012 --> 22:14.890
- I'm gonna check it out.
- You may be discovered.

22:15.056 --> 22:17.142
- I'll make a point not to.
- Major.

22:17.309 --> 22:19.728
I just want to see whatever that is.

22:19.895 --> 22:22.647
Just stay here
until Orin and his family show up.

22:31.448 --> 22:33.783
<i>(distant shouting)</i>

22:40.874 --> 22:42.959
And in five, four, three...

22:43.126 --> 22:44.795
<i>(clears throat)</i>

22:44.961 --> 22:48.673
My friends, I'm Dr Rodney McKay
of the Atlantis expedition,

22:48.840 --> 22:52.052
and as the facts of our heroic struggle
against the Wraith

22:52.219 --> 22:55.430
and our untimely demise
are already known to you,

22:55.597 --> 23:00.060
in that light,
I'd like to pass along some final thoughts.

23:01.478 --> 23:06.483
Now, my extensive education, training
and experience in the field of astrophysics

23:06.650 --> 23:10.028
has given me a unique perspective
that few on Earth,

23:10.195 --> 23:14.157
or, well, on any other planet,
for that matter, can match.

23:14.324 --> 23:18.912
I'd like to take a few moments now
to pass along that perspective to you.

23:19.079 --> 23:23.708
I'll begin with a few observations
on a subject

23:23.875 --> 23:26.670
that is both near and dear to my heart.

23:28.255 --> 23:30.340
Leadership.

23:30.507 --> 23:34.719
Mr and Mrs Markham,
my name is Dr Elizabeth Weir,

23:34.886 --> 23:37.472
and your son
was a member of my expedition team.

23:40.100 --> 23:42.352
It is with deep regret that I inform you

23:42.519 --> 23:46.690
that he was killed in the line of duty
just a few days ago.

23:46.857 --> 23:51.820
<i>He died in the defence of others, and
his sacrifice may have saved many lives...</i>

23:51.987 --> 23:54.698
...and her keen curiosity
are some of the qualities

23:54.865 --> 24:00.453
that your daughter displayed during
her duties as a scientist on my team.

24:00.620 --> 24:04.666
She and several of her colleagues
died suddenly just a few weeks ago.

24:04.833 --> 24:07.794
I am not at liberty
to reveal the cause of her death,

24:07.961 --> 24:10.630
but I can tell you
that during her time here,

24:10.797 --> 24:14.718
<i>Dr Dumais was a part
of something very profound.</i>

24:14.885 --> 24:18.680
<i>She saw and did things
she never would have dreamed of...</i>

24:18.847 --> 24:21.641
He died bravely, while defending others.

24:21.808 --> 24:24.811
I confess I didn't know him
as well as I could have,

24:24.978 --> 24:29.107
but I know he was well liked
and respected among his peers.

24:29.274 --> 24:33.445
<i>And I was told of how often
he spoke of his family.</i>

24:34.738 --> 24:36.656
<i>I do wish I could tell you more.</i>

24:39.284 --> 24:42.746
I'm sure you understand,
as a military family.

24:51.671 --> 24:53.924
Are you done, ma'am?

24:56.134 --> 24:59.346
Just give me a moment,
please, Lieutenant.

24:59.513 --> 25:02.224
I am keeping busy with my job.

25:02.390 --> 25:07.604
I work hard, like everyone else,
to ensure the success of this expedition,

25:07.771 --> 25:10.398
and to please
the leader of our science team...

25:10.565 --> 25:14.402
No, no, no, no, no. This sequence first,
and then the secondary code.

25:14.569 --> 25:17.447
Unless you're trying to blow us up.
If so, good work.

25:17.614 --> 25:22.577
He does not always remember my name,
but I have enjoyed working for him.

25:22.744 --> 25:26.289
What is this? Kiwi?
Who made this? Did you make this?

25:26.456 --> 25:29.292
He's a very honourable and brave man.

25:29.459 --> 25:33.964
Ow! Ow! OK, cramp,
cramp, cramp, cramp, cramp... Ow!

25:34.131 --> 25:38.009
Until then I will continue
to serve at his pleasure.

25:38.176 --> 25:41.847
I once caught mono
kissing a girl in algebra club.

25:42.013 --> 25:44.307
I missed an entire month of school.

25:44.474 --> 25:49.187
Still, the kiss was... something,
so it was probably worth it.

25:50.397 --> 25:52.524
April Bingham. Cute blonde.

25:52.691 --> 25:58.572
God, see, I love blondes. Especially
with the, uh... the short hair. Mm...

26:01.616 --> 26:06.413
Samantha Carter, if you're watching,
the torch is still burning.

26:06.580 --> 26:09.040
Sadly, soon to be extinguished,

26:09.207 --> 26:15.297
but, you know,
you should know I think you are just so...

26:15.464 --> 26:16.923
<i>(sighs)</i>

26:17.090 --> 26:20.218
Well, you're great,
you're really, really great,

26:20.385 --> 26:23.930
and you're the hottest scientist
I've ever worked with.

26:24.097 --> 26:27.851
There's probably not a night
that goes by that I don't find myself...

26:28.018 --> 26:30.437
OK, Ford, let's lose that,

26:30.604 --> 26:37.235
and let's get back to, uh... leadership.

26:46.161 --> 26:48.622
<i>(distant shouting)</i>

26:59.299 --> 27:02.093
<i>(man) Run, children! Run!</i>

27:02.260 --> 27:04.387
<i>(woman screaming)</i>

27:15.148 --> 27:17.359
<i>(man) Hurry!</i>

27:38.588 --> 27:41.967
- Who will be watching this?
- Anyone you're sending it to.

27:42.134 --> 27:44.219
Family, friends, loved ones.

27:44.386 --> 27:48.765
- Will anyone from Atlantis be viewing it?
- No, messages are private.

27:48.932 --> 27:52.144
- You can get as mushy as you want.
- All right.

27:53.145 --> 27:58.608
Uh, this is a message for General
Jack O'Neill of Stargate Command.

27:58.775 --> 28:03.113
It is my duty to inform you of what I
consider to be serious errors in judgement

28:03.280 --> 28:08.201
among the leaders of this expedition,
most notably Dr Elizabeth Weir.

28:08.368 --> 28:11.163
Her actions have
repeatedly and recklessly

28:11.329 --> 28:14.458
exposed the people of this expedition
to extreme danger,

28:14.624 --> 28:19.045
leading us directly to the grave situation
we currently find ourselves in.

28:19.212 --> 28:21.006
You know what?

28:21.173 --> 28:23.633
How about you record
your whining in private?

28:23.800 --> 28:26.720
Fine.

28:29.806 --> 28:34.603
I've recorded her questionable activities,
which I would like to detail for you now.

28:40.859 --> 28:44.779
<i>(man in distance) Quickly! Quickly!</i>

28:56.833 --> 28:59.795
<i>(man) Run for the trees!</i>

29:10.430 --> 29:14.142
Never cared for dogs. Too much work,
too needy, too unpredictable.

29:14.309 --> 29:17.270
You leave one door open
and they're gone.

29:17.437 --> 29:19.314
You look for them, it's no use,

29:19.481 --> 29:22.234
and since your father
refused to buy a licence,

29:22.400 --> 29:24.945
the animal shelter can't track them.

29:25.111 --> 29:27.697
God knows what happened
to that little guy.

29:27.864 --> 29:30.659
Now, cats...
now, that's a whole different story.

29:30.826 --> 29:35.038
Cats are self-sufficient, dependable.
You shake the box, they come running.

29:35.205 --> 29:39.543
A cynic would say it's because of the food,
but my cat, he enjoys my company.

29:39.709 --> 29:42.045
It's very comforting
to come home from work

29:42.212 --> 29:45.132
and have a familiar face waiting for you.

29:45.298 --> 29:47.801
Still, I digress. Where was I?

29:47.968 --> 29:52.848
Uh... right. Leadership.

30:00.897 --> 30:03.733
<i>(distant shouting)</i>

30:10.157 --> 30:12.576
<i>(man in distance) Keep going! Keep going!</i>

30:30.177 --> 30:32.429
<i>(Teyla) Over here!</i>

30:32.596 --> 30:36.725
It is all right. I am a friend.
Please, hurry. This way.

30:36.892 --> 30:38.977
Hurry. This way.

30:54.993 --> 30:58.830
- How many of you are left?
- I don't know. The Wraith are everywhere.

30:58.997 --> 31:01.708
Here, drink this. It is water.

31:01.875 --> 31:05.212
Orin... Have you seen him?

31:05.378 --> 31:08.632
Not since before the Wraith arrived.
Thank you.

31:10.884 --> 31:14.304
- We must go. The Wraith will find us.
- No, they will not.

31:14.471 --> 31:18.517
Our ship has a shield which makes it
invisible to them. You are safe here.

31:18.683 --> 31:21.311
Just rest.

31:21.478 --> 31:23.563
We will leave soon.

31:32.989 --> 31:38.119
I'd like to say something to the families
of every member of this expedition.

31:39.663 --> 31:43.583
I wish I could tell you more
about what your loved ones are doing,

31:43.750 --> 31:48.588
and someday I hope you find out,
because you will be amazed,

31:50.298 --> 31:56.638
but I will tell you that I could not be more
proud of each and every one of them.

31:56.805 --> 31:59.891
Their heroism has amazed me.

32:24.916 --> 32:27.544
Their resourcefulness has staggered me.

32:36.011 --> 32:37.971
- Rodney, go!
- Going!

32:42.142 --> 32:44.227
Now!

32:49.399 --> 32:52.694
We face a terrible enemy
and an uncertain future,

32:53.862 --> 32:56.323
but if we are never heard from again,

32:56.490 --> 33:00.702
know that your loved ones
did not face that uncertainty alone.

33:01.745 --> 33:04.706
We are facing our future together.

33:07.501 --> 33:09.753
<i>(distant shouting)</i>

33:25.602 --> 33:27.687
Major.

33:30.857 --> 33:33.693
It's pretty ugly out there.

33:33.860 --> 33:36.613
- Is this Orin's family?
- No.

33:38.740 --> 33:41.368
They have not seen Orin
since the culling began.

33:41.535 --> 33:44.704
The village is wiped out.

33:53.296 --> 33:56.591
<i>- (whirring)
- The gate just shut off.</i>

33:57.926 --> 34:01.888
We should be able to get out of here
before the Wraith can do anything.

34:02.055 --> 34:04.683
Please, Major. Give Orin more time.

34:04.850 --> 34:10.021
If he was able to get here, he would be
here by now. We've got to get back.

34:10.188 --> 34:14.192
Go. I will stay and search in the daylight.
You can return for me later.

34:14.359 --> 34:17.112
- You can't do that.
- I consider Orin as family.

34:17.279 --> 34:20.949
- I am sorry if you do not understand...
- That's not the point...

34:21.116 --> 34:24.995
With you or without you, I am staying.

34:26.746 --> 34:30.292
You won't make it.

34:30.458 --> 34:33.753
Then I ask that you stay as well,
just a little longer.

34:35.880 --> 34:38.091
Allow something good to come of this.

34:42.219 --> 34:44.806
All right. We'll give it a little more time.

34:52.355 --> 34:54.815
I know you worry about me, Mum,

34:54.983 --> 34:58.236
but somehow we've found a way
to rise to each challenge,

34:58.403 --> 35:00.572
so I wouldn't fret about my safety.

35:00.739 --> 35:05.452
It's the people here, from dozens of
countries, all connected by a single bond.

35:05.619 --> 35:07.829
We represent the people of Earth,

35:07.996 --> 35:12.959
and if there's one thing I know about
we Earthlings, we're a scrappy bunch...

35:13.126 --> 35:16.922
<i>(Ford) You can't say Earthlings.
Your mother doesn't have clearance.</i>

35:17.088 --> 35:20.050
She knows I'm from Earth.
It's not a bloody secret.

35:20.217 --> 35:22.969
- Oh, right.
- Sorry, Mum. Anyhow...

35:23.136 --> 35:26.223
Authorised using a prisoner
to test an experimental drug,

35:26.389 --> 35:28.725
in clear violation
of the Geneva Convention.

35:28.892 --> 35:30.769
Lowered the Stargate shield

35:30.936 --> 35:34.356
when the authenticity
of incoming travellers was in question.

35:34.523 --> 35:37.275
That's another sight
I'll die without having seen.

35:37.442 --> 35:39.653
When you've travelled as much as I have,

35:39.820 --> 35:43.114
you'd think that missing Niagara Falls
would be no big deal.

35:43.281 --> 35:45.492
There's a lot of movies I wish I'd seen.

35:45.659 --> 35:48.870
<i>Never saw Grease, even though
I fancied Olivia Newton-John.</i>

35:49.037 --> 35:53.792
<i>Always wanted to see Gandhi.
Only saw the first half of The Sixth Sense.</i>

35:55.627 --> 35:58.463
My sister...

35:58.630 --> 36:03.009
Ford, if you cut everything else,
just, um... keep this part, OK?

36:04.427 --> 36:06.930
Jeannie, it's your brother, Rodney.

36:08.014 --> 36:10.100
Obviously.

36:10.267 --> 36:12.561
I want to say, um...

36:14.187 --> 36:16.356
I want to say something. Uh...

36:18.150 --> 36:20.902
Family is important.

36:21.069 --> 36:24.656
I've come to realise that, because
the people here have become a...

36:24.823 --> 36:27.284
kind of a surrogate family to me.

36:27.450 --> 36:31.955
I know I've never really been
the poster child for that kind of sentiment,

36:32.122 --> 36:37.419
but when one's contemplating one's
own demise, one sees things more clearly.

36:39.796 --> 36:44.092
I really do wish you the best, you know,
and I'm sorry we weren't closer.

36:44.259 --> 36:50.265
Perhaps, um...
if by chance I make it out of this,

36:50.432 --> 36:53.393
perhaps one day we can be,
and I would like that.

36:55.020 --> 37:01.109
Now, if there's time, I'd like
to go back to the subject of leadership.

37:02.652 --> 37:05.405
Someone's coming.

37:19.961 --> 37:21.838
Orin!

37:22.714 --> 37:25.091
- Orin!
- How big is his family?

37:25.258 --> 37:28.011
- He must have met others.
- That'll be a problem.

37:28.178 --> 37:31.515
- I didn't think you'd be here.
- We would not have left you.

37:31.681 --> 37:34.726
We found others on the way,
and more further behind.

37:34.893 --> 37:38.146
- How many more?
- 12, perhaps more.

37:38.313 --> 37:42.025
In here! This way!

37:42.192 --> 37:44.236
Quickly!

37:44.402 --> 37:46.947
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

37:52.619 --> 37:56.123
- We'll fit as many people in as we can.
- Hurry! Come on!

37:57.541 --> 37:59.626
Straight ahead. Straight ahead.

38:04.381 --> 38:07.300
- Hurry.
- Come on!

38:07.467 --> 38:12.097
- Run!
- It's all right. It is all right.

38:14.724 --> 38:17.352
<i>- Get down!
- (screaming)</i>

38:33.368 --> 38:36.663
<i>(man yells)</i>

38:49.801 --> 38:52.929
- Are you all right?
- Yes. I'm fine.

39:21.458 --> 39:25.003
- Are our guests comfortably settled in?
- Yes.

39:25.170 --> 39:27.255
Good.

39:28.465 --> 39:33.553
- So tell me. How bad is it?
- Bad.

39:36.473 --> 39:39.059
Each hive ship acts like a carrier group,

39:39.226 --> 39:43.396
with cruisers
and hundreds of darts escorting it.

39:43.563 --> 39:47.150
Grodin's downloading the sensor readings
right now.

39:47.317 --> 39:50.070
I have never witnessed a culling
that took so many.

39:50.237 --> 39:53.323
We saved a few. That's worth something.

39:55.200 --> 39:57.661
Rodney, are we ready
to send our message?

39:57.828 --> 39:59.955
- When you are.
- OK.

40:07.754 --> 40:11.842
Lieutenant Ford is recording personal
messages from all the team members.

40:12.008 --> 40:14.928
- If you'd like...
- I'm good.

40:15.095 --> 40:16.471
OK.

40:16.638 --> 40:18.723
Along with a short note of my own,

40:18.890 --> 40:22.269
I recorded messages
to the families of the people we've lost.

40:22.435 --> 40:27.065
- That's a good idea.
- There's one I thought you'd like to do.

40:34.489 --> 40:37.325
<i>(Ford) OK, whenever you're ready,
sir, go ahead.</i>

40:37.492 --> 40:42.456
I'm not sure
if Colonel Sumner's parents are still alive.

40:42.622 --> 40:46.376
I'm not sure he even has a family
back there. Not all of us do.

40:46.543 --> 40:50.422
But if he does have a family,
they should know

40:50.589 --> 40:55.802
that he died with honour and courage
in the performance of his duty.

40:57.429 --> 41:01.183
He carried the burden of a leader
and he carried it well.

41:03.185 --> 41:08.940
I didn't get the chance to know him well,
but I know this.

41:09.983 --> 41:14.571
Considering the type of man he was
and what we're up against,

41:14.738 --> 41:17.032
yeah, I wish he was still here.

41:19.659 --> 41:23.455
Not a day goes by
that I don't think of you, Simon.

41:23.622 --> 41:29.836
There's so much I want to tell you
and share with you, but I can't.

41:32.464 --> 41:34.925
I know this is unfair.

41:35.091 --> 41:39.346
So much you don't know,
and putting your life on hold for me...

41:42.808 --> 41:44.976
so don't.

41:46.019 --> 41:49.523
All I ask is you take care of yourself,

41:49.689 --> 41:54.736
and know that, wherever you are,
my heart is looking after you.

41:56.029 --> 41:59.324
So take care of yourself, lots of sleep,

41:59.491 --> 42:04.329
remember your daily walks
and keep up with your prescription.

42:04.496 --> 42:06.373
Well, that's about it.

42:06.540 --> 42:08.834
I'll say goodbye now...

42:10.252 --> 42:13.672
and, Mum, I do love you.

42:13.839 --> 42:16.633
Bye, Grandma, Grandpa. I miss you.

42:16.800 --> 42:18.426
Goodbye, bro.

42:18.593 --> 42:21.138
<i>(speaks Czech)</i>

42:21.304 --> 42:23.306
Goodbye.

42:23.473 --> 42:25.517
Goodbye, Simon.

42:25.684 --> 42:28.270
Goodbye.

42:36.653 --> 42:39.489
We have unscheduled off-world activation.

42:39.656 --> 42:42.159
<i>(woman) Linking now.</i>

42:43.743 --> 42:46.955
Receiving transmission.

42:50.167 --> 42:52.377
Who's it from?

42:53.753 --> 42:56.631
Atlantis.
