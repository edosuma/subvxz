- UH...

06:35.433 --> 06:36.900
AH...

IS HE OKAY, DOCTOR?

06:44.367 --> 06:45.433

09:48.067 --> 09:49.100
- BUT YOU'RE CRYING.

09:49.100 --> 09:50.500
- OH.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.433
I APPLIED BROOKE DIAMOND
REVITALIZING EYE CREAM

09:52.433 --> 09:54.833
BEFORE I CAME HERE TODAY.

09:54.833 --> 09:56.867
THE BURNING MEANS IT'S WORKING.

09:56.867 --> 09:59.700
GO GET YOUR THINGS.
OUR FLIGHT LEAVES AT 5:00.

10:04.800 --> 10:07.467
- WELL, I HAVE A MOTHER'S DAY
SURPRISE FOR YOU.

10:07.467 --> 10:09.100
I'VE CLEARED MY SCHEDULE.

10:09.100 --> 10:10.833
NO PETS.
JUST MY MOM.

10:10.833 --> 10:13.533
- AND I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU.

10:13.533 --> 10:15.667
I NOTICED YOU DIDN'T HAVE
MANY PATIENTS,

10:15.667 --> 10:19.267
SO I BOUGHT YOU A BENCH
TO MAKE YOUR BUSINESS THRIVE.

10:19.267 --> 10:20.633
- A BENCH?

10:20.633 --> 10:22.533
YOU MEAN, LIKE,
A BUNCH BUS WITH ADS.

10:22.533 --> 10:23.900
- YOU'RE SITTING ON ONE.

10:26.367 --> 10:28.133
ACTUALLY,
I BOUGHT YOU 20 BENCHES

10:28.133 --> 10:30.500
AND A BILLBOARD ON SUNSET.

10:30.500 --> 10:31.800
- WHAT?

10:31.800 --> 10:34.500
[dogs barking]
[cat meows]

10:34.500 --> 10:36.467
[dog barking]

10:36.467 --> 10:38.367
[monkey screeching]

10:38.367 --> 10:39.733
[cat wails]

10:39.733 --> 10:41.867
[dog barks]

10:41.867 --> 10:43.367
[goat bleats]

10:43.367 --> 10:45.133
- DUDE, YOU ARE TOAST.

10:45.133 --> 10:46.367
- WE.

10:46.367 --> 10:47.733
WE ARE TOAST,

10:47.733 --> 10:49.300
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA HELP ME
CURE ALL THESE ANIMALS.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.533
- NO, I'M NOT.

10:50.533 --> 10:52.500
- I'LL GIVE YOU 500 BUCKS.

10:52.500 --> 10:53.667
[elephant trumpets]

10:53.667 --> 10:55.233
- LET'S DO THIS.

10:55.233 --> 10:58.367
- MY SON'S LUCKY COMB
AND TOOTHBRUSH

10:58.367 --> 11:03.100
ARE NOW PACKED
AND READY TO GO IN HIS SUITCASE.

11:06.067 --> 11:07.833
- I'M SORRY, GUYS.

11:07.833 --> 11:08.967
all: HELP US!

11:08.967 --> 11:10.300
- I CAN'T GO UP AGAINST BROOKE.

11:10.300 --> 11:11.333
- [whispers]
SHE SCARES ME.

11:12.367 --> 11:13.433
BUT JAMES CAN.

11:13.433 --> 11:14.567
- NO, JAMES CAN'T.

11:14.567 --> 11:15.967
- JAMES, THERE COMES A TIME

11:15.967 --> 11:18.233
WHEN EVERY CHILD
HAS TO STAND UP TO THEIR MOM,

11:18.233 --> 11:20.333
AND YOUR TIME IS NOW.

11:20.333 --> 11:24.067
IF YOU ARE PASSIONATE
ABOUT STAYING IN THIS BAND,

11:24.067 --> 11:25.933
YOUR MOM
WILL SEE IT IN YOUR EYES

11:25.933 --> 11:28.067
AND DO WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU,

11:28.067 --> 11:29.700
NOT HER.

11:29.700 --> 11:30.933
IT'S WHAT MOMS DO.

11:30.933 --> 11:32.700
- SHE'S RIGHT.

11:32.700 --> 11:34.600
- MOMS KNOW BEST.

11:34.600 --> 11:37.433
- YOU HAVE THE POWER
TO TELL YOUR MOM NO.

11:37.433 --> 11:38.733
- WHOO.

11:38.733 --> 11:39.867
I CAN DO THIS.

11:39.867 --> 11:40.900
- YES!
- YES!

11:40.900 --> 11:42.100
- YES, JAMES!
- GO FOR IT, JAMES!

11:42.100 --> 11:44.933
- BTR MEANS WAY MORE TO ME
THAN COSMETICS.

11:44.933 --> 11:47.467
I'M GONNA TELL MY MOM NO.

11:47.467 --> 11:48.767
- YEAH!
- YOU GOT IT.

11:48.767 --> 11:50.267
[all cheering]

11:50.267 --> 11:51.600
- YOU GOT IT, JAMES.

11:51.600 --> 11:54.067
- WHOO!

11:54.067 --> 11:55.567
OH.

11:55.567 --> 11:56.667
- WELL, IT'S BEEN FUN.

11:56.667 --> 11:58.433
NOW I'M OFF TO MINNESOTA.

11:58.433 --> 11:59.367
HEH.

12:00.533 --> 12:02.233
[air hissing]

12:13.467 --> 12:16.100
- [gasps]
WE NEED A PLAN.

12:16.100 --> 12:17.467
- RUN.

12:21.967 --> 12:24.600
- WE NEED TO FIND
A BETTER PLAN THAN "RUN."

12:24.600 --> 12:26.067
- GET THE DOOR.

12:26.067 --> 12:27.100
- GOT IT.

12:27.100 --> 12:28.500
- HEY, GUYS, DON'T WAIT
FOR THE SHUTTLE.

12:28.500 --> 12:30.133
THAT'S USELESS.
[laughs nervously]

12:30.133 --> 12:31.667
- RIGHT THIS WAY.

12:31.667 --> 12:35.100
- WE'RE THE DIAMONDS.
OUR FLIGHT GOT CANCELLED.

12:35.100 --> 12:36.367
- OKAY.

12:36.367 --> 12:38.567
- TAKE EXTRA CARE
OF THE DIAMONDS.

12:38.567 --> 12:40.233
THEY'RE SELECTIVE MUTES,

12:40.233 --> 12:42.933
AND THEY'RE LATE
FOR THEIR FLIGHT, SO PUNCH IT.

12:42.933 --> 12:44.067
[tires screech]

12:44.067 --> 12:45.633
- YEAH!

12:45.633 --> 12:47.633
all: OH!

12:47.633 --> 12:49.967
- WE TRIED TO STOP THEM,
BUT THEY JUST TOOK YOUR LIMO.

12:49.967 --> 12:52.400
- YEAH, THE NERVE
OF SOME PEOPLE.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.233
- GUESS THAT MEANS
YOU'RE GONNA MISS YOUR FLIGHT.

12:54.233 --> 12:56.400
- OH, DARN IT.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.067
- GRRR!
- UGH!

12:58.067 --> 13:02.233
- IT'S NICE TO SEE L.A.
HASN'T CHANGED YOU BOYS.

13:02.233 --> 13:06.400
BUT I HAVEN'T CHANGED EITHER,
AND I ALWAYS GET WHAT I WANT.

13:06.400 --> 13:07.567
[phone beeps]

13:07.567 --> 13:09.400
SARAH, GET ME AND MY SON

13:09.400 --> 13:12.100
ON THE FIRST FLIGHT
TO MINNESOTA TOMORROW.

13:12.100 --> 13:15.633
AND GET HIM 10 BUSINESS SUITS,
20 POWER TIES,

13:15.633 --> 13:19.067
AND A PAIR
OF SIZE 11 TASSELED LOAFERS.

13:19.067 --> 13:20.233
- [whimpers]

13:22.700 --> 13:25.633
- UGH!
HE'S FROZEN AGAIN.

13:25.633 --> 13:27.867
BE DARLINGS
AND UNFREEZE HIM FOR ME.

13:27.867 --> 13:30.433
THANK YOU.

13:30.433 --> 13:32.400
- JAMES, COME ON.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.600
- OKAY, COME ON.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.533
[horse whinnies]

13:38.767 --> 13:40.067
- OKAY, BYE-BYE.

13:40.067 --> 13:41.800
SO YOUR LIZARD WON'T EAT.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.133
- MATURE LIZARDS
STOP EATING LIVE FOOD

13:46.133 --> 13:47.400
AND GO VEGETARIAN.

13:47.400 --> 13:48.967
- JUST FEED HIM LETTUCE
FROM NOW ON,

13:48.967 --> 13:51.067
AND HE SHOULD BE FINE.

13:52.433 --> 13:57.167
AND WHAT SEEMS TO BE WRONG
WITH YOUR GUINEA PIG?

13:57.167 --> 13:58.467
- HE'S SO SAD.

13:58.467 --> 14:00.800
- GUINEA PIGS ARE MUCH HAPPIER
WITH CAGE MATES,

14:00.800 --> 14:02.200
BUT DON'T PUT
TWO MALES TOGETHER,

14:02.200 --> 14:04.067
OR THEY'LL EAT
EACH OTHER'S FACES OFF.

14:04.067 --> 14:06.167
- HEAD DOWN
TO THE PET STORE ASAP

14:06.167 --> 14:09.233
AND GET YOUR ROMEO HERE
A JULIET.

14:09.233 --> 14:10.367
[laughs]

14:10.367 --> 14:12.233
OKAY.

14:12.233 --> 14:13.567
[dog whimpers]

14:13.567 --> 14:16.700
AND WHAT SEEMS TO BE
THIS LITTLE FELLAS PROBLEM?

14:16.700 --> 14:20.067
- IT HAS AN ARROW
THROUGH ITS BUTT.

14:20.067 --> 14:21.100
TELL HER TO GO STRAIGHT

14:21.100 --> 14:23.233
TO THE EMERGENCY
ANIMAL HOSPITAL ON THIRD.

14:23.233 --> 14:25.733
- TAKE HIM TO THE EMERGENCY
ANIMAL HOSPITAL ON THIRD.

14:25.733 --> 14:27.733
HE SHOULD BE OKAY.
- THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

14:27.733 --> 14:29.100
- YOU MIGHT WANT TO HURRY.

14:33.067 --> 14:35.367
- ALL THIS PRIDE
IS MAKING ME SO TIRED,

14:35.367 --> 14:38.700
I NEED TO TAKE A NAP, DOCTOR.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.333
- BOO-YA!

14:45.333 --> 14:47.800
ALL THE ANIMALS ARE FIXED,
YOUR MOM IS HAPPY,

14:47.800 --> 14:49.667
AND MY PLAN WORKED PERFECTLY.

14:49.667 --> 14:50.900
I'M AMAZING.

14:50.900 --> 14:53.067
AND I GOT ALL THE BENCH BANNERS
FROM AROUND TOWN.

14:53.067 --> 14:55.333
PLUS, I DEFACED YOUR BILLBOARD.

14:55.333 --> 14:58.400
SO NOBODY SHOULD BE CALLING
DR. BITTERS ANYMORE.

14:58.400 --> 15:00.400
[horns honking]

15:01.833 --> 15:03.767
- THAT'LL BE 500 BUCKS, PLEASE.

15:03.767 --> 15:05.567
- ACTUALLY,
THERE'S ONE MORE THING.

15:05.567 --> 15:09.067
MY MOM EXPECTS TO MEET
MY WIFE AND SON TOMORROW.

15:13.067 --> 15:14.667
- GUSTAVO,
WHEN I SAID "ANY TIME,"

15:14.667 --> 15:15.967
I DIDN'T REALLY MEAN IT.

15:15.967 --> 15:17.300
- AH-DH-DH-DH-DH-DH.

15:17.300 --> 15:18.700
[feedback humming]

15:18.700 --> 15:20.200
[loud electric guitar chord]

15:20.200 --> 15:21.233
- OH!

15:21.233 --> 15:22.667
- WHOA.

15:22.667 --> 15:24.400
- YES!

15:24.400 --> 15:25.700
JAMES? JAMES.

15:28.200 --> 15:29.400
- IT'S NO USE.

15:29.400 --> 15:31.133
SHE'S THE MOST POWERFUL MOM
IN THE UNIVERSE.

15:31.133 --> 15:33.567
- WHY CAN'T YOUR DAD JUST
TALK HER INTO LETTING YOU STAY?

15:33.567 --> 15:35.500
- THEY DON'T TALK ANYMORE
SINCE THE DIVORCE

15:35.500 --> 15:38.300
AND SINCE DAD REMARRIED
A WOMAN 15 YEARS YOUNGER.

15:38.300 --> 15:40.700
- WELL, I DON'T BLAME HER!

15:40.700 --> 15:43.300
- YOU MEAN NO ONE
HAS EVER DEFEATED YOUR MOTHER,

15:43.300 --> 15:44.733
EVER?

15:44.733 --> 15:47.800
- WELL, THERE WAS THIS ONE TIME
MY MOM DIDN'T GET HER WAY.

15:47.800 --> 15:50.067
BUT DAD AND I WERE TOLD
NEVER TO SPEAK ABOUT IT.

15:50.067 --> 15:51.133
[whispers]
EVER.

15:51.133 --> 15:53.400
- WELL, WHAT WAS IT?
YOU HAVE TO TELL US.

15:53.400 --> 15:55.633
- WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU,
JAMES!

15:55.633 --> 15:57.900
- [whispers] WE PROMISED
TO SAVE IT FOR THE GRAVE.

15:57.900 --> 16:00.467
- WE HAVE TO SAVE THE BAND.

16:00.467 --> 16:01.567
both: COME ON!

16:01.567 --> 16:03.167
- IT WAS
THE PEEWEE HOCKEY PARTY.

16:03.167 --> 16:06.267
MY MOM ORDERED SUSHI PLATTERS
AND RESERVED A STRING QUARTET.

16:06.267 --> 16:09.333
BUT OTHER MOMS WANTED BEANS,
WEENIES, AND A BOUNCE HOUSE.

16:09.333 --> 16:11.867
- OH!
THAT WAS THE BEST PARTY EVER.

16:11.867 --> 16:14.200
- KENDALL'S, LOGAN'S,
AND CARLOS' MOMS CAME OVER.

16:14.200 --> 16:15.633
THERE WAS YELLING AND TEARS.

16:15.633 --> 16:17.233
MY DAD HID
BEHIND THE FLAT SCREEN.

16:17.233 --> 16:19.700
I'VE NEVER SEEN MOM SO ANGRY.

16:19.700 --> 16:21.667
BUT THE OTHER MOMS
HELD THEIR GROUND.

16:21.667 --> 16:24.167
- THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.

16:24.167 --> 16:26.300
YOU CAN'T DEFEAT YOUR MOM
ONE-ON-ONE.

16:26.300 --> 16:29.933
YOU HAVE TO FIGHT MOM
WITH MOMS.

16:29.933 --> 16:31.967
- KELLY,
GET MY FREQUENT FLIER MILES

16:31.967 --> 16:34.400
AND GET THE OTHER MOMS HERE
BY THE MORNING.

16:34.400 --> 16:37.467
THIS IS GONNA BE A MOTHER'S DAY
WE WILL NEVER FORGET.

16:37.467 --> 16:39.367
[rooster crows]

16:41.967 --> 16:44.400
all: HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY!

16:44.400 --> 16:46.900
- DO I GET SOME PEACE AND QUIET
AND MY BEDROOM BACK?

16:46.900 --> 16:47.967
- CLOSE.

16:47.967 --> 16:49.700
all: WE'RE GOING TO THE AIRPORT.

16:54.467 --> 16:57.267
- THIS IS NOT PEACEFUL
OR QUIET!

17:00.533 --> 17:02.833
- UH, SORRY WE DIDN'T INVITE YOU
TO THE WEDDING,

17:02.833 --> 17:04.933
BUT I COME FROM A LONG LINE
OF INTERLOPERS.

17:04.933 --> 17:06.333
[grunts]

17:06.333 --> 17:07.333
- ELOPERS.

17:07.333 --> 17:08.767
- UH, ELOPERS.

17:08.767 --> 17:10.200
- [laughs nervously]
- YEP, ELOPERS.

17:10.200 --> 17:12.267
- AND WHERE
DID YOU TWO MEET, AGAIN?

17:15.300 --> 17:16.367
- UH...

17:16.367 --> 17:17.367
A SWAMP.

17:20.633 --> 17:25.067
- WHAT SHE MEANT TO SAY WAS,
WE MET AT A WEDDING.

17:25.067 --> 17:29.133
AND HER MOM INTRODUCED US,
AND IT WAS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.

17:31.533 --> 17:32.900
- THANK GOODNESS FOR MOMS.

17:32.900 --> 17:34.200
WHERE WOULD THE WORLD BE

17:34.200 --> 17:37.533
WITHOUT THEIR LOVE,
COMPASSION, AND STRENGTH?

17:37.533 --> 17:38.867
- OH.

17:38.867 --> 17:41.867
[dramatic music]

17:41.867 --> 17:49.800
*

17:55.267 --> 18:03.267
*

18:14.400 --> 18:19.733
*

18:19.733 --> 18:22.067
- SYLVIA, JOANNA?

18:22.067 --> 18:23.933
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

18:23.933 --> 18:26.067
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

18:26.067 --> 18:28.633
- BREAKING UP BIG TIME RUSH,
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND.

18:28.633 --> 18:29.967
- JAMES IS COMING HOME WITH ME

18:29.967 --> 18:31.600
TO LEARN
ABOUT THE FAMILY BUSINESS,

18:31.600 --> 18:33.267
AND THAT IS FINAL.

18:33.267 --> 18:34.833
- AND IT'S NOT FAIR.

18:34.833 --> 18:38.300
THIS BAND AND THIS FRIENDSHIP
MEAN THE WORLD TO THESE BOYS.

18:38.300 --> 18:40.467
- AND WE ALL AGREED
TO LET THE BOYS MOVE OUT HERE,

18:40.467 --> 18:41.967
STAY WITH JEN,
AND BE IN THIS BAND.

18:41.967 --> 18:43.733
AND YOU CAN JUST UN-AGREE.

18:45.667 --> 18:48.600
- NOBODY IS GOING TO TAKE MY SON
AWAY FROM ME.

18:48.600 --> 18:52.433
HE IS MY BOY,
AND I NEVER SEE HIM ANYMORE.

18:52.433 --> 18:54.233
HE IS COMING HOME.

18:56.533 --> 18:57.567
- WHAT IS GOING ON?

18:57.567 --> 18:58.833
- WHAT DID SHE SAY?

18:58.833 --> 19:00.567
- WHAT HAPPENED?

19:00.567 --> 19:03.367
- SHE MISSES YOU.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

19:03.367 --> 19:06.067
- SHE DOESN'T WANT JAMES
TO RUN THE COMPANY.

19:06.067 --> 19:08.233
SHE JUST WANTS HIM HOME.

19:08.233 --> 19:11.633
- SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

19:11.633 --> 19:14.667
- MAYBE THE SUPER MOMS
COULD RE-TEAM UP

19:14.667 --> 19:16.167
AND HELP IN A NICER WAY.

19:16.167 --> 19:19.067
- BUT FIRST GIVE MAMA A KISS.

19:21.900 --> 19:23.867
- ME TOO.

19:23.867 --> 19:26.300
- [laughs nervously]
MOM.

19:26.300 --> 19:27.633
- KISS YOUR MOTHER,
HORTENSE!

19:29.333 --> 19:30.633
- LOVE YOU.
- LOVE YOU TOO.

19:33.700 --> 19:36.567
- THIS MUST BE THE BEST
MOTHER'S DAY BRUNCH EVER.

19:36.567 --> 19:39.067
- NOW LET'S GET GRANDMA
ALL PACKED UP

19:39.067 --> 19:40.733
AND OFF TO THE AIRPORT.

19:40.733 --> 19:42.067
- GOSH DARN IT, PA.

19:42.067 --> 19:44.967
- WELL, ALL GOOD THINGS
MUST COME TO AN END.

19:44.967 --> 19:47.100
- SOME BUILDING MANAGER YOU ARE.

19:47.100 --> 19:48.367
- YOU SAID YESTERDAY

19:48.367 --> 19:50.133
YOU WERE GONNA SEND SOMEONE
TO FIX MY CLOG.

19:50.133 --> 19:51.133
- [silently]

19:51.133 --> 19:52.300
- BUT YOU DIDN'T.

19:52.300 --> 19:54.067
AND THE JANITOR IS SITTING,
DOING NOTHING?

19:54.067 --> 19:55.333
IN A DRESS?

19:57.333 --> 19:58.867
I'M MOVING OUT.

19:58.867 --> 20:01.900
- OH, SO CLOSE.

20:01.900 --> 20:05.567
- BUILDING MANAGER?
JANITOR?

20:05.567 --> 20:07.367
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE,
REGINALD?

20:07.367 --> 20:09.567
- MOM, I CAN EXPLAIN
EVERYTHING.

20:09.567 --> 20:11.033
- OH, NO NEED.

20:11.033 --> 20:14.300
I THINK I UNDERSTAND
EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON.

20:16.933 --> 20:19.833
YOU TWO ARE REALLY
UNDERCOVER C.I.A. AGENTS,

20:19.833 --> 20:23.033
AND HE IS THE CHIEF.

20:23.033 --> 20:25.900
AND YOU COULDN'T TELL ME
ALL THESE YEARS,

20:25.900 --> 20:27.800
OR I COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED.

20:27.800 --> 20:29.433
all: YUP.

20:29.433 --> 20:32.433
[dramatic music]

20:32.433 --> 20:34.867
*

20:34.867 --> 20:37.400
- SORRY, MOM.
I HAVE TO LEAVE.

20:37.400 --> 20:38.667
WE'RE OFF TO BANGKOK

20:38.667 --> 20:41.167
TO FIGHT EVIL
AND SAVE THE WORLD.

20:41.167 --> 20:42.167
[gun clicks]

20:42.167 --> 20:44.433
- I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

20:44.433 --> 20:46.200
- MOVE OUT.

20:51.767 --> 20:54.900
- BROOKE, BEFORE YOU TAKE JAMES
TO THE AIRPORT,

20:54.900 --> 20:57.467
JUST HEAR US OUT.

21:00.100 --> 21:03.333
- MY MOM HOOKED UP THE ENTIRE
APARTMENT WITH A T-1 LINE

21:03.333 --> 21:06.900
AND SET UP ALL THE COMPUTERS
WITH FACE TALK.

21:06.900 --> 21:09.100
- AND I CAN SET IT UP
ON YOUR PHONE

21:09.100 --> 21:12.567
SO YOU CAN SEE YOUR SON
ANYTIME YOU WANT.

21:12.567 --> 21:14.733
[computer beeps]

21:18.733 --> 21:21.267
- MY MOM,
THE REAL ESTATE SUPER AGENT,

21:21.267 --> 21:24.567
FOUND A SPOT FOR YOU TO OPEN
A WEST COAST OFFICE.

21:24.567 --> 21:26.867
- IT'S A TOTAL WRITE-OFF,
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,

21:26.867 --> 21:28.467
IT GIVES YOU AN EXCUSE
TO VISIT JAMES

21:28.467 --> 21:29.833
AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH.

21:32.433 --> 21:35.367
- AND I'VE LEARNED ENOUGH
ABOUT BEING A STAGE MOM

21:35.367 --> 21:39.633
TO KNOW THAT GUSTAVO WILL BOOK
MORE BTR DATES IN THE MIDWEST.

21:39.633 --> 21:43.633
- SO YOU CAN SEE JAMES AND US
SING EVEN MORE.

21:43.633 --> 21:45.567
- WELL, I DID LOVE
HEARING YOU BOYS SING.

21:45.567 --> 21:46.733
- WHAT?

21:46.733 --> 21:48.733
I WILL NOT BE TOLD
TO BOOK MORE DATES.

21:48.733 --> 21:51.067
all: WHAT?

21:51.067 --> 21:53.067
- UH, KELLY, PLEASE,
UH, BOOK A DATE

21:53.067 --> 21:54.933
FOR THE BOYS IN MINNESOTA
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

21:54.933 --> 21:56.067
THANK YOU.
- GOT IT.

22:03.267 --> 22:04.967
- SO YOU DON'T WANT
TO COME BACK TO MINNESOTA

22:04.967 --> 22:05.967
TO WORK FOR THE COMPANY?

22:08.233 --> 22:09.367
- NO.

22:09.367 --> 22:11.533
- WELL, MY SON IS HAPPY.

22:11.533 --> 22:13.367
I CAN SEE HIM WHENEVER I WANT.

22:13.367 --> 22:15.567
THIS IS THE BEST
MOTHER'S DAY PRESENT EVER.

22:20.400 --> 22:21.567
- LONG STORY.

22:21.567 --> 22:23.400
- YES!
[all cheering]

22:25.267 --> 22:27.300
- THIS IS A GREAT MOTHER'S DAY.

22:27.300 --> 22:30.667
AND ONLY ONE THING
COULD MAKE IT BETTER.

22:30.667 --> 22:32.700
- WE KNOW. WE KNOW.

22:32.700 --> 22:35.067
all: PEACE AND QUIET.

22:35.067 --> 22:36.700
[crickets chirping]

22:39.367 --> 22:41.833
all: TOO QUIET.

22:41.833 --> 22:44.067
- I LIKE OUR CRAZY BOYS.

22:44.067 --> 22:45.567
- YEAH, LET'S MAKE SOME NOISE!

22:45.567 --> 22:46.567
all: WHOO!
