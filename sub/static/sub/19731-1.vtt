00:44.620 --> 00:46.710
I'm amazed we got permission to exhume the body.

00:46.750 --> 00:50.750
It's backward. They disregarded
our investigation by burying him to begin with.

00:50.840 --> 00:55.380
Yes, sir. Still, a military cemetery...

00:55.430 --> 00:59.760
It's ridiculously expensive to dispose of
a prosthetic body that can't be reused.

00:59.850 --> 01:03.220
Thanks to their cost-cutting,
we can recover the cyberbrain.

01:03.270 --> 01:04.769
Where are the engineers?

01:06.230 --> 01:08.190
Drawing straws at HQ.

01:08.230 --> 01:12.070
Apparently connecting to a dead criminal's
cyberbrain is "creepy".

01:12.110 --> 01:14.610
We don't know yet that he's a criminal.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.240
Chief Aramaki!

01:16.280 --> 01:18.780
We'll check the contents,
then take it back to headquarters.

01:25.040 --> 01:27.370
What are you waiting for?
Put it down!

01:28.920 --> 01:30.420
Sorry, sir!

01:31.800 --> 01:33.960
Don't open that coffin!

03:23.660 --> 03:25.740
This is from your unit.

04:11.200 --> 04:12.960
Are you military?

04:16.630 --> 04:19.380
I'm Aramaki, with Public Security Section 9.

04:19.420 --> 04:23.260
We're investigating
Lieutenant Colonel Mamuro's murder.

04:23.300 --> 04:25.800
I'm seizing his cyberbrain
and prosthetic body as evidence.

04:25.840 --> 04:30.470
He's also suspected of taking bribes,
and we're investigating that too.

04:30.560 --> 04:32.930
Public Security has no right to ransack this place.

04:32.980 --> 04:35.310
We'll bury him again when the case is closed.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.770
And how do I know you won't pull a cover-up,
or fabricate evidence?

04:38.820 --> 04:43.070
The military is in the middle of
its first major shakeup since the war.

04:43.110 --> 04:47.820
It would be more suspicious
if this only got an internal investigation.

04:47.870 --> 04:51.410
lf he were still with us,
Mamuro would have been the first to say so.

04:51.450 --> 04:53.080
You knew him?

04:53.120 --> 04:55.660
Yes, back when I was an Army man.

04:55.710 --> 04:59.590
There's not a soldier in the world
more squeaky-clean than he was.

05:04.260 --> 05:06.470
Your name and unit?

05:08.350 --> 05:12.180
Major Motoko Kusanagi, Unit 501 .

05:13.730 --> 05:17.770
501 ? So you were his subordinate.

05:19.860 --> 05:21.690
Open it up.

05:21.780 --> 05:24.110
Can l ask your rank?

05:24.150 --> 05:26.700
I was in the old Investigations Section.
That's all.

05:26.780 --> 05:31.530
They sold off whatever wouldn't fit
in the coffin to a junk shop.

05:42.920 --> 05:44.880
That's not his body!

06:08.740 --> 06:10.240
Get down!

07:02.210 --> 07:05.380
Finally back on base, you delinquent?

07:05.420 --> 07:08.300
Why did you authorize Public Security's involvement?!

07:08.340 --> 07:12.550
Since l can't dismiss the possibility
that Mamuro was corrupt, l had no choice.

07:12.590 --> 07:15.600
Unit 501 should be investigating this!

07:16.600 --> 07:20.730
The higher-ups told us to stay out of it.

07:20.770 --> 07:23.310
Someone set a trap at his grave.

07:23.400 --> 07:24.310
lgnore it.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.980
His cyberbrain is gone!

07:27.030 --> 07:29.070
This isn't the time to
stir up a hornet's nest.

07:30.240 --> 07:33.320
Then you believe that
he was taking dirty money?

07:33.370 --> 07:37.160
He got mugged downtown.
That much is fact.

07:37.240 --> 07:42.750
Not an honorable death, but compared
to indictment, maybe he got lucky.

07:42.790 --> 07:46.790
Thanks to him,
our letters of recommendation are on hold, too.

07:46.840 --> 07:48.840
Concentrate on your work for now.

07:48.920 --> 07:50.800
Work?

07:50.840 --> 07:55.680
l distinctly remember asking you to
analyze that infected hardware.

07:55.760 --> 08:00.600
Not possible.
l just got back to Japan today, you know.

08:01.520 --> 08:03.270
True enough.

08:03.310 --> 08:04.850
l'll do the assignment.

08:04.940 --> 08:08.610
ln return, give me leave to go off-base
and authorize direct debit.

08:08.650 --> 08:10.530
Such a problem child.

08:10.610 --> 08:13.990
I'm only going to find out who set the trap.

08:14.030 --> 08:17.660
νery well.
I'll take care of it in Mamuro's place.

08:17.700 --> 08:19.540
Thanks, Kurutsu.

08:21.080 --> 08:24.000
Don't forget your meeting with the brass.

09:50.540 --> 09:53.130
Giichi Mamuro, member of
a special unit of the GSDA,

09:53.210 --> 09:56.090
was murdered on the fifth of this month.

09:56.130 --> 09:59.640
- Niihama police say the investigation into
his possible corruption is ongoing.
- Lieutenant Colonel Mamuro is suspected of taking large bribes...

09:59.680 --> 10:04.060
...while serving as a security official
in Harimadara's weapons export—

10:39.380 --> 10:42.010
Access records of his movements
on the day of his death

10:42.050 --> 10:44.510
and all data from city surveillance cameras.

11:12.790 --> 11:14.500
He was tailed.

11:14.540 --> 11:19.050
Scan anyone who traveled
the same route he did before time of death.

11:23.680 --> 11:25.180
Three...

11:35.320 --> 11:36.820
A fourth?

12:09.430 --> 12:13.100
Three men and a mobile land mine
were following him?

12:19.940 --> 12:22.280
"Funds transferred."

12:25.410 --> 12:26.910
What is this?

12:28.990 --> 12:30.540
Any pain?

12:30.580 --> 12:32.700
Not right now, no.

12:32.750 --> 12:36.120
It's similar to the phantom pain
particular to cyborgs,

12:36.170 --> 12:38.750
but that should not affect you.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.550
Could be a bad contact
in your nervous components.

12:41.590 --> 12:43.590
Any other abnormalities?

12:49.850 --> 12:51.560
No.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.980
We should do a full-body checkup to be safe.

12:54.060 --> 12:58.310
Thank you, but I have a meeting to go to.

13:02.820 --> 13:06.150
Goodness, you have visitors.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.490
They announced themselves
as Public Security Section 9.

13:08.570 --> 13:09.950
Say l'm not here.

13:13.580 --> 13:18.500
As both a Special Cyborg
and a recognized wizard-class programmer,

13:18.580 --> 13:22.130
new regulations apply to you
under the revised Weapons Act.

13:22.170 --> 13:27.180
The Prosthetics Maintenance Rule now applies
to issuing identification,

13:27.260 --> 13:31.850
possessing cash, opening bank accounts,
or other ownership of assets.

13:31.890 --> 13:34.520
ln Lt. Col. Mamuro's letter
on my reclassification,

13:34.560 --> 13:37.980
he guaranteed my financial autonomy.

13:38.020 --> 13:41.860
lf he's proven corrupt,
he'll receive a dishonorable discharge,

13:41.940 --> 13:44.440
and all such documents will be void.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.700
You expect me to endure a position

13:46.780 --> 13:50.030
where l have to file paperwork
every time l open my wallet?

13:50.120 --> 13:53.790
The cost of prosthetic bodies far exceeds
standard health insurance payouts.

13:53.830 --> 13:58.330
You ought to do your duty to the government
which guarantees your right to life.

13:58.370 --> 14:02.210
This is the consent form for your monitoring
and custody post-restructuring.

14:02.250 --> 14:04.710
Make an effort to understand your circumstances.

14:17.850 --> 14:20.730
During the war,
Japan allocated a sky-high budget

14:20.770 --> 14:23.190
to promote cyborg development.

14:23.230 --> 14:27.070
Did they tell you to become
Army property to foot the bill?

14:28.650 --> 14:31.820
There were large deposits
made to Mamuro's accounts.

14:31.870 --> 14:37.580
But after his murder,
someone withdrew all that money.

14:37.660 --> 14:39.370
What do you want?

14:39.420 --> 14:44.540
Major Kusanagi, of Unit 501 .
No criminal record.

14:44.590 --> 14:48.220
You work with the Army and Public Security
as a special consultant.

14:48.260 --> 14:51.550
You specialize in solving cybercrimes.

14:58.770 --> 15:02.600
l request that you track down the missing money
and analyze the coffin records.

15:02.650 --> 15:06.940
Since it's an official investigation,
you should get leave to go off-base.

15:06.980 --> 15:08.110
What's the pay?

15:08.190 --> 15:12.450
I'll give you the regular consulting fee,
as a civilian.

15:12.490 --> 15:14.370
That'll be an issue, you know.

15:14.410 --> 15:19.540
A soldier famous for his integrity being shot
to death in secret is a bigger issue.

15:29.590 --> 15:31.220
- Hey!
- How dare you?!

15:31.260 --> 15:36.100
Tomorrow morning,
l'll send you a liaison who'll double as a bodyguard.

15:36.140 --> 15:37.560
Think she's in?

15:37.600 --> 15:39.930
She's as in the dark as we are.

15:39.980 --> 15:42.980
If she wants to be free,
she'll have to find out the truth.

15:49.070 --> 15:51.650
Still don't want the 501 to investigate?

15:51.700 --> 15:55.160
Make one wrong move,
and our unit could get dissolved.

15:55.240 --> 15:57.330
Public Security offered me an assignment.

15:57.410 --> 15:58.660
Will you accept?

15:58.700 --> 16:00.120
Lend me a hand.

16:00.160 --> 16:03.670
lf you can't get it done alone,
you'll be at the end of the line.

16:03.750 --> 16:06.630
No one else will be able to protect you then.

16:06.670 --> 16:10.170
Being protected isn't what I learned to do here!

16:10.210 --> 16:12.300
l learned to make the most of my strengths!

16:14.930 --> 16:18.010
I'll grant permission for you to use Server 6.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.850
Thanks.

16:19.930 --> 16:21.930
Just don't forget the job l gave you.

16:29.070 --> 16:31.780
List the people working on the case.

16:31.820 --> 16:35.320
But this is clearly related to the LTC's mugging!

16:35.360 --> 16:39.200
We know he met up with the prostitute.
We need a warrant for her cust—

16:39.240 --> 16:42.700
lt's military jurisdiction!
You keep out of it!

16:42.790 --> 16:46.170
You just forget this case, you hear me?
That's an order!

16:49.630 --> 16:52.800
Then what's a special investigator even for, dammit?!

16:55.090 --> 16:58.140
"Mamuro was being followed."

16:59.180 --> 17:00.680
What?!

17:20.369 --> 17:23.250
- Hey!
- St-Stop right there!

17:39.640 --> 17:41.100
There you are!

17:50.570 --> 17:53.440
Well, if it isn't the little tomboy from the lab.

17:59.490 --> 18:03.290
The one who infiltrated me... is in that car...!

18:09.630 --> 18:11.880
You fool! That makes you a deserter!

18:17.170 --> 18:19.050
Stop, Raizo!

18:19.090 --> 18:21.090
All right, Kusanagi?

18:21.140 --> 18:23.050
lnstructor lbachi...

18:23.100 --> 18:27.730
Don't think you can do whatever you want
just because you were Mamuro's favorite!

18:27.770 --> 18:31.230
Your selfish actions put the whole unit in danger!

18:31.270 --> 18:35.230
That's enough!
l'll be the one to lecture her.

18:37.320 --> 18:40.410
That bitch only survived as a test subject.

18:45.870 --> 18:48.660
The number is a fake.
He's a slippery customer.

18:48.710 --> 18:52.000
We've proven there was an infiltrator, at least.

18:52.080 --> 18:53.840
What does Kurutsu say?

18:53.880 --> 18:55.340
"lgnore it."

18:57.050 --> 18:58.470
Is your prosthetic body acting up?

19:01.260 --> 19:02.840
I don't know.

19:02.930 --> 19:04.510
Goodness, another visitor.

19:04.600 --> 19:06.970
You've got a strange one here to see you.

19:11.020 --> 19:12.520
What is this?

19:17.280 --> 19:21.610
lt uses signal lights?
How old is this thing?

19:23.620 --> 19:24.870
Here, come with me.

19:37.510 --> 19:41.130
Construct your learning base yourself.

19:47.310 --> 19:49.180
Hello, nice to meet you!

19:49.230 --> 19:55.400
l'm an autonomous-follower logistics system—
a "Logistics Conveyer Machine".

19:55.480 --> 19:59.480
You're Section 9's "liaison
who'll double as a bodyguard"?

19:59.530 --> 20:02.490
Chief Aramaki calls me a "Logicoma"!

20:02.530 --> 20:07.080
You'll be receiving information through me,
Major Kusanagi.

20:07.160 --> 20:11.750
No synching. Explain things orally or as data.

20:11.790 --> 20:17.000
Um... Any Army case information on the group
identified as illicit arms dealers

20:17.040 --> 20:21.420
would be very useful to Chief Aramaki
in tracking down a mobile land mine!

20:21.510 --> 20:24.430
The Army? Arms dealers?

20:24.470 --> 20:25.930
Yes, sir!

20:29.060 --> 20:31.850
You disappear. l'll take it from here.

20:31.890 --> 20:34.390
Order acknowledged!

20:36.190 --> 20:37.690
Optical camouflage?

20:46.490 --> 20:48.370
Stay here and guard my bike.

20:48.410 --> 20:49.910
Right!

20:53.750 --> 20:57.790
Come on, walk straight!
Look, we're almost there.

21:04.010 --> 21:05.800
Hi there!

21:05.890 --> 21:06.800
Come on in.

21:06.840 --> 21:09.890
It's not even dinnertime,
and this guy's three sheets to the wind!

21:09.930 --> 21:12.220
Get him something cold, okay?

21:12.270 --> 21:15.640
Come on, get it together!
Sit straight!

21:28.200 --> 21:29.620
l fold.

21:29.660 --> 21:31.240
Gonna go hit the can.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.950
Hey, no fair!

21:33.000 --> 21:35.080
But you had a great hand!

21:41.170 --> 21:42.670
There.

21:49.010 --> 21:50.510
Warning! Warning!

21:50.600 --> 21:52.970
Someone approaching, extremely close!

21:55.850 --> 21:58.480
Don't move. Who sent you?!

22:17.540 --> 22:20.040
Were you the ones who killed Lt. Col. Mamuro?

22:20.080 --> 22:21.960
Huh? Are you Public Security?

22:22.000 --> 22:23.630
Answer me!

22:23.670 --> 22:29.680
First you check the Army database!
Code 24, Ops H2976...

22:29.720 --> 22:31.890
...code name Paz!

22:32.930 --> 22:34.640
You're undercover?!

22:35.680 --> 22:40.060
Yeah, the group l'm in with was hired for a hit.

22:40.100 --> 22:41.520
They said the target was a full cyborg

22:41.560 --> 22:44.570
and his cyberbrain had to be destroyed,
so we'd use mobile land mines.

22:44.610 --> 22:47.690
Three of 'em—and I'm talking military-grade.

22:47.740 --> 22:50.070
Lt. Col. Mamuro's murder?

22:50.160 --> 22:54.370
Who knows?
Apparently somebody beat our guys to it,

22:54.410 --> 22:56.580
and we let the mines get away.

22:56.620 --> 22:58.710
Where did the mines come from?

22:58.750 --> 23:00.920
Maneuver Area 6.

23:00.960 --> 23:05.590
That place is a joke.
Might as well set foxes to guard a henhouse.

23:07.420 --> 23:09.840
Feel like proving it with me?

23:11.890 --> 23:14.930
This ain't the best job,
but I can't just drop it.

23:15.010 --> 23:19.100
l'd be in danger,
and l'd cause trouble for my CO.

23:19.140 --> 23:21.270
ls your CO trustworthy?

23:22.690 --> 23:24.270
Used to be.

23:26.440 --> 23:27.940
l see.

23:29.650 --> 23:31.360
Thanks for your cooperation.

23:32.530 --> 23:35.450
l wish l had your freedom of movement.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.960
You can't analyze it?

23:48.010 --> 23:49.710
lt might just be noise.

24:09.530 --> 24:14.910
No full-body cyborg gets to leave
this organization and go independent.

24:14.950 --> 24:19.330
You're just a girl with
a little talent for cyber warfare.

24:19.410 --> 24:21.830
Mamuro's death was an inevitability.

24:21.910 --> 24:25.290
Don't step out of line, or I'll take you out.

24:26.590 --> 24:29.300
Kurutsu and lbachi can't shield you from me.

24:30.510 --> 24:32.010
An inevitability...

25:24.100 --> 25:26.480
Their security's a joke, all right.

25:39.780 --> 25:42.580
All that's left is to connect the dots...

25:42.620 --> 25:46.910
Look, l've got authorization!
And all l'm gonna do is ask questions!

25:46.960 --> 25:49.540
Take your complaints to the station.

25:49.590 --> 25:54.760
Where does he get off?
It ain't like I've never been deployed, dammit...

26:01.060 --> 26:03.510
This is bullshit!
They're not even he—

26:05.810 --> 26:10.020
Ah, sorry. I'm a special investigator
with the Niihama police.

26:10.060 --> 26:13.020
l was told l could find these two here.

26:13.070 --> 26:15.230
I have some questions for First Lieutenant Moto Seta

26:15.280 --> 26:17.700
and Captain Amuri Noto here—

26:17.740 --> 26:21.700
Thanks. You just connected some dots.

26:21.740 --> 26:27.620
And l see some others just connected.
How about showing yourself?

26:34.630 --> 26:36.960
Batou the Ranger?

26:37.050 --> 26:42.220
Long time no see.
Gotta say l didn't figure you for this one.

26:42.260 --> 26:43.810
What do you mean?

26:43.850 --> 26:48.640
The man you killed seven days ago
was a comrade of mine!

26:48.730 --> 26:51.440
I just got back to Japan three days ago.

26:51.480 --> 26:53.230
Oh, really?!

27:13.790 --> 27:19.340
I've told you your sleepless eye's weakness
is how easy it is to infiltrate.

27:19.420 --> 27:23.010
Still afraid of taking friendly
fire out in the jungle?

27:23.100 --> 27:25.600
l'm an electronic warfare specialist too!

27:25.640 --> 27:28.810
I can't believe you infiltrated me
in the middle of a fight!

27:28.850 --> 27:32.100
You're just about the only one who'd infiltrate me.

27:32.480 --> 27:35.150
So, why are you after me?

27:35.190 --> 27:36.480
Don't play dumb!

27:36.530 --> 27:39.780
You're the one who got this place's
mobile land mines!

27:44.240 --> 27:45.870
What the hell?!

27:53.960 --> 27:55.040
Wait!

27:55.090 --> 27:56.880
Don't shoot! Run!

28:08.640 --> 28:10.140
Don't!

28:36.540 --> 28:38.500
Those guys aren't with you?!

28:38.550 --> 28:40.340
Seriously, what are you talking about?

28:40.380 --> 28:41.920
Hey, look!

28:46.550 --> 28:47.760
They found us!

28:48.930 --> 28:50.430
They want to eliminate us here.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.600
And their excuse will be
a "training exercise accident"?

28:52.640 --> 28:55.270
I can't stop 'em with this puny gun!

28:58.320 --> 29:00.190
We'll just have to run!

29:05.740 --> 29:06.860
Now we climb!

29:06.910 --> 29:07.950
Climb this?!

29:08.030 --> 29:10.080
Damn straight!

29:10.120 --> 29:12.620
We'll hold them off, so get moving!

29:12.700 --> 29:14.710
- Okay, fine.
- Hello!

29:14.750 --> 29:16.250
What's that?!

29:18.340 --> 29:19.880
We're surrounded.

29:22.710 --> 29:24.050
I told you, move it!

29:24.090 --> 29:25.970
I know, I know!

29:35.890 --> 29:36.810
Get in!

29:56.500 --> 29:58.500
l thought you "couldn't drop it"?

29:58.580 --> 30:01.000
This makes a nice change of pace.

30:19.980 --> 30:23.110
You asked the military police for help?

30:23.150 --> 30:26.280
To escort a suspect.

30:26.320 --> 30:27.820
What's this about?

30:34.700 --> 30:36.540
This makes no sense.

30:36.580 --> 30:42.130
Firstly: the missing money went to
your account, Major Kusanagi.

30:42.170 --> 30:46.380
Secondly: the bullet you fired
on the mobile land mine at the graveyard

30:46.470 --> 30:49.630
matched the one that killed Lt. Col. Mamuro.

30:49.680 --> 30:53.890
Seven days ago,
a prostitute here in town was shot to death.

30:53.930 --> 30:56.720
The bullet matched the one
that killed Mamuro.

30:56.810 --> 31:00.060
Mamuro had met with her,
and according to the other working girls,

31:00.100 --> 31:03.360
he was asking questions about one of her clients.

31:03.400 --> 31:06.860
Seven days ago, one of my fellow Rangers

31:06.900 --> 31:09.530
was killed by a mobile land mine,
along with his family.

31:12.450 --> 31:15.910
He'd been in contact with Mamuro, too.

31:15.990 --> 31:21.080
And when l traced the land mine to its source,
it led me to the major here.

31:21.120 --> 31:24.340
By the way, she says
she got back to Japan three days ago,

31:24.380 --> 31:27.000
but Immigration records say it was seven days ago.

31:27.050 --> 31:29.920
The three mines my group was supposed to use

31:30.010 --> 31:33.180
were the same model as the one Section 9
dug up at the graveyard.

31:33.220 --> 31:37.260
Assuming one of those three was buried
and another killed the Ranger,

31:37.350 --> 31:39.600
there's one more left unaccounted for.

31:39.680 --> 31:43.730
At the moment,
all the clues point to you murdering Mamuro

31:43.770 --> 31:46.110
and stealing his money.

31:47.570 --> 31:53.360
Right after l landed,
l got a message and an attaché case from him.

31:53.410 --> 31:58.450
I'm sorry, Major Kusanagi.
I doubt I'll be in this world much longer.

32:00.160 --> 32:03.080
I wanted to get justice.

32:03.130 --> 32:07.090
l've left your recommendation in someone else's care.

32:07.130 --> 32:12.130
You're the most promising squad member l know.
l wish you luck.

32:12.550 --> 32:17.470
In the case, I found data
on an internal weapons exportation racket...

32:17.930 --> 32:19.770
...and this gun.

32:19.810 --> 32:24.310
You've moved a lot of money in the past few days.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.980
Who are you sending it to?

32:27.020 --> 32:30.650
The widow of the man who raised me.

32:30.690 --> 32:35.990
She's taken care of me since l was little,
but she's in a nursing home now.

32:36.070 --> 32:38.080
What's her name?

32:39.870 --> 32:42.330
What is this woman's name?

32:55.340 --> 32:57.470
Phantom pain, huh?

32:57.510 --> 33:02.100
Even after you mechanize your body,
your brain never forgets the original.

33:02.140 --> 33:03.850
Pain in the ass.

33:03.890 --> 33:06.190
I don't have an "original" body.

33:06.230 --> 33:07.610
What?

33:07.650 --> 33:11.480
Have you heard of Doctor Bakeru's
emergency medicine system?

33:11.530 --> 33:13.940
That thing where someone
with a full prosthetic body

33:13.990 --> 33:16.860
uses their life-support system
on somebody else?

33:17.990 --> 33:23.370
The person who raised me used it on me
while I was in my mother's womb.

33:28.460 --> 33:34.220
Supposedly a chemical weapon killed
a large number of civilians way back when.

33:34.260 --> 33:38.050
A pregnant woman and the man assumed
to be her husband both died.

33:38.090 --> 33:40.050
We don't even know their names.

33:40.100 --> 33:43.720
Because someone with that particular lifesaver
happened to be on the scene,

33:43.770 --> 33:46.390
the fetus's brain alone survived.

33:46.440 --> 33:49.400
You're saying you were made a full cyborg at birth?!

33:49.480 --> 33:52.400
I lack any memory of a body.

33:52.480 --> 33:58.240
So perhaps you could call this "ghost pain",
created by false memories.

34:04.660 --> 34:08.000
This is surveillance footage from Maneuver Area 6.

34:08.040 --> 34:10.710
Your subordinate is in it.

34:10.750 --> 34:13.050
If you refuse to hand her over,

34:13.090 --> 34:16.590
I'll present you with a summons signed by
the Defense Minister himself.

34:16.679 --> 34:20.429
I'll submit a written report at a later date.
I can't hand her over.

34:21.260 --> 34:23.100
Vixen.

34:23.139 --> 34:24.929
l'll make you regret this.

34:32.610 --> 34:36.739
That's Shujiro Kanzaki.
He's in charge of Maneuver Area 6,

34:36.780 --> 34:39.610
and he leads a team of special agents.

34:39.659 --> 34:42.909
He's also the Army's dirty go-between with
the Ministry of Defense.

34:42.949 --> 34:46.290
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

34:49.460 --> 34:50.960
What's wrong?

34:52.170 --> 34:53.710
It's nothing.

35:07.560 --> 35:12.650
lt's been empty from the beginning?
Then where's the gun?!

35:12.730 --> 35:16.110
Why did I think there were
whistle-blowing documents in it?!

35:16.150 --> 35:17.650
And the lieutenant colonel...?

35:36.420 --> 35:37.840
What's real?

35:38.260 --> 35:39.800
What's the truth?

35:46.720 --> 35:48.520
Where's the lieutenant colonel's cyberbrain?

35:52.940 --> 35:54.190
Wait, Kusanagi.

35:54.230 --> 35:56.650
Calm down.

35:56.690 --> 36:02.530
The hardware Kurutsu had me analyze
matched his Net synch pattern.

36:02.570 --> 36:05.950
He and I were infected
with the same virus, weren't we?

36:05.990 --> 36:08.540
With something hypothesized
to be a cyber-virus.

36:08.620 --> 36:11.040
We speculate that it's
a self-destructing Stuxnet-type

36:11.120 --> 36:14.000
which causes unknown dysfunction.

36:14.040 --> 36:18.130
"Unknown dysfunction"...
You mean false memories.

36:18.170 --> 36:19.800
It was purely a hypothesis.

36:19.840 --> 36:22.880
At least, until we checked into your behavior.

36:22.970 --> 36:25.970
I just got back to Japan today, you know.

36:26.260 --> 36:28.180
True enough.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.810
When did I come back to Japan?

36:30.850 --> 36:34.060
Approximately 1 80 hours ago.
In other words, seven days.

36:34.100 --> 36:39.570
And yet you continue to claim it was
another day altogether.

36:39.610 --> 36:40.900
Route of transmission?

36:40.990 --> 36:43.360
lt must have been contact with Mamuro's cyberbrain.

36:43.410 --> 36:46.240
Which is still with his prosthetic body.

36:47.240 --> 36:50.080
His coffin was a trap.

36:50.160 --> 36:54.040
And the records Public Security got of his
burial show no signs of tampering.

36:56.040 --> 36:57.920
So that's how it is...

36:59.710 --> 37:01.840
Logicoma, synch with me.

37:01.880 --> 37:03.340
Are you sure?

37:03.380 --> 37:08.680
Just get on with it.
Record my field of vision and play it back in real time.

37:08.720 --> 37:10.890
Roger!

37:13.140 --> 37:15.350
I see things that shouldn't be there.

37:23.190 --> 37:26.110
I don't see things that should be there.

37:50.640 --> 37:52.470
Here, the whole time...?

37:54.140 --> 37:55.430
"Special agent" "The LTC is innocent"

38:14.660 --> 38:17.620
This is a warrant for Major Kusanagi's arrest.

38:19.960 --> 38:22.170
Surrender her immediately.

38:23.130 --> 38:24.550
"Special agent" "The LTC is innocent"

38:45.820 --> 38:48.490
The records weren't tampered with.

38:48.530 --> 38:52.830
They just buried the truth under a lie.

39:27.070 --> 39:28.570
l've found it...

39:29.950 --> 39:32.410
My reality.

39:41.330 --> 39:42.830
Drive.

39:53.050 --> 39:56.600
The lieutenant colonel
came to you to blow the whistle.

39:56.680 --> 40:00.270
Didn't he, Mr. Sadamoto, νice-Minister of Defense?

40:00.350 --> 40:01.390
Yes.

40:01.440 --> 40:03.600
But you ordered a cover-up.

40:03.690 --> 40:05.900
Because it couldn't be made public!

40:05.940 --> 40:08.530
We ignored treaties and sold arms to
Third World countries during the war

40:08.570 --> 40:11.900
to relieve its financial burden on us.

40:11.950 --> 40:14.410
That's governmental weapons smuggling!

40:14.450 --> 40:17.620
- Harimadara was at the center of it,
and as their security official,
- νice-Minister, what's the matter?

40:17.700 --> 40:20.450
- Lt. Col. Mamuro found out about the illegal trade.
- νice-Minister!

40:20.500 --> 40:21.460
What is it?

40:21.500 --> 40:23.040
- Do you realize how much
- He's in danger!

40:23.080 --> 40:25.960
the missile business has helped
our country's finances?!

40:26.040 --> 40:28.550
The lieutenant colonel learned of
your cover-up and investigated.

40:28.590 --> 40:32.590
The prostitute you frequented.
The Ranger who escorted you.

40:32.630 --> 40:36.600
When he got info from them,
he decided to blow the whistle on you.

40:36.640 --> 40:40.220
So you ordered Captain Kanzaki to kill him.

40:40.270 --> 40:42.810
l just ordered him to solve the situation!

40:42.890 --> 40:47.610
Yes, a few people suffered,
but I don't know who killed Mamuro.

40:47.650 --> 40:50.480
Hell, maybe he really was mugged.

40:50.530 --> 40:52.320
You claim even you don't know?

40:52.400 --> 40:54.150
No, and I don't want to!

40:54.200 --> 40:57.820
That arms dealing will be purged
during restructuring anyway,

40:57.870 --> 41:00.990
and we're deliberating next-generation weapons
to replace missiles.

41:01.080 --> 41:06.170
But this mess kills the job Harimadara has
lined up for when I leave office!

41:06.250 --> 41:09.840
You're quite the chatterbox.
A desire to confess?

41:09.880 --> 41:14.930
Maybe so. Either way, you'll never tell anyone!

41:21.470 --> 41:23.310
Stop!

41:25.230 --> 41:26.770
Someone help!

41:38.320 --> 41:40.490
Should've blown him away.

41:40.540 --> 41:45.210
Wasn't being more than a killing machine
the whole point of getting out?

41:45.290 --> 41:48.710
ln the end, l had no place to go.

41:48.790 --> 41:52.840
They traced us through the remote control.
They're coming.

41:52.880 --> 41:56.050
You go on. They're mine.

41:56.130 --> 41:57.840
There are two of them.

41:57.890 --> 42:01.220
Fine with me.
We'll see who's the better killer.

42:03.640 --> 42:05.230
Take care.

42:05.270 --> 42:07.560
You too.

42:07.600 --> 42:14.190
I hate to say it, but they're not
the only ones to benefit from his death.

42:14.240 --> 42:16.570
Yes. Thank you.

43:21.470 --> 43:24.140
You're the ones who killed the lieutenant colonel!

43:55.710 --> 44:01.590
I warned you that if you stepped out of line,
I'd take you out.

45:39.900 --> 45:41.520
That's enough of that.

45:46.450 --> 45:50.120
You've reached your limit, Kusanagi.

45:57.000 --> 46:01.630
Raizo and Ibachi were luring the enemy here
with the money as bait.

46:03.670 --> 46:06.470
We've eliminated six spies.

46:06.550 --> 46:08.130
That's plenty.

46:08.180 --> 46:15.560
Kanzaki funneled money into Mamuro's account,
l moved it... and you used it.

46:15.600 --> 46:17.140
That's right.

46:17.230 --> 46:22.110
The gun used on the prostitute was
the beginning of the enemy plot.

46:22.150 --> 46:28.570
Blowing up the Ranger, the phony bribery...
All the blame was placed on Mamuro.

46:33.370 --> 46:37.080
And he intended to bring
the νice-Minister down with him.

46:37.120 --> 46:39.330
It was the worst possible choice.

46:39.420 --> 46:46.130
Unit 501 would have gone on the Army purge list
in retaliation for the scandal.

46:46.170 --> 46:50.640
So you let him die. All of you.

47:10.870 --> 47:15.620
lf it weren't for the memory virus,
maybe we could have saved him.

47:15.660 --> 47:18.870
But as things stood, the only option was to secure

47:18.960 --> 47:24.170
Mamuro's cyberbrain, the mine,
and the money before he got blown up.

47:29.180 --> 47:36.390
But what neither we
nor the enemy accounted for was you.

47:36.430 --> 47:42.190
As soon as I arrived and got the data,
I went after the lieutenant colonel.

47:56.080 --> 47:59.250
And you were infected by his cyberbrain.

48:10.170 --> 48:16.050
Even as you gathered the evidence,
you were continually losing memories.

48:16.100 --> 48:18.060
"The LTC is innocent"

48:20.430 --> 48:23.440
What organization developed the virus?

48:23.520 --> 48:27.440
Unclear. All we know is that
a foreign broker brought it here

48:27.480 --> 48:31.360
and that people call it "Fire-Starter".

48:31.400 --> 48:35.240
Was it a foreign power
that cooked up the scandal?

48:35.280 --> 48:38.790
Our enemy is the global
military-industrial complex itself.

48:38.830 --> 48:41.790
What would dragging down
one vice-minister accomplish?

48:41.870 --> 48:45.750
Did you take the disc he left me?

48:45.790 --> 48:47.250
l did that to protect you.

48:47.290 --> 48:49.920
You used me as bait for the enemy!

48:49.960 --> 48:51.920
l did that to protect the organization.

48:51.970 --> 48:54.470
Why did you stand back and watch him die?

48:54.510 --> 48:56.930
l did that to protect myself.

49:05.980 --> 49:11.780
You stick with me, Kusanagi.
I'll build a future for you.

49:20.950 --> 49:23.160
The pain is gone now.

49:27.630 --> 49:29.960
Section 9 and the review committee

49:30.000 --> 49:33.670
have formally cleared Lt. Col. Mamuro of suspicion.

49:33.760 --> 49:38.760
Thus, as his recommendation was renewed
by a third party, we will implement it.

49:38.800 --> 49:43.270
Due to your excellent record, we also grant you
the post-reorganization major rank.

49:43.310 --> 49:46.980
In addition, in accordance with the will
of your late legal guardian,

49:47.020 --> 49:49.310
you'll receive a testamentary trust.

49:50.820 --> 49:53.440
It's an inheritance from the person who raised you.

49:53.490 --> 49:56.360
A portion of it is earmarked for
the purchase of your prosthetic body.

49:56.450 --> 49:59.280
Which means that your body is now your property,

49:59.330 --> 50:01.370
and is outside Army jurisdiction.

50:04.160 --> 50:06.540
You're quite sure about this?

50:06.580 --> 50:08.040
The virus may be an unknown,

50:08.130 --> 50:11.340
but we've identified the architecture
of the false memories.

50:11.380 --> 50:13.000
Do it.

50:13.050 --> 50:16.380
νery well. We'll attempt memory eradication.

51:04.310 --> 51:05.930
Will you go?

51:06.020 --> 51:07.270
Yes.

51:07.350 --> 51:09.940
Make sure to pay your respects to your parents.

51:11.690 --> 51:13.190
Thanks.

51:21.490 --> 51:23.030
I'm going.

51:44.510 --> 51:46.470
We'll find a replacement.

51:54.190 --> 51:56.150
Want a ride?

51:56.230 --> 51:59.400
Consider it my thanks for telling us
the location of Mamuro's cyberbrain.

51:59.450 --> 52:01.150
I'll take the bus.

52:01.240 --> 52:03.160
Then l'll just give you the results.

52:03.240 --> 52:07.790
Captain Kanzaki was replaced.
Mr. Sadamoto will be tried in closed court.

52:07.830 --> 52:12.000
I promise to make the lieutenant colonel's
findings public one day.

52:12.080 --> 52:18.840
l see. By the way—are you the one
he gave my recommendation to?

52:18.880 --> 52:22.840
Hard to say.
A man in my position gets a lot of those.

52:22.930 --> 52:24.760
ln fact, one of them outlined plans

52:24.800 --> 52:29.470
to create a new special unit within
the international rescue team.

52:29.520 --> 52:34.270
l'd like someone who's got experience
as a special consultant.

52:34.310 --> 52:39.480
lntriguing, but l don't want to work
under a man who digs up people's graves.

52:39.530 --> 52:43.360
You dug up something even deeper.

52:43.450 --> 52:47.280
If you're serious about going independent,
you should have your own team.

52:47.330 --> 52:55.540
The regulations say a unit needs
a minimum of one commander and six members.

52:55.580 --> 52:57.170
l'll keep that in mind.

52:59.510 --> 53:04.130
May it be a team not for defense of self or state,
but for taking the offensive.

57:30.280 --> 57:32.610
Six people, huh?

57:32.650 --> 57:35.150
Hmm, whom shall l scout...?

57:37.594 --> 57:44.594
A Team Nanban (594mgnav) Release

57:45.305 --> 57:51.333
