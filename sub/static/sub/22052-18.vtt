WEBVTT

00:05.533 --> 00:08.533
Keeping
Up with the Kardashians...

00:08.533 --> 00:10.900
Alexa!
I'm pregnant.

00:10.900 --> 00:12.900
>> ALEXA: Oh, my God.
>> KHLOE: I think I'm in a state

00:12.900 --> 00:15.233
of shock.
I almost can't believe it.

00:15.233 --> 00:17.233
But a good shock.
>> TRISTAN: We have an

00:17.233 --> 00:19.233
announcement.
KoKo, want to throw the hammer

00:19.233 --> 00:22.200
down?
>> KHLOE: We're having a baby!

00:22.200 --> 00:25.734
>> KRIS: No way!

00:25.734 --> 00:28.066
>> KHLOE: Yes, we are.
>> KRIS: Khloe!

00:28.066 --> 00:34.200
I'm so happy for you!
Oh, my God!

00:34.200 --> 00:36.667
Keeping Up
with the Kardashians...

00:36.667 --> 00:38.667
>> KOURTNEY: So I've been
thinking about freezing my eggs.

00:38.667 --> 00:40.667
>> KIM: Are you serious?
You want another kid?

00:40.667 --> 00:42.667
>> KOURTNEY: What if I do,
though?

00:42.667 --> 00:44.500
I don't know what I want.
>> SARAH: I mean, I understand

00:44.500 --> 00:46.467
why couples get divorced over
IVF.

00:46.467 --> 00:49.333
Because your hormones go, like,
up to here, and then they go all

00:49.333 --> 00:53.400
the way down.
>> KIM: You kind of look like

00:53.400 --> 00:56.133
Miranda Priestly.
>> KRIS : Stop.

00:56.133 --> 00:58.767
>> KOURTNEY: My name is Miranda.
>> KRIS: My name is Miranda.

00:58.767 --> 01:01.033
>> KHLOE: My name is Miranda.
>> KRIS : I really

01:01.033 --> 01:07.000
can't take the incompetence of
these morons.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.934
>> KIM: Oh, my God.
TMZ just got a tip that you're

01:08.934 --> 01:10.867
pregnant.
I think it's just really

01:10.867 --> 01:12.734
unfortunate for Khloe 'cause
she's not ready to talk about

01:12.734 --> 01:14.734
it.
>> KHLOE: You want to tell

01:14.734 --> 01:17.467
people yourself, but just, like,
people take all of that away

01:17.467 --> 01:19.367
from you.

01:24.066 --> 01:27.600
>> KIM: I am so tired.
I cannot get up this early.

01:27.600 --> 01:30.200
>> KHLOE: How early?
>> KIM: Saint was up at, like,

01:30.200 --> 01:32.433
4:30.
>> KHLOE: What the hell was he

01:32.433 --> 01:35.900
doing at 4:30?
>> KIM: Crying and saying,

01:35.900 --> 01:39.567
"Baba, baba.
Downstairs. Go get."

01:39.567 --> 01:42.367
>> KHLOE: Aw.
He's so cute, though.

01:42.367 --> 01:45.700
So, you know we're having the
baby in Cleveland.

01:45.700 --> 01:47.800
>> KIM: Yeah. How is that gonna
happen?

01:47.800 --> 01:50.000
What if you're, like...?
>> KHLOE: I have my doctor.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
>> KIM: What?
>> KHLOE: She's flying to

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Cleveland to deliver the baby.
>> KIM: What if it's an

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
emergency and something happens?
>> KHLOE: No. Stop saying these

01:56.000 --> 01:57.834
things.
>> KIM: You have to be prepared.

01:57.834 --> 01:59.667
>> KHLOE:
Don't scare me.

01:59.667 --> 02:01.700
I don't have another option.
>> KIM: And then are you gonna,

02:01.700 --> 02:06.233
like, eat your placenta?
>> KHLOE: I'm gonna eat it in

02:06.233 --> 02:08.066
pills.
>> KIM: Yeah, so then, you need

02:08.066 --> 02:09.934
the placenta person to come
while it's still fresh.

02:09.934 --> 02:12.667
>> KHLOE: That's not just, like,
a... a thing at the hospital?

02:12.667 --> 02:14.900
>> KIM: No.
You need to find a placenta

02:14.900 --> 02:17.667
company.
And then, like, they knock on

02:17.667 --> 02:20.100
the door when you're, like, just
giving birth, and they're like,

02:20.100 --> 02:23.734
"The placenta pickup's here."
>> KHLOE: How do I know that

02:23.734 --> 02:25.734
they're giving me back my
placenta?

02:25.734 --> 02:27.734
>> KIM: You don't.
But, like, with Saint, my

02:27.734 --> 02:30.533
placenta was double the size.
It was really oddly big.

02:30.533 --> 02:33.000
>> KHLOE: Ew.
>> KIM: And so, she gave me two

02:33.000 --> 02:37.033
jars.
>> KHLOE: What are your jars of?

02:37.033 --> 02:39.166
>> KIM: Like, purple pills, and
it's, like, you pick a grape

02:39.166 --> 02:41.166
flavor or whatever.
>> KHLOE: No, you're lying now.

02:41.166 --> 02:43.166
>> KIM: Yeah, I swear.
>> KHLOE: No.

02:43.166 --> 02:44.867
>> KIM: Yeah.
>> KHLOE: Grape

02:44.867 --> 02:47.033
Placenta?
>> KIM: Yeah.

02:47.033 --> 02:49.567
>> KHLOE: What?!
>> KIM: Mm-hmm.

02:49.567 --> 03:14.734
>> KHLOE: Ew.
♪ ♪

03:14.734 --> 03:19.633
>> KHLOE: Hey.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.667
>> KIM: Yeah.
I said, I...

03:21.667 --> 03:23.667
Well, I started off saying
that this--

03:23.667 --> 03:26.700
"I love you a lot like a sister,
and this conversation's really

03:26.700 --> 03:31.900
hard for me to have, but, you
know, I just think that you've

03:31.900 --> 03:38.133
outgrown your position here."
She's like, "I totally get it,

03:38.133 --> 03:40.800
and I totally respect you, and
you've taught me everything, and

03:40.800 --> 03:44.433
I'm so grateful I've been with
you for five years."

03:44.433 --> 03:49.700
My assistant Stephanie and I
have decided to part ways.

03:49.700 --> 03:52.367
She wanted a different role, and
I was moving in a different

03:52.367 --> 03:55.867
direction, so I felt like, you
know, for both of us, it just

03:55.867 --> 03:58.400
wasn't the right fit anymore.
She's, like, really been there

03:58.400 --> 04:00.467
for me, you know?
And so, I said, "I love you so

04:00.467 --> 04:02.700
much."
And I was like, "Maybe this is

04:02.700 --> 04:05.100
good to, like, push you to
figure out what you want to do."

04:05.100 --> 04:07.567
Like, it was, like...
It ended, like, really well.

04:07.567 --> 04:11.066
Like, she knew that she needed
this time, and she knew it,

04:11.066 --> 04:13.066
like, wasn't working.
Totally.

04:13.066 --> 04:15.600
Yeah.
All right.

04:15.600 --> 04:18.633
Love you.
Bye.

04:20.734 --> 04:22.734
Oh, my God.
TMZ just got a tip that you're

04:22.734 --> 04:26.200
pregnant.
>> KHLOE: Me?

04:26.200 --> 04:27.834
>> KIM: "Khloe, too.
Just a heads-up.

04:27.834 --> 04:29.734
We're getting tips that Khloe is
pregnant, as well.

04:29.734 --> 04:32.000
I think it's just the buzz, but
just a heads-up here."

04:32.000 --> 04:34.600
Tracy just wrote back question
mark, question mark, question

04:34.600 --> 04:38.567
mark.

04:38.567 --> 04:40.567
>> TRACY: Hey.
>> KHLOE: Hey.

04:40.567 --> 04:43.233
>> TRACY: So, they're not gonna
do anything yet. It's...

04:43.233 --> 04:47.266
He's just like, "We're hearing
buzz about it."

04:47.266 --> 04:51.600
>> KHLOE: So far, TMZ has not
published the article, but I am

04:51.600 --> 04:54.800
just mad because there's so many
risks involved when you're newly

04:54.800 --> 04:57.633
pregnant.
And if the doctor's telling me

04:57.633 --> 05:00.967
not to announce anything until a
specific time, I am respecting

05:00.967 --> 05:03.900
that, and I just hate that
everyone is prying and so nosey.

05:03.900 --> 05:07.000
It's super frustrating.
>> TRACY: If it gets to the

05:07.000 --> 05:09.100
point where they're definitely
gonna do something, I'll let you

05:09.100 --> 05:11.200
know.
>> KHLOE: Okay.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.333
>> TRACY: But I think for now,
they're just beginning to sort

05:13.333 --> 05:15.700
of hear about it, and so, I'm
sure they're gonna start poking

05:15.700 --> 05:17.700
around.
>> KHLOE: Okay.

05:17.700 --> 05:20.367
At the moment, I've only told my
immediate family and friends,

05:20.367 --> 05:22.533
and that's what I'm gonna keep
it to right now.

05:22.533 --> 05:25.700
Can't believe all these rumor...
Like, where do they come from?

05:25.700 --> 05:27.934
And, like...
I just don't understand how

05:27.934 --> 05:31.000
everything happens.
Do you?

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
>> KIM: Yeah, I think people
just talk.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.633
>> KHLOE:
I only have a few hours to

05:35.633 --> 05:37.700
finish this puzzle.
>> KIM: I do not like puzzles

05:37.700 --> 05:39.367
like this.
This is a really hard one.

05:39.367 --> 05:40.900
>> KHLOE: Yeah, it's like...
>> KIM: This is, like, for

05:40.900 --> 05:43.066
90-year-olds.
Like, this is what you do when

05:43.066 --> 05:47.333
you're really old.
Is this, like, a rabbit or a

05:47.333 --> 05:49.333
cheetah?
>> NORTH: Cheetah.

05:49.333 --> 05:51.233
>> KIM: Cheetah. Yes!

05:52.934 --> 05:56.934
>> KHLOE: I watch Kim Kardashian
and I text

05:56.934 --> 05:59.533
Kim.
I go, "You got to watch this."

05:59.533 --> 06:01.367
It was so good.
Going through Kim's whole style

06:01.367 --> 06:03.333
evolution-- it was really...
>> KIM: Yeah, I had no idea they

06:03.333 --> 06:05.233
were doing that.
It was really cute.

06:05.233 --> 06:07.700
>> KOURTNEY: I don't watch TV.
>> KHLOE: Like, no one cares.

06:07.700 --> 06:10.967
You don't get an award 'cause
you watch less TV.

06:10.967 --> 06:13.300
>> KOURTNEY: I do, 'cause I'm
winning in life.

06:13.300 --> 06:15.100
>> KIM: You got to, like, stay
relevant.

06:15.100 --> 06:17.100
>> KHLOE: You got to stay
relevant.

06:17.100 --> 06:20.000
>> KOURTNEY: Um, so I've been
thinking about freezing my eggs.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
>> KIM: Are you serious?
You want another kid?

06:22.000 --> 06:23.834
>> KOURTNEY: What if I do,
though?

06:23.834 --> 06:26.367
I don't know what I want.
What if I want a kid in the next

06:26.367 --> 06:28.300
ten years?
Wouldn't you rather have the

06:28.300 --> 06:31.166
insurance, like, sitting...
like, sitting there?

06:31.166 --> 06:35.066
>> KIM: Well, if you have a kid
when you're pushing 50, then...

06:35.066 --> 06:37.066
>> KOURTNEY: Janet Jackson just
did it.

06:37.066 --> 06:39.500
>> KIM: Yeah, but...
Who would you have a kid with?

06:39.500 --> 06:41.500
>> KOURTNEY: I don't know.
>> KHLOE: She does.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.500
Look at that smile.
>> KOURTNEY: No, I don't.

06:43.500 --> 06:45.200
>> KIM: Wouldn't you just say,
"Hey, Scott, give me your

06:45.200 --> 06:47.200
sperm," and they take it in a
turkey baster, and they stick it

06:47.200 --> 06:49.834
up you and squishy?
>> KOURTNEY: I don't need a baby

06:49.834 --> 06:51.934
to have a baby.
I have three kids.

06:51.934 --> 06:55.200
I'm saying if I am, like, in
love, and the person wants to

06:55.200 --> 06:57.367
have a kid, and...?
>> KHLOE: So you're thinking

06:57.367 --> 06:59.433
about a younger guy.
>> KOURTNEY: What are you

06:59.433 --> 07:01.433
talking about?!
>> KHLOE: I'm just trying to...

07:01.433 --> 07:02.867
>> KIM: I get it.
>> KHLOE: ...see if I can get it

07:02.867 --> 07:04.400
out of you.
>> KOURTNEY: If I wanted to have

07:04.400 --> 07:08.300
it with my situation right this
second, I would take out my IUD,

07:08.300 --> 07:11.834
and I would get to work.
>> KHLOE: Ugh. Get to work.

07:11.834 --> 07:13.667
>> KOURTNEY: But I don't need...
That's-- right now, I'm good.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.667
>> KHLOE: Good.
>> KIM: Got it.

07:15.667 --> 07:17.333
>> KHLOE: Got it.
>> KOURTNEY: Okay?

07:17.333 --> 07:19.467
>> KHLOE: This is if you're in
love and want to fulfill the

07:19.467 --> 07:21.467
man's dream of a baby.
>> KIM: Mm-hmm.

07:21.467 --> 07:25.834
>> KOURTNEY: Yup. What if I want
my love to come into the world?

07:25.834 --> 07:28.834
Is that gross to you?

07:28.834 --> 07:34.400
>> KHLOE: It's so weird that
babies are born.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.900
>> KIM: Mmm, my favorite girl.
Who's my favorite girl?

07:36.900 --> 07:40.700
>> NORTH: Me!
>> KRIS: Hi.

07:40.700 --> 07:42.734
>> KIM: Hi.
>> KRIS: What are you doing?

07:42.734 --> 07:44.767
>> KIM: Nothing.

07:44.767 --> 07:46.767
>> KRIS: Ah. No?
>> KIM: What are you doing?

07:46.767 --> 07:50.867
>> KRIS: Just... trying to get
all my work done so that I can

07:50.867 --> 07:53.834
go to this little meeting that I
have to do.

07:53.834 --> 07:56.266
So, I have a question.
>> KIM: Yeah.

07:56.266 --> 07:58.266
>> KRIS: Your hair looks
fantastic.

07:58.266 --> 08:00.266
>> KIM: Thank you.
>> KRIS: So who did it?

08:00.266 --> 08:02.266
>> KIM: Chris Appleton.
>> KRIS: He did?

08:02.266 --> 08:04.266
>> KIM: Mm-hmm.
>> KRIS: I don't know.

08:04.266 --> 08:07.033
I'm feeling like, I wanted to
dye my hair blond my entire

08:07.033 --> 08:10.100
life.
>> KIM: What?

08:10.100 --> 08:12.567
>> KRIS: People have always
thought that Kim and I look

08:12.567 --> 08:16.200
a lot alike, and that's always
worked out really well for me,

08:16.200 --> 08:19.333
because I get a lot of my
inspiration from some of the

08:19.333 --> 08:23.133
things that Kim does and wears.
And since the blonde looks so

08:23.133 --> 08:27.200
good on her-- I don't know--
maybe I can pull it off.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.200
It would have to be done.
'Cause I remember he did yours

08:29.200 --> 08:31.333
so gentle.
>> KIM: This took, like, 15

08:31.333 --> 08:33.033
hours.
>> KRIS: But look how long your

08:33.033 --> 08:34.700
hair is.
>> KIM: And your hair is never

08:34.700 --> 08:36.166
the same.
>> KRIS: Why? What happens when

08:36.166 --> 08:38.533
you're blonde?
>> KIM: It's, like, gummy.

08:38.533 --> 08:40.867
>> KRIS: Gummy?
>> KIM: It's, like, you can feel

08:40.867 --> 08:44.166
it, like, elasticky.
>> KRIS: Wow. I had no idea.

08:44.166 --> 08:46.400
>> KIM: But then it looks cute
when your roots grow in, but

08:46.400 --> 08:48.400
your roots are white, so they're
not gonna be...

08:48.400 --> 08:50.133
...you know, dark.

08:50.133 --> 08:52.066
>> KRIS: You're right.

08:58.100 --> 09:01.100
>> KOURTNEY: Khlo?
>> KHLOE: Yeah?

09:01.100 --> 09:03.266
>> KOURTNEY: Hi. How are you?
>> KHLOE: Oh, how's your penis?

09:03.266 --> 09:07.533
>> KOURTNEY: How's your penis?
>> KHLOE: I don't feel well.

09:07.533 --> 09:10.667
Literally, I, like, can't walk.
I told Tristan.

09:10.667 --> 09:12.800
He was like, "You haven't gone
anywhere with me in the last two

09:12.800 --> 09:15.433
weeks."
And I was like, "I'm so sorry."

09:15.433 --> 09:19.033
When you did your progesterone,
did anything ever happen to,

09:19.033 --> 09:22.333
like, the outside of you?
>> KIM: Like what?

09:22.333 --> 09:26.367
>> KHLOE: Like... it's so gross.
I was, like, thought I was,

09:26.367 --> 09:29.000
like, spotting, and I was like,
"Okay, that's so weird."

09:29.000 --> 09:30.834
And then the doctor was like,
"Where are you s...?

09:30.834 --> 09:32.834
Like, how much are you
spotting?"

09:32.834 --> 09:34.800
I was like, "Not a lot."
It's so weird.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.467
So, like, I realized it wasn't
from the inside.

09:37.467 --> 09:43.834
The outside is burned so bad
that it's bleeding.

09:43.834 --> 09:45.834
My doctor realized that I have
really low levels of

09:45.834 --> 09:49.333
progesterone, so I have to take
progesterone supplements two to

09:49.333 --> 09:51.767
three times a day, and it is
torture.

09:51.767 --> 09:53.767
>> KOURTNEY: Why are you even
doing this?

09:53.767 --> 09:56.367
>> KHLOE: Or else the baby is
gonna not be here.

09:56.367 --> 09:58.400
>> KOURTNEY: Why
>> KHLOE: Your body naturally

09:58.400 --> 10:00.433
produces progesterone.
If you don't...

10:00.433 --> 10:02.533
My body-- after...
>> KOURTNEY: And yours doesn't?

10:02.533 --> 10:06.867
>> KHLOE: Yeah, and after you
conceive, there's, I guess, a

10:06.867 --> 10:08.867
cyst that's, like, filled with
progesterone.

10:08.867 --> 10:12.633
It normally pops, she says.
And that keeps the sac in place.

10:12.633 --> 10:15.767
And if not, that's how you
miscarry, so she said, for sure

10:15.767 --> 10:17.600
I would have miscarried.
>> KOURTNEY: Can you text your

10:17.600 --> 10:19.433
doctor right now and see if you
can get the shots?

10:19.433 --> 10:21.266
>> KHLOE: It's... Yeah.
They're pills you put inside

10:21.266 --> 10:23.100
your... vagina.
>> KOURTNEY: Like a suppository

10:23.100 --> 10:25.100
thing?
>> KHLOE: Yeah.

10:25.100 --> 10:26.600
>> KIM: I did that for a while,
and then I was like, "I can't do

10:26.600 --> 10:28.600
this."
It comes out like clumpy cottage

10:28.600 --> 10:30.600
cheese.
>> KHLOE: Yeah.

10:30.600 --> 10:32.633
>> KIM: So, like, I'd have to,
like, time it out.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.633
>> KHLOE: No, no.
>> KIM: Like, put it in at

10:34.633 --> 10:37.066
night, or, like, have sex.
Then put it in.

10:37.066 --> 10:39.066
Can't have sex in the morning.
It's, like, the grossest that

10:39.066 --> 10:40.967
you've ever seen.
>> KHLOE: No, but I have to put

10:40.967 --> 10:42.967
it in 3:00 in the morning and
3:00 at night, 'cause my

10:42.967 --> 10:46.433
progesterone is so low.
I have to wake up and put it in.

10:46.433 --> 10:49.533
I have to, like, literally lay
my legs up, and I have to wait

10:49.533 --> 10:51.700
an hour.
This is not fun.

10:51.700 --> 10:57.100
Like, three more weeks of this.
I just feel sick every night,

10:57.100 --> 11:00.200

I'm meeting with Dr. Huang to
get some information about

11:51.567 --> 11:55.300
freezing my eggs.
I just want to be as educated as

11:55.300 --> 12:00.633

because I just need to really be

12:00.633 --> 12:03.333

want to do.

12:03.333 --> 12:05.700
>> HUANG: All right, let's go
over a couple of things.

12:05.700 --> 12:09.066
So these are eggs, okay?
So you-you've seen this before.

12:09.066 --> 12:11.166
So-- but it helps us understand
egg quality and egg quantity,

12:11.166 --> 12:13.100
and the difference between the
two.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.166
The orange ones are the good
ones, okay?

12:15.166 --> 12:17.700
So not all of a woman's eggs are
always good, okay?

12:17.700 --> 12:20.567
And our goal is to do everything
we can to get these eggs in the

12:20.567 --> 12:22.533
freezer.
Because if this is you as a

12:22.533 --> 12:25.066
38-year-old, watch what happens
when you're 39.

12:25.066 --> 12:28.633

>> KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm.
>> HUANG: All right, so as you

12:32.300 --> 12:34.200
get older, it's gonna be harder
and harder to find a good one,

12:34.200 --> 12:37.400
okay?
Today, if you have these six or

12:37.400 --> 12:40.000
seven eggs, I'm trying to get
these in the freezer.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.734
That way, even as you get older,
you'll always have these to fall

12:42.734 --> 12:45.200
back on.
To do this, we're gonna start

12:45.200 --> 12:48.834
you on shots for about eight to
12 days.

12:48.834 --> 12:51.433
These are FSH shots.

12:51.433 --> 12:53.633
fat
>> HUANG: You do get a little

12:53.633 --> 12:55.400
bit bloated.
You won't look bloated, but

12:55.400 --> 12:57.200
you'll feel bloated.

12:57.200 --> 13:00.867
all the steps involved in just
putting all the hormones in my

body and giving myself shots
every day...

13:04.367 --> 13:06.934
Look, I just really have to
think about it.

13:06.934 --> 13:11.800
Is there a way to do it natural,
or, like, a less kind of, like,

13:11.800 --> 13:14.066
estrogen, or is there... ?
>> HUANG: Yes, absolutely.

13:14.066 --> 13:17.433
The most natural way to do this
is to do no medications, okay?

13:17.433 --> 13:19.233

13:19.233 --> 13:21.066
one egg a month.

efficient, so instead, my hope

It's, like, putting too much

19:05.066 --> 19:09.667
because you're dating someone
younger, and-and you want him to

19:09.667 --> 19:12.500
know that all the options are
open if he wants to have kids,

19:12.500 --> 19:14.500
then you'll be able to have
kids.

I could just make it happen.

care to do this?"

>> SARAH: Like, for me, I'm so
happy I did it.

19:33.700 --> 19:35.900

I was so happy I did it even

I was like, "Okay, I'm doing

19:37.900 --> 19:39.633
this for a reason.
I'm doing this for a reason."

was doing the shots.

around anyone.

19:46.100 --> 19:50.300
depressed for, like, two months.
Like, I just felt so-- I did not

19:50.300 --> 19:53.100
feel myself.
I was super down after, because

19:53.100 --> 19:56.233
your hormones are-- go, like,
here, up to here, and then they

19:56.233 --> 19:58.800

they take all of it out.

rusted.
And I'm giving you this as your

38:42.000 --> 38:45.767
present for Friday.

ask you something.

Um, so, I was deciding about...
freezing my eggs.

>> KRIS: Yeah.
>> KOURTNEY: 'Cause I kind of

39:09.633 --> 39:13.367
had to... wrap my head around
it.

>> KRIS: Well, it's definitely
challenging, but it's really,

39:16.800 --> 39:19.734
obviously, worth it in the end.
>> KOURTNEY: But do I leave it

39:19.734 --> 39:22.834
in God's hands and if it's meant
to be, just, like, do it then,

39:22.834 --> 39:25.834
when... if I want to do that?
>> KRIS: No. Because the younger

39:25.834 --> 39:28.700
you are when you freeze your
eggs, the better the... your

39:28.700 --> 39:30.700
result is gonna be.
>> KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm.

39:30.700 --> 39:33.233
>> KRIS: If I were you, I would
really take advantage of the

39:33.233 --> 39:36.033
technology and give yourself
that insurance policy.

your own, yay.

I mean, I had Kendall at 40.
Kylie at 41.

39:43.967 --> 39:46.400
But I was lucky.
You know, some women don't make,

39:46.400 --> 39:50.133
you know, eggs that are viable
after they're 35.

39:50.133 --> 39:52.734
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.
>> KRIS: So you're too close to

39:52.734 --> 39:56.734
40 to not take advantage of this
window of opportunity.

39:56.734 --> 40:01.200
Get these eggs warmed up before,
you know, it becomes dormant, if

40:01.200 --> 40:04.667
you know what I mean.

40:04.667 --> 40:08.133
don't think I'm gonna do it
right now.

I just don't feel ready.

going on, and I just don't feel

like I'm ready to... like, my
body's ready to go through that

40:18.600 --> 40:22.166
right this minute.
And I think, in a few months, I

40:22.166 --> 40:25.200
can think about it again.
