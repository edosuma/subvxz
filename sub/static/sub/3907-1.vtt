10:49.316 --> 10:50.977
He had a thing for bottle service girls.

10:51.068 --> 10:53.309
Who the fuck doesn't? Think it's the uniform?

10:53.403 --> 10:54.813
No, it's they're hot and you're drunk.

10:54.905 --> 10:56.520
Hi, I'm Dashi.

10:56.615 --> 10:59.823
Ricky. What do you do?

11:00.661 --> 11:01.992
I'm in branding.

11:02.079 --> 11:04.240
-She's in branding.
-How about that?

11:08.585 --> 11:09.916
(LOUD MOANING)

11:11.505 --> 11:14.247
Ugh. Hey, come on, you son of a bitch.
Hurry the hell up.

11:17.678 --> 11:19.009
RICKY: Oh, shit.

11:20.556 --> 11:22.547
Oh. Oh, my bad, my bad.

11:22.641 --> 11:24.256
Oh, shit, you're Ricky Jerret.

11:24.726 --> 11:27.342
Yeah, man, I used to watch you
and your boy Roddney play at SC.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.018
Yeah? You a Trojan fan, too, huh?

11:29.106 --> 11:31.347
-Hell, no. Fuck the Trojans.
-All right.

11:31.441 --> 11:33.932
So, wait. Hang on. I guess the rules,
they don't apply to you, huh?

11:34.695 --> 11:36.276
You guys with your fucking self-entitlement.

11:36.363 --> 11:39.196
Y'all ain't nothing but a bunch of selfish,

11:39.283 --> 11:41.148
womanizing assholes.

11:41.243 --> 11:43.199
You know what I mean, player?

11:43.287 --> 11:44.777
No, I don't know what you mean.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.362
Come tell me, big country.

11:46.456 --> 11:47.957
Why don't you ask your boy Roddney?

11:48.125 --> 11:49.331
(GRUNTS)

11:49.585 --> 11:51.291
RICKY: Why don't you ask him,
punk motherfucker?

11:51.378 --> 11:53.118
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You ain't got no respect...

11:53.213 --> 11:54.373
Get the truck. Get the truck.

11:54.464 --> 11:55.590
You a SC fan now, ain't you?

11:55.674 --> 11:58.256
-Hey! Hey!
-You love SC.

11:58.343 --> 12:00.299
-No!No!No!
-Fuckthaﬂ Fuckthaﬂ

12:00.387 --> 12:02.548
Come on outside. Bring his ass outside.

12:02.639 --> 12:05.016
Yeah, bye.
Get ready to break out the checkbook.

12:05.100 --> 12:07.637
He had it coming.
He had that shit coming, man.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.593
Call your agent. Call Jason now.

12:09.688 --> 12:12.020
Where the fuck is Charles at? Call Jason.

12:17.321 --> 12:18.902

-Who?
-You are.

12:25.495 --> 12:27.156
Fucking... Jesus.

12:30.292 --> 12:31.281
-Ricky.
-RICKY: Jason.

12:32.461 --> 12:34.201
-What up?
-Got a little situation.

12:34.296 --> 12:36.036
Another one? How little?

12:36.131 --> 12:38.463
I let some punk-ass frat boy incite me,
so I dropped him.

12:39.551 --> 12:40.836
Oh, fuck. Why'd you do that?

12:40.928 --> 12:42.884
Why do I do anything?
Shitjust happens to me.

12:43.847 --> 12:46.213
All right, well, you know what,
I'm sure you had a good reason.

12:46.308 --> 12:48.890
Let me get on it,
but in the meantime, don't talk to anyone.

12:48.977 --> 12:50.763
Lay low and I'm gonna call you
first thing, all right?

12:50.854 --> 12:52.264
-Let's go.
-Bye,Jason.

12:52.356 --> 12:54.187
-Get in there.
-My man!

12:54.274 --> 12:55.684
Get the fuck in the car, come on.

12:55.776 --> 12:58.142
Jason took care of it, baby.
Jason took care of it.

12:58.236 --> 13:00.727
Jason's taking care of it. We're good.

13:00.822 --> 13:02.733
We're good. We're good.

13:02.824 --> 13:04.530
-Yeah, we're good.
-RICKY: We're good.

Of course his life is hard.
His name is JaMarcus.

13:09.289 --> 13:12.031
Hey, let me call you back.
Here comes my favorite ex-client.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.706
(LAUGHS) You better say that.

-(CHUCKLES)
-I'm setting up a pro day.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.420
Do you ever stop selling?

13:18.507 --> 13:19.997
Yeah, but you look like you could still play.

13:20.092 --> 13:21.332
Thank you. I appreciate that.

13:21.426 --> 13:23.337
So, did you handle that Ricky situation?

13:23.971 --> 13:25.711
(SIGHS) I already spoke to the GM.

13:25.806 --> 13:28.138
We're fucked. They're trying to move him.

13:28.225 --> 13:29.340
That quick?

13:29.434 --> 13:30.935
Yeah, well, shit's changed.

13:31.019 --> 13:34.102
-He's trending.
-Yeah, in the wrong goddamn direction.

13:34.189 --> 13:36.475
All right, I'll give him a call.
See if I can straighten his head out.

13:36.566 --> 13:37.726
In the meantime, did Vern hit you?

13:37.818 --> 13:41.185
Yeah, he left me some cryptic message.
What's up?

13:41.279 --> 13:43.565
Well, he's broke as a motherfucker,
that's what's up.

13:43.657 --> 13:46.148
-And he needs a loan.
-Not surprised.

13:46.243 --> 13:49.076
You know, his childhood friend
Reggie handles his money.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.118
Fat Reggie from Crenshaw
handles his money?

13:51.206 --> 13:54.619
Yeah. Thinks playing Pop Warner
together makes him E.F. Hutton.

13:54.710 --> 13:56.871
God damn. How could you let that happen?

13:56.962 --> 13:59.499
What, like I had a choice?
How did you let that happen?

13:59.589 --> 14:01.625
I'm trying to get him a new deal.

14:01.717 --> 14:03.253
I should be handling his money.

14:03.343 --> 14:04.628
Why aren't you handling his money?

14:07.389 --> 14:10.131
I know what this is about.
That old thing with the money manager.

14:10.225 --> 14:12.682
What'd he get you for?

14:12.769 --> 14:15.101
-800 grand.
-Look, we all get burned.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.224
Don't let Vernon learn the hard way, all right?

14:17.315 --> 14:18.350
He needs you.

14:18.442 --> 14:20.558
And if you don't sign him,
somebody else will.

14:22.112 --> 14:25.024
You're right. I'm gonna loan him
300K and sign him as a client.

14:25.115 --> 14:26.855
Whoa. (CHUCKLES)

14:27.617 --> 14:30.359
You're crazy. Spencer,
I know you don't got that kind of money.

14:30.454 --> 14:34.117
No crazier than you loaning
your first client 50K when you had zero.

14:34.666 --> 14:35.701
Things turned out okay for you.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.077
Yeah, but you were a sure thing.

14:38.045 --> 14:39.285
No, I wasn't.

14:39.963 --> 14:41.328
Not even close.

14:42.090 --> 14:44.376
Bro, bro, I'm on the elliptical
this morning watching SportsCenter.

14:44.468 --> 14:46.459
What's up with your boy Ricky?
What is it, cocaine?

14:46.553 --> 14:48.384
You've got to give me the real scoop.

14:48.472 --> 14:49.507
Ricky, what's going on, brother?

14:49.806 --> 14:50.966
-You wanted to talk?
-Yeah.

14:51.058 --> 14:52.468
Let's have dinner tonight, Prime 112.

14:52.559 --> 14:53.969
No, no, no, can't do that. Can't do that.

14:54.061 --> 14:56.302
I don't want to see nobody
and this cannot wait, Spence. Come on.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.057
-Where you at?
-Where else you think I am?

14:58.148 --> 15:00.309
I'm right outside your fucking office.
Come on, man, let's go.

15:05.655 --> 15:07.156
Hold on one second. Just give me a minute.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.949
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But, hey, listen to me. Listen to me.

15:11.036 --> 15:12.742
You should be handling him, okay?

15:12.829 --> 15:14.660
The time to pounce is
when people are at their weakest.

15:15.290 --> 15:17.997
He's weak. You smell that?
(SNIFFS) Blood in the water.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.370
-You hear me? Okay.
-Got it.

15:20.170 --> 15:21.125
What's up, Ricky?

15:21.213 --> 15:23.169
-It's on mute.
-Oh, okay.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.632
Just tell him I said, "What's up?" Okay?

15:24.716 --> 15:26.331
Okay, go, go, go, go.

15:26.968 --> 15:28.299
All right, brother. Let's roll.

15:28.553 --> 15:30.464
Hey, leave that corny
motherfucker in the ofﬁce, man.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.436
-I don't want to be traded.
-You've been traded before.

15:40.524 --> 15:42.640
Yeah, I was young and stupid then.

15:42.734 --> 15:45.111
-Then?
-Yeah, then. This time it's different, man.

15:45.195 --> 15:46.605
You know, I like where I am.

15:46.696 --> 15:49.233
Don't want to play the get-to-know-you game.
Learn a new playbook.

15:49.699 --> 15:52.190
Shit, I mean, they want to send me
to sorry-ass Jacksonville

15:52.536 --> 15:54.777
where careers go to die,
then I'll retire. I'll do something else.

15:54.871 --> 15:56.452
-I do not care.
-Are you threatening to quit?

15:56.540 --> 15:59.156
Spence, I had 80 catches last year, baby.
I had 80.

15:59.251 --> 16:02.118
So you're gonna retire early?

16:02.212 --> 16:05.670
Pull a Tiki Barber and pursue your dreams
after football, huh?

16:06.007 --> 16:07.383
(LAUGHS) Shit.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.083
You think there should be special rules?

16:10.804 --> 16:11.793
Ricky rules?

16:11.888 --> 16:13.924
Hell, no. I'm not saying that.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.305
But, you know, how could you know?

16:16.685 --> 16:18.425
They didn't treat you like this.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.393
Golden boy.

16:24.067 --> 16:25.056
Golden boy, huh?

16:26.736 --> 16:28.727
Let me tell you how it went down
for the golden boy.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.155
family and friends around.

16:40.250 --> 16:41.410
You know how it really went down?

16:42.878 --> 16:46.211
Iwas sitting up in my goddamn living room,
just staring at my cell phone,

16:46.798 --> 16:49.005
waiting for that call to come in
from the GM, the owner.

16:49.092 --> 16:51.333
I would have taken a call
from the fucking trainer.

16:52.262 --> 16:55.379
"Thank you, Spence. Appreciate it, Spence.

16:55.473 --> 16:57.464
"Good luck, Spence."

16:58.476 --> 17:00.307
You know when that call finally came?

17:02.814 --> 17:05.476
-Never.
-For real?

17:05.567 --> 17:07.774
You better wise the fuck up.

you're gonna be broke and miserable.

17:22.250 --> 17:23.626
And you know what the worst part about it is?

17:24.461 --> 17:26.747
Nobody will give a fuck about you.

17:27.714 --> 17:28.703
I've been there.

17:33.470 --> 17:34.550
You need to grow up.

17:34.638 --> 17:37.380
You need to start acting
and conducting yourself like a professional.

I want to add that I will never,

19:56.780 --> 19:58.065
Used to get after the QB for us.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.783
I heard you're concentrating
on the other side of the ball these days.

20:00.992 --> 20:03.028
-You calling about Jerret?
-Yes, lam.

20:03.119 --> 20:04.450
When did you become a registered agent?

20:04.537 --> 20:08.371
(CHUCKLES) Not an agent. Just a friend.

20:11.878 --> 20:14.164
-I was worried.
-Why?

20:14.255 --> 20:17.088
I came in, SportsCenterwasn't on.
You weren't on the couch.

20:17.175 --> 20:18.415
I thought somebody abducted you.

20:18.802 --> 20:20.884
Baby, why you always got to make jokes
at my expense?

20:20.970 --> 20:23.803
-You know I'm sensitive.
-'Cause deep down, I know you like it.

20:23.890 --> 20:24.970
I really don't, though.

20:25.475 --> 20:27.591
You always played better
for a hard-ass coach.

20:28.478 --> 20:29.513
True, but...

20:30.605 --> 20:32.391
You know Mama is always here for you.

20:32.857 --> 20:34.973
More than anything in this world,
I've got your back.

20:35.652 --> 20:37.142
We in this shit together.

20:38.405 --> 20:40.145
So, how'd it go today?

20:40.573 --> 20:42.188
-Any leads?
-Oh, man.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.698
Little rough out there
for your boy today, baby,

20:44.786 --> 20:45.901
but, uh... (CLEARS THROAT)

20:47.497 --> 20:51.285
You're now looking at the newest salesman
at the biggest Chevy dealership in Miami.

20:51.876 --> 20:53.741
(SQUEALING)

20:54.170 --> 20:56.161
-Yay!
-(BOTH LAUGH)

20:58.091 --> 21:00.582
I'm so proud of you. You did it. Oh.

21:01.052 --> 21:02.337
That was for you.

21:03.138 --> 21:04.423
CHARLES: Mmm.

21:07.183 --> 21:10.596
-Mmm-hmm. About to get a Chevy striptease.
-Oh.

21:11.354 --> 21:12.890
Dr. Greane.

21:12.981 --> 21:14.187
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

21:14.399 --> 21:17.186
-(HUMMING)
-Give it to me.

21:19.028 --> 21:21.280
And even more bad news
coming out of Green Bay

21:21.364 --> 21:23.446
for troubled slot receiver Ricky Jerret.

21:23.533 --> 21:26.275
The eight-year veteran
has just been released by the Packers.

21:26.369 --> 21:27.734
-Now he’s got to search for a new...
-(TV TURNS OFF)

21:36.045 --> 21:37.706
Dear God,

21:39.132 --> 21:42.044
you bestow upon me a chance
to play ball in this league again,

21:43.511 --> 21:45.502
a chance to lace up my shoes,

21:46.055 --> 21:47.591
a chance to put on that helmet

21:47.682 --> 21:51.140
and once again ball,
ball on these motherfuckers,

21:51.769 --> 21:53.430
I'll give you all the glory.

21:53.521 --> 21:54.897
I get it now.

21:56.858 --> 21:58.473
I'll do you proud.

22:02.030 --> 22:03.110
Amen.

22:06.409 --> 22:08.741
MAN: Try to sell on warranty,
try to sell on the gap...

22:08.828 --> 22:09.908
And what I do if I don't know something?

22:10.497 --> 22:12.783
Hey, you're a car salesman, Charles.
Just make it up.

22:14.709 --> 22:16.995
Ah, how you feel, sir?

22:17.086 --> 22:19.577
-I'm feeling good. How are you?
-Good. Good.

22:19.672 --> 22:20.707
You looking to upgrade?

22:20.798 --> 22:24.507
No, no, no. I'm looking for a truck,
for fishing in the Keys.

22:24.594 --> 22:26.880
Oh, fishing. I grew up fishing.

22:26.971 --> 22:30.088
My daddy taught me early.
Yeah. I still do some.

22:30.308 --> 22:31.673
Where? Back in Biloxi?

22:32.602 --> 22:33.557
How you know I'm from Mississippi?

22:33.645 --> 22:35.476
-Aren't you Charles Greane?
-Yes, sir.

22:35.980 --> 22:37.811
Larry Siefert, Miami Dolphins.

22:37.899 --> 22:39.560
I scouted you when I was at the U.

22:39.651 --> 22:42.358
Still can't believe we lost out
to Central Florida.

22:42.445 --> 22:44.777
Hey, UCF had a lot less folks back then.

22:45.281 --> 22:47.738
Wasn't always a city slicker like I am now.

22:48.409 --> 22:51.242
-This is the new model, right?
-Yeah, yeah, brand-new for this year.

22:51.329 --> 22:52.990
What are some of the upgrades?

22:53.081 --> 22:55.037
Uh... A lot of torque.

22:55.124 --> 22:57.251
It's got new torque power. The horsepower...

22:57.335 --> 23:00.498
-What's the horsepower?
-Oh, uh, it's got about 625.

23:00.588 --> 23:02.419
You played with, uh, Ricky Jerret, right?

23:02.507 --> 23:03.542
Yeah, yeah. About three seasons.

23:03.633 --> 23:05.043
Right after we won the Super Bowl.

23:05.134 --> 23:06.419
He sure is some character.

23:06.511 --> 23:09.173
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, that Ricky
is always entertaining.

23:09.681 --> 23:11.262
Is he as much of an ass as he appears?

23:11.724 --> 23:14.966
No, he's just passionate.
All Ricky cares about is winning.

23:15.478 --> 23:17.014
If anything, he's just a little misunderstood.

23:17.105 --> 23:20.063
-Aren't we all?
-I guess so.

23:22.652 --> 23:25.234
Hey, mister, you really here about this Chevy,

23:25.321 --> 23:27.232
or you came to kick the tires on Ricky?

23:27.323 --> 23:29.154
(CHUCKLES)

23:29.242 --> 23:30.778
People often mistake country with dumb.

23:31.369 --> 23:32.950
Those people are usually from the city.

23:33.580 --> 23:35.241
Good point.

23:35.832 --> 23:37.572
So this... The great...

23:38.668 --> 23:40.124
MAN: That guy looked like a buyer, man.

23:40.211 --> 23:41.997
Did you get his phone number,
contact, anything?

23:42.839 --> 23:44.750
Oh, man, it don't matter.
He ain't buying nothing.

23:44.841 --> 23:46.581
What the fuck? You got a crystal ball now?

23:46.676 --> 23:48.086
You can see the future?

23:48.177 --> 23:50.463
I prayed to God and he answered my calls.

23:50.555 --> 23:51.761
(LAUGHS)

23:51.848 --> 23:53.679
You know the Lord works in mysterious ways.

23:54.350 --> 23:55.931
I also know that it was me
and your super-agent

23:56.019 --> 23:57.350
who got you that in-person with Miami.

23:57.437 --> 23:59.177
See that? It's all part of God's plan, ain't it?

23:59.522 --> 24:01.513
-Let's talk about our plan.
-Lets.

24:01.608 --> 24:02.688
Need you to be contrite.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.060
Let him know
you learned from the experience.

24:04.152 --> 24:07.019
-Yes, be humble.
-Also that it won't happen again.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.944
-Never.
-And that you're gonna do anything the coach

24:09.032 --> 24:10.738
-and team need you to do.
-Absolutely.

24:10.825 --> 24:12.486
-Even play special teams.
-Absolutely not.

24:12.577 --> 24:13.862
-I'm not doing that.
-Rick.

24:14.203 --> 24:15.784
I'll even play special teams.

24:15.872 --> 24:19.160
Good... (CLAPPING) Now get going.
You don't want to be late, okay?

24:19.250 --> 24:20.365
He's a stickler for punctuality.

24:20.627 --> 24:22.288
I won't be late, yo.

24:22.378 --> 24:24.494
And I know I'm not
the easiest person to deal with.

24:24.589 --> 24:26.921
So I appreciate y'all don't bail on me
when shit goes down.

24:27.008 --> 24:28.623
Never crossed our minds. Let's go.

24:28.718 --> 24:31.300
I'm a passionate man.
It's all coming from a spiritual place.

24:31.721 --> 24:33.677
Hmm. That right there, don't say that.

24:37.060 --> 24:38.675
-Get it.
-RICKY: Whoo!

24:40.229 --> 24:41.514
He's gonna fuck this up.

24:41.606 --> 24:43.142
Yeah, about a 60% chance.

24:43.232 --> 24:44.893
RICKY: Got this!

24:51.240 --> 24:53.777
-Coach. Coach.
-Hey, Csonk, get me one of them, uh, Peronis.

24:53.868 --> 24:56.154
-Coach.
-Yeah?

24:56.245 --> 24:59.373
-Um, I'm sorry, I... (STUTTERS)
-What? You're what?

24:59.457 --> 25:01.288
-It's 5:01.
-Which makes you?

25:02.085 --> 25:03.825
-Late.
-Good, then we understand each other.

25:03.920 --> 25:06.332
You do me a favor, undo that line right there.

25:06.422 --> 25:07.707
-This one?
-Right there.

25:10.051 --> 25:11.837
I got you, Coach. I got you.

25:13.012 --> 25:14.468
You are an asshole.

25:17.517 --> 25:19.974
Bad life choices, son. Bad life choices.

25:21.437 --> 25:22.688
Coach!

25:51.718 --> 25:53.879
My man! Come deliver that green hug.

25:53.970 --> 25:55.631
-Hey, come on in, man.
-Thank you.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.013
You know I appreciate this.

26:00.476 --> 26:02.967
It's the biggest favor
anybody's ever done for me.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.222
Thank you. I can't thank you enough.

26:04.313 --> 26:05.723
You're welcome.

26:09.110 --> 26:11.101
Who the fuck are all these people?

26:13.030 --> 26:14.110
(WHISPERING) I don't even know.

26:15.700 --> 26:17.816
You better start knowing.

26:19.412 --> 26:22.370
Hey, thank you, man. I'm good for this.

26:22.957 --> 26:24.618
I'm gonna pay you back with interest.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.415
I know you will.

26:26.502 --> 26:27.753
'Cause now you're a client.

26:27.837 --> 26:30.328
Hey, cool. You want to hang out a little bit?

26:33.468 --> 26:34.958
No, I'm good.

26:35.052 --> 26:36.758
Have fun. I'll call you tomorrow.

26:36.846 --> 26:38.507
VERNON: Ma, where Eugene at?

26:56.699 --> 26:59.486
Damn, you got a big set of balls on you,
I'll give you that.

27:00.077 --> 27:01.783
I want you to know who I am, Coach.

27:02.413 --> 27:04.153
-People talk a lot of shit about me.
-Mmm-hmm.

27:04.248 --> 27:05.784
I understand my rep.

27:05.875 --> 27:07.957
Yeah, well, don't worry about that.
I form my own opinions.

27:08.544 --> 27:11.331
Look, I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry I was late.

27:11.798 --> 27:12.787
Let me ask you a question.

27:12.882 --> 27:14.463
What are the three most
important things to you?

27:14.550 --> 27:18.293
-God, family, football.
-That's good.

27:18.387 --> 27:20.423
For a second there,
I thought you were gonna say friends.

27:20.515 --> 27:21.630
I wasn't.

27:21.724 --> 27:24.807
Jerret, there are very few people
that deserve a second chance,

27:24.894 --> 27:27.010
and there's less that deserve a third.
Are you one of those people?

27:27.104 --> 27:28.230
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

27:28.314 --> 27:29.975
That's good. That's real good.

27:30.066 --> 27:31.931
Now you keep your head on straight,
you work hard,

27:32.026 --> 27:34.017
you've got a shot.

27:35.488 --> 27:36.898
Welcome to the Miami Dolphins, son.

27:39.617 --> 27:41.448
Coach, you won't regret this.

27:41.536 --> 27:43.447
Oh, yeah, well,
I've heard that one before. We'll see.

27:44.038 --> 27:47.075
Oh, by the way, not everybody thinks
you're a low-rent scumbag.

27:47.542 --> 27:48.998
Somebody actually had
something nice to say about you.

27:49.085 --> 27:50.074
Yeah, like who?

27:50.169 --> 27:51.625
You know the guy who works
at the Chevy dealership?

27:52.463 --> 27:53.703
You don't know Charles Greane?

27:55.258 --> 27:56.919
No shit. Charles got a job?

27:57.510 --> 27:59.501
Go help Csonk get the fish out of the cooler.

27:59.595 --> 28:01.210

I think we can work something out.

to use both hands, then.
