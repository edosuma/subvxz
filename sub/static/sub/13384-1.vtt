<i>Well, hey, oh, hey
This will make your day</i>

01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:13.516
<i>Boy, they call me Billy A</i>

01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:15.875
<i>I like to chew and a-spit
And throw a ball a little bit</i>

01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:17.996
<i>Boy, you better stay out
of my way</i>

01:56:18.200 --> 01:56:20.191
<i>Enough with that, Jake here
Just a chill dude</i>

01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:22.430
<i>I'll sweep you off your feet
No need to be crude</i>

01:56:22.520 --> 01:56:24.376
<i>If I sense any question
I'll put you to the test</i>

01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:26.789
<i>If it's a crime to be sexy
then you're under arrest</i>

01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:28.632
<i>- You talkin' to me?
- No, can't you see?</i>

01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:29.994
<i>Well, who you talking to?</i>

01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:31.149
<i>Uh, dude, not you</i>

01:56:31.240 --> 01:56:33.117
<i>Well, okay, dude,
you kinda rude</i>

01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:35.634
<i>I ain 't really a fan
of that attitude</i>

01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:37.551
<i>As I was saying before
Billy interrupted</i>

01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:38.880
<i>We just having
good times, baby</i>

01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:39.960
<i>Nothing too corrupted</i>

01:56:40.040 --> 01:56:41.996
<i>If you need a little insight
on who I am</i>

01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:44.355
<i>Let me break it down for you
right now with my jam</i>

01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:46.271
<i>Unlike Finn I don't drop
to the knee</i>

01:56:46.400 --> 01:56:48.516
<i>'Cause I got a bigger secret
I drop to my feet</i>

01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:50.670
<i>I'm the kinda guy
that'll meet you after class</i>

01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:52.830
<i>Take pride in my pitching
Like Rope and his ass</i>

01:56:52.920 --> 01:56:55.036
<i>Now, come over here
with those luscious thighs</i>

01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:57.793
<i>I'll make you feel loved
while Willy's getting high</i>
