01:46:15.453 --> 01:46:17.495
I hear you're going home.

01:46:19.832 --> 01:46:21.499
I came to say goodbye.

01:46:31.343 --> 01:46:33.720
I want to go with you, Gilda.

01:46:35.681 --> 01:46:37.640
Please, take me.

01:46:40.478 --> 01:46:45.273
I know I did everything wrong.
Isn't it wonderful?

01:46:45.441 --> 01:46:47.942
Nobody has to apologize

01:46:48.110 --> 01:46:53.281
because we were both
such stinkers, weren't we?

01:46:54.658 --> 01:46:56.701
Isn't it wonderful?

01:46:58.245 --> 01:46:59.954
Wonderful.

01:47:14.595 --> 01:47:19.599
BALLIN:
I didn't intend to come back so soon,
but I want my wife.

01:47:19.767 --> 01:47:21.267
Johnny.

01:47:22.144 --> 01:47:24.979
You thought I died that night,
didn't you?

01:47:25.147 --> 01:47:28.775
I had murdered a man and thought it
simpler to disappear for a while.

01:47:28.943 --> 01:47:33.321
I came to the house that night,
to get Gilda, to take her with me.

01:47:33.489 --> 01:47:37.450
But I found her occupied
with you, Johnny.

01:47:37.618 --> 01:47:41.079
I had neither the time nor
the inclination for an emotional scene.

01:47:41.247 --> 01:47:43.957
By the time the police reached
the plane wreckage

01:47:44.125 --> 01:47:48.044
I was gone to the launch I had waiting.
You didn't see me parachute out.

01:47:48.212 --> 01:47:50.797
You weren't seeing very clearly
that night anyway.

01:47:50.965 --> 01:47:54.425
Emotion is so apt to cloud the brain,
isn't it?

01:47:54.593 --> 01:47:56.970
I intended to kill you with this,
Johnny.

01:47:57.138 --> 01:48:01.141
I thought it amusing to have
one of my little friends kill the other.

01:48:03.018 --> 01:48:05.145
But now, it won't do,

01:48:07.231 --> 01:48:09.232
because I have to kill Gilda too.

01:48:12.736 --> 01:48:14.863
I told you I'd be looking... Ah!

01:48:28.252 --> 01:48:32.922
Gilda. Better get out of here,
Uncle Pio, quick!

01:48:51.901 --> 01:48:54.110
You know, I'm a great cop, Mr. Farrel.

01:48:54.278 --> 01:48:56.613
I'm certainly a pushover
for a love story.

01:48:56.780 --> 01:49:00.491
I know the combination of the safe,
and I don't know where the safe is.

01:49:01.202 --> 01:49:03.369
The safe, where is it?

01:49:03.996 --> 01:49:07.081
It's in his room on the wall,
back of the desk.

01:49:07.249 --> 01:49:10.793
Thanks. Say, haven't I seen
that cane somewhere before?

01:49:12.171 --> 01:49:15.423
You have. You shouldn't leave things
like that lying around

01:49:15.591 --> 01:49:18.301
where I can get my hands on them.
He's lying,

01:49:18.469 --> 01:49:20.678
like the gentleman
I always said he was.

01:49:20.846 --> 01:49:22.931
It was I...
Keep your mouth shut!

01:49:23.098 --> 01:49:26.267
You two can quit being noble
anytime you like, you know.

01:49:26.435 --> 01:49:28.102
Because a man can only die once.

01:49:28.270 --> 01:49:30.730
And Mundson committed suicide
three months ago.

01:49:30.898 --> 01:49:35.860
Besides, didn't you ever hear of
a thing called justifiable homicide?

01:49:38.530 --> 01:49:41.532
Johnny, let's go home.

01:49:42.409 --> 01:49:44.285
Let's go home.
