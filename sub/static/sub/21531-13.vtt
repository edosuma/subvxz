WEBVTT

00:06.407 --> 00:08.609
Oh, good morning, Elizabeth.
You got today's mail?

00:10.111 --> 00:13.081
Yeah...can you start
calling me Dave?

00:13.181 --> 00:14.615
My girlfriend found out

00:14.715 --> 00:16.117
about this whole
Elizabeth thing,

00:16.217 --> 00:18.586
and now she
calls me that, and...

00:18.686 --> 00:20.388
And I try to be cool
with it,

00:20.488 --> 00:22.723
but it's kind of weird
when we're making out.

00:23.824 --> 00:25.259
Well, of course it's weird.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.661
You're making out
with a woman.

00:30.731 --> 00:32.566
That'll be all, Elizabeth.

00:35.236 --> 00:37.171
Ah, yeah, yeah!

00:40.141 --> 00:42.443
You like that, don't cha,
straighty?

00:44.245 --> 00:46.114
Hey, honey.

00:46.214 --> 00:48.682
Hey, Kar, do you know
what this is?

00:48.782 --> 00:51.485
A letter saying gays shouldn't
be allowed on television?

00:51.585 --> 00:53.187
Because that would
be horrible.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.125
And early.

00:57.225 --> 01:00.461
That thing shouldn't have
gotten here till tomorrow.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.630
No, no, it's a piece
of fan mail.

01:02.730 --> 01:06.434
From Tommy Shields
of Lorraine County, Ohio.

01:06.534 --> 01:08.536
He and his parents
just visited New York,

01:08.636 --> 01:10.604
and he saw an episode
of Jack Talk.

01:10.704 --> 01:14.175
"It was neat to see how
comfortable you are being gay.

01:14.275 --> 01:17.511
It made me want to come out,
but I am too scared."

01:17.611 --> 01:20.448
Oh, this is so sad.

01:20.548 --> 01:22.850
[laughs]

01:22.950 --> 01:25.686
Okay. All right.
But then it gets funny.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.421
[laughs]

01:27.521 --> 01:31.125
Oh, but then
it gets sad again.

01:31.225 --> 01:33.861
Aah! He ended funny!
Good for him!

01:33.961 --> 01:35.529
All right.

01:35.629 --> 01:37.298
Well, Karen, this is what
I've been waiting for.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.467
The opportunity to make it
seem like you can read?

01:43.504 --> 01:44.538
No.

01:44.638 --> 01:45.839
Can't you see?

01:46.940 --> 01:48.909
I have to go to Ohio
and help little Tommy come out.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.778
That way he can come on my show
and tell his story.

01:50.811 --> 01:53.147
[gasps]
This could be my Oprah moment.

01:54.282 --> 01:56.116
And then when he
goes to greet me,

01:56.217 --> 01:57.385
we'll do the Oprah hug.

01:57.485 --> 01:58.452
What's that?

01:58.552 --> 01:59.887
Here, try to hug me.

01:59.987 --> 02:01.289
Okay.

02:02.856 --> 02:05.293
Good for you!
Good for you!

02:26.947 --> 02:28.482
How many kids is this
for Rob and Ellen...

02:28.582 --> 02:29.717
five, six?

02:29.817 --> 02:31.652
And which one
am I godmother to,

02:31.752 --> 02:34.154
the crosseyed one
or the one with the weird ear?

02:35.689 --> 02:37.858
It's so annoying.
Another kid, another gift.

02:37.958 --> 02:39.793
I'm so tired of rewarding
straight married couples

02:39.893 --> 02:42.696
for not wearing a condom.

02:42.796 --> 02:43.864
I know, right?

02:43.964 --> 02:45.766
I mean, how many kids
do you need?

02:45.866 --> 02:47.435
It's like they're trying
for a good one,

02:47.535 --> 02:49.503
and that's
not gonna happen.

02:53.341 --> 02:54.842
And the thought of them
going at it,

02:54.942 --> 02:56.910
just rutting like pigs
and sweating--

02:57.010 --> 02:58.612
Hi!
Hey!

02:58.712 --> 03:01.181
Hey, you guys.
Mwah!

03:01.282 --> 03:03.517
He-le-le-le-lello.

03:03.617 --> 03:04.852
Thank you, guys,
for meeting us

03:04.952 --> 03:06.387
at our favorite
restaurant.

03:06.487 --> 03:07.888
You know, on two
separate occasions,

03:07.988 --> 03:09.890
Ellen's water broke
right over there.

03:09.990 --> 03:12.660
Yeah, we were here
one of those nights.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.962
I remember, 'cause
I was wearing sandals.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.933
Ahem, so...

03:20.033 --> 03:22.370
Someone looks like
she's pudged out a little.

03:22.470 --> 03:24.738
Is there something
you'd like to tell us?

03:24.838 --> 03:26.340
Sure.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.875
First of all,
I'm not pregnant,

03:27.975 --> 03:29.777
so you just called me fat
for no reason.

03:31.845 --> 03:33.281
And secondly--
No, let me tell 'em,
honey.

03:33.381 --> 03:34.348
No, let me.

03:34.448 --> 03:35.916
Let's do it together.
Ooh, fun.

03:36.016 --> 03:36.750
Ready?
Mm-hmm.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.852
One, two, three.

03:38.952 --> 03:40.788
We're separated!
We're separated!

03:42.856 --> 03:44.692
Yep, we did it.
Splitsville.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.960
Sayonara town.
Separation station.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.796
[pop]

03:48.896 --> 03:51.532
No. No, no!

03:51.632 --> 03:52.866
You guys
can't get separated.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.335
You've been together
since college.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.236
You have five
beautiful children.

03:56.337 --> 03:57.938
Or so.

03:58.038 --> 03:59.873
I gotta say,
you guys seem

03:59.973 --> 04:01.842
really okay
about this.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.444
Actually, we have
never been better.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.379
We used to fight all the time
when we were together.

04:05.479 --> 04:06.780
And now that we're apart,
well...

04:06.880 --> 04:08.782
it's like we're
best friends again.
Yeah.

04:08.882 --> 04:10.451
Well, I'm really happy
for you guys.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.486
I'm not.

04:12.586 --> 04:13.587
You guys are the reason

04:13.687 --> 04:15.389
I believe
marriage can still work.

04:15.489 --> 04:17.525
I mean, someone's
gotta stay together

04:17.625 --> 04:20.428
besides Ben Stiller's
parents.

04:22.062 --> 04:24.598
Grace, you know,
for some couples,

04:24.698 --> 04:26.266
breaking up
is the right thing to do.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.302
Well, you know
that cop you used to date?

04:28.402 --> 04:29.937
Vince?
Perfect example

04:30.037 --> 04:31.305
of breaking up
being the right thing.

04:31.405 --> 04:32.840
I mean, I know that I've
definitely grown

04:32.940 --> 04:34.608
and matured.

04:34.708 --> 04:35.676
No, I mean
he's over there.

04:35.776 --> 04:36.844
Vince is here?

04:36.944 --> 04:37.945
Oh, God, please
don't let him see me.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.980
Crisscross, applesauce.

04:42.082 --> 04:44.818
Hey, whatever happened
between you and Vince?

04:44.918 --> 04:47.755
They broke up after
he got fired from the force.

04:47.855 --> 04:50.524
Vince was kind of a mess,
and they agreed that

04:50.624 --> 04:52.693
he should take some time
and get his act together.

04:52.793 --> 04:53.827
Buona sera.

04:53.927 --> 04:55.963
Anybody want
something to drink?

04:56.063 --> 04:56.997
Will?

04:57.097 --> 04:58.399
Vince?

04:58.499 --> 04:59.800
You work here?

04:59.900 --> 05:01.902
Uh...yeah.

05:03.471 --> 05:06.507
I think Will's water
just broke.

05:11.412 --> 05:12.380
So Tommy e-mailed me

05:12.480 --> 05:13.747
and said to meet him here.

05:13.847 --> 05:16.016
His job
is spraying the shoes

05:16.116 --> 05:19.887
before renting them
out to bowlers.

05:19.987 --> 05:23.624
When I was a boy,
I worked in a supermarket.

05:23.724 --> 05:24.925
Oh!

05:25.025 --> 05:27.661
Did I say I was a boy?

05:28.962 --> 05:30.998
Guess I wasn't.

05:31.098 --> 05:33.000
I was a girl.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.903
Excuse me.
Do you bowl?

05:36.003 --> 05:38.071
Uh, sure...

05:38.171 --> 05:39.473
I love to bowl.

05:40.474 --> 05:41.742
Wanna do it here
or out by the garbage cans?

05:43.511 --> 05:45.913
I'm pretty sure
these middle-aged women

05:46.013 --> 05:48.849
are asking you
if you want to bowl.

05:48.949 --> 05:49.983
Uh, I'm 29.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.119
Welcome to Ohio.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.625
We're in a league,
and we're one short.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.427
Is there any way
you could fill in?

05:59.527 --> 06:01.762
[chuckling]
Oh, I don't think so.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.731
Our friend Peg
couldn't make it

06:03.831 --> 06:05.098
'cause her hatchback
wouldn't start.

06:05.198 --> 06:08.469
Your story has moved me.
I'm in.

06:08.569 --> 06:11.004
Great. I'm Jean
and this is Rhonda.

06:11.104 --> 06:14.041
Anastasia Beaverhouse.

06:17.811 --> 06:18.879
Nice to meet you.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.581
Now, I'll need
a 12-pound ball

06:20.681 --> 06:21.815
and a big plate
of fried food.

06:21.915 --> 06:23.050
From the looks
of this place,

06:23.150 --> 06:25.553
my ass has got a lot
of catching up to do.

06:28.956 --> 06:30.724
So, Vince,
you're a--

06:30.824 --> 06:31.959
you're a waiter.

06:32.059 --> 06:32.993
That's--that's great.

06:33.093 --> 06:35.729
Yeah.
This is my gun now.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.798
You have the right
to remain bland.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.066
[laughter]

06:39.166 --> 06:41.935
Get it, 'cause the pepper
makes it less bland?

06:42.035 --> 06:44.004
You know, Vince,
anything you say

06:44.104 --> 06:45.973
can and will be used
to make me laugh.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.941
[laughs]

06:49.977 --> 06:51.979
It's so great
to see you, Vince.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.046
Hey, you too, Grace.

06:53.146 --> 06:54.047
How you doing?

06:54.147 --> 06:55.082
Okay.

06:55.182 --> 06:57.084
You know, uh, let's see.

06:57.184 --> 07:00.087
Uh, work's great.
Still living with Will.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.422
But I'm gonna get
out of there any day now.

07:03.624 --> 07:04.992
Uh...

07:05.092 --> 07:06.960
What else?
Oh, um, yeah.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.562
We're still
waiting on waters,

07:08.662 --> 07:10.764
and it's been,
like, 10 minutes.

07:12.165 --> 07:13.133
The busboy gets that.

07:13.233 --> 07:15.569
Oh, gosh, off course.
I'm sorry.

07:15.669 --> 07:17.204
That's, heh,
that was so obnoxious.

07:17.304 --> 07:20.541
It's just that the pitcher's
just, like, right there.

07:24.177 --> 07:26.113
I forgot
you were like this.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.985
God, how sad is that?

07:32.085 --> 07:34.154
He's working as a waiter
at The Pasta Village?

07:34.254 --> 07:36.123
Can you imagine
anything more pathetic?

07:36.223 --> 07:37.891
I'd kill myself.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.927
Hi.
I'll be your new waiter.

07:41.562 --> 07:45.198
And, while I'm still alive,
I'll be serving you.

07:46.767 --> 07:49.570
You're our waiter?
What happened to Vince?

07:49.670 --> 07:51.004
I think we're gonna need
another minute.

07:51.104 --> 07:53.106
I'm still trying to figure out
if I want the lobster

07:53.206 --> 07:57.110
spelled with two Bs
and a trademark symbol.

07:57.210 --> 08:00.113
Grace, it is better
than the real thing.

08:00.213 --> 08:03.216
The shell is made
out of bacon.

08:04.852 --> 08:08.155
Then they inject it
with cheese.

08:08.255 --> 08:11.258
And it's spelled
with five Es.

08:14.227 --> 08:15.563
Can you believe that?

08:15.663 --> 08:17.798
I know,
I am totally getting it.

08:17.898 --> 08:20.200
No! Not that.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.803
Vince sent another waiter
over to cover our table.

08:22.903 --> 08:26.707
Poor guy, this must
be so awkward for him.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.742
You know, he went from
"crime doesn't pay"

08:28.842 --> 08:31.812
to "the soup of the day."

08:31.912 --> 08:32.980
Hm-mmm.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.147
Hm-mmm.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.885
Go talk to him.

08:37.985 --> 08:40.053
So? He's a waiter.

08:40.153 --> 08:42.556
There's no reason
this has to be awkward.

08:42.656 --> 08:44.524
You're right, Grace.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.560
[whispering]
Oh, my God, I can't believe

08:46.660 --> 08:48.061
he's actually going over
to see Vince.

08:48.161 --> 08:51.098
And I totally thought
tonight was gonna be boring!

08:57.738 --> 08:59.539
Tommy, Tommy,
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy,

08:59.640 --> 09:01.208
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy,
Tommy, Tommy....

09:04.211 --> 09:07.114
Confusion in his eyes.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.149
No product in his hair.

09:09.249 --> 09:10.217
That's my boy.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.755
Hi.

09:14.855 --> 09:15.823
Hi.

09:15.923 --> 09:18.158
You need some help,
don't cha?

09:18.258 --> 09:19.860
Yeah, I do.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.195
Jack's here.
Now...

09:22.295 --> 09:23.731
I know it can be
very difficult

09:23.831 --> 09:24.898
to admit that you're gay.

09:24.998 --> 09:26.233
I'm not gay.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.602
I'm just looking for someone
over 21 to buy me beer.

09:29.703 --> 09:31.271
Oh...all right.

09:31.371 --> 09:32.973
Well, you might wanna
talk to that lady over there.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.808
She can get you
real messed up.

09:36.376 --> 09:38.278
Well, if that's
not Tommy--

09:38.378 --> 09:40.013
Jack?

09:40.113 --> 09:41.815
Jack McFarland?

09:41.915 --> 09:43.183
It's me!

09:43.283 --> 09:44.652
Tommy!

09:52.059 --> 09:54.194
Nope, not him either.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.298
Hey, Vince, look.

09:58.398 --> 10:01.735
I don't want this to be weird
between us, you know.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.270
So you went from,
"I'll read you your rights"

10:03.370 --> 10:04.938
to "I'll bring you
your Sprites."

10:05.038 --> 10:06.774
(Grace)
Knock it off!

10:09.943 --> 10:13.113
You know, that's a little
condescending, Will.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.382
Waiting tables
is an important job.

10:15.482 --> 10:18.318
Without waiters,
people wouldn't, like, eat.

10:18.418 --> 10:20.220
Well, they could
cook themselves.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.755
Yeah, but they couldn't
eat in a restaurant.

10:21.855 --> 10:23.991
Well, they could go to
places that have self serve.

10:24.091 --> 10:25.292
Will,
what are you doing?

10:25.392 --> 10:27.160
I'm sorry, I can't...

10:27.260 --> 10:28.328
I didn't mean to--

10:28.428 --> 10:30.163
All right, look.
Just drop it, okay?

10:30.263 --> 10:31.264
I'm in the weeds, man.

10:31.364 --> 10:32.666
Two busboys
called in sick,

10:32.766 --> 10:34.101
so I'm picking up
all my dirties.

10:34.201 --> 10:36.169
My hands are covered
in sauce and influenza,

10:36.269 --> 10:37.738
and I'm freaking out
because I just touched my eye.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.641
You know that guy?

10:41.742 --> 10:43.243
Yeah, he's my ex.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.345
That isn't gonna be a problem,
is it, detective?

10:45.445 --> 10:46.313
No. I'm sorry.

10:46.413 --> 10:48.415
I...couldn't get rid of him.

10:48.515 --> 10:50.217
I'll just go over
and tell them

10:50.317 --> 10:51.384
I'm undercover
on a drug bust.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.153
That's called
blowing your cover.

10:53.253 --> 10:56.123
No, just keep it together
until the handoff happens,

10:56.223 --> 10:57.257
then we move in, got it?

10:57.357 --> 10:59.359
Sir...

10:59.459 --> 11:03.430
I am totally focused on
catching these sons of bitches.

11:03.530 --> 11:05.365
Ooh, birthday.
I'm head clapper!

11:06.499 --> 11:08.802
One, two, three, four!
Happy, happy...

11:14.074 --> 11:16.844
Getting separated was
a really hard decision, but--

11:16.944 --> 11:18.445
Grace.
How'd it go
with Vince?

11:18.545 --> 11:21.114
We felt really good
about it.

11:21.214 --> 11:23.016
I really--I think
we should leave.

11:23.116 --> 11:26.086
Really? 'Cause the first
basket of unlimited breadsticks

11:26.186 --> 11:28.255
just got here.

11:28.355 --> 11:31.124
I mean, if we want,
they can just keep coming.

11:31.224 --> 11:32.993
Forever.

11:33.093 --> 11:36.029
Look, Vince can't even
talk to me, you know?

11:36.129 --> 11:37.064
I mean, uh...

11:37.164 --> 11:38.966
For some reason,
he thinks I'm gonna judge him.

11:39.066 --> 11:42.770
Oh...okay.
So we're doing that again.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.371
Doing what?

11:44.471 --> 11:46.974
You're gonna leave him
because he's a mess.

11:47.074 --> 11:49.442
Looks like that's turning
into a pattern with you.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.978
Wait,
he broke up with me

11:51.078 --> 11:52.079
'cause he wanted
to get his act together.

11:52.179 --> 11:52.913
Oh, come on.

11:53.013 --> 11:55.082
You left him
when he needed you most.

11:55.182 --> 11:56.049
Ellen and I
did the same thing.

11:56.149 --> 11:57.885
Okay, shush,
I'm talking.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.955
Maybe this is my fault.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.256
I should have
stuck with him.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.192
What is it with me
that I leave people

12:05.292 --> 12:06.760
when they need me most?

12:06.860 --> 12:07.761
You know,
we need you guys--

12:07.861 --> 12:08.862
Not now, Rob.

12:11.364 --> 12:12.465
You know, Grace,

12:12.565 --> 12:14.067
we invited you guys here

12:14.167 --> 12:15.836
to talk about me and Rob.

12:15.936 --> 12:20.073
And, well, I feel that you're
not really listening to us.

12:20.173 --> 12:21.308
Whew, that
was hard for me.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.010
You did great.
You really did.

12:25.512 --> 12:27.214
No, I'm listening.

12:27.314 --> 12:29.216
The two of you
are both making

12:29.316 --> 12:31.018
the biggest mistake
of your lives--got it.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.886
N-n--
Grace, no.

12:32.986 --> 12:35.055
We wanna be
single again, okay?

12:35.155 --> 12:36.223
I want to experiment.

12:36.323 --> 12:38.225
I wanna go out
and buy a Corvette,

12:38.325 --> 12:39.326
and use a condom.

12:40.560 --> 12:41.761
Me too!

12:41.862 --> 12:44.397
Now I feel all hot
and sassy again!

12:44.497 --> 12:46.066
I wanna wear
a belly shirt, Grace.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.868
You know,
I wanna go to clubs

12:47.968 --> 12:50.904
and eat angel dust.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.475
Wait a minute.
That's what this is about?

12:55.575 --> 12:56.910
You want to date?

12:57.010 --> 12:57.911
Yeah.

12:58.011 --> 13:00.380
Oh, wow.

13:00.480 --> 13:03.283
Okay, well, you know,
good luck.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.418
'Cause I've
been out there

13:05.518 --> 13:08.989
for the past two decades.

13:09.089 --> 13:13.160
And it takes work to find
someone who can stand you.

13:15.628 --> 13:16.897
And, Ellen,
God love you,

13:16.997 --> 13:18.165
but a belly shirt?

13:18.265 --> 13:19.933
I mean, you've been pregnant,
like, 30 times.

13:20.033 --> 13:22.035
Every shirt you own
is a belly shirt.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.170
[laughs]

13:23.270 --> 13:24.104
What are you laughing at,
dough boy?

13:24.204 --> 13:25.438
You think some

13:25.538 --> 13:27.007
sexy co-ed is gonna
wanna hang out

13:27.107 --> 13:29.076
at The Pasta Village
with a 40-year-old accountant

13:29.176 --> 13:30.277
whose idea of sexy

13:31.278 --> 13:32.345
is making honking sounds
while squeezing them?

13:32.445 --> 13:33.413
Honk, honk!

13:35.983 --> 13:38.018
You said
you liked that.

13:38.118 --> 13:39.152
Well,
it's better than...

13:39.252 --> 13:41.054
[blubbering]

13:46.226 --> 13:49.162
Look...
you're getting old.

13:49.262 --> 13:50.463
You're not
very interesting,

13:50.563 --> 13:52.165
and you're both
losing your hair.

13:52.265 --> 13:53.400
[gasps]

13:56.169 --> 13:58.371
You belong together.

13:58.471 --> 14:01.108
If not for love,
than for the mere fact

14:01.208 --> 14:04.244
that no one else
is gonna take you.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.450
[crying]
I am not losing my hair.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.120
I started
plucking the gray ones,

14:13.220 --> 14:14.387
and I just
couldn't stop!

14:18.225 --> 14:20.260
You proud of yourself?

14:21.261 --> 14:22.429
Go get her.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.902
Honey, I just
got a strike!

14:29.002 --> 14:30.938
And a fungal infection
under my nail.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.541
Isn't that exciting?

14:34.641 --> 14:36.643
All I need is a factory job
and dead tooth,

14:36.743 --> 14:38.345
and I'll fit right in.

14:41.081 --> 14:43.583
Karen...you see
that old man over there?

14:43.683 --> 14:45.052
Yeah.

14:45.152 --> 14:46.486
He's Tommy.

14:46.586 --> 14:49.923
Man, the Midwest takes
a lot out of a teenager.

14:52.125 --> 14:54.127
I was looking for
an Oprah moment,

14:54.227 --> 14:56.329
not a Willard Scott moment.

14:56.429 --> 14:59.099
There is no way
I'm putting him on Jack Talk.

14:59.199 --> 15:02.302
Jack, I cannot believe
that you won't help that man!

15:02.402 --> 15:03.336
Why should I?

15:03.436 --> 15:04.604
He misled me.

15:04.704 --> 15:07.074
By using the name Tommy,
he implied he was

15:07.174 --> 15:09.476
young, innocent,
muscular, and curious.

15:09.576 --> 15:13.246
Honey, if that man
only had one day left,

15:13.346 --> 15:16.116
and you could help him
to live it honestly,

15:16.216 --> 15:18.018
then that's what
you should be doing.

15:18.118 --> 15:20.520
What is more important
than living life

15:20.620 --> 15:22.355
as your most authentic self?

15:22.455 --> 15:25.292
You're up,
Anastasia.

15:25.392 --> 15:27.127
Stop following me around.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.295
You're not supposed
to be in the kitchen.

15:28.395 --> 15:31.464
I just want you to know
how sorry I am.

15:31.564 --> 15:34.267
That's fine.
Just forget it, okay?

15:34.367 --> 15:35.535
Go sit down.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.205
I still got 10 more lobsters
to pump full of cheese

15:38.305 --> 15:39.672
and paint little eyes on.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.042
(man)
Uh...waiter!

15:42.142 --> 15:42.909
Can I talk to you?

15:43.010 --> 15:45.512
I'll be right
with you, sir.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.251
Well, we're
back together.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.286
We figured it's best
for the kids.

15:53.386 --> 15:56.256
Yeah, we might as well make it
all the way to the finish line.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.291
You know...death.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.262
That's a cheerful
way to put it.

16:02.362 --> 16:03.696
It's better than your way.
"Best for the kids."

16:03.796 --> 16:06.133
The kids hate you!
The kids hate you!

16:09.269 --> 16:11.438
See, this feels right.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.141
Your entrees were late.

16:14.241 --> 16:15.242
We're gonna
comp your appetizers.

16:15.342 --> 16:18.111
No, we're not.
Get lost, Will.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.146
Vince, this isn't you.

16:19.246 --> 16:21.148
Yes, it is.
Now leave me alone.

16:21.248 --> 16:22.615
Look, why won't
you let me help you?

16:22.715 --> 16:24.251
You are not
being true to yourself.

16:24.351 --> 16:26.119
You are not a waiter.
Yes, I am!

16:26.219 --> 16:27.254
I think we both
know you're a cop.

16:27.354 --> 16:28.355
Will, be quiet.

16:28.455 --> 16:29.489
I will not be quiet.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.324
You are a cop, Vince.
You are a cop!

16:31.424 --> 16:32.692
Cops! Let's go!

16:32.792 --> 16:35.695
Man, they're going for
the parking lot, move!

16:38.198 --> 16:39.999
Would you look at that.
He is a cop.

16:42.802 --> 16:45.405
By the way, I would
avoid the ricotta cheesecake.

16:45.505 --> 16:48.175
There was a cat
sitting on the box.

16:50.410 --> 16:51.778
Okay, come on.
Listen up.

16:51.878 --> 16:54.547
I have decided
to help you come out.

16:54.647 --> 16:57.016
All right?
I'm not gonna lie.

16:57.117 --> 16:59.286
I initially had
some reservations.

16:59.386 --> 17:02.021
Because it's such a huge
responsibility

17:02.122 --> 17:04.324
helping another person
through this journey?

17:04.424 --> 17:05.725
No...

17:05.825 --> 17:09.362
It's because you're not
what I call eye candy.

17:10.463 --> 17:14.434
Okay, you're more
eye pat candy.

17:14.534 --> 17:17.304
Are you being bitchy?
I heard of that.

17:17.404 --> 17:21.274
They do it all the time
on Designing Women.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.276
All right, the first step
in coming out

17:23.376 --> 17:24.611
is updating
your references.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.045
Okay?

17:26.146 --> 17:28.748
The seconds step
is telling your parents.

17:28.848 --> 17:31.151
I am so nervous, Jack.

17:31.251 --> 17:32.185
No, no, no, look.

17:32.285 --> 17:33.553
I know this is hard,

17:34.721 --> 17:36.156
but it's so much better
on the other side, I promise.

17:37.324 --> 17:38.425
Hey, why don't we start
with someone here, all right?

17:39.592 --> 17:40.493
You know, for practice.
Like, um, this guy over here.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.795
Excuse me, sir.
Could you come over here?

17:42.829 --> 17:44.097
Yeah, great.

17:45.198 --> 17:46.166
This gentleman has something
he'd like to tell you.

17:47.066 --> 17:47.367
Jack, I don't think--
No, no, no.

17:48.301 --> 17:48.701
Don't think about it.
Just blurt it out.

17:49.302 --> 17:50.303
All right?
Trust me.

17:51.104 --> 17:53.240
It'll make you feel better.
Go.

17:53.340 --> 17:54.474
Yeah, what is it?

17:55.775 --> 17:57.277
I'm gay!

17:57.377 --> 17:58.711
Oh, my God.

17:58.811 --> 18:01.148
Dad, you're gay?!

18:03.316 --> 18:04.751
Yes, Josh.

18:04.851 --> 18:07.086
And where did you
get that beer?

18:07.187 --> 18:09.789
Wow, two After School Specials
in one.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.562
Hey, I'm so sorry.

18:15.662 --> 18:17.330
I had no idea
you were undercover.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.232
It's okay, we caught him in,
like, two seconds.

18:19.332 --> 18:21.168
They were exhausted
from the lobster.

18:21.268 --> 18:22.235
It's got turkey in it.

18:22.335 --> 18:24.337
Ohh.

18:24.437 --> 18:27.174
So you're back
on the force, obviously.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.475
That's--that's great.

18:28.575 --> 18:30.410
Yeah, and I
made detective.

18:30.510 --> 18:31.511
Wow!

18:31.611 --> 18:33.480
I gotta tell you,
you know.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.482
I thought when we broke up
things sort of...

18:35.582 --> 18:36.883
fell apart for you.

18:36.983 --> 18:40.220
Yeah, no, actually,
things got better.

18:40.320 --> 18:43.122
Yeah, I mean, you know,
I got a promotion, right?

18:43.223 --> 18:44.857
I'm dating a great guy.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.193
Oh, and I just found out

18:46.293 --> 18:47.327
I got one foot
bigger than the other.

18:47.427 --> 18:50.263
So I got that going on,
you know.

18:50.363 --> 18:53.433
Well, it seems like things
are really going well for you.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.402
A guy, huh?

18:55.502 --> 18:57.470
Yeah.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.239
Hey, this is what
you wanted, right?

18:59.339 --> 19:01.374
For me to get
more independent

19:01.474 --> 19:02.575
and get my act together.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.211
Yeah, yeah, no, yeah.
I--I--

19:04.311 --> 19:05.678
I'm happy for you.

19:05.778 --> 19:06.779
Thanks.

19:08.915 --> 19:10.450
Well, I should go.

19:10.550 --> 19:14.153
Gotta go interrogate that
piece-of-crap drug dealer.

19:14.254 --> 19:15.655
I probably
don't have to worry

19:15.755 --> 19:18.258
about bagging up
his dinner, right?

19:18.358 --> 19:19.759
I already did.

19:23.430 --> 19:25.332
Will, it was really
good seeing you.

19:25.432 --> 19:27.166
Yeah.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.301
Yeah, you too.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.421
You okay?

19:50.557 --> 19:51.891
What happened with Vince?

19:51.991 --> 19:53.192
He's not a waiter.

19:53.293 --> 19:54.561
He's dating someone.

19:54.661 --> 19:56.429
And he's happy.

19:57.530 --> 20:00.867
Ohh, sweetie,
I'm sorry.

20:00.967 --> 20:04.704
It's hard to find out
that your ex is happy.

20:05.972 --> 20:08.308
Well...he's got one foot
bigger than the other,

20:08.408 --> 20:11.244
so, you know, it's not
all wine and roses.

20:13.580 --> 20:16.283
Did I make a mistake?

20:16.383 --> 20:17.717
Letting him go.

20:17.817 --> 20:20.520
I don't know
if it's possible

20:20.620 --> 20:22.922
to ever really know.

20:24.757 --> 20:27.560
Oh, come on,
11% is a generous tip!

20:27.660 --> 20:29.362
You know, I don't know
what is grosser about you,

20:29.462 --> 20:32.265
your cheapness or the tiramisu
you spit on the back of my neck!

20:32.365 --> 20:34.567
You make me sick!
You make me sick!

20:35.968 --> 20:37.404
Wow.

20:37.504 --> 20:38.471
I know.

20:40.507 --> 20:41.608
I did that.

20:41.708 --> 20:42.742
Ohh.

20:44.644 --> 20:46.613
Ha ha!
Palowski's Bail Bonds

20:46.713 --> 20:48.648
is goin'
to the semifinals!

20:48.748 --> 20:49.782
Whoo!
[cackling]

20:49.882 --> 20:53.620
You suck,
Mid-Marietta Hospital.

20:56.656 --> 20:59.258
Hey, Karen,
I'm such a good person.

20:59.359 --> 21:01.994
I helped that buxom old man.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.531
I can't wait to tell
his story on Jack Talk.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.499
I really do
feel like Oprah.

21:06.599 --> 21:07.667
Thank you, Jack.

21:07.767 --> 21:10.570
I feel alive
for the first time!

21:10.670 --> 21:10.770
Good for you!
