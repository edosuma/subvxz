00:04.994 --> 00:06.814
__

00:06.950 --> 00:09.186
Singleton, he has the votes
to remove you as captain.

00:09.252 --> 00:11.588
They think he has any idea how
to put money in their pockets?

00:11.661 --> 00:13.196
Landfall. We're home.

00:13.261 --> 00:15.797
- Is this English soil?
- It was once.

00:15.862 --> 00:17.766
- Whose is it?
- Ours.

00:17.831 --> 00:20.607
You screwed me tonight.
Flint, his captaincy, I had an interest.

00:20.672 --> 00:23.373
When the sea grows rough,
you come to Max.

00:23.438 --> 00:28.046
L'Urca de Lima.
Total cargo of $5 million.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.415
Take them into custody.

00:31.417 --> 00:33.048
What happened with Richard?

00:33.121 --> 00:36.485
Someone tore from this log
the very page necessary

00:36.550 --> 00:39.220
to discover that prize
and then stoked your resentment

00:39.285 --> 00:41.389
to make himself your captain.

00:44.095 --> 00:45.759
It's the stolen page.

00:45.832 --> 00:47.168
A whore for every
finger on your hand,

00:47.233 --> 00:49.033
but your eyes keep drifting to this.

00:49.106 --> 00:51.902
I think I have something
you might like to buy.

03:09.799 --> 03:12.931
When my father still lived here,
this place was a fucking mess.

03:13.004 --> 03:15.171
Men just fucked in tents,

03:15.236 --> 03:16.967
threw their shit in the streets.

03:18.567 --> 03:20.533
I wonder if he didn't notice
everyone living like animals

03:20.606 --> 03:22.004
or if he just didn't care.

03:22.069 --> 03:25.002
Why all this talk of your father?

03:25.075 --> 03:27.936
A man-o'-war was spotted yesterday.

03:28.009 --> 03:29.971
Royal Navy.

03:35.341 --> 03:36.908
What if today's the day?

03:36.980 --> 03:39.147
What if Scott
is downstairs right now

03:39.212 --> 03:40.811
waiting to give me the news?

03:40.884 --> 03:44.849
The British are back.
Decamp from Nassau.

03:44.914 --> 03:46.618
And then what?

03:46.683 --> 03:51.153
Then they blockade the island,
choke off trade.

03:51.226 --> 03:53.023
A few crews will resist,

03:53.088 --> 03:55.990
but how long can they survive
without my father's support?

03:56.055 --> 03:58.359
One by one their numbers
will dwindle.

03:58.432 --> 03:59.927
The fort will be abandoned.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.925
Soldiers will storm the beach.

04:03.564 --> 04:06.697
By the time the smoke clears,
my father will have arrived.

04:06.762 --> 04:09.865
First time he's set foot
here in five years

04:09.929 --> 04:12.735
waving the royal commission
that his bribes purchased

04:12.800 --> 04:14.271
and lording over the place.

04:14.336 --> 04:16.466
Round of applause,

04:16.531 --> 04:18.666
the new governor.

04:18.738 --> 04:22.601
Somewhere in London, some foul
fuck will get news of all of this,

04:22.674 --> 04:24.506
light his pipe and say,

04:24.571 --> 04:28.776
"Finally, all is right again
in Nassau."

04:30.279 --> 04:32.613
You say this as if it is certain.

04:34.709 --> 04:36.811
Perhaps you can buy this place.

04:36.884 --> 04:38.914
Nassau will need an inn.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.913
Max could be your partner.

04:40.986 --> 04:43.153
There is no finer host in the world.

04:43.218 --> 04:46.186
How will Mr. Noonan feel
when he hears of this plan?

04:46.259 --> 04:48.919
I think maybe soon
what Mr. Noonan feels

04:48.992 --> 04:51.359
will be of no concern to me.

04:53.824 --> 04:55.726
Yes?

04:55.799 --> 04:59.460
It's Scott. Can you let Mistress Guthrie
know she's needed?

04:59.533 --> 05:01.733
I'll be down in a minute.

05:03.564 --> 05:07.510
I think, perhaps, you may be
a little longer than that.

05:10.778 --> 05:11.881
<i>Viens ici.</i>

05:33.673 --> 05:35.567
Where is he?

05:38.637 --> 05:41.203
Says he wants to be the first
one Flint sees when it's done.

05:43.540 --> 05:45.337
Prize master's in the tent.

06:06.224 --> 06:08.465
Show us the color of the gold!

06:11.866 --> 06:14.137
Rum and snatch for each and all.

06:14.202 --> 06:17.840
Gentlemen, I understand your excitement,

06:17.905 --> 06:20.069
but do we really think
it is a good idea

06:20.142 --> 06:23.277
to open up what are,
to be fair, depleted reserves

06:23.342 --> 06:25.846
and start spending money
we haven't earned yet?

06:25.910 --> 06:27.708
- Money we haven't earned yet?
- Gentlemen.

06:30.482 --> 06:31.880
Gold for the whores!

06:34.279 --> 06:36.180
Billy.

06:36.245 --> 06:39.777
Billy. Billy.

06:49.690 --> 06:51.794
Jesus.

06:51.859 --> 06:54.790
What did I do?

07:05.195 --> 07:07.088
Have some whores!

07:10.063 --> 07:11.590
Drinks and whores!

07:11.663 --> 07:14.165
We don't like thieves.

07:15.863 --> 07:18.033
Beg pardon?

07:18.106 --> 07:20.304
You shouldn't steal.

07:23.306 --> 07:25.440
That's what happens.

07:29.343 --> 07:31.278
I see that.

07:36.453 --> 07:38.683
I'm hungry.

07:40.156 --> 07:43.922
All right. I'll see what I can do.

07:46.690 --> 07:49.058
You mustn't steal.

07:49.131 --> 07:51.794
He wasn't no thief, Randall.

07:53.930 --> 07:56.201
Here.

07:56.266 --> 07:58.273
Not now.

07:58.338 --> 08:00.410
Don't be stupid.

08:05.684 --> 08:08.008
The schedule is here on the island.

08:08.081 --> 08:09.343
How do you know?

08:09.416 --> 08:13.783
Whoever stole it
came back to read the log,

08:13.848 --> 08:16.425
find out exactly
what it was they had.

08:16.490 --> 08:19.688
Someone on that deck
out there is our thief.

08:19.761 --> 08:21.525
Well, it can't be one of our men.

08:21.590 --> 08:23.219
How would they have
known to look for it?

08:23.292 --> 08:26.596
And the men taken from the
prize were all searched.

08:28.596 --> 08:29.994
What?

08:30.067 --> 08:32.033
The cook.
I found him hiding in the armory

08:32.097 --> 08:33.529
standing over a dead body.

08:33.602 --> 08:35.265
Said it was suicide.

08:35.337 --> 08:37.169
Did you search him?

08:41.475 --> 08:42.943
Hold that boat.

08:43.008 --> 08:45.269
- There will be another.
- I'm sure you're right, but...

08:45.341 --> 08:48.307
I understand everyone
wants to get laid,

08:48.372 --> 08:50.610
but we disembark by seniority.

08:50.675 --> 08:52.577
Perhaps if you made
the men some food,

08:52.642 --> 08:56.178
it would take the edge off the
spree they're about to go on.

09:08.527 --> 09:09.956
Careful.

09:10.021 --> 09:12.155
Unless you want everybody
to know what he's got.

09:37.316 --> 09:39.114
Where the fuck is he going?

09:40.324 --> 09:42.621
Ah!

09:44.126 --> 09:45.460
Ooh!

09:49.425 --> 09:52.327
That kid must really
want to get laid.

09:57.595 --> 09:59.993
Come on, give us your hand.

10:13.773 --> 10:15.973
I know it's late.

10:23.919 --> 10:25.549
For Max.

10:25.622 --> 10:27.052
What happened to you?

10:27.117 --> 10:29.156
She worked late
with the Ranger crew.

10:29.221 --> 10:31.990
Noonan know about this?
He's just gonna let it go?

10:32.063 --> 10:33.830
50 pieces they paid her.

10:33.895 --> 10:36.533
That's worth a few nicks
to the hull, wouldn't you say?

10:36.598 --> 10:38.667
I have news.

10:38.732 --> 10:40.700
Please tell me it's the good kind.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.900
A crew of 10 have just
arrived out of Carolina.

10:42.973 --> 10:45.668
Captain's waiting for us
at the warehouse.

10:45.741 --> 10:47.506
He bring a prize with him?

10:47.571 --> 10:51.175
50 barrels of tobacco and a
fluyt's worth of rare silks.

10:51.240 --> 10:52.672
Let's go say hello.

10:52.745 --> 10:56.342
I had hoped we'd have a word first

10:56.407 --> 10:58.342
before we start work.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.952
You walked away from me last night

11:07.025 --> 11:09.287
and did something very foolish

11:09.360 --> 11:12.323
to a man whose temper you can
no longer afford to provoke.

11:12.388 --> 11:13.625
He moved on Flint.
I responded.

11:13.690 --> 11:17.055
And what did that accomplish?

11:17.128 --> 11:19.390
It made me feel better.

11:19.463 --> 11:22.059
Eleanor,

11:22.124 --> 11:24.430
you can never forget
who these men are.

11:24.495 --> 11:26.564
They are not our friends.

11:26.630 --> 11:28.363
They are not our subjects.

11:28.436 --> 11:30.098
They want your father's business.

11:30.163 --> 11:33.201
That is the only reason we do not
find their knives at our throats.

11:35.137 --> 11:36.936
Tell me you understand.

11:39.072 --> 11:42.311
Be honest, is it bad?

12:02.746 --> 12:05.685
5,000 pesos in pearls.

12:08.121 --> 12:10.391
Don't leave much in the reserves.

12:10.456 --> 12:13.557
An investment, if you'll allow.

12:16.094 --> 12:17.525
Good morning, Captain.

12:19.326 --> 12:20.596
What are you up to, Jack?

12:20.661 --> 12:22.099
There's been a development.

12:22.164 --> 12:24.465
It seems that Captain Flint
has for weeks

12:24.530 --> 12:27.526
been chasing a piece of information
that would enable the bearer

12:27.599 --> 12:30.631
to know the precise whereabouts
of the Spanish treasure galleon

12:30.704 --> 12:32.935
Urca de Lima.

12:36.238 --> 12:37.667
And you know this how?

12:37.740 --> 12:39.337
Because the thief
who stole it from him

12:39.402 --> 12:41.337
has offered to sell it to me.

12:41.410 --> 12:43.178
- You've met this person?
- His agent.

12:43.243 --> 12:44.978
The thief's too smart
to show us his face.

12:45.043 --> 12:49.146
He's asking 5,000 pesos
for a chance at five million.

12:50.619 --> 12:53.647
I'm sorry,
have I said something funny?

12:53.720 --> 12:56.213
You'd empty our reserves
to purchase what?

12:56.286 --> 12:58.715
A scrap of paper someone told
you may be worth something?

12:58.788 --> 12:59.850
They have no reason to lie to me.

12:59.915 --> 13:02.448
They have 5,000 reasons
to lie to you.

13:02.483 --> 13:05.750
Please tell me
I don't need to explain further.

13:05.822 --> 13:07.957
Well, I doubt the crew
will share your sentiments

13:08.022 --> 13:09.821
with what they stand to gain.

13:09.894 --> 13:12.659
Unless you have a score
of your own to present.

13:12.725 --> 13:16.829
Or are we to sit here patiently waiting
for Eleanor Guthrie to arrive,

13:16.894 --> 13:18.698
place one at our feet?

13:18.764 --> 13:22.005
Remind me how many leads
have the Guthries brought us

13:22.070 --> 13:24.037
since you two had your falling out?

13:26.476 --> 13:29.335
Please tell me I don't
have to explain further.

13:38.852 --> 13:41.590
Find me when Singleton's
back and it's done.

13:47.830 --> 13:50.197
The fuck's his problem?

13:50.262 --> 13:51.702
He thought that Flint
was the only one

13:51.767 --> 13:54.904
standing in the way
of his being crowned king.

13:54.969 --> 13:57.008
He thought wrong.

14:21.129 --> 14:23.590
Hey, friend, can you point
me to the blacksmith?

14:23.663 --> 14:25.494
- Which way to the butcher?
- In the square.

14:25.559 --> 14:27.526
I need a new shirt.

14:35.298 --> 14:38.768
Hey, anybody know
where the cook went?

14:38.833 --> 14:40.870
- That way.
- That way.

14:42.038 --> 14:43.868
Oh, Jesus.

14:43.933 --> 14:45.940
What do we do?

14:46.005 --> 14:48.772
Don't get too comfortable
in there, you twats.

14:48.845 --> 14:51.276
A couple of fucks
and you're back on this beach.

14:51.341 --> 14:54.116
We got a score to chase.

14:57.979 --> 15:00.712
I want to fuck, Max.

15:02.848 --> 15:04.887
- Max.
- Yes?

15:04.952 --> 15:08.516
- I want to fuck.
- You know the rules.

15:08.589 --> 15:10.156
That bitch keeps you all to herself.

15:10.221 --> 15:12.060
And she pays for the privilege.

15:13.757 --> 15:15.723
It's not fair.

15:17.828 --> 15:19.795
It's not... it's not f...

15:19.868 --> 15:21.435
it's... it's not fair.

15:21.500 --> 15:22.602
It's not...

15:22.667 --> 15:25.337
- What are you doing?
- Apologies.

15:25.403 --> 15:27.336
Don't let me interrupt.

15:27.401 --> 15:28.903
Wait your fucking turn!

15:28.968 --> 15:31.403
Certainly.

15:34.975 --> 15:37.079
Outside!

15:37.144 --> 15:39.077
Okay.

15:39.142 --> 15:42.011
Okay, this is going to require
a bit of an explanation.

15:42.076 --> 15:43.516
Fuck.

15:43.582 --> 15:44.750
Come back later, mon cher.

15:52.461 --> 15:54.557
Have you no decency?

15:57.862 --> 16:00.429
Who do you think you are that
you can cost me this money?

16:00.502 --> 16:02.300
Necessary, I'm afraid.

16:02.364 --> 16:04.299
We have a problem.

16:04.372 --> 16:06.299
- Flint's onto me.
- And so you come here?

16:06.371 --> 16:08.433
- What if you were followed?
- No, I was careful.

16:08.506 --> 16:10.537
Careful? You just told
me you've been caught.

16:10.610 --> 16:12.041
Well, that's true.

16:12.106 --> 16:14.838
You fucked me.

16:14.911 --> 16:16.541
There's no need to panic.

16:16.606 --> 16:18.045
We can still make the deal and...

16:18.110 --> 16:19.646
And then what?

16:19.711 --> 16:22.281
How long before Flint discovers
I had a part in this?

16:22.354 --> 16:23.754
When a man is being fucked,

16:23.819 --> 16:26.089
he wants to know
whose cock was in him.

16:26.154 --> 16:28.190
True, but by that time,

16:28.255 --> 16:31.188
these two cocks will be in a
boat halfway to Port Royal.

16:31.253 --> 16:33.219
Port Royal?

16:33.292 --> 16:36.056
After I get payment,
we meet at the boat

16:36.121 --> 16:37.960
in the cove and leave tonight.

16:40.695 --> 16:43.091
Unless there's something
else keeping you here.

16:47.331 --> 16:50.532
I was told Richard Guthrie
was the fence in Nassau.

16:50.605 --> 16:52.237
Brought his ships down from Boston.

16:52.302 --> 16:54.870
Hides his plunder in sugar barrels.

16:54.943 --> 16:57.342
But unless he went
and sprouted tits,

16:57.407 --> 16:58.940
you're not him.

17:00.981 --> 17:02.981
I'm his daughter Eleanor.

17:03.046 --> 17:05.849
I run the operation here
alongside my retainer Mr. Scott.

17:05.915 --> 17:08.787
A schoolgirl and a sugar monkey.

17:10.882 --> 17:12.951
We pay in coin, trade, or credit

17:13.016 --> 17:15.285
the moment your goods
enter my warehouse.

17:15.351 --> 17:17.959
And while we're off selling it at
rates you couldn't hope to match,

17:18.023 --> 17:21.522
you and your men get to enjoy the many
pleasantries Nassau has to offer.

17:21.588 --> 17:23.124
And what will that cost us exactly?

17:23.196 --> 17:27.392
- Around four reales on the dollar.
- Half our profits go to you?

17:27.457 --> 17:29.159
At first.

17:29.224 --> 17:32.030
But the more you earn,
the better the terms.

17:32.095 --> 17:34.937
Oh, you enjoy setting terms, do you?

17:35.002 --> 17:37.799
Since I sprouted tits.

17:37.872 --> 17:41.300
Well, Port Royal is not that far.

17:41.373 --> 17:43.838
I think I'll keep
my haul and my profits.

17:43.911 --> 17:46.174
- No offense.
- None taken.

17:46.247 --> 17:48.543
Though you might want to keep
that decision to yourself.

17:48.608 --> 17:49.675
And why is that?

17:49.748 --> 17:51.315
Because the last fool
who turned her down

17:51.380 --> 17:53.082
was never seen or heard from again.

17:53.147 --> 17:56.015
Though the same can't
be said for his plunder.

17:56.080 --> 17:59.489
A seller brought it to Mistress Guthrie
the very next day.

18:00.786 --> 18:03.322
And that seller would be you?

18:03.395 --> 18:05.427
Well, perhaps you'll find me
more of a match

18:05.492 --> 18:08.128
than that other craven bastard.

18:08.193 --> 18:11.927
James Bridge of the Demeter.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.397
Charles Vane of the Ranger.

18:22.574 --> 18:26.205
The Negro gentleman
takes our goods, does he?

18:29.243 --> 18:31.711
- Come on. We're off. Come on.
- Let's go.

18:39.319 --> 18:41.045
That wasn't necessary.

18:41.118 --> 18:43.150
But fun, nonetheless.

18:45.394 --> 18:47.328
I'd like a word in private.

18:47.393 --> 18:49.222
We have some business
to get sorted.

18:51.663 --> 18:52.997
Wonderful.

19:04.574 --> 19:06.541
I don't have time for this,
so if there's something...

19:06.606 --> 19:08.076
I want to talk about our business.

19:11.211 --> 19:15.576
I noticed lately that my crew

19:15.649 --> 19:18.614
hasn't been given the same
kind of information from you

19:18.679 --> 19:22.150
about potential prizes
that we once did.

19:23.583 --> 19:26.528
That others currently do receive.

19:28.024 --> 19:30.093
You've noticed that, have you?

19:30.158 --> 19:32.524
I believe it to be personal

19:32.597 --> 19:34.764
and I'd like to put an end to it.

19:37.165 --> 19:39.933
Things were better... are better

19:40.006 --> 19:41.637
for the both of us

19:41.702 --> 19:46.074
when you and I are on
the same side of things.

19:47.675 --> 19:49.611
I would like to return to that.

19:49.676 --> 19:52.312
You have an odd way of showing it.

19:52.377 --> 19:54.313
Excuse me?

19:54.378 --> 19:57.246
I have responsibilities here...

19:57.311 --> 19:59.614
commerce to oversee,
profits to maintain.

19:59.679 --> 20:01.687
The idea that I would
withhold valuable leads

20:01.752 --> 20:03.550
for personal reasons
is fucking absurd.

20:03.622 --> 20:05.253
Is that so?

20:05.318 --> 20:06.590
I stopped providing you
with intelligence

20:06.655 --> 20:08.696
because I don't like
the way you run your ship.

20:08.761 --> 20:12.060
Your men are undisciplined, unruly.

20:12.125 --> 20:15.058
For as much money as they bring in,
they cause twice as much damage.

20:15.131 --> 20:17.560
They're fucking animals.
You encourage it.

20:17.625 --> 20:19.725
And that makes you
a poor investment.

20:19.790 --> 20:21.856
You expect me to believe
this is about business?

20:21.921 --> 20:24.096
I don't give a fuck what you believe.

20:24.161 --> 20:26.593
I know that last night...
last night,

20:26.666 --> 20:29.631
you killed a member of a crew
that has value to me

20:29.696 --> 20:32.737
in order to depose a captain
that has value to me.

20:34.036 --> 20:36.937
And now not only do you
expect to be forgiven,

20:37.010 --> 20:38.545
you wish to be rewarded for it.

20:38.611 --> 20:40.644
Flint's so weak he needed
protection from you

20:40.716 --> 20:42.613
and I'm the poor investment?

20:42.686 --> 20:47.281
From where I sit, you coming here
means one of two things.

20:47.354 --> 20:49.448
Either you're under the
illusion that with Flint gone,

20:49.521 --> 20:52.623
I have no other choice
than to give you what you want

20:52.688 --> 20:54.917
or you think because
you and I used to fuck,

20:54.990 --> 20:57.156
you can cross me
without any consequences.

20:59.787 --> 21:02.323
I'm not sure which of
the two is more stupid.

21:04.995 --> 21:06.498
Be careful, Eleanor.

21:06.563 --> 21:08.635
Fuck you, Charles.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.505
Captain says we're gonna be rich!

21:20.273 --> 21:22.710
Son of a bitch. You made it.

21:24.214 --> 21:25.541
I did.

21:25.614 --> 21:27.477
What happened?
I thought Singleton had the votes.

21:27.550 --> 21:31.249
Turns out Mr. Singleton
was unfit for command.

21:31.314 --> 21:34.043
We have more pressing
issues to attend to.

21:34.108 --> 21:35.545
Shall I wait?

21:36.842 --> 21:38.809
Captain Vane was just leaving.

21:52.687 --> 21:56.251
Hey, what the fuck
happened on that ship?

21:56.316 --> 21:58.313
Where is Singleton?

21:59.384 --> 22:01.852
Fruit. Fruit.

22:01.917 --> 22:05.019
Tits. Tits.

22:05.084 --> 22:07.283
Plant. Plant.

22:07.356 --> 22:09.556
It's the fucking same.

22:09.621 --> 22:13.292
Yes, Captain, I'm sure
they look the same.

22:16.702 --> 22:18.869
What the hell are you doing?

22:18.934 --> 22:20.532
Watch this.

22:20.605 --> 22:23.436
As I explained, this is the
work of Adriaen Hanneman.

22:23.509 --> 22:25.340
A masterwork, unmistakably.

22:25.405 --> 22:29.211
This is an abomination.

22:29.276 --> 22:31.443
To suggest that the value of one
has any bearing on the other

22:31.516 --> 22:34.175
simply strains
the very bounds of reason.

22:38.878 --> 22:41.518
Fruit. Fruit.

22:41.583 --> 22:44.082
Tits. Tits.

22:45.252 --> 22:46.682
I love this town.

22:46.754 --> 22:49.654
I'm so glad you're entertained.

22:49.719 --> 22:52.749
I'm sorry, weren't we supposed
to be looking for the cook?

22:52.822 --> 22:55.989
- We are. Any luck?
- No, and I've looked all over.

22:56.054 --> 22:58.555
Meanwhile, you haven't moved
from this stump all day.

22:58.628 --> 23:01.362
Billy,

23:01.427 --> 23:03.363
take a load off.

23:03.428 --> 23:08.330
Fruit. Fruit. Tits. Tits.
Plant. Plant.

23:10.634 --> 23:12.568
I've always been straight
with you, haven't I?

23:12.633 --> 23:15.073
Never lied. Never hedged.

23:18.611 --> 23:20.745
You did the right thing.

23:23.881 --> 23:28.218
Yesterday when you sent me with
the captain to Harbour Island,

23:28.283 --> 23:32.118
you told me to restrain him
if he tried to go too far.

23:32.184 --> 23:34.021
I did.

23:34.086 --> 23:35.852
Singleton wasn't a thief.

23:35.925 --> 23:38.753
Flint baited him into that fight,
then he killed him.

23:38.818 --> 23:40.422
That's not going too far?

23:40.487 --> 23:42.558
Singleton was no saint.

23:42.623 --> 23:44.588
That's not the point.
The point is I lied to my own crew

23:44.653 --> 23:46.323
to protect the captain.

23:46.388 --> 23:48.655
You lied to protect the crew.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.159
You saw the Scarborough, mate.

23:50.224 --> 23:51.927
You know what's coming.

23:53.896 --> 23:56.761
We can't thieve forever.

23:59.135 --> 24:02.766
Flint said we need a king.

24:05.772 --> 24:07.267
Is that what you think?

24:08.836 --> 24:11.645
I think we need something.

24:11.710 --> 24:15.815
Five million pieces
is a good place to start.

24:18.121 --> 24:20.424
I guess we just keep looking, then.

24:20.488 --> 24:22.992
No need.

24:23.057 --> 24:24.487
- There's a man up there.
- Where?

24:24.560 --> 24:27.327
- The brothel.
- Ah, the brothel.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.767
Take them inside.

24:41.311 --> 24:43.309
Why are we following the appraiser?

24:43.374 --> 24:46.539
Because if I'm this cook and
I want to sell the schedule

24:46.612 --> 24:49.881
and leave this place a rich man,
I need two things...

24:49.946 --> 24:53.216
I need a boat and I need
a method of payment.

24:53.281 --> 24:55.150
A method of payment?

24:56.214 --> 24:57.917
What about gold coins?

24:57.982 --> 25:01.419
Gold is too heavy,
attracts too much attention.

25:01.484 --> 25:03.682
So I need a bill of exchange

25:03.755 --> 25:06.153
- or...
- Jewels.

25:06.218 --> 25:08.686
I was thinking pearls.

25:08.751 --> 25:12.785
And I'd want to know the exact
value of what I'm getting.

25:28.687 --> 25:30.294
Mr. Gates.

25:30.359 --> 25:31.788
Hello, boys.

25:31.861 --> 25:33.995
Where the fuck have you two been?

25:34.060 --> 25:36.661
Come join us.

25:36.734 --> 25:38.627
We'll be right with you.

25:38.700 --> 25:40.699
Any chance he's up
for a quick fuck?

25:42.100 --> 25:45.002
With Anne Bonny standing guard?

25:47.772 --> 25:50.612
Excellent luster and orient.

25:52.178 --> 25:55.010
Rest assured, young lady,
the quality is quite good.

25:55.082 --> 25:58.787
200 pieces of eight at any clearinghouse
in the civilized colonies.

26:00.655 --> 26:02.558
And the rest of them?

26:07.528 --> 26:10.091
- No offense.
- None taken.

26:17.566 --> 26:19.531
Sure I can't suck your cock
while you do that?

26:20.763 --> 26:23.033
Uh, thank you, no.

26:24.129 --> 26:27.273
Use my hand? Sing you a song?

26:27.338 --> 26:29.738
Something worth paying money for?

26:29.803 --> 26:31.506
Fucking peepers.

26:35.914 --> 26:37.545
My father's under arrest?

26:37.610 --> 26:39.544
A fugitive, technically.

26:39.617 --> 26:41.047
I have him on the Walrus.

26:41.112 --> 26:44.750
He was injured in the escape,
but he'll survive.

26:44.815 --> 26:47.022
Unfortunately, the same can't
be said for his reputation.

26:47.087 --> 26:49.653
This is impossible.

26:49.726 --> 26:52.219
He's been bribing
the Lords Proprietor for years.

26:52.292 --> 26:54.228
They've agreed to make
him governor here.

26:54.293 --> 26:57.365
It would appear they've had
a change of heart.

26:57.430 --> 26:59.330
You don't seem concerned about this.

26:59.395 --> 27:01.663
I never much liked your father.

27:01.728 --> 27:03.828
Too caught up in appearances.

27:03.893 --> 27:06.059
She's not talking about
your opinion of the man.

27:06.131 --> 27:08.098
Once news spreads
of Mr. Guthrie's arrest,

27:08.163 --> 27:09.960
our operation here
will no longer be viable.

27:10.033 --> 27:12.366
No legitimate port will have us.

27:12.431 --> 27:15.426
And his ships, the ships that
take your cargo to market,

27:15.499 --> 27:17.064
if they are not impounded already,

27:17.129 --> 27:19.064
will be on their way
back to Boston.

27:21.168 --> 27:25.266
Captain, we are finished here.

27:25.332 --> 27:28.900
Under normal circumstances,
I'd agree with you.

27:28.973 --> 27:31.938
- However...
- However what?

27:33.969 --> 27:37.242
Let me tell you a story

27:37.307 --> 27:39.239
about a Spaniard named Vazquez.

27:57.252 --> 27:59.051
Happy to be of service.

28:03.552 --> 28:05.781
Thank you for your patience
in these matters.

28:05.853 --> 28:08.355
You understand my partner
simply wishes to be careful.

28:08.420 --> 28:11.016
I wouldn't fault him
in the slightest.

28:11.089 --> 28:12.854
Now, shall we discuss delivery?

28:12.919 --> 28:15.189
The wrecks at sundown.

28:15.254 --> 28:18.217
Once he sees the pouch
with the seal unbroken,

28:18.290 --> 28:20.426
he will hand over the page.

28:36.739 --> 28:38.640
Is something wrong?

28:38.705 --> 28:40.671
It's unclear
which is more appealing,

28:40.744 --> 28:42.774
your beauty or your intelligence.

28:42.839 --> 28:44.912
You are very kind, monsieur.

28:44.977 --> 28:47.145
Well, let's not get carried away.

28:50.419 --> 28:52.722
You.

28:52.787 --> 28:53.922
Is there a problem, Captain?

28:53.987 --> 28:56.690
She doesn't have your page.
Flint does.

28:56.763 --> 28:59.057
He killed Singleton,
took it off his body.

28:59.130 --> 29:02.400
His crew's skipping around the island
like the prize is as good as theirs.

29:02.466 --> 29:04.952
That is impossible.
My partner has the page.

29:04.955 --> 29:05.992
What?

29:06.040 --> 29:08.374
Mr. Singleton is not the seller,
I assure you.

29:08.409 --> 29:10.617
- What did you just say?
- Charles.

29:10.682 --> 29:13.480
Shut up, Jack.
You really want to keep pushing this?

29:13.553 --> 29:16.373
- Play me for a fool?
- You are mistaken.

29:16.439 --> 29:17.874
Yeah, the fuck I am.

29:17.939 --> 29:19.407
I need a weapon.

29:19.472 --> 29:21.638
Tell me the truth.

29:21.711 --> 29:24.138
- The page is gone.
- No.

29:24.203 --> 29:26.104
Do you have a candlestick

29:26.169 --> 29:29.209
or perhaps a heavy shoe?

29:29.274 --> 29:31.409
- That'll do.
- Play me for a fucking fool?

29:31.482 --> 29:34.144
- You are mistaken.
- Yeah, the fuck I am.

29:34.217 --> 29:36.446
Don't fucking lie to me!

29:36.511 --> 29:38.981
She isn't lying, Charles.
Flint is.

29:39.046 --> 29:40.852
- What?
- He lost the page.

29:40.917 --> 29:42.584
So what does he do?
He bluffs.

29:42.649 --> 29:44.282
He makes Singleton
the thief and kills him

29:44.355 --> 29:45.818
to prevent counterargument,

29:45.883 --> 29:48.054
putting a tidy end
to his mutiny in the process,

29:48.120 --> 29:50.719
then hopes he can recover it
before anyone's the wiser.

29:50.792 --> 29:53.160
Honestly, Charles, are we
to believe that Singleton,

29:53.226 --> 29:55.527
while conspiring with you
to depose Flint,

29:55.592 --> 29:58.493
was using this whore to try and
bilk your crew out of its money?

29:58.558 --> 29:59.796
Say what you want about Singleton,

29:59.861 --> 30:01.827
but he was neither
that clever nor that dumb.

30:01.893 --> 30:04.565
Now will you please put her down so
we can complete our transaction?

30:04.638 --> 30:07.437
Is that what you thought?
You could fuck us out of our money

30:07.502 --> 30:09.173
and then hide behind Eleanor?

30:09.238 --> 30:11.340
You think I'd really let that happen?

30:11.406 --> 30:13.644
You think I'm that fucking pathetic?

30:13.709 --> 30:15.877
Jesus, lady.

30:49.589 --> 30:53.015
Unless Mr. Singleton rose from
the grave to eavesdrop on us...

30:54.485 --> 30:56.450
it would appear
she's telling the truth.

30:59.355 --> 31:02.722
If he's wrong about this,
he'll answer to our crew.

31:02.787 --> 31:06.596
If you're lying,
you'll answer to me.

31:11.467 --> 31:13.369
Yes, all right.

31:17.473 --> 31:19.072
The Urca de Lima?

31:19.137 --> 31:20.336
That's correct.

31:20.409 --> 31:22.579
You're talking about
a floating castle.

31:22.644 --> 31:25.443
No one has ever taken a treasure
galleon like that as a prize.

31:25.515 --> 31:27.282
Let me worry about hunting her.

31:27.347 --> 31:29.752
It's what comes after
for which I'll need your help.

31:29.817 --> 31:32.554
After?
Why return at all to Nassau?

31:32.620 --> 31:35.658
With money like that and my father
out of business, why not run?

31:35.723 --> 31:38.890
What's coming our way
can't be outrun.

31:41.466 --> 31:45.299
But with the money
I strip from the Hulk,

31:45.371 --> 31:48.670
we could add 50 guns to the fort.

31:48.743 --> 31:50.943
We could build ships
to defend our shores

31:51.008 --> 31:53.141
and train new men to sail them.

31:54.382 --> 31:56.446
We could work the land,

31:56.519 --> 31:58.817
grow crops and raise cattle.

32:00.090 --> 32:02.193
Then whoever arrives
on our shores first,

32:02.258 --> 32:04.764
be it England or Spain,

32:04.829 --> 32:07.564
will be in for a most
unwelcome surprise.

32:09.839 --> 32:13.574
A nation of thieves.

32:16.247 --> 32:18.215
You have your doubts?

32:18.280 --> 32:22.043
Of turning pirates
into farmers and soldiers?

32:22.116 --> 32:26.112
Of fighting a war against Whitehall
from a sliver in the Atlantic?

32:26.185 --> 32:28.182
Doubt, Captain Flint,

32:28.247 --> 32:31.253
does not begin to describe
how I am feeling.

32:31.318 --> 32:34.515
If there's to be a war, that
will be Whitehall's choice.

32:34.588 --> 32:36.787
I'd settle for a pardon,
title on lands,

32:36.852 --> 32:38.290
and a governor that I could trust.

32:38.355 --> 32:39.953
And so would most
of the men out there.

32:40.026 --> 32:41.625
They're not animals, Mr. Scott.

32:41.690 --> 32:43.121
They're men starved of hope.

32:43.194 --> 32:45.053
Give that back to them,

32:45.126 --> 32:47.491
who's to say what could happen?

32:49.092 --> 32:51.258
Why do this?

32:51.324 --> 32:53.498
Why here?

32:54.698 --> 32:59.940
Odysseus,
on his journey home to Ithaca,

33:00.005 --> 33:01.667
was visited by a ghost.

33:03.506 --> 33:07.635
The ghost tells him
that once he reaches his home,

33:07.700 --> 33:10.909
once he slays all his enemies

33:10.974 --> 33:12.245
and sets his house in order,

33:12.310 --> 33:15.878
he must do one last thing
before he can rest.

33:15.951 --> 33:18.782
The ghost tells him
to pick up an oar

33:18.848 --> 33:21.253
and walk inland.

33:21.319 --> 33:23.287
And keep walking

33:23.360 --> 33:26.256
until somebody mistakes
that oar for a shovel.

33:27.961 --> 33:29.799
For that would be
the place that no man

33:29.864 --> 33:31.600
had ever been troubled by the sea.

33:33.368 --> 33:35.965
And that's where he'd find peace.

33:37.237 --> 33:39.134
In the end, that's all I want.

33:40.743 --> 33:43.909
To walk away from the sea
and find some peace.

33:48.382 --> 33:50.075
I think we found it.

33:50.148 --> 33:51.610
Found what?

33:51.682 --> 33:53.816
The Urca's schedule
was taken from me.

33:53.880 --> 33:56.111
When were you planning
on mentioning that?

33:56.184 --> 33:58.487
Everything's under control.
We're close to recovering it.

33:58.552 --> 34:00.253
Vane just met with Frasier
at the brothel.

34:00.318 --> 34:01.946
I assume he's the buyer.

34:02.019 --> 34:06.053
We missed the thief, but he's
using a whore as a go-between.

34:06.126 --> 34:08.353
I left Billy
to keep an eye on things.

34:08.418 --> 34:12.292
If we get moving, there's half a
chance to get in front of this.

34:12.364 --> 34:14.225
Find the cook...

34:26.675 --> 34:29.574
Good.
Maybe you can get her to talk.

34:29.639 --> 34:33.080
- I'm fine.
- Huh, the fuck you are.

34:33.145 --> 34:36.581
She nearly got herself
killed by Captain Vane.

34:36.647 --> 34:38.643
I want to know why.

34:38.717 --> 34:41.083
Leave us alone, Noonan.

34:42.851 --> 34:44.284
Come on.

34:57.974 --> 35:00.216
- Max, I...
- I'm glad you are here.

35:00.281 --> 35:02.351
I was going to send word for you.

35:02.416 --> 35:06.086
You and I have a decision to make
and it must be made right now.

35:06.151 --> 35:09.457
I'm about to receive a great deal
of money for a service I provided.

35:09.522 --> 35:12.130
Max, I need you
to give me the schedule.

35:12.195 --> 35:14.195
Flint's schedule.

35:15.964 --> 35:17.634
When you were talking
this morning about being free

35:17.699 --> 35:19.864
from Noonan,
that's what you meant, wasn't it?

35:19.937 --> 35:22.303
How do you know this?

35:22.368 --> 35:24.103
It doesn't matter.

35:24.168 --> 35:27.141
Max, Flint needs that page.

35:27.206 --> 35:29.143
The money he can get
from his prize,

35:29.208 --> 35:32.144
it can give this place a future.
It can give us a future here.

35:32.217 --> 35:35.519
If the page isn't delivered to Vane,
he will kill me.

35:37.121 --> 35:38.953
I can protect you.

35:39.026 --> 35:41.657
Scott can protect you.
You have to trust me.

35:45.496 --> 35:47.495
Leave with me.

35:47.560 --> 35:49.428
- What?
- I have a boat waiting.

35:49.493 --> 35:51.492
I will have enough money
for us to start anew.

35:51.565 --> 35:53.333
- But I can't leave here.
- Why not?

35:54.799 --> 36:00.606
Because I've spent my life
trying to build something here.

36:00.671 --> 36:02.710
It's all I have.
I can't just walk away.

36:02.775 --> 36:04.246
It is not all you have!

36:04.311 --> 36:07.582
Eleanor, this place is just sand.

36:07.647 --> 36:09.581
It cannot love you back.

36:09.646 --> 36:11.621
You know this.
You must know this.

36:12.854 --> 36:14.388
Your father left you.

36:14.454 --> 36:16.588
Your mother was taken from you.

36:16.653 --> 36:18.722
Everyone you have
ever loved you have lost

36:18.787 --> 36:21.026
and it terrifies you.

36:21.091 --> 36:22.458
But not me.

36:22.523 --> 36:25.995
I will never, ever leave you.

36:26.068 --> 36:28.236
I love you.

36:31.501 --> 36:34.110
Miss Guthrie.

36:38.345 --> 36:41.121
- You brought them here?
- I...

36:49.703 --> 36:52.502
Come with me. Right now.

36:52.567 --> 36:55.742
The boat is waiting.
We can be free of this place.

36:55.807 --> 36:58.205
We can have a life together.

36:58.278 --> 37:00.175
And it can start this very minute.

37:00.248 --> 37:02.848
All you have to do is say yes.

37:05.587 --> 37:07.322
Set us both free.

37:16.023 --> 37:17.523
Come in.

37:27.067 --> 37:29.297
Max, I need you to tell me
where the page is.

37:32.140 --> 37:33.909
And if I don't, then what?

37:38.586 --> 37:41.290
This doesn't have to go badly.

37:41.355 --> 37:42.924
I want her to say it.

37:42.997 --> 37:45.363
I want her to say that
she would sit there and watch

37:45.428 --> 37:48.597
as you beat the answer
out of me to save this place.

37:49.998 --> 37:51.734
Say it.

37:58.113 --> 37:59.947
Say it.

38:09.320 --> 38:11.423
The wrecks at sundown.

38:22.742 --> 38:24.613
- Max, please.
- Get the fuck out.

38:24.678 --> 38:26.445
I meant what I said.
I can protect you.

38:26.510 --> 38:28.578
Get the fuck out!

39:21.357 --> 39:23.860
- Frightened, Jack?
- Please.

39:23.932 --> 39:26.398
There's nothing in there
but opium addicts,

39:26.471 --> 39:29.899
lunatics, and men who thought
themselves too good to wear a condom.

40:10.906 --> 40:13.113
The pearls.

40:13.178 --> 40:16.116
He says you give me the pearls.

40:19.689 --> 40:22.824
Did he say anything else?

40:32.202 --> 40:34.270
No. I want him out here.

40:34.335 --> 40:36.405
Captain.

40:36.470 --> 40:38.604
I know you can hear me!

40:38.669 --> 40:41.340
You want your money,
you show your fucking face!

40:41.405 --> 40:43.810
That's the only way this gets done.

40:46.978 --> 40:48.713
Captain, I'm afraid
our friend out there

40:48.779 --> 40:50.784
has all the leverage in
this particular situation.

40:50.849 --> 40:53.051
Now, we can rail and shout
and stamp our feet,

40:53.116 --> 40:55.252
but that doesn't change the fact
that unless we give this fellow...

41:05.734 --> 41:07.334
You were saying?

41:10.809 --> 41:14.649
Now, come out here and face me

41:14.714 --> 41:16.914
or these pearls go back
where they belong!

41:18.756 --> 41:20.019
Fuck.

41:23.258 --> 41:25.456
Charles, it is important

41:25.521 --> 41:27.327
this deal goes through tonight.

41:27.392 --> 41:30.557
This is a potential prize
that changes everything for us.

41:30.630 --> 41:34.132
Do not scuttle it by...

41:51.214 --> 41:55.121
He says you give me the pearls.

44:20.921 --> 44:22.320
Ah!

45:03.033 --> 45:05.640
- Where's the page?
- You can't have it.

45:05.705 --> 45:08.872
Not at the moment.
And, please, we should go.

45:08.945 --> 45:10.008
Where have you hidden it?

45:11.176 --> 45:12.774
You're looking at it.

45:12.847 --> 45:14.712
What the fuck
are you talking about?

45:14.785 --> 45:18.615
Well, I couldn't be certain I would
escape both the madman and you,

45:18.688 --> 45:21.628
so I took drastic measures

45:21.693 --> 45:23.827
for the sake of my survival.

45:28.733 --> 45:32.500
Your schedule is up here.

45:50.615 --> 45:52.052
Fuck!

45:53.221 --> 45:54.822
You don't have to do this.

45:57.458 --> 46:00.494
Mr. Noonan has men at your door.

46:00.559 --> 46:03.064
And Guthrie's put
three more downstairs.

46:07.003 --> 46:08.842
Vane can't get to you here.

46:08.907 --> 46:10.842
I know.

46:10.907 --> 46:12.979
But I cannot stay.

46:16.813 --> 46:18.683
Will you help me?

47:12.752 --> 47:14.583
Meet our thief.

47:14.655 --> 47:18.254
- Why is he still alive?
- It's a long story.

47:18.319 --> 47:20.560
Do you mind if we stash
him here for the night?

47:20.625 --> 47:22.665
Billy can stand guard.

47:46.487 --> 47:48.855
Flint will want
our answer in the morning.

47:50.856 --> 47:53.761
I know you don't approve of this,

47:53.826 --> 47:55.634
but I need to do this.

47:55.699 --> 47:57.130
I need it.

48:05.571 --> 48:07.545
Please.

48:09.579 --> 48:11.547
Stay with me.

48:14.590 --> 48:16.087
All right.

49:54.267 --> 49:56.168
Take off your boots.

49:56.233 --> 49:57.903
I'll boil some water.
