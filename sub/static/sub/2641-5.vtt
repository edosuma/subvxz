00:02.124 --> 00:05.776
All right, Raj has played
his phantom warlord card,

00:05.844 --> 00:10.614
and I am going to back him
up with my strangling vines.

00:11.483 --> 00:14.151
Choke on that, sucka.

00:14.219 --> 00:19.056
Okay, well, then I'll just cut
your vines with my ruby sword.

00:19.124 --> 00:22.994
That's right,
I did it. I cut 'em.

00:23.061 --> 00:25.847
Um...

00:25.914 --> 00:27.815
I have a question.

00:27.900 --> 00:31.569
Warlord beats troll,
troll beats elf,

00:31.636 --> 00:32.904
elf beats water sprite,

00:32.971 --> 00:36.440
and basically everything
beats enchanted bunny.

00:36.508 --> 00:38.476
Unless you have the carrot power.

00:38.544 --> 00:41.612
Okay, I've got another question.

00:41.663 --> 00:43.631
When does this get fun?

00:43.699 --> 00:45.583
Are we going to talk

00:45.650 --> 00:48.536
or are we going to play
"Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah"?

00:48.604 --> 00:50.838
Just play potion card.

00:50.923 --> 00:52.306
Which one?

00:52.341 --> 00:53.341
It doesn't matter.

00:53.425 --> 00:55.526
You can't possibly win.

00:55.594 --> 00:56.677
Sheldon, don't ruin the game.

00:56.762 --> 00:58.129
How could he ruin the game?

00:58.180 --> 00:59.881
Given the cards that have
already been played,

00:59.965 --> 01:01.549
Penny can only be holding
necromancer potions,

01:01.633 --> 01:03.634
which are only effective against
wraiths and day-walkers,

01:03.685 --> 01:05.953
and there are no more
of either left to be drawn.

01:06.021 --> 01:07.972
The cards remaining in
the undrawn stack are:

01:08.040 --> 01:12.326
four fire weapons, a troll, two
ogres and the jewel of Osiris.

01:12.361 --> 01:14.645
See? Ruined.

01:14.696 --> 01:17.481
Sheldon, that is incredible.

01:17.549 --> 01:20.668
From your vantage point,
it certainly must seem so.

01:20.736 --> 01:23.871
Sheldon has kind of
a photographic memory.

01:23.956 --> 01:25.990
"Photographic" is a misnomer.

01:26.041 --> 01:28.876
I have an eidetic memory,
as I've told you many times.

01:28.961 --> 01:31.078
Most recently last year during lunch

01:31.163 --> 01:32.863
on the afternoon of may seventh.

01:34.099 --> 01:36.500
You had turkey and
complained it was dry.

01:36.568 --> 01:38.336
Well, I guess game's over.

01:38.387 --> 01:40.304
Really? Oh, great.

01:41.089 --> 01:43.808
I mean, aw.

01:44.676 --> 01:46.727
Okay, I gotta go.
Why?

01:46.812 --> 01:48.262
Because the last me I didn't go,

01:48.347 --> 01:51.098
I ended up playing
"mystic warlords of ka."

01:51.183 --> 01:53.868
Not "Ka. Ka-ah."

01:53.936 --> 01:56.070
Buh-eye.

01:56.154 --> 01:58.155
See ya.

01:59.741 --> 02:01.909
Still can't believe
she's going out with me.

02:01.994 --> 02:03.661
Nobody can.

02:05.080 --> 02:07.531
That reminds me, I have
a bone to pick with you.

02:07.599 --> 02:08.282
What?

02:08.366 --> 02:10.234
You and I made a pact

02:10.285 --> 02:12.703
that if either of us
ever got a hot girlfriend,

02:12.754 --> 02:14.205
That person would have his girlfriend

02:14.256 --> 02:15.423
hook the other guy up

02:15.507 --> 02:17.425
with one of her girlfriends.

02:17.509 --> 02:19.460
I don't remember that.

02:19.544 --> 02:21.862
June 30th, 2004.

02:21.930 --> 02:25.416
Opening day of spider-man 2
at the AMC Pasadena.

02:25.467 --> 02:29.120
They only had red icees,
no blue.

02:29.187 --> 02:30.554
Oh, yeah.

02:30.605 --> 02:33.190
So you've been with Penny for
like a month and a half now.

02:33.258 --> 02:34.709
Where's my shorty, Morty?

02:34.776 --> 02:38.229
Howard, you can't hold me to that.

02:38.280 --> 02:39.447
Why not?

02:39.531 --> 02:40.815
Because when I made that agreement,

02:40.899 --> 02:42.616
I didn't think I'd ever
have a hot girlfriend.

02:42.701 --> 02:44.035
And I was positive you never would.

02:45.287 --> 02:47.955
Hey, how come I wasn't
part of this deal?

02:48.040 --> 02:50.274
You had left the refreshment
stand in order to indulge

02:50.325 --> 02:53.244
in your customary preemptive
pre-show urination.

02:53.295 --> 02:55.129
Oh, so that's how it works?

02:55.213 --> 02:58.615
I have a teeny bladder and now
I don't get a hot girlfriend?

02:58.667 --> 03:01.752
Yeah, Raj.
That's how it works.

03:01.803 --> 03:04.305
Damn.

03:04.389 --> 03:07.842
<i>* Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state *</i>

03:07.909 --> 03:11.062
<i>* then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! *</i>

03:11.129 --> 03:12.697
<i>* The earth began to cool *</i>

03:12.764 --> 03:15.366
<i>* the autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals develop tools *</i>

03:15.434 --> 03:17.868
<i>* we built the wall *
* we built the pyramids *</i>

03:17.936 --> 03:20.571
<i>* math, science, history,
unraveling the mystery *</i>

03:20.639 --> 03:22.540
<i>* that all started with a big bang*</i>

03:22.541 --> 03:24.158
<i>* bang! *</i>

03:31.054 --> 03:33.538
Oh, damn it.
Can I have a napkin?

03:34.341 --> 03:37.026
I'm sorry, no.

03:37.094 --> 03:39.529
But you have a whole bunch of 'em.

03:39.596 --> 03:43.065
Yes, I've moved to a four-napkin system.

03:43.150 --> 03:45.736
Lap, hands,
face and personal emergencies.

03:47.821 --> 03:49.539
If you like,
starting tomorrow,

03:49.543 --> 03:50.574
I'll add a guest napkin,

03:51.658 --> 03:54.560
but I'm afraid there's nothing
I can do for you today.

03:57.698 --> 04:00.232
Good luck.
That's the face napkin.

04:01.936 --> 04:03.486
So, have you talked to Penny yet?

04:03.554 --> 04:04.637
No, I haven't.

04:04.688 --> 04:05.555
Why not?

04:06.140 --> 04:08.441
Because I've been busy,
because I haven't figured out

04:08.493 --> 04:09.143
a way to bring it up,

04:10.227 --> 04:11.278
and mostly... and I can't
stress how key this is...

04:12.346 --> 04:14.531
because I don't want to.

04:14.615 --> 04:16.115
Leonard, a pact is a pact.

04:16.183 --> 04:18.151
You have to get Penny to fix me up.

04:18.235 --> 04:19.152
It's not that simple.

04:19.202 --> 04:19.320
What am I supposed to say?

04:19.370 --> 04:20.538
"Penny, do you have any friends

04:20.622 --> 04:22.989
you'd like to never hear from again?"

04:23.040 --> 04:25.208
Come on, I'm smart,

04:25.292 --> 04:29.695
I have good job and I have
only three percent body fat.

04:29.747 --> 04:30.914
It's true.

04:30.998 --> 04:31.499
I've seen him at the beach.

04:31.550 --> 04:34.717
He's like a human chicken wing.

04:34.802 --> 04:35.336
Leonard, come on.

04:36.387 --> 04:38.505
Fine.
I'll ask if she has a friend for you.

04:38.556 --> 04:39.672
Hot friend.

04:39.723 --> 04:40.840
Right.

04:40.891 --> 04:42.091
And tall.

04:42.176 --> 04:44.344
I want our kids to be able
to ride space mountain

04:44.345 --> 04:45.361
before they're 20.

04:45.429 --> 04:47.747
I'll see what I can do.

04:47.815 --> 04:49.866
Hey, Sheldon,
guess what I heard today?

04:49.934 --> 04:52.986
I'd imagine you heard
any number of things today.

04:53.053 --> 04:55.154
When you arrived at work you
undoubtedly heard, "hello, Raj."

04:55.222 --> 04:56.372
"How are you, Raj?"

04:56.440 --> 04:58.208
Given that you're wearing
a new sweater-vest,

04:58.209 --> 04:59.809
you may have heard "new sweater-vest?".

04:59.994 --> 05:02.529
And possibly, though far less
likely, "nice sweater-vest."

05:02.596 --> 05:06.049
Why don't I just tell
you what i heard today.

05:06.116 --> 05:08.868
That would probably save us some time.

05:08.919 --> 05:11.204
Saturday night at the comic book store,

05:11.255 --> 05:12.889
they're having a "mystic
warlords of ka-ah" tournament.

05:12.957 --> 05:15.375
First prize is $500.

05:15.426 --> 05:17.260
If we team up,
we'd be unstoppable.

05:17.344 --> 05:19.178
I'm sorry, Raj,
but I have no interest

05:19.246 --> 05:21.548
in playing a game in
which I find no challenge.

05:21.615 --> 05:22.799
What about the money?

05:22.883 --> 05:23.900
I have money.

05:23.968 --> 05:25.635
This is other money.

05:25.719 --> 05:28.087
How does it different
from the money I have?

05:28.155 --> 05:30.323
Half of it will be mine.

05:30.357 --> 05:33.743
Do you need it to buy a less
disturbing sweater-vest?

05:35.946 --> 05:37.146
Leonard, help.

05:37.231 --> 05:39.065
Are you kidding?

05:39.116 --> 05:42.352
I couldn't even talk him into
giving one of his freakin' napkins.

05:45.456 --> 05:50.126
Wow, you really are a genius.

05:50.194 --> 05:51.744
Not really.

05:51.795 --> 05:53.830
I googled how to do that.

05:58.802 --> 06:03.489
So, listen... have you ever
made a pact with someone?

06:06.977 --> 06:09.479
Okay, fine,
like a pinky swear.

06:09.546 --> 06:12.098
Well, in the first grade,
my friend Rosie and I

06:12.149 --> 06:13.933
made a pact to marry Bert and Ernie.

06:13.984 --> 06:16.603
You know, from Sesame Street?

06:16.654 --> 06:18.304
I'm familiar with Bert and Ernie.

06:19.605 --> 06:20.998
Knowing fact,
we both wanted Ernie.

06:21.325 --> 06:24.043
We didn't speak again
until middle school.

06:24.111 --> 06:25.828
Over puppets?

06:25.913 --> 06:29.182
The heart wants what
the heart wants, Leonard.

06:29.249 --> 06:30.433
Okay.

06:30.501 --> 06:33.453
Speaking of what the heart wants...

06:33.504 --> 06:36.072
Um, a long time ago,

06:36.140 --> 06:39.726
I made a pact with Wolowitz
that kind of involves you.

06:47.801 --> 06:51.971
Okay, I don't know where
you're going with this,

06:52.022 --> 06:57.009
but tread carefully because it may be
the last conversation we ever have.

06:57.061 --> 06:59.362
No, no, nothing like that.

06:59.446 --> 07:02.231
The deal was that if either
of us ever got a girlfriend,

07:02.316 --> 07:04.517
we'd have her fix the other one up

07:04.568 --> 07:06.336
with one of her friends.

07:07.337 --> 07:10.237
And you thought a good time to
bring this up be right after sex.

07:16.130 --> 07:19.799
And during, I was trying to remember
what I read on google, so...

07:22.836 --> 07:25.555
I'm not hooking Wolowitz up
with one of my friends.

07:25.639 --> 07:28.591
It doesn't have to be a good friend.

07:28.659 --> 07:32.829
And you know that deep down
inside, Howard's a really nice guy.

07:32.896 --> 07:35.598
The problem isn't what's on the inside.

07:35.683 --> 07:37.850
It's the creepy candy coating.

07:37.918 --> 07:41.521
Will you at least think about it?

07:41.588 --> 07:43.756
Just as a favor to me?

07:43.824 --> 07:47.577
Oh, great thing about Ernie,

07:47.661 --> 07:50.363
was he never asked me for anything.

07:50.464 --> 07:53.816
He just gave.

07:55.185 --> 08:00.790
Got it. Got it. Got it.
Got it. Got it. Got it.

08:00.874 --> 08:02.575
Betty and Veronica?

08:02.626 --> 08:05.294
Oh.

08:05.362 --> 08:08.097
Hey, Sheldon, the new Green Lantern
figurine's coming in tomorrow.

08:08.182 --> 08:09.382
Want me to set one aside for you?

08:09.433 --> 08:10.750
Thank you.

08:10.801 --> 08:12.802
You just robbed me of the opportunity

08:12.886 --> 08:14.587
to stumble upon the figurine

08:14.638 --> 08:16.355
and make the oh-so-satisfying journey

08:16.423 --> 08:17.890
from discovery to desire to possession.

08:17.941 --> 08:20.159
All right,
I won't set one aside for you.

08:20.227 --> 08:21.377
But I must have it.

08:21.445 --> 08:23.880
Okay, I'll set one aside for you.
Thank you.

08:23.947 --> 08:25.898
You know, I can buy
all these things online.

08:25.966 --> 08:28.251
I come here for the personal service.

08:31.605 --> 08:33.272
Hey, Stuart,
is the Wil Wheaton signed up

08:33.340 --> 08:34.307
For the mystic warlords tournament.

08:34.374 --> 08:36.909
The Wil Wheaton from Star Trek?

08:36.960 --> 08:39.145
Yeah, he lives around here.
Big gamer.

08:39.212 --> 08:40.563
Excuse me.

08:40.631 --> 08:44.400
Are you saying that Wil Wheaton
aka Ensign Wesley Crusher

08:44.501 --> 08:46.319
on Star Trek:
The next generation

08:46.386 --> 08:48.237
is going to be participating
in your tournament?

08:48.305 --> 08:52.592
Oh, I'm sorry, did I rob you
of the opportunity to stumble
onto that for yourself?

08:52.593 --> 08:53.826
You don't understand.

08:53.894 --> 08:57.480
Growing up,
I idolized Wil Wheaton?

08:57.564 --> 09:01.334
Wesley Crusher had an eidetic
memory just like me.

09:01.401 --> 09:02.468
Ooh, what a coincidence.

09:05.339 --> 09:07.440
Sign here.
I was such a fan

09:07.491 --> 09:10.860
that in 1995,
I traveled ten hours by bus

09:10.944 --> 09:13.079
to a sci-fi convention
in Jackson, Mississippi,

09:13.146 --> 09:15.281
wearing my star flee
academy cadet uniform

09:15.349 --> 09:17.166
in order to meet Wil Wheaton

09:17.251 --> 09:18.584
and get him to autograph

09:18.652 --> 09:20.953
my mint in-package Wesley
Crusher action figure..

09:21.021 --> 09:23.873
Ooh, it'll be like a reunion then.

09:23.941 --> 09:24.924
Sign here.

09:24.991 --> 09:26.142
My arduous journey, however,

09:26.210 --> 09:28.160
was for naught.

09:28.212 --> 09:30.847
Although advertised to appear,
he did not show up.

09:30.931 --> 09:34.150
It was at that moment, I vowed
eternal hatred for Wil Wheaton.

09:34.218 --> 09:36.602
Okay, great, you can
tell him you hate him.

09:36.670 --> 09:37.904
Sign here.

09:37.971 --> 09:40.940
It might also interest you
to know that Wil Wheaton

09:41.007 --> 09:43.726
currently ranks sixth on
my a-time enemies list...

09:43.811 --> 09:45.728
right between director Joel Schumacher,

09:45.813 --> 09:47.730
Who nearly destroyed
the Batman movie franchise,

09:47.798 --> 09:49.699
and Billy Sparks,

09:49.783 --> 09:51.350
who lived down the street from me

09:51.401 --> 09:53.486
and put dog poop on the
handles of my bicycle.

09:53.537 --> 09:55.538
Okay, I get it.
He's a bad guy.

09:55.622 --> 09:56.756
Sign here.

09:56.824 --> 09:58.991
In the words of khan noonn singh

09:59.042 --> 10:02.411
in the immortal wrath of Khan,
"he tasks me.

10:02.496 --> 10:05.364
He tasks me and I shall have him."

10:05.415 --> 10:07.333
No doubt, sign here.

10:07.384 --> 10:10.036
From hell's heart,
I stab at thee."

10:12.723 --> 10:15.508
All right, Raj, looks
like you're teamed up

10:15.559 --> 10:18.094
with "die, Wil Wheaton, die."

10:23.682 --> 10:26.300
So, tell me more about the
future mother of my children.

10:27.485 --> 10:29.069
She's adorable, Howard.

10:29.137 --> 10:30.387
I think you'll like her.

10:30.455 --> 10:31.605
Great.

10:31.656 --> 10:33.490
So what did you tell her about me?

10:33.575 --> 10:34.942
Did you mention the body fat?

10:35.010 --> 10:38.329
No, I thought that would be
a nice surprise for her.

10:38.413 --> 10:41.148
Good, good.

10:43.418 --> 10:46.120
I just told her you're
an aerospace engineer,

10:46.171 --> 10:47.588
you speak five languages...

10:47.655 --> 10:49.289
six if you count Klingon.

10:49.341 --> 10:52.076
Girls don't count Klingon, Howard.

10:52.143 --> 10:52.843
Right?

10:52.927 --> 10:53.961
Right.

10:55.663 --> 10:56.997
Oh. And I told her you have

10:57.048 --> 10:58.265
an unhealthy attachment to your mother.

10:58.332 --> 10:59.933
What?

11:00.001 --> 11:01.385
I'm kidding.

11:02.854 --> 11:05.338
Another delightful surprise for her.

11:10.511 --> 11:12.363
Sheldon, it's your play.

11:12.430 --> 11:14.515
Sheldon.

11:16.017 --> 11:18.852
My enchanted troll bludgeons
your screaming harpy

11:18.903 --> 11:20.371
with a cursed mace. Game.

11:21.956 --> 11:23.073
Sorry, boys.

11:23.158 --> 11:25.876
Say hi to your mother
when she picks you up.

11:25.960 --> 11:28.545
Or I could just tell her later tonight!

11:30.465 --> 11:32.466
We pawned them, dude! Up top!

11:32.533 --> 11:34.051
Look at him.

11:34.135 --> 11:38.505
Wil Wheaton, my old friend.

11:38.556 --> 11:40.974
I have chased you 'round
the moons of Nibia

11:41.042 --> 11:45.345
and 'round the Antares maelstrom
and 'round perdition's flames!

11:45.413 --> 11:47.681
You know,
you keep quoting Wrath of Khan,

11:47.749 --> 11:48.966
but he was in next generation.

11:49.033 --> 11:50.901
It's a totally different
set of characters.

11:50.985 --> 11:53.437
Silence!

11:53.521 --> 11:56.407
How much longer must
I wait for my revenge?

11:56.491 --> 11:58.375
Well, if Wil Wheaton
and Stuart win their match

11:58.443 --> 12:01.028
and we beat lonely Larry
and captain sweatpants

12:01.079 --> 12:02.246
in the next round,

12:02.330 --> 12:04.231
we'll face off for the championship.

12:04.282 --> 12:07.567
So, my path to satisfaction is blocked

12:07.619 --> 12:10.971
by lonely Larry and captain sweatpants.

12:11.039 --> 12:13.307
Very well.

12:13.374 --> 12:15.893
They must be destroyed.

12:15.960 --> 12:18.045
Dude, you have to stop
talking like that.

12:18.096 --> 12:19.129
It's really lame.

12:19.214 --> 12:21.648
Silence!

12:25.887 --> 12:29.106
So, Penny tells me you're
working as a waitress

12:29.190 --> 12:31.024
to put yourself through grad school.

12:31.092 --> 12:33.143
That's pretty great.
What are you studying?

12:33.228 --> 12:34.244
Microbiology.

12:34.312 --> 12:39.116
Oh, cool.
So you could study me.

12:39.200 --> 12:41.118
I don't understand.

12:41.202 --> 12:45.772
Microbiology is the study
of tiny living things.

12:45.824 --> 12:48.959
I know, I'm studying it.

12:48.960 --> 12:55.916
And I said you could study me
'cause I'm a tiny living thing.

12:55.967 --> 12:58.618
It's a joke.

12:58.670 --> 13:00.671
Are you sure?

13:05.310 --> 13:06.426
Do you like science-fiction?

13:06.478 --> 13:07.427
No.

13:07.479 --> 13:08.595
Role-playing games?

13:08.646 --> 13:11.598
Like in the bedroom or
like Dungeons and Dragons?

13:11.649 --> 13:13.133
Either.

13:13.184 --> 13:13.984
No.

13:15.520 --> 13:18.822
Gonna be a long night.

13:18.940 --> 13:20.524
Well, it's your fault.

13:20.608 --> 13:24.261
I had to ask.
You didn't have to say yes.

13:24.329 --> 13:26.497
You like magic?

13:26.581 --> 13:27.498
Not really.

13:27.582 --> 13:29.149
Okay.

13:36.524 --> 13:41.845
I play my endless serpent.
Raj will play ecstatic frenzy,

13:41.930 --> 13:43.814
which means Larry will have
to play chaos overlord.

13:43.882 --> 13:45.883
Then captain sweatpants,
molten river.

13:45.967 --> 13:49.169
I play nightshade dryad.
Game, set and match.

13:52.257 --> 13:55.692
Now fetch me Wil Wheaton!

13:57.178 --> 14:02.199
Bot-tash bir jab-loo-di
rekh kkhakkh-o ny!

14:02.283 --> 14:04.818
Did that guy just say

14:04.886 --> 14:07.955
"revenge is a dish best
served cold" in Klingon?

14:08.022 --> 14:10.307
I believe so.

14:10.375 --> 14:13.911
What is wrong with him?

14:13.995 --> 14:16.797
Everyone has a different theory.

14:20.635 --> 14:22.836
How about computers?

14:22.904 --> 14:24.171
Do you like computers?

14:24.222 --> 14:27.057
I use them.
I don't like them.

14:27.058 --> 14:29.709
Okay...

14:29.761 --> 14:32.913
Puppies?
Where do you stand on puppies?

14:33.014 --> 14:36.233
A puppy once bit my face.

14:36.317 --> 14:37.851
Of course it did.

14:37.919 --> 14:40.354
How about that?
Einstein was wrong.

14:40.405 --> 14:41.188
What?

14:41.239 --> 14:42.439
Approaching the speed of light

14:42.523 --> 14:43.523
doesn't slow down time.

14:43.575 --> 14:44.775
Approaching them does.

14:48.229 --> 14:49.947
Excuse me.

14:50.031 --> 14:51.782
Oh, damn. It's my mother.

14:51.849 --> 14:53.066
Are you going to answer it?

14:53.117 --> 14:54.101
I'm torn.

14:54.168 --> 14:56.236
She might be dying, and,
you know,

14:56.304 --> 14:57.570
I wouldn't want to miss that.

14:57.622 --> 14:59.890
On the other hand,

14:59.958 --> 15:05.112
if I let it go to voicemail,
I could play it over and over.

15:05.179 --> 15:09.466
I know how you feel.
My mother makes me crazy.

15:09.550 --> 15:12.219
Not as crazy as my mother makes me.

15:12.270 --> 15:13.420
Oh, yeah?

15:13.471 --> 15:15.105
Does your mother call
you every day at work

15:15.106 --> 15:16.607
to see if you've had a healthy lunch?

15:16.691 --> 15:18.542
My mother calls me at work

15:18.610 --> 15:21.261
to see if I had a
healthy bowel movement.

15:25.116 --> 15:26.783
Okay, well, does she lay out

15:26.868 --> 15:28.702
your clothes for you in the morning

15:28.769 --> 15:29.987
like you're nine years old?

15:30.054 --> 15:32.055
You live with your mother?

15:32.123 --> 15:34.291
No. That's the sad part.

15:35.410 --> 15:36.376
Ooh, rough.

15:36.444 --> 15:37.744
Okay, check this out.

15:37.795 --> 15:39.913
My mother made me wear
rubber gloves to kindergarten

15:39.964 --> 15:43.800
so I wouldn't pick up a disease
from the other children.

15:43.885 --> 15:45.168
That's nothing.

15:45.253 --> 15:46.436
I couldn't ride a bicycle

15:46.504 --> 15:48.639
'cause my mother was
afraid I'd hit a bump

15:48.706 --> 15:49.806
and lose my virginity.

15:49.891 --> 15:52.092
Oh, wow.

15:52.143 --> 15:53.176
You didn't, did you?

15:53.261 --> 15:54.895
Not on a bicycle.

15:54.962 --> 15:56.847
In a camry.

15:56.914 --> 15:57.981
Oh!

15:59.484 --> 16:00.917
Corolla!

16:02.337 --> 16:04.021
More wine?
I'd love some.

16:04.105 --> 16:05.939
Listen, you have to come

16:05.990 --> 16:07.691
to shabbat dinner
at my house sometime.

16:07.775 --> 16:08.909
Why?

16:08.976 --> 16:10.544
A catholic girl like you

16:10.611 --> 16:11.945
wearing a big cross like that

16:11.996 --> 16:14.581
might just give my mother
the big brain aneurysm

16:14.648 --> 16:15.815
I've been hoping for.

16:17.952 --> 16:20.704
Okay, but only if you come

16:20.788 --> 16:23.173
to Sunday dinner at my
house wearing a yarmulke.

16:23.174 --> 16:24.524
It's a date.

16:25.843 --> 16:28.078
Am I a matchmaker or what?

16:34.685 --> 16:36.386
Lava serpent.

16:36.470 --> 16:40.356
Nest of snakes.

16:40.441 --> 16:41.391
Underworld guardian.

16:41.475 --> 16:43.276
Underworld guardian.

16:44.144 --> 16:46.396
We skirmish to the death.

16:51.986 --> 16:53.019
Invisibility spell.

16:53.070 --> 16:54.337
Luminescence spell.

16:54.405 --> 16:55.488
Water nymph.

16:55.539 --> 16:56.506
Fire demon.

16:56.574 --> 16:57.857
Two-headed tiger.

16:57.908 --> 16:59.709
Three-headed lion.

16:59.793 --> 17:01.578
Sulphur.

17:01.662 --> 17:02.862
Brimstone.

17:04.214 --> 17:06.382
Problem, Wil Wheaton?

17:08.919 --> 17:09.919
Hang on.

17:10.003 --> 17:12.338
You're holding two moderate spell cards,

17:12.388 --> 17:14.373
a small rock and a potion of Zancor,

17:14.374 --> 17:15.875
which will be about as much help

17:15.925 --> 17:17.827
as an air conditioner
on the ice planet Hoth.

17:17.895 --> 17:20.096
Your only move is to play the potion,

17:20.180 --> 17:22.048
lose the skirmish,

17:22.098 --> 17:23.916
and two moves later,
the game.

17:23.983 --> 17:26.736
I think he's got me.

17:26.819 --> 17:31.608
The year was 1995.

17:31.692 --> 17:34.310
The place: Jackson, Mississippi.

17:34.345 --> 17:37.363
Having spent ten hours on a bus,

17:37.414 --> 17:39.332
during which I had to twice violate

17:39.399 --> 17:42.201
my personal rule
against relieving myself

17:42.253 --> 17:43.720
on board a moving vehicle...

17:45.022 --> 17:46.172
I finally arrived

17:46.239 --> 17:48.958
at the fourth annual
Dixie-Trek convention

17:49.043 --> 17:53.463
only to find that my idol
Wil Wheaton decided he had

17:53.547 --> 17:57.083
better things to do than to show
up and sign my action figure.

18:01.105 --> 18:02.422
What?

18:04.257 --> 18:09.276
You betrayed me, Wil Wheaton.
Now I have my revenge.

18:10.814 --> 18:15.618
You went to the '95 Dixie-Trek?

18:16.737 --> 18:20.123
Oh, dude,
my grandmother had just died,

18:20.207 --> 18:22.609
and I had to go to her funeral.

18:25.045 --> 18:27.480
Your mee-maw died?

18:29.466 --> 18:30.683
That's terrible.

18:30.751 --> 18:32.669
Yeah, it was.

18:32.753 --> 18:36.172
But I'm really sorry
that I disappointed you.

18:36.256 --> 18:39.092
No, no, I understand.

18:39.143 --> 18:40.727
Anything happened to my mee-maw,

18:40.794 --> 18:42.795
I'd be one inconsolable moon pie.

18:44.331 --> 18:46.132
I should clarify that statement

18:46.183 --> 18:49.185
by explaining that she
calls me "moon pie."

18:49.253 --> 18:51.804
It's special relationship,
isn't it,

18:51.855 --> 18:53.606
between a boy and his grandmother?

18:53.657 --> 18:55.174
Oh, yes.

18:55.242 --> 18:58.144
Okay, great, everybody
loves their grandmas!

18:58.195 --> 19:00.930
Now, come on, Sheldon,
finish him off!

19:00.998 --> 19:02.615
It's okay, Sheldon.

19:02.666 --> 19:03.750
I let you down.

19:03.817 --> 19:05.484
I deserve it.

19:05.536 --> 19:07.120
Potion of Zancor.

19:09.456 --> 19:12.675
What are you waiting for?!

19:12.760 --> 19:14.427
Kill Wil Wheaton!

19:14.461 --> 19:16.779
From hell's heart,
stab at him!

19:18.649 --> 19:21.100
I can't.

19:21.168 --> 19:23.469
Sure you can. Do it! Do it!

19:24.138 --> 19:26.005
No.

19:26.056 --> 19:28.340
I came here to defeat Wil Wheaton,

19:28.442 --> 19:31.060
the man who destroyed my dreams.

19:31.145 --> 19:36.866
But I can't defeat Wil Wheaton,
the man who loved is mee-maw.

19:39.403 --> 19:41.654
Enchanted bunny.

19:41.705 --> 19:46.042
No! Not enchanted bunny!

19:46.126 --> 19:49.495
I call my mee-maw "nana."

19:50.798 --> 19:52.799
And she's going be very happy

19:52.866 --> 19:56.135
to hear that my small rock
kills your enchanted bunny.

19:57.254 --> 20:00.890
Game over, moon pie.

20:04.094 --> 20:05.711
I... I... I don't understand.

20:05.763 --> 20:07.980
Your grandmother's alive?

20:08.048 --> 20:09.649
Oh, you catch on quick.

20:09.716 --> 20:13.069
Come on, Stewie,
let's get our prize money.

20:16.190 --> 20:17.490
That was fun.

20:25.565 --> 20:27.567
Wheaton!

20:27.634 --> 20:31.137
Wheaton! Wheaton!

20:31.205 --> 20:37.122
