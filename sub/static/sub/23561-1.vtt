WEBVTT

02:16.176 --> 02:19.137
- Professor Ragheeb.
- Send him in, will you?

02:21.306 --> 02:23.891
Good afternoon. Mr. Saeed?

02:24.935 --> 02:29.438
Mr. Saeed's away, I'm afraid.
My name's Sloane.

02:31.191 --> 02:33.067
Away? Why is he away?

02:33.569 --> 02:35.570
Flu, Professor.

02:35.946 --> 02:41.576
Medical men aren't immune. He asked me
to look after his appointments.

02:42.703 --> 02:47.707
I'm only checking your glasses. You look
as though I want to drill your teeth.

02:47.958 --> 02:49.959
Do sit down, Professor.

02:51.712 --> 02:56.674
Ragheeb. That doesn't sound English.
Are you English, Professor Ragheeb?

02:56.842 --> 03:00.344
- Why do you ask?
- Oh, small talk, merely small talk.

03:00.596 --> 03:03.347
The weather's too dull
and politics too explosive.

03:04.474 --> 03:06.559
I certainly didn't mean to pry.

03:06.727 --> 03:10.229
- May I see your glasses?
- I can't see anything without them.

03:12.733 --> 03:15.735
- Yes. Yes, indeed.
- Please.

03:19.573 --> 03:23.743
- Have you been exposed to flu recently?
- Does that weaken the eyes?

03:23.952 --> 03:25.870
No, merely the eye doctors.

03:26.121 --> 03:30.082
There's so much close personal contact
in our line, we can't be too careful.

03:31.627 --> 03:33.502
Now...

03:37.883 --> 03:40.384
let's just try these.

03:40.594 --> 03:42.470
There.

03:45.891 --> 03:50.645
- Read those letters in the mirror.
- "A."

03:50.896 --> 03:53.522
"N, D."

03:54.900 --> 03:58.402
"A, O, H, T."

03:59.488 --> 04:02.281
Not bad. Now the other eye.

04:02.908 --> 04:06.410
"H, C, U."

04:07.371 --> 04:11.165
"D, H, L, E."

04:11.416 --> 04:15.503
- "M." No. "N."
- Jolly good.

04:15.671 --> 04:19.714
Look up at me, Professor.
I want to put some drops in your eyes.

04:19.882 --> 04:21.759
- Why?
- To dilate the pupil.

04:26.723 --> 04:30.393
It's quite all right, Professor.
You won't feel anything.

04:44.116 --> 04:47.785
- There. That didn't hurt, did it?
- No, it was...

05:19.901 --> 05:21.944
Here on the final slide

05:22.154 --> 05:25.823
is an example of a more cursive form
of hieroglyphs,

05:26.033 --> 05:29.535
probably from the reign
of the great Pharaoh Ramses ll.

05:29.703 --> 05:34.040
Now we can still recognize
what many of the signs represent.

05:34.207 --> 05:37.835
Here, for example,
is the word for "heart",

05:38.086 --> 05:40.713
written simply with
the picture of the heart.

05:40.922 --> 05:45.051
But here, above the monster Amensit,

05:45.218 --> 05:48.929
who, as you can see, is part crocodile,
part lion and part hippo,

05:49.181 --> 05:52.433
and who waits to devour
the heart of the dead man

05:52.684 --> 05:54.477
is the glyph for a house.

05:54.686 --> 05:58.981
Below it is a mouth.
These signs have phonetic value only.

05:59.191 --> 06:01.609
They are followed
by a drawing of a pair of legs,

06:01.860 --> 06:04.570
which, in this case,
has no phonetic value.

06:04.738 --> 06:09.617
As an ideogram, it does give us
the clue to the meaning of the word

06:09.868 --> 06:11.744
"to go forth".

06:13.622 --> 06:15.331
Sex.

06:16.625 --> 06:20.628
I thought there must be some way of
attracting your attention, Mr. Fanshaw.

06:20.962 --> 06:23.881
I seem to have been talking
in your sleep.

06:25.884 --> 06:31.138
That will be all for today.
Professor Ragheeb will be back tomorrow.

06:31.390 --> 06:33.349
Good morning.

06:33.517 --> 06:35.518
May I have a word, Professor Pollock?

06:35.769 --> 06:38.604
If it's about that
outstanding bill at the bookstore,

06:38.772 --> 06:40.856
there's a simple explanation: poverty.

06:41.108 --> 06:46.153
- No, it's nothing like that.
- In that case, how do you do?

06:47.280 --> 06:50.282
My name is Sloane.
Major Sylvester Pennington Sloane

06:50.492 --> 06:53.369
of Her Majesty's
42nd Highland Fusiliers, retired.

06:53.537 --> 06:55.538
- Marvelous.
- Yes, quite.

06:55.747 --> 06:59.166
I'm private secretary to Mr. Nejim
Beshraavi of the shipping lines.

06:59.418 --> 07:02.753
- The Nejim Beshraavi.
- I didn't think there could be two.

07:03.004 --> 07:05.297
Mr. Beshraavi would like to see you
in London,

07:05.549 --> 07:08.175
so if you'll follow me, please,
the car is waiting.

07:08.385 --> 07:11.804
Mr. Sloane, this is Wednesday.
Shall I tell you about my Wednesdays?

07:12.055 --> 07:15.182
Right now: a healthyjog
and a couple of tutorials,

07:15.434 --> 07:18.561
an indescribable lunch
with the faculty at 12:45...

07:18.812 --> 07:21.313
Mr. Beshraavi
will pay you well for your time.

07:21.523 --> 07:24.567
And I could use it,
I don't mind telling you.

07:24.818 --> 07:27.570
But, as I said, not on Wednesdays.

07:27.821 --> 07:29.947
Good morning, Mr. Sloane.

08:04.441 --> 08:08.235
You people really can't take no
for an answer, can you?

08:08.487 --> 08:11.113
What do you think you're doing?

08:11.364 --> 08:13.365
Let me go!

08:17.996 --> 08:20.748
Good Lord, a-aren't you...

08:20.999 --> 08:25.002
Mr. Pollock, may I present
His Excellency, Mr. Hassan Jena?

08:27.881 --> 08:32.717
- Well... Mr. Prime Minister.
- Good morning, Mr. Pollock.

08:32.969 --> 08:36.054
I am Mr. Jena's Ambassador
to Great Britain, Mohammed Lufti.

08:36.306 --> 08:37.556
Mr. Ambassador.

08:37.807 --> 08:41.809
Please forgive this unorthodox method
of making your acquaintance.

08:42.020 --> 08:43.687
Please, don't mention it.

08:43.938 --> 08:48.150
There's nothing like a kidnapping now
and then to keep the circulation going.

08:49.444 --> 08:53.072
The fact is that
there are very few men on this Earth

08:53.281 --> 08:55.199
whom I admire more than you.

08:55.450 --> 08:57.284
You're a very great man.

08:57.452 --> 09:01.455
No man is greater than the people he
serves. Your respect must be for them.

09:01.706 --> 09:05.918
Yes, sir. l...
l didn't know that you were in England.

09:06.086 --> 09:10.089
You are quite right. I am not.
You have not seen me.

09:10.340 --> 09:14.343
The first favor I would ask of you
is to help keep my visit here a secret.

09:14.594 --> 09:17.972
Of course, sir. And... And the second?

09:18.223 --> 09:21.225
You know a fellow countryman of mine,
Mr. Nejim Beshraavi.

09:21.476 --> 09:22.851
The Nejim Beshraavi.

09:23.103 --> 09:25.729
Yes, our richest
and most powerful citizen.

09:25.981 --> 09:27.856
We have every reason to believe

09:28.066 --> 09:30.985
he intends approaching you
with a business proposition.

09:31.236 --> 09:34.071
He already has, sir,
but I turned him down.

09:34.322 --> 09:35.990
- Oh, dear.
- Wrong?

09:36.241 --> 09:41.078
Your association with him could have
been valuable to the cause of freedom.

09:41.329 --> 09:42.580
How?

09:42.747 --> 09:45.958
All we know is that Beshraavi
is opposed to our programmes

09:46.126 --> 09:50.004
and plans some violent exercise
of that opposition in the near future.

09:50.255 --> 09:53.507
We have to find out
what he intends doing and when.

09:53.717 --> 09:56.385
You want me to re-establish contact,

09:56.595 --> 09:58.887
accept his offer
and see what I can find out?

09:59.097 --> 10:01.015
We want that very much.

10:01.266 --> 10:06.145
But you must not accept
until you know all the possibilities.

10:06.396 --> 10:10.149
The assignment carries
a certain amount of risk.

10:10.400 --> 10:13.736
Is that a statesmanlike way
of saying that I could get killed?

10:13.903 --> 10:17.615
Mr. Beshraavi respects
no one's life but his own.

10:17.782 --> 10:21.910
If you wish, I will stop the car and let
you out with nothing further being said.

10:22.120 --> 10:25.873
For generations,
the Pollocks have devoted themselves

10:26.124 --> 10:28.542
to uncovering the past.

10:28.793 --> 10:31.545
I think it's probably
about time that a Pollock

10:31.796 --> 10:34.048
involved himself in the future
for a change.

10:34.299 --> 10:38.385
As soon as you have any information,
you will contact Mr. Jena in London.

10:39.554 --> 10:42.431
Ambassador-2779.

10:42.682 --> 10:45.142
Words cannot express my gratitude.

10:55.945 --> 10:59.448
Mr. Pollock, very good of you
to reconsider my proposal.

10:59.699 --> 11:03.952
I always try my best to cooperate
with the very rich, Mr. Beshraavi.

11:04.204 --> 11:06.580
Do sit down.

11:06.831 --> 11:10.209
You mustn't mind Hassan, Mr. Pollock.

11:10.460 --> 11:13.837
- Hassan?
- He's a peregrine falcon.

11:14.047 --> 11:17.299
I've named him Hassan Jena
after our beloved prime minister.

11:17.467 --> 11:19.843
They share so many sterling qualities.

11:20.095 --> 11:25.057
A sharp eye, a fierce dedication,
and very sharp claws.

11:25.225 --> 11:29.978
Hassan won't harm you, Mr. Pollock, if
you don't separate him from his master.

11:30.188 --> 11:32.564
He is excessively loyal.

11:34.359 --> 11:36.944
You keep him well fed, I trust.

11:37.112 --> 11:39.988
Of course. Nobody's that loyal.

11:41.241 --> 11:43.450
I won't presume upon your time,
Professor.

11:43.702 --> 11:46.745
I know how valuable it must be.

11:46.996 --> 11:49.498
What do you make of that?

11:51.501 --> 11:53.627
It's a copy of a Hittite inscription.

11:53.878 --> 11:56.004
Second millennium BC, I would guess.

11:56.214 --> 11:58.882
Take a date, Mr. Pollock,
as a gesture of friendship.

11:59.134 --> 12:01.593
I'm a very Arabian Arab, I'm afraid.

12:04.139 --> 12:05.973
Friends?

12:06.141 --> 12:10.018
Flesh, Mr. Pollock.
Hassan eats only flesh.

12:10.270 --> 12:13.897
- I thought he looked at it wistfully.
- It must have been your fingers.

12:15.150 --> 12:18.235
I want to know
what that inscription means.

12:18.486 --> 12:21.029
I want to know that very much.

12:21.239 --> 12:23.282
May I ask an indelicate question?

12:23.533 --> 12:25.784
- How much?
- $25,000.

12:27.662 --> 12:30.038
Very well. I won't quibble, $30,000.

12:30.290 --> 12:32.875
You go right ahead and quibble.

12:33.042 --> 12:35.377
How did you happen to get hold of it?

12:35.628 --> 12:38.630
Let us say,
I happened upon it by chance.

12:40.925 --> 12:45.429
Well, may the...
gods continue to smile on you.

12:45.680 --> 12:48.265
Thank you, Professor.
I value your good wishes.

12:48.516 --> 12:50.893
But I won't keep you
from your work any longer.

12:51.144 --> 12:53.937
If you haven't finished
by 8:00 tonight, you'll be...

12:54.189 --> 12:56.190
- Tonight?
- That is correct.

12:56.441 --> 13:00.569
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt your threat.

13:00.779 --> 13:04.698
- If I'm not finished by 8:00...
- Then you'll be my guest for dinner.

13:06.326 --> 13:08.410
I see.

13:09.454 --> 13:11.830
If I should happen
to run just a smidge over?

13:12.040 --> 13:16.335
You'll find this house a comfortable
place to work in, Mr. Pollock,

13:16.586 --> 13:18.337
however long it takes you.

13:42.487 --> 13:45.739
- Hello.
- Hello.

13:49.118 --> 13:51.870
Hello.

13:52.121 --> 13:54.373
Hello, hello, hello.

13:56.125 --> 13:58.377
What are you doing?

13:58.586 --> 14:02.589
Oh, these English crosswords
are devilish, don't you think?

14:02.757 --> 14:06.009
- You're an American.
- Yes, sir. Indeedy-do, ma'am.

14:06.261 --> 14:08.011
I don't meet many Americans.

14:08.263 --> 14:12.099
Actually, I don't meet many people
who are dressed like that either.

14:13.518 --> 14:15.394
Do you like it?

14:17.480 --> 14:21.275
Would you do me up, please?

14:28.783 --> 14:31.285
- Oh.
- Can you manage?

14:31.536 --> 14:36.290
Well, l...
I always tremble when I'm happy.

14:36.541 --> 14:41.670
- I take it you're a houseguest here.
- Why do you take that?

14:41.880 --> 14:45.632
One doesn't usually arrive for high tea
dressed in a nighty.

14:45.884 --> 14:49.636
One also isn't a houseguest
in one's own house.

14:49.888 --> 14:54.433
Oh, it's your house. I got the
impression it was Mr. Beshraavi's house.

14:55.560 --> 14:58.645
Nejim gives that impression
with everything he borrows,

14:58.897 --> 15:03.525
but I assure you it is my house,
and he's the guest.

15:03.693 --> 15:05.777
Would you care to stay for dinner?

15:07.572 --> 15:10.574
I'm afraid that our street urchin
has already invited me.

15:10.825 --> 15:12.951
How bothersome.

15:14.454 --> 15:17.539
You are working on the cipher,
aren't you?

15:17.707 --> 15:21.335
Let's not talk about work.
Let's talk about you.

15:21.586 --> 15:24.212
Listen,
I don't know what Nejim has told you...

15:25.715 --> 15:28.967
There you are, Yasmin.
I hardly expected to find you here.

15:29.177 --> 15:31.970
- In her own house?
- In the library.

15:32.221 --> 15:36.350
Yasmin has so many talents,
she has practically no time for reading.

15:36.601 --> 15:40.729
I'm sorry to tell you this, my dear, but
Mr. Pollock is as poor as a church mouse.

15:40.980 --> 15:45.192
- Will you come and change for dinner?
- Excuse me.

15:45.443 --> 15:48.612
Those slippers are
absolutely beautiful, my darling.

15:48.821 --> 15:51.448
- Are you wearing them for my benefit?
- Of course.

15:51.616 --> 15:55.077
Mr. Pollock does not have
your exotic refinements.

15:55.244 --> 15:58.497
- He prefers nighties.
- She said it, I didn't.

15:58.748 --> 16:04.127
Mr. Pollock, some Bedouins are
in the habit of saying to their guests,

16:04.379 --> 16:06.380
"All that I possess is yours".

16:06.631 --> 16:09.132
I am not one of them.

16:12.136 --> 16:14.721
Delicious, Beshraavi. What is it, squab?

16:14.889 --> 16:19.476
- Lark.
- Lark? Good heavens.

16:19.644 --> 16:22.354
They've been soaked in honey
for eight days.

16:22.522 --> 16:26.400
What about you, Mr. Pollock?
Or is the prospect too exotic?

16:26.609 --> 16:29.653
I trust you'll notify my next of kin.

16:31.906 --> 16:34.366
Go on, Mr. Pollock. Courage.

16:34.617 --> 16:36.910
Oh, I am sorry.

16:37.495 --> 16:40.372
That's all right.
I've always had a sweet tooth.

16:42.166 --> 16:46.503
I hate being clumsy. I despise it.

16:46.671 --> 16:48.755
But you never are, my dear.

16:48.923 --> 16:51.633
This is the first time
I've seen you be so gauche.

16:59.392 --> 17:02.561
You've dropped something, Mr. Pollock.

17:04.439 --> 17:08.608
Well... so I have at that.

17:09.527 --> 17:11.403
What do you suppose it is?

17:13.239 --> 17:17.409
It looks like a little piece
of folded paper, doesn't it?

17:19.244 --> 17:21.872
Let's see if there's
anything written on it.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.540
Was that you? I'm terribly sorry.

17:24.751 --> 17:27.752
Let's see if there's
anything written on it.

17:30.298 --> 17:32.924
There is something written on it.

17:33.134 --> 17:36.678
Don't keep it a secret. What is it?

17:37.889 --> 17:40.557
It's a prescription.

17:40.808 --> 17:42.809
I suffer from indigestion.

17:43.061 --> 17:46.063
All those dry books I try to digest.

17:46.814 --> 17:50.650
Perhaps we can have it made up
at the chemistjust around the corner.

17:50.818 --> 17:53.695
- Don't bother.
- No bother. One of the servants...

17:53.905 --> 17:56.656
It would be for them.
It's absolutely unnecessary.

17:56.824 --> 18:00.035
I think I'd better be
getting back to work.

18:00.286 --> 18:07.209
The dinner was delicious,
and... that was quite a lark.

18:09.670 --> 18:11.546
Well...

18:15.593 --> 18:18.553
He certainly was strange,
even for an American.

18:20.848 --> 18:24.476
I'm sure you and Mr. Beauchamp
have business to discuss,

18:24.685 --> 18:28.480
so I'll develop a splitting headache
before your talk gives me one.

18:28.731 --> 18:31.942
- Good night, Mr. Beauchamp.
- Good night, Miss Azir.

18:32.110 --> 18:34.820
When are you going to let me
show you around my bank?

18:34.987 --> 18:37.948
The moment I find myself
in need of refinancing.

18:38.991 --> 18:40.867
You, I'll see later, no doubt.

18:43.871 --> 18:47.374
Beauchamp, you've been oozing
good fellowship all evening.

18:47.583 --> 18:49.960
When a banker oozes,
someone's in trouble.

18:50.211 --> 18:52.087
Let us have your bad news.

18:54.715 --> 18:57.634
I was too discreet to mention it
in front of your guests,

18:57.885 --> 19:01.263
but do you know what they've been saying
about you on the exchange?

19:01.514 --> 19:03.974
Your brokers gossip like Arab women
at the well.

19:04.142 --> 19:07.602
They say when Prime Minister Jena
arrives the day after tomorrow,

19:07.854 --> 19:09.896
he will sign the treaty.

19:10.148 --> 19:13.150
They say the treaty specifies
Anglo-American finance

19:13.401 --> 19:17.654
in return for a promise your country
uses English and American tankers.

19:21.784 --> 19:24.661
They say your ships
will be laid up for good.

19:24.912 --> 19:27.622
- Do they?
- If they go on saying that, old boy,

19:27.790 --> 19:30.125
in a week your shares will be down
ten points.

19:30.293 --> 19:33.420
Don't worry. There will be
no treaty signed, old boy.

19:33.671 --> 19:38.884
I happen to have in my employ
a most dependable soothsayer.

20:48.704 --> 20:51.498
Psst. In here.

20:57.129 --> 21:00.632
Now then, Miss Azir, I wonder
if you'd tell me what this is all about.

21:00.883 --> 21:05.095
Call me Yasmin.
At least while you're in my bathroom.

21:06.764 --> 21:11.393
Now then, Yasmin, I wonder if
you would tell me what is going on?

21:11.644 --> 21:14.396
Professor Ragheeb
didn't fall out of any window.

21:14.605 --> 21:17.274
They murdered him!

21:17.483 --> 21:19.359
Beshraavi?

21:19.527 --> 21:21.778
I doubt if it was him personally.

21:22.029 --> 21:25.532
- How do you know?
- What difference does it make?

21:25.783 --> 21:29.411
They killed him, and they'll kill
you too. You'd better keep out of this.

21:31.372 --> 21:34.416
Me? Why should Beshraavi
have anything against me?

21:34.667 --> 21:37.043
He needs me to decipher the inscription.

21:37.295 --> 21:40.922
- And when you've done it?
- Good point.

21:41.173 --> 21:44.926
The message is too important for
anyone he doesn't own to know about it.

21:45.177 --> 21:47.178
What about you?

21:50.266 --> 21:53.018
Lock, stock and barrel?

21:56.272 --> 21:58.189
This is ridiculous.

21:58.441 --> 22:01.776
We're in England, a civilized country,
in the middle of London.

22:01.944 --> 22:04.946
Over there is Regent's Park.
There's the zoo.

22:05.197 --> 22:09.451
Over in Buckingham Palace,
the Queen is probably playing Scrabble.

22:09.660 --> 22:11.536
He can't own anyone here.

22:11.704 --> 22:14.581
Everyone has his price.

22:14.790 --> 22:16.833
How much, Mr. Pollock?

22:18.336 --> 22:20.211
$30,000.

22:22.798 --> 22:24.841
I did not settle so cheaply.

22:26.969 --> 22:29.679
Why should you care what happens to me?

22:29.847 --> 22:32.432
I care about all things that live,
Professor.

22:32.683 --> 22:36.603
$30,000 in exchange for your old age
is a very bad bargain.

22:36.812 --> 22:38.855
Do you know...

22:41.484 --> 22:44.986
- Who is it?
- Yasmin, why have you locked the door?

22:48.741 --> 22:51.826
Yasmin? Can you hear me?

22:51.994 --> 22:54.079
I was about to take a shower, darling.

22:54.330 --> 22:58.124
You know how I despise locked doors.

22:58.376 --> 23:00.585
Forgive me, Nejim.

23:03.005 --> 23:06.466
People who lock doors
generally have things to hide.

23:06.634 --> 23:08.968
Would you care to search me?

23:09.220 --> 23:11.763
Would I find your thoughts?

23:13.849 --> 23:15.642
Well?

23:15.893 --> 23:19.521
Darling, don't ask me
to speak with my mouth full.

23:19.772 --> 23:21.898
You know, at dinner, just for a moment,

23:22.149 --> 23:26.236
I thought you deliberately knocked over
the plate and gave a note to Mr. Pollock.

23:27.029 --> 23:29.614
Imagine. That really is extraordinary.

23:29.865 --> 23:33.910
- Jealous? You?
- I'm jealous of your thoughts, Yasmin.

23:34.120 --> 23:38.498
I'm jealous of everything I can't see
or hear. Your shower's still running.

23:40.418 --> 23:44.170
- I'll turn it off.
- No, take your shower.

23:44.422 --> 23:47.424
Maybe I won't tonight. I'm so sleepy.

23:47.675 --> 23:51.302
In that case, please do.
I want you wide awake.

24:08.821 --> 24:11.781
There now. Wasn't I right?
Isn't that refreshing?

24:12.032 --> 24:14.075
You might say that.

24:14.285 --> 24:18.455
- You feel wide awake now?
- Yes... but I wish I weren't.

24:18.706 --> 24:22.333
You sound very tense, my love.
Turn around.

24:22.585 --> 24:24.544
Let the water run down your back.

24:24.712 --> 24:28.173
- It soothes the nerves.
- I don't think it would.

24:31.343 --> 24:33.428
- Nejim?
- Yes?

24:33.596 --> 24:36.306
Why is Mr. Pollock
working on that inscription?

24:36.474 --> 24:38.975
It's a business matter.
It would only bore you.

24:41.604 --> 24:46.858
- What was that?
- I dropped the soap.

24:47.109 --> 24:51.237
- Should I pick it up?
- Oh, no, no, I... I'll manage.

24:55.075 --> 24:56.326
Somehow.

24:59.955 --> 25:04.083
- Have you got it?
- Yes, darling. it's all right.

25:05.377 --> 25:09.839
Extraordinary sensation. Perhaps
it was the way he looked at you.

25:10.090 --> 25:11.966
- Who?
- Pollock.

25:12.218 --> 25:15.887
Darling, if you start getting jealous
over everyone who looks at me,

25:16.138 --> 25:18.848
it will do terrible things
to your blood pressure.

25:19.016 --> 25:22.644
I don't think you have to worry
about college professors.

25:22.853 --> 25:25.855
- Why not?
- They're only interested in work.

25:26.106 --> 25:31.653
They're the most dangerous kind,
my love. They're such expert peekers.

25:31.904 --> 25:37.116
Don't worry. if I were standing
stark naked in front of Mr. Pollock,

25:37.368 --> 25:39.244
he'd probably yawn.

25:40.996 --> 25:43.289
I think it's time I dried you.

25:51.674 --> 25:53.633
Excuse me, Yasmin. The phone.

25:58.514 --> 26:00.682
- Yes?
- Mr. Beshraavi.

26:00.933 --> 26:02.642
Yes, what is it, Sloane?

26:02.810 --> 26:04.686
I don't know where Mr. Pollock is, sir.

26:04.937 --> 26:07.939
- Isn't he in the library?
- I don't think so, sir.

26:08.190 --> 26:09.941
He was your responsibility.

26:10.192 --> 26:12.944
- What about the cipher?
- I don't know, sir.

26:13.195 --> 26:14.946
Well, go and check.

26:15.197 --> 26:17.198
Yes, sir.

26:18.701 --> 26:20.034
- Mr. Pollock.
- Yes?

26:20.202 --> 26:22.954
- Do you have the inscription?
- It's in my pocket.

26:23.163 --> 26:25.832
I hope it's written with waterproof ink.

26:41.348 --> 26:43.224
- It isn't there.
- It isn't there?

26:43.434 --> 26:45.560
Must you mismanage everything?

26:50.482 --> 26:52.609
I don't know where
Mr. Pollock is either.

26:52.860 --> 26:55.486
What do you mean?
You've got to find him!

26:55.696 --> 26:58.323
Come up here at once,
and bring that butler of hers!

27:03.370 --> 27:05.371
What are you doing?

27:05.623 --> 27:08.374
- This is no time for dessert.
- Well, they're good.

27:08.584 --> 27:11.502
- Here, have one.
- Come on. Come on.

27:12.755 --> 27:15.465
- He is not on the ground floor, sir.
- You searched every room?

27:15.507 --> 27:17.258
Every room, sir.

27:18.636 --> 27:21.638
Sloane, Pollock was in your charge.

27:21.847 --> 27:23.890
I trusted you.

27:32.983 --> 27:38.154
- Now, you. What's your name?
- Hemsley, sir.

27:38.405 --> 27:41.366
Hemsley. Yes, of course.

27:41.533 --> 27:45.244
- What have you been up to, Hemsley?
- N-Nothing, sir.

27:45.496 --> 27:47.538
Have you been disobeying my orders?

27:47.790 --> 27:50.166
I-I work for Miss Azir, sir.

27:50.417 --> 27:53.753
So you do.
I appreciate loyalty, Hemsley.

27:53.921 --> 27:56.255
Tell me,
how would you like to work for me?

27:56.423 --> 27:59.425
I'm satisfied with my present position,
thank you.

27:59.677 --> 28:01.886
Are you?

28:02.137 --> 28:05.139
Please tell me when
you're dissatisfied with it, Hemsley.

28:19.697 --> 28:22.198
Welcome aboard, Hemsley.

28:22.408 --> 28:24.784
Thank you, sir.

28:27.454 --> 28:30.081
Don't worry, Hemsley. Here's a bonus.

28:35.337 --> 28:37.463
Oh. Well, thank you, sir.

28:37.673 --> 28:41.426
Don't mention it, Hemsley.
Would you like another bonus?

28:41.593 --> 28:44.846
Oh, not just now, sir,
if you don't mind, sir.

28:46.807 --> 28:50.309
- Where's Mr. Pollock?
- He came up here, sir.

28:51.437 --> 28:53.229
Up here?

28:53.439 --> 28:55.565
- Where up here?
- To this room, sir.

29:04.700 --> 29:07.493
No hanky-panky, Mr. Beshraavi.

29:07.745 --> 29:09.495
From man or bird.

29:09.747 --> 29:13.082
Believe him, Nejim. He means it.
He said he'd kill me.

29:37.357 --> 29:39.400
Close the door, lady.

29:42.529 --> 29:44.489
Lock it.

29:46.658 --> 29:48.910
Get him, Mustafa.

29:49.161 --> 29:51.788
But carefully.
Whatever he does to Miss Azir,

29:51.997 --> 29:54.373
I will do to you, personally.

30:25.572 --> 30:29.033
Don't think that I haven't enjoyed it.
It's been a nice change.

30:29.284 --> 30:33.704
- Thanks a lot. Bye now.
- No, they won't shoot if I'm with you.

30:33.956 --> 30:36.082
You still need me.

30:38.210 --> 30:41.087
Need you?
Lady, I can't live without you.

36:35.442 --> 36:39.111
Messy business. My apologies, miss.

36:39.321 --> 36:41.363
I'm sorry you had to see it.

36:41.615 --> 36:43.616
Was I glad to see you?

36:44.743 --> 36:47.745
- Are you with the police?
- lnspector Webster, CID.

36:49.873 --> 36:51.749
How in the world did you know?

36:52.000 --> 36:56.128
We've been watching the house.
Nasty customers.

36:56.379 --> 36:57.755
My house?

36:57.964 --> 37:00.883
Yes, miss. Since
Mr. Beshraavi's been staying with you.

37:01.092 --> 37:04.845
Might I suggest we move along?
We'll have to get down to the station.

37:05.096 --> 37:09.642
All right, all right. Who's the ruddy
nit who's broke my tank downstairs?

37:09.893 --> 37:13.479
- I'm up to me neck in drowning fishes.
- There's been some trouble.

37:13.647 --> 37:17.983
Oh, and who are you?
The ruddy Sheriff of Sherwood Forest?

37:18.151 --> 37:20.027
Webster, CID.

37:20.278 --> 37:22.029
Oh. Oh, I see.

37:22.280 --> 37:25.241
You better let me see your card.
I've got to make a report.

37:25.492 --> 37:27.368
Somebody's got to pay for them fish.

37:27.619 --> 37:28.744
Yes, of course.

37:34.167 --> 37:36.794
All right, let's go.

37:37.045 --> 37:40.297
I don't get it. Whose side are you on?

37:40.548 --> 37:43.259
What difference does it make?
Let's get out of here.

37:44.928 --> 37:48.681
You're not with the authorities,
and you're not with Beshraavi.

37:48.890 --> 37:51.058
And you can't be
with Prime Minister Jena.

37:52.185 --> 37:54.645
Who are you with?

37:54.813 --> 37:56.021
Her.

38:00.277 --> 38:02.152
Swell.

38:20.797 --> 38:23.340
Ain't it a gas about my promotion?

38:23.550 --> 38:26.302
Number three to General Ali himself.

38:26.469 --> 38:30.180
He's coming round, waking up.

38:31.224 --> 38:33.309
So you're with us again, teach.

38:33.476 --> 38:37.187
I don't know whether I am or not.
Whose side are you on?

38:37.355 --> 38:39.481
Don't worry about sides, daddy-o.

38:39.733 --> 38:42.609
Yussef Kasim is the name.
Kyle Webster you've met.

38:42.861 --> 38:45.362
And dear Miss Azir.

38:45.613 --> 38:50.075
For a poor, subjugated Arab lady, you
lead one hell of an emancipated life.

38:50.327 --> 38:55.205
Mr. Beshraavi on the one hand,
and Mr. Yussef Kasim on the other.

38:55.373 --> 38:57.499
Do you get Sundays off?

38:57.751 --> 39:00.377
Skip the college talk, teach.

39:00.628 --> 39:04.214
To the point, daddy-o:
Where is the cipher?

39:05.842 --> 39:08.510
- The cipher?
- Yeah, the cipher.

39:08.720 --> 39:13.891
We know you've got it. No point fooling.
You're in the middle of nowhere.

39:14.142 --> 39:16.852
The Marines can't
save you for democracy here.

39:17.020 --> 39:18.604
That cipher, where is it?

39:18.772 --> 39:21.982
- Ask me later, alligator.
- Where is it?

39:26.363 --> 39:29.531
I left it at Beshraavi's.

39:29.783 --> 39:32.409
After all, it belongs to him.

39:32.660 --> 39:35.120
Wrong again, teach. He snatched it.

39:35.372 --> 39:37.915
It belongs to this cat right here.

39:38.124 --> 39:39.917
Where is it?

39:40.126 --> 39:43.545
Miss Azir,
after all we've been through together,

39:43.797 --> 39:47.674
couldn't you find it in your heart
to put in a small word on my behalf?

39:47.926 --> 39:50.427
He told me he had it in his pocket.

39:51.888 --> 39:53.430
Tattletale.

39:53.640 --> 39:55.766
- Where is it?
- Cool it, Webster!

39:56.017 --> 39:57.684
There's a better way.

40:13.076 --> 40:16.328
Nice business associates you have,
Miss Azir.

40:16.579 --> 40:18.580
Why don't you tell them where it is?

40:20.208 --> 40:22.960
Because I don't know where it is.

40:23.211 --> 40:26.338
- You told me you had it.
- You told me lots of things too.

40:26.589 --> 40:30.175
Looks like we're just
a pair of pathological liars.

40:30.427 --> 40:32.553
I was honest about one thing.

40:32.804 --> 40:34.721
I told you to keep out of this,
didn't I?

40:34.973 --> 40:38.684
- That you did.
- Then why didn't you listen to me?

40:38.935 --> 40:41.728
Because I'm such a big know-it-all.

40:41.980 --> 40:47.234
OK, teach, here's your chance
to be a big "tell-it-all."

40:47.444 --> 40:50.946
Somehow I get the idea
you've seen too much television.

40:51.197 --> 40:53.073
Webster.

41:07.714 --> 41:11.216
Hey, Miss Azir, come on down here
and I'll scrub your back.

41:18.641 --> 41:22.019
Professor, can you hear me?

41:22.645 --> 41:28.984
An earnest professor of math
studied figures while taking a bath.

41:29.777 --> 41:33.489
Professor,
what did you do with the cipher?

41:33.740 --> 41:38.035
Cipher, cipher, who's got the cipher?

41:38.286 --> 41:42.164
- Number nine's got the cipher.
- "Nine"? What's that mean?

41:42.415 --> 41:45.751
That's for me to know and you to guess.

41:45.919 --> 41:47.044
Where is it?

41:49.672 --> 41:51.507
That tickles.

41:51.674 --> 41:57.137
Professor, you can tell me.
Where is the cipher?

41:58.389 --> 42:03.560
Candy, I call my sugar Candy...

42:03.811 --> 42:06.188
This is beginning to bug me.
Let's get rid of him.

42:06.439 --> 42:08.690
- What are you going to do?
- Dump him.

42:08.942 --> 42:11.443
- You heard him. He doesn't have it.
- Then who does?

42:11.694 --> 42:14.279
That's what you're going to find out,
sweet mama,

42:14.531 --> 42:18.700
as soon as you scoot on home
and ask your rich sugar daddy. Webster.

43:10.878 --> 43:13.005
Ole! Ole!

43:14.132 --> 43:16.633
Ole!

43:17.760 --> 43:20.470
Ole! Ole! Ole!

44:53.731 --> 44:57.234
- We were quite worried about you.
- Were you, Hemsley? How sweet.

44:57.485 --> 44:59.986
But I expected to see you
wearing a burnous by now.

45:00.238 --> 45:01.488
I'm sorry, miss.

45:01.739 --> 45:05.575
Don't sulk, Hemsley. I'm in no position
to throw the first stone.

45:05.827 --> 45:07.869
Allah be praised, miss.

45:10.623 --> 45:12.624
Yasmin, there you are.

45:12.875 --> 45:15.627
I'm so delighted that you've decided
to come back.

45:15.837 --> 45:17.879
Your concern is so comforting, Nejim.

45:18.131 --> 45:20.590
Your shower must have been
quite stimulating.

45:20.758 --> 45:21.883
It was.

45:22.093 --> 45:25.637
But how do you suppose he happened
to be in there, my pet?

45:25.888 --> 45:27.639
I neglected to ask him.

45:27.890 --> 45:32.269
All I know is he was waiting for me
with those scissors when I stepped in.

45:32.478 --> 45:35.230
I wonder what made him come up
here in the first place?

45:35.398 --> 45:37.899
I don't suppose it could have
been your promise

45:38.109 --> 45:41.153
to keep him a prisoner here
until he'd finished his work.

45:41.404 --> 45:44.781
Oh, dear, I hope not.
I thought I was being so hospitable.

45:45.032 --> 45:48.493
Westerners so often misunderstand us,
don't you find?

45:48.745 --> 45:52.038
Oh, I am exhausted.

45:53.750 --> 45:56.376
Of course you are, my poor darling.

45:56.544 --> 45:58.128
Let me give you a massage.

45:58.379 --> 46:02.424
How can you continue being
so good to me when I'm such a trial?

46:02.633 --> 46:04.676
Oh, look at your poor shoes.

46:04.886 --> 46:07.804
You must have done so much running.

46:08.681 --> 46:10.807
What do you suppose happened to Mustafa?

46:11.017 --> 46:13.685
- He hasn't come back yet.
- Dead, I'm afraid.

46:13.936 --> 46:16.188
And servants so hard
to come by these days.

46:16.397 --> 46:20.442
I saw several possible replacements
at the zoo.

46:20.693 --> 46:22.944
My admiration for Mr. Pollock increases.

46:23.196 --> 46:25.530
Probably Mustafa didn't feel like dying.

46:25.698 --> 46:27.574
Mr. Pollock didn't do it, darling.

46:29.952 --> 46:32.454
Don't stop. It feels divine.

46:35.833 --> 46:37.584
It was Yussef Kasim.

46:38.211 --> 46:39.711
The guerrilla forces.

46:39.962 --> 46:42.172
I was wondering what they were up to.

46:42.340 --> 46:47.219
I must say, they were a little miffed
at you for borrowing their cipher.

46:47.470 --> 46:50.722
I really don't think they had a chance
to see it themselves.

46:52.058 --> 46:54.100
Roll over, my love.

46:55.102 --> 46:59.439
Do you think you can find the energy to
tell me what they did to our professor?

46:59.607 --> 47:01.983
Killed him too, I'm afraid.

47:03.194 --> 47:04.861
That's heaven.

47:04.987 --> 47:08.114
- So Yussef has the cipher now?
- What makes you think that?

47:08.366 --> 47:11.701
Surely they were able to make
poor Mr. Pollock relinquish it.

47:11.953 --> 47:14.246
Mr. Pollock swore he didn't have it.

47:14.497 --> 47:16.248
Mr. Pollock was lying.

47:16.499 --> 47:19.376
Then I'm afraid he took
the truth with him to his grave.

47:19.585 --> 47:21.628
Before you came home I received word

47:21.879 --> 47:25.715
that Mr. Pollock had arrived safely
at his rooms at Oxford.

47:25.883 --> 47:27.968
A hardy race, the Americans.

47:28.135 --> 47:32.889
I was also told that he was riding a
bicycle and singing a very strange song.

47:33.266 --> 47:35.267
A hardy and fun-loving race.

47:35.518 --> 47:39.896
But tell me, my flower,
I don't think you've explained yet

47:40.147 --> 47:43.525
how it happens that Yussef
managed to leave you alive.

47:43.776 --> 47:47.904
It's very simple, really.
I promised I'd work with him.

47:48.114 --> 47:50.532
- By spying on me, you mean?
- Of course.

47:50.783 --> 47:52.534
- How very amusing.
- Isn't it?

47:52.785 --> 47:55.537
- Marvelous, in fact.
- I knew you'd enjoy it.

47:57.039 --> 47:58.665
- Darling?
- Yes, precious?

47:58.916 --> 48:03.503
- You are hurting my shoulders.
- Am I? Oh, I'm so sorry.

48:06.007 --> 48:08.300
- Better?
- Much.

48:08.551 --> 48:11.177
You must have been very convincing.

48:11.429 --> 48:13.638
It's a feminine talent.

48:14.432 --> 48:17.434
Well, what a waste not to exploit it.

48:17.685 --> 48:20.186
I was going to send Sloane
to see Mr. Pollock

48:20.438 --> 48:22.939
to convince him to return the cipher.

48:23.190 --> 48:25.567
But Sloane has so few subtle qualities.

48:25.776 --> 48:29.696
I'm sure the professor
would much rather deal with you.

48:29.947 --> 48:32.198
I thought you werejealous
of the professor.

48:33.075 --> 48:37.329
I'm too busy now
being jealous of Yussef.

49:02.688 --> 49:04.314
- Hello.
- Mr. Pollock.

49:04.565 --> 49:07.609
One moment, please,
for the Prime Minister.

49:09.487 --> 49:10.695
Mr. Pollock.

49:13.240 --> 49:14.240
Good morning, sir.

49:14.492 --> 49:19.371
We've been trying to contact you, Mr.
Pollock. We were very worried about you.

49:19.580 --> 49:21.498
No more than I was, sir.

49:21.749 --> 49:23.833
- Did you get the information?
- No, sir.

49:24.001 --> 49:25.877
- But you do have the cipher?
- No, sir.

49:26.128 --> 49:27.963
Do you know who does?

49:28.130 --> 49:31.132
- I think so, sir.
- Will you be getting it then?

49:31.384 --> 49:33.760
- No, sir.
- Why is that, Mr. Pollock?

49:33.970 --> 49:36.763
- No guts, sir.
- I beg your pardon?

49:36.973 --> 49:41.393
As long as you needed someone
to sit down and work, I was your man.

49:41.644 --> 49:44.980
But the situation has changed somewhat.

49:45.147 --> 49:49.901
What you need now is someone
with a Ph.D in roughhouse.

49:50.152 --> 49:52.862
I did warn you that
it might become dangerous.

49:53.030 --> 49:56.658
Well, dangerous, sir, not lethal.

49:56.909 --> 49:59.661
Yes. Yes, you are quite right.

49:59.870 --> 50:01.538
I apologize, Mr. Pollock.

50:01.789 --> 50:04.416
When one is willing to die
for national honor,

50:04.667 --> 50:06.668
it is hard to remember that other people

50:06.919 --> 50:09.254
have equally important values
to live for.

50:09.505 --> 50:12.048
There is no reason why you, an outsider,

50:12.258 --> 50:15.260
should risk such a sacrifice
for another man's country.

50:15.428 --> 50:19.556
You... You take unfair advantage,
Mr. Prime Minister.

50:19.765 --> 50:21.307
How so?

50:21.517 --> 50:24.269
By appealing to a man's
better instincts.

50:24.437 --> 50:30.692
- I was confident that you had them.
- Well... very well, sir.

50:30.943 --> 50:34.821
Where would you like me to be...
murdered this time?

50:35.031 --> 50:37.824
Try and find the inscription if you can.

50:38.034 --> 50:41.077
Decipher it,
and call me the moment you have.

50:41.328 --> 50:46.082
- Time is getting very short and...
- David. David.

50:46.333 --> 50:48.334
Thank God you're all right.

50:51.547 --> 50:53.840
This isn't your house.

50:54.050 --> 50:57.802
This is my house,
and you weren't invited. So go away.

50:57.970 --> 51:01.222
I didn't even know you were alive,
but I came to warn you anyway.

51:01.474 --> 51:02.474
About what?

51:02.725 --> 51:05.810
Nejim's men are on their way here
to get the cipher back.

51:05.978 --> 51:08.605
- You've got to get away.
- Now slow down a minute.

51:08.856 --> 51:11.107
Aren't you the same Miss Azir

51:11.358 --> 51:14.486
whojust stood there
while your friends tried to kill me?

51:14.737 --> 51:17.489
Oh, David!
You don't think I enjoyed that?

51:17.740 --> 51:21.242
- Well, so long as you didn't enjoy it.
- There was nothing I could do.

51:23.120 --> 51:25.205
You've got to listen to me!

51:25.372 --> 51:28.833
Every time I listen to you,
someone either hits me over the head

51:29.085 --> 51:31.211
or tries to vaccinate me.

51:31.378 --> 51:33.880
Maybe it's time
that I called the police.

51:34.090 --> 51:36.216
You mustn't do that.

51:36.383 --> 51:38.885
What do you suggest then,
the Salvation Army?

51:39.095 --> 51:42.514
- Come with me, before it's too late.
- What?

51:42.765 --> 51:47.018
And wind up back in Yussef Kasim's
rumble seat? No, thank you.

51:47.269 --> 51:50.772
Tell your boyfriend I'm a bad sport.

51:51.023 --> 51:55.026
If I'd let him kill me,
I'd never have forgiven myself.

51:56.278 --> 51:59.239
Yussef is not my boyfriend.
I loathe him.

51:59.490 --> 52:02.659
Of course you do.
You just do what he tells you

52:02.868 --> 52:06.996
because he's holding your family hostage
back in the old country.

52:07.248 --> 52:09.999
- How did you know that?
- Oh, come on.

52:10.251 --> 52:12.293
I've seen that movie.

52:13.671 --> 52:15.922
General Ali Ben Ali,

52:16.132 --> 52:18.758
the man he works for,

52:18.926 --> 52:21.678
threatened to kill my mother and sisters

52:21.929 --> 52:24.264
unless I cooperated with him.

52:24.515 --> 52:28.184
And Beshraavi, who's he got,
your Uncle Max from Newark?

52:28.435 --> 52:30.186
- What do you mean?
- Forget it.

52:30.437 --> 52:34.440
If you want to live with Ali Baba and
the Forty Thieves, that's your business.

52:34.692 --> 52:37.068
Do you think I like being near
that degenerate?

52:37.319 --> 52:39.279
I have to. Don't you understand?

52:39.530 --> 52:42.782
Yussef ordered me to meet him
and to cultivate his friendship,

52:42.950 --> 52:44.951
so I could report on his actions.

52:45.202 --> 52:47.203
Anyway, the pay is good.

52:49.832 --> 52:54.169
It's not the money.
I swear it. It's my family.

52:54.336 --> 52:58.089
Oh, look, everyone's got problems,
including me,

52:58.340 --> 53:01.593
so I'd just as soon
not get mixed up in yours.

53:02.845 --> 53:06.472
But you are mixed up in them,
whether you like it or not.

53:06.682 --> 53:10.810
Beshraavi wants to rule our country with
his money, General Ali with his guns.

53:10.978 --> 53:13.229
Both must know
what's in that inscription.

53:13.439 --> 53:15.356
That means they need you.

53:15.608 --> 53:19.319
David, you must believe
that I hate them both,

53:19.570 --> 53:22.488
that I'm only doing what they want
because I have to.

53:22.740 --> 53:27.452
If you can translate the inscription
and we can get it to my embassy,

53:27.703 --> 53:29.746
we'll both be safe.

53:31.874 --> 53:35.376
Yeah, well,
It sounds reasonable, I guess.

53:35.628 --> 53:38.129
Then... you believe me?

53:39.632 --> 53:43.885
In this cynical old world,
you have to believe in something.

53:44.094 --> 53:46.262
So, it might as well be you.

53:46.513 --> 53:49.265
- OK, I'll buy it.
- Thank you.

53:49.475 --> 53:52.101
Take it easy.
I'm not quite myself this morning.

53:52.269 --> 53:53.394
You're wonderful.

53:53.520 --> 53:57.774
Yeah, if I could find my head,
I'd go get it examined.

53:57.983 --> 54:01.402
If we're going to have visitors,
we better get out of here.

54:02.238 --> 54:04.781
Want to give it to me now?

54:04.990 --> 54:07.617
- Give what to you?
- The inscription.

54:09.161 --> 54:11.788
- I don't have it.
- Well, who does?

54:12.039 --> 54:15.124
- You do.
- Me? No, no.

54:15.292 --> 54:19.003
You've forgotten, Yussef took it from me
in the van last night.

54:19.255 --> 54:21.172
But he couldn't find it.

54:25.177 --> 54:30.139
Yeah, he found it.
He just didn't know that he'd found it.

54:31.558 --> 54:35.436
Maybe we can still get it back...
with a little help from you.

54:44.196 --> 54:45.822
Where's Yussef?

54:46.073 --> 54:48.324
It's all right. He's down there.

54:50.160 --> 54:51.953
OK, where is it?

54:52.162 --> 54:54.205
Over there, I think. Come on.

54:57.418 --> 54:59.294
Must have had pups during the night.

55:00.337 --> 55:04.340
I'll know it when I see it.
He dented it last week.

55:04.591 --> 55:07.677
How? Knocking down
an old lady at a crossing?

55:07.928 --> 55:09.846
There it is.

55:14.852 --> 55:16.728
Hey, hey.

55:18.230 --> 55:22.108
- It's still there.
- I don't see anything.

55:22.318 --> 55:24.861
The candy! You are brilliant!

55:25.112 --> 55:28.114
The result of a clean mind
and a healthy body.

55:31.243 --> 55:33.119
Yussef.

55:49.720 --> 55:52.972
I've checked all the morning papers.
There's not a word.

55:53.140 --> 55:56.601
- Do you think he's still alive?
- Stop bugging me. How would I know?

55:56.769 --> 55:58.644
Have you heard from the girl?

55:58.896 --> 56:02.106
She'll give me a blast
when she knows something.

56:09.406 --> 56:13.534
Oh, no, he's taking it.
Why couldn't he be on a diet?

56:13.660 --> 56:15.119
What do you know?

56:24.671 --> 56:27.548
- Thirty-five. Which one is it?
- Number nine.

56:27.758 --> 56:30.927
- You were actually telling the truth.
- What do you mean?

56:31.178 --> 56:33.638
Yussef was here. I was here.
The cipher was here.

56:33.806 --> 56:36.432
All you had to do was yell,
but you didn't.

56:36.683 --> 56:39.811
That absurd story about your mother
and sisters must be true.

56:40.062 --> 56:42.313
- You mean you didn't believe me?
- Not a word.

56:42.564 --> 56:45.691
- Then why did you come with me?
- I didn't know where the van was.

56:45.943 --> 56:48.027
Miss Azir, I humbly apologize.

56:48.195 --> 56:52.949
I don't accept. The least you can do
when I tell you something is believe it.

56:53.200 --> 56:54.909
With your track record?

56:57.579 --> 56:59.789
Let's go. Be ready to duck.

57:04.336 --> 57:08.297
- Fourteen.
- I only hope his sweet tooth holds up.

57:30.070 --> 57:32.613
We're victims of the Establishment.

57:32.823 --> 57:34.365
Ask him to move.

57:34.575 --> 57:37.326
It's no use.
They can't move, speak or even listen.

57:37.578 --> 57:39.454
If they do, they're beheaded.

57:39.705 --> 57:41.873
Oh, nonsense. He's a man, isn't he?

57:44.877 --> 57:48.629
- Excuse me, soldier.
- He's a guardsman.

57:53.510 --> 57:56.137
Excuse me, guardsman.

57:56.388 --> 57:59.015
I'm sorry to bother you.

57:59.766 --> 58:02.477
I know you're on duty, but...

58:09.902 --> 58:14.864
There is something under your foot
that belongs to us.

58:15.032 --> 58:16.908
OK?

58:18.744 --> 58:20.620
Please.

58:21.747 --> 58:24.499
Pretty please.

58:24.666 --> 58:27.668
David, make him lift his foot!

58:39.181 --> 58:41.516
You've been learning from Nejim.

58:43.644 --> 58:47.313
Fifty-two! You'd think after all that...

59:00.077 --> 59:02.828
Oh, no. He's found it.

59:03.080 --> 59:04.956
Sink, sank, sunk.

59:17.970 --> 59:21.222
- He must be calling Yussef.
- I don't think so.

59:21.473 --> 59:23.558
He knows Yussef's number.

59:57.509 --> 59:59.594
Keep an eye on Webster.

01:00:01.847 --> 01:00:03.264
Look here.

01:00:04.266 --> 01:00:07.727
Webster sold out to Nejim.

01:00:07.894 --> 01:00:10.646
Seems to be a popular
indoor sport these days.

01:00:10.897 --> 01:00:13.024
You're not including me, I hope.

01:00:13.233 --> 01:00:15.526
Of course not.
We're believing you today.

01:00:16.153 --> 01:00:20.031
- 3:30, but it doesn't say where.
- It doesn't have to.

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:25.286
If he's meeting Nejim at 3:30,
there's only one place it can be.

01:00:25.662 --> 01:00:29.373
In the fifth race
the runners are as follows...

01:00:33.003 --> 01:00:34.920
I must go and advise my horse.

01:00:35.172 --> 01:00:37.548
- Are you coming, my love?
- You go, my darling.

01:00:37.799 --> 01:00:39.800
I think I'll put some money on her.

01:00:40.052 --> 01:00:42.553
What an excellent idea.
But only to win, of course.

01:00:42.804 --> 01:00:46.265
It would be a grave mistake to back
another horse at this late stage.

01:01:10.832 --> 01:01:13.417
Well, if it isn't Mr. Dillingham.

01:01:13.669 --> 01:01:18.464
By Jove, it's actually
Lady Hetherington-Cartwright.

01:01:18.715 --> 01:01:21.592
- Don't overdo it.
- I didn't know you could.

01:01:21.802 --> 01:01:23.427
I haven't seen Webster.

01:01:23.595 --> 01:01:27.223
He's handing the inscription to Sloane
at 3:30 by the winning post.

01:01:27.474 --> 01:01:30.226
- Do be a dear, Mr. Dillingworth.
- Ham.

01:01:30.477 --> 01:01:34.730
Dillingham. Tell me what you fancy
for this race.

01:01:34.981 --> 01:01:38.317
I'm putting myjolly old shirt
on number nine.

01:01:38.485 --> 01:01:41.862
Keep your eyes on the winning post.
You'll have to get it somehow.

01:01:42.114 --> 01:01:45.449
- And then what?
- Meet at Trafalgar Square at midnight.

01:01:45.617 --> 01:01:50.454
It's been positively smash to have
bumped into you this way, old thing.

01:01:50.622 --> 01:01:55.209
Do give my regards to your husband
next visiting day.

01:01:55.377 --> 01:01:57.461
- Ta-ta.
- Toodle-oo.

01:02:31.747 --> 01:02:33.622
What odds did you get?

01:02:40.505 --> 01:02:41.797
Two to one.

01:02:43.884 --> 01:02:45.926
They're off.

01:03:12.204 --> 01:03:14.580
It's Pollock.

01:03:28.845 --> 01:03:31.430
Who is that?

01:03:33.350 --> 01:03:37.353
They're turning into the stretch.
Three furlongs left to race, and it's...

01:03:39.981 --> 01:03:43.484
That bungling idiot, Sloane.

01:04:08.718 --> 01:04:11.136
Darling, we won!

01:05:29.799 --> 01:05:32.092
- Hello?
- Prime Minister Jena, please.

01:05:32.302 --> 01:05:34.345
It's very urgent. This is Mr. Pollock.

01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:37.222
Pollock.

01:05:38.725 --> 01:05:41.060
Mr. Pollock, what has happened?

01:05:41.227 --> 01:05:44.104
Mr. Jena, there's been some trouble.

01:05:44.314 --> 01:05:47.316
- A man was killed at Ascot today.
- Yes, I heard.

01:05:47.567 --> 01:05:50.235
Have you also heard
who it is they think killed him?

01:05:50.487 --> 01:05:54.073
Mrs. Pollock's idiot son, David,
that's who. I need your help.

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:57.493
I don't think there's anything
I can do for you right now,

01:05:57.744 --> 01:06:00.579
besides suggesting that
you stay clear of the police.

01:06:00.747 --> 01:06:03.749
Mr. Prime Minister,
I don't think I've made myself clear.

01:06:03.959 --> 01:06:05.584
Right now I'm wanted for murder.

01:06:05.835 --> 01:06:08.837
You're the only one who can explain
what I've been doing.

01:06:09.089 --> 01:06:12.633
But, Mr. Pollock,
I thought I'd made myself clear.

01:06:12.884 --> 01:06:15.970
For security reasons,
I have never seen you.

01:06:16.221 --> 01:06:18.514
I am not even in England.

01:06:18.723 --> 01:06:23.519
Whatever the circumstances,
we must disclaim any knowledge of you.

01:06:24.396 --> 01:06:27.648
Where are you? Have you the message?

01:06:29.609 --> 01:06:31.986
If the message
is not deciphered soon, then...

01:06:36.241 --> 01:06:38.617
Come here, my darling.

01:06:41.913 --> 01:06:45.040
- I brought you some presents.
- How sweet.

01:06:47.293 --> 01:06:49.044
More shoes?

01:06:49.295 --> 01:06:51.797
But, darling,
you've already given me dozens.

01:06:52.048 --> 01:06:54.049
I couldn't resist these.

01:06:54.926 --> 01:06:59.680
Quite a coincidence, Mr. Pollock turning
up at the right place and right time.

01:06:59.931 --> 01:07:03.183
- Don't you think so?
- I would hardly call it a coincidence.

01:07:03.435 --> 01:07:08.063
Neither would I.
How do you account for it, my flower?

01:07:08.273 --> 01:07:13.068
He must have been following
Yussef's man, the one who was killed.

01:07:13.278 --> 01:07:16.572
- Do you think so?
- It's the only explanation.

01:07:16.823 --> 01:07:19.033
You wouldn't have
mentioned it, of course.

01:07:19.284 --> 01:07:21.702
I?

01:07:22.787 --> 01:07:25.330
Those are rather attractive,
don't you think?

01:07:25.582 --> 01:07:27.583
Exquisite.

01:07:28.835 --> 01:07:33.088
I really must thank whoever
was responsible for getting him there.

01:07:33.339 --> 01:07:36.925
- Then you wanted him to have it?
- Certainly.

01:07:37.177 --> 01:07:39.344
Who else is going to decipher it?

01:07:39.596 --> 01:07:41.930
I want you to find him again,

01:07:42.182 --> 01:07:45.726
I want you to stay with him
until he finishes his work,

01:07:45.977 --> 01:07:49.229
and then I want you
to bring the answers to me.

01:07:49.481 --> 01:07:54.485
- Is that clear, my angel?
- Very clear.

01:07:55.987 --> 01:07:59.114
I know that I can trust you
to do that for me.

01:07:59.324 --> 01:08:02.618
Unless, of course,
you're growing weary of my little gifts.

01:08:02.869 --> 01:08:07.873
Oh, and if I don't
hear from you by noon tomorrow

01:08:08.124 --> 01:08:12.002
try and think of some remote corner
of the world where I won't find you.

01:08:12.212 --> 01:08:15.631
I don't think you can... but try.

01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:32.106
Thank you, sir.

01:08:39.363 --> 01:08:42.323
- Mrs. Ragheeb?
- Oh, but, sir...

01:08:42.575 --> 01:08:44.743
I must speak to Mrs. Ragheeb.

01:09:02.011 --> 01:09:06.640
Mrs. Ragheeb, I'm an associate
of Professor Ragheeb at Oxford.

01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:10.727
This is tremendously urgent.
It's about your husband's... murder.

01:09:11.645 --> 01:09:13.897
Murder? Why do you say "murder"?

01:09:18.778 --> 01:09:22.738
Your husband was murdered
by some agent of Nejim Beshraavi.

01:09:22.991 --> 01:09:26.743
He was killed for a Hittite inscription.
I don't know why.

01:09:26.995 --> 01:09:30.413
- I know very little, but I know that.
- No, Amir.

01:09:30.665 --> 01:09:34.042
Mrs. Ragheeb, I know this is
a terrible time to trouble you,

01:09:34.294 --> 01:09:37.004
but I've got to know
what that inscription means.

01:09:37.171 --> 01:09:39.923
I thought, perhaps,
among your husband's notes...

01:09:40.133 --> 01:09:44.136
- A Hittite inscription, you say?
- Did he tell you anything about it?

01:09:44.304 --> 01:09:46.889
Show it to me.

01:09:51.310 --> 01:09:52.310
Mrs. Ragheeb...

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:55.272
I told him he was mad
to meddle in such things.

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:57.774
Madness and suicide.

01:09:58.026 --> 01:10:01.195
And now... he's in there.

01:10:01.446 --> 01:10:03.947
But he must have told you something.

01:10:04.199 --> 01:10:07.701
He must have mentioned where he got it,
who gave it to him.

01:10:07.952 --> 01:10:11.538
- We have to know.
- "We"? Who else?

01:10:11.706 --> 01:10:15.334
A girl. Her family's in great danger.

01:10:15.585 --> 01:10:18.462
Her mother and sisters,
General Ali will kill them.

01:10:18.671 --> 01:10:22.799
- Is the girl named Yasmin Azir?
- Yes.

01:10:23.051 --> 01:10:26.553
And she told you that her mother
and her sisters are in danger?

01:10:26.721 --> 01:10:28.555
Yes.

01:10:28.723 --> 01:10:32.351
Yasmin has no such family, Mr. Pollock.

01:10:32.602 --> 01:10:34.353
There is only her father.

01:10:34.604 --> 01:10:37.064
General Ali would never harm him.

01:10:38.733 --> 01:10:43.612
- Why not?
- Because General Ali is her father.

01:11:07.512 --> 01:11:09.596
David, I was so worried about you.

01:11:09.764 --> 01:11:11.598
Oh, you were?

01:11:11.766 --> 01:11:14.977
The police think you killed Webster.
Have you seen the papers?

01:11:15.228 --> 01:11:18.397
I don't care what they say
as long as they spell my name right.

01:11:18.606 --> 01:11:23.026
I had a hard time convincing Nejim I had
nothing to do with your being at Ascot.

01:11:23.278 --> 01:11:26.280
I'm sure that you were very convincing.

01:11:26.489 --> 01:11:28.907
I told him you must have been
following Webster,

01:11:29.158 --> 01:11:34.121
- but I'm not sure he believed me.
- How could anyone not believe you?

01:11:34.289 --> 01:11:37.791
He made me promise
to keep you working on the cipher

01:11:38.042 --> 01:11:40.419
and to call him
the moment you've broken it.

01:11:41.921 --> 01:11:43.422
- Oh, damn.
- What's wrong?

01:11:43.631 --> 01:11:47.175
Nejim had me followed when I left
the house but I thought I'd lost them.

01:11:47.427 --> 01:11:49.761
Now they're back again. Duck.

01:11:55.893 --> 01:11:58.562
Oh, it's all right. We lost them.

01:11:58.771 --> 01:12:02.065
Next time let me know
so I can fasten my seat belt.

01:12:03.067 --> 01:12:05.402
Where is the inscription? May I see it?

01:12:05.570 --> 01:12:07.696
Why do you want to see it?

01:12:07.947 --> 01:12:09.781
I don't know. I've never seen it.

01:12:09.949 --> 01:12:12.576
When you've seen one,
you've seen them all.

01:12:12.827 --> 01:12:16.830
- As long as you have it.
- Well, I don't have it.

01:12:17.081 --> 01:12:19.708
- What do you mean? Of course you have it!
- Look out!

01:12:25.089 --> 01:12:28.717
- Would you like me to drive?
- What have you done with it?

01:12:28.968 --> 01:12:32.346
Relax. I haven't forgotten
your mother and sisters.

01:12:32.597 --> 01:12:34.598
- I mailed it to myself.
- Oh, no.

01:12:34.849 --> 01:12:37.100
How will you be able to work on it?

01:12:37.352 --> 01:12:40.228
I won't have to. I know what's in it.

01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:43.357
What does it mean? Tell me.

01:12:43.608 --> 01:12:49.071
It said, "The... plague
shall not pass until the swans...

01:12:49.238 --> 01:12:51.990
fly high in the kingdom of Vesta."

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:56.495
- Vesta? What does that mean?
- How should I know?

01:12:56.746 --> 01:12:59.498
My job was to translate it into English.

01:12:59.749 --> 01:13:03.126
Well, I suppose it will
mean something to somebody.

01:13:03.378 --> 01:13:06.963
I'll call the embassy and tell them,
but I'd better drop you off first.

01:13:07.215 --> 01:13:10.258
- Where are you staying?
- Right here with you.

01:13:10.510 --> 01:13:14.262
It's not safe for you to be out on the
streets. What if the police stop us?

01:13:14.514 --> 01:13:17.015
The way you drive?
Why should they stop us?

01:13:18.142 --> 01:13:21.269
All right, David.
I'll look for a phone box.

01:13:21.521 --> 01:13:25.023
No, no, I'll look. That way maybe
we can keep from hitting it.

01:13:32.532 --> 01:13:34.783
- Want me to come with you?
- What for?

01:13:36.119 --> 01:13:39.788
- Think how cozy it would be.
- But so hard to dial.

01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:14.781
Don't tell me that the ambassador
spoke with you at this hour?

01:14:14.949 --> 01:14:17.075
As a matter of fact, he did.

01:14:17.326 --> 01:14:19.828
They are preparing
for Mr. Jena's visit tomorrow.

01:14:21.330 --> 01:14:23.457
What did he say?

01:14:23.666 --> 01:14:27.169
He didn't understand the message.
He said to come right over.

01:14:27.336 --> 01:14:32.424
Er... it's all right. You can
get out here. I'll meet you later.

01:14:32.675 --> 01:14:35.927
- Why?
- Stop asking so many questions.

01:14:36.179 --> 01:14:39.097
There are police at the embassy.
They'll recognize you.

01:14:39.307 --> 01:14:41.433
Do you want to be arrested for murder?

01:14:43.478 --> 01:14:48.106
All right. I'll meet you
in Knightsbridge at the Kelly Hotel.

01:14:48.357 --> 01:14:50.358
I'm registered in the name of O'Malley.

01:14:50.610 --> 01:14:54.446
- O'Malley?
- There's a discount if you're lrish.

01:15:02.997 --> 01:15:04.831
Follow that car.

01:15:04.999 --> 01:15:07.751
All my life
I've waited for somebody to say that.

01:15:31.609 --> 01:15:33.777
Thanks, guv. I enjoyed that.

01:16:02.056 --> 01:16:03.932
Yussef?

01:16:31.711 --> 01:16:34.462
Yasmin! Get down!

01:17:07.872 --> 01:17:11.124
- David, you followed me.
- No, I didn't.

01:17:11.375 --> 01:17:15.378
You went to the embassy
and I came here to my hotel.

01:17:42.406 --> 01:17:44.407
There. Over the wall.

01:17:54.752 --> 01:17:56.419
Wait!

01:18:03.552 --> 01:18:05.387
Down here.

01:18:05.638 --> 01:18:08.181
Can't say I care much for your embassy.

01:18:17.566 --> 01:18:21.695
David, I wasn't deceiving you. I had
to find out what the message means.

01:18:21.946 --> 01:18:24.906
Yussef is the only one who knows.
That's why I came here.

01:18:25.157 --> 01:18:27.450
Not one of your brighter ideas.

01:18:44.468 --> 01:18:47.929
- You stay here.
- David!

01:19:16.375 --> 01:19:19.002
Oh, David! Oh, David!

01:19:19.253 --> 01:19:22.505
I couldn't let you die
without hearing the end of your story.

01:19:22.715 --> 01:19:24.507
Come on!

01:19:25.384 --> 01:19:27.761
But it's true. Everything. I swear it.

01:19:27.970 --> 01:19:30.764
As true as your poor old mother
and your three sisters?

01:19:31.015 --> 01:19:33.767
- Of course.
- I went to Mrs. Ragheeb.

01:19:33.976 --> 01:19:37.270
- Oh, no.
- She was very well-informed about you.

01:19:37.521 --> 01:19:39.856
You told her you and I
were working together?

01:19:40.107 --> 01:19:41.524
- Naturally.
- No wonder.

01:19:41.734 --> 01:19:42.776
No wonder what?

01:19:42.902 --> 01:19:45.403
She'd say anything
to keep you from trusting me.

01:19:45.654 --> 01:19:49.657
She's an agent of Yussef's, like her
husband. Don't you see what you did?

01:19:49.867 --> 01:19:52.660
The moment you let her know
I was double-crossing them,

01:19:52.912 --> 01:19:54.746
she called Yussef to warn him.

01:19:54.914 --> 01:19:58.541
So he lured me to the construction site,
to kill me!

01:20:04.882 --> 01:20:08.885
What is there about you
that makes you so hard to believe?

01:20:11.055 --> 01:20:14.808
Perhaps it's because
I'm such a terrible liar.

01:20:15.059 --> 01:20:17.685
But never with you, of course.

01:20:17.937 --> 01:20:20.188
I wish I could say the same.

01:20:20.439 --> 01:20:26.694
"The plague shall not pass until the
swans fly high in the kingdom of Vesta."

01:20:26.946 --> 01:20:29.280
You made it up?

01:20:29.532 --> 01:20:32.534
- What's the real message?
- I haven't worked it out yet.

01:20:32.701 --> 01:20:36.204
We'll have to do something.
I packed a suitcase. It's in the back.

01:20:36.455 --> 01:20:41.084
I can't very well go back to my house.
Nejim isn't the understanding type.

01:20:41.293 --> 01:20:43.169
Haven't you any ideas?

01:20:46.715 --> 01:20:48.716
Yeah.

01:20:50.469 --> 01:20:52.178
Darling?

01:20:53.347 --> 01:20:55.348
I got the message.

01:21:05.734 --> 01:21:07.360
Yasmin!

01:21:11.699 --> 01:21:18.371
Good morning.

01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:23.835
Good morning, my darling.

01:21:24.003 --> 01:21:28.089
You pass bachelor's requirement number
one. You're lovely in the morning.

01:21:30.217 --> 01:21:34.596
I was dreaming of someone
much more romantic. You.

01:21:38.392 --> 01:21:41.269
No, come back here.
I have something else.

01:21:42.521 --> 01:21:44.522
I've cracked the cipher.

01:21:44.732 --> 01:21:47.901
David, that's wonderful.
What does it mean?

01:21:48.110 --> 01:21:50.403
It's a phony, 100 per cent phony.

01:21:50.654 --> 01:21:54.532
It isn't Hittite. it's an ordinary,
common-or-garden grade-school code.

01:21:54.783 --> 01:21:58.661
- Look. Here, you want these?
- No, certainly not.

01:21:58.871 --> 01:22:02.165
You see, bird sign,
bird sign, bird sign.

01:22:02.416 --> 01:22:04.918
Sex differentiation factor.

01:22:05.669 --> 01:22:06.794
You mean it's dirty?

01:22:07.046 --> 01:22:09.547
No, a three-year-old child
could understand.

01:22:09.798 --> 01:22:14.677
Female bird: goose.
Female bird: goose. Male bird: gander.

01:22:14.929 --> 01:22:16.679
"Whither do you wender..."

01:22:16.931 --> 01:22:18.681
- No, that's "wander".
- Wander.

01:22:18.933 --> 01:22:22.518
- "Upstairs, downstairs..."
- "Or in my lady's chamber."

01:22:22.686 --> 01:22:25.563
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

01:22:25.773 --> 01:22:30.401
We've got Beshraavi,
the British constabulary,

01:22:30.653 --> 01:22:33.196
the whole human race
howling after our blood

01:22:33.447 --> 01:22:36.074
just for a lousy nursery rhyme.

01:22:36.325 --> 01:22:39.577
- It's got to mean something.
- It must.

01:22:39.787 --> 01:22:42.580
- Who wrote it in the first place?
- Ragheeb, I imagine.

01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:44.415
Exactly. Ragheeb.

01:22:44.667 --> 01:22:50.922
"Upstairs, downstairs...
in my lady's chamber."

01:22:51.090 --> 01:22:53.466
Mrs. Ragheeb must have the answer.

01:22:53.717 --> 01:22:56.177
She couldn't have.
She would have told Yussef.

01:22:56.345 --> 01:22:58.221
That's right too.

01:22:58.472 --> 01:23:02.433
When I showed her a copy of it,
she tore it up.

01:23:02.685 --> 01:23:07.063
She looked at it,
and she didn't give a damn.

01:23:09.858 --> 01:23:14.737
- Wow!
- David... what are you talking about?

01:23:14.989 --> 01:23:18.616
A copy of the message means nothing,
the translation means nothing.

01:23:18.867 --> 01:23:21.577
The message is a screen. It's a doodle.

01:23:21.745 --> 01:23:24.956
All that matters
is the original piece of paper.

01:23:25.207 --> 01:23:28.626
- The original?
- Of course. it isn't the cipher.

01:23:28.877 --> 01:23:34.966
It's something else on that paper.
Something underneath the cipher.

01:23:35.217 --> 01:23:38.886
Arise, arise, oh, my beloved.

01:23:39.096 --> 01:23:41.139
To the Hammersmith Post Office.

01:23:50.024 --> 01:23:52.108
Have you got it?

01:23:52.901 --> 01:23:54.902
Don't you trust me with anything?

01:23:59.742 --> 01:24:01.617
No watermark.

01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:06.789
- What do you see?
- Gander, goosy, goosy.

01:24:07.041 --> 01:24:09.542
Just keep your eyes on the road.

01:24:11.295 --> 01:24:13.921
It must be here someplace.

01:24:15.799 --> 01:24:17.759
Are you burning it?

01:24:17.926 --> 01:24:20.636
That's how you detect invisible ink.

01:24:20.804 --> 01:24:25.141
- Weren't you ever in the Boy Scouts?
- I flunked the physical.

01:24:25.309 --> 01:24:28.436
You should have tried my troop.
We'd have waived it.

01:24:30.647 --> 01:24:33.816
Wait, wait! Stop the car!

01:24:34.026 --> 01:24:37.528
- What are you doing?
- I'm about to invent the wheel.

01:24:42.326 --> 01:24:45.078
Well, there it goes.

01:24:45.329 --> 01:24:49.332
- No, no, wait. Look!
- I don't see anything.

01:24:49.541 --> 01:24:52.794
The eye. The eye of the third bird.

01:24:53.045 --> 01:24:54.837
What's that?

01:24:55.047 --> 01:24:56.923
A microdot.

01:25:05.849 --> 01:25:08.976
- What do you see?
- Take a look.

01:25:09.228 --> 01:25:11.687
- She's a beauty, isn't she?
- She certainly is.

01:25:11.855 --> 01:25:15.358
But the microscope's a trifle small.
Haven't you anything larger?

01:25:15.609 --> 01:25:16.859
Certainly, sir.

01:25:18.112 --> 01:25:20.863
So that's what they
wanted Yussef to know.

01:25:21.073 --> 01:25:22.740
Something on this order, sir?

01:25:22.991 --> 01:25:25.576
I'm afraid not.
Haven't you anything larger?

01:25:25.744 --> 01:25:28.246
I'll look, sir.

01:25:28.497 --> 01:25:30.206
What do we do now?

01:25:30.457 --> 01:25:33.501
It says when, but it doesn't say where.
When is the 18th?

01:25:33.752 --> 01:25:36.003
Monday was the 14th.
Tuesday, Wednesday...

01:25:37.089 --> 01:25:38.756
- It's today.
- Today?

01:25:39.842 --> 01:25:41.884
Come on!

01:25:42.511 --> 01:25:45.221
This is the largest we have, sir.
Shall I...

01:25:46.348 --> 01:25:48.224
Hey, David, look!

01:26:43.822 --> 01:26:46.949
- Oh, no! Do something!
- Lift it out of the way?

01:26:47.201 --> 01:26:48.784
I don't care. Do anything!

01:26:48.952 --> 01:26:51.037
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

01:26:51.288 --> 01:26:53.915
Mr. Jena will be happy
to answer your questions now.

01:26:57.336 --> 01:27:00.046
All right, mate.
Lots of room. That's it.

01:27:00.214 --> 01:27:03.216
Keep on going.
Lots of leeway back there.

01:27:03.467 --> 01:27:07.428
Bring her on back, mate.
OK, fine. Plenty of leeway.

01:27:07.596 --> 01:27:12.225
Plenty of leeway. Lots of room.
Right on back. Good.

01:27:12.476 --> 01:27:15.561
Right on back, mate. Right on back.

01:27:15.812 --> 01:27:19.607
Fine, fine. Good. Plenty of room, mate.

01:27:21.693 --> 01:27:23.736
That's good.

01:27:24.988 --> 01:27:26.948
Thanks, mate.

01:27:32.079 --> 01:27:36.749
This is your first visit to England.
What are your first impressions?

01:27:36.875 --> 01:27:40.336
We could use some of your
English rain in our dry country.

01:27:44.216 --> 01:27:48.386
In our country, there's a great deal
of oil and very little water.

01:27:48.595 --> 01:27:51.514
A highly inflammable situation.

01:27:51.723 --> 01:27:53.349
All right, Hemsley.

01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:11.409
Water remains our most serious problem.

01:28:11.618 --> 01:28:14.412
To paraphrase Marie Antoinette:

01:28:14.621 --> 01:28:18.749
I can hardly say of my people,
"Let them drink oil."

01:28:29.136 --> 01:28:31.512
May I see your press card, please, sir?

01:28:35.934 --> 01:28:38.686
Diners Club?
I'm afraid I don't recognize you.

01:28:38.937 --> 01:28:41.439
We're doing a piece
on the Arabic cuisine.

01:28:41.648 --> 01:28:44.567
- I'm sorry, sir. It's not on my list.
- Get out of the way.

01:28:44.818 --> 01:28:46.068
I'm sorry, sir.

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:49.280
Would you comment
on the treaty you intend signing?

01:28:49.448 --> 01:28:53.409
You've been misinformed, sir.
I shall not sign the treaty.

01:28:53.577 --> 01:28:55.036
- Listen!
- Let us through!

01:28:55.203 --> 01:28:58.831
- He's about to be killed!
- I hardly think so, this is England.

01:29:02.085 --> 01:29:05.087
I have studied the terms
of the treaty most carefully,

01:29:05.339 --> 01:29:07.840
and I could not, in good conscience...

01:29:10.677 --> 01:29:15.097
They have fought too long and hard...

01:29:15.349 --> 01:29:18.476
Please! Let us through, please!

01:29:37.746 --> 01:29:40.498
What is happening?

01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:47.380
- Mr. Pollock?
- I'm sorry, sir. Are you all right?

01:29:47.631 --> 01:29:50.508
It appears that I am. What happened?

01:29:50.759 --> 01:29:53.886
I was a little late deciphering
the message. That's what.

01:29:54.137 --> 01:29:57.223
- Here. Let me help you up.
- Thank you.

01:29:58.141 --> 01:30:00.601
Mr. Pollock was brilliant.
He deserves a medal.

01:30:00.769 --> 01:30:04.021
Who is responsible for this?
Do you know?

01:30:04.272 --> 01:30:06.273
Yes, sir. Nejim Beshraavi.

01:30:06.483 --> 01:30:09.527
Beshr...
Mr. Pollock, I must speak with you.

01:30:09.778 --> 01:30:14.740
Excuse me. Excuse me. Come,
Mr. Prime Minister. The car is waiting.

01:30:14.991 --> 01:30:17.410
- I must speak with Mr. Pollock.
- There's no time.

01:30:17.661 --> 01:30:20.037
We don't know who else here
might be involved.

01:30:20.288 --> 01:30:22.790
I must speak to Mr. Pollock!

01:30:29.548 --> 01:30:31.757
Come on.

01:30:32.008 --> 01:30:35.511
They did it. After all that,
they did it. Wejust stood there.

01:30:38.014 --> 01:30:41.559
- Where are we going?
- We have to find Jena.

01:30:41.810 --> 01:30:44.562
- Did I understand you to say...
- That wasn't Jena.

01:30:44.813 --> 01:30:47.565
- It sounded like you said...
- I tell you, it wasn't!

01:30:47.816 --> 01:30:50.568
It looked very much like him,
but it wasn't Jena.

01:30:50.819 --> 01:30:52.820
It was Hassan Jena. I know him.

01:30:53.071 --> 01:30:54.822
- Oh!
- He knows me.

01:30:55.073 --> 01:30:57.533
I've spoken to him many times.
He came to Oxford.

01:30:57.784 --> 01:31:00.202
Jena's never set foot in England
before today.

01:31:00.454 --> 01:31:02.663
He wanted people to think that.
He was here.

01:31:02.914 --> 01:31:05.833
He's the one who sent me to Beshraavi
in the first place.

01:31:06.084 --> 01:31:08.711
That man? The one who was shot?

01:31:08.962 --> 01:31:10.671
Yes. Now do you believe me?

01:31:10.839 --> 01:31:14.341
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I never knew who you were.

01:31:14.593 --> 01:31:16.719
That's why he looked so frightened.

01:31:16.928 --> 01:31:18.971
Nejim hired him to impersonate Jena,

01:31:19.222 --> 01:31:22.975
only he neglected to mention that
part of hisjob was to be murdered.

01:31:23.185 --> 01:31:25.728
We have to find the real Jena. Come on.

01:31:29.733 --> 01:31:32.359
You expect me to believe that nonsense?

01:31:32.611 --> 01:31:36.197
- What proof do you have?
- He didn't recognize me.

01:31:36.364 --> 01:31:39.825
But... Wait...
Why should he recognize you?

01:31:41.953 --> 01:31:44.747
Yasmin, are you trying
to tell me something?

01:31:44.998 --> 01:31:46.624
I am a spy.

01:31:52.631 --> 01:31:55.132
Hey. Wait!

01:31:57.761 --> 01:32:01.388
- Can you prove that statement?
- Do you think we carry calling cards?

01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:05.851
- Then why didn't you tell me?
- You wouldn't have believed me.

01:32:10.982 --> 01:32:14.735
- Where are we going?
- I want to see where it happened.

01:32:14.986 --> 01:32:17.029
Where what happened?

01:32:19.533 --> 01:32:22.243
Did you record
the Prime Minister's arrival on tape?

01:32:22.410 --> 01:32:23.619
- Yes.
- Run it for me.

01:32:23.870 --> 01:32:26.038
The Prime Minister's life
may depend on it.

01:32:26.289 --> 01:32:29.917
- You're a bit late. He's been shot.
- Do as I say.

01:32:30.168 --> 01:32:32.670
- Is that tape ready to roll yet?
- It's all set.

01:32:32.921 --> 01:32:35.172
Put it up on the monitors.

01:32:38.677 --> 01:32:41.303
- Which one is that?
- The real one. it has to be.

01:32:41.555 --> 01:32:44.640
There was no way
to get to him before this.

01:32:45.809 --> 01:32:49.186
Yes, it's Jena.
Those are his favorite slippers.

01:32:50.814 --> 01:32:53.566
Can you see what's happening
inside the car?

01:32:53.817 --> 01:32:56.068
The windows are too dark.

01:32:57.279 --> 01:32:59.655
Hold that. Can you freeze it?

01:32:59.906 --> 01:33:02.032
Look, the shoes are different.

01:33:02.284 --> 01:33:06.078
He's not wearing slippers anymore.
That's where it happened. In the car.

01:33:06.329 --> 01:33:08.414
We've got to find it.

01:33:10.208 --> 01:33:12.334
She's a government spy.

01:33:16.464 --> 01:33:18.340
Look.

01:33:22.345 --> 01:33:24.096
Come on.

01:34:01.134 --> 01:34:03.135
Give me a hand, will you?

01:34:27.786 --> 01:34:29.411
You seriously think...

01:34:29.663 --> 01:34:32.539
What else would they have done?
Left him in the airport?

01:34:36.503 --> 01:34:38.128
It's the treaty, isn't it?

01:34:38.296 --> 01:34:41.298
If it had gone through,
Nejim would have been ruined.

01:34:41.508 --> 01:34:44.802
- Jena was going to sign it?
- That's why they needed a substitute.

01:34:45.053 --> 01:34:48.055
To denounce the treaty
before the assassination.

01:34:52.143 --> 01:34:54.436
I have a vivid imagination.

01:34:54.688 --> 01:34:58.941
I must say, I never saw myself
unpacking a prime minister.

01:35:06.074 --> 01:35:10.411
Our life expectancy may be nil,
but I'd like you to know this has been

01:35:10.662 --> 01:35:14.707
a very real, warm, human experience.

01:35:32.434 --> 01:35:34.184
It's uncanny.

01:35:34.436 --> 01:35:35.936
What is it? Where am...

01:35:36.479 --> 01:35:40.357
You're among friends, sir.
At least for the next 30 seconds.

01:35:40.608 --> 01:35:42.943
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

01:35:43.194 --> 01:35:46.196
- Is that you, Miss Azir?
- Let's get him out.

01:36:02.130 --> 01:36:04.214
Ploy number one.

01:36:14.976 --> 01:36:16.602
We've got him, sir.

01:36:16.770 --> 01:36:20.230
It's about time you did something right.
Well, get him out!

01:36:21.524 --> 01:36:24.902
Hey, you two! Lend a hand here. And you!

01:36:26.362 --> 01:36:28.030
Undo these chains.

01:36:55.767 --> 01:36:59.561
Put it down! Open it, Sloane.

01:37:10.698 --> 01:37:13.575
Imbecile. Must you mismanage everything?

01:38:10.633 --> 01:38:12.259
Down! Flat! Now!

01:38:20.643 --> 01:38:23.020
Come on! Run for it!

01:38:36.034 --> 01:38:37.159
Wait!

01:38:38.786 --> 01:38:42.247
- Can you ride, Mr. Prime Minister?
- You ask that of an Arab?

01:38:46.169 --> 01:38:49.922
- What do you want?
- We, er... er...

01:38:56.387 --> 01:38:58.180
You can't ride in that skirt.

01:39:00.391 --> 01:39:02.267
Hup!

01:39:03.436 --> 01:39:06.521
- Are you all right, sir?
- Yes, thank you.

01:39:16.199 --> 01:39:18.450
That way!

01:39:57.699 --> 01:39:59.574
I don't see what he can do now.

01:39:59.826 --> 01:40:01.994
He'll think of something.

01:40:04.372 --> 01:40:07.749
I knew you couldn't
keep a good man down.

01:40:20.972 --> 01:40:23.015
There!

01:40:24.267 --> 01:40:27.269
Get them, Sloane! This time get them!

01:40:46.289 --> 01:40:47.664
David!

01:40:51.794 --> 01:40:55.297
- Are you all right?
- No. I'm ashamed of myself.

01:40:55.548 --> 01:40:57.507
- I ride better than that.
- Come on!

01:41:08.269 --> 01:41:09.895
This side!

01:41:36.839 --> 01:41:39.091
Those stairs must lead somewhere.

01:41:39.342 --> 01:41:41.468
Are you sure?

01:41:41.719 --> 01:41:44.471
If they don't,
watch out for the last one.

01:42:51.664 --> 01:42:54.124
Here comes old Eagle-Eye.

01:42:54.375 --> 01:42:56.918
This is like a recurring
dream I used to have.

01:42:57.170 --> 01:43:00.005
- How did it end?
- Don't ask.

01:43:06.554 --> 01:43:07.762
Here goes.

01:43:07.889 --> 01:43:11.433
Don't, David. Please, don't.
You'll be a sitting duck.

01:43:47.303 --> 01:43:50.347
How come my recurring dream
never ended this way?

01:43:50.598 --> 01:43:52.349
I don't know. Mine always did.

01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:54.851
I guess I just travel in better dreams.

01:43:55.102 --> 01:43:59.356
Do I have your... solemn pledge
that you'll never spy again?

01:43:59.607 --> 01:44:02.234
- Only on you.
- Oh, swell.

01:44:02.485 --> 01:44:03.985
Hey!

01:44:09.951 --> 01:44:12.702
You clumsy idiot!
Oh, it's you, Mr. Pollock.

01:44:14.247 --> 01:44:17.123
Oh, hello, Fanshaw.

01:44:24.257 --> 01:44:27.092
David... you can swim, can't you?

01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:29.344
Sorry. Not a stroke.

01:44:42.024 --> 01:44:43.900
David!

01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:50.490
Here we are again,
taking a bath together.

01:44:50.741 --> 01:44:53.118
David, you lied to me!

01:44:53.286 --> 01:44:56.788
Sure. it was my turn.
