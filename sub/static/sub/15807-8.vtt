<i> ["The Ballad of Gilligan's</i>
  <i> Isle" by George Wyle]</i>

00:03.770 --> 00:06.238
¶ Just sit right back
    and you'll hear a tale ¶

00:06.307 --> 00:08.540
¶ A tale of a fateful trip ¶

00:08.609 --> 00:10.375
¶ That started
    from this tropic port ¶

00:10.443 --> 00:12.710
¶ Aboard this tiny ship ¶

00:12.779 --> 00:15.246
¶ The mate was
     a mighty sailin' man ¶

00:15.315 --> 00:17.649
¶ The Skipper brave and sure ¶

00:17.718 --> 00:20.085
¶ Five passengers
      set sail that day ¶

00:20.153 --> 00:22.187
¶ For a three hour tour ¶

00:22.256 --> 00:25.124
¶ A three hour tour ¶

00:25.192 --> 00:27.325
[thunder]

00:27.394 --> 00:29.327
¶ The weather started
     getting rough ¶

00:29.396 --> 00:31.563
¶ The tiny ship was tossed ¶

00:31.631 --> 00:34.366
¶ If not for the courage
    of the fearless crew ¶

00:34.435 --> 00:38.770
¶ The Minnow would be lost
   The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:38.839 --> 00:41.173
¶ The ship set ground
     on the shore of this ¶

00:41.241 --> 00:43.375
¶ Uncharted desert isle ¶

00:43.444 --> 00:46.010
¶ With Gilligan ¶

00:46.079 --> 00:48.280
¶ The Skipper too ¶

00:48.349 --> 00:52.784
¶ The millionaire and his wife ¶

00:52.853 --> 00:55.554
¶ The movie star ¶

00:55.623 --> 01:02.061
¶ And the rest are here
    on Gilligan's isle ¶

01:16.276 --> 01:18.043
Just a little more,
Gilligan.

01:18.111 --> 01:20.178
[huffing]

01:20.247 --> 01:21.680
Good, good.
That's fine.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.115
[panting]

01:23.184 --> 01:25.317
There, that
ought to do it.

01:25.386 --> 01:26.919
How you doin'
with the nails, Professor?

01:26.987 --> 01:28.953
We'll know in
    a few minutes, Skipper.

01:29.022 --> 01:31.957
I made this from the outcropping
of ferrous oxide I found.

01:32.026 --> 01:34.926
It looks good enough
to get rusty.

01:34.994 --> 01:36.828
How about that. It's nothing
  but the rock and a fire.

01:36.897 --> 01:38.964
And the Professor
          makes a.. Ooh! Ooh!

01:39.033 --> 01:41.366
(Ginger)
          'Gilligan?'

01:41.435 --> 01:44.202
Let me see that.
Oh, not your finger, the nail.

01:44.271 --> 01:45.838
Never mind.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.877
- It's a nail, alright.
    - Oh!

01:51.945 --> 01:53.645
Well, let's
          try it out.

01:53.714 --> 01:55.147
[upbeat music]

02:00.688 --> 02:01.953
- Ready, Gilligan?
       - Ready.

02:02.022 --> 02:03.255
- Hammer.
           - Hammer.

02:03.323 --> 02:05.123
- Nail.
            - Nail.

02:05.191 --> 02:06.991
- Plank.
            - Plank.

02:07.060 --> 02:08.460
Splinters. Ooh! Ooh!

02:08.527 --> 02:10.362
Oh, I'll take it out
            for you, Gilligan.

02:10.430 --> 02:12.430
- It's alright, Ginger.
    - I'm good at first aid.

02:12.499 --> 02:14.699
- I used to go with a doctor.
 - No kiddin'.

02:14.768 --> 02:16.735
Actually he was kind
          of a part-time doctor.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.903
He practiced medicine at night
  so he could pay his way

02:18.972 --> 02:20.305
through medical school.

02:20.374 --> 02:21.906
Oh, I got it.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.643
Folks, this is the big moment.
 Keep your fingers crossed.

02:24.712 --> 02:26.879
If this nail works,
we can leave the island.

02:34.955 --> 02:36.588
Maybe we need
a softer hammer.

02:46.266 --> 02:48.300
Oh, Skipper.

02:48.369 --> 02:51.336
You expect to get the Queen Mary
ready to sail in 6 days?

02:51.404 --> 02:52.971
We have to,
              Mr. Howell.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.139
The high tide maybe our last
   chance to get off the island.

02:55.208 --> 02:56.775
I know we'll do it.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.577
The Professor's working on
 a new formula for making nails.

02:58.646 --> 03:00.045
I told him what was
        wrong with the last one.

03:00.113 --> 03:01.313
You told him?

03:01.382 --> 03:03.782
Yeah. It broke when
             he hammered it.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.185
While the Professor
is working on the nails

03:06.253 --> 03:08.186
I thought we'd get
the boat ready for launching.

03:08.255 --> 03:09.821
Maybe, you two could
make some rope.

03:09.890 --> 03:13.291
Thurston, that sounds like fun.
We'll make ropes out of vine.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.228
Oh, good. That little old
       vine-maker, me.

03:17.063 --> 03:19.331
I do marvelous
    imitations.

03:20.767 --> 03:23.701
Gilligan, get another pole.
We can prop up this keel.

03:23.770 --> 03:26.471
- Ooh!
  - Watch your head, Skipper.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.040
Thanks, Gilligan.
You get that pole.

03:29.109 --> 03:30.742
Aye-aye, sir.

03:34.214 --> 03:37.148
- How about this one, Skipper?
- Perfect. Now, get it in here.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.418
On the double!

03:39.986 --> 03:40.986
Oh!

03:45.325 --> 03:47.626
Gilligan, will you go
     help someone else?

03:49.897 --> 03:50.929
Move!

03:54.034 --> 03:55.200
Hi. Another nail?

03:55.268 --> 03:59.103
Yes, new formula.
    Less brittle.

03:59.172 --> 04:01.640
Hope this one works.

04:10.049 --> 04:11.984
Lot less brittle, alright.

04:14.154 --> 04:16.321
Works fine if you
hold it this way.

04:18.926 --> 04:21.760
Don't feel bad.
Maybe you invented noodles.

04:23.063 --> 04:26.832
I know. Why don't I go
and help somebody else, huh?

04:34.407 --> 04:35.740
- Hi, girls.
          - Hi.

04:35.809 --> 04:37.575
Hi! How'd the Professor's
   new nail work out?

04:37.644 --> 04:39.544
You can't use it to nail
anything together.

04:39.613 --> 04:40.745
But it ought to make
a great Christmas ribbon.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.681
We'll never
      get off this island.

04:42.749 --> 04:45.584
Don't talk like that
      Mary Ann. Remember.

04:45.652 --> 04:48.586
In our darkest hour
      when all seems lost

04:48.655 --> 04:51.289
somewhere in the fearsome
   black of night.

04:51.358 --> 04:53.624
Let us search
     for that shining star

04:53.693 --> 04:56.661
which will guide us out
    of our desolation.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.463
Gee, that was
  a beautiful speech, Ginger.

04:58.532 --> 05:00.498
- It's from my movie.
     - What was the title?

05:00.567 --> 05:02.900
That was the title.

05:02.969 --> 05:05.236
Gilligan, would you get me some
more breadfruit for this batter?

05:05.305 --> 05:08.206
Oh, I'll get it. Gilligan can
   help you with the pancakes.

05:08.275 --> 05:09.641
- Pancakes?
          - Sure.

05:09.709 --> 05:11.576
I mashed up breadfruit
         and put in coconut milk

05:11.645 --> 05:13.244
and wild duck eggs.
             How does it taste?

05:13.313 --> 05:15.747
Like breadfruit, coconut milk
 and wild duck eggs.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.816
If we only had
       some maple syrup.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.551
There's lots of trees
     in the island.

05:19.619 --> 05:23.621
- Maybe one is full of syrup.
 - Good. Let's go look.

05:23.690 --> 05:26.558
- Let's try this one here, huh?
- Alright.

05:30.263 --> 05:31.129
- Mm!
        - It's no good?

05:31.198 --> 05:32.730
- Mm-mm.
            - Oh!

05:32.799 --> 05:36.301
It was so wise of you, Thurston
to insist the boat be repaired.

05:36.369 --> 05:37.836
It won't be long now
            before we're home.

05:37.904 --> 05:39.704
And not a moment too soon.
I have already missed

05:39.773 --> 05:42.073
12 board meetings of 6
of my corporations.

05:42.142 --> 05:44.609
Or is it 6 board meetings
of 12 of my corporations?

05:44.678 --> 05:46.611
Well, Thurston,
           you do have problems.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.680
It is rather difficult
being rich.

05:48.748 --> 05:51.516
If it weren't for the money,
I'd rather be poor.

05:51.585 --> 05:53.217
I must remember
to write that down.

05:53.286 --> 05:55.620
Thurston, what do you suppose
   those young people are doing?

05:56.490 --> 05:59.257
- Mm! Sour.
          - Yeah.

05:59.326 --> 06:03.028
Well, that's perfectly obvious,
Lovey, they're kissing trees.

06:03.096 --> 06:05.864
It's must be a new fad.
     Oh, the younger generation.

06:07.533 --> 06:09.567
They do seem to be
enjoying themselves.

06:09.636 --> 06:11.436
Think I'll have a go
at it myself.

06:11.504 --> 06:13.805
Oh, darling,
               you're so modern.

06:15.743 --> 06:16.841
Well?

06:16.910 --> 06:20.011
There's a lot to be said
for the old-fashioned way.

06:22.516 --> 06:24.782
- Mm! It's sweet.
       - Yeah.

06:24.851 --> 06:27.719
- Just like you, Gilligan.
   - Oh, yeah.

06:32.892 --> 06:35.393
- Yeah. Here comes the sap.
  - Oh, here, here.

06:35.462 --> 06:37.028
Here we go.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.066
How's it going,
                 Professor?

06:42.135 --> 06:46.170
Oh, oh. Well, I'll have to,
  I'll have to wait till it..

06:46.239 --> 06:47.873
...cools before
        I try it.

06:47.941 --> 06:50.442
I think it's amazing how you do
all those experiments

06:50.510 --> 06:52.644
with such
                    shaky hands.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.846
Well, they weren't shaky
until a second ago.

06:54.915 --> 06:58.149
Oh! Maybe it's the heat
         or something.

06:58.218 --> 07:00.218
Yeah.

07:00.287 --> 07:01.352
Skipper!

07:01.421 --> 07:03.355
Skipper,
this nail's ready.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.657
Good. Bring it over.
            We'll try it out.

07:15.168 --> 07:15.967
[explodes]

07:18.171 --> 07:21.473
Well...at least we have a nail
 for the 4th of July.

07:23.043 --> 07:25.576
Two days left to float her
      and I still haven't got

07:25.645 --> 07:26.911
the right formula.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.747
Professor, I guess
              we're licked.

07:28.815 --> 07:31.649
We'll need a miracle now
to get off this island.

07:31.718 --> 07:32.984
[indistinct chatter]

07:33.052 --> 07:35.820
- Hope you're all hungry.
   - Lunch time!

07:35.889 --> 07:38.857
- Oh, look.
- Well, look at this, pancakes.

07:38.925 --> 07:40.691
- Isn't that wonderful?
  - You're wonderful, ladies.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.894
And Gilligan made
               the syrup, too.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.729
- Gilligan made it?
    - Where did you get it?

07:44.798 --> 07:47.398
- From a tree.
      - Does it look good?

07:47.467 --> 07:49.734
[indistinct chatter]

07:49.803 --> 07:52.737
Well, ladies, here's
     to a new taste treat.

07:55.074 --> 07:56.574
[chuckles]

07:56.643 --> 07:58.577
[chuckles]
          Oh, Skipper.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.111
[chuckles]

08:04.151 --> 08:07.586
That's something I like,
syrup with a lot of body to it.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.125
What are these?
      Pancakes or yo-yos?

08:14.194 --> 08:16.394
I can't cut this.

08:16.463 --> 08:18.797
Yes, they seem to be
            sticking a bit.

08:24.471 --> 08:27.605
Gilligan, where did you
       get this, this substance?

08:27.674 --> 08:29.574
From a tree.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.175
Well, it's something
      like maple syrup.

08:31.244 --> 08:34.078
I have seen brand new girdles
that weren't as snappy as this.

08:34.147 --> 08:36.948
It's getting to be like glue.
 Even worse.

08:37.017 --> 08:40.251
Yes, it certainly is.
   It's setting like cement.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.587
Sure is, look.

08:43.390 --> 08:45.089
Wait.

08:45.158 --> 08:47.492
I just wonder.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.561
Come on, follow me.

08:51.932 --> 08:55.433
Really, Thurston,
such manners, eat and run.

08:55.502 --> 08:56.868
Positively vulgar.

08:58.671 --> 09:01.105
It works.

09:01.174 --> 09:04.475
It works. It works.
      It's waterproof.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.277
I think the Professor's
flipped his lid.

09:06.346 --> 09:09.647
- Are you alright, Professor?
 - I'm fine. We're saved.

09:09.716 --> 09:12.617
We better get in there
before he hurts himself.

09:12.686 --> 09:15.820
[clamoring]

09:15.888 --> 09:18.022
Gilligan, Gilligan, is there
anymore of this material around?

09:18.091 --> 09:20.058
Yeah, trunks full.
       I mean, tree trunks full.

09:20.126 --> 09:22.093
You found the miracle we've been
looking for, Gilligan.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.095
- You mean the syrup?
     - Exactly.

09:24.163 --> 09:26.164
It must be a combination
  of rubber, chicle and resin

09:26.232 --> 09:27.798
that bonded together
      when you heated it.

09:27.867 --> 09:30.067
It's a perfect cement
    for repairing the boat.

09:30.136 --> 09:32.703
We can patch up the Minnow
and catch that high tide.

09:32.772 --> 09:34.339
Thanks to Gilligan's glue.

09:34.408 --> 09:37.709
Right. It's permanent, it's
 waterproof and it's powerful.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.344
And it tastes good
             on pancakes, too.

09:39.413 --> 09:40.712
[all laugh]

09:42.048 --> 09:44.249
Hey, how's it comin'?
     Think it'll be ready?

09:44.317 --> 09:45.816
- Just a moment, Gilligan.
   - Do you think it'll work?

09:45.885 --> 09:49.020
It'll be ready. Will you
stand back, thank you.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.590
[chuckling]
        Well, here goes.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.531
We better let it set
  for a few minutes, Skipper.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.232
I'm glad I did something
    right for a change.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.534
Gilligan, you deserve
     a reward for this.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.136
Here, better keep this.

10:05.204 --> 10:06.938
The Smithsonian
    Institute may want it.

10:07.007 --> 10:10.508
Well, golly thanks folks. This
is the happiest day of my life.

10:10.576 --> 10:11.943
I don't deserve
        all that credit.

10:12.011 --> 10:13.711
And I wanna thank those who
  really helped me.

10:13.780 --> 10:16.815
Skipper, Professor, Ginger.

10:16.883 --> 10:20.151
But most of all I'd like to
thank Mary Ann and her pancakes.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.620
Gee Gilligan, you make me
   homesick for Hollywood

10:22.688 --> 10:24.122
and the Oscar awards.

10:24.191 --> 10:27.158
- The patch ought to be ready.
 - Let's find out.

10:28.995 --> 10:31.929
It's permanent!
           Absolutely permanent!

10:31.998 --> 10:33.932
Girls, start packing
the provisions.

10:34.001 --> 10:36.234
Tomorrow at high tide,
we shove off for home.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.369
- Oh, hurry, let's go pack.
   - Wait, here I come.

10:38.438 --> 10:40.038
Skipper, be right back.

10:45.712 --> 10:47.812
- Skipper?
        - Yes, Gilligan.

10:47.880 --> 10:50.782
Well, sir, well,
uh, I was wondering..

10:50.850 --> 10:52.884
- Would you do me a favor?
   - What is it?

10:52.952 --> 10:57.155
- Well, I, well, I-I..
     - Go on.

10:57.223 --> 10:59.189
Can I help too, sir?

10:59.258 --> 11:01.659
Why, certainly you can help,
    little buddy.

11:01.728 --> 11:02.927
You're my crew,
                 aren't you?

11:02.996 --> 11:05.063
Yes, sir! Your whole crew,
sir. Yes, sir.

11:05.132 --> 11:07.098
We're gonna need
       new brushes for the glue.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.400
Why don't you go and
           get some palm leaves?

11:09.469 --> 11:11.102
- Aye aye, sir.
        - Ha ha ha.

11:48.774 --> 11:50.175
Gilligan?

11:54.714 --> 11:56.213
What are you hiding?

11:56.282 --> 12:00.852
Me? Hiding? Where? What, what
hiding? Who? What, what hiding?

12:00.921 --> 12:04.222
Skipper, I got a confession
to make. I got a stuck foot.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.125
I thought so.

12:08.194 --> 12:09.994
Please help me,
huh, Skipper?

12:10.063 --> 12:13.064
Yes, Gilligan, I'll help you.
   But, remember.

12:13.132 --> 12:16.468
When you've done something
    wrong, don't try to hide it.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.269
I'll remember.

12:25.011 --> 12:26.878
Well, Gilligan, you've got
      to help, too.

12:26.946 --> 12:28.079
Put your hand
                 on my shoulder.

12:28.148 --> 12:31.783
- But..
- Put your hand on my shoulder!

12:36.289 --> 12:39.257
Did you have glue
               on your hand?

12:51.671 --> 12:56.274
- On the sleeve, too.
     - On the sleeve, too.

12:56.342 --> 12:59.276
That glue went right
            through my shirt!

12:59.345 --> 13:03.948
Alright, come on
            Gilligan! Heave, ho!

13:04.016 --> 13:06.651
- Heave, ho!
          - Heave, ho!

13:06.719 --> 13:08.553
- Heave ho-o-o!
        - Heave ho-o-o!

13:11.324 --> 13:13.825
Oh! Gilligan.

13:18.264 --> 13:22.967
You're getting it on my back.
 But that's alright, thank you.

13:23.036 --> 13:25.836
- That's very nice of you.
   - You're welcome.

13:25.905 --> 13:28.406
Let's try
                   and get up.

13:28.474 --> 13:29.440
Together!

13:37.317 --> 13:39.550
- What are you doing?
     - Gotta get my shoe.

13:39.619 --> 13:40.751
Never mind that!

13:40.820 --> 13:43.821
You're right, I don't
need my shoe.

13:43.890 --> 13:45.323
Where are you going now?

13:45.392 --> 13:47.058
I'm gonna get the palm leaves
   like you told me.

13:47.127 --> 13:49.861
Gilligan, would you
get back here?

13:57.236 --> 13:59.637
Well, at least
I'm closer to my shoe.

13:59.705 --> 14:01.806
Gilligan!

14:01.875 --> 14:04.375
We have got to be
               calm and logical.

14:04.444 --> 14:07.345
- Now, let's think.
      - Right. Think.

14:15.922 --> 14:19.223
I've got it.
       What we need is leverage.

14:19.292 --> 14:22.393
Yeah. Why don't you
grab the rail and push.

14:22.461 --> 14:24.329
Good idea, Gilligan.

14:42.015 --> 14:45.049
Lovey, I wonder where
everyone is.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.618
Oh, there's the Captain
         and Gilligan.

14:48.722 --> 14:50.154
Arrgh!

14:50.223 --> 14:52.189
(Gilligan)
     'Mr. and Mrs. Howell?'

14:52.258 --> 14:54.325
Look, Thurston,
       they're playing charades.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.995
You're so right, Lovey.
Oh, I must say, this is fun.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.896
Now, fellas,
            don't-don't tell me.

14:58.965 --> 15:00.431
You're Egyptian
             pictures on a tomb.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.600
- No! We're stuck!
- No! We're stuck, we're stuck!

15:02.669 --> 15:05.269
No, no! Alright,
     you're Mount Rushmore.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.738
Ah-ah, President, President!

15:07.807 --> 15:10.341
[clamoring]

15:13.312 --> 15:17.081
I see, yes, Lovey. They're
      trying to give me a clue.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.850
I think they said glue,
Thurston.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.784
I believe
                  they're stuck!

15:20.853 --> 15:23.387
(Thurston)
 'Good heavens you're right.
 They are stuck there by gum.'

15:23.456 --> 15:25.990
Stuck by gum.
Did you hear that, Lovey?

15:26.059 --> 15:27.358
Oh, you're so witty, darling!

15:27.427 --> 15:29.460
Mr. Howell, will you
            please listen?

15:29.529 --> 15:31.829
Will you do something
          to get us off of here?

15:31.898 --> 15:33.297
Call the Professor!

15:33.366 --> 15:35.366
Call somebody but get
      something to help us with!

15:35.434 --> 15:38.068
- Yes, yes, of course.
- Yes, we'll get the Professor.

15:38.137 --> 15:40.204
Don't go away.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.874
We hate to drop in without
an invitation, Professor

15:43.943 --> 15:45.576
but this is terribly important.

15:45.645 --> 15:47.644
It's about the Skipper and
  Gilligan, the most fantastic

15:47.713 --> 15:48.679
thing has happened.

15:48.748 --> 15:49.913
What's happened?

15:49.982 --> 15:51.448
They're at the beach.
           On the boat.

15:51.517 --> 15:53.517
On the boat? What's so
          fantastic about that?

15:53.586 --> 15:56.086
Well you don't understand,
   they're <i> on</i> the boat.

15:56.155 --> 15:58.422
They're against the boat.

15:58.491 --> 16:02.192
They're attached to the boat,
 they're even mounted there.

16:02.261 --> 16:04.595
Ah, like the moose heads,
in Thurston's trophy room.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.363
You've got to do something
      to get them off.

16:06.432 --> 16:08.498
You see, they're <i> pasted</i>
on the boat!

16:08.567 --> 16:11.803
Oh! Well, that glue
      is permanent.

16:11.871 --> 16:13.804
There's nothing on the island
 to dissolve it.

16:13.873 --> 16:15.005
- Nothing?
           - Nothing?

16:15.074 --> 16:16.507
Do you know
      what it would take?

16:16.576 --> 16:18.909
It would take a polyester
   derivative of an organic

16:18.978 --> 16:20.344
hydroxide molecule!

16:20.412 --> 16:23.447
Watch your language!
      In the presence of a lady!

16:23.516 --> 16:25.883
Forgive me. But,
    let me put it this way.

16:25.951 --> 16:29.187
In order to dissolve that glue,
I need an aromatic acetate.

16:30.423 --> 16:31.455
[sniffing]

16:31.524 --> 16:34.659
Wait a minute.
         Wait a minute, perfume!

16:34.727 --> 16:36.160
Some perfumes are made
          with that formula.

16:36.229 --> 16:38.496
[gasps]
I have perfume, Professor.

16:38.564 --> 16:41.599
Yes, so you do.
  I'll go check the other girls.

16:42.735 --> 16:45.003
- Now, let me see.
    - Lovey, here's a nice--

16:45.071 --> 16:48.071
Oh, Thurston.
      That's an evening perfume.

16:48.140 --> 16:50.374
You can't use that
        until the sun goes down.

16:50.443 --> 16:52.276
Oh, of course.
What am I thinking about?

16:52.345 --> 16:53.677
Oh, Lovey, here's
a full one..

16:53.746 --> 16:56.714
No, no, you men.
       That's an indoor perfume.

16:56.783 --> 16:59.383
Gilligan and the skipper
   are definitely outdoor types.

16:59.452 --> 17:02.786
Ah. This, this is
             a lovely fragrance.

17:02.855 --> 17:06.656
Not too heavy, not too light,
   and just a hint of spice.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.959
Darling, we're in a hurry.
how 'bout this one here with..

17:09.028 --> 17:10.828
Oh, Thurston.

17:10.896 --> 17:13.597
That's the one I used
    to get you to propose to me.

17:13.665 --> 17:16.000
- Uh, that's what did it?
   - Mm-hmm.

17:16.069 --> 17:18.336
Oh, by all means,
we couldn't use that one.

17:18.405 --> 17:21.204
I-I'd feel silly proposing
to that old boat.

17:23.710 --> 17:27.176
- Ginger?
     - In here, Professor.

17:27.246 --> 17:29.680
Remember this dress?
            I made it from..

17:29.749 --> 17:31.416
Ginger, I've got to
sniff your perfume.

17:31.484 --> 17:33.784
Oh, Professor.
       On the day we're leaving?

17:33.853 --> 17:35.353
Have you got any more of this?

17:35.422 --> 17:36.920
Professor, I think
              you've had enough.

17:36.989 --> 17:40.190
I haven't got time to explain.
Where do you keep your perfume?

17:40.259 --> 17:41.525
Behind my ears,
                 can't you tell?

17:41.594 --> 17:44.061
No, no, where do you
keep the bottle?

17:44.130 --> 17:46.564
Why, in my make-up case.

17:48.934 --> 17:52.303
That sales girl was wrong. That
 perfume doesn't make men wild.

17:52.372 --> 17:54.472
It drives them
       absolutely batty!

18:00.579 --> 18:01.579
Skipper?

18:01.648 --> 18:04.448
Go away Gilligan.

18:04.517 --> 18:07.518
Don't bother me now.
I'm re-gluing the entire boat

18:07.587 --> 18:09.520
board by board.

18:13.526 --> 18:15.927
Gilligan!

18:15.995 --> 18:18.429
Don't you realize that if
    the Professor hadn't thought

18:18.497 --> 18:20.731
of using Mrs. Howell's
   perfume to dissolve this glue

18:20.800 --> 18:22.567
you'd still have us
             stuck to the boat.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.101
You still smell
pretty, Skipper.

18:24.170 --> 18:26.437
- You..
   - Skipper, can I help? Huh?

18:26.505 --> 18:27.805
- Alright, you can help.
  - I'll do any thing you say.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.206
- Alright, Gilligan.
     - I'll glue and paint.

18:29.275 --> 18:30.841
[clamoring]

18:30.910 --> 18:33.044
Gilligan, cut that out.
         You can help.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.613
- Thank you, I appreciate it.
 - I said you can help.

18:35.681 --> 18:37.348
I want you to go
         to the top of that hill

18:37.416 --> 18:38.983
and keep a sharp lookout
        for icebergs.

18:39.051 --> 18:41.919
Aye, aye, aye, icebergs?
Skipper, we're in the tropics.

18:41.987 --> 18:46.290
I know, that's why they're
    hard to find. Now run along.

18:46.359 --> 18:48.325
I don't know, Skipper.
I think if I go to the top--

18:48.394 --> 18:51.896
Gilligan, if you open
          your mouth once more..

18:51.965 --> 18:53.498
Anything to say?

18:53.566 --> 18:55.933
Run along.

18:56.002 --> 18:57.368
Icebergs?

19:03.509 --> 19:05.176
[instrumental music]

19:16.622 --> 19:18.689
Hey, what are you doing here?

19:18.757 --> 19:20.691
If I were you, I'd stay
    away from me.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.294
I'm nothing but trouble.
   I try real hard and I want

19:23.363 --> 19:25.897
to help, but somehow something
 always goes wrong.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.567
Except yesterday.
       When I discovered

19:29.636 --> 19:32.370
Gilligan's waterproof glue.

19:32.438 --> 19:35.907
It sticks the pancake to the
plate with a grip of steel. See?

19:39.578 --> 19:41.646
What happened to
       the grip of steel?

19:45.418 --> 19:48.853
Oh my gosh. Gilligan's
  waterproof glue is permanent

19:48.921 --> 19:51.355
but only temporarily.

19:51.424 --> 19:53.957
And that means when the boat
  is way out at sea..

19:54.026 --> 19:56.660
Oh!

19:56.729 --> 19:58.863
Oh! Bye!

20:05.772 --> 20:09.573
Wait. Wait. Wait!

20:09.642 --> 20:12.910
Skipper. Be high tide
        in about a half an hour.

20:12.979 --> 20:16.580
We're ready to launch.

20:16.649 --> 20:20.518
Alright, girls, we're ready to
shove off. Mr. and Mrs. Howell.

20:20.587 --> 20:23.454
- Skipper, where's Gilligan?
 - Don't worry, he'll be here.

20:23.522 --> 20:27.391
Well, goodbye, island.
Hope to see you again sometime.

20:27.460 --> 20:30.227
What a place
                to make a movie.

20:30.296 --> 20:33.030
Don't go away,
                  I may be back.

20:33.098 --> 20:36.200
Just a moment, captain.
You can't just jump on a boat

20:36.268 --> 20:36.967
and sail away!

20:37.036 --> 20:38.436
Why not?

20:38.504 --> 20:41.038
Without a launching
   ceremony? I mean, really.

20:41.107 --> 20:42.973
He obviously isn't
Annapolis, dear.

20:43.042 --> 20:47.245
No salt with a shaker would sail
without a launching ceremony!

20:47.313 --> 20:48.845
Now, look here,
         Mr. Howell, I've take--

20:48.914 --> 20:52.450
Captain. I must warn you.
Mr. Howell can be very stubborn.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.186
Alright,
                but hurry it up.

20:55.254 --> 20:58.155
Thank you. This way
for the launching.

20:58.224 --> 20:59.824
Here we are.

20:59.892 --> 21:00.891
Ladies and gentlemen

21:00.960 --> 21:02.793
we're gathered her for this
festive occas..

21:02.862 --> 21:04.996
Good heavens,
where's the champagne?

21:05.064 --> 21:06.063
Champagne?

21:06.131 --> 21:08.031
Domestic will do
for a launching.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.834
- Please, we're gonna miss..
  - 'Skipper! Skipper!'

21:09.902 --> 21:11.435
- Not now, Gilligan.
   - No, but, Skipper, but..

21:11.504 --> 21:13.938
Not now, Gilligan, we're
    having a launching ceremony.

21:14.006 --> 21:15.239
Professor, Mary Ann, Ginger
  somebody listen--

21:15.307 --> 21:16.874
- Later.
    - The boat's gonna sink.

21:16.942 --> 21:19.543
- Irresponsible rumor.
 - Gilligan, will you be quiet?

21:19.612 --> 21:20.777
The glue won't hold!

21:20.846 --> 21:22.813
Come on. We're gonna
      miss the tide.

21:22.881 --> 21:24.715
Let's get down to the boat,
  so we can get on board.

21:24.783 --> 21:26.717
Stop, stop!
          Wait, wait!

21:26.786 --> 21:28.552
Skipper, can I ask
              you something?

21:28.621 --> 21:31.455
In all my life, have I ever done
anything that turned out right?

21:31.524 --> 21:33.290
- No, you haven't.
       - Then believe me.

21:33.358 --> 21:34.959
The glue,
                  it won't hold.

21:35.028 --> 21:36.694
If you launch the boat,
         it'll sink.

21:36.763 --> 21:38.963
Sink? Nonsense.

21:39.031 --> 21:41.799
Why, the old Minnow
is just as solid as a rock.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.800
[thud]

21:43.869 --> 21:49.974
See? The glue, won't last
   more than...three days!

21:51.210 --> 21:53.076
- What's happening to the boat?
- See?

21:53.145 --> 21:57.280
Get away from the boat!
 Abandon ship! Get away, folks!

21:57.349 --> 21:58.816
Gilligan, come back here!

21:58.884 --> 22:01.786
Don't worry, Skipper.
 I'll hold it together for you.

22:04.456 --> 22:05.989
- 'Skipper!'
     - Don't worry, Lovey.

22:06.058 --> 22:09.359
- 'Boat's falling apart.'
 - Get off the boat, Gilligan!

22:09.428 --> 22:11.395
[all shouting]

22:12.398 --> 22:14.231
(Ginger)
     Gilligan, look out.

22:14.300 --> 22:15.232
- Be careful.
      - Please be careful.

22:15.301 --> 22:18.102
Oh, heavens!

22:18.171 --> 22:19.603
Gilligan, get out of there.

22:19.672 --> 22:24.108
-'Get out, Gilligan.'
     - Skipper. Oh!

22:45.164 --> 22:48.365
Well, at least I saved
     the wheel, Skipper.

22:48.433 --> 22:50.401
Oh, Gilligan!

23:07.553 --> 23:09.653
- Skipper.
 - Gilligan. Sit down a minute.

23:09.721 --> 23:11.889
- But Skipper..
 - I wanna have a little talk.

23:11.957 --> 23:14.024
- Okay, Skipper.
 - Gilligan, this is important.

23:14.093 --> 23:18.862
I know that I yell at you a lot.
But it's nice to have this chat.

23:18.930 --> 23:21.265
Do you realize, if it hadn't
been for you, we might have been

23:21.333 --> 23:22.833
at sea when that
boat fell apart.

23:22.901 --> 23:25.101
- I'm glad we weren't.
- You do a lot of things wrong.

23:25.170 --> 23:27.738
But you're always trying your
best, and that's important.

23:27.807 --> 23:29.940
- Thanks, Skipper.
- I always try to remember that.

23:30.009 --> 23:31.875
Now, what is it, little buddy,
that you were trying to tell me?

23:31.944 --> 23:35.646
You're sitting on
      a paintbrush full of glue.

23:35.714 --> 23:37.047
No!

23:44.590 --> 23:46.156
Skipper, look on
                the bright side.

23:46.225 --> 23:47.624
The bright side?

23:47.693 --> 23:50.027
Nobody can ever pull
     a chair out from under you.

23:52.031 --> 23:53.864
You've done it again.

24:04.276 --> 24:06.710
¶ They're here for
       a long long time ¶

24:06.779 --> 24:09.079
¶ They'll have to make
     the best of things ¶

24:09.148 --> 24:10.780
¶ It's an uphill climb ¶

24:10.849 --> 24:12.816
¶ The first mate
     and his Skipper too ¶

24:12.885 --> 24:15.019
¶ Will do their very best ¶

24:15.087 --> 24:17.354
¶ To make the others
      comfortable ¶

24:17.423 --> 24:19.189
¶ In the tropic island nest ¶

24:19.258 --> 24:21.491
¶ No phone, no lights,
     no motor car ¶

24:21.560 --> 24:23.526
¶ Not a single luxury ¶

24:23.595 --> 24:25.862
¶ Like Robinson Crusoe ¶

24:25.931 --> 24:27.865
¶ It's primitive as can be ¶

24:27.933 --> 24:30.467
¶ So join us here
     each week my friends ¶

24:30.536 --> 24:32.603
¶ You're sure to get a smile ¶

24:32.671 --> 24:34.738
¶ From seven
      stranded castaways ¶

24:34.807 --> 24:36.874
¶ Here on Gilligan's Isle ¶

24:37.305 --> 24:43.749
