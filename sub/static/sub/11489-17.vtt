WEBVTT

00:02.360 --> 00:04.960
Darling, what's mine is yours.

00:05.130 --> 00:07.020
We do not need a preup.

00:07.030 --> 00:08.420
And I just want you to know

00:08.430 --> 00:10.390
I'm not after your father's money.

00:10.400 --> 00:11.850
I'm sure you're not.

00:11.860 --> 00:13.950
Believe me, I got
plenty of my own money.

00:13.960 --> 00:15.550
-Everything okay?
-No, no,

00:15.560 --> 00:16.850
everything is not okay.

00:16.860 --> 00:18.650
Courtney, we've been through this.

00:18.660 --> 00:20.420
What am I supposed to do,
live on the streets?

00:20.430 --> 00:22.420
You're supposed to
live within your means.

00:22.430 --> 00:24.390
I need $50,000.

00:25.730 --> 00:27.250
Charlie, what am I going to do?

00:27.260 --> 00:30.290
You're going to take the money from me.

00:30.300 --> 00:32.650
"So long as men can breathe

00:32.659 --> 00:34.020
"or eyes can see,

00:34.030 --> 00:35.220
"so long lives this

00:35.230 --> 00:37.220
and gives life"...

00:37.230 --> 00:38.530
"to thee."

00:40.200 --> 00:42.930
You may now kiss the bride.

00:51.330 --> 00:53.450
It's hard to believe
after all these years

00:53.460 --> 00:54.790
we've got a new stepdad.

00:54.800 --> 00:57.720
I give it six months.

00:57.730 --> 00:59.190
Oh, come on, we like Teddy.

00:59.200 --> 01:00.890
That's why I'm only giving it six months.

01:00.900 --> 01:02.220
I'm rooting for him.

01:02.230 --> 01:04.220
Well, still, y-you have to admit

01:04.230 --> 01:05.590
it was a beautiful ceremony

01:05.600 --> 01:07.950
the bride and the groom, the sun setting...

01:07.960 --> 01:09.700
The dead butterflies.

01:13.200 --> 01:14.850
Remind me to call the butterfly people

01:14.860 --> 01:16.900
first thing Monday.

01:19.600 --> 01:21.030
What are you doing?

01:28.660 --> 01:30.190
Nothing.

01:30.200 --> 01:33.720
We don't eat from the
cake until we cut the cake.

01:33.730 --> 01:35.120
But I'm still hungry.

01:35.130 --> 01:36.520
Have some cheese.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.330
Have we cut the cheese?

01:39.400 --> 01:41.720
Get it?

01:41.730 --> 01:43.690
Hey, stepbrother.

01:43.700 --> 01:45.850
Change your mind about
wanting to marry me?

01:45.860 --> 01:47.520
Not at all.

01:47.530 --> 01:50.550
Want to go upstairs and get a
head start on our honeymoon?

01:50.560 --> 01:51.950
You keep rubbing up against me,

01:51.960 --> 01:54.660
I'll be able to catch my mom's
garter without my hands.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.890
Charlie.

01:59.900 --> 02:01.050
What?

02:01.060 --> 02:02.450
At your mother's wedding?

02:02.460 --> 02:04.400
Yeah.

02:05.260 --> 02:08.020
I couldn't have.

02:10.300 --> 02:12.550
Boy, this is pretty kinky.

02:12.560 --> 02:13.950
Kinky good or kinky bad?

02:13.960 --> 02:15.050
There's a kinky bad?

02:15.060 --> 02:16.050
Oh!

02:16.060 --> 02:18.490
Oh, watch your elbow.

02:18.500 --> 02:19.990
That's not my elbow.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.390
Oh, Charlie.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.730
It's not that either.

02:26.730 --> 02:28.720
Daddy?

02:28.730 --> 02:30.720
Ooh, this is awkward.

02:30.730 --> 02:33.550
Daddy, are you okay?

02:33.560 --> 02:34.820
What's wrong with him?

02:34.830 --> 02:37.330
I don't know.

02:38.530 --> 02:40.020
Well?

02:40.030 --> 02:42.700
This might be a mood breaker.

02:59.160 --> 03:01.520
So are you a friend of
the bride or the groom?

03:01.530 --> 03:06.250
Uh, well, the bride is my
mother, so... the groom.

03:06.260 --> 03:07.820
Hey, how do you like my house?

03:07.830 --> 03:09.860
Oh, it's beautiful.

03:10.760 --> 03:12.790
Alan, I have to talk to you.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.150
Go away, I've a shot here.

03:14.160 --> 03:16.620
No, you don't.

03:16.630 --> 03:17.790
Come upstairs with me.

03:17.800 --> 03:19.960
Why? Just come on.

03:21.800 --> 03:24.020
Friend of the bride or
friend of the groom?

03:24.030 --> 03:26.260
Friend of mine.

03:32.330 --> 03:35.350
Oh, my God.

03:35.360 --> 03:36.650
Is he...?

03:36.660 --> 03:39.250
As a doorknob.

03:39.260 --> 03:40.920
Doorbell?

03:40.930 --> 03:41.950
Doornail.

03:41.960 --> 03:44.090
He's dead.

03:45.160 --> 03:46.690
I can't believe he's gone.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.630
Courtney, I-I'm so sorry.

03:49.460 --> 03:51.520
So he was just lying there

03:51.530 --> 03:52.690
with his pants down?

03:52.700 --> 03:54.790
Apparently, somebody was giving him

03:54.800 --> 03:57.290
a very special wedding present.

03:57.300 --> 03:58.920
Mom?

03:58.930 --> 04:00.220
I don't think so.

04:00.230 --> 04:02.520
She's downstairs acting
as if nothing happened,

04:02.530 --> 04:04.190
and more importantly, she
already married the guy.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.920
Why would she bother?

04:07.160 --> 04:10.530
Your mother's looking for you guys.

04:13.260 --> 04:14.590
What's going on?

04:14.600 --> 04:16.500
Teddy's dead.

04:19.899 --> 04:22.430
Yeah, that's a stiffy.

04:23.260 --> 04:25.850
We've got a real problem here.

04:25.860 --> 04:27.700
What do you mean "we"?

04:34.230 --> 04:37.290
Someday he'll come along

04:37.300 --> 04:39.950
The man I love

04:39.960 --> 04:43.090
And he'll be big and strong

04:43.100 --> 04:46.220
The man I love

04:46.230 --> 04:49.250
And when he comes my way

04:49.260 --> 04:51.520
I'll do my best

04:51.530 --> 04:55.050
To make him

04:55.060 --> 04:57.360
Stay

04:58.800 --> 05:01.490
Oh, this is just going to suck.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.790
The man

05:03.800 --> 05:06.750
I love

05:09.100 --> 05:10.520
Thank you, thank you.

05:10.530 --> 05:13.190
Now, this next song you may remember

05:13.200 --> 05:16.260
from the hit movie Ghost.

05:17.100 --> 05:21.350
Oh, my love

05:21.360 --> 05:22.520
My darling

05:22.530 --> 05:23.590
Mom.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.750
I've hungered for your touch

05:25.760 --> 05:27.190
Mom we got to talk to you.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.790
A long...
What?

05:28.800 --> 05:30.300
Lonely time

05:31.130 --> 05:33.090
It's about Teddy.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.120
Where is he?

05:34.130 --> 05:36.220
This is supposed to be a duet.

05:36.230 --> 05:40.450
Time goes by so slowly

05:40.460 --> 05:42.090
Yeah, well, from now on

05:42.100 --> 05:44.260
I'm afraid you're going
to be working alone.

05:45.460 --> 05:49.920
You son of a bitch.

05:49.930 --> 05:52.920
So you weren't the one who was...?

05:52.930 --> 05:53.990
Of course not.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.800
I already married the man.

05:58.560 --> 06:01.090
I just can't believe

06:01.100 --> 06:04.720
he'd cheat on me on our wedding day.

06:04.730 --> 06:08.090
Excuse me. My father
is lying here dead.

06:08.100 --> 06:10.020
With his pants around his ankles

06:10.030 --> 06:11.790
and lipstick on his hoo-hoo.

06:11.800 --> 06:15.900
Oh, my, what happened in here?

06:17.700 --> 06:20.850
Berta, my husband is dead.

06:20.860 --> 06:23.900
As a doornail.

06:26.060 --> 06:27.890
Has anybody called the cops?

06:27.900 --> 06:30.020
Well, you might want to consider it

06:30.030 --> 06:31.750
because you only got a limited window

06:31.760 --> 06:34.100
before he starts stinking up the joint.

06:35.430 --> 06:36.750
I'll make the calls.

06:36.760 --> 06:38.050
Oh, no, Mom, you don't have to.

06:38.060 --> 06:39.050
Yes, I do.

06:39.060 --> 06:40.820
I'm his wife.

06:40.830 --> 06:42.150
Now, please,

06:42.160 --> 06:45.650
would you all just give me
a moment alone with him?

06:45.660 --> 06:47.990
Of course. Sure, Mom.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.350
So who do you suppose was
smoking Teddy's sausage?

06:51.360 --> 06:52.350
Berta,

06:52.360 --> 06:54.020
that is my father in there.

06:54.030 --> 06:55.650
Okay.

06:55.660 --> 06:58.500
So who do you suppose was
smoking your father's sausage?

06:59.300 --> 07:01.650
Oh, Teddy.

07:01.660 --> 07:04.520
My dear, dear Teddy.

07:11.360 --> 07:14.020
Hello.

07:14.030 --> 07:17.850
This is Evelyn Harper Leopold.

07:17.860 --> 07:21.220
I booked my honeymoon with you.

07:21.230 --> 07:23.050
Yes.

07:23.060 --> 07:27.750
Two business-class tickets to Paris.

07:27.760 --> 07:32.660
I need to exchange them for
one first-class ticket to Fiji.

07:33.500 --> 07:36.990
Sure, I'll hold.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.620
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a crime scene,

07:38.630 --> 07:39.620
so you're just going

07:39.630 --> 07:40.750
to have to be patient.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.020
We'll need statements from each of you

07:42.030 --> 07:45.690
before you can leave.

07:45.700 --> 07:47.350
Anyway, I-I guess what I'm saying is

07:47.360 --> 07:49.750
that there's a lesson to be learned here.

07:49.760 --> 07:50.060
Life is precious

07:51.030 --> 07:53.430
and no one really knows how long we've got...

07:54.600 --> 07:57.620
...so it's important to be greatful each day.

07:57.630 --> 08:01.490
So if they're not going to cut
the cake, can I have some now?

08:01.500 --> 08:03.360
Aren't you full?

08:11.730 --> 08:14.650
No.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.830
Take a look at his pants.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.520
The belt is buckled on an unworn hole.

08:22.530 --> 08:23.990
Someone re-dressed him.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.330
Any of you touch the body?

08:28.830 --> 08:30.820
Interesting.

08:30.830 --> 08:32.450
We've got some perimortem ecchymosis

08:32.460 --> 08:34.820
on the posterior occiput.

08:34.830 --> 08:39.020
That means a bruise on the back of the head.

08:39.030 --> 08:42.159
And yet you still couldn't
get in medical school.

08:42.960 --> 08:45.490
So much for time of death.

08:45.500 --> 08:47.550
Looks like our boy here
had some sexual activity

08:47.560 --> 08:48.890
before he bought it.

08:48.900 --> 08:50.390
Hit the light.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.400
I'm going to check for semen.

08:54.230 --> 08:57.130
Uh-oh.

08:58.960 --> 09:01.490
My God.

09:01.500 --> 09:04.560
It's like a Jackson Pollock painting.

09:07.600 --> 09:11.260
The ceiling fan is actually a cute story.

09:14.130 --> 09:15.120
Coffee

09:15.130 --> 09:16.920
Thanks.

09:16.930 --> 09:18.390
So, Mr. Harper...

09:18.400 --> 09:19.720
Call me Charlie.

09:19.730 --> 09:21.250
And you are?

09:21.260 --> 09:23.120
Interested in how you found the body.

09:23.130 --> 09:26.490
Oh, right to it, huh?

09:26.500 --> 09:29.290
Okay, well...

09:29.300 --> 09:31.300
what have you heard?

09:32.130 --> 09:34.290
That's not how we do this.

09:34.300 --> 09:36.720
You tell me what happened.

09:36.730 --> 09:38.990
All right.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.730
I went upstairs to use the
bathroom and there he was.

09:47.660 --> 09:50.520
Oh, no.

09:50.530 --> 09:53.450
Teddy.

09:53.460 --> 09:56.650
So you're saying you were
alone when you found him?

09:56.660 --> 09:59.800
Well, technically
aren't we all alone?

10:01.660 --> 10:05.000
You know, I'm finding that tank
top awfully distracting.

10:11.660 --> 10:14.000
Is that police-issue?

10:19.300 --> 10:21.020
Mr. Harper, are you aware

10:21.030 --> 10:23.790
that making a false statement
to the police is a crime?

10:25.630 --> 10:27.120
Slap-on-the-wrist crime

10:27.130 --> 10:30.220
or pack-my-bags-and-tape-my-butt-shut crime?

10:32.930 --> 10:36.590
Hey, I like it when it's gift-wrapped.

10:39.760 --> 10:42.190
Okay, okay, I wasn't alone.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.320
I was with Courtney.

10:43.330 --> 10:45.250
Why'd you lie?
Oh, come on.

10:45.260 --> 10:46.320
I was trying to nail my stepsister

10:46.330 --> 10:47.700
at my mother's wedding.

10:48.700 --> 10:51.890
Lying seemed the classyay to go.

10:51.900 --> 10:54.590
Did you touch the body?

10:54.600 --> 10:57.000
I was all over her body.

10:58.830 --> 11:01.220
Oh, you mean Teddy?

11:01.230 --> 11:03.890
No, no, no, not after I
knew he was there.

11:03.900 --> 11:06.150
Who do you suppose pulled up his pants?

11:06.160 --> 11:08.450
Are you thinking

11:08.460 --> 11:10.650
whoever pulled 'em up is the one who killed him?

11:10.660 --> 11:12.120
It's crossed our minds.

11:12.130 --> 11:15.350
Oh, gee, I don't want to implicate anybody.

11:15.360 --> 11:17.520
Right now, the only one impliced is you.

11:17.530 --> 11:19.750
Talk to my mother.

11:21.430 --> 11:22.820
What is that, non-dairy creamer?

11:22.830 --> 11:25.290
Just take me to the green
mile and be done with it.

11:25.300 --> 11:28.590
That's all we've got.

11:28.600 --> 11:29.750
Oh, please.

11:29.760 --> 11:31.190
This place is crawling with cops.

11:31.200 --> 11:32.960
One of them can't make a Starbucks run?

11:33.800 --> 11:35.450
Mrs. Harper...

11:35.460 --> 11:37.350
Mrs. Leopold.

11:37.360 --> 11:39.350
Mrs. Leopold.

11:39.360 --> 11:42.050
Did you touch your husband's
body before the police arrived?

11:42.060 --> 11:44.950
All right, yes,I pulled up his pants up.

11:44.960 --> 11:47.620
Why?
Because it was embarrassing.

11:47.630 --> 11:51.120
There was lipstick on his hoo-hoo.

11:51.130 --> 11:52.320
Your lipstick?

11:52.330 --> 11:55.160
Oh, God, no, I'd rather drink your coffee.

11:56.830 --> 11:58.950
So he was with another woman?

11:58.960 --> 12:00.950
Not necessarily.

12:00.960 --> 12:03.690
Do you have another theory for
where the pstick came from?

12:03.700 --> 12:07.260
Have you ruled out clowns?

12:11.830 --> 12:14.090
You should check

12:14.100 --> 12:16.560
for really big footprints.

12:19.830 --> 12:22.390
Okay, he was with another woman.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.490
I imagine that made you pretty angry.

12:24.500 --> 12:26.960
I don't get angry. I get even.

12:29.930 --> 12:31.920
I mean,what are you insinuating?

12:31.930 --> 12:35.260
I'm insinuating that maybe
you caught him in the act.

12:39.730 --> 12:41.390
Evie.

12:41.400 --> 12:43.720
You cheating bastard!

12:43.730 --> 12:44.990
Evie...

12:45.000 --> 12:46.330
I can explain.

12:48.160 --> 12:50.150
Evie, I can explain.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.560
I can explain...

13:01.000 --> 13:04.930
And Paris for two becomes Fiji for one.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.390
We checked your phone records.

13:07.400 --> 13:09.390
Listen, let me tell you something.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.890
I loved that man and he loved me.

13:11.900 --> 13:14.890
In, fact, he loved me so much
he didn't even ask for a prenup.

13:14.900 --> 13:16.450
And believe me, he's got money.

13:16.460 --> 13:17.920
Big money.

13:17.930 --> 13:20.590
Well, we don't have to look very hard

13:20.600 --> 13:22.460
to find a motive for you, do we?

13:28.700 --> 13:30.720
I'm warning you,

13:30.730 --> 13:33.590
这里的咖啡就快把我弄死了
coffee tends to shoot through me.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.590
So, if you've got a cavity search planned,

13:35.600 --> 13:37.800
you better do it pretty quick.

13:39.700 --> 13:42.090
We don't need to do a cavity search.

13:42.100 --> 13:44.300
Can I request one?

13:47.160 --> 13:49.320
What do you know about Teddy Leopold?

13:49.330 --> 13:52.050
I know he was hot for me.

13:52.060 --> 13:54.090
He was always irting.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.750
This is my mom's boyfriend, Teddy.

13:55.760 --> 13:57.290
Tey, my housekeeper, Berta.

13:57.300 --> 13:58.520
A pleasure.

13:58.530 --> 14:01.460
It could be if you play your cards right.

14:07.060 --> 14:08.650
Whoa.

14:08.660 --> 14:10.320
You can't blame him.

14:10.330 --> 14:12.150
EvelynYou gotta figure that boinking Evelyn

14:12.160 --> 14:14.500
is like riding a bicycle over train tracks.

14:15.460 --> 14:17.450
You'll get where you're going

14:17.460 --> 14:19.660
but you're gonna feel every bump.

14:24.000 --> 14:24.990
How's the hot chocolate?

14:25.000 --> 14:26.150
It's good.

14:26.160 --> 14:27.650
I like the powdered stuff

14:27.660 --> 14:28.690
'cause there's always a little
something to chew on

14:28.700 --> 14:29.730
when you get to the bottom.

14:36.700 --> 14:38.690
Got any donuts?
Nope.

14:38.700 --> 14:39.920
nish?
Nope.

14:39.930 --> 14:41.190
Pie?

14:41.200 --> 14:43.350
Look, Jake,

14:43.360 --> 14:44.950
what I want to know is,

14:44.960 --> 14:46.890
were you in your uncle's
room at any time today?

14:46.900 --> 14:48.200
No, I never go in my uncle's room.

14:49.430 --> 14:51.630
Because all the skin mags
are in my dad's room.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.490
Okay, let me just start out by saying,

14:56.500 --> 14:58.650
I know about the illegal left turn ticket.

14:58.660 --> 15:01.090
And I-I've been meaning to take care of it,

15:01.100 --> 15:03.150
but, you know, business has been a little slow

15:03.160 --> 15:04.520
and those bills just keep coming.

15:04.530 --> 15:06.350
Of course I don't have to tell you that.

15:06.360 --> 15:07.990
Our law enforcement personnel
are woefully underpaid.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.960
Thanyou for the coffee, by the way.

15:12.830 --> 15:13.890
Cops and truck drivers.
You know your coffee.

15:13.900 --> 15:15.900
Am I going to jail?

15:18.060 --> 15:20.550
Tell me about you and Teddy Leopold.

15:20.560 --> 15:21.590
Oh, I loved Teddy.

15:21.600 --> 15:22.890
He was like a father to me.

15:22.900 --> 15:23.890
Is that so?

15:23.900 --> 15:25.250
Yeah, yeah.

15:25.260 --> 15:27.550
He took me to Vegas, bought me a hooker.

15:27.560 --> 15:30.390
Would any of you gentlemen like a date?

15:30.400 --> 15:32.050
Sorry, doll, I'm taken.

15:32.060 --> 15:35.220
But I wouldn't mind footing the
bill for my two boys here.

15:35.230 --> 15:36.890
Hi, I'm Amber.

15:36.900 --> 15:38.600
I'm Tiffany.

15:40.430 --> 15:43.350
Thanks, Daddy!
Thanks, Daddy!

15:43.360 --> 15:45.990
A hooker?

15:46.000 --> 15:47.950
And gelato.

15:47.960 --> 15:49.420
You got my blessing, Teddy.

15:49.430 --> 15:51.590
Shut up and eat your gelato.

15:51.600 --> 15:54.420
So you were happy he married your mother?

15:54.430 --> 15:56.090
Are you kidding?
I was thrilled.

15:56.100 --> 15:57.420
I-I planned the wedding.

15:57.430 --> 15:58.920
And it went great.

15:58.930 --> 16:01.650
The reception not so much.

16:01.660 --> 16:03.000
Why? What happened?

16:03.830 --> 16:06.430
The groom died.

16:07.760 --> 16:10.200
Remember?

16:12.530 --> 16:14.730
Do you need to write that down?

16:16.460 --> 16:18.920
Do you have any idea who
might have wanted him dead?

16:18.930 --> 16:19.950
No, no.

16:19.960 --> 16:21.290
Everybody loved Teddy.

16:21.300 --> 16:23.120
And-and he was so good to my mom.

16:23.130 --> 16:25.120
It's a shame she has to
bury another husband.

16:25.130 --> 16:26.750
Another husband?

16:26.760 --> 16:28.420
Yeah.

16:28.430 --> 16:30.920
Um, well, she's, you know,
had a bit of bad luck

16:30.930 --> 16:33.130
in the dead spouse department.

16:34.300 --> 16:35.950
Not that you can have good luck

16:35.960 --> 16:37.990
in the dead spouse department.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.020
Can I have some more coffee?

16:40.030 --> 16:41.550
Who ratted me out?

16:41.560 --> 16:42.590
Was it Alan?

16:42.600 --> 16:44.090
Oh, it doesn't matter.

16:44.100 --> 16:45.890
Either one of them would throw me under a bus

16:45.900 --> 16:47.990
for an Eskimo Pie.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.890
We just like to know about your late husbands.

16:50.900 --> 16:52.590
All right.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.590
There's not much to tell.

16:54.600 --> 16:57.120
Charlie and Alan's father died of food poisoning.

16:57.130 --> 16:58.550
Where'd he get the food?

16:58.560 --> 17:02.290
I was a young bride. I was just learning to cook.

17:02.300 --> 17:06.089
Nobody told me you don't
keep fish in a drawer.

17:06.099 --> 17:09.050
All right, what about the others?

17:09.060 --> 17:11.089
Well, the usual.

17:11.099 --> 17:13.349
Um, couple of heart attacks...

17:13.359 --> 17:15.560
a bathtub electrocution.

17:17.060 --> 17:19.089
Why are you grilling me?

17:19.099 --> 17:21.490
I'm not the one who was
fighting with him over money.

17:21.500 --> 17:22.960
Who was?

17:24.060 --> 17:25.619
I just don't understand
why you won't help me.

17:25.630 --> 17:27.020
Damn it, Courtney.
We've been through this!

17:27.030 --> 17:28.590
I'm not going to keep bailing you out.

17:28.600 --> 17:30.850
But, Daddy, I...
Don't "but Daddy" me!

17:30.860 --> 17:32.520
What am I supposed to do?
Live on the streets?

17:32.530 --> 17:34.700
You're supposed to live within your means!

17:35.530 --> 17:37.730
I want a lawyer.

17:41.460 --> 17:43.490
Tall, soy lattey, no foam.

17:43.500 --> 17:46.090
Grandmommy can't drink this cop swill anymore.

17:46.100 --> 17:48.120
Mom, they told us to wait here.

17:48.130 --> 17:49.820
Well, that's why I'm sending Jake.

17:49.830 --> 17:51.920
Think of it as job training, dear.

17:51.930 --> 17:53.920
Hi, Charlie.

17:53.930 --> 17:55.590
Hey, Charlie.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.390
Hi, Charlie.

17:57.400 --> 17:58.960
Hi, alan.

18:02.630 --> 18:04.690
Hey, I'm not the one who's got a dead husband

18:04.700 --> 18:06.700
with someone else'lipstick on his dipstick.

18:07.760 --> 18:09.720
Has anybody seen Courtney?

18:09.730 --> 18:11.490
She's talking to her attorney.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.050
Why does she need an attorney?

18:13.060 --> 18:15.220
GC mass spec analysis revealed

18:15.230 --> 18:17.220
that the lipstick pigment on the body

18:17.230 --> 18:18.850
matches the pstick she was wearing.

18:18.860 --> 18:19.920
Wait!

18:19.930 --> 18:21.520
Courtney with her own father?

18:21.530 --> 18:22.790
Not according to their DNA.

18:22.800 --> 18:23.820
They're not even related.

18:23.830 --> 18:24.920
What?!

18:24.930 --> 18:26.090
You're kidding!
That's impossible!

18:26.100 --> 18:27.220
They're con artists. Grifters.

18:27.230 --> 18:28.720
Wanted in half a dozen states.

18:28.730 --> 18:31.590
His real name is Nathan Krunk

18:31.600 --> 18:33.020
and she is Sylvia Fishman.

18:33.030 --> 18:35.690
That can't be right.

18:35.700 --> 18:37.350
I was gonna marry her.

18:37.360 --> 18:38.430
What?!
What?!

18:40.260 --> 18:44.020
We were gonna surprise you,
but I guess that ship has sailed.

18:44.030 --> 18:46.890
Well, they've got a long
record of marital fraud.

18:46.900 --> 18:49.320
They pick out marks with
more money than brains

18:49.330 --> 18:51.200
and then take 'em down the aisle.

18:52.230 --> 18:53.250
You're just gonna turn your bacon me?

18:53.260 --> 18:54.150
Your own daughter?

18:54.160 --> 18:55.550
Don't be such a drama queen!

18:55.560 --> 18:57.490
You know what?
Forget it! I'm out of here.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.150
Courtney, don't be like that!

18:59.160 --> 19:00.820
But

19:00.830 --> 19:02.320
I don't understand.

19:02.330 --> 19:03.650
Teddy didn't need money.

19:03.660 --> 19:05.420
He was a very wealthy man.

19:05.430 --> 19:09.560
And I practically had to force
Courtney to take my $50,000.

19:16.800 --> 19:19.190
But-but what about his lifestyle?

19:19.200 --> 19:21.520
The-the private jet, the trips to Vegas?

19:21.530 --> 19:23.190
Bad checks, stolen credit cards.

19:23.200 --> 19:24.820
The only reason he didn't want a prenup

19:24.830 --> 19:26.520
was so he could get a
clear shot at your money.

19:26.530 --> 19:29.750
But then why would Courtney
kill her own partner?

19:29.760 --> 19:31.020
She didn't.

19:31.030 --> 19:33.250
They were going at it hot and heavy

19:33.260 --> 19:36.420
and his heart gave out.

19:39.030 --> 19:42.230
Yeah, I can see that happening.

19:43.230 --> 19:44.990
What threw us off at first was

19:45.000 --> 19:46.850
the bruising on the back of his head.

19:46.860 --> 19:48.550
But then autopsy revealed

19:48.560 --> 19:51.350
that happened roughly 48
hours before time of death.

19:51.360 --> 19:52.590
Would still love to get together.

19:52.600 --> 19:53.790
So give me a call.

19:53.800 --> 19:55.050
I'm just sitting at home

19:55.060 --> 19:56.490
reading a book.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.290
Ow, that hurts!

19:58.300 --> 20:00.120
Want to switch?

20:00.130 --> 20:03.890
Yeah, let's try banging
your head for a while.

20:03.900 --> 20:06.550
I don't believe it.

20:06.560 --> 20:10.130
She used me. She scammed me.
She took my money.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.820
Courtney!

20:12.830 --> 20:14.250
What?

20:14.260 --> 20:16.600
I'll wait for you.

20:23.730 --> 20:25.630
Got a postcard from the black widow.

20:26.830 --> 20:28.490
No kidding.

20:28.500 --> 20:30.250
How's her honeymoon going?

20:30.260 --> 20:31.790
Pretty good, apparently.

20:31.800 --> 20:33.620
She's already met a wealthy
real estate investor.

20:33.630 --> 20:36.790
I gotta admit: the woman's got spirit.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.820
No matter what life throws at her,

20:38.830 --> 20:41.600
she always lands on her back.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.800
What's the matter?

20:56.830 --> 20:59.030
Oh, oh, Jake! Oh, God!

21:01.900 --> 21:03.550
That was a good one, wasn't it?

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
