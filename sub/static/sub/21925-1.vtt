WEBVTT

00:15.140 --> 00:17.434
They are coming.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.440
Atom by atom...

00:24.858 --> 00:27.569
they will coil around us...

00:28.987 --> 00:32.657
and take all that we are.

00:32.741 --> 00:36.786
There is one way to confront this threat.

00:38.079 --> 00:42.542
By reuniting the 24 warring houses

00:42.625 --> 00:45.253
of our own empire.

00:46.588 --> 00:50.091
We have forgotten the Unforgettable...

00:50.925 --> 00:54.095
the last to unify our tribes:

00:54.387 --> 00:56.139
Kahless.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.559
Together, under one creed...

01:00.560 --> 01:03.104
remain Klingon!

01:06.107 --> 01:12.781
That is why we light our beacon this day.

01:14.199 --> 01:19.454
To assemble our people.

01:20.038 --> 01:26.169
To lock arms against those
whose fatal greeting is...

19:39.636 --> 19:44.725
Witness our brother, our torchbearer,

19:44.808 --> 19:50.022
killed by the Federation interloper
on our sacred beacon.

19:56.820 --> 20:00.866
I see you as you see the end.

20:02.284 --> 20:06.872
Our Torchbearer honors us...

20:07.414 --> 20:14.379
first to die in our crusade
for self-preservation.

20:59.967 --> 21:06.515
Our ancestors welcome our fallen brother,
Rejac,

21:06.598 --> 21:08.642
to their Black Fleet.

21:09.309 --> 21:13.689
They fight with us,

21:13.815 --> 21:19.321
as we fight against our enemy.

21:20.404 --> 21:23.782
Remain Klingon!

26:39.266 --> 26:42.853
All is as it is meant to be.

26:44.894 --> 26:48.732
Who is Rejac's next in line?

26:52.738 --> 26:53.989
I am his brother.

26:54.072 --> 26:55.824
Or'Eq.

26:55.905 --> 26:59.993
The honor falls to you
to be our new Torchbearer.

27:00.410 --> 27:01.620
With respect...

27:03.207 --> 27:06.460
I find great wisdom in your teachings...

27:07.461 --> 27:08.295
But?

27:08.668 --> 27:12.213
Can you be sure our brothers and sisters
will answer your call?

27:12.299 --> 27:15.177
They will because the prophecy commands

27:16.178 --> 27:19.723
all Klingons must come
to the light of Kahless

27:19.804 --> 27:23.099
when it shines in the night sky.

27:23.224 --> 27:27.354
Will ships really fly across the galaxy
because of a fable?

27:27.439 --> 27:30.025
So, you doubt?

27:30.609 --> 27:33.237
You dishonor...

27:34.027 --> 27:36.571
only yourself.

27:37.906 --> 27:40.909
I will light the beacon.

27:44.373 --> 27:46.583
Speak your name.

27:47.209 --> 27:48.252
Voq.

27:49.294 --> 27:51.171
Son of none.

27:55.801 --> 27:58.011
You have no family blade of your own.

28:00.303 --> 28:04.849
You cannot assume the birthright
of a noble house.

28:06.186 --> 28:07.771
You are unworthy.

28:07.855 --> 28:09.022
I am worthy.

28:10.480 --> 28:13.066
Not by blood...

28:15.193 --> 28:17.195
but by faith.

28:22.784 --> 28:27.497
I serve the light of Kahless.

28:31.418 --> 28:34.129
I am reborn in his flames.

28:50.520 --> 28:54.107
I recognize you as one
who has lived his life on the outside

28:54.649 --> 28:59.279
and yearns to be part of something
bigger than himself.

29:05.827 --> 29:10.331
Some may see the color of your skin
as nature's mistake.

29:12.794 --> 29:15.422
I call it a mirror...

29:16.340 --> 29:19.009
for I see myself in you.

29:23.263 --> 29:24.097
My Lord!

29:25.764 --> 29:30.977
Long-range sensors show the movement,
just as you predicted.

29:31.438 --> 29:33.398
Excellent. The time has come.

29:34.191 --> 29:36.735
Take my blade, Voq.

29:37.817 --> 29:39.486
Son of none.

29:41.738 --> 29:46.910
The honor of Torchbearer is yours.

29:46.993 --> 29:50.038
Light the beacon!
