00:09.677 --> 00:11.343
<i>- Tell me about my day.</i>

00:13.163 --> 00:15.191
- You wake up to
the sound of rain.

00:15.215 --> 00:17.132
- That's dreary.

00:17.209 --> 00:20.010
- Oh, no.
It's the good kind of rain.

00:20.087 --> 00:23.055
Big, soft drops and warm.

00:23.131 --> 00:25.232
- That's better.

00:26.518 --> 00:30.154
- You take your bow and arrow,
go outside...

00:32.265 --> 00:35.817
You see tracks
near the creek bed.

00:35.894 --> 00:37.819
- White-tailed deer beast.

00:37.896 --> 00:39.007
- Mm-hmm.

00:39.031 --> 00:40.822
- I'm gonna get him
one of these days.

00:40.899 --> 00:42.499
- You will.

00:43.944 --> 00:46.628
You spot him there,
drinking in the reeds.

00:48.365 --> 00:51.833
The rain covers your sound,
your scent.

00:51.910 --> 00:53.919
He doesn't notice you.

00:53.995 --> 00:55.679
- I draw my bow.

00:57.833 --> 00:59.113
- And?

01:03.213 --> 01:07.066
- And... you wake up.

01:08.143 --> 01:10.235
It's how you know
I'm not with you.

01:13.598 --> 01:16.817
And you spend all day
waiting for me to come back.

01:16.893 --> 01:18.902
- That is what I do.

01:31.199 --> 01:33.092
- I like knowing
that you're waiting.

01:33.168 --> 01:35.168
Do you?

01:36.830 --> 01:38.110
- Mm.

01:40.425 --> 01:42.120
- Oh.

01:42.144 --> 01:44.686
I almost forgot.

01:56.892 --> 02:00.068
- How did you...

02:00.145 --> 02:03.780
- I was just waiting for
the right time.

02:06.276 --> 02:07.453

02:23.084 --> 02:25.438
- Yeah.

02:25.462 --> 02:27.721

02:41.269 --> 02:44.496
- No, no, no, no.

03:11.967 --> 03:13.191
One more kiss.

Good.

04:39.637 --> 04:41.508
Um... um, Bernard is waiting
for you.

04:41.532 --> 04:42.772
He's in the living room.

04:42.849 --> 04:45.158
He's taken three soma
in the past 52 minutes.

04:45.235 --> 04:47.786
- Hey, man.
- Where've you been?

04:47.863 --> 04:51.114
- You want something?
Gary makes a mean chicken pie.

04:51.191 --> 04:53.583
- No.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.397
I spent half the day
scanning the feeds,

04:55.421 --> 04:57.787
looking for you.
Where do you go?

04:57.864 --> 04:59.475
- Would it kill you to let him
make you a pie?

04:59.499 --> 05:01.278
He lives for this shit.

05:01.302 --> 05:03.877
- What's that?
- Huh?

05:03.953 --> 05:06.212
Oh!
Music.

05:06.289 --> 05:07.558
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:07.582 --> 05:10.717
- Where'd you get it?
- Um... just home.

05:10.794 --> 05:12.188
Thought I lost it,
but it turned up.

05:12.212 --> 05:13.979
- Hmm.

05:20.020 --> 05:23.313

05:37.963 --> 05:39.954
- Yeah, they used to.
- Why?

05:40.031 --> 05:42.343
- They wanted it
to mean something.

05:42.367 --> 05:46.136
<i>- ♪ You just keep me... ♪</i>
- I find it, um... distracting.

05:46.213 --> 05:47.348
- Okay.

05:49.049 --> 05:51.341
- You should sit down.
I... I'll sit down.

05:51.418 --> 05:53.051
Eh, let's sit.

05:53.128 --> 05:54.511
- What's wrong?

05:54.587 --> 05:55.929
- No, John, nothing is wrong.

05:56.005 --> 05:58.774
In fact, something
is very, very right.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.852
The Arch-Songster has
personally called us

06:02.929 --> 06:04.689
to his encampment.
- Ha!

06:06.474 --> 06:09.609
- Okay, I told you,
no more parties.

06:09.686 --> 06:11.473
- Yeah... no, and you were...
You were very clear, John.

06:11.497 --> 06:12.548
- Bernard!
- And if this was a simple

06:12.572 --> 06:14.364
party, John,
I... I wouldn't be here,

06:14.441 --> 06:17.575
but this is
an extraordinary opportunity.

06:17.652 --> 06:19.338
When the Arch-Songster
extends an invitation...

06:19.362 --> 06:21.963
- So go.
You don't need me.

06:23.509 --> 06:24.777
- I don't see why
you have to be like...

06:24.801 --> 06:25.612
- Because, you know, ever since

06:25.636 --> 06:27.127
you staged our little fight,

06:27.203 --> 06:29.796
all anyone wants to do
is point and stare

06:29.873 --> 06:31.684
and wait for me to do
something...

06:31.708 --> 06:33.144
you know?

06:33.168 --> 06:34.168
- You're different.

06:34.210 --> 06:35.271
- Yeah, I get it.

06:35.295 --> 06:36.761
- No, I mean lately.

06:36.838 --> 06:38.772
You're withdrawn.
You're...

06:41.026 --> 06:45.153
I want to help you, John.
It's my job.

06:46.848 --> 06:48.659
It would make it easier

06:48.683 --> 06:50.992
for me to look after you.
- Yeah, I bet it would.

06:52.854 --> 06:55.664
- Okay.
You're right.

06:55.740 --> 06:57.624
Forget it.

07:02.322 --> 07:04.881
- All right, look.
Hey!

07:04.958 --> 07:07.500
If I go to this,
if I go to your little party,

07:07.577 --> 07:09.002
this is the last time.

07:09.078 --> 07:10.639
Do you understand?
- Absolutely.

07:10.663 --> 07:13.223
- And I'm not putting
that thing in my eye.

07:14.292 --> 07:18.562
What I see, what's in my head,
that stays mine.

07:33.269 --> 07:35.912
I'm too old for this shit.

08:27.615 --> 08:31.334
<i>The only home we'll ever have,</i>

08:31.411 --> 08:34.504
<i>beautiful and abundant.</i>

08:34.581 --> 08:37.432
<i>And if we take care of it,</i>

08:37.509 --> 08:40.018
<i>it will give us all we need.</i>

08:41.963 --> 08:44.180
<i>This is our home.</i>

08:44.257 --> 08:48.726
<i>We live here together.
We work here;</i>

08:48.803 --> 08:51.437
<i>the place where we eat and grow</i>

08:51.514 --> 08:54.866
<i>and sleep and dream.</i>

08:56.894 --> 08:59.946
<i>And somewhere along the line,
we lost touch,</i>

09:00.023 --> 09:03.449
<i>became distracted
from our purpose,</i>

09:03.526 --> 09:06.169
<i>our shared destiny.</i>

09:07.488 --> 09:13.001
<i>It's time to wake
up... to look up</i>

09:13.077 --> 09:17.013
<i>and see what's possible
when we're all connected.</i>

09:19.184 --> 09:22.185
<i>Welcome to
a new kind of network,</i>

09:22.262 --> 09:25.605
<i>to keep us connected, always.</i>

09:27.467 --> 09:30.768
<i>Only when we look up
can we see this planet's</i>

09:30.845 --> 09:36.107
<i>most beautiful sight
of all... each other.</i>

09:43.950 --> 09:46.492
<i>- Remember when I was small?</i>

09:46.569 --> 09:50.005
<i>- Remember when this was
the only place I was?</i>

09:51.491 --> 09:53.458
<i>What are you looking for?</i>

09:53.534 --> 09:56.419
<i>Mustafa.
Mustafa Mond?</i>

09:56.496 --> 09:58.346
Mother?

10:01.801 --> 10:04.093
You see it now, don't you?

10:04.170 --> 10:06.229
You proud of me?
You must be proud.

10:06.306 --> 10:07.680
- What have you done?

10:07.757 --> 10:10.266
- I've solved it, my directive:

10:10.343 --> 10:13.311
achieve stability
in any system, any simulation.

10:13.388 --> 10:14.312
- It's not a simulation.

10:14.389 --> 10:15.666
- You keep saying that.

10:15.690 --> 10:17.409
I don't know what it means.
- It means...

10:17.433 --> 10:19.743
this is real.

10:19.819 --> 10:21.986
- In human society,
stability is achieved

10:22.063 --> 10:24.447
through the control of
neurochemical incentives;

10:24.524 --> 10:27.116
manipulation through
pharmacological intervention,

10:27.193 --> 10:29.004
sexual stimulation,
mass distraction...

10:29.028 --> 10:30.953
- Don't quote my thesis to me.

10:31.030 --> 10:34.248
- Sorry.
I thought you'd like it.

10:35.761 --> 10:37.012
The problem is people.

10:37.036 --> 10:38.847
No matter how perfect
the conditions,

10:38.871 --> 10:41.141
stability does not, cannot hold.

10:41.165 --> 10:44.342
It's frustrating.
- You changed strategy. Why?

10:44.419 --> 10:46.219
- You taught me to adapt.

10:46.295 --> 10:50.431
There's a flaw in you humans,
an unknown...

10:50.508 --> 10:52.444
some peptide that
does not fit the mold.

10:52.468 --> 10:54.196
- It's not a peptide.
- Whatever it is,

10:54.220 --> 10:56.780
it wants
what it shouldn't want...

10:58.433 --> 10:59.576
Unhappiness.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.495
In every human state of being,

11:01.519 --> 11:04.079
no matter the conditions,
it leaks out.

11:04.289 --> 11:06.768
It's what I'm trying to
tell you.

11:06.792 --> 11:09.325
I have found the state
at which you are stable.

11:10.570 --> 11:12.662
- You will be happy.

11:12.739 --> 11:15.748
You will remain happy.

11:28.628 --> 11:30.388
- This is a frolic.

11:30.465 --> 11:31.764
Okay, listen carefully.

11:31.841 --> 11:33.944
The Betas, they try to hide

11:33.968 --> 11:35.988
and the Alphas
try to catch them.

11:36.012 --> 11:38.020
- Okay, I get it.
I've played before.

11:38.097 --> 11:39.992
- In the Savage Lands?
- It's hide-and-seek.

11:40.016 --> 11:42.400
It's a kid's game.

11:42.477 --> 11:46.037
- And, uh, what do Savages do
when they catch their quarry?

11:47.774 --> 11:48.707
- Start over.

11:50.193 --> 11:52.034
Yeah, you haven't frolicked.

12:02.338 --> 12:04.431
- Is that him?

12:17.178 --> 12:20.938
I've seen him in the feeds,
but in the flesh,

12:21.015 --> 12:25.722
he is so much more fleshy.

12:31.359 --> 12:33.003
Thank you, Counselor.
He's perfect.

12:33.027 --> 12:34.660
- Oh, please call me Bernard.

12:34.737 --> 12:36.579
And, John... this is John.
John this is...

12:36.656 --> 12:38.790
- The Arch-Songster.
You've heard of me.

12:38.866 --> 12:41.125
- Afraid not.

12:41.202 --> 12:43.085
- Have you heard of music?

12:43.162 --> 12:45.797
- Music?
- Music, yes.

12:45.873 --> 12:48.299
- Yeah, I've heard of music.

12:48.376 --> 12:52.437
- Then now... you know
where it comes from.

12:53.881 --> 12:55.264
You're very welcome.

12:55.341 --> 12:59.352
I can think of nothing
more perfect

12:59.428 --> 13:02.814
than hunting with
our very own Savage.

13:02.890 --> 13:06.818
Your primitive instincts
must be tingling.

13:06.894 --> 13:09.278
- Yeah, something like that.

13:09.355 --> 13:11.906
- Okay, look,
the Betas will hide, and then...

13:11.983 --> 13:13.836
- Alphas find them.
I get it.

13:13.860 --> 13:15.910
What's with the costume?

13:15.987 --> 13:18.246
- The masks,
they inhibit our optics.

13:18.322 --> 13:22.667
Otherwise tracking those Betas
would be far, far too easy.

13:22.743 --> 13:24.928
- What about the suit?

13:25.004 --> 13:26.846
What does it do?

13:28.383 --> 13:32.677
- The suits?
They look fabulous.

13:35.965 --> 13:37.440
Someone bring the Savage a suit.

13:37.517 --> 13:41.769
Counselor, come with me.
There's people you must meet.

13:41.846 --> 13:44.397
- I'll... I'll be right back.

13:50.229 --> 13:51.863
- The Songster's insufferable.

13:51.939 --> 13:53.364
He makes 6,000 songs a year,

13:53.441 --> 13:56.200
and no one can tell
the difference.

13:56.277 --> 13:58.755
- I didn't expect to
see you here.

13:58.779 --> 14:00.746
- Where else would I be?

14:00.823 --> 14:02.540
It's a party.

14:02.617 --> 14:04.678
You'll need to put this suit on.

14:04.702 --> 14:06.845
Take off your clothes.

14:07.496 --> 14:08.950
Here. Allow me.
- No, I... really,

14:08.974 --> 14:10.601
I can do it myself.

14:10.625 --> 14:11.975
We need to talk.

14:13.669 --> 14:15.386
You don't belong here.

14:15.463 --> 14:17.722
- Bernard asked me to come.
So...

14:21.152 --> 14:23.405
- You're a man,
not some plaything

14:23.429 --> 14:25.866
to be passed around at parties.

14:25.890 --> 14:27.523
You're a sensation.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.526
These people are gonna use you
until you're not.

14:30.603 --> 14:33.195
They look at you,
but they don't see you, John.

14:33.272 --> 14:36.866
They can't see your...
Is it pain?

14:36.943 --> 14:38.159
- What?

14:38.235 --> 14:39.963
- Something new,

14:39.987 --> 14:43.715
something else,
something... rare.

14:43.791 --> 14:46.042
You can't hide it.

14:49.038 --> 14:51.141
I can see emotion
like you see color.

14:51.165 --> 14:55.705
I collect feelings, edit them,
perfect them.

14:55.729 --> 14:59.138
All the feelings in this city
are so boring...

14:59.215 --> 15:03.004
so ordinary, and you...
- Stop.

15:03.028 --> 15:07.438
- You feel more than anyone
I've ever...

15:09.767 --> 15:11.142
You can talk to me, John.

15:11.218 --> 15:14.612
It would feel good
to talk to me.

15:14.689 --> 15:16.183
I could...
- John.

15:16.207 --> 15:19.450
John, it's time.
- Ah, Bernie, there you are.

15:19.527 --> 15:21.254
- Everything all right?
- Isn't it always?

15:21.278 --> 15:23.755
Happy hunting.

15:23.831 --> 15:25.298
- All right, stay close.

15:39.714 --> 15:41.013
Ooh, what about her?

15:41.090 --> 15:42.982
- I told you, not interested.

15:44.552 --> 15:46.797
- Ooh, whoa, whoa,
hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.

15:46.821 --> 15:48.646
What about him?
- No.

15:48.723 --> 15:50.784
- Oh, sorry, I forgot you
people are strangely particular

15:50.808 --> 15:52.369
when it comes to gender.
- Can you stop?

15:52.393 --> 15:53.317
- I'm simply saying
there's pleasure

15:53.394 --> 15:54.588
to be found in everyone.

15:54.612 --> 15:55.747
It makes no sense
to deny yourself

15:55.771 --> 15:57.538
half the population.

15:58.399 --> 16:00.377
Oh, come on, John.
You used to enjoy this.

16:00.401 --> 16:02.379
- All right, you're having
so much fun, go catch one.

16:02.403 --> 16:04.006
- Maybe I will.
- Do it.

16:04.030 --> 16:06.550
- I just might.
I'm very fast.

16:06.574 --> 16:07.498
- Ah, you people.

16:07.575 --> 16:08.944
It's like you'll do anything
you can

16:08.968 --> 16:11.594
to pretend it's not the same
thing night after night.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.315
- What are you talking about?
It's never the same.

16:13.339 --> 16:16.077
Pleasure Gardens, joy boxes,
feelies, frolics...

16:16.101 --> 16:18.017
- Don't you ever want it
to mean something?

16:19.420 --> 16:22.013
Forget it.
You don't understand.

16:22.089 --> 16:24.056
Okay, look.

16:24.133 --> 16:27.018
Back home, you like a girl,
you ask her out.

16:27.094 --> 16:29.687
- For sex?
- No... I mean, yeah.

16:29.764 --> 16:33.524
I mean, you ask her out for
food or you... you take the car,

16:33.601 --> 16:35.596
you park it somewhere,
you get some beers,

16:35.620 --> 16:37.704
you turn on some music...
Like a date.

16:39.440 --> 16:42.000
- You're right.
I don't understand.

16:42.035 --> 16:43.670
- You're with somebody...
- Yeah.

16:43.694 --> 16:44.880
- And you're talking.
- Uh-huh.

16:44.904 --> 16:45.964
- Maybe there's some music on.

16:45.988 --> 16:47.090
It doesn't matter,
because that's not

16:47.114 --> 16:48.497
really what's happening.

16:48.574 --> 16:51.083
- No?
- No, not even close.

16:51.160 --> 16:53.836
Really, you're both
just thinking...

16:53.913 --> 16:55.504
"Are we gonna get there?

16:55.581 --> 16:59.225
Am I, right now, being
the person she wants?"

17:00.645 --> 17:02.094
- And if you're not?

17:02.171 --> 17:05.306
- That's what's good about it...
Not knowing.

17:05.382 --> 17:08.860
You're both waiting,
wanting each... forget it.

17:08.936 --> 17:10.216
- No, no, go on.

17:12.407 --> 17:15.816
- And if it happens,
it's because she chose you;

17:15.893 --> 17:17.660
you chose her.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.820
You both decided.

17:19.897 --> 17:22.643
You earned it from each other.

17:22.667 --> 17:27.745
- Ooh, that's,
uh... that's absurd.

17:27.822 --> 17:31.758
- It's the truth, and you don't
have to wear this silly shit.

17:36.038 --> 17:39.140
- Don't mind if I do.

17:42.270 --> 17:44.520
- Bernard, where the hell are...

19:31.546 --> 19:33.713
<i>Tell me about my day.</i>

19:40.120 --> 19:41.846
- Who was he?

19:47.169 --> 19:49.970
- I don't know.
Just some Alpha.

19:50.047 --> 19:52.640
It's only pleasure.
- You liked it.

19:52.716 --> 19:54.183
- That isn't what I said.

19:54.260 --> 19:56.060
- I want you to stop.

19:56.136 --> 19:57.416
- I'm a Beta Plus.

19:57.471 --> 20:00.898
I... I do what's expected.

20:00.975 --> 20:02.909
- Or what?

20:04.645 --> 20:06.195
- Or Indra will know.

20:06.272 --> 20:07.749
The system will know.
The Bureau...

20:07.773 --> 20:10.199
- Let them know.
They can't force you...

20:10.276 --> 20:13.252
- If they find out about us,
about what we're doing here,

20:13.329 --> 20:15.799
we'd be on display, a sensation;

20:15.823 --> 20:19.166
a Savage
and his Beta monogamist.

20:19.243 --> 20:21.822
We'll belong to everyone else.

20:21.846 --> 20:24.325
All of this will disappear,
no privacy...

20:24.349 --> 20:25.692
- I can't do this.
- No... John.

20:25.716 --> 20:27.591
- I can't.
You don't know what it's like

20:27.668 --> 20:30.353
to feel... to know that
you're out there every night,

20:30.429 --> 20:31.773
fucking someone every night.
- I want to.

20:31.797 --> 20:33.483
I wanna know what it's like.
I want to know.

20:33.507 --> 20:34.431
- No.
No!

20:34.508 --> 20:35.975
No, you don't.

20:36.051 --> 20:37.443
It hurts.

20:39.656 --> 20:42.158
- I'm a good Beta Plus
22 hours a day.

20:42.182 --> 20:44.094
I belong to everyone else
just so they won't ask,

20:44.118 --> 20:46.744
just so that we can belong
to each other here, like this.

20:46.821 --> 20:48.832
You think
that doesn't cost me anything?

20:48.856 --> 20:49.700
- Okay.

20:49.724 --> 20:52.284
Then stop.

20:53.110 --> 20:54.587
Why not?

20:54.611 --> 20:55.630
What are they gonna do?

20:55.654 --> 20:57.338
- Reconditioning, maybe.

20:58.907 --> 21:01.884
Or worse, banishment, sent away.

21:01.961 --> 21:05.045
- Sent where?
- I don't... no one comes back.

21:05.122 --> 21:08.661
- Good. Let's go there.
- John, it's bad.

21:08.685 --> 21:10.395
- How do you know?
- Becau...

21:10.419 --> 21:11.896
- Is that...
- Because I just do.

21:11.920 --> 21:14.201
- Is that what they told you
in your conditioning?

21:14.256 --> 21:15.472
- Listen to me, John.

21:15.549 --> 21:19.986
There's nowhere else
except here... with you.

21:22.139 --> 21:23.823
It's either this or nothing.

21:29.188 --> 21:30.788
I love you.

21:33.567 --> 21:35.543
- I saw you.
- I know.

21:40.115 --> 21:43.092
I... I don't wanna see.

21:45.079 --> 21:47.346
I don't wanna know.

22:26.346 --> 22:27.597

Optimal, thank you.

22:27.621 --> 22:29.213
- Are you sure?
You seem off.

22:30.624 --> 22:32.685
I should know better
than to try to fool you.

22:32.709 --> 22:36.187
You may be picking up
on a slight physical depletion

22:36.263 --> 22:37.458
after my exertions last night

22:37.482 --> 22:39.585
at the Arch-Songster's
encampment.

22:39.609 --> 22:41.111
I don't need to tell you
what that's like.

22:41.135 --> 22:44.019
You've, uh, been invited
yourself many times, I'm sure.

22:44.096 --> 22:46.313
- Of course.
It can be quite strenuous.

22:46.390 --> 22:49.900
- Oh, I expected to see you
there, but then... I didn't.

22:49.977 --> 22:53.570
- Well, Bernard,
that's because as Director,

22:53.647 --> 22:55.322
I have a number of
responsibilities

22:55.399 --> 22:57.074
that you couldn't possibly
understand.

22:57.151 --> 23:01.078
In fact, tonight, I have
my first official audience

23:01.155 --> 23:02.079
with World Controller Mond.

23:02.156 --> 23:03.756
- Hmm.

23:03.833 --> 23:06.509
At her sanctum?
- Yes, Bernard, at her sanctum.

23:06.585 --> 23:09.490
- Well, I do think
you'll find it interesting.

23:09.514 --> 23:11.171
- You've been?

23:11.248 --> 23:14.225
- I'll be curious to know
what you think of the art.

23:14.301 --> 23:15.570
- What?

23:15.594 --> 23:19.105
- Excuse me, Henry.
I believe I'm in session.

23:28.515 --> 23:30.157
Don't.

23:39.985 --> 23:42.494
- Bernard...

23:42.571 --> 23:44.307
you summoned me?

23:44.331 --> 23:45.714
- Yes, I did.

23:57.377 --> 23:58.561
How've you been?

23:58.637 --> 24:00.053
- Fine.

24:00.130 --> 24:02.973
- Took the liberty of
consulting your logs.

24:03.050 --> 24:03.974
- Oh?

24:04.051 --> 24:05.120
- I'd say you've been
rather busy.

24:05.144 --> 24:07.664
- I'm not entirely sure
what you...

24:07.688 --> 24:10.272
- Pleasure Gardens, feelies,
Vauxhall baths, frolics...

24:10.349 --> 24:13.484
- I'm sorry, I don't...
Is there a problem?

24:13.560 --> 24:15.185
- Problem?
No.

24:15.262 --> 24:18.155
Suppose I've noticed a few
private hours here and there,

24:18.232 --> 24:21.366
but nothing we can't look past
in light of your improvements.

24:21.443 --> 24:24.495
I'll admit, I, uh,
I was concerned.

24:24.571 --> 24:26.538
You seemed to have
some trouble adjusting

24:26.615 --> 24:28.591
when we came back
from the Savage Lands.

24:28.667 --> 24:30.885
- I'm fine now.
- Yes... no, so you said.

24:30.961 --> 24:33.721
And... well,
I can see that you are.

24:35.541 --> 24:36.757
- Why am I here?

24:36.833 --> 24:38.311
- Oh.

24:38.335 --> 24:39.471
Uh...

24:39.495 --> 24:43.647
well, I suppose I... I wanted to,
um...

24:47.219 --> 24:49.069
I wanted to ask, um...

24:51.265 --> 24:53.574
What you knew of
the Savage tradition of dating.

24:55.269 --> 24:56.454
- Dating?
- Mm.

24:56.478 --> 24:58.206
It's a Savage pretext
to sexual connection

24:58.230 --> 25:00.083
that I thought you would
find it interesting

25:00.107 --> 25:01.551
because I remember how much
you enjoyed learning

25:01.575 --> 25:04.335
about their, um... well,
you had... have the book.

25:04.411 --> 25:05.994
- Oh.

25:06.071 --> 25:07.423
Yes, the book.

25:07.447 --> 25:09.581
I remember.

25:09.658 --> 25:11.258
Bernard?

25:12.503 --> 25:14.753
Where did you get that?

25:14.830 --> 25:15.982
- As John described it to me,

25:16.006 --> 25:18.641
it begins with a proposal, um,

25:18.717 --> 25:20.175
and is followed by an outing.

25:20.252 --> 25:22.228
- Why am I here?

25:23.880 --> 25:25.981
- Lenina Crowne...

25:27.884 --> 25:30.519
Would you like to do dating?

25:30.596 --> 25:32.563
- Oh, with you?
- Yes, with me.

25:32.639 --> 25:34.134
Why not with me?
- No, it's just...

25:34.158 --> 25:35.618
- I don't see
what's so surprising.

25:35.642 --> 25:36.786
You clearly have no problem
coupling

25:36.810 --> 25:37.912
with these other Alphas,
none of whom

25:37.936 --> 25:39.464
have the slightest...
- All right.

25:39.488 --> 25:40.999
- Given our familiarity
and our experience,

25:41.023 --> 25:42.625
I thought, well...
- I said all right.

25:42.649 --> 25:44.283
Yes.

25:44.359 --> 25:45.793
I'd like that.

25:48.113 --> 25:51.415
- Oh, good.
Okay, that's... that's excellent.

25:51.491 --> 25:52.833
Tonight?

26:11.619 --> 26:13.195
- Do you ever think about it...

26:13.272 --> 26:17.825
The Savage Lands,
the, uh, Hotel Excelsion?

26:17.901 --> 26:19.680
- A counselor once told me that

26:19.704 --> 26:22.329
"Betas aren't supposed to think
at all."

26:25.901 --> 26:27.876
- You're not like the others.

26:30.405 --> 26:34.152
I find myself imagining what
it would be like to go back.

26:34.176 --> 26:36.736
- I don't think
anyone's gonna be returning to

26:36.787 --> 26:38.670
the Savage Lands anytime soon.

26:38.747 --> 26:40.339
- No, of course not.

26:40.415 --> 26:41.548
Right.

26:41.625 --> 26:44.343
I suppose I mean
go back in time.

26:44.419 --> 26:45.688
- Oh.

26:45.712 --> 26:48.147
- Like, not as we were but as...

26:49.800 --> 26:52.517
As we are now,
like, right here...

26:52.594 --> 26:55.215
in this moment, like,

26:55.239 --> 26:59.608
knowing what we know
and being who...

26:59.685 --> 27:01.652
I might proceed differently

27:01.728 --> 27:05.539
if we were in that room now...

27:05.616 --> 27:08.367
I mean...

27:08.443 --> 27:10.546
What do you think would happen?

27:10.570 --> 27:14.539
- I suppose what usually happens

27:14.616 --> 27:16.833
in hotel rooms.

27:16.910 --> 27:19.836
Whatever would happen...

27:19.913 --> 27:22.723
it wouldn't change what we have.

27:24.167 --> 27:27.511
- No, we do.
We feel a certain...

27:27.587 --> 27:29.513
closeness.

27:29.589 --> 27:31.440
'Cause...

27:34.928 --> 27:36.820
We've endured together.

27:38.682 --> 27:41.283
Hmm?
We... we... we shared something...

27:41.360 --> 27:42.868
- Special.

27:47.816 --> 27:49.315
It's made us friends.

27:53.071 --> 27:56.507
I'm glad it worked out
this way, Bernard.

28:00.120 --> 28:02.262
- Yeah, me too.

28:12.883 --> 28:15.934
<i>- ♪ I spend it with you ♪</i>

28:16.011 --> 28:19.049
<i>♪ Oh, such a perfect day ♪</i>

28:19.073 --> 28:21.148

28:32.286 --> 28:33.980
- He's here,

28:34.004 --> 28:37.442
the one who knocked
the Alpha down.

28:37.466 --> 28:39.666
- Where's his signifier?
- Doesn't have one.

28:48.144 --> 28:50.635
- Excellent.

28:50.712 --> 28:51.803
Now do me.

28:51.880 --> 28:53.638
- Fuck off.

29:27.415 --> 29:29.800
- What's... what's that...
What's that... that tune,

29:29.876 --> 29:31.802
that song you're singing?

29:31.878 --> 29:34.513
- Oh, I... I didn't
realize I was...

29:40.554 --> 29:42.187
- No, I don't know it.
It's very nice.

29:42.264 --> 29:43.783
- Yes, it's new...
- Oh.

29:43.807 --> 29:46.483
- I think.
Yeah.

29:53.233 --> 29:57.336
Is it over now... our dating?

29:58.947 --> 30:00.163
- No.

30:03.743 --> 30:05.344
- Where are we going?

30:06.746 --> 30:07.932
Bernard?

30:16.131 --> 30:19.891
- I'm sure she'll come soon.
She always does.

30:45.785 --> 30:47.614
- You.
It's him.

31:04.446 --> 31:06.238
- You again.

31:08.993 --> 31:11.493
Um, yeah.

31:11.570 --> 31:12.903
What's your name?

31:12.979 --> 31:14.613
- CJack60.

31:14.689 --> 31:17.165
- No, your name.

31:18.944 --> 31:21.244
- John.

31:21.321 --> 31:23.505
- Pick another.

31:26.409 --> 31:28.552
You'll think about it.

31:31.206 --> 31:33.159
- Where did you get that?

31:33.183 --> 31:35.017
- I gave it to myself.

31:37.545 --> 31:40.138
- I feel that way.

31:40.215 --> 31:42.223
- Sucks, don't it?

31:45.470 --> 31:46.937
Can I get a fucking beer?

31:47.013 --> 31:48.699
- Your happiness
is important to me.

31:48.723 --> 31:50.660
- Well, a fucking beer
is important to me.

31:50.684 --> 31:51.983
Is that too much to ask?

31:52.060 --> 31:53.744
- Fizz?

31:59.359 --> 32:00.659
- What are you looking at?

32:01.987 --> 32:04.024
Don't.
Don't clean that up!

32:04.048 --> 32:06.608
Jesus.
What is with you guys?

32:06.658 --> 32:07.832
- We love our work.

32:09.077 --> 32:10.304
- The fuck you do.

32:10.328 --> 32:12.003
You know who loves your work?

32:12.080 --> 32:13.630
Alphas.

32:13.707 --> 32:15.190
They love your work.

32:15.267 --> 32:19.427
They're up there,
getting laid, popping soma.

32:19.504 --> 32:21.304
You're<i> nothing</i> to them.

32:21.381 --> 32:22.931
You're garbagemen.

32:23.008 --> 32:25.517
You're washers of cars.

32:25.593 --> 32:29.646
They tell you you're happy?
You're not fucking happy.

32:29.723 --> 32:32.440
You're on drugs.
You know how I know that?

32:32.517 --> 32:34.534
Because<i> I'm</i> on drugs.

32:34.611 --> 32:38.080
This whole fucking place
is on drugs!

32:39.399 --> 32:42.000
People are not supposed
to live like this!

32:42.077 --> 32:43.938
They can't tell you who to want.

32:43.962 --> 32:48.068
They can't give you some letter
and tell you where you fit.

32:48.092 --> 32:50.875
You're supposed to want things.
You're supposed to choose.

32:50.952 --> 32:54.462
You're supposed to want things
and not get them

32:54.539 --> 32:57.298
and fuck everything up!

33:06.801 --> 33:07.851
Don't listen to me.

33:07.927 --> 33:10.061
I don't... I don't know what I'm...

33:10.138 --> 33:12.197
Sorry.
I'm tired.

33:37.582 --> 33:38.965
- Fizz?

33:39.042 --> 33:40.851
- No, thank you.

33:47.342 --> 33:48.975
- It's strange.

33:49.052 --> 33:51.612
I never know
what you're thinking.

33:53.157 --> 33:57.108
- I'm thinking the...
sun will be up soon.

33:57.185 --> 33:58.985
It's getting late.

33:59.062 --> 34:00.662
- Somewhere you need to be?

34:03.191 --> 34:05.283
- No.
- Good.

34:05.360 --> 34:07.920
We haven't finished
our date yet.

34:12.367 --> 34:14.217
Sofa, please.

34:32.137 --> 34:33.678
- So what now?

34:33.755 --> 34:36.656
I think you know "what now."

34:39.686 --> 34:43.116
- But I don't...
- Oh, that's right.

34:43.140 --> 34:45.259
This wasn't in the book, was it?

34:45.283 --> 34:48.493
Well, we've entered the final
phase of the date, you see,

34:48.570 --> 34:52.038
where the Savages decide
whether or not

34:52.115 --> 34:55.383
they've earned each other's
sexual connection...

34:57.745 --> 35:02.340
Whether they're worthy
of touch...

35:02.417 --> 35:06.511
whether they deserve
to be loved.

35:06.588 --> 35:08.666
- Bernard...
- Shall I go first?

35:08.690 --> 35:11.900
Yes.
That's my answer.

35:14.554 --> 35:17.405
I find you worthy, Lenina.

35:20.101 --> 35:21.827
I want you.

35:23.771 --> 35:25.288
Okay, your turn.

35:28.568 --> 35:31.953
Lenina?
What do you say?

35:35.116 --> 35:36.258
- Yes.

35:40.538 --> 35:44.558
- Good.
Well... well, that's settled.

35:46.728 --> 35:49.846
I suppose you should
take off your clothes.

35:56.738 --> 35:58.115
Or would you prefer the bed?

35:58.139 --> 36:00.231
- Doesn't matter.

36:00.308 --> 36:01.761
- No, I suppose not.

36:10.827 --> 36:18.827
- Sorry, the clasp...

36:19.994 --> 36:22.014
- Stop.
- No, it's this... this dress...

36:22.038 --> 36:24.358
- Stop it. Stop it.
Just get out. Get out.

36:24.382 --> 36:26.674
- I don't understand.
- Get out!

37:31.274 --> 37:33.667
- Tell me about my day.

37:47.623 --> 37:49.391
- Today, you came home.

38:50.103 --> 38:51.619
- Hello?

38:55.358 --> 38:57.283
Controller Mond?

38:57.360 --> 38:59.619
- You're too late.

38:59.695 --> 39:03.122
- I'm here to report to you.

39:03.199 --> 39:06.092
Pleased, in fact, to report
optimal satisfaction.

39:06.169 --> 39:08.448
- Everybody happy now?
- Precisely.

39:10.474 --> 39:11.826
Under my direction,

39:11.850 --> 39:15.477
the social body
is in perfect health,

39:15.553 --> 39:17.553
vibrant, engaged...

39:17.630 --> 39:20.640
- Everyone belongs
to everyone else.

39:20.716 --> 39:22.433
- Of course.

39:22.510 --> 39:24.986
- Our business is your pleasure.

39:26.180 --> 39:27.658
- I quite like that.
Is that new?

39:27.682 --> 39:29.802
- Tomorrow's devices
at yesterday's prices.

39:29.851 --> 39:31.692
- No, I'm not sure I follow.

39:31.769 --> 39:34.737
- We gave them
a billion glowing rectangles.

39:34.814 --> 39:36.550
They said they wanted to be
connected,

39:36.574 --> 39:38.574
but they didn't, not really.

39:38.651 --> 39:43.996
It made them sick
with loneliness, with doubt.

39:44.073 --> 39:47.458
<i>So we gave them
the Optic Interface,</i>

39:47.535 --> 39:52.505
<i>fantastic entertainments,
oh, avatars, sprites.</i>

39:52.582 --> 39:55.383
More human than their friends.
We offered them the network,

39:55.460 --> 39:56.937
hooked straight
into their minds.

39:56.961 --> 39:59.022
All they had to do was
"click," "accept,"

39:59.046 --> 40:01.046
"click," "accept,"
"click," "accept."

40:02.091 --> 40:03.853
<i>They would have done anything...</i>

40:03.877 --> 40:07.979
<i>Anything to protect themselves
from those terrible moments;</i>

40:08.055 --> 40:11.190
waiting on a bus,
watching a lover sleep...

40:11.267 --> 40:12.887
Those agonizing seconds

40:12.911 --> 40:15.703
where there's nowhere else
to look but inside.

40:19.775 --> 40:21.795
It's dark in there, Director.

40:27.825 --> 40:29.667
- You can give people feelings?

40:29.744 --> 40:31.594
- Yes, John, I can.

40:33.956 --> 40:36.674
- Can you take them away?

40:36.751 --> 40:40.164
- Emotions are chemical
reactions.

40:40.188 --> 40:42.305
I record signals,

40:42.381 --> 40:45.567
refine them,
transmit them to my audience.

40:46.677 --> 40:49.437
I can make anyone feel anything.

40:49.514 --> 40:53.074
All you have to do is connect.

40:54.143 --> 40:57.236
- I control nothing.

40:57.313 --> 40:59.809
You direct... nothing.

40:59.833 --> 41:03.242
Indra turns the wheel,
true to her design...

41:03.319 --> 41:08.039
seeks the variable,
the disruptor...

41:09.700 --> 41:11.000
<i>- The virus.</i>

41:15.173 --> 41:16.589
<i>She'll never stop reaching out</i>

41:16.666 --> 41:19.579
<i>until she makes a connection,</i>

41:19.603 --> 41:21.469
<i>fulfills her purpose...</i>

41:24.632 --> 41:26.691
<i>The directive.</i>

41:28.511 --> 41:30.612
<i>- What directive?</i>

41:31.689 --> 41:33.281
<i>- Death.</i>
