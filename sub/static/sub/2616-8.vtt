WEBVTT

00:15.960 --> 00:18.268
So, that is when they said,

00:19.807 --> 00:21.768
We need you for our December cover.

00:22.686 --> 00:23.641
I said no.

00:23.653 --> 00:26.073
I mean,I could have children someday.

00:27.314 --> 00:28.840
Children are... They're nice.

00:29.212 --> 00:30.602
But not your cup of tea.

00:30.637 --> 00:31.799
Well, there's...

00:31.834 --> 00:32.961
No apologies.

00:33.232 --> 00:36.384
No one loves a shallow
sexual relationsip

00:36.815 --> 00:38.118
more than me.

00:38.353 --> 00:39.768
This is good to know.

00:42.832 --> 00:44.135
Hello.

00:45.661 --> 00:47.088
Yes, it's me.

00:49.624 --> 00:52.217
What's the matter? You didn't
expect to see me here tonight?

00:53.160 --> 00:54.872
And we have five more minutes, or

00:54.885 --> 00:58.111
actually, uh, we four
minutes and 34 seconds.

00:58.928 --> 01:00.740
Do you want me to try to explain?

01:01.397 --> 01:03.333
I would love an explanation.

01:04.040 --> 01:05.367
Ready, set,

01:05.752 --> 01:07.055
go.

01:09.797 --> 01:11.124
Financial planner.

01:12.377 --> 01:14.251
I own my own condo outright.

01:14.699 --> 01:17.006
Never been married. Probably
cause I work seven days a week.

01:17.230 --> 01:18.432
I know.

01:18.433 --> 01:19.433
You know?

01:19.633 --> 01:21.364
You were Rebecca #7 at

01:21.399 --> 01:23.095
the Biscayne Grill.

01:23.130 --> 01:24.484
Right.

01:25.625 --> 01:27.228
Excuse me.May I get another
one of these, please?

01:30.975 --> 01:31.908
You're one of those.

01:31.943 --> 01:34.362
Probably can't hold your
attention for more five seconds.

01:50.447 --> 01:52.184
Alexx,who do we have?

01:56.019 --> 01:58.227
Richard Laken, 35 years old.

01:59.182 --> 02:00.500
Based on his cash,

02:00.535 --> 02:02.644
robbery was not the motive.

02:02.830 --> 02:04.139
Was he bludgeoned?

02:04.174 --> 02:05.448
Can't tell with what.

02:06.056 --> 02:08.500
I'll have to get a good look
at these subdural injuries.

02:09.145 --> 02:10.437
His car was vandalized,

02:10.473 --> 02:12.706
suggesting a murder of passion.

02:12.793 --> 02:14.381
Wasn't enough just to kill him?

02:14.456 --> 02:15.734
Patrol called it in.

02:15.746 --> 02:17.148
Owner says the last people that saw him

02:17.183 --> 02:18.724
alive are long gone.

02:18.759 --> 02:19.694
Was he alone?

02:19.729 --> 02:21.268
No, he was with about 30 people.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.824
They had some sort of
matchmaker party here last night.

02:23.848 --> 02:25.374
Matchmaker in South Beach?

02:25.409 --> 02:26.901
Bunch of singles get together,

02:27.000 --> 02:28.292
play musical chairs. Get to know

02:28.327 --> 02:30.822
each other over drinks. Have
a date every five minutes.

02:31.653 --> 02:33.278
They call it speed-dating.

02:33.576 --> 02:35.574
Owner says our victim had 15 dates.

02:35.576 --> 02:37.337
Well, you know what they say,Frank.

02:37.561 --> 02:39.074
Speed kills.

03:41.630 --> 03:42.982
Cell phone's off.

03:42.995 --> 03:45.998
Rigor indicates he's been
here at least six hours.

03:50.700 --> 03:52.859
Looks like a scorecard for the ladies.

03:53.207 --> 03:54.844
Checked every nook and
cranny on this block.

03:54.879 --> 03:55.963
No murder weapon.

03:55.998 --> 03:57.785
Well, it may have had
some value for the killer,

03:57.820 --> 03:59.266
and they took it with them.

03:59.301 --> 04:00.713
Calleigh, I smell acetone.

04:01.023 --> 04:02.798
Acetone with a hint of lemon.

04:03.306 --> 04:05.143
I think it's nail polish remover.

04:05.217 --> 04:07.277
Whoever vandalized the
car was probably female.

04:07.500 --> 04:08.964
That would be half our speed-daters.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.627
Yes, it would. Frank,

04:10.887 --> 04:12.587
it is time to talk to the owner.

04:13.295 --> 04:14.746
Thank you, ladies.

04:20.380 --> 04:21.918
This stuff is supposed
to be confidential

04:21.930 --> 04:24.040
You're putting me in a
really bad position here

04:24.075 --> 04:25.628
That's my specialty

04:25.802 --> 04:27.117
All right, look, what do you want again?

04:27.129 --> 04:29.002
I want the list of everybody

04:29.037 --> 04:30.876
that sat with my victim.

04:30.888 --> 04:32.613
The names are on my sign-up roster.

04:32.650 --> 04:34.499
There are 15 women, 15 men.

04:34.549 --> 04:35.715
I'd have to look for it.

04:35.750 --> 04:36.881
I suggest that you do.

04:38.266 --> 04:39.854
Do you recall Richard Laken in any

04:39.889 --> 04:41.172
altercations?

04:41.207 --> 04:42.844
Like bruised egos,

04:43.043 --> 04:44.335
broken hearts,a drink in the face?

04:44.370 --> 04:46.442
You know, I'm not a
chaperone. I spend the night

04:46.628 --> 04:48.105
catching up on paperwork.

04:48.824 --> 04:50.698
Here are the applications
from last night's participants.

04:51.393 --> 04:52.857
Phone and addresses are in there.

04:54.073 --> 04:55.612
Okay, a paralegal...

04:56.902 --> 04:58.341
a web designer,

04:58.589 --> 04:59.699
flight attendant,

04:59.734 --> 05:00.991
financial planner.

05:01.026 --> 05:02.249
Demanding jobs.

05:02.671 --> 05:04.135
People don't have time to date.

05:04.173 --> 05:05.575
Wait a second, Frank.

05:06.542 --> 05:08.813
Mary Kinnan, hair stylist.

05:09.335 --> 05:11.283
A hair stylist, Frank
she has an access to

05:11.318 --> 05:12.871
acetone, doesn't she?

05:12.876 --> 05:14.340
Guy's car was dunked in it.

05:14.375 --> 05:15.804
Yes. Take Eric and find out

05:15.805 --> 05:17.447
what made Mary so unhappy

05:17.482 --> 05:19.090
in under five minutes.

05:19.755 --> 05:21.066
All right.

05:44.076 --> 05:45.475
We're looking for Mary Kinnan.

05:45.510 --> 05:46.802
Is she here?

05:47.507 --> 05:49.026
In the house I built but don't live in?

05:49.061 --> 05:50.734
You bet you. Help yourself.

05:51.856 --> 05:52.724
What's in the box?

05:52.759 --> 05:54.248
Well, you want to
know, call your lawyer.

05:54.283 --> 05:55.523
Oh, fine, I'll do that,

05:55.558 --> 05:57.504
and I'll stick you with the legal fees.

05:59.132 --> 06:00.864
He dumped me four months ago for a site

06:00.899 --> 06:03.093
manager, and he's surprised
that I want the house.

06:04.513 --> 06:06.935
We understand you attended a
speed-dating event last night.

06:09.467 --> 06:10.737
I did.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.316
There might be a lot of
fish in the sea, but I

06:12.351 --> 06:13.984
can't be reeling them in one at a time.

06:14.019 --> 06:15.483
I've got three kids in there.

06:15.770 --> 06:17.210
You know Richard Laken?

06:17.745 --> 06:18.524
Yes.

06:18.559 --> 06:20.117
He was murdered last night

06:20.152 --> 06:21.676
outside the Neuron Lounge.

06:22.222 --> 06:23.701
Oh, my God.

06:24.555 --> 06:25.865
I...

06:26.421 --> 06:27.656
Um...

06:27.691 --> 06:29.975
we met a couple months
ago at-at a night,

06:30.184 --> 06:31.429
and then

06:31.464 --> 06:33.539
we had a few real dates after that.

06:33.946 --> 06:35.246
Someone also vandalized his

06:35.281 --> 06:36.666
car with acetone,

06:37.083 --> 06:39.287
an ingredient you use as a hairstylist.

06:40.290 --> 06:41.615
Wait a minute.

06:41.650 --> 06:42.940
You think that...?

06:42.975 --> 06:43.704
Yeah, we do.

06:44.066 --> 06:45.476
And we'd like to search the premises

06:45.511 --> 06:47.074
to see if we find any acetone.

06:49.347 --> 06:50.598
Okay.

06:51.148 --> 06:53.302
Okay, I threw acetone on his car.

06:54.364 --> 06:55.977
No. Richard told me
that he was getting back

06:56.012 --> 06:58.047
together with his ex, and
then I see him last night at

06:58.068 --> 06:59.497
speed-dating, playing the field.

06:59.596 --> 07:01.016
And so, you were mad?

07:01.194 --> 07:02.564
No, I was insulted.

07:03.022 --> 07:04.307
And during the break, I

07:04.342 --> 07:05.821
went outside to make a point.

07:15.272 --> 07:17.078
Okay, it was... it was stupid,

07:17.099 --> 07:18.573
I know, all right? But I went...

07:18.608 --> 07:20.701
I went back inside,
and-and that was it.

07:24.385 --> 07:26.048
Look, I watched him get up and leave

07:26.083 --> 07:28.276
right after the final bell.
He didn't even turn his card

07:28.311 --> 07:29.944
in, and-and he was alive, okay?

07:30.793 --> 07:32.192
You know why he ran out?

07:33.522 --> 07:35.537
I figured he didn't
want to see me again.

07:37.806 --> 07:39.026
All right.

07:39.036 --> 07:40.277
Appreciate it.

07:42.064 --> 07:44.575
I'll call Horatio, tell him
something had our victim on the run.

07:44.924 --> 07:46.631
All right, I'm gonna check her story.

08:48.783 --> 08:50.123
What you doing?

08:51.027 --> 08:53.201
Confirming Mary Kinnan's story.

08:54.977 --> 08:57.618
She poured at least
four liters of acetone

08:57.778 --> 08:59.366
on Richard Laken's car.

09:05.921 --> 09:07.569
It was evaporated in 30 minutes.

09:07.648 --> 09:09.306
Yeah. It was gone when we got there.

09:09.375 --> 09:11.381
So, if Richard Laken was murdered

09:11.550 --> 09:13.133
while his car was being vandalized,

09:13.168 --> 09:14.717
the acetone would have still been wet

09:15.133 --> 09:16.454
and dripped on his shoe.

09:16.861 --> 09:18.429
I checked. There's not a drop.

09:19.718 --> 09:21.207
Meaning she ruined his paint job

09:21.217 --> 09:23.272
at intermission, not
at the end of the night.

09:23.351 --> 09:25.178
Meaning, our divorcee
was telling the truth.

09:25.675 --> 09:27.015
Hey, guys,

09:27.134 --> 09:29.328
Alexx called up. Said
Richard Laken's on deck.

09:33.904 --> 09:35.095
You go.

09:35.155 --> 09:36.242
To the autopsy?

09:36.277 --> 09:38.262
Yeah, to the autopsy.
What, are you scared?

09:38.978 --> 09:40.487
No, not at all. I'll go.

09:41.400 --> 09:42.373
Thanks, guys.

09:42.382 --> 09:43.663
Have fun.

09:46.007 --> 09:47.347
It's a head trauma, right?

09:50.851 --> 09:52.160
This Richard Laken?

09:52.288 --> 09:53.628
Heard you're the man today.

09:53.856 --> 09:55.653
I've observed autopsies before.

09:56.914 --> 09:57.793
Once.

09:57.828 --> 09:59.267
As a student through the

09:59.714 --> 10:00.989
glass.

10:01.024 --> 10:02.513
Then step right up.

10:04.430 --> 10:06.773
You see the contusions on the forearms?

10:07.914 --> 10:09.120
Had to be antemortem

10:09.155 --> 10:11.061
He was trying to defend himself.

10:19.551 --> 10:20.638
What is it?

10:20.673 --> 10:21.725
I don't know,

10:22.003 --> 10:23.383
but it's silver,

10:23.661 --> 10:25.051
and there's a lot of it.

10:26.063 --> 10:27.393
Might be paint.

10:27.949 --> 10:29.289
I'll take it to Trace.

10:29.324 --> 10:30.391
You do that.

10:34.791 --> 10:36.081
Alexx?

10:36.985 --> 10:38.325
He doesn't have a head.

10:39.260 --> 10:40.570
Where'd the head go?

10:41.443 --> 10:42.734
I'm processing it.

10:45.930 --> 10:47.087
You're boiling it?

10:47.122 --> 10:48.993
Can't determine the
type of murder weapon

10:49.028 --> 10:50.864
from the injuries to his arms and torso.

10:52.852 --> 10:54.162
But...

10:59.295 --> 11:00.863
with a shattered mandible,

11:01.220 --> 11:03.066
depressed skull fractures, and

11:03.101 --> 11:04.913
intracranial hemorrhaging,

11:05.218 --> 11:06.855
his head may tell us what hit him.

11:07.391 --> 11:09.158
I'm gonna remove the soft tissue,

11:09.764 --> 11:11.174
get a better look.

11:11.203 --> 11:12.503
The skin...

11:14.624 --> 11:16.898
Think I understand why
Calleigh and Delko sent me.

11:20.151 --> 11:21.471
You okay, Ryan?

11:23.297 --> 11:25.471
Okay, why don't you go on over to Trace,

11:25.672 --> 11:27.003
and I'll finish up here, okay?

11:39.066 --> 11:40.659
Tyler, do we have the floor plan

11:40.694 --> 11:42.252
to the Neuron Lounge, please?

11:42.287 --> 11:43.753
Every square inch.

11:43.788 --> 11:45.220
Okay. Now, Mary Kinnan

11:45.476 --> 11:47.659
said Richard was in a
hurry to leave the table,

11:47.694 --> 11:49.843
right? I need to know
who he sat with last.

11:50.718 --> 11:52.608
Okay, all these speed-daters filled out

11:52.643 --> 11:54.748
these cards, turned 'em
in at the end of the night.

11:55.175 --> 11:57.090
I've been translating them.

11:58.725 --> 12:00.730
Every person was given a number

12:01.683 --> 12:03.103
corresponds with a table.

12:03.918 --> 12:05.536
They move every five minutes.

12:05.675 --> 12:07.313
So, it's a well-oiled machine.

12:07.402 --> 12:08.891
Your victim, Richard Laken, started

12:08.926 --> 12:10.767
his evening at Table 12.

12:12.028 --> 12:14.102
Only the men change tables.

12:20.772 --> 12:22.092
Rebecca Briggs.

12:22.320 --> 12:23.888
She's the one Richard ran from.

12:23.969 --> 12:25.254
Okay, so the question becomes

12:25.289 --> 12:27.493
did Rebecca go after him? Thank you.

12:33.183 --> 12:35.019
You were the last one to
see him alive, Rebecca.

12:38.475 --> 12:40.083
I told you, when he left my table, that

12:40.118 --> 12:41.810
was it. I never saw him again.

12:47.047 --> 12:48.645
This scratch looks fresh.

12:50.919 --> 12:53.360
I have cats. It's how
they show affection.

12:54.085 --> 12:55.604
You pick up any habits from them?

12:58.284 --> 12:59.654
I don't like him.

12:59.922 --> 13:00.949
Rebecca,

13:00.984 --> 13:03.267
the medical examiner is doing Richard's

13:03.268 --> 13:05.025
autopsy as we speak.

13:06.524 --> 13:08.519
If he scratched you, I'm
going to know about it,

13:08.857 --> 13:09.904
So...

13:09.939 --> 13:12.212
this is your opportunity
to change your story.

13:15.250 --> 13:16.510
All right...

13:16.997 --> 13:18.377
I did follow him...

13:18.764 --> 13:20.749
because I knew he was the guy.

13:21.593 --> 13:22.903
The guy?

13:23.112 --> 13:24.591
My condo. Last week,

13:24.626 --> 13:26.070
when I got home,

13:26.080 --> 13:28.095
my laptop, my stereo system,

13:28.096 --> 13:30.131
my plasma screen everything was gone.

13:31.421 --> 13:32.979
Hey, Richard!

13:33.674 --> 13:35.540
Are you done now, huh?
You got enough info?

13:35.544 --> 13:36.601
What, are you crazy?

13:36.636 --> 13:37.634
Who you robbing tonight, huh?

13:37.669 --> 13:39.098
Which girl's it going to be this time?

13:43.085 --> 13:44.594
Why do you suspect Richard?

13:44.922 --> 13:46.937
I know it was one of
those speed-dating guys.

13:46.972 --> 13:48.952
They're the only guys
that I spill everything to.

13:49.588 --> 13:51.136
It's weird, you know, when
you're under the clock,

13:51.171 --> 13:52.734
you feel compelled to tell them

13:52.794 --> 13:54.432
everything right away

13:54.601 --> 13:56.943
your habits, your
secrets, your schedule.

13:57.167 --> 13:58.567
You file a police report?

13:58.994 --> 13:59.957
No.

13:59.976 --> 14:02.140
I- I thought I could
figure it out myself.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.791
And I felt stupid enough
without bringing the police in.

14:05.535 --> 14:08.166
I- I really thought
I had him last night.

14:09.050 --> 14:10.435
Richard he just looked...

14:10.470 --> 14:12.505
he looked so guilty standing there.

14:12.703 --> 14:13.993
Guilty?

14:14.521 --> 14:15.950
You know, Rebecca, in my line of work,

14:15.985 --> 14:17.360
do you know what they call that?

14:17.916 --> 14:19.444
They call it motive.

14:33.611 --> 14:35.388
Rebecca Briggs was
cleaned out, all right.

14:35.805 --> 14:37.353
Whoever did it got in somehow.

14:38.396 --> 14:40.838
I'll, uh... I'll check
the back for forced entry.

14:41.148 --> 14:42.185
Frank,

14:42.220 --> 14:44.930
the scene of the crime is
the entertainment center.

15:01.546 --> 15:02.770
Might have something.

15:02.800 --> 15:05.819
I'm no CSI, but it looks to be
more of a smear than a print.

15:05.847 --> 15:07.432
Probably not much help.

15:07.817 --> 15:13.336
Well, if it's a smear, Frank, there may
be enough ridge detail to capture some DNA.

15:16.764 --> 15:18.549
You talking skin cells?

15:18.587 --> 15:20.052
If he's a shedder...

15:21.798 --> 15:23.787
there could be enough stripped nuclei.

15:25.690 --> 15:27.652
for Valera to work on.

15:32.449 --> 15:34.269
You can get DNA from that?

15:34.281 --> 15:35.526
Frank...

15:37.346 --> 15:40.093
there's more than one
kind of fingerprint.

15:45.604 --> 15:47.506
Hey, you looking for me?

15:47.539 --> 15:51.320
I was- finally finished
Richard Laken's skull.

15:51.367 --> 15:52.788
Looks like a museum piece.

15:52.811 --> 15:55.265
Yeah, the end result usually does.

15:55.300 --> 15:57.919
Three blows, all to the parietal bone.

15:57.967 --> 16:01.548
The first two cracked the
skull No tool impressions.

16:01.584 --> 16:03.650
Luckily for us, the killer got angrier.

16:03.662 --> 16:05.588
This one broke clean through.

16:06.081 --> 16:08.312
Gave us something to work with.

16:13.123 --> 16:14.191
What kind of weapon?

16:14.215 --> 16:16.023
You're the CSI.

16:16.047 --> 16:17.690
That part's up to you.

18:17.896 --> 18:20.256
So, uh, how'd it go in autopsy?

18:21.536 --> 18:22.933
I handled it.

18:23.977 --> 18:25.538
Who hazed you?

18:25.562 --> 18:26.501
Speedle.

18:26.524 --> 18:28.063
A headless woman.

18:29.225 --> 18:31.104
Freaked me out a little, too.

18:33.802 --> 18:36.092
So, what killed Richard Laken?

18:36.444 --> 18:38.263
Based on the paint from Richard's arms

18:38.298 --> 18:42.140
and the measurements on these guys,
he was killed with a tire iron.

18:43.785 --> 18:45.425
Okay, now we know
what we're looking for.

18:45.577 --> 18:46.716
Good work.

18:48.583 --> 18:51.601
Valera, the DNA from the
condo. Is it Richard Laken's?

18:51.622 --> 18:53.688
Nope. Meet Chad Gilbert.

18:53.712 --> 18:56.471
Got a three year sentence
for burglary in '99.

18:56.495 --> 18:58.550
So Chad is at it again, huh?

18:58.573 --> 19:00.957
Yeah, and get this: I
checked it against your list.

19:00.966 --> 19:02.903
He's another one of your speed-daters.

19:02.927 --> 19:04.430
Interesting.

19:04.453 --> 19:05.369
Thank you, Valera.

19:11.215 --> 19:13.105
That better be you, Sully.

19:13.666 --> 19:16.895
Hey, get down! Kiss the
floor, Chad! Now! Get down!

19:20.018 --> 19:20.652
Frank?

19:20.676 --> 19:21.756
He's clean.

19:26.055 --> 19:27.934
Ooh, Chad.

19:27.969 --> 19:31.504
What do we have here? Ooh, look at this.

19:32.143 --> 19:35.255
Chad was on his way to
the fence. Huh, Chad?

19:35.305 --> 19:38.922
Looks like Rebecca Briggs'
plasma screen, laptop.

19:39.016 --> 19:40.177
Yes, it does. Let me ask you
a question, Chad.

19:40.212 --> 19:43.677
How many women have you ripped off
under the guise of speed-dating?

19:43.713 --> 19:45.979
Look, man, it's just burglary.
Nobody's getting hurt.

19:45.997 --> 19:47.440
Really? You're about to get
hurt. You're looking at

19:47.475 --> 19:51.997
one year minimum if you don't
answer the next question correctly.

19:52.033 --> 19:55.097
Was Richard Laken involved
in your little scam?

19:55.144 --> 19:57.152
Richard? Number 12? No.

19:57.253 --> 20:00.188
That guy's there for the women,
man. He-he thinks he's a real player.

20:00.224 --> 20:03.218
Was he into any special
woman last night?

20:03.241 --> 20:07.668
Well, I did see him acting kind of strange,
you know, right before the final bell.

20:08.676 --> 20:09.921
E- Excuse me.

20:16.212 --> 20:19.124
But I don't think it was about
that chick he was sitting with.

20:19.136 --> 20:21.848
No, he... he saw
something or-or somebody.

20:22.107 --> 20:23.387
The guy went white as a sheet.

20:23.398 --> 20:25.383
And you noticed all that, huh, Chad?

20:25.463 --> 20:28.621
Look, I notice
everything about everyone.

20:28.633 --> 20:30.065
It's what I do.

20:34.938 --> 20:35.983
Hey, Tyler.

20:36.010 --> 20:38.499
Hey. 3D software's loaded.

20:38.546 --> 20:40.119
What do you want to see?

20:40.143 --> 20:43.653
Who Richard was staring at before
he left the speed-dating event.

20:43.781 --> 20:48.019
But... wasn't it the girl in
front of him, Rebecca Briggs?

20:48.043 --> 20:50.262
Horatio thinks it was someone else.

20:50.743 --> 20:52.411
Okay...

20:55.738 --> 20:57.992
Richard Laken is in yellow.

20:58.262 --> 21:00.552
Rebecca is the first one, in purple.

21:01.233 --> 21:03.511
Connie #12 is the next woman.

21:03.814 --> 21:05.282
And who's the guy?

21:09.779 --> 21:13.078
According to this, he could've
been looking at Jack Smith.

21:14.297 --> 21:15.530
Thanks, Tyler.

21:19.159 --> 21:20.051
Hey.

21:20.297 --> 21:21.108
Hey.

21:21.352 --> 21:25.567
The lounge floor plan said the person
in Richard's sight line was a Jack Smith.

21:25.603 --> 21:26.812
Jack Smith?

21:26.859 --> 21:29.068
Here's his application. I
was about to go and see him.

21:29.103 --> 21:30.400
Hey, hang on a second.

21:30.435 --> 21:31.697
There's a problem.

21:31.717 --> 21:33.514
Take a look at that address.

21:34.676 --> 21:36.860
1126 Charthouse Drive.

21:36.884 --> 21:37.964
It's in the Grove.

21:37.985 --> 21:43.339
Miami Beach Cafe, which is right on
the water, is at 1028 Charthouse, right?

21:43.783 --> 21:49.465
So 1126 would probably make his front
door out in the Atlantic, wouldn't it?

21:49.501 --> 21:51.168
He lied on his application.

21:51.213 --> 21:55.275
Possibly, if he exists at all.
Whoever he is, let's find him, okay?

21:57.612 --> 21:58.904
Jack Smith...

21:59.702 --> 22:01.651
Um, w-what number was he?

22:02.086 --> 22:03.589
Number 13.

22:03.730 --> 22:06.325
We don't think Jack
Smith was his real name.

22:07.793 --> 22:10.223
I'm sorry, I-I'm drawing a blank.

22:10.282 --> 22:12.160
I guess he wasn't my type.

22:12.565 --> 22:15.125
Richard was staring at him
during your date together.

22:15.148 --> 22:20.021
Do you by any chance remember exactly
what you were talking about when he left?

22:20.150 --> 22:22.863
Excuse me. May I get
another one of these, please?

22:23.187 --> 22:24.208
You're one of those.

22:24.232 --> 22:27.120
You probably can't hold your
attention for more than five seconds.

22:27.836 --> 22:30.831
He said something about the heat.

22:31.476 --> 22:32.568
It's the heat.

22:32.827 --> 22:33.707
It is hot.

22:34.498 --> 22:36.118
They say it might rain tomorrow.

22:36.329 --> 22:38.689
No, the... the game the other night...

22:39.253 --> 22:41.273
The game, right. Basketball.

22:41.308 --> 22:42.693
What about the game?

22:42.891 --> 22:47.094
And then he shot out of his chair like
I said I wanted to elope and have twins.

22:47.622 --> 22:48.808
Does that help?

22:48.855 --> 22:50.135
More than you know.

22:51.196 --> 22:52.792
What do we have?

22:52.992 --> 22:55.862
Well, so far, just that
Richard Laken was rattling on

22:55.863 --> 22:58.839
about the Miami Heat right
before he bolted the lounge.

22:58.873 --> 23:03.299
You know, we did find a ticket stub in his
wallet. Maybe he saw something at the game.

23:03.323 --> 23:08.595
The Arena has an event index that logs
everything that happens at the game.

23:09.244 --> 23:10.865
Let's see.

23:10.970 --> 23:13.131
Fan altercations.

23:13.201 --> 23:17.546
Found lost child at Gate 3 concession
stand, reunited with parent.

23:17.602 --> 23:21.301
Helped G. Lewis Davis find
lost wallet in section 412.

23:21.336 --> 23:23.954
Tended to sick fan during halftime show.

23:23.990 --> 23:26.314
Assisted fan complaining of chest pains.

23:27.099 --> 23:28.484
No Richard Laken.

23:28.519 --> 23:31.678
That was all inside, wasn't
it? What about outside?

23:32.512 --> 23:34.801
I'm gonna check anything
in the Arena's zip code.

23:34.834 --> 23:38.227
Then I'll cross-reference it with
the date and time of the game.

23:40.798 --> 23:43.241
Well, look at that. Richard Laken.

23:43.262 --> 23:46.702
Richard Laken witnessed an assault
Saturday night after the game.

23:46.725 --> 23:48.123
He made a statement to the police.

23:48.146 --> 23:50.401
Bring up that statement, please.

23:53.395 --> 23:58.656
Two white men attacked Marcus Washington,
in a private parking lot outside the Arena.

24:00.194 --> 24:02.413
Every single free throw he missed!

24:03.071 --> 24:03.904
It's ridiculous!

24:04.100 --> 24:04.934
Hey, man!

24:09.278 --> 24:12.319
One hit him; the other
one tended to him.

24:12.343 --> 24:14.879
Right, but both men fled
the scene, didn't they?

24:14.914 --> 24:16.523
Case is still open.

24:16.828 --> 24:21.020
His mother was with him, but she was
too shaken up to remember anything.

24:21.043 --> 24:22.805
So Laken's the only reliable witness.

24:22.816 --> 24:24.707
Until someone killed him.

24:24.836 --> 24:26.362
What about the victim?

24:26.425 --> 24:30.041
Marcus Washington is in critical
condition at Dade Memorial Hospital.

24:30.138 --> 24:34.036
Dade Memorial. That's
where I'll be. Thank you.

24:54.848 --> 24:56.257
Mrs. Washington?

25:02.026 --> 25:03.798
Mrs. Washington, My name
is Horatio Caine.

25:03.833 --> 25:07.237
I'm with CSI. I'm sorry for
what happened to Marcus.

25:08.461 --> 25:10.582
He hit the pavement so hard.

25:11.361 --> 25:13.493
The doctor said it's cerebral edema.

25:13.513 --> 25:14.696
I keep talking to him.

25:14.727 --> 25:16.460
I don't know if he can hear me.

25:16.479 --> 25:19.878
Well, Mrs. Washington,
with these things,

25:21.006 --> 25:23.148
it's possible that he can hear you.

25:24.168 --> 25:26.157
Did you find the man
who did this to him?

25:26.187 --> 25:27.758
Well, we're making progress.

25:27.778 --> 25:29.757
And I understand that
you've spoken to officers,

25:29.792 --> 25:31.816
but would you mind telling me the story?

25:32.701 --> 25:35.220
My son takes me to all the games.

25:36.383 --> 25:38.004
It's our tradition.

25:39.450 --> 25:44.682
We were going to the car,
and this man bumped into me.

25:44.824 --> 25:46.578
He was missing every single one!

25:47.423 --> 25:49.126
Hey, man, that's my mom!

25:49.667 --> 25:51.227
What are you doing?

25:52.186 --> 25:53.471
Marcus! Marcus!

25:53.501 --> 25:54.745
Can you hear me?

25:55.288 --> 25:56.318
Help!

25:56.379 --> 25:58.000
Somebody help! Marcus!

25:59.520 --> 26:01.335
Marcus was just watching out for me.

26:01.345 --> 26:02.233
I understand.

26:02.243 --> 26:03.344
Did you get a look at the man?

26:03.364 --> 26:04.945
I was looking at my son.

26:05.714 --> 26:10.425
All I remember is the
blood coming from his nose.

26:13.727 --> 26:14.614
I'm sorry.

26:14.635 --> 26:18.805
Mrs. Washington, there's no
need for you to apologize.

26:19.844 --> 26:23.954
Here's what I want to do. If I find out
anything, I will come and find you, okay?

26:25.249 --> 26:26.615
You hang in there.

26:56.761 --> 26:58.209
Hey.

26:58.434 --> 27:01.442
This is the evidence from
the Marcus Washington assault?

27:02.176 --> 27:04.624
Officer Ramirez got the call.

27:04.642 --> 27:06.967
He clearly remembers
taking Laken's statement.

27:06.977 --> 27:07.926
What is this?

27:08.691 --> 27:09.965
That is...

27:09.986 --> 27:12.535
what's left of a temporary tattoo.

27:12.576 --> 27:13.371
Hmm.

27:16.784 --> 27:19.303
And so this must be the
mother's handkerchief.

27:19.415 --> 27:20.211
Marcus!

27:20.537 --> 27:21.638
Marcus, can you hear me?

27:21.659 --> 27:23.290
Marcus! Marcus!

27:23.641 --> 27:26.445
The rest of it's just napkins
from the Arena parking lot.

27:26.526 --> 27:29.219
Hot dog mustard, relish.

27:29.382 --> 27:30.962
This napkin's interesting.

27:31.705 --> 27:33.194
The fiber's tight.

27:33.602 --> 27:35.020
It's higher grade, you mean.

27:35.040 --> 27:37.202
Tighter weave, like it's more expensive.

27:38.189 --> 27:40.626
Maybe like the kind they
give out in skyboxes?

27:40.667 --> 27:44.104
Richard Laken's statement
said that one of the assailants

27:44.114 --> 27:47.051
knelt next to Marcus
Washington and tended to him.

27:47.788 --> 27:49.929
Hey, man, are you okay?

27:50.164 --> 27:50.918
Marcus!

27:52.927 --> 27:54.375
Marcus!

27:54.577 --> 27:57.433
We should find out which
skybox this napkin comes from.

28:27.099 --> 28:28.771
Did you get anything off the napkin?

28:28.790 --> 28:32.431
Lucky for us, this high-grade
fiber latches onto everything.

28:35.694 --> 28:36.917
What is it?

28:37.593 --> 28:38.827
Take a look.

28:43.263 --> 28:44.925
Some kind of meat?

28:50.273 --> 28:51.619
Spectra's flatlined.

28:51.639 --> 28:52.516
There's nothing on it.

28:52.526 --> 28:53.495
Exactly.

28:53.580 --> 28:58.240
There's no progesterone, estradiol or
any other government approved hormone.

28:58.729 --> 28:59.933
You know what that means?

28:59.953 --> 29:01.044
Meat's foreign.

29:01.054 --> 29:02.166
It's Kobe beef.

29:02.183 --> 29:03.917
Japanese delicacy.

29:04.314 --> 29:07.027
That's an expensive
snack, even for a skybox.

29:07.047 --> 29:09.627
Solar State Insurance
was able to afford it.

29:09.811 --> 29:12.258
Two orders from outside restaurants.

29:12.304 --> 29:14.680
Arena operations confirmed
it over the phone.

29:14.802 --> 29:16.057
Solar State.

29:16.403 --> 29:18.647
Over a thousand employees
and a half million clients.

29:18.657 --> 29:20.605
But only one person signed for it.

29:20.623 --> 29:22.826
They're checking
receipts to get us a name.

29:22.968 --> 29:23.815
Hmm.

29:24.516 --> 29:26.673
I wasn't even at
the Heat game on Saturday.

29:27.961 --> 29:29.101
Is that a fact?

29:29.665 --> 29:32.316
Well, Mr. Hayes, somebody
was, and they... have

29:32.317 --> 29:35.132
the ability to perfectly
reproduce your signature.

29:36.086 --> 29:37.402
The other thing

29:37.437 --> 29:42.637
that we found from your skybox is a
napkin with the victim's blood on it.

29:42.638 --> 29:44.919
What does this mean to you?

29:44.920 --> 29:48.168
The Arena has confirmed there
were only two of you in the skybox,

29:48.169 --> 29:52.970
which makes you either guilty of
aggravated assault or an accomplice.

29:52.971 --> 29:54.458
An accomplice?

29:54.459 --> 29:55.681
To what I don't know yet.

29:55.682 --> 29:59.956
The victim, the victim, Mr.
Hayes, is hanging on by a thread.

29:59.957 --> 30:01.419
No, no, no, no. Wait a minute.

30:01.420 --> 30:02.964
I tried to help that guy.

30:04.445 --> 30:05.655
What are you doing?

30:07.039 --> 30:08.624
Hey, man, are you okay?

30:08.625 --> 30:09.994
Come on! Let's go!

30:10.029 --> 30:10.853
Marcus!

30:13.496 --> 30:14.416
Marcus, can you hear me?

30:14.451 --> 30:15.156
Help!

30:16.211 --> 30:18.012
I need a name.

30:21.282 --> 30:23.584
He's a buddy from work.

30:24.045 --> 30:25.402
Jack Webster.

30:26.157 --> 30:26.885
Look, I...

30:26.920 --> 30:28.501
It happened so fast,

30:28.536 --> 30:30.603
I didn't have time to stop him.

30:30.638 --> 30:32.671
You better pray that I do.

30:34.363 --> 30:36.575
Now, Jack, here's what I think happened.

30:36.610 --> 30:38.753
You and your buddy were up in the skybox

30:38.788 --> 30:42.443
watching the pros bang it
around, feeling your testosterone,

30:42.478 --> 30:45.246
and you punched the first
man that ran in to your path.

30:45.308 --> 30:46.321
Never happened.

30:46.780 --> 30:48.462
Stanton gave you up, Jack.

30:48.756 --> 30:52.130
What? Stanton hit that kid.

30:52.924 --> 30:54.148
I tried to save his life.

30:55.144 --> 30:58.912
So we have a he said/he said.

30:58.947 --> 31:02.400
Jack, do you know that
you're in the minority?

31:02.435 --> 31:03.741
You don't say.

31:03.776 --> 31:05.239
Yes, the minority, Jack.

31:05.274 --> 31:07.733
Only 11% of the country is left-handed.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.193
What makes you think I'm left-handed?

31:10.228 --> 31:11.351
Your ring does.

31:14.196 --> 31:17.172
Marcus had a temporary
tattoo on his face.

31:17.207 --> 31:20.148
It wiped off onto your
ring when you hit him.

31:24.198 --> 31:27.536
You washed your hands,
but neglected your ring.

31:29.085 --> 31:30.290
He started it.

31:31.425 --> 31:32.602
He got in my face.

31:34.094 --> 31:36.254
What was he, what was
he even doing out there?

31:37.770 --> 31:38.787
Hey, man!

31:41.005 --> 31:43.039
Hey, man, you okay?

31:45.466 --> 31:46.579
Come on! Let's go!

31:46.614 --> 31:47.445
Marcus!

31:50.687 --> 31:52.519
He was protecting his mother.

31:52.554 --> 31:55.441
I didn't mean to hurt him that bad.

31:55.476 --> 31:56.856
But you did hurt him that bad.

31:56.891 --> 31:58.582
And Richard Laken saw it.

31:58.617 --> 32:01.951
And he wound up dead
the very next night.

32:02.111 --> 32:03.354
I didn't kill that guy.

32:04.549 --> 32:07.980
Why do you call yourself "Jack
Smith" if you have nothing to hide?

32:08.015 --> 32:09.139
Look...

32:11.628 --> 32:13.896
fake names...

32:13.931 --> 32:17.286
keep the women from calling.

32:19.081 --> 32:21.289
Five minutes and they
think they're engaged.

32:21.324 --> 32:23.498
Have you ever taken a
good look in the mirror?

32:23.533 --> 32:25.185
I didn't even notice that guy.

32:25.220 --> 32:26.816
No, but he noticed you.

32:30.364 --> 32:31.459
Oh, you're one of those.

32:31.494 --> 32:34.068
Probably can't hold your
attention for more five seconds.

32:35.421 --> 32:38.416
If this Richard guy saw me,
why didn't he call the cops?

32:38.451 --> 32:41.630
Maybe he died trying.

32:50.440 --> 32:53.706
There are no cell phones allowed
in the lounge during speed-dating.

32:54.192 --> 32:55.966
So, when Richard recognized Jack,

32:56.001 --> 32:58.461
he had to go to his car, get his
cell phone and call the police.

33:07.957 --> 33:09.935
PD sent over his phone log.

33:11.619 --> 33:14.844
He made no calls last night, so
we can't tell if his phone was on.

33:14.879 --> 33:17.436
Well, actually, we can, with this.

33:18.527 --> 33:19.829
A flash memory chip.

33:19.864 --> 33:22.447
When a cell phone's turned
on, it has to find a network.

33:24.154 --> 33:26.419
So, it sends out a signal
to the nearest cell tower.

33:26.454 --> 33:29.281
The tower sends back

33:29.316 --> 33:33.199
a time-stamped confirmation that can
be retained in the flash memory chip

33:33.234 --> 33:34.769
even when the phone's turned off.

33:36.644 --> 33:38.923
He turned his cell
phone on at 10:56 P.M.

33:38.958 --> 33:41.475
So, he was killed before he
had a chance to make a call.

33:41.510 --> 33:43.001
We have the time of death.

33:43.036 --> 33:46.605
Jack was inside with everyone
else handing in scorecards.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.903
Which means he has 28 alibis.

33:48.938 --> 33:52.916
Which means that whoever killed Richard
Laken was waiting for him outside.

33:53.187 --> 33:55.571
Let's go back to the crime
scene and expand our search.

34:05.534 --> 34:06.808
Hey, Eric.

34:08.123 --> 34:09.443
Will you check this out?

34:14.487 --> 34:17.449
Does this look like
it belongs here to you?

34:21.313 --> 34:22.496
Definitely not.

34:23.301 --> 34:24.911
Looks like caked gravel.

34:24.946 --> 34:26.277
Maybe crushed stone.

34:26.712 --> 34:29.280
But the color's off,
like it's been treated.

34:31.235 --> 34:32.802
It's cast stone.

34:32.837 --> 34:34.292
It's a durable building material.

34:34.327 --> 34:35.746
A list architects use it.

34:35.782 --> 34:38.485
You put the right finish on
it, it looks just like granite.

34:38.520 --> 34:40.822
Cheap contractors must love it.

34:40.858 --> 34:43.650
And I think I know one who
was standing right here.

34:51.687 --> 34:52.679
Pop the trunk.

34:52.714 --> 34:54.139
You guys can't go in there.

34:54.478 --> 34:56.056
Yes, we can. Pop it.

35:10.145 --> 35:12.075
Doing some masonry at the site, Fred?

35:12.595 --> 35:13.655
It's my job.

35:13.690 --> 35:14.715
I'm a builder.

35:25.416 --> 35:26.569
What are you looking at that for?

35:27.071 --> 35:28.880
It might have done
more than change a tire.

35:29.459 --> 35:30.411
You're kidding, right?

35:53.109 --> 35:54.223
We've got blood.

35:54.899 --> 35:57.300
You're under arrest for
the murder of Richard Laken.

35:57.475 --> 35:58.233
Officer...

36:02.437 --> 36:04.854
I was never at this
Neuron Lounge last night.

36:04.889 --> 36:05.970
That's true, Fred.

36:06.005 --> 36:08.076
But you were camped out
across the street from it.

36:19.288 --> 36:21.231
All right, I knew my
wife was seeing some guy.

36:21.266 --> 36:22.495
Didn't you cheat on her?

36:23.058 --> 36:26.610
Yeah, but I still had to know
who got her so hot and bothered.

36:30.360 --> 36:32.676
I'd seen his car once
when he picked her up.

36:44.356 --> 36:45.675
When I saw who it was,

36:45.710 --> 36:47.238
I realized I had nothing to worry about.

36:47.273 --> 36:48.807
The guy was a pencil-neck.

36:48.842 --> 36:50.358
So, I left.

36:50.393 --> 36:54.238
Then how do you explain your tire
iron with Richard Laken's blood on it?

36:54.273 --> 36:56.629
The tool mark matches
his skull fracture.

37:00.643 --> 37:03.405
I can think of one person
who would set me up.

37:04.291 --> 37:07.146
What? Why would I do that?

37:07.181 --> 37:09.436
Perhaps to kill two
birds with one stone.

37:10.560 --> 37:12.025
Or should I say men?

37:14.599 --> 37:18.084
All right, I went out there

37:18.119 --> 37:20.453
at the end of the speed-dating, okay?

37:20.488 --> 37:24.687
I... I wanted to see the look on his
face when he saw what I'd done to his car.

37:34.705 --> 37:35.618
Damn!

37:36.390 --> 37:38.905
How does it feel to expect
one thing and get another?

37:38.940 --> 37:41.019
"I'm sorry." Is that
what you want to hear?

37:50.535 --> 37:52.203
Why didn't you tell me this before?

37:52.696 --> 37:56.017
Well, the last I heard, they didn't
allow child support from prison.

37:56.052 --> 37:57.393
And you never touched Richard?

37:59.985 --> 38:01.771
N... No. Never.

38:01.982 --> 38:04.454
Will you explain his blood...

38:06.228 --> 38:07.358
on your card?

38:24.987 --> 38:26.222
I don't know.

38:26.680 --> 38:29.909
Is it possible that you touched
him before you went back inside?

38:31.615 --> 38:33.752
I... I really, I really couldn't say.

38:33.787 --> 38:34.992
See. the problem I'm having

38:35.027 --> 38:37.707
is that the tire iron you
claimed your husband used

38:38.714 --> 38:40.699
is from your car.

38:42.374 --> 38:43.600
You're trying to trick me

38:43.635 --> 38:44.827
because they're all the same.

38:44.862 --> 38:46.406
Are they? Wolfe?

38:46.441 --> 38:50.737
Diameter of Richard Laken's
skull fracture, 17 millimeters.

38:51.509 --> 38:53.259
It's consistent with your car.

38:53.294 --> 38:57.797
Your husband's SUV needs
a 19-millimeter tire iron.

38:59.408 --> 39:01.307
So, you swapped out your tire iron

39:01.342 --> 39:02.955
to frame your husband.

39:11.439 --> 39:13.506
I just wanted to see his reaction.

39:14.993 --> 39:15.663
Damn it.

39:15.698 --> 39:19.211
He loved that car so i carried
the tire iron for protection.

39:19.246 --> 39:22.170
How does it feel to expect
one thing and get another?

39:22.205 --> 39:23.101
You don't get it.

39:23.136 --> 39:26.134
You women, you think that
that's a dating service?

39:26.169 --> 39:27.290
It's about getting laid.

39:27.325 --> 39:28.045
What?!

39:28.080 --> 39:29.687
You're all in there
looking for a husband.

39:30.599 --> 39:33.736
We're trying to get sex
in less than five minutes.

39:33.771 --> 39:35.254
I thought we had something.

39:35.289 --> 39:37.051
We did. Sex.

39:37.086 --> 39:39.485
You want a husband, go back
to the guy who left you.

39:44.806 --> 39:45.925
The cruelty.

39:46.743 --> 39:48.496
He showed his true colors.

39:48.531 --> 39:50.250
And now we've seen yours.

39:52.891 --> 39:53.878
Thank you, Wolfe.

40:42.401 --> 40:43.642
Lieutenant Caine.

40:44.005 --> 40:44.910
Ma'am.

40:45.655 --> 40:47.870
I heard you found the guy who did this.

40:50.123 --> 40:51.648
You know what, Mrs. Washington?

40:52.730 --> 40:53.969
We did.

40:55.002 --> 40:56.049
We found him.

40:58.645 --> 41:00.973
Marcus squeezed my hand today.

41:02.394 --> 41:03.503
Once.

41:03.538 --> 41:06.649
The doctor said that it
might not mean anything.

41:07.569 --> 41:08.758
Mrs. Washington,

41:08.793 --> 41:11.352
you and I know different, don't we?

41:17.243 --> 41:18.551
Have you had anything to eat?

41:18.586 --> 41:20.904
No, not in days.

41:21.396 --> 41:22.462
You know what?

41:22.497 --> 41:24.173
There's a cafeteria downstairs.

41:24.208 --> 41:25.849
Why don't you get a bite to eat?

41:25.884 --> 41:27.310
Oh, no, I can't go.

41:27.345 --> 41:28.975
Mrs. Washington, you can.

41:29.350 --> 41:30.544
I'll watch Marcus.

41:32.356 --> 41:33.892
You don't mind, Lieutenant?

41:33.927 --> 41:35.125
I'll stay with him.
