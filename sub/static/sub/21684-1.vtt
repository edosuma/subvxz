00:40.040 --> 00:42.843
'You look lovely, Lula!'

00:42.910 --> 00:45.646
'Lula, over here!
Lula, just turn around!'

01:56.083 --> 01:57.718
No, I don't wanna see you again.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.721
* You and me *

04:15.523 --> 04:18.292
* Me and you *

04:18.359 --> 04:23.364
* Somehow we make it through *

04:24.932 --> 04:27.368
* I may be gone *

04:27.435 --> 04:29.737
* I may be far away *

04:31.372 --> 04:34.608
* But I walk beside you *

04:34.675 --> 04:38.712
* Every step of the way *

04:38.779 --> 04:43.250
* When you're used bruised *

04:43.317 --> 04:45.986
* Black and blue *

04:46.053 --> 04:48.689
* Don't think about it *

04:50.324 --> 04:52.826
* Never doubt it *

04:52.893 --> 04:56.364
* I'll walk beside you **

04:57.931 --> 05:01.502
'Doors will open
on the left-hand side.'

05:01.569 --> 05:03.837
'Change for the northern line.'

05:44.778 --> 05:46.780
'Why are you doing this?'

05:46.847 --> 05:48.882
'You know, I can't live
with you anymore.'

05:48.949 --> 05:51.385
'I'd like to be happy
without some psycho'

05:51.452 --> 05:52.986
'making my life
a living misery.'

05:53.053 --> 05:56.123
'
- 'Yeah! Among other things.'

05:56.189 --> 05:57.357
'And where are you going
to sleep next?'

05:57.425 --> 05:58.692
'I don't know.'

05:58.759 --> 06:00.461
'But anywhere
will be better than.. Ah!'

06:00.528 --> 06:02.563
'You mad bitch!'

06:02.630 --> 06:04.164
'You need me. You just watch.'

06:07.568 --> 06:09.369
'Walk away.'

06:13.073 --> 06:14.408
You'll come running back!

06:14.475 --> 06:15.943
You always do!

06:25.786 --> 06:27.387
- Joanna!
- Huh. Oh.

06:35.195 --> 06:36.597
Yeah. Yeah.

06:38.432 --> 06:39.767
Sit down.

06:41.334 --> 06:43.070
- Uh.. Yeah, sorry.

06:43.136 --> 06:46.106
- Sorry about that.
- Oh, it's fine.

06:46.173 --> 06:48.375
- Um..
- 'Yeah.'

06:51.144 --> 06:53.013
Um..

06:53.080 --> 06:54.648
How can I help you?

06:55.215 --> 06:56.416
Oh, um..

06:56.484 --> 06:58.085
Uh, I-I'm the new temp.

06:58.151 --> 07:00.821
- I'm here for the week.
- No, I cancelled that.

07:00.888 --> 07:01.855
Um..

07:01.922 --> 07:03.991
- Definitely.
- Phew!

07:04.057 --> 07:05.358
They're pretty strict
on refunds.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.399
Okay.

07:12.466 --> 07:15.068
I'll just, uh, clear this.

07:16.169 --> 07:17.705
So, do you want me to..

07:19.540 --> 07:21.542
Yeah, just.. You know..

07:25.713 --> 07:27.548
I'll be in my office.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.083
Okay.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.504
- Oh, hi.

08:24.572 --> 08:26.974
Um...my name's John Bristow.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.509
I'd like to speak
to Mr. Strike, if possible.

08:29.577 --> 08:31.545
And do you have an appointment?

08:31.612 --> 08:34.214
Ah. Uh, no. Um..

08:34.281 --> 08:35.616
We know each other.

08:35.683 --> 08:37.551
Well, take a seat, Mr. Bristow.

08:37.618 --> 08:38.886
'Thank you.'

08:44.792 --> 08:46.159
'Yeah?'

08:46.226 --> 08:47.861
Sir.

08:47.928 --> 08:50.898
New client. Mr. John Bristow.

08:50.964 --> 08:53.266
Doesn't have an appointment,
but he says he knows you.

08:55.002 --> 08:57.237
I don't know a John Bristow.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.139
Right.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.841
Well, he says he does.

09:02.242 --> 09:05.045
Two minutes. Uh, could you
shut the door, please?

09:05.112 --> 09:06.113
'Mm-hm.'

09:10.818 --> 09:13.253
Would you like
anything to drink?

09:13.320 --> 09:16.523
'Oh, uh, yeah.
Uh, white coffee, no sugar.'

09:29.202 --> 09:30.270
Uh..

09:32.305 --> 09:34.908
Tsk. Okay.

09:45.452 --> 09:47.921
Um, shall we go through?

09:53.060 --> 09:54.594
Ah. Remember me?

09:55.562 --> 09:56.764
Charlie's brother.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.632
Y-your friend,
Charlie Bristow, from--

09:58.699 --> 10:00.267
John. It's been..

10:02.235 --> 10:03.637
Take a seat.

10:04.772 --> 10:06.073
How's your mother?

10:06.139 --> 10:08.275
After Charlie's accident,
I never really--

10:08.341 --> 10:09.476
Not so good, I'm afraid.

10:09.542 --> 10:11.044
She has stage-four cancer

10:11.111 --> 10:13.080
which has spread
to the lymph nodes.

10:13.146 --> 10:16.549
I'm sorry to hear that.
She was always very kind to me.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.752
I-I remembered that
when I saw your name.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.522
There aren't so many
Cormoran Strikes around.

10:22.589 --> 10:23.791
Yeah.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.694
How can I help you, John?

10:26.760 --> 10:29.362
It's about my sister.

10:29.429 --> 10:32.933
Uh, o-o-of course,
you wouldn't have met, um..

10:33.000 --> 10:37.004
Mum and dad adopted again, about
a year after Charlie's death.

10:37.070 --> 10:39.406
'My sister used
our mother's maiden name'

10:39.472 --> 10:41.975
'for her professional career.'

10:42.042 --> 10:43.711
The world knew her
as Lula Landry.

10:44.812 --> 10:46.313
Thanks, Sandra.

10:48.816 --> 10:50.617
The Lula Landry?

10:50.684 --> 10:52.619
I was with her
earlier that day

10:52.686 --> 10:54.922
to discuss contract.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.323
She had an upcoming shoot
in Morocco.

10:56.389 --> 10:59.259
'She was excited about it.
She was happy.'

11:01.929 --> 11:05.232
Now, the inquest verdict
said suicide.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.902
But I think she was murdered.

11:21.648 --> 11:24.251
Hello. Cormoran Strike's office.

11:24.317 --> 11:26.754
Uh, I'm afraid he's with
a client at the moment.

11:26.820 --> 11:30.157
Yes, of course.
Uh, who should I say called?

11:37.097 --> 11:41.201
Now, a chap
they've picked up on CCTV.

11:41.268 --> 11:42.535
They never traced him.

11:42.602 --> 11:46.173
He was outside watching the
flat. Looks like a black chap.

11:46.239 --> 11:49.442
Uh, not that, well, you know,
you know, just, it..

11:51.745 --> 11:53.246
We haven't got
the actual footage?

11:53.313 --> 11:55.415
No, just those stills.

11:55.482 --> 11:58.418
But it is my priority
to find out who he is.

11:59.619 --> 12:01.488
It's all set out in there.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.357
'Uh, my own analysis, plus
a lot of the police evidence'

12:04.424 --> 12:07.027
which I obtained
during the inquest.

12:07.094 --> 12:10.097
The inquest that returned
a verdict of suicide?

12:10.163 --> 12:11.698
Because the coroner
couldn't see past

12:11.765 --> 12:13.600
a girl with a poor history
of mental health.

12:13.666 --> 12:15.168
Hm.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.004
Look.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.939
Review the information
in the file

12:19.006 --> 12:21.041
ask some questions..

12:21.108 --> 12:24.311
...then we can discuss
any further involvement.

12:27.380 --> 12:31.018
That's a 1000 pounds
just to do that.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.553
'Look, even if it's just
to put our minds at rest'

12:33.620 --> 12:37.925
while mum's still alive, a-a-and
stop this horrible anxiety

12:37.991 --> 12:40.193
that justice has not been done.

12:43.196 --> 12:45.632
'Charlie never wanted to let me
play football with you guys.'

12:45.698 --> 12:47.134
Do you remember?

12:47.200 --> 12:49.937
'A-and you always said,
"Oh, let him tag along.'

12:50.003 --> 12:51.238
'He could be ballboy."'

12:52.772 --> 12:55.375
'As a friend of our family..'

12:55.442 --> 12:57.677
'...you're exactly
the right person.'

12:57.744 --> 12:59.880
Please don't say no.

13:04.985 --> 13:08.421
'You know, I can only promise to
review the file at this stage.'

13:08.488 --> 13:09.622
'Of course.'

13:09.689 --> 13:11.724
We'll, uh, speak later.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.260
See you, John.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.502
Thanks for
sortin' the coffee, Sandra.

13:22.569 --> 13:23.736
Oh, that's alright.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.072
Uh, Mr. Gillespie called.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.174
'He said it was important.'

13:29.642 --> 13:31.244
Why do you keep
calling me Sandra?

13:33.313 --> 13:35.182
- No.

13:36.249 --> 13:38.085
The last girl was called Sandra.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.987
Ah.

13:40.053 --> 13:41.188
I accept that isn't
a brilliant reason

13:41.254 --> 13:43.123
for me calling you by her name.

13:44.124 --> 13:46.126
I'm Robin. Robin Ellacott.

13:46.193 --> 13:48.962
Cormoran. Just poppin' out.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.698
Um, where shall I say you are,
if anyone important calls?

13:51.764 --> 13:54.567
Down the boozer.
Don't worry, they won't.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.939
Um, so is there anything
in particular

13:59.006 --> 14:00.107
you'd like me to do
while you're gone?

14:00.173 --> 14:01.174
Uh, could you look up

14:01.241 --> 14:02.709
Landry, May, and Patterson?

14:02.775 --> 14:03.743
They're a law firm.

14:03.810 --> 14:05.012
Print out their partner biogs

14:05.078 --> 14:06.479
and, uh, and if you can get on

14:06.546 --> 14:08.281
Lula Landry's
family background..

14:08.348 --> 14:09.449
Mm-hm.

14:09.516 --> 14:13.420
Uh, the computer password's
Hatherill123.

14:13.486 --> 14:14.487
Two L's.

14:19.326 --> 14:21.261
Sorry about
nearly killing you earlier.

14:22.395 --> 14:23.563
It's okay.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.210
Hiya, Corm.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.612
Is that a new girl
in your office?

14:39.679 --> 14:42.049
Well, she came down
to borrow some coffee stuff.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.683
Roger was all over her
like a cheap suit.

14:43.750 --> 14:46.219
Tell Roger she has
a massive engagement ring.

14:46.286 --> 14:48.288
Yeah, like that'll stop him
from trying.

14:48.355 --> 14:49.990
Huh.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.624
What happened to your, uh..

14:51.691 --> 14:52.926
I got smacked with an ashtray.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.594
- 'Ouch.'
- Yeah.

15:32.899 --> 15:34.367
- Pint.
- 'Yeah.'

15:44.411 --> 15:45.412
Oh.

16:28.321 --> 16:31.224
Yeah, the Lula Landry case.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.426
Who's the investigatin' officer?

17:40.627 --> 17:43.263
- My name is Cormoran Strike.

17:43.330 --> 17:45.265
I wondered if we could have
a quick chat.

17:45.332 --> 17:47.767
Even when she's dead,
you lot don't give up.

17:47.834 --> 17:50.370
- I'm not a journalist.
So, what are you then?

17:50.437 --> 17:52.305
- You're not acop.
- I was.

17:52.372 --> 17:54.374
Royal Military Police.

17:54.441 --> 17:55.975
I'm now a private investigator.

17:56.042 --> 17:57.444
Right.

17:57.510 --> 18:00.113
Hacking phones for a living.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.048
Dishonorable discharge, was it?

18:02.115 --> 18:04.884
Medical. My leg.

18:04.951 --> 18:06.386
Want to see it?

18:06.853 --> 18:08.888
No.

18:08.955 --> 18:10.257
Lula's family have hired me

18:10.323 --> 18:11.958
to investigate the efficiency

18:12.024 --> 18:14.294
of the police investigation.

18:14.361 --> 18:16.496
Were you working
the night she died?

18:18.131 --> 18:21.134
- First to the body.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.903
Mrs. Bestigui,
she's on the first floor

18:23.970 --> 18:25.405
she runs down screaming, and..

18:25.472 --> 18:27.674
Somebody had just
fallen past their window.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.276
I run out, and..

18:31.178 --> 18:34.281
- Horrible.

18:34.347 --> 18:35.848
I went straight up
to Lula's flat.

18:35.915 --> 18:37.049
Why would you do that?

18:37.116 --> 18:38.685
'Cause of what Mrs. Bestigui
was sayin'..

18:38.751 --> 18:41.388
...she thought there was
somebody there, so..

18:41.454 --> 18:44.757
You'd know if anybody
had gone up, presumably?

18:46.092 --> 18:47.627
Yeah.

18:47.694 --> 18:48.961
Oh, excuse me.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.172
Ah. Dennis.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.573
I need to show you
that lift door.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.575
- Come in--
- It's Derrick.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.477
Derrick. Sorry.

19:04.544 --> 19:06.413
'Certainly, Mr. Bestigui.'

19:08.080 --> 19:11.418
Actually, uh,
you should talk to Nico.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.320
'He was Lula's favorite driver.'

19:18.291 --> 19:20.393
I got a pickup in Greek Street,
you know?

19:20.460 --> 19:23.563
Well, I'm going that way.
Half the fare?

19:24.897 --> 19:26.566
Yeah, okay. Hop in.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.008
Delivery
from Charlotte Campbell.

19:36.075 --> 19:37.410
Oh. Careful.

19:37.477 --> 19:40.046
I'm on a double yellow, love.

19:54.294 --> 19:55.628
'It's sad.'

19:55.695 --> 19:58.298
Yeah, Lula.
She was alright, you know?

19:58.365 --> 20:00.833
She had a big heart.

20:00.900 --> 20:04.637
And she lived in a world
that's really fuckin' hard.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.673
- 'We had a lot in common.'

20:06.739 --> 20:08.508
'Uh, both mixed race,
for one thing.'

20:08.575 --> 20:10.743
My dad's a Cypriot
from, uh, Swansea

20:10.810 --> 20:12.879
and my mum's
a West Indian Scouser.

20:12.945 --> 20:14.614
Must've been
a nice quiet wedding.

20:16.683 --> 20:18.184
Whoa, whoa, you've still gotta

20:18.251 --> 20:20.820
follow the rules of the road
even if you are on a bike, love.

20:21.988 --> 20:23.756
Where did you take her that day?

20:23.823 --> 20:26.359
Uh, okay, so first off,
we went to Vashti.

20:26.426 --> 20:28.295
It's a clothes shop
on Conduit Street.

20:28.361 --> 20:30.463
- '"Vashti."'
- 'They was in there for a bit.'

20:30.530 --> 20:31.998
'And then I took them
back to Lula's.'

20:32.064 --> 20:33.366
"
- 'Yeah.'

20:33.433 --> 20:35.067
'She met a mate in there.'

20:35.134 --> 20:37.003
- 'Rochelle.'

20:37.069 --> 20:38.505
'Rochelle Onifade.'

20:38.571 --> 20:40.373
Lula met her in a nuthouse.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.941
I used to pick her up
from her hostel

20:42.008 --> 20:44.644
'on, uh, Hallam Street
and bring her out to play.'

20:44.711 --> 20:46.746
Can you remember
what they were talkin' about?

20:46.813 --> 20:48.981
- Like, anything.

20:50.850 --> 20:52.885
Uh, they was lookin'
at something for a bit..

20:52.952 --> 20:55.154
Some piece of paper.

20:55.221 --> 20:57.123
'You don't remember
what it was?'

20:57.189 --> 20:58.625
All I remember
is Lula laughin'

20:58.691 --> 21:01.728
and sayin' it was gonna
piss people off big-time.

22:07.560 --> 22:08.861
Anstis?

22:10.129 --> 22:11.998
Any luck with DI Wardle, mate?

22:16.168 --> 22:18.070
Yeah, if you could.

22:18.137 --> 22:19.939
Yeah, that would be great.

22:21.240 --> 22:22.709
Yeah. Sure.

22:23.309 --> 22:24.544
Yeah. Bye.

23:59.972 --> 24:03.876
People have been coming all day
to pay tribute to Lula Landry

24:03.943 --> 24:07.146
who fell to her death
from one of the flats behind..

24:10.517 --> 24:11.651
How'd it go today, then?

24:11.718 --> 24:13.219
Well, when I got there

24:13.285 --> 24:14.453
the boss had obviously been

24:14.521 --> 24:16.789
in a massive fight
with some woman.

24:16.856 --> 24:18.357
The office is all smashed up

24:18.424 --> 24:19.892
and he doesn't
want me there at all.

24:19.959 --> 24:22.729
And then,
he buggers off to the pub

24:22.795 --> 24:24.363
'and leaves me on my own
all afternoon'

24:24.430 --> 24:25.665
with this really rude guy

24:25.732 --> 24:27.433
calling every half hour
demanding money.

24:27.500 --> 24:28.568
So it's just him, then?

24:28.635 --> 24:29.936
Yeah, he's a private detective.

24:31.203 --> 24:33.205
Private detective?

24:33.272 --> 24:34.807
That's a bit Roger Rabbit.

24:37.710 --> 24:39.979
It's n-not, actually.

24:40.046 --> 24:41.113
He's, um..

24:43.449 --> 24:45.251
His dad's Jonny Rokeby.

24:46.152 --> 24:47.587
- Mm.

24:47.654 --> 24:49.889
- I don't know.

24:49.956 --> 24:51.357
From what I read online,
they don't have

24:51.423 --> 24:52.859
much of a relationship.

24:56.295 --> 24:58.798
'Isn't that the model
who jumped out of a window?'

25:01.233 --> 25:02.935
Gosh.

25:03.002 --> 25:05.471
'She was so young
and beautiful.'

25:05.538 --> 25:07.974
Girls always get
other girls wrong.

25:08.040 --> 25:11.778
You are miles better lookin'.
She's way too skinny.

25:23.389 --> 25:27.293
'That'll be an Arsenal throw,
down this left-hand side.'

25:34.667 --> 25:38.470
'Yeah, it was a touch and go,
wasn't it? It had so much..'

25:44.376 --> 25:47.013
'You know, he should be walking,
chasing, walking, chasing.'

25:47.079 --> 25:49.215
'They've only just gotta try
and get back in the game.'

25:52.985 --> 25:54.153
Night.

25:58.991 --> 25:59.959
Matt!

26:00.026 --> 26:00.860
'They..'

26:00.927 --> 26:02.962
...destroy communication.

26:03.029 --> 26:04.130
Mm-hm.

26:06.132 --> 26:07.600
And intimacy.

26:39.065 --> 26:41.367
- 'It's DI Wardle here.'

26:41.433 --> 26:44.403
'I've just come off my shift.'

26:44.470 --> 26:47.473
'You can have half an hour
if you get your skates on.'

26:47.539 --> 26:48.708
Great.

26:51.610 --> 26:54.046
So you think
Lula Landry was murdered

26:54.113 --> 26:55.748
and we messed up
the investigation?

26:55.815 --> 26:58.250
Not at all, I just wanna have
a better picture

26:58.317 --> 26:59.786
of Lula's last hours.

27:01.587 --> 27:02.889
Well, we know she was in a state

27:02.955 --> 27:05.057
because of the latest bust-up
with her boyfriend.

27:05.124 --> 27:07.226
Evan Duffield. He was seen
outside the bar where--

27:07.293 --> 27:08.728
Well, he was seen
all over the place

27:08.795 --> 27:10.863
with that stupid wolf head.

27:12.198 --> 27:15.134
But he has a cast-iron alibi
for time of death.

27:15.201 --> 27:18.404
Let's make this
nice and clear.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.072
Lula enters the lobby alone

27:20.139 --> 27:21.774
she says goodnight
to the concierge

27:21.841 --> 27:24.010
and heads upstairs.
Nobody followed her.

27:24.076 --> 27:26.178
And there's no other way
up to her flat.

27:26.245 --> 27:28.347
Underneath Lula's,
there's flat two

27:28.414 --> 27:30.883
a rental property. Empty.

27:30.950 --> 27:33.019
Well, Deeby Macc was meant
to arrive that night

27:33.085 --> 27:34.921
but diverts to Claridge's
from the airport.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.288
Who is Deeby Macc?

27:37.456 --> 27:39.325
'He's a pretty famous rapper.'

27:39.391 --> 27:40.893
And believe me

27:40.960 --> 27:43.029
his entourage and
credit card limit are big enough

27:43.095 --> 27:45.631
to make trackin' him,
well, fairly easy.

27:45.698 --> 27:48.400
- Hm.
- On the first floor, flat one.

27:48.467 --> 27:50.469
The Bestiguis,
Freddie and Tansy.

27:50.536 --> 27:51.738
He's on a conference call

27:51.804 --> 27:54.140
and there's six witnesses
to that effect.

27:54.206 --> 27:56.876
She's in a nightie and sees
a body fall past the window

27:56.943 --> 27:57.910
and raises the alarm.

27:57.977 --> 27:59.445
With the concierge.

27:59.511 --> 28:00.947
He told me Tansy said

28:01.013 --> 28:02.314
she had heard
an argument upstairs

28:02.381 --> 28:03.816
that's why he ran up
to check it out.

28:03.883 --> 28:05.885
By the time it came
to her official statement

28:05.952 --> 28:09.355
Tansy Bestigui
had reverted to the fact.

28:10.422 --> 28:11.657
She was coked up.

28:11.724 --> 28:13.726
It might have altered
her perceptions a bit.

28:16.863 --> 28:18.530
'You think
I wouldn't have liked'

28:18.597 --> 28:22.601
to head up the Lula Landry
murder investigation?

28:22.668 --> 28:25.704
Well, sometimes,
the truth is boring.

28:25.772 --> 28:27.974
A girl with mental health
issues, a pressure job

28:28.040 --> 28:30.242
and boyfriend trouble,
topped herself.

28:33.045 --> 28:34.513
'My advice would be'

28:34.580 --> 28:37.016
take whatever that arsehole
brother's already given you

28:37.083 --> 28:39.151
and get back to sniffin' sheets.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.217
Mornin'.

29:12.184 --> 29:13.519
Morning.

29:13.585 --> 29:16.856
I need you to prepare some terms
and conditions for John Bristow

29:16.923 --> 29:18.424
and create a client account,
please.

29:18.490 --> 29:20.292
- Yeah.

29:20.359 --> 29:22.995
The woman who raised the alarm
said she heard a fight upstairs

29:23.062 --> 29:25.631
and then she changed
her statement.

29:25.697 --> 29:27.666
Hm. Why would she do that?

29:27.733 --> 29:29.201
'Well, that's a good question.'

29:29.268 --> 29:33.105
'And one DI Wardle
was all too happy to dismiss.'

29:33.172 --> 29:34.473
'I suspect he suffers from'

29:34.540 --> 29:36.608
'acute confirmation bias,
which means--'

29:36.675 --> 29:39.145
Preferring evidence that
supports a preexisting theory

29:39.211 --> 29:41.113
and ignoring that which doesn't.

29:43.916 --> 29:46.352
Yeah, I-I did it at UNI.

29:46.418 --> 29:49.421
- No. Dropped out.

29:51.190 --> 29:52.291
Me, too.

29:53.459 --> 29:54.226
What's all this?

29:54.293 --> 29:57.129
So...the last photos of Lula.

29:57.196 --> 29:59.165
'These are all pictures
taken at the funeral.'

29:59.231 --> 30:01.567
This is the family,
that's Lady Yvette Bristow

30:01.633 --> 30:03.035
'with her brother, Tony Landry.'

30:03.102 --> 30:04.636
John and Lula's uncle.

30:04.703 --> 30:05.872
'Who is also a partner'

30:05.938 --> 30:06.906
'at the law firm.'

30:06.973 --> 30:08.074
So I've printed off his biog

30:08.140 --> 30:09.475
for you, as well.

30:11.477 --> 30:13.045
'These are industry people
and friends.'

30:13.112 --> 30:14.746
This is GuySome, the designer

30:14.813 --> 30:17.216
'with Lula's best mate,
Ciara Porter.'

30:17.283 --> 30:19.051
- 'Evan Duffield.'
- 'Rock star boyfriend.'

30:19.118 --> 30:22.288
'And this is the big film
producer, Freddie Bestigui'

30:22.354 --> 30:25.057
'who lives on the first floor
of Lula's building.'

30:25.124 --> 30:26.592
'I'm guessing
that's his wife.'

30:26.658 --> 30:29.862
That's Tansy, the neighbor
who changed her statement.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.067
I'm heading to Lula's now.

30:35.134 --> 30:36.969
Do you want to
look around with me?

30:38.570 --> 30:39.605
Sure.

30:41.507 --> 30:43.910
Have you ever heard
of Deeby Macc?

30:45.077 --> 30:47.213
- Yeah.
- Well, I hadn't.

30:48.915 --> 30:51.450
Actually, he had a big thing
for Lula Landry.

30:51.517 --> 30:54.020
Wrote a couple of tracks
about how he was gonna

30:54.086 --> 30:56.022
take her off Evan Duffield.

30:56.088 --> 30:58.557
- No.

30:58.624 --> 31:01.293
Obviously, it was a matter to be
sorted out between the boys.

31:02.828 --> 31:03.795
Why?

31:03.862 --> 31:04.964
He was gonna rent the flat

31:05.031 --> 31:07.866
underneath Lula's,
for his UK tour.

31:17.776 --> 31:20.246
Did John Bristow call you
about the key?

31:21.813 --> 31:24.516
So this is where you were
the night of Lula's death?

31:24.583 --> 31:25.684
Yeah.

31:25.751 --> 31:26.718
Nobody comes or goes

31:26.785 --> 31:28.154
without you seeing, right?

31:28.220 --> 31:29.355
- Yeah.
- I mean..

31:29.421 --> 31:31.190
They'd have to report to you?

31:31.257 --> 31:33.492
'Yeah, I tell them
what flat to go up to.'

31:33.559 --> 31:36.228
Unless Lula's told me
not to let them up.

31:36.295 --> 31:39.331
- Well, a couple of times.

31:39.398 --> 31:42.601
- Evan Duffield, mostly.

31:43.802 --> 31:46.005
'And her uncle, Tony Landry.'

31:46.072 --> 31:48.074
'If they've had
one of their rows.'

31:49.875 --> 31:51.110
Okay.

31:53.345 --> 31:56.082
'So, tell me
about the building's layout.'

31:56.148 --> 31:58.650
'Well, the Bestiguis
are on the first floor'

31:58.717 --> 32:01.920
'and the second floor
is currently vacant.'

32:01.988 --> 32:04.790
'The penthouse was Lula's.'

32:04.856 --> 32:07.059
'And this is the only entrance?'

32:07.126 --> 32:08.627
'Only one way in and out.'

32:46.065 --> 32:48.700
Why do you think she got changed
when she got home?

32:48.767 --> 32:50.469
Comfort?

32:50.536 --> 32:53.305
Funny thing to do when
you're about to kill yourself.

32:53.372 --> 32:56.108
In the army,
I knew this lieutenant.

32:56.175 --> 32:59.211
'Life and soul
of his own birthday party.'

32:59.278 --> 33:01.580
Shot himself two hours later.

34:13.785 --> 34:15.721
Locks as soon as it's shut.

34:21.793 --> 34:23.462
Don't think he can hear me.

34:32.338 --> 34:33.905
You can't hear a single thing
from these flats

34:33.972 --> 34:35.741
with the doors shut.

34:35.807 --> 34:38.244
They can have
a Trenchtown sound system

34:38.310 --> 34:40.346
playing downstairs

34:40.412 --> 34:42.181
and you'd never know.

34:42.248 --> 34:43.682
What's Tansy Bestigui like?

34:43.749 --> 34:45.217
'Better than her husband.'

34:45.284 --> 34:46.685
You believed her when she said

34:46.752 --> 34:48.754
she thought there was somebody
up here with Lula?

34:50.122 --> 34:51.457
She was scared.

34:52.191 --> 34:53.392
'Okay.'

34:53.459 --> 34:55.361
'What about Rochelle Onifade?'

34:55.427 --> 34:58.664
Nico said he dropped them both
back here during the day.

34:58.730 --> 35:01.433
'I told Lula about that girl.'

35:01.500 --> 35:03.435
'
- That she was trash.

35:03.502 --> 35:05.904
- 'Only after her money.'

35:05.971 --> 35:09.141
Just laughed.
And told me not to be horrible.

35:09.208 --> 35:11.177
She doesn't care about money.

35:11.243 --> 35:14.112
Only people with a lot of it
ever say that.

35:14.180 --> 35:15.781
Do you mind showing me
the rest of the building?

35:15.847 --> 35:18.016
Oh, well, there's only
the swimming pool, really

35:18.083 --> 35:19.751
'so I don't know
why you'd wanna..'

35:49.215 --> 35:50.516
'Mrs. Bestigui?'

35:52.017 --> 35:54.353
My name is Cormoran Strike.

35:54.420 --> 35:56.722
I'm an investigator.

35:56.788 --> 35:59.825
- 'A private investigator.'

35:59.891 --> 36:02.127
'Sorry to bother you,
but I've been hired'

36:02.194 --> 36:04.596
'to look into the death
of Lula Landry.'

36:04.663 --> 36:06.432
I just need to ask you
a few questions

36:06.498 --> 36:08.434
about the night of Lula's death.

36:09.801 --> 36:11.203
Yes?

36:11.270 --> 36:13.672
How did you know Lula fell?

36:13.739 --> 36:15.374
- I saw her.

36:15.441 --> 36:16.908
That's what I said.

36:19.010 --> 36:21.747
So you were close to the window?

36:24.650 --> 36:26.084
I'm sorry.

36:26.151 --> 36:27.519
This really isn't a great time

36:27.586 --> 36:29.588
for this kind of conversation.

36:32.324 --> 36:33.792
Please, uh..

36:35.026 --> 36:36.595
Just..

36:36.662 --> 36:38.797
'...call my office
and fix a meeting.'

36:38.864 --> 36:42.434
I just want to ensure
we've got all the facts.

36:43.402 --> 36:44.903
Who's paying you?

36:44.970 --> 36:47.606
John Bristow, Lula's brother.

36:49.908 --> 36:50.876
Okay.

36:52.077 --> 36:53.412
I'll call you.

37:02.388 --> 37:04.723
- She's lying.

37:04.790 --> 37:06.525
When you start
an investigation, Robin

37:06.592 --> 37:10.228
it's like looking into
an aquarium for the first time.

37:10.296 --> 37:12.798
Walk around,
check how many fish there are.

37:12.864 --> 37:14.833
See what happens
when you tap the glass.

37:14.900 --> 37:18.103
And, right now, Tansy's
the most interesting fish?

37:18.169 --> 37:20.372
And Rochelle Onifade.

37:22.140 --> 37:23.409
* If you keep dancin' on me *

37:23.475 --> 37:24.976
* Girl I'd be tempted to touch *

37:25.043 --> 37:26.578
* Tempted to touch *
* Whoa *

37:26.645 --> 37:28.447
* Tempted to touch
tempted to touch *

37:28.514 --> 37:30.215
* Feel like I can't get enough

37:30.282 --> 37:31.617
* Can't get enough
* Whoa *

37:31.683 --> 37:33.118
* If you keep dancin' on me *

37:33.184 --> 37:34.152
* Girl I'd be tempted to touch *

37:34.219 --> 37:36.087
So this is Deeby Macc.

37:36.154 --> 37:38.357
* Tempted to touch
tempted to touch *

37:38.424 --> 37:39.825
* Don't like bein' alone
in this club *

37:39.891 --> 37:41.527
* Alone in this club *
* Whoa *

37:41.593 --> 37:42.828
* If you keep hitting on me **

37:42.894 --> 37:44.262
Right.

37:44.330 --> 37:46.398
And I also found out
that Ciara Porter

37:46.465 --> 37:48.434
has a web channel of video clips

37:48.500 --> 37:50.436
she made with Lula
and her mates.

37:50.502 --> 37:51.603
Oh, we should call her Beulah!

37:51.670 --> 37:53.305
Oh, my God,
it's a she and I am not..

37:53.372 --> 37:55.974
'Ciara's just got a new dog.'

37:56.041 --> 37:59.177
- With stupid ears.
- Expensive ears.

37:59.244 --> 38:01.012
Rochelle!

38:01.079 --> 38:03.148
They shouldn't breed 'em
flat-faced like that.

38:03.214 --> 38:05.751
- Poor things.
- Hello. Hello.

38:05.817 --> 38:08.253
- No, no, no. It's okay.
- Pause it there.

38:08.320 --> 38:10.322
Oh, my Little Rock!

38:12.691 --> 38:15.026
Where are those funeral photos
you showed me?

38:17.028 --> 38:18.063
Um..

38:26.938 --> 38:28.039
Is that Rochelle?

38:29.675 --> 38:30.742
Yeah.

38:42.421 --> 38:43.955
Think that could be Rochelle?

38:45.524 --> 38:47.693
Oh. Well, it's hard to say.

38:47.759 --> 38:49.361
'It could be.'

38:51.897 --> 38:53.632
'Cormoran Strike's office.'

38:54.833 --> 38:57.736
'Yes, of course.
I'll pass that on immediately.'

38:59.004 --> 39:01.673
'Tansy Bestigui
wants to meet you tonight.'

39:02.974 --> 39:03.942
Hm.

39:06.111 --> 39:07.579
'I'll go and iron a shirt.'

39:11.983 --> 39:13.284
Here's my Little Rock.

39:13.351 --> 39:15.286
My Little Rock
knows more about me

39:15.353 --> 39:17.355
than you lot ever will.

39:44.149 --> 39:46.918
- 'Good evening.'
- I'm meeting Tansy Bestigui.

39:46.985 --> 39:48.987
Sure.
May we take your coat, sir?

40:08.239 --> 40:09.541
This isn't..

40:09.608 --> 40:11.309
My name is Tony Landry.

40:11.376 --> 40:13.411
I'm Lula and John's uncle.

40:14.446 --> 40:15.747
'Please sit down.'

40:20.552 --> 40:23.489
Coincidentally,
our law firm also represents

40:23.555 --> 40:26.625
Mr. and Mrs. Bestigui.

40:26.692 --> 40:28.627
So now,
I've been looking you up.

40:28.694 --> 40:30.328
All very interesting.

40:30.395 --> 40:33.899
Afghanistan. Jonny Rokeby.

40:35.433 --> 40:38.236
And your mother.

40:38.303 --> 40:40.138
Leda Strike, wasn't it?

40:40.205 --> 40:43.942
'They don't make them like her
anymore, unfortunately.'

40:45.611 --> 40:48.614
And now, my delusional nephew
has hired you

40:48.680 --> 40:51.282
to cause more pain
to the family.

40:51.349 --> 40:53.251
My aim is to lessen his pain

40:53.318 --> 40:54.820
by providing him with the truth.

40:54.886 --> 40:58.223
I can't interfere
with my nephew's madness.

40:58.289 --> 41:01.793
- Or his love for his sister.
- Very true.

41:01.860 --> 41:04.863
Family is a complex thing.

41:04.930 --> 41:08.133
You of all people
are surely aware of that.

41:08.199 --> 41:10.502
'Lula's death was tragic.'

41:10.569 --> 41:12.170
'But I must advise you'

41:12.237 --> 41:16.174
to stay away from the Bestiguis.

41:17.909 --> 41:22.013
'
- Delicious. Thank you.

41:22.080 --> 41:24.115
'I would like a bottle
of the Puligny-Montrachet.'

41:24.182 --> 41:28.319
- And, please, not too cold.
- 'Of course, sir.'

41:28.386 --> 41:29.988
The thing is, Tony..

41:30.055 --> 41:32.858
...I take my instructions
from your nephew, so..

41:32.924 --> 41:34.059
They say..

41:35.193 --> 41:36.294
...that we are all

41:36.361 --> 41:38.764
just two mistakes away
from being homeless.

41:38.830 --> 41:42.033
And I know that currently,
my nephew's money

41:42.100 --> 41:46.037
is all that is keeping you
from displaying that stump..

41:46.104 --> 41:49.040
...for loose change
on the Waterloo Bridge.

41:50.475 --> 41:51.843
'Put John's mind at rest.'

41:51.910 --> 41:54.780
Ease his pain, if you like.

41:54.846 --> 41:57.949
Take your money,
and we'll all be happy.

41:58.684 --> 42:00.451
Don't be greedy, though

42:00.518 --> 42:03.989
and take advantage of his grief
by prolonging this tragedy

42:04.055 --> 42:07.158
or I will tie you
in so many legal knots

42:07.225 --> 42:10.629
'you won't be able to get
out of bed in the morning.'

42:12.631 --> 42:14.700
Definitely give that
some thought.

42:16.067 --> 42:18.770
Let me give you
a little bit of advice.

42:18.837 --> 42:21.006
You can insult
my financial status

42:21.072 --> 42:23.108
my disability,
anything you like.

42:24.643 --> 42:27.012
Mention my mother again..

42:27.078 --> 42:29.480
...I'll introduce you
to an experience far worse

42:29.547 --> 42:32.250
than an over-chilled burgundy.

42:32.317 --> 42:34.352
Got it?

42:34.419 --> 42:35.954
Enjoy the rest of your dinner.

43:13.524 --> 43:16.494
'You've reached the offices
of Cormoran Strike.'

43:16.561 --> 43:18.363
'Please leave a message.'

43:19.931 --> 43:22.300
'I know you're there.'

43:22.367 --> 43:24.803
'Just pick up the phone.'

43:26.805 --> 43:28.339
'I can't cope.'

43:29.708 --> 43:31.710
'I need you, bluey.'

43:32.644 --> 43:33.645
'Please.'

43:55.266 --> 43:56.401
Bollocks.

43:58.403 --> 43:59.570
Why do I always take you off

43:59.637 --> 44:01.272
before I remember
to have a piss?

46:04.462 --> 46:06.131
Yeah?

46:06.197 --> 46:09.134
The, um, the stuff for
John Bristow you asked for.

46:11.236 --> 46:12.871
Would you like me
to get rid of that cup?

46:12.938 --> 46:15.606
No! No.

46:15.673 --> 46:17.142
You're not a cleaner.

46:17.775 --> 46:18.977
Okay.

46:54.846 --> 46:56.915
- Tashakor.
- Nooshe jan.

47:08.459 --> 47:10.561
Sorry, I'm a bit late.

47:10.628 --> 47:12.230
Couldn't find anywhere to park.

47:12.297 --> 47:15.133
Had to use the, uh,
Chinatown car park.

47:19.037 --> 47:20.872
Look, um..

47:20.939 --> 47:24.943
I am so relieved
you've agreed to take this on.

47:25.010 --> 47:27.012
Here are my terms of business.

47:27.078 --> 47:28.746
Daily rate includes money
for informants

47:28.813 --> 47:30.515
and incidentals, and..

47:35.453 --> 47:36.888
Here's some issues
and questions.

47:36.955 --> 47:38.189
Alright.

47:41.126 --> 47:43.428
Yeah.
L-Lula did have a computer.

47:43.494 --> 47:45.730
Uh, but we wiped it
and gave it to charity

47:45.796 --> 47:47.332
once the police had returned it.

47:49.434 --> 47:51.636
Was there anything else
taken from her flat?

47:51.702 --> 47:53.271
Uh, Tony took mum around there

47:53.338 --> 47:55.240
uh, just to pick up
a few personal things.

47:55.306 --> 47:57.775
- Yeah.

47:57.842 --> 47:59.177
Hm.

48:00.311 --> 48:02.647
- I bumped into him.

48:02.713 --> 48:04.449
Or rather, he bumped into me.

48:07.318 --> 48:09.220
How do you get on with him?

48:09.287 --> 48:11.722
Tony's a little, uh..

48:11.789 --> 48:13.258
Yeah.

48:14.392 --> 48:15.493
Lula?

48:16.361 --> 48:18.496
Uh, they sometimes clashed.

48:18.563 --> 48:21.899
The doorman told me she asked
him not to let Tony up.

48:21.967 --> 48:24.970
Yep, I-I can believe that.

48:25.036 --> 48:28.473
Did Lula ever mention
Rochelle Onifade?

48:28.539 --> 48:31.476
- No.

48:33.078 --> 48:34.980
So I'm afraid, uh..

48:35.046 --> 48:36.481
Rochelle..

48:36.547 --> 48:39.384
'No, I-I-I'm sorry,
I can't put a face to her.'

48:48.493 --> 48:49.961
Fiver for a hand job.

48:53.431 --> 48:55.100
Rochelle's not here anymore.

48:55.166 --> 48:56.934
She was asked to leave,
actually.

48:57.002 --> 48:59.537
- No, sorry.

48:59.604 --> 49:01.272
You don't have
any contact details?

49:01.339 --> 49:04.542
Yeah, but I can't just give them
out to strangers, obviously.

49:07.778 --> 49:10.648
'Hallam Street Hostel. Yup.'

49:12.950 --> 49:14.419
'No, we haven't got any places.'

49:14.485 --> 49:18.156
'You have to be resident
in the borough for B and B.'

49:18.223 --> 49:21.192
'Yes, it is a disgrace.
Welcome to London.'

49:22.593 --> 49:25.696
Okay, thanks.
Sorry to bother you.

49:49.120 --> 49:52.090
- No.

49:52.157 --> 49:55.293
Could you do me a big favor
for 50 quid?

49:57.362 --> 49:59.530
Thought you wouldn't
be able to resist.

49:59.597 --> 50:02.433
- It's not that kind of favor.

50:24.489 --> 50:25.623
Yeah.

50:48.679 --> 50:51.282
Might not be a big deal to you,
but I'm proper phobic!

50:51.349 --> 50:53.251
It was an enormous,
big hairy monster.

50:53.318 --> 50:55.286
- Nearly as bad as him.

50:55.353 --> 50:57.455
There's a bloody spider
in her room.

51:00.825 --> 51:03.228
I need you to call Rochelle,
tell her a friend of Lula's

51:03.294 --> 51:05.296
needs to meet to give her
an important message.

51:10.034 --> 51:11.502
You ain't gonna hurt her,
are ya?

51:12.803 --> 51:14.071
No.

51:15.106 --> 51:16.841
Why can't you call?

51:16.907 --> 51:18.576
It'll come better from you.

51:20.411 --> 51:23.548
Tell her Lula said I needed
to speak to Little Rock.

51:24.682 --> 51:26.151
'Little Rock.'

51:39.730 --> 51:43.301
- You ain't no friend of Lula.

51:43.368 --> 51:44.635
- Sit down.

51:44.702 --> 51:46.804
Just wanna ask you
a few questions.

51:46.871 --> 51:48.739
I'm not police, okay?

51:48.806 --> 51:50.241
Really not police.

52:04.822 --> 52:06.557
You want something to eat?

52:08.793 --> 52:11.262
Yeah, get me
a burger and chips.

52:14.865 --> 52:16.334
Burger and chips.

52:51.101 --> 52:53.304
Bastard, bastard leg.

52:55.440 --> 52:58.075
'I don't know.
He said he was a mate.'

52:58.142 --> 53:02.112
Yeah, well, Lula never had
any mates who looked like him

53:02.179 --> 53:04.782
so I bounced.

53:04.849 --> 53:06.317
Of course not!

53:07.685 --> 53:09.887
'But you need
to sort me out again.'

53:12.022 --> 53:13.324
Rochelle.

53:14.659 --> 53:15.860
Leave me alone!

53:17.528 --> 53:19.364
- This guy's bothering me.

53:19.430 --> 53:21.065
- Please!
- 'Hey, leave her alone!'

53:23.000 --> 53:24.302
Yeah.

53:24.369 --> 53:25.703
'Get out of here.'

53:33.644 --> 53:37.715
- Uh...badly.

53:42.287 --> 53:44.589
How do you feel
about identity theft?

54:01.939 --> 54:04.041
'Yeah, it's Rochelle Onifade.'

54:04.108 --> 54:05.543
I lost my appointment card.

54:07.177 --> 54:09.547
It is, it's, uh

54:09.614 --> 54:13.751
13th of November, 1994.

54:13.818 --> 54:15.920
Do you wanna know the time
as well?

54:15.986 --> 54:17.988
Uh, what address
you got for me there?

54:19.924 --> 54:22.827
'Cause I've been movin' about
a bit since I last saw ya.

54:22.893 --> 54:27.031
Yeah. Just tell me what address
you got for me there.

54:29.934 --> 54:31.336
Thank you.

54:36.541 --> 54:40.511
- Not bad. I'll head down there.

54:40.578 --> 54:42.847
Oh, can you, uh,
fill in my time sheet

54:42.913 --> 54:44.582
in case I'm not here
when you get back?

54:44.649 --> 54:47.385
- I'll do it tomorrow.
- Today is my last day.

54:48.619 --> 54:49.620
Oh.

54:57.595 --> 54:59.764
Good luck with the job-hunting.

54:59.830 --> 55:00.898
Thanks.

55:01.999 --> 55:03.701
Uh, I..

55:03.768 --> 55:06.637
I could...come back next week

55:06.704 --> 55:08.773
and we could cut the agency out.

55:10.808 --> 55:13.043
- Yeah.
- If..

55:13.110 --> 55:14.512
That could work.

55:21.218 --> 55:22.420
Great.

56:04.562 --> 56:06.497
The lift is broken again.

57:12.497 --> 57:13.998
Rochelle?

57:16.867 --> 57:17.935
Rochelle!

57:38.255 --> 57:39.657
Rochelle?

57:51.536 --> 57:53.270
Ah!

58:08.519 --> 58:09.987
Come on, Rochelle.

58:11.388 --> 58:12.857
Come on, Rochelle.

58:14.559 --> 58:15.793
'Rochelle!'

58:46.691 --> 58:48.125
You got a cause of death yet?

58:48.192 --> 58:49.927
A drug dealer maybe
on a rented number.

58:49.994 --> 58:52.129
Listen, I'm quite busy
with real cases, so..

58:54.364 --> 58:56.300
You have no idea.

58:56.366 --> 58:57.568
About what?

58:57.635 --> 59:00.104
She was frightened of him.

59:00.905 --> 59:02.707
Who?

59:04.408 --> 59:07.544
Get the fuck away from me!
He's harassin' me!

59:07.612 --> 59:09.680
- Some fashion designer.

59:09.747 --> 59:12.449
- 'They call him Guy Some.'
- Guy Some.

59:12.516 --> 59:13.784
Lights!

59:16.320 --> 59:18.589
- I'm Ciara.
- I know.

59:19.790 --> 59:21.859
I won't be around
early afternoon, anyway.

59:21.926 --> 59:24.795
- Job interview.
