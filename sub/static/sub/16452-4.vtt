00:49.600 --> 00:51.100

I'M GONNA CHAT THESE PEOPLE UP.

01:04.000 --> 01:04.700
THANK YOU.

01:06.600 --> 01:07.600
HEY, FOLKS...

LOOK, I'M GONNA ASK FOR
SOME PATIENCE HERE, ALL RIGHT?

01:10.400 --> 01:12.400
WE'LL HAVE PEOPLE COME OUT
AND SPEAK TO YOU.

01:23.800 --> 01:26.700
HER NAME IS RUBY WILLIAMS.
SHE'S 8 YEARS OLD.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.800
HER TEACHER SAID SHE WENT HOME
FOR LUNCH AROUND NOON.

01:28.900 --> 01:30.700
WHEN SHE DIDN'T SHOW UP,
HER MOM CALLED THE SCHOOL,

01:30.800 --> 01:31.800
CALLED ALL OF RUBY'S FRIENDS.

01:31.900 --> 01:35.000
NOBODY HAD SEEN HER,
SO AT 12:29, SHE CALLED 911.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.300
THAT WAS NEARLY 90 MINUTES AGO.

01:37.900 --> 01:39.400
RESPONDING OFFICERS CHECKED THE HOUSE,

01:39.500 --> 01:41.200
STARTED RETRACING
RUBY'S ROUTE FROM SCHOOL.

01:41.300 --> 01:44.400
NO SIGN OF HER.AT 1:00,
THEY CALLED FOR ADDITIONAL UNITS.

01:44.600 --> 01:46.200
HAVE WE STARTED A GRID SEARCH
OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD?

01:46.300 --> 01:48.400
YES, MA'AM -- STOPPING EVERY CAR,
KNOCKING ON EVERY DOOR.

01:48.500 --> 01:50.300
WE GOT UNIFORMS AND DETECTIVE
THAT HAVE ROLLED OUT

01:50.400 --> 01:52.900
FROM HOLLYWOOD, WILSHIRE,
AND NORTHEAST DIVISION TO LEND A HAND,

01:53.000 --> 01:54.300
AND THE FBI IS HERE, TOO.

01:54.400 --> 01:55.400
AFTERNOON.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.100
ALL THESE DIFFERENT DIVISIONS,

01:58.200 --> 01:59.800
THERE'S NO TIME
FOR A TURF WAR, SERGEANT.

01:59.900 --> 02:01.800
EVERYBODY KNOWS --
A CHILD GOES MISSING,

02:01.900 --> 02:03.600
PRIORITY HOMICIDE RUNS THE SHOW.

02:03.700 --> 02:05.100
ALL RIGHT,THEN.THANK YOU.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.200
GENTLEMEN.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.000
ALL RIGHT,
IT'S JUST AFTER 2:00 P.M.,

02:15.100 --> 02:18.000
WHICH MEANS THAT RUBY WILLIAMS
HAS BEEN MISSING FOR TWO HOURS.

02:18.100 --> 02:20.300
WE'LL START WITH THE FAMILY,
AND WE'LL WORK OUR WAY OUT.

02:20.400 --> 02:23.200
THE FBI's HERE TO GIVE US
WHATEVER SUPPORT WE NEED.

02:23.300 --> 02:26.600
WE'VE GOT GUYS FROM THE BEHAVIORAL UNIT
WORKING UP PROFILES ON POSSIBLE SUSPECTS.

02:26.700 --> 02:28.300
LOOK,IF RUBY <i>WAS</i>  SNATCHED,

02:28.400 --> 02:30.300
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES
SHE'S STILL ALIVE COME SUNDOWN?

02:30.400 --> 02:33.200
WE COULD GET A CALL ANY MINUTE SAYING
SOMEONE FOUND THIS LITTLE GIRL

02:33.300 --> 02:35.800
WITH A FRIEND PLAYING HOOKY
OR JUST PLAIN LOST.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.300
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES DO WE USE THE WORD
"HOMICIDE" IN FRONT OF THIS FAMILY.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.400
OKAY?
LET'S JUST KEEP OUR HEADS.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.000
DO THE WILLIAMSES HAVE A COMPUTER?

02:48.100 --> 02:49.400
DID WE GET PERMISSION TO TAKE IT?

02:49.500 --> 02:52.500
I DID A BACKGROUND CHECK
ON MOM, DAD, UNCLES --

02:52.600 --> 02:54.000
NO CRIMINAL RECORD.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.500
THAT'S RUBY'S OLDER BROTHER,CARLTON.

02:56.600 --> 02:59.300
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
WALK HER HOME, BUT HE FORGOT.

02:59.400 --> 03:00.600
SAYS HE WAS PLAYING VIDEO GAMES.

03:00.700 --> 03:02.700
WE MAY BE TALKING TO HIM AGAIN LATER.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.100
THANK YOU.

03:08.600 --> 03:11.400
MR. AND MRS. WILLIAMS,
I'M DEPUTY CHIEF JOHNSON.

03:11.500 --> 03:14.100
I THINK YOU'VE ALREADY MET
SERGEANT GABRIEL.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.600
WE NEED TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT RUBY.

03:16.700 --> 03:18.700
WE'VE ALREADY TALKED
TO FOUR DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

03:18.800 --> 03:21.500
AND I HOPE WE'RE THE LAST.
I REALLY DO.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.200
MRS. WILLIAMS, I KNOW
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH AN ORDEAL,

03:25.300 --> 03:28.000
BUT I NEED YOU TO HELP ME.

03:29.300 --> 03:31.200
WILL YOU PLEASE HELP ME?

03:36.400 --> 03:40.100
MR. WILLIAMS,IS RUBY 
ALLOWED ON THE INTERNET?

03:40.800 --> 03:42.300
I DON'T LET EITHER OF MY KIDS
GO ONLINE

03:42.400 --> 03:45.300
UNLESS THERE'S A SCHOOL PROJECT,
AND THEN I SUPERVISE.

03:46.300 --> 03:49.600
HER TEACHERS LOVE HER.
SHE MAKES A's AND B's.

03:50.100 --> 03:53.400
ONLY REASON SHE'S DOING SUMMER SCHOOL
IS SO THAT SHE CAN PLAY THE VIOLIN.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.800
SHE'S GOT A SOLO IN THE FALL CONCERT.

03:57.700 --> 04:01.100
THERE SHE IS, IN THE BACKYARD,
GETTING READY FOR THE EASTER PAGEANT.

04:02.800 --> 04:04.400
<i>THANK YOU, GRANDMA.</i>
 <i>WE LOVE THE DRESS.</i>

04:04.500 --> 04:05.500
LOOK AT HER.

04:08.100 --> 04:11.900
SHE'S A, UM...
SHE'S A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE GIRL.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.100
 <i>"ODE TO JOY."</i>

04:13.400 --> 04:15.600
HAS SHE HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE 

04:15.700 --> 04:17.500
OTHER CHILDREN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD?

04:19.700 --> 04:23.600
DOES SHE HAVE A RELATIONSHIP
WITH ANY OF HER GRANDPARENTS?

04:23.900 --> 04:24.600
<i>WATCH. YOU READY?</i>

04:24.700 --> 04:27.700
MY PARENTS PASSED AWAY
BEFORE RUBY WAS BORN.

04:27.900 --> 04:30.400
- RANDALL'S MOTHER LIVES IN TEXAS...
- WITH MY SISTER.

04:30.500 --> 04:33.100
RUBY SEES HER AT CHRISTMASTIME.

04:33.900 --> 04:36.900
HAS RUBY BEEN HAVING ANY TROUBLE
WITH HER OLDER BROTHER?

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
NO.

04:38.400 --> 04:40.000
HOW ABOUT YOU AND YOUR WIFE?

04:40.500 --> 04:41.600
YOU TWO GETTING ON?

04:41.800 --> 04:44.900
RUBY'S GOT A GOOD HOME HERE.
SHE'S A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
AND WE ALWAYS TELL HER,

04:47.300 --> 04:50.200
"IF A STRANGER TALKS TO YOU FUNNY...

04:51.300 --> 04:52.800
YOU RUN."

04:52.900 --> 04:55.600
"RUN, RUN, RUN!"

04:55.700 --> 04:58.100
"RUN, RUN, RUN."

05:04.900 --> 05:06.800
WE'RE GONNA BRING
YOUR LITTLE GIRL HOME.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.000
I PROMISE YOU THAT.

05:21.500 --> 05:22.800
DOES IT LOOK LIKE A FAMILY THING?

05:22.900 --> 05:24.300
MY GUT TELLS ME NO.

05:24.500 --> 05:26.500
WHATEVER RESOURCES YOU NEED,
YOU GOT IT.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.800
LOOK, WILL, I JUST DON'T THINK
THE MOTHER'S IN ANY SHAPE

05:28.900 --> 05:30.000
TO GO IN FRONT OF THE CAMERAS
RIGHT NOW.

05:30.100 --> 05:34.000
LISTEN, BRENDA, ASSUMING THE WORST,
THIS CAN ONLY HELP.

05:34.300 --> 05:37.100
YOU KNOW MOST CHILD ABDUCTORS DON'T
SEE THEIR VICTIMS AS REAL PEOPLE.

05:37.200 --> 05:40.000
LET'S LET THIS GUY SEE
WHAT KIND OF PAIN HE'S CAUSING.

05:41.100 --> 05:42.200
ALL RIGHT.

05:47.900 --> 05:50.200
THIS IS MY BABY GIRL.

05:50.800 --> 05:54.200
HER NAME IS RUBY WILLIAMS.

05:55.100 --> 05:58.200
IF ANYONE OUT THERE KNOWS ANYTHING,

05:58.600 --> 06:01.000
IF ANYONE SAW HER...

06:02.700 --> 06:05.700
MY BABY!
OH, MY --

06:05.800 --> 06:09.000
I WANT MY BABY.PLEASE.

06:09.100 --> 06:11.700
I WANT MY BABY GIRL.

06:11.900 --> 06:13.700
FIND MY RUBY.

06:14.600 --> 06:17.300
OH, MY LORD,
WHERE'S MY BABY?

06:17.400 --> 06:21.200
UH, THE, UH, LAPD
IS SEEKING INFORMATION

06:21.300 --> 06:24.700
REGARDING THE DISAPPEARANCE
OF 8-YEAR-OLD RUBY WILLIAMS.

06:24.800 --> 06:28.100
SHE WAS LAST SEEN WALKING HOME
FROM SCHOOL NEARLY THREE HOURS AGO.

06:29.800 --> 06:32.400
HAVE WE GOTTEN ANYTHING USEFUL
FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD CANVASS?

06:32.500 --> 06:34.600
I'M ENTERING DATA
FROM EVERY FIELD INTERVIEW

06:34.700 --> 06:37.100
INTO THE SYSTEM
AS FAST AS I CAN GET IT.

06:37.200 --> 06:38.800
LET'S SEE --
WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT PEOPLE

06:38.900 --> 06:40.900
SAW A GREEN TRUCK
BY THE SCHOOL AROUND NOON.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.400
I ALSO HAVE A BLUE VAN,

06:42.500 --> 06:44.300
A SUSPICIOUS BROWN DELIVERY VEHICLE,

06:44.400 --> 06:45.300
AND AN ICE-CREAM TRUCK.

06:45.400 --> 06:47.200
GREEN TRUCK.
I'VE GOT ONE OF THOSE.

06:47.300 --> 06:48.600
YEAH, WE FOUND THE GREEN TRUCK

06:48.700 --> 06:50.700
AND THE MEXICAN GARDENERS
THAT WENT WITH IT,

06:50.800 --> 06:52.100
AND THEY DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

06:52.200 --> 06:55.200
WE INTERVIEWED THE ICE-CREAM MAN,
AND HE WAS GONE BY 11:00.

06:55.300 --> 06:58.200
HEY, MIKE, YOU CAN CROSS OFF
THE BROWN DELIVERY TRUCK, TOO.

06:58.300 --> 07:02.300
DRIVER WAS UPLOADING DOWNTOWN
BETWEEN 12:00 AND 1:30.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.000
SUPERVISOR BACKS HIM UP.

07:04.100 --> 07:05.900
- WHAT ABOUT THE BLUE VAN?
- ??

07:06.000 --> 07:07.900
NEIGHBOR SAW IT PARKED
ON THE STREET THREE DAYS AGO.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.600
WHEN SHE TRIED TO GET A BETTER LOOK,
THE DRIVER TOOK OFF.

07:10.700 --> 07:12.200
SHE SEE HIS FACE?

07:12.600 --> 07:15.100
WHITE GUY,
KIND OF AVERAGE-LOOKING.

07:15.900 --> 07:18.700
OKAY, SO, WHITE GUY, KIND OF
AVERAGE-LOOKING, BLUE VAN.

07:18.800 --> 07:19.900
THAT DOESN'T GIVE US
MUCH TO GO ON.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
??HANG ON, CHIEF.
I HAVE A BLUE VAN.

07:23.300 --> 07:27.000
GUY HERE SAW IT TWICE
THIS MORNING ON <i>THIS</i>  STREET.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.600
HEY, CHIEF --
DOES SILVER COUNT?

07:29.700 --> 07:31.700
I GOT A WHITE MALE IN A SILVER/BLUE VAN

07:31.800 --> 07:33.700
AROUND 11:30 THIS MORNING.

07:35.700 --> 07:37.700
WHAT'S THE FASTEST WAY
OUT OF THIS NEIGHBORHOOD?

07:38.800 --> 07:41.300
THIS IS THE ROUTE
FROM RUBY'S SCHOOL TO HER HOUSE.

07:41.400 --> 07:42.800
THEN I GOT TWO EXITS.

07:42.900 --> 07:45.800
I CAN EITHER GO THIS WAY --
I'M ON THE 101 IN 10 MINUTES --

07:45.900 --> 07:46.600
OR...

07:46.700 --> 07:48.600
HE HEADS NORTH
RIGHT INTO GRIFFITH PARK.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.700
THEN I CAN BE AT THE 134
OR 5 FREEWAYS IN 10 MINUTES.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.100
OKAY, THESE STREETS ARE BUSINESSES.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.900
MAYBE SOME OF THEM HAVE SECURITY CAMERAS.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.200
I CAN HAVE MY GUYS PULL THE FOOTAGE.

07:59.300 --> 08:02.000
LOOK AT EVERY VEHICLE ENTERING
AND EXITING THE NEIGHBORHOOD

08:02.100 --> 08:03.600
FROM 9:00 A.M. TO 2:00 P.M. TODAY.

08:03.700 --> 08:06.900
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA,PLEASE CONTACT THE CITY
ABOUT WHOEVER RUNS THE TRAFFIC CAMERAS.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.800
MAYBE OUR BLUE VAN RAN A RED LIGHT.

08:08.900 --> 08:10.000
- LIEUTENANT FLYNN --
- CHIEF!

08:10.100 --> 08:12.300
DETECTIVE SANCHEZ IS WITH THE K-9 UNIT.

08:12.400 --> 08:13.900
DOGS FOUND SOMETHING.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.400
BUZZ, WOULD YOU DOCUMENT THIS, PLEASE?

08:25.900 --> 08:29.300
OHH. THIS IS BAD.
THIS IS VERY BAD.

08:29.400 --> 08:30.400
HANG ON, HANG ON.

08:30.500 --> 08:33.100
DETECTIVE, DIDN'T THE SEARCH
TEAM COVER THIS AREA ALREADY?

08:33.200 --> 08:34.000
NO, MA'AM.

08:34.100 --> 08:35.600
THEY CHECKED THE ROAD
FROM THE GIRL'S SCHOOL,

08:35.700 --> 08:37.200
BUT THIS ALLEY'S A DEAD END.

08:37.299 --> 08:38.700
THE DOGS LED US HERE.

08:40.700 --> 08:41.600
OKAY.

08:41.700 --> 08:43.299
RUN, RUN, RUN.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.600
RUBY WAS DOING EXACTLY
WHAT HER PARENTS TOLD HER TO DO.

08:45.700 --> 08:46.800
THE DRIVER
MUST HAVE COME UP ON HER

08:46.900 --> 08:48.200
AS SHE WAS WALKING HOME FROM SCHOOL.

08:48.300 --> 08:50.700
MAYBE TRIED TO TALK HER IN THE CAR,
MAYBE A BLITZ ATTACK.

08:50.800 --> 08:54.200
EITHER WAY, SHE RAN,
AND THIS IS WHERE SHE WAS GRABBED.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.900
SEE HOW HER SLEEVES ARE INSIDE OUT?

09:02.000 --> 09:03.800
SHE WAS PULLED
RIGHT OUT OF HER JACKET.

09:04.100 --> 09:05.500
I GOT YOUR BLUE VAN.

09:06.400 --> 09:08.800
AT 10:32 A.M.,

09:08.900 --> 09:11.000
THE VAN HEADS NORTH ON HILLHURST,

09:11.100 --> 09:13.300
PASSING THIS LIQUOR STORE.

09:13.600 --> 09:15.300
NOW, THIS FILM IS FROM THE SAME CAMERA,

09:15.400 --> 09:19.400
BUT 32 MINUTES LATER,
HE'S GOING THE OTHER WAY.

09:19.600 --> 09:23.600
HERE HE COMES AGAIN AT 11:39,
GOING BACK THE <i>OTHER</i>  WAY.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.500
- HE WAS TROLLING.
- RIGHT.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.400
NOW, WE DON'T PICK HIM UP
ON THIS CAMERA AGAIN.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.900
INSTEAD, HE SHOWS UP ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD, HERE,

09:31.000 --> 09:33.700
SIX BLOCKS FROM WHERE
YOU GUYS FOUND THE JACKET.

09:33.800 --> 09:39.000
THIS MINI-MALL CAMERA
PICKS HIM UP AT 12:21:23 --

09:39.100 --> 09:41.600
21 MINUTES AFTER RUBY LEFT SCHOOL.

09:41.700 --> 09:44.900
NEXT CLEAN SHOT WE GET OF HIM IS HERE --

09:45.200 --> 09:47.100
12:21:46.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.400
HE IS LEAVING THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

09:48.500 --> 09:49.300
CAN'T SEE THE DRIVER.

09:49.400 --> 09:53.300
AND HERE HE IS APPROACHING
THIS INTERSECTION AT 12:22:02.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.700
CHIEF,THINK I GOT A PLATE NUMBER.

09:56.900 --> 09:59.000
12:22:08,

09:59.100 --> 10:01.900
OUR BLUE VAN CUTS THROUGH THE GAS STATION
AT THE RED LIGHT.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.100
- OH, HE WAS IN A HURRY.
- MAKE THIS BIGGER.

10:04.200 --> 10:08.200
OKAY -- 4DLX401.

10:08.500 --> 10:10.700
GIVE ME THREE SECONDS.
LET ME PRINT IT OUT.

I GOT A VIN NUMBER AND A NAME.

AT HIS ADDRESS.

10:28.600 --> 10:29.400
GOT ONE ON SPEED DIAL.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.300

11:04.800 --> 11:06.500
DETECTIVE SANCHEZ,

11:06.600 --> 11:08.100
WOULD YOU MIND GIVING IT A TRY?

GET OUT!

11:15.300 --> 11:17.100

YOU SIGNED A CONSENT FORM ALLOWING
SEARCHES OF YOUR PERSON,PROPERTY,

11:26.900 --> 11:28.600
AND RESIDENCE WITHOUT A WARRANT.

11:29.800 --> 11:30.600
GO ON.

11:31.200 --> 11:32.500
KITCHEN'S CLEAR!

11:32.900 --> 11:33.800
FIND IT.

11:34.100 --> 11:35.700
IS THAT YOUR BLUE VAN OVER THERE?

11:35.800 --> 11:36.500
YEAH.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.300
LIEUTENANT.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.200
WHY CAN'T YOU LEAVE ME ALONE?

11:49.700 --> 11:50.400
OKAY.

11:50.500 --> 11:52.400
- HAVE YOU BEEN HOME ALL DAY?
- I WAS TAKING A NAP.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.000
- CAN ANYONE VERIFY THAT?
- NO.

11:54.100 --> 11:56.600
DID ANYONE BORROW YOUR VAN
WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING?

11:56.700 --> 11:58.000
- THIS AIN'T FAIR.
- ANSWER THE QUESTION!

11:58.100 --> 11:59.500
NO! YOU GUYS KEEP PICKING ON ME!

11:59.600 --> 12:00.800
MR. STIMPLE...

12:01.300 --> 12:02.600
WHY CAN'T YOU LEAVE ME ALONE?

12:02.700 --> 12:04.500
I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS.

12:04.800 --> 12:06.300
- FIND IT.
- YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT!

12:06.400 --> 12:07.000
FIND IT.

12:26.800 --> 12:28.100
WE GET ANYTHING
FROM THE SUSPECT'S VAN?

12:28.200 --> 12:29.100
NOTHING YET.

12:29.200 --> 12:30.800
<i>MR. STIMPLE,</i>

12:30.900 --> 12:32.000
<i>YOUR RIGHTS WERE READ TO YOU IN THE CAR.</i>

12:32.100 --> 12:34.200
WHAT ABOUT THE CAR
UNDER THE TARP? IS THAT HIS, TOO?

12:34.300 --> 12:38.200
1977 MERCURY COUGAR.
IN LESS THAN MINT CONDITION.

12:39.200 --> 12:42.100
THERE'S NO WAY HE'S KEEPING
A CLUNKER LIKE THAT UNDER CANVAS

12:42.200 --> 12:43.400
UNLESS HE'S HIDING SOMETHING.

12:43.500 --> 12:46.200
CHIEF JOHNSON IS HAVING THEM
TEAR IT APART RIGHT NOW.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.600
THIS IS TERRIBLE.

12:49.700 --> 12:52.800
I'M GONNA DO MY BEST TO GET YOU
THROUGH THIS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

12:53.100 --> 12:55.400
BUT FIRST, IS THERE ANYONE
YOU'D LIKE US TO CALL?

12:55.900 --> 12:58.400
YOUR WIFE OR YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

12:59.200 --> 13:01.000
I DON'T HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.100
WHAT ABOUT YOUR BOSS?

13:04.200 --> 13:06.400
I WAS LAID OFF THREE WEEKS AGO.

13:06.600 --> 13:08.400
OH.THAT'S TOO BAD.

13:09.100 --> 13:10.200
WHAT WERE YOU DOING?

13:10.700 --> 13:12.200
I WAS LANDSCAPING.

13:13.600 --> 13:14.900
MOSTLY MOW AND BLOW.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.400
WHAT DO YOU DO NOW?
FOR WORK, I MEAN.

13:17.500 --> 13:18.700
IT'S NOT THAT EASY TO GET A JOB

13:18.800 --> 13:22.300
AS A REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER...IS IT?

13:23.400 --> 13:26.500
YOU'RE REFERRING TO YOUR
CONVICTION FOR SEXUAL BATTERY.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.500
SOME GIRL SAYS I GROPED HER...

13:29.400 --> 13:31.500
AND I GET 2 1/2 YEARS.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.300
NOW I GOT TO MOVE AGAIN --

13:34.400 --> 13:37.100
AFTER YOU GUYS DRAGGED ME
OUT OF MY HOUSE IN HANDCUFFS.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.800
ALL BECAUSE A DOG BARKED AT MY VAN.

13:39.900 --> 13:42.000
THAT MUST BE VERY FRUSTRATING.

13:42.800 --> 13:44.700
ESPECIALLY AFTER YOU'VE ALREADY
SERVED YOUR TIME IN PRISON.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.600
NO MATTER WHAT I DO...

13:47.400 --> 13:49.200
NOBODY TRUSTS ME.

13:50.300 --> 13:53.100
OH, MY MOTHER'S GONNA THINK
THIS IS MY FAULT.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.200
WHY IS THAT?

13:55.700 --> 13:58.100
WHEN I GOT FIRED, SHE SAID
SHE DIDN'T WANT ME TO COME HOME

13:59.400 --> 14:01.300
AND NOT TO BOTHER HER ANYMORE.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.800
SHE DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO HEAR
MY SIDE OF THE STORY.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.900
"BLAME ROGER FIRST."

14:07.100 --> 14:08.800
THAT'S HER MANTRO.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.300
OR MOTTO OR WHATEVER.

14:10.400 --> 14:11.800
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

14:12.800 --> 14:14.500
THAT IS SO UNFAIR.

14:15.100 --> 14:16.600
WHEN THE REST OF THE WORLD
LETS YOU DOWN,

14:16.700 --> 14:19.200
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE ABLE
TO COUNT ON YOUR MOTHER.

14:20.300 --> 14:22.900
SHE'S SUPPOSED TO LOVE YOU
NO MATTER WHAT.

14:25.800 --> 14:29.100
AND RIGHT NOW,
THERE'S ANOTHER LITTLE GIRL...

14:30.300 --> 14:33.300
THAT I'M SURE WOULD LIKE
TO TALK TO HER MOTHER AND CAN'T.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.900
MIGHT HAVE HEARD ABOUT HER
ON THE NEWS.

14:36.300 --> 14:38.000
LITTLE GIRL WENT MISSING TODAY.

14:38.600 --> 14:41.700
I'M SURE HER MOTHER IS JUST
DESPERATE TO HEAR HER VOICE.

14:42.400 --> 14:45.800
AND I-I FEEL STRONGLY THAT
YOU CAN HELP US WITH THIS,

14:45.900 --> 14:47.600
BECAUSE YOU WERE DRIVING AROUND

14:47.700 --> 14:50.600
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
WHERE SHE WENT MISSING.

14:50.700 --> 14:53.300
<i>SO IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING</i>
<i>OR YOU SAW ANYTHING,</i>

14:53.800 --> 14:55.500
I'D REALLY LIKE TO KNOW.

14:57.700 --> 14:58.700
ROGER.

15:03.100 --> 15:05.500
YOU KNOW WHERE I MIGHT FIND
THIS LITTLE GIRL?

15:25.700 --> 15:27.200
WHAT LITTLE GIRL?

15:33.700 --> 15:35.600
HER NAME IS RUBY WILLIAMS.

15:37.300 --> 15:38.800
SHE'S 8 YEARS OLD.

15:40.500 --> 15:42.400
SHE LIKES TO PLAY THE VIOLIN.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.700
AND THIS AFTERNOON,
ON HER WAY HOME FROM SCHOOL,

15:50.800 --> 15:52.300
SHE WAS ABDUCTED.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.900
SHE WAS IN YOUR VAN!

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
IF SOMETHING HAPPENED,
I WANT TO HELP YOU FIGURE THIS OUT.

16:01.600 --> 16:04.200
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
TO EXPLAIN YOURSELF.

16:12.200 --> 16:13.700
I WANT A LAWYER.

16:17.900 --> 16:19.100
INTERVIEW OVER.

16:22.700 --> 16:24.100
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

16:37.800 --> 16:39.800
FRITZ, ARE WE ANY CLOSER
TO FINDING THE GIRL?

16:39.900 --> 16:41.200
HANG ON, WILL.

16:42.100 --> 16:44.200
DIDN'T GET ANYTHING FROM THE VAN
OR THE APARTMENT?

16:44.600 --> 16:46.800
NO. NO.
HE'S LAWYERED UP.

16:46.900 --> 16:48.700
AND I NEED SOMETHING
THAT TIES HIM TO RUBY WILLIAMS,

16:48.800 --> 16:51.200
OTHER THAN THE TESTIMONY
OF A GERMAN SHEPHERD.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.700
DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.700
AND HOW WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO LOOK AT YOU?

16:59.800 --> 17:01.400
DON'T JUDGE ME.

17:02.900 --> 17:04.700
I KNOW THAT LOOK.

17:05.500 --> 17:09.000
<i>WELL, YOU KNOW, I KNOW A LITTLE</i>
<i>SOMETHING ABOUT LOOKS, TOO.</i>

17:09.599 --> 17:10.700
LOOKING AT YOU...

17:11.200 --> 17:13.200
YOU KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS LITTLE GIRL.

17:22.599 --> 17:24.200
SHE'S NOT <i>THAT</i>  LITTLE.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.300
OH, REALLY?

17:31.400 --> 17:33.200
YOU SEE, EVERYONE...

17:33.700 --> 17:35.400
PRETENDS KIDS...

17:36.400 --> 17:38.400
DON'T WANT SEX.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.800
BUT THEY DO.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.600
YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE A KID?

17:47.500 --> 17:49.100
THAT'S ALL YOU THOUGHT ABOUT.

17:49.900 --> 17:51.500
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH IT.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.600
IT'S BIOLOGY.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.200
AND BESIDES...

18:00.500 --> 18:02.300
BLACK GIRLS ARE DIFFERENT.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.300
IS THAT RIGHT?

18:10.000 --> 18:11.300
I MEAN, LOOK AT HER.

18:14.100 --> 18:17.300
BLACK GIRLS ARE WAY MORE
SEXUALLY MATURE THAN WHITE GIRLS.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE KIDS SO YOUNG.

18:25.600 --> 18:28.400
YOU PROBABLY GREW UP
SWIMMING IN BLACK ASS.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.100
IT'S THE WAY THEY WALK.

18:36.400 --> 18:38.700
SHAKE...SHAKE...

18:39.000 --> 18:40.800
SHAKIN' THEIR THING.

18:47.800 --> 18:48.800
KILL THE FEED, BUZZ.

18:48.900 --> 18:50.800
- BUT THE CHIEF SAID NO.
- I SAID KILL IT!

18:58.900 --> 19:01.700
DO <i>NOT</i>  LEAVE THIS ROOM!

19:04.200 --> 19:05.600
WHY NOT?

19:06.700 --> 19:08.700
BECAUSE SERGEANT GABRIEL...

19:09.900 --> 19:12.300
IS ABOUT TO MAKE A BREAK IN THE CASE.

19:16.500 --> 19:19.200
NO, DETECTIVE DANIS, DON'T SAY
ANYTHING TO THE FAMILY YET.

19:19.300 --> 19:20.600
COULD BE A HOAX.

19:21.600 --> 19:24.700
NO, NO. HE WOULDN'T TELL ME.
HE TOLD SERGEANT GABRIEL.

19:25.500 --> 19:27.600
YES, IT <i>IS</i>  AMAZING.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.200
UH, IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHO HE TOLD -- WE KNOW.

19:30.300 --> 19:33.200
SEND FOUR BLACK-AND-WHITES
TO THE VERMONT CANYON ENTRANCE

19:33.300 --> 19:35.200
BY THE PAY PHONES
AT THE REST AREA.

19:36.200 --> 19:38.100
AND, UH, SEND THE K-9s.

19:38.300 --> 19:39.200
THANK YOU.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.900
SERGEANT GABRIEL,
JUST TO BE CLEAR --

19:42.000 --> 19:44.300
ROGER SAID??
THAT HE LEFT RUBY AT THE PARK.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.900
HE DIDN'T SAY THAT SHE WAS DEAD.
IS THAT RIGHT?

19:58.700 --> 20:00.500
WHERE ARE THE PHONES?
WHERE ARE THE PHONES?!

20:15.700 --> 20:16.600
RUBY!

20:18.700 --> 20:19.500
RUBY!

20:21.900 --> 20:22.500
DAMN IT!

20:57.900 --> 20:59.400
???

22:13.300 --> 22:14.200
IN MY OFFICE.

22:21.100 --> 22:22.000
WHAT DID YOU DO?

22:22.800 --> 22:24.800
WE FOUND HER, DIDN'T WE?
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I DID.

22:26.200 --> 22:27.300
NOTHING MATTERS MORE.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.400
ROGER STIMPLE
DIDN'T LOOK LIKE THAT

22:31.800 --> 22:33.100
WHEN I LEFT
THE INTERVIEW ROOM.

22:34.100 --> 22:35.700
SO, I NEED TO KNOW,
SERGEANT --

22:37.100 --> 22:38.400
DID YOU BEAT
THE SUSPECT?

22:38.400 --> 22:39.300
HE DESERVED IT.

22:40.700 --> 22:42.800
THAT IS NOT SOMETHING
THAT YOU GET TO DECIDE

22:43.300 --> 22:45.700
ON YOUR OWN
IN AN INTERVIEW ROOM

22:46.100 --> 22:47.000
WITH YOUR FISTS.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.700
ARE YOU SERIOUSLY
TAKING HIS SIDE?

22:50.400 --> 22:52.800
HE KILLED HER.
I GOT A CONFESSION.

22:52.800 --> 22:54.100
<i>YOU GOT AN ADMISSION.</i>

22:55.300 --> 22:57.200
ROGER TOLD YOU
WHERE TO FIND HER.

22:58.800 --> 23:01.100
NOT THAT HE TOOK HER,
NOT THAT HE KILLED HER.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.700
AND SINCE YOU BEAT
THAT ADMISSION OUT OF HIM,

23:03.700 --> 23:05.100
A JURY WON'T BE ABLE
TO HEAR IT ANYWAY.

23:09.700 --> 23:14.000
I PROMISED THAT MOTHER I WAS
GONNA BRING HER DAUGHTER HOME.

23:14.300 --> 23:16.200
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO.

23:16.200 --> 23:18.200
YOU COMMITTED
A CRIMINAL ACT.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.600
WHEN ROGER GETS A LAWYER
AND TELLS HIM WHAT YOU DID

23:25.800 --> 23:27.400
AND I.A.
HEARS HIS COMPLAINT...

23:30.600 --> 23:31.600
WHAT ABOUT YOUR FUTURE?

23:41.300 --> 23:43.200
WELL, WHAT DO YOU --
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO NOW?

23:48.400 --> 23:49.100
JUST GO HOME.

23:51.100 --> 23:52.300
????

24:12.500 --> 24:14.400
<i>YOU PROBABLY GREW UP
SWIMMING IN BLACK ASS.</i>

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
<i>IT'S THE WAY THEY WALK.</i>

24:19.300 --> 24:21.500
<i>SHAKE...SHAKE...</i>

24:22.100 --> 24:23.400
<i>SHAKIN' THEIR THING.</i>

24:35.500 --> 24:37.000
BUZZ, WHY DID YOU STOP
THE TAPING?

24:38.000 --> 24:40.200
I THOUGHT
WHEN YOU, UH, LEFT THE ROOM,

24:40.200 --> 24:41.200
THE INTERVIEW WAS OVER.

24:42.300 --> 24:43.800
I HAVE MADE MYSELF
PERFECTLY CLEAR --

24:44.200 --> 24:45.700
UNLESS I STOP THAT TAPE
MYSELF,

24:45.700 --> 24:48.000
IT STAYS ON AS LONG AS
THE SUSPECT IS IN THE ROOM.

24:48.000 --> 24:48.800
CHIEF...

24:51.000 --> 24:51.900
I KILLED THE FEED.

24:52.600 --> 24:53.200
WHY?

24:54.500 --> 24:55.300
BECAUSE...

24:57.000 --> 24:58.400
I THOUGHT
IT WAS A GOOD IDEA.

25:12.900 --> 25:14.900
LIEUTENANT, I WANT YOU
TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE PRISONER.

25:15.200 --> 25:17.900
MAKE SURE HE'S FED.
AND GETS MEDICAL ATTENTION IF HE NEEDS IT.

25:20.500 --> 25:22.200
WE DON'T HAVE TO BOOK HIM
OR LET HIM SEE HIS LAWYER

25:22.200 --> 25:25.000
UNTIL HE'S ARRAIGNED, WHICH
MEANS WE HAVE LESS THAN 43 HOURS

25:25.100 --> 25:27.000
TO TIE HIM TO RUBY'S MURDER
SOME OTHER WAY.

25:28.600 --> 25:31.600
I WANT THE SQUAD WORKING,
BUT NO ONE SEES THIS TAPE

25:32.500 --> 25:34.400
OR KNOWS ABOUT
WHAT SERGEANT GABRIEL HAS DONE.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.400
HAVE I MADE MYSELF
VERY CLEAR?

25:36.500 --> 25:37.200
YES, MA'AM.

25:56.800 --> 25:57.400
THANKS.

25:59.400 --> 26:00.000
HEY.

26:00.200 --> 26:03.900
LISTEN, YOUR INSTINCTS
ABOUT ROGER'S SECOND CAR WERE RIGHT ON.

26:04.600 --> 26:06.600
WE FOUND A REPORT
ON A '77 MERCURY COUGAR

26:06.600 --> 26:09.600
JUST LIKE ROGER'S --
SAME BLUE PAINT ON THE BUMPER --

26:10.000 --> 26:12.800
TIED TO TWO SEPARATE ABDUCTIONS
FIVE YEARS AGO,

26:12.800 --> 26:15.600
BEFORE OUR GUY WENT TO JAIL
ON THAT SEXUAL-BATTERY CHARGE.

26:16.600 --> 26:20.100
TWO GIRLS, AFRICAN-AMERICAN,
AGES 9 AND 11.

26:20.400 --> 26:21.300
THEY WERE NEVER FOUND.

26:22.300 --> 26:24.000
SO RUBY WASN'T
HIS FIRST VICTIM.

26:24.500 --> 26:27.800
WELL,LAST FEW YEARS ON PAROLE
MUST HAVE BEEN A COOLING-OFF PERIOD.

26:27.900 --> 26:30.900
BUT HE JUST LOST HIS JOB, AND
YOU SAID HIS FAMILY CUT HIM OFF?

26:30.900 --> 26:33.800
HE'S GOT SOME KIND
OF A...MOTHER THING.

26:34.400 --> 26:36.700
YEAH, JUST THE KIND OF
STRESSOR EVENTS TO SET HIM OFF.

26:37.300 --> 26:39.600
I SHOULD HAVE NEVER LEFT GABRIEL
ALONE IN THAT ROOM.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.700
I SAW HOW MAD HE WAS.

26:45.700 --> 26:47.000
I KNEW HE WAS UPSET.

26:48.200 --> 26:49.300
YOU TOLD POPE ABOUT IT
YET?

26:49.900 --> 26:50.600
NO.

26:52.400 --> 26:53.800
I'M STILL LOOKING
FOR A WAY OUT.

26:54.300 --> 26:57.900
WELL, YOU TIE ROGER STIMPLE
TO THESE OTHER MISSING GIRLS...

27:04.800 --> 27:06.100
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

27:10.200 --> 27:11.600
DETECTIVE.
YOU'RE WORKING LATE.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.400
UH, YES.

27:13.400 --> 27:15.200
WE FOUND OUT
THAT THE LANDSCAPING FIRM

27:15.200 --> 27:16.800
WHERE ROGER STIMPLE
USED TO WORK

27:17.100 --> 27:19.500
HAD A CONTRACT AT THE PARK
WHERE RUBY WAS FOUND.

27:19.800 --> 27:22.600
<i>COULDN'T YOU HAVE CALLED WITH
THIS INFORMATION, DETECTIVE?</i>

27:23.300 --> 27:24.200
MAY I COME IN?

27:26.200 --> 27:28.200
I'M NOT SURE
WHAT DAVID TOLD YOU.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.600
BUT HE KNOWS
WHAT HE DID WAS WRONG.

27:31.400 --> 27:33.100
WELL, THAT'S A START.

27:33.900 --> 27:36.700
PLEASE DO NOT LET THIS BE THE
LAST THING HE DOES AS A POLICE OFFICER.

27:36.700 --> 27:37.900
THAT MAY NOT BE UP TO ME.

27:38.900 --> 27:41.500
AS SOON AS THE SUSPECT SHOWS UP
IN COURT WITH HIS LAWYER,

27:42.000 --> 27:43.500
DAVID'S ACTIONS
ARE GONNA BE FRONT AND CENTER,

27:43.500 --> 27:45.700
AND THE ONLY WAY OUT OF THIS
IS GONNA BE FOR ME TO LIE.

27:47.600 --> 27:48.700
IS THAT
WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO?

27:53.400 --> 27:54.100
YOU KNOW, I WONDER.

27:57.800 --> 27:59.300
WOULD YOU BE HERE
PLEADING DAVID'S CASE

27:59.300 --> 28:00.300
IF Y'ALL WEREN'T DATING?

28:00.300 --> 28:01.300
<i>BUT WE ARE DATING.</i>

28:01.300 --> 28:04.700
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT.
I DON'T WANT TO DISCUSS IT.

28:14.400 --> 28:15.300
CHIEF...

28:16.100 --> 28:18.100
I KNOW THAT
YOU AND COMMANDER TAYLOR

28:18.600 --> 28:20.400
HAVE A COMPLICATED
RELATIONSHIP.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.000
BUT HE CARES A LOT
ABOUT DAVID,

28:23.900 --> 28:25.400
AND SOMETIMES...

28:26.100 --> 28:28.300
????

28:51.100 --> 28:53.700
CHIEF...WE CHECKED
STIMPLE'S HOME COMPUTER.

28:53.900 --> 28:56.900
NO SIGN OF PORNOGRAPHY --
CHILD OR OTHER.

28:57.400 --> 29:00.400
30-YEAR-OLD SINGLE MAN
LIVES ALONE -- NO PORNOGRAPHY.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.300
<i>NOW, THAT'S SUSPICIOUS.</i>

29:03.200 --> 29:05.700
CHIEF, ONE OF THE KEYS
ON ROGER'S KEY CHAIN

29:05.700 --> 29:07.700
MATCHES THE PADLOCK
ON THE FENCE AT THE PARK.

29:08.100 --> 29:09.300
BOOTS
FROM ROGER'S APARTMENT

29:09.300 --> 29:11.400
MATCH THE PRINTS WE FOUND
IN THE PARK'S BATHROOM.

29:11.400 --> 29:12.800
THAT'S PROBABLY
WHERE HE RAPED HER.

29:13.900 --> 29:16.400
ROGER'S DNA IS ON FILE
FROM PREVIOUS BUSTS.

29:16.400 --> 29:17.900
IT'LL TAKE A FEW DAYS
TO GET A MATCH.

29:18.200 --> 29:20.100
OKAY, WHAT ABOUT
THE TWO OTHER MISSING GIRLS?

29:20.300 --> 29:23.000
I'M CHECKING THEIR CASE FILES
AGAINST ROGER'S MERCURY

29:23.000 --> 29:24.400
AND HIS WHEREABOUTS
FIVE YEARS AGO.

29:24.600 --> 29:26.100
IF OUR SCUMBAG
KILLED THOSE GIRLS,

29:26.100 --> 29:27.900
HE PROBABLY BURIED THEM
IN THE PARK.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.800
HE KNOWS THE PLACE
INSIDE AND OUT.

29:30.100 --> 29:31.700
THEN WHY DIDN'T HE
BURY RUBY?

29:32.100 --> 29:34.100
HE PROBABLY PANICKED
WHEN HE HEARD OUR HELICOPTERS,

29:34.400 --> 29:35.500
LEFT HER IN THE DITCH.

29:35.500 --> 29:37.700
I'M TELLING YOU, CHIEF --
THOSE GIRLS ARE OUT THERE.

29:38.400 --> 29:41.200
GRIFFITH PARK
IS OVER 4,000 ACRES.

29:41.700 --> 29:43.500
WE'D NEVER FIND THEM
WITHOUT ROGER'S HELP.

29:43.500 --> 29:44.500
SO, WE GET HIM TO TELL US.

29:45.400 --> 29:46.400
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

29:46.700 --> 29:49.400
IT WORKED WITH RUBY. WHY NOT
WITH THESE PREVIOUS TWO GIRLS?

29:49.600 --> 29:50.900
GET GABRIEL,
HAVE HIM TALK TO HIM --

29:50.900 --> 29:54.000
IT'S NOT...THAT...SIMPLE.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.600
WELL, THEN,
WHAT AM I MISSING?

29:59.300 --> 30:00.200
EXCUSE ME, EVERYONE.

30:00.700 --> 30:01.600
I WANTED TO, UH,

30:02.400 --> 30:05.300
THANK ALL OF YOU PERSONALLY
FOR YOUR HARD WORK AND DEDICATION.

30:06.000 --> 30:06.900
I KNOW IT'S, UH...

30:08.300 --> 30:09.100
IT'S JUST AWFUL

30:09.100 --> 30:11.300
WHEN AN INVESTIGATION
ENDS THE WAY THIS ONE DID.

30:11.900 --> 30:14.200
PHD HANDLED IT QUICKLY,
PROFESSIONALLY,

30:14.700 --> 30:16.200
AND YOU GOT A PREDATOR
OFF THE STREET.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.100
THANK YOU,
CHIEF POPE.

30:19.500 --> 30:20.800
DO WE HAVE A BOOKING PHOTO
OF THE SUSPECT?

30:20.800 --> 30:22.300
I'D LIKE TO RELEASE IT
TO THE PRESS.

30:22.300 --> 30:25.900
UH...THERE'S BEEN
A...SLIGHT COMPLICATION.

30:27.100 --> 30:27.800
WHAT'S THAT?

30:29.200 --> 30:31.800
WELL, THERE'S SOME QUESTION
AS TO WHETHER ROGER'S CONFESSION

30:31.800 --> 30:33.700
<i>CAME AFTER HE INVOKED
HIS RIGHT TO COUNSEL.</i>

30:34.300 --> 30:36.300
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.
IF HE INVOKED, HE INVOKED.

30:36.400 --> 30:37.900
<i>IF HE CONFESSED,
HE REVOKED, RIGHT?</i>

30:38.100 --> 30:39.700
UH, IT FELL
SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN.

30:40.200 --> 30:42.900
AND, UNFORTUNATELY,
WE DIDN'T GET IT ON TAPE.

30:43.500 --> 30:46.400
IT DOESN'T HURT US TOO BAD,
BUT THE THING IS, CHIEF,

30:46.600 --> 30:48.600
WE THINK
THIS GUY ROGER'S RESPONSIBLE

30:48.600 --> 30:50.800
FOR AT LEAST
TWO OTHER CHILD ABDUCTIONS.

30:51.100 --> 30:54.600
WE DON'T WANT TO TAINT OTHER
WITNESSES BY RELEASING ROGER'S PHOTO.

30:54.800 --> 30:57.400
SO WE'RE GOING TO KEEP
HIS IDENTITY UNDER WRAPS

30:57.400 --> 30:59.900
UNTIL WE'RE DONE
WITH THE INVESTIGATION.

31:01.400 --> 31:02.000
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.800
BUT I WANT THIS SORTED OUT
BY THE TIME HE'S ARRAIGNED

31:03.800 --> 31:05.900
SO I CAN SMEAR HIS FACE
ALL OVER THE NEWS.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.900
COMMANDER TAYLOR AND I
ARE POOLING OUR RESOURCES.

31:10.800 --> 31:11.500
OKAY. GOOD.

31:12.100 --> 31:13.000
THANK YOU, COMMANDER.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.300
CHIEF JOHNSON,
YOU WANTED TO TALK?

31:20.900 --> 31:22.900
GABRIEL LET HIS EMOTIONS
GET THE BETTER OF HIM.

31:22.900 --> 31:24.600
IT'S HAPPENED
TO ALL OF US.

31:25.800 --> 31:28.400
WHAT GABRIEL DID WAS, UH...
IT WAS IMMATURE.

31:28.500 --> 31:29.700
IT WASN'T JUST IMMATURE.

31:30.800 --> 31:32.000
HE ACTED IN SUCH A WAY

31:32.000 --> 31:33.800
THAT I NOW CAN'T SEE
HOW TO CLOSE MY CASE

31:33.800 --> 31:36.200
WITHOUT PERMANENTLY DAMAGING
HIS CAREER.

31:36.500 --> 31:40.200
<i>AND MAKE NO MISTAKE, COMMANDER,
I WILL CLOSE MY CASE.</i>

31:40.200 --> 31:41.300
WHOA.

31:42.200 --> 31:45.000
LET'S NOT FORGET --
GABRIEL'S NOT THE BAD GUY HERE.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.700
THERE'S A CHILD KILLER
IN THE MIX.

31:46.700 --> 31:48.300
WHOSE ADMISSION
I CAN'T USE.

31:50.600 --> 31:52.800
TOO BAD YOU CAN'T GET ROGER
TO CONFESS AGAIN.

31:53.800 --> 31:54.500
BELIEVE ME...

31:55.700 --> 31:58.100
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO DO THAT ALL NIGHT.

32:00.900 --> 32:02.400
YOU HAVEN'T
BOOKED THE SUSPECT YET?

32:02.800 --> 32:04.600
NO. HE'S STILL
IN ISOLATION.

32:06.500 --> 32:07.900
YOU KNOW WHAT, CHIEF?

32:10.500 --> 32:11.800
YOU HAVE A LOT TO DO
STILL,

32:12.600 --> 32:16.300
WHAT WITH HAVING TO LOOK AFTER
THESE OTHER TWO MISSING GIRLS.

32:17.400 --> 32:19.400
WHY DON'T I TAKE ROGER
OFF YOUR HANDS?

32:19.900 --> 32:21.500
HAVE ROBBERY HOMICIDE
BOOK HIM.

32:23.800 --> 32:25.100
I DON'T SEE
HOW THAT'S GONNA HELP ME.

32:25.600 --> 32:27.600
OH...IT WILL.

32:29.700 --> 32:30.500
IT WILL.

32:48.400 --> 32:49.100
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME,
CHIEF?

32:49.700 --> 32:53.100
YES. LIEUTENANT, WHAT HAVE
WE GOT ON ROGER'S SECOND CAR?

32:54.200 --> 32:55.400
SO FAR, NADA.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.500
S.I.D. TOOK SOME FIBERS,

32:57.500 --> 32:59.000
AND THEY'RE LOOKING
FOR BLOOD, HAIR,

32:59.000 --> 33:01.700
ANYTHING THAT'LL MATCH ONE OF
THE GIRLS FROM FIVE YEARS AGO.

33:02.500 --> 33:04.100
IT'LL TAKE WEEKS,
IF IT WORKS AT ALL.

33:05.100 --> 33:05.600
THANK YOU.

33:07.600 --> 33:09.500
CHIEF...UM...

33:17.300 --> 33:18.800
I DID A BAD THING ONCE.

33:20.500 --> 33:21.800
<i>I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE FIRST TIME.</i>

33:23.000 --> 33:24.100
IT WAS MANY YEARS AGO.

33:25.100 --> 33:27.000
I WAS VERY YOUNG,
LIKE GABRIEL,

33:27.800 --> 33:28.600
AND MY HEART --

33:30.500 --> 33:31.900
<i>BACK WHEN
I HAD A HEART --</i>

33:32.500 --> 33:33.600
WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

33:34.800 --> 33:36.900
BUT I WAS STUBBORN,
I WAS STUPID, AND...

33:38.900 --> 33:40.900
I DID SOMETHING
THAT I'M NOT PROUD OF.

33:44.600 --> 33:45.200
BUT...

33:46.400 --> 33:48.100
PEOPLE GROW.

33:48.200 --> 33:49.600
PEOPLE CHANGE.

33:50.300 --> 33:51.000
AND...

33:52.900 --> 33:55.200
<i>WELL...
LOOK AT ME NOW.</i>

33:59.700 --> 34:02.000
EXCUSE ME, CHIEF.
WE JUST GOT A CALL FROM LOCKUP.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.400
ROGER WANTS TO TALK
TO YOU.

34:03.500 --> 34:04.200
<i>TO ME?</i>

34:04.300 --> 34:06.400
YES. COMMANDER TAYLOR'S
BRINGING HIM UP RIGHT NOW.

34:08.600 --> 34:10.100
I'M HERE
TO PROTECT AND SERVE.

34:10.100 --> 34:12.300
YOU'RE NOT PROTECTING ME.

34:12.400 --> 34:15.400
I WANTED YOU OUT OF THERE
SO YOU'D BE SAFE.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

34:19.199 --> 34:19.900
WHAT HAPPENED?!

34:20.400 --> 34:21.400
HE DID THIS TO ME!

34:22.100 --> 34:24.199
HE PUT ME IN THE CELL
WITH OTHER PRISONERS!

34:24.699 --> 34:26.000
SOMETIMES YOU FORGET

34:26.000 --> 34:28.500
HOW OTHER PRISONERS
TREAT PEOPLE LIKE ROGER.

34:29.600 --> 34:31.100
HOW DID THEY FIND OUT
WHO HE WAS?

34:31.100 --> 34:34.600
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE SOME GUARD
MUST HAVE SAID SOMETHING.

34:34.600 --> 34:37.800
ISN'T THERE A RULE AGAINST PUTTING
CHILD MOLESTERS IN GENERAL POPULATION?

34:38.199 --> 34:39.800
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WAIT A MINUTE.

34:39.800 --> 34:42.900
IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE, ROGER?
ARE YOU A CHILD MOLESTER?

34:42.900 --> 34:45.100
I DIDN'T --
'CAUSE BEFORE,YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T.

34:45.100 --> 34:47.100
YOU DENIED EVERYTHING.
WHAT'S IT GONNA BE?

34:47.300 --> 34:49.600
ARE YOU A CHILD MOLESTER
OR NOT?!

34:49.900 --> 34:53.100
WHAT ARE YOU, ROGER?!
DO YOU LIKE LITTLE GIRLS, HUH?!

34:53.199 --> 34:56.300
WHAT ARE YOU, ROGER?!
ARE YOU A CHILD MOLESTER?!

34:56.300 --> 34:57.600
HE TOLD THEM ABOUT ME!

34:57.600 --> 34:58.400
ALL RIGHT!

34:58.900 --> 35:00.800
MR. STIMPLE,
DO NOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION!

35:00.800 --> 35:02.200
COMMANDER, THAT'S ENOUGH.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.600
SORRY. SORRY, CHIEF.

35:10.100 --> 35:11.100
PLEASE HELP ME.

35:11.300 --> 35:12.900
<i>I CAN'T DO ANYTHING
FOR YOU!</i>

35:13.200 --> 35:14.300
I CAN'T EVEN TALK TO YOU,

35:14.300 --> 35:15.500
BECAUSE
YOU'VE ASKED FOR A LAWYER!

35:17.300 --> 35:18.400
I WANT TO TALK.

35:23.300 --> 35:24.000
OKAY.

35:25.000 --> 35:25.800
FINE.

35:27.400 --> 35:29.000
LET'S GET A DOCTOR
TO TAKE A LOOK AT YOU,

35:29.700 --> 35:30.700
AND THEN WE'LL TALK.

35:33.900 --> 35:35.900
NO. NOT HIM.

35:38.900 --> 35:40.500
CAN'T WE JUST
KEEP THIS WHITE?

35:46.400 --> 35:47.100
LET'S GO.

35:54.400 --> 35:55.200
<i>THANK YOU, DOCTOR.</i>

36:03.500 --> 36:06.900
<i>ROGER, JUST TO BE
PERFECTLY CLEAR,</i>

36:08.200 --> 36:10.300
<i>YOU ARE NOW SAYING
THAT YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME.</i>

36:10.400 --> 36:11.100
OUCH.

36:11.500 --> 36:12.500
<i>IN FACT, YOU ASKED TO TALK.</i>

36:12.500 --> 36:15.300
I HEARD HE HAD A LITTLE SCUFFLE
IN THE GENERAL POPULATION.

36:15.900 --> 36:18.800
HONESTLY, CHIEF, THERE WAS
NO SAFE PLACE TO PUT THIS GUY.

36:18.800 --> 36:21.200
<i>YOU DON'T HAVE TO TALK TO ME
WITHOUT YOUR ATTORNEY PRESENT.</i>

36:21.800 --> 36:23.000
<i>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, TOO?</i>

36:23.400 --> 36:24.200
<i>UH-HUH.</i>

36:26.300 --> 36:27.000
<i>OKAY.</i>

36:28.500 --> 36:29.900
<i>AGAIN,
JUST FOR THE RECORD,</i>

36:31.000 --> 36:32.300
YOU WERE JUST TREATED
BY A DOCTOR

36:33.200 --> 36:34.900
FOR WOUNDS
YOU SAY YOU RECEIVED

36:34.900 --> 36:36.900
FROM YOUR FELLOW PRISONERS
IN YOUR HOLDING CELL.

36:37.200 --> 36:38.600
THEY ATTACKED
AND BEAT YOU.

36:38.600 --> 36:40.600
THEY'RE GONNA KILL ME!
THEY'RE GONNA KILL ME!

36:40.800 --> 36:42.100
I CAN'T GO BACK DOWN THERE!

36:42.100 --> 36:44.400
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY, ROGER.

36:44.400 --> 36:45.700
I WON'T SEND YOU BACK.

36:46.500 --> 36:48.800
I SWEAR.
YOU'RE SAFE WITH ME.

36:50.900 --> 36:54.900
AND I PROMISE YOU,
I WILL LOOK INTO WHOEVER DID TO YOU, OKAY?

36:56.300 --> 36:57.000
OKAY?

37:00.400 --> 37:01.000
ROGER...

37:03.100 --> 37:04.700
LET'S YOU AND I
TALK ABOUT RUBY.

37:07.200 --> 37:09.000
BECAUSE WE LOOKED FOR HER
BY THE PAY PHONES,

37:09.000 --> 37:09.900
BUT SHE WASN'T THERE.

37:15.100 --> 37:16.300
I WANT TO HELP Y'ALL
FIND HER.

37:18.300 --> 37:19.400
LOOK, I MADE A MISTAKE.

37:19.700 --> 37:21.300
I WAS WRONG
NOT TO TALK TO Y'ALL BEFORE.

37:21.900 --> 37:23.800
ALL I KNOW IS,
I WAS DRIVING THROUGH THE PARK,

37:23.800 --> 37:24.800
AND THERE SHE WAS,

37:26.100 --> 37:27.700
JUST WALKING ALONE,
BY HERSELF.

37:27.900 --> 37:28.600
IN THE PARK?

37:29.100 --> 37:29.700
YEAH.

37:30.500 --> 37:31.700
AND I USED TO WORK
IN THAT PARK.

37:31.700 --> 37:34.100
IT'S NOT SAFE FOR A KID
TO WALK AROUND ALONE LIKE THAT.

37:34.400 --> 37:35.900
SO I OFFERED HER A LIFT.

37:37.100 --> 37:38.900
THAT'S WHY YOUR DOGS
SMELLED HER IN MY VAN.

37:42.100 --> 37:43.500
SHE WANTED
TO CALL HER FOLKS.

37:44.200 --> 37:47.000
SO I-I TOOK A SERVICE ROAD
THAT I KNOW,

37:47.800 --> 37:48.900
AND I DROPPED HER OFF
BY THE PHONES.

37:48.900 --> 37:51.300
I GAVE HER SOME CHANGE
TO CALL HOME,

37:52.000 --> 37:53.100
AND THEN I TOOK OFF.

37:54.900 --> 37:57.400
I'M TELLING YOU,
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

38:00.100 --> 38:02.800
DO YOU REMEMBER --
WAS SHE WEARING HER PINK JACKET?

38:04.300 --> 38:04.900
YEAH.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.100
YEAH, THAT SOUNDS RIGHT.

38:12.700 --> 38:14.000
SHE HAD HER HANDS
IN HER POCKETS.

38:15.400 --> 38:17.000
AND ABOUT WHAT TIME
WAS THIS?

38:18.500 --> 38:21.300
I THINK -- I THINK
IT WAS MAYBE AROUND 12:00.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.400
AND YOU NEVER
GOT OUT OF YOUR VAN?

38:24.000 --> 38:24.800
NO.

38:25.900 --> 38:27.000
THIS EXPLAINS A LOT --

38:27.800 --> 38:29.000
HOW SHE GOT IN YOUR VAN,

38:29.200 --> 38:31.000
WHY SHE WAS IN
THAT REMOTE PART OF THE PARK.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.600
YEAH. YEAH.
I WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP.

38:33.600 --> 38:35.900
AND YOU'RE HELPING NOW.
YOU'RE HELPING A LOT.

38:37.400 --> 38:39.200
BECAUSE, ROGER...

38:40.500 --> 38:43.900
...YOU'RE PROBABLY THE LAST
PERSON TO SEE RUBY ALIVE.

38:44.400 --> 38:46.000
YOU SEE, WE DIDN'T FIND HER
BY THE PAY PHONES,

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
BUT WE DID FIND HER.

38:48.600 --> 38:49.800
SHE WAS DEAD, ROGER.

38:52.500 --> 38:53.200
OH, MAN.

38:55.300 --> 38:56.300
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

38:58.700 --> 39:00.400
DID YOU SEE ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS
IN THE PARK,

39:01.200 --> 39:04.500
A CAR THAT DIDN'T BELONG
OR SOMEONE WALKING AROUND?

39:07.200 --> 39:07.800
YEAH.

39:08.600 --> 39:10.200
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
THIS COULD BE NOTHING,

39:11.800 --> 39:14.400
BUT THERE WAS
THIS ONE DUDE I SAW

39:14.800 --> 39:16.000
AS WE WERE HEADING
TO THE PHONES.

39:17.600 --> 39:22.100
HE'S A YOUNG GUY,
MAYBE 20, 25.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.700
HE WAS BLACK OR HISPANIC.

39:24.700 --> 39:27.500
YOU KNOW, KIND OF CUBAN BLACK,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

39:28.200 --> 39:29.100
HE'S A BIG GUY.

39:30.900 --> 39:31.500
OH, MAN.

39:34.200 --> 39:35.500
THERE ARE BAD PEOPLE
OUT THERE.

39:39.400 --> 39:40.000
ROGER...

39:41.200 --> 39:43.100
YOU SAY YOU SAW RUBY
IN THE PARK AROUND NOON.

39:43.900 --> 39:45.500
THAT'S WHEN HER TEACHERS
SAW HER LEAVING SCHOOL.

39:47.300 --> 39:47.900
WELL...

39:48.000 --> 39:49.500
THE SAME TIME
WE GOT PICTURES

39:49.500 --> 39:51.400
<i>OF YOUR VAN
DRIVING IN HER NEIGHBORHOOD.</i>

39:51.400 --> 39:52.100
I DRIVE ALL AROUND.

39:52.100 --> 39:53.600
YOU SAY YOU DIDN'T
GET OUT OF YOUR VAN,

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
BUT WE'VE GOT
YOUR FOOTPRINTS ALL OVER.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
THAT DOESN'T
MEAN ANYTHING!

39:57.000 --> 39:59.200
AND YOU SAY YOU SAW RUBY
IN HER PINK JACKET,

39:59.800 --> 40:03.400
WHICH WE FOUND IN THE ALLEYWAY
WHERE SHE WAS ABDUCTED.

40:04.400 --> 40:06.300
NOW, IT IS HIGH TIME
THAT YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH.

40:08.800 --> 40:09.900
THE WHOLE TRUTH, ROGER.

40:11.700 --> 40:12.300
PLEASE.

40:14.200 --> 40:15.700
LET'S YOU AND I
HELP EACH OTHER.

40:18.200 --> 40:19.000
OTHERWISE...

40:19.800 --> 40:21.100
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT
TO TALK ABOUT.

40:29.400 --> 40:31.300
ALL RIGHT. I'M GONNA GO FIND
COMMANDER TAYLOR.

40:31.300 --> 40:34.100
- NO!DON'T SEND ME BACK THERE!
- WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?!

40:35.600 --> 40:37.800
IT'S SO HARD.

40:40.400 --> 40:41.000
LOOK.

40:41.800 --> 40:42.600
ROGER.

40:43.400 --> 40:46.500
YOU AGREED TO TALK TO ME.
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.600
NOW LET ME HELP YOU
MAKE THE NEXT ONE.

40:48.800 --> 40:51.800
BECAUSE I KNOW -- I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

40:52.900 --> 40:54.100
'CAUSE GIRLS THAT AGE...

40:56.300 --> 40:58.200
THEY ARE SO BEAUTIFUL.

41:03.400 --> 41:06.700
OTHER GUYS, THEY PRETEND THAT
THEY DON'T FEEL THE SAME WAY,

41:06.900 --> 41:07.600
BUT THEY DO.

41:10.900 --> 41:12.300
AND THE GIRLS WANT IT,
TOO.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.300
THEY JUST CAN'T ADMIT IT...

41:18.700 --> 41:20.400
BECAUSE THEIR MOTHERS
WOULD PASS JUDGMENT.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.700
BUT I'M NOT
PASSING JUDGMENT, ROGER.

41:26.200 --> 41:27.500
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

41:32.800 --> 41:34.000
I WAS DRIVING AROUND,

41:35.800 --> 41:37.400
AND I SEEN THIS GIRL
I SEEN BEFORE.

41:38.800 --> 41:40.100
YOU COULDN'T HELP
BUT NOTICE HER.

41:41.600 --> 41:43.100
AND I DON'T GO FOR GIRLS
WHO DON'T WANT ME.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.100
I'VE BEEN ON THE OTHER END
OF THAT THING WHEN I WAS A KID.

41:48.500 --> 41:50.100
NO. SHE'S INTO IT.

41:50.600 --> 41:52.300
ALL YOU WERE DOING
WAS GIVING HER A RIDE.

41:52.300 --> 41:53.200
EXACTLY.

41:54.600 --> 41:55.800
WE WERE JUST
DRIVING AROUND.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.200
IT WAS ALL JUST FUN,
YOU KNOW?

41:59.700 --> 42:00.900
I WASN'T GONNA DO ANYTHING.

42:02.400 --> 42:03.400
BUT SHE WANTED IT.

42:04.500 --> 42:05.300
SO...

42:06.200 --> 42:07.400
SHE WAS FLIRTING
WITH YOU.

42:09.800 --> 42:10.900
YOU TWO FOOL AROUND?

42:15.600 --> 42:17.300
THEN RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT,
SHE CHANGED.

42:22.300 --> 42:23.300
SHE GOT ALL MAD AT ME.

42:25.300 --> 42:27.000
SAID SHE WAS GONNA TELL THE COPS
WHAT WE DONE.

42:28.800 --> 42:30.300
WHICH IS SO PERFECT --

42:32.000 --> 42:35.500
JUST LEAD ME ON AND...
THEN JUST FLIP LIKE THAT.

42:39.100 --> 42:40.000
AND I GOT MAD.

42:41.600 --> 42:42.400
ROGER...

42:43.500 --> 42:44.500
IF SOMETHING HAPPENED --

42:45.200 --> 42:47.600
IF THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT,
YOU NEED TO TELL ME.

42:48.800 --> 42:49.700
'CAUSE THE DNA...

42:50.900 --> 42:52.200
THAT'S GONNA LINK YOU
TO RUBY,

42:53.700 --> 42:55.800
AND THE D.A.'s GONNA
MAKE YOU OUT TO BE A MONSTER

42:55.800 --> 42:58.000
<i>IN A VERY PUBLIC TRIAL.</i>

42:59.500 --> 43:01.300
IS THAT HOW YOU WANT
YOUR MOTHER TO SEE YOU?

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
IS THAT HOW YOU WANT
THE WORLD TO SEE YOU?

43:06.900 --> 43:10.900
<i>I KNOW THAT THERE'S AN
EXPLANATION THAT ONLY YOU HAVE,</i>

43:10.900 --> 43:13.300
AND I WANT TO HEAR
YOUR SIDE OF THE STORY.

43:14.100 --> 43:16.800
BUT IF I'M GONNA HELP YOU,
I NEED TO HEAR IT FROM YOU.

43:24.600 --> 43:26.900
SHE JUST STARTED
SCREAMING.

43:28.200 --> 43:30.500
SHE WAS MAKING
SO MUCH NOISE.

43:33.600 --> 43:35.900
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO KEEP HER QUIET.

43:39.500 --> 43:40.800
I DIDN'T WANT
TO HURT HER.

43:44.100 --> 43:45.100
BUT HER NECK...

43:46.700 --> 43:49.600
IT SNAPPED...SO EASY.
