WEBVTT

00:11.967 --> 00:13.433
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...
HER OR ME.

00:13.467 --> 00:16.800
I NEED HIM TO STOP
TALKING TO MEREDITH.

00:16.833 --> 00:19.033
YOU'RE STAYING WITH HER.
SHE'S MY WIFE.

00:19.067 --> 00:21.067
I BROKE UP WITH DEREK.

00:21.100 --> 00:23.133
SO WHERE ARE WE?
WE ARE A COUPLE.

00:23.167 --> 00:25.067
I KNOW THE RULES,
BUT I DON'T WANT

00:25.100 --> 00:28.133
TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP
THAT'S SECRET.

00:28.167 --> 00:29.467
BOYS ARE STUPID.

00:31.167 --> 00:34.033
WHAT, YOU GOT A DATE?
YES. YES, I DO.

00:34.067 --> 00:36.367
YOU'RE MARRIED?
TEN YEARS TODAY.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.767
HOW COME I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE MARRIED?
YOU NEVER ASKED.

00:40.800 --> 00:43.567
***

00:43.600 --> 00:45.100
In the eighth grade

00:45.133 --> 00:49.433
MY ENGLISH CLASS HAD TO READ
"ROMEO AND JULIET."

00:49.467 --> 00:51.033
THEN FOR EXTRA CREDIT,

00:51.067 --> 00:53.767
MRS. SNYDER MADE US
ACT OUT ALL THE PARTS.

00:53.800 --> 00:57.267
***

00:57.300 --> 01:00.700
SAL SCAFFARILLO WAS ROMEO.

01:00.733 --> 01:05.233
AS FATE WOULD HAVE IT,
I WAS JULIET.

01:13.433 --> 01:15.333
ALL THE OTHER GIRLS
WERE JEALOUS,

01:15.367 --> 01:19.233
BUT I HAD
A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TAKE.

01:19.267 --> 01:22.067
I TOLD MRS. SNYDER
THAT JULIET WAS AN IDIOT.

01:26.467 --> 01:27.800
FOR STARTERS,

01:27.833 --> 01:30.700
SHE FALLS FOR THE ONE GUY
SHE KNOWS SHE CAN'T HAVE,

01:30.733 --> 01:34.233
THEN SHE BLAMES FATE
FOR HER OWN BAD DECISION.

01:38.133 --> 01:39.600
YOU KISSED ME.
YES, I DID.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.133
SHOULD WE--I MEAN...

01:41.167 --> 01:43.067
THERE'S A DISCUSSION
WE COULD HAVE

01:43.067 --> 01:44.800
IF YOU WANTED TO HAVE
ONE BE--

01:44.833 --> 01:47.100
IZZIE, I KISSED YOU
WITH TONGUE,

01:47.133 --> 01:50.533
AND I PLAN TO DO IT
AGAIN AND AGAIN.

01:50.567 --> 01:52.233
GET USED TO IT.

01:52.267 --> 01:54.167
END OF DISCUSSION.

01:57.867 --> 01:59.433
OKAY.

01:59.467 --> 02:02.200
MRS. SNYDER EXPLAINED TO ME
THAT WHEN FATE COMES INTO PLAY,

02:02.233 --> 02:05.267
CHOICE SOMETIMES
GOES OUT THE WINDOW.

02:05.300 --> 02:07.467
GOD.

02:12.567 --> 02:13.500
CONGRATULATIONS.

02:13.533 --> 02:15.200
UH, ON WHAT?

02:15.233 --> 02:16.400
YOUR FELLOWSHIPS.

02:16.433 --> 02:18.067
FIVE APPLICATIONS,
FIVE OFFERS.

02:18.100 --> 02:19.833
DO YOU KNOW
HOW RARE THAT IS?

02:19.867 --> 02:21.200
THIS IS YOUR YEAR.

02:21.233 --> 02:23.133
EVERYBODY WANTS
TO DANCE WITH YOU.

02:23.167 --> 02:26.367
OF COURSE, SEATTLE GRACE'S
FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM IS THE BEST.

02:26.400 --> 02:28.200
OH, YEAH.

02:28.233 --> 02:31.100
YEAH. AHEM.

02:34.833 --> 02:37.267
YOU ARE TAKING
MY FELLOWSHIP, AREN'T YOU?

02:37.300 --> 02:39.200
I... DON'T KNOW.

02:39.233 --> 02:42.367
I-I HAVEN'T MADE
A DECISION YET.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.300
AT THE RIPE OLD AGE OF 13,

02:44.333 --> 02:46.233
I WAS VERY CLEAR THAT LOVE,
LIKE LIFE,

02:46.267 --> 02:47.433
IS ABOUT MAKING CHOICES...

02:47.467 --> 02:49.367
I WOULD NOT WISH THIS
ON ANYONE.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.300
LITERALLY, IT'S LIKE
SOMEONE REACHED IN

02:51.333 --> 02:53.567
AND RIPPED MY GUTS OUT.
BABY, YOU HAD
FOOD POISONING.

02:53.600 --> 02:56.600
I HAD ONE LOUSY
RESTAURANT CLAM.

02:56.633 --> 02:58.567
WAIT A MINUTE,

02:58.600 --> 03:00.267
WHERE'S BILLING AGAIN?

03:00.300 --> 03:02.200
THE BASEMENT.
THE BASEMENT.

03:02.233 --> 03:04.100
AND FATE HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

03:04.133 --> 03:06.567
WE'RE GOING THE WRONG WAY.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.267
(horn honks)

03:08.300 --> 03:09.233
COFFEE?

03:09.267 --> 03:11.200
OH, THANK YOU.

03:11.233 --> 03:12.633
IT'S DATE NIGHT.

03:12.667 --> 03:16.067
YEAH, IT'S A NIGHT,
UH, WITH A DATE.

03:16.067 --> 03:17.367
YOU FORGOT.

03:17.400 --> 03:18.333
NO.

03:18.367 --> 03:20.267
YES.

03:20.300 --> 03:23.167
YOU WANT TO CANCEL?

03:23.200 --> 03:25.233
NO.

03:30.567 --> 03:32.300
EVERYONE THINKS
IT'S SO ROMANTIC--

03:32.333 --> 03:33.833
ROMEO AND JULIET,

03:33.867 --> 03:37.133
TRUE LOVE, HOW SAD.

03:37.167 --> 03:38.767
OH!

03:38.800 --> 03:40.500
CRAP!

03:40.533 --> 03:43.533
IF JULIET WAS STUPID ENOUGH
TO FALL FOR THE ENEMY,

03:43.567 --> 03:47.400
DRINK A BOTTLE OF POISON AND GO
TO SLEEP IN A MAUSOLEUM...

03:47.433 --> 03:48.633
WHAT...

03:48.667 --> 03:51.133
SHE DESERVED
WHATEVER SHE GOT.

03:51.167 --> 03:54.067
***

03:54.067 --> 03:58.633
(Woman) * NOBODY KNOWS
WHERE THEY MIGHT END UP *

03:58.667 --> 04:01.667
* NOBODY KNOWS

04:12.633 --> 04:14.433
* OH, OH

04:14.467 --> 04:18.267
* SUPPOSE YOU'LL NEVER KNOW

04:21.733 --> 04:25.433
WINDOW WASHER FELL
FROM FIFTH FLOOR SCAFFOLDING,

04:25.467 --> 04:26.167
OBVIOUS OPEN TIB/FIB FRACTURE,

04:26.200 --> 04:27.833
BUT OTHERWISE, OKAY.

04:27.867 --> 04:29.367
EQUAL BREATH SOUNDS.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.300
AFTER A 5-STORY FALL,
HE'S GOT EQUAL BREATH SOUNDS.

04:31.333 --> 04:33.233
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
DO YOU WANT TO HEAR?

04:33.267 --> 04:34.600
SOMEHOW, I BELIEVE YOU.

04:34.633 --> 04:36.533
YANG, GET IN THERE
AND PALPATE HIS ABDOMEN.

04:36.567 --> 04:38.800
DOES THIS HURT ANYWHERE?

04:38.833 --> 04:40.433
NO.
YOU FELL FROM THE SKY--

04:40.467 --> 04:42.567
FIVE STORIES--AND YOU
ONLY INJURED YOUR LEG.

04:42.600 --> 04:44.100
(mutters) GEORGE.

04:44.133 --> 04:45.467
NO, DON'T "GEORGE" ME.

04:45.500 --> 04:47.400
A FEW SECONDS EARLIER,
HE WOULD'VE LANDED ON ME.

04:47.433 --> 04:49.467
OKAY,
ROLLING ON THREE, PLEASE.

04:49.500 --> 04:52.300
ONE, TWO, THREE.
EWW.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.367
OH.

04:54.400 --> 04:55.733
ARE THESE FEATHERS?

04:55.767 --> 04:57.667
MY LIFE WAS SAVED
BY THAT PIGEON.

04:57.700 --> 04:59.267
LET'S GET SOME X-RAYS,

04:59.300 --> 05:01.533
AND AFTER THAT,
YOU MIGHT WANNA GET IN THERE

05:01.567 --> 05:04.200
AND LOOK FOR THE REST
OF TWEETY.

05:04.233 --> 05:06.200
THANK YOU.

05:06.233 --> 05:09.100
ESME WANTED TO WAIT UNTIL
TOMORROW TO SEE HER DOCTOR,

05:09.133 --> 05:12.400
BUT SHE HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO KEEP
ANYTHING DOWN SINCE YESTERDAY,

05:12.433 --> 05:14.067
SO I BROUGHT HER IN.

05:14.067 --> 05:16.200
OKAY, MRS. SORRENTO,

05:16.233 --> 05:18.400
YOU HAVE
ACUTE CHOLECYSTITIS,

05:18.433 --> 05:20.067
WHICH MEANS
THAT YOUR GALLBLADDER

05:20.100 --> 05:21.267
MAY HAVE TO COME OUT.

05:21.300 --> 05:22.800
SHE HAS GALLSTONES?

05:22.833 --> 05:25.067
HE WATCHES CABLE.
HE THINKS HE'S A DOCTOR.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.667
I'M GIVING YOU ANTIBIOTICS

05:28.700 --> 05:31.667
AND I.V. FLUIDS TO COOL
THE GALLBLADDER DOWN.

05:31.700 --> 05:33.567
AND THEN I'M GONNA GO
CALL DR. BAILEY,

05:33.600 --> 05:36.367
AND I'M GOING TO SEE IF SURGERY
IS THE BEST WAY FOR US TO GO.

05:36.400 --> 05:37.733
DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS?

05:37.767 --> 05:40.567
HONEY, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR FOREHEAD?

05:40.600 --> 05:43.367
NOTHING.

05:43.400 --> 05:46.267
I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU,
I DON'T NEED AN APPOINTMENT.

05:46.300 --> 05:49.067
I AM NOT A PATIENT.
I AM A FRIEND FROM NEW YORK.

05:49.100 --> 05:50.667
WEISS?

05:50.700 --> 05:53.533
DEREK.
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.

05:53.567 --> 05:55.467
SAV.
HEY, GIRLY.

05:55.500 --> 05:57.367
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOU WERE...

05:57.400 --> 05:58.500
OHH.

05:58.533 --> 06:00.833
IF I KNEW YOU WERE COMING,
I WOULD'VE TAKEN THE DAY OFF.

06:00.867 --> 06:02.633
WELL, IT'S KIND OF
LAST MINUTE.

06:02.667 --> 06:05.100
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

06:06.600 --> 06:09.200
A MONTH AGO, HER MOTHER DIED.
OVARIAN CANCER.

06:09.233 --> 06:11.667
CATHERINE DIED?

06:11.700 --> 06:15.067
I'M SORRY.

06:15.067 --> 06:18.200
AND SAVVY, SHE'S--I MEAN,
YOU KNOW HOW CLOSE THEY WERE.

06:18.233 --> 06:20.100
I MEAN,
ALL SHE CAN THINK ABOUT

06:20.133 --> 06:22.067
IS THIS BREAST
AND OVARIAN CANCER GENE.

06:22.067 --> 06:23.067
B.R.C.A.

06:23.100 --> 06:24.600
A POSITIVE TEST RESULT

06:24.633 --> 06:28.167
ISN'T THE END
OF THE WORLD, SAV.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.100
IT JUST MEANS YOU HAVE
A GENE MUTATION

06:30.133 --> 06:31.467
THAT COULD--

06:31.500 --> 06:32.833
I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

06:32.867 --> 06:34.767
I'VE TALKED
TO THE GENETIC COUNSELOR,

06:34.800 --> 06:36.700
I'VE BEEN TO MY GYNECOLOGIST,

06:36.733 --> 06:38.567
AND NOW I'M HERE.

06:42.833 --> 06:46.267
ADDIE, YOU'RE THE BEST SURGEON
THERE IS.

06:46.300 --> 06:47.400
TRUE.

06:47.433 --> 06:49.367
(laughs)

06:49.400 --> 06:51.500
BUT THIS ISN'T SURGICAL.

06:51.533 --> 06:53.067
YES, IT IS.

06:53.100 --> 06:55.167
NO, SAV. YOU UNDERSTAND,
YOU DON'T HAVE CANCER?

06:55.200 --> 06:57.500
AND I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF GETTING IT.

07:02.733 --> 07:04.767
SO YOU WANT ME...

07:04.800 --> 07:06.767
I WANT YOU TO TAKE OUT
MY OVARIES

07:06.800 --> 07:08.300
AND THE UTERUS,

07:08.333 --> 07:10.267
AND WHEN THAT'S DONE...

07:10.300 --> 07:12.200
YOU'RE GONNA FIND
THE BEST PERSON OUT THERE

07:12.233 --> 07:14.400
TO CUT OFF MY BREASTS.

07:25.333 --> 07:26.267
BEAK.

07:26.300 --> 07:27.400
CLAW.
CLAW.

07:27.433 --> 07:30.400
WE NEED TO WIDEN THIS INCISION
TO TAKE A BETTER LOOK.

07:30.433 --> 07:32.667
ALL RIGHT.

07:32.700 --> 07:34.600
DOES YOUR LEG HURT
A LOT?

07:34.633 --> 07:39.433
I'M FINE, MAN.
JUST... DO YOUR THING.

07:39.467 --> 07:41.367
IS THERE ANYONE
YOU'D LIKE ME TO CALL?

07:41.400 --> 07:42.600
WHAT FOR?

07:42.633 --> 07:45.500
YOU FELL FIVE STORIES
AND LIVED TO TELL ABOUT IT.

07:45.533 --> 07:49.433
I'D KIND OF WANT
TO SHOUT IT FROM THE ROOFTOPS...

07:49.467 --> 07:50.833
SO TO SPEAK.

07:50.867 --> 07:52.533
IT'S A MIRACLE.

07:52.567 --> 07:54.467
YOU MAY NOT UNDERSTAND
THE MEDICINE OF IT,

07:54.500 --> 07:56.567
BUT A 5-STORY FALL--
YOUR LUNGS SHOULD BE COLLAPSED,

07:56.600 --> 07:58.100
YOUR BACK SHOULD BE BROKEN,

07:58.133 --> 08:01.100
YOUR AORTA SHOULD BE
TOTALLY SEVERED.
GEORGE, ENOUGH.

08:01.133 --> 08:03.133
(Man) OH.

08:03.167 --> 08:05.067
OH.

08:07.533 --> 08:09.067
I'M JUST SAYING,
YOU KNOW,

08:09.067 --> 08:10.400
THERE'S A REASON FOR THIS.

08:10.433 --> 08:13.433
YOU LIVED. WE BOTH DID.

08:13.467 --> 08:15.467
CARPE DIEM, MAN.

08:15.500 --> 08:19.100
SEIZE THE DAY.

08:19.133 --> 08:21.067
ANY CHANCE
YOU COULD MAKE HIM LEAVE?

08:21.067 --> 08:24.233
I REALLY, REALLY WISH
I COULD.

08:24.267 --> 08:26.167
MR. VARGAS,
YOUR LOWER LEFT LEG BONES

08:26.200 --> 08:27.533
ARE SHATTERED.

08:27.567 --> 08:30.500
WE'LL NEED TO GET YOU
INTO SURGERY.

08:30.533 --> 08:32.733
OH, GREAT.
JUST MY LUCK.

08:32.767 --> 08:34.800
BEAK.

08:34.833 --> 08:39.233
COULD I--WOULD YOU MIND?
COULD I KEEP THAT?

08:39.267 --> 08:41.133
MY MOTHER DIED OF IT,
MY AUNT,

08:41.167 --> 08:43.333
MY COUSIN--SHE'S 37--
HAS OVARIAN CANCER.

08:43.367 --> 08:45.700
BUT YOU DON'T.
YOU DON'T HAVE CANCER.

08:45.733 --> 08:47.700
THIS IS CRAZY, SAVVY.
BUT I HAVE THE GENE, WEISS.

08:47.733 --> 08:50.067
WHICH GIVES HER UP TO AN 85%
CHANCE OF GETTING CANCER, WEISS.

08:50.067 --> 08:52.467
AND A 15% CHANCE SHE WON'T.

08:52.500 --> 08:54.400
I'M SORRY. WERE YOU INVITED?
I'M NOT BETTING MY LIFE
ON 15%.

08:54.433 --> 08:56.733
WEISS ASKED ME TO COME.
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT HELP.

08:56.767 --> 08:59.300
HELP WHAT? I'M SORRY, DEREK,
'CAUSE I LOVE YOU

08:59.333 --> 09:01.233
AND I'M REALLY GLAD
TO SEE YOU,

09:01.267 --> 09:02.233
BUT UNTIL YOU GROW A UTERUS

09:02.267 --> 09:04.067
AND WATCH YOUR MOTHER DIE
FROM THIS DISEASE,

09:04.067 --> 09:06.267
YOU DON'T GET--
YOU DON'T GET A VOTE.
DID SHE TELL YOU THEY'RE
TRYING TO GET PREGNANT?

09:06.300 --> 09:07.400
YES, SHE DID.

09:07.433 --> 09:09.200
HAVING A HYSTERECTOMY IS
GONNA THROW A WRENCH INTO THAT.

09:09.233 --> 09:12.167
DEREK, WE'VE BEEN TRYING
FOR MONTHS.
WHY GIVE UP NOW?

09:12.200 --> 09:14.100
COME ON.
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

09:14.133 --> 09:16.433
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS
TO MAKE A FAMILY, WEISS.

09:16.467 --> 09:18.100
WE CAN ADOPT. WE CAN DO--
SAVVY, I JUST---

09:18.133 --> 09:20.300
NO. NO! I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT THIS.

09:20.333 --> 09:23.300
(Derek) LET'S JUST TAKE
A STEP BACK.

09:23.333 --> 09:25.233
ALL RIGHT,
TAKE A DEEP BREATH

09:25.267 --> 09:27.167
AND THINK ABOUT THIS.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.500
I'VE ALREADY THOUGHT
ABOUT IT, DEREK.

09:29.533 --> 09:32.200
THIS...
THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

09:32.233 --> 09:33.733
DR. STEVENS,

09:33.767 --> 09:35.767
GET A COMPLETE HISTORY
AND DO HER PRE-OP LABS.

09:35.800 --> 09:37.700
GET HER SCHEDULED FOR
A DOUBLE MASTECTOMY

09:37.733 --> 09:39.733
AND CONSULT DR. CWYNAR IN
PLASTICS FOR HER RECONSTRUCTION.

09:39.767 --> 09:42.433
DEREK--
ADDISON, THIS CONVERSATION
IS NOT OVER.

09:42.467 --> 09:44.733
SHE IS MY PATIENT, DEREK.

09:44.767 --> 09:47.200
WE'RE DOING A BILATERAL
PROPHYLACTIC OOPHORECTOMY

09:47.233 --> 09:48.500
AND HYSTERECTOMY TOMORROW.

09:48.533 --> 09:50.067
GET MOVING.

09:50.100 --> 09:51.567
(Derek) PROPHYLACTIC SURGERY
IS EXTREME.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.500
(Addison) OH! THIS HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

09:53.533 --> 09:55.667
WHY WERE YOU EVEN IN THERE?

09:55.700 --> 09:57.600
SHE CAME TO ME FOR
A MEDICAL CONSULTATION, DEREK.

09:57.633 --> 10:00.567
I'M HER DOCTOR. ME.
THOSE ARE SOME OF
OUR CLOSEST FRIENDS.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.500
THIS ISN'T MEDICAL
IT IS PERSONAL.

10:02.533 --> 10:03.567
FINE. OKAY.
IF IT'S PERSONAL,

10:03.600 --> 10:05.633
THEN WE SHOULD BE DEALING
WITH THEM AS A COUPLE,

10:05.667 --> 10:07.333
ACTING LIKE A COUPLE.

10:07.367 --> 10:08.533
WHAT? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

10:08.567 --> 10:10.333
SEE THE RING?
DON'T GO TO THE RING.

10:10.367 --> 10:11.633
THE RING, DEREK, REMEMBER?

10:11.667 --> 10:14.133
WHEN WE'RE HERE AT WORK,
YOU WON'T TALK TO ME,

10:14.167 --> 10:16.200
OR ON THE FERRY WHERE YOU
PRETEND NOT TO SEE ME,

10:16.233 --> 10:17.800
OR IN COUPLES THERAPY
THREE TIMES A WEEK

10:17.833 --> 10:19.167
WHERE WE'RE ARGUING ABOUT

10:19.200 --> 10:21.733
WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD BE
IN COUPLES THERAPY--

10:21.767 --> 10:23.567
WHAT ARE WE DOING?
THIS IS NOT ABOUT US.

10:23.600 --> 10:24.800
IT IS.

10:24.833 --> 10:27.567
MEDICINE ASIDE, OUR FRIENDS
ARE GOING THROUGH HELL IN THERE,

10:27.600 --> 10:29.467
AND WE CAN'T EVEN ACT LIKE
WE LIKE EACH OTHER

10:29.500 --> 10:31.033
LONG ENOUGH TO HELP THEM.

10:33.767 --> 10:36.567
WHAT'S THAT OTHER ANIMAL
THAT'S MONOGAMOUS?

10:36.600 --> 10:38.100
I THINK IT'S VOLES.

10:38.133 --> 10:40.767
OH, I KNOW IT'S HARD.
I'M A PINCUSHION.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.033
IT'S OKAY. DON'T WORRY.

10:43.067 --> 10:45.200
I WON'T STICK
UNTIL I FIND A GOOD ONE.

10:45.233 --> 10:47.133
OTTERS MATE FOR LIFE,
YOU KNOW?

10:47.167 --> 10:48.500
EXCUSE ME?

10:48.533 --> 10:50.600
AS DO VOLES, I SUPPOSE.

10:50.633 --> 10:53.367
OKAY, I GOT IT.
HOLD STILL.

10:53.400 --> 10:56.267
IT'S GONNA TAKE A SECOND
FOR THE TUBE TO FILL.

10:56.300 --> 10:58.433
MM, I'VE ALWAYS LIKED OTTERS.

10:58.467 --> 11:01.200
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN MORE
OF A DOG PERSON MYSELF.

11:01.233 --> 11:02.433
(laughs)

11:04.367 --> 11:06.633
SHOULDN'T HE BE
MORE EXCITED?

11:06.667 --> 11:08.733
MAYBE HE'S IN SHOCK.

11:08.767 --> 11:10.833
I MEAN, HE SURVIVED.
THAT'S HUGE.

11:10.867 --> 11:13.733
HE'S GOTTA REALIZE THAT
THINGS HAPPEN FOR A REASON.

11:13.767 --> 11:15.667
OH, YEAH. MY EX-BOYFRIEND
MOVED HIS WIFE TO SEATTLE.

11:15.700 --> 11:17.200
REASON? TO TORTURE ME.

11:17.233 --> 11:18.533
I'M SERIOUS.
SO AM I.

11:18.567 --> 11:20.467
WHAT'S WITH THE HELLO KITTY
ON YOUR FOREHEAD?

11:20.500 --> 11:22.400
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

11:22.433 --> 11:24.333
GEORGE, CAN I SIGN OUT
TO YOU EARLY?

11:24.367 --> 11:26.267
YOU DON'T WANT IN
ON STU'S SURGERY?

11:26.300 --> 11:27.633
CAN'T.
I HAVE A TEST DATE.

11:27.667 --> 11:29.167
BURKE IS TESTING ME.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.100
PLUS, I'VE ALREADY SPENT
AN HOUR PICKING BIRD PARTS

11:31.133 --> 11:32.467
OUT OF THE GUY,
I'M OVER IT.

11:32.500 --> 11:33.833
CARPE DIEM.

11:33.867 --> 11:35.767
I HAVE A GIANT ZIT
ON MY FOREHEAD

11:35.800 --> 11:37.700
AND I'M BEGINNING
TO LOOK HOW I FEEL,

11:37.733 --> 11:39.300
CARPE THAT.

11:39.333 --> 11:41.133
THIS IS THE LUCKIEST DAY
IN THE WORLD.

11:41.167 --> 11:42.367
TELL THAT TO THE BIRD.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.367
THANK YOU.

11:49.400 --> 11:50.700
IS IT THE KID THING?

11:50.733 --> 11:53.800
I SAW YOUR FACE UPSTAIRS.

11:53.833 --> 11:56.233
IT'S THE KID THING
FOR MOST PEOPLE.

11:56.267 --> 11:58.600
AND THE BREASTS.

11:58.633 --> 12:02.200
OH, AND THE TOTAL MENOPAUSE,
LIKE, OVERNIGHT.

12:02.233 --> 12:04.600
IT'S A BIG STEP.
WELL, I THINK IT'S BRAVE.

12:04.633 --> 12:06.133
THANK YOU.

12:06.167 --> 12:08.100
AND, YES, I'D LOVE
TO BE PREGNANT.

12:08.133 --> 12:10.067
I WANT A LOT OF THINGS.

12:10.067 --> 12:11.800
I WANT TO SKYDIVE,
I'D LIKE TO LEARN ITALIAN.

12:11.833 --> 12:13.733
I WANT TO GO SAINT-TROPEZ
WITH MY HUSBAND

12:13.767 --> 12:15.833
AND LIE TOPLESS
ON THE BEACH.

12:15.867 --> 12:18.500
THEY DO EXCELLENT IMPLANTS
AND RECONSTRUCTIONS THESE DAYS.

12:18.533 --> 12:20.367
WON'T EVEN KNOW THE DIFFERENCE,

12:20.400 --> 12:22.433
PLUS, YOU KNOW, YOU'LL NEVER
HAVE TO WEAR A BRA AGAIN.

12:22.467 --> 12:23.767
THAT'S SOMETHING, RIGHT?

12:23.800 --> 12:26.233
ALEX...
DIDN'T I SEE YOUR SERVICE

12:26.267 --> 12:28.167
ON THE O.R. BOARD
FOR A BIOPSY RIGHT ABOUT NOW?

12:28.200 --> 12:30.200
YEAH.

12:32.600 --> 12:34.400
IT'S NOT THE KID THING.

12:34.433 --> 12:35.733
OKAY. WHAT?

12:38.100 --> 12:40.267
IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVE
A LOT OF OPTIONS.

12:40.300 --> 12:42.200
ONE, TAKE MY CHANCES
AND NEVER GET CANCER.

12:42.233 --> 12:44.333
TWO, TAKE MY CHANCES
AND DIE YOUNG.

12:44.367 --> 12:46.500
THERE'S A THIRD OPTION,
YOU KNOW?
OKAY, I'M LISTENING.

12:46.533 --> 12:48.400
TAKE YOUR CHANCES,
GET CANCER,

12:48.433 --> 12:51.167
AND FIGHT LIKE HELL
TO SURVIVE.

12:54.133 --> 12:57.200
UH... THEY'RE BOTH
REALLY NICE.

12:57.233 --> 12:58.767
I KNOW. I BOUGHT THEM.

12:58.800 --> 13:00.567
BUT WHICH ONE'S RIGHT?

13:00.600 --> 13:03.067
FOR WHAT? YOU'RE GONNA
LOOK HOT IN EITHER ONE.

13:03.067 --> 13:06.067
WELL, CLEARLY.
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

13:06.067 --> 13:07.500
WOW, YOU LOOK HOT.
(whistles)

13:07.533 --> 13:09.067
YEAH, BURKE AND I
ARE GONNA TALK

13:09.100 --> 13:10.833
ABOUT HOW HOT I AM
OVER DINNER.

13:10.867 --> 13:13.333
THIS DATE IS SUCH A MISTAKE.

13:13.367 --> 13:15.267
IT'S EASY TO GET NERVOUS
ON DATES.

13:15.300 --> 13:17.533
IT'S ESPECIALLY HARD
IF YOU'RE OUT OF PRACTICE,

13:17.567 --> 13:19.800
SO YOU JUST GOTTA BE
MELLOW, RELAXED--
I KNOW HOW TO DATE, GEORGE.
I'M NOT YOU.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.433
WELL, I HAVE HER SCHEDULED
FOR THE MASTECTOMY,

13:21.467 --> 13:25.600
AND I GET TO STAY WHILE PLASTICS
DOES A TRANSFLAP RECONSTRUCTION.
I COULDN'T DO IT.

13:25.633 --> 13:27.233
DO WHAT, MAKE YOURSELF
ALL HOT AND SEXY

13:27.267 --> 13:30.133
FOR YOUR BOYFRIEND
LIKE YANG?
GO WRESTLE SOMETHING.

13:30.167 --> 13:32.600
I COULDN'T CUT OFF
MY OVARIES AND BREASTS

13:32.633 --> 13:34.300
JUST BECAUSE I MIGHT
HAVE CANCER.

13:34.333 --> 13:36.133
THINK OF IT LIKE A HAND.

13:36.167 --> 13:38.067
IF SOMEONE TOLD YOU YOU'D DIE

13:38.100 --> 13:39.800
IF YOU DIDN'T CHOP OFF
YOUR HAND, YOU'D DO IT.

13:39.833 --> 13:42.333
EXCEPT WHEN YOU CHOP OFF A HAND,
YOU DON'T KILL YOUR SEX DRIVE,

13:42.367 --> 13:44.267
HAVE SILICONE BREASTS,
GET HOT FLASHES

13:44.300 --> 13:46.833
AND LOSE YOUR ABILITY
TO BEAR CHILDREN.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.767
IF IT WERE ME, I WOULDN'T EVEN
HAVE THE TEST.

13:48.800 --> 13:52.500
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE POINT? WE'RE
ALL GONNA DIE ANYWAY, RIGHT?

13:52.533 --> 13:55.300
IT'S THE HELLO KITTY BAND-AID
ON MY FOREHEAD.

13:55.333 --> 13:56.567
IT'S FREAKIN' ME OUT.

13:56.600 --> 13:59.600
I SAY SLICE 'EM AND DICE 'EM.
WHATEVER. THEY'RE BODY PARTS.

13:59.633 --> 14:02.400
OH, SO YOU'D CUT OFF
YOUR PENIS?
IF IT KEPT ME FROM DYING.

14:02.433 --> 14:04.300
BESIDES...
(closes locker door)

14:04.333 --> 14:06.067
I'VE GOT PLENTY TO SPARE.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.733
***

14:09.767 --> 14:11.667
I COULD DO HOT IN MY SLEEP.

14:11.700 --> 14:14.500
I LOOK HOT IN SCRUBS.
I'M A HOT PERSON.

14:14.533 --> 14:16.333
(sighs)

14:16.367 --> 14:18.233
HE'S SEEN ME NAKED
A THOUSAND TIMES.

14:18.267 --> 14:20.600
BAD, BAD IMAGES
IN MY HEAD.

14:20.633 --> 14:23.467
BUT HE'S NEVER SEEN YOU
OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.433
THANK YOU.

14:25.467 --> 14:28.700
***

14:28.733 --> 14:32.733
YOU LOOK LOVELY.

14:32.767 --> 14:35.300
THANKS.

14:38.100 --> 14:40.067
OH.

14:42.733 --> 14:45.200
VERY POLITE.

14:53.267 --> 14:56.067
OKAY, GREY, ADHESIONS ARE DOWN.

14:56.100 --> 14:58.233
WHAT NEXT?

14:58.267 --> 15:00.433
PUT IN GRASPERS
TO LIFT THE GALLBLADDER

15:00.467 --> 15:02.367
SO WE CAN DISSECT IT OUT.

15:02.400 --> 15:05.233
GOOD. AND WHAT ARE WE
LOOKING FOR IN CALOT'S TRIANGLE?

15:05.267 --> 15:07.667
THE CYSTIC ARTERY.
THAT'S RIGHT.

15:07.700 --> 15:09.600
WAIT A MINUTE.

15:09.633 --> 15:11.467
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

15:11.500 --> 15:13.533
PORCELAIN GALLBLADDER.

15:13.567 --> 15:17.800
THAT'S NOT GOOD. HMM.

15:20.267 --> 15:22.200
MR. SORRENTO,

15:22.233 --> 15:24.133
WHEN WE REMOVED
YOUR WIFE'S GALLBLADDER,

15:24.167 --> 15:26.100
WE FOUND THAT THERE WERE
CALCIFICATIONS.

15:26.133 --> 15:27.500
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

15:27.533 --> 15:30.200
IT'S OFTEN A SIGN
OF GALLBLADDER CANCER.

15:30.233 --> 15:34.267
WE SENT IT OFF TO PATHOLOGY.

15:34.300 --> 15:36.800
SHE HAS CANCER?

15:36.833 --> 15:39.067
I'M AFRAID SO.

15:39.067 --> 15:41.367
WE CAN KEEP HER COMFORTABLE,
BUT SHE'S GOING TO NEED

15:41.400 --> 15:43.467
MORE TESTS TO SEE
WHAT OUR NEXT STEPS ARE.

15:43.500 --> 15:46.100
THIS MIGHT INCLUDE
MORE SURGERY.

15:46.133 --> 15:48.700
BUT THIS--THIS SURGERY
WILL SAVE HER, RIGHT?

15:48.733 --> 15:51.267
THE CANCER
APPEARS TO BE ADVANCED.

15:51.300 --> 15:54.133
THERE ARE PALLIATIVE SURGERIES
THAT WE CAN DO.

15:54.167 --> 15:56.833
THAT IS SURGERIES
TO HELP WITH THE PAIN.

15:56.867 --> 15:59.067
BUT IT WON'T CURE IT.

16:01.733 --> 16:03.400
HOW LONG HAS SHE GOT?

16:03.433 --> 16:05.333
FROM WHAT WE CAN TELL
SO FAR,

16:05.367 --> 16:08.200
SHE HAS ABOUT
FOUR TO SIX MONTHS.

16:09.633 --> 16:11.533
I'M SO SORRY.

16:15.333 --> 16:18.367
I DON'T WANT ESME TO KNOW.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.367
WHAT?

16:20.400 --> 16:22.800
ESME--I DON'T WANT HER
TO KNOW SHE'S DYING.

16:22.833 --> 16:24.367
YOU DON'T WANT
TO TELL HER?

16:24.400 --> 16:27.067
PLEASE... YOU SAW HER.

16:27.067 --> 16:29.133
SHE'S HAPPY.

16:29.167 --> 16:30.767
LET ME TAKE HER HOME.

16:30.800 --> 16:34.500
I DON'T WANT HER TO BE AFRAID
BEFORE SHE DIES.

16:34.533 --> 16:36.767
SHE DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.700
NO, PLEASE, DON'T.

16:49.733 --> 16:51.233
NO MORE CARPE DIEM, MAN.

16:51.267 --> 16:52.833
I DON'T WANT
TO SEIZE THE DAY.

16:52.867 --> 16:54.767
SEE, THAT'S WHAT I DON'T GET.
I'M STANDING HERE,

16:54.800 --> 16:56.700
AND I'M JUST INCREDIBLY HAPPY
TO BE ALIVE.

16:56.733 --> 16:59.067
YOU KNOW, I'M LOOKIN'
AT THE SKY, IT'S BLUER.

16:59.067 --> 17:00.567
FOOD TASTES BETTER.

17:00.600 --> 17:04.067
AND I DIDN'T SURVIVE
A 5-STORY FALL.

17:13.367 --> 17:16.067
YOU JUMPED, DIDN'T YOU?

17:25.733 --> 17:27.400
ALL THE WAY DOWN,

17:27.433 --> 17:28.567
ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT
WAS DAISY.

17:28.600 --> 17:29.767
SHE'S MY EX-GIRL.

17:29.800 --> 17:32.133
SHE WORKS IN THIS HOSPITAL.

17:32.167 --> 17:35.233
PFFT. WHAT KIND OF JOKE
IS THAT?

17:38.500 --> 17:42.067
MAYBE YOU GOT A SECOND CHANCE.

17:44.167 --> 17:48.100
DAISY--YOU GOT TO GO
AND FIND HER FOR ME.

17:48.133 --> 17:50.500
YOU KNOW, TALK TO HER...

17:50.533 --> 17:53.633
TELL HER SHE'S THE REASON
I'M ALIVE.

17:57.267 --> 18:01.100
YOU KNOW, WE HAD A FUTURE.
YOU KNOW, WE HAD PLANS.

18:01.133 --> 18:02.833
WE PICKED OUT
BABY NAMES TOGETHER.

18:02.867 --> 18:05.167
SHE BETRAYED THAT...

18:05.200 --> 18:08.733
WITHOUT EVEN ASKING
MY OPINION...

18:08.767 --> 18:13.833
WITHOUT EVEN GIVING ME TIME
TO PROCESS IT.

18:13.867 --> 18:17.433
IT'S A DIFFICULT TIME,
FOR BOTH OF YOU.

18:17.467 --> 18:19.367
SHE'S EMOTIONAL.

18:19.400 --> 18:23.167
AND HORMONE CHANGES,
MOOD SWINGS...

18:23.200 --> 18:25.833
THEY SAY SHE COULD LOSE
HER SEX DRIVE.

18:25.867 --> 18:29.133
YOU'LL GET THROUGH THIS,
ALL RIGHT?

18:29.167 --> 18:31.633
YOU CAN DO THIS.

18:31.667 --> 18:34.133
YOU GUYS LOVE EACH OTHER.

18:35.533 --> 18:38.500
IS THAT WHAT YOU SAID
ABOUT YOU AND ADDIE?

18:38.533 --> 18:39.800
WHAT?

18:39.833 --> 18:41.333
YOU LEFT HER.

18:41.367 --> 18:42.700
THAT WAS DIFFERENT.

18:42.733 --> 18:44.200
WAS IT, DEREK?

18:44.233 --> 18:46.567
REALLY?

18:49.167 --> 18:51.067
YOU KNOW, I GOTTA CHECK
ON A PATIENT

18:51.100 --> 18:52.567
THEN GET READY FOR DINNER.

18:52.600 --> 18:53.533
YEAH.

18:53.567 --> 18:55.833
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

18:55.867 --> 18:57.767
SURE.

19:08.567 --> 19:11.133
WHERE'S THE BUTTER?

19:13.300 --> 19:15.733
OH, NO. THAT'S OLIVE OIL.
I WANT BUTTER.

19:18.600 --> 19:20.500
SHOULD I SEND
THE SOMMELIER OVER?

19:20.533 --> 19:22.467
AH, THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

19:22.500 --> 19:25.333
UH, WHAT IS A, UM,
NICE, OAKY CHARDONNAY?

19:25.367 --> 19:26.600
OH, I WANT BORDEAUX.

19:26.633 --> 19:29.200
THE CHARDONNAY WILL BE BETTER
WITH THE LOBSTER.

19:29.233 --> 19:31.133
I'M HAVING STEAK.

19:33.167 --> 19:35.067
YOU--YOU EAT RED MEAT?

19:35.100 --> 19:36.767
YOU DON'T?

19:44.133 --> 19:46.833
YOU'RE SERIOUSLY GOING TO
TRY TO FIND THIS GIRL,

19:46.867 --> 19:48.767
HUNT HER DOWN
WHILE SHE'S WORKING?

19:48.800 --> 19:50.267
LOOK...

19:50.300 --> 19:52.067
OKAY, I KNOW IT'S CRAZY,

19:52.067 --> 19:54.500
BUT SOMEONE'S GOTTA
TELL HER HOW HE FEELS.

19:54.533 --> 19:56.067
I MEAN, HE'S ALIVE, RIGHT?

19:56.100 --> 19:57.833
SOMETHING GOOD HAS GOT TO
COME OUT OF THIS.

19:57.867 --> 20:01.133
I MEAN,
THIS COULD CHANGE EVERYTHING.

20:01.167 --> 20:02.667
SEE, I...

20:02.700 --> 20:04.600
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
A ROMANTIC.

20:04.633 --> 20:06.633
"WAS"--PAST TENSE.

20:06.667 --> 20:08.667
(elevator bell dings)

20:08.700 --> 20:12.600
WELL, THIS IS FUN.
HELLO AGAIN.

20:12.633 --> 20:14.533
I LIKE THE HELLO KITTY,
BY THE WAY.

20:14.567 --> 20:17.100
VERY PINK, VERY CHEERFUL.

20:17.133 --> 20:19.400
(elevator doors close)

20:19.433 --> 20:21.333
DAISY WORKS IN BILLING,
WHICH IS WHERE?

20:21.367 --> 20:23.267
IN THE BASEMENT.
IN THE BASEMENT.

20:23.300 --> 20:24.233
OH.

20:24.267 --> 20:26.633
(pager beeps)

20:31.833 --> 20:33.733
YOU NEED SOMETHIN', CHIEF?

20:33.767 --> 20:36.433
I HAVE ONE MORE SURGERY,
AND THEN I'M FREE.

20:36.467 --> 20:38.633
NO, NO.
OKAY.

20:38.667 --> 20:41.533
HAVE YOU MADE
A DECISION YET?

20:41.567 --> 20:42.767
SIR?

20:42.800 --> 20:44.667
THE FELLOWSHIP.
THE SEATTLE GRACE FELLOWSHIP.

20:44.700 --> 20:46.633
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD'VE
ACCEPTED BY NOW.

20:46.667 --> 20:48.567
BUSY. I JUST HAVEN'T
HAD A CHANCE TO FILL OUT--

20:48.600 --> 20:50.500
WE'RE A PRIVATE HOSPITAL,
WE HAVE EXTENSIVE RESOURCES.

20:50.533 --> 20:51.700
YOU'LL GET MORE
SURGICAL EXPERIENCE HERE

20:51.733 --> 20:53.500
THAN ANYWHERE ELSE.

20:53.533 --> 20:55.400
YOU CAN WRITE YOUR OWN TICKET.
WHY AREN'T YOU MORE EXCITED?

20:55.433 --> 20:56.800
NO, I'M EXCITED.
I JUST...

20:56.833 --> 21:00.400
I'M SORRY. EXCUSE ME, SIR.
I JUST--I NEED TO SCRUB IN.

21:00.433 --> 21:02.467
(elevator bell dings)

21:08.267 --> 21:09.567
WHAT?

21:09.600 --> 21:12.667
OH. NOTHING.

21:16.367 --> 21:18.267
YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD
PROBABLY SKIP DESSERT.

21:18.300 --> 21:20.267
I HAVE A--
I HAVE AN EARLY MORNING.

21:20.300 --> 21:21.467
OH. RIGHT.

21:21.500 --> 21:23.300
NOT A PROBLEM.

21:30.233 --> 21:31.733
UGH!

21:31.767 --> 21:34.633
OH, MY GOD. HELP!
IS THERE A DOCTOR IN HERE?

21:36.133 --> 21:37.633
YES!
YES!

21:42.667 --> 21:44.567
CALL 9-1-1.

21:44.600 --> 21:47.467
HE SAID HE WAS HAVING HEARTBURN.
I THOUGHT HE WAS JOKING.
IS THERE A PULSE?

21:47.500 --> 21:49.300
YES, IT'S RAPID
AND UNEQUAL.

21:52.267 --> 21:53.733
LOOK AT THIS--

21:53.767 --> 21:55.767
THE LENGTH OF HIS FINGERS.

21:55.800 --> 21:58.300
OH, HE'S GOTTA BE
AT LEAST 6'4". MARFAN'S.
MARFAN'S.

21:58.333 --> 22:00.100
WHAT DO HIS FINGERS
HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

22:00.133 --> 22:02.600
YOUR HUSBAND IS SHOWING CLASSIC
MARKERS FOR MARFAN'S SYNDROME.

22:02.633 --> 22:04.133
IT MEANS THAT THE WALLS
OF HIS BLOOD VESSELS ARE WEAK.

22:04.167 --> 22:05.767
WE NEED THAT AMBULANCE.
FAST.

22:05.800 --> 22:08.767
HE COULD BE DISSECTING.
WE NEED TO GET HIM TO THE O.R.--
BEFORE HIS AORTA RUPTURES.

22:08.800 --> 22:11.367
MM-HMM.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?

22:11.400 --> 22:13.300
WE HAVE
A DISSECTING THORACIC AORTA.

22:13.333 --> 22:15.233
WE NEED A C.T. CLEARED
AND AN O.R. READY.

22:15.267 --> 22:16.433
START ANOTHER
LARGE BORE I.V.,

22:16.467 --> 22:18.133
CONTINUE HIGH-FLOW 02,

22:18.167 --> 22:20.067
TRANSPORT SIRENS
AND LIGHTS TO SEATTLE GRACE.

22:20.100 --> 22:21.267
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

22:21.300 --> 22:23.167
HEY, HE'S
THE CARDIOTHORACIC SURGEON

22:23.200 --> 22:24.633
WHO'S GONNA OPERATE ON HIM.

22:24.667 --> 22:26.700
AND SHE'S WITH ME.

22:33.433 --> 22:35.667
OH, I DIDN'T--

22:35.700 --> 22:37.233
HAVE YOU BEEN DISCHARGED?

22:37.267 --> 22:38.200
N-NO.

22:38.233 --> 22:39.567
I'M GOING OUT TO DINNER

22:39.600 --> 22:41.467
WITH MY SURGEON
AND OUR HUSBANDS.

22:41.500 --> 22:44.267
SORT OF A LAST SUPPER,
I GUESS.

22:44.300 --> 22:46.800
I KNOW, I KNOW,
NOTHING AFTER MIDNIGHT.

22:46.833 --> 22:50.533
YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED,
AREN'T YOU?

22:50.567 --> 22:52.333
HOW DO I LOOK?

22:52.367 --> 22:55.267
YOU'RE A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

22:55.300 --> 22:56.400
AND SO ARE YOU.

23:00.333 --> 23:03.067
IS THAT WHY THIS IS
SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND?

23:03.067 --> 23:05.067
OH...

23:05.100 --> 23:07.167
MENOPAUSE, I KNOW.

23:07.200 --> 23:09.733
THE BOOBS.

23:09.767 --> 23:11.667
BUT THEY HAVE
HORMONE REPLACEMENT,

23:11.700 --> 23:13.633
RECONSTRUCTIONS.

23:13.667 --> 23:16.733
BUT THE SEXY SAVVY...

23:16.767 --> 23:21.133
THE SAVVY THAT GETS NOTICED
WHEN SHE WALKS INTO THE ROOM...

23:21.167 --> 23:23.067
HMM...

23:23.100 --> 23:24.833
THE SAVVY THAT LOVES
TO WAKE HER HUSBAND UP

23:24.867 --> 23:27.300
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
TO MAKE LOVE...

23:29.100 --> 23:33.600
YEAH, I WONDER IF THAT SAVVY'S
STILL GONNA BE THERE.

23:33.633 --> 23:38.533
HONESTLY, I--
I HAVEN'T A CLUE.

23:38.567 --> 23:43.300
BUT THEN I THINK,
IS THAT WHY WEISS MARRIED ME?

23:45.367 --> 23:48.533
GOD, I HOPE NOT.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.700
COULD THIS PLACE BE
ANY FURTHER AWAY?

24:01.733 --> 24:03.367
IT'S LIKE SIBERIA
DOWN HERE.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.433
THAT'S 'CAUSE
WE DON'T LIKE SICK PEOPLE.

24:05.467 --> 24:07.200
OH.

24:07.233 --> 24:10.200
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE IN A HOSPITAL.

24:11.400 --> 24:13.167
UH, ARE YOU DAISY?

24:13.200 --> 24:15.100
I DON'T DEAL
WITH BILLING QUESTIONS

24:15.133 --> 24:16.633
AFTER 7 P.M.

24:16.667 --> 24:18.533
I'M JUST DATA ENTRY
AT NIGHT.

24:18.567 --> 24:21.567
NO, ACTUALLY, UH...
STU SENT ME.

24:23.100 --> 24:24.833
IS THIS SOME KIND OF JOKE?

24:24.867 --> 24:26.533
NO. HE'S IN THIS HOSPITAL.

24:26.567 --> 24:28.467
HE'S HAD AN ACCIDENT.
I'M HIS DOCTOR. HE'S FINE.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.200
WE'RE TAKING HIM
INTO SURGERY.

24:30.233 --> 24:34.133
UM, BUT HE WANTED ME
TO FIND YOU.

24:34.167 --> 24:36.067
WELL, YOU JUST TELL
THAT BASTARD THAT

24:36.100 --> 24:40.167
HE COULD'VE COME LOOKIN' FOR ME,
LIKE, TEN YEARS AGO.

24:56.333 --> 24:58.767
WHAT ARE YOU PISSED ABOUT?

25:00.233 --> 25:02.133
YOU LOOK AT EVERYTHING
IN A SKIRT.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.067
I'D LOOK AT YOU
IN A SKIRT--SHORT,

25:04.100 --> 25:06.400
MAYBE SOMETHING SCHOOLGIRL,
PLEATED.

25:06.433 --> 25:07.633
IF THAT SKIRT DIDN'T HAVE

25:07.667 --> 25:09.533
A PAIR OF BIG, BOUNCING BOOBS
ATTACHED TO IT,

25:09.567 --> 25:11.233
YOU'D STOP LOOKING.

25:11.267 --> 25:13.400
WHEN YOU CUT 'EM OFF,
YOU BUILD 'EM BACK UP.

25:13.433 --> 25:15.333
MAYBE YOU GET TO UPGRADE.
LIFE GOES ON.

25:15.367 --> 25:18.200
IF THERE WAS A GENETIC TEST
FOR TESTICULAR CANCER,

25:18.233 --> 25:20.433
DO YOU THINK MEN WHO TESTED
POSITIVE WOULD HAVE THE SURGERY?

25:20.467 --> 25:22.133
NO. YOU KNOW WHY?

25:22.167 --> 25:25.067
IT'S CASTRATION. WHAT MAN
WOULD WILLINGLY GET RID

25:25.067 --> 25:27.733
OF THE PART OF HIS ANATOMY
THAT MAKES HIM A MAN?

25:27.767 --> 25:29.633
THIS WOMAN
IS HAVING HERSELF CASTRATED,

25:29.667 --> 25:32.533
AND WE BOOK AN O.R.
AND ACT LIKE IT MEANS NOTHING.

25:32.567 --> 25:35.167
IT'S NOT NOTHING.

25:35.200 --> 25:38.067
GOD, HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY
ACT LIKE IT'S NO BIG DEAL?

25:38.100 --> 25:39.833
I MEAN, WHAT IF IT WAS ME?

25:39.867 --> 25:42.767
IZZIE, YOU'RE FREAKING OUT.
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

25:42.800 --> 25:44.700
IF I WAS THE ONE
WITH THE CANCER GENE,

25:44.733 --> 25:46.067
IF I SHOWED UP TOMORROW

25:46.100 --> 25:47.833
AND MY BOOBS
WERE MADE OF PLASTIC

25:47.867 --> 25:49.733
AND MY SKIN HAD AGED
TEN YEARS

25:49.767 --> 25:51.667
AND MY SEX DRIVE
HAD DRIED UP--

25:51.700 --> 25:55.400
IF IT WAS ME, ALEX, WOULD YOU BE
SO FINE WITH IT THEN?

25:55.433 --> 25:56.400
YEAH.

25:56.433 --> 25:59.200
YOU'D BE REALLY HOT
TO KISS ME WITH TONGUE THEN,

25:59.233 --> 26:00.567
WOULDN'T YOU?

26:07.200 --> 26:10.333
DR. BAILEY'S SCRUBBING IN,
SO WE'RE GONNA GET STARTED.

26:10.367 --> 26:12.167
OKAY. HEY, GEORGE.

26:12.200 --> 26:15.567
LISTEN, UH,
DID YOU FIND HER?

26:17.500 --> 26:19.533
I'M VERY SORRY, STU.

26:19.567 --> 26:22.433
THEY SAID SHE WAS
ON VACATION.

26:22.467 --> 26:25.433
OH, YEAH?

26:25.467 --> 26:27.100
MAYBE HER PARENTS.

26:27.133 --> 26:29.133
I BET YOU SHE WENT UP
TO NEW HAMPSHIRE.

26:29.167 --> 26:31.133
THAT'S WHERE SHE'S FROM.

26:31.167 --> 26:32.667
I'M GONNA PUSH
THE JOY JUICE.

26:32.700 --> 26:34.100
OOH. UP, UP AND AWAY.

26:34.133 --> 26:36.067
MAYBE YOU CAN SEE HER
AFTER YOUR SURGERY.

26:36.067 --> 26:38.400
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU RECOVER.
MAYBE THEN.

26:38.433 --> 26:41.067
IT'S ALL GOOD, MAN.
THANKS FOR TRYIN'.

26:41.067 --> 26:42.400
IT REALLY MEANT A LOT--

26:42.433 --> 26:44.600
(monitor beeping)

26:44.633 --> 26:46.500
HOLD ON, GUYS.
THERE'S A PROBLEM.

26:46.533 --> 26:49.233
HE'S CRASHING?
DR. BAILEY.

26:49.267 --> 26:52.233
O'MALLEY, START C.P.R.

26:54.167 --> 26:55.667
(Miranda) PUSH EPI.

26:55.700 --> 26:59.467
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

27:04.800 --> 27:06.700
YOU'LL NEED TO NOTIFY
THE FAMILY.
WHAT HAPPENED?

27:06.733 --> 27:08.400
THERE'LL BE AN AUTOPSY.

27:08.433 --> 27:11.300
SOMETIMES, PEOPLE GET ON
THE TABLE, AND THEY JUST DIE.

27:11.333 --> 27:13.200
THERE'S NO WAY
OF KNOWING BEFOREHAND,

27:13.233 --> 27:14.433
NO WAY OF CONTROLLING IT.

27:14.467 --> 27:16.333
BUT HE FELL FIVE STORIES
AND LIVED.

27:16.367 --> 27:17.733
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

27:17.767 --> 27:19.667
HE SURVIVED SO I COULD GO
AND FIND DAISY,

27:19.700 --> 27:21.600
AND THEN SHE DIDN'T EVEN
WANT TO SEE HIM,

27:21.633 --> 27:22.800
SO WHAT'S THE POINT?

27:22.833 --> 27:24.733
WE'RE ALL PART OF
THE COSMIC JOKE, O'MALLEY.

27:24.767 --> 27:26.433
NOW LEAVE ME ALONE.

27:26.467 --> 27:27.400
OKAY.

27:27.433 --> 27:28.600
OH, DR. BAILEY.

27:28.633 --> 27:29.567
WHAT?

27:29.600 --> 27:31.467
MR. SORRENTO
DOESN'T WANT ME

27:31.500 --> 27:33.800
TO TELL HIS WIFE
THAT SHE'S DYING.

27:33.833 --> 27:35.700
YOU HAVEN'T TOLD HER YET?
NO.

27:35.733 --> 27:37.633
OKAY, I DIDN'T HEAR YOU
SAY THAT.

27:37.667 --> 27:38.833
YOU'RE HER DOCTOR.

27:38.867 --> 27:40.767
IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
TO GIVE YOUR PATIENTS

27:40.800 --> 27:43.400
THE INFORMATION NECESSARY
TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION.

27:43.433 --> 27:44.667
NOW I'M HUNGRY,
I'M TIRED,

27:44.700 --> 27:46.633
AND YOU'RE IN MY WAY.

27:48.633 --> 27:50.400
CAN YOU SEE THE ECHO
FROM HERE?

27:50.433 --> 27:51.500
THAT DISSECTION
ISN'T SUBTLE.

27:51.533 --> 27:54.067
DID YOU SEE THAT WINGSPAN...
AND THE PECTUS CARINATUM?

27:54.067 --> 27:55.233
WHAT ABOUT HIS PALATE?

27:55.267 --> 27:58.133
THE DEFINITION
OF HIGH-ARCHED.

28:06.233 --> 28:08.667
YOU'RE BEING WOOED,
AREN'T YOU?

28:08.700 --> 28:10.067
EXCUSE ME?

28:10.067 --> 28:11.433
THE FELLOWSHIP.

28:11.467 --> 28:13.267
L.A. MED, CHICAGO CENTRAL--
THEY'RE WOOING YOU.

28:13.300 --> 28:14.467
I MEAN,
YOU'RE FIELDING OFFERS,

28:14.500 --> 28:16.167
YOU'RE LOOKING
AT BONUS PACKAGES.

28:16.200 --> 28:17.367
YOU'RE LETTING YOURSELF
BE WOOED.

28:17.400 --> 28:19.200
NO, CHIEF, I--
NO, IT'S--IT'S FINE.

28:19.233 --> 28:20.400
IT'S FINE.

28:20.433 --> 28:22.100
GO BE A HOTSHOT
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

28:22.133 --> 28:24.100
BUT TELL ME...

28:26.567 --> 28:28.567
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS
TO ME?

28:28.600 --> 28:31.733
I MEAN...
YOU KNOW, I'M HURT.

28:33.300 --> 28:34.467
REALLY HURT.

28:34.500 --> 28:36.400
AFTER ALL I'VE DONE
FOR YOU.

28:36.433 --> 28:38.333
YOU'RE GIFTED
AND YOU'RE UNGRATEFUL,

28:38.367 --> 28:41.333
AND THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

28:41.367 --> 28:45.267
I'M PREGNANT,
YOU BLIND MORON.

28:46.600 --> 28:47.700
YOU'RE WHAT?

28:47.733 --> 28:49.733
MY HEART RATE IS 110,

28:49.767 --> 28:52.533
I'M BURNING
3,000 CALORIES A DAY,

28:52.567 --> 28:53.733
MY LEGS ARE SWOLLEN,

28:53.767 --> 28:55.667
I'VE GOT INDIGESTION
AND GAS.

28:55.700 --> 28:58.567
DID YOU KNOW THAT CARRYING
A BOY IN YOUR UTERUS

28:58.600 --> 29:01.467
MEANS YOU BURN 10% MORE CALORIES
THAN IF YOU HAD A GIRL?

29:01.500 --> 29:03.600
GUESS WHAT I'M CARRYIN'.

29:03.633 --> 29:05.467
I TRY FOR SEVEN DAMN YEARS,

29:05.500 --> 29:07.400
AND A MONTH BEFORE
MY FELLOWSHIP NOTIFICATIONS,

29:07.433 --> 29:09.167
THE STICK TURNS BLUE.

29:09.200 --> 29:11.067
MEN.

29:11.100 --> 29:12.567
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING,

29:12.600 --> 29:14.733
THEY JUST SUCK THE LIFE
RIGHT OUT OF YOU.

29:14.767 --> 29:17.100
I'M NOT LEAVING.
I'M PREGNANT.

29:18.700 --> 29:20.533
UM...

29:20.567 --> 29:22.567
CONGRATULATIONS.

29:24.500 --> 29:27.233
DR. YANG...

29:27.267 --> 29:29.500
YOU'RE HANDLING
THE SAW.

29:34.133 --> 29:38.067
THANK YOU, DR. BURKE.

29:40.400 --> 29:42.533
(under breath) YOU WON'T
LET ME PICK THE WINE,

29:42.567 --> 29:44.567
BUT THIS YOU'LL LET ME DO?

29:44.600 --> 29:46.467
(laughs) ARE WE ALL SET
FOR BYPASS?

29:46.500 --> 29:48.400
ALMOST THERE.

29:48.433 --> 29:51.333
(saw whirring)

30:06.633 --> 30:11.433
SO... APPARENTLY WE BOTH
LIVE ON THIS ELEVATOR.

30:13.233 --> 30:16.700
MEREDITH...

30:16.733 --> 30:20.500
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD AT LEAST
ACKNOWLEDGE I EXIST.

30:20.533 --> 30:22.467
(bell dings)

30:28.267 --> 30:29.700
HELLO, DR. GREY.

30:29.733 --> 30:31.600
HELLO.

30:33.367 --> 30:34.533
ARE YOU READY TO GO?

30:34.567 --> 30:36.300
I WAS ON MY WAY.

30:46.800 --> 30:48.700
WELL, IT TOOK THREE HOURS,

30:48.733 --> 30:50.600
BUT THE SURGERY
WENT PERFECTLY.

30:50.633 --> 30:52.533
ALL WE HAVE TO DO NOW IS WAIT

30:52.567 --> 30:55.133
AND SEE HOW HE'S DOING
WHEN HE WAKES UP.
WHY DID THIS HAPPEN?

30:55.167 --> 30:56.367
ALMOST EVERY PATIENT
WITH MARFAN'S

30:56.400 --> 30:58.333
HAS AN AORTA THAT FAILS.

30:58.367 --> 31:00.067
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF WHEN.

31:00.067 --> 31:01.700
I GUESS IT'S LUCKY YOU TWO

31:01.733 --> 31:03.833
WERE HAVING DINNER
AT THE NEXT TABLE.

31:03.867 --> 31:05.567
IT WAS.

31:07.733 --> 31:10.067
TAKE CARE.

31:10.067 --> 31:13.733
AND WE CAN TREAT IT
WITH SURGERY AND CHEMO.

31:13.767 --> 31:15.500
BUT...

31:20.600 --> 31:24.233
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GO TO VENICE
AT THE END OF THE MONTH.

31:24.267 --> 31:26.167
DO YOU KNOW THE STORY?

31:26.200 --> 31:27.133
NO.

31:27.167 --> 31:29.567
OH, THEY SAY IF YOU RIDE
A GONDOLA

31:29.600 --> 31:30.800
UNDER THE BRIDGE OF SIGHS,

31:30.833 --> 31:33.700
YOU'RE TOGETHER
FOR ETERNITY.

31:34.800 --> 31:36.733
YOU DIDN'T TELL JED,
DID YOU?

31:36.767 --> 31:38.767
EXCUSE ME?

31:38.800 --> 31:41.467
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN SO WORRIED
THAT I'D GO FIRST.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.300
YOU DON'T WANT HIM
TO KNOW?

31:43.333 --> 31:45.067
YOU'RE YOUNG.

31:45.067 --> 31:46.800
I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND

31:46.833 --> 31:48.633
AN OLD BROAD LIKE ME.

31:48.667 --> 31:51.533
YOU CAN'T HAVE A RELATIONSHIP
BUILT ON A LIE.

31:51.567 --> 31:53.200
CAN YOU?

31:53.233 --> 31:55.133
OH, HONEY, IT'S NOT A LIE.

31:55.167 --> 31:57.667
IT'S OUR FUTURE.

31:59.567 --> 32:03.100
I'VE BEEN WITH THE LOVE
OF MY LIFE FOR 60 YEARS.

32:03.133 --> 32:05.333
AND NOW I'M DYING.

32:08.333 --> 32:12.133
WE'RE GOING TO VENICE.

32:12.167 --> 32:15.100
WE'RE GETTIN' IN THAT GONDOLA.

32:21.700 --> 32:25.400
(boat horn blows)

32:25.433 --> 32:27.333
WHEN ADDIE TOLD ME
SHE WAS COMING OUT HERE,

32:27.367 --> 32:29.567
I HAD SUCH A GOOD FEELING.

32:29.600 --> 32:31.733
YOU GUYS ARE GONNA MAKE IT.

32:31.767 --> 32:33.833
YOU WERE ALWAYS MEANT TO BE.

32:33.867 --> 32:35.767
YEAH, A COUPLE OF CLAMS
ON THE HALF SHELL.

32:35.800 --> 32:38.600
A COUPLE OF PEAS IN A POD.

32:38.633 --> 32:41.133
WE'RE STILL WORKING ON
THE POD PART.
IT'S ABOUT CHOICES.

32:41.167 --> 32:44.533
WELL, HERE'S TO TAKING LIFE
IN YOUR OWN HANDS.

32:44.567 --> 32:46.567
CHEERS. CHEERS.
CHEERS.

32:46.600 --> 32:49.633
YEAH, AND HERE'S TO BULL
AND HERE'S TO CRAP.

32:51.367 --> 32:52.833
AND HERE'S TO OOPHORECTOMY...

32:52.867 --> 32:54.200
(Savvy) OH, GOD.

32:54.233 --> 32:56.800
HYSTERECTOMY,
DOUBLE BILATERAL MASTECTOMY.

32:56.833 --> 32:58.733
PLEASE STOP.
HOW SMART AM I
TO KNOW ALL THOSE WORDS?

32:58.767 --> 32:59.767
STOP.

32:59.800 --> 33:01.800
HERE'S TO
BREAST RECONSTRUCTION,

33:01.833 --> 33:04.633
NIPPLE RECONSTRUCTION.

33:04.667 --> 33:07.567
HERE'S TO LOSING YOUR WIFE.

33:07.600 --> 33:11.167
HERE'S TO BEING THE ASS
WHO CAN'T BE SUPPORTIVE.

33:11.200 --> 33:13.333
HERE'S TO THAT.

33:14.567 --> 33:16.300
AHH.

33:27.100 --> 33:30.633
***

33:30.667 --> 33:31.833
WEISS.

33:31.867 --> 33:34.533
DON'T TALK TO ME.
KEEP WALKING.

33:34.567 --> 33:36.433
YOU SHOULD GET SOME SLEEP,
SOBER UP,

33:36.467 --> 33:38.367
SO YOU'RE READY
FOR SAVVY'S SURGERY.

33:38.400 --> 33:40.067
COME ON. I'LL DRIVE YOU.

33:40.100 --> 33:41.267
OH...

33:41.300 --> 33:44.267
I'M SUPPOSED TO HOLD HER HAND
WHILE THEY RIP HER APART?

33:44.300 --> 33:46.800
THAT'S THE DEFINITION
OF LOVE?

33:46.833 --> 33:49.067
YOU CAN DO THIS.

33:49.100 --> 33:51.500
MAYBE I CAN'T.

33:51.533 --> 33:54.533
MAYBE I'M JUST A GUY
WHO LIKES TO SCREW HIS WIFE.

33:54.567 --> 33:55.467
WEISS...

33:55.500 --> 33:57.567
THAT'S WHAT SHE'LL THINK
IF I'M NOT THERE.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.533
THEN YOU'RE GONNA BE THERE.

33:59.567 --> 34:00.633
(chuckles)

34:00.667 --> 34:02.633
THIS IS COMIN' FROM A GUY
WHO PACKED HIS BAGS

34:02.667 --> 34:04.767
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

34:04.800 --> 34:06.700
AND DROVE 3,000 MILES
TO LIVE IN A TRAILER.

34:06.733 --> 34:09.067
YEAH, WELL. WHAT AM I DOIN'
WITH ADDISON NOW?

34:09.100 --> 34:10.700
HMM?

34:10.733 --> 34:13.133
I'M TRYIN' TO WORK IT OUT.

34:13.167 --> 34:15.533
I DON'T KNOW,
AM I OUT OF MY MIND?

34:15.567 --> 34:17.733
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU TELL ME.

34:24.200 --> 34:27.500
IT'S ABOUT THE RING.

34:27.533 --> 34:29.800
IT'S ABOUT THE VOWS.

34:31.367 --> 34:34.667
SAVVY DIDN'T SCREW AROUND
WITH YOU WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND.

34:34.700 --> 34:37.433
AND SHE'S LOOKING FOR SUPPORT.

34:37.467 --> 34:40.433
IF YOU DON'T GIVE THAT
TO HER NOW,

34:40.467 --> 34:43.467
IF YOU DON'T GIVE HER
THAT SUPPORT,

34:43.500 --> 34:46.333
THEN WHAT THE HELL
AM I DOING?

34:55.800 --> 34:59.600
YOU DIDN'T TELL HER,
DID YOU?

35:00.767 --> 35:03.500
NO. I DIDN'T TELL HER.

35:29.833 --> 35:32.133
I THOUGHT HE CHEATED FATE.

35:32.167 --> 35:33.367
MAYBE HE DID CHEAT FATE.

35:33.400 --> 35:34.600
HE DIED.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.533
I THINK YOU CAN'T WAIT
FOR SOMEONE

35:36.567 --> 35:40.100
TO FLY UNDERNEATH YOU
AND SAVE YOUR LIFE.

35:40.133 --> 35:42.333
I THINK YOU HAVE TO
SAVE YOURSELF.

35:43.767 --> 35:48.400
DO YOU MEAN THE PIGEONS
AREN'T GOING TO COME?

35:48.433 --> 35:52.367
THE PIGEONS AREN'T GOING
TO COME.

35:54.233 --> 35:56.233
HOLD STILL.

35:56.267 --> 35:57.600
(both laughing)

35:57.633 --> 35:59.767
COME ON. MAKE SURE
YOU GET BOTH SIDES.

35:59.800 --> 36:01.067
OKAY.

36:01.067 --> 36:03.067
YOU KNOW THESE ARE GONNA BE
NEXT YEAR'S HOLIDAY CARDS.

36:03.067 --> 36:06.067
I WANT 'EM TO BE IMMORTALIZED
BEFORE THEY'RE GONE.

36:06.067 --> 36:09.067
AND THIS WAY WEISS GETS TO
LOOK AT 'EM WHENEVER HE WANTS.

36:11.600 --> 36:13.267
THESE ARE GONNA BE GREAT.

36:13.300 --> 36:15.200
WE'RE SCHEDULED
TO GO IN AT 8?

36:15.233 --> 36:16.067
YEAH.

36:16.067 --> 36:19.067
I'M GONNA TAKE YOU DOWN
TO THE PRE-OP

36:19.100 --> 36:22.400
IN JUST A FEW MINUTES.

36:22.433 --> 36:25.767
WEISS WILL SHOW UP, ADDIE.
HE ALWAYS DOES.

36:25.800 --> 36:28.233
SAV...

36:28.267 --> 36:31.133
AS YOUR DOCTOR, YOU KNOW
I'M 100% ON YOUR SIDE,

36:31.167 --> 36:33.333
BUT AS YOUR FRIEND,

36:33.367 --> 36:35.567
ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY SURE
ABOUT THIS?

36:35.600 --> 36:37.333
(sighs)

36:37.367 --> 36:40.267
I KNOW WHAT I'M LOSING.

36:40.300 --> 36:41.467
I GET IT.

36:41.500 --> 36:44.333
BUT THINK ABOUT
WHAT I'M GAINING--

36:44.367 --> 36:46.367
MY LIFE.

36:46.400 --> 36:48.367
THIS GIVES ME A SHOT--

36:48.400 --> 36:49.733
A SHOT AT THE FUTURE,

36:49.767 --> 36:51.600
AT SHOT AT ME AND WEISS

36:51.633 --> 36:56.633
BECOMING THIS CRAZY,
OLD WRINKLED COUPLE

36:56.667 --> 36:59.367
THAT ARGUES ALL THE TIME.

36:59.400 --> 37:02.133
I MEAN...

37:02.167 --> 37:04.367
WOULDN'T YOU WANT THAT?

37:04.400 --> 37:06.433
A CHANCE TO GROW OLD
WITH DEREK?

37:07.867 --> 37:10.733
YEAH.

37:10.767 --> 37:13.667
YEAH, I DO.

37:17.200 --> 37:18.500
OH, GOD.

37:18.533 --> 37:20.067
SAV, SAV.

37:20.067 --> 37:22.800
MAYBE ROMEO AND JULIET
WERE FATED TO BE TOGETHER,

37:22.833 --> 37:26.167
BUT JUST FOR AWHILE,

37:26.200 --> 37:28.100
AND THEN THEIR TIME PASSED.

37:28.133 --> 37:31.433
IF THEY COULD'VE
KNOWN THAT BEFOREHAND,

37:31.467 --> 37:33.800
MAYBE IT ALL
WOULD'VE BEEN OKAY.

37:33.833 --> 37:35.333
HERE'S THE THING.

37:35.367 --> 37:36.700
I LIKE YOUR RACK.

37:36.733 --> 37:38.267
GOD, WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU?

37:38.300 --> 37:41.600
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE SO--
GOD, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!

37:41.633 --> 37:43.533
I LIKE YOUR RACK,
AND I'D WANT THEM AROUND

37:43.567 --> 37:45.467
IF I COULD HAVE THEM,
TRUST ME, I WOULD.

37:45.500 --> 37:47.667
BUT IT WOULDN'T BE
THE END OF THE WORLD

37:47.700 --> 37:49.200
IF YOU GOT RID OF THEM.

37:49.233 --> 37:50.567
BECAUSE REALLY...

37:50.600 --> 37:53.133
I'D WANT YOU.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.800
OW.

37:56.833 --> 37:59.267
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

37:59.300 --> 38:02.167
I TOLD MRS. SNYDER
THAT WHEN I WAS GROWN-UP,

38:02.200 --> 38:04.100
I'D TAKE FATE
INTO MY OWN HANDS.

38:09.267 --> 38:11.467
I WOULDN'T LET SOME GUY
DRAG ME DOWN.

38:27.067 --> 38:29.400
MRS. SNYDER SAID
I'D BE LUCKY

38:29.433 --> 38:32.633
IF I EVER HAD THAT KIND
OF PASSION WITH SOMEONE,

38:32.667 --> 38:36.833
AND THAT IF I DID,
WE'D BE TOGETHER FOREVER.

38:36.867 --> 38:38.767
I GUESS WE NEVER REALLY
GOT OUR DATE.

38:38.800 --> 38:40.133
ARE YOU KIDDING?

38:40.167 --> 38:42.600
THAT WAS THE BEST DATE
I'VE EVER BEEN ON.

38:42.633 --> 38:45.533
***

38:50.433 --> 38:52.733
EVEN NOW I BELIEVE THAT,
FOR THE MOST PART,

38:52.767 --> 38:55.667
LOVE IS ABOUT CHOICES.

39:00.133 --> 39:02.267
(Derek) HEY.

39:05.400 --> 39:07.333
HE'S NOT COMING, IS HE?

39:09.833 --> 39:13.133
(Savvy) OKAY, OKAY.

39:15.600 --> 39:18.300
YOU'RE SHAKING.

39:20.667 --> 39:23.433
YOU'RE HERE.

39:25.533 --> 39:27.767
IT'S ABOUT PUTTING DOWN
THE POISON AND THE DAGGER

39:27.800 --> 39:29.633
AND MAKING YOUR OWN
HAPPY ENDING...

39:29.667 --> 39:31.767
MOST OF THE TIME...

39:34.733 --> 39:36.633
I'M GONNA GO AHEAD
AND GET STARTED NOW.

39:36.667 --> 39:39.467
YOU READY?

39:39.500 --> 39:41.667
YEAH...

39:41.700 --> 39:44.333
READY.

39:52.267 --> 39:55.600
AND THAT SOMETIMES,
DESPITE ALL YOUR BEST CHOICES

39:55.633 --> 39:57.700
AND ALL YOUR BEST INTENTIONS,

39:57.733 --> 40:00.733
FATE WINS ANYWAY.

40:12.767 --> 40:14.767
I MISS YOU.

40:35.367 --> 40:37.400
I CAN'T.
