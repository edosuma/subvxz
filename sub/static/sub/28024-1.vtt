<i>Hello? Hello, Glenn. It's Ali Davis.</i>

00:37.330 --> 00:39.082
<i>Yes, baby! I'm excited, too.</i>

00:39.165 --> 00:40.375
<i>But wait, what?</i>

00:40.458 --> 00:43.002
<i>Yes, I know</i> Sports Illustrated
<i>wants Serena for June,</i>

00:43.086 --> 00:46.256
<i>but before we talk about that client,
we need to talk about Lisa Leslie,</i>

00:46.339 --> 00:49.175
who will be front and centre at the shoot.

00:49.259 --> 00:51.803
What? Oh, oh, no.
No, this ain't a negotiation.

00:51.886 --> 00:54.606
It's centre position or tall-ass girl
ain't showing up for the shoot!

00:54.681 --> 00:56.015
<i>Big news in basketball.</i>

00:56.099 --> 00:58.810
<i>College sensation Jamal Barry
declared himself eligible</i>

00:58.893 --> 01:00.037
<i>- for the NBA draft.</i>
- What? Excuse me,

01:00.061 --> 01:01.789
- I am her agent.
<i>- He has not yet signed with an agent.</i>

01:01.813 --> 01:03.453
Oh, no, no.
Glenn, don't go there with me.

01:03.940 --> 01:06.067
What'd you say? Oh, no, no.
No, no, no.

01:06.151 --> 01:07.277
Oh, you. No. No, no, no, no.

01:07.360 --> 01:09.779
No, no, no.
Glenn, no, you listen!

01:09.863 --> 01:13.074
Unless Lisa is guaranteed
centre position in writing,

01:13.158 --> 01:14.576
you'd better learn how to Photoshop

01:14.659 --> 01:16.536
because you ain't gonna have
any of my clients

01:16.619 --> 01:19.080
in your magazine ever again!

01:19.164 --> 01:20.999
You know what? Goodbye.

01:21.082 --> 01:23.334
I'm not dealing with stupid people today.

01:23.752 --> 01:25.128
- Good morning?
- Good morning.

01:25.211 --> 01:26.421
Oh, he's calling back!

01:26.504 --> 01:28.923
You know what? Can you deal
with the slow people today?

01:29.007 --> 01:30.091
I can't.

01:30.550 --> 01:32.761
Hey, Glenn, let me see if I can get her.

01:34.512 --> 01:35.865
You know what? She just stepped out.

01:35.889 --> 01:37.724
I'll have her return. Buh-bye.

01:38.308 --> 01:40.185
How long have you been up?

01:40.268 --> 01:44.314
Ooh, since 3:00 a.m.,
and I've been crushing it all morning,

01:44.689 --> 01:46.858
talking to Nike and Puma.

01:46.941 --> 01:49.819
But I've decided I'm going
to take Candace to Adidas,

01:49.903 --> 01:51.237
because they stepped up.

01:51.321 --> 01:53.573
- You're dinging.
- Oh, no, stop it.

01:54.032 --> 01:55.867
Please stop. Here, stop it!

01:56.117 --> 01:57.452
Go away!

01:57.535 --> 02:01.539
Mari created this
Lovefinders.com profile for me.

02:01.623 --> 02:02.791
Can you please get rid of it?

02:02.874 --> 02:04.709
All these stupid alerts keep coming up.

02:04.793 --> 02:06.544
- I will have it taken down ASAP.
- Mm-hmm.

02:06.628 --> 02:08.505
If that's definitely what you want?

02:08.588 --> 02:09.923
That is definitely what I want.

02:10.006 --> 02:11.633
Okay. It's just... It's been a minute.

02:11.716 --> 02:13.134
Uh, how would you know?

02:13.218 --> 02:15.571
- Well, I keep your calendar.
- Booty calls aren't in there.

02:15.595 --> 02:17.055
Just please do what I ask you to do.

02:17.138 --> 02:18.848
Thank you. Ooh, I got to go.

02:18.932 --> 02:19.932
Dry cleaning is here,

02:19.974 --> 02:22.852
and I really feel like the black skirt,
houndstooth jacket screams,

02:22.936 --> 02:25.616
"Damn right you're making me partner!
Took you bitches long enough."

02:25.688 --> 02:28.399
You know what, Brandon?
Just because you're gay,

02:28.483 --> 02:30.985
doesn't mean you're fabulous, okurrr?

02:31.945 --> 02:34.781
- Okurr.
- It's okurrr.

02:35.156 --> 02:36.574
I... I can't even...

02:36.950 --> 02:39.619
Come on, honey, walk like you
are an assistant to a partner.

02:39.702 --> 02:42.580
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's go.

02:44.958 --> 02:46.558
Holy Mother of <i>Men's Health and Fitness,</i>

02:46.626 --> 02:47.961
what is happening here?

02:48.628 --> 02:50.839
Oh, that's my new neighbour.

02:50.922 --> 02:54.300
Captain Fucktastic, that's what
I've been calling him. Right?

02:54.801 --> 02:55.801
Yeah.

02:57.095 --> 02:59.222
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi.

03:15.446 --> 03:17.407
Such a nice day for a jog.

03:17.490 --> 03:20.952
I like running.
I just don't like running alone.

03:22.537 --> 03:23.537
He's gay.

03:25.123 --> 03:27.292
Anyone seen the new Gaga video?

03:29.210 --> 03:31.087
No, he's not.

03:36.384 --> 03:37.384
God.

03:37.719 --> 03:40.305
Not even a sideways eye fuck. Nada.

03:40.388 --> 03:41.514
What's going on in his head?

03:41.598 --> 03:43.600
What, my ass doesn't look good
in this skirt?

03:43.683 --> 03:44.893
Oh, given the current climate,

03:44.976 --> 03:47.037
it feels inappropriate
for me to comment on your body.

03:47.061 --> 03:48.414
- Brandon!
- Tight as a snare drum.

03:48.438 --> 03:49.665
You could bounce a quarter off that thing.

03:49.689 --> 03:50.773
You know what? Screw him.

03:50.857 --> 03:52.937
- Today's my day. I'm making partner, baby.
- Mm-hmm!

03:52.984 --> 03:55.445
And no man, I don't care how fucktastic,

03:55.528 --> 03:57.280
is gonna kill my vibe.

04:01.951 --> 04:03.286
<i>It's Mari,</i>

04:03.369 --> 04:04.805
<i>she says she wants you
to bring champagne</i>

04:04.829 --> 04:07.040
<i>to the bachelorette party
'cause Olivia's always sucks.</i>

04:07.123 --> 04:09.250
<i>Okay, Bridezilla, take a Xanax.</i>

04:11.502 --> 04:15.840
So, seeing as how today's
the big day and all,

04:15.924 --> 04:18.384
I was wondering if,
once you get bumped up to partner,

04:18.468 --> 04:21.596
you might...
see any changes in store for me?

04:22.972 --> 04:25.266
Look, you make a great assistant,

04:25.350 --> 04:27.685
but you'd be a shitty agent.

04:27.769 --> 04:29.187
And I say that with love.

04:30.271 --> 04:32.273
I know, right? Totally.

04:33.399 --> 04:37.028
Luckily, I'm blissfully happy
just being your assistant...

04:37.111 --> 04:38.112
Good.

04:38.196 --> 04:39.405
...in perpetuity.

04:52.835 --> 04:54.462
Ooh, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

04:55.088 --> 04:56.422
Check out the sweet new wheels.

04:56.506 --> 04:58.508
A pre-celebration for the big day, huh?

04:58.591 --> 05:02.595
No, Ethan.
Just... another day at the office.

05:02.679 --> 05:05.098
- Rolling calls, crushing balls.
- Good morning, Ms. Davis.

05:05.181 --> 05:07.141
Ah, ladies first. Thank you.

05:07.225 --> 05:08.661
I mean,
this should've happened years ago.

05:08.685 --> 05:10.405
It's crazy that I'm a partner
and you're not

05:10.478 --> 05:12.981
just 'cause I signed Matt Ryan.
I mean, come on!

05:13.064 --> 05:15.566
I mean, in fairness to me,
monster signing, but still...

05:15.650 --> 05:18.069
Yeah, you're right, Ethan. It is crazy.

05:18.152 --> 05:19.487
That's what I said.

05:19.570 --> 05:21.239
Well, I'm rooting for you.

05:21.322 --> 05:23.199
- Fingers crossed, right?
- Thanks, Ethan.

05:23.282 --> 05:24.993
I can't.

05:25.076 --> 05:27.453
Ali Davis's office. Hi, Mari.

05:28.246 --> 05:29.539
Mari says she knows you're here.

05:29.622 --> 05:31.342
She has a quick
bachelorette party question.

05:31.416 --> 05:33.042
Tell her I'm all good
for tomorrow night.

05:33.126 --> 05:35.169
Text me any specifics.
But be supportive, you know.

05:35.253 --> 05:37.422
Make it sound like I wish
I had time to shoot the shit.

05:40.008 --> 05:43.928
Hey, girl. Ali can't wait to get it.
It's gonna be a partay.

05:44.012 --> 05:47.140
Hey, hey, pop quiz!
What is being kicked today?

05:47.223 --> 05:48.766
- A world of ass!
- Boom!

05:48.850 --> 05:50.685
- Sorry.
- Staff meeting in five.

05:50.768 --> 05:52.729
I swear to God, bro, don't fuck with me!

05:53.229 --> 05:56.190
Fuck you, bro! I'll rip out
your eyes and fuck the sockets!

05:56.274 --> 05:57.650
I'll fuck your mom!

05:58.776 --> 05:59.861
Ad agency exec?

05:59.944 --> 06:01.195
Oh, no, it's my brother.

06:01.696 --> 06:04.115
Yeah, we're doing that whole
fantasy football prep.

06:04.699 --> 06:05.867
Anyway, want a doughnut?

06:07.076 --> 06:08.494
Sure. Thanks.

06:08.578 --> 06:10.663
Hey. It's always good to see you guys.

06:10.747 --> 06:11.873
It always brightens my day.

06:11.956 --> 06:13.541
Oh, thanks, Danny.

06:13.624 --> 06:16.461
You said you were gonna
fuck your brother's ma?

06:16.544 --> 06:19.255
- Our mom, yeah.
- Uh-huh. Okay.

06:19.338 --> 06:21.007
So, we're laying in bed and she says,

06:21.090 --> 06:22.675
"Do you even know my name?"

06:23.968 --> 06:26.262
- No clue, right? None.
- I have no clue.

06:26.888 --> 06:29.515
So, I pretend to be all appalled by this.

06:29.599 --> 06:31.559
I run off to the bathroom,
I sneak to the kitchen,

06:31.642 --> 06:32.977
I start looking through her mail,

06:33.061 --> 06:34.854
I find a Bed Bath & Beyond coupon.

06:34.937 --> 06:36.856
I'm buck naked, mind you.
She comes in, I go,

06:36.939 --> 06:38.941
"Oh, good morning, uh, Resident."

06:41.861 --> 06:43.821
And knowing you, Kevin,
you kept the coupon.

06:43.905 --> 06:44.906
You know I did.

06:44.989 --> 06:46.341
Story gets better, I'll finish it later.

06:46.365 --> 06:49.160
Oh, come on, Ali can handle
locker-room talk. Right, bro?

06:49.243 --> 06:52.622
Yeah, I'm sure you'll get
the X-rated version at poker night.

06:52.705 --> 06:54.749
Why do you keep on this?
There's no poker night.

06:54.832 --> 06:56.560
If there was a poker night,
we would invite you

06:56.584 --> 06:57.936
'cause I'd like to take your money.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.629
- Really?
- No poker night.

06:59.712 --> 07:01.047
None, nada, zip!

07:01.130 --> 07:04.133
Ooh, I'ma need you to calm down,
baby man child.

07:04.217 --> 07:05.468
Mm.

07:05.551 --> 07:06.803
Looking like Bamm-Bamm.

07:06.886 --> 07:09.597
Boom! Seize the day, right?

07:10.056 --> 07:11.599
That's why we're here.

07:11.682 --> 07:14.143
We seize the day here at Summit!
That's right!

07:16.270 --> 07:19.023
That's right! Good to see you!
How you doing?

07:19.107 --> 07:20.650
You keep telling yourself that.

07:21.692 --> 07:23.361
All right. Gentlemen...

07:24.779 --> 07:25.905
Headline news:

07:26.447 --> 07:29.117
Jamal Barry will be the number-one pick
in the NBA draft,

07:29.200 --> 07:30.660
and he's meeting with agents.

07:31.119 --> 07:32.453
Now, I love Jamal.

07:32.954 --> 07:35.206
Not only because he's a big-time player,

07:35.289 --> 07:36.958
but he's a franchise maker.

07:37.667 --> 07:39.252
But Jamal does come with some baggage.

07:39.877 --> 07:40.877
Dear old dad.

07:41.337 --> 07:43.756
Guy legally changed his name to Joe Dolla,

07:43.840 --> 07:46.467
which he's also calling his line
of nutritional supplements.

07:46.551 --> 07:48.469
So, now you know what we're up against.

07:48.553 --> 07:50.680
So, here's what we need.
We need to let him know

07:50.763 --> 07:53.474
that he'll have
the entire team around him.

07:53.558 --> 07:56.519
Because our teamwork
makes their dream work!

07:56.602 --> 07:58.646
- Whoo!
- That's right! All right!

07:58.980 --> 08:02.191
Now, speaking... speaking of teamwork,

08:02.275 --> 08:04.235
I think we got ourselves...

08:05.486 --> 08:07.405
a championship ball.

08:07.488 --> 08:08.406
Right?

08:08.489 --> 08:10.616
And I think you know what this means.

08:10.700 --> 08:14.453
That means somebody in this room
is about to be knighted.

08:14.537 --> 08:17.540
Now, that could be you. Uh-huh.

08:17.623 --> 08:18.708
It could be you.

08:18.791 --> 08:20.168
You had a good year.

08:20.251 --> 08:22.128
But anyway, before I name names...

08:23.254 --> 08:25.047
I got to say something about this person.

08:26.883 --> 08:27.967
This person...

08:29.177 --> 08:30.678
is tough as nails,

08:30.761 --> 08:33.514
plays with passion and grit.

08:34.640 --> 08:35.640
This person...

08:36.767 --> 08:39.187
has brass balls
when it comes to negotiations.

08:41.856 --> 08:45.193
Now, it's my honour
to confer title of partner

08:45.276 --> 08:50.031
to the person synonymous
with Summit Worldwide Management.

08:50.781 --> 08:54.285
Let's give it up for the newest
member of the partners club!

08:55.161 --> 08:56.329
Here you go! Eddie Allen!

08:58.623 --> 09:00.875
- Ali?
- Whoo!

09:02.877 --> 09:05.630
That's a great interception, Ali,
but that pass was to Eddie.

09:05.713 --> 09:07.553
- Yeah, he said "Eddie."
- Eddie, that's right.

09:08.216 --> 09:10.801
Pass that ball to Eddie. Eddie!
Eddie Allen, our new partner!

09:10.885 --> 09:12.511
Way to go, Eddie! Good job.

09:12.595 --> 09:13.638
- Great year!
- Yeah!

09:14.847 --> 09:15.973
- Eddie Allen, boys!
- Whoo!

09:16.057 --> 09:17.284
- That's our new partner!
- All right!

09:17.308 --> 09:19.435
Hand him the ball. That's right.
Give it up.

09:19.936 --> 09:22.104
You want to hand the ball to Eddie.

09:22.647 --> 09:25.107
That's right. Hand the ball over.
That's right, there you are.

09:25.191 --> 09:27.735
- Eddie Allen! Congratulations to Eddie!
- Yeah! Whoo!

09:27.818 --> 09:29.946
That's teamwork right there! Teamwork!

09:44.961 --> 09:47.463
Is this a joke, Nick? Huh?

09:47.546 --> 09:49.799
I mean, what the fuck do I have to do
to make partner?

09:49.882 --> 09:51.384
Breathe. Grab a Fiji.

09:51.467 --> 09:52.677
I mean, you know the deal.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.637
It has to be unanimous partner approval.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.889
Okay. So who was it?
It was Kevin, wasn't it?

09:57.348 --> 09:58.808
I knew it was Kevin.

09:58.891 --> 10:01.227
It's anonymous,
so I honestly couldn't tell you.

10:01.310 --> 10:04.897
This is bullshit. This is boys-club
bullshit, and you know it!

10:04.981 --> 10:07.358
Look, this is a meritocracy.

10:07.441 --> 10:09.527
So, you're not entitled to be a partner.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.737
I'm sorry, "entitled"?

10:11.821 --> 10:15.950
Oh, well, you name someone who reps
more Olympic gold medallists than me.

10:16.033 --> 10:19.161
I have clients on the cover
of <i>Sports Illustrated</i> and <i>Vogue</i>

10:19.245 --> 10:20.538
in the same month!

10:20.621 --> 10:22.641
But you don't have any of
the big three clients, do you?

10:22.665 --> 10:25.376
The MLB, the NBA, the NFL.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.837
I mean, Eddie signed Mitchell Trubisky.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.755
That's a number-one draft pick.

10:30.089 --> 10:31.841
Boom. Done.

10:31.924 --> 10:33.134
- Boom!
- Yeah.

10:33.217 --> 10:35.636
- Okay.
- Ali. Ali!

10:35.970 --> 10:37.763
Look. So I'm gonna be honest with you.

10:39.140 --> 10:40.850
You don't connect well with men.

10:42.018 --> 10:44.520
That means you're doing great
in your lane.

10:45.062 --> 10:47.773
So, let's just stay in your lane.

10:49.317 --> 10:52.278
- Okay?
- Okay. Are you finished?

10:53.237 --> 10:54.739
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Great.

10:54.822 --> 10:57.158
I have to go get back in my female lane.

10:58.367 --> 11:00.828
Have a great day, dick... I mean, Nick.

11:00.911 --> 11:01.911
What'd I say?

11:08.002 --> 11:09.503
Listen up, assholes!

11:10.546 --> 11:13.632
I am personally going to sign Jamal Barry.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.384
- Uhh.
- This is fair warning.

11:15.801 --> 11:19.180
Buckle up, backstabbing bitches.

11:29.398 --> 11:30.398
Hey, Ali, how you doing?

11:30.441 --> 11:32.360
Fan-fucking-tastic. Couldn't be better!

11:32.443 --> 11:33.736
Hey, Skip! Your daughter's here.

11:33.819 --> 11:34.819
Hey, Dad!

11:35.196 --> 11:36.364
- Hey, you're early.
- Yeah.

11:36.447 --> 11:37.447
Break.

11:39.283 --> 11:41.660
Doesn't look like you're headed
for a celebratory dinner.

11:41.744 --> 11:45.998
No, because they made
a 31-year-old suck-up partner.

11:46.457 --> 11:48.084
But I'm good, Daddy. You know why?

11:48.167 --> 11:51.629
Because I go high when they go low.

11:52.046 --> 11:54.298
- You want to talk about it?
- Yes, I want to talk!

11:54.548 --> 11:56.634
Let me just get these hand wraps...

11:56.717 --> 12:00.971
These hand wraps are... Gets me so...

12:02.139 --> 12:05.518
I work harder than all of 'em.
I do my job better.

12:05.601 --> 12:07.353
And they're still trying to hold me down.

12:07.686 --> 12:10.022
They hit you, you hit back even harder.

12:10.439 --> 12:12.358
You got you.

12:12.817 --> 12:14.819
You hear me? You got you.

12:14.902 --> 12:17.672
How am I supposed to fight a system
that's rigged against me, Daddy, huh?

12:17.696 --> 12:18.531
Tell me that!

12:18.614 --> 12:22.451
You deliver on your word.
You sign Jamal Barry.

12:22.827 --> 12:24.120
Then you're undeniable.

12:25.830 --> 12:27.581
You're right. You're right!

12:27.665 --> 12:28.999
Just shake the shit off.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.961
I got me. I got me.

12:33.087 --> 12:34.087
Come on.

12:35.131 --> 12:36.257
And soon...

12:37.341 --> 12:39.176
I'm gonna sign Jamal Barry.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.513
That's it, that's it, that's it. Yeah.

12:43.931 --> 12:46.559
Yes! Break.

12:47.393 --> 12:49.562
- Good talk, good talk.
- Thanks, Daddy.

12:49.645 --> 12:52.565
- Oh! Ho-ho-ho!
- I didn't hear the bell.

12:52.648 --> 12:55.317
That's my girl. That's my girl.

12:55.401 --> 12:56.652
I love you.

12:57.153 --> 13:01.740
I can't believe I leased
that stupid expensive Porsche.

13:01.824 --> 13:04.994
I just knew I was gonna get it this time.

13:05.911 --> 13:07.496
Fake it till you make it, girl.

13:10.332 --> 13:11.917
Who is that new bartender?

13:13.627 --> 13:15.713
Oh, that's Will.
He's been here a couple of months.

13:19.925 --> 13:22.720
Uh, you know what, Dad? I think
I'm gonna stay and have another drink.

13:22.803 --> 13:23.804
Uh-huh.

13:23.888 --> 13:25.931
- I got the bill, don't worry.
- Yeah, yeah.

13:26.015 --> 13:28.934
- Thank you for my pep talk.
- Oh, you're welcome.

13:30.269 --> 13:31.269
Muah.

13:32.480 --> 13:34.064
Don't look at me like that.

13:53.167 --> 13:54.167
Hi.

13:54.919 --> 13:55.836
Hi.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.463
So, what you mixing?

13:57.546 --> 14:00.382
How about a bespoke cocktail
tailored specifically for you?

14:00.758 --> 14:03.093
- For me?
- Let me just get a look at you.

14:04.512 --> 14:06.472
No, don't laugh. Wait a minute.

14:06.555 --> 14:08.015
All right, now turn this way.

14:08.098 --> 14:09.517
Turn the other way.

14:11.185 --> 14:13.229
Okay. I got you.

14:13.604 --> 14:14.605
Okay.

14:16.190 --> 14:18.984
Oh, oh, no, no, no,
I'm not a vodka girl.

14:19.068 --> 14:21.779
I really like whisky. I like dark.

14:22.279 --> 14:23.822
- Oh, do you?
- Mm-hmm.

14:23.906 --> 14:25.908
Would you go to a symphony,
hop up on stage

14:25.991 --> 14:28.077
and tell the conductor
he needs more cello?

14:28.160 --> 14:31.205
- Probably, but go ahead.
- Uh-huh.

14:36.252 --> 14:38.295
Okay. All right.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.091
I call this "The All You."

14:43.717 --> 14:44.802
All me.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.637
- All you.
- Mm-hmm.

14:50.516 --> 14:51.517
Mmm.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.435
Mmm.

14:53.519 --> 14:56.438
This is really good. Do I taste rose?

14:56.522 --> 14:59.608
You do. It's the cardamom rose syrup.
I make it myself.

14:59.692 --> 15:03.279
And it pairs perfectly with the CÃ®roc
you tried to get me to stop pouring.

15:07.324 --> 15:09.743
Um... Would you like to try it?

15:09.827 --> 15:12.663
I mean, if you don't mind
sharing my straw.

15:17.918 --> 15:18.918
Uh...

15:35.603 --> 15:37.730
Yeah.

15:38.522 --> 15:41.066
Where'd you say your bedroom was? Huh?

15:41.150 --> 15:42.735
Oh! Over there?

15:42.818 --> 15:45.404
It's, uh... somewhere back there.

15:45.863 --> 15:47.114
Go find it.

15:47.197 --> 15:49.617
Ooh, girl, what I'm about to do to you!

15:49.700 --> 15:51.493
Yeah, show me, papi!

15:51.577 --> 15:52.870
Oh, yeah.

15:54.288 --> 15:56.040
- To the left.
- Wait.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.958
To the left. To the right, to the right!

15:58.042 --> 16:00.252
- Wait, hold...
- To the left!

16:00.336 --> 16:01.587
Ah! Can we talk about...

16:01.670 --> 16:04.423
- Oh!
- Ow! Ah, ah!

16:04.506 --> 16:06.842
Hold on! Ah...

16:07.343 --> 16:08.761
Uh!

16:09.762 --> 16:11.555
Uh... Okay.

16:12.181 --> 16:13.641
- Uh...
- Ooh.

16:18.479 --> 16:19.563
Oh!

16:19.647 --> 16:21.357
Oh, that's it! Oh, my God!

16:21.440 --> 16:23.692
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

16:23.776 --> 16:25.319
I can't breathe! I can't breathe!

16:27.863 --> 16:30.324
Whoa! Ah! Ah!

16:30.407 --> 16:33.661
Ooh! Ooh, ooh.

16:33.744 --> 16:35.329
That was great.

16:42.044 --> 16:43.128
Yeah.

17:09.530 --> 17:11.281
- Who are you?
- I'm Ben.

17:11.615 --> 17:13.575
I hope it's okay I borrowed your mask.

17:14.617 --> 17:16.912
Welcome to Wakanda.

17:19.915 --> 17:20.833
What?

17:20.915 --> 17:21.915
Hey, Ben.

17:22.376 --> 17:24.294
Ben. Ben! Oh, uh.

17:24.670 --> 17:25.753
Hey. Hey, buddy.

17:25.838 --> 17:27.648
I thought Brody's dad
was dropping you off at 10:00.

17:27.673 --> 17:29.174
It's 10:05.

17:29.258 --> 17:31.343
- 10:05...
- Oh, okay, uh...

17:31.427 --> 17:33.595
Go... Go play with some Legos.
Daddy's getting up.

17:33.679 --> 17:34.698
- Now go, go play.
- I... I need...

17:34.722 --> 17:37.391
- I need my, uh, my mask.
- The nasty... Oh.

17:37.474 --> 17:40.519
Don't... Close your mouth.
Don't breathe. Don't say nothing. Just...

17:40.853 --> 17:42.688
- Can I... Just...
- That mask...

17:42.771 --> 17:45.149
- The little...
- Thank you!

17:45.441 --> 17:47.276
Come on, baby, go. Just play Legos.

17:47.359 --> 17:50.696
Go play some Legos.
I'ma be there. Daddy's coming.

17:50.779 --> 17:51.939
- All right.
- You have a kid?

17:51.989 --> 17:53.031
He was at a sleepover.

17:53.115 --> 17:54.992
Obviously, I did not want him to see this.

17:55.075 --> 17:57.035
Oh, my God. This is terrible.

17:57.411 --> 17:59.413
- Baby, where are you going?
- I'm never late.

18:00.038 --> 18:03.333
I'm so late!
I'm so late, so late, so late.

18:06.253 --> 18:08.589
You're married?

18:08.672 --> 18:09.506
Wait. No...

18:09.590 --> 18:12.384
Okay, what time does
she get here, huh? 10:18?

18:13.010 --> 18:15.137
- Jerk!
- It's not what you think...

18:16.722 --> 18:18.515
I knew that wasn't a mask.

18:21.685 --> 18:24.980
45K. I know it's a starter model
for me, but I'm in the game now.

18:26.565 --> 18:28.192
Ali, hey, hey! Good of you to join us.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.319
- Hey!
- You know Devonta and John, right?

18:30.402 --> 18:31.820
- Devonta, of course!
- Yeah.

18:31.904 --> 18:34.490
- I love your hair like that.
- Your hair...

18:34.573 --> 18:35.949
Thank you! Hey, John.

18:36.033 --> 18:37.713
I can't see your hair
all the way up there.

18:37.743 --> 18:38.786
Good to see you, though.

18:38.869 --> 18:41.222
- Hey, you got a little some...
- Hey, no, you got something!

18:41.246 --> 18:42.498
Don't you try that, cutie.

18:43.081 --> 18:44.309
- Thank God, you're here.
- Yes.

18:44.333 --> 18:45.834
We have a centre-position situation.

18:45.918 --> 18:48.003
No, we don't have a situation,
we have a contract.

18:48.086 --> 18:49.838
- That's the situation.
- Okay.

18:49.922 --> 18:52.402
Uh, not asking, just informing:
you have a condom on your back.

18:52.466 --> 18:54.110
- A what?
- You have a condom on your back.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.053
A what? Oh, my God.
Get it off. Get it off!

18:56.136 --> 18:57.136
Get it off!

18:57.429 --> 18:59.491
Please remember this when
you're considering my raise.

18:59.515 --> 19:01.517
Yeah, take it to your grave
or I will kill you.

19:03.227 --> 19:05.062
What is this centre-position bullshit?

19:05.145 --> 19:07.981
Which asshole in here doesn't understand
the concept of a contract?

19:08.065 --> 19:10.275
- Hold...
- Kevin! Do not talk over me.

19:11.527 --> 19:13.028
Tell whichever asshole here

19:13.111 --> 19:15.531
who wants to try to bump Lisa
from centre position

19:15.614 --> 19:17.032
- to step to me...
- Okay.

19:17.115 --> 19:18.755
...and not hide behind you motherfuckers.

19:18.826 --> 19:19.826
Great.

19:19.868 --> 19:21.745
Tell him yourself
'cause he's right behind you.

19:21.829 --> 19:22.663
Where?

19:22.746 --> 19:24.164
Peek-a-boo.

19:24.581 --> 19:26.375
Business rule number one:

19:26.458 --> 19:28.919
You should never call somebody
an asshole behind they back.

19:29.002 --> 19:30.754
- You know who said that?
- No, I do not.

19:30.838 --> 19:32.840
- Asparagus Chevrolet.
- Who?

19:32.923 --> 19:36.051
You know,
a co-founder of General Motors, 1884.

19:36.510 --> 19:37.761
Ali Davis...

19:38.428 --> 19:40.472
meet Joe Dolla, Jamal Barry's father.

19:41.849 --> 19:43.350
And manager.

19:43.433 --> 19:44.685
And bodyguard.

19:45.060 --> 19:47.563
And psychologist and nutritionist

19:47.646 --> 19:50.482
and trainer and sociologist and urologist.

19:50.566 --> 19:52.234
That means everything.

19:52.317 --> 19:54.319
- Wow, that's a lot. Uh...
- Mm-hmm.

19:55.112 --> 19:56.697
You know the second rule of business?

19:57.155 --> 19:58.949
There's always a win-win situation

19:59.032 --> 20:01.660
where everyone walks away happy.
You like that?

20:01.743 --> 20:03.161
I know that's right.

20:03.245 --> 20:05.914
But it don't always happen
like that in sports. It don't.

20:05.998 --> 20:07.165
Somebody got to win,

20:07.249 --> 20:09.543
and somebody got to taste
the agony of defeat,

20:09.626 --> 20:11.211
like that blind ski jumper.

20:11.295 --> 20:12.963
Yeah. It's a lethal day.

20:13.589 --> 20:15.269
Decapitated.
Just help us out here, please?

20:15.340 --> 20:17.509
- Ali D!
- Lisa!

20:17.843 --> 20:21.555
Hey, girl, look at you!
Six feet five inches of perfect.

20:21.638 --> 20:22.806
What's the holdup here?

20:23.223 --> 20:26.018
Yeah, I was gonna come over
and talk to you about that.

20:26.351 --> 20:30.314
We were talking about the cover image,
and...

20:30.397 --> 20:32.399
of course,
you're guaranteed centre position.

20:33.025 --> 20:37.487
But we were... we were thinking that
maybe you'd split it

20:38.280 --> 20:40.032
with, um, Jamal Barry,

20:40.115 --> 20:42.159
the projected number-one NBA draft pick?

20:43.785 --> 20:45.746
- Split it?
- Mm-hmm.

20:46.455 --> 20:48.707
Let me ask you guys a question.
Are you good at math?

20:48.790 --> 20:50.550
- Yes, <i>summa cum laude.</i>
- Not my strong suit.

20:50.584 --> 20:51.877
I got through.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.171
So how many championships
does Jamal Barry have?

20:54.630 --> 20:58.216
None. But this is
the "Legends and Rising Stars" issue.

20:58.300 --> 21:02.137
I have two championships,
three MVPs, and four gold medals.

21:02.220 --> 21:05.349
Now add that up and tell me
if I'm gonna share my magazine cover

21:05.432 --> 21:08.143
with whatever dude is here
or the flavour of the month.

21:08.226 --> 21:09.603
Uh...

21:11.480 --> 21:14.024
Okay. You're right. You are right.

21:14.107 --> 21:16.276
Give the woman the throne, gents!

21:16.360 --> 21:19.112
She's earned it. And we have a contract.

21:19.863 --> 21:22.783
Boom! I'm so glad my agents
are mad geniuses.

21:23.158 --> 21:25.011
And Ali, you got an old wine stain
on your blouse.

21:25.035 --> 21:27.537
Girl, yes, wine next week!
Your house.

21:28.163 --> 21:30.248
- So, you mentioned win-win.
- Yes.

21:30.332 --> 21:32.000
And I ate all those shrimps over there.

21:32.084 --> 21:33.627
You understand? So, I win.

21:33.710 --> 21:36.880
My son Jamal is not gonna be
a part of this photo shoot.

21:37.339 --> 21:39.716
You lose. Now watch this.

21:39.800 --> 21:40.926
Jamal, let's go!

21:44.262 --> 21:46.098
Jamal, it was...

21:46.598 --> 21:47.598
very nice to...

21:49.267 --> 21:51.561
- Well, that could've gone worse.
- How?

21:51.645 --> 21:53.814
Could've noticed the used condom
on your back earlier.

21:54.940 --> 21:57.734
That was a rubber glove.
I was dyeing my hair, you asshole.

21:58.235 --> 22:00.445
Yeah... dyeing your hair with semen.

22:02.155 --> 22:03.657
<i>So, the wine gal at Rite Aid</i>

22:03.740 --> 22:06.326
<i>said this was their bestseller
for bachelorette parties.</i>

22:06.410 --> 22:09.287
Well, your taste in champagne
hasn't evolved much since college,

22:09.371 --> 22:10.622
but down the hatch.

22:10.706 --> 22:12.582
Kinda Chablis
meets NyQuil and bleach.

22:12.666 --> 22:14.543
- Oh, it's burnt.
- Hello, everyone!

22:14.626 --> 22:16.128
- Hey, girl.
- Sorry I'm late.

22:16.211 --> 22:17.254
Ah.

22:17.337 --> 22:18.630
Look at you and your boobies.

22:18.714 --> 22:21.133
- I picked up some champagne.
- Thank God, real champagne!

22:21.216 --> 22:22.801
Good. Because mine sucked.

22:22.884 --> 22:25.178
Happy last days of
being a single woman, cousin.

22:25.262 --> 22:26.346
Lots of dicks here.

22:26.430 --> 22:28.140
Okay, you need to put that down.

22:28.223 --> 22:29.516
Oh.

22:29.975 --> 22:30.809
- What'd I miss?
- Uh-oh.

22:30.892 --> 22:32.644
- Oh, I know that face.
- Ali...

22:33.228 --> 22:34.228
- Yeah.
- Oh.

22:34.271 --> 22:35.939
You didn't make partner, did you?

22:36.023 --> 22:38.400
Did that little shit Brandon text you?

22:38.483 --> 22:42.779
Uh, no, your half-ass angry smile
kinda gave it all away.

22:42.863 --> 22:44.823
I just can't believe that Nick

22:44.906 --> 22:47.492
tried to sell me some bullshit about how...

22:48.243 --> 22:50.245
how I don't connect with men.

22:50.829 --> 22:51.955
Can you believe that?

22:52.247 --> 22:53.081
Mm.

22:53.165 --> 22:54.166
Me!

22:54.249 --> 22:55.584
- I mean, it...
- Uh...

22:56.418 --> 22:57.961
- What?
- Uh, let me see that bottle.

22:58.045 --> 22:59.755
- Nothing!
- Nothing, I...

23:00.464 --> 23:02.299
Mm. Mm-mm-mm.

23:02.549 --> 23:04.760
Well... I don't get it.

23:04.843 --> 23:07.888
Right? I grew up around men all my life.

23:07.971 --> 23:09.848
- Like, fuck him!
- Mm, Ali...

23:09.931 --> 23:11.266
I think I'm gonna call a Lyft.

23:11.349 --> 23:15.812
No. No.
No one's calling anything, because...

23:16.688 --> 23:19.066
- we should be smoking up.
- Ciarra!

23:19.149 --> 23:21.526
I haven't smoked that in 25 years.

23:21.610 --> 23:24.780
I'm high on Christ.
I don't need it anymore.

23:25.280 --> 23:27.574
Okay, so...

23:27.657 --> 23:30.911
I have a special surprise for you ladies.

23:30.994 --> 23:32.662
- Oh.
- I love surprises.

23:32.746 --> 23:38.627
Now, we all know that Mari and James
have a bright and shiny future. Okay?

23:38.710 --> 23:40.629
But specifics are good, right?

23:40.712 --> 23:43.131
So I hired a psychic. Come on.

23:43.215 --> 23:45.634
- Come on! Yes!
- That's really sweet, Olivia.

23:45.717 --> 23:50.680
But don't nobody want no Dionne Warwick
psychic-hotline con artist

23:50.764 --> 23:52.182
spinning bullshit about our past.

23:52.265 --> 23:55.435
Okay, well, she's already here,
and she probably can hear you, so...

23:56.812 --> 23:57.812
Ah.

24:18.333 --> 24:19.417
Where did you find her?

24:19.501 --> 24:21.837
- Facebook.
- What?

24:22.379 --> 24:24.756
All right, ladies...

24:25.757 --> 24:32.013
our spiritual journey tonight
will begin with...

24:34.474 --> 24:37.686
Oh!

24:39.146 --> 24:40.790
<i>♪ Old school players to new school fools ♪</i>

24:40.814 --> 24:42.190
<i>♪ Kast keep it jumpin"... ♪</i>

24:43.275 --> 24:44.526
<i>♪ Nigga be tryin' to... ♪</i>

24:44.609 --> 24:45.819
<i>♪ Ain't your mama pretty ♪</i>

24:45.902 --> 24:47.404
<i>♪ Got meatballs in her titty ♪</i>

24:47.487 --> 24:48.905
Bee-otch!

25:00.417 --> 25:01.417
You.

25:03.211 --> 25:04.211
My card.

25:05.297 --> 25:06.297
Um...

25:08.717 --> 25:10.218
Please tap these cards.

25:15.932 --> 25:16.932
Thank you.

25:22.105 --> 25:23.105
Hmm.

25:27.110 --> 25:28.111
Hmm!

25:29.905 --> 25:30.905
Mm.

25:32.240 --> 25:34.618
Mmm. Mmm!

25:35.744 --> 25:39.206
Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!

25:39.623 --> 25:40.624
Mmm!

25:41.458 --> 25:42.458
Mmm!

25:42.834 --> 25:45.170
Uh! Uh!

25:51.176 --> 25:53.053
It says here you're
having problems at work.

25:53.637 --> 25:57.098
Yeah, you heard me
talking to my girlfriends.

25:57.182 --> 25:59.351
Mm-hmm. Mm, mm. Mm!

26:00.185 --> 26:04.439
There's a man there
who does not want you to succeed.

26:04.731 --> 26:06.483
Uh, he feels threatened by you.

26:06.566 --> 26:08.818
Ah. A man? Trya dozen.

26:08.902 --> 26:12.280
There's also a man who you
will have a relationship with.

26:14.324 --> 26:16.451
And his name begins with...

26:18.578 --> 26:19.578
W.

26:22.707 --> 26:23.875
- Will?
- Wait, ho...

26:23.959 --> 26:26.795
How did you know that?
How the fuck did you know that?

26:28.463 --> 26:31.049
Were you spying on me
at the Highland Tap last night?

26:31.132 --> 26:32.425
Ma'am, I don't know who you are.

26:32.509 --> 26:34.886
Plus, I'm 19 years sober.

26:35.220 --> 26:38.306
If you don't count the weed
and the peyote and the crack.

26:38.390 --> 26:39.516
Crack?

26:41.101 --> 26:43.687
I was just kidding.

26:44.312 --> 26:45.772
Fuck the goddamn shit.

26:47.023 --> 26:49.442
You want to know
how to connect with men, right?

26:50.193 --> 26:51.736
- Uh...
- Well, I can help you

26:51.820 --> 26:53.863
open your inner portal.

26:54.990 --> 26:55.990
Yeah.

26:56.199 --> 26:58.952
So, let's just... have some tea.

26:59.035 --> 27:02.038
- Oh, I don't really like tea.
- No, no, have some.

27:02.122 --> 27:04.082
Oh, what's that smell?

27:04.165 --> 27:06.876
Oh, that's the fey lougawou plant.

27:06.960 --> 27:08.920
It's an extract from Haiti.

27:09.004 --> 27:10.255
Then I can read you.

27:16.928 --> 27:17.928
Just take a sip.

27:18.930 --> 27:21.891
Go on, take a sip. Relax.

27:21.975 --> 27:22.975
- Ew.
- Oh.

27:25.520 --> 27:26.604
Whoa, yes!

27:28.148 --> 27:30.108
Now...

27:30.191 --> 27:31.609
Oh, yeah, drink it.

27:32.444 --> 27:34.237
- Get it down. Sip it.
- Uh...

27:34.988 --> 27:38.992
Oh. Travel within. Feel yourself.

27:39.075 --> 27:41.911
Feel it. Relax.

27:42.579 --> 27:43.747
You are yin...

27:44.414 --> 27:45.999
and you are yang.

27:48.626 --> 27:51.629
You are both male and female.

27:53.882 --> 27:56.343
Ali. Oh, feel it all inside.

27:57.469 --> 27:59.262
Let it work your insides.

28:00.555 --> 28:01.806
<i>You are yin...</i>

28:02.307 --> 28:03.391
Do you feel it?

28:03.475 --> 28:05.435
<i>...and you are yang.</i>

28:06.311 --> 28:07.896
<i>Journey within.</i>

28:07.979 --> 28:11.816
<i>Hear your inner, inner, inner voice.</i>

28:11.900 --> 28:12.900
Ali.

28:14.152 --> 28:16.363
I'm ready to shake a tail feather!

28:17.906 --> 28:20.367
- We didn't get enough of that bong.
- Hey, Lyft driver!

28:20.825 --> 28:23.745
- Are you ready for the girls?
- Whoo!

28:23.828 --> 28:26.581
- The party bus has arrived!
- Yes!

28:26.664 --> 28:28.416
Bitch said my fashion was terrible.

28:28.500 --> 28:31.211
Oh, that was so much fun.
It was such a great reading.

28:59.614 --> 29:01.991
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
take it easy, girl.

29:02.075 --> 29:05.286
I don't want to spend my special night
holding your hair out of the toilet.

29:05.370 --> 29:07.497
- No, girl, I'm good.
- Okay.

29:08.456 --> 29:10.583
I don't know if it's that freaky tea

29:10.667 --> 29:13.378
or if it's all the weed and the Hennessy,

29:13.461 --> 29:16.089
but honey, I am feeling it!

29:16.506 --> 29:18.716
Is anybody else feeling...

29:31.604 --> 29:34.858
That's my song!

29:34.941 --> 29:37.360
Uh, actually, it's my song.

29:37.444 --> 29:39.070
- Oh!
- You... You remember?

29:39.154 --> 29:40.780
Before I started following the Lord,

29:40.864 --> 29:43.700
I was following 2 Live Crew on tour.

29:43.783 --> 29:46.411
- It's true, it's so true.
- Oh, my God!

29:46.494 --> 29:49.581
Little secret here...
this song is about me.

29:55.003 --> 29:56.003
All right.

29:59.174 --> 30:01.926
Okay, I gotta go. I gotta go. Move.

30:14.731 --> 30:16.524
- Ooh!
- Whoo!

30:31.623 --> 30:33.791
Oh, someone had too much whisky tonight.

30:41.758 --> 30:42.758
Whoo!

30:45.345 --> 30:46.345
Whoo!

30:54.354 --> 30:55.230
Whoo!

30:55.313 --> 30:56.689
Ah! Ah!

31:06.991 --> 31:09.327
Oh. Morning, Ms. Davis.

31:09.410 --> 31:11.412
All your signs look good,

31:11.496 --> 31:15.416
but I'm gonna check your vitals once more
before we release you back in the wild.

31:16.834 --> 31:18.753
<i>Thank God
this one didn't die on me.</i>

31:18.836 --> 31:21.714
<i>Some dickweed shoves
a whole hairdryer into his rectum,</i>

31:21.798 --> 31:23.550
<i>electrocutes himself in the shower,</i>

31:23.633 --> 31:25.301
<i>but somehow I'm responsible.</i>

31:25.385 --> 31:26.594
<i>I mean, who does that?</i>

31:26.886 --> 31:28.471
Um, excuse me.

31:28.555 --> 31:30.056
- Hmm?
- Doc.

31:30.139 --> 31:32.350
- Did you say something?
- No.

31:33.184 --> 31:38.565
You did. You said something about
some dude shoving a hairdryer up his ass.

31:39.899 --> 31:42.026
- I don't think I did.
- No, I heard you.

31:42.277 --> 31:43.486
And that's... that's weird.

31:43.570 --> 31:45.780
That's something very weird to say.

31:46.864 --> 31:48.825
Oh, well, anyway, uh...

31:48.908 --> 31:51.119
Blood pressure's normal. All good.

31:52.203 --> 31:53.329
<i>I must be losing it.</i>

31:53.413 --> 31:55.456
<i>Starting today, no more drinking at work.</i>

31:55.832 --> 31:57.292
<i>- Just cocaine.</i>
- Hey!

31:57.917 --> 32:00.044
Why are you telling me
about your coke problem?

32:00.128 --> 32:03.006
A, it makes me very uncomfortable.
You're a doctor.

32:03.089 --> 32:05.216
And B, just too much information.

32:06.926 --> 32:08.886
- I didn't say anything.
- You did.

32:09.387 --> 32:11.431
- Are you taping this?
- What?

32:11.514 --> 32:12.765
I'm calling a lawyer.

32:13.850 --> 32:15.268
You need rehab.

32:16.269 --> 32:17.562
Where's my cell phone?

32:17.645 --> 32:19.647
Oh, you're okay. Hallelujah.

32:19.731 --> 32:22.358
Praise the Lord.
I've been praying and fasting all night.

32:22.442 --> 32:24.694
- I'm starving! Muah, muah.
- Oh, you are so dramatic.

32:24.777 --> 32:25.903
And my knees are killing me.

32:25.987 --> 32:28.239
Hey, girl, I got some Combos.
Raided the vending machine!

32:28.323 --> 32:31.451
<i>This place smells like gonorrhoea. Ugh!</i>

32:31.534 --> 32:32.994
- What did you say?
- Hmm?

32:33.077 --> 32:35.872
- Ms. Davis, you're free to go.
- Oh, finally!

32:35.955 --> 32:37.957
I can take you home
or I brought work clothes.

32:38.041 --> 32:39.041
Work.

32:39.417 --> 32:42.420
- Ali, can't you take it easy for a change?
- No, no, no. Don't do that.

32:42.503 --> 32:44.505
You know what,
close that so I can get dressed.

32:46.591 --> 32:48.176
- Hey, queen.
- Hi, how are you?

32:48.259 --> 32:51.012
I'm good. So... here's the T.

32:51.095 --> 32:53.848
We had a bachelorette party last night,
and we're a little hung over.

32:53.931 --> 32:57.352
So if you could just
hook us up with some... Oxy?

32:57.435 --> 32:59.062
No, ma'am, I'm sorry. I can't do that.

32:59.145 --> 33:00.396
Darvocet?

33:00.938 --> 33:01.938
Percocet?

33:02.815 --> 33:03.983
Any 'cets?

33:04.817 --> 33:07.695
All the 'cets? Oh, you nasty!
All the 'cets?

33:07.779 --> 33:09.364
No, ma'am, we can't do that. Sorry.

33:09.447 --> 33:12.617
Okay, this is gonna change your mind.

33:13.326 --> 33:14.202
Gonna blow your mind.

33:14.285 --> 33:15.429
- No, I'm sorry.
- Meet me on eight.

33:15.453 --> 33:17.497
Girl, I can't do transactions
in public like this.

33:17.580 --> 33:18.915
On eight, in the closet.

33:19.916 --> 33:23.044
<i>Oh, my doctor says
I can't drive for a week.</i>

33:23.336 --> 33:26.589
Which should give me enough time
to find my driver's licence.

33:27.465 --> 33:30.343
Which could be anywhere, after last night.

33:30.426 --> 33:33.638
<i>Well, at least I don't have to
peel used condoms off your back today.</i>

33:33.721 --> 33:34.722
<i>So far.</i>

33:36.391 --> 33:38.559
Okay, stop doing that.

33:38.643 --> 33:39.686
Stop doing what?

33:39.769 --> 33:41.771
Talking without moving your mouth

33:41.854 --> 33:45.024
and saying rude shit
you should not be saying to your boss.

33:45.108 --> 33:46.234
I swear on my life

33:46.317 --> 33:49.529
I would never say anything disrespectful
or inappropriate to you ever.

33:49.779 --> 33:51.489
<i>Which is more than I can say for you.</i>

33:51.906 --> 33:53.491
Right there. You just did it.

33:53.574 --> 33:55.174
You said, "More than I can say for you."

33:55.243 --> 33:57.537
And then there was that crack
about the condom on my back.

33:57.620 --> 34:00.123
- I heard you say it!
- But I... I didn't say it.

34:00.206 --> 34:01.624
<i>Holy shit, are you reading my mind?</i>

34:01.708 --> 34:04.502
<i>Because if you can hear
my inner thoughts, I am super fucked!</i>

34:04.585 --> 34:07.380
I can hear your inner thoughts,
and you are super fucked!

34:10.132 --> 34:11.342
Stop screaming!

34:11.842 --> 34:13.511
I said stop doing that!

34:13.594 --> 34:15.221
- Okay, Brandon, pull over.
- Okay.

34:15.304 --> 34:17.074
- Pull over, I need some air.
- I'm pulling over.

34:17.098 --> 34:18.618
I need some air. Pull over right here!

34:18.683 --> 34:19.600
I'm pulling over!

34:19.684 --> 34:22.937
- Stop the fucking car!
- I'm stopping the car!

34:23.020 --> 34:24.188
I stopped thinking! I swear!

34:24.272 --> 34:26.166
- I'm not screaming inside my head! Hello?
- No, no, no, no.

34:26.190 --> 34:27.989
Wait, what are you doing?
You don't do stairs!

34:28.025 --> 34:29.444
What are you doing?

34:32.112 --> 34:33.489
Okay, okay.

34:35.324 --> 34:36.451
Fresh air.

34:39.996 --> 34:42.998
<i>Goddamn dog.
I wish I could shit anywhere.</i>

34:43.081 --> 34:44.292
<i>That would be cool.</i>

34:45.208 --> 34:47.128
<i>These shoes
are fucking killing me.</i>

34:47.210 --> 34:49.011
<i>What was the name of that cheese
that I liked?</i>

34:49.088 --> 34:50.505
<i>Michael Keaton
was the best Batman.</i>

34:50.590 --> 34:53.217
<i>Yes, bitch,
I look good in this hat. I know.</i>

34:54.092 --> 34:55.719
<i>That's water on my pants, not pee.</i>

34:55.803 --> 34:57.322
- <i>Is it "croyssant" or "croissant"?</i>
- Oh!

34:57.346 --> 34:59.366
<i>Nothing wrong with being a virgin,
no matter what my mom says.</i>

34:59.390 --> 35:01.452
<i>- French people are so cool.
- Did I let the dog out?</i>

35:01.476 --> 35:04.061
<i>I wish I'd fucked a black broad
before I got married.</i>

35:04.645 --> 35:06.689
<i>Hello, Oprah!</i>

35:08.691 --> 35:10.818
No! No! No! No!

35:14.655 --> 35:16.824
<i>Would you stop running?
It's cobblestone!</i>

35:16.908 --> 35:18.201
Shut up, just shut up!

35:18.284 --> 35:20.119
- Good morning, Ms. Davis.
- Good morning.

35:20.203 --> 35:23.372
<i>This whole wearing
ladies' underwear thing is fantastic.</i>

35:23.456 --> 35:24.624
<i>Who knew?</i>

35:26.042 --> 35:28.252
Ali, can you hear other people?

35:28.336 --> 35:31.756
Key to signing Matt Ryan: befriending
his wife through mutual friends at BC.

35:32.381 --> 35:34.884
What are the odds that we sponsor
the same charity?

35:34.967 --> 35:36.928
She vouches for me, boom, I'm in.

35:37.220 --> 35:40.473
Shit, man, that's some next-level
ass-kissing right there. Respect!

35:40.556 --> 35:42.436
<i>How does this douche
have a nicer watch than me?</i>

35:42.517 --> 35:43.810
<i>Got to be family money.</i>

35:43.893 --> 35:46.521
<i>Shit, I hope no one figures out
that this Rolex is a fake.</i>

35:47.313 --> 35:49.023
- What up, Ali D?
- Gentlemen.

35:49.106 --> 35:52.109
<i>I hate my voice.
I hate my nose. I hate my chin.</i>

35:52.193 --> 35:53.778
<i>I suck, I suck, I suck!</i>

35:54.445 --> 35:57.323
<i>Pretend I'm working,
pretend I'm working, pretend I'm working.</i>

35:57.406 --> 35:59.367
<i>I'm pretty sure
I still reek of tequila.</i>

35:59.450 --> 36:00.969
<i>- No more day drinking.</i>
- Good morning.

36:00.993 --> 36:02.119
<i>Look straight ahead.</i>

36:02.453 --> 36:05.039
<i>God, these piercings hurt.
God, these piercings hurt!</i>

36:05.122 --> 36:06.499
<i>Come on, anal isn't cheating.</i>

36:06.582 --> 36:08.793
<i>I wonder if it's too late
to become a marine biologist.</i>

36:08.876 --> 36:10.395
<i>I don't think this deodorant
is working.</i>

36:10.419 --> 36:11.546
What? The Jets?

36:11.629 --> 36:14.715
Are you fucking kidding me?
Are you fucking kidding me?

36:15.132 --> 36:16.342
See, this is why Dad left.

36:16.425 --> 36:18.803
This is exactly why Dad left
because of shit like this.

36:18.886 --> 36:19.929
Oh, hey, you two.

36:20.471 --> 36:24.976
<i>Ooh, I'd pay $10,000
to see those nipples. Plus tax.</i>

36:32.066 --> 36:34.026
No, this is not happening.
This is not...

36:34.110 --> 36:35.987
Oh, my God, please make it stop!

36:36.070 --> 36:38.215
- Oh, God, you walk fast in those heels.
- Please, God, make it stop.

36:38.239 --> 36:40.908
<i>Is this thing still on?
Testing, testing.</i>

36:40.992 --> 36:43.452
<i>I enjoy apple slices with cinnamon.</i>

36:43.536 --> 36:46.205
Okay, your snack choices
do not interest me right now!

36:46.289 --> 36:49.125
- <i>Oh, I'm so scared.</i>
- I need help! Can't you see that?

36:49.208 --> 36:51.335
Help me! Help me!

36:51.419 --> 36:53.254
- Help me!
- Okay, I'm helping! I'm helping.

36:53.337 --> 36:56.173
I am booking us a psychiatrist
with side-by-side couches.

36:56.257 --> 36:58.718
No, no, no! No more doctors!
I can't handle doctors!

36:58.801 --> 37:00.761
I'm in the middle of too much
work shit for this!

37:00.845 --> 37:02.305
I can't handle this! I can't...

37:02.388 --> 37:07.018
Oh, my God. I'm so hot.
I'm so hot. Oh, my God.

37:07.101 --> 37:09.395
I'm getting hot! I'm hot!

37:09.478 --> 37:11.522
- Do something.
- Okay, okay, okay!

37:11.898 --> 37:13.232
<i>You know what's weird about this?</i>

37:13.316 --> 37:15.902
<i>When people hear voices,
it's usually God or Satan,</i>

37:15.985 --> 37:17.361
<i>not their assistant.</i>

37:17.445 --> 37:20.072
Okay, wait. Let me see something. Move!

37:22.158 --> 37:23.701
<i>Yo, I want some sushi.
But it's Monday.</i>

37:23.784 --> 37:26.344
<i>How many pees a day is too many?
I gotta get my prostate checked.</i>

37:26.412 --> 37:27.788
<i>I am not going back to naked yoga.</i>

37:27.872 --> 37:29.624
<i>Another pair of sneakers?
What the fuck?</i>

37:29.707 --> 37:32.084
<i>- Did I leave the back door open?
- Tinder or Grindr?</i>

37:32.168 --> 37:33.419
<i>Junk, junk, junk in the trunk.</i>

37:33.502 --> 37:35.171
<i>Damn!
How the hell did she get pregnant?</i>

37:35.254 --> 37:36.756
<i>- I pulled out twice.</i>
- Oh, my God!

37:37.381 --> 37:40.676
Okay, so apparently
I only hear men's voices.

37:40.760 --> 37:42.511
And yours.

37:42.595 --> 37:45.181
Okay. Ouch. Wait, wait, wait.

37:45.264 --> 37:47.200
Walk me through last night...
the bachelorette party.

37:47.224 --> 37:49.936
Did... Did you gals get into
any controlled substances?

37:50.019 --> 37:52.104
- Weed? X? Coke? Ayahuasca? Meth?
- A little. No.

37:52.188 --> 37:54.273
- LSD? Fentanyl? Bath salt?
- No!

37:54.357 --> 37:56.651
Are you in a K hole?

37:56.734 --> 37:57.610
Wait.

37:57.693 --> 37:59.487
There was this psychic. Sister.

37:59.570 --> 38:01.238
Yes! Yes! Sister!

38:01.322 --> 38:03.824
And she was supposed to help me
understand men better.

38:03.908 --> 38:06.327
She gave me this tea, this tea,
and she made me drink it.

38:06.410 --> 38:08.496
And it was nasty. It tasted like dirt.

38:08.579 --> 38:10.957
- And you drank it?
- She said to!

38:11.040 --> 38:12.976
I thought black people stopped
drinking tea after <i>Get Out.</i>

38:13.000 --> 38:14.585
You forgot to stay woke.

38:14.669 --> 38:16.754
Shut up! We need to see Sister.

38:25.596 --> 38:26.596
Um, that's it.

38:27.306 --> 38:29.183
"Hot Chocolate Hair Designers"?

38:30.059 --> 38:32.645
- Yeah.
- You drank tea from this place?

38:32.728 --> 38:35.564
- Hey, don't judge me.
- Okay.

38:35.648 --> 38:37.191
Just pull it together
and act normal.

38:37.274 --> 38:40.861
Yeah, girl.
She bleached all his clothes.

38:41.404 --> 38:43.090
- I know, I was looking outside my window.
- I...

38:43.114 --> 38:47.326
Mm-hmm. I woulda did the same thing.
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

38:51.747 --> 38:54.083
Hi, ladies. Excuse me.

38:54.458 --> 38:57.086
I'm looking for a psychic
by the name of Sister.

38:57.169 --> 38:59.088
Um, I heard she works here.

39:01.382 --> 39:04.510
Hey, Sister! You got customers.

39:04.593 --> 39:05.845
Well, send 'em on back.

39:06.262 --> 39:07.263
Through that curtain.

39:11.851 --> 39:14.437
- Come on!
<i>- ♪ Dance with me, dance with me ♪</i>

39:14.520 --> 39:18.357
<i>♪ And romance with me, romance with me ♪</i>

39:18.441 --> 39:24.905
<i>♪ Oh, baby, don't you see me crying? ♪</i>

39:25.406 --> 39:30.202
<i>♪ I'll do you right, right, baby tonight ♪</i>

39:30.286 --> 39:31.454
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:31.537 --> 39:33.622
You looking for indica or sativa?

39:34.165 --> 39:36.917
Look, I got this hybrid
called Gorilla Glue.

39:37.585 --> 39:42.798
Baby, it'll take you up
and then lay you back down to chill.

39:43.466 --> 39:45.551
I'm not here to buy weed.

39:45.634 --> 39:48.220
I actually need psychic advice, please.

39:48.304 --> 39:49.889
I was just kidding.

39:50.222 --> 39:51.140
Oh.

39:51.223 --> 39:54.185
We all know weed is illegal
in the state of Georgia.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.771
- Okay.
- For the moment.

39:56.854 --> 40:00.566
- You can sit over there.
- I can... just get a quick wash.

40:00.649 --> 40:01.649
So...

40:04.111 --> 40:06.238
what can I do for you, baby?

40:07.907 --> 40:12.203
You did a... a tarot reading
at my friend Mari's bachelorette night.

40:12.286 --> 40:14.080
- Mm-hmm.
- And you made me drink

40:14.163 --> 40:16.373
- this really funky tea.
- Mm.

40:16.457 --> 40:19.585
And, um, it messed me up.
So, what was in it?

40:19.668 --> 40:21.420
Oh, that was just jasmine tea.

40:22.546 --> 40:25.007
- Oh.
- And a teeny bit of pot.

40:26.634 --> 40:30.262
And a teeny, tiny bit of... X.

40:30.346 --> 40:32.640
- What?
- FYI, you signed a waiver.

40:32.723 --> 40:34.475
So you dosed me?

40:34.558 --> 40:36.811
No, no, no. Do...
You see, people... People like it.

40:36.894 --> 40:39.897
People enjoy this, generally.
But what do you want me to do?

40:39.980 --> 40:40.815
- Some dry cleaning?
- Mm-mm.

40:40.898 --> 40:42.525
Did she... Did you shit yourself?

40:42.608 --> 40:44.985
- No. No. No.
- Did she shit herself?

40:45.069 --> 40:47.154
- No! No.
- Oh.

40:47.238 --> 40:48.280
Okay, so...

40:49.115 --> 40:52.076
- This tea with ecstasy...
- Okay.

40:52.159 --> 40:55.371
...um, gave me psychic powers.

40:55.955 --> 40:57.123
- And...
- Mm-hmm.

40:57.206 --> 41:01.127
...now, I know you said you wanted
to help me understand men better,

41:01.210 --> 41:05.422
but now... Now I can literally
hear people's inner thoughts.

41:05.506 --> 41:08.134
So, you can hear
what I'm thinking right now?

41:08.634 --> 41:11.095
No. Not you, just... just men.

41:12.471 --> 41:13.514
It's true.

41:13.597 --> 41:16.142
And it's driving me nuts. Please help.

41:17.393 --> 41:19.395
Amazing. Amazing!

41:19.478 --> 41:22.481
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is! That's amazing!

41:22.565 --> 41:24.400
This is the most amazing thing.

41:24.483 --> 41:26.569
- You know the website said...
- Website?

41:26.652 --> 41:29.363
...that this new tea from Haiti
was coldblooded.

41:29.446 --> 41:30.656
It said it was the shit.

41:30.739 --> 41:32.241
But this!

41:33.993 --> 41:36.453
This is a psychic phenomenon.

41:36.537 --> 41:38.372
- No, it's not.
- Look...

41:39.665 --> 41:40.791
you got the shine now.

41:40.875 --> 41:42.755
I don't want the shine.
That doesn't sound good.

41:42.835 --> 41:44.187
- Yeah, you got the shine.
- You got it.

41:44.211 --> 41:46.797
So, what do you think
I'm supposed to do about it?

41:46.881 --> 41:49.008
Well... look.

41:49.091 --> 41:51.468
I know I always said, you know,
"What is he thinking?"

41:51.552 --> 41:52.595
And now I know.

41:52.678 --> 41:54.680
And you don't want to know
because it's not good.

41:54.763 --> 41:58.267
Okay, just please...
get the men out of my head.

41:58.350 --> 42:03.689
So, you're telling me that you came
in here to get rid of this ability?

42:03.772 --> 42:05.858
- Yes.
- Are you crazy?

42:05.941 --> 42:07.818
No. Do you know how many men I work with?

42:07.902 --> 42:10.613
Honey, relax. Breathe.

42:10.905 --> 42:12.239
- Listen, come here.
- What?

42:12.323 --> 42:14.134
- Come, come, come on.
- That's a lot of rocks.

42:14.158 --> 42:15.398
Thank you. Come here, let me...

42:15.451 --> 42:16.928
- Those are nice.
- Thank you, thank you.

42:16.952 --> 42:19.747
- Okay. Oh, God.
- Now, listen. Just calm down.

42:19.830 --> 42:20.830
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

42:20.873 --> 42:22.082
- You feel that?
- Oh, yeah.

42:22.166 --> 42:23.977
- You feel it? Okay. Listen...
- I do. I actually do.

42:24.001 --> 42:25.502
- I feel that.
- Good. Calm down.

42:25.586 --> 42:28.047
- Okay.
- Now, weren't you the one...

42:28.130 --> 42:29.130
Mm.

42:29.173 --> 42:33.344
...complaining about men
holding you down at the job?

42:33.427 --> 42:35.471
- Yeah. That was me.
- Yeah, that was you.

42:35.554 --> 42:37.199
- Yeah, that was good.
- That was you. Uh-huh.

42:37.223 --> 42:39.016
- Yeah, right there. Mm.
- Right here? Okay.

42:39.099 --> 42:41.894
Now, if you can read their thoughts...

42:43.103 --> 42:44.563
how they gonna do that?

42:53.572 --> 42:55.199
You could get inside Joe Dolla's head.

42:55.908 --> 42:58.035
- Or Jamal's.
- You're right.

42:58.494 --> 43:01.080
And I can sign the hell out of him.

43:01.830 --> 43:02.873
There you go.

43:02.957 --> 43:03.957
You know what?

43:03.999 --> 43:05.919
I think I'm gonna hold on
to this gift after all.

43:06.001 --> 43:07.044
Thank you, Sister.

43:11.757 --> 43:13.759
- See you later.
- Kevin, my man.

43:13.842 --> 43:17.054
Do we have any meetings on the books
for Joe Dolla and Jamal yet?

43:17.137 --> 43:19.348
Nothing yet, but we are working on it.

43:19.431 --> 43:22.017
<i>Just poker at Nick's house
tonight, and you're not invited.</i>

43:27.856 --> 43:29.775
Joe Dolla, here I come.

43:36.782 --> 43:39.368
Okay, gentlemen...

43:39.910 --> 43:43.289
I am going to climb into your minds

43:43.789 --> 43:45.416
and empty your wallets.

43:55.217 --> 43:56.427
Hey!

43:56.510 --> 43:58.762
- Ali! What's up?
- Hi.

43:59.221 --> 44:00.806
You here to drop off paperwork?

44:00.889 --> 44:02.474
<i>What the fuck are you doing here?</i>

44:02.558 --> 44:04.935
No, I am here for secret poker night.

44:05.728 --> 44:07.021
Thanks for inviting me finally.

44:07.104 --> 44:08.981
- Hey, I brought a gift.
- It's not a secret.

44:09.064 --> 44:11.317
But super glad
you've been invited... finally.

44:11.400 --> 44:13.736
- Me, too.
- Huh? I invited you? That's...

44:13.819 --> 44:15.571
No, I invited you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:27.291 --> 44:30.919
<i>Pair of sevens?
Fuck it. I'm bluffing these fools.</i>

44:32.129 --> 44:34.631
<i>This is literally
the worst hand ever dealt</i>

44:34.715 --> 44:35.841
<i>in the history of poker.</i>

44:36.633 --> 44:39.219
<i>Three fives, come to papa.</i>

44:41.430 --> 44:42.931
<i>Grant lost some weight.</i>

44:43.390 --> 44:45.768
- Bet's to you, Miss Win-Win.
- Ah.

44:45.851 --> 44:48.729
It's just Miss Win tonight, but I'm in.

44:49.855 --> 44:50.855
Two thou.

44:50.898 --> 44:52.649
<i>And that's a no.</i>

44:55.402 --> 44:58.572
<i>I smell toast. Am I having a stroke?</i>

44:58.655 --> 45:01.658
<i>Wait, I have toast in my pocket.</i>

45:01.742 --> 45:03.035
Okay...

45:04.453 --> 45:06.955
<i>Gotta stop playing poker
with poor people.</i>

45:11.835 --> 45:14.421
<i>Shit, I'm missing</i> Real Housewives.

45:14.505 --> 45:15.505
<i>Nothing.</i>

45:18.133 --> 45:19.510
<i>I'm so rich.</i>

45:21.512 --> 45:24.681
<i>I'm gonna freeze my sperm
and have baby ice cubes.</i>

45:26.934 --> 45:28.227
<i>Ooh, Yahtzee!</i>

45:28.310 --> 45:30.396
<i>All right. Two kings.
Let's look for number three.</i>

45:30.479 --> 45:32.022
<i>You can't win this hand.</i>

45:32.106 --> 45:34.191
<i>Played tight.
It's time to make a push.</i>

45:34.274 --> 45:35.984
<i>Two hearts? Yes!</i>

45:36.068 --> 45:38.612
<i>- Seriously?
- Aw, shit.</i>

45:38.695 --> 45:41.490
<i>Great pot odds,
with two streets to come.</i>

45:41.573 --> 45:43.176
<i>- King of diamonds.
- Nine, five, offsuit.</i>

45:43.200 --> 45:44.618
<i>What am I supposed to do with this?</i>

45:44.701 --> 45:46.036
<i>Never win shit here.</i>

45:48.372 --> 45:50.916
<i>She got balls. Big lady balls.</i>

45:52.751 --> 45:54.002
Young lady...

45:54.962 --> 45:57.756
I see how you winning
all these games and stuff, you know?

45:57.840 --> 46:00.426
And I know there's something
going on, you dig?

46:00.509 --> 46:03.512
It's a numerical anomaly,
that's what it is.

46:04.179 --> 46:07.558
No, Joe. I'm just really good
at reading people.

46:07.641 --> 46:08.642
Like you.

46:09.476 --> 46:11.186
<i>Aw, shit.</i>

46:11.770 --> 46:12.770
<i>What's happening?</i>

46:13.772 --> 46:17.067
Like me! That's what she said.
She said like me.

46:17.443 --> 46:19.361
Like me is a valuable skill, girl.

46:19.445 --> 46:21.780
Uh, it's like being able
to start a fire in the woods.

46:21.864 --> 46:24.199
<i>I should really learn
how to start a fire in the woods.</i>

46:24.283 --> 46:26.869
<i>Then again, when am I ever in the woods?</i>

46:26.952 --> 46:29.663
<i>Squirrels are terrifying. And frogs.</i>

46:29.746 --> 46:32.040
I'll raise you another three.

46:32.124 --> 46:35.669
<i>Statistically, I've got 12 outs
with two streets to come.</i>

46:36.086 --> 46:37.588
The pretzels are delicious.

46:39.089 --> 46:42.176
I feel the heat coming off those cards.
I'm out.

46:52.102 --> 46:54.146
<i>Damn! I got to cut one.</i>

46:54.563 --> 46:55.689
<i>It's that egg salad.</i>

46:56.356 --> 46:58.066
<i>I'll sneak it out with a cough.</i>

47:01.487 --> 47:02.905
<i>- Ew!
- What the fuck?</i>

47:02.988 --> 47:05.491
<i>- Ugh!
- Just... just wow.</i>

47:06.074 --> 47:07.826
<i>Ugh, is that egg salad?</i>

47:07.910 --> 47:09.536
Damn! Could we open up a window?

47:09.995 --> 47:11.955
Whoever did that needs to go see a doctor.

47:15.083 --> 47:18.545
<i>Seven, deuce, offsuit.
Who dealt this shit-ass hand?</i>

47:19.087 --> 47:21.173
<i>Oh, damn it! I did.</i>

47:21.256 --> 47:23.342
<i>Fuck it. I'm gonna take my stand here.</i>

47:23.425 --> 47:25.844
I'll raise you two thousand.

47:28.889 --> 47:31.975
<i>For the love of God, Ali,
don't take all of Joe Dolla's money.</i>

47:32.518 --> 47:34.186
<i>Let the greedy motherfucker win.</i>

47:35.521 --> 47:37.105
<i>I kinda like this crazy woman.</i>

47:37.481 --> 47:39.900
Well, it's just me and you, Joe Dolla.

47:39.983 --> 47:42.861
Alpha Dog vs. Mama Bear!

47:44.112 --> 47:45.906
<i>Is this crazy lady bluffing?</i>

47:46.406 --> 47:48.075
<i>I got to bluff the bluffer.</i>

47:48.367 --> 47:49.826
<i>Make her the bluffee.</i>

47:50.994 --> 47:52.037
I'm all in.

47:52.120 --> 47:54.164
I ain't playing no more games with you.
I'm all in.

47:54.831 --> 47:56.083
I'm all in.

47:57.125 --> 47:59.628
What you got?

48:16.395 --> 48:17.437
Hm.

48:18.522 --> 48:19.856
Well-played, Dolla.

48:23.360 --> 48:25.153
Oh, a little bit of pee came out.

48:26.238 --> 48:29.283
I tell you, this woman's a charm.
She's my good luck charm.

48:29.366 --> 48:31.660
She coming to the meeting tomorrow, Nick?

48:31.743 --> 48:33.537
You got it, Joe. Anything you say.

48:34.121 --> 48:36.331
Wouldn't be a meeting without her.
Right, Ali?

48:36.832 --> 48:38.584
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

48:38.667 --> 48:40.752
That's right, girl, you better not.
You hear me?

48:40.836 --> 48:42.879
<i>What the fuck just happened?</i>

48:43.463 --> 48:44.590
It's a good-looking pot.

48:54.433 --> 48:55.934
<i>Damn, she's fine.</i>

48:56.935 --> 48:58.979
<i>She smells like cigar smoke and whisky.</i>

48:59.688 --> 49:01.481
<i>So sexy. Mm!</i>

49:02.357 --> 49:04.318
<i>Shame she's with that skinny white guy.</i>

49:05.152 --> 49:06.320
<i>How did he get her?</i>

49:07.070 --> 49:08.822
He's gay.

49:08.905 --> 49:11.158
Gay. He's gay.

49:11.742 --> 49:12.742
I'm sorry, what?

49:13.118 --> 49:17.456
Oh, I thought you said something
about the guy that's always with me.

49:17.539 --> 49:18.790
He's my assistant.

49:19.207 --> 49:21.418
He's gay. He's my gay assistant.

49:22.794 --> 49:23.794
Cool.

49:25.464 --> 49:26.965
<i>Wonder if I should ask her out.</i>

49:27.966 --> 49:29.926
<i>Why can't it ever be the woman
who makes the move?</i>

49:31.386 --> 49:35.015
<i>I wish she would just slam me
against these elevator doors and kiss me.</i>

49:36.642 --> 49:37.643
Excuse me?

49:38.727 --> 49:40.354
- What are you doing?
- This.

50:05.170 --> 50:06.838
Whoo!

50:09.591 --> 50:11.069
- Let's take it upstairs to the loft.
- Ooh!

50:11.093 --> 50:12.886
- It's sexier than the bedroom.
- Okay.

50:12.969 --> 50:15.347
Wait, let me freshen up a little bit.

50:15.430 --> 50:16.532
- Bathroom's right there.
- Okay.

50:16.556 --> 50:17.825
- And take your time, okay?
- Okay.

50:17.849 --> 50:19.893
I got to say, it was spooky
how you read my mind.

50:20.268 --> 50:22.729
<i>That was the hottest shit ever.</i>

50:22.813 --> 50:23.939
Mm, mm.

50:24.022 --> 50:27.025
Go get ready, go get ready.
Let me see you walk away.

50:27.734 --> 50:28.777
I'm gonna get so ready.

50:28.860 --> 50:30.904
- Whoo!
<i>- Oh, shit! Oh, damn!</i>

50:30.987 --> 50:33.240
<i>- She could be the one!</i>
- Oh, shit!

50:33.323 --> 50:35.826
You into that African freaky shit.

50:35.909 --> 50:38.328
<i>♪ Ooh, I've been waiting, Lord ♪</i>

51:08.024 --> 51:11.278
Oh. What kind of music is that?

51:11.361 --> 51:15.782
Mm, I really love your artwork.
You're very cultured.

51:15.866 --> 51:17.951
Are you ready? Here I come.

51:18.034 --> 51:21.037
Why are you so quiet?

51:24.666 --> 51:26.546
Before we begin,
we should agree on a safe word.

51:26.626 --> 51:27.502
What the fuck?

51:27.586 --> 51:30.130
No, no. "What the fuck" won't work.
Something more specific.

51:30.213 --> 51:32.591
Yeah, you know what?
I think I left my kid in the back seat.

51:32.674 --> 51:33.800
But you stay right there.

51:33.884 --> 51:35.635
- Hey! Come on!
- No, no, no!

51:35.719 --> 51:37.554
I thought you were the real deal!

51:38.096 --> 51:41.183
Jamal Barry. Now, you are the real deal.

51:41.266 --> 51:44.060
And on behalf of the entire Summit team,

51:44.478 --> 51:48.732
I want to thank you for taking your time
to hear our presentation today.

51:49.232 --> 51:51.752
All right, so I'ma bounce pass this
over to my man Kevin Myrtle.

51:52.194 --> 51:53.403
And he'll take it from here.

51:53.487 --> 51:55.405
- You're in good hands.
- Okay, take it away.

51:56.114 --> 51:58.575
This agency represents
the biggest athletes in the world,

51:58.658 --> 52:02.078
but we here believe
that you can surpass them all

52:02.162 --> 52:05.665
with your skills,
your confidence, your charisma.

52:05.749 --> 52:07.042
We see you

52:07.542 --> 52:10.378
as the athlete that every kid
is gonna want to grow up to be.

52:11.087 --> 52:12.798
Now, this is just a little teaser

52:12.881 --> 52:16.051
of the coming attractions
for Jamal Barry's future.

52:18.220 --> 52:19.054

53:12.023 --> 53:14.025
Nice.

53:14.109 --> 53:15.235
Whoo!

53:19.739 --> 53:21.366
Baller video, Kev.

53:22.367 --> 53:23.660
Now, look, I...

53:24.369 --> 53:26.872
That is a rough edit of, you know,
what we're feeling here.

53:26.955 --> 53:31.084
<i>Ten percent for this reject
'90s Diddy video? Hell, no!</i>

53:31.167 --> 53:32.711
<i>Man, get me out of here.</i>

53:32.794 --> 53:35.005
<i>I just want to play some pickup
at Wabash Park.</i>

53:35.088 --> 53:37.716
Oh, please, please, gentlemen, please.

53:38.508 --> 53:40.927
I think I know
what's on everybody's mind here.

53:41.636 --> 53:43.638
You're not going with Summit.

53:44.681 --> 53:45.682
And why should you?

53:46.182 --> 53:49.895
That cheap '90s rap video
is not who you are.

53:49.978 --> 53:51.313
That's right.

53:51.813 --> 53:55.066
'Cause this boy's body
is a Shinto shrine, okay?

53:55.150 --> 53:58.820
Every breakfast he ever has
is made with my patented smoothie.

53:58.904 --> 54:00.989
<i>Oh, man, not the smoothie rant.</i>

54:01.072 --> 54:06.453
We're talking about kale,
chia seed, coconut juice, avocados.

54:06.536 --> 54:09.039
You know how many avocados
is in this boy's body?

54:09.122 --> 54:10.415
Look at his legs!

54:10.498 --> 54:14.878
On top of that, fish oils, mega-nines,
sometimes fives and sixes.

54:14.961 --> 54:16.546
- Omega.
- Depends on what I have.

54:16.630 --> 54:19.132
Pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds.

54:19.215 --> 54:21.927
- Some pistachios sometimes go in there.
- Okay.

54:22.010 --> 54:23.803
- Whatever it is...
- Sounds healthy.

54:23.887 --> 54:25.180
No, wait a minute!

54:25.263 --> 54:27.557
I put more stuff in it.
Sometimes I add cherries.

54:28.099 --> 54:30.310
A little soy sauce, some duck sauce.

54:30.393 --> 54:32.896
Okay, then I add more chia seed
on top of that!

54:33.271 --> 54:34.898
I care about this here boy.

54:35.482 --> 54:37.275
Okay, Joe...

54:38.026 --> 54:42.530
You could hire a freelance agent
and pay only five percent,

54:42.614 --> 54:45.867
but you would be missing out on what
a full-service agency has to offer.

54:45.951 --> 54:48.828
Besides what,
free Fiji water and a sizzle reel?

54:48.912 --> 54:52.874
Look, building a billion-dollar brand
goes beyond cutting costs. Okay?

54:52.958 --> 54:56.294
It's about developing relationships
with leading sponsors.

54:56.628 --> 54:59.464
Knowing who delivers and who's all hype.

54:59.547 --> 55:02.592
It's installing protections
to keep your money

55:02.676 --> 55:04.594
through injuries, trades.

55:04.678 --> 55:06.930
Look... It's...

55:07.389 --> 55:10.892
It's not really about
our vision for you at all.

55:11.518 --> 55:13.937
It's about what's in your mind, Jamal.

55:14.938 --> 55:15.814
Right on.

55:15.897 --> 55:16.773
<i>That all sounds great,</i>

55:16.856 --> 55:19.693
<i>but what I really could use right now
is a cup of coffee.</i>

55:20.944 --> 55:25.865
Even... if it's as simple
as a cup of coffee.

55:30.328 --> 55:31.328
Damn.

55:32.038 --> 55:34.791
- How'd you know that?
- Just doing my job.

55:35.291 --> 55:37.043
<i>Okay, now she's pissing me off.</i>

55:37.127 --> 55:39.921
<i>- What the fuck just happened?
- I thought that video was awesome.</i>

55:41.589 --> 55:43.008
You know what? To be honest,

55:43.091 --> 55:45.677
I never considered
a female agent until now.

55:45.760 --> 55:48.388
Until Branch Rickey
took a chance on Jackie Robinson,

55:48.471 --> 55:51.599
no one ever considered
a coloured baseball player in the majors.

55:51.683 --> 55:54.477
Well,
Branch Rickey was the mahatma.

55:54.561 --> 55:57.230
- Mm-hmm.
- Only white man deserving of sainthood.

55:57.856 --> 56:00.275
- Abraham Lincoln, Pop.
- But he was part Eskimo.

56:00.358 --> 56:01.901
Mr. Barry's car is at the valet.

56:01.985 --> 56:03.505
Thank you, Brandon. And you know what?

56:03.570 --> 56:05.572
I would love to finish this conversation.

56:05.655 --> 56:07.532
How about I invite you to the Hawks game?

56:07.615 --> 56:09.135
Sunday afternoon? We have a sky suite.

56:09.200 --> 56:11.953
- <i>Skybox... Fuck yes!</i>
- Can't do it. Not gonna happen.

56:12.037 --> 56:13.913
- That's family day. You understand?
- Oh.

56:14.330 --> 56:17.042
Hey, Sly and the Family Stone
could be coming out of seclusion.

56:17.125 --> 56:19.210
I mean, it could be an asteroid
coming towards Earth.

56:19.294 --> 56:20.211
"Oh, no, no!"

56:20.295 --> 56:21.671
Not gonna happen, you understand?

56:21.755 --> 56:23.715
- 'Cause we lock it down.
<i>- Damn.</i>

56:23.798 --> 56:25.818
But you know something,
you wouldn't understand that,

56:25.842 --> 56:27.442
'cause you're not, like, a family woman.

56:28.303 --> 56:30.346
What makes you think
I'm not a family woman?

56:30.430 --> 56:32.015
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

56:32.098 --> 56:34.392
No disrespect. I mean, you doing you.

56:34.476 --> 56:36.328
But this is a different set
of values right here.

56:36.352 --> 56:38.146
You know, we all about the roots.

56:38.229 --> 56:40.356
- So this is about the roots, it's deep.
- Roots.

56:40.440 --> 56:42.025
<i>I don't trust a woman
with no family.</i>

56:42.484 --> 56:45.570
<i>Like I don't trust a man with no eyebrows
and too many keys.</i>

56:53.286 --> 56:57.457
As a matter of fact,
I will bring my family.

56:58.541 --> 56:59.751
There they are, right there.

56:59.834 --> 57:02.295
There, both of them, the big one
and the little. Hey, Will!

57:02.378 --> 57:04.756
Hey! Hey! Will! Will!

57:04.839 --> 57:06.341
Come over here.

57:06.424 --> 57:08.259
Uh, who are they?

57:08.343 --> 57:11.096
- This is your husband?
- Ah, the man put a ring on it.

57:11.179 --> 57:14.015
Oh, yeah! Did you want me to have
your family wait upstairs?

57:14.099 --> 57:15.391
No, I need you to roll calls.

57:15.475 --> 57:17.393
- Roll calls, Brandon.
- Okay.

57:17.477 --> 57:19.938
Hey! Hey.

57:20.355 --> 57:21.189
- Hey.
- Hey.

57:21.272 --> 57:23.483
<i>Oh, now she's smiling?
Clearly crazy.</i>

57:23.566 --> 57:24.901
<i>Who the fuck are they?</i>

57:25.985 --> 57:29.906
Um, Will, this is Jamal Barry
and his dad, Joe Dolla.

57:29.989 --> 57:31.241
That's Ben.

57:31.324 --> 57:32.992
<i>Holy shit, it is.</i>

57:33.076 --> 57:34.716
- Wassup, man?
- What's goin' on, brother?

57:35.245 --> 57:36.996
Yeah, bring it on in here, playa!

57:37.455 --> 57:39.707
Right on. That's a live one on your hands.

57:39.958 --> 57:41.668
Oh, yes, I'm alive.

57:41.751 --> 57:43.628
You talking about him?

57:44.838 --> 57:45.880
You got me!

57:45.964 --> 57:48.216
He's a funny fella.
This guy's a prankster.

57:48.299 --> 57:49.342
He is.

57:50.009 --> 57:51.344
Ow.

57:51.427 --> 57:53.263
I dig this here, but you know what?

57:53.346 --> 57:54.782
I'ma let y'all have your family time.

57:54.806 --> 57:56.726
Girl, you look like
you spit this little boy out.

57:56.808 --> 57:57.851
"Family time"?

57:57.934 --> 57:59.435
You look just like your mother, boy.

57:59.519 --> 58:01.896
Okay, I'll talk to you later.
All right! Yes.

58:02.397 --> 58:04.107
So, hey, what are you guys doing here?

58:04.899 --> 58:07.152
Go ahead, do your thing. Show her.

58:07.235 --> 58:11.072
Sorry. I found your licence
on the floor in my dad's room.

58:11.156 --> 58:14.534
And I'm also sorry for wearing
your underwear on my head.

58:14.617 --> 58:17.036
Okay. Thank you. Um...

58:17.328 --> 58:18.681
And, you know,
I should probably apologise

58:18.705 --> 58:20.707
for leaving your house in such a frenzy,
I just...

58:21.124 --> 58:23.168
I can be short with people sometimes.

58:23.668 --> 58:25.837
I'm sure you probably thought I was crazy.

58:26.546 --> 58:29.549
<i>Crazy people don't think
they're crazy, so maybe she's not.</i>

58:30.425 --> 58:32.844
- Mm-hmm.
- Can you try to be nice to my dad?

58:32.927 --> 58:35.513
Ever since Mom died,
Dad's been very lonely.

58:35.597 --> 58:38.683
- What?
- Whoa, whoa, hey, hey. It's okay, buddy.

58:38.766 --> 58:40.643
Why didn't you say that to me
in the beginning?

58:40.977 --> 58:43.104
Well, I was gonna tell you that morning,

58:43.188 --> 58:45.231
but you ran out so fast, you...

58:46.107 --> 58:47.775
You know, I'm... I'm sorry about...

58:47.859 --> 58:49.527
<i>Wait, why am I apologising to her?</i>

58:49.611 --> 58:50.695
<i>I didn't do nothing wrong.</i>

58:50.778 --> 58:53.072
You know what?
Why don't I make it up to both of you

58:53.156 --> 58:56.159
and invite you to the Hawks
and Timberwolves game on Sunday?

58:56.242 --> 58:57.285
We have a skybox.

58:57.368 --> 59:00.872
<i>Karl-Anthony Towns? Skybox!</i>

59:01.456 --> 59:02.665
- You serious?
- Yes.

59:03.082 --> 59:05.543
Well, yeah. Yeah, that'd be nice.

59:05.627 --> 59:08.227
- Okay, well, I'll see you Sunday. Great.
- All right, cool, cool.

59:17.388 --> 59:19.098
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Mm-hmm.

59:24.020 --> 59:26.689
Hey, that was supposed to be
a team presentation,

59:26.773 --> 59:29.108
not some bullshit "You go, girl" moment.

59:29.192 --> 59:30.568
The only bullshit in that room

59:30.652 --> 59:33.696
was that racist
<i>Lifestyle of the Rich and Clueless</i> shit!

59:33.780 --> 59:35.657
<i>Ball-busting bitch!</i>

59:36.866 --> 59:40.578
Well, if Team Bro would listen to a sister
every once in a while,

59:40.662 --> 59:42.747
maybe I wouldn't have to be
a ball-busting bitch.

59:42.830 --> 59:43.998
I did not say that.

59:44.082 --> 59:45.458
<i>Shit, did I?</i>

59:45.541 --> 59:47.126
If you didn't, you thought it.

59:47.585 --> 59:49.379
<i>Stop moving the car.</i>

59:50.922 --> 59:53.383
<i>Stop moving the fucking car.</i>

59:54.092 --> 59:56.970
I know it was you
who voted me down from partner.

59:57.053 --> 01:00:00.223
What? I voted to make you partner
every single time,

01:00:00.306 --> 01:00:02.475
and please stop moving the fucking car!

01:00:02.558 --> 01:00:04.602
<i>Maybe I shouldn't have.
You're crazy as fuck.</i>

01:00:05.061 --> 01:00:06.061
Wait.

01:00:07.814 --> 01:00:08.940
You really voted for me?

01:00:09.023 --> 01:00:11.859
Yes! This is a business.
I'm a numbers guy.

01:00:11.943 --> 01:00:13.361
You get the numbers. End of story.

01:00:13.444 --> 01:00:16.322
All right, so if it wasn't you,
then who was it?

01:00:16.406 --> 01:00:17.949
I don't know. It could've been anyone!

01:00:18.032 --> 01:00:19.792
It's not like you have
a lot of friends here.

01:00:19.867 --> 01:00:21.661
You're constantly
throwing the first punch,

01:00:21.744 --> 01:00:23.621
and you got you and no one else.

01:00:25.832 --> 01:00:28.418
That's bullshit.
That's bullshit.

01:00:28.501 --> 01:00:31.671
Because if I were a man,
people would say I play hard.

01:00:31.754 --> 01:00:34.382
<i>If you were a man,
people would say that you were a dick.</i>

01:00:37.635 --> 01:00:39.178
Well, thanks for the talk.

01:00:39.262 --> 01:00:42.181
It's always nice for a woman
to be called a dick.

01:00:44.309 --> 01:00:45.351
Wha...

01:00:45.435 --> 01:00:47.270
I did not say that.

01:00:47.353 --> 01:00:50.440
<i>No more dating strippers
unless Fantasia calls me back.</i>

01:00:50.523 --> 01:00:52.734
<i>I'm getting fat. Like, Rerun fat.</i>

01:00:52.817 --> 01:00:55.445
Hey, Ali. I heard you crushed
your Jamal Barry meeting. Nice.

01:00:55.528 --> 01:00:56.904
<i>I'm so hot for you!</i>

01:00:56.988 --> 01:00:59.466
<i>I wish I could scream it out loud,
but no one would understand.</i>

01:00:59.490 --> 01:01:01.284
Oh, Danny, thank you. You're so sweet.

01:01:01.367 --> 01:01:03.202
<i>Don't think I don't see
that big-ass dick</i>

01:01:03.286 --> 01:01:04.704
<i>trying to bust through those pants.</i>

01:01:05.663 --> 01:01:06.663
What did you say?

01:01:08.124 --> 01:01:09.375
We didn't say anything.

01:01:09.876 --> 01:01:11.753
I'm gonna, uh... go back to my desk.

01:01:11.836 --> 01:01:13.796
Um, I'll see you two later.

01:01:15.298 --> 01:01:17.050
<i>You and me, Brandon, someday.</i>

01:01:33.566 --> 01:01:37.153
So, Nick, what'd Ali mention
about five-percent commission?

01:01:37.236 --> 01:01:39.197
Five-percent commission. She's hilarious.

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.448
Would you excuse me a second?

01:01:42.784 --> 01:01:45.453
So when is this fabulous
fake family gonna show?

01:01:45.536 --> 01:01:46.537
They will be here.

01:01:46.621 --> 01:01:48.748
Well, the Barry Bunch keep asking for him.

01:01:49.374 --> 01:01:52.001
- Hey.
- Hey!

01:01:52.794 --> 01:01:55.004
- Hey, sorry we're late.
- I know, honey.

01:01:55.088 --> 01:01:56.631
You had a rough day.

01:01:56.964 --> 01:01:59.717
And you, you little... thing.

01:02:01.094 --> 01:02:02.095
Go.

01:02:03.262 --> 01:02:04.472
Hey, yo, Ali!

01:02:04.931 --> 01:02:07.809
I have a monumentally important question
to ask you.

01:02:07.892 --> 01:02:10.269
- Okay.
- Do you trust Elon Musk?

01:02:10.353 --> 01:02:12.688
'Cause that man is one white glove
and metal hand away

01:02:12.772 --> 01:02:14.440
from being a James Bond villain.

01:02:14.732 --> 01:02:15.608
Freaky.

01:02:15.691 --> 01:02:17.527
Hey, thanks again for inviting us, Ali.

01:02:17.610 --> 01:02:18.903
- Okay, yes.
- Appreciate you.

01:02:18.986 --> 01:02:20.863
- Wassup, Will?
- Wassup, Jamal?

01:02:20.947 --> 01:02:22.341
- What's going on, man?
- Hey, man. You good?

01:02:22.365 --> 01:02:24.867
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah, yeah, I'm... I'm... I'm good.

01:02:24.951 --> 01:02:27.537
<i>Holy shit, Jamal Barry
remembered my name!</i>

01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:28.996
That skank is a ho.

01:02:29.831 --> 01:02:31.749
Ali Cat and Will of the People,

01:02:31.833 --> 01:02:34.752
that is my baby girl, my wife. Loretta!

01:02:34.836 --> 01:02:37.422
I know, bitch is always talking shit
about other people.

01:02:37.505 --> 01:02:40.216
Her nappy weave
is some virgin hair from Peru.

01:02:40.299 --> 01:02:42.927
- I'm fine.
- Baby, will you please get off the phone?

01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:44.720
You said this was family day.

01:02:44.804 --> 01:02:46.472
I know. I'm talking to my mother.

01:02:46.556 --> 01:02:47.723
Oh, I didn't know.

01:02:48.683 --> 01:02:49.559
Look, Ma, I got to go.

01:02:49.642 --> 01:02:51.644
<i>If she botches this, she is fired.</i>

01:02:51.727 --> 01:02:53.396
And, baby, this is Ali.

01:02:53.479 --> 01:02:55.159
She's the one I demolished in poker night.

01:02:55.231 --> 01:02:57.358
- Mm.
- I brought out the alpha dogs.

01:02:57.817 --> 01:03:00.987
Is that the same alpha dog
who was supposed to get me a pinot grigio?

01:03:01.070 --> 01:03:02.339
You know,
I tell you what, Mrs. Barry,

01:03:02.363 --> 01:03:04.365
why don't I step out
to the main bar with you

01:03:04.449 --> 01:03:06.742
and then I can get
some Mama Jamal stories, huh?

01:03:06.826 --> 01:03:08.536
- Hey, bubby, don't be long!
- Mm-hmm.

01:03:08.619 --> 01:03:09.829
You're my oxygen!

01:03:12.957 --> 01:03:15.084
<i>Now, this is the court
I want to play on.</i>

01:03:18.504 --> 01:03:19.864
- Ben, come here.
- Ben, come here.

01:03:20.339 --> 01:03:22.633
- Ben, come here.
- Ben-Ben, come here. Here, now.

01:03:23.176 --> 01:03:25.416
- Ben. Ben-ben, come here.
- No, Ben. Come, come, come...

01:03:26.262 --> 01:03:27.698
- Ben, Ben, come here.
- Ben, come here.

01:03:27.722 --> 01:03:29.682
- Ben, Ben.
- Ben.

01:03:30.141 --> 01:03:31.350
- Ben.
- Ben. Come...

01:03:31.893 --> 01:03:33.603
- Ben, come here.
- Ben, Ben, come here.

01:03:33.978 --> 01:03:36.981
Wow! Y'all are cute, man. Y'all so cute!

01:03:37.064 --> 01:03:39.859
Ahh!

01:03:39.942 --> 01:03:42.028
Like peanut butter and jelly
and pickled herring,

01:03:42.111 --> 01:03:43.613
you know,
but you got arms and legs.

01:03:44.030 --> 01:03:46.491
- That's so us.
- How did y'all meet?

01:03:46.824 --> 01:03:48.493
- Uh... I'll take it! We...
- Well, I...

01:03:49.702 --> 01:03:51.704
Uh, well, it's kind of embarrassing.

01:03:52.330 --> 01:03:53.748
It was a one-night stand.

01:03:54.123 --> 01:03:56.876
Wow, nice! Yeah, nice.

01:03:56.959 --> 01:03:59.879
Hey, ain't nothing wrong with a little bit
of shame in the Walk of Shame.

01:03:59.962 --> 01:04:01.642
You know what I'm saying?
That's a paradox.

01:04:01.714 --> 01:04:03.754
But now y'all can enjoy
your fruits of y'all labour,

01:04:03.799 --> 01:04:06.093
'cause that's what it's about!
You know, 'cause...

01:04:06.177 --> 01:04:08.387
<i>What in the fuck
is he talking about?</i>

01:04:08.471 --> 01:04:09.555
Fruits, he's...

01:04:09.639 --> 01:04:11.557
Little man!
You planning being a baller someday?

01:04:11.641 --> 01:04:15.102
Oh, yes! Ben... Big Ben loves basketball.
Isn't that right, Ben?

01:04:15.186 --> 01:04:17.522
I don't... I don't really...
I don't really think so.

01:04:17.605 --> 01:04:18.814
Actually, no. You know...

01:04:18.898 --> 01:04:20.618
He finds the craziest stuff
on the Internet.

01:04:20.691 --> 01:04:22.902
- Yes, he does.
- I got to limit his screen time.

01:04:22.985 --> 01:04:24.946
You know?
Because me, you know, I'm a single...

01:04:25.029 --> 01:04:27.448
- Uh, you know what?
- I am... parched.

01:04:27.532 --> 01:04:29.408
Can you please get me some wine, baby?

01:04:29.784 --> 01:04:31.762
Yeah, yeah. What do you want?
They got red, white...

01:04:31.786 --> 01:04:33.955
It doesn't matter. Surprise me.

01:04:34.038 --> 01:04:36.165
- Go get some. Just go get me some.
- Ali.

01:04:36.249 --> 01:04:37.750
Ah, you know me.

01:04:37.833 --> 01:04:38.834
Get me some!

01:04:39.293 --> 01:04:40.896
- Surprise me!
- You've got a strong hand.

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:42.064
- Oh, you so crazy!
- It's strong.

01:04:42.088 --> 01:04:44.674
- He's silly.
- He don't know your wine preference?

01:04:44.757 --> 01:04:46.926
Oh, he does.
We just like surprises, that's all.

01:04:47.009 --> 01:04:49.428
Guess what? My birthday's next week.

01:04:49.929 --> 01:04:51.806
Ooh! How old you gonna be?

01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:53.890
Tell him, Ben.

01:04:53.933 --> 01:04:55.059
Six.

01:04:55.476 --> 01:04:56.476
Six.

01:04:56.519 --> 01:04:57.879
You gonna blow it out, little man?

01:04:57.937 --> 01:04:59.647
Yes! We're gonna do it really big.

01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:01.899
We're gonna do big things
for his birthday. Right, Ben?

01:05:01.983 --> 01:05:04.652
- You are?
- Yeah! Really big.

01:05:04.944 --> 01:05:08.322
If we're talking blowout,
what I really wanted is

01:05:08.406 --> 01:05:10.449
a cake shaped like a sports car.

01:05:10.533 --> 01:05:13.536
Oh, you got it, Ben! You got it.

01:05:13.619 --> 01:05:14.619
Promise?

01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:16.163
Yes, I promise.

01:05:16.247 --> 01:05:17.957
What... Wait, wait... Oh!

01:05:19.208 --> 01:05:21.085
That's a beautiful thing, girl.

01:05:21.502 --> 01:05:22.503
Ooh-hoo-hoo.

01:05:23.921 --> 01:05:27.383
Well, thank you so much for coming.
I hope you had a good time.

01:05:27.466 --> 01:05:29.594
Oh, no. We had an amazing time.
Thank you.

01:05:29.677 --> 01:05:32.305
Hey, um, how about tomorrow night
I'll take you out?

01:05:32.972 --> 01:05:35.558
But we gonna do something
a little bit more low-key than, uh...

01:05:35.641 --> 01:05:37.893
- Oh, yeah, sure! Sure.
- Yeah, okay.

01:05:37.977 --> 01:05:40.187
Okay, well, you go ahead home.

01:05:40.271 --> 01:05:42.565
- Oh, hey!
- Wha... What...

01:05:42.648 --> 01:05:44.734
- Good night! Good night. Ohh!
- Uh, okay...

01:05:44.817 --> 01:05:46.777
Make sure you put him into bed.
I'll see you soon.

01:05:46.861 --> 01:05:48.213
- I got it, I got it.
- All right, okay.

01:05:48.237 --> 01:05:51.657
This boy get up and he drink smoothies
16 times a day.

01:05:51.741 --> 01:05:54.201
Sometimes he get the runs,
but it's all good.

01:05:54.285 --> 01:05:55.786
That's only when his mother make it.

01:05:55.870 --> 01:05:57.723
You know what I'm saying?
'Cause she just overloads.

01:05:57.747 --> 01:05:58.747
Ali?

01:05:59.373 --> 01:06:00.791
Karl-Anthony!

01:06:00.875 --> 01:06:03.252
- How you doing, sweetheart?
- Great game, baby!

01:06:03.336 --> 01:06:05.272
Triple double and we didn't win.
So, it don't mean shit.

01:06:05.296 --> 01:06:06.982
- You know how that go.
- Those numbers, though.

01:06:07.006 --> 01:06:09.550
You keep putting those numbers up.
Hey, Jamal!

01:06:09.634 --> 01:06:11.194
Come here, I got somebody
I want you to meet.

01:06:11.218 --> 01:06:13.030
- Oh, that's your mans?
- Well, I'm working on it.

01:06:13.054 --> 01:06:15.514
- I feels you.
<i>- Holy shit! Don't freak out.</i>

01:06:15.598 --> 01:06:17.308
<i>It's Karl-Anthony! Yo, he's looking at me!</i>

01:06:17.391 --> 01:06:18.391
Yo, Jamal Barry, right?

01:06:18.893 --> 01:06:20.895
- Yes, sir. Yep.
- Appreciate it, man. Much love.

01:06:20.978 --> 01:06:22.706
- Nice to meet you.
- Absolutely. Absolutely.

01:06:22.730 --> 01:06:25.650
<i>Holy shit!
Uh, hey, hey, don't freak out.</i>

01:06:25.733 --> 01:06:27.943
Yo, I've been watching you
since high school, man.

01:06:28.027 --> 01:06:30.154
I must say, young fella,
I'm pretty impressed.

01:06:30.488 --> 01:06:32.782
- Oh, for real?
- Yeah, man, you're killing it.

01:06:32.865 --> 01:06:35.159
- Cool. Yeah, yeah, that's cool.
<i>- Kid's nervous.</i>

01:06:35.242 --> 01:06:37.953
<i>Probably thinking,
"Holy shit, it's Karl-Anthony Towns!"</i>

01:06:38.037 --> 01:06:40.748
<i>Holy shit,
it's Karl-Anthony Towns!</i>

01:06:40.831 --> 01:06:44.335
Karl-Anthony, do you have any advice
for our young fella here?

01:06:44.418 --> 01:06:46.170
Listen, man, for real,

01:06:46.253 --> 01:06:48.547
you got great things ahead of you,
but always remember,

01:06:48.881 --> 01:06:51.342
no one has ever become a star
playing for himself.

01:06:51.425 --> 01:06:52.802
Always got to keep the team first.

01:06:52.885 --> 01:06:57.932
<i>♪ If you like piña coladas
And getting caught in the rain ♪</i>

01:06:58.015 --> 01:07:00.685
<i>Damn! Got to get that stupid song
out of my head.</i>

01:07:00.768 --> 01:07:02.353
- You feel me?
- Totally.

01:07:02.436 --> 01:07:04.355
<i>I have no idea what he just said.</i>

01:07:05.106 --> 01:07:07.566
- Oh, shit. I'll see you.
- Yo, Karl!

01:07:08.067 --> 01:07:10.111
Hey, Karl! Hey, Karl!

01:07:10.194 --> 01:07:13.572
Hey, I got a way to disrupt
the children's beverage sector!

01:07:13.989 --> 01:07:15.366
That was a great game, right?

01:07:16.033 --> 01:07:18.911
Well, just give me a call
if you need anything else, okay?

01:07:18.994 --> 01:07:21.539
As a matter of fact,
there is something I need.

01:07:21.622 --> 01:07:24.625
Can I get a ballpark estimate
of what kind of deals we expect?

01:07:24.709 --> 01:07:27.187
You know what I'm saying?
Just for financial planning purposes.

01:07:27.211 --> 01:07:31.173
Pops, you can't ask her to do work for us
if you haven't signed with her agency.

01:07:31.257 --> 01:07:32.675
Yeah, but if I like what I hear,

01:07:32.758 --> 01:07:35.177
we can say we got ourselves an agent.

01:07:39.724 --> 01:07:42.393
Brandon! Can you get me
some coffee, please? Thank you.

01:07:42.476 --> 01:07:44.645
<i>Peach cobbler, peach cobbler,
peach cobbler.</i>

01:07:44.729 --> 01:07:46.814
<i>Peach cobbler with blueberries.</i>

01:07:46.897 --> 01:07:49.275
<i>Peach cobbler warmed up. Peach cobbler.</i>

01:07:49.358 --> 01:07:50.877
- What are you mumbling about?
<i>- Peach cobbler Ã  la mode.</i>

01:07:50.901 --> 01:07:53.237
I am thinking about my favourite dessert

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:55.281
so that you can't hear my actual thoughts.

01:07:55.364 --> 01:07:58.075
Oh, no, no, no. Out with it. Come, come.

01:07:58.159 --> 01:07:59.994
I believe you are a good person.

01:08:00.077 --> 01:08:02.455
So, I am choosing to chalk
this fake-family business

01:08:02.538 --> 01:08:04.707
up to an overabundance
of competitive spirit.

01:08:04.790 --> 01:08:06.917
- Give me my coffee.
- There, I said it.

01:08:08.127 --> 01:08:10.087
- Please.
- Oh, Speak of the devil,

01:08:10.171 --> 01:08:12.173
here is your fake husband now.

01:08:12.757 --> 01:08:15.259
Aw, Will is inviting you
to hang out tonight.

01:08:15.342 --> 01:08:16.176
No.

01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:19.345
- "That sounds like fun."
- What are you doing?

01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:21.682
- "Let's do it."
- Uh, no.

01:08:21.765 --> 01:08:22.767
Can you stop typing?

01:08:22.850 --> 01:08:24.143
I'm not going on a date tonight!

01:08:24.769 --> 01:08:28.898
"Any way I could bring my friend Mari..."

01:08:28.981 --> 01:08:30.941
- Wha...
- "...and her fiancé?

01:08:31.024 --> 01:08:34.194
Just realised we had plans.
Could be a fun double date."

01:08:34.278 --> 01:08:35.446
- Exclamation point.
- No, no!

01:08:35.529 --> 01:08:36.654
- We do not...
- Send.

01:08:36.738 --> 01:08:39.700
I don't have plans with her.
Come here, you little...

01:08:41.076 --> 01:08:42.661
I don't have plans with Mari.

01:08:42.745 --> 01:08:44.412
Exactly, and she's getting resentful.

01:08:44.497 --> 01:08:46.377
This way, you knock out
two birds with one stone

01:08:46.415 --> 01:08:48.626
while using Mari and James as a buffer.
You're welcome.

01:08:50.836 --> 01:08:52.962
Okay, fine. Fine.

01:08:53.046 --> 01:08:56.591
But you agented me,
and agents do not like being agented.

01:08:56.675 --> 01:08:59.011
<i>Too bad.
And I should be an agent.</i>

01:08:59.094 --> 01:09:02.473
- What?
- You heard me, loud and clear.

01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:07.853
So, you think you got what it takes
to be a good sports agent. Really?

01:09:07.937 --> 01:09:09.577
What do... what do you know about sports?

01:09:09.604 --> 01:09:12.483
- <i>Oh, basically everything!</i>
- Oh, please.

01:09:12.566 --> 01:09:14.151
<i>I'll bet you didn't know
that Tom Brady,</i>

01:09:14.234 --> 01:09:16.362
<i>the 199th pick of the 2000 NFL draft,</i>

01:09:16.444 --> 01:09:18.404
<i>has more playoff touchdown passes, 68,</i>

01:09:18.488 --> 01:09:20.866
<i>than number-one picks David Carr, 65,
and Tim Couch, 64,</i>

01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:22.660
<i>had in their entire careers.</i>

01:09:22.743 --> 01:09:24.411
- I knew that.
- Oh, yeah?

01:09:24.828 --> 01:09:27.122
And do you know what happened
on June 25, 2009?

01:09:28.415 --> 01:09:29.625
Michael Jackson passed. Ha!

01:09:31.085 --> 01:09:32.795
True. And tragic.

01:09:32.877 --> 01:09:35.171
But it was also the day
that Steph Curry was selected

01:09:35.256 --> 01:09:38.259
as the seventh overall pick
in the 2009 NBA draft

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:39.510
by the Golden State Warriors,

01:09:39.593 --> 01:09:44.598
with a contract totalling $12.7 million
over four years.

01:09:45.224 --> 01:09:47.017
Isn't that great?

01:09:47.518 --> 01:09:49.895
You know sports trivia. That's beautiful.

01:09:49.979 --> 01:09:51.604
But it takes more to being an agent.

01:09:51.689 --> 01:09:53.529
You have to know
how to handle people, sweetie.

01:09:53.607 --> 01:09:56.068
<i>Oh, you mean like when
I stopped you from handing Rafael Nadal</i>

01:09:56.151 --> 01:09:58.871
<i>a passed appetiser with ham in it
because I read in his autobiography</i>

01:09:58.946 --> 01:10:00.786
<i>that he hates ham, cheese,
storms, and animals?</i>

01:10:00.865 --> 01:10:03.158
<i>- Okurrr!</i>
- Mm.

01:10:03.242 --> 01:10:04.869
Oops, sorry. Did that slip out?

01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:07.288
Ooh. Someone's in a mood.

01:10:07.371 --> 01:10:10.040
Oh! I have a pick-me-up.

01:10:10.541 --> 01:10:12.376
You have a secret admirer.

01:10:12.459 --> 01:10:14.837
Oh, please. You are just trying
to change the subject,

01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:16.547
- and it is not going to work.
- Mm-mmm.

01:10:17.172 --> 01:10:18.549
<i>Okay, tell me who it is.</i>

01:10:19.383 --> 01:10:22.970
Well, apparently, Puppy Dog Danny
wasn't crushing on me.

01:10:23.053 --> 01:10:24.680
It's you he wants to mount.

01:10:24.763 --> 01:10:26.307
Ooh, there he is.

01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:27.892
How big you think Shaq's dick is?

01:10:27.975 --> 01:10:31.145
Yeah, he's closeted, honey.

01:10:31.687 --> 01:10:34.690
And he wants to pound
on your booty cheeks.

01:10:35.232 --> 01:10:37.610
I don't know why. But there you have it.

01:10:57.338 --> 01:10:59.715
Ohh! Ho-ho!

01:10:59.798 --> 01:11:02.176
You suck so bad.

01:11:02.259 --> 01:11:04.219
You look like you had a seizure, girl.

01:11:04.303 --> 01:11:06.847
You can just pick up the ball
and drop it in the hole next time.

01:11:06.931 --> 01:11:09.350
Really?
You know, both of y'all can shut up.

01:11:10.184 --> 01:11:11.310
Nice shot, baby.

01:11:11.894 --> 01:11:12.894
Bam!

01:11:17.775 --> 01:11:19.652
Hey, can I get some more limes, please?

01:11:19.735 --> 01:11:20.778
Sure.

01:11:20.861 --> 01:11:22.112
Here you go, keep the change.

01:11:22.947 --> 01:11:24.156
- Thanks.
- That's right.

01:11:24.239 --> 01:11:25.491
<i>Man, look at that ass!</i>

01:11:25.991 --> 01:11:27.576
<i>I should tap that before the wedding.</i>

01:11:28.202 --> 01:11:29.328
<i>Shit, or after.</i>

01:11:30.537 --> 01:11:32.081
- You up, Ali.
- Mm-hmm.

01:11:33.874 --> 01:11:35.793
- Excuse me.
- Go ahead.

01:11:36.377 --> 01:11:37.711
Oh!

01:11:37.795 --> 01:11:38.712
- Shit!
- Ali!

01:11:38.796 --> 01:11:41.131
What the fuck? Those are his nuts!

01:11:41.215 --> 01:11:43.425
Which are getting married to me Saturday,

01:11:43.509 --> 01:11:45.970
- and I want them in good shape.
- Both balls, honey.

01:11:46.053 --> 01:11:47.137
- Both of 'em?
- Yeah.

01:11:47.221 --> 01:11:49.098
<i>Man, why is Mari
even friends with Ali?</i>

01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:51.392
<i>She only gives a shit
about herself anyways.</i>

01:11:51.475 --> 01:11:52.518
<i>Always flaking.</i>

01:11:53.102 --> 01:11:55.604
<i>Only reason she's here tonight
is to show off her new guy.</i>

01:11:55.896 --> 01:11:58.148
<i>What he wearing anyway? Tight-ass jeans.</i>

01:11:58.232 --> 01:12:01.193
- Uh, are you having fun?
- Yeah.

01:12:01.443 --> 01:12:03.003
- Work hard, play hard, right?
- Mm-hmm.

01:12:03.070 --> 01:12:04.905
Uh-huh.

01:12:07.992 --> 01:12:10.786
- Anyone need anything else?
- No, we're good, thanks.

01:12:12.413 --> 01:12:14.540
- Nice shot.
- Thanks.

01:12:17.876 --> 01:12:21.171
Well, look at you,
impressing all the ladies.

01:12:21.255 --> 01:12:22.965
Her?

01:12:23.424 --> 01:12:24.424
Whatever.

01:12:24.675 --> 01:12:26.552
<i>Why would I waste a second on her</i>

01:12:26.635 --> 01:12:28.721
<i>when I got you standing
right here in front of me?</i>

01:12:33.976 --> 01:12:34.976
Um...

01:12:35.269 --> 01:12:36.395
You know what?

01:12:36.478 --> 01:12:38.188
Why don't you show me how to play?

01:12:38.272 --> 01:12:39.857
'Cause I suck.

01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:41.442
- I would love to.
- Okay.

01:12:41.525 --> 01:12:43.569
And to be clear,
if I'm putting my arms around you,

01:12:43.652 --> 01:12:45.237
if I'm holding your hips,

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:46.840
it's just to get your pool shot right.

01:12:46.905 --> 01:12:49.366
- You're being professional.
- Just strictly professional.

01:12:49.450 --> 01:12:51.076
You know,
I just care about my job.

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:53.537
- Okay, come on.
- I'm good at my job.

01:13:42.628 --> 01:13:44.588
- Ah.
- Whoo!

01:13:44.671 --> 01:13:47.216
<i>Oh, okay, okay.
Slow down. Slow... Wait.</i>

01:13:47.716 --> 01:13:50.636
<i>- Slow down, girl. This isn't a rodeo.</i>
- Ah!

01:13:51.762 --> 01:13:53.972
<i>Yeah... Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Easy with the balls!</i>

01:13:54.056 --> 01:13:56.183
<i>Easy with the balls.
They're attached to me.</i>

01:13:57.893 --> 01:14:00.395
<i>Why are her eyes always closed?
Am I that ugly?</i>

01:14:00.729 --> 01:14:02.231
Oh, what the...

01:14:02.981 --> 01:14:05.317
<i>Damn, her eyes opened,
but she look crazy as hell.</i>

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:06.902
<i>They were better closed.</i>

01:14:06.985 --> 01:14:07.985
<i>Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa...</i>

01:14:08.028 --> 01:14:10.114
<i>God, easy on the balls.</i>

01:14:17.121 --> 01:14:18.413
What's up? You okay?

01:14:20.624 --> 01:14:24.545
Just admit it. This wasn't going so good.

01:14:24.628 --> 01:14:25.963
What?

01:14:26.046 --> 01:14:28.173
No, it was, it was, it was...

01:14:28.882 --> 01:14:29.883
It was cool.

01:14:31.009 --> 01:14:33.095
Okay, look. How about...

01:14:34.596 --> 01:14:37.099
How about we try something
a little different tonight?

01:14:37.182 --> 01:14:38.182
Uh, like what?

01:14:39.893 --> 01:14:41.603
Like how about we call a truce?

01:14:42.146 --> 01:14:44.439
Nobody is in control. We'll just...

01:14:45.691 --> 01:14:47.609
you know, we share a little bit.

01:14:48.235 --> 01:14:49.319
Can you share?

01:14:52.156 --> 01:14:53.991
- Yeah.
- Okay, okay...

01:14:54.074 --> 01:14:55.534
Hey... share, share.

01:14:56.326 --> 01:14:57.326
Share.

01:14:59.204 --> 01:15:00.706
- Yeah, that's right.
- Okay.

01:15:29.026 --> 01:15:30.194
How was that?

01:15:32.154 --> 01:15:33.739
It was phenomenal!

01:15:34.823 --> 01:15:36.116
It was like you were in my head.

01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:37.868
You knew everything that I wanted.

01:15:38.994 --> 01:15:42.039
Girl, I feel like I just ran
half a marathon. I need some electrolytes.

01:15:42.122 --> 01:15:43.707
- You want some electrolytes?
- No...

01:15:43.790 --> 01:15:46.019
I don't smoke or nothin' after sex,
but I'm gonna get me some Gatorade.

01:15:46.043 --> 01:15:47.228
- You want some Gatorade?
- No.

01:15:47.252 --> 01:15:51.715
- I got flavours. Oh, okay. All right.
- I am good. I'm straight.

01:15:52.925 --> 01:15:57.554
<i>Ali, bomaye! Ali, bomaye!
Ali, bomaye!</i>

01:15:57.638 --> 01:15:58.639
<i>Shit, yeah.</i>

01:15:58.972 --> 01:16:01.141
<i>She the greatest of all time.
Thank you, Lord Jesus.</i>

01:16:01.225 --> 01:16:02.726
<i>- Ali, bomaye!</i>
- Yes!

01:16:09.858 --> 01:16:11.777
Will and Ben are here.
They're on their way up.

01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:12.861
I want to know something.

01:16:14.154 --> 01:16:15.739
What do you see in that gin jockey?

01:16:16.490 --> 01:16:18.825
I mean, you're successful, beautiful,

01:16:19.243 --> 01:16:21.453
and he's a single parent with no career.

01:16:21.536 --> 01:16:23.121
Did you say "gin jockey"?

01:16:23.664 --> 01:16:25.582
Yes, I said "gin jockey."

01:16:25.666 --> 01:16:27.501
He is a businessman, okay?

01:16:27.584 --> 01:16:29.795
He's saving his money
so he can open his own bar.

01:16:29.878 --> 01:16:32.756
Like your gym. Look, just please be nice.

01:16:32.839 --> 01:16:34.967
Be nice? I am nice. I'm nice as shit.

01:16:36.343 --> 01:16:38.595
"Gin jockey"?
Where do you find these things?

01:16:38.679 --> 01:16:41.181
- Come here, Dad. Hey!
- Hey.

01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:45.811
- Dad, I need you to meet Will and Ben.
- Hi.

01:16:45.894 --> 01:16:47.614
- Nice to meet you, sir.
- Welcome, welcome.

01:16:47.771 --> 01:16:49.106
<i>I'll give it three months.</i>

01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:51.692
<i>She'll chew him up and spit him out.</i>

01:16:53.485 --> 01:16:55.570
Hey, did you introduce yourself?

01:16:56.071 --> 01:16:58.365
Hi, I'm Ben. It's nice to meet you.

01:16:58.448 --> 01:16:59.449
Wait, wait, wait.

01:16:59.533 --> 01:17:03.078
So, tomorrow. Big signing day, huh?

01:17:03.161 --> 01:17:04.371
Yep.

01:17:04.454 --> 01:17:07.165
No worries about, you know,
crazy Joe changing his mind

01:17:07.249 --> 01:17:08.625
or Jamal trying to stay in school?

01:17:08.959 --> 01:17:10.895
Nah, I have a pretty good gauge
on that situation.

01:17:10.919 --> 01:17:13.714
So I think I know what's on Jamal's mind.

01:17:13.797 --> 01:17:14.797
I'm sure you do.

01:17:15.299 --> 01:17:17.968
But, you know,
knowing what's on a man's mind

01:17:18.051 --> 01:17:19.761
is not the same as what's in his heart.

01:17:19.845 --> 01:17:22.139
Well, isn't it the same thing?
To get paid and get laid?

01:17:22.222 --> 01:17:25.100
Wait. You really think
that's what men want?

01:17:25.183 --> 01:17:27.644
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow.

01:17:27.978 --> 01:17:30.022
- That's messed up.
- Well...

01:17:30.105 --> 01:17:31.815
Have you ever even trusted a man?

01:17:32.899 --> 01:17:34.026
She trusts me.

01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:36.737
Okay. Well, see...

01:17:37.904 --> 01:17:42.200
I think that men and women just want
the same thing at the end of the day.

01:17:42.951 --> 01:17:45.537
They want to be with somebody they trust.

01:17:46.204 --> 01:17:48.707
To be respected, appreciated, and...

01:17:49.499 --> 01:17:51.251
and just to feel safe.

01:17:51.668 --> 01:17:54.129
So you believe men and women
want the same thing?

01:17:54.588 --> 01:17:57.341
As a bartender,
I've learned to sit back and listen.

01:17:57.424 --> 01:17:59.926
Eventually,
you learn how people really feel.

01:18:00.844 --> 01:18:01.928
Good to know.

01:18:02.512 --> 01:18:04.973
<i>Wow, she is really beautiful.</i>

01:18:05.432 --> 01:18:07.601
So, now that we know
what men and women want,

01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:10.479
the question is what do boys want?

01:18:10.562 --> 01:18:12.773
Got any gift ideas for your birthday, Ben?

01:18:12.856 --> 01:18:14.608
My dad works real hard,

01:18:14.691 --> 01:18:16.902
so I try not to make a big deal out of it.

01:18:17.361 --> 01:18:20.113
It's mostly just
about me and him hanging out.

01:18:20.197 --> 01:18:22.240
Us, too.

01:18:24.284 --> 01:18:26.703
Do you know that Ali grew up
without a mom?

01:18:26.787 --> 01:18:28.955
<i>I think about that woman every day.</i>

01:18:29.539 --> 01:18:30.832
<i>And it still hurts.</i>

01:18:31.291 --> 01:18:35.212
You know, Ben, I imagine your dad
had to work extra hard

01:18:35.295 --> 01:18:37.089
to raise a kid as kind as you.

01:18:37.172 --> 01:18:38.215
Thank you, Skip.

01:18:39.341 --> 01:18:41.426
I think you can appreciate it
more than most.

01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:44.721
To fatherhood.

01:18:54.189 --> 01:18:55.189
You did it!

01:18:55.399 --> 01:18:58.151
- You guys day drinking? I'm in.
- Oh, hey.

01:18:58.235 --> 01:19:00.779
Yeah. Let me just grab two more glasses.
I'll be right back.

01:19:00.862 --> 01:19:03.299
Did you figure out who you're gonna draft,
Roethlisberger or Brady?

01:19:03.323 --> 01:19:04.616
I think I'm gonna go with Brady,

01:19:04.699 --> 01:19:06.952
but my friend Duncan said
he's gonna get Roethlisberger,

01:19:07.035 --> 01:19:08.787
and we can swap any time we want.

01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:11.415
<i>God, he's beautiful.
And he loves fantasy football?</i>

01:19:11.498 --> 01:19:12.624
What kind of league is that?

01:19:12.707 --> 01:19:15.001
Do you have to wear
a weird T-shirt or some shit?

01:19:15.085 --> 01:19:17.754
<i>It sounds nice.
And he plays fantasy football?</i>

01:19:18.422 --> 01:19:19.589
<i>He's perfect.</i>

01:19:19.923 --> 01:19:23.260
Hey, you know what?
Why don't you two play together?

01:19:24.094 --> 01:19:26.346
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, I... I would love that.

01:19:26.430 --> 01:19:27.639
You know, you can't pick...

01:19:27.722 --> 01:19:32.018
<i>Do you take this man to be
your lawfully wedded husband?</i>

01:19:32.102 --> 01:19:34.020
<i>He's got it all! Uh!</i>

01:19:34.104 --> 01:19:37.023
Okay, you know what?
I have to get a lot of work done

01:19:37.107 --> 01:19:38.918
before Will comes here
to take me to lunch, so...

01:19:38.942 --> 01:19:40.920
Hey, did you see?
Joe Dolla called a press conference.

01:19:40.944 --> 01:19:41.778
- What?
<i>- That's right.</i>

01:19:41.862 --> 01:19:44.781
<i>I'm telling you, when it come to him,
he look just like me.</i>

01:19:44.865 --> 01:19:46.074
<i>This is my son.</i>

01:19:46.158 --> 01:19:49.536
<i>Matter of fact, we gonna withdraw
from the NBA draft right now.</i>

01:19:49.619 --> 01:19:52.497
<i>I'ma take Jamal's gifts
to the great nation of China.</i>

01:19:52.581 --> 01:19:54.499
<i>Ni hao! Holla!</i>

01:19:54.583 --> 01:19:57.335
<i>What about all that talk
of playing for your hometown, Jamal?</i>

01:19:57.586 --> 01:19:59.796
<i>What can I say?
You know, situation changed.</i>

01:20:00.046 --> 01:20:02.048
<i>What kind of money
are the Chinese offering?</i>

01:20:02.132 --> 01:20:04.801
<i>Our new concierge agent, Ethan Fowler,</i>

01:20:04.885 --> 01:20:05.927
<i>he gonna answer that.</i>

01:20:06.011 --> 01:20:07.721
<i>- Money Man! Tell 'em wassup.
- Yep.</i>

01:20:07.804 --> 01:20:09.604
<i>Hey there, ladies and gentlemen.
Ethan Fowler.</i>

01:20:09.681 --> 01:20:12.267
<i>Our good friends in China
are currently offering</i>

01:20:12.350 --> 01:20:14.895
<i>three times the rookie NBA deal, okay?</i>

01:20:14.978 --> 01:20:17.481
<i>Does this mean you've signed
with Summit Worldwide?</i>

01:20:17.564 --> 01:20:19.149
<i>I'll actually answer that one. Uh...</i>

01:20:19.232 --> 01:20:20.775
<i>I've currently left Summit</i>

01:20:20.859 --> 01:20:24.237
<i>to focus exclusively all my time
and energy on one client.</i>

01:20:24.321 --> 01:20:26.615
<i>He cut, he sliced his rates in half.</i>

01:20:26.698 --> 01:20:27.698
<i>- Yeah, I know.
- In half!</i>

01:20:27.741 --> 01:20:30.368
<i>I mean, come on, ten percent...
that is highway robbery.</i>

01:20:36.833 --> 01:20:38.001
Everybody out.

01:20:39.044 --> 01:20:40.587
Out! Get out!

01:20:41.463 --> 01:20:44.007
Ali. You stay.

01:20:48.178 --> 01:20:51.431
Uh, I'm sure that China deal
is not closed.

01:20:51.515 --> 01:20:52.891
We can still save this.

01:20:54.935 --> 01:20:57.062
We can save this.

01:20:57.521 --> 01:20:59.981
Five-percent commission. Wow.

01:21:00.857 --> 01:21:02.817
Not only did you blow this signing,

01:21:02.901 --> 01:21:04.027
you gave Ethan the idea

01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:06.321
that could very well
fuck our business model completely.

01:21:06.404 --> 01:21:08.406
Okay, this is not all my fault.

01:21:08.490 --> 01:21:11.618
I mean, if I didn't think
I'd get crucified by all those MeToo-ers,

01:21:11.701 --> 01:21:13.328
I'd fire your ass today.

01:21:14.329 --> 01:21:17.249
Oh, so you're saying you're not firing me
because I'm a woman.

01:21:18.750 --> 01:21:20.835
No. Not just that.

01:21:22.546 --> 01:21:23.546
Oh.

01:21:24.214 --> 01:21:27.634
So, you're not firing me
because I'm a black woman.

01:21:28.051 --> 01:21:30.053
No. No, no. I didn't say that.

01:21:30.428 --> 01:21:32.347
Because that'd be racist and sexist.

01:21:32.430 --> 01:21:35.100
Hell, no. I am not your twofer.

01:21:35.183 --> 01:21:36.851
I dare you to fire me.

01:21:36.935 --> 01:21:39.312
My clients will follow me out that door.

01:21:40.021 --> 01:21:42.107
You keep on dreaming that dream.

01:21:46.152 --> 01:21:47.821
- Nick, please...
- Nope, not happening.

01:21:47.904 --> 01:21:49.072
- There she goes.
- Hey.

01:21:49.155 --> 01:21:50.591
- Hey, girl, ready for lunch?
- Yeah.

01:21:50.615 --> 01:21:52.200
I can wait downstairs if that's better.

01:21:52.284 --> 01:21:54.244
- Okay.
- Oh, great. You know what?

01:21:54.995 --> 01:21:57.205
You can stop pretending. Okay, Will?

01:21:57.289 --> 01:21:58.582
If that's even your name.

01:21:58.957 --> 01:22:02.210
Actually,
I'm glad this charade can finally end.

01:22:02.294 --> 01:22:04.838
Sorry, "charade"? What's he talking about?

01:22:04.921 --> 01:22:06.298
- Nick, please, don't...
- You two.

01:22:06.923 --> 01:22:08.383
Pretending that y'all are married

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:11.094
to impress that fucking fraud Joe Dolla!

01:22:11.761 --> 01:22:14.431
Well, you know what? It didn't work.

01:22:15.473 --> 01:22:17.017
Mr. Family Man, huh?

01:22:19.728 --> 01:22:22.105
Okay, whoo.
This is a big misunderstanding.

01:22:22.188 --> 01:22:23.188
So wait, wait, hold up.

01:22:24.399 --> 01:22:26.651
That's why you really
invited us to the game?

01:22:27.736 --> 01:22:29.904
- No.
- Not to make up for the fact

01:22:29.988 --> 01:22:33.950
that you accused me
of cheating on my dead wife with you?

01:22:34.034 --> 01:22:35.034
No.

01:22:35.410 --> 01:22:37.370
Please, it is very complicated.

01:22:37.454 --> 01:22:40.248
- Just let me talk to you alone.
- About... About what?

01:22:40.582 --> 01:22:44.669
About what? How you used my son,
my child, as a prop?

01:22:50.884 --> 01:22:51.884
Just...

01:22:52.177 --> 01:22:53.845
- Please.
- Please stay away from us.

01:22:55.013 --> 01:22:56.013
Please.

01:23:15.742 --> 01:23:18.036
These powers have ruined my life.

01:23:18.787 --> 01:23:20.455
I would like to return them.

01:23:21.039 --> 01:23:22.957
Or whatever you do with powers.

01:23:23.249 --> 01:23:24.709
Well, if I can be real,

01:23:25.418 --> 01:23:28.213
I finished off the Haitian tea,
drunk it all myself.

01:23:28.713 --> 01:23:30.590
- And...
- The only voices I heard

01:23:30.674 --> 01:23:33.426
were Joan Rivers and Tupac.

01:23:34.386 --> 01:23:36.179
And they did not get along.

01:23:36.971 --> 01:23:40.392
My God, this is a disaster.

01:23:41.559 --> 01:23:44.854
Mm.
Maybe you looking at it the wrong way.

01:23:46.648 --> 01:23:49.943
With power comes a responsibility
to tell the truth.

01:23:50.819 --> 01:23:52.445
Have you been telling the truth?

01:23:53.863 --> 01:23:55.448
You need to let the spirit guide you.

01:24:08.795 --> 01:24:10.588
- The spirit.
- Yeah.

01:24:18.471 --> 01:24:19.723
Spirit.

01:24:27.731 --> 01:24:31.025
Yikes. Hey, maybe we, uh, take it
easy on the drinky-drink there.

01:24:31.109 --> 01:24:33.029
Ceremony's about to start
and you're in it, okay?

01:24:33.111 --> 01:24:35.321
No, no, no. I need a cranberry vodka

01:24:35.405 --> 01:24:37.490
because I'm feeling the spirit, Brandon.

01:24:37.574 --> 01:24:39.909
- Uh-huh.
- I have words, they need saying.

01:24:40.493 --> 01:24:43.955
As a matter of fact, everybody in here

01:24:44.038 --> 01:24:46.958
needs a big, steaming mug of hot tea.

01:24:47.041 --> 01:24:50.211
Oh, or maybe everybody
just sticks with water, you know...

01:24:50.295 --> 01:24:52.857
No. No, no, no. How about you go
get that vodka cran like I said, baby.

01:24:52.881 --> 01:24:54.883
- Uh-huh.
- Trusty assistant. Go.

01:24:55.467 --> 01:24:56.301
Hm.

01:24:56.384 --> 01:24:59.471
And Christ said,
"A man shall leave his mother and father

01:24:59.554 --> 01:25:01.139
and cleave to his wife,

01:25:02.098 --> 01:25:03.767
so that they are no more twain..."

01:25:03.850 --> 01:25:06.853
<i>Check out that tasty
Oreo bridesmaid sandwich.</i>

01:25:06.936 --> 01:25:09.355
<i>I can't believe how long
this Viagra's lasting!</i>

01:25:09.439 --> 01:25:11.441
<i>Can't believe I'm missing the game
for this shit.</i>

01:25:11.524 --> 01:25:12.710
<i>Did I leave my keys on my desk?</i>

01:25:12.734 --> 01:25:15.737
<i>♪ Cotton-eyed Joe
I'd been married a long time ago ♪</i>

01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:17.339
<i>♪ Where did you come from?
Where did you go? ♪</i>

01:25:17.363 --> 01:25:19.824
<i>Oh, man.
This suit's giving me a swamp ass.</i>

01:25:19.908 --> 01:25:21.268
<i>I love the word "Toledo."
To-le-do.</i>

01:25:21.326 --> 01:25:22.887
<i>Can't believe I said "I love you"

01:25:22.911 --> 01:25:24.388
<i>Look at Gabby's tits
just hanging out.</i>

01:25:24.412 --> 01:25:27.665
<i>Haven't tapped that fine ass
since Mari was in Boston last May.</i>

01:25:28.082 --> 01:25:29.722
<i>Might need to get that again soon though.</i>

01:25:29.793 --> 01:25:33.046
Ladies and gentlemen, the bride and groom
have written their own vows.

01:25:33.129 --> 01:25:34.589
- James?
- Yes, sir.

01:25:35.548 --> 01:25:38.051
When I met you on that sun-dappled
June afternoon

01:25:38.134 --> 01:25:39.570
- at the Waffle House...
- He said, "dappled".

01:25:39.594 --> 01:25:42.305
...and you put that whole bottle
of hot sauce on your two-piece...

01:25:43.306 --> 01:25:45.517
I knew right then
there'd never be another woman for me.

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:47.519
Oh, God. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

01:25:47.602 --> 01:25:50.563
- I'm so, so sorry.
- What the hell?

01:25:50.647 --> 01:25:52.982
I... have something I gotta say.

01:25:53.066 --> 01:25:54.442
What are you doing?

01:25:54.526 --> 01:25:57.362
Girl, I am letting the spirit move me.

01:25:57.695 --> 01:25:58.695
Huh?

01:26:00.406 --> 01:26:01.574
I...

01:26:03.117 --> 01:26:04.536
I've been given a gift.

01:26:05.078 --> 01:26:06.621
Possibly by God.

01:26:06.704 --> 01:26:11.125
Possibly by a low-rent, hair-styling,
weed-dealing psychic. But...

01:26:12.001 --> 01:26:14.295
I can hear men's thoughts.

01:26:15.839 --> 01:26:18.925
Ali, why don't you just come
sit down here with me for a minute?

01:26:19.008 --> 01:26:20.093
Uh, Brandon, back up.

01:26:20.635 --> 01:26:21.635
Back up.

01:26:21.803 --> 01:26:23.304
I'm just saying, as your friend...

01:26:23.388 --> 01:26:26.015
You... are not my friend.

01:26:26.099 --> 01:26:28.393
You are my assistant, though.

01:26:28.810 --> 01:26:30.562
And right now you're not assisting me,

01:26:30.645 --> 01:26:33.439
you're interrupting my message!

01:26:33.523 --> 01:26:36.025
So I need you to sit down
and shut the fuck up!

01:26:37.527 --> 01:26:38.527
Hallelujah.

01:26:41.197 --> 01:26:42.198
You're on your own.

01:26:43.241 --> 01:26:44.158
Excuse me.

01:26:44.242 --> 01:26:45.285
Thank... Thank you.

01:26:45.618 --> 01:26:47.620
- Thank you for sharing that with us.
- And...

01:26:48.872 --> 01:26:50.331
because of my gift,

01:26:51.082 --> 01:26:54.878
James, I know you are not worthy
of my friend, Mari.

01:26:54.961 --> 01:26:56.087
What are you talking about?

01:26:56.170 --> 01:26:58.548
And you need to know,
before you jump the broom,

01:26:58.631 --> 01:27:01.134
that he slept with your cousin Gabby
last May.

01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:04.721
- What?
- While you were in Boston, girl.

01:27:04.804 --> 01:27:07.181
That... That never happened.
That never, never happened.

01:27:07.265 --> 01:27:09.893
I am so sorry, Mari.
He said you were on a break.

01:27:12.478 --> 01:27:13.563
Is this true?

01:27:14.272 --> 01:27:15.398
Everybody lying right now.

01:27:16.024 --> 01:27:19.444
- Mari!
- Whoo! He deserved that! Amen!

01:27:19.819 --> 01:27:21.696
- Bring it over here.
- Oh! Baby, hold on.

01:27:21.779 --> 01:27:24.574
Ali, cut it out.
This is not the time or the place.

01:27:24.657 --> 01:27:28.703
Well, Ciarra, you have problems
in your own house.

01:27:28.786 --> 01:27:31.456
Don't throw no stones,
living in a glass house.

01:27:31.873 --> 01:27:35.543
Excuse me? My house is fine.
In fact, it's locked down.

01:27:35.627 --> 01:27:38.546
Okay? I think you're just a little jealous

01:27:38.630 --> 01:27:40.381
because we're all married.

01:27:40.465 --> 01:27:42.133
I have always felt that way.

01:27:42.216 --> 01:27:45.011
- Are you ser... Really?
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

01:27:45.929 --> 01:27:47.680
So look at yourself.

01:27:47.764 --> 01:27:50.391
Well, your husband has been
getting his thing sucked,

01:27:50.725 --> 01:27:53.436
on the down-low, by his golf buddy Louis.

01:27:53.519 --> 01:27:54.896
I have always felt that way.

01:27:54.979 --> 01:27:56.356
- He what?
- You've lost your mind.

01:27:56.439 --> 01:27:58.149
I would never. That's disgusting!

01:27:58.608 --> 01:28:00.985
It wasn't when you were
sucking on my dick!

01:28:01.069 --> 01:28:02.820
Oh, Lord, not in the church!

01:28:02.904 --> 01:28:04.405
Hallelujah! A testimony!

01:28:04.489 --> 01:28:06.532
You kissed me with dick on your lips?

01:28:06.616 --> 01:28:07.825
- Oh, hell, no!
- Whoo!

01:28:13.957 --> 01:28:15.500
That's my brother. Hold Terence.

01:28:16.084 --> 01:28:17.084
Oh, no!

01:28:18.336 --> 01:28:20.171
- Oh, yeah!
- Everyone...

01:28:20.254 --> 01:28:21.482
Don't you take that! Don't you...

01:28:21.506 --> 01:28:22.506
Oh, yeah!

01:28:22.548 --> 01:28:24.175
- Oh, really?
- My hair!

01:28:28.763 --> 01:28:31.099
- Eat it! Eat the wig!
- Just grow up.

01:28:33.101 --> 01:28:34.143
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

01:28:34.227 --> 01:28:35.227
Bitch!

01:28:37.188 --> 01:28:38.272
Stay back!

01:28:40.984 --> 01:28:42.110
Oh, oh.

01:28:46.072 --> 01:28:48.741
Well, hello. Welcome back.

01:28:51.035 --> 01:28:52.035
I'd just like to say...

01:28:53.079 --> 01:28:55.957
since your last visit, I went to detox

01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:57.667
and I got my life back on track.

01:28:58.084 --> 01:28:59.210
So, thank you.

01:29:04.215 --> 01:29:05.215
That's it?

01:29:06.009 --> 01:29:07.051
That's what?

01:29:09.095 --> 01:29:10.221
I don't hear anything.

01:29:11.431 --> 01:29:12.473
No sound?

01:29:13.099 --> 01:29:15.476
- No sound?
- No, no, no, I hear that. I just...

01:29:17.437 --> 01:29:19.355
I... I don't hear your inner thoughts.

01:29:20.148 --> 01:29:21.858
That's a good thing, trust me.

01:29:24.861 --> 01:29:27.238
Okay, so, um, great, I guess I can go.

01:29:27.321 --> 01:29:29.532
- Ah, well...
- Where my peeps at?

01:29:30.241 --> 01:29:31.993
Ali, you can leave anytime,

01:29:32.076 --> 01:29:34.495
but, um, there's no one here for you.

01:29:36.956 --> 01:29:38.166
Oh.

01:29:42.336 --> 01:29:44.088
Guess I'll get myself home.

01:29:58.561 --> 01:30:00.313
- <i>So let's just stay in...
- You hear me?</i>

01:30:00.396 --> 01:30:01.981
<i>- ...your lane.
- You got you.</i>

01:30:02.065 --> 01:30:05.359
<i>About what, how you used
my son, my child, as a prop?</i>

01:30:05.443 --> 01:30:07.653
<i>We share a little bit.
Can you share?</i>

01:30:07.737 --> 01:30:08.977
<i>I believe
you are a good person.</i>

01:30:09.030 --> 01:30:10.257
<i>It's not like you have
a lot of friends here.</i>

01:30:10.281 --> 01:30:11.383
<i>Work hard, play hard, right?</i>

01:30:11.407 --> 01:30:14.786
<i>Constantly throwing the first
punch, and you got you and no one else.</i>

01:30:15.620 --> 01:30:17.371
<i>That bartender get back to you yet?</i>

01:30:19.707 --> 01:30:20.875
No.

01:30:21.959 --> 01:30:24.962
And I don't blame him, the shit I pulled.

01:30:26.631 --> 01:30:29.092
I just wanted to win, you know?

01:30:30.593 --> 01:30:32.220
I let it get away from me.

01:30:32.970 --> 01:30:36.099
No, no, no. That's on me.

01:30:38.768 --> 01:30:42.313
When your mom took off,
I didn't trust anyone.

01:30:43.689 --> 01:30:46.943
And... I put that all on you.

01:30:48.903 --> 01:30:50.071
I'm sorry if I...

01:30:51.405 --> 01:30:53.116
taught you some wrong lessons.

01:30:53.199 --> 01:30:57.328
I wanted you to toughen up,
because I was so scared.

01:30:58.996 --> 01:31:00.790
I didn't want you to be scared, too.

01:31:01.791 --> 01:31:02.791
Dad...

01:31:03.376 --> 01:31:04.919
you did an amazing job.

01:31:05.753 --> 01:31:07.922
An excellent job.

01:31:09.549 --> 01:31:12.635
No. This is all on me, okay?

01:31:13.136 --> 01:31:14.720
I messed everything up.

01:31:15.138 --> 01:31:17.807
And now I got to put
my big-girl drawers on and fix it.

01:31:21.561 --> 01:31:25.022
You know, there's things
that we probably need to learn.

01:31:25.606 --> 01:31:27.775
When to lower our fist.

01:31:28.151 --> 01:31:30.611
There's so many beautiful things that...

01:31:31.529 --> 01:31:33.990
we don't see because our hands are...

01:31:34.991 --> 01:31:36.742
in front of our face.

01:31:42.957 --> 01:31:43.957
Thanks, Dad.

01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:49.172
You're the best.

01:31:54.051 --> 01:31:56.637
You know, I don't really need
to check with Ali on that one.

01:31:56.721 --> 01:32:00.183
Serena Williams is not gonna do
local TV ads for a mattress store.

01:32:00.266 --> 01:32:02.059
But thank you for your interests.

01:32:04.353 --> 01:32:05.353
You're here.

01:32:06.189 --> 01:32:08.649
Yeah. Danny said it would be better
to look for work

01:32:08.733 --> 01:32:09.901
while I still have a job.

01:32:09.984 --> 01:32:11.444
So, I'm looking for work.

01:32:11.527 --> 01:32:13.362
Which I'm sure you already heard.

01:32:13.446 --> 01:32:15.656
I don't have the power anymore.

01:32:16.574 --> 01:32:18.409
I can't hear men's voices.

01:32:21.037 --> 01:32:23.748
So, I just told you all of that
for no reason.

01:32:24.457 --> 01:32:27.043
Wow, I just cannot win.

01:32:27.543 --> 01:32:30.171
Hey! Still the best part of my day.

01:32:36.219 --> 01:32:37.595
Wait, are you two...

01:32:37.678 --> 01:32:39.055
Playing fantasy football together?

01:32:39.138 --> 01:32:40.138
Yes, we are.

01:32:41.766 --> 01:32:43.976
That's great.

01:32:47.563 --> 01:32:49.482
Can I talk to you in my office?

01:32:51.234 --> 01:32:52.276
Please?

01:32:53.110 --> 01:32:54.445
Have a seat.

01:32:58.532 --> 01:32:59.909
Listen, Brandon.

01:33:00.743 --> 01:33:02.411
I'm sorry about that bullshit

01:33:02.495 --> 01:33:05.539
about you not being cut out
to be an agent.

01:33:06.749 --> 01:33:09.126
I would've told you anything
to keep you on my desk,

01:33:09.210 --> 01:33:10.461
because I needed you.

01:33:13.589 --> 01:33:16.008
And you're a better friend than I deserve.

01:33:21.013 --> 01:33:22.807
You... That's... You're apologising.

01:33:22.890 --> 01:33:23.890
Yes.

01:33:24.725 --> 01:33:26.269
- To me.
- Mm-hmm.

01:33:26.852 --> 01:33:27.852
Wow.

01:33:28.854 --> 01:33:30.273
I did not see that coming.

01:33:31.524 --> 01:33:35.027
It's not a promotion or a raise,
but it is definitely something.

01:33:35.111 --> 01:33:37.530
Okay, well,
you get a raise effective today.

01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:40.616
And will until you find something better.

01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:42.618
And a promotion, TBD.

01:33:43.828 --> 01:33:45.955
I don't even know if I still work here.

01:33:46.539 --> 01:33:47.581
Have you heard anything?

01:33:50.584 --> 01:33:51.877
Well, thank you.

01:33:57.383 --> 01:34:01.304
Oh, God, I just wish
I had gotten out of my own head

01:34:02.138 --> 01:34:06.142
and gotten to know Jamal
instead of try to sell him.

01:34:06.809 --> 01:34:09.353
I just wish I'd listened to him.

01:34:30.082 --> 01:34:32.835
All right, you have got to be psychic
or something.

01:34:33.794 --> 01:34:34.794
What you got over there?

01:34:34.837 --> 01:34:38.632
Um, just a little Chinese food
to celebrate your success.

01:34:39.842 --> 01:34:41.642
Well, I guess I'll be
eating a lot of it then.

01:34:41.719 --> 01:34:42.762
You happy?

01:34:44.597 --> 01:34:45.598
What do you think?

01:34:48.893 --> 01:34:49.977
Let me see that.

01:34:52.063 --> 01:34:53.314
I don't know.

01:34:53.397 --> 01:34:55.066
I'm not even gonna pretend to know.

01:34:57.651 --> 01:34:59.653
- Whoo-hoo!
- Okay. Look at you.

01:34:59.737 --> 01:35:02.656
What can I say?
My dad wanted a boy.

01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:05.117
Yeah, well, you don't even
have to tell me about dads.

01:35:05.451 --> 01:35:07.161
You know, mine is, uh, unique.

01:35:07.578 --> 01:35:08.746
That is very true.

01:35:15.961 --> 01:35:18.005
Dad took me out to this court
when I was five.

01:35:19.382 --> 01:35:23.010
And he would not let me leave
until I sank three in a row.

01:35:23.636 --> 01:35:24.720
And it got us here.

01:35:25.262 --> 01:35:26.430
I know it sounds corny,

01:35:26.514 --> 01:35:29.475
but I want to win a championship
and celebrate here.

01:35:30.226 --> 01:35:31.685
With the people I grew up with.

01:35:32.853 --> 01:35:33.771
That's my dream.

01:35:33.854 --> 01:35:34.897
I get it.

01:35:38.901 --> 01:35:39.985
Give me that.

01:35:41.487 --> 01:35:43.327
You're gonna have a lot
of people coming at you

01:35:43.406 --> 01:35:45.533
with all sorts of advice from here on out.

01:35:45.616 --> 01:35:46.450
You know that, right?

01:35:46.534 --> 01:35:48.577
Right. But you're the one
I should listen to, right?

01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:53.791
No. The only person
you should listen to is you.

01:35:55.126 --> 01:35:58.129
Because you're the only person
who knows what you really want.

01:35:58.963 --> 01:36:01.507
Forget your head. What's in your heart?

01:36:07.012 --> 01:36:09.390
Just fuck him. I'm done.

01:36:10.015 --> 01:36:13.686
I always sensed that he was
a skeezy motherfucker.

01:36:13.769 --> 01:36:15.609
But you know what?
I was on that marriage train

01:36:15.688 --> 01:36:16.856
and I didn't want to get off.

01:36:16.939 --> 01:36:18.149
Just fucking stupid.

01:36:18.232 --> 01:36:21.110
When that woman leaped onto the stage

01:36:21.193 --> 01:36:22.778
and ripped out your hair...

01:36:23.821 --> 01:36:26.115
I almost put down my phone
and said something.

01:36:26.198 --> 01:36:29.243
- How is that helping us?
- Not... Oh, twelve o'clock.

01:36:30.119 --> 01:36:30.995
Hi.

01:36:31.078 --> 01:36:34.498
- No. No.
- No. No. No.

01:36:34.957 --> 01:36:36.709
Nope, nope, nope, nope.

01:36:36.792 --> 01:36:38.627
Let them grieve.

01:36:40.004 --> 01:36:44.049
You know, by the grace of God,
my marriage is still intact.

01:36:44.133 --> 01:36:45.885
It was stronger than theirs to begin with.

01:36:45.968 --> 01:36:48.637
But it is still intact,
because my husband wasn't there.

01:36:48.721 --> 01:36:49.823
- What the fuck?
- All right?

01:36:49.847 --> 01:36:53.017
But I am devastated for the two of them.
Devastated.

01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:55.436
- You ruined their lives!
- Um, look, I'm...

01:36:57.646 --> 01:37:00.024
I know you guys probably hate me
for what I pulled.

01:37:00.107 --> 01:37:02.568
I am so sorry, okay?

01:37:03.027 --> 01:37:04.862
I really want to make it up to you.

01:37:05.529 --> 01:37:08.532
Look, I did what I did
because I love you, okay?

01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:10.993
Not because I'm jealous.

01:37:11.076 --> 01:37:12.495
I want what's best for all of you,

01:37:12.578 --> 01:37:14.330
and I'm not gonna let you marry a skeezer

01:37:14.413 --> 01:37:17.253
and I'm not gonna stand by and not
tell you about your down-low husband.

01:37:17.333 --> 01:37:19.418
I'm sorry. I'm a friend, not an enabler.

01:37:19.710 --> 01:37:22.963
That was some freaky-ass shit you pulled.

01:37:23.047 --> 01:37:25.007
You could hear men's thoughts.

01:37:25.633 --> 01:37:27.718
And you didn't tell us, your girls?

01:37:27.801 --> 01:37:29.821
- Yeah, what the fuck?
- We should've been the first to know.

01:37:29.845 --> 01:37:31.096
We could've helped you out!

01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:32.580
- That's good information.
- Look...

01:37:33.307 --> 01:37:35.100
I know I've been a shitty friend.

01:37:35.184 --> 01:37:36.268
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes.

01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:37.686
- Very shitty.
- Terrible.

01:37:37.770 --> 01:37:38.854
Very shitty friend.

01:37:38.938 --> 01:37:40.648
And that is Jesus speaking through me.

01:37:40.731 --> 01:37:43.567
I mean, like skid-mark-
in-the-drawers shitty-ass friend.

01:37:43.651 --> 01:37:46.904
I'm about to write poetry about it,
just to express my rage.

01:37:46.987 --> 01:37:48.072
Well, that's a good thing.

01:37:48.155 --> 01:37:50.282
- Boo-Boo Shitty Kitty.
- Shit on top of shit.

01:37:50.366 --> 01:37:51.742
- Sorry.
- One star on Yelp.

01:37:51.825 --> 01:37:53.178
- Shitty Shitty Bang Bang Ali.
- "Knock, knock."

01:37:53.202 --> 01:37:55.347
- "Who's there?" "Ali, and I'm shitty."
- The shitty friend.

01:37:55.371 --> 01:37:58.374
- Yeah, the shitty friend.
- Okay. All right, I deserve that.

01:37:58.707 --> 01:38:00.376
I deserve it all.

01:38:01.043 --> 01:38:03.379
But I want to make that up
to you too, okay?

01:38:03.462 --> 01:38:07.925
I promise to prioritise my life better.

01:38:08.217 --> 01:38:11.554
You mean more to me,
and I should treat you as such.

01:38:11.637 --> 01:38:15.182
Because I really do love you
and I need you in my life, okay?

01:38:21.689 --> 01:38:25.067
All right. Margarita Mondays on me. Shit.

01:38:28.028 --> 01:38:29.028
Forever?

01:38:30.823 --> 01:38:31.740
Mm-hmm.

01:38:31.824 --> 01:38:33.993
- I'm about to get fired.
- I don't care.

01:38:34.076 --> 01:38:36.161
I say if she wants
to pay for Margarita Mondays,

01:38:36.245 --> 01:38:37.288
let's let her do it.

01:38:37.371 --> 01:38:39.011
That's my cheat day and you're gonna pay.

01:38:39.081 --> 01:38:40.124
- Okay.
- You will pay.

01:38:40.207 --> 01:38:42.042
- Thank you.
- Okay, let's toast.

01:38:42.126 --> 01:38:43.436
- We need to make a toast.
- Give it to her!

01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:45.337
We need to make a toast, come on.

01:38:45.421 --> 01:38:47.221
We'll toast, we'll toast.
We'll get some more.

01:38:47.298 --> 01:38:50.175
To my three best friends.

01:38:50.593 --> 01:38:51.719
- Yes!
- Cheers!

01:38:56.432 --> 01:38:59.476
<i>This is the 2018 NBA Draft,</i>

01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:03.397
<i>and commissioner Adam Silver is
about to step to the microphone.</i>

01:39:09.445 --> 01:39:12.114
Good evening,
and welcome to the NBA Draft.

01:39:12.698 --> 01:39:16.243
These young men here tonight
represent the future of our sport.

01:39:16.785 --> 01:39:20.372
With the first pick in the 2018 NBA Draft,

01:39:20.456 --> 01:39:21.832
the Atlanta Hawks select...

01:39:23.125 --> 01:39:26.795
Jamal Barry from Georgia Tech.

01:39:29.340 --> 01:39:31.925
- Thanks for making this happen.
- So proud of you.

01:39:54.365 --> 01:39:56.075
Hey, hey, there she is!

01:39:56.450 --> 01:39:58.452
The worst thing to happen
to US-China relations

01:39:58.535 --> 01:40:01.121
since Richard Nixon shot and ate a panda.

01:40:02.790 --> 01:40:06.210
Joe, I really want you on my team, okay?

01:40:07.086 --> 01:40:08.754
How about we work together

01:40:08.837 --> 01:40:12.424
to make sure Jamal has an amazing career.

01:40:12.508 --> 01:40:13.508
How about that?

01:40:16.011 --> 01:40:18.013
- I like you.
- Thanks.

01:40:18.097 --> 01:40:21.517
- See Jamal? That's my dude.
- Mm-hmm.

01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:22.851
And you know dudes.

01:40:24.603 --> 01:40:27.106
Well, that's the first time
I've heard that.

01:40:31.527 --> 01:40:34.071
<i>Well, first order of business.</i>

01:40:34.697 --> 01:40:38.075
I guess we can all see that
Ethan has re-joined the team.

01:40:38.534 --> 01:40:41.245
And we have dropped our lawsuit
accordingly.

01:40:41.328 --> 01:40:43.372
Listen, guys,
that unfortunate China incident

01:40:43.455 --> 01:40:47.459
was brought on, if you can believe it,
by clear braces. Uh...

01:40:48.168 --> 01:40:52.506
Excessive salivation led to
dehydration, exhaustion, and stress.

01:40:52.589 --> 01:40:54.633
You know. But I'm great now.

01:40:54.717 --> 01:40:55.718
Happy to be back.

01:40:55.801 --> 01:40:57.511
Ethan's no longer a partner.

01:40:57.594 --> 01:41:00.013
And he'll be subject
to a yearly probationary review.

01:41:01.306 --> 01:41:02.725
Now, with that being said,

01:41:03.058 --> 01:41:06.061
seems like we have
a partner slot that has opened.

01:41:07.312 --> 01:41:09.565
Or shall I say... "had."

01:41:12.401 --> 01:41:14.862
I think we all know what this is.

01:41:15.529 --> 01:41:18.240
And I think we all know who deserves it.

01:41:19.241 --> 01:41:20.841
Let's give it up for our newest partner:

01:41:21.326 --> 01:41:22.703
Ali Davis.

01:41:42.556 --> 01:41:44.975
Wow. Thanks. Thanks.

01:41:45.601 --> 01:41:47.227
Thanks so much, Nick.

01:41:50.481 --> 01:41:52.983
For so many years, all I ever wanted

01:41:53.066 --> 01:41:56.195
was to be a part of this boys club.

01:41:56.653 --> 01:41:57.821
It's all I ever wanted.

01:42:03.619 --> 01:42:04.828
And...

01:42:07.289 --> 01:42:11.043
I don't want to be
a part of your club anymore.

01:42:13.504 --> 01:42:16.924
No, from now on, my self-worth

01:42:17.758 --> 01:42:21.053
is not going to come
from a man's approval.

01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:24.680
No.

01:42:26.308 --> 01:42:28.977
I am going to compete and win

01:42:29.061 --> 01:42:31.563
on my own terms, not yours.

01:42:32.105 --> 01:42:35.526
So, I'm opening my own agency.

01:42:37.903 --> 01:42:39.321
I'm sorry, what's happening here?

01:42:39.404 --> 01:42:41.406
Oh, calm down, Nick. Have a Fiji.

01:42:41.490 --> 01:42:43.408
I will come after your clients hard!

01:42:43.492 --> 01:42:44.618
Calm your nuts!

01:42:44.701 --> 01:42:48.372
Look, you do very well in your lane, Nick.
So, stay in it.

01:42:48.455 --> 01:42:52.000
Oh, and, uh, my partner is going to be...

01:42:52.084 --> 01:42:53.084
Uh!

01:42:54.837 --> 01:42:57.756
What? Wait, bro. No way!

01:42:59.132 --> 01:42:59.967
I'm with her.

01:43:00.050 --> 01:43:02.719
Okay, so on that note, we're out.

01:43:02.803 --> 01:43:05.848
Um, and we would like to wish you the best

01:43:05.931 --> 01:43:07.766
in all of your future endeavours,

01:43:07.850 --> 01:43:09.226
i.e., go fuck yourself.

01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:11.311
And kiss my black ass.

01:43:11.395 --> 01:43:12.396
Let's go.

01:43:12.479 --> 01:43:13.479
Hey, Nick.

01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:17.860
Oh, there's one more box
at the front desk.

01:43:17.943 --> 01:43:19.069
I'm gonna go grab it.

01:43:19.695 --> 01:43:20.695
Okay.

01:43:23.073 --> 01:43:25.617
The two of you are so cute together,
it's sickening.

01:43:26.535 --> 01:43:28.704
Well, it's all thanks to you.

01:43:28.787 --> 01:43:31.790
And I guess a little bit thanks
to that weird Sister lady.

01:43:32.165 --> 01:43:34.543
Okay. Uh, so, all I need to know now
is where you'd like me

01:43:34.626 --> 01:43:36.587
to make a reservation
for you and the other agents

01:43:36.670 --> 01:43:37.713
to celebrate the new firm.

01:43:37.796 --> 01:43:40.883
I took care of that. I made reservations
for three at Pricci at 8:00.

01:43:40.966 --> 01:43:42.801
- You made a reservation?
- Mm-hmm.

01:43:42.885 --> 01:43:44.761
So, you, Kevin, who's the third?

01:43:45.262 --> 01:43:46.179
Oh, um...

01:43:46.263 --> 01:43:47.472
Our new agent.

01:43:47.973 --> 01:43:49.850
Um, you actually know this guy.

01:43:50.142 --> 01:43:52.769
He's cute, he's short,
about your height, wears your glasses.

01:43:53.312 --> 01:43:56.106
Yeah, he's gonna make
one hell of an agent.

01:43:56.815 --> 01:43:59.151
I'm gonna be a... You're making me a...

01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:02.487
I'm just gonna take a second
and try to read your mind

01:44:02.571 --> 01:44:05.699
and see if you're fucking with me,
which would be unbelievably cruel. But...

01:44:06.158 --> 01:44:07.969
I think you're being serious.
Is this for real?

01:44:07.993 --> 01:44:09.369
Yes, and it's long overdue.

01:44:11.038 --> 01:44:12.838
Permission to pick you up
and spin you around?

01:44:12.915 --> 01:44:14.541
I think I'm gonna regret this, but okay.

01:44:14.625 --> 01:44:16.752
Ah! Thank you so much!
Thank you, thank you!

01:44:16.835 --> 01:44:18.515
Okay, wait a minute! Hold on! Put me down.

01:44:19.171 --> 01:44:20.422
Listen, listen, listen.

01:44:20.756 --> 01:44:23.592
- Agents don't speak in that high tone.
- Hey!

01:44:23.675 --> 01:44:25.636
Hey, what'd I miss? What happened?

01:44:26.261 --> 01:44:28.013
- Ali's making me an agent.
- Yeah.

01:44:29.014 --> 01:44:30.140
That's so hot, bro.

01:44:30.974 --> 01:44:32.309
- Stop!
- Oh!

01:44:33.727 --> 01:44:36.396
Oh, my God. Congrats.

01:44:40.484 --> 01:44:41.693
Yeah, that's what's up.

01:44:42.778 --> 01:44:44.404
- Yeah.
- Feel me. That's what's up, man.

01:44:44.696 --> 01:44:45.696
Dope!

01:44:46.031 --> 01:44:47.616
Ooh, yes! Damn.

01:44:47.699 --> 01:44:48.784
That's what's up.

01:44:50.827 --> 01:44:52.454
All right, who wants more cupcakes?

01:44:52.537 --> 01:44:54.039
Me! Me! Me!

01:44:54.122 --> 01:44:56.083
Wait, wait, wait. One at a time.

01:44:57.376 --> 01:44:59.586
Um, uh... Bridget, would you...

01:45:01.922 --> 01:45:03.966
Birthday cake delivery for Ben.

01:45:04.049 --> 01:45:06.635
- Ali, you remembered.
- Yes.

01:45:06.718 --> 01:45:09.429
- That's a sports Turbo S.
- It is.

01:45:09.513 --> 01:45:12.307
Maybe you can take a ride
in a real one someday.

01:45:12.557 --> 01:45:14.559
Uh, Shonda, would you mind taking the...

01:45:15.644 --> 01:45:17.771
- Good to see you.
- Come with me, Ben.

01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:23.110
Come on, kids. Cake outside.

01:45:23.860 --> 01:45:24.861
Can we talk?

01:45:30.117 --> 01:45:32.160
I'm so sorry to show up
unannounced like this,

01:45:32.244 --> 01:45:35.330
but I promised Ben a birthday cake

01:45:35.414 --> 01:45:37.332
and I wanted to honour that promise.

01:45:42.504 --> 01:45:43.964
And now I'll go.

01:45:45.674 --> 01:45:46.717
Thank you.

01:45:47.926 --> 01:45:51.471
But you do know that one grand gesture
doesn't just rewrite history.

01:45:56.018 --> 01:45:57.561
Will, that night I met you...

01:45:58.979 --> 01:46:01.982
I was afraid that everything that I wanted

01:46:02.065 --> 01:46:03.608
was being taken from me.

01:46:05.861 --> 01:46:06.945
I've been there.

01:46:08.363 --> 01:46:11.700
I was angry, and I disrespected you,
and that was wrong.

01:46:14.077 --> 01:46:15.662
You see, I never...

01:46:16.079 --> 01:46:18.874
considered what a man wants
or how he feels,

01:46:18.957 --> 01:46:20.500
just as long as I won.

01:46:21.251 --> 01:46:22.878
But what I've learned is that...

01:46:23.462 --> 01:46:26.798
winning really doesn't matter
if you're a horrible person.

01:46:27.799 --> 01:46:29.176
And you taught me that.

01:46:30.385 --> 01:46:32.763
And I want to thank you
from the bottom of my heart.

01:46:35.807 --> 01:46:36.808
Cool.

01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:39.394
Cool.

01:46:39.478 --> 01:46:41.772
Look, I know a lot has changed,

01:46:42.105 --> 01:46:43.190
and so fast,

01:46:43.857 --> 01:46:47.402
but, um... I would really like
a second chance.

01:46:47.486 --> 01:46:49.404
And I understand if you say no.

01:46:53.492 --> 01:46:56.119
- It's your third chance.
- Third? Oh, third.

01:46:56.203 --> 01:46:57.871
It's... it's your third chance.

01:46:57.954 --> 01:47:01.666
Shit, third. Okay, well...

01:47:01.750 --> 01:47:03.668
I like to believe three's a charm.

01:47:04.628 --> 01:47:06.379
But I totally respect...

01:47:07.839 --> 01:47:09.382
- your decision.
- I, uh...

01:47:18.642 --> 01:47:19.810
Okay. Okay.

01:47:19.893 --> 01:47:21.436
But on one condition.

01:47:22.187 --> 01:47:24.106
Look, I need to know
everything you're thinking.

01:47:24.189 --> 01:47:25.565
- Everything. The truth.
- Oh!

01:47:25.649 --> 01:47:26.983
No matter how hard.

01:47:29.194 --> 01:47:30.278
Negotiation.

01:47:30.987 --> 01:47:32.948
That's something I promise you
I'm really good at.

01:47:33.031 --> 01:47:35.158
Oh, don't you worry.
You ain't getting off easy.

01:47:36.201 --> 01:47:37.619
Oh, you're not.

01:47:38.161 --> 01:47:40.372
I'm taking Ben to the park after this.
Hang out.

01:47:45.877 --> 01:47:48.839
When you were my age,
what did you want to be?

01:47:48.922 --> 01:47:51.800
Mm, I wanted to be a boxer,
believe it or not.

01:47:52.384 --> 01:47:54.469
Interesting.

01:47:56.721 --> 01:47:58.223
Which do you like better,

01:47:58.306 --> 01:48:00.976
Porsche Turbo S or a used Subaru?

01:48:01.268 --> 01:48:04.062
Uh, I would have to say a Porsche.

01:48:04.146 --> 01:48:07.065
- Well, at least until my lease is up.
- Uh-huh.

01:48:07.149 --> 01:48:08.316
- Makes sense.
- Yeah.

01:48:10.235 --> 01:48:12.904
So, what are you thinking
of calling your new agency?

01:48:12.988 --> 01:48:15.866
I'm thinking
Davis Athletics Management.

01:48:15.949 --> 01:48:18.827
You do know,
abbreviated, that's DAM.

01:48:18.910 --> 01:48:20.495
Like D-A-M. DAM.

01:48:20.871 --> 01:48:22.706
- That's right.
- So you do know.

01:48:22.998 --> 01:48:25.375
When people call,
I want the receptionist to say,

01:48:25.458 --> 01:48:27.169
"DAM. How can I help you?"

01:48:27.586 --> 01:48:29.921
- Aw, shit.
- No, that's "Aw, DAM."

01:49:01.328 --> 01:49:02.370
Hold this with me.

01:49:02.704 --> 01:49:04.080
Someone else is here with us.

01:49:04.164 --> 01:49:05.415
Who is it?

01:49:05.749 --> 01:49:07.209
- Mari.
- Yeah?

01:49:08.043 --> 01:49:09.211
Mari, it's me.

01:49:09.294 --> 01:49:10.295
Who is it?

01:49:10.670 --> 01:49:12.047
Why did you do this to me, Mari?

01:49:12.130 --> 01:49:14.758
Why didn't you mind your own
fucking business, Mari?

01:49:14.841 --> 01:49:18.011
You put me behind bars
and I killed myself, Mari!

01:49:18.094 --> 01:49:20.222
- Oh, shit.
- You're a fucking bitch, and I hate you!

01:49:20.305 --> 01:49:22.390
Mm. Mm.

01:49:22.807 --> 01:49:24.517
You're having some difficulties.

01:49:24.601 --> 01:49:27.229
Don't beat me in the head
with that mystical bullshit.

01:49:27.312 --> 01:49:30.273
You ain't no psychic.
I just came to buy some weed.

01:49:30.607 --> 01:49:32.025
Well, why didn't you say something?

01:49:32.108 --> 01:49:33.109
I thought you knew.

01:49:33.193 --> 01:49:34.444
Nigga, how much you need?

01:49:34.527 --> 01:49:37.614
Before you start, I just want to say
I'm allergic to tea. So...

01:49:37.906 --> 01:49:38.907
Ha.

01:49:38.990 --> 01:49:41.409
Not TJ Maxx.

01:49:41.493 --> 01:49:42.994
'Cause I've seen that robe there.

01:50:02.013 --> 01:50:04.683
You're gonna rot in hell, Mari!

01:50:04.766 --> 01:50:06.184
I don't want to go to hell.

01:50:06.268 --> 01:50:07.852
You're a fucking bitch, Mari!

01:50:07.936 --> 01:50:09.396
You're a fucking bitch!

01:50:09.479 --> 01:50:11.690
- Mari, you're a fucking...
- Okay!

01:50:11.773 --> 01:50:13.149
No, no. Go like that.

01:50:13.233 --> 01:50:14.502
I feel like maybe I need more nail.

01:50:14.526 --> 01:50:15.735
No, like that.

01:50:17.070 --> 01:50:18.363
Are you watching what I'm doing?

01:50:18.446 --> 01:50:19.446
Who is your pastor?

01:50:19.489 --> 01:50:21.741
I don't like to actually go into church.

01:50:21.825 --> 01:50:24.536
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- So I watch it on the television.

01:50:24.911 --> 01:50:26.955
Who's ever on when I wake up.

01:50:48.476 --> 01:50:51.187
- Are those prescription glasses?
- Oh, boy.

01:50:51.271 --> 01:50:52.814
Now, I'ma tell you one more time.

01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:55.233
Look, you can't use
your privilege in here.

01:50:55.317 --> 01:50:59.529
People who want to become
proficient in the fashion world,

01:50:59.612 --> 01:51:01.364
they purchase gnomes.

01:51:01.948 --> 01:51:03.908
- You see that?
- A gnome? Great.

01:51:03.992 --> 01:51:05.327
You need to get that gnome.

01:51:05.410 --> 01:51:08.288
Don't put it next to any kind
of costume jewellery.

01:51:08.371 --> 01:51:10.457
Because it cancels it out completely.

01:51:10.540 --> 01:51:11.583
So everything you have on,

01:51:11.666 --> 01:51:13.710
you need to put that
on the other side of the home.

01:51:13.793 --> 01:51:14.627
Well, I mean...

01:51:14.711 --> 01:51:16.504
I just have so many gifts.

01:51:16.588 --> 01:51:20.258
- Yeah. Yeah.
- And it's hard to hone in on one.

01:51:20.342 --> 01:51:23.053
But you know where...
I think I know what that gift really is.

01:51:23.136 --> 01:51:25.138
- What, what, what?
- Okay.

01:51:26.222 --> 01:51:27.223
- Women's...
- Women's...

01:51:28.308 --> 01:51:29.726
- empowerment...
- empowerment...

01:51:33.313 --> 01:51:35.857
- coaching, speaking,
- coaching, speaking,

01:51:36.649 --> 01:51:38.276
- and comedy.
- and comedy?

01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:40.236
- Get out of here!
- Baby, yes.

01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:41.780
We are right here.

01:51:41.863 --> 01:51:46.159
I'm also seeing that you having
some trouble with your penis.

01:51:46.242 --> 01:51:49.120
What? Nah, nah,
that was cleared up years ago.

01:51:49.204 --> 01:51:50.830
I'm sorry, it was upside-down.

01:51:50.914 --> 01:51:52.791
- This is not your penis.
- Oh.

01:51:52.874 --> 01:51:54.209
That's your nose.

01:52:04.177 --> 01:52:07.055
That's a six.
These are three sixes in a row. You see?

01:52:07.138 --> 01:52:08.431
- Ah!
- Mm-hmm.

01:52:08.515 --> 01:52:10.350
That's, uh... that's the devil.

01:52:10.433 --> 01:52:12.394
- That's the devil.
- All right.

01:52:12.477 --> 01:52:13.477
You're the devil.

01:52:14.187 --> 01:52:15.480
When I first saw you,

01:52:15.563 --> 01:52:18.358
I did not want to say it
in front of the other girls,

01:52:18.650 --> 01:52:22.195
but there's something
more special about you.

01:52:22.278 --> 01:52:23.488
- Yes. Yes!
- Mm-hmm.

01:52:23.571 --> 01:52:26.116
You're amazing,
and there's something about you

01:52:26.199 --> 01:52:28.743
that is better than
everything that I've seen.

01:52:28.827 --> 01:52:30.971
- Stay in my life forever.
- Let me tell you something.

01:52:30.995 --> 01:52:33.540
Listen. I can put you in my book.

01:52:33.623 --> 01:52:35.542
We can meet once a week and do this.

01:52:35.875 --> 01:52:37.001
I'd have to pay you.

01:52:37.419 --> 01:52:39.838
- Oh, don't, don't.
- I would have to pay you.

01:52:39.921 --> 01:52:42.006
- I insist on paying you.
- No, I don't. No.

01:52:42.090 --> 01:52:45.301
I would like to prepay
ten sessions in advance.

01:52:45.385 --> 01:52:46.970
- Cash only.
- Okay.
