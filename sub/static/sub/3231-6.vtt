00:52.645 --> 00:54.021
Let's get something straight.

00:54.563 --> 00:57.775
This, the chemistry, is my realm.

00:57.983 --> 00:59.818
I am in charge of the cooking.

01:00.027 --> 01:02.821
Out there on the street,
you deal with that.

01:05.866 --> 01:09.203
As far as our customers go, I don't
want to know anything about them.

01:09.411 --> 01:11.664
<i>I don't wanna see them,</i>
<i>I don't wanna hear them. </i>

01:11.872 --> 01:15.626
<i>I want no interaction with them</i>
<i>whatsoever. </i>

01:18.295 --> 01:22.424
This operation is you and me,
and I'm the silent partner.

01:22.633 --> 01:25.094
You got any issues with that?

01:25.678 --> 01:27.346
Whatever, man.

01:33.811 --> 01:36.021
No matter what happens...

01:36.480 --> 01:38.273
...no more bloodshed.

01:39.525 --> 01:40.859
<i>No violence.</i>

02:35.181 --> 02:36.975
Walt?

02:37.183 --> 02:39.561
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah.

02:39.769 --> 02:41.521
Yeah, I'm okay.

02:42.772 --> 02:46.276
You know, honey, you...
You really don't have to...

02:47.318 --> 02:50.822
Look, I like being here with you.

02:51.698 --> 02:53.283
Yeah.

02:53.491 --> 02:56.453
I'm only saying that,
you know, I'd be okay...

02:56.661 --> 02:59.122
...that really, if you wanna go...

03:00.540 --> 03:04.711
You know, actually, it would
make me feel a little better...

03:04.919 --> 03:08.590
...knowing that you were there
when Walter Jr. Gets home from school.

03:12.677 --> 03:14.262
Okay.

03:16.014 --> 03:18.349
All right.
So you'll call me when you're finished?

03:18.558 --> 03:20.268
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

03:23.146 --> 03:26.399
Oh, and have you been
in touch with Elliot?

03:26.608 --> 03:30.111
Because I haven't seen
a cheque from him.

03:30.320 --> 03:32.238
Yes, I... I got it.

03:32.447 --> 03:35.575
- Really?
- It came, yeah. And I...

03:35.784 --> 03:37.410
Yeah, it did. It came last week...

03:37.619 --> 03:40.747
...and I put it right into
my credit union account.

03:40.955 --> 03:44.000
So I'm taking care of it.

03:45.710 --> 03:47.587
- Good.
- Yeah.

03:48.129 --> 03:50.715
So we're good. We're good.

03:53.343 --> 03:58.890
Could you not deposit this
until Monday?

04:01.226 --> 04:02.852
Thank you.

04:03.103 --> 04:06.397
Call if the discomfort's too much,
otherwise we'll see you next week.

04:07.732 --> 04:09.192
Yeah.

04:30.046 --> 04:34.092
<i>Chemical reactions involve</i>
<i>change on two leveIs:</i>

04:34.300 --> 04:36.761
Matter and energy.

04:37.178 --> 04:43.017
When a reaction is gradual,
the change in energy is slight.

04:43.226 --> 04:46.563
I mean, you don't even notice
the reaction is happening.

04:46.771 --> 04:53.695
For example, when rust collects
on the underside of a car, right?

04:57.490 --> 05:01.745
But if a reaction happens quickly...

05:01.953 --> 05:05.623
...otherwise harmless substances
can interact in a way...

05:05.832 --> 05:10.837
...that generates
enormous bursts of energy.

05:14.299 --> 05:21.097
Who can give me an example
of rapid chemical reaction?

05:25.477 --> 05:27.687
Hint, hint. Right here.

05:28.438 --> 05:30.106
Like, an explosion?

05:31.399 --> 05:34.569
Yes, good. Explosions.

05:34.778 --> 05:39.240
Explosions are the result
of chemical reactions...

05:39.449 --> 05:41.951
...happening almost instantaneously.

05:42.160 --> 05:45.705
And the faster reactants,
i. e. Explosives...

05:45.914 --> 05:49.584
And fulminative mercury
is a prime example of that.

05:50.126 --> 05:52.962
The faster they undergo change...

05:53.171 --> 05:56.132
...the more violent the explosion.

06:00.220 --> 06:01.930
Explosions.

06:02.138 --> 06:05.225
Okay, listen, why don't you
start reading on your own...

06:05.433 --> 06:08.937
...from the top of chapter seven.

06:23.785 --> 06:25.036
You okay?

06:26.329 --> 06:28.456
I got it, Mr. White.

06:28.665 --> 06:30.291
Don't worry.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.710
You got kids to teach.

06:53.189 --> 06:55.108
Thanks, Hugo.

07:06.119 --> 07:08.621
<i>He's starting to lose weight... </i>

07:08.830 --> 07:13.543
...which is tough, to see that.

07:14.085 --> 07:19.799
I can already feel the difference
when I put my arms around him.

07:26.514 --> 07:29.642
- Can I talk to...?
- Of course.

07:30.685 --> 07:32.187
Walt.

07:32.979 --> 07:35.607
When you don't let me in...

07:35.815 --> 07:38.276
...when you don't tell me
what's going on...

07:39.194 --> 07:42.906
I mean, it's like I feel like you don't
even want me around sometimes.

07:43.114 --> 07:44.240
No.

07:44.866 --> 07:48.244
And recently, these afternoons...

07:48.453 --> 07:50.872
...when you're coming home so late...

07:51.081 --> 07:55.752
...and we're just left wondering
where you are.

07:56.961 --> 07:58.129
Yeah, Dad.

08:00.090 --> 08:01.633
What's up with that?

08:03.343 --> 08:09.182
Walt, is there anything else
you're holding back from your family?

08:12.560 --> 08:14.646
Now's the time to share.

08:17.315 --> 08:21.653
Well, I...

08:22.362 --> 08:26.491
I like to be alone, I mean, at times.

08:26.699 --> 08:29.911
And it's not about you, really.

08:30.412 --> 08:34.039
It's just that sometimes
it feels better...

08:34.249 --> 08:38.962
...not to talk at all...

08:40.087 --> 08:41.923
...about anything...

08:42.424 --> 08:43.799
...to anyone.

08:44.342 --> 08:47.929
Alone time can be helpful,
for some types.

08:49.514 --> 08:53.017
Maybe knowing what you do
when you're alone...

08:53.476 --> 08:56.855
...might make it easier for your family
to be more accepting...

08:57.063 --> 09:00.859
...of whatever it is you do alone.

09:02.569 --> 09:04.154
Well...

09:05.739 --> 09:09.033
...I like to go on walks...

09:09.701 --> 09:14.038
...a couple of times a week,
maybe more, after work.

09:14.247 --> 09:20.211
And I really enjoy the nature.

09:20.837 --> 09:23.548
<i>You know, the cacti... </i>

09:24.758 --> 09:28.094
<i>...vegetation, that kind of thing. </i>

09:29.387 --> 09:34.517
<i>It's really very therapeutic. </i>

10:03.630 --> 10:05.423
Yo, God, are you okay?

10:05.632 --> 10:08.510
- Hey, you did that shit?
- I'm dizzy. No.

10:08.718 --> 10:11.429
I'm just dizzy. I need air.

10:11.638 --> 10:14.182
- God, I feel like I'm burning up.
- Sit down, sit down.

10:14.390 --> 10:16.559
I gotta take this off.

10:19.270 --> 10:20.688
Sit down, get some air.

10:22.565 --> 10:24.234
Oh, God.

10:25.110 --> 10:26.486
Here.

10:30.448 --> 10:32.534
- Better?
- Yeah, that's better.

10:39.374 --> 10:41.418
When were you gonna tell me?

10:44.337 --> 10:46.131
Tell you what?

10:46.589 --> 10:48.341
Cancer.

10:48.550 --> 10:50.593
You got it, right?

10:57.725 --> 10:59.144
How did you know?

10:59.352 --> 11:03.565
My aunt had one of those
dots on her...

11:03.773 --> 11:07.569
...to target the radiation.
What, is it in your lung?

11:08.945 --> 11:11.740
I'm your partner, man,
you should've told me.

11:11.948 --> 11:14.868
God, that's not cool, okay?
Not at all.

11:17.579 --> 11:18.747
What stage are you?

11:21.166 --> 11:22.542
Three-A.

11:24.753 --> 11:26.713
Gone into your lymph nodes.

11:39.350 --> 11:41.019
Your aunt...

11:41.644 --> 11:44.856
...how bad was she
when they caught it?

11:45.065 --> 11:48.151
Bad enough, she didn't last long.

11:49.527 --> 11:53.114
- How long?
- Seven months.

11:57.535 --> 11:59.120
God.

11:59.329 --> 12:00.955
I get it now.

12:01.164 --> 12:03.583
That's why you're doing all this.

12:03.792 --> 12:07.003
You want to make some cash
for your people before you check out.

12:07.212 --> 12:09.172
- You got a problem with that?
- You tell me.

12:09.380 --> 12:12.884
You're the one that looks like
he just crawled out of a microwave.

12:18.556 --> 12:20.767
You gonna be able to
finish the batch?

12:20.975 --> 12:22.102
Yes.

12:23.019 --> 12:24.062
All right.

12:28.233 --> 12:29.859
No.

12:30.985 --> 12:32.737
You do it.

12:35.240 --> 12:36.950
Me?

12:37.158 --> 12:38.701
Yeah.

12:38.910 --> 12:42.122
What happened to your mad skills?

12:48.420 --> 12:50.505
Go on. Here.

12:50.713 --> 12:52.298
You do it.

12:55.552 --> 12:57.512
You can do it.

13:02.684 --> 13:05.645
If you have any questions,
I'll be right out here.

13:11.151 --> 13:15.447
The next time, put an ice pack
on your head during chemo.

13:16.072 --> 13:19.409
My aunt said it helped
with the hair loss.

13:56.029 --> 13:59.157
What's this, Christmas?

14:01.576 --> 14:04.913
This that one we found way out
in the boonies at the cook site?

14:08.291 --> 14:10.460
- Holy shit.
- What?

14:10.668 --> 14:13.922
Lab says they pulled up and imprint
of some writing on the inside...

14:14.130 --> 14:16.925
...Magic Marker or something.
- Yeah? What's it say?

14:17.133 --> 14:20.553
"Property of
J.P. Winn Chemistry Lab. "

14:20.929 --> 14:22.097
That's Walt's school.

15:41.801 --> 15:43.970
We were supposed to start at 3.

15:44.179 --> 15:47.640
Hey, I'm out there making
fat stacks, man. Chill.

15:47.849 --> 15:52.020
Hey, prepaid cell phone. Use it.

16:00.195 --> 16:03.448
- How much is this?
- Twenty-six big ones.

16:03.740 --> 16:06.868
Is that all?
Twenty-six-thousand dollars?

16:07.077 --> 16:10.997
No, that's 2600,
and your share is 13...

16:11.790 --> 16:14.542
...minus 25 bucks for that phone.

16:14.751 --> 16:17.796
- How much meth did you sell?
- Nearly an ounce.

16:22.133 --> 16:23.176
Last time I checked...

16:23.384 --> 16:27.013
...there were 16 ounces to a pound.
What did you do with the rest, smoke it?

16:27.222 --> 16:29.349
Yo, I've been out all night
slinging crystal.

16:29.557 --> 16:32.602
You think it's cake moving
a pound of meth one teenth at a time?

16:32.811 --> 16:34.813
Why are you selling it
in small quantities?

16:35.021 --> 16:37.607
Why don't you just sell
the whole pound at once?

16:37.816 --> 16:39.734
To who?
What do I look like, Scarface?

16:39.943 --> 16:44.322
This is unacceptable.
I am breaking the law here.

16:44.531 --> 16:46.783
This return is too little for the risk.

16:46.991 --> 16:48.993
I thought you'd be ready
for another pound.

16:49.202 --> 16:50.912
You may know a lot
about chemistry...

16:51.121 --> 16:53.998
...but you don't know jack
about slinging dope.

16:54.207 --> 16:57.335
Well, I'll tell you, I know
a lack of motivation when I see it.

16:57.544 --> 16:59.462
Oh, my...

16:59.671 --> 17:03.466
Come on, you've gotta be more
imaginative, you know, just...

17:03.675 --> 17:06.094
Just think outside the box here.

17:06.301 --> 17:09.556
We have to move our product in bulk,
wholesale.

17:09.763 --> 17:13.768
Now, how do we do that?

17:14.894 --> 17:18.147
- What do you mean, to a distributor?
- Yes. Yes, that's what we need.

17:18.356 --> 17:21.734
We need a distributor.
Now, do you know anyone like that?

17:21.943 --> 17:25.029
Yeah, I mean, I used to,
until you killed him.

17:38.918 --> 17:42.922
So who took Krazy-8's place?

17:43.131 --> 17:45.675
Some guy named Tuco.

17:45.884 --> 17:47.260
Badass, from what I hear.

17:48.178 --> 17:51.890
Tuco, okay.
So then just go talk to Tuco.

17:52.098 --> 17:55.018
Right. Like, " Hello, sir.
Hey, I know you don't know me...

17:55.226 --> 17:58.480
...would you be interested in a
felony quantity of methamphetamine?"

17:58.688 --> 18:01.649
Well, yes, but maybe with
a little more salesmanship, perhaps?

18:01.858 --> 18:03.818
You just don't get it, man.
This guy's OG.

18:04.027 --> 18:07.614
- What... What does that mean?
- Jesus, look, he's off our level, man.

18:07.822 --> 18:10.909
He's not gonna do business
with some dude he doesn't know.

18:11.451 --> 18:13.244
You don't understand
the way it works.

18:13.453 --> 18:16.539
You can't just bum-rush
some high-level ice man...

18:16.748 --> 18:18.374
...and start cutting deals.

18:18.583 --> 18:22.212
Okay? It's risky. You need an intro,
you need someone to vouch.

18:22.420 --> 18:24.339
Well, who introduced you to Krazy-8?

18:24.547 --> 18:27.383
Emilio, and that's only because
I knew him from third grade.

18:27.592 --> 18:31.096
- And we can't talk to Emilio, because...
- All right, all right, all right.

18:31.304 --> 18:36.601
Look, I'm telling you,
Mr. White, it's too risky. Okay?

18:36.810 --> 18:39.479
I mean, we're making money.
Why can't you be satisfied...

18:39.687 --> 18:41.773
...with the way it is?
- Oh, come on! Jesus!

18:41.981 --> 18:44.567
Just grow some fucking balls!

19:25.900 --> 19:30.572
- Wait till Monday again?
- Yes, please. Thank you.

19:40.165 --> 19:42.000
Oh, God.

20:00.685 --> 20:02.520
Mr. White.

20:08.276 --> 20:10.278
Thank you, Hugo.

20:35.136 --> 20:36.763
- Knock, knock.
- Oh, hey.

20:37.555 --> 20:41.309
- How you feeling, Walt?
- Good. Yeah.

20:41.935 --> 20:44.187
Are you up for having a visitor?

20:44.521 --> 20:47.857
- Hey, buddy.
- Hank.

20:48.066 --> 20:49.943
Well, let me know
if you need anything.

20:50.151 --> 20:52.570
I will. Thank you, Carmen.

20:54.197 --> 20:55.740
Damn.

20:55.949 --> 20:59.119
Chick's got an ass like an onion,
makes me wanna cry.

21:00.578 --> 21:03.873
So, what... What are you doing here?

21:04.082 --> 21:08.253
Well, I had some questions
I wanted to run by you, work-related.

21:08.461 --> 21:10.296
You feeling okay?
I can come back later.

21:10.505 --> 21:13.466
No, no, no, I'm fine.
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

21:14.384 --> 21:17.303
What do you mean,
"work-related," though?

21:18.721 --> 21:21.933
Do you recognise that?

21:25.061 --> 21:26.980
No. No.

21:28.523 --> 21:30.150
Well, that was used to cook meth.

21:31.484 --> 21:35.447
Found it out on some Indian land
about 40 miles from here.

21:35.655 --> 21:39.409
Old label on the inside used to say:

21:39.993 --> 21:42.620
- "J.P. Winn Chemistry Lab. "
- Really?

21:43.204 --> 21:45.665
I don't understand
how that came from here.

21:45.874 --> 21:47.792
I was hoping
you could help me with that.

21:48.001 --> 21:51.755
We found it near an abandoned car
that belonged to one of our snitches.

21:54.507 --> 21:55.800
A snitch?

21:56.009 --> 21:57.969
Yeah, one of our
confidential informants.

21:58.511 --> 21:59.721
Went missing a while back.

21:59.929 --> 22:03.141
No body yet,
but we're pretty sure, you know:

22:03.349 --> 22:08.188
Probably chopped up into little pieces
and fed to the buzzards.

22:09.355 --> 22:11.149
Anyway, you...

22:11.357 --> 22:14.194
Any respirators like that
go missing lately?

22:14.652 --> 22:17.155
No. No.

22:17.489 --> 22:19.741
No, I mean, not that I know of.

22:20.283 --> 22:22.368
- I'll need to look at that inventory.
- Sure.

22:22.577 --> 22:25.038
Sure.
I've got a list hanging on the wall.

22:25.246 --> 22:27.499
Do you mind if I take a look
at your storeroom?

22:27.707 --> 22:29.542
Not at all. No.

22:29.751 --> 22:31.544
Be my guest.

22:34.631 --> 22:36.424
All right, so who's got keys?

22:36.633 --> 22:39.094
The science faculty,
the staff, Carmen...

22:39.302 --> 22:43.348
...the vice-principal has the master,
and me.

22:43.556 --> 22:45.475
How about students?

22:45.809 --> 22:48.603
No, no. No students have keys.

22:48.812 --> 22:50.772
Shit, I should hope not.
My question is...

22:50.980 --> 22:53.733
...do any of the little pissants
know where you keep them?

22:53.942 --> 22:55.402
I don't... I don't think so, no.

22:55.610 --> 22:58.696
I mean, besides, I keep them right here
in my pocket anyway, so...

22:58.905 --> 23:01.366
Walt, look,
I know they're your students...

23:01.574 --> 23:03.993
...but do not underestimate them.
Big mistake.

23:04.202 --> 23:07.205
- Are there any other respirators?
- No.

23:07.414 --> 23:10.250
Because I'm counting six,
inventory says eight.

23:14.129 --> 23:16.589
- Glassware looking a little sparse.
- Is it?

23:16.798 --> 23:22.762
Yeah. You're missing a couple of
Erlenmeyer flasks, at least.

23:22.971 --> 23:24.556
Oh, yeah.

23:25.056 --> 23:28.351
A five-thousand millilitre
round-bottom.

23:28.560 --> 23:31.813
Meth heads love to brew in this baby.

23:32.814 --> 23:36.568
- You gonna answer that?
- Oh, no, it's just... No, I don't...

23:36.776 --> 23:38.570
Maybe it's Skyler
and she's in trouble.

23:38.778 --> 23:42.741
Shit, don't ignore it on my account.
Answer it. Come on, I got stuff to do.

23:43.408 --> 23:45.368
- Jeez.
- Okay.

23:46.703 --> 23:49.914
- Hello?
<i>- Yo, what's up, Mr. W?</i>

23:51.082 --> 23:52.250
Speaking.

23:52.459 --> 23:54.753
- Bad time to talk?
<i>- Absolutely. </i>

23:54.961 --> 23:56.504
All right, so just listen.

23:56.713 --> 23:59.716
So you know that guy
we were talking about, Tuco?

23:59.924 --> 24:03.219
Turns out my boy, Skinny Pete,
was in the same cell block with him...

24:03.428 --> 24:04.679
...over at Los Lunas.

24:04.888 --> 24:09.642
<i>So we got our in. We're hauling</i>
<i>a pound to the dude right now. </i>

24:10.185 --> 24:14.064
Okay, then. Well, thank you.
Thank you very much for calling.

24:16.858 --> 24:18.943
My doctor is very solicitous.

24:19.152 --> 24:22.655
Hey, look, buddy. The last thing
I wanna do is get you in hot water.

24:22.864 --> 24:25.700
But some meth-monkey
had a feeding frenzy in here, okay?

24:26.242 --> 24:28.787
You gotta keep better watch
over your turf.

24:28.995 --> 24:30.288
I will.

24:30.497 --> 24:33.500
We don't want people
to start wondering about you, right?

24:40.840 --> 24:44.135
Right. No. Right. Absolutely not.

24:47.722 --> 24:49.682
So you're sure
you're tight with this guy?

24:49.891 --> 24:52.685
Two nuts in a ball sack, yo.

25:08.993 --> 25:10.954
Yo, man, I'm Skinny Pete.

25:19.921 --> 25:23.425
Maybe this isn't such a good idea, yo.
Come on.

25:27.512 --> 25:30.473
Yeah, man, that's what's happening.

25:43.027 --> 25:45.613
Yo, Tuco's expecting us.

25:55.373 --> 25:57.751
No need, man. Me and Tuco go back.

26:12.182 --> 26:15.602
Tuco, what's happening, my brother?

26:21.357 --> 26:25.403
Sick crib, yo. You've been keeping
it real since you been sprung.

26:25.612 --> 26:28.531
- What's it been, like, a year?
- This your boy?

26:28.740 --> 26:31.576
Yeah, Jesse. Dude with the glass
I was telling you about.

26:31.785 --> 26:33.787
Hey, man, yeah.
I've heard a lot about you.

26:35.288 --> 26:36.498
Break out the ice.

26:53.431 --> 26:57.102
- Take a bump.
- No worries, man, I'm no cop.

26:58.520 --> 27:00.146
I said, hit it.

27:03.191 --> 27:04.734
All right.

27:19.874 --> 27:23.294
This kicks like a mule
with his balls wrapped in duct tape.

27:25.213 --> 27:27.298
- Where'd you get it?
- I cooked it.

27:29.342 --> 27:30.385
Bullshit.

27:32.846 --> 27:34.097
Who you working for?

27:34.848 --> 27:39.561
No one, man. I mean, I have a partner
that I cook with, but that's it.

27:42.439 --> 27:44.023
All right.

27:46.860 --> 27:48.236
We got a deal.

27:48.445 --> 27:50.321
See, I told you Tuco
would hook you up.

27:50.530 --> 27:53.366
Cool. I haven't said how much.

28:02.333 --> 28:05.253
All right. How much?

28:05.462 --> 28:07.255
Thirty-five large for the pound.

28:12.302 --> 28:15.221
Well, I mean, you're a little light, <i>ese</i>.

28:18.725 --> 28:20.977
It's all right, don't sweat it.
It's all good.

28:21.186 --> 28:23.104
It's good. Go on, get out of here.

28:24.564 --> 28:27.108
- What about the money?
- You'll get it.

28:27.317 --> 28:28.985
This is a consignment operation.

28:30.653 --> 28:33.907
You want me to flow it
thirty-five G's?

28:35.867 --> 28:37.368
You don't trust me?

28:37.577 --> 28:39.537
Hey, no, no, hey. It's not that, man.

28:39.746 --> 28:42.874
It's just, you know,
I don't do business that way.

28:43.083 --> 28:45.752
Tough shit, the deal is done.

28:48.129 --> 28:52.133
You said this was cool, okay?
Money for meth, cash up front.

28:52.342 --> 28:54.385
Don't front, dude, Tuco's good for it.

28:55.595 --> 28:58.598
I don't need your punk ass
to vouch for me.

29:02.894 --> 29:04.687
Come on.

29:05.605 --> 29:07.816
Oh, come on.

29:18.868 --> 29:24.082
All right. You brought me
some really clean crystal.

29:25.834 --> 29:28.211
You really want your money up front?

29:51.943 --> 29:53.069
Up front.

30:23.433 --> 30:29.022
Nobody moves crystal
in the South Valley but me, bitch.

30:49.209 --> 30:50.252
Morning, Hugo.

30:52.546 --> 30:55.340
You don't mind if I call you Hugo,
Hugo?

30:59.386 --> 31:01.722
We've never had a problem
with Hugo, ever.

31:01.930 --> 31:03.599
Is that Uncle Hank?

31:05.017 --> 31:08.145
Right, what do you got there?
All right. Book him.

31:09.229 --> 31:11.982
Uncle Hank's
arresting Mr. Archilleya.

31:12.691 --> 31:15.611
This doesn't make any sense
to me at all. I don't understand.

31:15.819 --> 31:18.822
I got two words for you:
Background check. How about that?

31:21.241 --> 31:24.328
<i>Yo, yo, yo. </i>
<i>1-4-8, 3-to-the-3, to-the-6, to-the-9.</i>

31:24.536 --> 31:27.414
<i>Representing the ABQ.</i>
<i>What up, biatch?</i>

31:27.623 --> 31:29.458
<i>Leave it at the tone.</i>

31:29.666 --> 31:33.295
Where the hell are you?
Call me back.

31:33.503 --> 31:35.881
- Hey, Walt?
- Yeah?

31:36.089 --> 31:41.345
- Hank's about to deal.
- Okay, I'll be right there.

31:47.142 --> 31:49.811
All right,
let's see what the turn brings us.

31:51.104 --> 31:54.358
You're looking good, Walt.
Your colour's better.

31:54.566 --> 31:56.318
Yeah? Thanks.

31:56.526 --> 31:59.321
He's actually on
the pretty strong stuff now.

31:59.529 --> 32:03.200
Dr. Delcavoli's trying to talk him into
taking some time off from work, but...

32:03.408 --> 32:05.994
Well, actually,
I just talked to Carmen this morning...

32:06.203 --> 32:09.206
...and they're getting a substitute
for a few weeks.

32:09.414 --> 32:11.833
- Good.
- I just didn't have a chance to tell you.

32:12.042 --> 32:14.586
- Sorry.
- Your bet, tough guy.

32:14.795 --> 32:16.463
Check.

32:17.297 --> 32:18.340
Yeah, check.

32:18.882 --> 32:20.759
Cheque's in the mail.

32:21.593 --> 32:24.304
- Ten million.
- That's 25 million, blue's 10.

32:24.513 --> 32:27.307
Well, then, 25 million,
because that's how I roll.

32:27.849 --> 32:29.351
Hey, Uncle Hank...

32:29.560 --> 32:33.522
...I heard you arrested
Mr. Archilleya the other day.

32:33.730 --> 32:34.815
He's a pretty cool guy.

32:35.023 --> 32:40.821
Well, turns out he has a record.
Yeah, a couple of possession beefs.

32:41.029 --> 32:44.575
We figured he was the guy that was
stealing your school's chemistry gear.

32:44.783 --> 32:48.996
I mean, you know,
he had a key, fit the profile.

32:49.204 --> 32:52.457
And when we searched his truck,
we found a big old fat blunt.

32:52.666 --> 32:55.919
Which goes to prove
old huge Hugo ain't so cool after all.

32:56.128 --> 32:59.881
- It's to you, Walt.
- Yeah, I'll call.

33:00.090 --> 33:02.217
You know,
I can't believe the school system...

33:02.426 --> 33:04.261
...didn't know about this guy's record.

33:04.469 --> 33:07.014
I mean, that's scary.
How could something like that...

33:07.222 --> 33:09.600
...just slip through the cracks?
- I don't know.

33:09.808 --> 33:14.897
I mean, for what it's worth,
Hugo just doesn't strike me as a thief.

33:15.105 --> 33:18.483
Yeah, well, nothing personal, Walt,
but you wouldn't know a criminal...

33:18.692 --> 33:21.403
...if he was close enough
to check you for a hernia.

33:23.405 --> 33:28.035
That said, we got a search warrant,
and we tore old Hugo's house apart.

33:28.243 --> 33:30.871
Turns out
he's a major-league pothead.

33:31.079 --> 33:33.498
But he didn't raid your chemistry set.

33:34.124 --> 33:35.167
You hiding something?

33:42.132 --> 33:45.510
I'm in. And the river card.

33:48.138 --> 33:50.140
Yeah, I got nothing, I'm out.

33:50.349 --> 33:52.100
I'm out.

33:56.730 --> 34:00.359
When old holes-in-her-purse bails,
you know you're in deep.

34:00.984 --> 34:03.070
Looks like it's you and me, buddy.

34:04.238 --> 34:06.949
What's gonna happen to him. Hugo?

34:07.658 --> 34:10.744
Well, I mean, he's gonna
lose his job, like he should.

34:10.953 --> 34:14.748
Probably spend a couple months in
county, because it's not his first rap.

34:16.291 --> 34:18.043
I'm waiting.

34:20.337 --> 34:22.630
You gonna man up
or are you gonna puss out?

34:22.839 --> 34:24.466
Hank.

34:26.092 --> 34:27.636
Sorry.

34:30.556 --> 34:32.266
I'm all in.

34:35.686 --> 34:41.440
Dude.
You bad, bad, bad, horrible liar.

34:42.985 --> 34:44.987
What are you smoking there, huh?

34:46.196 --> 34:48.864
You got a heart?
You got the flush, don't you?

34:53.495 --> 34:56.456
Nope. Not falling for it, buddy. I fold.

34:58.458 --> 35:00.502
- Talk about anti-climactic.
- Hey.

35:00.711 --> 35:02.963
Your cards couldn't have been
that bad, come on.

35:03.171 --> 35:05.299
Oh, my God. You threw away an ace?

35:05.507 --> 35:08.260
- What are you doing?
- And a cowboy for...

35:14.474 --> 35:16.768
A handful of nothing.

36:14.117 --> 36:15.953
<i>Yeah, what up?</i>

36:17.537 --> 36:20.666
Who is this?
I was dialling Jesse Pinkman.

36:20.874 --> 36:23.627
<i>Hey, man, he's out. </i>

36:24.378 --> 36:26.421
Well, where is he, then?

36:40.644 --> 36:42.104
You the guy?

36:42.813 --> 36:45.023
Yeah, I'm the guy.

36:50.153 --> 36:51.947
How is he?

36:52.698 --> 36:55.576
Got some busted ribs, and like that.

36:56.535 --> 36:58.161
Got messed up pretty good.

36:58.912 --> 37:02.749
I was all, like,
"Damn, Tuco, chill, <i>ese</i>."

37:03.667 --> 37:06.336
I don't know what got into him.
Seriously.

37:09.256 --> 37:11.425
He's out, man. Way out.

37:12.426 --> 37:14.720
They got him doped up big time.

37:20.601 --> 37:22.102
So you're the cook, huh?

37:24.396 --> 37:26.648
Yo, I didn't catch your name.

37:40.579 --> 37:42.998
Tell me about this Tuco.

37:43.790 --> 37:46.084
Tell me everything about him.

39:29.563 --> 39:30.647
Morning.

39:33.650 --> 39:35.652
Could you pass the butter, please?

39:38.363 --> 39:39.865
Badass, Dad.

40:26.912 --> 40:31.166
Hey, cue ball. Need directions?

40:33.210 --> 40:34.294
You Tuco?

40:39.800 --> 40:44.263
I want to talk to Tuco,
and I'm not leaving until I do.

42:08.305 --> 42:09.598
What's your name?

42:10.515 --> 42:12.434
Heisenberg.

42:12.643 --> 42:16.230
Heisenberg. Okay.

42:16.480 --> 42:18.148
Have a seat, Heisenberg.

42:19.524 --> 42:22.069
I don't imagine I'll be here very long.

42:22.277 --> 42:23.904
No?

42:24.529 --> 42:26.073
All right.

42:27.616 --> 42:28.700
Be that way.

42:31.620 --> 42:33.205
It's your meeting.

42:33.413 --> 42:36.583
Why don't you start talking
and tell me what you want?

42:37.709 --> 42:39.503
Fifty thousand dollars.

42:41.546 --> 42:45.509
Oh, man.
Fifty G's? How you figure that?

42:45.717 --> 42:48.220
Thirty-five
for the pound of meth you stole...

42:48.428 --> 42:51.223
...and another fifteen
for my partner's pain and suffering.

42:57.062 --> 42:58.855
Partner.

43:05.529 --> 43:09.241
Oh, yeah, I remember that little bitch.

43:09.783 --> 43:11.535
So you must be Daddy.

43:20.252 --> 43:22.254
Let me get this straight.

43:23.880 --> 43:25.757
I steal your dope...

43:27.426 --> 43:30.679
...I beat the piss
out of your mule boy...

43:31.763 --> 43:35.976
...and then you walk in here
and you bring me more meth?

43:39.897 --> 43:41.732
That's a brilliant plan, <i>ese</i>.

43:41.940 --> 43:43.442
Brilliant.

43:44.776 --> 43:47.613
You got one part of that wrong.

43:51.575 --> 43:54.244
This is not meth.

44:21.438 --> 44:23.148
Are you fucking nuts?

44:23.357 --> 44:24.733
You wanna find out?

44:25.984 --> 44:28.570
No, no, Gonzo, <i>calma. </i>

44:33.033 --> 44:36.370
You got balls, I'll give you that.

44:36.578 --> 44:40.165
All right, all right.
I'll give you your money.

44:44.211 --> 44:48.715
That crystal
that your partner brought me...

44:48.924 --> 44:53.971
...it sold faster than ten-dollar ass
in TJ.

44:57.724 --> 45:01.562
Let's say you bring me
another pound next week.

45:05.065 --> 45:06.400
Money up front.

45:07.067 --> 45:08.569
All right.

45:09.444 --> 45:10.737
Money up front.

45:15.784 --> 45:18.579
Sometimes you gotta rob
to keep your riches.

45:20.289 --> 45:23.500
Just as long as we got
an understanding.

45:26.086 --> 45:30.549
One pound is not gonna cut it.
You have to take two.

45:36.972 --> 45:38.181
Oh, really?

45:39.600 --> 45:42.269
Hey, what is that shit?

45:44.688 --> 45:46.982
Fulminated mercury...

45:47.900 --> 45:50.444
...and a little tweak of chemistry.

45:51.305 --> 45:57.410
