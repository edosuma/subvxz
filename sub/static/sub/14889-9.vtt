I can’t believe
this is happening.

01:26.152 --> 01:28.388
Jennifer’s father
comes to town...

01:28.421 --> 01:30.423
...it’s my big chance
to impress him

01:30.456 --> 01:33.393
and I slam the taxi
door on his hand.

01:35.428 --> 01:37.363
Well, cousin,
look on the bright side.

01:37.397 --> 01:39.465
Maybe the pain in his hand
will make him forget

01:39.499 --> 01:42.402
you set his
necktie on fire.

01:42.435 --> 01:45.806
I was just trying to light
his after‐dinner cigar.

Throwing that glass
of red wine on him

01:50.844 --> 01:53.313
was real quick thinking.

I knew I should have
ordered white wine.

See, the ball is
attached to a computer

03:57.738 --> 03:59.272

your golf swing

exactly how far

and in what direction
you hit the ball.

lie about this?

No.

I was counting on you

to eat the grass so evenly.

you tee off first?

09:23.797 --> 09:24.931
Sure.

Don’t make it too obvious.

Don’t worry, I can make
a golf ball do anything.

say 260 yards

the middle of the fairway.

dating you, Larry.

11:53.079 --> 11:55.248
...in the apartment
you were terrible.

11:55.281 --> 11:58.218
Out here you’re hitting
the ball a mile. What happened?

11:58.251 --> 12:00.253
Well, cousin, you know
after the other day

12:00.286 --> 12:02.188
when I struck out
with the Swing Doctor

12:02.222 --> 12:04.490
I took some private time

12:04.525 --> 12:06.960
and I came to a concussion.

12:09.796 --> 12:13.366
I really stink
at American golf.

12:13.399 --> 12:14.768
Now, on the other hand

12:14.801 --> 12:16.970
I’m not one
to blow my own nose

12:17.003 --> 12:21.474

12:24.410 --> 12:27.347
So I decided to just
do what comes naturally

12:27.380 --> 12:29.783
even if, as you say,
it makes me look like

12:29.816 --> 12:31.752
I’ve been struck
by lightning.

12:33.219 --> 12:34.420

12:34.454 --> 12:36.322
...you’re beating Mr. Lyons.

12:36.356 --> 12:39.225

be hard not to.

12:41.862 --> 12:45.131
‐Mr. Lyons is our guest.
‐I know that.

12:45.165 --> 12:49.970
It is against the rules...
to beat the guest.

12:50.003 --> 12:53.473
‐Oh, why you didn’t tell me?
‐Well, I assumed you knew.

12:53.507 --> 12:55.441
[imitating Larry]
No, I didn’t know.

12:58.444 --> 13:02.583
Well, you know, I personally
would never say this.

13:02.616 --> 13:04.951
But there are those
who would call

13:04.985 --> 13:06.520
what you’re doing...

13:08.622 --> 13:10.090
...cheating.

never cheated in my life.

‐Ever.

‐I know.
‐Ever.

13:16.963 --> 13:19.065
I know, Balki,
that’s why I just wanted

13:19.099 --> 13:21.034
to point it out to you.

13:24.938 --> 13:27.207
Cousin, I don’t want
to cheat Mr. Lyons.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.876
I don’t want
to cheat anybody.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.444
Alright, what
you have to do

13:31.477 --> 13:33.346
is just continue
to hit the ball

13:33.379 --> 13:36.349
as far and as
hard as you can...

13:36.382 --> 13:40.153
...but don’t get it
anywhere near the hole...

13:40.186 --> 13:42.288

10 or 11 times.

‐Like Mr. Lyons is doing?
‐Yes. Yes.

Mr. Lyons is doing.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.598
And then everything
will be okay?

13:51.632 --> 13:54.300
Then everyone
will be happy.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.469
Thank you for
the tip, cousin.

13:56.503 --> 13:59.439
I will do my best
to do my worst.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.243

14:03.276 --> 14:04.410
Waka waka waka

14:04.444 --> 14:07.147
waka waka waka yahoo.

14:08.381 --> 14:09.616
Seven.

14:15.522 --> 14:16.623
Waka waka waka

14:16.657 --> 14:17.891
waka waka waka.

14:17.924 --> 14:19.860
Yahoo.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.262
Eight.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.932
(Larry)
Don’t overdo it.

14:29.536 --> 14:30.604
Waka waka waka

14:30.637 --> 14:31.672
waka waka waka.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.607
Ya‐hoo.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.008
Oops.

14:36.510 --> 14:38.044
What’s the score
now, Larry?

14:38.078 --> 14:40.213
Well...let’s see.

14:41.515 --> 14:46.219
You and your dad are
just one stroke behind.

14:46.252 --> 14:48.589
Uh, gee, Mr. Lyons,
looks like Balki and I

14:48.622 --> 14:51.391
just fell apart
on the back nine.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.627
Well, don’t be too hard
on yourself, Larry.

14:53.660 --> 14:55.395
Better players
than you have choked

14:55.428 --> 14:56.997
when I put the pressure on.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.371
Great shot, dad!

15:05.405 --> 15:08.041
Yes, great shot, Mr. Lyons.

15:09.643 --> 15:11.912
I could play better
when I was six.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.616
Guys, thanks for
doing this for me.

15:15.649 --> 15:17.217
Oh, don’t mention it.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.619
Don’t worry, I won’t.

15:18.652 --> 15:20.621
If dad knew that you
cheated and lost on purpose

15:20.654 --> 15:22.488
he’d be very upset.

15:22.523 --> 15:23.990
Thanks.

15:26.627 --> 15:28.361
Well, hey, my shot. Ahem.

15:31.765 --> 15:35.368
Cousin, may I have
a private word with you?

15:35.401 --> 15:37.370
Not now, Balki.
I have a putt to miss.

15:40.073 --> 15:44.545
Cousin, you told me
I was cheating by winning.

15:44.578 --> 15:48.048
Instead, I’ve been
cheating by losing.

15:48.081 --> 15:50.951
You made me
a cheating loser.

15:52.786 --> 15:57.090
Which, when you think
about it, is really stupid.

15:58.525 --> 16:00.627
But it’s for a good cause.

16:00.661 --> 16:02.262
After I miss this next putt

16:02.295 --> 16:04.064
Mr. Lyons will love me.

16:04.097 --> 16:04.998
Now, let me play.

16:05.031 --> 16:07.233
Well, he won’t be
loving the real you.

16:07.267 --> 16:09.703
The Larry Appleton who
loves raindrops on roses

16:09.736 --> 16:12.606
and whiskers on kittens.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.307
Think about it, cousin.

16:14.340 --> 16:16.309
Someday you may
marry Jennifer.

16:16.342 --> 16:17.410
What are you going to do?

16:17.443 --> 16:20.581
Play bad golf
the rest of your life?

16:20.614 --> 16:22.448
I could live with that.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.385
Well, it’s not going
to stop with golf.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.220
So, I lose a few
hands of bridge

16:27.253 --> 16:28.388
throw a game of checkers

16:28.421 --> 16:30.390
take a dive at Pictionary.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.193
Big deal.

16:33.226 --> 16:36.630
Come on, Larry, it’s all
riding on this last putt.

16:36.663 --> 16:39.099
If you miss it, I win.

16:44.204 --> 16:45.371
Cousin.

16:47.373 --> 16:49.209
This, this reminds
me of something

16:49.242 --> 16:51.177
that once
happened on Mypos.

16:53.346 --> 16:57.383
Every Friday, Devo the Butcher
used to give free soup bones

16:57.417 --> 16:59.520
to all the widows
in the village.

16:59.553 --> 17:01.822
So, every Friday
Uncle Thriftos

17:01.855 --> 17:05.791
used to dress up as a widow
to get free soup bones.

17:05.826 --> 17:08.294
Everything was fine
until the butcher

17:08.328 --> 17:09.395
fell in love with him

17:09.429 --> 17:11.698
and asked him
to go out dancing.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.268
Well, after one date

17:15.300 --> 17:17.838
Uncle Thriftos decided
he had to give up soup

17:17.871 --> 17:20.406
change his name and move
to another village.

17:21.675 --> 17:23.209
Is there a point to this?

17:23.242 --> 17:26.046
Well, of course there is,
don’t be ridiculous.

17:27.848 --> 17:30.651
Cousin, you can pretend
to be someone else

17:30.684 --> 17:32.786
and get free soup bones.

17:32.819 --> 17:34.354
But sooner or later

17:34.387 --> 17:37.090
you have to dance
with the butcher.

17:49.269 --> 17:50.504
Go ahead, Larry.

18:00.246 --> 18:02.248
Way to go, cousin!

18:05.786 --> 18:07.721
I’m proud of you.

18:11.792 --> 18:13.459
Larry, you won.

18:14.728 --> 18:16.697
I just don’t
know you anymore.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.405
[instrumental music]

18:26.540 --> 18:27.874
[knocking on door]

18:27.908 --> 18:29.309
Come in.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.749
Balki, um, is Larry home?

18:35.782 --> 18:38.719
No, but I expect him any minute.

18:38.752 --> 18:40.220
I, uh...

18:40.921 --> 18:42.889
...I want to apologize.

18:43.624 --> 18:45.191
Oh‐h‐h.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.363
I accept.

18:50.396 --> 18:53.266
Balki, he wants
to apologize to Larry.

18:53.299 --> 18:54.400
Oh.

18:54.434 --> 18:55.536
Dad and I
had a long talk

18:55.569 --> 18:57.237
about his temper
on the golf course.

18:57.270 --> 18:59.506
And I admitted that
I asked Larry to lose

18:59.540 --> 19:01.341
so dad wouldn’t
get angry.

19:01.374 --> 19:03.343
I really feel
awful about this.

19:03.376 --> 19:05.478
I mean, I hope Larry
will forgive me.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.384
Jennifer, Mr. Lyons.

19:11.417 --> 19:13.720
Larry, I have
something to say to you.

19:13.754 --> 19:16.189
Well, I have something
I wanna say to you.

19:16.222 --> 19:17.858
There’s something that’s
been really bugging me

19:17.891 --> 19:19.826
and I have to get
it off my chest.

19:19.860 --> 19:20.894
No, you don’t, cousin.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.495
Yes, I have to say this.

19:22.529 --> 19:23.564
Well, you know,
I don’t think you‐‐

19:23.597 --> 19:24.865
Balki. Balki‐‐

19:24.898 --> 19:26.833
‐Listen to him, Larry. Really‐‐
‐We should just sit down and‐‐

19:26.867 --> 19:28.969
Balki, please.
Please! Please!

19:29.002 --> 19:31.304
Just let me do this!

19:38.912 --> 19:41.715
Mr. Lyons, I‐I was
gonna let you win at golf

19:41.748 --> 19:44.751
because I...like
your daughter.

19:44.785 --> 19:46.386
Super. Anyone for coffee?

19:46.419 --> 19:47.588
Balki.

19:47.621 --> 19:48.889
Please.

19:53.493 --> 19:54.895
I could have beaten
the socks off you

19:54.928 --> 19:57.598
but I‐I wanted you to like me.

19:57.631 --> 20:00.233
And now I realize that
what you think of me

20:00.266 --> 20:01.935
shouldn’t be
so important.

20:01.968 --> 20:04.237
What is important is
what Jennifer thinks of me

20:04.270 --> 20:05.839
and what I think of me.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.909
Frankly, sir,
I think you’re

20:08.942 --> 20:09.976
a pompous old duffer

20:10.010 --> 20:12.746
who couldn’t putt his
way out of a paper bag.

20:13.614 --> 20:15.849
Are you finished now?

20:15.882 --> 20:17.818
Yeah, I think that
about covers it.

20:17.851 --> 20:19.786
Now what did
you wanna say?

20:20.921 --> 20:23.223
I wanted
to apologize to you.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.362
You couldn’t
try to stop me?

20:30.597 --> 20:32.899
Cousin, wild turkeys
couldn’t stop you.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.570
Larry, I deserved all that.

20:36.603 --> 20:38.505
Somewhere along the line
I seem to have

20:38.539 --> 20:40.006
lost sight
of the fact that golf

20:40.040 --> 20:42.475
is supposed to be fun.

20:42.509 --> 20:45.546
I’m sorry I acted like
a pompous old duffer.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.949
Well...

20:48.982 --> 20:52.052
...golf does strange
things to people.

20:52.085 --> 20:53.620
It certainly does to me.

20:53.654 --> 20:56.056
Look, next time...

20:56.089 --> 20:58.324
...let’s play for real.

20:58.358 --> 21:00.293
Alright, I’d like that.

21:01.327 --> 21:02.996
It was nice meeting you, Balki.

21:03.029 --> 21:04.965
You really know your way
around a golf course.

21:04.998 --> 21:06.432
Well, thank you very much

21:06.466 --> 21:08.334
but it’s really
not that difficult.

21:08.368 --> 21:10.303
All the holes are numbered.

21:14.808 --> 21:16.777
I’ll have to look
for that next time.

21:16.810 --> 21:17.844
[laughing]

21:17.878 --> 21:19.746
Well, goodbye, everybody.

21:19.780 --> 21:21.081
See you upstairs, Jen.

21:21.114 --> 21:22.583
Goodbye, sir.

21:24.885 --> 21:26.753
Oh, I’m proud of you, Larry.

21:26.787 --> 21:29.623
It was wonderful the way
you stood up to my father.

21:43.604 --> 21:45.739
I could call your mother
and give her a piece of my mind.

21:47.140 --> 21:50.010
That’s okay, Larry.

21:50.043 --> 21:52.713
Well, I’ll, um...
see you tomorrow.

21:53.647 --> 21:55.816
‐Bye‐bye.
‐Bye, Balki.

21:55.849 --> 21:57.017
Bye.

22:01.154 --> 22:04.357
Cousin, you did
the right thing.

22:04.390 --> 22:06.359
Well, thanks, Balki.

22:07.661 --> 22:10.063
I finally realized that...

22:10.096 --> 22:12.465
...honesty is the best policy.

22:12.498 --> 22:15.401
Well, then maybe
a little bit of me

22:15.435 --> 22:17.370
is rubbing off on you.

22:18.505 --> 22:21.575
You know,
this...truth stuff

22:21.608 --> 22:24.077
works like gangbusters.

22:25.445 --> 22:27.981
I mean, women
really go for it.

22:32.118 --> 22:35.055
