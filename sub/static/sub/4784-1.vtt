01:20.247 --> 01:22.082
- Fire!
- Stand back!

01:22.416 --> 01:25.127
In the woods, boys, in the woods!

01:25.335 --> 01:28.881
- Fire!
- Let's go! Ride!

01:38.265 --> 01:40.142
Fall back!

01:45.189 --> 01:46.440
You okay?

01:46.690 --> 01:48.525
Come on, Bob!
This way!

01:48.775 --> 01:50.944
Hey, you all right?

01:57.534 --> 01:59.786
Gatling! They got a Gatling.

02:00.037 --> 02:04.499
Goddamn it, Cole! This stopped
being fun about two years ago.

02:04.708 --> 02:07.669
Move that wagon!

02:11.298 --> 02:14.635
- Down!
- Fire!

02:17.888 --> 02:19.640
Cole, Bob, you okay?

02:19.848 --> 02:23.101
Takes more than a cannon
to kill the Youngers.

02:23.352 --> 02:29.149
- The cannon's doing a good job, Cole!
- Some Indian tracker you are, Tom.

02:29.358 --> 02:32.319
You pay me to find Bluecoats.
There they are.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.571
- Get me James.
- Jesse?

02:34.821 --> 02:37.574
No, not Jesse. The one that can shoot.

02:37.783 --> 02:40.827
- Frank!
- Frank!

02:41.495 --> 02:42.746
Hold your ground!

02:42.955 --> 02:44.790
Frank, up front!

02:44.998 --> 02:48.126
Jesse, watch your back.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.923
Watch your heads, boys.

02:59.471 --> 03:02.349
- Cannon or Gatling?
- Fire!

03:02.599 --> 03:04.726
- Cannon!
- Cannon.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.632
- Where you been?
- What's up?

03:35.841 --> 03:37.009
Nothing really.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.803
When I put my head up,
they shoot at me.

03:40.012 --> 03:44.349
- So, we got a plan?
- My plan of pissing myself is working.

03:44.558 --> 03:47.603
I can hit those boys.
We need a distraction.

03:48.061 --> 03:53.358
A distraction?
Why the hell didn't you just say so?

03:57.821 --> 04:01.325
- He's smiling.
- That's never a good thing.

04:37.819 --> 04:40.113
Get that rider!

05:00.884 --> 05:04.429
- We're coming, Jesse!
- Head out!

05:05.013 --> 05:09.309
Take the hill! Charge!

05:31.081 --> 05:33.500
Pull back!

05:46.513 --> 05:48.056
Come on!

06:09.995 --> 06:13.957
Go on, get. Get!

06:24.468 --> 06:27.304
Go on! Go on!

06:37.814 --> 06:40.692
- Distracting enough?
- They hardly noticed.

06:40.943 --> 06:43.612
- I could have done more?
- Uh-huh!

06:43.862 --> 06:47.950
- Such as?
- You could have worn a woman's bonnet.

06:48.158 --> 06:51.119
- That would've made an impression.
- I figure.

06:51.370 --> 06:57.000
By the time you figure out stuff,
I'm already finished doing it.

06:57.209 --> 07:01.839
You're always doing stuff
before I'm finished figuring it out.

07:02.214 --> 07:06.343
Goddamn, boy!
Wait till we get to Missouri.

07:06.593 --> 07:10.931
Tell them gals about how
Jesse James charged the Union Army.

07:11.181 --> 07:16.728
- He keeps that up, he'll outrank you.
- I'll still be better-looking, right?

07:16.979 --> 07:19.147
Let's meet on that south road.

07:19.356 --> 07:24.278
See if we can get those Yankees
Jesse here scared off.

07:24.528 --> 07:27.614
- Ride with me, cousin.
- I could use the walk.

07:27.865 --> 07:32.160
All right. We'll have
horses waiting for you at the road.

07:32.369 --> 07:35.289
All right, Rangers, let's ride!

07:36.748 --> 07:40.210
I would sound stupid
saying something like that.

07:53.599 --> 07:54.641
Where you going?

07:54.850 --> 07:58.103
- There's Yankees back there.
- War's over.

07:58.312 --> 08:01.565
General Lee surrendered yesterday
at Appomattox.

08:02.274 --> 08:05.944
- Yesterday.
- Somebody better tell the Yankees!

08:06.236 --> 08:11.450
- What do you reckon, cousin?
- Home. Cole, we go home.

08:11.867 --> 08:17.706
We ride like hell and God help any
fool who comes between me and my farm.

08:17.915 --> 08:20.542
That's the best plan I heard all war.

08:20.751 --> 08:23.086
Well, boys, let's ride!

09:40.497 --> 09:44.710
- Hello, Liberty, Missouri!
- Let's go home, back to our farms.

09:44.918 --> 09:49.089
Planting corn, harvesting corn,
eating corn.

09:49.298 --> 09:50.924
Corn gonna shoot me?

09:51.133 --> 09:54.386
- Then I love it.
- Let's go!

10:03.437 --> 10:05.230
We got problems.

10:05.439 --> 10:09.026
Got a garrison in town.
We're in occupied territory.

10:09.234 --> 10:11.987
- Hands off your hip.
- Are you scared?

10:12.196 --> 10:15.199
Pick your fights. You taught me that.

10:26.084 --> 10:29.630
- Jesus, mercy.
- That's Charlie Higgins.

10:30.631 --> 10:33.634
- I'm cutting him down.
- Not now, Cole.

10:33.884 --> 10:37.387
- What's wrong with you?
- Lf we have to kill them...

10:37.638 --> 10:39.473
...I don't wanna warn them.

10:39.681 --> 10:42.726
I wanna make sure Jim
and the girls are okay.

10:42.935 --> 10:47.564
Stop by and tell our ma we're fine.
We'll see Doc Mimms.

11:07.459 --> 11:10.879
Excuse me, sir,
we're here for the doctor.

11:12.464 --> 11:16.176
- Jesse. Frank.
- Zerelda?

11:16.426 --> 11:19.638
- Little Zee Mimms?
- You were little Jesse James.

11:19.847 --> 11:25.727
Yeah, but you got big!
I mean, Zee, you aged!

11:25.936 --> 11:29.231
I mean, in a good way,
you got big and older.

11:29.439 --> 11:32.901
- Frank, say something.
- No, you're doing just fine.

11:33.110 --> 11:36.780
- Frank. Jesse.
- Daddy.

11:39.283 --> 11:43.787
- Where's Web?
- He rode right into them, screaming.

11:44.288 --> 11:47.791
- Web did that?
- He jumped his horse over our heads.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.919
Killed 12 before they
knew what hit them.

11:51.128 --> 11:56.383
- Took out a Gatling gun and a cannon.
- Saved all our lives, doc.

11:56.592 --> 12:01.597
None of the Liberty boys would've
come home if not for Web. God's truth.

12:01.847 --> 12:04.892
- Web died fighting?
- Web died a hero.

12:05.642 --> 12:08.729
But still died.

12:08.979 --> 12:13.066
Doc, if there's anything we can do,
we want to help.

12:13.275 --> 12:17.362
Think about yourselves.
Don't end up like Charlie Higgins.

12:17.613 --> 12:20.199
They found out he was a
Quantrill Raider.

12:20.449 --> 12:25.162
They arrested him, tried him by
military tribunal and hanged him.

12:25.370 --> 12:30.417
- But there's general amnesty.
- Not if you rode in a partisan band.

12:30.667 --> 12:34.421
You're in more danger
because you've got a farm.

12:34.630 --> 12:38.759
Railroad men come in offering
to buy land. Nobody sells.

12:39.218 --> 12:43.305
So the army starts hanging men
who own farms for treason.

12:43.555 --> 12:45.807
All we've thought about is home.

12:46.517 --> 12:49.811
I'll kill anyone who tries
to get me off my farm.

12:50.020 --> 12:55.234
If I have to go to war with the
railroad to stay, it's fine by me.

12:55.484 --> 12:57.236
Let's think about this.

12:57.444 --> 13:02.950
- Lf we have a good story, we're okay.
- What story are they gonna believe?

13:03.200 --> 13:06.703
You were in General Hood's
Texas Army...

13:06.954 --> 13:10.832
...until Sharpsburg, then were
assigned to Jeb Stuart's cavalry...

13:11.083 --> 13:14.294
...until you surrendered in Tennessee.

13:15.045 --> 13:19.800
- That just might work.
- Yeah, that might just work.

13:20.092 --> 13:23.345
Now go on and see your ma.

13:23.595 --> 13:26.306
She'll be glad to see her sons alive.

13:26.557 --> 13:30.644
And for her sake, stay that way.

13:38.819 --> 13:43.073
Thanks for everything.
Especially the story you told.

13:43.323 --> 13:46.743
- Look, Zee...
- I'm going to go cry now.

13:54.835 --> 13:58.839
- Zerelda became a hell of a woman.
- Oh, yeah.

13:59.089 --> 14:01.508
- "Big and older."
- Shut up, Frank.

14:01.717 --> 14:02.968
You're a charmer.

14:03.177 --> 14:06.722
- I'll shoot you.
- Next time, try "fat and haggard."

14:15.147 --> 14:17.900
My boys! My boys!

14:18.108 --> 14:22.154
My boys! My boys are alive! Oh, God!

14:22.362 --> 14:26.992
- Praise God, you're alive!
- Not if you don't ease up a bit, Ma.

14:29.119 --> 14:31.413
- Did you kill Yankees?
- A few.

14:31.622 --> 14:33.248
- Say your prayers?
- Yes.

14:33.498 --> 14:37.002
Good. Come inside and wash
your hands for dinner.

14:37.252 --> 14:40.714
- Ma, you look so good.
- No, you look great!

14:42.382 --> 14:45.302
Look at Jimmy Younger,
all grown up.

14:45.511 --> 14:47.888
- How you doing?
- All right.

14:48.096 --> 14:51.558
- Your ma made us eat.
- That was two hours ago.

14:51.767 --> 14:53.268
I don't see clean plates.

14:53.477 --> 14:58.148
- Thanks for accepting Tom.
- He's Christian and killed Yankees.

14:58.357 --> 15:03.862
- Jesus told me that made him okay.
- She's still talking to Jesus.

15:04.071 --> 15:07.824
- What worries me is, he's talking back.
- I heard that.

15:09.284 --> 15:12.204
- Come on, Frank.
- You play me that.

15:15.999 --> 15:19.086
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?

15:19.294 --> 15:21.588
She got two, don't she?

15:21.797 --> 15:24.216
- I think one's glass.
- Which one?

15:24.424 --> 15:27.052
- The right or the left?
- The brown one.

15:27.261 --> 15:32.057
Don't make me tell the town about
the fella you screwed in Atlanta.

15:32.307 --> 15:33.642
Talking to me?

15:33.851 --> 15:36.228
- That dance-hall girl at Bunny's?
- Yes.

15:36.436 --> 15:39.314
Sadie was a beautiful woman.
Not a man!

15:39.523 --> 15:42.317
- She had a nice mustache.
- More than that.

15:42.526 --> 15:45.195
- She was European.
- All right.

15:45.445 --> 15:48.949
I'll admit Sadie's a woman,
if you stop about my Zee.

15:49.157 --> 15:50.701
- "My Zee"?
- Your Zee?

15:52.035 --> 15:54.162
From women 's eyes
This doctrine I derive

15:54.413 --> 15:57.833
They sparkle still
The right Promethean fire

15:58.041 --> 16:01.003
They are the books, the arts
The academes

16:01.211 --> 16:04.548
That show, contain and nourish
All the world

16:04.756 --> 16:08.218
I don't know what you said,
but it sounded nice.

16:08.427 --> 16:11.763
That's Shakespeare.
Now, he's European.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.142
Write that down,
so I can say it to Zee?

16:15.350 --> 16:18.729
- I'll send you a telegram.
- Thanks, brother.

16:18.937 --> 16:23.734
- Thanks for the help, Cole.
- You did plenty over at our place.

16:24.443 --> 16:27.613
- You miss it, don't you?
- What, the war?

16:27.821 --> 16:29.781
Hell, no.

16:29.990 --> 16:32.534
I miss things about it, but...

16:32.784 --> 16:34.828
- It was exciting.
- Yeah.

16:35.078 --> 16:38.248
It was a lot of killing.
Why miss that?

16:38.624 --> 16:43.378
Because we were good at it.
Shoot, we were great at it.

16:43.629 --> 16:49.301
Tell anybody this and I'll kill you.
You know I'm the toughest man in town.

16:49.510 --> 16:53.764
But you are one terrifying
son of a bitch with guns.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.897
Boys.

17:07.986 --> 17:10.071
Howdy, folks, how are you?

17:10.739 --> 17:12.366
- Howdy?
- Easterners.

17:12.616 --> 17:14.326
Fine, thank you, sir.

17:14.535 --> 17:17.788
I'm Rollin H. Parker,
emissary to Thaddeus Rains...

17:18.038 --> 17:20.665
...president of Rock
Northern Railroad.

17:20.915 --> 17:23.292
This is Allan Pinkerton...

17:23.502 --> 17:27.756
...founder of the Secret Service
and under contract to Mr. Rains.

17:28.006 --> 17:32.052
As you no doubt heard,
our railroad's moving west.

17:32.261 --> 17:35.180
Well, east would put you underwater.

17:36.932 --> 17:40.102
Moving west to open
the frontier to folks.

17:40.310 --> 17:43.939
Your acreage is located on
the proposed right of way.

17:44.147 --> 17:50.028
I am here to get your signature
on this land-sale contract.

17:50.946 --> 17:54.491
And I'm authorized to pay you two
dollars an acre.

17:54.741 --> 17:55.951
Two dollars?

17:56.159 --> 18:01.790
The price was set by the Department of
the Interior of the U.S. Government.

18:01.999 --> 18:05.711
- This land ain't for sale.
- I understand how you feel.

18:05.919 --> 18:10.674
You've made a lovely home here,
but it isn't up to me or you.

18:10.883 --> 18:14.428
You familiar with the right
of eminent domain?

18:14.636 --> 18:16.763
Yeah, I am. What about it?

18:17.806 --> 18:20.934
This land's about to be condemned.

18:21.810 --> 18:24.479
You see, I'm doing you folks a favor.

18:24.688 --> 18:27.983
Two dollars an acre
is a one-time-only deal.

18:28.192 --> 18:30.235
After today, the price drops.

18:30.444 --> 18:34.698
If I were you, I'd sign the contract
and we'll be on our way.

18:36.033 --> 18:37.534
Good day, Mr. Parker.

18:37.743 --> 18:42.831
You can tell Mr. Thaddeus Rains to put
this where the sun don't shine.

18:43.540 --> 18:45.751
Shakespeare.

18:48.337 --> 18:52.257
I don't think you understand.

18:52.508 --> 18:55.260
You don't have a choice.

18:57.471 --> 19:01.767
Ma'am, I think that you should
search your heart here...

19:01.975 --> 19:05.062
...and try to do the right thing.

19:06.063 --> 19:08.899
Let me ask the Lord.

19:18.784 --> 19:23.539
The Lord says to bury them out back.
Nobody will find them.

19:23.747 --> 19:27.000
- Somebody's in a vengeful mood.
- Let them go.

19:27.209 --> 19:30.504
- We'll bury them next time.
- Oh, all right.

19:30.712 --> 19:32.673
Now, ma'am...

19:36.718 --> 19:40.180
You folks are making
a serious mistake here.

19:46.937 --> 19:49.356
Nicely played.

19:56.738 --> 19:58.824
Tell them what you told me.

19:59.032 --> 20:04.413
I checked the court documents for the
rail bed. They don't need our land.

20:04.663 --> 20:08.041
They're using as much land
as they can.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.544
Floor recognizes Clell Miller.

20:10.752 --> 20:14.173
They say if we don't sell,
we'll end up with nothing.

20:14.381 --> 20:18.802
- Only if we don't stick together.
- Loni Packwood.

20:19.678 --> 20:22.764
I say this is the last straw.

20:23.015 --> 20:27.978
I came back from the war.
My farm was burned down.

20:28.187 --> 20:33.609
My cows was dead. And now my wife's
run off with my cousin Jeb.

20:33.859 --> 20:38.155
That son of a bitch. He took my dog!

20:38.363 --> 20:42.159
Loni. About the railroad.

20:42.409 --> 20:45.245
He took my dog!

20:45.621 --> 20:48.790
- They got Cole!
- He came to our house.

20:48.999 --> 20:51.919
Figured you'd all want to hear this.

20:53.462 --> 20:57.257
They came and made the same offer
they made you folks.

20:57.466 --> 21:00.302
My brother Jim tried
to chase them off.

21:00.511 --> 21:03.931
A detective hit him in the head
and knocked him out.

21:04.139 --> 21:07.142
- Cole lost his temper.
- Oh, no.

21:07.351 --> 21:10.604
- Just a little.
- How many did he kill, Bob?

21:10.979 --> 21:12.773
Two.

21:13.273 --> 21:16.902
Because they worked for
the Department of the Interior...

21:17.110 --> 21:19.238
The Army can hang him.

21:19.446 --> 21:20.697
Tomorrow.

21:20.906 --> 21:23.450
- What do we do?
- Nothing!

21:23.659 --> 21:26.537
You folks will do nothing.
Go home now.

21:26.745 --> 21:28.664
You too, doc.

21:28.872 --> 21:33.335
So you can swear that you know
nothing about what's gonna happen.

21:33.544 --> 21:36.547
- Boys...
- Doc, go home.

21:37.381 --> 21:41.093
They ain't gonna hang
no more Liberty boys.

21:41.301 --> 21:43.428
Go home.

21:48.725 --> 21:53.272
Meeting's adjourned.
Go home, everybody.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.315
Go home.

21:56.024 --> 21:58.151
- I'm staying.
- Me too.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.821
Loni, Clell.

22:01.363 --> 22:04.157
- Couldn't lose him.
- Jim, I said stay home!

22:04.366 --> 22:06.201
It's my fault. I want in.

22:06.410 --> 22:09.705
It was a matter of time before
they hung someone.

22:09.913 --> 22:13.667
- And you're too young.
- Too young?

22:17.087 --> 22:21.341
- I'm as old as you were, going to war.
- And Web too. No.

22:21.550 --> 22:24.136
- You're wasting time.
- Zee, go home.

22:24.344 --> 22:26.346
I was there for the hangings.

22:26.889 --> 22:31.185
You need to know how they do it.
What order they do things in.

22:31.393 --> 22:35.772
If you mess up rescuing Cole because
you won't listen to a woman...

22:35.981 --> 22:39.109
...then damn you all.

22:43.155 --> 22:46.283
All right.

22:46.533 --> 22:50.078
Eight of us against
a Union regiment...

22:50.287 --> 22:56.001
...and Pinkerton detectives on
Main Street in broad daylight.

22:58.795 --> 23:01.715
- He's smiling.
- Is that bad?

23:02.299 --> 23:04.551
Very.

23:17.564 --> 23:22.986
Pinkerton, relax. The Army
has everything well in hand.

23:23.987 --> 23:27.699
Nothing like a hanging to motivate
people to relocate.

23:27.908 --> 23:30.285
It's not my job to relax.

23:30.494 --> 23:34.998
I've got men at every entrance
so no one rides in shooting.

23:35.207 --> 23:39.378
I've got a sharpshooter up
on that rooftop over there...

23:39.586 --> 23:42.089
...just in case.

23:48.720 --> 23:53.684
Be it known that Coleman Younger
be found guilty of treasonable acts...

23:53.892 --> 23:57.437
...against military law
and the Articles of War...

23:57.688 --> 24:00.858
...to be hanged by
the neck until dead.

24:01.066 --> 24:04.820
May God have mercy on his soul.

25:12.888 --> 25:14.932
Brilliant.

25:15.140 --> 25:18.644
Go on, hang him! Pull it!

26:18.787 --> 26:22.624
Sir, are you all right?
Somebody get a doctor!

26:30.174 --> 26:33.343
The bullet left clean,
but he's lost blood.

26:33.552 --> 26:37.306
He's gonna be fine, right, Daddy?

26:37.556 --> 26:39.433
Praying wouldn't hurt.

26:41.602 --> 26:44.771
Who's that? Stay here with him.

26:47.149 --> 26:49.776
We're checking all houses
for a fugitive.

26:50.027 --> 26:53.363
Powell, out back. McCall, first floor.

26:53.572 --> 26:55.407
- I'm going up.
- Who are you?

26:55.616 --> 26:59.578
- Oh, sorry, ma'am.
- Well, I should hope so!

27:01.079 --> 27:04.583
Go! Go.

27:06.710 --> 27:09.838
Jesse, are you awake?

27:10.088 --> 27:12.925
Jesse, is that your hand?

27:20.098 --> 27:23.393
They're gone. What are you...?

27:23.644 --> 27:28.148
- I made them think I was alone.
- Let's hope he pulls through.

27:28.357 --> 27:31.693
I think he's feeling better already.

27:54.508 --> 27:56.552
Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir.

27:56.760 --> 28:00.472
- It's a pleasure to have you.
- I'm pleased to be here.

28:00.681 --> 28:02.599
- Really?
- No, Parker, no!

28:02.808 --> 28:07.646
I'm really not pleased to come
to this godforsaken piece of dirt...

28:07.855 --> 28:11.942
...to discover why you can't evict
a few simple farmers...

28:12.192 --> 28:14.653
...from their pathetic mudholes...

28:14.903 --> 28:17.781
...so I can build the greatest
railroad ever.

28:17.990 --> 28:22.995
- I understand your distress, sir.
- What's going on?

28:24.121 --> 28:29.209
Two weeks ago, we arranged to have
the Army hang a local farmer.

28:29.418 --> 28:32.087
- That's good.
- Unfortunately not, sir.

28:32.671 --> 28:35.966
A group of local thugs
managed to rescue him...

28:36.216 --> 28:41.763
...inspiring resistance. And Mr.
Allan Pinkerton was seriously injured.

28:42.014 --> 28:46.560
Leaving you in charge of operations
until he should return.

28:47.269 --> 28:51.106
A further impediment is that
the garrison's moving on...

28:51.648 --> 28:55.569
...so we don't have that stick
to threaten them with.

28:55.819 --> 28:58.238
You see that as the loss of a tool.

28:58.488 --> 29:02.451
I see a power vacuum to fill.
As we have the most power...

29:02.701 --> 29:05.746
...we may move with impunity.

29:06.371 --> 29:08.457
I see, sir.

29:09.374 --> 29:12.878
I'll get four patrols together
for action tonight.

29:13.128 --> 29:15.047
They'll see what happens...

29:15.297 --> 29:18.842
...when they challenge
the righteousness of progress.

29:19.384 --> 29:20.886
Yes, sir.

29:22.513 --> 29:27.059
- You shouldn't be up.
- It's been two weeks. I'm sick of it.

29:27.309 --> 29:30.437
- You're sick of my company?
- Of course not!

29:31.188 --> 29:35.484
- Teasing you is unfair.
- What you do to me is unfair.

29:35.859 --> 29:39.154
- Well, I shouldn't tease a hero.
- What?

29:39.363 --> 29:42.658
Everybody in the county knows
you rescued Cole.

29:42.908 --> 29:44.993
We're all so proud of you.

29:45.202 --> 29:47.871
And not one farm's been sold since.

29:48.080 --> 29:52.251
Well, that's good, but I wasn't
the only person...

29:52.459 --> 29:54.586
...risking my neck that day.

29:54.837 --> 29:58.590
You're saying I should spend time
with Cole Younger?

29:58.924 --> 30:02.469
With Cole Younger?
No, I never said that.

30:05.472 --> 30:10.310
- You gonna stop loafing and get home?
- What do you think, Frank?

30:10.519 --> 30:15.858
Until Ma has you home so she can fuss
over you, she'll make me miserable.

30:16.108 --> 30:19.611
- What do you say, sir?
- You're pretty much healed.

30:19.862 --> 30:22.906
- Thank you, doc.
- Of course.

30:23.240 --> 30:25.409
Bye, Jesse.

30:27.578 --> 30:29.580
Bye, Zee.

30:31.748 --> 30:35.043
- You're looking more spry.
- Shut up, Frank.

30:35.252 --> 30:40.465
Doc, I was wondering if later
this evening I could come by?

30:40.716 --> 30:42.092
You're always welcome.

30:42.301 --> 30:46.722
Yeah, I know, doc. But I was thinking
maybe I could take Zee out?

30:46.930 --> 30:49.683
Someplace near, with other folk.

30:50.100 --> 30:53.353
Near, you know. Here, but out.

30:54.062 --> 30:55.772
It's fine by me, Jesse.

30:55.981 --> 31:00.235
Don't worry, sir.
I'll make sure they're chaperoned.

31:02.112 --> 31:06.241
That hadn't even occurred to me.
I am deeply in your debt.

31:06.450 --> 31:08.202
You're very welcome, sir.

31:08.452 --> 31:13.498
The Army's leaving, so Cole can stop
hiding and get back to his farm.

31:13.749 --> 31:16.001
We're meeting
at the Younger place.

31:25.135 --> 31:26.345
Leave them alone.

31:26.595 --> 31:28.222
- Cole.
- Clell.

31:28.472 --> 31:30.891
- How are you?
- Hey, John.

31:31.099 --> 31:32.976
Thanks for coming.

31:33.185 --> 31:34.686
- How are you?
- Hey, Cole.

31:34.937 --> 31:38.815
Hey, who's seen how Loni
Packwood is dressed?

31:39.024 --> 31:41.985
Tom, come here, huh?

31:42.236 --> 31:45.072
- Thank you.
- James!

31:45.781 --> 31:47.908
You behave yourselves.

31:48.116 --> 31:51.703
Look. Liberty's favorite son,
come here!

31:52.246 --> 31:54.665
- I won't forget what you did.
- Yeah.

31:54.873 --> 31:56.500
I'm pleased you came.

31:56.708 --> 32:00.337
- Why, thank you.
- I'm very pleased you came with Jesse.

32:00.587 --> 32:04.174
There's a gaggle of girls
hoping to dance with Jesse...

32:04.383 --> 32:07.636
...who'll have to settle
with my many charms.

32:07.845 --> 32:11.849
- Bob, you have no shame.
- Not yet. But I'm hoping.

32:13.559 --> 32:15.102
- Let's dance.
- Okay.

33:04.985 --> 33:08.113
I used to come to this rock
as a kid.

33:08.363 --> 33:11.450
Imagine what life would be like
when I got older.

33:11.700 --> 33:15.579
- You didn't want a farm?
- I thought of being a river pirate.

33:15.829 --> 33:17.289
A river pirate?

33:17.539 --> 33:22.920
- Hand over your jewels, missy.
- Thank God you grew out of that.

33:23.170 --> 33:27.049
- You did grow out of that, didn't you?
- Mostly, yeah.

33:27.257 --> 33:30.594
I mean, it would be all right
for a bachelor.

33:32.679 --> 33:37.476
Are you planning on being a bachelor
your whole life, Jesse James?

33:37.935 --> 33:41.230
Not if I find the right girl.

33:41.438 --> 33:43.357
What's this "right girl" like?

33:43.941 --> 33:49.154
What's she like? She's smart.
She's funny.

33:49.404 --> 33:52.533
She's bossy.
She always makes me think.

33:52.783 --> 33:55.619
She's at least two steps ahead of me.

33:57.162 --> 34:00.415
Where will you find such a girl?

34:04.378 --> 34:06.672
From this doctrine...

34:10.509 --> 34:14.679
From women 's eyes these doctrine...
This doctrine, I derive

34:15.722 --> 34:20.060
They sparkle still like...

34:20.310 --> 34:24.438
...tiny sparkling rocks

34:24.690 --> 34:26.483
"Sparkling rocks"?

34:26.733 --> 34:28.193
Yeah, little ones.

34:28.443 --> 34:31.112
Is this one of Frank's
Shakespeare poems?

34:31.362 --> 34:33.574
Yes, it is.

34:34.908 --> 34:40.455
Were you planning on kissing
me when you finished quoting?

34:40.706 --> 34:44.208
I planned on kissing you
for a very long time.

35:13.113 --> 35:14.406
Bastards!

35:14.656 --> 35:16.950
Come back here and face me!

35:17.159 --> 35:19.661
- Cole, what'd they do?
- Let's get back.

35:19.912 --> 35:22.623
We need some water.
Get some buckets.

35:22.831 --> 35:26.335
- Get buckets!
- Water!

35:29.755 --> 35:32.841
It's the Pinkertons.
It's the railroad.

35:33.091 --> 35:36.345
Then Ma. Ma!

35:37.888 --> 35:39.097
Come on!

35:53.946 --> 35:55.781
Thank God.

35:59.326 --> 36:01.161
Ma!

36:01.495 --> 36:04.081
Ma! Ma!

36:08.460 --> 36:11.004
We know.
We'll get you to Doc Mimms.

36:11.255 --> 36:17.094
You boys take care
of each other.

36:17.302 --> 36:19.263
Ma, Doc Mimms...

36:22.850 --> 36:25.352
Well, look at that.

36:25.853 --> 36:29.940
The good Lord's a bit shorter
than I reckoned.

36:33.485 --> 36:35.362
Ma?

36:54.214 --> 36:59.553
I think we can move on, rebuild.
Make a decent life someplace else.

36:59.761 --> 37:04.349
- I don't care.
- I didn't think you would.

37:05.058 --> 37:10.022
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy
Johnston, the Creeders', Will Hite.

37:10.272 --> 37:15.736
- Sheriff said it's drunk Kansas boys.
- I say we kill some railroad men.

37:15.944 --> 37:19.406
No. This isn't a feud, this is war.

37:19.656 --> 37:23.076
- They've got more men than us.
- What do we do?

37:23.285 --> 37:27.748
We do what we did in the war.
We harass their supply lines.

37:27.998 --> 37:32.294
- We kill their men, they won't care.
- Lf we take money and supplies...

37:32.503 --> 37:35.005
- Exactly.
- That's a good plan, Jesse.

37:35.214 --> 37:38.133
I'll get more men,
and Tom will ride with us.

37:38.342 --> 37:41.386
- Where do we hit?
- I know a gal at the bank.

37:41.595 --> 37:45.849
See if I can get a list of where
the railroad keeps money.

37:58.946 --> 38:03.617
- I'm so sorry, Jesse.
- Me and Frank gotta leave for a while.

38:03.867 --> 38:08.497
But you and I,
we've started something.

38:08.705 --> 38:11.333
I don't know what'll happen if you go.

38:11.583 --> 38:14.336
- Neither do I.
- Just let the law...

38:14.586 --> 38:18.715
Laws don't touch men like
Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.

38:18.924 --> 38:22.511
Whose justice, yours or God's?

38:22.761 --> 38:25.180
When will you stop?

38:28.392 --> 38:31.019
When I send them to their graves.

38:52.666 --> 38:57.004
I have bad news.
The railroad payroll has been stolen.

38:57.254 --> 39:01.258
What do you mean?
The railroad's money is in that safe.

39:03.260 --> 39:05.012
That safe?

39:35.334 --> 39:38.378
Excuse me, sir,
the bank's closed today.

39:38.629 --> 39:40.589
- What?
- It's a bank holiday.

39:40.839 --> 39:45.969
There ain't no dad-burned bank
holiday. Get out of my way!

39:46.220 --> 39:50.474
- This is outrageous. Who are you?
- The James gang.

39:51.642 --> 39:54.144
- The James gang?
- Yeah.

39:54.394 --> 39:57.648
How about the James-Younger gang?

39:58.690 --> 40:00.901
The James-Younger gang.

40:02.069 --> 40:06.323
I'll whop you real good
if you don't get out of my way.

40:06.532 --> 40:07.950
Stop!

40:08.116 --> 40:10.827
Excuse me, sir. It's a bank holiday.

40:11.078 --> 40:14.581
It ain't no bank holiday.
What are you saying?

40:14.831 --> 40:16.792
- What are you doing?
- Go on.

40:17.042 --> 40:19.461
Sir, the safe.

40:19.670 --> 40:22.506
- Ma'am, turn around. Cover your eyes.
- Why?

40:22.756 --> 40:26.760
I'm gonna shoot him
and I don't think you wanna see it.

40:27.928 --> 40:32.015
Hey, the safe. Now.

40:32.432 --> 40:34.059
It ain't no holiday.

40:34.268 --> 40:37.187
- It's a bank holiday.
- You're right, sir.

40:37.437 --> 40:43.151
- Then why can't I go in there?
- On account of that we're robbing it.

40:43.402 --> 40:46.196
Why didn't you say so
in the first place?

40:46.446 --> 40:49.616
It's secret.

40:49.867 --> 40:55.747
- Fine, I'll just wait over here.
- I'd appreciate that.

41:00.502 --> 41:02.337
Go on.

41:04.381 --> 41:06.383
- What the...?
- What is it?

41:06.633 --> 41:10.345
Old Man Tucker is sitting there quiet
outside the bank.

41:10.554 --> 41:11.805
So?

41:12.014 --> 41:16.810
When have you ever known Old Man
Tucker not to be yelling?

41:24.735 --> 41:28.197
- How'd it go in there?
- Fine. How'd it go out here?

41:28.363 --> 41:30.199
We should talk.

41:39.625 --> 41:45.797
You can be smart or stupid about this.
Only one way ends with you breathing.

42:01.897 --> 42:07.361
Just because we're robbing a bank,
there's no reason not to be civil.

42:16.328 --> 42:20.165
- Where the hell were you?
- I had you covered.

42:22.709 --> 42:24.628
- I got 5000.
- I got 3000.

42:24.795 --> 42:28.173
$8000! That's $1000 apiece!

42:28.423 --> 42:30.425
Our luck is finally changing.

42:30.634 --> 42:35.430
These are the farm property rights
the bank held for the railroad.

42:35.639 --> 42:39.226
Pass them over here before something
happens to them.

42:39.434 --> 42:41.270
Whoops.

42:42.396 --> 42:46.400
Settle down.
Not all this money's ours.

42:46.650 --> 42:48.402
No, it was the bank's.

42:48.652 --> 42:52.614
That's why we went
to all the trouble of stealing it.

42:52.865 --> 42:57.661
We ought to give some money
to our hurting neighbors in Liberty.

42:57.911 --> 42:59.913
They didn't risk their necks.

43:00.080 --> 43:04.710
Creating some goodwill
will make it easier to dodge the law.

43:04.960 --> 43:07.129
Frank's being smart about this.

43:07.379 --> 43:10.132
Him reading books
don't make him smart.

43:10.382 --> 43:13.510
- Yeah, it does.
- No, it don't. Stay out of this.

43:13.760 --> 43:17.347
- I think Jesse's got a good idea.
- Jim.

43:19.433 --> 43:24.021
Who put you in charge? I did
a mighty fine job during the war.

43:24.271 --> 43:27.357
And I remember cutting
a noose off you.

43:27.566 --> 43:30.194
That's why you both lead the gang.

43:30.444 --> 43:35.073
Two of you went into that bank.
Two heads are better than one.

43:35.282 --> 43:38.619
All Jesse's doing is making
a suggestion.

43:38.827 --> 43:42.247
We're waiting to hear
what you think, Cole...

43:42.456 --> 43:45.667
...as the other leader of the gang.

43:46.418 --> 43:48.045
That's fine.

43:48.295 --> 43:50.923
- What?
- It's a smart thing to do.

43:51.173 --> 43:52.508
- Cole...
- Hey!

43:52.758 --> 43:58.013
We decide something, that's it.
We're in this for the long haul.

43:58.263 --> 44:03.852
This plan of me and Jesse's,
it's smart. Gives us places to hide.

44:04.061 --> 44:07.606
Then no farmer will shoot us
in our sleep.

44:07.856 --> 44:10.943
We gotta think...
What's that word, Frank?

44:11.193 --> 44:14.738
- Strategically.
- Yeah, thank you.

44:14.988 --> 44:19.701
- Strategically, because this is a war.
- This ain't no war.

44:19.952 --> 44:22.829
What's that?

44:23.080 --> 44:27.209
Nobody paid me no $1000
to fight in a war.

44:31.380 --> 44:35.342
- Tom, are you cheating again?
- I'm broke again.

44:35.592 --> 44:38.887
- Next up, Thaxton Switch.
- That ain't a bank.

44:39.137 --> 44:43.350
It's a construction depot
so it'll have ammo, explosives.

44:43.600 --> 44:46.270
We can take those and
do a bigger job.

44:46.520 --> 44:52.442
- It's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
- I do so want to kill me some of them.

44:52.693 --> 44:54.945
Boys...

44:55.153 --> 44:58.574
...we're famous.
- What's this?

44:58.824 --> 45:02.870
"Fidelity Bank was robbed on Tuesday
by 20 armed men."

45:03.120 --> 45:09.376
Twenty? You mean another gang robbed
the same bank the same day as us?

45:09.626 --> 45:13.463
"The outlaws, calling themselves
the James-Younger gang...

45:13.630 --> 45:17.926
...shot their way out, wounding
the sheriff and three townsfolk.

45:18.177 --> 45:24.683
- The loss is estimated to be $50,000."
- $50,000? More like 50,000 pesos.

45:24.933 --> 45:29.479
"It's believed to be the first
daylight robbery in American history."

45:29.730 --> 45:32.274
- I'll drink to that.
- We made history?

45:32.524 --> 45:35.485
- We should be proud.
- The rest is horseshit.

45:35.736 --> 45:40.699
Next time we're gonna have to set
the record straight ourselves.

45:41.450 --> 45:43.118
Line them up.

45:43.327 --> 45:45.996
- Barkeep.
- Whiskey.

45:53.921 --> 45:57.257
They exchanged fire
with the Pinkerton guards...

45:57.466 --> 46:00.552
...raided the payroll office
and blew the track.

46:00.719 --> 46:05.349
- How much did they get from the safe?
- $35,000 in currency...

46:05.516 --> 46:09.019
...plus the added delay
of miles of destroyed track.

46:09.269 --> 46:13.649
I'll kill them for blowing up
my railway.

46:13.899 --> 46:18.362
- They didn't actually blow the track.
- Who did?

46:19.905 --> 46:23.825
We did. I mean, our men did.

46:24.076 --> 46:28.705
Our workers planted the dynamite,
but they were under duress.

46:28.956 --> 46:32.960
Pinkerton, what is going on here?

46:33.168 --> 46:39.007
You managed to piss off the wrong
bunch of farm boys this time.

46:39.258 --> 46:43.428
- They had to be dealt with.
- By burning down their homes?

46:43.679 --> 46:46.139
You wouldn't have done that?

46:46.390 --> 46:51.520
I would have done that. But I'd make
sure I killed them all first.

46:52.271 --> 46:56.942
- I want them arrested and hanged.
- Do you think a jury in these parts...

46:57.150 --> 47:00.279
...would convict one of their own?
I doubt it.

47:00.529 --> 47:04.992
- We're beginning an interesting game.
- This is no game.

47:05.242 --> 47:10.372
I'm afraid our adversaries
don't agree.

47:11.582 --> 47:16.753
"Rock Island Pacific Railroad Depot
was robbed near St. Louis, Missouri.

47:17.004 --> 47:21.341
The James-Younger gang was outnumbered
by Pinkerton detectives...

47:21.592 --> 47:24.887
...but they were no match
for the guns of the West."

47:25.053 --> 47:27.014
Fine piece of writing.

47:27.181 --> 47:29.850
"The gang destroyed
the Thaxton Switch site...

47:30.017 --> 47:34.271
...meaning that for months,
farmers can sleep without fearing...

47:34.479 --> 47:37.733
...the railroad is coming
to steal their land."

47:37.983 --> 47:40.819
Who wrote this? I'll see them hanged.

47:41.069 --> 47:44.698
That's the best part.

47:46.241 --> 47:49.536
"The foregoing article
was sent to this newspaper...

47:49.786 --> 47:53.874
...reputedly written
by the outlaw Jesse James himself."

48:04.343 --> 48:08.263
- Hey! Look at that.
- What is it?

48:08.472 --> 48:10.432
"Better...

48:10.641 --> 48:13.393
...slow down.

48:13.602 --> 48:17.439
Dynamite ahead.

48:17.940 --> 48:19.483
Too late.

48:19.691 --> 48:22.319
You're dead."

48:38.126 --> 48:43.090
Yes, sir, that was a fine
piece of driving.

48:50.681 --> 48:52.891
Damn.

48:56.687 --> 48:58.522
Thanks, Mr. Williams.

48:58.772 --> 49:02.901
You have to look carefully
at these Yankee $2 bills.

49:03.151 --> 49:07.698
- Could you change this for me? Thanks.
- Certainly, sir.

49:10.367 --> 49:14.580
- I'm sorry, this bill is counterfeit.
- I don't think so.

49:15.497 --> 49:19.042
I'll need all your money
so I can compare.

49:19.293 --> 49:22.713
Scientific method.
I hear it's all the rage.

49:22.963 --> 49:26.133
Yes, you can compare
all of them, Mr...

49:26.383 --> 49:28.552
James.

49:28.760 --> 49:32.723
- Jesse James?
- Yes, sir, it's a terrible sketch.

49:32.931 --> 49:36.226
- That's all I have.
- Thank you. Been a pleasure.

49:36.393 --> 49:38.687
Take care now, you hear?

49:38.937 --> 49:41.273
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

49:41.481 --> 49:44.610
Pinkerton, why can't you catch
these outlaws?

49:44.818 --> 49:46.945
It's early in the game, sir.

49:47.154 --> 49:50.908
Jesse James and I are learning
each other's moves...

49:51.116 --> 49:53.160
...feeling out each other.

49:53.368 --> 49:58.457
I'm losing millions while you play
chess with these farmers.

49:58.665 --> 50:00.000
Hardly farmers.

50:00.209 --> 50:04.505
Each of these men has four
years of fighting experience.

50:04.713 --> 50:08.383
They're disciplined and
have a charismatic leader.

50:09.009 --> 50:12.721
If I were to design the perfect
outlaw band...

50:12.930 --> 50:15.265
...this is the gang I'd create.

50:16.308 --> 50:18.936
So, what can you tell me?

50:19.311 --> 50:22.064
It's going to be a long winter.

50:30.781 --> 50:34.868
Take this road! Come on!

50:37.538 --> 50:41.124
- Come on, boys! Come on!
- Let's go!

50:43.085 --> 50:46.547
Come on, boys!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

51:20.414 --> 51:25.377
- I never thought they would give up.
- They were admirably persistent.

51:25.627 --> 51:27.462
Longest chase we've had.

51:27.713 --> 51:30.591
- Jesse, we gotta have a word.
- Sure.

51:30.841 --> 51:34.553
The newspapers call us
the James-Younger gang.

51:34.803 --> 51:35.971
Yes.

51:36.138 --> 51:40.601
Why not "Younger-James gang"?
We got three Youngers and two James.

51:40.767 --> 51:43.103
I like the James-Younger gang.

51:43.312 --> 51:46.148
I'll beat the piss out of you.
Stay out!

51:46.356 --> 51:50.360
Jimmy's got a point.
The Younger-James gang is confusing.

51:50.611 --> 51:54.781
- How's that, Bob?
- Say we burst into a bank and yell...

51:55.032 --> 51:57.659
..."We're the Younger-James gang!"

51:57.868 --> 52:00.662
People will think,
"Younger-James gang?

52:00.871 --> 52:05.167
Is there an older James gang?
How come we never heard of them?"

52:05.375 --> 52:08.962
They'll think about that instead
of raising their arms.

52:09.171 --> 52:14.426
- Can't argue.
- Do we even have the same mama?

52:14.843 --> 52:17.804
Is anybody hearing me?
I got a little idea.

52:18.013 --> 52:21.642
If I kill you, then Jim,
I'm gonna have no argument.

52:22.351 --> 52:27.814
Pinkerton, it's been eight months.
I see holdups and I see robberies.

52:28.023 --> 52:30.192
I don't see men on nooses.

52:30.442 --> 52:34.404
The James gang's encounters
have been with local law.

52:34.655 --> 52:36.698
They're no match for the gang.

52:36.949 --> 52:41.745
- What about your detectives?
- Listen, you! Shut up.

52:45.832 --> 52:48.377
I have to hunt this man.

52:48.627 --> 52:52.422
I have to get inside this man's mind.

52:52.631 --> 52:55.759
I have to anticipate him.

52:56.009 --> 52:57.636
And that takes time.

52:57.845 --> 53:01.557
Time, time, time.
Oh, I can't believe this.

53:01.765 --> 53:04.184
Would you believe there are towns...

53:04.393 --> 53:07.980
...where the James gang walks openly,
as heroes?

53:08.230 --> 53:12.317
- Now, how can that be?
- Because they are charitable.

53:12.526 --> 53:16.613
Give money to churches, to farmers.

53:16.822 --> 53:21.243
They gave Maddox sharecroppers
enough money to build a school.

53:21.451 --> 53:25.205
- That's my money!
- We should burn that school down.

53:25.414 --> 53:27.374
That's the way to win them
back to our side.

53:29.626 --> 53:33.881
Pinkerton, hundreds of men have died
to build this railroad.

53:34.590 --> 53:37.593
But they did their jobs.

53:37.801 --> 53:41.722
Now, this Jesse James,
that's your job.

53:41.972 --> 53:43.515
Do your job.

53:43.724 --> 53:45.767
Then you let me do my job...

53:45.976 --> 53:49.396
...as I see fit, without interference.

53:49.646 --> 53:54.276
- What can you tell me?
- It's going to be a long spring.

53:54.526 --> 53:59.948
If people would hand it over and not
shoot, there'd be less killing.

54:04.536 --> 54:07.497
- What's that?
- It's my lucky rabbit's foot.

54:07.748 --> 54:11.835
- Took it off that dead fella.
- That one's not working.

54:12.085 --> 54:13.587
What?

54:15.589 --> 54:17.883
Can I have your autograph?

54:19.968 --> 54:22.262
Take this to the West.

54:23.305 --> 54:26.058
Grogan, you take this.
Take these towns.

54:26.266 --> 54:30.812
- You remind me of...
- I can't write this.

54:32.731 --> 54:35.025
Your blue-green eyes remind me...

54:35.275 --> 54:39.112
...of the land and the sky.
- That's it.

54:41.448 --> 54:45.202
You might want to change that to
"I thought of you."

54:45.494 --> 54:49.581
Look, just write the whole thing
yourself.

55:24.366 --> 55:26.994
I think we know how this is gonna go.

55:27.202 --> 55:30.163
One false move and I'll
blow your head off!

55:30.330 --> 55:33.000
- Bob?
- You heard me, Jesse!

55:33.250 --> 55:37.087
You know how crazy I get! Crazy!

55:38.589 --> 55:42.092
- Bob.
- We got a problem, little brother?

55:42.342 --> 55:43.594
Frankly, yeah.

55:43.886 --> 55:48.932
- I'm feeling a little left out.
- It's the wanted posters, right?

55:49.183 --> 55:54.229
Yeah. Obviously, someone's not
standing out in people's minds.

55:55.147 --> 55:57.816
Gents, we're in the middle
of something.

55:58.066 --> 56:00.110
- Bob's upset.
- The posters?

56:00.569 --> 56:03.822
- Yeah.
- Don't say "yeah" in that tone.

56:04.114 --> 56:06.783
- This is important!
- Okay.

56:06.992 --> 56:12.372
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had
to get Mad Bob Younger under control.

56:12.581 --> 56:15.918
Yeah, Bob here will kill a man
for sneezing.

56:16.210 --> 56:19.463
- He's our best shot.
- Better than you, Jesse?

56:19.880 --> 56:25.093
Bob Younger taught me how to shoot.

56:25.385 --> 56:27.262
Now...

56:27.554 --> 56:30.349
...how about we get back
to the robbery?

56:30.766 --> 56:34.895
- Of course.
- That means now, mister!

56:37.064 --> 56:38.315
Now.

56:38.690 --> 56:42.861
- That's it, no more bets.
- One more time. Come on, talk to me!

56:43.111 --> 56:47.407
Talk to me, one more time!
Pretty please!

56:48.033 --> 56:51.620
- Damn, Loni, you're lucky.
- Luckiest man in the West...

56:51.828 --> 56:55.249
...now that I'm riding
with Jesse James!

56:57.709 --> 57:02.172
- You okay, Jesse?
- Drinking whiskey? You're too young.

57:02.923 --> 57:07.636
Not too young to shoot a man,
not too young to drink whiskey.

57:11.640 --> 57:16.186
Jim, you been with a girl yet?

57:16.478 --> 57:21.275
Tonight? I was just getting ready
to go turn on that Younger charm.

57:23.694 --> 57:24.945
Not exactly.

57:25.195 --> 57:29.116
- Been with a girl ever?
- Yeah, I've been with a girl!

57:32.452 --> 57:37.249
I didn't want to get one of them
paid ladies. You know what I mean?

57:37.541 --> 57:38.959
I think so.

57:39.209 --> 57:41.670
You and Frank, Cole, even Bob...

57:42.004 --> 57:45.340
...you get girls because
you're handsome and famous.

57:45.632 --> 57:48.719
They look at me like
I'm your baby brother.

57:51.096 --> 57:56.226
- But don't tell nobody.
- No, I swear. Not a word.

57:59.229 --> 58:02.232
- You okay?
- Tell you what...

58:02.482 --> 58:05.444
...I can't drink good neither.

58:05.694 --> 58:09.781
- I'm gonna go outside and throw up.
- You do that. Hurry.

58:10.282 --> 58:13.952
- Hey, Loni.
- Oh, yeah.

58:14.161 --> 58:15.871
Let's go, sugar-britches.

58:16.121 --> 58:19.708
Just call me Lucky Loni Packwood.

58:19.917 --> 58:23.170
- The new rail route is complete, sir.
- Parker?

58:23.420 --> 58:25.714
- Yes, sir?
- What's that?

58:25.923 --> 58:31.470
That, sir?
Jenkins will explain that.

58:32.554 --> 58:34.848
- Sir.
- Jenkins.

58:35.224 --> 58:38.727
Yes, well, we have done
a financial study...

58:38.977 --> 58:41.980
...of the construction costs...
- Jenkins!

58:43.023 --> 58:46.860
It's cheaper to go around
Jesse James, sir.

58:47.152 --> 58:51.073
Even with the detours
and the extra track...

58:51.365 --> 58:55.035
...it's just cheaper.

58:58.413 --> 59:04.002
So you're telling me that
Jesse James has won?

59:04.711 --> 59:06.421
Oh, no.

59:06.797 --> 59:10.926
No, no, no. See, every three months
the James gang...

59:11.176 --> 59:14.263
...circles back to
Liberty, Missouri...

59:14.513 --> 59:17.766
...and they pull a job beforehand.
- So?

59:18.058 --> 59:22.437
There's only four banks within
that radius they've not robbed.

59:23.272 --> 59:26.441
- Could you put men at all four?
- Don't have to.

59:26.650 --> 59:31.029
I have a better tool at my disposal
for narrowing it down to one.

59:31.238 --> 59:36.201
- What's that?
- An intense hatred of you.

59:38.912 --> 59:40.873
Jesse.

59:42.332 --> 59:45.669
Things a fella's gotta do
to get some respect.

59:45.961 --> 59:50.340
- You deserve it, Bob. It's about time.
- Thank you.

59:51.425 --> 59:56.471
Listen, Jesse, we got a problem.
It's Cole.

59:56.680 --> 01:00:00.893
- He's been full of vinegar lately.
- He's planning a job.

01:00:01.351 --> 01:00:06.398
- He's what?
- I don't wanna start trouble.

01:00:06.607 --> 01:00:09.568
- Tell me.
- Cole, are you sure?

01:00:09.776 --> 01:00:13.614
- It'll be the biggest score yet.
- What will be?

01:00:15.324 --> 01:00:17.701
Hyperion Bank, two days' ride.

01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:22.539
- Got $100,000 in railroad money.
- That's all there? Don't sound right.

01:00:22.748 --> 01:00:26.835
- Lf you read it first, you'd be fine.
- What are you saying?

01:00:27.711 --> 01:00:32.674
I've robbed as many banks as you.
I know this bank. It's an easy job.

01:00:32.925 --> 01:00:36.011
- You're forgetting who's in charge!
- Jesse.

01:00:37.304 --> 01:00:42.100
You're in charge? Huh?
We ain't partners no more, Jesse?

01:00:42.309 --> 01:00:45.646
You tell Cole Younger
when and where to ride?

01:00:45.854 --> 01:00:48.524
- He didn't mean that.
- Siding against me?

01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:54.947
Being with me is being against you?
We don't wanna do that.

01:00:55.155 --> 01:01:01.745
None of us idiots wanna go against
Jesse James, the greatest outlaw ever!

01:01:01.954 --> 01:01:06.500
Paper says without you, we wouldn't
find a goat's ass with a stick!

01:01:06.708 --> 01:01:10.754
- You've been full of yourself lately.
- You think so?

01:01:10.963 --> 01:01:13.257
You all do?

01:01:15.259 --> 01:01:17.219
Frank?

01:01:18.887 --> 01:01:21.431
- One of us gets an idea...
- A bad idea!

01:01:21.598 --> 01:01:24.601
- I got us through the war.
- And nearly got hanged.

01:01:24.768 --> 01:01:26.979
- That's it!
- Cole!

01:01:43.161 --> 01:01:45.122
Boys, we don't want this!

01:01:45.372 --> 01:01:48.333
- I'm a better soldier!
- I'm a better outlaw.

01:01:48.542 --> 01:01:50.335
You both hate the railroad!

01:01:50.627 --> 01:01:53.297
Do it, and Rains never
comes west again!

01:01:53.505 --> 01:01:55.632
- What?
- It's his money!

01:01:55.883 --> 01:02:00.012
He's paying out of his own fortune!
You wanna hurt him?

01:02:00.262 --> 01:02:03.682
- Put your guns down!
- I still don't like it!

01:02:03.891 --> 01:02:08.353
- Let me run the show, General Lee!
- Jesse.

01:02:09.354 --> 01:02:11.648
Jesse!

01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:16.904
You want it?

01:02:19.907 --> 01:02:21.700
All right.

01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:24.161
We hit this bank.

01:02:31.376 --> 01:02:35.464
You'll be smiling once you got
that money in your pocket.

01:02:39.635 --> 01:02:42.971
Cole Younger's gonna make
everyone rich!

01:03:15.587 --> 01:03:18.423
Hands in the air!
We're robbing this bank.

01:03:18.674 --> 01:03:23.053
Do what you're told, nobody dies.
Hands up!

01:03:34.356 --> 01:03:36.233
Oh, no.

01:03:48.537 --> 01:03:49.955
Down!

01:04:30.996 --> 01:04:33.749
- Which one should I shoot first?
- None.

01:04:33.957 --> 01:04:37.044
Jesse, you all right?

01:04:41.423 --> 01:04:44.134
Head for the end of the street!

01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:47.930
- Look!
- Damn.

01:04:54.311 --> 01:04:56.855
Son of a bitch!

01:04:57.981 --> 01:05:00.359
Move, go on!

01:05:03.612 --> 01:05:06.156
- Dozen out back.
- They gonna rush us?

01:05:06.323 --> 01:05:09.201
They're insurance, in case we run.

01:05:11.203 --> 01:05:14.623
Get inside! Get inside! Get in!

01:05:17.125 --> 01:05:19.795
Any ideas, little brother?

01:05:23.966 --> 01:05:25.467
Oh, Lord.

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:53.579
Oh, Lord.

01:06:13.015 --> 01:06:16.101
Oh, shit! Let's get!

01:06:30.908 --> 01:06:32.618
Fire!

01:06:55.599 --> 01:06:57.392
Damn!

01:06:59.895 --> 01:07:02.356
Go, boys! Come on!

01:07:04.983 --> 01:07:08.070
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Come on, boys!

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:10.113
Come on!

01:07:18.330 --> 01:07:20.541
Jimmy!

01:07:35.389 --> 01:07:37.432
Easy. Easy.

01:07:43.772 --> 01:07:45.107
Rest here.

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:47.568
Get some bandages and whiskey.

01:07:48.235 --> 01:07:51.738
- Too young for whiskey.
- We'll make an exception.

01:07:51.989 --> 01:07:54.533
Hey, little brother.
I'm sorry.

01:07:54.825 --> 01:07:57.369
All right, Jim? I'm sorry.

01:07:57.619 --> 01:08:01.123
It was the best time of my life.

01:08:04.334 --> 01:08:06.461
I was famous, you know?

01:08:06.712 --> 01:08:08.338
Yeah.

01:08:38.243 --> 01:08:40.871
- He was just a kid.
- He was old enough.

01:08:41.121 --> 01:08:44.791
A boy riding with the most famous
outlaws in the West.

01:08:44.957 --> 01:08:47.085
How could he say no to that?

01:08:47.377 --> 01:08:52.174
Railroad burned him out too.
You couldn't stop him.

01:08:52.841 --> 01:08:56.886
You're a piss-poor liar
for the smartest man I know.

01:08:57.638 --> 01:09:03.143
A war against the railroad.
What the hell was I thinking?

01:09:03.477 --> 01:09:07.314
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea
at the time.

01:09:08.273 --> 01:09:10.734
- I'm out.
- You're out?

01:09:13.737 --> 01:09:16.823
Blood gets spilled,
you're just gonna quit?

01:09:17.073 --> 01:09:19.201
Who's next, Cole?

01:09:20.035 --> 01:09:23.287
You? Me? Bob?

01:09:23.497 --> 01:09:27.251
- Can't go back, Jesse.
- I ain't telling you what to do.

01:09:27.501 --> 01:09:30.379
Keep riding with Cole,
that's fine by me.

01:09:30.629 --> 01:09:32.589
Frank?

01:09:36.218 --> 01:09:38.511
Get the hell out of here, then.

01:09:38.804 --> 01:09:43.600
Don't come back when you find
you can't farm with a six-gun!

01:10:23.974 --> 01:10:25.601
Jesse.

01:10:28.645 --> 01:10:32.566
What are you thinking?
There are lawmen all over.

01:10:32.816 --> 01:10:36.069
I had to see you.
I'm getting married.

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.614
I don't understand.

01:10:39.448 --> 01:10:45.078
The most wonderful woman in the world.
I can't stop thinking about her.

01:10:47.581 --> 01:10:50.834
Zee, I've quit my outlaw ways.

01:10:52.961 --> 01:10:57.674
Come live in my home,
and in my heart.

01:10:58.133 --> 01:11:00.928
Be my wife.

01:11:12.439 --> 01:11:13.690
Is that a yes?

01:11:21.907 --> 01:11:24.451
I never would've imagined us here.

01:11:24.701 --> 01:11:28.956
That's why I picked it.
We can start a new life here.

01:11:29.206 --> 01:11:33.502
Will you be happy in Florida,
without the excitement?

01:11:33.710 --> 01:11:36.964
I've got you.
You keep me busy.

01:11:37.172 --> 01:11:39.967
We can go to the hotel, check in...

01:11:40.175 --> 01:11:44.179
...then do something I've wanted
to do for a long time.

01:11:44.429 --> 01:11:48.809
Wait a minute. Certain things wait
until after the wedding.

01:11:49.768 --> 01:11:53.897
Driver, change of plans.
Take us to the nearest church.

01:11:54.481 --> 01:11:57.484
"Jesse Woodson James."

01:11:57.734 --> 01:12:01.488
Jesse James.
The Jesse James?

01:12:01.989 --> 01:12:05.742
I could lie, but I want this marriage
to be legal.

01:12:05.951 --> 01:12:09.705
I'm starting a new life
so I'm depending on your...

01:12:09.913 --> 01:12:11.623
- Discretion?
- Discretion.

01:12:11.874 --> 01:12:15.377
- Sir, I'm a man of the cloth...
- Well, thank you.

01:12:15.627 --> 01:12:19.673
...who needs to repair
a leaky church roof.

01:12:21.967 --> 01:12:23.760
Of course.

01:12:25.721 --> 01:12:29.141
Now let's have a drink.

01:12:29.349 --> 01:12:32.603
- In the church?
- Communion!

01:12:33.103 --> 01:12:34.104
Have a good day.

01:12:35.105 --> 01:12:38.609
Hands in the air!
This is a robbery! Move!

01:12:38.859 --> 01:12:40.569
The safe, now!

01:12:40.819 --> 01:12:43.488
Of course!

01:12:46.033 --> 01:12:49.286
- Sir?
- What?

01:12:49.703 --> 01:12:52.164
Where's Jesse James?

01:12:52.414 --> 01:12:55.667
This here is the Younger gang!
Understand?

01:12:55.918 --> 01:12:59.338
But the Youngers ride
with Jesse James.

01:12:59.588 --> 01:13:02.049
You wanna die?

01:13:02.633 --> 01:13:06.762
Did ride. No more.
You understand?

01:13:07.262 --> 01:13:11.016
- The safe, now! All right?
- All right.

01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:14.019
Jesse James never
went around yelling.

01:13:41.004 --> 01:13:43.048
This is the best score yet!

01:13:43.215 --> 01:13:45.884
Taking too long.
People used to snap to.

01:13:46.134 --> 01:13:49.805
Well, that was because of J...
The gang's reputation.

01:13:50.013 --> 01:13:53.767
If people think Jesse's riding,
we won't get respect.

01:13:53.976 --> 01:13:57.813
We're outlaws.
Not exactly the most respectable job.

01:13:58.063 --> 01:14:01.900
Bob, leave me alone.
All right? Go on.

01:14:05.946 --> 01:14:07.281
What?

01:14:07.573 --> 01:14:11.243
"The life of the James gang
wasn't all killing.

01:14:11.535 --> 01:14:15.038
These young bucks
had a taste for the ladies...

01:14:15.289 --> 01:14:18.876
...especially the handsome,
charismatic Jesse James."

01:14:19.209 --> 01:14:20.460
Beg your pardon?

01:14:20.752 --> 01:14:24.256
"Blazing Guns of the West.
True Stories of Jesse James."

01:14:24.506 --> 01:14:27.384
- Only a dime in the hotel.
- Let me see.

01:14:27.801 --> 01:14:29.428
I'm not finished.

01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:34.349
"When he sauntered into a saloon,
his spurs jangling...

01:14:34.558 --> 01:14:38.812
...Ladies flocked to him
like flies to a candied apple."

01:14:39.021 --> 01:14:40.272
As I said, hmm.

01:14:42.107 --> 01:14:43.817
Now, sweetie...

01:14:44.026 --> 01:14:48.071
...you don't believe them silly
dime novels, do you?

01:14:51.283 --> 01:14:53.243
Swimming.

01:14:53.493 --> 01:14:55.954
Swimming is good.

01:15:18.393 --> 01:15:20.938
Don't turn around.

01:15:21.146 --> 01:15:23.023
What?

01:15:23.815 --> 01:15:27.653
If you don't see it,
then it's not real.

01:15:31.823 --> 01:15:34.034
Jesse James!

01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:41.416
You're under arrest!

01:15:56.974 --> 01:15:59.810
They arrested Jesse!

01:16:02.229 --> 01:16:05.816
- What have you done?
- What's that, Bob?

01:16:06.024 --> 01:16:08.944
What have you done, Cole?

01:16:09.236 --> 01:16:12.114
- I ain't done nothing, Bob.
- Swear.

01:16:16.743 --> 01:16:19.746
Swear on Jimmy's grave.

01:16:26.253 --> 01:16:30.299
Bob, you know Cole would never
do such a thing.

01:16:30.507 --> 01:16:33.385
He and Jesse are best friends.

01:16:33.635 --> 01:16:37.848
Cousins. Blood brothers.

01:16:39.224 --> 01:16:41.518
Bob.

01:16:57.326 --> 01:17:00.329
I'm sorry, Cole.

01:17:30.651 --> 01:17:35.697
- We're moving you tomorrow.
- But I like the presidential suite.

01:17:35.948 --> 01:17:40.827
You'll get a similar room,
but the hotel's in Washington, D.C.

01:17:41.078 --> 01:17:46.458
You won't get a fair trial here,
with a jury of James sympathizers.

01:17:46.667 --> 01:17:50.170
- So I get a jury bought off by Rains?
- That's it.

01:17:51.547 --> 01:17:54.967
- Did you order our houses burned down?
- Not that day.

01:17:55.259 --> 01:17:57.469
I'm guilty of many things...

01:17:57.678 --> 01:18:03.684
...but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains
and Parker.

01:18:06.144 --> 01:18:10.274
- This was you, by the way.
- You almost ended my career.

01:18:10.816 --> 01:18:12.860
Pity.

01:18:14.736 --> 01:18:17.531
We're gonna hang you, you know.

01:18:18.156 --> 01:18:20.450
Yeah, I figured.

01:18:20.951 --> 01:18:23.412
Was it worth it?

01:18:24.037 --> 01:18:27.958
- I should've killed Rains.
- That's what I'd have done.

01:18:28.166 --> 01:18:30.460
Well, I'm not hanged yet.

01:18:30.711 --> 01:18:34.631
You cocky little bastard!

01:18:36.049 --> 01:18:38.343
Oh, you'll miss me.

01:18:38.594 --> 01:18:42.973
No. I'll hang you.

01:18:43.223 --> 01:18:46.560
But I may miss you a little bit.

01:18:58.697 --> 01:19:00.407
Come on, you!

01:19:02.743 --> 01:19:04.953
So this is he.

01:19:05.162 --> 01:19:06.413
I remember you.

01:19:06.622 --> 01:19:09.875
You're Parker. I remember you too.

01:19:10.167 --> 01:19:13.921
- You killed my ma.
- How did you know?

01:19:14.546 --> 01:19:16.924
Not such a menace now, is he?

01:19:17.174 --> 01:19:20.177
Well, I could always
take off his irons.

01:19:20.385 --> 01:19:25.098
You cost me millions and months
of delays in construction.

01:19:25.307 --> 01:19:29.228
I wish I could hang you
every morning for a century.

01:19:31.146 --> 01:19:33.106
How do you like that?

01:19:33.315 --> 01:19:37.694
My father had it made
when he started this railroad.

01:19:38.153 --> 01:19:42.950
I'll give it to my son,
and he'll give it to his son.

01:19:43.242 --> 01:19:48.789
The right sort of men will always
run this country. Not your sort.

01:19:48.997 --> 01:19:53.877
You'll always suffer.
And you haven't changed anything.

01:19:54.127 --> 01:19:57.548
I made you think twice
about burning homes down.

01:19:57.798 --> 01:20:01.718
- We'll speak in Washington.
- You're on the same train?

01:20:02.845 --> 01:20:07.307
Well, I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna have to pay you a visit.

01:20:07.516 --> 01:20:10.394
- Big words.
- It's a promise.

01:20:10.853 --> 01:20:13.146
Get him on board.

01:20:16.275 --> 01:20:17.860
Open up!

01:20:19.486 --> 01:20:22.281
- Hook him up.
- Come with me, boy.

01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:33.834
Take him back.

01:20:34.042 --> 01:20:37.129
Now, your guns.

01:20:37.546 --> 01:20:40.632
I don't like it.
We can handle him.

01:20:40.924 --> 01:20:46.680
In the last 10 seconds, he could've
grabbed your gun at least three times!

01:20:47.389 --> 01:20:50.392
If he lays a finger
on one of your guns...

01:20:50.642 --> 01:20:55.272
...you are all, and I mean all,
dead men!

01:20:55.939 --> 01:20:57.900
He's chained up.

01:20:58.150 --> 01:21:03.280
I'll put that on your tombstone.
Your guns!

01:21:52.371 --> 01:21:54.748
Give me two good cards.

01:21:55.832 --> 01:21:58.293
Everybody, ante up.

01:21:59.711 --> 01:22:01.588
Hey, stupid!

01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:03.841
Yeah, you!

01:22:04.216 --> 01:22:07.636
Glad to see you know your name,
you dumb shit!

01:22:14.309 --> 01:22:17.312
- What are you saying, boy?
- I recognize you.

01:22:17.521 --> 01:22:19.064
How?

01:22:19.273 --> 01:22:22.776
You left by the front door
as I came in the back.

01:22:23.026 --> 01:22:26.280
You shut up now, boy!

01:22:28.073 --> 01:22:32.160
Yeah. Your wife said
you did that to her too.

01:22:33.203 --> 01:22:35.330
Will this shut you up?

01:22:35.581 --> 01:22:37.708
I can do this without the gun.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.377
It just makes things easier.

01:23:31.261 --> 01:23:33.222
What the hell is that?

01:23:33.472 --> 01:23:38.185
Vengeance!
Outside! Get up on the roof!

01:23:38.435 --> 01:23:41.688
You stay put, gentlemen.

01:24:20.686 --> 01:24:24.189
- Nice shot.
- Thank you.

01:24:24.439 --> 01:24:27.192
Now go get my husband!

01:24:41.623 --> 01:24:45.627
- There's only four of them!
- Move, you fools! Move!

01:25:51.693 --> 01:25:53.320
Come quickly! This way.

01:26:03.455 --> 01:26:05.332
Do it!

01:26:11.463 --> 01:26:14.633
That was for my ma.
This is for everybody else.

01:26:14.883 --> 01:26:17.344
No, they'll set the Army on you!

01:26:17.553 --> 01:26:21.223
You and your wife.

01:26:32.234 --> 01:26:37.197
That is a nice watch you got there.
Hand it over.

01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:41.410
If I can get you today...

01:26:41.618 --> 01:26:46.415
...then you damn sure know
I can kill you anytime I want.

01:26:46.623 --> 01:26:50.627
Sleep on that for the next 20 years.
Give it to me!

01:27:02.890 --> 01:27:05.184
Hands up, now!

01:27:11.064 --> 01:27:13.275
Tennessee.

01:27:13.567 --> 01:27:16.111
The railroad has no business there.

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:20.866
Therefore I have no interest
in the state of Tennessee.

01:27:22.951 --> 01:27:24.203
Thank you.

01:27:24.411 --> 01:27:26.872
I'd just as soon kill you...

01:27:27.331 --> 01:27:31.001
...but chasing you takes up
too much of my time.

01:27:31.251 --> 01:27:33.378
Fair enough.

01:27:33.587 --> 01:27:35.881
Jesse James?

01:27:42.387 --> 01:27:44.431
Come on, let's ride!

01:28:01.907 --> 01:28:05.077
- Get arrested again, I'll kill you.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:28:05.327 --> 01:28:08.580
- I blew up a train.
- You're a hell of a woman.

01:28:08.789 --> 01:28:11.959
- Don't swear!
- Yes, ma'am.

01:28:20.133 --> 01:28:23.303
- I missed you, cousin.
- I missed you too.

01:28:23.554 --> 01:28:25.264
You know...

01:28:25.472 --> 01:28:29.935
...when you got caught, they thought
I had something to do with it.

01:28:30.185 --> 01:28:32.646
- Never crossed my mind.
- Good.

01:28:32.896 --> 01:28:35.899
Things changed when you quit the gang.

01:28:36.108 --> 01:28:39.194
- Now I say, "Let's ride."
- He ain't bad at it.

01:28:39.695 --> 01:28:42.573
- It's tough.
- Where'd you get the riders?

01:28:42.823 --> 01:28:46.577
We didn't. Zerelda did.
She makes a hell of an outlaw.

01:28:46.869 --> 01:28:49.329
So, what's the plan, Jesse?

01:28:49.538 --> 01:28:51.665
- We're gonna buy a farm.
- Farm?

01:28:51.832 --> 01:28:55.502
- Down in Tennessee.
- All right.

01:28:57.588 --> 01:29:01.258
Want to ride with the Younger gang
for a while?

01:29:01.508 --> 01:29:03.218
Bye, boys.

01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:05.804
Tom.

01:29:07.681 --> 01:29:10.309
- Tennessee, huh?
- Yeah, I think so.

01:29:10.517 --> 01:29:15.063
- Meet you there in a couple weeks.
- I'll see you soon.

01:29:15.981 --> 01:29:21.111
- Thanks for that distraction.
- Hell, they hardly noticed us.

01:29:21.403 --> 01:29:23.947
- Mrs. James?
- Shall we?

01:29:24.239 --> 01:29:26.700
Shall we, indeed. Frank. Rangers.

01:29:26.992 --> 01:29:29.453
- Tennessee?
- I'll explain on the way.

01:29:29.703 --> 01:29:32.080
All right, boys.

01:29:33.332 --> 01:29:36.168
Let's ride!

01:29:36.543 --> 01:29:38.921
- When were you gonna tell me?
- I did.

01:29:39.129 --> 01:29:40.380
Because I asked.

01:29:40.631 --> 01:29:45.177
- Damn, am I ever gonna win with you?
- Don't change the subject.

01:34:30.546 --> 01:34:31.547
