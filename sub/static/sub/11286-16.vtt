WEBVTT

00:02.935 --> 00:04.938
Synclaire, did you proof
these interview questions?

00:05.005 --> 00:07.374
Went over them with
a fine toothed comb.

00:07.441 --> 00:09.377
Bobby Bonilla
of the New York Mets

00:09.444 --> 00:12.882
lose in Connecticut
in a beautiful "reem ouse"?

00:12.949 --> 00:14.183
Shouldn't it say dream house?

00:14.250 --> 00:16.487
My keyboard is broken.
I can't type any words

00:16.554 --> 00:18.289
with the letters G, H or D.

00:18.356 --> 00:21.493
If I have to type the word
Gandhi, I'm in big trouble.

00:22.294 --> 00:24.297
Boss Lady, we need to talk.

00:24.364 --> 00:26.768
I'm out of personalized
note pads.

00:28.102 --> 00:33.043
Russell, the music editor.
Go ahead copy this.

00:34.879 --> 00:37.015
The machine is broken.

00:37.082 --> 00:40.319
Take this screw driver and you
stick it in the back, okay?

00:40.386 --> 00:42.289
Just make sure
you unplug it first.

00:42.356 --> 00:45.827
This is tyranny, an outrage.
And just plain cheap.

00:47.963 --> 00:49.231
Okay, look, you people.

00:49.298 --> 00:52.369
You really need to learn how
to make things last around here.

00:52.436 --> 00:53.905
I mean,
these supplies ain't free.

00:58.344 --> 01:01.322

So, are you upset about
the baseball strike?

01:36.403 --> 01:39.139
Not really. All we wanna do
is get this thing settled

01:39.206 --> 01:40.541
and make the fans happy.

01:40.608 --> 01:43.145
So your not angry about the
owners proposed salary cap?

01:43.212 --> 01:44.481
Those blood suckers!

01:44.547 --> 01:46.483
Hey, Mr. Bonilla.

01:47.851 --> 01:49.854
I'm Synclaire James
from Minnesota.

01:49.921 --> 01:52.658
I know I should be Twins fan
but I like football.

01:52.725 --> 01:55.729
So I root for the Vikings.
My favourite team is Tampa Bay

01:55.796 --> 01:56.864
Although I don't like it.

01:56.931 --> 01:58.566
Anyway, would you
sign my baseball?

01:58.633 --> 02:00.235
It's for my boyfriend Overton.

02:00.302 --> 02:02.111
I'd be happy to.

02:02.178 --> 02:04.113
‐ Great penmanship.
‐ Catholic school.

02:05.816 --> 02:07.118
Anyway..

02:07.185 --> 02:09.687
I mean you guys have been
on strike since August.

02:09.755 --> 02:11.991
What do you do with
all your free time?

02:12.058 --> 02:14.294
Well, I work out,
spend time with my family.

02:14.361 --> 02:16.464
‐ And I have a journal.
‐ Oh, that's intersting.

02:16.530 --> 02:18.934
Shame, shame, shame, Khadijah.

02:19.001 --> 02:23.307
Can't you hear my pocket
screaming for justice?

02:23.374 --> 02:26.244
I was forced to pay
for our business lunch.

02:26.311 --> 02:28.347
Russell, I'm busy right now.

02:28.414 --> 02:31.951
Fine, push me aside for some
overpaid cricket player.

02:34.889 --> 02:36.625
Excuse him, Bobby.

02:36.692 --> 02:38.560
This is Russell.
Our music editor.

02:38.628 --> 02:41.899
And it maybe his last day.

02:41.965 --> 02:43.267
Go Mets!

02:45.737 --> 02:47.807
So you were telling me
about your journal.

02:47.873 --> 02:49.610
What kinda' stuff
do you write about?

02:49.676 --> 02:51.145
About hanging out
in right field

02:51.212 --> 02:53.448
hitting home runs and
making sure I'm not scratching

02:53.515 --> 02:56.084
myself when the camera's on me.

02:56.151 --> 02:59.256
Hey, have you ever thought
about writing a sports column?

02:59.323 --> 03:01.265
We could call it
"Bobby's Journal."

03:01.332 --> 03:03.401
"Bobby's Journal".

03:03.468 --> 03:05.571
Khadijah, you've got yourself
a sports writer.

03:05.637 --> 03:07.240
Oh, you can start tomorrow.

03:07.307 --> 03:08.308
Thank you.

03:08.375 --> 03:09.677
Hi, Mr. Bonilla.

03:11.512 --> 03:13.382
Could you sign another
autograph for me?

03:13.448 --> 03:15.418
This time it's for
my granny James.

03:15.485 --> 03:17.588
And would you sign it,
"Love Hank Aaron."

03:17.654 --> 03:19.757
He's her favourite player.

03:27.835 --> 03:30.606
Okay, what's with the computer?

03:30.672 --> 03:32.909
Your latest accessory?

03:32.975 --> 03:36.346
I happen to be doing
inventory for the botique.

03:36.413 --> 03:39.418
It's just a coincidence
that it matches my outfit.

03:42.855 --> 03:46.060
Well, ladies. Fixed the
thermostat in the freezer

03:46.127 --> 03:48.062
and pryed this loose.

03:48.129 --> 03:50.065
What is it?
A cheese ball?

03:52.235 --> 03:53.937
No, turkey gravy.

03:54.003 --> 03:55.005
I'll take it.

03:58.409 --> 04:00.352
This is good.

04:02.622 --> 04:03.891
Hey, people.

04:04.725 --> 04:07.061
Ughh!

04:07.128 --> 04:09.565
Satan's first born.

04:09.632 --> 04:11.201
Hi, dad.

04:12.703 --> 04:14.772
Man, you'd never believe
what happened.

04:14.839 --> 04:16.875
You know Marvin the video clerk?

04:16.942 --> 04:20.613
He just sold his first
screenplay for $250,000.

04:20.680 --> 04:24.685
That should supplement
his hourly wage quite nicely.

04:24.752 --> 04:26.522
Point is, man.
He quit.

04:26.588 --> 04:28.157
So I'm gonna write a screenplay.

04:28.224 --> 04:32.696
I like Wall Street, but I'll
take easy street if I can.

04:32.763 --> 04:34.866
Kyle, I think that
is a great idea.

04:34.932 --> 04:37.336
I have always wanted
to write a screenplay.

04:37.403 --> 04:40.741
A romantic comedy
like "The Body Guard".

04:44.512 --> 04:46.082
That wasn't a comedy.

04:46.149 --> 04:49.119
Everytime I saw Kevin Costner's
haircut, I laughed.

04:51.923 --> 04:53.392
I was thinking more
action adventure.

04:53.459 --> 04:54.793
Oh, please!

04:54.861 --> 04:57.097
Not another one of those movies
where everything explodes

04:57.164 --> 05:00.702
and a bimbo in a bikini breaks
her heel running through woods.

05:00.769 --> 05:03.613
Yeah, and you forget about the
trusty black sidekick

05:03.679 --> 05:06.049
who always gets killed
during openeing credits.

05:08.085 --> 05:11.023
And you know that's
a damn conspiracy.

05:11.089 --> 05:15.194
I say we make it an action
adventure romantic comedy.

05:15.261 --> 05:18.533
Two star crossed lovers
travelling to South Dakota

05:18.599 --> 05:21.102
and they're being chased
by this android body builder

05:21.169 --> 05:23.573
from the future
bent on their destruction.

05:25.142 --> 05:27.178
You really thought
about this haven't you.

05:27.245 --> 05:28.680
Uh‐huh.

05:30.783 --> 05:32.151
I'm doing this myself.

05:32.218 --> 05:33.987
Oh, come on, Kyle.

05:34.054 --> 05:36.390
Now, who would you
bounce ideas off of? Max?

05:36.457 --> 05:38.126
Who thinks that Freddie Krueger

05:38.193 --> 05:39.995
is the quintessential
leading man?

05:40.062 --> 05:41.430
Uh! Uh! Uh!

05:41.497 --> 05:46.437
What I said was Freddie Kreuger
is the essence of every man.

05:49.007 --> 05:51.578
I don't know, Regine. Look,
I usually work better alone.

05:51.644 --> 05:54.014
Oh, well, we're not talking
about your sex life.

05:58.087 --> 06:00.190
‐ Alright, alright.
‐ Okay.

06:00.256 --> 06:02.065
‐ Alright, I'll tell you what.
‐ Uh‐huh.

06:02.132 --> 06:03.835
I'll do all the typing.

06:03.901 --> 06:05.803
‐ Alright, welcome aboard.
‐ Okay.

06:05.871 --> 06:08.942
Look, stop nagging me about
that dang old keyboard.

06:09.008 --> 06:11.511
Hey, guess who's gonna write
a sports column for Flavour?

06:11.578 --> 06:12.813
(all)
Bobby Bonilla.

06:15.016 --> 06:16.953
I had to tell somebody.

06:18.421 --> 06:21.325
I got him to sign this
for you today, snack cake.

06:21.392 --> 06:23.327
Oh, thank you, lava lips.

06:24.896 --> 06:27.066
I'll put it right next
to my autographed

06:27.133 --> 06:29.069
Pet Boys torque wrench.

06:30.504 --> 06:32.740
Having Bobby write a column
for Flavour might be

06:32.807 --> 06:34.309
just the thing to boost sales.

06:34.376 --> 06:36.379
Yeah, maybe we'll see some
improvement at Flavour.

06:36.445 --> 06:39.750
Like a new copier, some staple
removers, an aquarium.

06:41.452 --> 06:43.722
Tropical fish make
the best office pets.

06:43.789 --> 06:46.092
They die so fast,
you never get attached.

06:47.895 --> 06:50.131
Stop spending my money
before I even make it.

06:50.198 --> 06:51.466
Don't be so cheap.

06:51.533 --> 06:54.670
People are beginning to talk
and not so far behind your back.

06:54.737 --> 06:58.109
Look, I'm not cheap. I'm frugal.

06:58.175 --> 07:02.821
Uh‐huh, miss frugal
put coin boxes on the bathrooms.

07:02.888 --> 07:04.658
It slows down
the number of trips

07:04.724 --> 07:06.160
and increases productivity.

07:06.226 --> 07:07.327
Oh!

07:07.395 --> 07:09.330
‐ Did you hear that?
‐ What?

07:09.397 --> 07:10.699
Conflict.

07:10.766 --> 07:14.337
Kamalah, the tight fisted
editor of Taste

07:14.404 --> 07:17.141
won't give into the demands
of her child‐like cousin.

07:18.943 --> 07:20.946
Well, it needs a villain.

07:25.086 --> 07:27.389
Maxilla! The shrew.

07:29.324 --> 07:30.593
Okay, okay, okay.

07:30.659 --> 07:34.632
She walk..No, no,
she limps in, hunched over

07:34.699 --> 07:37.402
Ah! That's so..
Ha‐ha‐ha.

07:37.469 --> 07:40.740
Distroying everything
in her path with her breath.

07:40.807 --> 07:43.744
[screaming]

07:45.547 --> 07:49.018
Nice job, Bobby. But I think
you should avoid statements like

07:49.084 --> 07:51.755
"The major league owners are
capitalistic pigs"

07:51.822 --> 07:54.492
"who treat the players like
puppets and hoard the profits"

07:55.828 --> 07:57.696
That was Russell's idea.

07:57.763 --> 08:00.267
Khadijah, you have a meeting
with the printer, 15 minutes

08:00.334 --> 08:01.709
time to skedaddle.

08:01.776 --> 08:04.913
And, Bobby, could you
sign this for me please?

08:04.980 --> 08:07.917
Sure, who should
I make this out to?

08:07.984 --> 08:11.355
The U. S Government.
It's a W‐4.

08:11.422 --> 08:13.358
Being all fan happy aren't you?

08:16.161 --> 08:18.364
Oh, cheese on bread!

08:18.432 --> 08:20.567
Damn thing broke again.

08:20.635 --> 08:23.005
You see what working
for this goat yard magazine

08:23.071 --> 08:24.940
has done to me?

08:25.007 --> 08:27.877
I'm gonna sell pictures
to my public to survive.

08:27.944 --> 08:30.181
That would be a dollar, please.

08:30.248 --> 08:32.618
Russell, you cannot
be that hard up for money.

08:32.683 --> 08:35.855
Hear me now. I haven't had
a raise in almost two years.

08:35.922 --> 08:39.126
And I've been that big boned
Khadijah form the very beginning

08:41.230 --> 08:42.698
Things are not that bad here.

08:42.765 --> 08:44.734
Oh, sure, we don't
have a health plan.

08:44.801 --> 08:47.304
It costs about 40 cents
to go to the bathroom

08:47.371 --> 08:49.874
But if Khadijah can do something
about it, she would.

08:49.942 --> 08:52.879
You're a such a trusting girl.
Could I hold your wallet?

08:55.182 --> 08:57.117
Bo‐Bo gal.

08:57.885 --> 08:59.320
Hey, Mr. Baseball.

08:59.387 --> 09:01.898
When did the players decide
it was time to strike?

09:01.964 --> 09:04.201
Oh, when the owners refused
to budge we realized

09:04.267 --> 09:06.237
it was time to stand up
for ourselves.

09:06.304 --> 09:08.573
That's right!
I say we strike.

09:08.640 --> 09:11.143
Against Khadijah?
That's not right.

09:11.211 --> 09:13.980
It's justice!
No raise, no work.

09:14.047 --> 09:16.618
No raise, no work!
No raise, no work!

09:16.684 --> 09:18.086
No raise, no work!

09:18.153 --> 09:19.888
No, mon. No, mon.

09:19.955 --> 09:22.592
There's no reason to strike.

09:22.659 --> 09:24.795
Working conditions
are good around here.

09:24.862 --> 09:28.200
Anybody got any change?
I gotta go.

09:28.267 --> 09:31.238
Here's a washer.
It works like a dime.

09:33.975 --> 09:35.444
Forgot my check book.

09:35.510 --> 09:37.079
Khadijah, we should talk.

09:37.146 --> 09:39.449
People are very unhappy
that the equipment doesn't work

09:39.515 --> 09:40.817
and supplies are running low.

09:40.884 --> 09:42.319
You on that again?

09:42.386 --> 09:45.724
It's not just me. We've got lots
of disgruntled employees here.

09:45.791 --> 09:48.427
Lucky for you we don't
work at the post office.

09:49.997 --> 09:51.799
You're lucky to have a job.

09:51.866 --> 09:53.334
Oh, I'm the lucky one?

09:53.401 --> 09:57.940
Oh, I'm the lucky one.
Well, lucky, lucky, lucky me.

09:58.007 --> 09:59.743
What's the matter Synclaire?

09:59.810 --> 10:01.920
Is the cruel boot of management

10:01.986 --> 10:05.224
weighing heavily
on your pretty neck?

10:05.290 --> 10:07.694
Oh, let's just all
get back to work.

10:07.761 --> 10:09.831
You know, Khadijah,
these are just the conditions

10:09.897 --> 10:11.466
that force people to walk.

10:11.533 --> 10:13.135
Synclaire, let's get serious.

10:13.201 --> 10:15.939
You can't stop working
if you never really started.

10:16.005 --> 10:18.008
Oh!

10:18.075 --> 10:19.444
Hey, Bobby?

10:19.510 --> 10:22.781
What's it called when a batter
swings and misses the ball?

10:22.848 --> 10:23.950
A strike.

10:24.016 --> 10:26.286
That's the word.
Strike, set it off!

10:26.353 --> 10:29.390
(all)
Strike! Strike! Strike!

10:35.265 --> 10:37.702
(all)
Strike! Strike! Strike!

10:37.769 --> 10:40.773
Alright!
Alright, okay, alright.

10:40.839 --> 10:43.076
‐ Strike! Strike! Strike!
‐ Alright!

10:43.142 --> 10:45.846
Just a little family spat.
Everything is okay....

10:45.913 --> 10:46.914
...Right, Synclaire?

10:46.981 --> 10:48.449
Oh, no it's not Miss Missy.

10:48.516 --> 10:51.020
You get back to me when
I have a raise

10:51.087 --> 10:53.857
a new keyboard and
some big gold fish.

10:53.924 --> 10:56.728
Synclaire, you know I can't
afford all that stuff right now.

10:56.795 --> 10:58.563
I don't care about finances.

10:58.630 --> 11:00.533
I have mouths to feed.

11:00.600 --> 11:02.543
Russell, you don't have no kids.

11:04.345 --> 11:05.780
But I have women.

11:09.485 --> 11:12.122
I want a raise.
We all want a raise.

11:12.189 --> 11:13.157
We want a raise.

11:13.223 --> 11:15.827
(all)
We want a raise.
We want a raise.

11:15.894 --> 11:17.964
We want a raise.
We want a raise.

11:18.030 --> 11:19.331
This is all your fault.

11:19.399 --> 11:22.035
I guess if you can't work
nobody can work, huh?

11:22.102 --> 11:24.706
Hey, you got it all wrong.
I'm on your side.

11:24.773 --> 11:26.608
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

11:26.676 --> 11:28.311
Let's just all calm down.

11:28.378 --> 11:31.115
If we keep cool heads we can
all settle this reasonably.

11:31.182 --> 11:33.318
There's nothing to settle.

11:33.385 --> 11:37.656
Salaries are gonna have
to stay where they are.

11:37.724 --> 11:39.826
That's a salary cap.

11:39.894 --> 11:41.796
Strike! Strike!

11:41.862 --> 11:45.667
(all)
Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike!

11:45.735 --> 11:48.571
Synclaire! You can't strike.
We're family.

11:48.638 --> 11:51.843
So were Kane and Abel.

11:51.910 --> 11:54.079
Strike! Strike! Strike!

11:54.146 --> 11:56.783
Wait, listen up, everybody.

11:56.850 --> 11:59.721
Strategy meeting
down at Junior's restaurant.

11:59.787 --> 12:02.397
Bobby billionaire's payin'.

12:02.464 --> 12:06.870
(all)
Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike!

12:06.936 --> 12:11.209
(Synclaire)
'Strike! Strike! Strike!
Strike! Go! Strike!'

12:13.880 --> 12:18.319
Hey! Its thing one and thing two
perpetrating the screen writers.

12:18.386 --> 12:19.588
Hey, how's it goin'?

12:19.654 --> 12:21.123
It's goin' great man, get this.

12:21.190 --> 12:23.693
Lyle the stockbroker
slash secret agent

12:23.759 --> 12:26.063
is investing in mutual funds
while chewing his way

12:26.130 --> 12:27.932
through a pair
of stainless steel wrist‐cuffs

12:27.999 --> 12:31.938
as he tries to avert
a thermo‐nuclear meltdown.

12:32.005 --> 12:36.010
While Regina, the clothing
designer slash martial artist

12:36.076 --> 12:39.281
and bride to be,
is matching fabric swatches

12:39.348 --> 12:43.687
with her bridesmaids while
fighting off a pack of ninjas.

12:43.754 --> 12:48.527
You know this sounds so bad,
Hollywood just might buy it.

12:48.593 --> 12:50.931
Is there a part in it for me?

12:50.997 --> 12:52.966
Yes, you get impaled
by a lightning rod

12:53.033 --> 12:55.069
in the first frame.

12:55.136 --> 12:57.773
M‐hm. It's 'cause she a sister.

12:57.840 --> 13:01.485
See, ya'll playin'
right into the formula.

13:01.551 --> 13:04.021
I knew we could do it
if we tried.

13:05.924 --> 13:07.726
(Khadijah)
'Why, you ungrateful..'

13:09.997 --> 13:11.932
[grunting]

13:17.072 --> 13:18.708
What's goin' on?

13:18.775 --> 13:22.880
Norma Rae, here, incited a riot
at flavor today.

13:22.947 --> 13:27.520
Is that so? Well, alright,
my little wildcat.

13:27.587 --> 13:29.824
I told Khadijah
if she doesn't meet our demands

13:29.890 --> 13:31.592
there'll be heck to pay.

13:31.659 --> 13:36.666
You know, uh, I like it
when you get fiesty, momma.

13:36.733 --> 13:41.305
You, uh‐You wanna go for
a little stroll or something?

13:41.372 --> 13:45.178
Hold up. Never get in the middle
of a fight between two women.

13:45.245 --> 13:47.514
Unless there's mud involved,
you know?

13:47.581 --> 13:48.816
Let me tell you somethin'.

13:48.883 --> 13:51.987
Strike or no strike,
Flavour is not shuttin' down.

13:52.054 --> 13:54.323
I'll run that magazine myself
if I have to.

13:54.390 --> 13:56.660
Yes, and don't worry Khadijah,
I'll help you.

13:56.726 --> 13:59.730
I loaned you $2,000 last time
the magazine was in trouble

13:59.798 --> 14:02.041
and I ain't seein' that
go down the toilet

14:02.108 --> 14:03.643
'cause you screwed up again.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.946
‐ My girl.
‐ Alright!

14:06.013 --> 14:06.980
‐ You know me.
‐ See?

14:07.047 --> 14:08.516
You know me.

14:08.583 --> 14:10.085
Always there
with a helping hand.

14:10.152 --> 14:14.324
Be careful. Give her a hand
and she'll take your heart!

14:14.390 --> 14:17.995
How about I snatch it
out of your chest?

14:20.165 --> 14:22.936
Alright ladies,
let's not get ugly.

14:23.002 --> 14:25.272
Oh it's much to late for that,
isn't it?

14:25.339 --> 14:27.876
‐ Oh so now you gonna try and‐‐
‐ Oh, becuase you're‐‐

14:27.943 --> 14:29.145
[arguing]

14:29.211 --> 14:31.348
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

14:31.414 --> 14:33.517
Hey!

14:33.584 --> 14:36.955
Now, I know this situation is
difficult for all of us, right?

14:39.024 --> 14:41.061
But if we just speak slowly,
and clearly..

14:41.127 --> 14:43.630
...Regine can get it all down
for our screenplay.

14:43.697 --> 14:44.632
Okay, action.

14:44.699 --> 14:47.169
[arguing]

14:47.235 --> 14:48.171
[telephone ringing]

14:50.974 --> 14:52.009
Flavour. Hold.

14:52.076 --> 14:54.179
[telephone ringing]

14:54.245 --> 14:55.380
Flavour. Hold.

14:55.447 --> 14:57.617
[telephone ringing]

14:57.684 --> 15:00.020
Flavour. Hold.

15:00.087 --> 15:02.831
This is easy.

15:02.897 --> 15:04.466
Max, did you proofread
those articles?

15:04.533 --> 15:05.735
No. I was too busy

15:05.801 --> 15:07.437
doing this riveting
hip‐hop crossword puzzle.

15:10.641 --> 15:13.979
So, guess you're ready
to get back to work. huh?

15:14.046 --> 15:17.517
We're here to negotiate on
behalf of the rest of the staff.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.620
I guess you've learned
that it's pretty difficult

15:19.687 --> 15:20.721
running Flavor without us.

15:20.788 --> 15:21.823
We're doin' fine.

15:21.890 --> 15:24.460
Oh yeah? What's with all
the calls on hold?

15:24.526 --> 15:28.298
I keep them there till
they forget what they want.

15:28.365 --> 15:30.735
Okay, she's good on the phones.

15:30.802 --> 15:36.142
Nonetheless, here's our list
of needs for your consideration.

15:36.209 --> 15:38.980
Okay, I'll get the copier fixed,
buy some pens

15:39.046 --> 15:41.049
and get a whole box
of staple removers.

15:41.116 --> 15:42.050
And that's it.

15:42.117 --> 15:44.053
What about the health plan?
The raises?

15:44.120 --> 15:46.824
My yearly Junka' to Jamaica?

15:46.891 --> 15:49.127
Enough. We're goin' to every
news stand in Brooklyn

15:49.194 --> 15:50.662
tellin' people
not to buy Flavor.

15:50.729 --> 15:52.098
‐ Come on.
‐ You wouldn't.

15:52.164 --> 15:53.533
Yes I would.

15:53.600 --> 15:57.005
Synclaire, I'm tellin' you,
I'm gonna..

15:57.071 --> 15:59.308
...I'm gonna call your mother.

16:01.684 --> 16:03.554
Bobby‐Bo,
she's playin' tough.

16:03.620 --> 16:06.057
Khadijah,
these people work hard for you.

16:06.123 --> 16:07.392
Nobody asked you.

16:07.459 --> 16:09.695
And you're way outta
your league, you wannabe writer.

16:09.762 --> 16:10.897
My column was good.

16:10.964 --> 16:13.700
‐ Hey, I call 'em as I see 'em.
‐ You need glasses.

16:13.767 --> 16:15.536
I think you need
"Hooked on Phonics".

16:15.603 --> 16:16.738
Phonics?

16:16.805 --> 16:20.577
Excuse me.
Khadijah, phone for you.

16:20.643 --> 16:22.212
It's your mother.

16:22.279 --> 16:24.548
Yeah right. Sons of..

16:24.615 --> 16:26.251
Hello?

16:26.318 --> 16:28.621
Hi, ma‐Hi, mommy.

16:28.688 --> 16:29.689
Well, she started it.

16:29.755 --> 16:31.692
‐ No I didn't, Rita!
‐ She did so!

16:31.758 --> 16:33.227
'She's always
doin' stuff like this'

16:33.294 --> 16:34.629
She's not bein' fair.

16:34.696 --> 16:36.164
No, I'm not gonna say sorry..

16:36.231 --> 16:37.400
Gets me sick.

16:40.704 --> 16:43.208
Ha ha ha ha! Woo!

16:43.274 --> 16:45.076
This screenplay turned out
really great!

16:45.143 --> 16:47.580
Yeah, no doubt.
This is a million dollar movie.

16:47.647 --> 16:50.818
Yeah. Too bad it's not yours.

16:50.884 --> 16:55.190
Yeah, that Marvin at the video
store really knows how to write.

16:55.257 --> 16:56.559
Who are we kidding, Kyle?

16:56.626 --> 16:59.663
Our script's not good enough
for an infomercial.

16:59.730 --> 17:03.842
Regina the problem is, you
havn't heard out words, right?

17:03.909 --> 17:06.479
So let's read a scene
from the screenplay out loud

17:06.546 --> 17:08.348
And you hear how good it is.

17:08.415 --> 17:09.684
Alright?
Regina, you play Regina.

17:09.750 --> 17:11.352
I'll play Lyle, of course.

17:11.419 --> 17:14.423
And Overton, you play
Professor Earnest Wakefield

17:14.490 --> 17:16.459
the mad scientist.

17:16.526 --> 17:19.497
So I'm insane?

17:19.563 --> 17:21.300
No, just angry.

17:23.234 --> 17:24.404
Action.

17:24.470 --> 17:25.806
"Professor Wakefield.

17:25.872 --> 17:28.876
"Do you seriously expect me
to give you the micro‐film?

17:28.943 --> 17:31.447
"That's not what
a martial artist secret agent

17:31.514 --> 17:34.451
who is about to get married
would do. Is it?"

17:37.221 --> 17:39.190
"Shut up."

17:41.260 --> 17:44.064
"Professor, I'm a multi‐lingual
stockbroker secret agent.

17:44.131 --> 17:48.202
You expect me to let you speak
to my bride to be that way?"

17:48.269 --> 17:50.405
"Don't make me madder."

17:52.843 --> 17:55.647
"Professor Wakefield,
we've climed 700 feet

17:55.713 --> 17:58.551
"up the face of Mount Rushmore
to your secret hideout.

17:58.617 --> 18:00.960
We want the device
and we want it now."

18:01.027 --> 18:02.629
"Grr."

18:05.400 --> 18:07.903
"Regina, the poison darts you've
hidden in your wedding gown.

18:07.969 --> 18:10.407
Throw them. Now!"

18:12.910 --> 18:15.279
"Commandoes. Get them!"

18:17.516 --> 18:18.484
That's it. I'm done.

18:18.551 --> 18:19.886
Uh, well..

18:19.953 --> 18:24.292
Oh, now now, Regina. This could
be a proper little film.

18:24.359 --> 18:27.202
Maybe not domestically,
but internationally.

18:27.269 --> 18:29.572
Let's just send it
to the Republic of Togo.

18:29.638 --> 18:32.776
I'm sure they'll line up outside
the movie hut for this one

18:32.842 --> 18:34.945
[indistinct yelling]

18:35.012 --> 18:36.848
Regine, Regine, listen.

18:36.915 --> 18:39.418
You aren't going to take
the opinion of a man

18:39.485 --> 18:41.989
who's favourite movie
is "The Little Elf That Could".

18:42.055 --> 18:45.660
Hey, don't make me madder.

18:45.727 --> 18:46.661
[indistinct yelling]

18:48.764 --> 18:51.902
I still can't believe
she called my mother!

18:51.968 --> 18:53.337
Alright Khadijah,
alright, listen.

18:53.404 --> 18:56.341
It's almost midnight, and I've
got a plan for compromise.

18:56.408 --> 18:57.743
No. I'm not hearin' it.

18:57.810 --> 19:00.113
And I'm not givin' in
to that renegade Rasta.

19:00.180 --> 19:03.624
And I have cut Synclaire's
branch from the family tree.

19:03.691 --> 19:05.995
Alright. We don't have time
for your little pow‐wow.

19:06.062 --> 19:07.530
Are you gonna meet our demands

19:07.597 --> 19:09.933
or are we gonna
shut this place down?

19:10.000 --> 19:10.934
How'd I do?

19:11.001 --> 19:13.405
‐ Pretty good.
‐ Good good.

19:13.472 --> 19:17.577
Look. I'm here to negotiate
in good faith.

19:17.643 --> 19:18.612
Right Max?

19:18.679 --> 19:19.646
Yeah, sure.

19:19.713 --> 19:23.251
I am a fair
and reasonable woman.

19:23.318 --> 19:25.254
‐ Right Max?
‐ Whatever.

19:27.524 --> 19:31.296
But financially, I just
can't meet your salary demands.

19:31.362 --> 19:32.664
Right Max?

19:32.731 --> 19:36.669
Khadijah, may I scream at you
for a moment? Come here.

19:36.736 --> 19:38.071
I looked at your books.

19:38.138 --> 19:40.642
If you move your discretionary
fund over to your payroll

19:40.709 --> 19:42.945
you can give your staff
a two‐and‐a‐half percent raise

19:43.012 --> 19:46.016
But that's my cushion. What if I
get in financial trouble again?

19:46.082 --> 19:50.155
That would be a hint that
you don't know what you're doin'

19:50.222 --> 19:52.725
Khadijah, you're worried that
Flavour might go under one day.

19:52.791 --> 19:55.295
I'm talkin' about it going
out of business right now.

19:55.362 --> 19:56.731
Can you dig me?

19:58.767 --> 20:00.742
Yeah, I guess.

20:01.778 --> 20:03.580
Alight, lookie here.

20:03.646 --> 20:07.018
Khadijah's offering you
a two‐and‐a‐half percent raise.

20:07.085 --> 20:08.420
Take it or leave it.

20:08.487 --> 20:11.156
‐ Sounds good to me.
‐ The demand is five percent.

20:12.392 --> 20:14.962
If we fire our Music Editor

20:15.029 --> 20:16.964
we can give you all
five percent.

20:21.304 --> 20:24.842
Two‐and‐a‐half percent.
Not a penny less.

20:24.909 --> 20:27.846
And a tropical aquarium
with a castle.

20:27.913 --> 20:31.151
A goldfish in a baggie.

20:31.218 --> 20:33.754
Deal.

20:33.821 --> 20:37.259
Well, now that we're back
on the payroll.

20:37.326 --> 20:39.529
I saved those receipts
from dinner

20:39.595 --> 20:43.400
and this is what you owe me.

20:43.468 --> 20:46.405
Wait. Bobby Billionaire
is cheaper than Khadijah.

20:50.811 --> 20:53.314
Sorry I had to go against you
like that Khadijah.

20:53.381 --> 20:56.719
But, I had to stand up for
myself. I learned that from you.

20:56.786 --> 20:58.188
Please don't hate me.

20:58.255 --> 21:00.864
You're my cousin.
I could never hate you.

21:00.931 --> 21:02.233
Unless you woulda' held out

21:02.300 --> 21:05.505
and then I woulda' had to
kick your ass out the house.

21:08.442 --> 21:10.712
That's beautiful.

21:10.778 --> 21:13.015
Except for
the kickin' my ass part.

21:14.883 --> 21:17.053
Well, it's all behind us now.

21:17.121 --> 21:19.590
Yeah. A‐Almost.

21:19.657 --> 21:24.125
Um, the day we walked out,
a few bills came in way past due

21:24.192 --> 21:27.125
and since I wasn't working,
I didn't pay them.

21:29.358 --> 21:31.292
[theme music]

21:34.058 --> 21:36.025
(Khadijah)
'This is really cool of you,
