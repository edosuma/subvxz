08:32.162 --> 08:33.760
- All the pieces are still here.
- Yup.

08:33.785 --> 08:36.253
- Oh, nice.
- All right. Boom!

08:36.278 --> 08:37.844
There it is right here.

08:37.946 --> 08:40.347
I've seen this one other
time at, like, a show.

08:40.448 --> 08:42.948
Hardly ever does anyone
still have the Styrofoam.

08:43.051 --> 08:45.051
Yeah, that's a big deal, that the trash

08:45.153 --> 08:46.619
that was inside the
actual trash compactor...

08:46.722 --> 08:48.088
- Yeah.
- Was just foam.

08:48.190 --> 08:49.222
I didn't realize that,
so then, how much...

08:49.324 --> 08:50.857
- Yeah.
- Of this foam trash

08:50.959 --> 08:52.459
got sucked up by vacuum cleaners

08:52.561 --> 08:54.194
- across America in the '70s?
- [laughter]

08:54.296 --> 08:56.129
Probably all of it except for this bag.

08:56.231 --> 08:57.697
[laughter]

08:58.299 --> 08:59.930
- Recognize him?
- Oh, yeah.

08:59.955 --> 09:01.339
That would be a sewer monster, right?

09:01.534 --> 09:03.767
Yeah, anyone who didn't have this toy

09:03.792 --> 09:05.592
wouldn't even know what
the monster looked like.

09:05.617 --> 09:06.950
So it was never seen on screen?

09:06.975 --> 09:08.028
Well just this... Just
this part was, remember?

09:08.053 --> 09:09.519
Just... just the head, right?

09:09.544 --> 09:10.710
Remember, he stuck his head
out, and it turned around?

09:10.735 --> 09:13.059
- Yeah, that I remember but...
- But this, like, if you were to go

09:13.084 --> 09:14.316
- underneath the sewage...
- That's what...

09:14.341 --> 09:15.941
That's what you'd be looking at.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.290
This is something that I
really wanted, but I never had.

09:18.392 --> 09:21.754
Like, I used to go to my
friend's house and play this.

09:21.779 --> 09:23.211
Is that how you picked friends, like...

09:23.314 --> 09:24.680
Oh, yeah, yeah.

09:24.782 --> 09:26.348
[laughter]

09:26.450 --> 09:28.684
For Jay, "Star Wars," in youth,

09:28.786 --> 09:31.520
was a currency that he couldn't afford.

09:31.622 --> 09:34.690
So if you had the Death
Star, you were hoity-toity?

09:34.792 --> 09:38.791
That was only reserved
for very wealthy kids.

09:38.816 --> 09:40.896
- Somebody had it.
- Yeah, some people had it.

09:40.998 --> 09:43.598
- [laughs]
- You had a Death Star?

09:43.623 --> 09:45.322
He could act out the
movie and have a score

09:45.347 --> 09:46.622
because he had a piano
in the living room.

09:46.647 --> 09:47.880
[laughs]

09:47.905 --> 09:51.440
- Oh, my God!
- You filthy rich SOB.

09:51.542 --> 09:52.908
I gave my butler the sheet music.

09:53.010 --> 09:56.610
- I was like, "Play this."
- [laughter]

09:56.635 --> 09:58.469
Do you have a favorite "Star Wars" toy?

09:58.571 --> 10:01.672
I really dig all the toys.
They're all my favorite. Sorry.

10:01.774 --> 10:03.407
They really were, they
were all my favorite,

10:03.509 --> 10:06.071
but if I had to pick only one,

10:06.096 --> 10:08.556
I'm gonna say this one.

10:08.581 --> 10:10.080
- This one?
- No. No.

10:10.182 --> 10:11.315
- Go back.
- [laughter]

10:11.417 --> 10:15.052
I would say the Ewok play set.

10:15.154 --> 10:17.240
- That sucked.
- That was amazing!

10:17.265 --> 10:18.522
[laughter]

10:18.624 --> 10:21.024
Getting back to this,
though, I used to love...

10:21.127 --> 10:22.860
You would take the little Luke figure,

10:22.962 --> 10:25.229
and you pulled him across
swinging, because you're like,

10:25.331 --> 10:27.164
"Oh, no, the bridge left."

10:27.266 --> 10:30.267
This bridge, I will reenact forever.

10:30.369 --> 10:32.503
Oh, I'm gonna hold you,
we're gonna get a rope here,

10:32.605 --> 10:35.372
and we're gonna demonstrate
how Luke swings across

10:35.474 --> 10:37.174
with Leia, right?

10:37.276 --> 10:38.775
Well, first you got to give
him a kiss on the cheek, right?

10:38.878 --> 10:40.677
Which one of you guys is
Luke and which one's Leia?

10:40.779 --> 10:42.079
We're gonna switch off and on and stuff.

10:42.104 --> 10:43.424
So he can kiss me, I can kiss him.

10:43.449 --> 10:44.692
You don't got to worry about it.

10:44.717 --> 10:46.216
- You guys are brother and sister.
- Yeah.

10:46.318 --> 10:47.885
One of the best subplots
ever in movie history.

10:47.987 --> 10:49.052
[laughing]

10:49.155 --> 10:50.888
The weird incestuous love affair.

10:50.990 --> 10:52.456
Yeah, when they made out, and later on,

10:52.558 --> 10:54.758
you find out, I was just like, "Oh."

10:54.860 --> 10:56.093
[laughter]

10:56.195 --> 10:58.095
That was awesome.

10:58.570 --> 11:00.136
So, why you selling it?

11:00.238 --> 11:02.338
Well, I'm looking to
open up my on shop soon...

11:02.439 --> 11:04.106
- Okay.
- And, uh, I wouldn't mind

11:04.208 --> 11:05.774
having some extra spending cash.

11:05.876 --> 11:07.476
All right, so what are you
looking to get for it today?

11:07.578 --> 11:09.845
Um, looking $150.

11:09.947 --> 11:12.748
- $150, huh?
- Is everything included?

11:12.850 --> 11:14.149
They had to include a rope, right?

11:14.251 --> 11:15.918
Probably a little rope
for them to swing on?

11:16.020 --> 11:17.753
- Oh, there was!
- There was.

11:17.855 --> 11:19.855
- Look.
- Used to be a rope, yeah.

11:19.957 --> 11:22.658
- Could you do $75?
- Mm...

11:22.760 --> 11:25.861
- $125?
- [whistles]

11:25.963 --> 11:27.796
How about $80?

11:27.898 --> 11:31.300
- $90.
- Just... just that extra 10 bucks.

11:31.402 --> 11:33.201
- All right, you got it man.
- Yeah? All right. Cool.

11:33.304 --> 11:35.154
- 90 bucks.
- All right. Nice.

11:36.440 --> 11:37.372
- Can I buy it from you Walt for $100?

11:37.474 --> 11:38.373
- $90.
- Thanks, guys.

11:38.475 --> 11:39.474
Thanks, bro.

11:39.577 --> 11:40.589
- Take care.
- All right.

11:40.637 --> 11:42.904
This is one of the few
things, pop culture-wise,

11:43.007 --> 11:46.209
that I could point at and
say, like, "I love this."

11:46.311 --> 11:48.578
Gentlemen, got a little
something for you guys here.

11:48.680 --> 11:51.347
Little something Italian. Fragile.

11:54.254 --> 11:56.889
You know how the, uh,
Suicide Squad's always being

11:56.991 --> 11:59.078
sent on these no-win suicide missions?

11:59.443 --> 12:00.976
What would be your suicide mission?

12:01.078 --> 12:03.311
Oh, my suicide mission, um,

12:03.415 --> 12:06.149
you have to break in
to the Secret Stash,

12:06.251 --> 12:09.858
and you have to steal
Bry Johnson's underpants.

12:09.883 --> 12:11.187
Wow, they've really run out of missions.

12:11.289 --> 12:13.022
[laughter]

12:13.124 --> 12:15.324
I'll just commit suicide
if that's my mission.

12:15.349 --> 12:16.538
- Yeah.
- That's your...

12:16.563 --> 12:18.212
You wouldn't do it,
that's what I'm saying.

12:18.237 --> 12:19.803
That's the tough mission...
it isn't threatening the Earth,

12:19.828 --> 12:22.331
- but who wants to do that?
- I mean, like, at night,

12:22.400 --> 12:23.733
I don't even want to
take my own underwear off.

12:23.835 --> 12:26.069
- It's so gross.
- [laughter]

12:26.171 --> 12:27.703
You wear tighty whities, right?

12:27.806 --> 12:29.806
Yeah, "Tighty" is the
operative word, so it's like,

12:29.908 --> 12:31.707
a good 15, 20 minutes to get 'em off.

12:31.810 --> 12:33.009
[laughter]

12:33.111 --> 12:35.545
But every Suicide Squad mission,

12:35.647 --> 12:37.246
there's always somebody
that's gonna die.

12:37.348 --> 12:39.548
Who's not gonna make it out alive?

12:40.200 --> 12:41.132
Me. Me. Me. I swear. Please. Oh.

12:41.234 --> 12:43.167
[laughter]

12:43.269 --> 12:44.602
Why, you want to be known for dying

12:44.704 --> 12:46.337
while removing some dude's underwear?

12:46.439 --> 12:47.853
[laughter]

12:47.878 --> 12:49.840
It's all right, what... we'll
put a plaque here in the store

12:49.865 --> 12:51.219
- in your honor.
- "He died how he lived:

12:51.244 --> 12:52.643
taking off dudes' underwear."

12:52.745 --> 12:55.746
[laughter]

12:59.618 --> 13:02.453
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

13:02.557 --> 13:05.624
<i>♪ ♪</i>

13:06.630 --> 13:08.630
- Hi, how you doing?
- I'm good. How are you?

13:08.733 --> 13:10.132
- Excellent.
- I was wondering...

13:10.234 --> 13:11.400
if I could see the
"Rick and Morty" number 1

13:11.502 --> 13:12.868
- comic on the wall?
- I'll get that.

13:12.970 --> 13:13.869
You're a "Rick and Morty" fan, huh?

13:13.971 --> 13:15.304
- Yeah.
- Excellent.

13:15.406 --> 13:17.005
- Really big one.
- We got another huge

13:17.108 --> 13:18.841
"Rick and Morty" fan right here.

13:18.943 --> 13:20.809
I don't think anyone's
ever come up to the counter

13:20.911 --> 13:23.712
and said three words
that matter as much.

13:23.814 --> 13:25.414
- [laughs]
- Or at all, really.

13:25.516 --> 13:27.416
- Any words that matter to you.
- Yeah.

13:27.518 --> 13:29.518
- Here she is.
- Oh, yay.

13:29.620 --> 13:31.253
Wubalubadubdub.

13:39.365 --> 13:41.265
- Can I take it out?
- Absolutely.

13:41.367 --> 13:44.068
This is one of the few
things, pop culture-wise,

13:44.169 --> 13:46.269
that I could point at and
say, like, "I love this."

13:46.371 --> 13:47.470
Yeah.

13:47.572 --> 13:48.705
Like, more than "The Simpsons."

13:48.807 --> 13:49.973
More than "South Park."

13:50.075 --> 13:51.541
And you were a "Simpsons" junkie.

13:51.643 --> 13:55.245
- And a regular junkie.
- [laughter]

13:55.347 --> 13:56.980
I got to admit: I've never seen it.

13:57.082 --> 13:58.948
You would love it, actually.
It is kind of, like,

13:59.050 --> 14:01.551
the bizarro version of
Doc Brown and Marty McFly.

14:01.653 --> 14:03.119
- Rick is Morty's grandfather.
- Yeah.

14:03.221 --> 14:04.988
- Okay?
- He pulls him out of school,

14:05.090 --> 14:06.756
takes him on all sorts of adventures

14:06.858 --> 14:08.625
in this, uh, flying saucer.

14:08.727 --> 14:11.628
The entire series is just
dark joke after dark joke

14:11.730 --> 14:14.063
after, like, weird sci-fi adventure.

14:14.166 --> 14:16.900
I just love how Rick creates
all these different gadgets

14:17.002 --> 14:19.102
to get out of trouble that
he's gotten himself into

14:19.204 --> 14:20.570
- in other dimensions.
- Yes.

14:20.672 --> 14:22.672
They destroyed the
Earth with a... a plague,

14:22.774 --> 14:25.175
and then they went to
another dimension where

14:25.277 --> 14:27.443
Rick and Morty actually kill themselves.

14:27.546 --> 14:30.313
They bury their doppelgangers
out in the backyard,

14:30.415 --> 14:32.348
- and take their place.
- You're right.

14:32.450 --> 14:35.151
- It's, uh, it's very dark.
- Yeah.

14:35.253 --> 14:37.787
How great would that be?
Any time you mess up at home,

14:37.889 --> 14:39.643
- boom, alternate universe.
- I don't.

14:39.668 --> 14:41.935
Just shoot the portal
gun, and you're gone.

14:41.960 --> 14:43.526
I very rarely mess up at home, though.

14:43.628 --> 14:45.962
I wouldn't need to, uh,
have an alternate universe.

14:46.064 --> 14:48.331
I'd be, like, on six
alternate universes per hour.

14:48.433 --> 14:49.933
[laughter]

14:50.035 --> 14:51.749
It's so awesome.

14:51.774 --> 14:53.673
I got to admit: it's odd seeing him

14:53.698 --> 14:55.438
- excited about something.
- Yeah.

14:55.463 --> 14:57.296
- It's very unnatural.
- Usually the things

14:57.475 --> 14:58.942
Bryan fans out about is like,

14:59.044 --> 15:00.710
"Did you hear about the
Burger Chef murders?"

15:00.812 --> 15:02.879
[laughter]

15:02.904 --> 15:05.371
Or stuff about serial killers,
so it's nice to see him

15:05.396 --> 15:08.531
kind of get happy about a
cartoon, even if the cartoon

15:08.556 --> 15:10.486
is one of the darkest
cartoons ever made.

15:10.589 --> 15:13.056
- Yeah.
- [laughter]

15:13.158 --> 15:15.892
I've heard nothing but
accolades about this series,

15:15.994 --> 15:18.361
but does the comic capture
the television show?

15:18.463 --> 15:20.530
The comic is a little more intense.

15:20.632 --> 15:22.465
- Comic is more intense?
- Yeah.

15:22.567 --> 15:25.735
There's a lot more talk about
Rick kind of selling Morty out

15:25.837 --> 15:29.205
for sex to try to get out
of trouble for himself.

15:29.307 --> 15:32.375
This sounds like some
sort of, like, lunatic.

15:32.477 --> 15:34.254
- He is.
- Who can't relate to that

15:34.279 --> 15:35.344
- growing up?
- Yeah.

15:35.369 --> 15:37.090
[laughter]

15:37.115 --> 15:40.149
Are either of you terrified
that it'll become too big,

15:40.252 --> 15:42.552
too mainstream, and
then, everywhere you look,

15:42.654 --> 15:45.021
there's "Rick and Morty"
merch, and, like, five-year-old

15:45.123 --> 15:46.923
kids are pretending
they're Rick and Morty.

15:47.025 --> 15:49.192
- Is that a bad thing?
- No, it's a horrible thing.

15:49.217 --> 15:51.094
I like liking little cult things

15:51.196 --> 15:52.662
that no one else really knows about it,

15:52.687 --> 15:53.974
but when it spreads, you're like,

15:53.999 --> 15:55.265
"You know what, get
this out of my face."

15:55.367 --> 15:57.400
No, no, no, no.

15:57.502 --> 15:59.769
All right, so how much are
you guys selling this for?

15:59.871 --> 16:02.053
We're looking for $45 for this.

16:02.874 --> 16:05.275
Can you guys do $30?

16:05.377 --> 16:07.377
No, we can't do $30.

16:07.479 --> 16:09.279
Um, what do you think?

16:09.381 --> 16:11.080
I mean, this is a first printing.

16:11.182 --> 16:14.017
Four sharp corners, super glossy still.

16:14.042 --> 16:16.096
If this was to be graded,
it would definitely

16:16.121 --> 16:17.687
be in the 9 category.

16:17.789 --> 16:19.522
And we know this book is going to just

16:19.624 --> 16:20.890
continue to rise in price

16:20.992 --> 16:22.625
'cause of the popularity of the show.

16:22.727 --> 16:25.428
I mean, this is just getting
hotter and hotter every day.

16:25.530 --> 16:26.973
Alright, you don't got to rub it in.

16:26.998 --> 16:28.865
[laughter]

16:28.967 --> 16:30.566
How about $35?

16:30.669 --> 16:32.068
What do you think, Walt? $35?

16:32.170 --> 16:33.488
For the super fan?

16:33.972 --> 16:35.605
After... after this way,
everybody's gonna know

16:35.707 --> 16:37.206
if they just say they're super fans,

16:37.309 --> 16:38.775
then we fold like a tent.

16:38.877 --> 16:41.044
- They'll do it.
- [laughter]

16:41.146 --> 16:43.379
- As he said, $35.
- Okay.

16:43.481 --> 16:45.948
- Here you go.
- Bag it up for you.

16:46.058 --> 16:47.953
Exact change. Perfect.

16:48.920 --> 16:51.512
- All right, thanks, guys. Bye.
- Take care.

16:52.524 --> 16:53.956
Any of you gentlemen know what this is?

16:54.059 --> 16:55.992
This is a piece of
Americana. You've seen it.

16:56.094 --> 16:57.451
- Damn.
- You know it.

16:58.063 --> 17:00.229
It is the leg lamp from
"A Christmas Story."

17:18.675 --> 17:19.907
Doing good, how 'bout yourselves?

17:20.010 --> 17:21.276
Got a little something.

17:21.378 --> 17:22.744
Got a little something
for you guys here.

17:22.847 --> 17:24.445
I'm not sure if you
guys are in the market.

17:24.548 --> 17:26.615
Little something Italian. Fragile.

17:26.717 --> 17:28.150
Any of you gentlemen know what this is?

17:28.252 --> 17:30.252
- It's a crate.
- Well, it is a crate.

17:30.354 --> 17:31.620
It is. It's very large crate.

17:31.722 --> 17:32.921
God. Just start setting this up.

17:32.946 --> 17:34.022
- All right.
- No ideas, gentlemen?

17:34.125 --> 17:35.591
This is a piece of Americana.

17:35.693 --> 17:36.992
- Ah.
- It's a... it's not really...

17:37.094 --> 17:38.761
I know what that is.

17:38.863 --> 17:40.362
- Got a little peek?
- [laughter]

17:40.464 --> 17:42.131
It is, in fact...

17:42.233 --> 17:43.365

- Damn.

17:43.467 --> 17:44.800
You know it.

17:44.902 --> 17:47.202
It is the leg lamp. From?

17:47.304 --> 17:50.172
- From "A Christmas Story."
- Oh, my God. It's beautiful.

17:57.948 --> 18:00.149
- So where'd you guys get it?
- We've actually bought this

18:00.251 --> 18:02.017
at the "Christmas Story" museum in Ohio,

18:02.119 --> 18:03.673
where the outside exterior
shots were taken...

18:03.698 --> 18:04.820
Right from it.

18:04.922 --> 18:06.321
So it's actually come from the house.

18:06.390 --> 18:08.690
Didn't some guy buy
the house, restore it

18:08.793 --> 18:10.459
- to its original state?
- Yes. Yes.

18:10.561 --> 18:11.994
We walked in, we bought
it, it was one of the first

18:12.096 --> 18:14.463
off the line, i.e. him
building them himself.

18:14.565 --> 18:16.165
We know this is where it needs to be.

18:16.267 --> 18:18.934
It is beautiful. It is gorgeous.

18:19.036 --> 18:20.436
This is our Christmas, man.

18:20.538 --> 18:22.137
Every Christmas, they
play this thing on TV.

18:22.239 --> 18:23.305
- Every... it's... yeah.
- 24/7.

18:23.407 --> 18:24.773
It's on a continuous loop.

18:24.875 --> 18:26.842
I would argue that it's not only

18:26.944 --> 18:28.377
one of the greatest Christmas movies,

18:28.479 --> 18:30.612
but maybe one of the
greatest all-time movies.

18:30.714 --> 18:33.215
- Agreed.
- We used this on tour.

18:33.317 --> 18:35.217
It went on tour with us for
about a year, year and a half.

18:35.319 --> 18:37.119
- You guys...
- We're a band. We tour.

18:37.221 --> 18:39.354
- You guys are a band. Okay.
- Yeah. Couldn't tell, right?

18:39.457 --> 18:41.323
- What kind of music?
- Uh, bad.

18:41.425 --> 18:43.192
[laughter]

18:43.294 --> 18:44.460
You ever heard of, uh,
the Bloodhound Gang?

18:44.562 --> 18:45.828
- Or Insane Clown Posse?
- Yes.

18:45.930 --> 18:46.862
I used to be in the Bloodhound Gang.

18:46.964 --> 18:48.330
- Okay.
- So the new band

18:48.432 --> 18:49.798
is called Wolfpac, we used this on tour.

18:49.900 --> 18:50.866
It went on tour with us for about

18:50.968 --> 18:52.167
a year, year and a half.

18:52.269 --> 18:54.870
On stage, on the DJ rig. Right there.

18:54.972 --> 18:56.472
We have things like disembodied parts.

18:56.574 --> 18:58.474
We have, uh, dead girls dancing,

18:58.576 --> 19:00.375
so the leg lamp fits the whole motif.

19:00.478 --> 19:01.910
If you really want to go for the theme,

19:02.012 --> 19:03.245
you should wear a pink bunny suit

19:03.347 --> 19:04.646
- and play guitar on stage.
- [laughs]

19:04.748 --> 19:06.482
I'd so be down for the bunny suit, man.

19:06.584 --> 19:07.917
[laughter]

19:07.934 --> 19:09.992
They didn't bring the leg lamp
out when they were performing

19:10.017 --> 19:12.051
to, like, do an homage
to "Christmas Story."

19:12.076 --> 19:13.782
They just did it
because it was appendage.

19:13.807 --> 19:16.240
Like, they had a whole bunch
of other body parts come out...

19:16.343 --> 19:18.409
Oh, so like, "This is
metal, it's a cut off leg."

19:18.511 --> 19:19.911
And you're like, "No,
it's a Christmas classic."

19:20.013 --> 19:21.749
They're like, "It's a cut off leg."

19:21.774 --> 19:23.047
[laughter]

19:23.149 --> 19:26.017
- But oh, God, I love that movie.
- Did you see it orig...

19:26.119 --> 19:28.486
- In its original theatrical run?
- Yeah, I was a huge...

19:28.588 --> 19:30.555
- You did?
- Yeah, I was a massive fan

19:30.657 --> 19:32.423
of Jean Shepherd, the author of

19:32.525 --> 19:34.759
"In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash."

19:34.861 --> 19:37.362
That's the book that they
pulled "Christmas Story" from.

19:37.464 --> 19:39.764
Plus, it was made by the
guy that made "Porky's."

19:39.866 --> 19:41.766
So I was in the bag for this flick.

19:41.868 --> 19:44.235
[laughter]

19:44.908 --> 19:46.037
Why you guys looking to sell it today?

19:46.139 --> 19:47.739
- It's one of our props.
- We've got to get rid of it.

19:47.841 --> 19:49.774
We've got to get some
money up for the next tour.

19:49.876 --> 19:51.175
- Can I plug it in?
- Absolutely.

19:51.277 --> 19:53.106
- Absolutely.
- Should be good.

19:54.284 --> 19:56.748
It does give off a glow
that makes you feel...

19:56.850 --> 19:58.211
better.

19:59.165 --> 20:01.419
You've injected Christmas into my heart.

20:01.521 --> 20:03.121
Once it lights up,
you're just there, man.

20:03.223 --> 20:04.956
- All right, you...
- I'm in.

20:05.058 --> 20:06.958
- You're in? Okay.
- I want it. How much?

20:07.060 --> 20:09.293
We're looking at about $1,000.
That's what we'd like to do.

20:09.769 --> 20:11.502
- Grand.
- A grand.

20:11.527 --> 20:12.926
We were gonna come in at $1,2000.

20:12.951 --> 20:14.465
We knew we were gonna
get beat up at $1,200.

20:14.567 --> 20:16.768
- [laughter]
- Soon as we...

20:17.499 --> 20:19.062
What do you think?

20:20.385 --> 20:22.819
- 500 bucks.
- Ooh.

20:22.982 --> 20:25.912
We'd be taking a huge loss at $500.

20:27.228 --> 20:29.124
Could you do $800?

20:29.149 --> 20:30.915
How about $600?

20:31.017 --> 20:32.950
Can you do $650?

20:33.053 --> 20:35.486
I... I... I can't quibble on 50 bucks.

20:35.588 --> 20:37.722
- Merry Christmas.
- Done. Merry Christmas.

20:37.824 --> 20:39.457
Enjoy it.

20:39.868 --> 20:41.301
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

20:41.357 --> 20:43.076
Don't forget your, uh, your cart.

20:43.101 --> 20:44.934
- Yes.
- Thank you, guys. Enjoy.

20:44.959 --> 20:46.525
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.328
We almost got a free
hand truck out of it, man.

20:48.430 --> 20:50.130
Why'd you have to say something?

20:50.231 --> 20:51.697
It's... it's... it's beautiful.

20:51.799 --> 20:54.300
Have you ever revealed
your... Your shoe fetish?

20:54.402 --> 20:55.534
It's not a shoe fetish.

20:55.637 --> 20:56.902
I thought it was a shoe fetish.

20:57.005 --> 20:58.204
- No.
- It's totally normal, and

20:58.306 --> 20:59.538
I don't see a psychiatrist for it.

20:59.641 --> 21:03.009
- Yeah.
- [laughter]

21:03.034 --> 21:06.235
Just like Batman, this show
is gonna pull its grappling gun

21:06.260 --> 21:08.038
and disappear into the night, man.

21:08.149 --> 21:09.982
For "Comic Book Men," I'm Kevin Smith.

21:10.084 --> 21:11.484
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

21:11.586 --> 21:12.818
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

21:12.920 --> 21:15.254
Go get yourself some puddin', Mr. Jay.

21:15.279 --> 21:16.579
Good night.
