00:26.422 --> 00:28.054
No, you're fine, Koi.

00:28.056 --> 00:30.534
I'm not staying. My shift's over.

00:31.388 --> 00:32.927
Any action in the parking lots?

00:32.929 --> 00:34.595
Not since you left for dinner.

00:34.597 --> 00:36.695
Maybe it's the new cameras.

00:36.697 --> 00:38.561
Maybe it's the regular patrols we added.

00:38.563 --> 00:41.737
Or maybe I'm just incredibly persuasive.

00:42.498 --> 00:43.862
Well...

00:43.864 --> 00:45.279
Before you go.

00:47.231 --> 00:49.629
Your buddy Mack's been
playing poker and drinking

00:49.631 --> 00:50.896
for seven hours straight.

00:50.898 --> 00:53.463
He's smashed again. Getting loud.

00:53.465 --> 00:55.896
Customers are starting to complain.

00:55.898 --> 00:57.830
Wasn't sure how you
wanted me to handle it.

00:59.599 --> 01:02.397
Yes!

01:02.399 --> 01:05.872
Come on. Wow. Talk about

01:05.873 --> 01:06.906
bad sportsmanship.

01:06.908 --> 01:08.105
Just 'cause, I mean,

01:08.107 --> 01:10.139
I won $17,000

01:10.141 --> 01:12.173
that used to belong to all of you, um...

01:12.175 --> 01:15.073
Hey, Mack. I think it's time to go.

01:15.075 --> 01:19.373
Hey, everybody, hide your endorphins.

01:19.375 --> 01:21.673
The fun police are here.

01:21.675 --> 01:24.074
Looks like you've had quite a ride.

01:25.343 --> 01:29.207
How about you leave now
and go out on top?

01:30.443 --> 01:31.808
You're drunk, Mack.

01:31.810 --> 01:33.576
I need you to go.

01:34.377 --> 01:37.041
Don't do this to me, man.

01:37.043 --> 01:39.076
This is my day.

01:39.078 --> 01:40.775
This is my table!

01:40.777 --> 01:43.576
I've been waiting
seven months for this day

01:43.578 --> 01:45.430
and this table!

01:45.432 --> 01:48.043
Sorry. Time to step away.

01:53.579 --> 01:55.143
Door's that way.

01:55.145 --> 01:57.577
Can I at least cash in my chips?

01:57.579 --> 01:59.610
How about we wait until another time

01:59.612 --> 02:02.178
when you're feeling better?

02:04.779 --> 02:07.311
All right.

02:09.447 --> 02:10.645
Grab him.!

02:11.647 --> 02:12.845
Come on! Get up!

02:12.847 --> 02:15.145
You're done. You're done, Mack!

02:15.147 --> 02:16.446
You're banned!

02:16.448 --> 02:18.779
Now you're never welcome
in this casino again!

02:18.781 --> 02:20.094
And get a lawyer.

02:20.096 --> 02:21.813
I'm pressing charges.

02:21.815 --> 02:23.647
You post his picture, make
sure he doesn't get back in.

02:23.649 --> 02:24.913
Yes, sir.

03:09.586 --> 03:11.810
Be nice. Don't judge.

03:12.020 --> 03:14.188
Be nice. Don't judge.

03:14.774 --> 03:16.952
Be nice. Don't judge.

03:17.252 --> 03:19.019
Whoever he is, he's wonderful.

03:19.021 --> 03:22.753
Whoever he is, he's wonderful.

03:23.054 --> 03:25.628
Whoever he is, he's wonderful.

03:27.188 --> 03:28.553
Please, this way.

03:28.555 --> 03:31.486
When in doubt, smile.

03:31.488 --> 03:33.670
When in doubt, smile.

03:34.255 --> 03:36.420
When in doubt, smile.

03:38.389 --> 03:40.687
Bull!

03:42.546 --> 03:44.021
It's only two hours.

03:44.023 --> 03:47.021
It's only two hours.
It's only two hours.

03:47.023 --> 03:48.955
There you go. Thank you.

03:48.957 --> 03:51.155
Wonder if that's his real hair.

03:51.157 --> 03:52.855
Let me see that wedding finger.

03:52.857 --> 03:55.556
No ring.

03:55.558 --> 03:57.756
No indent of the finger flesh.

03:57.758 --> 03:59.956
Maybe he's actually single.

03:59.958 --> 04:02.056
- True story.
- No it isn't.

04:02.058 --> 04:03.457
You just cleared your throat.

04:03.459 --> 04:05.490
Pretty good indicator
that you're about to lie.

04:05.492 --> 04:08.523
When Marissa and I met and we
were comparing histories,

04:08.525 --> 04:11.657
backstories, and she told me she
worked for Homeland Security,

04:11.659 --> 04:14.591
I was convinced it
was the name of a bank.

04:14.593 --> 04:17.390
I'm sorry. I still don't believe that.

04:17.392 --> 04:19.291
Good. Neither do I.

04:19.293 --> 04:20.825
But it is a good story.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.091
It made you smile.

04:22.094 --> 04:23.559
It still makes me smile.

04:23.561 --> 04:26.325
The only reason I am here,
my dear, is to make you smile.

04:28.301 --> 04:30.759
My God. I'm gonna throw up.

04:30.761 --> 04:32.672
So how'd you two meet?

04:32.674 --> 04:34.493
The strangest thing.

04:34.495 --> 04:37.393
I was in my apartment and she
just knocked on the door.

04:37.395 --> 04:40.179
Did you know women do that?

04:40.181 --> 04:42.727
That is not what happened.
I was sitting at the bar

04:42.729 --> 04:44.728
at this place I always go to, just...

04:44.730 --> 04:47.561
to catch a bite after work,

04:47.563 --> 04:49.195
and Kyle was sitting right next to me.

04:49.197 --> 04:50.394
You did notice?

04:50.396 --> 04:51.561
Of course I noticed.

04:51.563 --> 04:53.195
This is the first time
she's admitted it.

04:53.197 --> 04:55.961
She's always maintained she
never noticed I was there.

04:55.963 --> 04:58.528
Kill me now. It's like
they're married already.

04:58.530 --> 04:59.762
Anyway,

04:59.764 --> 05:01.562
when he got up to leave, I realized that

05:01.564 --> 05:03.596
he left his wallet there on the bar,

05:03.598 --> 05:05.863
so I didn't know what to do
at first, but then the old.

05:05.865 --> 05:08.063
Homeland Security training kicked in.

05:08.065 --> 05:10.197
Looked in the wallet, realized he lived

05:10.199 --> 05:11.896
around the corner.

05:11.898 --> 05:14.430
So you knocked on his door.

05:14.432 --> 05:16.364
Don't ask how long she stayed.

05:16.366 --> 05:18.597
I hate this guy.

05:19.222 --> 05:21.331
We've done projects on every continent.

05:21.333 --> 05:23.264
I mean, the good news is, you know,

05:23.266 --> 05:25.031
every single day, people are being born,

05:25.033 --> 05:27.164
and they all need places to live.

05:27.166 --> 05:29.965
We're happy to be the ones
to build apartments for them.

05:30.432 --> 05:32.432
You selfsatisfied turd.

05:32.434 --> 05:35.065
I will be right back.

05:38.634 --> 05:41.433
God, I'm shallow.

05:41.435 --> 05:44.200
You see her? The look on her face?

05:44.202 --> 05:46.166
You ever seen her so happy?

05:46.168 --> 05:47.500
What's wrong with you, Jason?

05:47.502 --> 05:49.034
Get on board, here.

05:54.503 --> 05:55.534
It's on me.

05:55.536 --> 05:57.067
And you just cleared your throat.

05:57.069 --> 05:58.701
You don't want to pay this bill.

05:58.703 --> 06:00.501
I don't know, makes me feel funny.

06:00.503 --> 06:01.701
No, it doesn't.

06:01.703 --> 06:03.868
Well, you'll get the next one.

06:05.771 --> 06:07.035
Thanks.

06:13.971 --> 06:15.303
Hello.

06:15.305 --> 06:17.203
You have a collect
call from Makya Benally

06:17.205 --> 06:19.170
at the Nawakwa Nation
Correctional Facility

06:19.172 --> 06:20.503
in Marstick, New York.

06:20.505 --> 06:21.903
Will you accept the charges?

06:21.905 --> 06:25.104
I will, Operator, and, let
me just get somewhere private.

06:25.106 --> 06:26.571
Excuse me.

06:28.206 --> 06:29.738
Mack, is that you?

06:29.740 --> 06:32.637
Bull. Been a long time.

06:32.639 --> 06:33.971
Thanks for taking the call.

06:33.973 --> 06:36.271
Operator said you were calling
from prison.

06:36.273 --> 06:37.939
Something I should know?

06:37.941 --> 06:39.856
I need your help, bud.

06:40.755 --> 06:42.839
I got myself in a hell of a pickle.

06:42.841 --> 06:44.439
What are we talking about?

06:44.441 --> 06:46.306
We're not talking about anything.

06:46.308 --> 06:47.982
But the cops here...

06:48.475 --> 06:51.073
are talking about first degree murder.

06:52.942 --> 06:55.316
I'll be there within the hour.

07:10.610 --> 07:12.109
Taxi.

07:26.553 --> 07:27.767
Thanks for coming, man.

07:29.469 --> 07:31.757
It's okay, it's okay.

07:31.782 --> 07:33.114
Let me look at you.

07:34.816 --> 07:36.862
Same old Mack?

07:38.361 --> 07:40.848
When was the last time I saw you?

07:42.917 --> 07:45.935
Vegas. Almost, like, six years ago.

07:45.936 --> 07:47.168
Yeah.

07:47.170 --> 07:49.240
You were dealing cards at the Bellagio.

07:49.242 --> 07:51.219
Going out with that showgirl.

07:52.027 --> 07:53.636
You lived in a nice apartment.

07:54.958 --> 07:56.905
That was her apartment.

07:57.630 --> 07:59.905
So what went wrong?

07:59.907 --> 08:01.571
Turns out she was married.

08:01.573 --> 08:03.281
And she didn't tell you.

08:03.774 --> 08:05.172
She told me.

08:05.174 --> 08:07.372
I think I just didn't
assign much importance to it,

08:07.374 --> 08:10.173
until one night I woke up

08:10.175 --> 08:11.572
and the fella who was
actually paying the mortgage

08:11.574 --> 08:12.773
was standing over me

08:12.775 --> 08:15.707
with a .357.

08:15.709 --> 08:17.974
Those are the nights you wish
you were wearing pajamas.

08:20.909 --> 08:22.474
So, you done?

08:23.492 --> 08:24.775
Done what?

08:24.777 --> 08:28.141
Doing your imitation of the
dimmest guy in the room.

08:28.143 --> 08:29.608
You don't need to hustle me.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.242
You don't need to charm me.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.075
I'm already here.

08:33.784 --> 08:35.475
I'm at the table, I'm in the game,

08:35.477 --> 08:37.326
so deal me in, Mack.

08:37.844 --> 08:39.775
What happened?

08:42.044 --> 08:43.784
What'd the tribal cop say?

08:47.712 --> 08:49.510
That you were drunk.

08:49.512 --> 08:51.444
That you publicly threatened
the murder victim

08:51.446 --> 08:53.477
after you were banned from the casino,

08:53.479 --> 08:57.244
and then hours later were
standing over his dead body.

08:59.880 --> 09:01.578
It's all true.

09:02.380 --> 09:04.345
Except I didn't do it.

09:04.347 --> 09:07.412
Yeah, Pat and I got
into it at the casino.

09:07.829 --> 09:09.621
But then he threw me out.

09:10.414 --> 09:12.662
Then I went home and I cooled off.

09:13.315 --> 09:14.812
That's when he texted me.

09:15.413 --> 09:18.080
Told me to come on over
and bury the hatchet.

09:18.872 --> 09:22.447
Pardon the racially insensitive
figure of speech.

09:22.449 --> 09:26.580
What do you mean,
"come over," to his house?

09:26.582 --> 09:27.981
Yeah.

09:27.983 --> 09:30.539
I've known Pat longer
than I've known you.

09:31.216 --> 09:34.148
We both grew up here on the reservation.

09:34.150 --> 09:36.982
He liked to play the tough guy.

09:36.984 --> 09:38.682
That was his M.O.

09:40.217 --> 09:42.648
So he was dead when you got there.

09:42.650 --> 09:43.949
Yeah.

09:43.951 --> 09:46.349
Covered in blood.

09:47.418 --> 09:50.250
I was the guy who called 911.

09:52.018 --> 09:54.083
I swear I didn't do it.

09:54.085 --> 09:55.876
I don't even own a gun.

09:58.652 --> 10:00.817
Come on, college roommate.

10:01.919 --> 10:03.917
Tell me this is gonna be okay.

10:03.919 --> 10:06.284
You know me. I'm a lot of things,

10:06.286 --> 10:07.939
but I'm not a murderer.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.376
Of course, Mack.

10:09.954 --> 10:12.319
It's the middle of the night.

10:12.321 --> 10:14.652
And you know, I'm not a lawyer,

10:14.654 --> 10:16.919
and this is reservation land.

10:16.921 --> 10:20.086
You guys have your own
courts, your own rules.

10:23.288 --> 10:26.754
I'm not even sure how much
help I can actually be.

10:28.555 --> 10:30.004
Please.

10:33.338 --> 10:35.880
You're the smartest guy I ever met.

10:37.588 --> 10:39.421
Just...

10:39.838 --> 10:42.088
Just get involved.

10:43.223 --> 10:44.689
Get me through this.

10:45.881 --> 10:47.897
His name's Makya Benally.

10:47.899 --> 10:50.256
Apparently,
he was Bull's college roommate

10:50.258 --> 10:51.588
his freshman year.

10:51.590 --> 10:54.562
Born and raised on the
Nawakwa Reservation.

10:54.564 --> 10:57.623
After college, he made his way to Vegas

10:57.625 --> 11:01.324
working as a dealer and playing
cards for money after hours.

11:01.326 --> 11:03.723
Ultimately, he got
banned from every casino

11:03.725 --> 11:05.757
in the state, so when he
couldn't make a living anymore,

11:05.759 --> 11:08.757
he returned
to the reservation, and this was

11:08.759 --> 11:10.524
about two and a half years ago.

11:10.526 --> 11:12.291
His rap sheet includes convictions

11:12.293 --> 11:14.558
for drunk and disorderly conduct,

11:14.560 --> 11:16.091
assault during a bar fight,

11:16.093 --> 11:17.992
and illegal gambling,

11:17.994 --> 11:19.358
and now, of course, murder.

11:19.360 --> 11:20.792
And this is one

11:20.794 --> 11:22.292
of Bull's friends?

11:23.218 --> 11:25.626
Bull and Benny are on their way back

11:25.628 --> 11:27.359
to the reservation

11:27.361 --> 11:29.359
to see if they can
negotiate some kind of bail.

11:29.361 --> 11:31.327
Hey, Danny, in the meantime,
find out what it takes

11:31.329 --> 11:32.560
to get this case transferred

11:32.562 --> 11:33.693
to a federal court.

11:33.695 --> 11:35.393
Bull would love
to have this trial someplace

11:35.395 --> 11:36.593
where we know all the rules

11:36.595 --> 11:38.061
- and most of players.
- Will do.

11:38.063 --> 11:40.760
Cable, anything you can find out about

11:40.762 --> 11:42.627
this tribe and its court systems.

11:42.629 --> 11:44.661
How it works, prior rulings.

11:44.663 --> 11:46.227
Anything that will give us a leg up.

11:46.229 --> 11:47.428
You know, in fact,

11:47.430 --> 11:49.394
you hit the Internet,
Chunk, you hit the library.

11:49.396 --> 11:51.728
- Aye, aye, Captain.
- Done and done.

11:55.564 --> 11:57.729
This is the courthouse?

11:57.731 --> 11:59.196
And the meeting place.

11:59.198 --> 12:00.629
And the basketball court,

12:00.631 --> 12:02.430
and I think they have
school dances here, too.

12:04.071 --> 12:06.013
I'll try not to be intimidated.

12:09.032 --> 12:11.697
Wow.

12:11.699 --> 12:14.230
I see they've spared no expense here.

12:14.232 --> 12:16.431
Now, who is this guy to you again?

12:16.967 --> 12:18.931
Well, Mack was my college roommate

12:18.933 --> 12:20.431
freshman year at UConn.

12:20.433 --> 12:22.831
And you stayed in contact
since graduation?

12:22.833 --> 12:24.332
He didn't graduate.

12:24.334 --> 12:25.579
Mack got expelled.

12:25.581 --> 12:28.532
Didn't your parents
ever have that talk with you

12:28.534 --> 12:30.183
about picking your friends?

12:30.634 --> 12:33.099
He was actually a pretty fantastic guy.

12:33.642 --> 12:35.566
No, I mean it.

12:35.568 --> 12:39.167
First of all, maybe
the most fun guy in the world.

12:39.169 --> 12:40.599
Second of all, after living together

12:40.601 --> 12:42.334
for a week or two, we realized

12:42.336 --> 12:44.200
we were both pretty good
at two things...

12:44.518 --> 12:47.768
reading people and playing cards.

12:48.269 --> 12:51.701
So we put together
this underground poker game.

12:51.703 --> 12:54.535
We made a fortune.

12:54.935 --> 12:56.601
That is, until the university

12:56.603 --> 12:57.768
caught wind of it.

12:57.770 --> 12:58.868
Shut it down?

12:58.870 --> 13:00.710
Shut it down and expelled Mack.

13:02.436 --> 13:04.769
He took the fall for the whole thing.

13:05.269 --> 13:06.669
Swore up and down that

13:06.671 --> 13:08.394
I was just an innocent bystander.

13:09.353 --> 13:11.303
That's a pretty good friend.

13:11.853 --> 13:13.570
That is a pretty good friend.

13:13.572 --> 13:15.537
So what's the pitch here, Bull?

13:15.539 --> 13:17.704
How do we get your friend out on bail?

13:17.706 --> 13:19.004
Fastball down the middle.

13:19.006 --> 13:20.338
Nobody's found a murder weapon.

13:20.340 --> 13:21.704
Evidence is circumstantial.

13:21.706 --> 13:23.471
I don't think it's gonna be a problem.

13:23.473 --> 13:25.371
Don't underestimate Chief Tsosie.

13:25.373 --> 13:27.104
She can be very unpredictable.

13:28.480 --> 13:30.272
You must be Dr. Bull.

13:30.274 --> 13:32.272
I'm, Taima Wauneka,

13:32.274 --> 13:34.105
Mack's courtappointed
defense representative.

13:34.689 --> 13:36.973
I look forward to working together.

13:36.975 --> 13:38.505
I'm Benny Colรณn.

13:38.507 --> 13:41.906
I work with Dr. Bull,
and I am Mack's lawyer.

13:41.908 --> 13:44.872
Well, yes and no.

13:46.524 --> 13:48.773
And the chief you were speaking of?

13:48.775 --> 13:51.506
Chief Tsosie. She is the leader
of our tribe, and,

13:51.508 --> 13:54.974
presides over our court,
not unlike your judge.

13:56.209 --> 13:58.074
Many subtle differences.

13:58.076 --> 14:00.474
In this court, it only takes
a majority to convict,

14:00.476 --> 14:04.841
not a unanimous decision, so
that's why there are 13 jurors,

14:04.843 --> 14:07.208
and not 12,
so there's always a majority.

14:07.210 --> 14:08.339
Also,

14:08.364 --> 14:10.049
the chief picks the defense
representative,

14:10.051 --> 14:11.056
as well as the

14:11.081 --> 14:12.042
prosecution representative.

14:12.044 --> 14:14.209
- Based on...?
- Based on

14:14.211 --> 14:15.843
if she thinks you can do a good job.

14:15.845 --> 14:18.810
So there are no lawyers,
and the chief is the judge?

14:18.812 --> 14:20.210
You're catching on.

14:22.544 --> 14:25.148
So this is what it's like
in the private sector?

14:25.150 --> 14:28.011
Alice, how are you?

14:28.013 --> 14:29.377
How's life at the Bureau?

14:29.379 --> 14:30.777
Government work, government coffee.

14:30.779 --> 14:32.511
Espresso?

14:32.513 --> 14:34.244
You're cruel.

14:34.246 --> 14:36.144
Thanks for coming to me.

14:36.146 --> 14:37.845
Not a problem. I was in the area.

14:37.847 --> 14:40.112
So what do you know
about the murder case

14:40.114 --> 14:42.945
against Makya Benally
on the Nawakwa Reservation?

14:42.947 --> 14:44.979
In Marstick. I'm aware of it.

14:44.981 --> 14:46.312
Bureau's aware of it.

14:46.314 --> 14:48.046
Why do you ask?

14:48.048 --> 14:50.138
What would it take for the feds
to get jurisdiction?

14:50.140 --> 14:51.589
To try the case in federal court?

14:51.591 --> 14:53.297
It would take moving heaven and earth.

14:53.298 --> 14:54.696
Really? It's a murder case.

14:54.698 --> 14:56.730
Between two Nawakwa Nation members

14:56.732 --> 14:58.130
on their sovereign tribal land.

14:58.132 --> 14:59.730
Jurisdiction begins with them.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.163
I can't twist your arm?

15:01.165 --> 15:02.629
Not my arm you would have to twist.

15:02.631 --> 15:03.763
It's Washington's.

15:03.765 --> 15:04.963
We both know that arm doesn't move

15:04.965 --> 15:06.820
without a ton of time
and a ton of money.

15:09.799 --> 15:11.465
When do we get to sit?

15:11.907 --> 15:12.931
No one sits before the chief.

15:12.933 --> 15:14.765
It's a sign of respect.

15:15.157 --> 15:16.531
Got it.

15:16.533 --> 15:18.099
How you guys doing?

15:23.167 --> 15:25.432
Woman giving you the
evil eye... who is she?

15:25.434 --> 15:28.833
That's Wera Harjo, Pat's widow.

15:37.993 --> 15:40.334
I see we have some new faces today.

15:41.364 --> 15:42.414
Who are you?

15:42.416 --> 15:43.415
You with the glasses?

15:43.993 --> 15:45.751
- What's your name?
- Your Honor...

15:46.270 --> 15:49.267
It's Chief. Chief Tsosie.

15:50.494 --> 15:53.935
My apologies, Chief... Tsosie.

15:54.495 --> 15:56.435
My name is Dr. Jason Bull.

15:56.437 --> 15:58.402
Doctor. I assumed you were a lawyer.

15:58.404 --> 16:00.635
No.

16:00.637 --> 16:02.002
He's the lawyer.

16:02.004 --> 16:04.403
I'm what they call a trial scientist.

16:04.405 --> 16:05.803
Trial science.

16:06.318 --> 16:07.670
I think I've read about you.

16:07.672 --> 16:08.970
That's highly unlikely.

16:08.972 --> 16:10.536
No, I'm sure of it.

16:10.538 --> 16:13.471
Many years ago, I studied law in Albany.

16:13.871 --> 16:16.003
I still read many journals.

16:16.330 --> 16:18.537
Welcome to my courtroom, Dr. Bull.

16:18.914 --> 16:20.838
Please, have a seat.

16:20.840 --> 16:24.338
Today we're here to try
the case of The Tribe

16:24.340 --> 16:26.772
v. Makya Benally,

16:26.774 --> 16:28.638
who's accused of the murder

16:28.640 --> 16:31.739
of fellow tribal member Patwin Harjo.

16:31.741 --> 16:34.573
Would you please stand, Mr. Benally?

16:34.575 --> 16:36.673
How do you plead to these charges?

16:36.675 --> 16:38.840
I plead not guilty, Chief.

16:38.842 --> 16:40.307
Your plea is noted.

16:40.309 --> 16:43.373
The trial begins in two days.

16:45.333 --> 16:46.774
Two days.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.407
That's all we got to prepare?

16:48.409 --> 16:50.108
I guess we're not in Kansas anymore.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.612
When do we discuss bail?

16:52.328 --> 16:54.174
Chief, on the matter of bail?

16:54.176 --> 16:55.742
Bail?

16:55.744 --> 16:57.659
Chief, this man is accused of murder.

16:57.661 --> 16:59.308
The tribe requests
that, out of a concern

16:59.310 --> 17:02.675
for public safety,
any request for bail be denied.

17:02.677 --> 17:05.342
Chief, Makya Benally is an innocent man.

17:05.344 --> 17:07.709
Keep in mind,
no murder weapon has been found,

17:07.711 --> 17:11.429
and all evidence thus far
is circumstantial.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.509
He looks forward to participating

17:13.511 --> 17:15.076
in the preparation of his defense

17:15.078 --> 17:16.276
with his friends from Manhattan,

17:16.278 --> 17:18.487
as well as myself, but to do so,

17:18.489 --> 17:19.876
he must be able to travel.

17:20.305 --> 17:21.977
Chief, please.

17:22.337 --> 17:24.611
In this circumstance,

17:25.140 --> 17:26.212
I'll allow it.

17:27.790 --> 17:31.444
Bail is set at $100,000.

17:32.527 --> 17:33.544
Nice.

17:33.546 --> 17:35.211
Fastball down the middle.

17:35.213 --> 17:36.711
So is there a particular bail bondsman

17:36.713 --> 17:38.311
you use here on the reservation?

17:39.413 --> 17:42.797
There are no bail bondsmen
on the reservation.

17:43.589 --> 17:45.645
Then, why did we ask for bail?

17:46.047 --> 17:47.779
I don't know. Seemed like you wanted it,

17:47.781 --> 17:50.131
so I felt that I should get it for you.

17:50.581 --> 17:52.346
This mean I'm going back to jail?

17:52.348 --> 17:54.346
No, don't worry. I'll take care of it.

17:54.348 --> 17:57.148
I'll find the money... somewhere.

18:00.082 --> 18:01.380
What am I signing here?

18:01.382 --> 18:02.913
Well, we secured Mack's bail last night

18:02.915 --> 18:05.169
with money from our daytoday,

18:05.171 --> 18:08.771
so now you're moving money
over from your personal IRA

18:08.796 --> 18:10.481
to cover TAC's daytoday.

18:11.027 --> 18:13.382
You're a good friend.

18:13.384 --> 18:16.048
Correction. I'm a friend
haunted by guilt.

18:16.050 --> 18:18.782
Good friends don't pony up
this kind of money.

18:18.784 --> 18:20.716
Thank you.

18:20.718 --> 18:21.949
Whatever you say.

18:23.619 --> 18:26.016
Wow. I feel underdressed.

18:26.018 --> 18:27.683
This is all J.B.'s?

18:27.685 --> 18:29.416
You mean Dr. Bull?

18:29.418 --> 18:32.184
This and plenty more.

18:32.186 --> 18:33.750
Dr. Bull?

18:38.286 --> 18:41.551
Well, let's begin at the beginning.

18:41.553 --> 18:43.784
How do I get my hands on a jury list?

18:44.262 --> 18:46.919
There is no jury list.

18:46.921 --> 18:48.919
Um, jurors aren't randomly

18:48.921 --> 18:50.119
summoned through the mail.

18:50.121 --> 18:51.253
They volunteer.

18:51.255 --> 18:52.652
Volunteer?

18:52.654 --> 18:54.720
It's usually the same 25 or so regulars.

18:54.722 --> 18:58.020
We live in a small community...
1,400 people.

18:58.022 --> 19:01.586
You can see the same folks
on virtually every case.

19:01.588 --> 19:04.920
I do have a list of those names.

19:09.389 --> 19:11.088
Great. Cable, Chunk, split those up.

19:11.090 --> 19:12.288
Marissa,

19:12.290 --> 19:13.754
let's do this oldschool.

19:13.756 --> 19:16.255
Get a car service to take them
out to the reservation.

19:16.257 --> 19:18.288
- Be my pleasure.
- Let's get pictures of houses

19:18.290 --> 19:21.089
and cars and businesses,
see what we can surmise.

19:21.091 --> 19:22.755
And, Danny, do me a favor.

19:22.757 --> 19:24.189
Why don't you go along, too?

19:24.191 --> 19:25.623
Dig into Pat. See if he had

19:25.625 --> 19:29.056
any enemies the tribal
police may be overlooking.

19:29.058 --> 19:30.623
And you two, to the extent

19:30.625 --> 19:32.823
that you can get people
to talk to us, let's try

19:32.825 --> 19:35.657
and identify people on that list
who know and like Mack.

19:35.659 --> 19:36.991
People still love you, don't they, Mack?

19:36.993 --> 19:38.390
I'm way loved.

19:38.392 --> 19:40.423
I hope so,

19:40.425 --> 19:42.524
'cause we need all the friends
we can get on that jury.

19:42.526 --> 19:44.142
Tell 'em why, Taima.

19:44.612 --> 19:46.358
Reasonable doubt is not

19:46.360 --> 19:47.958
the standard in our tribal court.

19:47.960 --> 19:49.092
What does that mean?

19:49.094 --> 19:50.053
That means

19:50.055 --> 19:51.338
the jury only needs to believe

19:51.340 --> 19:53.958
that Mack is more likely
than not the murderer.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.559
More likely than not? Really?

19:55.561 --> 19:56.993
Really.

19:56.995 --> 19:59.359
There's a lower burden of
proof for the prosecution,

19:59.361 --> 20:02.978
which means our job is a lot harder.

20:06.729 --> 20:08.960
Okay. I felt us park.

20:08.962 --> 20:10.693
Can I take this blindfold off now?

20:10.695 --> 20:11.860
No, not yet.

20:11.862 --> 20:13.361
You feel that?

20:13.363 --> 20:14.461
That's a nice shirt.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.194
No, that's my heart pounding.

20:16.196 --> 20:18.527
Kyle, look, no, no, no.

20:18.529 --> 20:20.661
This is starting to get gooey.

20:20.663 --> 20:22.928
I'm actually not really good with gooey.

20:22.930 --> 20:26.161
I am actually really good
with going to nice restaurants,

20:26.163 --> 20:29.162
and enjoying some good wine,
and sleeping over

20:29.164 --> 20:31.229
at each other's apartment
once or twice a week.

20:31.231 --> 20:32.695
All right, stop. This isn't gooey.

20:32.697 --> 20:34.730
My heart's pounding because
I'm about to show you something

20:34.732 --> 20:36.930
that means a lot to me, and
I'm just worried that you'll...

20:36.932 --> 20:38.563
Hey, hey, hey, don't worry.

20:38.565 --> 20:40.297
Stop worrying.

20:40.299 --> 20:44.130
Okay. Take off the blindfold.

20:51.983 --> 20:54.265
Let's get out of the car.

20:59.134 --> 21:01.299
Hey.

21:02.025 --> 21:05.099
I own this entire block.

21:05.101 --> 21:07.099
Okay.

21:07.101 --> 21:10.633
Well, me and a big Chinese bank
and a bunch of investors.

21:10.635 --> 21:12.900
I'm happy for all of you.

21:12.902 --> 21:15.166
You're trying to corner
the market on urban blight?

21:16.903 --> 21:18.166
Kinda.

21:18.168 --> 21:20.867
We're building a 40story
mixeduse building right

21:20.869 --> 21:23.368
on that corner. Biggest project
in all of Queens.

21:23.370 --> 21:26.534
Beautiful. Maybe I'll show you
the model one of these days.

21:27.236 --> 21:29.835
Highend supermarket on the ground floor

21:29.837 --> 21:32.768
of a 23story building on that corner.

21:32.770 --> 21:36.369
We are gonna transform
this neighborhood.

21:37.971 --> 21:41.036
One of my favorite words,
by the way, "transform."

21:41.038 --> 21:42.370
I've never seen you like this.

21:42.372 --> 21:44.470
You're like a little kid.

21:44.472 --> 21:47.136
I spend every day thinking
of two things:

21:47.138 --> 21:49.770
You and this.

21:49.772 --> 21:52.697
I just thought it was
time you met each other.

22:02.740 --> 22:04.238
Enough of that.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.639
Let's go find a fine restaurant,
drink some good wine,

22:06.641 --> 22:08.772
and figure out whose
apartment to wake up in.

22:08.774 --> 22:11.106
In a minute.

22:13.108 --> 22:15.206
Sorry to keep you waiting.

22:15.208 --> 22:17.616
It's a big casino, and I'm one guy.

22:19.200 --> 22:21.474
An hour and 20 minutes.

22:21.476 --> 22:24.440
Makes me think you're not that
excited to be talking to me.

22:24.442 --> 22:26.941
My friend was murdered, and
you work for the man who did it,

22:26.943 --> 22:28.307
- so...
- The man I'm working for

22:28.309 --> 22:29.807
claims he didn't do it.

22:29.809 --> 22:32.108
And I have to believe
you're just as interested

22:32.110 --> 22:33.807
in making sure we find the real killer

22:33.809 --> 22:35.742
as much as anyone else here.

22:36.243 --> 22:37.675
So, tell me,

22:37.677 --> 22:39.175
who else might've done it?

22:39.177 --> 22:40.842
I don't know what you're talking about.

22:40.844 --> 22:42.708
- Everybody here loved Pat.
- Come on,

22:42.710 --> 22:44.376
you work for casino security.

22:44.378 --> 22:46.509
You say no to a lot of people.

22:46.511 --> 22:48.309
Okay. Sure.

22:48.828 --> 22:50.243
There are hookers we have to turn in,

22:50.245 --> 22:51.910
cars stolen from the parking lot.

22:51.912 --> 22:53.843
People lose their life savings
and blame us.

22:53.845 --> 22:56.278
But I don't think any
of those folks killed Pat.

22:56.280 --> 22:59.677
Okay. I'll ask.
Why are you so sure Mack did it?

22:59.679 --> 23:01.077
Because I was here.

23:01.496 --> 23:03.144
I saw how drunk he was.

23:03.634 --> 23:05.077
I saw how mad he was.

23:05.663 --> 23:07.244
Guy makes his living playing cards.

23:07.246 --> 23:08.678
Pat told him all that was over.

23:08.680 --> 23:09.811
He was banned.

23:10.247 --> 23:12.212
They won't let him play in Vegas.

23:12.214 --> 23:14.646
It's not like he can move
to another reservation.

23:15.278 --> 23:17.445
Let's not make this harder than it is.

23:17.447 --> 23:20.313
Well, I'm gonna make it a little harder.

23:20.914 --> 23:22.946
I'd love to get a copy
of every incident report

23:22.948 --> 23:26.280
involving security for,
say, the last three years.

23:26.282 --> 23:28.880
That something
you can pull together for me?

23:28.882 --> 23:32.247
The tribe told me to provide you
with whatever you need.

23:32.249 --> 23:34.014
I was told by my boss
to wait as long as it takes

23:34.016 --> 23:35.447
for those reports, so...

23:35.449 --> 23:37.981
this is all gonna work out perfectly.

23:41.250 --> 23:43.448
Bull. Bull.

23:44.125 --> 23:46.315
Sorry to startle you.

23:46.317 --> 23:48.282
We just got back from the reservation.

23:48.284 --> 23:49.815
I had a feeling you'd still be here,

23:49.817 --> 23:51.916
and I wanted to catch you
before you headed to court.

23:56.785 --> 23:58.816
Forgive my appearance.

23:59.418 --> 24:00.835
It's a...

24:01.219 --> 24:02.983
it's a real pageturner.

24:03.502 --> 24:04.684
So, what's up?

24:04.686 --> 24:07.717
Your buddy, he's not winning
any popularity contests

24:07.719 --> 24:09.160
on that reservation.

24:09.162 --> 24:10.884
What does that mean?

24:10.886 --> 24:13.084
Bull, I don't doubt that
he was a great roommate

24:13.086 --> 24:14.385
20some years ago.

24:14.387 --> 24:16.118
But, apparently, in present day,

24:16.120 --> 24:18.184
he's not a very good neighbor.

24:18.545 --> 24:21.652
He's the guy with noisy parties
in the middle of the week.

24:21.654 --> 24:24.952
HHe's the jerk who curses
at your kid at Halloween.

24:24.954 --> 24:27.085
He's the jackass at the community pool

24:27.087 --> 24:29.386
who rates everybody's wives
and girlfriends.

24:29.388 --> 24:31.953
Borrows money, doesn't pay it back.

24:31.955 --> 24:34.120
Drinks too much, drives too fast.

24:34.122 --> 24:36.654
And his music only plays on loud.

24:36.656 --> 24:38.687
Everybody hates him.

24:39.280 --> 24:42.454
Well, that doesn't make him
guilty of murder.

24:42.456 --> 24:43.754
The point is,

24:43.756 --> 24:46.187
of the 25 people on that jury list,

24:46.189 --> 24:48.088
18 people know him

24:48.090 --> 24:50.421
and 18 people hate him.

24:50.423 --> 24:54.355
And the other seven
haven't heard anything good.

24:57.962 --> 24:59.390
The jury is set.

24:59.870 --> 25:01.324
The trial will commence

25:01.349 --> 25:03.380
after a onehour lunch break.

25:06.515 --> 25:09.380
This jury wants to send me
to the firing squad.

25:09.382 --> 25:11.314
And the trial hasn't even started.

25:11.316 --> 25:13.715
I thought this jury stuff
was your specialty.

25:13.717 --> 25:15.147
Who knew?

25:15.149 --> 25:17.314
To know you is to loathe you.

25:17.316 --> 25:19.509
We're eating lunch in the car.

25:19.917 --> 25:21.427
Let's go.

25:21.429 --> 25:23.582
There were two people on that
jury who weren't on your list.

25:23.584 --> 25:24.948
- You know 'em?
- Sure.

25:24.950 --> 25:27.148
The woman is Catori Yazzie.

25:27.150 --> 25:29.716
Um, Pat's wife, Wera,
actually saved her child

25:29.718 --> 25:31.916
on the operating table
a couple years back.

25:31.918 --> 25:34.396
Wow. When it rains, it tsunamis.

25:34.398 --> 25:37.350
The other one, though, the
man, that's, Joe Chavis.

25:37.352 --> 25:40.384
He's a very prominent
businessman on the reservation.

25:40.386 --> 25:44.384
Not the kind of guy that usually
volunteers for juries, but,

25:44.386 --> 25:47.684
he owns the car wash, runs an auto shop.

25:47.686 --> 25:50.218
Um, he's actually talking
about maybe even opening up

25:50.220 --> 25:51.951
- a dealership.
- His house,

25:51.953 --> 25:54.418
his business... any of those
close enough to visit?

25:54.420 --> 25:56.919
Well, the auto shop
is a couple minutes away.

25:56.921 --> 25:58.719
I'm not sure what you'll learn,

25:58.721 --> 25:59.919
- but...
- Driver,

25:59.921 --> 26:01.752
- this man will direct you.
- Yes, sir.

26:07.622 --> 26:10.586
I like it. He's investing in himself.

26:10.588 --> 26:12.320
Suggests he can see

26:12.322 --> 26:13.654
beyond the obvious.

26:13.656 --> 26:15.787
And his relative success suggests

26:15.789 --> 26:17.387
that he may be a meaningful voice

26:17.389 --> 26:19.387
when it comes time for deliberations.

26:19.389 --> 26:22.521
You look at a body shop
and you see all that?

26:23.308 --> 26:25.722
I take my optimism
where I can find it, Benny.

26:25.724 --> 26:27.188
Don't rain on my parade.

26:27.190 --> 26:28.722
Don't you think it's kind of weird

26:28.724 --> 26:31.389
that he's starting renovations
by ripping up a sidewalk?

26:31.391 --> 26:33.888
I'm feeling drops, Mr. Colรณn.

26:33.890 --> 26:36.556
Do not start down this path.

26:37.324 --> 26:39.990
Anybody else feel like lunch?

26:39.992 --> 26:43.223
After responding to a 911 call
at the Harjo residence,

26:43.225 --> 26:44.223
what did you find?

26:44.225 --> 26:47.457
Pat Harjo was lying facedown, dead.

26:47.685 --> 26:49.557
Mack was standing over him.

26:49.559 --> 26:52.157
And Mack had Pat's blood in his clothes

26:52.159 --> 26:53.491
- and on his hands?
- Yes.

26:53.493 --> 26:54.791
Mack was

26:54.793 --> 26:56.725
the only other person
at the scene of the murder?

26:57.061 --> 26:58.591
Yes.

26:58.593 --> 27:00.424
Thank you for your service.

27:02.160 --> 27:03.891
So, the blood on Mack's hands,

27:03.893 --> 27:05.454
what does that indicate to you?

27:05.456 --> 27:08.425
Intimate contact with the body
after it was shot.

27:08.427 --> 27:11.360
And when you say "intimate
contact," could that mean

27:11.362 --> 27:14.593
checking for a pulse, both
at the wrist and the neck?

27:14.937 --> 27:15.960
It could.

27:15.961 --> 27:17.159
And, in fact,

27:17.161 --> 27:19.023
isn't that what the defendant told you

27:19.025 --> 27:20.460
after you arrested him,

27:20.462 --> 27:23.027
that he came upon the body

27:23.029 --> 27:25.261
and that he was trying
to determine whether

27:25.263 --> 27:27.527
his longtime friend was alive?

27:27.529 --> 27:29.734
That is what he told us, yes.

27:29.735 --> 27:32.134
When you found the defendant

27:32.136 --> 27:35.134
standing over the victim's body,
did you see the murder weapon?

27:35.136 --> 27:36.467
We did not.

27:36.469 --> 27:39.201
So is it your testimony that you believe

27:39.203 --> 27:42.335
that the defendant killed the victim,

27:42.337 --> 27:44.835
called the police, hid

27:44.837 --> 27:46.435
the murder weapon, but didn't bother

27:46.437 --> 27:48.635
to wash off any blood

27:48.637 --> 27:49.635
on his person?

27:49.637 --> 27:51.835
You're putting words in my mouth.

27:51.837 --> 27:54.269
My apologies, so soon after lunch.

27:55.605 --> 27:57.403
New question.

27:57.405 --> 28:00.270
The bullet that killed Pat was
a .3006 Springfield caliber,

28:00.272 --> 28:01.770
- correct?
- Yes.

28:02.109 --> 28:05.771
And isn't that one of the most
common calibers on the market?

28:06.606 --> 28:08.171
I suppose you could say that.

28:08.526 --> 28:11.566
More than 300 tribal
members on the reservation

28:11.568 --> 28:13.671
have a gun that will shoot
the caliber that matches

28:13.673 --> 28:16.371
that description, correct?

28:16.373 --> 28:18.304
Around there, yes.

28:18.306 --> 28:19.972
Thank you. Nothing further.

28:19.974 --> 28:21.694
Taima did good work.

28:22.274 --> 28:23.439
Where do you think

28:23.441 --> 28:24.639
Joe Chavis stands?

28:24.641 --> 28:26.105
It's hard to tell.

28:26.107 --> 28:27.862
Good poker player.

28:34.542 --> 28:38.540
Stop looking back at the victim's widow.

28:39.113 --> 28:40.374
You're drawing the jury's attention

28:40.376 --> 28:43.474
to her tears and doing
the other side's work for them.

28:45.109 --> 28:46.307
Thank you.

28:46.309 --> 28:47.975
And if there's anything else you can do

28:47.977 --> 28:51.242
to help me save your life,
it would be much appreciated.

28:51.822 --> 28:54.709
You can read everyone
at that table, can't you?

28:54.711 --> 28:56.990
Can read almost anybody.

28:57.411 --> 28:58.542
Except my own client.

29:00.240 --> 29:02.209
You were pretty rough on him today.

29:03.078 --> 29:04.365
I know.

29:07.178 --> 29:09.476
Any chance I can persuade you to...

29:09.478 --> 29:11.177
call your own car?

29:11.179 --> 29:14.010
I think maybe I ought to stop by Mack's.

29:14.012 --> 29:15.611
Apologize.

29:16.074 --> 29:17.611
Buck him up.

29:49.050 --> 29:51.114
It's Mack. Start talking.

29:51.116 --> 29:54.248
Hey, Mack, I'm at your front
door, and you're not here.

29:54.537 --> 29:56.348
You're out on bail, my friend,

29:56.350 --> 29:58.615
bail bought and paid for with my money.

29:58.617 --> 30:00.648
You're not supposed to be out
raising hell.

30:00.650 --> 30:03.848
Give me a call when you can.

30:16.585 --> 30:18.784
Of course.

30:21.453 --> 30:23.651
Mack.

30:43.722 --> 30:45.783
Damn it to hell, Mack.

30:54.340 --> 30:56.168
Cut this man off.

30:58.674 --> 31:00.649
Hot damn, J.B.

31:00.674 --> 31:02.549
How'd you find me?

31:02.550 --> 31:04.081
You've got a phone...
I've got a young lady

31:04.083 --> 31:05.548
who can find you.

31:06.294 --> 31:08.982
She said the last call you made
was to a boat rental outfit

31:08.984 --> 31:10.416
here on the river.

31:10.418 --> 31:11.916
That's truly impressive.

31:13.485 --> 31:15.850
I'm guessing you rented a boat

31:15.852 --> 31:18.983
and you don't plan to return it.

31:18.985 --> 31:22.883
And you're adding fugitive and
grand larceny to your rap sheet?

31:23.463 --> 31:25.250
You should be on Jeopardy!

31:25.755 --> 31:27.684
I'd already be gone...

31:27.686 --> 31:29.084
but the weather looks bad.

31:29.086 --> 31:31.051
I don't know who's the bigger fool...

31:31.546 --> 31:33.618
you or me.

31:34.005 --> 31:35.785
You know what happens next, right?

31:35.787 --> 31:38.551
You hole up in Canada or
wherever it is you're headed,

31:38.553 --> 31:41.718
the cops'll look for you
for a while, but then...

31:42.256 --> 31:43.919
they'll decide you're
not worth the trouble.

31:43.921 --> 31:45.920
So far this is sounding pretty good.

31:45.922 --> 31:47.986
But then you'll do something stupid.

31:47.988 --> 31:50.387
You'll get drunk or get in a fight

31:50.389 --> 31:53.053
or you'll con money
off the wrong person,

31:53.055 --> 31:54.920
and they will put you away for good,

31:54.922 --> 31:57.287
and they will charge you
with everything you ever did

31:57.289 --> 31:59.487
and a bunch of stuff you didn't.

31:59.489 --> 32:02.121
And it'll stick, and
you will take the fall.

32:02.123 --> 32:04.454
Just like I did in college?

32:04.456 --> 32:06.221
I see.

32:06.223 --> 32:08.254
Is it Nostalgia Night here
at the Last Dive Bar.

32:08.256 --> 32:10.155
Before the Interstate Pub and Grub?

32:10.157 --> 32:12.422
Apparently I can never
repay you for this

32:12.424 --> 32:16.155
extraordinarily selfless deed
you committed on my behalf.

32:17.092 --> 32:19.422
The part we always leave out is that

32:19.424 --> 32:21.189
you hadn't gone to class in
a month and they were gonna

32:21.191 --> 32:22.926
kick you out anyway.

32:28.178 --> 32:29.957
I'm done.

32:29.959 --> 32:32.657
Okay? I put 100 grand up for your bail

32:32.659 --> 32:35.858
and I am reasonably certain
I'll never see it again.

32:36.303 --> 32:38.428
So I'd say we're even.

32:39.593 --> 32:41.025
Now I'm gonna go get some sleep.

32:41.027 --> 32:43.625
At least one of us should
show up in court tomorrow.

32:46.679 --> 32:49.259
Dr. Bull. Bull, wake up.

32:51.261 --> 32:53.226
Bull. Hey.

32:53.725 --> 32:55.059
Sorry to wake you.

32:55.061 --> 32:56.893
I was going through the
casino's incident reports

32:56.895 --> 32:59.545
last night and, came across
something interesting.

32:59.547 --> 33:01.098
Something I think
you're gonna want to know

33:01.100 --> 33:02.331
before going into court.

33:04.832 --> 33:07.030
- Or not.
- Sorry.

33:07.032 --> 33:08.848
I'm not actually sure I care.

33:10.012 --> 33:11.311
You're the boss.

33:11.533 --> 33:14.223
No. No, I want to hear.

33:16.466 --> 33:18.264
Okay, maybe it's nothing.

33:18.266 --> 33:20.931
But when I was talking to Koi,
he mentioned that the casino

33:20.933 --> 33:24.532
had a car theft problem.
106 thefts in the last year,

33:24.534 --> 33:27.432
30 in the last eight weeks
before Pat was murdered.

33:27.434 --> 33:29.598
All taken from the same back parking lot

33:29.600 --> 33:31.299
at roughly the same time of night.

33:31.301 --> 33:33.865
All highend, easyto-
trace luxury vehicles.

33:33.867 --> 33:34.916
Okay.

33:34.917 --> 33:36.583
And then Pat installed cameras

33:36.585 --> 33:38.050
and added patrols,

33:38.052 --> 33:39.851
and the thefts suddenly stopped.

33:40.286 --> 33:41.484
Makes me think someone

33:41.486 --> 33:43.450
is no longer making a lot of money.

33:43.452 --> 33:46.851
I'm following you, but I'm not
sure where we're going.

33:46.853 --> 33:49.617
Highend luxury cars are
worth a lot more in pieces

33:49.619 --> 33:51.084
than they are assembled.

33:51.086 --> 33:53.051
That's how you monetize
them... you sell the parts.

33:53.053 --> 33:54.884
Easy to move, impossible to trace.

33:54.886 --> 33:57.285
But you need a place
to take the cars apart.

33:57.287 --> 33:59.752
- Still not caring.
- There are only

33:59.754 --> 34:01.286
a small number of facilities

34:01.288 --> 34:03.152
with the space and the tools

34:03.154 --> 34:05.252
needed to do the job
in and around the reservation,

34:05.254 --> 34:08.452
and only one on the reservation itself.

34:08.454 --> 34:10.686
Belongs to a guy named Joe Chavis.

34:13.589 --> 34:14.609
Excuse me?

34:14.610 --> 34:17.047
You mean our Joe Chavis...
the one on the jury?

34:17.049 --> 34:19.244
Unless there's another
Joe Chavis on the reservation.

34:19.246 --> 34:22.080
Well, we know he owns an auto repair
shop. We were there yesterday.

34:22.081 --> 34:24.647
Yeah, but it doesn't mean
he owns the auto repair shop

34:24.649 --> 34:26.981
that's been chopping up these cars,

34:26.983 --> 34:28.947
and it's not like we can ask him.

34:28.949 --> 34:30.947
That would be jury tampering.

34:30.949 --> 34:32.014
Even on the reservation?

34:32.016 --> 34:33.565
Even on the reservation.

34:34.117 --> 34:36.614
Pretty clever if it's true, though.

34:36.617 --> 34:38.915
Kill a man, frame someone else,

34:38.917 --> 34:40.416
then volunteer to be on the jury

34:40.418 --> 34:42.116
that's trying the person you set up?

34:42.735 --> 34:43.815
When we get to the courthouse,

34:43.817 --> 34:45.382
you keep the car.

34:45.384 --> 34:47.516
Driver'll take you
over to Joe Chavis' Auto Body.

34:47.518 --> 34:49.916
Take a look around, see
if he's operating a chop shop.

34:49.918 --> 34:53.016
If he is... give me a call.

34:53.018 --> 34:55.283
Meantime, I'll do everything
I can to stall in the courtroom

34:55.284 --> 34:56.449
until I hear back from you.

34:56.452 --> 34:58.550
And if you happen
to see a rifle that fires

34:58.552 --> 35:01.118
.3006 Springfield bullets lying around,

35:01.120 --> 35:03.051
I'd love to hear about that, too.

35:03.401 --> 35:06.017
Is the defendant not in attendance?

35:06.019 --> 35:09.451
We're reaching out to him as we speak.

35:09.453 --> 35:11.952
When I spoke to him
last night he said he wasn't...

35:11.954 --> 35:13.352
feeling very well.

35:13.354 --> 35:15.586
May we beg the Court's indulgence?

35:15.588 --> 35:17.686
The Court will take a onehour recess.

35:17.688 --> 35:20.786
And if, at that time,
the defendant is not present,

35:20.986 --> 35:23.253
we will commence closing arguments

35:23.255 --> 35:26.353
and I will issue a
warrant for his arrest

35:26.355 --> 35:28.587
on contempt of court charges.

35:34.423 --> 35:35.821
Anything you want to share?

35:35.823 --> 35:36.988
No.

35:50.191 --> 35:52.589
Let's take a minute and go over
your closing arguments, okay?

35:53.692 --> 35:54.922
Danny?

35:54.924 --> 35:57.656
Hey. This place is locked up
tighter than a vault.

35:57.658 --> 35:59.823
There's nobody here.
There's nothing going on.

35:59.825 --> 36:02.290
There's no sign on the door,
no explanation why.

36:02.292 --> 36:05.457
You know, it's almost as if
they knew that we were looking

36:05.459 --> 36:07.958
at those incident reports and
starting to figure things out.

36:07.960 --> 36:10.991
Maybe they do know.
Maybe someone told them.

36:10.993 --> 36:12.691
Like who... Koi from casino security?

36:12.693 --> 36:15.525
You need to lead with the fact thatthat

36:15.527 --> 36:17.125
there's no murder weapon.
Did you talk to the guys

36:17.127 --> 36:18.725
working the sidewalk?
Maybe they know something.

36:18.727 --> 36:20.625
There's no weapon
to tie him to the crime.

36:20.627 --> 36:21.859
Bull, what guys?

36:21.861 --> 36:23.226
I told you, there's nobody here.

36:23.228 --> 36:24.493
And the sidewalk's done.

36:24.495 --> 36:26.826
In fact, it's just a little, tiny part.

36:26.828 --> 36:28.359
Just a little square.

36:31.129 --> 36:32.793
Danny, stay right there.

36:32.795 --> 36:34.093
I'm gonna talk to the chief.

36:34.095 --> 36:36.127
I got to get permission to do something.

36:40.036 --> 36:42.628
It's Mack. Start talking.

36:42.630 --> 36:44.161
Hey, man.

36:44.163 --> 36:45.994
Maybe I should have
begged you last night.

36:45.996 --> 36:47.728
Sorry.

36:47.730 --> 36:50.728
I let my anger get the best of me.

36:50.730 --> 36:52.329
But this is one of those moments.

36:52.331 --> 36:53.895
You can actually do the right thing

36:53.897 --> 36:55.963
even though you've already
done the wrong thing.

36:56.579 --> 36:58.529
If you're not too far away, turn around.

36:58.531 --> 36:59.746
Come back.

37:00.398 --> 37:01.829
Get to court.

37:02.288 --> 37:04.610
Mack is unquestionably the killer.

37:05.138 --> 37:07.263
He had means, he had motive.

37:07.265 --> 37:09.396
He had the blood of the victim
on his body,

37:09.398 --> 37:11.097
and he has no alibi.

37:11.099 --> 37:13.797
And if you're at all unsure
about his guilt...

37:13.799 --> 37:17.131
well, he's done you the favor
of leaving town

37:17.133 --> 37:18.731
in the middle of the night.

37:19.539 --> 37:22.065
Clearly the act of a guilty man.

37:22.067 --> 37:25.132
So let's put this matter
to rest, once and for all,

37:25.134 --> 37:27.198
and convict him.

37:27.200 --> 37:29.365
Then let the police do their job

37:29.367 --> 37:31.632
and catch him, so we can lock him up

37:31.634 --> 37:35.266
and make sure that he never
hurts anybody again.

37:35.625 --> 37:37.000
Thank you.

37:37.502 --> 37:38.967
You know, it's easy to dislike Mack.

37:39.958 --> 37:41.867
He spends too much time in the casino,

37:41.869 --> 37:44.900
he gets too loud, he gets too drunk,

37:45.668 --> 37:47.501
seems to care more about having fun

37:47.503 --> 37:49.464
than being a good friend or

37:49.466 --> 37:51.001
a good citizen.

37:51.703 --> 37:53.468
None of that matters

37:53.470 --> 37:56.235
and none of that means
that he's a murderer.

37:56.585 --> 37:58.602
Ladies and gentlemen,

37:58.604 --> 38:01.136
there is simply no hard evidence

38:01.138 --> 38:03.136
to back up the assertion

38:03.138 --> 38:05.569
that Mack is the man
responsible for this killing.

38:05.571 --> 38:09.003
Yes, they found him
standing over the body,

38:09.005 --> 38:11.070
but that's because he called the police.

38:11.072 --> 38:13.903
And, to date, the murder
weapon has not been found.

38:13.905 --> 38:16.504
So are we gonna convict somebody

38:16.506 --> 38:17.871
just because we don't like him?

38:19.313 --> 38:21.037
And, for that matter,

38:21.039 --> 38:24.304
has anyone demonstrated any real motive?

38:24.306 --> 38:26.471
If you believe Mack is a killer,

38:26.473 --> 38:29.338
then you believe he murdered Pat,

38:29.340 --> 38:31.272
a man he'd known for most of his life,

38:31.274 --> 38:34.606
because he banned him
from playing poker...

38:35.063 --> 38:36.672
a situation that killing Pat

38:36.674 --> 38:38.606
would not remedy.

38:38.608 --> 38:40.373
It just doesn't make any sense.

38:40.689 --> 38:42.406
Ask yourself

38:43.106 --> 38:45.974
who does this make sense for?

38:45.976 --> 38:49.406
Maybe someone who made a small fortune

38:49.408 --> 38:50.974
stealing cars,

38:50.976 --> 38:52.707
chopping them up,

38:52.709 --> 38:54.907
and selling them for parts.

38:54.909 --> 38:57.108
Someone who Pat

38:57.110 --> 38:59.275
was determined to stop.

38:59.277 --> 39:01.208
That's the person
who has motive to kill Pat.

39:01.210 --> 39:03.122
For real money,

39:03.147 --> 39:06.025
not for some poker hands.

39:11.211 --> 39:13.476
Forgive the interruption, Chief,
but with the help

39:13.478 --> 39:15.510
of Officer Abeita, the tribal police,

39:15.512 --> 39:16.977
and with your permission,

39:16.979 --> 39:20.177
we dug up the sidewalk in front
of Joe Chavis' Auto Body,

39:20.179 --> 39:22.377
and, lo and behold,
discovered this rifle.

39:25.844 --> 39:27.611
In light of this new evidence,

39:27.613 --> 39:30.145
and as we wait for forensic testing,

39:30.147 --> 39:31.545
the defense suggests

39:31.547 --> 39:33.512
that we stop this current trial.

39:38.747 --> 39:39.979
I agree.

39:39.981 --> 39:42.179
And, in addition,

39:42.181 --> 39:43.379
that the Court

39:43.381 --> 39:45.833
issue a warrant for Joe Chavis

39:45.835 --> 39:48.880
in the murder of Patwin Harjo.

39:53.215 --> 39:55.914
A warrant is hereby issued.

39:55.916 --> 39:57.081
No, you can't be serious.

39:57.083 --> 39:58.914
Theythey can't just dig up my sidewalk.

39:58.916 --> 40:00.747
- That evidence was planted.
- Well, we'll find out

40:00.749 --> 40:03.214
soon enough, Mr. Chavis.

40:03.216 --> 40:05.414
- Take him down to holding, please.
- This is crazy.

40:05.416 --> 40:08.048
Okay? Mack's the killer.

40:08.050 --> 40:09.581
Mack's the killer.

40:09.583 --> 40:11.882
Mack... Everyone knows
Mack is the killer.

40:12.765 --> 40:14.182
- Please.
- Gonna radio it in.

40:14.184 --> 40:15.782
Get your hands off me,
you have the wrong guy.

40:15.784 --> 40:17.883
Well, it was nice working with you.

40:17.885 --> 40:19.716
The pleasure was all mine.

40:20.297 --> 40:21.682
Thank you.

40:44.587 --> 40:46.102
What are the odds?

40:48.573 --> 40:49.952
The odds of what?

40:51.221 --> 40:52.952
The odds that Chavis would buckle

40:52.954 --> 40:55.186
and confess to killing Pat?

40:56.188 --> 40:58.187
You pulled a royal flush.

40:58.937 --> 41:00.087
And by the way,

41:00.672 --> 41:02.454
he had help.

41:02.456 --> 41:03.687
Koi.

41:03.689 --> 41:05.487
They were actually both
in on it together.

41:05.489 --> 41:08.454
In fact, it was Koi who texted Chavis

41:08.456 --> 41:11.088
when Pat was on his way
back home that night.

41:11.090 --> 41:13.854
And it was Chavis who texted you
after killing Pat

41:13.856 --> 41:15.855
to come over and make peace

41:15.857 --> 41:18.522
so he could frame you for the murder.

41:19.064 --> 41:20.655
You going somewhere?

41:20.657 --> 41:22.022
I just won you your freedom...

41:22.024 --> 41:23.656
that seems counterintuitive.

41:23.658 --> 41:26.189
You ever been to Tunica, Mississippi?

41:28.025 --> 41:29.990
Riverboat casinos.

41:29.992 --> 41:31.490
Fresh start.

41:31.492 --> 41:33.157
Nobody knows me there.

41:34.659 --> 41:36.524
You look disappointed.

41:38.193 --> 41:40.324
It's who I am, Bull.

41:43.460 --> 41:45.625
And I love who you are.

41:45.627 --> 41:48.558
But you're never
gonna hit that jackpot, man.

41:49.994 --> 41:53.459
You know a lot of stuff,
but you don't know that.

42:02.828 --> 42:04.793
We're even.

42:05.151 --> 42:06.994
If you say so.

42:08.962 --> 42:11.027
But we're still friends.

42:11.595 --> 42:13.985
I'm still taking your calls.

42:14.897 --> 42:16.161
I'm still here for you.

42:16.569 --> 42:18.361
I know that.
