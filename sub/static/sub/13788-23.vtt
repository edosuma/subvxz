WEBVTT

00:05.256 --> 00:07.258
TOMORROW, I'M GOING
TO THE GROOMER.

00:07.258 --> 00:09.340
A LITTLE TRIM,
A LITTLE BLOWOUT.

00:09.340 --> 00:11.262
GONNA BE A FULL DAY
OF BEAUTY.

00:11.262 --> 00:13.224
NOT THAT YOU CAN
IMPROVE ON PERFECTION.

00:13.224 --> 00:14.975
TSK, TSK.

00:14.975 --> 00:16.557
I JUST HOPE
I DON'T MISS ANY FUN.

00:16.557 --> 00:19.270
THE KIDS DO SOME
CRAZY THINGS AROUND HERE.

00:21.692 --> 00:24.445
WELL, THAT WAS WEIRD.

00:57.678 --> 01:01.102
FINALLY, A MOVIE
WE CAN ALL WATCH.

01:01.102 --> 01:03.394
A HIGH OCTANE
ACTION ADVENTURE...

01:03.394 --> 01:04.855
ROMANTIC COMEDY...

01:04.855 --> 01:06.357
WITH RAINBOW PONIES.

01:07.948 --> 01:10.401
- ( Stan sneezes )
- All: BLESS YOU.

01:10.401 --> 01:11.822
All: WHAT?

01:11.822 --> 01:13.904
IT CAME FROM
OVER HERE.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.622
- KARL?!
- YOU'RE SPYING ON US?

01:21.622 --> 01:24.335
WHAT? NO.

01:24.335 --> 01:27.128
OKAY, MAYBE A LITTLE.

01:27.128 --> 01:29.590
I'M GONNA SEND
THIS PHOTO TO YOUR MOTHER.

01:29.590 --> 01:32.343
NO, DON'T.
MOTHER HATES WHEN I SPY.

01:32.343 --> 01:34.215
SHE ALSO HATES
WHEN I CHILLAX,

01:34.215 --> 01:36.517
AND THE FACT THAT I WAS
CHILLAXING WHILE SPYING

01:36.517 --> 01:38.429
WOULD INFURIATE HER.

01:38.429 --> 01:39.980
IF YOU TELL HER,

01:39.980 --> 01:41.562
I'LL TELL EVERYONE
YOUR BIG SECRET.

01:45.356 --> 01:47.728
BIG SECRET?
THERE'S NO BIG SECRET.

01:47.728 --> 01:50.030
THAT'S CRAZY.

01:50.030 --> 01:52.153
THAT SHOULD BE MADE OBVIOUS

01:52.153 --> 01:54.695
BY THE ABSURDLY LARGE AMOUNT
OF LAUGHING I'M DOING RIGHT NOW.

01:56.367 --> 01:59.370
OKAY, I ADMIT,
THERE'S A SECRET.

01:59.370 --> 02:01.502
I PLAY THE AIR BANJO.

02:01.502 --> 02:04.044
( imitates plucking
banjo strings )

02:05.876 --> 02:07.298
THAT'S NOT A SECRET.

02:07.298 --> 02:10.421
YOU INVITED ME TO YOUR
COUNTRY AIR JAMBOREE.

02:10.421 --> 02:12.593
OH, YEAH.
THANKS FOR COMING.

02:12.593 --> 02:14.134
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

02:15.256 --> 02:18.849
THE SECRET
I'M REFERRING TO IS,

02:18.849 --> 02:22.643
I KNOW YOUR DOG STAN
CAN TALK.

02:41.282 --> 02:45.496
STAN CAN'T TALK.
THAT IS RIDICULOUS, KARL.

02:45.496 --> 02:47.127
ISN'T THAT RIDICULOUS,
TYLER?

02:47.127 --> 02:49.129
YEAH, YOU MIGHT
AS WELL SAY

02:49.129 --> 02:52.052
THAT WE HAVE A BEAR
WHO COOKS GRILLED
CHEESE SANDWICHES.

02:52.052 --> 02:54.715
WHY DID I SAY THAT?
NOW I WANT A GRILLED
CHEESE SANDWICH.

02:54.715 --> 02:57.007
I WISH WE HAD A BEAR.

02:57.007 --> 02:59.640
PLEASE, I'M NOT STUPID.

02:59.640 --> 03:01.302
I'M THE ONLY PERSON
IN THE WORLD

03:01.302 --> 03:03.063
WHO POSSESSES
A KARL FINK-LEVEL INTELLECT

03:03.063 --> 03:04.975
ON THE KARL FINK
SCALE OF INTELLECTS

03:04.975 --> 03:07.808
ONE TO KARL FINK,
KARL FINK BEING THE HIGHEST.

03:07.808 --> 03:09.940
IF MY LAST NAME
WERE FINK,

03:09.940 --> 03:12.273
I DON'T THINK I'D SAY IT
AS OFTEN AS YOU DO.

03:12.273 --> 03:13.984
I'VE SENSED FOR A WHILE

03:13.984 --> 03:15.986
THAT SOMETHING WAS
AMISS REGARDING STAN,

03:15.986 --> 03:19.740
SO I LAUNCHED OPERATION:
KARL FINDS OUT STAN'S SECRET.

03:19.740 --> 03:21.912
IT'S NOT A CLEVER TITLE,
BUT IT REALLY DRAWS YOU IN

03:21.912 --> 03:24.455
BY TELLING YOU
EXACTLY WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

03:24.455 --> 03:26.957
AND I'VE SEEN
SOME AMAZING THINGS.

04:03.123 --> 04:07.828
SERIOUSLY, NO ONE NOTICES
THAT A DOG IS DEEJAYING?!

04:09.370 --> 04:10.461
STILL PROVES NOTHING.

04:10.461 --> 04:12.333
PLENTY OF DOGS
WHO CAN'T TALK

04:12.333 --> 04:14.585
DEEJAY, GO ON SPY MISSIONS,
DANCE IN CLOGS,

04:14.585 --> 04:16.256
PUNCH GROWN MEN IN THE FACE,

04:16.256 --> 04:18.258
LINT BRUSH SOFAS
AND DRIVE CARS.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.341
- THEY DO?
- OF COURSE. YES.

04:20.341 --> 04:22.303
NOT COUNTING CARTOONS?

04:22.303 --> 04:24.385
NO, PROBABLY NOT AS MANY.

04:27.227 --> 04:29.350
HI, HON, DON'T
MEAN TO INTERRUPT.

04:29.350 --> 04:31.271
SO YOU'RE STILL
WRITING YOUR BOOK

04:31.271 --> 04:33.023
ON BLENDED FAMILIES, HUH?

04:33.023 --> 04:36.397
YEAH, THAT IS GREAT.
JUST GREAT.

04:36.397 --> 04:40.361
REALLY, REALLY GREAT.

04:40.361 --> 04:41.322
WHAT IS IT?

04:41.322 --> 04:43.073
I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

04:43.073 --> 04:44.665
HOW TO TELL MY HUSBAND
I'M CONCERNED

04:44.665 --> 04:46.457
HE'S GOING TO TELL STORIES
IN HIS BOOK

04:46.457 --> 04:48.078
THAT MAKE OUR FAMILY
LOOK FOOLISH,

04:48.078 --> 04:50.040
BUT HOW DO I DO THAT?

04:50.040 --> 04:53.874
HOW DO I DO THAT?

04:53.874 --> 04:57.257
- WHEN HAVE WE EVER
LOOKED FOOLISH?
- WELL...

05:17.738 --> 05:19.900
MAMA'S GOIN' DOWN!

05:21.532 --> 05:24.905
SO WE HAVE FUN.
I WOULDN'T SAY
WE'RE OVER THE TOP.

05:24.905 --> 05:26.617
EXACTLY. YOU WOULDN'T,

05:26.617 --> 05:29.410
WHICH IS WHY I NEED TO HAVE
SOME INPUT ON THIS PROJECT

05:29.410 --> 05:32.042
- SOME INPUT?
- YES. I CAN'T JUST BE

05:32.042 --> 05:34.755
YOUR BEAUTIFUL
AND ALLURING MUSE.

05:34.755 --> 05:37.378
I NEED TO BE INVOLVED
IN THE WRITING.

05:37.378 --> 05:39.510
LIKE I'M...
RIDING SHOTGUN WITH YOU.

05:39.510 --> 05:41.882
( laughs )
LITERARY ONE, ELLEN.

05:44.925 --> 05:46.727
OF COURSE, THERE'S
THAT TIME IN THE PARK.

06:17.918 --> 06:21.552
THE DOG JUST DANCED THE TANGO,
AND NO ONE IS QUESTIONING IT?!

06:23.504 --> 06:26.006
YOU STILL HAVEN'T TOLD US
ONE TIME STAN WAS TALKING.

06:26.006 --> 06:27.928
LET'S CUT TO
THE CHASE THEN, SHALL WE?

06:27.928 --> 06:30.931
- I WAS THERE WHEN...
- WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT?

06:30.931 --> 06:32.392
WOULD YOU GIVE ME
A SECOND?

06:32.392 --> 06:34.144
I'M WONDERING
IF I SHOULD TALK.

06:44.154 --> 06:45.486
THAT WAS ALL
YOUR IMAGINATION.

06:45.486 --> 06:47.948
I DON'T HAVE
AN IMAGINATION.

06:47.948 --> 06:49.830
THAT'S SO SAD.

06:49.830 --> 06:52.332
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I WOULD DO WITHOUT
MY IMAGINARY FRIEND.

06:52.332 --> 06:54.414
RIGHT, MRS. GRIMMONS?

06:54.414 --> 06:57.297
( exaggerated
British accent )
RIGHT YOU ARE, CHLOE.

06:58.298 --> 06:59.840
MAYBE WHAT YOU HEARD

06:59.840 --> 07:01.502
WAS LIKE SOMETHING ON
THE INTERNET

07:01.502 --> 07:03.804
WHERE A DOG HOWLS AND IT
SOUNDS LIKE HE'S SAYING

07:03.804 --> 07:05.385
I LOVE YOU.

07:05.385 --> 07:07.427
GOOD IDEA, TYLER.
I MEAN...

07:07.427 --> 07:10.010
THAT COULD BE IT.
LIKE THIS.

07:10.010 --> 07:11.722
I ROVE YOU.

07:11.722 --> 07:14.434
All: I ROVE YOU.

07:15.726 --> 07:17.648
WELL...

07:17.648 --> 07:20.320

HE DID THIS?

08:19.119 --> 08:20.751
FINE, KARL.

08:20.751 --> 08:22.462
YOU KNOW STAN'S SECRET.

08:22.462 --> 08:24.795
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF.

08:24.795 --> 08:28.008
AVERY JENNINGS, DO YOU
HONESTLY THINK

08:28.008 --> 08:30.681
THAT KARL FINK, YOUR
SUPERIOR IN EVERY WAY,

08:30.681 --> 08:33.393
OTHER THAN RACQUETBALL,
BECAUSE YOU SOMEHOW MANAGE

08:33.393 --> 08:35.395
TO DART ABOUT THE COURT
LIKE A JACKRABBIT,

08:35.395 --> 08:39.399
DIDN'T MAKE RECORDINGS
OF STAN TALKING?
( laughs )

08:39.399 --> 08:40.811
WELL, IF YOU HAVE RECORDINGS,

08:40.811 --> 08:43.063
WHY HAVEN'T YOU
USED THEM AGAINST US?

08:43.063 --> 08:44.985
BECAUSE SOMETHING THIS BIG,

08:44.985 --> 08:48.318
YOU WAIT FOR EXACTLY
THE RIGHT MOMENT.

08:48.318 --> 08:50.110
HOPEFULLY FRIDAY,
SO I CAN SAVOR IT

08:50.110 --> 08:51.742
OVER THE WEEKEND.

08:51.742 --> 08:55.155
TOOTS. YES, I WAS HERE
FOR THAT, TOO.

08:55.155 --> 08:57.367
- TOOTS.
- IS THAT SHORT
FOR TOODLE-OO?

08:57.367 --> 08:59.750
NO, I FARTED.

08:59.750 --> 09:02.212
THOUGH THIS TIME,
IT WAS SHORT FOR TOODLE-OO.

09:02.212 --> 09:04.424
CONSIDER YOURSELVES LUCKY.

09:05.666 --> 09:07.377
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

09:07.377 --> 09:10.380
IF WE GO UP TO THE WOODS,
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND A BEAR.

09:10.380 --> 09:14.434
I'M SORRY. I REALLY
WANT GRILLED CHEESE.

09:14.434 --> 09:17.177
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO
ABOUT HIM, MRS. GRIMMONS?

09:17.177 --> 09:20.230
NOT MUCH WE CAN DO...

09:20.230 --> 09:24.985
ONE LITTLE GIRL
AND AN IMAGINARY CHAMBERMAID.

09:28.358 --> 09:30.450
BENNETT, ARE YOU
THE TYPE OF PERSON

09:30.450 --> 09:33.784
THAT LIKES THE BANDAGE
RIPPED OFF SLOWLY OR QUICKLY?

09:33.784 --> 09:35.195
- QUICKLY.
- YOUR BOOK STINKS.

09:36.867 --> 09:40.200
- SLOWLY.
- ( speaking slowly )
YOUR BOOK STINKS.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.752
BUT I HAVE A SOLUTION.

09:41.752 --> 09:44.204
I'M GOING TO CO-WRITE
THE BOOK WITH YOU.

09:44.204 --> 09:47.207
I'VE JOTTED DOWN
SOME GREAT STORIES
ABOUT MY MOTHERING EXPERTISE.

09:47.207 --> 09:50.380
REMEMBER THAT TIME
YOU AND TYLER WEREN'T
COMMUNICATING?

09:51.341 --> 09:53.303
AS I REMEMBER IT...

09:53.303 --> 09:54.675
YOU TWO NEED TO TALK.

09:54.675 --> 09:56.637
COMMUNICATION IS THE LEGS
TO THE LOVE TABLE

09:56.637 --> 09:58.428
AROUND WHICH WE
AS A FAMILY EAT.

09:58.428 --> 09:59.980
BRILLIANT, HONEY.

10:01.892 --> 10:04.224
SON, I AM AWED BY
YOUR MOTHER'S TABLE METAPHOR,

10:04.224 --> 10:07.988
AND ASHAMED THAT I SOMETIMES
FAIL TO HEED HER WISE COUNSEL.

10:07.988 --> 10:10.030
LOVE EACH OTHER.

10:11.732 --> 10:13.323
MOM'S RIGHT, AND SMART
AND BEAUTIFUL,

10:13.323 --> 10:15.736
AND WITTY AS ALL GET-OUT,

10:15.736 --> 10:18.198
WITH THE VOICE OF AN ANGEL
AND THE HEART OF A SAINT.

10:18.198 --> 10:20.000
HOW DID SOMEONE LIKE YOU
LAND SAINT MOMMY?

10:20.000 --> 10:23.664
DON'T PINCH ME, LEST I WAKE
FROM THIS WONDERFUL DREAM.

10:25.165 --> 10:26.246
SO THAT GOES
IN THE BOOK.

10:26.246 --> 10:29.009
( laughs )
ARE YOU KIDDING?

10:29.009 --> 10:31.341
THAT IS NOT HOW IT HAPPENED.
IT HAPPENED LIKE THIS.

10:31.341 --> 10:33.423
BENNETT, I AM JUST
A FLIBBERTY-GIBBET

10:33.423 --> 10:36.426
WHO NEEDS HER MUSCLY ARMED
SMART MAN TO GUIDE OUR FAMILY

10:36.426 --> 10:38.098
IN WAYS THAT I CANNOT.

10:38.098 --> 10:39.559
I AM MUSCLEY-ARMED.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.063
AND BRILLIANT, SON.

10:43.063 --> 10:44.685
WHY YOU SPOKE TO

10:44.685 --> 10:47.227
THE FLIBBERTY-GIBBET
IN THE FIRST PLACE
DEFIES REASON.

10:47.227 --> 10:49.609
HIS ABS ARE
MUSCLY TOO.

10:49.609 --> 10:53.193
MOM'S RIGHT.
YOU ARE THE MOST FIT
AND THE MOST BRILLIANT

10:53.193 --> 10:55.275
OF ALL THE FATHERS
IN MY AGE COHORT.

10:55.275 --> 10:57.617
WE FREQUENTLY TALK
ABOUT IT AT SCHOOL,
AS DO THE TEACHERS,

10:57.617 --> 10:59.369
IN CASE YOU WERE WONDERING.

10:59.369 --> 11:02.332
WHO AM I TO ARGUE
WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE RIGHT?

11:04.334 --> 11:05.956
YOU MIS-REMEMBERED
THE WHOLE THING.

11:05.956 --> 11:08.548
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
TO LAUGH OR BE INSULTED,

11:08.548 --> 11:11.211
SO I'LL DO BOTH.
HA HA... HEY.

11:14.755 --> 11:16.757
OKAY, THERE AREN'T
ANY VENTS IN HERE,

11:16.757 --> 11:18.348
SO WE CAN TALK WITHOUT
KARL HEARING.

11:18.348 --> 11:20.640
I'M SO GLAD STAN'S AT
THE DOGGIE DAY SPA.

11:20.640 --> 11:23.223
ALL THIS TALK ABOUT
HIS SECRET WOULD
REALLY STRESS HIM OUT.

11:23.223 --> 11:27.107
PLUS, HE ALWAYS COMES BACK
WITH JUICY GROOMER GOSSIP.

11:27.107 --> 11:31.151
THE WILSONS' IRISH SETTER...
DYE JOB.

11:31.151 --> 11:34.364
CHLOE, WE ALL ENJOY
STAN'S DOG DISH.

11:34.364 --> 11:37.697
( laughs )
I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO THAT.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.619
BUT WE NEED TO STAY FOCUSED.

11:39.619 --> 11:42.322
HOW ARE WE GONNA KEEP KARL
FROM REVEALING STAN'S SECRET?

11:42.322 --> 11:45.535
I KNOW. WHAT IF WE COVER
KARL WITH PIGEON FEATHERS?

11:45.535 --> 11:47.958
THEN, WHEN HE TRIES TO
TELL PEOPLE THAT STAN CAN TALK,

11:47.958 --> 11:50.330
- NO ONE WILL BELIEVE HIM.
- WHAT? WHY?

11:50.330 --> 11:53.383
WOULD YOU BELIEVE
A PIGEON MAN?

11:53.383 --> 11:55.295
I THINK I WOULD.

11:55.295 --> 11:58.338
LOOK, KARL WAS AFRAID
WE'D SEND THOSE PICTURES OF HIM

11:58.338 --> 12:00.100
TO HIS MOM.

12:00.100 --> 12:02.682
WHAT IF WE TELL HER
HE'S BEEN SPYING ON US,

12:02.682 --> 12:05.345
AND ASK HER TO DELETE
THE VIDEO RECORDINGS
ON HIS COMPUTER?

12:05.345 --> 12:07.938
- WHAT IF SHE LOOKS AT THEM?
- WE HAVE TO HOPE
THAT SHE WON'T.

12:07.938 --> 12:09.349
IT'S OUR ONLY OPTION.

12:09.349 --> 12:11.351
GUESS WE'RE BETTER OFF
TRUSTING KARL'S MOM

12:11.351 --> 12:13.483
TO DESTROY THE RECORDINGS
THAN WE ARE TRUSTING KARL.

12:13.483 --> 12:16.276
- STOP!
- ( all screaming )

12:17.407 --> 12:19.199
YOU WERE LISTENING TO US?!

12:19.199 --> 12:22.702
I JUST CRAWLED IN AT THE END.
YOUR HOUSE IS NOT SECURE.

12:22.702 --> 12:25.325
DO NOT TEXT MY MOTHER
ABOUT THE RECORDINGS.

12:25.325 --> 12:26.626
TOO LATE, KARL.

12:26.626 --> 12:28.628
WE FIGURED OUT A WAY
TO STOP YOU.

12:28.628 --> 12:30.500
AND... SEND.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.582
STOP ME FROM WHAT?

12:32.582 --> 12:35.335
I WAS NEVER REALLY
GONNA REVEAL STAN'S SECRET.

12:35.335 --> 12:37.377
I'VE SEEN HOW MUCH
HE MEANS TO YOU ALL.

12:37.377 --> 12:39.759
STAN, AS BAD AS IT WAS
THAT I SAID YOU WERE
JUST A DOG,

12:39.759 --> 12:42.262
IT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU SHOULD JUST RUN AWAY.

12:42.262 --> 12:45.185
BUT I THOUGHT WE
WEREN'T FRIENDS ANYMORE.
WE NEVER FOUGHT LIKE THAT.

12:45.185 --> 12:46.726
OF COURSE WE'RE STILL FRIENDS.

12:46.726 --> 12:48.768
YOU'RE THE FIRST REAL
FRIEND I'VE EVER HAD.

12:51.691 --> 12:54.734
I'LL ALWAYS BE YOUR FRIEND,
NO MATTER WHAT.

12:54.734 --> 12:56.486
I'LL ALWAYS BE
YOUR FRIEND, TOO.

13:03.203 --> 13:05.245
IF YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
STAN MEANS TO US,

13:05.245 --> 13:07.207
AND YOU WEREN'T GONNA
REVEAL THE SECRET,

13:07.207 --> 13:08.288
WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST SAY THAT?

13:08.288 --> 13:10.871
BECAUSE IT WOULD
DESTROY OUR RIVALRY.

13:10.871 --> 13:13.213
I CHERISH BEING
WORST FRIENDS WITH YOU ALL.

13:13.213 --> 13:16.006
OR WORSTIES,
AS I LIKE TO CALL IT.

13:16.006 --> 13:18.218
THINK OF ALL THE GOOD
BAD TIMES WE'VE HAD.

13:19.379 --> 13:21.591
♪ WHEN I LOOK AT YOU,
I DON'T THINK YOU SEE ♪

13:21.591 --> 13:26.226
♪ JUST HOW MUCH
YOU MEAN TO ME ♪

13:26.226 --> 13:30.230
♪ WHEN I THINK OF YOU,
I'M NOT SURE YOU KNOW ♪

13:30.230 --> 13:34.194
♪ JUST HOW MUCH
I LIKE YOU SO ♪

13:34.194 --> 13:39.569
♪ JUST HOW MUCH I LIKE
YOU SO ♪

13:41.071 --> 13:43.203
OKAY.

13:43.203 --> 13:45.866
IS THAT WHY YOU KEPT
SPYING, EVEN AFTER

13:45.866 --> 13:48.658
YOU COLLECTED
ALL OF YOUR EVIDENCE
TO BE CLOSE TO US?

13:48.658 --> 13:51.661
THAT, AND I ENJOY THE SNUGNESS
OF CLOSE SPACES.

13:51.661 --> 13:53.833
IT'S LIKE A LITTLE HUG.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.086
THE POINT IS, MOTHER WILL
LOOK AT THE RECORDINGS

13:56.086 --> 13:58.008
ON MY COMPUTER AND TELL
EVERYONE ABOUT STAN.

13:58.008 --> 13:59.799
SHE LOVES ATTENTION.

13:59.799 --> 14:01.631
WHY ELSE WOULD SHE BE
A BODY-BUILDING STRONG WOMAN?

14:01.631 --> 14:03.763
STOPPING CANNONBALLS
WITH YOUR STOMACH

14:03.763 --> 14:05.425
HASN'T HAD A REAL-LIFE
APPLICATION

14:05.425 --> 14:07.137
SINCE THE BATTLE
OF ANTIETAM.

14:07.137 --> 14:08.518
THAT'S TRUE.

14:08.518 --> 14:10.270
I THINK... I GUESS.
I DON'T CARE.

14:10.270 --> 14:13.603
YOU HAVE TO DELETE
THE RECORDINGS BEFORE
YOUR MOM SEES THEM.

14:13.603 --> 14:15.235
THAT MAY SOLVE
YOUR PROBLEM,
BUT NOT MINE.

14:15.235 --> 14:17.277
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN MOTHER
SEES THOSE PICTURES

14:17.277 --> 14:20.280
OF ME IN THE VENTS
SPYING AND CHILLAXING?

14:20.280 --> 14:23.323
THOSE RECORDINGS OF STAN
ARE THE ONLY ASSURANCE I HAVE

14:23.323 --> 14:25.655
THAT YOU'LL HELP ME
GET THAT TEXT MESSAGE
OFF HER PHONE.

14:25.655 --> 14:28.118
FINE. WE'LL HELP YOU
DELETE THE MESSAGE.

14:28.118 --> 14:30.370
EXCELLENT. WE HAVE
A SMALL WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.953
MOTHER'S COMPETING AT
A STRONG WOMEN'S
COMPETITION IN THE PARK.

14:32.953 --> 14:34.544
SHE WON'T LOOK AT
HER PHONE UNTIL IT'S DONE.

14:34.544 --> 14:36.796
WAIT. BACK UP A SECOND.

14:36.796 --> 14:38.999
YOU HAVE A BEAR COSTUME?

14:38.999 --> 14:41.341
THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

14:41.341 --> 14:43.093
MAYBE NOT TO YOU.

14:43.093 --> 14:45.595
WHO WANTS GRILLED CHEESE?

14:46.596 --> 14:48.268
I DO, I DO!

14:56.106 --> 14:59.439
SO I REWROTE
YOUR WHOLE BOOK.

14:59.439 --> 15:02.322
I WAS ABLE TO REPURPOSE
SEVERAL CHAPTERS OF MY JOURNAL

15:02.322 --> 15:03.944
AND FILL IT OUT
WITH PICTURES

15:03.944 --> 15:05.445
FROM OUR TRIP TO OJAI.

15:05.445 --> 15:07.197
REMEMBER THOSE TOMATOES?

15:07.197 --> 15:09.329
I ATE THEM LIKE
THEY WERE APPLES.

15:09.329 --> 15:12.412
ELLEN, YOU CAN'T JUST WRITE
MY BOOK.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.374
DON'T WORRY, I'LL LET YOU
KEEP YOUR NAME ON IT.

15:14.374 --> 15:17.037
I DON'T WANT
A LEGAL BATTLE.

15:17.037 --> 15:19.339
BESIDES, I'M NOT
WRITING IT, I'M FIXING IT,

15:19.339 --> 15:21.421
LIKE I FIX EVERYTHING
AROUND HERE.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.303
LIKE THAT TIME...

15:23.303 --> 15:25.425
CHLOE, I'D LOVE
TO JUMP IN, BUT DADDY'S AFRAID.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.307
HONEY, COULD YOU PUSH ME?

15:27.307 --> 15:28.388
I'M ALL READY.

15:28.388 --> 15:30.220
BUBBLES!

15:33.223 --> 15:36.186
I SEE YOU'RE ENJOYING
MY DELICIOUS SANDWICH.

15:36.186 --> 15:39.019
YOU'RE AN AMAZING COOK.

15:39.019 --> 15:41.561
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

15:41.561 --> 15:43.653
OH, I LOVE IT.

15:43.653 --> 15:45.405
I KNOW. MMM, YUMMY.

15:45.405 --> 15:48.368
MOMMY, YOU'RE
A FANTASTIC COOK.

15:48.368 --> 15:51.411
MMM. SCRUMPTIOUS.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.575
OKAY, I'M GONNA ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS.

15:55.575 --> 15:58.958
WHAT IS YOUR NAME,
WHAT YEAR IS IT,
WHO'S THE PRESIDENT?

15:58.958 --> 16:02.382
JUST TRYING TO DETERMINE
WHAT KIND OF DAMAGE
I'M DEALING WITH.

16:02.382 --> 16:05.505
VERY FUNNY, BENNETT.
BUT THAT'S HOW THINGS
ARE AROUND HERE.

16:05.505 --> 16:09.049
NO, I AM THE ONE
WHO MAKES THINGS
WORK IN THIS FAMILY.

16:09.049 --> 16:11.181
REMAIN CALM, SON.

16:11.181 --> 16:12.722
I WILL GET US OUT OF
THIS PREDICAMENT

16:12.722 --> 16:16.356
WITH MY TYPICAL APLOMB
AND INGENUITY.

16:22.062 --> 16:24.944
WOW, DAD,
YOU WERE RIGHT.

16:24.944 --> 16:27.447
YOU ARE MY HERO.

16:27.447 --> 16:30.950
AND YOU COULDN'T HAVE
CHOSEN A FINER HERO.

16:30.950 --> 16:32.452
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

16:32.452 --> 16:34.284
I'M GONNA GO
AND NOT THROW UP.

16:36.166 --> 16:37.957
LET'S SEE IF I CAN
MAKE MYSELF TRIP

16:37.957 --> 16:40.210
OVER THIS FENCE.
WHEE!

16:42.382 --> 16:44.624
YES. GOOD JOB, BENNETT.

16:44.624 --> 16:46.176
YOU'VE TWISTED
ALL THESE THINGS

16:46.176 --> 16:47.717
TO MAKE YOURSELF
SEEM GREAT.

16:47.717 --> 16:49.299
IF I'M NOT GREAT,
WHY DID YOU GIVE ME

16:49.299 --> 16:51.391
THAT FATHER'S DAY CARD
THAT SAID I WAS?

16:51.391 --> 16:52.762
BECAUSE THEY DON'T
MAKE ONE THAT SAYS,

16:52.762 --> 16:54.474
"YOUR WIFE HOLDS
THIS WHOLE THING TOGETHER

16:54.474 --> 16:56.686
"AND YOU'RE LUCKY
TO HAVE HER, BUCK-O.

16:56.686 --> 16:57.897
LOVE, ELLEN."

17:00.900 --> 17:04.194
MOTHER'S PHONE IS
PROBABLY IN HER BAG
IN THE WARM-UP TENT.

17:04.194 --> 17:06.236
OH, GOOD, SHE'S ONSTAGE
RIGHT NOW,

17:06.236 --> 17:08.948
SO WE CAN SLIP IN AND GET IT
BEFORE SHE FINDS OUT.

17:08.948 --> 17:11.321
WHOA, YOUR MOM'S LIFTING
A CAR.

17:11.321 --> 17:13.363
IS THAT PART OF
THE COMPETITION?

17:13.363 --> 17:15.995
NO, SHE PROBABLY CARRIED IT
ONSTAGE BECAUSE SOMEONE

17:15.995 --> 17:18.118
PARKED IN HER SPACE AGAIN.

17:18.118 --> 17:22.712
OH, LET THE PEOPLE
OUT FIRST NEXT TIME, MOTHER.

17:22.712 --> 17:25.004
LOOKS LIKE THAT BIG WOMAN'S
GUARDING THE ENTRANCE
TO THE TENT.

17:25.004 --> 17:26.926
HOW ARE WE GONNA GET IN?

17:26.926 --> 17:29.509
IF ONLY I HAD A COUPLE MORE
HUNDRED POUNDS OF MUSCLE,

17:29.509 --> 17:31.631
I COULD CONVINCE THEM
I WAS A CONTESTANT.

17:31.631 --> 17:33.633
I'M ALREADY PRETTY CUT.

17:33.633 --> 17:35.595
TRICEP.

17:35.595 --> 17:38.638
( Russian accent )
I WILL PRETEND TO BE
TATIA, THE TRAINER.

17:38.638 --> 17:41.311
SQUAT, THRUST,
SQUAT, THRUST.

17:41.311 --> 17:43.233
SQUAT, THRUST.

17:43.233 --> 17:46.276
THERE'S NO TIME FOR THAT.
THERE'S FOUR OF US.

17:46.276 --> 17:49.609
SHE WON'T BE ABLE TO STOP US
IF WE ALL RUSH AT ONCE.
THREE, TWO, ONE.

17:51.241 --> 17:53.403
WERE YOU WAITING
FOR ME TO SAY "GO"?

17:53.403 --> 17:57.327
- COME ON!
- OH, NOW THEY GO.

18:00.410 --> 18:02.332
I GOT IT!

18:13.633 --> 18:15.925
HONEY.

18:15.925 --> 18:17.847
I'VE BEEN THINKING,

18:17.847 --> 18:19.679
AND I'M SORRY FOR
TAKING OVER YOUR BOOK.

18:19.679 --> 18:21.431
I KNOW IT'S WHAT YOU DO.

18:21.431 --> 18:23.563
AND I'M SORRY FOR SAYING
YOU WERE ACTING LIKE

18:23.563 --> 18:25.185
SUCH A MEDDLESOME
BUSYBODY,

18:25.185 --> 18:26.776
STICKING YOUR NOSE
IN MY BUSINESS.

18:26.776 --> 18:28.188
YOU NEVER SAID THAT.

18:28.188 --> 18:29.859
NOT WHILE YOU WERE THERE.

18:29.859 --> 18:32.031
BECAUSE THEY DON'T
MAKE ONE THAT SAYS,

18:32.031 --> 18:33.863
"YOUR WIFE HOLDS
THIS WHOLE THING TOGETHER,

18:33.863 --> 18:36.406
AND YOU'RE LUCKY
TO HAVE HER, BUCK-O.
LOVE, ELLEN."

18:37.827 --> 18:41.241
MAN, SHE IS ACTING LIKE
SUCH A MEDDLESOME BUSYBODY

18:41.241 --> 18:43.243
STICKING HER NOSE
IN MY BUSINESS.

18:45.044 --> 18:47.917
STILL, I FEEL BADLY FOR
WHAT I SAID ABOUT YOUR BOOK.

18:47.917 --> 18:51.341
AND I'M SORRY ABOUT
DISCOUNTING YOUR CONTRIBUTION.

18:51.341 --> 18:53.923
THE IMPORTANT THING
IS THAT WE ALWAYS END UP

18:53.923 --> 18:56.216
COMPLETELY IN SYNC.

18:56.216 --> 18:59.389
I AM SO GLAD SHE IS NOT
GONNA GET INVOLVED
WITH THIS BOOK.

18:59.389 --> 19:04.184
I'M SO EXCITED I'M GONNA BE
WRITING THIS BOOK WITH HIM.

19:06.105 --> 19:08.978
AH, ROBERT AND I HAD
THE MOST RELAXING TIME

19:08.978 --> 19:10.690
AT THE DOGGIE DAY SPA.

19:10.690 --> 19:12.322
YEP, NOTHING IN THE WORLD

19:12.322 --> 19:14.694
CAN POSSIBLY STRESS ME OUT
RIGHT NOW.

19:14.694 --> 19:16.115
KARL KNOWS YOU CAN TALK.

19:16.115 --> 19:17.487
WHAT?!

19:18.658 --> 19:20.200
HELLO, STAN.

19:20.200 --> 19:23.283
EVERYONE BACK UP.
ROBERT NEEDS SOME AIR.

19:24.744 --> 19:26.546
IT'S OKAY, STAN.

19:26.546 --> 19:28.378
WE GOT THE PHONE
AND WE DELETED THE TEXT

19:28.378 --> 19:30.500
- BEFORE ANYTHING
BAD HAPPENED.
- WHAT?

19:30.500 --> 19:32.292
CHLOE, HE DOESN'T KNOW
ANY OF THAT,

19:32.292 --> 19:33.753
AND WE PROBABLY
SHOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING

19:33.753 --> 19:36.966
GIVEN ROBERT'S CONDITION.

19:36.966 --> 19:39.389
TYLER, YOU DO KNOW THAT
ROBERT'S NOT...

19:39.389 --> 19:41.100
NEVER MIND.

19:42.262 --> 19:44.934
SO IS MY SECRET
SAFE WITH YOU?

19:44.934 --> 19:46.306
FOR A PRICE.

19:46.306 --> 19:48.438
I MUST KNOW WHERE
YOU GET YOUR COSTUMES.

20:06.666 --> 20:08.708
THAT'S ONE SECRET
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.290
TOOTS.

20:11.671 --> 20:14.504
All:
OH, STAN!

20:16.215 --> 20:19.259
CHLOE, GET US OUT OF HERE.

20:19.259 --> 20:24.934
GOOD CALL, MRS. GRIMMONS.

20:24.934 --> 20:27.347
WELL, THE KIDS AND MY
RELATIONSHIP WITH KARL

20:27.347 --> 20:29.479
WILL NEVER BE THE SAME
NOW THAT HE KNOWS.

20:29.479 --> 20:31.060
WE'LL ALL HAVE TO BE
VERY CAREFUL

20:31.060 --> 20:32.692
HOW WE DEAL WITH HIM.

20:32.692 --> 20:36.115
OF COURSE, THERE ARE
SOME THINGS NONE OF THEM KNOW,

20:36.115 --> 20:37.777
'CAUSE THEY'RE ONLY
IN MY MIND,

20:37.777 --> 20:39.238
AND ON MY BLOG.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.951
HI, I'M STAN,
STAR OF FREAKY FIDO.

20:41.951 --> 20:43.453
I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT A CAUSE

20:43.453 --> 20:45.325
THAT'S DEAR TO MY HEART--

20:45.325 --> 20:47.707
FREE-RANGE
BACON-WRAPPED CATS.

20:50.079 --> 20:51.581
( normal voice )
STAN.

20:51.581 --> 20:53.293
( forcefully )
STAN.

20:53.293 --> 20:55.335
( sexy )
STAN.

20:55.335 --> 20:57.877
WAIT, WHAT AM I
SELLING HERE?

20:57.877 --> 21:00.179
OH, RIGHT. KIBBLE.

21:00.179 --> 21:02.302
I MEAN,
( sexy ) KIBBLE.

21:29.409 --> 21:31.961
THERE'S THE SUGAR!
