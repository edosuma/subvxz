WEBVTT

00:05.901 --> 00:08.302
And welcome back
to the first annual

00:08.304 --> 00:09.570
Lewis, Roberts & Roberts

00:09.572 --> 00:11.539
Satan's Tongue Spicy
BBQ Sauce-Off.

00:11.541 --> 00:13.908
They'll now be attempting

00:13.910 --> 00:15.810
the four-alarm
ghost pepper blend.

00:15.812 --> 00:18.012
God help them.
God help us all.

00:18.014 --> 00:19.413
Murmur, murmur, murmur.

00:21.483 --> 00:24.218
(groaning) (groaning loudly)

00:24.220 --> 00:27.054
ANDREW:
Waiting for reactions, folks.

00:27.056 --> 00:29.123
Ooh, that was a hot
and spicy blend,

00:29.125 --> 00:31.525
and down goes Zachary!

00:31.527 --> 00:32.493
Whoa.
Attention, everyone!

00:32.494 --> 00:34.228
This is my new
assistant, Allie.

00:34.230 --> 00:35.896
ANDREW: surprised
he made it this far.

00:35.898 --> 00:38.366
- Let's clear him out. - You'll
have to excuse everyone.

00:38.368 --> 00:40.334
It's a really big
day around here.

00:40.336 --> 00:41.902
My dad loves this
barbeque sauce,

00:41.904 --> 00:43.170
and he's dying for the account.

00:43.172 --> 00:45.739
Or after this next shot,
he might just be dying.

00:45.741 --> 00:47.107
Oh, I know about
the competition.

00:47.109 --> 00:49.043
Yeah, I had Lauren send me
your schedule.

00:49.045 --> 00:51.278
So, I've taken the liberty
of placing Tums and Shout Wipes

00:51.280 --> 00:52.580
on everyone's desks.

00:52.582 --> 00:54.014
I love you.

00:54.016 --> 00:55.349
I'm sorry, I mean, thank you.

00:55.351 --> 00:56.350
I love you. Um...

00:56.352 --> 00:57.551
(clears throat) Uh, coffee...

00:57.553 --> 00:58.552
Yes, tepid with a splash

00:58.554 --> 00:59.853
of almond milk.
I've been blowing

00:59.855 --> 01:01.655
on it every 40 seconds
to cool it down.

01:01.657 --> 01:02.823
Oh, thank you.

01:02.825 --> 01:04.090
- Uh, it's not ready.
- ZACH: Oh, God.

01:04.093 --> 01:05.125
I've never felt so...

01:05.126 --> 01:07.094
Hello.

01:07.096 --> 01:09.029
I'm Zachary, and you are?

01:09.031 --> 01:10.064
Not interested.

01:10.066 --> 01:12.032
- What? - Okay, you listen
to me, boy toy,

01:12.034 --> 01:13.200
and you listen
very carefully, okay,

01:13.202 --> 01:14.468
'cause I'm only gonna
say this once.

01:14.470 --> 01:15.903
I finally got my own assistant,

01:15.905 --> 01:17.037
and you are not gonna
screw this up.

01:17.039 --> 01:18.505
You will not happen
to be having lunch

01:18.507 --> 01:20.307
at the same place that she is,
you won't just happen

01:20.309 --> 01:21.809
to be grabbing a
drink at the same bar,

01:21.811 --> 01:23.277
and you will not just happen
to have condoms

01:23.279 --> 01:25.612
when she's bored and hanging out
at your apartment.

01:25.614 --> 01:27.114
I was just gonna say hello.

01:27.116 --> 01:28.415
I'll say it for you.

01:28.417 --> 01:29.983
You stay away from my machine.

01:29.985 --> 01:32.119
Back away.

01:32.121 --> 01:33.787
Okay.

01:33.789 --> 01:35.689
(ululating) (yells)

01:35.691 --> 01:37.624
ANDREW:
And go for it!

01:37.626 --> 01:39.993
(groaning) (groans, yells)

01:39.995 --> 01:41.361
Shake it off, shake it off.

01:41.363 --> 01:42.829
Here we go. And go for it!

01:42.831 --> 01:45.365
(groans)

01:50.071 --> 01:52.339
I conthede. I conthede.

01:52.341 --> 01:54.040
I-I can't feel my tongue.

01:54.042 --> 01:56.009
(yells)

01:56.011 --> 01:57.744
We have a champion.

01:57.746 --> 01:59.946
Oh, I love this sauce!

01:59.948 --> 02:01.414
Now on to the pitch!

02:01.416 --> 02:04.150
Let's make Satan's Tongue
Spicy Barbeque Sauce...

02:04.152 --> 02:05.852
(cheering) ours!

02:05.854 --> 02:07.320
Yeah...!

02:07.322 --> 02:09.955
♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪

02:09.958 --> 02:12.826

02:12.828 --> 02:15.729

02:23.872 --> 02:25.872
So, when our aunt died,

02:25.874 --> 02:27.974
all she had left
was her collection

02:27.976 --> 02:30.076
of frogs in sex poses

02:30.078 --> 02:32.278
and a shoebox full of recipes.

02:32.280 --> 02:33.513
Amazing. So in the sweet,

02:33.515 --> 02:34.747
sexually amphibious
woman's shoebox,

02:34.749 --> 02:37.483
you found a magic sauce
that will make people say,

02:37.485 --> 02:39.319
“Ketchup? What the
hell is that”"

02:39.321 --> 02:40.853
(chuckles) He's a huge fan.

02:40.855 --> 02:41.788
Yeah.

02:41.790 --> 02:43.623
I even had this made
so I can take

02:43.625 --> 02:45.024
a bottle to the movies
and sushi bars.

02:45.026 --> 02:46.459
ZACH:
He never goes anywhere

02:46.461 --> 02:47.627
without his sauce jockey.

02:47.629 --> 02:49.028
I'm on a TSA watch list.

02:49.030 --> 02:50.730
Ladies, what is it
you're looking for?

02:50.732 --> 02:52.465
What's your wish list?

02:52.467 --> 02:54.167
Well, what we'd really love

02:54.169 --> 02:56.669
is one of those fun jingles

02:56.671 --> 02:58.304
that sticks in your head.

02:58.306 --> 03:00.440
Oh, like the one for petit
peas; I love that one.

03:00.442 --> 03:01.607
Yeah, that's Danny Chase.

03:01.609 --> 03:03.109
Best jingle writer
in the business.

03:03.111 --> 03:04.177
Could we get him?
Get him?

03:04.179 --> 03:05.711
We created him;
he'll do anything for us.

03:05.713 --> 03:07.513
If you sign
with Lewis, Roberts & Roberts,

03:07.515 --> 03:08.481
he'll do anything for y...

03:08.483 --> 03:09.615
(stomach grumbling) (groaning)

03:09.617 --> 03:10.683
(strained):
Ladies, boys.

03:10.685 --> 03:12.752
What? (wheezing):
Can I have a word?

03:12.754 --> 03:14.587
(wheezing continues)

03:14.589 --> 03:15.788
Hey, boss,

03:15.790 --> 03:16.989
you okay?

03:16.991 --> 03:18.324
Maybe. I'm either having
a heart attack

03:18.326 --> 03:19.659
or my stomach's melting
from that sauce.

03:19.661 --> 03:21.193
Fingers crossed it's number two.
God, does this hurt.

03:21.195 --> 03:22.528
L-Let me drive you
to the hospital.

03:22.530 --> 03:24.330
No, you care too much
about the safety of pedestrians.

03:24.332 --> 03:26.232
- Andrew? You stay here.
- On it.

03:26.234 --> 03:28.334
- Keep them on the hook.
- You-you want me to finish

03:28.336 --> 03:29.935
- this meeting by myself?
- Of course.

03:29.937 --> 03:31.971
You do not let these women leave
the room without closing

03:31.973 --> 03:33.105
this account, okay?

03:33.107 --> 03:34.473
I'm gonna do it for you, boss.

03:34.475 --> 03:35.908
I'm gonna give you
Satan's Tongue.

03:35.910 --> 03:37.409
Fantastic. Ladies?

03:37.411 --> 03:38.110
Mm-hmm?

03:38.112 --> 03:39.278
I've had two dreams.

03:39.280 --> 03:41.146
One was to ride an ostrich
down Michigan Avenue,

03:41.148 --> 03:42.548
the other was to meet you.

03:42.550 --> 03:43.749
I'm thrilled to say

03:43.751 --> 03:45.117
(stomach grumbling)
I've realized both.

03:45.119 --> 03:46.852
I leave you in good hands.

03:46.854 --> 03:48.754
(chuckles)

03:48.756 --> 03:51.857
Millie, Jane, what can we do

03:51.859 --> 03:53.492
to get you to sign
with our agency?

03:53.494 --> 03:55.127
Well, the campaign you've
pitched is amazing.

03:55.129 --> 03:58.630
But you should know that we are
meeting with other agencies.

03:58.632 --> 04:00.399
Yeah, but are any
of these other agencies

04:00.401 --> 04:03.669
gonna be able to get you
a jingle written by Danny Chase?

04:03.671 --> 04:04.970
(gasps) That would be so fun.

04:04.972 --> 04:06.505
Who would you get to sing it?

04:06.507 --> 04:08.273
Anyone you want.

04:08.275 --> 04:09.842
But we're just a tiny company.

04:09.844 --> 04:12.478
I doubt you'd be able
to get anybody really big.

04:12.480 --> 04:13.979
Think big, ladies. Big!

04:13.981 --> 04:15.280
Brad Paisley.

04:15.282 --> 04:17.249
(chuckles) He's really big.

04:17.250 --> 04:19.750
We'd sign with you right now
if you could get him.

04:21.988 --> 04:23.255
You got him!

04:23.257 --> 04:24.489
(squeals)

04:24.491 --> 04:25.891
(laughter)

04:25.893 --> 04:27.459
(chuckles)

04:27.461 --> 04:28.694
You promised them Brad Paisley?

04:28.696 --> 04:29.928
They're a tiny regional brand.

04:29.930 --> 04:31.129
You guaranteed them a huge star.

04:31.131 --> 04:32.798
(stomach grumbling)
You over-promised.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.399
Isn't that a classic
Simon Roberts move?

04:34.401 --> 04:36.501
But the over-promise
is just one of my many moves.

04:36.503 --> 04:39.204
This situation cried out
for a nod and switch.

04:39.206 --> 04:41.406
What is a nod and switch? I taught
you that on day one, remember?

04:41.408 --> 04:43.241
You asked for a parking space.

04:43.243 --> 04:44.810
I nodded and suggested
a bus pass,

04:44.812 --> 04:47.112
- because hotties take the bus.
- There were no hotties on the bus.

04:47.114 --> 04:49.181
Of course not. I tricked you
with a nod and switch.

04:49.183 --> 04:50.715
(groans) I validated your idea

04:50.717 --> 04:52.584
then substituted one
that would benefit me.

04:52.586 --> 04:53.685
I thought that
was called a pivot.

04:53.687 --> 04:54.886
No! Doc,

04:54.888 --> 04:56.221
I think I'm having
another heart attack.

04:56.223 --> 04:57.522
It wasn't a heart attack,

04:57.524 --> 04:59.257
but your blood vinegar levels
are through the roof.

04:59.259 --> 05:01.192
I think you've been hitting
the sauce a little too hard.

05:01.194 --> 05:03.161
But BBQ sauce is
the only sauce I can hit.

05:03.163 --> 05:05.063
How am I gonna handle the
problems you created without it?

05:05.065 --> 05:06.898
I'm gonna give you
and your husband some privacy.

05:06.900 --> 05:08.166
Oh, no, we're not...
Thank you, Doctor.

05:08.168 --> 05:09.300
Look, you scare me

05:09.302 --> 05:11.269
when you make
that-that squishy angry face.

05:11.271 --> 05:13.138
- Stop it, stop it.
- Okay.

05:13.140 --> 05:15.073
Stop it.
Are there any moves left?

05:15.075 --> 05:17.208
Only the most hated move of all,
doing what we promised.

05:17.210 --> 05:19.144
Now let's go clean up your mess

05:19.146 --> 05:21.112
and get Danny Chase
and Brad Paisley.

05:21.114 --> 05:22.780
You can see my butt, right?

05:22.782 --> 05:24.115
Full moon.

05:24.117 --> 05:26.251
Oh. (howls)

05:32.597 --> 05:34.464
Hey, Lauren,
have you seen Allie?

05:34.466 --> 05:36.099
Oh, yeah, she's just making me
some oatmeal.

05:36.101 --> 05:37.301
Actually, remaking it.

05:37.303 --> 05:39.002
She went a little crazy
with the almonds.

05:39.004 --> 05:40.671
- Lauren...
- You know, I always hated

05:40.673 --> 05:42.639
when you made me redo
stuff, but now I get it.

05:42.641 --> 05:44.274
It's a real power trip.

05:44.276 --> 05:46.276
Lauren, you know she's not
your assistant, right?

05:46.278 --> 05:47.844
I know that and you know that,

05:47.846 --> 05:49.379
but she doesn't
have to know that.

05:49.381 --> 05:50.447
Here you go. Sorry.

05:50.449 --> 05:51.682
Won't happen again, Lauren.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.617
It's totally fine, but
see that it doesn't.

05:53.619 --> 05:55.952
(whispering):
What a rush.

05:55.954 --> 05:57.821
I'm sorry, I think my head
is just in the clouds.

05:57.823 --> 05:58.955
I'm excited.

05:58.957 --> 06:00.190
I met someone this morning.

06:00.192 --> 06:02.425
Really? This morning?

06:02.427 --> 06:04.995
On your way into work,
she asked, fearing the worst.

06:04.997 --> 06:06.496
Oh, no, no, no, he works here,

06:06.498 --> 06:07.764
and he's so hot.

06:07.766 --> 06:09.299
We're going out tonight.
(squeaks)

06:09.301 --> 06:11.501
Oh! That's so great.

06:11.503 --> 06:12.903
Look, your problem is
you're just not used

06:12.905 --> 06:14.170
to people being angry at you.

06:14.172 --> 06:15.572
Yeah, but this is Simon.

06:15.574 --> 06:17.841
Andrew, this is like
God saying to Jesus

06:17.843 --> 06:20.210
you should've turned the
water into better wine.

06:20.212 --> 06:21.845
And in this analogy,
you're Jesus?

06:21.847 --> 06:23.313
Yeah, I just hope
the story ends...

06:23.315 --> 06:25.915
I'm sorry, Zach, not everything
in this office is yours.

06:25.917 --> 06:27.484
I brought that muffin from home.

06:27.486 --> 06:29.085
There are a million women
out there, okay?

06:29.087 --> 06:30.186
And yes,
I realize you've probably

06:30.188 --> 06:31.321
Zached your way
through most of them,

06:31.323 --> 06:32.388
but couldn't you just

06:32.390 --> 06:33.456
honor my one tiny request

06:33.458 --> 06:34.724
and not go out
with my assistant?

06:34.726 --> 06:36.826
I'm not going out Allie.
I am.

06:36.828 --> 06:39.095
It was a zucchini banana nut
from the corner store

06:39.097 --> 06:40.597
on Halstead, if you want
to make things right.

06:40.599 --> 06:41.798
I don't understand.

06:41.800 --> 06:44.200
Why? Is it so surprising
that a desirable,

06:44.202 --> 06:46.102
attractive woman
would want to go out with me?

06:46.104 --> 06:48.304
Yeah.
No. No. No, I just...

06:48.306 --> 06:51.074
needed a little time to process
'cause I thought, you know...

06:51.076 --> 06:52.709
Of course you could have
any woman that you want.

06:52.711 --> 06:54.777
It just... Oh, my God, Sydney,
It was Andrew, not Zach!

06:54.779 --> 06:55.878
Isn't that insane?

06:55.880 --> 06:57.113
Yeah, we've already
established that,

06:57.115 --> 06:58.147
but thank you, Lauren.

06:58.149 --> 06:59.315
Wait, so Andrew gets

06:59.317 --> 07:00.683
to go out with her?

07:00.685 --> 07:02.752
This is BS. Why am I the
only one that gets banned?

07:02.754 --> 07:03.953
Wait, you banned Zach?

07:03.955 --> 07:05.888
You don't think
I'm even ban-worthy?

07:05.890 --> 07:07.623
Fine, you're banned, too.
You can't do that.

07:07.625 --> 07:09.492
You just asked me to.
I wanted to be banned.

07:09.494 --> 07:10.726
I didn't say I wanted
to adhere to it.

07:10.728 --> 07:12.228
Well, I'm sorry,
you can't date her either.

07:12.230 --> 07:14.096
Yeah, stay away
from our assistant.

07:14.098 --> 07:16.232
Hey, Syd, Allie is a grown-up.
So am I.

07:16.234 --> 07:17.767
We can do whatever
we choose to do.

07:17.769 --> 07:18.768
We're all adults here.

07:18.770 --> 07:20.303
Yeah. Hey, by the way,

07:20.305 --> 07:21.537
if anything happens

07:21.539 --> 07:23.706
and your phone accidentally
takes a couple pictures,

07:23.708 --> 07:26.175
that'd be cool.
Okay, we're mostly adults here.

07:26.177 --> 07:28.277
LAUREN:
<i>Hey, you guys.</i>

07:28.279 --> 07:30.179
Danny Chase is on his way up.
ZACH: It's gonna be easy

07:30.181 --> 07:31.380
to get him to do this, right?

07:31.382 --> 07:32.782
Well, yeah, he works
a lot, but I'm sure

07:32.784 --> 07:33.916
he's still the same sweet kid.

07:33.918 --> 07:35.418
(elevator bell dings)

07:43.927 --> 07:45.261
(laughs)

07:45.263 --> 07:46.362
What up, bitches?

07:46.364 --> 07:48.164
Did somebody call
a master jingle-ist?

07:48.166 --> 07:50.933
Because D.C. is in the
hizz-ouse.

07:50.935 --> 07:52.801
(chuckling)

07:52.803 --> 07:55.084
Hey.
Hi. Oh!

07:56.006 --> 07:57.673
Oh!

07:57.675 --> 07:59.308
That could've been you, Sydney!

07:59.310 --> 08:00.709
50 yards, jingle boy.

08:00.711 --> 08:02.044
In effect till 2015.

08:02.046 --> 08:03.245
You're adorable.

08:03.247 --> 08:05.180
So why me?

08:05.182 --> 08:06.482
Why barbeque sauce?

08:07.350 --> 08:08.951
Why now?

08:08.953 --> 08:10.486
You're great; it's great.
You are.

08:10.488 --> 08:12.521
It's a time that worked
for all of our schedules.

08:12.523 --> 08:14.289
Look, you guys gave me
my first shot,

08:14.291 --> 08:16.758
so I felt I owed it to you
to at least take the meeting,

08:16.760 --> 08:18.127
but I thought my agent
would've told you,

08:18.129 --> 08:19.561
I don't do condiments.

08:19.563 --> 08:21.663
Your mom was lovely, but she
didn't mention that on the call.

08:21.665 --> 08:23.298
Well, then she is no longer
my agent.

08:23.300 --> 08:24.967
I just fired her.

08:24.969 --> 08:27.669
Wow. L-Look, this is more
than just a condiment.

08:27.671 --> 08:29.104
A condiment is something
that you throw

08:29.106 --> 08:30.806
on a meal at the last minute;
it's an afterthought.

08:30.808 --> 08:32.140
Satan's Tongue is
the main event.

08:32.142 --> 08:33.609
It's more like a
meal replacement.

08:33.611 --> 08:35.210
I had one for breakfast,
one for lunch,

08:35.212 --> 08:36.778
and then a sensible dinner.

08:36.780 --> 08:38.046
You know what,
I'm gonna do something

08:38.048 --> 08:39.280
that I don't normally do.

08:40.116 --> 08:41.717
I'm gonna take off my sunglasses

08:41.719 --> 08:43.784
and I'm gonna really listen.

08:43.787 --> 08:45.687
This sauce of yours,

08:45.689 --> 08:47.589
does it have a story?

08:47.591 --> 08:49.624
It actually does.

08:53.830 --> 08:55.096
(high-pitched squeal)

08:55.098 --> 08:56.231
Begin.

08:56.233 --> 08:58.099
(piano playing) 50 years ago,

08:58.101 --> 08:59.935
there was a strange old woman

08:59.937 --> 09:01.903
with a slightly
complicated sex life.

09:01.905 --> 09:04.205
She found her steak
to be dry and tough

09:04.207 --> 09:05.941
and wanted to find a way
to moisten her meat.

09:05.943 --> 09:10.278
♪ Is your tenderloin
less than tender? ♪

09:10.280 --> 09:12.414
She went to her cupboard
and found molasses,

09:12.416 --> 09:16.217
ghost peppers and seven
secret ingredients.

09:16.219 --> 09:19.421
♪ Seven wonders
of the secret spice world ♪

09:19.423 --> 09:21.089
Shh.

09:21.091 --> 09:22.323
Was that part of the song

09:22.325 --> 09:24.225
or do you want us
to actually be quiet?

09:24.227 --> 09:25.794
♪ It's kind of both because... ♪

09:25.796 --> 09:27.762
You know what? I'm in.

09:27.764 --> 09:28.763
This is officially

09:28.765 --> 09:30.231
a Danny Chase joint.

09:30.233 --> 09:31.599
Yes!
Great.

09:32.607 --> 09:34.168
Guess who's gonna be singing
your words?

09:34.170 --> 09:35.503
Danny don't guess.

09:35.505 --> 09:36.704
We will tell you right now.

09:36.706 --> 09:37.839
We're going after...

09:37.841 --> 09:39.374
BOTH:
Brad Paisley.

09:39.376 --> 09:41.075
(gunshot noises)

09:42.645 --> 09:44.445
- I'm out.
- BOTH: What?

09:44.447 --> 09:46.314
I hate Brad Paisley.

09:46.316 --> 09:47.382
Why? What'd he ever do to you?

09:47.384 --> 09:49.417
Oh, Paisley knows
what he did to me.

09:49.419 --> 09:50.985
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
Danny, Danny, Danny, sit, sit.

09:50.987 --> 09:52.320
There's got to be something
we can do

09:52.322 --> 09:53.721
to change your mind.
Something.

09:53.723 --> 09:55.490
(sighs)

09:55.492 --> 09:57.892
I suppose if Paisley
were to apologize to me,

09:57.894 --> 10:01.062
I might consider stomaching him
for one session.

10:01.064 --> 10:02.730
We haven't even talked to him.
Done!

10:02.732 --> 10:04.765
You will get your apology, sir.

10:04.767 --> 10:06.534
Then you will get
your genius jingle.

10:06.536 --> 10:07.835
This is empty.

10:07.837 --> 10:08.936
Why is this always empty?

10:08.938 --> 10:10.671
What have I got
to do to get some

10:10.673 --> 10:11.973
melon liqueur up in here?

10:11.975 --> 10:13.174
Lauren!
Okay, I'm sorry.

10:13.176 --> 10:14.609
- I'm sorry.
- What?

10:14.611 --> 10:16.110
I over-promised again,
didn't I?

10:16.112 --> 10:17.645
What is wrong with you?!

10:20.797 --> 10:22.717
Oh, my God, I mean,
this is insane.

10:22.719 --> 10:24.853
So, I strictly forbade Andrew

10:24.855 --> 10:26.855
from going out with Allie
last night, and what does he do?

10:26.857 --> 10:28.056
Goes out with Allie.

10:28.058 --> 10:29.157
I mean, this just makes me so...

10:29.159 --> 10:30.926
- Jealous?
- Annoyed.

10:31.727 --> 10:33.895
No, I'm not jealous.

10:33.897 --> 10:36.898
Just upset that someone is
going out with my assistant.

10:36.900 --> 10:38.800
It doesn't make it any worse
that it's Andrew.

10:38.802 --> 10:41.036
Right, Andrew.
Not jealous, got it.

10:41.038 --> 10:43.238
ANDREW:
Okay, break it up, ladies.

10:43.240 --> 10:44.939
Let's just get it
all out on the table.

10:44.941 --> 10:46.374
Allie and I went out last night,

10:46.376 --> 10:47.942
and while she's perfectly nice,

10:47.944 --> 10:49.878
I don't think I'm gonna be
seeing her again.

10:49.880 --> 10:51.413
I just wasn't feeling it,
you know?

10:51.415 --> 10:54.482
So, why pursue something
if it's not going anywhere?

10:54.484 --> 10:56.017
At least,
that's how I put it to her.

10:56.019 --> 10:59.521
Wait, you said that to her?
Yeah, at the end of the date.

10:59.523 --> 11:01.422
Thought I should be honest. LAUREN:
Who's honest, you psychopath?

11:01.424 --> 11:03.658
You don't tell someone you don't
want to see them again.

11:03.660 --> 11:06.227
You lie, you evade,
you make up excuses.

11:06.229 --> 11:07.428
There's dead grandmas

11:07.430 --> 11:08.496
and work projects

11:08.498 --> 11:10.131
and colds
that linger for months.

11:10.133 --> 11:12.033
Lauren's right. I mean, there's
a guy from OkCupid who thinks

11:12.035 --> 11:13.401
I'm in a Mexican
jail right now.

11:13.403 --> 11:15.903
Gerald the security guard thinks
I'm my own twin sister.

11:15.905 --> 11:17.071
You guys are
completely overreacting.

11:17.073 --> 11:19.474
I'm sure she's fine.
(scoffs)

11:19.476 --> 11:20.475
(sobbing)

11:20.477 --> 11:22.310
I-I just...

11:22.312 --> 11:24.712
I thought he really liked me.

11:26.215 --> 11:28.116
I can't... I can't work today.

11:28.118 --> 11:31.252
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

11:31.254 --> 11:32.753
Look, we have no idea what went
down between Danny Chase

11:32.755 --> 11:34.322
and Brad Paisley,
but the one thing I do know

11:34.324 --> 11:36.958
is stars like Paisley
are notoriously difficult.

11:37.759 --> 11:39.293
You the barbeque sauce dudes?

11:39.295 --> 11:40.962
Yes, sir.
Oh, I'm totally in.

11:40.964 --> 11:42.196
Look,
I know it's just regional,

11:42.198 --> 11:43.798
but Big Paisley's got
to get that sauce money.

11:43.800 --> 11:46.133
Wow.
Where do I sign?

11:46.135 --> 11:49.503
Yeah, see, when I care

11:49.505 --> 11:50.938
about a product or a cause,

11:50.940 --> 11:52.173
I'm happy to lend my name to it.

11:52.175 --> 11:53.975
That's the way
my mama taught me.

11:53.977 --> 11:55.076
Bless your mama.

11:55.078 --> 11:56.510
Here you go, Brad.
Thanks.

11:56.512 --> 11:58.846
Hi, I'm Brad Paisley,
and you've reached

11:58.848 --> 12:00.114
Amy's voice mail.

12:00.116 --> 12:04.285
♪ Leave a message at the tone. ♪

12:04.287 --> 12:05.319
Good one.

12:05.321 --> 12:07.922
Boom, just made 35 bucks.

12:07.924 --> 12:09.223
Oh.
Wow.

12:09.225 --> 12:10.491
Brad... May I call you Brad?

12:10.493 --> 12:12.293
Yeah.

12:12.295 --> 12:13.661
Satan's Tongue is
a wonderful product,

12:13.663 --> 12:15.462
and this commercial's
gonna be the balls.

12:15.464 --> 12:18.065
But there's just
one tiny, tiny hitch.

12:18.067 --> 12:19.500
It's silly to even
mention it, really.

12:19.502 --> 12:20.634
What?
Well, just so you know,

12:20.636 --> 12:23.537
the jingle writer for
this campaign is...

12:23.539 --> 12:25.973
Danny Chase.

12:26.775 --> 12:28.042
Who?

12:28.910 --> 12:30.811
Danny Chase.

12:30.813 --> 12:32.746
Never heard of him.
(laughter)

12:32.748 --> 12:34.248
(laughing):
Didn't expect that.

12:34.250 --> 12:35.949
(high-pitched):
I don't know.

12:35.951 --> 12:38.385
Say, Brad,

12:38.387 --> 12:39.753
there's this game
that we like to play.

12:39.755 --> 12:41.889
Yeah, this kind of crazy little
thing we do once in a while.

12:41.891 --> 12:43.157
“What would you do”
is what it's called.

12:43.159 --> 12:44.359
Yeah, “what would
you do if..”"

12:44.360 --> 12:45.959
All right.
Somebody asked you

12:45.961 --> 12:48.829
to apologize to a stranger
you've never met before

12:48.831 --> 12:50.130
for something
you don't remember doing.

12:50.132 --> 12:52.466
All right, look, fellas,
I got two rules.

12:52.468 --> 12:53.800
All right, one:

12:53.802 --> 12:56.703
I don't do a gig without
a life-size bust of my head

12:56.705 --> 12:58.238
made out of cheese.

12:58.240 --> 13:00.173
That's reasonable. Yeah.
Fair enough.

13:00.175 --> 13:02.409
Second: I don't apologize
for nothing.

13:02.411 --> 13:03.577
Should've expected that.

13:03.579 --> 13:04.911
I'm in hell.

13:05.747 --> 13:07.848
Well, Andrew,
you broke my assistant.

13:07.850 --> 13:10.383
So now you're gonna fix her.
Oh, yeah? How?

13:10.385 --> 13:12.185
Go out with her again,
but this time,

13:12.187 --> 13:13.787
instead of turning on the charm,
do the opposite.

13:13.789 --> 13:14.921
Make her hate you.

13:14.923 --> 13:16.223
We give her the victory.

13:16.225 --> 13:19.092
And then boom,
I get my assistant back.

13:19.094 --> 13:21.061
Sorry,
we get my assistant back.

13:21.063 --> 13:22.596
What a fiendishly clever plan.

13:22.598 --> 13:24.497
Um, excuse me,
this is your fault.

13:24.499 --> 13:25.732
So you're gonna be part
of the solution.

13:25.734 --> 13:27.367
All we're asking is for you

13:27.369 --> 13:28.535
to be just
a little less charming.

13:28.537 --> 13:29.636
You think you could do that?

13:29.638 --> 13:31.071
(sighs) Gosh, I don't know.

13:31.073 --> 13:33.606
It's hard to just turn this off.

13:33.608 --> 13:34.708
Are you gonna act like that?

13:34.710 --> 13:36.750
'Cause that will be perfect.
Thank you.

13:39.680 --> 13:43.049
(guitar playing) “Again, I
am sorry for that thing

13:43.051 --> 13:44.951
“that I did in the past.
Mm-hmm.

13:44.953 --> 13:46.686
“I feel so bad about it. Aw. Aw.

13:46.688 --> 13:47.921
“Let's agree to move on

13:47.923 --> 13:50.657
and never speak of that
thing I did again.”

13:50.659 --> 13:52.225
Wow. That's the
best apology letter

13:52.227 --> 13:53.660
Lauren could come up with?

13:53.662 --> 13:55.495
- It's worth it for her
forgery skills. - Ah.

13:55.497 --> 13:59.365
“Sincerely, Brad Paisley.”

13:59.367 --> 14:03.102
It takes a big man to apologize
on lavender-scented stationery.

14:03.104 --> 14:04.270
(sniffs)

14:04.272 --> 14:05.838
I guess I should thank him
for the gesture.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.040
No, no, no, no.
No!

14:07.042 --> 14:08.308
Brad is a Southern gentleman.

14:08.310 --> 14:10.576
It took a lot for him
to even write that apology.

14:10.578 --> 14:13.679
You know, there's an old
Southern saying. Mm-hmm.

14:13.681 --> 14:15.448
About the, um...

14:15.450 --> 14:17.884
Possum who's... um...
(stammering)

14:17.886 --> 14:19.652
He's been slighted.
Yeah.

14:19.654 --> 14:22.221
And he doesn't hiss when
it's been righted. Yeah.

14:22.223 --> 14:23.723
It's not a great
Southern saying.

14:23.725 --> 14:25.391
Just old.
Yeah. The point is

14:25.393 --> 14:28.060
(Southern accent): you should never,
ever talk about this again. Ever.

14:28.062 --> 14:29.161
Never.

14:29.163 --> 14:31.230
Hey, guys,
this jingle's pretty great.

14:31.965 --> 14:34.567
♪ Sweeter than springtime ♪

14:34.569 --> 14:35.935
♪ Hotter than hell ♪

14:35.937 --> 14:38.738
♪ There's a fire in my lungs ♪

14:38.740 --> 14:41.340
♪ Someone call me an ambulance ♪

14:41.342 --> 14:46.479
♪ I just had
some Satan's Tongue. ♪

14:47.314 --> 14:48.714
Brad, you sound amazing.

14:48.716 --> 14:50.649
Let's start recording. Yeah.

14:50.651 --> 14:52.551
We did it, boss.
We got Brad Paisley

14:52.553 --> 14:54.954
to sing a regional commercial.
Wow.

14:54.956 --> 14:56.188
I guess someone's retaining

14:56.190 --> 14:57.756
their employee
of the month title.

14:57.758 --> 14:58.891
Can't say I'm not relieved.

14:58.893 --> 15:00.092
I had 12 plaques preordered.

15:00.094 --> 15:01.527
(door opens) Where's Danny?

15:01.529 --> 15:02.595
BRAD: Hey, man.
Hey.

15:02.597 --> 15:03.829
I just, um...

15:03.831 --> 15:05.331
I just have one question.
ZACH: No!

15:05.333 --> 15:06.966
Remember the possum.
Doesn't hiss.

15:06.968 --> 15:08.033
Um, would you have
apologized to me

15:08.035 --> 15:09.635
if I wasn't one-time
Possum. (hissing)

15:09.637 --> 15:11.804
- Tuney Award winner Danny Chase?
- Possum.

15:11.806 --> 15:13.072
(Zach chuckles)

15:13.074 --> 15:14.239
I didn't apologize to you.

15:14.241 --> 15:16.408
It-It's in this letter.

15:16.410 --> 15:17.676
- Yeah.
- Or is it?

15:17.678 --> 15:18.877
Or why are we here?

15:18.879 --> 15:20.312
These and other fun
questions could be answered

15:20.314 --> 15:21.513
after the session.
In the other room.

15:21.515 --> 15:23.282
- Wait, that's not my signature.
- No?

15:23.284 --> 15:24.917
(sniffs)
But that is my signature scent.

15:24.919 --> 15:26.485
And what a lovely scent it is.

15:26.487 --> 15:28.053
Okay, take one, let's go

15:28.055 --> 15:28.954
to the other room.

15:28.956 --> 15:30.889
- You lied to me.
- Well...

15:30.891 --> 15:32.124
Wait, you told him I wrote this?

15:32.126 --> 15:33.358
What?
(scoffs)

15:33.360 --> 15:34.793
Why the hell would I apologize

15:34.795 --> 15:37.129
to someone
I've never seen before?

15:37.131 --> 15:39.731
- You don't know who I am?
- No.

15:39.733 --> 15:43.502
- You don't have any idea
what you did to me? - No.

15:44.771 --> 15:47.773
DANNY (deep voice): ♪ You've
got to know when to hold 'em ♪

15:47.775 --> 15:50.942
(high-pitched):
♪ And know when to fold 'em. ♪

15:50.944 --> 15:52.144
Okay, I got to stop you
right there.

15:52.146 --> 15:53.445
I'm sorry, but the last time

15:53.447 --> 15:56.014
I heard that sound,
somewhere a bull

15:56.016 --> 15:57.082
became a steer.

15:57.084 --> 15:58.450
You're un-American.

15:58.452 --> 16:01.686
(buzzer blaring)

16:01.688 --> 16:03.054
So this is what
you're angry about?

16:03.056 --> 16:04.656
This is what you've been
putting us through hell for?

16:04.658 --> 16:06.858
Because you were cut
from a reality show

16:06.860 --> 16:08.393
that airs at 2:00
in the morning

16:08.395 --> 16:10.395
after that infomercial for the
thing that shocks your face?

16:10.397 --> 16:12.531
Oh, I remember you now.

16:12.533 --> 16:13.665
You sang like a girl.

16:13.667 --> 16:16.368
Hey, that is called falsetto.

16:16.370 --> 16:17.402
- Okay?
- Oh, I don't know.

16:17.404 --> 16:18.637
You know what really
matters, guys,

16:18.639 --> 16:20.138
is that we're all here
to sing the jingle,

16:20.140 --> 16:21.606
and we're all gonna
make a ton of money.

16:21.608 --> 16:23.041
It's not about the money.

16:23.043 --> 16:24.075
Oh, it's always about the money.

16:24.077 --> 16:25.677
It's about the integrity.

16:25.679 --> 16:27.512
Oh, no, he's throwing
the “I” word around.

16:27.514 --> 16:29.247
You all lied to me,
and now you expect me

16:29.249 --> 16:30.548
to listen to this joker

16:30.550 --> 16:32.717
bastardize my song?
Hey.

16:32.719 --> 16:35.019
(country twang):
♪ Satan's Tongue. ♪

16:35.021 --> 16:37.155
Come on, Danny, be
reasonable, please!

16:37.157 --> 16:38.256
Simon, let me handle this.

16:38.258 --> 16:39.924
I have a lot
of experience dealing

16:39.926 --> 16:42.127
with people
who are emotionally challenged.

16:42.129 --> 16:43.461
(grunting)

16:43.463 --> 16:44.996
Ow, damn!

16:44.998 --> 16:46.758
ZACH:
Can we get some ice?

16:50.075 --> 16:52.115
ZACH: <i>Paisley is on his
way to the airport</i>

16:52.117 --> 16:53.383
in a Super Shuttle.

16:53.385 --> 16:54.585
The client gets here tomorrow,

16:54.586 --> 16:56.520
and we have no jingle.

16:56.522 --> 16:57.954
I blew it.

16:57.956 --> 17:00.490
I tried to pull
the ultimate Simon Roberts,

17:00.492 --> 17:01.958
and I failed.

17:01.960 --> 17:04.461
Please stop asking yourself
“What would Simon Roberts do?”

17:04.463 --> 17:06.229
Why? You're the best.

17:06.231 --> 17:08.098
All I want to do is be like you.

17:08.099 --> 17:09.799
Maybe that's my fault,
but you know,

17:09.800 --> 17:10.834
after my heart attack...

17:10.836 --> 17:12.769
Uh, the doctor said
it was indigestion.

17:12.771 --> 17:14.337
Well, technically,
your heart stops when you burp.

17:14.339 --> 17:16.138
But you think to yourself,

17:16.141 --> 17:17.674
who's gonna fill your shoes
when you're gone?

17:17.675 --> 17:18.942
What about Sydney?

17:18.944 --> 17:20.477
Her feet are bigger than mine.

17:20.479 --> 17:22.244
You know,
I think I've been putting

17:22.247 --> 17:23.747
too much pressure on you
to be me.

17:23.749 --> 17:25.682
I feel like once
you ask yourself,

17:25.684 --> 17:26.782
“What would Zach Cropper do?”

17:26.785 --> 17:29.152
you're gonna be even
better than me.

17:29.154 --> 17:31.120
So what's your next move?

17:31.122 --> 17:34.023
I don't think there are
any moves left, Simon.

17:34.025 --> 17:35.391
Nonsense!

17:35.393 --> 17:36.893
These are the moments
when moves are born.

17:36.895 --> 17:38.928
You paint yourself
into a corner,

17:38.930 --> 17:40.763
then you find your way out,
and afterwards,

17:40.765 --> 17:42.699
whatever you did,
you give it a cool name.

17:42.701 --> 17:46.369
Yeah, but we've got no singer,
no writer, no jingle.

17:46.371 --> 17:50.006
True. Just scraps of audio
of two angry men fighting.

17:53.658 --> 17:55.978
Do you know the answer
and you're just not telling me?

17:55.980 --> 17:57.947
Maybe I don't and maybe I don't,

17:57.949 --> 17:59.115
but I'm sure you'll

17:59.117 --> 18:00.616
come up with something.

18:00.618 --> 18:02.418
Then I'll give it a cool name.

18:05.455 --> 18:07.490
(indistinct conversation)
ALLIE: Morning, boss.

18:07.492 --> 18:08.624
Morning, other boss.

18:08.626 --> 18:10.526
You seem like you're
in a much better mood.

18:10.528 --> 18:11.661
How was your date last night?

18:11.663 --> 18:13.462
I mean, if you had one.

18:13.464 --> 18:16.065
Yeah, how was Andrew?
If it was with him.

18:16.067 --> 18:17.867
You know what, I have been
completely unprofessional.

18:17.869 --> 18:20.469
From now on, it is going to be
all business, all the time.

18:20.471 --> 18:22.605
I'll be right back
with your guys' coffee.

18:22.607 --> 18:23.739
(sighs) Wow.

18:23.741 --> 18:25.374
Thank God it worked.

18:25.376 --> 18:26.876
LAUREN:
Hey, Andrew, you did it.

18:26.878 --> 18:28.344
You totally fixed Allie.

18:28.346 --> 18:29.712
I mean,
she is completely over you.

18:29.714 --> 18:31.881
What did you do? Were you just,
like, a total jerk to her?

18:31.883 --> 18:33.315
Oh, no,
that was a terrible plan.

18:33.317 --> 18:34.517
It was never gonna be followed.

18:34.519 --> 18:36.552
No, but thank you guys
for forcing me

18:36.554 --> 18:38.087
to go out with her again.

18:38.089 --> 18:40.022
You know, it's generally
against my nature

18:40.024 --> 18:41.991
to second-guess
my snap judgments,

18:41.993 --> 18:44.126
but turns out
I kind of like her.

18:44.128 --> 18:45.895
You do?

18:45.897 --> 18:48.030
Yeah, uh, you know,
once we let our guards down,

18:48.032 --> 18:49.832
it was-was kind
of like talking to you.

18:49.834 --> 18:51.100
Okay, here you go.
Oh.

18:51.102 --> 18:53.469
Thanks.
Thank you.

18:53.471 --> 18:55.904
Oh, Andrew, hi.
What's up?

18:55.906 --> 18:57.239
Um, listen, I read online

18:57.241 --> 18:58.907
that there's
a <i> Das Schlachtschiff</i> tournament

18:58.909 --> 19:00.776
at the University of Chicago
this weekend.

19:00.778 --> 19:01.810
No way.
Mm-hmm.

19:01.812 --> 19:02.978
That means Battleship.

19:02.980 --> 19:04.713
We have a mutual love
of German board games.

19:04.715 --> 19:07.015
(chuckles)
How anyone could pass up

19:07.017 --> 19:09.151
<i>der fuchs</i> over here
is beyond <i> ich.</i>

19:09.153 --> 19:10.686
ANDREW:
Where's your <i> Milch Kaffee?</i>

19:10.688 --> 19:12.221
I'll go make one.
Oh, thank you.

19:12.223 --> 19:14.089
That's milk and coffee
in German.

19:14.091 --> 19:15.190
(chuckles)

19:15.192 --> 19:17.559
Wow, they seem really
into each other.

19:17.561 --> 19:19.628
SYDNEY:
Yeah, they do.

19:19.630 --> 19:21.129
Oh, it's okay, Syd.

19:21.131 --> 19:22.598
We always want them
a little more

19:22.600 --> 19:23.999
when they're
unavailable, right?

19:24.001 --> 19:26.335
When I heard Gerald the
security guard got a girlfriend,

19:26.337 --> 19:27.903
part of me was
a little jealous,

19:27.905 --> 19:29.838
but then the bigger part of me
didn't want to get murdered,

19:29.840 --> 19:32.908
so I let it go.

19:32.910 --> 19:34.943
Oh, my God, Millie,
I can barely breathe.

19:34.945 --> 19:37.412
Brad Paisley is about to sing

19:37.414 --> 19:38.647
about our sauce.

19:38.649 --> 19:40.649
I'm dying. I just died.

19:40.651 --> 19:43.218
Ladies, get ready to have
your socks knocked off.

19:43.220 --> 19:45.053
Can I just say one thing?

19:45.055 --> 19:46.888
Zach, we've talked about this.
They want a jingle.

19:46.890 --> 19:48.323
I know, of course.

19:48.325 --> 19:50.625
It's just, I thought
I might have a better idea,

19:50.627 --> 19:52.027
but for-forget it,
go ahead.

19:52.029 --> 19:53.461
Well, if it's better,

19:53.463 --> 19:55.564
then shouldn't we hear it?

19:55.566 --> 19:56.932
No, no, I think
it's too extreme.

19:56.934 --> 19:58.466
I think it's fresh.
People these days

19:58.468 --> 20:00.235
don't have the attention spans
for jingles.

20:00.237 --> 20:02.103
I'm losing focus
from myself right now.

20:02.105 --> 20:03.238
Can't I?

20:03.240 --> 20:04.706
All right, fine,
do what you want.

20:04.708 --> 20:05.807
You always do.

20:05.809 --> 20:07.675
They're probably gonna hate it.

20:07.677 --> 20:09.310
Look, it's just
another way to go.

20:09.312 --> 20:12.514
Meet Satan's Tongue 2.0.

20:12.516 --> 20:13.815
It really

20:13.817 --> 20:15.283
packs the Paisley punch.

20:15.285 --> 20:16.484
PAISLEY:
Ow, damn!

20:16.486 --> 20:17.952
(giggling)

20:17.954 --> 20:19.254
We've all heard
Brad Paisley sing.

20:19.256 --> 20:21.789
What we haven't heard
is him howl in exquisite pain

20:21.791 --> 20:23.191
from your delicious sauce.

20:23.193 --> 20:24.526
And Brad loves
this sauce so much,

20:24.528 --> 20:26.194
he's willing to put his
voice inside every bottle.

20:26.196 --> 20:27.262
Ow, damn!

20:27.264 --> 20:28.329
Ow, ow, damn!

20:28.331 --> 20:29.931
I love it.
I'm dying again!

20:29.933 --> 20:31.332
ZACH:
Check it out.

20:32.134 --> 20:33.301
Ow, damn! Hey, boss? Yeah?

20:33.303 --> 20:35.103
I think I just came
up with my first move.

20:35.105 --> 20:36.671
It's called the
bicker and swap.

20:36.673 --> 20:38.539
Ow, damn! Great work, but you
know it's just a nod and switch

20:38.541 --> 20:41.476
with a disagreement at the top. You're
really not gonna let me have this one?

20:41.478 --> 20:44.078
You want the top of my mountain,
you're gonna have to push me off.

20:44.080 --> 20:48.509
So, ladies, are we good to go?
Ow, damn!

20:48.534 --> 20:49.730
<font color="#40bfff">Sync & corrections by</font> <font color="#FFA500">wilson0804</font>
<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

20:49.761 --> 20:51.586
- And mark.
- I'll do it for you, boss.

20:51.588 --> 20:53.354
- I'll give you Devil's Tongue.
- Give me Devil's Tongue?

20:53.356 --> 20:54.956
Ah.

20:54.958 --> 20:57.892
Look, Syd, Allie's a grown woman
and so am I.
