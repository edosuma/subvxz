WEBVTT

00:02.302 --> 00:04.470
All I'm saying is that
when you take a creature
into your home

00:04.472 --> 00:07.139
And you feed it
and you clean up after it,

00:07.141 --> 00:09.274
You don't expect him
to bark at you

00:09.276 --> 00:10.776
Every time you
walk in the door.

00:10.778 --> 00:13.012
Okay, first of all,
the creature has a name.

00:13.014 --> 00:14.613
It's ed.

00:14.615 --> 00:18.650
And vegetarian risotto
is not feeding me.

00:18.652 --> 00:21.153
A meal has meat.

00:21.155 --> 00:25.157
That's why meat and meal
are practically the same word.

00:25.159 --> 00:27.793
You should be thankful
I'm feeding you at all.

00:27.795 --> 00:30.396
The only thing I did
was make you think you
won the lottery.

00:30.398 --> 00:32.164
I didn't think
you were gonna leave

00:32.166 --> 00:34.600
The woman you were with
for over 40 years.

00:34.602 --> 00:36.635
That's because
you never met her.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.437
Hold on, guys.
Hold on.

00:38.439 --> 00:41.440
Even a snake and a mongoose
can be taught to get along.

00:41.442 --> 00:43.609
Of course, they don't have
to share a toilet.

00:43.611 --> 00:46.645
Ed, how fast can you
get back with your wife?

00:46.647 --> 00:48.647
I don't know.
I gotta get back
in my own bed.

00:48.649 --> 00:51.183
My insomnia's
acting up again.

00:51.185 --> 00:52.518
Have you tried watching
a little tv before bed?

00:52.520 --> 00:54.053
I don't know why
he'd have a little tv

00:54.055 --> 00:56.388
When the big ones
are so cheap now.

00:57.323 --> 00:59.458
I usually watch tv
before bed,

00:59.460 --> 01:02.428
But-- get this--
"gaybraham lincoln" here

01:02.430 --> 01:03.762
Doesn't have
a television.

01:03.764 --> 01:06.532
And, frankly,
I couldn't be happier.

01:06.534 --> 01:09.802
Now I'm reading
and thinking...

01:09.804 --> 01:12.571
Well, why don't you read
the ads in the Sunday paper

01:12.573 --> 01:15.207
And think about
buying a television?

01:17.077 --> 01:18.577
Oops, I thought
you guys were done.

01:18.579 --> 01:22.214
I'll just be
in the kitchen, charlie.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.283
Well, we're running over anyway.
What do you say we wrap it up?

01:24.285 --> 01:26.118
See you guys on Tuesday.

01:26.120 --> 01:30.155
Ed, patrick, try
to be more patient
with each other.

01:30.157 --> 01:33.158
So, like, how do you keep up
with the kardashians

01:33.160 --> 01:36.095
Without watching
"keeping up with
the kardashians"?

01:36.097 --> 01:38.397
'cause I'm keeping up
with voltaire.

01:38.399 --> 01:40.766
Is he the pool boy
on "real housewives"?

01:40.768 --> 01:43.302
Yes.

01:43.304 --> 01:46.505
Voltaire, one of
the greatest writers
of all time,

01:46.507 --> 01:51.477
Is the pool boy
on "real housewives."

01:51.479 --> 01:55.214
Well, I guess everybody
just wants to be on tv.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.788
So, where's
your new boyfriend?

02:02.790 --> 02:05.324
At home,
naked in your bed?

02:05.326 --> 02:07.559
Rolling around
in my alimony money?

02:07.561 --> 02:09.261
No, we did that
the other night.

02:09.263 --> 02:11.797
Tonight, we're using it
to make a papier-mâché piñata

02:11.799 --> 02:15.267
Shaped like a jackass,
but we'll need your picture.

02:15.269 --> 02:18.670
Jen, sean's got no job.
He lives in your house.
He eats your food.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.639
He's using you.
He's a sponge.

02:20.641 --> 02:23.509
He's "sponge sean
no moneypants."

02:25.545 --> 02:27.212
No, you're wrong,
charlie.

02:27.214 --> 02:28.881
Sean is kind
and considerate.

02:28.883 --> 02:32.351
And I'll tell you
more about him on the way
to bail him out of jail.

02:32.353 --> 02:34.653
- He's in jail?
- It was not his fault.

02:34.655 --> 02:37.656
We took the subway
to the long beach aquarium,

02:37.658 --> 02:40.359
Some guy grabbed my ass,
and he punched him

02:40.361 --> 02:41.894
In front of
an undercover cop.

02:41.896 --> 02:44.263
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Something's not adding up.

02:44.265 --> 02:45.631
Charlie, he was
just defending me.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.399
You would've done
the same thing.

02:47.401 --> 02:49.234
No, not that.

02:49.236 --> 02:51.603
There's a subway
in los angeles?

02:51.605 --> 02:54.239
Yes, la has a subway.

02:54.241 --> 02:56.241
Do other people
know about this?

02:56.243 --> 02:57.276
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

03:02.282 --> 03:05.517
( groans )
dude, thank you for
bailing me out of jail

03:05.519 --> 03:07.519
And for picking up the tab
at the drive-through.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.921
My pleasure.

03:08.923 --> 03:10.289
You know, I've never
seen any one person

03:10.291 --> 03:11.790
Spend more than 20 bucks
at a mcdonald's.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.492
Impressive.

03:13.494 --> 03:15.961
I don't understand
what happened.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.596
I mean, everything's
only a dollar.

03:17.598 --> 03:19.865
You ordered 20 things.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.867
You really don't
understand what happened?

03:21.869 --> 03:25.270
I gotta be honest.
I don't understand
anything anymore.

03:25.272 --> 03:26.405
I mean, come on.

03:26.407 --> 03:27.406
Why'd I have to
go to jail?

03:27.408 --> 03:30.776
How was I supposed to know
he would drop with one punch?

03:30.778 --> 03:33.278
Yeah, the little ones
go down pretty easy.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.781
He was,
like, 6'5", 260.

03:35.783 --> 03:37.783
Nerds come in
all shapes and sizes.

03:37.785 --> 03:40.352
You know what I found out
after the fact?

03:40.354 --> 03:42.221
He used to be a linebacker
for the chargers.

03:42.223 --> 03:43.889
Hmm. White guy,
though, right?

03:43.891 --> 03:44.923
Black guy.

03:44.925 --> 03:47.259
- Light-skinned?
- Charlie!

03:48.895 --> 03:50.495
Look, I know I shouldn't
have hit him, all right?

03:50.497 --> 03:51.863
But he insulted jen.

03:51.865 --> 03:53.565
Come on. What would
you have done?

03:53.567 --> 03:54.733
I woulda told him that
what he did was wrong

03:54.735 --> 03:55.834
And then disengaged.

03:55.836 --> 03:58.704
( chuckles )
yeah, chicks dig that.

03:58.706 --> 04:00.839
You know what chicks
really dig?

04:00.841 --> 04:02.708
Guys who
aren't in jail.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.409
You smell like french fries
and crime, dude.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.345
Take a shower.

04:06.347 --> 04:08.880
They're not fries,
they're nuggets.

04:08.882 --> 04:10.649
I got a bag of 'em
in my pocket

04:10.651 --> 04:12.384
And I am gonna
eat 'em later.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.786
( laughs )
burn.

04:19.359 --> 04:22.794
I just don't like him.

04:24.330 --> 04:27.332
Well, you were sweet
to bail him out.

04:27.334 --> 04:30.002
And I'm afraid the favors
don't stop there.

04:30.004 --> 04:33.872
The court says he has to go
to anger management therapy.

04:33.874 --> 04:34.940
Forget it, jen.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.776
Please, charlie.
Do this for me.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.444
He doesn't have
an anger problem,

04:39.446 --> 04:41.546
So he doesn't need to
talk about his childhood

04:41.548 --> 04:44.283
With one of those
court-ordered douchebags.

04:44.285 --> 04:47.586
Hey, I'm one of those
court-ordered douchebags.

04:47.588 --> 04:50.989
Wow, I really am bad
at asking for favors.

04:54.961 --> 04:57.796
Will you
look at that. My
connection's way stronger now.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.299
First throw.

05:00.301 --> 05:02.934
Who lands a frisbee on
the roof on their first throw?

05:02.936 --> 05:05.671
A guy who wants to learn
to toss a frisbee

05:05.673 --> 05:07.939
So he can meet girls
in the park.

05:07.941 --> 05:11.576
Well, screaming like one
when it lands on the roof
is not gonna help.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.346
Dad's right.
You're hopeless.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.083
Is this how you guys
talk about me when
I'm not here?

05:18.085 --> 05:19.484
Yes.

05:21.421 --> 05:22.988
Well, thanks for getting
my internet working again.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.390
I will see you
Thursday for dinner.

05:25.392 --> 05:27.726
And by the way,
I recorded your call

05:27.728 --> 05:29.528
For quality purposes, too.

05:29.530 --> 05:30.896
And you did great.

05:33.399 --> 05:36.935
Wait, you're dating a woman
you met on a tech support call?

05:36.937 --> 05:38.370
She was very nice.

05:38.372 --> 05:40.372
She doubled the speed
of my dsl...

05:40.374 --> 05:43.942
And tested it by sending
me some surprisingly
quick-loading videos.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.577
That's not fair.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.879
You just break up with kate
and you're already dating.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.114
Yep, I'm back in.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.582
I've been back in
for three years

05:50.584 --> 05:52.517
And no one cares.

05:52.519 --> 05:55.020
I'm this close
to getting a billboard.

05:55.022 --> 05:59.524
Well, don't use
your profile picture
from facebook.

05:59.526 --> 06:00.792
You look crazy.

06:00.794 --> 06:03.061
I'm trying to smile
like I know a secret.

06:04.063 --> 06:08.367
Is the secret
that you're crazy?

06:08.369 --> 06:08.600
<i>( paper crinkling )</i>

06:09.969 --> 06:11.803
- Hey, sean.
- Hey, charlie.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.638
Glad you could make it.

06:13.640 --> 06:16.508
Please take a seat
on the couch over here
with ed and patrick.

06:16.510 --> 06:17.843
I was gonna watch
some videos during group.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.444
Can I get your
wi-fi password?

06:19.446 --> 06:20.645
My password, sure.

06:20.647 --> 06:22.447
It's notonyourfrickinlife,
all one word.

06:23.850 --> 06:25.851
Look, if you're gonna
be here, you have
to participate.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.853
( sighs )
I thought this was gonna
be like traffic school.

06:27.855 --> 06:31.423
Watch a couple car crash
movies, go home.

06:31.425 --> 06:32.724
It's a little
different here.

06:32.726 --> 06:33.992
There aren't
so many car crashes

06:33.994 --> 06:35.827
As there are, you know,
train wrecks.

06:35.829 --> 06:38.397
Hi, I'm lacey.

06:38.399 --> 06:40.932
- Who are you?
- All aboard.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.834
I'm sean, hi.

06:42.836 --> 06:45.003
Look at you.
If I'd known
you were coming,

06:45.005 --> 06:46.805
I woulda worn
nicer clothes.

06:46.807 --> 06:50.609
Or fewer clothes.
It's really your
preference.

06:53.780 --> 06:55.080
Everyone,
this is sean.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.615
He's gonna be joining us
for the next six weeks

06:56.617 --> 06:58.984
Because of a little
nudge from the judge.

06:58.986 --> 07:02.421
( laughs )
what'd you do, sean?

07:02.423 --> 07:05.857
Uh, fight on the subway.
That's it.

07:05.859 --> 07:09.561
And they sent you here
all the way from new york?

07:09.563 --> 07:12.431
Apparently, there's
a subway in l.A.

07:12.433 --> 07:14.166
Well, I don't know how
we're supposed to be honest

07:14.168 --> 07:17.769
When our therapist
makes up crazy stories.

07:17.771 --> 07:21.673
Anyway, why don't we start
where we left off last week?

07:21.675 --> 07:23.508
Ed, how's it going
over at patrick's?

07:23.510 --> 07:26.445
Lousy. I'm still
not sleeping.

07:26.447 --> 07:28.880
William "shakesqueere"
over here...

07:30.049 --> 07:31.850
Still thinks he's
too sophisticated

07:31.852 --> 07:33.652
To buy a television.

07:33.654 --> 07:36.788
Yeah, well, maybe
you should read a book
for once in your life.

07:36.790 --> 07:40.892
Ralph...
"baldo" emerson.

07:42.061 --> 07:44.062
How do you come up
with those so fast?

07:45.665 --> 07:47.666
Listen, guys, guys.
We've talked about this.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.935
- You gotta find a way--
- ( imitating music beat )

07:49.937 --> 07:51.803
Sean.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.205
<i>Sean!</i>

07:53.207 --> 07:57.876
Sorry to interrupt your
top 10 bitchin' bro jams...

07:59.679 --> 08:01.012
We're trying to have
therapy here.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.547
I gotta be honest, man.

08:02.549 --> 08:03.882
I don't really care
about their problems.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.116
I don't know
any of these people.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.885
I know, right?

08:08.555 --> 08:12.123
<i>Because one phone call from me</i>
<i>to your probation officer</i>

08:12.125 --> 08:13.892
And you go to jail.

08:13.894 --> 08:16.194
God, why are you being
so mean to him?

08:16.196 --> 08:18.663
Can't you see
he's clearly handsome?

08:19.966 --> 08:22.901
I don't remember her name,
but she's very observant.

08:22.903 --> 08:25.637
It's lacey.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.806
Like my underwear.

08:32.945 --> 08:35.046
All right, all right,
that's enough.

08:35.048 --> 08:37.749
You either participate
or you're out.

08:37.751 --> 08:40.252
Listen, if you wanna
call my probation officer,

08:40.254 --> 08:44.689
Better yet, maybe I should
just find a different
therapist.

08:44.691 --> 08:47.859
I think that's exactly
what you should do.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.195
- There's the door.
- Oh, great.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.030
That thing over there?
Perfect.

08:52.032 --> 08:55.600
If you hadn't told me,
I would've just wandered
around here for days.

08:55.602 --> 08:58.870
( giggles )
he's so funny.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.072
By the way,
I hacked into your wi-fi.

09:01.074 --> 09:04.209
Uh, so everybody knows,
his super cool password...

09:04.211 --> 09:06.545
Therapystud47.

09:11.651 --> 09:13.718
I know it sounds like
an amazing coincidence,

09:13.720 --> 09:16.154
But that password
came with the router.

09:19.992 --> 09:23.662
Come on, puree
one time for daddy.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.797
- ( clicks )
- ( whirring )

09:27.600 --> 09:30.835
Ed, it's 3:00 in the morning.
What the hell are you doing?

09:30.837 --> 09:32.637
Trying to make
a milk shake,

09:32.639 --> 09:35.740
But first I had to fix
your stupid blender.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.642
Have you ever
connected the dots

09:37.644 --> 09:39.678
Between milk shakes
in the middle of the night

09:39.680 --> 09:42.847
And your current
silhouette?

09:42.849 --> 09:45.317
When I was at home,
my wife would get up

09:45.319 --> 09:47.118
When I couldn't sleep
and make me a milk shake

09:47.120 --> 09:49.287
And we'd sit on the sofa
and rub each other's feet

09:49.289 --> 09:51.923
While we watch tv
till we fell asleep.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.626
Yeah, ain't gonna happen.

09:54.628 --> 09:55.860
I wasn't asking.

09:55.862 --> 09:59.030
( sighs )
what are we
going to do, ed?

09:59.032 --> 10:01.967
How are we gonna
get you home?

10:01.969 --> 10:03.668
I don't know.
It was a bad fight.

10:03.670 --> 10:05.003
I said some awful things.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.671
Like what?

10:06.673 --> 10:08.340
Well, like she should
burn in hell

10:08.342 --> 10:11.610
Like every meal
she ever cooked for me.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.878
- Ouch.
- Yep.

10:13.880 --> 10:16.848
I told mark that
I hated his cooking, too.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.883
I mean, if you're gonna
kill animals for food,

10:18.885 --> 10:21.252
At least marinate
them properly.

10:21.254 --> 10:24.155
And then I told him
I hated his mustache.

10:24.157 --> 10:28.159
Weird, I told my wife
the same thing.

10:29.695 --> 10:31.963
Well, would you like me
to make you a milk shake?

10:31.965 --> 10:33.965
I'd like that.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.367
Then I'll tell you
the story about

10:35.369 --> 10:38.703
The horrible cruise
I took with my wife.

10:38.705 --> 10:39.838
What was so horrible?

10:39.840 --> 10:42.307
I told you,
I was with my wife.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.211
Think of the internet
as a freeway.

10:46.213 --> 10:49.080
Now, your old dsl only had
four lanes open to traffic,

10:49.082 --> 10:52.183
But with
the new bandwidth,
it's like having 12.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.719
Were you talking this way
last night at dinner?

10:54.721 --> 10:58.056
I don't know.
I was pretty buzzed.

10:58.058 --> 10:59.791
Oh.

11:01.961 --> 11:03.094
Mimosa?

11:03.096 --> 11:05.196
Sure.

11:06.132 --> 11:08.400
I really
like this shirt.

11:08.402 --> 11:09.968
Can I keep it?

11:09.970 --> 11:13.304
After last night,
you can keep the house.

11:15.708 --> 11:17.976
I just want you to know,
I have never dated anybody

11:17.978 --> 11:19.678
I met during
a tech support call,

11:19.680 --> 11:21.713
But I am really glad
your computer went.

11:21.715 --> 11:23.281
<i>( doorbell rings )</i>

11:23.283 --> 11:25.350
I'm sorry, I'm going to
have to put you on hold
for a minute.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.986
Please stand by.
Your booty call is
very important to us.

11:31.457 --> 11:33.024
<i>( doorbell rings )</i>

11:33.026 --> 11:34.292
Coming.

11:37.096 --> 11:39.297
- Hey.
- Oh, it's you.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.166
Look, I have a tech person
in the kitchen

11:41.168 --> 11:43.802
And they're not gonna leave
until I'm 100% satisfied
with the service.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.804
You banging
the computer girl?

11:45.806 --> 11:46.905
- Pretty much.
- Right.

11:46.907 --> 11:49.307
Look, I'll make
it quick, all right?

11:49.309 --> 11:52.811
Uh, I'm really sorry
about yesterday.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.779
What I did was stupid
and I would appreciate it

11:54.781 --> 11:56.181
If you'd let me
come back to the group.

11:56.183 --> 11:57.816
Not gonna happen, dude.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.084
You're not capable
of taking the process
seriously.

11:59.086 --> 12:00.785
Try me.

12:00.787 --> 12:03.722
All right, why'd you hit
that guy in the subway?

12:03.724 --> 12:05.790
( scoffs )
because he grabbed
jen's ass

12:05.792 --> 12:07.926
And he said some crap
and I decked him.

12:07.928 --> 12:09.160
That's-- I told you
that already.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.361
What did he say?

12:10.363 --> 12:13.498
( sighs )
he called me a boy toy.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.500
He what?

12:15.502 --> 12:16.901
He saw jen give me
a couple bucks

12:16.903 --> 12:18.436
And he called me
a boy toy, all right?

12:20.106 --> 12:21.906
Look, I just--
I have some stuff in my past

12:21.908 --> 12:23.174
That I haven't shared
with anybody

12:23.176 --> 12:24.909
And I'm a little
sensitive about it.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.411
Like what, were you,
like, a--

12:26.413 --> 12:28.780
( chuckles )
like, a male hooker
or something?

12:29.749 --> 12:31.750
Holy crap,
you were.

12:32.885 --> 12:34.352
Charlie, are you
gonna be a while?

12:34.354 --> 12:36.087
Yes.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.290
By the way, the term
is escort, all right?

12:39.292 --> 12:41.159
Ladies, they don't
order hookers.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.861
They order escorts.

12:42.863 --> 12:45.764
Well, sure,
<i>then</i> it's classy.

12:45.766 --> 12:48.266
So can I come back
to the group?

12:48.268 --> 12:51.002
- Yes.
- Thank you.

12:51.004 --> 12:52.504
It's 100 bucks
a session,

12:52.506 --> 12:54.439
But no kissing
on the mouth.

12:55.474 --> 12:57.509
I'm sorry,
I couldn't resist.

13:05.819 --> 13:08.286
We should stop them,
charlie.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.788
This won't be usable
in the study.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.856
It is not representative
of married sex.

13:11.858 --> 13:13.458
Why, because they're
enjoying themselves?

13:13.460 --> 13:14.993
( sighs )
please.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.327
They're putting on
a show for us.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.863
This guy's flapping around
like one of those

13:18.865 --> 13:21.833
Inflatable wind men
outside a used car lot.

13:21.835 --> 13:23.902
( imitates wind blowing )

13:26.005 --> 13:27.438
Really?

13:27.440 --> 13:30.175
Nothing
for the wind guy?

13:30.177 --> 13:32.243
I'm sorry. I'm a little
distracted right now.

13:32.245 --> 13:35.380
I've got this really heavy
piece of information

13:35.382 --> 13:37.916
About a guy who's living
with a woman I know

13:37.918 --> 13:39.284
And I absolutely
cannot tell you.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.152
Well, that's your call.

13:41.154 --> 13:44.389
When jen's boyfriend
was in his 20s, he was
a male prostitute.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.224
There, you happy you
squeezed it out of me?

13:47.393 --> 13:50.028
Wow. But if it was
that long ago,

13:50.030 --> 13:54.265
Because he's showing
he has no problem living
off money from women.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.601
He's doing the same thing
with jen right now.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.837
I can't tell her 'cause of
patient confidentiality.

13:58.839 --> 14:00.104
Well, jen's
a smart woman.

14:00.106 --> 14:01.539
She'll figure it out
eventually.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.508
You think?

14:03.510 --> 14:06.010
Did I ever tell you
that she once asked me
if wrestling was real?

14:06.012 --> 14:07.979
High school wrestling.

14:07.981 --> 14:10.548
Or she may not.

14:10.550 --> 14:11.983
But you can't tell her.

14:11.985 --> 14:14.118
It would be completely
unprofessional.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.620
Says the woman who
screams out "yahtzee!"

14:15.622 --> 14:17.956
When her test subjects
are done having sex.

14:17.958 --> 14:21.025
That's different.
Soundproof glass.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.493
Well, she's gotta
find out somehow.

14:22.495 --> 14:23.928
Ah, be careful, charlie.

14:23.930 --> 14:25.930
The apa takes
that stuff seriously.

14:25.932 --> 14:27.899
They're devoted to making
sure that psychologists

14:27.901 --> 14:29.634
Are held to the highest
standard of ethics.

14:29.636 --> 14:33.037
And, yahtzee.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.906
( laughs )

14:37.243 --> 14:39.110
Ta-da.

14:39.112 --> 14:42.213
Settle down.
I've already seen
your outfit for today.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.249
No, look.

14:44.251 --> 14:47.051
Ta-da.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.453
You bought
a television.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.989
Well, you started
closing the bathroom door,

14:50.991 --> 14:54.325
So as a thank-you,
I did this.

14:54.327 --> 14:57.462
Now you can get
some sleep.

14:57.464 --> 14:59.530
Well, thank you,
patrick.

14:59.532 --> 15:00.932
I'm gonna read a book,

15:00.934 --> 15:03.668
But you feel free
to just give it a whirl.

15:03.670 --> 15:06.671
Man on tv:
<i>I ain't here</i>
<i>to make friends.</i>

15:06.673 --> 15:11.576
<i>That some of the best</i>
<i>fashion ideas come out</i>
<i>of tuscaloosa.</i>

15:12.511 --> 15:15.213
Oh, god.
"redneck fabulous."

15:15.215 --> 15:18.249
I used to love
this trash.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.084
Woman on tv:
<i>I've seen better clothes</i>
<i>on a train-hoppin' hobo.</i>

15:20.086 --> 15:21.953
- Woman #2: <i>Oh, no, you di'n't.</i>
<i>- Woman:</i> <i>Oh, yes, I di-id.</i>

15:21.955 --> 15:23.421
Man on tv:
<i>Ooh, that's a country</i>
<i>catfight right there.</i>

15:23.423 --> 15:24.555
Woman on tv:
<i>Shut your stupid...</i>

15:24.557 --> 15:26.190
I mean, look at them.

15:26.192 --> 15:30.662
Why would people
even waste their time
on this garbage?

15:30.664 --> 15:32.563
I agree.

15:32.565 --> 15:35.366
Why don't we turn this off,
make a couple of milk shakes,

15:35.368 --> 15:37.568
And swap stories
about our exes?

15:37.570 --> 15:39.304
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

15:39.306 --> 15:43.074
( gasps )
I can't believe
jolene is back.

15:43.076 --> 15:46.377
And after she spit
on the other jolene.

15:48.013 --> 15:51.049
That bedazzled bolo
is everything.

15:54.153 --> 15:55.553
Hey, buddy.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.188
You're the guy who runs
trivia night, right?

15:57.190 --> 15:58.489
Yeah.

15:58.491 --> 15:59.958
What would it take
for you to use

15:59.960 --> 16:01.659
These questions
instead of yours?

16:01.661 --> 16:04.195
I'm trying to keep my ex-wife
from making a huge mistake.

16:04.197 --> 16:06.464
Whatever they're paying you
tonight, I'll double it.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.333
( loudly )
$4,000!

16:08.335 --> 16:11.169
- Dude.
- All right.

16:11.171 --> 16:14.105
Two hot dogs
and two beers.

16:17.409 --> 16:18.743
- Hey.
- Hey, jen.

16:18.745 --> 16:21.179
Hey, charlie.
Thanks for inviting me out.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.014
Well, I figured
you might be bored

16:23.016 --> 16:24.749
Since sean's out playing
poker with his buddies.

16:24.751 --> 16:26.651
Oh, by the way,
just so you know,

16:26.653 --> 16:28.286
He's playing
with his own money.

16:28.288 --> 16:29.520
Really?
Where'd he get it?

16:29.522 --> 16:31.255
Well, he sold me
a couple of his rings

16:31.257 --> 16:32.724
And a vintage guitar.

16:32.726 --> 16:35.560
Oh, my god.
You're a pawnshop.

16:37.129 --> 16:40.164
Okay, everybody.
It's time for trivia night.

16:40.166 --> 16:43.334
<i>Ladies, if you need</i>
<i>some hints, I'm up front.</i>

16:43.336 --> 16:45.136
Dudes,
not so much.

16:45.138 --> 16:47.038
( laughs )
I'm kidding.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.606
Look, I don't mean
to put sean down,

16:48.608 --> 16:50.575
But what do you really
know about the guy?

16:50.577 --> 16:53.478
I mean, like,
what did he do
in his 20s?

16:53.480 --> 16:56.681
Question one.
"what 1980 crime thriller

16:56.683 --> 17:00.184
Stars richard gere
and lauren hutton?"

17:00.186 --> 17:01.686
Oh, I know this one.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.488
- "officer
and a gentleman."
- ( sighs )

17:03.490 --> 17:07.425
No, jen. It was
"american gigolo."

17:07.427 --> 17:10.028
Remember, he got paid
to have sex with women?

17:10.030 --> 17:11.562
Maybe it was "chicago."

17:11.564 --> 17:14.132
He was great in that.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.633
I don't know,
I didn't see it.

17:15.635 --> 17:19.270
Was he paid to have sex
with women in that one?

17:19.272 --> 17:22.140
No, he tap-danced.
It was wonderful.

17:23.409 --> 17:25.443
Anyway, sean must have
mentioned something

17:25.445 --> 17:26.711
About his early jobs.

17:26.713 --> 17:30.548
Next question.
"what car manufactured by ford

17:30.550 --> 17:33.284
Was also released
by mazda

17:33.286 --> 17:36.687
Under the name
the 323?"

17:36.689 --> 17:39.424
I have no idea.

17:39.426 --> 17:42.160
I know.
It was the escort.

17:42.162 --> 17:44.228
Maybe it was the miata.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.264
No, jen.
It was the escort.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.331
I don't think so.

17:47.333 --> 17:49.133
Two things
we know for sure.

17:49.135 --> 17:53.071
"american gigolo,"
escort.

17:53.073 --> 17:54.572
"what civil war general

17:54.574 --> 17:56.674
Is best known
for his stunning defeat

17:56.676 --> 17:59.477
At the battle of
chancellorsville in 1863?"

17:59.479 --> 18:01.512
Hooker!
It was hooker.

18:01.514 --> 18:04.649
It's hooker, "american
gigolo," escort.

18:04.651 --> 18:06.217
There's a pattern here.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.319
You're babbling.
I'm going to the bathroom.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.789
Charlie, hey.
What's up?

18:11.791 --> 18:15.193
Hey, sean, what
are you doing here?
What happened to poker?

18:15.195 --> 18:17.161
It was a rough night.
Took a beating.

18:17.163 --> 18:18.529
But then I remembered
you were bringing jen out

18:18.531 --> 18:21.099
So I figured I'd
come join you guys.

18:21.101 --> 18:22.600
Are these your sliders?
Can I have these?

18:22.602 --> 18:24.469
Yeah, sure...

18:24.471 --> 18:26.771
If you tell jen
about the escort thing.

18:26.773 --> 18:29.340
I'm not gonna do that
because that is
ancient history

18:29.342 --> 18:31.576
And I already touched
this slider,

18:31.578 --> 18:33.177
So I'm gonna eat it.

18:36.315 --> 18:38.549
Well, if you don't
tell her, I will.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.751
( chuckles )
I'm not sure how
you're gonna do that

18:40.753 --> 18:42.887
With patient
confidentiality.

18:42.889 --> 18:45.623
This next question
is a combo.

18:45.625 --> 18:49.293
"007 was played
by blank connery,

18:49.295 --> 18:51.796
And what is the world's
oldest profession?

18:51.798 --> 18:56.767
Oh, and make it a sentence
by putting 'was a'

18:56.769 --> 19:00.538
Between 'sean'
and 'prostitute.'"

19:02.374 --> 19:04.475
What the hell
is your problem?

19:04.477 --> 19:06.377
If I have to make a choice
between protecting a patient

19:06.379 --> 19:07.678
And protecting
the mother of my kid,

19:07.680 --> 19:09.313
She's gonna win
that one every time.

19:09.315 --> 19:12.550
You know what?
I haven't done crap
to jen, all right?

19:12.552 --> 19:14.185
So why don't you
get a life

19:14.187 --> 19:15.620
And stop trying
to make it up to your ex

19:15.622 --> 19:17.355
For being
a cheating douchebag

19:17.357 --> 19:18.789
For so many years,
all right?

19:18.791 --> 19:20.658
( chuckles, grunts )

19:20.660 --> 19:23.227
- <i>( thuds )</i>
<i>- crowd: Oh!</i>

19:24.396 --> 19:26.631
( sighs )
what the hell's
wrong with you?

19:26.633 --> 19:28.599
( together )
sorry.

19:28.601 --> 19:29.901
I wasn't
talking to you.

19:29.903 --> 19:32.303
( together )
sorry.

19:32.305 --> 19:34.238
I'm going home.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.573
( together )
drive safe.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.311
This sucks
for you, dude.

19:40.313 --> 19:42.780
Please, you threw
the first punch.
You're going to jail.

19:42.782 --> 19:45.416
And when it gets out
that I assaulted a client
and my practice is ruined,

19:45.418 --> 19:47.185
Then whose money
are you gonna spend?

19:47.187 --> 19:48.719
Bang.

19:49.721 --> 19:51.289
Are you stupid?

19:51.291 --> 19:54.525
If that was the case,
don't you think
I'd find a woman

19:54.527 --> 19:56.694
With a more successful
ex-husband?

19:56.696 --> 20:00.198
Could you scoot over,
please, so I could elbow
you in the face?

20:02.201 --> 20:03.367
Yeah, well, maybe
I'd like to see her

20:03.369 --> 20:05.203
With a more
successful boyfriend

20:05.205 --> 20:06.637
Who doesn't blow
all her money on poker.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.406
You're a piece of work.

20:08.408 --> 20:09.707
You know what
I did tonight?

20:09.709 --> 20:11.475
I won big, all right?

20:11.477 --> 20:13.644
And I lied to you because
I wanted to surprise jen.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.813
There's a pile
of cash sitting on
her kitchen counter.

20:15.815 --> 20:19.350
Twice what I owe her.
So, bang.

20:21.386 --> 20:23.788
Another damn
trivia fight.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.456
What kind of questions
do they ask

20:25.458 --> 20:26.958
That drives you people
to do this?

20:26.960 --> 20:30.361
( sighs )
listen, there's no reason
to take us both

20:30.363 --> 20:31.429
Down to the station,
all right?

20:31.431 --> 20:33.664
I-- I attacked him

20:33.666 --> 20:35.299
And he was just
defending himself.

20:35.301 --> 20:37.368
Really? That saves me
some time.

20:37.370 --> 20:40.438
Let me get
those cuffs off.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.839
It sucks
to lose your job.

20:41.841 --> 20:44.775
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait.

20:44.777 --> 20:46.844
- Sean...
- Sean: <i>Do me a favor,</i>
<i>too, by the way.</i>

20:46.846 --> 20:50.715
Could you pick up my tab?
I ordered a bottle of dom
and some chili fries.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.850
Take him away,
officer.
