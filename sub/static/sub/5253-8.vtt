WEBVTT

00:00.085 --> 00:01.648
Previously on Awkward...

00:01.656 --> 00:03.498
Love is dead, and I killed it.

00:03.523 --> 00:04.889
Well, you fired the gun.

00:04.891 --> 00:06.424
I really messed things up with us.

00:06.426 --> 00:08.492
We were really good
together. What are you saying?

00:08.494 --> 00:11.228
- I miss the way we were.
- I love Matty.

00:11.230 --> 00:12.628
What did you want to tell me so bad?

00:12.636 --> 00:15.332
Would I ever forgive myself
for letting Matty go?

00:16.449 --> 00:18.541
I couldn't stop thinking
about my dinner with Matty.

00:18.566 --> 00:20.377
Sure, I had done the mature thing

00:20.402 --> 00:22.236
by not telling him that I loved him,

00:22.620 --> 00:25.605
but being mature felt a
lot like being miserable.

00:25.607 --> 00:27.707
It didn't help that it
was the most romantic time

00:27.709 --> 00:29.943
- of the high school year:
- _

00:29.945 --> 00:31.973
promposal season.

00:31.996 --> 00:33.481
_

00:33.482 --> 00:36.416
Well, some promposals were
more romantic than others.

00:36.418 --> 00:39.018
Either way, all they did
was constantly remind me

00:39.020 --> 00:41.620
that I would never have my
perfect prom with Matty.

00:41.622 --> 00:42.833
Because of me.

00:42.980 --> 00:46.725
Ugh, I just have to keep
my head down, blinders on.

00:46.749 --> 00:47.839
_

00:53.734 --> 00:54.846
Sorry.

00:55.703 --> 00:57.675
Hope she says yes.

01:02.142 --> 01:03.962
Synced and corrected by Chitorafa

01:03.987 --> 01:06.378
I get home and Val's lying on the couch.

01:06.380 --> 01:08.280
- Really?
- Just like last week.

01:08.282 --> 01:10.417
But again? Why does she do that?

01:10.442 --> 01:12.050
That is really Cr...

01:12.052 --> 01:13.223
What the?

01:14.839 --> 01:17.722
- Oh, who's it from?
- _

01:17.724 --> 01:19.690
Sorry, not for you.

01:19.692 --> 01:21.359
Watch your aim, a-hole.

01:21.361 --> 01:24.495
A paper airplane? Seriously?
Talk about amateur hour.

01:24.497 --> 01:26.864
His parents are probably
driving him to prom.

01:26.866 --> 01:28.966
All promposals are amateur hour.

01:28.968 --> 01:31.035
Promposal? What idiot
made up that word anyway?

01:31.037 --> 01:32.437
I always thought it was you.

01:32.439 --> 01:34.439
Despite being known for
my cutting-edge wordplay,

01:34.441 --> 01:36.006
Jenna, no, I did not.

01:36.008 --> 01:38.509
I would never compare a
prom ask to a proposal.

01:38.511 --> 01:40.812
Real proposals are amazing.

01:40.814 --> 01:42.806
If anyone actually proposed
with a paper airplane,

01:42.831 --> 01:44.759
they'd be kicked to the curb to die alone.

01:44.784 --> 01:47.557
Looked like Tamara was stuck
in promposal hell, too.

01:47.582 --> 01:49.816
She was clearly
still sad about Adam.

01:49.818 --> 01:52.253
We were both in a nightmare
of our own making.

01:52.278 --> 01:54.152
But was there a way
for me to break out?

01:54.154 --> 01:56.800
So, I was thinking about
maybe asking Matty to prom,

01:56.825 --> 01:58.056
as friends.

01:58.480 --> 01:59.591
What? What's wrong?

01:59.593 --> 02:01.693
You. You're wrong. Do
you even hear yourself?

02:01.823 --> 02:02.839
What?

02:02.864 --> 02:05.129
Your name is Jenna, and you're
an addict... a Matty addict.

02:05.131 --> 02:06.731
Come on, I'm not addicted to Matty.

02:06.733 --> 02:09.511
You're practically shaking
from Matty withdrawal.

02:09.526 --> 02:10.960
You did the right thing at dinner.

02:10.961 --> 02:12.369
If you go to prom with him, you'll relapse

02:12.394 --> 02:13.662
and start mainlining Matty.

02:13.664 --> 02:15.814
Okay, don't you think
you're being a tad dramatic?

02:15.839 --> 02:17.867
It's no big deal. Not a big deal?

02:17.869 --> 02:19.835
Let me paint a prom
portrait for you, Jenna.

02:19.837 --> 02:21.537
You and Matty go as "just friends"

02:21.539 --> 02:22.872
and then the first Adele ballad in,

02:22.874 --> 02:24.773
you start spilling your
feelings, you make out,

02:24.775 --> 02:25.841
and then you start dating.

02:25.843 --> 02:28.775
Ooh, hooray! No, not hooray.

02:28.800 --> 02:31.133
All summer long, the dark
cloud of long distance

02:31.135 --> 02:32.601
will loom over you and you'll be stressing

02:32.603 --> 02:34.236
so you'll get in tons of fights.

02:34.238 --> 02:36.905
Then, you'll be at Wyckoff in Maine,

02:36.907 --> 02:38.240
and Matty will be at Berkeley.

02:38.242 --> 02:39.942
You'll fly cross-country on the weekends,

02:39.944 --> 02:42.177
therefore you won't be making
any friends at your new school,

02:42.179 --> 02:43.846
and then when Matty
finally does come visit you,

02:43.848 --> 02:45.548
he'll go snowboarding, he'll break his leg,

02:45.550 --> 02:47.082
and he'll be walking with a limp.

02:47.084 --> 02:48.517
Not only have you ruined his soccer career,

02:48.519 --> 02:50.353
but everyone will call him Matty McLimpin'.

02:50.355 --> 02:52.554
All because you shared
your feelings at prom.

02:52.556 --> 02:54.256
Don't do it. Put down the drug.

02:54.258 --> 02:56.815
You need to go straight
from AA directly to Triple A:

02:56.840 --> 02:58.327
Avoid, Avoid, Avoid.

02:58.329 --> 02:59.594
Get out of my way!

02:59.618 --> 03:01.019
_

03:02.019 --> 03:04.128
Tamara had painted a
terrifying picture,

03:04.136 --> 03:07.404
and as much as I hated to
admit it, she was right.

03:07.406 --> 03:11.474
Matty was my drug of choice
and I had to go cold turkey.

03:11.476 --> 03:13.409
Hey. How did dinner with Jenna go?

03:13.411 --> 03:17.490
- Dinner wasn't what I expected.
- What do you mean?

03:17.515 --> 03:20.750
I don't know, man, I think I
totally misread her signals.

03:20.752 --> 03:22.051
So what about prom?

03:22.053 --> 03:24.087
She pretty much shut that idea down.

03:24.089 --> 03:27.656
She probably wants to
go with somebody else.

03:27.658 --> 03:28.839
Sucks.

03:28.864 --> 03:31.427
Sorry, dude. So who are you gonna ask?

03:31.429 --> 03:33.361
Well, it's funny you should mention that.

03:33.644 --> 03:35.994
Jacob, will you go to prom with me?

03:36.296 --> 03:37.530
Yes, Matthew.

03:38.869 --> 03:40.268
Seriously, come on, you've got to go.

03:40.270 --> 03:42.070
I know. I'll figure it out.

03:42.072 --> 03:43.872
Sort of confused about
lots of stuff right now.

03:43.874 --> 03:47.275
I hear ya. I can't believe
I didn't commit to a college.

03:47.277 --> 03:49.044
But why would I want to go
into enormous student debt

03:49.046 --> 03:50.846
for a school that I'm not excited about?

03:50.848 --> 03:53.447
You know one of the colleges
I got into used to be a prison?

03:53.449 --> 03:54.394
Yikes.

03:54.419 --> 03:57.462
I was thinking about
maybe taking a gap year.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.822
- Is that crazy?
- No, that sounds rad.

03:59.847 --> 04:01.846
Don't settle on a school
you're not psyched about.

04:01.871 --> 04:03.304
And, if you take a gap year,

04:03.283 --> 04:05.667
you can come to Berkeley
and party all the time.

04:05.692 --> 04:06.917
Yeah!

04:06.942 --> 04:08.697
Berkeley's right by Stanford and Gabby,

04:08.722 --> 04:10.856
so gap year could be perfect.

04:12.000 --> 04:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:23.101 --> 04:25.836
- Ugh, I hate her.
- Who?

04:25.838 --> 04:28.338
- Forget it.
- Okay.

04:28.340 --> 04:30.174
So I still need to talk to
you about the food truck.

04:30.176 --> 04:32.208
What, is there a bratwurst emergency?

04:32.210 --> 04:33.480
I can't really think about

04:33.505 --> 04:35.388
that moving health code
violation right now.

04:35.413 --> 04:36.300
But I...

04:36.325 --> 04:38.447
Sergio, what I'm trying to say is,

04:38.449 --> 04:42.351
I couldn't give less of a
[bleep] about the food truck.

04:42.353 --> 04:45.639
I have real-life actual
problems to worry about.

04:46.426 --> 04:48.193
I have to get to class.

04:55.132 --> 04:56.872
Hey, it's Sergio.

04:57.972 --> 04:59.672
Yeah. I'm in.

04:59.674 --> 05:01.239
Hey, what are we doing for prom?

05:01.241 --> 05:02.541
We?

05:02.543 --> 05:04.176
Actually, I just meant me and Cole.

05:04.178 --> 05:07.345
That is, will you go to prom with me?

05:07.644 --> 05:10.385
What? Prom? What's next, moving in?

05:10.410 --> 05:11.809
Are you guys lesbians?

05:11.811 --> 05:13.042
I didn't know you could hit rock-bottom

05:13.044 --> 05:15.044
after only dating for eight days.

05:15.046 --> 05:18.261
Yeah, prom is the gateway
drug to basic-ness.

05:18.285 --> 05:20.051
One second you're saying
"yes" to prom, the next,

05:20.053 --> 05:22.554
you're posting inspirational
quotes on Facebook.

05:22.556 --> 05:24.456
"Keep Calm and Carry on!"

05:24.458 --> 05:26.558
"Dance like nobody's watching!"

05:26.560 --> 05:28.570
Tell me how you really feel, Cole.

05:30.930 --> 05:33.163
Ugh, who does Namas-gay think you are?

05:33.165 --> 05:35.265
Some kind of brainless prom-zombie?

05:35.267 --> 05:38.034
Yeah. Totally.

05:38.937 --> 05:41.605
As president and therefore
head of prom committee,

05:41.607 --> 05:43.840
I have to give this
stupid survey to find out

05:43.842 --> 05:46.210
what people want the theme
for stupid prom to be.

05:46.212 --> 05:48.612
And why is Hamil-uggs hovering around you?

05:48.614 --> 05:51.481
- Hoping for a pity ask?
- I'm helping her.

05:51.483 --> 05:53.516
Yeah, so I don't have to deal
with this prom-ssignment alone.

05:53.518 --> 05:56.720
Anyway, the choices
are, Under the Sea, Y2K,

05:56.722 --> 05:59.151
Disco Madness, and Surf's Up Cowabunga.

05:59.176 --> 06:01.591
Those are the stupidest
themes I've ever heard.

06:01.593 --> 06:04.794
Who came up with this, a bunch
of monkeys on typewriters?

06:04.796 --> 06:06.529
We all know they're lame, so just pick one.

06:06.531 --> 06:08.620
It doesn't matter anyway. Prom sucks.

06:08.645 --> 06:09.690
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:09.715 --> 06:11.644
The only thing worse than not going

06:11.669 --> 06:14.247
with Matty to prom would be
going with Matty to prom.

06:14.272 --> 06:17.206
It was killing me, but I had
to pretend that I didn't care.

06:17.208 --> 06:19.494
What the hell are you guys talking about?

06:19.519 --> 06:21.644
Prom is the most important
event of our senior year

06:21.646 --> 06:23.279
before graduation.

06:23.281 --> 06:26.649
Embrace it. Go with someone you love.

06:26.975 --> 06:29.986
Not all of us are in love, you cloying sap.

06:30.011 --> 06:31.712
You don't have to be in love.

06:31.737 --> 06:33.191
You don't even have to be dating.

06:33.216 --> 06:35.345
Just someone you do love.

06:35.435 --> 06:38.136
It's a celebration of
our four years together.

06:38.152 --> 06:39.182
Hear, hear.

06:39.554 --> 06:41.887
I see you talking, Jake, but all I hear is,

06:41.889 --> 06:45.111
"Wah wah wah wah wah," like
Charlie Brown's teacher.

06:45.136 --> 06:46.642
I can't believe your attitude!

06:46.667 --> 06:48.227
You are the head of the prom committee!

06:48.229 --> 06:49.961
Show a little respect!

06:50.198 --> 06:51.740
Do you want to do it?

06:52.269 --> 06:53.574
Be my guest.

06:57.936 --> 06:59.270
Go with someone you love?

06:59.272 --> 07:01.239
That is exactly what is wrong with prom.

07:01.241 --> 07:03.659
It is an enforced romantic
Hallmark faux-liday

07:03.684 --> 07:04.709
for high school.

07:04.711 --> 07:07.512
I mean, you're expected to drop
tons of cash on a dress, limo,

07:07.514 --> 07:09.845
tickets, and dinner
just to dance in a Ramada

07:09.870 --> 07:11.056
off the freeway?

07:11.081 --> 07:12.717
90% of the prom-going public

07:12.719 --> 07:14.752
expect Pretty in Pink
and they get Carrie.

07:14.754 --> 07:15.753
And who profits?

07:15.755 --> 07:17.654
- Dry cleaners?
- The big corporations.

07:17.656 --> 07:19.623
It's the prom industrial complex.

07:19.625 --> 07:21.612
I wish I could just opt
out of the whole thing.

07:21.637 --> 07:23.681
Like how you can sign up
on the "do not call" list

07:23.706 --> 07:25.001
for telemarketers.

07:25.026 --> 07:26.486
There should be a "do not ask" list.

07:26.511 --> 07:28.009
Jenna, that is I Dream of Genius.

07:28.034 --> 07:29.600
We should totes make a "Do Not Ask."

07:29.602 --> 07:31.467
We can put it on the wall
in the senior hallway.

07:31.469 --> 07:33.536
And if you sign it, everyone
will know you're off-limits.

07:33.538 --> 07:36.339
No one should be forced
to go to this farce.

07:36.605 --> 07:38.472
Do Not Ask was the perfect solution.

07:38.497 --> 07:40.939
I wouldn't have to worry
about going or not going

07:40.964 --> 07:43.415
to prom with Matty, because
I wouldn't be going.

07:43.440 --> 07:45.799
No Matty and no prom-blems.

07:45.824 --> 07:48.456
Congrats, Jenna, although
you've always been my queen.

07:48.481 --> 07:49.389
Huh?

07:50.728 --> 07:52.594
The prom court nominees are up!

07:56.599 --> 07:58.401
Being nominated for prom queen

07:58.403 --> 08:02.471
meant that for me, "Do Not Ask"
had turned into a "Have to Go."

08:02.473 --> 08:04.225
So much for that plan.

08:05.217 --> 08:06.716
Being on prom court with Matty

08:06.740 --> 08:09.176
would have been sophomore
Jenna's dream come true.

08:09.201 --> 08:12.316
Hell, Jenna-until-two-days-
ago's dream come true.

08:12.341 --> 08:15.129
And the irony was that I was
the one keeping us apart.

08:15.154 --> 08:18.088
Okay, so everyone pair into
couples for the group photo.

08:18.090 --> 08:19.823
Remember, it's for the school newspaper,

08:19.825 --> 08:22.920
so don't look, like, weird.

08:23.668 --> 08:27.292
Well, would it be so bad if
we just posed as a couple?

08:28.927 --> 08:31.452
Hey, want to be posers together?

08:31.526 --> 08:32.967
Always.

08:35.024 --> 08:37.554
I love how you're the
perfect height for my arm.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.618
Nope, couldn't do it. Felt too good.

08:39.620 --> 08:42.308
He's too cute. Avoid, avoid, avoid.

08:42.332 --> 08:45.724
This isn't working. Hey, let's switch.

08:47.794 --> 08:49.839
- We belong together, Jenna.
- Sure, Kyle.

08:49.864 --> 08:52.426
I hated to be a snob,
but it was kind of weird

08:52.451 --> 08:54.051
that Kyle was on prom court.

08:54.076 --> 08:56.611
Hey, Kyle. Lookin' good, bro.

08:57.690 --> 09:00.624
Oh, no. Kyle was
nominated as a joke.

09:00.916 --> 09:03.917
Poor guy. He stuck
out like a sore thumb.

09:03.919 --> 09:06.587
Everyone else on prom
court was popular.

09:07.656 --> 09:09.915
Everyone except me.

09:10.717 --> 09:14.013
Four kings, four
queens, and two jokers.

09:14.543 --> 09:18.302
Okay, everyone say, "Prom Fairyland."

09:19.367 --> 09:21.567
Prom Fairyland.

09:21.569 --> 09:23.069
Avoid the tyranny of prom

09:23.071 --> 09:26.872
that corporate America is
forcing on you, sheeple.

09:26.874 --> 09:28.476
Sign up.

09:28.830 --> 09:30.566
Nice dress. Except you have a stain on it.

09:30.591 --> 09:31.786
What? Where?

09:31.811 --> 09:33.778
It's from the prom Kool-Aid
you've been drinking.

09:34.081 --> 09:35.913
Prom court is not a binding contract.

09:35.915 --> 09:37.648
You are a traitor to the Do Not Ask.

09:37.650 --> 09:39.150
Okay, so I got a little excited.

09:39.152 --> 09:41.619
- It's prom court, Tamara.
- You're only human.

09:41.621 --> 09:43.588
But don't worry, I'm not going to go.

09:43.590 --> 09:45.056
My nomination was a joke.

09:45.058 --> 09:46.724
A joke? Like, "Knock, knock. Who's there?

09:46.726 --> 09:48.126
Jenna the prom queen"?

09:48.128 --> 09:50.228
No, I'm the loser nominee and so was Kyle.

09:50.230 --> 09:53.730
This is sophomore year
Winter Formal déjà vu.

09:53.755 --> 09:55.973
It's not about a nomination.
It's about humiliation.

09:55.998 --> 09:57.216
That's not true.

09:57.248 --> 09:58.614
Don't try and make me feel better.

09:58.639 --> 10:00.706
I don't sugarcoat hard facts, Jenna.

10:00.708 --> 10:01.994
We voted for prom king and queen nominees

10:01.996 --> 10:04.755
the day you caused the blackout
and you were super popular.

10:04.780 --> 10:07.466
This is the result of your
literal 15 minutes of fame.

10:07.468 --> 10:09.434
Okay, so then why do the Julies look at me

10:09.436 --> 10:11.336
like I'm a piece of gum stuck to
the bottom of their Louboutins?

10:11.338 --> 10:13.511
That's their resting face.
You should know that by now.

10:13.536 --> 10:14.773
I had to admit,

10:14.775 --> 10:17.242
I was more than a little
relieved that I wasn't a joke.

10:17.244 --> 10:19.611
Did I actually have a chance
at winning prom queen?

10:19.613 --> 10:22.180
I can tell you're already
planning your acceptance speech,

10:22.182 --> 10:23.905
you sell-out.

10:23.971 --> 10:25.694
Wait, hold the tiara.

10:25.719 --> 10:27.252
Jenna, you have to win prom queen.

10:27.254 --> 10:29.238
Well, that was a quick turnaround.

10:29.263 --> 10:31.156
That way you can use
your speech as a platform

10:31.158 --> 10:34.685
to tell the assembled masses
how they've degraded themselves.

10:34.710 --> 10:36.027
I don't really think I'd make a speech.

10:36.029 --> 10:38.325
Take prom down from the inside, Jenna.

10:38.350 --> 10:40.750

11:51.465 --> 11:53.840
This is such a great day.

11:53.865 --> 11:55.666
I feel like I have everything figured out.

11:55.763 --> 11:57.162
You're going to prom with me,

11:57.187 --> 11:58.512
I decided I'm going to take a gap year,

11:58.515 --> 12:01.102
- I had a really good lunch...
- Oh, what now?

12:01.127 --> 12:02.527
I had a pepperoni personal pizza.

12:02.529 --> 12:04.161
No, no. The thing you said before that.

12:04.163 --> 12:05.607
Oh, I'm gonna take a gap year.

12:05.623 --> 12:07.122
As in not go to college?

12:07.124 --> 12:08.089
Just for a year.

12:08.091 --> 12:09.658
To do what, exactly? Travel?

12:09.660 --> 12:11.092
No, just stay home, save some money

12:11.094 --> 12:12.728
so I can go to a school
that isn't known for

12:12.730 --> 12:14.818
giving ex-cons degrees.

12:15.677 --> 12:19.000
But I will be able to
visit you all the time.

12:19.411 --> 12:22.803
Anyway, where should we
go to dinner before prom?

12:22.805 --> 12:25.069
I don't know.

12:35.684 --> 12:37.117
What do you think?

12:37.119 --> 12:39.320
I think this is the worst [bleep] promposal

12:39.322 --> 12:40.187
I've ever seen.

12:40.189 --> 12:41.721
What the hell is a promposal?

12:41.723 --> 12:43.390
Sounds like some weird rich kid [bleep].

12:43.392 --> 12:44.337
It is.

12:45.060 --> 12:47.922
I bought this. I have my own business now.

12:48.297 --> 12:49.763
I'm thinking about calling it Sergio's.

12:49.765 --> 12:51.131
What do you think? Is it too obvious?

12:51.133 --> 12:53.466
And why would you do something like that?

12:53.468 --> 12:55.402
You know, for our future.

12:55.427 --> 12:56.764
Our future?

12:56.966 --> 12:59.652
How does you staying here have
anything to do with our future?

12:59.677 --> 13:01.668
What do you mean? I'm going
to visit you in New York.

13:01.693 --> 13:03.359
It's not like you asked
me to move in with you.

13:03.361 --> 13:06.228
Did I have to spell it out for you?

13:06.230 --> 13:08.664
I faked my roommate application
so I could have a single

13:08.666 --> 13:09.997
and you could come be with me.

13:10.022 --> 13:12.368
I cannot believe that you
would make such a huge decision

13:12.370 --> 13:13.927
without discussing it with me.

13:13.959 --> 13:16.259
Like how you decided to go
to Columbia without asking me?

13:16.261 --> 13:19.029
That was Columbia. You bought a food truck.

13:19.031 --> 13:22.175
You just committed to
staying in this stupid town.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.089
Why continue this sham of a relationship

13:24.114 --> 13:25.107
for a few more weeks?

13:25.132 --> 13:27.239
Let's just put it out of its misery now.

13:30.921 --> 13:33.436
Sign up and take back your dignity.

13:33.461 --> 13:35.961
Prom? More like wrong.

13:35.963 --> 13:37.663
That kind of works.

13:37.665 --> 13:40.533
Turn in your prom ticket and
you'll enter a raffle to meet

13:40.535 --> 13:42.767
my cousin's cover band of...

13:42.769 --> 13:44.606
Paramore.

13:45.827 --> 13:47.989
Um, what are you doing?

13:48.014 --> 13:50.293
Oh, it's this totally brillz
idea that Jenna thought of.

13:50.318 --> 13:52.718
It's a Do Not Ask list so
no idiot asks you to prom

13:52.720 --> 13:54.124
and you can opt out of the whole charade.

13:54.155 --> 13:56.155
So Jenna thought of this?

13:56.157 --> 13:57.617
Interesting.

13:59.328 --> 14:01.204
Can I sign this twice?

14:02.063 --> 14:03.771
Actually, you know who should be on this?

14:03.796 --> 14:05.231
That girl who listens to The Fray

14:05.233 --> 14:08.467
and has the "99% angel" sticker on her BMW.

14:08.469 --> 14:10.136
She doesn't deserve to get asked to prom.

14:10.138 --> 14:11.537
Stop it.

14:11.539 --> 14:13.924
As head of the prom
committee, I forbid this.

14:13.949 --> 14:16.819
I forbid it.

14:18.757 --> 14:20.279
He got him a latte?

14:20.281 --> 14:21.747
Is it vanilla flavored?

14:21.749 --> 14:25.202
I think they spelled your name wrong.

14:25.319 --> 14:27.252
I think they spelled it right.

14:27.592 --> 14:29.487
Yes, I'll go to prom with you.

14:32.391 --> 14:34.226
- Sick!
- Traitor!

14:34.228 --> 14:36.127
- I thought it was sweet.
- So sweet.

14:36.129 --> 14:38.730
Except, Theo, I thought you
and Cole would go together.

14:38.732 --> 14:39.831
Because we're gay?

14:39.833 --> 14:41.166
For the billionth time,

14:41.168 --> 14:42.901
gay people can be friends with each other.

14:42.903 --> 14:45.180
But friends can go to prom.

14:45.739 --> 14:46.720
You're right.

14:48.741 --> 14:51.876
Lissa, would you like
to go to prom with me?

14:52.280 --> 14:55.579
I'm weighing a couple of offers, but yes.

14:55.581 --> 14:59.563
If I go with you, I'm guaranteed
to keep my second virginity.

15:00.086 --> 15:01.818
What the hell are you doing?

15:01.820 --> 15:03.120
I'm gonna show Cole that two can play this

15:03.122 --> 15:04.688
back-to-basic game.

15:04.690 --> 15:06.790
I have to show you my prom vision board.

15:08.327 --> 15:11.794
Everyone is drinking the
prom Kool-Aid, but not me.

15:11.819 --> 15:13.162
I don't even care about going to prom

15:13.164 --> 15:15.064
in a Stella McCartney gold sequin dress

15:15.066 --> 15:16.733
with a light pink matching corsage

15:16.735 --> 15:19.403
and drinking champagne
in a town car, not a limo,

15:19.405 --> 15:22.216
and getting a room at the Four
Seasons with all my friends.

15:22.569 --> 15:25.409
The more Tamara protested,
the more I could tell...

15:25.411 --> 15:29.139
she wanted to have the
perfect prom, just like me.

15:31.681 --> 15:32.915
Hey, babe.

15:32.917 --> 15:35.646
So I figured out how you
can spend your gap year.

15:35.671 --> 15:37.208
There's this inner-city tutoring program

15:37.233 --> 15:38.264
that you can volunteer at.

15:38.289 --> 15:40.825
Oh, and this law firm
is looking for interns.

15:40.850 --> 15:43.146
You can also take film classes at SC.

15:43.171 --> 15:45.738
After all that, you could
definitely reach for an Ivy.

15:45.740 --> 15:47.755
Whoa. Thanks.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.642
This is really sweet of you,
but none of this involves saving,

15:50.644 --> 15:52.567
let alone making any money.

15:52.592 --> 15:54.115
I already know what I'm going to do.

15:54.140 --> 15:56.307
I'm going to live at home,
help my mom and sister,

15:56.309 --> 15:58.343
and wait tables and that
way I can pay for a school

15:58.345 --> 16:00.611
that I'm really excited
about going to next year.

16:00.613 --> 16:02.646
Yeah, I get that, but how can you get into

16:02.648 --> 16:06.117
a school you're excited about if
you don't do anything exciting?

16:06.119 --> 16:08.186
Trust me, I'll figure it out.

16:08.188 --> 16:10.686
- But waiting tables?
- Why do you care so much?

16:10.711 --> 16:12.694
Because it's embarrassing.

16:13.339 --> 16:15.205
I didn't mean it like that.

16:15.234 --> 16:16.710
No, I think you did.

16:16.735 --> 16:19.599
I wouldn't want to embarrass
you when I visit you at Stanford

16:19.624 --> 16:22.406
and I certainly wouldn't
want to embarrass you at prom.

16:22.408 --> 16:24.619
I think we should find other dates.

16:30.030 --> 16:32.225
- Hello?
- We're closed.

16:32.250 --> 16:35.079
We'll be open for business in a few weeks.

16:36.179 --> 16:38.720
Oh, hey. I thought we were broken up.

16:39.549 --> 16:41.315
I didn't mean we were breaking up.

16:41.317 --> 16:43.818
I just... I've been so
stressed with this mom stuff

16:43.820 --> 16:46.187
that I haven't told you
about and I took it out on you

16:46.189 --> 16:47.989
and I'm really sorry.

16:48.014 --> 16:50.192
That's the thing with you,
Sadie, it's always something.

16:50.217 --> 16:51.945
Today it was your mom,
yesterday it was Ally,

16:51.970 --> 16:53.634
tomorrow it's going to
be the New York subway.

16:53.636 --> 16:55.296
I won't take the subway.

16:55.321 --> 16:57.770
Jesus! You know what I mean.

16:58.499 --> 17:00.365
It's always about you.

17:00.367 --> 17:01.889
When is it going to be about me?

17:02.155 --> 17:04.536
You haven't even
congratulated me on the truck.

17:04.538 --> 17:06.538
Congratulations. I'm really happy for you.

17:06.540 --> 17:08.840
I promise I will be better.

17:08.843 --> 17:11.157
Look, I'm sorry. I don't believe you.

17:12.030 --> 17:13.645
All I want to do is love you,

17:13.646 --> 17:16.501
and you fight me every step of the way.

17:17.499 --> 17:19.384
I can't fight anymore.

17:21.689 --> 17:24.921
So if you'll excuse me,
I got a lot of work to do.

17:40.343 --> 17:41.876
Who knew I'd actually be relieved

17:41.878 --> 17:43.999
to be paired with Kyle over Matty?

17:44.015 --> 17:47.449
He was sweet, despite
certain quirks.

17:47.451 --> 17:48.684
Let's rehearse what happens

17:48.686 --> 17:50.497
when we crown the prom king and queen.

17:50.522 --> 17:53.455
So let's just say Matty wins prom king

17:53.457 --> 17:55.691
and Jenna wins prom queen.

17:55.693 --> 17:58.294
Ooh, I'm so excited.
It's like the real thing.

17:58.296 --> 18:00.561
The universe certainly
had a sick sense of humor,

18:00.563 --> 18:02.798
and by "the universe" I meant Lissa.

18:02.800 --> 18:04.199
So, you guys will walk up to me

18:04.201 --> 18:06.254
and I'll place the crowns on your head.

18:07.004 --> 18:09.068
Come on. Come on.

18:14.677 --> 18:16.807
Then you wave to the crowd,

18:18.148 --> 18:19.714
and then you'll slow dance.

18:19.716 --> 18:22.851
Let's do it for funsies.
Okay, everyone else pair up.

18:22.853 --> 18:23.984
Stand back.

18:23.986 --> 18:25.652
There should be at least a five-foot radius

18:25.654 --> 18:28.310
between the winners and
the rest of you losers.

18:28.691 --> 18:30.691
Soak it up, Hamilton.

18:30.693 --> 18:34.161
Because an imaginary win
is all you're getting.

18:34.163 --> 18:36.044
Okay, dance.

18:36.069 --> 18:37.664
That's okay, really. It's fine.

18:37.666 --> 18:39.033
Come on, Jenna, it's just a dance.

18:39.035 --> 18:41.132
I said dance!

18:41.838 --> 18:42.924
Fine.

18:44.506 --> 18:46.106
Listen, I get it.

18:46.108 --> 18:48.575
You want me to go to school
2,000 miles away from you,

18:48.577 --> 18:51.378
you created a Do Not Ask list.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.913
Why, so I wouldn't ask you to prom?

18:54.467 --> 18:55.716
I wasn't going to ask you anyway.

18:55.718 --> 18:58.098
You made it perfectly
clear you didn't want me to.

18:58.454 --> 19:00.286
Just try to get through one stupid dance,

19:00.288 --> 19:02.756
even though you obviously
hate me now for some reason.

19:02.758 --> 19:04.658
I don't hate you. I did
all those things because...

19:04.660 --> 19:07.361
I don't care. It doesn't matter why.

19:07.616 --> 19:10.779
I got your message loud and
clear. I'll just stay away.

19:13.990 --> 19:16.137
Rehearsal isn't over.

19:16.170 --> 19:18.103
Every inch of me wanted to scream,

19:18.105 --> 19:19.620
"I love you."

19:19.841 --> 19:22.608
The only person I hated was myself.

19:22.610 --> 19:25.036
For putting us through this.

19:25.407 --> 19:27.240
Senior prom was
supposed to be a fun,

19:27.265 --> 19:29.461
once-in-a-lifetime experience.

19:29.486 --> 19:32.007
And we were all letting
it make us miserable.

19:32.032 --> 19:33.518
I couldn't stop thinking
about what Jake said

19:33.520 --> 19:35.086
at the lunch table that day.

19:35.088 --> 19:37.288
"You should go to prom
with someone you love."

19:37.290 --> 19:40.057
And I was going to do just that.

19:40.081 --> 19:41.249
_

19:49.514 --> 19:52.336
I know this seems weird, but I love you.

19:52.338 --> 19:54.364
Will you go to prom with me?

19:55.175 --> 19:58.826
Yes, yes, a thousand times yes!

20:01.713 --> 20:03.455
What's wrong?

20:04.092 --> 20:06.252
Sergio broke up with me.

20:07.905 --> 20:10.378
I'm so sorry, Sadie.

20:12.524 --> 20:17.045
Hey, you want to go to prom?

20:18.897 --> 20:20.138
Yay.

20:22.568 --> 20:24.069
Oh, by the way, I'm wearing red

20:24.108 --> 20:26.560
so I'll send you a Pinterest
board with your dress options.

20:28.702 --> 20:29.868
Perfect.

20:32.714 --> 20:34.240
Welcome to the Enchanted Fantasy prom.

20:34.265 --> 20:36.599
You could win a rainbow.

20:36.624 --> 20:39.725
Men do not understand the
importance of the prom dress.

20:39.727 --> 20:40.792
Even though I couldn't have him,

20:40.794 --> 20:43.130
I still wanted him to want me.

20:43.155 --> 20:44.762
Is this about Hamil-turd?

20:44.787 --> 20:46.592
I just always figured
you'd go to prom together.

20:46.617 --> 20:48.250
Cheers to a fantasy prom.

20:48.278 --> 20:49.343
Yay!
