WEBVTT

00:03.462 --> 00:07.633
"That everyone who believes
may have eternal life in him.

00:07.717 --> 00:13.347
For God so loved the world that
he gave his one and only son."

00:13.889 --> 00:15.099
Here we go.

00:15.182 --> 00:17.685
Yes, Sheldon?

00:17.768 --> 00:20.104
When you said God gave
his son to the world,

00:20.187 --> 00:21.939
did you mean Earth
or the universe?

00:23.149 --> 00:24.150
Earth.

00:24.233 --> 00:26.193
But if God created the universe,

00:26.277 --> 00:27.637
wouldn't he want
to save all of it?

00:27.695 --> 00:29.780
Yes, uh, he would.

00:29.864 --> 00:31.490
Then why did you say Earth?

00:31.574 --> 00:34.660
"Earth" is a synonym
for the universe.

00:34.744 --> 00:36.871
He's grabbing at straws now.

00:36.954 --> 00:39.540
So if God's plan is
to save all of the universe,

00:39.623 --> 00:42.293
that means a race of
octopus aliens light-years away

00:42.376 --> 00:45.421
- could only be saved by Jesus?
- Sure.

00:45.504 --> 00:48.132
- Even though they never would've heard of him?
- Yes.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.426
Even though his appearance
might be terrifying to them?

00:50.509 --> 00:52.386
W-Why would his appearance
be terrifying?

00:52.470 --> 00:53.971
He has four limbs
and they have eight.

00:54.055 --> 00:56.015
- Okay, that's enough.
- No, no.

00:56.098 --> 00:58.243
I prayed people would be
more interested in my sermons.

00:58.267 --> 01:00.394
I suppose I should've been
more specific.

01:01.103 --> 01:02.646
Sheldon, if
these creatures

01:02.730 --> 01:06.358
were born without sin, they
don't need to be saved by Jesus.

01:07.318 --> 01:10.071
What if an octopus Adam and Eve
brought sin to their world?

01:10.154 --> 01:13.616
Would they be saved by a human
Jesus or an octopus Jesus?

01:17.953 --> 01:20.831
<i>♪♪ Nobody else

01:20.915 --> 01:23.667
<i>♪♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪♪</i>

01:23.751 --> 01:26.295

01:29.256 --> 01:32.843
<i>♪♪ I am a mighty little man ♪♪</i>

01:34.970 --> 01:38.182
And then I said octopus aliens
didn't need to become Christian

01:38.265 --> 01:40.518
because they're not affected
by original sin.

01:40.601 --> 01:41.727
You should've been there.

01:41.811 --> 01:44.021
Pastor Jeff almost started crying.

01:44.105 --> 01:45.731
Oh, now I'm sorry
I missed it.

01:45.815 --> 01:47.775
That's your fault
for having a hangover.

01:47.858 --> 01:49.658
Or it's God's fault
for putting Sunday morning

01:49.693 --> 01:51.278
after Saturday night.

01:54.115 --> 01:56.093
- Meemaw, could you take me to Radio Shack?
- Hello?

01:56.117 --> 01:57.368
Sure, maybe later.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.619
Later's a little vague.

01:58.702 --> 02:00.162
Could you please
be more specific?

02:00.246 --> 02:02.623
When I'm good and ready.
How's that?

02:02.706 --> 02:05.459
Better, but I'd really
like to nail this down.

02:05.543 --> 02:08.838
Why don't you ask
your father to take you?

02:08.920 --> 02:10.631
- Dad?
- What?

02:10.714 --> 02:12.383
Can you please
take me to Radio Shack?

02:12.466 --> 02:14.135
I'm busy.
Ask your meemaw.

02:14.218 --> 02:15.886
I did.
She said to ask you.

02:15.970 --> 02:17.263
Well, ask her again.

02:17.346 --> 02:19.348
Seems counterintuitive,
but all right.

02:19.431 --> 02:20.599
Meemaw?

02:20.683 --> 02:22.059
Oh, Lord.

02:22.852 --> 02:24.270
Everything okay?

02:25.062 --> 02:26.605
No.

02:26.689 --> 02:29.358
Stephanie Hanson's daughter was
in a car accident last night.

02:29.441 --> 02:30.442
She died.

02:30.526 --> 02:32.319
Oh, no.

02:32.862 --> 02:34.530
My God.

02:34.613 --> 02:36.907
She was barely 16.

02:37.575 --> 02:38.742
That's horrible.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.245
Is there anything we can do?

02:41.787 --> 02:42.872
I don't know.

02:42.955 --> 02:44.498
Um... ugh.

02:44.582 --> 02:46.167
I need to call folks
at the church.

02:48.836 --> 02:51.338
Any more thoughts
on Radio Shack?

02:51.881 --> 02:54.133
Sheldon, do you
really think

02:54.216 --> 02:57.469
this is the appropriate
time to ask that question?

02:58.095 --> 03:00.514
I did, but now
I'm second-guessing myself.

03:10.691 --> 03:11.734
How you holding up?

03:13.319 --> 03:14.445
I'm okay.

03:17.448 --> 03:19.200
16 years old.

03:19.950 --> 03:21.368
It's just awful.

03:23.954 --> 03:25.623
It's all part of God's plan.

03:35.466 --> 03:37.343
How come we don't get
to go to the funeral?

03:37.426 --> 03:40.346
Why would you want
to go to a funeral?

03:40.429 --> 03:42.431
I've never been to one.

03:42.514 --> 03:44.492
When you get to be my age,
you get to go to plenty.

03:44.516 --> 03:46.560
That's, like,
a hundred years from now.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.563
You make it hard to love you.

03:50.356 --> 03:52.107
Do you really see a dead body?

03:52.191 --> 03:53.651
Sometimes.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.277
How close do
you get to it?

03:55.819 --> 03:58.155
Real close, if you want.

03:58.739 --> 03:59.925
And the clothes they're wearing,

03:59.949 --> 04:01.825
is that the clothes
they become a ghost in?

04:01.909 --> 04:03.494
Depends. In the movie <i>Ghost,</i>

04:03.577 --> 04:06.580
Patrick Swayze has on
the outfit that he dies in.

04:06.664 --> 04:08.582
Casper runs around butt naked.

04:08.666 --> 04:10.417
Maybe he died naked.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.587
That's fun to think about.

04:13.671 --> 04:16.423
And y'all wonder why
you're not at the funeral.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.098
Good morning, Peg.

04:24.181 --> 04:28.060
Well, it will be once this cup
of Sanka works its magic.

04:28.143 --> 04:29.395
Is Pastor available?

04:29.478 --> 04:31.522
Oh, he's on the phone
with his wife.

04:31.605 --> 04:32.982
- Oh, should I come back?
- Nah.

04:33.065 --> 04:35.526
He usually gets his groveling
done pretty quick.

04:37.528 --> 04:42.449
So... that little Hanson girl,
that was horrible, huh?

04:42.908 --> 04:44.410
Yeah.

04:44.493 --> 04:46.203
Reminds you that...

04:47.705 --> 04:49.290
life is precious.

04:55.713 --> 04:57.131
You're up, slugger.

05:00.676 --> 05:02.011
<i>Come in.</i>

05:02.094 --> 05:05.681
I have the clothing drive flyers
if you'd like to take a look.

05:06.140 --> 05:07.349
Thank you.

05:09.059 --> 05:10.644
You all right, Mare?

05:16.608 --> 05:17.985
No, not really.

05:18.068 --> 05:19.111
Um...

05:19.820 --> 05:22.406
I can't stop thinking
about that little girl.

05:23.532 --> 05:25.159
I understand.

05:25.242 --> 05:26.994
That's why it's important
in these times

05:27.077 --> 05:29.079
to take comfort in our faith.

05:32.708 --> 05:34.918
What if that's
not doing the trick?

05:35.669 --> 05:38.464
Events like this can
certainly create doubt.

05:38.547 --> 05:41.050
It happens to me more often
than I'd like to admit.

05:43.052 --> 05:44.345
What do you do?

05:45.179 --> 05:50.309
I roll up my sleeves and I work
even harder at serving our Lord.

05:50.392 --> 05:53.103
Mary, we each have
a relationship with God,

05:53.187 --> 05:55.022
and relationships
take work.

05:55.105 --> 05:56.106
Get out there.

05:56.190 --> 05:59.109
Help the needy,
start a Bible study,

05:59.193 --> 06:02.571
hug a stranger and tell 'em
the Lord loves 'em.

06:02.654 --> 06:06.533
But not a child.
That backfires on you, big-time.

06:07.785 --> 06:09.286
Thank you, Pastor Jeff.

06:09.370 --> 06:10.913
You are most welcome.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.666
Oh, and tell Sheldon

06:14.750 --> 06:16.126
I spoke to
my seminary professor,

06:16.210 --> 06:17.878
and the official ruling is:

06:17.961 --> 06:20.964
God would appear to the octopus
aliens in octopus alien form

06:21.048 --> 06:22.758
and save their
eight-legged souls.

06:22.841 --> 06:24.134
Praise Jesus!

06:30.516 --> 06:32.851
I should put that in a sermon.

06:38.190 --> 06:40.359
Hold on, hold on.
Thank you, God,

06:40.442 --> 06:42.587
for this food we are about to
receive and for the nourishment

06:42.611 --> 06:45.906
of our bodies, and bless the
hands that prepared it. Amen.

06:47.032 --> 06:49.118
We're doing this
at breakfast now?

06:49.201 --> 06:50.494
Yes, I think it's a nice idea.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.162
She's eating Count Chocula.

06:52.246 --> 06:54.248
Doesn't he play
for the other side?

06:54.331 --> 06:56.917
I'm so glad God blessed you
with a sense of humor, George.

06:58.710 --> 07:01.839
Mom, have you received any
distressing phone calls today?

07:01.922 --> 07:02.923
No. Why?

07:03.006 --> 07:04.567
Just wondering if
it's an appropriate time

07:04.591 --> 07:06.635
to ask if you could take me
to Radio Shack.

07:06.718 --> 07:09.096
Sorry, sweetheart,
I can't today.

07:09.179 --> 07:11.116
I have to bring this food
over to the Hanson family.

07:11.140 --> 07:12.683
Then I have my new prayer group.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.309
And after that,
I'm gonna get started

07:14.393 --> 07:16.478
on a faith garden
in the backyard.

07:16.562 --> 07:18.522
A faith garden?
What the hell is that?

07:18.605 --> 07:19.982
Language.

07:20.065 --> 07:22.568
It's an outdoorsy place
for me to speak to God.

07:23.152 --> 07:25.195
Don't you already
speak to him indoorsy?

07:25.279 --> 07:26.697
Yes, but in the backyard,

07:26.780 --> 07:28.824
I can enjoy the beautiful world
he gave us.

07:28.907 --> 07:31.577
You can also smell the
Sparks' chicken coop.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.287
Well, I think it sounds nice.

07:33.370 --> 07:34.955
Thank you. I'm gonna
need your truck

07:35.038 --> 07:37.100
to get all the dirt and
flowers and tools that I need.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.418
- Sure.
- Oh, oh, almost forgot.

07:39.501 --> 07:41.462
Can you keep an eye out
for a rock big enough

07:41.545 --> 07:43.172
to paint a Psalm on?

07:43.255 --> 07:44.798
I can do that.

07:44.882 --> 07:45.882
Wish me luck!

07:45.883 --> 07:46.967
Luck!

07:47.050 --> 07:48.844
Mm-hmm!

07:49.970 --> 07:51.138
Is Mom okay?

07:51.221 --> 07:52.639
How the heck should I know?

07:52.723 --> 07:54.933
She left. You can say "hell."

08:03.400 --> 08:05.527
<i>...our hearts
and stir us to action.</i>

08:05.611 --> 08:06.945

Let 'em hear ya in heaven!

08:16.163 --> 08:18.290

to build this faith garden
and for your eternal love.

09:23.855 --> 09:28.360
Also, please look after
the Hanson family

09:28.443 --> 09:31.697
to find strength...

09:31.780 --> 09:33.699
in their time of grief.

09:36.785 --> 09:41.290
And I thank you
for the years they had

with their beautiful daughter.

<i>♪♪ I eat cannibal ♪♪</i>

So when you gonna take me
to get my learner's permit?

10:04.229 --> 10:06.064
Georgie, you've heard us
talking to Sheldon

10:06.148 --> 10:08.900
about asking questions
at inappropriate times, right?

10:08.984 --> 10:10.319
Yeah, so?

10:10.402 --> 10:12.279
So, given what's
happened this week,

10:12.362 --> 10:13.464
do you think
it's an appropriate time

10:13.488 --> 10:14.615
to be talking about driving?

10:15.532 --> 10:17.659
Why? 'Cause that girl died?

10:17.743 --> 10:20.704
Yes, that.

10:20.787 --> 10:23.624
For your information,
I'd be an excellent driver.

10:23.707 --> 10:26.752
I wouldn't trust you
to push a shopping cart.

10:26.835 --> 10:28.313
Would you feel more
confident if I told you

10:28.337 --> 10:29.880
I already know how to drive?

10:29.963 --> 10:32.591
- Video games don't count.
- I'll have you know

10:32.674 --> 10:34.593
I've driven Meemaw's car.

10:34.676 --> 10:37.638
I also drove your truck one night
while you were sleeping.

10:39.097 --> 10:40.474
Are you crazy?!

10:40.557 --> 10:42.893
I parked it and everything.
You had no idea.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.688
Okay, let...

10:47.356 --> 10:48.440
let me get this straight...

10:48.523 --> 10:50.923
you're trying to prove to me
that you're a responsible person

10:50.984 --> 10:52.944
by admitting you stole my truck.

10:53.028 --> 10:56.615
I said I was responsible.
Never said I was smart.

11:02.412 --> 11:04.206
- Hey.
- Let's go out.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.625
- Go out where?
- I don't know,

11:06.708 --> 11:10.212
Dairy Queen, shooting range,
line dancing?

11:10.921 --> 11:12.422
Have you been drinking?

11:12.506 --> 11:15.759
I might've had a wine cooler
or two.

11:15.842 --> 11:18.595
Sweetheart, that ain't drinking.

11:28.146 --> 11:30.691
The bartender
asked to see my I.D.

11:30.774 --> 11:33.151
Honey, he does that to get tips.

11:33.235 --> 11:34.945
He asked me for mine, too.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.906
Well, I like to think we're both
young attractive ladies.

11:37.989 --> 11:39.825
To that old fart? Yeah.

11:43.495 --> 11:44.996
- Mmm.
- Whoa.

11:45.080 --> 11:47.040
Whoa, pace yourself, cowgirl.

11:47.124 --> 11:48.667
I'm fine.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.377
Now, are we gonna shoot pool
or not?

11:50.460 --> 11:51.878
You bet.

11:55.257 --> 11:56.425
Hmm!

11:56.508 --> 11:58.385
Did you know George and I
used to come here

11:58.468 --> 11:59.845
when we first started dating?

11:59.928 --> 12:01.346
Is that so?

12:01.430 --> 12:03.032
He kissed me right over there
in that booth.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.684
Why, was there some
barbecue sauce on your face?

12:06.727 --> 12:07.894
It's a fat joke.

12:07.978 --> 12:10.814
I got it, Mom.

12:10.897 --> 12:13.400
Come on.
Come on.

12:14.985 --> 12:16.862
Why are you putting us to bed?

12:16.945 --> 12:19.072
- 'Cause your mother's out.
- Where is she?

12:19.156 --> 12:20.258
She's with your grandmother.

12:20.282 --> 12:21.602
- Where'd they go?
- I don't know.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.994
- Why don't you know?
- Because I'm here with you.

12:26.705 --> 12:28.331
Good night. Sweet dreams.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.916
Mom gives us kisses.

12:33.628 --> 12:35.005
Fine.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.010
Mm, your beard's scratchy.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.219
Too bad. Sheldon?

12:41.303 --> 12:42.846
I respectfully pass.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.600
Mom also does
the good night dance.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.521
Now you're just screwing
with me.

12:51.605 --> 12:53.231
Night.

12:54.858 --> 12:57.152
You should've gone with
"sings us a lullaby."

12:57.736 --> 12:59.654
Yeah, I got cocky.

13:00.405 --> 13:03.742
Slow down there, sister.
You got church in the morning.

13:03.825 --> 13:05.285
Who says I'm going?

13:06.620 --> 13:08.830
What is happening with you?

13:10.415 --> 13:12.000
Do you really want to know?

13:17.297 --> 13:21.176
So, the other day
I was making a casserole

13:21.259 --> 13:23.345
to bring over to the Hansons,

13:23.428 --> 13:26.348
and I wanted to include
a sympathy card.

13:26.431 --> 13:29.017
So I started to write...

13:30.644 --> 13:32.979
"Your daughter's
in a better place."

13:35.649 --> 13:37.734
And I had to stop.

13:44.741 --> 13:48.954
Because how could that
possibly be true?

13:49.037 --> 13:50.831
How could a better place
be anywhere

13:50.914 --> 13:54.334
than at home
safe with her family?

13:56.169 --> 13:57.921
She was just a little kid.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.548
That could've...

14:00.799 --> 14:03.677
been Georgie behind the wheel.

14:09.516 --> 14:13.353
How could that possibly
be God's plan?

14:15.522 --> 14:18.441
Looks like you could use
a shoulder to cry on.

14:20.318 --> 14:23.280
No, she does not need
a shoulder to cry on,

14:23.363 --> 14:26.241
but I do need a place
to store my pool stick.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.369
Maybe I'd like that.

14:29.452 --> 14:31.496
Get.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.421
What the hell?

14:40.797 --> 14:42.716
Your problem now.

14:42.799 --> 14:43.800
- Ooh.
- Watch it.

14:43.884 --> 14:44.968
Here.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.320
What am I supposed to do
with her?

14:46.344 --> 14:48.013
I don't know.
But be careful.

14:48.096 --> 14:49.264
Last time she was this drunk,

14:49.347 --> 14:50.765
you ended up
with your first son.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.268
Night.

14:53.351 --> 14:56.313
He's not that fat, Mom!

15:06.573 --> 15:07.925
Now you're cooking breakfast
for us?

15:07.949 --> 15:09.242
Your mom's not feeling well.

15:09.326 --> 15:10.911
- Is she contagious?
- No.

15:10.994 --> 15:12.203
Just tired.

15:12.871 --> 15:14.331
Did you check her for ticks?

15:14.414 --> 15:16.333
Soon as she wakes up.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.852
You can check her
while she's asleep.

15:17.876 --> 15:18.876
Sit down!

15:22.255 --> 15:23.924
Do you even know how to cook?

15:24.591 --> 15:27.218
Believe it or not, I am capable
of making breakfast.

15:27.302 --> 15:30.013
Sorry. It's not like we see you
do much around here.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.223
How 'bout,
"Thanks for cooking, Dad"?

15:33.099 --> 15:35.685
Chocolate chips?
Thanks for cooking, Dad.

15:36.978 --> 15:38.688
Is Mom going to church?

15:38.772 --> 15:40.732
I don't think she's up to it.

15:41.816 --> 15:43.485
But she never misses church.

15:48.823 --> 15:50.742
Are you feeling better?

15:50.825 --> 15:53.203
Yes, baby, I'm fine.

15:53.286 --> 15:54.788
All right, here we go.

15:56.039 --> 15:58.249
Chocolate chips for breakfast
and pizza for dinner?

15:58.333 --> 15:59.668
I'm loving Dad.

16:01.086 --> 16:02.587
Where were you last night?

16:02.671 --> 16:05.090
- Out with your grandmother.
- But where'd you go?

16:05.173 --> 16:07.092
- Enough questions.
- Y'all ask me questions

16:07.175 --> 16:08.760
when I come home late.

16:08.843 --> 16:11.638
Oh, I can explain that. You're
an idiot and we don't trust you.

16:14.391 --> 16:16.351
Mom, you didn't say grace.

16:17.727 --> 16:19.562
Don't worry about it.

16:22.107 --> 16:23.775
Come on, y'all.

16:30.073 --> 16:31.491
Can I sit with you?

16:32.617 --> 16:35.161
I think Mommy needs to
be alone right now.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.247
All right.

16:45.922 --> 16:47.716
Mom, I'm scared.

16:47.799 --> 16:49.050
Why?

16:49.134 --> 16:50.510
You didn't go to church,

16:50.593 --> 16:52.095
you stopped saying grace.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.264
I don't understand
what's going on.

16:57.392 --> 16:59.185
It's kind of hard to explain.

17:00.562 --> 17:01.813
Is it me?

17:01.896 --> 17:03.273
Did I do something wrong?

17:03.356 --> 17:05.400
Of course not.

17:05.483 --> 17:06.818
Come here.

17:10.446 --> 17:13.491
Sheldon...

17:14.659 --> 17:16.828
faith means believing
in something

17:16.911 --> 17:20.123
you can't know
for sure is real.

17:22.584 --> 17:27.130
And right now,
I am struggling with that.

17:27.213 --> 17:29.841
So you don't believe
in God anymore?

17:31.051 --> 17:33.803
That isn't something
for you to worry about.

17:33.887 --> 17:35.680
I need to figure this out myself.

17:35.764 --> 17:38.808
Can I help? Maybe I could
provide a fresh perspective.

17:39.851 --> 17:41.561
I don't think so, baby.

17:47.358 --> 17:48.860
Did you know that if gravity

17:48.943 --> 17:50.236
were slightly
more powerful,

17:50.320 --> 17:52.447
the universe would
collapse into a ball?

17:53.156 --> 17:54.574
I did not.

17:55.325 --> 17:58.703
Also, if gravity were
slightly less powerful,

17:58.787 --> 18:00.371
the universe would fly apart

18:00.455 --> 18:02.707
and there would be
no stars or planets.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.251
Where you going
with this, Sheldon?

18:05.877 --> 18:08.171
It's just that gravity
is precisely as strong

18:08.254 --> 18:09.589
as it needs to be.

18:10.173 --> 18:12.550
And if the ratio of the
electromagnetic force

18:12.634 --> 18:14.511
to the strong force
wasn't one percent,

18:14.594 --> 18:16.054
life wouldn't exist.

18:16.137 --> 18:18.348
What are the odds that
would happen all by itself?

18:19.808 --> 18:22.602
Why are you trying to convince me
to believe in God?

18:22.685 --> 18:24.312
You don't believe in God.

18:24.395 --> 18:26.189
I don't, but the precision
of the universe

18:26.272 --> 18:29.484
at least makes it logical
to conclude there's a creator.

18:33.238 --> 18:38.409
Baby, I appreciate what you're
trying to do, but...

18:38.493 --> 18:40.662
logic is here.

18:41.412 --> 18:43.998
And my problem is here.

18:46.501 --> 18:49.963
Well, there are five billion
people on this planet

18:50.046 --> 18:52.757
and you're the
perfect mom for me.

18:52.841 --> 18:54.634
What are the odds of that?

19:01.015 --> 19:02.600
Oh.

19:03.935 --> 19:07.897
Thank you, Lord,
for this little boy.

19:07.981 --> 19:12.360
I knew I could fix it.

19:12.443 --> 19:15.655
Maybe it was you
and the Lord.

19:16.197 --> 19:17.782
<i>I don't like sharing credit,</i>

19:17.866 --> 19:20.066
<i>but I knew in that moment
it wasn't the appropriate time</i>

19:20.118 --> 19:21.995
<i>to say it.</i>

19:32.046 --> 19:35.925
And Jacob said: "For I have
seen God face to face,

19:36.009 --> 19:38.178
and my life is preserved."

19:38.803 --> 19:40.805
Is this
an appropriate time to mention

19:40.889 --> 19:43.933
that John 1:18 says,
"No man hath seen God

19:44.017 --> 19:45.935
at any time."
Who's right?

19:46.019 --> 19:47.103
Jacob or John?

19:48.354 --> 19:50.064
Let's talk about it
in the car.

19:50.148 --> 19:51.316
...the Lord.

19:51.399 --> 19:52.400
Yes, Connie?

19:52.483 --> 19:54.152
My grandson has a question.

19:56.613 --> 19:57.989
Let 'er rip, kid.
