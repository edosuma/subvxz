00:45.947 --> 00:47.699
Danny, give me my shirt!

00:47.867 --> 00:49.698
Come and get it.

01:18.667 --> 01:22.580
Don't you think that maybe we're taking
this hazing thing a little bit too far?

01:22.747 --> 01:24.226
I absolutely do not.

01:25.547 --> 01:26.616
Hey!

01:27.947 --> 01:29.096
Cassidy!

01:46.027 --> 01:48.541
- Hey, give me a beer. Come on, man.
- Get your own, pretty boy.

01:48.707 --> 01:50.140
- Don't be a dick.
- Get your own.

01:50.307 --> 01:53.424
Hey, move it, douche bag. Get out of here.

01:54.307 --> 01:56.104
Mmm. Sudsy!

01:57.187 --> 02:00.338
Hey, Chugs! Give me a beer! And a BJ.

02:15.027 --> 02:16.301
Hey, what the fuck?

02:48.867 --> 02:51.620
Hey, no! You both, out! Now!

02:53.147 --> 02:54.819
Some massive titties!

03:03.107 --> 03:04.142
How long have you been a Theta?

03:04.307 --> 03:06.025
- Do you want one?
- No, thanks.

03:08.627 --> 03:11.346
- Hey, Ellie, up here.
- I got to go. Sorry.

03:11.827 --> 03:13.499
It wasn't that hard a question.

03:19.507 --> 03:20.701
Asshole!

03:26.307 --> 03:28.867
- Where are we going, Claire?
- Hurry up. Jessica's waiting.

03:30.067 --> 03:33.742
Goodbye, virginity! Yeah! Theta Pi rules!

03:35.107 --> 03:37.985
I think I'm gonna be sick. Look out below!

03:40.667 --> 03:42.146
Heather, get a room.

03:44.307 --> 03:47.583
Hey, boys. Out, out, out!

03:48.627 --> 03:50.697
- I just got tested. It's cool.
- Okay.

03:52.587 --> 03:54.305
Cassidy, my room, Theta toast, now.

03:54.467 --> 03:57.106
- Have you seen Andy?
- Hos before bros.

03:57.587 --> 03:59.498
Uh, Claire, line up those shots!

03:59.667 --> 04:02.056
None of that Jell-O crap.
Mama needs to get her buzz on.

04:02.227 --> 04:03.342
Thetas!

04:03.507 --> 04:05.498
This party kicks off our senior year.

04:06.787 --> 04:10.780
But first, shout outs. Claire,
I like being your friend, because

04:11.627 --> 04:14.266
it makes me multi-cultural
without having to do anything.

04:15.627 --> 04:18.459
- That's so racist.
- Okay. Okay.

04:19.067 --> 04:21.786
Chugs, I love you, because
you're always willing to try anything new

04:21.947 --> 04:23.983
and you don't give a damn
what anyone thinks.

04:24.147 --> 04:26.422
Is this a bad time to tell you
I boned your dad?

04:28.187 --> 04:29.256
Gross.

04:29.667 --> 04:31.225
It was after the divorce.

04:32.707 --> 04:36.063
Ellie, I love you because you are
always there to help with homework.

04:36.227 --> 04:37.979
You're like a spell check with a nice rack.

04:40.107 --> 04:43.782
Okay, Cass, I love you
because you're so real.

04:43.947 --> 04:46.142
That's just because
she can't afford fake ones.

04:47.467 --> 04:50.823
I love you, Jessica,
because you make being a bitch an art form.

04:51.827 --> 04:52.862
Hear, hear!

04:53.307 --> 04:56.982
Theta Pi, we honor thee!
From life to death, sorority!

05:00.867 --> 05:03.062
Wait, wait, wait, where's Megan?
She should be here for this.

05:03.227 --> 05:05.343
Oh, I forgot.

05:05.867 --> 05:08.904
Let me show you something
that is sure to be a YouTube classic.

05:10.347 --> 05:12.383
Gather round, ladies.
Chugs, grab the laptop.

05:12.547 --> 05:13.866
What are you guys up to?

05:16.267 --> 05:17.905
<i>- Baby, I love you so much.
- Oh, my God.</i>

05:18.067 --> 05:19.261
Is that Garret?

05:19.427 --> 05:21.497
I thought Megan dumped him
after he cheated on her.

05:21.667 --> 05:24.500
Well, apparently, she took him back.

05:24.667 --> 05:26.976
- What can I say? My brother's good in bed.
- Chugs.

05:27.147 --> 05:28.739
- That's so gross.
- You guys are sick.

05:28.907 --> 05:30.579
Did Megan get a little work done
over the summer?

05:30.747 --> 05:33.136
What? You thought she gained
four bra sizes in three months?

05:33.907 --> 05:35.659
God, is this all he's got?

05:35.827 --> 05:38.057
Yeah, what is this?
The Dry Hump Olympics?

05:41.627 --> 05:44.141
- Come on, guys, this is gross.
- Oh, my God.

05:44.587 --> 05:45.542
Why isn't she moving?

05:45.707 --> 05:47.698
We gave Garret a little something
to put into her drink.

05:47.867 --> 05:49.095
Told him it'd help put her in the mood.

05:49.267 --> 05:51.258
You let your brother give her roofies?

05:51.427 --> 05:52.746
Come on, roofie sex isn't that bad.

05:52.907 --> 05:54.625
You get laid
and you get a good night's sleep.

05:55.867 --> 05:57.300
- It's true.
- Chugs.

05:58.507 --> 06:00.065
Finally, we're getting somewhere.

06:00.227 --> 06:05.460
- Ooh! Looks like he's kissing a corpse.
- Exactly. This is the best prank ever.

06:14.307 --> 06:15.137
Oh, my God.

06:15.307 --> 06:17.138
<i>- Oh, my God. Megan. Jesus Christ.
- Guys, what the hell?</i>

06:17.307 --> 06:18.706
<i>- Baby?
- Holy shit, you guys.</i>

06:18.867 --> 06:21.586
<i>- We got to do something.
- Baby, are you okay? Jesus Christ.</i>

06:21.747 --> 06:23.146
- Jesus!
- Let's go!

06:23.387 --> 06:24.456
My God.

06:26.907 --> 06:27.896
You guys...

06:28.067 --> 06:30.183
She's convulsing and there's
shit coming out of her mouth.

06:30.347 --> 06:31.541
- What?
- Yeah, I don't...

06:31.707 --> 06:32.856
What the fuck did you do?

06:33.027 --> 06:34.506
I didn't do...
I slipped her the pills you gave me.

06:34.667 --> 06:35.941
I said give her one!

06:36.107 --> 06:36.983
- I didn't know!
- Guys!

06:37.147 --> 06:38.705
- She's not breathing.
- We have to clear her airway.

06:38.867 --> 06:39.777
Why doesn't somebody call an ambulance?

06:39.947 --> 06:41.062
There's no time. Here.

06:41.227 --> 06:43.058
Give me the keys. Get me the Escalade now!

06:43.227 --> 06:44.626
- I'm going.
- Claire! Hey!

06:44.787 --> 06:46.186
Yep. I'm on it.

06:51.587 --> 06:53.145
That is so hot.

06:53.307 --> 06:54.296
Chugs!

06:57.627 --> 06:58.776
What? No tongue?

06:58.947 --> 07:01.381
Easy there, Lezzie Lohan.
This is make-believe, remember?

07:01.547 --> 07:03.378
- What is going on?
- She's okay?

07:03.547 --> 07:07.142
No, I'm not okay. I have fake puke
all over my $800 silk sheets.

07:07.307 --> 07:08.342
What exactly is happening?

07:08.507 --> 07:10.225
- Garret cheated on me.
- Didn't you cheat on him first?

07:10.387 --> 07:13.584
Details! That little bitch boy
cheated on a Theta.

07:13.747 --> 07:15.897
You cheat on one Theta,
you cheat on every Theta.

07:16.067 --> 07:19.423
Also he says, "I love you,"
like, 15 times every time we do it.

07:19.587 --> 07:21.020
But Garret is Chugs' brother.

07:21.187 --> 07:24.145
My brother, who slipped my Theta sister
pills he thought were roofies.

07:24.307 --> 07:26.298
My brother who also rushed Tri Pi.

07:26.467 --> 07:28.503
Whose motto is, "We'll try any pie."

07:28.667 --> 07:30.259
That boy needs to be taught a lesson.

07:30.427 --> 07:32.065
So if they weren't roofies,
then what were they?

07:32.227 --> 07:33.216
Vitamin B-12.

07:33.387 --> 07:34.740
You know that helps prevent anemia?

07:34.907 --> 07:38.343
Too bad it doesn't prevent bulimia.
That's something Megan could actually use.

07:42.387 --> 07:43.661
Show time.

07:49.587 --> 07:51.657
I can't even tell if she's breathing or not.

07:51.827 --> 07:52.816
I think she's turning cold.

07:52.987 --> 07:54.818
Don't say that to me!
Don't tell me that!

07:54.987 --> 07:56.215
How far are we from the hospital?

07:56.387 --> 07:58.617
I don't know. I think I took a wrong turn.
I'm totally freaking out.

07:58.787 --> 08:00.584
- What!
- She's not gonna make it!

08:00.747 --> 08:02.624
Oh, my God, she's dead.
She really fucking died.

08:02.787 --> 08:04.857
She died and it's my fault.
I'm gonna go to fucking jail!

08:06.907 --> 08:08.499
Hey! Watch my car!

08:08.667 --> 08:11.181
Okay, you know what?
Everybody calm down. Garret, this is all...

08:11.347 --> 08:13.144
Oh, my God! She's really dead!

08:13.307 --> 08:16.697
I need help. I need help.
Chugs, I want to call Mom right now.

08:26.507 --> 08:27.542
Where are we going?

08:27.707 --> 08:29.698
Garret, we're gonna take care of this. Okay?

08:30.547 --> 08:32.059
- I'm gonna call for help.
- No, no, no!

08:32.227 --> 08:33.216
Hey, we all had...

08:33.386 --> 08:36.345
I'm calling the fucking cops.
You guys had nothing to do with this.

08:36.506 --> 08:38.418
Really? Who gave you the roofies?
Jessica did.

08:38.587 --> 08:40.339
And she died at a party
at our sorority house.

08:40.506 --> 08:42.543
They'll close down our chapter for sure.

08:43.067 --> 08:45.945
- Right, Ellie?
- Yeah. Any illicit drugs use on campus

08:46.107 --> 08:47.665
is an automatic
two-year chapter suspension.

08:47.827 --> 08:50.057
I don't care about that! She's dying!

08:54.227 --> 08:56.104
- There's no signal.
- Garret, look at me.

08:56.267 --> 08:59.657
Look at me. Look at me, all right?
Hey, you've got to look at me.

08:59.827 --> 09:02.785
- We can make all this go away.
- How?

09:03.267 --> 09:05.258
Trust me. I know a place.

09:06.107 --> 09:07.426
Okay. All right.

09:09.547 --> 09:10.582
Okay.

09:12.027 --> 09:13.426
Claire, turn up here.

09:46.427 --> 09:48.338
Get on the ground. Shh.

09:48.947 --> 09:51.177
Garret, there's a blanket in the back. Get it.

09:54.547 --> 09:56.265
I guess I'll get it.

10:11.107 --> 10:12.699
What's happening? I can't see.

10:12.867 --> 10:14.619
Shh. You're dead, dummy.

10:15.387 --> 10:17.423
So the only thing to settle on is the body.

10:17.587 --> 10:21.466
Do we wrap it in the blanket as it is,
or do we chop it into little pieces first?

10:21.627 --> 10:25.540
Okay. Let's try not to leave our DNA
all over the place. Thank you.

10:26.387 --> 10:28.025
So, what's it gonna be?

10:28.187 --> 10:30.303
One big chunk or little bits and pieces?

10:30.467 --> 10:33.265
In premed, we learned that if there's air
in the lungs or the chest cavity

10:33.427 --> 10:34.655
the body will float to the surface.

10:34.827 --> 10:37.500
Yeah, she's right. We can't have her body
floating to the top.

10:37.667 --> 10:38.782
Yeah. Somebody will find her.

10:38.947 --> 10:41.222
What about those implants?
Does silicone float?

10:44.227 --> 10:47.583
All right. Everybody spread out and find
sharp rocks to dismember the body with.

11:10.507 --> 11:12.737
So how long
are you gonna keep this going?

11:13.867 --> 11:15.425
Yeah, I mean I kind of agree
with Cass.

11:15.587 --> 11:17.259
This is funny and all, but...

11:18.627 --> 11:21.266
You're right. That's why we're doing it.

11:22.267 --> 11:23.382
Because it's funny.

11:29.027 --> 11:29.903
Oh, my God!

11:30.067 --> 11:32.456
- There's no air in her lungs now.
- What the hell did you do?

11:32.627 --> 11:36.017
There's no air in her lungs now.
There's no air in her lungs now.

11:37.147 --> 11:39.741
- Oh, my God, what did you do?
- You mean, she wasn't dead?

11:40.787 --> 11:41.902
Shut the fuck up!

11:42.067 --> 11:44.103
Ellie! Ellie! Help me stop the bleeding.

11:44.907 --> 11:46.135
Start on her.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.499
Oh, my God, Megan!

11:50.587 --> 11:51.702
Oh, my God!

11:51.867 --> 11:53.186
Oh, my God!

11:58.427 --> 12:00.019
Somebody call 911.

12:03.827 --> 12:04.942
God!

12:08.307 --> 12:09.899
I don't have any reception!

12:10.387 --> 12:11.615
Anyone?

12:12.067 --> 12:13.546
We can't move her!

12:16.387 --> 12:17.661
Come on, Megan!

12:36.067 --> 12:38.456
Somebody get in the car
and drive until you get a signal.

12:38.627 --> 12:40.140
Wait, no. Wait, you guys.

12:41.267 --> 12:42.143
She's dead.

12:42.307 --> 12:44.457
- No, no, no.
- Cassidy, look at her. She's dead.

12:44.627 --> 12:46.379
She couldn't be more dead.

12:54.067 --> 12:55.739
What are we gonna do?

13:00.827 --> 13:02.783
We need to talk about this for a minute.

13:02.947 --> 13:04.858
Do you want to put her
in the car and go back?

13:05.027 --> 13:06.346
We could.

13:06.507 --> 13:10.580
Maybe. But we all need to be prepared
with what comes with that.

13:10.747 --> 13:11.862
What does that mean?

13:12.027 --> 13:15.178
Well, maybe we should call
our parents first.

13:15.347 --> 13:16.905
I mean, Megan's dead.

13:17.587 --> 13:22.058
And we're all responsible,
so we're gonna need lawyers.

13:22.227 --> 13:23.182
But Garret did it.

13:23.347 --> 13:26.384
Yes, and Garret will be going to jail,
but we are all just as responsible.

13:26.547 --> 13:29.698
Garret? I am not letting my little brother go
to jail for a stupid prank! No way!

13:29.867 --> 13:31.664
What, do you want to leave Megan
out here?

13:31.827 --> 13:32.657
Why not?

13:32.827 --> 13:34.419
I mean, everything we said a minute ago
is still true.

13:34.587 --> 13:35.940
Nobody knows we're here except us.

13:36.107 --> 13:38.826
- That's true.
- Oh, my God, you can't be serious.

13:38.987 --> 13:41.296
- She's our sister.
- That's also true.

13:41.627 --> 13:45.540
Megan was our sister. And we loved her.

13:45.867 --> 13:48.904
But I also know that Megan loved us.

13:49.667 --> 13:51.066
And Theta Pi.

13:51.907 --> 13:54.057
Would she want us to go down like this?

13:54.987 --> 13:57.979
Throw away our lives
and destroy the people we love?

13:59.107 --> 14:02.019
Yes, Claire. Didn't your dad have
a heart attack last year?

14:02.187 --> 14:04.018
Enough, Jessica.
I know what you're trying to do.

14:04.187 --> 14:05.540
What am I trying to do?

14:05.707 --> 14:08.460
I'm trying to make the best
out of a tragic situation.

14:08.627 --> 14:10.140
You're the one who suggested
we just leave her out here.

14:10.307 --> 14:12.775
No, I did not, and you know that!
There's right and there's wrong.

14:12.947 --> 14:14.938
I agree. But it's also wrong

14:15.107 --> 14:18.986
to destroy the lives of our families
for mistakes that we have made.

14:19.147 --> 14:22.025
All I can see is my father's face
when he hears all this.

14:22.427 --> 14:23.621
It'll kill him.

14:23.787 --> 14:25.937
Jessica doesn't care about
your father, Claire.

14:26.107 --> 14:28.257
The only thing she cares about is herself.

14:28.427 --> 14:31.737
Think about it. If this gets out,
Kyle's daddy won't let him be with her,

14:31.907 --> 14:33.545
because a killer in the family
doesn't look very good

14:33.707 --> 14:35.140
when you're running for Senate.

14:35.307 --> 14:37.059
What about your Mr. Perfect?

14:37.227 --> 14:38.580
You really think
Andy's gonna stay with you after this?

14:38.747 --> 14:40.419
This has nothing to do with him.

14:40.587 --> 14:43.306
This decision affects the rest of our lives!

14:43.467 --> 14:46.379
All right? Every job.
Every relationship we ever have.

14:46.547 --> 14:47.980
People will know.

14:49.107 --> 14:51.462
Shit! What the fuck
did you guys make me do, man?

14:51.627 --> 14:52.980
This is fucked!

14:56.067 --> 14:57.022
Maybe we should vote on it.

14:57.187 --> 15:01.305
What? I cannot believe my ears. What
happened to the tenets of sisterhood?

15:01.467 --> 15:03.378
Trust, honor, respect.

15:03.747 --> 15:05.339
Well, you forgot two.

15:06.627 --> 15:08.504
Secrecy and solidarity.

15:09.747 --> 15:12.261
There is a dead person here.
A girl that we murdered.

15:12.427 --> 15:13.576
Accidentally!

15:13.747 --> 15:14.862
Listen to yourself. All of you.

15:15.027 --> 15:18.064
This is not something you just sweep
under the rug or choose to forget.

15:18.227 --> 15:19.660
You have to live with this forever!

15:19.827 --> 15:21.579
I completely agree, Cassidy.

15:23.747 --> 15:27.456
I'm just trying to figure out
how we're going to live with it.

15:33.947 --> 15:35.380
I can't help but think

15:35.547 --> 15:38.505
what I would want if I were lying
where Megan is now.

15:39.867 --> 15:41.823
I could tell you what I wouldn't want.

15:42.667 --> 15:44.942
I wouldn't want you guys
to throw away your lives

15:45.107 --> 15:48.224
over something that cannot be changed.

15:50.067 --> 15:53.377
Because that's how much I love
each and every one of you.

15:57.867 --> 15:59.095
Shall we vote?

15:59.267 --> 16:02.179
Vote all you want.
Ellie and I know the truth. Right, Ellie?

16:04.587 --> 16:05.736
Ellie?

16:09.827 --> 16:13.103
Look, Cass. Everything you said was right.

16:14.627 --> 16:18.586
You're stronger than me, okay?
And you guys aren't on scholarship.

16:19.947 --> 16:20.936
I don't see a way out of this.

16:21.107 --> 16:22.745
There is no way out of this.

16:22.907 --> 16:26.183
Well, maybe there is.

16:30.227 --> 16:32.866
Oh, my God,
have you lost your fucking mind?

16:36.067 --> 16:38.422
I'm gonna make this very easy on all of you.

16:41.187 --> 16:44.782
Forget her. You guys, the last time
we saw Megan was at the party.

16:45.227 --> 16:48.299
She disappeared.
And we never saw her again.

16:49.147 --> 16:50.102
Okay?

16:50.267 --> 16:53.065
If we all stick to the same story,
no one will ever know, right?

16:53.227 --> 16:55.183
You guys can say
whatever the hell you want to say.

16:55.347 --> 16:56.302
No.

16:56.947 --> 16:59.700
You're gonna say
what we tell you to say. Okay?

17:00.587 --> 17:02.339
Are you gonna kill me, too?

17:05.827 --> 17:06.816
Cass, we can't let you do that.

17:06.987 --> 17:08.136
No. Let her go. It doesn't matter.

17:08.307 --> 17:10.457
She's gonna have to walk for three miles
before she gets any reception.

17:10.627 --> 17:12.583
But now, later, if she tells the cops,
goodbye, life.

17:12.747 --> 17:15.261
Come on, you guys. We have no choice.

17:16.666 --> 17:18.099
Come on, help me lift her.

17:23.387 --> 17:24.819
Come on. Come on.

17:56.347 --> 17:57.382
Ready?

18:02.507 --> 18:05.226
- Ready? One, two...
- Wait!

18:07.667 --> 18:11.023
What if this is a mistake?
I mean, if we cross this line...

18:11.187 --> 18:13.542
Look at the hole in her chest, Ellie.
The line's already been crossed.

18:13.707 --> 18:14.776
Three.

18:21.227 --> 18:23.183
You guys, I still can't get a signal.

18:27.627 --> 18:28.776
Where is she?

18:30.987 --> 18:33.421
Don't worry. At least she'll be warm, Cass.

18:33.587 --> 18:35.817
We wrapped her up
in your bloody jacket first.

18:36.587 --> 18:37.815
Oh, my God.

18:42.747 --> 18:45.978
And we all agreed.
We won't tell anyone what you did.

18:46.867 --> 18:49.779
- What I did?
- How you killed Megan with the tire iron.

18:50.787 --> 18:53.142
We're sisters. We'll protect you.

18:53.507 --> 18:54.906
You can count on us.

18:55.067 --> 18:59.697
Trust, respect, honor,
secrecy and solidarity.

19:01.427 --> 19:02.416
You wouldn't.

19:02.587 --> 19:06.421
We did. We're not gonna let this
ruin our lives, Cassidy.

19:06.867 --> 19:08.539
And there's no reason you have to, either.

19:08.707 --> 19:11.460
You guys, it is not that simple.
You can't do this, okay?

19:11.627 --> 19:13.424
Do you know what it's like
to live with a secret like this?

19:13.587 --> 19:14.815
Of course we do.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.386
We're Theta Pi.

19:17.347 --> 19:20.862
Now let's go wash the blood off in the lake.
And get back to the party.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.304
We knew you'd come around, Cass.

19:39.507 --> 19:40.940
Thank you, Cassidy.

19:42.147 --> 19:43.375
Come on.

20:07.507 --> 20:09.259
<i>As I stand
here with you today,</i>

20:09.427 --> 20:11.622
<i>I'm reminded of one of my favorite quotes.</i>

20:11.787 --> 20:14.585
<i>"Reputation comes
from the company you keep. "</i>

20:15.387 --> 20:19.426
<i>Well, thanks to you all,
the company I've kept these past four years</i>

20:19.907 --> 20:23.616
<i>has provided me with a reputation
I will always be proud of.</i>

20:23.787 --> 20:25.505
<i>Congratulations, graduates.</i>

20:25.667 --> 20:27.259
<i>Good luck. And God bless.</i>

20:34.987 --> 20:38.218
To my sisters at Theta Pi,
not just for four years, but forever.

20:38.707 --> 20:41.904
- Congrats, ladies.
- Ellie, you drink like a girl.

20:42.627 --> 20:44.583
Ooh. That went up my nose.

20:44.827 --> 20:46.226
Here, Jess. Have a sip.

20:46.387 --> 20:48.139
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

20:53.867 --> 20:55.346
I'm gonna miss you guys.

20:56.747 --> 20:58.339
This is gonna be awful.

20:59.107 --> 21:00.017
So, let's skip it.

21:00.187 --> 21:02.178
We don't have to go to
some stupid luncheon.

21:02.347 --> 21:05.180
My mother is a legacy.
She wants to see the house.

21:05.347 --> 21:07.907
Think about the good side.
You live through tonight,

21:08.067 --> 21:10.535
then tomorrow, we drive down
to my parents' place

21:10.707 --> 21:12.698
and wake up to waves crashing
on the beach.

21:12.867 --> 21:14.983
Yeah, well, if I thought
we'd be waking up in the same bed,

21:15.147 --> 21:17.980
- maybe it would give me a thrill.
- My parents still think it's the '50s.

21:18.147 --> 21:22.026
Mmm-hmm. Did I mention that I know
some great hotels in the area?

21:26.187 --> 21:28.417
Hey, what happened to you
and your sisters, anyway?

21:29.147 --> 21:31.263
You were all so close,
then after Megan disappeared...

21:31.427 --> 21:32.940
Could we not talk about that?

21:34.547 --> 21:35.741
I keep hoping you'll change your mind.

21:35.907 --> 21:37.977
Can we please just talk about
something else?

21:38.467 --> 21:40.458
I just want you to know I'm here for you.

21:56.187 --> 21:57.859
I think you put this on wrong.

22:01.667 --> 22:04.625
And you definitely put this on wrong.

22:08.507 --> 22:10.941
Let me guess. I put these on wrong, too.

22:34.827 --> 22:36.180
I'm so excited.

22:37.307 --> 22:38.945
- It's so pretty.
- Wow. Look at this place.

22:39.107 --> 22:40.540
You'd almost think nice people lived here.

22:40.707 --> 22:41.856
Hey, be nice.

22:45.787 --> 22:47.505
And there's the devil herself.

22:49.307 --> 22:52.265
Mr. and Mrs. Tappan!
I haven't seen you in forever.

22:52.427 --> 22:53.780
Hi, Jessica.

22:53.947 --> 22:57.496
Well, well, well, if it isn't the boy
who has taken our little Cassidy away.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.464
She's a big girl.
She can make her own decisions.

22:59.627 --> 23:03.415
Careful. Don't you know? Earth and fire
can't break the bonds of Theta Pi.

23:03.587 --> 23:05.498
After all, we're sisters.

23:06.587 --> 23:07.861
Excuse me.

23:08.307 --> 23:10.218
So, where is everyone? Chugs?

23:10.627 --> 23:11.696
Chugs...

23:12.427 --> 23:13.303
Well, you know Chugs.

23:13.467 --> 23:16.903
She's always willing to help out
with a little freshman orientation.

23:21.587 --> 23:23.179
You taste like vomit.

23:23.587 --> 23:26.420
That's because I threw up before.
But I ate a mint, so you're fine.

23:29.147 --> 23:31.263
Oops! I forgot to wear underwear.

23:33.707 --> 23:35.743
And it's really cold down there.

23:38.347 --> 23:40.178
Maybe you could warm it up for me?

23:41.907 --> 23:43.863
This whole thing's kind of grossing me out.

23:45.627 --> 23:49.063
Whatever. Move it, loser.
Not my fault you're gay.

23:52.227 --> 23:55.981
This has been the best four years
of our lives.

23:56.347 --> 23:59.020
The best five years for some of us.
Not mentioning any names.

23:59.187 --> 24:00.302
Becky Reed.

24:02.187 --> 24:04.018
We have this luncheon every year

24:04.187 --> 24:06.985
to celebrate the long-lasting ties
of sisterhood.

24:07.427 --> 24:09.895
And to remember that our motto,

24:10.067 --> 24:15.585
"Trust, respect, honor,
secrecy and solidarity,"

24:15.747 --> 24:17.783
are truly words that last a lifetime.

24:17.947 --> 24:20.541
As you can see by looking
at the east wing of the house,

24:20.707 --> 24:22.584
renovations are getting underway.

24:23.027 --> 24:26.622
So the house, like our sisterhood,
will be stronger than ever.

24:27.187 --> 24:29.223
We have our beloved housemother to thank

24:29.387 --> 24:30.820
for all of her hard work
on getting this done.

24:30.987 --> 24:32.386
Thank you, Mrs. Crenshaw.

24:32.547 --> 24:33.696
Thank you.

24:44.227 --> 24:49.301
However, as happy as this day is,
there's still one whom we cannot forget.

24:50.507 --> 24:52.418
One of our sisters is still missing.

24:53.427 --> 24:58.057
And we hope and pray
that she will come back to us.

25:00.867 --> 25:01.936
To Megan.

25:03.627 --> 25:04.901
No frigging way.

25:05.147 --> 25:07.615
We love and miss you always.

25:14.107 --> 25:17.497
Well, as you can see, some of us
are still a little overwhelmed by it all.

25:24.987 --> 25:26.739
Okay, who up and faints anymore?

25:26.907 --> 25:28.022
It's okay. I told them it was the heat.

25:28.187 --> 25:30.826
- It was Megan. I know it was her.
- It was her sister, dumbass.

25:30.987 --> 25:33.057
And might I say, you played it real cool.

25:34.347 --> 25:38.545
Hi. I'm so sorry.
I did not mean to scare you, Ellie.

25:38.707 --> 25:39.822
How'd she know my name?

25:39.987 --> 25:44.026
I'm Maggie. I met you before.
All of you. When I was 15.

25:44.187 --> 25:47.259
Right. You're bigger. You've grown up.

25:49.547 --> 25:51.856
I decided I'm coming to Rosman next year.

25:52.547 --> 25:55.345
I think it's important for my sister.
You know, some closure.

25:55.507 --> 25:58.465
And I think it'd be good
for my parents, too, so...

25:58.627 --> 26:00.060
So, how are they doing?

26:00.227 --> 26:02.263
Okay. They couldn't come today.

26:02.827 --> 26:04.738
It's still way too hard.

26:05.347 --> 26:06.860
But I didn't want to miss it.

26:07.027 --> 26:10.337
Anyways, I just wanted to come by
and say hello

26:10.507 --> 26:13.704
and let you guys know that I'm gonna be
rushing Theta Pi next year.

26:13.867 --> 26:15.346
I'm gonna be sick.

26:17.507 --> 26:19.225
We'd be lucky to have you.

26:20.867 --> 26:23.700
Um, you guys having a party tonight?

26:23.867 --> 26:27.098
Yeah. Yeah. You know,
you should totally come.

26:27.267 --> 26:30.942
Wait, no, you're rushing next year
and that violates Greek rules of recruiting.

26:31.107 --> 26:33.667
Well, I won't tell if you guys won't.

26:34.987 --> 26:37.547
Well, we have to go.
Sorry about tonight, but I'll tell you what,

26:37.707 --> 26:40.540
I will personally see to your future
as a Theta Pi next year.

26:41.307 --> 26:42.296
- Okay.
- Okay.

26:42.467 --> 26:43.900
- Nice to meet you guys.
- You, too.

26:44.067 --> 26:46.183
Friend me on Facebook, I'll totally confirm.

26:47.187 --> 26:48.336
- Bye.
- Bye.

26:51.387 --> 26:53.582
Was it just me,
or was that girl all sorts of creepy.

26:53.747 --> 26:54.782
Can't imagine why.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.619
No way she's getting in with that outfit.

26:57.067 --> 26:58.739
Who is ready to party?

26:58.907 --> 27:00.784
That would be me.
That would be me.

27:02.507 --> 27:03.542
That's what I was looking for.

27:03.707 --> 27:04.662
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

27:04.827 --> 27:06.624
- Hi, you.
- Hi.

27:06.787 --> 27:08.698
Chugs, your mom? Smoking.

27:08.867 --> 27:10.380
I would definitely have
a sip of that MILF-shake.

27:10.547 --> 27:13.459
- Hey!
- If I wasn't dating you, of course, Claire.

27:13.627 --> 27:16.300
Okay, we have two hours
before this place is packed.

27:16.467 --> 27:18.185
I got to get to my shrink. Score some Oxys.

27:18.347 --> 27:21.020
Hey, you think if you blow him,
you can get enough for everyone?

27:21.187 --> 27:22.666
- Kyle, excuse me.
- What? I'm serious.

27:22.827 --> 27:26.297
I wish it were that painless. Unfortunately
for me, he's more of an ass man.

27:27.267 --> 27:30.464
Okay, you guys, it's on.
Tonight we bring the house down.

27:30.627 --> 27:31.537
That we do.

27:31.707 --> 27:33.698
Kyle, can you and Mickey
go get some decorations from the cellar?

27:33.867 --> 27:35.539
- Yeah. Let's do it.
- Yeah, we can do that.

27:35.707 --> 27:36.981
- Thanks. Bye.
- Bye.

27:37.307 --> 27:39.184
- You are so whipped.
- Speak for yourself, pretty boy.

27:40.427 --> 27:41.780
It's Ellie's.

27:50.987 --> 27:52.625
What? Oh, my God.

27:52.867 --> 27:54.698
- Who sent this?
- What the hell?

27:54.867 --> 27:56.698
- Oh, my God.
- Is this a joke?

27:56.867 --> 27:58.300
Garret! I'm gonna kill him.

27:58.467 --> 28:00.503
Garret? What the fuck is this, Chugs?

28:00.667 --> 28:02.180
It's a joke. It's a really bad joke.

28:02.347 --> 28:03.541
This is beyond sick.

28:03.707 --> 28:04.981
Okay. Why would Garret do this?

28:05.147 --> 28:08.059
I can think of a reason. He's gone psycho
and he wants to kill us all.

28:08.227 --> 28:09.546
Hey, he's not...

28:10.267 --> 28:14.545
Guys! Look, I know my brother.
Okay, yes, he's sort of

28:16.147 --> 28:19.264
lost his way, but I know him, okay? And...

28:20.027 --> 28:22.587
Look, he developed
this weird sense of humor

28:24.267 --> 28:26.303
since the accident,
and this is just his way of saying...

28:26.467 --> 28:28.856
Oh, happy graduation? That's real funny.

28:29.027 --> 28:30.016
What the hell are we gonna do?

28:30.187 --> 28:32.655
Nothing. That's why delete was invented.

28:32.827 --> 28:34.579
- Hey, guys.
- Delete it, Claire.

28:36.227 --> 28:39.537
So, now all we have to do
is get rid of Crenshaw

28:39.707 --> 28:41.425
and get this place ready for the party.

28:42.147 --> 28:45.378
Ellie, can you be in charge
with freshman cleaning up the place?

28:45.547 --> 28:47.026
If Cassidy helps me.

28:47.187 --> 28:48.700
I'm not...

28:48.867 --> 28:51.700
Please don't say you're not coming.
How is that gonna look?

28:51.867 --> 28:52.743
I don't care how it looks.

28:52.907 --> 28:55.137
To be honest, Jessica,
I don't really care if we get caught.

28:55.307 --> 28:57.263
I just don't want to share a cell with you.

28:58.147 --> 28:59.546
Don't act all holier than thou.

28:59.707 --> 29:01.982
You could have gone to the cops
if you really wanted to.

29:20.627 --> 29:22.106
- Hey.
- What you doing?

29:22.267 --> 29:23.586
Careful what you say, I just pinned you.

29:23.747 --> 29:26.022
Hey, I'm just updating my Facebook.
I just wrote,

29:26.187 --> 29:28.906
"Andy has just graduated
and can't wait to take his girl fishing."

29:29.067 --> 29:31.137
<i>I told you, I'll go to your parents,</i>

29:31.307 --> 29:34.140
if you and your dad catch the fish,
your mom cooks the fish and I eat the fish.

29:34.307 --> 29:36.377
<i>- It's not that complicated.
- Lazy! God!</i>

29:36.547 --> 29:38.139
<i>- Hey.
- To think, I was gonna ask</i>

29:38.307 --> 29:40.696
if you wanted to come to Europe with me
this summer.

29:41.507 --> 29:42.826
Look, Andy,

29:44.827 --> 29:46.579
there's some things
you really don't know about me.

29:46.747 --> 29:49.056
Hey, if it's the morning breath,
trust me, I know.

29:49.227 --> 29:50.865
No, I'm being serious.

29:51.027 --> 29:53.302
<i>I'll tell you everything tonight
on the way to your parents.</i>

29:53.467 --> 29:55.537
And I just have one more favor.

29:55.707 --> 29:57.743
I've kind of been sucked
into this thing at Theta.

29:57.907 --> 29:59.340
Would you mind coming with me
to the house

29:59.507 --> 30:01.384
just for the beginning of the party,
and then we can leave?

30:02.787 --> 30:04.903
<i>- Yeah. Anything for you.
- You're the best.</i>

30:06.467 --> 30:08.537
Really. You're the most wonderful thing
in my life.

30:08.707 --> 30:12.336
And I'd do anything for you.

30:12.627 --> 30:15.095
Really? Well, we'll test that theory tonight.

30:16.267 --> 30:18.906
- Okay, I'll see you in an hour.
- Cool. Bye.

30:26.227 --> 30:28.582
Okay, ladies,
I know the rules.

30:28.907 --> 30:32.820
You get the house to yourself
the last night you spend in Theta Pi.

30:32.987 --> 30:35.296
And I trust that you will show this place

30:35.467 --> 30:39.506
the same respect
that you've shown me the past four years.

30:40.267 --> 30:42.019
- Of course.
- That was a joke.

30:43.547 --> 30:45.902
Now I know that during your time here,

30:46.067 --> 30:48.342
I was forced to give most of you
a write-up or two.

30:48.507 --> 30:51.783
But trust me, for every boy
that I threw out of here,

30:51.947 --> 30:55.496
there were five times I knew about it
and didn't say one thing.

30:55.667 --> 30:59.819
And sometimes there were five boys
in one night. Right, Chugs?

31:00.147 --> 31:02.502
I have a lot of areas that need attention.
I don't know.

31:02.667 --> 31:03.543
- Slut!
- What are you looking at?

31:03.707 --> 31:07.256
Anyway, I hope, as you girls prepare
to go out into the world,

31:07.427 --> 31:10.624
that the things that you've learned
here in Theta Pi

31:10.787 --> 31:14.462
will always help to guide you
to do the right thing.

31:14.627 --> 31:17.664
And now, to make sure
you don't forget me or each other,

31:17.827 --> 31:19.180
a little gift.

31:21.627 --> 31:23.583
I'm sorry. It's really nice.

31:25.987 --> 31:28.421
There are 22 links in each chain.

31:28.587 --> 31:31.385
One for every graduating Theta Pi senior.

31:31.547 --> 31:34.141
When you wear these bracelets,
you will always remember

31:34.307 --> 31:37.060
just how strong the bonds
of sisterhood are.

31:37.227 --> 31:39.582
- Thank you.
- Please!

31:39.747 --> 31:42.261
Okay, I'm out of here.

31:42.747 --> 31:45.181
- You girls behave yourselves.
- We will.

31:45.507 --> 31:47.657
Well, screw it. That'll never happen.

31:48.387 --> 31:51.663
Just make sure you don't hurt yourselves
or the house. All right?

31:51.827 --> 31:53.146
- No problem, Mrs. Crenshaw.
- All right.

31:53.307 --> 31:54.660
- Thank you, Mrs. Crenshaw.
- Bye, girls!

31:54.827 --> 31:56.499
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

31:57.507 --> 32:00.658
What is this? Silver-coated?
I'm never gonna wear this.

32:01.427 --> 32:03.145
Excuse me. Move, bitches.

32:03.307 --> 32:04.865
Jess, wait up. Give me a hug.

32:06.747 --> 32:08.339
- Bye, Mrs. Crenshaw.
- Bye.

32:24.827 --> 32:28.217
<i>Seconds to your elevator
from the station</i>

32:28.747 --> 32:32.057
<i>How can I resist that kind of invitation?</i>

32:32.627 --> 32:35.266
Come on, chicken.
One last time in the hot tub?

32:35.427 --> 32:40.376
You're crazy, there's people all around.
I say we just head upstairs, huh?

32:42.067 --> 32:43.136
What have you got there, Claire?

32:43.307 --> 32:45.502
I don't think the bubble bath
will be good for the jets.

32:50.467 --> 32:52.219
No, not the boobies.

32:53.507 --> 32:54.576
So...

32:56.547 --> 32:57.582
Okay.

32:58.667 --> 32:59.861
I'm gonna do it.

33:17.227 --> 33:18.580
Dr. Rosenberg?

33:23.227 --> 33:24.580
Anybody home?

33:32.187 --> 33:33.415
Hello?

33:51.587 --> 33:53.020
Dr. Rosenberg?

34:00.267 --> 34:01.382
Hello?

34:03.787 --> 34:05.015
Dr. Rosenberg?

34:08.867 --> 34:11.665
Doc? I'm here for my 5:00.

34:25.987 --> 34:27.022
Dr. Rosenberg!

34:27.187 --> 34:32.819
Hi. Sorry about this.
The last session ended abruptly.

34:32.987 --> 34:34.420
Where are the keys?

34:35.587 --> 34:37.259
They're on the... Hey.

34:38.067 --> 34:41.742
There's no reason you and I can't finish
what my last patient started.

34:43.627 --> 34:46.016
Have I mentioned
all the sample prescriptions I have

34:46.187 --> 34:47.620
with no place to go?

34:50.667 --> 34:53.135
Okay. I'm gonna go freshen up.

35:13.547 --> 35:16.778
Excuse me.
You have to schedule an appointment.

35:36.907 --> 35:38.818
Hey, Jess, it's me. Look,

35:39.227 --> 35:41.343
I'm not gonna make it back
until after the party starts

35:41.507 --> 35:45.102
'cause Dr. Rosenberg's really making me
earn the pills this time.

35:45.747 --> 35:47.180
But I'll see you later? Bye.

36:10.867 --> 36:12.266
Cheers, slut.

36:22.067 --> 36:23.182
Really?

36:28.187 --> 36:29.415
Hello?

36:36.787 --> 36:39.062
I don't have time for "Catch Me, Rape Me."

37:17.307 --> 37:19.662
Theta Pi, bitches!

37:20.947 --> 37:23.336
Guys, it's 6:00 and I'm already wasted.

37:23.507 --> 37:25.623
Yeah, and by 10:00, she'll be pregnant.

37:40.067 --> 37:41.056
Okay.

37:48.027 --> 37:49.346
Senator Tyson.

37:50.507 --> 37:52.304
It is so nice to see you.

37:52.467 --> 37:54.617
I apologize. I wasn't able
to make your luncheon.

37:54.787 --> 37:56.937
I just flew in
from a Commerce Committee meeting.

37:57.107 --> 37:58.506
That's no problem.

38:03.467 --> 38:05.617
- Where's Kyle?
- He'll be along.

38:05.787 --> 38:09.746
This is nice for us. Gives us a chance
to talk. Sort out a few things.

38:10.147 --> 38:11.216
Thank you.

38:13.747 --> 38:15.260
Jessica, may I be frank?

38:16.907 --> 38:18.738
You are a spirited girl.

38:19.387 --> 38:20.581
Oh, thank you, sir.

38:21.227 --> 38:22.899
I didn't mean that as a compliment.

38:23.507 --> 38:24.542
As I'm sure you've heard,

38:24.707 --> 38:27.858
there are rumblings I might get
a vice presidential nod.

38:28.307 --> 38:29.376
Yes, sir.

38:29.747 --> 38:33.103
In my experience,
there are two kinds of girls in this world.

38:33.267 --> 38:37.260
The ones you spend your life with
and the ones you burn hard with.

38:38.027 --> 38:40.587
Problem is that I'm not sure
what kind you are.

38:40.747 --> 38:43.705
But I am sure that Kyle wants
to spend his life with you.

38:44.667 --> 38:49.263
Sir, I've been dreaming my whole life
to marry someone like Kyle.

38:49.427 --> 38:50.985
I don't like surprises.

38:52.227 --> 38:53.376
Okay.

38:53.547 --> 38:56.778
When I pick up a book,
the first thing I do is read the last page.

38:58.027 --> 39:01.815
I'll be watching you, Jessica.
Don't give me any surprises.

39:01.987 --> 39:04.945
Otherwise this dream
you've had your whole life, well,

39:05.427 --> 39:06.985
it all goes away.

39:08.587 --> 39:11.943
Senator Tyson, I won't disappoint you.

39:12.587 --> 39:15.340
I know you won't. I know you won't.

39:15.947 --> 39:17.141
I'm sorry.

39:18.627 --> 39:21.619
I am so sorry.
I was riding my bike and I got a flat.

39:21.787 --> 39:23.140
Yeah. Well, nothing to worry about, son.

39:23.307 --> 39:26.379
Your charming young lady
and I were just catching up.

39:27.147 --> 39:28.978
She is a charmer, isn't she?

39:40.547 --> 39:42.663
Looks like someone's been hard at work.

39:44.467 --> 39:45.343
- Hey.
- Yeah.

39:45.507 --> 39:46.622
Could you put your eyes back in your head?

39:46.787 --> 39:48.379
- At least until I leave the room?
- Sure can.

39:48.547 --> 39:49.662
Thanks.

39:51.427 --> 39:53.338
Seriously, dude, the party starts in an hour.

39:53.507 --> 39:54.735
- Go get ready!
- I'm going!

39:54.907 --> 39:57.182
Okay. Good. Bye.

39:57.907 --> 39:59.135
Are you gonna be all right?

39:59.307 --> 40:00.740
Sure. Why wouldn't I be all right?

40:00.907 --> 40:04.946
I'm good, Cass. Just let me help clean up.
That goes in the basement. I'll take it down.

40:10.667 --> 40:11.941
That's tacky.

40:13.147 --> 40:14.865
- I'm worried about her.
- Who?

40:15.187 --> 40:18.623
Ellie. What is gonna happen to her
when she leaves this place?

40:18.787 --> 40:19.822
What do I care?

40:19.987 --> 40:21.898
I don't need her to do my term papers
for me anymore.

40:22.067 --> 40:25.503
Jessica, I think that we have different
definitions of the word "sister."

40:26.747 --> 40:29.307
I'm gonna go take a shower.
That's not an invitation.

40:46.267 --> 40:48.827
Wow. Yoga is working wonders
on your ass.

41:33.227 --> 41:35.457
<i>Sorry. Didn't know this was ocupado.</i>

41:36.027 --> 41:38.541
FYI, waxing isn't just for floors anymore.

41:41.147 --> 41:42.216
Riley?

41:42.707 --> 41:43.742
Are you a senior?

41:43.907 --> 41:46.137
Because last time I checked,
this was a senior bathroom.

41:46.867 --> 41:48.425
Do I have to start checking stalls again?

41:48.587 --> 41:49.622
Fuck.

41:50.267 --> 41:51.541
No, I didn't think so.

41:52.347 --> 41:53.541
You can leave now.

41:54.467 --> 41:56.822
Actually. Wait. Drop your towel first.

41:58.467 --> 41:59.456
My room's on the other side of the...

41:59.627 --> 42:01.618
Without rules, there would be chaos.

42:02.907 --> 42:06.422
Fine. But if you wanted to see perfect tits,
all you had to do was ask.

42:11.747 --> 42:12.816
What?

42:17.747 --> 42:19.624
I keep thinking about that text.

42:19.947 --> 42:21.096
Claire...

42:22.587 --> 42:26.182
Garret is a little bitch.
He says we made him kill Megan?

42:26.347 --> 42:27.416
As if.

42:27.587 --> 42:29.498
Seriously, Claire, grow a pair.

42:29.987 --> 42:32.057
Jessica, I've always had your back.

42:32.227 --> 42:34.183
But you've never had a backbone.

43:07.187 --> 43:08.302
Hello?

43:32.627 --> 43:33.776
Hello?

44:20.147 --> 44:22.536
Hey, Ellie,
see if there's more vodka down there.

44:22.707 --> 44:23.822
Okay.

44:44.387 --> 44:46.184
Okay, more vodka.

44:49.067 --> 44:50.102
Hello?

44:54.227 --> 44:55.455
Anybody there?

44:58.707 --> 45:00.743
Where the hell
would they keep more vodka?

45:10.427 --> 45:12.497
No. No.

45:13.347 --> 45:15.907
Damn it! Shit.

45:18.747 --> 45:20.385
Oh, this is really dumb.

45:25.627 --> 45:28.141
"Here lies Ellie Morris,
and she never got laid."

45:59.347 --> 46:01.099
Ellie. Whoa.

46:02.067 --> 46:03.182
You all right?

46:05.107 --> 46:07.462
What are you...
What are you doing down here?

46:07.627 --> 46:09.185
I'm looking for you.

46:10.227 --> 46:12.377
Cassidy said you might need some help.

46:17.587 --> 46:19.623
We killed her, you guys.
Don't you understand that?

46:19.787 --> 46:21.743
We dumped her body down a mineshaft!

46:21.907 --> 46:22.942
- Why can't you understand that?
- Hey, Ellie,

46:23.107 --> 46:24.699
there are 30 other girls behind that door

46:24.867 --> 46:27.222
that probably shouldn't know
we murdered our sorority sister, okay?

46:27.387 --> 46:28.661
This isn't happening. It's not possible.

46:28.827 --> 46:30.863
Okay, seriously, everyone just relax

46:31.027 --> 46:33.746
- for two seconds.
- Relax? The last time I saw that jacket,

46:33.907 --> 46:36.262
you wrapped it around a dead body
and dropped it down a mineshaft.

46:36.427 --> 46:38.065
- Where's the rest of it?
- It's a prank.

46:38.227 --> 46:40.821
It's the only explanation. It's...
Somebody's playing a prank.

46:40.987 --> 46:43.660
Yeah, or maybe Megan came back
from the dead and she wants to kill us.

46:43.827 --> 46:44.896
- How about that?
- No, listen.

46:45.067 --> 46:47.262
Ellie, we didn't want to tell you,
but we got a text message earlier

46:47.427 --> 46:49.816
and we think that this is Garret
playing a sick joke on us.

46:49.987 --> 46:51.705
- Garret?
- Yes.

46:51.867 --> 46:52.982
He came back?

46:53.147 --> 46:56.696
He's gone psycho. He's left the compound.
Where the hell is Chugs, anyway?

46:56.867 --> 46:58.539
She left me a message.
She'll be here when the party starts.

46:58.707 --> 47:02.222
The party's already started!
I'm sorry, but it has.

47:02.387 --> 47:04.696
We all deserve to die.

47:04.867 --> 47:06.459
<i>HI, It's Chugs. Leave a message after the...</i>

47:07.707 --> 47:09.857
Chugs, we need to know where
your brother is and we need to know now.

47:10.027 --> 47:12.621
Please, call back whenever you get this.

47:13.987 --> 47:17.536
- We're dead. We're so dead.
- Nobody is dead, Ellie.

47:17.707 --> 47:18.856
Well, Megan.

47:19.027 --> 47:22.178
This is Garret. Garret is harmless.
That's not the problem.

47:22.347 --> 47:25.862
- Then what is the problem?
- Well, Garret's gone nuts!

47:26.027 --> 47:29.463
Guys, if he blabs,
that's orange jumpsuits for all of us.

47:29.627 --> 47:30.537
What do we do?

47:30.707 --> 47:32.425
- We're calling the police.
- No.

47:32.587 --> 47:34.862
We stick together. Above all else.

47:35.027 --> 47:37.495
Why is it that the only time
you want to stick together

47:37.667 --> 47:39.976
- is when your ass is on the line?
- And we wait for Chugs

47:40.147 --> 47:41.819
to put a pin in her brother.

47:41.987 --> 47:46.026
But for now,
let's get ready and go downstairs

47:46.187 --> 47:48.178
- and enjoy the party.
- Like that's gonna happen.

47:48.347 --> 47:49.621
If we do not go to our own party,

47:49.787 --> 47:52.859
we might as well magic-marker "guilty"
across our foreheads.

47:53.027 --> 47:55.825
And if anybody sees Garret,
come get me, I will deal with him.

47:55.987 --> 47:58.421
But what about the jacket?

47:58.587 --> 48:00.066
Hide it, Ellie.

48:38.347 --> 48:39.575
Help yourself.

48:40.987 --> 48:43.296
Yeah, I can see this ending well.

49:38.587 --> 49:39.906
Boo!

49:45.307 --> 49:47.696
Oh, my God, I so want to be anywhere
but here right now.

49:47.867 --> 49:51.177
- You're not alone.
- I promise we'll leave soon.

49:56.707 --> 49:57.856
Get off.

50:08.187 --> 50:09.540
Are you deaf or stupid?

50:09.707 --> 50:12.699
Claire, what is your problem?
All right? Relax. Come on.

50:12.867 --> 50:15.222
I just don't want you grinding
all your business all over me.

50:15.387 --> 50:18.220
Yeah? Well, you didn't seem
to mind my business today in the hot tub.

50:18.387 --> 50:19.502
You know, Mickey,

50:19.667 --> 50:22.181
it'd be really nice to have someone
who cared enough to read a situation.

50:22.347 --> 50:24.258
The situation is that
it's the last night of college, all right?

50:24.427 --> 50:27.737
I could catch action off
any of these girls. All right?

50:28.227 --> 50:29.546
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

50:30.347 --> 50:32.941
Well, catch this action, asshole.

50:50.227 --> 50:53.264
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

50:54.867 --> 50:56.266
I'm a sea pig!

51:08.547 --> 51:09.582
Dick!

51:21.747 --> 51:24.136
Hey, sweetie. How are you?

51:27.347 --> 51:28.985
So me and Claire just broke up.

51:29.147 --> 51:32.901
She hit me. Can you believe it?
It's ridiculous.

51:34.147 --> 51:38.106
But you, you look really pretty tonight.
I wanted to tell you that.

51:38.627 --> 51:40.538
Really nice. I like this.

51:42.467 --> 51:45.027
The whole braid thing you got going.

51:47.427 --> 51:51.056
Mickey? If you touch me again,
I'll fucking kill you.

51:52.507 --> 51:54.304
Okay. We'll talk later.

52:00.387 --> 52:01.900
- Come on, I'll push you up. Go.
- Okay.

52:02.827 --> 52:03.737
I can't...

52:03.907 --> 52:07.695
Ladies? Girls. I think I know what you want.

52:10.587 --> 52:12.703
Show a little skin, you're in.

52:14.387 --> 52:15.422
Hmm?

52:16.067 --> 52:18.661
Step into my office. Do excuse the mess.

52:24.107 --> 52:26.416
Just one flash. That's it.

52:26.587 --> 52:28.179
That's negotiable.

52:30.067 --> 52:31.466
What was that?

52:31.627 --> 52:34.346
Ladies? Stay. Okay? I got the passes.

52:37.947 --> 52:39.062
Hello?

52:41.467 --> 52:43.742
Buddy, you graduated. That's awesome.

52:43.907 --> 52:45.704
We're all real impressed.

52:45.867 --> 52:47.505
- However, you're blocking...
- Hey!

52:47.667 --> 52:48.986
- Yeah?
- We're gonna pass.

52:49.147 --> 52:51.581
- No. You're not gonna pass.
- No, you're just a little too creepy.

52:51.747 --> 52:55.376
- Yeah. And you're not real hot, either.
- That's not very nice.

52:55.867 --> 52:58.859
Hey, thanks a lot, buddy.

53:00.467 --> 53:01.582
Ladies?

53:04.187 --> 53:06.655
Ellie? Hey, we were just messing around.

53:06.827 --> 53:09.421
It's nothing worth talking to Claire about.

53:09.587 --> 53:11.464
Right, Ellie? Ellie!

53:11.627 --> 53:14.141
You're better off
without him, Claire.

53:19.467 --> 53:21.503
I'm really glad you stayed.

53:23.827 --> 53:26.216
Cass, I want you to know that

53:26.387 --> 53:30.300
I think it's great
that you've turned into a better person.

53:30.467 --> 53:33.265
I have not become a better person.
I'm far from it.

53:33.427 --> 53:36.464
No, I mean, with the charity work

53:36.627 --> 53:40.700
and all the other stuff you've done
and getting away from this place.

53:42.987 --> 53:43.976
I...

53:45.507 --> 53:49.819
We made a huge mistake
not going to the cops.

53:51.787 --> 53:53.186
Yeah, we made

53:54.747 --> 53:57.136
a string of bad choices that night.

53:57.827 --> 53:59.977
And right now there's not much
we can do about it.

54:00.147 --> 54:02.058
We are sisters.

54:02.227 --> 54:06.857
And right now all we can do
is stick together and get through this thing.

54:07.587 --> 54:08.622
Yeah.

54:11.587 --> 54:12.656
Yeah.

54:13.587 --> 54:14.702
Ellie?

54:19.907 --> 54:21.022
Ellie?

54:22.067 --> 54:23.580
Are you up here?

54:26.907 --> 54:31.219
All right, look, I... I can admit
I've been kind of a jerk, all right?

54:31.387 --> 54:37.462
But I promise if you come out,
I'll apologize and we can

54:38.707 --> 54:40.265
kiss and make up.

54:43.787 --> 54:45.379
What are you doing?

54:45.547 --> 54:47.265
Who the fuck are you?

55:00.267 --> 55:02.576
Please! Help me!

55:07.627 --> 55:09.902
Please! Help me! Help me, please!

55:12.147 --> 55:14.661
That dude's fucking wasted.

55:14.827 --> 55:16.260
Please help me!

55:17.387 --> 55:18.945
Why are you doing this to me?

55:19.107 --> 55:21.621
Help me! Help me! Help!

55:36.467 --> 55:38.583
Why are you doing this to me?

55:39.707 --> 55:41.106
Oh, my God!

55:47.427 --> 55:51.625
Help! Help! Oh, my God!

55:51.787 --> 55:55.780
Help me! I need help! Help!

56:12.627 --> 56:15.016
I think you need some more mascara.

56:16.427 --> 56:18.987
- Yeah, I do. Thanks.
- Yeah.

56:20.627 --> 56:22.822
Oh, God, Ellie's falling apart.

56:22.987 --> 56:24.181
What now?

56:35.947 --> 56:37.460
Excuse me, honey.

56:37.627 --> 56:38.821
Is everything okay?

56:38.987 --> 56:42.104
Yeah. Ellie's just freaking out. As usual.

56:44.307 --> 56:46.457
I thought you said you had everything
under control.

56:46.627 --> 56:47.662
I do.

56:50.387 --> 56:51.661
You better.

56:56.627 --> 56:58.697
Ellie? You okay?

56:58.867 --> 57:02.382
- What? What now, Ellie?
- Enough! Shh!

57:04.147 --> 57:07.264
Okay, we don't have time for this.
Just... First word?

57:07.427 --> 57:08.826
First syllable?

57:08.987 --> 57:11.865
- Okay, go!
- He was wearing a hooded graduation...

57:12.027 --> 57:13.380
Somebody in a graduation gown?

57:13.547 --> 57:16.937
A hooded graduation gown?
Ellie, it's Graduation Day.

57:17.107 --> 57:19.575
Half the Greek system is
in hooded graduation gowns right now.

57:19.747 --> 57:21.146
Did he have two eyes?
Did he have two ears?

57:21.307 --> 57:22.865
Okay, stop! Jessica, stop.

57:23.027 --> 57:24.745
- What?
- Let her talk.

57:26.587 --> 57:28.259
He... He...

57:32.867 --> 57:35.301
Okay, if you can't tell us,
you're going to show us.

57:35.467 --> 57:36.695
- No! Please! No!
- Okay.

57:36.867 --> 57:38.903
- We'll go together. We'll go together.
- Ellie!

57:39.787 --> 57:42.460
- No!
- Can't we just leave her?

57:43.707 --> 57:45.459
You guys go ahead.
I'm gonna stay with her.

57:45.627 --> 57:46.662
Good.

57:54.547 --> 57:56.663
This is stupid.
We're missing the party of the year.

57:56.827 --> 57:59.625
I know. Why couldn't Ellie
have had a nervous breakdown tomorrow?

57:59.787 --> 58:03.336
You know, Cassidy, sometimes
when you're sarcastic like that,

58:03.507 --> 58:07.341
it really makes you sound like a bitch.
And nobody likes a bitch.

58:11.627 --> 58:12.946
Oh, my God.

58:16.067 --> 58:19.457
It's Mickey. I would know
those ugly-ass shoes anywhere.

58:19.827 --> 58:21.101
Is he dead?

58:22.027 --> 58:25.463
Well, he has a fucking tire iron
through his head.

58:27.907 --> 58:29.340
Do you think it's the same one
that killed Megan?

58:29.507 --> 58:32.385
You make it sound like
the tire iron killed Megan by itself.

58:32.547 --> 58:34.822
Thank you for the grammar lesson.

58:34.987 --> 58:39.026
I'm just saying it looks a little updated,
doesn't it? Like someone's

58:39.627 --> 58:41.060
pimped it out.

58:44.987 --> 58:47.217
Oh, my God,
are you seeing this?

58:48.147 --> 58:49.102
Who shot this?

58:49.267 --> 58:52.145
This is from Megan's phone.
Look at the angle.

59:02.867 --> 59:05.939
This can't be Megan.
She's rotting in a mineshaft.

59:06.627 --> 59:07.457
This has to be Garret.

59:12.987 --> 59:14.136
We can't let him do that.

59:14.307 --> 59:15.786
If Garret or Megan are killing people,

59:15.947 --> 59:17.346
we have bigger problems
than him texting the police.

59:17.507 --> 59:19.463
We cannot let Ellie see this text message.

59:20.667 --> 59:21.782
Shit. Too late.

59:21.947 --> 59:24.336
Okay, I'm gonna go get the Escalade.
And you go round up the girls.

59:24.507 --> 59:25.906
Okay. Where are we going?

59:26.067 --> 59:27.659
You read the text.
We're gonna go down to the lake

59:27.827 --> 59:30.500
and put an end to this once and for all.

59:33.027 --> 59:34.380
- What is it?
- Get in the car. Jessica's driving.

59:34.547 --> 59:36.424
What did you guys find?

59:36.587 --> 59:40.580
Mickey is dead. We have to go now, okay?
I'll be there in two minutes.

59:42.547 --> 59:43.582
What?

59:49.467 --> 59:52.777
- Do I know you?
- I imagine. Yeah.

59:52.947 --> 59:55.780
You sell weed on the quad, right?

59:55.947 --> 59:59.701
No, I was the valedictorian.
At your graduation?

01:00:00.387 --> 01:00:03.185
- Today?
- No.

01:00:06.707 --> 01:00:09.426
- Andy, I really need to talk to you.
- Yeah?

01:00:10.427 --> 01:00:12.577
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I just...

01:00:13.507 --> 01:00:16.146
There's something I need to take care of.

01:00:16.307 --> 01:00:18.821
I want you to go to your parents'
and I'll meet you there tomorrow.

01:00:18.987 --> 01:00:20.215
Cass, this is ridiculous. I'll stay.

01:00:20.387 --> 01:00:22.105
- We'll drive down together.
- No. Just do me this one favor.

01:00:22.267 --> 01:00:23.700
I promise I'll tell you everything tomorrow.

01:00:23.867 --> 01:00:26.700
Just go get in the car.
Go. Okay? For me.

01:00:27.987 --> 01:00:29.215
All right, fine.

01:00:31.867 --> 01:00:34.506
Sorry. Just doing a little redecorating.

01:00:45.707 --> 01:00:46.981
I gotta go.

01:00:55.587 --> 01:00:57.225
That was so beautiful.

01:00:57.387 --> 01:00:59.582
- I don't understand. Why Mickey?
- I don't know.

01:00:59.747 --> 01:01:01.783
Maybe because he was a dick.

01:01:02.747 --> 01:01:04.863
- Out of my way, bitches!
- Jessica!

01:01:05.027 --> 01:01:05.982
Chill out!

01:01:07.347 --> 01:01:10.623
Look, we have 14 minutes before that clip
is sent to the police.

01:01:09.786 --> 01:01:10.786
I'd rather not spend my childbearing years
in lockup.

01:01:10.787 --> 01:01:12.823
Does anyone have a weapon?
Mace? Anything?

01:01:12.987 --> 01:01:15.455
Yeah, there's a chainsaw
in the glove box.

01:01:15.627 --> 01:01:18.221
Ellie, you've got to stop doing that.

01:01:21.867 --> 01:01:24.381
Where the hell are you going?

01:01:25.667 --> 01:01:26.577
Where are you guys going?
Is the party over already?

01:01:26.747 --> 01:01:28.703
I thought I said not to come.

01:01:28.867 --> 01:01:30.346
Funny thing. It turns out it's not actually
against Greek rules after all.

01:01:30.507 --> 01:01:33.305
- Yeah, but we told you to stay away, so...
- Yeah. But then I thought,

01:01:33.467 --> 01:01:36.698
"Why would I listen to a lying bitch
like you?"

01:01:36.867 --> 01:01:39.256
By the way, my sister hated you. Peace.

01:01:39.427 --> 01:01:42.976
Hey, Jessica, we gotta go.

01:01:44.307 --> 01:01:46.502
I'm gonna deal with you later.

01:01:46.667 --> 01:01:47.782
You might want to deal with that hair first,
'cause it looks like shit.

01:01:47.947 --> 01:01:52.065
Okay.

01:01:54.467 --> 01:01:55.502
She'd have made a great Theta.

01:01:58.307 --> 01:02:00.218
Megan's alive, you guys.

01:02:08.267 --> 01:02:09.461
Ellie, you're being
borderline retarded right now.

01:02:09.627 --> 01:02:11.345
She's not alive. Garret is doing this.

01:02:11.507 --> 01:02:14.021
There should be
a flashlight in there.

01:02:18.627 --> 01:02:20.697
No, but there's a flare gun.

01:02:20.867 --> 01:02:22.858
Daddy has an overactive imagination.

01:02:24.067 --> 01:02:25.944
Good for us.

01:02:26.107 --> 01:02:27.335
Stay close, okay? Keep our heads on.
This could be anyone.

01:02:27.507 --> 01:02:31.705
Okay, so no flashlight.

01:02:33.107 --> 01:02:34.620
Do we have, like, a lighter?
A light? Anything?

01:02:34.787 --> 01:02:38.177
Hold on.

01:02:38.467 --> 01:02:39.661
You know this was all your fault.

01:02:46.227 --> 01:02:48.218
- You guys made me do this.
- Back the fuck up, psycho!

01:02:48.387 --> 01:02:50.662
- Calm down. Calm down.
- Calm down?

01:02:50.827 --> 01:02:52.863
- He killed Mickey.
- You guys, it's the other half.

01:02:53.027 --> 01:02:55.461
You fucking... You fucking bitches!

01:02:55.627 --> 01:02:57.663
Where'd you get that jacket?
And whose blood is that on you?

01:02:57.827 --> 01:03:01.615
It's mine.

01:03:01.787 --> 01:03:03.061
Fuck you! You made me...

01:03:03.867 --> 01:03:05.744
Oh, my God!

01:03:14.747 --> 01:03:15.975
Take that, you freak show.

01:03:16.147 --> 01:03:18.103
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:03:18.667 --> 01:03:20.464
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God, he's not moving.

01:03:21.147 --> 01:03:23.263
Well, it looks like he won't be sending us
any more video clips.

01:03:23.427 --> 01:03:25.702
What the fuck did you do, Jessica?

01:03:25.867 --> 01:03:27.539
- He was coming at you with a knife.
- It was a piece of a mirror!

01:03:27.707 --> 01:03:30.267
Same diff. Should I have waited for him
to stab you guys?

01:03:30.427 --> 01:03:33.419
You should be thanking me right now.

01:03:33.587 --> 01:03:36.021
Okay, three-to-one odds he's still alive.

01:03:36.187 --> 01:03:38.906
Or not.

01:03:51.347 --> 01:03:52.462
Garret?

01:03:53.307 --> 01:03:54.456
My God. He cut his own wrists.

01:03:57.107 --> 01:03:59.701
- No.
- He didn't kill Mickey.

01:03:59.867 --> 01:04:01.346
No, hold on. Let's take a field trip
to reality for a second.

01:04:01.507 --> 01:04:04.419
He sent half the jacket to us, killed Mickey
and then slit his wrist in guilt.

01:04:04.587 --> 01:04:09.138
You guys, it's not Megan.
We killed her. She's dead.

01:04:09.307 --> 01:04:12.936
Oh, yeah? Well, he got the same message
we did. From Megan's phone.

01:04:13.107 --> 01:04:17.066
Now do you believe me? It's Megan.

01:04:18.227 --> 01:04:20.866
There's only one way to find out.

01:04:22.147 --> 01:04:24.377
Oh, Jesus.

01:04:24.547 --> 01:04:25.866
Slower, slower! Easy.

01:04:35.867 --> 01:04:38.586
- Give me as much light as you can!
- This is it.

01:04:45.147 --> 01:04:48.105
More slack!

01:04:51.267 --> 01:04:52.586
Wait! The chain!

01:04:57.107 --> 01:04:58.825
Oh, my God!

01:04:59.227 --> 01:05:00.546
Cassidy!

01:05:01.267 --> 01:05:02.461
- Cass!
- Cass!

01:05:04.427 --> 01:05:05.746
Cassidy?

01:05:07.747 --> 01:05:08.896
Cassidy, are you okay?

01:05:11.067 --> 01:05:12.864
Yeah.

01:05:13.667 --> 01:05:14.622
We're gonna get you
out of there, okay?

01:05:14.787 --> 01:05:17.460
- Oh, my God, Cass!
- Sorry.

01:05:21.027 --> 01:05:22.938
Nice, Ellie.

01:05:24.347 --> 01:05:25.700
- Do you see Megan down there?
- What's going on, Cass?

01:05:33.467 --> 01:05:36.698
Can you see anything?

01:05:45.627 --> 01:05:47.379
Cass?

01:05:49.347 --> 01:05:50.416
I see the blanket, but I don't see Megan.

01:05:51.387 --> 01:05:54.060
- Where is everybody?
- Probably dead.

01:06:26.547 --> 01:06:29.584
Yeah. And then the corpses
drove their cars home, idiot.

01:06:29.747 --> 01:06:32.898
Bitch.

01:06:33.067 --> 01:06:34.182
Bucky? Where did everybody go?

01:06:36.827 --> 01:06:38.658
After-party at Rho Sigma Nu.

01:06:38.827 --> 01:06:41.182
- What's that noise?
- The Jacuzzi. It overheated.

01:06:41.347 --> 01:06:44.544
See you guys there?

01:06:44.707 --> 01:06:46.379
I still can't get Chugs
on the phone.

01:06:47.147 --> 01:06:49.581
Maybe Megan won't kill us.
I mean, we are sisters. Sisters for life, right?

01:06:49.747 --> 01:06:53.626
Yeah, that ought to trump
dumping her down a mineshaft.

01:06:53.787 --> 01:06:56.221
We cannot just leave his body at the lake.

01:06:56.387 --> 01:06:58.696
I don't care what you guys do,

01:06:58.867 --> 01:06:59.982
but I'm gonna go find Kyle
to make sure he's okay

01:07:00.147 --> 01:07:02.103
and then I'm getting my stuff
and I'm getting the hell out of here,

01:07:02.267 --> 01:07:04.462
and never looking back.

01:07:04.627 --> 01:07:06.424
- I'm gonna shut that thing off.
- No! Wait! Don't go alone.

01:07:07.147 --> 01:07:10.059
I'm good.

01:07:10.227 --> 01:07:11.455
Kyle?

01:07:30.507 --> 01:07:31.542
Kyle? Kyle? It's me! Kyle?

01:07:34.707 --> 01:07:38.495
Fuck.

01:08:01.867 --> 01:08:02.902
Oh!

01:08:07.667 --> 01:08:08.782
Great.

01:08:09.747 --> 01:08:10.862
Okay, drunkees, out!

01:08:23.027 --> 01:08:25.018
Fine.

01:08:25.867 --> 01:08:26.935
Out! Out! Out! Get out!

01:08:28.426 --> 01:08:31.975
Oh, my gosh! What the fuck?

01:08:32.147 --> 01:08:33.341
- You're kind of sexy.
- Bye!

01:08:33.506 --> 01:08:35.462
Come on, baby, let's go.

01:08:37.627 --> 01:08:39.219
What's your guys' names?

01:08:39.386 --> 01:08:41.059
Is somebody gonna turn off the music
or do I have to do everything myself?

01:09:26.307 --> 01:09:30.618
- You okay, Ellie?
- No.

01:09:33.907 --> 01:09:36.023
Ellie, come on,
you gotta get it together. Okay?

01:09:39.947 --> 01:09:43.826
Finally, Chugs.

01:09:46.067 --> 01:09:47.546
"Jess, Cass and Ellie,
I'm gonna miss the party."

01:09:51.907 --> 01:09:54.660
No!

01:10:01.027 --> 01:10:01.982
How come that didn't include Claire?

01:10:02.947 --> 01:10:05.461
Oh, gosh! I can't...

01:10:06.347 --> 01:10:07.860
Door won't open!

01:10:08.027 --> 01:10:09.585
Hurry up, Cass!

01:10:09.747 --> 01:10:11.226
Oh, my God!

01:10:11.867 --> 01:10:13.425
Give me your hand, Claire.
Give me your hand!

01:10:14.227 --> 01:10:16.297
Please, help me, please!

01:10:20.867 --> 01:10:23.301
Claire, no!

01:10:27.067 --> 01:10:28.261
Oh, my God! Help!

01:10:32.907 --> 01:10:35.137
- Help!
- Claire!

01:10:40.707 --> 01:10:42.140
Claire?

01:10:53.867 --> 01:10:54.982
- Go, go! Go, go, go!
- What?

01:11:22.387 --> 01:11:24.776
Kyle!

01:11:25.107 --> 01:11:26.176
She's here. It's Megan
and she's gonna kill all of us.

01:11:29.187 --> 01:11:32.418
It's okay. It's okay.

01:11:32.587 --> 01:11:33.940
- Let's go. Come on, Ellie!
- Oh, my God!

01:11:35.467 --> 01:11:37.025
Kyle?

01:11:37.427 --> 01:11:38.462
Kyle?

01:11:39.627 --> 01:11:40.696
Kyle!

01:11:41.387 --> 01:11:42.502
Oh, God.

01:11:45.267 --> 01:11:46.416
Kyle, is that you?

01:11:47.707 --> 01:11:49.299
Kyle?

01:11:51.867 --> 01:11:52.936
- What are you doing in my bed?
- Oh, I met the cutest boy.

01:11:57.347 --> 01:12:01.545
- This one.
- That's my boy.

01:12:01.707 --> 01:12:03.345
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

01:12:03.507 --> 01:12:04.781
Awkward. Anyways, you mind giving us
a little space?

01:12:04.947 --> 01:12:07.620
We were just kind of getting started
when you pulled up, and...

01:12:07.787 --> 01:12:10.426
By the way, I know
you fucked Megan's boyfriend. She told me.

01:12:10.587 --> 01:12:15.263
- Hmm. Payback's such a bitch.
- You're a bitch!

01:12:15.587 --> 01:12:19.057
Stop it!

01:12:24.667 --> 01:12:25.861
You're such a whore!

01:12:27.827 --> 01:12:29.499
- I'll kill you.
- She's in the house.

01:12:33.107 --> 01:12:35.063
- Who's in the house?
- Shut the fuck up!

01:12:35.227 --> 01:12:37.741
Stop it!

01:12:39.587 --> 01:12:40.781
Screw this.

01:12:49.747 --> 01:12:51.066
Mrs. Crenshaw, it's me, Jessica.

01:13:22.747 --> 01:13:24.385
I know. You've had that
coming for four years.

01:13:24.547 --> 01:13:27.380
I saw what you did.

01:13:27.547 --> 01:13:29.219
We didn't mean to kill Megan.

01:13:30.427 --> 01:13:32.543
What?

01:13:33.747 --> 01:13:34.623
Kill Megan?
I was talking about trashing my house.

01:13:34.787 --> 01:13:37.506
You killed my sister? You fucking bitch!

01:13:37.667 --> 01:13:40.818
- Talk.
- Okay, listen. It was an accident

01:13:43.867 --> 01:13:45.903
and we'll explain everything later,
but right now Claire is dead,

01:13:46.067 --> 01:13:48.456
Mickey's dead, Chugs is dead
and we don't know if Megan is alive or not.

01:13:48.627 --> 01:13:51.858
Wait. So Megan is not dead?

01:13:52.027 --> 01:13:54.097
We don't know!
We need to get the hell out of here.

01:13:54.267 --> 01:13:57.100
- Who else is here?
- Kyle.

01:13:57.267 --> 01:13:59.098
- Is he in on this thing?
- No.

01:13:59.267 --> 01:14:01.656
- Lie to me again.
- Okay, I told Kyle about Megan.

01:14:03.387 --> 01:14:06.857
Of course, you did!
What's with this "sisters for life" crap?

01:14:07.027 --> 01:14:10.861
Was I the only one that didn't tell anybody?

01:14:11.027 --> 01:14:14.019
Where is Kyle?

01:14:14.187 --> 01:14:15.620
Don't look at me.
He left as soon as he heard you coming.

01:14:16.547 --> 01:14:19.744
Well, he, she or it
is about to get two rounds to the face.

01:14:19.907 --> 01:14:23.217
You girls wait in Jessica's room.
And call the police.

01:14:23.387 --> 01:14:26.663
Wow, who knew Mrs. Crenshaw
was such a badass?

01:14:28.067 --> 01:14:29.944
Where's your phone?

01:14:30.107 --> 01:14:31.142
Mine?

01:14:31.987 --> 01:14:32.976
I don't know.
I think I dropped it somewhere.

01:14:33.187 --> 01:14:35.655
Where's your phone, Ellie? Ellie!

01:14:35.827 --> 01:14:37.943
I don't really know
where my phone is right now.

01:14:38.107 --> 01:14:39.665
I've had kind of a crazy day.
And I don't really...

01:14:39.827 --> 01:14:42.546
There's been a lot of shit
going down here.

01:14:42.707 --> 01:14:46.017
So can you just give me a minute?

01:14:46.547 --> 01:14:48.060
I don't understand. You're saying
that you think my sister's alive?

01:14:48.227 --> 01:14:51.139
We don't know anything for sure, Maggie.

01:14:51.307 --> 01:14:52.899
- Maybe she got her.
- Oh, my God! No! Megan!

01:14:56.147 --> 01:15:00.186
- No, don't go out there.
- Wait. Wait.

01:15:00.347 --> 01:15:02.986
What? I tried to warn her.

01:15:03.627 --> 01:15:05.458
Come to mama.

01:15:24.107 --> 01:15:25.506
Please don't think I'm afraid of you.

01:15:40.307 --> 01:15:42.377
I run a house with 50 crazy bitches.

01:15:42.547 --> 01:15:45.345
You guys, that's coming
from the back of the house.

01:15:46.307 --> 01:15:47.899
We can make a run for it.

01:15:48.067 --> 01:15:49.056
You guys can do whatever you want.
I'm staying here.

01:15:49.227 --> 01:15:52.025
If I can get to Mickey's body,
I can get his phone and we can call for help.

01:15:52.187 --> 01:15:54.940
Okay, well, I'm going with you.

01:15:55.107 --> 01:15:56.540
Okay, I could use your cover with the ax.
But you work with me, understand?

01:15:56.707 --> 01:16:00.495
I don't want to turn around
and not be able to find you.

01:16:00.667 --> 01:16:02.578
Cassidy! Seriously?
After everything we've been through?

01:16:02.747 --> 01:16:06.581
Okay, Ellie? If you get a chance to run,
take it. Don't worry about us.

01:16:06.747 --> 01:16:10.376
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:16:10.547 --> 01:16:11.900
Meg?

01:16:19.867 --> 01:16:20.902
Megan?

01:16:26.147 --> 01:16:27.262
It's Mags.

01:16:28.667 --> 01:16:29.941
God!

01:17:00.347 --> 01:17:01.416
You stay the fuck away from my girls.

01:17:20.907 --> 01:17:24.263
Megan?

01:17:30.907 --> 01:17:32.022
You there?

01:17:38.867 --> 01:17:40.141
Megan? Is that you?

01:17:52.467 --> 01:17:54.697
Oh, my God.

01:17:58.347 --> 01:17:59.621
I have to do something.

01:18:10.187 --> 01:18:12.018
Okay, okay.

01:18:16.947 --> 01:18:18.221
Shit.

01:18:21.707 --> 01:18:22.696
Come on.

01:18:32.907 --> 01:18:34.101
Please, God, don't let me get killed.

01:18:37.667 --> 01:18:39.385
- Please, God, don't let me get killed.
- Stop giving him ideas.

01:18:39.547 --> 01:18:43.256
- Okay.
- Come on.

01:18:45.027 --> 01:18:46.699
Kyle?

01:18:55.667 --> 01:18:56.702
What are you doing here?

01:18:58.667 --> 01:19:00.100
When I heard you calling, I was...

01:19:00.267 --> 01:19:03.384
I heard gunshots.

01:19:03.547 --> 01:19:04.662
- Why are you wearing that gown?
- And why aren't you wearing any pants?

01:19:04.827 --> 01:19:08.866
- I threw something on, because...
- You fucked her, didn't you?

01:19:09.027 --> 01:19:11.746
- I need you to get a hold of yourself.
- You fucked her!

01:19:11.907 --> 01:19:13.340
Don't tell me to calm down!

01:19:13.507 --> 01:19:15.543
I warned you, Jessica.

01:19:18.827 --> 01:19:21.136
You just couldn't hold it together,
could you?

01:19:21.307 --> 01:19:24.140
Put the ax down.
Honey, I really don't want to hurt you.

01:19:25.267 --> 01:19:29.226
What do you think you're doing?

01:19:32.747 --> 01:19:34.942
Give me the phone!

01:19:36.907 --> 01:19:38.784
Can't breathe.

01:19:38.947 --> 01:19:40.266
I told you, Jessica, this can't get out.

01:19:40.427 --> 01:19:42.782
Jessica, help me!

01:19:42.947 --> 01:19:44.016
Help? Don't you know anything
about Jessica?

01:19:44.187 --> 01:19:46.257
She's a power whore.

01:19:46.427 --> 01:19:47.860
She'll do anything, as long...

01:19:48.027 --> 01:19:50.382
As long as you keep your dick
in your pants, scumbag.

01:19:50.547 --> 01:19:53.857
Are you crazy?

01:19:54.027 --> 01:19:55.460
Do you have any idea
what my father is capable of?

01:19:56.467 --> 01:19:59.698
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe
I'm fucking the wrong guy!

01:19:59.867 --> 01:20:03.143
- That's it.
- Cassidy! Shit!

01:20:03.307 --> 01:20:06.185
- Some sister she turned out to be.
- Hey, asshole!

01:20:06.347 --> 01:20:09.384
Come on! Come on, come on, come on.

01:20:12.947 --> 01:20:15.336
The window!

01:20:17.147 --> 01:20:18.466
- Shit! The scaffolding.
- Well, good plan!

01:20:21.187 --> 01:20:23.576
Come on, Jess! Cass? Let's hug it out.

01:20:23.747 --> 01:20:28.025
Okay. Who the hell lit the house
on fire? Shit!

01:20:30.347 --> 01:20:32.463
Oh, my God.

01:20:32.627 --> 01:20:33.821
Ladies?

01:20:33.987 --> 01:20:35.420
Jessica! Come on, babe. I'm sorry.

01:20:42.347 --> 01:20:46.977
Come on.

01:20:55.547 --> 01:20:56.696
- Oh, my God! It's Megan! Oh, my God!
- She looks terrible.

01:21:09.067 --> 01:21:12.377
I'm really starting to think
he's not marriage material.

01:21:25.667 --> 01:21:29.057
My dad

01:21:34.347 --> 01:21:35.700
is gonna be

01:21:35.867 --> 01:21:37.778
very angry.

01:21:37.947 --> 01:21:39.983
I can't let my father hang out to dry for this.

01:21:48.107 --> 01:21:50.860
And we're not leaving here
until we come up with a story.

01:21:51.027 --> 01:21:54.463
I guess your boyfriend's not here
to protect you, huh?

01:21:56.547 --> 01:21:59.584
- Guess again.
- Andy?

01:22:07.107 --> 01:22:09.257
It's okay.

01:22:09.427 --> 01:22:10.701
- Oh, my God. You didn't leave?
- It's okay.

01:22:11.067 --> 01:22:13.058
I couldn't, Cass. I knew you were in trouble.

01:22:13.227 --> 01:22:16.105
What... What happened?

01:22:18.867 --> 01:22:20.778
- This place isn't safe.
- You saved me.

01:22:22.147 --> 01:22:24.422
Yeah. And I always will.

01:22:24.587 --> 01:22:27.579
You don't need this place. These people.

01:22:28.187 --> 01:22:30.985
I'm the one who's never gonna let anything
happen to you.

01:22:31.747 --> 01:22:35.183
Oh, my God.

01:22:49.067 --> 01:22:50.341
- What?
- You?

01:22:53.987 --> 01:22:55.943
You?

01:22:57.187 --> 01:22:58.176
You know what? It's okay. This is okay.

01:22:59.027 --> 01:23:01.700
We can fix this. I mean, this is fixable, so...

01:23:03.067 --> 01:23:06.537
Andy, you can count on us.
The five tenets of sister...

01:23:07.867 --> 01:23:11.462
That girl really needs to learn
to keep her mouth shut.

01:23:13.707 --> 01:23:17.063
I know, Cassidy. I know everything.
Ellie told me.

01:23:17.227 --> 01:23:21.459
Some of the things she said
about some of the things you did...

01:23:22.267 --> 01:23:27.022
- You killed...
- I freed us.

01:23:28.587 --> 01:23:30.942
Hey.

01:23:32.747 --> 01:23:33.782
Admit it.

01:23:34.027 --> 01:23:35.301
These are horrible people. Playing house.

01:23:35.867 --> 01:23:38.904
Sitting around circling each other's fat.
Drinking their lives away.

01:23:39.067 --> 01:23:41.979
You've been trying to get away for a year.

01:23:42.147 --> 01:23:44.536
- I'm just helping you cut the cord.
- You killed everybody.

01:23:44.707 --> 01:23:47.983
Well, everybody that knew had to die.

01:23:48.427 --> 01:23:50.463
Claire, Chugs.

01:23:50.627 --> 01:23:51.855
You told Crenshaw. Jessica told Kyle.

01:23:52.027 --> 01:23:54.541
And I'm sure Claire told Mickey.

01:23:54.707 --> 01:23:56.584
You know, and even if she didn't,
that guy really was a dick.

01:23:56.747 --> 01:23:59.420
I didn't kill Garret.

01:23:59.587 --> 01:24:01.339
Give me some credit there.

01:24:01.747 --> 01:24:02.975
Now, then again,
that kid was so ready to snap,

01:24:03.147 --> 01:24:04.819
he had the suicide hotline on speed dial.

01:24:04.987 --> 01:24:07.660
I'm feeling
a little under-appreciated here, Cassidy.

01:24:07.827 --> 01:24:10.341
Don't you see?
You've been attached to this forever.

01:24:10.507 --> 01:24:13.465
One of them gets drunk, gets blabby.

01:24:13.627 --> 01:24:15.060
Some girl overhears it in the bathroom.

01:24:15.227 --> 01:24:17.024
Another spills the beans to her therapist.

01:24:17.187 --> 01:24:18.825
Do you really want to be dealing
with this for the rest of your life?

01:24:18.987 --> 01:24:22.104
For the rest of our lives?

01:24:22.267 --> 01:24:24.223
Now today I gave the valedictorian speech.
Remember?

01:24:25.307 --> 01:24:28.902
"Reputation comes
from the company you keep."

01:24:29.507 --> 01:24:32.340
And the company you keep?

01:24:33.187 --> 01:24:35.098
Bitches.

01:24:36.427 --> 01:24:37.621
Do you know what that word "valedictorian"
comes from?

01:24:39.227 --> 01:24:41.980
<i>It's from the Latin. Vale dicere.</i>

01:24:42.147 --> 01:24:44.502
"To say farewell."

01:24:45.867 --> 01:24:47.459
Well, to the bitches of Theta Pi,

01:24:48.147 --> 01:24:51.219
I'm saying farewell.

01:24:53.107 --> 01:24:54.825
Are you with me?

01:24:56.387 --> 01:24:57.900
Yes.

01:25:05.987 --> 01:25:07.215
I knew you would be.

01:25:07.387 --> 01:25:09.059
It's for the best. For us. For our future.
Hell, for society in general.

01:25:09.227 --> 01:25:14.062
Great.

01:25:15.667 --> 01:25:16.782
Now let's go kill Ellie,
then we're off to my folks' summer house

01:25:21.787 --> 01:25:23.937
for some well-deserved R&R.

01:25:24.107 --> 01:25:25.256
- Wait. Ellie?
- Of course. Come on, we'll both do Ellie.

01:25:25.427 --> 01:25:28.339
You're always saying
we need to do more stuff together.

01:25:28.507 --> 01:25:30.418
I'm with you on everything, but Ellie?
I mean, she's okay.

01:25:30.587 --> 01:25:33.624
You're joking, right?

01:25:33.787 --> 01:25:35.505
She's the weakest of them all.
Hell, she told me.

01:25:36.267 --> 01:25:39.304
But, Andy, the house is on fire.
We gotta go.

01:25:41.107 --> 01:25:43.905
We better move fast.

01:25:44.227 --> 01:25:45.945
Call her name.

01:25:49.747 --> 01:25:51.180
- Ellie will come to you.
- Ellie!

01:25:51.827 --> 01:25:53.624
Ellie! Hey, Andy,
we need to leave right now, okay?

01:25:53.787 --> 01:25:56.938
Okay. You go wait for me outside.

01:25:58.227 --> 01:26:01.424
- I'll take care of Ellie.
- Okay.

01:26:02.467 --> 01:26:04.662
Go tell Ellie to meet me in the basement.

01:26:17.707 --> 01:26:20.016
There's the team spirit.

01:26:20.187 --> 01:26:22.064
Ellie?

01:26:28.947 --> 01:26:30.016
Ellie, where are you?
Come on, come on.

01:26:32.187 --> 01:26:34.382
- What? What?
- Okay, we've got to get out of here now.

01:26:34.547 --> 01:26:36.742
- Is it safe?
- No, it's not safe,

01:26:36.907 --> 01:26:38.022
but it's not getting any safer.

01:26:38.187 --> 01:26:39.256
What?

01:26:39.427 --> 01:26:40.576
Why would you lie to me? Why?

01:26:46.307 --> 01:26:48.218
Do you have any idea
what I've done to give you back your life?

01:26:48.387 --> 01:26:50.742
Ellie, run!

01:26:50.907 --> 01:26:52.181
I am very, very disappointed in you.

01:26:58.507 --> 01:27:01.067
I pinned you, and you left.

01:27:06.027 --> 01:27:07.858
I guess my cell phone
took a Greyhound out of town.

01:27:08.027 --> 01:27:09.824
Yeah, good one.

01:27:09.987 --> 01:27:11.420
Help! Ellie! Cassidy!

01:27:16.787 --> 01:27:19.859
Help! It's Maggie! I'm trapped!

01:27:20.347 --> 01:27:23.419
Help!

01:27:26.387 --> 01:27:27.376
Help me!

01:27:29.147 --> 01:27:30.341
Maggie!

01:27:36.307 --> 01:27:37.422
- I'm trapped!
- Fuck. Okay.

01:27:38.347 --> 01:27:40.258
- Okay, try and jump over.
- What?

01:27:43.147 --> 01:27:45.456
I left your sister.
I'm not gonna leave you, too.

01:27:45.627 --> 01:27:47.618
Get the fuck over here.

01:27:47.787 --> 01:27:49.505
Oh!

01:27:49.667 --> 01:27:50.622
I'm getting goose bumps.

01:27:50.947 --> 01:27:52.824
You might want to stay there, Maggie.

01:27:55.227 --> 01:27:57.104
Out of the fire, into the tire iron.
Do you know what I mean?

01:27:57.267 --> 01:27:59.622
Andy, leave her alone!

01:27:59.787 --> 01:28:00.697
Come over here,
I'll be happy to kill you first.

01:28:00.867 --> 01:28:03.381
Not to worry, Maggie.

01:28:13.427 --> 01:28:15.145
What kind of guy would I be
if I let you burn to death?

01:28:15.307 --> 01:28:18.663
- Andy, don't do this!
- Stop it! Just stop it!

01:28:22.547 --> 01:28:25.141
I will, but you need to stand perfectly still.

01:28:25.307 --> 01:28:28.219
Hey.

01:28:44.827 --> 01:28:45.862
Come on, Maggie!
Come on, get over! Come on.

01:28:47.987 --> 01:28:51.457
- Maggie! Come on, come on, come on.
- Watch out!

01:28:51.627 --> 01:28:55.063
Oh, my God! Get off of her!

01:28:55.707 --> 01:28:58.267
Oh, fuck!

01:29:09.707 --> 01:29:10.901
- Andy, please help me.
- I tried to help you.

01:29:15.787 --> 01:29:18.540
You didn't want my help, remember?

01:29:19.667 --> 01:29:21.498
Do you know how many times
I tried to get you to tell me the truth?

01:29:21.667 --> 01:29:24.227
I practically begged you.

01:29:24.387 --> 01:29:26.139
But no.
You decided to protect your girlfriends.

01:29:28.907 --> 01:29:32.183
I loved you so much, Cass.

01:29:33.227 --> 01:29:35.377
I thought you were different.
But as it turns out, you were just the same.

01:29:35.547 --> 01:29:39.335
Sisters till the end.

01:29:39.507 --> 01:29:41.259
Well, as this year's valedictorian,

01:29:43.667 --> 01:29:46.579
- I guess it's time to say...
- Farewell, asshole.

01:29:47.947 --> 01:29:50.939
Maggie, use the curtain to wrap yourself up.

01:30:13.907 --> 01:30:16.740
Grab my hand.

01:30:20.067 --> 01:30:21.466
I thought I told you to get out of here.

01:30:34.227 --> 01:30:35.626
You did,
but then I thought, "What are sisters for?"

01:30:35.787 --> 01:30:38.904
<i>Don't touch me, trust me</i>

01:30:40.947 --> 01:30:43.381
<i>You disgust me</i>

01:30:43.547 --> 01:30:44.866
<i>Tried to shove me
in your daddy's money</i>

01:30:45.027 --> 01:30:48.906
<i>But I'm better on my own</i>

01:30:49.067 --> 01:30:51.376
<i>I've got some things
that I do better on my own</i>

01:30:51.787 --> 01:30:54.984
<i>I'll show you how
you turn my insides out</i>

01:30:55.747 --> 01:31:00.218
<i>Get the hell away from me</i>

01:31:00.467 --> 01:31:02.378
<i>It's an emergency</i>

01:31:02.547 --> 01:31:04.902
<i>Turn me black and blue</i>

01:31:05.307 --> 01:31:07.867
<i>Get the hell away from me</i>

01:31:08.467 --> 01:31:10.423
<i>All of my friends agree</i>

01:31:10.587 --> 01:31:12.657
<i>I gotta run away from you</i>

01:31:12.827 --> 01:31:15.819
The house is clear.
Come on, let's go.

01:31:20.587 --> 01:31:24.546
<i>Do you remember all we had?</i>

01:31:37.027 --> 01:31:41.305
<i>How we loved It all</i>

01:31:42.867 --> 01:31:45.779
<i>Such a perfect world</i>

01:31:46.547 --> 01:31:49.345
<i>We trusted all</i>

01:31:51.027 --> 01:31:53.825
Theta Pi says goodbye!
Theta Pi says goodbye!

01:31:57.707 --> 01:32:00.426
Theta Pi says goodbye!
Theta Pi says goodbye!

01:32:00.587 --> 01:32:03.579
Theta Pi says goodbye!
Theta Pi says goodbye!

01:32:03.747 --> 01:32:06.580
Theta Pi says goodbye!
Theta Pi says goodbye!

01:32:06.747 --> 01:32:09.784
<i>Don't push It
your bullshit don't phase me</i>

01:32:27.707 --> 01:32:31.620
<i>You can cut me but I won't bleed baby</i>

01:32:31.787 --> 01:32:35.621
<i>'Cause I'm better on my own</i>

01:32:35.787 --> 01:32:38.426
<i>I've got some things
that I do better on my own</i>

01:32:38.587 --> 01:32:42.421
<i>I'll show you how
you turn yourself around</i>

01:32:42.587 --> 01:32:46.660
<i>Get the hell away from me
It's an emergency</i>

01:32:47.307 --> 01:32:51.266
<i>Turn me black and blue</i>

01:32:52.267 --> 01:32:54.735
<i>Get the hell away from me
All of my friends agree</i>

01:32:55.267 --> 01:32:59.306
<i>I gotta break away from you</i>

01:32:59.587 --> 01:33:02.659
<i>Do you remember all we had?</i>

01:33:05.387 --> 01:33:08.220
<i>How we loved It all</i>

01:33:09.627 --> 01:33:12.380
<i>Such a perfect world</i>

01:33:13.267 --> 01:33:16.339
<i>That we trusted all</i>

01:33:17.627 --> 01:33:20.699
<i>Now It's time</i>

01:33:21.667 --> 01:33:23.498
<i>To let go</i>

01:33:23.667 --> 01:33:25.578
<i>Baby don't touch me, trust me
Don't touch me</i>

01:33:36.347 --> 01:33:40.181
<i>Baby don't touch me, trust me</i>

01:33:40.347 --> 01:33:43.180
<i>Get the hell away from me
It's an emergency</i>

01:33:43.347 --> 01:33:47.340
<i>Turn me black and blue</i>

01:33:48.307 --> 01:33:50.821
<i>Get the hell away from me
All of my friends agree</i>

01:33:51.347 --> 01:33:55.056
<i>I gotta break away from you</i>

01:33:55.227 --> 01:33:58.776
<i>Get the hell away from me
It's an emergency</i>

01:34:00.107 --> 01:34:03.338
<i>Better on my own
Turn me black and blue</i>

01:34:03.667 --> 01:34:06.864
<i>Get the hell away from me
All of my friends agree</i>

01:34:07.387 --> 01:34:11.346
<i>Better on my own
And away from you</i>

01:34:11.707 --> 01:34:14.938
<i>Headlights tearing through the fog</i>

01:34:23.547 --> 01:34:26.345
<i>Top down, hear the engine call</i>

01:34:26.507 --> 01:34:29.260
<i>So cold, burning through the black</i>

01:34:29.427 --> 01:34:32.260
<i>Walt up, daddy's coming back</i>

01:34:32.427 --> 01:34:35.225
<i>You're so alone
Back at the door</i>

01:34:35.387 --> 01:34:38.140
<i>I'm coming home
Back at the door</i>

01:34:38.307 --> 01:34:41.060
<i>You need your fix
Back at the door</i>

01:34:41.227 --> 01:34:44.060
<i>Gonna give you more</i>

01:34:44.227 --> 01:34:47.299
<i>Coming down, gonna take you away</i>

01:34:47.467 --> 01:34:49.935
<i>This night won't wait for you</i>

01:34:50.107 --> 01:34:52.780
<i>I'm the one you love, gonna take you away</i>
