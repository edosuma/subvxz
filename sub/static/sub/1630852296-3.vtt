WEBVTT

00:07.746 --> 00:10.967
Unsweetened almond milk latte, no foam.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.012
But that is your drink, right?

00:12.055 --> 00:13.709
Yes.

00:13.752 --> 00:15.841
- On me.
- Thanks.

00:15.885 --> 00:17.321
Uh...

00:17.365 --> 00:18.844
Look, we shouldn't--

00:18.888 --> 00:21.804
like, we should just act
like we didn't, you know?

00:21.847 --> 00:23.501
Oh, um, I think--

00:23.545 --> 00:25.025
You know, just to keep it
professional.

00:25.068 --> 00:26.287
'Cause I'm not trying to be

00:26.330 --> 00:28.332
anything more than coworkers
with you,

00:28.376 --> 00:29.638
and I don't want you to bring,

00:29.681 --> 00:31.161
like, a bouquet of roses
next time.

00:31.205 --> 00:33.642
Jack, my man.

00:33.685 --> 00:35.818
Thank you.
- You got him a...

00:35.861 --> 00:38.864
Uh, dude, how'd you know
I like six pumps of hazelnut?

00:38.908 --> 00:40.953
It's, like, the perfect amount
of hazelnut.

00:44.566 --> 00:46.742
You got coffee for everyone?

00:46.785 --> 00:48.091
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:48.135 --> 00:49.440
- But you were saying?
- No.

00:49.484 --> 00:50.528
- I think...
- Nope.

00:50.572 --> 00:51.703
Something about roses,
wasn't it?

00:51.747 --> 00:54.750
No. N-O.

00:54.793 --> 00:57.796
Thanks for the coffee.
- You are welcome.

00:57.840 --> 01:00.060
<i>♪ Bom bom</i> <i>
bom-bom-bom-bom-bom ♪</i>

01:00.103 --> 01:02.279
<i>♪ Buh buh bom-bom-bom</i> <i>
buh bom-bom-bom-bom ♪</i>

01:05.239 --> 01:07.110
Hi, yes.

01:07.154 --> 01:08.764
Hold on one second.

01:08.807 --> 01:11.810
Can you flip those any louder?

01:11.854 --> 01:13.508
Has anyone seen our CFO?

01:13.551 --> 01:15.292
Guy made such a stink
about being on time,

01:15.336 --> 01:16.380
and now I bet
he's gonna be late.

01:16.424 --> 01:17.773
God, I hate people like that.

01:17.816 --> 01:21.385
- Um, I'm here.
- Oh. Well, hi. Hi, Jin.

01:21.429 --> 01:23.474
Next time, say hello.
Don't be rude.

01:23.518 --> 01:26.738
I did, and you said hello
back, like, five minutes ago.

01:26.782 --> 01:28.131
Nobody likes a shamer.

01:28.175 --> 01:30.002
Hey, so what's
the deal with today?

01:30.046 --> 01:32.179
Some type of big
conference call?

01:32.222 --> 01:33.615
Earnings call.

01:33.658 --> 01:35.573
Yes, like in your former
line of work when the--

01:35.617 --> 01:39.490
like, the main factory man is--

01:39.534 --> 01:41.231
there's an inspection, and he--

01:41.275 --> 01:42.624
Do you know what? I'm sorry.

01:42.667 --> 01:44.104
I don't really know anything
about manual labor.

01:44.147 --> 01:46.410
Every quarter, we report
our earnings to investors.

01:46.454 --> 01:48.412
If they're good,
stock price goes up.

01:48.456 --> 01:50.414
If they're bad,
stock price goes down.

01:50.458 --> 01:51.720
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

01:51.763 --> 01:53.243
And, uh, this quarter is...
- Real bad.

01:53.287 --> 01:54.766
Yeah, but we're gonna
make them sound good

01:54.810 --> 01:56.855
so the stock
doesn't take too much of a hit.

01:56.899 --> 01:59.249
It's kinda the art
of an earnings call.

01:59.293 --> 02:00.511
- And that helps?
- Not really.

02:00.555 --> 02:02.078
No.
Got excited about saying

02:02.122 --> 02:03.471
"the art of an earnings call,"

02:03.514 --> 02:05.125
but I've got nothing
to back it up with.

02:05.168 --> 02:07.083
Sure, the numbers are weak,

02:07.127 --> 02:09.607
but they're not that out
of line with our competitors.

02:09.651 --> 02:12.175
I think if you just
project a positive,

02:12.219 --> 02:14.308
confident tone, it'll--

02:14.351 --> 02:16.527
Oh, I'm not worried.
I mean, I just started here.

02:16.571 --> 02:18.225
I'm not responsible
for last quarter.

02:18.268 --> 02:20.618
No, I'm not saying
that you'd be blamed.

02:20.662 --> 02:22.968
I know. I mean, if anything,
the worse Payne looks now,

02:23.012 --> 02:24.970
the better I look later,
you know what I mean?

02:25.014 --> 02:27.147
It's like those
weight loss journey photos.

02:27.190 --> 02:29.366
It's like if,
in the before picture,

02:29.410 --> 02:30.976
maybe you stick your belly out
a little bit

02:31.020 --> 02:33.022
and then, "Oh, I'm so big
and fat," you know?

02:33.065 --> 02:34.806
And that way, even if
you don't lose a pound,

02:34.850 --> 02:37.548
all of a sudden, hmm,
looks like you're so skinny.

02:37.592 --> 02:41.204
Yeah. I mean, I can see how
that would make you look good.

02:41.248 --> 02:42.379
Less so the rest of us.

02:42.423 --> 02:44.338
But if it looks too bad,

02:44.381 --> 02:46.383
it will kill our stock price,
so...

02:46.427 --> 02:49.125
Well, I mean, my options
don't vest until 2025.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.519
Until then, it's just
20 million monopoly dollars

02:51.562 --> 02:52.607
I can't touch,
you know what I mean?

02:52.650 --> 02:54.174
- 20 million.
- Yeah.

02:54.217 --> 02:55.479
That is a lot

02:55.523 --> 02:59.222
but makes sense
'cause you're the CEO.

02:59.266 --> 03:00.310
Yeah, I think so.

03:00.354 --> 03:02.443
Hey, do you know anything

03:02.486 --> 03:04.227
about insider trading?

03:04.271 --> 03:06.534
Well, I'm the general counsel
of a publicly traded company,

03:06.577 --> 03:08.710
so I'd like to hope
I know a little.

03:08.753 --> 03:12.322
Right, so if someone sold
shares before an earnings call

03:12.366 --> 03:14.585
where they know
the numbers aren't strong...

03:14.629 --> 03:15.934
Oh, that's insider training.

03:15.978 --> 03:17.327
- Let me finish.
- Mm-hmm.

03:17.371 --> 03:18.807
But that knowledge
isn't the reason they sold,

03:18.850 --> 03:20.678
which they can prove because
they still have the notes

03:20.722 --> 03:22.202
that they'd written
on a newspaper

03:22.245 --> 03:23.377
from several months ago

03:23.420 --> 03:25.466
saying they planned
on selling today...

03:25.509 --> 03:27.381
Wait, they wrote the notes
several months ago

03:27.424 --> 03:29.296
or they wrote the notes today

03:29.339 --> 03:31.036
on a newspaper
from several months ago?

03:31.080 --> 03:33.822
- How would you know?
- Huh, it's interesting.

03:33.865 --> 03:35.432
Well, here's
a question for you.

03:35.476 --> 03:38.783
Is the person investigating you
a third grader

03:38.827 --> 03:41.221
dressed as a detective
for Halloween?

03:41.264 --> 03:42.265
No, it's not.

03:42.309 --> 03:43.919
Is it the FBI?

03:43.962 --> 03:45.355
It would be them, yes.

03:45.399 --> 03:48.097
Gosh, well, that's a, uh--
that's a real thinker.

03:48.140 --> 03:50.230
Okay, look, I have this guy
in the Caymans.

03:50.273 --> 03:51.840
Oh, excuse me. Sorry.

03:51.883 --> 03:53.885
I have a policy
for my own protection

03:53.929 --> 03:56.627
to exit any conversation
where someone uses the phrase

03:56.671 --> 03:59.195
"I have a guy in the Caymans,"
so good luck.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.762
Remember,
when you get to prison,

04:00.805 --> 04:02.372
pick the biggest guy
in the yard

04:02.416 --> 04:04.679
and shank him
or whatever it is.

04:04.722 --> 04:07.247
Okay, whatever, weirdo.

04:07.290 --> 04:09.553
Anyway, if I call my guy
and I'm like,

04:09.597 --> 04:11.816
"Hey, how's the weather
down there?"

04:11.860 --> 04:13.557
that means that the stock
is going down

04:13.601 --> 04:15.298
and he needs to sell.

04:15.342 --> 04:16.647
But I didn't actually say it.

04:16.691 --> 04:18.258
That sounds a little sketchy.

04:18.301 --> 04:19.781
No, he's, like, super legit.

04:19.824 --> 04:21.957
He uses burner phones.
He's literally untraceable.

04:23.132 --> 04:25.874
Wesley, what do you do here?

04:30.748 --> 04:32.663
Can you please
not pass out the pens?

04:32.707 --> 04:34.274
See, because nobody uses them,

04:34.317 --> 04:36.101
and then I gotta
clean it all up after.

04:36.145 --> 04:37.538
I know you're new here--

04:37.581 --> 04:39.322
Okay, just trying
to make myself useful.

04:39.366 --> 04:40.323
If you ain't doing nothing
right now...

04:40.367 --> 04:41.411
Yeah, I'm not. I'm not.

04:41.455 --> 04:43.021
I'd love a chai latte,
please.

04:44.153 --> 04:45.763
One chai latte.

04:45.807 --> 04:47.374
Oh, are you making
another coffee run?

04:47.417 --> 04:50.464
I would love a large cold brew.
- Okay.

04:50.507 --> 04:52.901
Could I get two
ham and smoked gouda

04:52.944 --> 04:53.945
sous vide egg bites

04:53.989 --> 04:56.557
and one gooey
coconut dream bar?

04:56.600 --> 04:58.994
Backup to the dream bar
is dipped madeleines.

05:00.648 --> 05:02.389
Okay,
I'm connecting the call.

05:02.432 --> 05:03.694
Just tell me when I'm on.

05:03.738 --> 05:04.739
Mm-hmm.

05:04.782 --> 05:06.306
- Mm-hmm, I'm on?
- Mm-hmm.

05:06.349 --> 05:09.439
Hi, thanks for joining
the Payne Motors

05:09.483 --> 05:11.180
quarterly earnings call.

05:11.223 --> 05:13.095
We're so excited to talk to you

05:13.138 --> 05:14.966
about some of the exciting
things we have coming up.

05:15.010 --> 05:18.361
Maybe the most exciting is our
new CEO, Katherine Hastings.

05:18.405 --> 05:19.710
Thank you, Sadie.

05:19.754 --> 05:21.843
You know,
I'm not gonna sit here

05:21.886 --> 05:24.759
and read some big
fake happy speech.

05:28.806 --> 05:30.721
I'm gonna be honest with you.

05:30.765 --> 05:32.375
The numbers last quarter
were rough.

05:32.419 --> 05:34.029
They were no bueno.

05:34.072 --> 05:37.293
Payne is feeling the pain,
as they say.

05:37.859 --> 05:40.992
And look, mistakes were made.
Mea culpa.

05:41.036 --> 05:43.995
Well, not mea culpa.
Actually, they-a culpa.

05:44.039 --> 05:47.042
Anyway, before I turn it over
to our CFO,

05:47.085 --> 05:50.437
who will review some of these
not-so-great numbers,

05:50.480 --> 05:51.873
are there any questions? <i></i>

05:51.916 --> 05:54.310
We have a couple of hands
raised here in the chat.

05:54.354 --> 05:58.532
Let's start off with
the analyst at Morgan Stanley.

05:58.575 --> 05:59.663
Oh. <i></i>

05:59.707 --> 06:01.491
- You are now unmuted.
- Hello there.

06:01.535 --> 06:03.232
<i>Ms. Hastings, hi.</i>

06:03.275 --> 06:04.668
<i>It's clear how you feel about</i> <i>
the state of the company,</i>

06:04.712 --> 06:06.801
<i>but it's also your job as CEO</i>

06:06.844 --> 06:08.106
<i>to bring in new ideas</i> <i>
on day one.</i>

06:08.150 --> 06:09.717
<i>Could you tell us</i> <i>
some of those ideas?</i>

06:09.760 --> 06:13.024
Uh--uh, yeah, ideas. Sure.

06:13.068 --> 06:15.026
Well, I mean, of course
I have lots of ideas.

06:15.070 --> 06:19.074
I mean, I have full notebooks
and whiteboards and--

06:19.117 --> 06:21.598
well, I don't have to tell you
where they're written.

06:21.642 --> 06:23.034
But they're there.

06:23.078 --> 06:24.601
<i>But yeah,</i> <i>
could you give some examples?</i>

06:24.645 --> 06:26.124
Okay, we should only do
one question per person,

06:26.168 --> 06:27.387
so you can cut him off.

06:27.430 --> 06:29.127
I think they wanna hear
one of your ideas.

06:29.171 --> 06:30.477
Yeah, thank you, Jin.

06:30.520 --> 06:33.044
Well, you kind of stepped
on the surprise there.

06:33.088 --> 06:37.701
Because yeah, I did have one
very big announcement

06:37.745 --> 06:40.617
that I was saving to make
at the end of this call.

06:40.661 --> 06:43.228
And I just didn't wanna,
you know, blow my load

06:43.272 --> 06:45.492
right out of the top here.

06:45.535 --> 06:47.232
I didn't mean, you know,
blow your load.

06:47.276 --> 06:49.974
I didn't mean blow my load.

06:50.018 --> 06:51.019
I wasn't talking--

06:51.062 --> 06:53.891
is the expression
"blow my load,"

06:53.935 --> 06:55.415
is that
about ejaculation always?

06:55.458 --> 06:57.112
- Semen.
- Yes.

06:57.155 --> 06:58.635
Because to me,
it's about skeet shooting.

06:58.679 --> 07:00.289
It's just, I grew up--
I was a summer camp person,

07:00.332 --> 07:02.291
and we would blow our load,

07:02.334 --> 07:03.727
you know,
regularly for the batch.

07:03.771 --> 07:05.425
But you know
what we're gonna do?

07:05.468 --> 07:07.775
We're gonna Google that sucker,
and we will circle back.

07:07.818 --> 07:10.473
And for the moment, I will
hand it over to you, Jin.

07:10.517 --> 07:11.474
Thank you so much.

07:11.518 --> 07:13.824
Hello, I'm Jintao Kang,

07:13.868 --> 07:15.739
Payne's chief financial
officer.

07:15.783 --> 07:17.959
I'll start by discussing
the Q1 balance sheet.

07:20.396 --> 07:22.659
What do these people
expect from me?

07:22.703 --> 07:23.921
When I first started at York,
no one was like,

07:23.965 --> 07:25.053
"Hey, you've been here
for six weeks.

07:25.096 --> 07:26.446
What diseases
are you gonna cure?"

07:26.489 --> 07:28.404
Do you know how long it takes
to develop a drug?

07:28.448 --> 07:31.059
Well, we're here now.
The clock is ticking.

07:31.102 --> 07:32.756
And we falsely promised
a big announcement.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.411
I mean, maybe we can just
walk this back somehow.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.413
No, I'm not gonna make
an idiot of myself

07:37.457 --> 07:39.502
on my first earnings call,
okay?

07:39.546 --> 07:41.548
So what is exciting
that's coming down the pipeline

07:41.591 --> 07:42.940
that we can announce?

07:42.984 --> 07:44.507
We're going into production
on the Payne Pika.

07:44.551 --> 07:47.118
It'll retail for $12,600,
making it the most--

07:47.162 --> 07:48.424
Can it be $10,000?

07:48.468 --> 07:51.079
No, we barely got it down
to $12,600, so--

07:51.122 --> 07:52.036
Okay, but people like
a round number,

07:52.080 --> 07:53.081
you know what I mean?

07:53.124 --> 07:54.169
You go to the Dollar Store.

07:54.212 --> 07:55.083
You don't go
to the $1.26 Store.

07:55.126 --> 07:56.563
It's like, "26?" I mean, uh.

07:56.606 --> 07:58.173
What if you told people
you're pregnant?

07:58.216 --> 07:59.609
At your age,
it would be shocking.

07:59.653 --> 08:01.437
Like, people would be
scared for you.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.917
Cool.
Can we beat old pregnant lady?

08:02.960 --> 08:05.789
The new auto workers contract
is all but finalized.

08:05.833 --> 08:08.009
Which we can't announce
since it is not finalized.

08:08.052 --> 08:09.140
Why can't we finalize it now?

08:09.184 --> 08:10.707
Our negotiator
is hiking the Himalayas.

08:10.751 --> 08:12.230
Oh, really?
In the middle of talks.

08:12.274 --> 08:13.841
Must be nice.
- His father has cancer.

08:13.884 --> 08:16.191
I think it was, like, a last
trip together sort of a thing.

08:16.234 --> 08:17.453
Wow, it's always something,
isn't it?

08:17.497 --> 08:18.628
People love pregnancy stuff.

08:18.672 --> 08:20.325
Those posts get
so many likes on Insta.

08:20.369 --> 08:21.892
Great. What are the sticking
points on the contract?

08:21.936 --> 08:23.764
I think they're after
another four vacation days.

08:23.807 --> 08:25.417
Okay, great.

08:25.461 --> 08:26.854
Get the union guys down here,
offer them three, wrap it up.

08:26.897 --> 08:28.159
We'll announce it on the call.

08:28.203 --> 08:29.509
- Me?
- Yeah. You know what?

08:29.552 --> 08:31.075
Take him with you
for credibility.

08:31.119 --> 08:32.816
Yeah, you used to do labor.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.731
Do you wanna do it, Jack?

08:34.775 --> 08:36.777
- Definitely.
- Okay, great. Do it quickly.

08:36.820 --> 08:38.779
And Sadie will keep the call
going until we're done.

08:38.822 --> 08:41.564
After Jin's part,
there's not much for me to say.

08:41.608 --> 08:45.220
But I'll say it slowly.
Please, hurry.

08:45.263 --> 08:46.656
Hey, hey, hey, if you guys
get this deal done,

08:46.700 --> 08:48.876
it'll probably boost
the stock price, right?

08:48.919 --> 08:51.052
- Yeah. Why?
- Just curious.

08:51.095 --> 08:54.011
Yo, what's up down there?

08:54.055 --> 08:56.492
I mean...what's up?

08:56.536 --> 08:59.887
Forget the down part.
Just, what's up?

08:59.930 --> 09:01.802
What's up?
Remember the code?

09:01.845 --> 09:03.368
When I say, "What's up?"
you buy the stock.

09:03.412 --> 09:05.240
Damn it. Wrong number.

09:05.283 --> 09:06.850
I found this phone.
I don't know whose it is.

09:06.894 --> 09:08.460
I just called a random number.

09:08.504 --> 09:10.593
With an EBIT margin,
also known

09:10.637 --> 09:14.684
as an operating profit margin,
at 11.5%,

09:14.728 --> 09:16.207
which concludes my report.

09:16.251 --> 09:17.687
Thank you, Jin.

09:17.731 --> 09:19.820
Now, do you think
you could recap those numbers

09:19.863 --> 09:22.431
in a more conceptual way?

09:22.474 --> 09:23.606
Why?

09:23.650 --> 09:25.347
Just so we have it.

09:25.390 --> 09:28.306
No, I think we're good.

09:28.350 --> 09:33.137
In that case, I will recap
some of Jin's numbers.

09:33.181 --> 09:35.618
Eep. Okay.

09:35.662 --> 09:38.490
11.5% profit margin.

09:38.534 --> 09:42.190
See, that, for everyone
out there, it's more than 10,

09:42.233 --> 09:43.626
but it's not quite 12.

09:43.670 --> 09:46.586
And percent
is out of a hundred.

09:46.629 --> 09:48.457
Gentlemen,
thanks for coming over so fast.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.067
Wanna get all this
wrapped up.

09:50.111 --> 09:51.678
This is Jack,
who used to work--

09:51.721 --> 09:53.854
Oh, I know Jack, just never
seen him cleaned up before.

09:53.897 --> 09:55.072
How you doing, man?

09:55.116 --> 09:56.639
- Good to see you, man.
- Yeah, you too.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.032
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Steve was my shop steward.

09:58.075 --> 09:59.424
- Ah.
- Yeah, back when he

09:59.468 --> 10:00.861
was on the line
with us regular folk.

10:00.904 --> 10:02.732
Then one day, bam,

10:02.776 --> 10:04.516
gets swooped up
to the ivory tower,

10:04.560 --> 10:05.866
like a Disney movie.

10:05.909 --> 10:07.432
Just call me Aladdin.

10:07.476 --> 10:08.651
I was thinking more like
"The Little Mermaid."

10:10.174 --> 10:11.698
I suppose that makes me
Sebastian?

10:11.741 --> 10:13.961
Do you remember him?

10:14.004 --> 10:16.964
He was the jolly crab.
I think he was a Jamaican.

10:17.007 --> 10:18.443
The crab lived in the water.

10:18.487 --> 10:20.228
You'd be more like one
of the prince's land friends.

10:20.271 --> 10:23.797
- Sir Grimsby.
- Yeah, you'd be Sir Grimsby.

10:23.840 --> 10:24.972
Right, well, okay.

10:25.015 --> 10:26.974
Shall we get
this thing started?

10:27.017 --> 10:29.019
And profit is what you make

10:29.063 --> 10:30.847
minus what you spent
to make it.

10:30.891 --> 10:32.370
I say that right?
- Mm-hmm.

10:32.414 --> 10:34.416
Oh, and now
I'll turn you over

10:34.459 --> 10:36.984
to our chief designer,
Cyrus Knight,

10:37.027 --> 10:40.596
who would like to discuss with
you some of the developments

10:40.640 --> 10:44.818
coming up in automotive
technology in the future.

10:44.861 --> 10:46.036
Sure, yeah.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.472
There's a few innovations
we might see

10:47.516 --> 10:49.039
over the next five years.

10:49.083 --> 10:51.607
Or even the next 20.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.349
Well, I think we're
in agreement on the key issues.

10:54.392 --> 10:57.265
So how about we throw in
an extra vacation day

10:57.308 --> 10:59.136
and put this puppy to bed?

10:59.180 --> 11:00.616
We're asking for four days.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.444
I'm asking for a night
of unbridled passion

11:02.487 --> 11:03.880
with, uh, Holly Willoughby,

11:03.924 --> 11:06.666
but I don't think
that's gonna happen, do we?

11:06.709 --> 11:08.145
She's very lovely.

11:08.189 --> 11:11.148
Um, look, cards on the table,
I can go to two days.

11:11.192 --> 11:13.324
We'll meet you in the middle,
three.

11:13.368 --> 11:15.457
Ed, I would love
to give you three days.

11:15.500 --> 11:18.199
But like I said, it's two days.
Take it or leave it.

11:18.242 --> 11:19.591
- Can you give us a minute?
- Sure.

11:19.635 --> 11:21.681
Discuss amongst yourselves.

11:21.724 --> 11:24.205
Hey, didn't Katherine say
we can give them three days?

11:24.248 --> 11:26.816
Yeah, so think how good we'll
look if they just take two.

11:26.860 --> 11:28.035
It's like extra credit.

11:28.078 --> 11:29.863
Okay.

11:29.906 --> 11:30.951
Two days. Deal.

11:30.994 --> 11:32.430
Fantastic.
Thank you, gentlemen.

11:32.474 --> 11:34.302
Give us 15 minutes,
and we will draft something up

11:34.345 --> 11:35.346
that you guys can take
a look at.

11:35.390 --> 11:37.000
Great. Thank you.

11:38.306 --> 11:40.525
Ariel.

11:40.569 --> 11:42.484
Seriously, man, I'm glad
to see you doing so well.

11:42.527 --> 11:44.138
It's nice to have
one of our own up there

11:44.181 --> 11:46.357
looking out for us.

11:46.401 --> 11:48.620
- They can go to three days.
- What?

11:48.664 --> 11:50.100
Katherine wants to announce
the deal today

11:50.144 --> 11:51.232
on an earnings call,
so she said

11:51.275 --> 11:52.712
we can give you guys
up to three days.

11:54.539 --> 11:55.758
Why are you telling me this?

11:55.802 --> 11:57.499
Because, man, I just--

11:57.542 --> 11:59.153
I remember what those extra
vacation days

11:59.196 --> 12:00.502
meant to all
those guys down there.

12:00.545 --> 12:03.984
Wow.
Thanks, Jack, that means a lot.

12:04.027 --> 12:05.637
Got it.

12:05.681 --> 12:06.900
So we have a lot of leverage?

12:06.943 --> 12:08.553
Yeah, to get
the extra vacation day.

12:08.597 --> 12:11.208
Hey, guys, guess what
my little mermaid just told me.

12:11.252 --> 12:12.906
We got them over a barrel.
- No, that's--

12:12.949 --> 12:15.082
I was just trying to get you
the extra vacation day.

12:18.476 --> 12:20.783
Six extra vacation days,
dental HMO,

12:20.827 --> 12:22.524
a gym voucher, longer breaks--

12:22.567 --> 12:24.569
Sorry, I'm a bit confused.

12:24.613 --> 12:26.223
I thought the sticking point
was vacation days.

12:26.267 --> 12:28.051
How did all of this
get opened up again?

12:28.095 --> 12:30.314
It's so confusing.
I don't know what's going on.

12:30.358 --> 12:32.316
All right, I'm authorized
to offer you three days.

12:32.360 --> 12:35.102
That is the absolute maximum,
so we can't go above that.

12:35.145 --> 12:36.538
That's what you said
about two days.

12:36.581 --> 12:38.061
Yes, yes. Thank you, Ed.

12:38.105 --> 12:40.585
Well minuted,
but I was lying to you then.

12:40.629 --> 12:43.719
For that, I am very sorry,
but I'm telling the truth now.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.199
Absolute truth.
This is it.

12:45.242 --> 12:47.375
So you have to believe me.
Please?

12:47.418 --> 12:50.334
Nope? Okay.
So I'll be right back.

12:50.378 --> 12:54.948
And by 2050, I expect we'll
have autonomous drone vehicles,

12:54.991 --> 12:58.908
many of them flying,
powered by the sun and/or wind

12:58.952 --> 13:00.867
and/or nuclear energy.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.042
Hey, hey, hey. Come.

13:02.085 --> 13:03.478
If you really examine
how we have--

13:03.521 --> 13:04.827
Thank you so much, Cyrus.

13:04.871 --> 13:06.350
That made me think.

13:06.394 --> 13:08.004
Katherine here.

13:08.048 --> 13:10.877
I am so pleased to finally--

13:12.574 --> 13:13.923
I'm so sorry.

13:13.967 --> 13:15.707
My CCO has just told me

13:15.751 --> 13:18.754
that she has something
very important to communicate,

13:18.798 --> 13:20.887
and so I'm gonna
leave it to her.

13:21.583 --> 13:27.371
Yes, I just thought it was
important to acknowledge

13:27.415 --> 13:32.463
the people we've lost this year
at Payne due to...death.

13:32.507 --> 13:34.596
I thought it was just
a matter of vacation days.

13:34.639 --> 13:37.207
This reads like
a terrorist's list of demands.

13:37.251 --> 13:39.427
I was completely blindsided,
I'm sorry.

13:39.470 --> 13:40.515
It's not your fault.

13:40.558 --> 13:42.865
You know who really
screwed us over?

13:42.909 --> 13:45.868
That labor negotiator.
"My daddy has cancer"?

13:45.912 --> 13:47.565
Oh, come on.
Really?

13:47.609 --> 13:50.351
We're supposed to believe that
a terminally ill cancer patient

13:50.394 --> 13:52.222
has the energy
to climb a mountain?

13:52.266 --> 13:53.441
I think
it's the kind of cancer

13:53.484 --> 13:54.616
where you stop taking chemo

13:54.659 --> 13:56.705
and then you start feeling
pretty good.

13:56.748 --> 13:57.880
And then you die.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.490
Well, that's really sad.

13:59.534 --> 14:01.579
Maybe we should send him one
of those fruit bouquet things.

14:01.623 --> 14:04.234
- Mm-hmm.
- Mildred Burko.

14:04.278 --> 14:05.932
Derek something,

14:05.975 --> 14:07.411
can't remember his last name.

14:07.455 --> 14:09.283
He was short
and had a lazy eye.

14:09.326 --> 14:11.415
It wasn't lazy. One was
just smaller than the other.

14:11.459 --> 14:13.809
Okay, well,
Derek whatever his name--

14:13.853 --> 14:15.028
- Ptosis.
- Derek Ptosis.

14:15.071 --> 14:16.333
No, that's the condition

14:16.377 --> 14:17.900
where one eye
is smaller than the other.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.206
Hey, that guy didn't die.

14:19.249 --> 14:20.903
I think he got arrested
for some photos

14:20.947 --> 14:22.252
he had in his computer.

14:22.296 --> 14:24.602
Anyway, let's all take
a moment of silence

14:24.646 --> 14:26.517
for those no longer with us.

14:26.561 --> 14:27.649
Even Derek?

14:27.692 --> 14:29.694
Can you just
put the call on mute?

14:31.174 --> 14:32.436
I cannot do this anymore.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.786
Hey, our stock price
is in a free fall.

14:34.830 --> 14:36.919
Damn it.
I'm so bad at trading stock.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.268
It should just be
more predictable,

14:38.312 --> 14:40.053
but it goes up and down
all over the place.

14:40.096 --> 14:41.489
It's just--it's not fair.

14:41.532 --> 14:43.186
Well, if it makes you feel
any better,

14:43.230 --> 14:45.362
Katherine's probably
getting hit worse than anyone.

14:45.406 --> 14:47.538
Why?
How much stock does she have?

14:47.582 --> 14:49.018
As of this morning,

14:49.062 --> 14:51.107
her signing bonus
was worth $20 million.

14:51.151 --> 14:52.587
She got $20 million
just to sign?

14:52.630 --> 14:54.284
Are you kidding me?
It's not like she's Elon Musk.

14:54.328 --> 14:55.590
You guys, you guys, I don't
think that we should be talking

14:55.633 --> 14:57.940
about this in front of--

14:57.984 --> 14:59.768
But you put the call on mute.

14:59.811 --> 15:00.943
Mm-hmm.

15:00.987 --> 15:02.510
So they can't hear us.

15:02.553 --> 15:04.468
We can't hear them.

15:04.512 --> 15:06.340
I'm sorry,
did you wanna put us on mute?

15:06.383 --> 15:08.298
'Cause that's different
than putting the call on mute.

15:08.342 --> 15:10.953
So everything we just said?

15:10.997 --> 15:13.347
Thousands of people?

15:13.390 --> 15:18.004
Anyway, so not sure if
any of you heard any of that.

15:18.047 --> 15:19.135
Oh, they did.

15:19.179 --> 15:21.224
We got a lot of questions
coming in.

15:21.268 --> 15:23.487
Derek Gobetti.
That was his name.

15:23.531 --> 15:26.186
Derek Gobetti.
That guy was hilarious.

15:26.229 --> 15:28.188
I wish I could give you
everything on this list.

15:28.231 --> 15:31.887
Believe me, I really do.
But coffers are empty, guys.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.062
It's funny how you guys
are always flush

15:33.106 --> 15:34.455
when you talk with Wall Street,

15:34.498 --> 15:37.110
and then with us,
times are always tough.

15:37.153 --> 15:38.502
I am not making this up.

15:38.546 --> 15:40.678
I told our investors
the same thing this morning

15:40.722 --> 15:42.854
on our earnings call.
- That's true, actually.

15:42.898 --> 15:44.421
You can hear online.

15:44.465 --> 15:47.337
Just not sure if this is the
livestream or the recording.

15:47.381 --> 15:50.123
<i>Katherine's $20 million</i> <i>
bonus isn't even that much,</i>

15:50.166 --> 15:51.559
<i>given how profitable...</i>
- Oh, God.

15:51.602 --> 15:53.039
<i>Payne has been</i> <i>
over the past year.</i>

15:53.082 --> 15:54.301
<i>She could have asked for more.</i>

15:54.344 --> 15:57.173
Yeah, no, that's--
that was the livestream.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.523
Whoops.

15:59.567 --> 16:01.090
Hey, Jin.

16:01.134 --> 16:02.439
Remember how,
several months ago,

16:02.483 --> 16:04.006
we had that conversation

16:04.050 --> 16:06.139
about how I plan to sell
a bunch of stocks

16:06.182 --> 16:07.923
on the day
of our next earnings call

16:07.967 --> 16:09.751
regardless of how
the company was doing?

16:09.794 --> 16:11.057
I don't remember that at all.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.363
Please remember, Jin, please.

16:13.407 --> 16:15.931
Obviously,
I meant mute us.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.498
They were already on mute.

16:17.541 --> 16:20.283
You cannot mute someone
who's already on mute.

16:20.327 --> 16:22.372
I mean, that is an oxymoron.

16:22.416 --> 16:23.591
- You mean it's redundant.
- You know what?

16:23.634 --> 16:26.333
You've been of no help
to me today, Jin.

16:26.376 --> 16:28.552
Okay, if you're out here,
who's keeping the call going?

16:28.596 --> 16:29.989
Wesley.

16:30.032 --> 16:31.033
Can't get any worse.

16:31.077 --> 16:32.556
Louis C.K. was literally

16:32.600 --> 16:34.645
the greatest comedian
of our time.

16:34.689 --> 16:37.213
And you all like to hate him,
but you know what?

16:37.257 --> 16:39.650
You all used to love him.

16:39.694 --> 16:41.043
<i>We would go bankrupt</i>

16:41.087 --> 16:42.610
if we give them
everything on this list.

16:42.653 --> 16:44.090
Okay, what about some sort
of sweetener,

16:44.133 --> 16:46.092
like a Taco Tuesday
or Hot Dog Wednesdays?

16:46.135 --> 16:48.572
I think they just want things
like dental.

16:48.616 --> 16:50.226
Right, yeah, but they're not
gonna say no to hot dogs.

16:50.270 --> 16:51.575
- People love hot dogs.
- Yeah.

16:51.619 --> 16:52.924
I'm sorry,
I'll be right back.

16:52.968 --> 16:54.230
- People love hot dogs.
- Yeah, they do, but--

16:54.274 --> 16:55.536
What about Funny Hat Day?
Funny Hat Day.

16:55.579 --> 16:57.494
I like that.

16:57.538 --> 16:58.756
Hey, man.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.149
I told you that stuff
about vacation days

17:00.193 --> 17:02.238
as a friend,
not so you could screw us over.

17:02.282 --> 17:04.240
I know,
and I'm sorry,

17:04.284 --> 17:06.590
but it's my job
to look out for my guys,

17:06.634 --> 17:08.070
even when that means
screwing over management.

17:08.114 --> 17:10.333
Me? I'm not management.

17:11.160 --> 17:12.857
- No?
- No, no.

17:12.901 --> 17:14.772
I mean, I don't even think
I'm in the payroll system yet.

17:14.816 --> 17:17.036
Technically, I think
I'm, like, an intern?

17:17.079 --> 17:18.733
Look, Jack,
you're a nice guy.

17:18.776 --> 17:21.040
But in the end,
you're gonna have to decide

17:21.083 --> 17:24.086
whether you live on land
or in the water.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.522
You can't be both.

17:29.874 --> 17:31.702
<i>What if you were</i> <i>
in a Woody Allen movie</i>

17:31.746 --> 17:33.443
and you worked really hard
to get there

17:33.487 --> 17:35.489
and you did a nice job
and you didn't do the stuff

17:35.532 --> 17:37.882
that Woody Allen did--
you didn't do that stuff--

17:37.926 --> 17:40.972
would you want people to just
stop watching your movies?

17:41.016 --> 17:42.626
I don't think so.

17:45.151 --> 17:47.196
Okay,
so we're up to four extra days,

17:47.240 --> 17:48.415
extra dollar per hour base pay,

17:48.458 --> 17:50.417
more flexible maternity leave.

17:50.460 --> 17:51.374
Yeah, Hot Dog Wednesdays.

17:51.418 --> 17:52.462
Yes. Come on, guys.

17:52.506 --> 17:54.247
This is
a really generous offer.

17:54.290 --> 17:55.639
There's nothing left to give.

17:59.295 --> 18:01.210
Sorry,
if that's all you've got,

18:01.254 --> 18:02.472
then I think we're done here.

18:02.516 --> 18:04.039
Good luck with the rest
of your call.

18:07.303 --> 18:08.435
Yeah.

18:08.478 --> 18:09.784
Good luck with elections
next month.

18:09.827 --> 18:11.742
Really hope you all
keep your jobs.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.093
What's that supposed to mean?

18:14.136 --> 18:16.617
It's just that these
are pretty sweet jobs,

18:16.660 --> 18:18.140
sitting around
while everybody on the line

18:18.184 --> 18:19.272
works their asses off.

18:19.315 --> 18:20.969
And if they found out
how you passed

18:21.012 --> 18:23.058
on four extra vacation days,
better pay,

18:23.102 --> 18:25.843
and Hot Dog Wednesdays...

18:25.887 --> 18:26.975
You really might find yourself

18:27.018 --> 18:28.019
back on the line
with the rest of them.

18:28.063 --> 18:29.151
But, you know,
I'm still friends

18:29.195 --> 18:30.457
with a lot of those guys.

18:30.500 --> 18:31.762
I can check in with them,
see what they think.

18:31.806 --> 18:33.112
Now, why would you do
something like that?

18:33.155 --> 18:35.070
I don't know.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.028
Guess I'm not
a mermaid anymore.

18:37.768 --> 18:38.813
What--what is he
talking about?

18:38.856 --> 18:40.336
Oh, God, it's just
this weird thing.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.947
They're all obsessed with
"The Little Mermaid."

18:42.991 --> 18:44.471
And you could put up
all the smoke and mirrors

18:44.514 --> 18:45.646
that you want.

18:45.689 --> 18:48.083
We all know Adnan did it.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.781
Adnan is guilty.

18:50.825 --> 18:52.740
And don't get me started
on "Tiger King."

18:52.783 --> 18:55.221
Carole Baskin,
I'm coming for you.

18:55.264 --> 18:57.048
You didn't have to do that
to that man.

18:57.092 --> 18:58.528
What happened?

18:58.572 --> 19:00.182
What happened is that
everything almost fell apart

19:00.226 --> 19:01.401
until psycho killer here

19:01.444 --> 19:03.359
stepped in
and just demolished them.

19:03.403 --> 19:05.666
Seriously? Yes, Jackknife.

19:05.709 --> 19:08.103
No, I really,
really did not do that much.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.018
No, this guy has ice
in his veins.

19:10.061 --> 19:11.672
I mean, no soul,

19:11.715 --> 19:13.500
and I mean that
in the best possible way.

19:13.543 --> 19:15.023
Yeah, he was a sniper.

19:15.066 --> 19:16.938
I was kinda like the guy
who guards the door

19:16.981 --> 19:18.896
behind the sniper
to protect him.

19:18.940 --> 19:21.072
You know, sniper can't do
his job without that guy.

19:21.116 --> 19:25.120
So it's kind of an important
part that people often forget.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.730
- Hmm.
- So is that call still going?

19:26.774 --> 19:28.254
Yeah,
let's announce this baby.

19:28.297 --> 19:30.734
All right, huh.
What a day it's been, right?

19:30.778 --> 19:32.258
Well, I wanna thank you all
for listening.

19:32.301 --> 19:35.261
And before I go,
a little drumroll, please.

19:35.304 --> 19:38.351
I am excited to announce
that we have finalized

19:38.394 --> 19:40.135
a new labor contract.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.876
So little cherry
on the sundae for you there.

19:41.919 --> 19:44.095
Thank you all again, and we
will see you next quarter.

19:44.139 --> 19:45.488
Oh, we just got a question

19:45.532 --> 19:47.055
from an analyst at JP Morgan.

19:47.098 --> 19:49.231
- Same guy as before?
- No, that was Morgan Stanley.

19:49.275 --> 19:51.102
Lot of Morgans. <i></i>

19:51.146 --> 19:52.887
<i>Ms. Hastings,</i> <i>
wasn't the labor contract</i>

19:52.930 --> 19:55.281
<i>almost finalized</i> <i>
before you joined Payne?</i>

19:55.324 --> 19:57.370
<i>That's not your big</i> <i>
announcement, is it?</i>

19:57.413 --> 19:59.459
Uh, no. No.

19:59.502 --> 20:01.330
The big announcement, no.
It was more of just good news.

20:01.374 --> 20:03.985
It was kind of an appetizer
to the main--

20:04.028 --> 20:06.074
you know, to the main course
kind of a situation.

20:06.117 --> 20:09.469
And so that main course is--
another drumroll,

20:09.512 --> 20:12.080
a bigger drumroll here--

20:12.123 --> 20:15.866
we are going into production
on the Payne Pika,

20:15.910 --> 20:19.957
and it will be retailing
for--wait for it--$10,000.

20:20.001 --> 20:21.959
- Um--
- Little early Christmas there.

20:22.003 --> 20:23.918
All right, thank you
so very much to you all.

20:23.961 --> 20:27.051
And God bless you, and also
God bless America as well.

20:27.095 --> 20:29.053
Mm-mm. <i></i>

20:29.097 --> 20:30.229
We're clear.

20:33.319 --> 20:35.930
Hey, Steve, Steve.

20:35.973 --> 20:36.757
Hey.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.237
Sorry about before.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.847
It wasn't personal,
but it all worked out, right?

20:39.890 --> 20:42.153
Sorry.
I don't mingle with management.

20:50.074 --> 20:53.034
- Rough day?
- Not the best.

20:53.077 --> 20:56.124
You?
- I've had better.

20:56.167 --> 20:57.821
Buy you a smoothie? My treat.

20:58.692 --> 21:01.042
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

21:03.697 --> 21:05.612
This is just a smoothie,
though.

21:05.655 --> 21:07.483
I don't want you getting
the wrong idea.

21:07.527 --> 21:09.355
Got it. I won't.

21:09.398 --> 21:11.139
Not putting out.

21:11.182 --> 21:15.926
Nope, this is just
a friend/coworker smoothie.

21:15.970 --> 21:17.319
That is it.
- You're very close

21:17.363 --> 21:18.625
to getting no boba.

21:18.668 --> 21:20.670
- They got boba?
- Yeah.

21:20.714 --> 21:22.977
Things just got
very interesting.
