00:02.570 --> 00:05.266
*

00:10.170 --> 00:13.139
MAN:
28,000 feet,
73-miIe-an-hour winds.

00:13.180 --> 00:16.069
The South Col.

00:16.110 --> 00:18.078
500 climbers all crowding
the same route

00:18.110 --> 00:19.816
in the one three-week period.

00:19.850 --> 00:22.341
It's a nightmare on Everest.

00:22.390 --> 00:23.812
That's Hillary Step.

00:23.850 --> 00:26.114
I shot this
just below the summit.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.809
There's always a bottleneck
waiting to use the ropes.

00:27.860 --> 00:31.785
A'I'I'ORNEY:
And that's where
Robert Lambros died?

00:31.830 --> 00:33.354
Yes.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.550
And that's
his body there?

00:35.600 --> 00:38.398
Yes. He was a guide.

00:38.430 --> 00:39.829
One of the members

00:39.870 --> 00:42.407
of his party collapsed and
died above Hillary Step,

00:42.440 --> 00:46.331
and Bobby stayed to help,
and then succumbed, too.

00:47.810 --> 00:49.072
I'm sorry.

00:49.110 --> 00:50.646
I liked your brother.

00:50.680 --> 00:53.114
You okay?

00:53.150 --> 00:54.048
A'I'I'ORNEY:
Now, regarding
his book--

00:54.080 --> 00:56.219
the defendant's book--
have you read it?

00:56.250 --> 00:57.649
I haye.
In It,
he claims

00:57.690 --> 00:58.748
that my client,

00:58.790 --> 00:59.779
Mr. Oliver Cardiff,

00:59.820 --> 01:02.220
came upon the dying
Robert Lambros, and not only

01:02.260 --> 01:04.353
stepped over his body
to get to the summit,

01:04.390 --> 01:05.755
but then took
his bottled owgen.

01:05.790 --> 01:07.792
You're aware
of that accusation?
I am.

01:07.830 --> 01:09.593
And do you disagree?
I do. I was

01:09.630 --> 01:11.188
climbing Everest
for a documentary,

01:11.230 --> 01:13.733
and I saw Mr. Cardiff here

01:13.770 --> 01:15.761
climbing with a British team.

01:15.800 --> 01:18.132
And this is below
the Hillary Steps?
Uh, Step.

01:18.170 --> 01:19.398
Yes.

01:19.440 --> 01:22.204
So, Mr. Cardiff couldn't
have been near Lambros.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.275
He was lower on the
mountain, heading up?

01:24.310 --> 01:25.447
Yes, that would follow.

01:25.480 --> 01:27.141
So, this book is untrue?

01:28.920 --> 01:30.888
especially a friend, but

01:30.920 --> 01:33.184
Danny was at base camp
and didn't see what I saw.

01:33.220 --> 01:34.858
A'I'I'ORNEY:
No further questions.

01:34.890 --> 01:37.484
Nothing personal, but I have
to rip your friend apart.

01:37.530 --> 01:39.498
Be gentle.

01:39.530 --> 01:43.193
Mr. Branch,
what is the death zone?

01:43.230 --> 01:45.221
The death zone?

01:45.270 --> 01:47.238
In mountaineering parlance,

01:47.270 --> 01:49.568
it's the altitude
above 26,000 feet

01:49.610 --> 01:51.430
where owgen is insufficient
to sustain life.

01:51.470 --> 01:52.835
It's also a place

01:52.880 --> 01:55.235
where perceptions are not
to be fully trusted?

01:55.280 --> 01:57.305
Sometimes.
You believe

01:57.350 --> 02:00.319
that bottled owgen has hurt
the sport of mountain climbing,

02:00.350 --> 02:01.874
so you climb without owgen?

02:01.920 --> 02:03.512
I do.

02:03.550 --> 02:06.485
And an absence of oxygen
would increase the likelihood

02:06.520 --> 02:08.385
of untrustworthy perceptions?

02:08.420 --> 02:10.559
Yes.

02:10.590 --> 02:12.558
So, when you say

02:12.600 --> 02:14.249
that you saw
the plaintiff

02:14.300 --> 02:17.189
below the Hillary Step, we
have to take your word for it,

02:17.230 --> 02:18.390
and yet your word could

02:18.430 --> 02:21.763
be colored by your
oxygen-deprived perception.

02:21.800 --> 02:25.736
I believe... that follows.

02:25.770 --> 02:27.328
Your Honor,
I'd like to make a motion

02:27.380 --> 02:28.733
at this time
to dismiss this lawsuit.

02:28.780 --> 02:31.704
This is a libel suit,
not a criminal case.

02:31.750 --> 02:33.479
The plaintiff needs
not only to prove

02:33.520 --> 02:36.717
that my client's book was wrong,
but that he knew it was wrong.

02:36.750 --> 02:38.217
Which we're doing.
No. There is

02:38.250 --> 02:40.252
too much inherent
uncertainty here.

02:40.290 --> 02:42.952
This is a case built
on perception, and

02:42.990 --> 02:44.924
the death _zone makes_
those perceptions essentially

02:44.960 --> 02:47.292
suspect.

02:47.330 --> 02:49.321
(indistinct conversations)

02:50.570 --> 02:53.289
Wow. He dismissed.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.296
I'm... I'm stunned.

02:55.340 --> 02:56.807
Me, too.

02:56.840 --> 02:57.966
Thank you.

02:58.010 --> 02:59.272
Oh.

03:01.510 --> 03:03.649
The thought of him leaving
my brother behind and then

03:03.680 --> 03:05.375
suing me for everything...

03:05.410 --> 03:07.412
I know. It's over.
(cell phone rings)

03:07.450 --> 03:08.872
Hi, Eli.

03:08.920 --> 03:11.218
ELI:
Where are you?
The meeting's in ten minutes.

03:11.250 --> 03:12.854
And what meeting was that again?

03:12.890 --> 03:14.653
Okay, don't tease.
I'm not in the mood.

03:14.690 --> 03:16.658
I'm heading back there now.
30 minutes.

03:16.690 --> 03:18.351
(phone beeps off)

03:24.670 --> 03:26.262
Mickey, there you are.

03:26.300 --> 03:27.494
Hey.

03:27.540 --> 03:28.859
Any trouble?
No.

03:28.900 --> 03:30.606
Took the elevator
to the 3lst floor,

03:30.640 --> 03:32.870
walked on down,
nobody saw me.

03:32.910 --> 03:34.730
You look like crap.

03:34.780 --> 03:36.543
Thanks. This way.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.671
WILL:
Who was that?

03:40.720 --> 03:42.881
No idea.

03:42.920 --> 03:45.741
Do you ever get the feeling
we're losing control here?

03:45.790 --> 03:47.781
Every day.

03:47.820 --> 03:51.358
The state's attorney can hire
any law firm he wants

03:51.390 --> 03:54.029
to handle all civil cases
against his department.

03:54.060 --> 03:57.268
Glenn Childs had
Brimly, Tully & Snider.

03:57.300 --> 03:59.291
God, I hated them.

03:59.340 --> 04:02.434
Peter Florrick fired them and is
looking for new out5ide counsel.

04:02.470 --> 04:04.335
It's $20 million

04:04.370 --> 04:05.769
a year in new business.

04:05.810 --> 04:07.368
Florrick will never hire us.

04:07.410 --> 04:08.832
It's his wife's firm,

04:08.880 --> 04:10.040
his campaign manager's firm.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.741
Whic_h works
against us.

04:11.780 --> 04:13.577
He doesn't want it to look
like a sweetheart deal.

04:13.620 --> 04:15.611
We've been invited in to pitch.

04:23.490 --> 04:24.855
How many firms
have been invited?

04:24.890 --> 04:26.721
Eight.

04:27.730 --> 04:29.766
Then you should pitch.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.768
We should pitch.

04:31.800 --> 04:33.290
No.

04:33.340 --> 04:34.864
Is there something
I should know?

04:34.900 --> 04:36.299
About?

04:36.340 --> 04:38.661
I just don't want
to be blindsided.

04:38.710 --> 04:41.372
Have you noticed
you're turning into me?

04:41.410 --> 04:43.446
All the sports metaphors.

04:43.480 --> 04:44.708
A better version of you.

04:44.750 --> 04:45.899
MICKEY:
How the hell

04:45.950 --> 04:50.341
is it I can love a new car smell
but hate a new office one?

04:50.390 --> 04:51.311
'Cause a car
means fun,

04:51.350 --> 04:53.386
and an office, work.

04:53.420 --> 04:55.308
You getting laid,
anyways?
Me?

04:55.360 --> 04:57.351
No. You?

04:57.390 --> 04:58.755
Not since the summer of '08.

04:58.790 --> 05:01.350
So, you're the flavor
of the month these days

05:01.400 --> 05:03.368
in crisis managers.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.526
What happened with Weiner?

05:04.570 --> 05:05.992
Thought you'd be
on that one.

05:06.030 --> 05:08.430
Oh, God, the day politicians
discovered Twitter...

05:08.470 --> 05:09.869
(chuckles)

05:09.910 --> 05:12.401
I hear you're the flavor of
the month in strategists.

05:12.440 --> 05:13.429
What campaign
are you on?

05:13.480 --> 05:15.471
Uh...

05:16.510 --> 05:18.603
(door closes)

05:20.150 --> 05:21.617
I need your help.

05:21.650 --> 05:24.346
But I can't tell you
who this help is for.

05:24.390 --> 05:25.516
Okay.
I've been hired by

05:25.550 --> 05:27.814
a candidate who's setting up
an exploratory committee.

05:27.860 --> 05:29.418
For what?
I can't tell you.

05:29.460 --> 05:32.554
But he's got a problem.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.454
A real problem.
Financial
or sexual?

05:34.500 --> 05:36.491
Uh, I can't
tell you.
Oh, come on, Mickey.

05:36.530 --> 05:39.067
You want me to crisis manage
a crisis you can't tell me?

05:39.100 --> 05:40.032
This guy wants
options, okay?

05:40.070 --> 05:42.402
He wants to know
this scandal can be handled

05:42.440 --> 05:44.658
if he chooses to run,
but he doesn't want the scandal

05:44.710 --> 05:46.632
to get out
if he chooses not to run.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.874
This is BS.

05:47.910 --> 05:49.741
It's like a bake-off
without any ingredients.

05:49.780 --> 05:51.441
Buyer's market, Eli.

05:51.480 --> 05:53.414
If you choose not to play,
there are others who will.

05:53.450 --> 05:55.839
Now, I'm meeting
with three crisis managers.

05:55.880 --> 05:58.144
Whoever's got the best play,
that's who we're going with.

05:58.190 --> 06:00.454
Alicia, I'd like you to meet
a good friend, Mickey Gunn.

06:00.490 --> 06:01.286
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

06:01.320 --> 06:02.685
You got Saint Alicia
on your team.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.857
I'll hear from
you by Thursday, buddy.

06:04.890 --> 06:06.892
Hi.

06:08.960 --> 06:11.167
(door closes)

06:11.200 --> 06:13.566
That was the big meeting?

06:13.600 --> 06:15.033
Who's the investigator here?

06:15.070 --> 06:17.607
Kalinda Sharma. Why?

06:17.640 --> 06:19.938
I need her to investigate
a scandal before it happens.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.936
CARDIFF:
Mrs. Florrick.

06:21.980 --> 06:23.948
Hello.

06:23.980 --> 06:25.709
Hi.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.448
Are you here to see someone?

06:29.490 --> 06:31.446
Yes, you.

06:31.490 --> 06:32.411
James Thrush.

06:32.460 --> 06:33.688
Very pleased to meet you.

06:33.720 --> 06:35.688
And you.

06:35.720 --> 06:37.927
How may I help you?

06:37.960 --> 06:39.928
Do you know the
key distinction

06:39.960 --> 06:43.566
_ between the libel laws
in your country and mine?

06:43.600 --> 06:45.727
Burden of proof
is reversed.

06:45.770 --> 06:47.965
In America, it is up
to the person libeled

06:48.000 --> 06:49.467
to prove the
accusations against them

06:49.510 --> 06:51.865
are either knowingly
or recklessly false.

06:51.910 --> 06:54.708
In England, it is up to
the person libeling--

06:54.740 --> 06:56.970
your writing client,
Mr. Lambros--

06:57.010 --> 06:58.602
to prove what
he says is true.

06:58.650 --> 07:00.811
This is already
adjudicated, Mr. Cardiff.

07:00.850 --> 07:02.112
CARDIFF:
Yes.

07:02.150 --> 07:05.540
In the United States.
Danny didn't sell
any books in England.

07:05.590 --> 07:06.659
Actually, I'm afraid he did.

07:06.690 --> 07:08.055
This, in fact, is one.

07:08.090 --> 07:09.626
Purchased not two weeks ago

07:09.660 --> 07:11.480
from your wonderful
Internet site, Amazon.

07:11.530 --> 07:12.451
You can't...
Actually,

07:12.500 --> 07:13.819
I'm afraid I can.

07:13.860 --> 07:16.021
I am a Queen's Counsel of
the Royal Courts of Justice,

07:16.060 --> 07:20.963
and this is a writ of
new proceedings for libel.

07:22.540 --> 07:25.509
You had this ready
tor the day you lost.

07:25.540 --> 07:27.531
THRUSH:
Mr. Cardiff wished to exhaust
the American courts first.

07:27.580 --> 07:29.605
You're going after the wrong
man-- Danny did nothing wrong.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.208
He accused me of
killing his brother.

07:31.250 --> 07:32.672
He ruined my reputation.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.075
Read the charge.

07:35.120 --> 07:37.008
I am suing him
for 20 million

07:37.050 --> 07:39.484
He's not rich.
He doesn't have your money.

07:39.520 --> 07:41.909
Oh, let's not make this a
classist issue, shall we?

07:41.960 --> 07:43.188
I know he's not rich.

07:43.230 --> 07:46.597
Now he'll be poor.

07:59.810 --> 08:02.233
(elevator bell dings)

08:02.280 --> 08:04.077
ALICIA:
Mr. Ash Brannon?

08:04.110 --> 08:05.509
So sorry to keep you waiting.

08:05.550 --> 08:06.676
I'm Alicia Florrick.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.676
Yes. Hello. Um, sorry.

08:08.720 --> 08:10.847
Florrick? Right. Two Rs?

08:10.890 --> 08:12.118
Yes.
Right.

08:12.150 --> 08:14.015
Uh, come with me.
Certainly.

08:14.060 --> 08:16.210
Filial air crock.

08:16.260 --> 08:17.989
Excuse me?

08:18.030 --> 08:19.156
It's an anagram.

08:19.190 --> 08:20.691
Sorry. It's a
nervous habit. Sorry.

08:20.730 --> 08:22.027
Okay.

08:22.060 --> 08:25.029
Um, so you are the barrister
that Danny hired.

08:25.070 --> 08:26.628
Is that correct?

08:26.670 --> 08:27.989
Actually, no.
The solicitor.

08:28.040 --> 08:30.634
No, not as posh as a
barrister, but we try harder.

08:30.670 --> 08:31.807
(chuckles, clears
his throat)

08:31.840 --> 08:32.977
Sorry, I'm a bit punchy.

08:33.010 --> 08:34.568
Just, uh, first
trip to the States.

08:34.610 --> 08:35.929
You know, just
off the plane.

08:35.980 --> 08:37.106
Where are the
Olsen twins?

08:37.150 --> 08:38.003
(laughs) Where?

08:38.050 --> 08:40.268
Would you like a
cup of coffee? Will!
Hi.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.208
This is Mr. Timothy
Ash Brannon.

08:42.250 --> 08:43.945
Oh, yes, the barrister.
Will Gardner.

08:43.990 --> 08:46.015
Actually, solicitor.
No, thank you on the coffee.

08:46.050 --> 08:47.256
Oh, okay.
Warden Grill.

08:50.060 --> 08:52.028
Anagrams.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.625
BRANNON:
It's not a deposition.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.126
It's a letter rogatory.

08:58.170 --> 08:59.159
And that's?

08:59.200 --> 09:00.758
Well, basically,
it's a, uh...

09:00.800 --> 09:03.337
It's a deposition.

09:03.370 --> 09:05.668
Evidence given before a trial.

09:05.710 --> 09:08.008
The witnesses are
primarily in America,

09:08.040 --> 09:10.679
so his lordship has agreed to
allow it to be videotaped here.

09:10.710 --> 09:13.110
Good, then we try to get
this kicked before trial.

09:13.150 --> 09:13.514
ALICIA:
Or we stall it.

09:13.550 --> 09:15.074
Stall what?

09:15.120 --> 09:17.008
Cardiff doesn't need the money
from this suit.

09:17.050 --> 09:19.041
He wants the publicity.
That's why he's expediting this.

09:19.090 --> 09:20.114
So? We can't just sit back.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.081
We get this kicked,

09:21.120 --> 09:22.280
there won't be
any publicity.

09:22.320 --> 09:23.787
But the burden of proof works
against us now.

09:24.830 --> 09:25.979
that Danny's
book is true.

09:26.030 --> 09:27.327
Which we can't do.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.265
We can't stall.

09:30.300 --> 09:31.892
My wife's house--
it's in Toronto.

09:31.930 --> 09:32.828
My business, too.

09:32.870 --> 09:34.235
Ah.

09:34.270 --> 09:35.931
Canadais
a British Commonwealth.

09:35.970 --> 09:37.699
They froze your assets?

09:37.740 --> 09:39.037
Yes.

09:39.070 --> 09:41.038
What was your strategy in court?

09:41.080 --> 09:43.105
Show there could be no certainty
about the events on Everest.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.139
Therefore,
there could be no libel.

09:44.180 --> 09:46.648
Well, that strategy
just went out the window.

09:46.680 --> 09:47.840
What do we have?

09:47.880 --> 09:49.916
To prove Cardiff
took Lambros's oxygen?

09:49.950 --> 09:52.089
Well nothing.
The goal wasn't to prove it.

09:52.120 --> 09:53.348
Can we, though?
Can we prove it?

09:54.390 --> 09:57.052
What about the satellite call?

09:57.090 --> 09:58.921
Robert talked to his wife

09:58.960 --> 10:00.757
from his satellite phone
just before he died.

10:00.800 --> 10:01.926
We never needed the tape.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.325
I'm on it.

10:05.370 --> 10:07.338
Are you the investigator?

10:07.370 --> 10:09.167
Iam.

10:09.200 --> 10:10.337
Do you have a minute?

10:10.370 --> 10:12.201
Do you want me to have a minute?

10:12.240 --> 10:13.673
So there's

10:13.710 --> 10:14.870
a scandal of some kind,

10:14.910 --> 10:17.003
but you don't know who
or what it is?

10:17.050 --> 10:19.245
Yes. Can you find out?
How does this work

10:19.280 --> 10:20.372
when I investigate for you?

10:20.420 --> 10:22.217
I have no idea.

10:22.250 --> 10:23.217
But you are one
of my bosses now?

10:23.250 --> 10:26.185
Yes. I think so.

10:26.220 --> 10:29.849
You probably invoice
in some way.

10:29.890 --> 10:31.858
I have to pitch
to a campaign manager

10:31.890 --> 10:34.029
on Thursday
on how to manage a scandal,

10:34.060 --> 10:36.324
but he's afraid
the scandal will be exposed,

10:36.360 --> 10:37.896
so he won't give me
any information,

10:37.930 --> 10:39.898
and I need that information
to pitch.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.760
Do you want
to sit down?
No.

10:41.800 --> 10:44.234
You want the information
so he's forced

10:44.270 --> 10:46.033
to hire you, or
you'll expose it?

10:47.080 --> 10:49.401
How have I never met you before?

10:49.440 --> 10:51.704
We move in different circles.

10:52.750 --> 10:54.741
PETER:
Sorry about that.

10:54.780 --> 10:57.180
It's amazing how my life
has gone from no calls

10:57.220 --> 10:59.279
to a call sheet of 85 a day.

10:59.320 --> 11:01.151
Yes, it's quite a change--

11:01.190 --> 11:03.055
from prison back to
the state's attorney's office.

11:03.090 --> 11:04.182
How you doing?

11:04.230 --> 11:06.186
I love it. _
I really love it.

11:06.230 --> 11:08.698
You don't mind if Cary
sits in on this, do you?

11:08.730 --> 11:10.061
No, not at all.

11:10.100 --> 11:11.294
Hi, Cary.
Diane.

11:11.330 --> 11:15.334
He gives me insight into all
the Lockhart/Gardner matters.

11:15.370 --> 11:18.965
So you guys are
the survivors.

11:19.010 --> 11:20.875
Of the economy.

11:20.910 --> 11:22.377
I looked at the roll
of Chicago firms

11:22.410 --> 11:24.173
since I was last in this seat.

11:24.210 --> 11:25.871
They're practically all gone.

11:25.910 --> 11:29.141
Well, there's been some tough
times, but we're fighters.

11:29.180 --> 11:30.909
Well, you've beaten us
a few times.

11:30.950 --> 11:33.214
No hard feelings?
Uh...

11:33.260 --> 11:34.318
(laughing)
Hey, that's
the reason

11:34.360 --> 11:36.351
you're in that seat.

11:36.390 --> 11:39.928
We're hiring an outside
caretaker for our civil cases--

11:39.960 --> 11:42.155
lawsuits against
County Hospital, the police

11:42.200 --> 11:44.065
or SA's office--

11:44.100 --> 11:46.261
and we need to decide
between three firms.

11:46.300 --> 11:48.165
Really?
I thought there were eight.

11:48.200 --> 11:49.167
There were.
We whittled it down.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.064
I'm honored.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.362
The only problem is,
we have some concerns.

11:52.410 --> 11:54.230
If it's about Alicia
and Eli Gold,

11:54.280 --> 11:57.169
we've established a Chinese wall
between their work

11:57.210 --> 11:58.370
and SA business.
No, no, no.

11:58.410 --> 11:59.775
I'm not going to
reject a law firm

11:59.820 --> 12:01.219
because it might look
bad to the public.

12:01.250 --> 12:02.911
Lemond Bishop.

12:04.050 --> 12:05.278
The drug dealer.

12:05.320 --> 12:07.982
We only handle
his legitimate business.

12:08.020 --> 12:09.282
And I'm _sure
youWIﬁnd

12:09.320 --> 12:11.459
that every major law firm

12:11.490 --> 12:14.459
_ has a few _
potentially unsavory clients.

12:14.500 --> 12:19.369
We have to have some assurances
that your money isn't tainted.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.197
Is that a fair word?

12:21.240 --> 12:22.366
It is.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.504
Diane, look,
I'm running a new office,

12:24.540 --> 12:27.270
and I know that every
state's attorney says that--

12:27.310 --> 12:29.335
I said it my first term--

12:29.380 --> 12:31.177
but this time, it's different.

12:31.210 --> 12:33.815
Now, you're one of three law
firms that I'm considering

12:33.850 --> 12:35.078
to hire as my attorney.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.145
I need to know
that you're clean.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.340
So we just need you
to voluntarily submit

12:39.390 --> 12:43.019
to an audit by the Illinois
State Department of Taxation.

12:43.060 --> 12:46.029
And that won't violate
attorney-client prIVIlege.

12:46.060 --> 12:48.426
It gives me an
independent confirmation

12:48.460 --> 12:51.463
that your hands are
free of drug money.

12:51.500 --> 12:54.469
You're asking us to voluntarily
submit to an audit?

12:54.500 --> 12:55.990
Yes.

12:56.040 --> 12:57.507
If you want the job.

12:59.270 --> 13:01.374
Well, uh, that's significant.

13:01.410 --> 13:03.378
I'll need to talk to my partner.

13:03.410 --> 13:04.570
Of course.

13:04.610 --> 13:06.441
Will?
Yes.

13:06.480 --> 13:07.913
You two know each other,
don't you?

13:07.950 --> 13:09.440
We do.

13:09.480 --> 13:11.482
Why don't you bring him in
next time,

13:11.520 --> 13:13.909
and we'll all talk
about the possibility

13:13.960 --> 13:16.383
of, uh, making this all work?
(phone ringing)

13:16.420 --> 13:18.126
86th call.

13:18.160 --> 13:19.127
If you'll excuse me.

13:19.160 --> 13:21.128
Yeah.

13:21.160 --> 13:22.229
ZACH:
Hey, Dad.

13:22.260 --> 13:23.363
I'm coming over early
tomorrow night.

13:23.400 --> 13:24.469
At 8:00, okay?

13:24.500 --> 13:25.967
Okay.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.399
Is everything all right?

13:27.440 --> 13:29.499
Yeah, everything's fine.
I just wanted to come early.

13:29.540 --> 13:31.462
Okay, good.
Well, I'll make dinner.

13:31.510 --> 13:32.499
Um...

13:32.540 --> 13:35.270
Well, thanks for the vote
of confidence, Zach.

13:35.310 --> 13:37.175
(chuckles)

13:37.210 --> 13:38.905
I think it might be
more appropriate

13:38.950 --> 13:40.918
to respond, "Good morning."

13:40.950 --> 13:43.885
I understand the arguments
for "Good evening,"

13:43.920 --> 13:47.310
but the_court of record
is in London,

13:47.360 --> 13:51.456
not in the United States,
and as you can see,

13:51.490 --> 13:52.388
it is morning here.

13:52.430 --> 13:53.499
TH RUSH:
Your Lordship,
I will gladly defer.

13:53.530 --> 13:55.589
Good morning to all.

13:55.630 --> 13:58.269
And good evening to you,
Mr. Thrush.

13:58.300 --> 14:01.463
Who_is the barrister
representing the respondent?

14:01.500 --> 14:04.207
A solicitor,
Your Lordship.

14:04.240 --> 14:05.901
Uh, one Timothy O'Brannon.

14:05.940 --> 14:07.532
(clears throat)
Brannon, Your Lordship.

14:07.580 --> 14:08.604
N0 "O."

14:08.640 --> 14:09.868
Mr. Brannon,

14:09.910 --> 14:11.901
are there any applications

14:11.950 --> 14:13.372
to the court before we commence?

14:13.420 --> 14:14.478
There are, Your Honor.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.544
Uh, Your Lordship.

14:15.580 --> 14:16.512
Your Lordship.

14:16.550 --> 14:18.882
This is a sham
of a lawsuit.

14:18.920 --> 14:21.150
It's libel tourism,
pure and simple.

14:21.190 --> 14:23.488
Rich plaintiffs
like Roman Polanski,

14:23.530 --> 14:25.452
Arnold Schwarzenegger
and Mr. Cardiff

14:25.490 --> 14:27.458
can't win their libel suits
in American courts,

14:27.500 --> 14:28.899
so they take them
to England.

14:30.430 --> 14:33.035
Sir, I understand your passion
in this matter,

14:33.070 --> 14:36.039
but I would ask you
to address this court

14:36.070 --> 14:38.163
with a greater degree
of restraint.

14:39.370 --> 14:41.008
I...

14:41.040 --> 14:42.405
Apologies, Your...

14:42.440 --> 14:43.475
(whispering):
Lordship.

14:43.510 --> 14:44.442
Lordship.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.641
That might be an artifact
of the Polycom.

14:46.680 --> 14:49.342
I merely wanted to
stress that there

14:49.380 --> 14:52.588
were only 18 copies
of our client's books

14:52.620 --> 14:54.087
sold in the
United Kingdom.

14:54.120 --> 14:55.519
They were all bought online,

14:55.560 --> 14:59.428
and they were all bought
by Mr. Cardiff's staff.

14:59.460 --> 15:01.257
As my learned colleague
well knows, Your Lordship,

15:01.300 --> 15:03.495
where and who purchased
these books is irrelevant.

15:03.530 --> 15:05.623
Excuse me. Mr. Cardiff
bought the books

15:05.670 --> 15:08.036
_ that he is now
bringing swt to here.

15:08.070 --> 15:11.460
Mr. Gardner, what are you doing?

15:13.410 --> 15:16.004
I... what am I doing?

15:16.040 --> 15:18.577
Your body.

15:19.980 --> 15:22.414
The disposition of your body.

15:22.450 --> 15:23.542
You turned your back
to the judge.

15:23.590 --> 15:24.682
Are you kidding me?
No. Look.

15:24.720 --> 15:26.585
Look, maybe you should
let me argue...

15:26.620 --> 15:28.383
Apologies, apologies,
Your Lordship.

15:28.420 --> 15:30.627
I am... I am new
to your court.

15:30.660 --> 15:34.448
We would argue
that your parliament

15:34.500 --> 15:36.695
is in the midst
of rewriting these libel laws

15:36.730 --> 15:40.598
to prevent exactly this type
of libel tourism.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.130
Your Lordship, parliament
was indeed considering

15:42.170 --> 15:45.105
revising these very laws
until Mr. Rupert Murdoch

15:45.140 --> 15:47.574
and his recent News of the World
contretemps.

15:47.610 --> 15:49.305
I would argue that
only 23 copies

15:49.340 --> 15:52.605
of Funding Evil were purchased
through the Internet,

15:52.650 --> 15:54.618
yet this court ordered
that book's destruction...

15:54.650 --> 15:56.515
I think you'd better
argue instead.

15:56.550 --> 15:58.188
The judge likes demure.

15:58.220 --> 16:00.552
Mr. Thrush made a fine point.
We will continue.

16:00.590 --> 16:03.024
IfI may, Your Lordship.

16:03.060 --> 16:04.322
Yes, Mr. O'Brannon.

16:04.360 --> 16:06.282
Uh, Brannon, Your Lordship.

16:06.330 --> 16:07.729
We ask the court's
indulgence

16:07.760 --> 16:10.069
in hearing evidence

16:10.100 --> 16:12.489
intended to refute
the applicant's charge.

16:12.530 --> 16:13.758
Proceed.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.495
ROBERT (over tape):
I love you.

16:15.540 --> 16:17.007
(wind whistling,
man panting over tape)

16:17.040 --> 16:19.008
I'm sorry.

16:19.040 --> 16:20.598
It's just so cold.

16:20.640 --> 16:22.301
WOMAN (over tape):
Bobby, do me a favor.

16:22.340 --> 16:23.307
Just get up.

16:23.350 --> 16:24.749
You can do it.

16:24.780 --> 16:26.748
Please.

16:26.780 --> 16:28.771
ROBERT:
I'm just so tired.

16:28.820 --> 16:30.788
WOMAN:
I know.

16:30.820 --> 16:31.741
Your son needs you, Bobby.

16:31.790 --> 16:33.109
He's here.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.388
He needs his father.

16:35.720 --> 16:37.278
Get up and walk.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.786
(tape stops)

16:38.830 --> 16:40.149
And this was your husband?

16:40.200 --> 16:41.497
(sniffles)
Yes.

16:42.730 --> 16:44.766
(clears throat)
He had a satellite phone.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.791
He called from the South Col.

16:46.830 --> 16:48.798
He always called at noon.

16:48.840 --> 16:50.307
And you recorded it?
Yes.

16:50.340 --> 16:52.558
I wanted his son
to remember him.

16:52.610 --> 16:54.601
(click, tape resumes playing)

16:54.640 --> 16:57.803
WOMAN:
Use the owgen, Bobby, please.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.000
And get up and walk.

17:02.220 --> 17:04.381
ROBERT:
Over here!

17:04.420 --> 17:06.081
Here!
WOMAN: Is someone there?

17:07.120 --> 17:08.348
Bobby!

17:08.390 --> 17:10.221
ROBERT:
It's the British team.

17:10.260 --> 17:12.148
(pants) Hold on.

17:12.190 --> 17:13.726
(tape stops)

17:13.760 --> 17:15.352
But they didn't stop for him.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.719
No.

17:16.760 --> 17:19.228
And they took
your husband's oxygen tank.

17:19.270 --> 17:21.158
Yes. I asked him to use

17:21.200 --> 17:23.703
his owgen tank,
but it was gone.

17:23.740 --> 17:27.574
No apology, no money.

17:27.610 --> 17:29.669
But we'll agree not to print
the book in Great Britain.

17:29.710 --> 17:31.507
(laughing)

17:34.420 --> 17:37.309
Very emotional in there.

17:37.350 --> 17:40.387
Nice touch using
the female lawyer.

17:40.420 --> 17:43.526
You Americans certainly
do enjoy your drama.

17:43.560 --> 17:46.085
So does His Lordship.
Did you see him?

17:46.890 --> 17:50.565
1.2 million and an apology.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.363
(laughing)

17:54.140 --> 17:55.539
So is this some of that famous

17:55.570 --> 17:56.730
stiff-upper-lip stuff
I've heard about?

17:56.770 --> 17:58.829
God, I do love you Yanks.

17:58.870 --> 18:01.634
You are so easy to distract.

18:01.680 --> 18:03.443
With our accents

18:03.480 --> 18:06.176
and our periwigs
and our tea and crumpets.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.814
And Benny Hill.
Don't forget Benny Hill.

18:07.850 --> 18:12.446
But I am not the England
of Big Ben and bobbies.

18:12.490 --> 18:17.189
I'm not the England of doilies
and cucumber sandwiches.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.425
I'm the England
of football hooligans

18:19.460 --> 18:21.121
and Jack the Ripper.

18:21.160 --> 18:22.855
(shivers, whimpers)

18:22.900 --> 18:24.197
And this England

18:24.230 --> 18:27.438
don't play nice,
and it don't play fair,

18:27.470 --> 18:31.509
and it don't ever stop.

18:32.910 --> 18:37.643
Here's some advice,
Mr., uh... Thrush.

18:37.680 --> 18:40.217
When you want
to intimidate someone,

18:40.250 --> 18:43.686
don't use so many words.

18:43.720 --> 18:46.689
Intimidation isn't a sonnet.

18:48.760 --> 18:49.681
(chuckles)

18:51.690 --> 18:55.524
It seems we understand
each other perfectly.

18:55.560 --> 18:57.619
Shall we?

19:26.860 --> 19:28.623
(camera shutter snaps)

19:31.930 --> 19:33.488
(camera shutter snaps)

19:33.540 --> 19:34.837
TH RUSH:
Mrs. Lambros,

19:34.870 --> 19:36.929
you used to be
a mountaineer yourself?

19:36.970 --> 19:38.961
Yes, until I became pregnant.

19:39.010 --> 19:39.806
And why did
you stop then?

19:39.840 --> 19:42.274
Why? I couldn't risk it
with a son.

19:42.310 --> 19:43.709
TH RUSH:
Yes, of course.

19:43.750 --> 19:46.207
Your husband kept climbing
after you gave birth?

19:46.250 --> 19:47.842
Yes. He was a guide.
It was his job.

19:47.880 --> 19:49.347
But he was
offered other

19:49.380 --> 19:50.938
climbing jobs
on less dangerous peaks.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.548
In the Alps, for instance.

19:53.820 --> 19:55.981
Don't need to answer that.
We understand.

19:56.020 --> 19:57.851
Tell me about
hypoxia.

19:57.890 --> 20:00.791
Uh, hypoxia is
an extreme form

20:00.830 --> 20:04.459
of owgen deprivation
prevalent at high altitudes.

20:04.500 --> 20:05.626
Thank you.

20:05.670 --> 20:07.558
Now, isn't one of the potential

20:07.600 --> 20:10.865
side effects of hypoxia
hallucinations?

20:13.580 --> 20:14.604
Potentially.

20:14.640 --> 20:15.709
TH RUSH:
Mrs. Lambros,

20:15.740 --> 20:17.742
I put it to you
that your husband

20:17.780 --> 20:18.906
was hallucinating on
that telephone call.

20:18.950 --> 20:20.872
I put it to you
that your husband

20:20.920 --> 20:21.978
saw what he
wished to see--

20:22.020 --> 20:23.715
the British team
coming to save him.

20:23.750 --> 20:24.978
ALICIA:
Oh, come on.

20:25.020 --> 20:25.987
You're kidding me.

20:26.020 --> 20:27.453
(chuckles)

20:27.490 --> 20:29.253
I beg your pardon.
You really think

20:29.290 --> 20:30.757
that Robert Lambros hallucinated

20:30.790 --> 20:32.428
Cardiff taking
his owgen tank?

20:32.460 --> 20:33.927
Really? How does
that work?

20:33.960 --> 20:34.927
Ithink, my I...

20:34.960 --> 20:36.291
Your Lordship, I...

20:36.330 --> 20:38.719
No, seriously,
how does he hallucinate

20:38.770 --> 20:41.364
the loss of his oxygen tank?

20:41.400 --> 20:43.732
It was my
contention that he

20:43.770 --> 20:46.364
hallucinated its existence
in the first place.

20:46.410 --> 20:47.877
If you're going
to blame the victim,

20:47.910 --> 20:49.332
at least use _
some better logic.

20:49.380 --> 20:51.007
Your Lordship, I object
to the tone that this...

20:51.050 --> 20:52.403
This what?

20:52.450 --> 20:54.441
This American lawyer?
Is that what you

20:54.480 --> 20:55.913
were going to say?
(Judge clears throat)

20:57.420 --> 20:59.741
Let us take a short break.

20:59.790 --> 21:02.315
Demure, huh?

21:02.360 --> 21:03.759
Change of plans.

21:03.790 --> 21:05.451
Mmm.

21:05.490 --> 21:09.392
I think I'm having
American Revolution fantasies.

21:09.430 --> 21:11.523
That turned me on.

21:11.570 --> 21:12.969
Mmm.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.991
Well, I can dress up.

21:16.870 --> 21:19.964
I want to take you now.

21:21.010 --> 21:23.069
Well, that might
prove difficult.

21:23.110 --> 21:25.499
Hmm.

21:25.550 --> 21:27.677
In my bathroom.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.540
Mm-hmm.

21:29.580 --> 21:31.639
We have ten minutes.

21:31.690 --> 21:33.715
I'll go first.

21:35.990 --> 21:38.288
Oh, Will, we're being watched.

21:39.560 --> 21:42.393
Where is that book? Hmm...

21:42.430 --> 21:43.727
To be continued.

21:43.770 --> 21:45.761
Mm-hmm.

21:52.810 --> 21:53.936
(sighs)
We can't do that.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.470
I know.

21:55.510 --> 21:57.603
He said it was about
Lemond Bishop.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.504
They wanted to make sure
none of our billing

21:59.550 --> 22:01.108
came from drug money.

22:01.150 --> 22:04.119
It's like putting a bull's-eye
on our back for the IRS.
I know.

22:04.150 --> 22:05.640
Do you think he's after us?

22:05.690 --> 22:06.816
Florrick?

22:06.850 --> 22:08.078
I don't know.

22:08.120 --> 22:11.123
Glenn Childs was this close
to a RICO charge.

22:11.160 --> 22:12.980
Maybe Florrick's
taking up the hunt.

22:13.030 --> 22:16.352
You really think he would
do that to his wife's firm?

22:19.130 --> 22:21.132
I think he's trying
to run a clean office.

22:21.170 --> 22:23.638
What if we offer
to open up our books

22:23.670 --> 22:25.865
to an independent
accounting firm?

22:25.910 --> 22:28.674
Florrick might just be looking
for a gesture like that.

22:28.710 --> 22:31.099
I think if he's serious,
it's worth a try.

22:31.150 --> 22:35.075
But let's not expose ourselves
on a subway platform

22:35.120 --> 22:36.610
unless we have to.

22:36.650 --> 22:38.515
Well, what a colorful
and pointless metaphor.

22:38.550 --> 22:39.687
Thank you.

22:39.720 --> 22:41.119
It's the Brits.

22:41.160 --> 22:43.116
I think I'm picking up
their accents.

22:43.160 --> 22:44.627
I noticed.

22:44.660 --> 22:45.888
It really classes up
the joint.

22:45.930 --> 22:49.559
KALINDA:
And here's Mr. Gunn meeting
outside of his office.

22:49.600 --> 22:53.127
And here...
is the SUV license plate.

22:53.170 --> 22:55.866
Here it is
drivmg away.

22:55.900 --> 22:59.131
And here is the occupant.

22:59.170 --> 23:01.536
Tsk. Harold Burke?
Yup.

23:01.580 --> 23:03.036
Ex-senator.

23:03.080 --> 23:04.900
Here's a photo of him

23:04.950 --> 23:06.474
with his family.

23:06.510 --> 23:07.545
Any whiff of a scandal?

23:07.580 --> 23:10.048
Here's the children's nanny.

23:10.080 --> 23:11.479
You're kidding.

23:11.520 --> 23:13.659
Here's a photo of
her leaving work.

23:13.690 --> 23:16.113
Here's a photo of Mr. Burke
leaving work.

23:17.660 --> 23:20.549
And here is a photo of them...

23:21.930 --> 23:23.659
...at their destination.

23:25.030 --> 23:26.497
Nicely done.

23:26.530 --> 23:28.669
Thanks.

23:28.700 --> 23:29.792
How do I know you?

23:29.840 --> 23:32.661
You don't.

23:32.710 --> 23:33.938
And yet, you look
so familiar.

23:33.980 --> 23:36.073
I just have one of those faces.

23:36.110 --> 23:37.998
I'll need you again.

23:38.050 --> 23:40.041
Then invoice.

23:45.890 --> 23:48.108
PETER:
Hey, Grace,
set the table, please.

23:51.490 --> 23:53.151
Dad.
Yeah?

23:53.190 --> 23:55.090
Why is Mom doing this?

23:55.130 --> 23:56.950
Doing what?

23:57.000 --> 23:59.468
Kicking you out.

24:02.800 --> 24:05.735
We were just getting
back to normal.

24:05.770 --> 24:07.067
I don't get it.

24:07.110 --> 24:09.772
What did your mom tell you?

24:09.810 --> 24:12.973
She said that she wanted
to make the marriage work,

24:13.010 --> 24:14.568
but it didn't.

24:18.920 --> 24:20.444
You don't kick someone out
for no reason.

24:22.290 --> 24:24.781
(sighs)

24:24.830 --> 24:27.185
I wasn't always
good to your mom, Zach.

24:27.230 --> 24:29.551
But that was a long time ago.

24:29.600 --> 24:30.919
And she stayed.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.961
It wasn't just...

24:37.770 --> 24:39.237
There were other things.

24:42.310 --> 24:43.675
What do you mean?

24:43.710 --> 24:44.870
I mean...

24:47.680 --> 24:49.944
I hurt your mom
with other things.

24:51.990 --> 24:54.254
With someone else?

24:58.960 --> 25:01.292
I think we should
just leave it at that.

25:01.330 --> 25:04.788
Dad, there's something wrong
with the computer.

25:04.830 --> 25:07.537
Okay. Let's have a look.

25:10.170 --> 25:12.536
So where are you from,
Mr. Brannon?

25:12.570 --> 25:14.071
I'm sorry,
where am I from?

25:14.110 --> 25:15.532
Yes. County Cork?
County Clare?

25:15.580 --> 25:17.673
Tipperary?

25:17.710 --> 25:19.849
Have a bit of an ear
for accents.

25:19.880 --> 25:22.610
I'm just trying
to place your Irish brogue.

25:22.650 --> 25:24.311
County Kerry.

25:24.350 --> 25:26.910
(Irish accent):
Ah, a bit of the old potato
famine emigration, was it?

25:26.950 --> 25:28.679
Well, fair play, lad.

25:28.720 --> 25:31.188
And good luck to you, me boy.

25:34.330 --> 25:35.319
(quietly):
What's his anagram?

25:35.360 --> 25:37.123
Jams her tush.

25:37.160 --> 25:39.219
(chuckles)

25:39.270 --> 25:42.330
There is this inbred deference
I have to greater rank.

25:42.370 --> 25:44.736
ALICIA:
Yeah, I know. Me, too.

25:44.770 --> 25:46.806
Really? You
don't seem so.

25:46.840 --> 25:48.330
I'm trying very hard
to change.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.608
Yeah.

25:49.640 --> 25:52.006
I'm not well-disposed
to change.

25:52.050 --> 25:54.917
No, me neither.

25:54.950 --> 25:56.247
Mandy Cox.

25:56.280 --> 25:58.089
I am a music executive
working in A&R.

25:58.120 --> 25:59.280
THRUSH:
Thank you, Ms. Cox.

25:59.320 --> 26:01.117
And you were intending
to summit Everest

26:01.160 --> 26:03.310
at the same time as
the events in question?

26:03.360 --> 26:04.327
Yes, sir.

26:04.360 --> 26:06.851
It's always been
a dream of mine.

26:06.890 --> 26:08.619
Everest. My mountain.

26:08.660 --> 26:10.696
I've paid two guides
over the past two years

26:10.730 --> 26:11.958
to get me to the top.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.059
And you observed
Mr. Cardiff on the South Col,

26:14.100 --> 26:15.192
is that correct?
Yes.

26:15.240 --> 26:18.038
Our Sherpa was injured in
an icefall the day before,

26:18.070 --> 26:20.630
and Mr. Cardiff was kind enough
to share one of his with us

26:20.680 --> 26:21.908
for the final assault.

26:21.940 --> 26:23.771
So you made the last
assault on Everest

26:23.810 --> 26:25.107
with Mr. Cardiff?

26:25.150 --> 26:27.243
My goodness,
that was not mentioned

26:27.280 --> 26:28.269
in Mr. Lambros's book.

26:28.320 --> 26:29.878
There were
a lot of things

26:29.920 --> 26:32.013
not in Danny's book.

26:32.050 --> 26:33.881
Many of us
in the climbing community

26:33.920 --> 26:36.059
were outraged at the
many distortions.

26:36.090 --> 26:38.149
Did you ever see Mr. Cardiff
step over a body,

26:38.190 --> 26:40.954
or take anyone's
oxygen tank?

26:41.000 --> 26:42.956
Of course not.
As far as I could tell,

26:43.000 --> 26:45.025
he was the perfect gentleman.
Thank you, Ms. Cox.

26:45.070 --> 26:48.790
Ms. Cox, were you sleeping
with Mr. Cardiff at base camp?

26:48.840 --> 26:51.206
IfI may interrupt. I might
suggest to my learned colleague

26:51.240 --> 26:53.003
that these News of
the World type smear tactics

26:53.040 --> 26:54.632
are beneath the dignity
of the court.

26:54.680 --> 26:56.875
I would tend to agree,
Mrs. Florrick.

26:56.910 --> 26:57.899
I'm sorry.

26:57.950 --> 26:59.303
Please move on.

26:59.350 --> 27:01.341
We need to find
another way to shake her.

27:01.380 --> 27:03.371
Yes, but unfortunately,
the judge agreed with her.

27:03.420 --> 27:04.887
I know.
Where's Kalinda?

27:04.920 --> 27:06.342
ELI:
This is my associate,
Kalinda Sharma.

27:06.390 --> 27:07.948
She's been helping me
prepare for this meeting.

27:07.990 --> 27:09.116
And these are my associates.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.958
I don't know their names,
but they're very expensive.

27:11.990 --> 27:13.252
So let's hear it, Eli.

27:13.290 --> 27:14.325
Three-day plan.

27:14.360 --> 27:17.193
Day one: I meet your candidate.

27:17.230 --> 27:20.688
I tell him that scandals
are owned by the first man in.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.958
Breitbart owned
the Weiner scandal.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.106
If Weiner had released
those tweets with his spin,

27:26.140 --> 27:28.301
he would still be
in office today.

27:28.340 --> 27:31.400
Day two: I don't ask your
candidate to tell me everything,

27:31.450 --> 27:33.077
because candidates lie.

27:33.110 --> 27:34.441
I'm falling asleep here, Eli.
But I do

27:34.480 --> 27:36.414
tell him we have to get
the nanny's story straight

27:36.450 --> 27:38.281
so that she doesn't hop off
to The National Enquirer.

27:38.320 --> 27:42.780
Day three: We acknowledge there
is some entertainment value

27:42.820 --> 27:45.380
in a father of three
sleeping with his nanny.

27:45.430 --> 27:48.354
And the goal is not to smother
that value, but to harness it.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.288
Hmm.

27:50.330 --> 27:51.297
That's very interesting.

27:51.330 --> 27:52.968
Thank you.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.434
Only problem is
it ain't Burke.

27:55.470 --> 27:58.303
_ Burke asked me to run
his campaign, but I said no.

27:58.340 --> 28:02.379
And that's what you saw when
you accidentally followed me.

28:02.410 --> 28:03.308
You're lying.

28:03.340 --> 28:04.500
No, I'm not.

28:04.550 --> 28:06.848
And here's the thing-- come on,
you follow any candidate,

28:06.880 --> 28:08.313
you're gonna find
a nanny, a hooker,

28:08.350 --> 28:10.113
a mistress or an intern.

28:10.150 --> 28:12.141
But thanks for the pitch, buddy.

28:12.190 --> 28:13.885
I'll see ya.

28:13.920 --> 28:16.013
Give me one more chance.

28:16.060 --> 28:17.823
Okay.

28:17.860 --> 28:20.181
I'm deciding Monday.

28:22.230 --> 28:24.164
There are
no other candidates.

28:24.200 --> 28:25.292
I checked.

28:25.330 --> 28:27.423
They all have
strategists already.

28:27.470 --> 28:28.869
Unless we go local.

28:28.900 --> 28:31.403
Nah, nah, he's a
national kind of guy.

28:31.440 --> 28:33.101
He may have gone
with someone new,

28:33.140 --> 28:35.108
but why pick a rotten
apple from the tree?

28:35.140 --> 28:36.368
Maybe it's a celebrity.

28:36.410 --> 28:38.844
No. I can't see him
tolerating that.

28:40.880 --> 28:42.108
What?

28:42.150 --> 28:43.276
I get it.

28:43.320 --> 28:44.912
He's flipping sides.

28:44.950 --> 28:45.917
It's a Republican.

28:48.160 --> 28:51.357
He wanted to play in the
presidential primaries.

28:51.390 --> 28:53.381
I'm on it.

28:53.430 --> 28:56.058
Mazel tov.

28:56.100 --> 28:57.522
ALICIA:
Thank you for returning,
Ms. Cox.

28:57.560 --> 28:59.266
No problem.
Before you went

28:59.300 --> 29:00.369
on your climb to Everest,

29:00.400 --> 29:01.469
did you have
any surgery performed?

29:01.500 --> 29:02.990
No.

29:03.040 --> 29:05.429
What do you mean?

29:05.470 --> 29:07.438
I mean, did you have
any surgery performed?

29:07.470 --> 29:09.472
COX:
No.

29:09.510 --> 29:11.808
What do you mean,
like an appendix out? No.

29:11.850 --> 29:13.147
Or LASIK surgery?

29:13.180 --> 29:13.771
Oh. Yeah.

29:13.820 --> 29:14.878
No, I-I thought
you meant,

29:14.920 --> 29:16.171
like, major surgery.

29:16.220 --> 29:17.209
Yeah, LASIK.

29:17.250 --> 29:18.911
That was a
while ago.

29:18.950 --> 29:20.315
I had contacts for
farsightedness,

29:20.350 --> 29:22.557
and I didn't want to deal
with them on the mountain.

29:22.590 --> 29:24.023
Good.

29:24.060 --> 29:26.051
And did you know that
LASIK reacts poorly

29:26.090 --> 29:28.126
to decreased
atmospheric pressure?

29:28.160 --> 29:29.422
I...

29:29.460 --> 29:31.189
I don't...

29:31.230 --> 29:32.299
What are you asking?

29:32.330 --> 29:34.093
I'm asking if
you knew that.

29:34.140 --> 29:35.437
No.

29:35.470 --> 29:36.698
The vision
of LASIK patients

29:36.740 --> 29:41.029
becomes blurry at high altitudes
in the weeks following surgery,

29:41.080 --> 29:43.071
due to decreased
atmospheric pressure.

29:43.110 --> 29:44.407
Was your vision blurry,
Ms. Cox?

29:44.450 --> 29:46.077
No.

29:46.110 --> 29:48.817
Isn't that why you had
Mr. Cardiff's Sherpa carry you

29:48.850 --> 29:50.147
the last thousand feet
up Everest?

29:50.180 --> 29:51.147
That's a lie.

29:51.190 --> 29:53.988
People keep saying that,
but I wasn't carried.

29:54.020 --> 29:57.820
Your Lordship,
this is a sworn affidavit from

29:57.860 --> 30:00.158
Tenji Gelu, the
Sherpa in question.

30:00.190 --> 30:02.294
Now, he swears that Ms. Cox
had blurry vision

30:02.330 --> 30:04.093
and could not
have seen

30:04.130 --> 30:05.062
any of the events in question.

30:05.100 --> 30:06.362
He's lying.

30:06.400 --> 30:08.061
He was always lying.

30:08.100 --> 30:09.499
He hated me because
I accused him

30:09.540 --> 30:11.132
of stealing my
satellite phone.

30:11.170 --> 30:13.104
Your Lordship,
given the circumstances,

30:13.140 --> 30:15.005
we ask that Ms. Cox be removed

30:15.040 --> 30:16.029
from the claimant's
Witness list.

30:16.080 --> 30:18.446
I would regretfully agree.

30:27.150 --> 30:28.287
I got it.

30:28.320 --> 30:30.151
Oh, no, that's okay.

30:30.190 --> 30:32.852
Mom, I got it.

30:32.890 --> 30:34.027
Are you okay?

30:34.060 --> 30:36.096
What, because I'm cleaning?

30:36.130 --> 30:37.427
Yes.

30:39.430 --> 30:40.863
You have work.

30:40.900 --> 30:42.993
I thought I'd
let you do it.

30:43.040 --> 30:45.600
Oh, you are so adorable.

30:45.640 --> 30:46.629
Oh, come on.

30:46.670 --> 30:49.104
You know it's gonna happen,
so just let it happen.

30:49.140 --> 30:51.005
Mm. Good.
Thank you.

30:54.020 --> 30:56.011
How's Dad?

30:56.050 --> 30:57.176
He's good.

30:57.220 --> 30:58.346
Are you good with him?

30:58.390 --> 31:00.142
Am I?

31:00.190 --> 31:01.919
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

31:01.960 --> 31:03.848
I mean, you know.

31:04.690 --> 31:06.351
What?

31:08.260 --> 31:09.955
Do you think I'm like him?

31:10.000 --> 31:12.264
Do I think you are?

31:13.270 --> 31:14.897
No.

31:14.940 --> 31:16.589
Really?

31:16.640 --> 31:18.505
You're different.

31:18.540 --> 31:20.269
Very different.

31:20.310 --> 31:21.629
Why?

31:21.680 --> 31:24.069
I just wanted to know.

31:24.110 --> 31:25.543
(doorbell rings)

31:25.580 --> 31:28.276
I'll get it.

31:33.120 --> 31:34.610
Diane.
Yes.

31:34.660 --> 31:36.150
I'm sorry, Alicia.

31:36.190 --> 31:37.282
I'm here, um...

31:37.320 --> 31:39.220
I'm trying to get
in touch with Peter,

31:39.260 --> 31:41.091
and the office said he was home.

31:42.130 --> 31:43.654
Oh.

31:43.700 --> 31:48.262
Uh, well, no,
he's-he's not here.

31:50.300 --> 31:51.403
I'm so sorry, Alicia.

31:51.440 --> 31:53.408
I would, I would never
do this to you,

31:53.440 --> 31:56.273
but do you have a minute?

32:04.550 --> 32:06.279
DIANE ; _
We're competing With

32:06.320 --> 32:09.209
two other law firms for_ the
state's attorney CIVII busmess.

32:09.260 --> 32:12.229
It would be very
lucrative, as you know.

32:12.260 --> 32:14.490
But Peter has asked
that we be audited

32:14.530 --> 32:17.055
by the Department
of Taxation.

32:17.100 --> 32:20.524
And that-- well, that
would be quite invasive.

32:20.570 --> 32:23.164
Grace, I'll be there
in a minute.

32:25.070 --> 32:26.469
How old?

32:26.510 --> 32:28.205
Fourteen.

32:28.240 --> 32:29.229
That's a sweet age.

32:29.280 --> 32:33.478
Aanay, I-I suggested
to the state's attorney

32:33.510 --> 32:36.240
_ that we use an
independent auditor,

32:36.280 --> 32:39.647
but he insisted on a
departmental audit.

32:39.690 --> 32:42.488
And that would
open up our books

32:42.520 --> 32:45.182
in an alarming way.

32:45.230 --> 32:47.721
Um, I'm not sure I...

32:47.760 --> 32:49.728
I checked with the
two other law firms

32:49.760 --> 32:51.489
under consideration,
and they have not been

32:51.530 --> 32:53.168
asked to do the same.

32:53.200 --> 32:57.239
So I was wondering, is there
something I should know

32:57.270 --> 33:01.673
about why Peter's
only asking us?

33:05.310 --> 33:08.177
Diane, I've worked hard

33:08.220 --> 33:11.041
to keep my home life
separate from my work life.

33:11.090 --> 33:14.389
I know, and I
respect that.

33:14.420 --> 33:18.481
But I need to know if
Peter is doing the same.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.324
I don't know
how to answer that.

33:24.370 --> 33:25.769
Well, let me
ask you this.

33:25.800 --> 33:28.166
If you were assisting
me in this decision,

33:28.200 --> 33:30.737
how would you advise?

33:30.770 --> 33:34.331
Agree to the audit or not?

33:40.610 --> 33:43.317
I would advise you not to.

33:51.260 --> 33:54.457
Uh, you really have a very
lovely apartment, Alicia.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.491
Thank you.

33:59.830 --> 34:02.264
Take two.

34:03.300 --> 34:04.801
Morning.

34:04.840 --> 34:07.468
So, let's hear
what you got.

34:07.510 --> 34:09.375
Actually, Ms. Sharma and I
discussed it,

34:09.410 --> 34:10.729
and we've decided to pass

34:10.780 --> 34:12.270
on your polite
offer to pitch.

34:12.310 --> 34:13.277
But thank you.

34:13.310 --> 34:15.278
(laughs)

34:15.320 --> 34:17.140
You're kidding me, right?

34:17.180 --> 34:18.249
Nope.

34:18.290 --> 34:19.211
But thanks.

34:19.250 --> 34:22.356
(chuckling):
I mean, what the hell is that?

34:22.390 --> 34:24.779
Don't you think you could've
told me that over the phone?

34:24.830 --> 34:27.151
I could've, but that would've
taken up less of your time.

34:28.200 --> 34:29.326
Go to hell.

34:38.210 --> 34:39.302
What's going on?

34:39.340 --> 34:40.659
I don't like being used.

34:40.710 --> 34:42.132
What are you talking about?

34:42.180 --> 34:43.499
How did I use you?
You're considering

34:43.540 --> 34:45.508
joining a Republican
presidential campaign.

34:47.410 --> 34:49.378
No comment.
But the guy's too clean.

34:49.420 --> 34:50.739
You can't find a single thing
wrong with him.

34:50.780 --> 34:52.281
He's too good to be true.

34:52.320 --> 34:54.356
I don't know
who you're talking about.

34:58.860 --> 35:00.782
Okay.

35:03.530 --> 35:05.395
And?

35:05.430 --> 35:07.318
And you didn't have
the money to vet him,

35:07.370 --> 35:08.860
so you hinted that
you wanted to hire me

35:08.900 --> 35:10.436
so_I would vet
him for you.

35:11.540 --> 35:13.132
(chuckling)

35:13.170 --> 35:14.706
Poor man's crawfishing.

35:14.740 --> 35:16.332
You let the tourist
set the bacon trap,

35:16.380 --> 35:18.177
and then you go in
and raid them.

35:18.210 --> 35:20.599
Yeah, Mickey, uh, tell me the
last time you were in the bayou.

35:20.650 --> 35:23.414
So cut the Trapper
John crap, okay?

35:23.450 --> 35:24.212
Oh, you going
to offend me now?

35:24.250 --> 35:25.740
Oh, yeah. I'm just
getting started.

35:26.790 --> 35:28.382
Okay.

35:28.420 --> 35:30.217
What did you find out?

35:30.260 --> 35:31.284
No.
Come on.

35:31.330 --> 35:32.319
I'll hire you.

35:32.360 --> 35:34.351
No, here's how it works.

35:34.400 --> 35:37.426
You first offer your
services to your Republican,

35:37.460 --> 35:38.768
then you hire me.

35:38.800 --> 35:40.791
I already did.
He hired me.

35:40.830 --> 35:42.491
KALINDA:
Nope. He's had two meetings,

35:42.540 --> 35:44.428
but he hasn't jumped yet.

35:45.640 --> 35:46.732
Go get hired.

35:46.770 --> 35:48.374
And you'll work
for a Republican?

35:48.410 --> 35:49.934
I don't mind this guy.
He's not bad.

35:49.980 --> 35:51.948
Okay.

35:51.980 --> 35:53.948
I'll call you tomorrow.

35:53.980 --> 35:55.516
No hard feelings, right?

35:55.550 --> 35:57.415
Go.
Hey. It's business.

35:57.450 --> 35:59.179
Go!
All right. I'll see you.

36:02.490 --> 36:04.253
I'll be calling on you again.

36:05.560 --> 36:07.551
It's your dime.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.365
BRANNON:
Mr. Cardiff, good evening.

36:16.400 --> 36:18.265
Actually, good morning.

36:18.310 --> 36:19.663
BRANNON:
Yes.

36:19.710 --> 36:21.473
Of course. Good morning.

36:21.510 --> 36:25.378
A year before you climbed
Everest, Mr. Cardiff,

36:25.410 --> 36:28.516
you successfully summited
the Trango Towers in Pakistan.

36:29.680 --> 36:31.341
Trango II, to be exact.

36:31.390 --> 36:32.482
Trango II.

36:32.520 --> 36:34.750
You came
upon a team

36:34.790 --> 36:36.985
of Japanese mountaineers
during that climb, did you not?

36:37.020 --> 36:39.921
Let's see.
It's, uh... it's been so long.

36:39.960 --> 36:41.996
In fact, you not only
came upon them,

36:42.030 --> 36:43.827
you took the ropes and pitons

36:43.860 --> 36:45.293
from a dying
Japanese climber.

36:45.330 --> 36:46.763
THRUSH:
If I may quickly
ask my learned colleague

36:46.800 --> 36:49.268
to _which materials he
is referring here.

36:49.300 --> 36:51.530
The book, Only in May,
the account

36:51.570 --> 36:53.561
of a French climbing expedition
to the Trango Towers.

36:53.610 --> 36:54.702
Yes, that was
my worry.

36:54.740 --> 36:56.469
Your Lordship, Mr. Cardiff
previously brought suit--

36:56.510 --> 36:57.329
brought successful suit--

36:57.380 --> 37:00.406
against the publisher
of that very book.

37:00.450 --> 37:02.543
It has been deemed
libelous and therefore

37:02.580 --> 37:05.310
_cannot be mentioned
in these proceedings.

37:08.890 --> 37:10.858
Well, then, let me ask you this.

37:10.890 --> 37:12.721
In that expedition--

37:12.760 --> 37:14.625
the one that I was just
talking about...
Apologies for interrupting

37:14.660 --> 37:16.491
again, Your Lordship,
but as part

37:16.530 --> 37:19.363
of the successful suit against
the aforementioned book,

37:19.400 --> 37:21.868
Mr. Cardiff instigated
a superinjunction,

37:21.900 --> 37:24.698
which, of course, means
not only are we prevented

37:24.740 --> 37:25.900
from discussing
the book here,

37:25.940 --> 37:27.362
we are prevented
from even discussing

37:27.410 --> 37:31.540
the supposed events
alluded to in that book.

37:31.580 --> 37:33.878
Oh, come on.
Even the request by my
learned colleague here

37:33.910 --> 37:35.411
must be stricken
from the record.

37:35.450 --> 37:37.748
It is as if the book
and its events,

37:37.780 --> 37:40.817
and even events questioning
the events, never happened.

37:40.850 --> 37:41.885
BRANNON:
Unless, of course,

37:41.920 --> 37:44.718
it's discussed in the
English press, Your Lordship.

37:44.760 --> 37:46.625
Yes, and we would ask
for a superinjunction

37:46.660 --> 37:48.491
to prevent the mention
of the superinjunction.

37:48.530 --> 37:50.794
Only in England.

37:50.830 --> 37:52.468
Look, I'm sorry, but
that is not necessary.

37:52.500 --> 37:53.967
We need to get that book in.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.592
The climb to Trango Towers.

37:55.640 --> 37:57.494
It shows a pattern of abuse.

37:58.670 --> 37:59.807
Where are you going?

37:59.840 --> 38:01.637
I have an idea.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.739
No, there's nothing there.
I... what am I looking for?

38:03.780 --> 38:06.340
I don't understand what the
purpose of this whole page is.

38:06.380 --> 38:08.678
Eli, you still have your
geek squad together, right?

38:08.720 --> 38:10.472
Well, hello, Alicia.
How are you?

38:10.520 --> 38:12.681
You still have your Internet
trolls who tweet anonymously?

38:12.720 --> 38:14.483
Yeah. Why?
What do you need?

38:14.520 --> 38:16.317
I need some tweeting.

38:26.530 --> 38:29.693
The tweeting fairies did
their work during the night.

38:29.740 --> 38:31.935
I don't know what
you're talking about.

38:31.970 --> 38:35.770
BRANNON:
100,000 tweet followers,
Your Lordship.

38:35.810 --> 38:38.506
The superinjunction
and Mr. Cardiff's actions

38:38.550 --> 38:41.371
are now a matter of discussion
in the English press.

38:41.420 --> 38:42.819
This is an obscenity,
Your Lordship.

38:42.850 --> 38:44.010
In this morning's Chronicle:

38:44.050 --> 38:46.814
"What did Oliver Cardiff do
on the slopes of Trango II?"

38:46.850 --> 38:48.818
Your Lordship, where
is the respect for our laws

38:48.860 --> 38:50.509
when any young thug
with a computer

38:50.560 --> 38:51.652
and a Twitter account

38:51.690 --> 38:53.555
can circumvent
a lawful injunction...

38:53.590 --> 38:55.820
BRANNON:
I'm sorry, Mr. Thrush,

38:55.860 --> 38:57.555
but I haven't finished.

38:57.600 --> 38:59.420
Yes.

38:59.470 --> 39:01.688
Please continue, Mr. Brannon.

39:01.740 --> 39:04.459
BRANNON:
The subject of
Mr. Cardiff's actions

39:04.510 --> 39:06.068
during his Pakistani
climbing expedition

39:06.110 --> 39:07.566
are now a subject
of concern

39:07.610 --> 39:09.669
in the English press,
Your Lordship.

39:09.710 --> 39:10.802
Therefore,
I do not need

39:10.840 --> 39:13.149
the manuscript of Only in May

39:13.180 --> 39:15.068
in order to _ask
these questions.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.075
We still believe the stricture

39:16.120 --> 39:17.815
of the superinjunction applies,
Your Lordship.

39:21.990 --> 39:23.617
I did nothing wrong.

39:23.660 --> 39:25.389
You didn't take the rope
and climbing gear

39:25.430 --> 39:28.627
from the Japanese team
on Trango Tower-- Trango II?

39:28.660 --> 39:29.922
I did nothing wrong.

39:29.960 --> 39:31.996
Then why did the French team
say they found you

39:32.030 --> 39:33.099
with the Japanese pitons?

39:33.130 --> 39:34.529
We do not use pitons.

39:34.570 --> 39:35.696
We're clean climbers.

39:35.740 --> 39:37.628
We use chockstones
and quickdraws.

39:37.670 --> 39:39.501
Yes, which you took
from a Japanese climber.

39:39.540 --> 39:41.132
He was dying.

39:44.680 --> 39:48.172
(scoffs)
The hypocrisy here is amazing.

39:48.210 --> 39:49.677
You, Danny,

39:49.720 --> 39:52.484
you were on K2 when a
Korean climber died.

39:52.520 --> 39:53.714
I know for a personal fact

39:53.750 --> 39:55.809
you passed him on the
way to the summit.

39:55.860 --> 39:57.088
That was different.

39:57.120 --> 39:58.678
How was that
different?

39:58.730 --> 39:59.981
Because he wasn't
your brother?

40:01.900 --> 40:03.697
He froze to death,
and you left him.

40:03.730 --> 40:05.027
I left him.
Every climber left him.

40:05.070 --> 40:05.991
And why?

40:06.030 --> 40:09.761
Because we would have died
carrying him down.

40:09.800 --> 40:11.665
It is the law of
the death zone.

40:11.710 --> 40:13.507
We all know we can't
be carried out.

40:13.540 --> 40:15.701
And so you did
it on Everest.

40:16.980 --> 40:19.801
The events as described in
Danny's book are a lie.

40:19.850 --> 40:22.739
Even though you passed a dying
Robert Lambros on Everest?

40:22.780 --> 40:25.647
The book, as told, is a lie.

40:25.690 --> 40:27.715
BRANNON:
Mr. Cardiff,
are you planning

40:27.750 --> 40:28.717
another climbing expedition?

40:28.760 --> 40:29.954
Yes.

40:29.990 --> 40:31.480
VVhen?
Don't answer that.

40:31.530 --> 40:32.827
Patagonia, in one month.

40:32.860 --> 40:34.054
Your Lordship, there
is qualified privilege

40:34.090 --> 40:36.627
as an exception
to our libel laws.

40:36.660 --> 40:38.491
And what is that,
Mr. Brannon?

40:38.530 --> 40:39.428
When they are a warning.

40:39.470 --> 40:42.689
Mr. Cardiff has demonstrated
a predisposition

40:42.740 --> 40:46.562
for bypassing stranded
climbers at altitude.

40:46.610 --> 40:49.773
Now, if this book is a warning
to climbers in the future,

40:49.810 --> 40:52.199
then it is no longer held
to the same burden of proof

40:52.250 --> 40:54.741
maintained by our libel laws.

40:54.780 --> 40:58.079
I, therefore, ask
that this suit be dismissed

40:58.120 --> 41:01.556
because this book,
Your Lordship, is a warning.

41:01.590 --> 41:03.057
THRUSH:
Your Lordship,
that is a strange

41:03.090 --> 41:05.650
interpretation
of the law.

41:05.690 --> 41:08.488
No, Mr. Thrush. I'm sorry.

41:08.530 --> 41:11.522
I don't_ think it's _
a strange interpretation

41:11.570 --> 41:12.764
of the law at all.

41:12.800 --> 41:14.859
In fact, it seems right.

41:14.900 --> 41:16.834
We would agree

41:16.870 --> 41:18.758
with Mr. Brannon

41:18.810 --> 41:22.268
and therefore dismiss the suit
in letter rogatory.

41:22.310 --> 41:23.777
(claps)

41:23.810 --> 41:26.677
Oh. (clears throat)
Uh, apologies, Your Lordship.

41:26.710 --> 41:27.972
(clears throat)

41:31.790 --> 41:33.746
Thank you.
Seriously.

41:33.790 --> 41:35.587
BRANNON:
It's been a pleasure.

41:47.170 --> 41:48.990
So you decided
against an audit.

41:50.870 --> 41:53.202
Smart.

41:53.240 --> 41:55.936
Have Alicia and her husband
separated?

41:58.210 --> 41:59.973
Is it any of our business?

42:00.010 --> 42:02.843
If there is bl_owback
on our firm,

42:02.880 --> 42:05.815
then yes, it is our business.

42:05.850 --> 42:08.887
Is there blowback on our ﬁrm?

42:09.920 --> 42:12.150
Will.

42:12.190 --> 42:14.750
This is my life.

42:14.800 --> 42:16.153
It's yours, too.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.964
Have Alicia and her husband
separated?

42:20.000 --> 42:21.194
Ask her.

42:25.210 --> 42:27.064
(sighs)

42:27.110 --> 42:29.931
We can't be the enemy
of the state's attorney.

42:29.980 --> 42:31.709
We're not.
He wanted
to audit us.

42:31.750 --> 42:34.139
Because he wants to
run a clean office.

42:35.180 --> 42:36.909
This is crazy.

42:36.950 --> 42:37.917
She's supposed to work for us.

42:37.950 --> 42:39.815
If she's working against,
we should let her go.

42:39.850 --> 42:40.987
She's not.

42:42.020 --> 42:43.783
But if she is?

42:43.820 --> 42:46.653
Then...

42:46.690 --> 42:48.692
we'll let her go.

42:51.830 --> 42:55.937
If she works against us,
we are letting her go.

42:57.740 --> 42:59.833
I can hold you to that?

43:03.940 --> 43:05.942
Yes.
