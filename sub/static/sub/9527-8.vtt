00:02.211 --> 00:03.753
In today's society

00:03.837 --> 00:07.006
of socioeconomic disparity
and global terrorism,

00:07.091 --> 00:10.343
being a ripped dude
has never been more important.

00:10.427 --> 00:15.014
That's why, with DeMamp Camps'
muscle perplexation technique,

00:15.099 --> 00:18.643
I guarantee I'll get you ripped.

00:18.727 --> 00:20.603
DeMamp Camp! Go!

00:20.688 --> 00:22.021
Go!

00:22.106 --> 00:24.273
Go. Sorry.

00:26.235 --> 00:27.860
If you need a modifier

00:27.945 --> 00:29.862
'cause your body's shaped
like a bowl of porridge,

00:29.947 --> 00:31.364
check out Ders,

00:31.448 --> 00:33.199
and if you're weak like your great-grandma,

00:33.283 --> 00:34.367
peep Blake.

00:34.451 --> 00:36.703
DeMamp Camp! Come on.

00:36.787 --> 00:38.830
-Dig in...
-Whoa.

00:38.914 --> 00:40.832
What are you talking about?
I have an awesome body.

00:40.916 --> 00:42.041
In the right light,

00:42.126 --> 00:43.668
I have the little things that Usher has.

00:43.752 --> 00:45.002
No, your body is awesome, Blake,

00:45.087 --> 00:46.295
but you don't work for it, okay?

00:46.380 --> 00:48.047
So, your muscles look good,

00:48.132 --> 00:49.882
but you actually can't use them

00:49.967 --> 00:51.676
to tow a car with your teeth.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.137
Well, my body is the normal
shape of an aging mesomorph,

00:54.221 --> 00:55.388
so, you got to change these lines.

00:55.472 --> 00:56.723
You have tits,

00:56.807 --> 00:58.141
and I can't change these lines,

00:58.225 --> 00:59.892
and I'm not gonna cut anything out,

00:59.977 --> 01:03.938
because DeMamp Camp Fitness:
Volume Two has no cuts.

01:04.022 --> 01:05.565
If you don't change the hurtful things

01:05.649 --> 01:06.774
that you just said about us,

01:06.859 --> 01:09.152
I'm off the project.

01:09.236 --> 01:11.571
No one's gonna buy DVDs from a nobody

01:11.655 --> 01:13.573
that's out of shape and has a face

01:13.657 --> 01:14.991
that looks like someone took a bunch

01:15.075 --> 01:16.909
of skin-colored Play-Doh and just went...

01:19.204 --> 01:20.997
-We're off the project.
-We're off the project.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.498
You said that. Yeah, you already said that.

01:22.583 --> 01:23.916
It doesn't matter.

01:24.001 --> 01:25.293
I actually have an awesome face, so, that...

01:25.377 --> 01:28.254
It doesn't even hurt my feelings.

01:28.338 --> 01:30.339
...deep and find yourself.

01:30.424 --> 01:31.841
Don't worry.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.843
We'll make this work, you sweet prince.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.304
Bitch, are you talking to yourself?

01:36.388 --> 01:39.182
Yeah, I am, okay?

01:39.266 --> 01:41.058
Could you give us the room?

01:47.232 --> 01:49.650
I'm fresh

01:49.735 --> 01:51.611
You gotta, you gotta
you gotta, gotta

01:51.695 --> 01:53.488
Gotta be fresh

01:58.911 --> 02:00.077
I don't care.

02:01.538 --> 02:03.790
-Time to give Blake a donut.
-Nah. No, thank you.

02:03.874 --> 02:05.792
I do not eat that junk anymore.

02:05.876 --> 02:07.293
-What do you mean?
-Check it out.

02:07.377 --> 02:11.756
Look what I made. It's a weed protein bar.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.926
-I call it a dro-tein bar.
-Dude, looks pretty gross.

02:15.010 --> 02:16.260
Yeah, it looks really gross.

02:16.345 --> 02:18.429
Is it because you're embarrassed

02:18.514 --> 02:20.389
about how weak you were
when you saw yourself

02:20.474 --> 02:21.474
in the video?

02:21.558 --> 02:23.726
-Hmm?
-Yeah.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.269
What you said really hurt my feelings,

02:25.354 --> 02:26.854
but I don't like to exercise,

02:26.939 --> 02:28.731
so I'm gonna just eat until I'm strong.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.149
-Good for you.
-Yeah.

02:30.234 --> 02:31.692
That's actually not a bad...

02:33.320 --> 02:35.029
Jillian, get this the F out of the way, please.

02:35.113 --> 02:37.156
-Yup.
-When have I ever talked behind...

02:37.241 --> 02:39.075
-Just thought it'd be cool.
-A pedestal.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.160
-I got it.
-Yeah.

02:41.245 --> 02:43.830
-I don't want...
-No, I got it.

02:43.914 --> 02:47.250
Okay, the TelAmeriCorp blood drive.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.544
Why should you donate?
Corporate set up a competition.

02:49.628 --> 02:52.046
The branch that donates
the most pints of blood

02:52.130 --> 02:53.256
wins a visit from...

02:53.340 --> 02:54.632
Jillian, get the cutout.

02:54.716 --> 02:55.842
-Oh, now?
-Now.

02:58.095 --> 03:02.557
Wins a visit from action hero
Dolph Lundgren.

03:04.226 --> 03:06.853
Ivan Drago. Oh, my God.

03:06.937 --> 03:09.188
Question. Dude, stop it.

03:09.273 --> 03:12.191
Why does Dolph Lundgren
want to do some dumb health

03:12.276 --> 03:13.526
blood thing with us?

03:13.610 --> 03:14.610
Oh, I don't know.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.238
Maybe 'cause he's a decent person
who wants to contribute to society.

03:17.447 --> 03:18.865
That's so Dolph of him.

03:19.074 --> 03:20.867
Anyway, we're the last branch to donate.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.368
That pig Steve in Tarzana

03:22.452 --> 03:24.579
thinks his 29-pint lead will hold,

03:24.663 --> 03:27.039
but I'd love to man-splain to him that he lost.

03:27.124 --> 03:29.333
You guys, I've got a question
that I've wanted to ask Dolph

03:29.418 --> 03:31.210
since I was, like, a child,

03:31.295 --> 03:32.879
and the answer could change everything.

03:32.963 --> 03:34.881
Shut up, 'cause I'm freaking realizing

03:34.965 --> 03:36.215
a great idea.

03:36.300 --> 03:38.217
He could be the costar to my main star

03:38.302 --> 03:40.261
for DeMamp Camp: Volume Two, right?

03:40.345 --> 03:42.096
You're making another DeMamp Camp?

03:42.180 --> 03:44.015
That copy of Volume One you gave me

03:44.099 --> 03:46.225
changed my life.

03:46.310 --> 03:49.061
Bikini season can't come soon enough.

03:49.146 --> 03:51.272
Okay, first off, ew, and second of all,

03:51.356 --> 03:53.524
we can hear you, so shut up.

03:53.609 --> 03:56.193
All right, now, there are
32 employees in this office

03:56.278 --> 03:57.862
and we need 30 pints to win,

03:57.946 --> 03:59.864
so we got this thing in the bag.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.407
-Yeah, whoo!
-Yeah.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.659
Unless some of you are scared of needles.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.121
- What? Is that real?
- I mean...

04:09.625 --> 04:11.375
Excuse me,

04:11.460 --> 04:14.754
but scared-ness of needles
is no laughing matter.

04:14.838 --> 04:16.464
I personally am not afraid of needles,

04:16.548 --> 04:20.551
but I did see someone
murdered with a needle

04:20.636 --> 04:22.136
in the movie Gremlins.

04:22.220 --> 04:25.014
Needle-phobes have rights too, so...

04:25.098 --> 04:27.016
Thank you. That's my time.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.226
Great, and nobody cares, all right?

04:29.311 --> 04:30.478
All right, so let's break.

04:30.562 --> 04:32.730
-Let's give that blood.
-Whoo!

04:32.814 --> 04:33.981
-Let's tear it up.
-Take it all.

04:34.066 --> 04:36.567
-Whoo!
-Whoo!

04:36.652 --> 04:38.069
-What's up?
-Hey.

04:38.153 --> 04:39.570
I just want to say thank you.

04:39.655 --> 04:41.447
It's good to have one of us speaking up.

04:41.531 --> 04:42.740
Not afraid of needles.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.033
Not one of whatever you guys are.

04:44.117 --> 04:47.912
It is okay to fear the needle,

04:47.996 --> 04:50.790
but please do not fear your...

04:50.874 --> 04:52.375
I'm not one of you.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.085
I support you and what you're doing, but...

04:54.169 --> 04:56.170
Stop touching me. Don't ever do that.

04:56.254 --> 04:58.589
-And just listen.
-Hey.

04:58.674 --> 05:01.092
You guys aren't gonna puss out
on me, are you?

05:01.176 --> 05:02.635
Okay, I'm only saying that

05:02.719 --> 05:04.053
'cause you're hiding in this room,

05:04.137 --> 05:05.930
and I am very intuitive, like a mother.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.306
I'm gonna go give blood right now.

05:07.391 --> 05:09.308
Alice Murphy...

05:10.560 --> 05:11.936
I'm gonna go give blood. Okay.

05:13.605 --> 05:15.731
Hey, Karl, I need your help.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.192
Dolph Lundgren, man,
I've seen all of his movies.

05:18.276 --> 05:20.945
He's, like, so cool.

05:21.029 --> 05:23.739
Do you know if, like, Dolph is gonna...

05:26.076 --> 05:28.619
Carmen. It's me, Mr. Henderson.

05:28.704 --> 05:31.163
I used to bring you empty cans
outside the liquor store.

05:31.248 --> 05:33.958
Hey, how long
have you been un-homeless for?

05:34.042 --> 05:36.252
Oh, my God, you must be really light-headed.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.837
You used to have the best singing voice.

05:37.921 --> 05:41.507
-So beautiful.
-That's not me.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.801
Eat your cookies, okay?

05:43.885 --> 05:45.011
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:45.095 --> 05:46.595
Hold your horsies.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.514
How many people we got signed up so far?

05:48.598 --> 05:52.518
Uh, 25, so you'll win second place.

05:52.602 --> 05:55.855
Okay, well, we don't get
second place around here.

05:55.939 --> 05:58.274
So how about we go ahead

05:58.358 --> 06:01.986
and strap on a few more
baggy sacks for daddy?

06:02.070 --> 06:03.946
I can handle, like, five more probably.

06:04.031 --> 06:07.908
Mmm-hmm. One pint per each.

06:09.453 --> 06:10.995
Okay, guess what?

06:11.079 --> 06:13.706
Your pass to DeMamp Camp...

06:14.374 --> 06:16.792
And that's me ripping it up.

06:17.753 --> 06:20.629
I'm taking cookies. I'm taking three.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.215
-I'm taking three.
-Jazzy.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.384
I'm gonna take this batch
out to the blood bank.

06:25.469 --> 06:27.553
-Can you handle this in here?
-Mmm-hmm, yeah.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.930
Is this his blood, right there?

06:30.015 --> 06:32.767
Okay, you want anything
from the Pizza Hut in Target?

06:32.851 --> 06:36.228
You know me, girl. You always know me.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.898
-Blue ICEE.
-Oh.

06:38.982 --> 06:41.525
-Yeah, I didn't...
-All right, all right.

06:44.029 --> 06:45.446
-Excuse me.
-Yeah?

06:45.530 --> 06:47.990
What are you doing with my blood?
Why isn't it with all the rest?

06:49.159 --> 06:51.285
-Where's this blood going?
-Just eat your cookies, and move along.

06:55.248 --> 06:58.918
Got a bad feeling about this
gosh-forsaken blood drive.

06:59.002 --> 07:00.753
For instance, why won't they even tell us

07:00.837 --> 07:02.296
where the blood is going?

07:02.380 --> 07:05.007
Oh, it's for patients at hospitals.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.468
-Yes, yeah.
-Right?

07:07.552 --> 07:10.471
Yes, but why is Dolph involved, hmm?

07:10.555 --> 07:12.306
Does this internet
have computer capabilities?

07:12.390 --> 07:15.976
Okay. I need you to pull up his IMDb page,
and I need that yesterday.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.564
Well, it says here he's MIT smart,

07:20.649 --> 07:23.067
chemical engineer, a karate master.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.361
Why is he making action movies
with these idiots?

07:25.487 --> 07:28.364
-He's perfect.
-Yeah, it doesn't make sense.

07:29.199 --> 07:32.993
He's got the brains to be, like,
a chemical-genetic engineering dude,

07:33.078 --> 07:34.870
but he didn't have the resources.

07:36.623 --> 07:42.211
So he went and became famous,
and now he has access to the blood.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.797
The blood.

07:45.715 --> 07:49.301
He's got access to any of my... Holy cow!

07:49.386 --> 07:50.970
Look at his balls in those Dockers.

07:51.847 --> 07:54.306
Oh, my gosh.

07:54.391 --> 07:56.642
I could click and zoom all day.

07:56.726 --> 07:59.770
--Damn it. TelAmeriCorp.

08:08.738 --> 08:11.615
Hey, Sir Edna, I got your blood.

08:11.700 --> 08:14.118
Okay. Whose blood is it?

08:14.202 --> 08:15.578
No, don't tell me.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.329
I understand sometimes people just need

08:17.414 --> 08:20.082
to slip through the cracks, just disappear.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.209
What? No, it's gonna be my blood.

08:22.294 --> 08:23.460
-Come on.
-What?

08:23.545 --> 08:25.296
Take this blade.

08:25.380 --> 08:26.672
No. No, no, no, wait.

08:26.756 --> 08:28.007
I'm gonna take the tube,

08:28.091 --> 08:30.009
I'm gonna put it right next to my wrist
and you're gonna cut me.

08:30.093 --> 08:32.386
No, Karl, I... I'm hemophobic.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.680
Oh, my God, Ders. It's 2015.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.891
Gay dudes exist. Get over it.

08:36.975 --> 08:38.767
-Cut me!
-Okay, all right.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.102
Dolph Lundgren. Dolph Lundgren.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.353
-Dolph Lundgren.
-Hit me, baby.

08:41.438 --> 08:42.855
Dolph Lundgren!

08:42.939 --> 08:44.356
-Uh, try it again.
-Dolph Lundgren.

08:44.441 --> 08:45.691
Okay, just... You know what?

08:45.775 --> 08:47.193
-Okay, go down the river.
-Dolph Lundgren.

08:47.277 --> 08:48.527
-Dolph Lundgren.
-Go down one more time.

08:48.612 --> 08:49.695
-I don't know.
-Let me see the blade.

08:49.779 --> 08:50.863
Yeah.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.534
-Shit!
-Dolph Lundgren!

08:55.619 --> 08:56.952
-Dolph Lundgren!
-Okay.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.371
-Dolph Lundgren!
-Oh, oh!

08:59.456 --> 09:00.581
-What are you...
-We got it.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.041
Why'd you lick it, man?

09:02.125 --> 09:04.793
I thought it was like a ballpoint pen, man,
but it's working.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.212
-It's working.
-Okay.

09:10.508 --> 09:12.259
Stop.

09:12.344 --> 09:14.929
Waymond, give me your glasses.

09:15.013 --> 09:16.764
I just came up with a great idea.

09:16.848 --> 09:17.973
Hands up.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.433
Give me your shirt

09:19.517 --> 09:20.893
and a smear of your wildly potent cologne.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.228
You stink. What is that?

09:22.312 --> 09:23.979
Cool Water? It's an aphrodisiac.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.397
I like that. That's nice.

09:25.482 --> 09:27.566
They tell me that I can't give blood.

09:27.651 --> 09:30.903
Well, guess what, "nurses."

09:30.987 --> 09:32.238
I'll trick the system.

09:32.322 --> 09:34.406
I'll give blood using the identities

09:34.491 --> 09:36.575
of my bitch-ass coworkers.

09:36.660 --> 09:38.077
This is perfect.

09:38.161 --> 09:39.995
Thank God I have all these muscles.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.997
It's DeMamp Camp.
It's part... It doesn't matter.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.666
Give me a little more of that.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.584
Give me a little more of that.
I want to reek like you.

09:45.669 --> 09:48.671
I cannot wait to tell Dolph I did this.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.759
Hi, I've got to get back to work,

09:53.843 --> 09:55.970
and I gave blood with the other nurse.

09:56.054 --> 09:57.513
That's why you didn't see me do it.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.181
And she said I could just
drop this off with you.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.432
Okay, sure. Do you want a sticker?

10:00.517 --> 10:02.601
I, uh... Yeah. Yes.

10:02.686 --> 10:04.812
-Yeah, you do.
-Great.

10:04.896 --> 10:06.272
Very cool. Oh, hi.

10:06.356 --> 10:07.481
-Hey.
-All right.

10:07.565 --> 10:08.691
Good-bye.

10:10.860 --> 10:14.196
Hi, are you ready to give some blood?

10:17.200 --> 10:18.617
Yes?

10:18.702 --> 10:20.327
Oh, hello, nurses.

10:20.412 --> 10:24.707
I am Waymond Womano,
a short Asian-type man.

10:24.791 --> 10:28.627
Ready to give blood for the first time today.

10:28.712 --> 10:31.130
Two Waymonds.

10:32.924 --> 10:36.093
-Hello?
-Blake, I hit the mother lode.

10:36.177 --> 10:37.428
My desk, now.

10:38.847 --> 10:41.432
Hey, Alice. There any purple stuff in there?

10:41.516 --> 10:45.686
'Cause I'm just trying to get
my blood sugar back in sync.

10:45.770 --> 10:48.939
Oh, wow. Congrats, Anders.

10:49.024 --> 10:50.649
-That's how we do.
-You know what?

10:50.734 --> 10:54.486
Everybody, let's give Anders
a standing ovation, huh?

10:56.072 --> 10:57.406
You know what?

10:57.490 --> 10:58.782
I'm gonna have this fiber yogurt.

10:58.867 --> 11:01.285
Why don't we all clap for me too, huh?

11:01.369 --> 11:02.453
Come on.

11:04.289 --> 11:05.372
Moron.

11:06.374 --> 11:08.375
Hey, man, you gave blood?

11:08.752 --> 11:11.253
How big was them needles?
One of them long suckers?

11:11.338 --> 11:13.589
You know, normal, the normal size they are.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.382
You know what? Maybe we should do this.

11:15.467 --> 11:16.967
I don't know. What do y'all think?

11:17.052 --> 11:19.636
I shouldn't medically, but I'm willing to try.

11:19.721 --> 11:21.430
Maybe don't. I don't know.

11:21.514 --> 11:25.392
Two Waymond Womanos.

11:25.477 --> 11:27.478
So, I guess the fake one is the one

11:27.562 --> 11:30.105
that looks the guy named Adam
who came in earlier.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.482
I know.

11:31.566 --> 11:33.400
-He looks exactly like that guy.
-No, you.

11:33.485 --> 11:35.277
You could tell. Dang it.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.987
Since I know you're cheating,

11:37.072 --> 11:38.655
I'm gonna have to remove two from the board.

11:38.740 --> 11:42.451
What? I need Dolph for my video, okay?

11:44.996 --> 11:47.706
I'm so freaking mad at you.

11:47.791 --> 11:51.043
-What's the mother lode?
-You're not gonna believe this.

11:52.629 --> 11:53.921
Check this out.

11:54.339 --> 11:55.881
When I'm with you

11:55.965 --> 11:57.091
Baby, baby

11:57.175 --> 11:58.759
I'm so into you

11:58.843 --> 12:01.637
This is your big find?

12:01.721 --> 12:04.640
No, I made it.

12:08.269 --> 12:09.853
Jillian, I can't have you back here

12:09.938 --> 12:12.189
baking your own muffin
to Dolph collages, all right?

12:12.273 --> 12:14.900
I need you to focus on finding the source.

12:16.820 --> 12:18.946
I got to follow that blood.

12:20.490 --> 12:22.783
-It's been a long day.
-It has.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.868
I mean, Raymond with a "W."

12:24.953 --> 12:27.413
I can't believe that white boy
thought we weren't gonna realize

12:27.497 --> 12:29.540
that he had already been up in there before.

12:29.624 --> 12:32.543
Oh, wait, which Waymond
did this come from?

12:32.627 --> 12:33.836
Girl, just trash it.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.049
Why are they throwing blood away?

12:39.134 --> 12:41.260
The people who work here are crazy.

12:41.344 --> 12:43.387
Did you notice that cologne earlier?

12:43.471 --> 12:46.682
Ugh, it's like he was trying
to be someone he's not.

12:47.559 --> 12:51.437
Clone? They're cloning people.

12:51.521 --> 12:53.230
I think all colognes smell weird.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.357
And they smell weird.

13:00.280 --> 13:03.699
-Psst, Bill.
-Ouch. I mean, what?

13:03.783 --> 13:05.409
Hey, guess what, dude?

13:05.493 --> 13:07.578
They won't even let me donate
any more pints,

13:07.662 --> 13:09.204
and I have to meet Dolph

13:09.289 --> 13:11.165
so he could co-headline
DeMamp Camp under me.

13:11.249 --> 13:15.461
So, I'm going to ask you
to take some blood from my arm.

13:15.545 --> 13:18.046
-Ew, gross.
-Bill.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.256
Don't be a bitch like Waymond.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.592
You're a fricking baller, right?

13:21.676 --> 13:24.386
I know you, you freaking baller.

13:24.471 --> 13:28.724
You freaking shot caller.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.893
Come with me. Be on my squad.

13:30.977 --> 13:33.562
Be on my team. Be part of DeMamp Camp.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.439
All right, I'll do it,

13:35.523 --> 13:37.900
but this baller's calling this shot.

13:37.984 --> 13:42.237
Me costarring in DeMamp Camp: Volume Two.

13:42.322 --> 13:45.115
Picture it, me, you, and Dolph,
the big muscle brothers.

13:45.200 --> 13:49.828
Oh, my God, I hate that idea, okay?

13:49.913 --> 13:52.164
But you're part of the team now.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.082
I freaking love you, Bill.
Let me kiss your head.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.168
Ew, it's all slimy. Come on.

14:04.260 --> 14:05.677
Excuse me.

14:05.762 --> 14:07.346
These three would like to give some blood.

14:07.430 --> 14:09.806
Oh, hey, getting it in before the deadline.

14:09.891 --> 14:12.476
-So, who's first?
-I'm ready to give.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.019
All right.

14:14.103 --> 14:15.687
-All right.
-Okay.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.105
Fill that out.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.774
I find the spirit is captured easiest

14:18.858 --> 14:21.026
between one's toes.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.028
I spent many moons chasing the dragon.

14:23.112 --> 14:24.696
-And by dragon...
-We know.

14:24.781 --> 14:26.281
-I mean heroin.
-Yup, that's apparent.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.491
All right, you're next big guy.

14:27.575 --> 14:29.952
Unhand me. I already gave.

14:30.036 --> 14:32.538
-See?
-So you took his blood earlier?

14:32.622 --> 14:33.705
No, he handed me a bag of blood

14:33.790 --> 14:35.123
that he said you drew.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.459
You don't remember? Remember me?

14:37.544 --> 14:39.044
What they talking about, Ders?

14:39.128 --> 14:41.129
- I gave blood, Ghostman.
- Where you going?

14:41.214 --> 14:42.339
I'm not going anywhere.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.132
Ghostman, get him.

14:44.217 --> 14:47.886
The drip is slowing way down.
That might be all your blood.

14:47.971 --> 14:50.180
What? No, we need five to win.

14:50.265 --> 14:52.891
Just squeeze my arm. Wring me out, Bill.

14:52.976 --> 14:54.851
"Wring me out, Bill," please.

14:54.936 --> 14:57.854
I might just be your costar,
but I'm not your slave.

15:00.942 --> 15:04.152
I am the fucking star,

15:04.237 --> 15:06.822
and I need you to wring me out,

15:06.906 --> 15:10.075
'cause my vision is me
bleeding everything I've got

15:10.159 --> 15:11.326
into this baggy.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.078
Then you got to sweeten my deal.

15:13.162 --> 15:17.291
I want 30% of merchandising
and a plus-two to the premiere.

15:17.375 --> 15:19.585
-Premiere's gonna be packed.
-I want to bring two dates.

15:19.669 --> 15:21.878
Mom and sis.

15:24.507 --> 15:25.966
Fine.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.600
Okay, all right.

15:34.684 --> 15:36.268
Go in there and destroy all the blood.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.770
-Okay, got it?
-I know. I know. I know.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.439
No, I am as serious as Sean Penn right now.

15:40.523 --> 15:42.316
You go in there and you destroy the blood.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.942
Otherwise, Dolph...

15:44.027 --> 15:46.028
He could make as many
universal soldiers as he wants,

15:46.112 --> 15:47.446
and I'm not talking movie sequels.

15:47.530 --> 15:48.864
I'm talking a clone army.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.616
He did it to Waymond and he did it to Carmen.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.492
Whoa. Okay, I'm on it.

15:52.577 --> 15:53.785
All right, get in there.

15:53.870 --> 15:55.412
Oh, how much of that bar did you eat?

15:55.496 --> 15:56.705
-I'm okay.
-You all right?

15:56.789 --> 15:58.457
It's just a little... See you.

15:58.541 --> 16:00.292
All right, be safe.

16:00.376 --> 16:02.294
Get 'em. Get 'em, girl.

16:14.849 --> 16:16.600
How you doing? Dumping the blood?

16:18.436 --> 16:20.103
Nope! Blake.

16:20.188 --> 16:22.439
What the heck?

16:22.523 --> 16:26.818
Cloning is the future and you can't stop it.

16:26.903 --> 16:29.696
Dolph needs this blood
to breed universal soldiers

16:29.781 --> 16:31.365
and I'm gonna help him.

16:31.449 --> 16:33.367
You're pro-cloning. Why?

16:33.451 --> 16:35.994
Mostly because I'm in love with him.

16:36.079 --> 16:38.413
But also have you seen
the movie Multiplicity?

16:38.498 --> 16:40.707
-It's really good.
-No, no, no, wait.

16:40.792 --> 16:42.501
If you start playing God,

16:42.585 --> 16:44.628
consequences will never be the same.

16:44.712 --> 16:47.714
And of course I've seen it!
It's a really, really great movie.

16:47.799 --> 16:50.300
But this... This ain't the movies, babe.

16:50.385 --> 16:52.552
- No.

16:52.637 --> 16:55.681
Don't! Stop! My Dolph! My sweet Dolph!

16:55.765 --> 16:57.849
What the bloody hell?

16:57.934 --> 17:01.436
Adam, Dolph is using
the blood drive to clone people.

17:01.521 --> 17:05.357
He's making a clone army.
He'll make a million Adams.

17:05.441 --> 17:07.067
That sounds awesome.

17:07.151 --> 17:08.860
A million Adams and a million Dolphs.

17:08.945 --> 17:10.862
And a million Bills.

17:10.947 --> 17:14.366
Okay, not a million Bills,
'cause you're off the project.

17:14.450 --> 17:17.494
Blake, don't do this to me, man, okay?

17:17.578 --> 17:19.371
I need this.

17:19.455 --> 17:20.706
Hey!

17:20.790 --> 17:21.998
Blake!

17:24.752 --> 17:27.003
I don't even have any blood in my body.

17:27.088 --> 17:28.046
-What's wrong with him?
-Adam?

17:28.131 --> 17:29.840
- What's wrong with him?

17:29.924 --> 17:32.175
It's probably all the blood that I gave.
Fuck.

17:34.095 --> 17:35.721
This is for your own good, man.

17:35.805 --> 17:39.224
Don't. If you pop one more of those,
I swear to God...

17:39.308 --> 17:41.685
- Blake.
- Don't, Blake!

17:51.404 --> 17:53.321
Oh, my God, did you... Did you kill this man?

17:53.406 --> 17:54.531
No, no, no, no.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.324
He just gave five pints of blood

17:56.409 --> 17:57.743
because he fell for your little scam,

17:57.827 --> 17:59.161
but I didn't.

17:59.245 --> 18:00.412
I destroyed all y'all's blood,

18:00.496 --> 18:03.081
because I know that Dolph Lundgren
was cloning people.

18:03.166 --> 18:04.541
-Ah.
-What?

18:04.625 --> 18:06.418
I figured it out like a little detective.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.754
Okay, um... Okay.

18:08.838 --> 18:10.922
Get me a pint of O-positive, stat.

18:11.007 --> 18:12.424
-This man needs blood.
-Okay.

18:12.508 --> 18:14.593
All the blood is gone. What are we gonna do?

18:14.677 --> 18:16.178
Um, uh...

18:16.262 --> 18:18.513
We're gonna need to try a direct transfusion.

18:18.598 --> 18:21.057
See, I knew your ass was trouble.

18:21.142 --> 18:22.768
The reason why we put your blood
to the side is 'cause

18:22.852 --> 18:24.227
there's no telling what
the hell you got up in there,

18:24.312 --> 18:25.353
all high and shit.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.522
I'm not high.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.065
You guys, I can't. I'm serious.

18:29.150 --> 18:30.358
This is how they killed that guy in Gremlins.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.277
Okay, okay. Are any of you AB or O?

18:32.361 --> 18:33.779
Maybe.

18:33.863 --> 18:35.155
Your friend just lost, like, a lot of blood.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.199
If you don't give right now,
like, he might not make it.

18:37.283 --> 18:38.825
-Where's this needle?
-Okay, good.

18:38.910 --> 18:40.452
I'll give.

18:42.872 --> 18:44.080
Oof! What the...

18:44.165 --> 18:46.416
-Okay, now we're screwed.
-Okay, what the fuck?

18:46.501 --> 18:48.418
I have been waiting all day
for my appointment.

18:48.503 --> 18:50.712
-Well, what blood type are you?
-AB, why?

18:50.797 --> 18:53.256
Okay, we are gonna need to do
an emergency direct transfusion

18:53.341 --> 18:54.883
between the two of you.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.135
Ugh, all right, fine,
but how long is this gonna take?

18:57.220 --> 18:58.595
I gotta Skype in 20.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.556
You're very lucky.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.642
You survived a highly unorthodox transfusion

19:03.726 --> 19:06.061
performed by poorly trained
volunteer nurses.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.730
-But did it work, though?
-All right.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.774
Come on, you need to wait outside, ma'am.

19:10.858 --> 19:12.317
I'm just saying, did it not work?

19:12.401 --> 19:14.152
-Outside.
-Whoa.

19:14.237 --> 19:18.156
Listen, I am Carmen
and I'm trying to start over.

19:18.241 --> 19:21.493
-Please don't ruin this for me.
-Hey.

19:21.577 --> 19:23.078
Secret's safe with me.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.330
It's not the 10-year contract we wanted,

19:25.414 --> 19:28.667
but here's an autographed napkin.

19:28.751 --> 19:32.212
And who is this? I missed Dolph?

19:32.296 --> 19:34.840
He stopped by TAC 'cause
he heard what happened to you,

19:34.924 --> 19:36.925
trying to give blood and all and felt bad.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.510
And he freaking didn't even come here

19:38.594 --> 19:41.012
and talk to me face to face?

19:41.097 --> 19:42.430
What a bitch.

19:42.515 --> 19:45.058
Best moment of that idiot's life
was getting his ass kicked

19:45.142 --> 19:46.434
by Jean-Claude Van Damme.

19:46.519 --> 19:49.521
-Stop.
-He's a fricking bitch. What a stupid bitch.

19:51.107 --> 19:52.774
He's right behind me, isn't he?

19:53.609 --> 19:57.863
Nope, he's right behind me.
You're looking at him.

19:59.949 --> 20:03.076
-Hi.
-Hi.

20:04.453 --> 20:07.747
You must've just heard that long story I told.

20:07.832 --> 20:11.209
I heard it. I heard you, man.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.420
I never meant to hurt you.

20:13.504 --> 20:15.922
Good-bye forever.

20:16.007 --> 20:17.799
Oh, my God, that was crazy.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.968
Oh, wait. My question.

20:20.052 --> 20:23.054
Do you still have, like, the voice of an angel?

20:23.139 --> 20:25.724
Uh, could you sing us a tune?

20:25.808 --> 20:28.602
Please.

20:28.686 --> 20:33.773
Ooh, ee, ooh

20:33.858 --> 20:35.400
Mr. Lundgren, wait.

20:35.484 --> 20:38.194
I've waited 15 years to ask you this question.

20:38.279 --> 20:40.572
So, in the movie Showdown in Little Tokyo,

20:40.656 --> 20:43.992
when you guys ate sushi
off those naked ladies,

20:44.076 --> 20:46.745
were those real naked ladies?

20:46.829 --> 20:49.706
Uh, yeah.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.958
Obviously.

20:52.043 --> 20:53.585
Yes! I knew it.

20:53.669 --> 20:54.878
I knew it. I knew it.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.671
You guys, they were real naked ladies!

21:02.094 --> 21:04.596
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

21:04.680 --> 21:07.349
Ee, ooh

21:10.853 --> 21:13.939
Ooh, ee, ooh

21:14.023 --> 21:16.858
--I'm so...
