00:00.918 --> 00:02.499
NATHAN: Previously on Haven...

00:02.587 --> 00:04.373
You've been falsifying police reports.

00:04.505 --> 00:07.247
I've been doing
what we've always done in Haven.

00:07.425 --> 00:09.256
We're gonna be looking
for a new chief immediately.

00:09.385 --> 00:11.842
Someone wants me out? It's the Rev, isn't it?

00:11.929 --> 00:13.339
He wants to be chief?

00:13.431 --> 00:15.012
He wants to control whoever is.

00:15.099 --> 00:18.091
Nathan, your father chose
to live among the cursed.

00:18.352 --> 00:21.435
Seek forgiveness. I can help you.

00:21.731 --> 00:25.098
Everyone else in this town
is fawning over me. Except you.

00:25.193 --> 00:26.774
He's kind of a jerk.

00:27.612 --> 00:29.193
You are amazing.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.692
I want you, Audrey, because you're you.

00:32.909 --> 00:34.194
You have no business here.

00:34.285 --> 00:36.776
This is Haven.
Making things disappear is my business.

00:36.954 --> 00:39.070
-This is Evi.
-l'm Duke's wife.

00:39.248 --> 00:41.113
-Why are you even here?
-lt's my dad.

00:41.250 --> 00:42.865
The old bastard made me swear

00:42.960 --> 00:45.121
that I would come back here
if The Troubles ever returned.

00:45.213 --> 00:46.794
And then he died.

00:47.256 --> 00:48.792
I don't know who killed your father.

00:48.883 --> 00:51.795
But if you wanna stay alive,
I suggest you stay out of his business.

00:51.886 --> 00:53.467
Duke doesn't suspect anything?

00:53.596 --> 00:54.711
No.

00:54.805 --> 00:57.547
And now that he knows
his father was murdered,

00:57.642 --> 00:59.257
you've got him.

01:09.070 --> 01:11.937
-Hi, Cathy. How's the little man today?
-Hi, Nathan.

01:12.031 --> 01:14.113
-Hey, little guy.
-He's good.

01:15.785 --> 01:18.697
-Good to see you, Martha.
-You, too, Nathan.

01:26.170 --> 01:29.333
Not the first time we've caught you
breaking and entering, Dwight.

01:30.424 --> 01:31.504
Caught me?

01:33.177 --> 01:34.633
Chief Wuornos can clear this up.

01:34.845 --> 01:36.927
You haven't heard.

01:37.014 --> 01:40.381
Wuornos isn't chief any more.
We got a new guy.

01:40.935 --> 01:45.349
So no more special treatment
for special people, you know?

01:47.316 --> 01:49.147
-Are you sweating?
-lt's warm out here.

01:49.527 --> 01:50.858
I wouldn't say that.

01:52.196 --> 01:53.481
Dwight.

01:55.741 --> 01:57.072
What's this?

01:57.368 --> 01:59.984
Did a little clean-up
at the Central Coast Meat Packing.

02:01.330 --> 02:02.615
With a crossbow?

02:04.292 --> 02:06.374
I got this from now, Paul.

02:09.046 --> 02:10.206
PAUL: Fine.

02:10.339 --> 02:11.875
Paul.

02:13.718 --> 02:14.958
Cuffs.

02:26.689 --> 02:27.895
So, there's a new chief?

02:28.024 --> 02:30.891
Yeah. The selectmen sent in this guy, Merrill.

02:31.027 --> 02:34.315
He's a reformer from Brunswick,
and I think he's clueless about The Troubles.

02:34.405 --> 02:36.191
Won't be for long.

02:36.574 --> 02:38.314
-Sprinkles?
-Yeah.

02:40.202 --> 02:42.659
Just watch where you point this thing.

03:03.267 --> 03:06.054
(EXCLAIMING SOFTLY)
What did I catch in that place?

03:11.692 --> 03:14.104
What the hell?

03:39.553 --> 03:42.465
All right, so you're okay
with taking the graveyard shift tonight?

03:42.556 --> 03:43.887
-Mmm-hmm.
-(SCOFFS)

03:43.974 --> 03:46.465
It's gonna be good. I'm not in charge.

03:46.560 --> 03:50.144
And most of Haven's
up at the boat parade, so go,

03:50.231 --> 03:51.812
go on your date.

03:51.941 --> 03:54.057
-lt's not a date.
-No, sure. Of course.

03:54.151 --> 03:57.063
That's why I've never seen you so nervous.
Because of your non-date.

03:57.154 --> 03:59.145
It's just, it's been...

03:59.240 --> 04:01.822
It's been, what, a month
since Chris left for London,

04:01.951 --> 04:05.239
and his trouble was still,
you know, relatively new.

04:05.329 --> 04:09.663
Right, and people, people see Chris
and then they're immediately very

04:09.792 --> 04:11.077
fond of him.

04:11.168 --> 04:13.659
It's nothing to worry about.

04:13.754 --> 04:14.994
-No?
-No.

04:16.132 --> 04:17.167
(SCOFFS) No.

04:17.299 --> 04:19.085
LAVERNE: Got a visitor up front, hon.

04:19.176 --> 04:21.963
-Thanks.
-/t’s for Nathan. Crocker’s here.

04:31.021 --> 04:33.182
You know that I hate that you're a cop, right?

04:33.315 --> 04:34.816
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

04:35.401 --> 04:38.689
And that I think it's ridiculous
that they put you in charge of this place?

04:38.821 --> 04:39.856
Uh-huh.

04:40.573 --> 04:42.689
But for certain reasons,

04:43.659 --> 04:44.899
it makes sense.

04:45.035 --> 04:48.118
Well, I'm not the chief
any more, you remember?

04:48.205 --> 04:49.411
Yeah.

04:53.252 --> 04:57.040
Do you wanna know why
you're not the chief any more?

04:57.882 --> 04:59.167
Evi.

04:59.717 --> 05:03.460
She tipped off the Rev about your file
on the troubled people.

05:03.554 --> 05:05.510
I saw it on her phone.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.716
I knew it was the Rev.

05:10.394 --> 05:13.761
-But how the hell is Evi involved?
-You got me.

05:14.607 --> 05:17.064
I mean, think howl feel. I'm married to her.

05:17.193 --> 05:19.730
God only knows what else she's hiding.

05:22.239 --> 05:26.573
Look, I figure we do this here,
othenNise she'd bolt.

05:28.245 --> 05:32.284
I told her that you were helping me
with my parking tickets.

05:32.917 --> 05:35.283
It was the best I could come up with.

05:35.419 --> 05:38.126
Okay. Let's put her in the break room.

05:41.550 --> 05:42.585
(DUKE STUTTERS)

05:45.304 --> 05:47.260
What the hell is that?

05:51.101 --> 05:54.059
Did Duke finally pay his parking tickets?

05:56.273 --> 05:57.433
Mmm. Oh!

05:57.566 --> 05:58.601
Yeah.

05:58.984 --> 06:00.269

06:01.070 --> 06:04.483
-Ohl Right. Workplace.
-Yeah.

06:08.327 --> 06:09.783
I guess I just don't care.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.540
-Okay, hey, hey, hey.
-What?

06:13.624 --> 06:17.788
Why don't I just grab my stuff,
and then we can go to the parade?

06:18.837 --> 06:20.168
Parade?

06:21.298 --> 06:24.461
With boats and lights
and drinking and people?

06:24.802 --> 06:26.167
-Yeah.
-No.

06:26.512 --> 06:27.752
I don't wanna see anyone but you.

(INTERCOM BEEPING)

06:29.682 --> 06:31.798
STAN: Parker, you’d better get out here.

06:32.685 --> 06:33.970
I gotta...

06:34.061 --> 06:37.144
No, no, we got plans.
This better not be important.

06:38.649 --> 06:41.311
I love that you don't listen to me!

06:51.537 --> 06:53.368
That's Officer Stark.

06:58.836 --> 07:00.326
He's dead.

07:54.183 --> 07:55.548
NATHAN: ljust saw him.

07:55.684 --> 07:58.471
He looked pale and sweaty, but not...

07:58.562 --> 08:00.063
Not as dead?

08:00.606 --> 08:03.393
'Cause he's pretty dead.

08:03.567 --> 08:06.559
Look, his veins are... They're black.

08:08.614 --> 08:10.570
What the hell is this?

08:11.617 --> 08:12.902
Is that one of my officers?

08:14.411 --> 08:16.276
That's Chief Merrill.

08:17.915 --> 08:20.748
-And who are you?
-I am...

08:23.420 --> 08:24.626
Nobody.

could cause something like this?

08:29.968 --> 08:31.799
MERRILL: Maybe a chemical weapon.

08:32.262 --> 08:34.344
We're not a target for anything like that.

08:34.431 --> 08:37.923
We may wanna consider other possibilities.

08:38.060 --> 08:40.426
Are you saying this town
doesn't have any local fanatics?

08:41.271 --> 08:43.478
Groups with a reason to target
the Haven police department?

08:44.316 --> 08:46.398
I suggest you look into that right now.

08:49.113 --> 08:50.944
(INDISTINCT TALKING)

08:52.950 --> 08:54.440
This isn't the Pentagon.

08:54.785 --> 08:57.618

in Haven?

08:57.746 --> 09:00.783
The more people know about the troubled,
the more afraid they are.

09:02.334 --> 09:03.995
Do you think the Rev is whipping them up?

09:04.128 --> 09:06.414
Dukejust told me that the Rev got me fired.

09:06.505 --> 09:08.336
(WHISPERING) Are you kidding me?

09:08.465 --> 09:10.251
I knew he'd try and get me out eventually.

09:10.342 --> 09:12.082
Itjust happened sooner than I expected.

09:12.469 --> 09:15.131
All right, so the Rev gets his chief.

09:15.597 --> 09:17.007
Why attack the department now?

09:17.349 --> 09:19.965
Unless the perp is someone
unhappy about Merrill.

09:20.185 --> 09:22.301
You get replaced. You do have your fans.

09:22.771 --> 09:24.978
You think it's someone pro-troubled,

09:25.816 --> 09:29.479
with technical know-how,
access to chemicals?

09:29.945 --> 09:31.856
The last person Paul arrested was Dwight.

09:31.989 --> 09:33.149
Yeah, your dad's cleaner.

09:33.282 --> 09:34.863
We really don't know that much about him.

09:35.451 --> 09:37.407
-DWIGHT: He's dead?
-NATHAN: Maybe you had a grudge.

09:37.494 --> 09:40.702
Nathan, listen, I didn't
do anything to that guy, okay?

09:41.331 --> 09:42.832
You really need to start trusting me.

09:42.958 --> 09:45.324
With a new chief in town,
you might need me more than ever.

09:53.218 --> 09:55.675
-We're gonna do this now?
-Wait.

09:56.180 --> 09:59.172
Evi, show him what you showed me.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.732
It starts at the extremities.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.738
We gotta get her to the hospital.

10:17.451 --> 10:18.816
How long has she been like this?

10:18.911 --> 10:21.197
Excuse me. She's standing right here.

10:21.622 --> 10:22.862
Duke, what's happening?

10:23.081 --> 10:25.367
Were you and Parker able
to locate the chemical source?

10:25.918 --> 10:27.704
No, not yet, sir.

10:28.045 --> 10:29.876
Did you have any direct contact
with Officer Stark?

10:29.963 --> 10:32.170
Shake his hand, sit at his desk, anything?

10:32.257 --> 10:33.542
No.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.249
But this thing keeps spreading.

10:36.094 --> 10:38.585
So it's gotta be biological and airborne.

10:39.389 --> 10:40.424
Sir.

10:40.557 --> 10:42.138
Ma'am, I'll need you back
in the break room right now.

10:42.226 --> 10:43.887
-Wait a minute, Chief.
-Nowl

10:47.940 --> 10:49.430
Ladies and gentlemen,

10:49.566 --> 10:51.773
we may have a biological agent
in the building,

10:51.902 --> 10:54.268
which means we follow procedure.

10:54.404 --> 10:57.441
We cannot allow the contamination
to spread further.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.860
So until this situation is resolved,

10:59.952 --> 11:04.195
nobody, and I mean nobody,
goes in or out of this building.

11:04.289 --> 11:06.780
The Haven police station
is now under quarantine.

11:07.668 --> 11:08.953
This is a Iockdown.

11:20.305 --> 11:22.045
MERRILL: This thing is contained.
Absolutely.

11:22.307 --> 11:24.218
No one's leaving the building until it's clear.

11:26.395 --> 11:28.306
I'll do whatever has to be done.

11:31.650 --> 11:34.642
Copy that. I'll await further instruction.

11:39.241 --> 11:41.402
What do the state police have to say?

11:43.912 --> 11:46.449
That we're doing the right thing.

11:46.540 --> 11:49.122
The contagion hasn't spread
beyond the police station.

11:53.005 --> 11:55.963
Like you asked,
it's a list of everyone in the station.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.459
It's a small group.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.460
Hugh UndenNood, he's a doctor?

12:01.680 --> 12:03.716
He said he'd look at the body,
check on the sick.

12:04.308 --> 12:05.514
Good.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.392
Have the officers keep an eye on everybody.

12:09.563 --> 12:11.724
Sir, the people out there
are scared for their lives.

12:11.982 --> 12:14.815
Well, that's to be expected.
That's why we have to maintain order.

12:15.527 --> 12:19.896
I put lock codes on all the doors.
All the landlines are shut down.

12:19.990 --> 12:21.981
I want you to confiscate
everybody's cell phone.

12:22.492 --> 12:24.323
People will wanna stay
in touch with their families.

12:24.494 --> 12:25.995
And I'll need you
and the rest of the department

12:26.079 --> 12:27.785
-to surrender your weapons.
-What?

12:27.873 --> 12:30.831
They'll be placed in a locker
under my own personal access code.

12:30.918 --> 12:34.081
We can't afford someone panicking,
doing something rash.

12:35.714 --> 12:37.579
This isn't optional.

12:53.523 --> 12:54.854
CHRIS: We can leave anytime.

12:55.025 --> 12:57.607
I'll just use my irresistible charm
on your new boss.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.226
It's resistible.

13:02.908 --> 13:04.023
CHRIS: What are you doing?

13:04.284 --> 13:07.617
Just a little insurance in case, you know,
Merrill starts searching the offices.

13:07.704 --> 13:09.911
I wanna make sure
I can find at least one gun.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.280
-Parker, you called?
-Yeah.

13:12.542 --> 13:14.157
Stan, you and the desk sarge,

13:14.252 --> 13:16.208
you're the only one with access
to the evidence room, right?

13:16.380 --> 13:17.495
Right.

13:17.589 --> 13:19.420
Book this in evidence and keep it that way.

13:19.549 --> 13:20.800
You got it.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.843
Can you tell what's happened to him?

13:32.938 --> 13:37.898
Well, it's strange, this dark blood.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.729
I know what your chief said,

13:40.821 --> 13:42.732
but chemical weapons,
they don't act like this.

13:42.948 --> 13:45.064
-Do you think it's a virus?
-No.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.566
No, viruses don't move
with this kind of speed.

13:47.744 --> 13:50.156
It's not like any poison I've ever seen.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.571
It's like nothing
on the known medical record.

13:52.958 --> 13:54.949
All right. Thank you, Dr. UndenNood.

13:55.085 --> 13:57.076
Hey, call me Hugh.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.835
I don't think Haven's
in the known medical record.

14:03.010 --> 14:04.090
It's gotta be The Troubles.

14:04.511 --> 14:07.423
So whose affliction
is spreading this disease?

14:08.098 --> 14:09.178
(LOCKS DOOR)

14:09.307 --> 14:12.344
The person is probably still in the station.

14:12.436 --> 14:15.143
They could be infecting whoever
they're coming in contact with.

14:15.480 --> 14:18.222
Okay, so this happened,
what, about 45 minutes ago,

14:18.316 --> 14:19.726
and we've already got a new case?

14:19.818 --> 14:22.855
That means that all of us could be sick
within a matter of hours.

14:23.447 --> 14:24.812
I'm gonna go ahead and check on Evi.

14:25.157 --> 14:26.442
Dwight, it's Nathan. Do you read?

14:26.992 --> 14:31.156
Wow. Outside contact.
I'm gonna tell the new chief on you.

14:37.461 --> 14:38.541
Dwight.

14:39.171 --> 14:41.207
About time.
What the hell's going on up there?

14:41.298 --> 14:42.959
We got some kind of outbreak here.

14:43.050 --> 14:44.665
My buddy from the state police called.

14:44.801 --> 14:47.634
Said they got a tipoff.
Any call from Haven's a prank.

14:47.721 --> 14:49.131
CDC got the same warning.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.429
/ ﬁgured there was something
you were trying to keep quiet.

14:51.516 --> 14:53.552
No, I guess somebody is.

14:54.686 --> 14:56.301
We're cut off completely.

14:56.563 --> 14:57.803
Think someone planned this?

14:58.023 --> 15:01.140
I don't know. Just stay by the radio.
Right now, you're my only backup.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.485
Roger that.

15:09.868 --> 15:11.984
Hey, I checked on Evi. She's getting worse.

15:12.079 --> 15:14.070
And now this other woman's got it, too.

15:14.164 --> 15:17.201
Somebody called off
the state police and the CDC.

15:17.334 --> 15:18.995
What? Why?

15:19.086 --> 15:22.203
I'm more interested in who wants us cut off.

15:23.006 --> 15:25.497
Do you think that Merrill's troubled?

15:25.592 --> 15:28.208
You don't think the Rev
would vet his new pick for chief?

15:28.428 --> 15:30.510
Okay, look, it's not like
there's a test, all right?

15:30.597 --> 15:33.054
Maybe he's isolating us to cover his tracks.

15:33.350 --> 15:35.887
We gotta be smart,
try and reason with him first.

15:38.772 --> 15:41.104
Any person leaving this building
will be shot on sight.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.230
Shot? By who?

15:43.527 --> 15:45.188
This is an outbreak.

15:45.779 --> 15:48.191
It needs to be contained.

15:48.448 --> 15:51.406
There are armed men outside this building
who will shoot anyone seen leaving,

15:51.535 --> 15:54.026
and they will only stand down on my order.

15:54.204 --> 15:55.284
Who the hell are you?

15:55.372 --> 15:58.114
I'm the guy bringing this place under control.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.207
Okay, sir,

16:01.378 --> 16:05.587
have you ever considered the possibility
that maybe you're the one causing this?

16:05.882 --> 16:07.042
You think I'm troubled?

16:08.552 --> 16:10.884
The troubled are why I'm here.

16:11.930 --> 16:13.921
People are sick and tired
of a town that looks the other way

16:14.057 --> 16:15.467
while the troubled break the law.

16:16.226 --> 16:17.762
The Rev brought you here, didn't he?

16:17.894 --> 16:19.930
I'm here to enforce the law.

16:20.063 --> 16:21.428
AUDREY 1: Oh, my God. Sir.

16:21.565 --> 16:24.147
To treat the troubled for what they are,
criminals!

16:25.277 --> 16:28.110
We have to maintain order.
We have to contain this.

16:29.072 --> 16:31.438
(STRAINING) No one is leaving here until...

16:38.748 --> 16:39.908
(GAGS)

16:42.127 --> 16:43.412
Damn it.

16:45.422 --> 16:47.253
Your kind won't win.

17:04.858 --> 17:07.770
For now, let's go ahead and put him
in the bathroom with Paul.

17:08.195 --> 17:09.856
Merrill's cell phone.

17:09.946 --> 17:11.322
Password protected, of course,

17:11.448 --> 17:13.689
but he must have known
he was infected this whole time.

17:13.783 --> 17:15.489
Maybe he really did wanna
contain the outbreak.

17:15.660 --> 17:18.151
Or he was terrified by whoever
was giving him orders.

17:19.789 --> 17:22.075
Dwight. You see anybody out there?

17:22.167 --> 17:24.453
Affirmative. I'm not the only one
watching the station.

17:24.669 --> 17:26.830
You got two armed with handguns
on the perimeter.

17:27.005 --> 17:29.462
At least one on the rooftop
of the post office across the street

17:29.549 --> 17:30.709
packing a sniper rifle.

17:31.301 --> 17:33.883
Head over to the Sheriff's department,
see if you can get us some backup.

17:33.970 --> 17:35.301
Will do.

17:41.978 --> 17:43.388
Got Merrill's access card.

17:43.647 --> 17:46.480
We can override the electronic locks.
We can get out of here.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.477
Of course, we can't really use it.

17:48.652 --> 17:51.143
I mean, even if these guys outside
are just for show,

17:51.321 --> 17:53.733
we can't let this thing out,
it could wipe out all of Haven.

17:53.990 --> 17:56.322
Okay, it looks like this thing
kills people in a few hours,

17:56.409 --> 17:58.274
so we really don't have that much time.

17:58.995 --> 18:02.783
I'm probably immune, I'm just gonna
start interviewing people one by one.

18:03.041 --> 18:05.032
Except Evi. She's mine.

18:08.004 --> 18:10.120
I need to get to a hospital.

18:10.298 --> 18:12.459
We can't risk letting you out there.

18:12.717 --> 18:15.333
We don't know if you're contagious.

18:17.180 --> 18:18.636
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

18:27.190 --> 18:28.555
Evi,

18:30.527 --> 18:32.563
it's not the only reason why I'm here.

18:34.698 --> 18:38.316
I need to know why you sold
me out to the selectmen?

18:38.410 --> 18:40.366
Got me fired as chief?

18:40.745 --> 18:42.485
Why are you working with the Rev?

18:42.580 --> 18:44.662
-How'd you find out?
-Duke.

18:46.710 --> 18:48.371
He saw your text message.

18:48.503 --> 18:49.709
(SCOFFS)

18:51.423 --> 18:54.210
That's why he's been acting so strange.

18:54.676 --> 18:58.089
Look, this wasn't personal. I got in too deep.

18:58.888 --> 19:01.550
And that's when they asked me
to do that thing with your files.

19:01.725 --> 19:04.592
-Who's they? The Rev?
-He's one of them.

19:04.894 --> 19:08.136
Why is it so important
to have me out of the way?

19:08.231 --> 19:10.517
Because they said it would be helping Duke.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.269
-Explain it to me.
-I can't.

19:12.569 --> 19:14.434
Then, explain it to me.

19:27.751 --> 19:28.786
(SIGHS)

19:29.919 --> 19:32.956
I'm sorry, these men,
they said that I'd be helping you.

19:33.381 --> 19:35.542
How does getting Nathan fired
possibly help me?

19:35.633 --> 19:39.626
I don't know, okay?
They said that you were important.

19:39.763 --> 19:41.799
And that you needed to learn certain things,

19:41.931 --> 19:45.298
and Nathan needed to be out of the way
because he'd be a problem for you.

19:46.436 --> 19:47.425
(SIGHS)

19:55.779 --> 19:58.612
How naive are you?

20:01.284 --> 20:03.650
-Or did they just pay you a lot of money?
-Oh, my God.

20:03.787 --> 20:06.403
It's not about the money.
I believed them, okay?

20:06.498 --> 20:09.035
I believed them
because they told me something

20:09.125 --> 20:10.626
that I always knew.

20:11.169 --> 20:12.579
You're special.

20:12.670 --> 20:13.750
Mmm?

20:14.589 --> 20:16.955
And what makes me so special?

20:17.092 --> 20:20.676
All I know is that
whatever's going on in this town,

20:20.804 --> 20:22.089
they think that you're in the middle of it.

20:22.180 --> 20:24.136
What? Tell me!

20:25.266 --> 20:28.099
-Tell me!
-I can't! I'm telling you what I know!

20:28.186 --> 20:30.518
After everything,
you owe me some real answers.

20:31.773 --> 20:32.853
So, what?

20:32.982 --> 20:36.224
Everything that's happened between us
was controlled by them?

20:36.319 --> 20:39.186
-No. No.
-You could die.

20:40.198 --> 20:42.189
We all could die.

20:43.660 --> 20:46.993
There are men out there with guns,
stopping us from leaving.

20:48.498 --> 20:49.829
(SNIFFLES)

20:50.500 --> 20:52.286
Even with all that,

20:55.380 --> 20:57.996
you still can't tell me the truth.

21:06.891 --> 21:08.506
(DOOR SLAMMING)

21:08.852 --> 21:09.967
(SOFTLY) God.

21:28.621 --> 21:29.656
(EXCLAIMS SOFTLY)

21:40.550 --> 21:41.790
Nikki Coleman.

21:41.885 --> 21:45.127
I came in to file
a building permit for my boss.

21:45.221 --> 21:48.884
Okay, great. And did you talk
to Chief Merrill or Officer Stark?

21:49.225 --> 21:50.476
I talked with everyone.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.801
They kept telling me to fill out more forms.

21:52.896 --> 21:54.306
Does this mean we can go now?

21:54.397 --> 21:57.889
Yeah, soon. Can you just go ahead
and send in the next person?

21:58.735 --> 21:59.975
Yeah.

22:05.742 --> 22:08.404
This is ridiculous.
Do we really have to do this?

22:09.037 --> 22:12.074
Well, you know I can't make it look
like you're getting special treatment.

22:12.665 --> 22:16.908
Fine. I'll make it easy for you.
It's not me. Now can I go?

22:17.003 --> 22:18.413
I've got a killer game of solitaire going.

22:18.546 --> 22:20.332
It's the only card game
where nobody lets me win.

22:20.423 --> 22:22.835
Have you seen Evi?
She's missing. Duke's worried.

22:23.259 --> 22:24.760
Well, she can't be that far.

22:26.012 --> 22:27.252
NATHAN: The key card's gone.

22:27.388 --> 22:28.594
Evi must have it.

22:32.560 --> 22:33.595
(BEEPS)

22:35.438 --> 22:37.019
Someone is exiting the building.

22:38.358 --> 22:40.440
-(SHOUTING) Where are you?
-SNIPER: Yeah, I got her on target.

22:40.944 --> 22:42.354
-Evi.
-EVI: I know you're out here!

22:42.445 --> 22:44.276
-Come on!
-Evi, stop!

22:44.405 --> 22:47.272
-Please, just come back inside.
-No. I got out for you.

22:48.743 --> 22:51.860
I could run, but I'm not gonna run any more.

22:52.121 --> 22:54.533
You want answers, I'll get you your answers.

22:56.626 --> 22:57.706
Evi!

22:57.794 --> 22:58.874
(BEEPS)

22:58.962 --> 23:01.248
-Go back in the building.
-No!

23:01.339 --> 23:03.170
You're gonna tell him what he wants to know.

23:03.258 --> 23:04.293
(GUN FIRES)

23:04.384 --> 23:05.840
Evi!

23:07.262 --> 23:08.752
MAN: Hold yourfire! Not him!

23:11.266 --> 23:13.006
It's okay. You're gonna be okay.

23:17.355 --> 23:18.891
You're gonna be all right.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.148
AUDREY 1: Oh, God.

23:28.283 --> 23:30.444
I'm gonna go get some help.

23:32.453 --> 23:33.954
Why did you do that?

23:36.124 --> 23:37.830
I'm so sorry.

23:38.084 --> 23:40.541
Hang on. Help is on the way.

24:25.214 --> 24:26.624
No. No, Duke.

24:26.716 --> 24:28.172
Not like this.

24:29.886 --> 24:31.217
If you were ever my friend...

24:31.304 --> 24:33.465
You can'tjust run out there!
Be smarter than that.

24:33.556 --> 24:35.763
Nathan, get the hell out of my way!

24:36.184 --> 24:38.220
-Duke!
-Audrey, you...

24:38.353 --> 24:39.388
(GROANS)

24:41.439 --> 24:42.519
Nathan!

24:44.150 --> 24:46.106
ljust saved his life.

24:47.945 --> 24:51.153
Okay, I'm gonna go figure out
how to stop this.

25:19.686 --> 25:21.222
Nikki Coleman.

25:23.106 --> 25:24.971
AUDREY 1: You didn't mention
that Officer Stark made a call

25:25.066 --> 25:26.556
to your residence earlier today,

25:27.193 --> 25:29.024
that you were also in Chief Merrill's office,

25:29.696 --> 25:32.654
and now they're both dead,
three hours after they talked to you.

25:32.740 --> 25:35.903
I wanna help you, (WHISPERING)
but I can't be seen talking to you.

25:37.453 --> 25:39.364
-Audrey.
-Chris, not now.

25:39.455 --> 25:41.036
Then I guess I won't bother you with this.

25:41.499 --> 25:43.114
-Hello again.
-Hi.

25:44.544 --> 25:47.286
-You talked to Nikki, too?
-Yeah, she talked to me. Why?

25:49.674 --> 25:51.164
She's the one?

25:51.551 --> 25:54.418
Be a doll and clear this up, will you?
Do that voodoo that you do.

25:55.555 --> 25:56.795
I don't understand.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.595
You're the one that's causing this disease,

25:58.683 --> 26:00.639
-so just fix it, will you?
-Okay.

26:01.853 --> 26:04.265
-I haven't even told her yet.
-I'm dying.

26:04.355 --> 26:07.472
Give me five minutes with patient zero.
I'll have her healing Iepers. Look at her.

26:07.567 --> 26:09.273
She's practically in love with me.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.772
What has happened to you?
You've completely changed.

26:11.863 --> 26:13.148
Yeah, whatever. I'm going to the hospital.

26:13.239 --> 26:15.525
No, you can't leave, okay?
People out there will shoot you.

26:15.658 --> 26:18.320
-Nobody wants to shoot me.
-Really? You're a scientist.

26:18.411 --> 26:21.574
Tell me, what works faster,
your trouble or a bullet?

26:21.664 --> 26:24.747
Listen, I can save you, if you just
let me get through to this very scared,

26:24.834 --> 26:26.995
and now, thanks to you,
very confused woman.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.587
All right? Just let me do myjob.

26:28.671 --> 26:30.207
Man, I wish my affliction worked on you.

26:34.177 --> 26:37.544
Usually, a trouble like yours
is triggered by a traumatic event.

26:37.680 --> 26:40.012
Did something like that happen recently?

26:41.100 --> 26:42.340
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

26:43.895 --> 26:45.886
Please, you can tell me.

26:46.189 --> 26:47.895
(SHUDDERING) No, |...

26:48.357 --> 26:50.939
You don't see. I can't say anything.

26:53.196 --> 26:57.405
He's back.
And he'll hurt me again, kill me even.

26:59.035 --> 27:01.196
Is that why you called Officer Stark?

27:01.704 --> 27:03.911
Is that why you came down to the station?

27:04.207 --> 27:06.448
Because you're being abused?

27:13.716 --> 27:15.581
Okay, listen, that man that you're afraid of,

27:15.718 --> 27:18.334
he can't hurt you here. All right? You're safe.

27:18.429 --> 27:20.215
No, I'm never safe.

27:21.390 --> 27:24.723
You don't understand. I... It took me years.

27:25.895 --> 27:28.728
I ran away. I changed my name.

27:30.566 --> 27:32.352
Today, he found me.

27:34.070 --> 27:37.403
He said if I talk to the police, he'll kill me.

27:41.452 --> 27:42.737
Excuse me.

27:44.413 --> 27:45.949
Hi. I'm Hugh UndenNood.

27:46.123 --> 27:48.034
-I'm a doctor.
-Yeah, Chris Brody.

27:48.125 --> 27:50.741
I'd shake your hand,
but I'm pretty much dying.

27:51.254 --> 27:52.710
I'm sorry, Chris.

27:53.256 --> 27:56.589
I just saw you in there
with the detective and that Nikki woman.

27:56.717 --> 27:57.797
What's going on?

27:57.927 --> 28:00.669
My girlfriend, or whatever she is,
doesn't want me to leave.

28:00.763 --> 28:01.843
She's the detective.

28:01.931 --> 28:04.923
She's in there chatting up a storm
while I'm out here dying.

28:05.476 --> 28:07.091
I might be able to help you.

28:07.311 --> 28:11.600
If I can get you to the hospital in time,
I might be able to save your life.

28:11.732 --> 28:13.017
(WHISPERING) The only thing is,

28:13.109 --> 28:15.065
there's no way
they're gonna let us out of here othenNise.

28:15.444 --> 28:17.105
We're gonna need a gun or something.

28:22.493 --> 28:24.233
It's Stan, right?

28:25.162 --> 28:27.619
-Yeah. Thanks for remembering.
-Yeah. (CHUCKLING)

28:28.583 --> 28:32.747
Stan, Parker wanted me to get that
envelope that you put into evidence.

28:32.837 --> 28:34.293
Sure.

28:38.968 --> 28:42.586
I think that all of those years
that you spent absorbing that abuse,

28:42.680 --> 28:44.921
swallowing that poison,

28:45.016 --> 28:48.725
I think today, when he showed up,
it finally leaked out.

28:49.145 --> 28:51.306
It's been infecting all these people.

28:52.565 --> 28:55.398
Listen, if you tell me who he is,
we can confront him,

28:55.484 --> 28:58.100
and maybe we can end this thing.

28:58.404 --> 28:59.564
He's...

28:59.989 --> 29:02.651
He knows I'm here.
He knows I'm talking to you.

29:02.742 --> 29:07.327
No. How would he know that
unless he's...here?

29:08.164 --> 29:09.654
(NIKKI WHIMPERING)

29:10.625 --> 29:12.161
Excuse me, Officer.

29:12.418 --> 29:14.283
Mind if I have a word with my wife?

29:23.638 --> 29:26.175
-Get over there.
-All right. All right.

29:26.307 --> 29:28.298
Okay, you're in charge.

29:31.312 --> 29:32.677
Yes, I am.

29:39.362 --> 29:41.853
I've heard about the freaks in Haven,

29:45.660 --> 29:48.493
but creating a pestilence?

29:49.038 --> 29:50.323
You don't have to do this, Hugh.

29:50.539 --> 29:52.530
(SHOUTING) Well, now I do, don't I?

29:53.167 --> 29:55.453
Because she complained about me.

29:55.544 --> 29:57.455
She didn't do anything wrong.

29:58.339 --> 29:59.875
(NIKKI WHIMPERING)

30:00.007 --> 30:02.168
She did do one thing right.

30:02.635 --> 30:04.876
She gave everyone else the disease,
except me,

30:05.012 --> 30:07.128
and now they're all dying.

30:07.473 --> 30:08.633
Maybe

30:09.350 --> 30:12.342
that's because you know

30:13.938 --> 30:16.725
I'm the only one
who truly understands you, huh?

30:19.652 --> 30:21.017
(FAINTLY) Hey.

30:22.238 --> 30:23.444
Hugh.

30:23.990 --> 30:25.070
Buddy.

30:26.117 --> 30:27.232
Let's talk about this.

30:27.326 --> 30:29.738
Sit down. You've already done enough.
You already gave him my gun.

30:29.829 --> 30:33.321
Hey! Don't you talk to him like that.

30:37.670 --> 30:41.003
Maybe you need to be taught
a little respect. What do you think?

30:44.552 --> 30:46.133
Wait a second.

30:48.806 --> 30:51.297
How come you're not sick like the others?

30:58.274 --> 31:00.105
Nathan, come on.

31:01.277 --> 31:02.938
You can'tjust lock me in here.

31:03.487 --> 31:06.900
-|'m not gonna do anything.
-You're not thinking right.

31:07.616 --> 31:09.777
DWIGHT: Nathan, / got backup.
The Sheriff’s 10 minutes out.

31:10.202 --> 31:11.487
-Great.
-Not great.

31:11.579 --> 31:13.945
Our buddies out here must have
a scanner and heard the call go out.

31:14.206 --> 31:15.742
They’re gearing up.
Looks like they’re coming in.

31:16.083 --> 31:18.039
They wanna wipe us out
before help gets here.

31:18.127 --> 31:19.788
They’re coming in the back.
I’ve got you covered.

31:23.340 --> 31:24.671
Nathan.

31:25.217 --> 31:26.627
You gotta let me go with you.

31:27.303 --> 31:29.840
I'm not letting you get yourself killed.

31:29.930 --> 31:31.670
Nathan! Wait!

31:33.559 --> 31:35.845
Nathan, don't do this to me!

31:42.318 --> 31:45.776
I'm sorry. I can't let you live.

31:46.781 --> 31:48.612
You'll keep me away from my Nicole.

31:48.949 --> 31:50.109
Hey, come on, Doc.

31:51.827 --> 31:55.570
I get you. I understand why you're doing this.

31:57.291 --> 31:58.576
Sometimes it's...

31:58.667 --> 32:01.875
(WHISPERING): Isolating yourself,
feeling weak, that's what caused this.

32:01.962 --> 32:04.795
But what you have inside of you now,
you need to turn it around.

32:05.049 --> 32:07.961
-Fight back, Nikki.
-I can't. (SOBBING)

32:08.219 --> 32:09.675
You don't wanna see me die, do you?

32:12.723 --> 32:14.133
Listen, you're notjust hurting yourself.

32:14.225 --> 32:15.931
You're hurting everyone else here, okay?

32:17.478 --> 32:19.389
Find the strength, fight back.

32:19.480 --> 32:20.720
All right, that's enough out of you!

32:24.777 --> 32:26.017
Stop it, Hugh!

32:28.155 --> 32:29.361
No more.

32:34.912 --> 32:37.369
-What did you say?
-You heard me.

32:40.543 --> 32:42.249
Now, I'm gonna count to three,

32:42.878 --> 32:46.712
and you are gonna get on your knees
and apologize.

32:47.800 --> 32:48.880
No.

32:50.302 --> 32:53.760
You have poisoned me
with your abuse for years.

32:54.723 --> 32:56.054
I'm done.

32:56.725 --> 32:58.716
So kill me if you want.

32:58.978 --> 33:02.937
But I don't think you will
because you're nothing but a coward.

33:05.734 --> 33:07.395
Rot in hell.

33:29.008 --> 33:30.794
I did that to him.

33:31.010 --> 33:32.750
-I killed him.
-No.

33:32.845 --> 33:34.756
Listen, you saved us.

33:40.102 --> 33:41.808
Hey, it's over.

33:42.980 --> 33:44.766
Not for those guys outside.

33:44.857 --> 33:46.438
-They're coming in.
-Why?

33:46.525 --> 33:49.016
Wipe out the curse and everyone else.

33:51.280 --> 33:52.440
Okay.

33:52.948 --> 33:56.111
Well, go stop them. I'll try to find more guns.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.865
Dwight, do you copy?

34:08.005 --> 34:10.121
They're coming. Get back.

Dwight, you're shot.

34:38.327 --> 34:39.362
(DWIGHT GROANS)

34:42.206 --> 34:43.821
One grazed my neck.

34:44.375 --> 34:47.162
Let me guess,
you didn't catch a single bullet?

34:48.337 --> 34:51.750
Nothing hit the walls.
I'm not hit. I don't get it.

34:56.011 --> 34:59.378
Bullets, they tend to find me.

35:02.226 --> 35:03.432
It's a long story.

35:03.769 --> 35:05.851
Bullets tend to find you?

35:09.858 --> 35:10.938
That's your trouble?

35:16.448 --> 35:18.359
Well, you were right.

35:18.450 --> 35:21.908
The way things are going,
I might need you around more than ever.

35:57.573 --> 36:00.315
I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Crocker.

36:01.910 --> 36:03.366
I truly am.

36:04.288 --> 36:07.200
She didn't know anything about this town.

36:10.836 --> 36:14.954
She was one of the many
innocent victims of the troubled.

36:16.842 --> 36:19.049
I lost my wife to them, too.

36:25.893 --> 36:28.259
I don't understand any of this.

36:32.483 --> 36:34.724
I can help you, Mr. Crocker.

36:40.491 --> 36:42.777
But you're gonna have to prove to me
that you're worthy.

36:51.085 --> 36:52.165
Reverend.

37:00.552 --> 37:02.008
Thank you.

37:05.265 --> 37:07.005
I'll pray for her.

37:24.034 --> 37:26.446
Dwight, I need you to do something for me.

37:26.829 --> 37:30.162
Evi Ryan, make it look like a suicide
or an accident,

37:30.249 --> 37:32.456
just as long as the case is closed.

37:32.543 --> 37:36.001
We're not talking about covering up
a supernatural event.

37:36.088 --> 37:37.373
This is a murder.

37:37.464 --> 37:40.297
We can't investigate this with the
state police looking over our shoulder.

37:40.384 --> 37:43.876
Evi was shot in the chest.
She has black veins in her arms.

37:43.971 --> 37:46.087
-The medical examiner's never...
-DWIGHT: No problem.

37:47.933 --> 37:50.515
Wouldn't be the toughest thing I ever had.

37:51.854 --> 37:53.310
If it's okay with you, Chief.

37:57.359 --> 37:59.099
If you're gonna do that...

37:59.778 --> 38:01.018
Do it.

38:01.780 --> 38:05.272
One more thing,
we got Chief Merrill's cell phone logs.

38:05.367 --> 38:08.029
Guess who he talked to
half a dozen times during the Iockdown?

38:08.120 --> 38:09.200
The Rev?

38:14.877 --> 38:16.617
He's in the middle of all of this.

38:54.416 --> 38:57.408
Sorry. I got caught up at work.

38:57.544 --> 38:59.409
Let me go first, okay?

39:02.049 --> 39:04.916
I screwed up. Hugely.

39:06.887 --> 39:09.674
And giving your gun to a psychopath,

39:11.517 --> 39:14.509
that may have been the least of my mistakes.

39:16.104 --> 39:17.890
I lost your trust.

39:21.026 --> 39:23.233
I thought I could handle my affliction.

39:23.445 --> 39:25.527
-Chris, you...
-Last night,

39:25.948 --> 39:27.688
I gave into it,

39:28.700 --> 39:31.032
and nearly got people killed.

39:32.579 --> 39:36.743
And that thing I said to you
about wishing you weren't immune,

39:37.793 --> 39:38.908
that's not true.

39:41.088 --> 39:42.373
I wanna be with you, Audrey.

39:42.464 --> 39:44.796
I need to be with you.

39:51.473 --> 39:52.974
You once told me,

39:54.017 --> 39:57.100
"I want you because you're you."

39:59.940 --> 40:03.603
Wanting me and needing me,
they're two different things.

40:06.363 --> 40:09.821
I can't be the person that keeps you you.

40:14.121 --> 40:16.487
You gotta do that on your own.

40:17.332 --> 40:18.492
Yeah.

40:21.169 --> 40:24.957
It's just you'd eventually
start resenting me for it.

40:28.135 --> 40:31.218
I think the best thing for me to do
is to just go

40:32.347 --> 40:34.724
somewhere by myself,
away from other people.

40:34.850 --> 40:36.431
No, Chris, that's not what I'm saying.

40:36.518 --> 40:38.304
You know, someday
The Troubles are gonna end,

40:39.021 --> 40:42.513
and I'm gonna go back
to being the guy that everybody hates.

40:46.737 --> 40:49.695
Maybe then I'll be a guy that you can love.
