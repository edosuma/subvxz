WEBVTT

00:00.051 --> 00:01.484
What are you doing?

00:02.220 --> 00:03.585
You locked us in the vault.

00:03.654 --> 00:06.054
I'll bet anything that he met
some gorgeous clerk at the bank...

00:06.123 --> 00:07.488
and he took off with her
for the weekend.

00:07.558 --> 00:09.583
We're gonna run out of air?
Help!

00:10.862 --> 00:12.022
Paradise Pizza?

00:12.096 --> 00:14.530
<i>We ordered large zombies,
everything but anchovies.</i>

00:14.599 --> 00:18.467
What would you say
to dinner for two with wine?

00:19.804 --> 00:23.900
You can really tell when you
might be compatible with somebody...

00:23.975 --> 00:25.875
by the way you dance together.

00:26.277 --> 00:27.403
Can you turn it?

00:27.478 --> 00:29.469
Think I'm up here for my health?

02:20.191 --> 02:21.954
This is nice. Very nice.

02:27.331 --> 02:30.767
By this time Monday,
you and I are going to be very rich men.

02:32.803 --> 02:34.031
<i>Expectations.</i>

02:34.105 --> 02:37.336
<i>I've been giving a lot of
thought lately to expectations.</i>

02:37.408 --> 02:40.639
<i>Seems like everybody comes to
paradise with a whole stack of them.</i>

02:40.711 --> 02:42.110
<i>Take Sherwood Conners.</i>

02:42.179 --> 02:46.047
<i>He thought owning a hotel on every
island in the chain would make him happy.</i>

02:46.117 --> 02:47.709
<i>And he was right. It did.</i>

02:47.785 --> 02:50.049
<i>Along the way, I'd done
some work for Conners...</i>

02:50.121 --> 02:53.181
<i>and by way of thanks,
he sent me a weekend pass for three...</i>

02:53.257 --> 02:55.623
<i>at his luxury resort
on the Big Island...</i>

02:55.693 --> 02:57.160
<i>and something else.</i>

02:57.228 --> 03:00.322
<i>A rare antique statue
of an aumakua.</i>

03:00.398 --> 03:03.424
<i>Kind of a Hawaiian guardian angel,
according to Higgins.</i>

03:11.776 --> 03:12.800
Higgins.

03:12.877 --> 03:14.037
Magnum.

03:14.111 --> 03:16.079
There you are. I've been
looking all over for you.

03:16.147 --> 03:18.240
Higgins, what are you doing?

03:18.416 --> 03:20.213
Nothing. I've brought you
a client.

03:20.284 --> 03:22.115
Susan Johnson, Thomas Magnum.

03:22.386 --> 03:23.478
Hello.

03:23.721 --> 03:24.779
Hi.

03:26.123 --> 03:28.648
I distinctly heard you
chanting, Higgins.

03:28.926 --> 03:32.020
A good luck chant for Miss
Johnson seemed only appropriate.

03:32.096 --> 03:33.791
I've already given her
fair warning...

03:33.864 --> 03:37.197
that she would probably do better to
inquire elsewhere for an investigator.

03:37.268 --> 03:38.633
But I wouldn't hear of it.

03:38.702 --> 03:40.533
But she wouldn't hear of it.

03:40.838 --> 03:43.306
That's very nice, but...
Then it's settled.

03:43.774 --> 03:45.366
Could you start today?

03:46.043 --> 03:47.840
No. I don't know. Well, what...

03:47.912 --> 03:49.846
Magnum, Miss Johnson
is the assistant manager...

03:49.914 --> 03:51.905
of the First
Anglo-Hawaiian Bank...

03:51.982 --> 03:55.008
which handles all of Mr. Masters'
transactions on the island.

03:55.086 --> 03:56.576
And though I've tried
to discourage her...

03:56.654 --> 03:59.248
she seems determined to
talk to you about her case.

03:59.323 --> 04:02.986
I would think you could find a
moment or two to discuss it with her.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.525
Well, sure.

04:05.362 --> 04:07.296
We could discuss it.
You could?

04:07.565 --> 04:10.295
Oh, thank you.
It means an awful lot to me. l...

04:10.367 --> 04:13.063
Thank you so much,
Mr. Higgins. Thank you.

04:13.137 --> 04:15.230
I only hope
you'll thank me later.

04:19.209 --> 04:20.939
I sure do appreciate this.

04:21.144 --> 04:22.407
It's all right.

04:23.781 --> 04:25.749
I'm just gonna change
my clothes, okay?

04:25.816 --> 04:26.976
Oh.

04:27.051 --> 04:28.075
Sure.

04:28.419 --> 04:31.786
I can't tell you how thrilled I
am that you're taking my case.

04:31.922 --> 04:33.514
I'll just be a minute.

04:34.024 --> 04:37.357
I want you to know that I intend
to pay you your regular rate.

04:37.428 --> 04:39.692
You get the best,
you pay for it. I know that.

04:39.763 --> 04:41.924
I'm sure we
can work something out.

04:41.999 --> 04:43.432
Oh, no, I insist.

04:43.501 --> 04:46.959
I insist on paying you your full fare.
I insist on that.

04:47.104 --> 04:48.196
Okay.

04:48.772 --> 04:50.603
No matter how long it takes.

04:55.880 --> 04:58.906
Anyway, there's somebody I'd
like you to follow for me.

04:59.016 --> 05:00.483
I have his picture right...

05:01.719 --> 05:02.879
Oh!

05:03.120 --> 05:05.020
I'm so sorry.

05:05.523 --> 05:07.787
Your guardian angel. Oh!

05:08.092 --> 05:09.787
I am so sorry.

05:09.860 --> 05:14.559
Oh, no. It's all right.
It's nothing really. It was very old.

05:16.233 --> 05:17.757
I knew it. I knew it.

05:17.868 --> 05:20.860
I knew it was gonna happen.
I haven't broken anything in 12 years...

05:20.938 --> 05:23.031
and then he's back in town
and look what happens.

05:23.107 --> 05:26.133
Careful, you're gonna cut yourself.
Who's back in town?

05:26.844 --> 05:28.436
Can you keep a secret?

05:28.979 --> 05:32.210
Sure, that's part of the deal.
Client confidentiality.

05:33.384 --> 05:36.182
My father just got out
of the penitentiary.

05:37.354 --> 05:40.812
He was paroled two weeks ago and
he shows up on my doorstep...

05:40.891 --> 05:42.222
the very next day.

05:42.293 --> 05:44.318
Ow! Now, see. I knew it.
Let me look at that.

05:44.395 --> 05:47.125
No, it's all right.
Really, it's... It's bleeding.

05:47.364 --> 05:48.854
Ooh.
Ooh.

05:49.333 --> 05:50.493
Come here.

05:50.634 --> 05:51.760
Here. Let me...

05:51.835 --> 05:53.962
Just come over to the couch here,
and I'll...

05:54.038 --> 05:56.029
take care of that.
It'll drip.

05:56.106 --> 05:58.040
No, it won't.
Just relax, okay?

06:01.946 --> 06:03.937
All my life,
it's been like this.

06:04.014 --> 06:05.948
Everything's going along
just great...

06:06.016 --> 06:08.985
and then all of a sudden
it's like I've got this...

06:09.220 --> 06:12.747
built-in early warning
system, you know. l...

06:13.123 --> 06:15.148
I start... This might sting a little bit.

06:15.226 --> 06:18.559
I start breaking things,
I start walking into things...

06:18.629 --> 06:20.392
I start losing things.

06:20.464 --> 06:23.194
And then sure enough,
he's planning a big caper.

06:24.802 --> 06:26.702
You don't believe me, do you?

06:27.938 --> 06:30.133
I don't see how you can
prove something like that.

06:30.207 --> 06:32.801
Here. This might stop the bleeding.
Proof?

06:33.010 --> 06:34.534
Proof? You want proof?

06:34.612 --> 06:37.513
I'll give you proof.
I'll show you proof. Look...

06:37.581 --> 06:40.379
Look at the...
Look at this watch. Sorry.

06:40.451 --> 06:43.852
Just look at this watch.
Look at that. He bought this for me.

06:43.921 --> 06:48.017
Now that's not a cheap watch. It tells
the time in four different time zones.

06:49.660 --> 06:52.458
Look at this.
Look at all of this.

06:52.529 --> 06:54.622
Now, it's a radio.

06:55.232 --> 06:58.326
Expensive little radio.
And this knife.

06:59.470 --> 07:02.030
It's got everything in it,
including a hacksaw.

07:02.106 --> 07:06.099
This is a Backpacker's Pal for
survival in the wilderness.

07:06.176 --> 07:08.269
Ever since he's been here,
he's just...

07:08.345 --> 07:11.371
been buying me one outlandish
gift after the other.

07:11.448 --> 07:14.246
Well, generosity
isn't exactly a crime.

07:16.153 --> 07:18.678
Where would a man who just
got out of the penitentiary...

07:18.756 --> 07:20.781
get the money
for these kinds of gifts?

07:22.960 --> 07:24.188
I don't know.

07:24.428 --> 07:25.793
I don't, either.

07:26.330 --> 07:28.662
Unless he's doing
something illegal.

07:30.934 --> 07:32.458
So, anyway...

07:33.103 --> 07:35.697
I was hoping...
l thought maybe that...

07:36.307 --> 07:37.968
you could follow him around...

07:38.042 --> 07:42.035
and then if you saw him starting to
commit a crime then you could stop him.

07:45.015 --> 07:47.745
I don't think I could just
follow someone around...

07:47.818 --> 07:50.252
waiting to see if he was
going to commit a crime.

07:50.321 --> 07:51.549
You couldn't?

07:51.689 --> 07:52.815
No.

07:53.657 --> 07:56.057
Jonathan,
I have the fruit juice.

07:56.193 --> 07:57.251
Hmm?

07:57.328 --> 08:01.788
I think you're going to be quite pleased
with it this year, if I do say so myself.

08:02.333 --> 08:05.234
It has a refreshingly
tart quality.

08:07.571 --> 08:09.004
Is something wrong?

08:09.073 --> 08:10.131
What?

08:10.841 --> 08:12.570
No, I seem to have misplaced...

08:12.643 --> 08:15.806
<i>Infinite Consciousness.</i>

08:15.979 --> 08:18.470
I must find it.
I read from it every year.

08:18.949 --> 08:20.473
It is inspiring.

08:20.551 --> 08:22.348
Do you realize
how valuable that book is?

08:22.419 --> 08:24.387
It had been given to me
by the Maharishi himself.

08:24.455 --> 08:26.116
I'm certain it will turn up.

08:26.190 --> 08:29.751
Can't have a meditation weekend
without the inspirational readings.

08:29.827 --> 08:31.454
I don't know, Jonathan.

08:31.662 --> 08:34.222
Perhaps we should try something
different this year...

08:34.298 --> 08:36.698
and share our own
inspirational thoughts...

08:36.767 --> 08:39.065
instead of listening
to someone else's.

08:39.436 --> 08:42.701
Who knows what might come out
of an atmosphere of intimacy.

08:42.873 --> 08:44.500
The safety deposit box.

08:45.843 --> 08:47.242
I beg your pardon.

08:47.644 --> 08:50.636
I put it in my safety
deposit box for safekeeping.

08:50.914 --> 08:53.007
The storage company is due
to arrive at any moment...

08:53.083 --> 08:55.074
with the rice mats
and lotus pillows.

08:55.152 --> 08:57.484
I don't have time now
to go to the bank.

08:57.554 --> 08:59.988
Perhaps Magnum could
pick it up for me.

09:01.892 --> 09:04.383
I wanted to spend the
weekend with just Gloria.

09:04.461 --> 09:05.519
Hi, guys.

09:05.596 --> 09:09.225
Then she drops the bomb on me and tells
me that her cousin is flying in, too.

09:09.299 --> 09:10.994
Feast your eyes on this.

09:11.068 --> 09:12.695
Not now, Thomas.
T.C.'s got a big problem.

09:12.770 --> 09:14.101
So, what's wrong
with her cousin?

09:14.171 --> 09:16.435
Today is the day
I pay you back...

09:16.507 --> 09:18.304
for all the favors
that you've done for me.

09:18.375 --> 09:21.572
Nothing. Except that every time
her cousin, Elena comes in town...

09:21.645 --> 09:23.545
Gloria and I end up fighting.

09:23.614 --> 09:26.105
You're going to have
the weekend of your lives.

09:26.183 --> 09:28.913
Look, I got a
real good solution for your problem.

09:28.986 --> 09:30.647
Just tell Gloria you don't
wanna see her cousin.

09:30.721 --> 09:33.212
Are you kidding?
She's got the whole weekend planned.

09:33.290 --> 09:34.518
Private beach cottage.

09:34.591 --> 09:38.118
First she got me signed up for some
dumb two-hour tour of a muumuu factory.

09:38.195 --> 09:40.755
Free 24-hour room service.

09:40.831 --> 09:43.493
Then, I gotta
drive them all the way to Waialua...

09:43.567 --> 09:45.296
for noontime hula lessons.

09:45.569 --> 09:46.797
You and hula?

09:46.870 --> 09:49.498
An all-expense paid
weekend for three...

09:49.573 --> 09:51.404
at the Mala Pua Resort Hotel...

09:51.475 --> 09:53.466
compliments of Sherwood Conners.

09:54.411 --> 09:55.776
Let me see that.

09:56.480 --> 10:00.007
The one time you actually pay off
a debt, I have to have other plans.

10:00.083 --> 10:02.051
Wait a minute, T.C.
Don't you see?

10:02.119 --> 10:04.053
This is the answer
to your problem with Gloria.

10:04.121 --> 10:06.248
Just tell her you have to
go away this weekend.

10:06.323 --> 10:09.087
Oh, no. I couldn't do that.

10:14.798 --> 10:16.288
8:00?
8:00.

10:16.366 --> 10:18.960
Hey, wait a minute.
Thomas! Higgins called.

10:19.036 --> 10:21.095
He needs you to go to the
bank to pick up some book...

10:21.171 --> 10:22.832
from the safety deposit box.
Here's the name.

10:22.906 --> 10:24.430
Bank? Tell him
you didn't see me.

10:24.508 --> 10:25.566
He said it's urgent.

10:25.642 --> 10:27.667
I'm not going.
No way. Forget it.

10:30.914 --> 10:33.610
This is part of
our new security system.

10:33.884 --> 10:36.148
It's Mr. Campbell's idea.
Ah.

10:38.455 --> 10:40.286
Oh, here.
That's quite heavy.

10:41.058 --> 10:43.322
Right. Now I have to open
the fire door.

10:43.594 --> 10:44.583
Oh.

10:44.728 --> 10:45.786
I can't believe it.

10:45.863 --> 10:49.959
If I hadn't gone to change after closing
up, we would have missed each other.

10:50.100 --> 10:52.830
You know something? All the way
back to work this afternoon...

10:52.903 --> 10:55.599
I was hoping you'd change your
mind about taking my case.

10:55.672 --> 10:57.731
Well, I haven't changed my mind.

10:57.808 --> 11:00.606
And here you are.
I'm here for the book.

11:01.011 --> 11:03.571
Yes, I know you're here
for the book, but...

11:06.917 --> 11:08.544
Do you believe in fate?

11:09.386 --> 11:13.948
You mean the "I wouldn't be here if I wasn't
destined to take your case" kind of fate?

11:14.491 --> 11:15.583
Yeah.

11:15.659 --> 11:16.819
No.

11:17.561 --> 11:19.119
There we go. Thank you.

11:19.196 --> 11:21.027
You're welcome.
Where are you going?

11:21.098 --> 11:24.397
I have to deliver the book
and catch a plane.

11:24.801 --> 11:25.961
Wait!

11:27.304 --> 11:29.465
What are you doing?

11:29.540 --> 11:32.737
There's something I didn't tell
you this morning when I saw you.

11:32.809 --> 11:34.970
You locked us in the vault.
It's about this weekend.

11:35.045 --> 11:37.309
You locked us in the vault.
This morning...

11:37.381 --> 11:41.078
my father told me that he had a big
surprise planned for me, Monday.

11:41.151 --> 11:42.675
So?
Don't you get it?

11:42.753 --> 11:46.314
I mean, whatever he's cooking up,
it's gonna happen this weekend.

11:47.424 --> 11:49.358
Well, whatever it is,
we're going to miss it...

11:49.426 --> 11:51.257
because you locked us
in the vault!

11:51.328 --> 11:53.353
I didn't lock us in the vault!

11:53.430 --> 11:56.593
Well, I did. I did lock us in the vault
but I can get us out of the vault.

11:56.667 --> 11:58.931
I just wanted to explain
to you about my father.

11:59.002 --> 12:00.560
Miss Johnson.
Susan.

12:00.637 --> 12:04.471
Susan, a big surprise could
be a trip to Sea Life Park.

12:04.541 --> 12:07.601
A big surprise could be two
tickets to the Don Ho show.

12:08.745 --> 12:10.474
You think I'm overreacting.

12:10.547 --> 12:11.844
Yes, I do.

12:13.584 --> 12:15.108
All right, I'm sorry.

12:15.419 --> 12:17.546
I'll get us out of here
in a jiffy.

12:17.754 --> 12:18.812
Thank you.

12:20.424 --> 12:22.619
I just have to punch in
the code...

12:23.327 --> 12:25.022
and the door will open.

12:25.095 --> 12:26.119
Good.

12:37.874 --> 12:40.399
I think I locked us
in the vault.

12:47.983 --> 12:51.009
The important thing is
that we should both remain calm.

12:51.086 --> 12:52.212
Calm?

12:52.654 --> 12:56.090
Calm? I have three airline
tickets for a plane...

12:56.158 --> 12:58.217
that I'm gonna miss
in three hours!

12:58.293 --> 12:59.954
Look, why don't you just
use your head?

13:00.029 --> 13:02.793
After all, somebody is bound to
notice that we haven't come back.

13:02.865 --> 13:05.163
I mean, do you think that
we're the last two people...

13:05.234 --> 13:07.498
who are gonna use this vault
this afternoon?

13:07.569 --> 13:09.161
You're asking me?

13:09.238 --> 13:11.570
How would I know?
It's possible!

13:11.640 --> 13:13.540
All right, then,
I'll use the backup system.

13:13.609 --> 13:15.338
Backup system.
You have a backup system?

13:15.411 --> 13:16.639
Yes.
Use it!

13:16.712 --> 13:17.906
Well, then, be calm.

13:17.980 --> 13:19.311
I'm calm!

13:19.381 --> 13:21.008
Hold this.
I'm calm.

13:25.554 --> 13:26.851
I'm calm.

13:29.892 --> 13:32.417
Help!

13:32.494 --> 13:34.689
Help!

13:35.097 --> 13:37.395
Help!

13:37.666 --> 13:39.896
The bank closed
nearly two hours ago.

13:39.968 --> 13:42.801
My guests are already arriving for
our annual meditation weekend...

13:42.871 --> 13:45.669
and still no Magnum
and no book. Typical.

13:46.041 --> 13:49.408
Meditation weekend? You're just gonna
sit around all weekend and think?

13:49.478 --> 13:50.740
And fast.

13:50.913 --> 13:53.473
And contemplate
man's nobler aspirations...

13:53.582 --> 13:55.140
peace, serenity...

13:55.217 --> 13:56.912
Jonathan!

13:56.985 --> 13:58.077
Come quickly.

13:58.153 --> 13:59.142
What is it, Agatha?

13:59.221 --> 14:02.418
There's some disagreement over
the placing of the rice mats.

14:02.491 --> 14:04.891
I explained it very carefully...

14:04.960 --> 14:07.360
but you know how pushy
Millie can be.

14:07.563 --> 14:10.157
She and Winston
almost came to blows.

14:10.265 --> 14:11.994
Very well, I'm on my way.

14:12.568 --> 14:16.504
When Magnum arrives, please inform
him that I need that book immediately.

14:19.241 --> 14:20.708
I'm an hour late for my dinner.

14:20.776 --> 14:21.936
I gotta get out of here!

14:22.010 --> 14:23.500
Will you calm down? Please.

14:23.579 --> 14:25.638
Calm down. Oh, come on.
Can't you help me?

14:25.714 --> 14:27.113
I'm trying. Calm down.

14:27.182 --> 14:29.480
What have you ever done in a
situation like this before?

14:29.551 --> 14:31.314
I hate to disillusion you,
Susan...

14:31.386 --> 14:35.220
but no one's ever locked me into
a bank vault before. Oh, please.

14:35.290 --> 14:38.453
You're a private detective.
You've been in spots like this before.

14:38.527 --> 14:41.155
Don't you have anything on you,
you could get us out of here with?

14:41.230 --> 14:42.788
Don't you have a hacksaw?

14:42.865 --> 14:45.095
No. And I don't have
a two-way wrist radio.

14:45.167 --> 14:47.533
And I don't have
a telephone in my shoe.

14:49.638 --> 14:53.597
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

14:54.710 --> 14:58.077
Knife. This knife my father gave me,
it's got a million tools in it.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.138
There's got to be something
in there you could use.

15:00.215 --> 15:02.308
I doubt if it has
a hacksaw in it.

15:06.622 --> 15:09.250
You know, you're not aware of this,
but tonight is probably...

15:09.324 --> 15:11.815
the most important night
of my entire life.

15:12.427 --> 15:14.691
Bill, Mr. Campbell,
our manager...

15:15.697 --> 15:18.791
Well, I'm pretty sure,
I'm almost pretty sure...

15:18.934 --> 15:21.129
98% sure that tonight...

15:22.137 --> 15:24.196
Oh, never mind. You don't
want to hear all this.

15:24.273 --> 15:26.173
No, no, no, Bill, the manager...

15:27.142 --> 15:29.542
I thought maybe
tonight he'd propose...

15:30.512 --> 15:31.604
to me.

15:31.680 --> 15:32.738
Oh.

15:33.882 --> 15:35.509
Well, I think that's terrific.

15:35.584 --> 15:37.176
If we get out of here.

15:37.553 --> 15:40.989
So, now you can understand why
I might be a little bit upset.

15:41.390 --> 15:44.018
Well, I mean, I kind of knew
it had to be more than...

15:44.092 --> 15:46.390
being locked up in a small
room without any food or water.

15:46.461 --> 15:47.655
Or air.
Or air?

15:47.729 --> 15:48.753
We're gonna run out of air?

15:48.830 --> 15:51.264
We're not gonna run out
of air. We have air.

15:51.333 --> 15:53.062
This ventilator...

15:54.069 --> 15:55.559
Which isn't working.

15:56.672 --> 16:00.938
But it would take a long time to
run completely out, wouldn't it?

16:05.914 --> 16:07.381
What are you doing?

16:09.418 --> 16:11.318
You look like you have an idea.

16:11.386 --> 16:13.286
Maybe...
What?

16:13.355 --> 16:15.619
I can bypass the short.

16:16.525 --> 16:17.685
Brilliant.

16:22.331 --> 16:23.798
What pretty colors.

16:26.902 --> 16:28.267
Wait a minute.
What?

16:28.337 --> 16:30.100
Look at this, right here.
See these two wires.

16:30.172 --> 16:31.196
Yeah.

16:31.273 --> 16:34.299
They're fused together.
That has got to be the problem.

16:34.443 --> 16:37.139
I'll just bypass this.

16:38.046 --> 16:39.206
Be careful.

16:41.883 --> 16:43.009
And then...

16:43.719 --> 16:45.687
take this wire here...

16:46.822 --> 16:48.414
and that should do it.

16:48.523 --> 16:51.822
Well, now, that's incredible.
Where did you learn to do that?

16:53.128 --> 16:54.288
Want to try it?
Yeah.

16:54.363 --> 16:55.455
All right.

17:15.717 --> 17:17.207
How can he do this to us?

17:17.286 --> 17:19.777
I'll bet anything that he met
some gorgeous clerk at the bank...

17:19.855 --> 17:21.720
and he took off with her
for the weekend.

17:23.291 --> 17:24.554
What are you doing?

17:24.626 --> 17:27.753
Calling Gloria to tell her
that my trip's been canceled.

17:28.497 --> 17:30.692
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

17:31.400 --> 17:34.233
Thomas promised a weekend of fun
and sun. We got it right here.

17:34.303 --> 17:37.431
We got the tidal pool, the tennis
courts, and one terrific party room.

17:37.506 --> 17:40.134
What are you talking about?
I'll tell you what I'm talking about.

17:40.208 --> 17:42.403
We're gonna invite some people,
we're gonna go to the club...

17:42.477 --> 17:44.536
we're gonna get some food and
we're gonna get some drink...

17:44.613 --> 17:46.604
and we're gonna charge it to
Robin Masters per Thomas Magnum.

17:46.682 --> 17:48.411
Come on, what do you say?

17:49.384 --> 17:51.045
Okay, hurry up.
Okay, here we go.

17:51.119 --> 17:53.178
Put your foot right there.
Be careful.

17:53.255 --> 17:54.313
You ready?
One...

17:54.389 --> 17:55.617
One, two...

17:55.691 --> 17:57.556
three.

17:57.626 --> 17:59.287
Hold me...
l got you.

17:59.361 --> 18:01.795
I got it, I got it.
I got it.

18:01.930 --> 18:04.262
Wait a minute. I can't see.
I can't see.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.927
A little...
A little forward.

18:07.002 --> 18:08.697
I can't...
Go forward, forward.

18:08.837 --> 18:10.429
Stop now. A little bit...

18:10.505 --> 18:12.837
to the right. I've got it.
I've got it! You got it?

18:12.908 --> 18:14.466
Can you turn it?
Got it!

18:14.543 --> 18:16.033
Can you turn it?

18:16.111 --> 18:17.305
No.

18:18.380 --> 18:19.574
You got to try!

18:19.648 --> 18:21.138
I am trying.

18:22.217 --> 18:24.185
Think I'm up here for my health?

18:24.252 --> 18:26.652
I can't breathe.
Put me down.

18:26.722 --> 18:27.916
That hurts.

18:27.989 --> 18:29.081
Put me down.
Okay.

18:29.157 --> 18:30.590
Wait. There.

18:30.659 --> 18:31.956
Oh, God. No.

18:32.027 --> 18:33.995
Okay.
Good. Let it go.

18:34.329 --> 18:36.422
There.

18:42.404 --> 18:43.666
Wait a minute.

18:59.921 --> 19:01.320
Thank you.

19:01.857 --> 19:03.188
You're welcome.

19:05.093 --> 19:06.321
I'm sorry.

19:07.195 --> 19:09.493
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

19:10.265 --> 19:11.892
that I got you all wet.

19:12.267 --> 19:13.666
That's okay.

19:14.569 --> 19:16.298
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

19:17.172 --> 19:19.333
I'm sorry I locked us in here.

19:22.778 --> 19:24.109
Back to you.

19:24.179 --> 19:25.476
I've run out.

19:28.517 --> 19:30.075
Would you like a towel?

19:30.152 --> 19:32.950
I think I have one
in my Backpacker's Pal.

19:33.355 --> 19:34.617
No, thank you.

19:36.591 --> 19:37.956
Well, I want one.

19:41.096 --> 19:44.588
You know, I don't know
about you, but...

19:45.834 --> 19:49.634
these walls are beginning to close
on to me, being locked up like this.

19:53.175 --> 19:54.369
Where does this go?

19:54.443 --> 19:57.742
You can't get in there. It's locked.
It's the bank's deposit.

19:58.346 --> 20:00.644
Well, who in the world
left that open?

20:00.715 --> 20:01.909
Bill's gonna be furious.

20:01.983 --> 20:04.747
He spends all this money on
modern security equipment...

20:04.820 --> 20:06.947
and somebody leaves
the doors open.

20:13.895 --> 20:15.021
Wow.

20:20.769 --> 20:21.827
What?

20:21.903 --> 20:23.029
It's funny.

20:23.104 --> 20:24.162
What?

20:24.239 --> 20:25.934
I mean, when you
put it all together...

20:26.007 --> 20:27.736
it doesn't even look real.

20:30.078 --> 20:31.238
No.

20:32.714 --> 20:34.079
No, he wouldn't.

20:34.649 --> 20:37.413
He wouldn't. Not my bank.

20:37.719 --> 20:38.845
No.

20:39.287 --> 20:41.881
What are you talking about?
Oh, no!

20:42.057 --> 20:44.082
Look, the flag on top
of the White House...

20:44.159 --> 20:45.683
it's not quite right.

20:45.760 --> 20:46.954
The flag?

20:47.362 --> 20:49.830
"Big surprise
for this weekend," he said.

20:50.832 --> 20:52.459
Yeah, well, he's right.

20:52.868 --> 20:55.632
This, Mr. Magnum,
is my father's handiwork.

20:55.704 --> 20:57.296
It's counterfeit, all of it.

20:57.372 --> 20:58.669
What?
Mmm-hmm.

21:00.942 --> 21:02.967
Wait a minute. If this
really is counterfeit...

21:03.044 --> 21:04.102
Oh, it is.

21:04.179 --> 21:06.647
What makes you think
your father's involved?

21:06.715 --> 21:08.205
He's Herbert Norton.

21:08.884 --> 21:12.217
Paris, Montreal, Atlantic City.

21:13.421 --> 21:16.151
Herbie "Rembrandt" Norton?
Rembrandt.

21:16.491 --> 21:20.894
Probably the most famous
engraver in the entire world.

21:21.429 --> 21:23.920
Federal reserve notes
being his specialty...

21:23.999 --> 21:26.627
and he's using my bank
to make the switch.

21:27.102 --> 21:29.036
My bank!

21:37.544 --> 21:40.604
This is one scrape I'm
not gonna bail my father out of.

21:40.680 --> 21:43.740
He got himself into it,
he can get himself out.

21:47.420 --> 21:49.149
How do you think he did it?

21:49.389 --> 21:52.722
I only hope I can keep my job once
Mr. Halliburton comes in here...

21:52.792 --> 21:56.956
and finds me locked up with
$2,000,000 worth of Herb-money.

21:57.164 --> 21:58.290
Who's Halliburton?

21:58.365 --> 21:59.957
The bank president.

22:00.534 --> 22:02.229
Does he have access
to the vault?

22:02.302 --> 22:03.462
No.

22:04.004 --> 22:05.266
Of course, he has.

22:05.338 --> 22:06.498
Who else?

22:06.573 --> 22:08.234
Well, I do, and Bill.

22:09.075 --> 22:10.337
Oh, God. Bill.

22:10.443 --> 22:12.741
What is he gonna say
when he finds out?

22:13.013 --> 22:16.141
Anybody else? You know,
a head teller, anybody like that?

22:17.150 --> 22:18.947
What are you talking about?

22:19.853 --> 22:21.946
Let's think about this
logically.

22:23.190 --> 22:24.487
If Herb...

22:25.158 --> 22:27.649
if Herb made the switch...

22:28.428 --> 22:32.125
then he had to get
the fake money in...

22:32.566 --> 22:35.558
and the real money out.
Now, there's a lot of money in here.

22:35.635 --> 22:39.071
That means it had to be done
over a period of time...

22:39.472 --> 22:42.407
and it had to be done
by someone on the inside.

22:42.475 --> 22:46.036
So, you start with
who had access to the vault.

22:47.180 --> 22:49.648
You're telling me
you're working on the case?

22:49.716 --> 22:51.650
That's what you hired me to do.

22:52.485 --> 22:53.850
You turned me down.

22:53.920 --> 22:55.182
Yeah, but...

22:55.922 --> 22:57.856
I didn't know your father
was Rembrandt Norton.

22:57.924 --> 22:59.016
Mmm-hmm.

22:59.092 --> 23:02.323
I see. Rembrandt Norton is more
important to you than I am.

23:02.395 --> 23:05.728
Well, I got news for you,
Mr. Magnum. You're off the case.

23:05.799 --> 23:08.097
Wait a minute.
You're fired!

23:08.268 --> 23:10.463
What'd I say? What's wrong?

23:11.204 --> 23:12.933
I'm about to lose my job...

23:13.006 --> 23:15.770
I've lost my fiancé,
my almost fiancé...

23:15.842 --> 23:17.867
and I'm probably gonna
lose my life in here...

23:17.944 --> 23:19.809
and all you care about
is this stinking case.

23:19.879 --> 23:20.937
No.

23:21.014 --> 23:22.948
Well, not entirely.

23:23.016 --> 23:25.109
But, gee, I mean...

23:25.785 --> 23:27.946
how many times do you get
a chance to match wits...

23:28.021 --> 23:30.251
with a criminal mind like
Herbie "Rembrandt" Norton's?

23:30.323 --> 23:32.257
Speaking of wits,
why don't you dredge up...

23:32.325 --> 23:35.351
the little bit you've got left
and get us out of here?

23:36.730 --> 23:38.391
All right, I will.

23:38.465 --> 23:39.557
Good.

23:40.233 --> 23:41.427
I promise.

23:46.940 --> 23:48.669
The head teller.
What?

23:48.908 --> 23:50.899
That's what...
The head teller.

23:51.378 --> 23:53.710
That's what he did,
he romanced the head teller...

23:53.780 --> 23:57.409
and he gave her a big song and dance
about Argentina and a lot of money.

23:57.484 --> 24:00.510
Yeah? There is
one other possibility.

24:00.587 --> 24:01.713
What?

24:01.788 --> 24:02.846
You.

24:02.922 --> 24:04.184
Me?

24:10.030 --> 24:11.588
I didn't really mean it.
I mean...

24:11.665 --> 24:14.930
but a good investigator
never overlooks the obvious.

24:15.001 --> 24:17.561
I didn't really think that.
You want to try this thing?

24:17.637 --> 24:18.899
Did you fix it?

24:20.907 --> 24:22.841
I don't know,
you wanna punch it?

24:22.909 --> 24:24.501
Don't tempt me.

24:29.382 --> 24:31.475
I mean, there's only
so many combinations.

24:31.551 --> 24:33.348
This might be the right one.

24:39.859 --> 24:40.951
Of course...

24:41.027 --> 24:43.495
that would probably be
expecting too much.

25:07.721 --> 25:09.882
Everyone's ready, Jonathan.

25:13.193 --> 25:17.152
I'd like to take a moment to prepare
myself spiritually for the readings.

25:17.797 --> 25:18.923
Certainly.

25:40.220 --> 25:42.381
Did you get a hold of Gloria?
Huh?

25:42.622 --> 25:44.283
Did you get a hold of Gloria?

25:44.357 --> 25:46.757
Still no answer.
I wonder where she could be.

25:46.826 --> 25:47.884
I don't know.

25:47.961 --> 25:49.952
But she's missing a great party.

26:00.673 --> 26:02.140
Paradise Pizza?

26:02.208 --> 26:03.436
I beg your pardon.

26:03.510 --> 26:04.977
Paradise Pizza.

26:05.044 --> 26:08.343
We ordered large zombies,
everything but anchovies.

26:08.415 --> 26:10.883
Who are you and
what are you doing here?

26:10.950 --> 26:14.010
Oh, hi, Higgins. I hope
we're not disturbing you.

26:14.087 --> 26:16.055
Disturbing me?

26:16.122 --> 26:20.024
I have an entire weekend of quiet
meditation and fasting planned...

26:20.093 --> 26:22.493
and just as we begin
our moonlight chanting...

26:22.562 --> 26:26.999
the cacophonous sounds of that hi-fi
come blasting across the grounds.

26:27.066 --> 26:30.467
I come over here to find that not only
has Magnum not returned with my book...

26:30.537 --> 26:33.062
but the two of you have turned
Mr. Masters' guest quarters...

26:33.139 --> 26:35.403
into some kind of
musical rumpus room.

26:35.475 --> 26:38.467
Why on earth would that
disturb me?

26:39.579 --> 26:41.706
You're not from Paradise Pizza.

26:46.653 --> 26:49.417
I demand to know
what you're doing here.

26:49.856 --> 26:51.153
Jonathan?

26:51.224 --> 26:53.988
Jonathan! Jonathan!

26:54.060 --> 26:56.255
Just a moment, Agatha.
I'm waiting.

26:56.563 --> 26:58.292
Jonathan, I wouldn't
disturb you, but...

26:58.364 --> 26:59.490
What is it, Agatha?

26:59.566 --> 27:03.400
Something has gone terribly
wrong. It's the fruit juice.

27:03.470 --> 27:05.870
I don't know if it was
out in the sun too long...

27:05.939 --> 27:07.804
or if it fermented
in the bottles.

27:07.874 --> 27:11.366
People are behaving
in the most outlandish manner.

27:11.444 --> 27:14.504
Millie and Winston are using
their lotus pillows to...

27:14.881 --> 27:17.679
Well, it's just shocking.

27:22.422 --> 27:25.152
What has happened
to my serene weekend?

27:28.061 --> 27:31.087
I shall be back and I shall
expect a full explanation.

27:36.402 --> 27:40.498
You should know better than to associate
with this riff-raff. You're British.

27:46.746 --> 27:47.770
You're on your own, Ace.

27:47.847 --> 27:49.280
Wait a minute.
Where're you going?

27:49.349 --> 27:50.976
I'm going to find Gloria.

27:51.050 --> 27:53.883
If I hadn't lied to her in the first
place, we could be together now...

27:53.953 --> 27:56.854
instead of giving excuses to
Higgins and her about some dumb...

27:56.923 --> 27:58.550
T.C.?
What?

27:59.092 --> 28:00.457
Gloria?

28:00.527 --> 28:02.222
What are you doing here?

28:02.295 --> 28:04.820
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

28:04.898 --> 28:07.526
Don't try and turn
this around, Theodore Calvin.

28:07.600 --> 28:10.068
You were supposed to
go to the Big lsland.

28:10.637 --> 28:12.298
Yeah, right.

28:12.839 --> 28:15.364
Well, I'll explain it all
to you on the way.

28:15.441 --> 28:16.635
On the way where?

28:16.709 --> 28:18.301
I am taking you home.

28:18.378 --> 28:20.209
Oh, no, you're not.

28:20.880 --> 28:23.974
I was invited to a party.
You had other plans.

28:24.050 --> 28:26.416
I am staying at this party.

28:27.754 --> 28:29.153
Yeah, well, so am l.

28:29.222 --> 28:31.315
Do what you like.

28:31.391 --> 28:34.883
I will, and I intend
to have a great time.

28:34.961 --> 28:37.054
Good. So do l.

28:38.031 --> 28:41.000
I just love to see everyone
having such a good time.

28:47.073 --> 28:48.836
Hold your breath.

28:48.908 --> 28:50.637
Okay.

28:55.014 --> 28:56.140
You did it.

28:56.382 --> 28:59.476
I can't believe one little
match set those suckers off.

28:59.552 --> 29:04.251
Yeah, it must have been some new
ultra-sensitive device that Bill installed.

29:05.325 --> 29:08.317
You know something,
this calls for a celebration.

29:08.394 --> 29:09.986
You really are a genius.

29:10.063 --> 29:11.223
Thank you.

29:11.297 --> 29:15.529
What would you say
to dinner for two with wine?

29:16.002 --> 29:17.629
You have dinner for two
in your purse?

29:17.704 --> 29:20.468
Well, I was gonna have that
with Bill later on.

29:20.540 --> 29:23.668
I think I've got
an opener here in my...

29:23.743 --> 29:25.108
Backpacker's Pal.

29:25.178 --> 29:27.043
No, I have one here. See?
Good. Okay.

29:28.748 --> 29:31.444
And, for the main course...

29:32.318 --> 29:33.478
Chocolate!

29:33.553 --> 29:35.646
Well, I'm a bit
of a chocoholic...

29:35.722 --> 29:38.054
but you can think of it
as veal piccata.

29:38.124 --> 29:39.751
No, chocolate's fine.

29:39.826 --> 29:41.020
All right.
Want some wine?

29:41.094 --> 29:43.460
Yeah, and look
what I've got in here, too.

29:43.630 --> 29:45.461
Got some wine glasses.

29:45.531 --> 29:46.759
Isn't that cute?

29:46.833 --> 29:48.061
That's great.

29:48.668 --> 29:51.569
Herb knew what he was doing
when he got this for me.

29:53.773 --> 29:56.264
You know how to do that?
Yeah, you just...

29:56.609 --> 29:57.769
All right.

30:06.653 --> 30:07.745
Thank you.

30:07.820 --> 30:09.481
Thank you.

30:20.433 --> 30:21.957
It's not the company.

30:23.803 --> 30:25.168
It's lack of air.

30:26.272 --> 30:27.534
Lack of air.

30:28.908 --> 30:30.637
You know, it's incredible.

30:31.511 --> 30:33.604
It's probably
just a matter of minutes...

30:33.680 --> 30:36.171
before we both
start hallucinating.

30:37.717 --> 30:40.311
We'll probably go through
this incredible...

30:40.920 --> 30:44.788
cosmic experience together
just before we kick off.

30:45.358 --> 30:47.758
Don't say that.
We're not gonna kick off.

30:49.729 --> 30:51.356
You know, it's funny.

30:51.764 --> 30:55.996
I never really thought about
not being here before.

30:57.837 --> 31:01.102
Kind of gives you a different
perspective on life, you know.

31:03.910 --> 31:05.502
Can you keep a secret?

31:06.879 --> 31:07.903
Sure.

31:10.283 --> 31:12.717
I feel like me with you.

31:15.354 --> 31:16.719
That seems right.

31:17.490 --> 31:19.424
I mean, who else would you be?

31:19.659 --> 31:21.126
Somebody else.

31:22.328 --> 31:24.888
No, what I mean is,
you know, I'm always...

31:25.064 --> 31:27.123
I'm really never me, you know.

31:27.200 --> 31:28.599
I've always tried to be...

31:28.668 --> 31:30.898
what somebody else
might want me to be.

31:30.970 --> 31:33.131
But I don't feel like that
with you.

31:33.439 --> 31:35.373
It's nice because,
I mean, look...

31:35.441 --> 31:37.841
I've only known you,
what is it...

31:38.711 --> 31:39.939
13 hours.

31:40.313 --> 31:42.747
I don't know, it seems like
I've known you at least...

31:42.815 --> 31:44.373
14 hours.

31:49.222 --> 31:50.450
That was funny.

31:52.759 --> 31:55.922
No, seriously. Have you ever
had that kind of an experience?

31:55.995 --> 31:58.293
You mean, trying to
impress other people?

31:58.364 --> 31:59.558
Yeah.

32:00.166 --> 32:02.031
You know, that's what's nice.

32:02.101 --> 32:04.831
See, I don't feel that
I have to impress you.

32:05.371 --> 32:07.236
And it's a good feeling.

32:07.306 --> 32:09.797
It's the same kind of feeling
I have with my father.

32:09.876 --> 32:12.811
I don't feel that I have to
impress him, either. I mean...

32:12.879 --> 32:15.905
bail him out and keep him
away from people, maybe.

32:15.982 --> 32:17.472
But impress him...

32:17.550 --> 32:19.279
no, never. Never.

32:21.554 --> 32:23.112
We need music.

32:31.998 --> 32:33.590
Were you ever married?

32:34.834 --> 32:36.563
I'm gonna find a station.

32:38.237 --> 32:39.932
Why do you do that?

32:40.139 --> 32:41.470
Do what?

32:41.974 --> 32:45.239
Every time I ask you something about
yourself, you change the subject.

32:45.311 --> 32:46.403
No, I don't.

32:46.479 --> 32:47.969
Yes, you do.

32:49.215 --> 32:51.342
You don't want anybody
to get to know you?

32:51.417 --> 32:53.544
No, I don't do that.
That's not true.

32:56.322 --> 32:58.256
I'm gonna find another station.

33:18.411 --> 33:19.400
So...

33:21.848 --> 33:24.339
anyway, there we were,
Herb and l...

33:25.384 --> 33:27.249
we were hiding out...

33:28.588 --> 33:32.991
and we had to camp out on the
Bodensee for three whole days...

33:33.059 --> 33:35.152
with nothing to eat
but chocolate.

33:43.636 --> 33:45.570
Are you hallucinating?

33:47.540 --> 33:49.804
Mean Ralphie Hansen.

33:49.876 --> 33:51.138
Where?

33:51.344 --> 33:52.504
No. No.

33:52.979 --> 33:55.311
When I was in the third grade...

33:55.381 --> 33:57.349
mean Ralphie Hansen...

33:58.584 --> 34:01.178
walked home from school
the same way I did.

34:02.355 --> 34:04.619
He was a big kid.
Sixth grader.

34:05.892 --> 34:07.917
Everyone knew
he carried a knife.

34:09.629 --> 34:10.994
What did you do?

34:12.063 --> 34:16.194
I ran home every afternoon
for the whole year.

34:18.504 --> 34:19.732
I was scared.

34:26.712 --> 34:28.976
I don't think
I ever told anybody that.

34:33.786 --> 34:35.413
And, yes, I was married.

34:37.523 --> 34:40.389
<i>And now,
for all you strangers out there...</i>

34:40.458 --> 34:42.552
<i>wherever you are,
here's hoping...</i>

34:47.867 --> 34:49.266
You want to dance?

34:49.768 --> 34:50.827
Me?

34:50.902 --> 34:51.995
Yeah.

34:53.139 --> 34:54.663
You mean right now?

34:54.739 --> 34:56.367
What else you gotta do?

34:57.743 --> 34:59.472
I'm not much of a dancer.

34:59.545 --> 35:01.172
Who's gonna notice?

35:03.049 --> 35:04.038
Come on.

35:04.817 --> 35:06.045
Okay.

35:06.118 --> 35:07.585
Pull me up.

35:08.587 --> 35:09.747
I'd love to.

35:12.158 --> 35:13.921
Would you excuse us?
Excuse us.

35:13.993 --> 35:15.358
Pardon me.
Sorry.

35:15.428 --> 35:16.759
Here's a spot.

35:28.174 --> 35:29.573
You know...

35:30.609 --> 35:33.874
I have this theory that...

35:34.313 --> 35:38.249
you can really tell when you might
be compatible with somebody...

35:38.317 --> 35:40.547
by the way you dance together.

35:41.687 --> 35:45.179
Now, the Count,
you know, Stefen...

35:46.559 --> 35:48.686
he couldn't dance a step.

35:50.096 --> 35:51.393
And Bill?

35:51.597 --> 35:53.656
Bill? Oh, Bill.

35:55.468 --> 35:57.766
Bill never takes me dancing.

36:06.746 --> 36:08.976
You know, it's just
possible that Bill...

36:09.048 --> 36:10.037
What?

36:11.884 --> 36:15.479
No, it's nothing.
It's a bad habit of mine.

36:15.554 --> 36:17.852
Investigating when
I should be dancing.

36:38.677 --> 36:39.871
Excuse me.

36:42.481 --> 36:44.574
It looks like you're having
a wonderful time.

36:44.650 --> 36:46.618
I am.
Good, I'm glad.

36:50.289 --> 36:53.452
Look, I'm sorry.
I was supposed to go away.

36:53.526 --> 36:55.926
On the weekend
my cousin and I come in town?

36:55.995 --> 36:57.587
Look, I wanted to see you.

36:57.663 --> 37:00.461
But every time your cousin
Elena comes in town...

37:00.533 --> 37:01.864
we wind up fighting.

37:01.934 --> 37:04.266
This isn't a fight.
It's a...

37:07.406 --> 37:08.498
We do?

37:11.744 --> 37:13.837
My cousin's not in town
right now.

37:15.648 --> 37:16.945
Wanna dance?

37:17.716 --> 37:19.650
I thought you would never ask.

37:28.627 --> 37:30.527
<i>As our air supply dwindled...</i>

37:30.596 --> 37:33.224
<i>Susan and I got
sleepier and sleepier.</i>

37:33.299 --> 37:36.063
<i>I knew I had to do something
to get us out of there.</i>

37:36.135 --> 37:38.228
<i>And it suddenly occurred to me.</i>

37:38.938 --> 37:40.633
<i>When the wires shorted out...</i>

37:40.706 --> 37:43.231
<i>the code could have
gotten scrambled.</i>

37:43.309 --> 37:46.039
<i>Maybe it was just a matter of
trying combinations of numbers...</i>

37:46.112 --> 37:47.636
<i>to get the door open.</i>

37:55.688 --> 37:58.156
<i>I know what you're thinking,
and you're right.</i>

37:58.224 --> 38:02.752
<i>The odds of my hitting upon just the right
combination of numbers was pretty remote.</i>

38:08.467 --> 38:11.197
<i>But then, you've gotta take
into account the luck factor.</i>

38:11.270 --> 38:13.397
Susan?
Hey.

38:13.806 --> 38:14.898
Huh?

38:16.008 --> 38:17.373
Hello.

38:18.410 --> 38:19.536
Who are you?

38:19.612 --> 38:20.977
Yoo-hoo!

38:21.046 --> 38:23.844
Where are you?

38:24.183 --> 38:27.846
<i>♪ Strangers in the night ♪</i>

38:28.354 --> 38:31.255
<i>♪ Exchanging glances ♪</i>

38:31.323 --> 38:32.415
Susan?

38:32.491 --> 38:33.719
Yes?

38:34.927 --> 38:36.724
Susan, what are you doing here?

38:36.795 --> 38:38.262
I'm dancing.

38:39.265 --> 38:40.289
Bill!

38:48.322 --> 38:50.790
Bill, I have to talk to you.

38:52.893 --> 38:54.053
I think I can explain.

38:54.128 --> 38:57.029
It's not what you think.
I'm a private investigator.

38:57.898 --> 38:59.331
Private investigator?

38:59.400 --> 39:01.197
Bill, I can't marry you.

39:01.268 --> 39:03.964
Susan, don't you think
this could wait?

39:04.171 --> 39:06.230
No, no, I have to tell him now.

39:06.307 --> 39:09.037
Now, while all the fresh air
is giving me courage.

39:09.109 --> 39:12.408
Get over there.
Bill, don't take it so hard.

39:12.813 --> 39:14.644
You didn't come here for us.

39:14.715 --> 39:16.512
So you found the money.

39:16.583 --> 39:19.074
You see, even if I hadn't...

39:19.153 --> 39:20.882
Oh, you know about the money?

39:20.955 --> 39:23.355
I think this is where
he tells us about Argentina.

39:23.424 --> 39:25.289
No, Rio, actually.

39:25.960 --> 39:29.361
Which is where I'll be going just
as soon as I get my passport.

39:29.697 --> 39:32.723
Oh. Are we going to Rio?

39:33.000 --> 39:34.934
No, no. Not we. Me.

39:36.003 --> 39:37.300
I'm going to Rio.

39:37.371 --> 39:40.738
You mean you weren't
going to propose?

39:41.175 --> 39:43.643
No, I was going to let you
and your father take the fall.

39:43.711 --> 39:44.871
I'm sorry, Susan.

39:44.945 --> 39:48.813
But all my life I've been a
brown paper bag in a Gucci world.

39:49.583 --> 39:52.245
Everybody's entitled to
one shot at success...

39:52.319 --> 39:54.082
and this was my chance.

39:54.154 --> 39:56.122
I never planned
on telling you all this.

39:56.190 --> 39:59.023
If I hadn't forgotten
the darned passport...

39:59.093 --> 40:01.493
you would never even
had to see me again.

40:02.396 --> 40:03.863
Try to understand.

40:07.901 --> 40:08.959
Well...

40:09.970 --> 40:12.530
I guess there's nothing else
to say except...

40:14.308 --> 40:15.707
<i>hasta luego.</i>

40:17.311 --> 40:18.369
Wait.

40:25.686 --> 40:28.154
All right. Get over...
Get over there.

40:34.828 --> 40:36.420
Bill...
Quiet.

40:37.131 --> 40:38.223
Bill.

40:39.767 --> 40:44.101
I'm afraid you have just outsmarted
yourself, Mr. Private lnvestigator.

40:50.110 --> 40:52.578
Hey, hey! What is it?

40:57.785 --> 41:00.310
Shut it off! How do you
shut this thing off?

41:05.225 --> 41:06.920
Turn it off. Get it off.

41:13.734 --> 41:15.224
I'm sorry, Bill.

41:15.335 --> 41:18.168
I'm sorry. It's just that
you look so wet.

41:20.207 --> 41:21.731
All right. All right.

41:26.814 --> 41:29.339
So, what did you do
with the real money?

41:31.685 --> 41:34.051
I had it transferred
to a Swiss account.

41:36.123 --> 41:38.057
I've been planning this
for three years.

41:38.125 --> 41:39.922
Ever since I found out
that your old man is...

41:39.993 --> 41:41.085
Is Herb.

41:41.161 --> 41:42.788
"Rembrandt."
Norton.

41:50.104 --> 41:53.301
So, you got together
with my father...

41:53.373 --> 41:55.705
and you cooked all this up?

41:55.843 --> 41:57.811
No. I never met him.

42:02.349 --> 42:04.817
An old rival of his,
Lefty Shultz...

42:06.787 --> 42:09.756
he came to me with
this idea to frame him.

42:13.260 --> 42:15.558
Lefty's the one
that printed the money.

42:18.732 --> 42:20.427
Come on, Bill.
I'll just take the gun.

42:20.501 --> 42:23.334
Oh, no, you don't.
Get over there.

42:25.939 --> 42:30.342
Those little poems you
recited were inspirational.

42:30.811 --> 42:33.871
Well, they're not poems, really.

42:34.181 --> 42:35.341
Whatever.

42:35.415 --> 42:37.007
They were inspiring.

42:37.217 --> 42:39.845
They reminded me a lot
of my favorite poet...

42:39.920 --> 42:41.581
Kahlil Gibran.

42:41.655 --> 42:43.555
You ever read Kahlil Gibran?

42:44.324 --> 42:45.814
Not recently, no.

42:46.393 --> 42:48.827
I'll send you a copy
of one of his books.

42:48.896 --> 42:51.456
Just my way of saying thanks.

42:51.532 --> 42:52.897
Jonathan?

42:55.269 --> 42:56.429
Well...

42:57.604 --> 42:59.572
see you next year, Johnny.

43:03.677 --> 43:04.769
Toodle-oo.

43:07.881 --> 43:09.007
Quite.

43:20.093 --> 43:22.425
Hey, man. This is strange.

43:22.496 --> 43:24.930
You're right. I don't know what's
wrong with me this morning.

43:24.998 --> 43:28.297
No, no, no. I mean,
look what I found in the bathroom.

43:28.368 --> 43:30.893
Soap, shampoo, toothpaste.

43:31.305 --> 43:33.068
It's not all that strange,
T.C.

43:33.140 --> 43:36.234
It is if the guy who lives
here took off for the weekend.

43:36.843 --> 43:39.403
Plus, here's his duffel bag
with all his clothes packed.

43:39.479 --> 43:40.571
So?

43:41.248 --> 43:44.217
The thing is,
he left all this stuff here.

43:45.052 --> 43:47.850
You think that maybe he
didn't go to the Big lsland?

43:47.921 --> 43:49.912
That's what it looks like to me.

43:51.091 --> 43:52.353
Where is Magnum?

43:52.426 --> 43:55.554
We don't know. We thought that
he went to the Big lsland.

43:56.029 --> 43:58.156
I might have known.

44:01.201 --> 44:03.965
Without the slightest thought
for the consequences...

44:04.037 --> 44:06.801
he left the Ferrari parked
in a 20-minute zone.

44:06.873 --> 44:08.306
Yeah, but we found
his stuff here.

44:08.375 --> 44:11.208
12 hours ago.
What did you say?

44:11.545 --> 44:13.775
I said, I don't think
he went anywhere.

44:13.847 --> 44:15.337
Where did you say
he parked the car?

44:18.986 --> 44:20.749
There go his eyes.

44:23.724 --> 44:25.885
I think he's gonna nod off.

44:27.261 --> 44:30.424
When he does, I'll get the gun.

44:31.798 --> 44:35.564
You know, I never for a minute
believed he was going to propose.

44:37.070 --> 44:38.367
You didn't?

44:38.438 --> 44:39.871
No kidding.

44:41.775 --> 44:43.367
You know, I can't figure it out.

44:44.911 --> 44:46.606
Guy like that...

44:46.680 --> 44:49.740
could have had someone
as wonderful as you...

44:49.816 --> 44:51.010
and he blows it.

44:51.084 --> 44:53.746
For what? Money?
Doesn't make sense.

44:55.088 --> 44:56.350
Am I hallucinating...

44:56.423 --> 44:59.688
or did you just say
something very sweet?

44:59.760 --> 45:02.320
Hey! Stop talking.

45:09.970 --> 45:11.403
I am hallucinating.

45:11.471 --> 45:13.837
I think I see
Mr. Halliburton.

45:16.476 --> 45:17.943
Campbell?

45:18.011 --> 45:19.842
It is Mr. Halliburton.

45:21.214 --> 45:23.375
In all my years of banking...

45:23.450 --> 45:26.146
never have I had an employee
locked in the vault.

45:26.219 --> 45:27.584
Magnum, how could you?

45:27.654 --> 45:29.952
Me? It wasn't my idea.

45:30.090 --> 45:31.489
It was my fault.

45:31.758 --> 45:34.158
She's right.
It was her fault.

45:34.227 --> 45:36.491
Hey, he's got a gun!
Wait a minute, I got him!

45:38.098 --> 45:39.827
All right, I got it!

45:45.806 --> 45:47.569
Oh, my God.

46:00.387 --> 46:02.321
Hi.
Hi.

46:02.389 --> 46:05.790
I knocked, but I can understand
why you didn't hear me.

46:07.294 --> 46:08.522
Come on in.

46:11.098 --> 46:12.429
How're you doing?

46:12.499 --> 46:15.093
Fine. Just fine.
How are you?

46:15.902 --> 46:17.301
Fine.

46:17.371 --> 46:18.702
Herb? How's Herb?

46:18.772 --> 46:20.000
Fine.

46:21.375 --> 46:23.741
Herb's been working
on a special plate.

46:23.810 --> 46:25.107
10's or 20's?

46:26.513 --> 46:28.481
This kind.
I brought you one.

46:29.883 --> 46:31.407
The Eiffel Tower.

46:32.486 --> 46:33.612
He's...

46:33.687 --> 46:37.350
He's been asked to do a whole
series of commemorative plates.

46:37.424 --> 46:39.415
And this is the first one.

46:39.493 --> 46:43.122
His life of crime is over,
I think. I hope.

46:43.196 --> 46:44.857
That's terrific.

46:45.565 --> 46:46.930
May I?

46:48.568 --> 46:51.366
He's also going to go
on a world tour...

46:51.438 --> 46:53.497
to make
the preliminary sketches...

46:53.573 --> 46:55.803
and he's asked me
to go along with him.

46:55.876 --> 46:58.071
Kind of like
we'd be out camping again.

46:58.145 --> 46:59.442
Are you gonna go?

46:59.513 --> 47:00.878
Well, I figure I might as well.

47:00.947 --> 47:03.177
I mean, after all,
I still have my...

47:03.250 --> 47:05.150
Backpacker's Pal.

47:08.855 --> 47:10.379
This is...

47:11.258 --> 47:13.351
It's very nice, thank you.

47:14.127 --> 47:17.756
This can't really make up for
everything you did for me.

47:19.766 --> 47:21.757
I didn't do anything.

47:21.835 --> 47:23.462
Yes, you did.

47:23.537 --> 47:26.768
The time I spent with you
changed my entire life.

47:29.376 --> 47:30.741
Come here.

47:38.552 --> 47:40.782
Well, I've got a job to quit.

47:41.321 --> 47:43.084
Send me a postcard.

47:43.490 --> 47:44.787
One a country.
