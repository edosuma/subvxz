WEBVTT

01:21.122 --> 01:23.124
- What was that?
- J2's no longer--

01:27.629 --> 01:29.756
Captain, I've lost contact
with the Robinsons.

01:29.839 --> 01:31.549
- Anything?
- Radar is clear.

01:31.633 --> 01:34.427
Wait... contact. Bearing zero-six-zero.

01:34.511 --> 01:35.720
Potential conjunction.

01:39.891 --> 01:41.017
What is that?

02:30.233 --> 02:31.067
Ready?

03:09.063 --> 03:11.482
The new potassium ratio
seems to be working out.

03:12.066 --> 03:13.026
It sure is.

04:25.348 --> 04:26.683
Think this'll work?

04:27.141 --> 04:28.351
It's worth a try.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.015
Wake up.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.394
Mom! Get up here!

05:18.651 --> 05:20.111
Hang on a sec.

05:20.194 --> 05:22.947
Oh, come on.
This is both cruel and unusual.

05:23.448 --> 05:24.949
Do you have any influence over them?

05:25.033 --> 05:27.535
I try not to abuse my power.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.248
<i>♪ The snow's comin' down... ♪</i>

05:32.332 --> 05:34.542
-This was your top secret project?
-Mm-hmm.

05:34.625 --> 05:37.003
<i>♪ I'm watchin' it fall  ♪</i>

05:37.086 --> 05:39.464
It was easier getting a tree
from a lot in Glendale.

05:39.547 --> 05:41.382
This is the glowing moss
from the shore.

05:41.466 --> 05:44.385
-Look. Kinda reminds me of you know who.
-Mm-hmm.

05:44.761 --> 05:45.845
Maybe a little.

05:45.928 --> 05:47.555
<i>♪ The church bells in town... ♪</i>

05:47.638 --> 05:50.141
-Happy Holidays, everybody!
- You look different.

05:50.224 --> 05:51.559
Yeah, he finally showered.

05:51.642 --> 05:53.102
I want to smell good for Santa.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.562
- Can we open presents?
- Yes!

05:54.645 --> 05:58.316
I wanna go first! I wanna go first.
Okay. You guys, this right here

05:58.399 --> 06:00.568
is my very last bottle of whiskey.

06:00.651 --> 06:02.487
I want you to have it,
in case of an emergency.

06:03.696 --> 06:05.198
We haven't had one of those in a while.

06:05.281 --> 06:07.367
- Do we have to wait that long?
-No.

06:07.450 --> 06:08.743
Hey, Will.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.328
Merry Christmas, buddy.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.163
Thanks, Dad!

06:12.580 --> 06:14.082
- Present time!
- Let's do this!

06:14.165 --> 06:15.041
Come on.

06:15.958 --> 06:16.793
Wow.

06:26.260 --> 06:27.095
Ooh.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.766
-Time you learned how to drive.

06:31.849 --> 06:33.476
I couldn't exactly wrap the Chariot.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.270
-Nice! Yeah, buddy.
-Thanks, Dad.

06:36.354 --> 06:40.900
Um, you don't actually need the key
to drive, or lessons, or permission.

06:40.983 --> 06:43.820
This is for Penny.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.824
Um, how is it for Penny
if everyone but Penny gets one?

06:48.074 --> 06:48.908
Here.

06:49.492 --> 06:50.993
- Did she write this?
-Thank you.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.371
So, um...

06:53.830 --> 06:56.874
Penny's been writing kind
of a memoir about our experience.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.919
It's really good, so I published it.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.671
-Wow!
-Wow!

07:01.754 --> 07:03.214
Are we really doing this?

07:03.297 --> 07:05.341
It's called <i>Lost in Space.</i>

07:05.425 --> 07:06.717
Hmm, good title.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.761
"Our Jupiter was hurtling
through the atmosphere

07:08.845 --> 07:10.555
at 25 times the speed of sound.

07:11.514 --> 07:12.807
We were going to crash...

07:13.850 --> 07:14.809
but for me

07:15.518 --> 07:16.894
this wasn't the scary part.

07:18.020 --> 07:20.898
The scary part happened long before
anything went wrong,

07:21.399 --> 07:24.277
when we were sailing merrily
on a trip to Alpha Centauri,

07:24.777 --> 07:26.571
because the idea of space

07:27.405 --> 07:29.740
has scared me for as long as
I can remember."

07:30.199 --> 07:31.033
Is that true?

07:31.367 --> 07:32.743
No interrupting.

07:32.827 --> 07:35.037
"I always thought space
was darker than dark

07:35.872 --> 07:36.998
and colder than cold,

07:37.832 --> 07:40.334
and worst of all, empty.

07:41.043 --> 07:43.087
I can't think of a lonelier place.

07:44.213 --> 07:46.757
My mom thinks that space isn't empty
after all.

07:46.841 --> 07:49.594
That it's filled with dark matter
we just can't see.

07:50.428 --> 07:51.888
I'm not a scientist like her.

07:52.722 --> 07:56.017
I don't believe in things just because
they make the equations add up.

07:56.517 --> 07:58.311
I need to learn things for myself

07:58.936 --> 08:01.397
and that's where the trouble always
starts.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.107
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.610
This is the story of discovery...

08:06.444 --> 08:08.112
but not of strange new worlds.

08:08.196 --> 08:11.491
It's about discovering what's
in the places you thought were empty.

08:12.700 --> 08:13.659
Sometimes

08:14.452 --> 08:16.454
it's the invisible force of my family...

08:17.622 --> 08:20.082
pulling at me,
even when I can't see them...

08:22.460 --> 08:23.544
reminding me...

08:26.464 --> 08:28.049
...that I'm never really alone.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.220
And sometimes it's about discovering

08:32.303 --> 08:34.263
horrible monsters that want
to bite your face off."

08:47.818 --> 08:49.195
During World War I...

08:50.154 --> 08:51.656
there was one Christmas

08:52.406 --> 08:54.033
where the French and the Germans

08:54.116 --> 08:56.118
decided to stop shooting at one another

08:56.744 --> 08:59.497
and came out of the trenches
to celebrate together.

09:01.916 --> 09:02.959
Peace on Earth.

09:03.709 --> 09:04.585
You know?

09:05.836 --> 09:06.879
We're not on Earth.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.801
I just wanted to wish everyone
a Merry Christmas.

09:11.884 --> 09:12.885
Now you have.

09:16.514 --> 09:17.765
Is that the breach alarm?

09:17.848 --> 09:18.891
On it.

09:29.527 --> 09:30.570
How we doin'?

09:31.237 --> 09:32.238
Still in the green.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.532
The winds are starting to shift, though.

09:34.615 --> 09:36.617
I think monsoon season's finally coming.

09:36.951 --> 09:38.411
Methane monsoon season.

09:39.453 --> 09:43.207
There'll be fewer rocks blown at us
when the wind's blowing from the sea.

09:44.083 --> 09:47.837
Anybody else think it's ironic
that on the last planet we were marooned

09:47.920 --> 09:49.380
because we ran out of fuel

09:49.463 --> 09:51.841
and on this planet
we have the fuel for air,

09:51.924 --> 09:53.092
but no way to use it?

09:53.175 --> 09:56.095
-I don't believe in irony.
-Which is, in fact, ironic.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.930
Hey, Will. You ready to roll?

10:02.018 --> 10:05.229
Hey, untense your shoulders.
Relaxed arms means more control.

10:05.771 --> 10:06.606
Okay.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.109
Don't pump the brakes
unless you wanna stop.

10:10.192 --> 10:11.319
Yeah, okay.

10:12.069 --> 10:14.071
Say, why don't we give it some more gas?

10:14.780 --> 10:15.615
Gas?

10:15.698 --> 10:17.783
It's an expression from when I was young.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.327
Means more acceleration.

10:20.036 --> 10:20.870
Oh.

10:25.333 --> 10:26.542
Why'd you do that?

10:26.834 --> 10:28.628
You don't need to look at the speed
right now.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.588
I just want you to get a feel
for the machine.

10:30.671 --> 10:33.174
Yeah. Feel for the machine.

10:34.216 --> 10:35.259
How's this?

10:36.052 --> 10:37.011
You're doing great.

10:39.263 --> 10:40.097
Hey!

10:41.432 --> 10:43.267
-I'll race you.
-Penny.

10:45.728 --> 10:48.230
Give him a break.
He doesn't want to hit anything.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.316
There is nothing here to hit.

10:50.524 --> 10:52.526
Your brother's a man
after my own heart.

10:53.110 --> 10:55.071
Not enough attention is paid
in this family

10:55.154 --> 10:57.156
to the benefits of a cautious approach.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.949
-Huh.

10:59.533 --> 11:01.035
It's time to take out the trash.

11:01.118 --> 11:02.870
Hey, please be gentle.

11:02.953 --> 11:04.497
Just a friendly reminder:

11:04.580 --> 11:06.040
these are the only ones we have left.

11:06.123 --> 11:09.377
They barely charge our space suits
and our oxygen-generating system.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.462
How many of these is it gonna take

11:11.545 --> 11:14.006
for us to save enough power
to actually take off?

11:14.090 --> 11:17.677
Well, given the Jupiter's full launch
system requirement's

11:17.760 --> 11:20.971
in the 200-kilowatt range,
you're gonna have to ask your mother.

11:22.223 --> 11:25.309
Knowing her, she's probably still looking
for a way to get us out of here.

11:27.228 --> 11:28.521
Yeah, I hope so.

11:42.451 --> 11:43.661
How was your lesson?

11:44.161 --> 11:48.040
You know, I'm, uh, just getting a feel
for the machine.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.376
Show's about to start.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.442
What'd you get me for Christmas?

12:15.192 --> 12:17.862
This is what you give me
every day.

12:17.945 --> 12:19.572
Well, you did this to yourself.

12:25.327 --> 12:27.455
Your mother must trust
and depend on you a lot

12:27.538 --> 12:29.623
to give you such an important job
as looking after me.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.542
Yeah, it's right up there
with mopping the floor

12:31.625 --> 12:33.419
-and cleaning out the carbon traps.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.838
I didn't realize you were so undervalued.

12:35.921 --> 12:37.298
Doesn't seem fair.

12:38.632 --> 12:39.633
Is that a new patch?

12:40.092 --> 12:42.428
Did that have anything to do
with the alarm earlier?

12:43.429 --> 12:45.389
I just want to know how safe I am here.

12:46.307 --> 12:48.726
You're as safe as you were yesterday,
okay?

12:54.106 --> 12:55.149
Here we go.

12:57.234 --> 12:58.402
Like clockwork,

12:59.028 --> 13:01.280
down to the minute every 23 days.

13:01.739 --> 13:03.324
How is... how is that possible?

13:03.407 --> 13:05.367
There's a remote spot in Venezuela

13:05.451 --> 13:08.579
where they have lightning storms
in the exact time and place

13:08.662 --> 13:12.374
265 days a year,
and nobody knows why that happens either.

13:12.875 --> 13:15.377
-They call it the Beacon of Maracaibo.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.379
And it's guided sailors for centuries.

13:20.549 --> 13:24.220
If you have clouds and sun, or two suns,

13:24.303 --> 13:25.846
to heat them up,

13:26.931 --> 13:28.682
you're going to have lightning.

13:29.099 --> 13:31.268
That much is true no matter where you are.

13:53.791 --> 13:56.293
You've got this.
You've got this whole puzzle.

13:56.377 --> 13:59.046
-You're gonna figure it out.
- See, here's the thing...

13:59.880 --> 14:00.881
- Hey.
-Hey.

14:06.804 --> 14:10.015
See, here's the thing,
the trick about puzzles is that...

14:10.432 --> 14:12.059
-Wait, hold on.
-Just finish that thought.

14:12.142 --> 14:13.686
-You can keep going.
-Take your time. It's fine.

14:16.939 --> 14:17.940
That was a good day.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.233
Yeah, it was.

14:23.988 --> 14:25.072
I've been thinking...

14:26.699 --> 14:27.533
the lightning.

14:28.117 --> 14:31.161
We could recharge the batteries
then jumpstart the Jupiter.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.289
We could get off this planet.

14:33.372 --> 14:35.082
But to get to the storms,
we'd have to fly.

14:35.165 --> 14:36.667
No, we don't have to fly.

14:45.634 --> 14:46.510
This is crazy.

14:46.969 --> 14:50.097
People have been using this technology
for thousands of years.

14:50.180 --> 14:52.725
-Why are you bringing this up now?
-The winds are changing

14:52.808 --> 14:54.351
and I-- I think we have a window.

14:54.435 --> 14:57.187
And if we miss it, it's--
It's going to be another year.

14:57.271 --> 14:59.189
This is about that thing in the garage.

14:59.273 --> 15:01.275
That thing in the garage

15:02.359 --> 15:04.612
brought us halfway across the universe.

15:05.821 --> 15:07.823
It's the only way
we're gonna get to Alpha Centauri.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.199
I thought you'd given up on it.

15:09.283 --> 15:11.744
You don't have to understand a tool
to use it.

15:12.411 --> 15:16.665
The robot's engine is inert,
it's as... asleep.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.417
and the last time it worked

15:18.542 --> 15:19.460
we were in space.

15:19.543 --> 15:21.670
We just need to recreate those conditions.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.881
And what if you still can't figure it out?

15:28.928 --> 15:31.013
Well, there are four other planets
in this system.

15:31.096 --> 15:32.932
I mean, maybe one of them is better.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.938
I'm not risking the lives of our kids

15:39.021 --> 15:40.481
because things may be better.

15:40.564 --> 15:42.358
Things can always be better,

15:42.441 --> 15:45.653
but sometimes you have to appreciate
what you've got.

15:53.160 --> 15:55.537
Our kids will never meet anyone new here.

15:56.914 --> 16:00.167
No friends... to confide in,

16:01.251 --> 16:03.629
or to challenge them
or to understand them.

16:05.464 --> 16:06.966
They'll never fall in love here.

16:07.049 --> 16:09.176
They'll never have families of their own.

16:12.846 --> 16:14.848
Babe, they'll never have what we have.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.227
We have to leave.

16:18.310 --> 16:19.269
That one...

16:20.187 --> 16:21.647
We have to try.

16:26.902 --> 16:28.654
I'm sorry. It's too dangerous.

16:33.826 --> 16:34.994
It's too dangerous.

16:37.329 --> 16:38.831
We'll revisit this in a year.

17:16.910 --> 17:17.828
No, no, no!

17:29.882 --> 17:30.716
John?

17:32.968 --> 17:34.219
- Mom, what's going on?
-John?

17:34.303 --> 17:35.345
- Mom?
- Mom?

17:35.429 --> 17:36.263
- Mom?
-Dad?

17:38.390 --> 17:39.850
-John?
- Dad?

17:42.978 --> 17:44.354
Ah!

17:44.438 --> 17:45.689
Get my com pack.

17:45.773 --> 17:46.774
Come on.<i> </i>Come on.

17:46.857 --> 17:48.859
-John, get out of there!
-Dad!

17:49.610 --> 17:51.278
Dad! Dad, come on! Dad!

17:51.487 --> 17:52.321
Mom!

17:52.738 --> 17:53.572
Dad!

17:53.655 --> 17:55.032
-Penny! Penny, help!
-Go!

17:55.365 --> 17:56.241
Dad, please!

17:56.325 --> 17:57.701
- John!

17:57.785 --> 17:59.078
-Dad!
- Okay!

17:59.161 --> 18:01.330
Make sure you close it
behind me, okay?

18:03.332 --> 18:04.291
Get back!

18:06.668 --> 18:07.669
John!

18:07.753 --> 18:09.713
-Come on, John. We gotta go, buddy.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.882
-Get up, get up, get up. Come on.
- Dad!

18:11.965 --> 18:13.550
I said get back!

18:13.634 --> 18:14.802
Come on! Okay.

18:14.885 --> 18:17.179
-Hang on. Come on, come on, come on.

18:23.018 --> 18:25.854
-John!
- Is he okay? Is he okay?

18:33.821 --> 18:36.949
Once the patch gave away
the atmosphere just forced its way in,

18:37.616 --> 18:38.575
sharp as a knife.

18:41.328 --> 18:42.579
How we gonna fix this?

18:44.123 --> 18:45.165
It'll be difficult.

18:53.841 --> 18:54.800
We're leaving.

18:57.845 --> 18:59.012
We are?

18:59.096 --> 19:00.305
We can do that?

19:02.015 --> 19:03.058
Tell them your plan.

19:03.934 --> 19:04.893
What plan?

19:13.735 --> 19:14.653
I got it.

19:30.294 --> 19:31.128
You got it?

19:41.972 --> 19:43.390
Where is it?

19:44.141 --> 19:46.643
-Have you seen the Jupiter flight manual?
-I'm the flight manual.

19:46.727 --> 19:47.978
-What do you need to know?
-Okay.

19:58.864 --> 20:01.533
<i>This is Will Robinson</i>
<i>of the 24th Colonist Group.</i>

20:02.284 --> 20:05.078
<i>I'm making a record of this,</i>
<i>because it seems</i>

20:05.996 --> 20:10.042
<i>we're the first humans to try and turn</i>
<i>a spaceship into a sailboat.</i>

20:17.424 --> 20:18.258
Don!

20:18.342 --> 20:19.551
I'm trying!

20:19.635 --> 20:21.261
Won't you just give me a second.

20:22.137 --> 20:23.013
I got it.

20:25.224 --> 20:28.143
I got it. I got it. I got it. Okay.

20:28.227 --> 20:32.064
Be careful! Is that good?

20:42.741 --> 20:45.244
By historic standards,
it's a pretty easy journey.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.955
I'm hoping to achieve a speed
of four to five knots.

20:48.038 --> 20:50.040
At a hundred nautical miles per day,

20:50.249 --> 20:51.959
that'll make it a two-day trip.

20:52.042 --> 20:55.337
Then we recharge the ship's battery
in the middle of a giant lightning storm.

20:55.420 --> 20:56.546
First, we need to get there.

20:56.630 --> 21:00.175
It's basically a straight shot.
We have to avoid this archipelago here,

21:00.259 --> 21:02.386
because it has a pretty jagged coastline.

21:02.469 --> 21:03.720
Um, how jagged?

21:03.804 --> 21:04.846
If we hit it, we sink.

21:04.972 --> 21:07.516
Which is why we are gonna steer
well clear of it.

21:07.599 --> 21:09.559
You said the monsoon winds
are changing by the day.

21:09.643 --> 21:11.979
They gonna push us in the direction
of the jagged coastline?

21:12.062 --> 21:13.272
Once the winds change, yes,

21:13.355 --> 21:15.649
but we have plenty of time
to get there before that happens.

21:16.191 --> 21:19.903
And luckily, your father has spent
half of his life on boats,

21:20.529 --> 21:22.531
and he's a pretty seasoned captain.

21:22.614 --> 21:24.616
We've been just a family for a while.

21:26.159 --> 21:28.620
We have to remember
how to be a crew again.

21:29.788 --> 21:30.872
Tomorrow's a big day.

21:31.999 --> 21:33.333
Let's get some rest.

21:38.922 --> 21:39.756
Hey.

21:40.882 --> 21:43.010
Practicing your knots with your gloves on?

21:43.218 --> 21:44.594
Just trying to be prepared.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.514
If we get the robot engine going,

21:48.890 --> 21:50.642
it can take us anywhere, right?

21:51.226 --> 21:54.479
Well, it should take us directly
to the colony on Alpha Centauri.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.527
I'm not going without him.

22:04.364 --> 22:05.365
Um...

22:06.366 --> 22:09.077
How would we even know
where to look for the robot?

22:09.578 --> 22:11.204
It's not like he left you a map

22:11.830 --> 22:13.457
or breadcrumbs to follow.

22:13.540 --> 22:14.374
Maybe he did.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.669
They're just
not on this tiny strip of beach.

22:23.216 --> 22:24.509
Maybe they're out there.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.483
How come she wrote more about you than me?

22:40.734 --> 22:42.402
Okay, okay, okay, okay. That's enough.

22:42.486 --> 22:44.738
-You know that's Daddy's special juice.

22:44.821 --> 22:46.281
You're too young...

22:50.035 --> 22:51.453
You made me look good.

22:53.497 --> 22:54.664
Artistic license.

22:55.791 --> 22:59.044
God, it's been a while
since I did anything worth writing about.

22:59.836 --> 23:01.671
Do you really want to go that bad?

23:01.755 --> 23:04.216
I've been working my whole life

23:04.299 --> 23:07.219
for the opportunity to do something
that actually matters.

23:07.302 --> 23:10.305
Growing the perfect ear
of corn isn't it.

23:10.555 --> 23:11.973
Nah, I would've stayed.

23:12.974 --> 23:14.184
Wanting to stay,

23:14.684 --> 23:16.770
it's different than being afraid to go.

23:17.729 --> 23:20.148
I just, I don't want to go through it
all again.

23:22.067 --> 23:25.362
I don't want to wonder if someone's gonna
have to save my life, or worse,

23:25.445 --> 23:26.947
if I have to save theirs.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.117
I just want things to be normal.

23:31.660 --> 23:33.662
Normal is out there somewhere.

23:34.746 --> 23:36.206
We just have to find it.

23:37.791 --> 23:38.625
Hey.

23:39.501 --> 23:41.545
I won't let you flub up anything on deck.

23:44.840 --> 23:47.676
By the way, I think Dad read it all
in one sitting.

23:50.679 --> 23:51.888
Is that Mom's copy?

23:53.849 --> 23:54.683
Um...

23:56.226 --> 23:58.228
Yeah, I'm sure she'll get around to it.

24:32.971 --> 24:34.097
Where are we going?

24:35.348 --> 24:36.183
Come on.

24:37.142 --> 24:39.144
You know, I'm a pretty good sailor myself.

24:39.227 --> 24:41.146
Hm, I'll keep that in mind.

24:55.660 --> 24:57.037
<i>All right, Robinsons.</i>

24:57.120 --> 24:58.788
Everybody hold on tight.

24:59.122 --> 25:01.124
Last chance. You sure she'll float?

25:01.416 --> 25:03.543
She'll float.

25:03.919 --> 25:04.920
Anchors aweigh.

25:06.296 --> 25:07.464
Whoa!

25:09.299 --> 25:10.509
Come on!

25:10.634 --> 25:12.719
Okay, everyone, man your stations.

25:13.428 --> 25:15.680
We're trying to sail downwind
without the use of a rudder,

25:15.764 --> 25:17.766
so you're gonna have to raise
and lower the halyards

25:17.849 --> 25:18.934
to keep us on course.

25:19.726 --> 25:20.852
Halyards?

25:21.311 --> 25:23.772
Ropes. Work the sails up and down.

25:24.022 --> 25:26.107
So halyard's just a fancy name
for rope?

25:26.358 --> 25:27.234
Got it.

25:27.317 --> 25:29.319
If the ship starts turning to port,

25:29.611 --> 25:32.656
you'll lower the starboard halyards,
and vice versa.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.366
Raise the halyards!

25:41.998 --> 25:43.583
I've gotta hand it to you, Maureen.

25:43.667 --> 25:46.795
A million little details needed
to make this voyage a success,

25:47.045 --> 25:49.005
and you thought of almost everything.

25:49.089 --> 25:51.091
-Almost?
-Almost.

25:52.801 --> 25:55.470
Anyone know the fancy word
for what we're doing right now?

26:01.142 --> 26:01.977
Sailing.

26:02.060 --> 26:04.437
<i>♪ I just want to celebrate</i> ♪

26:04.896 --> 26:07.065

26:07.857 --> 26:10.235

26:10.360 --> 26:13.196

26:13.280 --> 26:15.073
<i>♪ I put my faith in the people... ♪</i>

26:15.156 --> 26:16.825
Moving at a pretty good clip now.

26:16.908 --> 26:19.160
You've gotta admit,
it's pretty awesome, Penny.

26:19.244 --> 26:20.662
Oh, God.

26:21.580 --> 26:22.914
Mmm...

26:22.998 --> 26:24.749
Penny? Penny?

26:25.625 --> 26:29.337
<i>♪ Round, round, round, round ♪</i>

26:29.421 --> 26:32.048

26:37.137 --> 26:38.263
I'm not in the mood.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.599
Put an earplug in one ear!

26:40.682 --> 26:41.558
What?

26:41.641 --> 26:45.228
Put an earplug in one ear.

26:45.979 --> 26:47.647
It always works for me.

26:48.023 --> 26:50.859
I'm not vomiting out of my ear.

26:50.942 --> 26:53.320
It'll help
with the motion sickness.

26:53.945 --> 26:56.906
What have you got to lose?
You've already lost your lunch.

27:29.939 --> 27:30.774
John?

27:30.857 --> 27:33.568
<i>Can we increase the speed</i>
<i>by a couple of knots?</i>

27:33.652 --> 27:34.486
Why?

27:34.569 --> 27:36.071
Uh, the barometric pressure's dropping.

27:36.154 --> 27:38.615
I... I think there's a monsoon developing
behind us.

27:38.698 --> 27:40.742
<i> Is that the electrical</i>
<i>storm we're heading for?</i>

27:41.201 --> 27:44.954
<i>No. This is something else.</i>
<i>Something we don't want any part of.</i>

27:45.038 --> 27:46.665
I can get you a couple of knots.

27:46.748 --> 27:47.916
Then we'll be fine.

27:49.417 --> 27:50.293
Hey.

27:51.127 --> 27:53.213
It's so 19th century
trying to guess oncoming weather

27:53.296 --> 27:55.840
with a thermometer, a wind gauge
and a pressure reader.

27:55.924 --> 27:56.758
How about a tomato?

27:56.841 --> 27:58.843
Oh, that would be perfect.

27:58.927 --> 28:00.136
Oh, you're feeling better!

28:00.220 --> 28:03.932
Yeah, Dr. Smith showed me
this earplug thing and it worked.

28:04.015 --> 28:05.934
You shouldn't listen to anything she says.

28:06.017 --> 28:06.976
You know better.

28:07.477 --> 28:09.145
Don't let her get in your head.

28:09.604 --> 28:11.439
Well, I would still be vomiting.

28:11.523 --> 28:14.234
Maybe you shouldn't be
spending so much time with her.

28:25.453 --> 28:26.830
This isn't on the schedule.

28:27.622 --> 28:30.083
The beans are gross,
but everything else is good.

28:33.753 --> 28:34.587
Thank you.

28:35.171 --> 28:36.339
Thanks for the tip.

28:52.522 --> 28:53.606
Penny!

28:53.690 --> 28:54.899
Stop the ship!

28:54.983 --> 28:56.151
What? Why?

28:56.234 --> 28:58.945
Tell your dad to loft the sails!

28:59.446 --> 29:01.406
He needs to stop us now!

29:06.327 --> 29:07.287
God.

29:08.913 --> 29:10.999
- Everyone okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

29:11.624 --> 29:13.501
What the hell did we hit?

29:27.056 --> 29:28.475
We always knew it was risky.

29:29.058 --> 29:30.393
So, we're stuck here?

29:31.811 --> 29:32.937
Right now we are.

29:33.021 --> 29:34.898
I think we caught a break.

29:34.981 --> 29:36.983
The hull seems to be intact,
but in the meantime,

29:37.066 --> 29:39.068
let's not hit anything ever again.

29:39.152 --> 29:40.695
The pressure's dropped a lot lower.

29:40.779 --> 29:43.031
Okay, does everybody else
know what that means?

29:43.114 --> 29:45.283
-The monsoon's coming.
- Couldn't have just said that?

29:45.366 --> 29:47.911
Look, if we're still stuck here
when the monsoon hits,

29:47.994 --> 29:50.038
the ship's gonna totally crack apart.

29:51.331 --> 29:54.667
Not necessarily "totally crack apart,"
maybe a little crack.

29:54.751 --> 29:56.377
-I'll figure it out.
-Guys,

29:56.461 --> 29:58.671
let's go up on deck, draw in the sails.

29:59.422 --> 30:00.340
Go on.

30:01.424 --> 30:04.803
I'll go check on Ceedra.
Great talk, by the way.

30:09.349 --> 30:11.726
If you have to go to the bathroom,
just hold it.

30:12.727 --> 30:14.729
I knew we were going
to hit that reef.

30:16.147 --> 30:18.274
I could see the cross-currents.

30:19.526 --> 30:21.528
A good sailor can do that.

30:22.946 --> 30:24.322
No knock on your husband.

30:24.405 --> 30:25.615
Oh, you're a sailor?

30:26.115 --> 30:27.617
How did you learn to sail?

30:27.700 --> 30:29.285
What does it matter if I can help?

30:29.369 --> 30:31.412
I don't believe a word you say.

30:31.496 --> 30:32.914
Ask Penny.

30:33.206 --> 30:34.499
I can be useful!

30:34.999 --> 30:37.919
You're not getting out of there
no matter how hard you try.

30:53.017 --> 30:53.852
Hey, look.

30:53.935 --> 30:57.105
I know you're cranky and overworked, okay?
I've been there.

30:57.188 --> 30:59.566
That's why I need you to hold on
a little bit longer.

30:59.649 --> 31:00.483
Hm?

31:02.360 --> 31:03.278
Come on, baby,

31:03.361 --> 31:04.779
we all need to keep breathing.

31:04.863 --> 31:05.864
That's why I'm asking you.

31:05.947 --> 31:07.866
Give me a little more.

31:07.949 --> 31:10.034
Hey, Debbie, can you believe
I'm sweet talkin'

31:10.118 --> 31:11.911
a carbon dioxide removal assembly?

31:13.121 --> 31:15.874
Now I'm talking to a machine
and a chicken.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.543
I really need to get outta here.

31:19.711 --> 31:22.964
- How long have we been here?
- Too long.

31:23.256 --> 31:25.383
Didn't the robot call this place "danger"?

31:25.550 --> 31:26.384
Yeah.

31:26.467 --> 31:28.428
-We never should have left.
-That's not helping.

31:28.511 --> 31:29.554
Someone needed to say it.

31:35.685 --> 31:36.519
Guys...

31:40.607 --> 31:41.691
Guys, look.

31:43.276 --> 31:44.110
What is it?

31:47.405 --> 31:48.281
No way!

31:49.365 --> 31:51.701
- Did you call him here to help us?
- He's here?

32:01.920 --> 32:02.837
Hey.

32:08.718 --> 32:09.594
Hey, Will.

32:10.136 --> 32:11.471
I thought it was him, too.

32:17.602 --> 32:18.853
I've been talking to Don.

32:20.146 --> 32:23.816
And, uh, we think we can scrape together
enough power for a two-second burn.

32:26.861 --> 32:28.529
Might be enough to push us clear.

32:30.073 --> 32:31.157
That's it.

32:32.533 --> 32:34.452
Really? That's the answer?

32:34.535 --> 32:36.871
No. You and Don are the answer.

32:37.080 --> 32:37.914
We are?

32:39.958 --> 32:43.086
Using the popouts is a hell of a way
to lever us off the reef.

32:46.339 --> 32:48.925
It's my own fault
for being the strongest guy here.

32:50.385 --> 32:51.803
You're a close second.

32:57.100 --> 32:58.685
Whoa! We're free!

32:58.768 --> 33:00.561
At least we won't be here
when the storm hits.

33:00.645 --> 33:01.771
No, we'll be out there.

33:01.854 --> 33:03.481
-Any chance we can outrun it?
-Not anymore.

33:03.564 --> 33:04.983
Suit up. Crew on deck.

33:14.200 --> 33:15.368
Reef the sails!

33:23.418 --> 33:24.293
Hold on to me.

33:24.377 --> 33:27.046
We're gonna have to weather
this storm out the best we can.

33:29.257 --> 33:30.341
Okay.

33:42.895 --> 33:45.356
That is exactly what I wanted to avoid.

33:45.440 --> 33:46.649
<i>We have a problem.</i>

33:46.733 --> 33:47.567
What is it?

33:47.650 --> 33:50.528
When we hit the reef it seems
we sprung a leak after all,

33:50.611 --> 33:51.946
and it's dripping into Ceedra.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.823
If that shorts out, we're dead.

33:53.906 --> 33:56.034
I like breathing as much as you do.

33:56.909 --> 33:57.785
Can you patch it?

33:57.869 --> 33:58.870
I'm working on it.

33:59.495 --> 34:01.706
Just promise me
we won't hit anything else.

34:08.254 --> 34:09.672
We won't hit anything else.

34:10.214 --> 34:11.382
Look, Ceedra.

34:11.466 --> 34:14.886
If we could just hold on together
until the storm passes,

34:14.969 --> 34:16.387
-I would really ap--

34:16.471 --> 34:19.307
Okay, that's not holding it together,
baby!

34:22.560 --> 34:23.603
All right, I'm done!

34:23.686 --> 34:24.687
You're doing a great job!

34:25.271 --> 34:27.815
-Okay, we're... we're done here!
- Head down below.

34:28.524 --> 34:29.776
Oh, God.

34:31.110 --> 34:33.613
Hey, Jude, take my hand. Come on.

34:35.740 --> 34:37.825
Will! Get down!

34:40.328 --> 34:41.621
Will!

34:41.704 --> 34:43.706
Dad!

34:45.374 --> 34:46.209
Will!

34:46.667 --> 34:47.668
Dad!

34:47.752 --> 34:49.462
Come on!

34:51.047 --> 34:51.923
Will!

34:54.050 --> 34:55.093
Will!

34:55.885 --> 34:57.887
- Come on, Will!

34:58.763 --> 35:01.641
Got him? You got him.
Okay, we've got him.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.102
Dad, hold your breath. Hold your breath.

35:04.685 --> 35:06.062
We need to get them inside!

35:06.145 --> 35:08.856
Mom! Mom! We need you
in the med bay!

35:10.566 --> 35:12.443
- Dad?
- You're gonna be okay.

35:12.527 --> 35:13.361
Ah!

35:13.444 --> 35:14.821
I've gotta get back up there!

35:14.904 --> 35:16.864
Oh, no, you will not!
We have to sail the ship!

35:16.948 --> 35:19.367
-We don't know how to sail in this.
-Mom! We need your help!

35:19.492 --> 35:21.828
- What do we do?
- Mom? Mom?

35:21.911 --> 35:22.954
What do we do?

35:23.037 --> 35:24.038
Mom!

35:26.040 --> 35:27.500
You really know how to sail?

35:28.126 --> 35:29.252
We're wasting time.

35:29.335 --> 35:31.462
If this is another lie,
it'll be your last.

35:43.015 --> 35:45.059
Well, this is a sign
of the Apocalypse.

35:52.191 --> 35:53.192
Oh!

35:57.196 --> 35:58.406
Smith, what do we do?

36:01.701 --> 36:02.618
Smith!

36:04.120 --> 36:05.454
I knew this was a mistake!

36:05.538 --> 36:07.790
-Raise the sails.
-But we just brought them down!

36:07.874 --> 36:09.125
We need speed!

36:09.208 --> 36:11.627
We're too close to the rocks already.
We need to go around.

36:11.711 --> 36:12.587
We can't go around!

36:12.670 --> 36:15.006
-We have to go through!
- Through rocks?

36:15.089 --> 36:17.300
Raise the sails! Let's go!

36:23.055 --> 36:25.474
- Judy!
- Hey! Penny, hold on!

36:25.558 --> 36:28.019
Hey, I can't do this without you.

36:28.102 --> 36:32.106
Yeah, okay. Yeah, I'm getting up.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.024
Smith!

36:34.108 --> 36:36.110
- Go!
-Go!

36:37.320 --> 36:38.237
Good?

37:02.261 --> 37:04.805
Gotcha. We need to get the sail up now!

37:09.685 --> 37:11.020
Raise the sails!

37:23.282 --> 37:25.117
-Dad!

37:27.870 --> 37:28.955
Are we going faster?

37:39.298 --> 37:40.758
<i>Maureen, what's happening?</i>

37:40.841 --> 37:42.718
We're picking up speed.

37:42.802 --> 37:44.178
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

37:44.512 --> 37:45.596
Be careful.

37:46.055 --> 37:49.100
We're way past that...
but I appreciate the sentiment.

37:49.684 --> 37:50.559
You look worried.

37:50.643 --> 37:53.145
That's just my normal face now.

37:53.229 --> 37:55.231
Hey, Will, I trust your Mom.

37:57.942 --> 38:00.069
But... Mom's not in charge anymore.

38:13.457 --> 38:14.458
John...

38:14.542 --> 38:16.377
<i>We need to shift the weight to leeward.</i>

38:16.460 --> 38:18.963
Get the load side lower any way you can!

38:19.672 --> 38:20.589
The Chariot.

38:25.428 --> 38:28.014
The Chariot weighs two tons.

38:28.097 --> 38:29.974
Dad! Dad, are you okay?

38:30.057 --> 38:32.101
-You're gonna have to do this.
-I am?

38:32.184 --> 38:34.687
Turn radius is tight,
so you're gonna have to floor it.

38:34.770 --> 38:35.688
But I'll crash.

38:35.771 --> 38:36.647
Yeah.

38:37.398 --> 38:39.900
Put your seat belt on. And Will...

38:40.609 --> 38:41.569
don't overthink it.

38:41.986 --> 38:43.070
Go!

38:47.450 --> 38:48.659
We're not gonna make it!

38:55.541 --> 38:56.417
No thinking.

39:08.512 --> 39:10.264
- Pull!
-Pull!

39:10.348 --> 39:11.766
Pull!

39:11.849 --> 39:14.185
Pull! Pull!

39:23.402 --> 39:26.614
- Oh!

39:26.697 --> 39:28.866
That's the power of teamwork.

39:28.949 --> 39:30.951
You do know how to sail!

39:31.243 --> 39:33.079
Sometimes I actually tell the truth.

39:40.211 --> 39:43.005
Hey, Will! You okay? What happened?

39:45.424 --> 39:46.342
I gave it gas.

39:47.927 --> 39:50.054
Come on.

39:51.222 --> 39:52.181
Judy!

39:52.306 --> 39:55.476
-That's sailing. Good job.

39:58.312 --> 39:59.355
Are you okay?

39:59.730 --> 40:00.815
Lungs'll heal.

40:01.774 --> 40:02.900
My legs are tired.

40:02.983 --> 40:04.151
And my arms are tired.

40:04.360 --> 40:07.780
And there are parts of my body that I was
previously unaware of that are very tired.

40:07.863 --> 40:10.616
Well, you did good.

40:10.699 --> 40:12.034
Yeah, 'cause you were there.

40:12.118 --> 40:15.079
I'm happy to report
that I've repaired Ceedra.

40:15.162 --> 40:17.289
-That's right, Judy, I am amazing.

40:17.373 --> 40:19.917
And in an evident karmic exchange,

40:20.042 --> 40:23.379
this space ghost over here
trashed the Chariot.

40:25.965 --> 40:26.799
Nice work.

40:27.299 --> 40:28.259
Thanks.

40:28.717 --> 40:31.220
Wow! Let's all remember this moment,
you know,

40:31.303 --> 40:33.305
-in case she wants to yell at me again.

40:37.893 --> 40:39.395
I've secured the deck.

40:47.278 --> 40:48.237
Okay.

41:14.889 --> 41:16.765
I know what you're thinking, Maureen.

41:17.850 --> 41:19.685
How could I have gotten these burns?

41:20.644 --> 41:24.106
What if the greenhouse contamination
wasn't an accident?

41:25.065 --> 41:28.402
What if someone peeled off the patch
on purpose?

41:31.322 --> 41:33.532
But if that were even possible,
it would mean

41:33.908 --> 41:37.661
for the last seven months
I wasn't as locked up as you thought.

41:37.745 --> 41:39.663
Maybe someone like me,

41:39.955 --> 41:41.790
who's been incarcerated a few times,

41:41.874 --> 41:43.876
would be able to break out;

41:44.710 --> 41:46.253
come and go as I please

41:46.754 --> 41:48.339
and you would never know.

41:50.674 --> 41:53.219
If any of that were true,
you'd owe me, Maureen.

41:54.637 --> 41:56.597
We've gotten everything we both wanted.

41:59.016 --> 42:01.685
John was never gonna leave
that dirty scrap of land.

42:02.728 --> 42:03.979
Because I was the bad guy

42:04.522 --> 42:05.898
you didn't have to be.

42:09.652 --> 42:12.071
Not much point in locking me up anymore.

42:15.908 --> 42:17.326
Please, let me help.

42:17.409 --> 42:20.162
I've been freeloading for months
eating your delicious homegrown food.

42:20.996 --> 42:22.831
So, what, now she's part of the family?

42:22.915 --> 42:23.832
Less work for me.

42:24.917 --> 42:27.336
Yeah? You'd better watch yourself.

42:27.461 --> 42:29.129
I don't want trouble.

42:45.104 --> 42:46.230
Okay.

43:18.554 --> 43:19.972
So I learned how to drive.

43:22.224 --> 43:25.394
And today, for the first time,
I drove by myself.

43:28.606 --> 43:29.648
I crashed.

43:33.277 --> 43:35.404
I wish you'd been there to see it.

43:40.784 --> 43:43.287
Everyone thinks the only reason I miss you

43:44.538 --> 43:46.540
is because you help us out of trouble...

43:48.626 --> 43:50.085
but we do okay on our own.

43:52.254 --> 43:54.173
I just miss you 'cause we're friends.

43:56.884 --> 44:00.512
So, the whole reason
I was crashing the Chariot

44:01.138 --> 44:03.599
is because we've been sailing
across the ocean...

44:04.391 --> 44:05.392
in the Jupiter...

44:06.852 --> 44:10.481
with sails, real sails,
if you can believe it.

44:12.149 --> 44:14.485
Me, Judy and Penny
made a pretty good crew...

44:16.028 --> 44:19.990
until it was just me and Judy
because Penny was too busy throwing up.

44:23.744 --> 44:24.787
We made it, babe.

44:27.331 --> 44:29.541
Pretty soon,
we're gonna be off this planet.

44:31.585 --> 44:33.045
I didn't want it all to end.

44:35.089 --> 44:37.216
We're surrounded by water
we can't drink

44:37.299 --> 44:38.676
and air we can't breathe.

44:39.635 --> 44:41.178
But we made our home here.

44:42.680 --> 44:44.682
Finally, we were all together again.

44:47.518 --> 44:48.727
We're still together.

44:49.937 --> 44:50.771
Wait.

44:52.022 --> 44:53.023
Do you see that?

44:53.107 --> 44:54.149
What is that?

44:55.275 --> 44:56.652
Are those more shoals?

44:58.028 --> 44:59.655
- I don't like this.

45:01.156 --> 45:03.742
We're caught in the current.
We've gotta slow down.

45:06.120 --> 45:07.621
What are we looking at?

45:12.376 --> 45:13.919
Is that a waterfall?

45:15.045 --> 45:15.879
Go!

45:15.963 --> 45:18.674
Go, go, go, go, go. Come on,
come on, come on! Strap in!

45:18.757 --> 45:20.050
- Hurry!

45:22.970 --> 45:24.179
Will, come on!

45:24.263 --> 45:26.849
Can we just get where we're going
once without crashing?

45:28.892 --> 45:31.228
Everyone, hold on. We're going over.

45:32.688 --> 45:33.856
I love you guys.

45:40.320 --> 45:42.823
Okay. Hey, Penny?
Penny, Will, are you okay?

45:42.906 --> 45:43.991
Yeah. Yeah.

45:44.074 --> 45:46.368
-Okay, we're good, right?
- Belts off. We gotta go.

45:46.452 --> 45:50.038
- Yeah.
- Mom? Dad?

46:09.641 --> 46:10.476
Well...

46:11.310 --> 46:12.352
we're here.

46:12.436 --> 46:14.104
That looks like metal down there.

46:14.188 --> 46:16.356
That's too straight.
That can't be natural.

46:16.440 --> 46:17.441
No.

46:18.066 --> 46:19.193
Somebody built this.

46:21.069 --> 46:22.154
Who?
