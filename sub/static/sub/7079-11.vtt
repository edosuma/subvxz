That was insane.

01:43.061 --> 01:44.229
I'm 50 here.

01:44.521 --> 01:46.001
I mean, I think
I could win this year.

01:46.064 --> 01:47.649
I think I could go all the way.

01:47.941 --> 01:51.153
Actually,
you'll be settling for silver.

02:27.189 --> 02:30.192
Names. You give me names or
you're expelled. That simple.

02:30.484 --> 02:33.570
I told you. I don't know nothing
about no secret paintball games.

02:33.862 --> 02:36.156
This is from huffing paint,
I swear.

Escort Alex Osbourne off campus.

02:38.033 --> 02:40.619
Hey, hey, hey.
Hold your horse panties.

02:40.911 --> 02:42.496
You didn't tell me
you know my name.

02:42.788 --> 02:45.582
Look, I was about to take Todd
out, and then we both got shot.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.292
Guy was invisible.

02:47.584 --> 02:48.585
A ghost.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.253
Uses silver paint.

02:50.545 --> 02:52.005
A ghost? So, no name?

02:52.297 --> 02:54.097
I'd call him Silver Ghost,
but that's probably

02:54.216 --> 02:55.616
already taken by
an indie comic book

02:55.842 --> 02:56.968
or a terrible tequila.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.804
Bye forever, Starburns.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.096
No, no.

03:00.305 --> 03:01.848
No, no, no, no. Frankie?

03:02.140 --> 03:03.809
Dean, I respect
that you are my boss,

03:04.101 --> 03:05.769
so either fire me
or let me handle this,

03:06.061 --> 03:07.229
and go to your office.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.692
I want to give your paintball
friends a message, Jeff.

03:11.983 --> 03:14.069
Good morning. This era is over.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.281
It was fun while it lasted,
but now mommy's home.

03:16.571 --> 03:19.783
Everybody with a gun will be
expelled or fired.

03:20.075 --> 03:22.679
Don't worry, Ms. Dart. My boys and I
will get this cleaned up in no time.

03:22.703 --> 03:25.288
Thank you. Jeff, do you
know deputy custodian Lapari?

03:25.580 --> 03:26.998
Oh, we haven't had the pleasure,

03:27.290 --> 03:29.602
because Mr. Winger has caused me
nothing but pain over the years

03:29.626 --> 03:30.794
with his paintballing.

03:31.086 --> 03:32.796
I'm sorry. I quit that.
That's behind me.

03:33.088 --> 03:34.297
Sure it is.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.300
Handling turds has
rubbed off on him.

03:37.592 --> 03:40.178
Custodian Lapari is gonna
be honored this week

03:40.470 --> 03:41.870
at the Gala for
a Cleaner Greendale.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.140
I'd like you to introduce him.

03:43.432 --> 03:45.284
Why would I do that? Because
you're the de facto

03:45.308 --> 03:47.068
leader of Greendale,
and if you gave a speech

03:47.185 --> 03:49.146
coming out against paintball,
it might end it.

03:49.438 --> 03:51.231
No, no.
Just because I'm not playing

03:51.523 --> 03:53.603
doesn't mean I'm the weenie
that tells people not to.

03:54.693 --> 03:55.819
Please?

03:56.111 --> 03:57.738
If not for Greendale,
then for me?

04:01.742 --> 04:03.034
I'll think about it.

04:06.580 --> 04:07.820
Like a different guy back then.

04:07.914 --> 04:08.994
Yeah, mmm. Two, never mind.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.500
Well, Frankie's upset.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.270
Did she break up with someone?
Which gender?

04:12.294 --> 04:14.129
I don't care,
but everybody else does.

04:14.421 --> 04:15.756
She's upset about paintball.

04:16.380 --> 04:18.632
Paint? Ball?

04:18.925 --> 04:20.125
Occasionally our campus erupts

04:20.177 --> 04:21.511
into a flawless
post-modern homage

04:21.803 --> 04:24.243
to action-adventure mythology
mischaracterized by the ignorant

04:24.431 --> 04:25.807
as parody.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.643
Apparently, now that Frankie's
declared it illegal,

04:28.935 --> 04:31.289
it's gone underground, and it's
still happening as we speak.

04:31.313 --> 04:32.606
Well, maybe for freshmen,

04:32.898 --> 04:34.938
but honestly, we've kind
of done it to death, right?

04:35.025 --> 04:36.193
Done it. Nailed it.

04:36.485 --> 04:38.528
I won a few times, now.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.140
No, who keeps track of that.
Lame.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.907
I'm thinking mostly
about Frankie.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.493
She's our friend, and she
cares about this school,

04:44.785 --> 04:46.179
and I think
it would break her heart

04:46.203 --> 04:48.538
if she caught any of us
undermining her goals.

04:48.830 --> 04:49.831
Yes. Yeah, agreed.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.517
A reasonable agreement.
No paint and balls.

04:51.541 --> 04:53.126
Well, meeting adjourned,
I guess.

04:53.418 --> 04:54.418
This is good.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.171
I'm glad we all agree
not to do this.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.715
It's gonna make it a lot
easier for me to beat you.

05:01.259 --> 05:02.260
What the hell?

05:03.637 --> 05:04.763
They killed me!

05:05.639 --> 05:06.639
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:06.807 --> 05:07.808
Don't do anything stupid.

05:08.099 --> 05:09.099
Do something stupid.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.427
I thought we weren't playing.

05:10.685 --> 05:11.954
Is this an alliance?
I don't know, is it?

05:11.978 --> 05:13.247
What's paintball?
Cut the crap, Elroy.

05:13.271 --> 05:14.481
Stop that. What are you doing?

05:14.773 --> 05:16.441
Aah! Go back to class.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.693
Jeff Winger's playing paintball.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.362
- No, he's not!
- Think about it,

05:20.654 --> 05:22.173
or don't think about it,
but don't do it.

05:22.197 --> 05:23.197
Don't even.

05:32.582 --> 05:33.667
Grow up.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.797
What are you doing?
I'm not playing.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.567
For a guy who's not playing, you sure
are shooting a bunch of mothers.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.718
That was instinct.
I can't help being a badass,

05:44.010 --> 05:45.387
but I am not playing.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.514
Okay, so
let's make this painless.

05:47.806 --> 05:49.006
Take it easy. Leave her alone.

05:49.266 --> 05:50.475
Drop it. Knock it off.

05:50.767 --> 05:51.767
Frankie is coming.

05:51.893 --> 05:53.173
What is important to you people?

05:56.106 --> 05:58.358
Jeff Winger shot me!

06:00.819 --> 06:03.029
Do I use echo-location
to navigate?

06:03.321 --> 06:05.174
Why would you guess that, after
learning you're not a bat?

06:05.198 --> 06:06.198
Hello.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.993
Hi, Frankie. Frankie.

06:08.285 --> 06:10.245
Jeff.
A student just passed by me

06:10.537 --> 06:12.330
and said you shot him
with paint.

06:13.623 --> 06:15.625
Uh, okay.

06:15.917 --> 06:19.254
So you are definitely
not playing paintball?

06:19.546 --> 06:20.546
- No...
- Frankie,

06:20.755 --> 06:22.007
I've been cool up until now,

06:22.299 --> 06:23.943
but I gotta tell you,
I'm starting to get offended

06:23.967 --> 06:25.468
by your suspicion about this.
Well...

06:25.760 --> 06:27.680
Well is a hole in the ground
when you're thirsty.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.688
I'm telling you,
I ain't playing no paintball.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.099
Hee-haw. Bam!

06:32.017 --> 06:35.312
Okay, take it easy, guys.

06:35.604 --> 06:38.440
And for what it's worth, thank you
for teaching me the cool new way

06:38.732 --> 06:40.775
to respond to people
saying the word "well."

06:42.444 --> 06:43.904
All right, guys. Bye, Franks.

06:44.195 --> 06:45.595
Bye, Frankie.
See you. Take it easy.

06:45.864 --> 06:46.907
See ya.

06:49.034 --> 06:50.368
Will you stop doing that?

06:50.660 --> 06:51.660
Don't hate the player.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.455
Colloquialisms aside,
Annie's right.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.499
The thing to hate this year
is the game.

06:56.791 --> 06:57.951
Can I show you all something?

07:00.003 --> 07:01.480
You know this game
is being run anonymously

07:01.504 --> 07:03.224
through an online server,
but who set it up?

07:03.423 --> 07:05.192
They haven't left a clue,
which is a really big clue,

07:05.216 --> 07:06.569
because if they're this good
at anything...

07:06.593 --> 07:08.011
Why are they here?

07:08.303 --> 07:09.463
Whoever's running this server

07:09.638 --> 07:11.358
is offering a huge cash prize
to the winner.

07:11.514 --> 07:12.849
More evidence
they don't go here,

07:13.141 --> 07:15.021
and they seem to have
their own man in the game.

07:15.226 --> 07:16.913
You've probably heard
about a mysterious player

07:16.937 --> 07:18.521
using silver paintballs.

07:18.813 --> 07:20.482
Well, look
at these IP addresses.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.192
If that means
what I think it means,

07:22.484 --> 07:23.902
we're dealing with gibberish.

07:24.194 --> 07:25.320
Those are mine.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.173
That's a student
or teacher on this campus

07:27.197 --> 07:29.157
opening an encrypted tunnel
to an off-campus site.

07:29.366 --> 07:30.646
Big deal.
I do that all the time.

07:30.742 --> 07:32.302
Oh, I save it all up
for Saturday night.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.692
You're right. It's no big deal,

07:33.954 --> 07:35.556
unless you always do it
immediately before a paintball

07:35.580 --> 07:37.780
player is taken out with
premium-grade silver paintballs

07:37.958 --> 07:39.501
by an unknown shooter,

07:39.793 --> 07:42.313
and unless the IP address that
you're connecting to is this one.

07:43.380 --> 07:44.673
Of course.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.325
So who's
the silver paintballs guy?

07:46.591 --> 07:48.468
Spy, assassin, mercenary,

07:48.760 --> 07:51.304
bad person walking among us,
laughing, laughing quietly.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.908
And then if we look, pretending that
he was looking at something funny.

07:53.932 --> 07:55.934
I suppose
you all should be in trouble.

07:57.811 --> 07:58.895
But desperate Deans...

08:00.021 --> 08:01.106
But...

08:02.440 --> 08:03.942
But desperate...

08:07.028 --> 08:08.279
But des...

08:11.366 --> 08:13.952
But desperate Deans call
for Deansperate measures.

08:14.244 --> 08:16.746
From here on out,
you work for me.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.352
Everything you're saying
just proves my point,

08:21.376 --> 08:23.962
that the only way to lose
this game is to play it,

08:24.254 --> 08:26.214
and I say we do the honest
thing and tell Frankie.

08:26.464 --> 08:27.817
The school's playing
and losing already,

08:27.841 --> 08:28.842
Frankie included.

08:29.134 --> 08:30.653
If the people
in this room play to win,

08:30.677 --> 08:32.071
we could not only take
City College's money,

08:32.095 --> 08:33.722
we can expose Silverballs and,

08:34.014 --> 08:35.974
in turn, City College,
and save Greendale.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.586
Which is basically saving
Frankie.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.184
All right, so we lay low,

08:39.477 --> 08:41.116
and we try to find out
who Silverballs is.

08:41.312 --> 08:43.565
But we're not, to be clear,
we did not vote on that name.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.109
Here's a name
you don't have to vote on.

08:46.401 --> 08:48.695
You just became
the Secret Dean Force.

08:48.987 --> 08:50.822
The Dean Boys. Taskforce Dean.

08:51.114 --> 08:53.575
His Dean's Secret People. I
know the word "Dean" is in it.

08:53.867 --> 08:54.987
Because when the politicians

08:55.201 --> 08:56.661
fail and the peace talks
fall apart,

08:56.953 --> 08:59.748
when it seems like all is lost

09:00.040 --> 09:02.459
and nobody really
needs the Dean anymore,

09:02.751 --> 09:04.836
because Frankie's here,

09:05.128 --> 09:06.379
that's when you go in.

09:06.671 --> 09:10.175
The last bastion of a bygone
era when people respected me.

09:16.014 --> 09:18.099
Dean Force... One.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.373
If you're gonna hang around,
we could use some waters.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.398
On it.

09:31.112 --> 09:32.280
Club Club.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.199
The last club
I thought I'd ever join.

09:34.491 --> 09:36.785
Your target is a small-time
paintball munitions dealer.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.677
All we know is
he's a white male over 30,

09:38.953 --> 09:40.663
and his street name is Fun Dad.

09:42.165 --> 09:43.666
All right,
is everybody in this club

09:43.958 --> 09:45.585
ready to party the way
they do in clubs?

09:45.877 --> 09:46.920
Whoo!

09:49.589 --> 09:52.217
Connor, stop horsing around
with Billy and party.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.269
The DJ might be the guy
from Meow-Meow-Beenz.

09:54.552 --> 09:55.887
We need clean
intelligence, Abed.

09:56.179 --> 09:57.722
No references. No callbacks.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.225
Excuse me, my good sir,
if I could have the mic?

10:00.517 --> 10:01.726
Attention shoppers,

10:02.018 --> 10:05.605
there is a sale on partying
in my pants aisle.

10:05.897 --> 10:07.148
Everything in my pants must go.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.793
Well, not everything.
That doesn't...

10:08.817 --> 10:10.110
You know what I...

10:10.401 --> 10:12.487
Koogler? Aladdin.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.155
I thought your name was Fun Dad.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.491
No. That was easy.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.159
I need ammunition.
Are you a narc?

10:18.451 --> 10:19.744
Why would I answer
that honestly?

10:20.036 --> 10:22.330
Good point. That's how
most people answer, so...

10:22.622 --> 10:24.767
Yeah, come on. It's a bad question.
Just get so many narcs.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.352
Hey, don't forget.
There's a signup sheet

10:26.376 --> 10:28.753
on the back wall
for Club-Club-Club.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.589
Listen, I'm so glad, Omar, that
you're interested in paintball.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.758
Now, I have to tell you,
no shooting in here.

10:34.050 --> 10:36.886
The first rule of Club Club is
that we are not a fight club.

10:37.178 --> 10:39.055
The second rule is that
if you're a hot lady,

10:39.347 --> 10:41.266
you have to have sex with me.

10:41.558 --> 10:43.285
And then there's a bunch
of rules and restrictions

10:43.309 --> 10:44.629
that they've just now
been adding,

10:44.853 --> 10:47.856
because of the lawsuits
based on that second rule,

10:48.148 --> 10:49.588
which I'm not allowed
to call a rule.

10:49.858 --> 10:51.836
That was my screw-up. Let me
show you what I got here.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.820
All right.
These are blue travelers.

10:54.112 --> 10:57.949
I think I've got some sarcastic
mellow yellows in here.

10:58.241 --> 10:59.534
Those are great.

10:59.826 --> 11:00.946
And these are green meanies.

11:01.119 --> 11:02.119
They explode on contact,

11:02.370 --> 11:04.289
and they mark your target
with paint.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.141
That's a description
of every paintball.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.625
Okay, so you know your stuff.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.228
Why don't I give you
a pro discount?

11:09.252 --> 11:11.171
I'm thinking
something more exotic.

11:11.462 --> 11:13.047
Something in silver?

11:15.466 --> 11:17.218
Yeah.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.590
Okay, great. I think that's a great idea.
You know...

11:25.643 --> 11:28.438
You want to stay
in the game? Talk.

11:28.730 --> 11:29.856
Okay, look.

11:30.148 --> 11:31.649
If you're a narc,
you can't play.

11:31.941 --> 11:37.197
And if you're playing,
I do accept sex for ammo.

11:37.488 --> 11:40.658
Or beer, right, but not Bitcoin.
I mean I believe in it.

11:40.950 --> 11:42.950
I just, I think I feel
like I need it to stabilize.

11:43.203 --> 11:46.581
Who is silver... man?

11:46.873 --> 11:48.750
My accountant?
Well, how do you know David?

11:49.042 --> 11:50.882
You know what I mean.
Who buys the silver ammo?

11:51.169 --> 11:55.173
Oh, look, if I tell you that,
I'm pretendsies dead, right?

12:06.267 --> 12:07.602
Koogler? They got him.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.355
That's good.

12:10.647 --> 12:12.482
Then he won't be needing this.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.194
Koogler's thumb drive
is actually

12:16.486 --> 12:17.570
a hardware encryption key.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.490
Hmm. Can it be un-encrypted?

12:20.782 --> 12:22.742
No, you use it to decrypt
something encrypted.

12:23.034 --> 12:24.577
A key with a lock on it.

12:24.869 --> 12:27.956
I'll give our enemy this.
They're clever.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.083
Why did they pair us together?

12:30.375 --> 12:33.253
Look, a message chain between
Koogler and Silverballs.

12:33.544 --> 12:35.922
Now, he's ordering a huge
batch of ammo and stressing

12:36.214 --> 12:38.675
that he needs it before
the Cleaner Greendale Gala.

12:38.967 --> 12:41.261
- City College is...
- Oh!

12:41.552 --> 12:44.472
City College is going to
crash Frankie's gala.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.934
And here's where Silverballs
decides on silver balls.

12:48.226 --> 12:50.186
"Which color will look coolest"

12:50.478 --> 12:52.313
"against a navy blue jumpsuit?"

12:52.605 --> 12:54.816
Who wears a jumpsuit
to a black tie gala?

12:56.985 --> 12:58.611
The guest of honor.

12:59.570 --> 13:00.863
Is your Internet not working?

13:01.155 --> 13:03.825
It's one photo.
It's taking an hour.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.286
You have keystrokes
programmed to... eesh.

13:06.577 --> 13:08.496
That's dorky.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.456
Looks like we'll be renting
formalwear.

13:10.748 --> 13:11.748
I'll measure Jeffrey.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.923
Mr. Winger, you clean up nice.

13:19.215 --> 13:20.758
Oh, come on.
I'm always good-looking.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.803
This seems ambitious.

13:24.095 --> 13:27.056
Well, the monorail is
more symbolic of our potential

13:27.348 --> 13:28.516
than it is potential,

13:28.808 --> 13:30.995
and none of our buildings
will ever be shaped like this,

13:31.019 --> 13:33.688
but with a little work,
this is how we could feel.

13:34.605 --> 13:36.357
You should be proud.

13:36.649 --> 13:39.235
Thank you, Jeff,
for supporting this.

13:41.029 --> 13:42.739
Why is that in your ear?

13:43.031 --> 13:45.950
Oh, I'm raising awareness of
Armenian-American stereotypes.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.161
Bale to belfry. Let's check in.

13:48.453 --> 13:52.165
Should stereotypes
have their awareness raised?

13:52.457 --> 13:54.042
I... Oh, good Lord.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.614
I am questioning you again. Why?

13:57.128 --> 14:00.340
Follow your bliss, sir.
You've earned it.

14:00.631 --> 14:02.351
Keaton to belfry.
I need us all to make sure

14:02.383 --> 14:04.052
we are very, very careful here.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.946
Bale to Keaton. Why don't
you set a good example

14:05.970 --> 14:08.222
by keeping your mind
on the mission...

14:08.514 --> 14:09.766
And your eyes on the prize.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.186
Prize is secure. Keaton out.

14:14.437 --> 14:16.481
West to belfry.
Entrance is secure.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.191
Keaton to Kilmer. Status.

14:18.483 --> 14:19.817
Kilmer to belfry.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.389
I'm currently examining a spoon,

14:21.652 --> 14:23.237
only I'm not
really examining it.

14:23.529 --> 14:27.283
I'm using it as cover while watching
a somewhat suspicious waiter.

14:27.575 --> 14:29.055
The voice of
Diedrich Bader to belfry.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.202
I've checked the custodial
wing for the third time.

14:31.287 --> 14:32.622
Can I come join the mission now?

14:32.914 --> 14:34.234
Negative, voice of
Diedrich Bader.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.209
Continue to check
the custodial wing,

14:36.501 --> 14:38.687
and then check the perimeter
of the inside of your office.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.171
Okay.

14:42.131 --> 14:44.550
And for the record, I feel
very vulnerable without a gun.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.513
Ugh, is that the only song
that plays in this thing?

14:50.515 --> 14:51.808
Hey there, Dean.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.184
Need a custodian?

14:54.769 --> 14:55.769
Dean.

14:55.978 --> 14:57.188
Dean.

14:57.480 --> 14:58.480
Dean.

14:58.648 --> 14:59.648
Dean.

15:11.369 --> 15:13.788
Clooney to belfry. I've
got a bogey with a gun.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.456
Excuse me?

15:15.748 --> 15:16.791
I wasn't talking to you.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.167
I was ordering dinner.

15:18.459 --> 15:21.504
Yes, uh, hello, can I
get a bogey with a gun?

15:21.796 --> 15:25.383
No pickles,
and three orders of gun.

15:27.009 --> 15:28.428
Damn it.
Clooney slopped the bogey,

15:28.719 --> 15:30.179
and now he's headed
for the kitchen.

15:32.807 --> 15:34.058
Should we go? Negative.

15:34.350 --> 15:35.430
We don't know it's our man.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.186
Kilmer, Clooney, do nothing

15:37.478 --> 15:39.188
unless you can do it
quietly and calmly.

15:40.773 --> 15:41.773
What the hell?

15:42.024 --> 15:43.024
Nothing.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.944
Are you ready? Yes.

15:47.238 --> 15:48.781
Clooney to Kilmer. What?

15:49.073 --> 15:50.073
Should I come in now?

15:50.241 --> 15:52.827
No. No, you can't ever
come in, ever.

15:53.119 --> 15:54.787
You're sloppy. Excuse me.

15:55.079 --> 15:56.289
Can I have a word with you?

15:56.581 --> 15:57.748
About what?

16:00.334 --> 16:02.378
Well, there's been some reports

16:02.670 --> 16:04.589
about a paintball game
on campus?

16:04.881 --> 16:07.258
Oh, yeah. You better believe
the kitchen boys are playing.

16:07.550 --> 16:09.385
And this year, we got a
new winning strategy.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.305
Let the idiots come to you.

16:12.597 --> 16:14.182
Oh, really?

16:16.100 --> 16:18.311
Oh, Britta, you can come in now.

16:26.277 --> 16:27.445
Pow! Pow!

16:42.418 --> 16:43.628
Oh! Aah! I'm sorry.

16:55.932 --> 16:59.352
I stand before you, one of
Greendale's biggest perpetrators

16:59.644 --> 17:01.312
of paint-related mayhem,

17:01.604 --> 17:03.189
and I am happy to say
that those days

17:03.481 --> 17:05.358
are fully behind our school.

17:05.650 --> 17:07.276
Looking back on those dark days,

17:07.568 --> 17:09.153
it's clear that the only heroes

17:09.444 --> 17:11.239
were the janitors
and the custodians

17:11.531 --> 17:12.990
left to clean up our messes.

17:21.374 --> 17:22.458
Ow! Ow!

17:22.750 --> 17:23.792
Stop! Ow!

17:31.717 --> 17:34.887
So, it is with great shame
and poetic irony

17:35.179 --> 17:38.474
that I present
the custodial innovation award

17:38.766 --> 17:40.601
to Vice Custodian Lapari.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.624
What the hell
are you doing in there?

17:45.648 --> 17:47.024
Jeff, focus. You all right, man?

17:47.316 --> 17:48.776
- Yes.
- It wasn't our guy.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.653
The assassin
is not in the kitchen.

17:50.945 --> 17:52.446
He's still at large.

17:52.738 --> 17:56.117
And now, let's all enact
what I hope will become

17:56.409 --> 17:59.120
a yearly tradition,
the popping of the balloons.

17:59.787 --> 18:00.787
What?

18:00.997 --> 18:01.997
Oh!

18:02.081 --> 18:03.124
And... oh!

18:07.128 --> 18:08.248
Stay calm. Check your zones.

18:12.508 --> 18:13.968
Who's that? Where?

18:14.260 --> 18:15.928
Where? I don't see anything.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.220
There!

18:38.618 --> 18:39.618
Oh!

18:42.371 --> 18:43.497
I'm sorry.

18:54.634 --> 18:55.760
It's the custodians!

18:56.052 --> 18:57.428
Greendale's custodial staff

18:57.720 --> 19:00.222
is running the underground
paintball tournament.

19:00.514 --> 19:02.892
Probably with City College
money.

19:03.184 --> 19:05.853
The people that clean Greendale
don't want a cleaner Greendale.

19:06.145 --> 19:09.732
They want Greendale to be afraid
of itself and reliant on them.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.362
Oh, what an exciting story.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.906
We've got a real-life
M. Night Shamalyan here.

19:17.198 --> 19:18.658
It's "Shyamalan." Unfortunately,

19:18.949 --> 19:20.493
as with his stories,

19:20.785 --> 19:22.662
I don't anticipate
yours holding up.

19:22.953 --> 19:23.953
Easy target.

19:24.205 --> 19:25.665
Who's heckling me?

19:25.956 --> 19:27.316
Oh, of course.
It's the Indian guy.

19:27.541 --> 19:30.461
I'm Arabic. Oh... kay.

19:30.753 --> 19:32.546
Let's go with that.

19:32.838 --> 19:35.257
Anyway, you know what goes
great with crazy stories?

19:35.549 --> 19:37.593
Evidence. You're the evidence.

19:37.885 --> 19:39.762
Come back to our side
and tell the truth

19:40.054 --> 19:41.681
so City College can be exposed.

19:41.972 --> 19:44.350
Or I could leave and get a job
at City College

19:44.642 --> 19:46.644
where their payphones
aren't only herpe-free,

19:46.936 --> 19:48.521
they're actually removed.

19:48.813 --> 19:50.207
Do you think City College
will take you

19:50.231 --> 19:51.791
if you lose
their paintball prize money?

19:52.692 --> 19:54.819
I don't know how many men
you have left in your game,

19:55.111 --> 19:56.737
but if you're leaving this room,

19:57.029 --> 19:58.572
it needs to be a small army.

20:03.577 --> 20:04.829
Okay.

20:05.121 --> 20:06.121
I agree.

20:15.923 --> 20:16.924
No!

20:19.802 --> 20:21.387
Jeremy, look out!

20:33.816 --> 20:34.859
Oh.

20:35.818 --> 20:36.902
Aah!

20:45.953 --> 20:46.954
No!

20:56.714 --> 20:57.882
Damn it.

20:59.967 --> 21:01.093
We're the last ones left.

21:01.385 --> 21:02.385
Cover me.

21:02.553 --> 21:03.637
Dreams do come true.

21:10.436 --> 21:12.354
Okay, we got him.
He went into a supply closet.

21:12.646 --> 21:14.023
I know. I guess, to a custodian,

21:14.315 --> 21:15.675
a supply closet
is like a location.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.593
I'm actually relieved. I thought
this was gonna be a whole gauntlet,

21:24.617 --> 21:25.868
and my heart was not in it.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.453
I mean, I shot a disabled kid.

21:27.745 --> 21:30.456
I can't do this anymore.
What are you looking at?

21:30.748 --> 21:32.374
This isn't a closet.

21:46.013 --> 21:48.224
Oh, it's really nice
of you guys to visit.

21:48.516 --> 21:50.516
Not that you ever would have
done it intentionally.

21:53.062 --> 21:55.022
Your steamy pipes can't stop us.

21:55.314 --> 21:58.359
Well, it would be a pretty
bad museum exhibit if they could.

21:59.652 --> 22:00.778
Give it up, Lapari.

22:01.070 --> 22:02.655
Hey, Dean. I have a microphone.

22:02.947 --> 22:04.657
You have a beer. God has a plan.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.327
I have a beer?

22:08.619 --> 22:11.019
It's an old stand-up line for
using on hecklers. Keep moving.

22:11.831 --> 22:13.958
Did you do stand-up?

22:14.250 --> 22:16.460
Is that how you
became a custodian?

22:16.752 --> 22:19.672
Listen, man.
I was there in the '90s.

22:19.964 --> 22:21.924
I did a few open mic nights.

22:23.133 --> 22:24.844
Saw what karaoke did.

22:26.595 --> 22:27.972
It wasn't cool, man.

22:28.264 --> 22:30.891
We're not so
different, you and I, Dean.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.519
Don't you see we're
both in the same situation?

22:35.354 --> 22:36.814
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

22:39.483 --> 22:40.693
Screw it. Shoot 'em all.

22:40.985 --> 22:42.665
One of them is him.
Shoot every single one.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.912
He's not back here.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.706
Okay. Reload.

22:53.998 --> 22:57.126
There must be a mop jousting
bridge over a sawdust canyon.

22:57.418 --> 23:00.921
We're both dinosaurs
roaring in vain at the mammals.

23:01.213 --> 23:02.357
What did you think
was gonna happen

23:02.381 --> 23:04.925
when you let Frankie Dart
into our world?

23:05.217 --> 23:08.512
How much more clean can she make
the school before she notices

23:08.804 --> 23:10.639
the dirtiest thing of all
about it?

23:11.724 --> 23:14.059
You think I'm a villain,
but I'm not.

23:14.351 --> 23:18.272
I'm defending a place where we
all get to be our own heroes.

23:18.564 --> 23:20.941
We're all here because...

23:21.233 --> 23:22.818
None of us can have nice things.

23:23.110 --> 23:25.946
Aah! I thought you guys
were mannequins!

23:26.238 --> 23:27.489
What a backfire.

23:27.781 --> 23:29.241
Is the money real?

23:29.533 --> 23:30.534
No matter who wins?

23:31.702 --> 23:32.703
Dean, what are you doing?

23:34.371 --> 23:35.664
What are you thinking about?

23:35.956 --> 23:37.458
I don't know, I don't know!

23:37.750 --> 23:38.959
He's right, Jeffrey.

23:39.251 --> 23:42.087
A cleaner Greendale is like
a healthier cigarette.

23:42.379 --> 23:43.422
Yes, a carrot stick.

23:43.714 --> 23:44.983
Frankie can make us
a carrot stick.

23:45.007 --> 23:46.007
We're tobacco!

23:46.175 --> 23:47.426
No, we are not tobacco.

23:47.718 --> 23:49.261
We are Robert Downey Jr.

23:49.553 --> 23:51.573
He was so high he was crawling
into people's windows.

23:51.597 --> 23:52.765
Now he's Iron Man.

23:53.057 --> 23:54.977
We self-destruct like this
because we'd rather be

23:55.184 --> 23:57.728
heroes and villains than
just kind of sucky people

23:58.020 --> 23:59.820
that need to work a lot
at getting less sucky.

23:59.897 --> 24:01.482
She will forgive us.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.233
Oh. I know her. I like her.

24:03.525 --> 24:05.527
And if she fires
either of you, I'll quit.

24:05.819 --> 24:07.655
She's not the enemy.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.114
She can help us.

24:09.406 --> 24:10.658
We just have to cool it.

24:13.410 --> 24:15.621
It's true what he said.

24:16.664 --> 24:18.874
If you guys lower your guns,

24:19.166 --> 24:21.585
I'm not gonna throw you a party,

24:21.877 --> 24:23.879
but I'm not gonna get
anyone fired, either.

24:31.512 --> 24:32.721
I'll see you Monday.

24:33.013 --> 24:34.014
Idiots.

24:38.894 --> 24:40.229
So, who wins? What do we...

24:40.521 --> 24:42.147
Okay. On the count of three,

24:42.439 --> 24:43.999
we're gonna shoot ourselves
in the foot.

24:47.569 --> 24:48.570
One.

24:50.572 --> 24:51.573
Two.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.458
Ow!

25:05.713 --> 25:07.297
I'll see you guys on Monday.

25:10.718 --> 25:12.886
And the Pope looks at
the giraffe and says,

25:13.178 --> 25:15.556
"I'm in the room."

25:15.848 --> 25:17.368
Sorry, I can't remember
the whole joke.

25:17.433 --> 25:19.810
That's okay. It sounds very
funny based on the last line.

25:20.102 --> 25:22.062
Frankie's gonna be here soon.
We should get ready.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.231
We're not seriously
still doing this, are we?

25:24.523 --> 25:26.025
We promised every day,
for a week.

25:26.316 --> 25:27.317
Do you want her to quit?

25:30.612 --> 25:32.322
Good morning, everyone.

25:35.826 --> 25:37.327
So, where did we leave off
last time?

25:37.619 --> 25:38.912
Mmm. Yes, sir?

25:40.247 --> 25:41.623
I like big trucks.

25:41.915 --> 25:43.542
I saw a fire truck today.

25:43.834 --> 25:45.645
Interesting point. Would
anyone care to comment? Elroy?

25:45.669 --> 25:47.296
I made a stinky.

25:47.588 --> 25:49.089
Worth considering. Next item?

25:49.381 --> 25:50.661
How do you
pronounce "ba-sketty?"

25:50.841 --> 25:52.009
"Spaghetti." What else?

25:52.301 --> 25:53.301
Can we go to the zoo?

25:53.510 --> 25:55.345
Well, that raises
a very important point.

25:55.637 --> 25:56.930
We can do anything
we want, if...

25:57.222 --> 25:58.382
and this is very important...

25:58.599 --> 26:00.726
If we grow up. All in favor?

26:06.106 --> 26:08.426
Then she starts singing
about all of the places she's been,

26:08.525 --> 26:10.360
which by the way
seems to be a total of two.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.906
One of which is old D.C.

26:14.198 --> 26:17.034
Old D.C. Okay, fine, Vicki.

26:17.326 --> 26:19.870
You're a music major,
not a history major.

26:20.162 --> 26:22.372
And the whole mother thing.
I mean, the two big feathers

26:22.664 --> 26:24.917
in her cap are that she hasn't
let anything change her...

26:25.209 --> 26:28.670
A triumph she shares with
most animals and all dirt...

26:28.962 --> 26:30.964
And the fact
that her mother died,

26:31.256 --> 26:33.926
which is like, the one thing
all mothers do.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.714
I mean, was she a good mother?
Did she collect stamps?

26:37.763 --> 26:39.681
Did she race cars?
We don't know.

26:39.973 --> 26:41.826
We don't know her name.
I think if you ask Vicki

26:41.850 --> 26:43.090
the color of her mother's eyes,

26:43.143 --> 26:44.394
she would say "dead."

26:44.686 --> 26:46.855
Or maybe she'd say,
"$7.00 a seat."

26:48.690 --> 26:49.858
Damn, man. I am telling you,

26:50.150 --> 26:51.401
nobody is safe.

26:51.693 --> 26:53.070
Nobody is safe.

26:53.862 --> 26:54.863
Blue.

27:03.288 --> 27:05.290
They were a very pale shade
of blue.

27:07.876 --> 27:11.088
I'm sorry my show didn't
honor her memory properly.

27:11.380 --> 27:13.048
I'll try to make it up to you.

27:14.174 --> 27:17.302
Actually, we both will,

27:17.594 --> 27:20.097
at the premiere of our new show.

27:20.389 --> 27:22.057
Vicki and Garrett!

27:25.310 --> 27:27.563
And let's have a hand for
Vicki's mother, everybody.

27:27.855 --> 27:29.189
Stand up, Connie.
Vicki's mother.

27:29.481 --> 27:30.858
Vicki's mother.

27:34.862 --> 27:36.321
We'd rather you boo.

27:36.613 --> 27:37.948
It means you felt something.

27:38.240 --> 27:39.700
That's right. You can boo.

27:39.992 --> 27:41.827
Andy Kaufman loved booing.
Mmm-hmm.

27:44.705 --> 27:47.916
Then again, we did put a fair
share of work into this,

27:48.208 --> 27:49.918
but you don't have to be dicks.
