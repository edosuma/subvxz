01:19.244 --> 01:20.756
And heels down.

01:21.661 --> 01:22.980
This hurts.

01:22.981 --> 01:24.589
Pain is only in the mind.

01:24.590 --> 01:27.626
Right leg up, and flip your dog.

01:27.660 --> 01:29.027
It feels like my leg.

01:34.934 --> 01:38.303
Back to downward dog.

01:39.539 --> 01:41.606
My mind has a cramp.

01:42.160 --> 01:45.581
You know the guy that keeps
smiling at you... Jorge?

01:45.582 --> 01:47.693
He just broke up
with his girlfriend.

01:48.174 --> 01:48.743
Really?

01:48.744 --> 01:50.378
Mm-hmm. Double date tomorrow night.

01:50.412 --> 01:51.379
No!

01:51.413 --> 01:54.215
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!

01:54.249 --> 01:55.383
Sorry.

01:55.417 --> 01:57.085
What does he do? Medicine.

01:57.119 --> 01:58.620
Shh!

01:58.654 --> 02:00.588
Oh, all right.

02:02.491 --> 02:03.524
Rizzoli.

02:05.794 --> 02:07.395
Okay.

02:08.648 --> 02:09.781
Mindful awareness

02:09.816 --> 02:12.517
is what can subdue the
primitive consciousness

02:12.552 --> 02:16.655
and bring the physical body
under control of the will.

02:18.625 --> 02:20.092
I totally agree.

02:21.928 --> 02:22.761
I have to go.

02:22.762 --> 02:24.905
Yeah, you can't leave
before savasana.

02:25.314 --> 02:26.448
Corpse pose.

02:26.482 --> 02:29.163
Maura, let's go.

02:29.164 --> 02:30.819
Thank you.

02:35.763 --> 02:36.963
Namaste.

02:37.898 --> 02:39.132
Come on!

02:39.166 --> 02:41.167
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!

02:48.876 --> 02:49.961
Hey.Hey.

02:51.221 --> 02:52.458
You got her to do yoga.

02:52.459 --> 02:54.326
No, it was my idea. I love yoga.

02:54.360 --> 02:56.228
We had to leave before
ardha chandrasana.

02:56.262 --> 02:58.430
I feel very unbalanced.

02:59.532 --> 03:01.333
She was dragged here.

03:01.367 --> 03:03.402
Oh, that's all been
photographed and inventoried.

03:03.436 --> 03:06.438
Gaynor-Randle. 32.

03:08.441 --> 03:10.509
Atm $100. Scratch robbery.

03:10.543 --> 03:11.709
Did you find what was
used to beat her?

03:11.710 --> 03:12.859
Not yet.

03:16.182 --> 03:19.117
Vintage. She had a
flair for clothes.

03:19.152 --> 03:21.586
Hm, she was sexually assaulted.

03:21.621 --> 03:22.721
Reddish-brown stains

03:22.755 --> 03:24.523
on the inner thighs and
external genitalia.

03:24.557 --> 03:25.924
I hear an echo.

03:27.026 --> 03:28.527
She was married.

03:28.561 --> 03:30.562
Pager's totaled.

03:31.698 --> 03:33.465
It's not a pager.

03:33.499 --> 03:36.168
It's a glucose-management system -
Insulin pump.

03:36.202 --> 03:37.602
She was diabetic.

03:40.306 --> 03:41.506
Hm.

03:41.541 --> 03:44.342
Yep. Needle sticks.

03:44.377 --> 03:46.445
She probably had to
check her glucose level

03:46.479 --> 03:48.947
about 5 to 10 times a day.

03:48.981 --> 03:50.315
Maybe this.

03:54.287 --> 03:56.555
Yeah, she kept careful records.

03:56.589 --> 03:59.958
Her last glucose-level
reading was over 400.

03:59.992 --> 04:01.393
Is that good or bad?

04:01.427 --> 04:02.994
It's extremely high.

04:03.029 --> 04:05.363
Is that good or bad?

04:05.398 --> 04:07.466
Bad. She wasn't
getting any Insulin.

04:07.500 --> 04:10.702
She probably had slurred speech,
trouble walking.

04:10.737 --> 04:12.504
That explains why there's
no defensive wounds.

04:12.538 --> 04:13.638
She couldn't fight back.

04:13.673 --> 04:15.874
Murder weapon has a
rectangular edge on it.

04:15.908 --> 04:17.341
I can't confirm that.

04:17.375 --> 04:20.312
Hey, Frost,
we're looking for a 2x4...

04:23.282 --> 04:25.383
Frost, we're looking for an idiot.

04:25.418 --> 04:27.986
That your way of saying you
want to talk to the husband?

04:28.020 --> 04:29.321
What's it say about relationships

04:29.355 --> 04:31.223
that the husband or the
boyfriend's our first suspect?

04:31.257 --> 04:33.992
Are you getting ready for an
"I hate men" speech?

04:34.026 --> 04:36.528
I like men, just...
Not the ones that kill.

04:39.065 --> 04:40.132
Jane.

04:41.200 --> 04:43.235
It may not be the husband.

04:45.571 --> 04:48.340
Because she didn't have a husband.

04:51.644 --> 04:53.678
We're sorry for your loss,
Mrs. Randle.

04:53.713 --> 04:55.080
I prefer "mel."

04:55.114 --> 04:59.217
And it's gaynor-Randle.
We took each other's names.

04:59.252 --> 05:01.386
The commonwealth
recognizes our marriage.

05:01.420 --> 05:03.421
I have a right to
know who did this.

05:03.456 --> 05:05.924
Of course you do.
We want to know, too.

05:07.059 --> 05:09.828
When was the last
time you spoke to her?

05:09.862 --> 05:12.430
00, maybe?

05:12.465 --> 05:14.032
Did she always work late?

05:14.066 --> 05:16.968
Always... on my night out.

05:17.003 --> 05:20.605
I'm the, uh, captain of
the LGBT bowling league.

05:20.640 --> 05:23.275
Lesbian-gay- bisexual-transgender.

05:23.309 --> 05:25.143
Uh, what time did you get home?

05:25.178 --> 05:27.479
00.

05:28.119 --> 05:30.448
I called Katie's office, her cell.

05:31.751 --> 05:34.719
By midnight, I was calling
the E.R. and you guys

05:34.754 --> 05:36.888
over and over again.

05:36.923 --> 05:40.358
You can check with my alarm company,
my cell records...

05:41.494 --> 05:43.061
...The bowling alley.

05:43.095 --> 05:45.730
We will have to verify
your whereabouts.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.201
Understood.

05:50.303 --> 05:52.404
I suppose it's always
the first suspect.

06:07.687 --> 06:09.654
I'm sorry.

06:09.689 --> 06:11.590
That's okay.

06:18.531 --> 06:21.299
Oh, come on. It's not like she
has to worry about the scar.

06:21.334 --> 06:22.701
Don't rush me.

06:22.735 --> 06:25.136
Well, multitask, then.
Time of death?

06:25.171 --> 06:28.173
The core temperature I took
hepatically was 88.4 degrees.

06:30.042 --> 06:32.577
Killed between 2:00 and 3:00 A.M.

06:35.081 --> 06:36.481
Jorge say anything about me?

06:36.515 --> 06:37.549
Yoga Jorge?

06:37.583 --> 06:39.484
No, jaunty lube Jorge.

06:39.518 --> 06:41.186
Oil change? I don't go there.

06:41.220 --> 06:43.488
Total ripoff. Maura, come on.
What'd he say about me?

06:43.522 --> 06:45.357
He said, "sure."

06:46.659 --> 06:48.339
When Brock asked about
having a double date.

06:48.340 --> 06:50.962
No, I'm not going. Oh, Jane.

06:50.997 --> 06:52.898
What about DNA substance
from the sexual assault?

06:52.932 --> 06:56.534
No semen, but I did collect
some deerskin fibers.

06:56.569 --> 06:57.903
So we're looking for Bambi.

06:57.937 --> 07:00.872
No, deerskin from apparel.

07:01.545 --> 07:03.708
W... Moccasins, a tepee?

07:03.743 --> 07:07.078
No, tepees are generally
constructed from buffalo hides.

07:07.113 --> 07:09.414
W... Wow you are so literal.

07:09.448 --> 07:12.421
But deerskin actually
has great tactility.

07:12.541 --> 07:15.086
Small pores make it soft, tough...

07:15.669 --> 07:16.964
Work gloves.

07:16.965 --> 07:18.056
So no prints.

07:20.192 --> 07:21.159
Oh! What?

07:21.193 --> 07:22.794
Jorge thinks you're hot.

07:22.828 --> 07:23.579
Forget it.

07:23.580 --> 07:25.024
Come on, Jane. Listen to me.

07:25.025 --> 07:26.350
Every time he looks at you,

07:26.351 --> 07:30.184
he contracts his orbicularis
oculi and pars orbitalis.

07:30.185 --> 07:32.886
Gross. It's facial muscles. Please.

07:32.921 --> 07:35.122
Only if you tell
me what killed her.

07:39.561 --> 07:41.395
There should be more blood

07:41.429 --> 07:43.897
associated with her
facial lacerations.

07:43.932 --> 07:46.734
I'm gonna have so much
fun on my couch, alone.

07:46.768 --> 07:48.268
And it looks like

07:48.303 --> 07:50.637
the assault and the rape
happened post-mortem.

07:50.672 --> 07:54.513
What, she was raped and
beaten after she was killed?

07:54.514 --> 07:55.265
So what killed her?

07:55.266 --> 07:56.593
I don't know yet.

07:56.594 --> 07:58.912
Well, I don't know when I'm
gonna have time for dinner.

07:58.947 --> 08:01.849
An adrenaline response to
panic overstressed her heart,

08:01.883 --> 08:04.218
which was already
compromised by diabetes.

08:04.252 --> 08:06.820
So, why rape and beat
her once she was dead?

08:08.056 --> 08:09.957
Look at this.

08:13.136 --> 08:14.367
"Merch."

08:14.562 --> 08:16.263
Means "girl" in welsh.

08:16.297 --> 08:19.366
Since when do lawyers
have club stamps?

08:24.205 --> 08:26.406
Yeah, she came in Monday
nights like clockwork.

08:26.441 --> 08:27.708
She was here last night.

08:27.742 --> 08:29.510
Did you see her leave?

08:29.544 --> 08:30.677
It was packed.

08:30.712 --> 08:33.380
Did you see her, uh,
with... with her wife?

08:33.971 --> 08:35.505
No, but she talked about her.

08:35.506 --> 08:37.518
I mean, it seemed like a -
like a good relationship.

08:37.552 --> 08:38.852
As far as marriages go.

08:38.886 --> 08:41.688
Yeah. We have that in common.

08:41.722 --> 08:44.424
Rob was here last night.
He worked the door.

08:44.459 --> 08:45.793
Last name?

08:45.827 --> 08:47.227
Thatcher. It's not him, though.

08:47.262 --> 08:48.896
I checked him out
before I hired him.

08:48.930 --> 08:50.230
He's clean enough to squeak.

08:50.265 --> 08:51.865
Hey.

08:51.900 --> 08:53.509
Detective Rizzoli.
This is Detective Frost.

08:53.510 --> 08:56.278
You know her? This the dead chick?

08:56.279 --> 08:57.357
Yeah.

08:57.358 --> 08:58.705
I heard about it on the radio.

08:58.740 --> 09:01.542
Yeah, she slid up in here
right before happy hour ended.

09:01.576 --> 09:02.976
Drinks go up after 7:00.

09:03.011 --> 09:04.444
Did you see her with anybody?

09:05.513 --> 09:07.714
We have a lot of
good-looking ladies here.

09:07.749 --> 09:09.216
Did you see her leave?

09:09.250 --> 09:11.418
No. Sorry.

09:11.452 --> 09:12.486
God, I hate this.

09:12.520 --> 09:14.555
If she'd just gone someplace else,

09:14.589 --> 09:15.789
she'd still be alive.

09:16.280 --> 09:17.624
Why? 'Cause it's a lesbian bar?

09:17.625 --> 09:18.725
Yeah.

09:18.760 --> 09:22.296
I didn't take these
psychos seriously.

09:22.330 --> 09:25.732
It's Massachusetts.
Same-sex marriage is legal here.

09:27.659 --> 09:29.074
Can we take this?

09:29.075 --> 09:30.838
Yeah, it's yours. Thanks a lot.

09:31.339 --> 09:33.807
If you think of anything...

09:34.756 --> 09:35.742
All right.

09:35.777 --> 09:36.943
Escalating threats.

09:36.978 --> 09:39.146
Desecration of Katie's body.

09:41.486 --> 09:43.921
Looks to me like we got
ourselves a hate crime.

09:59.054 --> 10:01.158
Uh, "sons and daughters of Adam."

10:01.159 --> 10:02.899
That's your catchphrase, isn't it?

10:02.900 --> 10:06.870
I'm offended to see sacred words
associated with pornography.

10:06.904 --> 10:09.206
How about associated with murder?

10:09.979 --> 10:11.148
I-I think it's interesting

10:11.149 --> 10:13.910
that they sent a female
and an african-american

10:13.945 --> 10:16.479
to interview me about
a homosexual murder.

10:16.514 --> 10:19.115
You don't like women or
african-americans either?

10:19.150 --> 10:21.117
Well, I have a right to my opinion.

10:21.152 --> 10:23.386
Only if you don't
enforce it with a 2x4.

10:23.421 --> 10:25.322
We're gonna need to see
a list of your members.

10:25.356 --> 10:28.158
Oh, surely. I came prepared.

10:31.232 --> 10:32.687
Those are all members?

10:32.688 --> 10:33.720
We're national.

10:34.723 --> 10:38.793
Satan is using homosexuals to
destroy the kingdom of God.

10:39.795 --> 10:42.196
Be on the lookout for
a man in a red cape

10:42.231 --> 10:44.265
with a tail and pointy ears.

10:45.067 --> 10:47.368
I will pray for you.

10:47.402 --> 10:50.104
No, thank you. I'll do it myself.

10:51.173 --> 10:53.574
And, so, this drunk, with a knife,

10:53.609 --> 10:56.501
is outrunning my old
partner, Korsak.

10:56.502 --> 10:57.965
He finally catches up to him.

10:57.966 --> 10:59.789
He grabs him by the shorts -
true story...

10:59.790 --> 11:02.114
and...they rip right off.

11:02.115 --> 11:03.949
Please tell me he's
wearing underwear.

11:03.983 --> 11:05.617
No. No, he's not.

11:05.652 --> 11:06.633
No. No.

11:06.634 --> 11:08.987
So, that was my first
week on the job.

11:09.022 --> 11:10.689
I got to tackle a naked guy.

11:10.724 --> 11:12.024
Nice.

11:12.058 --> 11:13.025
Yeah.

11:14.227 --> 11:15.928
I think that sounds like fun.

11:23.394 --> 11:26.297
Anyone for some, uh,
dessert, some coffee?

11:26.298 --> 11:28.632
Actually, it -
it's getting kind of late.

11:29.768 --> 11:33.070
You know, I think I need
to use the ladies' room.

11:33.104 --> 11:34.342
Oh. Jane?

11:34.343 --> 11:35.414
Hmm? Will you join me?

11:35.415 --> 11:36.640
No, no, no. I don't need to go.

11:36.675 --> 11:37.708
Oh.

11:38.777 --> 11:39.777
I think you do.

11:40.330 --> 11:41.821
I need to go to the ladies' room,

11:41.822 --> 11:43.255
if you'll excuse me.

11:43.289 --> 11:44.289
Please.

11:46.860 --> 11:48.127
What are you... Oh!

11:48.161 --> 11:50.896
Shh! Come on.

11:50.930 --> 11:53.999
I thought you needed
to go to the restroom!

11:54.033 --> 11:56.869
That was a ruse.
Well, do you like him?

12:03.943 --> 12:06.645
He's sexy. Mm, yeah,
I think you should take him home.

12:06.679 --> 12:09.148
Maura. What? You said he was sexy.

12:09.182 --> 12:11.216
Well, just because I like the
way he looks in yoga class

12:11.251 --> 12:13.285
doesn't mean I'm gonna like
the way he looks in my bed.

12:13.319 --> 12:14.620
Right.

12:14.654 --> 12:17.823
But did you know that sex
releases immunoglobulin "a"?

12:17.857 --> 12:19.091
It wards off colds.

12:21.995 --> 12:23.162
No. Not tonight.

12:24.164 --> 12:26.298
A-and I didn't shave my legs.

12:29.235 --> 12:30.536
Nice try.

12:30.570 --> 12:32.805
What kind of person are you?

12:39.879 --> 12:42.714
You're like a racecar...

12:42.749 --> 12:45.951
Finely tuned... beautiful...

12:45.985 --> 12:48.120
Fast...

12:48.154 --> 12:49.955
I'm not that fast.

12:51.991 --> 12:55.194
Hey! Wow, look at you.

12:55.228 --> 12:57.362
Aw, I should take her for a walk.

12:57.397 --> 12:58.697
Hm? Okay.

12:58.731 --> 13:01.300
Let's take her for a walk.
Come here, little boo-boo.

13:01.334 --> 13:03.569
Come on. Okay.

13:03.603 --> 13:06.438
Uh, Maura said that
you're in medicine.

13:06.472 --> 13:07.739
Are you a doctor?

13:07.774 --> 13:09.007
No.

13:09.042 --> 13:10.976
Uh...E.M.T.?

13:11.010 --> 13:12.110
Nurse.

13:13.112 --> 13:16.415
A male nurse. That is so cool.

13:16.449 --> 13:18.383
You should get the
biodegradable ones.

13:18.418 --> 13:19.484
Right.

13:20.920 --> 13:24.656
Uh, so, what happened between
you and your girlfriend?

13:24.691 --> 13:27.025
Oh, we didn't agree about kids.

13:27.060 --> 13:28.994
Oh, she wanted them, you didn't?

13:29.028 --> 13:30.162
No.

13:30.196 --> 13:33.165
I just love the idea of
being a stay-at-home daddy.

13:33.199 --> 13:35.334
But she wanted to stay home, too.

13:35.368 --> 13:38.136
Someone's got to work, right?

13:39.706 --> 13:42.908
Yeah. Wow. I'm surprised.

13:42.942 --> 13:46.778
Why? Because I'm Hispanic?
It's a new world.

13:46.813 --> 13:50.215
See, I am looking for
a really strong woman.

13:50.250 --> 13:53.952
Someone who knows how
to hold warrior two,

13:53.987 --> 13:56.021
like you.

13:57.423 --> 14:00.659
Come on. Let's go. Come on.

14:02.262 --> 14:03.595
Coming? Yeah.

14:03.630 --> 14:05.063
Come on. Okay.

14:05.098 --> 14:08.267
Let's go for our walkie-kins.
So much fun!

14:18.344 --> 14:19.378
Really?

14:19.965 --> 14:21.505
That bad?

14:21.506 --> 14:22.981
I thought you said
you couldn't lie.

14:23.016 --> 14:25.117
What do you mean? I can't.

14:25.151 --> 14:26.151
You did.

14:26.185 --> 14:28.222
Only one time,

14:28.223 --> 14:30.417
when I said I'd finished
my homework and I hadn't,

14:30.418 --> 14:32.644
and I immediately went vasovagal.

14:32.645 --> 14:33.611
Fainted.

14:33.646 --> 14:35.246
Jorge's in "medicine"?

14:36.482 --> 14:38.316
Technically, yes, he is.

14:38.350 --> 14:40.118
What's his specialty? Lactation?

14:40.683 --> 14:42.133
Orthopedics.

14:42.134 --> 14:44.803
Joe Grant was a Detective,
he was sexy,

14:44.837 --> 14:46.718
and he was a perfect match for you.

14:46.719 --> 14:47.853
Well, I kind of liked him.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.150
Yeah, well,
you butted heads with him

14:49.151 --> 14:50.622
until he moved to Washington.

14:51.691 --> 14:54.126
So you hooked me up
with nurse Jorge.

14:57.096 --> 15:01.466
Wh... I... I just... Yes.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.602
It's not funny.

15:04.904 --> 15:08.173
Hey. Anything come up on
those background checks?

15:08.208 --> 15:10.475
Still waiting on that, uh,
bouncer from the club,

15:10.510 --> 15:12.144
and no red flags on anybody here.

15:12.178 --> 15:15.581
Somebody's got a boyfriend.

15:15.615 --> 15:17.916
Someone should mind
his own business.

15:17.951 --> 15:19.351
What... No.

15:19.385 --> 15:21.920
Your eyes are like
pools of midnight!

15:21.955 --> 15:24.523
No! Come on. What? What?

15:24.557 --> 15:28.694
Your-r-r lips are like...
Tempur-pedic pillows.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.596
Really? Just give this.

15:32.131 --> 15:34.900
"Dinner. Saturday.
I'm already in the kitchen.

15:34.934 --> 15:35.901
Jorge."

15:35.935 --> 15:37.369
Sounds kind of sissy to me.

15:37.403 --> 15:38.837
Hey, guy cooks.

15:38.872 --> 15:40.038
Yeah, I know.

15:40.073 --> 15:41.073
It's a match.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.075
'Scuse me? The bouncer.

15:43.109 --> 15:45.077
"Robert Thatcher"... it's an alias.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.278
Real name is "Roy Tompkins."

15:46.312 --> 15:48.447
So, that's why he lied.
Look at this.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.582
Outstanding warrant... New York City

15:50.617 --> 15:52.284
for criminal sexual assault.

15:52.318 --> 15:53.352
Come on.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.691
Hey, Roy. We need to talk to you.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.230
Oh. I wouldn't do that, Roy.

16:15.742 --> 16:18.243
Been holdin' out on me, Bruce Lee!

16:24.250 --> 16:27.586
We can do this all day, Roy.
What happened to Katie?

16:27.620 --> 16:30.355
Look, I can't tell you
what I don't know!

16:40.500 --> 16:42.100
What is so important?

16:42.135 --> 16:44.102
Jorge dropped off lunch for you.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.140
That's not why I interrupted you.

16:48.174 --> 16:50.909
I extracted the killer's
DNA from the murder weapon.

16:50.944 --> 16:52.377
Who is he?

16:52.925 --> 16:56.190
Well, there was no match in CODIS,
but it's not a "he."

16:56.191 --> 16:57.727
It's a "she."

16:58.084 --> 16:59.284
The killer's a woman?

17:07.483 --> 17:09.185
Were off the killer's glove?

17:09.186 --> 17:10.421
Seams were breached,

17:10.454 --> 17:14.364
and DNA tests confirmed that
the sweat was from a female.

17:14.365 --> 17:15.484
Yeah, we already know that,

17:15.486 --> 17:17.142
and a male accomplice raped her.

17:17.143 --> 17:18.844
No, injuries are consistent

17:18.877 --> 17:21.413
with a non-biological
phallus-shaped object.

17:23.383 --> 17:24.715
You mean a dildo?

17:26.886 --> 17:30.022
Yes, I believe that is
the popular term for it.

17:30.056 --> 17:33.392
But did you know that a
28,000-year-old stone phallus

17:33.426 --> 17:35.061
was recently found
in a German cave?

17:35.062 --> 17:38.330
Ice-age men were using
it for knapping flints.

17:39.399 --> 17:42.601
Yeah, ice-age women were using
it for making sparks, too.

17:43.169 --> 17:44.536
Yeah, okay.

17:45.041 --> 17:47.706
So, if she wasn't raped,
it's probably not a hate crime.

17:47.740 --> 17:49.374
It wasn't a robbery.

17:49.409 --> 17:51.743
I'm beginning to think
this was personal.

17:56.949 --> 17:59.518
I wonder if Jorge
read the chump study.

17:59.552 --> 18:01.386
Chump study. Probably wrote it.

18:01.421 --> 18:04.623
Chocolate happiness undergoing
more pleasantness study.

18:04.657 --> 18:06.167
Yeah, I-it actually concluded

18:06.168 --> 18:07.466
that chocolate makes us happier.

18:07.467 --> 18:09.937
Chocolate from Jorge
makes me sadder.

18:11.384 --> 18:13.146
Mmm. Flowers.

18:13.147 --> 18:15.448
Flowers have been shown
to reduce depression.

18:15.483 --> 18:17.851
Come on, Jane. Jorge's a catch.

18:17.885 --> 18:19.219
If you don't want 'em,
can I have 'em?

18:19.253 --> 18:20.820
Jorge? Yeah, he's all yours.

18:20.855 --> 18:24.023
Maybe if I get fat,
he'll stop calling.

18:24.696 --> 18:26.374
I just think if you allow him

18:26.375 --> 18:27.399
to see all sides of you,

18:27.400 --> 18:29.271
then he'll stop calling.

18:35.936 --> 18:36.437
You know what?

18:36.438 --> 18:39.161
I just heard what that sounded like,
and that is...

18:39.162 --> 18:42.530
what I meant to say was that...

18:42.531 --> 18:46.600
Human beings have good
and bad traits, you know,

18:46.635 --> 18:48.569
a-and you have, you know...

18:48.603 --> 18:51.005
Some characteristics
that are a little...

18:51.039 --> 18:52.540
N-not as, um...

18:52.574 --> 18:54.475
Wow, fudge clusters.

18:57.588 --> 18:59.814
Katie was deleting her...

18:59.848 --> 19:02.616
Search history on her computer.

19:02.651 --> 19:04.185
Why? What was she hiding?

19:05.487 --> 19:07.455
Have we checked the wife's alibi?

19:07.489 --> 19:08.456
Solid.

19:08.490 --> 19:10.691
Tracked all her calls... E.R., 911.

19:10.725 --> 19:13.060
Alarm company confirms she
activated her home alarm

19:13.094 --> 19:16.897
03 P.M., didn't break the
circuit again till 6:17 A.M.

19:16.932 --> 19:18.933
She didn't do it. How do you know?

19:18.967 --> 19:21.101
Got Mel's scorecard from
the night of the murder.

19:21.136 --> 19:23.537
She's a hell of a bowler.
She had a turkey.

19:23.572 --> 19:24.972
Why would she do that?

19:25.006 --> 19:26.640
That's three strikes
in a row, Maura.

19:26.675 --> 19:28.542
Oh. Wish I could get
her for our team.

19:28.577 --> 19:29.910
But you got to be divorced.

19:33.248 --> 19:35.282
Can you try to restore all
that history that Kate deleted?

19:35.317 --> 19:37.084
Let's give it a shot.

19:47.395 --> 19:49.129
Really yummy.

19:50.198 --> 19:53.167
Sorted by popularity.

19:53.201 --> 19:57.538
Hmm, spent a lot of time
on cupid4girls.com...

19:57.572 --> 19:59.607
Lipstidate.com.

19:59.641 --> 20:01.375
Online hook-up services.

20:01.409 --> 20:02.376
Huh.

20:02.410 --> 20:03.978
So, Katie was cheating on her wife.

20:04.012 --> 20:06.447
Somebody posted a message for
her the day she was killed.

20:08.483 --> 20:11.452
"Liked our time at the merch.
Want to play again?"

20:11.486 --> 20:13.888
Our vic was having more
than a drink after work.

20:13.922 --> 20:15.623
Can you trace the I.P. Addresses?

20:17.292 --> 20:18.792
Smart. What?

20:18.827 --> 20:20.895
They set up the website to
hide all I.P. Addresses...

20:20.929 --> 20:22.062
protects their customers.

20:22.097 --> 20:23.151
Yeah, and hides the cheaters.

20:23.152 --> 20:25.666
Why work so hard to get
the right to marry...

20:25.700 --> 20:27.334
to do the same thing
that straight couples do?

20:27.369 --> 20:28.335
I don't know.

20:28.370 --> 20:30.404
Hey, Korsak.

20:31.172 --> 20:32.740
They kind of...

20:33.291 --> 20:35.363
Resemble each other.

20:35.420 --> 20:37.380
Jane and the victim.

20:41.386 --> 20:44.722
You're right. Be a shame to
waste an opportunity like that.

20:44.756 --> 20:45.723
No. We could...

20:45.757 --> 20:47.289
No way.

20:47.290 --> 20:48.718
We could try and bait a trap.

20:48.719 --> 20:50.453
Post the same kind
of message Katie did,

20:50.487 --> 20:51.645
attract the same kind of woman.

20:51.646 --> 20:54.318
Arrange dates, get DNA,
see if we get a match.

20:54.319 --> 20:56.201
How? We stick a fork in 'em?

20:56.202 --> 20:57.803
You buy her a drink,
you take the glass.

20:57.837 --> 21:00.305
Club owner seemed
like she'd cooperate.

21:00.340 --> 21:02.708
Jane could...Possibly...
Wear a wire.

21:05.244 --> 21:06.511
No.

21:06.546 --> 21:08.368
No, I'm not gonna go undercover

21:08.369 --> 21:09.982
to troll for lesbian dates

21:09.983 --> 21:12.919
on the random chance that
we catch a killer, no.

21:14.288 --> 21:16.122
I think she loves the idea.

21:16.156 --> 21:17.723
Me too.

21:17.758 --> 21:19.008
Why do they do this?

21:19.009 --> 21:21.487
The categories are
such stereotypes.

21:21.488 --> 21:24.896
"Femme," "boy next door,"
"sporty," or "fine."

21:24.897 --> 21:26.831
Jane's definitely "fine."

21:28.734 --> 21:30.768
I'm just saying,
for the purposes of the ad,

21:30.803 --> 21:33.638
you know, to draw
the best response.

21:33.672 --> 21:34.772
Yeah. Right.

21:34.807 --> 21:37.560
Okay, I-I j-just
have to check a box,

21:37.561 --> 21:41.546
so, "femme," "butch,
" "lipstick," "chapstick,"

21:41.580 --> 21:43.181
"sporty."

21:43.731 --> 21:45.516
I've seen her break a chair

21:45.551 --> 21:47.618
over the head of a
meth-crazed gangbanger.

21:48.176 --> 21:49.791
So..."Butch"?

21:49.792 --> 21:50.394
Yeah.

21:50.395 --> 21:52.290
I mean, she took him out.

21:52.324 --> 21:54.392
No. No, no, no, no.

21:54.426 --> 21:55.793
She's... no, no. She's my friend.

21:55.828 --> 21:57.395
I-I'm not putting "butch."

21:57.429 --> 21:59.163
She's... I'm putting "sporty."

21:59.198 --> 22:01.566
Just check what the
victim checked, huh?

22:01.600 --> 22:05.036
Oh. Let's see. "Lipstick lesbian."

22:05.805 --> 22:07.538
I love undercover.

22:16.114 --> 22:18.149
"Nice and supportive"
doesn't mean weak.

22:18.183 --> 22:19.454
Please.

22:19.574 --> 22:23.287
Jorge...is more
submissive than my dog.

22:23.322 --> 22:25.490
Aww, yes, he is! Aww!

22:27.125 --> 22:29.560
Maybe I should be a lesbian.

22:29.595 --> 22:32.263
Aww, well, wishes can come true.

22:32.297 --> 22:34.932
Frost and korsak wanted to
fill out your dating profile.

22:34.967 --> 22:35.933
I typed.

22:35.968 --> 22:37.502
You what?

22:37.536 --> 22:39.470
If it wasn't for me,
you'd be "butch."

22:40.639 --> 22:43.074
Y... you put my photo and profile

22:43.108 --> 22:45.209
on a gay-dating website?

22:45.244 --> 22:46.521
It's your best shot

22:46.522 --> 22:49.280
at getting DNA and
breaking this case.

22:49.314 --> 22:52.783
No, it's our best shot.
You're going with me.

22:52.818 --> 22:53.818
No.

22:53.852 --> 22:55.219
Yes, Dr. Isles.

22:55.254 --> 22:58.700
W... I don't have time to
train a female detective

22:58.701 --> 23:00.936
how to collect and preserve DNA.

23:00.970 --> 23:03.038
W... You're going.

23:05.441 --> 23:06.608
There. Look.

23:06.642 --> 23:09.611
All these women think you're hot.

23:09.645 --> 23:11.646
Wow. Mm-hmm.

23:11.681 --> 23:13.745
You realize one of these women
could be Katie's killer.

23:13.746 --> 23:15.617
And not this one. Listen.

23:15.618 --> 23:19.251
She likes to hike,
has season tickets to the celtics.

23:19.252 --> 23:20.285
What?

23:20.319 --> 23:23.421
Front row? Oh,
I might flip for that.

23:23.456 --> 23:25.757
I don't understand online dating.

23:25.791 --> 23:27.990
People reveal too
much about themselves.

23:27.991 --> 23:29.470
"I want to connect with someone

23:29.471 --> 23:31.799
who can make me more of who I am."

23:31.800 --> 23:33.107
"...Who can be strong

23:33.108 --> 23:35.788
without needing me to be weak."

23:38.359 --> 23:41.528
I wonder what kind of
women we would like

23:41.562 --> 23:42.696
if we liked women.

23:42.697 --> 23:43.685
What?!

23:43.686 --> 23:46.387
Well, um, first of all,
I would be the guy.

23:46.422 --> 23:49.090
That's a clichÃ©.
Why would you be the guy?

23:49.124 --> 23:50.925
Because.

23:50.960 --> 23:52.527
Because you're bossy?

23:52.561 --> 23:53.928
So are you.

23:53.963 --> 23:55.163
No, I'm not. Yes, you are.

23:55.197 --> 23:56.464
You're just soft and polite

23:56.498 --> 23:57.999
when you're bossing people around.

23:58.033 --> 23:59.834
Well, it's a good thing
you're not my type.

23:59.868 --> 24:01.126
What do you mean I'm not your type?

24:01.127 --> 24:02.837
That is so rude.

24:03.749 --> 24:07.212
Well, you don't know how to relax.

24:07.213 --> 24:10.248
And you wear your shoes
and your clothes to bed,

24:10.283 --> 24:12.884
and you just admitted
that you're bossy.

24:12.919 --> 24:16.476
Okay, yeah. I'm bossy. Right.

24:16.477 --> 24:20.546
You put my picture and profile
on a gay-dating website,

24:20.581 --> 24:21.781
and I'm bossy.

24:21.815 --> 24:22.982
Right. Okay.

24:23.016 --> 24:25.585
After I said no, by the way.

24:28.122 --> 24:29.822
What are you doing?

24:29.857 --> 24:33.092
Meditating. It's too
stressful to argue with you.

24:33.127 --> 24:34.460
Well, just think...

24:34.495 --> 24:35.950
because of you,
by this time tomorrow,

24:35.951 --> 24:38.133
I could be on a date with a killer.

24:42.423 --> 24:44.471
Yaaay.

24:57.306 --> 25:00.475
It's okay, buddy. It's just me.

25:02.389 --> 25:03.890
What are you doing here?

25:06.694 --> 25:08.861
I guess I fell asleep
while I was meditating.

25:08.896 --> 25:12.298
Well, at least you don't snore.

25:12.333 --> 25:13.866
Oh, well, you kick.

25:13.901 --> 25:15.035
No, no, no. That's not me.

25:15.036 --> 25:18.354
That was jo. She runs in her sleep.

25:18.355 --> 25:20.275
Myoclonic contractions.

25:20.276 --> 25:22.044
Dogs have dog dreams.

25:25.148 --> 25:26.148
Wow.

25:26.182 --> 25:28.415
Maybe we should take
a look and see if...

25:28.416 --> 25:31.987
if anybody else signed
up to hook into you.

25:34.424 --> 25:37.826
That's not how you say it.
It's "hook up with you."

25:39.062 --> 25:40.095
Whatever.

25:40.129 --> 25:43.065
"Whatever"? I'm the one hooking up.

25:43.099 --> 25:44.766
Well, pretending to.

25:44.801 --> 25:46.868
That's easy for you to say.

25:47.971 --> 25:49.938
I can't believe I'm actually hoping

25:49.973 --> 25:53.175
that the killer wants to meet me.

25:53.646 --> 25:55.125
Damn it. Jorge.

25:55.126 --> 25:58.413
Jorge, Jorge, Jorge...

25:58.448 --> 26:00.949
Jorge.

26:00.984 --> 26:03.752
Oh, in case I missed
his first e-mail...

26:03.786 --> 26:05.320
And his 10th... Jorge.

26:05.355 --> 26:07.556
He's so nice. God.

26:07.590 --> 26:09.066
Maybe that's what you need.

26:09.067 --> 26:12.294
You need somebody...
Loving and supportive.

26:12.328 --> 26:13.562
Like a hamster.

26:13.596 --> 26:15.263
Jane.

26:15.298 --> 26:16.798
What?

26:16.833 --> 26:20.346
Well, I mean, y...
What you think of as a "great guy"

26:20.347 --> 26:21.914
is an average woman.

26:23.517 --> 26:25.566
You know, I mean, if I wanted
someone to walk the dog with me

26:25.567 --> 26:28.187
and talk about my feelings,
I'd be gay.

26:28.221 --> 26:29.989
You're not gonna say
that to him, are you?

26:30.023 --> 26:33.159
I will if you don't. You got me into this,
so get me out of it.

26:37.364 --> 26:38.500
Please.

26:40.534 --> 26:42.568
Uh-oh. What?

26:42.602 --> 26:44.837
Now I understand why you
always look like this.

26:44.871 --> 26:46.238
Excuse me?

26:46.273 --> 26:48.441
You have nothing to wear.

26:51.011 --> 26:53.312
This is completely appropriate.

26:54.781 --> 26:57.750
Mm. You know, I-it's perfect.

26:57.784 --> 27:01.821
Where exactly am I going to
hide the camera and the wire?

27:02.889 --> 27:05.257
I know... in my thong.

27:07.527 --> 27:09.929
Well, maybe you could wear a brief.

27:11.164 --> 27:12.331
No.

27:12.365 --> 27:14.834
Mark twain said,
"the clothes make the man."

27:14.868 --> 27:17.103
He also said, "naked people
have little or no influence."

27:18.171 --> 27:19.438
This is very serious.

27:19.473 --> 27:22.041
Maura, come on.
I-it'll be fine, all right?

27:22.075 --> 27:25.111
W-we're trained professionals.
We know what we're doing.

27:25.145 --> 27:27.513
We've actually been
undercover a few times before,

27:27.547 --> 27:29.715
so, um... let me handle this.

27:29.750 --> 27:32.929
Okay. It's fine.
You don't want my help.

27:32.930 --> 27:35.888
It's like trying to dress a
squirmy 6-year-old, anyway.

27:35.922 --> 27:38.583
Everything's too short, too itchy.

27:38.584 --> 27:40.178
"I can't walk in that."

27:40.179 --> 27:42.347
Maura, we all love the
fact that you dress

27:42.381 --> 27:44.783
like you're about to strut
down a Paris runway.

27:44.817 --> 27:46.985
It's... it's...Interesting.

27:47.019 --> 27:48.653
It's endearing. Sexy.

27:52.463 --> 27:55.227
It's, uh, it's... it's -
it's fashionable.

27:56.295 --> 27:58.029
Oh, so... so that's what you think?

27:58.064 --> 28:00.132
You think this is all
about fashion for me?

28:00.166 --> 28:02.467
This is gonna be good.

28:02.502 --> 28:05.036
Um...No? I-I-it's
not about fashion?

28:05.071 --> 28:06.304
No, it's not.

28:06.339 --> 28:08.073
What is it about, then?

28:10.943 --> 28:15.046
I used to sit at the
MusÃ©e D'Orsay for hours

28:15.081 --> 28:17.048
and just stare at it.

28:17.083 --> 28:19.317
Do you know what I mean?

28:19.352 --> 28:22.254
Yes, the Rizzoli family
vacations there every summer.

28:23.322 --> 28:27.159
Have you ever tried...
to appreciate...

28:27.193 --> 28:29.027
Euler's number "e,"

28:29.061 --> 28:30.569
you know, the beautiful equation

28:30.570 --> 28:33.365
that connects three
constants of mathematics?

28:33.399 --> 28:34.399
Have you?

28:34.433 --> 28:36.234
Yeah, I tried it once.

28:40.606 --> 28:43.308
I am in awe of what
human beings can do.

28:43.342 --> 28:47.112
I am in awe of...
of the hand-knit channel stitching

28:47.146 --> 28:48.413
on this sweater.

28:48.447 --> 28:50.949
I am in awe of the artisan

28:50.983 --> 28:53.985
who molded and shaped this shoe.

28:57.356 --> 29:00.358
I cannot wait to see
what you're gonna wear.

29:06.599 --> 29:09.668
There's a... there's a
back room that way. Just...

29:09.702 --> 29:12.170
W-why don't we do
it right here? Yeah?

29:14.207 --> 29:16.341
Guys must eat you up.

29:16.375 --> 29:17.909
Why? Why do you say that?

29:18.326 --> 29:20.302
'Cause you're just like 'em.

29:20.360 --> 29:23.615
Beautiful... dominant energy.

29:23.649 --> 29:25.951
If you ever feel like
getting adventurous...

29:25.985 --> 29:28.687
I'll... I'll give you a call.

29:42.735 --> 29:43.702
Wow.

29:44.275 --> 29:45.794
Dr. Isles is...

29:45.795 --> 29:47.005
...Not very doctorly.

29:47.039 --> 29:49.207
...At all.

29:53.646 --> 29:54.946
Your table's ready, miss.

29:54.981 --> 29:57.115
Oh, my God. Put this on.

29:57.149 --> 29:59.718
No. I'm undercover. Follow me.

29:59.752 --> 30:02.187
Oh, my God.

30:10.029 --> 30:12.530
Thank you.

30:18.838 --> 30:20.939
There she goes. First date.

30:22.475 --> 30:25.878
I finally work up the nerve,
you know, and call them.

30:25.879 --> 30:27.607
I get the machine.

30:27.608 --> 30:31.216
So I go, "mom, dad...

30:31.250 --> 30:33.318
I'm gay!"

30:34.987 --> 30:36.988
How'd you do it?

30:40.660 --> 30:42.294
Well...

30:42.328 --> 30:43.528
I...

30:43.562 --> 30:46.231
Ladies, may I get you
something to drink?

30:48.534 --> 30:50.536
No. We're good.

30:50.537 --> 30:52.839
May I take that for you?

30:52.840 --> 30:54.739
We're good, right, Miranda?

30:56.507 --> 30:58.942
My real name's Mary Anne.

30:58.976 --> 31:01.111
"Hi, mom, dad. I'm gay."

31:01.145 --> 31:02.612
Whatever happened to
"call me back"?

31:02.647 --> 31:04.859
I mean, you leave your
most personal information

31:04.860 --> 31:06.122
on an answering machine.

31:06.123 --> 31:08.752
A friend of mine asked
for a divorce by texting.

31:08.786 --> 31:11.092
No manners anymore.
Yeah, you had it down.

31:11.093 --> 31:13.328
So much more polite to
serve divorce papers.

31:32.682 --> 31:35.116
23 when the sun comes up 23

31:39.322 --> 31:41.790
I always fall for girls like you.

31:43.292 --> 31:44.426
Like what?

31:44.460 --> 31:46.895
Oh, smart, tough...

31:48.464 --> 31:49.965
...Complicated.

31:51.033 --> 31:54.736
Mm, my hands are sore from...

31:54.770 --> 31:57.205
Volleyball.

31:57.240 --> 31:59.874
You're gonna break my heart.

31:59.909 --> 32:03.044
Mm. Wow. They get right into it.

32:03.079 --> 32:05.380
All they talk about
are their feelings.

32:05.414 --> 32:06.581
They're women.

32:07.147 --> 32:09.317
Oh, and you're... you're an expert?

32:09.352 --> 32:10.585
I been married 20 years.

32:10.620 --> 32:13.355
To three different women. So?

32:13.389 --> 32:15.857
So, that's not a very good
track record, Detective.

32:15.891 --> 32:18.159
Yeah, look where you're spending
your Friday night, Romeo.

32:18.194 --> 32:20.362
Oh, real ladies' man.

32:36.222 --> 32:37.995
Rizzoli's good at this.

32:37.996 --> 32:39.794
At what? Being a lesbian?

32:39.795 --> 32:41.062
Yeah.

32:41.096 --> 32:42.397
No! Shut up. I'm listening.

32:42.431 --> 32:44.899
No, you're not. You're talking.

32:58.647 --> 33:02.650
Oh, my God!

33:02.685 --> 33:04.585
I like tall brunettes.

33:06.488 --> 33:07.789
I'm Jane.

33:07.823 --> 33:10.525
I know. I saw your profile.

33:10.559 --> 33:11.759
I'm Claire.

33:12.761 --> 33:14.896
Uh, can I get you another drink?

33:15.964 --> 33:19.367
No, I've, um... I've had
enough to get brave.

33:19.401 --> 33:21.336
The next stage is "weepy."

33:21.370 --> 33:23.571
That's okay. I don't mind.

33:23.605 --> 33:24.972
She is creeping me out.

33:25.007 --> 33:26.974
Rizzoli? No, the other one.

33:32.748 --> 33:34.415
This is gonna freak you out,

33:34.450 --> 33:37.218
but you kind of look like
that girl who was killed.

33:38.520 --> 33:40.121
Katie...Somebody.

33:41.190 --> 33:43.057
Did you see her
picture in the paper?

33:43.092 --> 33:44.158
Yeah.

33:44.193 --> 33:46.861
Yeah, it's... it's so scary,
isn't it, that...

33:46.895 --> 33:48.763
It could have been any of us.

33:51.133 --> 33:53.334
You want to hear the weirdest part?

33:53.369 --> 33:54.235
Yeah.

33:54.269 --> 33:55.970
I think I was her last date.

33:58.474 --> 33:59.640
Really?

34:01.043 --> 34:02.176
Reel her in.

34:02.211 --> 34:03.978
Did you tell the police?

34:07.282 --> 34:10.851
W-we chatted online, met up here.

34:10.886 --> 34:14.722
We really hit it off.
Then I saw her ring.

34:14.757 --> 34:16.824
I don't hook up with married women.

34:16.859 --> 34:18.726
"I don't hook up
with married women"?

34:18.761 --> 34:20.395
She's saying she doesn't cheat.

34:22.947 --> 34:24.212
Is that cheating?

34:26.849 --> 34:28.824
Are you serious?

34:31.639 --> 34:34.041
Well, what was she like?

34:36.344 --> 34:38.346
I really liked her.

34:39.648 --> 34:42.083
She shouldn't have lied
about being married.

34:43.485 --> 34:45.286
And if she hadn't...

34:47.222 --> 34:48.856
...She might still be alive.

35:04.068 --> 35:05.916
None of the allele
frequencies correspond

35:05.917 --> 35:08.332
to the DNA isolated from the 2x4.

35:08.333 --> 35:10.534
The blood on the weapon
didn't match any of my dates?

35:10.568 --> 35:12.803
W...Not even Claire? No.

35:13.459 --> 35:14.450
Hey.

35:14.451 --> 35:17.148
CSRU went through Katie's papers.

35:17.149 --> 35:18.483
Look at this.

35:18.963 --> 35:21.914
Hey, our vic inherited
half a million dollars

35:21.915 --> 35:23.268
while she was still single.

35:23.269 --> 35:25.003
She keeps it in the
event of a divorce,

35:25.037 --> 35:26.037
but if she dies...

35:27.039 --> 35:28.907
It all goes to the grieving widow.

35:28.941 --> 35:30.742
Hell of a consolation prize.

35:30.776 --> 35:31.664
Widow's got motive.

35:31.665 --> 35:33.499
Yeah, but she's got
a titanium alibi.

35:33.534 --> 35:35.668
She can prove she was bowling.

35:38.238 --> 35:40.406
You know, Katie was very careful

35:40.440 --> 35:42.542
about controlling her diabetes.

35:42.576 --> 35:44.877
I counted nearly 100 needle sticks.

35:44.912 --> 35:46.112
So it just doesn't make any sense

35:46.146 --> 35:47.647
that she wouldn't know
she needed Insulin.

35:47.681 --> 35:50.182
Maybe she did.
Was the pump working?

35:50.217 --> 35:51.884
It was so compromised,
I can't tell.

35:52.580 --> 35:55.688
What if... I don't like sentences
that begin with "what if."

35:56.148 --> 35:57.564
Let's assume...

35:57.565 --> 35:59.299
Why is that better?

35:59.333 --> 36:02.135
...That Katie tested herself,

36:02.170 --> 36:04.304
her numbers were high,
she gave herself some Insulin...

36:04.305 --> 36:05.871
or what she thought was Insulin.

36:05.906 --> 36:07.962
No, b-because I tested the
residue in the pump...

36:07.963 --> 36:09.169
pure Insulin.

36:09.170 --> 36:11.237
Her tox screen came back negative.

36:11.272 --> 36:13.373
No signs of poisons
in Katie's body.

36:13.407 --> 36:15.075
Unless... there's something

36:15.109 --> 36:17.644
that couldn't be detected
in her bloodstream.

36:17.678 --> 36:20.914
If somebody put
something in the pump...

36:20.948 --> 36:22.916
There should be fingerprints on it.

36:32.526 --> 36:33.994
It's clean. Okay.

36:34.028 --> 36:36.429
Why aren't Katie's
prints on it, at least?

36:36.464 --> 36:38.698
Someone might have
attached it to her body

36:38.733 --> 36:39.766
and wiped it clean.

36:39.800 --> 36:42.335
That's good. I'm just guessing.

36:43.514 --> 36:45.815
All right, so,
Katie's regular Insulin pump

36:45.850 --> 36:47.484
was switched to one full of poison.

36:47.518 --> 36:49.352
She thinks she's
giving herself Insulin.

36:49.387 --> 36:50.887
She's actually killing herself.

36:51.950 --> 36:54.257
Who had access to Katie?

36:54.258 --> 36:55.910
Mel, the wife,

36:55.911 --> 36:58.809
who was at home when
Katie was being beaten.

36:58.810 --> 37:00.437
She had an accomplice. Mm-hmm.

37:00.438 --> 37:02.139
Smart killer,
because it's impossible

37:02.173 --> 37:03.473
to prove without evidence.

37:03.508 --> 37:05.008
Which we don't have.

37:06.681 --> 37:07.833
Yet.

37:10.576 --> 37:14.518
Katie was here with women, so,
obviously, she was cheating.

37:14.519 --> 37:16.487
Did you know her wife, Mel?

37:16.521 --> 37:18.088
Well, I run a bar, not a church.

37:18.123 --> 37:19.123
You know that, right?

37:19.157 --> 37:21.192
Come on.

37:21.226 --> 37:23.427
All right, well,
did Katie ever mention anything

37:23.461 --> 37:25.095
like she thought Mel
was seeing someone?

37:25.130 --> 37:27.097
No, she never did.

37:28.233 --> 37:30.601
Sorry.

37:34.573 --> 37:36.473
Hmm? No, I'm done. Thank you.

37:39.411 --> 37:40.844
Well, um...

37:42.414 --> 37:44.315
You have my number.

37:44.349 --> 37:45.883
Yeah, I do.

37:45.917 --> 37:48.085
If you have any new thoughts...

37:51.556 --> 37:54.491
You know, you said if I was
ever feeling adventurous...

38:00.765 --> 38:02.132
Yeah?

38:02.167 --> 38:03.634
Yeah.

38:22.247 --> 38:25.016
I need you to swab my neck for DNA.

38:25.050 --> 38:28.319
I'm not even going to ask why.

38:40.565 --> 38:43.567
You have 10 seconds.
There is a bus coming at you.

38:43.602 --> 38:46.437
You can either be
on it or under it.

38:55.814 --> 38:58.582
That cop is fishing. Stay strong.

38:58.617 --> 39:02.186
Yeah, I had to stand there
and watch Katie die.

39:02.220 --> 39:03.187
You know...

39:03.221 --> 39:05.189
Hey. Shh, shh, shh. It's okay.

39:05.223 --> 39:06.778
It's okay.

39:06.779 --> 39:09.827
You weren't there.
She was... she was so sick.

39:09.861 --> 39:11.695
What did you put in that pump?

39:11.730 --> 39:14.799
Fentanyl. It can't be detected.

39:15.867 --> 39:18.502
Mixed it with water,
swapped out the pumps.

39:18.537 --> 39:20.404
What if we screwed up? We didn't.

39:20.439 --> 39:23.574
Look, we get the money in 90 days.

39:23.608 --> 39:24.842
I...

39:24.876 --> 39:26.136
Shh. It's okay, baby.

39:26.137 --> 39:29.061
Hey, wait. What about
the fingerprints?

39:29.062 --> 39:30.204
You left prints?

39:30.205 --> 39:31.872
No, that's what I'm worried about.

39:31.906 --> 39:33.405
Katie's prints should
have been on the pump,

39:33.406 --> 39:35.442
but there were no prints.

39:35.476 --> 39:37.377
Wait, how do you know that?

39:37.412 --> 39:41.048
'Cause she decided
to get on the bus.

39:41.082 --> 39:42.856
Arms behind your back.

39:43.212 --> 39:47.020
Same old story -
kill your wife for the money.

39:47.055 --> 39:49.756
How could you do this?

39:49.791 --> 39:53.093
This...is as adventurous as I get.

40:04.005 --> 40:06.239
Crap. Maura. Maura.

40:06.274 --> 40:07.674
Hey. Hey!

40:09.911 --> 40:12.145
Look, I-I just want
to say that I...

40:12.180 --> 40:14.681
Support your choice, Jane.

40:16.350 --> 40:17.350
Okay.

40:18.352 --> 40:19.586
Thank you.

40:19.620 --> 40:22.222
And thank you for the
flowers and the chocolates

40:22.256 --> 40:24.558
and...The lunch.

40:24.592 --> 40:28.695
And the car battery,
even though mine was fine.

40:28.729 --> 40:31.865
Sure. You're welcome.

40:33.534 --> 40:36.169
Glad we live in a state that
women like you can get married

40:36.204 --> 40:38.538
if that's what you want.

40:40.208 --> 40:41.675
Okay.

40:44.112 --> 40:45.978
You told him I was gay.

40:45.979 --> 40:49.149
No, he assumed.
It's different. Right.

40:49.150 --> 40:50.905
Okay, let's begin.

40:50.906 --> 40:54.245
Feet shoulder width apart.
Relax your shoulders.

40:54.465 --> 40:56.766
He assumed?

40:56.800 --> 40:59.002
Just close your eyes and breathe.

40:59.036 --> 41:00.236
And breathe out.

41:00.271 --> 41:02.939
You better hope this calms me down.

41:02.973 --> 41:04.807
Well, I could always
tell him you like him.

41:04.842 --> 41:05.747
Don't you dare.

41:05.748 --> 41:07.227
Oh, I wouldn't dare. Shhhh!

41:08.000 --> 41:09.025
I'm sorry.

41:09.026 --> 41:10.326
Shhhhhh!

41:10.997 --> 41:12.391
I'm sorry.

41:12.392 --> 41:14.047
I'm sorry.
