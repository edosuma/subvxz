00:02.744 --> 00:05.340
<i>The seven wonders</i>
<i>of the world...</i>

00:06.090 --> 00:08.458
<i>Christ the redeemer...</i>

00:08.459 --> 00:11.260
<i>The Taj Mahal...</i>

00:11.261 --> 00:12.895
<i>The great pyramids...</i>

00:13.966 --> 00:17.002
<i>truly man's</i>
<i>greatest achievements.</i>

00:17.003 --> 00:20.338
<i>But there's one man</i>
<i>who sees them differently.</i>

00:20.716 --> 00:23.384
If that was on my road,
the council would be on it.

00:23.385 --> 00:25.019
They'd go, "Get that down.
It's a death trap."

00:27.891 --> 00:29.291
<i>Karl Pilkington.</i>

00:29.392 --> 00:32.060
It's like a pylon.

00:32.061 --> 00:34.930
I don't know
the politically correct term.

00:34.931 --> 00:36.565
"Moron," I think.

00:36.566 --> 00:42.404
He is a round, empty-headed,
chimp-like, manc moron.

00:42.405 --> 00:44.740
Buffoon, idiot.
Is that normal?

00:44.741 --> 00:46.842
And he's a friend.

00:46.843 --> 00:48.377
We've often described him
as being, like,

00:48.378 --> 00:49.778
some kind of real-life
Homer Simpson.

00:49.779 --> 00:53.115
Homer is small-minded,
petty,

00:53.116 --> 00:54.983
but, at his core,
a good person.

00:54.984 --> 00:56.718
And lovable.
Absolutely lovable.

00:56.719 --> 01:00.155
It's like a game of Jenga
that's got out of hand.

01:00.156 --> 01:01.423
I can't get enough of him.

01:01.424 --> 01:03.258
Is everyone
gonna be wearing this?

01:03.259 --> 01:04.626
He's a typical
little Englander,

01:04.626 --> 01:06.628
and he doesn't like going out
of his comfort zone.

01:06.629 --> 01:08.530
My bollocks are squashed.

01:08.531 --> 01:10.265
I just think
that it would be amazing

01:10.266 --> 01:11.700
to send him around the world.

01:11.701 --> 01:16.638
What we'd like to see is him
experience other cultures,

01:16.639 --> 01:19.808
other peoples
and see if, in any way,

01:19.809 --> 01:22.544
we can change his outlook
on the world.

01:22.545 --> 01:24.346
I've been
to many exotic places.

01:24.347 --> 01:26.114
I genuinely think travel
broadens the mind.

01:26.115 --> 01:27.783
I want him to hate it.

01:27.784 --> 01:30.986
I want him to hate every minute
of it for my own amusement.

01:30.987 --> 01:33.755
Nothing is funnier

01:33.756 --> 01:36.574
than Karl in a corner
being poked by a stick.

01:36.694 --> 01:37.862
I am that stick.

01:37.982 --> 01:41.371
And now I have the might
of Sky behind me.

01:43.758 --> 01:46.849
This is one of the funniest,
most expensive practical jokes

01:46.976 --> 01:49.722
I've ever done,
and it's gonna be great.

01:51.180 --> 01:53.490
Just let me go!
Jesus Christ.

<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:58.969 --> 02:00.470
All right?

02:00.471 --> 02:02.338
Yeah.

02:02.339 --> 02:03.417
I'm all right, yeah.

02:03.837 --> 02:05.304
What are we doing today?

02:05.305 --> 02:07.106
Just hanging around.

02:07.107 --> 02:09.642
You look nervous.
You look uneasy.

02:09.643 --> 02:11.310
I am a bit, yeah.
It's not normal, is it?

02:11.311 --> 02:12.478
What?
What isn't?

02:12.479 --> 02:13.613
You're asking me how me day is

02:13.614 --> 02:15.581
in a room full of people
I don't know.

02:15.582 --> 02:17.283
Yeah.

02:17.284 --> 02:18.718
Well, you're gonna
get to know them.

02:18.719 --> 02:20.353
You're gonna get to know them
really well.

02:20.354 --> 02:22.155
What, everywhere I go,
these lot are coming, are they?

02:22.156 --> 02:23.990
Yeah. Well, they've got to.
They got to film it.

02:23.991 --> 02:25.992
Otherwise,
you'd be by yourself,

02:25.993 --> 02:29.228
and we wouldn't see it
on the telly.

02:29.229 --> 02:31.197
Right, Karl.

02:31.198 --> 02:34.068
I'm very jealous
of your trip here, Karl,

02:34.069 --> 02:36.203
to the mighty
Great Wall of China.

02:36.204 --> 02:37.371
Well, you say that,
but how come I'm going

02:37.372 --> 02:39.306
and you're not doing any?

02:39.307 --> 02:41.642
Well, because, um...
We're executive producers.

02:41.643 --> 02:44.945
Yeah, we're busy.
We've got other stuff going on.

02:44.946 --> 02:46.247
So, out of all the places,

02:46.248 --> 02:48.516
this is the place
that I'm worried about most.

02:48.517 --> 02:50.184
Why?

02:50.185 --> 02:52.720
Just the way they live.
They're different.

02:52.721 --> 02:54.655
What, Chinese people?

02:54.656 --> 02:56.223
They just wreck everything.

02:56.224 --> 02:57.825
They make everything weird.

02:57.826 --> 02:59.160
That's what I'm worried about.

02:59.161 --> 03:00.494
To you. To you.
I don't understand what you mean.

03:00.495 --> 03:02.830
Everything... chicken.
Why is it orange in Chinatown?

03:04.833 --> 03:08.102
Just the slightest thing.
The chicken is orange.

03:08.103 --> 03:11.439
Anything. Know what I mean?
Octopus.

03:11.440 --> 03:13.841
Toad.

03:13.842 --> 03:15.843
He just made that one up!

03:15.844 --> 03:19.847
No, say if I go over there.
I have a bit of toad.

03:19.848 --> 03:21.682
I go, "Do you know what?
Quite nice.

03:21.683 --> 03:23.384
That's nicer than chicken."
Yeah.

03:23.385 --> 03:24.552
It's gonna be pretty tough

03:24.553 --> 03:26.554
to get a bit of grilled toad
in this country.

03:26.555 --> 03:28.289
It could make me
sort of wish for stuff

03:28.290 --> 03:29.824
that I can no longer
get ahold of.

03:29.825 --> 03:31.892
Have you been listening to what
he's been saying there?

03:31.893 --> 03:33.027
That he's scared to go to China

03:33.028 --> 03:34.395
in case he gets a taste
for toad.

03:34.396 --> 03:35.996
And then comes back
and can't get toad.

03:35.997 --> 03:38.165
So I just wanted to check that you heard that.
Yeah.

03:38.166 --> 03:39.467
The way they write...
the letters are weird.

03:39.468 --> 03:41.068
Their alphabet's not like ours.

03:41.069 --> 03:45.206
That is like...
like someone testing out a biro.

03:45.207 --> 03:46.373
Everything's...

03:46.374 --> 03:48.075
There's no logic
to anything that they do.

03:48.076 --> 03:50.110
There i... there is!

03:50.111 --> 03:51.479
Of course
there's a logic to it!

03:51.480 --> 03:52.913
The way they read a book,
it's all the other way around...

03:52.914 --> 03:55.316
From back to front
instead of front to back

03:55.317 --> 03:56.417
and up and down.

03:56.418 --> 03:57.885
Everything that we've done,
they've gone,

03:57.886 --> 03:59.186
"Right.
We're gonna do it weirder."

04:00.188 --> 04:01.889
That's how it comes across.

04:01.890 --> 04:04.391
Well, some would say
that they did it first.

04:04.392 --> 04:06.160
Their civilization beat ours

04:06.161 --> 04:10.331
by many, many hundreds of years,
but, anyway...

04:10.332 --> 04:11.966
Right. Off you go.

04:11.967 --> 04:14.602
See you when you get back.

04:14.603 --> 04:16.504
All right. See ya.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here

04:35.357 --> 04:39.527
A bit gray, isn't it?

04:39.528 --> 04:42.363
Is today a cloudy day,
or is this pollution?

04:42.364 --> 04:45.032
It's not worth having this
in HD, is it?

04:45.033 --> 04:47.201
Nothing looks crisp.

04:47.202 --> 04:50.070
Everything's sort of hazy.

04:50.071 --> 04:52.740
Like some sort of Kate Bush
video or something.

04:53.942 --> 04:55.743
Can anyone speak English?

04:55.744 --> 04:57.077
Does he want to give us a lift?

04:57.078 --> 04:59.246
English? Do you
want to give us a ride?

04:59.247 --> 05:00.714
Okay.
Yeah, yeah.

05:12.527 --> 05:14.261
Hi.

05:14.262 --> 05:16.664
Doesn't seem to work
when you smile at people.

05:16.665 --> 05:19.166
Nothing. Nothing.
Blank.

05:19.167 --> 05:22.303
So I don't know if smiling
means smiling here.

05:22.304 --> 05:24.505
I mean, if they don't
understand me language

05:24.506 --> 05:26.173
and they don't understand
me expressions,

05:26.174 --> 05:28.042
I don't know what I've got
to communicate with.

05:28.043 --> 05:29.710
Hi.

05:29.711 --> 05:31.745
Nothing. Nothing.
I got nothing then.

05:31.746 --> 05:35.115
I don't think I've ever
felt this lost.

05:35.116 --> 05:36.584
Even in Wales.

05:36.585 --> 05:40.821
See what I mean here, though,
about things not being normal?

05:40.822 --> 05:43.324
You know, I get off a plane all
sort of aching and jet-lagged.

05:43.325 --> 05:45.926
I thought, "I know. I'll have
a massage. That'll be nice."

05:45.927 --> 05:47.227
Massage.
Massage?

05:47.228 --> 05:48.362
Hai.

05:48.363 --> 05:49.763
I'm never gonna get
to where I'm going.

05:49.764 --> 05:52.132
I haven't been to bed yet.
It is nice, though, to be fair.

05:52.133 --> 05:54.602
That isn't...
that isn't good.

05:54.603 --> 05:57.004
Ha ha!

05:57.839 --> 05:58.872
Ha ha!

06:00.542 --> 06:02.276
Ha ha!

06:02.277 --> 06:03.444
Ha ha.

06:03.445 --> 06:05.479
Hell. I mean, what...
was that a massage?

06:05.480 --> 06:07.514
I don't know.
Or was I just being mugged?

06:07.515 --> 06:09.683
Ha ha! Ho!

06:12.721 --> 06:14.722
Well, I'm just
trying to find the hotel

06:14.723 --> 06:17.391
that Ricky and Steve
have sorted out for me.

06:17.392 --> 06:20.828
I'm not expecting that much,
if I'm honest with you.

06:20.829 --> 06:22.496
I've got a room.
Pilkington.

06:23.932 --> 06:24.932
Nice.

06:24.933 --> 06:28.235
It's compact, isn't it?
Yes.

06:28.236 --> 06:30.437
It's cozy.
It feels chinesey.

06:30.438 --> 06:31.572
Yeah, it is.

06:31.573 --> 06:32.740
Those slippers...
They're mine?

06:32.741 --> 06:33.741
Mm-hmm.

06:33.742 --> 06:35.376
Quite Chinese, aren't they?

06:35.377 --> 06:36.877
Behind the cloth,
you have a TV.

06:36.878 --> 06:38.045
Any English?

06:38.046 --> 06:39.580
No. Only Chinese.

06:39.581 --> 06:41.649
Okay.
Thanks. Ta.

06:43.685 --> 06:45.719
Quite like this touch.

06:45.720 --> 06:47.054
Suzanne wants a fish,

06:47.055 --> 06:49.323
so I'll have to let her know
that I've got a couple.

06:49.324 --> 06:50.991
I mean, that is for sort of
company, isn't it?

06:50.992 --> 06:54.228
It's not... it's not some sort
of appetizer, that, is it?

06:54.229 --> 06:55.996
That's handy.

06:55.997 --> 07:00.100
You know, I said the Chinese
always come up with inventions.

07:00.101 --> 07:03.137
They're quite futuristic
with their ideas.

07:03.138 --> 07:05.806
That's all right, isn't it?
Little radio with headlights.

07:05.807 --> 07:07.975
I don't know
when you'd need that.

07:07.976 --> 07:10.678
I mean,
the whole beauty of radio is,

07:10.679 --> 07:13.580
you know, you can listen to it
in the dark.

07:13.581 --> 07:14.915
I mean, if that was
on the "Dragons' Den,"

07:14.916 --> 07:18.385
you'd say, "I'm out,"
wouldn't you?

07:21.356 --> 07:22.856
I'm just gonna go and have
a wander about, I think,

07:22.857 --> 07:25.192
'cause there's nothing else
to do, so I might as well,

07:25.193 --> 07:26.760
you know, at least try and see
a bit of the place,

07:26.761 --> 07:28.195
mix with the locals.

07:28.196 --> 07:31.565
And, you know, that's what
Ricky and Steve want, isn't it?

07:31.566 --> 07:32.766
They want to see
how I can handle meself

07:32.767 --> 07:35.803
with some foreigners.

07:37.172 --> 07:38.605
- Karl.
- "Ka."

07:38.606 --> 07:41.008
"Kar."
"Ka."

07:41.009 --> 07:42.176
"Kar."
Karl.

07:42.177 --> 07:43.510
Yeah.
"L"... Karl.

07:43.511 --> 07:45.612
"Karla." "Karla."
Karl.

07:45.613 --> 07:47.715
Not "Karla."
Just "Karl."

07:47.716 --> 07:49.416
Karl.
Oh, Karl, Karl. Yeah.

07:49.417 --> 07:51.218
Karl.
Karl.

07:51.219 --> 07:52.219
Karl?
"Karlo."

07:52.220 --> 07:53.887
No. No, no. No.

07:53.888 --> 07:55.222
"Kar."
No.

07:55.223 --> 07:57.891
Karl.
"Karlo."

07:57.892 --> 07:59.460
You don't need to add...

07:59.461 --> 08:01.962
Like this in your country...
the "shasha be-ya."

08:01.963 --> 08:04.164
"Shasha be-ya." You look.
"Shasha be-ya."

08:04.165 --> 08:06.133
"Shasha be-ya."
"Shas be-ya."

08:06.134 --> 08:07.601
Yeah. Chinese...

08:07.602 --> 08:10.938
Shakespeare.
"Shas-ber."

08:10.939 --> 08:12.673
Good!

08:12.674 --> 08:13.841
Yeah, "Hamlet."

08:13.842 --> 08:15.843
It's just breaking it up
a little bit.

08:15.844 --> 08:17.010
"Karl."
Yeah, yeah.

08:17.011 --> 08:18.278
I'm Kar-l-l.

08:18.279 --> 08:19.446
"Kar."

08:19.447 --> 08:21.615
It's not "Kar."
It's "Karl."

08:25.320 --> 08:28.655
Yeah, it smells more chinesey,
now, doesn't it?

08:28.656 --> 08:30.991
Sort of sweet and sour.

08:33.794 --> 08:36.296
That's good, isn't it?
It's not dead.

08:36.297 --> 08:38.432
That's dead, isn't it?

08:38.433 --> 08:41.001
Are they dead?
Are they toads?

08:41.001 --> 08:44.037
So, I don't get it.
Are they alive in that bag?

08:44.038 --> 08:45.739
Yeah.

08:45.740 --> 08:46.940
Why aren't they legging it?

08:46.941 --> 08:49.276
He's got, like,
a Sainsbury's bag full of toads.

08:49.277 --> 08:50.511
He rips them out,
cuts their head off,

08:50.512 --> 08:51.879
sticks them in another bin bag.

08:51.880 --> 08:53.180
I don't even know what that is.

08:53.181 --> 08:55.516
I mean, it looks like
a load of condoms

08:55.517 --> 08:57.217
in jam and water or something.

08:57.218 --> 08:58.852
I mean, it's weird
how he's got it sat there

08:58.853 --> 09:00.220
as if that's meant
to tempt you in.

09:02.757 --> 09:04.324
Well, the idea was, you know,

09:04.325 --> 09:06.994
that I'd nip out,
get a little snack

09:06.995 --> 09:08.428
'cause Ricky and Steve said,
"Yeah, try everything out.

09:08.429 --> 09:10.297
You know,
do what the locals do,"

09:10.298 --> 09:12.166
but there's no way
I'm eating this stuff.

09:13.935 --> 09:18.472
Scorpion, sea horse, cockroach,
silkworm, caterpillar.

09:18.473 --> 09:19.807
This looks like
they custard creams on a stick,

09:19.808 --> 09:22.142
as well, at the end.

09:22.143 --> 09:24.812
Just anything on a stick.
Whatever you want on a stick.

09:26.915 --> 09:28.982
I just don't understand
why they're eating all this.

09:28.983 --> 09:32.452
I mean, at home, restaurants
would get closed down

09:32.453 --> 09:33.887
for having a cockroach
in the kitchen.

09:33.888 --> 09:36.123
Yet here, it's a starter.

09:36.124 --> 09:37.858
I didn't know it'd be like this.

09:37.859 --> 09:40.027
I didn't think it'd be
this mental, really,

09:40.028 --> 09:42.362
in the food department.

09:42.363 --> 09:45.332
There's a woman over there
just tucking in on a...

09:45.333 --> 09:47.034
Bunch of scorpions.

09:47.035 --> 09:49.837
It's kind of like she's just
having a bit of a chicken leg.

09:49.838 --> 09:53.006
Not a problem. Just...
just shoving them in her face.

09:53.007 --> 09:55.609
She looks at it
before she puts it in her mouth

09:55.610 --> 09:57.878
like, "Oh, yeah.
Which bit will I have first?

09:57.879 --> 09:59.379
The head or the ass?"

09:59.380 --> 10:01.215
I mean, as she's eating one
off one stick,

10:01.216 --> 10:02.549
she's looking
at the other stick.

10:02.550 --> 10:04.151
She can't get enough of them.
Her eyes...

10:04.152 --> 10:05.586
It's like
they're doughnuts to her.

10:05.587 --> 10:06.987
She's looking at them,
she's going,

10:06.988 --> 10:08.655
"Oh, look at that one there.
That one looks nice."

10:08.656 --> 10:10.757
You see,
I don't know where it stops.

10:10.758 --> 10:13.927
Where's the line
between food and insect?

10:13.928 --> 10:16.163
If she gets up in the morning,

10:16.164 --> 10:18.165
there's a spider in the bath,
what does she do?

10:18.166 --> 10:20.267
"Oh, good. I'll leave
the croissant for tomorrow.

10:20.268 --> 10:23.270
I'll eat that now."

10:25.006 --> 10:27.007
What's he eating?

10:27.008 --> 10:31.011
Oh, God.
What sort of egg is that?

10:31.012 --> 10:34.615
No, it's a fetus...
Inside an egg.

10:34.616 --> 10:36.750
A fetus?

10:39.287 --> 10:41.722
I don't want any.

10:41.723 --> 10:43.657
Just for people watching
who don't know, he's with us,

10:43.658 --> 10:46.760
you know, helping drive the bus
and what have you.

10:46.761 --> 10:49.463
He seems like a normal bloke.

10:49.464 --> 10:51.164
I mean, eating a fetus.

10:51.165 --> 10:54.234
Not even waiting
for the thing to be born

10:54.235 --> 10:56.870
and to live a bit
and then eat it.

10:56.871 --> 10:58.171
I mean, a fetus.

11:00.842 --> 11:03.577
Only been here for a bit,
I'm running out of these.

11:03.578 --> 11:05.178
I got three more packets left.

11:05.179 --> 11:07.614
But, you know,
the weird thing is,

11:07.615 --> 11:09.216
I'm the freak here, aren't I?

11:09.217 --> 11:11.852
Everyone else is eating that.
I'm eating these.

11:11.853 --> 11:13.020
I'm the odd one out.

11:18.760 --> 11:23.931
Had my name done.
That says "Karl."

11:23.932 --> 11:26.266
Could be that way.
Could be that way.

11:26.267 --> 11:28.535
I don't know.
It's one or the other.

11:28.536 --> 11:30.704
Could be that way.
Let's face it.

11:30.705 --> 11:32.739
I don't know.
Could be any way.

11:32.740 --> 11:35.108
I'm sure if you, you know...
If you're Chinese

11:35.109 --> 11:36.376
and you're watching this,

11:36.377 --> 11:38.412
you know if I got it
the right way up.

11:38.413 --> 11:43.050
There you go.
That says "Karl."

11:43.051 --> 11:45.385
I mean, I haven't got Suzanne
a gift yet.

11:45.386 --> 11:46.820
I could just give her this

11:46.821 --> 11:49.489
and say, "Yeah, it says 'Suzanne, ' that."

11:49.490 --> 11:51.658
She wouldn't know.

11:58.665 --> 12:01.667
Well, I'm here
to see the Great Wall, aren't I?

12:01.668 --> 12:03.464
You know, one of the wonders
of the world,

12:03.465 --> 12:05.799
but I'm just not in the mood,
honestly.

12:05.800 --> 12:09.670
I'm still knackered.
I'm still jet-lagged.

12:09.671 --> 12:12.339
And just...
just the weirdness of China.

12:12.340 --> 12:13.674
That tires you out, too.

12:15.343 --> 12:17.778
What's all the noise out there?

12:20.248 --> 12:22.482
It's like 1:00 in the morning
at home.

12:22.483 --> 12:25.085
I've got a message.

12:45.740 --> 12:47.574
All right, enjoy.

12:47.575 --> 12:50.744
Do people
really believe that here?

12:50.745 --> 12:55.415
I mean, are people taking kids
in and saying to him,

12:55.416 --> 12:57.784
"Right, here's me kid.

12:57.785 --> 12:59.353
What's his future
gonna be like?"

12:59.354 --> 13:01.922
'Cause his life is gonna be
a load of shit anyway.

13:01.923 --> 13:03.924
End it. Do him a favor.

13:03.925 --> 13:05.792
But then it doesn't always
work like that.

13:05.793 --> 13:07.227
That's what I mean with fate.

13:07.228 --> 13:09.629
I didn't do that well at school.
I left with an "e" in history.

13:09.630 --> 13:11.331
So, see,
if my dad knew that, he'd go,

13:11.332 --> 13:13.767
"Right, get the brick,"
and that would be the end of it.

13:13.768 --> 13:15.268
Whereas I've done all right.

13:15.269 --> 13:18.605
I've got a job.
I'm paying me way in life.

13:20.074 --> 13:22.743
I have got a bit
of a problem with this.

13:22.744 --> 13:25.212
A mate has sent me
to have this done.

13:25.213 --> 13:27.314
I'm not happy about it, really.

13:27.315 --> 13:30.317
I sort of think
I'm better off not knowing.

13:30.318 --> 13:32.352
If something bad's
gonna happen,

13:32.353 --> 13:34.788
I'd prefer it just to happen
without having a warning.

13:36.591 --> 13:37.924
Time... time I was born.

13:39.627 --> 13:42.129
A palm pilot. I didn't expect
him to have a palm pilot.

13:42.130 --> 13:43.563
Quite futuristic.

13:45.500 --> 13:48.335
Do you know
who Bruce Springsteen is?

13:48.336 --> 13:50.103
He's got the same birth date
as me.

13:52.240 --> 13:54.341
I don't know
what you're talking about.

13:54.342 --> 13:56.209
I'm concentrating
on calculating your future.

13:56.210 --> 13:58.412
All right.

14:05.052 --> 14:07.387
You have to pay attention
to your health

14:07.388 --> 14:10.023
because you've got
some sort of heart problem.

14:10.024 --> 14:12.192
Oh, here we go.

14:12.193 --> 14:15.695
What sort of heart problem?

14:15.696 --> 14:18.532
Something to do
with your heart blood vessel.

14:18.533 --> 14:22.702
It's weird, that, 'cause me dad
had a problem with his heart.

14:22.703 --> 14:24.771
And they say
it runs in the family.

14:24.772 --> 14:26.907
So is it gonna kill me, then?

14:29.177 --> 14:30.444
90%.

14:30.445 --> 14:31.812
90%?

14:31.813 --> 14:33.146
Mm.

14:33.147 --> 14:37.784
Brilliant.

14:37.785 --> 14:40.053
But maybe we can change it.

14:40.054 --> 14:42.889
Although you have
some health problem,

14:42.890 --> 14:45.892
we're gonna do
a ceremony for you.

14:45.893 --> 14:47.861
But you do need to write
a confession

14:47.862 --> 14:49.162
about what you did wrong.

14:49.163 --> 14:51.331
Something I did wrong.

14:51.332 --> 14:53.500
Something I did wrong
in the past.

14:53.501 --> 14:54.968
Mm.

14:54.969 --> 14:56.303
Did wrong.

15:01.642 --> 15:04.978
You need to write
three confessions

15:04.979 --> 15:07.080
on those three pieces of paper.

15:07.081 --> 15:08.548
All right.

15:10.251 --> 15:12.719
When I lived in the other flat,

15:12.720 --> 15:15.822
there was a fellow who used to
live in it called Bruce,

15:15.823 --> 15:19.259
and he used to get his post,
and I'd open it.

15:19.260 --> 15:20.660
It was his old flat.

15:20.661 --> 15:23.763
I kept getting posts for him
years after he'd moved out.

15:23.764 --> 15:25.999
See, it's meant to be bad,
though, isn't it?

15:26.000 --> 15:29.336
Carl Grimshaw...
I put putty in his hair,

15:29.337 --> 15:31.671
and he had to
have his head shaved.

15:31.672 --> 15:33.507
That's a bit tight, wasn't it?

15:33.508 --> 15:35.842
And he had a funny-shaped head,
so he looked really bad.

15:35.843 --> 15:37.544
I'll put that down.

15:37.545 --> 15:43.416
Carl Grimshaw
for putting putty in his hair.

15:43.417 --> 15:46.586
So, I worked at
this bloke's shop, called Bob.

15:46.587 --> 15:49.723
I was his best paperboy.

15:49.724 --> 15:51.258
So I'd collate all me papers,

15:51.259 --> 15:53.226
get them all...
get them all ready,

15:53.227 --> 15:54.327
stick them in me bag.

15:54.328 --> 15:55.695
When he wasn't looking,

15:55.696 --> 15:58.298
I'd just sort of take a Mars
bar, slip it up me sleeve.

15:58.299 --> 15:59.633
Off we go.

15:59.634 --> 16:05.138
So, every day, seven a week
for about...Two years.

16:05.139 --> 16:08.141
Lot of Mars bars. I know that.
That's why it's on here.

16:08.142 --> 16:10.277
It's always been playing
on me mind, that.

16:10.278 --> 16:12.112
'Cause I since found out
that shop

16:12.113 --> 16:14.681
doesn't make that much money
from delivering papers.

16:14.682 --> 16:16.449
Hiya.

16:20.488 --> 16:23.323
This is a healing process.

16:24.892 --> 16:28.128
Now everything gonna be fine.

16:28.129 --> 16:31.898
The other two papers, one needs
to be put on top of a mountain.

16:31.899 --> 16:35.402
The other one
needs to be put in the sea.

16:35.403 --> 16:37.904
It will help you
to cleanse your soul.

16:37.905 --> 16:41.641
Again, thanks a lot.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.980
Just give us a second.

16:46.981 --> 16:48.682
Give us a sec.

16:53.988 --> 16:56.957
You are kidding me.

16:56.958 --> 16:59.793
You seen this?

16:59.794 --> 17:03.463
See the things?
There's no doors or anything.

17:03.464 --> 17:04.664
Soon as you open the door,

17:04.665 --> 17:06.633
you could just get
a full view of someone.

17:06.634 --> 17:08.233
I mean, if it was here,

17:08.234 --> 17:10.436
it's more understandable,
isn't it?

17:10.438 --> 17:11.972
Because if you sat here,

17:11.973 --> 17:15.541
and at least people come in and
you'd go, "So I'm in this one."

17:15.542 --> 17:18.444
It's a bit weird
to just sort of wander in and...

17:18.445 --> 17:20.213
I mean, they've made this bit.

17:20.214 --> 17:22.882
Why not just finish it up
with a door on it?

17:22.883 --> 17:26.118
They've done the hard bit.
Couple of hinges and a door.

17:26.119 --> 17:27.787
And there's no toilet paper.

17:27.788 --> 17:28.955
What do they do?

17:28.956 --> 17:31.558
Do they just pull up their pants
and walk off?

17:31.559 --> 17:32.859
Is that what you do?

17:32.860 --> 17:35.228
I'm not here to say they
should be using toilet paper.

17:35.229 --> 17:36.496
It's not right.

17:36.497 --> 17:38.264
If that's not what they do,
that's not what they do.

17:38.265 --> 17:39.933
But it's just...
I didn't know that.

17:39.934 --> 17:42.135
I didn't think China
was gonna be like this.

17:42.136 --> 17:43.903
I thought
it was gonna be more...

17:43.904 --> 17:46.573
Like I said, I thought it was
where they made the iPod.

17:46.574 --> 17:48.108
I think I've got the wrong place

17:48.109 --> 17:50.610
because this ain't a place
where they need an iPod.

17:50.611 --> 17:51.878
Have a toilet roll first.

17:51.879 --> 17:53.079
I mean, it's weird.

17:53.080 --> 17:55.548
'Cause whenever
you buy stuff like that,

17:55.549 --> 17:58.418
toilet rollovers and stuff,
it says "Made in China."

17:58.419 --> 18:00.153
Why ain't they using them, then?

18:00.154 --> 18:02.489
That's odd, isn't it?

18:02.490 --> 18:04.424
So he's got to leave the house,
he's got to go,

18:04.425 --> 18:05.592
"Do I feel like one today?

18:05.593 --> 18:07.460
"I might do.
I have a bit of a dicky belly.

18:07.461 --> 18:09.496
I best get me seat."
Everyone who's walking past

18:09.497 --> 18:11.698
knows he's gonna have a shit
at some point today.

18:11.699 --> 18:13.199
I wouldn't like that.

18:19.373 --> 18:21.875
Do you know, like, how when I go
into a public toilet,

18:21.876 --> 18:23.743
you like to nip in with a coin
and open the door?

18:26.113 --> 18:27.847
Yeah, well,
you couldn't do that here

18:27.848 --> 18:29.582
'cause there no doors
on the toilets.

18:31.919 --> 18:34.754
They were filming some stuff
on the street,

18:34.755 --> 18:36.756
just, like, traffic and stuff.

18:36.757 --> 18:38.458
I said,
"I'm just nipping in here."

18:38.459 --> 18:40.627
Walked in, was greeted
by two fellas squatting.

18:41.729 --> 18:43.263
They were chefs from the place
on the corner,

18:43.264 --> 18:44.397
so that's...
that's reassuring.

18:45.366 --> 18:46.499
Honest to God.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.702
One of them was on the phone
taking an order.

18:48.703 --> 18:51.538
It was... it was really...

18:51.539 --> 18:53.006
I've never seen
anything like it.

18:53.007 --> 18:54.841
I don't think I could ever
get used to that.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.843
You need to have your own space
when doing that,

18:56.844 --> 18:58.678
and they're just there.
One's on the phone,

18:58.679 --> 19:00.513
the other one's just sort of
looking 'round.

19:02.516 --> 19:03.750
Yeah.
Oh.

19:10.524 --> 19:12.525
Well, it looked like he was
sort of saying,

19:12.526 --> 19:14.661
"I'll have it ready in, like,
about five min...

19:14.662 --> 19:17.330
Oh, no, give me 10."

19:20.301 --> 19:21.935
Or a "king-poo" chicken.

19:24.271 --> 19:25.905
No.

19:31.531 --> 19:33.948
Yeah, well, I'm seeing
the Great Wall today, aren't I?

19:34.546 --> 19:37.214
Ricky and Steve just said,
"Get down to the bus depot,"

19:37.215 --> 19:39.216
where there's loads
of coaches and that,

19:39.217 --> 19:41.719
which, you know...
I'm not looking forward to this.

19:41.720 --> 19:43.387
Pilkington, Pilkington.

19:43.388 --> 19:45.923
You know, I mean, getting on
a bus full of tourists

19:45.924 --> 19:48.492
with a fella stood
at the front, yapping on,

19:48.493 --> 19:50.694
you know,
with loads of history facts

19:50.695 --> 19:53.897
and just loads of stuff that
you're never gonna remember.

19:53.898 --> 19:56.734
Is there an English bus?
English tour?

19:56.735 --> 19:58.636
Do you not understand?

19:58.637 --> 20:01.538
Ricky and Steve
just said come here.

20:07.012 --> 20:09.480
Sorry. Sorry.

20:09.481 --> 20:10.814
Thanks a lot.
Hello.

20:22.761 --> 20:26.130
It's a bit of
a pointless exercise, really.

20:26.131 --> 20:27.431
It's pointless.

20:27.432 --> 20:30.501
Stuck in here
with a daft hat on,

20:30.502 --> 20:33.704
not understanding
what's going on.

20:33.705 --> 20:35.673
I mean, this woman's
friendly enough.

20:35.674 --> 20:37.875
But even she's sort of
blanking in and out.

20:51.623 --> 20:54.358
Yeah, the fella behind me
is coughing his guts up.

20:54.359 --> 20:56.827
I thought I was putting on
a waterproof coat

20:56.828 --> 20:57.928
in case it rained.

20:57.929 --> 20:59.596
I need it just for on this bus.

21:00.999 --> 21:02.232
Why do they do that?

21:07.238 --> 21:08.639
There's the wall.

21:12.243 --> 21:15.379
I can't see it now anyway,
so it'll be a surprise for me.

21:16.681 --> 21:19.750
How long does it take
to get there?

21:26.991 --> 21:30.060
Feel like I'm at the post office
on O.A.P. day.

21:30.061 --> 21:32.830
Wonder of the world.

21:32.831 --> 21:35.733
A wonder of the world.

21:40.638 --> 21:41.772
Well...

21:43.975 --> 21:47.444
Look at everyone,
pushing and shoving.

21:48.913 --> 21:50.047
This is it, then.

21:52.283 --> 21:57.588
"It was heavily restored
in both the 1950s and 1980s."

21:59.924 --> 22:02.059
I didn't know that.

22:02.060 --> 22:03.460
Not even old bricks?

22:03.461 --> 22:05.395
Am I missing something here?

22:05.396 --> 22:08.031
So the old stuff's
gone on it, really.

22:08.032 --> 22:12.336
But then it doesn't count.
It shouldn't be a wonder, then.

22:12.337 --> 22:14.037
You can't just build something
on it and still,

22:14.038 --> 22:15.339
you know,
get all the tourists in

22:15.340 --> 22:17.474
when it's not what it says
on the tin.

22:17.475 --> 22:21.645
What I'm looking at
is basically a wimpy home.

22:21.646 --> 22:24.047
You know, you can see it
for miles...

22:24.048 --> 22:27.017
Goes on for miles over the hills
and everything,

22:27.018 --> 22:28.218
but so does the M6.

22:28.219 --> 22:29.653
Do you know what I mean?

22:29.654 --> 22:32.456
You can see that for miles
and you go, "Great,"

22:32.457 --> 22:33.757
and that does a job.

22:33.758 --> 22:35.159
You can drive on that.

22:41.833 --> 22:43.901
Got bears in here.

22:43.902 --> 22:46.236
What's this all about, though?

22:46.237 --> 22:49.940
It's almost like they know
that the wall isn't that good,

22:49.941 --> 22:51.809
"So what else can we give them?

22:51.810 --> 22:54.344
"We've charged them like 7 quid
to get in to see an old wall.

22:54.345 --> 22:57.114
It's not an old wall.
It's from the 1980s."

22:57.115 --> 22:58.982
"I've got a mate
who's got some bears."

22:58.983 --> 23:01.051
"Yeah, yeah.
Stick them down at the bottom."

23:01.052 --> 23:03.654
There you are.
Look at him... Stood up.

23:03.655 --> 23:05.722
Evolution.

23:05.723 --> 23:07.524
Driver's getting involved,
chucking it food

23:07.525 --> 23:08.992
'cause he's not into apple,
is he.

23:08.993 --> 23:10.561
I've seen what he likes eating.

23:10.562 --> 23:13.397
If that was some sort of squid
with a tumor on its head,

23:13.398 --> 23:15.098
he'd be tucking in to it.

23:15.099 --> 23:16.934
He's not into fruit.

23:16.935 --> 23:19.102
So, really, I fancy getting
in there and getting a mouthful.

23:19.103 --> 23:22.012
It's the first normal food
I've seen since I've been here.

23:24.475 --> 23:27.544
You have one new message.

23:50.111 --> 23:51.812
What's the point of that?

23:57.270 --> 23:58.966
Yeah, just... just a bit
annoyed today

23:58.967 --> 24:01.574
'cause, you know, I thought I'd
seen the Great Wall of China,

24:01.575 --> 24:04.310
which, being honest with you,
it's not the Great Wall.

24:04.318 --> 24:05.574
It's an all right wall.

24:05.775 --> 24:06.819
It's the
"all right" wall of China.

24:07.647 --> 24:09.415
But, you know,
I thought I'd seen it.

24:09.416 --> 24:12.418
And then Steve calls up
with some bright idea, saying,

24:12.419 --> 24:14.486
"Oh, I want you to see
more of it.

24:14.487 --> 24:16.722
In fact, I want you to see
all of it."

24:16.723 --> 24:17.790
It's just stupid.

24:20.126 --> 24:22.961
You have one new message.

24:44.884 --> 24:46.952
Are they having a laugh?

24:50.490 --> 24:53.292
This isn't
the Great Wall, is it?

24:53.293 --> 24:54.827
You're kidding me.

24:54.828 --> 24:58.430
I mean, I like the way
there's no tourists and that.

24:58.431 --> 25:03.769
But then, why would there be?

25:03.770 --> 25:06.805
This is the original wall,
isn't it.

25:06.806 --> 25:10.142
Or is it? I don't know.
Is it just badly done?

25:10.143 --> 25:11.810
This is pretty shit, isn't it?

25:11.811 --> 25:14.613
You're meant to be able to
see it from the moon,

25:14.614 --> 25:17.382
aren't you, the Great Wall?

25:17.383 --> 25:18.684
Would you want to?

25:18.685 --> 25:22.788
Neil Armstrong getting
his binoculars out.

25:22.789 --> 25:25.390
"I be seeing it
from up here, Buzz."

25:25.391 --> 25:27.326
Jesus.

25:30.396 --> 25:33.031
And the fortune teller told me

25:33.032 --> 25:35.834
that, you know, I had to get rid
of one of me sins on a mountain,

25:35.835 --> 25:39.471
so I might as well do it
whilst I'm up here.

25:40.673 --> 25:43.208
That was the one
about Carl Grimshaw

25:43.209 --> 25:45.177
getting putty in his hair.

25:45.178 --> 25:48.013
But, you know,
it's worth doing, isn't it?

25:48.014 --> 25:50.149
If it means I'm not gonna have
a heart attack.

25:55.973 --> 25:57.603
Well, I've been
traveling for three days.

25:58.381 --> 26:00.582
I've walked miles.
And let's face it.

26:00.583 --> 26:02.467
There's only so much time
you can look at anything,

26:02.563 --> 26:04.714
and the only reason I've come
to this bit of the wall

26:04.715 --> 26:07.249
is because Steve said there was
a little village close by,

26:07.250 --> 26:10.051
and he knows someone who's gonna
sort some dinner out.

26:11.520 --> 26:14.189
Ni hao.
Ni hao.

26:14.190 --> 26:15.190
Ni hao.

26:15.191 --> 26:16.591
Are you all right?

26:19.595 --> 26:20.862
He's a big lad.

26:22.965 --> 26:24.566
Um...

26:24.567 --> 26:27.302
Just... just... just a little,
little bit.

26:27.303 --> 26:30.138
Little bit.
Not big.

26:30.139 --> 26:31.840
Uh, full.

26:31.841 --> 26:34.709
Well, they seem like
nice people.

26:34.710 --> 26:36.177
And I can tell that just...

26:36.178 --> 26:38.914
Even though I can't speak
their language and stuff.

26:38.915 --> 26:40.348
Got some food for me.

26:40.349 --> 26:42.484
It's nice,
but it's just a bit awkward

26:42.485 --> 26:45.553
if there's something I don't
like in it because I can't...

26:45.554 --> 26:46.888
you know, you can have...

26:46.889 --> 26:50.025
You can use your hands
to say certain things,

26:50.026 --> 26:53.528
but what can you do
if it's something I don't like?

26:53.529 --> 26:56.665
I can't sort of make a lie up.

26:56.666 --> 26:58.633
What is that?

26:58.634 --> 27:00.201
What is that?

27:00.202 --> 27:03.238
Right, forget it.

27:03.239 --> 27:05.640
Forget it.

27:05.641 --> 27:08.009
It's fucking hell.
They're massive toads.

27:08.010 --> 27:09.678
Yeah, it's toads
in a courier bag.

27:11.080 --> 27:14.916
Oh, I looked at the wrong time!

27:14.917 --> 27:17.819
I didn't really want to look,
but when I turned around,

27:17.820 --> 27:20.155
it looked like she was
having a wrestle with one.

27:20.156 --> 27:23.358
Then I heard, like, doof! Doof!

27:23.359 --> 27:25.527
So I'm guessing the toad
wasn't winning.

27:25.528 --> 27:27.495
And I've been told
it tastes like chicken,

27:27.496 --> 27:29.130
so I should just eat it
and think,

27:29.131 --> 27:30.999
"Yeah, it's chicken.
It's chicken.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.500
Just nice chicken."

27:32.501 --> 27:34.569
Why did she have to
cave its head in out here?

27:34.570 --> 27:37.539
Why couldn't she just do it inside
somewhere and then I'd eat it?

27:37.540 --> 27:39.574
Tell me after.

27:39.575 --> 27:41.309
All right, yeah, I'll...
in a minute.

27:41.310 --> 27:43.011
If they knew we were coming,

27:43.012 --> 27:45.146
couldn't they have just
got something normal?

27:45.147 --> 27:46.581
Why didn't you say to them,

27:46.582 --> 27:49.050
"Now, is it all right
if we bring Karl around,

27:49.051 --> 27:50.185
cook him something?"

27:50.186 --> 27:51.820
"Yeah, yeah.
Of course you can, yeah.

27:51.821 --> 27:53.888
What does he like to eat?
Does he like toad?"

27:53.889 --> 27:56.091
Just, surely. I know
you don't know me that well,

27:56.092 --> 27:57.425
but you know me enough that...

27:57.426 --> 27:59.361
I've never said to you,
"Do you know what?

27:59.362 --> 28:01.696
I'd love a bit of toad."
I've never said that to you.

28:01.697 --> 28:04.599
You could have just nipped it in
the bud there and then gone,

28:04.600 --> 28:06.568
"Oh, he's not a fan of that.
He's not."

28:06.569 --> 28:08.803
I don't like it.

28:08.804 --> 28:11.106
They're waving me over.

28:13.909 --> 28:16.711
So this is like a murder scene

28:16.712 --> 28:18.546
with a bit
of toad's head there.

28:18.547 --> 28:20.682
Oh, look at this.

28:23.953 --> 28:26.388
Chicken, chicken.

28:26.389 --> 28:30.425
Just a little bit 'cause I'm not
very good with these.

28:30.426 --> 28:31.826
He's better than me.
Ah.

28:31.827 --> 28:33.528
That just looks like noodles.

28:35.831 --> 28:38.266
Mmm. Nice. Mmm.

28:38.267 --> 28:39.434
Lots of that.

28:41.470 --> 28:43.071
No, love it.
Love it.

28:43.072 --> 28:44.606
Mmm.

28:44.607 --> 28:46.474
Oh, just...

28:46.475 --> 28:48.343
Just chewing.

28:50.846 --> 28:52.814
Another minute.

28:52.815 --> 28:54.249
I think the baby's choking.

28:54.250 --> 28:55.617
Hang on.

28:55.618 --> 28:58.019
Eating toad was weird.

28:58.020 --> 29:00.355
Um...

29:00.356 --> 29:02.490
I had a little bit of toad.

29:06.395 --> 29:08.296
Like, uh...

29:08.297 --> 29:10.432
Chicken.
Just chicken.

29:10.433 --> 29:13.134
This woman
was forcing it to me.

29:13.135 --> 29:14.569
She was saying,
"No, eat it, eat it."

29:20.242 --> 29:22.410
Ugh! Not fun.

29:22.411 --> 29:24.345
Every time I swallowed it,
it was coming back up.

29:24.346 --> 29:25.580
It was like it was still alive

29:25.581 --> 29:27.248
and the legs were still
kicking itself out of my head.

29:29.185 --> 29:30.785
Ugh! Ugh!

29:30.786 --> 29:32.887
Right. No more.

29:41.297 --> 29:42.964
What's he making, then?

29:44.366 --> 29:46.234
Not a toilet door.
I know that much.

29:46.235 --> 29:49.771
Hello.

29:49.772 --> 29:51.573
What...
what are you making?

29:51.574 --> 29:52.774
What is this?

29:52.775 --> 29:54.242
Coffin.

29:54.243 --> 29:56.845
Coffin?

29:56.846 --> 29:59.447
Is this for someone local?

29:59.448 --> 30:01.816
This lady here.

30:01.817 --> 30:03.718
It's for this lady?

30:03.719 --> 30:05.720
She looks pretty healthy.

30:07.123 --> 30:08.723
It's better to make it now,

30:08.724 --> 30:11.226
because when you're young,
you prepare those things.

30:11.227 --> 30:14.329
When you're old and you won't
be able to organize it.

30:14.330 --> 30:16.631
Doesn't it depress you,
seeing this every day

30:16.632 --> 30:17.932
when you leave your house?

30:17.933 --> 30:19.100
Not the way it looks.

30:19.101 --> 30:21.569
I think it's a nice-looking
coffin, as coffins go,

30:21.570 --> 30:23.505
but I don't want to be reminded
that I'm gonna die...

30:23.506 --> 30:24.772
Not every day.

30:26.475 --> 30:27.709
I'm not scared of death.

30:27.710 --> 30:30.245
I'm not worried about it.

30:30.246 --> 30:32.313
All right.

30:32.314 --> 30:35.416
Maybe you can help me
sanding the coffin.

30:40.723 --> 30:42.457
I mean,
my flat isn't big enough

30:42.458 --> 30:44.225
to have something like this
hanging around.

30:44.226 --> 30:45.727
I haven't got any outside space,

30:45.728 --> 30:47.929
so I'd have to have
a parking permit for this.

30:47.930 --> 30:49.764
So I couldn't be doing this
at home.

30:49.765 --> 30:52.867
But there's something good
about it

30:52.868 --> 30:56.604
because as you get older...
you know, she's in her 60s...

30:56.605 --> 30:59.207
it's a nice little project,
isn't it?

30:59.208 --> 31:02.277
She's got a lot.
This is probably sorted out.

31:02.278 --> 31:04.045
She doesn't have to worry
about that.

31:04.046 --> 31:05.413
The house is probably paid for.

31:05.414 --> 31:07.582
D you need something to do
to keep you going.

31:07.583 --> 31:09.417
If you haven't got
any little projects,

31:09.418 --> 31:12.053
that's when you die.

31:12.054 --> 31:14.155
So, in a way...

31:14.156 --> 31:16.491
It's just something that,
when she goes to bed at night,

31:16.492 --> 31:18.359
she's got a little "to do" list
in her head...

31:18.360 --> 31:20.528
"Coffin needs to be varnished.
I'll have to sort that."

31:20.529 --> 31:23.865
'Cause there's not that much
else around here, is there,

31:23.866 --> 31:25.300
to keep your mind busy?

31:28.737 --> 31:31.172
Look at this.
He's gone off now.

31:31.173 --> 31:32.774
He's having his lunch.

31:32.775 --> 31:35.076
He left me here doing this.

32:01.770 --> 32:04.539
You have one new message.

32:17.219 --> 32:18.620
My friend, Kung Fu.

32:21.938 --> 32:23.877
...Kung Fu.

32:24.458 --> 32:26.456
What do I want to see
Kung Fu for?

32:41.504 --> 32:43.405
Violent, isn't it?

32:43.406 --> 32:47.008
It's pretty impressive the way
everyone's remembered the kick.

32:47.009 --> 32:49.444
It was never like this
for me, school.

32:49.445 --> 32:52.814
About 25 minutes was just spent
with all the kids

32:52.815 --> 32:55.116
trying to find a pair of shorts
out of lost property

32:55.117 --> 32:57.319
'cause no one ever remembered
to bring the kit.

32:57.320 --> 32:59.287
So it was more like a "Trinny & Susannah"
than a P.E. lesson

32:59.288 --> 33:00.889
we'd all be sort of going,
"Are these your type?"

33:00.890 --> 33:02.424
"Do you want to wear these?"
"I'll wear them."

33:02.425 --> 33:04.626
Just everyone
taking it seriously.

33:04.627 --> 33:06.828
The P.E. teacher
wasn't a proper P.E. teacher.

33:06.829 --> 33:08.863
He did geography
when he wasn't doing P.E.

33:08.864 --> 33:12.033
and that's why we have
a lot of fat kids.

33:12.034 --> 33:14.969
Leo.

33:14.970 --> 33:16.137
How are you?

33:17.840 --> 33:20.141
Welcome to Shaolin

33:20.142 --> 33:22.944
and where the origin of Kung Fu
coming from.

33:22.945 --> 33:26.815
And you are going to see
the Kung Fu training.

33:26.816 --> 33:29.484
This is the metal.

33:29.485 --> 33:31.086
All right.

33:31.087 --> 33:33.555
And we're going to put on
our throat.

33:33.556 --> 33:37.792
If I use my finger,
just have a little touch...

33:37.793 --> 33:39.227
All right!
Yeah, just tell me.

33:39.228 --> 33:40.729
You don't have to do that,
yeah.

33:40.730 --> 33:43.398
...And you will have
a very big...

33:43.399 --> 33:44.733
Yeah, that's...

33:47.303 --> 33:48.303
Ooh-ee!

33:49.305 --> 33:50.772
Hyah!

33:50.773 --> 33:52.674
Hyah!
Hyah!

33:54.977 --> 33:57.045
Hyah!

33:57.046 --> 33:58.513
That's got to hurt, don't it?

34:00.883 --> 34:03.618
So I'll see you
outside the hotel,

34:03.619 --> 34:05.387
about sort of 4:00,
quarter to 5:00.

34:05.388 --> 34:08.223
4:00 A.M. Okay?

34:08.224 --> 34:10.625
4:00 in the morning.

34:10.626 --> 34:12.393
You having a laugh?

34:14.996 --> 34:16.931
Is he having a laugh?

34:16.931 --> 34:20.201
I can't tell.
They're hard to read.

34:20.202 --> 34:23.271
All right.
Well, that's good, isn't it?

34:23.272 --> 34:25.639
You know, I've been walking
the wall for the last few days,

34:25.641 --> 34:27.842
you know, aching all over,

34:27.842 --> 34:29.978
and now he wants me to get up
at 4:00 in the morning

34:29.978 --> 34:31.746
to do some Kung Fu.

34:31.746 --> 34:35.216
That's nice and relaxing,
isn't it?

34:35.217 --> 34:37.719
And he just went...

34:37.719 --> 34:39.454
Like that.

34:39.455 --> 34:41.523
Ohh!

34:43.492 --> 34:45.326
Ai!

34:49.197 --> 34:52.100
Where did he hit it?
He hit it there, didn't he?

34:52.101 --> 34:53.868
No.

34:53.869 --> 34:56.036
Ooh!

34:56.038 --> 34:58.006
Hmm.

35:01.744 --> 35:03.878
No.

35:09.585 --> 35:11.953
Shit.

35:14.221 --> 35:16.255
You are late.

35:16.256 --> 35:19.158
In two minutes, downstairs.

35:22.629 --> 35:23.830
He wasn't joking, was he,

35:23.831 --> 35:26.065
when he said he was gonna
come 'round at 4:00.

35:26.066 --> 35:27.998
Thought he was just having
a bit of fun with me.

35:28.897 --> 35:31.098
Nice start to the day.
Moon's still out.

35:32.867 --> 35:34.034
Yeah.

35:34.035 --> 35:35.375
Thing is, I don't know
what power I've got.

35:37.050 --> 35:38.517
That's the thing.

35:38.518 --> 35:40.681
If I start wrestling with him,
I don't know how strong I am.

35:40.770 --> 35:42.304
I might do some damage...

35:42.305 --> 35:43.939
By accident...

35:43.940 --> 35:46.708
'Cause I don't go about
punching people and stuff,

35:46.709 --> 35:48.777
so I don't know
how hard I can hit.

35:48.778 --> 35:50.846
I might...
I might really hurt him.

35:50.847 --> 35:52.514
See, if I'm
just a proper mugger.

35:52.515 --> 35:54.282
I'm walking down
the street, right?

35:54.283 --> 35:56.184
I look at you.
I'm going this way, yes.

35:56.185 --> 35:58.286
Hang on a minute.
Yeah, just get back a bit.

35:58.287 --> 36:01.156
So, I'm walking down the street,
and I think,

36:01.157 --> 36:03.892
"This fella looks like
he's got a few quid,"

36:03.893 --> 36:06.128
and I'd go... I'd go...
I'd go...

36:06.129 --> 36:08.029
"Excuse me. You haven't got
the time on you, have you?"

36:08.030 --> 36:09.097
And grabs your money.

36:09.098 --> 36:10.465
Oh.
Aah! All right!

36:10.466 --> 36:12.534
Give us your money.

36:12.535 --> 36:13.902
Ohh!

36:13.903 --> 36:15.470
Right, yeah, yeah.
Watch what will happen.

36:15.471 --> 36:17.606
Yeah, yeah. I know, yeah.
I got it the first time.

36:17.607 --> 36:18.874
Come on, go!

36:18.875 --> 36:20.108
All right.

36:20.109 --> 36:22.210
Quickly! Faster!
Come on, come on!

36:25.248 --> 36:26.748
Fuck off.

36:26.749 --> 36:28.183
Quick!

36:29.452 --> 36:30.819
Fuck off.

36:32.488 --> 36:34.489
He didn't know
what me health is.

36:34.490 --> 36:36.558
At no point since
I've been here has he gone,

36:36.559 --> 36:38.226
"Now, Karl,
it's a serious issue.

36:38.227 --> 36:39.694
Have you got
any health problems?"

36:39.695 --> 36:41.530
He's always pushing
a little bit more.

36:41.531 --> 36:42.731
He loves giving pain out.

36:42.732 --> 36:44.299
He's not a Buddhist, is he?
He's a lunatic.

36:44.300 --> 36:46.668
Do it. Do it.
Up.

36:48.871 --> 36:50.071
Right.

36:50.072 --> 36:51.406
Right.

36:51.407 --> 36:52.841
What am I doing?

36:52.842 --> 36:54.643
Seriously.
What is going on here?

36:57.146 --> 36:58.780
Okay, Karl.
I give you a challenge.

36:58.781 --> 37:00.849
What sort of challenge?

37:00.850 --> 37:02.617
Hyah!

37:02.618 --> 37:05.520
What's the other challenge?

37:06.923 --> 37:09.357
This is glass.
Balloon.

37:09.358 --> 37:12.727
I'm going to throw the needle
from this way

37:12.728 --> 37:14.129
to get this balloon.

37:14.130 --> 37:16.598
You're gonna throw a needle
through the glass...

37:16.599 --> 37:17.632
Yes.

37:17.633 --> 37:18.900
...Hit the balloon...
Yes.

37:18.901 --> 37:20.202
...Hole in glass?
Yes.

37:20.203 --> 37:22.571
So you're gonna...
Hey, hang on a minute! Right.

37:22.572 --> 37:24.840
1...

37:24.841 --> 37:26.775
2...

37:29.378 --> 37:30.579
No way.

37:30.580 --> 37:33.582
Jesus.

37:33.583 --> 37:34.749
I'm impressed with that.

37:34.750 --> 37:37.319
You want to have a try?

37:37.320 --> 37:39.488
Here we go.

37:39.489 --> 37:41.323
Quiet please.

37:41.324 --> 37:42.624
Quiet please.

38:05.248 --> 38:07.015
Sorry about that.

38:07.016 --> 38:09.217
I'm not cut out for Kung Fu.

38:09.218 --> 38:10.519
I know that much.

38:14.357 --> 38:16.291
That shouldn't hurt, should it?

38:16.292 --> 38:18.527
Just having a cup of tea.

38:21.631 --> 38:23.098
Ahh.

38:27.989 --> 38:29.682
With all these
aches and pains and that,

38:29.757 --> 38:31.255
you know, Ricky and Steve
have sorted me out

38:31.256 --> 38:34.191
with a Chinese massage,
which isn't like them, now.

38:34.192 --> 38:35.859
Lay down.

38:35.860 --> 38:37.961
Get the socks off?

38:39.197 --> 38:42.266
This is how it starts,
isn't it.

38:42.267 --> 38:44.935
You are having a laugh.
Come on, now.

38:46.237 --> 38:47.971
Oh, my God.

38:50.475 --> 38:53.177
See that?
Is that normal?

38:53.178 --> 38:54.978
No, lay down.

38:56.481 --> 38:57.481
Boy.

38:57.482 --> 38:59.983
All right,
that's... that's hot now.

38:59.984 --> 39:01.318
That's mental.

39:01.319 --> 39:03.487
No, that's hot.
That's hot.

39:03.488 --> 39:05.856
Okay, now, what is she doing?

39:05.857 --> 39:07.124
What is she doing?

39:07.125 --> 39:08.492
I've seen massages
on the telly.

39:08.493 --> 39:10.627
You don't normally have to have
a fire extinguisher on standby

39:10.628 --> 39:12.262
when you're having
a...massage.

39:12.263 --> 39:14.331
What is this doing?

39:14.332 --> 39:16.600
This is a traditional
Chinese massage.

39:16.601 --> 39:17.901
But why?
Tell me why, though.

39:17.902 --> 39:19.603
Why is this traditional
Chinese massage?

39:19.604 --> 39:21.305
I think it relaxes the muscles.

39:21.306 --> 39:23.640
No, it doesn't relax me,
so what does it do?

39:23.641 --> 39:25.642
Why is she setting fire to me?

39:25.643 --> 39:26.977
What good is it doing me?

39:26.978 --> 39:28.912
Don't just stand there
saying it's traditional.

39:28.913 --> 39:31.115
"It's traditional. It's what they do here.
It's a delicacy."

39:31.116 --> 39:32.216
What is she doing?

39:32.217 --> 39:33.684
When have gloves on fire

39:33.685 --> 39:35.285
ever been associated
with having a massage?

39:35.286 --> 39:37.621
Aah! I can feel it.
I can feel it.

39:37.622 --> 39:39.256
I might as well have
walked in there...

39:39.257 --> 39:40.557
Aah!

39:40.558 --> 39:43.026
...And been greeted
by Edward Scissorhands.

39:43.027 --> 39:45.762
Right. I felt that.
Put it out.

39:45.763 --> 39:48.332
Put it out, please!

39:48.333 --> 39:51.635
It's not a good sort of
combination, that, really...

39:51.636 --> 39:53.203
Having something done like that

39:53.204 --> 39:55.205
with a woman
who can't understand me.

39:55.206 --> 39:57.474
This leg's fine, tell her.

39:57.475 --> 39:58.976
This leg is great.

39:58.977 --> 40:01.678
I just want this one,
and then we can go.

40:03.848 --> 40:05.682
Aah! That's hot now.

40:05.683 --> 40:09.319
Maybe she's just a frustrated
magician or something.

40:10.455 --> 40:12.856
Couldn't get a gig doing magic.

40:12.857 --> 40:14.825
Ends up doing back rubs,
and she's come up with an idea

40:14.826 --> 40:16.226
with having gloves
that are on fire.

40:18.196 --> 40:21.098
I... I screamed me head off,
didn't I?

40:21.099 --> 40:22.533
'Cause it was...

40:22.534 --> 40:24.868
And I'm not messing, either,
for the cameras.

40:24.869 --> 40:26.403
'Cause I don't really do that.

40:26.404 --> 40:28.005
It really hurt.

40:29.607 --> 40:32.543
What was that bleeping sound?

40:32.544 --> 40:33.944
Fire alarm?

40:37.582 --> 40:39.516
I've traveled miles, haven't I?

40:39.517 --> 40:41.518
And this is the end of it,
is it?

40:41.519 --> 40:44.121
I mean, I thought you meant to
save the best till last,

40:44.122 --> 40:46.123
but what is this?

40:46.124 --> 40:47.457
Bloody hell.

40:56.134 --> 40:57.801
Well, that's where it ends,
isn't it?

40:57.802 --> 41:00.270
I mean, I haven't gotten another
message from Steve saying,

41:00.271 --> 41:04.007
"Right. Get your snorkel out.
You still haven't seen it all."

41:04.008 --> 41:07.077
And this definitely
isn't you, is it.

41:07.078 --> 41:09.780
They still got handy Andy
working on it,

41:09.781 --> 41:11.381
by the sounds of things.

41:11.382 --> 41:14.184
It doesn't feel like
a wonder of the world...

41:14.185 --> 41:15.319
Just this bit.

41:15.320 --> 41:17.921
I liked it up on the hills
where nobody was,

41:17.922 --> 41:20.457
but you got a fella down there
selling hot dogs,

41:20.458 --> 41:23.493
they've built a bit of
a conservatory on it over there,

41:23.494 --> 41:25.596
bloke flogging photographs,

41:25.597 --> 41:27.664
and then a lot of banging.

41:27.665 --> 41:30.467
It's nonstop.

41:30.468 --> 41:32.502
I don't get it, though.
How come...

41:32.503 --> 41:35.005
I mean, this isn't
protecting anything, is it?

41:35.006 --> 41:37.374
'Cause if the enemy
was coming down there,

41:37.375 --> 41:39.476
come across there,
buy a hot dog.

41:39.477 --> 41:41.278
I mean,
they want to get over it.

41:41.279 --> 41:43.313
I mean,
take your shoes and socks off.

41:43.314 --> 41:46.350
It's not even that deep there.
You can just wander 'round it.

41:46.351 --> 41:48.518
So what is it protecting?

41:56.094 --> 42:00.230
This is my last sin
that I've got to get rid of.

42:08.873 --> 42:12.309
There's an old Chinese proverb

42:12.310 --> 42:16.046
by this Mao fella that says,

42:16.047 --> 42:18.348
"A toad in a well

42:18.349 --> 42:22.886
"only gets to see
some of the sky,

42:22.887 --> 42:26.023
"and if the toad came up,

42:26.024 --> 42:28.525
he'd see more of the world,"

42:28.526 --> 42:32.062
which, you know,
is a bit like me, in a way.

42:32.063 --> 42:35.065
I've seen more of the world
just from doing this.

42:35.066 --> 42:38.402
I don't know if it's made me
a better person or not,

42:38.403 --> 42:41.305
but he's saying,
if you get out of the well,

42:41.306 --> 42:43.273
you'll see the bigger picture.

42:43.274 --> 42:44.541
It's good for you.

42:44.542 --> 42:45.642
But I say it isn't.

42:45.643 --> 42:46.977
And the thing is,

42:46.978 --> 42:49.079
it's not even worth getting out
and seeing more sky here

42:49.080 --> 42:51.548

42:52.817 --> 42:54.351
I wouldn't get out
of any hole here.

42:54.352 --> 42:56.278
'Cause they'll grab you and cut
your head off and eat you.
