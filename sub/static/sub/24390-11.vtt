of waiting,

00:10.700 --> 00:13.500
I finally met my baby girl.

00:13.500 --> 00:15.166
And as Shep was recuperating

00:15.166 --> 00:17.266
from his own visit
to the hospital,

00:17.266 --> 00:20.000
Chelsea found herself
the unwitting pawn

00:20.000 --> 00:22.400

love triangle with Austen.

Saint's birthday party

00:52.033 --> 00:53.600
remained drama-free,

00:53.600 --> 00:55.166
it was Ashley's temper tantrum

00:55.166 --> 00:57.166

Hey, Elvis.
Oh, man.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.533
Oh, Lord.

09:07.300 --> 09:08.567
Cam.

09:08.567 --> 09:10.266
- Oh, hey.
- Hey, darling.

09:10.266 --> 09:12.066
- Suzy Homemaker's
just in the kitchen.

09:12.066 --> 09:13.467
You look like

09:13.467 --> 09:15.200
an offering priest,
Suzy Homemaker.

09:15.200 --> 09:17.166
- I took a shower this morning,

09:17.166 --> 09:18.734
for the first time
in two weeks.

09:18.734 --> 09:20.533
- You are joking, I'm sure.

09:20.533 --> 09:22.467
- No, I'm not.
God.

09:22.467 --> 09:25.533
- My armpits were on the verge
of looking like a man.

09:25.533 --> 09:28.133
- I do not need to know...

09:28.133 --> 09:30.467
I brought you something.

09:30.467 --> 09:34.533
Meme made these by hand.

09:34.533 --> 09:37.433
- No, darling.

09:37.433 --> 09:39.200
It's just old.
They're old.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.633
- That's sweet.

09:40.633 --> 09:43.100
My mom always wanted
to be a grandma.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.600
She is beside herself.

09:44.600 --> 09:47.367
Her little trinket bags
are overflowing.

09:47.367 --> 09:48.500
What?

09:48.500 --> 09:50.600
- Little kids love
stuff like this.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.200
- This is a bunch of crap.

09:52.200 --> 09:54.333
- That's what children love.

09:54.333 --> 09:57.100
- With chokeable parts,
mind you.

09:57.100 --> 09:59.767
Obviously save these,
'cause they're special.

09:59.767 --> 10:02.767
But, to be honest,
I'll never use them.

10:02.767 --> 10:04.500
- Well, I'll take 'em back.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.433
But you know I have them.
- Thank you.

10:06.433 --> 10:09.233
Maybe when I have
my second kid.

10:09.233 --> 10:11.633
Psych.

10:11.633 --> 10:13.433
- I understand.
- Nothing is coming out of this

10:13.433 --> 10:14.467
ever again.

10:14.467 --> 10:15.500
- O-okay.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.600
I understand.
I understand.

10:17.600 --> 10:19.600
- The second night home
from the hospital,

10:19.600 --> 10:22.667
I'm laying in the bed
at 3:00 in the morning,

10:22.667 --> 10:26.266
sobbing uncontrollably
to Jason, saying,

10:26.266 --> 10:28.400
"What have we done?"

10:31.233 --> 10:35.600
- She is upstairs
sleeping soundly.

10:35.600 --> 10:38.400
- Let me see.
Aww.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.600
- "We had a great life.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.533
"Why did we do this?

10:42.533 --> 10:45.200
Why did we ruin our life?"

10:45.200 --> 10:46.600
When she goes down
in that crib,

10:46.600 --> 10:49.767
these are my moments
that I feel human again.

10:49.767 --> 10:51.133
Well, you look good.

10:51.133 --> 10:53.233
I know you think
you look tired.

10:53.233 --> 10:55.000
But you look good to me.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.767
- Everybody's like,
"You need to sleep

10:56.767 --> 10:58.667
when the baby sleeps."
You know?

10:58.667 --> 11:00.600
But she makes
even a little noise...

11:00.600 --> 11:02.000
- I know.
- I wake up.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.233
- I know.
Isn't it amazing

11:04.233 --> 11:06.433
that the maternal instinct
kicks in?

11:06.433 --> 11:09.300
Everything centers around her.

11:09.300 --> 11:11.033
- It does.

11:11.033 --> 11:13.700
After a few days have passed,
you start learning

11:13.700 --> 11:16.233
how to breastfeed,
and you start learning

11:16.233 --> 11:19.133
what this sound means,
or what that cry means.

11:19.133 --> 11:21.233
- And it has to, right now.
- I know.

11:21.233 --> 11:23.000
It used to center around me.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.500
It'll go back to that, Cam,
don't worry about it.

11:25.500 --> 11:27.567
- It's almost like
Palmer and I

11:27.567 --> 11:30.400
are kind of learning together
at the same time.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.567
I went and saw
the lactation consultant,

11:32.567 --> 11:34.133
yesterday.
- Oh, yeah.

11:34.133 --> 11:35.700
- Basically, they told me that

11:35.700 --> 11:37.767
I have an oversupply of milk.

11:37.767 --> 11:39.400
- Cameran.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.166
- I mean, the other day
I was nursing her,

11:41.166 --> 11:42.667
and I had my shirt off.

11:42.667 --> 11:46.000
And one boob, there was milk
just pouring out.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.333
Like, Jason could not
believe it.

11:47.333 --> 11:49.533
- Wow.
- I mean, it was--it's insane.

11:49.533 --> 11:51.066
- So what do you do
if you go out?

11:51.066 --> 11:52.600
- It's not glamorous.
I can't go out.

11:52.600 --> 11:55.066
It is like Groundhog Day
over here.

11:55.066 --> 11:56.600

get out of this house,

11:56.600 --> 11:58.166

11:58.166 --> 12:01.066
- But it's also
a very short period of time.

12:01.066 --> 12:02.600

and I know

12:02.600 --> 12:06.066
she's gonna grow up and be
an asshole teenager one day.

12:06.066 --> 12:09.600

gets Jason's personality,

12:09.600 --> 12:12.200
she will be a delight
to live with.

12:12.200 --> 12:14.166

She's grounded..."

17:31.033 --> 17:33.066
- Yeah.
- "And we love her."

17:33.066 --> 17:35.734
It's important for my family
to approve of my girlfriend,

17:35.734 --> 17:39.567

sort of a vetting system.

17:39.567 --> 17:41.667

a bad decision.

17:44.166 --> 17:48.700

signifies a future,

17:48.700 --> 17:51.333

a false signal.

17:51.333 --> 17:54.533

is this ----ing promise ring.

17:54.533 --> 17:57.300
Do you want to marry her, or
do you want to end this whole?

17:57.300 --> 18:00.200
Yes or no?

- If you want me to.
- Oh...

35:41.266 --> 35:43.133
I think now's a good time for me

35:43.133 --> 35:44.467
to find out
where that restroom is.

35:48.667 --> 35:51.333
Thomas and I are--

35:51.333 --> 35:52.533
we're struggling.

35:52.533 --> 35:54.266
That's why it's, like,

35:54.266 --> 35:56.000
hard to have that conversation
even with Kathryn.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.467
Because right now,
I don't know where I stand.

35:57.467 --> 35:59.233
- That's tough, though.
- Since I got back

35:59.233 --> 36:01.266
from California,
you know, I feel like

36:01.266 --> 36:02.767
he's sort of been--
I don't know,

36:02.767 --> 36:04.667
a little bit self-destructive
in some ways.

36:06.700 --> 36:08.400
- Hi.
- Good to see you.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.266
- Great.

36:10.266 --> 36:13.033
- When everything--
- Sounds like Thomas.

36:13.033 --> 36:15.166
- You're supposed to describe

36:15.166 --> 36:17.700
smell, taste, overall,
and then help him with a name.

36:17.700 --> 36:20.734
But I don't know anything
about beer, so I don't know.

36:28.767 --> 36:31.000
- Is this really
weighing heavy on you?

36:31.000 --> 36:32.433
- Are we using numbers
to rate it?

36:32.433 --> 36:34.166
Or am I supposed
to use a word?

36:34.166 --> 36:35.700
- Just a couple adjectives.

36:35.700 --> 36:37.667
- That's it.
- Um, adjectives, okay.

36:37.667 --> 36:40.633
- You should judge it,
because I don't like beer.

36:47.333 --> 36:50.467
- Whitney.
What is up, buddy?

36:50.467 --> 36:52.066
- Let me taste your sh--.

36:52.066 --> 36:53.467
- Yeah, dude, I want
you to taste my sh--, bro.

36:53.467 --> 36:55.133
If you spit it out,
I'm gonna kill you.

36:55.133 --> 36:57.333
I'm gonna ki--

36:57.333 --> 36:59.266
- What a real jackass.
- I had to do it.

36:59.266 --> 37:02.734
You know I had to do that.

37:02.734 --> 37:04.533
- Craig.
- Give me a hug.

37:04.533 --> 37:06.133
I haven't seen you in a while.
- I know, I love ya.

37:06.133 --> 37:07.533
- I love you, too.

37:07.533 --> 37:10.300
- So, Cameran shows up
with Palmer at my work.

37:10.300 --> 37:12.200
- No way.
Did you hold her?

37:12.200 --> 37:14.700
- Yeah, I held her.
I look like a natural, don't I?

37:14.700 --> 37:16.166
- Do I have to fill one of these
out?

37:16.166 --> 37:17.533
- Yes.
Shep you--

37:17.533 --> 37:19.200
I bet you'd have
really good names.

37:19.200 --> 37:21.734
- Yes, names.

37:21.734 --> 37:25.166
"The Brokel Brewing Co."

37:25.166 --> 37:27.066
Why?
- I don't like it.

kind--I don't know.

Hey, did Kathryn--
is the best bowler

37:33.233 --> 37:35.233
I've ever seen.
- Yeah, right.

37:35.233 --> 37:37.066
- She bowled two strikes.

37:37.066 --> 37:39.333
And then a bunch
of gutter balls.

37:39.333 --> 37:40.500
- See, it's like
one or the other.

37:40.500 --> 37:42.100
- But that makes it fun.
- I know.

37:42.100 --> 37:43.333
I had fun.
It was nice to do something...

37:43.333 --> 37:45.100
- Like, super simple.

37:45.100 --> 37:47.600
- Like the aroma.

37:47.600 --> 37:49.600
- Are Thomas and Ashley
still here?

37:49.600 --> 37:52.433
- She's right there.
- I really like Thomas' sweater.

37:52.433 --> 37:54.734
He does have kind of
a little gut going, though.
