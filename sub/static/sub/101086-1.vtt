02:16.595 --> 02:17.429
<i>Hello?</i>

02:18.597 --> 02:19.297
<i>Mr. Thorn?</i>

02:22.400 --> 02:26.038
<i>Just three packages? A few
have been missing around here.</i>

02:26.072 --> 02:27.940
<i>So I'm taking three
and leaving two.</i>

02:28.540 --> 02:29.374
<i>Good?</i>

02:33.946 --> 02:34.747
Thanks.

05:05.131 --> 05:06.899
How much longer
do you have there?

05:11.037 --> 05:13.139
<i>It's different than last time.</i>

05:13.172 --> 05:14.206
No, it's not.

05:16.042 --> 05:18.844
<i>Have you transferred
the house into your name?</i>

05:23.983 --> 05:28.586
<i>Jonathan, Richard has been
nice enough to set that all up-</i>

05:28.620 --> 05:30.156
He's a lawyer, you pay him.

05:30.189 --> 05:34.193
<i>He's always done more
than he needs to for us.</i>

05:34.226 --> 05:35.761
Sure, he charges appropriately.

05:39.932 --> 05:43.202
Hey, they shut down the plant.

05:44.136 --> 05:45.137
That's good news.

05:46.072 --> 05:47.139
I mean it's pathetic.

05:48.641 --> 05:50.276
Dad's death wasn't enough, it took
another hundred and fifty three, but-

05:50.309 --> 05:54.213
- <i>They didn't know anything when we worked there...</i>
- No, mom, they lied to you.

05:54.246 --> 05:55.915
You make excuses for everyone.

05:55.948 --> 05:59.584
<i>Well, you make excuses
for not visiting me.</i>

05:59.617 --> 06:00.853
We're seeing each
other right now.

06:00.886 --> 06:02.487
<i>We don't have to talk.</i>

06:04.090 --> 06:07.559
<i>Just come here and...
and hold my hand.</i>

06:09.662 --> 06:10.963
<i>I missed you.</i>

07:33.779 --> 07:36.715
A man was hit by a car six
blocks away. Another was shot.

07:37.783 --> 07:39.351
<i>It's not risky to just go out...</i>

07:39.385 --> 07:40.753
Have you improved
since you left?

07:41.320 --> 07:43.956
- <i>Well, that's different.</i>
- It's not.

07:43.989 --> 07:45.291
You never should have left.

07:46.759 --> 07:49.795
- <i>Jonathan, you would be safe here.</i>
- You would be safe here.

07:50.996 --> 07:54.700
- <i>Honey, we're gonna be okay...</i>
- I gotta go.

07:54.733 --> 07:55.701
<i>Honey...</i>

11:08.861 --> 11:09.928
Yes?

11:10.963 --> 11:12.097
<i>Thanks for the note,
it was great.</i>

11:12.131 --> 11:14.867
<i>But it says take five.
There's only three.</i>

11:14.900 --> 11:16.201
There are five.

11:16.235 --> 11:19.438
Really? There's only three here.

11:19.471 --> 11:21.106
It's not right.

11:21.140 --> 11:24.510
<i>Are you talking to him?
Fucking can he see us?</i>

11:24.543 --> 11:25.344
<i>Yeah.</i>

11:26.145 --> 11:28.047
<i>Thank you for your business.</i>

11:28.080 --> 11:30.382
<i>We love serving
you over the years.</i>

11:30.416 --> 11:33.052
<i>Ah, we have some great specials
I'd like to tell you about.</i>

11:33.085 --> 11:36.088
- Which boxes are there?
- <i>Well, it's Tuesday, so it's noodles.</i>

11:36.121 --> 11:39.992
- Not you, him. Which boxes are missing?
- <i>Oh, not sure.</i>

11:40.025 --> 11:41.628
<i>Come out here and check,
then I can take these.</i>

11:41.661 --> 11:45.497
- <i>And I thank you personally.</i>
- I don't need thanks. I need the boxes there.

11:45.531 --> 11:46.498
They are not here.

11:47.466 --> 11:48.534
<i>They might have been taken.</i>

11:50.637 --> 11:51.837
Please go.

11:53.038 --> 11:56.842
They'll all be late. Be on time
tomorrow. Nothing changes.

11:58.577 --> 12:00.612
<i>I think he has prisoners
in the basement.</i>

12:00.647 --> 12:02.314
<i>That's what the food is for.</i>

12:03.315 --> 12:04.316
<i>What do you think?</i>

14:14.246 --> 14:15.414
I'm calling the police.

14:16.281 --> 14:17.650
<i>What? I didn't do shit.</i>

14:17.684 --> 14:19.585
Leave. I don't have
anything you want.

14:19.618 --> 14:21.353
<i>You don't even know what I want.</i>

14:21.386 --> 14:24.056
Twenty-three million Americans have their
packages stolen every year, you're not original.

14:24.089 --> 14:28.460
<i>Wrong. I'm here to collect
donations for the whales.</i>

14:28.494 --> 14:29.696
Now you're lying.

14:29.729 --> 14:32.164
<i>I'm not lying. Whales
are in danger and shit.</i>

14:34.266 --> 14:37.035
<i>So, you wanna donate?</i>

14:37.503 --> 14:38.738
No.

14:38.771 --> 14:41.039
You're a thief and a liar and
I want nothing to do with you.

14:41.073 --> 14:42.608
<i>Okay, that's just fucking rude.</i>

14:42.642 --> 14:44.376
<i>What did the whales
ever do to you, huh?</i>

14:44.409 --> 14:45.544
I'm not giving you my money.

14:45.577 --> 14:47.145
<i>Yo, what's with your windows?</i>

14:48.781 --> 14:50.482
Sun exposure causes cancer.

14:50.516 --> 14:52.551
<i>So sun is your biggest concern.</i>

14:53.452 --> 14:54.386
<i>Okay.</i>

14:55.955 --> 15:00.292
<i>Okay. So, so I'm collecting
donations to make the sun dimmer.</i>

15:01.293 --> 15:02.294
<i>You wanna donate?</i>

15:05.497 --> 15:07.232
<i>Fuck. Go!</i>

15:07.266 --> 15:10.569
- <i>Hey, what's going on here?</i>
- <i>None of your business, Sir. Walk away.</i>

15:10.602 --> 15:13.138
- <i>Hey, I don't think you're supposed to be here.</i>
- <i>Fuck off!</i>

15:21.346 --> 15:23.382
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

15:24.182 --> 15:28.120
- <i>You're fucking laughing?</i>
- <i>Yeah, we gotta go.</i>

15:29.221 --> 15:32.324
<i>No. Fuck, you fucking can't...
you just can't leave him!</i>

15:32.357 --> 15:33.559
<i>Yeah.</i>

15:34.359 --> 15:37.563
Think about your daughter,
...fucking trial.

15:43.268 --> 15:46.371
<i>Please open the door.
Open the door. Open.</i>

15:52.377 --> 15:56.683
<i>Please, open the door.
Please. Please.</i>

15:56.716 --> 15:58.483
<i>Two seconds
till I leave your ass here.</i>

15:58.517 --> 16:00.653
<i>So fucking leave!</i>

16:00.687 --> 16:03.388
- <i>What is wrong with you?</i>
- <i>Please.</i>

16:03.422 --> 16:05.490
<i>Who gives a shit
about this asshole?</i>

16:09.494 --> 16:11.631
<i>Don't fucking leave
me out here!</i>

16:13.365 --> 16:14.767
<i>Open this door!</i>

16:19.906 --> 16:22.174
<i>You're gonna fucking
call the cops, huh?</i>

16:23.575 --> 16:25.277
<i>You were out here, too!</i>

16:26.713 --> 16:28.213
<i>Don't fucking call the cops.</i>

16:28.246 --> 16:30.115
<i>Oh, you fucking kidding me?</i>

16:31.784 --> 16:33.518
<i>This is your fucking fault.</i>

16:35.253 --> 16:37.857
<i>We wouldn't even be doing
this shit if it wasn't for you.</i>

16:44.831 --> 16:46.264
<i>Fuck it.</i>

17:36.581 --> 17:37.616
Hello?

17:52.564 --> 17:54.199
He's gone. You can leave now.

18:05.812 --> 18:07.814
- You recorded everything?
- It's only live.

18:10.049 --> 18:11.751
So what are you gonna do?

18:12.685 --> 18:14.020
You're gonna say it was us?

18:14.053 --> 18:15.287
It wasn't you.

18:15.822 --> 18:16.621
Are you gonna tell?

18:17.422 --> 18:19.591
It's not my place,
I'm not involved.

18:20.559 --> 18:21.794
Then I guess you weren't.

18:30.602 --> 18:32.370
Why is there plastic everywhere?

18:33.405 --> 18:34.941
It's something crazy people do.

18:37.576 --> 18:38.543
Are you crazy?

18:39.912 --> 18:43.049
Viruses and bacteria are eighteen
nanometers, this blocks them.

18:55.661 --> 18:56.963
They're gonna
want to talk to you.

18:56.996 --> 18:58.731
I'm not going out there.

18:58.765 --> 19:01.333
What? This is
your house, you just-

19:01.366 --> 19:04.971
just tell them you didn't see
anything and they'll go away.

19:20.887 --> 19:23.055
Hey, good afternoon.
Officer Heather Cain.

19:23.089 --> 19:24.589
Do you know what
happened out here?

19:27.359 --> 19:29.862
Can you open the door
just a little bit more please?

19:32.698 --> 19:35.968
So, you don't know anything?

19:36.002 --> 19:36.836
No.

19:37.737 --> 19:39.839
- Do you own this home?
- My mother does.

19:39.872 --> 19:41.406
Is there anyone else here?

19:45.778 --> 19:48.781
Alrighty then, we're gonna need to
take you in to get a proper statement.

19:48.815 --> 19:50.716
- I don't know anything.
- Well, you're a special witness.

19:50.750 --> 19:52.617
No, you can't.
No probable cause.

19:52.652 --> 19:53.953
You're a material witness.

19:53.986 --> 19:54.987
This is harassment.

19:55.922 --> 19:57.924
We can
pull you if we need to.

19:57.957 --> 19:59.558
I do not leave this house.
This is not me.

19:59.591 --> 20:01.127
- I do not leave this house.
- I need assistance up here!

20:01.160 --> 20:03.461
- You are leaving today, Sir.
- No, it's not me.

20:03.495 --> 20:04.797
- I do not leave this house.
- Alright, calm down.

21:39.825 --> 21:41.060
I can wait here all day.

21:41.761 --> 21:42.995
Froze up again.

21:43.796 --> 21:44.730
I got it.

21:45.097 --> 21:46.431
Hey, there.

21:50.937 --> 21:53.706
So you know nothing
about what happened?

21:54.907 --> 21:57.176
Then what are you doing here?

21:57.209 --> 22:01.513
You're just wrong
place wrong time.

22:05.251 --> 22:06.451
But

22:08.120 --> 22:11.190
to have large bruises
on his chest

22:11.223 --> 22:13.693
and that makes me think
that this was a crime

22:13.726 --> 22:16.963
and then you're refusing to talk
to me and that raises another.

22:17.797 --> 22:19.865
So why won't you talk to me?

22:20.565 --> 22:21.834
Let me call someone.

22:22.768 --> 22:25.972
Oh, no, you're not under arrest.

22:26.839 --> 22:28.174
No.

22:29.008 --> 22:30.876
You're a material witness.

22:31.677 --> 22:35.480
You just answer my questions and

22:36.315 --> 22:37.615
then you can go.

22:38.751 --> 22:44.957
Do you know how many unsolved
deaths I see every day?

22:44.991 --> 22:46.859
Just answer a few questions.

22:46.892 --> 22:49.261
Large bruises on his chest.

22:49.295 --> 22:51.697
That raises a flag.

22:51.731 --> 22:53.032
Under arrest.

22:53.065 --> 22:55.768
Why won't you talk to me?

23:00.706 --> 23:04.744
Alright, give me a chance
at solving this, alright?

23:04.777 --> 23:09.048
Was it an accident? So
just tell me what you know.

23:11.117 --> 23:12.651
I haven't left that
house in two years.

23:12.685 --> 23:15.553
- Whatever happens outside has nothing to do with me?
- So this is your excuse.

23:15.587 --> 23:19.291
- It's the truth.
- No, you're using it as an excuse not to talk to me.

23:19.325 --> 23:20.592
I just don't know anything.

23:20.626 --> 23:22.728
Then how is a lawyer gonna help?

23:22.762 --> 23:24.230
Because you want an
answer any way possible.

23:24.263 --> 23:26.632
So if your injustice goes hand
in hand with unsolved crime,

23:26.665 --> 23:29.902
just because you don't have an answer
doesn't mean I have anything to do with it.

23:29.935 --> 23:30.936
Oh.

23:38.177 --> 23:39.678
Give him the phone.

23:47.253 --> 23:48.586
You can use mine.

23:51.991 --> 23:52.958
Thank you.

23:53.325 --> 23:54.794
You weren't involved?

23:57.830 --> 23:59.298
They said it might
have been an accident.

24:02.768 --> 24:04.804
Why'd you call me if
you have nothing to say?

24:05.671 --> 24:07.807
It happened outside,
I'm not involved.

24:07.840 --> 24:10.242
I know you weren't out there
but did you see something?

24:10.276 --> 24:11.777
Maybe on the door camera?

24:12.978 --> 24:14.346
He didn't ring the doorbell.

24:15.247 --> 24:16.348
He?

24:16.382 --> 24:19.151
I don't know they, she, it
was a clown that killed him.

24:20.186 --> 24:22.154
Jonathan, this is serious.

24:22.188 --> 24:23.289
He had a life.

24:23.322 --> 24:25.758
He had a family. They deserve
to know what happened.

24:25.791 --> 24:26.926
I don't know.

24:26.959 --> 24:29.128
I don't know him.
I don't know anyone.

24:29.795 --> 24:32.765
I haven't done anything wrong. I thought you
of all people could explain that to them

24:32.798 --> 24:33.833
and help get me home.

24:34.433 --> 24:36.202
Right and wrong.

24:36.235 --> 24:39.638
I don't deserve this.
I'm not involved.

24:43.442 --> 24:45.311
I told your mother
I was coming here.

24:47.046 --> 24:49.381
It's just gonna worry her
and make her worse.

24:51.383 --> 24:53.018
Let's go visit her.

24:53.052 --> 24:54.720
Please, not today.

24:54.753 --> 24:56.388
Come on, you're already out.

24:56.422 --> 24:58.958
- She's not looking too great.
- I know.

25:00.059 --> 25:02.661
I already watched
my father disintegrate.

25:02.695 --> 25:04.697
She just wants to see her son.

25:05.197 --> 25:07.833
How is me watching
her die going to help?

25:09.702 --> 25:11.403
I'm the one that
has to live with that.

25:13.005 --> 25:14.373
I'm ready to be alone.

25:16.709 --> 25:18.177
Is that really how you feel?

25:19.712 --> 25:24.183
I'll go see her, just not today.
I need to get home.

25:27.219 --> 25:28.687
Go give me your statement.

25:58.450 --> 25:59.685
Glad you called me.

26:01.854 --> 26:03.155
No man is an island.

26:04.790 --> 26:06.292
It's okay to rely
on somebody else.

26:07.927 --> 26:10.262
Even if you try everything,
you do affect someone else.

26:13.098 --> 26:14.767
It's normal to be
scared for your mom.

26:17.369 --> 26:18.470
Are you listening?

26:20.406 --> 26:21.373
Jonathan.

27:06.185 --> 27:07.519
What do you do?

27:10.089 --> 27:11.123
What do you mean?

27:13.359 --> 27:14.927
How do you make money?

27:15.894 --> 27:18.130
I... I sell things.

27:30.843 --> 27:32.444
I sell things, too.

27:34.580 --> 27:36.782
You know we both
are entrepreneurs.

27:38.584 --> 27:39.852
How great.

27:42.187 --> 27:42.821
This

27:45.524 --> 27:47.793
incident that happened out here,

27:49.528 --> 27:51.030
it was an accident.

27:53.299 --> 27:55.100
An unfortunate occurrence.

27:56.068 --> 27:59.171
I think it's better for both of
us we just forget about it, right?

28:02.308 --> 28:03.842
- Trying to.
- Good.

28:12.351 --> 28:14.119
Town, on the other hand,

28:16.922 --> 28:18.157
leaving me like that,

28:21.060 --> 28:23.962
opening that door, coming
in here, that's different.

28:45.584 --> 28:47.353
Good luck in your business.

30:15.340 --> 30:16.643
Mom, I...

30:16.676 --> 30:18.577
<i>Jonathan Thorn?</i>

30:19.411 --> 30:20.312
Yes.

30:22.214 --> 30:24.016
<i>I have terrible news
to inform you.</i>

30:24.049 --> 30:25.317
<i>Your mother...</i>

31:02.488 --> 31:05.557
As you know, I've met with some
of the other people from the plant,

31:05.591 --> 31:07.493
uh, might be able to help.

31:08.828 --> 31:10.562
Are they
accepting the blame?

31:12.130 --> 31:14.734
No, they won't
do that. Blends into...

31:14.767 --> 31:17.002
Son, don't let
them do it to you.

31:17.469 --> 31:18.638
Ah!

31:36.188 --> 31:37.189
<i>Jonathan.</i>

31:40.225 --> 31:41.093
<i>Jonathan.</i>

31:48.200 --> 31:49.167
<i>Jonathan!</i>

31:55.474 --> 31:57.744
Thanks for doing that. You can
just leave them out there.

31:58.410 --> 31:59.712
<i>I didn't get her ashes.</i>

32:00.312 --> 32:01.213
<i>We go together.</i>

32:02.414 --> 32:03.816
I can't go to a hospital.

32:03.850 --> 32:07.252
Do you know how many hospital-associated
infections happen every day?

32:07.286 --> 32:08.721
You're already acclimated.

32:08.755 --> 32:11.223
<i>Come on, Jonathan, we gotta go.</i>

32:13.258 --> 32:14.326
<i>How did this happen?</i>

32:17.529 --> 32:18.798
It was just the money.

32:18.831 --> 32:20.065
<i>What does that mean?</i>

32:20.098 --> 32:24.136
You saw my mother as a lonely
lady with a settlement check.

32:24.704 --> 32:25.705
<i>That is not true.</i>

32:27.239 --> 32:28.073
It was the money.

32:30.175 --> 32:32.110
That's all people
like you ever want.

32:33.612 --> 32:35.581
<i>I never accepted a fee.</i>

32:36.849 --> 32:38.651
<i>You never made it easy on her.</i>

32:40.419 --> 32:43.455
<i>I did everything I could to help
because nobody else would.</i>

32:44.757 --> 32:45.658
<i>Come on.</i>

32:46.491 --> 32:47.694
<i>Come with me.</i>

32:47.727 --> 32:49.094
- I can't...
- <i>You're gonna regret not going.</i>

32:49.127 --> 32:52.431
...leave this house. You don't understand.
Somebody is out there.

32:54.667 --> 32:56.435
<i>There's nobody here.</i>

32:56.468 --> 32:58.170
<i>You're scared of nothing.</i>

32:58.738 --> 32:59.806
<i>I'm not going without you.</i>

32:59.839 --> 33:01.273
You can't just leave her there.

33:02.341 --> 33:04.276
<i>You already did.</i>

33:04.309 --> 33:06.478
<i>You made that choice. You said you didn't
want to watch her die and you didn't.</i>

33:06.511 --> 33:08.480
I saw her every day.

33:09.548 --> 33:10.783
<i>Do you think this
is a conversation?</i>

33:13.352 --> 33:16.188
<i>Sorry, you're gonna have
to take care of it yourself.</i>

33:16.923 --> 33:18.590
<i>It's what your mom
would have wanted.</i>

34:31.864 --> 34:32.765
Yo.

34:34.366 --> 34:35.868
What are you doing?

34:36.903 --> 34:38.603
Come on man, you
gotta get up. Grab.

34:41.440 --> 34:43.408
Can you go to the hospital
and get my mother's ashes?

34:48.280 --> 34:49.347
Uh...

34:51.450 --> 34:55.420
I could... I could give you a
ride, but then we're even.

34:56.354 --> 34:57.422
I can't.

34:57.456 --> 34:58.356
Why not?

35:02.461 --> 35:04.296
He's not gonna find us there.

35:09.635 --> 35:13.706
Here. Hey, it solves
one of your problems.

35:18.678 --> 35:19.846
You can't keep those.

35:21.513 --> 35:22.547
Let's go.

35:27.486 --> 35:28.453
What?

35:29.822 --> 35:30.823
I don't have key.

35:32.591 --> 35:35.527
Nobody's gonna steal
your fucking plastic.

35:37.429 --> 35:38.296
Come on.

36:44.997 --> 36:46.666
So,

36:47.633 --> 36:48.935
not close with your mom?

36:51.503 --> 36:53.505
We were closer
when I was younger.

36:55.141 --> 36:57.910
Well, yeah, that makes sense.

36:58.678 --> 36:59.645
I mean

37:01.379 --> 37:05.718
that's the only person you actually know for
like the first eight years of your life.

37:06.585 --> 37:09.989
And then you figure out they are a
douchebag just like everybody else.

37:13.926 --> 37:15.460
That's mean.

37:16.696 --> 37:19.665
My mom wasn't that bad, she
just only thought about herself,

37:20.599 --> 37:22.702
which is fine, she just
shouldn't have had kids.

37:24.502 --> 37:25.972
Then you wouldn't be alive.

37:26.005 --> 37:27.940
Yeah, well, mistakes happen.

37:27.974 --> 37:31.043
Now I figured out she didn't
want me there, so I got out.

37:32.211 --> 37:33.679
How old were you?

37:35.447 --> 37:36.448
Sixteen.

37:39.752 --> 37:42.621
I had Benny, so it's
not like I was alone.

37:44.891 --> 37:45.958
Same guy?

37:48.828 --> 37:49.862
Yep.

37:52.464 --> 37:55.567
He's actually very charming when
he's not fucking up your life.

38:25.597 --> 38:28.801
Take your time, but there
are some things we need to discuss.

38:28.834 --> 38:30.670
I understand that.

38:32.772 --> 38:35.440
Some mute, some take
a while to get talking.

38:35.942 --> 38:38.644
So, this is Thomas Grant.

38:41.613 --> 38:42.882
Annabelle Thorn.

38:44.884 --> 38:48.486
Oh, yeah, right.

38:48.520 --> 38:50.622
Annabelle, 1138.

38:52.825 --> 38:53.759
Sorry.

38:55.027 --> 38:58.965
Go ahead, Miss, whenever
you're ready, I am here.

38:58.998 --> 39:00.598
And how will you be paying?

39:02.301 --> 39:04.637
- Us?
- Yes.

39:04.670 --> 39:05.738
Payment.

39:06.105 --> 39:07.472
What am I paying for?

39:08.908 --> 39:11.711
It's the medical certificate
claiming death, the post-mortem exam,

39:11.744 --> 39:13.511
embalmment, cremation services.

39:13.545 --> 39:14.814
You embalm before you cremate?

39:14.847 --> 39:18.516
State, city, county
taxes, hospital fees.

39:18.550 --> 39:22.121
I could sit here and come up
with all the answers you need

39:22.154 --> 39:25.523
but I'm busy, you're busy,
let's get through this.

39:27.326 --> 39:28.560
Not my fault.

39:35.668 --> 39:36.568
Here.

39:38.004 --> 39:39.839
- What are these?
- For you.

39:39.872 --> 39:41.807
- For what?
- Grief, depression.

39:41.841 --> 39:44.643
- I don't need this.
- Don't worry about it, freebies, not on the bill.

39:44.677 --> 39:46.645
- I'm fine.
- You don't look fine.

39:46.679 --> 39:48.314
No problem.

39:48.347 --> 39:52.251
And, yes, you do need to accept and sign
for them in person or in the same hospital.

39:52.284 --> 39:54.687
I'm sure you've
been here before.

39:55.121 --> 39:56.355
This is ridiculous.

39:56.389 --> 40:00.226
Yes, it's checked here that she
went peacefully in the night.

40:02.061 --> 40:09.201
Yes, her soul did transition into the
afterlife very nicely at 10:57 p.m.

40:09.235 --> 40:13.105
, so the official time
of death is 11:45.

40:13.139 --> 40:17.977
We did have some doctors come in and check
and she was promptly cremated afterwards.

40:18.010 --> 40:21.147
No, I am so sorry I cannot answer
that question over the phone.

40:21.180 --> 40:24.150
You're gonna have to come
in if you want that information.

40:25.151 --> 40:26.986
- Mm-Hm. Mm-Hm.
- Okay, we are all set.

40:27.653 --> 40:29.021
One moment, please.

40:29.388 --> 40:30.588
Great.

40:32.224 --> 40:34.994
And I'm sorry for your
loss, Mr. and Mrs. Grant.

40:35.027 --> 40:36.195
Go ahead, Ma'am.

40:36.228 --> 40:38.130
I know it's tough.

40:38.164 --> 40:40.800
Yes, grief is part
of the process.

40:43.769 --> 40:44.804
We just stole.

40:45.704 --> 40:47.807
You can't steal your own mother.

40:48.774 --> 40:52.378
Besides, that guy's not gonna
remember who you are or what happened.

40:52.411 --> 40:55.781
He will remember. There were cameras.
We're going to get caught.

40:57.216 --> 41:00.152
Don't you pride yourself on
living your life off the grid?

41:00.186 --> 41:03.055
Like your house is still
connected to water and power

41:03.089 --> 41:05.791
and you use delivery
people for your bidding.

41:05.825 --> 41:12.597
But like your own weird little world
separate from the society, nonetheless.

41:13.866 --> 41:15.234
Fuck that guy.

41:16.368 --> 41:17.703
I want to go home.

41:17.736 --> 41:18.971
Mm.

41:19.672 --> 41:21.107
It's big a noper.

41:21.140 --> 41:22.108
You owe me one.

41:22.141 --> 41:23.209
I've got things to do.

41:23.242 --> 41:26.378
Dude, you suck at lying.

41:26.412 --> 41:27.246
Don't do it.

41:46.699 --> 41:49.401
Go up to the door,
say you're there to see Sarah.

41:50.836 --> 41:53.172
- Who's Sarah?
- My daughter.

41:54.840 --> 41:56.442
The less you say, the
more believable it will be.

41:56.475 --> 41:59.378
Like, feels like you work
for the government

41:59.411 --> 42:02.314
and don't give a shit like that
fucking sloper back there.

42:02.348 --> 42:02.982
You have a daughter?

42:05.784 --> 42:07.253
See if her father's been by.

42:10.055 --> 42:12.291
- Can you take a picture?
- I don't have a camera.

42:13.192 --> 42:14.426
Use your phone.

42:17.129 --> 42:18.430
You don't have a phone?

42:20.199 --> 42:21.267
No one to call.

42:22.501 --> 42:24.703
You're a fucking whack job.

42:25.237 --> 42:27.339
Here, use mine.

42:29.875 --> 42:31.377
Oh, and give her this.

42:33.345 --> 42:35.981
Give her that from me.

43:02.841 --> 43:05.110
Hey! What do you want?

43:06.011 --> 43:08.781
Uh, I'm here to see Sarah.

43:11.217 --> 43:13.953
Month review, you're early.

43:13.986 --> 43:15.821
Place is messy, I'm sorry.

43:17.523 --> 43:19.391
I'd have remembered
a cutie like you.

43:20.059 --> 43:21.227
You got ID for me?

43:24.496 --> 43:28.867
I can sit here and come up with all the
answers you need but I'm busy, you're busy.

43:28.901 --> 43:30.302
Let's get through this.

43:30.336 --> 43:33.005
- It's not my fault.
- Fine. That's fine.

43:34.073 --> 43:35.941
Hey, you heard anything
about payment?

43:36.475 --> 43:38.444
- I still haven't got any checks on her.
- No.

43:40.246 --> 43:41.914
It was worth a shot.

43:41.947 --> 43:43.215
Sarah!

43:50.489 --> 43:53.425
...she's not allowed
to have hers.

43:53.459 --> 43:57.196
Her mother was a real piece of
work being a danger and at all.

43:57.229 --> 44:00.232
Sarah just shut herself off
from the world because of it.

44:02.001 --> 44:03.302
Poor little thing.

44:08.874 --> 44:11.543
- Well, you're gonna ask him questions?
- Am I going home?

44:11.577 --> 44:13.979
Not you sweetheart, him.

44:16.982 --> 44:21.453
- Where is home?
- With my mom and sometimes my dad.

44:21.487 --> 44:22.454
We live downtown.

44:23.422 --> 44:26.191
- Can I go?
- Maybe next time.

44:31.397 --> 44:32.931
Has your father
come to see you?

44:32.965 --> 44:34.166
They don't know where I live.

44:35.401 --> 44:37.936
They lost their right to see
a sweet little girl like you.

44:43.275 --> 44:45.077
Hey, turn up your brightness.

44:45.944 --> 44:48.280
When the game goes
to night, it really helps.

44:52.351 --> 44:54.520
- Thanks.
- Alright, that's enough game time.

44:55.554 --> 44:56.989
You got two minutes.

45:08.901 --> 45:10.302
Can I take your picture?

45:11.270 --> 45:12.204
Sure.

45:14.540 --> 45:16.075
That's my mom's phone.

45:16.643 --> 45:18.210
Is she your friend?

45:21.380 --> 45:24.583
Yeah, we're friends.

45:25.317 --> 45:26.852
Does she miss me?

45:27.419 --> 45:28.354
She does.

45:29.488 --> 45:31.557
Then why isn't she's spending
time with me anymore?

45:32.291 --> 45:34.860
- Did I do something?
- No.

45:36.061 --> 45:37.529
She wants to see you really.

45:38.197 --> 45:40.199
She sent me to check on you.

45:40.232 --> 45:41.934
But that's not the same.

45:50.609 --> 45:52.378
Don't you want to be in it?

46:03.322 --> 46:04.490
Give that to my mom.

46:26.646 --> 46:28.280
Don't look at me, get in.

46:32.985 --> 46:34.186
Drive, you idiot.

46:34.721 --> 46:36.121
I don't know how.

46:36.723 --> 46:39.358
Okay, put the keys
in the ignition.

46:39.391 --> 46:42.327
The long vertical pedal is to go
forward, the other one is to stop.

46:50.335 --> 46:55.708
Okay, put your foot on the brake and then pull
that lever in the middle until the D lights up.

47:00.412 --> 47:03.015
- Now what?
- Take your foot off the fucking brake.

47:06.018 --> 47:09.988
Gently, gently, put your foot down
on the... the other pedal there.

47:12.458 --> 47:16.962
Yep, circle around,
circle around.

47:23.302 --> 47:25.337
You got to put your
fucking seatbelt on, man.

47:27.707 --> 47:29.374
This isn't so hard.

47:31.443 --> 47:33.378
No. Most people can do it.

47:36.749 --> 47:40.653
- Do you want to take over?
- No, you're good.

47:40.687 --> 47:43.155
Just read the signs
and do what they say.

47:49.328 --> 47:52.699
- You got my phone, man?
- Yeah.

48:09.649 --> 48:11.049
How long has she been there?

48:15.554 --> 48:17.189
They took her three weeks ago.

48:18.691 --> 48:21.694
That bitch gets paid to take her and
I have to steal to pay for a lawyer.

48:22.629 --> 48:24.229
I'm gonna get her back though.

48:24.263 --> 48:25.531
I'm sure that will
make her happy.

48:25.564 --> 48:27.165
It's better than there.

48:29.869 --> 48:32.337
I'm gonna make a beautiful
home for her someday

48:33.238 --> 48:35.107
and she'll forget any
of this ever happened.

48:41.480 --> 48:42.514
What about her?

48:46.585 --> 48:48.587
I don't really know
much about her.

48:50.122 --> 48:53.358
All she did was work. I think I
could have done more to help her.

48:54.560 --> 48:59.565
Well, can't blame yourself for what
she didn't do with her life, right?

49:01.366 --> 49:04.536
Anyway, funerals are for the
living. She's fucking dead.

49:07.306 --> 49:10.810
Did you not realize that?

49:13.412 --> 49:15.514
Whoa, you can't just stop
in the middle of the street.

49:19.351 --> 49:21.721
Hey! He's just learning,
asshole!

49:22.421 --> 49:23.455
Fuck!

49:25.223 --> 49:26.859
Come on, driving lesson is over.

49:27.627 --> 49:28.761
Come on.

49:31.430 --> 49:34.099
Look, I'm sorry, I'll help you, okay?
But we got to get out of here.

49:35.434 --> 49:36.535
Let's go.

49:43.241 --> 49:44.409
It's okay, you did good.

50:14.506 --> 50:15.642
How about over there?

50:38.397 --> 50:39.766
Hey, you do some of this.

51:27.647 --> 51:29.481
I thought it would be more.

51:33.385 --> 51:34.419
That's all.

51:35.988 --> 51:38.925
Everything you are, gone
in the shake of a bag.

51:39.959 --> 51:41.828
Or a kick down the stairs.

51:44.897 --> 51:46.933
You don't talk about that.

51:46.966 --> 51:47.867
- I can't...
- Stop it.

51:47.900 --> 51:50.402
- I've known his family.
- Stop it. Stop it.

51:51.403 --> 51:52.772
It was an accident.

51:54.741 --> 51:55.607
Was it?

52:01.513 --> 52:03.750
I didn't want fucking
Benny there.

52:04.751 --> 52:06.618
I was trying to do
the shit on my own.

52:10.422 --> 52:13.760
He found out that Sarah had
been taken and I freaked out.

52:13.793 --> 52:14.894
I don't know.

52:16.361 --> 52:17.897
Why did they take her?

52:20.565 --> 52:21.634
Because of him.

52:25.104 --> 52:30.375
He's like hammered, right?
And screaming about something

52:30.408 --> 52:34.312
and our lovely neighbor
calls the cops.

52:34.346 --> 52:38.985
They show up. Of course, he's
long gone, but they see Sarah,

52:40.352 --> 52:41.721
they claim it's unsafe.

52:43.388 --> 52:47.026
So they take her. And I can't afford
a lawyer, so I can't get her back.

52:50.696 --> 52:51.631
I'm sorry.

52:52.531 --> 52:55.935
Yeah, well, I'm sorry doesn't

52:56.769 --> 53:00.740
make anything better, right?
Like, I am sorry about your mom.

53:00.773 --> 53:02.909
It doesn't make you
feel any better, does it?

53:15.822 --> 53:18.356
Benny is always
there because of me.

53:22.695 --> 53:25.698
The delivery guy wouldn't have
been there if it wasn't for me.

53:27.900 --> 53:29.735
I guess we're in the same boat,

53:31.938 --> 53:33.739
the same fucking pond

53:36.142 --> 53:40.680
and all we can do is shut up
about it, hold on together.

53:44.616 --> 53:46.018
Thanks for making me do this.

53:47.419 --> 53:49.021
Thanks for checking in on Sarah.

53:50.522 --> 53:51.657
I needed that.

53:56.963 --> 53:59.065
So I guess we both got
something out of today.

54:03.535 --> 54:05.938
- Where are you going?
- That part's over.

54:39.872 --> 54:40.740
Kitchen?

54:41.641 --> 54:42.407
Wait.

54:47.512 --> 54:48.781
What are you doing?

54:51.583 --> 54:52.685
Oh!

54:54.153 --> 54:55.487
Just add water.

54:56.055 --> 54:57.757
You do have that, right?

54:58.724 --> 55:00.059
You need food.

55:02.828 --> 55:06.966
You're gonna feel sad and shitty for a
few days and I'm not gonna be around,

55:06.999 --> 55:10.836
so you can have a brownie
and you'll feel better.

55:21.047 --> 55:22.949
Now it's a party.

55:33.125 --> 55:35.795
Oh! That's awful.

55:43.568 --> 55:44.637
There you go.

55:45.771 --> 55:46.973
That'll make you feel better.

55:48.040 --> 55:49.574
I feel fine.

55:50.309 --> 55:52.979
Come on, man, everybody's
sad when someone dies.

55:53.012 --> 55:55.881
I am seriously sad that she's
dead and I didn't even know her.

56:05.992 --> 56:07.727
Doesn't suck, right?

56:11.163 --> 56:14.967
Just swallow any of that
or just rub it on your teeth?

56:36.822 --> 56:38.157
What the fuck?

56:55.975 --> 57:00.312
I put up the plastic for her
but she didn't want it in here.

57:04.150 --> 57:06.285
You can't keep
the whole world out.

57:06.919 --> 57:07.953
You can.

57:10.823 --> 57:12.058
I made it through.

57:20.666 --> 57:23.869
So, this was your mom?

57:28.340 --> 57:29.875
Can I show you something?

58:01.674 --> 58:03.342
Why do you watch this crap?

58:04.376 --> 58:06.045
I imagine I was there.

58:07.313 --> 58:09.915
It seems simpler back then.

58:10.749 --> 58:11.884
Easier to be happy.

58:12.952 --> 58:15.855
What you're watching is
the delusion of happiness.

58:17.823 --> 58:20.126
These people had shitty days.

58:20.793 --> 58:22.728
They just didn't film them.

58:28.033 --> 58:29.835
So this is what you do all day?

58:31.070 --> 58:32.705
It bothers you the way I live.

58:36.108 --> 58:37.676
You seem like a good person.

58:39.078 --> 58:40.346
Feels like a waste.

58:42.047 --> 58:44.383
I just don't fit any place else.

58:52.324 --> 58:54.426
You'd have to leave here to try.

58:55.427 --> 58:56.729
I tried.

59:01.333 --> 59:03.235
I once tried to
go to high school.

59:06.105 --> 59:07.273
And the first day

59:09.108 --> 59:12.811
I worked up just enough courage
to introduce myself to a girl.

59:12.845 --> 59:14.146
Prettier than me?

59:18.751 --> 59:22.454
She said, "I only talk
to guys with scars.

59:23.923 --> 59:25.191
Show me your scars."

59:26.458 --> 59:33.732
I didn't have any, so I ran away
to her friends giggling at me.

59:41.340 --> 59:44.043
In the art room I found
an X-Acto knife.

59:46.912 --> 59:50.684
I ran it across my arm
but it went too deep,

59:52.218 --> 59:53.919
jerked it and I hit a vein.

59:54.887 --> 59:57.489
Suddenly there's
blood everywhere.

1:00:00.326 --> 1:00:02.962
I had never felt pain like that.

1:00:04.430 --> 1:00:05.798
And I collapsed.

1:00:08.801 --> 1:00:12.404
Next thing I knew I
was in the hospital and

1:00:14.206 --> 1:00:15.474
I had my scars.

1:00:20.045 --> 1:00:21.847
You know what happened
when I went back?

1:00:25.918 --> 1:00:27.019
They laughed at me.

1:00:29.388 --> 1:00:32.157
I was trying to be
someone I'm not.

1:00:34.360 --> 1:00:35.761
This is who I am.

1:00:36.929 --> 1:00:38.230
This is where I belong.

1:00:42.401 --> 1:00:47.539
Okay, so the quiet, creepy guy works
up the nerve to approach a girl

1:00:47.573 --> 1:00:50.276
and she's expected
to throw herself at him?

1:00:50.309 --> 1:00:53.946
And then when she doesn't,
he fucking cuts his arm off.

1:00:55.981 --> 1:00:59.018
God, you're lucky they
only laughed, you psycho.

1:01:01.053 --> 1:01:06.959
Okay, no, no, no, no, no, don't get all emo
on me, run off to your mom's room again.

1:01:10.195 --> 1:01:13.232
Are you laughing?

1:01:16.935 --> 1:01:18.037
You're right.

1:01:20.306 --> 1:01:21.273
I know.

1:01:23.275 --> 1:01:29.348
Okay, get up. I'm tired of your sad
stories and your unrelated relatives.

1:01:37.256 --> 1:01:38.390
This is you, right?

1:01:44.163 --> 1:01:44.997
Here.

1:01:49.068 --> 1:01:51.170
Okay.

1:01:55.407 --> 1:01:59.878
Alright. Okay, come on,
let's go, let's dance.

1:02:03.082 --> 1:02:06.385
- What are you doing?
- Waltz box step.

1:02:06.418 --> 1:02:07.654
I'm still learning.

1:02:07.687 --> 1:02:08.921
Who taught you that?

1:02:10.489 --> 1:02:11.390
Internet.

1:02:12.591 --> 1:02:15.361
Reason number one my world
does not, it's cracked up to be.

1:02:15.961 --> 1:02:16.629
Come here.

1:02:17.996 --> 1:02:18.897
Come here.

1:02:25.003 --> 1:02:26.372
Okay, come on.

1:02:27.940 --> 1:02:31.543
Ready? And one, two.

1:02:35.614 --> 1:02:39.385
One, two, three,
one, two, three.

1:02:39.418 --> 1:02:40.552
One, two.

1:02:43.021 --> 1:02:44.256
One, two.

1:02:58.070 --> 1:02:58.904
What?

1:03:02.341 --> 1:03:04.910
The world feels
less scary in here.

1:03:08.013 --> 1:03:09.515
I like not feeling afraid.

1:03:17.690 --> 1:03:19.024
What was that?

1:03:21.460 --> 1:03:23.162
I know you are in there.

1:03:24.329 --> 1:03:26.098
I'd say go around,
we'll run to my car.

1:03:26.131 --> 1:03:27.566
No, no, we stay here,
it'll be safe here.

1:03:28.300 --> 1:03:31.303
- You can get...
- Please, please don't you let him in.

1:03:37.109 --> 1:03:38.110
Come on.

1:03:45.451 --> 1:03:48.987
<i>I was just doing it to protect
us. Now we're family.</i>

1:03:50.556 --> 1:03:52.257
<i>I love you lots.</i>

1:03:52.291 --> 1:03:54.159
<i>To be together is right.</i>

1:03:55.728 --> 1:03:57.697
<i>I love you lots.</i>

1:03:59.398 --> 1:04:05.003
<i>Let's work it out together and
I'll get Sarah back and start over.</i>

1:04:07.539 --> 1:04:08.708
<i>I need you.</i>

1:04:09.441 --> 1:04:11.410
<i>You need us. You know it.</i>

1:04:13.111 --> 1:04:15.314
<i>Let's get her back. Let's go get her.
Let's go get our daughter.</i>

1:04:21.086 --> 1:04:23.088
Benny, stop it!

1:04:26.158 --> 1:04:27.526
It's over!

1:04:41.106 --> 1:04:44.076
I'll make sure he doesn't bother you.
You don't have to worry.

1:04:44.109 --> 1:04:45.143
What about you?

1:04:47.579 --> 1:04:49.314
I'm sorry I stole your packages.

1:04:50.482 --> 1:04:51.350
I'm not.

1:06:40.525 --> 1:06:41.794
Everybody
makes mistakes.

1:06:43.228 --> 1:06:45.130
Takes guts to admit your own.

1:06:49.201 --> 1:06:50.637
Don't worry, they're
not gonna be mad.

1:07:05.517 --> 1:07:08.286
All right, let me
get this straight.

1:07:12.424 --> 1:07:16.729
You withheld crucial evidence which
may be too late to be of any help

1:07:16.763 --> 1:07:21.199
and you've got a condition
for meeting you said.

1:07:23.803 --> 1:07:25.638
I didn't want to be involved.

1:07:25.672 --> 1:07:26.773
Bullshit.

1:07:27.506 --> 1:07:29.742
- You're hiding something.
- I'm not.

1:07:29.776 --> 1:07:33.578
Jonathan felt he was at risk
coming forward with this.

1:07:33.612 --> 1:07:35.313
Tampering with evidence.

1:07:35.347 --> 1:07:37.717
He'll know this came from
my house and come after me.

1:07:37.750 --> 1:07:39.152
Then why do this now?

1:07:41.420 --> 1:07:43.690
I'm sure the victim's family
wants to know what happened.

1:07:44.423 --> 1:07:45.590
I hope this helps.

1:07:47.160 --> 1:07:51.631
Well, I doubt very much they want to
know that he was kicked down the stairs

1:07:51.664 --> 1:07:52.832
for some petty theft.

1:07:53.800 --> 1:07:55.600
That'll make them feel great.

1:07:55.968 --> 1:07:57.637
I can't change what happened.

1:07:58.336 --> 1:08:00.338
Look, is this what happened?

1:08:00.372 --> 1:08:01.941
Yes, it is.

1:08:01.974 --> 1:08:04.309
Well, why should I trust you?

1:08:04.342 --> 1:08:06.879
Put my name on it if it
makes you feel any better.

1:08:06.913 --> 1:08:08.280
I'll vouch for him.

1:08:10.282 --> 1:08:14.921
When new evidence like this
comes in, normally, it's fake.

1:08:15.688 --> 1:08:18.323
You know, maybe throw us off.

1:08:19.458 --> 1:08:22.028
Is that what's happening here?
We're getting too close?

1:08:22.061 --> 1:08:25.464
If you are getting close, this
should confirm that it's him.

1:08:25.865 --> 1:08:28.768
If you thought it was someone
else, you would be wrong.

1:08:43.415 --> 1:08:45.317
Was there anyone else with him?

1:08:46.886 --> 1:08:48.988
No, he did it alone.

1:10:12.638 --> 1:10:14.040
These are two big steps for you.

1:10:16.408 --> 1:10:17.542
Your mom would be proud.

1:10:30.723 --> 1:10:32.591
I think I'm gonna
walk home after.

1:10:34.559 --> 1:10:35.761
Fantastic.

1:10:36.762 --> 1:10:39.431
Good for you.
Get out in the world.

1:10:40.032 --> 1:10:41.934
If you get tired, call me,
I'll come pick you up.

1:11:11.864 --> 1:11:13.866
Please, sit.

1:11:24.844 --> 1:11:26.178
Did you know him well?

1:11:27.680 --> 1:11:28.781
Not well enough.

1:11:35.620 --> 1:11:37.790
- Are you his mother?
- Oh, no.

1:11:37.823 --> 1:11:39.491
No, I own this place.

1:11:39.926 --> 1:11:44.130
I... I don't like people
who are here to feel alone.

1:11:46.866 --> 1:11:48.968
There are worse things
than being alone.

1:11:52.872 --> 1:11:54.740
I've never figured
out what that is.

1:12:30.542 --> 1:12:31.911
I couldn't go in.

1:12:31.944 --> 1:12:33.813
It seemed easy for you.

1:12:33.846 --> 1:12:34.847
Are you okay?

1:12:36.782 --> 1:12:37.950
Why wouldn't I be?

1:12:40.319 --> 1:12:41.153
Get in.

1:12:50.296 --> 1:12:52.497
Cops fucked up
the apartment good.

1:12:53.032 --> 1:12:56.002
- How did they know it was him?
- I don't know.

1:13:01.807 --> 1:13:03.876
Not if they got him
they'll get me.

1:13:10.850 --> 1:13:13.252
Fuck!

1:13:34.640 --> 1:13:36.208
Oh, my God!

1:13:58.731 --> 1:14:01.734
- What?
- Nothing.

1:14:02.768 --> 1:14:05.071
Say whatever the fuck
you're thinking, Jonathan.

1:14:06.305 --> 1:14:08.007
Just thinking of a way to help.

1:14:09.008 --> 1:14:11.010
What, like going to
live in your bubble?

1:14:11.043 --> 1:14:12.244
I don't live in a bubble.

1:14:12.278 --> 1:14:15.681
- If you don't know that already, I can't help.
- I don't.

1:14:17.383 --> 1:14:18.651
Look at this.

1:14:20.786 --> 1:14:23.656
Right there, that's
your fucked up house.

1:14:24.123 --> 1:14:30.729
Look how much is out here
and you choose only that.

1:14:30.763 --> 1:14:33.732
- I don't need anything else.
- You don't get anything else.

1:14:33.766 --> 1:14:35.701
I just live the way I want.

1:14:35.734 --> 1:14:38.337
Why waste the time if
you're not doing anything?

1:14:38.370 --> 1:14:41.674
Why don't just get it over with?
Say fuck it and kill yourself?

1:15:00.092 --> 1:15:01.627
Benny is your own fault.

1:15:02.695 --> 1:15:04.230
I didn't fuck up your life.

1:15:04.830 --> 1:15:07.233
- Excuse me?
- You did. You know what he does.

1:15:07.266 --> 1:15:09.802
- You don't know.
- You like playing the victim

1:15:10.369 --> 1:15:13.339
sitting back and saying,
"I didn't have a choice, I'm trapped."

1:15:13.906 --> 1:15:16.842
It's easy to blame everything wrong on him,
that way you don't have to blame yourself.

1:15:18.144 --> 1:15:19.345
He's your box.

1:15:19.979 --> 1:15:21.347
You don't know how
to live without him.

1:15:22.615 --> 1:15:25.885
How's your life going without
your mother looking after you?

1:15:26.418 --> 1:15:28.087
At least I'm trying.

1:15:28.120 --> 1:15:29.722
So I fucked up.

1:15:31.390 --> 1:15:32.958
Just let me help you.

1:15:32.992 --> 1:15:33.993
Fuck you!

1:15:34.026 --> 1:15:37.963
You think you can just
swoop in here and save me?

1:15:38.364 --> 1:15:43.068
You think I haven't been through
this before? This is what I do!

1:15:43.435 --> 1:15:47.173
You and your scared little
existence isn't gonna help me.

1:15:47.206 --> 1:15:48.340
I turned him in.

1:15:51.410 --> 1:15:54.246
They're not coming after you.
It was the right thing to do.

1:16:01.420 --> 1:16:04.056
Well, you did it.

1:16:07.226 --> 1:16:12.431
Think it's gonna be easy for me to get Sarah
back now that her father's in jail for murder?

1:16:17.403 --> 1:16:19.772
I wasn't protecting him.

1:16:21.440 --> 1:16:22.274
Or me.

1:17:11.924 --> 1:17:13.192
Get in the car.

1:17:14.293 --> 1:17:16.462
Don't say anything,
just get in the car.

1:18:09.148 --> 1:18:13.052
At least let me help you get Sarah back.
I can set you up with a lawyer.

1:18:15.888 --> 1:18:17.389
Why are you doing this?

1:18:18.223 --> 1:18:21.126
I thought I had learned everything
that life had to teach me.

1:18:23.128 --> 1:18:26.598
The line of my life had curled
itself around in a circle.

1:18:26.633 --> 1:18:29.134
Everything was the
same again and again.

1:18:32.071 --> 1:18:36.108
I mean nothing to no one, which
is what I thought I wanted

1:18:36.141 --> 1:18:39.311
until Sarah and you reminded
me of what I was missing.

1:18:40.079 --> 1:18:41.180
She needs you.

1:18:43.382 --> 1:18:45.217
She can have a great life.

1:18:45.951 --> 1:18:48.554
And I can't bear the thought
of her being in that place

1:18:48.587 --> 1:18:50.589
knowing that I could
do something about it.

1:19:52.618 --> 1:19:54.386
Come in.

1:19:55.053 --> 1:19:56.054
Oh!

1:19:59.124 --> 1:19:59.992
Hello.

1:20:01.694 --> 1:20:02.594
Hi.

1:20:07.599 --> 1:20:08.400
Come in.

1:20:11.437 --> 1:20:15.240
We want to put all this
behind us, start fresh.

1:20:16.241 --> 1:20:18.010
Sarah is

1:20:18.043 --> 1:20:21.180
a wonderful little girl.

1:20:21.213 --> 1:20:22.981
I haven't done anything wrong.

1:20:24.183 --> 1:20:26.518
Everyone is just after me
for what he did, you know.

1:20:27.553 --> 1:20:28.655
Do you ever feel like that?

1:20:30.255 --> 1:20:31.156
Sure.

1:20:32.257 --> 1:20:35.093
So with him out of the
picture there's no problem.

1:20:37.329 --> 1:20:40.065
- He's the one in jail?
- Yeah.

1:20:41.233 --> 1:20:42.702
You have a former prier?

1:20:44.169 --> 1:20:45.337
Yes.

1:20:46.038 --> 1:20:48.440
But I've fulfilled all
of my requirements.

1:20:49.608 --> 1:20:51.477
So this is a new start.

1:20:52.444 --> 1:20:54.079
Jonathan's helping me.

1:20:55.247 --> 1:20:56.982
He's a great guy.

1:20:58.584 --> 1:20:59.585
I see.

1:21:08.060 --> 1:21:10.362
- What are you doing?
- I'm helping her.

1:21:11.163 --> 1:21:13.165
Why are you involved?
You don't know them.

1:21:15.267 --> 1:21:17.603
You helped my mother
when no one else would.

1:21:17.637 --> 1:21:19.739
How long did it take
you to trust her?

1:21:20.439 --> 1:21:22.174
- This is different.
- It's not.

1:21:22.842 --> 1:21:24.243
She needs help.

1:21:24.677 --> 1:21:25.577
Please.

1:21:28.648 --> 1:21:31.583
All right, keep a little distance.
I'll see what I could find.

1:21:31.617 --> 1:21:32.451
Thank you.

1:21:32.819 --> 1:21:34.319
Be careful.

1:21:34.353 --> 1:21:35.354
Of course.

1:21:48.267 --> 1:21:49.067
Damn it.

1:21:50.502 --> 1:21:53.272
- You actually have to...
- No, no, no, no, I got it, I got it, I got it.

1:21:56.575 --> 1:21:59.044
Boom. Boom. Boom.

1:22:07.352 --> 1:22:08.487
Whoa.

1:22:13.458 --> 1:22:14.326
How?

1:22:41.688 --> 1:22:45.758
<i>Hey, you know what Benny said
when we arrested him? You did it.</i>

1:22:46.592 --> 1:22:47.860
<i>He said you didn't know him.</i>

1:22:48.594 --> 1:22:49.696
<i>I don't know him.</i>

1:22:49.729 --> 1:22:51.363
Well, he knows you.

1:22:54.166 --> 1:22:56.368
- New car?
- What?

1:22:57.670 --> 1:22:58.537
Yours?

1:22:59.939 --> 1:23:01.106
No.

1:23:02.875 --> 1:23:04.476
That's interesting.

1:23:08.280 --> 1:23:09.147
Look there.

1:23:10.817 --> 1:23:12.150
same car.

1:23:12.885 --> 1:23:14.053
Do you know Town Munroe?

1:23:14.954 --> 1:23:19.157
That's who the car was last
registered to a few years back.

1:23:19.191 --> 1:23:23.428
Town Munroe was arrested
before associated with Benny.

1:23:24.229 --> 1:23:26.933
And now I find her
car here again.

1:23:26.966 --> 1:23:28.266
- Is she here?
- Well...

1:23:29.636 --> 1:23:30.369
No.

1:23:32.404 --> 1:23:35.742
Did she do something? Don't cover for her.
You don't need that.

1:23:36.375 --> 1:23:39.746
You don't have any idea
what you're dealing with here.

1:23:39.779 --> 1:23:41.279
She's not here.

1:23:42.982 --> 1:23:43.883
Well,

1:23:44.751 --> 1:23:46.819
your association with her

1:23:47.519 --> 1:23:50.890
makes your new
evidence kind of weak.

1:23:50.923 --> 1:23:52.959
So you're gonna have to help.

1:23:54.493 --> 1:23:56.863
You gotta tell me
what really happened.

1:23:58.765 --> 1:24:00.332
I already told you.

1:24:10.275 --> 1:24:11.176
All right.

1:24:12.745 --> 1:24:17.516
Well, we let Benny go 'cause we didn't
have enough to hold him any longer.

1:24:18.785 --> 1:24:22.955
Oh, and I'm issuing a
warrant for Town Monroe.

1:24:24.322 --> 1:24:26.258
You let her know if you see her.

1:24:27.492 --> 1:24:29.762
Looks better if
she turns herself in.

1:24:39.337 --> 1:24:39.839
You heard?

1:24:41.239 --> 1:24:44.409
<i>Baby, we gotta go
now. They are coming for you.</i>

1:24:44.443 --> 1:24:46.646
<i>I'm gonna go get Sarah
and then I'm gonna get you.</i>

1:24:46.679 --> 1:24:47.914
<i>Pick up!</i>

1:24:50.582 --> 1:24:52.785
- Does he know where she is?
- I didn't tell him.

1:24:52.819 --> 1:24:56.689
- Who does?
- Child Services? Richard?

1:25:15.742 --> 1:25:16.475
Hello?

1:25:17.476 --> 1:25:19.411
<i>There's
been an accident.</i>

1:25:29.922 --> 1:25:31.423
<i>He knows where she is.</i>

1:25:32.624 --> 1:25:33.592
<i>Sorry.</i>

1:25:33.626 --> 1:25:37.897
Fucking... He always
has to go too fucking far!

1:25:37.930 --> 1:25:39.732
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

1:25:40.398 --> 1:25:42.501
We have to go. We have
to get to her before he does.

1:25:42.534 --> 1:25:43.568
Come on.

1:25:43.602 --> 1:25:44.536
No, no, no. Town!

1:25:46.038 --> 1:25:51.010
Town, Town, stop! You're not gonna
help anyone, you're gonna get hurt.

1:25:51.911 --> 1:25:54.312
Town, I can't help you,
I'm not involved with things like this.

1:25:54.346 --> 1:25:55.815
You're involved!

1:25:55.848 --> 1:25:58.517
This is happening. You
saw what he did to him.

1:25:58.550 --> 1:26:00.285
I'm not waiting to see
what he does to her.

1:26:55.808 --> 1:26:57.844
- Where are you going?
- You wait here.

1:28:12.484 --> 1:28:14.754
Look here, get her
safe. I'll take care.

1:28:14.787 --> 1:28:15.888
- What?
- Go.

1:28:28.701 --> 1:28:30.770
It's okay, it's okay.

1:28:30.803 --> 1:28:33.505
I know we're going home.

1:28:33.538 --> 1:28:34.941
Mom said we're going home.

1:28:48.888 --> 1:28:52.158
What's going on? Where's my mom.

1:28:52.191 --> 1:28:53.759
We're gonna wait for her here.

1:28:54.193 --> 1:28:55.493
It's safe. Is that okay?

1:28:58.698 --> 1:28:59.966
You can watch a movie.

1:29:47.612 --> 1:29:48.613
You got away.

1:29:52.752 --> 1:29:55.855
Finally! Got the whole
band back together.

1:29:55.888 --> 1:29:57.957
Whooo-woohoo!

1:30:00.760 --> 1:30:01.961
Go find her.

1:30:15.007 --> 1:30:16.675
Okay, so here's
what's gonna happen.

1:30:18.044 --> 1:30:23.783
We're gonna leave and you're
gonna tell your detective friend

1:30:24.316 --> 1:30:28.054
whatever delusion makes you happy,
maybe it'll keep you out of jail.

1:30:28.087 --> 1:30:29.688
I haven't done anything wrong.

1:30:31.057 --> 1:30:33.692
Then why am I standing
here in your living room?

1:30:35.861 --> 1:30:39.732
I believe you kidnapped our
daughter and were seen in the act.

1:30:41.267 --> 1:30:45.104
Town and I are a team.
We help each other.

1:30:45.805 --> 1:30:47.139
We survive together.

1:30:47.173 --> 1:30:48.606
Town doesn't need you.

1:30:51.410 --> 1:30:53.578
You still think
she's on your side.

1:30:56.248 --> 1:30:59.151
She just used you to
get her daughter back.

1:30:59.185 --> 1:31:00.820
To get our family together.

1:31:02.088 --> 1:31:03.621
You're just a fall guy.

1:31:05.658 --> 1:31:09.361
Oh, man. This could
have been so easy.

1:31:10.930 --> 1:31:13.933
All you had to do was just
go on with this life, that's it.

1:31:13.966 --> 1:31:16.735
Just wandered downstream
with the rest of the fish.

1:31:18.070 --> 1:31:19.338
But you got involved.

1:31:20.406 --> 1:31:22.208
Now look at what you made us do.

1:31:23.209 --> 1:31:25.644
Town doesn't want to
be a part of your family.

1:31:26.312 --> 1:31:27.379
I know her.

1:31:50.970 --> 1:31:51.804
Town?

1:31:53.405 --> 1:32:00.112
Town, Town, come
back. And get home.

1:32:00.146 --> 1:32:01.747
Don't do this.

1:32:01.780 --> 1:32:04.049
- Do what?
- Let them go.

1:32:04.083 --> 1:32:04.884
Whoa.

1:32:06.252 --> 1:32:07.786
I'm not holding them.

1:32:09.121 --> 1:32:10.923
Did you see any struggle?

1:32:11.790 --> 1:32:13.092
Are they in pain?

1:32:14.226 --> 1:32:15.828
We're a family.

1:32:19.865 --> 1:32:22.902
- What are you doing?
- Just let me talk to her.

1:32:22.935 --> 1:32:25.871
- Why?
- You did something. She doesn't want to be with you.

1:32:28.073 --> 1:32:31.243
I'm trying to be nice
here. Just let it end!

1:32:37.816 --> 1:32:39.952
God, look at what
you made me do!

1:32:42.955 --> 1:32:44.957
I told you the plan.

1:32:44.990 --> 1:32:47.760
Just fucking stick
to it this time.

1:32:47.793 --> 1:32:49.395
You're gonna
end up killing them.

1:32:49.428 --> 1:32:50.796
Don't tell me what I'm gonna do.

1:32:50.829 --> 1:32:52.231
Just like the man outside.

1:32:52.264 --> 1:32:54.833
In your mind it'll be nothing but
an accident, nothing to do with you,

1:32:54.867 --> 1:32:57.136
but I know that you
are gonna kill them both.

1:32:57.169 --> 1:32:59.838
Just like you did me,
we mean nothing to you!

1:33:18.490 --> 1:33:21.360
No one gives a shit about you.

1:33:24.163 --> 1:33:26.065
I should have done this before.

1:33:56.161 --> 1:33:57.329
Are you okay?

1:33:59.198 --> 1:34:00.466
Yes. It's just my nose.

1:34:04.069 --> 1:34:07.006
I called them but they weren't
going to be fast enough.

1:34:07.473 --> 1:34:08.807
Thank you.

1:34:13.979 --> 1:34:15.114
I recorded it...

1:34:17.583 --> 1:34:20.452
so that everyone could
see exactly what happened.

1:34:28.861 --> 1:34:29.862
Hey.

1:34:31.463 --> 1:34:32.464
It's okay.

1:34:34.634 --> 1:34:38.037
Go be with Sarah. She's afraid.

1:34:39.071 --> 1:34:39.938
I'm okay.

1:34:41.173 --> 1:34:42.374
We're okay.

1:35:46.071 --> 1:35:48.507
Jonathan, what the hell
were you doing there?

1:35:48.540 --> 1:35:51.076
You're not protecting
anybody by doing this.

1:35:51.977 --> 1:35:54.012
This woman is going nuts.

1:35:54.046 --> 1:35:56.048
She wants you for kidnapping.

1:35:57.049 --> 1:35:58.550
You have to say
who else was there.

1:36:00.419 --> 1:36:04.523
- Will Town be all right?
- Oh, it's pretty clear it was self-defense.

1:36:05.124 --> 1:36:06.959
We've already let her go.

1:36:09.395 --> 1:36:11.029
Did you fill out the paperwork?

1:36:17.569 --> 1:36:18.437
Co-owners.

1:36:18.470 --> 1:36:20.572
I'm sure everyone
will be happy there.

1:37:01.513 --> 1:37:03.750
Two, three, and
then this foot back.

1:37:03.783 --> 1:37:04.651
On one.
