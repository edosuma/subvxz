to the high rollers room.

-Rita.

You should go help her.

Hey, Al.
You know she’s one of our performers.

11:10.127 --> 11:13.005
Oh, I know.
That’s why we let it go this long.

after 30 days, so consider yourself lucky.

a little more time, Al?

-No.

really got something here.

what it would be like to be you."

12:21.574 --> 12:22.783
"Blondes? [chuckles]

12:23.159 --> 12:24.285
That’s funny."

12:25.327 --> 12:26.328
-Eh-- Ah.
-[Sheila] What?

12:26.871 --> 12:29.081
I’m not sure if this really translates
to women.

12:29.415 --> 12:30.666
Men can be blond.

12:33.085 --> 12:34.378
"What’s funny about it?"

12:35.171 --> 12:36.797
Oh, uh...

12:37.214 --> 12:40.301
"Because I always used to picture you
somewhere."

12:40.885 --> 12:42.219
"Where’d you picture me?"

12:42.511 --> 12:45.097
[clears throat]
"Oh, I don’t know. Different places.

12:45.514 --> 12:48.225
Adventures.
You were always on some adventure."

12:48.517 --> 12:49.393
"Yeah."

12:50.394 --> 12:52.104
"And I used to say to myself,

12:52.480 --> 12:54.482
‘Lee’s got the right idea. He’s...

12:55.024 --> 12:57.610
out there in the world, and here I am.

12:59.278 --> 13:00.488
What am I doing?’"

13:02.281 --> 13:04.992
"Well, you were settin’ yourself up
for somethin’."

13:08.329 --> 13:09.663
Are you off-book?

13:11.373 --> 13:13.751
Oh, I have a good memory.
[chuckles softly]

13:15.252 --> 13:19.256
But, hey, I love all the stuff that...

13:19.548 --> 13:21.008
you’re doing with Austin.

13:21.467 --> 13:22.802
The self-doubt.

13:23.719 --> 13:26.055
Uh, I wasn’t acting yet.

13:27.515 --> 13:28.349
Oh.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.980
Do you wanna, uh, try out some blocking?

13:36.023 --> 13:36.982
Sure.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.569
-What, you want, like, a punch card?
-Yeah, maybe I do.

13:40.945 --> 13:43.322
Well, you still owe me
from the first time we were together.

13:43.405 --> 13:45.074
[Melrose]
Oh, I’m never paying you for that.

13:45.157 --> 13:46.867
-It’s a matter of principle.
-[Randy wailing]

13:46.951 --> 13:49.495
[Debbie] Okay. Love you Randy,
be nice to Jenny. Bye-bye!

13:49.578 --> 13:50.538
Hey, hey!

13:50.621 --> 13:53.707
Do you want to come see a man
about a horse?

13:54.542 --> 13:55.835
Don’t make fun of my play.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.128
I was not talking about your play.

13:58.212 --> 14:01.298
I have a three o’clock
with an American Quarter Horse

14:01.382 --> 14:02.383
named Viceroy.

14:02.633 --> 14:06.595
And, if we hit it off,
I guess he’ll move here from North Dakota,

14:06.679 --> 14:09.473
where he currently lives
in semi-retirement from the rodeo.

14:10.599 --> 14:13.102
It’s a gift from Tex
for our six-month anniversary.

14:13.936 --> 14:16.689
I have to work on my lines
for the thing with Sheila. I--

14:16.772 --> 14:19.191
No, please! I’ll run them with you.
Come on, come on.

14:19.441 --> 14:20.317
I'm late.

14:21.026 --> 14:21.986
[quietly] Please.

14:23.737 --> 14:25.364
-Fine.
-[Debbie] Yes!

14:25.823 --> 14:27.449
[horse neighs]

14:29.618 --> 14:31.328
[Debbie] Whoa, too fast, too fast.

14:31.829 --> 14:33.122
[Ruth] You’re fine.

14:34.331 --> 14:35.249
Just talk to me

14:35.332 --> 14:37.626
so I stop thinking about falling off
this horse and breaking my neck.

14:40.337 --> 14:43.048
I think Sheila might be a good actor.

14:43.382 --> 14:44.300
Better than me.

14:44.383 --> 14:46.927
It’s not a competition, Ruth.
It’s a scene for a charity ball.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.430
You should have seen her
navigate that scene.

14:49.513 --> 14:51.849
She had... all the right instincts.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.017
It was like...

14:53.183 --> 14:56.437
she was on a black diamond,
and I was on the bunny slopes.

14:56.520 --> 14:59.523
You need to stop comparing yourself
to other people.

14:59.732 --> 15:03.402
Well, it’s hard when you’re sharing a room
with a young Shirley MacLaine.

15:04.862 --> 15:07.156
Sheila says
the ball might not happen anyway.

15:07.781 --> 15:11.785
Bobby’s supposedly a disaster with money,
which is probably for the best.

15:11.869 --> 15:15.372
Then nobody will hear me do
a terrible Western drawl.

15:15.497 --> 15:16.373
[Debbie] Ruth.

15:16.874 --> 15:17.708
What?

15:18.000 --> 15:19.501
You’re supposed to be helping me.

15:19.877 --> 15:21.253
Wanna give him a little kick?

15:21.337 --> 15:22.922
Uh... Okay.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.800
-Whoa! Oh, my God!

15:31.555 --> 15:33.766
See? You don't need my help.

15:37.561 --> 15:39.104
[chuckles]

15:39.396 --> 15:40.689
[Ruth] You’re a natural.

15:41.899 --> 15:43.651
-[Debbie] That was kinda fun!
-[man] Good job.

15:43.734 --> 15:45.235
I like it!

15:50.074 --> 15:52.242
It's definitely weird seeing you
on a horse.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.495
I know. It's like a Jordache commercial.

15:55.079 --> 15:56.747
Oh. Thank you, Miranda.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.835
No, I mean, um...

16:02.878 --> 16:08.258
you know, we came to Vegas
to do a wrestling show, and...

16:08.884 --> 16:10.886
now I’m stuck in a loop, and...

16:11.303 --> 16:14.807
you put on a whole new life,
and it fits you.

16:15.224 --> 16:16.892
It is not a whole new life.

16:17.309 --> 16:21.021
Debbie, you’re dating a rich rancher,
he bought you a horse,

16:21.105 --> 16:23.482
and we’re sitting on his porch
being served tea.

16:24.441 --> 16:25.275
Mm-hmm.

16:26.485 --> 16:29.029
I mean, I know
things have always moved faster

16:29.113 --> 16:30.114
for you, but...

16:30.572 --> 16:33.409
[sighs] I wish we could just go back to LA

16:33.492 --> 16:36.036
and find a little theater and do a play.

16:36.245 --> 16:39.790
We could do <i>True West,</i> you and me.
We could do <i>'night, Mother.</i>

16:39.873 --> 16:42.251
God, that sounds awful.<i> </i>

16:42.334 --> 16:43.335
[chuckles]

16:44.044 --> 16:45.421
What? It does!

16:45.629 --> 16:50.384
I mean, if-- if we were, uh, 25, fine,
but I want my life...

16:50.926 --> 16:53.053
to get bigger, not smaller.

16:54.888 --> 16:57.224
And I don’t care about playing
all the great roles.

16:57.307 --> 16:58.767
I mean, it’s not realistic.

16:59.476 --> 17:03.147
So, if Liberty Belle was the last part
you ever played, you’d be fine?

17:03.230 --> 17:04.148
I would.

17:04.648 --> 17:07.735
And I have a lot of other exciting things
on my plate right now.

17:07.943 --> 17:10.279
-Like what, producing?
-Yeah.

17:10.696 --> 17:11.613
Come on.

17:13.615 --> 17:15.367
You keep saying you wanna do a project
of your own,

17:15.451 --> 17:17.661
but you're clearly not doing anything
to make that happen.

17:20.873 --> 17:21.790
[Debbie scoffs]

17:22.332 --> 17:23.375
Sorry.

17:25.794 --> 17:27.629

17:28.589 --> 17:31.467
Um, yeah, sure.
We only have an hour, though.

17:32.509 --> 17:34.136
I thought Tex was off on a business trip.

17:34.720 --> 17:38.307
He is, but he’s getting back for dinner,
and I haven’t seen him in a week.

17:39.516 --> 17:42.603
So, you brought me all the way out here?
How am I supposed to get back?

17:42.686 --> 17:44.855
I’ll have Bob drive you, it’s fine.

17:44.938 --> 17:46.065

And it’s gross.

and that was Denise’s other option.

Hey, nudes make fast cash.
