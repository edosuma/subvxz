WEBVTT

00:15.249 --> 00:17.251
Previously on The White
Princess...

00:17.751 --> 00:21.089
Now that you have Arthur,
you are joined with us.

00:21.455 --> 00:22.523
And any threat against Henry

00:22.623 --> 00:24.725
is a threat against
our boy as well.

00:24.825 --> 00:26.127
Don't be fooled by her.

00:26.227 --> 00:28.296
She's formidable
and quite the politician.

00:28.562 --> 00:31.065
The King would have
peace with Burgundy.

00:31.165 --> 00:32.433
Where is my mother?

00:32.533 --> 00:34.702
My mother proved
she was behind
the Lovell plot to kill me.

00:34.802 --> 00:36.637
She wanted Teddy
on the throne...

00:37.271 --> 00:38.372
If my mother
brings an army,

00:38.472 --> 00:40.474
how can I choose between
my mother and my son?

00:40.574 --> 00:43.511
Perhaps a York and Tudor union
might grow to be a fashion.

00:43.611 --> 00:46.013
Oh! There was no game
that you could win?

00:46.114 --> 00:48.116
If it makes you feel
better, we will have one race.

00:48.216 --> 00:50.050
I assume
she is an expert rider.

00:50.151 --> 00:51.185
Never beaten.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.055
Mary?

00:55.156 --> 00:56.857
I am sorry for your loss.
Get out.

01:58.586 --> 02:00.588
*

02:02.423 --> 02:03.857
It's been two days.

02:04.892 --> 02:07.595
Will you not have
something small to eat?

02:09.663 --> 02:11.265
My poor girl.

02:15.469 --> 02:16.537
Come now.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.307
Or those children
will have no one.

02:20.441 --> 02:23.211
Their father is too deep
in grief to notice them.

03:16.297 --> 03:17.331
Grand-mere?

03:23.937 --> 03:25.273
We eat

03:26.407 --> 03:27.941
and then we plan.

03:30.278 --> 03:32.913
The Tudors take from us
the people we love.

03:37.451 --> 03:39.620
They disturb our peace

03:40.688 --> 03:42.790
and now we will
disturb theirs.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.297
Elizabeth will have her war.

03:56.470 --> 03:57.471
**

04:02.776 --> 04:04.745
*

04:17.991 --> 04:19.327
Allow me.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.008
Here...

04:55.496 --> 04:57.398
Your uncle is returned
from Burgundy.

04:57.798 --> 04:58.832
Quickly now.

04:59.667 --> 05:00.968
That doesn't annoy you?

05:01.402 --> 05:02.936
Just a door between
your room and hers?

05:03.036 --> 05:04.372
Something's wrong.

05:08.842 --> 05:11.545
Look, how could it have
gone so wrong?

05:11.645 --> 05:13.647
When the girl died...
Who died?

05:14.047 --> 05:15.749
Our aunt's
step-daughter Mary.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.017
It was an accident.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.653
Yet, they blamed us.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.722
Why, if you were
not to blame?

05:21.989 --> 05:24.958
There was
a competition which...

05:25.058 --> 05:26.560
It was
the girl's own fault.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.796
She... She had to win at
everything. And yours.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.565
If you hadn't been so
wrapped up in the Duchess,

05:31.665 --> 05:32.700
then it might have
been avoided.

05:32.800 --> 05:33.867
"Wrapped up?"

05:33.967 --> 05:35.769
He was "attentive" to her.

05:35.869 --> 05:38.739
We should maintain
the course that we are on.

05:38.839 --> 05:43.010
My Lady The King's Mother
is already making matches
for the York girls

05:43.677 --> 05:44.945
with the Tudor nobles.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.314
So they may not
be snatched from us

05:47.415 --> 05:49.450
and used to breed York heirs.

05:49.817 --> 05:51.619
We do not know
what the Duchess will do.

05:51.919 --> 05:53.020
She may do nothing.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.989
We should be ready
but not think the worst.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.929
*

06:12.573 --> 06:13.674
Margaret?

06:26.720 --> 06:27.921
You're angry with me.

06:29.490 --> 06:30.991
As I am with myself.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.961
We were so close...

06:34.061 --> 06:36.797
I do not wish to hear
how close you were!

06:40.568 --> 06:42.536
So close to peace.

06:47.775 --> 06:49.677
What was it
you thought I meant?

06:53.481 --> 06:54.915
She is a York!

06:55.015 --> 06:56.484
Of all things.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.952
How could you
even think to...

07:08.161 --> 07:09.196
Lizzie?

07:09.630 --> 07:10.598
**

07:10.698 --> 07:11.899
I heard about
the accident.

07:12.533 --> 07:13.834
I am sorry for our aunt...

07:19.640 --> 07:20.841
Could this not be good?

07:21.041 --> 07:22.109
For Teddy?

07:22.710 --> 07:24.812
If the Duchess turns
against the Tudors,

07:24.912 --> 07:26.514
perhaps she'll send some
men to rescue him...

07:26.580 --> 07:27.848
It is bad, Maggie.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.684
Henry is more
fearful than before.

07:31.719 --> 07:32.953
The threat against
the Tudors

07:33.053 --> 07:35.856
means my sisters must
now also be locked
away in marriages.

07:36.824 --> 07:38.191
We must all be
turned to Tudors.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.693
Me as well?

07:39.793 --> 07:42.663
You are another York
princess whose children
could be heirs.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.433
Well, who will
I be wed to?
I don't know yet.

07:46.534 --> 07:48.135
Will I live
near Westminster?

07:48.936 --> 07:50.070
You'll not make me
go away from Teddy?

07:50.170 --> 07:52.606
I have told Henry I shall
influence the matches.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.042
His mother will not be
let loose to match you all

07:55.142 --> 07:56.777
with beasts or peasants.

07:57.545 --> 07:59.079
I will make a stand
against his mother.

08:00.681 --> 08:01.782
I will do my best for you.

08:07.621 --> 08:09.623
*

08:21.969 --> 08:23.070
Thank you for coming.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.038
I am sorry for your loss.

08:26.974 --> 08:28.175
You have the English boys?

08:29.309 --> 08:30.578
I do.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.113
*

08:59.306 --> 09:00.608
**

09:00.674 --> 09:01.709
Go on, lad.

09:01.809 --> 09:02.943
Just as we practiced.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.778
My name is Teddy,
Your Grace.

09:05.278 --> 09:07.247
It is an honor to meet
you, Your Grace.

09:08.015 --> 09:10.884
This one looks
most like Teddy.

09:11.151 --> 09:13.854
No one outside of England
knows what Teddy looks like.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.289
They'll accept
whoever's by my side.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.091
*

09:19.326 --> 09:22.195
This boy has
an innocent face,
but he's determined.

09:22.295 --> 09:23.797
He won't shy away.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.634
To whom does he belong?

09:37.878 --> 09:39.680
"To my sister-in-law,
Elizabeth.

09:40.781 --> 09:43.784
"I can only beg forgiveness
that I haven't written sooner.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.921
"My shock at Mary's passing
has left me too bereft.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.123
Inside then, girls.

09:50.223 --> 09:51.659
"I've learned that you are now

09:51.725 --> 09:52.960
"a prisoner in
Bermondsey Abbey

09:53.060 --> 09:55.062
"and have no means to write.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.131
"But I still have
my friends in England

09:58.231 --> 10:00.267
"and have made arrangements
for ink and paper

10:00.367 --> 10:01.835
"to be brought to you.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.336
Lady Mother?

10:03.436 --> 10:04.872
"You will need
to write to Ireland."

10:05.673 --> 10:06.707
**

10:06.807 --> 10:07.908
Lizzie, look.

10:08.341 --> 10:10.210
This is me, the Queen,

10:10.310 --> 10:12.145
with my intended,
John Welles.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.115
The pawns are our sisters
and this is our cousin Maggie.

10:15.215 --> 10:18.618
And this is baby Arthur.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.054
Arthur is too young
to be betrothed.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.123
But the King has said
that he will win for him

10:23.223 --> 10:26.827
the hand of
the Spanish princess,
Catherine of Aragon.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.963
Best ally to guard
against your aunt.

10:30.063 --> 10:32.900
We may discuss it but
we will not bind him to it.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.235
I will choose
Maggie's husband.

10:35.703 --> 10:36.904
It is decided.

10:37.104 --> 10:38.271
Not by me and I am Queen.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.808
And I shall take
the Queen's rooms now.

10:40.908 --> 10:45.312
She is to marry
Henry's loyal
commander, Richard Pole.

10:47.414 --> 10:48.782
The family have
been notified.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.117
Pole is beneath her.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.185
And you will move out today.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.755
They say
he is a vicious brute

10:54.855 --> 10:56.356
who lost his arm and
half the fingers on his hand

10:56.456 --> 10:58.225
but still fought on!

10:58.491 --> 11:01.061
The King has blessed
the marriage
and it is settled.

11:01.461 --> 11:05.733
As am I, in rooms
the King gave me himself.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.739
Jasper Tudor needs a wife.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.040
*

11:13.974 --> 11:16.744
My mother's sister
Kate is wealthy
from her late husband

11:16.810 --> 11:18.746
and will bring funds
to Henry's cause.

11:21.481 --> 11:22.816
I will suggest it.

11:46.439 --> 11:48.976
Henry, your mother
must be removed from
the Queen's rooms now.

11:49.076 --> 11:50.277
Oh, forget the rooms.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.079
They're saying
your cousin has
escaped from the Tower.

11:52.179 --> 11:53.180
**

11:53.280 --> 11:54.347
What?

11:58.551 --> 11:59.987
Take me home.

12:04.157 --> 12:05.492
I don't understand.

12:06.159 --> 12:08.295
Why would people say
he is free if he is not?

12:09.129 --> 12:11.131
It will be Burgundy
stirring up unrest.

12:11.431 --> 12:12.933
But what unrest?

12:13.266 --> 12:15.402
How does it help them
to say that he is free?

12:17.337 --> 12:19.406
They are claiming
that they have him there.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.976
Using his name to raise
an army against me.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.144
No.

12:24.344 --> 12:25.813
Teddy could never...

12:25.913 --> 12:28.148
Maybe not. But my enemies
don't know that.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.449
*

12:29.549 --> 12:31.018
And he is a York heir.

12:35.488 --> 12:38.391
Lizzie, please.

12:40.227 --> 12:41.428
Help him.

12:44.031 --> 12:44.998
**

12:45.098 --> 12:46.199
If Burgundy is behind this,

12:46.299 --> 12:47.901
then prove that
they are wrong.

12:48.335 --> 12:49.937
Cecily will be married soon.

12:50.037 --> 12:51.438
Let us have Teddy
at the wedding.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.008
If we show that
he is living with us,

12:55.108 --> 12:57.177
a valued member
of our household,

12:57.610 --> 13:00.848
then he cannot be in Burgundy
raising men against you.

13:01.548 --> 13:03.851
All those who say he is
will be proven liars.

13:03.951 --> 13:05.185
And I suppose that
after the wedding

13:05.285 --> 13:07.855
you will say that we must
keep him from the
Tower and with us?

13:08.989 --> 13:10.858
Well, if it goes
well, why not?

13:11.524 --> 13:13.326
He is just a child, Henry.

13:14.094 --> 13:16.196
You have seen
how scared he is,

13:17.197 --> 13:18.331
how lonely and unloved.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.200
Can you say you have
never felt that?

13:20.400 --> 13:21.401
*

13:22.002 --> 13:23.570
You are better than this.

13:24.437 --> 13:26.406
Don't be so threatened
by a child...

13:27.941 --> 13:29.176
Show the world
the man you are

13:29.276 --> 13:30.878
and let him live
with us again.

13:34.181 --> 13:36.083
Thank you, Henry.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.188
Do I look beautiful?

13:41.588 --> 13:43.223
I must look beautiful.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.093
Lizzie, are you
happy for me?

13:49.897 --> 13:52.232
You and I will walk behind
Lizzie and the King.

13:52.332 --> 13:53.433
Outside?

13:53.967 --> 13:55.268
Yes, Teddy. Outside.

13:56.904 --> 13:58.438
But it's very important

13:59.439 --> 14:01.574
that we're good
and do not make a sound.

14:02.609 --> 14:03.944
Do you understand?

14:05.578 --> 14:06.613
**

14:08.015 --> 14:09.449
It is preposterous.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.452
To counter that the boy
is free, he frees him.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.922
It is madness!

14:16.489 --> 14:18.558
It is the Queen's madness.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.297
Enough!

14:28.435 --> 14:30.037
It is enough.

14:30.137 --> 14:32.005
*

14:33.306 --> 14:34.574
Bishop Morton?

14:35.708 --> 14:37.477
My Lady The King's Mother.

14:39.612 --> 14:41.314
You have someone
in the crowd?

14:41.414 --> 14:44.651
The boy will soon
be thrown back
into the Tower.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.996
- God save the King!
- God save the King!

14:56.096 --> 14:58.131
"Hooray for King Henry!"

14:59.299 --> 15:00.533
"God bless you sire."

15:00.633 --> 15:03.971
- Princess Cecily!
- Princess Cecily!

15:04.504 --> 15:06.006
Princess Cecily!

15:31.131 --> 15:32.065
**

15:32.165 --> 15:33.433
King Warwick,
we support you!

15:33.533 --> 15:35.135
Warwick! I'm Warwick.

15:35.235 --> 15:38.005
Shh!
King Warwick!
King Warwick!

15:38.038 --> 15:39.572
What's the boy saying? Guards?

15:40.140 --> 15:41.308
King Warwick!

15:44.144 --> 15:45.645
Guards, get the boy.

15:49.616 --> 15:52.019
No. No, please.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.086
Get back!

15:53.320 --> 15:54.287
Keep away from him.

15:54.387 --> 15:55.355
You will not harm him!

15:55.688 --> 15:57.190
York is the true king!

15:57.290 --> 15:58.325
De la Pole!

15:58.425 --> 15:59.492
York!

16:00.160 --> 16:01.128
York!

16:02.629 --> 16:03.630
Traitor!

16:07.034 --> 16:08.468
No! Where are you
taking him?
Get him.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.470
Take him down.

16:11.038 --> 16:12.039
Where are you taking him?

16:13.140 --> 16:14.241
It's not his fault!

16:17.377 --> 16:19.079
It's supposed to be
my wedding day!

16:19.179 --> 16:22.049
Grab the child.
Ah, get off me!

16:22.082 --> 16:23.450
*

16:25.452 --> 16:26.486
You're safe.

16:34.627 --> 16:35.628
One voice.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.697
That's all it took.
One woman crying out

16:37.797 --> 16:39.566
and men
that swore fealty
turn against me.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.334
John de la Pole.

16:41.568 --> 16:42.969
Just one,
not all of your men.

16:43.070 --> 16:44.071
The other
de la Poles
have fled.

16:44.737 --> 16:45.738
Who else is against me?

16:46.839 --> 16:49.442
It's a pox that
spreads like a plague

16:49.542 --> 16:51.478
and whispers
in men's ears,
"Rise up!

16:52.612 --> 16:53.580
"For no one loves the King!

16:53.680 --> 16:55.115
"Rise up and
spread this poison."

16:57.350 --> 16:58.418
This has done me harm.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.389
And it was your idea.

17:03.490 --> 17:05.792
You cannot think
that I wanted this.

17:07.294 --> 17:09.396
All I wanted was my cousin
from the Tower

17:09.496 --> 17:11.398
and now he is back inside.

17:12.732 --> 17:15.001
It is neither his fault
nor mine.

17:15.102 --> 17:16.669
It is Elizabeth,
your mother's.

17:17.104 --> 17:18.105
What?

17:19.106 --> 17:20.473
She must have
instructed de la Pole

17:20.573 --> 17:22.509
to snatch the boy
to hand to Burgundy.

17:23.176 --> 17:25.545
My mother is in Bermondsey and
she is watched night and day.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.480
The woman who set off
the crowd was paid to do it.

17:28.415 --> 17:29.482
You must have seen it, Henry.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.318
She did her job
and she fled.

17:32.519 --> 17:34.354
Elizabeth will strike again.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.725
There is only one way
to ensure she doesn't...

17:39.259 --> 17:40.227
What?

17:41.161 --> 17:42.162
What way?

17:42.529 --> 17:44.664
Silence her forever, Henry,

17:44.764 --> 17:46.433
and Burgundy will lose
their agent

17:46.533 --> 17:48.568
and their links to all
your enemies.

17:49.369 --> 17:52.272
Cut off the head
and the snake will die.

17:56.476 --> 17:57.477
Henry?

18:00.680 --> 18:01.714
No, she is my mother.

18:01.814 --> 18:03.750
She is our son's grandmother!

18:04.284 --> 18:05.852
All of England laughs
behind my back.

18:06.353 --> 18:09.222
I am a fool to them,
that has no love
from any man.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.160
Do you not
think that I would
kill for that?

18:15.695 --> 18:18.165
I would kill
for less than that.

18:29.309 --> 18:31.811
*

18:50.830 --> 18:53.566
Please tell Henry
it wasn't Teddy's fault.

18:53.666 --> 18:54.667
He didn't mean it.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.404
He always says that
when someone
calls out to him.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.209
Lizzie?
I am sorry, Maggie.

19:03.410 --> 19:04.477
Well, then will you
try to help him?

19:04.744 --> 19:05.778
The best thing
you can do is

19:05.878 --> 19:07.747
be obedient to
your marriage plans.

19:08.348 --> 19:10.283
And pray for patience.

19:11.518 --> 19:12.519
Do you know now?

19:13.886 --> 19:14.854
Who he is?

19:16.456 --> 19:17.424
He is a soldier.

19:19.492 --> 19:20.893
He is not a man
I have met.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.233
He lives in Wales.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.302
You did not make
the choice then?

19:30.537 --> 19:31.538
Lady Margaret did.

19:42.415 --> 19:43.850
More wine for my ladies.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.653
It is a wedding after all

19:47.820 --> 19:49.456
and we shall celebrate.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.674
You are recovered
from them?

20:11.911 --> 20:15.615
The King tells me the Queen
would have me wed.

20:20.787 --> 20:23.623
She wishes to
draw attention from
her own sister.

20:27.026 --> 20:29.362
If it would benefit
the King then...

20:29.696 --> 20:32.765
I will do whatever
is asked of me,
but if not, then...

20:35.602 --> 20:36.869
I would sooner...

20:38.004 --> 20:40.373
Have my leave
to stay at court.

20:43.343 --> 20:44.444
At court?

20:46.846 --> 20:48.915
I would like us
to speak plainly, Margaret.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.257
Dance, wife?

21:30.790 --> 21:31.791
**

21:32.725 --> 21:34.361
*

22:47.934 --> 22:48.901
**

22:58.878 --> 23:01.113
The Flemish troops
are paid for and in place.

23:01.614 --> 23:03.516
They ready the
fleet as we speak.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.084
And the Irish?
Are they with us?

23:05.785 --> 23:07.454
Did Elizabeth's letter
do its work?

23:07.520 --> 23:08.488
It did.

23:08.588 --> 23:10.457
Kildare and others
pledge their armies.

23:11.057 --> 23:12.058
Lambert!

23:13.693 --> 23:14.661
No!

23:18.831 --> 23:19.932
Why do you look at me?

23:21.367 --> 23:22.469
- You said...
- I said "Lambert."

23:22.869 --> 23:23.870
Who is "Lambert?"

23:24.604 --> 23:26.105
You are Edward,
Earl of Warwick.

23:27.607 --> 23:29.141
What name do you
answer to, Edward?

23:29.942 --> 23:31.611
Why so much time
on the sword?

23:32.679 --> 23:35.114
Surely comportment lessons
would serve him better.

23:36.015 --> 23:38.050
He must have
the rudiments
of defense

23:38.250 --> 23:40.052
or he won't
last in battle.

23:40.152 --> 23:41.120
Battle?

23:42.154 --> 23:43.790
She's not sending
him into battle,

23:43.890 --> 23:45.091
he's all of
10 years old.

23:45.958 --> 23:48.495
She'll set him on a horse
and he'll rouse the men

23:48.595 --> 23:50.930
and that'll be
the end of it.

23:51.030 --> 23:53.933
My Lady, the boy is
of little use

23:54.033 --> 23:56.703
unless he leads the
army into England.

24:02.241 --> 24:03.910
If you are nervous,

24:05.044 --> 24:07.514
you give your
opponent signs.

24:07.847 --> 24:09.582
He will take advantage.

24:11.751 --> 24:13.085
No matter what
you feel inside,

24:13.185 --> 24:16.956
you must always show
a brave face to the world.

24:17.223 --> 24:18.925
You must not show fear.

24:19.859 --> 24:20.860
Do you understand?

24:20.960 --> 24:21.961
*

24:22.662 --> 24:23.663
Good.

24:24.296 --> 24:25.698
Now tell me your name.

24:25.798 --> 24:26.799
Teddy.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.536
And what makes you
special, Teddy?

24:29.869 --> 24:31.971
I am the rightful
King of England.

24:32.605 --> 24:35.141
Now show me
what you can do
with that sword.

24:44.183 --> 24:47.119
"And I send you my
most heartfelt thanks.

24:48.220 --> 24:50.723
"For coming to our aid."

25:01.701 --> 25:03.102
It's Lizzie!

25:03.202 --> 25:04.170
Lizzie!

25:07.707 --> 25:08.675
Lizzie!

25:10.977 --> 25:11.911
Lizzie!

25:12.011 --> 25:13.012
**

25:13.112 --> 25:14.914
I'm sorry that I
didn't come sooner.

25:15.648 --> 25:16.783
But you're here now.

25:20.152 --> 25:21.153
How's Arthur?

25:21.988 --> 25:22.989
He is well.

25:23.856 --> 25:24.957
I would have
brought him but...

25:25.357 --> 25:26.659
Henry doesn't know
you're here?

25:26.859 --> 25:27.827
No.

25:29.228 --> 25:31.097
Look at you, Anne!

25:31.197 --> 25:32.298
How much you've grown.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.668
I swear you're almost
as tall as me.

25:35.768 --> 25:36.769
How did you get in?

25:38.738 --> 25:39.706
The monks.

25:42.609 --> 25:43.610
They let you through?

25:44.744 --> 25:46.045
I am Queen now,
I command them.

25:46.278 --> 25:47.279
Well, tell
me everything.

25:51.150 --> 25:52.151
Are you well?

25:53.519 --> 25:55.622
What news from
Burgundy? Does my
aunt send help to us?

25:56.022 --> 25:57.123
I hoped that
you would tell me.

25:58.157 --> 25:59.826
You write to her.
Surely you must know?

26:00.159 --> 26:02.061
I can get nothing
in or out.

26:02.662 --> 26:03.630
For the first
time in my life,

26:03.730 --> 26:05.865
I am bereft of
letters and of news.

26:06.633 --> 26:08.067
Tell me, please.

26:08.901 --> 26:10.169
What of the Tudor court?

26:11.403 --> 26:12.639
Your marriage.

26:14.106 --> 26:16.843
Would you still push him
from the throne?

26:18.110 --> 26:19.712
You are truly not in
touch with anyone?

26:20.179 --> 26:23.049
Even the boy who used
to take my messages
for me has gone away.

26:23.382 --> 26:26.118
Margaret is convinced
you are the cause
of Henry's troubles.

26:28.287 --> 26:29.288
She would have you dead.

26:29.388 --> 26:30.556
Of course she would.

26:30.657 --> 26:32.191
No, Mother, this is not
an idle threat.

26:32.291 --> 26:33.660
This time he means it.

26:34.360 --> 26:35.895
*

26:35.995 --> 26:38.364
He believes you planned for
Teddy to be snatched
and used against us.

26:40.733 --> 26:41.734
I know nothing of it.

26:42.334 --> 26:44.103
If I knew what my aunt
had planned,

26:44.203 --> 26:45.772
then maybe I could
talk him round.

26:48.074 --> 26:50.877
If you know anything,
please, help me.

26:55.047 --> 26:56.015
I have no power anymore.

26:57.850 --> 27:00.052
I have these four walls and
your sisters, and that is all.

27:28.748 --> 27:32.084
Henry...
Even you.
Even you.

27:32.184 --> 27:33.720
I was just...
I know what
you were doing.

27:33.786 --> 27:35.021
I have you followed.

27:35.121 --> 27:37.790
And I am proven right too
because you went
to see your mother.

27:37.890 --> 27:39.258
Did you really think

27:39.358 --> 27:41.360
you could just slip into
the abbey where I keep her

27:41.460 --> 27:42.829
if I did not permit it?

27:43.996 --> 27:48.000
You lied to me and you are
as treacherous as she is.

27:48.868 --> 27:49.902
Henry.

27:51.303 --> 27:52.338
Henry.

27:52.438 --> 27:54.807
I went to see my mother, yes.

27:55.307 --> 27:58.244
Because you said
you would execute her.

27:58.745 --> 28:01.447
I went behind your back,
but it was to help us.

28:01.881 --> 28:03.950
To see if she is plotting
with Burgundy.

28:04.316 --> 28:05.417
And is she?

28:06.252 --> 28:07.219
I don't know.

28:08.020 --> 28:10.089
Because she
told me nothing.

28:12.324 --> 28:15.027
Because my mother
no longer trusts me.

28:16.763 --> 28:19.966
She saw before I did myself
that I am Tudor now.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.836
The birth of Arthur makes me
so whether I like it or not

28:23.936 --> 28:26.372
because I will never
stand against him.

28:27.473 --> 28:30.142
Our son puts me
on your side forever.

28:32.078 --> 28:33.980
You may disbelieve it
if you choose...

28:36.248 --> 28:37.416
but you are all I have now.

28:39.952 --> 28:41.954
Our family
is all I have and...

28:44.891 --> 28:46.926
If you don't trust me...

29:02.141 --> 29:04.210
I want to go home.
I want my father.

29:04.877 --> 29:06.813
You're not going home.

29:06.846 --> 29:08.047
You're going to war.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.084
**

29:12.184 --> 29:13.352
It isn't even rough.

29:14.286 --> 29:16.188
There's barely
any heave at all!

29:20.492 --> 29:23.262
How do you intend to
protect him in battle?

29:24.230 --> 29:26.232
Lovell and de la Pole
will be there with him.

29:27.099 --> 29:28.400
Have a care.

29:28.968 --> 29:30.469
He's just a child.

29:31.137 --> 29:34.040
He's a child that
will bring down
the Tudor King.

29:35.574 --> 29:37.243
Or is that not
what you wanted?

29:37.343 --> 29:39.178
I will not be witness
to this battle.

29:40.847 --> 29:43.916
When you sail to England,
I will return to Burgundy.

29:44.016 --> 29:45.384
*

29:47.119 --> 29:49.021
They have
arrived in Ireland with
a fleet of ships

29:49.121 --> 29:51.323
and 2,000
Flemish mercenaries.

29:51.590 --> 29:53.359
The Irish have welcomed
them with open arms

29:53.459 --> 29:55.361
and they are
preparing to invade.

29:56.929 --> 29:59.331
I must fight to save
my crown against
a peasant boy.

30:00.900 --> 30:01.901
When do you ride out?

30:05.404 --> 30:06.472
Dawn.

30:14.146 --> 30:15.347
My Lady, Margaret.

30:16.983 --> 30:17.950
**

30:19.151 --> 30:20.552
Will you walk with me?

30:22.654 --> 30:23.822
Of course.

30:35.367 --> 30:39.305
What I, um, tried to
say to you before

30:39.405 --> 30:43.542
was that what I found
in Burgundy was...

30:43.642 --> 30:45.544
Please, Jasper...

30:47.646 --> 30:49.848
Was nothing more than
the truth about myself.

30:50.917 --> 30:53.986
My life has been
a full one, Margaret,

30:55.321 --> 30:56.588
but it has been lonely.

31:00.292 --> 31:01.928
You wish to marry.

31:02.028 --> 31:03.229
I... I do not.

31:03.429 --> 31:04.931
Well, I would.

31:07.199 --> 31:09.201
If circumstances allowed.

31:12.304 --> 31:14.840
You told me once

31:14.941 --> 31:17.143
that your marriage
to Lord Stanley

31:17.343 --> 31:19.946
was for us to put
our boy upon the throne.

31:20.546 --> 31:23.082
That's right.
If this is
the truth of it...

31:23.715 --> 31:27.419
Then the Church
permits annulments,

31:28.087 --> 31:29.855
does it not?

31:29.956 --> 31:31.357
If the marriage isn't...

31:31.690 --> 31:34.060
I... I do not wish
to cause embarrassment,

31:34.160 --> 31:35.494
to you or to myself.

31:37.096 --> 31:38.530
Your faith, it is
the essence of you.

31:38.630 --> 31:42.001
So, if I speak
out of turn, then
you must tell me.

31:48.474 --> 31:51.010
We have lived our
lives for Henry.

31:52.478 --> 31:54.480
And I do not regret
a moment of it.

31:56.648 --> 32:00.186
But now, in
twilight years...

32:06.092 --> 32:07.193
Might we not venture

32:08.294 --> 32:10.997
to cherish something
for ourselves?

32:13.065 --> 32:15.067
Will you think on it
while I am gone?

32:15.734 --> 32:17.003
That's all I ask.

32:33.585 --> 32:35.287
*

33:13.725 --> 33:16.628
I thought you would like
to say goodbye to him.

33:18.297 --> 33:20.332
There's something
that I wish to ask you.

33:23.702 --> 33:25.271
Do not fight.

33:27.073 --> 33:29.175
You would have me stay here?

33:29.741 --> 33:30.709
Let them storm the gate?

33:30.809 --> 33:32.411
Of course not.

33:33.512 --> 33:37.083
Lead your men onto the field
but do not risk your own life.

33:37.616 --> 33:39.318
Do not fight in person.

33:39.618 --> 33:41.387
If I died,

33:43.222 --> 33:44.290
you would be rid of me.

33:45.257 --> 33:46.292
**

33:46.392 --> 33:50.296
Your mother safe, your cousin
free to take the throne.

33:54.433 --> 33:56.702
How can I prove to you
that I am with you,

33:56.802 --> 33:58.770
except to ask
you not to die?

34:05.311 --> 34:06.812
*

34:08.480 --> 34:10.816
While you are on
the field and I am
at Maggie's wedding...

34:17.489 --> 34:18.590
Take this with you.

34:22.261 --> 34:24.463
Promise me
you will not fight.

34:24.863 --> 34:26.132
Come home.

34:28.267 --> 34:29.601
So we can start
our life together.

36:07.233 --> 36:08.834
*

37:06.925 --> 37:07.893
Charge!

39:35.741 --> 39:37.809
You go ahead.

39:41.112 --> 39:42.080
Could you take him?

39:42.180 --> 39:43.348
Of course.

39:43.449 --> 39:44.450
Thank you.

39:54.726 --> 39:56.462
"My dearest Lizzie.

39:57.062 --> 40:00.466
"Yes, I have the
means to write

40:00.499 --> 40:01.800
"and I know how
that will hurt you."

40:04.803 --> 40:05.904
She is writing letters.

40:06.004 --> 40:07.072
Who
is writing letters?

40:08.039 --> 40:09.040
Our mother.

40:10.942 --> 40:12.644
Of course she is.

40:12.744 --> 40:13.745
*

40:15.080 --> 40:18.016
Lady Margaret said
it was her that
funded the York army.

40:20.018 --> 40:21.953
"But, there's something
I must tell you,

40:22.821 --> 40:24.155
"as painful as it is.

40:25.156 --> 40:27.659
"When you were first
with child, with Arthur,

40:28.059 --> 40:31.062
"I knew then
that he'd never
be the king.

40:33.098 --> 40:35.501
"I don't know where
my sight comes from,

40:36.502 --> 40:37.936
"but I could see it.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.772
"Curse me if you will.

40:41.540 --> 40:43.074
"And hold your boy close,

40:44.242 --> 40:47.746
"but Lizzie, you must
change allegiance

40:47.846 --> 40:50.048
"and back your brother's
claim for England.

40:50.749 --> 40:52.751
"I know he will return to us."

40:53.218 --> 40:54.486
What does she say?

40:54.586 --> 40:56.688
She is ill-wishing Arthur.

40:58.056 --> 41:00.726
She says he will not be king.
She is wishing him to die.

41:01.059 --> 41:02.761
Don't listen to her, Lizzie.

41:02.861 --> 41:04.563
She is only on
her own side. Never ours.

41:05.864 --> 41:08.066
She will say whichever words
best serve her own cause.

41:08.767 --> 41:09.968
Whether they're
true or not.

41:12.237 --> 41:15.574
Now, we must go
and help Maggie
with her marriage bed.

41:16.708 --> 41:18.176
She has no mother either.

41:44.936 --> 41:46.071
Lizzie?

41:46.972 --> 41:48.574
Will it hurt?

41:51.242 --> 41:52.210
A little bit.

41:52.878 --> 41:54.179
But then it feels quite nice.

42:21.740 --> 42:22.708
**

42:30.281 --> 42:31.282
My Lady Margaret.

42:33.652 --> 42:34.653
Sir Richard.

42:37.889 --> 42:39.658
An injury from Bosworth.

42:42.227 --> 42:43.695
It is a source
of guilt to me

42:43.795 --> 42:46.064
that I can no longer
fight in battle.

42:48.166 --> 42:49.868
And a torment
when the weather turns.

42:53.271 --> 42:55.841
My heart was beating
through my chest
inside the chapel. I...

42:57.909 --> 43:00.946
I do not like
to be, uh, the center
of attention.

43:01.847 --> 43:02.848
Nor I.

43:10.288 --> 43:11.556
Margaret.

43:11.657 --> 43:13.258
I know I am beneath you

43:15.126 --> 43:17.829
but I will try to be
a husband who's
worthy of your name.

43:18.830 --> 43:20.131
I do not want my name.

43:23.001 --> 43:24.870
Plantagenet is
hateful to me.

43:25.937 --> 43:28.339
All it means is danger
and a broken heart.

43:33.144 --> 43:34.880
Your brother, Edward...

43:37.448 --> 43:39.117
Must I live away from him?

43:39.217 --> 43:40.218
*

43:41.286 --> 43:42.287
I cannot bear to.

43:43.689 --> 43:45.156
Then we will often
be in London.

43:46.725 --> 43:49.127
You only have to ask
for what will make you happy.

43:50.295 --> 43:51.763
Oh, thank you.

43:55.767 --> 43:56.768
Maggie Pole.

44:00.872 --> 44:02.173
Everyone calls me Maggie.

44:23.394 --> 44:24.395
**

44:24.495 --> 44:25.797
You confuse me.

44:27.799 --> 44:29.801
I know that you love
Henry, and love God,

44:29.901 --> 44:31.837
and yet there is
so much hate in you.

44:34.139 --> 44:36.041
It is a shame you
didn't marry Jasper.

44:38.176 --> 44:40.078
Perhaps that
is your tragedy.

44:40.879 --> 44:42.781
My husband is
Sir Thomas Stanley!

44:42.881 --> 44:44.783
But Jasper is the
man you love.

44:45.050 --> 44:46.785
*

44:47.018 --> 44:48.053
Can you deny it?

44:48.153 --> 44:49.755
I have no tragedy.

44:52.323 --> 44:54.225
How dare you say
such things to me?

44:55.994 --> 44:59.030
You paint me with your
own sinful desires.

45:08.807 --> 45:09.841
Leave me.

45:36.334 --> 45:37.335
Lizzie!

45:37.435 --> 45:38.703
I have a message
from my husband.

45:38.804 --> 45:39.805
**

45:39.905 --> 45:41.206
We have won.

45:41.506 --> 45:43.241
Mother lost again.

45:44.209 --> 45:47.145
My husband says the King
has granted us permission
to leave court.

45:47.345 --> 45:49.347
We shall go and live
at his castle in the north.

45:52.083 --> 45:53.384
I hope you will be happy.

45:56.187 --> 45:58.189
I think I will be
happier than you.

45:58.857 --> 46:00.158
But you must come
and visit us.

46:01.827 --> 46:02.828
Goodbye, Lizzie.

46:03.261 --> 46:04.295
Goodbye.

46:14.339 --> 46:16.041
*

46:28.319 --> 46:29.320
Henry!

46:31.990 --> 46:33.859
His name is Lambert Simnel.

46:36.261 --> 46:39.397
Routing his army has caused
grave injury to my uncle.

46:42.067 --> 46:44.369
The traitor will
be dealt with.

46:45.436 --> 46:48.339
There is another traitor
in an abbey to attend to.

46:49.507 --> 46:52.878
They both should pay
the same price
for their treason.

46:59.150 --> 47:00.151
Lizzie?

47:10.195 --> 47:11.897
My Lady Margaret.

48:04.649 --> 48:05.850
**

48:05.951 --> 48:07.518
For the first time
since I won at Bosworth

48:07.618 --> 48:09.320
we have engaged in battle.

48:11.089 --> 48:12.290
And we slaughtered them.

48:12.991 --> 48:14.159
You slaughtered them.

48:15.593 --> 48:19.164
My loyal, true
and trusted men.

48:20.098 --> 48:22.968
I have my throne
because of you,
and I am grateful.

48:23.634 --> 48:25.036
You will be rewarded.

48:25.971 --> 48:27.005
But first,

48:28.506 --> 48:30.575
we must attend
to our two traitors.

48:33.411 --> 48:34.980
The boy who led the army.

48:36.747 --> 48:41.086
And the York woman
who has plotted against
me since I won the crown.

48:41.419 --> 48:42.988
Traitor!

48:44.389 --> 48:47.592
The penalty for
treason is death.

48:48.259 --> 48:49.227
So...

48:53.298 --> 48:54.332
Who would have me kill them?

49:05.010 --> 49:06.611
And who would not?

49:16.021 --> 49:17.322
I would not, Your Grace.

49:19.557 --> 49:20.525
*

49:23.428 --> 49:25.030
The boy is just a boy.

49:27.032 --> 49:29.434
A pawn for an adult game
that he doesn't understand.

49:31.369 --> 49:32.637
And Dowager Queen Elizabeth?

49:34.572 --> 49:35.540
The mother of the Queen?

49:37.542 --> 49:39.310
She has no excuse.

49:39.577 --> 49:42.747
She rallied the Irish.
Paid them in gold.

49:44.715 --> 49:47.752
And yet, here I am.
Undefeated.

49:51.789 --> 49:53.624
Their army barely
drew their swords.

49:54.325 --> 49:55.693
You cut through them
like barley.

49:58.663 --> 50:00.265
Please, Your Grace.

50:11.609 --> 50:13.978
The boy will be given a job
in the palace kitchens.

50:14.079 --> 50:15.046
He will turn the spit.

50:16.214 --> 50:18.483
And be thankful that he has
no need to return to a father

50:18.583 --> 50:21.018
who would sell him
for a keg of ale.
Henry...

50:21.319 --> 50:22.287
And you,

50:28.093 --> 50:29.460
may tell your mother,

50:31.096 --> 50:32.297
when next you visit her,

50:33.564 --> 50:36.601
that the King is in
rude health, and
sends his regards!

50:41.839 --> 50:43.040
Thank you, Henry.

50:46.677 --> 50:47.678
Thank you.

51:00.158 --> 51:01.159
**

51:24.282 --> 51:25.283
Jasper.

51:28.319 --> 51:29.854
I feared you were
avoiding me.

51:33.691 --> 51:35.160
I have found
a wife for you.

51:36.494 --> 51:37.762
Kate Woodville.

51:37.862 --> 51:39.464
The Dowager Queen's sister.

51:40.731 --> 51:43.168
The King has
given his blessing
to the marriage.

51:45.270 --> 51:46.637
Her fortune is significant.

51:48.439 --> 51:50.341
It will benefit
the Tudor cause.

51:57.515 --> 51:58.516
I see.

51:59.450 --> 52:01.386
We will see each other
at the Privy Council.

52:02.787 --> 52:04.289
And work for Henry's cause.

52:06.291 --> 52:07.425
As we have always done.

52:17.468 --> 52:18.869
*

52:50.501 --> 52:51.502
Come.

52:52.737 --> 52:54.472
I have something for you.

53:04.782 --> 53:06.684
I had my mother leave.

53:12.490 --> 53:13.458
You are the Queen.

53:13.724 --> 53:14.792
They are your rooms.

53:16.594 --> 53:18.429
I kept my promise, and
now you will keep yours.

53:18.529 --> 53:19.530
We will be happy.

53:24.402 --> 53:26.271
You know she won't
give up, don't you?

53:26.437 --> 53:28.373
My mother.
Lizzie, she has done
her worst.

53:29.274 --> 53:30.275
And look at us...

53:37.282 --> 53:38.283
We are still here.

54:27.532 --> 54:28.999
We have a guest.

54:36.607 --> 54:37.975
He arrived just
before you did.

54:40.345 --> 54:41.346
Richard?

54:45.049 --> 54:46.050
Is it really you?

54:48.586 --> 54:49.554
Oh.

54:51.956 --> 54:54.925
Our lost York Prince,
Richard...

54:58.028 --> 54:59.029
Is safe!

55:11.609 --> 55:12.577
**
