The following story is fictional and does
not depict any actual person or event.

00:05.606 --> 00:08.208
In New York City's war on crime,

00:08.208 --> 00:11.333
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:11.333 --> 00:13.144
of the Major Case Squad.

00:13.144 --> 00:15.112
These are their stories.

00:22.769 --> 00:24.453
Mrs. Khan, it's time.

00:45.502 --> 00:46.760
Patience.

00:46.760 --> 00:49.785
We've waited two years.
We can wait a few more minutes.

00:58.233 --> 01:01.801
Thank you so much. Thank you
so much for coming, my friends.

01:01.801 --> 01:03.812
Mrs. Khan, how does it feel to be free?

01:03.812 --> 01:05.959
So great to be came in
my second home.

01:05.959 --> 01:09.501
But I must be honest,
I will never feel free

01:09.501 --> 01:13.074
until there is a free
democratic Tamil homeland.

01:13.074 --> 01:16.349
As a condition of your release,
you promised to refrain
from political activity.

01:16.349 --> 01:18.485
This is a personal visit.

01:19.410 --> 01:22.736
My mother is elderly,
and not in good health.

01:22.736 --> 01:25.994
Does that mean you will not be working here
on behalf of Tamil independents?

01:25.994 --> 01:27.356
No more questions, thank you.

01:27.356 --> 01:31.607
Thank you.
Thank you so much for coming.

01:37.316 --> 01:39.156
Brother.

01:40.398 --> 01:43.446
You look well.
House arrest agrees with you.

01:43.446 --> 01:44.569
Gil, how have you been?

01:44.569 --> 01:46.901
Fine, Madame,
good to see you again.

01:48.687 --> 01:50.530
Where's my husband?
Is everything all right?

01:50.530 --> 01:53.106
Visa troubles.
Last-minute Snafu.

01:53.106 --> 01:55.300
He's, uh, flying in
from London this afternoon.

01:55.300 --> 01:57.582
I wanted to see him before the rally.

01:57.582 --> 02:01.236
Bela, maybe we should cancel.
You did promise them that you...

02:01.236 --> 02:04.521
Promises made to one's captors
are not meant to be kept.

02:04.521 --> 02:08.394
- There could be consequences...
- Yeah, what can they do to me?

02:08.394 --> 02:11.178
What they did to father.
And to our brother.

02:11.178 --> 02:15.193
Don't worry.
I'm here to see mother.

02:15.193 --> 02:16.728
And you.

02:20.233 --> 02:24.235
I thought I might die
without seeing you.

02:24.235 --> 02:25.898
You're not dying, mama.

02:25.898 --> 02:30.484
Of course I am.
That's why you're here.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.923
Aunt Bela?

02:33.417 --> 02:38.728
Jasmina? Look at you.
You're so beautiful.

02:39.227 --> 02:41.074
Are you all right?
Did they...

02:41.074 --> 02:43.805
Oh, I'm fine. How's Yale?

02:44.178 --> 02:46.699
- I love it.
- I'm so proud of you.

02:46.699 --> 02:48.019
I think we better...

02:48.019 --> 02:51.829
Mama, I must go.
I'll be back later to say goodnight.

02:53.755 --> 02:57.663
There has been too much
bloodshed on both sides.

02:57.663 --> 03:01.628
We will win our struggle
not with bombs and bullets,

03:01.628 --> 03:04.064
but through diplomacy.

03:04.064 --> 03:07.633
The only route to freedom
is through non-violence.

03:08.115 --> 03:09.468
Thank you.

03:10.425 --> 03:11.950
Thank you.

03:19.027 --> 03:20.639
Gil, get us out.

03:21.071 --> 03:23.338
- This way, Madame.
- Thank you so much.

03:52.024 --> 03:53.359
Gun!

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON USA: 2008/06/29

05:03.153 --> 05:05.527
That's the assassin
taken out by the bodyguard,

05:05.527 --> 05:08.540
but not before he gets a couple
of shots off at Bela Khan.

05:08.540 --> 05:11.858
The second shot
kills Rosemary Shah,

05:11.858 --> 05:14.755
Mrs. Khan's personal assistant.
Mrs. Khan is...

05:14.755 --> 05:16.846
Head of the Tamil Independence Movement.

05:16.846 --> 05:19.176
Short-listed for the Nobel Peace Prize,

05:19.176 --> 05:23.184
And under house arrest in Sri Lanka
for the last two years.

05:23.507 --> 05:25.346
We get newspapers too, you know.

05:25.676 --> 05:27.461
I just didn't know you read them.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.867
Mrs. Khan and her entourage
were leaving the rally

05:29.867 --> 05:31.518
through the kitchen to the back exit.

05:31.518 --> 05:33.427
And the shooter was waiting for them.

05:34.217 --> 05:36.117
Shades of Bobby Kennedy.

05:39.570 --> 05:40.842
FBI's on site.

05:40.842 --> 05:44.560
Turns out they met her at JFK,
but this event was under their radar.

05:44.560 --> 05:45.854
That won't happen again.

05:45.854 --> 05:48.132
They're taking responsibility
for Bela's security.

05:48.132 --> 05:49.868
Oh, good. Let them.

05:49.868 --> 05:53.342
But this murder happened in New York,
so it's ours.

05:59.016 --> 06:01.514
Rosemary, she saved my life.

06:02.251 --> 06:05.405
She threw herself in front
of that bullet.

06:06.163 --> 06:09.030
She was with you when you were
under house arrest, Mrs. Khan?

06:09.030 --> 06:12.191
Yes. And call me Bela, please.

06:12.191 --> 06:15.375
Rosemary came from New York
to stay with me.

06:16.565 --> 06:21.238
She was devoted to me,
to our people.

06:21.915 --> 06:24.341
Who whose bright idea was it
to go through the kitchen?

06:24.341 --> 06:26.173
Our bodyguard, Gil.

06:26.662 --> 06:29.114
- You trust him?
- Implicitly.

06:29.114 --> 06:32.614
He's worked here for our family
for many years.

06:33.416 --> 06:36.411
- Oh, my God. My God, Bella.
- Ajay.

06:36.411 --> 06:38.266
What's happened?
Are you all right?

06:38.266 --> 06:39.276
- I'm fine.
- Look at you.

06:39.276 --> 06:41.941
- Are you wounded?
- Rosemary, she saved my life.

06:41.941 --> 06:43.735
I'm so sorry I wasn't here.

06:43.735 --> 06:45.858
Bela could have used your support.

06:45.858 --> 06:48.381
I came straight from the airport
as soon as I heard.

06:48.381 --> 06:50.106
Yeah. Better late than never.

06:50.106 --> 06:51.569
Rani, please.

07:32.041 --> 07:35.766
Bela Khan, a beacon of hope
in a dark corner of the world.

07:35.766 --> 07:39.000
Translation, she has a long
list of enemies.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.480
Sri Lanka hardliners, Tamil terrorists,
pro-government militia.

07:43.480 --> 07:46.657
Well, why don't we start
with what we've got, the dead shooter?

07:46.657 --> 07:48.625
Little tough until we ID the guy.

07:48.625 --> 07:51.099
He doesn't have record.
Homeland Security doesn't know him.

07:51.099 --> 07:52.648
We're running him through
other databases.

07:52.648 --> 07:54.635
Great, and his gun?

07:54.635 --> 07:57.807
Uh, it's black market.
Serial numbers are filed off.

07:57.807 --> 08:00.356
Unknown gun, unknown gunman

08:00.356 --> 08:03.266
who somehow knew which way
Bela was leaving the rally.

08:03.266 --> 08:06.880
You know it was the bodyguard's idea
to go through the kitchen.

08:06.880 --> 08:09.963
Of course, the family
trusts him implicitly.

08:14.886 --> 08:16.844
As I told you,

08:16.844 --> 08:20.056
we went through the kitchen
because the car was in the back.

08:20.056 --> 08:22.234
This man jumped out of nowhere.

08:22.234 --> 08:24.849
- You ever see him before?
- No.

08:24.849 --> 08:27.148
He aimed at Madame.
I drew my gun,

08:27.148 --> 08:31.438
but before I could shoot,
he killed poor Rosemary.

08:32.299 --> 08:35.135
He fired twice.
Then you fire.

08:35.135 --> 08:38.900
Yes. It was very loud.

08:38.900 --> 08:42.645
One shot.
Right between the eyes.

08:43.192 --> 08:47.186
How about that one, Wheeler?
From 10 to 12 feet away?

08:47.186 --> 08:49.053
Where'd you learn to shoot like that?

08:49.053 --> 08:51.342
Indian Army. Special forces.

08:51.342 --> 08:52.786
Well, here's what I'm interested in.

08:52.786 --> 08:54.965
You're an ace marksman.

08:54.965 --> 08:58.523
Ex-military man.
Cool under pressure.

08:58.523 --> 09:01.953
You dropped that assassin
with just one bullet, right?

09:01.953 --> 09:03.299
Yes.

09:03.299 --> 09:07.337
So why was your reaction slower
than the girl who got shot?

09:13.350 --> 09:14.928
Think about that.

09:19.902 --> 09:21.123
Bodyguard; what do you think?

09:21.123 --> 09:23.349
Well, he's either embarrassed
about how he screwed up,

09:23.349 --> 09:25.084
or he's hiding something.

09:25.415 --> 09:28.317
So hold on to him.
Let him sweat.

09:28.761 --> 09:31.523
The beauty of a material witness.

09:31.523 --> 09:33.100
We ID'd our assassin.

09:33.100 --> 09:35.487
Married, two kids.
Jackson Heights.

09:35.487 --> 09:36.673
Does he have a record?

09:36.673 --> 09:40.618
With the taxi and limousine commission.
He was a cabbie.

09:43.386 --> 09:46.625
They came from the same village.

09:46.625 --> 09:48.773
Your husband and Mrs. Khan?

09:48.773 --> 09:53.520
The Khans cheated his family
out of their ancestral property.

09:53.926 --> 09:58.822
And then he couldn't become an officer
because he came from her village.

09:58.822 --> 10:02.091
"Untrustworthy," they said.

10:04.196 --> 10:06.031
That would piss...

10:07.101 --> 10:10.292
- That would upset me.
- Nothing to be done.

10:10.784 --> 10:14.711
The Khans, they are too powerful.

10:16.204 --> 10:18.291
Too powerful.

10:20.346 --> 10:22.521
Did your husband know this man?

10:24.068 --> 10:25.939
- No.
- You sure?

10:25.939 --> 10:28.813
I have never seen him before.

10:28.813 --> 10:32.718
Was your husband acting
differently lately?

10:33.028 --> 10:36.740
I mean by that, was he making a lot
of phone calls, was he talking to strangers,

10:36.740 --> 10:40.166
did he talk about Mrs. Khan's
return to New York, anything like that?

10:40.166 --> 10:43.335
He was the same
as he's always been.

10:43.335 --> 10:48.760
He drove 12 hours a day,
seven days a week.

10:48.760 --> 10:51.263
He came home to his family.

10:56.324 --> 10:58.795
I don't know why he did this.

11:00.885 --> 11:02.576
I don't.

11:03.469 --> 11:06.704
I've never met him.
We knew the family from our village.

11:06.704 --> 11:08.440
There was bad blood between you?

11:08.440 --> 11:11.642
Some land disputes, litigation,
nothing unusual.

11:11.642 --> 11:13.294
And that's why my Rosemary died,

11:13.294 --> 11:15.960
over a 50-year-old property disagreement.

11:15.960 --> 11:17.839
Does this mean you can release Gil?

11:17.839 --> 11:20.575
You say you knew
your bodyguard a long time?

11:20.575 --> 11:23.087
He and his family
are completely loyal to us.

11:23.087 --> 11:26.597
His brother's under a death sentence
for supporting our cause.

11:26.597 --> 11:30.261
I trust Gil with my life.
There's no way he was involved.

11:30.261 --> 11:32.937
That may be true, but we don't think
the shooter acted alone.

11:32.937 --> 11:36.432
And we've heard you're uncomfortable
with the security detail.

11:36.432 --> 11:39.193
I've had enough protection
these last two years.

11:39.193 --> 11:40.602
Believe me.

11:40.602 --> 11:41.655
I'm sure you have.

11:41.655 --> 11:45.388
Mrs. Khan, we're going to ask you
to cancel all your public appearances

11:45.388 --> 11:47.673
until we can sort all this out.

11:50.437 --> 11:53.248
Do you believe in destiny,
Detective Logan?

11:54.602 --> 11:56.633
I believe you make your own destiny.

11:57.961 --> 12:00.659
My fate is already written.

12:34.516 --> 12:36.612
Welcome back to Canada.

12:39.196 --> 12:41.389
Thank you.
It's good to be home.

12:44.729 --> 12:47.316
The Khans are convinced
the assassin acted on his own.

12:47.316 --> 12:50.186
They don't want to believe
their loyal bodyguard could turn on them.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.882
Well, Gil was more than a hired gun.

12:51.882 --> 12:54.084
His whole family's on the Khan payroll.

12:54.084 --> 12:58.041
Except for a brother who was
sentenced to death for treason.

12:59.389 --> 13:03.644
Gil's brother,
he was under a death sentence.

13:03.644 --> 13:07.034
A judge in Sri Lanka ordered
his release three weeks ago.

13:08.212 --> 13:09.540
Go get him.

13:11.137 --> 13:14.936
Mr. Gil, what did you agree to in
exchange for your brother's freedom?

13:14.936 --> 13:18.113
After the rally, steer Mrs. Khan
through the kitchen...

13:19.046 --> 13:20.809
Let the shooter get off
a shot or two...

13:20.809 --> 13:23.246
And then take him down.
Was that the deal?

13:31.562 --> 13:34.887
I was told no harm would come to her.

13:34.887 --> 13:38.179
It was to scare Madame off.
Make her stop her political work.

13:38.179 --> 13:39.814
If Rosemary hadn't gotten in the way...

13:39.814 --> 13:42.258
I know, Madame would be dead.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.621
Who was your contact?

13:59.157 --> 14:02.107
He called himself Hari.
No last name.

14:02.962 --> 14:05.957
Well, uh, that's not
giving us very much.

14:07.179 --> 14:12.316
His cover was working
for the consulate here, in New York.

14:12.316 --> 14:16.342
I followed him after a meeting.
He got into a car with diplomatic plates.

14:16.342 --> 14:19.158
We'll make an inquiry at the consulate.

14:19.158 --> 14:21.614
He'll be long gone by now.

14:22.843 --> 14:25.264
They won't stop.

14:25.264 --> 14:27.854
They will try again.

14:46.663 --> 14:48.039
Welcome to New York City, sir.

14:48.039 --> 14:49.867
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:15.819 --> 15:17.699
Hari Jindal.

15:17.699 --> 15:20.503
He looks like a paper pusher,
not a double agent.

15:20.503 --> 15:22.546
Probably makes his job easier.

15:22.879 --> 15:25.626
This photograph of Jindal
was taken at Heathrow.

15:25.626 --> 15:28.157
The day of the attempt
on Mrs. Khan's life.

15:28.157 --> 15:30.937
The FBI has Jindal under surveillance?

15:30.937 --> 15:34.257
Not him, the other guy.

15:35.294 --> 15:38.205
Nik "The Mechanic" Loren.

15:38.205 --> 15:39.521
Mechanic?

15:39.521 --> 15:41.475
So he Nicks you and you die, huh?

15:41.475 --> 15:43.828
Corsican born,
now a Canadian citizen.

15:43.828 --> 15:45.838
Person of interest
in a dozen contract killings

15:45.838 --> 15:49.425
in the UK, Europe, North America.

15:49.425 --> 15:52.746
After their meeting at Heathrow,
Nik boarded a flight for Toronto,

15:52.746 --> 15:55.368
- using his own passport.
- And then?

15:55.368 --> 15:57.262
We think he came across
the border by car.

15:57.262 --> 16:00.027
We know he took a flight
from Michigan to New York city.

16:00.027 --> 16:02.129
He wasn't on the watch list?

16:02.129 --> 16:05.523
He was... but...

16:08.912 --> 16:10.706
You lost him?

16:11.512 --> 16:13.092
We'll find him.

16:24.258 --> 16:26.383
I was born into wealth,

16:26.383 --> 16:30.466
with plenty to eat, the best schools,

16:30.466 --> 16:35.446
with my family's great privilege
comes great responsibility.

16:35.926 --> 16:40.672
The responsibility to bring our homeland
into the modern world.

16:40.672 --> 16:44.406
To ensure our children have drinking water,

16:44.406 --> 16:49.236
access to education,
the opportunity for a better life.

16:49.236 --> 16:54.639
This evening is about raising awareness
and much need funds.

16:56.081 --> 16:57.441
Hari Jindal?

16:57.963 --> 17:00.263
The consulate told you
they didn't know him?

17:00.263 --> 17:03.915
- Did you?
- Not really. Rani does.

17:03.915 --> 17:08.680
Jindal was the security liaison when
Rani negotiated Bela's recent release.

17:08.680 --> 17:10.780
- Thank you.
- He did a little more than that.

17:10.780 --> 17:14.617
We believe that Jindal orchestrated
the attempt on your wife's life.

17:15.667 --> 17:18.387
So is he working with government
hardliners, or rogue elements?

17:18.387 --> 17:19.492
We don't know yet.

17:19.492 --> 17:22.116
But until we do, we're concerned
there will be another attempt.

17:22.116 --> 17:25.126
It would be prudent for your wife
to lower her public profile.

17:25.126 --> 17:26.954
You try telling her that.

17:28.416 --> 17:30.374
The man she's talking to...

17:30.374 --> 17:32.317
President of Hudson University.

17:32.317 --> 17:34.916
Her alma mater just invited her to speak.

17:34.916 --> 17:35.921
She accepted?

17:35.921 --> 17:38.859
She feels anything less
would be a sign of weakness.

17:38.859 --> 17:42.132
A signal to her enemies
that she is afraid.

17:42.396 --> 17:44.555
And Bela's not afraid of anything.

17:57.764 --> 18:01.019
Rosemary was always
the brave one.

18:01.019 --> 18:04.938
When I was placed under house arrest,
she rushed to my side.

18:05.691 --> 18:08.644
When I was in despair,
she gave me hope.

18:10.031 --> 18:13.311
She knew we were traveling
a long and dangerous road.

18:20.494 --> 18:24.807
Rosemary, daughter of Tamil,
you join the Martyrs

18:24.807 --> 18:28.616
whose names will be remembered
when the struggle is over.

18:34.593 --> 18:36.877
Rosemary would not want us
to turn back.

18:36.877 --> 18:39.745
Not now. Not ever.

18:40.473 --> 18:44.348
She grew up in New York,
but her heart, her spirit,

18:44.348 --> 18:46.297
was with the Tamil people.

18:53.612 --> 18:58.714
And the best way to honor her memory
is to keep her dream alive.

19:00.408 --> 19:03.499
To bring our country... our people...

19:03.499 --> 19:06.800
Out of the darkness and into the light.

19:08.662 --> 19:13.370
And we will not rest
until that new day dawns.

19:18.367 --> 19:21.767
We must work for a Tamil Homeland.

19:24.862 --> 19:27.465
But with words and deeds,

19:27.465 --> 19:30.183
not guns or bullets.

19:31.070 --> 19:33.854
Let Rosemary's death be the last one.

19:33.854 --> 19:35.763
Let there be no more bloodshed.

19:38.350 --> 19:40.134
Let there be peace.

19:44.607 --> 19:46.157
- What's your name, sir?
- What are you doing?

19:46.157 --> 19:47.583
Sir, we have to ask you
a few questions.

19:47.583 --> 19:49.016
Start with your name.

19:49.016 --> 19:51.857
Tamim Shah.
Rosemary's uncle.

20:01.579 --> 20:03.800
- Very sorry, sir.
- Sorry.

20:17.237 --> 20:21.219
CSU says the shot came from that roof
across the street.

20:21.219 --> 20:24.111
This your guy?
Bela Khan's bodyguard?

20:26.777 --> 20:28.213
Was.

20:29.114 --> 20:30.887
That's a nice piece of shooting.

20:30.887 --> 20:32.256
Routine bail hearing.

20:32.256 --> 20:34.427
Why were they offloading
these guys on the plaza?

20:34.427 --> 20:36.148
They're doing construction.

20:36.475 --> 20:38.822
And the sniper knew?
Any witnesses?

20:38.822 --> 20:41.491
Passer-by saw a man
on the roof after the shot.

20:41.491 --> 20:44.064
- I'll see if he can make an ID.
- Yeah.

20:44.754 --> 20:46.621
Shooter left the weapon behind.

20:46.621 --> 20:49.282
Custom-made US survivor
sniper rifle.

20:49.282 --> 20:51.562
We'll try and run it for prints,
but don't hold your breath.

20:51.562 --> 20:52.945
I won't.

20:55.022 --> 20:56.766
It was too far away to see his face.

20:56.766 --> 20:58.635
The guy on the roof
was wearing a dark cap,

20:58.635 --> 20:59.935
but was clean-shaven.

20:59.935 --> 21:01.975
Oh, it could still be Nik.
He's just changing his look.

21:01.975 --> 21:04.276
Somebody's tying up loose ends.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.954
Who else would know that
the bodyguard had a court date?

21:09.462 --> 21:11.132
His lawyer.

21:14.147 --> 21:17.199
That's a $500 an hour mouthpiece.

21:18.175 --> 21:21.386
Pretty steep for a bodyguard
from Sri Lanka.

21:23.259 --> 21:26.346
Yes, we paid for Gil's lawyer.
Bela insisted.

21:26.346 --> 21:28.172
Even though he betrayed her?

21:28.172 --> 21:30.220
She felt for him.

21:30.220 --> 21:32.044
His situation with his brother.

21:32.044 --> 21:34.374
- She's very forgiving.
- To a fault.

21:34.374 --> 21:37.401
Wanted to post his bail too.
I put my foot down.

21:37.401 --> 21:39.291
Did you know about the court date?

21:39.927 --> 21:41.983
We were kept informed, yes.

21:41.983 --> 21:44.004
We? Who else knew?

21:44.004 --> 21:46.427
The office staff, my family...

21:48.622 --> 21:52.512
Uh, you're not suggesting
we had anything to do with his death.

21:52.512 --> 21:54.528
You seem like a tight-knit family.

21:54.528 --> 21:57.219
That's you, your sister, and...

21:57.219 --> 21:59.179
My older brother, Davi.

21:59.179 --> 22:00.867
We're late for lunch, papa.

22:02.834 --> 22:04.556
Is everything all right?

22:04.556 --> 22:07.024
You remember my daughter, Jasmina?

22:09.876 --> 22:11.470
Bela's life is in danger.

22:11.470 --> 22:14.376
Let us know when you
have a legitimate lead.

22:14.376 --> 22:17.805
Mr. Khan, somebody tried
to kill your sister.

22:17.805 --> 22:20.397
And then your bodyguard betrayed you.

22:20.397 --> 22:22.541
Revenge never crossed your mind?

22:24.168 --> 22:28.501
My family are pacifists, Detective.
We don't kill people.

22:29.134 --> 22:32.072
And they said you'd become
quite the diplomat while I was gone.

22:32.072 --> 22:34.054
In the loosest sense of the word.

22:34.439 --> 22:36.889
Did you notice lots of pictures
of Rani with his family?

22:36.889 --> 22:39.665
Rani with his daughter, but no wife?

22:40.154 --> 22:42.852
Yeah. And no wedding ring, either.

22:43.342 --> 22:46.729
I wonder what the ex-Mrs. Khan
thinks about family loyalty.

22:47.590 --> 22:50.999
This is Jasmina.
We share custody.

22:51.518 --> 22:54.609
Jasmina spends a lot of time
with her father and his family.

22:54.609 --> 22:56.844
Well, it's hard to compete with the Khans.

22:56.844 --> 22:58.247
And their money.

22:58.851 --> 23:00.349
Something like that.

23:01.637 --> 23:04.384
Nice place.
You been here awhile?

23:04.384 --> 23:06.172
Since the divorce.

23:06.172 --> 23:08.819
- Can I be blunt with you?
- Excuse me?

23:09.854 --> 23:12.000
I think you got screwed.

23:12.954 --> 23:15.782
In fact, I think you got screwed big-time.

23:16.394 --> 23:18.343
You're the ex-Mrs. Rani Khan.

23:18.343 --> 23:21.768
With his money, you should
be living in a palace on Park Avenue.

23:21.768 --> 23:23.716
Well, I was naive to sign the prenup.

23:23.716 --> 23:25.642
But Bela was my friend.

23:26.123 --> 23:27.774
You were at school with her?

23:28.144 --> 23:29.461
She's an amazing woman.

23:29.461 --> 23:35.074
She's idealistic,
compassionate, honorable.

23:35.074 --> 23:38.367
And I thought her brother was the same.

23:38.663 --> 23:40.541
- And he's not?
- No.

23:40.541 --> 23:44.163
Rani's only allegiance
is to the family fortune.

23:44.768 --> 23:49.939
After Davi died, he wanted the Khans out
of the free Tamil business.

23:49.939 --> 23:52.048
Davi was the older brother?

23:52.048 --> 23:54.611
He was killed in a plane crash.

23:57.943 --> 23:59.617
Rani's plane.

24:03.469 --> 24:07.865
Rani's ex-wife thinks he'd commit
murder to get the family fortune?

24:07.865 --> 24:10.133
She's not exactly
an unbiased source.

24:10.133 --> 24:12.375
He's got overhead.
A daughter at Yale.

24:12.375 --> 24:14.246
Homes in New York, London.

24:14.246 --> 24:16.391
Chateau in the south of France.

24:16.391 --> 24:18.967
With family wealth like that,
and not enough to go around?

24:18.967 --> 24:21.436
It's expensive liberating a country.

24:21.900 --> 24:26.329
Especially if your brother-in-law
is looting the coffers on the side.

24:27.096 --> 24:31.261
While she was under house arrest,
Rani sued Ajay, Bela's husband,

24:31.261 --> 24:35.453
accused him of embezzling family funds
for risky investments.

24:35.453 --> 24:38.767
Ajay was part of an international consortium.

24:39.279 --> 24:42.972
A lot of complicated financials
involving Nauru.

24:43.837 --> 24:47.424
Isn't that the Island in the South Pacific
where everyone's rich from selling Guano?

24:47.424 --> 24:50.228
Not in 50 years.
It's a failed state now.

24:50.228 --> 24:52.697
Passports for sale, money laundering...

24:52.697 --> 24:55.492
- Good scam.
- Ajay was lost a bundle on it.

24:55.492 --> 24:59.041
And Rani is tight-fisted
with the family fortune.

24:59.041 --> 25:00.695
Well, not when it comes
to private planes.

25:00.695 --> 25:03.486
Rani's company owns
five Cessna citation tens.

25:03.486 --> 25:05.315
Used to own six.

25:05.755 --> 25:08.217
Until the crash that killed Davi?

25:08.217 --> 25:09.296
Right.

25:10.018 --> 25:11.590
It was a paid mission.

25:12.175 --> 25:14.659
No black box,
the engineer who serviced the plane

25:14.659 --> 25:17.605
disappeared after the crash.
They never found him.

25:18.273 --> 25:22.558
Rani killed his older brother,
and now he's trying to kill his sister.

25:24.012 --> 25:26.599
If Bela dies before her mother does...

25:26.599 --> 25:28.873
Rani gets the whole inheritance.

25:29.926 --> 25:32.555
The rally her first night back,

25:32.555 --> 25:35.097
find out who set up the arrangements.

25:36.923 --> 25:39.485
The meeting hall?
Rani chose it.

25:39.485 --> 25:40.610
And he hired the security?

25:40.610 --> 25:43.073
Yes, he takes care of all
the financial arrangements.

25:43.073 --> 25:45.218
You political activities are expensive.

25:45.218 --> 25:46.716
Any tensions between you?

25:46.716 --> 25:50.277
I'm sure I drive my brother crazy.
But that's what sisters are for.

25:50.277 --> 25:51.717
Please, come in.

25:52.397 --> 25:55.912
What about Rani and your husband, Ajay?

25:55.912 --> 25:57.858
He did accuse your husband
of embezzlement.

25:57.858 --> 26:02.082
Oh, a misunderstanding.
The press loves to create scandal.

26:02.426 --> 26:04.660
I rely on Rani totally.

26:04.660 --> 26:06.647
He and mama are all I have left.

26:06.647 --> 26:09.539
Must have been hard
when your older brother died.

26:10.329 --> 26:12.535
The worst day of my life.

26:13.894 --> 26:16.242
They never found the cause
for the accident?

26:16.242 --> 26:17.776
The plane wreckage was scattered.

26:17.776 --> 26:20.471
What really happened,
we'll never know.

26:21.275 --> 26:23.745
- Were your brothers close?
- Not particularly.

26:23.745 --> 26:27.358
Davi was the pure idealist.
Rani, the businessman.

26:27.358 --> 26:32.171
Didn't he own the plane
that Davi was on?

26:39.354 --> 26:41.815
I won't listen to this.

26:41.815 --> 26:47.005
Mrs. Khan, there's an assassin
who's been hired to kill you.

26:47.005 --> 26:48.856
And you think my brother
was involved?

26:48.856 --> 26:51.875
You don't understand
how sacred our bond is.

26:51.875 --> 26:54.128
And tomorrow, when I speak
at Hudson University...

26:54.128 --> 26:55.450
We asked you to postpone that.

26:55.450 --> 26:58.192
When I speak,

26:58.192 --> 27:02.357
my brother will be by my side,
as he always had been.

28:01.703 --> 28:03.333
Ladies and gentlemen,

28:03.333 --> 28:09.312
please welcome to president
Hudson University Dr. Keneath Jamison.

28:12.072 --> 28:16.337
15 years ago, I had the privilege of teaching

28:16.337 --> 28:21.858
a brilliant, beautiful, determined
young woman from Sri Lanka.

28:22.322 --> 28:24.343
I had barely finished my opening remarks

28:24.343 --> 28:27.382
when her hand shot up
in the air with a question.

28:27.744 --> 28:30.636
Well, through the years, she has never
stopped questioning.

28:30.636 --> 28:34.607
A daughter of privilege,
she chose a harder path.

28:35.493 --> 28:37.633
To work for people.

28:38.835 --> 28:43.768
It is my great honor to introduce
the most courageous woman I know.

28:43.768 --> 28:45.036
Fourth row, second seat.

28:45.036 --> 28:47.279
He's alone now,
came in with a wife and kid.

28:47.279 --> 28:49.254
My former student, my dear friend,

28:49.254 --> 28:53.492
and the future president
of an independent Tamil homeland,

28:53.492 --> 28:55.259
Bela Khan.

29:02.892 --> 29:04.705
Thank you, Dr. Jamison.

29:06.926 --> 29:12.182
Dear friends, just before
I was arrested, I visited my village,

29:12.182 --> 29:14.545
and I met a woman there
who was crying.

29:14.545 --> 29:17.939
She had no clean water
for her two small sons.

29:17.939 --> 29:22.006
I held her hand, and I told her
I would help her.

29:22.006 --> 29:26.846
And I will keep my promise
to ensure our children

29:26.846 --> 29:30.683
have the opportunity for a better life.

29:30.683 --> 29:34.511
My family stand with me in that struggle.

29:41.168 --> 29:44.245
Actually, I owe my freedom to my brother,

29:44.245 --> 29:50.180
who worked tirelessly to obtain my release,
and I thank him now.

30:23.268 --> 30:24.565
Wheelchair!

30:34.982 --> 30:36.595
FBI, freeze.

30:56.230 --> 30:59.501
My brother's death will not be in vain.

30:59.859 --> 31:02.843
We will continue our struggle.
They will not silence us.

31:02.843 --> 31:06.081
Yes. How the hell did this happen?

31:06.570 --> 31:08.260
Everyone was looking for Nik,

31:08.260 --> 31:11.222
which means we missed
the heavy-set guy in the wheelchair.

31:11.222 --> 31:12.396
How'd he get his gun through?

31:12.396 --> 31:13.787
Plastic gun.

31:14.556 --> 31:16.248
Came in with a wife and a kid.

31:16.248 --> 31:19.502
We're collecting cell phones,
camcorder videos, news footage.

31:19.502 --> 31:22.076
- Captain Ross.
- Agent Corbett.

31:25.123 --> 31:27.488
We're very sorry for your loss.

31:30.601 --> 31:32.456
Very sorry.

31:42.463 --> 31:44.165
No lawyer.

31:44.165 --> 31:46.062
He doesn't think he needs one.

31:47.403 --> 31:49.518
Ballistics on the plastic pistol.

31:49.518 --> 31:51.661
Single bullet, short range.

31:52.550 --> 31:55.961
Oh, well then Nik was the clean-up man.

31:56.449 --> 32:01.847
Guy in the wheelchair takes
a shot at Mrs. Khan, Nik shoots him,

32:01.847 --> 32:04.205
drops the gun, walks away.

32:04.205 --> 32:06.013
Anything on the wheelchair guy?

32:06.013 --> 32:08.366
Patsy Moran. Quite a jacket.

32:08.366 --> 32:12.175
B&E, truck heists, just did
a dime upstate for armed robbery.

32:12.175 --> 32:15.468
Another gun for hire.
Who's paying for all this?

32:21.806 --> 32:23.388
Don't know him.

32:23.388 --> 32:25.542
Why would he try
to assassinate Bela Khan?

32:25.542 --> 32:27.536
What were you doing at her speech?

32:27.536 --> 32:29.863
- I'm a fan.
- With a gun?

32:29.863 --> 32:32.235
Well, I heard New York is still dangerous.

32:35.169 --> 32:36.925
You're having fun, aren't you?

32:38.964 --> 32:41.611
Hari Jindal.
Did he hire you?

32:41.611 --> 32:43.576
London, the airport.

32:43.576 --> 32:45.674
This man asked me for directions.

32:46.931 --> 32:48.736
Nice talking to you, Nik.

32:51.479 --> 32:53.825
- It's over.
- I guess we're done here.

32:53.825 --> 32:56.194
Thank you.
I'll take my passport.

32:56.194 --> 32:59.633
Oh, no, you don't get your passport.
You're not going home, Nik.

32:59.633 --> 33:03.673
You're going on a CIA-sponsored tour
to all the hot spots.

33:03.673 --> 33:07.318
Egypt, Morocco, Romania.

33:07.318 --> 33:11.926
These are places where
interrogation is sort of a... Art form.

33:13.257 --> 33:14.507
Maybe I do need a lawyer.

33:14.507 --> 33:16.924
Too late.
Extraordinary rendition.

33:16.924 --> 33:19.621
You're out of the system, Nik.
We never heard of you.

33:39.391 --> 33:41.640
How can I help you?

33:41.640 --> 33:43.675
Hari Jindal.

33:43.675 --> 33:45.680
He's just a matchmaker.

33:46.013 --> 33:48.043
But he hired you
to put the hit on Bela.

33:48.043 --> 33:50.054
Bela? No.

33:50.054 --> 33:51.877
- Nik...
- Wait.

33:56.197 --> 33:58.481
Bela wasn't the target?

33:59.571 --> 34:01.245
Rani was.

34:01.245 --> 34:04.104
Yes. From the beginning.

34:04.595 --> 34:06.636
Both attempts?

34:07.029 --> 34:10.094
Jindal ever tell you
who wanted Rani dead?

34:10.094 --> 34:12.498
I never ask who a client is.

34:13.764 --> 34:15.103
Wait.

34:18.161 --> 34:21.058
The money was wired
into this bank account.

34:21.530 --> 34:23.775
Where did the money come from, Nik?

34:23.775 --> 34:25.889
London, through some bank.

34:26.342 --> 34:28.271
In the South Pacific.

34:33.784 --> 34:35.366
Nauru?

34:35.789 --> 34:37.907
As a matter of fact, yes.

34:43.842 --> 34:46.355
Detectives, can we speak another time?

34:46.355 --> 34:49.495
I'm sorry, but the investigation
has taken a turn.

34:49.943 --> 34:52.686
I'm picking photos for Rani's memorial.

34:52.686 --> 34:54.572
We just need to go
through a few things.

34:54.572 --> 34:59.441
Did you know that
your husband and brother
had a falling out over family finances?

34:59.441 --> 35:00.939
They settled that.

35:00.939 --> 35:02.452
We checked the court transcripts,

35:02.452 --> 35:07.164
and Ajay had to reimburse
your family trust $25 million.

35:07.164 --> 35:09.007
Forgive me, what's this about?

35:09.007 --> 35:12.768
We're beginning to believe that Rani
was the assassin's target, not you.

35:12.768 --> 35:13.979
Rani?

35:13.979 --> 35:17.132
Your husband had interests in Nauru?

35:17.132 --> 35:21.556
He traveled there from time to time,
infrastructure development.

35:21.556 --> 35:24.808
What does this have to do
with my brother's death?

35:24.808 --> 35:26.724
Mrs. Khan, please.

35:29.595 --> 35:33.920
The money for your brother's assassination
was wired through Nauru.

35:34.448 --> 35:37.083
Maybe one of my husband's
business partners.

35:37.083 --> 35:40.929
Well, during the first attempt on your life,
your husband was in London.

35:40.929 --> 35:42.591
There was a problem with his Visa.

35:42.591 --> 35:45.771
No, actually there wasn't.
We checked with the State Department.

35:45.771 --> 35:48.532
His visa was approved weeks ago.

35:50.311 --> 35:52.397
This doesn't make sense.

35:53.094 --> 35:56.329
What can you tell us
about the family trust?

35:57.304 --> 35:59.410
I don't know.

35:59.410 --> 36:01.619
There might be papers
here somewhere.

36:01.619 --> 36:03.680
I can't find them for you.

36:06.016 --> 36:08.053
Ajay and Rani handle all that.

36:08.053 --> 36:10.022
And now that Rani's dead?

36:10.320 --> 36:13.458
This is impossible.
Ajay is the love of my life.

36:13.458 --> 36:18.427
Well, forgive me for saying,
but wasn't that an arranged marriage?

36:18.427 --> 36:21.379
And when our eyes met,
I knew he was the one.

36:22.939 --> 36:24.761
And besides,
Ajay was standing next to me.

36:24.761 --> 36:26.851
He could have been killed.

36:27.807 --> 36:29.585
Bela's in denial.

36:29.918 --> 36:32.284
She's convinced herself
her husband was by her side.

36:32.284 --> 36:33.487
He wasn't?

36:33.871 --> 36:35.402
Not when it counted.

36:36.881 --> 36:42.118
Actually, I owe my freedom to my brother,
who worked tirelessly...

36:42.118 --> 36:43.941
There he goes, right on cue.

36:43.941 --> 36:45.818
Out of the line of fire.

36:46.553 --> 36:48.335
What happens when she sees this?

36:48.335 --> 36:50.365
She'll find a way to rationalize it.

36:52.587 --> 36:54.011
Look at this.

37:35.296 --> 37:38.396
You'll have to wait outside.
Bela's about to do a live satellite feed.

37:38.396 --> 37:42.771
Actually, we're here for you, Mr. Khan.
You may want to call your lawyer.

37:42.771 --> 37:44.129
Why?

37:44.129 --> 37:46.505
The hitman you hired to kill Rani.

37:46.844 --> 37:48.676
He's been talking.

37:48.676 --> 37:50.373
I've never met this man in my life.

37:50.373 --> 37:53.994
Technically, that's correct.
Mr. Hari Jindal is your matchmaker.

37:54.801 --> 37:57.390
Bela, do your interviews.
I'll walk the detectives out.

37:57.390 --> 37:59.894
No, no, no. Let them speak.

37:59.894 --> 38:01.440
We need a moment.

38:02.396 --> 38:03.932
It's about the money.

38:03.932 --> 38:06.860
We went over the family trust
papers your wife gave us.

38:07.252 --> 38:10.711
Ajay, we have nothing to hide.
Do we?

38:10.711 --> 38:12.301
What's going on?

38:13.414 --> 38:15.374
Jasmina, not now, please.

38:15.719 --> 38:17.524
It's about your father.

38:18.131 --> 38:22.117
Ajay needed to kill him
before your grandmother dies.

38:22.117 --> 38:24.420
Otherwise, you would inherit
your father's half.

38:24.420 --> 38:27.080
You're wrong.
I know my husband.

38:27.080 --> 38:28.192
Do you?

38:28.192 --> 38:31.549
You told us Ajay was by your side
when your brother was shot.

38:32.001 --> 38:33.641
Yes, that's right.

38:36.431 --> 38:39.214
Look who made sure
he wasn't in danger.

38:47.990 --> 38:52.577
You took a call.
Right before Rani was killed.

38:52.577 --> 38:54.213
Bela.

38:54.213 --> 38:58.046
Oh, my God.
How could you?

38:58.046 --> 38:59.313
Bela?

38:59.313 --> 39:04.891
You killed my father, for money?

39:04.891 --> 39:06.900
I stood by you.

39:06.900 --> 39:09.994
The allegations and the smears.

39:09.994 --> 39:11.670
I defended you, Ajay.

39:11.670 --> 39:13.918
Bela, Ozi-tal.

39:14.965 --> 39:19.582
Rani said he robbed my accounts blind
when I was under house arrest.

39:19.582 --> 39:21.365
We were hemorrhaging money.

39:21.365 --> 39:22.684
Bela, enough.

39:22.684 --> 39:25.116
How could you do this to me, Ajay?

39:25.410 --> 39:27.296
To Jasmina?

39:27.751 --> 39:29.808
To our people?

39:30.579 --> 39:33.488
Ajay Khan, you're under arrest for murder.

39:36.716 --> 39:38.783
Ajay, you didn't see this coming?

39:39.355 --> 39:41.437
How long you been married to her?

39:41.798 --> 39:44.221
You didn't think she'd cut you
loose to save her own skin?

39:44.221 --> 39:46.127
How dare you.

39:46.127 --> 39:49.479
My brother is dead.
You said yourself my husband killed him.

39:49.479 --> 39:51.519
You're very, very good.

39:52.454 --> 39:54.887
She doesn't flinch ever,
does she, Wheeler?

39:54.887 --> 39:57.428
Not even when her brother was shot.

39:59.470 --> 40:01.410
We watched the rest of the tape.

40:03.107 --> 40:05.213
You pushing him away from you.

40:09.031 --> 40:11.013
Into the line of fire.

40:12.222 --> 40:15.121
My partner's right you didn't flinch.

40:16.031 --> 40:19.945
You were clam, composed.
No surprise.

40:21.088 --> 40:25.552
Everyone else in that auditorium
is looking for the shooter or cringing.

40:26.727 --> 40:29.907
But she stays right on message.

40:30.329 --> 40:32.648
My husband is guilty.

40:32.648 --> 40:35.129
You were too quick to kneel.

40:36.682 --> 40:39.066
To cradle your brother.

40:39.440 --> 40:41.657
To get his blood on you.

40:42.825 --> 40:45.696
On your pink suit.

40:45.696 --> 40:48.440
My brother was shot.
That's all I cared about.

40:48.440 --> 40:51.354
No, you knew your picture
would be on the cover of every magazine

40:51.354 --> 40:53.761
and newspaper in the world.

40:57.897 --> 40:59.558
The pink suit...

41:00.404 --> 41:02.350
That was her idea.

41:04.295 --> 41:09.435
She said the blood would show better.
That the image would resonate.

41:09.435 --> 41:12.595
The assassin in the wheelchair,
that was her idea too.

41:12.595 --> 41:14.122
She said Americans
would be embarrassed.

41:14.122 --> 41:16.450
Too PC to search a cripple.

41:16.450 --> 41:20.073
- My God, it was you.
- Jasmina, don't listen to him.

41:20.073 --> 41:22.311
He'd say anything now to save himself.

41:22.311 --> 41:24.418
Did your father
ever suspect his sister?

41:24.418 --> 41:25.707
No.

41:26.593 --> 41:28.752
But my grandmother does.

41:29.496 --> 41:32.977
When I told her my father was dead,
she screamed.

41:32.977 --> 41:36.935
She said now Bela had taken
both of her sons.

41:36.935 --> 41:39.053
Jasmina, these are lies.

41:40.035 --> 41:42.568
My... my own niece against me?

41:42.568 --> 41:44.097
Bela Khan, you're under arrest.

41:44.097 --> 41:46.670
All I have fought for.
All I have endured.

41:46.670 --> 41:48.763
This is almost too much to bear.

41:48.763 --> 41:50.980
It's your destiny.

41:50.980 --> 41:52.858
It was already written.

41:53.657 --> 41:56.762
I will survive this as I have survived
all the attacks against me.

41:56.762 --> 41:59.548
This only strengthens my resolve.

41:59.548 --> 42:04.596
I will continue to fight for an independent
Tamil Homeland for the Tamil people.

42:04.596 --> 42:06.175
They will not stop me.

42:07.049 --> 42:08.822
They will never stop me.
