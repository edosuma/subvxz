00:00.166 --> 00:02.794
Whoo!
That is a mom butt right there--

00:02.960 --> 00:03.879
- long and low.
- Whoa.

00:04.045 --> 00:05.505
Daddy likes mom butts.

00:05.671 --> 00:07.215
Have you guys ever looked
at your checks before?

00:07.381 --> 00:08.638
- Direct deposit, dude.
- No. No, I haven't.

00:08.705 --> 00:10.106
It's bizarro, man.

00:10.173 --> 00:12.041
It says I only get, like,
half of my money here.

00:12.109 --> 00:13.342
Seriously?

00:13.410 --> 00:15.891
Who's fica?
Why am I paying him $55?

00:16.056 --> 00:17.313
"Meeda--
meed-a-care"?

00:17.381 --> 00:18.447
I don't even know what that is.

00:18.515 --> 00:19.853
That's not even a real thing.

00:20.019 --> 00:22.814
All right, guys.
They're taxes.

00:22.980 --> 00:25.734
- Ders, what are taxes?
- Yeah.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.823
Uh, society--
it's a big pie, right?

00:27.891 --> 00:29.125
- We got to help cook it?
- Yeah.

00:29.192 --> 00:30.426
Okay.
You guys know brackets...

00:30.494 --> 00:31.761
- Basketball, you know?
- Yeah, no, I know those.

00:31.828 --> 00:33.909
So it's
progressive bracketology.

00:34.075 --> 00:35.243
- You're losing me, bud.
- Yeah.

00:35.409 --> 00:37.079
Taxes...
They pay for roads,

00:37.245 --> 00:39.206
like, fire trucks,
schools, this park.

00:39.372 --> 00:40.503
Really?

00:40.570 --> 00:43.669
So my tax money paid
for this whole park right here?

00:43.835 --> 00:45.170
- Yes. Yeah.
- That's awesome.

00:45.336 --> 00:48.210
So you're saying that we paid
for everything at this park?

00:48.278 --> 00:49.879
- Yeah.
- We paid for the sand?

00:49.946 --> 00:51.013
Mm-hmm.

00:51.081 --> 00:52.248
Well, fine,
then I'm taking some.

00:52.316 --> 00:54.930
So we paid for that slide
and that swing set

00:55.096 --> 00:56.556
and that bench
over there, right?

00:56.722 --> 00:58.354
- I'm an owner?
- Yeah, you're owning.

00:58.422 --> 01:00.686
That's...I like that.
Taxes are cool.

01:00.852 --> 01:04.260
We definitely own that, then...

01:04.328 --> 01:06.024
Right?

01:06.190 --> 01:08.764
Oh, yeah, we do.

01:08.832 --> 01:11.534
Taxes rule!

01:11.601 --> 01:14.908
I forgot my paycheck.
Turn around.

Ooh, I like that.

01:50.401 --> 01:52.343
What about "Ivan drago-n,"

01:52.410 --> 01:53.947
like the guy who had
the sinister flattop?

01:54.113 --> 01:57.147
"Reptar," right?
From <i>Rugrats.</i>

01:57.215 --> 01:58.816
- That's badass, dude.
- Yeah.

01:58.883 --> 02:01.251
That was such a Tommy move
by me by naming him that.

02:01.319 --> 02:02.456
- It's so Tommy.
- Wait.

02:02.622 --> 02:04.041
Should I get a flattop?

02:04.207 --> 02:06.056
I really feel like you guys
aren't hearing me.

02:06.124 --> 02:07.224
I came up
with the perfect name.

02:07.292 --> 02:09.211
It's "Cee Lo Green."
He has those...

02:09.377 --> 02:11.195
Those short, T-Rex arms,
and, I mean, he's a thug.

02:11.262 --> 02:12.299
He was in goodie mob.

02:12.465 --> 02:13.842
So that's a "no"
on the flattop?

02:14.008 --> 02:15.135
Hey, [Bleep] the dragons!

02:15.301 --> 02:17.095
- What?
- Hey, hey, hey!

02:17.261 --> 02:18.889
Watch your mouth!
This is a family neighborhood!

02:19.055 --> 02:21.099
Yeah!
You, dickhead!

02:21.265 --> 02:22.434
Yeah, you got a problem
with Reptar,

02:22.600 --> 02:24.352
you got a problem with me!

02:24.518 --> 02:26.271
Did you see that poseur
with the skateboard?

02:27.939 --> 02:29.246
Hey, skateboarder dude,
why don't you, uh,

02:29.314 --> 02:31.651
find a real identity?
'Cause you're lying to yourself.

02:31.817 --> 02:33.951
I'm a taxpayer!
What are you?

02:34.019 --> 02:36.990
A sax player in the band,
you idiot?

02:37.156 --> 02:38.283
Oh, get 'em.

02:38.449 --> 02:40.624
Yeah, probably.
That's a cool instrument.

02:40.692 --> 02:41.912
- Nerd!
- Nerd!

02:42.078 --> 02:43.594
Let's, uh...Let's finish
drinking some beers,

02:43.661 --> 02:45.624
because the sweetest revenge
is living well.

02:45.790 --> 02:47.631
Darius rucker said it,
so you know it's real.

02:47.699 --> 02:48.799
- I miss Darius rucker.
- You're right.

02:48.867 --> 02:49.967
- Let's cool our guns.
- Love that song.

02:50.035 --> 02:51.922
- He was in bush, right?
- I think not.

02:52.088 --> 02:53.504
What do you say
we finish these beers

02:53.571 --> 02:55.606
and, uh, celebrate at the bar?

02:55.673 --> 02:57.594
- I like it.
- I like that idea.

02:57.760 --> 02:58.887
Dibs on your hair gel, dude.

02:59.053 --> 03:01.181
Our dragon
is gonna seal the deal,

03:01.347 --> 03:02.390
cee lo green style.

03:02.556 --> 03:04.726
Yeah, definitely.
But his name's Reptar.

03:04.892 --> 03:06.228
But it's actually cee lo green.

03:06.394 --> 03:07.418
Don't make me
swing on you, bro.

03:07.485 --> 03:08.585
- Yeah.
- Oh, you're gonna swing on me?

03:08.653 --> 03:10.187
- All right, all right.
- I'll swing on...

03:10.255 --> 03:11.422
Okay, everyone's a tough guy!

03:11.489 --> 03:13.257
- Everybody's a tough guy!
- Swing on you, bro.

03:13.324 --> 03:14.861
How about I swing
right over the top?

03:15.027 --> 03:16.226
Kiya! Kiya!

03:16.294 --> 03:17.494
Watch it, bro.

03:17.562 --> 03:19.407
I got the meanest uppercut
in freaking cucamonga.

03:24.569 --> 03:26.437
Let it all out, little guy.

03:26.504 --> 03:29.073
Oh, nice!
Good distance.

03:29.140 --> 03:31.545
Good work, bud.
Proud of you.

03:35.297 --> 03:37.384
Ders!
Ders, wake up! Wake up!

03:37.550 --> 03:38.677
What's up?
We going to the bar?

03:38.843 --> 03:40.634
- They're robbing us!
- Oh, my God. What?

03:40.702 --> 03:42.102
No! Cee lo!

03:42.170 --> 03:43.598
I got to get a photo.
I'm gonna get the plates.

03:43.764 --> 03:45.439
- Coming for you!
- What are you doing?

03:45.507 --> 03:46.540
- Ders!
- Wait. What are you doing?

03:46.608 --> 03:47.602
- Ders, grab!
- What are you doing?

03:47.768 --> 03:49.354
Help! Grab me.
Don't let go!

03:49.520 --> 03:50.730
- What are you doing?
- Don't let go!

03:50.896 --> 03:54.234
I got you.
I got you. I got you.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.549
You all right?

03:55.617 --> 03:57.151
Reptar!

03:57.218 --> 03:58.947
- I got a picture.
- Did you take it for me?

03:59.113 --> 04:00.991
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Reptar!

04:01.157 --> 04:02.356
Oh, damn it.
The camera was the wrong way.

04:02.423 --> 04:03.285
- Reptar!
- Oh, my gosh.

04:03.451 --> 04:04.911
You look just like that guy

04:05.077 --> 04:06.460
who was raping his kids
in the basement in Austria.

04:06.528 --> 04:07.706
I know. I know.
It's the eyebrows.

04:08.997 --> 04:10.584
Camera was backwards.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.166
Okay, so what do we got?

04:12.233 --> 04:15.602
Three suspects...
One I'm almost pretty sure

04:15.670 --> 04:17.036
was wearing
a letterman's jacket.

04:17.105 --> 04:18.800
- A letterman's jacket.
- Mm-hmm.

04:18.966 --> 04:20.135
Okay, good.
Car?

04:20.301 --> 04:22.637
- Too drunk to see cars.
- I was still vomiting.

04:22.803 --> 04:25.179
That was pretty impressive.
That was a world record maybe.

04:25.246 --> 04:26.391
Yeah, well, I told you.
Time it.

04:26.557 --> 04:28.560
One stopwatch.
We'll buy that.

04:28.726 --> 04:29.895
Uh, what else?

04:30.061 --> 04:32.439
Oh, I did find this...

04:32.605 --> 04:34.888
A filtered clove cigarette,

04:34.956 --> 04:36.985
which lets me know
there has to be

04:37.151 --> 04:38.737
at least one poseur involved
in this equation.

04:38.903 --> 04:40.530
One clove, one poseur.

04:40.696 --> 04:41.895
Okay, so what are we thinking?

04:41.963 --> 04:43.430
Head down to the school,
bust some skulls,

04:43.498 --> 04:44.576
pull some rip-and-runs?

04:44.742 --> 04:45.832
Eh, you know what?

04:45.900 --> 04:47.467
I think for once,
muscle's not our best play.

04:47.535 --> 04:48.535
- We got to be smart.
- Yep.

04:48.603 --> 04:49.623
We got to be sneaky.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.205
Going undercover.

04:51.272 --> 04:52.806
Check it out.
I brought some disguises.

04:52.874 --> 04:54.544
Whoa!
Cool!

04:54.710 --> 04:55.742
- Good idea.
- No.

04:55.810 --> 04:57.544
I like that.
<i>Underclassman</i> them...

04:57.612 --> 04:58.912
Very smart.

04:58.980 --> 05:01.051
Here's my only concern.

05:01.217 --> 05:03.261
Ders looks old as.
Let's be honest.

05:03.427 --> 05:05.221
Look at that face. It's very old
and wrinkly looking.

05:05.387 --> 05:06.681
No, it's not.
It's smooth.

05:06.847 --> 05:08.255
Uh, but we're
not going undercover.

05:08.323 --> 05:10.057
So why don't we go talk
to the principal

05:10.124 --> 05:12.228
like normal people,
bossmen-to-bossman?

05:12.394 --> 05:14.105
- Principals.
- Yeah.

05:14.271 --> 05:16.733
If we want justice, we have
to take it into our own hands.

05:16.899 --> 05:18.632
Mm-hmm, we got to go,
"where's the statue?"

05:18.700 --> 05:19.967
And they're like,
"oh, don't hit...

05:20.034 --> 05:21.935
You're so much stronger than me.
Don't hit me."

05:22.003 --> 05:24.157
This is blood, and then they
tell us where the statue is.

05:24.323 --> 05:25.739
- That's the rip-and-runs.
- Oh, okay.

05:25.807 --> 05:27.452
- But also undercover, though.
- Yeah.

05:27.618 --> 05:29.037
I'm not gonna drive
unless we do it my way.

05:29.203 --> 05:30.622
- Well, then we walk.
- Then I'm out.

05:30.788 --> 05:31.790
Then we go
to the principal's office.

05:31.956 --> 05:33.313
Great.

05:33.381 --> 05:36.002
This school has, like,
a real-deal football squad.

05:36.168 --> 05:38.385
This guy, their quarterback,
quaid Franklin...

05:38.453 --> 05:40.924
He's just awesome.
He's, like, so cool.

05:41.090 --> 05:42.676
Hey, uh, hi.

05:42.842 --> 05:44.052
Uh, we need to see
the principal, pronto.

05:44.218 --> 05:45.470
It's an emergency.

05:45.636 --> 05:46.763
Do you have an appointment?

05:46.929 --> 05:48.595
Just tell him Adam demamp
from telamericorp

05:48.663 --> 05:50.016
is here to see him.

05:50.182 --> 05:51.765
I'm sorry. If you don't have
an appointment,

05:51.833 --> 05:54.167
- you have to leave.
- Wow. Really?

05:54.235 --> 05:57.315
That's weird,
because as a taxpayer,

05:57.481 --> 05:59.539
I'm almost positive
that I pay your salary.

05:59.607 --> 06:01.775
Right, Ders?
Yeah, absolutely right.

06:01.843 --> 06:04.077
So you kind of work
for us, lady.

06:04.145 --> 06:05.281
Chop, chop.

06:05.447 --> 06:07.648
Look, three of your students
stole a statue

06:07.715 --> 06:10.370
that we as taxpayers legally
stole from a public park.

06:10.536 --> 06:11.418
- Taxpayers.
- Mm-hmm.

06:11.486 --> 06:12.886
So what do you guys do?

06:12.954 --> 06:14.655
Do you coordinate with the fuzz?
Do you work alone?

06:14.722 --> 06:16.590
Rip-and-runs,
bust some skulls?

06:16.658 --> 06:18.825
- I'm happy to rip-and-run.
- I have your information.

06:18.893 --> 06:20.380
There's the door.
Use it.

06:20.546 --> 06:21.762
Oh, "use it"?
Okay.

06:21.829 --> 06:24.467
Well, we might as well, since,
as taxpayers, we own that door.

06:24.633 --> 06:25.432
- We own that door.
- We own that door.

06:25.500 --> 06:26.700
- Okay?
- Yeah.

06:26.768 --> 06:27.868
You know what?
You're fired!

06:27.935 --> 06:29.102
- You're fired!
- You're done here.

06:29.170 --> 06:30.307
- You're fired!
- You're done!

06:30.473 --> 06:31.766
Hey, let's take this door.

06:31.932 --> 06:33.173
We're taking this door.

06:33.241 --> 06:34.269
- Let's take the door out.
- We're taking this door.

06:34.435 --> 06:35.645
- Get the hinges.
- Let's take the...

06:35.811 --> 06:37.077
- You're fired, lady.
- That's for you.

06:37.145 --> 06:38.481
You're never gonna teach again!

06:42.445 --> 06:43.737
♪ The boys are fresh ♪

06:43.903 --> 06:45.447
Oh!

06:45.515 --> 06:47.449
Jnco's are coming back
hard, dude.

06:47.615 --> 06:49.685
- Look at these.
- They are back.

06:49.752 --> 06:50.853
- Yeah.
- Gorgeous.

06:50.920 --> 06:52.537
You look like Russell brand.

06:52.703 --> 06:55.040
Both you guys look cool.
I want a disguise.

06:55.206 --> 06:57.893
Okay, well,
this is plan "b"...Plan Blake.

06:57.961 --> 06:59.728
We should have done it
right off the bat.

06:59.796 --> 07:00.837
This is what I'm gonna do.

07:01.003 --> 07:02.231
I'm just gonna hang out here,

07:02.298 --> 07:03.732
kind post up,
looking like a poseur.

07:03.800 --> 07:05.884
Dig around for dirt
with my mind shovel.

07:06.050 --> 07:07.135
Ah, good call.

07:07.203 --> 07:08.537
I'm gonna go find
the football players,

07:08.605 --> 07:10.405
since they're, like, the popular
and attractive crowd.

07:10.473 --> 07:12.891
I'll slide right in undetected,
just like I did in high school.

07:13.057 --> 07:14.768
Wait, you hung out
with the jocks in high school?

07:14.934 --> 07:16.436
- Yes.
- Okay.

07:16.602 --> 07:17.579
What about you, Ders?

07:17.647 --> 07:19.414
Can't run around
looking like that.

07:19.482 --> 07:21.399
You're gonna get hired
as a science teacher.

07:21.565 --> 07:23.952
You're a funny guy.
I wouldn't worry about me, okay?

07:24.020 --> 07:25.554
Last night
I watched <i>coach Carter,</i>

07:25.622 --> 07:27.089
picked up a few pointers.

07:27.156 --> 07:28.390
I think I'll be fine.

07:28.458 --> 07:30.859
In fact, I'm gonna go
straight to the source,

07:30.927 --> 07:33.036
where the bebe kids be at.

07:36.232 --> 07:37.866
Dang!

07:37.934 --> 07:39.584
What's up with all these books?

07:39.750 --> 07:41.703
Hang on, son.
You here for detention?

07:41.771 --> 07:43.639
Nah, man, I'm here for
the Booty-scratching contest.

07:43.706 --> 07:44.798
Come on, man.
Keep up, keep up.

07:44.964 --> 07:48.510
Not playing today.
Jokes all day.

07:48.676 --> 07:50.979
Damn. Where'd you learn
how to draw like that?

07:51.047 --> 07:52.414
Will you do my name next?

07:52.482 --> 07:54.082
It's Shawn-Ders.

07:54.150 --> 07:55.225
And yours is?

07:57.000 --> 08:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:05.695 --> 08:08.113
What's up, dudes?
Want a clove?

08:08.279 --> 08:09.656
No, we're good, man.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.867
You know what I like to do?

08:11.935 --> 08:13.902
Get together with some
of my close dude friends,

08:13.970 --> 08:16.071
share a clove, steal statues.

08:16.139 --> 08:19.141
You guys ever do anything
exactly like that ever?

08:19.208 --> 08:20.458
Can't say that we have.

08:20.624 --> 08:22.752
Nice mustache, by the way.

08:24.881 --> 08:27.340
Thank you.

08:29.819 --> 08:33.847
What's up, big dog?
Want a clove?

08:34.013 --> 08:34.806
Here, try.

08:36.974 --> 08:38.794
Oh, I get it.

08:38.861 --> 08:41.797
Coach probably doesn't like
you smoking, huh?

08:41.864 --> 08:43.565
But you don't care, do you?

08:43.633 --> 08:45.733
'Cause you're a bad dude.

08:45.899 --> 08:49.404
You like getting into trouble,
stealing stuff...

08:49.472 --> 08:51.139
Maybe a statue?

08:51.207 --> 08:52.532
Talk to me, big man.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.951
Yo, get the hell away from me,
you poseur.

09:01.484 --> 09:02.750
No doubt.
No doubt. Definitely.

09:02.916 --> 09:05.295
What up, dogs?
Yeah, man.

09:05.461 --> 09:07.222
What's up?
I'm Adam demamp.

09:07.290 --> 09:08.657
I just transferred
from the other school

09:08.725 --> 09:10.175
that's pretty far away
from here.

09:10.341 --> 09:12.627
Um...
Little bit about me.

09:12.695 --> 09:14.930
I train with kettle bells
and my favorite movies

09:14.998 --> 09:16.098
are <i>notorious</i> and <i>blow,</i>

09:16.165 --> 09:17.766
so I'm, like, a...
Just real.

09:17.834 --> 09:19.350
I'm so...A real dude
like you guys.

09:19.516 --> 09:21.603
Hey, what's up, dudes, babe?

09:21.769 --> 09:23.897
Whoa.
You're quaid Franklin.

09:24.063 --> 09:25.190
You're so good
at football, dude.

09:25.356 --> 09:27.642
I read this whole paper
about you.

09:27.710 --> 09:30.320
14 touchdowns, 2,238 yards.

09:30.486 --> 09:32.214
He's going to Nebraska
next year.

09:32.281 --> 09:33.990
It's...You're the man, dude.

09:34.156 --> 09:35.033
Yeah, who are you?

09:36.452 --> 09:38.920
I'm...I'm Adam demamp.

09:38.988 --> 09:41.790
I just introduced myself,
but...

09:41.858 --> 09:44.042
They used to call me
meat Mountain in high school.

09:44.208 --> 09:46.261
Yo, dudes.

09:46.329 --> 09:48.171
There's this nerd in
the bathroom that's trying to,

09:48.337 --> 09:50.757
like...I don't know...
Dudes or something.

09:50.923 --> 09:53.593
That's one thing
that I hate--nerds!

09:53.759 --> 09:54.969
Right?
Ugh!

09:55.135 --> 09:57.139
Let's go pound this nerd!

09:57.206 --> 09:58.974
Quaid, let's go pound
this nerd...

09:59.042 --> 09:59.974
Me and you, bro!

10:00.140 --> 10:02.277
Bash bros!
Bash bros!

10:02.345 --> 10:04.346
Let's go, quaid and Adam!

10:04.414 --> 10:06.048
Let's go, wolves.

10:06.115 --> 10:07.357
Let's go!

10:07.523 --> 10:10.852
Hey, man, how come you're here?

10:10.920 --> 10:12.888
Me?
I was stealing, man.

10:12.955 --> 10:14.856
Got caught up stealing statues.

10:14.924 --> 10:16.758
You ever steal statues, man?

10:16.826 --> 10:18.860
You ever steal, like, a, uh...

10:18.928 --> 10:19.995
A dragon statue?

10:20.063 --> 10:21.329
- Excuse me.
- Huh?

10:21.397 --> 10:22.789
Please be quiet.
Thank you.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.143
Man, I didn't even do anything.

10:24.268 --> 10:25.367
Dang!
Okay?

10:25.435 --> 10:26.543
That's it.
You know, Shawn-Ders...

10:26.709 --> 10:27.670
- What?
- That's it.

10:27.737 --> 10:28.771
- We're going to the office.
- Okay.

10:28.838 --> 10:29.938
Give me your I.D.
Let's see it.

10:30.006 --> 10:31.473
You know anything
about a stolen statue?

10:31.541 --> 10:33.108
- We're going to the office.
- Man, stop. Get off me, dude!

10:33.176 --> 10:34.543
How about we give
your parents a call?

10:34.611 --> 10:36.412
What? Okay, wait, wait.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

10:36.479 --> 10:37.513
I'm not Shawn-Ders, okay?

10:37.580 --> 10:39.448
Let's go, wolves!

10:39.516 --> 10:41.150
Let's go--
oh!

10:41.217 --> 10:42.518
Wrong guy.
That's...

10:42.585 --> 10:44.086
We should go check
another bathroom.

10:44.154 --> 10:45.721
No, no, no.
That's him.

10:45.789 --> 10:48.290
And it's time to whup his ass.

10:48.358 --> 10:49.358
No!

10:49.426 --> 10:51.060
Or hear me out.

10:51.127 --> 10:55.297
We could really punish
this perv...

10:55.365 --> 10:58.667
Aaaand...

10:58.735 --> 11:02.037
Give him a swirly.

11:02.105 --> 11:03.572
- All right.
- Yeah!

11:03.640 --> 11:06.775
I just washed my hair.

11:06.843 --> 11:08.410
Come on.
Hold on.

11:08.478 --> 11:12.672
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

11:16.286 --> 11:17.519
Everybody out now!

11:24.127 --> 11:26.528
Good thing I had this chain.

11:26.596 --> 11:30.733
Might have lost my wallet.

11:30.800 --> 11:32.233
Go, wolves.

11:39.189 --> 11:41.857
Gentlemen, this is
a high school.

11:41.924 --> 11:43.620
I could have you thrown
in jail.

11:43.786 --> 11:46.094
Yeah, a jail we pay for
with our taxpayer money.

11:46.162 --> 11:48.124
- Right, Ders?
- Correct-o-mundo.

11:48.290 --> 11:49.798
No, that's not cor...

11:49.866 --> 11:53.546
Good God, you smell.

11:53.712 --> 11:56.841
So, what, some of my students
stole a dragon from you?

11:57.007 --> 11:58.607
Cee lo green.

11:58.674 --> 12:00.386
She was classy and beautiful.

12:00.552 --> 12:01.429
His name's "Reptar."

12:01.595 --> 12:02.944
Well, I imagine they did this

12:03.012 --> 12:04.724
because we're playing
the dragons this weekend...

12:04.890 --> 12:06.726
Our big rival.

12:06.892 --> 12:08.984
You didn't think to notify
surrounding community members

12:09.051 --> 12:10.605
with dragon statues?

12:10.771 --> 12:12.521
That makes sense to me.

12:12.588 --> 12:14.859
Here's what I'm gonna do.

12:17.026 --> 12:18.863
Good afternoon, rc South.

12:19.029 --> 12:21.574
It has come to my attention
that some students

12:21.740 --> 12:23.765
have stolen property
from our residential neighbors...

12:23.833 --> 12:26.468
A dragon statue.

12:28.247 --> 12:30.806
Now, if the statue is not
returned within a week,

12:30.873 --> 12:32.585
the pep rally will be canceled.

12:32.751 --> 12:34.337
So, if you want to have
a pep rally,

12:34.503 --> 12:36.812
please return the statue to...

12:36.879 --> 12:38.049
What's your damn address?

12:38.215 --> 12:41.386
1456 halmin drive.

12:42.852 --> 12:45.720
1456 halmin drive.

12:45.788 --> 12:46.955
Hey, let's show the community

12:47.023 --> 12:48.757
what the wolves
are really made of.

12:48.825 --> 12:50.561
Good day.

12:54.764 --> 12:55.942
Nope.

12:56.108 --> 12:57.777
- God!
- There we go.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.362
Dude, are you smoking
those for real now?

12:59.528 --> 13:01.114
Yeah, they calm my nerves.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.450
I mean, I saw my life flush
before my eyes today.

13:04.616 --> 13:06.374
Okay, just keep
the smoke out the door, man.

13:06.442 --> 13:07.876
Yeah, lose the scarf, too.

13:07.944 --> 13:09.914
You look like you're in
30 seconds to Mars.

13:11.957 --> 13:13.215

13:13.282 --> 13:14.168

If everybody jumped off
a bridge,

would you do that, too?

14:23.654 --> 14:24.655
Huh?

you bitch?

14:33.789 --> 14:35.597
I don't know about any dragon.

14:35.665 --> 14:38.700
I was only trying to fit in.

14:38.768 --> 14:41.255
I'm just the fat kid.

14:41.421 --> 14:43.004
They dared me to poop!

14:43.072 --> 14:44.806
You got to believe me!

14:52.265 --> 14:54.416
Swing on you so bad.

14:54.483 --> 14:55.884
All right, all right,
all right.

14:57.486 --> 14:59.621
Come on, dry off.

14:59.689 --> 15:01.122
Sorry about those dudes.

15:01.190 --> 15:03.569
It's just, uh,
they love that dragon.

15:03.735 --> 15:06.795
I love it.
It's crazy.

15:06.862 --> 15:08.616
You ever had anything
stolen from you?

15:08.782 --> 15:11.800
I lost a bike once.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.913
I went in for a snapple,
I came out,

15:14.079 --> 15:15.103
and it was gone.

15:15.171 --> 15:16.874
Yeah, I'll bet.
What kind of snapple?

15:17.040 --> 15:18.000
I don't remember.

15:18.166 --> 15:20.208
Me neither.
See?

15:20.276 --> 15:22.744
We're not so different,
you and me.

15:22.812 --> 15:25.914
So why don't you just
go ahead and tell me

15:25.982 --> 15:28.817
where my dragon is?

15:28.884 --> 15:31.319
All right.

15:31.387 --> 15:34.155
A couple of the guys
are taking it to a party

15:34.223 --> 15:36.157
to chop it up.

15:36.225 --> 15:37.478
Okay, where's the party?

15:37.644 --> 15:39.627
You know the panda express
on Camilla road

15:39.695 --> 15:40.898
right before the freeway?

15:41.064 --> 15:42.497
Yeah, I do.

15:42.565 --> 15:44.099
They're at a weird white house

15:44.166 --> 15:46.634
with a red door
right across from that.

15:46.702 --> 15:48.570
If you hurry,
you'll get there just in time.

15:48.637 --> 15:49.938
Ready to talk now?

15:50.006 --> 15:51.742
