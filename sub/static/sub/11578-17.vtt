00:01.122 --> 00:02.844
In the criminal
justice system...

00:02.915 --> 00:04.409
sexually based offenses

00:04.482 --> 00:06.009
are considered
especially heinous.

00:06.530 --> 00:08.505
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives...

00:08.578 --> 00:10.521
who investigate
these vicious felonies...

00:10.594 --> 00:12.120
are members of an elite squad

00:12.193 --> 00:13.721
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.017 --> 00:15.741
These are their stories.

00:16.962 --> 00:19.547
Lisa, Ira, look a little bit
towards me. Okay?

00:19.617 --> 00:21.624
You know what Lisa, turn
a little bit more towards Ira.

00:21.696 --> 00:23.388
How much longer is this
going to take, Leo?

00:23.456 --> 00:24.863
Just a sec.

00:24.929 --> 00:27.678
I order pink headpieces for the
flower girls, they deliver white.

00:27.744 --> 00:29.631
How could they screw that up?
Try to relax.

00:29.698 --> 00:31.835
They would have looked better
if I'd made them myself.

00:31.905 --> 00:34.970
Okay. Everybody look towards
me and smile. Good.

00:36.128 --> 00:38.996
What the hell?
Help me.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074

00:50.112 --> 00:51.737
How is he?
Unconscious.

00:52.224 --> 00:55.769
Ten people saw the victim and no one
else come out that door. Any I.D.?

00:55.838 --> 00:58.140
Not yet. Who was here first?
Me.

00:58.240 --> 01:00.344
On foot, post around the
corner when I heard the call.

01:00.446 --> 01:01.395
He say anything?

01:01.471 --> 01:04.120
Something about getting it on
upstairs, before he conked out.

01:04.190 --> 01:07.093
They had one just like it last week,
a couple having sex, she whacks him...

01:07.165 --> 01:09.555
Yeah, we're gonna need
the 61 on that.

01:09.821 --> 01:12.723
Name's Thomas Dowd, 21,
address in Queens.

01:14.237 --> 01:17.980
I.D., credit cards still there,
no cash. Where'd you find it?

01:18.046 --> 01:20.763
Upstairs, the real party
was in his room.

01:22.398 --> 01:26.772
Coat, shirt, shoes, pants, underwear,
bed. Didn't waste any time with small talk.

01:26.845 --> 01:27.827
So, they are going at it.

01:27.901 --> 01:30.291
She grabs the ashtray,
whacks him over the head.

01:30.525 --> 01:32.467
He falls out of the bed.

01:33.276 --> 01:36.375
Probably got hit again,
crawls out for his life.

01:36.444 --> 01:39.194
I'd say Mr. Dowd picked
himself up a pro, got rolled.

01:39.357 --> 01:41.364
Find any fluids?
We were just about to look.

01:41.724 --> 01:43.186
Ready, Charlie?
Yeah.

01:43.261 --> 01:44.471
Show time.

01:47.453 --> 01:49.013
Man, it's everywhere.

01:49.083 --> 01:50.993
Don't people have sex
in bed anymore?

01:51.132 --> 01:54.034
Apparently our victim did.
Check the sheets.

01:55.291 --> 01:58.519
The earth moved.
Then he saw stars.

02:47.513 --> 02:49.999
We canvassed the floor. These
folks may have heard something.

02:50.071 --> 02:52.755
Hi, I'm Detective Benson. This
is my partner, Detective Stabler.

02:52.824 --> 02:54.798
Joe and Amanda Woodward
from Altoona, Pennsylvania.

02:54.871 --> 02:56.530
Our friends warned us
to be careful here.

02:56.600 --> 02:57.582
We came out of the elevator...

02:57.655 --> 02:59.663
on our way to our room, when
we heard someone screaming.

02:59.736 --> 03:01.808
Yeah, it sounded like a woman.
What time?

03:02.135 --> 03:05.746
We went to the matinee and then
had dinner, so it had to be 8:30.

03:05.815 --> 03:07.637
You have any idea where
the screams came from?

03:07.702 --> 03:10.124
We couldn't tell from where
we were. We called security.

03:10.230 --> 03:13.165
Yeah, they came right away,
but it stopped.

03:13.398 --> 03:15.853
They said there was...
It was someone's TV set.

03:16.311 --> 03:19.921
You see anybody coming or going?
No. Nobody. The hallway was empty.

03:20.182 --> 03:22.070
This kind of thing happen
a lot around here?

03:22.262 --> 03:25.328
City's never been safer.
Enjoy the rest of your stay.

03:25.494 --> 03:26.671
Okay. Thank you.

03:27.574 --> 03:28.915
The room was in
Mr. Dowd's name.

03:28.982 --> 03:30.804
Were you here when
Mr. Dowd checked in?

03:30.870 --> 03:33.684
He registered
just before 8:00.

03:33.877 --> 03:36.332
Yes, I would have been here.
Was he alone?

03:37.204 --> 03:39.027
I don't personally
check guests in.

03:39.093 --> 03:41.002
You are welcome to ask
the clerk who registered him.

03:41.077 --> 03:42.986
We'll need to talk to all
the clerks who were on duty...

03:43.060 --> 03:44.882
and get copies
of your security tapes.

03:44.949 --> 03:46.923
We'll also need the names
of your guests.

03:47.029 --> 03:48.817
On that floor?
All the guests.

03:48.884 --> 03:50.194
Who's adjacent to Mr. Dowd?

03:53.172 --> 03:55.408
Both rooms were vacant.

03:55.796 --> 03:57.104
It's the off-season.

03:59.252 --> 04:01.902
What's all this?
Asbestos testing.

04:02.036 --> 04:04.785
It's in every building
constructed before 1970.

04:04.852 --> 04:08.332
I am not staying in here with all those
tiny cancer-causing particles flying around.

04:08.403 --> 04:09.864
Stop worrying.
As an African-American...

04:09.938 --> 04:11.881
you're statistically
far more likely to die...

04:11.954 --> 04:13.929
of diabetes, high blood
pressure or heart disease.

04:14.163 --> 04:16.531
Or a bullet.
All right, where are we?

04:17.555 --> 04:19.660
Checking the guest list
and waiting on the DNA.

04:19.730 --> 04:22.283
Turns out that Thomas Dowd
was victim number two.

04:22.355 --> 04:24.526
Victim number one was
a businessman from St. Louis.

04:24.593 --> 04:28.685
Picked up a woman named Samantha
last week at the Midtown Arms.

04:28.818 --> 04:30.607
They go up to his room,
they have sex...

04:30.674 --> 04:33.488
after which she buries a
telephone receiver into his head.

04:33.554 --> 04:36.969
Cash was stolen, wallet and I.D.
left behind. We talk to this guy?

04:37.041 --> 04:39.824
Yeah. He hung up on me. He said
that his wife was in the next room.

04:39.889 --> 04:41.994
So, we got a pro who likes
to get violent.

04:42.097 --> 04:45.130
Maybe. One thing
stood out on the 61.

04:45.233 --> 04:48.168
Here it is."Victim says assailant
wanted him to get rough with her...

04:48.240 --> 04:49.288
"he got nervous.

04:49.360 --> 04:51.695
"He tried to leave."
That's when she crowned him.

04:51.761 --> 04:54.478
So, she's leaving a trail of
bloody men at high-end hotels.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.202
This case has vice
written all over it.

04:56.272 --> 04:59.567
Rule out a bona fide sex crime, I
will hand the file to them myself.

04:59.632 --> 05:00.777
Great. Thank you.

05:01.008 --> 05:03.823
Let's see what Thomas Dowd
says. He woke up an hour ago.

05:07.024 --> 05:09.544
On his way home, gets mugged
and beaten in the streets.

05:09.840 --> 05:11.083
Ma, please.

05:11.152 --> 05:13.606
Right on 5th avenue.
Nobody's safe.

05:13.680 --> 05:16.265
Mrs. Dowd, we just need a
few minutes alone with Tommy.

05:19.759 --> 05:22.344
I'll go get a cup of tea.
Thank you.

05:27.663 --> 05:29.190
You told your Mom
you were mugged.

05:29.709 --> 05:32.645
You think I want her to know I was
in a hotel room with some woman?

05:32.975 --> 05:34.829
Where did you pick up
your date?

05:35.150 --> 05:36.939
In the bar at the Decameron.

05:37.454 --> 05:38.795
My buddy Frank was...

05:39.182 --> 05:41.833
supposed to meet me there for
a few beers and the Knick game.

05:42.477 --> 05:44.811
Why the Decameron?
Frank suggested it.

05:45.229 --> 05:47.563
Doesn't like the smoke
in the sports bars.

05:48.141 --> 05:50.563
Didn't matter. He never
showed. But you stayed?

05:50.957 --> 05:52.648
I didn't want to miss tip-off.

05:55.244 --> 05:58.376
I am sitting there, she comes
over to me. Real nice-looking.

05:58.988 --> 06:00.396
Name?
Jill.

06:00.748 --> 06:01.893
Jill. And...

06:03.053 --> 06:05.257
how much did Jill want?
It wasn't like that.

06:06.380 --> 06:08.747
We start talking.
We hit it off.

06:09.388 --> 06:13.446
She suggests we go upstairs. So I
go to the front desk and register.

06:13.708 --> 06:15.137
And? Then what?

06:15.596 --> 06:17.188
She says she's a little shy.

06:17.419 --> 06:20.288
I should give her the key, wait
five minutes and follow her up.

06:20.523 --> 06:24.069
I get up there, open the door,
she's waiting in bed for me.

06:24.267 --> 06:27.115
Yeah, we saw your trail of clothes.
You two didn't waste much time.

06:27.402 --> 06:29.476
I get in there
and she grabs me.

06:29.867 --> 06:32.769
Pulls me on top of her and we go
at it like there's no tomorrow.

06:35.211 --> 06:39.366
Next thing I know, some guy in a
tuxedo is standing over me in the lobby.

06:40.842 --> 06:42.217
Can you describe Jill?

06:44.169 --> 06:45.119
Blonde...

06:45.674 --> 06:46.622
buff...

06:47.593 --> 06:49.022
looked like
she was in her thirties.

06:49.098 --> 06:52.479
We will have a computer sketch artist
come on down. Did she say anything to you?

06:52.969 --> 06:54.758
She wanted me
to fight her for it.

06:55.689 --> 06:58.373
Said she liked it rough.
So I went along.

07:00.200 --> 07:02.753
Did she at any time
tell you to stop it?

07:02.888 --> 07:05.408
She told me to slap her
harder, make it hurt.

07:06.025 --> 07:07.846
I said that's not my scene,
but...

07:08.584 --> 07:10.372
she wouldn't take no
for an answer.

07:12.744 --> 07:15.613
Maybe Jill has second thoughts
when guys fight too hard.

07:16.072 --> 07:19.487
She picked both men up at hotel bars.
Let's see if the bartenders remember her.

07:20.488 --> 07:22.080
Yeah, he was here.

07:22.920 --> 07:25.701
Nursed the same drink for an
hour and forgot to leave a tip.

07:25.799 --> 07:28.320
Anyone here with him?
Some blonde.

07:28.551 --> 07:30.623
Didn't hang out long, though.
How long?

07:30.983 --> 07:34.495
Five minutes, tops. He hands
her a room key. She leaves.

07:34.663 --> 07:38.012
He heads out a few minutes later.
That's not a lot of get-to-know-you time.

07:38.119 --> 07:42.309
He ever step away from the bar
before that? If he did, I missed it.

07:42.726 --> 07:43.937
What time did they hook up?

07:44.454 --> 07:45.403
8:30.

07:45.798 --> 07:47.489
End of the first quarter
of the Knicks game.

07:48.070 --> 07:51.811
You must know some of the local
businesswomen who hang out here.

07:51.878 --> 07:54.726
She wasn't one of them.
But I've seen him here before.

07:54.789 --> 07:57.472
Alone?
Always with a different woman.

07:58.278 --> 08:00.066
Good looking young guy
like him, I don't get it.

08:00.645 --> 08:01.592
Get what?

08:01.797 --> 08:04.796
Some of his dates are
old enough to be his mother.

08:06.821 --> 08:07.769
Yeah.

08:09.348 --> 08:11.259
What's up, Doc?
I am not taking any chances.

08:11.332 --> 08:12.958
They haven't done
anything yet.

08:13.029 --> 08:15.679
This is out of control.
Where's my desk?

08:15.844 --> 08:18.113
I'm having the desks moved out
into the hallway.

08:18.180 --> 08:20.482
All right, everybody upstairs.
Grab your case files.

08:20.547 --> 08:22.042
Olivia, what've you got?

08:22.948 --> 08:24.289
Tommy Dowd lied to us.

08:24.356 --> 08:26.364
He already had the hotel room
when he met our Jill.

08:26.435 --> 08:29.752
Bartender says Tommy was hanging
with women who had 20 years on him.

08:29.827 --> 08:32.609
So, either he's got an Oedipus
complex or he's the pro.

08:33.058 --> 08:36.288
You should run him through the
computer before you go back to see him.

08:36.962 --> 08:38.490
One arrest, prostitution.

08:40.066 --> 08:41.724
What really happened
last night?

08:42.434 --> 08:43.841
Cut out the games, Tommy...

08:43.905 --> 08:46.776
and start separating out fact
from fiction for us, okay?

08:49.666 --> 08:52.350
Client offered me $1,000
to sleep with her.

08:53.122 --> 08:54.332
How'd she find you?

08:57.025 --> 08:58.880
I work for an escort service.

09:01.857 --> 09:04.093
It's legitimate.
I needed the money.

09:04.193 --> 09:06.495
What for?
For my mother.

09:06.753 --> 09:09.055
Come on. You're gonna have to
do better than that.

09:09.120 --> 09:10.299
It's the truth.

09:10.497 --> 09:12.219
My father died last year.

09:13.088 --> 09:14.364
I go to City University.

09:14.433 --> 09:17.782
I had to drop out to help Mom run our
dry-cleaning store out in Elmhurst.

09:18.624 --> 09:20.217
Dad liked to play the ponies.

09:20.704 --> 09:22.842
We didn't know how much
until after he was gone.

09:22.912 --> 09:24.407
So he left you in debt?

09:24.480 --> 09:27.066
We lost the store,
almost lost the house.

09:27.231 --> 09:30.100
And you moonlight as a pro.
Escort. Walker.

09:30.335 --> 09:31.928
Rent-a-date
for the over-50 set.

09:31.999 --> 09:34.104
Take them out and make sure
they don't fall asleep.

09:34.207 --> 09:36.727
Lot's of guys do it in college.
They need the money, too?

09:36.831 --> 09:39.700
$600 an hour, minimum
three-and-a-half-hour date...

09:39.775 --> 09:41.269
we take home 40%.

09:42.078 --> 09:43.901
You are almost guaranteed
$1,000 a night.

09:43.966 --> 09:46.039
Any of them get arrested
for prostitution?

09:46.335 --> 09:48.222
Client offers me
an extra $500 cash...

09:48.287 --> 09:50.010
to spend the night,
how do I know she's a cop?

09:50.078 --> 09:51.605
Didn't stop you
from doing it again.

09:51.678 --> 09:52.954
Last night?
Yeah.

09:53.278 --> 09:55.417
Jill offered me
an extra $1,000.

09:56.509 --> 09:58.682
Look, none of this changes
what happened to me.

09:58.750 --> 10:01.618
It does if you forced Jill
to have sex.

10:03.070 --> 10:05.175
I did what she wanted.
I didn't rape her.

10:06.141 --> 10:07.668
I don't know what set her off.

10:11.549 --> 10:14.897
Tommy's one of my most requested
escorts. Witty, charming, down-to-earth.

10:15.357 --> 10:17.244
The ladies love him because
he's not just arm candy.

10:17.309 --> 10:20.756
You ever have complaints about him? He
wouldn't be working here if there were.

10:21.436 --> 10:23.607
Do you employ a lot
of college kids like Tommy?

10:23.836 --> 10:24.949
It's a win-win.

10:25.020 --> 10:27.224
I get the handsome, nice
young men my clients want...

10:27.292 --> 10:28.306
And they get 40%?

10:28.605 --> 10:32.347
My clients are among the wealthiest
and most influential women in New York.

10:32.924 --> 10:35.957
Widows or women whose
husbands travel for business...

10:36.029 --> 10:37.337
who don't want
to be seen out alone.

10:37.723 --> 10:41.520
My escorts accompany them to the
theater, opera, museums, parties.

10:41.595 --> 10:43.088
Good deal
for a college student.

10:43.163 --> 10:46.293
They are exposed to culture and
class while providing companionship.

10:46.588 --> 10:49.620
What about sexual favors?
Do your escorts provide that?

10:51.131 --> 10:54.229
I find out about it, I fire
the escort and drop the client.

10:54.778 --> 10:56.469

in my business.

10:56.795 --> 10:58.321
You are not saying Tommy...

10:58.394 --> 11:01.176
We are not implying anything, it's
just part of our investigation.

11:02.617 --> 11:06.446
Here it is. Hotel Decameron,
8:00, wedding escort.

11:08.121 --> 11:11.350
And the client's name?
Jill Lessard. A first-timer.

11:13.049 --> 11:14.326
Okay, thank you.

11:17.081 --> 11:18.029
Yeah, thanks.

11:18.680 --> 11:21.647
That was the hotel. No one named
Lessard on the wedding invitation list.

11:21.721 --> 11:24.142
Perp could've got that off the
list of events at the lobby.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.453
Yeah, I am still here.
What about security tapes?

11:26.584 --> 11:28.407
Midtown Arms recycles
after one week.

11:28.473 --> 11:31.288
The camera on the fifth floor
of the Decameron wasn't working.

11:31.352 --> 11:32.530
Yeah. All right.

11:32.600 --> 11:35.634
Jill Lessard was 1,000 miles
away from here two nights ago.

11:35.801 --> 11:37.361
Where?
Kewanee, Illinois.

11:37.465 --> 11:38.740
Hog capital of the world.

11:38.808 --> 11:40.467
Somebody stole
her credit card number...

11:40.536 --> 11:42.925
then used it to book
the escort at Man About Town.

11:42.999 --> 11:46.894
So our perp's racked up one
identity theft and two assaults.

11:47.031 --> 11:48.307
Make that three.

11:54.198 --> 11:55.147
What have we got?

11:55.287 --> 11:57.196
Unidentified male,
looks mid-twenties...

11:57.271 --> 11:59.889
was wearing a condom
when hotel security found him.

11:59.991 --> 12:02.194
The perp picked the whole
wallet this time. Deja vu.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.237
Right down to the victim.
Another pretty boy.

12:04.310 --> 12:05.259
You find anything else?

12:05.334 --> 12:06.926
Tonight's weapon of choice.

12:08.214 --> 12:10.036
Just had to reach over
to the night stand.

12:10.103 --> 12:12.819
She do as much damage to the
victim? He's in dreamland.

12:12.918 --> 12:15.852
EMS rushed him out of here.
They said it's likely he'll die.

12:16.021 --> 12:18.355
I will bet my vacation we've
got another escort.

12:24.758 --> 12:28.434
We ran his prints. Name is Victor
Coe, 26, address on Riverside Drive.

12:28.660 --> 12:30.034
Three arrests
for prostitution.

12:30.197 --> 12:32.782
We showed a sketch of Jill to
the bartender at the Beaumont.

12:33.077 --> 12:34.702
He I.D.'d her
as Coe's companion.

12:34.772 --> 12:36.299
Bartender also saw
the foreplay.

12:36.373 --> 12:39.373
He passes her the key, then waits
five minutes before he follows her up.

12:39.444 --> 12:40.873
Coe still likely to die?

12:41.076 --> 12:43.410
He's been upgraded to critical,
but he can go either way.

12:43.476 --> 12:46.824
The businessman she picked up from St.
Louis wouldn't play into her fantasies.

12:46.900 --> 12:50.696
So, she buys herself some escorts
thinking the customer is always right.

12:50.771 --> 12:52.016
They will do
whatever she wants.

12:52.084 --> 12:55.018
Perp got Dowd from Man About Town.
Bet she got Coe from there, too.

12:55.123 --> 12:57.457
Pay Leslie Desantis
another visit.

12:57.618 --> 13:00.935
We got a pattern here.
Check with NCIC, VICAP.

13:01.298 --> 13:03.720
Maybe Jill played her fantasy
out in some other city...

13:03.795 --> 13:05.321
before she took her act
on the road.

13:05.938 --> 13:09.102
Coe have any family here? A
brother, a high-powered art dealer.

13:09.169 --> 13:12.039
He owns the apartment on
Riverside Drive where Victor lives.

13:12.114 --> 13:14.186
Persuade him to let you
take a look around.

13:17.617 --> 13:19.046
When did you last see Victor?

13:19.633 --> 13:22.415
It's been months.
We were both too busy.

13:22.898 --> 13:26.475
Now he's in some hospital bed on a bubble.
Nice place. What does your brother do?

13:27.090 --> 13:29.806
He's a starving actor.
How's he afford this?

13:29.904 --> 13:31.017
I enable him.

13:31.760 --> 13:34.149
Victor pays a little rent
when he can.

13:34.257 --> 13:37.224
It's hard to do on his income
off those off-off Broadway plays.

13:37.616 --> 13:39.274
Wish I had a brother like you.

13:46.415 --> 13:50.758
These chairs are Alvar Aalto,
1929. I admire your taste.

13:51.471 --> 13:52.878
I didn't buy any of this.

13:53.616 --> 13:56.779
Victor had all hand-me-down
furniture the last time I was here.

13:56.944 --> 13:59.398
Mr. Coe, were you told
how your brother was attacked?

14:00.302 --> 14:02.091
No. Does it matter?
It might.

14:02.672 --> 14:05.093
Victor was arrested several
times for prostitution.

14:05.710 --> 14:06.660
My God.

14:06.926 --> 14:09.098
We think whoever did this
to him was a client.

14:09.327 --> 14:11.846
And there is a way you can help us. How?

14:11.982 --> 14:13.543
Let us take a look around.

14:13.614 --> 14:17.095
There could be something that lets us
know who Victor met up with last night.

14:18.701 --> 14:20.130
Where do you want to start?

14:20.782 --> 14:23.880
I fired Victor three months ago.
Why are you asking about him?

14:23.949 --> 14:26.088
Because he was beaten
the same way Tommy Dowd was...

14:26.158 --> 14:27.587
only Victor may not make it.

14:28.141 --> 14:30.759
I screen my clients.
Apparently Victor didn't.

14:31.149 --> 14:32.972
Your concern is overwhelming.

14:33.036 --> 14:36.834
I treated him well. He thanked me
by taking money out of my pocket.

14:36.909 --> 14:38.250
Is that why you fired him?

14:39.212 --> 14:42.529
Client complained when Victor
offered her his services...

14:42.605 --> 14:44.230
the whole night
for $1,000 dollars.

14:44.301 --> 14:46.122
I boot him,
he steals my clients.

14:46.413 --> 14:49.129
So, I guess you wouldn't be too
sorry if Victor went out of business.

14:49.196 --> 14:51.651
I would delight in it.
But I wouldn't hurt him.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.481
Any of your rivals
out to hurt you?

14:53.996 --> 14:57.509
This is a competitive business,
Detective. Not cutthroat.

14:58.188 --> 15:02.311
The list from Victor Coe's Palm Pilot is
a who's who of the city's finest ladies.

15:02.411 --> 15:03.425
Anybody stand out?

15:03.531 --> 15:05.832
One whose husband's office
number is also tucked inside.

15:05.900 --> 15:06.979
Claudia Baines Marshall.

15:07.050 --> 15:09.767
Wife of Merchants Commerce
Bank chairman, Darien Marshall.

15:09.867 --> 15:12.104
Isn't he up
for some ambassadorship?

15:12.171 --> 15:14.888
If Coe was servicing the most
prominent women in town...

15:14.955 --> 15:18.119
then Mrs. Marshall's number makes
sense, but Mr. Marshall's doesn't.

15:18.251 --> 15:21.284
Unless Coe attached a price to
Mrs. Marshall's indiscretion.

15:21.450 --> 15:22.398
Blackmail.

15:22.666 --> 15:24.641
Coe's bank statement
from the apartment.

15:24.746 --> 15:28.226
Someone wired $75,000 into his
checking account six months ago.

15:28.298 --> 15:31.843
One day later, Coe cuts Dowd
a check for $5,000.

15:31.914 --> 15:33.637
So Dowd could be
in on this, too.

15:34.153 --> 15:37.318
You two, talk to Mrs. Marshall.
You two, go talk to Mr. Marshall.

15:37.385 --> 15:39.687
And I am sure I don't have
to tell you to tread lightly.

15:39.753 --> 15:43.168
These people probably have their own
dresser drawer in the Lincoln bedroom.

15:45.609 --> 15:47.397
Can I have Inez
bring you something?

15:47.463 --> 15:48.544
No, thank you.

15:48.841 --> 15:52.615
Then how can I help you, detectives?
Victor Coe. Do you know him?

15:53.609 --> 15:55.038
And if I told you I didn't?

15:55.112 --> 15:58.527
Mister Coe was found nearly beaten
to death. Your number in his Palm top.

16:00.391 --> 16:02.693
Is Victor okay?
He's hanging on.

16:03.944 --> 16:05.088
Why come to me?

16:05.416 --> 16:08.165
We need to know the extent of
your relationship with Victor.

16:08.583 --> 16:10.208
Is this necessary?

16:10.279 --> 16:11.261
If word gets out...

16:11.335 --> 16:13.157
It doesn't have to
leave the room.

16:15.398 --> 16:17.057
I've spent 30 years
of my life...

16:17.127 --> 16:20.868
reassuring my husband he was
capable of becoming the man he is.

16:21.575 --> 16:23.549
I gave him children,
reared them...

16:23.622 --> 16:25.990
stood by his side through
things you can't imagine.

16:27.046 --> 16:30.591
All I asked in return was his loyalty.
It was the one thing he wouldn't give me.

16:30.661 --> 16:32.516
Is that why you went
to Victor?

16:32.741 --> 16:34.782
When I found out
my husband was...

16:34.948 --> 16:39.040
reassuring himself with 20-somethings
who stroke him like a rabbit's foot...

16:39.813 --> 16:42.180
I decided I was entitled
to my own diversions.

16:42.276 --> 16:44.733
Wouldn't your husband have
been angry if he'd found out?

16:44.804 --> 16:45.753
No.

16:46.502 --> 16:48.159
Darien knows about Victor.

16:48.869 --> 16:52.830
Our marriage has long since disintegrated
from one of love into one of convenience.

16:53.092 --> 16:55.361
He needs me, and I need him.

16:55.972 --> 16:56.986
How did you meet Victor?

16:57.061 --> 16:58.817
Through the escort service...

16:59.012 --> 17:02.078
after they sent several men
who were not up to par.

17:02.980 --> 17:04.257
Tommy Dowd one of them?

17:05.380 --> 17:06.940
Tommy was a child.

17:07.011 --> 17:10.306
A nice young man,
but not terribly adventurous.

17:11.588 --> 17:14.304
Your husband's office number
is also in Victor's computer.

17:15.236 --> 17:16.958
It is?
Any idea why?

17:18.019 --> 17:19.448
You'll have to ask him.

17:19.810 --> 17:22.178
I have no idea how my number
got into his computer.

17:22.242 --> 17:23.671
Did you meet Mr. Coe?

17:24.547 --> 17:25.953
I haven't had the pleasure.

17:26.819 --> 17:27.768
Talk to my wife.

17:27.875 --> 17:29.816
So, you're aware
of their relationship?

17:30.050 --> 17:31.294
It must upset you.

17:32.386 --> 17:35.964
Recessions upset me. The collapse
of the dot-com economy upsets me.

17:36.514 --> 17:38.237
My wife's dalliances do not.

17:38.305 --> 17:41.152
You're not concerned that public
knowledge of your wife's trysts...

17:41.218 --> 17:43.257
could derail
your diplomatic ambitions?

17:43.682 --> 17:46.048
Claudia wants this
ambassadorship as much as I do.

17:46.369 --> 17:48.922
I have always been able to
count on her to be discreet.

17:49.217 --> 17:51.967
Did you pay Victor Coe so you
could count on his discretion?

17:52.225 --> 17:53.173
Excuse me?

17:53.377 --> 17:55.995
Someone transferred $75,000
into his account.

17:56.065 --> 17:57.439
After we get the subpoena...

17:57.504 --> 18:00.318
it will only be a few hours
before we know where it came from.

18:02.144 --> 18:04.413
Mr. Coe made me an offer
I couldn't refuse.

18:04.480 --> 18:06.389
What's your guarantee
he sticks to it?

18:06.784 --> 18:09.118
A notarized
confidentiality agreement.

18:09.632 --> 18:12.631
He reveals anything in our
transaction or the details therein...

18:12.704 --> 18:13.752
he has to return the money.

18:13.823 --> 18:16.606
But if that happens, the damage
to your reputation's already done.

18:16.671 --> 18:18.743
Maybe you wanted
a more permanent agreement.

18:20.256 --> 18:22.873
Gentlemen, if I wanted
Victor Coe dead...

18:23.743 --> 18:25.783
he'd be in his grave by now.

18:29.406 --> 18:32.025
Everything's a transaction to
that guy, including his marriage.

18:32.094 --> 18:34.877
$75,000 is pocket change.
Marshall spends at least that on...

18:34.942 --> 18:38.171
lobbyists greasing the congressional
wheels for his confirmation hearings.

18:38.238 --> 18:40.093
Is there anything
you're not suspicious about?

18:40.158 --> 18:42.263
No. Including
what's in this hot dog.

18:43.422 --> 18:44.371
Tutuola.

18:46.397 --> 18:47.477
I'm on it, Captain.

18:47.550 --> 18:49.852
We got to pick up Tommy Dowd.
What'd he do now?

18:49.917 --> 18:52.732
Paid off a $43,000 dollar debt
six months ago.

18:52.797 --> 18:56.092
Maybe I should become an
escort. Don't quit your day job.

18:56.477 --> 18:58.549
$26,000 dollars
for your mother's mortgage...

18:58.621 --> 19:00.890
and another $17,000
for your two credit cards.

19:00.957 --> 19:03.444
We have the $5,000 check
Victor Coe wrote you.

19:03.517 --> 19:04.465
What are you talking about?

19:04.540 --> 19:07.257
Wow. That whack on the head
must have given you amnesia.

19:07.676 --> 19:10.524
You and Victor blackmailed
Darien Marshall, didn't you?

19:10.588 --> 19:11.537
Blackmail?

19:11.676 --> 19:14.577
You both slept with Marshall's
wife. I never slept with her.

19:14.716 --> 19:17.464
I escorted her twice. She
asked Leslie to replace me.

19:17.533 --> 19:20.183
So you figured you could make a
quick buck at Marshall's expense?

19:20.252 --> 19:22.587
You thought it up, Victor carried
it out. Is that how it went?

19:22.651 --> 19:24.080
That $5,000?

19:24.539 --> 19:26.644
Victor owed it to me for
bailing him out a few times...

19:26.715 --> 19:28.341
when he couldn't take
an assignment.

19:28.699 --> 19:30.323
Fine. Where'd you get
the rest?

19:31.803 --> 19:33.296
My boss loaned it to me.

19:34.171 --> 19:35.992
Leslie Desantis?
Yeah.

19:36.347 --> 19:37.294
With interest?

19:39.706 --> 19:42.096
I perform personal
services for her. Sex?

19:42.586 --> 19:43.797
I was desperate.

19:43.898 --> 19:47.727
My mother was about to lose the house. I
told Leslie and she offered me the money.

19:48.090 --> 19:49.651
Swore I'd pay back every cent.

19:50.106 --> 19:52.593
She didn't tell me I had to
sleep with her until afterwards.

19:52.666 --> 19:55.512
I did for a while, until
Leslie wanted me all the time.

19:55.737 --> 19:56.850
So, what did you do?

19:57.209 --> 19:58.419
We had a huge fight.

19:58.489 --> 20:01.172
I say I am going to quit she says
she's going to call in my loan.

20:01.305 --> 20:02.734
I had to stay.

20:03.962 --> 20:05.391
So, how long ago was this?

20:06.617 --> 20:08.984
The night before she sent
me out with Miss Fantasy.

20:10.521 --> 20:13.903
Tommy dumps Leslie, Victor steals from
her. They both end up in the hospital.

20:13.976 --> 20:15.831
She teaching them a lesson?
Could be.

20:15.896 --> 20:18.384
Both were hit on the back of
the head. Faces weren't touched.

20:18.456 --> 20:19.983
Don't damage
that merchandise, baby.

20:20.056 --> 20:22.870
That still doesn't explain our
businessman from St. Louis.

20:22.999 --> 20:25.455
So, maybe it's not the same
perp. Maybe I can help you.

20:25.720 --> 20:28.337
How? Vice just busted a
pro matching the sketch.

20:28.407 --> 20:30.262
Clubbed her john
with a baseball bat.

20:30.775 --> 20:32.630
Bring her in for a lineup.

20:35.063 --> 20:37.005
Do you recognize
any of these women?

20:38.391 --> 20:40.333
Number three.
From where?

20:40.502 --> 20:42.674
She's a regular. I've seen
her with a couple of guys.

20:42.967 --> 20:45.335
Did you see her with Victor
Coe? Come on, counselor.

20:46.678 --> 20:48.402
Thanks for coming in.

20:56.534 --> 20:58.869
Mr. Dowd, do you recognize
any of these women?

21:01.589 --> 21:02.538
She's not there.

21:02.805 --> 21:03.787
You barely looked.

21:03.861 --> 21:06.033
He said she's not there,
Captain. We heard him.

21:06.164 --> 21:08.783
Are you sure?
Yeah. I'm sure.

21:10.580 --> 21:12.336
Tommy, wait for us outside.

21:12.757 --> 21:14.928
Are we through here?
Here, yes.

21:15.093 --> 21:16.849
But Vice has her
for assault one.

21:19.028 --> 21:20.883
That was a bust.
Which leaves us right back...

21:20.948 --> 21:22.061
where we started.
Maybe not.

21:22.132 --> 21:25.263
Lab just called. Says they
got something to show us.

21:25.972 --> 21:29.714
The semen on the sheets from the Hotel
Decameron came back as two distinct types.

21:30.452 --> 21:33.681
She had sex with two men. Because
it's a hotel, we can't be certain.

21:33.747 --> 21:37.325
But check this out. Look at the
fingerprint pattern on the ashtray.

21:38.132 --> 21:39.790
The perp's a lefty.

21:40.275 --> 21:43.438
All the wounds were on the
left side of the victim's head.

21:44.019 --> 21:48.393
Now, I reach with my left hand for
the ashtray, I am holding it like this.

21:49.011 --> 21:53.134
Pattern of the wounds only fit the edge
of the ashtray next to the heel of my hand.

21:53.235 --> 21:54.925
That's impossible.
Exactly.

21:54.994 --> 21:57.994
It's even more pronounced with the
telephone. The attacker grabbed it with...

21:58.065 --> 22:01.776
the thumb on top of the receiver,
fingers underneath the cradle, like this.

22:03.057 --> 22:05.959
There's no way that she could do
that from her position underneath...

22:06.033 --> 22:08.684
and cause that wound pattern on
the left side of Victor's head.

22:08.754 --> 22:10.761
Meaning somebody else
was in both rooms.

22:10.832 --> 22:12.775
Prints on the phone and
the ashtray are identical.

22:12.849 --> 22:14.571
So she had a partner
in her little game.

22:14.641 --> 22:16.976
Judging from the second
semen stain, yes.

22:17.073 --> 22:20.749
So, he saves his damsel in distress from
her would-be rapist and then they have sex?

22:20.817 --> 22:22.955
While the victim lays
bleeding on the floor.

22:23.888 --> 22:25.644
What kind of fantasy is that?

22:29.679 --> 22:31.141
CSU found prints
in the closets...

22:31.215 --> 22:33.637
of both hotel rooms,
and the prints match up...

22:33.713 --> 22:34.825
with the ashtray
and the phone.

22:34.895 --> 22:37.035
They also found semen
in both of the closets.

22:37.103 --> 22:41.031
The DNA is identical to one of the two
stains found on each of the hotel beds.

22:41.103 --> 22:43.405
Whoever Jack and Jill are,
they're not in the system.

22:43.471 --> 22:47.845
So Jack warms up for the big event as
he watches Jill and the victim get it on.

22:47.982 --> 22:50.087
Everybody has fantasies.
Most of them don't run amok.

22:50.158 --> 22:51.719
You know, guy wants to
sleep with Miss October...

22:51.792 --> 22:53.285
his wife wants
to spend 45 minutes...

22:53.359 --> 22:56.141
with the buff construction worker
she sees outside her office window.

22:56.206 --> 22:58.792
Remember that case we worked last
year? The guy had a baby fetish...

22:58.862 --> 23:00.389
he wore diapers
underneath his clothes.

23:00.494 --> 23:03.341
We go to his place. Second
bedroom is set up as a nursery.

23:03.406 --> 23:06.056
Custom-built crib for four.
That's twisted.

23:06.125 --> 23:10.020
If we're done with our trip down memory
lane, can you tell me what else we have?

23:10.126 --> 23:12.133
We canvassed the bellmen
and the doormen.

23:12.206 --> 23:14.028
Nobody remembers a woman
matching the sketch.

23:14.093 --> 23:15.686
We don't know what
her partner looks like.

23:15.757 --> 23:17.862
Tommy Dowd and Victor Coe
got pretty bloodied.

23:17.932 --> 23:19.875
There's no way the perps
didn't get some on themselves.

23:19.948 --> 23:21.704
But the bathrooms
weren't used.

23:22.157 --> 23:24.874
Meaning they had their own
room to clean up and lay low.

23:25.100 --> 23:27.467
Anything on the guest lists?
Still cross-checking.

23:27.532 --> 23:28.514
I'll call Skoda.

23:28.588 --> 23:30.498
If he can tell us about
this couple's pathology...

23:30.572 --> 23:32.459
maybe we can figure out
who they are.

23:35.085 --> 23:36.993
Ever heard the phrase
'Folie a deux'?

23:37.676 --> 23:40.294
Deux is two.
Folie is madness.

23:40.363 --> 23:43.397
Shared madness. I tell you I see
little green men everywhere...

23:43.724 --> 23:45.666
you love me so much,
you start seeing them, too.

23:45.740 --> 23:46.884
That's what this is?

23:47.499 --> 23:50.215
It's like that, except with the
sexual perversion thrown in...

23:50.283 --> 23:52.192
we'd call it
a shared psychotic disorder.

23:52.268 --> 23:56.096
So, I bring you into my sexual
fantasy, and you make it your own.

23:56.299 --> 23:58.055
She gets him
to enter her delusion.

23:58.795 --> 24:03.105
She pretends to be assaulted, he gets
to play the knight in shining armor.

24:03.657 --> 24:06.593
How does something like this get
started? Probably by accident.

24:06.858 --> 24:10.655
Couple's making love, she fights
him a little bit. It excites her.

24:10.763 --> 24:13.183
He fights her back,
it excites her even more.

24:13.257 --> 24:16.966
Turns out to be the best sex they
ever had. Until the fantasy wears thin.

24:17.770 --> 24:19.809
And then they get somebody
else to play the part.

24:19.881 --> 24:22.914
And the husband gets to be the
hero. Maybe they start with a friend.

24:22.986 --> 24:24.807
Or they pick up a businessman
from St. Louis...

24:24.873 --> 24:26.116
only he doesn't want
to play along.

24:26.377 --> 24:29.639
So, then they turn to male escorts.
And when the fantasy evolves?

24:30.409 --> 24:35.045
It becomes such a part of their sexual
ritual, it's the only way they can get aroused.

24:35.144 --> 24:38.276
Their last victim is in a coma.
So, it progresses to violence.

24:38.376 --> 24:41.060
As they sink deeper into the
delusion, the madness escalates.

24:41.128 --> 24:44.543
They become addicts, they
need a stronger fix more often.

24:45.832 --> 24:47.687
Listen, we are going to have
to cut this short.

24:47.752 --> 24:48.701
What's up?

24:48.904 --> 24:52.798
Maid at the Broadway Hotel found
a body in another room. Same M. O...

24:53.288 --> 24:54.717
except this one's dead.

25:06.214 --> 25:07.840
This is getting old.

25:08.102 --> 25:11.998
Gregory Moore, 21, address in
Peekskill. M.E.'s on the way.

25:12.069 --> 25:14.209
Murder weapon?
Crystal vase.

25:14.277 --> 25:16.547
Hit him so hard,
there's brain matter on it.

25:16.646 --> 25:18.140
Somebody must have heard that.

25:18.214 --> 25:19.196
See the pointy edges?

25:19.270 --> 25:22.400
Perp came down hard enough on the victim
with that, one blow would shut him up.

25:22.469 --> 25:25.317
I guess they wanted to make sure
that they got it right this time.

25:26.086 --> 25:29.565
Lab confirms the DNA and prints
match the other two scenes.

25:29.733 --> 25:32.035
We know what escort service
Moore worked for?

25:32.101 --> 25:34.108
He didn't. Moore had no
record with us, either.

25:34.181 --> 25:36.515
But his parents say he was
a student at City University.

25:36.581 --> 25:38.523
That's where Tommy Dowd went
before he dropped out.

25:38.596 --> 25:41.444
Half the city goes there. I
don't believe in coincidences.

25:41.604 --> 25:43.033
Pick Tommy up.

25:44.676 --> 25:47.229
It's too bad Tommy got
himself involved in all this.

25:47.364 --> 25:49.535
He had a choice. He knew
what he was doing was wrong.

25:49.603 --> 25:50.683
I don't know if he wanted to.

25:50.755 --> 25:54.137
It seems like he was just trying
to help his mom save their house.

25:54.532 --> 25:56.637
There are other ways to
make money than prostitution.

25:56.708 --> 25:59.708
What's he going to do, flip burgers
in a fast food joint for minimum wage?

25:59.779 --> 26:02.746
Come on, Elliot, if peddling your
body is okay, what about selling coke?

26:02.820 --> 26:04.477
It's not the same thing.
What do you mean?

26:04.547 --> 26:07.035
All I am saying is that we
shouldn't be worrying about...

26:07.107 --> 26:09.922
who's jumping into the sack
with who, for how much.

26:10.179 --> 26:13.888
The truth is, no matter how we feel about
it, if it's illegal, it is our business.

26:15.683 --> 26:17.853
Leslie called
yesterday afternoon.

26:19.235 --> 26:20.991
Said she needed me right away.

26:21.250 --> 26:22.624
Last minute booking.

26:24.864 --> 26:29.088
I had to meet with lawyers about
the back taxes we owe on the store.

26:30.562 --> 26:32.318
So I called Greg...

26:34.049 --> 26:36.090
asked him if he wanted
some easy money.

26:36.962 --> 26:38.270
What was the job?

26:39.233 --> 26:41.851
Accompany some woman
to a Broadway premiere.

26:43.168 --> 26:45.722
I don't know how they wound up
at that hotel.

26:46.496 --> 26:48.699
Did Leslie know that you
were finding a substitute?

26:48.960 --> 26:49.974
No.

26:50.976 --> 26:52.470
Leslie doesn't know Greg.

26:54.048 --> 26:55.903
He's a buddy from college.

26:56.224 --> 26:59.159
He'd been bugging me for a
chance to try to be an escort.

26:59.552 --> 27:00.926
Now, Tommy, you were the one

27:00.991 --> 27:02.649
who was supposed to be out
on that job.

27:03.199 --> 27:04.792
You think that's
a coincidence?

27:10.207 --> 27:12.378
Leslie's all about business.

27:13.727 --> 27:17.403
I still owe her $28,000.
Killing me makes no sense.

27:17.471 --> 27:19.358
It does if she thought
that you can hurt her.

27:19.966 --> 27:20.916
Can you?

27:22.750 --> 27:27.158
Leslie says she runs a legitimate
escort service. But she's really a pimp.

27:29.309 --> 27:31.219
How often was sex
part of the package?

27:32.637 --> 27:36.118
Client pays an extra $200 an hour,
she gets whatever she wants...

27:36.189 --> 27:37.815
as long as
the escort's willing.

27:38.077 --> 27:39.353
Victor Coe in on that?

27:39.773 --> 27:41.180
Until he got greedy.

27:41.981 --> 27:45.275
Decided if he was performing the
service, he should keep the money himself.

27:45.661 --> 27:48.147
Did Leslie call Victor Coe
the night he was attacked?

27:51.003 --> 27:53.207
She told me
she couldn't find anyone else.

27:55.100 --> 27:56.790
She hired him back
for the night.

28:01.116 --> 28:03.963
I can't believe
she did this on purpose.

28:06.844 --> 28:07.791
Anything?

28:07.867 --> 28:11.348
Victor's LUDs confirmed the call from
Leslie Desantis the night of the attack.

28:11.419 --> 28:14.386
We checked all three hotels'
registration lists. No matching names.

28:14.459 --> 28:16.314
You think Desantis knows
who these people are?

28:16.379 --> 28:18.615
Maybe she helps them
fulfill their fantasies.

28:18.683 --> 28:20.276
Pimps don't just supply
client lists.

28:20.347 --> 28:23.162
They are supposed to provide
protection and screen out the freaks.

28:23.227 --> 28:25.976
So you think she intentionally
sent her escorts to the slaughter?

28:26.074 --> 28:28.310
She sent Tommy Dowd
to these people twice.

28:28.378 --> 28:31.062
I think she knew what she was doing.
That's not enough to arrest her.

28:31.130 --> 28:33.879
It's enough for a search warrant.
But you serve it and she's tipped off.

28:33.945 --> 28:35.188
You're left with pimping
and...

28:35.258 --> 28:37.199
one uncorroborated statement
from a co-conspirator.

28:37.273 --> 28:39.728
Any suggestions, counselor?
We're open to them.

28:40.570 --> 28:42.424
Maybe Tommy Dowd will agree
to wear a wire.

28:42.489 --> 28:43.766
We have nothing to offer him.

28:43.993 --> 28:45.684
Except the chance
to do the right thing...

28:45.753 --> 28:48.568
especially if he feels he's
responsible for his friend's death.

28:49.944 --> 28:51.669
I'm not wearing a wire.

28:52.025 --> 28:55.767
Leslie killed your friend, Tommy.
She tried to kill you twice.

28:55.993 --> 28:59.472
You have no proof. You argued
with her, you got beaten up.

28:59.961 --> 29:02.808
Your friend Victor stole from
her, and now he's in a coma.

29:02.904 --> 29:05.140
That doesn't mean she knows
who this couple is.

29:05.496 --> 29:09.008
Leslie expected you to be in that
hotel room, not your friend Gregory.

29:10.103 --> 29:12.656
If we don't stop her, she's
going to kill someone else.

29:19.287 --> 29:21.905
Water's almost ready.
I'll get the linguine.

29:22.487 --> 29:24.822
What's wrong with you tonight?
You seem so quiet.

29:26.870 --> 29:30.035
Say something, Tommy.
Greg's dead.

29:30.807 --> 29:32.497
Thank God it wasn't you.

29:32.726 --> 29:36.239
He was supposed to escort a woman to
the theatre. Not to the Broadway Hotel.

29:36.374 --> 29:37.803
Client wants you to
spend the night...

29:37.878 --> 29:40.114
it's part of the job.
You get well paid for it.

29:40.278 --> 29:42.644
Getting bludgeoned
isn't part of the job.

29:42.965 --> 29:45.420
Greg's dead,
Victor's still in a coma.

29:45.621 --> 29:49.069
I am sorry about your friend. As
for Victor, he got what he deserved.

29:49.237 --> 29:50.862
Got her.
What about me?

29:50.933 --> 29:55.275
I never meant for you to get hurt. You
think I wouldn't protect my investment?

29:55.349 --> 29:58.196
Come over here.
I'm not in the mood.

29:58.645 --> 30:01.394
What is this?
It's my walkman.

30:01.812 --> 30:03.699
She found it.
Let's move.

30:05.620 --> 30:08.009
You ungrateful little bastard!

30:08.084 --> 30:10.091
Go! Open it! Go!

30:10.355 --> 30:11.304
Police.

30:12.756 --> 30:14.414
Show me your hands!

30:18.643 --> 30:22.221
SVU, detail, 10-54.
We've got severe burns.

30:22.323 --> 30:24.428
Rush a bus
and notify the burn unit.

30:24.499 --> 30:26.887
You know, murdering a witness
is a death penalty crime.

30:26.964 --> 30:29.101
He dies, so do you.
Screw you.

30:32.115 --> 30:34.057
Hang in there, Tommy.
You hang in there.

30:38.610 --> 30:39.919
How bad is he?

30:39.986 --> 30:44.012
Second degree burns on head,
neck, face, arms and hands.

30:44.274 --> 30:46.445
Why did she do it?
She discovered the wire.

30:46.929 --> 30:49.319
Couldn't get to him fast
enough. What do we tell her?

30:49.394 --> 30:50.769
I'm working on it.

30:51.377 --> 30:53.832
Mrs. Dowd, this is our boss,
Captain Cragen...

30:53.905 --> 30:55.847
and the Assistant
District Attorney, Cabot.

30:56.177 --> 30:58.348
We cannot tell you how sorry
we are about this.

30:58.417 --> 30:59.464
How did it happen?

30:59.857 --> 31:02.759
Your son was helping us in the
investigation into who attacked him.

31:02.833 --> 31:04.807
He volunteered to...
You allowed Tommy to do this?

31:04.881 --> 31:07.728
We felt it was the only way...
You should have found another way.

31:07.792 --> 31:09.450
We have the person
who hurt him.

31:09.648 --> 31:11.471
And she's being charged
with attempted murder.

31:11.536 --> 31:15.627
If my son survives, I am sure he will
be glad to hear that. Who approved this?

31:19.215 --> 31:20.164
I did.

31:21.647 --> 31:24.167
Mrs. Dowd, I am...
Look what you did to him.

31:31.407 --> 31:32.716
What do you want us to do?

31:32.782 --> 31:35.782
I need your fives typed and ready
before the inquisition begins.

31:47.086 --> 31:48.581
I am sorry about your friend.

31:48.654 --> 31:50.694
As for Victor,
he got what he deserved.

31:53.326 --> 31:54.405
They're just words.

31:54.701 --> 31:56.938
Which establish a motive
for the attack on Victor Coe.

31:57.005 --> 31:58.052
You can't prove intent.

31:58.125 --> 31:59.074
Can't I?
No.

31:59.149 --> 32:00.098
Tommy Dowd was beaten.

32:00.174 --> 32:02.726
He would've been murdered if Gregory
Moore hadn't filled in for him.

32:02.798 --> 32:06.310
I had nothing do with that. Ask
your attorney to explain it to you.

32:06.380 --> 32:09.862
You set Dowd up, Moore was killed in
his place. That makes you responsible.

32:10.477 --> 32:13.575
Tommy Dowd with his disfigured face
should be a very compelling witness.

32:13.709 --> 32:15.432
He won't testify against me.

32:15.533 --> 32:17.386
Why do you think
he agreed to wear a wire?

32:17.708 --> 32:20.577
He knew you were trying to kill
him. I didn't try to kill anyone.

32:20.652 --> 32:22.310
It was just business.
Leslie...

32:22.379 --> 32:24.966
These women don't know if
someone loves them or their money.

32:25.036 --> 32:26.563
I provide companionship.

32:26.635 --> 32:28.326
You are nothing
but a high-priced pimp.

32:28.683 --> 32:31.269
And like a pimp, you use violence
to keep your stable in line.

32:31.340 --> 32:33.282
I still haven't heard
the word "Deal."

32:33.868 --> 32:36.452
Man one on Gregory Moore and she
gives me the couple who killed him.

32:36.778 --> 32:38.567
She didn't kill him.
Assault two on Dowd.

32:38.634 --> 32:41.220
No deal on Dowd. It's man one
or nothing. Take it or leave it.

32:41.291 --> 32:45.000
Listen to me. I have no idea
who those people are.

32:46.763 --> 32:48.007
Why should I believe you?

32:48.970 --> 32:49.953
Check my records.

32:50.026 --> 32:52.414
All three times, they called in
a different credit card number.

32:52.490 --> 32:55.838
Sometimes a man, sometimes a woman.
I didn't know it was the same couple.

32:59.849 --> 33:02.566
Leslie's not lying. Second and
third escort reservations...

33:02.633 --> 33:04.542
were also made with
stolen credit card numbers.

33:04.617 --> 33:08.195
We checked the names against the
guest lists in both hotels. No matches.

33:08.265 --> 33:09.923
The perps had to get
the numbers somewhere.

33:09.994 --> 33:10.976
Common denominators?

33:11.049 --> 33:14.180
All of the cards were used within
the last month for purchases from...

33:14.248 --> 33:15.492
different
mail order companies.

33:15.561 --> 33:16.969
That doesn't sound promising.

33:17.032 --> 33:19.520
Except that the companies
operate out of the same warehouse.

33:19.593 --> 33:21.251
Scott Distributing,
Dutchess County.

33:21.321 --> 33:24.223
So, whoever's billing the credit card
companies is stealing the numbers.

33:24.297 --> 33:27.428
Their accountants handle the billing.
A powerhouse firm on 3rd Avenue.

33:30.535 --> 33:34.332
I'll help you any way I can, detectives,
but I'm sure nobody here is responsible.

33:34.696 --> 33:36.997
Who can we talk to about
the Scott account?

33:37.063 --> 33:40.772
Gary Sutton's the senior who runs
it, but I think he left early today.

33:41.126 --> 33:43.876
In the middle of tax season?
Even accountants have a life.

33:43.944 --> 33:47.042
It's his anniversary. I think they
were going to a show and dinner.

33:49.191 --> 33:50.914
Is there any way that
we could reach him?

33:50.982 --> 33:53.371
I doubt his cell phone is on
if he's in the theatre.

33:53.446 --> 33:54.974
Is this Mrs. Sutton?

33:55.206 --> 33:58.075
Darlene.
Olivia, she look familiar?

34:00.389 --> 34:01.818
The couple from the hotel.

34:02.853 --> 34:04.195
From Altoona.
You got it.

34:04.262 --> 34:05.506
Is something wrong?

34:05.701 --> 34:07.938
We are going to need
Mr. Sutton's home address.

34:08.261 --> 34:10.116
Sure. Let me get that for you.

34:24.965 --> 34:26.458
Playbills.

34:27.301 --> 34:28.511
Like the theatre.

34:38.531 --> 34:41.826
Look at this, on the night table.
Didn't even bother to hide them.

34:41.956 --> 34:42.938
Check out the one on top.

34:43.138 --> 34:45.725
Joseph Woodward. Our friend
from Altoona, Pennsylvania.

34:45.795 --> 34:47.935
An accountant, he has rich
clients, pays their bills.

34:48.003 --> 34:49.597
He can order himself
a credit card in their names.

34:49.667 --> 34:50.911
The ones he doesn't
have cards for...

34:50.978 --> 34:53.563
he uses over the phones.
We got to run these numbers.

34:55.010 --> 34:57.214
Have Munch and Fin meet
us there. Find anything?

34:57.282 --> 35:00.762
One of the numbers was used to book
an escort. 7:00, Madison Terrace Hotel.

35:00.835 --> 35:02.557
That's 15 minutes from now.

35:03.906 --> 35:05.728
Excuse me.
Be with you in a second.

35:05.795 --> 35:07.453
Police. Now.

35:09.057 --> 35:11.000
What is it?
She in here tonight?

35:13.666 --> 35:16.121
She was with that guy
over there. Just walked out.

35:19.393 --> 35:21.466
He still here?
Fortunately for him.

35:23.937 --> 35:25.279
Meeting someone?

35:26.272 --> 35:27.483
Who are you?
Police.

35:27.553 --> 35:29.974
What room is she in?
What are you talking about?

35:30.048 --> 35:31.675
Come on.
You are an escort, right?

35:31.745 --> 35:33.567
You just gave this woman
the key to your room?

35:33.633 --> 35:35.159
She told you to
wait five minutes...

35:35.232 --> 35:36.661
and follow her.
You were about to go up?

35:36.736 --> 35:38.972
And if I was? Then this is
the luckiest day of your life.

35:39.040 --> 35:40.469
We need your room number
and your room key.

35:45.374 --> 35:46.901
526.

36:05.055 --> 36:07.542
Is someone there?
What do you want with me?

36:07.614 --> 36:09.240
Police! Show me your hands!
Don't shoot!

36:09.373 --> 36:11.447
Help me, Gary!
Hands behind your back now!

36:11.518 --> 36:13.427
Fantasy's over, Darlene.
Get up.

36:13.502 --> 36:15.957
Let's see the hands. Up now.
You didn't save me, you bastard!

36:16.030 --> 36:17.819
Here, put the robe on.
Let's go.

36:22.109 --> 36:23.603
I get home one night...

36:25.501 --> 36:26.876
I hear noises.

36:29.853 --> 36:31.446
Go into the bedroom.

36:33.212 --> 36:34.805
Some guy's on top of Darlene.

36:36.029 --> 36:38.996
They're struggling.
I thought he was raping her.

36:39.579 --> 36:41.041
What did you do?

36:41.949 --> 36:43.291
Yanked him off.

36:44.604 --> 36:46.937
Roughed him up.
Did you call the police?

36:48.860 --> 36:51.477
Darlene told me
he was a delivery guy.

36:52.988 --> 36:54.231
She invited him in.

36:58.522 --> 36:59.930
She knew I was coming home.

37:03.451 --> 37:04.912
I was her hero.

37:06.457 --> 37:07.668
I saved her.

37:10.491 --> 37:11.473
It turned me on.

37:13.371 --> 37:14.417
We let the guy go.

37:14.714 --> 37:16.885
Were the escorts
your idea or hers?

37:18.937 --> 37:19.886
Hers.

37:22.201 --> 37:26.194
She picked up some guy from out of town,
but he didn't want to play the game.

37:28.409 --> 37:32.271
Darlene figured we'd get what
we want if we paid for it.

37:32.825 --> 37:34.167
You went along with this?

37:35.833 --> 37:37.174
Don't you understand?

37:38.681 --> 37:39.630
I love her.

37:43.256 --> 37:44.914
She's got a problem.

37:45.305 --> 37:47.344
She kept picking up these men.

37:47.896 --> 37:50.132
You could've stopped
playing her game. No.

37:52.375 --> 37:53.838
She needed me to do this.

37:57.624 --> 37:59.511
I didn't mean to kill anybody.

38:02.295 --> 38:03.756
I got drawn into it.

38:07.894 --> 38:09.553
It just happened.

38:17.974 --> 38:19.697
I don't believe this.

38:19.830 --> 38:21.902
Maybe murder two and
two counts of assault one...

38:21.974 --> 38:23.468
will bring him back
to reality.

38:23.830 --> 38:25.422
It's not him
I'm worried about.

38:26.197 --> 38:29.459
She will get a lawyer who will come
up with some designer psych defense.

38:29.558 --> 38:32.143
She's just as guilty as he is.
But he's the killer.

38:33.014 --> 38:34.257
She'll sell him out.

38:34.326 --> 38:36.812
So she walks,
and he does 25 to life.

38:38.133 --> 38:40.140
I wonder what
he's fantasizing about now.

38:47.893 --> 38:49.681
Gary said...

38:51.060 --> 38:52.969
he would kill for me.

38:58.100 --> 39:01.580
It was the most powerful
aphrodisiac I've ever felt.

39:06.388 --> 39:07.501
He saved my life.

39:10.483 --> 39:13.712
Who did he rescue you from?
The men.

39:16.786 --> 39:20.681
In the store, on the subway,
in the street.

39:22.418 --> 39:23.759
They would look at me.

39:25.682 --> 39:28.911
I knew if they had the chance,
they would ravage me.

39:31.954 --> 39:33.132
I told Gary.

39:36.817 --> 39:38.158
It made him...

39:40.497 --> 39:41.446
wild.

39:43.761 --> 39:44.710
An animal.

39:47.889 --> 39:48.935
That...

39:50.928 --> 39:53.350
businessman, he wouldn't play,
but...

39:54.736 --> 39:55.850
the escorts...

39:57.264 --> 39:59.599
they would do anything
that I wanted.

40:03.375 --> 40:04.870
All the time...

40:05.744 --> 40:07.402
I'd be thinking about Gary.

40:10.031 --> 40:11.111
The brave...

40:12.559 --> 40:13.933
strong man...

40:16.079 --> 40:17.420
how he would save me.

40:20.238 --> 40:21.930
Take care of him for me.

40:28.622 --> 40:30.029
Can I go home now?

40:33.997 --> 40:36.682
You're not going home,
Darlene. You're going to jail.

40:40.525 --> 40:42.183
I can't go to jail.

40:45.133 --> 40:47.075
The inmates, the guards...

40:48.429 --> 40:49.989
what would they do to me?

40:58.957 --> 41:01.160
You will protect me.

41:02.124 --> 41:03.302
Won't you?
