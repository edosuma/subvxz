she is likely off-world by now.

06:19.855 --> 06:24.125

[Vandal] I believe
you're shepherds

06:27.595 --> 06:29.596
Tell us where Halo is!

06:29.663 --> 06:32.399
That is precisely why I'm here.

06:32.466 --> 06:34.401
I know you have a Motherbox.

06:34.468 --> 06:36.704
I'm here to offer coordinates,

06:36.771 --> 06:40.074
so you can boomtube
to Ms. Harper's location.

06:40.141 --> 06:41.110
What's the catch?

06:41.175 --> 06:45.146
The catch, as you put it,
is this.

You promise to tell
her abductor exactly
who sent you.

06:54.088 --> 06:56.158

I can't reach Thirteen.

06:56.225 --> 06:58.692

she was at the Tower of Fate,
training with Zatanna.

06:58.759 --> 07:00.495
We'll manage.

07:00.562 --> 07:02.863
I know.
But it's a team mission
to recover one of our own.

07:02.930 --> 07:04.132
And she's part of the Team.

07:04.199 --> 07:06.000

07:10.338 --> 07:11.773
I'm going.

07:11.839 --> 07:13.841
I do not believe we could
keep him here if we tried.

07:13.908 --> 07:15.744
[Nightwing] You think?

07:15.810 --> 07:17.612
Which is why I am going.

07:17.678 --> 07:19.880
I promised Barbara
I would watch over him.

07:19.947 --> 07:21.615
And since you're going...

07:21.682 --> 07:23.550
I am strictly back-up.

07:23.617 --> 07:26.588
As you said,
Halo is your teammate.

07:26.654 --> 07:31.160
This is your team,
your mission.

07:31.225 --> 07:34.262
I know I'm an Outsider,
but I'm going, too.

07:34.329 --> 07:35.497
And no one can stop me.

07:35.562 --> 07:36.964
No one's trying to stop you.

07:37.031 --> 07:38.600

into the unknown here.

07:38.668 --> 07:41.603

you can keep your head
on this mission,

07:41.670 --> 07:43.838

07:43.904 --> 07:48.855

that's not my role.

I hate being a leader.

07:59.586 --> 08:01.488
You keep sayin' that,

08:01.555 --> 08:03.423
but you already are a leader.

08:03.490 --> 08:05.726
So maybe the real question is,

08:05.793 --> 08:10.793
what kind of leader
do you want to be?
