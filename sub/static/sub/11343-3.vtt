WEBVTT

00:02.097 --> 00:03.974
'In the criminal justice system,

00:04.017 --> 00:07.532
'sexually based offences
are considered especially heinous.

00:07.577 --> 00:11.570
'In New York City, the detectives
who investigate these vicious felonies

00:11.617 --> 00:15.053
'are members of an elite squad
known as the Special Victims Unit.

00:15.097 --> 00:17.133
'These are their stories.'

00:18.497 --> 00:22.285
- How are you tonight, Mrs Johnson?
- I think I've got the AIDS again.

00:22.337 --> 00:25.647
Oh, that and I've had a heart attack.

00:25.697 --> 00:28.734
- And the Ebola?
- Your pills cleared that all up.

00:28.777 --> 00:31.610
OK. Let's take a look at you.

00:31.657 --> 00:34.615
See what their problem is.

00:35.617 --> 00:37.733
Happily.

00:37.777 --> 00:40.735
Hey! This is a hospital!

00:42.337 --> 00:44.055
Dr Lakh!

00:46.137 --> 00:50.016
- Crime scene information?
- She was dumped on the street.

00:51.537 --> 00:56.167
School ID's Theresa Burgess.
She's from Queens. This backpack is hers.

00:56.217 --> 00:58.492
Pretty girl.

00:58.537 --> 01:02.212
Until someone did this to her.

01:02.257 --> 01:07.092
- I'm Dr Lakh. I was on when she came in.
- What happened to her?

01:07.137 --> 01:10.413
A vicious attack. Double puncture wounds.

01:10.457 --> 01:13.290
Neat little set of two.
Maybe a claw hammer.

01:13.337 --> 01:17.376
- Will she pull through?
- I stitched over 30 wounds.

01:17.417 --> 01:21.456
Face, breasts, genitals.
The wounds will heal.

01:21.497 --> 01:22.976
But?

01:23.017 --> 01:26.851
An apparent amphetamine overdose
worries me more. Damage is severe.

01:26.897 --> 01:30.492
The respirator's doing
her breathing for her.

01:31.777 --> 01:33.415
There's something else.

01:33.457 --> 01:37.245
- She was raped with a wooden object.
- What's that?

01:38.257 --> 01:39.531
Splinters.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.074

02:31.577 --> 02:36.128
Her name's Theresa Burgess.
She's 16. A model. This is her portfolio.

02:36.177 --> 02:37.735
Want to fill us in?

02:37.777 --> 02:42.407
She was dumped outside
Roosevelt Emergency Room at 3.33am.

02:42.457 --> 02:47.451
E&T saw a late-model sports utility vehicle,
dark red or black.

02:47.497 --> 02:51.729
The vic was repeatedly stabbed
with a claw hammer

02:51.777 --> 02:56.487
and raped with a wooden object.
She is at present in a coma.

02:56.537 --> 02:59.768
Prescription amphetamines
were found in her knapsack,

02:59.817 --> 03:04.607
consistent with her overdose symptoms.
A rape kit is at the lab.

03:04.657 --> 03:08.969
- It's someone who knows her.
- Sure. Tell us who, we'll go home.

03:09.017 --> 03:13.727
Face, breasts, genitals.
That says, 'Bitch, I'm going to erase you.'

03:13.777 --> 03:18.692
He drops her off at the ER.
Classic signs of remorse and familiarity.

03:18.737 --> 03:22.696
Some loser could have fantasised
a relationship with her.

03:22.737 --> 03:25.297
Like Mark David Chapman
with John Lennon.

03:25.337 --> 03:27.805
Her picture is everywhere.

03:27.857 --> 03:32.453
I spent a lunch hour staring at her
billboard for a conditioning rinse.

03:32.497 --> 03:35.216
Felt like I had a relationship with her.

03:35.257 --> 03:38.772
Her last appointment
was a photo shoot at 27th Street.

03:38.817 --> 03:42.207
Uniform's got the names of 12 others
that were at that shoot.

03:42.257 --> 03:44.452
- Where's the family?
- Mother's upstate.

03:44.497 --> 03:47.330
Father was at home in Queens
at the time.

03:47.377 --> 03:51.655
- While his kid was out at 3am?
- Tell me about it.

03:51.697 --> 03:55.212
- He's with her now.
- Be sympathetic but not too.

03:55.257 --> 03:58.135
You guys, take statements from the models.

03:58.177 --> 04:01.533
- Anybody in court?
- Yeah. Me. Comic-book guy.

04:01.577 --> 04:06.890
Ah. Jeffries vs Rape Man.
That's equal to Godzilla vs Megalon.

04:06.937 --> 04:09.576
- My money's on Jeffries.
- Thanks.

04:09.617 --> 04:11.573
Mine, too. I'll double that bet.

04:13.137 --> 04:17.528
Mr Burgess. Detective Benson.
This is Detective Stabler.

04:17.577 --> 04:21.012
- Who did this?
- At this point an unknown assailant.

04:21.057 --> 04:24.015
This city! It's a cesspool.

04:24.057 --> 04:29.051
- These things can happen everywhere.
- Especially at night, with a minor.

04:29.097 --> 04:35.013
- Jazmin was old for her age.
- Jazmin? Isn't her name Theresa?

04:35.057 --> 04:37.935
We changed it. It's a trademark.

04:37.977 --> 04:41.367
Trademark? Like Jewel or Cher?

04:43.377 --> 04:46.335
Sounds kind of silly, doesn't it?

04:46.377 --> 04:49.528
But we had big plans together.

04:49.577 --> 04:51.807
When did you last see her?

04:54.057 --> 04:57.208
I dropped her off at the shoot
around six o'clock.

04:59.417 --> 05:02.250
And then what?

05:02.297 --> 05:06.051
They don't like parents hanging around.

05:07.057 --> 05:10.015
I should've called. I was worried sick.

05:10.057 --> 05:14.175
But I didn't want to seem
like a troublemaker.

05:14.217 --> 05:18.256
Your daughter's missing at 3am
and you worry about being a troublemaker?

05:18.297 --> 05:21.255
I know how foolish that sounds.

05:22.657 --> 05:26.696
My beautiful daughter.
She wanted to become something.

05:26.737 --> 05:29.695
And I would do anything for her.

05:29.737 --> 05:34.447
Her agent said I shouldn't worry.
And I trusted her.

05:34.497 --> 05:37.569
- Who is this agent?
- Nina Laszlo.

05:39.977 --> 05:42.935
- How's Jazmin doing?
- Not well.

05:42.977 --> 05:45.855
If this could happen to her
it could happen to anyone.

05:46.617 --> 05:48.096
Everyone loved her.

05:48.137 --> 05:51.095
The past tense is a bit premature.

05:51.137 --> 05:53.890
All of my girls are afraid to go out.

05:53.937 --> 05:57.009
Bad for business.
You were her chaperone Monday night?

05:57.057 --> 06:01.573
Her chaperone? I handle over 150 models.

06:01.617 --> 06:05.610
- All of them minors?
- I don't fire them on their 18th birthdays.

06:05.657 --> 06:06.976
Was Jazmin the lead?

06:07.017 --> 06:10.487
Yes. But there were eight other girls
on the shoot.

06:10.537 --> 06:14.894
- I went to the set and then left.
- What time was that?

06:14.937 --> 06:17.007
About 10:00.

06:18.337 --> 06:21.090
The doctor said Jazmin
was using amphetamines.

06:21.137 --> 06:23.970
- Oh?
- Do you know anything about that?

06:24.017 --> 06:27.407
- No.
- Who was in charge after you left?

06:27.457 --> 06:30.210
In charge in what sense?

06:30.257 --> 06:35.411
You had underage models working
after midnight. Who was in charge?

06:37.897 --> 06:41.367
I suppose the photographer, Carlo Parisi.

06:43.337 --> 06:47.967
- Are we boring you?
- A little. Yes.

06:48.017 --> 06:51.248
This is a huge, huge business, Detective.

06:51.297 --> 06:56.087
The girls will do whatever it takes
to get where they want to be.

06:56.137 --> 07:00.289
- That include Roosevelt Hospital?
- Please.

07:00.337 --> 07:03.090
- Miss Laszlo?
- What?

07:03.137 --> 07:07.210
- What kind of car do you drive?
- An Acura. White. Why?

07:07.257 --> 07:10.010
Just asking.

07:10.057 --> 07:12.491
- Try to look alive.
- Carlo Parisi?

07:12.537 --> 07:15.574
- Not now!
- Carlo Parisi!

07:15.617 --> 07:18.848
Just stay there.

07:18.897 --> 07:19.966
Who are you?

07:20.017 --> 07:24.454
Detective Benson. Detective Stabler.
You photographed Jazmin on Monday.

07:24.497 --> 07:28.331
We need to account
for her comings and goings.

07:28.377 --> 07:29.605
Good luck.

07:29.657 --> 07:33.286
Let's start again.
You need to account for her.

07:33.337 --> 07:37.888
All right. Her father dropped her off
at around 6:00, I think.

07:37.937 --> 07:43.694
We got going around midnight
and wrapped around 3:00 or 4:00.

07:43.737 --> 07:47.173
- When did Jazmin leave?
- I don't remember.

07:47.217 --> 07:51.768
When I'm shooting,
I go right-brained. Time slips away.

07:51.817 --> 07:57.210
Did she have a friend or somebody
that kept tabs on her whereabouts?

07:57.257 --> 08:02.377
On set, there's so much energy
you're wired. It's all a blur after a while.

08:02.417 --> 08:06.649
- Adrenalin or methedrine?
- Come on. I run a clean set.

08:06.697 --> 08:10.975
Been off everything stronger than
cappuccino for 17 months, four days.

08:11.017 --> 08:13.292
How about the girls?

08:13.337 --> 08:17.216
This is Giuliani New York.
I thought you guys won the drug war, eh?

08:17.257 --> 08:21.091
- What kind of car do you drive?
- A Porsche Boxster.

08:21.137 --> 08:23.935
Now, if you'll excuse me...

08:23.977 --> 08:26.935
- We'll excuse you.
- Thank you.

08:26.977 --> 08:29.935
Pardon me. You look familiar to me.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.933
I modelled when I was younger.

08:31.977 --> 08:34.696
You testified against Ricky Blaine,
didn't you?

08:34.736 --> 08:39.413
Good memory. A lot of girls
testified against the Measuring Man.

08:39.457 --> 08:40.809
Who's that?

08:40.857 --> 08:45.612
Skank. A guy who posed as a modelling
scout to get girls' measurements.

08:45.657 --> 08:49.127
- Got their confidence and then...
- Sexual assault?

08:49.177 --> 08:52.089
- He did it for years.
- Nobody turned him in?

08:52.137 --> 08:55.095
He threatened them.
If they told, they'd never work.

08:55.137 --> 08:57.697
Where are the parents, the managers?

08:57.737 --> 08:59.614
You see creeps like him every day.

08:59.657 --> 09:02.410
Finally they got him. He's doing time.

09:02.457 --> 09:05.255
Not any more. He just got out.

09:05.297 --> 09:09.654
They sent me a postcard.
20 cents for victims' rights.

09:13.297 --> 09:16.130
Ricky Blaine!

09:17.137 --> 09:19.856
- We'll take this hammer.
- It belongs to the shop.

09:19.897 --> 09:22.775
They'll have to take it out of your pay.

09:22.817 --> 09:27.891
- Look, I'm clean, I'm employed...
- And you rough up pretty women.

09:27.937 --> 09:32.169
- That was years ago.
- Old habits die hard.

09:32.217 --> 09:36.210
You measure 'em, get to know'em,
beat the crap out of 'em.

09:36.257 --> 09:41.126
Call my PO.
I haven't touched a piece of tape in years.

09:41.177 --> 09:45.614
We did just that.
You were late for your Monday check-in.

09:45.657 --> 09:50.936
He said next time you are tardy,
you'll spend time in the catacombs.

09:50.977 --> 09:53.366
Monday night?

09:53.417 --> 09:57.205
This is about that creamy-complected
little sweetie who got attacked.

09:57.257 --> 10:01.170
- I saw it in Women's Wear Daily.
- Did you know her?

10:01.217 --> 10:05.130
Her K-mart underwear ads
were primo monkey-spank fuel.

10:05.177 --> 10:07.645
Great. Where were you Monday night?

10:07.697 --> 10:10.689
Watching football at the halfway house.

10:10.737 --> 10:14.173
- Who was playing?
- Jets and Steelers.

10:14.217 --> 10:16.811
Try again. Cowboys, 49ers.

10:16.857 --> 10:21.647
We must have been talking.
You have great bone structure.

10:21.697 --> 10:24.973
34, 25, 36.

10:25.017 --> 10:27.770
What are you, A-cup?

10:27.817 --> 10:33.096
I still know people in the business.
I could make a couple of calls for...

10:33.137 --> 10:36.652
- Argh!
- OK, let's empty your pockets.

10:36.697 --> 10:40.133
If we find a measuring tape,
we'll take you in on parole violation.

10:40.177 --> 10:44.648
- I was trying to help.
- You were trying to measure me.

10:45.697 --> 10:48.769
Do yourself a favour.
Stay home and watch football.

10:48.817 --> 10:53.686
After spending a day with beautiful women,
we got some information.

10:53.737 --> 10:54.931
Give it up.

10:54.977 --> 10:59.528
Jazmin was booted out at midnight
for failing a weigh-in.

10:59.577 --> 11:02.091
- A weigh-in?
- Like a prize fight.

11:02.137 --> 11:07.131
Carlo weighs all the models there.
If they don't make the grade, they don't work.

11:07.177 --> 11:10.852
Jazmin was 5'7' and weighed 110lbs,
so he kicked her out.

11:10.897 --> 11:15.049
- 110lbs is too heavy?
- They told her to lose 8lbs.

11:15.097 --> 11:19.090
She made some weepy phone calls
then went to Carlo's private office.

11:19.137 --> 11:20.411
Why?

11:20.457 --> 11:25.611
She came out insulting his parentage
so he told her to pack it in.

11:25.657 --> 11:28.808
- Any drugs at the shoot?
- The girls said not.

11:28.857 --> 11:32.008
- Which means they're all using.
- Any girls close to Jazmin?

11:32.057 --> 11:35.527
She left with a girlfriend, Vanessa Wong.
We're looking for her.

11:35.577 --> 11:38.808
- Girlfriend how?
- They're not KD Lang fans.

11:38.857 --> 11:41.655
- Have you got an address?
- Here.

11:43.857 --> 11:48.487
We want to know what drugs she's on,
whether she's sexually active.

11:48.537 --> 11:50.732
Girlfriends have no secrets.

11:50.777 --> 11:53.575
Sounds like a song.

11:55.377 --> 11:58.414
Hey! Lennie Briscoe!
What are you doing here?

11:58.457 --> 12:01.255
We heard there was good dim sum here.
Eddie Green.

12:01.297 --> 12:04.209
- My partner, Olivia Benson.
- How you doing?

12:04.257 --> 12:05.736
What are you doing here?

12:05.777 --> 12:08.928
Rape and assault. We want to see
Jazmin Burgess's friend.

12:08.977 --> 12:11.286
Vanessa Wong? You missed her.

12:11.337 --> 12:14.374
She was pulled out of a dumpster
this morning.

12:14.417 --> 12:18.330
- Claw hammer. Early AM.
- Yeah. What, you've read my notes?

12:18.377 --> 12:19.935
No. You've read ours.

12:19.977 --> 12:23.936
- Catch a big break on the case?
- Your vic was our star witness.

12:30.057 --> 12:32.446
All right, guys, here we go.

12:41.297 --> 12:44.369
- What's up for school today?
- We have a test.

12:44.417 --> 12:48.808
- Is that all you're gonna eat?
- Mm-hm.

12:48.857 --> 12:52.645
It's a school day.
I think you need more than that.

12:52.697 --> 12:55.609
No, I really don't want... Dad!

12:56.617 --> 12:59.973
That's all saturated fat
and I'm not gonna eat it.

13:00.017 --> 13:01.973
Just push it around with your fork.

13:02.017 --> 13:03.496
Elliot?

13:06.617 --> 13:09.893
Guys. Don't talk about me. I'm right here.

13:09.937 --> 13:11.848
How long's that been going on?

13:11.897 --> 13:14.650
- The anorexic routine? Weeks.
- Great.

13:14.697 --> 13:16.892
- If you came home...
- I do my best.

13:16.937 --> 13:19.815
I know, but I can't do it all alone.

13:21.977 --> 13:24.730
She listens to you.

13:24.777 --> 13:28.565
All right. I'll come home, I promise.

13:28.617 --> 13:31.495
Hey. Your breakfast is getting cold.

13:31.537 --> 13:34.449
Thanks for telling me.

13:41.537 --> 13:46.565
Maureen, what do you say we talk
about food? You know, nutrition.

13:46.617 --> 13:48.608
No.

13:53.577 --> 13:57.536
- Hey, Uncle Lennie.
- Ken! Say hi to Eddie Green.

13:57.577 --> 14:02.014
Cool it with the Uncle Lennie stuff
around the station.

14:02.057 --> 14:06.414
- What shall I call you?
- Save it for family court.

14:06.457 --> 14:09.893
- Call me Briscoe.
- What will you call me?

14:09.937 --> 14:11.928
Briscoe.

14:11.977 --> 14:15.208
- Hey! Lennie!
- Just like a nightmare.

14:15.257 --> 14:18.329
Lennie Briscoe, Eddie Green from the 2-7.

14:18.377 --> 14:22.336
- I thought I'd put'em to work.
- We already did your work for you.

14:22.377 --> 14:25.494
We found your witness. She was dead.

14:25.537 --> 14:29.689
Same time, same weapon
as our rape vic. They were friends.

14:29.737 --> 14:31.216
What have you got on her?

14:31.257 --> 14:34.090
PCR typing won't be in until next week.

14:34.137 --> 14:38.608
Rape kit came back positive for oral
contact. Benzedrine in her system.

14:38.657 --> 14:41.535
Bennie abusers are paranoid.
They don't sleep.

14:41.577 --> 14:44.489
I caught a speed freak once. DOA.

14:44.537 --> 14:49.452
So many booby traps, he blew himself
through the bathroom door.

14:49.497 --> 14:54.969
We had to make a bomb-squad pile,
coroner's pile and a whatever pile.

14:55.017 --> 14:56.814
- That's great.
- OK.

14:56.857 --> 15:01.851
So, Jazmin stays on set
until some time between 12:00 and 1:00,

15:01.897 --> 15:04.650
when she leaves with Vanessa Wong.

15:04.697 --> 15:09.646
Next we know, at 3:30 she's dumped
in front of the emergency room.

15:09.697 --> 15:13.133
- The friend was found where?
- Two blocks from the hospital.

15:13.177 --> 15:16.692
- Did the Measuring Man know her?
- He really was watching football.

15:16.737 --> 15:19.251
He just enjoys the halftime show better.

15:19.297 --> 15:23.529
- What about the star-stalker angle?
- The second girl's not as famous.

15:23.577 --> 15:27.365
- I still say it's an acquaintance.
- Any names?

15:27.417 --> 15:32.207
We got call records to see
where she was for those two hours.

15:32.257 --> 15:36.853
At 12:20 she called her mother.
We'll be talking to her.

15:36.897 --> 15:41.766
Four times between 12:34 and 1:02
she called an apartment.

15:41.817 --> 15:44.968
It's owned by a Hampton Trill.

15:45.017 --> 15:47.690
Hampton Trill? He would be involved.

15:47.737 --> 15:49.693
- You know him?
- From his novels.

15:49.737 --> 15:53.252
Brat-packy poseur,
was published when he was 19.

15:53.297 --> 15:56.255
Thinks he's the Émile Zola
of pre-millennial Manhattan.

15:56.297 --> 16:01.735
Go talk to him, then. OK?
You guys talk to the mom. Lennie?

16:01.777 --> 16:03.768
Let's talk.

16:08.177 --> 16:12.329
- Mrs Burgess?
- I'm Sue Burgess. Theresa's mother.

16:12.377 --> 16:15.926
Detective Benson. Detective Stabler.
How is she?

16:15.977 --> 16:18.730
All we can do is pray at this point.

16:18.777 --> 16:22.770
She called you the night this happened.
What did you talk about?

16:22.817 --> 16:27.413
Theresa was crying.
This photographer, Parisi,

16:27.457 --> 16:30.255
said some really mean things to her.

16:30.297 --> 16:35.291
She wanted out of the business.
I said she could come home any time.

16:35.337 --> 16:38.135
When did you and Mr Burgess separate?

16:38.177 --> 16:40.975
Right before Thanksgiving of 1997.

16:41.017 --> 16:45.966
It all started when Theresa was 13
and she won $700 in a contest.

16:46.017 --> 16:49.327
Tom decided Theresa was his ticket up.

16:49.377 --> 16:52.972
He said her name was changed
to Jazmin.

16:53.017 --> 16:55.929
Theresa is her Christian name.

16:55.977 --> 16:58.537
That Jazmin business was all Tom's idea.

16:58.577 --> 17:01.091
Everything that happened is his fault.

17:01.137 --> 17:04.732
- What do you mean by that?
- He got custody.

17:04.777 --> 17:09.167
When he's taking her to these contests
and not working in any job,

17:09.217 --> 17:14.051
I have to work days at a glassware plant
and nights at a Wal-Mart.

17:14.097 --> 17:18.534
The courts say I'm unfit
because I'm not home enough.

17:19.817 --> 17:23.810
- I'm sorry.
- That broke up our home.

17:30.217 --> 17:34.176
Detective Jeffries,
you testified that you found evidence

17:34.217 --> 17:37.129
to charge the father with rape,

17:37.177 --> 17:42.774
even though the assault was committed
by his 13-year-old son.

17:42.817 --> 17:44.216
That is correct.

17:44.257 --> 17:48.216
While the father,
who had never met the victim, was at work.

17:48.257 --> 17:51.966
So, how does that work?

17:52.017 --> 17:55.566
That a man who never meets a victim,

17:55.617 --> 18:00.816
isn't there when the act is committed,
and yet is responsible?

18:00.857 --> 18:04.850
We found evidence that the son
was being raised in an atmosphere

18:04.897 --> 18:06.535
that condoned rape.

18:06.577 --> 18:09.455
Oh, so you did.

18:09.497 --> 18:13.536
You searched his house.
Did you find Playboy?

18:13.577 --> 18:18.526
Penthouse? Hustler magazine?
X-rated video tapes?

18:18.577 --> 18:22.126
- No, we did not.
- You found comic books.

18:22.177 --> 18:23.815
Yes.

18:23.857 --> 18:27.406
You found comic books.

18:28.657 --> 18:29.976
No further questions.

18:30.017 --> 18:32.895
Redirect, Your Honour.

18:35.177 --> 18:38.135
Do you recognise this comic book?

18:38.177 --> 18:43.251
Yes. It's called Rape Man.
It was seized from the defendant's home.

18:43.297 --> 18:48.166
Rape Man? And what kind of stories
are you likely to read in this...

18:48.217 --> 18:50.173
Rape Man?

18:50.217 --> 18:54.176
It's about the adventures
of a high-school boy

18:54.217 --> 18:56.970
who by night is a masked superhero.

18:57.017 --> 19:01.329
He settles scores with women
by raping them.

19:01.377 --> 19:03.129
But it's in Japanese.

19:03.177 --> 19:06.931
It's clear from the imagery what's going on.

19:06.977 --> 19:11.846
The stories end with pictures
of women being beaten and raped

19:11.897 --> 19:14.775
by the... hero.

19:14.817 --> 19:19.766
And from these stories, you charged
the father with accessory to rape?

19:19.817 --> 19:22.490
These comic books?

19:24.337 --> 19:26.328
Yes, ma'am.

19:28.777 --> 19:33.248
- Excuse the mess.
- It's what I'd expect.

19:33.337 --> 19:37.967
- Did you know Jazmin Burgess?
- Sure. We had lunch a few times.

19:38.017 --> 19:40.975
She called here four times
the night she was attacked.

19:41.017 --> 19:45.329
I didn't answer the phone.
There were 200 people at this party.

19:45.377 --> 19:47.527
- What kind of party?
- You know.

19:47.577 --> 19:51.092
Where the literati and glitterati
size each other up

19:51.137 --> 19:54.812
over cosmopolitans and sashimi.
It was for my new novel.

19:54.857 --> 19:59.772
Benetton Requiem? I read the review
in The Times. Did Jazmin show up?

19:59.817 --> 20:02.285
Er, yeah. Yeah. Pretty late.

20:02.817 --> 20:06.412
She was a mess. I was more of a mess.
She didn't stay long.

20:06.457 --> 20:10.450
I never read reviews
but that reviewer's had it in for me

20:10.497 --> 20:13.694
since she decided one of
my characters was based on her.

20:13.737 --> 20:16.968
The book reviewer in Manhattan Siesta?
No resemblance.

20:17.017 --> 20:19.531
It's, er, Manhattan Sonata.

20:19.577 --> 20:21.010
Siesta as in 'snooze fest'.

20:21.057 --> 20:25.767
The question is how reviewers
fail to notice your theft of Joan Didion.

20:25.817 --> 20:28.809
- Joan Didion is a close friend.
- The poor woman.

20:35.657 --> 20:37.454
So, er,

20:37.497 --> 20:41.012
maybe Jazmin comes to your party
to score some crank.

20:41.057 --> 20:43.446
- Is that a possibility?
- Very possible.

20:43.497 --> 20:45.965
I met her last spring.
She had an appointment.

20:46.017 --> 20:48.577
First floor two floors are
doctors and shrinks.

20:48.617 --> 20:51.848
Did you invite any of these doctors
to the party?

20:51.897 --> 20:53.774
They just show up.

20:53.817 --> 20:56.615
If you have girls,
you don't have to invite anybody.

20:56.657 --> 20:58.648
Sex appeal's the best draw.

20:58.697 --> 21:00.972
Call me if you think of anything else.

21:01.977 --> 21:05.492
'No resemblance'
because I failed to capture her

21:05.537 --> 21:09.849
or 'no resemblance'
because it was a different character?

21:09.897 --> 21:11.774
Both.

21:12.817 --> 21:14.773
Both.

21:14.817 --> 21:17.092
OK, yeah, do it with the finger.

21:17.137 --> 21:19.731
You naughty, naughty girl.

21:19.777 --> 21:23.770
You naughty, naughty girls.
Lovely. Now touch each other.

21:23.817 --> 21:24.886
Detectives...

21:24.937 --> 21:27.974
We need to talk to Carlo
about Vanessa Wong.

21:28.017 --> 21:30.815
- Why? What happened to Vanessa?
- Someone killed her.

21:30.857 --> 21:32.848
Oh, my God!

21:32.897 --> 21:35.286
Hands up if you want a margarita.

21:35.337 --> 21:37.532
- Carlo!
- What are you doing?

21:37.577 --> 21:39.533
Oh, great.

21:39.577 --> 21:41.568
Don't sweat.

21:42.577 --> 21:46.252
- What can I do for you?
- Vanessa Wong was killed, Carlo.

21:46.297 --> 21:48.857
Oh, bollocks. Not her, as well.

21:48.897 --> 21:53.652
We found out Jazmin left
because she failed your weigh-in.

21:53.697 --> 21:55.688
Do you know why Wong went with her?

21:55.737 --> 21:58.535
Jazmin was mad at me.
Wong was her friend.

21:58.577 --> 22:01.649
- They left. I didn't pay attention.
- They went to score.

22:01.697 --> 22:05.133
- Shut it.
- Why else go to Hampton's party?

22:05.177 --> 22:08.010
That's a detail you didn't mention, Carlo.

22:08.057 --> 22:10.525
I didn't want to hurt Jazmin's family.

22:10.577 --> 22:13.091
You'll keep them from knowing that,
surely?

22:13.137 --> 22:14.968
We'll be very discreet.

22:15.017 --> 22:19.693
Here's our vic at 1:22am
on her way to Mr Trendoid's party.

22:19.737 --> 22:22.126
- Did she get the pills from him?
- Probably.

22:22.177 --> 22:25.692
The first two floors are doctors
so one of them might be hers.

22:25.737 --> 22:29.013
- We've got a list.
- She had prescription bennies.

22:29.057 --> 22:33.096
Let's find out who's writing
these prescriptions. Thanks, guys.

22:37.097 --> 22:41.295
Phen-fen, Phen-fen, Dex,
Prozac, Meridia, Phen-fen.

22:41.337 --> 22:45.808
Yeah. Dr Deke O'Connor. DBA Manhattan
Nutrition Centre. He's your guy.

22:45.857 --> 22:49.008
He's written prescriptions
for just about every diet drug.

22:49.057 --> 22:52.766
Any prescriptions to a Vanessa Wong
or a Theresa Burgess?

22:52.817 --> 22:55.047
- Can you give me a minute?
- Sure.

22:55.097 --> 22:57.088
It's Stabler. Run a name check.

22:57.137 --> 23:01.130
A Dr O'Connor. First name Deke. D-E-K-E.

23:01.177 --> 23:03.691
- 450.
- 450 Hudson Place. I'll hold.

23:03.737 --> 23:07.571
Yes, on both scores.
I got a V Wong and a T Burgess.

23:07.617 --> 23:10.370
They wouldn't happen to be narcoleptics?

23:10.417 --> 23:12.328
- No.
- No.

23:12.377 --> 23:15.813
Dr O'Connor's been giving out speed
like candy on Halloween.

23:15.857 --> 23:18.849
That the only charge? Thanks a lot.

23:18.897 --> 23:23.493
This same doctor was charged,
not convicted, in '91 on an assault rap.

23:23.537 --> 23:26.176
Beat the guy so badly
he sent him to hospital.

23:26.217 --> 23:28.208
And he's got a DUI from '94.

23:30.897 --> 23:33.491
- Dr O'Connor is over there.
- Thank you.

23:34.297 --> 23:37.289
Dr O'Connor, I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

23:37.337 --> 23:39.328
I'm Dr Sullivan.

23:39.377 --> 23:41.368
This is Dr O'Connor.

23:42.377 --> 23:45.096
He was thrown from his motorcycle
in 1997.

23:45.137 --> 23:47.128
He's one of our patients.

23:47.177 --> 23:50.533
We can rule him out for the assault charge.

23:56.737 --> 23:58.728
Doc! Have you got a second?

23:58.777 --> 24:00.972
Sure. I don't know what I can add.

24:01.017 --> 24:03.485
I think you're on the right track.

24:03.537 --> 24:08.292
The amphetamines, the starvation...
These girls are ruining their lives.

24:08.337 --> 24:11.807
Yeah. Money, power, respect...

24:11.857 --> 24:15.247
Supermodels are the Greek goddesses
of our time.

24:15.297 --> 24:18.687
That's a bunch of crap.
They're giving up their childhoods.

24:18.737 --> 24:23.208
Both these girls came from
poor backgrounds, broken families.

24:23.257 --> 24:26.249
A lot of displacement, a lot of turmoil.

24:26.297 --> 24:32.133
Let me ask you a question
about the line between dieting and anorexia,

24:32.177 --> 24:35.408
you know, for a girl who's not a model.

24:35.457 --> 24:38.335
You're not looking for a diagnostic definition.

24:40.137 --> 24:43.573
Anorexia is a way that a girl
can assert control

24:43.617 --> 24:45.608
in what can be a chaotic world.

24:45.657 --> 24:47.648
One school of thought is that

24:47.697 --> 24:51.815
these girls focus on the one area
they can control, their bodies.

24:51.857 --> 24:53.848
The more they are forced to eat,

24:53.897 --> 24:56.286
the more satisfaction they gain by refusing.

24:56.337 --> 24:59.773
- So, do you just ignore them?
- No. Never.

24:59.857 --> 25:02.894
If you see any warning signs,
self-induced vomiting,

25:02.937 --> 25:06.850
chronic headaches, use of laxitives,
then get help immediately.

25:06.897 --> 25:08.694
You sound like a warning label.

25:08.737 --> 25:11.410
All you can do is watch. Carefully.

25:13.097 --> 25:16.089
You can't always be
your daughter's best friend.

25:18.137 --> 25:20.856
Thanks, Doc. See you.

25:23.497 --> 25:26.409
- Oh, you're home.
- You're probably on her side.

25:28.617 --> 25:30.687
You look healthy enough to me.

25:30.737 --> 25:32.728
Have you eaten?

25:32.777 --> 25:34.768
No. I was waiting till you got home.

25:34.817 --> 25:37.331
Let's go to Scarentino's.

25:37.377 --> 25:40.289
Bottle of chianti. Let's get out of here.

25:41.897 --> 25:43.933
You can't make me eat Italian.

25:43.977 --> 25:46.252
You're not invited. See you.

25:47.257 --> 25:49.054
Mom!

25:53.337 --> 25:58.536
We are currently
at 6,000 prescriptions a day.

25:58.577 --> 26:01.171
We're taking the whole thing public.
Hello, IPO.

26:01.217 --> 26:04.368
Whatever happened
to the neighbourhood pharmacist?

26:04.417 --> 26:07.056
No, no! We're computerised now. Huh?

26:07.097 --> 26:10.407
Look, faster service, lower prices,
fewer errors.

26:10.457 --> 26:12.652
- It depends how you define error.
- Hm?

26:12.697 --> 26:15.291
You do a lot of business
with Dr Deke O'Connor.

26:15.337 --> 26:17.328
Yeah. Is that a problem?

26:17.377 --> 26:19.891
If problem means
he get meals intravenously

26:19.937 --> 26:21.575
and dumps in a diaper, yes.

26:21.617 --> 26:24.415
That's something a corner pharmacist
may question.

26:24.457 --> 26:26.652
Tell me what you want.

26:26.697 --> 26:28.688
O'Connor's patient list.

26:37.897 --> 26:39.888
There.

26:39.937 --> 26:42.735
And do we really need the attitude?

26:42.777 --> 26:47.805
Dozens of names, and yet the pills
were mailed to the same address.

26:47.857 --> 26:50.325
This didn't strike you as odd?

26:50.377 --> 26:53.767
Well, I guess
we need to upgrade our software.

26:53.817 --> 26:55.296
Yeah.

26:55.337 --> 26:57.055
What's up?

26:57.097 --> 27:01.648
Narcotics said you crash-landed
in a substance investigation

27:01.697 --> 27:03.688
they've been cooking on since July.

27:03.737 --> 27:07.525
We're only going after for the pills
to get to the attacker.

27:07.577 --> 27:09.966
You got pills, you tell Narcotics.

27:10.017 --> 27:13.009
Narco scouts always want
crappy possession busts.

27:13.057 --> 27:16.447
We can't do that.
Zero tolerance shuts witnesses up.

27:16.497 --> 27:18.613
I'm not saying I disagree.

27:18.657 --> 27:21.615
All the bogus prescriptions
go to the same place.

27:21.657 --> 27:24.217
Munch and Cassidy are there right now.

27:24.257 --> 27:29.047
I can buy a couple of days.
Narcotics love strategy meetings.

27:29.097 --> 27:32.533
I'll schedule one with them
and postpone it.

27:37.897 --> 27:40.172
We need to see who rents box 732.

27:41.217 --> 27:43.048
732.

27:43.097 --> 27:45.486
Yeah. 732.

27:53.497 --> 27:55.613
That'll be Bertrand Small.

27:56.617 --> 27:58.608
620, West 14th.

27:59.657 --> 28:01.773
That puts him in the Hudson River.

28:03.137 --> 28:05.207
- Who picks up his mail?
- Not a clue.

28:05.257 --> 28:09.250
We've got 1,200 boxes.
You get a key, it's got a box number on it.

28:09.297 --> 28:13.006
As long as the key matches,
account's paid, you get your mail.

28:13.057 --> 28:16.732
We'll station an officer here
till Mr 732 shows up.

28:18.697 --> 28:21.165
- Mr 732.
- Thanks a lot.

28:22.057 --> 28:24.048
Close the door, please.

28:24.097 --> 28:26.406
What's that? What is that?

28:26.457 --> 28:30.086
I didn't know that was in the envelope.
It was just a job.

28:30.137 --> 28:32.128
Keep talking. Keep talking.

28:32.177 --> 28:36.568
The more you lie, the easier it will be
to make you on a murder charge.

28:36.617 --> 28:40.246
I'm a courier. I get 100 bucks a week.

28:40.297 --> 28:42.288
L-l-l-l didn't kill anybody.

28:42.337 --> 28:45.329
- Who set this up?
- My buddy used to do this run.

28:45.377 --> 28:49.165
Then he landed the lead as
Stonewall Jackson in this Civil War drama.

28:49.217 --> 28:52.368
What do you do with the package
once you pick it up?

28:52.417 --> 28:57.172
I repackage it. The return address
says Morgan Talent Management.

28:57.217 --> 28:59.208
I deliver it to 7th and 36th.

29:00.297 --> 29:02.652
- Laszlo's building.
- Yep.

29:03.897 --> 29:06.411
It's time to bring in Narcotics.

29:06.457 --> 29:11.531
This morning you said they were
boy scouts who intimidated witnesses.

29:11.577 --> 29:15.252
That was before we uncovered
Laszlo's little sideline business.

29:15.297 --> 29:18.095
Intimidation's in order.

29:18.137 --> 29:23.575
Intimidation.
Well, you need to talk to Joey Poole.

29:23.617 --> 29:28.452
Listen up, people! New York City
Police Department. Raise your hands.

29:28.497 --> 29:31.170
What the hell are you doing?

29:31.217 --> 29:33.970
- You can't do this!
- We just did.

29:34.017 --> 29:36.212
Zoe, call Latham and Watkins now!

29:36.257 --> 29:38.976
You won't want to ride with your employees.

29:39.017 --> 29:41.451
How you transport me is not my concern.

29:41.497 --> 29:46.446
Clarification is in order.
The press is waiting for you out front.

29:46.497 --> 29:50.729
They would love a photo of Nina Laszlo,
drug dealer to the stars.

29:50.777 --> 29:55.487
If you'll talk, we can go the back
way in our car. It's up to you.

29:55.537 --> 29:57.892
- Fine.
- Good.

30:01.697 --> 30:04.530
You're at the top of your game,
got all the best talent,

30:04.577 --> 30:08.775
make a lot of money. And still
you mess around with this drug crap.

30:08.817 --> 30:12.571
- It's not for profit. Obviously.
- So it's a charity?

30:12.617 --> 30:16.849
Speed keeps the girls in trim.
It's like vitamins.

30:16.897 --> 30:20.048
You know, you are so damn cavalier.

30:20.097 --> 30:23.612
You raise a stink,
you lose them to another agency.

30:23.657 --> 30:27.093
Is that why Jazmin and Vanessa
got attacked? They raised a fuss?

30:27.137 --> 30:29.093
No.

30:32.097 --> 30:36.727
Carlo Parisi
had a private Polaroid collection.

30:36.777 --> 30:39.610
Of himself with models.

30:39.657 --> 30:41.534
Doing what?

30:42.697 --> 30:45.848
- Do I have to spell it out for you?
- Yes, you do.

30:49.497 --> 30:57.415
Jazmin said he made her... Lewinsky him.
For his collection.

30:57.457 --> 31:00.574
Then he refused to use her on the shoot.
She got pissed off.

31:00.617 --> 31:04.212
- Did you see these masterpieces?
- No.

31:04.257 --> 31:08.694
Jazmin just told me she stole them.
She stole all of them.

31:08.737 --> 31:12.127
She said she'd use them
to make sure he never worked again.

31:12.177 --> 31:14.896
Do you know what she did with them?

31:14.937 --> 31:18.168
The next thing I heard,
she was in the emergency room.

31:19.257 --> 31:23.011
You are looking at the fruits
of four hours of dumpster diving

31:23.057 --> 31:25.651
along 59th Street.
Nine dumpsters in all.

31:25.697 --> 31:27.892
The two of you went dumpster diving?

31:27.937 --> 31:31.373
Hell, no, we supervised.
I don't do disposable diapers.

31:31.417 --> 31:34.295
- How's your day?
- We're going to pick up Parisi,

31:34.337 --> 31:37.454
the photographer,
try to find his dirty pictures.

31:37.497 --> 31:41.649
Hey, Lennie. I haven't eaten in an hour.
These guys owe me lunch.

31:41.697 --> 31:44.894
I owe him nothing.
I'll supervise his doughnut withdrawal.

31:44.937 --> 31:49.931
Take Cassidy and Munch with you.
And bring me back some Bromo.

31:56.897 --> 32:00.173
- Hey! I didn't invite you in!
- Here's our invitation.

32:00.217 --> 32:03.687
Start the kiddy-porn search.
We'll ask some questions.

32:03.737 --> 32:06.092
Why don't you ask who dresses him?

32:06.137 --> 32:11.257
We know about your Polaroids
and how badly you wanted them back.

32:11.297 --> 32:14.334
I have thousands of Polaroids.
I'm a photographer.

32:14.377 --> 32:16.288
And Larry Flint's a publisher.

32:16.337 --> 32:19.295
- You can't do that!
- Uh, uh, uh.

32:19.337 --> 32:24.331
Come here. Stand over here.
Come on. Let's try this out.

32:24.377 --> 32:28.893
Jazmin steals your dirty pictures.
This is bad, I understand that.

32:28.937 --> 32:33.294
It could ruin your career, land you in jail.
So you find where she goes.

32:33.337 --> 32:37.046
You talk with her.
She's not going to give the photos back.

32:37.097 --> 32:39.657
- Things get carried away.
- All right. Go on.

32:39.697 --> 32:41.688
You got your search warrant.

32:41.737 --> 32:44.490
If you find anything like that, I'd love to see it.

32:44.537 --> 32:47.097
- I bet you would.
- I didn't murder anyone.

32:47.137 --> 32:51.653
How about statutory rape?
You made Jazmin sit for her oral exams.

32:51.697 --> 32:55.485
- That's ridiculous!
- Then a blood sample will clear you.

32:56.297 --> 32:57.525
Blood sample?

32:57.577 --> 33:01.172
There's a semen stain on Jazmin's dress.
That wasn't yours?

33:01.217 --> 33:04.414
That was a consensual act.

33:04.457 --> 33:08.416
No, no, no. It's using power to hire
and fire, to exact sexual favours

33:08.457 --> 33:11.813
and pornographic photos from a minor.

33:12.817 --> 33:14.296
Not consensual.

33:14.337 --> 33:17.773
So, Mr Parisi, would you mind
turning around, please?

33:17.817 --> 33:22.971
- Guys, take Carlo down to the unit.
- Let's go, handsome.

33:23.017 --> 33:25.850
$41,000 for a party?
That should be a crime.

33:25.897 --> 33:27.489
No, no. Down in the corner.

33:27.537 --> 33:30.688
- Deborah Latrell's signature.
- So she does book-keeping.

33:30.737 --> 33:33.695
This is their business licence.
Both names are on it.

33:33.737 --> 33:36.171
OK. Weird. Not kiddy porn.

33:38.697 --> 33:41.291
OK, so where does he hide
his dirty pictures?

33:41.337 --> 33:44.454
Three choices.
Under the bed, in back of the closet,

33:44.497 --> 33:46.294
or amongst boring papers.

33:46.337 --> 33:49.170
- I take it that's another guy thing?
- Yeah.

33:53.297 --> 33:55.094
Hello!

34:02.297 --> 34:06.575
Hey, hey, hey. Look at that.
Deborah Latrell was a knockout.

34:08.016 --> 34:12.295
That's an engagement ring.
That's an engagement party.

34:14.097 --> 34:17.089
Why would you hide something like that?

34:17.137 --> 34:19.411
Because he stood her up.

34:21.496 --> 34:23.647
But she still co-owns the business.

34:23.697 --> 34:26.609
So how does Jazmin
hit Carlo where it hurts?

34:26.657 --> 34:31.286
Show the Polaroids to his ex-fiancée,
who is now his business partner.

34:33.697 --> 34:38.293
Deborah, we have some problems
with what you told us about Monday night.

34:38.337 --> 34:42.409
'Jazmin Burgess and Vanessa Wong
were at the book release party.'

34:43.697 --> 34:46.893
- What's your problem with that?
- How did you know?

34:46.937 --> 34:50.815
- I guess they mentioned it.
- Or you were there.

34:50.857 --> 34:56.887
You went there looking for them.
Trying to get Carlo's Polaroids back.

34:56.937 --> 34:59.770
- I don't know what you mean.
- Sure you do.

34:59.817 --> 35:03.287
The girls have a blackmail file on Carlo,
but won't play ball.

35:03.337 --> 35:07.330
You call Carlo, he comes,
things get out of hand.

35:07.377 --> 35:09.254
Talk while we can still help you.

35:09.297 --> 35:13.085
I've enjoyed about as much
of your help as I can take.

35:14.857 --> 35:17.325
Has she got the courage of her convictions?

35:17.377 --> 35:19.368
You get anything off Parisi?

35:19.417 --> 35:23.296
Lies, half-truths and a story about
Cindy Crawford. How was Deborah?

35:23.337 --> 35:25.487
Munch, do us a favour.

35:26.697 --> 35:29.211
Get Parisi to sit in this chair.

35:29.257 --> 35:33.170
- Suggest Deborah rolled on him.
- Cute. The prisoner's dilemma.

35:33.217 --> 35:36.050
- What's that?
- Each thinks the other confessed.

35:36.097 --> 35:39.487
I love this job. I'll get Parisi.

35:40.497 --> 35:44.649
OK, we're pretty much done here.
We have to fingerprint and book you.

35:44.697 --> 35:47.655
- What? Why?
- Stand. Thank you.

35:47.697 --> 35:50.894
- What happened?
- We have another witness.

35:54.537 --> 35:57.529
- Here's your buddy.
- Bastard!

35:58.537 --> 36:02.974
- Couldn't keep your mouth shut!
- You couldn't keep your pants zipped!

36:10.497 --> 36:14.251
Deborah. We have his side of the story.
We want to hear yours.

36:14.297 --> 36:17.892
You know he was before I met him?
Carl Parsley!

36:17.937 --> 36:21.088
He photographed stereos
for electronic store ads.

36:21.137 --> 36:23.605
- Sit down.
- And I fell for him.

36:23.657 --> 36:26.694
I was big then, too. Cosmo, Glamour, Elle.

36:26.737 --> 36:29.809
I'd say,
'You want me, you gotta hire Carlo.'

36:29.857 --> 36:33.611
- You really gave him his start.
- Yes. Beauty is power.

36:33.657 --> 36:37.286
Until you lose it, then you're garbage,
nobody gives a damn.

36:37.337 --> 36:40.932
You wouldn't understand
because you're still beautiful.

36:40.977 --> 36:45.129
You don't know the doors that opens
until they're slammed in your face.

36:50.897 --> 36:54.094
- The Measuring Man.
- Yeah.

36:54.137 --> 36:56.207
But what happened after was worse.

36:56.257 --> 36:59.135
People stop calling you. Friends shun you.

36:59.177 --> 37:05.093
Nobody calls. But I still had Carlo.
Least I thought I did.

37:05.137 --> 37:08.493
So Jazmin and Vanessa
found you where? At Trill's party?

37:08.537 --> 37:11.734
- Yes.
- And they had the photos with them?

37:11.777 --> 37:14.575
She said she had them nearby.

37:14.617 --> 37:17.689
I don't believe her.
I don't believe Carlo would do that.

37:17.737 --> 37:23.095
But you're curious enough to look, so what?
You meet them in your car?

37:23.137 --> 37:26.686
- Then they show you the photos?
- Far worse than I feared.

37:26.737 --> 37:29.695
There's a lot of girls. A lot of girls.

37:29.737 --> 37:34.128
Beautiful women. Women I've known
for years. Women that I trusted.

37:34.177 --> 37:36.088
Betraying you with your fiancé.

37:39.097 --> 37:42.692
I don't remember what happened after that.

37:48.177 --> 37:50.771
This is your chance to tell us, Deborah.

37:57.897 --> 38:01.333
She fails one weigh-in,
and that little bitch takes away

38:01.377 --> 38:04.210
the last shred of dignity that I have.

38:05.097 --> 38:08.567
I was livid. I was cranked up on speed.

38:10.497 --> 38:13.694
I reached below the seat
just to take hold of it.

38:13.737 --> 38:16.331
For security, that's why I carry it.

38:19.097 --> 38:23.329
Hammer makes this awful cracking
sound when it hits Jazmin's teeth.

38:23.377 --> 38:26.289
And then there's this dead silence.

38:27.497 --> 38:30.295
And then the Chinese girl
started screaming.

38:30.337 --> 38:32.487
I swung at her to shut up.

38:36.297 --> 38:41.291
And then she just starts convulsing
like this... like this epileptic.

38:41.897 --> 38:43.933
Jazmin was sexually abused.

38:43.977 --> 38:46.650
That was later. It was Carlo's idea.

38:46.697 --> 38:49.973
- So you brought Carlo into this?
- Yeah.

38:51.017 --> 38:54.976
Because Carlo's very level-headed.

38:55.017 --> 38:58.487
Carlo always knows what to do.

39:02.297 --> 39:06.688
And the hammer...
Carlo said it should look like rape.

39:09.697 --> 39:11.335
It was horrible.

39:17.497 --> 39:22.287
We took her to hospital.
That dead girl, he did something with her.

39:22.337 --> 39:25.295
I don't know... I stayed in the car.

39:26.097 --> 39:31.490
Deborah. Why did you call him?
After the photos, after the betrayal.

39:31.537 --> 39:33.687
Don't you get it?

39:34.897 --> 39:37.092
Don't you get it?

39:38.297 --> 39:40.686
He was all I had.

39:55.497 --> 39:58.887
But you can never
turn back the clock, can you?

40:07.497 --> 40:09.886
Hey, Munch, any word on Jazmin?

40:09.937 --> 40:13.486
Yeah, hospital just called.
She didn't make it.
