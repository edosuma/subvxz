dispatcher as gorgeous as you.

13:25.672 --> 13:30.143

bad yourself, fireman.

this without you,

13:35.748 --> 13:36.917
you know that right?

13:48.261 --> 13:50.030
What are your plans
for the day?

13:51.164 --> 13:53.533
- I was thinking I might
clean up the bass boat.

13:54.734 --> 13:57.037
- That's ambitious.

13:57.337 --> 14:00.740
- Yeah, it'll take my
mind of fire trucks.

14:00.773 --> 14:02.809
It's been in the
shed since pops died,

14:02.842 --> 14:04.111
I thought I might use it.

14:06.113 --> 14:07.347
Maybe I'll sell it.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.183
- Hmm.

14:15.422 --> 14:17.224
Good luck with that.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.159
Well we wouldn't have
to move the cars around

14:19.192 --> 14:22.329
in the morning so I could
actually get out of the driveway.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.196
Love you.

14:42.282 --> 14:43.917
- Time to clean
up our boat pops.

16:10.370 --> 16:11.538
Miss you pops.

16:22.215 --> 16:23.216
Oh that hat.

17:13.766 --> 17:15.702
What's happening to me?

17:38.558 --> 17:39.392
- Open.

17:42.295 --> 17:43.430
Deep breaths.

17:47.934 --> 17:51.504
Until recently nobody
knew what PTSD was.

17:52.004 --> 17:53.473
- Well a lot of guys
at the department

17:53.506 --> 17:54.907
have had the same symptoms.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.043
- I don't want to label you,

17:57.076 --> 18:00.513
so let's just try some
medication at first.

18:02.449 --> 18:03.283
- Like what?

18:04.317 --> 18:07.120
- An SSRI, something
to help stabilize you

18:07.154 --> 18:11.324
for six months or so, then
we'll see what that does.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.994
- I've got four
months saved up right.

18:15.027 --> 18:15.862
- Yeah.

18:18.498 --> 18:19.766
- I want to take it all now.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.305
- Well that's your prerogative.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.774
- And when I come
back on January one,

18:28.675 --> 18:32.479
I'll have made my 20 years.

18:34.314 --> 18:35.815
- You're thinking of retiring?

18:37.717 --> 18:38.851
- If I said I wasn't

18:41.288 --> 18:42.088
I'd be lying.

18:42.121 --> 18:42.822
- Mark,

18:47.059 --> 18:50.697
it's your time,
you've earned it.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.168
See you the first of the year.

19:01.073 --> 19:01.908
- Thanks Chief.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.212

19:43.350 --> 19:44.183

19:45.252 --> 19:46.719

19:47.587 --> 19:49.689
Sorry, I didn't.

19:52.091 --> 19:54.294
- Got it, alright.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.298
Looks good.

19:59.466 --> 20:01.401
You going to the
hardware store.

20:01.434 --> 20:02.435
- Yeah, you got it.

20:02.469 --> 20:04.237
- I don't know, I
thought I had it,

20:04.271 --> 20:05.872
I gave it to you
but I can't see it.

20:05.905 --> 20:07.474
Looks really good babe.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.242
- Yeah, it's
not gonna stay.

20:09.376 --> 20:11.711
- Alright, looks great.

20:12.445 --> 20:13.680
Are you high fiveing me?

20:13.713 --> 20:15.448
- No.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.002
- What is it, what is it?

21:44.404 --> 21:46.005
This pen is real,
this pen is real.

21:47.073 --> 21:48.341

22:24.176 --> 22:26.879
- Yeah okay, yep.

24:45.852 --> 24:47.987
He was just a little boy,

24:51.824 --> 24:54.060
why would God allow
that to happen?

25:09.341 --> 25:10.577
Why are you still up?

25:10.610 --> 25:11.611
- I couldn't sleep.

25:18.885 --> 25:20.352

is have you prayed about it?

- The truth.

28:27.874 --> 28:29.208
Not sure I know how.

28:31.710 --> 28:35.081

a conversation with God.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.563
- Wish I could pack away
my strange dreams too.

29:07.646 --> 29:08.614

29:15.421 --> 29:17.756

you going somewhere?

29:17.790 --> 29:21.961

my 20, I'm hanging it up.

29:25.264 --> 29:26.665

29:26.698 --> 29:28.634
the boys and I could have
threw you a party or something.

29:29.468 --> 29:32.304

29:34.440 --> 29:35.875
I just don't like goodbyes.

29:40.679 --> 29:41.513
Alright.

29:42.849 --> 29:46.218
- It's been good, you
take care of yourself.

30:05.804 --> 30:08.040
- I see you cleaned
out your locker.

30:10.576 --> 30:11.577
- I'm done at 20.

30:14.380 --> 30:16.315
I'm totally and
completely burned out.

30:18.550 --> 30:21.387
- Mark there's a big
difference between

30:21.420 --> 30:24.256
a 20 year pension and
a 25 year pension.

30:25.892 --> 30:27.559
- Money won't
matter if I'm dead.

30:29.428 --> 30:32.764
I can't function at home,
Chief,

30:33.665 --> 30:35.634
I can't even hold
my hand straight.

30:35.667 --> 30:38.938
Listen I'm done.

30:40.672 --> 30:44.510
- Mark, what if I made it
a little easier for yah.

30:44.543 --> 30:46.678
What if I made you
a roving lieutenant,

30:46.712 --> 30:48.647
you could go from
station to station,

30:48.680 --> 30:49.916
making sure that they --

30:49.949 --> 30:53.152
- Chief I'm grateful but
I've made my decision.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.321
Listen I can't explain
it, I just feel like

30:55.354 --> 30:57.456
God's telling me to do
something different.

30:59.058 --> 31:00.726
- Mark I know you're
a man of faith

31:02.194 --> 31:03.529
- It's a big decision.

31:05.898 --> 31:07.833
- Have you prayed on it?

31:07.866 --> 31:09.335
- To tell you the truth Chief,

31:09.368 --> 31:11.837
it's been a long
time since I prayed.

31:11.870 --> 31:12.871
Kind of forgot how.

31:14.706 --> 31:19.678
- Mark, prayer is the
strongest, most powerful tool

31:19.711 --> 31:21.413
you've got.

31:23.549 --> 31:25.284
All you've gotta
do is talk to him.

31:27.753 --> 31:28.587
- Yeah I know.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.067
- I'll be praying for you.

31:58.450 --> 31:59.318
- Thank you.

32:00.186 --> 32:00.953
- Yeah.

32:06.692 --> 32:07.526
Hey.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.432
- You're turning soft
on me huh.

32:14.800 --> 32:15.634
Chief.

32:41.994 --> 32:43.562
- How does it feel?

32:47.733 --> 32:51.070
- A little scary but
I think it's right.

- I'm all ears.

36:24.450 --> 36:26.184
- This was the
craziest dream yet.

36:29.255 --> 36:30.389
- What time was this?

36:32.291 --> 36:36.194
- I don't know,
around 1:30-ish.

36:39.265 --> 36:40.866
- You were sleeping
like a rock.

36:47.406 --> 36:49.107
- In my work I've
seen everything.

36:53.211 --> 36:57.449
But what I saw last
night scared me so much

36:57.483 --> 37:00.752
all I could do was
lay there, paralyzed.

37:07.393 --> 37:08.894
- Your voice sounds different.

37:10.396 --> 37:11.229
- Different how?

37:14.300 --> 37:17.235
- It's deeper, more resonant.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.106
Authoritative.

37:23.409 --> 37:24.343
- I hadn't noticed.

37:28.947 --> 37:30.349
Maybe I should sing bass.

37:34.786 --> 37:37.756
- Maybe we need
a second opinion.

37:45.464 --> 37:46.298
- I don't know.

37:52.538 --> 37:53.372
Maybe.

38:05.817 --> 38:06.652
- Mark.

38:09.054 --> 38:10.456
Have a seat.

38:17.363 --> 38:19.865
We got your tests results
back quicker then usual.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.135
- Go ahead I can take it.

38:25.804 --> 38:29.007
- Mark, this isn't
all in your head.

38:29.040 --> 38:31.510
You have an extremely
low thyroid,

38:31.543 --> 38:33.211
you have severe
adrenal burnout,

38:34.380 --> 38:36.348
you have the hormones
of a 70 year old.

38:37.716 --> 38:39.351
With numbers like
yours I..

38:40.151 --> 38:41.520
I don't know how you're
getting out of bed.

38:41.853 --> 38:44.490
- I'm not, most of the time.

38:45.424 --> 38:47.793
- I want to work on a plan
to restore your health,

38:47.826 --> 38:51.497
physically, mentally
and spiritually.

38:52.731 --> 38:54.332
This is not an overnight fix.

38:56.735 --> 38:59.270
- Well, got all the
time in the world.

39:01.607 --> 39:05.176
- Tell me something, how
did you cope with the daily

39:06.445 --> 39:08.279
rigors of being a firefighter?

39:14.586 --> 39:17.856
It's okay, you came
to us for help,

39:19.391 --> 39:20.592
this is where it begins.

39:22.060 --> 39:25.597
- My job as a fireman
was to react calmly

39:26.865 --> 39:28.366
using rescue protocol.

39:29.801 --> 39:32.938
When I click into
survival mode it means

39:32.971 --> 39:34.873
building up a wall
around my emotions.

39:36.942 --> 39:37.776
- I can see that.

39:38.977 --> 39:40.746
- Dealing with death
and injury every day

39:40.779 --> 39:44.282
and running toward
danger constantly,

39:45.551 --> 39:47.686
I don't have time
to think about it.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.888
You can't afford to
have feelings about it,

39:50.989 --> 39:52.524
it'll get you killed.

39:52.558 --> 39:54.225
- That's a pretty
heavy burden to bear.

39:55.627 --> 39:56.928
- That's what we
were trained to do.

39:56.962 --> 39:59.297
- But still you
have the emotions.

39:59.330 --> 40:02.067
I mean the trauma
happens, unfortunately

40:02.100 --> 40:04.102
how we cope with it
can become the prison

40:04.135 --> 40:05.270
that we get stuck in.

40:08.273 --> 40:09.541
- What do I do?

40:09.575 --> 40:12.778
- Well that's where
God's grace comes in.

40:12.811 --> 40:15.280
His doing what we're
not able to do.

40:16.782 --> 40:18.450
Tuning into his voice will help

40:18.484 --> 40:20.586
quiet what's raging
inside of you.

40:42.373 --> 40:44.409
Eventually it'll age,

40:44.442 --> 40:46.912
it'll sag and it'll wrinkle.

40:46.945 --> 40:50.682
There are five key things
that age your skin,

40:50.716 --> 40:53.318
number one is
excessive sunlight.

42:14.199 --> 42:16.067
- You cannot keep
living like this.

42:18.704 --> 42:19.537
- I know.

42:22.373 --> 42:25.543
I don't want to keep living if
this is how it's going to be.

42:51.770 --> 42:52.604
- Mark!

42:53.972 --> 42:55.306
Mark!

42:55.573 --> 42:58.143
Mark, wake up!

42:58.243 --> 43:00.612
- Eeee-Ahh-Shea

43:00.646 --> 43:01.479
- Mark!

43:02.080 --> 43:03.081
- Eeee-Ahh-Shea

43:03.181 --> 43:03.982
- Wake up!

43:06.685 --> 43:08.019
- Lord, help us.

43:16.127 --> 43:17.362
What was it?

43:17.663 --> 43:19.597
- Something had a
hold of my throat,

43:20.866 --> 43:22.668
it was choking me.

43:24.535 --> 43:26.037
- What were you trying to say?

43:28.006 --> 43:28.807
- Jesus.

43:31.376 --> 43:33.278
It was trying to take my voice.

43:39.217 --> 43:42.020
- We're gonna get
through this, we will.

43:50.495 --> 43:51.830
- I love you.

43:52.363 --> 43:53.331
- I love you too.

43:58.670 --> 44:00.806
- Another wild
dream this morning.

44:02.507 --> 44:04.142
Is this what PTSD is all about?

44:17.689 --> 44:20.158
- Lord I know that
you can hear me

44:21.592 --> 44:25.096
and I am, I am begging you.

44:26.664 --> 44:28.666
Lord please I cannot
do this alone.

44:32.670 --> 44:34.439
I need you to heal him.

44:41.780 --> 44:42.781
Lord please.

45:04.435 --> 45:05.270
- Come on.

45:07.372 --> 45:08.206
Come on!

45:10.408 --> 45:12.243
I'm not afraid of you.

45:26.324 --> 45:30.328
I woke up on the floor, flat
on my back in a cold sweat.

45:32.230 --> 45:33.731
I think I saw God.

45:39.070 --> 45:41.572
Lord says this to
Cyrus, his anointed.

45:41.606 --> 45:44.742
who's right hand I have grasped
to subdue nations before.

45:46.011 --> 45:49.447
To disarm kings, to open
the doors before him,

45:49.480 --> 45:52.283
and the gates will not be shut.

45:52.818 --> 45:55.887
I will go before you and
level the uneven places.

45:55.921 --> 45:57.388
I will shatter the bronze doors

45:57.422 --> 45:59.290
and cut the iron bars in two.

46:09.100 --> 46:12.003
- The
fact is money is being

46:12.037 --> 46:15.740
drained out of this country
at an alarming rate.

46:15.773 --> 46:18.944
350 billion this year
from China, alone.

46:18.977 --> 46:21.913
Four billion from

46:23.281 --> 46:25.650
Every country they
all make good deals.

46:25.683 --> 46:28.920
I'm concerned that we're
going to go over the abyss.

46:28.954 --> 46:30.488
We have incompetent leadership,

46:31.156 --> 46:33.324
we have people who
have no clue,

46:33.358 --> 46:34.860
either that or
they're very evil.

46:34.893 --> 46:37.095
I don't think they're evil
I think they have no clue.

46:37.128 --> 46:45.036
- God said "you're hearing
the voice of a President."

46:49.340 --> 46:50.575
"President Trump."

47:09.327 --> 47:18.703
Spirit of God told me
of your chosen this man

47:22.607 --> 47:26.411
Donald Trump for
such a time as this.

47:30.215 --> 47:37.055
For as Benjamin
Netanyahu is to Israel.

47:40.191 --> 47:46.131
So shall this man be to the
United States of America.

48:00.111 --> 48:02.914
- This is intriguing,
I don't know

48:02.948 --> 48:04.282
what to think of it either.

48:07.452 --> 48:11.256
Mark I want to refer you
to one of my colleagues.

48:11.289 --> 48:14.892
Dr Don Colbert, as you
know I'll be closing

48:14.926 --> 48:17.195
my practice soon and I'll
be taking a new position

48:17.228 --> 48:20.365
at the hospital, he's
had some noted success

48:20.398 --> 48:22.400
treating patients with PTSD.

48:24.069 --> 48:27.772
- Well thanks Dr Vander, for
everything you've done for me.

48:29.074 --> 48:30.608
- You're a very special person,

48:31.776 --> 48:34.645
and I'm not sure how
to make sense of what

48:34.679 --> 48:36.081
all's happening with you.

48:36.982 --> 48:39.917
But I get the impression
that God is doing something.

48:44.822 --> 48:45.656
- Thank you.

48:54.599 --> 48:55.433
- Mark Taylor.

48:58.436 --> 48:59.770
Right this way Mr. Taylor.

49:06.277 --> 49:08.346
- Hey Mark, thank you Carla.

49:08.379 --> 49:09.214
Come on in.

49:11.382 --> 49:13.284
I've read your charts
from Dr. Vander,

49:14.452 --> 49:16.487
and reviewed the tests
we ran last week.

49:18.023 --> 49:20.725
- Looks like there are
several things going on here.

49:23.228 --> 49:24.629
- We'll I've read your book,

49:25.696 --> 49:28.466
I don't think this is all
diet, exercise and water.

49:30.468 --> 49:34.005
- Well not entirely
but it's a key factor

49:34.039 --> 49:36.341
during the initial
stages of the treatment

49:36.374 --> 49:38.976
of the route causes of PTSD.

49:40.345 --> 49:44.115
When you finish this
program I think you'll

49:44.149 --> 49:45.083
be a different man.

49:49.654 --> 49:50.888
- I, uhh

49:53.691 --> 49:55.326
I have very graphic dreams.

49:56.327 --> 49:58.663
- I've read about that
in Dr. Vander's report.

49:59.497 --> 50:01.366
What kind of dreams?

50:01.399 --> 50:05.503
- A lot of nightmares,
where I'm struggling

50:06.671 --> 50:07.505
and fighting.

50:09.407 --> 50:10.908
- That's interesting.

50:12.910 --> 50:13.744
- Yeah.

50:17.915 --> 50:21.219
Sometimes I have
good ones where I get

50:21.252 --> 50:23.088
a visit from an angel.

50:24.255 --> 50:27.292
- Hmm, they ever say anything?

50:30.428 --> 50:32.763
- You don't think that's crazy?

50:32.797 --> 50:36.367
- No, dreams are important.

50:36.401 --> 50:40.338
They can give us a window
to what's going on inside.

50:40.371 --> 50:43.007
Not all of them but
most have some kind

50:43.040 --> 50:45.376
of insight to give us.

50:45.410 --> 50:50.381
- Sometimes I think that
God's talking to me.

50:54.652 --> 50:58.523
- Hey, how'd it go
with Dr. Colbert?

50:58.556 --> 51:00.691
- I like him, yeah
he ran some tests

51:00.725 --> 51:03.628
and I'm gonna go back
next week for a follow up.

51:03.661 --> 51:06.030
- Did he have any
initial thoughts?

51:06.063 --> 51:08.566
- He wants me to drink a
boat load of filtered water.

51:11.402 --> 51:14.172
- That's it, drink water.

51:16.974 --> 51:17.808
- Yeah.

51:20.278 --> 51:21.112
- Huh.

51:28.119 --> 51:29.587
- It's okay.

51:32.457 --> 51:33.291
It's okay.

51:56.881 --> 51:59.016
- David Rubey
CBN News in Boston

51:59.049 --> 52:01.018
at Romney headquarters.

52:01.051 --> 52:04.755
Mitt Romney got closer then
John McCain did four years ago

52:04.789 --> 52:05.756
- Thanks.

52:05.790 --> 52:07.858
- But clearly
the anti-Obama vote

52:07.892 --> 52:10.161
was just not enough and
now there'll be questions

52:10.195 --> 52:12.663
as to whether or not
Mitt Romney was really

52:12.697 --> 52:14.131
the right candidate all along.

52:14.499 --> 52:18.436
- I don't get it, how
can any of this be real.

52:18.469 --> 52:20.037
The man never even
tried to run.

52:21.071 --> 52:22.807
- Trump was never
taken seriously.

52:23.841 --> 52:29.314
Maybe it is real, but it's
just not what you think it is.

52:32.149 --> 52:34.118
- I'll tell you what I think,

52:34.151 --> 52:35.920
I think I'm going
completely crazy.

52:39.990 --> 52:41.692
- Why don't you let
Dr. Colbert take a look

52:41.726 --> 52:43.328
at your journal.

52:43.361 --> 52:45.863
- When the time's
right maybe I will.

52:53.271 --> 52:58.543
- I am officially
running for President

52:58.576 --> 53:03.481
of the United States
and we are going to make

53:03.514 --> 53:05.550
our country great again.

53:19.430 --> 53:20.698
- I've always kept a journal.

53:23.100 --> 53:24.101
- Can I have a look?

53:29.540 --> 53:30.641
- Let me see.

53:38.215 --> 53:40.117
I got this one in 2011.

53:43.888 --> 53:45.155
It's kind of strange huh?

53:57.402 --> 53:59.904
- Do you mind if my
wife has a look at this?

54:03.007 --> 54:06.444
- I actually printed
off a copy for yah.

54:11.482 --> 54:13.884
- She's a keen sense
for interpreting

54:13.918 --> 54:15.019
things like this.

54:16.287 --> 54:18.088
- Yes I'll put her on the schedule tomorrow.

54:18.122 --> 54:19.156
Let me call you back.

54:19.424 --> 54:21.459
- Honey step
into my office please.

54:21.492 --> 54:22.327
- I'll be right in.

54:25.596 --> 54:28.566
- Mary this is Mark
Taylor, he's a new patient.

54:28.599 --> 54:30.000
Mark, meet my wife Mary.

54:30.935 --> 54:32.269
- Nice to meet you Mark.

54:32.303 --> 54:33.137
- You too.

54:34.171 --> 54:37.274
- Mark copied this
from his journal,

54:37.308 --> 54:39.209
I'd like for you to
take a look at it.

54:44.982 --> 54:47.385
- The Command-in-Chief
Prophecy.

54:49.019 --> 54:50.788
- I told him it was
kind of strange.

54:52.823 --> 54:56.627
- The interesting thing is
he got that in April 2011.

54:58.128 --> 55:01.699
- Hmm, I'll take a look at it.

55:07.405 --> 55:11.141
- April 28th 2011,
Commander-in-Chief.

55:12.176 --> 55:15.446
The spirit of God says
I have chosen this man,

55:15.480 --> 55:18.849
Donald Trump for
such a time as this.

55:18.883 --> 55:21.986

♪ A sudden change leads
me to your grace ♪

55:47.678 --> 55:49.013
- Mind if I come in.

55:49.046 --> 55:50.214
- Come in.
- Sure.

55:52.450 --> 55:55.453
- Mark, this is good.

55:56.120 --> 55:57.221
- You think so.

55:58.423 --> 56:00.858
- I do, it has that rhythm
to it when the Holy Spirit

56:00.891 --> 56:03.260
is bearing witness
to the truth.

56:03.293 --> 56:04.762
At least it does to me.

56:07.197 --> 56:09.967
I think you have to let the
whole world know about this.

56:15.372 --> 56:20.377
- What's so strange to me
is that I got this in 2011,

56:21.045 --> 56:24.449
and it felt so
distinct and real.

56:26.717 --> 56:28.285
Trump didn't even run.

56:30.788 --> 56:32.056
- And that was four years ago.

56:38.796 --> 56:41.632
- Well, all I know is
that it has that rhythm

56:41.666 --> 56:44.502
of truth to it, at
least it does to me.

56:47.004 --> 56:49.640
You know, I think God
is up to something.

56:50.975 --> 56:53.811
Hey, how about we pray.

56:58.082 --> 57:02.720
Heavenly Father, we thank
you for this message of hope

57:02.753 --> 57:05.422
and we know you have a plan
because you are in control

57:05.456 --> 57:09.894
of everything, Father we
come to you for your guidance

57:09.927 --> 57:13.564
for Mark and for us
as we seek your will.

57:13.598 --> 57:16.333
Show us your way
dear Lord

57:16.867 --> 57:17.868
Amen

58:14.925 --> 58:17.327
- Lord I need you, forgive me,

58:17.361 --> 58:19.163
I can't fight this
battle on my own.

58:21.599 --> 58:24.569
Please Lord, speak to me.

58:40.851 --> 58:42.086
Please, please.

58:47.858 --> 58:56.166
No weapon formed against me

58:56.200 --> 58:58.703
shall prosper.

59:09.614 --> 59:11.548
- Hey mom, I'm at a
conference what's up?

59:11.582 --> 59:15.285
- DJ do you remember the
Commander prophecy I sent you?

59:16.486 --> 59:18.789
- Yeah sure, what about it?

59:18.823 --> 59:20.557
- I felt the Holy Spirit saying

59:20.591 --> 59:23.628
I needed to get involved
somehow, I have no idea

59:23.661 --> 59:27.431
what that means but
somehow I think you might.

59:27.464 --> 59:29.634
- And how am I supposed
to know about this?

59:30.968 --> 59:33.437
- The Holy Spirit gave
me this distinct sense

59:33.470 --> 59:37.407
that I should call you and
you would know what to do.

59:37.441 --> 59:38.475
So I called.

59:43.413 --> 59:46.050
DJ, are you still there?

59:46.083 --> 59:47.451
- Mom, let me call you back.

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:03.834
- Mom, I just
got an idea.

01:00:03.868 --> 01:00:05.102
- Yeah?

01:00:05.135 --> 01:00:07.437
- Go to Second
Chronicles seven, 14.

01:00:07.471 --> 01:00:08.305
Read that to me.

01:00:09.506 --> 01:00:10.340
- Okay.

01:00:11.976 --> 01:00:14.578
Second Chronicles,
Second Chronicles.

01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:17.982
If my people, which
are called by my name,

01:00:18.015 --> 01:00:21.185
shall humble
themselves and pray,

01:00:21.218 --> 01:00:22.653
and seek my face,

01:00:22.687 --> 01:00:25.189
and turn from their
wicked ways,

01:00:25.222 --> 01:00:27.324
then will I hear from Heaven,

01:00:27.357 --> 01:00:29.426
and will forgive their sin,

01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:31.328
and will heal their land.

01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:34.198
- There's your answer.

01:00:35.365 --> 01:00:36.300
- So?

01:00:36.333 --> 01:00:38.435
- This is a call to prayer.

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:41.138
You need to start a
national prayer chain.

01:00:41.171 --> 01:00:42.506
- What?

01:00:42.539 --> 01:00:43.774
- You're gonna talk
to all the ministries,

01:00:43.808 --> 01:00:44.709
and all the leaders you know,

01:00:44.742 --> 01:00:46.176
and mobilize them for prayer.

01:00:47.077 --> 01:00:48.645
- But D.J..

01:00:48.679 --> 01:00:49.613
- No buts.

01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:51.148
You know all kinds of people.

01:00:51.181 --> 01:00:53.217
God is telling us to
pray for our country.

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:56.453
Its leadership and those
in authority over us.

01:00:56.486 --> 01:00:57.922
That's what we need to do.

01:01:01.525 --> 01:01:02.860
- Oh my goodness.

01:01:03.694 --> 01:01:05.896
- Start praying every day.

01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:07.832
On a conference call-in number.

01:01:07.865 --> 01:01:10.835
Everybody agreeing for the
will of God to be done.

01:01:10.868 --> 01:01:12.536
For his intervention.

01:01:12.569 --> 01:01:13.704
For this election.

01:01:13.738 --> 01:01:15.172
- This is perfect.

01:01:15.205 --> 01:01:17.708
Okay, I gotta go, bye.

01:01:17.742 --> 01:01:19.143
- Mom, mom.

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:20.244
- Yeah?

01:01:20.277 --> 01:01:21.678
What is it, son?

01:01:21.712 --> 01:01:23.380
- Just so we're clear.

01:01:23.413 --> 01:01:25.215
I've never really
been a Trump fan.

01:01:26.851 --> 01:01:28.352
- No worries.

01:01:28.385 --> 01:01:32.723
Neither have I.

01:01:48.305 --> 01:01:49.106
- Hello?

01:01:49.139 --> 01:01:50.540
- Hey, George.

01:01:50.574 --> 01:01:52.877
- Hi Mary, what a
nice surprise.

01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:54.845
- George, are you still leading

01:01:54.879 --> 01:01:57.281
that prayer group
at your school?

01:01:57.314 --> 01:01:58.883
- Yeah, why?

01:01:58.916 --> 01:02:00.117
- Well.

01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:02.953
We need a special
prayer for Donald Trump.

01:02:02.987 --> 01:02:05.890
- You mean the billionaire
with the big orange hair?

01:02:07.324 --> 01:02:09.726
- That's him.

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.028
- Yeah.

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:12.729
I'm gonna have to get
back to you on that one.

01:02:12.763 --> 01:02:13.630
I'm in the middle of a game,

01:02:13.663 --> 01:02:14.899
and my guys are gonna kill me.

01:02:14.932 --> 01:02:17.134
Alright, I gotta go, bye.
- George.

01:02:17.501 --> 01:02:18.335
George?

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:24.408
Pastor Bob, this
is Mary Colbert.

01:02:25.342 --> 01:02:26.243
I need to talk to you about

01:02:26.276 --> 01:02:28.078
an intercessory prayer chain.

01:02:28.112 --> 01:02:29.146
- That's great.

01:02:29.179 --> 01:02:30.747
Who are you praying for?

01:02:30.781 --> 01:02:32.082
- Donald Trump.

01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:35.786
- Oh, well there's someone
who needs a lot of prayer.

01:02:37.287 --> 01:02:38.923
- Well we believe
God has chosen him

01:02:38.956 --> 01:02:41.591
to be the next President
of the United States.

01:02:45.930 --> 01:02:46.964
Pastor Bob?

01:02:59.009 --> 01:03:01.145
Hey Billie, that was fast.

01:03:01.178 --> 01:03:02.412
- Sorry, I left my
phone in the car

01:03:02.446 --> 01:03:03.247
while I was shopping.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.448
What's up?

01:03:04.481 --> 01:03:05.749
- I think the lord wants me

01:03:05.782 --> 01:03:07.784
to start a national
prayer call,

01:03:07.818 --> 01:03:09.854
and I want you to
be a part of it.

01:03:09.887 --> 01:03:11.956
- Okay, what does he
want us to pray for?

01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:15.325
- Well, not what, who.

01:03:15.659 --> 01:03:16.460
Donald Trump.

01:03:17.494 --> 01:03:19.663
To be the next President
of the United States.

01:03:19.696 --> 01:03:22.799
I'm going to call it the
Nation Builder's Prayer Call,

01:03:22.833 --> 01:03:25.035
and I'm contacting
everybody I know.

01:03:26.403 --> 01:03:28.338
- Mary, there's something
I need to tell you.

01:03:28.372 --> 01:03:31.008
I've never been a
fan of Donald Trump.

01:03:40.517 --> 01:03:41.351
- Pops.

01:03:52.229 --> 01:03:53.063
- Hello.

01:03:53.898 --> 01:03:54.698
Welcome.

01:03:54.731 --> 01:03:55.565
Need some help?

01:03:56.733 --> 01:03:58.102
- Thanks, I got it.

01:04:01.005 --> 01:04:01.906
- Ladies and gentlemen,

01:04:01.939 --> 01:04:03.507
our boarding is now complete.

01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:04.741
Please takes your seats

01:04:04.774 --> 01:04:06.176
as we prepare the
cabin for takeoff.

01:04:08.178 --> 01:04:09.313
- Hey, come on, please.

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:10.480
- Sir, are you okay?

01:04:10.514 --> 01:04:11.248
- I'm sorry.

01:04:11.281 --> 01:04:13.383
Excuse me, I'm so sorry.

01:04:13.417 --> 01:04:14.684
- Excuse me.

01:04:14.718 --> 01:04:17.054
I have a very important
phone call at 9:00 a.m.

01:04:17.087 --> 01:04:18.855
It's a national prayer call.

01:04:18.889 --> 01:04:20.090
- Okay.

01:04:20.124 --> 01:04:22.526
- I'm just gonna
go right in there.

01:04:22.559 --> 01:04:23.460
Don't be alarmed.

01:04:25.029 --> 01:04:26.030
- Wait, ma'am?

01:04:26.063 --> 01:04:27.097
We're about to take off.

01:04:27.131 --> 01:04:28.698
Ma'am.

01:04:28.732 --> 01:04:30.267
Okay, okay, I got it.

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:31.568
Thank you so much.

01:04:31.601 --> 01:04:32.702
Yeah, sit down.

01:04:32.736 --> 01:04:34.371
Yeah, I'll do it, thank you.

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:37.274
Come on.

01:04:41.478 --> 01:04:43.047
Ah.

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:44.881
- Good morning, everyone.

01:04:44.915 --> 01:04:47.617
I understand there's
thousands of us.

01:04:47.651 --> 01:04:48.919
Praise God.

01:04:49.819 --> 01:04:52.089
Father, we thank you.

01:04:52.122 --> 01:04:53.890
We praise you.

01:04:53.924 --> 01:04:55.759
You're going to do
what you said

01:04:55.792 --> 01:04:57.027
you're going to do.

01:04:57.061 --> 01:04:59.029
- Ma'am, could I get
your drink order?

01:04:59.063 --> 01:05:01.531
- What is going on
in that bathroom?

01:05:03.267 --> 01:05:05.635
Is there somebody
praying in there?

01:05:05.669 --> 01:05:06.870
- Could be, could be.

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:08.805
It wouldn't be the first time.

01:05:08.838 --> 01:05:10.874
- Well it's just so loud.

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:12.109
- Okay, you know what?

01:05:12.142 --> 01:05:14.278
I'll check on it for you,
okay?

01:05:14.311 --> 01:05:15.912
Would that be alright?
- Thank you.

01:05:15.946 --> 01:05:16.780
- Alright.

01:05:18.348 --> 01:05:20.317
- Ma'am, is everything okay?
- And seek my face,

01:05:20.350 --> 01:05:22.419
and turn from their
wicked ways.

01:05:22.452 --> 01:05:24.154
- We're about to
take off pretty soon.

01:05:24.188 --> 01:05:26.256
- Then will I hear from heaven,

01:05:26.290 --> 01:05:27.757
and will forgive their sins.

01:05:27.791 --> 01:05:28.892
- You need
to get back to your seat.

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:31.928
- And will heal their land.

01:05:31.962 --> 01:05:35.599
Father, we praise
you, we thank you.

01:05:35.632 --> 01:05:36.600
- Okay.

01:05:37.834 --> 01:05:39.469
- We know you're in control.

01:05:40.637 --> 01:05:41.771
- A passenger's on
a conference call,

01:05:41.805 --> 01:05:43.107
and she'll be out soon.

01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:44.308
Now what can I get for you?

01:05:44.341 --> 01:05:46.776
- I'll have a double
Tanqueray martini.

01:05:46.810 --> 01:05:48.979
Straight up, not dirty.

01:05:49.013 --> 01:05:50.680
And three olives.

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:52.716
- Right away.

01:05:57.187 --> 01:05:58.155
- Did you get everything
taken care of in there?

01:05:58.188 --> 01:05:59.723
- Yep, we're covered.

01:06:00.224 --> 01:06:01.025
- Awesome.

01:06:01.058 --> 01:06:02.792
- Praise the lord.

01:06:02.826 --> 01:06:03.660
- Amen.

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:09.299
- Oh.

01:06:15.172 --> 01:06:16.473
Stop it.

01:06:16.506 --> 01:06:17.441
- That's great.

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:18.875
Yes, yes yes.

01:06:18.908 --> 01:06:20.144
That's wonderful.

01:06:20.177 --> 01:06:21.011
Could you hold on
just one second?

01:06:21.045 --> 01:06:22.212
Thank you.

01:06:22.246 --> 01:06:25.149
Mary, you're gonna
wanna take this call.

01:06:28.185 --> 01:06:31.155
- Hello?

01:06:31.188 --> 01:06:32.022
Yes?

01:06:33.523 --> 01:06:34.658
Absolutely.

01:06:36.193 --> 01:06:37.827
Sure.

01:06:37.861 --> 01:06:40.064
The 10th?

01:06:40.097 --> 01:06:40.930
Okay.

01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:44.134
Alright.

01:06:44.168 --> 01:06:45.369
I've got you down.

01:06:46.403 --> 01:06:48.038
Yes, thanks for calling
me back.

01:06:49.906 --> 01:06:51.308
Exactly.

01:06:51.341 --> 01:06:54.078
Well part of this prophecy,
I was for Ted Cruz.

01:06:57.781 --> 01:06:59.216
Hi, Mr. Clements, how are you?

01:06:59.249 --> 01:07:00.750
Ollie, hi.

01:07:00.784 --> 01:07:02.219
That's right.

01:07:02.252 --> 01:07:03.053
It's for real.

01:07:06.890 --> 01:07:07.691
I'll get it, I'll get it.

01:07:07.724 --> 01:07:08.925
Hello?

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:13.029
Do you know what a Shofar is?

01:07:13.063 --> 01:07:15.099
- You mean the Jewish horn?

01:07:15.132 --> 01:07:16.833
- That's right.

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:19.669
They used it as a
sound for battle,

01:07:19.703 --> 01:07:22.472
and to praise God
for the victory.

01:07:23.907 --> 01:07:26.743
I believe God wants us to
use it on election day.

01:07:26.776 --> 01:07:27.577
- Really?

01:07:27.611 --> 01:07:28.845
- Really.

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:30.380
- So you gave out our
office phone numbers

01:07:30.414 --> 01:07:32.582
so people could
call in about that?

01:07:34.084 --> 01:07:37.087
- Give me that one, and just
start over with a new list.

01:07:37.121 --> 01:07:39.223
I got it, I got it.

01:07:39.256 --> 01:07:40.390
Hi, thank you for calling.

01:07:40.424 --> 01:07:41.891
Wonderful.

01:07:41.925 --> 01:07:43.727
Oh my gosh, we're glad
to have you at this part.

01:07:46.330 --> 01:07:47.331
Okay, bye bye.

01:07:56.140 --> 01:07:58.408
This is going a lot
better than I thought.

01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:01.678
Alright, let's keep going.

01:08:03.447 --> 01:08:04.381
- Build the wall

01:08:04.414 --> 01:08:05.882
the way you built Trump Towers,

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:06.550
you'll be using illegal
immigrant labor to do it.

01:08:10.687 --> 01:08:11.955
- Mari Jo, could you come
in here for a second?

01:08:11.988 --> 01:08:13.457
You've got to see this.

01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:14.424
- It's not
a soundbite, it's a fact.

01:08:14.458 --> 01:08:15.592
Again, go online and Google it.

01:08:15.625 --> 01:08:17.493
Donald Trump Polish
workers, you'll see it.

01:08:17.527 --> 01:08:19.062
- What's this?

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:20.264
- The second
thing about the trade war,

01:08:20.296 --> 01:08:21.798
I don't understand
'cause your ties

01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:23.267
and the clothes you make is
made in Mexico and in China.

01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:24.634
So you're gonna be
starting a trade war

01:08:24.667 --> 01:08:26.136
against the wrong sides--

01:08:26.170 --> 01:08:27.437
- You know what?

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:28.837
- Why
don't you make it clear?

01:08:28.872 --> 01:08:30.307
- Devalue
their character.

01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:32.075
- Well then
make them in America.

01:08:32.108 --> 01:08:33.410
- It makes it impo--

01:08:33.443 --> 01:08:34.644
Well you don't know a
thing about business.

01:08:34.678 --> 01:08:36.011
- Well
make 'em in America.

01:08:36.045 --> 01:08:37.447
- You don't
know anything about it

01:08:37.481 --> 01:08:38.948
'cause you're a--
- Is this really possible?

01:08:38.982 --> 01:08:40.517
- It's unreal is what it is.

01:08:42.486 --> 01:08:43.287
- So I
don't know anything about,

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:44.787
you know what?

01:08:44.821 --> 01:08:46.523
You started a University,
it was a fake University.

01:08:46.555 --> 01:08:47.791
- First of
all, first of all--

01:08:47.823 --> 01:08:48.692
- That
was a fake University.

01:08:48.725 --> 01:08:49.959
- That's called--

01:08:49.993 --> 01:08:51.428
There are people--

01:08:51.461 --> 01:08:52.629
- Hold on,
one at a time, Mr. Trump.

01:08:52.662 --> 01:08:53.529
- That
borrowed 36,000 dollars

01:08:53.563 --> 01:08:54.464
to go to Trump University,

01:08:54.497 --> 01:08:55.665
and they're suing 'em now.

01:08:55.698 --> 01:09:00.002
36,000 dollars.

01:09:08.478 --> 01:09:09.578
- I'm concerned.

01:09:10.514 --> 01:09:12.048
- Okay.

01:09:12.081 --> 01:09:12.916
Let's talk.

01:09:15.752 --> 01:09:17.720
- Well, we're getting
a great response.

01:09:19.555 --> 01:09:20.790
But I'm--

01:09:22.259 --> 01:09:24.361
I'm worried at times I
could be overselling this.

01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:27.663
You know how excited I get.

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:31.268
What if I'm wrong?

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:37.207
They're going at him tooth
and claw in those debates.

01:09:38.675 --> 01:09:40.344
What if he doesn't
get confirmed

01:09:40.377 --> 01:09:41.845
at the Republican Convention?

01:09:44.214 --> 01:09:45.048
- Mary.

01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:47.384
All we can do is pray.

01:09:48.952 --> 01:09:51.488
God tells us to
pray for all men.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.258
For kings, for all
in authority.

01:09:54.291 --> 01:09:56.059
To honor and respect them.

01:09:57.427 --> 01:09:59.062
That's what he's
called us to do.

01:10:00.564 --> 01:10:04.434
If we do our Second
Chronicles seven, 14 part,

01:10:05.535 --> 01:10:06.903
he will hear from Heaven.

01:10:07.937 --> 01:10:08.872
And heal our land.

01:10:16.913 --> 01:10:18.047
- Thank you.

01:10:21.618 --> 01:10:22.452
Thank you.

01:10:24.621 --> 01:10:26.089
Lord.

01:10:26.122 --> 01:10:28.057
As we answer your call to pray,

01:10:29.559 --> 01:10:31.928
please give me a
confidence to know that

01:10:33.497 --> 01:10:35.098
we are doing your will,

01:10:36.333 --> 01:10:37.967
and not our own.

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:45.241
Hey, Mark.

01:10:45.275 --> 01:10:46.576
- Mary.

01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:48.044
- I didn't expect
to see you today.

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:51.080
Doctor Colbert says
you're doing really well.

01:10:51.114 --> 01:10:53.149
- Well, in fact, I
just went to the gym

01:10:53.182 --> 01:10:55.084
before I came here today, so.

01:10:55.118 --> 01:10:58.121
- Wow, your voice
does sound stronger.

01:10:59.423 --> 01:11:00.790
- I think God is healing me.

01:11:02.359 --> 01:11:04.894
- I don't believe
there's any think to it.

01:11:04.928 --> 01:11:06.463
You look great.

01:11:06.496 --> 01:11:10.767
Hey, how about leading a
prayer call sometime soon?

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.235
- Sure.

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:13.937
I'd like that.

01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:15.171
- You're on, good.

01:11:15.204 --> 01:11:16.205
We'll see you later.

01:11:20.344 --> 01:11:22.145
- Thank you
very much, Mark.

01:11:23.046 --> 01:11:23.880
- Thanks, Jimmy.

01:11:28.785 --> 01:11:30.887
A lot of memories in this box.

01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:36.159
- Well, I'm sure he's
gonna appreciate it.

01:11:36.192 --> 01:11:37.661
- Have fun on the water.

01:11:37.694 --> 01:11:38.528
- Thank you.

01:11:46.670 --> 01:11:48.037
Here you go, son.

01:11:49.506 --> 01:11:52.409
You get a tackle
box, I get a boat.

01:12:19.035 --> 01:12:21.871
- Good morning,
prayer warriors.

01:12:21.905 --> 01:12:25.742
As you know, we'll be blowing
the Shofar on election day,

01:12:25.775 --> 01:12:28.378
so I've invited a
special guest to explain

01:12:28.412 --> 01:12:30.847
the significance of this event.

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:32.115
- Are we ready?

01:12:33.517 --> 01:12:34.884
Okay.

01:12:34.918 --> 01:12:36.352
Alright, everyone.

01:12:36.386 --> 01:12:39.355
The Shofar is called the voice.

01:12:39.389 --> 01:12:41.691
Blowing it is not a ritual.

01:12:41.725 --> 01:12:44.561
On your own, it's merely
the sound of a ram's horn.

01:12:45.929 --> 01:12:48.532
But when your voice is joined
together with God's voice,

01:12:48.565 --> 01:12:51.200
something shifts in
the spirit realm.

01:12:51.234 --> 01:12:53.870
It becomes a
supernatural weapon.

01:12:53.903 --> 01:12:56.172
It's a declaration
by God's people.

01:12:56.205 --> 01:12:59.342
That we are putting him on
the thrown over our nation.

01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:03.046
- That we may truly be
one nation under God.

01:13:03.079 --> 01:13:04.448
- Exactly.

01:13:04.481 --> 01:13:08.217
We're proclaiming
liberty over this nation.

01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:26.429
I'm Lorie Johnson.

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:29.132
Election day 2016
is finally here,

01:14:29.165 --> 01:14:31.668
and polls show a
very tight race.

01:14:31.701 --> 01:14:34.370
National polls show
Hillary Clinton ahead

01:14:34.403 --> 01:14:36.673
of GOP rival Donald Trump,

01:14:36.706 --> 01:14:39.108
but the two candidates
are in a dead heat

01:14:39.142 --> 01:14:41.811
in several key
battleground states.

01:14:41.845 --> 01:14:44.147
Sharlene Aron has the story.

01:14:45.414 --> 01:14:48.317
- Election day
voting officially kicked off

01:14:48.351 --> 01:14:49.686
at the stroke of midnight,

01:14:49.719 --> 01:14:52.556
as it always does in
the small community

01:14:52.589 --> 01:14:55.158
of Dixville Notch,
New Hampshire.

01:14:55.191 --> 01:14:56.626
Clinton has a slight lead

01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:58.695
in the average of
the most recent polls

01:14:58.728 --> 01:15:00.329
from the last few days.

01:15:00.363 --> 01:15:02.065
Still, the race
has gotten tighter.

01:15:02.098 --> 01:15:05.001
- Either I can't see what
God is really doing here,

01:15:05.034 --> 01:15:06.803
or I've completely
lost my mind.

01:15:06.836 --> 01:15:07.704
- He needs
to get the 278--

01:15:07.737 --> 01:15:08.872
- From the looks of things,

01:15:09.839 --> 01:15:12.375
it's gonna take a
miracle for Trump to win.

01:15:12.408 --> 01:15:13.643
- Late last night,

01:15:13.677 --> 01:15:15.211
the two candidates--
- It's in God's hands.

01:15:15.244 --> 01:15:16.746
I've had all I can take.

01:15:17.446 --> 01:15:19.883
- So it's
now officially,

01:15:19.916 --> 01:15:23.853
Tuesday, November eighth.

01:15:23.887 --> 01:15:25.088
I gotta tell you,

01:15:25.121 --> 01:15:28.024
this is sure worth
staying up for.

01:15:28.057 --> 01:15:29.225
- So there were so many states

01:15:29.258 --> 01:15:31.928
that were considered
battlegrounds.

01:15:31.961 --> 01:15:35.799
The state for example
of Pennsylvania.

01:15:37.033 --> 01:15:40.436
The state of North Carolina.

01:15:40.469 --> 01:15:42.105
The state of Florida.

01:15:42.939 --> 01:15:46.710
- And on and on.

01:15:46.743 --> 01:15:48.878
I've got 14 states, Pat,

01:15:48.912 --> 01:15:51.781
were within six points
or so in the polls.

01:15:51.815 --> 01:15:53.482
- Those boundaries--

01:15:59.789 --> 01:16:00.624
- Lord.

01:16:01.791 --> 01:16:03.326
I don't really understand this.

01:16:04.961 --> 01:16:05.895
But I trust you.

01:16:07.731 --> 01:16:09.298
And I know that you
have a plan.

01:16:11.735 --> 01:16:12.769
And thy will be done.

01:16:27.684 --> 01:16:29.252
- If we drill down
a little farther,

01:16:29.285 --> 01:16:33.256
in Florida, Donald Trump wins.

01:16:33.289 --> 01:16:37.093
And why does he win?

01:16:37.126 --> 01:16:38.327
- Oh my gosh.

01:16:38.361 --> 01:16:39.629
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh,
oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

01:16:39.663 --> 01:16:40.596
- Okay, honey.

01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:41.931
Keep praying, keep praying.

01:16:41.965 --> 01:16:44.600
There's still a lot
of night to go, yet.

01:16:44.634 --> 01:16:45.434
Yeah, she did fine.

01:16:45.468 --> 01:16:46.435
That wasn't the issue.

01:16:46.469 --> 01:16:47.603
The issue is, or I should say,

01:16:47.637 --> 01:16:49.105
the issue for
Hillary Clinton is,

01:16:49.138 --> 01:16:52.141
is that Donald Trump
has over-performed.

01:17:28.812 --> 01:17:31.547
- After the most
amazing election,

01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:33.549
Donald Trump has made history,

01:17:33.582 --> 01:17:35.384
shocking the political experts.

01:17:35.418 --> 01:17:37.020
- Mark, Mark.

01:17:37.053 --> 01:17:37.887
Mark.

01:17:39.989 --> 01:17:40.857
Mark.

01:17:40.890 --> 01:17:42.125
Mark, wake up.

01:17:42.158 --> 01:17:43.793
Mark, he won.

01:17:43.827 --> 01:17:45.328
Donald Trump won the election.

01:17:45.361 --> 01:17:46.629
It was called at 2:30 a.m.

01:17:46.662 --> 01:17:47.563
- Are you sure?

01:17:47.596 --> 01:17:49.198
- Yeah, it's all over the news.

01:17:50.366 --> 01:17:52.335
Clinton officially
conceded at 2:35.

01:17:54.537 --> 01:17:57.073
- Now it's time for America

01:17:57.106 --> 01:17:59.308
to bind the wounds of division.

01:17:59.342 --> 01:18:00.543
We have to get together.

01:18:01.911 --> 01:18:04.914
To all Republicans, and
Democrats, and Independents

01:18:04.948 --> 01:18:07.683
across this nation, I say,

01:18:07.717 --> 01:18:13.857
it is time for us to come
together as one united people.

01:18:15.591 --> 01:18:20.596
- It's a miracle.

01:18:21.264 --> 01:18:24.567
- It's certainly a testament
to the power of prayer.

01:18:27.536 --> 01:18:28.905
And in the process,

01:18:28.938 --> 01:18:30.239
turning the American
political map into a sea--

01:18:30.273 --> 01:18:31.775
- That's the trifecta,
Pat, that he needed,

01:18:31.808 --> 01:18:34.043
and then he needed to
penetrate Hillary Clinton's--

01:18:34.077 --> 01:18:34.911
- God did it.

01:18:36.079 --> 01:18:37.080
It's a miracle.

01:18:38.748 --> 01:18:39.582
- That it is.

01:18:42.451 --> 01:18:44.620
- You know
what's interesting, Pat.

01:18:44.653 --> 01:18:46.222
In Michigan, which
is fascinating,

01:18:46.255 --> 01:18:47.456
Macomb County, you
know that county.

01:18:47.490 --> 01:18:50.126
That's the Reagan
Democrats out there.

01:18:50.159 --> 01:18:51.627
- I can't believe this.

01:18:52.796 --> 01:18:53.629
- What?

01:18:55.598 --> 01:18:58.434
- There's a video
of people in Israel,

01:18:58.467 --> 01:19:00.269
who heard about
this American woman

01:19:00.303 --> 01:19:02.571
leading a grand
blowing of the Shofar.

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:07.076
Now, they're in the
streets of Israel,

01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:08.444
doing the same thing.

01:19:10.914 --> 01:19:11.948
It's crazy.

01:19:18.654 --> 01:19:22.425
- The spirit of
God, it's Israel.

01:19:23.927 --> 01:19:24.760
Israel.

01:19:25.962 --> 01:19:27.463
What about Israel?

01:19:30.599 --> 01:19:35.805
For Israel will be protected
by America once again.

01:19:37.473 --> 01:19:38.875
The spirit says yes.

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:48.217
America will once again, stand
hand in hand with Israel.

01:19:49.318 --> 01:19:51.054
And the two shall be as one.

- Second Chronicles, seven 14.

01:24:41.444 --> 01:24:43.112
I mean, it's very clear.

01:24:43.146 --> 01:24:46.115
My people, who are
called by my name.

01:24:46.149 --> 01:24:47.916
That means those of
us who are believers.

01:24:47.950 --> 01:24:49.818
We call ourselves Christians.

01:24:49.852 --> 01:24:52.288
We have an obligation
to pray for our country.

01:24:52.321 --> 01:24:53.756
I certainly do every night.

01:24:53.789 --> 01:24:56.325
- What's really interesting
about that passage

01:24:56.359 --> 01:24:58.261
from the Bible is that it says,

01:24:58.294 --> 01:25:00.729
if my people, who are
called by my name,

01:25:00.763 --> 01:25:04.333
will humble themselves and
pray, and seek my face.

01:25:04.367 --> 01:25:06.269
So he's not saying
all of America.

01:25:06.302 --> 01:25:08.571
He's not saying
all of the world.

01:25:08.604 --> 01:25:09.938
He's saying, my people.

01:25:09.972 --> 01:25:13.108
- The promise is Chronicles
that Solomon gave,

01:25:13.142 --> 01:25:15.911
that is so profound,
is that if my people,

01:25:15.944 --> 01:25:16.945
that are called by my name

01:25:16.979 --> 01:25:18.647
will humble themselves
and pray.

01:25:18.681 --> 01:25:20.249
If they'll turn from
their wicked ways,

01:25:20.283 --> 01:25:21.750
then I'll hear from Heaven.

01:25:21.784 --> 01:25:25.988
And so much of the repentance
and awakening and revival,

01:25:26.021 --> 01:25:27.690
hope of Christians in America

01:25:27.723 --> 01:25:29.592
is all about what
God's gonna do

01:25:29.625 --> 01:25:31.360
with the un-Christian
community.

01:25:31.394 --> 01:25:33.429
How he's gonna change them.

01:25:33.462 --> 01:25:35.464
When in fact that promise
has nothing to do with them.

01:25:35.498 --> 01:25:36.932
It has to do with us.

01:25:36.965 --> 01:25:38.834
It's how believers respond.

01:25:38.867 --> 01:25:42.471
It's how believers connect
with their President

01:25:42.505 --> 01:25:43.672
and this moment.

01:25:43.706 --> 01:25:45.808
That's what determines
the healing of the land.

01:25:45.841 --> 01:25:48.677
And so the real focus
of that promise is,

01:25:48.711 --> 01:25:51.113
believers have got to
get their act together

01:25:51.146 --> 01:25:53.148
if they want to preserve
their way of life.

01:25:53.182 --> 01:25:57.152
- The mandate of the
Bible is two-fold.

01:25:57.186 --> 01:25:59.188
You pray individually.

01:26:01.023 --> 01:26:03.692
In a closet, away
from anyone else.

01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:07.863
Primarily to find God's
will for yourself.

01:26:09.198 --> 01:26:12.635
God knows what you
want before you pray.

01:26:12.668 --> 01:26:16.939
You pray to build a
relationship with the lord.

01:26:18.106 --> 01:26:20.543
But it also says
to pray together.

01:26:20.576 --> 01:26:23.746
To pray in church,
the body of Christ.

01:26:23.779 --> 01:26:25.848
To pray in small groups.

01:26:25.881 --> 01:26:29.685
And where three are gathered,
he is there with us.

01:26:29.718 --> 01:26:32.355
So it's both individual
and it's collective.

01:26:32.388 --> 01:26:33.856
- Our founding
fathers would often

01:26:33.889 --> 01:26:35.491
have some of the most
critical meetings,

01:26:35.524 --> 01:26:37.760
when they would
accomplish so many things.

01:26:37.793 --> 01:26:39.061
They would leave those meetings

01:26:39.094 --> 01:26:41.864
and automatically walk
across the street,

01:26:41.897 --> 01:26:44.433
usually to a
religious facility,

01:26:44.467 --> 01:26:46.101
and have prayer afterwards.

01:26:46.134 --> 01:26:49.071
And thank the lord for
what had just happened.

01:26:49.104 --> 01:26:52.675
To me, that's where what
needs to be restored.

01:26:52.708 --> 01:26:55.244
Everybody talks about who's
the Commander-in-Chief?

01:26:55.278 --> 01:26:57.780
Commander-in-Chief is
still the man upstairs.

01:26:57.813 --> 01:27:01.384
And unfortunately, on
both sides of the aisle,

01:27:01.417 --> 01:27:03.419
our politicians
have forgotten that.

01:27:03.452 --> 01:27:05.020
They seem to have
forgotten that.

01:27:05.053 --> 01:27:07.556
- Presidents like
Adams and Madison

01:27:07.590 --> 01:27:11.894
would call every year for
a national day of prayer

01:27:11.927 --> 01:27:13.729
and humiliation.

01:27:13.762 --> 01:27:17.099
And it was observed
by the whole nation.

01:27:17.132 --> 01:27:19.368
- Founding father John
Hancock had a great quote.

01:27:19.402 --> 01:27:23.205
He said, I urge you, by
all that's honorable,

01:27:23.238 --> 01:27:25.274
by all that's dear,
by all that's holy,

01:27:25.308 --> 01:27:26.575
not only that you pray,

01:27:26.609 --> 01:27:28.277
but also that you act.

01:27:28.311 --> 01:27:29.612
- In other words,

01:27:29.645 --> 01:27:33.248
we can't just kick
back and passively

01:27:33.282 --> 01:27:35.284
await redemption to come.

01:27:36.585 --> 01:27:39.922
We are put in this
world to do things,

01:27:39.955 --> 01:27:41.557
to accomplish things.

01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:44.927
We are put in this world
to partner with God

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:47.763
in bringing holiness
and sanctity

01:27:47.796 --> 01:27:50.265
into this material world.

01:27:50.299 --> 01:27:51.734
- I think it's very important,

01:27:51.767 --> 01:27:53.469
but I think there's
something in that passage

01:27:53.502 --> 01:27:55.103
that is important for leaders.

01:27:55.137 --> 01:27:57.440
It says, if you
humble yourself.

01:27:57.473 --> 01:27:59.107
It's one thing to pray.

01:27:59.141 --> 01:28:01.143
It's another thing
to be humble.

01:28:01.176 --> 01:28:03.946
And the humility that is
needed from leadership,

01:28:03.979 --> 01:28:06.415
so that God can
move through them

01:28:06.449 --> 01:28:08.451
to a nation that is hurting,

01:28:08.484 --> 01:28:11.854
is needed more today
than any other time.

01:28:11.887 --> 01:28:13.622
We can pray.

01:28:13.656 --> 01:28:14.457
I love prayer.

01:28:14.490 --> 01:28:16.091
I'm a prayer person.

01:28:16.124 --> 01:28:17.292
But at the same time,

01:28:17.326 --> 01:28:19.662
humility is what
God is looking for.

01:28:19.695 --> 01:28:24.132
He said, if you're humble,
I'll find you, actually.

01:28:24.166 --> 01:28:28.303
And so I think that passage
of scripture is famous

01:28:28.337 --> 01:28:31.707
for prayer, but I want it
to be famous for humility.

01:28:31.740 --> 01:28:33.442
- The salvation for America

01:28:33.476 --> 01:28:36.144
is the collection of believers.

01:28:36.178 --> 01:28:38.981
Just enough who will
get on our knees,

01:28:39.014 --> 01:28:40.549
and humble ourselves,

01:28:40.583 --> 01:28:43.486
and recognize our
goal needs to be

01:28:43.519 --> 01:28:44.987
the maintenance of liberty.

01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:46.489
- And it all comes back down

01:28:46.522 --> 01:28:49.057
to Second Chronicles seven, 14.

01:28:49.091 --> 01:28:50.959
If we want God to
hear from Heaven,

01:28:50.993 --> 01:28:52.995
to forgive our sin
and heal our land,

01:28:53.028 --> 01:28:55.498
there's a checklist that
we're supposed to follow.

01:28:55.531 --> 01:28:57.700
We all know it's to
humble ourselves and pray,

01:28:57.733 --> 01:29:00.135
to seek God's face
and not just his hand.

01:29:00.168 --> 01:29:01.336
But the fourth point,

01:29:01.370 --> 01:29:03.305
the essential thing
that we need to do

01:29:03.338 --> 01:29:05.007
for God to heal our land

01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:07.743
is for us to turn
from our wicked ways.

01:29:07.776 --> 01:29:09.512
It's the part most
people forget.

01:29:09.545 --> 01:29:11.380
And if we can turn
from our wicked ways,

01:29:11.414 --> 01:29:13.649
we can make America good again,

01:29:13.682 --> 01:29:15.250
and make America great again.

01:29:16.385 --> 01:29:19.054
- You know, at
first I didn't quite

01:29:19.087 --> 01:29:20.523
understand or appreciate

01:29:20.556 --> 01:29:24.393
the campaign phrase,
Make America Great Again.

01:29:25.928 --> 01:29:27.162
But after pondering it,

01:29:27.195 --> 01:29:29.031
and after watching
President Trump

01:29:29.064 --> 01:29:30.666
as he goes about his duties

01:29:30.699 --> 01:29:34.269
as not only the President,
but the Commander-in-Chief,

01:29:34.302 --> 01:29:35.604
I think I understand it now.

01:29:35.638 --> 01:29:38.541
You know, our founding
fathers gave us

01:29:38.574 --> 01:29:40.576
a Constitutional Republic.

01:29:41.744 --> 01:29:44.379
And in that Constitution
that they left to us,

01:29:44.413 --> 01:29:46.582
they give us freedoms.

01:29:46.615 --> 01:29:49.051
Those freedoms are articulated.

01:29:49.084 --> 01:29:51.454
And I think that what
has happened to America

01:29:51.487 --> 01:29:53.722
over the last few
years is we have

01:29:53.756 --> 01:29:57.192
lost our focus on what
those Constitutional

01:29:57.225 --> 01:29:58.627
freedoms really are.

01:29:58.661 --> 01:30:01.096
And I think that what
Mr. Trump was saying was,

01:30:02.297 --> 01:30:03.699
that he wanted to
help move America

01:30:03.732 --> 01:30:05.701
back to a focus on,

01:30:05.734 --> 01:30:07.636
what are our
Constitutional freedoms.

01:30:07.670 --> 01:30:09.772
And he's doing just that.

01:30:09.805 --> 01:30:11.474
- When I look at making
America great again,

01:30:11.507 --> 01:30:12.975
it's kind of like taking

01:30:13.008 --> 01:30:16.078
some of the good things that
America was in recent decades

01:30:16.111 --> 01:30:17.379
and bringing them
back to the top.

01:30:17.412 --> 01:30:19.047
- It's important
to keep in mind,

01:30:19.081 --> 01:30:20.315
when you're thinking
about what it takes

01:30:20.348 --> 01:30:22.250
to make America great again,

01:30:22.284 --> 01:30:25.754
that the key element is
spiritual, not secular.

01:30:25.788 --> 01:30:31.293
It depends upon a common
bond of the people,

01:30:31.326 --> 01:30:34.329
wanting something for each
other, not just themselves.

01:30:34.362 --> 01:30:38.834
And the state of the United
States of America in 1776,

01:30:38.867 --> 01:30:41.770
it was that birth
is not destiny.

01:30:41.804 --> 01:30:45.608
And that all rights
come from God.

01:30:45.641 --> 01:30:47.843
And are not created
by government.

01:30:47.876 --> 01:30:50.813
Government is here to
facilitate and protect

01:30:50.846 --> 01:30:52.881
the rights that God gives us.

01:30:53.816 --> 01:30:55.017
- Yeah, I think actually,

01:30:55.050 --> 01:30:57.019
in order to really
change America,

01:30:57.052 --> 01:30:59.154
to make America great again,

01:30:59.187 --> 01:31:01.924
we're going to have
to have a revival

01:31:01.957 --> 01:31:04.126
of spirituality in
the United States.

01:31:04.159 --> 01:31:07.295
And I see signs of that happening,
and starting to happen.

01:31:07.329 --> 01:31:08.463
- The American values I think

01:31:08.497 --> 01:31:09.932
that need to be brought back

01:31:09.965 --> 01:31:11.366
were set forth in the
Declaration of Independence.

01:31:11.399 --> 01:31:13.468
I think we have excellent
founding documents.

01:31:13.502 --> 01:31:16.304
I think they've produced
really a stability

01:31:16.338 --> 01:31:17.773
that no other nation's had.

01:31:17.806 --> 01:31:20.709
Average nation has a new
Constitution every 17 years.

01:31:20.743 --> 01:31:22.978
We've gone 200 plus
years with ours.

01:31:23.011 --> 01:31:24.647
So when I look at the
Declaration that says,

01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:26.281
number one, there is a God.

01:31:26.314 --> 01:31:28.984
Number two, that that
God gives certain

01:31:29.017 --> 01:31:30.786
inalienable rights
to every individual.

01:31:30.819 --> 01:31:32.120
Number three, that
government exists

01:31:32.154 --> 01:31:34.056
primarily to protect
inalienable rights.

01:31:34.089 --> 01:31:36.224
And number four, there
is a fixed moral law.

01:31:36.258 --> 01:31:38.060
Then five, the majority wins.

01:31:38.093 --> 01:31:39.662
The consent of the governed.

01:31:39.695 --> 01:31:41.997
Those are values that we've
seen really disappear,

01:31:42.030 --> 01:31:43.699
all five of them,
in recent years.

01:31:43.732 --> 01:31:45.300
So bringing those back,

01:31:45.333 --> 01:31:47.836
which is the basis of the
Declaration, Constitution,

01:31:47.870 --> 01:31:49.137
that's really key to me,

01:31:49.171 --> 01:31:50.873
having a kind of God-friendly,

01:31:50.906 --> 01:31:53.341
God-conscious society
with limited government

01:31:53.375 --> 01:31:55.143
that believes it is not God,

01:31:55.177 --> 01:31:56.679
but it is there to
serve the people.

01:31:56.712 --> 01:31:59.081
- Well, the
historical attributes,

01:31:59.114 --> 01:32:00.482
and the thing I
think about the most

01:32:00.515 --> 01:32:02.350
as far as being restored is,

01:32:02.384 --> 01:32:04.587
is really when it comes
to the Constitution.

01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:07.155
It seems like the Constitution
has really been challenged

01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:09.992
over the past eight,
nine years or so,

01:32:10.025 --> 01:32:11.560
in many many areas.

01:32:11.594 --> 01:32:15.998
And I think that part of the
challenge that we face is

01:32:16.031 --> 01:32:19.702
really having the right
person on the Supreme Court,

01:32:19.735 --> 01:32:23.171
who really is going to
abide by the Constitution.

01:32:23.205 --> 01:32:25.540
- And when you move away
from those landmarks,

01:32:25.574 --> 01:32:27.710
and those foundations,

01:32:27.743 --> 01:32:31.213
now you go on to, the
Bible clearly says,

01:32:31.246 --> 01:32:32.414
matter of fact,

01:32:32.447 --> 01:32:33.682
if the foundation
to be destroyed.

01:32:33.716 --> 01:32:34.717
What can the righteous do?

01:32:34.750 --> 01:32:37.219
So when you
destroy foundations,

01:32:37.252 --> 01:32:40.923
you destroy the under pending
of what you were built upon.

01:32:40.956 --> 01:32:42.891
And so we've got
to make sure that

01:32:42.925 --> 01:32:47.362
we restore those kinds of
attitudes back in America.

01:32:47.395 --> 01:32:49.097
- And America's
role in the world

01:32:49.131 --> 01:32:51.867
is literally the
guardian of a free order,

01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:54.903
and it really supports
the economic stability

01:32:54.937 --> 01:32:57.873
of nations that have
the gospel preached.

01:32:57.906 --> 01:33:00.042
And so in a very
significant way,

01:33:00.075 --> 01:33:01.476
making America great again

01:33:01.509 --> 01:33:04.747
is about preserving the
strength of the United States

01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:08.083
in a very competitive,
ideologic conflict of nations.

01:33:08.116 --> 01:33:11.820
So that as America is strong,
democracy can be strong.

01:33:11.854 --> 01:33:14.156
- So the American economy's
influence in the world

01:33:14.189 --> 01:33:15.758
is quite dramatic.

01:33:15.791 --> 01:33:16.959
It's the number one
economy in the world.

01:33:16.992 --> 01:33:18.961
It's the largest
economy in the world.

01:33:18.994 --> 01:33:20.428
It has the largest GDP.

01:33:20.462 --> 01:33:22.330
And because of that,

01:33:22.364 --> 01:33:24.767
the rest of the world's wealth

01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:26.234
and the rest of the
world's prosperity

01:33:26.268 --> 01:33:29.004
is dependent upon
the United States.

01:33:29.037 --> 01:33:30.405
We see trade with China.

01:33:30.438 --> 01:33:31.606
We see trade with Europe.

01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:34.342
We see all the different
trade that we have.

01:33:34.376 --> 01:33:37.112
In the case of Canada,
where I come from,

01:33:37.145 --> 01:33:40.148
85% of Canada's trade is
with the United States.

01:33:40.182 --> 01:33:41.784
So the Canadian
economy, for example,

01:33:41.817 --> 01:33:44.419
is totally dependent
upon the United States.

01:33:44.452 --> 01:33:47.455
- It is the American
economy is to the world

01:33:47.489 --> 01:33:51.827
what a tide, an incoming tide
is, that lifts all boats.

01:33:53.028 --> 01:33:55.497
When the American
economy is strong,

01:33:55.530 --> 01:33:58.100
other people from other nations

01:33:58.133 --> 01:33:59.802
get to sell into this market,

01:33:59.835 --> 01:34:02.304
which is the wealthiest
market in the world.

01:34:02.337 --> 01:34:04.272
And so it lifts all boats.

01:34:04.306 --> 01:34:05.841
- 'Cause any time
there's a disaster,

01:34:05.874 --> 01:34:08.677
it's the United States
that's first on the scene.

01:34:08.711 --> 01:34:09.978
Why?

01:34:10.012 --> 01:34:12.614
Because of our system of
free market enterprise,

01:34:12.647 --> 01:34:15.383
we've been able to create
wealth in this nation.

01:34:15.417 --> 01:34:18.553
And you can't help other
people unless you have wealth.

01:34:18.586 --> 01:34:21.056
And so we should never
apologize for the fact

01:34:21.089 --> 01:34:24.192
that in this country, we
know how to create wealth.

01:34:24.226 --> 01:34:27.395
And we need to know
how to use it wisely.

01:34:27.429 --> 01:34:31.666
- Besides the
maintain the peace,

01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:33.468
providing a marketplace
for other economies

01:34:33.501 --> 01:34:35.704
to be able to sell their
goods and services,

01:34:36.772 --> 01:34:39.742
the United States' greatest
contribution to the world

01:34:40.442 --> 01:34:44.579
are the spiritual
aspects of integrity,

01:34:44.612 --> 01:34:46.715
of proper relationships between

01:34:46.749 --> 01:34:49.617
government and those
governed that we present.

01:34:50.552 --> 01:34:52.320
- There are many who say that

01:34:52.354 --> 01:34:54.022
when America sneezes,
the rest of the world

01:34:54.056 --> 01:34:55.390
catches a cold.

01:34:55.423 --> 01:35:01.196
And if we are not
strong in our economics,

01:35:01.229 --> 01:35:03.531
then the rest of the world
is gonna suffer tremendously.

01:35:03.565 --> 01:35:05.033
All you have to do is
travel around the world.

01:35:05.067 --> 01:35:07.169
If anybody want to see
what this look like,

01:35:07.202 --> 01:35:08.871
just travel a little
bit around the world,

01:35:08.904 --> 01:35:11.874
and see the effect of
the dollar

01:35:11.907 --> 01:35:14.376
that it has on other economies.

01:35:14.409 --> 01:35:16.945
And so, we've got to
have a strong dollar.

01:35:16.979 --> 01:35:18.881
We need to have a
strong economy

01:35:18.914 --> 01:35:20.048
so that we can help.

01:35:20.082 --> 01:35:21.716
Because the other thing
about this nation is

01:35:21.750 --> 01:35:25.754
we give more than any
other nation on the planet.

01:35:25.788 --> 01:35:28.590
We are the most charitable
people on the planet.

01:35:28.623 --> 01:35:30.092
And so as a result of that,

01:35:30.125 --> 01:35:32.928
we're taking care of a lot
of people around this world

01:35:32.961 --> 01:35:36.731
that would not have if
America was not here.

01:35:36.765 --> 01:35:39.768
- We go back to the
very concept of freedom.

01:35:39.802 --> 01:35:43.271
America was created
to be a society

01:35:43.305 --> 01:35:45.440
that encouraged
freedom at all levels,

01:35:45.473 --> 01:35:47.910
to include economically.

01:35:47.943 --> 01:35:50.245
The free market
system, capitalism,

01:35:50.278 --> 01:35:53.081
is what America was founded on.

01:35:53.115 --> 01:35:55.918
Was people being able
to pull themselves up,

01:35:55.951 --> 01:35:59.454
and with a little courage
and some ingenuity

01:35:59.487 --> 01:36:01.323
and entrepreneurialism,

01:36:01.356 --> 01:36:03.158
to be able to build
their own business,

01:36:03.191 --> 01:36:04.626
and make their own way,

01:36:04.659 --> 01:36:08.096
and not have to settle for
their circumstances at birth,

01:36:08.130 --> 01:36:09.597
or their upbringing.

01:36:09.631 --> 01:36:12.567
- And of course it also is
beneficial to the world,

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:13.936
not only economically,

01:36:13.969 --> 01:36:18.240
but in terms of other concerns.

01:36:18.273 --> 01:36:20.843
For example, when the
American economy is strong,

01:36:20.876 --> 01:36:23.311
and the military is
kept strong,

01:36:24.479 --> 01:36:27.482
piracy all over the
world is phased down.

01:36:28.683 --> 01:36:31.353
Tyrants all over the
world are phased down.

01:36:31.386 --> 01:36:32.955
- A healthy American military

01:36:32.988 --> 01:36:37.692
is very important to
the whole world because

01:36:37.725 --> 01:36:39.828
we are the only ones
that can stand up

01:36:39.862 --> 01:36:43.465
to some of these despots,
dictators, bullies,

01:36:43.498 --> 01:36:44.766
around the world.

01:36:44.799 --> 01:36:46.268
No other country, you
know other countries--

01:36:46.301 --> 01:36:49.104
These socialist countries
in Europe, for example,

01:36:49.137 --> 01:36:51.806
have cut their militaries
to the point that

01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:55.043
they barely have a
constabulary force.

01:36:55.077 --> 01:36:56.778
Because they wanted
to put all that money

01:36:56.811 --> 01:36:58.480
into social programs.

01:36:58.513 --> 01:37:01.316
And they've become socialist.

01:37:01.349 --> 01:37:04.619
An American military that can
stand against adversaries,

01:37:04.652 --> 01:37:08.023
that can defend our allies
as well as ourselves,

01:37:09.091 --> 01:37:12.127
is very very critical
to the strength

01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:15.163
of the international community.

01:37:15.197 --> 01:37:18.566
- We are literally the glue

01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:20.168
that keeps the
peace in the world.

01:37:20.202 --> 01:37:21.904
And is there a price
to pay for that

01:37:21.937 --> 01:37:23.171
by the American public?

01:37:23.205 --> 01:37:26.308
Yes, but at the same
time, it's necessary.

01:37:26.341 --> 01:37:28.543
- I've been reporting on the
front lines of Israel's history

01:37:28.576 --> 01:37:31.379
and throughout the Middle
East since the year 2000.

01:37:31.413 --> 01:37:34.082
When President Trump
was elected in 2016,

01:37:34.116 --> 01:37:37.352
you could notice a marked
change here in the Middle East.

01:37:37.385 --> 01:37:39.687
The main reason is
because the United States

01:37:39.721 --> 01:37:42.024
could be trusted to
back up its word,

01:37:42.057 --> 01:37:44.192
and the United States
projected strength

01:37:44.226 --> 01:37:45.360
throughout the region.

01:37:45.393 --> 01:37:47.695
Something that's
respected a great deal.

01:37:47.729 --> 01:37:49.764
You could sense
that in Kurdistan,

01:37:49.797 --> 01:37:51.666
for the Kurds that
the United States

01:37:51.699 --> 01:37:53.068
would stand behind them.

01:37:53.101 --> 01:37:55.370
You could see that
in refugee camps

01:37:55.403 --> 01:37:56.939
for persecuted Christians,

01:37:56.972 --> 01:37:58.706
when they know that
the United States

01:37:58.740 --> 01:38:00.075
would speak up for them.

01:38:00.108 --> 01:38:02.210
You could notice that in
the streets of Tehran,

01:38:02.244 --> 01:38:03.711
when people went
to the streets,

01:38:03.745 --> 01:38:05.780
and Iranians protested
against the tyranny

01:38:05.813 --> 01:38:07.615
of the Islamic Mullahs,

01:38:07.649 --> 01:38:10.118
that somebody would
speak up on their behalf.

01:38:10.152 --> 01:38:11.353
So because of strength,

01:38:11.386 --> 01:38:12.887
because of the United States,

01:38:12.921 --> 01:38:14.556
standing behind its word,

01:38:14.589 --> 01:38:16.591
what President Trump
has said it would do.

01:38:16.624 --> 01:38:19.227
It makes a huge change
here in the Middle East.

01:38:19.261 --> 01:38:22.230
It makes its allies
more trusted.

01:38:22.264 --> 01:38:24.799
It makes its
enemies more feared.

01:38:24.832 --> 01:38:28.103
- In the world, there
is no greater epicenter

01:38:28.136 --> 01:38:30.372
than Jerusalem, Israel.

01:38:30.405 --> 01:38:33.375
And our own United
States State Department

01:38:33.408 --> 01:38:35.143
has done everything
that it could

01:38:35.177 --> 01:38:41.283
to stop Israel from being
able to name Jerusalem

01:38:41.316 --> 01:38:43.751
as their capitol, as
far as the United States

01:38:43.785 --> 01:38:45.487
government is concerned.

01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:47.956
And recognizing that capitol.

01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:50.925
Israel's been a
state since 1948.

01:38:50.959 --> 01:38:54.329
I was there for the
Independence Day celebration.

01:38:54.362 --> 01:38:57.432
70 years, Israel
has been a nation.

01:38:57.465 --> 01:39:00.102
And yet, only Israel
has been denied

01:39:00.135 --> 01:39:02.604
the right to name
their own capitol.

01:39:02.637 --> 01:39:04.639
- Jerusalem has always been

01:39:04.672 --> 01:39:08.643
the heart and soul
of the Jewish people.

01:39:08.676 --> 01:39:13.815
Even when our ancestors were
in exile for 1,900 years.

01:39:13.848 --> 01:39:17.785
And were unable to
ascend to the land,

01:39:17.819 --> 01:39:23.458
and visit the site
of our holy temples.

01:39:24.292 --> 01:39:28.096
Jerusalem was always in their
thoughts and their prayers.

01:39:28.130 --> 01:39:30.198
- There's a lot of people that
say, you know, why Israel?

01:39:30.232 --> 01:39:31.633
Why does it matter?

01:39:31.666 --> 01:39:33.301
Not only is it our only
democracy in the Middle East,

01:39:33.335 --> 01:39:35.970
not only is it our best
friend in that region.

01:39:36.004 --> 01:39:38.773
But if you wanna be on
the right side of history,

01:39:38.806 --> 01:39:40.342
you wanna be on God's side.

01:39:40.375 --> 01:39:43.111
And if God is for
Israel, and he is,

01:39:43.145 --> 01:39:45.347
then I wanna be for Israel.

01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:47.982
God said that he will bless
those that bless them.

01:39:48.016 --> 01:39:49.817
That we are to pray for
the peace of Jerusalem.

01:39:49.851 --> 01:39:52.487
When I saw that President Trump

01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:56.324
changed the embassy,
and basically said, no,

01:39:56.358 --> 01:39:58.026
we are going to acknowledge

01:39:58.060 --> 01:40:00.228
the capitol of
Israel as Jerusalem,

01:40:00.262 --> 01:40:02.564
and move our embassy where it
should have been all along.

01:40:02.597 --> 01:40:04.066
I just, I was cheering.

01:40:04.099 --> 01:40:06.201
I was actually crying as I
was watching those speeches.

01:40:06.234 --> 01:40:08.002
As they made that dedication.

01:40:08.036 --> 01:40:10.205
It's just so encouraging.

01:40:10.238 --> 01:40:12.307
What we need to do
is stand with Israel,

01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:13.808
because God stands with Israel.

01:40:13.841 --> 01:40:15.810
- One of the greatest
principles in the Bible

01:40:15.843 --> 01:40:18.146
to the Jewish people is
found in the Book of Genesis,

01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:21.349
on chapter 12, where it says
that God would bless those

01:40:21.383 --> 01:40:22.850
who bless the Jewish people.

01:40:22.884 --> 01:40:25.487
And President Trump in
so many practical ways

01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:26.988
has stood behind Israel,

01:40:27.021 --> 01:40:29.991
has had its back
diplomatically and militarily,

01:40:30.024 --> 01:40:32.594
and has also moved the
United States embassy

01:40:32.627 --> 01:40:34.362
from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

01:40:34.396 --> 01:40:38.200
That's a huge diplomat historic,
even prophetic statement.

01:40:38.233 --> 01:40:40.268
Because of the blessing
that President Trump

01:40:40.302 --> 01:40:42.036
has bestowed on
the Jewish people,

01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:44.372
that will reap
economic, diplomatic,

01:40:44.406 --> 01:40:46.074
and even spiritual blessings

01:40:46.108 --> 01:40:47.609
for the United States.

01:40:47.642 --> 01:40:50.112
- You know, the uniqueness
of Israel in the Bible,

01:40:50.145 --> 01:40:51.713
and for Christians,

01:40:51.746 --> 01:40:55.950
is that it represents
the promises of God,

01:40:55.983 --> 01:40:59.121
that he is going to be
restoring a people to a land,

01:40:59.154 --> 01:41:02.257
and he's going to prosper
a people in the land.

01:41:02.290 --> 01:41:04.559
There again, it's an
interesting reality.

01:41:04.592 --> 01:41:07.028
That Donald Trump and
Israel have this in common.

01:41:07.061 --> 01:41:08.430
They have global enemies,

01:41:08.463 --> 01:41:09.931
that are very much interested

01:41:09.964 --> 01:41:13.568
in developing a narrative
that would destroy them.

01:41:13.601 --> 01:41:17.038
And so the United States
has a covenant relationship

01:41:17.071 --> 01:41:19.307
in a sense with God,

01:41:19.341 --> 01:41:21.409
formed out of the founders,

01:41:21.443 --> 01:41:23.411
and the way in
which they approach

01:41:23.445 --> 01:41:25.046
creating the unique experiment

01:41:25.079 --> 01:41:28.049
of an American community
founded with religious liberty.

01:41:28.082 --> 01:41:30.652
The only other nation that
shares that in common is Israel.

01:41:30.685 --> 01:41:35.223
- I believe that our
relationship with Israel is key.

01:41:35.257 --> 01:41:37.325
Not only as an ally.

01:41:37.359 --> 01:41:40.795
But because God said,
if you bless Israel,

01:41:40.828 --> 01:41:42.597
you're gonna be blessed.

01:41:42.630 --> 01:41:46.268
You can't make it any
simpler than that.

01:41:46.301 --> 01:41:48.270
That's plain and simple for me.

01:41:48.303 --> 01:41:50.272
- And I believe that
one of the other things

01:41:50.305 --> 01:41:52.974
we need to do is not
only to support Israel,

01:41:53.007 --> 01:41:55.410
but we need to cut
off the funding,

01:41:55.443 --> 01:41:57.345
and the support to
the enemies of Israel.

01:41:57.379 --> 01:41:59.147
Because the enemies of Israel,

01:41:59.181 --> 01:42:00.982
the same nations
that wanna eradicate

01:42:01.015 --> 01:42:02.450
Israel from off the map,

01:42:02.484 --> 01:42:04.452
are the same countries
that aren't real fond

01:42:04.486 --> 01:42:05.420
of the United States.

01:42:05.453 --> 01:42:06.788
- I was privileged to be asked

01:42:06.821 --> 01:42:09.157
to do election night
coverage with David Barton.

01:42:09.191 --> 01:42:10.792
It's the first time
I'd ever done it,

01:42:10.825 --> 01:42:13.027
and it was the first
time that the ministry

01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:14.962
down in Dallas
had ever done it.

01:42:14.996 --> 01:42:17.031
It was broadcast, I
think, on Daystar TV,

01:42:17.064 --> 01:42:20.535
a number of different
channels broadcast it.

01:42:20.568 --> 01:42:23.004
And we were excited because

01:42:23.037 --> 01:42:25.540
there was a sanctuary
attached to the studio,

01:42:25.573 --> 01:42:28.343
filled with intercessory
prayer warriors.

01:42:28.376 --> 01:42:30.645
They had been there
praying for a long time,

01:42:30.678 --> 01:42:32.113
and of course there had been

01:42:32.146 --> 01:42:34.182
many ministries who
had asked people

01:42:34.216 --> 01:42:36.351
to pray for 50 days
before the election,

01:42:36.384 --> 01:42:38.286
or 40 days before the election.

01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:39.821
And so there's a lot
of bathing and prayer.

01:42:39.854 --> 01:42:41.956
When I came to the
studio that night,

01:42:41.989 --> 01:42:45.293
there's a flat screen TV on
the wall in the green room,

01:42:45.327 --> 01:42:47.895
and when I came in, I
was watching the screen,

01:42:47.929 --> 01:42:50.198
and suddenly I saw
all these people

01:42:50.232 --> 01:42:52.567
rush up to the
front of the altar.

01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:55.837
They went on their face,
and they're on their knees,

01:42:55.870 --> 01:42:57.372
and they were in prayer.

01:42:57.405 --> 01:42:58.873
And I turned around and asked
the people in the green room,

01:42:58.906 --> 01:42:59.707
who is that?

01:42:59.741 --> 01:43:01.008
Where is this happening?

01:43:01.042 --> 01:43:02.244
Because I knew that there was

01:43:02.277 --> 01:43:04.312
a sanctuary attached
to the studio.

01:43:04.346 --> 01:43:06.548
I assumed that it
was in Dallas, Texas.

01:43:06.581 --> 01:43:09.751
And they said, oh
no, that's Jerusalem.

01:43:09.784 --> 01:43:12.354
And these are
believers from China,

01:43:12.387 --> 01:43:14.489
who came in specifically

01:43:14.522 --> 01:43:17.692
to be in prayer for
the American election.

01:43:17.725 --> 01:43:19.861
And so they're on
their knees, praying,

01:43:19.894 --> 01:43:21.696
because they knew
dependent upon

01:43:21.729 --> 01:43:23.698
how the election turned out,

01:43:23.731 --> 01:43:26.334
so too Israel's fortunes

01:43:26.368 --> 01:43:28.370
could perhaps hang
in the balance.

01:43:28.403 --> 01:43:30.071
- As far as our
country is concerned,

01:43:30.104 --> 01:43:33.074
obviously there's always a
lot of times, misconceptions,

01:43:33.107 --> 01:43:36.378
or everybody have
their own idea.

01:43:36.411 --> 01:43:37.545
And there's nothing wrong

01:43:37.579 --> 01:43:38.580
with everyone having
their own idea.

01:43:38.613 --> 01:43:39.581
I can disagree with you,

01:43:39.614 --> 01:43:41.749
you can disagree with me.

01:43:41.783 --> 01:43:42.950
But in the end,

01:43:42.984 --> 01:43:46.020
we really have to do
what's best for America.

01:43:46.053 --> 01:43:48.790
Because when you do what's
best for your own home,

01:43:48.823 --> 01:43:50.925
I think it's a positive
effect around the country.

01:43:50.958 --> 01:43:53.094
- God uses our hands
and he uses our feet.

01:43:53.127 --> 01:43:54.796
He uses our minds.

01:43:54.829 --> 01:43:56.097
And so we have to recognize.

01:43:56.130 --> 01:43:58.733
This is just more than
about our happiness.

01:43:58.766 --> 01:44:01.903
The United States is really
a beacon for the world.

01:44:01.936 --> 01:44:04.071
A city on the hill,
so to speak.

01:44:04.105 --> 01:44:07.141
And so as long as we
name the name of our God,

01:44:07.174 --> 01:44:10.478
and as long as we follow
Biblical attributes,

01:44:10.512 --> 01:44:11.813
America will be strong.

01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:13.915
- The most important thing

01:44:13.948 --> 01:44:16.884
we can do for our
country is to pray.

01:44:16.918 --> 01:44:19.086
- My people who are
called by my name.

01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:22.256
- Will humble themselves
and pray, and seek my face.

01:44:22.290 --> 01:44:23.658
- They'll turn from
their wicked ways,

01:44:23.691 --> 01:44:24.626
then I'll hear from Heaven.

01:44:24.659 --> 01:44:26.160
- And I will forgive
their sins,

01:44:26.193 --> 01:44:29.431
and I will restore the
richness of their lands,

01:44:29.464 --> 01:44:31.132
and of their home.
