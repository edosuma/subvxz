WEBVTT

00:07.374 --> 00:08.864
So? How did it go?

00:08.975 --> 00:10.499
Absolutely incredible, sir.

00:10.610 --> 00:13.738
You can forget about the Ori. With an act
like that, Sam will be headlining in Vegas.

00:13.847 --> 00:14.836
Okay, stop.

00:14.948 --> 00:17.974
The performance of the device did exceed
all expectations, General Landry.

00:18.084 --> 00:19.984
I'm telling you, sir,
a few tweaks here and there,

00:20.086 --> 00:24.022
we'll be able to hide anything we want,
troops, ships, planets.

00:24.124 --> 00:26.092
It's a lot more complicated than that, sir,

00:26.192 --> 00:28.422
but I do think we're ready
for a large-scale test.

00:28.528 --> 00:31.964
Good. Get changed.
I may have just the thing.

00:36.069 --> 00:39.630
Colonel Reynolds has been conducting
reconnaissance on P9C-882,

00:39.739 --> 00:43.539
as part of the ongoing mission
to track the Ori advance in the galaxy.

00:43.643 --> 00:47.409
Approximately four hours ago,
the people of 882 were visited by a Prior.

00:47.514 --> 00:50.608
Let me guess. He made them
an offer they couldn't refuse.

00:50.717 --> 00:53.481
With a slight twist.
He told them to build this.

00:59.192 --> 01:01.160
I take it you've seen that before?

01:01.261 --> 01:02.285
Yes.

01:02.395 --> 01:06.957
They use these to burn people alive
who don't follow their rules.

01:08.301 --> 01:09.461
He gave them three days,

01:09.569 --> 01:12.470
at which time, he said
he'd return to check their progress.

01:12.572 --> 01:16.099
- What has been the villagers' response?
- Already rejected the idea.

01:16.643 --> 01:18.474
They lived under the Goa'uld for centuries.

01:18.578 --> 01:20.341
They're not about to give up
their freedom again.

01:20.447 --> 01:22.540
They've asked for our help.

01:22.649 --> 01:25.015
You want to use Sam's device
to make them disappear.

01:25.118 --> 01:29.680
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on a second.
First of all, it's Merlin's device.

01:29.789 --> 01:33.156
And second, while I agree the
modifications I've made have potential,

01:33.259 --> 01:36.126
it's far from ready to deploy in the field
on that scale.

01:36.229 --> 01:38.754
But I'm sure that that's not
what the General is proposing.

01:38.865 --> 01:41.698
Actually, Colonel,
that is what I'm proposing.

01:41.801 --> 01:44.429
The IOA has reviewed the reports
of your experiments,

01:44.537 --> 01:47.870
and they think it's time to take
this new technology out of the lab.

01:47.974 --> 01:49.202
I happen to agree with them.

01:49.309 --> 01:55.248
With respect, sir, you're talking about
trying to hide an entire village of people.

01:55.348 --> 02:00.684
I realize it's a tall order, Colonel, but
we seem to have a three-day window here.

02:00.787 --> 02:04.883
Any chance you can make
the necessary adjustments in that time?

02:04.991 --> 02:07.050
Can do, sir. Not a problem.

02:08.027 --> 02:08.994
Good.

02:12.932 --> 02:16.834
What? Don't look at me like that.
You've got a village to save.

03:27.373 --> 03:29.933
You have returned. Bless us all.

03:30.343 --> 03:33.369
SG-1, this is Thilana, leader of the village.

03:33.479 --> 03:36.243
This is Colonel Mitchell, Teal'c,
Vala and Colonel Carter.

03:36.349 --> 03:39.716
I cannot express our thanks to you
in coming to our aid.

03:39.819 --> 03:41.286
It's our pleasure.

03:41.387 --> 03:42.877
We are at your service.

03:42.989 --> 03:45.549
The building we have selected is this way.
Matar.

03:46.359 --> 03:48.987
- Allow me to carry this.
- Thank you.

03:51.598 --> 03:53.828
Don't you just love helping people?

03:59.239 --> 04:01.230
I hope this location is suitable for you.

04:01.341 --> 04:04.139
I can have the rest of these things
removed, if you'd like.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.178
No, it's great. Thank you.

04:07.847 --> 04:10.543
For years, my ancestors
were forced to record

04:10.650 --> 04:15.781
the true history of our people in secret,
beyond the eyes of the Goa'uld.

04:15.888 --> 04:18.652
This room now houses their legacy.

04:18.758 --> 04:21.352
It seemed appropriate
you do your work here.

04:21.461 --> 04:22.826
I'm flattered.

04:26.599 --> 04:28.464
I must admit, Colonel Carter,

04:28.568 --> 04:32.766
some of my people are concerned about
what this machine will do.

04:33.406 --> 04:35.636
I would like to be able to reassure them.

04:35.742 --> 04:39.178
Yeah, of course.
Let me walk you through it.

04:39.279 --> 04:42.737
Basically, this machine shifts all matter
within a preset range,

04:42.849 --> 04:46.751
in this case the entire village,
into another dimension.

04:46.853 --> 04:49.913
So, when the Prior returns,
he won't be able to see or hear you.

04:50.023 --> 04:52.253
In fact, he'll be able to walk
right through you.

04:52.358 --> 04:54.019
But don't worry, it doesn't hurt at all.

04:54.127 --> 04:57.255
And it is just temporary,
just long enough to fool the Prior.

04:57.363 --> 05:00.730
Once he leaves,
we can put everything back to normal.

05:04.337 --> 05:05.736
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

05:07.974 --> 05:09.464
Sam's all set.

05:09.842 --> 05:12.936
Colonel Reynolds and his team
are standing by at the gate.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.343
Reynolds, this is Mitchell.

05:14.447 --> 05:18.907

<i>radio contact once we go out of phase.</i>

05:19.018 --> 05:19.985
Understood.

05:22.722 --> 05:26.818
Listen up, folks. We're going to try
a little disappearing act here.

05:26.926 --> 05:30.123
Please remember to keep your arms
and legs inside the village at all times,

05:30.229 --> 05:33.062
until we come to
a complete and final stop.

05:33.666 --> 05:35.224
(ALL MURMURING)

05:38.137 --> 05:41.629
Blank stares work, too. Sam, light her up.

05:41.908 --> 05:43.205
Copy that.

05:47.246 --> 05:48.577
(BEAMING)

06:00.259 --> 06:02.352
We have the craziest job in the world.

06:04.263 --> 06:06.197
Dial us out, Lieutenant.

06:14.340 --> 06:15.637
Thank you.

06:17.210 --> 06:21.044
Tonight, we honor our newest friends
from Earth,

06:21.147 --> 06:25.208
whose wisdom, generosity and kindness

06:25.318 --> 06:29.220
have allowed us to resist those
who wished to return us to slavery.

06:29.322 --> 06:33.816
We extend to you our deepest
and most sincere thanks.

06:40.032 --> 06:41.397
(ALL EX CLAIMING)

06:43.703 --> 06:44.931
What was that?

06:45.037 --> 06:48.871
I think the displacement field collapsed.
I'll go check it out.

06:58.985 --> 07:01.215
Okay, I've got some good news
and some bad news.

07:01.320 --> 07:02.309
Good first.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.617
Well, in order to bring everything
back completely,

07:04.724 --> 07:07.591
the machine has to maintain a connection
with every single molecule

07:07.693 --> 07:09.160
that it sends out of phase.

07:09.262 --> 07:12.823
Now, obviously, that requires a lot
of energy, so I implemented a fail-safe

07:12.932 --> 07:15.298
that would automatically bring everything
back into our own dimension

07:15.401 --> 07:17.096
in the event of a power disruption.

07:17.203 --> 07:18.830
And such a disruption occurred?

07:18.938 --> 07:22.135
Well, it was just a slight fluctuation,
but it was enough to trigger the fail-safe.

07:22.241 --> 07:23.208
So what do we do?

07:23.309 --> 07:28.076
Actually, that's the problem.
I thought I'd stabilized the power supply.

07:28.181 --> 07:29.239
Can you fix it?

07:37.824 --> 07:41.089
- You will not abandon us?
- We're not.

07:41.194 --> 07:43.526
But is there a safe place
that you can take your people?

07:43.629 --> 07:46.291
A planet, maybe, you're familiar with?

07:46.799 --> 07:49.461
Won't the Prior find us wherever we go?

07:50.603 --> 07:53.037
MATAR: Then perhaps we should consider
heeding the Prior's wishes.

07:53.139 --> 07:54.106
No.

07:54.540 --> 08:00.274
I will not stand by while we are once again
subjugated into serving false gods.

08:00.379 --> 08:02.347
We must stand our ground.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.443
The Prior is very powerful.

08:05.551 --> 08:08.679
Then, please, you must help us.

08:09.755 --> 08:12.986
- Don't give up on us yet.
- We're not.

08:18.598 --> 08:21.499
- Coffee!
- Thank you.

08:22.001 --> 08:25.459
Don't get too excited.
They packed us decaf by mistake.

08:28.241 --> 08:31.369
Teal'c's gone to the gate
to watch for the Prior.

08:32.478 --> 08:35.447
Look, I hate to rush you, Sam,
but we gotta make a decision about this.

08:35.548 --> 08:38.517
Landry was pretty clear, we're not
to let this thing fall into enemy hands.

08:38.618 --> 08:43.146
I know. I've rigged an Ancient capacitor,
similar to the kind used in the stargates,

08:43.256 --> 08:45.747
between the device and the generators.

08:45.858 --> 08:49.021
It should collect the power
and, hopefully, feed it more evenly.

08:49.128 --> 08:50.493
Well, that sounds great.

08:54.233 --> 08:55.860
Colonel Mitchell, do you read?

08:56.602 --> 08:59.002
Loud and clear, Teal'c. What's up?

08:59.372 --> 09:00.805
Our time.

09:12.885 --> 09:14.250
WOMAN: What is it?

09:14.620 --> 09:16.178
They're checking for the monument.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.517
Sam, we got fighters circling.

09:17.623 --> 09:19.147
How are you coming with
that disappearing act?

09:20.159 --> 09:22.059
Just a few more minutes.

09:24.597 --> 09:26.792
Get these people inside, now.

09:26.899 --> 09:28.526
- Go.
- Not you.

09:29.602 --> 09:32.093
Teal'c, buddy, looks like
we could use you back here now.

09:32.805 --> 09:34.295
I am on my way.

09:53.292 --> 09:54.850
Colonel Mitchell,

09:54.961 --> 09:58.761
an Ori fighter has deposited
a ring platform outside the village.

09:58.864 --> 10:01.128
Now a ground force is headed your way.

10:01.334 --> 10:04.303
All right, this way. Come with me.

10:04.770 --> 10:08.433
- Have you ever fired a gun before?
- No.

10:08.541 --> 10:11.066
All right, blank stares
aren't going to cut it this time.

10:11.177 --> 10:13.168
Listen up. Pull this.

10:14.246 --> 10:16.908
Aim there. Squeeze that.

10:20.152 --> 10:21.141
All right, yeah.

10:21.253 --> 10:23.153
Just make sure that this end
is pointed away from you,

10:23.255 --> 10:25.280
and anyone else you don't want to kill.

10:25.391 --> 10:27.916
Pass these out to whoever wants them.

11:02.561 --> 11:04.392
We can't hold them off forever, you know.

and say, "Hallowed are the Ori,"

will you stop mass murdering

I know you think that everything
that comes out of my mouth is a lie.

I've deceived you too many times
to change that now,

I want you to know that is the truth.

There were real moments between us.
I did fall in love with you.

In your heart, you were a good man,
not because Origin told you to be.

I know you can't possibly like
what you've become,

you still know nothing about me.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.209
Why else would I be here?

17:37.990 --> 17:39.218
If it were up to me,

17:39.324 --> 17:43.556
I would light the fire that would
burn you alive for your desecration.

17:43.829 --> 17:47.526
The only reason you are still here
is because it was so ordered by the Orici.

17:49.535 --> 17:51.230
You will remain in this room.

17:51.336 --> 17:54.237
You will see no one.
You will speak to no one.

17:54.339 --> 17:56.068
You will be educated in the ways of Origin

17:56.175 --> 17:59.008
until such time as
evil no longer possesses you.

17:59.111 --> 18:00.578
No, Tomin.

18:01.613 --> 18:04.173
I'm street-smart. That's always got me by.

18:04.283 --> 18:06.911
But I have to warn you,
I've never been much for school.

18:07.019 --> 18:08.748
I am to teach you.

18:08.854 --> 18:12.187
This is my punishment
for allowing you to deceive me.

18:12.558 --> 18:15.254
If you continue to resist, you will die.

18:28.474 --> 18:29.441
Teal'c.

18:29.541 --> 18:33.170
Thilana, I am happy to see
that you are uninjured.

18:33.278 --> 18:36.145
You as well.
Where is the rest of your team?

18:36.815 --> 18:39.978
- I was hoping that you had seen them.
- I have not.

18:43.522 --> 18:46.116
I have spoken to many others, Thilana.

18:46.725 --> 18:48.920
We have decided that, as village leader,

18:49.027 --> 18:52.190
you must go forward to the Prior
and embrace Origin on our behalf.

18:52.297 --> 18:55.494
What? You have no right.

18:55.601 --> 18:59.401
- You see how powerful they are.
- A poor reason to abandon one's beliefs.

18:59.505 --> 19:01.837
This no longer concerns you.

19:01.940 --> 19:04.500
Your attempts to have us resist
have only led to death.

19:04.610 --> 19:08.273
My concerns extend to those
who would worship false gods.

19:09.648 --> 19:12.048
The Ori are not worthy of your devotion.

19:12.151 --> 19:17.214
Well, gods or not, their power is real.
The same cannot be said for your people.

19:17.322 --> 19:21.725
You pledged to protect us, but
when the time came, you failed to do so.

19:22.895 --> 19:24.692
We have no choice.

19:24.796 --> 19:29.460
We shall bow down to the Ori and beg
for their mercy or we shall all perish.

19:37.943 --> 19:39.069
It's getting worse?

19:40.746 --> 19:41.974
Not getting better.

19:43.448 --> 19:45.814
- Listen, I've been thinking...
- Uh-oh.

19:45.918 --> 19:48.546
Yeah. Dangerous, I know.

19:49.955 --> 19:53.516
I can leave the field
and still stay out of phase, right?

19:54.493 --> 19:58.486
So, I was thinking I'd take some C4,
plant it around the village,

19:59.364 --> 20:02.333
come back here,
use the explosions as a distraction to...

20:02.434 --> 20:04.902
What?
You haven't heard the rest of the plan.

20:05.003 --> 20:07.130
You can't leave the device here.

20:07.239 --> 20:09.408
Well, I was going to save some C4
for that as well.

20:09.408 --> 20:09.874
Well, I was going to save some C4
for that as well.

20:09.975 --> 20:13.376
You cannot sacrifice the device for me.

20:13.478 --> 20:15.639
It's still our best chance against the Ori.

20:15.747 --> 20:19.444
No offense, but that gizmo's not showing
a whole lot of promise right now.

20:19.551 --> 20:23.146
It'll work. I just wasn't ready for this.

20:24.423 --> 20:26.118
I'm probably not going to make it
either way.

20:26.225 --> 20:29.786
No. Don't you start to talk like that.

20:31.597 --> 20:36.261
Cam, we have to face the fact
that I am going to die here.

20:36.368 --> 20:40.805
No, I don't have to face that fact,
because I am not going to let it happen.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.771
I appreciate that.

20:44.843 --> 20:46.708
But the truth is,

20:46.812 --> 20:51.044
even if you manage to create a distraction
and destroy the device,

20:51.149 --> 20:53.379
you are never going to get me
to the gate by yourself.

20:53.485 --> 20:56.454
- Yes, I will.
- Not alive.

21:04.229 --> 21:07.824
"So it came to pass that Ver Omesh
was gripped by a great famine.

21:07.933 --> 21:12.700
"So Markon went to the prophet Articus
and asked to go to the forest for food."

21:12.804 --> 21:15.102
How many people have you killed?

21:16.308 --> 21:21.109
Do you keep track?
Put little notches in your Ori belt?

21:22.281 --> 21:26.547
"The prophet bade him be patient,
for the Ori provide for all who have faith.

21:26.652 --> 21:28.017
"But Markon did not believe."

21:28.120 --> 21:30.213
Do you remember their faces?

21:31.423 --> 21:33.653
Or are there too many of them?

21:37.095 --> 21:38.323
Hundreds?

21:39.965 --> 21:41.296
Thousands?

21:43.135 --> 21:45.296
"So the prophet drew a line in the sand,
and told him,

21:45.404 --> 21:48.373
"'Step across,
and you may do as you wish.'

21:48.473 --> 21:53.501
"So Markon did, and left the village,
and feasted on wild berries."

21:53.612 --> 21:56.206
What about the stories in there
that are all about not...

21:56.315 --> 21:57.577
Enough!

21:59.151 --> 22:01.483
They were each given a chance
to save themselves.

22:01.586 --> 22:03.520
Those who do not walk the path
are not worthy.

22:03.622 --> 22:04.646
You can preach all you want to me, Tomin,

22:04.756 --> 22:05.848
but I know that's not what you believe.

22:05.957 --> 22:07.549
"The fruit was bitter
and did not satisfy him.

22:07.659 --> 22:09.183
"He longed to return to the village,

22:09.294 --> 22:11.854
"but found that the line had widened
to a great chasm."

22:11.963 --> 22:14.454
I've read the book. I've read it.

22:14.566 --> 22:16.193
I understand why you think
it's so important.

22:16.301 --> 22:17.666
The words give you comfort,
and, at face value,

22:17.769 --> 22:20.203
it appears to be as if they're trying
to inspire the best out of people.

22:20.305 --> 22:22.273
"He called out to the prophet in fear,
but the prophet said,

22:22.374 --> 22:23.466
"'The line has not changed."'

22:23.575 --> 22:25.338
- Honesty, morality...
- "It is you who have changed.

22:25.444 --> 22:29.175
- "Step across if you truly believe..."
- This whole crusade is a manipulation.

22:29.281 --> 22:31.545
Nothing in there says that those who
don't believe should be massacred.

22:31.650 --> 22:33.311
"So Markon prayed for forgiveness,
and took the first step."

22:33.418 --> 22:34.407
Where does it say that, Tomin?

22:34.519 --> 22:36.544
- Where does it say that?
- "And the hands of the Ori enveloped..."

22:36.655 --> 22:38.418
The Ori are not gods.

22:38.523 --> 22:39.490
(GRUNTS)

22:49.101 --> 22:51.001
You should kill me now.

23:04.149 --> 23:08.552
There is a building in the village square
that disappeared upon our arrival.

23:08.653 --> 23:11.952
You will tell me what trickery
is being used to conceal it.

23:17.629 --> 23:21.190
I am Thilana, leader of this village.

23:22.334 --> 23:25.030
We do not know what magic is at work.

23:25.737 --> 23:29.764
But it strikes me
by your asking us lowly peasants.

23:29.875 --> 23:35.279
You are saying that the great power
of the Ori cannot see past such deception?

23:35.380 --> 23:41.785
I ask you so that you may show the Ori
the error of your ways.

23:42.654 --> 23:47.421
If you do not bow, your village
will be burned to the ground.

23:53.832 --> 23:55.424
- Wait!
- Matar, no.

23:56.435 --> 24:00.303
She would stand by while
more of our people are murdered?

24:00.405 --> 24:03.374
To protect the identities of those
who have failed us?

24:03.475 --> 24:05.238
What do you speak of?

24:07.946 --> 24:10.437
This man is not of our village.

24:11.550 --> 24:14.951
He came with the others
to try to conceal us.

24:32.404 --> 24:35.100
You have served the Ori well, my friend.

24:37.576 --> 24:39.066
Seize him!

24:43.682 --> 24:46.014
Both of them as well.

24:57.996 --> 25:00.089
Forgive me for striking you.

25:02.167 --> 25:06.900
Hitting me is nothing compared to the
lives that you mercilessly extinguished.

25:08.006 --> 25:10.099
You can never make up for that, Tomin.

25:10.775 --> 25:14.370
I thought that I could save you,
but I realize now it's too late.

25:14.479 --> 25:17.812
Yes, it is. You'll never see me again.

25:17.916 --> 25:19.383
One last story

25:20.785 --> 25:21.979
from me.

25:24.389 --> 25:29.122
A long time ago, some people
just like you and me, over time, evolved,

25:29.227 --> 25:31.058
and they became so advanced
that they figured out

25:31.162 --> 25:35.861
how to turn themselves into energy,
and ascend to a higher plane of existence.

25:35.967 --> 25:39.994
I know, it sounds crazy,

25:41.172 --> 25:43.037
but it happened.

25:43.141 --> 25:46.668
Then they discovered that
if regular humans worshipped them,

25:46.778 --> 25:49.212
that made them more powerful.

25:49.314 --> 25:53.910
So they used their knowledge
to make as many people as they could,

25:54.019 --> 25:57.887
and then created a religion that would
force them to prostrate in their name.

25:57.989 --> 26:00.389
The more prostrating, the more power.

26:00.492 --> 26:04.292
The religion said that these beings
were benevolent,

26:04.396 --> 26:06.296
but they couldn't offer
their followers ascension

26:06.398 --> 26:08.161
because that would mean
they'd have to share their power.

26:08.266 --> 26:11.531
They'd just use people up
and throw them away.

26:11.636 --> 26:14.662
I know I'll never convince you otherwise,

26:14.773 --> 26:18.732
but everything you believe is a lie.

26:36.261 --> 26:38.855
Tell me what you know.

26:54.412 --> 26:57.575
Please, Prior, we were misled.

26:57.682 --> 27:00.742
The outsiders tried to convince us
the Ori were false gods.

27:00.852 --> 27:02.786
- Matar.
- Forgive us,

27:02.887 --> 27:07.824
for we are now ready to embrace
the teachings of Origin with open hearts.

27:07.926 --> 27:09.154
Tell me.

27:09.260 --> 27:13.196
Do you know how the outsiders
have concealed themselves?

27:20.305 --> 27:21.795
This is not good.

27:24.342 --> 27:25.434
Hey.

27:27.379 --> 27:30.871
Carter, wake up. No sleeping.

27:33.785 --> 27:37.448
- My laptop. There's a file.
- You want me to get it?

27:41.426 --> 27:45.055
In my personal directory. Letters, mostly.

27:45.864 --> 27:46.922
Sam.

27:48.266 --> 27:52.828
One to Cassie and some other people.

27:55.206 --> 27:56.571
Password's "fishing."

27:59.310 --> 28:00.368
See?

28:04.816 --> 28:07.876
Now you're going to have to
change the password.

28:09.621 --> 28:13.057
Sam, don't give up on me.

28:14.225 --> 28:15.715
You've got to think of my position here.

28:15.827 --> 28:19.126
I worked my ass off to get this team
back together. Now we've lost...

28:21.466 --> 28:23.434
Well, we've lost Jackson.

28:24.669 --> 28:26.432
I can't lose you, too.

28:28.740 --> 28:31.766
I've spent my entire life
dedicated to science.

28:33.678 --> 28:39.412
The last 10 years trying to convince people
they believed in false gods.

28:41.820 --> 28:44.050
I don't feel like
science is going to help me.

28:46.424 --> 28:47.755
Right now,

28:48.727 --> 28:53.528
I'm just hoping that, somewhere,
one of those gods...

28:59.471 --> 29:04.670
My grandma used to say,
"God is like a prairie windstorm.

29:05.810 --> 29:07.835
"If you look too hard,
you get dust in your eyes,

29:07.946 --> 29:10.574
"but there's still plenty of ways
you know it's there."

29:10.682 --> 29:12.650
Is that what you believe?

29:13.151 --> 29:16.052
I generally just nodded
until she gave me a macaroon.

29:16.454 --> 29:17.716
(CHUCKLES)

29:20.125 --> 29:24.221
There is one thing that I do know is true.

29:25.730 --> 29:28.255
The mind is a powerful thing.

29:29.067 --> 29:30.625
No matter who or what you believe in,

29:30.735 --> 29:34.535
sometimes belief itself
makes all the difference in the world.

29:35.940 --> 29:37.805
You just don't give up.

29:39.644 --> 29:42.112
Tell yourself whatever you have to.

29:43.248 --> 29:45.648
Just believe you're going to make it, Sam.

29:50.555 --> 29:51.954
Crap.

30:29.727 --> 30:32.389
Guess your little bag of tricks
don't work on us, huh?

30:34.032 --> 30:37.195
Show yourself
or this village will be destroyed.

30:50.215 --> 30:52.080
Score one for science.

31:05.463 --> 31:09.695
Prior, I beg forgiveness for my failure
in teaching the mother of the Orici.

31:09.801 --> 31:12.497
You have only just begun, Tomin.

31:12.604 --> 31:15.368
Please allow me to recuse myself.
She is intolerable.

31:15.473 --> 31:17.065
I fear I will be of no further use.

31:17.175 --> 31:19.473
My skills are much better spent
as a commander.

31:19.577 --> 31:20.839
Indeed.

31:20.945 --> 31:26.406
You have proven yourself a ruthless
and skillful warrior and a fine leader.

31:26.517 --> 31:28.417
Thank you.
I'll head straight back down to the planet.

31:28.519 --> 31:31.545
That won't be necessary.
We are done here.

31:31.656 --> 31:33.453
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

31:33.558 --> 31:37.187
- The village will be destroyed.
- Why?

31:37.295 --> 31:42.858
They have been touched by evil.
There is no salvation for them.

31:42.967 --> 31:45.060
But we eliminated all of the unbelievers.

31:45.169 --> 31:46.500
Not all of them.

31:46.604 --> 31:49.004
I thought the village had capitulated.
If you'll allow me...

31:49.107 --> 31:53.806
Markon walked away from the Ori
to satisfy his hunger,

31:53.912 --> 31:58.440
but no matter how much he ate,
he did not feel full.

31:59.951 --> 32:05.082
Realizing his mistake,
he ran back to the Ori,

32:05.189 --> 32:10.354
but they denied his pleas and struck down
the village that welcomed him back.

32:10.461 --> 32:14.124
Forgive me, Prior, but I was reviewing
that very passage just this morning.

32:14.232 --> 32:16.894
Markon prayed for forgiveness
and took the first step...

32:17.001 --> 32:22.462
And the hands of the Ori enveloped
all those who welcomed him back.

32:23.608 --> 32:26.702
The village was destroyed.

32:26.811 --> 32:31.714
All those who stand by and
accept transgressions must be punished.

32:32.951 --> 32:35.920
That is not the implication
of the text, Prior.

32:36.020 --> 32:39.478
The Ori granted forgiveness
when Markon realized his mistake,

32:39.590 --> 32:43.117
and blessed the village with their light
for showing him the way back to the path.

32:43.227 --> 32:46.924
You dare question my judgment?

32:47.765 --> 32:49.392
No, it's just not how I was taught.

32:49.500 --> 32:53.800
There are many words, but only one truth.

33:01.913 --> 33:05.007
They're going to clear out
and bomb the village from orbit.

33:09.988 --> 33:13.549
I reckon we'll be okay.

33:13.658 --> 33:18.186
The device will be preserved, and they'll
go away thinking they've wiped us out.

33:19.464 --> 33:21.591
But they're going to kill all those people.

33:22.700 --> 33:24.167
I know.

33:24.802 --> 33:26.997
So what are we going to do about it?

33:33.611 --> 33:34.805
Teal'c.

33:36.447 --> 33:38.210
I'm so sorry.

33:39.350 --> 33:42.615
I told the Prior of the device.

33:42.720 --> 33:44.381
He decreed that
the village will be destroyed

33:44.489 --> 33:46.548
if your friends do not show themselves.

33:54.732 --> 33:56.131
Stand aside, Thilana.

33:56.234 --> 33:58.168
What do you think you're doing?

33:58.269 --> 34:02.706
He must be sacrificed to show the Ori
we are not allied with them.

34:02.807 --> 34:05.037
You will do no such thing.

34:05.143 --> 34:08.544
If you stand in the way,
you, too, will be shown no mercy.

34:17.088 --> 34:20.216
So what we've got to do is we have
to expand the field around the village

34:20.324 --> 34:21.985
just for a little while.

34:22.093 --> 34:23.754
There's not enough power.

34:23.861 --> 34:26.989
Carter, come on!
There's got to be something.

34:27.698 --> 34:28.665
(GROANS)

34:28.833 --> 34:31.768
Hang on, hang on.
I'll get you some morphine.

34:39.010 --> 34:42.207
Wait. I need to think clearly.

34:43.648 --> 34:45.172
There might still be a way.

34:45.783 --> 34:51.016
Matar, killing Teal'c will prove nothing.

34:51.622 --> 34:55.888
If these gods are truly worthy of
our devotion, then pray to them.

34:56.727 --> 35:03.189
No god should ever ask you to kill
an innocent man to prove your sanctity.

35:05.770 --> 35:07.601
I know you're afraid.

35:08.606 --> 35:09.937
We all are.

35:11.209 --> 35:14.042
But if you are going to die,

35:14.145 --> 35:21.074
let us die in noble peace
and truth of spirit.

35:40.438 --> 35:42.838
TOMIN: Why do they not
reveal themselves?

35:52.283 --> 35:54.945
- Who?
- Your friends.

35:56.087 --> 35:58.920
They're concealing a building
on the planet's surface.

35:59.023 --> 36:02.459
The Prior plans to destroy the village
because of them.

36:02.560 --> 36:04.892
Hundreds will die
because of your friends' treachery.

36:04.996 --> 36:08.397
- Innocent people.
- Yes.

36:09.400 --> 36:11.960
- You're not happy about that.
- No.

36:16.073 --> 36:17.506
He twisted the meaning.

36:19.443 --> 36:21.411
- Who?
- The Prior.

36:22.480 --> 36:26.849
He changed the meaning of the story
of Markon to suit the situation,

36:26.951 --> 36:29.181
to justify killing the villagers.

36:30.755 --> 36:33.417
Well, if you think that's wrong,
you should do something about it.

36:33.524 --> 36:34.616
He's a Prior.

36:34.725 --> 36:36.625
Tomin, those people down there
don't have to die,

36:36.727 --> 36:40.128
and you're the only one
who can do something about it.

36:49.807 --> 36:51.069
You want to use this?

36:52.443 --> 36:55.207
The power crystal in Merlin's device
was depleted.

36:56.314 --> 36:59.112
That's why we needed
the naquadah generators.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.685
I'm sorry, is that not apples and oranges?

37:01.786 --> 37:04.380
Ancient and Ori technology is similar.

37:05.189 --> 37:07.248
We could make it work for a short time.

37:08.726 --> 37:12.253
All right. So, what do I do?

37:12.897 --> 37:15.127
Put the crystal in the back of the device.

37:20.438 --> 37:21.405
Got it.

37:22.540 --> 37:24.531
It's too big. It doesn't fit.

37:25.343 --> 37:28.403
- Power interface adapter.
- What?

37:28.512 --> 37:31.675
Connector. Generator to Ancient tech.

37:31.949 --> 37:32.973
(SIGHING)

37:33.084 --> 37:34.779
Carter! Carter.

37:35.586 --> 37:37.986
You've had a lot of morphine.

37:38.089 --> 37:42.583
So I want you to explain it to me
so that it makes sense.

37:46.897 --> 37:50.355
- Excuse me, Prior.
- Come in, Tomin.

37:50.468 --> 37:54.131
It is good that you have seen
your way clear.

37:54.238 --> 37:57.435
Hallowed are those who walk in unison.

37:57.541 --> 38:01.602
Forgive me, Prior, but I am still troubled.
I believe we are in error.

38:01.712 --> 38:04.772
The people of the village have expressed
a willingness to seek the truth.

38:04.882 --> 38:06.611
I believe they are in earnest.

38:06.717 --> 38:11.552
Do not the Ori wish all who seek
their wisdom to follow the path?

38:11.656 --> 38:13.590
I'm disappointed, Tomin.

38:14.125 --> 38:18.653
It seems that you have begun
to question the will of the Ori.

38:18.763 --> 38:24.201
Or is it the unbeliever under your tutelage
that has corrupted you?

38:24.302 --> 38:27.999
No, I have not begun to question
the will of the Ori,

38:28.105 --> 38:31.472
but I have begun to question
the interpretation of their words.

38:31.575 --> 38:33.566
No matter what you say, I will not believe

38:33.678 --> 38:36.806
the <i>Book of Origin</i> asks us
to massacre innocent people,

38:36.914 --> 38:40.611
and I will not stand by while
the holy doctrine of good will and faith

38:40.718 --> 38:42.652
that I have sworn to uphold

38:42.753 --> 38:45.813
is twisted into a hammer
and used to beat people down!

38:45.923 --> 38:48.118
How dare you?

38:54.632 --> 38:55.690
(EX CLAIMS)

38:56.500 --> 38:58.434
That's a good sign.

38:58.536 --> 39:01.835
That's easy for you to say,
you with the little flesh wound.

39:03.307 --> 39:06.834
- All right, what next?
- Laptop.

39:17.655 --> 39:18.644
(MOANS)

39:18.756 --> 39:20.951
- You okay?
- No.

39:21.525 --> 39:22.719
Right.

39:25.896 --> 39:30.424
Behold, the hand of the Ori at work.

39:40.177 --> 39:41.144
What happened?

39:41.245 --> 39:42.303
- Come with me.
- Let go of me.

39:42.413 --> 39:45.109
The Prior destroyed the village.
There was nothing I could do.

39:45.216 --> 39:48.117
Now keep silent, please,
for both our sakes.

39:58.629 --> 40:00.062
The ship is about to break orbit.

40:00.164 --> 40:03.759
They'll probably kill me for this, but
I'm going to ring you down to the planet.

40:03.868 --> 40:08.396
- Come with me. Please, Tomin.
- You're right, I still love you.

40:08.973 --> 40:10.304
Then come.

40:16.881 --> 40:19.679
- This is all that I can do.
- No, Tomin, you can do more.

40:19.784 --> 40:21.012
(BEEPING)

40:44.542 --> 40:45.804
Hello?

40:48.245 --> 40:49.678
Anyone?

40:53.584 --> 40:55.381
Vala Mal Doran.

41:00.090 --> 41:04.151
Colonel Carter was able to expand
the range of the device in time.

41:04.595 --> 41:07.086
Colonel Mitchell. Vala Mal Doran is here.

41:08.332 --> 41:10.459
That's good news.
Do we know if that ship has left?

41:11.068 --> 41:13.764
- As far as I know, it has.
<i>- Okay.</i>

41:13.871 --> 41:17.807
Look, Carter's in bad shape.
We need a med team here right away.

41:30.054 --> 41:31.385
Hey there.

41:32.990 --> 41:34.890
- You're looking better.
- CARTER: Thanks.

41:34.992 --> 41:37.187
A few more weeks
and I should be back in action.

41:37.294 --> 41:39.524
Yeah. No, I don't want to rush you.

41:39.630 --> 41:43.361
- Listen, Cam...
- Sam, don't say a word.

41:47.171 --> 41:48.365
Here.

41:49.573 --> 41:51.666
I baked you some macaroons.

41:52.176 --> 41:55.145
- You baked them?
- Yeah, Grandma's recipe.

41:55.246 --> 41:58.215
- Wow. Thanks.
- Go on, try one.

42:02.019 --> 42:04.783
You know what? Maybe a little later.

42:04.889 --> 42:08.689
- You don't like macaroons?
- It's just that I'm still a little queasy.

42:09.426 --> 42:13.988
Well, try one. They'll make you feel better.
Here, I'll get you a good one.

42:21.872 --> 42:23.464
Pretty good, huh?

42:25.476 --> 42:28.001
Actually, they are pretty good.

42:30.447 --> 42:34.213
- You hate it.
- Yeah. Sorry.

42:38.756 --> 42:40.724
Well, to each their own.

42:43.494 --> 42:44.586
Thank you.
