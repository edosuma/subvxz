WEBVTT

00:13.046 --> 00:15.047
Man:
<i>Welcome to the premiere,</i>

00:15.049 --> 00:18.050
<i>Where every player's a star.</i>

00:18.052 --> 00:22.454
(slot machine tunes playing,
tokens clinking)

00:22.456 --> 00:25.758
Man: <i>All right,</i>
<i>lucky number seven, here we go!</i>

00:28.161 --> 00:29.395
Dealer:
<i>Player has blackjack!</i>

00:29.397 --> 00:31.730
(players cheer)

00:31.732 --> 00:32.731
Croupier:
<i>No more bets.</i>

00:32.733 --> 00:33.732
<i>Roll seven.</i>

00:33.734 --> 00:35.134
(roulette wheel spinning)

00:35.136 --> 00:37.202
Man: <i>Come on, red, big money.</i>
<i>Come on!</i>

00:37.204 --> 00:38.504
(applause and cheering)

00:45.612 --> 00:48.480
(indistinct chatter
on police radio)

00:51.251 --> 00:52.684
Sanders:
What do you think, dave?

00:52.686 --> 00:55.788
Blunt force trauma
to the back of the skull.

00:55.790 --> 01:00.492
And her liver temp tells me
she's been dead about two hours.

01:00.494 --> 01:03.462
I.D.?

01:03.464 --> 01:05.397
No purse, no cell phone.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.799
Nothing.

01:08.535 --> 01:10.302
That is an elaborate model.

01:10.304 --> 01:11.570
Must be a story there, huh?

01:11.572 --> 01:13.539
The premiere?
Yeah.

01:13.541 --> 01:15.574
It was jack witten's dream.

01:15.576 --> 01:18.143
In jack witten's house.

01:18.145 --> 01:20.579
Well, that's because
it was never built.

01:20.581 --> 01:23.415
I could write a book
about the vegas that never was.

01:23.417 --> 01:26.585
So many casinos were imagined
and never realized.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.720
The most legendary of all,
the premiere.

01:28.722 --> 01:30.689
It was

01:30.691 --> 01:32.591
Jack witten's vision
to build a casino

01:32.593 --> 01:35.094
That resembled his father's
old hollywood movie studio.

01:35.096 --> 01:36.728
What happened?
Well, like in the movies,

01:36.730 --> 01:39.698
The dream ended in scandal.

01:39.700 --> 01:43.635
Jack witten lost his investors
when he became the prime suspect

01:43.637 --> 01:46.105
In the murder of a young woman.

01:46.107 --> 01:48.707
And here we are again.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.709
Nice house.

01:50.711 --> 01:51.877
Who lives here?

01:51.879 --> 01:53.879
Brass: Jack witten.
He's an odd duck.

01:53.881 --> 01:55.714
He's a modern-day
howard hughes.

01:55.716 --> 01:57.749
That's him,
right over there.

01:57.751 --> 01:59.618
A former party boy
turned recluse.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.386
Said he was downstairs
in the screening room,

02:01.388 --> 02:03.689
Fell asleep, came up,
found the girl.

02:03.691 --> 02:06.558
Tried to revive her.
Called 911.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.560
Any sign of a break-in?
No.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.429
Just some wine bottles
and drug paraphernalia.

02:10.431 --> 02:12.464
You know, it's weird.
14 years ago,

02:12.466 --> 02:14.800
We had the guy
for the same crime.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.301
It's déjà vu
all over again.

02:16.303 --> 02:17.903
Why? What happened?

02:17.905 --> 02:20.572
We didn't have enough
evidence to make an arrest.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.708
Powerful guy? Connected?
Back then.

02:22.710 --> 02:24.910
Not anymore. Now he's shuffling
around in his slippers.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.645
Hey.
Hi.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.480
It's, uh, pretty
ugly in there.

02:28.482 --> 02:29.915
Have you seen sara?

02:29.917 --> 02:32.784
Thought she was with you.

02:57.644 --> 03:00.245
I think we got
the son of a bitch.

03:00.247 --> 03:01.747
This had to come from
jack witten's house.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.382
It should be enough
for a warrant.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.684
Guy like witten--
might not be that easy.

03:05.686 --> 03:06.952
What do you mean?

03:06.954 --> 03:10.355
This is vegas, sara.

03:10.357 --> 03:13.659
Russell:
<i>Sara? Sara.</i>

03:15.495 --> 03:17.663
Got something?

03:17.665 --> 03:20.499
A piece of the past.
Yeah, I heard

03:20.501 --> 03:22.434
About this witten guy.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.503
Are you thinking
that the strand has something

03:24.505 --> 03:26.238
To do
with the crime scene downstairs?

03:26.240 --> 03:28.740
Well, 14 years ago...

03:28.742 --> 03:30.909
I think the crime
scene was right here.

03:33.413 --> 03:35.681
Tell me about her.
Who-who was she?

03:35.683 --> 03:38.383
Darcy blaine. 18.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.819
Jack witten
picked her up at a bar.

03:40.821 --> 03:43.288
Security cameras caught
them leaving together.

03:43.290 --> 03:45.357
He had a thing
for younger girls.

03:45.359 --> 03:47.826
Darcy was never seen again.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.261
They never found her body.

03:49.263 --> 03:51.797
You think she was murdered
in this room?

03:51.799 --> 03:55.601
It was my first
high-profile case in vegas.

03:55.603 --> 03:59.238
Catherine was supervising
in grissom's absence.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.572
I got it.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.307
Witten's the one who got away.

04:02.309 --> 04:05.677
I've spent a lot of time
with darcy's family.

04:05.679 --> 04:07.446
She was a troubled, wild kid

04:07.448 --> 04:09.581
Who never had a chance
to find her way.

04:09.583 --> 04:13.852
But we do have a girl that was
killed in this house tonight,

04:13.854 --> 04:16.521
So, let's focus on that, okay?

04:16.523 --> 04:18.991
Yeah, I am.

04:18.993 --> 04:22.861
I-I have waited a long time
to get into this room.

04:22.863 --> 04:25.397
And that girl downstairs
might still be alive,

04:25.399 --> 04:28.667
If we put witten
away 14 years ago.

04:35.375 --> 04:37.976
♪ who... Are you?

04:37.978 --> 04:41.380

05:05.305 --> 05:08.607
So this guy jack witten
is a movie fanatic.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.909
Let's see what was
playing last night.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.878
Okay. Fade in.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.346
I'm jack witten.

05:14.348 --> 05:16.748
Welcome to my sleazy sex pad.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.384
Glass of wine?
Why not?

05:19.386 --> 05:20.619
Glass of wine, little romance...

05:20.621 --> 05:22.954
But I get too frisky.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.089
You push me away...

05:24.091 --> 05:25.957
<i>And drop your wine glass.</i>

05:31.597 --> 05:32.931
Hmm.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.599
Little bits

05:34.601 --> 05:35.934
Of cork in there.
Hmm.

05:35.936 --> 05:38.970
Nice bottle of wine.

05:38.972 --> 05:41.039
Did the cork break?

05:41.941 --> 05:44.343
Nope. Still intact.

05:44.345 --> 05:47.412
Weird.
Where'd that come from?

05:47.414 --> 05:49.481
I don't know.
Okay, so...

05:49.483 --> 05:51.116
Date is over,
I'm out of here.

05:51.118 --> 05:52.984
That's the problem.

05:52.986 --> 05:55.687
Finlay: <i>So witten</i>
<i>and the girl struggle,</i>

05:55.689 --> 05:57.889
<i>Girl breaks free...</i>

05:58.858 --> 06:00.559
<i>Good night.</i>

06:02.028 --> 06:06.765
Blood on the lamp is consistent
with blunt force trauma.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.967
No castoff,

06:08.969 --> 06:10.836
Which means
it was one blow.
Okay, so,

06:10.838 --> 06:13.805
Witten kills the girl,
calls 911, and then,

06:13.807 --> 06:15.941
Plays it off
like an intruder came in

06:15.943 --> 06:19.911
Yeah, and that is the
worst alibi ever, which,

06:19.913 --> 06:22.681
In my experience,
sometimes means that it's true.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.783
What do you mean?
Well, didn't you say

06:24.785 --> 06:28.587
That this guy killed a girl
and made her body disappear?

06:28.589 --> 06:30.422
Why didn't he just do it again?

06:30.424 --> 06:34.426
Maybe now he thinks
he's untouchable.

06:34.428 --> 06:37.028
Seems like old times.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.430
Right, conrad?

06:38.432 --> 06:41.800
Some ways, yes,
some ways, no... Jack.

06:41.802 --> 06:44.136
Uh, mr. Witten, I'm-I'm not
so interested in the past

06:44.138 --> 06:46.138
As I am in what happened
last night.

06:46.140 --> 06:48.006
I already told you.

06:48.008 --> 06:50.976
I was watching a film
in my basement screening room.

06:50.978 --> 06:52.811
Fell asleep to jane russell,

06:52.813 --> 06:55.914
<i>Woke up to a horror show.</i>

06:55.916 --> 06:58.550
And you didn't
hear anything upstairs?

06:58.552 --> 07:00.452
Screening room's soundproofed.

07:00.454 --> 07:01.953
And the girl?

07:01.955 --> 07:04.523
Never saw her before.

07:04.525 --> 07:05.957
Ecklie:
I'm so sorry, sir.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.827
I just need this to be clear.
You're saying that you never

07:08.829 --> 07:10.662
Even met darcy?
Did I stutter?

07:10.664 --> 07:12.531
You heard me.

07:12.533 --> 07:15.066
And this time, you people
aren't going to find me

07:15.068 --> 07:19.971
Wasted on some b.S.
Security video outside a club.

07:19.973 --> 07:22.207
Well, we may not
have video on you, but...

07:22.209 --> 07:24.142
We do have blood
on your hands, sir.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.811
Ecklie:
Yeah, the victim's blood.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.913
How do you explain that?
I tried to help her.

07:27.915 --> 07:29.714
I got her blood on my hands.

07:29.716 --> 07:31.550
What do you want me to do?

07:31.552 --> 07:33.018
I won't play the sap for you.

07:33.020 --> 07:35.020
Humphrey bogart...

07:35.022 --> 07:37.189
<i>Maltese falcon,</i> right?

07:37.191 --> 07:39.124
You know it.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.725
A kindred spirit.

07:40.727 --> 07:42.093
Russell:
He played sam spade,

07:42.095 --> 07:44.129
A private eye
everybody was lying to.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.997
Ecklie: Yeah, that's me.
You've been lying

07:45.999 --> 07:48.033
For 14 years.

07:48.035 --> 07:50.602
You brought
this little girl home,

07:50.604 --> 07:52.471
Just like you did darcy blaine.

07:52.473 --> 07:55.140
You know it,
and I know it.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.843
You don't know anything.

07:57.845 --> 08:00.745
You sure as hell
don't know me.

08:00.747 --> 08:03.014
You never did.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.816
Keep smiling, jack.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.818
We didn't get
you for darcy,

08:06.820 --> 08:08.854
But I promise you

08:08.856 --> 08:11.790
We're gonna nail you
for this one.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.137
Sidle:
Hello, conrad.

08:26.139 --> 08:28.673
Sara.

08:28.675 --> 08:31.676
Here to pull
the darcy blaine case files?

08:31.678 --> 08:34.513
Looks like you
beat me to it.

08:34.515 --> 08:35.780
Well,
great minds obsess alike.

08:35.782 --> 08:37.782
Yeah, well, I got a
hunch we're obsessing

08:37.784 --> 08:38.783
For different reasons.

08:38.785 --> 08:41.753
Huh. You're right.

08:42.990 --> 08:47.692
I should never have taken
this case away from you guys.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.794
You can't do this, conrad.
Yes, I can.

08:49.796 --> 08:50.962
Grissom is at a conference,

08:50.964 --> 08:52.130
And you don't have
the authority,

08:52.132 --> 08:54.132
So this case belongs
to day shift now.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.868
To me.
So you just decided
to stop looking at jack witten.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.304
At least let us get a warrant
for witten's house.
No!

08:59.306 --> 09:00.872
I'm not gonna waste
valuable time

09:00.874 --> 09:02.307
And resources
on a witch hunt

09:02.309 --> 09:04.609
Of a prominent man
whose family has done so much

09:04.611 --> 09:06.111
For this town.
God, you are so political.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.113
Well, that's an understatement.

09:08.115 --> 09:10.215
Look, darcy blaine
was a drug-addict rich girl

09:10.217 --> 09:11.883
Slumming in northtown.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.052
You've been looking
in the wrong place, sidle,

09:14.054 --> 09:17.956
And you let her-- it's time
the real pros took over.

09:17.958 --> 09:19.958
Feels like a lifetime ago.

09:19.960 --> 09:23.194
I was looking in the wrong place
or not looking at all.

09:24.797 --> 09:27.566
Security cam photos--
witten and darcy

09:27.568 --> 09:29.834
Leaving the club.

09:29.836 --> 09:32.170
Later on,
in the parking garage.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.139
Sidle: They drove away
together in her car.

09:34.141 --> 09:36.308
Next morning, it was found
on the edge of town.

09:36.310 --> 09:37.676
Trace on her tires

09:37.678 --> 09:39.978
Said it was driven up
to mount charleston.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.180
Notorious body-dump site.

09:42.182 --> 09:46.351
Exemplar from darcy's father
proved it was hers.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.119
Yeah, and her blood
tested positive

09:48.121 --> 09:49.854
For cocaine and ghb, so she was

09:49.856 --> 09:51.823
Definitely roofied.

09:51.825 --> 09:54.993
So what do you think happened
that night?

09:54.995 --> 09:56.628
Well...

09:56.630 --> 09:58.930
Darcy blaine was <i>a drug addict.</i>

09:58.932 --> 10:01.266
<i>I think that witten lured her</i>
<i>to his place</i>

10:01.268 --> 10:04.302
<i>With the promise of drugs,</i>
<i>and then he drugged her.</i>

10:06.138 --> 10:08.006
<i>Witten brought her upstairs.</i>

10:08.008 --> 10:09.608
<i>Darcy was out of it, but still</i>

10:09.610 --> 10:11.643
She had some fight left in her.
(darcy grunts)

10:13.079 --> 10:15.780
(grunts)
<i>he kills her.</i>

10:15.782 --> 10:18.683
<i>Witten takes darcy's body out</i>
<i>in her car</i>

10:18.685 --> 10:21.319
<i>And buries her somewhere</i>
<i>near mount charleston.</i>

10:21.321 --> 10:24.189
<i>He made one mistake.</i>

10:24.191 --> 10:27.025
<i>He left a carpet fiber</i>
<i>in the trunk.</i>

10:27.027 --> 10:29.027
Still bloody
after all these years.

10:29.029 --> 10:30.862
And...

10:30.864 --> 10:34.799
The carpet fiber
I took from witten's bedroom.

10:34.801 --> 10:38.169
You just get that?
Uh-huh.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.772
That looks damn close.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.907
Hopefully, hodges can confirm.

10:47.913 --> 10:49.180
Hey.
Hey.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.182
I got a hit
on the prints.

10:51.184 --> 10:54.152
Jane doe from
jack witten's house

10:54.154 --> 10:56.721
Is gwenn onetta.

10:56.723 --> 10:59.257
18. High school dropout.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.326
Three drug arrests
in the last year.

11:01.328 --> 11:05.130
Jack witten's specialty--
young, vulnerable addicts.

11:05.132 --> 11:07.732
God, this guy's really gotten
under everybody's skin.

11:07.734 --> 11:10.435
It's not so much the guy,
it's the loss.

11:10.437 --> 11:12.871
Grissom assembled
an all-star team here.

11:12.873 --> 11:15.140
But ask any pro athlete.

11:15.142 --> 11:17.776
Most wins feel the same.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.944
It's the tough losses
that haunt you.

11:19.946 --> 11:22.313
So, this is a rematch.

11:22.315 --> 11:25.283
Yeah.
I like it.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.255
Chip of glass in the head wound.

11:30.257 --> 11:33.458
Greg said there was a broken
wine glass at the scene.

11:33.460 --> 11:34.926
This doesn't look like
any wine glass.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.795
The lamp, maybe? The...

11:36.797 --> 11:38.163
The suspected murder weapon?

11:38.165 --> 11:40.999
Yeah, that could be.

11:42.334 --> 11:43.368
You know,
for the record, morgan,

11:43.370 --> 11:46.171
I think you're an all-star, too.

11:46.173 --> 11:47.906
(laughs)

11:47.908 --> 11:48.973
Thanks, doc.

11:56.415 --> 11:58.783
News on your fibers.

11:58.785 --> 12:00.251
Good news?
I hope they match.

12:00.253 --> 12:01.986
No, sorry.

12:01.988 --> 12:03.888
I know you wanted
a better answer.

12:05.491 --> 12:06.891
Who's that?

12:06.893 --> 12:08.293
Walter blaine,
darcy's father.

12:08.295 --> 12:10.228
He heard about witten
and he wants to talk.

12:10.230 --> 12:13.098
Calls me every October
on the anniversary.

12:13.100 --> 12:16.267
Every year, it's the
same conversation.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.369
Sara, thanks much
for your time.

12:18.371 --> 12:21.172
Of course.
Please, have a seat.

12:23.976 --> 12:27.912
So, is today the day
we've been waiting for?

12:27.914 --> 12:31.216
Well, he's been brought
in for questioning.

12:31.218 --> 12:33.017
He did it again.

12:33.019 --> 12:34.953
That's all I can say, walter.

12:34.955 --> 12:38.022
Please tell me you're gonna
get him this time.

12:38.024 --> 12:41.359
I promise that I will do
everything in my power

12:41.361 --> 12:42.827
To get justice for darcy.

12:42.829 --> 12:47.232
She would've been 30 this year.

12:47.234 --> 12:50.401
Imagine that.

12:50.403 --> 12:53.772
(whispers):
She didn't deserve...

12:53.774 --> 12:55.840
(sighs)

12:58.010 --> 13:02.347
Aah...
Closure's a myth.

13:02.349 --> 13:05.383
Doesn't exist.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.886
Look, I know
that bringing witten down

13:07.888 --> 13:10.054
Isn't gonna bring her back.

13:10.056 --> 13:14.125
But at least he'll never
be able to do it again.

13:21.834 --> 13:23.234
What are you doing?

13:23.236 --> 13:26.404
The fiber sara pulled
from over there

13:26.406 --> 13:28.006
Wasn't a match
to the bloody fiber

13:28.008 --> 13:32.544
So I'm thinking it must have
come from someplace else.

13:32.546 --> 13:35.413
Wow, you guys really
don't give up, do you?

13:35.415 --> 13:36.881
No, we don't.

13:36.883 --> 13:38.950
Especially since
we have a pretty good idea

13:38.952 --> 13:41.386
About what happened here
14 years ago.

13:42.588 --> 13:45.223
It's got to be somewhere.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.331
You know, I, uh, get

13:53.333 --> 13:55.500
That you want
to put this guy away.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.135
But don't you think
the best way to do that

13:57.137 --> 13:59.370
Would be to
focus on last night?

14:10.349 --> 14:12.450
Did you find
what you're looking for?

14:12.452 --> 14:13.484
No.

14:13.486 --> 14:16.054
But maybe something better.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.989
It's desiccant gel--
like the kind

14:17.991 --> 14:20.391
Used in pill bottles
to keep the contents dry.

14:20.393 --> 14:23.628
Uh-huh.
Removes excess moisture.

14:23.630 --> 14:27.065
And more cork.

14:27.067 --> 14:30.268
Maybe the cork downstairs
wasn't from a wine bottle.

14:32.338 --> 14:35.206
You know, jack witten's father
was a huge art collector.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.208
And he left everything
to jack, but,

14:37.210 --> 14:41.145
I mean, these are all
movie posters.

14:41.147 --> 14:42.447
Where's the good stuff?

14:42.449 --> 14:44.182
What are you getting at?
You know,

14:44.184 --> 14:47.085
Maybe what happened last night
didn't start in the bedroom.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.621
Maybe it started
in a preservation room.

14:49.623 --> 14:50.989
It's a sealed vault

14:50.991 --> 14:53.057
Where collectors keep their art.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.659
It's climate-controlled.

14:54.661 --> 14:58.663
Gel and cork are used
in the construction.

14:58.665 --> 15:02.133
Well, we've been
all over this place and, uh...

15:02.135 --> 15:04.535
Haven't found
a preservation room.

15:04.537 --> 15:06.604
Sanders:
Hey.

15:06.606 --> 15:09.374
There's a break
in the baseboard.

15:11.477 --> 15:12.577
(hollow thumping)

15:14.546 --> 15:16.314
Whoa.

15:22.454 --> 15:25.156
(muffled shouting)

15:25.158 --> 15:26.557
There's someone
in there.

15:26.559 --> 15:27.959
Need a password.

15:27.961 --> 15:31.529
We have to cut
through that door.

15:31.531 --> 15:34.632
Russell, it's finn.
Send an emergency response team

15:34.634 --> 15:37.101
To witten's house and tell them
to bring a plasma torch.

15:37.103 --> 15:38.536
We're in.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.405
How?
10-22-02,

15:40.407 --> 15:42.440
The day <i>the premiere</i>
<i>was supposed to open.</i>

15:42.442 --> 15:44.509
(muffled cries)
lvpd!

15:51.684 --> 15:52.984
It's all right.
You're gonna be okay.

15:52.986 --> 15:56.621
Please. He tried to kill us.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.457
Me and my friend.

15:59.459 --> 16:02.093
Is she here? Is gwen okay?

16:10.502 --> 16:13.104
(sighs)

16:13.106 --> 16:14.706
Emily,
I'm csi russell.

16:14.708 --> 16:16.374
And I'm csi sidle.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.343
Doc says that you're doing
a little better.

16:18.345 --> 16:20.144
Still feel a little dizzy.

16:20.146 --> 16:21.346
We could come back,
if you'd like.

16:21.348 --> 16:23.314
No. No, I want to help.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.482
Russell:
Good, good.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.417
Do you think you can
take us through

16:26.419 --> 16:27.618
What happened last night?

16:27.620 --> 16:32.557
Me and gwen, we met
this old guy at a club.

16:32.559 --> 16:35.026
He bought us champagne.

16:35.028 --> 16:38.363
I got drunk. Stupid.

16:38.365 --> 16:40.264
It's okay.

16:40.266 --> 16:42.133
We went back to his place.

16:42.135 --> 16:44.302
I needed to use the restroom.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.337
Said he'd show me.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.473
He pushed me
into that weird room.

16:48.475 --> 16:52.610
Tied me up, locked me in.

16:52.612 --> 16:57.382
Then... I could hear him.

16:57.384 --> 17:00.585
And I could hear her screaming,

17:00.587 --> 17:03.388
Telling him to stop.

17:05.758 --> 17:08.659
I never should've
left gwen alone.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.361
It's not your fault, emily.

17:10.363 --> 17:13.231
So-so you were
in the preservation room

17:13.233 --> 17:14.532
When witten attacked
your friend,

17:14.534 --> 17:16.367
Is-is that right?

17:16.369 --> 17:20.238
Yeah. That's right.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.507
Okay.

17:22.509 --> 17:24.075
Can you call the doctor?

17:24.077 --> 17:26.110
I really feel awful.

17:26.112 --> 17:28.179
Of course.

17:30.549 --> 17:33.518
What was that about exactly?
Emily just told you

17:33.520 --> 17:35.386
That witten locked her
in the preservation room.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.588
Yeah, she did.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.390
You don't believe her.
No, I didn't say that.

17:39.392 --> 17:40.792
But I do think
it's a little curious

17:40.794 --> 17:42.460
That she could hear so much.

17:42.462 --> 17:44.195
Locked in a vault,

17:44.197 --> 17:46.330
Far away from the
scene of the crime.

17:46.332 --> 17:49.400
A-all I'm saying is
if you want him this time,

17:49.402 --> 17:51.436
You're gonna need more
than her statement.

17:51.438 --> 17:52.770
Yeah, and I'm gonna get
what I need.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.505
Okay.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.708
Hey, sara, sometimes
you push too hard,

17:57.710 --> 17:59.177
And you know it.

17:59.179 --> 18:02.814
Just... Don't.

18:07.219 --> 18:08.619
Brody:
<i>So we got trace</i>

18:08.621 --> 18:10.655
On that piece of glass
that doc pulled

18:10.657 --> 18:13.391
From our victim, gwen onetta.

18:13.393 --> 18:15.526
Did the glass come
from witten's lamp?

18:15.528 --> 18:19.797
No. Density and refractive index
don't match.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.632
"silica, sodium oxide,

18:21.634 --> 18:25.103
With a broadband
anti-reflective coating."

18:25.105 --> 18:27.839
Sounds like
a flashlight lens.
That's what I was thinking.

18:27.841 --> 18:30.341
I followed up
on emily bridwell,

18:30.343 --> 18:32.543
Our girl
in the hospital.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.679
Turns out, she was questioned

18:34.681 --> 18:36.614
In a string of burglaries
in summerlin,

18:36.616 --> 18:38.549
Along with her roommates,

18:38.551 --> 18:41.519
Our girl in the morgue,
gwen onetta.

18:41.521 --> 18:43.387
Flashlights, burglaries...

18:43.389 --> 18:45.523
Maybe these girls
weren't <i>invited</i>

18:45.525 --> 18:46.524
To witten's house.

18:46.526 --> 18:48.526
Maybe they invited themselves.

18:48.528 --> 18:50.862
Pair of "bling ringers,"
vegas-style?

18:50.864 --> 18:53.197
Wait a minute, just because
these girls were questioned

18:53.199 --> 18:55.466
In break-ins doesn't mean
that witten's not guilty.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.435
Guy has a serious
security system,

18:57.437 --> 18:59.737
So how would these so-called
"bling ringers" get in

18:59.739 --> 19:02.273
In the first place,
let alone one of them end up

19:02.275 --> 19:03.274
In a locked vault?

19:03.276 --> 19:05.176
Those are all
good questions.

19:05.178 --> 19:07.445
Questions we know how to answer.

19:07.447 --> 19:09.514
Yeah, we need to get our hands
on that murder weapon.

19:09.516 --> 19:14.218
Haven't we turned that house
upside-down at this point?

19:14.220 --> 19:17.822
There is one room
we haven't searched yet.

19:37.876 --> 19:41.212
♪

20:01.366 --> 20:02.700
Hey, sara...

20:02.702 --> 20:03.968
I found the murder weapon.

20:03.970 --> 20:06.637
Yeah, and it has
emily bridwell's prints on it.

20:06.639 --> 20:10.675
But I think you might want
to have another conversation.

20:10.677 --> 20:12.677
Yeah, well, that's gonna
be a little difficult.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.645
She died in the hospital
two hours ago.

20:14.647 --> 20:17.315
I got to call you back.

20:19.551 --> 20:20.851
What the hell
happened?

20:20.853 --> 20:22.720
No smurf jokes, please.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.322
Can you explain
this to me?

20:24.324 --> 20:27.592
C.O.D. Is paralysis of
the respiratory system.

20:27.594 --> 20:30.394
My educated guess
is that it was caused

20:30.396 --> 20:35.666
Blue skin is the result of
a reaction called argyria.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.568
<i>Nanosilver's broken down</i>
<i>in the stomach,</i>

20:37.570 --> 20:40.805
<i>Absorbed into the bloodstream</i>
<i>as a salt</i>

20:40.807 --> 20:44.442
And then deposited in the skin,
<i>where exposure to light</i>

20:44.444 --> 20:46.944
<i>Turns the salt back</i>
<i>into elemental silver,</i>

20:46.946 --> 20:49.547
Creating the skin's bluish hue.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.415
How would
she have ingested silver?

20:51.417 --> 20:52.984
I was just about to find out.

21:00.926 --> 21:01.959
Whoa.

21:04.630 --> 21:08.532
What is that?

21:08.534 --> 21:10.835
It looks like film.

21:12.638 --> 21:14.972
Ecklie: Okay, it's official.
I've seen everything.

21:14.974 --> 21:17.842
This girl died from
swallowing a roll of film?

21:17.844 --> 21:19.644
We know what's on it?

21:19.646 --> 21:21.779
Hodges is working on it.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.881
Patrol found
emily bridwell's car

21:23.883 --> 21:25.850
A block away
from witten's house.

21:25.852 --> 21:27.952
And a post-it
with his address

21:27.954 --> 21:29.387
And security codes.

21:29.389 --> 21:31.856
Even the password
to the preservation room.

21:31.858 --> 21:33.724
So these girls,
they were targeting

21:33.726 --> 21:35.760
Jack witten's secret vault?

21:35.762 --> 21:36.961
Yes.
Then,
for some reason,

21:36.963 --> 21:39.497
The partnership went south.

21:39.499 --> 21:40.965
Finlay:
And I think I know why.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.767
No honor among thieves.

21:42.769 --> 21:44.869
Especially when you're banging
the same guy.

21:45.671 --> 21:46.804
I checked

21:46.806 --> 21:48.439
Gwen's cell phone records.

21:48.441 --> 21:50.775
<i>Turns out emily's boyfriend</i>
<i>texted her</i>

21:50.777 --> 21:52.643
<i>At a very inconvenient time.</i>

21:52.645 --> 21:55.079
(phone chimes)

21:55.081 --> 21:57.515
Emily (chuckling):
What the...

21:57.517 --> 21:59.984
You bitch! You're screwing ryan?

21:59.986 --> 22:01.686
Emily, chill out.

22:01.688 --> 22:04.322
He said you weren't
that into him.

22:04.324 --> 22:04.722
Screw you!

22:04.724 --> 22:06.524
(grunting)

22:08.327 --> 22:10.428
Gwen:
Get off of me!
(groans)

22:10.430 --> 22:12.763
I'm out of here.

22:14.533 --> 22:16.334
Emily: You're not
going anywhere.

22:16.336 --> 22:18.102
(grunting)

22:18.104 --> 22:19.770
(glass shatters)

22:19.772 --> 22:20.838
What is wrong with you?!

22:20.840 --> 22:22.106
(thud, gwen screams)

22:24.643 --> 22:27.745
So emily kills gwen
in a jealous rage.

22:27.747 --> 22:29.814
At this point, you'd
think, you'd run.

22:29.816 --> 22:33.050
But she has to get
what she came for.

22:36.388 --> 22:37.722
Finlay:
<i>She finds the film...</i>

22:37.724 --> 22:39.857
Witten: Yeah, I've got
a dead girl in my living room.

22:39.859 --> 22:42.093
<i>...But she hears</i>
<i>jack witten downstairs.</i>

22:42.095 --> 22:43.728
Just get somebody
out here!

22:43.730 --> 22:45.629
<i>But she knows the house,</i>

22:45.631 --> 22:48.833
<i>And she knows his reputation,</i>
<i>so she improvises.</i>

22:48.835 --> 22:51.102
<i>Locks herself in the vault,</i>

22:51.104 --> 22:54.939
<i>Hides the flashlight...</i>

22:54.941 --> 22:58.109
<i>Swallows the film...</i>

22:58.111 --> 23:01.045
<i>And ties herself up.</i>

23:01.047 --> 23:04.715
<i>And then</i>
<i>she makes up her story.</i>

23:04.717 --> 23:06.851
But I guess that
clears witten, huh?

23:06.853 --> 23:08.386
Yeah, at least
for last night.

23:08.388 --> 23:09.754
Russell: What
I want to know is,

23:09.756 --> 23:11.856
What's so important
on this piece of film

23:11.858 --> 23:15.826
That that girl would
mule it out of there?

23:15.828 --> 23:17.862
♪

23:42.921 --> 23:44.688
My god.

23:44.690 --> 23:45.923
Is that who I think it is?

23:45.925 --> 23:47.091
Was.

23:50.462 --> 23:52.730
I forgot how
young she looked.

23:54.966 --> 23:56.801
Darcy blaine.

23:56.803 --> 23:58.903
Ghost from the past.

24:06.878 --> 24:09.079
Well, she's definitely
in boulder city.

24:09.081 --> 24:11.115
And I recognize these banners
from the millennium.

24:11.117 --> 24:13.050
So it's got to be 2000.

24:13.052 --> 24:15.853
So this film
that was shot of darcy,
clearly before she died,

24:15.855 --> 24:18.956
Has been in witten's vault
this whole time?

24:18.958 --> 24:20.925
It would seem so.

24:20.927 --> 24:22.927
You see the way she's
looking in the camera?

24:22.929 --> 24:26.630
She's flirting.
And witten claims that
he never met darcy before

24:26.632 --> 24:28.466
The night they walked
out of the club together.

24:28.468 --> 24:31.902
Was a lot more
to the relationship than that.
This film

24:31.904 --> 24:33.938
Proves that everything he
said about darcy is a lie.

24:33.940 --> 24:36.540
Not only did they know
each other, they were
probably having sex.

24:36.542 --> 24:39.844
Well, witten was released today.
I say we go over to his house,

24:39.846 --> 24:42.847
Shove those in his face and
force a confession out of him.

24:42.849 --> 24:44.515
Sidle:
Uh, wait a minute.

24:44.517 --> 24:46.617
If we know he's guilty,
somebody else does, too.

24:46.619 --> 24:49.019
Whoever sent our thieves
in there to steal the film.

24:49.021 --> 24:50.921
Well, it's got to be
someone who knows witten.

24:50.923 --> 24:52.590
They knew the house,
they knew the security codes,

24:52.592 --> 24:53.891
And they knew
that he had the film.

24:53.893 --> 24:55.593
But how would
they know about it?

24:55.595 --> 24:58.629
Maybe because they're
the ones who shot it.

24:58.631 --> 25:00.764
Did you test
the film itself?

25:00.766 --> 25:02.032
I did.

25:02.034 --> 25:04.902
I found exactly
300 frames

25:04.904 --> 25:07.538
Of nitrocellulose-based
film print,

25:07.540 --> 25:10.140
Manufactured
sometime before 1952.

25:10.142 --> 25:12.977
Well, that makes sense.
When planning the premiere,

25:12.979 --> 25:14.845
Witten hired a bunch
of photographers

25:14.847 --> 25:16.680
To use vintage cameras

25:16.682 --> 25:18.148
To shoot
on vintage film.

25:18.150 --> 25:20.551
Maybe one of the cameramen
shot footage of darcy

25:20.553 --> 25:22.653
For witten's personal use, too.
Someone like that

25:22.655 --> 25:24.922
Would know more
intimate details about
their relationship.

25:24.924 --> 25:27.157
They might even know the truth
of how darcy died.

25:27.159 --> 25:30.694
But why steal the film now,
14 years later?

25:30.696 --> 25:32.897
I don't know, maybe the guy
fell on hard times.

25:32.899 --> 25:35.032
It's never too late
to blackmail.
All right.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.534
Okay, let's say
we're right.

25:36.536 --> 25:39.169
How do we find
the cameraperson
that shot this?

25:39.171 --> 25:42.573
"shot" is
the operative word here.

25:42.575 --> 25:44.975
A strip of film
is like a bullet.

25:44.977 --> 25:48.212
<i>Just like a gun creates unique</i>
<i>rifling impressions on a round,</i>

25:48.214 --> 25:50.881
<i>The pressure plate in a camera</i>

25:50.883 --> 25:53.050
<i>Imprints unique scratches</i>
<i>on film.</i>

25:53.052 --> 25:56.720
These scratch patterns,
they can help us

25:56.722 --> 25:59.056
Find the camera
that shot this film.

25:59.058 --> 26:02.893
So, find the camera...
Maybe find the cameraman.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.895
Hodges:
<i>And...</i>

26:04.897 --> 26:06.564
Action.

26:06.566 --> 26:07.665
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

26:07.667 --> 26:09.900
It's a sexy walk.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.302
And look into camera.
Give me a little smile.

26:11.304 --> 26:14.238
We're testing
the film <i>stock,</i> right?

26:14.240 --> 26:16.874
Please don't tell me
how to direct.

26:16.876 --> 26:19.009
All right.

26:19.011 --> 26:20.311
And...

26:20.313 --> 26:21.612
Action.

26:21.614 --> 26:23.914
Okay, not bad.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.983
Got that one.
Go back to the one.

26:25.985 --> 26:27.952
Little happier this time.
Action.

26:27.954 --> 26:29.954
Okay, that's better.
In with a wink.

26:29.956 --> 26:32.022
Stop, wink, and cut. Okay.

26:32.024 --> 26:33.057
This feels weird.

26:33.059 --> 26:36.126
Uh-huh. No, no,
just... Okay.

26:36.128 --> 26:37.595
Cut. Never mind.

26:39.164 --> 26:40.631
Silent film.

26:40.633 --> 26:42.166
And cut. Great.

26:42.168 --> 26:43.701
You're marilyn monroe.

26:43.703 --> 26:45.069
Just the slinkiest,
sexiest lady

26:45.071 --> 26:46.370
You've ever been.

26:46.372 --> 26:48.072
Looks great.

26:48.074 --> 26:50.274
Okay, okay, no, that's...
That's too sexy.

26:50.276 --> 26:52.843
Hodges:
I located five vintage

26:52.845 --> 26:55.279
35-millimeter cameras
in the vegas area.

26:55.281 --> 26:56.947
Two from wlvu's
film department

26:56.949 --> 26:58.749
And three from
a seedy pawnshop.

27:01.152 --> 27:02.653
Scratch pattern
is identical.

27:02.655 --> 27:03.921
Which camera was it?

27:03.923 --> 27:05.723
This little baby here.

27:05.725 --> 27:11.061
Sold to the pawnshop two months
ago by a guy named bob geer.

27:11.063 --> 27:14.298
He was a cameraman
employed by jack witten.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.400
And pd is pulling an
address right now.

27:17.836 --> 27:19.770
Man:
<i>Robert geer.</i>
<i>(knocking on door)</i>

27:24.109 --> 27:26.343
Robert geer. Lvpd.

27:27.278 --> 27:29.213
Mr. Geer?

27:30.982 --> 27:33.150
Hello?

27:55.807 --> 27:57.875
Been dead a while.

28:07.318 --> 28:11.221
C.O.D. On our cameraman was
a single gunshot to the head.

28:11.223 --> 28:14.058
.22-- same caliber as a gun

28:14.060 --> 28:15.793
Registered to jack witten.

28:15.795 --> 28:18.062
All right, but .22's
a pretty common gun.

28:18.064 --> 28:19.863
Doesn't necessarily
point to witten.

28:19.865 --> 28:21.098
This does.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.867
Geer's bank records
going back to 2000.

28:23.869 --> 28:26.970
Russell:
Wow. $750,000 transferred

28:26.972 --> 28:28.238
Into geer's account from

28:28.240 --> 28:30.174
Iris corp? What's that?
That is an llc

28:30.176 --> 28:33.444
That witten formed
to build his casino.

28:33.446 --> 28:35.345
I think it's blackmail money.

28:35.347 --> 28:38.115
Witten paid off geer
because geer knew

28:38.117 --> 28:39.983
That he had killed
darcy, is that right?

28:39.985 --> 28:42.920
Yes, and then 14 years later
he's run through the money.

28:42.922 --> 28:44.088
He needs more.

28:44.090 --> 28:45.856
But this time,
his word against witten

28:45.858 --> 28:49.026
Right, this time he
needs concrete proof

28:49.028 --> 28:50.828
Of witten's relationship
with darcy.

28:50.830 --> 28:55.165
And the post-it that we found
in emily bridwell's car

28:55.167 --> 28:57.267
With witten's address
and security codes on it?

28:57.269 --> 29:00.437
It's in bob geer's
handwriting.

29:00.439 --> 29:02.806
He hired our thieves.

29:02.808 --> 29:06.043
So it looks like geer,
after all this time,

29:06.045 --> 29:10.147
Decided to put the pinch
on witten again. Okay.

29:10.149 --> 29:11.782
So the guy worked for me.

29:11.784 --> 29:13.117
Everybody knows that.
But geer

29:13.119 --> 29:16.019
Knew about you and darcy.
He came back

29:16.021 --> 29:17.454
For more money,
so you killed him.

29:17.456 --> 29:20.090
(chuckles)
here we go again.

29:20.092 --> 29:21.191
Brass: But this time
it's gonna stick.

29:21.193 --> 29:22.793
We pulled a .22-caliber bullet

29:22.795 --> 29:25.863
Out of geer's head--
same caliber as your gun.

29:25.865 --> 29:27.397
We're running it now.
I didn't do it.

29:27.399 --> 29:28.999
Wha...

29:29.001 --> 29:31.902
I haven't seen geer in...
Forever.

29:31.904 --> 29:33.904
I barely knew the guy.

29:33.906 --> 29:36.240
Just like I barely
knew darcy.

29:36.242 --> 29:38.108
When are you guys
gonna give up?

29:38.110 --> 29:40.978
For someone you barely knew, you
sure had a serious obsession.

29:48.119 --> 29:51.088
Your buddy geer shot that
for you, didn't he?

29:51.090 --> 29:53.257
You been keeping it
all these years.

29:56.928 --> 29:59.229
I've never seen that before.

29:59.231 --> 30:00.497
Oh, come on, jack,
you're getting high

30:00.499 --> 30:02.232
With a wild party girl
and 500-a-night...

30:02.234 --> 30:05.035
No, no. No, no.
Darcy wasn't like that.

30:05.037 --> 30:06.870
She had a problem, just like me.

30:06.872 --> 30:08.238
What problem was that, jack?

30:08.240 --> 30:10.274
I met her at n.A.

30:13.411 --> 30:15.579
She was a mixed-up girl.

30:15.581 --> 30:18.215
She liked old movies.

30:18.217 --> 30:20.083
We used to...

30:20.085 --> 30:22.286
Watch them in my
screening room together.

30:22.288 --> 30:24.521
She got a kick out of the
old actresses, you know?

30:24.523 --> 30:28.025
Bergman, vivien leigh,
gene tierney in <i>laura.</i>

30:29.994 --> 30:31.962
Darcy was a bright girl.

30:31.964 --> 30:34.464
She had better things
ahead of her.

30:34.466 --> 30:37.100
Yeah, I get it.
No, it wasn't like that.

30:37.102 --> 30:39.469
She was like a
daughter to me.

30:41.105 --> 30:42.239
(sighs)

30:42.241 --> 30:44.541
But I was a broken man. I...

30:46.311 --> 30:48.245
...Couldn't control myself.

30:50.348 --> 30:51.982
With drugs...

30:51.984 --> 30:55.018
With women.
With darcy.

30:57.455 --> 30:59.590
Yeah, with darcy.

31:02.460 --> 31:05.362
And for years, I tried telling
myself it never happened.

31:05.364 --> 31:08.365
<i>We were together at the club.</i>

31:08.367 --> 31:13.270
<i>Next thing I knew,</i>
<i>darcy was lying there, dead.</i>

31:13.272 --> 31:14.905
<i>And I forgot</i>
<i>bob geer was coming over</i>

31:14.907 --> 31:16.073
<i>To the house that morning.</i>

31:16.075 --> 31:17.207
I have no idea
what happened.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.642
Geer:
Stay cool, jack.

31:18.644 --> 31:20.477
Let me handle this, okay?

31:20.479 --> 31:22.112
He said he could help me.

31:22.114 --> 31:23.513
Help you get rid
of the body?

31:23.515 --> 31:26.316
Yeah.

31:26.318 --> 31:30.187
But the one thing he
didn't tell me was...

31:30.189 --> 31:32.656
How much it was gonna cost me.

31:32.658 --> 31:34.491
All this time,
you guys

31:34.493 --> 31:36.493
Have been trying to prove
I'm a killer.

31:36.495 --> 31:39.062
I got your proof.

31:42.367 --> 31:46.036
When I was cleaning up,

31:46.038 --> 31:48.472
Geer took this picture of darcy.

31:52.610 --> 31:54.444
Sometimes I forget
what I did.

31:54.446 --> 31:58.015
So I kept this.

31:58.017 --> 32:02.419
So I never forget
the kind of person I really am.

32:04.622 --> 32:07.324
I just heard--
witten confessed.

32:07.326 --> 32:09.192
(sighs):
Yeah.

32:09.194 --> 32:11.495
Uh, thought
you'd be happier.

32:11.497 --> 32:13.997
Ballistics just came back
on the bullet that killed geer.

32:13.999 --> 32:15.666
It wasn't a match
to witten's gun.

32:15.668 --> 32:17.668
Okay, so maybe witten had
someone else do it for him.

32:17.670 --> 32:18.969
We still have him for darcy.

32:18.971 --> 32:23.040
About that, either, anymore.
Witten said that he'd never seen

32:23.042 --> 32:25.642
That old film of darcy before;
he was telling the truth.

32:25.644 --> 32:27.377
What do you mean?

32:27.379 --> 32:29.313
This film collection
in witten's vault

32:29.315 --> 32:31.381
Was a recent
acquisition.

32:32.350 --> 32:34.351
The film canisters
belonged to bob geer?

32:34.353 --> 32:35.986
Up until a month ago.

32:35.988 --> 32:37.955
At which time he pawned
his vintage camera

32:37.957 --> 32:39.456
And all his film,
including the can

32:39.458 --> 32:41.425
That had 300 frames
of darcy blaine.

32:41.427 --> 32:43.393
I spoke to the
pawnshop owner.

32:43.395 --> 32:45.162
He said that a regular--
one of his collectors--

32:45.164 --> 32:49.032
Bought all the film-- that
collector was jack witten.

32:49.034 --> 32:51.435
We've been thinking that
bob geer wanted to get ahold

32:51.437 --> 32:53.603
Of that film of darcy
so that he could prove

32:53.605 --> 32:55.439
That witten was lying
about their relationship--

32:55.441 --> 33:00.210
But why go after
that film if he had
something even better?

33:00.212 --> 33:03.046
Sanders: Yeah, not just proof
of their relationship, but...

33:03.048 --> 33:05.182
Proof of murder.

33:05.184 --> 33:06.450
This doesn't make any sense.

33:06.452 --> 33:08.385
What am I looking at?
The tox panel

33:08.387 --> 33:11.288
On darcy blaine's blood
that we found in the car trunk

33:11.290 --> 33:13.323
Definitely had high
levels of cocaine, but...

33:13.325 --> 33:15.726
We're saying that
she was roofied, right?

33:15.728 --> 33:17.227
Right.

33:17.229 --> 33:19.496
Well, it's weird
because the ghb

33:19.498 --> 33:21.498
Was never fully metabolized
into her blood.

33:21.500 --> 33:25.035
Meaning what?
It just doesn't
make sense.

33:25.037 --> 33:27.504
Greg, you are a great tech.

33:27.506 --> 33:30.207
And I know that you want
to be in the field.

33:30.209 --> 33:32.476
In this job, sometimes you got
to go beyond numbers.

33:32.478 --> 33:35.245
Beyond what's
on the face of things.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.585
What are you thinking about?

33:43.321 --> 33:46.423
Something catherine once told me
about looking deeper.

33:48.192 --> 33:50.527
The tin man's rivet.

33:50.529 --> 33:54.131
Uh, for the most recent
reissue of <i>the wizard of oz</i>

33:54.133 --> 33:56.166
They used a new
restoration technique.

33:56.168 --> 33:59.770
Details that had been lost
had suddenly now become vivid.

33:59.772 --> 34:02.372
One of those being
that the tin man had a rivet

34:02.374 --> 34:06.109
Between his eyes that nobody
had seen in 50 years.

34:06.111 --> 34:08.545
Maybe there's some detail in
this film that we're not seeing.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.547
There's only one way
to find out.

34:10.549 --> 34:12.783
I'll send this
to fotokem, have them

34:12.785 --> 34:15.485
Do a wet print and rescan it.

34:26.431 --> 34:28.432
January 2001.

34:28.434 --> 34:30.600
The bank was torn
down in '05,

34:30.602 --> 34:33.236
But I remembered
it had a news ticker.

34:34.639 --> 34:36.506
That film was shot

34:36.508 --> 34:39.643
Two months after darcy blaine
was supposedly murdered.

34:39.645 --> 34:42.179
She faked her death.

34:43.347 --> 34:45.348
Sanders:
And she's smiling at the camera

34:45.350 --> 34:47.417
Because she got
away with it.

35:04.102 --> 35:05.335
Darcy.

35:05.337 --> 35:06.536
I've been
looking for you.

35:06.538 --> 35:08.872
Sorry, my name's vivian.

35:08.874 --> 35:11.475
Oh, right, uh,
"vivian sinclair."

35:11.477 --> 35:13.844
We found that
in bob geer's cell phone.

35:13.846 --> 35:16.413
"vivian" as in "vivien leigh,"
your favorite movie star

35:16.415 --> 35:18.482
And "sinclair," as in
your mother's maiden name.

35:18.484 --> 35:20.550
Hotel blanc said
that vivian sinclair

35:20.552 --> 35:24.521
Was checking out tonight,
heading home to chicago.

35:24.523 --> 35:27.524
Sorry to delay
your flight.

35:27.526 --> 35:29.159
You're making
a big mistake.

35:29.161 --> 35:30.460
Sidle:
<i>You're the one</i>

35:30.462 --> 35:34.831
Bob geer's phone records shows
a "vivian sinclair" called him

35:34.833 --> 35:37.434
20 minutes
before he was murdered.

35:37.436 --> 35:39.169
Cell tower hit
puts you a block away

35:39.171 --> 35:40.637
From his apartment,
it puts you there.

35:40.639 --> 35:42.472
We found a gun
in your suitcase, a .22.

35:42.474 --> 35:44.574
Ballistics confirms
that it's the murder weapon.

35:44.576 --> 35:47.310
He... It was self-defense.
He attacked me.

35:47.312 --> 35:50.547
All right.

35:50.549 --> 35:52.582
14 years ago...

35:52.584 --> 35:56.486
We put ourselves on the line
for an innocent girl

35:56.488 --> 35:58.889
We thought had been murdered.

35:59.891 --> 36:01.491
You manipulated the evidence,

36:01.493 --> 36:03.593
You put
an innocent man through hell.

36:03.595 --> 36:05.662
That night, you and jack witten
were at the club,

36:05.664 --> 36:09.166
<i>But it wasn't you</i>
<i>who blacked out,</i>

36:09.168 --> 36:10.934
<i>It was witten,</i>
<i>like most nights.</i>

36:10.936 --> 36:13.670
<i>Once he was out, you called</i>
<i>your friend, bob geer.</i>

36:13.672 --> 36:16.540
Bob? He's out.

36:16.542 --> 36:18.608
Let's do this.

36:21.779 --> 36:24.581
Sidle: <i>Witten woke up</i>
<i>in a drug haze, panicked.</i>

36:24.583 --> 36:27.517
Just like you planned, bob geer
<i>showed up in the morning,</i>

36:27.519 --> 36:29.319
<i>Told witten</i>
<i>he'd take care of things.</i>

36:29.321 --> 36:31.421
(camera shutter clicking)

36:31.423 --> 36:34.691
<i>And then, you two</i>
<i>took care of things.</i>

36:34.693 --> 36:38.428
(laughing)

36:38.430 --> 36:39.896
(laughs)

36:39.898 --> 36:41.498
Sidle:
<i>You drew your own blood.</i>

36:41.500 --> 36:43.400
<i>You made it look like</i>
<i>you'd been roofied.</i>

36:43.402 --> 36:47.270
<i>And then you planted it</i>
<i>in your car trunk.</i>

36:50.241 --> 36:51.975
<i>You framed jack witten.</i>

36:51.977 --> 36:53.877
The man that was trying
to help you.

36:53.879 --> 36:56.913
You think witten was trying
to help me?

36:56.915 --> 36:59.282
You don't know
jack witten.

36:59.284 --> 37:01.251
He was like
every other man in my life--

37:01.253 --> 37:02.485
Just trying to use me.

37:02.487 --> 37:04.454
Is that the story
that you're going with?

37:04.456 --> 37:06.356
I got one. Bob geer.

37:06.358 --> 37:08.491
Seems like
he wasn't using you.

37:08.493 --> 37:10.293
Seems to me he was
trying to help you.

37:10.295 --> 37:12.462
Phone records show that he
reached out to you six weeks ago

37:12.464 --> 37:14.364
When he realized
that his film collection

37:14.366 --> 37:16.633
Had fallen
into the hands of jack witten,

37:16.635 --> 37:18.635
Including 300 frames

37:18.637 --> 37:20.804
That prove...

37:20.806 --> 37:22.472
That this was a lie.

37:22.474 --> 37:24.708
Dead girl.

37:25.810 --> 37:27.744
Dead girl walking.

37:32.483 --> 37:34.618
I did a terrible thing.

37:34.620 --> 37:36.553
I was a mixed-up junkie.

37:36.555 --> 37:38.555
I was desperate
and afraid.

37:38.557 --> 37:40.624
Yeah.

37:40.626 --> 37:42.559
Oh, yeah, yeah.

37:42.561 --> 37:46.263
Geer and I framed jack witten.

37:47.932 --> 37:50.567
But it was just a
way for me to escape.

37:50.569 --> 37:52.302
Escape from what?

37:52.304 --> 37:54.738
From my father,

37:54.740 --> 37:57.674
Who, I'm sure,
was devastated at my loss.

37:57.676 --> 38:00.577
You know why?

38:00.579 --> 38:01.745
Because with me gone,

38:01.747 --> 38:03.847
He couldn't come into my bed
every night

38:03.849 --> 38:05.448
When my mother was asleep.

38:07.285 --> 38:09.786
I did what I had to do
to protect myself.

38:09.788 --> 38:11.488
Sidle:
Tell that to bob geer.

38:11.490 --> 38:12.622
(laughs)

38:12.624 --> 38:15.058
I'm not a cold-blooded killer.

38:15.060 --> 38:17.060
I'm a mom!

38:17.062 --> 38:18.461
I have two girls.

38:18.463 --> 38:20.063
I have a husband and
a life that I cherish.

38:20.065 --> 38:22.632
I am not...
I'm not this person anymore.

38:22.634 --> 38:25.769
People can change.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.775
Terrible...

38:31.777 --> 38:34.644
Unspeakable things happen
to all of us,

38:34.646 --> 38:36.913
But...

38:36.915 --> 38:39.949
That doesn't give anyone the
right to destroy someone's life.

38:39.951 --> 38:42.419
Whatever happened to you,

38:42.421 --> 38:45.355
Whatever the truth is,
for 14 years,

38:45.357 --> 38:46.990
You let an innocent man believe

38:46.992 --> 38:49.659
That he killed the one thing
that he cared about.

38:49.661 --> 38:51.695
The one person
in his screwed-up universe

38:51.697 --> 38:54.531
That he genuinely loved
like a daughter.

38:54.533 --> 38:57.334
You took his desire
to protect and save you,

38:57.336 --> 38:59.002
And you perverted it.

38:59.004 --> 39:01.004
You twisted it.

39:01.006 --> 39:02.772
I know you.

39:02.774 --> 39:05.875
I know who you are.

39:05.877 --> 39:08.712
You haven't changed, darcy.

39:08.714 --> 39:10.780
You never will.

39:17.855 --> 39:18.922
Thank you.

39:18.924 --> 39:20.457
(sighs)

39:20.459 --> 39:22.826
Walter blaine has
hired counsel for darcy.

39:22.828 --> 39:26.496
He's wrapped his fatherly
arms around his daughter.

39:28.132 --> 39:30.433
Do you believe her?

39:30.435 --> 39:32.068
Her story about
him molesting her?

39:32.070 --> 39:34.871
She's definitely screwed up.

39:34.873 --> 39:37.707
Maybe it's from abuse.

39:37.709 --> 39:41.077
Maybe... She's just a bad seed.

39:41.079 --> 39:43.546
I don't know what
to believe anymore.

39:43.548 --> 39:45.048
Oh, I know that feeling.

39:49.387 --> 39:52.455
That thing I said to you
about pushing too hard...

39:53.858 --> 39:56.760
Thank god you did.

40:01.766 --> 40:03.133
(sighs)

40:03.135 --> 40:05.535
You're a free man, jack.

40:09.907 --> 40:12.142
What's going to
happen to her?

40:14.478 --> 40:17.113
Ecklie:
Wouldn't think you'd care.

40:17.115 --> 40:19.883
All these years,
and I thought I'd killed her.

40:19.885 --> 40:22.819
Had to live with that.

40:22.821 --> 40:24.421
Now, I just keep thinking

40:24.423 --> 40:26.456
I could've done more
to save her.

40:26.458 --> 40:27.757
Hey, it wasn't your fault.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.759
She made her own choices.

40:29.761 --> 40:31.861
Yeah.

40:33.631 --> 40:35.632
Look, jack, uh...

40:35.634 --> 40:37.634
I'm sorry.

40:37.636 --> 40:40.003
No apologies.

40:40.005 --> 40:42.505
You guys did your job.

40:44.508 --> 40:47.143
Thanks for giving me
my life back.

40:59.523 --> 41:01.591
(sighs)

41:06.630 --> 41:09.098
Well, it's lights out

41:09.100 --> 41:10.533
For the premiere.

41:10.535 --> 41:11.835
Witten can
still build it.

41:11.837 --> 41:13.603
Ah, it wouldn't work.

41:13.605 --> 41:15.972
Too innocent for
vegas these days.

41:21.245 --> 41:23.246
Speaking of another time...

41:23.248 --> 41:24.247
(laughs)

41:24.249 --> 41:26.182
Please put that away.

41:26.184 --> 41:28.785

41:28.787 --> 41:30.153

All this evidence,

you've had enough?
