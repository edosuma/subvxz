01:26.627 --> 01:28.921
- Night, Brian.
- See you tomorrow.

01:39.849 --> 01:41.601
Hey, what's the matter?

01:41.767 --> 01:43.185
Are you lost, honey?

01:43.894 --> 01:47.106
My big brother went away
and left me by my Ionesomes.

01:47.607 --> 01:50.985
Big brothers aren't supposed to do that
to their baby sisters.

01:52.028 --> 01:54.739
Here. Dry your eyes,
and I'll help you find a policeman.

01:54.905 --> 01:58.618
- He'll get you home safe and sound.
- You're so nice to me.

01:58.993 --> 02:02.455
But then, you always was
the nicest one, Tippy.

02:03.039 --> 02:04.832
You! But how-

02:08.919 --> 02:11.172
Sorry I had to play roughs, Tippy.

02:11.505 --> 02:13.215
I didn't mean to.

02:17.178 --> 02:18.804
Gotham Insider <i>asks,</i>

02:18.888 --> 02:20.264
<i>"Where are they now?"</i>

02:20.348 --> 02:23.684
<i>When her sitcom, Love That Baby,
premiered 20 years ago,</i>

02:23.851 --> 02:26.812
<i>little Mary Louise Dahl
became an overnight sensation.</i>

02:28.689 --> 02:33.319
<i>As the adorable Baby-Doll, young Mary
quickly captured the hearts of millions.</i>

02:34.403 --> 02:35.696
Whoa...

02:39.075 --> 02:42.703
<i>Well, Baby, you'd better have
a pretty good explanation for this.</i>

02:43.788 --> 02:45.581
<i>I didn't mean to.</i>

02:50.586 --> 02:52.630
I remember this show
from when I was a kid.

02:53.172 --> 02:54.507
It still stinks.

02:54.674 --> 02:58.803
Be that as it may, three of the cast's
original actors disappeared last week.

03:06.143 --> 03:07.269
And these two?

03:07.436 --> 03:09.397
Ms. Vance is in a show
at Gotham Rep.

03:09.772 --> 03:12.024
I have police bodyguards
following her everywhere.

03:13.567 --> 03:16.612
But that other one, Mary Dahl,
dropped out of sight years ago.

03:16.779 --> 03:20.032
Ironically, the same thing that brought
her fame turned her into a recluse.

03:20.199 --> 03:22.410
I read about her once
in a medical journal.

03:22.576 --> 03:24.912
She was born with systemic hypoplasia,

03:24.995 --> 03:27.373
a rare condition that
kept her from aging.

03:28.791 --> 03:31.168
Would you believe
she was 20 years old in that clip?

03:33.504 --> 03:35.464
She'd be about 30 now.

03:37.425 --> 03:40.177
It's obvious someone has a vendetta
against these actors.

03:40.344 --> 03:41.929
We'll study this
and call you back if we-

03:42.096 --> 03:43.389
<i>All units, all units!</i>

03:43.723 --> 03:46.142
<i>- Gunfire reported at Gotham Rep.</i>

03:46.225 --> 03:47.893
<i>They're making a try for Vance.</i>

03:49.895 --> 03:51.647
Stay down!

03:54.066 --> 03:55.651
Let me go.

03:56.026 --> 03:58.612
- Why are you doing this?
- Quiet!

03:58.779 --> 04:00.865
The lady asked you
a question, creep.

04:03.033 --> 04:04.410
How about an answer?

04:16.255 --> 04:17.506
Hey!

04:20.342 --> 04:21.802
- Ah!
- Robin!

04:35.524 --> 04:37.318
No. Help!

04:42.072 --> 04:44.033
- They're getting away.
- We'II get them.

04:55.961 --> 04:58.047
No!

05:02.134 --> 05:03.344
Mommy!

05:13.229 --> 05:15.815
I lost my mommy!

05:16.482 --> 05:17.691
It's okay.

05:17.858 --> 05:19.360
Oh, my baby.

05:20.152 --> 05:21.403
Mommy!

05:21.570 --> 05:22.988
Naughty, naughty baby.

05:23.155 --> 05:25.074
Haven't I told you not to run off?

05:25.491 --> 05:27.618
I didn't mean to.

05:28.869 --> 05:29.912
Hold it.

05:31.038 --> 05:32.873
Naughty Mr. Batmans.

05:33.082 --> 05:34.375
You play too rough.

05:41.590 --> 05:42.758
I got 'em!

05:43.843 --> 05:45.177
It's me, dope.

05:58.107 --> 06:00.401
Where am I?

06:00.943 --> 06:02.236
Huh?

06:03.696 --> 06:05.322
It can't be.

06:09.201 --> 06:12.371
Tod, June, Brian?

06:12.454 --> 06:14.248
Tammy. She got you, too.

06:14.415 --> 06:16.083
Is this some sort of bad joke?

06:16.250 --> 06:19.044
What are we doing on the old set?
And in these clothes?

06:19.211 --> 06:22.006
Welcome home, sister Suzy.

06:23.048 --> 06:25.009
I've missed you so.

06:25.509 --> 06:28.762
Mr. Happy-Head says he missed you, too.

06:29.013 --> 06:30.848
<i>Mary? Mary Dam?</i>

06:31.015 --> 06:32.349
Is this a joke?

06:32.558 --> 06:35.311
No, sillies. I'm Baby, remember?

06:35.477 --> 06:39.273
It's Suzy and Tippy,
and Mumsy, and Daddy, and Baby,

06:39.440 --> 06:44.403
together again forevers and evers.

06:51.285 --> 06:53.037
I don't care what Mayor Hill says.

06:53.120 --> 06:55.915
The people have a right to know,
and if he won't talk to us-

07:00.252 --> 07:01.670
I'll call you back, Marv.

07:01.754 --> 07:04.590
Since when are you
interested in has-been actors?

07:04.840 --> 07:07.760
Since that one's been kidnapping
her costars.

07:07.927 --> 07:08.969
You're serious?

07:09.053 --> 07:11.221
She's been picking them off, one by one.

07:11.722 --> 07:15.184
- Any reason she'd have a grudge?
- Actually, they should hate her.

07:15.643 --> 07:19.772
Dahl put them out of work when she quit
the series to become a dramatic actress.

07:22.775 --> 07:25.986
<i>What, will these hands never be clean?</i>

07:26.153 --> 07:28.864
<i>Here's the smell of the blood still.</i>

07:29.239 --> 07:33.369
<i>All the perfumes of Arabia
will not sweeten this little hand.</i>

07:37.623 --> 07:39.124
That's what the critics said.

07:39.333 --> 07:43.003
Baby's dramatic career flopped, and when
she tried to start her TV show again

07:43.087 --> 07:44.421
the networks turned her down.

07:44.505 --> 07:47.424
That still doesn't explain
why she's after her old cast.

07:47.675 --> 07:50.260
Maybe there's a clue
in these old episodes.

07:50.469 --> 07:51.887
You can borrow them if you want.

07:52.179 --> 07:55.265
And when you crack the case,
you can pay me back with an exclusive...

07:56.684 --> 07:57.977
Interview.

08:08.612 --> 08:10.155
Isn't this the best-est?

08:10.906 --> 08:14.451
Having breakfast, just like old times.

08:14.827 --> 08:18.330
- Oh. Oh, it's swell, Baby.
- Great.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.251
Uh-oh!

08:22.626 --> 08:25.379
Here comes Buster, begging for scraps.

08:37.266 --> 08:38.684
Bad boy, Buster.

08:38.851 --> 08:39.935
Go away.

08:45.983 --> 08:48.610
Hey, guess what's today. Anybody know?

08:50.320 --> 08:52.656
Oh, Come on. Guess.

08:59.329 --> 09:01.582
It's my births-day!

09:01.665 --> 09:03.751
Yay, yay for me!

09:04.084 --> 09:06.253
You mean you had us brought here

09:06.336 --> 09:09.381
just so you could throw yourself
a surprise party?

09:09.715 --> 09:12.843
That's it. I always knew
you were a selfish little brat.

09:13.385 --> 09:15.220
Always throwing your temper tantrums

09:15.512 --> 09:17.806
and making life miserable
for the rest of us.

09:17.890 --> 09:20.225
Well, this time you've gone too far.

09:20.309 --> 09:22.644
Expect a call from my lawyer.

09:30.235 --> 09:31.779
Hi-ya!

09:32.696 --> 09:36.033
- Tod!
- Isn't Mariams a treasure?

09:36.116 --> 09:38.827
I couldn't gets through the day
without hers.

09:39.078 --> 09:41.413
Naughty, naughty, Daddys.

09:44.374 --> 09:46.710
Mustn't yell at your Baby like thats.

09:47.002 --> 09:49.922
You're not my daughter.
And we're not a family.

09:50.422 --> 09:51.965
We're actors, remember?

09:52.257 --> 09:56.136
You canceled our show because you whined
you weren't getting enough attention.

09:56.220 --> 09:58.555
But I knows now I made a boo-boo.

10:03.894 --> 10:05.687
It was hard for me
out there.

10:05.771 --> 10:08.774
I studied and trained and auditioned,
but no one wanted me.

10:10.651 --> 10:11.944
AWW...

10:17.574 --> 10:21.120
Over the years, I remembered how happy
I was with all of you around me,

10:21.286 --> 10:24.498
and the folks at home
watching me each week. Me.

10:25.374 --> 10:26.625
Baby-Doll.

10:29.294 --> 10:32.881
Now I'm Baby for good,
and everyone will love me agains.

10:32.965 --> 10:34.341
Hugs,hugs!

10:37.970 --> 10:39.596
Aww.

10:44.726 --> 10:48.564
Remember that time Poison Ivy
nearly smothered us in those vines

10:49.022 --> 10:50.774
with the really sharp thorns?

10:51.150 --> 10:53.986
- Yes.
- This is worse.

10:54.403 --> 10:55.946
I did learn one thing, though.

10:56.113 --> 10:58.532
Baby hasn't gotten every member
of her cast.

10:59.158 --> 11:01.952
In the last season,
the show's ratings began to drop,

11:02.119 --> 11:04.204
so the producers introduced
a new character.

11:04.705 --> 11:06.540
Baby's little cousin Spunky.

11:11.795 --> 11:12.796
Oh.

11:13.172 --> 11:17.509
According to these, Dahl was furious
she was upstaged on her birthday episode

11:17.593 --> 11:19.136
and walked off the series.

11:20.637 --> 11:23.182
So why hasn't she gone
after cousin Spunky?

11:26.810 --> 11:29.021
Maybe she's waiting
for the right occasion.

11:49.124 --> 11:52.085
Excuse me. Excuse me!

11:52.544 --> 11:55.255
My baby was taking a nap,
and your music woke her up.

11:55.505 --> 11:57.341
Hey, I have to practice, you know?

11:58.717 --> 12:02.262
You're still a stinky jerk-face, Spunky.

12:11.813 --> 12:13.398
Wake up, sleepyheads.

12:15.943 --> 12:16.944
Huh?

12:17.277 --> 12:19.488
It's time for my birthday party.

12:19.696 --> 12:21.073
Yay!

12:21.782 --> 12:24.076
We're gonna have so much funs.

12:27.579 --> 12:30.916
- Ready when you are, Ms. Dahl.
- Goodies!

12:32.042 --> 12:35.504
You all remembers what happened
the last time I had a births-day.

12:35.921 --> 12:39.967
Poopy old Spunkys pushed my head
in the cake.

12:40.050 --> 12:43.095
Everybody laughed and laughed.

12:43.428 --> 12:46.556
Well, I'm laughing now.

12:48.600 --> 12:51.853
What are you mad at me for?
It wasn't anything personal.

12:52.938 --> 12:55.524
We were just playing characters
in a TV show.

12:55.691 --> 12:56.942
It was real to me.

12:57.109 --> 12:59.861
Everybody loved Baby-Doll
until you came along.

13:00.028 --> 13:01.947
You made them forget me.

13:05.284 --> 13:08.495
Now Baby's gonna get evens.

13:17.087 --> 13:21.091
- No, don't. Stop her.
- Help! Wait!

13:22.926 --> 13:26.972
It's never too late
to have a happy childhood.

13:39.192 --> 13:42.821
Blow out the candle, Spunky.
Bet your wish doesn't come trues.

13:55.375 --> 13:58.295
Cheater! Cheater! Cheater! Cheater!

14:04.718 --> 14:07.721
Mr. Happy-Head says
you're really gonna get it nows.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.664
Thanks, partner.

14:34.748 --> 14:36.208
Anytime.

14:39.711 --> 14:41.880
No fairs. No fairs.

14:42.089 --> 14:44.466
He wasn't Spunky at alls.

14:44.549 --> 14:47.302
I told Spunky what you were up to.
We switched places.

14:47.469 --> 14:50.555
Batman rigged me with a transmitter
that led him here.

14:50.639 --> 14:54.351
Ah, aren't you Mr. Smarty-Heads.

15:19.835 --> 15:22.087
Wow, lady, you're good.

15:22.462 --> 15:23.547
It's a living.

15:23.922 --> 15:25.257
H I-ya!

15:29.928 --> 15:31.054
H I-ya!

15:43.233 --> 15:45.944
Get the hostages out.
I'll go after Dahl.

15:46.027 --> 15:50.157
Right. Hang on, folks. I'll have you
back to reality in a second.

15:57.956 --> 15:59.082
Yay!

16:31.865 --> 16:33.200
Watch it, kid.

16:46.630 --> 16:47.631
Hmm.

16:56.014 --> 16:59.809
- It's Batman.
- Cool. Hey, Batman, down here.

16:59.893 --> 17:01.353
Hey, do you see what I see?

17:01.811 --> 17:04.231
- Look at those people. It's Batman!
- It's Batman.

17:04.397 --> 17:06.316
- Look.
- Wow, it's Batman.

18:22.183 --> 18:25.979
Silly Mr. Batmans, can't catch me.

18:27.647 --> 18:31.651
Don't run away.
I know you're scared, confused.

18:31.901 --> 18:35.655
- I can help you.
- Liar, liar, cape on fire.

18:48.627 --> 18:51.838
Nows we're playing by my rules.

18:57.010 --> 18:59.804
Game's overs, Mr. Batman.

19:01.514 --> 19:02.974
I wins.

19:07.228 --> 19:09.064
No fair!

19:28.792 --> 19:29.834
Look.

19:31.044 --> 19:32.462
That's me in there.

19:32.796 --> 19:34.422
The real me.

19:35.382 --> 19:36.675
There I am.

19:38.802 --> 19:40.720
But it's not really real, is it?

19:41.388 --> 19:46.267
Just made up and pretend like my family
and my life and everything else.

19:50.647 --> 19:53.733
Why couldn't you just let me
make-believe?

20:34.441 --> 20:36.484
I didn't mean to.

21:08.850 --> 21:09.851
English - SDH
