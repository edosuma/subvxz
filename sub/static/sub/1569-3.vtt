WEBVTT

00:08.000 --> 00:09.206
<i>I'm Peggy Carter.</i>

00:09.320 --> 00:12.529
<i>During the war, I fought side-by-side
with Captain America.</i>

00:12.600 --> 00:13.726
<i>We defeated the enemy...</i>

00:13.800 --> 00:15.689
Please, don't do this.
We have time.

00:15.760 --> 00:17.649
<i>But I lost the love of my life.</i>

00:17.720 --> 00:19.165
<i>- I work for the SSR,</i>

00:19.240 --> 00:20.685
<i>America's premier
covert intelligence agency.</i>

00:21.880 --> 00:23.120
<i>But now that the war is over,</i>

00:23.200 --> 00:24.804
<i>my mission parameters
these days are...</i>

00:24.920 --> 00:26.285
Agent Carter, cover the phones.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.361
<i>...different.</i>

00:27.440 --> 00:29.044
<i>That all changed when an old friend</i>

00:29.120 --> 00:30.804
<i>asked me to become a double agent.</i>

00:30.960 --> 00:32.849
I have a vault.
Somebody cleaned me out.

00:33.040 --> 00:34.371
A couple of weeks later,
my inventions...

00:34.440 --> 00:36.204
They start turning up
on the black market.

00:36.280 --> 00:38.965
As of this moment, Howard Stark
is a fugitive from justice.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.765
You're the only one
that can clear my name.

00:40.840 --> 00:42.080
<i>He left me with an ally.</i>

00:42.160 --> 00:44.128
Edwin Jarvis.
He'll help you in any way he can.

00:44.360 --> 00:46.727
<i>I found the man
who stole Howard's inventions.</i>

00:47.200 --> 00:48.964
<i>He was part of a bigger conspiracy.</i>

00:49.280 --> 00:50.805
<i>Leviathan is coming.</i>

00:55.880 --> 00:56.881
Who is Leviathan?

00:56.960 --> 00:58.041
<i>He didn't have time to tell me.</i>

00:58.160 --> 00:59.810
<i>All he left behind was a symbol.</i>

01:00.320 --> 01:02.049
<i>I must determine what this means</i>

01:02.120 --> 01:04.521
<i>before the SSR catches up to me...</i>

01:06.680 --> 01:08.011
<i>Or my friends.</i>

02:36.280 --> 02:38.089
Clearly, you don't know
the rules of the house.

02:39.240 --> 02:41.288
Is this not apartment 3F?

02:41.400 --> 02:42.401
- Who are you?

02:42.480 --> 02:44.881
Jimmy. My girlfriend,
Molly, she lives here.

02:44.960 --> 02:46.200
I swear.

02:46.560 --> 02:49.404
5'5", blonde, works at Bonwit Teller?

02:50.120 --> 02:51.565
Next one over.

02:51.760 --> 02:53.250
Oh...

02:53.400 --> 02:55.607
Would it be too much trouble
if I could come...

02:58.080 --> 03:00.287
Have a nice night.

03:01.400 --> 03:03.880
His room key is the only
evidence we found at the crime scene.

03:03.960 --> 03:05.246
What can you tell us about him?

03:05.320 --> 03:07.288
He was relatively clean.

03:08.520 --> 03:11.444
He came and went
without so much as a peep.

03:11.520 --> 03:12.965
Any visitors?

03:13.040 --> 03:14.929
Only for just an hour.

03:24.680 --> 03:26.205
Looks like business is good.

03:26.280 --> 03:28.408
Hey, Ray. How you doing?

03:31.880 --> 03:33.564
This is it, 424.

03:38.320 --> 03:40.641
Check all the usual hidey-holes.

03:42.920 --> 03:44.729
Hey! Take it easy on the furniture.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.126
That'll be all. Thank you.

03:52.920 --> 03:55.400
All right, welcome to amateur hour.

03:55.720 --> 03:57.927
I got cash, passports.

03:58.720 --> 04:01.371
Got a British passport
for "Alfred Lean."

04:01.440 --> 04:04.649
An American passport
for an "Orson Hawks,"

04:04.720 --> 04:10.011
and an Italian pass-a-port
for "Federico Rossellini."

04:10.080 --> 04:11.320
We got a film buff on our hands.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.045
What you got?
You find something?

04:16.079 --> 04:18.242
Well, it sure isn't nothing.

04:28.080 --> 04:31.289
Powdered eggs again.
What am I paying for?

04:31.360 --> 04:32.691
Still, better than the blitz,
right, English?

04:32.760 --> 04:35.127
- Oh, just barely.
- Morning, girls.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.167
Someone had a late night.

04:36.240 --> 04:38.129
What time did the cat drag you in?

04:38.200 --> 04:40.009
I didn't exactly get dragged out.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.562
- Molly, you didn't.
- What can I say?

04:42.640 --> 04:44.449
Jimmy is very persuasive.

04:44.520 --> 04:45.681
And nimble.

04:45.760 --> 04:47.091
You got a guy, Peggy?

04:47.160 --> 04:48.764
I'm afraid I'm married
to my work at the moment.

04:48.960 --> 04:51.008
- What about Mr. Fancy?
- Who's that?

04:51.080 --> 04:52.809
You know, the guy I've seen
around the Automat,

04:52.880 --> 04:54.370
nice suit, nice car, nice shoulders.

04:54.480 --> 04:55.811
Oh, no. No.

04:55.880 --> 04:58.281
He's just a colleague.

04:58.400 --> 05:01.006
Good day, ladies.
Early bird and all that.

05:01.160 --> 05:04.562
Ah, Miss Carter, please sit.
This will only be a moment.

05:07.400 --> 05:10.643
In 1925, the great Harry Houdini

05:10.720 --> 05:12.563
performed at this very building.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.206
Ugh, Houdini. That's never good.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.408
Women stood spellbound and watched

05:17.480 --> 05:20.848
as he escaped from handcuffs,

05:20.920 --> 05:22.729
straitjackets, steamer trunks.

05:23.080 --> 05:26.163
But the one trick he could not pull off

05:26.400 --> 05:30.769
was ascending the stairs.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.368
It's a simple rule, ladies.

05:33.440 --> 05:37.286
No men above the first floor.

05:39.400 --> 05:40.447
Molly Bowen.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.648
Please go to your room
and pack your things.

05:50.880 --> 05:53.121
Miss Fry, please.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.762
I hope you had a splendid evening,

05:55.840 --> 05:58.764
because it will be
your last at the Griffith.

06:04.280 --> 06:07.966
Let her be an example
for the rest of you.

06:09.040 --> 06:14.251
This institution is not unlike
Fort Knox or Alcatraz.

06:15.240 --> 06:20.644
Whether by force or trickery,
this building is impenetrable.

06:28.120 --> 06:30.168
Can you believe that?

06:30.520 --> 06:32.921
I don't, actually.

06:34.120 --> 06:36.566
No building is impenetrable.

06:42.480 --> 06:45.643
Ladies and gentlemen,
our pal Leet Brannis.

06:45.800 --> 06:48.804
Coroner says the amalgam
in his teeth is Russian.

06:48.880 --> 06:50.928
Yeah? How did he get the scar?

06:51.000 --> 06:52.968
- His voice box was cut out.
- Mmm.

06:53.040 --> 06:55.088
Probably happened
during the war. This guy served.

06:55.160 --> 06:57.447
Russian Rifle Division. The 478th.

06:57.560 --> 06:59.801
Now, you ready to have
your socks knocked off?

07:01.080 --> 07:03.242
- Leet Brannis died.
- I know that, son.

07:03.360 --> 07:04.805
- I'm staring at his corpse.
- Two years ago.

07:05.680 --> 07:08.684
Guy I knew in basic ended up
in the US Embassy in Moscow.

07:08.760 --> 07:10.649
I had him dig into the 478th.

07:10.720 --> 07:12.085
Turns out, they were wiped out in '44

07:12.200 --> 07:13.565
in the Battle of Finow, Germany.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.685
Dead don't walk.
At least, not in my experience.

07:16.760 --> 07:17.761
Where we at with your guy?

07:17.840 --> 07:21.481
We're still pulling what's left
of him from the truck wreckage,

07:21.560 --> 07:24.450
but we were able to lift some prints
from the passports that I found.

07:24.520 --> 07:25.885
We had a vodka bottle.
Plus, we got this beauty.

07:25.960 --> 07:27.086
- Don't touch.

07:28.600 --> 07:30.489
What did the lab rats say?

07:30.560 --> 07:32.289
They think it's some kind
of long-range transmitter.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.522
How long? Moscow-long?

07:36.160 --> 07:37.491
Run his picture by your embassy friend.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.883
- I'm on it.
- Hey, passport guy's mine.

07:40.120 --> 07:41.326
You got any friends in Moscow?

07:41.560 --> 07:42.721
Or anywhere else?

07:42.920 --> 07:43.921
- Don't be that guy.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.808
Ran the license plate we pulled
from the Roxxon debris.

07:46.880 --> 07:48.644
Belongs to Howard Stark.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.804
- I found that.
- Where's the rest of the car?

07:51.280 --> 07:52.805
Uh, we just got a plate and a bumper.

07:52.880 --> 07:55.451
Boss, Stark was on the lam
when Roxxon went down.

07:55.520 --> 07:57.761
Do we really think he would
risk his freedom to blow it up?

07:57.840 --> 07:59.569
Or in whatever the hell happened.

07:59.640 --> 08:02.849
Somebody was driving that car.
I want to know who.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.564
Edwin, leave the dishes.

08:15.680 --> 08:17.444
I can take care of it.

08:20.160 --> 08:22.242
Anna, darling, I'm going
to take you up on that offer.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.001
The day beckons.
I'll, uh, be in the garden.

08:25.080 --> 08:26.206
- Love you!
- And you!

08:32.240 --> 08:33.844
In polite society,

08:33.919 --> 08:35.729
one telephones ahead
before trespassing.

08:36.159 --> 08:38.003
I imagine strange women
traipsing through the property

08:38.120 --> 08:40.726
isn't a completely
unusual occurrence.

08:41.240 --> 08:43.686
That's a fair point.
What brings you here?

08:43.760 --> 08:45.683
My landlady gave me an idea.

08:45.760 --> 08:46.761
Oh, splendid.

08:46.880 --> 08:48.848
Why, now if we could get
an opinion from your butcher...

08:49.440 --> 08:51.807
Someone robbed
Howard's impenetrable vault.

08:51.880 --> 08:53.370
If I can find out how he got in,

08:53.440 --> 08:54.771
perhaps I can trace where he went

08:54.840 --> 08:57.491
and locate Howard's
missing technology.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.963
You're not really dressed for it,
I'm afraid.

09:03.200 --> 09:06.807
Our thief didn't exactly walk
the items out of the front door.

09:07.120 --> 09:10.329
The night of the break-in,
did you hear anything?

09:10.880 --> 09:13.804
Well, no, there was
a tremendous thunderstorm.

09:13.880 --> 09:15.689
It knocked the power out,
including the alarms,

09:15.760 --> 09:17.205
for almost two hours.

09:17.280 --> 09:19.726
Not that I would have heard any of it.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.006
I'm afraid the sultry combination

09:21.120 --> 09:24.203
of candlelight and rain
always puts me out like a baby.

09:24.280 --> 09:26.567
- Hmm.
- You're quite the guard dog.

09:27.040 --> 09:28.610
Security is not within my purview.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.729
SSR. Open up.

09:37.320 --> 09:38.367
Unbelievable.

09:38.440 --> 09:40.522
A known fugitive
isn't answering his door.

09:40.760 --> 09:41.841
Knock harder.

09:42.440 --> 09:44.044
Sure. Can I borrow your forehead?

09:54.400 --> 09:56.448
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
How may I help you?

09:56.640 --> 09:59.849
Afternoon. Agents Thompson
and Sousa with the SSR.

09:59.920 --> 10:00.921
If you're looking for Mr. Stark,

10:01.000 --> 10:02.764
I'm afraid he's indefinitely unavailable.

10:02.840 --> 10:04.569
We're well aware of that, Mr. Jarvis.

10:04.640 --> 10:06.608
That is your name, isn't it?
Mr. Edwin Jarvis?

10:06.680 --> 10:08.364
You misplace anything recently?

10:08.440 --> 10:10.966
Yes, I did lose a fountain pen
on Fifth Avenue.

10:12.040 --> 10:13.371
How about the bumper
off a Fleetmaster?

10:13.440 --> 10:14.441
Anything like that?

10:14.880 --> 10:17.087
Just the bumper?
Wish you'd found the entire car.

10:17.160 --> 10:19.527
I reported it stolen several days ago.

10:19.600 --> 10:22.524
Detective Davis at the 19th Precinct
was very helpful.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.650
If there's nothing further...

10:27.720 --> 10:30.485
That bumper was found
at a major crime scene.

10:30.560 --> 10:31.561
There's plenty further.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.571
Mr. Stark doesn't like visitors,

10:38.640 --> 10:40.529
whether he's here
to receive them or not.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.804
Look, Mr. Jarvis, I can call a judge

10:42.880 --> 10:44.405
and wait here to get a warrant.

10:45.920 --> 10:48.241
But honestly, it's almost lunchtime
and I'm hungry.

10:48.320 --> 10:49.526
How would you like
to take a ride downtown?

10:51.480 --> 10:53.209
Well, lead the way.

10:59.400 --> 11:00.811
Well, this will be novel.

11:00.920 --> 11:03.844
I haven't been in the back
of a car in years.

11:13.920 --> 11:16.366
Come on, Butch. Be a pal?

11:17.120 --> 11:20.010
Sorry, Krzeminski. I got plans.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.764
Yauch, what about you?

11:21.840 --> 11:24.286
Told my gal I'd take her to a show.
Cover my shift tonight.

11:24.360 --> 11:26.761
I can't swing it.
Why don't you ask Carter?

11:27.360 --> 11:28.361
Right.

11:28.440 --> 11:30.568
Dooley would kill me
if I let a lady take nights.

11:30.640 --> 11:33.723
Besides, she can barely
make her own shift.

11:33.800 --> 11:35.643
Work day starts at 9:00 a.m., honey.

11:35.720 --> 11:37.131
Tell me, Agent Krzeminski,

11:37.200 --> 11:38.486
who are you bringing to the show,

11:38.560 --> 11:41.131
- your wife or your girlfriend?

11:43.360 --> 11:45.283
Come on in. Have a seat.

11:48.760 --> 11:50.364
We really appreciate you
coming down here

11:50.480 --> 11:52.289
to talk with us, Mr. Jarvis.

11:52.640 --> 11:53.766
<i>Well, naturally.</i>

11:53.840 --> 11:55.649
<i>But I don't think I can tell you
anything that isn't already</i>

11:55.720 --> 11:57.165
<i>in the missing-car report I filed.</i>

11:57.240 --> 11:59.208
<i>That report might
take us a while to dig up.</i>

11:59.320 --> 12:00.810
<i>You see, the NYPD aren't as efficient</i>

12:00.880 --> 12:02.882
<i>as the SSR at record-keeping,</i>

12:02.960 --> 12:07.124
<i>which is saying something,
because our files are a wreck.</i>

12:07.840 --> 12:10.571
That hurts. My filing's impeccable.

12:10.640 --> 12:12.005
Isn't that Stark's butler?

12:12.640 --> 12:15.325
- You know this guy?
- Only from the file.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.689
Do you think he was really involved
in the Roxxon implosion?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.889
Well, maybe he didn't blow the place up,

12:19.960 --> 12:21.769
but he's capable of driving
a getaway car.

12:21.840 --> 12:24.320
It's funny.

12:25.360 --> 12:28.011
A lot of stuff gets stolen
from Howard Stark,

12:28.080 --> 12:29.320
cars, bombs, death rays.

12:30.040 --> 12:32.566
Actually, the death ray's accounted for.

12:32.640 --> 12:34.688
It's in Nevada, I believe.

12:34.840 --> 12:35.921
Hmm.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.291
You know these men?

12:41.560 --> 12:42.925
Take a good look.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.923
We have reliable
information that says

12:45.000 --> 12:46.968
that both of these men
were in possession

12:47.360 --> 12:49.966
<i>of some of your boss's
missin' doohickeys,</i>

12:51.480 --> 12:52.720
<i>and now they're dead.</i>

12:53.080 --> 12:55.082
Oh, what a pity.

12:55.160 --> 12:57.527
Sounds like you found our thieves.

12:59.680 --> 13:02.251
Unless, of course,
they were working for your boss.

13:04.960 --> 13:06.246
Would you look at that?
Five minutes in,

13:06.320 --> 13:08.129
and Thompson hasn't
knocked out a single tooth.

13:08.200 --> 13:09.361
Well, don't let this guy fool you.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.886
He may be a butler,
butlers know powerful people.

13:11.960 --> 13:13.405
If we don't play this just right,

13:13.520 --> 13:15.841
he'll have a dozen lawyers
down here by lunch.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.251
What about the stolen-car report?

13:17.920 --> 13:20.207
Currently lost in the system.

13:20.600 --> 13:21.886
But if the car
was actually stolen,

13:21.960 --> 13:23.291
we got nothing to use on him.

13:23.360 --> 13:26.682
Eh, we got something that'll
rattle this limey's cage good.

13:27.320 --> 13:28.890
<i>I'll tell you,
you know what I would do</i>

13:28.960 --> 13:32.248
if the bumper fell off my car
while I was committing a crime?

13:33.200 --> 13:34.884
I'd file a stolen-car report.

13:35.560 --> 13:37.244
Well, if you're implying
that Mr. Stark would ever...

13:37.320 --> 13:38.970
I'm implying you.

13:40.160 --> 13:41.889
Mr. Stark's on the run.

13:41.960 --> 13:45.089
He is also an innocent man.

13:54.240 --> 13:56.561
I can see why he hired you.

13:57.440 --> 14:00.364
You're smart, cool-headed,
extremely loyal,

14:01.080 --> 14:02.366
which is surprising,

14:02.440 --> 14:04.169
considering you were
charged with treason.

14:09.400 --> 14:10.970
There you go. Stay on him.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.644
<i>Oh, yeah. It's right here.</i>

14:12.720 --> 14:14.643
<i>There's not much in there.</i>

14:14.720 --> 14:16.245
<i>But seeing as whatever you did's</i>

14:16.320 --> 14:17.685
been swept under a rug, I'm guessing

14:17.760 --> 14:20.969
it's a big green one
made of Stark money, hmm?

14:23.960 --> 14:26.964
So, you dodged the treason conviction.

14:29.520 --> 14:32.444
But you couldn't get out
of the dishonorable discharge.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.609
Well, I guess
money can't buy everything.

14:36.560 --> 14:37.721
This looks bad,

14:37.800 --> 14:40.963
bad to every good man
who ever served,

14:41.560 --> 14:43.961
bad to your friends, neighbors...

14:46.160 --> 14:49.801
And to the fine folks
at the office of immigration.

14:51.640 --> 14:54.484
<i>Yeah, I'm putting that on the table.</i>

14:56.080 --> 14:58.401
That'll be a fun conversation
to have with the wife.

14:58.640 --> 14:59.721
Yeah?

15:00.560 --> 15:02.369
"Honey, pack a bag.

15:02.440 --> 15:04.090
"Spot of bother.

15:04.160 --> 15:06.162
<i>"We're being deported."</i>

15:08.320 --> 15:09.924
<i>You know what?
Let's get her on the phone.</i>

15:10.000 --> 15:11.331
<i>I'll tell her myself.</i>

15:11.920 --> 15:14.366
You leave my wife out of this.

15:14.440 --> 15:18.331
You dragged her into it when you
broke the law with your boss.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.084
You pay, she pays.

15:22.960 --> 15:24.007
Hmm.

15:25.080 --> 15:26.366
He's about to fold.

15:26.440 --> 15:27.521
And admit what?

15:27.600 --> 15:29.921
If I had my way, damn near everything.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.048
This guy washes Stark's underwear.

15:32.160 --> 15:33.366
He knows.

15:35.320 --> 15:36.731
Hey, it's just getting good.

15:37.120 --> 15:38.690
I should get back to my station.

15:40.200 --> 15:43.124
<i>I'm sure the last thing you
want is to put Anna on a plane</i>

15:43.200 --> 15:44.690
<i>and have to explain why.</i>

15:50.560 --> 15:53.211
All right, I'll let you take my shift.

16:00.400 --> 16:03.483
It's a one-time offer, Carter.

16:03.560 --> 16:04.721
Carter!

16:06.800 --> 16:07.801
Excuse me, Chief Dooley.

16:07.880 --> 16:09.041
I need your signature, sir.

16:09.880 --> 16:11.564
What? Can't it wait?

16:11.880 --> 16:13.769
I'm afraid the codes
are ready for analysis.

16:13.840 --> 16:14.966
I need your approval.

16:25.920 --> 16:27.365
 Thank you.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.765
<i>Why don't you sit here awhile?</i>

16:33.000 --> 16:34.161
Think about it.

16:34.240 --> 16:35.765
I'm gonna get a coffee.
You want something?

16:38.240 --> 16:39.765
That's my cue.

16:51.120 --> 16:52.804
What do you think?

16:52.880 --> 16:54.086
I think he's on the verge of telling you

16:54.200 --> 16:56.089
what Stark had for breakfast
two months ago.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.611
- Really nice, Jack.
- Mmm-hmm.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.764
You feel him sweat?

16:59.840 --> 17:02.286
Wife's the key. Stay on the wife.

17:05.839 --> 17:07.079
Mr. Jarvis, I want you to meet...

17:07.160 --> 17:08.207
Chief Dooley,

17:08.280 --> 17:11.602
I'm afraid I mistakenly took
your stolen-car report.

17:14.640 --> 17:18.531
Well, thank you
for your hospitality, gentlemen.

17:19.119 --> 17:20.406
Unless you're going to
arrest and charge me,

17:20.480 --> 17:22.164
I'll be on my way.

17:22.839 --> 17:24.285
If there's anything further
you'd like to discuss,

17:24.359 --> 17:26.931
please feel free to contact
one of Mr. Stark's attorneys.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.368
Do you have any idea
how stupid that was?

17:36.440 --> 17:38.090
- I didn't...
- Exactly. You didn't think.

17:38.520 --> 17:40.249
For the love of Eve,
will somebody tell me what I did,

17:40.320 --> 17:43.403
who I cheesed off
to have you dumped in my lap?

17:44.240 --> 17:47.084
And you wonder why you never
catch any actual assignments.

17:49.280 --> 17:50.327
Hey.

17:56.320 --> 17:57.890
You see this man?

17:57.960 --> 18:01.009
He did exemplary work today,
and you ruined it.

18:01.520 --> 18:03.170
Now, what do you have to say to him?

18:05.200 --> 18:06.690
Agent Thompson, I apologize.

18:07.560 --> 18:10.769
Agent Carter, sorry doesn't even
begin to cover it.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.480
Doesn't even begin to cover it.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.369
Get out of my sight.

18:15.640 --> 18:16.687
Sir.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.923
Oh, I've been on my feet
so long, I've sprouted roots.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.367
Hello, Angie, sorry. I was, I...

18:58.440 --> 19:00.807
An eight-hour shift, and I got
a whole 50 cents in tips.

19:00.880 --> 19:02.928
The war's over. I thought we
were all spending money again.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.081
How was your day?

19:04.320 --> 19:06.402
Well, 50 cents in tips would have been
a considerable improvement.

19:07.080 --> 19:08.809
I got a bottle of schnapps
and half a rhubarb pie.

19:08.880 --> 19:10.484
Let's see which one makes us sick first.

19:10.560 --> 19:12.483
Oh, sounds lovely,
but I was just about to go to bed.

19:12.560 --> 19:14.847
It's 8:00, Grandma. Come on.
Tell me about your crappy day.

19:14.920 --> 19:15.921
Maybe it'll make me feel better.

19:16.240 --> 19:18.766
I'm really tired. Maybe some other time.

19:23.320 --> 19:24.526
Didn't mean to disturb you.

19:24.640 --> 19:26.324
- No, you didn't disturb me. I just...
- No, it's fine.

19:26.400 --> 19:27.925
I know a brush-off when I see it.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.525
- Angie...
- Oh.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.682
Ah, Miss Carter, Miss Martinelli,

19:31.760 --> 19:35.207
may I introduce you to our new resident,
Miss Dorothy Underwood?

19:35.280 --> 19:36.520
Oh, call me Dottie.

19:36.960 --> 19:38.485
Nice to meet you.

19:38.560 --> 19:39.891
- This place is pretty swell, huh?
- Hmm.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.805
Seems like one big, happy family.

19:41.880 --> 19:44.645
- That wears off.
- No, it's a pleasure to meet you.

19:44.720 --> 19:47.644
I love your accent. England, right?

19:48.760 --> 19:50.364
I've never met anybody from there.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.522
Miss Underwood hails
from Iowa

19:52.680 --> 19:54.603
and is pursuing a ballet career.

19:54.680 --> 19:58.048
Typically, I find dancers
too carefree and irresponsible,

19:58.120 --> 20:01.761
though I have always appreciated
the discipline of ballet.

20:02.480 --> 20:04.130
Nice to meet you, Dot.

20:04.240 --> 20:06.402
Uh, I didn't mean to interrupt.

20:06.480 --> 20:08.084
No harm. Wasn't much more to say.

20:08.160 --> 20:10.242
- I'm sure you'll be very happy here.

20:11.240 --> 20:12.321
Uh...

20:20.320 --> 20:21.890
Do you have anything
you want to tell me?

20:23.840 --> 20:25.205
Not at present, no.

20:26.920 --> 20:27.967
Very well.

20:28.480 --> 20:30.369
Let's get on with it.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.210
Mr. Stark believed the intruder

20:42.280 --> 20:44.567
had some advanced
technological assistance.

20:44.680 --> 20:46.284
Mr. Stark believes brushing your teeth

20:46.360 --> 20:49.204
requires advanced
technological assistance.

20:52.680 --> 20:53.966
Shall we?

21:06.200 --> 21:07.645
You've done this before.

21:07.720 --> 21:09.802
Himalayas before the war.

21:10.240 --> 21:11.651
Though, at that time,
I was strapped

21:11.720 --> 21:13.848
to a very amusing Spaniard named...

21:16.760 --> 21:17.761
You are, of course,

21:17.880 --> 21:20.565
well within your rights
to maintain your privacy.

21:20.640 --> 21:22.369
Thank you. I agree.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.248
A charge of treason, out of context,

21:26.320 --> 21:28.288
is not necessarily what it appears to be.

21:28.360 --> 21:29.327
Quite so.

21:29.400 --> 21:32.324
In fact, my involvement
with you and Mr. Stark could,

21:32.400 --> 21:34.323
on the face of it,
be considered treasonous.

21:34.400 --> 21:35.561
Indeed, it could.

21:35.640 --> 21:38.246
I don't need to know the details
of your past, Mr. Jarvis.

21:38.320 --> 21:40.004
I appreciate that. Thank you.

21:42.040 --> 21:44.441
Our investigators found an open
manhole cover five blocks away.

21:44.520 --> 21:46.409
They assume the thief came up there.

21:46.480 --> 21:47.925
Carrying hundreds
of pounds of equipment?

21:48.000 --> 21:49.570
Seems unlikely.

21:50.320 --> 21:52.448
You said it rained
the night of the break-in.

21:52.800 --> 21:54.802
It was a positive deluge. Why?

21:54.880 --> 21:56.405
New York is one of the last cities

21:56.480 --> 21:59.006
to still use its sewers
to run off storm water.

21:59.080 --> 22:00.491
When the tunnels are full,
the tide gate opens

22:00.560 --> 22:01.971
and the water runs into the river.

22:02.400 --> 22:05.643
All Mr. Brannis would have needed
is a raft and a forecast.

22:05.760 --> 22:10.322
He could have floated his stolen
treasure all the way to the sea.

22:19.320 --> 22:22.563
I'm heading out. Make sure the chief
gets this when he gets back.

22:22.640 --> 22:24.085
You got a hit on my passports?

22:24.200 --> 22:26.168
Prince Charming's name
is Sasha Demidov.

22:26.280 --> 22:27.441
You might know the rest of the story.

22:27.520 --> 22:28.965
Let me guess.
He was dead before he died,

22:29.040 --> 22:30.530
Battle of... Wherever?

22:30.720 --> 22:33.291
Finow. Congrats, Sousa.

22:33.640 --> 22:34.846
You are the brains of the night shift.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.206
You ladies have a good night.

22:36.280 --> 22:38.123
You know, the passports
were a gift from me.

22:38.200 --> 22:41.283
Least you could do is
cover my shift, you rat bastard.

22:42.120 --> 22:43.281
Thought you were gonna ask Carter.

22:43.720 --> 22:45.404
I was. I did.

22:45.480 --> 22:47.562
She acted like I was waving
a sock in front of her face.

22:47.640 --> 22:49.608
I'm sure you were polite
and respectful as always.

22:51.240 --> 22:52.730
You sweet on her, Sousa?

22:53.920 --> 22:55.809
Don't you have enough women
in your life to worry about?

22:56.120 --> 23:00.205
All right, I'm gonna give you
a nickel's worth of free advice, pal.

23:00.280 --> 23:01.281
Give it up.

23:01.960 --> 23:04.725
No girl's gonna trade in
a red, white, and blue shield

23:04.800 --> 23:05.926
for an aluminum crutch.

23:08.880 --> 23:11.850
Your knowledge of waste removal
rather surprises me.

23:11.920 --> 23:14.400
I spent a week down here
in the winter of '42.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.323
It was... Another time, perhaps.

23:16.400 --> 23:18.801
After all, we all have secrets.

23:21.240 --> 23:23.322
I was wrong. I need to know.

23:24.080 --> 23:25.081
Miss Carter...

23:25.160 --> 23:27.527
If we're going to be working together,
risking our lives together,

23:27.600 --> 23:29.090
then I must be able to trust you.

23:30.080 --> 23:31.411
On my honor, you can.

23:31.480 --> 23:33.209
Your honor is not enough.

23:35.040 --> 23:37.964
Mr. Stark deemed me worthy of his trust.

23:38.040 --> 23:39.121
I would hope that would suffice.

23:39.200 --> 23:42.010
Mr. Stark would trust
a shark to not bite him

23:42.080 --> 23:43.923
if it was wearing a short enough skirt.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.207
That's not entirely relevant.

23:47.680 --> 23:49.489
Would it satisfy you to know that

23:49.560 --> 23:51.244
the charge of treason
was dropped almost immediately?

23:52.040 --> 23:53.530
It's a start.

23:57.200 --> 24:00.204
Before the war, I served under a general.

24:00.280 --> 24:02.408
We traveled a great deal.

24:02.480 --> 24:04.209
We were in Budapest when I met Anna.

24:04.880 --> 24:06.166
She worked in a hotel tailor shop,

24:06.240 --> 24:08.527
sold me the most beautiful tie.

24:10.160 --> 24:13.721
And then the war broke out,
and things became difficult.

24:14.440 --> 24:15.680
She was Jewish.

24:15.760 --> 24:18.206
Still is, I'm happy to say.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.771
The general carried several
letters of transit in his safe,

24:21.840 --> 24:24.491
any one of which would have
ensured her safety,

24:24.560 --> 24:25.686
but he refused to sign.

24:26.200 --> 24:27.645
You forged his name.

24:27.720 --> 24:29.449
Hence the dishonorable discharge.

24:29.840 --> 24:32.491
It was filing the papers that sunk me.

24:33.040 --> 24:35.725
I was arrested in the middle of Whitehall.

24:35.800 --> 24:38.246
Hmm. On a Tuesday.

24:39.240 --> 24:40.651
How did Anna get out?

24:41.920 --> 24:44.241
The same way I avoided the noose.

24:45.240 --> 24:46.241
Howard?

24:46.320 --> 24:48.607
Mr. Stark had unfinished business
with the general,

24:48.680 --> 24:50.967
and he and I had always got along.

24:51.040 --> 24:54.010
When he heard of my predicament, he...

24:54.080 --> 24:55.525
Used his influence.

24:55.600 --> 24:56.886
Sounds like a story.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.250
Another time, perhaps.

25:05.680 --> 25:07.569
Anna obviously knows
what Howard did for you,

25:07.640 --> 25:09.529
but she doesn't know
what you do for him?

25:09.600 --> 25:11.284
Not recently, no.

25:11.920 --> 25:15.606
I may not always be truthful with Anna,
but I am always honest.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.205
Difficult balance, that.

25:17.280 --> 25:19.442
One that I imagine you know all too well.

25:19.760 --> 25:20.761
Here we are.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.411
Mr. Brannis couldn't have gone very far

25:27.480 --> 25:30.484
with a whole raft full
of volatile technology.

25:31.320 --> 25:32.651
Not far at all.

25:35.880 --> 25:37.484
Mr. Brannis' symbol.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.450
Well, she looks to have
seen better days.

26:09.520 --> 26:11.443
It's still connected to the electric.
Someone's using it.

26:13.480 --> 26:15.130
Do you have another one of those?

26:16.000 --> 26:18.401
Someone's getting very confident.

26:51.120 --> 26:52.201
Hmm.

27:36.560 --> 27:37.766
Bingo.

27:37.840 --> 27:39.842
Careful. Some can be skittish.

27:39.920 --> 27:41.888
Very well aware of that.

27:49.920 --> 27:52.082
I remember you.

27:52.920 --> 27:55.002
- Nasty little bugger.
- What does he do?

27:55.120 --> 27:56.849
The constrictor causes

27:56.920 --> 27:59.127
involuntary catastrophic
muscle contraction.

27:59.200 --> 28:00.611
Bones break, I'm afraid.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.648
It was originally designed
for back massage.

28:03.720 --> 28:04.767
Hmm.

28:05.320 --> 28:06.924
Right. Let's call it in.

28:07.720 --> 28:10.371
Miss Carter, I'm not sure
you've thought this through.

28:10.840 --> 28:12.569
You can't reveal
that you found these items.

28:12.640 --> 28:14.483
I can't bloody well leave them here
for someone else to find.

28:14.560 --> 28:15.527
I'm not suggesting...

28:15.600 --> 28:16.601
I'm certainly not turning
them over to you

28:16.680 --> 28:18.091
to be stolen
the next time you feel sleepy.

28:20.200 --> 28:22.771
Agent Carter, how did you come
to discover the stolen items?

28:24.440 --> 28:26.647
Leet Brannis, uh, told me
where they were.

28:27.040 --> 28:28.929
And how did you come
into contact with Mr. Brannis?

28:29.320 --> 28:32.403
I have been conducting my own private
investigation with Howard Stark.

28:32.520 --> 28:34.204
What is your relationship
with Howard Stark?

28:34.280 --> 28:36.282
Have you been in contact with him
since his disappearance?

28:36.400 --> 28:40.041
Are you collaborating with Stark,
a known traitor and fugitive from justice?

28:41.800 --> 28:45.566
Publicly revealing these items
won't clear Mr. Stark's name.

28:45.640 --> 28:48.325
They'll only place you
under suspicion along with him.

28:49.080 --> 28:51.242
Do you see the day I've had?

28:52.000 --> 28:55.004
I will call them in,
and they will respect me.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.370
But they won't.

28:58.680 --> 29:01.331
They'll only use it to tear you down.

29:05.160 --> 29:08.846
If you wish to clear Mr. Stark's name,
you must do so from the shadows.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.685
There's a phone box across the street.

29:17.280 --> 29:18.611
Call it in.

29:18.680 --> 29:21.411
But for God's sake,
don't let Krzeminski get hold of it.

29:21.480 --> 29:22.686
Sousa's working the office tonight.

29:22.760 --> 29:25.206
I can just about stomach him
getting the credit.

29:27.200 --> 29:31.489
Oh, and, uh, Mr. Jarvis,
they know your voice now.

29:38.720 --> 29:42.202
- Sousa.

29:42.640 --> 29:43.971
<i>Hey, mack,</i>

29:44.520 --> 29:47.000
I, uh, got a hot tip for ya.

29:47.720 --> 29:48.801
What?

29:48.880 --> 29:51.611
Yeah, Howard Stark's
stolen inventions.

29:51.680 --> 29:54.524
They're... They're... They're on a boat

29:54.600 --> 29:56.887
near the south side pier...

29:57.160 --> 29:59.766
- The Heartbreak, <i>dock 12.</i>
- Who is this?

30:00.680 --> 30:02.045
Just a pal.

30:02.720 --> 30:04.370
Tell me your name...
How did you get this number?

30:04.840 --> 30:06.922
Have a lovely night.

30:10.680 --> 30:12.489
Right.

30:12.720 --> 30:14.085
Very good.

30:15.120 --> 30:17.327
- Who was that?
- Anonymous tip.

30:18.480 --> 30:19.561
Let's go.

30:21.360 --> 30:22.930
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

30:28.240 --> 30:30.129
- That didn't take long.

30:31.880 --> 30:32.927
Oh.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.361
Thought you were someone else.

30:47.040 --> 30:49.407
Brannis told me
one of you would be coming.

30:49.760 --> 30:51.091
One of me?

30:51.360 --> 30:53.010
And I'm not afraid to kill a woman.

30:53.280 --> 30:55.203
Would it make a difference if
I told you I won't make it easy?

30:55.280 --> 30:56.406
Yeah.

30:56.840 --> 30:58.285
He told me that, too.

31:53.680 --> 31:55.284
What did you do?

31:56.400 --> 31:57.731
What did you do to my arm?

31:59.600 --> 32:01.682
- Aah!

32:02.080 --> 32:03.411
Well, that works.

32:03.480 --> 32:04.641
Not if you want a massage.

32:10.160 --> 32:11.810
I imagine that'll be your colleagues.
We must go.

32:11.880 --> 32:13.041
We can't leave him here.
He's a witness.

32:13.160 --> 32:14.161
There's no time.

32:46.120 --> 32:47.770
You sure somebody's not
yanking your chain?

32:51.560 --> 32:52.971
There it is.

33:05.120 --> 33:06.724
SSR. Don't move.

33:07.720 --> 33:09.484
Don't think he can.

33:13.160 --> 33:15.049
This is it.

33:16.120 --> 33:17.690
We got the Stark stuff.

33:17.760 --> 33:19.046
That's like the whole haul.

33:19.120 --> 33:20.326
Ease up on that, will you?

33:20.400 --> 33:21.765
I don't want to end up inside out.

33:22.440 --> 33:24.044
We're getting promotions
out of this.

33:24.120 --> 33:26.122
Why? 'Cause we answered the phone?

33:26.440 --> 33:28.841
This got handed to us, again.

33:28.920 --> 33:31.002
Somebody's wrapping this up
like it's Christmas.

33:31.480 --> 33:33.847
Christmas? Well, hey,
who doesn't love Christmas?

33:34.320 --> 33:36.049
I'm gonna call Chief.

33:45.560 --> 33:47.801
I want every single box
checked and signed in.

33:50.440 --> 33:52.408
Careful with that, boys.

33:53.040 --> 33:54.530
Hey, keep it sealed off!

33:54.600 --> 33:55.601
- You got it!

33:56.080 --> 33:57.286
Who's our new helpful friend?

33:57.800 --> 33:59.006
Jerome Zandow.

33:59.080 --> 34:00.969
He had an act in a sideshow
at Coney Island.

34:02.280 --> 34:03.361
Petty crimes here and there.

34:03.440 --> 34:04.965
Probably just muscle for hire.

34:05.120 --> 34:06.531
Even muscle knows something.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.244
He had his hands on
an arsenal of Stark technology,

34:09.320 --> 34:11.049
but he just sat there with it.

34:11.120 --> 34:12.406
What's he waiting for?

34:13.280 --> 34:15.647
- I'll get it out of him.
- Crates are loaded up.

34:15.960 --> 34:18.485
I want a lead and a chase car.
Don't do the scenic route.

34:18.560 --> 34:20.847
Let's get it behind SSR walls ASAP.

34:21.320 --> 34:24.483
I'll wake up the eggheads, start
figuring out what the hell this stuff is.

34:24.560 --> 34:26.688
And, boys, drive carefully.

34:28.159 --> 34:29.924
I don't want to be the one
who sunk Manhattan.

34:38.360 --> 34:40.886
- I don't envy you, buddy.

34:40.960 --> 34:44.089
My pal Jack, he's got
a special gift for interrogations.

34:44.840 --> 34:48.128
He's real convincing,
gets guys to spill their guts.

34:48.760 --> 34:50.524
That's not an expression.
We've had to use a mop.

34:50.600 --> 34:53.524
I need a doc. My arm's broke.

34:54.040 --> 34:56.610
What's the point of fixing you up if
we're just gonna break you again?

34:57.960 --> 34:59.291
Was that dame working for you?

34:59.560 --> 35:01.847
- What dame?
- The one on the boat.

35:02.640 --> 35:04.961
English broad, solid right hook.

35:05.480 --> 35:07.767
- English?
- Yeah.

35:13.080 --> 35:14.605
- What's she look like?

35:14.680 --> 35:17.445
Oh, damn it! What the...

35:20.880 --> 35:21.881
Don't move.

35:24.680 --> 35:26.921
Watch where you're going.

35:27.720 --> 35:29.210
You're lucky this is a company car.

35:29.480 --> 35:30.481
- Hey.

35:30.560 --> 35:31.561
Ohh!

35:38.240 --> 35:40.049
I didn't tell him anything!
I didn't tell him nothing!

35:40.640 --> 35:42.290
- Not a thing, I...

36:04.680 --> 36:07.331
Thank you.

36:21.520 --> 36:23.648
Rose? What is it?

36:24.320 --> 36:26.926
Oh, Peggy. It's too awful.

36:54.600 --> 36:56.967
Really puts you
back there, doesn't it?

36:59.240 --> 37:03.689
Somebody buys it, you realize
it could happen anytime, any day.

37:04.200 --> 37:05.850
How did it happen?

37:07.200 --> 37:08.804
Professional hit.

37:09.480 --> 37:11.482
Him and our only witness.

37:12.160 --> 37:14.401
Must have been watching us
at the scene.

37:14.480 --> 37:17.245
I knew something was fishy about
that anonymous tip. Who does that?

37:18.240 --> 37:19.730
A concerned citizen?

37:19.840 --> 37:23.765
Concerned citizens call the cops.
This guy called us directly.

37:23.840 --> 37:24.921
It's not like we're in the phonebook.

37:26.360 --> 37:30.001
Somebody targeted them,
and I'm gonna find that bastard.

37:38.840 --> 37:43.323
Whatever happened last night,
don't any of you forget,

37:44.520 --> 37:48.002
Krzeminski would still be with us today
if it wasn't for Howard Stark,

37:48.080 --> 37:50.321
whether he pulled the trigger or not.

37:50.520 --> 37:53.251
We're only neck-deep
in this mess because of him.

37:55.080 --> 37:57.924
I want action plans on my desk
in one hour.

37:58.440 --> 38:01.489
Stay vigilant.
I'm not losing any more of you.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.009
Now I got to go call Krzeminski's wife.

38:14.280 --> 38:16.282
I'll call his girlfriend.

38:51.920 --> 38:53.160
The usual?

38:53.240 --> 38:54.401
Yes, please.

39:06.080 --> 39:07.411
Anything else?

39:07.960 --> 39:09.769
Uh...

39:12.120 --> 39:16.762
I... I thought I might tell you about
my day if you have a moment.

39:19.160 --> 39:21.686
Yeah, that would be a nice change.
I got plenty of time on my hands.

39:24.600 --> 39:25.886
All ears.

39:27.680 --> 39:32.766
Uh, it's just that...
One of my co-workers died today.

39:34.160 --> 39:35.571
Geez, Peg. That's too bad.

39:35.640 --> 39:38.120
- Right there on the job?
- Yes, it was sudden.

39:39.640 --> 39:41.529
I know how you feel. Blindsided.

39:41.720 --> 39:43.882
Like when my cousin Ralphie
got hit by a bus.

39:43.960 --> 39:45.883
Granted, he did just knock off
a newsstand, but still.

39:45.960 --> 39:47.086
Big shock.

39:47.160 --> 39:48.969
Oh, uh...

39:49.600 --> 39:52.206
I don't know why it's hit me so hard.

39:52.480 --> 39:53.766
We weren't close.

39:53.840 --> 39:57.367
He was... A brute, a cheat.

39:57.640 --> 39:59.847
He was disrespectful, rude...

40:01.480 --> 40:03.448
But he was good at his job.

40:04.480 --> 40:06.528
I'm really sorry, honey. What can I do?

40:06.960 --> 40:08.769
Miss, could I get a refill?

40:09.320 --> 40:13.405
Um, do you still have that schnapps?

40:14.080 --> 40:15.161
Miss?

40:16.280 --> 40:18.647
Let me get this jerk his refill,
and I'll clock out.

40:18.840 --> 40:21.764
I think that jerk
quite fancies you.

40:22.560 --> 40:24.210
Shut up, English. You talk too much.
