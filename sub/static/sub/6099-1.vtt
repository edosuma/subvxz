03:13.694 --> 03:16.070
That's a nice dress you're
wearing this morning, Misty.

03:16.071 --> 03:17.238
Thanks, Dad.

03:17.239 --> 03:20.449
- Want the entertainment section?
- Not yet, Dad, thanks.

03:20.450 --> 03:21.617
Got any donuts?

03:21.618 --> 03:22.702
Of course not, Chip.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.328
You know they're bad for the teeth.

03:24.329 --> 03:25.413
Always the dentist.

03:25.414 --> 03:27.456
Who wants fruit salad?

03:27.457 --> 03:28.749
Oh, I do, please.

03:29.793 --> 03:32.753
Misty, that's not gum
in your mouth, is it?

03:32.754 --> 03:34.501
It's sugarless.

03:36.007 --> 03:40.261
Misty, you know how I hate gum.
All that chomping and chewing.

03:40.262 --> 03:41.554
I'm sorry, Mom.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.638
All right.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.348
- Hey, Chip.
- Mmm?

03:44.349 --> 03:47.476
You think I could get 50 cents
for Village People on vinyl?

03:47.477 --> 03:48.936
You might get a buck.

03:48.937 --> 03:51.397
Carl can't believe how
much I make at swap meets.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.983
Who, may I ask, is Carl?

03:53.984 --> 03:55.317
Just a boy.

03:55.318 --> 03:57.570
He's picking me up this morning.

03:57.571 --> 03:58.904
Here we go again.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.865
He's really cute.

04:00.866 --> 04:03.033
Misty, cute is not enough.
You know that.

04:03.034 --> 04:04.618
She sure can pick them.

04:04.619 --> 04:07.329
He goes to college with me.

04:07.330 --> 04:11.501
Leave her alone, Chip. I think
it's great Misty's got a new beau.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.295
Chip, honey?

04:14.296 --> 04:15.379
Thanks, Mom.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.209
Listen to this.

04:19.885 --> 04:23.555
"Hillside Strangler gets his
college degree in prison."

04:24.181 --> 04:25.347
That's nice, dear.

04:25.348 --> 04:29.059
Nice? He should have been executed.

04:29.060 --> 04:32.313
Yeah, the death penalty.

04:32.314 --> 04:34.523
He killed people, Mom.

04:34.524 --> 04:36.192
We all have our bad days.

04:36.193 --> 04:39.278
You'd probably date him.
"He's cute!"

04:40.447 --> 04:42.698
All right, that's enough.

04:42.699 --> 04:45.284
Hey, Dad, have you ever seen
Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer?

04:45.285 --> 04:46.535
Oh, sure, Chip.

04:46.536 --> 04:48.579
I most certainly have not.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.917
You've been working in
that video shop too long.

04:52.918 --> 04:55.086
Mind your own business.

04:55.420 --> 04:59.089
Well, it better hadn't be
interfering with your schoolwork.

04:59.090 --> 05:01.342
I do great in school, Dad.

05:01.343 --> 05:04.512
Well, your mother has PTA today.

05:04.513 --> 05:06.514
We'll see what your
teacher has to say.

05:06.515 --> 05:08.474
Oh, Mom, I hate Mr. Stubbins.

05:08.475 --> 05:12.020
Don't say "hate," dear.
Hate is a very serious word.

05:23.865 --> 05:27.615
There! Scrambled eggs, anybody?

05:33.834 --> 05:35.627
Who on earth...

05:37.879 --> 05:39.964
- Mrs. Sutphin?
- Yes.

05:39.965 --> 05:42.716
I'm Detective Pike.
This is Detective Gracey.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.294
Oh, come in.

05:48.098 --> 05:51.433
I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What seems
to be the trouble, Officers?

05:51.434 --> 05:52.935
Is there a killer loose?

05:52.936 --> 05:54.478
No, son. Nothing that exciting.

05:54.479 --> 05:57.356
Oh, this is our son, Chip,
and our daughter, Misty.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.899
Hi.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.317
Jeez...

06:00.902 --> 06:02.319
Oh.

06:04.406 --> 06:08.327
Officer, I'm sorry, but we
don't allow gum in this house.

06:08.660 --> 06:10.453
Sorry, ma'am.

06:10.954 --> 06:14.790
We're investigating obscene
phone calls and mail threats

06:14.791 --> 06:17.668
to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.

06:17.669 --> 06:18.752
I know Dottie.

06:18.753 --> 06:20.087
She lives right down the street.

06:20.088 --> 06:21.171
Could you take a
look at this and...

06:21.172 --> 06:23.799
Tell us of anyone who
might be responsible?

06:23.800 --> 06:27.300
I should warn you, this
note contains language.

06:33.351 --> 06:34.723
Oh, my!

06:35.395 --> 06:37.396
That... That is the limit.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.814
Let me see.

06:38.815 --> 06:41.689
No, Son. This is a
matter for adults.

06:42.694 --> 06:45.321
Officers, I have never even
said the "P" word out loud,

06:45.322 --> 06:47.531
let alone have written it down.

06:47.532 --> 06:50.075
No woman would.

06:50.076 --> 06:53.329
Officers, life doesn't
have to be ugly.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.831
See, look at the birds out there.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.875
Listen to their call...

07:13.642 --> 07:14.808
Chip, there's your ride.

07:14.809 --> 07:17.519
Hey, I'm gonna be late for
work. Goodbye, honey.

07:17.520 --> 07:18.646
Okay.

07:18.647 --> 07:19.894
Excuse me.

07:21.358 --> 07:23.484
Hi, Scotty.

07:23.485 --> 07:24.777
Thanks for your time, everybody.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.730
Bye, Detective Pike.

07:28.073 --> 07:29.156
Hi, Birdie!

07:29.157 --> 07:30.991
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Sutphin.

07:30.992 --> 07:34.571
That's Birdie. She's a horror
nut, just like my son.

07:35.497 --> 07:38.540
Oh, Birdie, this is Detective
Gracey and Detective Pike.

07:38.541 --> 07:39.583
Hiya, boys.

07:39.584 --> 07:41.293
Bye-bye, honey!

07:41.294 --> 07:44.293
Good morning, Scott.

07:44.506 --> 07:46.632
Hey, Misty, look what I got.
A Pee-Wee Herman doll.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.467
Can you sell it for me
at the flea market?

07:48.468 --> 07:50.887
Wow! Still in the box! I sure can!

07:52.889 --> 07:55.467
Oh, God, here comes Carl.

08:00.063 --> 08:02.147
You must be Mrs. Sutphin.
Carl Pageant.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.442
Oh, yes. Misty's date.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.607
Well, more of a friend, really.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.939
- Take it easy, man.
- Bye.

08:10.073 --> 08:12.282
See what Birdie gave me to
sell at the flea market?

08:12.283 --> 08:14.535
That guy's a weirdo.
Come on, let's go.

08:14.536 --> 08:15.953
I'll take it.

08:18.123 --> 08:20.165
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, honey.

08:20.166 --> 08:24.378
Oh, Detectives? Here's something
you should be interested in.

08:24.379 --> 08:27.423
A grown boy who doesn't
wear his seatbelt.

08:34.472 --> 08:37.349
Christ, that one was
Beaver Cleaver's mother.

08:40.061 --> 08:41.352
Oh, leave her alone.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.438
Mrs. Sutphin's about as
normal and nice a lady

08:43.440 --> 08:45.233
as we're ever gonna find.

09:00.957 --> 09:02.041
Hello?

09:02.042 --> 09:03.959
Is this the Cocksucker residence?

09:03.960 --> 09:06.170
God damn you! Stop calling here.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.797
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?

09:08.798 --> 09:09.882
You bitch!

09:09.883 --> 09:13.007
Now let me check the
zip code. 212-fuck you!

09:15.221 --> 09:19.346
Beverly? Beverly,
darling? You home?

09:19.392 --> 09:22.686
The police are tracing this
call this very minute.

09:22.687 --> 09:25.898
Well, Dottie Hinkle, then why
aren't they here, huh, fuck-face?

09:25.899 --> 09:27.601
Fuck you!

09:31.488 --> 09:33.406
Beverly, you home?

09:34.616 --> 09:36.534
I know you are.

09:41.623 --> 09:43.200
Beverly?

09:44.334 --> 09:45.660
Hmm.

09:53.301 --> 09:54.843
Didn't I just say fuck you?

09:54.844 --> 09:57.471
I beg your pardon.

09:57.472 --> 09:58.764
Who is this?

09:58.765 --> 10:01.100
Mrs. Wilson from the
telephone company.

10:01.101 --> 10:05.354
I understand you're having problems
with an obscene phone caller?

10:05.355 --> 10:09.399
Yes, I am. I'm sorry, Mrs. Wilson,
but this is driving me crazy.

10:09.400 --> 10:12.027
I've had my number
changed twice already.

10:12.028 --> 10:14.230
I'm a divorced woman.
Please help me.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.074
Beverly?

10:26.876 --> 10:30.546
Well, what exactly does this
sick individual say to you?

10:30.547 --> 10:33.924
I can't say the words out loud.
I don't use bad language.

10:33.925 --> 10:37.594
Oh, well, I know it's difficult, but
we need to know the exact words.

10:37.595 --> 10:39.092
I'll try.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.932
Cocksucker. That's
what she calls me.

10:41.933 --> 10:44.393
Listen to your filthy
mouth, you fucking whore!

10:44.394 --> 10:45.853
God damn you!

10:51.151 --> 10:52.234
Motherfucker.

10:52.235 --> 10:55.028
Cocksucker!

10:55.029 --> 10:56.738
- Beverly?
- Rosemary.

10:56.739 --> 10:58.240
Are you all right?

10:58.241 --> 11:00.443
Oh, yes, of course. I'm fine.

11:00.952 --> 11:02.703
Oh, how nice. You remembered.

11:02.704 --> 11:04.827
It's the least I could do.

11:05.540 --> 11:07.749
I heard shouting.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.210
Oh, it's that cable TV company.

11:10.211 --> 11:12.004
You know how they are.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.964
Did you hear about
poor Dottie Hinkle?

11:13.965 --> 11:16.049
Yes, I did. It's terrifying.

11:16.050 --> 11:18.093
The police were at my
house this morning.

11:18.094 --> 11:21.889
Now who on earth would want
to harass poor Dottie Hinkle?

11:56.299 --> 11:58.501
Bye-bye.

12:31.626 --> 12:34.711
But, Mr. Stubbins, my son
studies every night.

12:34.712 --> 12:37.172
He's trying as hard as he can.

12:37.173 --> 12:40.842
Well, some teenagers just aren't
college material, Mrs. Taplotter.

12:40.843 --> 12:42.761
It's nothing to cry over.

12:42.804 --> 12:46.014
Now, there are other
parents waiting.

12:46.015 --> 12:48.843
Thank you for taking the
time to come to PTA.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.604
- Hi, Betty.
- Oh, hi, Beverly.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.147
Oh, I love your outfit.

12:54.148 --> 12:55.357
Oh, thanks.

12:55.358 --> 12:56.901
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:57.026 --> 12:59.069
Liz Claiborne.

12:59.237 --> 13:01.405
Well, Mrs. Sutphin, where's
that husband of yours?

13:01.406 --> 13:04.234
Feeling a little down in the mouth?

13:06.703 --> 13:09.371
Oh, Ralph. You're so funny.

13:09.372 --> 13:11.245
Oh, brother.

13:13.543 --> 13:15.127
Mrs. Sutphin?

13:15.128 --> 13:16.500
Yes, right here.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.138
Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul
Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.056
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.

13:28.057 --> 13:29.599
Here's a little
something that I made.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.801
Oh.

13:32.061 --> 13:35.063
Fruitcake. Well, thank
you, Mrs. Sutphin.

13:35.064 --> 13:36.686
Have a seat.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.277
Oh, yes.

13:40.278 --> 13:42.070
Well, Chip's off to a
fine start this year.

13:42.071 --> 13:46.366
He's focused, conscientious, he participates
actively in classroom discussions...

13:46.367 --> 13:48.118
He's a good boy.

13:48.119 --> 13:49.995
There is one big problem, though.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.204
What is it?

13:51.205 --> 13:54.750
His unhealthy obsession
with sick horror films.

13:54.751 --> 13:56.668
Oh, no.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.587
Chip's the assistant manager
at a video store...

13:58.588 --> 14:01.715
That's no excuse for a
morbid imagination.

14:01.716 --> 14:04.544
I caught him drawing
this in class last week.

14:06.095 --> 14:08.096
Is there a problem at home?

14:08.097 --> 14:09.598
Of course not.

14:09.599 --> 14:12.473
Divorce? Alcoholic relative?

14:13.353 --> 14:16.355
Tell me, did Chip torture
animals when he was young?

14:16.356 --> 14:18.273
No, he did not.

14:18.274 --> 14:21.318
Mr. Stubbins, we are a loving
and supportive family.

14:21.986 --> 14:25.113
Well, you're doing something
wrong, Mrs. Sutphin.

14:25.114 --> 14:27.817
I'd recommend therapy for your son.

14:28.368 --> 14:31.538
Thank you for taking the
time to come to PTA.

16:01.711 --> 16:03.462
- Watch this.
- No, thanks.

16:03.463 --> 16:04.789
Scotty, watch this.

16:06.883 --> 16:09.718
It's a sheep's tongue.

16:09.719 --> 16:12.804
This shit is sickening.
Come on, put on some pussy.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.473
Look, dickhead...

16:15.558 --> 16:17.635
Blood Feast.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.479
The Citizen Kane of gore movies.

16:25.526 --> 16:29.237
I don't know what it is about
today, but I feel great! Cookie?

16:29.238 --> 16:31.406
Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.

16:31.407 --> 16:33.116
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.

16:33.117 --> 16:34.739
Hi, guys.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.662
Look how fake that looks.

16:37.663 --> 16:41.124
Oh, you kids. Here, have a
cookie and run on home.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.584
But, Mom, the video's not over.

16:42.585 --> 16:44.002
Don't you "but, Mom" me.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.588
Mr. Stubbins seems to think
that these silly movies

16:46.589 --> 16:48.590
are interfering with
your schoolwork.

16:48.591 --> 16:49.792
Oh, boy.

16:49.884 --> 16:52.177
Mom, Mr. Stubbins sucks.

16:52.178 --> 16:55.096
Man! That one made me puke!

16:55.097 --> 16:56.932
It's supposed to make you puke.

16:56.933 --> 16:59.101
You forgot something.

16:59.602 --> 17:00.685
Are we leaving?

17:00.686 --> 17:02.354
Yes, you are.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.522
Bye, Mrs. Sutphin.

17:03.523 --> 17:04.897
Bye, Birdie.

17:04.898 --> 17:07.443
Bye, Bird-Brain. See you, Scotty.

17:12.949 --> 17:17.780
Now, Chip, honey, I know how
hard it is being a teenager.

17:18.621 --> 17:22.121
I understand. I'm your
mother and I love you.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.084
Mom...

17:24.085 --> 17:25.377
Oh, could we watch
that scene again?

17:25.377 --> 17:29.833
You know the one, where he
rips her heart out? Please?

17:39.809 --> 17:42.477
Ladies and gentlemen,
the perfect meatloaf.

17:42.478 --> 17:43.979
It looks good, Mom.

17:43.980 --> 17:46.481
Nothing like a
home-cooked meal, honey.

17:46.482 --> 17:49.150
Oh, Misty, I made you your
favorite, sesame broccoli.

17:49.151 --> 17:51.111
You know, Carl says
if I lose 10 pounds,

17:51.112 --> 17:54.489
he'll take me to the University of
Maryland Memorial Day Beach Blast.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.825
Well, honey, I think that's
great if you wanna lose weight,

17:56.826 --> 18:01.163
but I think you should do it for yourself,
not for some boy you hardly even know.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.790
Carl's a jerk.

18:03.791 --> 18:05.868
He certainly drives like a jerk.

18:06.627 --> 18:09.838
Carl makes me happy and that
threatens this family, doesn't it?

18:09.839 --> 18:12.257
It doesn't threaten me,
honey. I'm happy.

18:12.258 --> 18:13.710
I'm happy, too.

18:14.176 --> 18:16.720
We just want you to be happy.

18:16.721 --> 18:18.763
I'm so happy I could shit.

18:18.764 --> 18:22.389
Chip, you know how I
hate the brown word.

18:24.353 --> 18:28.057
Beverly! Beverly!

18:32.153 --> 18:33.361
Beverly!

18:33.362 --> 18:36.361
That's Rosemary.
Something must be wrong.

18:37.700 --> 18:41.786
Turn on the news. A teacher at
your school has been murdered.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.989
- Murdered?
- Who?

18:44.040 --> 18:46.333
A Mr. Stuber or Stubin...

18:46.334 --> 18:47.581
Mr. Stubbins!

18:47.627 --> 18:51.422
That's my math teacher. Dad...

18:51.797 --> 18:52.922
Which channel?

18:52.923 --> 18:54.545
It's on all of them!

18:58.220 --> 19:00.180
Police claim the driver of
the hit-and-run vehicle

19:01.182 --> 19:02.891
- ran down the teacher in cold blood.
- Hello?

19:02.892 --> 19:04.351
- Did you hear?
- What happened?

19:04.352 --> 19:06.853
This is so cool. It's
just like a horror movie.

19:06.854 --> 19:09.689
- It's on. I'll call you back.
- Okay, bye.

19:09.690 --> 19:12.108
Mr. Paul Stubbins was 38 years old.

19:12.109 --> 19:14.235
Whoever did this should
get the death penalty.

19:14.236 --> 19:17.614
So far only one
eyewitness has surfaced.

19:17.615 --> 19:19.658
Young lady, what did you see?

19:19.659 --> 19:20.742
It was a blue car.

19:20.743 --> 19:22.410
That's Lu-Ann Hodges.

19:22.411 --> 19:23.745
She's a stoner.

19:23.746 --> 19:24.829
A what?

19:24.830 --> 19:26.081
A pothead, Mom.

19:26.082 --> 19:28.416
A blue station wagon.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.251
That's like your car, Beverly.

19:30.252 --> 19:32.504
Rosemary, I'm not
that bad a driver.

19:32.505 --> 19:33.755
In a second, man.

19:33.756 --> 19:36.549
It flattened Mr. Stubbins
just like a pancake!

19:36.550 --> 19:39.260
Oh, God, man, puke time, man.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.387
Oh, look at her hair.

19:40.388 --> 19:42.764
Blood was all over the place and...

19:42.765 --> 19:44.433
Turn it off, honey.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.936
I can't believe
Mr. Stubbins is dead.

19:47.937 --> 19:49.479
You said you hated him.

19:49.480 --> 19:53.150
Well, he was an asshole, but
he didn't deserve to die.

19:57.863 --> 20:01.067
I can't stop thinking
about that poor teacher.

20:03.869 --> 20:07.247
Well, good night, honey.

20:07.248 --> 20:08.289
Good night, dear.

20:08.290 --> 20:09.916
Don't read too late.

20:09.917 --> 20:12.127
We've got a big day with
the birds tomorrow.

20:12.128 --> 20:14.212
Oh, I've identified

20:14.213 --> 20:17.667
every little birdie that we're gonna
see tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.

20:17.675 --> 20:19.718
Good night, honey.

20:25.266 --> 20:28.310
Hey, don't I get a good night kiss?

20:30.479 --> 20:32.814
I thought with all this
sadness, you wouldn't wanna...

20:32.815 --> 20:36.565
We have to concentrate
on life, Eugene.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.408
It's all right with me, Beverly.

20:48.497 --> 20:50.699
You want to, honey?

20:51.876 --> 20:53.793
You think the kids are awake?

20:53.794 --> 20:55.792
We could be very quiet.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.839
I love that you're my wife.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.674
You're not so bad
yourself, cuckoo bird.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.923
You bring me such peace.

21:13.439 --> 21:16.062
Don't wake the kids.

21:20.988 --> 21:23.490
Oh, honey, you are hot tonight.

21:23.491 --> 21:24.699
Oh, yeah!

21:24.700 --> 21:26.618
Quiet!

21:28.329 --> 21:29.826
Oh, yeah!

21:33.876 --> 21:35.293
Yeah!

21:35.836 --> 21:39.631
Oh, get it! Honey, I'm ready!

21:40.299 --> 21:42.634
Now! Now...

21:42.635 --> 21:46.430
Oh, yeah! Yes!

21:46.555 --> 21:49.554
Now!

21:55.314 --> 21:58.609
Oh, there's DeeDee. Oh,
she's my favorite starling.

21:59.235 --> 22:00.902
She's here every
morning for breakfast.

22:00.903 --> 22:04.489
Well, honey, starlings are
originally from Europe, you know.

22:04.490 --> 22:05.782
No wonder DeeDee's hungry.

22:05.783 --> 22:09.203
It's a long journey all the
way here to Baltimore.

22:19.880 --> 22:20.964
Hello?

22:20.965 --> 22:23.466
Eugene, this is Ralph Sterner.
I've got a dental emergency here.

22:23.467 --> 22:26.386
I mean, this goddamn
tooth is killing me.

22:26.387 --> 22:28.721
Well, Mr. Sterner, if
you'll just call my office,

22:28.722 --> 22:30.765
I'm sure we can see you on Monday.

22:30.766 --> 22:33.268
Monday?

22:33.269 --> 22:35.270
Eugene, this is Betty Sterner.

22:35.271 --> 22:36.479
He'll die by Monday.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.106
I mean, the roots are infected.

22:38.107 --> 22:40.775
He might have a heart attack.

22:40.776 --> 22:43.479
All right, Mrs. Sterner. 10:00.

22:44.280 --> 22:48.451
I'm sorry, honey, but the birds
will still be there next week.

22:49.118 --> 22:51.821
It's okay. I understand.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.448
I'll go fix breakfast.

23:05.009 --> 23:06.134
Chip!

23:06.135 --> 23:08.636
God! Mom, what's the matter?

23:08.637 --> 23:11.931
Oh, it's just time to get up, that's all.
I don't want you to be late for work.

23:11.932 --> 23:13.600
You scared me.

23:14.977 --> 23:16.978
Misty, honey, what's wrong?

23:16.979 --> 23:18.479
I'm stood up.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.478
I'll kill that bastard.

23:23.611 --> 23:24.861
I mean it.

23:24.862 --> 23:27.322
He should be dead,
that lousy creep.

23:27.323 --> 23:31.027
He told me he'd be here.
I'll kill him.

23:32.661 --> 23:36.741
Don't use words unless you
mean them, Misty, honey.

23:37.666 --> 23:39.584
It's him!

23:39.585 --> 23:41.378
No, no. It's the police.

23:46.842 --> 23:48.385
Good morning, Officers.

23:49.178 --> 23:51.471
Good morning, Mrs. Sutphin.

23:51.472 --> 23:54.265
Hi, Detective Pike.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.558
Morning, Misty.

23:56.560 --> 23:59.354
Mrs. Sutphin, I presume you know
about the death of Mr. Stubbins.

23:59.355 --> 24:03.776
Oh, yes, yes. A fine
man, a good teacher.

24:04.652 --> 24:08.902
Contusions, fractures, rupture
of numerous vital organs.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.573
What a mess.

24:13.535 --> 24:16.079
Oh, no, no, honey. That's Scotty.

24:16.121 --> 24:19.074
Scotty, who doesn't
wear his seatbelt.

24:20.501 --> 24:21.873
Good morning, Detectives.

24:22.503 --> 24:24.545
Nightmare on Calverton Court.

24:24.546 --> 24:26.881
The Maryland Teacher Massacre.

24:26.882 --> 24:28.584
It's not funny, son.

24:29.885 --> 24:34.135
Did you drive your car to the PTA
meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?

24:34.181 --> 24:36.349
Yes, I did.

24:36.350 --> 24:38.226
Detectives, what is this all about?

24:38.227 --> 24:40.853
I know this sounds
weird, Mr. Sutphin,

24:40.854 --> 24:44.357
but the Department of Motor Vehicles
computer shows only one blue station wagon

24:44.358 --> 24:48.111
registered to a parent of any
of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.

24:48.112 --> 24:50.780
Surely, you don't think that
Beverly was involved in this?

24:50.781 --> 24:52.073
She did it!

24:52.074 --> 24:54.575
Aimed the car right at
Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!

24:56.412 --> 24:58.239
Shut up, Scotty.

24:59.999 --> 25:05.837
Well, as I understand it, the
only eyewitness was a drug user.

25:05.838 --> 25:09.048
I got somebody you could
run over, Mother.

25:09.049 --> 25:11.968
Misty, that's a
terrible thing to say.

25:12.177 --> 25:15.176
Detectives, it's time
for you to leave.

25:15.222 --> 25:18.349
My wife knows nothing about
this terrible accident.

25:18.350 --> 25:19.851
Murder, honey.

25:19.852 --> 25:23.312
Oh! Now here's a babe.

25:23.313 --> 25:25.641
Let's see that, young man.

25:29.611 --> 25:31.070
"P," as in...

25:31.071 --> 25:33.156
People who don't mind
their own business.

25:33.157 --> 25:35.826
Darling, it's Rosemary Ackerman's.

25:37.119 --> 25:39.662
Oh, you can tell by the
subscription label.

25:39.663 --> 25:43.291
I don't like to read about movies.
They're so violent.

25:43.292 --> 25:46.245
Besides, I always
recycle my magazines.

26:04.813 --> 26:08.316
<i>Daybreak if you wanna believe</i>

26:08.317 --> 26:12.904
<i>It can be daybreak
Ain't no time to grieve</i>

26:12.905 --> 26:17.200
<i>'Cause it's daybreak
If you'll only believe</i>

26:17.201 --> 26:21.406
<i>And let it shine, shine, shine</i>

26:51.693 --> 26:57.400
Wait for me, boys! Here! All
rinsed and ready to recycle.

26:57.574 --> 26:58.699
Morning, Mrs. Sutphin.

26:58.700 --> 27:01.577
Good morning, Gus.
Good morning, Sloppy.

27:01.578 --> 27:03.579
You know, you boys work so
hard for the environment,

27:03.580 --> 27:05.164
I thought I'd bring you something.

27:05.165 --> 27:06.958
A little drink never hurt anybody.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.786
Thank you, ma'am.

27:10.963 --> 27:13.214
Damn, that's good stuff.

27:13.215 --> 27:16.843
You believe that
goddamn litterbugger?

27:16.844 --> 27:18.761
I have told her and told her.

27:18.762 --> 27:22.390
It takes 90 to 100 years
for a tin canto decompose

27:22.391 --> 27:24.642
and she still won't recycle.

27:24.643 --> 27:27.186
It cost the taxpayers millions
of dollars last year,

27:27.187 --> 27:30.766
but she don't care nothing
about the national budget.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.234
I hate Mrs. Ackerman.

27:33.235 --> 27:34.694
I hate her, too.

27:34.695 --> 27:36.320
I hate her guts.

27:36.321 --> 27:39.491
You know, somebody
ought to kill her.

27:39.575 --> 27:41.576
Yeah.

27:41.577 --> 27:42.660
Give her a

27:43.745 --> 27:47.165
happy face, and then recycle her.

27:50.544 --> 27:53.918
For the sake of this planet,
somebody just might.

27:56.508 --> 28:00.720
But your boyfriend was convicted
of killing 12 people.

28:00.721 --> 28:01.929
I don't judge him.

28:03.015 --> 28:05.391
I just don't get it. I mean, how
can you love a mass murderer?

28:05.392 --> 28:10.063
Easy. He's handsome, he's famous
and we get conjugal visits.

28:12.399 --> 28:15.276
Serial hags. Women who
love men who mutilate.

28:15.277 --> 28:17.445
We'll be right back after
this, so please stay tuned.

28:17.446 --> 28:21.282
Turn it off. Violence is
everywhere these days.

28:21.283 --> 28:23.451
It's just Beverly.

28:23.452 --> 28:25.203
Come in, Beverly!

28:25.204 --> 28:26.996
Oh, she scared me.

28:26.997 --> 28:28.497
- Hi!
- Hi, Rosemary.

28:28.498 --> 28:29.624
Would you like a beer?

28:29.625 --> 28:32.543
Oh, no, no. Not me. Thank you.
Just a little coffee.

28:32.544 --> 28:36.088
Oh, Dottie, I'm so sorry.
I heard about your troubles.

28:36.089 --> 28:37.340
It's not fair.

28:37.341 --> 28:38.758
No.

28:39.593 --> 28:42.171
Mmm. Oh, thank you.

28:44.264 --> 28:47.141
Are those pussy willows?

28:47.142 --> 28:48.476
Dried ones.

28:48.477 --> 28:50.895
Aren't they pretty?

28:50.896 --> 28:53.224
What did you just say?

28:54.149 --> 28:57.023
Pussy willows, Dottie.

28:57.694 --> 29:00.947
Oh, my goodness!
What are you doing?

29:00.948 --> 29:02.156
I didn't do it!

29:02.157 --> 29:04.450
My Franklin Mint Fabergé egg!

29:04.451 --> 29:05.993
Dottie didn't mean to
be such a clumsy ox.

29:05.994 --> 29:07.453
You're sorry aren't you, Dottie?

29:07.454 --> 29:09.538
Rosemary, I did not break your egg!

29:09.539 --> 29:10.873
She did!

29:10.874 --> 29:13.084
Dottie, you could
at least apologize.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.752
I collect Franklin Mint!

29:14.753 --> 29:17.713
Well, we'll go right to the antique
market and we'll find you another one.

29:17.714 --> 29:21.425
Now, Misty tells me there's a whole
booth filled with Franklin Mint stuff.

29:21.426 --> 29:23.135
- But...
- Dottie, you'll lock up, won't you?

29:23.136 --> 29:25.680
- But... But...
- I'll take care of poor Rosemary.

29:25.681 --> 29:29.226
But I heard her voice. It's her!

29:38.402 --> 29:41.362
Mr. Sterner, you've
lost a tiny filling.

29:41.363 --> 29:44.490
I have to drill deeply enough
to remove all the decay.

29:44.491 --> 29:47.991
All right, go ahead, but be
careful. It really hurts.

29:49.413 --> 29:54.250
Open... Wider... Very wide.

30:06.013 --> 30:11.094
Mrs. Sterner, you can't go
back there. Mrs. Sterner...

30:11.476 --> 30:14.395
God damn you! You're trying
to hurt me on purpose.

30:14.396 --> 30:15.896
Are you okay, Ralph?

30:15.897 --> 30:18.316
Mrs. Sterner, please stay
in the waiting room.

30:18.317 --> 30:22.361
Help me, Betty, he's worse than
the dentist in The Marathon Man.

30:22.362 --> 30:23.904
I'm sorry to interrupt,
Doctor Sutphin,

30:23.905 --> 30:28.410
but there are two police detectives
waiting to see you in your office.

30:29.995 --> 30:31.447
Fine.

30:33.373 --> 30:35.750
Good morning. What is it, Officers?

30:35.751 --> 30:37.251
My patient is waiting.

30:37.252 --> 30:40.046
Doctor Sutphin, is your
wife a big reader?

30:40.047 --> 30:41.797
Bird books, mostly.

30:41.798 --> 30:43.549
Like these we found in her garbage.

30:43.550 --> 30:46.302
Urge to Kill, Mass
Murder in Houston?

30:46.303 --> 30:48.387
I'm sure those are
my son Chip's books.

30:48.388 --> 30:50.097
No, they're your wife's.

30:50.098 --> 30:51.390
We checked.

30:51.391 --> 30:54.935
She bought them at the

30:54.936 --> 30:56.437
along with a few other titles.

30:56.438 --> 30:59.106
Helter Skelter. Hunting Humans.

30:59.107 --> 31:04.236
MasterCard reference number
7876, dated February 5th.

31:04.237 --> 31:05.529
This is ridiculous!

31:05.947 --> 31:08.821
Doctor Sutphin, is
your wife mental?

31:12.204 --> 31:15.206
Damn these gnats. I hate them.

31:15.207 --> 31:18.331
Always something, isn't it?
Can I help you?

31:19.836 --> 31:21.629
Thanks for not buying anything.

31:21.630 --> 31:25.132
Misty, honey. Now lighten up.

31:25.133 --> 31:28.803
It's not the customer's fault
that Carl stood you up.

31:38.897 --> 31:41.982
Young man, this Fabergé
egg is chipped.

31:41.983 --> 31:43.275
Yes, ma'am, it is.

31:43.568 --> 31:45.319
I'll give you $50.

31:45.320 --> 31:48.447
That's a Franklin Mint piece. $100.

31:48.448 --> 31:53.028
$100? Franklin Mint or not,
that's damaged goods.

31:54.287 --> 31:58.583
Hello. This is a very special doll.

32:01.545 --> 32:05.795
This veil is from a gown that came from
a bride who was left at the altar.

32:05.841 --> 32:07.293
Only one of its kind.

32:11.721 --> 32:13.347
I'll take this instead.

32:13.348 --> 32:14.723
Oh, that's a nice one, huh?

32:14.724 --> 32:17.222
It'll be cold before you know it.

32:17.561 --> 32:21.561
$3? I guess that's how
I must have marked it.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.398
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

32:32.409 --> 32:34.994
Did you find your Franklin
Mint egg, Rosemary, darling?

32:34.995 --> 32:37.997
Well, I saw one, but it
was really overpriced.

32:37.998 --> 32:40.416
Oh, want me to keep this
under the table for you?

32:40.417 --> 32:43.086
If you don't mind. It was on sale.

32:47.215 --> 32:49.964
Oh, Franklin Mint.

32:57.726 --> 33:01.896
Honey, please, for
my bedroom shelf.

33:01.897 --> 33:05.067
Okay. Wrap it up for
the little lady.

33:06.735 --> 33:08.937
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

33:26.087 --> 33:27.421
I'm thirsty.

33:27.422 --> 33:28.919
What do you want?

33:40.018 --> 33:41.101
The Colts.

33:41.102 --> 33:44.146
Banner, please. Thank you.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.477
Honey, I have to take a piss.

35:29.502 --> 35:31.170
There you go.

35:31.171 --> 35:33.672
I can't believe it.
It's fucking Don Knotts.

35:33.673 --> 35:35.716
- He's the coolest. Thanks.
- Bye.

35:35.717 --> 35:39.387
Honey! Look! I made a killing.

35:52.233 --> 35:53.609
Mom, watch the booth.

35:53.610 --> 35:54.735
I want to see what's going on.

35:54.736 --> 35:56.279
Sure.

35:59.115 --> 36:01.241
I hope nothing's wrong.

36:01.242 --> 36:05.079
Beverly, honey, you've got
some doo-doo on your shoe.

36:11.127 --> 36:12.328
I hate that.

36:15.632 --> 36:17.800
There was a lady in the
men's room, I swear.

36:18.093 --> 36:20.421
A pretty little lady in the
stall right next to me.

36:37.612 --> 36:39.359
She must know him.

36:39.447 --> 36:40.648
Carl!

36:48.748 --> 36:50.916
- What happened?
- I don't know...

36:50.917 --> 36:52.664
That's $158.

36:54.254 --> 36:56.213
New York money good enough for you?

36:56.214 --> 36:57.666
Certainly.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.634
Thank you.

37:00.635 --> 37:04.385
Mother! Mother, it's Carl.

37:05.098 --> 37:06.807
He's dead.

37:06.808 --> 37:08.305
How horrible.

37:08.309 --> 37:10.644
Oh, I just sold
the Pee-Wee Herman doll.

37:10.645 --> 37:12.146
Mother, didn't you hear me?

37:12.147 --> 37:16.477
Someone murdered Carl in the men's
room. I just saw his dead body.

37:18.445 --> 37:20.647
You got your wish, dear.

37:21.156 --> 37:26.613
I didn't wish that.
I didn't want him dead.

38:22.550 --> 38:24.885
Beverly, it's me, Ted Bundy.

38:24.886 --> 38:27.554
It's late at night, six
days before my execution

38:27.555 --> 38:29.678
and it's lonely here on death row.

38:32.060 --> 38:33.811
Updating the story of the hour,

38:33.812 --> 38:36.480
the young man brutally murdered a
short time ago in the men's room

38:36.481 --> 38:38.023
of the Antique Traders Mart

38:38.024 --> 38:42.354
has been identified as 22-year-old
Carl Pageant of Towson.

39:06.094 --> 39:08.046
No, no, no! No!

39:08.096 --> 39:11.721
Chip! Our mother is Charles Manson.

39:13.518 --> 39:15.435
I'm not kidding.

39:15.436 --> 39:18.438
Carl stood me up this morning and then
he was murdered at the flea market.

39:18.439 --> 39:20.516
- Murdered?
- Yes, murdered!

39:20.525 --> 39:23.527
You said you hated your teacher
yesterday and he was murdered, too.

39:23.528 --> 39:25.863
Look, I don't know.
Maybe Mom's nuts.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.656
That's a cool idea, Misty.

39:27.657 --> 39:30.784
Hey, let's make a gore movie about
Mom, better yet, a TV series.

39:31.911 --> 39:33.078
Hey, can I borrow your mother?

39:33.079 --> 39:34.413
My aunt's coming over for dinner

39:34.414 --> 39:36.623
and she's always
getting on my nerves.

39:36.624 --> 39:37.833
My stepfather's an asshole.

39:37.834 --> 39:39.585
- She could kill him.
- How about Mrs. Ackerman?

39:39.586 --> 39:42.504
We all hate her. Who's
gonna be the next victim?

39:42.505 --> 39:45.709
No, stop it! It's not funny.

39:47.176 --> 39:51.301
Mom might do it.
Somebody else might die.

39:55.518 --> 39:57.470
Dinner is served.

39:58.813 --> 40:01.732
Let's say grace and
pray for the strength

40:01.733 --> 40:05.277
to understand the terrible
tragedies of the last few days.

40:05.278 --> 40:07.529
Amen to that.

40:07.530 --> 40:10.153
It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?

40:13.494 --> 40:16.994
Bless, O Lord, this food to our
use and our self to Thy service.

40:17.582 --> 40:19.409
- Amen.
- Amen.

40:20.960 --> 40:22.836
- Amen.
- Amen.

40:22.837 --> 40:24.338
Hungry, honey?

40:24.339 --> 40:27.674
Dottie Hinkle was right.
It is Beverly Sutphin.

40:27.675 --> 40:31.505
I tell you, I saw blood right
there on the bottom of her shoes.

40:31.638 --> 40:36.890
Not exactly blood... it was gore,
hanging there like a runny nose.

40:39.729 --> 40:42.272
Nice as pie, she was to me.
And then I hear her say it.

40:42.273 --> 40:44.146
Say what, ma'am?

40:45.109 --> 40:48.862
"Are those..." I can't
say the word out loud.

40:48.863 --> 40:51.531
Could you tell a policewoman
the exact words she used?

40:51.532 --> 40:53.029
Maybe.

40:56.162 --> 40:58.455
It's okay. Nobody's gonna hurt you.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.540
Come on. Let it out.

41:00.541 --> 41:04.166
"Pussy," that's what she
said to me. "Pussy willows."

41:10.677 --> 41:12.886
- You know, Mom...
- Mmm?

41:12.887 --> 41:15.431
Scotty thinks you're the killer.

41:17.558 --> 41:19.055
Does he?

41:19.310 --> 41:24.189
You know, for somebody who doesn't wear
his seatbelt, Scotty sure is nosy.

41:25.066 --> 41:27.234
Oh, just a second.

42:05.481 --> 42:06.728
She's gone!

42:10.236 --> 42:11.737
She's gonna kill Scotty!

42:11.738 --> 42:13.238
Get in the car, both of you.

42:13.239 --> 42:14.906
Dad, you don't think
she did it, do you?

42:14.907 --> 42:17.284
I do. Mom's gone crazy.

42:17.285 --> 42:19.953
Your mother may have some
problems. That's all, Chip.

42:19.954 --> 42:21.827
Come on, hurry.

42:43.227 --> 42:44.811
Detective Gracey and all units.

42:44.812 --> 42:47.356
Suspect's family headed
east on Calverton.

42:47.398 --> 42:49.649
Repeat, east on Calverton.

42:49.650 --> 42:51.234
Turn right on Timonium Road, Dad.

42:51.235 --> 42:53.187
- I will, I will.
- Hurry.

43:03.706 --> 43:07.542
<i>Daybreak if you'll only believe</i>

43:07.543 --> 43:12.047
<i>It can be daybreak
Ain't no time to grieve</i>

43:12.048 --> 43:15.467
<i>'Cause it's daybreak
If you'll only believe</i>

43:15.468 --> 43:19.047
<i>And let it shine, shine, shine...</i>

43:33.694 --> 43:37.273
If Mom is psycho, Scotty will
still be okay, won't he?

43:38.366 --> 43:40.575
We hope so, Son.

43:40.576 --> 43:43.780
And no matter what your mother
is, we'll love her anyway.

44:52.106 --> 44:56.186
This is Scotty's, Dad. His
parents aren't home. Come on.

44:57.612 --> 44:59.530
Scotty?

45:19.300 --> 45:21.801
What was that?

45:21.802 --> 45:23.345
I didn't hear anything.

45:23.971 --> 45:25.180
Got any dessert?

45:25.181 --> 45:28.642
Doctor Sutphin said
no sweets for you.

45:28.643 --> 45:30.477
Yeah, well, what's he know?

45:30.478 --> 45:32.476
How to send a bill!

45:38.819 --> 45:40.692
I'll get the door.

45:42.281 --> 45:43.949
Suspect's family entering house.

45:43.950 --> 45:46.368
Send backup to 400 Sycamore Street.

45:46.369 --> 45:48.287
I have a feeling old Mom's inside.

45:54.669 --> 45:59.340
Wheel of Fortune!

46:01.217 --> 46:03.635
Ralph, Wheel of Fortune's on!

46:03.636 --> 46:05.053
I'm still eating!

46:06.389 --> 46:09.263
The world's most
popular game show...

46:39.213 --> 46:43.008
Come on up, honey, before
the kids get home.

46:44.218 --> 46:45.802
May I have a "P"?

46:45.803 --> 46:47.755
Mmm-hmm. A couple of "P's."

46:53.185 --> 46:54.269
Ralph!

46:54.270 --> 46:55.854
What is it, Betty?

46:55.855 --> 46:57.773
I think we've got
mice or something.

46:58.065 --> 47:00.188
No, no, no. We paid
the exterminator.

47:14.498 --> 47:15.699
Betty?

47:25.426 --> 47:27.128
It's upstairs.

47:29.347 --> 47:31.299
I'm going in. Over.

47:35.644 --> 47:37.395
It's the door on the left.

47:42.902 --> 47:45.605
Break it down, Dad. Break it down!

47:47.698 --> 47:49.240
Scotty, man...

47:49.241 --> 47:50.818
Police! Freeze!

47:54.955 --> 47:57.829
Betty? Betty, answer me!

48:01.170 --> 48:02.872
Ralph...

48:16.560 --> 48:22.267
Help! Help me! Help me,
please! Please!

48:25.027 --> 48:26.479
Help me, somebody!

48:36.747 --> 48:39.791
Home, sweet home!
Everything's fine, kids.

48:40.167 --> 48:42.794
I can't believe I thought my
own mother was a murderess.

48:42.795 --> 48:44.921
I'm kind of disappointed she isn't.

48:44.922 --> 48:46.965
For a while there it was
like being in the movies.

48:46.966 --> 48:50.466
Anybody for dessert?
Mmm. Strawberries.

49:08.863 --> 49:10.360
Let's go.

49:42.021 --> 49:44.981
Dad, you said it would be okay.
Make them go away.

49:44.982 --> 49:46.232
This is embarrassing.

49:46.233 --> 49:47.984
Just pay no attention
to the police.

49:47.985 --> 49:49.694
It's all a terrible mistake.

49:49.695 --> 49:52.819
Do you think we'll get
on A Current Affair?

49:58.329 --> 50:02.332
Sutphin family proceeding west
on Seminary Avenue. Over.

50:02.333 --> 50:04.956
Beverly ain't going
nowhere this time.

50:16.931 --> 50:18.806
She's headed for church.

50:18.807 --> 50:20.308
I say we nail her. Over.

50:20.309 --> 50:21.392
Negative.

50:21.393 --> 50:25.104
DA says no bust until lab report is
back matching suspect's fingerprints

50:25.105 --> 50:29.105
on true crime book with those
on scissors and fire poker.

50:29.443 --> 50:31.861
The senseless killing last
night of a Towson couple,

50:31.862 --> 50:35.281
Ralph and Betty Sterner, brings
to a total of four murders

50:35.282 --> 50:39.827
police feel may have been committed
by Baltimore's first serial killer.

50:39.828 --> 50:41.037
Information is still
sketchy at this point...

50:41.038 --> 50:42.205
Beverly...

50:42.206 --> 50:43.414
Not the Sterners!

50:43.415 --> 50:46.584
Oh, it's a shame, but they should have
brushed their teeth, shouldn't they?

50:47.628 --> 50:48.753
This just in.

50:48.754 --> 50:50.088
Police lieutenant Ronald Habbler

50:50.089 --> 50:54.300
has publicly named a suspect in the
serial killer case, and it's a shocker!

50:54.301 --> 50:57.178
She, that's right, she
has been identified

50:57.179 --> 50:59.013
as Beverly R. Sutphin of
2815 Calverton Court...

50:59.014 --> 51:01.967
Oh, really...

51:03.686 --> 51:07.480
God. Now I'll never
get a boyfriend.

51:07.481 --> 51:11.943
Beverly, I've read all
about this. Is it menopause?

51:11.944 --> 51:13.319
Oh, honey...

51:13.320 --> 51:16.489
Tell me the truth, Mom.
Really, it's okay with me.

51:16.490 --> 51:18.491
Are you a serial killer?

51:18.492 --> 51:22.868
Chip, the only cereal I know
anything about is Rice Krispies.

51:31.839 --> 51:35.919
Don't worry, honey, we're gonna
get you good psychiatric help.

51:59.575 --> 52:02.035
Well, look at that.

52:02.036 --> 52:04.409
And in the house of God.

52:07.416 --> 52:09.618
Who does she think she is?

52:11.253 --> 52:12.462
Gus, Sloppy. Hi.

52:12.463 --> 52:13.789
Hi.

52:14.173 --> 52:15.298
Chip!

52:15.299 --> 52:16.382
Hey, what's up, Birdie?
Can you come...

52:16.383 --> 52:18.176
We said no, remember?

52:18.177 --> 52:20.846
Birdie, please, you can't
talk to him. Now, please...

52:21.555 --> 52:22.972
Stay with us, honey.

52:23.641 --> 52:27.095
She's awful! She can't stay here.

52:27.102 --> 52:28.975
Good morning, ladies.

52:31.857 --> 52:34.067
So tell me, Mrs. Sutphin,
are you Serial Mom?

52:34.068 --> 52:36.020
- What?
- No comment.

52:36.362 --> 52:40.406
Serial Mom! Wow!

52:40.407 --> 52:42.484
She's headed in, over.

53:20.155 --> 53:21.902
Please stand.

53:25.744 --> 53:29.872
Blessed be God, Father,
Son and Holy Spirit.

53:29.873 --> 53:33.710
And blessed be His
kingdom, now and forever.

53:33.711 --> 53:34.961
Amen.

53:34.962 --> 53:37.630
Hallelujah! Christ has risen.

53:37.631 --> 53:39.966
The Lord is risen indeed.

53:39.967 --> 53:41.134
Hallelujah.

53:41.135 --> 53:44.555
Bless the Lord, who
forgiveth all our sins...

53:44.930 --> 53:46.764
This is Captain Luecker
from Homicide.

53:46.765 --> 53:49.600
Lab reports confirm Sutphin
latent print of index finger

53:49.601 --> 53:50.727
on true-crime book

53:50.728 --> 53:53.646
matches those latent prints
lifted from murder weapons.

53:53.647 --> 53:56.482
Bingo, boys! Bust the bitch!

53:56.483 --> 53:57.730
Copy.

54:02.948 --> 54:06.659
Jesus said nothing to
condemn capital punishment

54:06.660 --> 54:09.363
as he hung on the cross, did he?

54:09.496 --> 54:10.663
No...

54:10.664 --> 54:16.002
If ever there was a time to go on
record against the death penalty,

54:16.003 --> 54:17.920
wasn't it that night?

54:19.298 --> 54:24.049
Capital punishment is already the
law in the state of Maryland.

54:24.595 --> 54:30.518
So what are we waiting for, fellow
Christians? Let's just do it.

54:30.726 --> 54:32.644
Amen!

54:34.688 --> 54:35.730
How you doing?

54:35.731 --> 54:37.057
All standing.

54:39.359 --> 54:44.238
Let us pray and humbly confess
our sins unto Almighty God.

54:44.239 --> 54:49.076
Most merciful God, we confess
that we have sinned against Thee,

54:49.077 --> 54:56.042
by what we have done and by what we
have left undone. We are truly sorry

54:56.043 --> 55:01.380
and we humbly repent so that
we may delight in Thy will

55:01.381 --> 55:06.177
and walk in Thy ways to
the glory of Thy name.

55:06.178 --> 55:08.221
Amen.

55:20.484 --> 55:24.359
Beverly? Beverly!

55:29.159 --> 55:32.408
Misty? Beverly?

55:32.788 --> 55:33.913
There she is!

55:33.914 --> 55:38.210
Beverly! Misty! Misty...

55:38.544 --> 55:39.791
Misty! Come on...

55:41.630 --> 55:43.840
You guys, come on!
Come on, come on, come on!

55:43.841 --> 55:47.090
Please, Mrs. Sutphin.
Hurry... Get in...

55:50.430 --> 55:53.133
We'll show them, Mom!
We'll go on 60 Minutes!

55:54.017 --> 55:56.936
You know, you're bigger
than Freddy and Jason now,

55:56.937 --> 55:58.604
only you're a real person!

55:58.605 --> 56:00.022
Do you think I need a lawyer?

56:00.023 --> 56:01.524
You need an agent.

56:01.525 --> 56:03.022
An agent?

56:15.038 --> 56:17.036
Hey! Hey!

56:17.583 --> 56:19.542
- Is your wife a murderess?
- No comment!

56:19.543 --> 56:22.587
Please, my wife is missing.
I'm worried sick about her!

56:22.588 --> 56:24.165
Hey... Hey. Misty.

56:24.214 --> 56:27.925
Just a couple of shots, okay? I'm
Howell Hawkins from the Baltimore Sun.

56:27.926 --> 56:29.468
Hi, Howell.

56:29.469 --> 56:31.842
Misty Sutphin, get in this car!

56:50.908 --> 56:54.243
We're tailing Sutphin husband and daughter
but Serial Mom is nowhere in sight.

56:54.244 --> 56:57.493
She got away, boys!
God damn it! Find her!

56:58.665 --> 57:00.166
- In here, Mom.
- But, Chip...

57:00.167 --> 57:01.876
Come on, Mom, I have to open...

57:01.877 --> 57:03.628
Oh, now, this is so silly.

57:03.629 --> 57:05.212
Bye, Mom.

57:05.213 --> 57:08.041
Customers! Get the door.

57:10.802 --> 57:12.511
Good morning, Mrs. Jenson.

57:12.512 --> 57:13.884
Good morning.

57:23.523 --> 57:26.727
Haven't you had enough
violence, Chip Sutphin?

57:26.818 --> 57:28.945
Turn that filth off.

57:28.946 --> 57:30.363
Sorry, ma'am.

57:30.697 --> 57:33.115
Do you have the musical, Annie?

57:33.116 --> 57:37.162
Sure do. Did you bring
back Ghost Dad?

57:37.871 --> 57:39.413
There you go.

57:39.414 --> 57:42.333
I just love Bill Cosby pictures.

57:42.334 --> 57:44.210
Miss Jenson, I've told you,

57:44.211 --> 57:47.171
you have to rewind the tapes
before returning them.

57:47.172 --> 57:48.214
Why?

57:48.215 --> 57:49.882
Because it's the rules.

57:49.883 --> 57:52.586
I don't feel like rewinding them.

57:53.220 --> 57:56.389
You see that sign? It's a
dollar fine for not rewinding

57:56.390 --> 58:02.768
and this time I'm gonna charge you.
$2.99 plus $1 is $3.99.

58:03.605 --> 58:06.433
Keep the change, you
son of a psycho!

58:07.359 --> 58:09.068
What a bitch!

58:09.069 --> 58:13.149
It's the influence of all those
family films. Right, Mom?

58:14.741 --> 58:16.943
- Hey, Mom!
- Mrs. Sutphin?

58:18.203 --> 58:21.031
Mother? Mother?

58:22.416 --> 58:23.959
Oh, shit!

58:24.001 --> 58:25.418
- You don't think she would...
- She wouldn't...

58:25.419 --> 58:27.792
What's Miss Jenson's address?

58:27.921 --> 58:31.007
Jenkins... Jenson. Emma Lou
Jenson, 19 Clark Avenue.

58:31.008 --> 58:32.258
That's right up the street.

58:32.259 --> 58:34.382
Come on, just in case.

58:35.095 --> 58:37.389
Come on, Birdie, let's go!

59:23.727 --> 59:30.230
What is it, Sylvester? A birdie?
Shh. Mommy's watching Annie.

59:31.818 --> 59:35.154
<i>The sun'll come out
Tomorrow</i>

59:35.155 --> 59:37.948
<i>Bet your bottom
dollar that tomorrow</i>

59:38.992 --> 59:42.036
Quiet, Sylvester! Nobody's there.

59:43.872 --> 59:45.873
Come on, lick Mommy's feet.

59:45.874 --> 59:48.042
Get them all wet.

59:48.585 --> 59:52.665
<i>And the sorrow
Till there's none</i>

59:53.965 --> 59:56.293
Come on, Birdie. Come on.

59:59.638 --> 01:00:00.679
Number 19.

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.553
That's it. Come on.

01:00:08.355 --> 01:00:12.024
Over here! Chip, over here!

01:00:12.025 --> 01:00:13.442
<i>Tomorrow</i>

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:17.398
<i>So you gotta hang on
Till tomorrow</i>

01:00:17.572 --> 01:00:18.781
Come what may

01:00:18.782 --> 01:00:20.991
Come on...

01:00:20.992 --> 01:00:24.495
<i>Just thinking about
Tomorrow</i>

01:00:24.496 --> 01:00:29.208
<i>Clears away the cobwebs
And the sorrow</i>

01:00:29.209 --> 01:00:32.253
<i>Till there's none!</i>

01:00:32.504 --> 01:00:34.588
<i>When I'm stuck with a day</i>

01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:37.713
<i>That's gray
And lonely</i>

01:00:37.717 --> 01:00:41.554
<i>I just stick out my chin
And grin and say</i>

01:00:41.555 --> 01:00:44.223
Get up there, get up there.
Is she in there?

01:00:44.224 --> 01:00:47.560
<i>Oh!</i>

01:00:47.561 --> 01:00:51.230
<i>The sun'll come out
Tomorrow</i>

01:00:51.231 --> 01:00:55.860
<i>So you gotta hang on
Till tomorrow</i>

01:00:55.861 --> 01:00:58.946
<i>Come what may</i>

01:00:58.947 --> 01:01:02.074
<i>Tomorrow!
Tomorrow!</i>

01:01:02.075 --> 01:01:05.279
<i>I love you, tomorrow!</i>

01:01:06.121 --> 01:01:08.119
She's singing Annie.

01:01:10.917 --> 01:01:14.545
<i>The sun'll come out
Tomorrow</i>

01:01:14.546 --> 01:01:19.300
<i>So you gotta hang on
Till tomorrow</i>

01:01:19.301 --> 01:01:22.344
<i>Come what may</i>

01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:25.431
<i>Tomorrow!
Tomorrow!</i>

01:01:25.432 --> 01:01:28.434
<i>I love you, tomorrow!</i>

01:01:28.435 --> 01:01:33.357
<i>You're only a day away</i>

01:01:53.877 --> 01:01:55.875
Rewind!

01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:32.331
Oh, my God! No!

01:02:35.669 --> 01:02:37.962
I saw blood, and it's brown!

01:02:37.963 --> 01:02:40.422
It's not red like in the
horror movies, but brown!

01:02:40.423 --> 01:02:42.007
- Is Mom in there?
- No!

01:02:42.008 --> 01:02:47.135
It wasn't like the gore
movies at all! It was real.

01:02:58.984 --> 01:03:01.357
Come on! Birdie, let's
cut through here!

01:03:12.205 --> 01:03:17.252
Wear your seatbelt! It's the law!

01:03:28.013 --> 01:03:29.888
- Out, please.
- What the fuck?

01:03:29.889 --> 01:03:31.807
Yes, ma'am.

01:03:46.323 --> 01:03:49.742
Dear God, I promise I'll never
watch another sex film again!

01:03:49.743 --> 01:03:51.991
I promise! I promise!

01:04:21.649 --> 01:04:23.192
It's okay.

01:04:26.613 --> 01:04:29.987
Dad! Dad...

01:04:31.076 --> 01:04:32.117
Have you seen Mom?

01:04:32.118 --> 01:04:33.911
No, have you?

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:37.123
Scotty?

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:43.080
Oh, my God!

01:04:44.464 --> 01:04:45.836
Get in!

01:05:02.065 --> 01:05:04.358
All units, Serial Mom is
headed south on Keswick.

01:05:04.359 --> 01:05:07.820
Proceed with caution. She
is armed and fucking nuts!

01:05:25.672 --> 01:05:27.374
Oh, shit!

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:55.409
Mike! Mike! Let me in, okay?

01:05:55.410 --> 01:05:56.785
Hey! ID.

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:57.870
Can I give it to you inside?

01:05:57.871 --> 01:06:00.574
Hey, buddy, nobody
gets in without ID.

01:06:02.083 --> 01:06:03.167
Birth date?

01:06:03.168 --> 01:06:05.336
December 14, 1972.

01:06:06.713 --> 01:06:08.255
Please!

01:06:08.256 --> 01:06:10.003
Okay, go ahead.

01:06:16.598 --> 01:06:19.725
<i>I won't flinch and I
won't break a sweat</i>

01:06:19.726 --> 01:06:23.020
<i>When I taste the cyanide gas</i>

01:06:23.021 --> 01:06:25.474
<i>Gas, gas</i>

01:06:26.441 --> 01:06:29.193
<i>Only way you're gonna shut me up</i>

01:06:29.194 --> 01:06:33.989
<i>Only way you're gonna shut me up</i>

01:06:39.537 --> 01:06:40.996
- Hey!
- Excuse me.

01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:42.915
- Excuse me.
- Hey, look, it's her.

01:06:42.916 --> 01:06:44.249
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Who?

01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:46.084
It's the murder lady,
the one on TV.

01:06:46.085 --> 01:06:48.295
- Excuse me.
- Cool. Is she in a band?

01:06:48.296 --> 01:06:51.465
<i>Watch me wither through the glass</i>

01:06:51.466 --> 01:06:54.385
<i>Smiling as I sip the last gas</i>

01:06:54.928 --> 01:06:57.763
<i>Justifiable homicide</i>

01:06:57.764 --> 01:07:00.933
<i>Almond blossom-scented cyanide</i>

01:07:00.934 --> 01:07:04.895
<i>Gas chamber</i>

01:07:04.896 --> 01:07:06.605
The police are after me.
I beg your pardon.

01:07:06.606 --> 01:07:08.565
Hey, hey, hey. hey!

01:07:08.566 --> 01:07:11.985
Hey... You're Serial Mom.

01:07:11.986 --> 01:07:13.312
Yes, I guess I am.

01:07:13.738 --> 01:07:15.030
Well, come on in, lady. Quick!

01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:20.408
<i>You'll keep me down
Only way you think you'll keep me down</i>

01:07:24.457 --> 01:07:26.708
Coming through. Thank you.

01:07:33.508 --> 01:07:35.085
Help. Help!

01:07:36.302 --> 01:07:38.220
Excuse me, please.

01:07:47.855 --> 01:07:50.065
I think maybe you
better lock the car.

01:07:50.066 --> 01:07:52.150
- Can't stop now.
- Is my mom in there?

01:07:52.151 --> 01:07:54.024
Dad, now, look cool.
It's Hammerjacks.

01:07:58.324 --> 01:07:59.992
Excuse me.

01:08:03.496 --> 01:08:06.165
Kids! Put me down! Put me down!

01:08:08.251 --> 01:08:11.503
<i>Your God says thou shalt not kill</i>

01:08:11.504 --> 01:08:13.877
<i>But here you are dropping the pill</i>

01:08:14.799 --> 01:08:16.841
<i>Legal system, what a sham</i>

01:08:16.843 --> 01:08:17.968
Put me down!

01:08:17.969 --> 01:08:21.969
<i>Flying colors on the final exam</i>

01:08:22.223 --> 01:08:24.300
<i>Gas chamber</i>

01:08:30.857 --> 01:08:34.276
<i>Gas chamber</i>

01:08:34.277 --> 01:08:37.279
<i>Only way you're gonna shut me up</i>

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:40.359
<i>Only way you're gonna shut me up</i>

01:08:40.408 --> 01:08:42.359
Buckle up, Scotty!

01:08:45.246 --> 01:08:49.576
Oh! Mrs. Sutphin! No! I'll wear
my seatbelt, Mrs. Sutphin.

01:08:55.214 --> 01:08:57.542
Holy fucking shit!

01:09:22.992 --> 01:09:24.193
Hi!

01:09:34.295 --> 01:09:36.792
Move it! You're under arrest!

01:09:41.426 --> 01:09:43.345
- Honey?
- Shut up.

01:10:04.117 --> 01:10:07.035
Serial Mom! Serial Mom!

01:10:07.036 --> 01:10:11.748
Serial Mom! Serial Mom! Serial
Mom! Serial Mom! Serial Mom!

01:10:11.749 --> 01:10:17.831
Serial Mom! Serial Mom! Serial Mom!
Serial Mom! Serial Mom! Serial Mom!

01:10:21.968 --> 01:10:24.136
- Can she get a fair jury?
- Misty! Look this way!

01:10:24.137 --> 01:10:25.262
Please just let us through.

01:10:25.263 --> 01:10:26.805
- your wife's innocence, Mr. Sutphin?
- Please!

01:10:26.806 --> 01:10:29.099
How does it feel to
have a killer mom?

01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:31.977
Mr. Sutphin, how
does your wife feel?

01:10:31.978 --> 01:10:34.730
Beverly is devastated by
the charges against her.

01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:37.190
<i>Just now I found a peanut</i>

01:10:37.191 --> 01:10:39.317
<i>Found a peanut, right now</i>

01:10:39.318 --> 01:10:41.653
<i>Cracked it open, cracked it open</i>

01:10:41.654 --> 01:10:43.864
<i>Cracked it open just now...</i>

01:10:43.865 --> 01:10:44.990
Didn't I see you at Hinckley?

01:10:44.991 --> 01:10:47.159
- I was there.
- I thought so.

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:48.660
My husband thought I was crazy.

01:10:48.661 --> 01:10:49.745
She is.

01:10:49.746 --> 01:10:52.664
Today we're covering day one
of the trial of Serial Mom...

01:10:52.665 --> 01:10:54.538
Look! Here they come!

01:10:56.711 --> 01:10:59.334
Stop the violence? What is this?
Who are you working for?

01:11:01.174 --> 01:11:02.674
What do you think her chances are?

01:11:02.675 --> 01:11:05.048
Excuse me! Mr. Sutphin!
Coming through.

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:10.675
Quiet in the courtroom.
This court is now in session.

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:16.521
Oh, hello, jury people.
I'm Beverly Sutphin.

01:11:16.522 --> 01:11:17.856
Oh, I like your jacket.

01:11:17.857 --> 01:11:20.230
Mrs. Sutphin, I said quiet.

01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:24.863
Honey, hi! Oh, kids, are
you doing your homework?

01:11:24.864 --> 01:11:27.442
You are accused of
multiple murders.

01:11:27.825 --> 01:11:30.535
This is a court of law,
not a coffee klatch.

01:11:30.536 --> 01:11:32.909
Mr. Nazlerod, your
opening statement.

01:11:33.498 --> 01:11:35.575
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:11:37.752 --> 01:11:39.377
Good morning, ladies and
gentlemen of the jury.

01:11:39.378 --> 01:11:43.173
My name is Timothy Nazlerod
and I hope we can be friends.

01:11:44.926 --> 01:11:46.426
I have to tell you at the outset,

01:11:46.427 --> 01:11:49.513
however, that this is
not a pretty case.

01:11:49.514 --> 01:11:55.060
This defendant, Beverly Sutphin,
is a woman evil to the core,

01:11:55.061 --> 01:11:57.103
a rotten apple, if you will,

01:11:57.104 --> 01:12:02.731
who beyond any reasonable doubt
killed six innocent people.

01:12:03.694 --> 01:12:05.904
That's right, she murdered them.

01:12:05.905 --> 01:12:07.906
- Well, they sort of deserved it.
- Shh.

01:12:07.907 --> 01:12:11.031
Evilly and with full premeditation,

01:12:11.786 --> 01:12:14.579
with a speeding car, a fire poker,

01:12:15.748 --> 01:12:19.703
a pair of scissors, a
toppled air conditioner,

01:12:20.086 --> 01:12:23.005
the lethal flames
from an aerosol can

01:12:24.215 --> 01:12:27.467
and yes, even a leg of lamb.

01:12:30.346 --> 01:12:34.471
Ladies and gentlemen of
the jury, this defendant,

01:12:35.142 --> 01:12:38.603
this Beverly Sutphin,
she is not a woman.

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:42.813
She is a monster!

01:12:45.444 --> 01:12:48.280
Defense attorney, your opening
statement for the jury?

01:12:48.281 --> 01:12:50.574
And let's not take all day, either.

01:12:54.453 --> 01:12:57.664
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Herbie Hebden

01:12:57.665 --> 01:13:01.001
and you and I have a
tough job ahead of us.

01:13:01.002 --> 01:13:04.379
I've known the Sutphin
family for 16 years.

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:07.340
Dad, Eugene, is my dentist.

01:13:07.341 --> 01:13:10.677
Chip and Misty played
with my own children.

01:13:10.678 --> 01:13:14.849
But I found out that I don't
know Beverly Sutphin at all.

01:13:15.349 --> 01:13:16.474
Psst.

01:13:16.475 --> 01:13:19.644
No one really knows Beverly
Sutphin. You see...

01:13:19.645 --> 01:13:20.846
Psst.

01:13:30.823 --> 01:13:32.782
Beverly Sutphin is insane.

01:13:33.951 --> 01:13:35.827
Yes, she committed
these terrible crimes,

01:13:35.828 --> 01:13:38.204
but that doesn't make
her a bad person.

01:13:38.205 --> 01:13:41.499
Your Honor, I would
like to make a motion.

01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:44.127
I wish to fire my attorney
and defend myself.

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:48.381
Beverly Sutphin is not guilty
by reason of insanity.

01:13:48.382 --> 01:13:51.968
Your Honor, I have the right to defend
myself. I've read the law books.

01:13:51.969 --> 01:13:57.721
Ware v. State, 1964 and
Schuette v. State, 1962.

01:13:58.392 --> 01:14:03.564
Mrs. Sutphin, the defendant who has herself
for a lawyer has a fool for a client.

01:14:04.023 --> 01:14:06.476
Counsel, approach the bench.

01:14:09.195 --> 01:14:10.654
I don't think this is a good idea.

01:14:10.655 --> 01:14:13.198
Oh, yeah. Oh, no. It's okay.

01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:16.284
That's my ruling.
Thank you very much.

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:19.162
Mrs. Sutphin, I have
no legal choice

01:14:19.163 --> 01:14:21.536
but to let you take over
as your own attorney.

01:14:23.376 --> 01:14:25.294
How do you plead?

01:14:27.838 --> 01:14:29.214
Not guilty, Your Honor.

01:14:30.925 --> 01:14:32.759
Order! Order in the courtroom.

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:36.590
Quiet down or I'll
clear this room out!

01:14:36.806 --> 01:14:40.601
I call to the stand Dottie Hinkle.

01:14:55.032 --> 01:14:56.408
Raise your right hand, please.

01:14:56.409 --> 01:14:59.411
Do you hereby solemnly swear or
affirm under the penalties of perjury

01:14:59.412 --> 01:15:01.371
that the testimony you are about
to give will be the truth,

01:15:01.372 --> 01:15:03.081
- the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
- I do.

01:15:03.082 --> 01:15:04.659
Thank you.

01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:10.755
Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive
any obscene telephone calls?

01:15:10.756 --> 01:15:12.090
I certainly did.

01:15:12.091 --> 01:15:14.794
And did you recognize the
voice of the caller?

01:15:14.885 --> 01:15:16.177
Not at first.

01:15:16.178 --> 01:15:17.721
But then I heard the
same inflection

01:15:17.722 --> 01:15:19.764
in a voice at a social gathering.

01:15:19.765 --> 01:15:22.138
And I put two and two together.

01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:25.137
Whose voice was it, Dottie?

01:15:25.604 --> 01:15:30.567
It was her, Beverly Sutphin,
sitting right there.

01:15:30.568 --> 01:15:32.816
I'm lucky I'm not dead.

01:15:38.492 --> 01:15:40.285
Mrs. Hinkle, do you drink?

01:15:40.286 --> 01:15:42.204
No, I don't.

01:15:42.288 --> 01:15:43.621
So you were not drunk

01:15:43.622 --> 01:15:47.668
when you received those
allegedly obscene phone calls?

01:15:47.752 --> 01:15:49.252
I certainly was not.

01:15:49.253 --> 01:15:53.089
Now, you mean to tell me that the
day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's,

01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:57.886
the day you claim you recognized
my voice, you were not drinking?

01:15:57.887 --> 01:16:00.590
One beer with lunch
is hardly drinking.

01:16:02.516 --> 01:16:04.726
So you do drink?

01:16:04.727 --> 01:16:07.146
Socially. I'll have a beer.

01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:09.355
So you admit you just lied.

01:16:09.356 --> 01:16:10.940
No, I don't, you bitch!

01:16:11.984 --> 01:16:13.481
Watch your mouth, Mrs. Hinkle.

01:16:16.822 --> 01:16:19.365
Did you see that? She just
said, "Fuck you" to me!

01:16:20.451 --> 01:16:23.450
Let the record show I am
merely standing here.

01:16:23.454 --> 01:16:25.497
Fuck you, too, you whore.

01:16:25.498 --> 01:16:27.207
I'm warning you, Mrs. Hinkle.

01:16:27.208 --> 01:16:31.709
One more obscenity and I'm gonna
charge you with contempt of court.

01:16:32.797 --> 01:16:35.757
Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?

01:16:35.758 --> 01:16:37.801
No, I'm not, you motherfucker!

01:16:39.095 --> 01:16:41.179
Mrs. Hinkle, I find you
guilty of contempt

01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:45.226
and I sentence you to a $1,000
fine and five days in jail!

01:16:45.434 --> 01:16:47.018
- Cocksucker!
- Lock her up!

01:16:47.019 --> 01:16:50.271
You lousy pig fucker! You bitch!

01:16:50.272 --> 01:16:52.023
You ugly whore! Let go!

01:16:56.862 --> 01:16:58.238
Come on, they're going quickly!

01:16:58.239 --> 01:16:59.614
"Serial Mom" t-shirts.
Get them here.

01:16:59.615 --> 01:17:01.866
$12, while they last, plus tax.

01:17:01.867 --> 01:17:03.576
- MasterCard and Visa.
- I'll take two.

01:17:03.577 --> 01:17:04.744
All right, ma'am.

01:17:04.745 --> 01:17:07.664
I wish they'd had something like
this at the Kennedy kid trial.

01:17:08.499 --> 01:17:11.501
Sign right here. Signature
and home phone.

01:17:11.502 --> 01:17:12.919
You've read about it in the paper!

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:16.381
Serial Mom. She's Beverly
Sutphin and she's my mom!

01:17:16.382 --> 01:17:19.759
Listen, you tell Geraldo
to go to hell, okay?

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:23.346
I don't care what Jeffrey MacDonald's
people got. He's old news.

01:17:23.347 --> 01:17:26.891
We fly first class or we don't
do the show. It's that simple.

01:17:26.892 --> 01:17:28.184
Are you Chip Sutphin?

01:17:28.185 --> 01:17:29.807
Hold on a sec.

01:17:30.688 --> 01:17:33.857
Yeah, I am, but you're gonna
have to speak with my agent.

01:17:33.858 --> 01:17:37.358
Your mom killed my
brother. Come on!

01:17:38.237 --> 01:17:39.320
Come on...

01:17:39.321 --> 01:17:41.694
God... Jeez, man!

01:17:42.741 --> 01:17:45.410
It's cool. It's cool, all right?

01:17:46.745 --> 01:17:47.912
You're Carl's brother, right?

01:17:47.913 --> 01:17:49.205
That's right.

01:17:49.582 --> 01:17:51.409
I'm sorry he's dead.

01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:54.544
But have you signed off yet?

01:17:54.545 --> 01:17:56.122
You mean for TV or print?

01:17:56.172 --> 01:18:00.216
TV, man. Suzanne Somers is
interested in playing my mom.

01:18:00.217 --> 01:18:01.794
Suzanne Somers?

01:18:02.386 --> 01:18:04.596
Who's gonna play my brother?

01:18:04.597 --> 01:18:06.925
I wonder if Jason
Priestley's available?

01:18:07.975 --> 01:18:11.475
Miss Hodges, could you
describe the car?

01:18:13.063 --> 01:18:17.108
The one you saw run over
Mr. Stubbins in cold blood.

01:18:17.109 --> 01:18:19.732
I seen that movie. It was on cable.

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:24.657
Miss Hodges... Please, Miss Hodges.

01:18:24.658 --> 01:18:27.785
Could you... Could you describe...

01:18:28.913 --> 01:18:30.955
Miss Hodges.

01:18:30.956 --> 01:18:32.499
Excuse me.

01:18:33.751 --> 01:18:36.670
Look, man, like I told
you, it was blue.

01:18:37.713 --> 01:18:40.840
The car, not the driver.

01:18:44.094 --> 01:18:46.513
Look, it was just blue.

01:18:47.556 --> 01:18:52.512
You know, like, blue.

01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:02.529
There you go. Enjoy my book.

01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:04.861
Could you sign it "To
A Future Serial Mom"?

01:19:04.865 --> 01:19:07.158
Sure. You think she did it?

01:19:07.159 --> 01:19:08.576
I have reasonable doubt.

01:19:08.577 --> 01:19:12.038
I feel like killing a
couple people myself.

01:19:12.039 --> 01:19:13.331
Eight dollars, ma'am.

01:19:13.332 --> 01:19:16.626
And these books, these
disgusting books

01:19:16.627 --> 01:19:20.922
that so lovingly describe the
sadistic acts of serial killers,

01:19:20.923 --> 01:19:23.383
where did you find these
books, Detective?

01:19:23.384 --> 01:19:25.510
In Beverly Sutphin's trashcan.

01:19:27.346 --> 01:19:29.180
You may cross-examine,
Mrs. Sutphin.

01:19:29.181 --> 01:19:30.803
Thank you.

01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:40.108
Detective Gracey, if I were
to look through your trash,

01:19:40.109 --> 01:19:41.859
what reading materials
would I find?

01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:44.028
Objection! Immaterial!

01:19:44.029 --> 01:19:45.572
You may answer.

01:19:47.533 --> 01:19:51.327
Time, Sports Illustrated,
National Geographic.

01:19:51.328 --> 01:19:53.121
My wife gets Ladies' Home Journal.

01:19:53.872 --> 01:19:57.667
Yet, last night, we found in
your trashcan this magazine,

01:19:57.668 --> 01:19:59.585
Chicks with Dicks.

01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:10.923
God damn you. That's trespassing!

01:20:11.265 --> 01:20:15.643
Never judge a person by
what they read, Detective.

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:17.895
Your witness, Mr. Nazlerod.

01:20:17.896 --> 01:20:22.442
I am a married man. I hope
they give you the gas chamber!

01:20:26.822 --> 01:20:31.573
The jury is instructed to ignore
the outburst of the witness.

01:20:31.785 --> 01:20:34.955
I call to the stand
Rosemary Ackerman.

01:20:35.122 --> 01:20:39.167
Now, did you ever see the fire
poker again after you left it

01:20:39.168 --> 01:20:40.918
with Mrs. Sutphin?

01:20:40.919 --> 01:20:45.923
Yes, thirty minutes later. It
was covered with blood and gore

01:20:45.924 --> 01:20:48.968
and Carl Pageant was dead.

01:20:49.345 --> 01:20:51.422
No further questions.

01:20:52.097 --> 01:20:56.309
Mrs. Ackerman, when you left
me at the Antique Mart,

01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:57.807
where did you go?

01:20:58.979 --> 01:21:00.188
Browsing.

01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:03.441
Did Carl Pageant buy
something you wanted?

01:21:03.442 --> 01:21:07.070
I didn't want that Fabergé egg.
It was chipped.

01:21:07.071 --> 01:21:09.989
Carl Pageant died because
of you, didn't he?

01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:12.617
No. I would never hurt anybody.

01:21:12.618 --> 01:21:16.120
It was your Premiere magazine with
the letters cut out, wasn't it?

01:21:16.121 --> 01:21:17.955
Yes, but I lent it...

01:21:17.956 --> 01:21:22.335
And they were your scissors that were found
in Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?

01:21:22.336 --> 01:21:24.087
Yes. But I didn't...

01:21:24.088 --> 01:21:25.881
Mrs. Ackerman...

01:21:30.219 --> 01:21:31.966
Do you recycle?

01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:41.979
No.

01:21:45.651 --> 01:21:48.195
I don't have room in my kitchen.

01:21:54.034 --> 01:21:56.452
Detective Pike, did you then
proceed to the stage area

01:21:56.453 --> 01:21:57.537
inside Hammerjacks?

01:21:57.538 --> 01:21:59.414
Yes, I did. Scotty
Barnhill was on fire

01:21:59.415 --> 01:22:01.332
and he fell to his knees in flames.

01:22:01.333 --> 01:22:02.667
Would this be what you saw?

01:22:02.668 --> 01:22:06.087
Yes, sir. A real barbecue.

01:22:06.088 --> 01:22:08.965
May I show this photo to
the jury, Your Honor?

01:22:08.966 --> 01:22:10.216
Chip, she's here.

01:22:10.217 --> 01:22:13.637
They're entitled to see
Mrs. Sutphin's handiwork.

01:22:25.649 --> 01:22:28.898
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:22:30.195 --> 01:22:32.947
Your Honor, may the
photograph please be received

01:22:32.948 --> 01:22:35.158
into evidence and
shown to the jury?

01:22:35.159 --> 01:22:37.236
Oh, yeah. Yes, yes.

01:22:40.122 --> 01:22:42.916
Jeez, that really
is Suzanne Somers.

01:22:44.918 --> 01:22:48.418
Oh, I loved you in Three's Company.

01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:50.707
No further questions.

01:22:52.551 --> 01:22:55.300
I call to the stand Marvin Pickles.

01:23:02.394 --> 01:23:05.347
Mr. Pickles! Mr. Marvin Pickles!

01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:08.024
Be right out.

01:23:08.025 --> 01:23:09.775
The judge is waiting for you.

01:23:09.776 --> 01:23:11.102
Okay.

01:23:13.197 --> 01:23:15.149
Come on, get moving.

01:23:19.578 --> 01:23:21.329
State your name, please.

01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:22.830
Marvin A. Pickles.

01:23:22.831 --> 01:23:26.459
Mr. Pickles, were you in the men's
room at the Antique Trade Mart

01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:28.412
on Saturday, May 15?

01:23:30.214 --> 01:23:31.791
Yes, I was.

01:23:37.095 --> 01:23:40.473
Oh, hi. What was the rating?
Well, what was the share?

01:23:40.474 --> 01:23:43.473
Did you see anyone in
the booth next to you?

01:23:48.941 --> 01:23:50.608
Excuse me, I...

01:23:50.609 --> 01:23:53.861
Mr. Pickles, did you see anyone
in the booth next to you?

01:23:53.862 --> 01:23:58.115
I'm not sure... I...

01:23:58.116 --> 01:23:59.863
What do you mean you're not sure?

01:24:00.661 --> 01:24:02.662
There was nobody next to me.

01:24:02.663 --> 01:24:05.206
Mr. Pickles, didn't you
tell the Grand Jury

01:24:05.207 --> 01:24:06.958
that you looked down and you saw

01:24:06.959 --> 01:24:11.587
a pair of ladies' shoes
in the booth next to you?

01:24:11.588 --> 01:24:13.297
I just said what you told me to.

01:24:15.342 --> 01:24:18.386
Perjury is a serious
offense, Mr. Pickles.

01:24:21.181 --> 01:24:26.686
I... I made it all up! I've never
seen Beverly Sutphin in my life!

01:24:27.813 --> 01:24:30.687
You'll pay for this,
Marvin Pickles.

01:24:33.944 --> 01:24:36.943
I'm turning your file
over to the vice squad.

01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:44.329
The prosecution rests.

01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:53.170
The prosecution has proven
nothing, Your Honor.

01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:55.214
The defense rests also!

01:25:01.847 --> 01:25:04.300
Order. Order in the courtroom.

01:25:06.602 --> 01:25:08.519
We'll take a 10-minute recess.

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:11.348
Attorneys, be ready with
your closing arguments.

01:25:11.356 --> 01:25:14.734
Well, I feel that Beverly Sutphin

01:25:14.735 --> 01:25:17.358
is an innocent woman,
wrongly accused.

01:25:17.487 --> 01:25:22.443
A normal housewife trapped in a
nightmare of circumstantial evidence.

01:25:27.205 --> 01:25:31.751
There she is, Henrietta Lee
Lucas, Joan Wayne Gacy.

01:25:33.086 --> 01:25:36.756
A new face in the deck of
serial killer trading cards.

01:25:39.176 --> 01:25:45.222
Find her guilty on all six
counts of first-degree murder.

01:25:45.223 --> 01:25:49.769
I only hope I can portray Serial
Mom's life on the TV screen

01:25:49.770 --> 01:25:55.443
with the proper dignity that
this feminist heroine deserves.

01:25:56.318 --> 01:26:01.024
Look at me. I am as
normal as all of you.

01:26:04.034 --> 01:26:06.783
But I have been
framed by the police

01:26:08.914 --> 01:26:13.540
and perjured against by the very
people I thought were my friends.

01:26:14.252 --> 01:26:15.954
- All I ask of you...
- Stop that!

01:26:17.422 --> 01:26:21.634
Is that you have the courage
to find me innocent

01:26:21.635 --> 01:26:25.260
of these terribly untrue charges.

01:26:26.098 --> 01:26:28.891
All I ask is that you find me

01:26:28.892 --> 01:26:32.767
innocent of these
terribly untrue charges.

01:26:51.623 --> 01:26:54.917
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

01:26:54.918 --> 01:26:56.995
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

01:27:00.924 --> 01:27:04.970
We find the defendant not
guilty of all charges.

01:27:10.767 --> 01:27:12.685
Way to go, Beverly!

01:27:15.272 --> 01:27:18.191
Oh! I'm coming home!

01:27:24.531 --> 01:27:25.823
What should I do?

01:27:25.824 --> 01:27:28.075
I don't know. Bring
her home, I guess.

01:27:28.076 --> 01:27:30.661
No more violence. No more violence.

01:27:30.662 --> 01:27:32.364
You think she'll like me?

01:27:32.914 --> 01:27:38.371
Just be nice to her and try...
Try not to get on her nerves.

01:27:42.591 --> 01:27:43.758
She got off.

01:27:43.759 --> 01:27:44.925
She's innocent!

01:27:44.926 --> 01:27:46.343
Congratulations, Beverly.
Will you be staying...

01:27:46.344 --> 01:27:48.345
- Hello, Baltimore!
- I love you.

01:27:48.346 --> 01:27:50.055
Oh, I love you, too.

01:27:50.056 --> 01:27:53.726
Thank you all for coming. Hi,
there, LA. Hello, Cleveland.

01:27:53.727 --> 01:27:54.852
Hey, Serial Mom!

01:27:54.853 --> 01:27:56.061
Well, hello, New York!

01:27:56.062 --> 01:27:58.435
Beverly, who does your hair?

01:28:00.317 --> 01:28:01.442
Excuse me!

01:28:01.443 --> 01:28:02.943
Would you hold these for me, honey?

01:28:02.944 --> 01:28:04.069
Excuse me.

01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:06.697
Excuse me, Mr. Sutphin, can I
ask you a question, please?

01:28:06.698 --> 01:28:08.949
Did the system work?
Do you think it worked?

01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:11.160
Excuse me. The rights
have been sold.

01:28:11.161 --> 01:28:13.162
We did it. We set her free!

01:28:13.163 --> 01:28:15.616
I knew she was innocent
right from the beginning.

01:28:22.047 --> 01:28:24.882
You can't wear white
shoes after Labor Day.

01:28:24.883 --> 01:28:26.467
That's not true anymore.

01:28:26.468 --> 01:28:30.054
Yes, it is. Didn't your
mother ever tell you?

01:28:31.973 --> 01:28:33.595
Now you know.

01:28:34.893 --> 01:28:39.063
No, please. Fashion has changed.

01:28:39.064 --> 01:28:40.811
No, it hasn't.

01:28:42.442 --> 01:28:43.526
Are you surprised, Mr. Sutphin?

01:28:43.527 --> 01:28:45.946
No comment. Beverly?

01:28:46.655 --> 01:28:47.780
Here I am, honey.

01:28:47.781 --> 01:28:49.740
Beverly, hi! I'm Suzanne Somers.

01:28:49.741 --> 01:28:50.908
Hello!

01:28:50.909 --> 01:28:53.911
Mrs. Sutphin, can we get a shot
of you and Suzanne Somers?

01:28:53.912 --> 01:28:55.663
Absolutely, stand here, Beverly.

01:28:55.664 --> 01:28:57.248
Guys, what about a
nice two-shot, okay?

01:28:57.249 --> 01:28:58.415
No, Suzanne, really, I'd be much...

01:28:58.416 --> 01:29:00.167
Beverly, Beverly, stand right here!

01:29:00.168 --> 01:29:02.253
Okay, smile, Serial Mom!

01:29:02.254 --> 01:29:05.378
Suzanne Somers,
this is my bad side!
