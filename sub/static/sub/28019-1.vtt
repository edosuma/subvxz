10:10.740 --> 10:12.437
Do we really still need
to be here?

10:12.481 --> 10:14.352
Putting a police officer
inside might not do it.

10:14.396 --> 10:15.745
Whoever planned this,
they must have known

10:15.789 --> 10:17.704
it would be harder to kill Dawn
after killing Rob.

10:17.747 --> 10:19.619
And they still made the threat.
That shows confidence.

10:19.662 --> 10:21.229
Well, Eric has a point--
either the killer

10:21.272 --> 10:22.622
doesn't know
she's being protected

10:22.665 --> 10:24.406
or has a way
of killing her anyway.Exactly.

Delaine into custody.I know.

Truth is, instead of
calling the police,

11:20.157 --> 11:22.290
I called Viktor
Volynets,

11:22.333 --> 11:24.684
a man I knew
wanted Delaine dead.

11:24.727 --> 11:26.120
ZARA:
Eric.

11:26.163 --> 11:28.992
I didn't want Delaine going back
to prison.

11:29.036 --> 11:31.125
Been there before
and didn't stop him.

11:31.168 --> 11:34.694
After what he'd done
to Nathalie and Evie...

11:34.737 --> 11:36.783
I didn't want
him to live.

11:36.826 --> 11:39.220
So, you called the person
who would, um...

11:39.263 --> 11:42.310
get rid of him...

11:42.353 --> 11:44.660
no questions asked?

11:44.704 --> 11:46.531
And now...

11:46.575 --> 11:48.490
you don't know
if you can live with it.

11:48.533 --> 11:51.406
I'm gonna have to live with it.
I'm...

11:51.449 --> 11:53.669
I'm living with it.

11:53.713 --> 11:57.586
But I can't... lead with it.

11:57.629 --> 11:59.719
My core belief
is nonviolence.

12:01.938 --> 12:03.940
I betrayed myself.

12:05.463 --> 12:07.901
I betrayed you.

12:07.944 --> 12:11.513
That's why I'm no longer
considering selling Cri/Res.

12:13.167 --> 12:14.559
I'm doing it.

12:16.126 --> 12:17.388
[car door closes]

12:29.226 --> 12:30.793

12:33.187 --> 12:35.232
The next minute your boss
is confessing to murder

12:35.276 --> 12:37.234
and selling the company.

12:37.278 --> 12:38.670
Well, I didn't leave The Hague

12:38.714 --> 12:40.585
to work for two
guys I don't know.

12:40.629 --> 12:42.326
I left to work with Eric.

12:42.370 --> 12:44.502
Though I can't imagine the
hell he's going through.

12:44.546 --> 12:45.982
The man negotiates for a living,

12:46.026 --> 12:48.115
and yet this is not up
for discussion?

12:48.158 --> 12:49.638
It's ridiculous.

12:49.681 --> 12:51.335
Hey.

12:51.379 --> 12:54.121
So, I was just chatting
with a couple uniforms.

12:54.164 --> 12:56.123
They said police were called
three times

12:56.166 --> 12:57.820
because neighbors heard shouting

12:57.864 --> 12:59.779
at Dawn and Rob's
and feared domestic violence.

12:59.822 --> 13:01.606
Rob was never charged?No.

13:01.650 --> 13:04.000
There's something else
Dawn neglected to tell us.

13:04.044 --> 13:07.264
This is a background check.

13:07.308 --> 13:08.700
She was signing a lease
on her own place,

13:08.744 --> 13:10.180
due to move out next week.

13:10.224 --> 13:12.356
Because of the
domestic violence.Mm-hmm.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.923
Seems like an easy jump.

13:13.967 --> 13:16.186
What about Andre's dad?No priors.

13:16.230 --> 13:17.622
Not even a speeding ticket.

13:17.666 --> 13:19.320
He worked as a
building superintendent,

13:19.363 --> 13:22.105
which means he could have
dabbled in electrical work,

13:22.149 --> 13:23.803
so there's that.Hmm.

13:23.846 --> 13:26.327
What about NJay?Real name-- Norman James.

13:26.370 --> 13:29.199
The 64 Disciples started out
moving guns, selling drugs,

13:29.243 --> 13:30.810
but in the last five years,

13:30.853 --> 13:32.812
they've moved
into more legitimate business.

13:32.855 --> 13:34.161
Six Laundromats,
a nightclub,

13:34.204 --> 13:36.032
and a restaurant set
to open next month.

13:36.076 --> 13:38.687
Well, that's a lot to risk
on an extortion racket.Agreed.

13:38.730 --> 13:40.515
Apparently, these surveillance
photos were key evidence

13:40.558 --> 13:42.125
for the grand jury.

13:42.169 --> 13:43.997
Is that NJay?

13:44.040 --> 13:45.825
Yeah, it says here,
Andre visited him

13:45.868 --> 13:47.870
when he was doing time in
Grenville Correctional.

13:47.914 --> 13:50.220
I guess they were tight.ZARA:
When was this taken?

13:50.264 --> 13:51.918
The day before Andre was shot.

13:51.961 --> 13:53.789
So, he may have been
involved in the gang.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.573
Anything's possible.

13:55.617 --> 13:56.966
Okay. Well, I'm off
to meet Eric.

13:57.010 --> 13:58.620
NJay's at his nightclub.

13:58.663 --> 14:00.013
Catch you later.

14:00.056 --> 14:02.580
Hey, Zara?

14:03.625 --> 14:05.061
We need to talk
about Eric.

14:05.105 --> 14:06.802
Nothing
to talk about.

Zara.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.678
Look...

14:13.722 --> 14:15.593
Delaine tried
to destroy his daughter.

14:15.637 --> 14:17.944
Yeah, and Eric got Delaine
killed and didn't tell us.

14:17.987 --> 14:19.467
That's a problem.

14:19.510 --> 14:20.947
Well, he told us now.

14:20.990 --> 14:22.862
And he told us
he's selling Cri/Res.

14:22.905 --> 14:25.603
Once Eric's decided something,
there's no changing his mind.

14:25.647 --> 14:27.605
Yeah, I know.Well, then

16:00.655 --> 16:03.614
the ones aching for justice for
Andre-- they don't know that.

some kind of reparations

16:16.323 --> 16:18.194

that they robbed.

16:18.238 --> 16:20.022
How would we, uh,

16:20.066 --> 16:22.938
move forward?Well, hypothetically,

16:22.982 --> 16:25.071
we'd arrange a time
and place to drop the money.

16:25.114 --> 16:27.464

to get this deal done.

together, and we'll meet?

to last 50 lifetimes.

17:20.343 --> 17:23.303
That's why I moved my concerns
to legitimate business--

17:23.346 --> 17:25.435
so I can give back
to the community

17:25.479 --> 17:27.437

I'd stop trying

to negotiate, and I'd go
get them racks together.

his face when he found out

17:51.026 --> 17:52.462
that Rob was dead?

17:52.506 --> 17:54.334
Well, he did seem
genuinely surprised.

17:54.377 --> 17:57.032
He issued the extortion demand,
but he didn't kill Rob.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.295
So, why pay him
if he's notthe killer?

17:59.339 --> 18:01.254
Oh, because I'm betting
he knows who is.

18:01.297 --> 18:02.951

we hand over the money,

18:02.994 --> 18:04.822

He didn't want me

They would chat sometimes.

20:08.294 --> 20:11.166
