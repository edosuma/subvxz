00:01.929 --> 00:02.799
Previously;

00:03.129 --> 00:06.679
They've been feeding you your son's
blood so you'll like it and want more.

00:07.330 --> 00:09.289
Angelus is in his nature.
The beast will re-emerge.

00:09.730 --> 00:11.939
Wesley's taking the baby away,
for good.

00:15.130 --> 00:18.960
Hello, son. Your name is Steven
Franklin Thomas, and I'm your father.

00:19.329 --> 00:21.890
- Give us the kid.
- Anyone tries to take him, he dies.

00:22.329 --> 00:25.980
You look into the Quor-toth,
the darkest of the dark worlds.

00:26.530 --> 00:27.510
Daniel!

00:28.329 --> 00:32.090
There are no portals to Quor-toth.
Punching through requires dark magics.

00:32.530 --> 00:35.689
The kind of power
it takes centuries to build.

00:36.130 --> 00:40.450
There's almost always some
cosmic price to using primordial powers.

00:41.530 --> 00:43.670
- What are you fleeing from?
- The Destroyer.

00:43.929 --> 00:46.600
It's coming after you, Angel.

01:09.730 --> 01:11.030
Hi, Dad.

01:21.129 --> 01:22.849
Wait!

01:33.129 --> 01:35.200
No!

01:52.329 --> 01:53.489
Interesting.

02:49.849 --> 02:50.719
My God.

02:54.650 --> 02:55.520
It's you.

02:58.849 --> 03:00.180
Connor.

03:03.050 --> 03:04.419
Angel!

03:12.050 --> 03:13.909
Look, will you just stop for a--?

03:15.650 --> 03:17.860
- Can't we just talk about this?
- No.

03:19.250 --> 03:20.189
Wait!

03:30.650 --> 03:32.719
Okay, everybody just calm down.

03:46.250 --> 03:48.460
Angel, if Peter Pan here
doesn't stop--

04:34.250 --> 04:36.459
No!

04:38.449 --> 04:40.310
Connor!

04:41.449 --> 04:43.980
You're gonna fry out here, man.
Come on.

04:45.050 --> 04:45.920
We'll go.

05:11.449 --> 05:14.470
- Anybody get the bus number?
- 17. I'll see where it ends up.

05:15.050 --> 05:17.889
- Let me check online. It'll be faster.
- That was it, Angel.

05:19.250 --> 05:21.110
No, it isn't.
I'm gonna find him.

05:21.050 --> 05:24.350
The fight you just had. It was
the vision I warned you about.

05:25.250 --> 05:28.480
- You never mentioned Connor.
- Because I only saw you.

05:28.850 --> 05:32.569
Angel, we sure this was Connor?
Just because he said "Hi, Dad"?

05:33.649 --> 05:34.560
It was him.

05:35.449 --> 05:39.560
- He was just in diapers, now he's a teen?
- Tell me we don't live in a soap opera.

05:40.250 --> 05:43.899
I'm less worried about how he
grew up than why he came back.

05:44.449 --> 05:47.540
He came back because he could.
He found a way to escape that place.

05:48.050 --> 05:49.240
That's a possibility.

05:49.850 --> 05:53.500
Here's another: You sure he said
"Hi, Dad" and not "You're dead"?

05:54.050 --> 05:56.860
He's angry and afraid.
As soon as we talk-- Fred?

05:57.050 --> 05:58.839
The 17 ends up at Union Station.

05:59.449 --> 06:01.730
I'll go underground.
Somebody hit the streets.

06:02.449 --> 06:05.259
- You got it, man.
- We will not fail, man.

06:07.250 --> 06:08.300
Let's split up.

06:08.449 --> 06:10.449
You guys start at the end of the line,
work your way--

06:15.649 --> 06:18.279
Okay, that can't be good.

06:19.250 --> 06:22.509
The dimensional rift from Quor-toth
must still be open.

06:22.850 --> 06:26.709
Let's close it up before anything
else slithers or slides out of there.

06:27.649 --> 06:29.259
Amen to that.

06:29.449 --> 06:33.629
Princess, perhaps your newfound
powers can seal it shut.

06:37.850 --> 06:39.009
Can't hurt to try.

06:45.050 --> 06:47.610
I command you, close!

06:51.649 --> 06:53.540
Okay, I got nothing.

06:54.649 --> 06:58.439
- We do know somebody who might--
- No.

06:59.449 --> 07:02.079
I already went to Wes'.
Can't do that again.

07:04.850 --> 07:09.240
Well, I might know a guy
who knows another guy.

07:10.250 --> 07:11.860
Is it dangerous?

07:12.050 --> 07:15.310
It's not dangerous, it's just awkward.
This guy's all hands.

07:15.649 --> 07:19.269
I mean, all hands. Like, 50 of them.
Anybody fluent in sign language?

07:20.449 --> 07:22.980
We can't all leave when we have
a cosmic crack hanging over us.

07:23.449 --> 07:25.129
Then I will stay...

07:25.850 --> 07:27.149
...and guard the hotel.

07:28.250 --> 07:30.459
I'm with him. You two hit the streets.
Lorne?

07:31.250 --> 07:32.620
Already gone.

07:33.050 --> 07:35.120
You went to Wesley's for me.

07:37.250 --> 07:39.709
He's the one who told you
how to save me.

07:40.850 --> 07:42.600
Yeah. He made it clear.

07:43.250 --> 07:45.670
That's a door none of us
is ever gonna be knocking on again.

07:52.730 --> 07:56.060
I would've called, but I figured
you'd tell me to go to hell...

07:56.329 --> 07:59.100
...so I thought I'd just take a shot
and drop by.

08:00.529 --> 08:02.139
- Invite me in?
- No.

08:02.930 --> 08:04.050
Okay.

08:09.529 --> 08:13.709
Not what I expected. You know,
bunch of flowers, some get-well cards.

08:14.329 --> 08:17.949
Maybe a couple of those balloons
with the smiley faces on them.

08:21.529 --> 08:24.790
I guess when she slit your throat
she nicked your sense of humor.

08:25.129 --> 08:28.040
Not at all.
I find you being here extremely funny.

08:29.329 --> 08:32.419
- How's that?
- Because you're going to offer me a job.

08:35.330 --> 08:37.500
It's a shame, really, what happened.

08:37.730 --> 08:41.840
You dedicate your life to a cause,
and the very people you try to help...

08:43.730 --> 08:45.269
...turn their backs on you.

08:45.529 --> 08:47.529
Yes, tragic.

08:47.929 --> 08:49.299
Now get the hell out.

08:49.730 --> 08:52.850
A man with your talents, a scholar,
a man of intellect....

08:53.330 --> 08:55.789
Inside knowledge
of Angel Investigations.

08:56.330 --> 08:59.070
Did I mention Wolfram and Hart
has the finest library of...

08:59.929 --> 09:03.370
...mystical, occult and supernatural
reference material in the world?

09:04.129 --> 09:06.690
Full medical, dental, 4O1(k) package.

09:07.129 --> 09:09.830
- Not interested.
- Hey, it was worth a shot.

09:11.929 --> 09:16.570
Anyway, here's something to help pass
the time in the unemployment line.

09:25.730 --> 09:29.799
- Dante's Divine Comedy.
- It's just part one, "The Inferno."

09:31.730 --> 09:36.720
It's not a first edition. More like the
1500s. But it's in the original Tuscan.

09:37.730 --> 09:40.259
- Have you read it?
- Several times.

09:41.929 --> 09:44.950
Then you know it's a guided tour
of the nine levels of hell.

09:45.529 --> 09:49.080
Yes. Descending concentric rings
based on the severity of the sin.

09:49.730 --> 09:51.799
You know...

09:52.129 --> 09:55.850
...I always forget. At the very
bottom of hell, in the ninth circle...

09:56.330 --> 09:59.659
...the devil's frozen in ice, right?
He's got three heads, three mouths...

10:00.529 --> 10:03.649
...and those mouths are reserved
for the worst sinners.

10:04.129 --> 10:07.639
Now, I can't remember,
who is in the center mouth?

10:08.330 --> 10:09.590
What was his name?

10:10.129 --> 10:14.480
The one person in all of human history
deemed the greatest sinner....

10:15.529 --> 10:17.110
Who is it?

10:19.129 --> 10:21.019
Judas Iscariot.

10:21.529 --> 10:23.110
Right.

10:23.929 --> 10:28.039
The worst spot in hell is reserved
for those who betray.

10:33.529 --> 10:36.340
So don't pretend you're too good
to work for us.

11:11.570 --> 11:12.830
- Did you find him?
- No,

11:13.370 --> 11:15.580
We just missed him,
He's leaving a trail,

11:15.769 --> 11:17.870
What? Did he hurt somebody?

11:18.769 --> 11:21.860
No. I mean gawkers, folks not used
to seeing a kid in animal skins...

11:22.370 --> 11:25.320
...riding on top a bus. Well, not south
of Santa Monica Boulevard anyway.

11:25.970 --> 11:29.299
- Two more Robin Hood reports.
- Hear that? He's headed downtown.

11:29.570 --> 11:31.990
- Where are you?
- Just east of Union.

11:32.570 --> 11:34.360
- He won't head all the way into town.
- No?

11:34.970 --> 11:37.570
He'll head for someplace
less populated.

11:37.970 --> 11:41.690
- You want us to come get you?
- No. Just keep following the trail.

11:42.769 --> 11:45.049
The minute it goes cold, let me know.

11:45.169 --> 11:48.649
And if it doesn't go cold?
I mean, if we find him first?

11:49.370 --> 11:50.740
He's my son.

11:51.169 --> 11:53.940
He's my son, and he's alive.
He's gonna stay alive.

11:54.769 --> 11:58.320
- Anything else we can do for you?
- Yeah.

11:58.970 --> 12:00.690
Make the sun go down.

12:10.809 --> 12:14.070
Come on, Tyke.
Look, this stuff is good.

12:17.409 --> 12:20.570
Why are you being such a jerk?
I need it right now.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.120
Tyke, come on.

12:25.809 --> 12:27.559
Don't be such a jerk. Come on.

12:27.610 --> 12:30.980
Brand new, never opened.
They've gotta be worth half a gram.

12:33.009 --> 12:35.080
- They suck.
- They rock.

12:35.409 --> 12:39.409
Look, it's like every hit from the '80s.
Plus, this girl is hot.

12:40.809 --> 12:43.970
Get out of here, Sunny.
You're embarrassing yourself.

12:44.409 --> 12:46.730
They're worth at least
a quarter. Please.

12:47.409 --> 12:48.740
All right, okay.

12:49.809 --> 12:52.549
Bye! Bye! Bye!

12:55.210 --> 12:56.539
You jerk!

12:57.009 --> 12:59.110
- Ow!
- You know what?

12:59.409 --> 13:02.500
- That you get to work off.
- Let me go!

13:07.210 --> 13:09.379
- No!
- Walk away.

13:17.409 --> 13:20.389
An entire suit made of chammies.
That's different.

13:21.009 --> 13:24.029
"What are you wearing to the Oscars?"
"My chammy suit."

13:25.210 --> 13:27.070
What's all this?

13:28.809 --> 13:30.490
Things I killed.

13:33.610 --> 13:37.019
Aren't you all scary.
Chammies and teeth.

13:39.610 --> 13:41.610
Wanna know what else is scary?

13:45.009 --> 13:46.090
Me.

14:09.610 --> 14:11.289
Just get rid of him.

14:54.610 --> 14:55.840
No!

15:34.210 --> 15:35.370
Don't!

15:36.009 --> 15:39.659
Are you crazy? The police are probably
on their way. We gotta go.

15:48.610 --> 15:50.190
So he won't forget me.

16:01.450 --> 16:03.590
Isn't your neck stiff?

16:05.049 --> 16:07.259
You've been standing
like that all day.

16:08.049 --> 16:11.210
Pylean warriors are trained
for such endurance.

16:12.250 --> 16:14.740
I once happened upon
a herd of Burrbeasts.

16:15.250 --> 16:19.039
As you know, an engorged Burrbeast
will couple with anything that moves.

16:19.450 --> 16:22.500
I was forced to stand
perfectly still...

16:23.049 --> 16:25.049
...for 11 days and nights.

16:26.049 --> 16:27.980
So you were never...?

16:29.049 --> 16:30.059
No.

16:30.250 --> 16:32.139
That honor was yours, princess.

16:32.649 --> 16:33.840
I don't know.

16:34.450 --> 16:36.059
Angel does all that...

16:36.250 --> 16:40.389
...ninja-statue-don't-move-a-muscle-
or-you're-dead stuff too.

16:41.049 --> 16:44.460
Me? I wouldn't last 10 minutes.
Of course, heels? Not helping.

16:45.250 --> 16:48.870
Yes, I'm sure Angel has regaled you
with his many exploits.

16:49.450 --> 16:50.710
He's tried, all right.

16:51.250 --> 16:54.509
But I get so bored with all that
"days of yore" crap.

16:56.649 --> 17:01.039
I mean, they're nothing like
your thrilling tales of adventure.

17:01.450 --> 17:04.500
Not that you need adventurous
tales to impress me.

17:05.049 --> 17:07.440
I'm impressed by you just being you.

17:08.049 --> 17:10.819
But the way you constantly
speak of Angel....

17:11.650 --> 17:15.339
Is because these last weeks
have been so hard for him.

17:16.450 --> 17:17.960
He needs me.

17:19.450 --> 17:20.848
And you do too.

17:28.450 --> 17:31.609
I should be watching for creatures
from the other dimension.

17:32.650 --> 17:36.440
You're the only creature from another
dimension I'm interested in.

17:44.650 --> 17:48.269
I was worried that your affection
for the Groosalugg had waned.

18:03.609 --> 18:07.819
Some shopkeepers saw Connor jump off
the bus right up the road from here.

18:08.410 --> 18:09.990
He was here. I can smell him.

18:10.809 --> 18:13.759
Cops say it was a drug thing gone
wrong. Some guy got killed.

18:14.410 --> 18:17.430
It wasn't our boy.
They I.D.'d a local as the shooter.

18:18.009 --> 18:22.049
- So he was here, but not part of--?
- He was part of it. Lot of mayhem.

18:22.809 --> 18:24.670
Including a guy's ear
sliced off as a trophy.

18:24.609 --> 18:25.980
Ew....

18:26.410 --> 18:28.799
He was raised
in a hell dimension, okay?

18:30.009 --> 18:32.079
So how do you want to play this?

18:32.410 --> 18:35.319
It'll be dark soon.
You two head back to the hotel.

18:36.609 --> 18:39.869
- Shouldn't we all keep looking?
- I'll have a better chance alone.

18:40.809 --> 18:44.460
I don't want to scare him.
He's all alone in a strange world.

18:56.410 --> 18:58.480
So that was really cool today.

18:59.410 --> 19:02.500
So where'd you learn to fight all
badass like that?

19:04.210 --> 19:05.720
In Quor-toth.

19:06.609 --> 19:09.210
Quor-toth.... Mexico, right?

19:10.809 --> 19:11.859
Sorry.

19:13.809 --> 19:15.910
Lots of folks squat here.

19:16.809 --> 19:18.349
Most are cool, but...

19:18.609 --> 19:21.730
...if a fat guy asks you to play
"Teddy Bear in the Hole"...

19:22.210 --> 19:23.890
...just tell him to get lost.

19:25.210 --> 19:28.650
So, what did you do for kicks
in Quor-toth?

19:29.410 --> 19:32.150
- Kicks?
- You know, like, fun.

19:34.809 --> 19:37.369
Parties, movies, the mall?

19:40.210 --> 19:43.119
- How'd you spend your time?
- I hunt.

19:44.410 --> 19:45.779
Big surprise.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.150
Home sweet home.

20:13.210 --> 20:14.539
This is....

20:15.009 --> 20:16.690
This is home.

20:17.410 --> 20:18.920
Tonight it is.

20:24.009 --> 20:26.039
You're welcome to crash here too.

20:36.009 --> 20:40.819
Don't think it's your size.
People squat here, and they leave stuff.

20:45.009 --> 20:47.150
So...

20:48.009 --> 20:51.519
...how you feel about losing the whole
dead-animal thing?

20:56.410 --> 20:57.599
I mean...

20:58.210 --> 21:00.809
...not that I'm against
eating a cheeseburger.

21:12.009 --> 21:14.569
We have all the food groups.
Meat...

21:15.609 --> 21:16.940
...chocolate.

21:19.809 --> 21:22.829
- So you were really going to kill Tyke.
- He was hurting you.

21:23.410 --> 21:25.660
- Well, it's good you didn't.
- Why?

21:31.210 --> 21:34.509
Because it's wrong.

21:35.410 --> 21:36.319
I mean...

21:37.210 --> 21:39.309
...I know Tyke's a bastard, but...

21:40.210 --> 21:42.069
...cops are even worse.

21:42.609 --> 21:43.730
I love these.

21:46.210 --> 21:47.720
Have you ever had one?

21:50.410 --> 21:52.660
Well, then get on down here, cowboy.

22:04.809 --> 22:06.559
Isn't it the best?

22:15.009 --> 22:17.920
I know this.
A tool for eating.

22:19.210 --> 22:21.490
Um.... No.

22:22.210 --> 22:25.789
That isn't for food.

22:30.009 --> 22:33.240
It's for this.
I get it from Tyke.

22:36.609 --> 22:38.400
It's medicine.

22:39.609 --> 22:41.119
You're sick?

22:42.009 --> 22:44.890
No, it's not that kind of medicine.

22:46.210 --> 22:48.880
It helps me sometimes when I'm...

22:49.809 --> 22:51.039
...sad.

22:52.809 --> 22:54.319
You're sad?

22:56.410 --> 22:57.740
No.

23:05.410 --> 23:08.359
Connor's new to this world,
alone, probably scared,

23:09.009 --> 23:12.660
- He looked scared kicking my ass.
- We should've gone with Angel.

23:13.210 --> 23:16.579
Especially now that we know
what Connor's capable of.

23:26.650 --> 23:29.279
Food, cash...

23:29.650 --> 23:31.369
...place to crash....

23:32.049 --> 23:34.079
I've had worse days.

23:35.049 --> 23:36.380
How about you?

23:41.650 --> 23:43.470
So, what's your deal?

23:47.650 --> 23:49.579
Why did you come to L.A.?

23:53.650 --> 23:55.329
To find my father.

23:56.049 --> 23:57.240
Really?

23:57.849 --> 23:59.920
I came here to get away from mine.

24:03.250 --> 24:06.970
Parents should have to take a test
before they can have kids.

24:07.450 --> 24:09.660
And if they're drunks or idiots...

24:10.450 --> 24:12.910
...or evil, they should
just be sterilized.

24:13.450 --> 24:16.259
If they're evil,
they should be killed.

24:20.650 --> 24:23.980
You don't say much,
but I like what you say.

24:45.250 --> 24:48.869
I'll be right back.

25:37.329 --> 25:38.730
Sunny?

26:22.930 --> 26:24.119
Sunny?

26:46.329 --> 26:47.490
Sunny.

27:01.329 --> 27:02.559
Connor.

27:12.289 --> 27:14.430
- She put any of this crap in you?
- No.

27:14.690 --> 27:16.019
Okay.

27:17.089 --> 27:18.349
Sorry, I'm just....

27:21.890 --> 27:23.750
We'll take care of this, okay?

27:24.289 --> 27:25.799
Together.

27:27.289 --> 27:28.799
Too late.

27:29.690 --> 27:30.920
Too late.

27:33.289 --> 27:34.480
Connor.

27:36.890 --> 27:38.259
I'm sorry about....

27:38.690 --> 27:40.200
Was she your friend?

27:41.089 --> 27:43.190
Connor, just talk to me.

27:44.690 --> 27:49.220
You must be feeling like you just traded
one hell dimension for another...

27:50.089 --> 27:51.670
...but if you just let me....

27:52.490 --> 27:54.380
What are you doing?

27:55.490 --> 27:57.809
- What is that?
- Give it back.

27:58.490 --> 28:00.740
Why? Who are you tracking?

28:04.490 --> 28:07.299
You're going after the guy
who gave her the junk.

28:08.089 --> 28:11.349
- His medicine killed her.
- And you're gonna do what about it?

28:11.690 --> 28:13.720
- Punish.
- You mean kill.

28:15.890 --> 28:17.259
Slow down.

28:19.490 --> 28:21.029
Listen to me.

28:23.089 --> 28:24.460
No!

28:30.890 --> 28:32.920
You will listen.

28:37.490 --> 28:41.630
I'm not gonna let you walk out that
door and get in any more trouble.

28:42.289 --> 28:43.450
Hear me?

28:44.690 --> 28:46.019
Fine.

28:59.690 --> 29:01.200
I'm sorry.

29:02.089 --> 29:05.039
- You just don't understand this world.
- I understand.

29:06.289 --> 29:08.250
Sunny was nice.
Now she's dead.

29:08.690 --> 29:10.859
- Connor--
- Stop calling me that!

29:14.089 --> 29:15.630
My name is Steven.

29:23.329 --> 29:25.079
- And then what?
- And then nothing.

29:25.730 --> 29:29.730
Standing, talking....
Boom! Knocked on our butts.

29:30.529 --> 29:34.289
- You think something else came out?
- Hello? Face down, knocked out?

29:35.329 --> 29:38.029
I found a picture of that beast
Connor killed.

29:38.329 --> 29:41.839
And it says that these things
usually have a mate.

29:46.730 --> 29:49.150
Lorne should have been back
with that expert hours ago.

29:49.730 --> 29:51.759
Well, he said it was complicated.

29:52.130 --> 29:54.730
There's that other expert.

29:55.730 --> 29:57.619
You know someone else who can--?

29:59.930 --> 30:03.089
I don't think Angel's
going to go for that.

30:04.130 --> 30:07.390
Yes, we must always consider Angel.
Angel is our leader.

30:07.730 --> 30:09.730
We must obey his wishes.

30:10.130 --> 30:13.710
We're supposed to sit here with a fissure
from a hell dimension in the lobby...

30:14.930 --> 30:17.250
...when we know someone
who can help us?

30:19.130 --> 30:22.990
- I don't think so. I'm calling him.
- Fred. No, you're not.

30:25.730 --> 30:28.150
- Lorne.
- Sorry it took so long, kids.

30:28.130 --> 30:31.319
Mistress Myrna is a very difficult
woman to find.

30:36.529 --> 30:39.059
You see what I mean?
It's been like this all day.

30:39.529 --> 30:43.079
One of the nasty side effects
of specializing in dimensional magic.

30:44.329 --> 30:47.380
What I wouldn't do for a lasso
and some Krazy Glue.

30:49.130 --> 30:50.460
Steven.

30:57.529 --> 30:58.829
Okay.

31:00.529 --> 31:01.690
Steven.

31:02.930 --> 31:04.329
It's a good name.

31:05.329 --> 31:07.650
Not Irish, but....

31:10.130 --> 31:14.799
I know we haven't gotten off
to a great start, but if we can just...

31:15.529 --> 31:16.930
...take a minute...

31:18.529 --> 31:21.440
...that'd be good. Please, just....

31:25.730 --> 31:28.990
Don't run away from me, all right?
I lost you once already.

31:31.130 --> 31:32.460
There's just....

31:33.529 --> 31:37.670
There's just so much I want to know.
There's so much I need to know.

31:47.930 --> 31:49.160
You been okay?

31:49.730 --> 31:52.640
I mean, what was it like there?

31:55.130 --> 31:57.299
Do you have any friends?

31:58.130 --> 32:00.380
Okay, I mean, not friends.

32:01.130 --> 32:04.460
It's not like you were at summer camp.
You were stuck...

32:06.529 --> 32:08.849
...in a hell dimension.

32:09.529 --> 32:11.950
Connor, I'm so sorry.

32:12.529 --> 32:16.109
I tried to come after you.
I would've done anything. I just--

32:16.730 --> 32:20.029
- I couldn't find a way in.
- I found a way out.

32:20.329 --> 32:21.490
Yeah.

32:23.930 --> 32:26.559
You did. You sure did.

32:29.329 --> 32:33.829
I should have tried harder.
I shouldn't have quit.

32:35.329 --> 32:36.730
But you're back.

32:37.730 --> 32:42.890
And that's what's important, you know?
You came back to me.

32:43.730 --> 32:47.240
I want to know everything, son.
I want to know everything.

32:47.930 --> 32:50.769
Everything about you.
What your life's been like.

32:51.529 --> 32:54.970
You must have a million questions.

32:55.730 --> 32:56.710
No.

32:58.130 --> 33:00.690
- No?
- My father told me everything.

33:03.529 --> 33:04.900
Your father?

33:07.130 --> 33:08.740
Holtz isn't your father--

33:08.930 --> 33:12.410
You don't get to say that name.
You don't even get to think it.

33:15.529 --> 33:17.180
I know everything.

33:19.130 --> 33:21.160
He told me all about you.

33:22.130 --> 33:23.359
That you're a...

33:24.529 --> 33:25.829
...thing that...

33:26.329 --> 33:29.349
...kills and drinks blood.

33:30.529 --> 33:33.339
- You're a vampire.
- What do you know about vampires?

33:33.529 --> 33:35.849
Decapitation, stake in the heart...

33:36.529 --> 33:38.990
...daylight, fire. I forget anything?

33:41.329 --> 33:43.049
You have a second face.

33:44.329 --> 33:46.049
A face for killing.

33:48.529 --> 33:50.039
Show it to me.

33:52.130 --> 33:53.920
I want to see it.

33:55.130 --> 33:58.079
Show me the face you used
to kill my father's family.

33:59.930 --> 34:02.099
Show me! Come on, show me!

34:06.529 --> 34:08.280
It looks like this, son.

34:08.929 --> 34:10.610
That's what you are.

34:12.530 --> 34:14.389
It's part of what I am.

34:17.329 --> 34:20.099
A part I hope you'll be able
to accept one day.

34:20.929 --> 34:24.230
- You'd have to kill me first.
- Well, that's a plan.

34:26.329 --> 34:28.010
But I got a better one.

34:34.849 --> 34:37.869
- Chammy man.
- No, no, no. Don't.

34:39.650 --> 34:41.400
Where's Sunny?

34:42.050 --> 34:44.119
Would that be the dead girl
in the bathroom?

34:47.449 --> 34:49.239
- Who are you?
- I'm his father.

34:49.849 --> 34:52.340
- No, you're not.
- Will you let me handle this?

34:59.449 --> 35:02.710
Let's find a way to work this out.
Talk through it.

35:04.250 --> 35:06.179
Which is a thing that we do here.

35:07.250 --> 35:08.969
There's no need for violence.

35:12.050 --> 35:16.260
I'm sorry, did you say "no need for
violence"? You may want to speak up.

35:16.849 --> 35:19.619
You see, I don't hear so good anymore!

35:22.250 --> 35:25.159
Sunny's dead in the can. OD.

35:25.849 --> 35:27.460
I begged her to get help.

35:28.250 --> 35:31.230
- One down, one to go.
- We can make this right.

35:31.849 --> 35:34.269
You can give me a new ear?

35:34.849 --> 35:39.630
- Well, maybe you can wear a hat.
- Maybe I could blow your head off.

35:40.849 --> 35:45.030
That's my coat. And whatever's not in
Sunny's body better be in the pockets.

35:46.250 --> 35:48.500
- Son, give him the coat.
- You killed her.

35:49.849 --> 35:50.929
Tyke!

35:51.650 --> 35:55.019
Cops, man. They're looking for you.
They're everywhere.

36:02.449 --> 36:05.360
I hope this pentagram wasn't some
dark attempt to close the fissure.

36:06.050 --> 36:08.789
No, that was a dark attempt
to open one.

36:10.250 --> 36:12.880
Different one. Long story.

36:17.449 --> 36:20.570
So you think you can close it then?

36:21.050 --> 36:23.150
Sure. That's not the worry.

36:24.050 --> 36:25.059
You have worry?

36:25.250 --> 36:29.389
How did it open? There are no portals
to Quor-toth, and for good reason.

36:30.050 --> 36:32.300
It's not a place anyone should ever go.

36:33.050 --> 36:37.469
If there aren't any portals,
what is it?

36:38.449 --> 36:41.429
A tear in reality. Big cosmic no-no.

36:48.050 --> 36:50.610
Something punched its way through.

36:51.650 --> 36:54.739
Something I really don't want to meet.
Excuse me.

36:55.250 --> 36:56.480
Sorry.

36:57.650 --> 37:00.769
Here you go.
Just the way you asked.

37:02.449 --> 37:04.480
Should we leave
or get behind something?

37:04.849 --> 37:08.780
No, it's pretty routine. Just sometimes
I get a little schmutz in my eye.

37:34.849 --> 37:36.429
It's closed.

37:36.650 --> 37:38.539
Did anything
else come through it?

37:39.050 --> 37:43.050
Not sure, and not sticking around
to find out. Bye.

37:50.010 --> 37:52.360
Dead body in the river,
another one in the bathroom.

37:53.010 --> 37:55.570
It just does not bode
well for you, does it?

37:56.610 --> 38:00.260
You see, son, violence
just always ends up badly!

38:10.409 --> 38:11.420
Hey!

38:30.210 --> 38:33.929
- Connor, we've gotta get out--
- I've gotta get out of here!

38:36.809 --> 38:38.070
Don't.

38:39.210 --> 38:40.329
Use me.

38:40.409 --> 38:42.940
I'm bigger.
I'll make a better shield.

38:44.610 --> 38:47.309
L.A.P.D. ! Drop your weapons!

39:26.610 --> 39:28.889
Out that window!
Go! Out the window!

39:29.610 --> 39:31.429
Stay down! Stay down!

39:54.210 --> 39:55.079
Go!

40:08.010 --> 40:10.039
- Do you need to stop?
- I'm okay.

40:11.010 --> 40:12.590
Get behind here.

40:20.010 --> 40:22.039
Maybe I do need a second.

40:24.210 --> 40:25.539
What you did....

40:26.610 --> 40:27.940
You hurt?

40:30.809 --> 40:34.289
You know, if you want,
you can come back to the hotel.

40:38.010 --> 40:39.760
No pressure or anything.

40:39.809 --> 40:43.139
- No....
- But if you need a place to stay....

40:44.010 --> 40:46.260
- I have to go.
- You're not alone.

40:49.409 --> 40:50.780
You know that, right?

40:53.010 --> 40:55.920
Yeah. I know.

41:41.610 --> 41:44.280
- Hello, son.
- Hi, Dad.
