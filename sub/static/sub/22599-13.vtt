Whoever he is...

14:52.434 --> 14:56.647
...I hope my counterpart on your world
will have a chance to repay you.

[PLASTIC MAN GRUNTING]

15:19.378 --> 15:21.213
Hope you like taffy, Plastic Man.

15:21.463 --> 15:24.174
You're about to become it.

15:25.843 --> 15:28.053
My own invention, Blue Beetle.

15:28.304 --> 15:31.056
Heroes check in,
but they don't check out.

15:35.269 --> 15:36.812
Atom, at your size...

15:37.104 --> 15:41.692
...a hit from a single lead particle
will be like a direct shot from a cannonball.

15:41.942 --> 15:44.361
Speaking of shots...

15:45.529 --> 15:48.115
Yeah, okay, I get it.

OWLMAN: When this magnet
tears you apart, Red Tornado...

...Clock King will get a chance
to see what makes you tick.

15:57.666 --> 15:59.585
BATMAN:
So you recruited these venomous vipers...

15:59.835 --> 16:02.796
...to help you with your diabolical scheme.

16:11.388 --> 16:12.640
Of course, Batman.

16:12.890 --> 16:15.225
Seems they wanted to see
all of you iced too.

16:15.476 --> 16:19.939
So I repeat, give me the phase oscillator
or the heroes die.

16:20.522 --> 16:22.650
And you lose your only ticket home.

16:55.516 --> 16:56.433
OWLMAN:
Time out.

16:56.684 --> 17:01.397
Since Batman's being such a spoilsport,
Joker, maybe you'll wanna play along.

17:01.397 --> 17:05.067
I knew you were coming,
so I planned a surprise just for you.

[MACHINE BUZZES]

17:24.086 --> 17:28.632
Your very own trap, primed and ready
for Batman, if you're interested.

17:36.515 --> 17:38.017
Joker?

17:38.267 --> 17:41.103
Oh, Bat-buddy, we shared some laughs...

17:41.353 --> 17:45.274
...and I really gave the hero thing
the old clown-college try.

17:45.566 --> 17:47.860
But it's just not me.

[GRUNTS]

18:20.809 --> 18:23.187
I'll be taking what's mine now.

When I return with my friends,
we'll take everything else.

18:32.696 --> 18:34.531
BATMAN:
I knew you'd betray me, Joker.

18:35.199 --> 18:38.577
You said it.
In the end, I'd have to count on myself.

18:38.869 --> 18:42.664
So in the split second I was gone,
I spent a week visiting parallel Earths.

18:42.915 --> 18:45.626
Traveling alone is a great way
to get in touch with yourself.

18:46.376 --> 18:52.341
In fact, I really bonded with me,
myself and I.

there is a decent man.

I'll have the trump card.
