WEBVTT

00:02.316 --> 00:06.082
My name is Shake-Zula,
the Mic Ruler,

00:06.153 --> 00:07.017
The old schooler

00:07.087 --> 00:08.019
You want to trip?

00:08.087 --> 00:09.521
l'll bring it to you

00:09.590 --> 00:12.218
Frylock, and l'm on top,
rock you like a cop

00:12.293 --> 00:15.023
Meatwad, you're up next
with your knock-knock

00:15.095 --> 00:17.655
Meatwad make the money, see?

00:17.731 --> 00:20.097
Meatwad get the honeys, "G"

00:20.167 --> 00:22.658
Drivin' in my car,
livin' like a star

00:22.736 --> 00:25.899
lce on my fingers and my toes,
and l'm a Taurus

00:25.973 --> 00:28.441
Unh, check, check it, yeah

00:28.509 --> 00:30.670
'Cause we are the Aqua Teens

00:30.744 --> 00:34.145
Make the homies say "ho!"
and the girlies want to scream

00:34.215 --> 00:36.149
'Cause we are the Aqua Teens

00:36.217 --> 00:39.675
Make the homies say "ho!"
and the girlies want to scream

00:39.753 --> 00:41.687
Aqua Teen Hunger Force

00:41.755 --> 00:43.780
Number one in the hood, "G"

00:45.559 --> 00:48.858
Terrence, you have my heart

00:48.929 --> 00:53.491
Ohhh, Terrence,
you have my soul

00:54.869 --> 00:59.602
Terrence,
you ate a bug today

00:59.673 --> 01:03.734
He's no longer moving

01:04.845 --> 01:09.009
You spit him out

01:09.083 --> 01:14.180
His shell don't taste good

01:14.255 --> 01:18.555
But you ate part of his brain

01:18.626 --> 01:20.253
lt is time.

01:20.327 --> 01:21.954
This is home

01:22.029 --> 01:26.261
This is Main Street

01:29.436 --> 01:30.630
Terrence?

01:35.542 --> 01:38.171
What was that?

01:38.245 --> 01:39.371
Damn it.

01:39.446 --> 01:40.913
A lot of time,
these Korean capacitors,

01:40.981 --> 01:42.915
they can't take this
many ohms.

01:42.983 --> 01:46.350
And then double the problems
when you're trying to defrost

01:46.420 --> 01:47.512
somebody's kitty cat in there.

01:47.588 --> 01:48.577
Someone's kitty cat?

01:48.656 --> 01:50.487
Whose kitty cat?

01:50.557 --> 01:52.923
Whose do you think?

01:52.993 --> 01:55.291
Yours?

01:55.362 --> 01:57.057
This is Mr. Sparkles.

01:57.131 --> 01:59.156
He is a magician,
and he is not to be touched.

01:59.233 --> 02:01.758
Then whose kitty cat
we talking about here?

02:01.835 --> 02:03.029
Well do the math.

02:03.103 --> 02:04.001
You had one.

02:04.071 --> 02:05.402
Now you have none.

02:05.472 --> 02:07.497
What does that equal?

02:07.875 --> 02:08.864
Terrence! No!

02:08.943 --> 02:09.931
Terrence...

02:10.009 --> 02:11.671
Boom!

02:11.745 --> 02:13.372
Terrence

02:13.447 --> 02:15.847
My skinless love

02:15.916 --> 02:18.077
l am the king!

02:18.152 --> 02:18.982
Oh, yeah.

02:19.053 --> 02:21.385
And the king is gonna sleep out
in the yard tonight.

02:21.455 --> 02:22.683
The grass?

02:22.756 --> 02:26.055
That is not a slumber chamber
fit for a king!

02:27.094 --> 02:28.220
Wrong again.

02:28.295 --> 02:29.626
The rings must be joined.

02:29.697 --> 02:32.723
lf you don't learn this, we're
never gonna get into that condo.

02:33.734 --> 02:35.031
Hark!

02:35.102 --> 02:37.434
The first firefly
of the summer solstice.

02:37.504 --> 02:39.199
Fetch my royal net.

02:39.707 --> 02:41.265
Oh.
Hey.

02:41.342 --> 02:42.502
Yeah.

02:42.576 --> 02:43.474
You dropped something.

02:43.544 --> 02:44.442
Eh, that's okay.

02:44.511 --> 02:45.409
l don't need it anymore.

02:45.479 --> 02:47.106
What if it's a golden egg?

02:47.181 --> 02:49.206
How about you crack it open
with your teeth

02:49.283 --> 02:50.682
and see if it is?

02:52.386 --> 02:53.717
Ugh! lt's not!

02:55.689 --> 02:56.519
Sucker.

02:57.124 --> 02:59.115
He was a fine pet,

02:59.193 --> 03:01.661
good friend, and he was very
cherished, and...

03:01.729 --> 03:02.559
what was he?

03:02.629 --> 03:03.960
lt's a she, thank you.

03:04.031 --> 03:05.089
And his name was Terrence.

03:05.165 --> 03:06.894
Oh, sorry, Meatwad.
Yes, she.

03:06.967 --> 03:09.697
And now she's gone.

03:09.770 --> 03:11.032
Her life's...

03:11.105 --> 03:12.333
...snuffed out in its prime.

03:12.406 --> 03:14.772
Oh, my god, what is that smell?!

03:14.842 --> 03:16.002
l'll tell you what.

03:16.076 --> 03:19.512
lt's called Carl... right there,
where he dropped that deuce.

03:19.580 --> 03:20.512
Man, this is some bull.

03:20.581 --> 03:21.809
Man, l don't care that
we don't get along.

03:21.882 --> 03:24.043
He needs to be using his
own toilet!

03:24.118 --> 03:26.211
Carl, get out here!

03:26.286 --> 03:27.583
You need to answer for this!

03:30.057 --> 03:30.921
He looks busy.

03:30.991 --> 03:33.653
Yeah, let it go. You're not gonna be
able to stop him now.

03:33.727 --> 03:34.557
What do you mean?

03:34.628 --> 03:36.255
lt's called Reedickyoulus.

03:36.330 --> 03:38.798
Ain't you never seen
the ad on TV?

03:38.866 --> 03:41.835
"Hey, baby, come back to pick
you up later."

03:41.902 --> 03:43.199
Only it ain't "pick" they saying.

03:43.270 --> 03:44.100
lt's another word.

03:44.171 --> 03:46.571
lt sound like "pick, " but it's
like an inverted "P"

03:46.640 --> 03:47.470
at the beginning.

03:47.541 --> 03:50.203
So, you know, it's a different
word that sound like "pick, "

03:50.277 --> 03:52.177
but it ain't the word "pick."

03:52.246 --> 03:53.213
lt's a different word.

03:53.280 --> 03:54.577
l get it. l get it.

03:54.648 --> 03:55.637
Then get it.

03:55.716 --> 03:56.808
Get me one.

03:56.884 --> 03:57.714
What does it do?

03:57.785 --> 04:01.687
lt lengthens, hardens, girthens,
strengthens,

04:01.755 --> 04:05.020
satisfies, and fully pleasures
your crotch.

04:06.193 --> 04:07.592
lt doesn't look safe.

04:07.661 --> 04:08.491
lt's not.

04:08.562 --> 04:10.029
They've been sued many times,

04:10.097 --> 04:12.258
but women don't get turned
on by safe.

04:12.332 --> 04:14.163
They crave danger.

04:14.234 --> 04:15.132
Yeah.

04:15.202 --> 04:16.668
They want a man who will try
anything,

04:16.737 --> 04:18.671
no matter how disreputable
the company.

04:19.940 --> 04:21.271
When it shuts off,

04:21.341 --> 04:23.172
l'm gonna have to have a talk
with him.

04:23.243 --> 04:25.677
Hey!
Check that out!

04:25.746 --> 04:26.906
What?!

04:26.980 --> 04:28.572
Yeah, l know!

04:28.649 --> 04:30.549
You're sad about it, right?!

04:30.617 --> 04:31.811
What?!

04:31.885 --> 04:34.251
Hold on!

04:42.830 --> 04:45.697
Mr. Sparkles!

04:45.766 --> 04:46.630
What?!

04:47.734 --> 04:49.895
We're gathered here
today to say goodbye

04:49.970 --> 04:51.494
to another...

04:51.572 --> 04:52.561
What's his name?

04:52.639 --> 04:54.072
Mr. Sparkles!

04:54.141 --> 04:55.938
And he was a wonderful magician!

04:56.009 --> 04:57.874
Hey!
lt stinks out here!

05:00.080 --> 05:01.513
Carl, we need...
O-oh.

05:01.648 --> 05:02.672
Carl, we need to talk.

05:02.749 --> 05:03.909
Hang on, Fry Man.

05:03.984 --> 05:05.645
l got to cop a squat.

05:05.719 --> 05:07.209
The deuce is loose.

05:08.288 --> 05:11.314
l got a big brown dog barking at
my back door.

05:11.391 --> 05:12.221
You know what l mean?

05:12.292 --> 05:13.122
Yeah.

05:13.193 --> 05:14.125
What are you doing?

05:14.194 --> 05:15.991
Look, hey, you talk to
me all you want.

05:16.063 --> 05:17.189
Just don't look at me.

05:17.264 --> 05:18.492
l mean, it freezes me up.

05:18.565 --> 05:22.934
l don't know if it's science or
nothing, but somehow, it knows.

05:29.009 --> 05:30.840
What in the hell is
wrong with you?

05:30.911 --> 05:32.606
Dude, my porcelain melted.

05:32.679 --> 05:33.941
l got to go somewhere.

05:34.014 --> 05:34.946
Holy...

05:35.015 --> 05:36.107
Carl, it's glowing.

05:36.183 --> 05:37.150
And you are, too.

05:37.217 --> 05:38.309
Look at your groin.

05:38.385 --> 05:41.684
Minor side effects that
will go away over time...

05:41.755 --> 05:43.313
While you're

05:43.390 --> 05:45.187
having a good time.

05:46.193 --> 05:47.956
You know what l'm saying?

05:48.028 --> 05:49.461
Ohhh!

05:49.530 --> 05:51.623
You guys got a machete or a
bolt cutter or something?

05:51.698 --> 05:52.528
Nah.

05:52.599 --> 05:55.033
Look, Carl, we're a little
concerned about what's going on.

05:55.102 --> 05:56.091
Well, don't be.

05:56.170 --> 05:59.037
Unlike you,
l'm going for the brass ring.

05:59.106 --> 06:01.404
Speaking of brass ring,
though, come here.

06:01.475 --> 06:02.407
Look at this.

06:02.476 --> 06:04.205
Does this look normal to you?

06:04.278 --> 06:05.302
Ew, man.

06:05.379 --> 06:06.209
Not even close.

06:06.280 --> 06:07.770
lt looks like a tiny city.

06:07.848 --> 06:08.678
Oh, man.

06:08.749 --> 06:11.274
l'm supposed to call
the help line if that happens.

06:12.486 --> 06:15.284
lf you experience symptoms
such as gleaming feces,

06:15.355 --> 06:16.549
luminescent groin flesh,

06:16.623 --> 06:19.592
or ghosts are escaping out of
your anus, please press 1.

06:20.994 --> 06:22.552
What's that in your pants?

06:22.629 --> 06:24.290
Mesh underwear.

06:24.364 --> 06:27.663
lt's like going commando,
but you still got control.

06:27.734 --> 06:29.861
Comes with the unit...
cools it down.

06:29.937 --> 06:32.997
Otherwise, it'll overheat, and
you got to, you know,

06:33.073 --> 06:33.903
apply a solution.

06:34.975 --> 06:36.738
Uh, yeah, well, l have...

06:36.810 --> 06:38.778
experienced some symptoms, yes.

06:40.113 --> 06:41.944
No, l won't sign a release.

06:43.350 --> 06:45.409
Yeah, sure, a set of steak
knives sound good.

06:45.485 --> 06:46.315
What's your point?

06:47.287 --> 06:48.811
They'll cut through a can?

06:48.889 --> 06:50.413
And then they cut tomato?

06:50.490 --> 06:52.287
You need an address, or, uh...

06:53.460 --> 06:55.121
You can see me? How is that...

06:55.195 --> 06:56.685
Unh!

07:02.970 --> 07:03.868
Look at this...

07:03.937 --> 07:05.529
it's melted straight through
the floor.

07:05.606 --> 07:07.631
Don't bring
that in my house.

07:07.708 --> 07:10.302
The radioactive mercury isotopes
are off the charts!

07:10.377 --> 07:11.810
Do you know what this means?

07:11.878 --> 07:13.038
Yeah.

07:13.113 --> 07:14.546
lt means new carpets, bitch.

07:14.615 --> 07:16.207
Hell, yeah, it does.

07:16.283 --> 07:17.545
Give me some.
Finally!

07:17.618 --> 07:20.212
l've been telling him and
telling the landlord that

07:20.287 --> 07:21.914
we're not gonna re-sign that
lease.

07:21.989 --> 07:23.980
Now he has to repair it.

07:26.760 --> 07:27.658
Go, Frylock!

07:27.728 --> 07:29.958
Let's all smoke
some cigarettes to celebrate.

07:30.030 --> 07:30.860
No, Shake!

07:30.931 --> 07:32.489
The gas leak!

07:32.566 --> 07:34.557
All right, mom.

07:36.303 --> 07:38.430
Yes, may l help you?

07:38.505 --> 07:39.733
Oh, my goodness.

07:42.843 --> 07:44.333
lt's a reunion!

07:44.411 --> 07:45.241
Group hug!

07:45.312 --> 07:47.075
Meatwad, back away.

07:47.147 --> 07:48.774
They're all zombified.

07:52.786 --> 07:54.777
When did you get a gorilla?

07:54.855 --> 07:56.720
Don't you remember
this guy?

07:56.790 --> 07:59.156
Back in '02, l got tired of
always losing them hamsters,

07:59.226 --> 08:00.386
you know, so l splurged.

08:00.460 --> 08:02.018
Get me a gorilla.

08:04.931 --> 08:06.922
Microwave...

08:08.302 --> 08:09.701
That would be classic.

08:10.971 --> 08:12.598
No!

08:12.673 --> 08:13.867
Oh, no!

08:13.940 --> 08:15.202
Ugh!

08:15.275 --> 08:17.766
The only thing l can
figure from this is that Carl's

08:17.844 --> 08:20.210
radioactive waste must have
infected the animals

08:20.280 --> 08:21.872
with some sort of zombie virus.

08:21.948 --> 08:24.473
Big Billy, is this true?

08:27.287 --> 08:28.117
Come on, boy, now.

08:28.188 --> 08:29.780
Put him down and give me a big
ol' hug.

08:29.856 --> 08:30.914
Meatwad, don't.

08:30.991 --> 08:32.116
lt's a virus.

08:34.895 --> 08:35.986
No, not this one, Meatwad.

08:36.063 --> 08:38.258
This virus can only be spread
through bodily fluids.

08:38.332 --> 08:40.061
That means blood, saliva...

08:45.572 --> 08:47.506
Big Billy, you got an STD

08:47.574 --> 08:49.303
and you wasn't gonna tell me?

08:57.484 --> 08:59.076
Hey, whoa!
Whoa!

08:59.152 --> 09:00.915
Where you going?! Get over here!

09:00.987 --> 09:03.387
Look, guys,
they're offering us free sex,

09:03.457 --> 09:06.255
and you are an idiot
to turn that down.

09:06.326 --> 09:08.089
Sex is everything to me...

09:08.161 --> 09:08.991
everything.

09:09.062 --> 09:10.324
All right, then.
Go for it.

09:10.397 --> 09:11.329
l will.

09:11.398 --> 09:15.630
But l will use protection,
'cause l am smart.

09:16.002 --> 09:18.402
Wow.
Do l have a big smile on my face?

09:18.472 --> 09:20.372
l'll never kiss and tell,

09:20.440 --> 09:22.738
but l pounded that ape... twice.

09:22.809 --> 09:24.037
Meatwad, back away.

09:24.111 --> 09:24.941
Yeah.

09:25.045 --> 09:27.445
And bow down to the king
of ape sex!

09:27.514 --> 09:30.074
Hyah!

09:30.150 --> 09:31.583
l'm sorry you had to see that,
Meatwad,

09:31.651 --> 09:33.050
but in order to kill a zombie,

09:33.120 --> 09:35.247
you have to separate
the brain from the spine.

09:35.322 --> 09:37.415
Hey, l just heard,
like, a pop.

09:37.491 --> 09:38.321
Did you hear that?

09:38.392 --> 09:39.518
damn Wikipedia!

09:39.593 --> 09:42.084
You guys got any of those brains
lying around?

09:42.162 --> 09:43.595
l just want something
to nibble on.

09:43.663 --> 09:45.426
Sure.
Just... hang on one sec.

09:45.499 --> 09:48.195
lf your friend has just been
infected with a zombie virus

09:48.268 --> 09:50.793
through sexual contact with an
undead Simian creature,

09:50.871 --> 09:51.997
please press 2.

09:52.072 --> 09:54.233
Seriously,
l need an aspirin.

09:55.242 --> 09:56.106
Okay.

09:57.077 --> 09:59.238
Tell him to stand out
in the street.

10:00.647 --> 10:03.946
And a gay zombie ape party bus
will come pick him up?

10:04.918 --> 10:06.442
All right. l'll tell him.

10:07.521 --> 10:08.954
l heard.

10:09.022 --> 10:11.013
ls that what you think of me?

10:12.926 --> 10:16.293
l can't control myself.

10:16.363 --> 10:17.261
l...

10:17.330 --> 10:19.662
l have no moral compass...

10:19.733 --> 10:21.530
'cause l wasn't raised right.

10:21.601 --> 10:26.038
But if you want to get rid of me
and my disease...

10:26.106 --> 10:31.043
And my insatiable appetite for
brains and sex with infected

10:31.111 --> 10:32.100
animals...

10:32.179 --> 10:34.739
Then just tell me where to go.

10:38.285 --> 10:39.149
Yeah.

10:39.219 --> 10:41.813
Out in the street, with the
zombie bus and the gay gorillas.

10:41.888 --> 10:43.651
Fine.

10:43.723 --> 10:45.190
Well, then go, then.

10:45.258 --> 10:47.590
l am going.

10:47.661 --> 10:48.787
l am moving.

10:48.862 --> 10:50.659
That's what l'm doing.

10:50.730 --> 10:51.697
ls that...

10:51.765 --> 10:52.595
Yes!

10:52.666 --> 10:53.963
That's my people!

10:55.202 --> 10:57.500
Let the parade begin, yo!

10:58.171 --> 10:59.536
l call first cigarette.

10:59.606 --> 11:02.074
All right.

11:02.142 --> 11:03.302
Wa... no, wait...
the gas leak!

11:04.544 --> 11:05.636
Dancing is forbidden

11:06.413 --> 11:08.278
D-d-dancing is forbidden

11:09.649 --> 11:11.048
Dancing is forbidden

11:11.918 --> 11:13.749
D-d-dancing is forbidden

11:14.988 --> 11:16.512
D-d-dancing is forbidden
