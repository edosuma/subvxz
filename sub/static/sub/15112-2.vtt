00:00.888 --> 00:02.189
<i>So tell me how this works.</i>

00:02.223 --> 00:03.974
<i>I'm awake with my
wife, then I close my eyes.</i>

00:04.008 --> 00:06.526
<i>I open them;</i>
<i>I'm awake with my son.</i>

00:06.561 --> 00:09.829
And this has been happening
since the accident?

00:11.199 --> 00:14.851
<i>So, you begin working on
one case here in reality,</i>

00:14.869 --> 00:16.820
and suddenly, you begin working
<i>another case there,</i>

00:16.854 --> 00:18.705
<i>in your dream.</i>

00:18.740 --> 00:20.974
<i>It all feels
completely real to me.</i>

00:21.009 --> 00:23.043
You can't tell whether
you're awake or asleep

00:23.077 --> 00:24.144
at this very moment.

00:24.178 --> 00:25.228
<i>Well, I can assure you,</i>

00:25.246 --> 00:27.080
Detective Britten,
this is not a dream.

00:27.115 --> 00:29.733
That's exactly what
the other shrink said.

00:32.665 --> 00:34.765
AWAKE
S01 Ep02 - The Little Guy

00:35.210 --> 00:38.710
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

00:41.579 --> 00:43.380
Did you wash these?

00:43.414 --> 00:46.082
I presume that's teenager
for "Thank you."

00:46.100 --> 00:48.018
They,

00:48.052 --> 00:49.553
They smell weird.

00:49.587 --> 00:51.188
Weird?

00:51.222 --> 00:52.472
I-I don't know.

00:52.523 --> 00:55.192
They used
to smell different.

00:55.226 --> 00:57.093
<i>It's very difficult, isn't it?</i>

00:57.111 --> 00:59.763
<i>We can't begin</i>
<i>to imagine all the...</i>

00:59.797 --> 01:02.282
the little ways
that a loss affects us

01:02.316 --> 01:05.569
until we are confronted
with it day by day.

01:06.604 --> 01:08.271
Maybe.

01:08.289 --> 01:11.541
Maybe some of those things
aren't really lost.

01:11.576 --> 01:13.960
What are you doing?

01:13.995 --> 01:15.779
What?

01:15.797 --> 01:17.748
Fabric softener.

01:17.782 --> 01:20.333
Fabric softener.

01:20.385 --> 01:22.636
<i>My God,</i>
<i>that is interesting.</i>

01:22.670 --> 01:26.223
Do you know that the exact
access to the unconscious mind

01:26.257 --> 01:27.841
that you're describing
has been sought after

01:27.892 --> 01:30.126
since the beginning
of civilization?

01:30.144 --> 01:32.896
The Greeks used to sleep

01:32.930 --> 01:34.598
in temple chambers,

01:34.632 --> 01:36.817
hoping to receive insight
from their dreams.

01:36.851 --> 01:39.152
Even philosophers
and scientists

01:39.187 --> 01:41.021
have recorded
incredible breakthroughs

01:41.072 --> 01:43.106
delivered to them while asleep.

01:43.140 --> 01:45.909
Guess I should
have been a scientist.

01:45.943 --> 01:49.129
All I do is end up working
twice as many homicides.

01:49.163 --> 01:50.614
Bernard Mackenzie?

01:50.648 --> 01:52.432
The fertility doctor, you
guys never heard of him?

01:52.467 --> 01:54.334
40-year-old marathoner,

01:54.368 --> 01:56.286
and Tuesday he drops
dead of a heart attack.

01:56.320 --> 01:57.504
Autopsy report
comes back clean,

01:57.538 --> 01:58.988
but something about
it kept bugging me.

01:59.006 --> 02:01.174
So tonight I do a
whole nother workup,

02:01.209 --> 02:02.843
and bingo, I find a reason

02:02.877 --> 02:05.462
to call my two bestest
pals over in Homicide.

02:05.496 --> 02:07.597
Potassium chloride.

02:07.632 --> 02:09.983
Shot of that will give an
Olympian a heart attack,

02:10.017 --> 02:11.885
but it's usually
not very subtle,

02:11.936 --> 02:13.520
which is where this
guy's killer gets smart.

02:13.554 --> 02:15.222
The doctor here was diabetic,

02:15.273 --> 02:17.140
so they planted the
chemical in his insulin,

02:17.174 --> 02:18.325
pushes it out
of the blood,

02:18.359 --> 02:19.810
basically makes it untraceable.

02:19.844 --> 02:21.511
Unless you're really good,

02:21.529 --> 02:22.679
which I am.

02:22.697 --> 02:24.981
So, congratulations,
gentlemen,

02:25.015 --> 02:27.851
Dr. Bernard Mackenzie's death
is now officially a murder.

02:27.869 --> 02:30.320
Sorry.

02:30.354 --> 02:32.322
I thought there was more
in the fridge.

02:32.356 --> 02:33.874
I'll get to the store
tomorrow.

02:33.908 --> 02:35.208
It's fine.

02:35.243 --> 02:36.910
You know, I can
go out, or like,

02:36.961 --> 02:38.829
eat at Cole's when
you're going to be late.

02:38.863 --> 02:40.697
His dad said it's okay.

02:40.715 --> 02:42.382
What, you don't like cereal
and soda night?

02:42.416 --> 02:44.401
I'm a step away
from giving you

02:44.435 --> 02:46.136
a bag of sugar and a spoon.

02:46.170 --> 02:51.475
I'm just saying, we don't have
to force ourselves to do this.

02:51.509 --> 02:53.477
What, eat?

02:53.511 --> 02:55.061
At the table.

02:55.096 --> 02:57.180
Together every night.

02:59.049 --> 03:00.801
You used to eat
with your mother, right?

03:00.835 --> 03:02.352
When I wasn't here?

03:02.386 --> 03:04.571
Yeah, usually.

03:04.605 --> 03:06.723
What did she have to do

03:06.741 --> 03:08.358
to convince you
to sit down with her?

03:08.392 --> 03:10.911
I don't know.

03:10.945 --> 03:14.498
I guess she cooked actual food.

03:20.505 --> 03:21.788
What's all that?

03:21.839 --> 03:23.089
Mail.

03:23.124 --> 03:24.508
Rex's.

03:24.542 --> 03:28.011
That was Cole's dad.

03:28.045 --> 03:30.430
Apparently Rex has been having
stuff shipped to their address.

03:30.464 --> 03:32.549
Look at this.

03:32.583 --> 03:34.417
Catalogs.

03:34.435 --> 03:36.853
Junk mail.

03:36.888 --> 03:39.890
This one looks like a bill.

03:39.924 --> 03:42.425
Could you pass me a knife?

03:44.061 --> 03:45.762
Why?

03:45.780 --> 03:47.230
I want to open the box,

03:47.264 --> 03:48.615
see what's inside.

03:52.403 --> 03:53.620
Can we just...

03:53.654 --> 03:55.622
Can we leave that alone?

03:55.656 --> 03:57.791
Why?

03:57.825 --> 04:00.410
Because I-I...

04:00.444 --> 04:03.129
What's the point?

04:03.164 --> 04:07.116
Well, aren't you curious
to see what it is?

04:07.134 --> 04:08.501
I mean, he's having
stuff shipped

04:08.553 --> 04:10.136
to somebody else's house.

04:10.171 --> 04:12.005
All right, fine.

04:12.056 --> 04:14.140
Can you just leave it
till I go?

04:14.175 --> 04:15.976
What's wrong?

04:16.010 --> 04:18.478
I'm not like you.

04:18.512 --> 04:21.147
Okay, I...

04:23.184 --> 04:27.487
Yesterday, I found his cleat
in the trunk of the car,

04:27.521 --> 04:31.741
and I... I remember
he'd lost it,

04:31.776 --> 04:34.494
Yeah. and he'd been
looking for it for weeks,

04:34.528 --> 04:37.831
and I found it.

04:37.865 --> 04:41.785
And I just stood there, and I...

04:41.819 --> 04:44.371
It just about put me
on the ground.

04:44.422 --> 04:45.505
So, we'll...

04:45.539 --> 04:47.123
we'll go through
his mail, I just...

04:47.157 --> 04:49.158
Shh.

04:54.832 --> 04:56.833
I'm sorry.

05:00.221 --> 05:02.505
I don't understand
how it's so easy for you.

05:05.276 --> 05:07.143
It-It's not that
it's easy for me.

05:07.177 --> 05:09.529
I just... sometimes things,

05:09.563 --> 05:12.699
they don't remind me
of him being gone,

05:12.733 --> 05:14.985
or the accident, they...

05:15.019 --> 05:17.787
they remind me of him,

05:17.822 --> 05:20.323
you know?

05:20.357 --> 05:23.043
I mean, I don't
know what's in there,

05:23.077 --> 05:27.163
but on the off chance it might
have made you think of him,

05:27.197 --> 05:31.367
in case it put a
smile on your face...

05:33.387 --> 05:35.672
I thought it was
worth opening.

05:35.706 --> 05:37.724
I'm sorry.

05:37.758 --> 05:40.343
No.

05:40.377 --> 05:43.013
It just...

05:43.047 --> 05:45.048
doesn't work like that for me.

05:53.324 --> 05:55.992
<i>Why do you think
that you and your wife</i>

05:56.027 --> 05:57.226
have such different reactions

05:57.244 --> 05:58.995
when something reminds you
of Rex?

06:03.951 --> 06:06.336
Sometimes I...

06:06.370 --> 06:07.871
Sometimes I think
she's trying to deal

06:07.905 --> 06:10.340
with the fact that he's gone
by pretending he was never here.

06:10.374 --> 06:13.677
Where as you simply
insist on pretending

06:13.711 --> 06:15.428
that he's perfectly fine.

06:15.463 --> 06:18.915
I know you want
to hold on to your son,

06:18.933 --> 06:21.601
but have you considered the
possibility that that fantasy

06:21.635 --> 06:25.722
may become incompatible
with holding on to your wife?

06:25.756 --> 06:29.059
Just because I have
a different perspective,

06:29.093 --> 06:32.762
I don't see that as a bad thing.

06:32.797 --> 06:35.264
Maybe the fact that I
see things differently

06:35.282 --> 06:37.033
allows me to know
what questions to ask,

06:37.068 --> 06:38.451
what answers to focus on.

06:38.486 --> 06:41.237
Maybe it puts me
in a better position to help.

06:46.727 --> 06:48.244
What?

06:48.278 --> 06:51.280
Number three, Bernard Mackenzie.

06:51.298 --> 06:53.299
What do you know about that?

06:53.334 --> 06:55.001
Some dead homeless guy.

06:55.052 --> 06:56.319
Why?

06:56.354 --> 06:57.804
Dr. Bernard Mackenzie's

06:57.838 --> 06:59.222
death is now
officially a murder.

06:59.256 --> 07:00.974
Let me see the file.

07:01.008 --> 07:02.926
But they worked it.
It's, you know,

07:02.960 --> 07:05.345
there's no evidence,
no leads, it's a dead end.

07:05.396 --> 07:06.796
Why are you so interested

07:06.814 --> 07:09.065
in a dead homeless guy?

07:10.101 --> 07:12.068
Just get me the file.

07:12.103 --> 07:14.070
All right.

07:14.105 --> 07:15.772
<i>I think</i>

07:15.806 --> 07:18.491
that these sorts of connections
between your worlds can be

07:18.526 --> 07:20.593
<i>incredibly beneficial,</i>
<i>and I support</i>

07:20.628 --> 07:22.062
<i>a more active connection</i>

07:22.096 --> 07:25.481
<i>between your conscious</i>
<i>and unconscious mind.</i>

07:25.499 --> 07:29.452
<i>I think it's gonna aid you</i>
<i>in uncovering and processing</i>

07:29.486 --> 07:31.671
<i>the source</i>
<i>of your emotional issues.</i>

07:33.958 --> 07:36.292
Well,

07:36.326 --> 07:38.511
would it surprise
you to hear Dr. Lee

07:38.546 --> 07:40.964
feels slightly differently?

07:40.998 --> 07:43.633
Let me be clear, Detective.

07:43.667 --> 07:47.670
Your condition is the result
of a deeply fractured psyche.

07:47.688 --> 07:49.355
<i>It is a problem.</i>

07:49.390 --> 07:53.176
<i>It is not a tool.</i>

07:53.194 --> 07:57.147
<i>Well, you can call it
whatever you like, Doctor.</i>

07:57.181 --> 08:00.183
I seem to be doing all right
with it.

08:13.651 --> 08:15.235
Mrs. Britten?

08:15.269 --> 08:16.987
Hey, Cole,

08:17.021 --> 08:19.823
Look, your dad was
having some mail,

08:19.857 --> 08:21.925
dropped off that I guess Rex
was having delivered here?

08:21.959 --> 08:24.511
Yeah, yeah, right, I...

08:25.563 --> 08:28.448
Well, anyway,
I opened this one and...

08:28.499 --> 08:31.918
I was just wondering if you
could tell me what that is?

08:32.953 --> 08:35.672
Yeah, that's,

08:35.706 --> 08:36.990
It's a camshaft.

08:38.042 --> 08:40.777
Okay, uh, so new question.

08:40.794 --> 08:43.129
I was wondering
if you can tell me

08:43.164 --> 08:46.916
maybe why he had a camshaft
delivered to your house?

08:46.950 --> 08:50.286
Right, yeah,

08:52.089 --> 08:54.090
Come with me.

09:02.466 --> 09:05.852
We, uh, had been working on
it for the past nine months.

09:05.903 --> 09:07.970
Every time we said we
were going to the beach,

09:07.988 --> 09:12.742
we actually came here.

09:12.777 --> 09:14.778
You guys bought this?

09:14.812 --> 09:16.279
I-I know you guys had

09:16.313 --> 09:17.530
said no to him,

09:17.581 --> 09:19.165
and my parents
said the same thing.

09:19.200 --> 09:20.333
It was...

09:20.367 --> 09:23.286
It was really all my idea.

09:23.320 --> 09:26.456
Look, if it makes
you feel any better,

09:26.490 --> 09:28.658
no one ever rode it.

09:28.676 --> 09:31.694
It wasn't finished
when Rex,

09:35.499 --> 09:39.502
After that, I didn't really feel
like working on it, you know?

09:47.027 --> 09:48.445
What's this?

09:48.479 --> 09:51.514
That's a feeler gauge.

09:51.532 --> 09:54.517
It-it like changes
the distance between the,

09:54.535 --> 09:57.320
rocker arm
and the valve stems.

09:57.354 --> 09:59.122
To be honest,
Rex was kind of the one

09:59.156 --> 10:00.790
that figured all this stuff out.

10:06.864 --> 10:09.182
You should finish it.

10:12.136 --> 10:14.137
Rex would have wanted you to.

10:23.564 --> 10:25.515
This is a total
waste of time.

10:25.549 --> 10:27.317
They canvassed the
neighborhood a month ago.

10:27.351 --> 10:28.818
You think it's gotten
more likely they're gonna

10:28.853 --> 10:30.820
know anything about a dead
homeless junkie now?

10:30.855 --> 10:33.656
There's only one way
to find out.

10:35.025 --> 10:38.328
Did you even look
at this guy's file?

10:38.362 --> 10:41.514
Bernard Mackenzie... four arrests
for assault and battery,

10:41.549 --> 10:44.450
two for armed robbery, 11
for possession of narcotics.

10:44.502 --> 10:47.871
Now, this is the guy whose murder you
suddenly feel compelled to solve?

10:47.905 --> 10:49.422
We don't pick
the victims, Vega.

10:49.456 --> 10:52.258
- It's our job to clear the cases.
- Don't give me that.

10:52.293 --> 10:54.594
This <i>wasn't</i> our case, and
you <i>did</i> pick this victim.

10:54.628 --> 10:56.930
So if you're gonna drag
me all over the city

10:56.964 --> 10:59.265
trying to dig him up,
the least you can do

10:59.300 --> 11:01.134
is tell me why this
is so important.

11:01.185 --> 11:03.019
Who the hell is
Bernard Mackenzie to you?

11:03.053 --> 11:05.638
- You want to know the truth?
- Yes, I want to know the truth.

11:05.689 --> 11:07.477
I don't have to explain
myself to you.

11:07.478 --> 11:07.924
What?

11:07.942 --> 11:09.726
I've been doing
this job long enough

11:09.760 --> 11:12.428
that if I tell you some homeless
guy's death is important,

11:12.446 --> 11:15.198
as far as you're concerned,
it's a Kennedy assassination.

11:15.232 --> 11:16.649
If you have trouble
understanding that,

11:16.700 --> 11:18.568
you're gonna work me
instead of the case all day,

11:18.602 --> 11:20.453
why don't you catch a cab
back to the office,

11:20.487 --> 11:22.488
go do some paperwork,
and I'll go be detective.

11:22.540 --> 11:24.541
All right?

12:02.245 --> 12:03.246
Sir!

12:03.280 --> 12:04.337
Sir, excuse me. LAPD.

12:04.338 --> 12:06.249
Look, I'm a busy man, I'm very busy.

12:06.283 --> 12:07.700
I understand that.

12:07.751 --> 12:10.987
You know why we're
here, don't you?

12:11.005 --> 12:13.656
You got any gum?

12:22.800 --> 12:24.834
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, I saw that.

12:24.868 --> 12:26.836
I saw that a
hundred percent.

12:26.870 --> 12:28.504
A hundred and
ten percent.

12:28.522 --> 12:31.057
It was, like, this guy,
you know, he went boom!

12:31.108 --> 12:34.143
You know, and, like, the other
guy, you know, like, dead!

12:34.177 --> 12:35.395
Where was this?

12:35.446 --> 12:37.146
Right down there.

12:37.180 --> 12:39.399
Right down there
where down there is.

12:39.450 --> 12:41.451
Can you tell us
what happened, exactly?

12:41.485 --> 12:43.236
H-He was a little guy.

12:43.270 --> 12:44.954
The little guy shot him.

12:44.989 --> 12:46.906
He just went boom!

12:46.957 --> 12:48.041
Shot him.

12:48.075 --> 12:49.459
Mean little guy.

12:49.493 --> 12:51.193
What'd he look like,
this little guy?

12:51.211 --> 12:52.528
He was a little man.

12:52.546 --> 12:55.682
I don't know,
I-I-I didn't get that close.

12:55.716 --> 12:57.500
I-I can't.

12:57.534 --> 13:00.169
You-you see that house?

13:00.203 --> 13:01.804
The yellow one?

13:01.839 --> 13:05.008
That's where
they keep the antennas.

13:05.042 --> 13:07.543
And when
they broadcast,

13:07.561 --> 13:10.013
they-they tell you
all kind of crazy stuff.

13:10.047 --> 13:11.814
I stay awake.

13:11.849 --> 13:14.050
That's how
I stay out of trouble.

13:14.068 --> 13:15.818
The broadcasts.

13:18.572 --> 13:20.723
Well, thank you.

13:20.741 --> 13:24.560
If we have any more questions,
we'll beam you up.

13:24.578 --> 13:25.828
Thank you for your time.

13:25.863 --> 13:27.363
If we need you, we'll find you.

13:31.168 --> 13:33.569
You have to be
kidding me.

13:33.587 --> 13:36.289
That's your witness?

13:36.340 --> 13:38.574
The guy doesn't even know
what planet he's on, man.

13:38.592 --> 13:39.876
He thinks gum is money.

13:39.910 --> 13:41.511
Doesn't mean he
didn't see anything.

13:41.545 --> 13:43.746
Can we go now?

13:48.752 --> 13:50.386
Wait, that's the guy?

13:50.420 --> 13:51.754
That's the guy

13:51.772 --> 13:53.356
you like for the
Mackenzie murder?

13:53.390 --> 13:55.424
Yeah. Why?

13:55.442 --> 13:57.410
Well, you didn't tell
me he was, like, ten feet tall.

13:58.696 --> 14:01.030
That matter
for some reason?

14:01.065 --> 14:02.732
No.

14:02.766 --> 14:05.434
I'll lead; you close.

14:09.606 --> 14:11.407
This is ridiculous.

14:11.441 --> 14:13.910
Then help me to see
what I'm missing, Dr. Taylor.

14:13.944 --> 14:16.379
Did you threaten to kill Dr.
Mackenzie in front of his wife?

14:16.413 --> 14:19.999
We were arguing, I was venting...
obviously, I didn't mean it.

14:20.050 --> 14:23.419
Look, the people you should be talking
to are those religious groups

14:23.453 --> 14:25.421
that send us threatening
e-mail all the time.

14:25.455 --> 14:27.640
I've got a whole folder
full of death threats

14:27.674 --> 14:28.841
for me <i>and</i> Mackenzie.

14:28.892 --> 14:30.760
Well, was it you
or a religious group

14:30.794 --> 14:32.645
that got into an altercation
with the victim

14:32.679 --> 14:34.463
two days before
he was found dead.

14:34.481 --> 14:37.350
I was simply trying
to clean out my office.

14:37.401 --> 14:38.105
He accosted me.

14:38.106 --> 14:39.936
And the office you were cleaning out,

14:39.970 --> 14:42.822
that's the one you lost in the
lawsuit over the practice?

14:42.856 --> 14:44.974
A practice worth millions
of dollars a year?

14:44.992 --> 14:46.776
I didn't care about that.

14:46.810 --> 14:47.827
Really?

14:47.861 --> 14:49.746
Mackenzie's the one
who decided that

14:49.780 --> 14:50.980
we could start
printing money

14:50.998 --> 14:54.033
if we just took on
a wealthier crowd.

14:54.084 --> 14:56.318
And, then, so he started
turning away the people

14:56.336 --> 14:59.338
who really do need our help,
because they're tough cases...

14:59.373 --> 15:00.990
affects our stats.

15:01.008 --> 15:03.459
See, the kind of patients
that Mackenzie wants,

15:03.493 --> 15:06.262
they need see
you've got perfect stats.

15:06.296 --> 15:08.497
So after a while I'd had enough.

15:08.515 --> 15:10.633
And yes, when the contracts
were all settled,

15:10.667 --> 15:12.618
it turns out
he figured out a way

15:12.653 --> 15:14.620
to screw me
out of my own practice.

15:14.655 --> 15:17.774
But Mackenzie was the one
who'd kill for another dollar.

15:17.808 --> 15:19.508
I just wanted out.

15:19.526 --> 15:21.144
Whatever happened,

15:21.178 --> 15:23.329
it had nothing
to do with me.

15:23.363 --> 15:24.764
Because you were
at home that night

15:24.798 --> 15:26.299
watching television,
by yourself,

15:26.333 --> 15:28.301
while your wife,
your kids,

15:28.335 --> 15:30.453
anybody who could
corroborate your story,

15:30.487 --> 15:32.455
was conveniently out.

15:32.489 --> 15:35.158
Do I have it right
so far, Doctor?

15:43.250 --> 15:45.435
How tall are you?

15:46.703 --> 15:48.604
Six, 11. Why?

15:50.207 --> 15:52.658
It was the little guy.
Definitely.

15:54.311 --> 15:55.645
Lawyer's here.

15:55.679 --> 15:56.813
Okay.

15:56.847 --> 15:58.147
Don't say a word.

15:58.182 --> 16:00.566
But I didn't do...
Let me handle this.

16:00.601 --> 16:03.436
My client has nothing
to say at this time.

16:03.487 --> 16:05.321
If you want to speak
further to him,

16:05.355 --> 16:06.722
you can charge him
with something.

16:06.740 --> 16:08.390
Otherwise, it's time
to let him go.

16:08.408 --> 16:09.558
Let him go?

16:09.576 --> 16:11.777
Your client made public
threats and got into

16:11.829 --> 16:14.330
a fistfight with a man who
cost him millions of dollars.

16:14.364 --> 16:16.516
That man ended up dead
two days later.

16:16.550 --> 16:18.651
Your client not
only has no alibi,

16:18.685 --> 16:21.337
he had access to the office, knew
that the victim was a diabetic,

16:21.371 --> 16:23.506
and being a doctor,
knew exactly

16:23.540 --> 16:27.409
how to kill somebody and make it
look like a heart attack.

16:27.427 --> 16:29.712
Your client
isn't going anywhere.

16:29.746 --> 16:31.681
Then we're done talking.

16:33.217 --> 16:35.184
What were you watching?

16:35.219 --> 16:36.207
Don't answer that.

16:36.208 --> 16:38.404
You said you were
watching television.

16:38.438 --> 16:39.889
What were you watching?

16:41.258 --> 16:43.893
I can't help
you if you don't talk.

16:43.927 --> 16:46.562
It's an innocent question;
you're saying you're innocent.

16:46.596 --> 16:49.431
I don't see what
the problem is.

16:49.449 --> 16:51.400
What were you watching?

16:55.572 --> 16:58.374
Sunday night, I was
watching the football game.

17:01.912 --> 17:05.615
Office security said that the lights
were tripped in the kitchen area

17:05.648 --> 17:08.117
where Mackenzie kept the
insulin at around 9:00 p.m.

17:08.151 --> 17:09.451
That would've been...

17:09.469 --> 17:10.786
the third quarter.

17:10.804 --> 17:12.021
Remember anything
about the third quarter?

17:12.055 --> 17:14.640
Arthur, I'd advise you
not to say anything else

17:14.675 --> 17:16.608
until we've had
a chance to speak.

17:16.643 --> 17:18.060
- Who was winning?
- Arthur.

17:18.095 --> 17:19.929
The Steelers.

17:19.963 --> 17:22.598
- They'd just scored.
- Which you could've found out

17:22.633 --> 17:24.133
by looking at a newspaper.

17:24.166 --> 17:26.068
You remember anything...

17:26.103 --> 17:27.904
the commentator said,
anything specific?

17:31.474 --> 17:33.743
I remember something
about the defense.

17:33.777 --> 17:36.279
How the team
was so banged up,

17:36.313 --> 17:38.581
the one commentator said
that they'd ask <i>him</i> to play.

17:38.615 --> 17:40.149
Something like that.

17:40.167 --> 17:41.250
Is that right?

17:42.619 --> 17:46.038
Let's find out.

17:46.089 --> 17:48.374
<i>They're not
gonna get anywhere on the field.</i>

17:48.408 --> 17:49.825
<i>They've got
so many people injured,</i>

17:49.860 --> 17:51.944
<i>I think even I'm
in their dime package.</i>

17:51.979 --> 17:53.379
<i>You can see the defen...</i>

17:56.516 --> 17:59.101
All right, so Taylor
either saw the game,

17:59.136 --> 18:01.938
or... made a tape and
memorized the commentary.

18:01.972 --> 18:05.258
Since he didn't think he had an
alibi, I'm saying he saw the game.

18:06.727 --> 18:08.561
He's not the guy.

18:08.612 --> 18:10.179
That's quite a catch.

18:10.197 --> 18:11.864
You don't pull that
out of your hat

18:11.898 --> 18:13.816
and Taylor's in a cell
waiting for a bail hearing.

18:13.850 --> 18:15.701
Just trying to see it
from all the angles.

18:15.736 --> 18:19.572
No. I saw it on your face the
minute he walked in the room.

18:19.623 --> 18:22.792
Lot of evidence against him,
but you didn't like him for it.

18:22.826 --> 18:25.194
Mind telling me what
you saw that I didn't?

18:25.212 --> 18:27.630
I don't know, s...

18:27.664 --> 18:29.782
something felt off.

18:29.816 --> 18:32.001
And you asking him
about his height,

18:32.035 --> 18:34.503
was that just part
of what felt off to you?

18:36.306 --> 18:37.823
Intuition.

18:37.858 --> 18:39.642
Okay.

18:39.676 --> 18:41.177
So where does that leave us?

18:41.211 --> 18:43.012
Well, he said they
had death threats.

18:43.046 --> 18:47.149
What do you say we pull all their
computers and see what we come up with?

18:47.184 --> 18:48.567
And what's your intuition
telling you

18:48.602 --> 18:49.986
about going down that road?

18:50.020 --> 18:54.156
If I hear from it, you will be
the first person to know.

19:04.559 --> 19:06.059
Hey. Anything?

19:06.093 --> 19:07.194
Yeah.

19:07.228 --> 19:09.029
Threatening e-mails
were standard issue,

19:09.063 --> 19:11.431
but our technical guys went through
the clinic's computer system

19:11.449 --> 19:13.150
and found out it
had been hacked.

19:13.201 --> 19:15.652
Somebody had installed a backdoor
to all the clinic's records,

19:15.703 --> 19:17.488
and within hours of
the doctor's murder

19:17.539 --> 19:19.156
about 20 of those
records disappeared.

19:19.207 --> 19:21.325
Can we track this
hacking somebody down?

19:21.376 --> 19:22.876
Let's ask Nat.

19:22.911 --> 19:25.045
I.P. address belongs
to Laura Harvison.

19:25.079 --> 19:26.797
Her records are among
the ones deleted

19:26.831 --> 19:28.332
within hours
after the murder.

19:28.383 --> 19:29.800
I looked her up.

19:29.834 --> 19:33.187
Paralegal who barely knows how
to use her own Facebook page.

19:33.221 --> 19:35.005
It's really unlikely
she pulled this off.

19:35.056 --> 19:36.140
Right. So who did?

19:36.174 --> 19:38.225
She's got a
17-year-old son.

19:38.259 --> 19:39.760
More likely that's
your hacker.

19:39.794 --> 19:42.179
All right. And, uh,
what about the deleted records?

19:42.230 --> 19:44.631
Trying to retrieve copies
from an off-site backup, but...

19:44.649 --> 19:46.183
it's gonna
take some time.

19:46.234 --> 19:48.435
You got a name
for this 17-year-old kid?

19:48.469 --> 19:50.971
Sam. Sam Harvison.

19:50.989 --> 19:54.691
All right. Let's go see if we can
pull Sammy away from the keyboard

19:54.742 --> 19:56.276
long enough
to have a chat.

19:56.310 --> 19:58.478
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

19:58.496 --> 20:01.114
Just...

20:01.148 --> 20:03.984
please, just...
don't tell my mom.

20:05.420 --> 20:07.153
Why don't you
walk us through

20:07.172 --> 20:08.822
what happened.

20:08.840 --> 20:12.492
I was only trying
to find my own file.

20:12.510 --> 20:15.161
But once I was in,
I accidentally altered

20:15.180 --> 20:17.097
some of the others.

20:17.131 --> 20:19.016
I didn't mean to... it was
stupid... but then every time

20:19.050 --> 20:21.101
I tried to fix it, I ended
up just making it worse.

20:21.135 --> 20:22.219
I didn't know what to do.

20:22.270 --> 20:23.554
Why so interested in your file?

20:27.942 --> 20:29.309
My dad...

20:29.343 --> 20:31.645
he found out that he had cancer,

20:31.679 --> 20:33.013
like, a few months

20:33.031 --> 20:35.382
after he
married my mom.

20:35.416 --> 20:37.517
He...

20:37.535 --> 20:39.519
donated the-the...

20:39.537 --> 20:43.240
sperm that they used to make me
before he started his treatment.

20:43.291 --> 20:46.410
And then... by the time
that Dr. Mackenzie

20:46.461 --> 20:48.795
got my mom pregnant...

20:48.830 --> 20:50.797
he wasn't doing well.

20:50.832 --> 20:54.668
And he died a few months
after I was born.

20:54.702 --> 20:57.087
I just wanted to...
know my dad.

20:57.121 --> 20:58.222
I never knew him.

20:58.256 --> 21:00.807
I've tried to
find out about him.

21:00.842 --> 21:02.593
This just seemed like
the easiest way to get ahold

21:02.644 --> 21:03.677
of his medical records,
you know.

21:03.711 --> 21:06.013
Why not just ask your mom?

21:06.047 --> 21:09.650
My mom...

21:09.684 --> 21:12.019
I'm, like, the last
remaining bit of my dad.

21:12.053 --> 21:15.388
I'm, like, this reminder
of the man that she loved.

21:15.406 --> 21:17.691
So it just seemed easier to get
the information myself.

21:17.725 --> 21:19.059
At least,
I thought it was.

21:19.077 --> 21:20.410
I wasn't trying
to mess anything up.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.246
I swear to you.

21:24.198 --> 21:27.601
Where were you on Sunday...
Sunday night, about 9:00 p.m.?

21:27.635 --> 21:29.720
Sunday?

21:29.754 --> 21:31.338
I was at a movie.

21:31.372 --> 21:35.726
MmWere you with anyone? No.

21:37.762 --> 21:40.514
But I might still have
the ticket,

21:40.548 --> 21:41.932
if my mom hasn't
thrown it out.

21:47.689 --> 21:51.057
Yes... There it is.

21:51.075 --> 21:54.411
- Does-does that help?
- Can I keep this?

21:54.445 --> 21:56.580
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

21:56.614 --> 21:58.231
Thank you.

21:58.249 --> 22:00.167
We'll let you know if we
have any other questions.

22:03.788 --> 22:05.756
How tall are you, Sam?

22:07.292 --> 22:08.908
Five, five.

22:08.926 --> 22:11.178
Why?

22:17.302 --> 22:19.919
What's going
on with you?

22:19.937 --> 22:22.422
When did this case become
about how tall everybody is?

22:22.440 --> 22:24.808
It's kinda hard
to explain.

22:24.859 --> 22:26.360
Try me.

22:26.394 --> 22:27.978
Well, it's just a theory.

22:28.029 --> 22:29.696
I spoke to
the alarm company.

22:29.731 --> 22:31.031
They said there's
a little window

22:31.065 --> 22:33.734
in the doctor's office
with a broken contact

22:33.768 --> 22:36.253
that they didn't bothered to fix
because they didn't think

22:36.287 --> 22:37.988
anybody could fit
through there.

22:38.039 --> 22:39.272
Okay.

22:39.290 --> 22:42.242
Well, I figure somebody got
through there,

22:42.276 --> 22:43.627
fixed the doctor's insulin,

22:43.661 --> 22:45.545
slipped out again
without leaving a trace.

22:45.580 --> 22:48.498
You just said it's too small
for anybody to fit through.

22:48.549 --> 22:50.050
No. I said
they said that.

22:50.084 --> 22:51.885
Somebody small could
fit through there,

22:51.919 --> 22:53.953
somebody like Sam Harvison
could fit through there.

22:53.971 --> 22:57.424
So instead of worrying about
the people who work there,

22:57.458 --> 22:59.276
the people who walk right
through the front door,

22:59.310 --> 23:02.512
you want to focus on people
who can fit through a window?

23:02.513 --> 23:03.313
Why?

23:03.348 --> 23:05.315
Well, we don't have any motive
for people who worked there.

23:05.350 --> 23:06.633
And what you got for window boy?

23:06.651 --> 23:08.685
Nothing... yet.

23:08.736 --> 23:10.970
They're working on
the records he deleted.

23:10.988 --> 23:12.138
Maybe there's something
in there.

23:12.156 --> 23:14.140
So you're waiting for evidence

23:14.158 --> 23:16.109
to point at something
you've already decided

23:16.143 --> 23:18.812
instead of deciding anything
based on the evidence?

23:18.830 --> 23:20.364
This is not how
you work a case, Mike.

23:20.415 --> 23:22.499
I mean, this kid owes
his life to Dr. Mackenzie.

23:22.533 --> 23:24.984
Without him,
there is no Sam Harvison.

23:25.002 --> 23:27.454
That's not just no motive,
that's like an anti-motive.

23:27.488 --> 23:29.956
And what does any of this
have to do with being able

23:29.990 --> 23:31.625
- to fit through a window?
- I don't know.

23:31.659 --> 23:34.711
Like I said, just a theory.

23:52.139 --> 23:53.422
We're going to the beach.
Be back later.

23:53.440 --> 23:54.974
The beach?
What are you talking about?

23:55.025 --> 23:56.091
We're supposed
to have dinner.

23:56.109 --> 23:57.610
Cooked up a fajita feast.

23:59.146 --> 24:01.364
Come on, sit down.

24:01.398 --> 24:03.816
Get it while it's hot.

24:03.850 --> 24:05.951
Cole and I already made plans.

24:05.986 --> 24:08.337
Well, we made plans last night.

24:08.372 --> 24:09.739
And, Cole, no offense,

24:09.773 --> 24:11.407
but you look like you
need fattening up.

24:11.441 --> 24:13.409
Come sit down.

24:14.461 --> 24:18.447
I just want to hang out
with my friends.

24:20.584 --> 24:22.168
You know,
I went to a lot of trouble here.

24:22.219 --> 24:25.921
And it smells good, doesn't it?

24:25.955 --> 24:27.239
- Come on, you know you want some.
- Yeah, yeah.

24:27.274 --> 24:28.957
Save me some.

24:28.975 --> 24:30.125
You be back at 11:00.

24:30.143 --> 24:31.960
You call me at 10:00.

24:35.131 --> 24:37.650
Bye, Mr. Britten...

24:43.640 --> 24:44.857
It's Coachella, man.

24:44.908 --> 24:47.193
It's, like, three days
of amazing bands.

24:47.244 --> 24:50.663
We take the bike out, camp,
it'll be awesome.

24:50.697 --> 24:52.615
You said it was slipping
in first, right?

24:52.649 --> 24:54.350
And third to fourth.

24:54.384 --> 24:56.669
So, uh, what do you think?

24:56.703 --> 24:58.120
We're gonna have a hard
time explaining

24:58.154 --> 24:59.839
why we disappear
for three days.

24:59.873 --> 25:01.424
Well, we'll make something up.

25:01.458 --> 25:05.878
Like, a field trip, or-or like
a college visit or something.

25:05.929 --> 25:08.013
My dad doesn't have any idea
about that stuff.

25:08.048 --> 25:09.348
Yeah, dude, he's a detective.

25:09.382 --> 25:10.833
Okay. I think he's gonna
figure it out.

25:10.851 --> 25:13.836
Hasn't figured this out, has he?

25:15.856 --> 25:18.307
I... I guess not, I just...

25:18.341 --> 25:19.525
I don't know.

25:19.559 --> 25:20.843
I mean, since when
have you been so interested

25:20.861 --> 25:23.345
in, like, being smooshed
together with thousands

25:23.363 --> 25:26.398
of people
in hundred-degree heat? It's...

25:26.450 --> 25:29.685
It's just a cool thing.

25:29.703 --> 25:31.654
- Sorry I tried to include you.
- Okay.

25:31.688 --> 25:33.739
Well, then, like,
what if we say that...

25:33.790 --> 25:35.040
Hey.

25:35.075 --> 25:37.359
Hey.

25:39.179 --> 25:40.996
Do you want to walk?

25:41.030 --> 25:43.415
I'll be back.

25:43.467 --> 25:44.583
Dude, I thought we were gonna...

25:44.634 --> 25:45.751
I won't be long.

25:45.802 --> 25:47.703
Hey, Emma.

25:47.737 --> 25:49.088
Yeah?

25:49.139 --> 25:52.591
You wouldn't happen to be going
to Coachella, would you?

25:52.642 --> 25:55.895
Yeah. Why?

25:56.930 --> 25:58.731
No reason.

26:08.558 --> 26:10.526
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:10.560 --> 26:11.610
- Morning.
- Morning.

26:11.661 --> 26:13.579
- I'm sorry, I gotta run.
- Yeah.

26:13.613 --> 26:14.747
I got coffee on for you.

26:14.781 --> 26:16.732
Hey, I wanted to say something
to you last night,

26:16.750 --> 26:18.450
but you got in so late, I...

26:18.502 --> 26:20.419
I went through that mail.

26:22.455 --> 26:23.839
And?

26:23.874 --> 26:25.925
It was good.

26:25.959 --> 26:28.744
That box was a part
for a motorcycle...

26:28.762 --> 26:31.380
Rex and Cole
were rebuilding.

26:31.414 --> 26:33.415
What?

26:33.433 --> 26:34.583
Yeah.

26:34.601 --> 26:36.051
Apparently, every time
they went to the beach,

26:36.085 --> 26:37.636
that's where they went,
to work on it.

26:37.687 --> 26:40.306
The beach.

26:40.357 --> 26:41.774
I'm telling you.

26:41.808 --> 26:43.726
You should see this thing,
it's amazing.

26:43.760 --> 26:45.895
I mean, I didn't even know Rex
could change batteries,

26:45.929 --> 26:48.030
let alone
do anything mechanical.

26:48.064 --> 26:50.115
Didn't we tell him clearly
no motorcycle?

26:50.150 --> 26:54.603
But I-I... he wanted it,
so he found a way.

26:54.621 --> 26:56.238
Sound like anyone you know?

26:58.241 --> 27:00.960
Anyway, I wanted
to thank you.

27:00.994 --> 27:02.211
For what?

27:02.245 --> 27:04.880
You were right.

27:04.915 --> 27:06.949
Yeah, I-I...

27:06.967 --> 27:08.801
When I saw that motorcycle,

27:08.835 --> 27:11.921
or when I saw this thing
that Rex was just

27:11.955 --> 27:13.722
pouring himself into,
and-and I didn't

27:13.757 --> 27:18.177
even know about it,
something about it just felt...

27:18.211 --> 27:19.728
weirdly alive.

27:20.931 --> 27:23.649
You know, and I wasn't
standing there sobbing.

27:23.683 --> 27:25.651
I was... I felt proud.

27:27.687 --> 27:29.655
Yeah, it was just nice
to think about Rex

27:29.689 --> 27:32.775
and feel something
other than devastated.

27:32.809 --> 27:34.076
That's great.

27:36.112 --> 27:38.297
So, I'm gonna take
Cole down to the shop,

27:38.331 --> 27:40.583
get some last parts and...

27:40.617 --> 27:42.418
You should come by,
check it out.

27:42.452 --> 27:46.205
Yeah, well, I'd love to.

27:46.256 --> 27:47.840
All right.

27:49.793 --> 27:50.843
The beach.

27:55.148 --> 27:56.298
You gonna be late?

27:56.332 --> 27:58.634
I don't know.

27:58.668 --> 28:01.003
I'm kinda caught up
on one at the moment.

28:01.021 --> 28:02.170
I love you.

28:02.188 --> 28:03.305
Love you.

28:11.231 --> 28:14.033
Hey.

28:14.067 --> 28:16.068
We got a fresh one.

28:16.119 --> 28:17.519
Stabbing victim
on Grand.

28:17.537 --> 28:19.354
They're waiting on us.
Roll it to DaSilva.

28:19.372 --> 28:20.990
We're on one.
We're not on anything.

28:21.024 --> 28:22.958
We're looking at pictures
of short people.

28:22.993 --> 28:24.543
This is insane.

28:24.577 --> 28:26.028
We're up.
This is our case.

28:26.046 --> 28:27.579
Let's go.

28:27.631 --> 28:29.665
- Detective Britten?
- Hey.

28:29.699 --> 28:31.383
Why don't you guys
head over to Observation One.

28:31.418 --> 28:32.468
I'll be there in a minute.

28:32.502 --> 28:34.470
Could-could I maybe
get a sandwich?

28:34.504 --> 28:35.638
Sure.

28:35.672 --> 28:37.539
Get him a sandwich.

28:39.559 --> 28:41.844
You have to be kidding me.

28:41.878 --> 28:44.013
I already told you,
if you don't want to work it,

28:44.047 --> 28:46.348
go read a comic book,
just stay out of my way.

28:46.382 --> 28:48.050
There's nothing to work on.

28:48.068 --> 28:50.385
And I'm not the one in the way,
you are.

28:50.403 --> 28:52.021
I just told you
we're up.

28:52.055 --> 28:53.656
We have a real case,
with a body on the ground,

28:53.690 --> 28:55.557
and you want to have lunch
with a homeless guy?

28:55.575 --> 28:56.608
We're not up.

28:56.660 --> 28:57.693
It's DaSilva's.

28:57.727 --> 28:59.094
It's ours.

28:59.129 --> 29:00.562
I didn't work
my ass off

29:00.580 --> 29:03.365
to get promoted just so you can
start hanging stuff on me

29:03.399 --> 29:05.233
that is never
going to close.

29:05.251 --> 29:06.552
You are nowhere
on this.

29:06.586 --> 29:08.570
- There's nowhere to go.
- Since you bring it up,

29:08.588 --> 29:09.588
why don't we take a minute
to remember

29:09.622 --> 29:11.423
why you did get promoted,

29:11.458 --> 29:14.259
It wasn't just to close cases
or not close cases, was it?

29:14.294 --> 29:17.513
It was to watch over me,
so they could have someone

29:17.547 --> 29:18.597
who would tell them anything
they wanted to know.

29:18.631 --> 29:20.749
Someone who was so happy
to get his badge,

29:20.767 --> 29:23.585
he's got no problem with spying
on his fellow officers.

29:23.603 --> 29:25.387
- Hey, screw you.
- Excuse me if I don't feel obligated

29:25.421 --> 29:27.272
- I killed myself for ten years.
- to tell you everything I'm thinking

29:27.307 --> 29:28.757
when I know you're just gonna go
running to mama.

29:28.775 --> 29:30.059
- Britten, what...
- Hey!

29:30.093 --> 29:31.760
Britten.

29:31.778 --> 29:33.362
Get in here.

29:42.772 --> 29:44.206
What's going
on with you?

29:44.240 --> 29:45.574
I'm just trying to make
some headway, and I got...

29:45.608 --> 29:47.776
Sit down.

29:49.963 --> 29:51.113
You wanted to come back.

29:51.131 --> 29:53.415
This is the way it
has to be. Period.

29:53.449 --> 29:55.918
Right? You don't like Vega,
you don't like your therapy,

29:55.952 --> 29:57.886
then my offer
still stands.

29:57.921 --> 30:00.622
What... to retire?
That's ridiculous.

30:00.640 --> 30:01.957
No one is...
not saying retire.

30:01.975 --> 30:03.976
I'm saying... listen to me.

30:04.010 --> 30:07.096
You just experienced
a horrific tragedy.

30:07.130 --> 30:11.400
So instead of spending your
days and nights knee-deep

30:11.434 --> 30:12.935
in everybody
else's tragedies,

30:12.969 --> 30:15.604
why don't you let me
put you somewhere

30:15.638 --> 30:17.672
that let's you do
what's important to you,

30:17.690 --> 30:20.509
that let's you be
there for your wife,

30:20.527 --> 30:22.444
that lets you guys rebuild.

30:22.479 --> 30:23.312
Look, I'm fine.

30:23.346 --> 30:24.563
Okay. You want to be out there,

30:24.614 --> 30:26.148
then be out there.

30:26.182 --> 30:30.369
But put this Mackenzie thing
aside, and go take this case.

30:30.403 --> 30:31.820
Can you do that?

30:33.323 --> 30:34.540
Can you?

30:34.574 --> 30:37.025
Yes, yes.

30:37.043 --> 30:39.161
Good.

30:41.748 --> 30:43.499
Hey, why are you pulling

30:43.533 --> 30:46.034
all these mug shots
of short people anyway?

30:46.052 --> 30:49.171
'Cause the witness
saw a little guy.

30:49.205 --> 30:52.891
The homeless guy
who hears voices?

30:52.926 --> 30:54.977
I mean the witness.

30:55.011 --> 30:59.148
All right, give him his
sandwich, get him out of here.

31:06.239 --> 31:09.558
Harvison deleted these records
from the doctor's system

31:09.576 --> 31:11.193
shortly after the murder.

31:11.227 --> 31:13.112
It could be a dead end,
it's probably nothing,

31:13.163 --> 31:15.831
but, uh, none of us know
how to read this stuff.

31:15.865 --> 31:18.200
Just want to make sure
I'm not missing something.

31:18.234 --> 31:19.835
Really appreciate
you taking a look.

31:19.869 --> 31:21.453
No problem.
Let's take a look.

31:23.456 --> 31:25.240
Yeah, looks like
standard stuff.

31:25.258 --> 31:28.710
Prenatal labs,
genetic panels.

31:28.744 --> 31:31.430
These...

31:33.917 --> 31:35.517
What?

31:38.087 --> 31:40.055
It's impossible.

31:40.089 --> 31:42.558
Doc? What do you got?

31:42.592 --> 31:44.393
They're all related.

31:46.429 --> 31:50.432
Yeah, the markers on these
genetic panels are all the same.

31:50.450 --> 31:51.733
What are you saying?

31:51.767 --> 31:54.069
How could
that happen?

31:54.103 --> 31:55.270
Mackenzie.

31:57.540 --> 32:00.909
Mackenzie substituted
his own sperm.

32:04.297 --> 32:06.665
There's a lot of kids out there
who don't know who their dad is.

32:08.718 --> 32:10.886
Think I met
one who does.

32:18.955 --> 32:20.255
Ordered on-line,

32:20.829 --> 32:23.240
but the theater shows
it was never scanned.

32:30.032 --> 32:32.700
You ordered potassium chloride
from a Canadian pharmacy

32:32.735 --> 32:35.453
over a month ago.

32:35.487 --> 32:37.154
Sam?

32:37.172 --> 32:39.424
Techs have just started
digging into your computer,

32:39.458 --> 32:41.793
but they, uh, they've
already found searches for

32:41.827 --> 32:45.630
"induced heart attack,"
"diabetes," "insulin."

32:47.332 --> 32:48.666
We know.

33:06.518 --> 33:08.986
Do you have to tell people
what he was doing?

33:09.020 --> 33:11.355
It'll come out, eventually.

33:14.877 --> 33:16.744
When did you find out?

33:16.795 --> 33:18.796
AP Anatomy.

33:22.033 --> 33:24.552
We were doing these advanced
genetic panels as a project,

33:24.586 --> 33:28.322
and I didn't understand all
the complicated stuff at first,

33:28.357 --> 33:33.043
but... I understood one...

33:33.061 --> 33:34.862
simple thing.

33:34.897 --> 33:38.116
My blood type was wrong.

33:38.150 --> 33:41.836
You know, like,
incompatible with my parents.

33:41.870 --> 33:45.273
And I wanted to talk
to my mom, I did,

33:45.324 --> 33:48.326
but I didn't want
to freak her out.

33:50.896 --> 33:52.864
I don't know.
It just kept bothering me.

33:52.898 --> 33:55.116
Is that when you hacked
into the doctor's system?

33:55.167 --> 33:58.236
I was only trying
to find my own records,

33:58.270 --> 33:59.754
just trying to figure out

33:59.788 --> 34:00.922
what's going on.

34:00.956 --> 34:02.406
Then...

34:02.424 --> 34:05.626
that's when I find
all these other records.

34:05.677 --> 34:08.795
But the records have the exact
same genetic markers as mine.

34:08.831 --> 34:10.931
It's impossible.

34:10.966 --> 34:13.251
Unless we were all related.

34:13.284 --> 34:14.886
How many?

34:14.920 --> 34:18.556
I found 15
in the last three years.

34:18.590 --> 34:20.891
The tests
only go back that far.

34:20.926 --> 34:23.360
I'm 17.

34:23.395 --> 34:27.982
Even if I was the first,
there's hundreds of us now.

34:28.033 --> 34:30.284
Why didn't you just
bring the evidence to us?

34:30.319 --> 34:31.569
So you could do what?

34:31.603 --> 34:33.654
Put him away for 11 years,
or eight years,

34:33.688 --> 34:36.324
or 15 months
with a $30,000 fine?

34:36.375 --> 34:37.574
Because that's what happened

34:37.609 --> 34:39.409
to the last three doctors
who got caught.

34:39.444 --> 34:40.995
And then what happens to us?

34:41.045 --> 34:42.830
You know, the kids like me,
their families?

34:42.880 --> 34:45.632
Do you have any idea
what it's like to find out...

34:47.302 --> 34:49.670
You're living your life,

34:49.721 --> 34:54.809
and then just one day
out of the blue,

34:54.842 --> 34:57.929
instead of being
a part of your family,

34:57.963 --> 35:01.966
instead of being... linked

35:01.984 --> 35:05.653
to the people
that you love,

35:05.687 --> 35:08.773
you find out you're the child
of a monster.

35:08.807 --> 35:10.942
And once you hear that,
that's a life sentence.

35:10.976 --> 35:12.443
There's no going back.

35:12.477 --> 35:15.580
So what? You want me to wreck
all of these people's lives,

35:15.614 --> 35:17.331
and, what, the person
who's responsible gets what,

35:17.366 --> 35:18.950
just, like, a slap on the wrist?

35:18.984 --> 35:21.302
You thought murder
was a better answer?

35:21.336 --> 35:22.820
I got rid of the problem

35:22.838 --> 35:25.122
and protected the people
who wouldn't want to know.

35:25.156 --> 35:26.991
I mean, even his family,
they get to think of him

35:27.009 --> 35:28.876
as this, as this nice,
respected doctor

35:28.927 --> 35:30.845
who died of a heart attack.

35:30.879 --> 35:33.548
I stopped him,
no one else got hurt.

35:33.599 --> 35:38.019
Look, look, please,
just do what you want with me.

35:38.053 --> 35:40.170
I-I will help you, I-I'll plead.

35:41.940 --> 35:45.676
You can't let the rest of them
find out.

36:01.743 --> 36:04.712
<i>You allowed a dream to
direct your investigation.</i>

36:04.746 --> 36:06.380
Doesn't that concern you?

36:06.415 --> 36:08.132
It didn't direct
my investigation.

36:08.166 --> 36:11.085
It made me think we might be
missing something in the case.

36:11.136 --> 36:12.536
Which we probably are.

36:12.554 --> 36:14.055
Even if you had more time,

36:14.089 --> 36:16.206
you haven't intimated
a great deal of confidence

36:16.224 --> 36:18.059
that you actually had
anything to go on,

36:18.093 --> 36:21.545
that there was anything else
you could have done.

36:21.563 --> 36:23.014
Would you say
that that's accurate?

36:25.050 --> 36:28.686
I think that there is a lesson
here in relying on these dreams

36:28.720 --> 36:31.572
as anything other than dreams.

36:31.607 --> 36:36.294
The subconscious can be
a highly unreliable witness.

36:36.328 --> 36:38.279
<i>It's quite remarkable.</i>

36:38.330 --> 36:40.031
Really.

36:40.065 --> 36:42.350
You noted something
subconsciously,

36:42.384 --> 36:46.570
you repeated it to yourself
in your dream to focus on it,

36:46.588 --> 36:48.572
and because you imagined

36:48.590 --> 36:50.791
that you were looking
for this little guy,

36:50.826 --> 36:53.544
you shaped the investigation
of Dr. Mackenzie's murder

36:53.578 --> 36:55.796
in a way that almost anyone else
might have missed.

36:55.847 --> 36:57.264
And in the end,

36:57.299 --> 36:58.633
you got your man.

36:58.684 --> 37:01.652
I'm still missing something.

37:01.687 --> 37:03.137
The other case...

37:03.171 --> 37:06.140
<i>it didn't pay off.</i>

37:24.660 --> 37:26.243
All right, you
want to lead?

37:26.277 --> 37:27.628
What?

37:27.663 --> 37:31.916
The first suspect in our new
case got brought in last night.

37:31.950 --> 37:33.668
Would you like to lead
the interrogation?

37:36.722 --> 37:38.122
A-Are you sure?

37:38.140 --> 37:40.791
No, but I figure if you can
come at him half as strong

37:40.809 --> 37:43.260
as you came at me, it might
scare something out of him.

37:43.294 --> 37:46.130
I'm willing to try.

37:46.148 --> 37:48.015
I'm pretty sure
I can handle that.

37:48.066 --> 37:49.633
All right.

37:49.651 --> 37:50.985
Let's go to work.

38:17.646 --> 38:20.681
Perhaps your subconscious
was satisfied.

38:20.716 --> 38:24.285
Didn't feel obligated to provide
the other case with an ending.

38:24.319 --> 38:27.337
It's likely, it's because
you turned your attention

38:27.355 --> 38:29.623
to focusing yourself
on the other thing

38:29.658 --> 38:31.175
you realized you'd been missing.

38:31.193 --> 38:33.561
What's that?

38:33.612 --> 38:35.529
Rex's motorcycle.

38:35.564 --> 38:38.866
You took something that
you must have been conscious of

38:38.900 --> 38:41.702
at some low level,
and you created a story

38:41.737 --> 38:43.204
to bring your attention to it.

38:43.238 --> 38:47.975
And in the process, you find
a way that strengthens the bonds

38:48.009 --> 38:51.495
that you really find
most important.

38:52.530 --> 38:54.165
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:54.199 --> 38:56.200
Going to the beach with Cole.
Be back later.

38:59.087 --> 39:00.504
Hey, Rex?

39:00.538 --> 39:01.689
Yeah?

39:02.724 --> 39:04.558
Wear a helmet.

39:09.347 --> 39:10.598
O-Okay.

39:14.886 --> 39:16.187
Thanks.

39:22.961 --> 39:24.411
Dad?

39:24.446 --> 39:26.697
Yeah?

39:32.570 --> 39:35.206
Do you... you want to see it?

39:41.346 --> 39:43.264
Yeah, sure.

39:45.083 --> 39:47.268
All right.

40:05.954 --> 40:07.121
Yeah.

40:07.155 --> 40:09.073
Kind of can't believe
it actually runs.

40:09.107 --> 40:11.458
I can.

40:16.948 --> 40:19.283
Do you want to
take it for a spin?

40:56.872 --> 40:59.656
So?

40:59.674 --> 41:01.876
So I'm monitoring him.

41:01.927 --> 41:03.510
He's fine.

41:03.545 --> 41:06.547
No one finds that
very reassuring.

41:06.598 --> 41:10.184
I don't really care what
anyone finds reassuring.

41:10.218 --> 41:11.835
I have it
under control.

41:11.853 --> 41:13.503
That's what you said before.

41:13.521 --> 41:17.224
You should
have listened.

41:17.275 --> 41:19.193
Instead of taking out
his whole family.

41:19.227 --> 41:20.527
It's the most
insane...

41:20.562 --> 41:22.563
We can debate the details
all you want,

41:22.614 --> 41:24.315
but let's remember,
we were protecting you

41:24.349 --> 41:26.350
as much as anyone.

41:28.820 --> 41:30.187
I never asked
for that.

41:30.205 --> 41:32.206
I don't want that
kind of protection.

41:32.240 --> 41:36.660
Look, Harper,
we've got a good thing here.

41:36.694 --> 41:40.881
All anybody wants is
to get past this and keep going.

41:40.916 --> 41:43.417
Then let me
handle Britten.

41:43.468 --> 41:45.219
I'm telling you, you
do anything else,

41:45.253 --> 41:49.223
this will get much worse
before it gets better.

41:49.257 --> 41:51.008
I am on top of it.

41:51.042 --> 41:53.477
All right.

41:53.511 --> 41:55.562
I trust you'll
keep us informed.

41:58.016 --> 41:59.516
Hey.

42:01.552 --> 42:06.390
The guy that you used
for the accident... was he short?

42:06.408 --> 42:08.075
Short?

42:08.109 --> 42:10.194
Yeah, like a, like a little guy.

42:10.228 --> 42:11.996
I suppose so.

42:12.030 --> 42:13.464
Why?

42:13.498 --> 42:14.949
Did Britten say something?

42:15.000 --> 42:17.534
No, I was just wondering.

42:17.568 --> 42:19.569
Because if you think
he remembers anything...

42:19.587 --> 42:21.571
I said it's nothing.

42:21.589 --> 42:23.757
I'll keep you informed.
