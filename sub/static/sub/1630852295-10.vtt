Alright, Hiking Club!

00:36.019 --> 00:38.009
Are we ready to get out there
and explore

00:38.011 --> 00:39.021
the unknown parts
of the island?

00:39.023 --> 00:41.001
Yeah!

00:41.003 --> 00:42.020
Let me just double-check
our supplies.

00:42.022 --> 00:45.014
Okay, sandwiches, water,
compass,

00:45.016 --> 00:47.016
notebook,
extra socks,

00:47.018 --> 00:49.008
and one-two-three-
four-five-six-seven

00:49.010 --> 00:51.010
eight-nine-ten-eleven-
twelve-thirteen-fourteen

00:51.012 --> 00:53.015
rolls of toilet paper.

00:53.017 --> 00:55.010
Eh?

00:56.016 --> 00:58.016
What's everyone else gonna use?

01:04.000 --> 01:06.019
Oh, Hedgehog...

01:06.021 --> 01:08.011
Rrrr...

01:08.013 --> 01:09.017
Oof!

01:09.019 --> 01:12.002
Now we just have to decide
where to explore.

01:12.004 --> 01:13.020
Hmm.

01:13.022 --> 01:16.013
How about that
little patch of woods?

01:16.015 --> 01:18.013
Whoa.
Hey, Hedge?

01:18.015 --> 01:19.018
Doesn't that look like

01:19.020 --> 01:21.020
the New Jersey Pine Barrens
back home?

01:21.022 --> 01:24.008
Yeah!

01:24.010 --> 01:27.014
And that looks like
Susie, Betsy, and Alice.

01:31.008 --> 01:32.021
Don't you want to be turned
into the wood paneling

01:32.023 --> 01:34.009
of an infrared sauna?

01:34.011 --> 01:35.021
Hi, Susie!
Ahh!

01:35.023 --> 01:37.005
You!

01:37.007 --> 01:39.005
We didn't know there were
pine barrens on this island.

01:39.007 --> 01:41.003
Yeah, we made 'em
when we first got here,

01:41.005 --> 01:43.005
in case the Jersey Devil
ever showed up.

01:43.007 --> 01:44.018
Which he didn't.

01:44.020 --> 01:46.000
Anyway, now I'm
a-tearing 'em down

01:46.002 --> 01:47.022
and puttin' up a spa
for us witches.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.021
Eh, mainly me.

01:51.005 --> 01:53.004
Wait!

01:53.006 --> 01:54.015
The Jersey Devil?

01:54.017 --> 01:55.017
You can't, Susie!

01:55.019 --> 01:57.016
He could show up
any time!

01:57.018 --> 01:59.023
Yeah, he's just
not here right now.

02:00.001 --> 02:01.016
What's
the Jersey Devil?

02:01.018 --> 02:05.011
He's a mythical beast who roams
the New Jersey Pine Barrens.

02:05.013 --> 02:07.006
Oscar and I
met him once.

02:07.008 --> 02:09.005
Tell the story,
Oscar.
Okay.

02:09.007 --> 02:11.017
But chime in
if I start meandering.

02:11.019 --> 02:13.006
Ugh, fine!

02:13.008 --> 02:14.012
We're due for
a break anyways.

02:19.006 --> 02:20.021
It happened when we were six.

02:20.023 --> 02:22.023
My dad took me and Hedgehog
on a canoe trip

02:23.001 --> 02:26.014
through the Pine Barrens.

02:26.016 --> 02:29.012
Okay, sandwiches,
water, compass,

02:29.014 --> 02:31.019
notebook, extra socks,

02:31.021 --> 02:34.000
and one-two-three-four-five-six-
seven-eight-nine-ten-eleven

02:34.002 --> 02:36.017
twelve-thirteen-fourteen
rolls of toilet paper.

02:36.019 --> 02:38.023
What's everyone
else gonna use?

02:42.009 --> 02:44.011
Oh, Hedgehog.
You're so funny!

02:44.013 --> 02:46.003
Aw, c'mon,
Oscar.

02:46.005 --> 02:47.021
It's not
that funny.

02:47.023 --> 02:49.004
No, it is.

02:49.006 --> 02:51.017
I will never not laugh
at that joke.

02:51.019 --> 02:54.013
Wow.

02:54.015 --> 02:56.021
Paddle team
activate!

02:56.023 --> 02:58.011
Pshhh!

02:58.013 --> 02:59.021
Huh?

02:59.023 --> 03:02.003
So, I'll sit in
the back and steer.

03:02.005 --> 03:04.012
Hedgehog, you sit in the front
and help me paddle.

03:06.023 --> 03:08.013
And you sit in the middle,
buddy.

03:08.015 --> 03:09.023
Cool!

03:10.001 --> 03:13.015
Okay, Hedgehog,
ready your paddle.

03:13.017 --> 03:15.010
Oscar, you just
sit there

03:15.012 --> 03:18.001
like my special,
little sack of potatoes.

03:18.003 --> 03:21.001
A sack of potatoes
with a paddle?

03:21.003 --> 03:23.010
No, we're just going to
do it like this for now.

03:23.012 --> 03:25.017
Just till we're a little ways
down the river.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.021
Mmm...

03:35.023 --> 03:37.006
Mr. Peltzer?

03:37.008 --> 03:39.001
Huh?

03:39.003 --> 03:40.022
Oh. Hey, Oscar?

03:41.000 --> 03:43.005
Did you know being
the sack of potatoes

03:43.007 --> 03:46.012
is the most important
canoe job you can have?

03:46.014 --> 03:49.010
The person in the middle
balances out the whole canoe.

03:49.012 --> 03:52.006
Without you,
we'd tip!

03:52.008 --> 03:54.018
Plus, I need you to be
on the lookout

03:54.020 --> 03:56.002
for the Jersey Devil.

03:56.004 --> 03:58.002
Jersey Devil?

03:58.004 --> 04:00.006
Some say The Jersey Devil
was born

04:00.008 --> 04:01.010
on the 13th day

04:01.012 --> 04:03.023
of the 13th month
of the 13th year

04:04.001 --> 04:07.017
of the 13th century
on Friday the 13th,

04:07.019 --> 04:11.001
and he was the 13th baby
of the 13th witch

04:11.003 --> 04:12.017
in the 13th coven.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.018
What does the Jersey Devil
look like?

04:15.020 --> 04:18.023
Some say the head of a horse,
wings of a bat,

04:19.001 --> 04:21.006
the hooves of a --
A horse?

04:21.008 --> 04:22.012
Technically,
a goat.

04:22.014 --> 04:24.020
And maybe you'll say,
"a hoof is a hoof"

04:24.022 --> 04:27.005
but this is
a cloven hoof!

04:27.007 --> 04:29.018
Others say he has
the head of a horse

04:29.020 --> 04:32.017
and the body
of a horse...

04:32.019 --> 04:35.012
so he might
just be a horse.

04:35.014 --> 04:37.008
Whoa.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.019
He was first sighted
in the 1700s,

04:39.021 --> 04:43.017
and they say he's lurked
through the Barrens ever
since,

04:43.019 --> 04:45.015
looking for sandwiches.

04:45.017 --> 04:48.009
Why doesn't he just make
his own sandwiches?

04:48.011 --> 04:50.023
Because sandwiches
always taste better

04:51.001 --> 04:53.012
when someone else
makes them.

04:53.014 --> 04:55.000
Mm-hmm.

04:55.002 --> 04:56.020
There are supposedly
three signs

04:56.022 --> 04:58.018
that the Jersey Devil
is nearby.

04:58.020 --> 05:03.009
First, the air around
you gets --
cold.

05:03.011 --> 05:06.012
Second, you get a tickle --

05:06.014 --> 05:07.016
a tickle in your throat.

05:08.020 --> 05:09.022
And the third?

05:10.000 --> 05:14.020
You hear a terrible,
inhuman tummy grumble.

05:14.022 --> 05:16.016
Ahh!

05:16.018 --> 05:18.006
Hey,
let's have lunch.

05:20.017 --> 05:21.020
I'm finished, Dad.

05:21.022 --> 05:24.005
Can you wash
the pan for us?

05:28.010 --> 05:30.006
It's a bummer Teller
didn't come.

05:30.008 --> 05:32.001
We need someone
to balance out the middle.

05:32.003 --> 05:33.006
Don't worry.

05:33.008 --> 05:35.001
We'll just put the cooler
in the middle.

05:35.003 --> 05:36.021
It does the same job
as a person,

05:36.023 --> 05:38.022
plus it keeps the drinks cold!

05:40.009 --> 05:42.017
Not that anyone asked,
but just to be clear,

05:42.019 --> 05:45.016
the list of canoe jobs
in order of importance are --

05:45.018 --> 05:47.005
back paddler,
front paddler,

05:47.007 --> 05:49.022
then the least important
person in the middle.

05:55.023 --> 05:58.014
How's my little sack
of potatoes doing?

05:58.016 --> 06:00.014
Still keeping
the boat steady?

06:02.012 --> 06:04.011
Any Jersey Devil
sightings?

06:04.013 --> 06:07.008
Cause I'm ready.

06:07.010 --> 06:08.013
Eh?

06:08.015 --> 06:10.013
Any sightings?
Huh?

06:10.015 --> 06:12.012
Hedgehog can I get your help?

06:12.014 --> 06:14.017
I don't think
Oscar can hear me.

06:14.019 --> 06:16.011
Um, okay.

06:19.016 --> 06:21.006
Dad, I know you lied to me

06:21.008 --> 06:23.012
about the importance
of the middle seat.

06:23.014 --> 06:26.010
Oscar, it really is
an important job.

06:26.012 --> 06:27.023
It's not important!

06:28.001 --> 06:30.018
Look, I'm standing up
and nothing is happening.

06:30.020 --> 06:32.008
Whoa!

06:36.016 --> 06:42.007
I feel like that was
partially my fault.

06:42.009 --> 06:44.001
Alright, let's see
what we've got.

06:44.003 --> 06:45.008
Ooooh,
our tent!

06:45.010 --> 06:46.021
Good thing
it's in a bag.

06:50.017 --> 06:54.002
Looks like we'll be sleeping
under the stars tonight.

06:58.006 --> 07:00.007
Dad will you stay up
with us in case

07:00.009 --> 07:04.023
The Jersey Devil comes
to steal our damp sandwiches?

07:05.001 --> 07:07.006
Of course I will,
champ.

07:07.008 --> 07:08.011
Hm.

07:09.020 --> 07:12.000
Ahh.

07:13.006 --> 07:16.004
What was that?

07:16.006 --> 07:17.010
Nothing.

07:17.012 --> 07:19.005
Come on, your dad
was just kidding

07:19.007 --> 07:20.022
with all that
Jersey Devil stuff.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
No.
He never kids.

07:23.002 --> 07:25.019
The Jersey Devil
is definitely out there.

07:25.021 --> 07:27.017
Ahh!

07:27.019 --> 07:29.017
Please don't be there,
please don't be there,

07:29.019 --> 07:33.005
please don't be there!

07:36.009 --> 07:37.010
False alarm.

07:37.012 --> 07:38.022
Are you
feeling cold?

07:39.001 --> 07:41.001
Like,
Jersey Devil cold?

07:41.003 --> 07:42.013
Because no way.

07:42.015 --> 07:44.017
I actually feel
super hot.

07:47.006 --> 07:49.018
H-Hedgehog...

07:49.020 --> 07:51.016
I have a tickle
in my throat.

07:51.018 --> 07:56.012
Uuuh, that could just be
your tree bark allergy?

07:56.014 --> 07:58.008
Yeah.

07:58.010 --> 08:00.012
Ahh!

08:00.014 --> 08:02.016
Probably just
another squirrel.

08:05.006 --> 08:08.021
Terrible, inhuman
tummy grumble.

08:11.015 --> 08:12.020
Oh, right.

08:12.022 --> 08:14.000
We didn't eat dinner.

08:14.002 --> 08:15.012
Phew.

08:15.014 --> 08:18.016
Okay, guess everything
is safe, time to get some rest!

08:18.018 --> 08:20.004
Sure am tired!

08:23.006 --> 08:25.001
Uh, yeah,
some nice sleep.

08:25.003 --> 08:27.000
Next thing we know,
the sun will be up

08:27.002 --> 08:29.000
and we'll be
well-rested and safe.

08:32.004 --> 08:33.005
Boy, oh, boy.

08:33.007 --> 08:36.002
How did you
guys sleep?

08:36.004 --> 08:38.005
Ahh, great!

08:38.007 --> 08:40.004
Let's make an early start
back to the car.

08:40.006 --> 08:42.018
Hey, Oscar, would you
mind sitting in --

08:42.020 --> 08:44.013
I love the middle seat!
It's the best seat in the
canoe!

08:44.015 --> 08:46.005
I'm already in it!
Let's go!

08:46.007 --> 08:49.005
Oh boy,
you all got ready fast.

08:49.007 --> 08:50.014
I'll gather the rest
of the stuff.

08:50.016 --> 08:52.013
Let's go, let's go,
let's go!

08:52.015 --> 08:53.014
Kids?

08:53.016 --> 08:55.011
Did you guys eat
our sandwiches

08:55.013 --> 08:58.012
to make it look like
The Jersey Devil was here?

08:58.014 --> 09:00.014
Oh, you guys
are good.

09:03.005 --> 09:05.006
So, in conclusion,

09:05.008 --> 09:07.008
the importance
of the canoe's middle seat

09:07.010 --> 09:09.023
cannot be overstated enough.

09:10.001 --> 09:12.000
Wait,
so that's it?

09:12.002 --> 09:13.010
Huh?

09:13.012 --> 09:15.019
More of a coming-of-age story
than anything else.

09:15.021 --> 09:17.023
Yeah, you guys
said you met him.

09:18.001 --> 09:19.008
But did you?

09:19.010 --> 09:22.015
Well, I guess if we really
wanted to meet him,

09:22.017 --> 09:23.015
we could have?

09:23.017 --> 09:25.000
Lies.

09:25.002 --> 09:26.022
No one will
ever meet him.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.020
What a-your father left out
is the Jersey Devil

09:29.022 --> 09:32.017
is the best hider
in the magic world.

09:32.019 --> 09:36.004
Have you ever played
hide and seek with a ghost?

09:36.006 --> 09:38.002
It'd be easier to find
an invisible creature

09:38.004 --> 09:39.014
than to spot
the Jersey Devil.

09:39.016 --> 09:41.018
Couple of corn dogs like you
would have never seen him,

09:41.020 --> 09:44.004
and no one
ever will!

09:45.009 --> 09:47.011
But Susie,
if I may call you that,

09:47.013 --> 09:49.002
by your
own admission,

09:49.004 --> 09:52.002
the Jersey Devil
is incredible at hiding.

09:52.004 --> 09:54.013
Yes, I had a beautiful
analogy about it.

09:54.015 --> 09:56.018
So, then
would you say

09:56.020 --> 09:59.019
the Jersey Devil could be
hiding anywhere in the world?

09:59.021 --> 10:02.002
I mean,
yes, Hedgehog.

10:02.004 --> 10:03.014
Then you admit it!

10:03.016 --> 10:07.002
He could very well be living
in these pine barrens right
now

10:07.004 --> 10:08.020
and we wouldn't
even know it.

10:08.022 --> 10:10.006
What? No.

10:10.008 --> 10:13.001
Wait. That's not --
ugh!

10:13.003 --> 10:15.014
Therefore, razing
these Pine Barrens

10:15.016 --> 10:16.020
and potentially
displacing

10:16.022 --> 10:19.015
the Jersey Devil
is a non-option.

10:19.017 --> 10:21.007
I rest my case.

10:21.009 --> 10:22.021
She's right,
you know.

10:24.006 --> 10:25.008
You know what?

10:25.010 --> 10:27.001
I don't even
need a new spa!

10:27.003 --> 10:30.016
I'll just
use my old spa!

10:30.018 --> 10:33.016
I hate it when she
calls me "old spa."

10:36.021 --> 10:38.004
Come on,
let's keep going!

10:38.006 --> 10:39.021
This hike isn't gonna
hike itself.

10:39.023 --> 10:43.007
That's because hikes
don't have feet.

10:48.011 --> 10:49.021
Come on, Oscar.

10:49.023 --> 10:51.014
Let's go.

10:53.021 --> 10:55.017
I'll catch up with
you guys in a second!

11:18.003 --> 11:20.015
I hate it when she
calls me "old spa."
