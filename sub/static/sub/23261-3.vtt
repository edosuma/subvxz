WEBVTT

00:39.079 --> 00:41.079
(Distant, indistinct arguing)

00:42.959 --> 00:44.959
WOMAN: You are a child!

00:45.000 --> 00:46.879
(Arguing continues)

00:46.920 --> 00:48.879
GIRL: I'm not...I'm not having sex!

00:48.920 --> 00:52.920
You're 15 years old, for God's sake,
I mean, it's illegal! Do you realise
that?

00:52.959 --> 00:56.119
Of course you realise that, but
getting drink?

00:56.159 --> 00:58.720
You silly fool! What do think
your father's gonna say?

00:58.759 --> 01:00.519
Do you realise...
Look, I'm leaving!

01:00.560 --> 01:02.920
Right!
(Door slams)

01:04.800 --> 01:06.600
Night, night, darling.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.400
(Door shuts)

01:17.479 --> 01:18.600
(Soft sigh)

01:38.400 --> 01:40.839
Mam?

01:40.879 --> 01:42.759
(TV on)

01:42.800 --> 01:47.039
'..no novelty acts, and auditions
are being held in a theme park
for the first time.'

01:47.079 --> 01:48.720
Mam?

02:39.839 --> 02:42.720
Oh, for crying out loud!

02:47.639 --> 02:50.400
(Tyres screech)
I've just been up here!

03:03.079 --> 03:05.079
(Police radio)

03:07.920 --> 03:09.400
You found us, then?
Oh, shut up.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.879
Who'd live round here?
It's like a bloody maze!

03:11.920 --> 03:14.280
A quiet maze. Good schools,
low crime rate.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.119
Huh, not that low, apparently.

03:19.280 --> 03:20.879
So come on, take me through it.

03:20.920 --> 03:23.239
Our victim's name is Alison Glenn.

03:23.920 --> 03:25.879
43-year-old housewife.

03:25.920 --> 03:29.119
She was found dead in the back
garden at 7:00 this morning.

03:30.400 --> 03:33.239
Seems like someone decided
to crack open her skull.

03:34.239 --> 03:35.920
Who found the body?

03:35.959 --> 03:38.319
Her son Elliot.

03:38.360 --> 03:40.039
What age? Ten.

03:42.200 --> 03:43.800
Was there no-one else in the house?

03:43.839 --> 03:46.119
Big sister Molly, 15.

03:46.159 --> 03:47.759
She's the one who called it in.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.319
And where are they now?

03:49.360 --> 03:52.239
Across the road at a friend's house.
I've got Jac with them.

03:53.720 --> 03:55.519
Kids went to bed at nine.

03:55.560 --> 03:57.039
Mum stayed up.

03:57.079 --> 03:59.159
Neither said they heard anything
through the night.

03:59.200 --> 04:01.879
Husband's a prison officer
at Greenpoint. He was at work.

04:09.680 --> 04:13.039
Those patio doors, were they closed
or open when the lad found her?

04:13.079 --> 04:14.200
Open.

04:14.239 --> 04:16.639
Forced?
They're intact.

04:18.319 --> 04:20.479
There's no sign of any struggle.

04:20.519 --> 04:22.200
Not in here, no.

04:23.800 --> 04:25.800
No prizes for guessing
the cause of death.

04:25.839 --> 04:28.039
We're looking at a blunt force
trauma wound

04:28.079 --> 04:30.720
to the back of the skull.
Struck from behind.

04:30.759 --> 04:32.800
That would be my opinion.

04:32.839 --> 04:36.119
How many blows?
More than one, less than ten.

04:36.159 --> 04:37.839
Someone saw red, then.

04:38.720 --> 04:41.720
Did she put up a fight?
No sign of any defence wounds.

04:41.759 --> 04:43.759
What about a weapon?

04:44.360 --> 04:45.600
If you look here,

04:45.639 --> 04:48.560
there are particles of stone
embedded in the wound and hair.

04:52.879 --> 04:54.920
So we're looking for a stone
or a rock.

05:00.959 --> 05:02.439
That one's been removed.

05:02.479 --> 05:04.239
That could well be our murder weapon.

05:04.280 --> 05:06.519
And if it was,

05:06.560 --> 05:08.079
they improvised.

05:08.119 --> 05:11.200
She wasn't scared. Ma'am?

05:11.239 --> 05:13.680
She was dressed for bed.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.200
Lured out here.

05:17.239 --> 05:20.639
And whoever or whatever it was,
she wasn't afraid of it.

05:20.680 --> 05:22.280
Go on.

05:22.319 --> 05:24.079
I mean, that time of night!

05:24.119 --> 05:26.639
No husband, kids upstairs.

05:26.680 --> 05:28.839
Most women would stay put,

05:28.879 --> 05:31.400
lock the door, maybe even call us.

05:31.439 --> 05:32.639
But not her.

05:33.439 --> 05:35.600
She came right out here to meet it.

05:36.479 --> 05:39.600
Which means...
She knew her killer!

05:39.639 --> 05:41.360
Exactly.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.600
Let's go talk to those bairns.

05:54.879 --> 05:58.159
How are they bearing up?
I think they're still in shock.

05:58.200 --> 06:01.239
Who's that?
Asha Dabra. Family friend.

06:01.280 --> 06:03.039
Seemed she and the victim were
close.

06:03.079 --> 06:05.519
You talk with her.

06:05.560 --> 06:07.239
I'll handle the kids.

06:11.159 --> 06:13.159
Thanks.

06:18.119 --> 06:20.159
My name's Vera Stanhope.

06:22.680 --> 06:24.319
And I'm a police officer.

06:26.479 --> 06:28.479
I'm very sorry about your mam.

06:31.720 --> 06:37.039
Now I know it's hard, but I am going
to have to ask you some questions.

06:37.079 --> 06:38.639
All right?

06:38.680 --> 06:41.439
She was murdered, wasn't she?

06:43.159 --> 06:46.560
I'm afraid right now
that is what it looks like, pet.

06:49.200 --> 06:53.519
My sergeant tells me you were both
home last night, is that right?

06:55.839 --> 06:58.119
Did either of you see what happened?

06:58.159 --> 06:59.839
We were asleep.

06:59.879 --> 07:02.159
Oh. Yeah, you were both up in bed
by nine.

07:04.680 --> 07:05.759
Yeah.

07:07.560 --> 07:10.600
It's a terrible shock. Just awful.

07:10.639 --> 07:14.280
I mean, you don't expect this kind
of thing to happen in Larchford.

07:14.319 --> 07:17.039
We can't believe it, can we, Sahil?

07:18.000 --> 07:19.639
Were you friends with Mrs Glenn?

07:19.680 --> 07:21.600
Yeah. We worked together.

07:21.639 --> 07:25.119
Well, I worked. Alison volunteered.
Volunteered where?

07:25.159 --> 07:28.319
At the Larchford Day Centre.
Near the library.

07:28.360 --> 07:31.119
It's a drop-in centre
for pensioners.

07:31.159 --> 07:32.600
Team bingo, mostly.

07:32.639 --> 07:34.720
When was the last time
you spoke to Alison?

07:34.759 --> 07:36.959
Yesterday morning, at the centre.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.920
She was working up until lunchtime.

07:38.959 --> 07:42.519
Either of you see anyone last night
in the street? Hear anything?

07:44.079 --> 07:47.200
Can you think of anyone who would
want to harm Mrs Glenn?

07:49.280 --> 07:50.920
Sahil?

07:53.639 --> 07:55.920
OK, I need you to think hard.

07:55.959 --> 07:58.839
Did your mam seem her usual self?

07:58.879 --> 08:02.800
Do you mean, was she acting like she
might get murdered sometime soon?

08:08.560 --> 08:10.839
I know this is hard,

08:10.879 --> 08:12.560
and I know you're upset,

08:13.759 --> 08:16.600
but if I'm going to find out who did
this to your mam,

08:16.639 --> 08:19.400
I'm going to need your help.
All right?

08:21.519 --> 08:23.319
Hm?

08:24.720 --> 08:27.920
How did your mam seem
over the past couple of weeks?

08:31.600 --> 08:33.560
She was just...

08:33.600 --> 08:34.879
..Mum.

08:37.959 --> 08:40.039
She was just our mum.

08:40.079 --> 08:42.239
(Sobs)

08:48.400 --> 08:50.119
All right, lass.

08:50.159 --> 08:52.479
(Inhales and sobs)

08:54.479 --> 08:57.119
Ma'am? You're needed outside.

08:57.159 --> 09:01.239
I need to see my wife! It's my home!
That's enough!

09:01.280 --> 09:04.039
Get your hands off me!
Mr Glenn! I want to see my wife!

09:04.079 --> 09:06.479
That's enough, sir.
I want to see my wife!

09:06.519 --> 09:10.039
That's enough.
Mr Glenn. Mr Glenn! That's it.

09:10.079 --> 09:12.720
Your children...are watching.

09:23.119 --> 09:26.000
Now, they need...their dad.

09:26.720 --> 09:27.920
OK?

09:32.800 --> 09:35.519
I left at about 6:30 last night.

09:38.079 --> 09:39.920
And how was your wife?

09:41.600 --> 09:44.439
Fine.
That was the last time you spoke?

09:44.479 --> 09:47.600
No. I sent her a text about 8:00,

09:47.639 --> 09:49.680
just checking in for the night.

09:49.720 --> 09:51.839
Did she reply to your text?

09:51.879 --> 09:53.600
Aye.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.759
She told me to bring home milk.

09:59.600 --> 10:03.360
Michael, can you think of anyone
who might have wanted to do this?

10:04.519 --> 10:06.839
Everyone liked Alison.

10:06.879 --> 10:08.920
Lots of friends, eh?

10:10.639 --> 10:12.639
Her and Asha were sort of close.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.159
At least, they used to be.

10:14.200 --> 10:16.519
Did something happen between them?

10:16.560 --> 10:20.839
Asha and Karim, that's Asha's
husband, divorced about a year ago.

10:21.839 --> 10:26.119
Asha's been a bit funny since then,
and her and Alison drifted apart.

10:26.159 --> 10:29.360
What about her family?
She never knew her parents.

10:29.400 --> 10:32.800
She was adopted?
No. Grew up in care.

10:33.680 --> 10:35.720
How long have you worked
at Greenpoint?

10:37.280 --> 10:40.319
About 15 year.
You ever had any trouble there?

10:40.360 --> 10:42.119
There's always trouble there.

10:42.159 --> 10:45.959
Could what happened to your wife
be somehow connected to the prison?

10:46.000 --> 10:47.920
No, no. Definitely not.

10:47.959 --> 10:50.119
Are you sure of that?
Positive.

10:53.119 --> 10:56.519
OK, then, Michael. That's it for now.

10:56.560 --> 10:58.720
I'm afraid you can't go back to your
house

10:58.759 --> 11:01.159
until my officers have finished
their work.

11:01.200 --> 11:04.239
Is there somewhere you and the kids
can stay?

11:08.200 --> 11:09.560
Right.

11:11.720 --> 11:13.680
I want to see Alison.

11:15.119 --> 11:18.519
We'll make arrangements.
I want to see her today!

11:30.720 --> 11:33.039
Alison Glenn, 43,

11:33.079 --> 11:36.200
your typical middle-class suburban
wife.

11:36.239 --> 11:39.400
Cause of death, blunt force trauma
to the back of the head.

11:39.439 --> 11:44.159
Nice house, nice kids, nice life.

11:44.200 --> 11:48.920
There's no obvious motive at the
moment, but someone had a reason.

11:48.959 --> 11:52.560
Now there's two things to take from
the crime scene.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.879
One, the killer improvised,

11:54.920 --> 11:57.800
we think used a rock from the garden.

11:57.839 --> 12:01.560
Which suggests this was opportunistic
rather than premeditated.

12:01.600 --> 12:04.400
Have we found this rock yet?
Still searching.

12:04.439 --> 12:09.319
Now the second thing is,
the location, the back garden.

12:09.360 --> 12:13.519
I think...our victim knew her killer.

12:13.560 --> 12:16.200
Which prompts the question...

12:16.239 --> 12:19.159
Why didn't they use the front door?
Correct.

12:19.200 --> 12:23.479
Now, come on, wake up, I want to know
everything about her life.

12:23.519 --> 12:27.000
Mark, all the usual things - bank
statements, phone logs,

12:27.039 --> 12:29.200
emails, social media.

12:29.239 --> 12:31.119
Kenny, draw me up a timeline.

12:31.159 --> 12:33.920
I want to know everything she did
right up until last night.

12:33.959 --> 12:36.400
And Jack, talk to the neighbours.

12:36.439 --> 12:38.319
And we'll check out the husband's
work.

12:38.360 --> 12:41.400
He's adamant prison was not
a factor.

12:41.439 --> 12:43.800
But let's not rule that out.

12:43.839 --> 12:45.159
What?

12:45.200 --> 12:48.159
That was Greenpoint Prison.
And?

12:48.200 --> 12:51.639
They said Michael Glenn wasn't
at work last night.

12:51.680 --> 12:53.200
Annual leave.

13:31.239 --> 13:33.239
(Distant siren)

13:38.159 --> 13:40.119
You lied to us, Michael.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.680
I didn't lie.

13:47.720 --> 13:51.239
You never actually asked
if I was at work last night.

13:51.280 --> 13:53.639
You were in your uniform, Michael!

13:54.479 --> 13:57.039
I'd just found out my wife was dead.

13:57.839 --> 13:59.759
I wasn't exactly thinking straight.

14:01.200 --> 14:04.439
So where were you?
At a pub with my brother, Jason.

14:06.039 --> 14:09.079
I stayed over at his place.
Now here's the thing.

14:09.119 --> 14:11.879
You booked last night off
a week ago.

14:11.920 --> 14:14.400
And your wife and kids thought
you were at work.

14:14.439 --> 14:17.639
And you left the house yesterday
evening dressed for the part.

14:17.680 --> 14:21.479
So if you were just going to the pub
with your brother,

14:21.519 --> 14:23.959
why all the cloak and dagger?

14:26.519 --> 14:29.400
I didn't want Alison to know.

14:29.439 --> 14:31.200
Why not?

14:32.560 --> 14:35.519
About...six year ago,

14:36.560 --> 14:38.879
we had trouble getting credit.

14:38.920 --> 14:42.879
Turns out Jason had been applying
for loans using our address.

14:42.920 --> 14:45.119
Took ages to sort out.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.759
Alison pretty much washed her hands
of him.

14:48.800 --> 14:51.479
I'd have done the same.

14:51.519 --> 14:54.639
But you didn't?
I wish I had.

14:57.839 --> 15:01.000
At least then I would have been
at home with Alison last night.

15:08.239 --> 15:09.800
Maybe he made an honest mistake.

15:09.839 --> 15:12.439
Yeah, maybe. Maybe not.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.519
Oh, come on, he's not stupid.

15:14.560 --> 15:16.319
He'd have known we'd check his work

15:16.360 --> 15:18.800
and if he was planning on using
a false alibi,

15:18.839 --> 15:21.079
then he would have picked a harder
one to crack.

15:21.119 --> 15:24.479
Look, nothing about this murder
suggests it was planned.

15:24.519 --> 15:28.280
Maybe it was just buying more time to
concoct an alibi with his brother.

15:28.319 --> 15:33.039
You've got a tendency to think the
worst of people. You know that?
It stops me from being disappointed.

15:37.159 --> 15:39.759
You can't leave them there.
I'm going to take them out.

15:39.800 --> 15:41.800
When? They've been lying there
for a week.

15:41.839 --> 15:44.039
Jason Glenn?
(Baby cries in distance)

15:45.039 --> 15:47.000
Who wants to know?
DCI Vera Stanhope.

15:47.039 --> 15:49.280
This is DS Healy.

15:49.319 --> 15:51.759
Can we have a word inside?

15:56.959 --> 15:59.479
Hold on.

15:59.519 --> 16:02.119
When did this happen?
Sometime last night.

16:03.119 --> 16:07.039
Michael never told you?
What?

16:07.079 --> 16:10.680
No... My phone's been off.

16:14.039 --> 16:15.119
(Phone buzzes)

16:15.159 --> 16:17.879
Ah. Bloody hell.
Seven missed calls.

16:19.360 --> 16:20.600
Is Michael all right?

16:20.639 --> 16:23.439
Oh, God.

16:23.479 --> 16:24.759
The kids.

16:25.879 --> 16:28.439
I should go and see them.
No, there's time for that.

16:28.479 --> 16:30.639
Right now I need to ask you
some questions.

16:31.479 --> 16:34.000
Like, where were you last night?

16:34.039 --> 16:36.000
I was out. With Michael.

16:36.039 --> 16:38.439
Were you with him all night?
Er, yeah.

16:38.479 --> 16:40.039
Turned up about seven.

16:40.079 --> 16:42.400
Erm, went down the Admiral,

16:42.439 --> 16:45.400
the pub off Carol Street.
The game was on.

16:45.439 --> 16:47.000
What time did you leave?

16:48.200 --> 16:49.800
Throwing-out time. At midnight.

16:49.839 --> 16:55.680
Did you go on anywhere else?
Nah. We just come back home, like.

16:55.720 --> 16:57.800
What about this morning?

16:57.839 --> 16:59.879
When I got up, he'd already gone.

16:59.920 --> 17:01.800
I just assumed he'd gone home.

17:02.600 --> 17:06.360
Michael tells us you and Alison
didn't get on too well.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.319
Is that right?

17:08.360 --> 17:10.360
Look...

17:11.319 --> 17:15.200
I'll hold my hands up and admit
I've caused a bit of trouble

17:15.239 --> 17:17.159
for Michael and Alison in the past.

17:19.600 --> 17:22.839
But I don't think that was the real
reason Alison didn't like us.

17:22.879 --> 17:24.879
So what was the real reason?

17:26.200 --> 17:29.400
She was jealous.
Of you? Of me and Michael.

17:30.319 --> 17:32.280
She could never...understand...

17:33.039 --> 17:34.879
..how close we are.

17:34.920 --> 17:37.479
Don't always get on.
But we always stand by each other.

17:37.519 --> 17:39.400
She didn't get that.

17:39.439 --> 17:42.439
And how did Michael feel about that?

17:42.479 --> 17:45.800
Well, I mean, he loved her.
Obviously.

17:45.839 --> 17:47.920
I'd do anything for her, but...

17:48.839 --> 17:51.839
Alison had to be in control of
everything.

17:53.479 --> 17:55.079
I think that was a strain for him.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.920
I don't trust that Jason as far as
I can throw him.

18:02.039 --> 18:07.360
But we nay have to consider the fact
that Alison had Michael on a tight
leash.

18:07.400 --> 18:08.959
Are we saying he was henpecked? Mm.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
That's a weak motive, isn't it?

18:11.039 --> 18:14.000
It's not about motivation.
It's about opportunity.

18:14.039 --> 18:16.280
Right now Jason is backing
his brother's alibi.

18:16.319 --> 18:19.720
Aye. Which is why I want you two
down the Admiral pub

18:19.759 --> 18:22.600
asking questions. Make sure they WERE
both there.

18:22.639 --> 18:24.839
Er, did you talk to the neighbours?

18:24.879 --> 18:27.720
One guy said he saw a red hatchback
parked near the Glenn house,

18:27.759 --> 18:30.360
round about ten o'clock.
Registration?

18:30.400 --> 18:33.560
No, but he said it was old, had
a broken headlight right-hand side.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.879
See if you can chase it up.

18:35.920 --> 18:37.920
Kenny, timeline?

18:37.959 --> 18:41.400
Yeah, Alison Glenn had a shift
at the day centre yesterday.

18:41.439 --> 18:45.200
Left about two.
Picked up Elliot from school.

18:45.239 --> 18:48.800
Had another appointment with her
daughter's form teacher at four.

18:48.839 --> 18:50.519
What was that about?

18:50.560 --> 18:54.920
I'm not sure. But Alison made
the appointment that morning, so..

18:54.959 --> 18:56.680
could have been something urgent.

18:57.560 --> 18:59.280
I want to talk to that teacher.

18:59.319 --> 19:01.079
OK.

19:01.119 --> 19:04.200
Ma'am. What? I've been trying to
contact the victim's dad,

19:04.239 --> 19:05.879
but there's no number for him.

19:05.920 --> 19:07.639
That's because he doesn't exist.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.039
She was brought up in care.

19:10.079 --> 19:13.439
No, she had family.
Her dad, Robert Naresby.

19:13.479 --> 19:15.319
Her brother, Tom.

19:15.360 --> 19:18.079
Her mam, Ann-Marie, I'm still trying
to trace her.

19:20.360 --> 19:23.720
Her dad and brother live
in Corbridge? Yeah, past 30 years.

19:25.280 --> 19:28.319
You must have made a mistake.
No mistake, Michael.

19:29.280 --> 19:31.319
Alison didn't have a family.

19:31.360 --> 19:33.239
Her mother died when she was a baby.

19:33.280 --> 19:35.400
She was brought up in a care home.

19:35.439 --> 19:38.879
Which care home?
Oh! I don't know!

19:39.600 --> 19:42.159
(Exhales) Someplace outside
Newcastle.

19:42.200 --> 19:45.280
She never really spoke about it.
It was difficult for her.

19:46.879 --> 19:48.879
Like, I don't know who these people
are.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.639
Looking for Robert Naresby.

20:17.639 --> 20:20.360
That's me dad.
Is he about?

20:23.039 --> 20:25.079
You shouldn't be here.

20:26.159 --> 20:28.239
He doesn't like it
when people come round.

20:28.280 --> 20:30.239
We're not just people, we're police.

20:30.280 --> 20:32.159
Are you?

20:35.920 --> 20:37.839
I want to be a policeman.

20:41.879 --> 20:44.079
Are you Tom Naresby?

20:44.119 --> 20:45.319
(Door bangs)

20:45.360 --> 20:47.600
Tom. Soup's ready.

20:47.639 --> 20:50.079
But Dad...
Inside.

21:01.720 --> 21:05.479
Whatever you've got to say,
say it quick. You're trespassing.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.519
We need to talk to you
about your daughter.

21:10.879 --> 21:12.000
Alison.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.680
Appreciate you coming out here.

21:18.720 --> 21:21.479
But we already know about Alison.

21:21.519 --> 21:23.319
Heard it on the news this morning.

21:23.360 --> 21:26.680
When did you last see your daughter?

21:26.720 --> 21:29.159
25 years ago...

21:29.200 --> 21:31.600
when she walked out
on me and her brother.

21:33.039 --> 21:35.680
Why did she walk out?
Never said.

21:35.720 --> 21:39.519
She must have had a reason.
I suppose she must have.

21:40.600 --> 21:44.079
But now we'll never know
what it was.

21:44.119 --> 21:46.720
Ever try to make contact with her?

21:46.759 --> 21:49.360
No.
She only lived half an hour away.

21:49.400 --> 21:52.319
So the bloke on the news said.

21:52.360 --> 21:54.680
How about you, Tom?

21:55.759 --> 21:59.039
Nay point asking him.
And why is that?

21:59.079 --> 22:02.200
He doesn't understand things.

22:03.600 --> 22:06.800
How about her mam?
Was she and Alison close?

22:06.839 --> 22:08.720
I doubt it.

22:08.759 --> 22:12.479
She ran out on us ten years before
Alison did.

22:14.680 --> 22:16.680
Know where we can find her?
No.

22:19.319 --> 22:21.319
Mr Naresby...

22:24.360 --> 22:28.839
Alison had a family, a husband,
children...

22:30.039 --> 22:32.000
You've got a couple of grandkids.

22:36.600 --> 22:38.519
OK.

22:39.560 --> 22:41.400
I know you're just doing your job.

22:43.239 --> 22:47.360
But he stopped being a part of our
family the day she walked out.

22:48.360 --> 22:50.360
We won't be grieving her.

22:52.519 --> 22:55.479
And we've got no interest
in seeing her family.

22:58.680 --> 23:00.680
Now...

23:02.560 --> 23:04.839
..if you're done, you can go.

23:12.800 --> 23:19.000
(Groans)
Just one last question, Mr Naresby.

23:19.039 --> 23:20.800
Where were you last night?

23:23.079 --> 23:24.839
We were here.

23:24.879 --> 23:27.000
We're always here.

23:34.400 --> 23:36.039
(Door shuts)

23:39.759 --> 23:43.920
'You're meeting with Molly's form
teacher after parents' evening
tonight. 8pm.'

23:44.879 --> 23:48.400
Now we know why Alison Glenn told
her husband she was an orphan.

23:48.439 --> 23:50.280
Who'd want a dad like him?

23:50.319 --> 23:52.519
Yeah, maybe.

23:53.439 --> 23:58.600
But there again, denying his
existence is a bit over the top,
isn't it?

23:58.639 --> 24:01.200
I don't know. Charlie's got a big
brother

24:01.239 --> 24:03.920
and her and her family haven't
spoken to him in a decade.

24:03.959 --> 24:06.400
But you know he exists.

24:06.439 --> 24:09.639
I bet she doesn't going around
saying she's an only child.

24:09.680 --> 24:11.079
I suppose.

24:12.759 --> 24:14.759
25 years ago Alison walked out.

24:15.959 --> 24:19.200
And his anger is still as strong.

24:20.280 --> 24:23.519
Check old man Naresby out.
I'll drop you back at the station.

24:23.560 --> 24:25.560
Where are YOU going?
Back to school.

24:32.319 --> 24:35.360
Of course we were all very shocked
to hear about Mrs Glenn.

24:35.400 --> 24:37.119
Of course. Aye.

24:37.159 --> 24:40.519
Do we know what happened to her?
Oh, it's early days yet.

24:41.600 --> 24:43.639
(Footsteps)

24:43.680 --> 24:46.039
Molly's form teacher.

24:46.079 --> 24:49.000
DCI Stanhope.
Tina Brennan.

24:51.200 --> 24:54.159
So, er, how can we help?

24:57.439 --> 25:00.720
Alison Glenn arranged a meeting here
at the school yesterday.

25:00.759 --> 25:02.759
Yes. She came to see me.

25:06.079 --> 25:07.800
Was she worried about Molly?

25:08.400 --> 25:10.720
Mrs Glenn had some concerns

25:10.759 --> 25:14.239
about her and another pupil
in her class. Sahil Dabra.

25:14.280 --> 25:16.360
The lad who lives on her street?

25:17.319 --> 25:21.639
Yeah. She felt Sahil had developed
an unhealthy interest in Molly.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.680
Unhealthy? What does that mean?

25:24.680 --> 25:29.759
Well, obviously...we're dealing with
teenagers, lots of hormones.

25:29.800 --> 25:33.119
Crushes, infatuations
are par for the course.

25:33.159 --> 25:36.079
However, Sahil's feelings for Molly

25:36.119 --> 25:38.920
are unusually intense.

25:38.959 --> 25:41.119
It's probably just a phase.

25:41.159 --> 25:43.319
Even so, we agreed to Mrs Glenn
the request

25:43.360 --> 25:46.920
to have Molly moved to another
class, as a precaution.

25:46.959 --> 25:49.439
As a precaution to what?

25:49.479 --> 25:54.119
About a month ago, Molly had a bit
of an altercation with a pupil in
Year 9.

25:55.560 --> 25:57.400
When Sahil found out about it,

25:57.439 --> 25:59.720
he attacked the lad
outside the school.

26:01.959 --> 26:03.920
Sahil shattered the boy's jaw.

26:20.439 --> 26:22.439
Oh, Molly, love!

26:32.079 --> 26:34.800
Come on, we're going to Jason's
house.

26:47.119 --> 26:50.879
Headmaster said Sahil Dabra was
a model student until last year

26:50.920 --> 26:52.479
when his parents divorced.

26:52.519 --> 26:54.600
Since then he's been trouble.

26:54.639 --> 26:57.639
Lost interest in his studies.
Gets into scraps.

26:57.680 --> 27:00.319
Even so, it is a bit of a jump to go
from school bad boy

27:00.360 --> 27:02.680
to cold-blooded killer.

27:02.720 --> 27:05.239
Aye, but she wasn't killed in cold
blood, was she?

27:05.280 --> 27:07.400
It's a crime of passion,

27:08.439 --> 27:10.639
and there's nowt more passionate...

27:10.680 --> 27:12.680
than a teenager in love.

27:19.400 --> 27:22.119
Sahil likes to come in and help set
up before going to school.

27:22.159 --> 27:24.839
Right now he's helping us design
a website for the centre.

27:24.879 --> 27:26.560
The police want to speak to you.

27:26.600 --> 27:29.439
I was just heading off.
No, we won't keep you long, pet.

27:29.479 --> 27:32.159
Just wanted a chat about your
relationship with Molly.

27:32.200 --> 27:35.479
He has no time for relationships.
He's far too busy with his studies.

27:35.519 --> 27:39.479
Molly and me are friends.
Now, your headmaster

27:39.519 --> 27:42.159
thinks you'd like it to be
a bit more than that.

27:43.360 --> 27:45.600
Says you've got quite the crush.

27:46.600 --> 27:50.759
That must have been hard, you feeling
the way you do about the lass.

27:50.800 --> 27:54.000
And then her mam disapproving of you
like that.

27:54.039 --> 27:56.560
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

27:56.600 --> 28:01.959
Mrs Glenn complained to the school
about Sahil's obsession with Molly.
Obsession? That's ridiculous.

28:02.720 --> 28:04.879
He's known the girl
most of his life.

28:04.920 --> 28:06.839
I had no problem with Mrs Glenn.

28:06.879 --> 28:10.560
Even though she was trying to get
Molly moved out of your class?

28:10.600 --> 28:12.800
There was nothing I could do about
that.

28:12.839 --> 28:17.119
Could have talked to her.
I didn't. Why not?
Because I wasn't that bothered.

28:17.159 --> 28:20.079
When did you last see Mrs Glenn?
Can't remember.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.439
Did you see her the night she died?

28:25.479 --> 28:29.400
Sahil was with me all night,
and neither of us left the house.

28:29.439 --> 28:31.879
I don't know where you're getting
all of this from.

28:31.920 --> 28:34.800
Sahil's a good boy.
And now he's late for school.

28:42.280 --> 28:45.319
That lad's got a lot of anger.
Aye. As does his mam.

28:45.360 --> 28:48.439
Do you think she's covering for him?
I think she would if she had to.

28:49.439 --> 28:52.639
Here you are. Kenny's got something
for us.

28:52.680 --> 28:54.079
Right...

28:55.400 --> 28:58.319
Michael Glenn lied. Again.

28:58.360 --> 29:02.360
Barman at the Admiral confirmed
Jason and Michael arrived at 7:30,

29:02.400 --> 29:05.839
but Michael left at 9:00. Said
he didn't return till last orders.

29:05.879 --> 29:08.000
But we've got a cab driver
that picked him up

29:08.039 --> 29:10.439
and dropped him off at an address
in South Shields.

29:13.200 --> 29:16.400
Audrey Latham.
She's registered to the address.

29:16.439 --> 29:19.600
Michael's still at his brother's
flat. I can pick him up. No.

29:19.639 --> 29:23.039
Let's go and talk to this Audrey
first before we talk to Michael.

29:23.079 --> 29:24.800
Come on.

29:25.680 --> 29:27.400
(Knocking on door)

29:29.519 --> 29:31.239
Audrey Latham?
Yes?

29:33.000 --> 29:35.519
No, pet. Never seen him before.

29:36.439 --> 29:38.879
Are you sure about that?

29:38.920 --> 29:44.319
Only, we've a witness says this fella
visited you two nights ago,

29:44.360 --> 29:47.280
in the evening, about 10:00.

29:47.319 --> 29:49.519
No, pet. Nobody visits me.

29:49.560 --> 29:52.879
Unless you count the health visitor,
but she's not been round in weeks.

29:52.920 --> 29:55.079
What about the name? Michael Glenn?

29:56.959 --> 29:58.159
(Inhales)

29:59.280 --> 30:02.000
I knew a Joyce Glenn.
We were good friends,

30:02.039 --> 30:03.959
but she emigrated way back.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.200
Lives in Canada now.
Least, I think she does.

30:06.239 --> 30:09.000
Anybody else live here?
Just me.

30:09.039 --> 30:11.319
Husband?

30:12.079 --> 30:14.079
He's up there, love.

30:15.239 --> 30:16.639
Oh.

30:18.159 --> 30:19.839
So, two nights ago,

30:19.879 --> 30:21.879
a fella did not come here?

30:21.920 --> 30:23.920
Even if he had, I wouldn't have let
him in.

30:24.879 --> 30:26.879
Can't be letting strange men
in here.

30:27.759 --> 30:29.759
I'd get myself a reputation.

30:34.039 --> 30:36.079
Tried a few doors down the street.

30:36.119 --> 30:39.079
Nobody had a visit from Michael
Glenn. Never even heard of him.

30:40.720 --> 30:43.119
What was he doing out here?

30:43.159 --> 30:45.000
Maybe he liked the view.

30:45.039 --> 30:47.119
It was dark. There was no view.

30:48.479 --> 30:51.000
Talk to that cab driver again,

30:51.039 --> 30:53.119
make sure he gave us
the right address.

30:55.439 --> 30:57.639
And check out Audrey too,

30:57.680 --> 31:02.159
see if there's any connection at all
to Michael Glenn.

31:02.200 --> 31:04.479
And in the meantime,
I'll talk to him again.

31:05.239 --> 31:07.239
(Vehicle pulls up)

31:11.479 --> 31:15.119
What time was that?
I'll be there as soon as I can.

31:16.920 --> 31:19.879
That's Molly. She's in hospital.
What's happened?

31:19.920 --> 31:22.439
I dunno. Michael's in a state.

31:23.439 --> 31:25.159
Well, come on. I'll give you a lift.

31:25.200 --> 31:28.600
I need to talk to your brother
anyway.

31:28.639 --> 31:30.639
Alcohol poisoning.

31:30.680 --> 31:34.280
Police found her collapsed in the
town centre.

31:34.319 --> 31:37.200
Drank her weight in vodka
and they had to pump her stomach.

31:37.239 --> 31:38.400
Bloody hell!

31:38.439 --> 31:41.400
Has she ever done anything like that
before?

31:41.439 --> 31:43.079
Normally I'd say no.

31:43.119 --> 31:46.280
But ever since she's been hanging
around with Sahil...

31:46.319 --> 31:48.519
Sahil was with her? Aye.

31:48.560 --> 31:52.560
Till the police turned up.
Then he ran off ands left her
like a bloody coward.

31:52.600 --> 31:56.239
I need to go and see her.
Aye. We'll look after Elliot.

31:58.720 --> 32:00.639
What the hell was she thinking?

32:00.680 --> 32:03.439
Should be grieving her mam, not
going out, getting smashed out of
her head.

32:03.479 --> 32:05.400
Well, maybe that is her grieving.

32:05.439 --> 32:09.720
Yeah. She should be thinking about
Michael, trying to help HIM.

32:10.680 --> 32:13.759
Is that what YOU were doing
when we last spoke?

32:13.800 --> 32:17.879
Cos yesterday you told me both of you
were in the pub all night.

32:19.360 --> 32:24.560
Elliot, mate, um, why don't you gan
and get yourself some chocolate?

32:24.600 --> 32:26.479
The machine's just over there.

32:30.000 --> 32:35.680
Right, he might have popped out for
a bit. Oh, it's more than a bit,
love.

32:35.720 --> 32:40.600
I've got a cab driver, tells me
he took him down to South Shields

32:40.639 --> 32:43.560
and brought him back too.

32:43.600 --> 32:47.200
Said Michael didn't get to the pub
until almost closing time.

32:48.159 --> 32:49.639
I didn't notice.

32:49.680 --> 32:51.839
You didn't notice your own brother

32:51.879 --> 32:53.639
leaving the pub for three hours?

32:53.680 --> 32:58.319
Look, if you want to know
where he was, go and ask HIM.

32:58.360 --> 33:00.079
Jason.

33:14.280 --> 33:17.280
Oh... Let me guess.

33:17.319 --> 33:21.239
It's eaten your money.
It didn't drop.

33:27.239 --> 33:29.439
There you go.

33:32.439 --> 33:35.000
You didn't see that. (Chuckles)

33:41.639 --> 33:44.119
Where's Mam?

33:49.079 --> 33:52.639
Hey, your mam...

33:52.680 --> 33:54.560
She's with a friend of mine.

33:55.560 --> 33:58.600
And he's going to find out
why she died.

33:59.319 --> 34:01.519
So your friend's a pathologist?

34:01.560 --> 34:05.239
Yeah, she is. And you're a very
bright young man.

34:05.280 --> 34:08.039
They don't think I am.
They think I'm stupid.

34:08.079 --> 34:10.039
Won't tell me anything.

34:10.079 --> 34:14.439
Just give me chocolate.
(Giggles)

34:14.479 --> 34:17.200
Well, anything you wanna know, just
ask me.

34:17.239 --> 34:19.439
I'll tell you, if I can.

34:21.519 --> 34:23.280
Is it bad to break a promise?

34:24.239 --> 34:26.239
Well, that depends.

34:26.280 --> 34:29.519
On what?
Well, on why you're breaking it.

34:29.560 --> 34:33.959
I mean, sometimes, you have to, don't
you? Cos that's the right thing to
do.

34:38.319 --> 34:40.000
There was a man.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.600
What man?

34:43.639 --> 34:45.639
The day before Mam died.

34:46.759 --> 34:50.759
Big shop near the house.
He frightened her.

34:50.800 --> 34:54.119
As soon as Mam saw him, she went
white.

34:54.879 --> 34:56.839
I could feel her shaking.

34:59.879 --> 35:03.680
Whoever that fella was,
he scared the hell out of Alison.

35:04.759 --> 35:07.000
Elliot said they practically ran from
the shop.

35:09.360 --> 35:11.000
Excuse me, love.

35:11.039 --> 35:13.920
DCI Stanhope, Northumberland & City
Police.

35:13.959 --> 35:16.439
We need to see your CCTV footage.

35:16.479 --> 35:18.600
Can you organise that, love?
Of course.

35:21.439 --> 35:24.400
Looking for footage three days ago,
early afternoon.

35:24.439 --> 35:26.119
Mother and son.

35:34.280 --> 35:36.000
There you are. That's Alison.

35:42.360 --> 35:44.519
Here we go.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.360
Stop it there!

36:07.319 --> 36:09.159
ROBERT: I've already told you.

36:09.200 --> 36:12.639
We haven't seen her in over 25
years.

36:12.680 --> 36:17.400
Well, maybe you haven't seen her,
but Tom saw Alison last week

36:17.439 --> 36:20.360
while he was doing a bit of shopping.

36:26.560 --> 36:29.200
What is this?

36:33.720 --> 36:36.039
I asked you a question.

36:40.360 --> 36:41.959
I'm sorry, Dad.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
You stupid, little...
(Grunts)

36:44.039 --> 36:47.200
(Shouting)
Hey, hey! Mr Naresby, that's enough,
sir!

36:47.239 --> 36:49.200
That's enough!
(Grunts)

36:49.239 --> 36:53.680
Come on, this way.
(Grunts) He's my son! Get off me!

36:53.720 --> 36:55.920
Get your hands off me!

36:56.959 --> 36:58.560
I need you to keep calm, sir.

36:58.600 --> 37:00.600
You can't speak to him on his own.

37:00.639 --> 37:02.920
He doesn't know what he's saying,
man.

37:05.400 --> 37:08.879
Tom, are you going to sit up and talk
to me?

37:11.039 --> 37:12.839
It's all right, pet. He's gone now.

37:15.239 --> 37:19.439
See, I think you went to see Alison
just to say hello.

37:20.479 --> 37:24.639
After all, she was your big sister,
wasn't she, mm?

37:25.680 --> 37:30.959
And you hadn't seen each other
in, well, a long while.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.839
But what I don't get, though...

37:35.519 --> 37:37.720
..is how did you know where she was?

37:40.319 --> 37:44.519
I saw a picture. I found it
at the swimming pool.

37:44.560 --> 37:47.079
I go there every Tuesday.

37:48.920 --> 37:50.959
Terry...

37:51.000 --> 37:54.680
my key worker...he takes me.

38:00.560 --> 38:04.720
Well, you've got a sharp eye.

38:11.319 --> 38:13.039
How did you get there?

38:14.600 --> 38:18.119
I-I...I took a bus.

38:20.839 --> 38:23.280
I took two buses.

38:23.319 --> 38:24.959
Did you?

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
Yeah.

38:30.079 --> 38:32.119
Did you see Alison?

38:33.039 --> 38:35.039
So what did you do?

38:36.639 --> 38:40.079
I wanted juice,
so I went to the shop.

38:40.119 --> 38:44.000
The big one that I saw
when I got off the bus, the 31.

38:47.079 --> 38:49.079
And when I was there, I...

38:50.200 --> 38:51.959
..I saw Alison.

38:53.039 --> 38:55.039
And the boy.

38:56.079 --> 38:58.879
His name's Elliot.
Yeah.

39:01.200 --> 39:03.200
Well, I saw them...

39:04.439 --> 39:06.280
..and I said...

39:07.319 --> 39:09.759
'Hello, Alison, it's me.'

39:14.319 --> 39:16.639
But she didn't say hello back.

39:20.239 --> 39:24.479
She just turned away and left.

39:27.400 --> 39:30.159
I think she was angry with me.

39:32.400 --> 39:34.400
So what did you do then?

39:37.720 --> 39:39.720
I just came home.

39:46.280 --> 39:48.280
I still miss her.

39:50.519 --> 39:52.519
Aye, I know you do, pet.

39:57.079 --> 40:00.600
Listen, speak to social services
again.

40:00.639 --> 40:03.560
See if we can talk to whoever worked
with Tom

40:03.600 --> 40:06.079
when he was a lad,
when Alison was still at home.

40:06.119 --> 40:09.360
That's over 20 years ago.
I wanna know why she left.

40:09.400 --> 40:11.680
Sometimes, kids just run away.

40:11.720 --> 40:15.239
Aye, and maybe they lie a bit
about where they're from,

40:15.280 --> 40:17.519
but that's not what Alison Glenn did.

40:17.560 --> 40:21.759
She told everyone she loved
she was an orphan.

40:22.800 --> 40:26.439
She erased her family,
wiped them off the board.

40:27.600 --> 40:29.600
And that's a different kind of lie.

40:32.200 --> 40:35.200
That's angry. That's emotional.

40:36.400 --> 40:38.400
And that's cold.

40:38.439 --> 40:40.239
Get us another one, pet.

40:40.280 --> 40:42.079
It was £1.20.

40:42.119 --> 40:45.119
They'll change it.
Not rushed off their feet, are they?

40:46.159 --> 40:48.159
(Door opens, then closes)

40:48.200 --> 40:51.600
You've done, then?
Report's behind you.

40:51.639 --> 40:53.239
Anything we don't already know?

40:53.280 --> 40:57.600
She died from a massive trauma
caused by a blow to the back of
the skull.

40:57.639 --> 41:00.079
Time of death:
between ten and four on the night.

41:00.119 --> 41:02.119
So that'll be a no, then.

41:04.319 --> 41:07.319
It says here, 'Evidence of historical
scarring'.

41:08.119 --> 41:11.119
Yeah, on her wrists. They've long
since healed.

41:14.400 --> 41:16.200
How old are the scars?

41:16.239 --> 41:18.319
20 years, maybe more.

41:23.039 --> 41:28.239
Alison Glenn made an attempt on her
own life
sometime in her late teens.

41:28.280 --> 41:34.000
Now, something happened on that
Naresby farm
and I want to know what it was.

41:34.039 --> 41:36.920
Maybe Chris Harwen can tell us.
Who's Chris Harwen?

41:36.959 --> 41:38.920
He's the social worker you asked me
to find.

41:38.959 --> 41:41.680
The one assigned to Tom Naresby
when Alison was at home.

41:41.720 --> 41:43.839
Well, set me up with a meeting today.

41:44.879 --> 41:46.560
Red hatchback, how are we doing?

41:46.600 --> 41:49.519
No-one on the Larchford Estate
has a car matching that.

41:49.560 --> 41:52.959
And none of our suspects do either.
Traffic cameras?

41:53.000 --> 41:55.959
Nearest one's a mile away,
but without the registration...

41:56.000 --> 41:58.800
Ma'am, I've got something here,
though. What?

41:58.839 --> 42:02.319
A cache of deleted emails
we found on Alison Glenn's laptop.

42:02.360 --> 42:06.439
There's probably about 20 or so,
all of them sent in the last month.

42:06.479 --> 42:11.119
But the last one, this one here,
was sent on the night
she was killed.

42:11.159 --> 42:14.439
Most of them are just abusive,
but this one ups the ante.

42:15.239 --> 42:19.000
'I'll make sure that mouth of yours
is shut for good.' Do we know who
sent this?

42:19.039 --> 42:22.560
Email account's fake.
What about the IP address?

42:22.600 --> 42:25.360
They're working on it.
Well, tell 'em to work faster.

42:25.400 --> 42:27.400
Ma'am.

42:41.200 --> 42:43.879
Quite the career change, Mr Harwen.

42:43.920 --> 42:45.920
I'm all the happier for it.

42:48.119 --> 42:50.119
What made you leave social work?

42:50.159 --> 42:52.159
It wasn't for me.

42:52.200 --> 42:57.039
I was young. Too much of an
idealist. Thought I could make
a difference.

42:57.079 --> 43:01.360
It's families like the Naresbys
proved to me
I could never change anything.

43:01.400 --> 43:05.680
How long were you with them?
About eight months, all in.

43:05.720 --> 43:09.039
I joined the department in...1990.
Mm.

43:09.079 --> 43:11.159
Tom Naresby was one of my first
clients.

43:11.200 --> 43:14.920
What about Alison?
I didn't have much to do with her.

43:14.959 --> 43:18.400
But you remember her, though.
I remember she was quiet.

43:18.439 --> 43:20.439
Tom was very attached to her.

43:20.479 --> 43:22.920
He'd have taken her death very hard.

43:22.959 --> 43:24.439
Mm.

43:26.759 --> 43:30.879
Our pathologist thinks Alison tried
to kill herself.

43:30.920 --> 43:33.759
God! Really?
Mm.

43:33.800 --> 43:35.400
When?
Oh, way back.

43:35.439 --> 43:38.680
Round about the time you were with
them. I had no idea.

43:38.720 --> 43:41.720
Did you ever get a sense she was
unhappy?

43:42.560 --> 43:45.479
No, I mean, to be honest,
I was so focused on Tom,

43:45.519 --> 43:48.280
I never really paid Alison that much
attention.

43:48.319 --> 43:50.119
She ran away. Did you know that?

43:50.159 --> 43:53.639
Well, that was after my time.
I only found out
through a colleague.

43:53.680 --> 43:55.280
I didn't have to ask.

43:56.319 --> 43:58.439
Her father would have driven her
away.

44:00.959 --> 44:06.079
Mark, have you got that IP address?
Yeah, matches with the Larchford Day
Centre.

44:06.119 --> 44:09.639
Those emails came from there?
Are you sure about that?

44:09.680 --> 44:11.280
Positive.

44:13.159 --> 44:17.319
The emails came from here, traced to
the computer in your office.

44:17.360 --> 44:21.479
Well, people come and go in there
all the time.
Anyone could've sent them.

44:21.519 --> 44:26.039
Oh, I see. So all the old codgers
have access to the office, do they?

44:26.079 --> 44:28.639
They all know
how to make false email accounts

44:28.680 --> 44:32.079
and I suppose they've all got
a grudge against Alison Glenn!

44:32.119 --> 44:36.519
No, of course they haven't,
so that leaves you and your son.

44:39.680 --> 44:44.560
You have to understand, Sahil's been
having a hard time recently.

44:44.600 --> 44:48.200
Because Alison didn't want him
hanging around with Molly?

44:48.239 --> 44:50.879
I don't know what he sees in that
girl.

44:50.920 --> 44:54.519
She's trouble. Alison didn't know
half the stuff she got up to.

44:54.560 --> 44:57.159
You think yesterday's
drunk episode was a one-off?

44:57.200 --> 44:59.360
It's nothing to what that girl's
capable of.

45:00.639 --> 45:03.400
But, yes, he does have feelings for
her.

45:03.439 --> 45:05.759
He's a very sensitive boy.

45:06.680 --> 45:10.039
Well, there wasn't much sensitivity
in those emails he sent to her mam.

45:10.079 --> 45:14.639
He didn't mean anything by them,
he was lashing out. It wasn't
serious.

45:15.560 --> 45:17.039
Where is Sahil?

45:17.920 --> 45:20.479
At home. He's not feeling very well.

45:20.519 --> 45:23.920
Right, well, I'll have Uniform pick
him up, bring him to the station.

45:23.959 --> 45:25.759
The station? You can't arrest him!

45:25.800 --> 45:30.119
Look, love, you're welcome
to come down and wait for him.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Watch your head.

45:43.239 --> 45:46.720
Ah, your mam tells me you're feeling
under the weather, Sahil.

45:47.759 --> 45:50.920
Still, don't suppose
you're feeling as bad as Molly does.

45:52.319 --> 45:56.000
Ooh! Her dad's not impressed with
you, getting his daughter drunk.

45:56.039 --> 45:59.639
I didn't get her drunk.
I was trying to get her home safe.

45:59.680 --> 46:02.879
Then, why did you abandon her?
She told me to leave.

46:05.200 --> 46:08.400
Said she didn't wanna hang around
with us any more.

46:08.439 --> 46:12.519
How did that make you feel?
Fine. Better off out of it.

46:12.560 --> 46:16.680
She's always getting us into
trouble. You do a good job of that
yourself, mate.

46:16.720 --> 46:19.479
Everyone wants to paint me
as this troublemaker.

46:19.519 --> 46:21.319
Guess it's easier.

46:21.360 --> 46:24.519
But the truth is, I haven't done
half the things they say I've done.

46:24.560 --> 46:26.360
No?

46:27.479 --> 46:29.079
Well, how about...

46:29.920 --> 46:33.519
..sending abusive emails?

46:33.560 --> 46:34.920
Mm?

46:35.959 --> 46:37.959
Loads of 'em.

46:38.000 --> 46:42.400
They were sent to Molly's mam
from the computer at the day centre.

46:42.439 --> 46:47.720
Now, whoever sent these definitely
had a problem with Alison Glenn.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.600
Did you send 'em?

47:00.920 --> 47:04.560
OK, Sahil. You don't wanna talk.

47:05.839 --> 47:07.439
It's OK.

47:07.479 --> 47:13.239
Just so you know, there's an officer
at your house at the moment going
through your things.

47:14.280 --> 47:16.560
OK. I sent them.

47:16.600 --> 47:18.519
It was me.

47:23.239 --> 47:25.360
Why did you send 'em?
Don't know.

47:26.400 --> 47:29.720
Was it because of you and Molly, hm?

47:30.759 --> 47:33.720
And because Alison interfered?
It was none of her business.

47:33.759 --> 47:36.479
Course it's her business, Molly's her
daughter.

47:36.519 --> 47:39.920
That's what mams do.
They look out for their kids.

47:40.959 --> 47:45.239
And let's face it, she was right
to be concerned about you, wasn't
she,

47:45.280 --> 47:48.879
if you were sending these?
Look, I sent them, all right?
I've admitted it.

47:48.920 --> 47:51.720
So why don't you just do
whatever it is you need to do?

47:54.600 --> 47:57.200
I can't work him out.
What's there to work out?

47:57.239 --> 47:58.920
The lad's got a temper. He's
violent.

47:58.959 --> 48:03.400
Yeah, but he's got it bad for that
lass and I just cannae see him doing
anything to hurt her.

48:03.439 --> 48:04.839
Mm.

48:05.479 --> 48:07.400
Anyway, moot point.

48:07.439 --> 48:10.039
If his mum says he was at home that
night...

48:10.680 --> 48:13.000
Mm.

48:13.039 --> 48:16.039
Talking of alibis, did you do any
digging into that Audrey Latham?

48:16.079 --> 48:18.039
Nothing. No connection to Michael
Glenn.

48:19.079 --> 48:23.639
Although, interestingly enough,
our Audrey was a casino croupier.

48:23.680 --> 48:26.280
Ooh! (Giggles)

48:26.319 --> 48:28.319
Place your bets.

48:31.119 --> 48:32.720
Which one?

48:32.759 --> 48:34.239
What?

48:34.280 --> 48:37.680
Which casino?
A Regal, I think. Closed now.

48:39.119 --> 48:41.439
Aiden, get my coat.
Why?

48:42.479 --> 48:44.479
We're going out.

48:47.200 --> 48:50.720
The Regal Casino was owned by Brian
Delaney.

48:50.759 --> 48:53.200
Fancied himself as a crime lord.

48:53.239 --> 48:55.680
Dealt mainly in drugs and gambling...

48:56.600 --> 48:58.119
..but he was forced out by a rival.

48:58.159 --> 49:01.200
A rival that he took care of.

49:04.280 --> 49:06.439
So Delaney's a murderer?

49:06.479 --> 49:08.560
Aye, and guess which prison he's in?

49:12.959 --> 49:14.560
How's she doing?

49:15.319 --> 49:18.519
They kept her in overnight.
Precaution.

49:19.200 --> 49:21.800
They're giving her
the 'dangers of alcohol' speech now.

49:23.600 --> 49:25.759
We need to have a little chat,
Michael.

49:25.800 --> 49:30.800
Look, I've heard that speech. It goes
on for months. You've got time. Come
on.

49:31.720 --> 49:33.800
What's the problem?

49:33.839 --> 49:37.680
Well, the problem is Brian Delaney.

49:39.239 --> 49:41.239
Wanna tell us about him?

49:48.319 --> 49:50.519
It's not what you think it is.

49:50.560 --> 49:52.639
Well, why don't you tell me
what it is?

49:54.800 --> 49:59.159
A few months back,
Jason got himself into trouble.

49:59.200 --> 50:02.519
What sort of trouble?
Debt, a lot of it.

50:02.560 --> 50:05.119
He owed Delaney?

50:05.159 --> 50:07.720
I couldn't help him,
we didn't have that sort of money.

50:07.759 --> 50:12.400
So, anyway, one day, Delaney gets
word to me in prison. Makes me an
offer.

50:13.439 --> 50:15.920
A chance to work off Jason's debt
fast, like.

50:15.959 --> 50:17.959
You were smuggling for him?

50:18.000 --> 50:21.439
Well, nothing that isn't going
in and out of Greenpoint on a daily
basis.

50:21.479 --> 50:23.879
So why use Audrey Latham?
It was Delaney's idea.

50:23.920 --> 50:26.159
I told him I didn't want to deal
with any of his goons.

50:26.200 --> 50:28.159
What happened the other night?

50:28.200 --> 50:29.959
Delaney changed the game.

50:30.000 --> 50:34.119
I thought I was picking up phones.
Instead, Audrey, she hands over
drugs.

50:35.159 --> 50:38.720
Not even sure what it was, but I
wasn't interested and I walked out.

50:38.759 --> 50:41.959
You should have told us this before,
Mr Glenn.

50:42.839 --> 50:44.839
This is not connected to Alison.

50:48.200 --> 50:50.400
Not connected?

50:50.439 --> 50:53.159
You backed out of a deal
you made with a known criminal,

50:53.200 --> 50:57.560
and not just any criminal - Brian
Delaney -

50:57.600 --> 51:01.839
and a few hours later, your wife is
dead.

51:03.720 --> 51:05.079
Not connected...

51:06.119 --> 51:08.200
You should've told us, Michael.

51:16.759 --> 51:18.759
(Police radio)

51:20.959 --> 51:22.560
You must've found something.

51:22.600 --> 51:24.479
Of course they haven't.

51:24.519 --> 51:28.639
Audrey, where are they?
Where's what?

51:29.680 --> 51:31.479
Why are you doing this?

51:31.519 --> 51:34.959
Come on, Audrey.
Delaney get 'em picked up, did he?

51:35.000 --> 51:37.360
Who's Delaney?

51:37.400 --> 51:41.280
The fella...who's waiting for these.

51:50.879 --> 51:52.839
I've no idea how they got there.

51:52.879 --> 51:55.800
Oh, Audrey, love...
I'm telling you.

51:55.839 --> 52:00.360
What do I need with pills, other
than the ones that the doctor gave
me for my heart?

52:00.400 --> 52:03.159
Oh, that's enough!

52:03.200 --> 52:05.680
Now, you've put on a good show, pet,
I'll give you that,

52:05.720 --> 52:08.560
but don't test my patience.

52:08.600 --> 52:11.039
Do you understand me?

52:12.079 --> 52:13.680
Good.

52:15.200 --> 52:17.720
Now, when did Delaney contact you?

52:19.479 --> 52:21.119
A couple of months back.

52:21.959 --> 52:25.000
He sent a lad round.
I don't know his name.

52:25.039 --> 52:28.079
And he wanted you to act as
a go-between, is that right?

52:28.119 --> 52:29.959
Pass stuff to Michael Glenn.

52:30.000 --> 52:33.200
They'd drop it off in the morning
and he'd come and collect it later.

52:34.439 --> 52:36.119
I needed the money, pet.

52:37.479 --> 52:42.119
20 years I worked those tables
and in the end, I came out with
nothing.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.600
I thought it was just phones.

52:45.639 --> 52:51.479
It wasn't just phones though, was
it? Now listen, the other night,

52:51.519 --> 52:56.319
when Michael refused to pick up those
pills, what did you do?

52:57.360 --> 52:58.639
Nothing.

52:58.680 --> 53:00.920
He just left.

53:00.959 --> 53:02.720
Did you make a call?

53:05.639 --> 53:09.759
Audrey, did you call Delaney?

53:13.200 --> 53:14.759
(Inhales sharply)

53:14.800 --> 53:20.759
Audrey Latham made a call to
an unregistered number at 11:10
the night Alison was killed.

53:20.800 --> 53:23.839
She called Delaney in prison

53:23.879 --> 53:26.959
just after Michael Glenn left
her house.

53:27.000 --> 53:30.000
Delaney phone anyone after that?
We're checking his call history.

53:30.039 --> 53:32.959
So we're saying he arranged a hit
on Michael Glenn's wife?

53:33.000 --> 53:35.239
He's got the contacts.
Aye, but even so,

53:35.280 --> 53:38.879
why go after the wife of a prison
officer? To make Michael co-operate?

53:38.920 --> 53:42.839
Yeah, but killing his wife's hardly
gonna make him toe the line, is it?

53:44.400 --> 53:47.800
And he'd have no trouble finding
someone else to bring the drugs in.

53:50.239 --> 53:54.319
This just doesn't look like Delaney's
work. Too messy.

53:55.360 --> 53:58.920
Kenny, see if you can get hold of
Delaney's solicitor.

53:59.959 --> 54:04.360
It's a long shot, but let's see if
Delaney'll grant us an interview.

54:04.400 --> 54:06.200
Will do.

54:06.239 --> 54:08.360
Ma'am, you're gonna want to hear
this.

54:08.400 --> 54:12.000
A search team's been through
Sahil Dabra's computer and phone.

54:12.039 --> 54:15.319
They didn't find any more emails,
but they did find this.

54:15.360 --> 54:19.159
A message left on his voicemail,
9:50, night of the murder.

54:19.200 --> 54:23.319
MOLLY: It's me. I'm not going back.
I can't live with her.

54:23.360 --> 54:27.200
I'm done with her. I'm gone. Call
me, Sahil. (Car horns honking)

54:28.119 --> 54:30.319
That's traffic noise in the
background.

54:32.239 --> 54:34.239
You told me you were in bed.

54:35.319 --> 54:38.000
I went out for a walk.
Ah, nice try.

54:39.239 --> 54:41.039
(Exhales) OK.

54:42.119 --> 54:43.920
I went to see a friend.

54:43.959 --> 54:46.360
Now, why didn't you tell us this
before?

54:46.400 --> 54:49.800
Didn't think it mattered.
Ah, come on.

54:49.839 --> 54:51.839
You're smarter than that, love.

54:55.600 --> 54:57.600
What were you arguing about?

54:57.639 --> 54:59.360
Hm?

55:01.720 --> 55:03.720
Must have been about something.

55:05.439 --> 55:07.239
She, er...

55:09.119 --> 55:11.200
She found some photos on my phone.

55:12.039 --> 55:16.280
It was a party. I'd being drinking
at it.
And your mam gave you hell?

55:16.319 --> 55:17.759
Quite right too.

55:17.800 --> 55:19.800
She wouldn't let up.

55:19.839 --> 55:22.720
I had to get out so, after tea,
I sneaked out.

55:22.759 --> 55:26.119
What time did you get back?
About 11.

55:27.159 --> 55:28.920
And what did your mam say?

55:28.959 --> 55:33.000
I got back in the same way I got
out, so she didn't know I was gone.

55:33.039 --> 55:35.879
So you didn't see your mam at all?

55:36.920 --> 55:38.800
No.

55:40.639 --> 55:42.200
But I could hear her.

55:43.519 --> 55:45.839
She was in the kitchen, loading the
dishwasher.

55:45.879 --> 55:48.680
Now I wish I'd gone downstairs.

55:49.879 --> 55:54.239
I wish I'd gone down there and
screamed at her.

55:56.280 --> 55:58.079
Called her for everything.

55:59.280 --> 56:01.720
I wish I'd told her I hated her...

56:04.319 --> 56:06.920
..cos, then, she might still be
here.

56:06.959 --> 56:08.959
(Sobs)

56:14.280 --> 56:16.360
Now, you're not in any trouble,
pet...

56:18.000 --> 56:22.239
..but I am going to need
two things from you, OK?

56:24.600 --> 56:28.639
First, no more lies. Is that
understood?

56:28.680 --> 56:30.439
(Sniffs)

56:32.239 --> 56:34.920
And then I want the name of your
friend.

56:38.639 --> 56:41.560
Project out your voices to the back,
OK? OK. Thank you.

56:41.600 --> 56:44.119
So do you wanna take the place down
there? Yeah.

56:45.159 --> 56:48.119
OK. Right, let's go through it
again.

56:55.280 --> 56:57.519
Yes, Molly came to see me.

56:57.560 --> 56:59.560
At your home?

56:59.600 --> 57:02.200
Now, why didn't you tell us this
before?

57:02.239 --> 57:05.000
Honestly, I was worried about how it
looked.

57:05.039 --> 57:08.920
A pupil turning up at my flat
in the middle of the night.

57:08.959 --> 57:10.839
Aye, and not just any pupil.

57:10.879 --> 57:14.519
The daughter of a murder victim
who happens to be with you

57:14.560 --> 57:16.200
the night her mam is killed.

57:16.239 --> 57:18.560
You're right, and I am sorry.

57:19.600 --> 57:21.360
Why did she come to see you?

57:21.400 --> 57:23.200
She'd had an argument with her mam.

57:23.239 --> 57:25.280
Aye, but why did she come to YOU?

57:25.319 --> 57:28.519
The past few weeks, we've been
working on the show together.

57:28.560 --> 57:30.720
We got to know each other,
I suppose.

57:32.639 --> 57:34.839
So what happened when she turned up?

57:34.879 --> 57:38.319
Well, I told her she couldn't stay
and then I called her a taxi.

57:38.360 --> 57:41.119
That time of night,
why didn't YOU drive her home?

57:41.159 --> 57:44.479
Because I don't drive.
My husband does, but he was working.

57:46.839 --> 57:49.879
And even if I did,
I wouldn't have taken Molly home.

57:49.920 --> 57:51.519
Why not?

57:53.039 --> 57:55.439
Mrs Glenn was very protective of
her.

57:56.439 --> 57:58.639
I doubt she would have enjoyed my
involvement.

57:58.680 --> 58:01.000
You were scared of her?

58:03.239 --> 58:05.239
Frankly, yeah.

58:06.319 --> 58:08.319
(Low chatter)

58:09.639 --> 58:13.200
How does Molly feel about Sahil?
How do you mean?

58:13.239 --> 58:18.439
Well, she called him
before she came round to yours,

58:18.479 --> 58:21.720
which suggests she didn't share
her mam's feelings about the boy.

58:22.759 --> 58:27.200
Well, Sahil can be intense, but, to
be honest, I think Molly likes him.

58:27.239 --> 58:29.400
So you don't see it as a problem?

58:29.439 --> 58:33.439
Well, I'm not condoning
his assault on another pupil,

58:33.479 --> 58:36.639
but Sahil has had a lot on his plate
recently.

58:36.680 --> 58:40.400
Ah, well, he can't be the only kid in
the school whose parents have
divorced.

58:40.439 --> 58:42.439
Oh, it's not just the divorce.

58:43.479 --> 58:45.479
Why, what else is there?

58:47.439 --> 58:51.720
AIDEN: Sahil's dad's going after
custody? Has been for the past year.

58:51.759 --> 58:53.839
Wants him to go and live with him in
London.

58:53.879 --> 58:56.600
He's a rich man. He could win his
case.

58:58.439 --> 59:00.600
What are you doing?
I'm doing my fish pie.

59:00.639 --> 59:04.600
Royal visit. Charlie's mum. She's
coming over for dinner tonight.

59:06.400 --> 59:10.400
How does Sahil feel about moving to
the big smoke with his dad?

59:10.439 --> 59:14.319
Well, he doesn't want to go. That's
why he's been acting up at school.

59:14.360 --> 59:16.600
Ah, it's just frustration.

59:16.639 --> 59:22.000
But the thing is, his dad's been
getting a weekly report from the
school.

59:22.039 --> 59:26.519
He wants to prove the lad's not
thriving under his mam's care.

59:26.560 --> 59:29.759
Now he's been arrested for sending
abusive emails to Alison Glenn.

59:29.800 --> 59:31.959
Well, they'll have a field day with
that.

59:32.000 --> 59:33.639
(Repetitive thudding)

59:33.680 --> 59:35.680
Sounds like a microwave special.

59:35.720 --> 59:37.319
Ah, what's wrong with that?

59:37.360 --> 59:39.839
It's easier than faffing about with
fish.

59:39.879 --> 59:44.639
Hey, believe me, I'm happy for the
fact. Anything to keep me out the
way of her and her mum.

59:44.680 --> 59:47.159
It can't be that bad.
You think?

59:47.200 --> 59:51.119
I'll have to sit there listening to
them sniping at one another the
whole night

59:51.159 --> 59:54.759
and then, when I do try and play
peacemaker, they close ranks and
start on me.

59:54.800 --> 59:58.200
Never get between my wife and her
mother.
She'll always stick up for her.

59:58.239 --> 1:00:00.560
(Doorbell)
She's here. I'd better go.

1:00:00.600 --> 1:00:02.600
All right. Good night.

1:00:18.439 --> 1:00:20.039
(Doorbell)

1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:33.000
You again.

1:00:34.119 --> 1:00:35.800
Sahil's in his room.

1:00:35.839 --> 1:00:39.039
He won't come out. His arrest was
traumatising.

1:00:40.879 --> 1:00:46.039
Tell me, do you enjoy destroying
young men's futures, DCI Stanhope?

1:00:46.079 --> 1:00:51.439
Well, I just came to let you know
we won't be pressing charges against
Sahil.

1:00:51.479 --> 1:00:54.959
Really? Why the change of heart?

1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:57.720
Because he didn't send the emails.

1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:02.280
Well, you've got to hand it to him.

1:01:02.319 --> 1:01:06.039
He did you proud, confessing.

1:01:07.079 --> 1:01:09.600
It was YOU who sent them.

1:01:09.639 --> 1:01:11.639
That's preposterous.

1:01:13.319 --> 1:01:18.800
Well... Alison was supposed to be
your friend, wasn't she?

1:01:19.839 --> 1:01:24.560
And yet she was always up at the
school, complaining about Sahil.

1:01:24.600 --> 1:01:29.119
Yeah, that must have hurt,
her going after your boy like that.

1:01:29.159 --> 1:01:33.479
Especially when she knew how hard
you were fighting your ex-husband for
custody.

1:01:34.519 --> 1:01:39.319
I asked her. I begged her to stop
going to the school, to come to me
about Sahil.

1:01:40.360 --> 1:01:43.000
But she kept going.

1:01:43.039 --> 1:01:45.879
You know, she wanted Karim to win.

1:01:45.920 --> 1:01:48.239
She wanted me to lose my son.

1:01:49.479 --> 1:01:51.680
I was so bloody angry with her,
I just...

1:01:51.720 --> 1:01:57.639
You just...sent death threats and
then sat back
and let Sahil take the blame.

1:01:57.680 --> 1:02:00.479
You threw your son under a bus, love.

1:02:00.519 --> 1:02:03.280
I had to. I couldn't admit to it.

1:02:03.319 --> 1:02:07.680
Karim's lawyers would have a field
day. I'd lose custody like that.

1:02:07.720 --> 1:02:09.439
Well, I don't fancy your chances now.

1:02:09.479 --> 1:02:12.000
He took everything from me when we
divorced...

1:02:13.280 --> 1:02:16.079
..and now he wants to take
the only thing that I've got left.

1:02:16.119 --> 1:02:18.000
Mum?

1:02:19.439 --> 1:02:23.439
Sahil, love. I'm sorry.

1:02:29.079 --> 1:02:30.879
It's OK, Mum.

1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:36.119
Sahil, you should've told us the
truth.

1:02:36.159 --> 1:02:38.159
I know, I'm sorry.

1:02:38.200 --> 1:02:41.280
I just didn't want my mam getting in
trouble, you know?

1:02:41.319 --> 1:02:43.119
Ah, I know.

1:02:43.159 --> 1:02:45.680
Will she? Get into trouble, I mean?

1:02:45.720 --> 1:02:47.959
Well, I'll do what I can, pet.

1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:51.400
Thanks.
But I want something in return.

1:02:52.439 --> 1:02:55.200
No more trouble at school, Sahil.

1:02:55.239 --> 1:02:57.239
Keep your head down, OK?

1:02:59.039 --> 1:03:01.079
Just causing your mam more grief.

1:03:02.800 --> 1:03:04.800
Go to bed.

1:03:17.839 --> 1:03:23.239
It's DCI Stanhope. I want a team
to 17 Clearmont Drive immediately.

1:03:50.079 --> 1:03:52.800
(Thud)
Stop! Police!

1:04:25.639 --> 1:04:26.839
(Thud)

1:04:26.879 --> 1:04:28.439
(Groans)

1:04:40.959 --> 1:04:44.479
TOM: Dad...he'll be angry.
He doesn't like it when I'm out.

1:04:44.519 --> 1:04:49.439
Ah, we'll get you home to your dad,
just as soon as we've finished our
little chat.

1:04:50.959 --> 1:04:54.600
So why did you go to Alison's house?

1:04:54.639 --> 1:04:57.119
I wanted to say hello to my family.

1:04:58.360 --> 1:05:00.959
The one you told Dad about.

1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:03.600
The little boy and girl.

1:05:04.639 --> 1:05:06.519
Cos I'm their uncle, see.

1:05:08.519 --> 1:05:12.000
I thought, if they met me
and they saw how nice I am, then...

1:05:13.959 --> 1:05:16.039
..maybe I could go and live with
them.

1:05:16.079 --> 1:05:19.759
Well, breaking into their house
wasn't very nice, was it?

1:05:20.959 --> 1:05:22.959
I didn't mean to.

1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:25.839
The glass just broke.

1:05:25.879 --> 1:05:29.079
Please, don't tell them it was me,
will you?

1:05:30.600 --> 1:05:33.039
Well, I'll try and keep it under my
hat, pet...

1:05:34.159 --> 1:05:36.519
..if you can answer me one last
question.

1:05:38.920 --> 1:05:42.239
How did you know where Alison lived?

1:05:45.159 --> 1:05:49.680
Cos when we spoke before, you said
you bumped into her in the
supermarket...

1:05:50.720 --> 1:05:53.800
..and then you said you didn't see
her any more after that.

1:05:58.280 --> 1:05:59.479
I followed her.

1:05:59.519 --> 1:06:02.039
You followed her.

1:06:04.920 --> 1:06:07.720
But why would he do it? Seems to me
that he doted on his sister.

1:06:07.759 --> 1:06:09.759
Ah, rush of blood?

1:06:10.560 --> 1:06:14.200
Had his heart set on joining her
family. She's having none of it.

1:06:14.239 --> 1:06:18.200
A big rejection for someone like him.
So what shall we do with him?

1:06:18.239 --> 1:06:21.200
We'll just have to keep him here
till we track down his dad.

1:06:21.239 --> 1:06:23.360
Hey! Spring in your step there,
Kenny.

1:06:23.400 --> 1:06:25.759
Aye. Delaney agreed to an interview.

1:06:40.119 --> 1:06:42.119
You must be DCI Stanhope.

1:06:43.200 --> 1:06:46.000
Well, thanks for agreeing to see me.
No need for thanks.

1:06:46.039 --> 1:06:49.479
We're all upset about Mr Glenn's
wife. Shocking.

1:06:49.519 --> 1:06:54.639
We know Michael Glenn was bringing in
contraband on your behalf.

1:06:54.680 --> 1:06:56.639
Says who?

1:06:56.680 --> 1:06:59.119
Well, him for one.

1:06:59.159 --> 1:07:01.560
And, ooh, Audrey Latham.

1:07:02.600 --> 1:07:05.720
Now there's a blast. (Chuckles)

1:07:05.759 --> 1:07:10.200
Always a handful, was Audrey.
Great girl, but you couldn't trust
a word she said.

1:07:11.159 --> 1:07:14.959
Ah, look, let's not pretend.
This place has problems.

1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:18.920
Like I say, things come in, things
go out. There's just no stopping it.

1:07:20.439 --> 1:07:24.680
But...I've never asked anyone
to bring in anything for me

1:07:24.720 --> 1:07:27.519
so, if that's why you're here, we're
all done.

1:07:27.560 --> 1:07:32.360
Audrey Latham called you on the night
that Alison Glenn was killed.

1:07:32.400 --> 1:07:35.159
I don't have a telephone.
Yes, you do, pet.

1:07:35.200 --> 1:07:38.920
The one you used
to co-ordinate your smuggling racket.

1:07:38.959 --> 1:07:42.200
Frankly, I don't care what you bring
in here,

1:07:42.239 --> 1:07:46.959
but I am interested in what you did
after Audrey's call.

1:07:49.479 --> 1:07:51.439
Now you're way off base.

1:07:51.479 --> 1:07:53.479
I know it's extreme...

1:07:54.519 --> 1:07:57.519
..but, then, you do have history,
Brian.

1:08:00.159 --> 1:08:01.839
I think we're finished here.

1:08:02.680 --> 1:08:06.479
I'll find out. We're checking your
call history as we speak.

1:08:10.119 --> 1:08:14.479
I tell you what, though, I feel
sorry for that poor sod Glenn.

1:08:14.519 --> 1:08:18.600
There he is waiting for justice and
you lot don't have a bloody clue.

1:08:19.280 --> 1:08:22.319
On top of that, his brother's
useless and his daughter's a drunk.

1:08:23.079 --> 1:08:25.079
I thought I had it bad.

1:08:32.159 --> 1:08:33.720
Thank you.

1:08:33.759 --> 1:08:36.280
Kenny got the call history on
Delaney's phone. And?

1:08:36.319 --> 1:08:40.039
Five minutes after Audrey called
him, he made an outgoing call to
another number.

1:08:40.079 --> 1:08:41.439
Guess who?

1:08:41.479 --> 1:08:42.680
Jason Glenn.

1:08:42.720 --> 1:08:45.239
Yeah. How did you know that?

1:08:46.959 --> 1:08:48.959
(Baby gurgling)

1:08:50.680 --> 1:08:52.680
Hello, love.

1:08:52.720 --> 1:08:54.720
They're not in.

1:08:56.400 --> 1:08:58.920
(Sighs) Any idea where they are?

1:08:58.959 --> 1:09:01.479
Beach Cafe. I just passed 'em.

1:09:01.519 --> 1:09:03.119
Thank you.

1:09:04.159 --> 1:09:06.800
He's a snake, you know.
I'll bet he hasn't told you.

1:09:06.839 --> 1:09:09.759
What's that?
She was round here a week ago.

1:09:09.800 --> 1:09:12.479
Who was?
His sister-in-law.

1:09:12.519 --> 1:09:15.839
Arguing about something.
Oh, the racket they made!

1:09:16.879 --> 1:09:20.280
Jason's sister-in-law was here?
Yeah.

1:09:20.319 --> 1:09:22.119
The woman in the papers.

1:09:23.159 --> 1:09:25.400
I've got to go.

1:09:30.800 --> 1:09:32.639
(Gulls crying)

1:09:33.680 --> 1:09:35.680
(Milk bubbling)

1:09:39.800 --> 1:09:41.920
I'll be back in a bit.

1:09:57.879 --> 1:10:00.079
Now's not the time.

1:10:00.119 --> 1:10:02.800
Alison, she came to your flat last
week. What did she want?

1:10:02.839 --> 1:10:05.720
I must have been out.
We're not stupid, pet.

1:10:05.759 --> 1:10:07.360
Your neighbour heard the row.

1:10:09.400 --> 1:10:11.600
Actually, you know what?

1:10:13.159 --> 1:10:15.159
I don't have to tell you what
she wanted.

1:10:18.720 --> 1:10:20.360
What did she want, Jason?

1:10:28.519 --> 1:10:30.119
All right, fine.

1:10:30.159 --> 1:10:32.959
I was gonna tell you,
but you've had a lot on, so...

1:10:34.959 --> 1:10:38.879
Alison came by.
She wanted to talk to me about you.

1:10:39.920 --> 1:10:41.600
We had some words.

1:10:42.639 --> 1:10:44.759
What did she want?

1:10:44.800 --> 1:10:48.560
Well, I'm guessing she found out
you were working for Delaney.

1:10:49.519 --> 1:10:51.920
Your wife was a smart woman.

1:10:51.959 --> 1:10:54.039
Knew you only too well.

1:10:57.479 --> 1:11:00.519
Did Alison know? She thought I had
something to do with it.

1:11:00.560 --> 1:11:02.280
Thought I could stop it.

1:11:03.319 --> 1:11:07.319
I told her it wasn't me, Michael.
I told her it was between you and
Delaney.

1:11:09.360 --> 1:11:11.759
I've never even met the man.
No.

1:11:11.800 --> 1:11:14.560
You have spoken to him, though,
haven't you, pet?

1:11:15.600 --> 1:11:19.000
He called you the night Alison died.
Now, what did he want?

1:11:20.680 --> 1:11:22.119
Nothing.

1:11:22.159 --> 1:11:24.600
He wou... He wouldn't call you
unless he had a reason.

1:11:25.639 --> 1:11:28.319
OK, look, he knew that...

1:11:28.360 --> 1:11:30.720
He knew that you'd backed out
and erm...and was livid

1:11:30.759 --> 1:11:33.400
and he wanted me to...
he wanted me to have a word.

1:11:33.439 --> 1:11:36.439
But I told him, Michael, I told him
I'm standing by my brother.

1:11:36.479 --> 1:11:38.920
Did you talk about Alison?
Nah.

1:11:40.039 --> 1:11:41.639
Like...maybe.

1:11:42.639 --> 1:11:44.920
I might have said that she wasn't
best pleased.

1:11:44.959 --> 1:11:46.959
Did you go to the house?

1:11:47.800 --> 1:11:50.200
Nah. I mean... Of course not.

1:11:50.879 --> 1:11:56.560
OK, look, maybe I said too much, but
come on, Michael, this is Delaney
that we're talking about.

1:11:56.600 --> 1:11:59.600
I'm sorry, I was scared.
Scared?

1:11:59.639 --> 1:12:03.839
You weren't that scared. You and him
have been calling each other for
months.

1:12:03.879 --> 1:12:06.800
What? According to Delaney's phone
records,

1:12:06.839 --> 1:12:11.239
these two have been in contact
with each other for at least six
months.

1:12:11.280 --> 1:12:13.159
I don't get it.

1:12:13.200 --> 1:12:16.079
He was setting you up, Michael.

1:12:16.119 --> 1:12:19.360
There was no debt, was there, hm?

1:12:19.400 --> 1:12:23.839
Michael?
But you told your brother there was,

1:12:23.879 --> 1:12:26.839
cos that's the only way you could get
him to work for Delaney.

1:12:26.879 --> 1:12:29.720
Michael, I didn't know
it was gonna turn out like this.

1:12:29.759 --> 1:12:33.439
Believe me. Look, mate,
whatever's coming, I deserve it.

1:12:33.479 --> 1:12:36.159
You've got every right.
(Exhales sharply)

1:12:44.839 --> 1:12:46.959
(Panting)

1:12:51.680 --> 1:12:55.039
Michael?
(Door opens)

1:12:55.079 --> 1:12:57.079
Michael, wait!

1:12:57.119 --> 1:12:59.119
How much did Delaney pay you?

1:12:59.159 --> 1:13:01.079
Nothing. Look, I was scared.

1:13:01.959 --> 1:13:03.879
(Grunts)
Mr Glenn!

1:13:03.920 --> 1:13:06.479
I didn't do it. I didn't kill her!
Mr Glenn!

1:13:06.519 --> 1:13:08.839
You just don't get it, do you,
Jason?

1:13:10.560 --> 1:13:12.600
I should've been at home that
night...

1:13:12.639 --> 1:13:15.479
(Grunts)
..protecting my wife.

1:13:15.519 --> 1:13:17.720
My family.

1:13:17.759 --> 1:13:21.079
But instead I was with my brother...
He's not worth it, Michael.

1:13:22.119 --> 1:13:23.839
..cos I thought he needed my help.

1:13:26.920 --> 1:13:29.280
But you were just helping yourself.
(Grunts)

1:13:32.839 --> 1:13:34.839
(Gasps and coughs)

1:13:39.400 --> 1:13:41.400
(Coughs)

1:13:49.319 --> 1:13:52.079
They're processing Jason now.
What's he saying?

1:13:52.119 --> 1:13:54.600
Wants to talk to his brother.
Good luck with that.

1:13:54.639 --> 1:13:58.680
Ma'am, you're needed downstairs.
Robert Naresby's here and he's
kicking off.

1:13:58.720 --> 1:14:00.039
Aiden!

1:14:00.079 --> 1:14:01.800
I want to see my son!

1:14:01.839 --> 1:14:04.959
Just calm down. You've got no right
keeping him here.

1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:06.720
That is enough.
Hand him over!

1:14:06.759 --> 1:14:09.280
Calm yourself, Robert.
I want my son.

1:14:09.319 --> 1:14:12.000
He's safe, sir.
I want to see my son!

1:14:12.039 --> 1:14:15.720
You get him out here now!
I need you to be calm, OK?

1:14:15.759 --> 1:14:19.000
He needs me!
Mr Naresby. Please.

1:14:19.039 --> 1:14:21.239
Is that your car, Robert?

1:14:23.560 --> 1:14:25.560
(Engine running)

1:14:43.159 --> 1:14:46.920
How come you kept the car
in your wife's name all this time?

1:14:47.959 --> 1:14:49.959
Are you expecting her to come back?

1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:52.000
No comment.

1:14:53.360 --> 1:14:55.639
Well, see this here, Robert.

1:14:56.280 --> 1:15:01.360
That puts you close to our crime
scene round about the time Alison was
killed.

1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:04.959
No comment.

1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.000
Mm.

1:15:08.039 --> 1:15:11.079
Did Tom tell you
he followed Alison home from here?

1:15:11.119 --> 1:15:13.560
Hm? So he knew where she lived.

1:15:14.600 --> 1:15:16.879
Only about half an hour away.

1:15:18.759 --> 1:15:23.800
'Ey, that must have rankled,
her running out on you all those
years ago.

1:15:24.839 --> 1:15:27.319
Left you to bring Tom up on your own.

1:15:27.360 --> 1:15:30.479
Never called. Never came to see you.

1:15:30.519 --> 1:15:34.119
Just abandoned you, left you to rot.

1:15:36.319 --> 1:15:39.800
So did you go to have it out with
her, hm? Is that why you're here?

1:15:41.079 --> 1:15:44.280
Did 25 years of anger become too
much?

1:15:44.319 --> 1:15:46.319
No comment.

1:15:48.479 --> 1:15:53.959
When you went to see Alison that
first time, did you tell your dad?

1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:55.519
No. Never said anything.

1:15:55.560 --> 1:16:01.119
Well, maybe you didn't say anything,
but your dad found out, didn't he,
hm?

1:16:02.280 --> 1:16:03.879
Did he?

1:16:06.879 --> 1:16:08.079
Bus ticket.

1:16:08.800 --> 1:16:10.360
Bus ticket?

1:16:10.400 --> 1:16:12.200
My jeans.

1:16:13.800 --> 1:16:15.400
He washed them the next day.

1:16:17.959 --> 1:16:23.200
Then he started shouting
and calling me stupid and soft.

1:16:24.239 --> 1:16:27.720
Now, listen, this is very important.

1:16:29.159 --> 1:16:31.839
That day your dad found the bus
ticket...

1:16:32.600 --> 1:16:34.519
..that night...

1:16:35.239 --> 1:16:37.280
..did your dad go out?

1:16:39.119 --> 1:16:41.119
Did he leave the farm?

1:16:48.800 --> 1:16:52.959
He's not got an alibi and we can put
him on the Larchford Estate
the night of Alison's murder.

1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:56.039
That's something, at least.
That's not enough. Keep looking.

1:16:56.079 --> 1:17:00.360
Robert Naresby's no housekeeper
but, so far, we've got nothing.

1:17:00.400 --> 1:17:02.519
Sir.
Hold on.

1:17:02.560 --> 1:17:05.639
You found something?
Old photos.

1:17:07.239 --> 1:17:09.239
Of what?

1:17:10.839 --> 1:17:12.159
Aiden?

1:17:13.079 --> 1:17:16.560
A baby, from 1991.

1:17:19.800 --> 1:17:21.800
What's the baby's name, Tom?

1:17:24.879 --> 1:17:28.079
It's Emma. Baby Emma.

1:17:28.119 --> 1:17:30.519
Ah, she's beautiful.

1:17:31.680 --> 1:17:33.879
Was Alison her mam?

1:17:36.519 --> 1:17:39.159
So what happened to baby Emma?

1:17:39.200 --> 1:17:40.800
Don't know.

1:17:40.839 --> 1:17:44.159
Did Alison take her with her
when she left?

1:17:44.200 --> 1:17:46.200
No.

1:17:46.239 --> 1:17:48.519
She went after.

1:17:48.560 --> 1:17:52.079
After? After what, love?

1:17:52.119 --> 1:17:54.839
After baby Emma had to leave us.

1:17:56.680 --> 1:17:59.839
Well, why did baby Emma have to
leave?

1:18:01.479 --> 1:18:03.200
Dad.

1:18:05.079 --> 1:18:09.600
He said she couldn't stay
so, one night, he took her away.

1:18:11.119 --> 1:18:12.600
Took her where?

1:18:14.920 --> 1:18:16.639
Tom?

1:18:22.119 --> 1:18:24.119
I don't know.

1:18:30.200 --> 1:18:32.360
What did you do with her?

1:18:33.400 --> 1:18:37.439
Look at her! Just a few weeks old.
You took her from her mam.

1:18:37.479 --> 1:18:39.519
What did you do with her?

1:18:43.800 --> 1:18:46.319
Alison had no business getting
pregnant.

1:18:47.360 --> 1:18:49.159
She wasn't fit to be a mother.

1:18:49.200 --> 1:18:51.000
She couldn't raise a child.

1:18:51.039 --> 1:18:54.959
She was still a child herself.
Well, you didn't wait to find out.

1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:57.800
I had to deal with Tom on my own.

1:18:58.839 --> 1:19:00.879
I couldn't take on another one.

1:19:00.920 --> 1:19:03.280
What did you do with her?

1:19:05.239 --> 1:19:07.319
And I wanted to help Alison.

1:19:08.239 --> 1:19:11.079
Do the right thing.
Give her a chance.

1:19:11.920 --> 1:19:13.720
Is that why she tried to kill
herself?

1:19:13.759 --> 1:19:17.239
I didn't know she was going to react
like she did.

1:19:18.280 --> 1:19:20.560
You think I wanted that?

1:19:20.600 --> 1:19:23.639
To come home, find her lying there,

1:19:23.680 --> 1:19:26.680
sheets all covered with blood.

1:19:28.879 --> 1:19:33.280
Afterwards, I wanted to explain...

1:19:34.720 --> 1:19:36.720
..but she left.

1:19:37.479 --> 1:19:39.159
Ran off.

1:19:40.200 --> 1:19:43.439
That's why I went to the house, to
explain.

1:19:44.400 --> 1:19:46.400
To say I was sorry.

1:19:49.159 --> 1:19:51.159
But I couldn't.

1:19:52.360 --> 1:19:54.360
I parked outside the house.

1:19:56.879 --> 1:19:58.879
I couldn't face her.

1:20:08.119 --> 1:20:11.879
But what did you do with the baby?

1:20:14.400 --> 1:20:16.200
I took care of her.

1:20:16.239 --> 1:20:18.879
What does that mean, Robert?

1:20:21.680 --> 1:20:23.319
It means...

1:20:24.360 --> 1:20:26.159
..I took care of her.

1:20:28.600 --> 1:20:32.280
I gave her to someone, made sure
she was safe.

1:20:33.439 --> 1:20:35.639
The father?

1:20:36.879 --> 1:20:38.879
Did you take her to her dad?

1:20:40.519 --> 1:20:42.879
Who was it, Robert?

1:20:45.800 --> 1:20:47.800
Who was he?

1:20:47.839 --> 1:20:49.839
I'm done talking.

1:20:53.680 --> 1:20:55.519
Why the stone wall?

1:20:55.560 --> 1:20:57.519
Why not just tell us who the dad is?

1:21:05.959 --> 1:21:07.560
1991?

1:21:12.039 --> 1:21:13.680
He doesn't need to tell us.

1:21:14.720 --> 1:21:19.239
It wasn't rape. If that's what
you're thinking, it wasn't like
that.

1:21:19.280 --> 1:21:22.639
She was 16 years old.
I was practically a kid myself.

1:21:22.680 --> 1:21:24.879
22. Just out of university.

1:21:24.920 --> 1:21:28.319
She was still a child
and a vulnerable one at that.

1:21:28.360 --> 1:21:30.200
She was supposed to be in your care.

1:21:30.239 --> 1:21:33.800
Alison was vulnerable in many ways,
but she was very mature in others.

1:21:33.839 --> 1:21:35.839
Can you even hear yourself?

1:21:35.879 --> 1:21:39.400
I was trying to help, but I was
young, naive.

1:21:41.039 --> 1:21:43.039
(Groans) I was lost.

1:21:43.079 --> 1:21:46.280
Alison was lost too. We were just
trying to help each other through
it.

1:21:46.319 --> 1:21:48.920
When did you find out she was
pregnant?

1:21:48.959 --> 1:21:52.119
I didn't know until much later.

1:21:52.159 --> 1:21:54.119
When her old man
brought the baby to you?

1:21:54.159 --> 1:21:57.319
Yeah. Said she was my
responsibility.

1:21:57.360 --> 1:21:59.879
So what did you do with her?

1:22:00.920 --> 1:22:02.519
What do you think?

1:22:03.800 --> 1:22:05.800
Took care of her. Raised her.

1:22:05.839 --> 1:22:08.319
There's no record of an Emma
Naresby.

1:22:08.360 --> 1:22:11.759
Well, of course not. We changed her
name.

1:22:11.800 --> 1:22:14.239
We? Who's we?

1:22:14.280 --> 1:22:17.400
Angela, my wife.

1:22:17.439 --> 1:22:21.839
I told her all about it, then we
took her in. And your wife, she was
OK with that?

1:22:22.879 --> 1:22:26.079
She developed cancer first year
at uni.

1:22:26.959 --> 1:22:28.680
It's why we got married so young.

1:22:29.720 --> 1:22:31.560
In the end, she had a hysterectomy.

1:22:32.439 --> 1:22:35.959
She always wanted kids,
so when Robert turned up,

1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:39.600
it wasn't perfect, but we made it
work.

1:22:39.639 --> 1:22:43.600
My wife died three years ago, but I
know she was proud to be a mother.

1:22:43.639 --> 1:22:47.039
And you should meet my daughter.
She's a wonderful person.

1:22:47.079 --> 1:22:50.439
She's kind. She's clever.
Is she a teacher?

1:22:51.639 --> 1:22:53.439
How did you know that?

1:22:57.039 --> 1:22:59.039
I can't do it.

1:23:01.479 --> 1:23:05.839
I can't remember any lines.
So what?

1:23:05.879 --> 1:23:08.079
It doesn't matter.
I'll let everyone down.

1:23:08.119 --> 1:23:10.720
No-one is going to think that.
I'll think that.

1:23:11.759 --> 1:23:13.800
I wanted to do it for her.

1:23:14.519 --> 1:23:16.519
For Mum.

1:23:18.759 --> 1:23:20.759
(Chatter)

1:23:33.319 --> 1:23:35.519
Check backstage.
Yeah.

1:23:51.560 --> 1:23:54.879
Can I ask you to wait outside, Molly?

1:23:54.920 --> 1:23:56.439
Why?

1:23:56.479 --> 1:23:58.959
Because I need to talk to Mrs
Brennan.

1:23:59.560 --> 1:24:01.560
But I need to get ready.

1:24:06.119 --> 1:24:07.720
Molly, maybe you should go.

1:24:10.119 --> 1:24:11.720
No.

1:24:11.759 --> 1:24:15.119
Molly...
I'm not going anywhere.

1:24:21.519 --> 1:24:25.200
OK. So when did you find out?

1:24:26.400 --> 1:24:28.400
Find out what?

1:24:32.400 --> 1:24:34.839
Three years ago.

1:24:34.879 --> 1:24:36.759
My mum told me before she died.

1:24:36.800 --> 1:24:39.759
Ah, that must have been hard for you.

1:24:41.560 --> 1:24:43.759
You know, I didn't really think
about it.

1:24:43.800 --> 1:24:46.159
Not at the time.

1:24:46.200 --> 1:24:47.959
I was too busy grieving her.

1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:51.400
Mm. So when did that change?

1:24:51.439 --> 1:24:55.800
After a while... I kept thinking
about her.

1:24:56.680 --> 1:24:58.280
I had to meet her, you know.

1:24:58.319 --> 1:25:00.200
Will someone tell me what's going
on?

1:25:00.239 --> 1:25:05.000
Mrs Brennan came to work at your
school, Molly, for a reason.

1:25:06.079 --> 1:25:08.479
She wanted to meet someone.
Someone important.

1:25:09.519 --> 1:25:11.759
She wanted to meet your mam.

1:25:15.200 --> 1:25:17.479
Our mam.

1:25:18.519 --> 1:25:23.720
Molly, I know this is hard for you
to understand, right, I know that.

1:25:23.759 --> 1:25:27.600
The best part of all of this for me
was meeting you, all right?

1:25:27.639 --> 1:25:30.119
Meeting my sister.
Stay away from me!

1:25:30.159 --> 1:25:32.239
Molly...

1:25:35.800 --> 1:25:39.039
Did Mum know?
No. Not in the beginning.

1:25:39.079 --> 1:25:44.319
Now, was it when she came to the
school for the meeting with Molly,
the day she died?

1:25:44.360 --> 1:25:46.400
Yeah, I don't know why, just...

1:25:46.439 --> 1:25:50.680
She was just there in the office,
telling me how worried she was about
Molly.

1:25:51.720 --> 1:25:53.319
It just came out.

1:25:53.360 --> 1:25:55.479
And how did she react?

1:25:56.519 --> 1:25:59.600
She barely even registered.

1:26:00.680 --> 1:26:03.039
She just stood up and walked out.

1:26:03.079 --> 1:26:05.039
So I wanted to give her another
chance.

1:26:06.039 --> 1:26:10.519
I thought she might think different
after she'd had some time
to process.

1:26:10.560 --> 1:26:12.200
So that night,

1:26:12.239 --> 1:26:16.879
after you sent Molly home in a taxi,
what did you do?

1:26:22.839 --> 1:26:24.759
I went over to your house.

1:26:25.800 --> 1:26:28.800
I went round the back and she saw
me, so she came out.

1:26:30.479 --> 1:26:35.920
Molly, I had to let her know how
much I wanted to be part of her
life, all right,

1:26:35.959 --> 1:26:37.560
but she didn't want that.

1:26:37.600 --> 1:26:39.439
She told me I wasn't her daughter.

1:26:41.159 --> 1:26:44.839
And then she turned her back on me
and I... I just... I hit her.

1:26:44.879 --> 1:26:46.479
(sobs)

1:26:47.439 --> 1:26:48.560
You...

1:26:48.600 --> 1:26:50.439
Molly...
It was you!

1:26:50.479 --> 1:26:53.200
It wasn't my fault.
You! It was you!

1:26:53.239 --> 1:26:56.360
It was you! You!
Molly!

1:26:57.079 --> 1:26:59.079
No! (Sobs)

1:27:02.200 --> 1:27:04.200
(Sobs)

1:27:10.239 --> 1:27:12.119
She was my mum.

1:27:12.800 --> 1:27:14.800
Aye, she was, pet.

1:27:16.639 --> 1:27:18.639
I just wanted her to know me.

1:27:57.639 --> 1:28:00.639
How are they doing?

1:28:00.680 --> 1:28:02.680
Better than they should be.
Mm.

1:28:02.720 --> 1:28:06.000
Well, you shouldn't have lied,
Michael. I know.

1:28:06.039 --> 1:28:09.200
If you'd been straight from the
start, we could have helped.

1:28:09.239 --> 1:28:11.239
I messed up. I'm sorry.

1:28:12.280 --> 1:28:13.959
You heard from the CPS?

1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:17.920
No. My solicitor says
they haven't made a decision yet.

1:28:18.839 --> 1:28:23.439
Well, I'm sure they'd have been made
aware of your circumstances.

1:28:23.479 --> 1:28:25.839
Did YOU make them aware?

1:28:28.039 --> 1:28:30.159
Go be with your kids, Michael.

1:28:39.239 --> 1:28:41.239
Come on, you.

1:28:42.039 --> 1:28:44.239
Up.

1:28:44.280 --> 1:28:46.280
Inside, darling.

1:28:55.200 --> 1:28:57.200
(Door closes)
