00:45.454 --> 00:47.134
Ohh!

00:47.134 --> 00:48.814
Man.

00:48.814 --> 00:51.134
Oww! Hey, bud. Where you been?

00:51.134 --> 00:53.174
Just got back from the Dentibot.
I needed a filling.

00:53.174 --> 00:54.734
Bet you chickened, though, right?

00:54.734 --> 00:58.014
Soon as that robo-drill started
screeching, I bet you were gone.

00:58.014 --> 00:59.454
Yeah. How d'you know that?

00:59.454 --> 01:00.654
You're still wearing a bib.

01:02.174 --> 01:03.814
Who needs a dental bot
anyway, man?

01:03.814 --> 01:06.774
Half a bottle of GELF hooch,
can't feel a thing now.

01:06.811 --> 01:07.931
Anywhere.

01:07.931 --> 01:09.971
Starting to worry, actually.

01:09.971 --> 01:12.651
If it was me,
I'd get my teeth fixed, Gummy.

01:12.651 --> 01:15.491
Otherwise in a couple of years,
you'll be flossing with towrope.

01:15.491 --> 01:16.571
Eeh, eeh, eeh.

01:25.371 --> 01:27.251
Can you hear that? Hear what?

01:27.251 --> 01:28.651
That! Can't you hear it?

01:28.651 --> 01:30.291
It's driving me crazy.

01:30.291 --> 01:32.171
All over the ship, wherever I go,

01:32.171 --> 01:34.651
there's this really annoying
whiny sound.

01:34.651 --> 01:37.171
Yeah, it's you.
Stop talking, it goes.

01:37.171 --> 01:38.651
Still there.

01:38.651 --> 01:39.811
You're still talking!

01:40.851 --> 01:44.171
Lister. This ship is falling apart.
I need some help.

01:44.171 --> 01:48.011
Don't look at me, Rimmer.
I am busy today.

01:48.011 --> 01:51.811
Busy? And what are you doing today
that makes you so "busy"?

01:51.811 --> 01:53.971
I'm getting drunk.

01:53.971 --> 01:55.331
That's your day?

01:55.331 --> 01:56.731
Not just any old drunk.

01:56.731 --> 02:01.051
I'm talking traffic-cone-hugging,
pavement-licking kershnickered.

02:01.051 --> 02:03.331
That's my day. Cheers.

02:04.691 --> 02:07.371
Er...what's this?

02:07.371 --> 02:08.890
Ah, I'm making a Father's Day card.

02:08.890 --> 02:11.491
YOU'RE making a Father's Day card?

02:11.491 --> 02:13.491
You? Who to?

02:13.491 --> 02:16.891
Well, let's round up the suspects,
shall we, Sherlock?

02:18.011 --> 02:19.851
First up, there's me dad.

02:19.851 --> 02:21.691
But YOU'RE your dad.

02:21.691 --> 02:24.571
You went back in time
and left your baby self

02:24.571 --> 02:27.011
under a pool table
in a cardboard box.

02:28.811 --> 02:30.691
You're your own dad.

02:30.691 --> 02:33.611
So therefore I shouldn't get
any Father's Day cards?

02:34.691 --> 02:39.331
It's not my fault that due to some
time-travelly paradoxy sci-fi smeg

02:39.331 --> 02:41.131
I happen to be my own dad.

02:41.131 --> 02:42.891
I do this every year.

02:42.891 --> 02:45.891
I write myself a "Thanks for being
such an amazing dad" card,

02:45.891 --> 02:48.891
then I drink myself into oblivion
so I forget what I've written,

02:48.891 --> 02:50.691
and then 12 months later,
on Father's Day,

02:50.691 --> 02:52.371
which, by the way,
happens to be today,

02:52.371 --> 02:53.971
Kryten delivers a Father's Day card

02:53.971 --> 02:55.531
and I haven't got a clue
what it says.

02:56.931 --> 02:58.291
How cool is that?!

02:58.291 --> 03:01.251
Morning, sirs!
Oh, he hasn't!

03:01.251 --> 03:03.131
Oh, I think he has, sir.

03:03.131 --> 03:04.891
He never forgets his old dad.

03:07.251 --> 03:08.851
I don't know how he finds the time,

03:08.851 --> 03:10.971
what with all the things he's up to
as well.

03:10.971 --> 03:12.571
Aww.

03:12.571 --> 03:14.411
Look at that!

03:14.411 --> 03:15.651
Dreads!

03:15.651 --> 03:17.371
Brilliant!

03:17.371 --> 03:19.171
I mean, how funny is that?

03:19.171 --> 03:21.611
Oh! What a brilliant card.

03:21.611 --> 03:23.571
Made it himself, you know.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.531
Oh, look, a bit of poppadom!

03:27.331 --> 03:28.931
Poppadom!

03:28.931 --> 03:29.931
Aww.

03:30.931 --> 03:31.931
Aww.

03:32.971 --> 03:34.171
Aww!

03:35.131 --> 03:36.611
So thoughtful.

03:36.611 --> 03:38.611
Aww. Wait a minute.

03:38.611 --> 03:40.651
How can you even stand your dad?

03:40.651 --> 03:43.211
He abandoned you in a pub
in a cardboard box.

03:43.211 --> 03:46.611
The only thing he's ever given you
your whole life

03:46.611 --> 03:48.651
is a rattle and a few air holes.

03:49.891 --> 03:51.291
What kind of a dad is that?

03:51.291 --> 03:53.051
That's true, yeah.

03:53.051 --> 03:55.691
That's right. That's...that's not
right, that, is it?

03:59.251 --> 04:00.931
There it is again,
that whiny sound.

04:00.931 --> 04:02.171
You're talking again!

04:06.331 --> 04:07.691
Number 32-12 required,

04:07.691 --> 04:11.131
and a replacement
valve-housing gasket for 17.

04:11.131 --> 04:12.691
Noted, sir.

04:12.691 --> 04:13.731
I thought the new computer

04:13.731 --> 04:15.371
was supposed to be helping
with all this.

04:15.371 --> 04:17.130
It's not uploaded yet, sir.
Later today.

04:17.130 --> 04:20.651
Hey, Kryten, how's it going?
Great night last night.

04:20.651 --> 04:22.931
You can say that again, 16!

04:22.931 --> 04:25.531
We had quite a night of it
last night, sir.

04:25.531 --> 04:27.331
Me and a bunch of
the dispensing machines

04:27.331 --> 04:29.291
got together and played
Chinese Whispers.

04:29.291 --> 04:31.131
We had so much fun.

04:31.131 --> 04:32.771
Now, the sentence started as,

04:32.771 --> 04:35.411
"I slit the sheet, the sheet I
slit, on the slit sheet, I..."

04:35.411 --> 04:36.651
Kryten. Yes, sir?

04:36.651 --> 04:38.051
Shut up. Yes, sir.

04:38.051 --> 04:40.251
I'm not remotely interested
in some stupid parlour game

04:40.251 --> 04:42.491
you were playing
with a talking condom machine

04:42.491 --> 04:43.891
and two Lil-Let dispensers.

04:43.891 --> 04:45.451
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
Thank you, sir.

04:45.451 --> 04:48.851
While we're at it, Chinese
Whispers - isn't that racist?

04:48.851 --> 04:51.371
Basically, what you're saying
is that Chinese people

04:51.371 --> 04:54.251
can't convey a simple piece
of information to one another.

04:54.251 --> 04:55.491
Now, if that's the case,

04:55.491 --> 04:58.211
how come they invented
acupuncture, gunpowder...

04:58.211 --> 05:01.691
laundry,
and those funny little hats?

05:01.691 --> 05:04.851
Chinese Whispers - it's offensive,
racist and wrong.

05:04.851 --> 05:07.131
Ask around, I think you'll find
I'm right.

05:10.131 --> 05:11.491
So, how can I help?

05:11.491 --> 05:14.371
I need some advice. I want to
be a better father to my son.

05:14.371 --> 05:16.571
What kind of person is your son?

05:16.571 --> 05:17.851
Ooh, tough question.

05:17.851 --> 05:22.051
If I had to sum him up in one word,
it would be...ohh...

05:22.051 --> 05:23.371
awesome?

05:24.411 --> 05:27.011
And he's smart.
I mean, OK, not book-smart,

05:27.011 --> 05:29.051
but that's only
cos he hasn't read any books.

05:29.051 --> 05:31.011
If he had, then who knows?!

05:31.011 --> 05:33.771
And he's a killer guitarist.

05:33.771 --> 05:37.651
You know, when he's had a few,
he is up there with Hendrix.

05:37.651 --> 05:39.651
So what's the problem?

05:39.651 --> 05:41.331
He's in a rut.

05:41.331 --> 05:42.651
He's not going anywhere.

05:42.651 --> 05:45.011
No job, no girlfriend,
and to be honest,

05:45.011 --> 05:48.451
I know I shouldn't,
but I kind of blame myself.

05:48.451 --> 05:50.731
So he's a total bum.

05:50.731 --> 05:52.811
Total bum?! I don't think so.

05:52.811 --> 05:55.371
A bum, maybe,
but TOTAL bum? No way.

05:56.891 --> 05:59.731
Ah! That's weird. I don't seem

05:59.731 --> 06:02.851
to have your son on file. Ah, well,
there's a reason for that.

06:02.851 --> 06:06.731
He should register! He's missing
out on a whole raft of privileges.

06:06.731 --> 06:08.571
Is he?

06:08.571 --> 06:09.971
Free Christmas champagne!

06:09.971 --> 06:11.811
His own TV and game package!

06:11.811 --> 06:13.331
It'll only take five minutes.

06:13.331 --> 06:17.171
Quick medical, so we can set up
his bios for stasis, and he's done.

06:17.171 --> 06:18.451
What's his name?

06:18.451 --> 06:20.811
Dave. Same as you!

06:20.811 --> 06:23.011
I'll open a file for him
right now.

06:23.011 --> 06:25.451
Done. OK, here's what I think.

06:25.451 --> 06:26.891
Tough love.

06:26.891 --> 06:27.931
Tough love.

06:27.931 --> 06:28.971
Set him goals.

06:28.971 --> 06:31.571
He doesn't achieve those goals,
kick his butt.

06:31.571 --> 06:33.371
Kick it hard! Tough love.

06:33.371 --> 06:35.491
Tough love. Tough love.

06:38.851 --> 06:41.731
That's a great question,
Kryten. Is Chinese Whispers racist?

06:41.731 --> 06:44.131
Leave it with me.
I'll do some research.

06:45.171 --> 06:46.211
Hi, Garby.

06:47.291 --> 06:49.931
So you're a cat of the world -
what do you think?

06:49.931 --> 06:51.731
Eh, I dunno, 16.

06:51.731 --> 06:53.451
But you got me intrigued.

06:53.451 --> 06:55.731
Let me ask around.

06:57.011 --> 06:59.731
Thank goodness for that derelict,
sir. I am just so excited

06:59.731 --> 07:03.211
at the prospect of having
a new computer! We so miss Holly.

07:03.211 --> 07:04.811
It's true - we just don't get

07:04.811 --> 07:07.491
the same quality of cock-up
these days, do we?

07:08.651 --> 07:10.731
OK, sir. The computer
is ready to launch.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.491
Here we go, the "pref" menus.

07:12.491 --> 07:13.731
Ah.

07:13.731 --> 07:15.091
Male or female?

07:15.091 --> 07:16.731
Female. Not really bothered.

07:16.731 --> 07:18.611
Doesn't really matter. Female.

07:20.651 --> 07:23.091
Age - 25, 50, or 75?

07:23.091 --> 07:24.371
Whatever.

07:24.371 --> 07:26.451
Let's not get held back by this,
Kryten.

07:26.451 --> 07:27.611
25.

07:29.371 --> 07:30.491
Blonde or brunette?

07:30.491 --> 07:33.611
Honestly don't care.
It doesn't matter. Not important.

07:33.611 --> 07:34.771
Blonde.

07:36.171 --> 07:37.291
Breast size.

07:40.371 --> 07:41.451
I can't honestly believe

07:41.451 --> 07:43.611
they actually still ask
that question these days.

07:43.611 --> 07:45.371
It's absolutely ludicrous,
it really is.

07:45.371 --> 07:46.651
I totally agree with you, sir.

07:46.651 --> 07:48.251
I'll choose the first one.

07:48.251 --> 07:49.851
30A. Hang on!

07:50.931 --> 07:52.291
What's the hurry, Kryten?

07:52.291 --> 07:54.731
Everyone knows you don't
just pick the first thing

07:54.731 --> 07:56.011
that comes into your head.

07:56.011 --> 07:57.571
What's that one down there
at the bottom?

07:57.571 --> 08:00.171
That's...a 36D, sir.

08:00.171 --> 08:01.851
Fine. Go with that one.

08:01.851 --> 08:03.011
Whatever.

08:03.011 --> 08:05.011
36D it is.

08:05.011 --> 08:07.491
I've already highlighted 30A, sir.
Kryten,

08:07.491 --> 08:09.771
don't argue. 36D it is.

08:09.771 --> 08:12.731
But sir!
Kryten, it's not important.

08:12.731 --> 08:15.411
I don't know why you're making
such a fuss about this.

08:15.411 --> 08:17.571
36D. Select it. Moving on.

08:17.571 --> 08:19.011
But I'm not making a fuss, sir.

08:19.011 --> 08:21.171
I'm just...
OK, I'm pulling rank.

08:21.171 --> 08:25.171
I order you to select 36D as the
breast size for the new computer.

08:25.171 --> 08:26.531
And that's an order.

08:26.531 --> 08:28.531
Selected, sir.

08:28.531 --> 08:29.931
Ah, now...

08:29.931 --> 08:31.091
Personality.

08:31.091 --> 08:32.451
Whatever. Oh.

08:32.451 --> 08:35.010
Accent? Whatever.

08:35.010 --> 08:38.051
Frame size.
Your call. Let's launch. Who cares?

08:38.051 --> 08:39.811
Close-up chosen.

08:39.811 --> 08:41.131
Ah, there we go.

08:41.131 --> 08:43.571
Oh, I really like that frame size,
don't you, sir?

08:43.571 --> 08:44.891
Hey-hey! Ooh!

08:44.891 --> 08:46.891
Hello. My name's Pree.

08:46.891 --> 08:49.731
It will take a few moments
for my database to initialise.

08:49.731 --> 08:52.811
Oww! Nice pixels!
Hey, buds, what's happening?

08:52.811 --> 08:54.851
We're just launching
the new computer, sir.

08:54.851 --> 08:56.171
Here we go.

08:56.171 --> 08:57.451
Greetings, gentlemen.

08:57.451 --> 09:00.011
My name is Pree, and I will be
your new ship computer.

09:00.011 --> 09:03.051
I have many functions, including
predictive behaviour technology.

09:03.051 --> 09:05.891
Predictive what?! Like
predictive text on a cell phone,

09:05.891 --> 09:07.291
predictive behaviour technology

09:07.291 --> 09:09.371
anticipates your actions
based on past behaviour

09:09.371 --> 09:11.211
and performs
the rest of the action for you.

09:12.531 --> 09:15.011
How's she able to do that?!
Well, best guess,

09:15.011 --> 09:18.091
she builds behavioural algorithms
from the ship's security footage,

09:18.091 --> 09:20.851
so she's able to guess
how we're most likely to behave

09:20.851 --> 09:22.491
in any given situation.

09:22.491 --> 09:24.131
Exactly right, Kryten.

09:24.131 --> 09:25.691
What about maintenance?

09:25.691 --> 09:27.651
Can you repair the ship's
engineering faults?

09:27.651 --> 09:30.291
I already anticipated you'd ask me
that question, Arnold,

09:30.291 --> 09:32.171
and I've repaired all the faults
on B Deck already.

09:32.171 --> 09:34.811
There is now a 98% probability
you will discuss

09:34.811 --> 09:37.171
my potential for changing your lives
and reach the conclusion

09:37.171 --> 09:39.131
that you're looking forward
to seeing me in action.

09:41.051 --> 09:43.091
You now no longer need to
have this conversation

09:43.091 --> 09:44.291
and can do something else.

09:44.291 --> 09:46.811
So now we don't have
that conversation

09:46.811 --> 09:48.811
and move straight on
to the next conversation?

09:48.811 --> 09:50.051
Your next conversation

09:50.051 --> 09:52.571
is a conversation about not
having the previous conversation,

09:52.571 --> 09:55.091
saying you were looking forward
to the previous conversation,

09:55.091 --> 09:57.291
and now feel a bit lost,
not having had that conversation.

09:57.291 --> 09:59.731
You conclude you will probably
get used to hearing the results

09:59.731 --> 10:03.291
of your conversations and no longer
having the conversations yourselves.

10:04.571 --> 10:06.411
Hey! New computer!

10:07.451 --> 10:08.731
Predictive.

10:08.731 --> 10:11.651
Knows what you're likely to say
and do in any given situation.

10:11.651 --> 10:14.211
Heh-hey, that could come in handy!
Got a job for you.

10:14.211 --> 10:15.251
I know.

10:32.051 --> 10:33.771
Kebab pillow.

10:33.771 --> 10:36.211
I must have got trashed last night.

10:38.371 --> 10:39.891
Throbbo.

10:42.451 --> 10:43.891
What's this?

10:45.251 --> 10:46.731
Don't remember making this.

10:51.091 --> 10:52.891
Hi, son.

10:52.891 --> 10:55.091
It's your dad here.

10:55.091 --> 10:57.211
- Dad!
- Here's the plan.

10:57.211 --> 10:59.251
I'm going to give you some advice.

10:59.251 --> 11:02.971
Kind of a "do as I say,
not as I do" kind of style.

11:04.931 --> 11:08.931
Then I'm going to get totally trashed
so I forget what I've said,

11:08.931 --> 11:12.451
and then when you watch this,
you'll feel like you've got

11:12.451 --> 11:15.491
a totally normal, ordinary,
regular dad, yeah?

11:15.491 --> 11:17.251
I don't remember making this.

11:17.251 --> 11:19.251
Rimmer's right.

11:19.251 --> 11:21.091
I've never been a proper dad to you.

11:22.771 --> 11:26.451
Never watched you play zero-gee,

11:26.451 --> 11:29.651
never encouraged you,
gave you advice,

11:29.651 --> 11:32.331
kicked your big fat butt
when it needed kicking.

11:32.331 --> 11:35.091
Maybe that's why
you've ended up like this.

11:35.091 --> 11:36.491
Like what?

11:36.491 --> 11:41.971
You're a big, big disappointment
to me, David, you really are.

11:41.971 --> 11:45.331
- What?
- No ambition. Sitting about.

11:45.331 --> 11:47.291
Wasting your life away.

11:48.971 --> 11:51.131
And you're not looking after
yourself.

11:51.131 --> 11:52.931
And you drink too much.

11:52.931 --> 11:54.371
It's getting worse.

11:54.371 --> 11:56.091
I'm doing OK.

11:56.091 --> 11:58.211
"I'm doing OK,"
you're probably saying.

11:58.211 --> 12:00.331
"I'm doing OK." But you're not.

12:00.331 --> 12:04.331
I mean, you could have been
so much more, and-and you know it.

12:04.331 --> 12:05.811
Who are you to tell me what to do?

12:05.811 --> 12:07.651
What have you ever done
with your life?

12:22.531 --> 12:24.051
You've gotta get yourself
an education.

12:24.051 --> 12:27.491
At least get good at SOMETHING,
and then...

12:27.491 --> 12:32.411
and then build a home, a proper home,
and then go and find Krissy.

12:32.411 --> 12:34.331
And how do I do all of that?

12:34.331 --> 12:36.211
Er...

12:36.211 --> 12:37.731
Step one.

12:37.731 --> 12:41.171
Enrol in the Jupiter Mining
Corporation engineering programme.

12:41.171 --> 12:43.971
Er, step two,
get that filling fixed.

12:43.971 --> 12:45.491
And then play the next message.

12:49.091 --> 12:50.291
So!

12:50.291 --> 12:54.451
You had to enrol in the Jupiter
engineering mining programme

12:54.451 --> 12:56.011
and get that filling fixed.

12:56.011 --> 12:58.931
How did it go, eh?
D'you make your old man proud?

13:00.371 --> 13:02.571
You didn't do it, did you, David?

13:02.571 --> 13:05.491
No! You just skipped ahead
to the next message

13:05.491 --> 13:08.371
- to see what I'd say, didn't you?
- Yes, Dad.

13:08.371 --> 13:10.411
I knew you'd do that.
It was a test.

13:10.411 --> 13:12.851
- Sorry, Dad.
- Now, get your filling fixed,

13:12.851 --> 13:15.691
no messing,
then play message three, yeah?

13:20.011 --> 13:22.731
What, d'you think I'm stupid?
Is that what do you think?

13:22.731 --> 13:24.251
D'you think I'm stupid, eh?

13:24.251 --> 13:27.011
Get the filling fixed,
then play the next message!

13:27.011 --> 13:29.571
- What the smeg?
- And don't swear.

13:29.571 --> 13:32.091
How the smeg d'you know
I was going to swear?

13:32.091 --> 13:34.691
Let me make one thing
crystal clear, young man.

13:34.691 --> 13:36.971
I will not be having
any of your nonsense.

13:36.971 --> 13:40.571
While you're living under my roof,
on my spaceship,

13:40.571 --> 13:41.731
you abide by my rules.

13:41.731 --> 13:44.691
And if you don't like it,
well, you know what you can do.

13:44.691 --> 13:47.211
Now, if you skip ahead one more time,

13:47.211 --> 13:51.011
I'm going to flush that guitar
of yours out of an airlock.

13:51.011 --> 13:54.131
Now, get the filling done NOW.

13:57.691 --> 14:00.731
Thought I'd finally
do what you wanted, did you?

14:00.731 --> 14:03.091
Well, you got that wrong.

14:03.091 --> 14:07.211
Message four. Good.
We're finally making some progress.

14:07.211 --> 14:08.331
Wrong!

14:08.331 --> 14:10.851
Finally learned a little bit
of respect.

14:10.851 --> 14:13.571
- Wro-ong!
- By the way, see your guitar?

14:13.571 --> 14:15.211
Go on. Go over there.

14:15.211 --> 14:16.651
Give us a song.

14:16.651 --> 14:18.171
What's he up to?

14:28.211 --> 14:30.051
Have a look out of that porthole
there.

14:30.051 --> 14:32.971
See that tiny speck
half a light year away?

14:32.971 --> 14:34.891
That's your Gibson Les Paul,
that is.

14:34.891 --> 14:37.971
- No!
- Tough love. D'you want some more?

14:37.971 --> 14:40.851
Now, enrol in the mech
engineering programme

14:40.851 --> 14:42.691
and get the filling done now!

14:42.691 --> 14:44.811
Or you'll get some more
Daddy Discipline.

14:46.651 --> 14:49.131
I really loved that guitar!
You don't understand me!

14:49.131 --> 14:51.891
I hate you! Bastard!

15:00.610 --> 15:02.210
Evening, Pree.

15:02.210 --> 15:04.490
Glad you had such a good day,
Arnold.

15:04.490 --> 15:07.210
So sorry this evening's
going to be such a nightmare.

15:07.210 --> 15:10.930
Ah, but it's not. I'm going
to put my feet up and watch TV.

15:10.930 --> 15:13.930
Put on Victory South for me,
will you?

15:13.930 --> 15:17.410
A fascinating drama series
about the American Civil War

15:17.410 --> 15:18.730
where the South win.

15:18.730 --> 15:22.610
Loved series one, really
looking forward to series two.

15:22.610 --> 15:26.270
I deleted all 24 episodes
earlier this morning, Arnold.

15:26.278 --> 15:27.478
What?!

15:27.478 --> 15:29.758
I watched them all yesterday,
and you didn't enjoy them.

15:31.078 --> 15:32.718
But I haven't seen them.

15:32.718 --> 15:34.718
But if you had, you wouldn't
have enjoyed them.

15:34.718 --> 15:37.798
But series one was brilliant!
Why didn't I enjoy them?

15:37.798 --> 15:39.998
All your favourite characters
were killed off,

15:39.998 --> 15:42.958
including the busty blonde heroine
with no personality.

15:42.958 --> 15:45.198
Aww, I loved her.

15:45.198 --> 15:46.478
What am I supposed to do now?

15:46.478 --> 15:48.838
I thought you could use that time
more fruitfully,

15:48.838 --> 15:51.398
perhaps finally reading
War And Peace.

15:51.398 --> 15:53.958
I want to unwind, relax.

15:53.958 --> 15:57.918
Not read a book that's longer
than Rapunzel's pubic hair.

15:57.918 --> 16:01.958
Sir, come quickly!
B Deck is in total disarray!

16:03.358 --> 16:06.558
B Deck, the floor Pree repaired?
Pree, what's happened?

16:06.558 --> 16:08.398
I thought you were going to repair
all this!

16:08.398 --> 16:10.478
I did. And thanks to
my predictive capabilities,

16:10.478 --> 16:12.038
I was able to carry out the repairs

16:12.038 --> 16:14.118
in the exact manner
you would have instructed.

16:15.598 --> 16:17.478
It's one botch-up after another,

16:17.478 --> 16:20.438
with no regard to safety procedures
or good workmanship!

16:20.438 --> 16:21.598
Exactly.

16:21.598 --> 16:23.998
How can you be a top computer
if you do something like this?

16:23.998 --> 16:25.558
I didn't, Arnold, YOU did.

16:25.558 --> 16:27.638
I merely duplicated
what you would have done.

16:27.638 --> 16:28.918
I don't understand!

16:28.918 --> 16:31.358
I'm programmed to align myself
with the ship's senior officer

16:31.358 --> 16:33.558
so computer and crew
can perform as one.

16:33.558 --> 16:36.038
What the senior officer would do,
I do for them.

16:36.038 --> 16:39.038
You're saying because
I would have cocked all this up,

16:39.038 --> 16:41.198
you cocked it all up for me?

16:41.198 --> 16:43.038
Precisely.

16:43.038 --> 16:45.758
Well, this is really embarrassing.
What do I do now?

16:45.758 --> 16:47.478
You now have a conversation
with Kryten

16:47.478 --> 16:50.598
where you blame him for everything
and then stride off indignantly.

16:50.598 --> 16:52.758
There is now no need
to have this conversation

16:52.758 --> 16:54.038
and you go straight to your exit.

17:00.958 --> 17:03.838
Is this the line for the Dentibot?

17:03.838 --> 17:05.278
Get in the queue, bud.

17:05.278 --> 17:06.758
What's up?

17:06.758 --> 17:09.838
Oh, filling.
Finally decided to get it done.

17:09.838 --> 17:12.998
Got a question for you.
Been driving everyone nuts.

17:12.998 --> 17:14.838
If anyone knows, you'll know.

17:14.838 --> 17:16.198
Here's the question.

17:16.198 --> 17:18.678
Are Chinese whiskers racist?

17:20.998 --> 17:23.558
Are Chinese whiskers racist? Mmm.

17:23.558 --> 17:26.318
D'you mean those wispy little
Mandarin beards like Fu Manchu?

17:26.318 --> 17:28.038
Exactly.

17:28.038 --> 17:30.118
Dunno. D'you know who might know?

17:30.118 --> 17:31.878
That Asian fast-food machine
on B Deck.

17:31.878 --> 17:35.558
Taiwan Tony?
Taiwan Tony. Bet he'll know.

17:35.558 --> 17:37.278
Why would he know?!

17:37.278 --> 17:40.718
Cos Taiwan Tony's from Taiwan,
and Taiwan's a bit...Chinesey.

17:41.958 --> 17:43.638
Taiwan's a bit Chinesey?

17:43.638 --> 17:44.918
Of course it is!

17:44.918 --> 17:46.318
I'll ask him.

17:48.838 --> 17:50.518
Hang on, what are YOU doing here?

17:50.518 --> 17:52.198
Heard we're nearly
out of anaesthetic.

17:52.198 --> 17:53.598
Thought I'd grab the last tank.

17:53.598 --> 17:55.478
We've only got one tank
of anaesthetic?

17:55.478 --> 17:57.638
One tank, and I'm going to grab it!

17:57.638 --> 17:59.238
But you don't need it, right?

17:59.238 --> 18:01.598
Don't need it now.
But one day I will!

18:01.598 --> 18:05.158
I'm always collecting things
I don't need for when I need 'em.

18:05.158 --> 18:06.998
You got to think ahead!

18:06.998 --> 18:08.638
But I need that anaesthetic now.

18:08.638 --> 18:10.598
See? You didn't think ahead!

18:12.398 --> 18:15.078
This is what I'm saying.
You got to think ahead.

18:16.318 --> 18:19.238
Look, I've got a cavity a stretch
limo could do a three-point turn in.

18:19.238 --> 18:21.838
I need that anaesthetic.
How about we share?

18:21.838 --> 18:25.038
Hey, bud, never ask a Cat to share.

18:25.038 --> 18:27.278
As a smash in the face
often offends!

18:27.278 --> 18:29.798
Hey, that's me!

18:29.798 --> 18:31.198
Wish me luck.

18:33.958 --> 18:37.438
You realise
we are out of anaesthetic.

18:37.438 --> 18:38.918
It's only pain, right?

18:38.918 --> 18:40.158
I can handle it.

18:40.158 --> 18:41.598
Proves I'm alive.

18:41.598 --> 18:43.478
I embrace it.

18:43.478 --> 18:45.238
And as for the
brain-smouldering agony,

18:45.238 --> 18:46.718
I've been told I'm not squeamish.

18:46.718 --> 18:48.718
I can certainly watch
those medical programmes

18:48.718 --> 18:51.238
where they pull the beating
heart out of a human chest

18:51.238 --> 18:52.278
and still eat pizza.

18:52.278 --> 18:56.078
So, a new filling, without
anaesthetic? I say come on,

18:56.078 --> 18:57.838
bring it on.

18:57.838 --> 18:59.678
Let the drilling commence.

19:01.518 --> 19:04.678
Hey, that's the second bib
we've lost this week!

19:04.678 --> 19:05.798
Great chow mein.

19:05.798 --> 19:10.038
Oh, you like the chow mein?
That good. I make it myself.

19:10.038 --> 19:12.238
Got a question for you. Hmm?

19:12.238 --> 19:14.518
Are Chinese whiskers racist?

19:14.518 --> 19:17.838
Ohh. That a very strange question,
Mr Cat.

19:17.838 --> 19:20.758
Leave with me. I ask people.

19:20.758 --> 19:23.838
People who pass, I ask, every time.

19:24.958 --> 19:26.078
Thanks.

19:28.758 --> 19:30.358
Did you get that filling done?

19:30.358 --> 19:31.958
Yes, sir. I did, sir.

19:31.958 --> 19:33.678
All filled up. All done.

19:33.678 --> 19:35.758
Don't you lie to me, David Lister.

19:35.758 --> 19:37.358
You chickened out again, didn't you?

19:37.358 --> 19:38.678
Yes, Dad.

19:38.678 --> 19:44.118
Well, this is going to hurt me a lot
more than it's going to hurt you.

19:44.118 --> 19:46.478
But you...you leave me no choice.

19:48.238 --> 19:49.878
Ohh!

19:49.878 --> 19:51.798
Hello? Aspirin.

19:51.798 --> 19:53.878
- Hello?
- I'm afraid the dispensers,

19:53.878 --> 19:56.558
Dave, are only programmed
to serve registered crew.

19:56.558 --> 19:58.278
Oh, new computer, hi!

19:58.278 --> 19:59.958
I am registered crew.

19:59.958 --> 20:01.798
Not any longer, former crewman.

20:01.798 --> 20:03.918
You resigned from Red Dwarf
last night.

20:03.918 --> 20:05.638
Resigned? You what?

20:06.998 --> 20:09.118
Oh, that wasn't me!
That was me dad!

20:10.478 --> 20:13.798
Who, OK, IS me, but it wasn't me
that resigned, it was him.

20:13.798 --> 20:16.038
Look, we'll start again. I'm me,

20:16.038 --> 20:18.518
and my dad's me,
because I'm my own dad.

20:18.518 --> 20:22.198
Now, to teach me a lesson,
he - my dad - resigned.

20:22.198 --> 20:23.718
Although he resigned and he is me,

20:23.718 --> 20:25.358
I don't want to resign
cos I'm not him,

20:25.358 --> 20:26.718
even though he's me.

20:27.958 --> 20:29.198
It's clear.

20:29.198 --> 20:31.958
Totally clear, former crewman.

20:31.958 --> 20:34.358
Don't say "former crewman"!
Present crewman.

20:34.358 --> 20:36.398
Your resignation
has just been processed

20:36.398 --> 20:40.038
and your free oxygen allowance
will terminate today at noon.

20:40.038 --> 20:43.038
That's...ten minutes' time!

20:43.038 --> 20:45.718
D'you know what?
I'll...I'll just re-enlist.

20:45.718 --> 20:46.918
The only way to re-enlist

20:46.918 --> 20:49.358
is to apply for one of the JMC
undergrad programmes.

20:49.358 --> 20:51.678
Ha! Yeah. That was his plan
all along.

20:51.678 --> 20:53.838
Just one question,
former crewman.

20:53.838 --> 20:55.878
Are you 21 or under?

20:55.878 --> 20:58.998
Well, my haircut is.
Does that count?

20:58.998 --> 21:00.438
I'm sorry, former crewman.

21:00.438 --> 21:02.478
That makes you ineligible
for the programme.

21:02.478 --> 21:05.918
And since the JMC is no longer
obligated to provide you with oxygen,

21:05.918 --> 21:08.798
your free supply will end
in eight minutes and counting.

21:08.798 --> 21:12.718
Ooh! I really need oxygen, it's
really important to me lifestyle!

21:12.718 --> 21:14.438
You need to leave.

21:14.438 --> 21:17.078
I'm not going anywhere.
Where will I go? I'm not leaving.

21:17.078 --> 21:18.198
You're leaving.

21:18.198 --> 21:21.478
No, I'm not. I'm staying here.
You just watch me not leave.

21:21.478 --> 21:22.638
Dave!

21:22.638 --> 21:24.798
Is that you?

21:24.798 --> 21:26.038
Dave!

21:50.278 --> 21:54.918
My friend, Mr Cat,
he has very strange question.

21:54.918 --> 21:57.118
So, I ask everyone who pass.

21:57.118 --> 21:58.798
See if they know.

21:58.798 --> 22:00.118
What's the question, TT?

22:00.118 --> 22:01.478
Do...

22:01.478 --> 22:04.878
Chinese knickers have braces?

22:06.678 --> 22:09.918
"Do Chinese knickers have braces?"

22:09.918 --> 22:12.238
Well, I suppose some of them do.

22:12.238 --> 22:15.158
Maybe for that extra feeling
of security if, say,

22:15.158 --> 22:17.998
you're a woman jumping out
of a plane in a skirt.

22:17.998 --> 22:20.278
That what I thought!

22:20.278 --> 22:23.358
Who wants their pants flying off
at 10,000 feet?

22:23.358 --> 22:27.158
It a long way down,
and draughty all the way.

22:27.158 --> 22:30.158
Leave it with me, TT.
I'll ask around.

22:30.158 --> 22:32.238
Oh, you know who might know?

22:32.238 --> 22:34.878
Dispenser 55, down on G Deck.

22:34.878 --> 22:36.718
Don't waste your time!
He know nothing!

22:36.718 --> 22:39.798
He all pre-package! All microwave!

22:54.318 --> 22:56.238
No way. Can someone help?!

22:57.838 --> 22:59.998
Help me!

22:59.998 --> 23:01.878
I'm being apprehended!

23:01.878 --> 23:03.998
Kryten, help me!

23:03.998 --> 23:05.478
I'm being chucked out!

23:10.958 --> 23:14.998
Your JMC oxygen subscription
will end in 30 seconds.

23:14.998 --> 23:16.358
Hang on, I've gotta get my gloves on!

23:16.358 --> 23:17.718
And counting.

23:17.718 --> 23:19.358
I'm not ready!
I've gotta get my stuff on!

23:19.358 --> 23:22.478
Expulsion time,
ten seconds and counting.

23:24.518 --> 23:25.918
Ten.

23:25.918 --> 23:28.518
- Nine. Five. Four.
- Just give us ten seconds...!

23:28.518 --> 23:30.438
Aaah!

23:30.438 --> 23:32.278
That wasn't ten seconds!

23:32.278 --> 23:35.278
Thank you for breathing JMC oxygen,
and we hope sometime in the future

23:35.278 --> 23:37.118
you'll decide to breathe our oxygen
again.

23:37.118 --> 23:39.598
Have a safe onward journey. Goodbye.

23:45.638 --> 23:47.198
What the hell is that?

23:47.198 --> 23:50.878
An airlock's opened, and the ship's
just ejected something!

23:50.878 --> 23:53.638
Oh! It looks like a little man
in a spacesuit!

23:53.638 --> 23:55.878
That's not a man. That's Lister.

23:55.878 --> 23:57.558
What's he doing out there?!

23:57.558 --> 24:00.598
Gentlemen.
What's happened to Lister?

24:00.598 --> 24:02.518
He resigned, Arnold,
and as a consequence,

24:02.518 --> 24:04.038
our mission goal has now changed.

24:04.038 --> 24:07.158
There's no longer a requirement
to return Crewman Lister to Earth,

24:07.158 --> 24:10.318
nor is it fiscally prudent
to return or crew this ship.

24:10.318 --> 24:12.118
Mindful of the Space Pollution Act,

24:12.118 --> 24:14.998
JMC policy dictates the ship
should dispose of itself

24:14.998 --> 24:16.958
by flying straight into
the nearest sun.

24:16.958 --> 24:18.158
What?!

24:18.158 --> 24:19.478
What about us?

24:19.478 --> 24:21.358
Never mind us, what about me?

24:22.838 --> 24:25.598
No need for alarm, Arnold,
you can come too.

24:25.598 --> 24:29.358
In fact, I'm instructed to offer you
a new position as supervising officer

24:29.358 --> 24:32.278
on our voyage
into the heart of the solar core.

24:32.278 --> 24:35.398
Operation Sizzle.

24:35.398 --> 24:37.478
Or if you prefer, Arnold,

24:37.478 --> 24:39.838
your hologrammic unit
can be shut down now.

24:39.838 --> 24:42.878
So, I have a choice.
Get turned off now,

24:42.878 --> 24:45.238
have a non-existence
for the rest of eternity,

24:45.238 --> 24:48.158
or live a little longer
and then get cooked to death?

24:48.158 --> 24:50.918
It's a real head-scratcher, sir,
no question.

24:50.918 --> 24:52.278
So how long have we got

24:52.278 --> 24:55.838
before we reach the point of
no return, the melting point?

24:55.838 --> 24:58.318
You mean the point where suncream
and floppy hats are no defence

24:58.318 --> 25:00.398
because our noses have started
melting onto our shoes,

25:00.398 --> 25:02.598
which are now floating
down the corridor

25:02.598 --> 25:04.638
in a river made up
of our own leg gravy?

25:04.638 --> 25:07.758
Well, we'll go as fast as we can,
Supervising Officer,

25:07.758 --> 25:10.318
as I know you're keen
to complete the mission.

25:10.318 --> 25:13.238
How long, you mad goth bastard?

25:13.238 --> 25:16.558
Well, I can have the ship fly
beyond its safety limits,

25:16.558 --> 25:19.438
disengage the carbon
carbon-reinforced heat shields,

25:19.438 --> 25:22.118
so it shouldn't take more than...
90 years.

25:22.118 --> 25:23.758
90 years?!

25:23.758 --> 25:25.238
Hey, that's not too bad.

25:25.238 --> 25:27.638
Did I say years? Sorry.

25:27.638 --> 25:28.798
I meant minutes.

25:28.798 --> 25:30.158
90 minutes.

26:07.438 --> 26:09.438
Sir! I'm so pleased you're OK!

26:09.438 --> 26:10.638
Not for long.

26:10.638 --> 26:12.398
In 90 minutes, we're going to be

26:12.398 --> 26:14.678
hotter than me
in a pair of silk Speedos!

26:14.678 --> 26:16.718
What are we going to do?
We're-we're finished!

26:16.718 --> 26:18.118
Oh, Kryten, we can do this.

26:18.118 --> 26:20.838
Alls we've gotta do is get to
the machine room and pull the plug

26:20.838 --> 26:23.758
on this loony. Now,
if you can unscrew that wall panel,

26:23.758 --> 26:26.438
we'll short-cut through the vents.
Right away, sir.

26:26.438 --> 26:29.758
- Two minutes, we'll be through.
- No, you won't.

26:29.758 --> 26:31.838
Your attempts to defeat me
are futile.

26:31.838 --> 26:34.398
Oh, yeah?
How are you planning on stopping us?

26:34.398 --> 26:36.958
Well, actually, sir, she controls
all the ship's functions...

26:36.958 --> 26:38.918
..so in many ways,

26:38.918 --> 26:42.478
her powers are limitless!
Gas is coming in through the vents!

26:42.478 --> 26:44.678
Might that be laughing gas?

26:46.158 --> 26:47.918
We're in!

26:49.158 --> 26:52.078
It's sealed!
There's no way through!

26:52.078 --> 26:55.518
We're screwed!
We're defenceless!

26:55.518 --> 26:57.918
Hey, Kryten, I can't think
straight with this toothache.

26:57.918 --> 27:00.798
It's that one there, mate.
Go on, pull it.

27:04.958 --> 27:07.918
Here comes the wall!
Here comes another one!

27:10.878 --> 27:14.718
Hey, Kryten!
That crazy question you asked.

27:14.718 --> 27:16.158
I've got the answer!

27:16.158 --> 27:17.438
What question, 55?

27:17.438 --> 27:20.518
"Do Siamese sisters
get whiskers in stasis?"

27:20.518 --> 27:21.798
Nah, they don't!

27:22.798 --> 27:25.758
Quick medical, so
we can set up his bios for stasis.'

27:25.758 --> 27:27.038
Stasis!

27:27.038 --> 27:28.878
Stasis! Stasis! Course!

27:28.878 --> 27:30.558
What was I thinking? I've got it!
Pree!

27:30.558 --> 27:32.918
All JMC vessels undertake
to return crew to Earth,

27:32.918 --> 27:34.758
including their dependents, right?

27:34.758 --> 27:37.638
You resigned, former crewman.
There's no way back.

27:37.638 --> 27:40.278
I didn't resign. My dad did.
We share the same name.

27:40.278 --> 27:42.158
Then you'd be on file,
and you're not.

27:42.158 --> 27:44.518
Did you check the medibay waiting
list? Isn't there a file open?

27:44.518 --> 27:46.398
David Lister, medical pending?

27:47.558 --> 27:49.158
- Yes.
- Isn't it true,

27:49.158 --> 27:51.078
once I complete my medical
and I have

27:51.078 --> 27:53.598
all my bios for stasis,
I become registered crew?

27:53.598 --> 27:55.678
- Yes.
- And as registered crew,

27:55.678 --> 27:58.078
do I have the power
to shut you down?

27:58.078 --> 28:00.918
- Yes.
- And as your primary objective

28:00.918 --> 28:04.558
is to save registered crew members
time and energy,

28:04.558 --> 28:07.518
shouldn't you just
uninstall yourself now?

28:07.518 --> 28:09.278
Your logic is faultless.

28:13.838 --> 28:15.718
Rock and roll.

28:15.718 --> 28:18.718
Dave Lister saves the day.

28:18.718 --> 28:21.958
Being brave in a hostile universe.

28:26.518 --> 28:30.558
Mr David Lister Junior, sir,
welcome aboard!

28:30.558 --> 28:32.158
Morning, Krytes.

28:32.158 --> 28:37.158
Complimentary champagne and games
package courtesy of the JMC.

28:37.158 --> 28:38.438
I'm not interested, Krytes.

28:38.438 --> 28:40.238
I've just signed up
for the Robotics programme.

28:40.238 --> 28:41.558
Going to pass that sucker.

28:41.558 --> 28:45.438
So, alcohol, computer games -
it's hasta la vista, baby!

28:45.438 --> 28:48.278
Go on, get 'em out of here. Get...

28:48.278 --> 28:50.238
Zero-gee Total Football?

28:50.238 --> 28:52.878
I didn't know this was even out!

28:52.878 --> 28:56.278
Kryten, grab yourself a remote
and say goodbye to the weekend.

28:56.278 --> 28:58.678
Your MechBook's going down, boy.

29:00.158 --> 29:03.838
Oh, and Kryten...that champagne's
not going to open itself.
