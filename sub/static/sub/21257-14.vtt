00:08.533 --> 00:10.167
(wolf howling)

00:10.200 --> 00:13.033
(voice)
Beware, it's Halloween.

00:13.067 --> 00:16.567
A night of frights
to make you scream.

00:16.600 --> 00:19.800
Huzzah!
Orson Welles has returned

00:19.833 --> 00:21.667
from a night
of trick-or-treating

00:21.700 --> 00:25.233
and causing mass panic
about the town.

00:25.267 --> 00:27.133
(voice)
Better watch out...

00:27.167 --> 00:29.233
Better watch out...
Hello?

00:29.267 --> 00:32.000
Better watch out...
Better watch out...

00:32.033 --> 00:34.133
Mom?

00:34.167 --> 00:35.600
Dad?

00:36.767 --> 00:38.467
Where is everybody?

00:38.500 --> 00:40.167
**

00:43.533 --> 00:44.733
Hello?

00:44.767 --> 00:47.233
Someone needs to check
my Halloween candy.

00:47.267 --> 00:50.333
A stranger could've poisoned it,
and I could totally die.

00:50.367 --> 00:52.067
**

00:53.500 --> 00:55.200
What was that?

00:55.233 --> 00:56.700
Grandpa?

00:56.733 --> 00:57.900
Are you haunting me?

00:57.933 --> 01:00.200
Are the dead
coming back to life?

01:00.233 --> 01:02.033
(phone ringing)

01:03.700 --> 01:05.533
(phone ringing)

01:08.333 --> 01:10.167
(phone ringing)

01:10.200 --> 01:11.833
Hello?

01:11.867 --> 01:15.867
Everything you're scared of
on Halloween is wrong...

01:15.900 --> 01:17.900
(click, dial tone)

01:19.367 --> 01:21.267
(distant thud)

01:26.933 --> 01:30.533
And I'm going
to tell you about it.

01:30.567 --> 01:32.800
(screaming)
An axe murderer!

01:32.833 --> 01:35.500
What?
No, I'm a TV host.

01:35.533 --> 01:36.800
Even worse.

01:36.833 --> 01:38.400
Hi, I'm Adam Conover,

01:38.433 --> 01:40.500
and this is
the "Adam Ruins Everything"

01:40.533 --> 01:42.300
Halloween Special!

01:42.333 --> 01:44.033

01:52.867 --> 01:54.833
Nice try, Stuart,
but that blood puddle

01:54.867 --> 01:57.500
is not consistent with
a stab wound in the back.

01:57.533 --> 02:00.400
Oh, come on.

02:00.433 --> 02:02.567
Halloween's not
supposed to be accurate,

02:02.600 --> 02:04.000
it's supposed to be scary.

02:04.033 --> 02:05.633
I got one goal tonight,

02:05.667 --> 02:07.500
and that's to be
scared spitless.

02:07.533 --> 02:08.733
So, if you're
not gonna help,

02:08.767 --> 02:10.833
at least be an adult
and check my candy.

02:10.867 --> 02:14.167
It was probably poisoned
by an evil stranger.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.200
Hah! I would,
but the idea that

02:16.233 --> 02:18.133
strangers are tampering
with your candy

02:18.167 --> 02:20.000
is a straight-up
urban myth.

02:20.033 --> 02:21.333
I'll show you!

02:21.367 --> 02:23.533
I said scare me,
not teach me!

02:23.567 --> 02:25.733
Americans seem to think
there's an epidemic

02:25.767 --> 02:28.500
of crazy kooks
contaminating candy.

02:28.533 --> 02:30.300
Halloween is
my Christmas!

02:30.333 --> 02:32.967
For randomly poisoning
children, that is!

02:33.000 --> 02:35.367
(Adam)
As a result,
parents treat Halloween

02:35.400 --> 02:37.333
like a major
security event.

02:37.367 --> 02:39.133
(beeping)

02:39.167 --> 02:40.300
Hold the line!

02:40.333 --> 02:42.033
(ringing)
We have
an unwrapped treat here.

02:42.067 --> 02:43.500
And it's no wonder,

02:43.533 --> 02:46.000
because the media repeats
this terrifying tale

02:46.033 --> 02:48.633
over and over again.

02:48.667 --> 02:50.167
(reporter)
Disturbing warning
for all parents,

02:50.200 --> 02:52.333
please check your children's
Halloween candy.

02:52.367 --> 02:54.800
(second reporter)
If the candy feels,
smells, or looks weird,

02:54.833 --> 02:56.900
or has been opened,
toss it.

02:56.933 --> 02:58.700
(third reporter)
Parents can check
the candy from the outside,

02:58.733 --> 03:01.800
of course, and it can also be
checked from the inside.

03:01.833 --> 03:06.000
So just take your candy in
for free and have it x-rayed.

03:06.033 --> 03:08.333
See? Strangers are
out to kill me,

03:08.367 --> 03:10.400
and since I've survived
the assassination attempts

03:10.433 --> 03:11.967
my entire life,

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
that must mean
I am immortal.

03:15.033 --> 03:16.500
Nope!
Aww.

03:16.533 --> 03:19.333
This spooky story
just isn't true.

03:19.367 --> 03:23.233
There has never been
a single documented report found

03:23.267 --> 03:25.667
of a stranger
seriously harming a child

03:25.700 --> 03:27.800
by poisoning
their Halloween candy.

03:27.833 --> 03:29.733
Sounds like something
a stranger would say.

03:29.767 --> 03:32.200
Well, I say it too.
(screams)

03:33.500 --> 03:35.667
Ooh, now that was scary.

03:35.700 --> 03:37.167
This is Joel Best.

03:37.200 --> 03:39.467
He's a professor
at the University of Delaware

03:39.500 --> 03:40.900
who's been studying
reports of strangers

03:40.933 --> 03:43.500
tampering with candy
for over 30 years.

03:43.533 --> 03:46.000
Oh.
Less scary.

03:46.033 --> 03:48.867
The tampered candy story has
no basis in fact.

03:48.900 --> 03:52.533
Two separate reports looked
into claims of tampered candy

03:52.567 --> 03:55.667
and concluded that virtually
all of them were hoaxes.

03:55.700 --> 03:57.833
And, if a child were
killed this way,

03:57.867 --> 03:59.567
it would be
a major news story.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.300
Yet I've never found
any evidence

04:01.333 --> 04:03.800
of such a story being
covered by major media.

04:03.833 --> 04:06.533
The fact is,
there is no evidence

04:06.567 --> 04:10.000
that any child has ever been
killed or seriously hurt

04:10.033 --> 04:12.500
by tampered candy
received from a stranger

04:12.533 --> 04:14.033
during trick-or-treating.

04:14.067 --> 04:17.367
But... why would everyone
be scared for nothing?

04:17.400 --> 04:20.467
Well, this story plays
into fears we already have.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.333
Warnings about
Halloween candy

04:22.367 --> 04:24.200
tend to be most acute
during years

04:24.233 --> 04:25.800
when there's been
a terrible crime

04:25.833 --> 04:27.233
or a shift in culture

04:27.267 --> 04:28.833
that heightens
everyone's fears.

04:28.867 --> 04:32.300
For instance, the Tylenol
poisonings of 1982 caused

04:32.333 --> 04:35.633
fears of contaminated candy
to spike, and after 9/11,

04:35.667 --> 04:37.233
people suddenly
became nervous

04:37.267 --> 04:38.467
about trick-or-treating

04:38.500 --> 04:41.233
in large buildings
like local malls.

04:41.267 --> 04:42.833
Malls?

04:42.867 --> 04:45.333
What a boring place
to be afraid of.

04:45.367 --> 04:48.500
The poisoned candy story is
a modern day fairy tale.

04:48.533 --> 04:51.633
In olden times,
when people were afraid
of the forest,

04:51.667 --> 04:54.500
spooky stories were set
in the deep, dark woods.

04:54.533 --> 04:57.900
Today, our greatest fear
seems to be of strangers,

04:57.933 --> 05:00.967
and since kids interact
with strangers on Halloween,

05:01.000 --> 05:02.967
that's what
our urban legends are about.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.333
Thanks, Joel.

05:04.367 --> 05:05.367
Wait, don't put the lid on,

05:05.400 --> 05:07.033
then my candle
will go out!

05:08.400 --> 05:10.467
Right!
Stranger danger.

05:10.500 --> 05:12.833
Even if strangers aren't
poisoning our candy,

05:12.867 --> 05:16.533
they still have
unmarked vans.

05:16.567 --> 05:19.633
Actually,
our fear of strangers
is way overblown.

05:19.667 --> 05:20.967
Ugh!

05:21.000 --> 05:24.633
Only 1% of missing children
in 2016 were abducted

05:24.667 --> 05:26.200
by a non-family-member,

05:26.233 --> 05:28.467
and the vast majority
of offenders charged

05:28.500 --> 05:31.833
with crimes against children
targeted a child they knew.

05:31.867 --> 05:34.667
In fact, the only
documented report

05:34.700 --> 05:37.500
of a kid actually dying from
poisoned Halloween candy...

05:37.533 --> 05:39.733
(doorbell ringing)
Trick or treat.

05:39.767 --> 05:41.500
...was when it was
given to him by...

05:41.533 --> 05:44.133
Here you are... son.

05:44.167 --> 05:46.667
(thunder crashes)
...his own father.

05:46.700 --> 05:48.967
Whoa.
The fact is,

05:49.000 --> 05:51.167
there are threats
to kids' safety out there

05:51.200 --> 05:53.033
that we need
to be mindful of.

05:53.067 --> 05:55.633
But our cultural
fear of strangers is

05:55.667 --> 05:58.167
totally out of sync
with the real risks.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.900
You don't need to be afraid
of your Halloween candy.

06:00.933 --> 06:02.400
It's actually quite safe.

06:02.433 --> 06:04.367
I don't want safe!

06:04.400 --> 06:06.033
The only reason
I liked trick-or-treating

06:06.067 --> 06:07.733
was because
it was scary.

06:07.767 --> 06:10.700
Halloween is supposed
to be terrifying.

06:10.733 --> 06:13.633
Like when my hero,
Orson Welles,

06:13.667 --> 06:15.900
terrorized the nation
with his infamous

06:15.933 --> 06:17.500
"War of the Worlds" broadcast.

06:17.533 --> 06:19.300
People were running
in the streets,

06:19.333 --> 06:20.800
afraid for their lives!

06:20.833 --> 06:22.800
It was mass chaos!

06:22.833 --> 06:24.333
(cackling)

06:24.367 --> 06:26.800
Oh, none of those things
actually happened.

06:26.833 --> 06:28.633
Let me tell you about it.

06:28.667 --> 06:30.500
Jeez Louise,
you are the only person

06:30.533 --> 06:32.733
who uses magic
to be more boring.

06:36.933 --> 06:38.133
(static, indistinct voices)

06:38.167 --> 06:40.067
Back to Orson Welles
and the Mercury Theater

06:40.100 --> 06:41.800
in "War of the Worlds."

06:41.833 --> 06:43.400
Yes, my favorite!

06:43.433 --> 06:45.000
When Orson Welles
first broadcast

06:45.033 --> 06:46.333
"The War of the Worlds"

06:46.367 --> 06:48.400
on the night before
Halloween, 1938.

06:48.433 --> 06:51.567
It told a terrifying story
of a Martian invasion.

06:53.033 --> 06:56.500
We know now that in the early
years of the 20th century,

06:56.533 --> 06:58.500
this world was being
watched closely

06:58.533 --> 07:00.833
by intelligences
greater than man's.

07:00.867 --> 07:04.033
(eerie note)

07:05.567 --> 07:08.333
The poisoned Martian smoke has
reached Times Square!

07:08.367 --> 07:10.667
People are trying to run away
from it, but it's no use!

07:10.700 --> 07:12.800
They're falling
like flies.

07:12.833 --> 07:16.500
(boy)
And the best part is,
everyone bought it.

07:16.533 --> 07:18.867
I'm confusing fantasy
and reality.

07:18.900 --> 07:21.133
Martians are real,
and I'm terrified.

07:21.167 --> 07:25.000
I'd better run out
into the street and riot!

07:25.033 --> 07:27.833
The entire country
descended into chaos,

07:27.867 --> 07:31.200
terrified by Orson Welles,
my hero.

07:31.233 --> 07:33.000
(Adam)
Yes, that's the story
we've been told,

07:33.033 --> 07:36.300
but the spine-tingling truth
is it never happened.

07:36.333 --> 07:38.967
What? Adam,
get out of my radio.

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
Tonight, A.R.E. Radio Theater
presents the true story

07:44.033 --> 07:46.333
of "The War of the Worlds."

07:46.367 --> 07:49.367
(eerie note)

07:51.700 --> 07:55.033
Yeah, radio makes sense for you.
You have the face for it.

07:55.067 --> 07:57.833
Now, the story
of the radio program

07:57.867 --> 08:00.633
that panicked a nation
has been told for decades.

08:00.667 --> 08:02.733
But there's
very little evidence

08:02.767 --> 08:05.400
that any such panic
actually occurred.

08:05.433 --> 08:08.167
Our tale begins
with the hair-raising fact

08:08.200 --> 08:11.500
that very few people even heard
"The War of the Worlds,"

08:11.533 --> 08:13.000
because it aired
at the same time

08:13.033 --> 08:15.500
as one of the most popular
radio shows in the country,

08:15.533 --> 08:18.700
ventriloquist Edgar Bergen's
comedy hour.

08:18.733 --> 08:20.200
Say hello, Charlie.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.533
"Hello, Charlie."

08:22.867 --> 08:24.533
I like it cause
he doesn't move his mouth.

08:24.567 --> 08:27.067
I assume.
It is the radio.

08:27.100 --> 08:30.700
Wow, people must've been
really bored in the past.

08:30.733 --> 08:34.333
In fact, a survey conducted
that very night found that

08:34.367 --> 08:38.400
only 2% of Americans even heard
"The War of the Worlds."

08:38.433 --> 08:40.700
(whistling down)

08:40.733 --> 08:42.167
Only 2%?

08:42.200 --> 08:43.867
Then why did everyone riot?

08:43.900 --> 08:45.467
Well, the fact is,

08:45.500 --> 08:48.000
we're not sure
anyone actually did.

08:48.033 --> 08:51.033
After the broadcast,
newspapers did describe

08:51.067 --> 08:52.500
chaos in the streets.

08:52.533 --> 08:53.667
Extry! Extry!

08:53.700 --> 08:56.000
"War of the Worlds"
causes mass panic...

08:56.033 --> 08:58.000
is what we'd like you
to believe.

08:58.033 --> 09:01.800
(screams)

09:01.833 --> 09:04.667
Riot! Aah!
Did you hear the radio?!

09:04.700 --> 09:05.900
Yes, I heard
the radio!

09:05.933 --> 09:07.633
But later
eyewitness accounts

09:07.667 --> 09:10.333
said that cities were
actually calm that night.

09:10.367 --> 09:12.333
I don't know
what he's talking about.

09:12.367 --> 09:15.167
Those streets were emptier than
my dance card on a Friday night.

09:15.200 --> 09:17.567
(cricket chirping)

09:19.700 --> 09:21.400
And there were
no follow-up reports

09:21.433 --> 09:23.967
of any deaths
or serious injuries.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.333
It seemed that newspapers
were just sensationalizing

09:26.367 --> 09:28.067
a few anecdotal accounts.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.733
So, it was 1930s clickbait?

09:30.767 --> 09:32.000
Why would they make that up?

09:32.033 --> 09:35.167
Because these ink-stained
wretches saw the radio

09:35.200 --> 09:36.733
as their competition.

09:36.767 --> 09:39.667
The radio could report
the news instantly.

09:39.700 --> 09:42.333
So, it was a threat
to the newspapers' business.

09:45.733 --> 09:47.233
Here I am in the newsroom,

09:47.267 --> 09:49.867
ready to type my story
about the Hindenburg crash,

09:49.900 --> 09:51.333
now to turn on the radio

09:51.367 --> 09:52.900
and get some
background music.

09:52.933 --> 09:55.333
Mommy!
Ehrhrhr--

09:55.367 --> 09:57.533
It's a home run!
Ehrhrhr--

09:57.567 --> 09:58.900
Ladies and gentlemen,
a terrible tragedy,

09:58.933 --> 10:01.733
the Hindenburg has crashed,
oh, the humanity!

10:01.767 --> 10:03.967
Ahh, scooped again
by the radio.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.167
We gotta find a way to make
these Marconi maroons

10:06.200 --> 10:07.500
sound unreliable.

10:07.533 --> 10:09.533
Think, think,
think, think...

10:09.567 --> 10:11.033
I got it!

10:11.067 --> 10:13.233
So newspapers seized
on "The War of the Worlds"

10:13.267 --> 10:16.000
as an opportunity
to discredit the radio.

10:16.033 --> 10:17.533
They published
anecdotal accounts

10:17.567 --> 10:19.700
of the few people
who were fooled--

10:19.733 --> 10:22.333
Hmm, my brother's boss's uncle
said that he believed it.

10:22.367 --> 10:23.800
I'll put that in the story.

10:23.833 --> 10:27.200
And published
anti-radio editorials.

10:27.233 --> 10:29.667
(reciting)

10:36.600 --> 10:38.067
(scrape, ding)

10:38.100 --> 10:41.500
This manipulative myth was
repeated again and again

10:41.533 --> 10:43.700
until Americans
actually believed

10:43.733 --> 10:45.533
there had been
a real mass panic.

10:45.567 --> 10:48.967
My word, you can't trust
anything you hear on the radio.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.167
Are ventriloquists fake too?

10:51.200 --> 10:54.067
The public bought
this story so thoroughly

10:54.100 --> 10:56.333
that decades later,
when Orson Welles was

10:56.367 --> 10:58.333
on the radio
during the Pearl Harbor attack,

10:58.367 --> 11:00.433
people thought
he was faking that, too.

11:00.467 --> 11:02.500
I am shocked to announce

11:02.533 --> 11:05.333
American forces have been
attacked at Pearl Harbor.

11:05.367 --> 11:08.500
Yeah, right, fool us once,
Bore-son Smells.

11:08.533 --> 11:11.300
Ahh, yes, see if I care.

11:11.333 --> 11:14.333
I'm gonna get drunk
and do commercials for peas.

11:14.367 --> 11:16.333
That's not scary.

11:16.367 --> 11:17.400
That's sad.

11:17.433 --> 11:19.067
Orson, who are you?

11:20.367 --> 11:21.833
The irony is,

11:21.867 --> 11:24.167
the newspapers were
actually right,

11:24.200 --> 11:26.667
the public really was
at risk of being fooled

11:26.700 --> 11:28.633
by an unscrupulous media.

11:28.667 --> 11:30.567
But it wasn't the radio.

11:30.600 --> 11:33.533
The true villains were
the newspapers themselves.

11:33.567 --> 11:37.167
And that is
the scariest story of all.

11:37.200 --> 11:39.000
(cackling)
No, it isn't.

11:39.033 --> 11:41.067
The original story was
way scarier.

11:41.100 --> 11:43.233
That was just a lesson
on journalism ethics.

11:43.267 --> 11:45.833
I'm tired of lies
and hoaxes.

11:45.867 --> 11:47.500
I want something real
on Halloween.

11:47.533 --> 11:49.833
Something terrifying.

11:49.867 --> 11:52.200
(static crackling)

11:55.367 --> 11:56.833
Okay, here's the deal.

11:56.867 --> 11:58.300
I can talk to the dead,

11:58.333 --> 11:59.667
and I'm on TV.

11:59.700 --> 12:01.800
Hold on, I'm feeling a presence.

12:01.833 --> 12:04.967
It's Napoleon,
he's says I'm for real.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.533
Like her, people who can
reach across dimensions

12:07.567 --> 12:08.833
and speak to the dead.

12:08.867 --> 12:10.333
Now, that's scary.

12:10.367 --> 12:12.367
Oh, mediums are
the biggest hoaxes.

12:12.400 --> 12:13.867
They don't talk
to the dead at all.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.367
I wish
you couldn't talk to me.

12:23.167 --> 12:26.167
Shut up, okay, welcome back
to "The Jersey Shore-acle."

12:26.200 --> 12:28.733
I transcend dimensions,
I speak to spirits,

12:28.767 --> 12:30.533
I live off Exit Nine
off the turnpike.

12:30.567 --> 12:32.733
So, today, I have been
summoned to the home

12:32.767 --> 12:33.967
of an adorable little boy

12:34.000 --> 12:35.800
and his adult friend
who he barely knows.

12:35.833 --> 12:39.000
My name is Stuart,
and I'm 12 years old.

12:39.033 --> 12:41.233
I'd say
I'm a pretty happy kid.

12:41.267 --> 12:44.567
That is,
until it showed up.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.033
Its name is Adam,

12:46.067 --> 12:48.533
and he's making Halloween
really not scary.

12:48.567 --> 12:50.000
Eh.

12:50.033 --> 12:51.700
So I'm hoping
the Jersey Shore-acle

12:51.733 --> 12:53.467
can connect me
with a dead relative.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.000
Or a murderer.

12:55.033 --> 12:56.700
Whichever's more terrifying.

12:56.733 --> 12:59.733
Hello, it's so nice
to meet you.

12:59.767 --> 13:01.667
Thank you for having me.
I sensed you needed it,

13:01.700 --> 13:03.500
good, you sat down, okay,

13:03.533 --> 13:06.233
we're gonna start this,
are you ready?
Yeah.

13:06.267 --> 13:07.667
All right,
now before we start,

13:07.700 --> 13:09.633
I do have a couple
of questions, okay?

13:09.667 --> 13:11.067
I need you to tell me--

13:11.100 --> 13:13.900
That mediums are scammers who
prey on your grief for money?

13:13.933 --> 13:15.400
What is this?

13:15.433 --> 13:18.533
It's in my contract no one
can have bigger hair than me.

13:18.567 --> 13:20.867
Adam, she's going
to contact the dead for me.

13:20.900 --> 13:22.733
It's an age-old tradition.

13:22.767 --> 13:25.000
It sure is,
a tradition of faking it

13:25.033 --> 13:27.033
and ripping people off.

13:27.067 --> 13:29.500
Séances first became
popular in America

13:29.533 --> 13:31.167
during the 19th century,

13:31.200 --> 13:33.800
when three young ladies
named the Fox sisters

13:33.833 --> 13:35.233
started charging admission

13:35.267 --> 13:37.900
to watch them
communicate with the dead.

13:37.933 --> 13:40.667
If there be any ghosts
in this room,

13:40.700 --> 13:42.033
may they knock.

13:42.067 --> 13:43.467
(knock knock knock)

13:43.500 --> 13:46.367
And if those ghosts think
people should give us money,

13:46.400 --> 13:47.833
also knock.

13:47.867 --> 13:50.400
(knocking)
(gasps)

13:50.433 --> 13:53.167
As they grew up,
the Fox sisters became

13:53.200 --> 13:54.967
bona-fide celebrities,

13:55.000 --> 13:56.967
touring and holding
packed sessions

13:57.000 --> 13:58.667
multiple times a day.

13:58.700 --> 14:01.733
Sorry, darling,
we couldn't possibly fit you in,

14:01.767 --> 14:05.633
we're talking to Shakespeare
and Attila the Hun at noon.

14:05.667 --> 14:08.633
But later in life,
Maggie Fox spilled the beans

14:08.667 --> 14:10.667
and revealed
how they tricked their public,

14:10.700 --> 14:13.300
making knocking sounds
using an apple on a string

14:13.333 --> 14:16.833
and writing secret messages
with their feet.

14:16.867 --> 14:19.500
I feel the spirit...

14:19.533 --> 14:21.667
wait for it...

14:21.700 --> 14:24.833
(Adam)
Despite Maggie's confession,
the spiritualism movement

14:24.867 --> 14:26.200
continued to this day,

14:26.233 --> 14:28.633
and modern mediums
still make bank.

14:28.667 --> 14:31.333
Famous mediums even
have best-selling books

14:31.367 --> 14:32.967
and hit TV shows.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
Yes, TV shows
that are totally real!

14:36.033 --> 14:37.667
That's right,
the higher the hair,
the closer to heaven,

14:37.700 --> 14:39.667
okay, enough chit-chat,
let's start this reading.

14:41.267 --> 14:44.367
Oh, yeah, I'm feeling
something very powerful.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.033
Oh, yeah,
it's a presence.

14:46.067 --> 14:48.000
Did you lose someone
with a J name,

14:48.033 --> 14:50.000
like a John,
a Jack, a Julia--

14:50.033 --> 14:52.067
Yes, my grandpa's
name was Jason.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.567
Bam! That's it.

14:53.600 --> 14:55.867
Okay-- oh, oh...

14:55.900 --> 14:57.133
oh, I'm feeling a pain.

14:57.167 --> 14:59.333
Oh, yeah,
in my chestal area.

14:59.367 --> 15:03.500
Is there any type of thing that
happened in that region area?

15:03.533 --> 15:05.867
Yes, he-- he died
of lung cancer.

15:05.900 --> 15:07.800
Bada-bingo, what you
think about that,

15:07.833 --> 15:09.167
Mr. Everything, huh?

15:09.200 --> 15:12.333
Okay, so...
your grandfather's
telling me, oh,

15:12.367 --> 15:14.100
something about
a book, why?

15:15.200 --> 15:16.567
Why?
Uh...

15:16.600 --> 15:18.500
I think he owned a book.

15:20.067 --> 15:22.867
And I saw it once.
That's it.
That's it.

15:22.900 --> 15:25.300
He wants me to tell you
he cherishes those moments,

15:25.333 --> 15:26.367
and he loves you.

15:26.400 --> 15:27.800
Boom, shut up, I'm done.

15:27.833 --> 15:31.333
That was amazing!

15:31.367 --> 15:33.200
How do you explain that?

15:33.233 --> 15:36.167
Simple, she was
doing a cold reading.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.167
Uh... who this?

15:38.200 --> 15:39.733
You're not a spirit,
I did not summon you.

15:39.767 --> 15:41.000
Okay, can we cut?

15:41.033 --> 15:43.200
(bell ringing)
This is Mark Edward.

15:43.233 --> 15:46.233
He's a magician who went
undercover as a psychic medium

15:46.267 --> 15:48.700
to research
how they scam people.

15:48.733 --> 15:51.500
I used to do everything
she does for a living,

15:51.533 --> 15:54.500
and I can tell you
exactly how it's done.

15:54.533 --> 15:57.400
Cold reading is a series
of questions and statements

15:57.433 --> 16:00.967
that mine you for information,
without you even knowing it.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
First, the medium lists

16:03.033 --> 16:04.833
common names
to guess at a match.

16:04.867 --> 16:07.167
And they start
with just the initial

16:07.200 --> 16:09.333
so that you fill in
the blank.

16:09.367 --> 16:11.167
Oh. Yeah.

16:11.200 --> 16:13.533
I know tons of people
with J names.

16:13.567 --> 16:14.900
And lots of them are dead.

16:14.933 --> 16:18.567
Mediums then offer details
which sound specific

16:18.600 --> 16:20.900
but are actually
quite generic.

16:20.933 --> 16:23.700
Chest pains could be
lung cancer, heart disease,

16:23.733 --> 16:25.133
or really anything.

16:25.167 --> 16:27.833
No, no, I sensed that
he died because of

16:27.867 --> 16:29.300
something in the chest.

16:29.333 --> 16:30.667
Or the head.

16:30.700 --> 16:32.833
Uh-huh? Definitely
somewhere in the body.

16:32.867 --> 16:36.333
Finally, she offered a question
phrased like a statement

16:36.367 --> 16:39.400
to make you do the work
and make a connection.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.667
Honey, sugar, the book.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.233
It was real, right?

16:43.267 --> 16:45.033
Actually, no.

16:45.067 --> 16:46.500
Grandpa hated books.

16:46.533 --> 16:48.900
Now that I'm thinking of it,
I was thinking of his TV Guide.

16:48.933 --> 16:51.700
By using questions
that could apply to anyone

16:51.733 --> 16:55.033
and judging your body language
to see how you respond,

16:55.067 --> 16:57.500
mediums manipulate you

16:57.533 --> 17:01.000
into thinking they know things
nobody else could know.

17:01.033 --> 17:03.467
And since they often work
in group settings,

17:03.500 --> 17:04.733
if they don't get it right,

17:04.767 --> 17:07.033
they just move on
to someone else in the room.

17:07.067 --> 17:09.400
I mean, how about you, haircut?
You know something about a book?

17:09.433 --> 17:12.700
No-- somebody here must know
something about a book.

17:12.733 --> 17:13.967
Ugh!

17:14.000 --> 17:15.567
Why did I ever buy this?

17:15.600 --> 17:18.533
Well, cold reading
often seems supernatural

17:18.567 --> 17:21.200
because it's a truly
amazing skill.

17:21.233 --> 17:22.833
But that's all it is.

17:22.867 --> 17:24.300
A really good magic trick.

17:24.333 --> 17:26.667
And while there's nothing wrong
with a little illusion,

17:26.700 --> 17:28.867
it is straight-up unethical

17:28.900 --> 17:30.567
to take advantage
of other people's grief

17:30.600 --> 17:32.000
for your own gain.

17:32.033 --> 17:35.000
I've even seen people lose
their entire savings

17:35.033 --> 17:38.233
because a medium convinced them
to hand it over.

17:39.500 --> 17:42.367
You scammer!
How do you even
sleep at night?

17:42.400 --> 17:43.567
Okay, calm down.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.000
Everyone just
take a minute,

17:45.033 --> 17:48.333
close your eyes, okay,
just imagine smoke or whatever.

17:48.367 --> 17:50.200
Poof, I'm gone.

17:52.167 --> 17:54.167
It's time for me
to go, too.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.000
Just kidding.

17:58.033 --> 17:59.667
It's an editing trick.

17:59.700 --> 18:01.367
Ugh!

18:01.400 --> 18:02.400
Nerds!

18:02.433 --> 18:04.067
I'm surrounded by nerds!

18:04.100 --> 18:07.200
I thought this was going to be
the scariest Halloween ever,

18:07.233 --> 18:09.700
but apparently
it's all a big fake!

18:09.733 --> 18:11.133
I want chaos!

18:11.167 --> 18:12.400
I want horror!

18:12.433 --> 18:14.667
I wanna be so terrified
my hair turns white,

18:14.700 --> 18:16.367
and I pee my pants!

18:16.400 --> 18:18.733
I wanna be scared
for real.

18:18.767 --> 18:22.067
Well, be careful
what you wish for, Stuart,

18:22.100 --> 18:24.133
because the truth is...

18:24.167 --> 18:27.333
there's plenty to be
scared of on Halloween.

18:27.367 --> 18:29.067
(thunder crashes)
(screaming)

18:29.100 --> 18:30.533
Oh, wow, did that
actually frighten you?

18:30.567 --> 18:33.833
No, I just realized
you're gonna be here longer.

18:41.267 --> 18:42.867
Strangers aren't
poisoning candy.

18:42.900 --> 18:44.667
No one can talk to the dead.

18:44.700 --> 18:46.500
And Orson Welles didn't even
make people panic

18:46.533 --> 18:47.967
with "The War of the Worlds."

18:48.000 --> 18:50.367
Nothing is scary,
because everything's fake.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.667
You're right, you don't
need to be scared of

18:52.700 --> 18:54.000
any of that fake stuff.

18:54.033 --> 18:55.167
Because the truth is,

18:55.200 --> 18:58.300
the real world is
the scariest of all.

18:58.333 --> 19:01.000
What do you mean?
Think about it.

19:01.033 --> 19:03.867
Even though there was
no mass panic over a radio play,

19:03.900 --> 19:05.667
the story of
"The War of the Worlds"

19:05.700 --> 19:08.200
shows how easily
we can be manipulated

19:08.233 --> 19:09.700
to distrust others.

19:11.200 --> 19:13.000
I lied to the public
to slander my enemies,

19:13.033 --> 19:14.833
and they all believed me.

19:14.867 --> 19:16.167
Ooh.

19:16.200 --> 19:18.467
And, no, talking
to ghosts isn't real,

19:18.500 --> 19:20.400
but you know
what's even scarier?

19:20.433 --> 19:23.133
People who take advantage
of our grief and trust

19:23.167 --> 19:24.967
for their own gain.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
I turned your precious memories
of your grandfather into cash,

19:28.033 --> 19:29.967
bada-bing,
bada-Bruce-Springsteen.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.633
Ugh, that's such
a broad stereotype.

19:32.667 --> 19:35.633
And remember that father
who poisoned his own son's

19:35.667 --> 19:38.367
Halloween candy?
Yes, why did he do it?

19:38.400 --> 19:41.000
For the insurance money.

19:41.033 --> 19:43.867
See? We don't need
to make up ghosts

19:43.900 --> 19:46.833
or aliens
or creepy strangers
to be afraid of.

19:46.867 --> 19:49.833
The cruel things
ordinary people do

19:49.867 --> 19:52.200
to each other are
scary enough.

19:52.233 --> 19:57.033
The real everyday world is
darker and more sinister

19:57.067 --> 19:59.333
than anything
you can imagine.

19:59.367 --> 20:01.133
(thunder crashes)

20:01.167 --> 20:04.367
That's... terrifying.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.700
You're welcome.

20:08.033 --> 20:10.733
**

20:15.867 --> 20:17.733
And then he said that
we can't talk to ghosts,

20:17.767 --> 20:19.333
and-- and strangers
aren't evil,

20:19.367 --> 20:23.400
and in the past, everyone loved
ventriloquists on the radio.

20:23.433 --> 20:28.000
Oh, honey, I promise you,
nobody likes ventriloquists.

20:28.033 --> 20:29.833
Who was this guy again?

20:29.867 --> 20:31.400
His name was Adam.

20:31.433 --> 20:34.800
He had big hair
and-- and glasses.

20:34.833 --> 20:37.367
A smile like an uncarved
jack-o-lantern.

20:37.400 --> 20:40.667
Wait-- did you meet
Adam Conover?

20:40.700 --> 20:42.367
From "Adam Ruins
Everything"?

20:42.400 --> 20:43.700
Yeah.

20:45.533 --> 20:48.800
(thunder crashes)

20:48.833 --> 20:50.333
Stuart...

20:52.067 --> 20:54.367
"Adam Ruins Everything"

20:54.400 --> 20:57.033
has been canceled
for 50 years.

20:57.067 --> 20:58.033
(thunder crashes)

20:58.067 --> 20:59.867
Aah!

21:03.267 --> 21:05.733
(distorted cackling)

21:07.867 --> 21:10.300
**

21:10.333 --> 21:12.400
Hello, everybody,
I'm here on set

21:12.433 --> 21:14.667
on "Adam Ruins Everything,"
'cause I got way more questions

21:14.700 --> 21:17.200
for Mark Edward, so we got
to know more about this.

21:17.233 --> 21:20.000
You are a magician,
but you worked as a psychic.

21:20.033 --> 21:22.167
Well, because
my background is in magic,

21:22.200 --> 21:23.500
so I started to see

21:23.533 --> 21:25.667
what psychics
and mediums were doing.

21:25.700 --> 21:27.067
And I looked at them,

21:27.100 --> 21:29.000
and I knew that
it was just a trick.

21:29.033 --> 21:32.000
There was no metaphysical,
spiritual thing going on.

21:32.033 --> 21:36.500
So I was fascinated by why
people would buy into it.

21:36.533 --> 21:39.867
So, how are magic
and psychics similar?

21:39.900 --> 21:41.233
How are the fields
similar and different?

21:41.267 --> 21:43.833
Well, because
it's a performance art.

21:43.867 --> 21:45.333
Mmm.
The only difference is

21:45.367 --> 21:48.500
magic is props
and colorful things.

21:48.533 --> 21:52.067
Whereas psychics
manipulate emotions.

21:52.100 --> 21:55.167
A magician is in a venue,
you know it's a show.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.500
And when you leave,
you know you've seen

21:57.533 --> 21:58.900
a performance
of a magic show.

21:58.933 --> 22:00.567
Mm-hmm.
But, for psychics,

22:00.600 --> 22:02.833
the stage show,
or the show that you see,

22:02.867 --> 22:06.667
that is only a prerequisite
to get in your wallet.

22:06.700 --> 22:08.333
What they wanna do is
they want you to see

22:08.367 --> 22:11.000
them perform and get
all these incredible hits

22:11.033 --> 22:13.833
and be-- be correct
so that they can get you,

22:13.867 --> 22:15.667
they say later,
at the end of the show,

22:15.700 --> 22:16.967
"If you'd like
a private reading,

22:17.000 --> 22:18.700
come and talk
to my assistant."

22:18.733 --> 22:20.833
Oh.
Then they start
to get a hook in you,

22:20.867 --> 22:22.133
because the people
that come to them

22:22.167 --> 22:23.533
for a private
reading afterwards,

22:23.567 --> 22:25.733
that's where the money is.

22:25.767 --> 22:27.567
Now a lot of people say
about mediums, they say,

22:27.600 --> 22:29.567
"Hey, they're not
hurting anyone.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.167
Maybe they're helping
those people."
Right.

22:31.200 --> 22:33.167
"Maybe they're
giving them closure--"
Sure.

22:33.200 --> 22:35.000
"They're helping them come
to terms with the death."

22:35.033 --> 22:37.633
What do you think about that?
I think that usually
the people that say that

22:37.667 --> 22:39.700
are not the ones
that've been ripped off.

22:39.733 --> 22:42.667
Mmm.
There are people
who think they are

22:42.700 --> 22:45.067
seeing somebody
be helped by it.

22:45.100 --> 22:47.667
But most of the people
who... are bereaved

22:47.700 --> 22:48.800
and who are of loss or--

22:48.833 --> 22:50.833
a murdered child
or anything like that,

22:50.867 --> 22:54.167
they want any kind of
information they can get

22:54.200 --> 22:55.833
so they're
very vulnerable.

22:55.867 --> 22:57.700
Right, 'cause
if you don't want to accept

22:57.733 --> 22:59.167
that that person's
gone from your life,

22:59.200 --> 23:00.767
and you can go
to that psychic every week,

23:00.800 --> 23:02.733
and-- and they'll give you
a new message from that person.

23:02.767 --> 23:04.700
That's right,
that's right.
You'll come back
week after week.

23:04.733 --> 23:06.867
And you have to remember,
the more times you do it,

23:06.900 --> 23:09.800
the more that person has
picked up on little

23:09.833 --> 23:12.500
telltale signs
that allow them

23:12.533 --> 23:14.700
to make these
psychological leaps,

23:14.733 --> 23:16.700
and then you hear
my favorite phrase,

23:16.733 --> 23:18.467
which I've heard
thousands of times,

23:18.500 --> 23:20.300
which is, "There is
no way in the world

23:20.333 --> 23:22.000
he could've
known that about me."

23:22.033 --> 23:24.667
They're selling hope.
It's just like a drug.

23:24.700 --> 23:26.133
It's like an addiction.

23:26.167 --> 23:27.700
You want more,
you want more,

23:27.733 --> 23:30.233
little bits, they feed
little bits, little bits.

23:30.267 --> 23:33.533
The medium takes away
that person's...

23:33.567 --> 23:36.833
real chance
to get over that

23:36.867 --> 23:38.200
and-- and grieve.

23:38.233 --> 23:40.800
Is there any ethical way
to be a psychic?

23:40.833 --> 23:43.333
If you find somebody
you can sit down and talk to,

23:43.367 --> 23:45.667
and they can give you
some advice...

23:45.700 --> 23:47.500
I don't have
a problem with that.

23:47.533 --> 23:50.067
There are 5% of people
out there who are

23:50.100 --> 23:52.167
compassionate,
kind individuals,

23:52.200 --> 23:54.667
who really are
just intuitive.

23:54.700 --> 23:57.333
See? But when you
balance the 5%

23:57.367 --> 24:00.467
against the 95%
of all the scumbags,

24:00.500 --> 24:03.067
it's-- it's kind of
like "buyer beware."

24:03.100 --> 24:05.400
I mean, I used to tell people
that one of the things,

24:05.433 --> 24:07.400
when I was on the phone,
is I messed around with

24:07.433 --> 24:10.333
the idea of throwing
some skepticism into it.

24:10.367 --> 24:12.367
Just to see if--
what people would say.
Hmm.

24:12.400 --> 24:14.167
They would say,
"I need some lotto numbers."

24:14.200 --> 24:16.300
And I'd say, okay,
here's some lotto numbers.

24:16.333 --> 24:18.033
And they're like, "Gee,
thanks, thanks a lot."

24:18.067 --> 24:20.567
And then I'd say
"I didn't say they were
winning lotto numbers,"

24:20.600 --> 24:21.667
you know.
(laughing)

24:21.700 --> 24:22.800
And then
I would say to them,

24:22.833 --> 24:24.500
I would say, look,
if I could do this,

24:24.533 --> 24:26.500
why would I be talking
to you, you know?

24:26.533 --> 24:29.033
Use some common sense.
That's all this is.

24:29.067 --> 24:30.533
Well, thank you so much
for coming on the show

24:30.567 --> 24:31.900
to talk to us
about this, Mark.

24:31.933 --> 24:33.033
Thank you for having me.

24:33.067 --> 24:34.500
And thank you folks
for watching.

24:34.533 --> 24:35.933
We'll see you next time.
