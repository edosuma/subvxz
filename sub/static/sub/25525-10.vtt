"The Outpost...

00:01.412 --> 00:03.689
- I was injected by a Plagueling.
- You didn't turn.

00:03.776 --> 00:04.984
The vast majority of people

00:05.071 --> 00:06.669
would have been infected by now.

00:08.286 --> 00:10.317
I want this Outpost dry.

00:10.404 --> 00:11.886
And keep cutting every woman

00:11.973 --> 00:13.860
until we find the Blackblood.

00:15.262 --> 00:17.667
- That's colipsum.
- Why are they only offering it to him?

00:17.754 --> 00:20.039
No, you don't want
to eat me!

00:22.667 --> 00:23.985
I sent him to his death.

00:24.072 --> 00:26.284
It sacrificed its life
to save ours.

00:26.371 --> 00:28.472
This is Sill. 
She'll smuggle you out of here.

00:28.559 --> 00:31.176
We don't stand a chance
in a fair fight,

00:31.263 --> 00:33.451
so we don't give 'em
a fair fight.

00:33.912 --> 00:35.294
Oh!

00:36.935 --> 00:37.962
What is this?

00:38.049 --> 00:40.732
The Vex Rezicon.
The Book of Names.

00:40.819 --> 00:42.879
If you had access 
to all of these demon names,

00:42.966 --> 00:45.432
you could just summon
up a whole army of them.

00:53.185 --> 00:54.708
Oh!

00:58.259 --> 01:00.040
They're Plaguelings.

01:02.013 --> 01:04.828
No. No, no, no.
Greyskins did this.

01:05.191 --> 01:08.556
Well, at least they did it
to Plaguelings and not people.

01:10.922 --> 01:12.621
More flies.

01:30.151 --> 01:31.959
Is that colipsum?

01:37.056 --> 01:39.102
No, don't,
you silly boy!

01:39.548 --> 01:41.646
They're diptera eggs of some kind.

01:41.759 --> 01:43.828
- They're what?
- Fly eggs.

01:44.056 --> 01:46.157
Sure looks like
colipsum to me.

01:47.954 --> 01:49.860
They're one and the same.

01:50.751 --> 01:52.977
They're one
and the same.

01:55.025 --> 01:57.317
Fly eggs are colipsum.

01:57.556 --> 02:00.328
Colipsum
are fly eggs.

02:01.087 --> 02:02.858
And fly eggs are
colipsum.

02:02.945 --> 02:04.228
Wait...

02:04.569 --> 02:07.828
so if you have colipsum
in your blood,

02:08.195 --> 02:11.364
then you have fly eggs
in your blood.

02:12.341 --> 02:14.316
Oh, Gods, no.
No, what have I done?

02:14.403 --> 02:16.908
- Whoa, whoa, what? What?
- I'm a murderer, Garret.

02:16.995 --> 02:19.050
That's what.
I'm a murderer.

02:19.137 --> 02:21.808
Hundr... no, no,
thousands of times in.

02:21.895 --> 02:24.068
Janzo,
what are you talking about?

02:24.155 --> 02:25.500
If the flies are the females,

02:25.587 --> 02:28.127
the parasite in the
Plaguelings must be the male!

02:28.214 --> 02:31.152
If you have colipsum
in your blood, fly eggs,

02:31.239 --> 02:33.516
and you're injected by a Plagueling,

02:33.856 --> 02:36.174
then the venom fertilizes the eggs.

02:36.348 --> 02:38.681
And what? Makes baby Plaguelings?

02:38.768 --> 02:41.152
- Exactly.
- Are you saying...?

02:41.239 --> 02:42.603
But the females...

02:42.690 --> 02:45.399
the female hatchlings, well,
they turn into flies,

02:45.528 --> 02:47.418
and they produce
the green colipsum.

02:47.505 --> 02:49.063
The males, however, the males,

02:49.150 --> 02:51.113
they grow into a parasite

02:51.200 --> 02:53.266
that you see
in the throats of a human.

02:53.380 --> 02:55.196
What are you saying?

02:55.854 --> 02:58.235
That I haven't turned into
a Plagueling

02:58.442 --> 03:00.136
because I don't use colipsum?

03:00.223 --> 03:02.338
Exactly.
You're one of the lucky ones.

03:02.425 --> 03:06.281
However, thanks to me, so
many will not be as lucky.

03:06.598 --> 03:08.649
What do you mean,
thanks to you?

03:09.559 --> 03:11.293
Well, Talon and I went and
bought all

03:11.380 --> 03:12.828
of that colipsum from the Greyskins,

03:12.915 --> 03:15.174
enough to turn thousands
into Plaguelings.

03:15.261 --> 03:17.930
- You what?
- It's a long story.

03:20.114 --> 03:21.781
But you didn't know.

03:21.978 --> 03:23.996
But I knew it was bad,
Talon.

03:24.083 --> 03:26.768
I knew that I shouldn't
have anything to do with it.

03:26.855 --> 03:28.660
Now... now, how many people

03:28.747 --> 03:30.291
are gonna turn Plagueling
because of me, huh?

03:30.378 --> 03:31.742
But you figured it out,

03:32.070 --> 03:34.109
and now
we can stop it from spreading.

03:34.411 --> 03:37.542
We've got to hurry back to the
Outpost and destroy all of the colipsum

03:37.629 --> 03:39.087
and then warn
the rest of the Realm.

03:39.174 --> 03:40.977
No, wait, <i>wait!</i>

03:41.864 --> 03:47.023
Why... would Greyskins
tie up Plaguelings like this?

03:47.254 --> 03:49.417
- This is a farm.
- Sorry?

03:49.504 --> 03:51.023
They're making colipsum.

03:51.215 --> 03:52.339
They're harvesting it here

03:52.426 --> 03:54.640
and then they're selling
it to us across the border.

03:54.739 --> 03:57.758
But if this is a farm, then that
would mean that it's...

03:58.168 --> 03:59.363
it's a weapon.

03:59.450 --> 04:01.273
Oh, Gods, the Greyskins are

04:01.360 --> 04:04.008
using colipsum
as a weapon.

04:04.512 --> 04:07.734
They are trying to turn
us all into Plaguelings.

I, um, I... I don't think
I can make this climb.

04:41.002 --> 04:42.290
Tie yourself off.

04:42.377 --> 04:44.218
When we get to the
top, we'll pull you up.

04:44.305 --> 04:45.761
Right.

05:01.102 --> 05:02.368
All right.

05:09.563 --> 05:11.773
Welcome home.

05:12.903 --> 05:14.879
Ambassador Dred.

05:20.697 --> 05:23.310
- No.
- Pull him up.

05:25.277 --> 05:28.255
Wait, no. I'm not ready,
Garret! Let me down, Garret!

05:30.964 --> 05:34.295
Your friend is currently
dangling halfway up that wall.

05:34.510 --> 05:36.002
It would be a shame if my men

05:36.089 --> 05:38.164
had to let go of him
to defend themselves.

05:38.251 --> 05:41.897
Pull me up!
Pull me up!

05:42.175 --> 05:44.764
Talon, not now.

05:49.183 --> 05:50.526
Help!

05:54.048 --> 05:55.339
Oh.

05:57.504 --> 05:58.932
Talon.

06:31.302 --> 06:33.375
I can almost smell it...

06:33.802 --> 06:35.672
flowing in your vein.

06:49.215 --> 06:50.898
Incredible.

06:55.552 --> 06:57.594
As black as ink.

07:14.688 --> 07:18.324
You know, cutting off your
ears didn't make you human.

07:19.717 --> 07:21.840
Explain something to me.

07:22.196 --> 07:25.623
I was taught that Blackbloods
could summon their demon servants

07:25.710 --> 07:27.957
at any time
to destroy their enemies,

07:28.071 --> 07:32.387
but instead, your people died
cowering pitifully in the dust.

07:32.474 --> 07:33.554
Why is that?

07:33.641 --> 07:35.863
We were a peaceful colony.

07:37.114 --> 07:39.293
We weren't a threat to anyone.

07:39.712 --> 07:41.348
Which was disappointing,

07:41.438 --> 07:43.178
but now I am blessed with
another chance

07:43.265 --> 07:45.266
to prove that t
he stories are true,

07:45.353 --> 07:48.264
that the prophecy is real.

07:48.571 --> 07:51.106
I believe
you know these words.

07:55.052 --> 07:56.988
Say them out loud.

07:57.462 --> 07:58.966
Call your demon.

07:59.086 --> 08:01.527
If I did, it would tear
you and your men apart.

08:01.614 --> 08:04.371
I have 50 Covenant elite
standing ready.

08:05.055 --> 08:06.321
Not enough.

08:06.446 --> 08:09.129
Why don't we see?
Say it!

08:12.229 --> 08:14.090
Say the demon name.

08:15.704 --> 08:17.363
Save yourself.

08:17.883 --> 08:19.574
Use your power.

08:19.735 --> 08:21.475
You're going to have to kill me first.

08:21.562 --> 08:23.324
I don't believe
you mean that.

08:30.388 --> 08:31.854
Very well.

08:33.741 --> 08:36.225
Then you will watch
as your friends die

08:36.312 --> 08:38.066
one at a time

08:38.235 --> 08:41.129
until you prove
to the world what you really are.

08:51.315 --> 08:53.540
Say this name aloud

08:53.627 --> 08:55.850
and prove to us all

08:56.440 --> 08:59.741
that the Blackblood prophecy
is true.

09:09.244 --> 09:10.990
Nothing will happen.

09:16.534 --> 09:20.155
Whose neck shall I stretch
to get you to cooperate?

09:27.726 --> 09:28.825
This one?

09:33.522 --> 09:37.801
Handsome devil,
isn't he?

09:39.795 --> 09:43.812
Last chance.
Say the name.

09:43.899 --> 09:46.214
If I say the name, will you free them?

09:46.790 --> 09:48.941
I'll let you choose one.

09:50.845 --> 09:52.336
No.

09:57.103 --> 09:58.302
Very well.

09:59.666 --> 10:00.945
Kill him.

10:03.773 --> 10:06.136
- All right.
- Talon, no!

10:06.223 --> 10:08.333
He'll just kill us all
anyways.

10:11.841 --> 10:15.413
Baphnoro-Decayana-Glakku-

10:15.586 --> 10:18.706
Sikkundi-Alonaiya.

10:24.195 --> 10:26.948
- Where is it?
- I told you.

10:27.301 --> 10:29.167
Nothing will happen.

10:34.917 --> 10:37.441
Execute all of them at once.

10:40.968 --> 10:43.749
Gate Marshal Todry Higgs,

10:43.836 --> 10:47.442
acting magistrate of
the Gallwood Outpost,

10:47.529 --> 10:52.178
hereby make judgment upon
these traitors to the Realm."

10:52.265 --> 10:54.827
I should have exiled
that cretin years ago.

10:54.914 --> 10:56.239
I should have poisoned him.

10:56.326 --> 11:00.350
Janzo, you're coming up with
one of your smart ideas, right?

11:00.437 --> 11:01.943
I'm just wondering
whether we'll die

11:02.030 --> 11:04.143
by broken neck
or strangulation.

11:05.447 --> 11:07.247
I'd prefer broken neck, wouldn't you?

11:07.334 --> 11:08.776
Not helpful.

11:22.861 --> 11:25.770
"You are here and now condemned

11:25.916 --> 11:29.654
for sedition and treason,

11:29.812 --> 11:32.036
this, the 14th year of the

11:32.123 --> 11:35.120
dominion of the Prime Order.

11:35.332 --> 11:39.995
You are sentenced to
ignom... ignomi..."

11:40.082 --> 11:42.207
"Ignominious," you moron.

11:42.294 --> 11:43.932
Bollocks, you're stupid!

11:44.019 --> 11:45.458
You think I'm stupid, I...

11:45.545 --> 11:47.190
Get on with it!

11:52.770 --> 11:54.698
An army approaches!

11:55.163 --> 11:58.184
- What color?
- Yellow banners, Ambassador.

11:58.271 --> 12:01.377
Prepare for battle!

12:34.670 --> 12:37.818
Rescue the prisoners and
take back the Outpost.

12:43.285 --> 12:45.771
Finish them! Blackblood first!

12:52.305 --> 12:54.981
What are you doing?

12:55.220 --> 12:56.545
Raelius!

12:56.692 --> 12:58.736
Sorry to leave you hanging.

13:02.713 --> 13:04.415
Out of the way!

13:14.431 --> 13:17.002
Talon! Talon, Talon, let me help.

13:17.089 --> 13:18.144
No!

13:29.157 --> 13:30.790
Aah!

14:08.130 --> 14:09.498
Raelius!

14:14.069 --> 14:15.970
Behind you!

14:28.850 --> 14:31.027
Talon! Talon, where are you going?

14:54.109 --> 14:55.241
Aah!

15:37.419 --> 15:39.556
- Why won't you die?
- Force of habit.

15:39.643 --> 15:42.876
Your people are gone.
You have nothing left to live for.

15:43.045 --> 15:45.884
Made a promise to an old blacksmith
that I would fulfill a prophecy.

15:45.971 --> 15:48.531
A prophecy that predicts
untold death and destruction.

15:48.618 --> 15:49.677
This is what you want?

15:49.764 --> 15:52.246
If it's death and destruction
to the Prime Order, then yes!

16:02.661 --> 16:03.699
You're good.

16:03.786 --> 16:06.001
Good enough to beat
Magmoor and Shek...

16:06.146 --> 16:07.618
and now you.

16:29.704 --> 16:32.687
This blade belonged to my mother.

16:32.774 --> 16:37.325
She died protecting me from
the men you sent to murder us,

16:37.412 --> 16:40.539
and now her blade will avenge her death.

16:40.626 --> 16:43.392
Talon, no! Talon, don't!

16:46.886 --> 16:49.108
He killed my family, too.

16:49.465 --> 16:50.942
There are so many people that

16:51.029 --> 16:52.819
deserve to see him
brought to justice.

16:53.355 --> 16:55.320
Well, they can see his dead body.

16:55.407 --> 16:56.999
Talon, he will die.

16:57.365 --> 17:00.008
He will be sentenced to death,

17:00.394 --> 17:02.452
but not without a proper trial.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.513
I can't take that chance.

17:19.820 --> 17:22.031
And who do you think you are?

17:25.564 --> 17:27.878
I'll tell you who I am.

17:34.088 --> 17:36.683
I am your queen.

17:55.942 --> 17:58.305
I'm so sorry, Gwynn.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.891
He meant so much to me as well.

18:05.169 --> 18:07.461
We'll bury him tomorrow.

18:08.572 --> 18:10.977
Along with so many others.

18:12.576 --> 18:14.579
I should never have left.

18:15.279 --> 18:17.523
I should have been here with you.

18:18.716 --> 18:21.649
It wouldn't have ended
any better if you had been.

18:28.177 --> 18:30.063
Look at you.

18:31.426 --> 18:33.329
So brilliant.

18:35.083 --> 18:37.742
You should be
proud of your victory.

18:39.509 --> 18:41.114
Victory?

19:01.172 --> 19:04.616
Do you have anything to say for
yourself before I sentence you?

19:05.596 --> 19:08.769
I have nothing to say
to a pack of traitors.

19:10.253 --> 19:11.530
Tell me...

19:12.737 --> 19:14.946
does it make you feel like
more of a man

19:15.125 --> 19:17.456
to shed the blood of the innocent?

19:18.216 --> 19:20.386
Such as my father?

19:21.712 --> 19:23.456
Which father?

19:29.750 --> 19:32.589
You massacred Talon's people.

19:33.195 --> 19:36.139
You and the Prime
Order murdered my family

19:36.226 --> 19:39.628
along with every baron
and baroness in this Realm!

19:39.984 --> 19:42.190
And you call us the traitors?

19:42.421 --> 19:45.534
Governments rise and fall.

19:46.156 --> 19:49.108
Your right to rule is only imagined

19:49.195 --> 19:51.528
because your family conquered
the Realm

19:51.615 --> 19:54.292
from the conqueror
that came before them.

19:55.179 --> 19:58.386
My family ruled for
seven generations,

19:58.617 --> 20:03.058
in peace and justice by
the will of the people.

20:03.287 --> 20:06.042
You're a stupid, naive girl.

20:09.003 --> 20:10.929
Perhaps.

20:12.031 --> 20:16.300
But I'm the stupid, naive girl
that's sentencing you to death.

20:18.074 --> 20:22.378
To be carried out at sunrise
in accordance with royal law.

20:22.569 --> 20:24.714
Get him out of my sight.

20:39.109 --> 20:43.167
I don't have to tell you all
that we face difficult days ahead.

20:44.097 --> 20:47.651
I have appointed Captain
Spears as base commander.

20:49.096 --> 20:52.072
Today, we buried the dead,

20:52.304 --> 20:55.987
and tomorrow, we prepare for war.

20:57.760 --> 21:01.386
I thank you all for your bravery,

21:01.986 --> 21:04.144
and for your loyalty.

21:04.670 --> 21:06.355
You may go.

21:16.828 --> 21:18.612
Mr. Wythers?

21:20.258 --> 21:22.168
Stay a moment.

21:24.474 --> 21:26.347
You don't like me.

21:28.972 --> 21:31.200
Well, it's not my
place to have an opinion

21:31.287 --> 21:33.851
one way or the other,
tell you the truth.

21:34.023 --> 21:35.506
It's all right.

21:35.593 --> 21:37.644
I don't really like you, either.

21:38.046 --> 21:41.526
But, uh, your actions today saved us,

21:42.195 --> 21:44.423
and for that, I am grateful.

21:44.510 --> 21:46.370
Saved us for the moment.

21:47.624 --> 21:49.592
I'm sure between you
and the demon girl,

21:49.679 --> 21:52.199
it won't be the last time
our necks are on the line.

21:52.286 --> 21:54.284
Be that as it may...

21:57.918 --> 22:00.573
I wish to reinstate you
as Gate Marshal.

22:10.347 --> 22:12.790
I'm sorry for your loss,
by the way.

22:14.776 --> 22:16.444
He was a good man.

22:16.909 --> 22:18.725
Calkussar, I mean.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.483
Thank you.

22:22.554 --> 22:24.037
Are we done?

22:25.814 --> 22:29.506
Because I'm in a hurry to
visit an old comrade of mine...

22:30.055 --> 22:32.639
- Mr. Higgs.
- Mm.

22:33.204 --> 22:35.537
Do send him my regards.

22:49.356 --> 22:52.937
That's tax money
to pay the watchman.

22:53.696 --> 22:56.805
You wouldn't steal from
your own men now, would you?

22:56.934 --> 22:58.703
It's not your concern now.

22:58.887 --> 23:00.837
You're not the Gate Marshal anymore.

23:01.012 --> 23:03.008
Oh, but you see, uh,

23:03.634 --> 23:05.789
I've been reinstated.

23:19.016 --> 23:20.016
Aah!

23:33.476 --> 23:35.787
Look what you've gone and done.

23:37.089 --> 23:38.048
No!

23:38.135 --> 23:39.844
- Aah!
- Aah!

23:53.617 --> 23:55.260
Danno...

24:01.341 --> 24:04.185
you're a damn fine watchman,
boy.

24:19.308 --> 24:22.058
So you're telling me you know
how to manufacture colipsum?

24:22.145 --> 24:23.536
You're missing the point, Mother.

24:23.623 --> 24:26.467
People are dying because
of what we've done.

24:27.370 --> 24:29.686
That's why I've always
loved you the best.

24:29.792 --> 24:31.789
You always, always
come through for me.

24:31.876 --> 24:34.118
Finally, finally,
finally I'm gonna be rich.

24:34.205 --> 24:36.047
All right, what we have to do first

24:36.134 --> 24:38.072
is establish
a distribution network.

24:38.159 --> 24:39.953
We sell it right throughout the Realm

24:40.040 --> 24:41.944
and we cut
those Greyskins right out.

24:42.031 --> 24:43.900
That's precisely the problem,
Mother.

24:43.987 --> 24:47.046
Those Greyskins would happily
have us doing all the bidding

24:47.133 --> 24:49.498
and turn all of humankind
into Plaguelings.

24:49.585 --> 24:51.489
Oh, you silly boy.

24:51.576 --> 24:55.696
Listen to you with all
your theories of conspiracy.

24:55.783 --> 24:59.495
You know, the Greyskins,
they're in it like everybody else.

24:59.582 --> 25:02.642
- Just for the money.
- It's not a theory of conspiracy, Mother.

25:02.729 --> 25:05.376
It is a conspiracy.
We've already done way too much,

25:05.463 --> 25:07.515
- and we can't do anything else.
- Oh, listen to you.

25:07.602 --> 25:09.466
No, listen to you!

25:10.927 --> 25:15.001
You're so greedy you would
happily let innocent people die

25:15.088 --> 25:16.864
if it paid you enough gold.

25:17.956 --> 25:20.067
Janzo...

25:22.776 --> 25:25.193
everything has a price.

25:25.563 --> 25:26.759
Everything.

25:26.846 --> 25:30.051
And I won't let you do it anymore.

25:30.138 --> 25:31.392
You what?

25:32.248 --> 25:34.240
No, no, no, no.
Don't you do this.

25:34.327 --> 25:35.898
Don't you do this.

25:35.985 --> 25:38.912
I put a roof over your head.
I fed you when you were born.

25:38.999 --> 25:42.566
Colipsum is the only thing
you've ever done for me.

25:44.894 --> 25:48.330
If you think colipsum is the
only thing I've ever done for you,

25:48.417 --> 25:50.846
you're a worse person
than I thought.

25:51.167 --> 25:53.614
If you walk out of this room,
you'll be nothing to me, you know?

25:53.701 --> 25:57.511
You'll be nothing!
You'll just be a thing in my way.

26:06.164 --> 26:09.275
I'm going to burn the rest of this.

26:40.128 --> 26:41.708
I'll have what he's having.

26:47.838 --> 26:49.448
Cheers, mate.

26:52.439 --> 26:54.575
Look, I, um...

26:55.457 --> 26:57.206
thank you

26:57.574 --> 26:59.458
for what you did with Gwynn.

26:59.695 --> 27:02.239
Ah, it is what it is.

27:03.240 --> 27:05.997
I hate to admit it,
but you, uh,

27:06.215 --> 27:08.298
hitched yourself a good horse there.

27:08.385 --> 27:09.939
A horse?

27:10.330 --> 27:11.694
You mean the queen?

27:11.781 --> 27:13.239
Well, she is a brat.

27:13.326 --> 27:16.161
But she's a smart brat, and...

27:17.041 --> 27:19.192
she's beautiful, too.

27:19.632 --> 27:22.007
- You and her should really...
- No.

27:22.094 --> 27:23.876
No.

27:25.053 --> 27:29.210
No, I'm the, uh, I'm the son of
a hideous, irredeemable watchman.

27:29.297 --> 27:32.992
I... Someone like Gwynn,
she's far above my station.

27:33.079 --> 27:35.089
- Station?
- Mm.

27:35.212 --> 27:37.620
I've had so many women
above my station

27:37.707 --> 27:38.998
they had to make the station bigger.

27:39.085 --> 27:40.598
All right, all right.

27:41.118 --> 27:44.404
Although I will say I do
prefer women below my station.

27:44.902 --> 27:47.731
There is nobody
below your station.

28:02.858 --> 28:04.353
Yes?

28:06.356 --> 28:08.317
Hello, Janzo.

28:11.782 --> 28:13.302
What is it?

28:13.558 --> 28:18.160
"Only the Dragman can hear the
fire-song of the Vex Rezicon."

28:18.247 --> 28:19.911
Yes, we've already
discussed this.

28:20.017 --> 28:24.394
Fire-song?
Why is it called the "fire-song"?

28:25.793 --> 28:27.092
May I?

28:35.131 --> 28:37.406
Are you sure you want to do that?

29:01.280 --> 29:02.977
What is that?

29:03.275 --> 29:07.039
Voices, captured somehow
inside the crystal.

29:07.470 --> 29:10.379
Well, what good is that?
It's impossible to understand.

29:10.793 --> 29:13.633
"Only the Dragman can hear..."

29:14.419 --> 29:17.703
Oh!
Oh, Janzo.

29:18.499 --> 29:23.383
Only the Dragman can
understand the fire-song.

29:24.019 --> 29:26.573
Still no idea
what a Dragman is.

29:26.782 --> 29:30.656
Whatever it is,
we need it to translate the voices.

29:49.445 --> 29:51.570
Your word you'll free my family.

29:51.996 --> 29:53.609
You have my word.

29:59.824 --> 30:01.617
And our debt is paid up.

30:02.173 --> 30:03.629
In full.

30:27.742 --> 30:29.041
Come in.

30:32.986 --> 30:34.781
I was down at the Nightshade,

30:35.140 --> 30:37.046
saw the Octor table.

30:37.500 --> 30:41.414
Big game happening, but I just
felt like it was missing something.

30:42.325 --> 30:44.914
You know I can't play
Octor anymore, Garret.

30:45.230 --> 30:46.642
I'm a queen.

30:46.729 --> 30:47.899
I know.

30:48.165 --> 30:49.705
But you can come celebrate with me

30:49.792 --> 30:51.195
and the rest of your men.

30:51.301 --> 30:54.406
They deserve your
appreciation, Your Majesty.

30:58.899 --> 31:01.429
I think I'd rather
stay here alone.

31:02.474 --> 31:04.252
With you.

31:11.865 --> 31:15.343
Janzo tells me that kissing
you won't make me a Plagueling.

31:16.067 --> 31:18.843
I believe that's true, yes.

31:19.265 --> 31:23.165
Hmm. And, well,

31:23.640 --> 31:25.523
I'm queen now.

31:25.776 --> 31:27.176
So...

31:27.478 --> 31:30.953
I make the rules when
it comes to social propriety.

31:32.239 --> 31:34.206
Also true.

31:35.353 --> 31:38.851
So you, my only love,

31:39.272 --> 31:41.915
have no excuses left.

32:21.604 --> 32:23.772
We figured it out!

32:29.539 --> 32:32.539
I knocked, but I guess
with all the heavy breathing

32:32.626 --> 32:33.936
it's difficult to hear.

32:39.149 --> 32:41.031
Oh, Talon.

32:41.281 --> 32:44.425
She shouldn't have found out
that way.

32:55.428 --> 32:57.204
Did you find Gwynn and Garret?

32:57.304 --> 32:59.416
- What did they say?
- Nothing.

32:59.503 --> 33:02.180
Their mouths were too
busy doing something else.

33:03.700 --> 33:05.663
Oh, it's, um, Garret.

33:05.769 --> 33:07.186
He... he probably just had
quite a lot to drink,

33:07.273 --> 33:08.805
- didn't he?
- Well, he's an idiot.

33:08.892 --> 33:10.990
You're twice the man he is.

33:12.136 --> 33:13.993
Maybe... maybe in brains...

33:14.080 --> 33:17.044
actually, no.
Definitely in brains, but, um,

33:17.131 --> 33:19.671
but certainly not muscle mass.

33:23.096 --> 33:25.405
You always find a way
to make me laugh.

33:26.690 --> 33:27.956
Good.

33:29.293 --> 33:32.870
Just as long as you're
not laughing at me.

33:33.686 --> 33:35.632
Good man, Janzo.

33:37.753 --> 33:40.218
Do you really think so?

33:43.361 --> 33:45.624
You should have left the
Outpost when you had the chance.

33:45.711 --> 33:48.571
I don't leave loose ends.

33:48.967 --> 33:51.899
What makes you think you have
a better chance this time?

33:51.986 --> 33:53.567
Simple.

33:55.065 --> 33:57.413
- I don't fight fair.
- Let him go.

33:57.500 --> 34:00.469
Don't give up again,
Talon, because of me.

34:00.810 --> 34:02.575
Kill him.

34:04.661 --> 34:06.290
Let him go.

34:06.408 --> 34:08.774
You should know, I don't bluff.

34:15.547 --> 34:16.813
Now let him go!

34:16.900 --> 34:18.804
On your knees.

34:26.716 --> 34:29.391
Now slowly kick your blade away.

34:29.647 --> 34:34.536
Good. Lean forward and
expose your neck to my...

34:35.020 --> 34:38.114
Aah!

34:38.201 --> 34:40.101
No!

34:45.275 --> 34:46.668
I'm dying!

34:48.475 --> 34:49.940
Aah!

34:52.646 --> 34:54.489
Help, Talon.

35:05.516 --> 35:06.989
Tell me what to do.

35:07.076 --> 35:09.285
You need to stop the bleeding.

35:09.579 --> 35:12.449
Get the red hot poker and... and, um,

35:12.536 --> 35:14.526
and then cauterize my wounds.

35:14.613 --> 35:18.003
- You sure?
- It's my only chance.

35:19.925 --> 35:21.457
Aah!

35:29.163 --> 35:31.362
Can I give you anything for the pain?

35:31.450 --> 35:33.480
Do you have any colipsum?

35:39.500 --> 35:41.767
Aah!

35:43.531 --> 35:45.972
You all right?

35:48.095 --> 35:50.205
You all right?

35:51.152 --> 35:52.659
You did it.

35:54.881 --> 35:56.968
You did it, Talon.

35:57.265 --> 35:59.331
I'm gonna be all right.

35:59.718 --> 36:02.261
I promise you. I promise.

36:02.874 --> 36:04.352
Good.

36:06.388 --> 36:09.737
'Cause I can't believe it's taken
me this long to realize, but...

36:09.835 --> 36:11.092
Hmm?

36:11.234 --> 36:13.448
I mean, it took almost
losing you, but...

36:13.632 --> 36:17.081
I haven't cared about anyone
like this since Eramus.

36:20.195 --> 36:21.612
Do you really mean that?

36:21.699 --> 36:23.442
Because, Talon,

36:23.734 --> 36:27.878
I've been wanting to say
it for the longest time.

36:28.734 --> 36:32.023
I feel the same way about you, too.

36:34.863 --> 36:36.561
Wait.

36:36.995 --> 36:38.814
Who's Eramus?

36:39.451 --> 36:41.661
He's my brother.

36:49.364 --> 36:51.760
So what you're telling me is that, um,

36:51.866 --> 36:54.783
is that you love me like a brother?

36:55.591 --> 36:57.397
Yes.

36:57.942 --> 37:00.338
Did you ever kiss your
brother on the lips like that?

37:00.425 --> 37:02.186
No.

37:03.594 --> 37:05.256
No.

37:06.201 --> 37:08.799
I did that to distract
you from the pain.

37:10.092 --> 37:11.528
Ow!

37:11.615 --> 37:13.877
So much pain!

37:27.820 --> 37:29.525
How are you feeling?

37:30.450 --> 37:32.174
I feel better.

37:35.133 --> 37:37.697
Your burn is turning green.
Is that normal?

37:38.773 --> 37:40.877
I need you to go to the lab

37:41.336 --> 37:43.744
and get me some Charkoy powder.

37:44.296 --> 37:45.970
That should do the trick.

37:52.007 --> 37:53.447
You're late.

37:54.669 --> 37:56.646
Book is destroyed.

37:59.946 --> 38:02.252
- Well done.
- Where's my gold?

38:02.836 --> 38:05.387
I'll pay you when I'm safely
returned to the Prime Order.

38:05.474 --> 38:08.564
- That not our deal.
- I'll pay you double.

38:10.444 --> 38:12.978
Fly, you little bastard.

38:13.371 --> 38:19.551
Fly to your Greyskin masters
and get me some more colipsum.

38:29.301 --> 38:31.767
I so wish
my father was here.

38:33.815 --> 38:36.431
I don't know
if I can do this on my own.

38:37.608 --> 38:40.720
I no longer have anybody
I can trust for counsel.

38:46.105 --> 38:47.970
You have me, Miss.

38:48.452 --> 38:51.395
Remember Commander
Calkussar hand picked me,

38:51.643 --> 38:53.713
because you can trust me.

38:56.332 --> 38:58.275
Thank you, Naya.

39:04.780 --> 39:06.214
Talon?

39:06.301 --> 39:08.049
I've been looking everywhere for you.

39:08.153 --> 39:10.073
Dred's escaped his prison.

39:10.160 --> 39:11.280
I know.

39:11.387 --> 39:13.767
I was worried he'd come after you.

39:14.312 --> 39:16.305
He did.

39:16.690 --> 39:17.840
Did you kill him?

39:17.927 --> 39:19.490
No.

39:20.838 --> 39:23.197
He's probably long gone by now.

39:24.017 --> 39:25.514
I am sorry

39:25.608 --> 39:27.402
- that you had to see me...
- I get it.

39:27.564 --> 39:29.306
You belong to her.

39:29.412 --> 39:31.166
Are we done?

39:31.793 --> 39:35.103
I'm putting together a
team to go after Dred.

39:35.508 --> 39:37.830
I'm sure
you want to come with us.

39:40.362 --> 39:42.905
- When?
- Now.

39:47.573 --> 39:49.514
I hope you find him,

39:50.028 --> 39:52.291
but I have to look after Janzo.

40:46.879 --> 40:48.750
Show yourself.

41:05.961 --> 41:07.402
Who are you?

41:07.489 --> 41:11.223
Talon, she's just a child.

41:27.928 --> 41:30.005
Is this a Lu-Qiri name?

41:31.550 --> 41:33.460
Who are you?

41:34.178 --> 41:36.321
Who are you?

41:40.262 --> 41:42.588
I'm the Dragman.
