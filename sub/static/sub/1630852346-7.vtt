[tires squeal]

00:22.063 --> 00:24.899
[atmospheric music plays]

00:31.573 --> 00:33.783
It looks like some kind of calendar.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.577
Moray has drilled tunnels

00:35.660 --> 00:39.372
to somehow target important buildings
in rich areas of the city.

00:39.456 --> 00:42.667
Who knows how the ancient artifacts
factor into his plan,

00:42.751 --> 00:45.170
but this calendar might tell us
when he'll strike.

00:45.712 --> 00:48.423
Cool. So, can anyone read it?

00:48.506 --> 00:50.175
I wish Palindrome were here.

00:50.258 --> 00:52.177
-He'd know how.
-[Ms. Nowhere] Oh, yeah?

00:52.260 --> 00:57.348
Then why didn't your pal Pal include
a genius interpretation in his message?

00:57.432 --> 01:00.060
He probably didn't have
enough time to analyze it. [gasps]

01:00.143 --> 01:03.104
Moray must have captured him
after Palindrome sent the photo.

01:03.188 --> 01:07.442
-How do you know he was captured?
-If he wasn't captured, he'd be here.

01:07.525 --> 01:10.070
He promised we'd go out for ice cream
when he got back,

01:10.153 --> 01:12.322
and Palindrome doesn't break promises.

01:13.490 --> 01:16.701
It's okay to be jealous
of my new friendship, Ms. Nowhere.

01:17.118 --> 01:19.871
I'm not jealous!
I've got my own new best friend!

-[slurping]
-[smooching]

01:21.873 --> 01:24.375
-[all groan]
-Right on the mouth.

01:24.834 --> 01:28.379
Hey, guys. Shouldn't we get back
to the calendar, and stopping Moray?

01:28.463 --> 01:29.756
And saving Palindrome!

01:29.839 --> 01:32.634
I bet the curator can read the calendar.
Let's take it to him.

01:33.092 --> 01:36.095
This time, let's play it cool
and make sure the hauler's uncloaked.

01:36.179 --> 01:37.889
We're always scaring that guy.

01:56.741 --> 01:59.702
Sorry! We were really hoping
not to freak you out this time.

02:04.958 --> 02:09.045
Wow! This calendar appears to be
from the same pre-Aztec religion

02:09.129 --> 02:12.382
as the headdress,
jaguar tooth and obsidian ring!

02:12.465 --> 02:15.593
All other artifacts
were thought to be destroyed!

02:15.677 --> 02:17.637
Where on Earth did you find this?

02:17.720 --> 02:21.099
Our associate sent us that photo
from a tunnel system beneath the city.

02:21.182 --> 02:22.225
What does it say?

02:22.642 --> 02:25.145
It appears to be a doomsday calendar.

02:25.228 --> 02:26.980
Huh? Doomsday?

02:27.063 --> 02:31.484
It says that the world
is going to end in 12 seconds!

02:31.568 --> 02:32.610
[all exclaim]

02:32.694 --> 02:36.114
Oh, no, sorry.
That's a bean pod, not a cricket.

02:36.197 --> 02:38.032
The world ends in 12 hours.

02:38.116 --> 02:39.450
-[all gasp]
-Still not good!

02:39.868 --> 02:41.411
According to the calendar,

02:41.494 --> 02:44.330
the Ocelot King will appear
at the appointed hour

02:44.414 --> 02:46.666
to lead his fiery volcanic army,

02:46.749 --> 02:51.921
cleansing all of the evil from the Earth,
and leaving only his supporters.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.215
Man, I don't want a fiery cleansing!

02:54.299 --> 02:57.093
I bet Moray wants to make
that prophecy come true.

02:57.176 --> 03:01.681
Ah! This culture had
a superior knowledge of astrological time.

03:01.764 --> 03:06.519
[curator] There is likely complex
scientific reasoning behind the prophecy.

03:06.603 --> 03:09.355
Hm. There is an especially strong

03:09.439 --> 03:13.276
lunar and interplanetary
gravitational pull right now. Hm.

03:14.152 --> 03:15.570
-You see?
-Yes!

03:15.653 --> 03:17.155
[chuckles] Yeah, I see it too!

03:17.655 --> 03:21.034
But just to make sure we're on
the same page, could you say it out loud?

03:21.117 --> 03:23.119
[Frostee] Moray used
the calendar to work out

03:23.202 --> 03:25.788
when magma would be
nearest to the Earth's surface,

03:25.872 --> 03:27.498
due to the gravitational pulls.

03:27.582 --> 03:29.792
He's taking advantage of
the high level of magma

03:29.876 --> 03:32.086
to generate a big eruption in 12 hours.

03:32.503 --> 03:35.465
-He's making--
-[in unison] A giant volcano machine!

03:35.548 --> 03:37.759
-[sighs]
-We got to take him down.

03:37.842 --> 03:39.677
And save Palindrome!

03:40.053 --> 03:43.973
So we stop him from erupting the volcano
in whatever sciencey way he's planning to.

03:44.057 --> 03:47.393
Which one? There are volcanoes
all around Mexico City.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.604
Plus, the cops have
the hauler and our cars.

03:49.687 --> 03:51.314
I could fly one of my drones in

03:51.397 --> 03:53.900
to locate Palindrome and Moray's
volcano-exploding tech.

03:54.400 --> 03:57.362
Then what? We just stroll in on foot?

03:57.445 --> 03:59.280
I bet those tunnels go for miles.

03:59.364 --> 04:03.284
And what if one of your drones
"senses a rave" again?

04:03.368 --> 04:05.036
One false alarm...

04:05.119 --> 04:07.664
What about all the times
we did want a rave?

04:08.081 --> 04:09.791
We got to get our rides back.

04:09.874 --> 04:12.460
-[atmospheric music plays]
-[rumbling]

04:18.299 --> 04:21.678
[Palindrome] Why do you want to use
a volcano to blow up the entire city?

04:22.095 --> 04:23.930
You're better than that, Moray.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.766
I'm not going to blow up the entire city.

04:27.475 --> 04:30.019
My tunnels pinpoint specific buildings,

04:30.103 --> 04:33.439
so I don't hurt the impoverished
locations I wish to uplift.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.360
[rattling, whirring]

04:40.196 --> 04:43.324
Finally, the playing field
will be levelled,

04:43.408 --> 04:46.703
and the common people will take back
what is rightfully theirs.

04:47.537 --> 04:50.206
[Moray] The artifacts
are not just symbolic.

04:50.290 --> 04:54.002
Their jewels will power the eruption.

04:54.502 --> 04:58.214
Huh. That's the most cohesive statement
you've made since capturing me.

04:58.631 --> 05:03.803
Proof that these majestic items were
brought down to Earth by ancient aliens.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.889
Okay, back to crazy town.

05:07.682 --> 05:10.560
Sir, Ms. Nowhere and her team
escaped from the hauler.

05:11.269 --> 05:14.314
[groans] That woman never quits, does she?

05:14.772 --> 05:16.024
Not her style.

05:16.107 --> 05:18.359
Activate all our defense systems.

05:18.443 --> 05:21.821
If they set one foot in the tunnels,
take them out!

05:25.116 --> 05:26.659
[Frostee] Ah! Found our cars.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.077
They're still in the hauler,

05:28.161 --> 05:31.247
which is on lockdown in
a high-security facility downtown.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.541
Julius and I still have
our credentials intact.

05:33.624 --> 05:37.128
We can complete the forms to get the
hauler out through proper legal channels.

05:37.211 --> 05:39.881
That way, we don't risk
getting arrested or captured.

05:39.964 --> 05:43.676
Oh, please, Gary. You're just saying that
because you love doing paperwork.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.929
We got the hauler cab.
We could use it to bust into the facility.

05:47.013 --> 05:49.307
-My way is quicker.
-Is it?

05:49.390 --> 05:52.351
How about this: Gary and Julius
can go the paperwork route,

05:52.435 --> 05:54.896
while the rest of us
sneak into the facility.

05:54.979 --> 05:58.691
I like it! We'll see who finishes first.

05:58.775 --> 06:01.152
Oh, it's on!

06:01.235 --> 06:04.155
Guys, we're all working
toward the same goal.

06:04.238 --> 06:06.741
This is a compromise, not a competition.

06:06.824 --> 06:09.452
Because obviously
we're gonna destroy Gary and Julius!

06:09.535 --> 06:10.369
Here's the plan.

06:11.287 --> 06:12.830
[Tony] The Trojan Horse.

06:13.664 --> 06:16.292
We'll park the hauler cab
right in front of the facility,

06:16.375 --> 06:19.003
with Frostee in the secret compartment
in the wheel well.

06:19.087 --> 06:21.923
The feds will be all over it,
and tow it inside a secure lock.

06:22.006 --> 06:25.176
Then, Frostee can just attach the cab
to the hauler and drive it out.

06:26.844 --> 06:27.970
The trap's set.

06:28.763 --> 06:32.642
-It sure is cramped in here.
-[Tony] Don't worry. You'll be out soon.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.977
Just a sec...

06:38.064 --> 06:41.150
We'd like to fill out the necessary forms
to release a vehicle.

06:41.609 --> 06:42.944
Private or government?

06:43.402 --> 06:47.448
Neither, actually. It belongs to an agency
that doesn't officially exist.

06:50.326 --> 06:51.911
Also, it was impounded.

06:53.621 --> 06:55.123
Because it was housing fugitives.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.168
-Oh...
-[sighs]

06:59.252 --> 07:02.421
Julius, I have to admit: I'm nervous.

07:02.505 --> 07:05.049
What if my signature
freezes up under pressure?

07:05.133 --> 07:07.176
-[sighs]
-What would Palindrome say?

07:07.260 --> 07:11.472
That I have spent my entire life
training for this very moment.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.099
That's exactly right!

07:13.182 --> 07:16.644
The past is prelude
to the magnificent now!

07:16.727 --> 07:18.271
[stirring music plays]

07:18.771 --> 07:21.149

Ticket that!

07:55.433 --> 07:56.893
Whoa! [yells]

08:02.565 --> 08:03.399

Alright, Frostee.

08:43.564 --> 08:44.774
[Frostee] Aw, man...

08:44.857 --> 08:48.402
Ugh. They must have taken
the hauler apart to analyze it.

08:48.486 --> 08:50.154
Don't worry, I got this.

08:50.238 --> 08:52.698
I'm not just a tech guy,
I'm a man of action.

08:53.824 --> 08:55.493
[straining]

08:55.576 --> 08:57.954
Can your action be letting us in, bro?

08:58.037 --> 08:59.372
Ugh, that's heavy.

Yeah, I never really got that one.

09:16.806 --> 09:19.433
I'm getting concerned
Ms. Nowhere might pull ahead...

09:19.517 --> 09:22.311
Oh, how about we call the cops on them?

09:22.770 --> 09:27.275
No! I want to win this and
