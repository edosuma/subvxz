01:35.922 --> 01:39.524
<i>Hello, Internet, it's your friend Nicole
over here with an insane announcement.</i>

01:39.559 --> 01:42.361
<i>MacKenzie Bezos, 48 and looking
good, made headlines this week,</i>

01:42.394 --> 01:45.330
<i>when she announced that she
was joining The Giving Pledge,</i>

01:45.364 --> 01:49.736
<i>donating $15 billion, that's billion
with a "B," to 15 lucky winners.</i>

01:49.769 --> 01:51.470
- What?
- <i>If I had $15 billion dollars,</i>

01:51.503 --> 01:53.573
<i>I'd probably just make it
rain on millionaires.</i>

01:53.606 --> 01:54.641
<i>"I'm sorry you're so poor."</i>

01:54.674 --> 01:56.308
<i>Make millionaires</i>
<i>feel broke.</i>

01:56.341 --> 02:00.278
<i>All you have to do to enter is text
the numbers nine-eight-three-seven-six</i>

02:00.312 --> 02:01.881
<i>to the numbers below.</i>

02:01.914 --> 02:05.417
<i>So far, it's reported that 2.6 billion
people have already entered via text.</i>

02:05.450 --> 02:06.653
- Damn!
- <i>I'm one of them.</i>

02:06.686 --> 02:09.287
<i>I mean, I hope you win,</i>
<i>but I hope I win more.</i>

02:09.321 --> 02:12.558
<i>Good luck to everybody entering and
may the odds be ever in your favor.</i>

02:12.592 --> 02:14.426
<i>I think I've heard that
somewhere before.</i>

02:14.459 --> 02:16.729
<i>Whatever, I'll coin it.
It's mine now, it's mine now.</i>

02:16.763 --> 02:18.631
<i>Like the billion dollars.
Billion dollars!</i>

02:18.665 --> 02:20.600
<i>What would I even do
with a billion dollars?</i>

02:20.633 --> 02:22.869
<i>I'd buy all the pools</i>
<i>and all the pool boys.</i>

02:25.772 --> 02:29.542
You know, I bet they created one
of those deceptive algorithm codes

02:29.575 --> 02:33.746
that prevents Black text messages
from winning that billion dollars.

02:33.780 --> 02:37.984
Stop, baby, be quiet.
I have five more minutes to sleep.

02:38.017 --> 02:39.652
Shut up.

02:39.686 --> 02:41.486
Get up and clean up.

02:42.922 --> 02:45.892
You know, God just needs
to send me a new girlfriend,

02:45.925 --> 02:48.761
maybe like one or two,
or three or four.

02:48.795 --> 02:52.799
Maybe a Puerto Rican, a Haitian,
and four Africans.

02:52.832 --> 02:55.868
Yeah, you know,
maybe one from Somalia,

02:55.902 --> 02:58.871
Ethiopia and then
four Nigerians...

03:01.040 --> 03:02.441
and a white girl.

03:02.474 --> 03:03.676
Oh!

03:24.530 --> 03:25.698
Fuck my life.

03:36.809 --> 03:38.376
<i>Like a billion dollars.</i>

03:38.410 --> 03:40.345
<i>What would I even
do with a billion dollars?</i>

03:43.415 --> 03:44.416
What?

03:46.351 --> 03:48.921
What are you doing?

03:48.955 --> 03:50.990
Why are you just sitting
out here on your phone?

03:52.658 --> 03:54.861
Nora, I'm thinking.

03:54.894 --> 03:56.328
Oh, you're thinking.

03:57.496 --> 03:58.965
All right, well,
thank you, Jesus.

03:58.998 --> 04:00.833
You're answering my prayers.
Thank you.

04:00.867 --> 04:02.068
- Excuse me.
- Oh.

04:02.101 --> 04:03.502
Nora...

04:04.804 --> 04:06.471
we really need
some serious money

04:06.505 --> 04:07.673
coming through this house.

04:07.707 --> 04:10.375
Oh, we really need some serious
money in this house, huh?

04:10.408 --> 04:13.813
- Yes.
- Well, why don't you at least try to match my pay grade?

04:13.846 --> 04:16.716
I'm not talking about a couple of
thousand dollars a month, Nora.

04:17.683 --> 04:18.885
Oh, don't you sound all bad

04:18.918 --> 04:20.418
like you about to go rob a bank?

04:20.452 --> 04:21.687
Hmm.

04:21.721 --> 04:24.757
Look, I know you freak out when
you're faced with hard work.

04:24.791 --> 04:25.958
You're quite the motivator.

04:27.392 --> 04:29.529
You're late for work.
It's 9:30, Kareem.

04:29.562 --> 04:31.329
You're supposed
to be at work at 8:00.

04:31.363 --> 04:32.698
Like, why are you
complaining, though,

04:32.732 --> 04:33.966
and you don't
go to work on time?

04:34.000 --> 04:35.201
And as a matter of fact,

04:35.234 --> 04:37.570
you never, ever, ever, ever,
ever, ever go to work on time.

04:37.603 --> 04:39.972
Nora, the only people who are
up at 8:00 in the morning

04:40.006 --> 04:42.507
purchasing furniture
are old-ass senior citizens

04:42.542 --> 04:44.544
purchasing those cheap-ass
$99 rocking chairs.

04:44.577 --> 04:46.746
And you know I don't make
no real money off that.

04:46.779 --> 04:49.347
So I ain't going
to work on time.

04:49.849 --> 04:50.917
Hmm.

04:52.885 --> 04:56.022
You know, you can be
very, very negative at times?

04:56.055 --> 04:57.924
Well, I have a savings account.

04:57.957 --> 04:59.357
Yeah.

04:59.391 --> 05:02.762
So? Ain't nothing in it but like
three-four dollars and some change.

05:02.795 --> 05:04.429
Whatever.

05:04.462 --> 05:06.566
How much
you got in there for real?

05:06.599 --> 05:09.735
Negative $15.
But I needed some eyelashes.

05:09.769 --> 05:11.070
Yeah.

05:11.103 --> 05:12.538
Well, see you later.

05:13.639 --> 05:15.875
- Bye. Bye, boy.
- All righty.

05:15.908 --> 05:18.578
- Go to work, you're late.
- Yeah, yeah.

05:21.714 --> 05:22.782
Nice ass.

05:28.453 --> 05:29.989
Here's his write-up, sir.

05:30.022 --> 05:31.824
Why are you always
writing me up?

05:31.858 --> 05:35.460
Why are you always late?
Why are you late again?

05:35.493 --> 05:36.963
Because he told on me, again.

05:36.996 --> 05:39.866
No, it's because
you're irresponsible.

05:39.899 --> 05:42.400
See how lame
your lead nerd manager is

05:42.434 --> 05:44.070
spewing out
all these racial stereotypes.

05:45.503 --> 05:46.906
Here's his monthly report, sir.

05:46.939 --> 05:48.541
Thank you, uh, Peter.

05:48.574 --> 05:51.110
Oh, heavens to Murgatroyd,
you're late again?

05:51.143 --> 05:53.511
I mean, 42 times?

05:53.546 --> 05:54.680
- Kareem!
- Forty-two times?

05:54.714 --> 05:55.948
Okay... How is that
even possible?

05:55.982 --> 05:57.884
There are not even
that many days in the month.

05:57.917 --> 05:59.619
Clearly, he's making
this up, Darryl.

05:59.652 --> 06:00.853
Darryl?

06:00.887 --> 06:03.089
You call him Mr. Johnson,
Kareem.

06:03.122 --> 06:04.690
Thank you, thank you, Peter.

06:04.724 --> 06:05.758
Thank you.

06:06.458 --> 06:07.793
My brother.

06:07.827 --> 06:10.129
Brother, is there any way you and
I can discuss this as brothers

06:10.162 --> 06:11.898
without the white man
in our business?

06:11.931 --> 06:14.934
No, no. Can you...
Can you explain why you're always late?

06:14.967 --> 06:16.002
Can you do that?

06:16.035 --> 06:17.870
That's a very racist question
for you to ask me,

06:17.904 --> 06:19.171
but since you want
to know so bad,

06:19.205 --> 06:22.008
Nora don't be waking me up in time.
But the real reason...

06:22.041 --> 06:23.843
- What?
- ...is because of AIR.

06:23.876 --> 06:24.911
- Air?
- Air.

06:24.944 --> 06:26.178
What are you talking about?

06:26.212 --> 06:28.881
American institutional racism.

06:28.915 --> 06:31.851
Here we go, playing the race card.

06:31.884 --> 06:33.586
The news said this would happen.

06:33.619 --> 06:35.855
What, your white clock
doesn't wake you up on time?

06:35.888 --> 06:38.891
Exactly. You see, that's why
I don't enjoy coming here,

06:38.925 --> 06:41.961
because of all the bigotry and
prejudices that I have to endure.

06:41.994 --> 06:45.064
Every time I show up, it's like I'm
forced to go to the back of the bus.

06:45.097 --> 06:46.766
That is absurd.

06:46.799 --> 06:49.602
This is an
African American-owned company.

06:49.635 --> 06:52.238
He's your brother,
and I don't mean like "brotha."

06:52.271 --> 06:54.807
I mean,
he's literally your brother.

06:54.840 --> 06:57.944
You guys have the same mother
and the same fa...

06:57.977 --> 07:00.646
fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa...

07:00.680 --> 07:02.848
Y'all mama, too,
got the same baby daddy, right?

07:02.882 --> 07:05.785
I present institutional racism
in the flesh.

07:05.818 --> 07:07.519
You know what,
I'm sick of your BS.

07:07.553 --> 07:09.521
Okay, I can smell it
way over here.

07:09.555 --> 07:12.992
All right? This is your last chance,
Kareem. There's nothing to say, okay?

07:13.025 --> 07:15.628
And yes, Peter,
we have the same father.

07:15.661 --> 07:18.731
Which makes me wonder,
what, what happened to you?

07:18.764 --> 07:20.833
This is your last chance,
I swear.

07:20.866 --> 07:24.003
Bring your Black ass in here
late one more time, you're fired.

07:24.737 --> 07:26.205
Are we clear?

07:26.238 --> 07:27.974
Please get out of my office.

07:28.007 --> 07:29.976
You know, you keep
howling at me like that,

07:30.009 --> 07:31.277
you're gonna raise
your cholesterol.

07:31.310 --> 07:33.245
What, I... Don't worry
about my cholesterol.

07:33.279 --> 07:35.181
Worry about Nora
waking you up on time.

07:35.214 --> 07:37.550
Offices usually have doors
to exit out of, but...

07:37.583 --> 07:38.818
- Get out of here.
- It's your office.

07:38.851 --> 07:41.220
Thank you, Peter. I'm document...
Put that on the report.

07:41.253 --> 07:43.289
- Can you believe, accusations...
- Put extra words...

07:43.322 --> 07:45.791
- Put extra words on there.
- Accusations of racism.

07:45.825 --> 07:48.027
I voted for Obama.

07:52.999 --> 07:54.266
Johnson Furniture Store.

07:54.300 --> 07:56.235
Hey, y'all carry cell phones?

07:57.570 --> 07:58.938
Do we carry cell phones?

07:58.971 --> 08:00.873
Who did you just call?

08:00.906 --> 08:02.641
Um, is this
Johnson's Furniture Store?

08:02.675 --> 08:06.846
What type of goofy-ass person calls a furniture
store and asks if they carry cell phones?

08:06.879 --> 08:08.180
Excuse me?

08:08.214 --> 08:10.016
Excuse me.
What type of goof-ass person

08:10.049 --> 08:12.952
calls a furniture store and
asks if they carry cell phones?

08:12.985 --> 08:16.322
Uh-uh, hold on, wait a minute.
Let me get your manager.

08:16.355 --> 08:18.691
And I need your name
and your badge number.

08:20.092 --> 08:21.961
Hello,
my name is Peter,

08:21.994 --> 08:24.096
and I'm the only white guy
who works here.

08:24.130 --> 08:26.065
I'm a skinny, goofy,
crooked-toothed, lame-ass white boy.

08:26.098 --> 08:27.566
Is there anything else
you'd like to know?

08:27.600 --> 08:29.168
You know what? Uh-uh.

08:29.201 --> 08:34.040
I gonna have my boyfriend Tyrone come down
there and beat your ass, Peter Parker.

08:34.073 --> 08:36.909
Tyrone?
I'm sure he just got out of the joint.

08:36.942 --> 08:39.178
Well, listen,
you tell Tyrone that Peter...

08:39.211 --> 08:42.348
Again, that's Peter, said that,
"I will beat his black ass

08:42.381 --> 08:44.650
<i>"from here all the way
back to Attica or Africa,</i>

08:44.683 --> 08:46.552
"and I'll be here
waiting on him. Shalom."

08:47.620 --> 08:48.821
Sha...

08:48.854 --> 08:50.122
Shalom, my ass.

09:04.737 --> 09:05.771
Tyrone.

09:12.778 --> 09:13.946
Kareem.

09:15.181 --> 09:17.083
Check it out real quick, Peter.

09:17.116 --> 09:18.751
Ay.

09:18.784 --> 09:19.852
Truce?

09:19.885 --> 09:21.187
What do you want, Kareem?

09:21.220 --> 09:22.221
So...

09:23.956 --> 09:27.927
A guy named Tyrone is gonna be
coming through a little later

09:27.960 --> 09:30.296
to pick up a dining room,
bathroom and kitchen set.

09:30.329 --> 09:31.964
But I'm gonna be
on my lunch break.

09:31.997 --> 09:33.766
You mind knocking
that out for me?

09:33.799 --> 09:35.201
Sure, yeah.

09:35.234 --> 09:37.036
Thanks, man.

09:37.069 --> 09:38.938
I do have a question
for you, though.

09:41.073 --> 09:43.709
How does one go about making...

09:43.742 --> 09:45.244
white people money?

09:45.277 --> 09:47.146
What kind of half-witted
question is that?

09:47.179 --> 09:48.214
You white, right?

09:48.247 --> 09:49.782
No, I'm Puerto Rican.

09:49.815 --> 09:51.984
Okay, Petey Pablo,

09:52.017 --> 09:54.253
how does one go about
making white people money?

09:54.286 --> 09:56.288
Okay, I'll play your game.

09:56.322 --> 09:57.923
What is white people money?

09:57.957 --> 10:01.794
Affluence, wealth, prosperity.

10:01.827 --> 10:05.297
See, white people money
means no problems.

10:05.331 --> 10:06.533
Get-out-of-jail-free card.

10:06.566 --> 10:08.701
You get pulled over by the cops,
you get to say things like,

10:08.734 --> 10:10.736
"Why the hell did you pull me
over, you son of a bitch?

10:10.769 --> 10:13.973
"Now, why don't you go take a
honeybun, stick it up your noodle nose

10:14.006 --> 10:16.442
"and watch it come out through
your ears," and drive off alive.

10:16.475 --> 10:18.744
I need white people money.

10:18.777 --> 10:20.679
That... That has nothing
to do with money.

10:20.713 --> 10:21.881
That's white privilege.

10:21.914 --> 10:23.349
Black people
have privilege, too.

10:23.382 --> 10:25.050
Shit, like what?

10:25.084 --> 10:28.454
Well, like, you get to call
white people racist names,

10:28.487 --> 10:30.289
and you get to say the N-word.

10:30.322 --> 10:32.725
I will no longer entertain
this ignorance.

10:33.826 --> 10:35.794
What you doing?

10:35.828 --> 10:37.663
If you do find
white people money,

10:38.931 --> 10:39.999
please let me know.

10:47.273 --> 10:49.875
You were two minutes late
coming back from work yesterday.

10:51.277 --> 10:53.479
And...

10:53.512 --> 10:56.849
you know, you say
some of the most racist things

10:56.882 --> 10:59.418
I've ever heard
in my entire life.

10:59.451 --> 11:03.722
It's African Americans like you
that make Obama look bad.

11:03.756 --> 11:06.725
Excuse me, sonny,
where can I find the rocking chairs?

11:13.899 --> 11:15.234
Hello.

11:15.267 --> 11:17.336
I mean...

11:17.369 --> 11:19.738
Johnson Furniture Company.

11:19.772 --> 11:21.440
Where's Peter Parker?

11:27.880 --> 11:30.849
Hello. I'm calling you.
Your food is gonna get cold.

11:31.517 --> 11:33.018
Kareem Malik Johnson!

11:33.052 --> 11:34.486
Girl, what is wrong with you?

11:34.520 --> 11:37.356
- What is you hollering your breath in my ear for?
- What are you doing?

11:39.925 --> 11:41.760
Nora, sit.

11:43.062 --> 11:45.231
- You don't tell me what to do.
- Sit down.

11:51.370 --> 11:54.240
Something has been itching
at me all week long.

11:54.273 --> 11:56.208
Well, that's because
when you take a shower,

11:56.242 --> 11:59.311
you're supposed to use a towel and soap, so.

11:59.345 --> 12:01.113
Sorry, baby,
you walked into that one.

12:01.146 --> 12:03.415
- I'm serious. Now hear me out.
- Okay.

12:04.817 --> 12:07.486
The secret
to solving our problems

12:07.519 --> 12:10.322
is that we need
white people money.

12:10.356 --> 12:12.891
Look, now I'm starting to see
why your momma and daddy,

12:12.925 --> 12:15.528
changed the locks on you when you
moved out. 'Cause you're delusional.

12:15.562 --> 12:18.130
Nora, we need
white people money.

12:18.163 --> 12:21.000
Now, just... Just hear me out.

12:21.033 --> 12:23.168
All right, I'm listening,
Negro Buffet.

12:25.104 --> 12:27.906
So, you're not happy,
I'm not happy.

12:27.940 --> 12:30.109
No, I'm happy, you're not happy.

12:30.142 --> 12:32.444
You ate a whole gallon
of Cap'n Crunch ice cream

12:32.478 --> 12:36.415
the other day while watching
the whole rerun of <i>Girlfriends.</i>

12:36.448 --> 12:37.550
That's because I'm happy.

12:38.417 --> 12:40.319
Now, let's hear
what you have to say.

12:41.453 --> 12:44.123
Could you, like,
just stop being mean for two seconds,

12:44.156 --> 12:46.158
I'm trying to tell you
this is going to work.

12:46.191 --> 12:47.826
Yes, I will,
when one of your ideas

12:47.860 --> 12:49.461
actually pan out
and are successful.

12:50.029 --> 12:51.163
Now, let's hear this plan

12:51.196 --> 12:54.066
about how you're gonna get
all this white people money,

12:54.099 --> 12:57.036
Mr. Money Is The Key
To Happiness.

12:57.069 --> 13:00.540
And you know what? I always
prayed for a man like James Evans.

13:00.573 --> 13:03.242
You know, he lived in the
projects and he was still happy.

13:03.275 --> 13:05.844
James Evans was miserable.

13:05.878 --> 13:08.213
All he did was scream
and howl at those kids.

13:08.247 --> 13:10.382
Now, Cliff Huxtable was happy.

13:10.416 --> 13:12.351
So the Cosbys
had white people money?

13:12.384 --> 13:14.286
Laxative mouth! Listen.

13:16.388 --> 13:19.158
Do you know
who MacKenzie Bezos is?

13:20.426 --> 13:23.228
Sounds pretty familiar, but no.

13:23.262 --> 13:26.098
That's exactly why you don't
have any white people money.

13:26.131 --> 13:28.100
Well, apparently,
you two have become BFFs,

13:28.133 --> 13:30.235
and you don't even have
black people money.

13:30.269 --> 13:32.071
Hmm.

13:32.104 --> 13:34.106
Do you know who Jeff Bezos is?

13:34.139 --> 13:36.241
Are you really asking me
if I'm cheating on you?

13:36.275 --> 13:37.476
I don't know no Jeffs.

13:39.579 --> 13:41.347
You don't know
who Jeff Bezos is?

13:41.380 --> 13:42.549
I said no.

13:42.582 --> 13:44.983
God damn, you dumb.

13:45.451 --> 13:46.452
Your mama.

13:46.485 --> 13:48.621
It's gonna be impossible
to get white people money

13:48.655 --> 13:51.056
- with a woman like you backing me up.
- Backing you up?

13:51.090 --> 13:52.257
Hold up.

13:52.291 --> 13:54.159
This <i>Grand Theft Auto</i>
playing Negro

13:54.193 --> 13:56.195
- just say, "backing him up"?
- <i>That's a knockout.</i>

13:56.228 --> 13:58.130
First of all,
I don't back nobody up

13:58.163 --> 13:59.965
who I have to split bills with.

13:59.998 --> 14:02.034
Do you know who Cardi B is?

14:02.067 --> 14:03.536
Ah, of course
I know who Cardi B is.

14:03.570 --> 14:05.304
I mean, who don't know
who Cardi B is?

14:05.337 --> 14:08.941
My God, I knew I should've left your ass in
the projects when they was demolishing 'em.

14:10.175 --> 14:13.379
Jeff Bezos is the founder
of Amazon.

14:13.412 --> 14:15.648
He's worth over $100 billion.

14:15.682 --> 14:18.651
Well, why didn't you
just say that?

14:18.685 --> 14:20.919
I want to hear more about it,
but if I find out

14:20.953 --> 14:22.521
that you had that man
for ransom money,

14:22.555 --> 14:24.256
I'm gonna tell your mama
on that one.

14:24.289 --> 14:27.126
Jeff and MacKenzie
are now divorced.

14:27.159 --> 14:29.194
Oh, so she probably
got half, huh?

14:29.228 --> 14:32.231
- Right, exactly, so...
- Cha-ching.

14:33.298 --> 14:34.433
- As of now...
- Mm-hmm.

14:34.466 --> 14:36.636
...she's giving away
$15 billion.

14:38.170 --> 14:41.073
Just asking people
to text a particular number

14:41.106 --> 14:45.545
and she's going to give away
$15 billion to each winner.

14:45.578 --> 14:48.548
Okay, Black people
always wishing for luck.

14:48.581 --> 14:51.216
Like, that doesn't
make no sense.

14:51.250 --> 14:54.019
So, I was thinking I should send
a text message to that number

14:54.052 --> 14:56.021
before you came
and rudely interrupted me

14:56.054 --> 14:57.456
with all of that
negative energy.

14:58.223 --> 15:00.159
So, why haven't you?

15:00.192 --> 15:02.662
Because I wanted to check it out
to make sure it was legit,

15:02.695 --> 15:04.531
and, baby I did,
and I'm telling you,

15:04.564 --> 15:06.999
it is the real deal.

15:08.066 --> 15:09.669
And of course I... I didn't...

15:09.702 --> 15:12.037
want to risk anybody
hacking into my bank account

15:12.070 --> 15:14.473
to try to rip me off or anything
like that, you know.

15:14.506 --> 15:16.975
Trust me, if a scammer looked
into your bank account,

15:17.009 --> 15:19.478
they would definitely
set up a GoFundMe page for you.

15:19.511 --> 15:24.516
I mean, do you actually think this woman
is gonna give away $15 billion to 15 people

15:24.551 --> 15:26.418
and all you have to do
is send out a text?

15:26.452 --> 15:29.154
- Yes.
- Are you serious?

15:29.188 --> 15:31.490
- Yes.
- Why are you so gullible?

15:31.523 --> 15:35.093
Oh, my God. You are the most gullible
guy I have ever dated in my entire life.

15:35.127 --> 15:38.096
You are not like James Evans.
You are not like Carl Winslow.

15:38.130 --> 15:42.067
You are not like Cliff Huxtable, and you
are definitely not like Philip Banks.

15:42.100 --> 15:43.502
You know who you're like?

15:43.536 --> 15:47.206
You're like, um,
Ben Stiller in <i>The Waterboy.</i>

15:47.239 --> 15:48.440
That's who you're like.

15:50.710 --> 15:53.512
- That was Adam Sandler.
- Same white boys.

15:59.686 --> 16:02.454
So life gonna keep
whaling on me, right?

16:02.488 --> 16:04.289
Having me always broke.

16:06.793 --> 16:08.393
Think we might...

16:14.601 --> 16:17.436
Oh, my God. Baby, it's 5:00 a.m.
What are you doing?

16:18.070 --> 16:22.107
Baby, this is me focusing.

16:22.140 --> 16:25.979
This is me willing
into existence

16:26.713 --> 16:27.814
my billion dollars.

16:27.847 --> 16:29.749
That's why
I need some...

16:29.782 --> 16:32.619
Get me my money.

16:32.652 --> 16:34.453
Don't matter how long it takes.

16:34.486 --> 16:37.155
- I'm gonna beat up all day.
- Okay, but, did you send the text?

16:37.189 --> 16:39.124
- Did you send it?
- Did I send it?

16:40.527 --> 16:43.161
Can you help me take
this off please? Thank you.

16:43.195 --> 16:44.564
But you sent the text, right?

16:44.597 --> 16:49.167
Baby, I sent that text
over a week ago,

16:49.201 --> 16:50.670
and I must tell you...

16:53.305 --> 16:55.708
All of this waiting has aged me
for at least 20 years.

16:55.742 --> 16:58.545
You see, that's why
I'm just trying to... Hmm.

16:58.578 --> 17:00.412
- Okay, calm down, baby.
- Hmm, hmm.

17:00.445 --> 17:01.614
Baby, calm down.

17:01.648 --> 17:03.282
It's okay, just breathe.

17:04.283 --> 17:06.385
I'm here for you.

17:06.418 --> 17:08.220
Everything's gonna be okay.

17:08.253 --> 17:09.321
Right.

17:09.354 --> 17:10.790
We just gotta...

17:10.823 --> 17:13.492
refocus your mind,
you know, and just,

17:13.525 --> 17:15.762
start thinking thoughts like,

17:15.795 --> 17:19.264
if you did win
this billion dollars,

17:19.298 --> 17:21.734
what would you do with it?

17:21.768 --> 17:25.070
- If I did win a billion dollars... If I did.
- Right? Yeah.

17:25.672 --> 17:26.773
That's a good question.

17:29.141 --> 17:32.679
Hmm, what would I do?

17:32.712 --> 17:35.715
Let's make this quick.
So, as we agreed, here's 300K.

17:35.748 --> 17:38.450
She works downtown
at the Diamond Shoe Store.

17:38.483 --> 17:40.853
She usually takes
her lunch break around 2:00.

17:40.887 --> 17:42.789
But I know for a fact
she gets off at 9:00.

17:42.822 --> 17:47.292
Just make that shit clean,
all right? Y'all be smooth.

17:47.326 --> 17:50.429
Oh, baby, I will buy you the biggest
house that money could possibly buy.

17:50.462 --> 17:52.397
- Are you serious?
- I'm so serious.

17:52.431 --> 17:53.800
Oh, baby.

17:53.833 --> 17:55.868
- Hey? Yes.
- What?

17:55.902 --> 17:57.202
Baby...

17:58.303 --> 17:59.572
What would you do?

17:59.606 --> 18:01.574
- What would I do?
- Yeah?

18:01.608 --> 18:04.544
Um, I don't know.

18:15.722 --> 18:19.291
Uh, you and I,
we would sail all over the world.

18:19.324 --> 18:23.362
You know?
Ooh, making love all day,

18:23.395 --> 18:26.566
eating fresh fruits and vegetables
and fish right out the ocean.

18:26.599 --> 18:28.735
We would be living
our best life.

18:28.768 --> 18:30.903
No. Like, seriously,
what would you really do?

18:30.937 --> 18:32.672
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

18:32.705 --> 18:33.906
Okay, you go first.

18:34.841 --> 18:37.242
Shit, I'd probably
have your ass whacked.

18:37.275 --> 18:39.746
Yeah, I'd be on a island
with a Idris Elba-type.

18:39.779 --> 18:41.581
Mm. Yeah, I figured that.

18:41.614 --> 18:43.616
But, baby, if we had
white people money,

18:43.650 --> 18:45.283
it would be amazing!

18:45.317 --> 18:47.720
- See, baby, you're seeing my vision, baby.
- Yes, I do.

18:47.754 --> 18:49.956
- Right?
- I really, really do. I do.

18:49.989 --> 18:54.259
Yes, and I just have
to focus my mind, you know.

18:54.292 --> 18:56.194
Just positive thinking. Just...

18:56.228 --> 18:57.930
Positive. Yeah, right.

18:57.964 --> 19:00.700
Like, we take all of the negative energy, right,

19:00.733 --> 19:02.535
we put it here in our hands,
ball it up.

19:02.568 --> 19:03.970
Help me ball it up,
help me ball it up,

19:04.003 --> 19:06.706
- and we take it and we put it right in the open. Boom.
- There it is.

19:06.739 --> 19:08.675
- Now, the house is filled with positivity, right?
- Okay.

19:08.708 --> 19:10.308
- I feel it.
- I feel it.

19:10.342 --> 19:11.611
- Ooh.
- I feel it.

19:11.644 --> 19:14.379
- Oh, I love you, boy.
- I love you, too, baby.

19:14.413 --> 19:17.516
All this positive thinking

19:17.550 --> 19:19.652
has me wanting
to make love right now.

19:19.686 --> 19:21.520
Oh, yeah? Right now, right now?

19:21.554 --> 19:22.521
All sweaty.

19:22.555 --> 19:25.591
So, let's go upstairs
so I can ha, ha, ha, ha.

19:25.625 --> 19:27.627
Come here,
I'll give it to you right now.

19:27.660 --> 19:32.230
Now, yes, give it to me.
Oh, yes, yes, yes. So good, um...

19:32.264 --> 19:34.600
Ooh. No, no, no, no...

19:34.634 --> 19:36.602
No, no, no, I got you,
I got you, I got you.

19:36.636 --> 19:38.403
- Baby. Oh, man.
- Aw...

19:39.539 --> 19:41.506
This is
Kareem Malik Johnson.

19:47.914 --> 19:49.615
Y'all not playing
with me, right?

19:49.649 --> 19:51.349
Who is it?

19:51.383 --> 19:52.451
Who is it?

19:52.484 --> 19:55.387
Okay, so, um,
what do I have to do?

19:58.624 --> 20:00.525
Oh, shi... Okay.
I'm on my way right now.

20:00.560 --> 20:02.260
I was just about
to give my girl that thing.

20:02.294 --> 20:04.864
Thank you. Okay, so, listen,
y'all not going nowhere, right?

20:04.897 --> 20:07.365
I'm on my way right now.
Y'all are not going nowhere?

20:07.399 --> 20:10.502
Okay, wait, I don't wanna
be on nobody's news.

20:10.536 --> 20:12.872
Any way y'all could cash out me
the billion dollars?

20:12.905 --> 20:14.006
Oh, my God!

20:15.307 --> 20:17.442
No. Okay, uh, QuickPay.

20:18.711 --> 20:20.113
Shh...

20:20.146 --> 20:22.882
Any way you can send somebody over
with the paperwork to my apartment?

20:22.915 --> 20:24.349
Sending somebody?

20:25.084 --> 20:27.720
Ah, thank you...

20:27.754 --> 20:29.989
- What, what what... what did they say?
- Whoo! Baby...

20:30.022 --> 20:32.692
- Yes? Yes? Yes?
- We are billionaires!

20:34.927 --> 20:36.461
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God!

20:36.495 --> 20:37.697
- We're rich, we're rich.
- We're rich.

20:37.730 --> 20:38.731
- Okay, don't lie to me, don't lie to me.
- I ain't lying.

20:38.765 --> 20:41.067
- Don't lie to me.
- I ain't lying. I ain't lying.

20:41.100 --> 20:43.368
Okay, look me in my eyes,
tell me that we are...

20:43.401 --> 20:46.438
Baby, we are billionaires!

20:46.471 --> 20:48.574
Oh, my mama! Oh, my mama!

20:48.608 --> 20:50.308
Baby, I love you, oh, my God!

20:56.015 --> 20:57.650
- Hey, hey, hey...
- What? What?

20:57.683 --> 21:00.385
Billionaire, billionaire,
billionaire, billionaire, go!

21:01.821 --> 21:04.023
- Oh, we gotta do this. Hell no, we gotta do this.
- Give it to me.

21:04.056 --> 21:05.825
- Give it to me right now.
- Come on, right now.

21:05.858 --> 21:07.292
- From the side, from the side.
- Get it!

21:07.325 --> 21:10.495
From the side. Hell yeah. All right,
just give me a second. You ready?

21:10.530 --> 21:12.765
- Oh, my God, we're doing it. Ah!
- Yes!

21:13.699 --> 21:15.333
Oh...

21:15.367 --> 21:16.836
Do you know what time it is?

21:16.869 --> 21:18.336
I don't know.

21:18.370 --> 21:20.873
- Been out here for at least 30 minutes.
- Oh.

21:20.907 --> 21:22.642
Do you think
they really gonna come?

21:22.675 --> 21:25.678
Look, all I know is I can't wait
to tell my mama and daddy.

21:25.711 --> 21:28.346
And when I get to work today,
I'm 'bout to fire myself

21:28.380 --> 21:30.783
because these jobs,
they work us too hard anyway, right?

21:30.817 --> 21:33.786
Eh... You see? That's why
I asked them to come here.

21:33.820 --> 21:35.888
No one can ever know
about this money.

21:36.789 --> 21:37.857
Why?

21:39.491 --> 21:41.527
Because Black people be begging.

21:41.561 --> 21:43.863
The moment we let the cat out
the bag that we're billionaires,

21:43.896 --> 21:45.598
you're gonna have
blocks and blocks of people

21:45.631 --> 21:46.999
lined up with their hands out
like cups.

21:47.033 --> 21:48.734
I can already
hear my mama right now

21:48.768 --> 21:50.502
begging me to buy her
pastor that new Bentley,

21:50.536 --> 21:54.140
and your daddy begging me to buy him them
false-ass teeth he been praying to Jesus for.

21:54.173 --> 21:56.508
Okay, so, you not gonna
get your mama nothing?

21:56.542 --> 21:58.077
I mean, shit, I'm gonna
get her a little something,

21:58.110 --> 21:59.679
but you know my momma
ain't like me in years,

21:59.712 --> 22:01.647
ever since I stole
that weed out her purse.

22:01.681 --> 22:03.415
Okay, well, I'm buying
my mama and daddy

22:03.448 --> 22:04.917
and getting them out the hood
with my half.

22:05.751 --> 22:06.786
Yes, I am.

22:06.819 --> 22:08.154
Wait, your half?

22:08.187 --> 22:09.989
Yeah, baby, we fifty-fifty.

22:10.022 --> 22:11.090
Okay, listen.

22:12.592 --> 22:14.961
We're gonna
keep this place as our decoy.

22:14.994 --> 22:18.164
But we are gonna buy
a mansion that no one,

22:18.197 --> 22:20.166
and I do mean no one
can know about.

22:20.199 --> 22:22.869
Not our mamas, daddies, cousins,

22:22.902 --> 22:24.804
uncles, aunties, friends,

22:24.837 --> 22:26.639
co-workers, enemies,
etcetera, etcetera.

22:26.672 --> 22:28.708
As far as they know,
this is where we live.

22:29.542 --> 22:32.410
Baby, we're billionaires,

22:32.444 --> 22:35.615
and it is important for us to hide
that from the rest of the world

22:35.648 --> 22:37.984
or we will be broke.
Do you understand?

22:39.919 --> 22:41.087
No.

22:41.120 --> 22:44.090
What is the point of being a
billionaire if nobody knows?

22:44.123 --> 22:45.591
Oh, Jesus Christ. Okay...

22:47.960 --> 22:49.528
To keep our money.

22:50.696 --> 22:52.031
Look at me.

22:52.064 --> 22:53.065
Baby, look at me.

22:53.966 --> 22:55.835
Do you trust me?

22:55.868 --> 22:58.938
I mean, since I willed us a
billion dollars, do you trust me?

23:00.139 --> 23:02.507
Yeah, I guess. I do.

23:04.777 --> 23:07.146
All right, so,
when do we move into this mansion,

23:07.179 --> 23:09.115
and how often can we stay there?

23:09.148 --> 23:10.616
Everyday.

23:10.650 --> 23:12.184
Baby, this place is our decoy.

23:12.218 --> 23:14.720
When people come to visit us,
they come here.

23:14.754 --> 23:18.423
No one can ever know
about this money.

23:19.759 --> 23:21.794
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay? Right.

23:21.827 --> 23:23.129
- I get it.
- All right.

23:23.162 --> 23:24.230
- No one.
- All right.

23:24.263 --> 23:25.831
Where the fuck is this man at?

23:25.865 --> 23:27.733
Man...

23:27.767 --> 23:30.569
Oh, my Gosh,
Just out here waiting.

23:30.603 --> 23:32.204
Exactly.
That's what I'm saying.

23:32.238 --> 23:34.674
Wait. Is that them? Right there.

23:34.707 --> 23:35.808
Oh, shit, baby, it is.

23:35.841 --> 23:37.810
- Yeah, he pulling up, he pulling up.
- Oh, my God!

23:37.843 --> 23:39.812
- Cool, baby, calm down.
- How's my hair? How's my hair?

23:39.845 --> 23:41.747
- Fantastic, okay?
- Okay.

23:41.781 --> 23:43.983
- He's coming. Should we smile?
- Oh, yeah, smile.

23:44.016 --> 23:46.218
- Smile, cheese? Okay, come on, let's cheese.
- Mm-hmm.

23:46.252 --> 23:48.220
- Wave. Should we wave? Atta wave.
- Wave.

23:48.254 --> 23:50.455
- Act natural
- Natural.

23:53.759 --> 23:54.794
- Guys.
- Hey!

23:54.827 --> 23:56.595
Hey. Nora, Kareem, I take it?

23:56.629 --> 23:58.064
- Yes, yes.
- Hi.

23:58.097 --> 24:00.498
Hi, I'm Brandon. Brandon Amos.

24:00.533 --> 24:03.970
- How're you doing, Brandon?
- Not to be confused with Famous Amos.

24:04.003 --> 24:05.237
Oh.

24:05.271 --> 24:07.505
I loved those cookies.
Boy, when they were black-owned...

24:07.540 --> 24:08.841
- Anyway...
- Indeed.

24:08.874 --> 24:11.210
Uh, I'm here to get your paperwork
and get you guys paid out.

24:11.243 --> 24:12.510
- All right.
- Yeah, and, um...

24:12.545 --> 24:14.046
Yeah, take care
of that business,

24:14.080 --> 24:15.781
and then you guys will be rich!

24:15.815 --> 24:16.882
- Ooh.
- Yeah.

24:16.916 --> 24:19.218
- Yes.
- So let me hold the envelope on this side

24:19.251 --> 24:21.020
and you can hand it
right over to me.

24:21.053 --> 24:23.089
- Whatever. I don't...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah you can just...

24:23.122 --> 24:24.890
You know, who knows
who runs the household?

24:24.924 --> 24:26.258
You know what,
this is what I'd do.

24:26.292 --> 24:29.128
I'd just snatch that right out your hand.
How about right there?

24:29.161 --> 24:30.830
Okay, let me just...

24:30.863 --> 24:32.531
stare at it in the sun one time.

24:32.565 --> 24:33.766
Oh, yeah. That's a beautiful...

24:33.799 --> 24:36.302
It's all there. I assure you.

24:36.335 --> 24:38.571
In fact, can I get a selfie?
You guys mind?

24:39.638 --> 24:41.674
Uh, yeah, that should be fine.

24:41.707 --> 24:44.610
We just don't want to end up,
on, like, the media and the news,

24:44.643 --> 24:48.014
like Fox, CNN, ABC,
and all that funny business.

24:48.047 --> 24:49.081
Yeah, I get it.

24:49.115 --> 24:51.951
I get it, 'cause you know,
Black people be begging.

24:51.984 --> 24:53.886
See?

24:53.919 --> 24:56.789
All right, I do want to tell you,
though, that the Black dollar

24:56.822 --> 24:59.759
only circulates, like,
six hours in a community. So I...

24:59.792 --> 25:03.796
I fully expect you two Negroes to be
right back on the unemployment line soon.

25:03.829 --> 25:06.699
Come on, let's get this photo.

25:06.732 --> 25:07.867
All right.

25:20.646 --> 25:22.782
Where we going?
To the mansion.

25:22.815 --> 25:24.884
Hey, guess what? I want you...

25:24.917 --> 25:26.352
Ey! Ey! Do I look...

25:29.655 --> 25:31.757
Oh, I'm so excited
we bought this house.

25:31.791 --> 25:33.225
- Look at us, baby.
- Thank you, baby.

25:37.696 --> 25:38.998
Baby, this is...

25:44.737 --> 25:45.838
Baby?

25:47.173 --> 25:48.841
No.

26:04.690 --> 26:07.059
Now, why did I have to learn

26:07.093 --> 26:09.261
that you guys are billionaires

26:09.295 --> 26:10.262
via social media?

26:10.296 --> 26:14.867
I only need $500 million.
It's for the store.

26:14.900 --> 26:15.935
Don't worry.

26:15.968 --> 26:18.270
I have made you a partner.

26:18.304 --> 26:19.338
Congratulations.

26:19.371 --> 26:20.372
Let's hear it, everyone.

26:20.406 --> 26:23.776
You know, Pastor is expecting
that new Bentley.

26:23.809 --> 26:24.844
I just want an island.

26:26.212 --> 26:28.414
Now I can get the teeth
I prayed to Jesus for.

26:30.883 --> 26:32.685
I just want a pair of LeBrons.

26:32.718 --> 26:34.019
Come on, come on, let's go.

26:34.053 --> 26:35.421
Driver, come on, push it.

26:35.454 --> 26:37.690
Come on, push it. Push it.

26:37.723 --> 26:39.859
Load it, bro, come on, fly.

26:46.165 --> 26:47.766
Go upstairs right now.

26:47.800 --> 26:49.935
And clean from under the bed so we can
hide under there, okay? Do that right now.

26:49.969 --> 26:51.904
I just don't believe he posted
our winnings on social media.

26:51.937 --> 26:53.172
- That's crazy.
- Man, shit. I know.

26:53.205 --> 26:55.207
I'm gonna need some of that
bread to get his ass whacked.

26:55.241 --> 26:57.243
- I just hope they ain't following.
- Right?

26:59.211 --> 27:01.213
Ooh, yes, yes, look, yes!
Let me see that.

27:01.247 --> 27:02.748
- What? What?
- Let me see that. Let me see.

27:02.781 --> 27:05.151
That's all I need.
Now they really can't get in.

27:05.184 --> 27:06.519
Fool, that is my water bottle.

27:06.553 --> 27:09.421
Like, it doesn't have enough weight
to stop them from getting in.

27:10.222 --> 27:11.690
They don't know that.

27:12.691 --> 27:14.727
- That's not gonna do nothing.
- But you...

27:14.760 --> 27:16.262
- Look...
- What?

27:19.064 --> 27:20.332
What?

27:20.366 --> 27:22.034
- So...
- Yes?

27:22.067 --> 27:24.036
We damn near need
to leave the country.

27:24.069 --> 27:25.704
Ooh, that's a good thing.

27:25.738 --> 27:27.973
Like, somewhere like Paris,
you know.

27:28.007 --> 27:30.009
Like... Ooh, <i>oui, oui, bonjour.</i>

27:30.042 --> 27:31.076
- You know?
- No.

27:31.110 --> 27:33.746
You can go to Paris.
I'm taking my ass to Africa.

27:33.779 --> 27:36.315
Why everybody always want to skip over Africa?

27:41.420 --> 27:42.421
Baby...

27:44.890 --> 27:47.326
The hairs on my arm
are standing up and you know...

27:47.359 --> 27:49.261
when the hairs on my arm
come to attention,

27:49.295 --> 27:50.930
that means danger is lurking.

27:53.999 --> 27:56.168
- Baby.
- Yeah, baby?

27:56.202 --> 27:59.004
Why does it feel like there
are two robbers wearing masks

27:59.038 --> 28:00.439
literally lurking behind us?

28:03.375 --> 28:04.476
Because they are, baby.

28:08.914 --> 28:10.316
Oh, God!

28:10.349 --> 28:11.784
Oh, fuck, they all got niggas
teleporting through the atmosphere.

28:11.817 --> 28:12.952
How the fuck
did y'all get in here?

28:12.985 --> 28:16.155
I am warning you, I know
triple, double, black belt,

28:16.188 --> 28:17.890
backward kick with a side
of shrimp fried rice.

28:17.923 --> 28:18.958
- She will...
- Don't play with me.

28:18.991 --> 28:20.826
Good. We have guns
and we'll shoot you,

28:20.859 --> 28:23.495
and the bullets will turn
you both into egg fu young.

28:23.530 --> 28:26.098
Shit, they ain't playing, baby.

28:26.131 --> 28:30.502
Peter, I've got to get my hands on
at least $500 million of that money.

28:30.537 --> 28:32.037
I have to keep
the lights on in here,

28:32.071 --> 28:33.772
or literally,
my wife will lynch me.

28:33.806 --> 28:36.141
Do not tell anyone that.
That is between you and I.

28:36.175 --> 28:38.244
Oh, all right, well,
how are we supposed to do that?

28:38.277 --> 28:39.845
That is why I pay you, Peter,

28:39.878 --> 28:41.880
to tap into the white excellence
of your mind.

28:41.914 --> 28:43.015
You are my triple C,

28:43.048 --> 28:45.117
my Caucasian cataclysmic climax.

28:45.150 --> 28:47.786
I need your ideas, Peter.

28:48.487 --> 28:50.155
Wait a minute.

28:52.157 --> 28:53.627
I have it.

28:53.660 --> 28:57.062
We are gonna make them a soul food
meal and take it to their apartment.

28:58.163 --> 28:59.465
Better yet.

28:59.498 --> 29:02.268
We'll invite them over because
I'm not gonna subject my wife

29:02.301 --> 29:03.737
to the cockroaches
those Blacks have.

29:03.769 --> 29:07.039
As aa matter of fact, have them
decon before they come in the house

29:07.072 --> 29:08.941
because they may have
some in their shoes.

29:08.974 --> 29:10.577
Then, I am gonna
have my wife prepare

29:10.610 --> 29:15.080
the most amazing soul food meal
in the history of soul food meals

29:15.114 --> 29:17.550
no Black person
would ever be able to resist.

29:17.584 --> 29:20.252
I am talking
about fried chicken.

29:20.286 --> 29:22.087
Mm, delicious.

29:22.121 --> 29:24.390
Corn bread and collard greens.

29:24.423 --> 29:25.924
Jesus take the wheel.

29:25.958 --> 29:27.960
Black-eyed peas.

29:27.993 --> 29:29.495
Oh, I'm bringing
the hot sauce, baby.

29:29.529 --> 29:32.064
Yams, cabbage,

29:32.097 --> 29:34.833
chitterlings that make you
shake, baby,

29:34.867 --> 29:36.603
shake, baby, your butt stink!

29:36.636 --> 29:38.504
- This is brilliant, Darryl.
- Yes!

29:38.538 --> 29:41.541
You're a genius. I see what you're
doing, and this is freaking genius.

29:41.574 --> 29:43.976
Oh, Peter,
when you see brilliance,

29:44.009 --> 29:47.479
you recognize it and you're like
"Calgon, take me away!"

29:47.513 --> 29:49.114
You see
where I'm going with this.

29:49.148 --> 29:50.949
Oh, I see where
you're going with this.

29:50.983 --> 29:53.285
You're going to assassinate
both of them

29:53.319 --> 29:55.321
by giving them a heart attack.

29:55.354 --> 29:56.690
It's brilliant.

29:56.723 --> 30:00.225
Nothing kills Black people more
than soul food and the police.

30:00.259 --> 30:01.594
What?

30:01.628 --> 30:05.431
Nothing kills Black people more
than soul food and the police?

30:05.464 --> 30:08.367
No. Peter, walk with me.

30:10.035 --> 30:13.238
Sorry, but you are planning
an insurance scam, right?

30:13.272 --> 30:15.908
No insurance scams, Peter.
You want to get written up?

30:15.941 --> 30:18.210
- No, I don't...
- Close it. Right?

30:18.243 --> 30:19.478
That all I need you to do.

30:19.511 --> 30:22.047
I... I am the brilliant one.

30:22.081 --> 30:23.916
I. Thank you.

30:23.949 --> 30:26.553
Walk with me to excellence. Ha!

30:27.353 --> 30:28.320
Peter, Peter.

30:28.354 --> 30:30.222
Peter Piper picked a peck
of pickled peppers.

30:30.255 --> 30:32.524
Now, if Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers,

30:32.559 --> 30:34.360
where's the peck
that Peter Piper picked?

30:35.260 --> 30:36.161
Never mind, Peter.

30:36.195 --> 30:37.564
What I'm trying to get you
to understand

30:37.597 --> 30:42.034
is that Black people do not kill
one another for insurance money.

30:42.067 --> 30:46.271
Well, all I'm saying is my auntie
has been married, like, six times

30:46.305 --> 30:49.341
and she's knocked off each one of
her husbands for the insurance money,

30:49.375 --> 30:54.581
and no one has questioned her
about a thing.

30:54.614 --> 30:56.616
- Are you serious, Peter?
- What's your plan?

30:59.184 --> 31:04.390
I am gonna kill them
with sweet, sincere kindness.

31:04.423 --> 31:10.329
I'm gonna have my wife
prepare the soul food meal.

31:11.230 --> 31:12.431
Like ASAP, huh.

31:12.464 --> 31:16.502
Yes, yes, the things we do as entrepreneurs.

31:17.970 --> 31:21.073
Hello, my queen.
Yes, darling. My Snow White.

31:21.106 --> 31:22.842
I need a favor.

31:22.876 --> 31:28.715
I need for you to prepare the absolute best
soul food meal you have prepared in your life,

31:28.748 --> 31:31.016
and I need it done by 5:00.

31:31.049 --> 31:34.953
Well, let's just say
we're having guests.

31:36.054 --> 31:37.590
Yes. No, sweetie, come on.

31:37.624 --> 31:39.391
I'm highly allergic
to cockroaches.

31:39.425 --> 31:41.493
There's no way I'm gonna
put you through that,

31:41.528 --> 31:45.565
have them Blacks bring
those freaking roaches over, no.

31:45.598 --> 31:47.299
Come on. Come on.

31:47.332 --> 31:49.134
Yes, do me a favor.

31:49.168 --> 31:51.203
Have the seven dwarves help you.

31:51.236 --> 31:53.238
All right?
Yes, yes, yes.

31:53.272 --> 31:54.707
Wear your daishiki.

31:54.741 --> 31:56.576
Best one you got, okay?

31:56.609 --> 31:58.277
If you need
I can bring you another.

31:58.310 --> 32:01.146
Look good. Okay, love you.
Okay, bye.

32:04.049 --> 32:05.451
I just want some red bones.

32:06.653 --> 32:08.454
Neck bones, Peter.

32:08.487 --> 32:09.521
- Neck bones.
- Neck bones.

32:09.556 --> 32:10.590
- Those, yep.
- Okay, get it right.

32:10.623 --> 32:12.024
Get it right. Come on.

32:12.057 --> 32:13.425
- I have a question.
- Please.

32:14.526 --> 32:17.029
- What are chitlins?
- Chitterlings.

32:17.062 --> 32:18.230
Chitterlings.
Chitterlings.

32:18.263 --> 32:20.399
Chitter, chitter, chitterlings.

32:20.432 --> 32:22.167
And Black people
say "chitlins" sometimes.

32:22.201 --> 32:24.102
But really, it's pronunciated

32:24.136 --> 32:26.673
and... and... and spelled
chit... chitter... chitterlings.

32:26.706 --> 32:28.173
Chitterlings.

32:28.207 --> 32:30.743
No. Just forget it, Peter.

32:30.777 --> 32:33.445
Just... Oh, my God.

32:35.280 --> 32:37.650
- Baby...
- Yeah, baby?

32:37.684 --> 32:39.418
They're gonna kill us.

32:39.451 --> 32:42.254
Because they're
showing us their faces?

32:48.060 --> 32:50.128
Oh, no.

32:50.162 --> 32:51.731
Listen, okay, we gotta pray.

32:51.764 --> 32:53.666
- We just need to pray.
- Pray?

32:53.700 --> 32:56.068
- Let's pray, let's pray.
- Let's pray.

32:56.101 --> 32:58.504
<i>Shabaka, Shabaka, Shabaka.</i>

32:58.538 --> 33:00.640
Oh, God! Jesus.

33:00.673 --> 33:02.441
I have been such
a good Christian.

33:02.474 --> 33:05.511
- Yes, Lord.
- Please don't make me die like this.

33:05.545 --> 33:08.113
You know what?
Just take Kareem,

33:08.146 --> 33:11.316
'cause I never see him talk
to you anyway, you know.

33:12.317 --> 33:14.554
- In the name of Yeshua...
- What?

33:14.587 --> 33:16.221
Amen.

33:16.255 --> 33:18.825
<i>Yeshua, Yeshua,
Shabaka, Shabaka.</i>

33:18.858 --> 33:21.093
Put your hands up.

33:22.127 --> 33:24.831
We took off our masks
because we want our faces

33:24.864 --> 33:27.499
to be shown
on this TV show, too.

33:27.534 --> 33:30.168
- This ain't all about y'all.
- (MOUTHS) Hi, Mom!

33:30.202 --> 33:31.236
- My mama...
- You!

33:31.270 --> 33:34.306
Okay, obviously, you guys
are not fucking around,

33:34.339 --> 33:39.679
so my mama be here in an hour to
pick up some squares and some bread.

33:39.712 --> 33:42.147
And she told me I couldn't have
any company, so...

33:43.883 --> 33:45.718
I'm gonna need y'all to leave,

33:45.752 --> 33:47.085
so y'all don't get me
in trouble.

33:47.119 --> 33:48.120
Sit!

33:49.556 --> 33:51.223
Come on, man, you gonna
get me in trouble, bro.

33:51.256 --> 33:53.191
She be whooping me
with extension cords...

33:53.225 --> 33:56.395
Shut your mouth
before I put a bullet in it.

34:01.133 --> 34:03.235
I'm calling DCFS
on both of them.

34:03.268 --> 34:05.137
Yeah, can I make a suggestion?

34:05.170 --> 34:06.739
- What?
- Yeah.

34:06.773 --> 34:08.741
Just... just a suggestion.
Here...

34:08.775 --> 34:10.877
You know, 'cause I wanna show
them...

34:10.910 --> 34:13.780
I used to dibble and dabble
a little acting, you know,

34:13.813 --> 34:16.616
and, um, when you say that line,

34:16.649 --> 34:18.785
"Shut up
before I put a bullet in it"?

34:18.818 --> 34:19.786
Yeah, that one right there.

34:19.819 --> 34:22.889
I would put some more
Blaxploitation on it.

34:22.922 --> 34:24.557
- What the fuck?
- A little more twang.

34:24.591 --> 34:26.224
Okay, let me show you.
Let me show you.

34:26.258 --> 34:27.526
- Give me the gun.
- Okay.

34:27.560 --> 34:29.328
Uh, no, are you crazy?

34:29.361 --> 34:31.229
I'm gonna give it back.

34:31.263 --> 34:32.865
Give it to me...

34:41.841 --> 34:44.176
- Okay...
- Stop! Stop pointing the gun at me.

34:44.209 --> 34:46.679
- Baby, it is acting.
- It's a real gun.

34:46.713 --> 34:48.681
- Oh, my gosh, don't be so...
- Stop! Come on!

34:50.650 --> 34:53.886
Okay, now let me
demonstrate that line.

34:53.920 --> 34:57.489
Shut up, uh,
before I put a bullet in it,

34:57.522 --> 34:59.424
you jive turkey.

35:00.325 --> 35:01.861
Give me back my damn gun.

35:02.461 --> 35:04.396
Ooh!

35:04.429 --> 35:07.600
Okay. Be careful. I am delicate,
and there are no stunt doubles over here.

35:07.634 --> 35:09.869
How come you ain't
just hand me the gun?

35:09.902 --> 35:12.504
Well, because I told her
I was gonna give it back to her.

35:12.538 --> 35:14.841
I mean, what, you trying to sit
here and make me out to be a liar

35:14.874 --> 35:16.809
after we just prayed together?

35:16.843 --> 35:18.845
You know,
you going to hell, Kareem.

35:21.748 --> 35:24.550
So what do y'all want from us?

35:25.217 --> 35:26.586
What do we want?

35:26.619 --> 35:28.755
- We want white people money.
- Right.

35:28.788 --> 35:29.889
And you won it.

35:30.556 --> 35:32.759
Now, don't I look real scary?

35:34.560 --> 35:35.928
- Yeah, you look really scary.
- You look like...

35:35.962 --> 35:37.697
You look like you live
with your mama.

35:37.730 --> 35:39.431
...you work
at a gas station, actually.

35:39.464 --> 35:41.668
I do still live with my mumma.

35:41.701 --> 35:44.169
But if I had white people money,
I wouldn't.

35:46.773 --> 35:48.574
Now, we're not greedy.

35:48.608 --> 35:51.611
We know y'all have
a little under a billion

35:51.644 --> 35:54.513
because y'all... Y'all
had to move everyone out the hood.

35:54.547 --> 35:56.949
So we just want ten million
to split between us.

35:56.983 --> 35:58.483
Mm-hmm.

35:58.517 --> 36:04.289
This man just went from sounding like
Saddam Hussein to fucking Tom Brady.

36:04.322 --> 36:05.658
I'm confused.

36:05.692 --> 36:09.996
Are you from Benghazi
or Deerfield, Illinois?

36:10.029 --> 36:12.665
And what are y'all gonna do
with $10 million?

36:12.699 --> 36:14.000
To split.

36:14.033 --> 36:16.234
I'm gonna use it
to move back to my country.

36:16.836 --> 36:18.236
Back to your country?

36:20.272 --> 36:21.741
Which is what?

36:21.774 --> 36:23.241
Afghanistan.

36:23.275 --> 36:24.509
"Afghanistan."

36:24.544 --> 36:26.679
US done messed them
over so much, bro.

36:26.713 --> 36:31.416
You could probably get the whole country
for about $9.99 at a discount price.

36:31.450 --> 36:32.685
Exactly.

36:32.719 --> 36:35.320
But don't I look real scary?

36:35.353 --> 36:37.924
Okay, why do you guys
keep asking if you look scary?

36:37.957 --> 36:41.393
- Yeah.
- I mean, yes, okay, you have guns.

36:41.426 --> 36:42.494
We're not used to that.

36:42.528 --> 36:44.597
So, yes, you both look
very scary with those guns.

36:44.630 --> 36:46.498
He keeps asking
doesn't he look scary

36:46.532 --> 36:48.801
because he put a lot
of dark eyeliner on his eyes

36:48.835 --> 36:52.538
to look like how Hollywood
portrays "terrorists"

36:52.572 --> 36:53.740
in all their movies.

36:56.576 --> 36:58.544
So don't I look scary?

36:58.578 --> 37:00.713
You look like you work
at a gas station,

37:00.747 --> 37:02.915
- and you might as well just shoot Nora right now.
- What?

37:02.949 --> 37:04.917
'Cause I'm not giving up
$10 million.

37:04.951 --> 37:07.452
"A gas station"?
You're stereotyping me?

37:07.486 --> 37:09.555
I should shoot the black
off your face.

37:09.589 --> 37:12.424
Don't shoot him yet, Jermaine.

37:13.391 --> 37:15.393
Wait, hold on.

37:15.427 --> 37:17.462
Hold on
one cotton-picking minute.

37:17.496 --> 37:18.497
What is your name?

37:20.398 --> 37:22.001
- Jermaine...
- Right?

37:22.034 --> 37:24.937
Oh, like Jermaine Jackson?

37:24.971 --> 37:26.973
Jermaine Jefferson.

37:28.507 --> 37:29.942
Leave me alone.

37:29.976 --> 37:33.345
Now, who makes the money
decisions around this beast?

37:33.378 --> 37:38.350
Is it Uncle Ben or Aunt Jemimah
without the do-rag?

37:38.383 --> 37:40.553
- Oh.
- Hey, man, that's some racist-ass shit.

37:40.586 --> 37:43.055
- That's for the gas station joke.
- That was racist.

37:43.089 --> 37:47.760
Now, what do we have to do to get our
fair share of this white people money.

37:47.794 --> 37:49.128
Do I have to shoot you
in your leg

37:49.162 --> 37:52.698
or do I have to kill your baby
mama to show you I'm not playing.

37:53.800 --> 37:56.536
Okay, look,
you terrorist-looking,

37:56.569 --> 38:01.541
uh, Hollywood man
with a black name, whatever.

38:01.574 --> 38:02.942
Okay.

38:02.975 --> 38:04.376
The money is in my account,

38:04.409 --> 38:06.411
so that line
should be directed to me.

38:06.444 --> 38:07.445
Hmm.

38:09.081 --> 38:11.083
Do I need to shoot you
in one of your legs

38:11.117 --> 38:14.754
or do I kill your baby daddy
to show you I'm not playing?

38:14.787 --> 38:15.822
Yo, man, come on...

38:15.855 --> 38:18.356
Well, we do have
a billion dollars,

38:18.390 --> 38:21.928
so if you killed him,
I'll give you, like, $20 million.

38:21.961 --> 38:25.430
Baby, shoot him right now.
Shoot them now.

38:25.463 --> 38:27.133
- Shoot him!
- What?

38:27.166 --> 38:28.601
Sorry, baby.

38:32.772 --> 38:35.074
Whee-hee.

38:35.107 --> 38:38.611
Mm, I smell
soul food cooking already.

38:42.148 --> 38:44.116
One for you and one for me.

38:44.150 --> 38:46.819
Thank you, baby.
Another one?

38:46.853 --> 38:49.755
So I have this dope idea
for an investment.

38:52.892 --> 38:54.560
You're an American.

38:54.594 --> 38:55.962
What's with the fake accent?

38:55.995 --> 38:58.463
You know how Hollywood
be doing us Middle Easterners.

38:58.496 --> 39:01.801
Something about Muhammad-Ali-Ali-Baba-
Yusuf-Ali-Yusuf accent.

39:01.834 --> 39:03.703
You know, to appear more scary.

39:03.736 --> 39:04.971
Oh.

39:05.004 --> 39:07.573
So, are those real bullets
in the gun or...

39:07.607 --> 39:08.875
Yeah.

39:08.908 --> 39:10.676
- We're still gonna rob you.
- Hello.

39:10.710 --> 39:12.912
- We just want our white people money.
- Mm-hmm.

39:12.945 --> 39:15.915
We're just taking a break
to play a game of Spades.

39:15.948 --> 39:17.884
Draw four.

39:17.917 --> 39:19.819
- Draw four?
- Draw four in a game of Spades?

39:19.852 --> 39:22.154
- Never done that before, but... Okay.
- Okay.

39:22.188 --> 39:24.090
I'm sorry. This is, like,
really, really bothering me.

39:24.123 --> 39:25.758
Is that even, like,
a real cigarette?

39:25.791 --> 39:27.560
Is that even, like,
her real hair?

39:27.593 --> 39:29.028
- Yeah.
- Ooh.

39:29.061 --> 39:32.198
- This is Brazilian. High quality.
- No, it's not.

39:32.231 --> 39:35.601
- Top line. Top line.
- Don't play with me.

39:35.635 --> 39:39.572
So just let me ask, why not just
submit your info for a chance to win?

39:39.605 --> 39:41.173
He woke up late.

39:41.207 --> 39:44.043
Oh, well, now we know
how you got the name Jermaine.

39:46.679 --> 39:48.480
"He woke up late."

39:48.513 --> 39:50.482
You know, you are so pretty.

39:50.515 --> 39:52.018
Yeah, like,
how did you two hook up?

39:52.051 --> 39:54.987
His dad owns the, uh,
gas station over at Ashland,

39:55.021 --> 39:56.856
and I was pumping
my gas one day,

39:56.889 --> 39:59.825
and then one pump led to
another, led to another...

39:59.859 --> 40:01.526
I'm the cashier there.

40:02.194 --> 40:04.496
Draw six cards.

40:04.530 --> 40:05.932
I knew I seen you
somewhere before.

40:07.934 --> 40:10.468
- Yeah.
- Wait a minute.

40:10.502 --> 40:12.905
Okay. Why are you out here
robbing people

40:12.939 --> 40:15.107
if your daddy
owns a gas station?

40:16.108 --> 40:17.944
I'm trying to come up on my own.

40:17.977 --> 40:19.578
That's his money.

40:21.113 --> 40:22.514
By robbing innocent people?

40:22.548 --> 40:25.017
Brother, why you acting
all self-righteous?

40:26.118 --> 40:29.989
I just, um, thought Muslims
were on the up and up.

40:30.022 --> 40:32.524
Fool, who said I was a Muslim?

40:32.558 --> 40:33.659
I'm Baptist.

40:33.693 --> 40:35.728
My pastor's name
is Little Leroy Brown.

40:35.761 --> 40:39.231
Hallelujah. Draw 50.

40:41.600 --> 40:43.102
You know,
can I see your shoes?

40:43.135 --> 40:47.039
I just want to see something.
If I could see your shoes...

40:47.073 --> 40:49.208
I just wanna check.

40:49.241 --> 40:51.744
Oh, well, baby,
he's not wearing golden sandals.

40:51.777 --> 40:53.079
He's definitely not Jafar.

40:53.112 --> 40:54.146
- Stop.
- Yeah.

40:55.781 --> 40:59.285
What is a Black person gonna do with
a billion dollars but spend it all up?

40:59.318 --> 41:01.253
Y'all get rich
and don't even have sense enough

41:01.287 --> 41:03.089
to invest it back
in your own communities.

41:03.122 --> 41:04.924
Y'all dip out to the 'burbs

41:04.957 --> 41:06.025
and then cry
about why you people

41:06.058 --> 41:08.961
don't have something
as simple as a grocery store.

41:08.995 --> 41:10.663
Black people are too proud.

41:10.696 --> 41:12.565
That part.

41:12.598 --> 41:13.899
I'm gonna take that gun
and kill you.

41:14.834 --> 41:16.669
It's the truth, homey.

41:16.702 --> 41:18.137
- I have a friend...
- "Homey."

41:18.170 --> 41:22.174
...who's black, and he won
$10 million in the lotto.

41:22.208 --> 41:25.111
This fool still be standing
on the corner selling weed.

41:25.144 --> 41:27.780
And get this. When he sees
the po-po driving by,

41:27.813 --> 41:31.217
he starts taking down the alley
every single time.

41:31.250 --> 41:33.319
I keep telling the fool
that weed is now legal.

41:33.352 --> 41:35.921
That's a colonized,
programmed mind, my brother.

41:35.955 --> 41:37.690
- He's...
- That part.

41:37.723 --> 41:38.958
Gin rummy.

41:38.991 --> 41:40.192
- Look...
- Gin...

41:40.226 --> 41:42.828
I'm beating y'all
in your own game.

41:42.862 --> 41:45.564
I deserve that money because
I know what to do with it.

41:45.598 --> 41:47.600
I'm gonna use it
to help my people.

41:47.633 --> 41:49.201
We are gonna be living

41:49.235 --> 41:51.337
<i>♪ La vida loca ♪</i>

41:51.370 --> 41:52.938
Oh, so now you Mexican.

41:52.972 --> 41:55.141
Ricky Martin is not Mexican.

41:55.174 --> 41:57.910
Okay, um, you know what,
just give us a second.

41:57.943 --> 42:00.279
We're just gonna talk
some things over.

42:00.312 --> 42:02.014
- Be right back.
- One second.

42:06.118 --> 42:08.254
And this guy's talking 'bout
he's not a Muslim.

42:08.287 --> 42:09.622
And she's clearly a stripper.

42:09.655 --> 42:12.124
I don't know. I don't know anything
about these guys, but, um...

42:12.158 --> 42:13.659
You gotta think
of something, okay?

42:13.692 --> 42:14.794
Okay. I got it.

42:15.361 --> 42:16.328
- You do?
- I got it?

42:16.362 --> 42:18.264
- Good, baby. Go on.
- Watch this. Thank you.

42:19.231 --> 42:20.232
So...

42:22.201 --> 42:24.170
We gonna need y'all to leave
the guns on the table.

42:25.671 --> 42:27.006
You think we're stupid?

42:34.947 --> 42:36.182
Hands are up.

42:37.283 --> 42:40.052
- Just make 'em crazy.
- Baby, oh, my God!

42:40.086 --> 42:41.887
I'm freaking out.
I'm freaking out.

42:41.921 --> 42:43.122
I'm freaking out.
I'm freaking out.

42:43.155 --> 42:44.023
You know,
I eat when I freak out.

42:44.056 --> 42:47.093
No, 'cause I told you,
you're unhappy.

42:47.126 --> 42:49.628
Since you are unhappy with me,
I'm gonna let them kill you...

42:49.662 --> 42:51.430
- 'cause I'm not giving 'em $10 million.
- What? Wait!

42:51.464 --> 42:53.899
- That shit's dead.
- You're gonna let them kill me over 10 million measly dollars?

42:53.933 --> 42:55.401
Yes.

42:55.434 --> 42:57.069
And I'm gonna hit
your mama up in here

42:57.103 --> 42:58.637
- and I'm gonna pay for the funeral, all of it.
- What?

42:58.671 --> 43:00.005
- That's cold.
- I'm just...

43:00.039 --> 43:02.274
How could you do that to me?
You're not funny.

43:02.308 --> 43:04.643
Baby, seriously,
we gotta come up with a plan.

43:04.677 --> 43:06.245
I know. I know. I know.

43:06.278 --> 43:08.781
You got your cell phone on you?
I left mine in the car.

43:08.814 --> 43:10.015
What?

43:10.049 --> 43:12.218
Come on.
My phone is in my purse.

43:12.251 --> 43:13.953
Okay, where is your purse?

43:13.986 --> 43:15.754
In the front room.

43:19.358 --> 43:21.160
Oh.

43:21.193 --> 43:22.228
Oh.

43:23.395 --> 43:25.097
I need that.
I think somebody just...

43:27.199 --> 43:28.868
What was that?

43:28.901 --> 43:32.004
- We can just flush the idea right down.
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

43:32.838 --> 43:35.074
Baby! Duh.

43:35.107 --> 43:39.211
While they're in the front room, why don't
we just get up and leave out the back door?

43:40.112 --> 43:41.147
Boom!

43:41.180 --> 43:42.616
Smart.

43:43.883 --> 43:44.950
- Okay.
- I think we can.

43:46.018 --> 43:47.753
- Okay, so you going in?
- Yeah.

43:47.786 --> 43:49.955
Why don't you go first?
Yeah, that's a good idea. Go first.

43:49.989 --> 43:51.657
- Okay.
- Okay.

43:58.230 --> 43:59.932
Baby, you know,
what's ten million

43:59.965 --> 44:01.400
minus a billion dollars. Right?

44:02.201 --> 44:03.202
Hey?

44:08.908 --> 44:10.743
So are you gonna give us
the money

44:10.776 --> 44:13.445
or have you decided
who wants to die first?

44:13.479 --> 44:16.882
Okay, if we decide,
okay, to give you the money,

44:16.916 --> 44:18.184
just promise you won't kill us.

44:18.217 --> 44:20.886
- But you saw our faces.
- Yep.

44:20.920 --> 44:23.889
Dude, you look like every other
gas attendant in America,

44:23.923 --> 44:25.891
and she looks like every
other stripper in the world.

44:25.925 --> 44:27.860
"Stripper?"

44:27.893 --> 44:30.262
Baby, he knows where I work.
Now we gotta kill...

44:30.296 --> 44:31.363
Wait a minute.

44:31.397 --> 44:33.032
I recognize you.

44:33.065 --> 44:35.034
You're that guy that slid
that $100 bill between my...

44:36.468 --> 44:39.271
No, no, I haven't been to a strip
club in two weeks. On my mama.

44:39.305 --> 44:41.240
- Give us the money or die.
- Now!

44:42.542 --> 44:44.476
You know...

44:44.510 --> 44:46.178
I'm starting to catch on
to you two.

44:46.212 --> 44:47.513
The whole little, um...

44:47.547 --> 44:50.182
- What's that word you say, babe?
- Oh, modus operandi?

44:50.216 --> 44:51.116
Mo...

44:51.150 --> 44:52.619
- Yeah, your modus operandi.
- Yeah.

44:52.652 --> 44:55.321
You know, 'cause it's like,
we literally were just all in the kitchen.

44:55.354 --> 44:57.456
You know, we playing Spades.
They eating our eggs

44:57.489 --> 44:59.158
and all that shit,
we having a good time,

44:59.191 --> 45:01.126
then outta nowhere,
all of a sudden, you just flip,

45:01.160 --> 45:03.429
so it's like obviously,
you two belong to each other,

45:03.462 --> 45:05.364
- because they both have, like...
- Definitely.

45:05.397 --> 45:06.966
Baby, he calling us crazy.

45:06.999 --> 45:08.200
Don't say that.

45:08.234 --> 45:10.469
Baby, I'm gonna shoot
them both now.

45:10.502 --> 45:12.805
I'm gonna shoot you both in the face.

45:12.838 --> 45:14.873
I'm gonna shoot you in the...
In the arms.

45:14.907 --> 45:16.141
In the legs.

45:16.175 --> 45:18.143
I'm gonna shoot you
in the hands.

45:18.177 --> 45:19.546
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna shoot you...

45:19.579 --> 45:21.880
I'm
going to shoot you in the eyelids.

45:21.914 --> 45:23.916
I'm going to shoot you
in the baby toe!

45:23.949 --> 45:25.918
Yes!
They must die!

45:27.554 --> 45:29.521
Baby, where'd they go?

45:29.556 --> 45:32.391
Them clowns are hiding
behind the couch!

45:32.424 --> 45:34.026
Come out from behind there now!

45:34.860 --> 45:35.861
Now!

45:41.867 --> 45:43.902
Yeah, he had to use
the bathroom.

45:43.936 --> 45:46.438
No. No.

45:46.472 --> 45:47.641
No?

45:47.674 --> 45:50.943
We just needed a moment to
convene and figure out how

45:50.976 --> 45:52.945
this situation could be
a win-win for us all.

45:52.978 --> 45:54.547
Right. Mm-hmm.

45:54.581 --> 45:56.181
Win-win.

45:56.215 --> 45:59.518
See, I watch a lot
of <i>Forensic Files</i> right?

45:59.552 --> 46:00.786
- And...
- She does.

46:00.819 --> 46:03.956
...your fingerprints and your
DNA is all over this place.

46:03.989 --> 46:05.924
So, you know,
if you did kill us,

46:05.958 --> 46:08.193
you wouldn't be able to spend
all the money anyway.

46:08.227 --> 46:09.529
Not a dime.

46:15.901 --> 46:17.604
That's my Hollywood laugh

46:17.637 --> 46:22.274
they give to all of us
Middle Easterners "terrorists."

46:22.308 --> 46:24.143
- This nigga crazy.
- Damn.

46:24.176 --> 46:25.511
- Okay.
- Oh...

46:29.014 --> 46:30.316
How was that, baby?

46:30.349 --> 46:31.483
Hollywood to the T.

46:31.517 --> 46:32.619
Do you all hear me?

46:32.652 --> 46:35.387
You know, 'cause what I'm saying
is real, like, you know,

46:35.421 --> 46:37.423
your DNA is literally
all over this place.

46:37.456 --> 46:39.992
So let's deal with how you plan
on getting out of that.

46:40.025 --> 46:44.564
I mean, it's like, obviously, you guys
didn't think this all the way out.

46:44.597 --> 46:48.400
Uh, after we get
the $20 million, we kill you.

46:49.501 --> 46:52.304
And it'll be
about 24 to 48 hours

46:52.338 --> 46:54.106
before anyone
discovers your bodies.

46:54.139 --> 46:55.407
And by that time...

46:57.677 --> 47:00.379
By that time,
we'll be in Mozambique.

47:00.412 --> 47:04.049
And Mozambique has no
extradition treaty with America.

47:04.083 --> 47:08.053
- Right, right, right, so I mean, it's like...
- Pretty clever.

47:08.087 --> 47:10.222
$20 million is a lot of money,

47:10.255 --> 47:12.324
and if the two of us
were to walk into a bank

47:12.358 --> 47:15.427
and try to make a transfer
that large to two idiots

47:15.461 --> 47:17.664
who obviously don't even have
a fucking pot to piss in,

47:17.697 --> 47:20.265
I think it would just raise
so many eyebrows, you know?

47:20.299 --> 47:22.501
- So it's like...
- Mm.

47:22.535 --> 47:24.571
- How about we just give you $500?
- Yeah.

47:24.604 --> 47:26.972
- $500?
- That's what I'm saying.

47:27.005 --> 47:30.042
- Uh, I mean, it's cool. Come on, babe, get up.
- Yeah. Great.

47:33.045 --> 47:35.114
Obviously, you guys
didn't think this part out,

47:35.147 --> 47:36.115
like, you know, but it's fine,

47:36.148 --> 47:37.650
because that's what
you have me here for.

47:37.684 --> 47:39.586
- I'm sorry, baby.
- Us. I'm right here.

47:39.619 --> 47:41.019
That's what
you have us here for.

47:43.222 --> 47:45.057
- So that being said...
- Mm-hmm, yes.

47:45.090 --> 47:49.228
- ...we're not going to call the FBI.
- No, mm-mm.

47:49.261 --> 47:53.932
But... we're gonna need y'all
to run them bitches.

47:58.103 --> 48:00.406
Okay, but just give us the $500.

48:00.439 --> 48:03.676
- $500? Five? Five? Ah-ha!
- Ah-ha!

48:03.710 --> 48:06.412
- It worked, baby!
- $500 this!

48:06.445 --> 48:08.548
Put your hands up, huh. Run it!

48:08.581 --> 48:10.617
How does it feel?
You wanna go rob people, huh?

48:10.650 --> 48:13.553
How does it feel
when the tables have turned?

48:13.586 --> 48:16.955
Run it, run it. Put your motherfucking hands up.

48:16.989 --> 48:18.257
No, I will not.

48:19.592 --> 48:20.860
Put your hands up, babe.

48:20.894 --> 48:23.095
I'm gonna shoot you in your face
if you don't put your hands up.

48:23.128 --> 48:24.263
Yeah, shoot me.

48:24.296 --> 48:27.734
Oh, okay. We got us a brave soul.
A brave soul here.

48:27.767 --> 48:30.269
How about this? I'm-a kill you

48:30.302 --> 48:32.438
and cut all that curly
little hair off your head,

48:32.471 --> 48:34.306
- sell it to some hood chick...
- Mm.

48:34.339 --> 48:37.342
- ...and call it Remy Number Nine.
- Number Nine, ooh!

48:41.046 --> 48:42.649
Put your motherfucking hands up.

48:44.684 --> 48:46.018
Shoot him.

48:46.051 --> 48:47.352
- Yeah, shoot him.
- Shoot him right now.

48:47.386 --> 48:49.321
- Yeah, shoot me.
- Baby, why don't you shoot him?

48:49.354 --> 48:50.757
No, I mean, my parents sent me
to Catholic school.

48:50.790 --> 48:52.625
I can't shoot nobody.
I shoot nobody.

48:52.659 --> 48:53.959
True.

48:56.061 --> 48:58.665
I might just put one in your leg
because you're not listening.

48:58.698 --> 49:00.165
It's gonna hurt a little bit,

49:00.199 --> 49:02.134
but hey, I need you to put
your fucking hands up.

49:02.167 --> 49:06.071
Yeah, yeah, do you... Do you want
me to roll up my pants leg for you?

49:06.104 --> 49:07.439
Huh?

49:07.473 --> 49:09.374
Shoot him in his ass.

49:09.408 --> 49:10.710
- Shoot him in his ass?
- Shoot him in his ass.

49:10.743 --> 49:12.579
- Shoot him in his ass?
- Yeah, shoot him.

49:12.612 --> 49:15.113
- I'm gonna shoot him in his ass.
- Yeah, why don't you just shoot me?

49:15.147 --> 49:17.650
- Count to three in my head, and I'm gonna shoot you.
- Yeah, yeah, shoot me.

49:21.153 --> 49:23.422
- These motherfuckers are not real.
- Oh! Get out of my crib!

49:23.455 --> 49:25.658
<i>Open the door, baby.</i>

49:25.692 --> 49:27.794
<i>Get the fuck out of our crib.</i>

49:27.827 --> 49:30.329
Like, are we gonna keep
running away from our problems,

49:30.362 --> 49:31.798
or can we just live
our best life?

49:31.831 --> 49:35.400
'Cause we just ran away from, like,
50 people back at that mansion.

49:35.434 --> 49:36.836
Yeah.

49:36.870 --> 49:40.773
I was thinking a lot about what that
crazy Jermaine was talking about.

49:40.807 --> 49:44.476
- I mean, the guy's definitely a weirdo...
- Definitely.

49:44.510 --> 49:49.314
But I mean, he was making sense about some of
the stuff he was talking about me, like...

49:50.382 --> 49:52.084
Us as a Black people,

49:54.086 --> 49:57.289
why can't we just build
and create our own communities?

49:57.322 --> 49:59.792
- You know?
- Yeah.

49:59.826 --> 50:03.395
What's stopping us from creating
and building our own communities?

50:03.428 --> 50:04.496
Us.

50:06.231 --> 50:07.232
Exactly.

50:10.703 --> 50:13.505
My brother did invite us over
for dinner tomorrow night.

50:15.107 --> 50:16.174
And what did you say?

50:17.710 --> 50:18.811
Yes?

50:18.845 --> 50:20.547
Oh, no.

50:20.580 --> 50:24.182
- No. Come on, babe! Really?
- I know, baby.

50:24.216 --> 50:27.720
- I'm sorry. We're gonna be in and out, I promise.
- Oh, no. No.

50:27.754 --> 50:29.789
See, we were gonna have
a good night. Move over.

50:41.166 --> 50:42.669
<i>Assalamu alaikum.</i>

50:49.441 --> 50:52.377
- Wow! Damn. Whoo.
- Whoo!

50:52.411 --> 50:56.214
I landed in this soul food
with both my feet.

50:56.248 --> 51:00.285
This is gonna be the best soul
food meal you guys ever had

51:00.319 --> 51:02.321
in your natural-born
Black lives matter.

51:02.354 --> 51:03.756
Yes. I'm telling you, man.

51:03.790 --> 51:06.759
This pound cake
is like, like, wham!

51:06.793 --> 51:09.328
- Pound cake better than Grandma's. Yeah.
- Huh.

51:09.361 --> 51:11.664
Aw! You are so sweet!

51:11.698 --> 51:13.866
- Give me a kiss.
- Oh, Lord!

51:13.900 --> 51:16.636
Now, don't press too hard.
You know it smears my lip gloss.

51:16.669 --> 51:20.138
- Yes. Can I have another one?
- Look at that chicken.

51:20.172 --> 51:21.440
Kissing you.

51:21.473 --> 51:23.508
- Now, that was the perfect kiss.
- Oh, my God.

51:23.543 --> 51:26.713
- Mm, mm, mm.
- Good time, baby.

51:26.746 --> 51:29.916
- Okay. We got fried chicken...
- Yeah.

51:29.949 --> 51:32.217
...potato salad
without the raisins.

51:32.250 --> 51:34.152
I see the memes on Facebook,

51:34.186 --> 51:37.189
and I know you guys hate raisins
in your potato salad.

51:37.222 --> 51:39.559
I made a collard greens,

51:39.592 --> 51:42.160
corn bread...

51:42.194 --> 51:43.730
- ...yams...
- Yams!

51:45.197 --> 51:47.366
- ...and chitlins.
- Chitlins!

51:47.399 --> 51:50.837
Now, how do you people
eat that stuff?

51:50.870 --> 51:53.640
- "You people?"
- My entire house was funky.

51:53.673 --> 51:55.675
Little stank.
I was a little funky.

51:55.708 --> 51:57.777
It was funky.
Okay, Rachel Dolezal.

51:57.810 --> 52:00.880
I see you, girl.
Uh, what's that over there?

52:02.214 --> 52:06.184
It's authentic soul food,
my sister.

52:06.218 --> 52:08.588
We're going green.
Like, literally.

52:08.621 --> 52:10.790
Green eggs and ham,
let's do it, Sam.

52:10.823 --> 52:13.291
But in your case, Kareem.
Let's eat, baby.

52:13.325 --> 52:15.360
Come on! You ready? Let's do it.

52:15.394 --> 52:17.462
- All right.
- Give me some, girl.

52:17.496 --> 52:19.632
This is... Man, I love it.

52:19.666 --> 52:23.201
I'm so excited. Wow!

52:24.403 --> 52:26.371
- My big brother Darryl.
- Yeah, man.

52:26.405 --> 52:28.273
So, like, um, is something wrong

52:28.306 --> 52:29.976
or you just wanted to spend some
time with your little brother?

52:30.009 --> 52:33.680
Man! Come on, now. You know I've
always had a soft spot for you, Kareem.

52:33.713 --> 52:35.548
- Mm.
- I love you, man.

52:35.581 --> 52:36.849
- Of course.
- Hey. Uh, sweetie.

52:36.883 --> 52:39.384
Can you please get me
some grape Kool-Aid?

52:39.418 --> 52:42.655
- When we were kids, you loved grape.
- Yeah.

52:42.689 --> 52:44.724
- You don't want any grape? Kool-Aid, babe.
- Nah, I'm good.

52:44.757 --> 52:47.359
Kool-Aid man's in the building.

52:47.392 --> 52:49.529
I thought that was just
brilliant marketing.

52:49.562 --> 52:52.497
I never forgot that commercial.
It was so awesome.

52:52.532 --> 52:53.766
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

52:53.800 --> 52:54.934
Obviously.

52:54.967 --> 52:56.903
So, what...
what's going on with dinner?

52:56.936 --> 52:59.839
You guys didn't really...
didn't really eat.

53:00.840 --> 53:01.941
Yeah, we're vegans.

53:02.975 --> 53:04.476
Oh, wow!

53:04.509 --> 53:06.612
Well, what you gonna do
with those three, four,

53:06.646 --> 53:09.582
five dozen eggs
you got in your fridge, there?

53:09.615 --> 53:12.250
Well, those were...
vegan chickens.

53:12.284 --> 53:13.653
Wow! They're making
vegan chickens?

53:13.686 --> 53:17.590
Yeah. You'd be surprised.

53:17.623 --> 53:19.357
I don't know why.

53:19.391 --> 53:21.526
Uh, the chicken was bloody.

53:21.561 --> 53:23.529
Well, that was
their grandmother's recipe.

53:23.563 --> 53:24.630
The hell it is.

53:24.664 --> 53:26.999
I have eaten plenty
of fried chicken at her house,

53:27.033 --> 53:29.736
and I have never seen blood come from it.
Not one time.

53:29.769 --> 53:31.537
And let me tell you something
about Black people.

53:31.571 --> 53:33.740
See, we like our food
cooked to the core.

53:33.773 --> 53:36.943
You know what I'm saying?
Otherwise it's, "Waiter! Manager!"

53:36.976 --> 53:39.779
"This bill is comped and we need
a gift certificate. Thank you."

53:39.812 --> 53:41.013
You're being a little mean.

53:41.047 --> 53:42.447
You know that fried chicken
was better than

53:42.481 --> 53:45.051
some of the fried chicken I had
when I was a little kid growing up.

53:45.084 --> 53:46.586
Nigga, stop lying.

53:46.619 --> 53:48.821
Baby!

53:48.855 --> 53:51.991
They didn't eat my fried chicken
or my collards!

53:52.024 --> 53:53.593
Ooh, come on. Come on.

53:53.626 --> 53:57.830
Come on, they're... They're... They don't
know what good soul food tastes like.

53:57.864 --> 53:59.031
They're... They're vegan.

53:59.065 --> 54:01.033
Yeah. You know,
we be eating carrots and everything.

54:01.067 --> 54:03.301
All you gotta do is you
should've brought some carrots.

54:03.335 --> 54:04.469
Right. Just take it
out the garden.

54:04.503 --> 54:05.705
We don't even cook it.
Right, baby?

54:05.738 --> 54:08.340
We just don't even add salt and pepper.
We just eat it.

54:08.373 --> 54:11.409
I put lemon pepper
on my carrots, by the way.

54:11.443 --> 54:12.712
Yes. They don't know.

54:12.745 --> 54:15.681
They didn't like
my soul food!

54:15.715 --> 54:19.085
Baby, baby! They don't know
what good soul food tastes like.

54:19.118 --> 54:23.488
Well, we do know that it's not
supposed to taste like Michelin tires.

54:23.522 --> 54:24.690
We know that much.

54:24.724 --> 54:27.492
And that was not collard greens
in those pots. I'm sorry.

54:27.526 --> 54:29.996
Why would you say that, Nora?
That's mean.

54:30.029 --> 54:32.865
It was reefer.
Like, the girl went and cooked reefer.

54:32.899 --> 54:33.900
Cooked reefer.

54:35.668 --> 54:38.704
Babe, you didn't cook
my reefer, did you?

54:38.738 --> 54:42.474
I thought
it was collard greens!

54:42.507 --> 54:45.410
- That was the best reefer greens.
- Who does that?

54:45.443 --> 54:48.080
I... I put hot sauce on that, babe.

54:48.114 --> 54:51.316
Aw. Come on. You guys coulda
added some Johnny Pete's. Come on.

54:52.552 --> 54:54.419
Could've put hot sauce
on it, Reem.

54:54.452 --> 54:55.922
- Right, right, right.
- Mm-hmm.

54:55.955 --> 54:58.423
- You could've washed it down a little grape.
- Yeah. You're right. Yeah.

54:58.456 --> 54:59.959
Hell, yeah.

54:59.992 --> 55:02.862
- I'm still hungry. Can we go eat, please? Thank you.
- Gotcha.

55:03.896 --> 55:05.832
So, how can we help you, Darryl?

55:05.865 --> 55:07.900
You know, man. I, uh...

55:07.934 --> 55:09.735
You know, I... I want a share.

55:09.769 --> 55:11.103
You think I can share?

55:12.004 --> 55:13.471
What do you mean, a share?

55:13.505 --> 55:16.976
Last week, I asked you for a $20 bump
on my paycheck and you told me no.

55:17.009 --> 55:20.112
Now, you think we're supposed to
give you something of what we got?

55:20.146 --> 55:22.114
- Kareem...
- It doesn't work like that.

55:22.148 --> 55:24.951
Okay. I get it, buddy. Hey.
Have you paid the IRS yet?

55:24.984 --> 55:26.886
Hell, yeah. I gave their ass
like $10 four years ago.

55:26.919 --> 55:28.386
We should definitely
be straight now.

55:28.420 --> 55:30.455
No! Kareem,
$10 is not gonna cut it.

55:30.488 --> 55:32.825
Okay, look. There's two things
that you have to do.

55:32.859 --> 55:34.927
All right? You have to pay that...
that rapper.

55:34.961 --> 55:39.732
What, the 20%...
30, 35 and a quarter. What is it?

55:39.765 --> 55:42.400
- 50 Cent?
- 50 Cents! There you go

55:42.434 --> 55:45.872
The 50 Cent guy.
You pay him, you pay the IRS.

55:45.905 --> 55:49.075
That's what you have to do.
There's no way to get around that. Okay?

55:49.108 --> 55:54.680
All right. So I can't believe they gave
a Negro like you a billion dollars,

55:54.714 --> 55:56.949
with no financial wherewithal.
Nothing, huh?

55:56.983 --> 55:59.417
Just slid you
a good old smooth bill, huh?

55:59.451 --> 56:01.621
- Yeah.
- Wow, man.

56:01.654 --> 56:02.922
You know, I...

56:02.955 --> 56:07.760
I just want to tell you.
A fool and his money will soon part.

56:07.793 --> 56:08.895
Hmm.

56:08.928 --> 56:13.099
Like, why do you think
we are always broke when we die?

56:13.132 --> 56:14.767
It's no secret, all right?

56:14.800 --> 56:16.769
Look, man.
I gotta keep this down low.

56:16.802 --> 56:19.138
Because if my wife
hears me say...

56:19.171 --> 56:21.741
She doesn't like me
saying the color "white."

56:21.774 --> 56:24.476
Oh, she gets angry, like...

56:24.509 --> 56:27.079
So, I think she's sweating us
out in here. All right?

56:27.113 --> 56:29.949
We made our little
green-eggs-and-ham cornbread,

56:29.982 --> 56:31.884
and I'm burning up
like a pig in heat.

56:31.918 --> 56:35.087
- Hmm.
- Now, I hope that she doesn't hear us,

56:35.121 --> 56:40.525
but white people
invest their money.

56:40.559 --> 56:42.795
- That's right.
- I think they spend their money just like I spend money.

56:42.828 --> 56:44.797
Kareem,
are you listening to me?

56:44.830 --> 56:47.133
I'm down here
sweating my ass off.

56:47.166 --> 56:49.467
Are you hearing me? They invest,

56:49.501 --> 56:52.104
Kareem, not spend. Invest.

56:52.138 --> 56:53.873
- Okay?
- Right.

56:53.906 --> 56:55.574
Look.

56:55.608 --> 56:58.844
We bring in $1.2 trillion.

56:58.878 --> 57:01.479
That is more
than some countries, all right?

57:01.513 --> 57:03.783
But then we got our little
athletes out there, right?

57:03.816 --> 57:06.852
We've got our rappers,
our 50 Cents,

57:06.886 --> 57:10.022
and they're freaking raining dollar
bills on booties and strip clubs.

57:10.056 --> 57:13.092
Five K, ten K, 20 K.

57:13.125 --> 57:14.627
Kareem, that's crazy.

57:15.728 --> 57:18.564
Yeah, um... Told you.

57:21.534 --> 57:22.535
Hey, babe.

57:23.202 --> 57:24.170
Babe, hey!

57:24.203 --> 57:27.707
Hey! What's, what's, what's...
what's going on?

57:27.740 --> 57:30.776
Did I just hear you
say the word "white"?

57:34.313 --> 57:37.515
- Come on, dude.
- What? I would never... I've never even used the word...

57:37.550 --> 57:40.152
You're like my snow mountaintop.

57:40.186 --> 57:41.854
I love you. I mean, come on.

57:41.887 --> 57:43.889
I'll slalom your ass any day,
babe. Come on.

57:45.224 --> 57:46.826
I told you, man.

57:46.859 --> 57:49.862
She's always listening,
all right? Now...

57:49.895 --> 57:53.065
This is a little racist and the
audience is probably gonna be so pissed,

57:53.099 --> 57:54.667
but look, man, I got to say it.

57:54.700 --> 57:55.935
It is what it is, all right?

57:55.968 --> 57:58.871
- You're a wealthy Black man, okay?
- Indeed.

57:59.605 --> 58:02.074
You gotta get rid of <i>chiquita.</i>

58:02.742 --> 58:04.577
And <i>Quilla Chicaniqua...</i>

58:04.610 --> 58:06.812
- Nora. Her name is Nora.
- Who?

58:07.913 --> 58:10.116
Nora, Dora. Same thing.

58:10.149 --> 58:13.219
Does she explore? No. Okay?
What I'm telling you is this.

58:13.252 --> 58:15.855
Give her
a couple million, right?

58:15.888 --> 58:17.957
Let her go live her life.

58:17.990 --> 58:20.092
You're a wealthy Black man.

58:20.126 --> 58:23.262
They are never gonna let you
express your full Blackness.

58:23.295 --> 58:25.998
Uh, what is it? The darker the
berry, the sweeter the juice.

58:26.032 --> 58:28.234
Well, you're like prune juice.

58:28.267 --> 58:32.271
What you do, man,
you go get you a pure white.

58:32.304 --> 58:35.107
I mean, you go
get you a ooh-wee.

58:35.141 --> 58:37.843
A snowflake, Popsicle...

58:39.045 --> 58:42.114
mountain top, Q-tip.

58:42.148 --> 58:44.583
Cocaine. You know what I mean?

58:44.617 --> 58:47.653
That's it, man. I don't know
where I would be without my wife.

58:47.686 --> 58:49.255
There's no telling, man. I'd...

58:49.288 --> 58:51.090
probably be doing drive-bys.

58:51.123 --> 58:53.325
- Hmm.
- Chi-Town's finest.

58:53.359 --> 58:54.894
Out the window. Bang!

58:54.927 --> 58:57.329
- Yeah.
- You can get your 40 acres and a mule, man.

58:58.064 --> 58:59.365
You know?

58:59.398 --> 59:01.267
I'm serious.

59:01.300 --> 59:03.169
- Darryl.
- Yeah, man.

59:05.805 --> 59:08.174
You is what we call a "Nigga."

59:08.207 --> 59:10.176
Bean pie, anyone?

59:10.209 --> 59:12.111
- Yeah.
- Bean pie?

59:12.144 --> 59:13.712
I make them
from scratch.

59:13.746 --> 59:14.847
- Mm.
- Oh.

59:14.880 --> 59:18.084
My wife makes
the best bean pies.

59:18.117 --> 59:20.019
I'm talk about
her sweet potato pies

59:20.052 --> 59:22.321
will have Patti LaBelle
kick her shoes right off.

59:22.354 --> 59:23.823
- Oh.
- Wow.

59:23.856 --> 59:27.026
Are those <i>Assalamu-alaikum-</i>
sharp-as-a-tack-in-100-degree-weather

59:27.059 --> 59:29.028
with-a-two-piece suit
and-a-bow-tie bean pie?

59:29.061 --> 59:30.496
Yes, my sister.

59:30.530 --> 59:34.667
My husband has given you all the
warning that my bean pies are better.

59:34.700 --> 59:37.636
Yes, they are
absolutely finger-licking.

59:37.670 --> 59:39.105
Oh, I would just lick your...

59:39.138 --> 59:41.040
- Oh, wow.
- This, darling, is so good.

59:41.073 --> 59:43.275
I just wanted to know,
do you ever get sick from eating her food?

59:43.309 --> 59:46.712
Uh, no, uh, Nora the Explorer.

59:46.745 --> 59:49.949
Okay? Excuse me.

59:49.982 --> 59:53.352
You know, I actually, uh...
love my wife's food.

59:54.787 --> 59:55.988
You know what?
We're here for a loan.

59:56.021 --> 59:57.990
Excuse me. How about that?
I'm speaking to...

59:58.023 --> 1:00:00.092
- No!
- What do you mean "no"?

1:00:00.126 --> 1:00:02.361
- Why?
- What you mean "why?"

1:00:02.394 --> 1:00:04.330
Kareem, why can't I have a loan?

1:00:05.898 --> 1:00:07.099
It's our money.

1:00:07.133 --> 1:00:08.400
Oh, I swear.

1:00:08.434 --> 1:00:10.903
You know,
Peter was right about you.

1:00:10.936 --> 1:00:13.139
Bro, what do I care about
what Peter thinks?

1:00:13.172 --> 1:00:15.207
I mean,
I'm a whole Black billionaire.

1:00:15.241 --> 1:00:17.743
Billionaires have
feelings too, Kareem.

1:00:17.776 --> 1:00:19.078
Mm. No, actually, we don't.

1:00:19.111 --> 1:00:21.847
I lost all of my feelings after
I got my first billion dollars.

1:00:21.881 --> 1:00:26.218
Now, I do care about people
like Bill Gates, Warren Buffett,

1:00:26.252 --> 1:00:27.987
but absolutely not you,

1:00:28.020 --> 1:00:29.688
you, and definitely not Peter.

1:00:29.722 --> 1:00:35.761
But I do, however, care about what my
beautiful Black Queen thinks of me, though.

1:00:35.794 --> 1:00:37.396
That's right, King. Tell 'em.

1:00:37.429 --> 1:00:40.199
What? Kareem,
if you didn't care

1:00:40.232 --> 1:00:42.001
what we thought about you,

1:00:42.034 --> 1:00:44.737
why are you so emotional?

1:00:44.770 --> 1:00:46.939
Emotional? Oh, baby,
I'm not emotional.

1:00:46.972 --> 1:00:49.975
Now, however, I might be angry from
eating your chicken and dumplings.

1:00:50.009 --> 1:00:52.811
I mean, I've had to boo-boo ever
since we got up from dinner.

1:00:52.845 --> 1:00:54.046
Wow.

1:00:54.079 --> 1:00:56.916
My bowels hurt so bad,
I'm about to cry.

1:00:56.949 --> 1:00:59.985
And, you know I don't care about
what this fool... Matter of fact...

1:01:00.019 --> 1:01:02.254
Uh-oh. Kareem! Kareem!
- Baby! Baby?

1:01:02.288 --> 1:01:04.190
- Kareem!
- Yeah.

1:01:06.058 --> 1:01:08.394
- Mm.
- Oh, he's done it now.

1:01:10.029 --> 1:01:12.231
Kareem, I...

1:01:14.500 --> 1:01:16.135
Come on, baby.

1:01:16.168 --> 1:01:17.336
She's crying?

1:01:20.172 --> 1:01:25.211
I refuse to eat a bean pie
prepared by a white woman.

1:01:25.244 --> 1:01:26.478
Damn, damn!

1:01:26.512 --> 1:01:29.481
Did he just toss away
my bean pie?

1:01:29.515 --> 1:01:31.250
Yeah.

1:01:31.283 --> 1:01:33.786
Oh, my God.
You guys are in trouble.

1:01:33.819 --> 1:01:35.421
Why? What is she about to do?

1:01:35.454 --> 1:01:37.523
I don't know.
I'll let you figure that out yourself.

1:01:37.557 --> 1:01:39.925
I'll be over here. That's all I can say.

1:01:39.959 --> 1:01:42.094
- Where is she going?
- What's she about to do?

1:01:42.127 --> 1:01:43.462
You'll find out.

1:01:43.495 --> 1:01:44.430
- I don't...
- Oh, no.

1:01:44.463 --> 1:01:45.798
She probably out there
calling the police,

1:01:45.831 --> 1:01:48.767
- reporting us for not eating that nasty cornbread.
- Oh, my God!

1:01:48.801 --> 1:01:50.336
The cornbread was emerald green.

1:01:50.369 --> 1:01:52.304
- I've never seen cornbread that was green!
- Three...

1:01:52.338 --> 1:01:54.139
- Two...
- Please don't come in here with a gun.

1:01:54.173 --> 1:01:55.941
...one. You'll see.

1:01:55.975 --> 1:01:57.476
Oh, my... Baby.

1:01:57.509 --> 1:02:00.079
- What she got? What she...
- I don't know. I don't know.

1:02:02.982 --> 1:02:04.950
Nobody messes
with my bean pie!

1:02:07.886 --> 1:02:10.856
Oh, Heavens to Murgatroyd.
You could have put some of my clothes on.

1:02:10.889 --> 1:02:13.926
Stop hating, bro.
You see these guns?

1:02:13.959 --> 1:02:15.961
Gonna O.J. your white wife
away from you.

1:02:15.995 --> 1:02:17.496
Boy, please.

1:02:17.530 --> 1:02:21.433
You so skinny, if you turned
sideways, you'd be invisible.

1:02:23.469 --> 1:02:25.838
Rachel,
that was, like, such an amazing joke.

1:02:25.871 --> 1:02:27.406
Like, so original.

1:02:27.439 --> 1:02:30.175
You even added Caucasian to it.
Like, you should be so proud of yourself.

1:02:30.209 --> 1:02:31.443
No, really.

1:02:31.477 --> 1:02:34.813
He's so skinny, if he turned
sideways, he'd be invisible.

1:02:34.847 --> 1:02:36.515
Figuratively speaking.

1:02:36.549 --> 1:02:37.883
No, I'm serious.

1:02:37.916 --> 1:02:40.452
He's, like,
42 pounds soaking wet.

1:02:40.486 --> 1:02:42.855
Y'all are just gonna sit here and
make me the butt of y'all jokes?

1:02:42.888 --> 1:02:45.391
Come on, stand up.

1:02:50.029 --> 1:02:52.031
Turn around. Watch.
You gonna be invisible.

1:02:57.637 --> 1:02:59.539
He's gone. Told you.

1:02:59.572 --> 1:03:01.240
You can turn back around now.

1:03:01.273 --> 1:03:02.441
Oh, he's back.

1:03:04.644 --> 1:03:07.212
Okay. Now that we have
everyone's attention...

1:03:07.246 --> 1:03:09.248
We invited you all here

1:03:09.281 --> 1:03:13.085
because we believe
that you should support us.

1:03:13.118 --> 1:03:16.589
We want white people money.

1:03:16.623 --> 1:03:17.856
Thank you.

1:03:17.890 --> 1:03:20.627
Why does everyone feel like
y'all are entitled to my money?

1:03:20.660 --> 1:03:22.595
We don't think we're entitled.

1:03:22.629 --> 1:03:25.565
We only think it's fair
that you share.

1:03:25.598 --> 1:03:28.267
I asked that fool for $20
last week and he told me no.

1:03:28.300 --> 1:03:29.435
What's that got to do with me?

1:03:29.468 --> 1:03:32.171
Baby,
you told me to tell him no. "Say no."

1:03:32.204 --> 1:03:34.406
- Be quiet and let me do the talking.
- Okay.

1:03:34.440 --> 1:03:36.508
We see who wears the pants
in that relationship.

1:03:36.543 --> 1:03:39.511
No, no, no. Ha-ha!
I wear the pants. Okay?

1:03:39.546 --> 1:03:42.181
I'm just happy
to have my Dove bar.

1:03:42.214 --> 1:03:43.550
Oh, hush.

1:03:43.583 --> 1:03:45.284
Yes, baby.

1:03:46.919 --> 1:03:49.088
Black people are gonna trip
when they see this.

1:03:49.121 --> 1:03:50.255
Yes. With his goofy ass.

1:03:50.289 --> 1:03:53.392
Especially when they find out
you support Donald Trump.

1:03:53.425 --> 1:03:54.694
I do not!

1:03:54.728 --> 1:03:58.030
We gonna tell 'em that if you
don't give us the $500 million.

1:03:58.063 --> 1:04:00.265
Oh! Okay.
Well, with that being said,

1:04:00.299 --> 1:04:02.434
I think you have every right
in the world to know

1:04:02.468 --> 1:04:05.572
that your husband
follows O.J. Simpson on Twitter.

1:04:05.605 --> 1:04:09.609
I don't... Why? I don't...
I don't do that. No. No.

1:04:09.642 --> 1:04:12.111
- He don't do that.
- Yeah.

1:04:12.144 --> 1:04:15.147
Do you follow O.J. Simpson on Twitter?

1:04:15.180 --> 1:04:16.448
Hon, no, what? What? No.

1:04:16.482 --> 1:04:20.018
Yeah. He follows him for, like,
motivational dating purposes.

1:04:20.052 --> 1:04:21.286
Give me your phone.

1:04:21.320 --> 1:04:23.355
- Huh? Come on, babe.
- "Huh"?

1:04:23.389 --> 1:04:27.326
Don't have me to repeat myself,
Darryl Dantelea Johnson.

1:04:27.359 --> 1:04:29.629
Hey, you better not
give up that phone.

1:04:31.163 --> 1:04:33.465
Give me your damn phone, now!

1:04:33.499 --> 1:04:34.967
Hey, babe...

1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:38.103
Man, you better not
give up that phone!

1:04:39.706 --> 1:04:43.275
Ghost of Malcolm X,
where's your... Be cool!

1:04:43.308 --> 1:04:46.311
Okay. Okay. Stop, stop, stop.
Okay, just stop.

1:04:47.747 --> 1:04:49.481
I have something
that I need to say.

1:04:51.316 --> 1:04:54.486
I had an actor

1:04:54.520 --> 1:04:57.523
to come and send you that text.

1:04:57.557 --> 1:04:58.758
To send Kareem the text.

1:04:58.792 --> 1:05:02.127
He didn't win the billion dollars.
I set up everything.

1:05:02.161 --> 1:05:04.430
- Okay? So...
- Oh...

1:05:04.463 --> 1:05:06.231
You can forget
about telling America

1:05:06.265 --> 1:05:08.066
that Kareem is
a Donald Trump supporter

1:05:08.100 --> 1:05:09.702
because they will stop
supporting my shoe store.

1:05:09.736 --> 1:05:11.336
They will literally boycott me.

1:05:11.370 --> 1:05:13.071
- You're lying.
- I'm not lying.

1:05:13.105 --> 1:05:14.574
Prove it.

1:05:14.607 --> 1:05:16.341
I'm-a prove it right now.

1:05:16.375 --> 1:05:20.446
I don't believe her.
She's full of it.

1:05:20.479 --> 1:05:22.314
Yeah.
You can come on in right now.

1:05:22.347 --> 1:05:23.716
What are you doing?

1:05:25.517 --> 1:05:26.853
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I'm Brandon.

1:05:26.886 --> 1:05:30.956
I was hired by Nora Newsome to
pretend to work for Miss Bezos.

1:05:33.058 --> 1:05:34.059
What?

1:05:36.328 --> 1:05:38.230
Why would you do this?

1:05:38.263 --> 1:05:41.333
What about the car? The mansion?

1:05:41.366 --> 1:05:44.369
The mansion and the Bentley
all belong to my uncle.

1:05:44.403 --> 1:05:46.606
We actually hacked
into your computer

1:05:46.639 --> 1:05:49.041
to make it look like
you were making a purchase.

1:05:51.243 --> 1:05:56.415
So, he doesn't have
a billion dollars.

1:05:56.448 --> 1:05:59.151
No, he doesn't even have $100.

1:05:59.184 --> 1:06:01.520
In fact,
when I hacked into your account,

1:06:01.554 --> 1:06:05.224
I decided to start
a GoFundMe page.

1:06:07.092 --> 1:06:08.160
I can't believe it.

1:06:08.193 --> 1:06:11.430
So you had me cook
all this soul food for nothing?

1:06:11.463 --> 1:06:13.700
Give me your damn cell phone.

1:06:13.733 --> 1:06:15.668
Babe, come...

1:06:19.539 --> 1:06:21.574
You just unfollowed O.J.

1:06:21.608 --> 1:06:24.309
We don't need you
getting any bright ideas.

1:06:25.712 --> 1:06:28.815
I'm going to my "war" room,

1:06:28.848 --> 1:06:30.449
so see yourselves out.

1:06:36.121 --> 1:06:39.626
So, there's no...
billion dollars.

1:06:44.631 --> 1:06:46.799
No billion dollars.
I'm an actor.

1:06:46.833 --> 1:06:48.768
I can't believe it.

1:06:51.804 --> 1:06:53.205
You know what?

1:06:53.238 --> 1:06:57.142
All I know is you better be in to
work first thing tomorrow morning.

1:06:57.175 --> 1:06:59.211
And if you're
even two seconds late,

1:06:59.244 --> 1:07:01.681
two seconds, Kareem,
you're fired!

1:07:03.215 --> 1:07:04.483
I'm going to my man cave.

1:07:04.516 --> 1:07:06.418
You two let yourselves
out of here.

1:07:07.319 --> 1:07:08.621
This is ridiculous.

1:07:10.355 --> 1:07:11.356
I could kill you.

1:07:14.126 --> 1:07:17.396
Why would you go and post that we're
billionaires all over your social media page?

1:07:17.429 --> 1:07:19.532
You all said no news.

1:07:19.566 --> 1:07:22.167
What's going on?

1:07:23.002 --> 1:07:25.270
So, I had
this fool come over

1:07:25.304 --> 1:07:27.774
to just pretend
that we didn't win the money.

1:07:32.311 --> 1:07:34.446
So do we have
a billion dollars or not?

1:07:34.479 --> 1:07:35.514
Yes.

1:07:36.849 --> 1:07:41.588
Yes. We have a billion dollars,
baby.

1:07:41.621 --> 1:07:44.456
Listen, I just...
I got everything you were saying.

1:07:44.489 --> 1:07:47.192
You know, about when people find
out you make a lot of money,

1:07:47.225 --> 1:07:49.729
they don't want to build with you.
They just wanna take.

1:07:49.762 --> 1:07:52.765
So, I say we buy our building,

1:07:52.799 --> 1:07:54.132
fix it up,

1:07:54.166 --> 1:07:56.903
and we just start investing in
what we already have around us.

1:07:56.936 --> 1:07:59.438
And, see, I'm...
I'm actually an actor.

1:07:59.471 --> 1:08:03.475
Well, I'm not really an actor,
but you saw my chops.

1:08:10.717 --> 1:08:11.751
I agree.

1:08:15.220 --> 1:08:16.889
Okay. Okay.

1:08:16.923 --> 1:08:18.591
- So, listen.
- Yes.

1:08:18.625 --> 1:08:20.392
- From now on...
- Mm-hmm?

1:08:20.425 --> 1:08:23.428
- ...everything we do is done in secrecy.
- Okay.

1:08:23.462 --> 1:08:25.898
We have to hide the fact
that we have this money

1:08:25.932 --> 1:08:28.568
and make it appear
as if someone else

1:08:28.601 --> 1:08:31.671
is helping the community.

1:08:31.704 --> 1:08:35.173
We need Black people to support
Black-owned businesses,

1:08:35.207 --> 1:08:37.342
just like they do
Popeyes chicken.

1:08:37.376 --> 1:08:39.646
Yeah, but they can
never know you're Black.

1:08:39.679 --> 1:08:41.380
Now, that s a shame.

1:08:41.413 --> 1:08:42.615
A real shame.

1:08:42.649 --> 1:08:44.416
Well, I have an idea.

1:08:44.449 --> 1:08:46.318
Uh, I'd like to open
a doughnut shop

1:08:46.351 --> 1:08:48.387
and name it after
my wife, Becky Sue.

1:08:48.420 --> 1:08:50.455
Can I get two million?

1:08:50.489 --> 1:08:52.725
Uh, just don't post
about us anymore.

1:08:52.759 --> 1:08:56.562
Ooh! You got me goin'!

1:08:56.596 --> 1:09:00.265
- I'm sorry, baby.
- I love you.

1:09:04.804 --> 1:09:06.471
I ain't mad at you.

1:09:07.472 --> 1:09:09.508
Look, baby...

1:09:09.542 --> 1:09:11.443
I know I joke around a lot...

1:09:12.912 --> 1:09:14.279
but I really love you.

1:09:15.280 --> 1:09:17.249
Aw, I know.

1:09:17.282 --> 1:09:18.618
I can always look in your eyes

1:09:18.651 --> 1:09:20.452
and they tell me
how you feel about me.

1:09:20.485 --> 1:09:22.254
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

1:09:24.356 --> 1:09:26.592
- Well, what do they say right now?
- Mm...

1:09:28.895 --> 1:09:30.630
Then it is time to go home.

1:09:30.663 --> 1:09:32.899
Yeah, it's time.
It's about that time.

1:09:32.932 --> 1:09:34.466
- Oh...
- Let's go.

1:09:35.267 --> 1:09:36.401
What's wrong, baby?

1:09:36.435 --> 1:09:38.303
Baby?

1:09:38.336 --> 1:09:39.806
Baby,
I gotta boo-boo.

1:09:39.839 --> 1:09:40.840
What? Oh!

1:09:59.892 --> 1:10:01.894
My baby.

1:10:02.662 --> 1:10:03.796
Good morning, baby.

1:10:16.008 --> 1:10:17.810
Oh, babe.

1:10:17.844 --> 1:10:20.880
I haven't seen you up
this early since... never.

1:10:20.913 --> 1:10:24.584
Yeah. You know I decided to
be on time for work today.

1:10:24.617 --> 1:10:27.519
Oh! You wait until
we're filthy rich.

1:10:27.553 --> 1:10:29.055
Yeah. Well, you know,
I'm using this

1:10:29.088 --> 1:10:31.624
as an opportunity
to discipline myself.

1:10:31.657 --> 1:10:33.358
- Mm.
- Yeah.

1:10:33.391 --> 1:10:34.627
Sounds good.

1:10:34.660 --> 1:10:36.696
- I like it. Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

1:10:39.031 --> 1:10:40.700
You know, actually,

1:10:40.733 --> 1:10:42.467
we really need to go day by day

1:10:42.501 --> 1:10:44.771
convincing people
like our coworkers,

1:10:44.804 --> 1:10:47.372
friends and family members,
etcetera, etcetera,

1:10:47.405 --> 1:10:49.876
that we still
the same broke-ass people.

1:10:51.010 --> 1:10:52.344
You think you can do that?

1:10:52.812 --> 1:10:54.547
Yeah. Yes, we can.

1:10:54.580 --> 1:10:56.348
- Yeah...
- We can do that.

1:10:56.381 --> 1:10:57.917
Go ahead on, Obama. Hey.

1:10:57.950 --> 1:11:00.987
- All right. Well, I'm-a get back to...
- You are? Okay.

1:11:01.020 --> 1:11:02.755
- I'll be up in a second.
- You look good there.

1:11:02.789 --> 1:11:03.956
Oh, thank you, baby.

1:11:03.990 --> 1:11:06.324
- All right, I see your muscles.
- They see you, too, baby.

1:11:06.358 --> 1:11:08.060
- Well, get to it.
- Mm...

1:11:08.094 --> 1:11:11.597
- Well, you...
- Sir, like I said, I am not about to keep talking over you.

1:11:11.631 --> 1:11:13.566
- I've showed you all the...
- Hey!

1:11:16.702 --> 1:11:17.804
Where's Peter?

1:11:36.556 --> 1:11:40.626
Well, you know, that's a term
everyone in the hood knows.

1:11:40.660 --> 1:11:43.963
Like, you know,
"We out here grindin'."

1:11:43.996 --> 1:11:45.031
You know, that's what we say.

1:11:45.064 --> 1:11:47.099
You know, "I need to make
this white people money."

1:11:47.133 --> 1:11:49.001
- Yeah.
- You know, I gotta get paid.

1:11:49.035 --> 1:11:50.002
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:11:50.036 --> 1:11:52.470
Now, before we begin,
we want everyone to know

1:11:52.504 --> 1:11:55.473
that this is actually
based on a real story.

1:11:55.507 --> 1:11:57.977
Um, it's actually our story.

1:11:58.010 --> 1:11:59.879
I'm the real Nora Newsome,

1:11:59.912 --> 1:12:03.415
and we've actually financed this
with our own money.

1:12:03.448 --> 1:12:06.518
So, basically, what happened was
I saw <i>Black & Privileged,</i>

1:12:06.552 --> 1:12:09.387
which is a film directed
and written by Mark Harris.

1:12:09.421 --> 1:12:11.523
- Mark Harris!
- Hey!

1:12:11.557 --> 1:12:15.460
So, we really enjoyed it and I
slid into his DMs on Instagram.

1:12:15.493 --> 1:12:18.064
I asked if he would write
and direct this, you know,

1:12:18.097 --> 1:12:20.132
TV show idea that we had,
and he agreed.

1:12:20.166 --> 1:12:22.101
- So, here we are.
- Yeah.

1:12:22.134 --> 1:12:25.638
Now, the funny thing is,
and I'm not gonna say any names,

1:12:25.671 --> 1:12:29.474
but we were actually pitching
this idea around Hollywood,

1:12:29.507 --> 1:12:31.944
and were in talks
with a major network.

1:12:31.978 --> 1:12:35.081
But, you know, we had to kind of
go a different direction

1:12:35.114 --> 1:12:39.484
because they were on some, like,
straight cooney-coon stuff.

1:12:39.517 --> 1:12:41.153
You know? They wanted Nora,

1:12:41.187 --> 1:12:43.623
you know, TV Nora, to be like...

1:12:43.656 --> 1:12:47.425
"Um, I don't wanna just be rich.
I want to be rich and famous.

1:12:47.459 --> 1:12:49.128
"I wanna kick it
with the Kardashians.

1:12:49.161 --> 1:12:51.030
"'Cause you know
I love me some Khloe.

1:12:51.063 --> 1:12:54.000
"Ooh, I definitely wanna hang
out with Jay Z and Beyonce.

1:12:54.033 --> 1:12:57.536
"Even if it is up in an elevator.
Okurrr!"

1:12:57.570 --> 1:13:01.807
"Ooh, I definitely finna smoke me
a fat one with Snoop Doggy Dogg."

1:13:01.841 --> 1:13:03.109
Yeah.

1:13:03.142 --> 1:13:06.045
See, they wanted us
to dance, set the jive.

1:13:06.078 --> 1:13:09.048
- You know, Hollywood shuffled it.
- Exactly. Yes.

1:13:09.081 --> 1:13:12.685
So, we decided to just go in a
different direction, do our own thing.

1:13:12.718 --> 1:13:15.755
And, yeah, we're actually
gonna make fun of them now.

1:13:15.788 --> 1:13:17.757
I mean, we're billionaires,

1:13:17.790 --> 1:13:19.692
and they wanted me
to stay single.

1:13:19.725 --> 1:13:21.627
You think... I don't think so.

1:13:21.661 --> 1:13:23.129
No, we actually got married.

1:13:23.162 --> 1:13:25.998
So, yes,
I'm Mrs. Nora Johnson now.

1:13:26.032 --> 1:13:27.867
Capital "M" on the Mrs.

1:13:27.900 --> 1:13:31.103
And, yeah, I would show you guys
my beautiful ring,

1:13:31.137 --> 1:13:34.941
but, uh, why am I not
showing my ring, sweetie?

1:13:34.974 --> 1:13:38.678
Because the order
hasn't come in yet.

1:13:38.711 --> 1:13:41.147
- I ordered a nice size...
- Oh!

1:13:41.180 --> 1:13:42.682
The nice size one. Right.

1:13:42.715 --> 1:13:44.482
Because, see,
what had happened was

1:13:44.516 --> 1:13:45.818
the original ring he ordered

1:13:45.851 --> 1:13:47.920
was something that
you see in, like, Walmart.

1:13:47.954 --> 1:13:49.655
Uh-uh, baby.
We are billionaires now.

1:13:49.689 --> 1:13:51.257
My ring needs
to reflect that, okay?

1:13:51.290 --> 1:13:52.425
So, I need you
to get it together.

1:13:52.457 --> 1:13:55.127
You know, we just got this
money, so I'm being safe.

1:13:55.161 --> 1:13:56.395
That's all. Just careful.

1:13:56.429 --> 1:13:59.598
Billionaires, and he being safe.
I need my ring, sweetie. Okay?

1:13:59.632 --> 1:14:01.600
Let's go 50 diamonds, boo.

1:14:07.006 --> 1:14:09.542
Me? I was excited, you know?

1:14:09.575 --> 1:14:11.711
Yeah. I was excited.

1:14:11.744 --> 1:14:14.080
I kind of knew
I was gonna win, though.

1:14:14.113 --> 1:14:15.715
I always...

1:14:15.748 --> 1:14:17.883
knew I was gonna do
something with my life.

1:14:17.917 --> 1:14:19.785
And I'm getting
much more sleep, too.

1:14:19.819 --> 1:14:22.121
For real. Less hustle now.

1:14:22.154 --> 1:14:23.889
- Yeah.
- Being out in no streets.

1:14:23.923 --> 1:14:25.992
I'll admit I had my doubts,

1:14:26.025 --> 1:14:27.460
but that was only because

1:14:27.492 --> 1:14:30.563
he would come home every other day
wanting to do something different.

1:14:30.596 --> 1:14:32.598
Like one day,
he wanted to be a fireman,

1:14:32.631 --> 1:14:34.166
then he wanted
to make doughnuts,

1:14:34.200 --> 1:14:36.635
then he wanted
to invest in Wall Street,

1:14:36.669 --> 1:14:38.904
or what was it? Work at Walmart?

1:14:38.938 --> 1:14:40.840
Or, hell, build Trump's wall.

1:14:40.873 --> 1:14:43.676
You remember that time you came
back from working at your brother's

1:14:43.709 --> 1:14:45.244
bummy-ass furniture store,

1:14:45.277 --> 1:14:47.113
and you want to be a cop?

1:14:47.980 --> 1:14:49.548
Yeah. Look, I kid you not.

1:14:49.582 --> 1:14:52.585
He comes home,
goes out and buys a toy gun,

1:14:52.618 --> 1:14:55.888
comes back and starts playing Cops and
Robbers with the little kids next door.

1:14:56.822 --> 1:14:57.990
You okay, baby?

1:14:58.024 --> 1:14:59.358
Oh, I'm fine.

1:14:59.392 --> 1:15:01.927
I'm just sitting here waiting
for you to parrot Tony Robbins'

1:15:01.961 --> 1:15:03.796
"Money is not
the key to happiness."

1:15:03.829 --> 1:15:05.798
Let me tell y'all something, okay?

1:15:05.831 --> 1:15:09.935
There is no evidence that says
poverty makes anyone happy.

1:15:09.969 --> 1:15:11.837
Now you see me? I'm happy.

1:15:11.871 --> 1:15:13.239
I've traveled the world,

1:15:13.272 --> 1:15:15.741
I've tasted
very exquisite cuisines,

1:15:15.775 --> 1:15:18.244
I frequently give
very charitable donations

1:15:18.277 --> 1:15:19.779
to a little homeless villages
in Europe.

1:15:19.812 --> 1:15:22.648
You know, with, like, the little
homeless white kids running around. Mm.

1:15:22.681 --> 1:15:25.584
Matter of fact, we were gonna adopt
what, like, five or seven of them,

1:15:25.618 --> 1:15:29.355
and then we found out that have our
own little bun in the oven coming.

1:15:29.388 --> 1:15:31.157
So, plans changed on that.

1:15:31.190 --> 1:15:32.658
But, um, yeah.

1:15:32.691 --> 1:15:35.795
I still do my part 'cause those white
women that do all that charity work

1:15:35.828 --> 1:15:37.963
definitely be
inspiring me, girl.

1:15:37.997 --> 1:15:41.934
We rich,
we rich, we white people rich.

1:15:41.967 --> 1:15:45.171
We rich, we rich,
we white people rich.

1:15:45.204 --> 1:15:46.305
Chauncey...
