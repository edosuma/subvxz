00:18.615 --> 00:19.335
Yeah?

00:19.336 --> 00:21.389
Detective Reagan?
It's Anna Zoltin.

00:21.390 --> 00:23.110
I don't know if you remember me.

00:23.957 --> 00:25.619
Yeah, of course I do. What is it?

00:25.620 --> 00:27.128
I'm sorry, I know it's late.

00:27.129 --> 00:29.007
I just... I didn't know
who else to turn to.

00:29.673 --> 00:30.887
What's wrong? Are you in trouble?

00:31.439 --> 00:32.357
I'm just scared.

00:32.769 --> 00:33.353
Okay.

00:34.737 --> 00:37.269
Anna, look, you're gonna
have to call 911, okay?

00:37.270 --> 00:39.032
Or just go down to the precinct,
and I'll be there soon.

00:40.006 --> 00:41.929
I don't even know
if you can help me.

00:41.930 --> 00:44.060
He said the cops can't help me.

00:44.594 --> 00:45.597
Well, who said that?

00:45.598 --> 00:46.876
Nobody can help me.

00:46.877 --> 00:48.358
I don't know why I called.

00:48.359 --> 00:49.728
Okay, Anna, A...

00:50.272 --> 00:51.358
Anna?

00:57.485 --> 00:59.341
You promised the
police chief of Belfast

00:59.342 --> 01:00.763
a tour of the Real
Time Crime Center

01:00.764 --> 01:02.235
before he leaves for
Ireland this evening.

01:02.236 --> 01:03.360
What else you got?

01:03.811 --> 01:08.034
Overnight, robbery on 169th
and Washington Avenue.

01:08.035 --> 01:09.634
Suspects armed with handguns.

01:09.635 --> 01:11.406
Fits the Manhattan
North robbery pattern.

01:11.407 --> 01:13.962
Harbor Unit's pulling out a
floater in Brooklyn as we speak,

01:13.963 --> 01:16.090
and a Detective
William Carter called.

01:16.091 --> 01:17.905
Old partner of mine.
What did he want?

01:17.906 --> 01:20.050
To tell you human
remains were recovered

01:20.051 --> 01:22.821
that may be connected to a case
you two worked 25 years ago.

01:25.273 --> 01:27.487
Tell my detail we're
heading back out.

01:28.339 --> 01:29.991
And your 0900 chiefs' briefing?

01:30.565 --> 01:31.226
Push it.

01:48.761 --> 01:50.765
Okay. Got it. Thanks. 10-4.

01:53.466 --> 01:55.901
M.E.'s still an
hour and a half out.

01:56.346 --> 01:57.368
Sad.

01:57.369 --> 01:58.536
Beautiful young girl.

01:59.213 --> 02:00.514
Still has makeup on, too.

02:00.515 --> 02:01.425
Must have just happened.

02:02.033 --> 02:03.311
Ours is not to speculate.

02:03.312 --> 02:05.064
We secure the scene,
and then we wait.

02:07.005 --> 02:08.344
Here comes the brain trust now.

02:08.934 --> 02:09.939
Just our luck.

02:09.940 --> 02:10.991
Sonny Malevsky.

02:12.784 --> 02:13.884
That's Sonny Malevsky?

02:14.051 --> 02:15.221
Yeah, why?

02:15.891 --> 02:16.894
Just...

02:18.430 --> 02:19.822
I think he used to work
with my brother Joe.

02:19.823 --> 02:20.918
Oh, yeah?

02:22.003 --> 02:23.026
Renzulli.

02:23.027 --> 02:23.867
Hey.

02:23.868 --> 02:26.021
Ah, you finally got your stripes.

02:26.022 --> 02:27.539
Mercy promotion?

02:27.540 --> 02:29.056
Don't bust my chops, all right?

02:29.057 --> 02:30.121
Who's the new fish?

02:31.315 --> 02:32.136
Reagan.

02:32.960 --> 02:34.613
So you're the PC's youngest.

02:35.890 --> 02:37.782
Is this your first floater, kid?

02:38.242 --> 02:40.220
Yeah. Well, looks fresh.

02:40.221 --> 02:42.142
You should see 'em after
a couple of weeks,

02:42.143 --> 02:44.402
after the fish and
the crabs get to 'em.

02:45.299 --> 02:46.521
Let's see what we got.

02:52.955 --> 02:54.155
Commissioner.

02:54.156 --> 02:56.323
Bill. As you were.

02:56.324 --> 02:58.012
Right over here.

02:59.779 --> 03:01.062
Looks like trauma to the skull.

03:01.504 --> 03:03.056
Could be Leo Gates.

03:03.057 --> 03:04.689
Clothes match the description.

03:04.690 --> 03:05.695
We got the backpack.

03:05.696 --> 03:08.879
Skeletal remains appear
to be those of a child.

03:09.311 --> 03:10.219
It's him.

03:10.672 --> 03:11.809
We don't know that yet, Frank.

03:12.006 --> 03:12.665
It's him.

03:15.657 --> 03:18.375
I don't even know if the mother
still lives around here anymore.

03:18.376 --> 03:19.953
She does.

03:19.954 --> 03:21.752
Nine-year-old boy.

03:24.546 --> 03:26.813
Have the M.E. make a positive I.D.

03:26.814 --> 03:29.195
before we start
opening up old wounds.

03:29.196 --> 03:32.071
It's no longer missing persons,
it's a homicide.

03:32.072 --> 03:35.048
I want the entire case
file on my desk forthwith.

03:35.049 --> 03:37.410
Keep this away from the
press as long as you can.

03:37.411 --> 03:39.455
I don't want the perp to
rabbit if he's still around.

03:39.456 --> 03:42.228
Sure. No problem, sir.

03:44.710 --> 03:46.507
Looks like you were
right all along, Frank.

03:46.508 --> 03:48.458
It gives me small comfort.

03:53.377 --> 03:55.612
So, kid, you probably
think she jumped

03:55.613 --> 03:57.547
from the Manhattan
bridge and floated down,

03:57.548 --> 03:58.916
but you would be wrong,

03:58.917 --> 04:01.612
because she would have hit the
East River at 65 miles an hour,

04:01.613 --> 04:03.386
and there's no contusions.

04:03.770 --> 04:07.191
That's not to say she
wouldn't have broken her neck,

04:07.192 --> 04:11.327
but it looks like
somebody did it for her.

04:11.930 --> 04:13.996
Let's see if there's
anything in these pockets.

04:22.566 --> 04:24.439
"Detective Daniel Reagan."

04:24.440 --> 04:28.210
Now, there is one for the
small world department.

04:28.211 --> 04:31.148
Renzulli, looks like this
one's gonna be a homicide.

04:31.149 --> 04:32.547
Hey, kid,

04:32.548 --> 04:34.216
maybe you want to
call your brother.

04:34.217 --> 04:35.851
He might want to come down here

04:35.852 --> 04:38.053
and finish what he
seems to have started.

04:59.245 --> 05:01.545
So did you call back
this Anna Zoltin?

05:01.546 --> 05:02.580
I couldn't call her back, okay?

05:02.581 --> 05:03.814
She called from a blocked number.

05:03.815 --> 05:05.650
All right, so what were
you supposed to do?

05:05.651 --> 05:07.184
You're supposed to drive
around all five boroughs

05:07.185 --> 05:08.586
in the middle of the night,
looking for this girl?

05:08.587 --> 05:09.720
She didn't tell you where she was.

05:09.721 --> 05:11.553
I know, I know.
I just feel bad, okay?

05:11.554 --> 05:13.052
Girl was getting her
life back together,

05:13.053 --> 05:13.758
and this happens?

05:14.252 --> 05:15.092
I know.

05:15.093 --> 05:16.959
How'd you know her, anyway?

05:16.960 --> 05:18.328
A Vice sting about a year ago.

05:18.329 --> 05:20.263
A bunch of call girls,
half a dozen johns.

05:20.733 --> 05:21.831
High-end operation.

05:21.832 --> 05:24.300
I'm sure it was a
very classy situation.

05:24.301 --> 05:27.135
She was an escort, okay? I'm
not gonna make excuses for her.

05:27.136 --> 05:29.252
But she lost her little girl;
She was trying to get her back.

05:29.253 --> 05:30.355
She did what she had to do.

05:30.356 --> 05:31.707
Spoke to the ADA,
got her sentence reduced

05:31.708 --> 05:33.244
to mandatory rehab.

05:33.727 --> 05:35.275
She was a good kid, Jackie.

05:35.276 --> 05:36.802
I'm sure she was.

05:36.803 --> 05:37.902
It's nice.

05:37.903 --> 05:39.487
And unlike the guys I put away.

05:39.488 --> 05:41.640
They're too busy throwing
darts at my picture

05:41.641 --> 05:43.263
in the middle of the
night to ask me for help.

05:43.264 --> 05:45.673
Yeah, well, this girl needed help;
now she's dead.

05:45.674 --> 05:47.421
Well, listen,
here's what we're gonna do.

05:47.422 --> 05:48.795
We're gonna figure
out who did this,

05:48.796 --> 05:51.362
and we're gonna string him
up by his family jewels.

05:51.363 --> 05:52.752
It's not gonna bring her back,

05:52.753 --> 05:53.920
but it's gonna make
you feel better.

05:56.006 --> 05:57.597
Your afternoon schedule, sir.

05:58.563 --> 05:59.433
Bronx Borough President's

05:59.434 --> 06:01.635
Man of the Year Luncheon at 1300,

06:01.636 --> 06:03.382
followed by Queens
Community Board meeting

06:03.383 --> 06:04.580
in Jackson Heights.

06:04.581 --> 06:06.279
Police Foundation honors the Mayor

06:06.280 --> 06:08.915
at a cocktail reception
1700 to 1830 hours.

06:08.916 --> 06:11.311
I've marked these
DD-5s for reinterview.

06:11.312 --> 06:13.646
See that Detective
Carter gets back to me

06:13.647 --> 06:16.148
with the new fives as
soon as he does them.

06:17.740 --> 06:18.680
Yes, sir.

06:19.686 --> 06:23.622
This is a letter of condolence
written to the mother.

06:24.853 --> 06:26.305
"Dear Mrs. Gates,

06:26.306 --> 06:29.042
"I am very sorry that
your son has disappeared.

06:29.043 --> 06:31.085
"I know how terrible
you must feel.

06:32.263 --> 06:33.747
I am sorry for that."

06:35.765 --> 06:36.877
It's not signed.

06:36.878 --> 06:39.027
Was it written by
a man or a woman?

06:40.399 --> 06:41.506
I'd say a man, sir.

06:51.431 --> 06:52.377
Sir...

06:52.378 --> 06:54.007
the autopsy's in.

06:54.629 --> 06:56.983
Leo Gates's dental
records are a match.

07:01.914 --> 07:03.046
Thank you, Baker.

07:04.941 --> 07:07.485
Cancel the rest of my schedule.

07:16.128 --> 07:17.995
- Okay, thanks.
- Right here, look at this.

07:17.996 --> 07:19.633
Nonpareil Escorts.

07:19.634 --> 07:20.984
That's the place Anna was working

07:20.985 --> 07:22.017
when I busted her a year ago.

07:22.018 --> 07:24.901
Vice has had the place padlocked
down for four months now.

07:24.902 --> 07:26.476
Well, I got something over here.

07:26.477 --> 07:28.720
The receptionist at
Anna's accounting firm

07:28.721 --> 07:31.455
said that some guy used to
send her roses all the time.

07:31.456 --> 07:33.293
Getting pretty heavy.
She didn't like it.

07:33.294 --> 07:34.430
She put a restraining
order against him.

07:34.431 --> 07:36.484
Receptionist didn't
have the guy's name,

07:36.485 --> 07:38.850
but I got in touch with
the florist who did.

07:38.851 --> 07:39.887
- And you got it?
- Yes.

07:39.888 --> 07:41.424
Guy's name is Richard Hansen.

07:41.903 --> 07:43.202
He's an attorney.

07:43.203 --> 07:45.009
No priors. Madison Avenue address.

07:45.010 --> 07:45.954
And he's on the Board of

07:45.955 --> 07:48.189
- the East Side Parks Conservancy.
- Fantastic.

07:48.190 --> 07:50.027
Let's go see if we can't
persuade Mr. Hansen

07:50.028 --> 07:52.226
to come on down here and
let us pick his brain

07:52.227 --> 07:54.612
about why the Green Thumb keeps
sending our victim flowers.

07:54.613 --> 07:55.268
Good.

08:22.864 --> 08:24.123
Commissioner Reagan.

08:24.124 --> 08:25.082
Mrs. Gates.

08:30.776 --> 08:32.025
You found Leo.

08:33.363 --> 08:34.246
We did.

08:38.259 --> 08:39.567
Where did you find him?

08:41.681 --> 08:43.773
In the old building
next to the post office,

08:43.774 --> 08:45.314
two blocks from school.

08:45.891 --> 08:46.752
So, he...

08:49.820 --> 08:52.508
...he was so close
all those years.

08:53.879 --> 08:54.646
There was, uh...

08:55.303 --> 08:58.245
a false wall in the basement.

09:02.420 --> 09:04.039
Did he suffer?

09:05.338 --> 09:08.743
The medical examiner
determined the cause of death

09:08.744 --> 09:10.879
to be blunt force
trauma to the head.

09:11.574 --> 09:14.590
It was, most likely,
instantaneous.

09:16.342 --> 09:18.126
Well, I guess that's something.

09:22.115 --> 09:23.626
That building...

09:24.656 --> 09:28.151
Does it have any meaning for you?

09:28.152 --> 09:29.716
Friends there? People you knew?

09:29.717 --> 09:31.830
We passed it on the way to school.

09:36.159 --> 09:37.713
Every day, I walked with him.

09:39.957 --> 09:41.687
But he'd been begging me for weeks

09:42.052 --> 09:44.357
to let him walk home by himself.

09:47.265 --> 09:48.791
It was raining that day.

09:52.318 --> 09:54.752
I keep asking myself,
is that the reason

09:54.753 --> 09:56.387
I didn't go and get him,

09:56.388 --> 09:57.921
because it was raining?

09:58.226 --> 09:59.589
Laura...

10:01.237 --> 10:02.392
There are some things

10:02.393 --> 10:05.293
none of us can ever
completely control.

10:06.005 --> 10:08.729
And one of them is
protecting our kids

10:08.730 --> 10:10.107
every moment of the day.

10:10.814 --> 10:12.583
I just think...

10:14.037 --> 10:17.026
You know, if only
I'd been with him...

10:17.507 --> 10:20.742
If only I'd made sure he
walked with a friend...

10:29.089 --> 10:31.556
I guess I should call Father John.

10:34.193 --> 10:36.428
We can have a funeral now.

10:42.067 --> 10:43.702
Thank you, Frank.

10:44.623 --> 10:47.160
There's no need to thank me...

10:47.972 --> 10:50.675
until I bring Leo's
killer to justice.

10:58.149 --> 10:59.950
You threatened to come to my home?

10:59.951 --> 11:01.448
It was either your
home or your office.

11:01.449 --> 11:02.705
I didn't kill Anna Zoltin.

11:02.706 --> 11:04.052
No, she killed herself.

11:04.053 --> 11:04.905
She took her own hands

11:04.906 --> 11:07.164
and strangled herself right before
dumping her body in the river.

11:07.165 --> 11:09.452
Where were you the night
Anna Zoltin was killed?

11:09.453 --> 11:11.281
At a charity fund-raiser
for my kid's school.

11:11.282 --> 11:12.848
Oh, regular father
of the year, huh?

11:12.849 --> 11:15.428
Anna Zoltin took out an order
of protection against you

11:15.429 --> 11:16.839
the night before she was murdered.

11:16.840 --> 11:18.623
Wonder why she did that.
What'd she do...

11:18.624 --> 11:20.191
threaten to tell your wife?
Is that why you killed her?

11:20.192 --> 11:22.160
Why would I throw away
my life for a whore?

11:22.161 --> 11:23.982
Hey, that whore was
somebody's daughter

11:23.983 --> 11:25.650
and she was also
somebody's mother.

11:25.651 --> 11:27.618
But she wanted to quit and you
wouldn't let her, would you?

11:27.619 --> 11:28.949
You wanted to keep
having sex with her,

11:28.950 --> 11:29.791
but you wouldn't let her say no.

11:29.792 --> 11:31.755
I can afford any woman I want.

11:31.756 --> 11:32.411
Really?

11:32.412 --> 11:34.328
How about we call
Mrs. Hansen down here

11:34.329 --> 11:35.875
and see how she feels about that?

11:40.299 --> 11:41.505
Okay.

11:48.484 --> 11:50.465
I was a regular client of Anna's.

11:51.967 --> 11:55.569
When she told me she quit,
I tried using other call girls,

11:55.570 --> 11:58.805
but she was really special.

11:59.186 --> 12:00.110
You know what I mean?

12:00.111 --> 12:01.275
Not firsthand.

12:01.276 --> 12:02.400
But keep talking.

12:03.037 --> 12:05.105
I offered to pay her
rent plus double

12:05.106 --> 12:07.231
what she made as an escort,
but she turned me down.

12:07.749 --> 12:10.971
The flowers were my attempt
to change her mind.

12:10.972 --> 12:12.743
- And did it help?
- No.

12:15.045 --> 12:17.891
But, look, I wasn't the only one
who thought she was special.

12:18.210 --> 12:20.472
I heard from other girls
in the escort agency

12:20.473 --> 12:24.293
tha-that her boss was
always hitting on her.

12:25.022 --> 12:26.201
You have a name for us?

12:26.202 --> 12:28.607
The only thing I know is
that his first name is John.

12:28.608 --> 12:31.030
- Well, there's a start.
- Yeah.

12:31.031 --> 12:33.505
You'd better pray
your alibi checks out.

12:35.344 --> 12:38.525
I just wanted to drop these
DD-5s off for the commissioner.

12:38.526 --> 12:40.695
Well, the commissioner
is not home yet.

12:40.696 --> 12:42.164
I know that, sir.

12:45.453 --> 12:47.428
I'm retired. You don't
have to call me sir.

12:48.344 --> 12:49.507
What should I call you?

12:49.508 --> 12:50.605
Henry.

12:53.210 --> 12:55.644
Something on your mind, Ms. Baker?

12:55.994 --> 12:58.780
It's a cold case of his,
involving a child.

12:58.781 --> 13:00.949
It's consumed him.

13:02.818 --> 13:05.720
We all have these cases.

13:05.721 --> 13:08.423
I had one back in '55...
the remains

13:08.424 --> 13:12.403
of a kid in a duffel
bag off the FDR.

13:12.404 --> 13:14.828
I still take the case
out every now and then.

13:14.829 --> 13:16.957
It's always bad when
it's children, but...

13:19.100 --> 13:23.190
if I may say, sir,
he's in a very dark place.

13:23.995 --> 13:27.629
He and the detective who was in
charge of the case were at odds.

13:28.409 --> 13:30.177
There was a witness who said

13:30.178 --> 13:32.679
he thought he saw the
kid get into a car,

13:32.680 --> 13:35.605
but Francis wasn't
having any of it.

13:35.606 --> 13:38.618
He was convinced the kid
never left the block;

13:38.619 --> 13:40.373
that he was murdered.

13:42.874 --> 13:46.401
He'll find the forensic
anthropologist's report there as well.

13:47.064 --> 13:49.122
Blunt force trauma to
the skull was caused

13:49.123 --> 13:51.960
by the round striking
end of a hammer.

13:54.368 --> 13:57.882
His own kids were
that age back then.

13:58.555 --> 14:00.723
It tore him up.

14:02.926 --> 14:06.629
It's the losses that
keep you up at night.

14:09.933 --> 14:11.243
How'd your anniversary go?

14:11.244 --> 14:12.215
It was good.

14:12.216 --> 14:14.082
I got my wife a snow globe.

14:15.504 --> 14:16.571
I know it's, uh,

14:16.572 --> 14:18.740
too lowbrow for
your Harvard tastes,

14:18.741 --> 14:20.396
but my wife loves snow globes.

14:20.397 --> 14:22.234
Fake snow... I get the appeal.

14:22.235 --> 14:23.040
You get the appeal?

14:23.414 --> 14:24.042
Yeah.

14:26.235 --> 14:28.203
Tell me how you
know Sonny Malevsky.

14:28.719 --> 14:30.899
Why are you so interested
in that putz, huh?

14:31.818 --> 14:33.006
I'm just curious.

14:33.007 --> 14:34.441
Well, some guys become cops

14:34.442 --> 14:36.509
because they love law enforcement,

14:36.510 --> 14:38.045
some guys for job security,

14:38.046 --> 14:40.147
some guys because they
don't know what else to do.

14:41.036 --> 14:43.034
And then you got
guys like Malevsky

14:43.494 --> 14:45.473
who's just on a big power trip.

14:46.176 --> 14:48.087
Anything more than that?

14:48.088 --> 14:49.421
What, like, corruption?

14:50.970 --> 14:52.759
That's a big word.

14:52.760 --> 14:55.261
Let's just say I think
that he's someone...

14:55.262 --> 14:57.263
when you're talking to him,

14:57.264 --> 14:59.899
you better have one
hand on your wallet.

15:00.275 --> 15:01.800
Know what I mean?

15:08.647 --> 15:10.408
Hey.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.543
You still up, Pop?

15:12.544 --> 15:13.678
Your aide dropped off

15:13.679 --> 15:15.747
some fives for the Gates case.

15:16.251 --> 15:17.948
They smell of the precinct.

15:17.949 --> 15:19.750
I hope you don't mind.

15:19.751 --> 15:22.419
It's the losses that
keep you up at night.

15:33.531 --> 15:35.732
You miss it, don't you?

15:38.022 --> 15:39.503
I do.

15:39.504 --> 15:41.470
Wasn't done being a cop.

15:42.086 --> 15:43.839
You did what you had to do.

15:44.422 --> 15:45.741
Same as you.

15:45.742 --> 15:48.644
No, I wanted the job.

15:50.525 --> 15:53.549
You should feel proud, Francis.

15:53.550 --> 15:56.244
You're the only chief the rank
and file would have accepted

15:56.245 --> 15:58.953
after that last bum
of the mayor's.

15:59.157 --> 16:01.756
The time had come
and you stepped up.

16:01.757 --> 16:03.825
Here.

16:03.826 --> 16:04.826
Take these.

16:04.827 --> 16:06.361
They're yours.

16:08.649 --> 16:10.365
What are you looking for?

16:10.366 --> 16:11.999
I don't know.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.134
Something to jog my memory.

16:14.135 --> 16:15.703
What is it you always said, Pop...

16:15.704 --> 16:18.539
There's a lot in a detective's
head that isn't written down.

16:18.540 --> 16:21.875
But you've got a photographic
mind for this stuff.

16:21.876 --> 16:23.677
Yeah?

16:23.678 --> 16:26.246
Well, there's something
I can't remember

16:26.247 --> 16:30.249
or overlooked or didn't consider.

16:36.439 --> 16:38.391
Night, Francis.

16:38.392 --> 16:40.593
Night, Pop.

16:58.990 --> 17:00.291
Yeah, yeah, thanks.

17:00.292 --> 17:01.692
Anything yet?

17:01.693 --> 17:03.627
Hansen's alibi checks out.

17:03.628 --> 17:05.262
What?

17:05.262 --> 17:06.496
You know, it's guys like that

17:06.497 --> 17:08.165
that make me want to stay single.

17:08.165 --> 17:10.134
Yeah, well, he told the truth.

17:10.135 --> 17:11.401
Maybe he's telling the truth

17:11.402 --> 17:14.337
about this John guy
who owned the agency.

17:14.338 --> 17:15.939
Says he was obsessed with Anna.

17:15.940 --> 17:17.406
Well, let's see;
let's check it out.

17:17.407 --> 17:18.407
Black Book.

17:20.188 --> 17:20.911
Yeah, well,

17:20.912 --> 17:22.813
the escort service
was owned by a John.

17:22.814 --> 17:23.814
John Vega.

17:23.815 --> 17:26.016
Huh, what's he up to now?

17:26.817 --> 17:28.450
Owns a business called

17:28.451 --> 17:30.586
Executive Clientele.

17:31.721 --> 17:33.555
Well, look at that. Oh, well.

17:33.556 --> 17:35.591
It's not hard to tell what
John's new business is doing.

17:35.592 --> 17:37.126
No.

17:40.030 --> 17:42.798
You're listed as the
company owner, Mr. Vega.

17:42.799 --> 17:45.033
Hey, hey, just call me Johnny.

17:45.034 --> 17:46.034
Johnny the Pimp?

17:47.236 --> 17:49.938
Our ladies do not engage
in sexual intercourse.

17:49.939 --> 17:52.140
Right, your clients
just pay $1,000 a pop

17:52.141 --> 17:53.175
for stimulating conversation.

17:53.176 --> 17:54.176
Is that it?

17:54.177 --> 17:56.711
Our clients are out-
of-town businessmen

17:56.712 --> 17:59.213
or Europeans who just
want beautiful ladies

17:59.214 --> 18:00.514
to show them around the city,

18:00.515 --> 18:03.017
you know, business dinners
with 'em and stuff.

18:03.018 --> 18:04.952
Yeah, you know Anna Zoltin?

18:05.710 --> 18:07.388
Yeah, I think she used to
work for my accountant.

18:07.389 --> 18:08.622
Really? Well, they told us

18:08.623 --> 18:10.491
that she delivered
many packages here.

18:10.492 --> 18:12.311
No, no, tha-that's not true.

18:12.312 --> 18:13.787
How about the fact that
she was as an escort

18:13.788 --> 18:15.262
at Nonpareil while
you were running it?

18:16.200 --> 18:17.931
I... I don't recall.

18:17.932 --> 18:20.100
You recall where you
were two nights ago?

18:20.101 --> 18:22.369
Hillary, pull up Jolene, will you?

18:22.370 --> 18:24.504
I was at her place all night.

18:26.030 --> 18:28.742
Well, we're going to need her
contact information to corroborate.

18:28.743 --> 18:30.777
Sure, I'll make sure you
get that before you leave.

18:30.778 --> 18:33.113
And, hey, you ever want to
try any of our services,

18:33.114 --> 18:35.448
I'll make sure you get
the NYPD discount.

18:35.449 --> 18:37.065
No, thanks. I'm married.

18:37.066 --> 18:38.079
That's too bad.

18:38.080 --> 18:38.985
You don't know what
you're missing.

18:38.986 --> 18:40.615
Neither do you.

18:43.124 --> 18:45.892
250 interviews of people in the
building across the street,

18:45.893 --> 18:48.393
and not one of them saw
Leo enter that building,

18:48.394 --> 18:49.977
never mind with anyone.

18:51.397 --> 18:52.757
What do you think, sir?

18:53.867 --> 18:55.735
I don't know.

18:55.736 --> 18:58.604
Had to be someone in that
building on that day;

18:58.605 --> 19:00.850
someone that wouldn't
raise suspicions.

19:02.775 --> 19:06.578
If it moves, you duct tape it;
if it squeaks, you WD-40 it;

19:06.579 --> 19:09.137
if it's stuck,
you hit it with a hammer.

19:10.549 --> 19:12.417
Sounds about right, sir.

19:12.418 --> 19:14.702
Get me Bill Carter on the phone.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.556
Jolene DeMaine.

19:18.557 --> 19:19.656
Detective Reagan.

19:19.657 --> 19:20.958
This is my partner
Detective Curatola.

19:20.959 --> 19:23.233
Johnny told me that
you'd be looking for me.

19:23.234 --> 19:24.095
Oh, did he? Yeah.

19:24.096 --> 19:26.130
He was with me that night.
Really, doing what?

19:26.131 --> 19:28.365
Dinner, and then we
hung out all night.

19:28.366 --> 19:30.167
- Where?
- Where?

19:30.640 --> 19:31.869
My place.

19:31.870 --> 19:33.771
Look, I'm sorry,
I really need to go.

19:33.772 --> 19:34.838
- I'm late.
- Hey, you know what?

19:34.839 --> 19:36.372
If you think of anything,

19:36.373 --> 19:38.541
why don't you give
us a call, okay?

19:38.794 --> 19:39.987
I won't.

19:42.880 --> 19:44.914
- That went well.
- Yeah.

19:44.915 --> 19:47.516
Hold for the commissioner.

19:47.517 --> 19:49.585
Where are you with the
new interviews, Bill?

19:49.586 --> 19:52.587
Um, I've located
some of them, sir.

19:52.588 --> 19:56.125
In fact, right now, I'm with
the witness Todd Connelly.

19:56.126 --> 19:57.692
He's not on my list.

19:57.693 --> 19:58.861
No, I know, but it just...

19:58.862 --> 20:01.163
it occurred to me
that he may have said

20:01.164 --> 20:03.832
that he saw Leo Gates
entering the Corolla

20:04.150 --> 20:06.068
to throw the investigation.

20:06.069 --> 20:08.469
The murderer put him up to it.

20:08.470 --> 20:10.004
What about Ted Wessel?

20:10.348 --> 20:10.939
Wessel?

20:10.940 --> 20:12.607
The superintendent of the building

20:12.608 --> 20:15.227
where Leo Gates' bones were found,
a re-interview

20:15.228 --> 20:16.845
I specifically requested.

20:16.846 --> 20:18.847
Yeah, I haven't
found him yet, sir.

20:18.848 --> 20:20.481
Find him.

20:20.482 --> 20:22.419
Do it quick and do it right

20:22.420 --> 20:24.722
or you'll be walking a
beat so far out in Queens,

20:24.723 --> 20:27.022
you'll need a passport
to get back to Manhattan.

20:27.510 --> 20:28.442
Yes, sir.

20:29.961 --> 20:31.666
Find out everything
there is to know

20:31.667 --> 20:33.357
about Theodore Wessel...

20:33.358 --> 20:36.454
Every detail of his life
from the day he was born.

20:43.992 --> 20:46.940
Hey, okay, so Johnny Vega
has a criminal history...

20:46.941 --> 20:50.411
assault, extortion, gambling,
promoting prostitution.

20:50.412 --> 20:52.178
So what is he doing
still on the street?

20:52.179 --> 20:54.751
Well, this is his first
go-round with murder, though.

20:54.752 --> 20:56.062
He's got an alibi for that.

20:56.063 --> 20:58.807
We can't even get enough to
subpoena his phone records.

20:58.808 --> 21:01.195
All right, so there's
got to be something.

21:01.196 --> 21:02.975
Besides Nonpareil,
is there any way

21:02.976 --> 21:04.239
we can connect this guy to Anna?

21:04.240 --> 21:06.895
I've been through her phone
records, her e-mails.

21:06.896 --> 21:08.694
There is absolutely
nothing from Vega,

21:08.695 --> 21:10.887
but there are tons of phone calls

21:10.888 --> 21:13.924
back and forth from Anna
Zoltin and Jolene DeMaine

21:13.925 --> 21:16.511
nearly every day, including
the night she was killed,

21:16.512 --> 21:18.110
right after she called you.

21:18.111 --> 21:19.193
Jolene DeMaine?

21:19.194 --> 21:19.840
Mm-hmm.

21:19.841 --> 21:22.107
Sounds like she knows something
she's not letting on.

21:22.108 --> 21:23.241
Mm-hmm.

21:24.477 --> 21:25.777
You got a second to talk?

21:26.393 --> 21:27.594
I already talked to you.

21:27.595 --> 21:28.790
Yeah, but you never told us

21:28.791 --> 21:29.847
that you and Anna were friends.

21:30.483 --> 21:32.583
We know you spoke to Anna
the night she was killed,

21:33.188 --> 21:34.518
'cause I did, too.

21:35.676 --> 21:36.334
She sounded afraid

21:36.335 --> 21:38.498
that someone was going to find
out she reached out to me.

21:38.980 --> 21:41.143
I'm thinking it was Johnny
Vega she was afraid of.

21:41.144 --> 21:42.677
But you told us

21:42.678 --> 21:44.574
that you were with him the
night Anna was killed.

21:44.575 --> 21:45.830
I did see him that night.

21:45.831 --> 21:47.319
Just not the whole night.

21:48.174 --> 21:49.479
Look, I can't help you.

21:49.480 --> 21:50.955
Come on, you're going
to let this guy get away

21:50.956 --> 21:51.910
with killing your friend?

21:52.431 --> 21:54.511
You know he strangled her so hard

21:54.512 --> 21:56.595
that he broke a bone in her neck.

21:56.596 --> 21:58.537
- Don't.
- Well, then, tell us the truth.

21:58.538 --> 22:01.575
You have no idea what
Johnny's really like.

22:01.576 --> 22:02.856
So you give him an alibi?

22:02.857 --> 22:04.876
- I can end up like her.
- You can also end up

22:04.877 --> 22:06.752
in prison for
hindering prosecution.

22:08.018 --> 22:09.732
Jolene, tell us what happened.

22:11.968 --> 22:14.057
Johnny had a thing for her.

22:14.058 --> 22:16.625
He was always creeping on her.

22:16.665 --> 22:18.290
And finally, she started saying

22:18.291 --> 22:21.092
that she'd go to the cops if
he didn't stop harassing her.

22:21.471 --> 22:23.195
She told me about you.

22:23.196 --> 22:24.736
She said that we could trust you.

22:24.737 --> 22:25.756
You can.

22:25.757 --> 22:27.371
Keep talking.

22:28.604 --> 22:29.837
Anna told me

22:29.838 --> 22:31.726
that she dropped off the
checks at Executive.

22:32.311 --> 22:34.179
When she got there,
Johnny tried to jump her,

22:34.180 --> 22:35.036
but she fought him off,

22:35.037 --> 22:36.696
and she told him that that was it,

22:36.697 --> 22:38.866
that she was going
to go to the cops.

22:39.766 --> 22:40.957
She ran out of there.

22:41.526 --> 22:43.055
And she called me from her cell.

22:43.056 --> 22:43.998
She was petrified

22:43.999 --> 22:45.559
that he was coming after her.

22:45.560 --> 22:47.973
So I told her that I'd
meet her at her place.

22:47.974 --> 22:49.325
What time was that?

22:49.819 --> 22:51.126
It was around midnight.

22:52.044 --> 22:54.464
When I got there,
she was so scared,

22:54.465 --> 22:55.462
her hands were shaking.

22:55.975 --> 22:58.342
She told me she was going
to meet you at the precinct.

22:58.699 --> 23:00.344
And I said that I
would wait with her.

23:00.631 --> 23:01.606
Did you?

23:05.077 --> 23:07.245
There was a knock on the door.

23:07.246 --> 23:09.325
And Anna told me to hide
while she answered it,

23:09.326 --> 23:11.316
so I ducked into her bedroom.

23:11.852 --> 23:13.819
And it was Johnny Vega.

23:13.820 --> 23:15.510
He was furious.

23:15.788 --> 23:19.024
They had words,
then I didn't hear anything,

23:19.025 --> 23:21.726
so I peeked out to make
sure that she was okay,

23:22.880 --> 23:23.995
and I saw...

23:24.830 --> 23:27.499
...and I saw him strangle her.

23:28.064 --> 23:29.105
Did he see you?

23:29.106 --> 23:30.368
No. No.

23:30.369 --> 23:31.712
God, I didn't move.

23:31.713 --> 23:35.117
I waited until he left...
with Anna.

23:36.386 --> 23:39.646
And the next day,
when Anna's body showed up,

23:39.647 --> 23:44.589
he said that that's what happens
when people talk to cops.

23:50.700 --> 23:52.823
Let's go scoop this
piece of garbage.

24:03.799 --> 24:04.966
Johnny Vega!

24:05.415 --> 24:06.500
Get your hands out
of your pockets.

24:06.501 --> 24:07.448
Keep 'em where I can see them.

24:07.449 --> 24:10.149
You come to take me up
on that NYPD discount?

24:10.150 --> 24:12.055
I don't have anything
for the young lady,

24:12.056 --> 24:13.490
unless she goes that way.

24:14.221 --> 24:16.693
We're here to arrest you for
the murder of Anna Zoltin.

24:17.510 --> 24:18.842
You know what? Whatever.

24:18.843 --> 24:20.793
Great. Turn around.

24:21.725 --> 24:23.422
Turn your ass around.

24:24.484 --> 24:26.485
You have the right
to remain silent.

24:26.486 --> 24:28.957
Anything you say may be used
against you in a court of law.

24:28.958 --> 24:30.774
You have the right to
consult with an attorney.

24:31.349 --> 24:31.895
You have the right

24:31.896 --> 24:33.954
to have the attorney
present during questioning.

24:33.955 --> 24:35.290
You can't afford an attorney,

24:35.291 --> 24:38.141
one will be appointed
to you at no cost.

24:39.298 --> 24:42.328
That Johnny Vega is
one cool cucumber.

24:42.329 --> 24:43.712
As long as he's held without bail

24:43.713 --> 24:45.072
for second degree murder,
I don't care.

24:45.073 --> 24:47.114
Detective Reagan. Curatola.

24:48.288 --> 24:49.608
Special Agent Stuart LeMarque.

24:50.115 --> 24:51.186
Oh, FBI.

24:51.187 --> 24:52.443
To what do we owe the pleasure?

24:52.444 --> 24:54.651
- You arrested John Vega today.
- Yeah.

24:54.652 --> 24:56.084
Creates a little bit
of a problem for us.

24:56.085 --> 24:57.261
Really? Why is that?

24:57.262 --> 24:59.510
He's instrumental in a
RICO case we got going.

24:59.511 --> 25:01.221
Well, he's a
confidential informant.

25:01.222 --> 25:03.820
Oh, makes sense now,
why he has all those

25:03.821 --> 25:06.076
get-out-of-jail-free
cards on felony collars.

25:06.077 --> 25:08.508
This guy's a made member of
the Rulanti crime family.

25:08.509 --> 25:10.546
He's a like a son
to Tommy Rulanti.

25:10.547 --> 25:11.949
Well, I don't care if he's
like a son to the pope.

25:11.950 --> 25:13.692
He's not getting a pass from us,
so forget it.

25:13.693 --> 25:17.091
Our case hinges on Vega's
cooperation, all right?

25:17.092 --> 25:18.102
We're going after the
bigger fish here.

25:18.103 --> 25:20.209
As opposed to the
little homicide here.

25:20.210 --> 25:22.313
I need you to understand
that we have an opportunity

25:22.314 --> 25:24.677
to deal the Rulanti crime
family a crippling blow.

25:24.678 --> 25:26.658
And we have an opportunity
to lock this punk up

25:26.659 --> 25:28.369
for second degree murder,
and we will.

25:28.722 --> 25:32.171
You really think the FBI is
gonna let some NYPD detective

25:32.172 --> 25:34.544
blow a multimillion
dollar RICO case?

25:36.847 --> 25:37.816
Maybe.

25:39.491 --> 25:40.634
Putz.

25:41.092 --> 25:43.793
He's having trouble
playing with others again?

25:43.794 --> 25:46.014
FBI trying to tell me who
we can and can't arrest.

25:46.015 --> 25:48.456
Well, if it's about Johnny Vega,
we have other problems.

25:48.457 --> 25:49.963
What, are they trying to
lean on you to dismiss?

25:49.964 --> 25:52.288
No, his defense team has requested

25:52.289 --> 25:53.888
our eyewitness's statement.

25:53.889 --> 25:55.067
Are you kidding me?

25:55.068 --> 25:57.074
Then Johnny's gonna know
it was Jolene DeMaine.

25:57.075 --> 25:59.938
Oh, it is a death
sentence for her.

25:59.939 --> 26:01.127
It's within the law, Danny.

26:05.164 --> 26:06.689
I'm just saying,
what kind of law is it?

26:06.690 --> 26:09.213
It's the kind that
guarantees a fair trial.

26:09.586 --> 26:11.444
Fair trial. I got a witness

26:11.445 --> 26:13.392
who risks her life to come and
give you recorded testimony;

26:13.393 --> 26:15.591
you turn around and give it
to the murderer. Is that fair?

26:15.592 --> 26:16.892
Well, the judge hasn't
ruled on it yet, Danny.

26:16.893 --> 26:19.114
And that's why cops hate Mondays.

26:19.115 --> 26:19.900
Excuse me.

26:21.340 --> 26:23.079
Well, it doesn't seem right, Mom.

26:23.080 --> 26:23.895
It's not right.

26:25.928 --> 26:28.338
The defender has the right
to know who's accusing him.

26:28.339 --> 26:30.415
That's so they can figure
out who to intimidate.

26:31.064 --> 26:34.130
Without discovery statutes,
it's not a level playing field.

26:34.543 --> 26:37.190
We're talking about playing
with people's lives here.

26:37.191 --> 26:38.104
Well, Nick, would you really want

26:38.105 --> 26:39.772
a world where anyone could
have someone locked up,

26:39.773 --> 26:41.274
just on their anonymous say-so?

26:41.275 --> 26:42.642
That doesn't sound so good,
either.

26:42.643 --> 26:44.043
Thank you, Jamie.

26:44.044 --> 26:46.286
Except in this case, you know
it's an intimidation tactic.

26:46.287 --> 26:47.161
Wrecks your only case.

26:47.162 --> 26:48.483
- See what I mean?
- No.

26:48.484 --> 26:50.032
Un-thank you, Jamie.

26:50.033 --> 26:50.973
The bottom line is,

26:50.974 --> 26:53.528
all the FBI cares about is
making their splashy case

26:53.529 --> 26:55.904
against the Rulanti crime family.

26:55.905 --> 26:58.179
And meanwhile, Anna Zoltin
just floats right down

26:58.180 --> 26:59.407
the East River into oblivion,

26:59.408 --> 27:00.836
and no one even
arrests the murderer.

27:00.837 --> 27:02.336
Yeah, what did you
say they said, Danny?

27:02.337 --> 27:03.503
"Come on, she's just a call girl""

27:03.504 --> 27:05.372
Oh, pretty much.
"Just a call girl""

27:05.373 --> 27:06.540
What's a call girl?

27:06.541 --> 27:08.175
I don't know.

27:08.176 --> 27:09.609
Uh, a...

27:09.610 --> 27:12.379
That is a girl who
talks on her cell

27:12.380 --> 27:14.315
- all the time.
- So...

27:14.316 --> 27:15.649
kind of like Aunt Erin?

27:16.852 --> 27:18.117
Sorry.

27:20.071 --> 27:21.171
Yeah.

27:22.441 --> 27:23.227
No.

27:23.228 --> 27:24.251
Sorry.

27:25.912 --> 27:27.112
Anything?

27:27.113 --> 27:28.379
Dead end.

27:28.380 --> 27:30.248
Ah. What was so funny?

27:30.249 --> 27:31.469
Oh, a barrel of
laughs in here, Dad.

27:31.470 --> 27:33.945
Between the FBI and the DA's
office trying to kill my witness.

27:33.946 --> 27:35.494
Oh, enough with the drama.

27:35.495 --> 27:38.741
Nothing undermines our way of
life more than the taking of it.

27:42.757 --> 27:44.041
I'll drink to that.

27:52.336 --> 27:55.464
The truth is, Judge Fenton
could rule either way tomorrow.

27:55.465 --> 27:56.760
I could lose my witness.

27:56.761 --> 27:59.079
I'm a little worried about it.

27:59.080 --> 28:00.829
Well, in that case, be ready.

28:01.452 --> 28:02.570
How do you mean?

28:02.571 --> 28:04.131
Ready with another
case against him.

28:04.132 --> 28:06.125
How did the FBI get Johnny Vega

28:06.126 --> 28:08.297
to cooperate against
the Rulanti family

28:08.298 --> 28:09.292
in the first place?

28:09.743 --> 28:11.410
They have something on him.

28:11.411 --> 28:14.378
Interstate prostitution
trafficking, for instance.

28:14.379 --> 28:15.322
Okay.

28:15.323 --> 28:19.561
And we know how the Feds like to
memorialize their cases on tape.

28:19.562 --> 28:21.570
Wiretaps. Surveillance.

28:21.571 --> 28:23.702
And since the cases
haven't been brought,

28:23.703 --> 28:25.027
none of it's been released.

28:25.028 --> 28:27.677
Well, maybe the right
people haven't been asking.

28:29.531 --> 28:32.190
I do have a friend in the
U.S. Attorney's office.

28:32.191 --> 28:35.758
Well, if things don't
go your way tomorrow...

28:38.014 --> 28:39.090
Ms. Reagan,

28:39.091 --> 28:40.703
I have read your objection

28:40.704 --> 28:42.700
to the defense's motion
to compel discovery.

28:42.701 --> 28:44.748
Your Honor, the release
of said testimony

28:44.749 --> 28:46.752
would reveal the
identity of the witness

28:46.753 --> 28:48.390
and put his or her life in danger.

28:48.391 --> 28:49.356
Objection.

28:49.357 --> 28:50.902
Much as we appreciate

28:50.903 --> 28:53.277
Ms. Reagan's apparent
competency in legal matters,

28:53.278 --> 28:54.999
we don't subscribe to her ability

28:55.000 --> 28:56.662
to predict the future, Your Honor.

28:56.663 --> 28:57.705
Sustained.

28:57.706 --> 28:59.864
Ms. Reagan,
your objection is denied.

28:59.865 --> 29:01.628
The recording will be
entered into evidence

29:01.629 --> 29:03.015
and made available to the defense.

29:03.016 --> 29:06.104
At this time, we would also
request a consideration for bail.

29:06.105 --> 29:07.476
Objection.

29:07.477 --> 29:09.953
Mr. Vega has strong family ties.

29:09.954 --> 29:12.215
Whose family...
his own or the Rulantis?

29:12.216 --> 29:12.965
Objection!

29:21.019 --> 29:21.751
Jolene?

29:21.752 --> 29:23.544
Jolene, Jolene, listen.

29:23.545 --> 29:25.345
Johnny Vega made bail.

29:25.346 --> 29:26.710
We just want to take
you somewhere safe.

29:26.711 --> 29:27.556
I don't think so.

29:27.557 --> 29:28.858
Look, the judge ruled the defense

29:28.859 --> 29:30.888
can hear the record of your
testimony against Johnny Vega,

29:30.889 --> 29:32.405
so get some clothes
on and let's go.

29:32.406 --> 29:34.656
No. No, I can't. I'm sorry.

29:34.657 --> 29:37.119
What is it? Did he contact you?

29:37.120 --> 29:38.922
- It doesn't matter!
- Did Johnny threaten you again?

29:38.923 --> 29:40.615
I'm not going to testify,
all right?

29:40.616 --> 29:42.042
You already gave a
statement to the ADA.

29:42.043 --> 29:42.959
I lied.

29:42.960 --> 29:44.801
- Jolene!
- I didn't...

29:44.802 --> 29:46.968
Just leave me alone!

29:47.593 --> 29:49.289
This is what he wants, you know.

29:49.922 --> 29:51.486
He wants you to be scared!

29:55.902 --> 29:57.655
I'm well aware of John Vega.

29:57.656 --> 29:59.155
And I know about the RICO.

29:59.156 --> 30:00.958
I'm not willing to bend on murder.

30:00.959 --> 30:03.160
Well, with the last name Reagan,
why would you?

30:03.161 --> 30:05.271
But you know that giving you
access to the FBI's surveillance

30:05.272 --> 30:06.548
is going to cause
beaucoup problems for me.

30:06.549 --> 30:08.762
David, you're a
dedicated U.S. Attorney.

30:08.763 --> 30:11.135
I know you don't want this guy
walking around anymore than I do.

30:11.136 --> 30:12.877
I can't jeopardize
the Rulanti case.

30:12.878 --> 30:14.418
You won't be jeopardizing it.

30:14.846 --> 30:16.913
I will wait to bring
my pretrial motions

30:16.914 --> 30:18.849
against Vega until after
your RICO charges.

30:18.850 --> 30:21.252
You'll still have first dibs.

30:21.253 --> 30:23.287
Can we discuss this over dinner?

30:23.288 --> 30:27.053
David... I want that material.

30:27.599 --> 30:29.026
Hey, Danny, it's me.

30:29.027 --> 30:32.059
Got something for your viewing
and listening pleasure.

30:38.169 --> 30:41.137
Six hours of this, and nothing.

30:41.138 --> 30:42.705
No. I can't do it anymore.

30:42.706 --> 30:44.674
I cannot watch any more

30:44.675 --> 30:47.009
mobsters and whores hanging out.

30:47.010 --> 30:48.644
Tell me about it.

30:51.948 --> 30:53.315
Well, there's Johnny Vega.

30:53.316 --> 30:55.151
Wait a minute...
Check this guy out.

30:55.807 --> 30:56.785
What?

30:56.786 --> 30:57.919
Yeah. It's another midlife crisis

30:57.920 --> 31:02.253
overpaying some 20-year-old
to make him feel desirable.

31:02.254 --> 31:02.923
Forget it.

31:02.924 --> 31:04.892
I lost interest after
the first four hours.

31:04.893 --> 31:07.094
No, there's something
about this guy.

31:07.095 --> 31:08.396
I've seen him around somewhere.

31:08.397 --> 31:10.265
- Wait. Do me a favor?
- Yeah.

31:10.548 --> 31:11.932
Run this license plate.

31:11.933 --> 31:13.299
King-Nora-Queen,

31:13.300 --> 31:15.143
eight-six-three-three.

31:17.573 --> 31:19.540
Whoa.

31:19.541 --> 31:21.442
What? You're never
going to believe this.

31:21.443 --> 31:22.018
What?

31:22.019 --> 31:24.311
The plate belongs to Judge Fenton.

31:24.681 --> 31:26.747
Are you kidding me?

31:27.640 --> 31:29.716
And it's not even my birthday.

31:33.288 --> 31:35.888
Uh, we missed you at the Police
Foundation Honors, Frank.

31:35.889 --> 31:38.091
Police Foundation
honors its mayor,

31:38.092 --> 31:40.893
uh, am I wrong in thinking
that the police commissioner

31:40.894 --> 31:42.395
might want to make an appearance?

31:42.396 --> 31:43.663
I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor.

31:43.664 --> 31:44.931
I had urgent police business.

31:44.932 --> 31:46.366
So, um...

31:46.367 --> 31:49.749
now, what's your excuse for
ducking our meeting today

31:49.750 --> 31:51.837
with the FBI Bureau
Director in Charge?

31:51.838 --> 31:53.600
I don't have one.

31:54.406 --> 31:56.875
What am I supposed
to do with that?

31:56.876 --> 31:59.645
They want your guys to
back off the Vega case.

31:59.646 --> 32:02.281
I am not your apologist, Frank,

32:02.282 --> 32:04.484
and when the federal
government wants... demands!...

32:04.485 --> 32:06.385
a meeting, I won't have you

32:06.386 --> 32:08.987
letting me stand there alone
like an idiot, holding my...

32:08.988 --> 32:10.289
Sir...

32:10.290 --> 32:11.390
What is it, Baker?

32:11.391 --> 32:12.491
I'm sorry, but you said

32:12.492 --> 32:14.192
to interrupt if we heard
from Detective Carter,

32:14.193 --> 32:15.527
and he's on line one.

32:15.528 --> 32:16.961
He's located Theodore Wessel.

32:16.962 --> 32:18.996
I have to take this call,
Mr. Mayor.

32:18.997 --> 32:20.432
Yeah, I understand.

32:20.864 --> 32:23.284
Urgent police business, right?

32:23.285 --> 32:24.205
Lives at stake.

32:24.556 --> 32:25.554
Etcetera.

32:32.777 --> 32:34.978
Bring him in.

32:39.306 --> 32:40.749
You're tired?

32:41.473 --> 32:43.507
Well, that's too bad,
'cause nobody's gonna sleep

32:43.508 --> 32:45.009
until I find out what happened!

32:45.513 --> 32:46.692
I don't know what happened.

32:46.693 --> 32:48.111
How many times do
I got to tell you?

32:48.112 --> 32:50.351
- I didn't have nothing to do with it.
- You did!

32:50.352 --> 32:54.114
You killed a kid, and then you
buried him behind the wall!

32:54.115 --> 32:55.954
You were the super
of the building.

32:55.955 --> 32:57.757
Nobody would've thought anything

32:57.758 --> 32:59.941
if they saw you down
there covered in dust!

32:59.942 --> 33:00.943
You don't know what
you're talking about.

33:00.944 --> 33:03.471
Everybody in the building
had access to the basement.

33:03.472 --> 33:06.254
There's 150 storage lockers
in the laundry room.

33:06.255 --> 33:08.112
You know what? I can't
stand the sight of you.

33:11.802 --> 33:13.736
He's not giving it up, Frank.

33:13.737 --> 33:15.204
I know.

33:15.205 --> 33:16.906
We got nothing without
his confession.

33:16.907 --> 33:19.475
I've been in there with
him for four hours.

33:19.476 --> 33:21.183
I want to talk to him.

33:23.046 --> 33:25.381
Okay, Commissioner.

33:33.422 --> 33:35.056
Remember me?

33:35.057 --> 33:37.926
I think you're the
police commissioner.

33:38.697 --> 33:40.428
I am now.

33:40.429 --> 33:42.530
You were the superintendent
of a building

33:42.531 --> 33:46.267
that Leo Gates passed by on
the way to and from school.

33:46.268 --> 33:48.302
We talked on, uh...

33:48.303 --> 33:53.240
November 10, the day...
after Leo went missing.

33:53.241 --> 33:55.075
I was the super of the building.

33:55.076 --> 33:56.843
I already told the detective that.

33:56.844 --> 33:58.245
Well, can I, uh,

33:58.246 --> 34:00.714
get you something to eat
or drink, Mr. Wessel?

34:00.715 --> 34:02.548
I just want to get out of here.

34:02.549 --> 34:06.019
I'm not gonna tell you anything
different than I did him.

34:07.424 --> 34:08.853
We found this...

34:09.614 --> 34:11.991
in Leo Gates' backpack
with his remains.

34:11.992 --> 34:14.127
It's a fourth grade
writing assignment.

34:15.072 --> 34:17.094
Kind of a fill-in-the-blank
biography.

34:17.096 --> 34:18.196
November 9.

34:18.197 --> 34:21.199
"Leo Gates," Name,
"Cares deeply about:

34:21.199 --> 34:22.534
"My family.

34:22.534 --> 34:24.168
"What do you want to be?

34:24.170 --> 34:25.804
"Professional baseball player.

34:25.804 --> 34:27.139
"What do you love?

34:27.139 --> 34:29.206
"Anything to do with baseball.

34:29.208 --> 34:31.409
"What do you fear?

34:31.411 --> 34:34.745
Not being able to hit a baseball."

34:34.746 --> 34:36.420
Imagine that, Ted.

34:37.815 --> 34:41.085
Before November 9,
all Leo was afraid of

34:41.368 --> 34:43.719
was not being able
to hit a baseball.

34:47.126 --> 34:48.326
Why are you doing this?

34:48.327 --> 34:52.295
Well, I just wanted to
clear some things up.

34:52.295 --> 34:55.665
When we talked on November 10,

34:55.666 --> 34:57.334
you were wearing

34:57.335 --> 34:59.336
"Blue work shirt, khaki trousers,

34:59.337 --> 35:00.703
"Tan work boots

35:00.704 --> 35:01.998
and a tool belt."

35:03.907 --> 35:05.774
Well...

35:05.775 --> 35:10.679
that's all I really had in
my notes... that mattered,

35:10.680 --> 35:14.516
but... I have a pretty
good memory, Ted.

35:14.517 --> 35:15.769
So...

35:16.853 --> 35:20.356
I'm in my office, staring out...

35:20.357 --> 35:22.691
at my city, and I thought

35:22.692 --> 35:25.894
of what my superintendent
used to say:

35:25.895 --> 35:29.531
"If it moves, you duct-tape it,
if it squeaks, you WD-40 it,

35:29.532 --> 35:32.704
and if it's stuck,
you hit it with a hammer."

35:32.705 --> 35:35.537
And I don't know, I think
that kind of jogged my memory,

35:35.538 --> 35:38.338
because all of a sudden,
I had this...

35:38.339 --> 35:40.340
kind of photograph in my mind,

35:40.341 --> 35:42.802
and I realized that
when we talked...

35:44.321 --> 35:47.848
your hammer was missing
from your tool belt.

35:50.227 --> 35:51.886
And that's when I knew.

35:52.813 --> 35:55.688
I-I wouldn't hit a kid in
the head with a hammer.

35:55.689 --> 35:58.057
That's how Leo was killed;
how'd you know that?

35:58.675 --> 36:00.927
Detective Carter told me.

36:00.928 --> 36:02.128
No, he didn't.

36:02.129 --> 36:04.030
I read it in the paper.

36:04.031 --> 36:06.132
It wasn't in the paper, Ted.

36:07.977 --> 36:10.446
P-People steal tools all the time.

36:10.447 --> 36:12.237
I mean, you set something down,
they steal it.

36:17.677 --> 36:19.259
Few days ago...

36:21.848 --> 36:24.850
...I had to tell Laura Gates...
that's Leo's mom...

36:24.851 --> 36:28.019
I had to tell her
that Leo was dead.

36:28.952 --> 36:30.320
In a way,

36:30.321 --> 36:32.924
she seemed relieved to know,

36:32.925 --> 36:35.092
finally.

36:35.093 --> 36:37.227
Because not knowing...

36:37.228 --> 36:40.631
had taken a terrible
toll on her, Ted.

36:41.632 --> 36:45.268
When you lose a child, it, uh...

36:45.269 --> 36:47.503
it seems so unfair.

36:47.504 --> 36:49.472
I know.

36:49.473 --> 36:51.775
I lost a son.

36:52.155 --> 36:55.111
And I think you'll
understand that...

36:55.112 --> 36:58.714
you never really recover
from a loss like that.

37:09.097 --> 37:10.627
Read it.

37:14.162 --> 37:17.364
Could you read it out loud?
Please?

37:20.102 --> 37:21.669
"Dear Mrs. Gates,

37:21.670 --> 37:24.739
"I am very sorry that
your son has disappeared.

37:24.740 --> 37:27.208
"I know how terribly
you must feel.

37:27.209 --> 37:29.043
I am sorry for that."

37:30.173 --> 37:32.746
I think a good person
wrote that letter, Ted.

37:32.747 --> 37:34.514
A man with a conscience.

37:36.317 --> 37:38.785
Someone who made a mistake

37:38.786 --> 37:43.046
and regretted it and carried it
with him the rest of his life.

37:44.092 --> 37:45.925
A mistake that haunted him

37:45.926 --> 37:47.660
till it broke up his marriage

37:47.661 --> 37:50.462
and turned him to alcohol
to dull the pain.

37:50.932 --> 37:54.000
A mistake that left him broken...

37:54.697 --> 37:57.269
and that he never recovered from.

37:59.272 --> 38:02.007
You wrote that letter, Ted.

38:11.050 --> 38:12.717
It was raining.

38:12.718 --> 38:14.218
He was all wet.

38:14.859 --> 38:15.795
That's all.

38:15.796 --> 38:17.455
Well...

38:17.795 --> 38:20.257
...just tell how you
didn't mean to do it.

38:23.219 --> 38:25.029
Just write down everything.

38:34.538 --> 38:35.772
I would like to file a motion

38:35.773 --> 38:38.274
to dismiss the charges
against my client.

38:38.275 --> 38:39.441
On what grounds, Counselor?

38:39.442 --> 38:41.144
This is absurd, Your Honor.

38:41.145 --> 38:43.379
The only witness has
recanted her statement.

38:44.581 --> 38:46.248
- Hold it.
- Excuse me.

38:47.284 --> 38:48.718
Hey, don't mind us, Judge.

38:48.719 --> 38:51.419
Excuse me, there's a
court in session here.

38:51.420 --> 38:52.526
Sir, you are out of order.

38:52.527 --> 38:53.955
Hey, I'm not the only
one who's out of order.

38:53.956 --> 38:55.223
Sir, sit down!

38:55.224 --> 38:56.558
I don't want to sit.

38:57.105 --> 38:59.126
Sir, I will find you in contempt!

38:59.127 --> 39:01.862
The only one in contempt
here is you, Judge!

39:01.863 --> 39:04.065
Judicial misconduct, solicitation...
Tell him.

39:04.897 --> 39:05.500
I'm Vincent Pellegrino

39:05.501 --> 39:07.820
from the Office of
Court Administration.

39:07.821 --> 39:09.537
Please step down, Your Honor.

39:09.538 --> 39:10.905
And don't call him "Your Honor""

39:10.906 --> 39:13.273
That word's reserved for
people who actually have some.

39:15.797 --> 39:16.577
Hey, Johnny boy.

39:16.578 --> 39:18.345
What is going on?

39:18.346 --> 39:20.847
Well, Judge Fenton has a starring
role in one of those videos.

39:21.523 --> 39:22.449
He got caught with
his pants down...

39:22.450 --> 39:24.718
both literally and figuratively.

39:24.719 --> 39:26.019
Ain't that right, Judge?

39:27.522 --> 39:30.489
That's why he's been ruling
on the side of Johnny Vega.

39:31.692 --> 39:33.125
This hearing is adjourned,

39:33.126 --> 39:36.329
pending a judicial review.

39:41.268 --> 39:44.836
Hey. Not bad for a
little fish, huh?

39:50.695 --> 39:51.943
Hey, look who's here!

39:51.944 --> 39:54.112
Hey, Dad! Hey, Dad.

39:54.113 --> 39:55.647
Hey.

39:55.648 --> 39:57.716
I heard what went on in there.

39:57.717 --> 39:58.850
Oh, yeah, classic Danny.

39:58.851 --> 40:00.417
Couldn't wait until
the hearing was over.

40:00.418 --> 40:03.220
He had to burst into the courtroom
on his big, white horse.

40:03.221 --> 40:04.355
Yeah. Good times.

40:04.356 --> 40:07.124
Hey, we hear the commissioner
got a signed confession.

40:07.125 --> 40:09.293
Great day for the family business.

40:09.294 --> 40:10.694
We're gonna go across the
street and celebrate,

40:10.695 --> 40:12.162
- pat ourselves on the back.
- Can you come?

40:12.163 --> 40:14.164
I got stuff to do.

40:14.165 --> 40:15.799
Go ahead, you kids go.

40:15.800 --> 40:16.932
Are you sure?

40:16.933 --> 40:18.733
Yeah. I'll take a rain check.

40:19.953 --> 40:20.836
Bye.

40:20.837 --> 40:22.204
See ya, Dad.

40:22.205 --> 40:24.540
Proud of you.

40:29.631 --> 40:32.114
I knew when they
found Leo's remains

40:32.115 --> 40:34.716
that you'd get the
person responsible.

40:35.366 --> 40:37.319
I know it's small comfort.

40:38.955 --> 40:40.955
It's the only comfort I have,

40:40.956 --> 40:43.458
that he'll be held accountable.

40:43.931 --> 40:46.127
I understand.

40:47.223 --> 40:49.196
You lost a son, too.

40:51.099 --> 40:54.669
Not a day goes by I
don't think of him.

40:58.807 --> 41:00.874
I have something.

41:00.875 --> 41:03.311
When they found Leo...

41:03.312 --> 41:06.145
this was in his backpack.

41:17.235 --> 41:18.658
Leo loved baseball.

41:26.433 --> 41:28.901
Can I thank you now?
