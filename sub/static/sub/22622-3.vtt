[ HOWLING ]

42:27.400 --> 42:29.567
IT CHANGED MY LIFE

42:27.400 --> 42:29.567
BECAUSE I REALIZE

42:29.567 --> 42:32.233
THERE IS MORE IN THIS WORLD

42:29.567 --> 42:32.233
THAN YOU KNOW.

42:32.233 --> 42:34.100
[ ROARS ]

42:34.100 --> 42:36.833
I JUST KEPT PLAYING IT

42:34.100 --> 42:36.833
OVER IN MY MIND,

42:36.833 --> 42:40.067
REALIZING HOW CLOSE THEY WERE,

42:36.833 --> 42:40.067
HOW WE WERE FOLLOWED OUT,

42:40.067 --> 42:42.767
ESPECIALLY WHEN THAT THING,

42:40.067 --> 42:42.767
THE LAST ONE THAT ROARED,

42:42.767 --> 42:45.200
LIKE KING KONG, WHEN IT SUCKED

42:42.767 --> 42:45.200
ALL THAT AIR IN.

42:45.200 --> 42:48.133
I MEAN, I'M NEVER GOING

42:45.200 --> 42:48.133
TO FORGET HEARING THAT.

42:48.133 --> 42:50.067
[ ROARS ]

42:50.067 --> 42:52.067
AND IF WE WOULDN'T HAVE LEFT

42:52.067 --> 42:53.867
OR WE WOULD HAVE

42:52.067 --> 42:53.867
DONE SOMETHING ELSE,

42:53.867 --> 42:56.233
I THINK THAT NIGHT

42:53.867 --> 42:56.233
WOULD HAVE GOT TRAGIC.
