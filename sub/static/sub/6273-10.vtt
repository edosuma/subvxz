00:00.066 --> 00:01.367
Narrator:  <i>Previously on</i>
<i>masters of sex...</i>

00:01.369 --> 00:05.304
It's safe to say that
we are not in the
best shape financially.

00:05.306 --> 00:06.438
The money
will sort itself out.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.474
I've been telling
your husband for
the last year

00:08.476 --> 00:09.775
He should
rent this space.

00:09.777 --> 00:12.077
It'd be better for
our end-of-year report.

00:12.079 --> 00:13.045
Oh, you're a
virginia referral.

00:13.047 --> 00:15.280
You've been a very naughty
orthopedist, dr. Langham.

00:15.282 --> 00:17.149
Dr. Langham:
<i>In spite of what</i>
<i>you may have heard,</i>

00:17.151 --> 00:21.587
My relationship
with my patients is
strictly professional.

00:21.589 --> 00:23.455
Let's give a big
cal-o-metric welcome

00:23.457 --> 00:26.225
To the new face
of women's nutrition...

00:26.227 --> 00:28.127
<i>Dr. Austin langham!</i>

00:28.129 --> 00:31.363
Hi. I'm frank,
and I'm an alcoholic.

00:31.365 --> 00:31.964
All: Hi, frank.

00:31.966 --> 00:33.832
Disappearing acts
have always
been my specialty.

00:33.834 --> 00:37.403
My dad taught
both of his boys
how to vanish.

00:37.405 --> 00:38.137
Didn't he, bill?

00:38.139 --> 00:39.772
Dr. Masters:
<i>I already knew</i>
<i>the whole story.</i>

00:39.774 --> 00:42.041
I knew it because
it's my story, francis.

00:42.043 --> 00:43.809
You're one of
the bravest people
that I know.

00:43.811 --> 00:46.945
<i>You just see what</i>
<i>you want and you...</i>

00:46.947 --> 00:47.546
<i>You go and get it.</i>

00:47.548 --> 00:49.314
Robert:
<i>May I help you,</i>
<i>mrs. Masters?</i>

00:49.316 --> 00:51.216
I was wondering
if you could
use my help.

00:51.218 --> 00:53.185
We need someone
to make a sandwich run.

00:53.187 --> 00:54.219
What can I get for you?

00:54.221 --> 00:57.890
Does drinking
help to relieve
your conscience

00:57.892 --> 00:59.992
About what it is
we are doing to libby?

00:59.994 --> 01:01.360
We have a greater
purpose, virginia.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.162
It hasn't been about
the study in years.

01:03.164 --> 01:05.397
We're not gonna
find the cure
for dysfunction

01:05.399 --> 01:06.565
In an exam room.
We're not.

01:06.567 --> 01:10.969
Tell me, bill,
which sexual dysfunction
are you proposing we treat?

01:10.971 --> 01:12.371
Mine.

01:14.040 --> 01:16.708
(theme music playing)

02:11.264 --> 02:12.865
You're comfortable?

02:13.733 --> 02:15.033
(sighs)

02:15.035 --> 02:18.370
I'm not good at staying
in one place for so long.

02:18.372 --> 02:18.871
(chuckles)

02:18.873 --> 02:21.440
There was a five-hour
wait at city hall

02:21.442 --> 02:24.476
The day francis and I
decided to get married.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.678
I wanted to come
again another day

02:26.680 --> 02:28.347
Because usually
I'm a whirling dervish,

02:28.349 --> 02:31.717
But francis sat
right next to me,

02:31.719 --> 02:33.051
Held my hand,

02:33.053 --> 02:35.254
Sang me all the
gilbert & sullivan

02:35.256 --> 02:36.421
Songs he could
think of,

02:36.423 --> 02:38.957
Just to make the
time pass easier.

02:38.959 --> 02:40.659
Husbands generally
don't come

02:40.661 --> 02:42.895
For their
wives' cappings,

02:42.897 --> 02:45.864
Although frank would have
been perfectly welcome.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.699
Not so sure
he believed that.

02:47.701 --> 02:50.736
I know you
and he had...

02:50.738 --> 02:53.071
Words, recently.

02:53.073 --> 02:53.972
(sighs)

02:53.974 --> 02:55.174
If you'd like him
here, pauline,

02:55.176 --> 02:56.275
I could have
my receptionist call him.

02:56.277 --> 03:01.580
I'd do it if there
were a chance of you
two mending fences.

03:01.582 --> 03:04.183
Well, there's really
no mending to be done.

03:04.185 --> 03:07.152
Meaning it's
not necessary?

03:07.154 --> 03:09.188
Or it's impossible?

03:09.789 --> 03:15.093
He didn't come here
to take you to task
for anything, bill.

03:15.095 --> 03:17.596
He's made peace
with his past.

03:17.598 --> 03:19.398
The program has
been so helpful

03:19.400 --> 03:20.265
For him
in that regard.

03:20.267 --> 03:22.501
I think he just wanted
to share with you

03:22.503 --> 03:24.269
All that he's come
to understand...

03:24.271 --> 03:26.138
And here I thought
you two came to me

03:26.140 --> 03:27.339
For fertility
treatments.

03:27.341 --> 03:30.342
We are desperate
to have a family.

03:30.344 --> 03:34.980
But I know for frank
that means...

03:35.648 --> 03:37.015
More than a child.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.116
Well, babies are
my stock-in-trade,

03:38.118 --> 03:39.651
So let's focus
on that, shall we?

03:39.653 --> 03:42.287
Now, what can I have
betty bring you?

03:42.289 --> 03:44.089
Frank, or perhaps
a magaz...

03:44.091 --> 03:45.591
(lights click)

03:47.227 --> 03:48.260
Dr. Masters: Uh...

03:48.262 --> 03:51.096
Betty: Um, yeah,
it won't happen again.

03:51.098 --> 03:52.397
Thank you
very much.

03:52.399 --> 03:53.899
(receiver clicks)

03:53.901 --> 03:54.566
What on god's earth?

03:54.568 --> 03:56.602
I just got off
the phone with the
electric company.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.470
I told them to check
today's mail,

03:58.472 --> 03:59.571
Where they would
find our late payment,

03:59.573 --> 04:02.641
Which they did,
so the lights should
go back on shortly.

04:02.643 --> 04:03.842
And why was our
payment so late?

04:03.844 --> 04:06.778
'cause I had to wait
for checks to clear

04:06.780 --> 04:07.779
From eight patients.

04:07.781 --> 04:08.914
We owed
the specimen lab,

04:08.916 --> 04:11.016
Which was threatening
to hold up our results.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.317
Then I had to put off
the electric company

04:12.319 --> 04:15.754
Until cal-o-metric's
rent came in on the 15th.
Should I go on?

04:15.756 --> 04:17.256
I understand things
are a little tight.

04:17.258 --> 04:21.126
Our only prayer
here is to sublet the
rest of this floor.

04:21.128 --> 04:23.795
I'm not gonna have
my patients sharing
lobby space

04:23.797 --> 04:25.097
With second-rate
businesses.

04:25.099 --> 04:27.599
Either it's tenants
who aren't so
fancy-schmancy

04:27.601 --> 04:30.836
But pay the rent,
or you're gonna be
doing pelvic exams

04:30.838 --> 04:32.904
With a miner's lamp
stuck to your forehead.

04:32.906 --> 04:35.140
I doubt those
are my only options.

04:35.142 --> 04:37.409
All right. Here's
another option...

04:37.411 --> 04:40.412
If we can't pay
the heat this winter,

04:40.414 --> 04:43.015
Then we're gonna be hosing
down these marble floors,

04:43.017 --> 04:45.150
Turning this place
into a skating rink

04:45.152 --> 04:47.286
And charging
admission.

04:48.054 --> 04:51.189
What's your suggestion
for viable tenants?

04:51.191 --> 04:53.525
I'm already
looking.

04:58.264 --> 05:00.265
(lights click)

05:25.325 --> 05:28.193
You don't seem
all that surprised.

05:30.129 --> 05:34.466
Was it helpful,
pretending to be
somebody else?

05:34.468 --> 05:37.836
I mean, did the
advice I gave you...
Did it help your friend?

05:37.838 --> 05:38.603
To be honest, no.

05:38.605 --> 05:40.972
(chuckles) no.
It was a disaster.

05:40.974 --> 05:44.676
I clearly did
not understand
how therapy works.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.945
Otherwise, I would
have realized how
ridiculous it was

05:46.947 --> 05:48.680
To think that I could
stand in for her.

05:48.682 --> 05:54.052
Maybe she provided
you with a reason to seek
treatment for yourself.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.320
No, I came
for her.

05:55.322 --> 05:56.388
And I'm only
here now

05:56.390 --> 05:57.956
Because I thought
I owed you
an explanation

05:57.958 --> 05:59.491
As to why
I wouldn't
be returning,

05:59.493 --> 06:00.492
As a patient,
at least.

06:00.494 --> 06:03.095
I would love
to be able to call
you in the future...

06:03.097 --> 06:04.429
I find this
work fascinating...

06:04.431 --> 06:08.767
If I have any
questions regarding
my own patients?

06:11.404 --> 06:13.972
Still, I'm wondering
if anything we discussed

06:13.974 --> 06:17.609
Seems to resonate with
you on a personal level?

06:17.777 --> 06:19.010
My relationship
with a married man...

06:19.012 --> 06:22.414
All the questions
you asked surrounding
that, why it ended.

06:22.416 --> 06:24.750
So, that was
your affair,
not your friend's?

06:24.752 --> 06:27.552
Yes, it was.
It is. It continues.

06:27.554 --> 06:28.387
But it's
not an affair.

06:28.389 --> 06:32.290
What does the word
"affair" connote for you
that "relationship" doesn't?

06:32.292 --> 06:36.027
Something that's
primarily sexual.

06:36.029 --> 06:39.398
And yours is not.
No. No. It's...

06:39.400 --> 06:42.300
It's far more
complicated than that.

06:42.302 --> 06:46.571
It has been
sexual in the past,
but it's not now.

06:48.207 --> 06:49.941
You and he...

06:49.943 --> 06:51.376
Don't engage in sex?

06:51.378 --> 06:52.878
No.

06:53.713 --> 06:56.181
And why is that,
may I ask?

06:56.183 --> 06:58.750
Uh, because he...

06:58.752 --> 06:59.351
...Is impotent.

06:59.353 --> 07:03.054
Dr. Masters:
<i>As you recall, there were</i>
<i>two years when...</i>

07:03.056 --> 07:04.723
We were apart.

07:04.725 --> 07:05.624
Virginia: But...

07:05.626 --> 07:09.628
...Since then...
Just in the past month,
we've been together.

07:09.630 --> 07:13.465
And I've taken care of
you each of those times.

07:13.467 --> 07:13.865
You...

07:13.867 --> 07:15.901
...Yourself
remarked on the...

07:15.903 --> 07:18.069
...Trend.
But...

07:18.071 --> 07:21.706
When libby had jenny,
she was capped, using...

07:21.708 --> 07:24.843
I have
secondary impotence.

07:25.478 --> 07:28.079
I can function...

07:28.081 --> 07:29.614
When I'm by myself.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.249
It's when I'm with a...

07:31.251 --> 07:32.150
A partner.

07:32.152 --> 07:33.819
So you and libby
have discussed this,

07:33.821 --> 07:35.654
And this is how
you've explained
this to her?

07:35.656 --> 07:39.024
Well, there
are things that
libby and I...

07:39.026 --> 07:40.592
Don't discuss,
and I...

07:40.594 --> 07:42.294
I'm not interested
in the explanation,

07:42.296 --> 07:44.729
I'm interested
in the cure.

07:52.405 --> 07:54.606
Well...

07:55.475 --> 07:58.677
With any patient,
we would...

07:58.679 --> 08:00.679
What? We would
explore a cause,

08:00.681 --> 08:03.215
A triggering
incident.

08:03.217 --> 08:05.884
Lester,
for example.

08:05.886 --> 08:06.485
He said that his...

08:06.487 --> 08:09.754
His problem
started when jane
rejected him.

08:09.756 --> 08:11.723
Well, that's lester.

08:11.725 --> 08:12.891
There's shelley.

08:12.893 --> 08:14.893
That's when
we stopped
coming here,

08:14.895 --> 08:15.861
Stopped
having sex...

08:15.863 --> 08:18.663
...When you
learned that I was
seeing shelley.

08:20.466 --> 08:21.733
Bill, you know
that...

08:21.735 --> 08:26.104
...Shelley wasn't
any kind of
rejection of you.

08:26.106 --> 08:28.073
Are you with him now?

08:28.075 --> 08:29.107
No, you know
that I'm not.

08:29.109 --> 08:31.009
I know.
You're not with
anyone at the moment.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.345
You're here...
With me, so if jealousy

08:33.347 --> 08:36.214
Or, or...
Insecurity were
the issue,

08:36.216 --> 08:38.884
Uh, there's no reason
for me to feel either.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.886
And yet my...

08:40.888 --> 08:42.687
...Difficulties
persist, so...

08:42.689 --> 08:44.322
So how can that
be the cause?

08:44.324 --> 08:47.459
The psychology
behind these
physical problems

08:47.461 --> 08:50.662
Is very complicated,

08:50.664 --> 08:52.063
And to understand
the "why" of it...

08:52.065 --> 08:53.131
Oh, we can spend
forever on the "why"

08:53.133 --> 08:57.536
And not get any
closer to finding
any kind of cure.

08:57.538 --> 09:00.906
You know, the point,
virginia, is, we...

09:00.908 --> 09:04.609
We have an opportunity here,
you know, to find a cure...

09:04.611 --> 09:08.547
Not, not just for me,
but for millions of men.

09:09.148 --> 09:11.216
We've drifted away
from the work.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.017
I... I admit that.

09:12.019 --> 09:15.420
But, but this
is the way back.

09:16.923 --> 09:19.791
I'm broken,
and you're the one...

09:19.793 --> 09:25.063
You...
You're the only one
who can fix me.

09:25.065 --> 09:28.967
Dr. Madden:
<i>So, you consider the</i>
<i>relationship to have a...</i>

09:28.969 --> 09:31.670
...Higher
purpose now?

09:31.672 --> 09:33.572
I do. Yes.

09:33.574 --> 09:34.973
He and I,

09:34.975 --> 09:37.042
We are uniquely
qualified

09:37.044 --> 09:38.176
To develop
a treatment,

09:38.178 --> 09:42.380
To prevent
countless marriages
from dissolving.

09:42.382 --> 09:43.782
Including his?
Your partner's?

09:43.784 --> 09:47.719
(chuckles) no,
his marriage is not at risk.

09:47.954 --> 09:52.524
You don't think
his wife feels the loss of
his sexual companionship?

09:52.526 --> 09:53.625
I... Maybe I...

09:53.627 --> 09:58.163
I can cure him
and send him back home
to his marital bed.

09:58.165 --> 10:00.098
That's very
selfless of you.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.533
I...

10:01.535 --> 10:03.535
I was joking.

10:03.769 --> 10:06.071
And I don't
think that sarcasm

10:06.073 --> 10:08.807
Really has a place
in therapy, do you?

10:08.809 --> 10:11.343
Did I misrepresent
your intentions?

10:11.711 --> 10:12.911
I think that
you are making

10:12.913 --> 10:16.047
Some kind of
judgment about me.

10:16.148 --> 10:18.817
Doctor,
I can assure you,

10:18.819 --> 10:21.653
I am at peace with
this situation now.

10:21.655 --> 10:22.554
I think if that
were true,

10:22.556 --> 10:24.889
You would have
telephoned me to
cancel the session

10:24.891 --> 10:27.525
Instead of
showing up here.

10:27.527 --> 10:29.260
All right. Well...

10:29.262 --> 10:31.162
Uh, why don't you tell me?
Why am I here?

10:31.164 --> 10:35.200
I think you want me
to be all right with you.

10:38.938 --> 10:41.272
In the very short time
you've been coming here,

10:41.274 --> 10:43.508
You admitted to
deceiving two people...

10:43.510 --> 10:46.044
Me, in pretending
to be someone else...

10:46.046 --> 10:46.811
(sighs)

10:46.813 --> 10:48.013
...And your
lover's wife,

10:48.015 --> 10:52.717
In carrying on
a relationship
behind her back.

10:52.719 --> 10:57.222
Is there anyone else
you may have deceived?

10:57.823 --> 10:59.491
(sighs)

11:00.426 --> 11:03.395
You want me to
say "myself," right,

11:03.397 --> 11:05.964
That I've deceived myself?

11:12.505 --> 11:15.540
<i>â™ª mama's gonna</i>
<i>buy you a mocking bird</i>

11:15.542 --> 11:17.976
<i>â™ª and if that...</i>

11:17.978 --> 11:21.146
Libby promised
helping out with this,
uh...

11:21.148 --> 11:25.784
Civil rights office
wouldn't interfere
with dinner.

11:25.786 --> 11:28.119
I'm happy
to start dinner.

11:28.121 --> 11:33.091
This little one
is out like
a light already.

11:33.093 --> 11:35.727
Lullabies never
worked with you.

11:35.729 --> 11:39.197
You'd stare at me with
that expression that said,

11:39.199 --> 11:42.033
"I will not sleep, ever."

11:42.035 --> 11:42.801
(chuckles)

11:42.803 --> 11:46.571
Whereas francis would
just hum along happily,

11:46.573 --> 11:47.906
Even before
he could speak.

11:47.908 --> 11:51.209
Always the
entertainer, francis.

11:51.211 --> 11:55.513
He's more serious
now, don't you think?

11:55.715 --> 11:56.715
When francis
was a child,

11:56.717 --> 12:00.885
You couldn't see
a little darkness in him,
under all that light?

12:00.887 --> 12:02.353
He tells me now
I should have,

12:02.355 --> 12:06.658
That his good cheer
was an act of...
What did he say?

12:06.660 --> 12:08.860
Self-preservation.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.662
You believe that?

12:10.664 --> 12:13.164
Well, if I've
learned anything,

12:13.166 --> 12:15.867
It's that everyone
has their own version

12:15.869 --> 12:19.804
Of everything
that's ever happened.

12:21.240 --> 12:21.773
(sighs)

12:21.775 --> 12:25.710
Francis doesn't
like the fact that I have
a drink every night.

12:25.712 --> 12:27.345
He hasn't said
anything to my face,

12:27.347 --> 12:31.583
But I can see his
disapproving looks.

12:31.585 --> 12:35.887
You don't think I drink
too much, do you, billy?

12:37.022 --> 12:40.024
I think you drink, uh,
as much as you want,

12:40.026 --> 12:43.361
Which is
as it should be.
Huh.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.029
It's that
program of his,

12:45.031 --> 12:46.831
If we're gonna
be perfectly honest.

12:46.833 --> 12:49.300
I mean, good for him,
if it helps.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.002
All I want is for
my sons to be happy.

12:51.004 --> 12:56.274
But I also think
it can turn a person
into a policeman.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.375
Or an amateur
psychiatrist.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.344
Or a member
of a secret club.

12:59.346 --> 13:03.414
Has he used the word
"amends" with you?

13:03.416 --> 13:06.684
I mean, why do you need
such a fancy word
for saying "I'm sorry"?

13:06.686 --> 13:08.052
And who will
these "amends" help?

13:08.054 --> 13:11.156
It's not like they're
making things right...

13:11.158 --> 13:13.324
...Dragging up the past,

13:13.326 --> 13:15.326
Spinning it so
it only serves them.

13:15.328 --> 13:18.930
Has he forgiven you for
something you didn't do?

13:18.932 --> 13:19.597
(sighs and chuckles)

13:19.599 --> 13:24.435
I just said,
"thank you, francis.
That's very generous of you."

13:24.437 --> 13:27.639
But it felt a little
like an accusation

13:27.641 --> 13:30.775
That's dressed up
to be an apology.

13:31.277 --> 13:33.511
I'm being too harsh.

13:33.513 --> 13:34.679
No, you're not.

13:34.681 --> 13:38.316
(vehicle approaches)

13:38.318 --> 13:39.884
My wife.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.854
Home from work.

13:44.123 --> 13:45.790
Robert:
We split everyone
into four groups.

13:45.792 --> 13:48.760
One group takes
the towers here
by north jefferson.

13:48.762 --> 13:51.663
There's 10 towers
down by carr street,

13:51.665 --> 13:52.530
So we'll put two
groups on those.

13:52.532 --> 13:56.467
And the rest will
start here by north 20th
and move west.

13:56.469 --> 14:00.238
So, let's get on
the phones and make
sure we deliver

14:00.240 --> 14:03.241
The best turnout
possible, all right?

14:05.644 --> 14:07.846
Uh, what time
is everyone
meeting tomorrow?

14:07.848 --> 14:11.015
I need to
make arrangements
for my children.

14:11.017 --> 14:11.983
You're not coming.

14:11.985 --> 14:15.153
You just said you need
as many people as possible.

14:15.155 --> 14:17.422
The right people.

14:19.124 --> 14:21.893
I can do as much
as anyone else.

14:21.895 --> 14:24.262
Look, we will be
knocking on the doors

14:24.264 --> 14:27.632
Of dirt-poor negroes
with no jobs,
no prospects,

14:27.634 --> 14:30.235
And probably already
lost any ounce of
dignity they ever had,

14:30.237 --> 14:34.239
And we're gonna
try to convince them
to stop paying rent

14:34.241 --> 14:37.308
On the only decent
apartment most of them
have ever lived in.

14:37.310 --> 14:41.212
I would hardly call
a rat-infested slum
a decent place to live.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.648
You'd just be one more
white person showing up,

14:43.650 --> 14:45.116
Trying to tell them
how to live their lives.

14:45.118 --> 14:49.387
These folks take
one look at you,
they'll close the doors.

14:49.855 --> 14:53.758
And besides, there's rats
in those towers...

14:53.760 --> 14:54.826
And lice, too.

14:54.828 --> 14:58.730
And I think we both know
how you feel about lice.

14:58.732 --> 15:01.566
Now, if you're looking
for something to do,

15:01.568 --> 15:04.269
You can start
by getting lunch.

15:04.503 --> 15:05.803
And no more
tuna salad.

15:05.805 --> 15:09.307
We're all sick to death
of tuna salad.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.015
(music playing softly)

15:17.017 --> 15:21.052
Oh, he does give us
credit in the footnotes.

15:22.187 --> 15:24.789
"masters and johnson...

15:24.791 --> 15:27.759
"were the first to
identify specific stages

15:27.761 --> 15:32.297
"of sexual arousal,
four in all, in a 1958 study.

15:32.299 --> 15:35.233
"they have since ceased
their clinical research."

15:35.235 --> 15:38.536
Well, I'll just have
to call mr. Kaufman

15:38.538 --> 15:40.271
And let him
know we are still...
Don't call him.

15:40.273 --> 15:44.175
The worst thing
we can possibly do
is rouse the beast.

15:44.177 --> 15:45.843
The beast?
"only found four."

15:45.845 --> 15:48.012
He's come up with
the other two stages

15:48.014 --> 15:50.114
Purely to distinguish
his work from ours.

15:50.116 --> 15:51.849
It's one study
in a small journal.

15:51.851 --> 15:55.687
The  <i>american urology review</i>
<i>is a respected journal.</i>

15:55.689 --> 15:58.022
And everything we did
in the past three years

15:58.024 --> 16:01.159
Could be erased by
dr. Joseph kaufman,

16:01.161 --> 16:03.995
Who has the audacity
to list "dormant"

16:03.997 --> 16:05.730
As a stage
of sexual arousal.

16:05.732 --> 16:07.031
Well, dr. Joseph kaufman
is wrong.

16:07.033 --> 16:08.633
Yeah, he's wrong,
and he's been published.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.501
Bill, I would not
overreact to this.

16:10.503 --> 16:11.569
Every name in
the history of science

16:11.571 --> 16:13.438
Is the name of the man
who got there first.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.306
Maybe it is,
but it says right here

16:15.308 --> 16:18.276
In this footnote
that we were the first
ones out of the gate.

16:18.278 --> 16:22.146
And it doesn't
mention a thing
about dysfunction,

16:22.148 --> 16:25.483
So we definitely
have the edge there.

16:27.152 --> 16:29.487
I'll...
I'll be right back.

16:44.103 --> 16:47.305
(indistinct conversations)

16:51.577 --> 16:55.580
Cindy:  <i>When my kids found it,</i>
<i>they thought it was a teepee.</i>

16:55.582 --> 16:59.751
They even used it
for playing
cowboys and indians.

16:59.753 --> 17:03.921
I didn't have
the heart to tell them
it wasn't a teepee.

17:03.923 --> 17:08.159
It was the only dress
mommy could still fit into.

17:08.161 --> 17:10.094
But...

17:10.295 --> 17:10.962
Not anymore!

17:10.964 --> 17:14.732
Smile, smile.
Clap, clap.

17:16.668 --> 17:18.336
(clears throat)

17:18.338 --> 17:19.137
That's right, folks.

17:19.139 --> 17:21.973
When cindy here
came to my office
three months ago,

17:21.975 --> 17:25.710
She weighed in at
nearly 200 pounds.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.178
I was a size 60.

17:27.180 --> 17:28.946
16. A size 16.

17:28.948 --> 17:30.281
The prognosis
was bleak,

17:30.283 --> 17:32.083
But the prescription
was simple...

17:32.085 --> 17:35.186
Just three small tablets
of cal-o-metric per day.

17:35.188 --> 17:38.923
And I went
from overweight
to feeling great,

17:38.925 --> 17:41.292
All thanks
to cal-metric.

17:41.294 --> 17:42.660
Cal-o-metric.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.562
Cal-o...With an "o."

17:44.564 --> 17:47.665
Why don't we take five
to collect ourselves?

17:47.667 --> 17:48.499
(gasps) ah.

17:48.501 --> 17:51.035
Can I use the
little girls' room?

17:51.236 --> 17:52.136
Yes.

17:52.138 --> 17:53.638
Thank you.

17:55.574 --> 17:57.608
Boy, she is fantastic.

17:57.610 --> 18:00.278
A regular barrymore.

18:00.345 --> 18:02.113
Say, I ran
into dick davis
yesterday,

18:02.115 --> 18:04.482
A fellow orthopedist
when I was
still at maternity,

18:04.484 --> 18:05.650
And told him
what I'm doing now...

18:05.652 --> 18:09.353
Touring the state,
starring in television
commercials,

18:09.355 --> 18:10.321
Helping women
from kennett...

18:10.323 --> 18:11.889
Here's this
week's schedule.

18:11.891 --> 18:14.692
Presentation at
vandervoort's department
store tomorrow,

18:14.694 --> 18:16.060
St. Louis zoo
on Wednesday,

18:16.062 --> 18:19.297
Jefferson county fair
this weekend.

18:20.232 --> 18:22.366
Tomorrow night,
435 harney avenue?

18:22.368 --> 18:23.901
What is that, a...
A woolworth's?

18:23.903 --> 18:28.606
My apartment.
Oh, and be sure to knock
because the buzzer's broken.

18:29.108 --> 18:29.707
I don't understand.

18:29.709 --> 18:32.777
Cindy and I, we're...
Presenting at
your apartment?

18:32.779 --> 18:33.778
Just you... And me.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.680
I thought we could have
some special time.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.315
Oh, you're not allergic
to cats, are you?

18:37.317 --> 18:39.450
Because
I'll be honest...
(sighs)

18:39.452 --> 18:42.553
I keep thinking about that
golden hair on your wrists,

18:42.555 --> 18:45.890
Wondering if that's the same
gold color all over your body

18:45.892 --> 18:49.594
Or does it get darker
as it gets thicker.

18:50.195 --> 18:52.130
I'd like to see
for myself.

18:52.132 --> 18:53.364
Tomorrow night.

18:53.366 --> 18:54.365
Same rules as the mall...

18:54.367 --> 18:57.735
Do not be late,
or you will be fired.

18:58.070 --> 18:59.570
Virginia:  <i>I've been</i>
<i>doing some reading,</i>

18:59.572 --> 19:04.142
And it turns out
that every
marriage manual

19:04.144 --> 19:05.510
Has suggestions
for impotence,

19:05.512 --> 19:08.713
Many of which
we already know
from betty.

19:08.715 --> 19:10.047
Um, but I've
typed up a list.

19:10.049 --> 19:13.818
Well, then you've
typed up a list of
remedies that don't work.

19:14.052 --> 19:17.288
Even if the treatment
is not 100% effective,

19:17.290 --> 19:19.557
We can still
learn something
from each one.

19:19.559 --> 19:22.793
I've already tried
all of betty's quackery
on lester,

19:22.795 --> 19:25.363
Nearly gave the poor
man a nervous breakdown.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.031
That's lester,
as you said.

19:27.033 --> 19:29.200
Although, the session
with lester did teach us

19:29.202 --> 19:34.338
That it's best to try
to resolve this condition
with someone familiar,

19:34.340 --> 19:37.708
And we are familiar
with each other.

19:44.583 --> 19:49.353
So, let's keep it
very simple today.

19:49.988 --> 19:54.492
I'll use my hands...
My mouth...

19:56.328 --> 19:59.463
...And you just relax,

19:59.465 --> 20:02.733
And stop
thinking about it.

20:05.204 --> 20:09.240
You know, I read
somewhere that before
leonardo da vinci

20:09.242 --> 20:14.946
Painted the  <i>mona lisa,</i>
<i>he did 140 failed sketches.</i>

20:14.948 --> 20:15.680
(water running)

20:15.682 --> 20:21.752
And before roger bannister
ran the four-minute mile,
he ran the 4:20 mile

20:21.754 --> 20:25.223
And then the 4:12
mile and so on.

20:25.225 --> 20:28.092
We've only covered
about a third of
the options on this list,

20:28.094 --> 20:33.731
And I have heard that
there have been
successes with hypnosis.

20:36.535 --> 20:38.069
(thud)

20:38.071 --> 20:40.338
(gasps)

20:43.542 --> 20:44.208
You okay?

20:44.210 --> 20:45.910
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I, um...

20:45.912 --> 20:47.945
(sighs) I'm just...
I'm... I'm a little dizzy.

20:47.947 --> 20:50.214
I... I'm okay.

20:50.216 --> 20:53.718
Here, um, come...
Come this way.

20:53.885 --> 20:55.186
Don't be
embarrassed at all.

20:55.188 --> 20:57.121
I almost went down
like a ton of bricks

20:57.123 --> 21:00.458
On my first look at
a retreating cervix.

21:03.061 --> 21:05.730
(stammering)
are... You're
one of the doctors?

21:05.732 --> 21:07.298
Oh, no.
I'm the archivist.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.267
I'm documenting
the study on film,

21:09.269 --> 21:11.969
To keep a record
of it for... Posterity.

21:11.971 --> 21:12.903
You make movies?

21:12.905 --> 21:18.042
I prefer to think of
it as telling the truth
24 times a second.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.910
<i>Le petit soldat?</i>

21:20.512 --> 21:21.112
Godard?

21:21.114 --> 21:25.483
So you must have
seen a lot of people
come in and out of here.

21:25.485 --> 21:27.385
Hundreds.

21:28.820 --> 21:29.453
Does it work?

21:29.455 --> 21:35.159
Dr. Masters says
that he could
cure me of my...

21:35.161 --> 21:37.094
Never mind.
(chuckles)
it doesn't matter.

21:37.096 --> 21:40.531
Dr. Masters
can cure anything.

21:40.533 --> 21:43.567
Well, most things.

21:43.569 --> 21:45.536
I mean, some things
no doctor can cure

21:45.538 --> 21:48.472
No matter how
good he is, right?

21:48.474 --> 21:50.041
You can't operate
on the soul.

21:50.043 --> 21:51.375
Only god
can do that.

21:51.377 --> 21:53.210
If you believe
in that sort of thing.

21:53.212 --> 21:55.946
I mean, lots of people
do believe, obviously.

21:55.948 --> 21:59.050
Before science,
you had to come up with some
way of explaining things.

21:59.052 --> 22:03.287
A man in the sky with
a beard makes as much
sense as anything else.

22:03.289 --> 22:05.790
That's oversimplifying
things a bit.

22:05.792 --> 22:06.557
Well, I only meant that...

22:06.559 --> 22:10.561
You know, people
need to find meaning
in something.

22:10.563 --> 22:14.198
They, they need to
believe in something.

22:14.200 --> 22:18.336
Second law
of thermodynamics is good
and pretty irrefutable...

22:18.338 --> 22:22.606
...That the universe
is hurtling inexorably
toward entropy.

22:22.608 --> 22:23.341
So life
is meaningless,

22:23.343 --> 22:27.578
And all the pain
and suffering is just
blind, random chaos.

22:27.580 --> 22:30.748
Thank you for the...
The water.

22:30.750 --> 22:31.382
Sorry. I...

22:31.384 --> 22:34.485
I didn't come up
with that theory.

22:34.487 --> 22:36.721
Blame lord kelvin.

22:37.522 --> 22:40.124
Brand new this morning.
Now I know why
they were on sale.

22:40.126 --> 22:42.426
(chuckles)
you are
a lifesaver, gini.

22:42.428 --> 22:45.963
More an expert
since I only
buy on sale.

22:45.965 --> 22:48.933
I didn't dare
ask for nail polish
downstairs,

22:48.935 --> 22:50.201
Not that they would
notice my run,

22:50.203 --> 22:53.371
Not that they would
notice if I mimeographed
for them

22:53.373 --> 22:54.705
In a day-glo bikini.

22:54.707 --> 22:55.973
(chuckles)
yes, well,

22:55.975 --> 22:58.709
They do seem
like a pretty
determined bunch

22:58.711 --> 22:59.577
Down at
the core office.

22:59.579 --> 23:01.812
They're determined
to make this rent
strike a success,

23:01.814 --> 23:03.814
Which I certainly
applaud them for.

23:03.816 --> 23:06.717
A rent strike
in this building?
Oh, no, no. At...

23:06.719 --> 23:09.353
At pruitt-igoe,
the projects.

23:09.355 --> 23:13.724
I'm sure bill didn't
tell you since he hates
my working there.

23:13.726 --> 23:14.825
The people in
the core office

23:14.827 --> 23:17.328
Think I'm nothing
more than some
bored housewife.

23:17.330 --> 23:20.498
Well, I'm sure
that they appreciate you.

23:20.500 --> 23:23.033
Trust me,
they don't,

23:23.035 --> 23:26.937
Which is why
I'm gonna canvass
with them tonight,

23:26.939 --> 23:29.707
Even though
they don't want me to.

23:29.709 --> 23:31.475
Bill agreed
to you going?

23:31.477 --> 23:33.677
(chuckles)

23:33.679 --> 23:34.912
Which is why
I need your help.

23:34.914 --> 23:40.217
I'm assuming you two
will be working
late tonight again.

23:42.154 --> 23:44.255
What if you told bill
that your sitter canceled

23:44.257 --> 23:46.590
At the last minute
and I'm filling in for her?

23:46.592 --> 23:48.659
That would explain
why I'm not home.

23:48.661 --> 23:49.860
Uh, you want
me to lie to bill?

23:49.862 --> 23:52.797
I could drop my kids
off at your house
with henry and tessa.

23:52.799 --> 23:54.331
I would pay for
the sitter, of course.

23:54.333 --> 23:58.102
No. That...
That would not
be necessary.

23:58.570 --> 24:00.538
It's a good cause.

24:00.540 --> 24:03.441
And we'd just
keep it between us.

24:03.443 --> 24:08.646
Unless the idea of
lying to bill is too...

24:08.648 --> 24:10.014
...Uncomfortable.

24:10.016 --> 24:11.982
Uh...

24:11.984 --> 24:14.885
It's not, in fact.
(chuckles)

24:14.887 --> 24:18.889
What time should
I tell the sitter to expect
you and the kids?

24:21.226 --> 24:23.360
Dr. Masters: This way.

24:23.362 --> 24:24.328
Ah, virginia, good.

24:24.330 --> 24:26.230
Uh, I want you
to meet shep tally.

24:26.232 --> 24:30.734
Mr. Tally is a partner
at williams & kulick
public relations.

24:30.736 --> 24:34.572
Well, you are as pretty
as the first day in June.

24:34.574 --> 24:35.573
Thank you.

24:35.575 --> 24:37.441
Forgive me. I tend
to think in terms
commodities.

24:37.443 --> 24:43.714
Mr. Tally was
instrumental in helping
my colleague, john rock.

24:43.716 --> 24:44.515
The john rock...

24:44.517 --> 24:46.484
Who developed
the birth-control pill?

24:46.486 --> 24:48.853
That one was a race,
I'll tell you...

24:48.855 --> 24:49.820
...Neck-and-neck
the whole way.

24:49.822 --> 24:52.089
Well, mr. Tally made
sure that dr. Rock
came in first,

24:52.091 --> 24:55.893
And he's going to
do the same for us with,
uh, dr. Kaufman.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.595
This is quite the space.

24:57.597 --> 25:01.565
Do you ever get the urge
to, uh, strap on
a pair of roller skates,

25:01.567 --> 25:04.368
Do a few loops
around the lobby?

25:04.370 --> 25:06.470
Uh, never. Once.

25:06.472 --> 25:10.441
I thought we could start
with the, uh, archives.

25:10.443 --> 25:11.642
Virginia: This is lester,
our archivist.

25:11.644 --> 25:15.613
Lester, mr. Tally
would like to see some
footage from the study.

25:15.615 --> 25:18.616
Mrs. Johnson and I
will join in a moment.

25:18.618 --> 25:19.216
Please.

25:19.218 --> 25:21.252
We cannot afford
an ad man...
A public relations...

25:21.254 --> 25:23.487
A pr man, who's
going to charge us

25:23.489 --> 25:24.755
To turn June
into a commodity.

25:24.757 --> 25:27.892
Look, either
joseph kaufman is
a footnote in our study,

25:27.894 --> 25:29.760
Or we're
footnotes in his.

25:29.762 --> 25:30.327
All...

25:30.329 --> 25:33.330
All I'm asking, for now,
is for you to join me

25:33.332 --> 25:35.132
In putting
our best foot forward.

25:35.134 --> 25:37.801
Show mr. Tally
the value of our work.

25:37.803 --> 25:40.137
(projector whirring)

25:40.139 --> 25:43.741
Turns out ejaculate
can travel up
to three feet

25:43.743 --> 25:47.778
From where the sperm,
uh, started
its original journey.

25:47.780 --> 25:48.879
(door opens)
oh, thank god.

25:48.881 --> 25:52.082
Mr. Tally,
I think the best way
to understand our work

25:52.084 --> 25:55.252
Is to start with
the four stages of
sexual response.

25:55.254 --> 25:57.955
Orgasms tend to
be shorter in duration
and intensity,

25:57.957 --> 26:00.958
But aside from that,
we've seen very
few changes at all.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.426
Our study has
already invalidated

26:02.428 --> 26:03.627
A whole host
of myths, uh,

26:03.629 --> 26:07.765
Regarding the effects of
aging on sexual response.

26:07.767 --> 26:09.099
Dr. Masters,
I'd like you to meet...

26:09.101 --> 26:10.467
Not right now, betty.
Herb spleeb.

26:10.469 --> 26:13.771
"when life kicks you
to the curb, call herb."

26:13.773 --> 26:14.705
Herb's a
divorce lawyer,

26:14.707 --> 26:15.906
Very interested
in renting office space.

26:15.908 --> 26:19.243
Mr. Tally, why don't
we continue to
the exam room?

26:19.245 --> 26:21.545
Should the
need arise.

26:22.881 --> 26:23.714
(chuckles)

26:23.716 --> 26:26.283
So, as we observe
clitoral stimulation,

26:26.285 --> 26:28.185
Testicular swelling,
skin flush...

26:28.187 --> 26:29.720
We measure heart rate
during sexual activity

26:29.722 --> 26:32.189
As well as prostatic
contractions,

26:32.191 --> 26:34.191
Vaginal elongation,
and so on.

26:34.193 --> 26:37.461
So, the two of you
catalog what happens

26:37.463 --> 26:39.730
To the human
body during sex.

26:39.732 --> 26:40.397
What else do you do?

26:40.399 --> 26:43.968
Uh, well, we've recently
begun a new
phase of the study,

26:43.970 --> 26:47.204
Treating patients
with sexual
dysfunctions.

26:47.206 --> 26:49.139
Okay. That's interesting.

26:49.141 --> 26:50.708
It's also, uh, premature.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.977
It's in the early stages.
We've barely begun.

26:52.979 --> 26:55.412
But we've already made
some major discoveries.

26:55.414 --> 26:58.449
Dr. Masters:
Discoveries we're not
yet ready to discuss.

26:58.451 --> 26:59.149
But will be very soon.

26:59.151 --> 27:00.985
If by very soon,
you mean years from now.

27:00.987 --> 27:04.288
Hey, you know what's
great about you two?

27:04.422 --> 27:05.522
This.

27:05.524 --> 27:08.525
The two of you arguing,
the back and forth.

27:08.527 --> 27:11.495
You are like every
married couple in america.

27:11.497 --> 27:13.764
No, we're
not married.

27:13.766 --> 27:15.265
Doesn't matter.

27:15.267 --> 27:17.301
Look, some scientist
comes on tv,

27:17.303 --> 27:20.738
Starts talking about sex,
people are gonna tune out.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.806
Maybe they think
he's a pervert, or...

27:22.808 --> 27:24.842
Or maybe they
just think he's dull.

27:24.844 --> 27:26.577
But the two
of you come on,

27:26.579 --> 27:31.048
Both scientists
and yet looking like
the nice couple next door,

27:31.050 --> 27:32.282
And suddenly I trust you.

27:32.284 --> 27:36.086
I'm... I'm sorry.
Us on tv?

27:36.088 --> 27:39.223
Cbs is looking for
documentary subjects.

27:39.225 --> 27:41.759
Your archivist
has hours of footage.

27:41.761 --> 27:43.727
We would focus
on the two of you.

27:43.729 --> 27:45.829
We'd make it
a human-interest story,

27:45.831 --> 27:47.364
Something along
the lines of, uh,

27:47.366 --> 27:51.535
"man and woman
researchers plumb the
mysteries of desire."

27:51.537 --> 27:59.443
The two of you could
finally teach america
how to have sex.

27:59.445 --> 28:01.512
On television?

28:01.514 --> 28:03.113
Mmm-hmm.

28:15.894 --> 28:18.529
Uh, you're right.

28:18.531 --> 28:20.364
I overreacted.

28:20.366 --> 28:24.868
Joseph kaufman is...
Is one article.

28:24.870 --> 28:27.805
It's a minor setback.
We'll... We'll catch up.

28:27.807 --> 28:29.306
Or we'll come
in second place.

28:29.308 --> 28:32.209
Which in this case,
would be last place.

28:32.211 --> 28:37.247
You said hiring mr. Tally
is not the best use
of our resources right now.

28:37.249 --> 28:41.318
I did, yes, and then
I listened to him.

28:41.320 --> 28:45.055
Bill, if only one
person gets the credit
in these things...

28:45.057 --> 28:46.290
I thought mr. Tally
was gonna land us

28:46.292 --> 28:48.792
In  <i>the american journal</i>
<i>of medicine,</i> not  <i>tv guide.</i>

28:48.794 --> 28:51.195
It is a less-specialized
audience, yes,

28:51.197 --> 28:55.265
But think of all
the people we could
reach, we could help.

28:55.267 --> 28:56.934
We could
alienate entirely.

28:56.936 --> 28:58.168
We already saw
what happened to

28:58.170 --> 29:01.405
A roomful of doctors
exposed to this work.

29:01.407 --> 29:04.475
Imagine what'll happen when
grandma turns on the tv and...

29:04.477 --> 29:06.744
...And finds the two of us
discussing swollen labia.

29:06.746 --> 29:11.115
Or maybe people
are ready to hear
what we have to say.

29:11.117 --> 29:12.816
Wilhelm reich died
in a prison cell

29:12.818 --> 29:15.352
Because of his theories
of the human orgasm.

29:15.354 --> 29:17.454
The fbi burned his research.

29:17.456 --> 29:18.589
Bill, this was your idea.

29:18.591 --> 29:23.327
You hired shep tally
because you want
attention, recognition.

29:23.329 --> 29:24.128
I want to win a nobel prize.

29:24.130 --> 29:28.999
I do not want my work
reduced to the warm-up hour
before mister magoo.

29:32.670 --> 29:34.438
I see.

29:34.440 --> 29:37.407
Well, then,
would you be able
to forgive yourself...

29:37.409 --> 29:39.209
...If you did nothing

29:39.211 --> 29:44.114
And joseph kaufman
walked away
with the prize?

29:45.016 --> 29:47.885
Robert:
We'll work in groups.
Three to a floor.

29:47.887 --> 29:51.355
Now, the elevators are either
broken or will break,
so we'll take the stairs.

29:51.357 --> 29:55.459
Be sure to tell the tenants
that you're not with
the housing authority.

29:55.461 --> 30:00.030
Remember that not everyone
will be happy to see you.

30:02.167 --> 30:03.567
Be patient.

30:03.968 --> 30:05.536
Let's go.

30:05.538 --> 30:09.740
(indistinct conversations)

30:12.210 --> 30:15.078
Put these up
in the common areas.

30:20.852 --> 30:23.153
(door opens)

30:31.462 --> 30:33.030
(knock on door)

30:33.032 --> 30:34.965
(children laughing)

30:34.967 --> 30:37.100
Good evening,
ma'am, I'm...

30:37.102 --> 30:38.335
Robert jefferson franklin.

30:38.337 --> 30:39.803
Robert: Delila,
tonight is serious business.

30:39.805 --> 30:43.373
Oh, nights are always
serious for you,
robert jefferson.

30:43.375 --> 30:45.175
(door slams)

30:50.381 --> 30:52.883
I can't afford
to lose my home.

30:52.885 --> 30:53.784
We understand
that, ma'am.

30:53.786 --> 30:56.954
We just want you
to understand that you
have certain rights.

30:56.956 --> 30:57.421
Rights?

30:57.423 --> 30:59.289
I don't even have
the right to have my
husband live with me.

30:59.291 --> 31:02.593
Look, this apartment,
this is all I have.

31:02.595 --> 31:06.396
Yes, ma'am.
Nathan, mama,
come inside now.

31:11.669 --> 31:15.205
Uh, mrs. Robinson
says she's interested.

31:15.207 --> 31:16.306
She wants to strike.

31:16.308 --> 31:17.541
You may have to convince
your daughter, though.

31:17.543 --> 31:21.044
Don't worry about that.
She'll do what
I tell her to do.

31:21.046 --> 31:22.880
Come on, baby.

31:30.889 --> 31:37.127
Double the olive brine,
so it's extra dirty.

31:37.129 --> 31:40.264
(sighs) the... Oh.

31:40.266 --> 31:42.332
Thank you. Um...

31:42.700 --> 31:45.569
Uh, we need to talk.

31:45.571 --> 31:47.504
You...

31:47.506 --> 31:49.806
Are so handsome.

31:49.808 --> 31:50.807
(both chuckle)

31:50.809 --> 31:53.176
I mean, my god...
(chuckles)

31:53.178 --> 31:57.414
If you had curly hair,
you would be david.

31:57.416 --> 31:59.283
The one in florence.

31:59.550 --> 32:03.921
Um, you know how much
I respect you, flo.

32:03.923 --> 32:05.455
And you are
one hell of a good boss.

32:05.457 --> 32:08.525
You know just
what to say to a girl.

32:09.727 --> 32:10.527
But I have to warn you,

32:10.529 --> 32:15.165
What you're asking me
to do tonight, it's, um...

32:15.767 --> 32:17.601
It's just not possible.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.770
Is that right?

32:19.772 --> 32:23.941
You see, when
you've been married,
uh, for 12 years,

32:23.943 --> 32:27.277
You develop a,
a knack for pretending.

32:27.279 --> 32:33.250
Pretending to...
To be in-interested
in 9/10 of the...

32:33.418 --> 32:36.219
...Chatter that comes
out of your wife's mouth.

32:36.221 --> 32:40.924
(stammering)
uh, but no matter how...

32:40.926 --> 32:43.794
How good you... You...
You get at pretending,

32:43.796 --> 32:48.398
There are certain things
that you... You...
You just can't fake,

32:48.400 --> 32:51.134
You know, when a man
doesn't feel about a woman

32:51.136 --> 32:54.404
Maybe in the same
way that she feels...

32:54.406 --> 32:56.073
She feels about him.

32:56.075 --> 32:56.873
Do you... Do you...

32:56.875 --> 32:59.343
Because, um, he, he,
he can... He can try.

32:59.345 --> 33:01.712
Oh, he can
try as hard as he...

33:01.714 --> 33:03.013
As hard as
he would like.

33:03.015 --> 33:04.114
He, he could lie to her,

33:04.116 --> 33:06.416
And he could,
he could also
lie to himself.

33:06.418 --> 33:09.353
But... (sighs)
he... He... (stammering)

33:09.355 --> 33:11.355
But his equipment
is not going to function,

33:11.357 --> 33:12.322
Do you understand
what I mean?

33:12.324 --> 33:13.724
It's not gonna function
because his equipment is...

33:13.726 --> 33:18.395
...Is a lot like
george washington
and the cherry tree,

33:18.397 --> 33:20.664
It cannot tell a lie.

33:25.570 --> 33:30.240
Looks like your
equipment's gonna be
just fine, dr. Langham.

33:30.242 --> 33:33.844
(slow-tempo music playing)

33:33.846 --> 33:35.512
(moans, panting)

33:35.514 --> 33:37.447
(cat purrs)

33:39.517 --> 33:41.184
(chuckles)

33:48.559 --> 33:50.560
Shall we start?

33:53.664 --> 33:54.498
What's the agenda?

33:54.500 --> 33:56.333
Why don't you let
me worry about that?

33:56.335 --> 33:57.501
Well, I just
think we should...

33:57.503 --> 34:00.704
I just think
you need to stop.

34:03.741 --> 34:07.611
Isn't there anything
you ever think about...

34:07.613 --> 34:09.246
...Doing?

34:09.781 --> 34:11.648
To me, I mean.

34:11.650 --> 34:13.483
Something unusual?

34:13.485 --> 34:18.255
Because I think about
doing things to you.

34:25.863 --> 34:29.299
I think about
making you powerless...

34:31.335 --> 34:34.104
Completely at my mercy...

34:37.075 --> 34:38.775
...Making you beg.

34:38.777 --> 34:42.546
I don't beg. You know that.

34:47.919 --> 34:49.486
(chuckles)

35:22.086 --> 35:25.455
You can't touch
my breasts...

35:25.457 --> 35:31.161
Not with your hands,
not with your mouth.

35:31.163 --> 35:32.929
I said no.

35:33.531 --> 35:36.633
You can't touch them.

35:37.902 --> 35:41.771
You can't kiss them...

35:41.773 --> 35:43.907
...Or lick them.

35:45.776 --> 35:48.178
No matter how
much you want to.

35:48.246 --> 35:51.681
No, I didn't say
that you could move.

35:51.683 --> 35:54.017
(breathing heavily)

36:08.032 --> 36:11.368
(breathing heavily)

36:12.970 --> 36:15.839
(moans)

36:20.511 --> 36:23.346
How much
do you want me?

36:24.115 --> 36:27.417
(breathing heavily)

36:32.423 --> 36:33.156
I do want you.

36:33.158 --> 36:34.958
I'm going to put
you inside of me.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.126
No, wait.
Keep talking.

36:36.128 --> 36:36.760
I am talking.

36:36.762 --> 36:38.028
No, don't, don't...
Don't touch me.

36:38.030 --> 36:40.497
What you said before,
say it again.
You're right there.

36:43.167 --> 36:44.668
You feel so good.
No, I don't.

36:44.670 --> 36:48.872
You do, bill.
That's not true,
virginia.

36:52.743 --> 36:54.044
Okay.
We can begin again.

36:54.046 --> 36:56.012
No, we...
We can't.

36:57.114 --> 37:00.016
It was working, bill.
God damn it!

37:00.418 --> 37:02.786
Just leave it.
Okay.

37:09.927 --> 37:11.461
Bill...

37:12.997 --> 37:14.664
(sighs)

37:19.237 --> 37:22.939
(cat meows, purring)

37:22.941 --> 37:26.142
(door opens, closes)

37:30.014 --> 37:32.282
(dr. Langham sighs)

37:34.385 --> 37:36.286
Have you seen my, um...

37:52.336 --> 37:54.304
Well, I, uh...

37:54.306 --> 37:57.407
...Hope that was
good for you.

37:57.409 --> 38:01.111
Well, I know
it was good for you.

38:01.113 --> 38:03.079
Both times.

38:06.484 --> 38:07.917
(chuckles)

38:08.686 --> 38:10.654
(clears throat)

38:10.921 --> 38:12.656
Well, now that we've...

38:12.658 --> 38:18.161
Gotten that out of the way,
I hope that we can resume
our professional relationship

38:18.163 --> 38:23.733
Without any sort of
awkwardness between us.

38:25.503 --> 38:28.204
What do you mean,
"out of the way?"

38:29.974 --> 38:33.677
This, you know,
one-time thing.

38:39.617 --> 38:42.786
Oh, flo, please, okay?

38:42.788 --> 38:45.689
I love this job.
I'm good at this job.

38:45.691 --> 38:46.990
I... I know how
to talk to women.

38:46.992 --> 38:49.326
I know how to make them
feel like, like, like, like...

38:49.328 --> 38:51.461
Like happiness
is one small dose
of cal-o-metric away.

38:51.463 --> 38:56.232
I know how to make
women feel, feel good
about themselves.

38:56.234 --> 38:58.168
So do that for me.

38:59.437 --> 39:01.805
Make me feel good.

39:01.807 --> 39:04.574
I used to be young
and beautiful, you know.

39:04.576 --> 39:08.311
Make me feel
like that again...

39:08.746 --> 39:14.784
...That young, pretty,
desirable girl.

39:17.254 --> 39:18.755
Okay?

39:25.463 --> 39:28.665
(indistinct conversations)

39:31.635 --> 39:33.336
Morning.

39:33.738 --> 39:34.704
Morning.

39:34.706 --> 39:39.376
We're, um, preparing
for the second canvas.

39:39.378 --> 39:41.444
It'll be the
night after next.

39:41.446 --> 39:43.213
Same time.

39:52.089 --> 39:54.524
How many signatures
did we get last night?

39:54.526 --> 39:56.259
In that first wave
of buildings?

39:56.261 --> 39:59.462
We're about at 30%.

39:59.464 --> 40:03.299
That's better
than you hoped.

40:03.401 --> 40:05.301
Yeah.

40:06.570 --> 40:08.238
Yeah. It's better.

40:29.093 --> 40:30.260
Do you mind
if I sit?

40:30.262 --> 40:33.430
I'd like to apologize.

40:43.140 --> 40:44.941
Is that the apology?

40:44.943 --> 40:46.075
No.

40:46.077 --> 40:48.611
Um, this is it. Um...

40:48.613 --> 40:51.748
I feel like I may have
offended you yesterday.

40:51.750 --> 40:52.515
Well, I...
(clears throat)

40:52.517 --> 40:56.586
I hate to break it to you,
but you're not the first
person to call me a nitwit

40:56.588 --> 40:57.754
Because
I believe in god.

40:57.756 --> 41:00.023
I don't think you're
a nitwit at all.

41:00.025 --> 41:04.127
I was always
jealous of people
that could believe.

41:04.129 --> 41:08.131
I went to grade
school with a guy,
freddy russo.

41:08.133 --> 41:10.633
He used to always
brag that whenever
he did anything bad,

41:10.635 --> 41:12.535
All he had to do
was go to confession

41:12.537 --> 41:14.637
And it was
like it never
even happened.

41:14.639 --> 41:16.673
Well, it's not
as easy as all that.

41:16.675 --> 41:18.274
I know, but...

41:18.276 --> 41:21.077
There is something
comforting in the idea

41:21.079 --> 41:24.981
That you just
have to tell the truth
and you can be...

41:24.983 --> 41:28.351
Absolved.
Mmm-hmm.

41:29.253 --> 41:32.922
I once heard
that the greatest
sin is despair.

41:32.924 --> 41:35.425
That's true, I think.

41:35.526 --> 41:37.627
When you decide
to just give up.

41:37.629 --> 41:40.930
I think I may
have done that...

41:41.732 --> 41:43.766
...Given up like that.

41:46.070 --> 41:47.403
I have a...

41:47.405 --> 41:49.472
...A condition.

41:50.474 --> 41:53.743
I can't do
anything in the, uh...

41:55.312 --> 41:57.247
...With a girl.

41:58.215 --> 42:00.917
Dr. Masters
tried to help me with it,

42:00.919 --> 42:02.552
But I, uh...

42:02.554 --> 42:05.488
I decided
it wasn't worth it.

42:05.823 --> 42:11.728
It was just too painful
and humiliating...

42:14.565 --> 42:16.699
...So I gave up.

42:20.004 --> 42:20.436
(chuckles)

42:20.438 --> 42:23.573
I guess that's
my confession.

42:26.911 --> 42:29.145
Okay, here's mine.

42:29.914 --> 42:32.916
I also have a condition,

42:32.918 --> 42:34.350
And I always thought that
it was god punishing me

42:34.352 --> 42:38.454
And that there was
nothing I could do but
learn to accept it.

42:40.090 --> 42:42.325
So I gave up, too.

42:46.330 --> 42:47.664
Greatest sin, right?

42:47.666 --> 42:49.566
(chuckles)

42:51.402 --> 42:53.903
Maybe it doesn't
have to be.

42:58.008 --> 42:59.909
I'm lester, by the way.

42:59.911 --> 43:02.078
Uh, barbara. Barb.

43:02.080 --> 43:02.845
(both chuckle)

43:02.847 --> 43:05.815
It's nice to
meet you, barb.
You, too.

43:09.353 --> 43:11.087
Mmm, did he
try the pump?

43:11.089 --> 43:13.990
I think that
he would rather
jump out a window.

43:13.992 --> 43:15.058
Can you blame him?

43:15.060 --> 43:18.094
Sometimes that cure
is worse than the disease.

43:18.096 --> 43:20.263
Mmm. Poor lester.

43:20.598 --> 43:23.833
You know, it can
get under your skin,

43:23.835 --> 43:26.402
That, uh,
particular problem.

43:26.404 --> 43:30.873
One guy, he used to come
in every Thursday night,

43:30.875 --> 43:33.810
Worked at the, uh,
florist's shop on jefferson.

43:33.812 --> 43:35.878
Always brought me
something new...

43:35.880 --> 43:41.851
Um, daisies one week,
lilacs the next, until...

43:42.052 --> 43:43.353
One time, he came in

43:43.355 --> 43:46.556
And he couldn't
get anything going.

43:46.558 --> 43:50.493
So, I pulled
out all the stops,

43:50.495 --> 43:55.565
But it was like
trying to raise the dead.

43:55.567 --> 43:58.701
So, uh, he got upset
and embarrassed,

43:58.703 --> 44:03.306
And I told him,
"come back next week.
You'll be fine."

44:03.308 --> 44:04.173
(betty sighs)

44:04.175 --> 44:05.908
And now every week,
he's coming in,

44:05.910 --> 44:09.412
Lying there for 30 minutes
while I'm going at it,

44:09.414 --> 44:14.083
Pretending that maybe
this time it'll work.

44:14.085 --> 44:18.354
I start taking
Thursday nights off,

44:18.356 --> 44:19.422
And he's...
(sighs)

44:19.424 --> 44:21.958
He's coming around
asking for me
on other nights.

44:21.960 --> 44:26.329
And I have the girls
tell him I'm out 'cause...

44:26.331 --> 44:31.934
There was something
about the way that
he looked at me, like...

44:31.936 --> 44:37.707
Like he was in agony
and I was the only one
that could fix it

44:37.709 --> 44:42.011
And why...
Why wasn't I fixing it?

44:42.013 --> 44:46.516
What was wrong
with me that I couldn't
make it right?

44:47.685 --> 44:50.887
You dreaded
seeing him.
Mmm-hmm.

44:56.627 --> 44:58.928
(telephone rings)

45:00.497 --> 45:01.698
(sighs)

45:01.700 --> 45:03.466
Masters.

45:05.335 --> 45:05.702
What?

45:05.704 --> 45:08.938
Francis, you always said
never to let a regular
doctor stitch you up.

45:08.940 --> 45:10.940
"you'll look
like frankenstein."

45:10.942 --> 45:13.776
I'm not angry you
called me, mother.

45:13.778 --> 45:14.243
(winces)

45:14.245 --> 45:15.678
I'm angry you
were drinking.
(sighs)

45:15.680 --> 45:18.715
Oh, honey,
for heaven's sake.
Don't be ridiculous.

45:18.717 --> 45:22.852
I had one tom collins,
like I have every night.

45:22.854 --> 45:24.420
That car came
out of nowhere.

45:24.422 --> 45:26.556
You're going to blame
the other driver?

45:26.558 --> 45:28.891
(sighs) that's where
the blame belongs,

45:28.893 --> 45:30.560
And the police officer
agreed with me.

45:30.562 --> 45:32.929
I can't listen to this.
Why don't you
ease up, frank?

45:32.931 --> 45:34.831
Oh, because
this is my fault?

45:34.833 --> 45:36.165
What about
what you're doing?

45:36.167 --> 45:37.600
What? Standing here,
comforting her?

45:37.602 --> 45:39.702
You are
enabling her, bill.

45:39.704 --> 45:42.271
She was drinking.
She got behind the wheel.

45:42.273 --> 45:42.872
One tom collins.

45:42.874 --> 45:45.408
You could've been
killed tonight.
Stop badgering her, frank.

45:45.410 --> 45:46.542
Our mother
has a problem.

45:46.544 --> 45:48.277
Our mother
has a laceration.
This is what you do.

45:48.279 --> 45:50.046
You just...
Put your head
in the sand...

45:50.048 --> 45:51.814
That's it.
...And continue
to ignore the fact

45:51.816 --> 45:53.549
That she is
an alcoholic.

45:53.551 --> 45:54.817
Alcoholic? Oh...
(sighs) alcoholic.

45:54.819 --> 45:57.587
All right, give me that
needle, and get out of here.

45:57.589 --> 45:58.688
I am still
stitching her.

45:58.690 --> 45:59.622
Not anymore.
Do not come near me

45:59.624 --> 46:01.924
When I've got a needle
near a patient's face.

46:01.926 --> 46:03.760
You two.
Don't start.

46:03.762 --> 46:04.727
Look what
you're doing to her.

46:04.729 --> 46:06.596
Giving her
the best medical care?
Estabrooks: All right. Enough.

46:06.598 --> 46:09.265
I am the patient,
and I say no more fighting.

46:09.267 --> 46:10.233
And I am the
plastic surgeon...

46:10.235 --> 46:13.636
And I'm telling you,
your privileges here,
in my office, are over.

46:13.638 --> 46:15.938
Now, you can either
leave of your own accord,

46:15.940 --> 46:18.307
Or I will remove
you myself.

46:18.309 --> 46:19.976
(sighs)

46:21.712 --> 46:23.412
(chuckles)

46:31.255 --> 46:33.122
We're nearly done.

46:33.124 --> 46:36.058
I'll get libby
to come over
and pick you up,

46:36.060 --> 46:37.493
And she can
take you home.

46:37.495 --> 46:41.931
Please, don't fight
with your brother.

46:41.933 --> 46:43.432
Please.

46:43.434 --> 46:45.535
I cannot stand it.

46:45.537 --> 46:46.702
(sighs)

46:46.704 --> 46:49.939
(elevator bell dings)

46:58.649 --> 47:00.983
This doesn't have
to end badly, bill.

47:00.985 --> 47:04.720
Please, um,
summon your better nature.

47:29.046 --> 47:30.580
(sighs)

47:30.582 --> 47:35.718
I came to you
after all these years...

47:35.853 --> 47:38.588
...With nothing but
the best intentions.

47:39.623 --> 47:41.624
After years of despair,

47:41.626 --> 47:44.460
I finally had achieved
some clarity.

47:44.462 --> 47:46.462
Clarity that
you're an alcoholic?

47:46.464 --> 47:48.064
That our mother...
(chuckles)

47:48.066 --> 47:51.534
...Is an alcoholic?
Who's next, frank? Me?

47:56.106 --> 47:57.940
(laughs)

47:59.476 --> 48:00.076
Of course.

48:00.078 --> 48:03.246
It took spending time
with you to see it.

48:03.248 --> 48:06.916
You mask it better
than most, but...

48:07.317 --> 48:09.318
You have
all the signs.

48:09.320 --> 48:13.256
Mood swings,
aggression,

48:13.258 --> 48:17.927
Impulsive decision-making,
chronic lying.

48:17.929 --> 48:19.395
Really?

48:19.397 --> 48:21.731
Who am I lying to, frank?

48:21.733 --> 48:25.468
(chuckles)
yourself.

48:29.806 --> 48:34.644
We are a family
with a shared disease,
a corrosive disease,

48:34.646 --> 48:38.047
And if you view us
through that lens,

48:38.049 --> 48:43.819
If each of us is able
to address our sickness

48:43.821 --> 48:46.022
And treat it...

48:47.591 --> 48:50.226
I believe we can mend
what's broken here.

48:50.228 --> 48:55.898
We can find some peace,
forgiveness, understanding.

48:55.900 --> 48:58.701
Faith, hope, charity.
Christ (chuckles)

48:58.703 --> 49:03.506
You toss around
platitudes like it's
confetti at new year's.

49:03.740 --> 49:06.776
I have surrendered.
That's all.

49:07.744 --> 49:10.913
Once I accepted my...

49:10.915 --> 49:14.283
...Our affliction...

49:14.285 --> 49:15.284
(chuckles)

49:15.286 --> 49:16.819
...All that self-pity,

49:16.821 --> 49:21.290
All that resentment
I had toward dad...

49:28.332 --> 49:31.100
I hated dad for so long.

49:33.036 --> 49:37.073
Do you remember
how he used to drink?

49:39.509 --> 49:45.247
One glass of seagram's,
neat, every night.
That was it.

49:45.249 --> 49:46.048
It was much
more than that.

49:46.050 --> 49:48.217
No, it wasn't, frank,
and for you to suggest...

49:48.219 --> 49:51.053
It all fits, bill!

49:51.055 --> 49:53.222
His drinking, his rages.

49:53.224 --> 49:55.691
For the first time,
I understand dad,

49:55.693 --> 50:00.963
His own feelings
of impotence and,
and self-pity.

50:00.965 --> 50:02.665
He was being
eaten alive, too.

50:02.667 --> 50:04.734
This is our father.
Our father was a monster.

50:04.736 --> 50:08.404
Yes, drunks
are monstrous,

50:08.406 --> 50:14.443
But our monster was a sick,
suffering alcoholic.

50:14.445 --> 50:16.679
He beat us
because he drank,

50:16.681 --> 50:18.347
But he drank
because he had a disease.

50:18.349 --> 50:22.585
He did not beat you.
That, that is not true.

50:22.587 --> 50:24.987
You know he did.

50:24.989 --> 50:28.257
You're lying because,
because you're needy,
you know,

50:28.259 --> 50:32.695
Because you think
that somehow, if...
If you take my story...

50:32.697 --> 50:33.796
Bill...

50:33.798 --> 50:41.637
Our drunk dad beat you,
and then he beat me.

50:48.078 --> 50:49.812
(sighs)

50:53.517 --> 50:56.419
But that doesn't
have to be the
end of the story.

50:56.421 --> 51:00.256
(sighs) that's what
I'm trying to tell you.

51:02.392 --> 51:05.027
(sighs)

51:06.129 --> 51:08.064
I forgive you...

51:10.033 --> 51:12.268
...For leaving me.

51:14.137 --> 51:16.305
And I forgive our dad.

51:18.809 --> 51:22.178
The man that
beat you, that...

51:23.213 --> 51:26.148
...Monster who beat you.

51:29.886 --> 51:33.722
What kind of man
forgives that?

51:36.426 --> 51:37.793
I do.

51:40.897 --> 51:42.631
(sighs)

51:51.675 --> 51:53.642
(sighs)

51:57.280 --> 51:58.981
And you...

51:59.850 --> 52:01.584
(sighs)

52:02.385 --> 52:03.853
...I'm sure you did
everything you could

52:03.855 --> 52:06.522
To avoid those
beatings, didn't you?

52:07.224 --> 52:09.992
First, you turned yourself
into a pathetic clown,

52:09.994 --> 52:12.728
With the jokes
and the magic tricks...

52:13.597 --> 52:18.267
Ways to deflect him,
try and run and hide.

52:18.468 --> 52:19.135
I did what I had to do.

52:19.137 --> 52:21.737
Yeah, but once I left,
you had nowhere left to run,

52:21.739 --> 52:25.107
You know,
once the real object
of his fury was gone

52:25.109 --> 52:26.942
And he needed
a replacement.

52:26.944 --> 52:29.311
This is your story,
right? Hmm?

52:29.313 --> 52:31.647
I forgive you, bill.

52:31.649 --> 52:33.482
That's what matters here.

52:33.484 --> 52:33.916
Yeah?

52:33.918 --> 52:36.852
I bet once
he threw the first punch,
you begged for mercy.

52:36.854 --> 52:40.956
What matters is
that we understand
what happened to us.

52:40.958 --> 52:42.925
You know I never begged
for him to stop.

52:42.927 --> 52:46.495
I mean, you heard us.
You were there.
I never begged.

52:46.497 --> 52:47.897
So... So why
did you, huh?

52:47.899 --> 52:50.366
Maybe the same reason
you're a drunk...

52:51.134 --> 52:53.736
A sloppy "alcoholic"...
Sorry...

52:53.738 --> 52:56.705
With your amends and
your steps and your chips,

52:56.707 --> 52:59.575
Clinging to your little
code words and your trinkets

52:59.577 --> 53:03.546
Because there is something
inside you that is weak.

53:03.548 --> 53:07.049
You know, you've always
been weak, frank...

53:07.350 --> 53:09.084
Francis, you know?

53:09.086 --> 53:12.988
Well, that's your real
affliction, is cowardice.

53:12.990 --> 53:15.591
You are a coward.

53:15.593 --> 53:17.459
You want to forgive me?

53:17.461 --> 53:22.431
Okay, forgive me
for not respecting you.

53:22.433 --> 53:25.267
You know, forgive me
for seeing you

53:25.269 --> 53:27.836
For what you really are...

53:27.838 --> 53:29.805
A weak little boy...

53:29.807 --> 53:34.443
...Who became
an idiotic clown,

53:34.445 --> 53:39.648
Who grew up to become
a gutless, pathetic man.

53:39.650 --> 53:40.482
(grunts)

53:40.484 --> 53:43.953
(both breathing heavily)

53:44.054 --> 53:45.154
What are you? A girl?

53:45.156 --> 53:47.189
(grunts)
huh?

53:47.191 --> 53:48.057
(grunts)

53:48.059 --> 53:50.859
Fuck you, frank,
you weak fuck!

53:52.796 --> 53:55.397
(chuckles)

53:56.499 --> 53:57.733
You been drinking, frank?

53:57.735 --> 54:00.135
(both breathing heavily)

54:00.137 --> 54:02.171
Huh?

54:02.305 --> 54:03.606
See, this...

54:03.608 --> 54:05.407
...This is what binds us.

54:05.409 --> 54:10.045
Him, living on in us,

54:10.047 --> 54:12.314
Not a bottle in sight.

54:19.155 --> 54:21.123
(sighs)

54:23.660 --> 54:27.196
(door opens, closes)

54:27.198 --> 54:30.032
Bill, I was thinking,
it's already so late.

54:30.034 --> 54:35.371
Why don't we just
go downstairs and have
some dinner tonight,

54:35.373 --> 54:38.007
Or maybe even
just some drinks.

54:42.145 --> 54:44.013
Oh.

54:46.549 --> 54:48.317
My brother.

54:49.753 --> 54:51.487
(sighs)

55:06.770 --> 55:08.771
(water runs)

55:20.817 --> 55:22.885
Don't. Don't.

55:22.887 --> 55:25.654
You don't...
You don't have to stay.

55:25.656 --> 55:30.859
I just, uh,
I just couldn't go home...

55:31.628 --> 55:34.263
...Face libby like this.

55:36.766 --> 55:38.367
(sighs)

56:16.606 --> 56:18.640
I abandoned him...

56:20.143 --> 56:24.146
...To that monster.

56:28.618 --> 56:31.754
And then
I punished him for it.

56:37.527 --> 56:40.329
What is wrong with me?

56:50.774 --> 56:52.474
I give up.

56:54.411 --> 56:58.947
(breathing shakily)

57:27.210 --> 57:30.546
(breathing heavily)

57:46.463 --> 57:49.264
(zipper unzips)

57:51.768 --> 57:54.803
(both moaning,
breathing shakily)
