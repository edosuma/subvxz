00:12.924 --> 00:15.358
Go, go, go !

00:16.664 --> 00:18.947
- Clear.
- Clear.

00:19.613 --> 00:21.273
We're cleared here.

00:22.634 --> 00:25.729
Surveillance had them all going
inside 45 minutes ago.

00:25.963 --> 00:28.951
- Did anyone bail out on the perimeter ?
<i>- No, ma'am. All secure out here.</i>

00:30.192 --> 00:32.960
Boss, this isn't a meth lab.

00:47.053 --> 00:49.338
So why an escape tunnel ?

00:49.551 --> 00:51.617
Need to take a look at this.

01:04.723 --> 01:05.807
Hotchner.

01:07.296 --> 01:08.150
When ?

01:09.473 --> 01:11.299
Did they raise the terror alert ?

01:12.070 --> 01:14.080
No, that's probably best.

01:14.094 --> 01:16.908
All right, get everybody in now.
I'll be there in a minute.

01:18.949 --> 01:20.651
What's going on ?

01:20.655 --> 01:23.061
Nothing. I just have to go
to the office.

01:23.377 --> 01:24.862
It's 6 :15,

01:24.878 --> 01:26.951
and you're talking about
a terror alert ?

01:28.997 --> 01:30.390
It's bad, isn't it ?

01:30.398 --> 01:32.051
I don't know yet.

01:33.096 --> 01:34.871
Please don't lie to me.

01:34.888 --> 01:36.513
It might be.

01:36.958 --> 01:38.900
I may not be home tonight.
I mean,

01:38.917 --> 01:40.941
- I might be home late.
- I know.

01:40.957 --> 01:43.961
Shoot. I forgot.
Tomorrow is the day we...

01:43.977 --> 01:45.971
scheduled to take Jack

01:45.977 --> 01:48.041
- to have his pictures taken.
- Don't worry about it.

01:48.085 --> 01:50.760
- I'll reschedule.
- No, no, no. Go ahead and take him,

01:50.786 --> 01:52.632
and I'll do my best
to be there, okay ?

01:52.647 --> 01:54.722
Just come back safely.

01:57.528 --> 01:58.893
I will.

02:00.695 --> 02:01.513
Bye.

02:09.048 --> 02:11.030
Everybody, meet agent Prentiss.

02:11.045 --> 02:13.693
The other day. I've been filling her
in on protocol.

02:14.026 --> 02:15.802
- Derek Morgan.
- Emily Prentiss.

02:15.815 --> 02:18.071
We can make nice later.
What do we know ?

02:18.087 --> 02:20.892
The DEA raided what they thought
was a hardened meth lab

02:20.905 --> 02:22.631
right here, in Northern Virginia,

02:22.737 --> 02:24.933
but they found this instead.

02:27.497 --> 02:30.022
That could be a dispersal device
for a chemical weapon.

02:30.038 --> 02:32.850
- Sophisticated.
- Homeland security's thinking Al Qaeda.

02:32.867 --> 02:35.722
They've developed devices that span
the spectrum of sophistication,

02:35.736 --> 02:38.182
some as simple as soda
bottles and paint cans.

02:38.197 --> 02:39.902
They're called al ikhteraa.

02:39.907 --> 02:41.742
Literally "the invention".

02:42.288 --> 02:43.393
They are.

02:43.568 --> 02:46.553
Do we know what the biological
or chemical agent is yet ?

02:46.568 --> 02:48.141
No, not yet.

02:48.156 --> 02:49.941
The cell members bailed
out through a tunnel.

02:49.957 --> 02:52.053
The DEA recovered a nextel 2-way

02:52.058 --> 02:53.973
and managed to intercept a message.

02:54.708 --> 02:57.693
- That's not the transcript. It's...
- No, it's in arabic.

02:58.815 --> 03:01.723
Our friends surprised us
and eloped.

03:01.726 --> 03:04.043
We can no longer
wait for the wedding

03:04.055 --> 03:05.450
as planned.

03:05.468 --> 03:07.791
We can deliver our gift

03:07.808 --> 03:09.672
at the next crescent.

03:13.788 --> 03:17.000
I lived in several
middle-eastern countries

03:17.048 --> 03:19.333
- growing up.
- Next crescent ?

03:19.345 --> 03:21.791
Muslims sometimes
use a lunar calendar.

03:21.805 --> 03:24.503
- I'd have to look it up...
- Next crescent moon is in two days.

03:24.618 --> 03:27.573
So whatever they're attacking,
it's happening in less than 48 hours.

03:27.587 --> 03:28.980
That sounds like it, sir.

03:28.987 --> 03:31.430
Payment for the nextel
is linked to this man.

03:32.086 --> 03:33.280
Jind Allah.

03:33.286 --> 03:35.561
Literally "soldier of God".

03:35.566 --> 03:38.531
That's pretty poor operational
security for a sophisticated plot.

03:38.598 --> 03:41.313
Two months ago, Jind Allah
was captured leaving the U.S.

03:41.328 --> 03:43.043
Using a forged pakistani passport

03:43.057 --> 03:45.040
via Richmond international airport.

03:45.055 --> 03:47.791
He's been held as a ghost detainee
in Guantanamo Bay ever since.

03:47.807 --> 03:49.573
So technically, he doesn't exist.

03:49.585 --> 03:51.450
Soldier of God isn't a name.

03:51.465 --> 03:54.353
No, it's most likely a name
taken on for the Jihad,

03:54.558 --> 03:55.900
meaning struggle.

03:55.918 --> 03:58.171
Extremists claim it's a holy war.

03:58.188 --> 04:01.072
Yet the words "holy" and "war"
never appear together in the Qu'ran.

04:01.228 --> 04:03.432
- Do we know his real name ?
- CIA interrogators

04:03.447 --> 04:06.283
- have gotten nothing out of the guy.
- They need us to break him.

04:06.297 --> 04:09.332
We do know from past intercepts
that he's a recruiter.

04:09.388 --> 04:10.893
He came into this country

04:10.906 --> 04:12.652
to assemble the omega cell,

04:12.667 --> 04:14.500
a sleeper cell with
an unknown mission.

04:14.505 --> 04:16.300
We have 48 hours to do
what the CIA

04:16.315 --> 04:18.010
hasn't been able to manage
in two months.

04:18.015 --> 04:20.103
We could be looking at
the first attack on our soil

04:20.115 --> 04:21.839
since 9/11.

04:27.938 --> 04:31.843

04:48.195 --> 04:54.172
La team BAU pour www.forom.com et
http ://experts.heberg-forum.net

05:02.085 --> 05:04.471
- Hey.
- Car here ? I told Reid 5 minutes.

05:04.475 --> 05:06.603
I think you should take Prentiss
with you to Guantanamo.

05:06.615 --> 05:08.252
- Excuse me ?
- She could be of help.

05:08.277 --> 05:10.161
I don't know enough
about her abilities.

05:10.168 --> 05:12.741
- There's plenty for her to do back here.
- I don't know what she's capable of either,

05:12.756 --> 05:14.551
but we've got to find out
sooner or later.

05:14.566 --> 05:16.620
It's an interrogation,
not a training exercise.

05:16.626 --> 05:18.823
She's the only member of
the team fluent in arabic.

05:18.838 --> 05:21.623
- There are other translators.
- Yeah, but they haven't studied behavior.

05:21.657 --> 05:23.102
She ever have her ready bag yet ?

05:23.115 --> 05:26.201
My guess is there isn't much
this woman's unprepared for.

05:33.616 --> 05:35.673
Car leaves in 4 minutes.

05:35.878 --> 05:37.063
Yes, sir.

05:41.375 --> 05:42.870
<i>Dale Turner mused :</i>

05:42.986 --> 05:44.592
<i>"Some of the best lessons
are learned</i>

05:44.607 --> 05:46.211
<i>from past mistakes.</i>

05:46.315 --> 05:47.930
<i>The error of the past</i>

05:47.948 --> 05:49.990
<i>is the wisdom of the future."</i>

05:54.648 --> 05:56.190
Excuse me, sir.

05:56.198 --> 05:58.530
I just wanted to let you know
how much I appreciate...

05:58.536 --> 06:00.171
do not thank me.

06:02.058 --> 06:04.212
- Sir ?
- It's not a favor.

06:04.645 --> 06:07.492
- Of course. I know that.
- You're coming to do a job.

06:11.517 --> 06:14.442
Do you think the interrogation
of Jind Allah will work in time ?

06:15.015 --> 06:17.543
Interrogation's the most
dynamic form of profiling.

06:17.755 --> 06:19.631
That's not an answer.

06:20.677 --> 06:21.413
Sir.

06:24.825 --> 06:26.512
He's been locked away in Gitmo.

06:26.528 --> 06:28.380
He doesn't know we raided
the cell's safe house.

06:28.397 --> 06:29.863
That's an advantage for us.

06:29.877 --> 06:32.651
The main thing is to get
him talking about anything.

06:33.127 --> 06:35.591
Then his language and body
movements will betray him.

06:41.507 --> 06:44.012
It's like this - you focus on the way
your opponent holds his piece.

06:44.026 --> 06:47.333
How quickly and firmly he places it.
Then you watch his face and body.

06:47.717 --> 06:49.580
It'll telegraph a player's strategy,

06:49.597 --> 06:51.473
his... training,

06:52.357 --> 06:54.442
maybe his motivations.

06:54.455 --> 06:57.330
- Is that what you need us to do ?
- No. I need you to listen.

06:57.958 --> 06:59.553
You're fluent in arabic.

06:59.568 --> 07:01.623
I won't know the nuances like you.

07:01.638 --> 07:03.653
Every word, every phrase.

07:03.668 --> 07:06.663
Be on the lookout for subtext,

07:07.048 --> 07:09.182
ulterior meanings.

07:09.668 --> 07:11.983
- What do you want me to do ?
- I want you to watch for tells.

07:11.986 --> 07:14.271
Non-verbals, micro-expressions.

07:14.275 --> 07:16.372
Watch him when he's
comfortable and relaxed,

07:16.386 --> 07:19.473
then note the behavioral changes
when he's under stress.

07:19.906 --> 07:22.773
If we can establish a baseline,
we'll be able to read him

07:22.786 --> 07:25.050
once I challenge his belief systems.

07:25.456 --> 07:28.291
Before I can get him to give up
where or how they'll attack,

07:28.305 --> 07:31.171
I'll first have to cause him
to reveal something of himself.

07:36.106 --> 07:38.401
- Game over.
- What are you talking about ?

07:47.155 --> 07:49.940
Gitmo's runway is perpendicular
to cuban airspace,

07:49.973 --> 07:52.289
so approaching aircraft
have to negotiate a...

07:52.290 --> 07:55.340
last minute 90 degree
right turn in order to land.

07:55.824 --> 07:57.728
They call it the Gitmo twist.

07:57.729 --> 08:01.022
- I was winning.
- Actually, he would have had you in 3.

08:06.526 --> 08:08.002
- Bonnie Ryan.
- Aaron Hotchner.

08:08.088 --> 08:11.141
- DEA team. We ran this raid.
- Derek Morgan.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.232
This must have slowed
you down some ?

08:13.246 --> 08:15.621
Hell enough for them to get
out through the tunnel.

08:15.638 --> 08:17.922
They must have done escape drills.

08:21.418 --> 08:24.042
- Hey, Morgan.
- Hey, Kenny. Been a minute, man.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.090
Yeah.

08:25.106 --> 08:26.722
- We good in here ?
- Yeah,

08:26.737 --> 08:29.332
don't worry about it.
Everything's been rendered safe.

08:30.476 --> 08:32.490
These guys weren't messing around.

08:34.008 --> 08:35.072
Hotch,

08:35.168 --> 08:38.403
these tubes surround what
would be the explosive charge.

08:38.725 --> 08:41.082
And this cylinder right here ?

08:41.666 --> 08:44.140
It's gotta be where they put
whatever bio or chem agent

08:44.155 --> 08:45.703
they plan on dispersing.

08:45.717 --> 08:48.622
- That's a happy thought.
- Yeah. Tell me about it.

08:49.798 --> 08:51.802
Looks like a 4 man cell.

08:54.066 --> 08:56.022
They assimilated
into the community.

08:56.137 --> 08:59.351
Just like any other suburban gangster
wannabes rolling at the mall.

08:59.366 --> 09:00.910
Who do you think we're dealing with ?

09:00.917 --> 09:03.763
Most likely middle-eastern males
in their early twenties.

09:03.778 --> 09:06.771
Judging by that device out there,
they're looking at significant targets :

09:06.788 --> 09:09.380
Military installations,
government buildings.

09:38.365 --> 09:40.392
You must be the BAU boys.

09:40.708 --> 09:42.343
And gal. Pardon me.

09:42.385 --> 09:44.803
- I'm Jason Gideon.
- Andy Bingaman, FBI.

09:44.816 --> 09:46.620
- Agent Prentiss, Dr. Reid.
- Hi.

09:46.648 --> 09:48.760
I'm the intelligence
supervisor here at Gitmo.

09:48.777 --> 09:50.972
You guys having a hard time
getting Jind Allah to talk ?

09:50.988 --> 09:52.541
Not only can't they get him
to budge, but 2 weeks ago,

09:52.558 --> 09:55.661
word got out that one of the other
detainees was spilling secrets.

09:56.666 --> 09:58.610
Jind Allah managed to have
a 3 minute conversation

09:58.625 --> 10:00.120
with him in the shower line.

10:00.178 --> 10:03.122
That night, the other
detainee committed suicide.

10:07.855 --> 10:10.751
He's reciting the
Qu'ran from memory.

10:10.755 --> 10:12.463
He's most likely a hafez.

10:12.476 --> 10:14.931
He must have done it a dozen times
since he's come to this facility.

10:14.938 --> 10:17.402
Some muslim children are
able to do it since age 12.

10:17.498 --> 10:20.961
Two months of interrogation, that's all
the CIA's been able to get out of him.

10:21.236 --> 10:23.840
There are cuts and bruises
under his right eye socket.

10:23.848 --> 10:25.511
What kind of tactics are they using ?

10:25.525 --> 10:27.531
I control the actions
to the detainees,

10:27.548 --> 10:30.502
but I can assure you, my protest
about their methods has been ignored.

10:30.517 --> 10:32.862
Let the interrogation 
proceed normally.

10:32.946 --> 10:35.502
I'm gonna interrupt and
demand they stop harassing.

10:35.515 --> 10:36.961
Maybe I should tell them in advance.

10:36.978 --> 10:38.682
No, it's better if they don't expect it.

10:38.688 --> 10:41.693
The reaction will be more
visceral, more believable.

10:42.745 --> 10:45.751
- Go ahead with phase 2 as planned.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

10:50.777 --> 10:52.793
You really gonna put a show on
for these guys ?

10:52.806 --> 10:54.941
No, no for them.

10:55.198 --> 10:56.643
For Jind Allah.

10:58.448 --> 11:00.472
He's needs to see me
as a complete contrast

11:00.476 --> 11:02.893
to what he's come to expect
from his captors.

11:03.257 --> 11:05.261
It's the best way to jump
start him into talking.

11:05.276 --> 11:07.370
We have less than 36 hours.

11:07.607 --> 11:08.931
Have at it.

11:08.945 --> 11:10.362
You two ready ?

11:10.777 --> 11:12.881
- Yeah, this way.
- Thank you.

11:13.547 --> 11:15.113
Do you understand ?

11:15.125 --> 11:17.072
Every day...

11:20.288 --> 11:21.553
who the hell are you ?

11:21.556 --> 11:23.973
Supervisory special agent
Jason Gideon.

11:23.976 --> 11:25.982
I'm an FBI behavioral analyst.

11:26.108 --> 11:28.170
It's time to show this
man some respect.

11:28.607 --> 11:29.862
You gotta be kidding me.

11:29.867 --> 11:32.153
You have orders from
agent Bingaman to leave

11:32.168 --> 11:34.813
so I can speak
with this detainee alone.

11:57.935 --> 12:00.570
I'm sorry for the
treatment you've suffered.

12:01.697 --> 12:04.300
If you don't mind, I'd like to
spend some time with you.

12:10.266 --> 12:11.943
He stopped his recitation.

12:12.846 --> 12:14.582
He's sizing Gideon up.

12:18.716 --> 12:20.391
If I don't mind ?

12:21.368 --> 12:23.572
Like to get to know you
as a person.

12:23.587 --> 12:25.080
Your faith,

12:25.215 --> 12:26.610
your ideology.

12:26.626 --> 12:28.291
To what end ?

12:28.767 --> 12:30.992
Studying human behavior
is what I do.

12:33.955 --> 12:37.001
if these guys are fundamentalists,
you'd think they'd have Qu'rans,

12:37.015 --> 12:39.891
- prayer mats.
- No. We didn't find any of that here.

12:40.067 --> 12:42.431
They must have at least
one other location.

12:48.368 --> 12:49.563
Ryan,

12:49.867 --> 12:51.633
- Hotch.
- What is it ?

12:51.637 --> 12:53.733
That looks like a
list of chemicals.

12:54.316 --> 12:56.193
Let me check with Garcia.

12:56.728 --> 12:58.103
- Go, doll.
<i>- Hey,</i>

12:58.117 --> 12:59.852
<i>I'm gonna read off a list to you.</i>

12:59.867 --> 13:01.253
<i>These are chemicals.</i>

13:01.628 --> 13:03.272
I'd like to believe,

13:03.975 --> 13:06.411
with greater understanding
one day,

13:07.347 --> 13:10.350
we can come to a peaceful
resolution of our differences.

13:12.258 --> 13:13.633
Is that so ?

13:14.657 --> 13:17.403
Look, I don't know what you've done
or what you may have planned to do.

13:25.297 --> 13:27.591
But unlike the other detainees here,

13:29.016 --> 13:32.180
you have the education,
intelligence to convey

13:32.195 --> 13:34.273
the nuances of your culture.

13:34.288 --> 13:36.230
That's what interests me.

13:36.247 --> 13:39.243
Until, I don't give you what you want.

13:40.016 --> 13:43.310
Then you will resort
to other tactics.

13:43.756 --> 13:46.653
I swore an oath to uphold
the United States constitution,

13:47.355 --> 13:49.693
no matter where I am,
no matter

13:49.707 --> 13:52.152
who I deal with.

13:55.938 --> 13:56.921
You're sure ?

13:58.985 --> 14:00.000
All right.

14:01.898 --> 14:03.753
- What'd she say ?
- Garcia says this looks like

14:03.766 --> 14:06.890
a list of additives needed
to weaponize anthrax.

14:18.385 --> 14:20.502
Could they get enough anthrax ?

14:20.635 --> 14:23.022
The letter sent to senator
Tom Daschle's office in 2002

14:23.038 --> 14:25.331
only contained two grams
of purified spores,

14:25.557 --> 14:28.733
enough to kill 25 million people
if effectively distributed.

14:29.725 --> 14:31.853
<i>Are you willing
to have a chat with me ?</i>

14:31.866 --> 14:33.362
<i>Go ahead. Gideon.</i>

14:33.375 --> 14:34.423
<i>Let's chat.</i>

14:34.437 --> 14:36.701
He's from Egypt. Cairo.

14:36.706 --> 14:38.411
- You sure ?
- No,

14:38.426 --> 14:40.743
he could be yemeni,
but odds are he's egyptian.

14:40.755 --> 14:42.813
<i>What type of name is Gideon ?</i>

14:42.908 --> 14:44.233
American.

14:44.238 --> 14:46.283
I often forget that in your culture,

14:46.295 --> 14:49.340
you put your country first
and your god last.

14:49.676 --> 14:52.662
Sir, he was born and raised in egypt.

14:52.678 --> 14:54.963
They pronounce "J" sounds as a "G".

14:54.975 --> 14:57.851
You don't consider yourself
egyptian as well as muslim ?

14:57.857 --> 15:00.720
Egyptian.
In two minutes,

15:00.735 --> 15:03.630
you know more about me
than those thugs

15:03.648 --> 15:06.100
found out in two months.

15:06.215 --> 15:07.643
They and I have...

15:07.705 --> 15:10.640
very, very different motives
and methodologies.

15:11.127 --> 15:13.141
And yet your country

15:13.158 --> 15:15.671
relies on them to protect you

15:16.056 --> 15:17.131
from us.

15:17.146 --> 15:19.233
Sometimes they're
their own worst enemy.

15:19.248 --> 15:22.240
Yeah. Who is your worst
enemy, agent Gideon ?

15:23.316 --> 15:24.752
It's not a who.

15:24.917 --> 15:26.321
It's a what.

15:27.247 --> 15:28.553
Ignorance.

15:30.135 --> 15:31.881
You're a very honest man.

15:31.888 --> 15:33.380
And you ?

15:35.277 --> 15:37.213
Must have become a hafez by what,

15:37.327 --> 15:39.380
- age 10 ?
- 9.

15:39.537 --> 15:41.652
Any person with the discipline
and dedication

15:41.668 --> 15:44.703
to memorize the entire Qu'ran
by age 9

15:46.187 --> 15:49.343
must have a very serious reason
to choose a life of violence.

15:49.857 --> 15:51.073
Perhaps.

15:54.246 --> 15:55.881
We are through already ?

15:56.045 --> 15:57.691
No, not at all.

15:58.036 --> 15:59.702
The sun is about to set.

15:59.705 --> 16:01.891
Mecca's in that direction.

16:02.338 --> 16:04.791
I'll have a prayer rug
and water bowl sent in.

16:12.375 --> 16:14.070
What the heck is going on here ?

16:14.088 --> 16:17.451
The NSA is routing all messages
to us for language analysis.

16:17.485 --> 16:20.200
You know, rumor has it,
much to my chagrin,

16:20.216 --> 16:22.273
that during national
security emergencies,

16:22.288 --> 16:25.130
our fair country turns
all of its satellites homeward

16:25.148 --> 16:28.241
and records all electronic traffic
in the whole U. S. A.

16:28.865 --> 16:30.231
Is this even legal ?

16:30.246 --> 16:32.511
Yeah, I don't really want
to think about that right now.

16:32.727 --> 16:35.081
Somewhere in this slew of chatter
could be a shred of something

16:35.098 --> 16:37.300
that could save
a whole lot of lives.

16:37.365 --> 16:40.302
All right, well,
cross reference gift

16:40.315 --> 16:41.931
with wedding allusions.

16:41.946 --> 16:43.981
They'll be consistent with their code.

16:44.718 --> 16:46.110
Here's something.

16:46.127 --> 16:48.881
It rained all over the wedding,
but the gift is waiting in the barn.

16:48.885 --> 16:51.720
- When was that call made ?
- Looks like just over two hours ago.

16:51.737 --> 16:54.651
Let's run the words
"barn and "wedding" through.

16:57.116 --> 17:00.171
The wedding will now be held at
Vincent's barn off Link and Annandale.

17:00.176 --> 17:02.772
- Wrap the gift for delivery.
- That's not a gift I wanna get.

17:02.787 --> 17:04.652
I'll call Hotch.

17:04.897 --> 17:05.862
Yeah, JJ.

17:05.876 --> 17:07.940
We think we just found the
cell's backup location.

17:07.957 --> 17:11.440
It looks like a construction
site in Annandale, Virginia.

17:11.446 --> 17:14.561
Sounds like they may have
another device ready to arm.

17:14.578 --> 17:17.651
I'll get agent ryan to organize another
raid. And notify Gideon and Reid.

17:17.666 --> 17:18.782
<i>Okay.</i>

17:19.494 --> 17:20.982
Can I offer you some water ?

17:21.298 --> 17:23.321
I offer you some first.

17:36.938 --> 17:40.112
They only kept it there to
show me what I could not have.

17:43.378 --> 17:45.382
I'd like you to explain something to me.

17:46.368 --> 17:48.411
How can you ignore the fact

17:48.628 --> 17:50.582
that Muhammad preached passivity

17:50.597 --> 17:52.452
while he was in Mecca ?

17:52.887 --> 17:54.300
"Do no violence".

17:54.315 --> 17:57.711
His later message from medina
was perfectly clear.

17:58.446 --> 18:01.293
"When violence come upon you,

18:01.727 --> 18:04.150
you must fight back with violence.

18:04.157 --> 18:05.943
He's quoting from the
Hadith, not from the Qu'ran.

18:05.957 --> 18:07.622
It's called the verse of the sword.

18:07.628 --> 18:09.681
They argue that it cancels
out earlier teachings.

18:09.698 --> 18:11.291
Verse of the sword.

18:11.305 --> 18:13.912
Just someone's spin
on the words of the prophet.

18:14.407 --> 18:16.502
It's not even part of the Qu'ran.

18:18.457 --> 18:21.012
But it does say in the Qu'ran

18:21.036 --> 18:23.292
fight and slay the infidels

18:23.307 --> 18:24.951
wherever you find them

18:24.965 --> 18:28.273
and seize them
in every stratagem of war.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.492
Unless they repent.

18:30.907 --> 18:33.163
Establish regular prayers

18:33.727 --> 18:36.083
and practice regular charity.

18:36.537 --> 18:38.603
Is it your intention, Mr. Gideon,

18:38.607 --> 18:41.753
to become a man of faith
and revert to islam ?

18:41.855 --> 18:43.522
I am a man of faith.

18:44.938 --> 18:46.480
I have repented,

18:46.485 --> 18:48.190
I pray regularly,

18:48.195 --> 18:49.913
and I practice charity.

18:50.976 --> 18:53.591
I have never committed
violence against you,

18:53.708 --> 18:56.362
so how is it that my faith
would allow you

18:56.378 --> 18:58.322
to live and worship as you please,

18:58.336 --> 19:01.410
and yours would take
my life and snuff it out ?

19:01.426 --> 19:05.072
You are simply misguided
people of the book.

19:05.076 --> 19:08.620
- But if you revert to islam...
- A billion muslims.

19:09.115 --> 19:11.860
one billion muslims

19:12.178 --> 19:15.443
manage to practice
their faith in peace...

19:16.707 --> 19:20.032
for Allah is surely merciful.

19:23.008 --> 19:23.930
You...

19:25.126 --> 19:27.953
inquired about my childhood earlier.

19:29.426 --> 19:31.143
I will tell you...

19:32.235 --> 19:34.223
that it was a happy one

19:35.225 --> 19:36.532
until...

19:37.058 --> 19:38.410
one day...

19:38.446 --> 19:41.743
a bomb fell out of the sky

19:42.187 --> 19:44.962
and leveled the bazaar
that I was in

19:44.968 --> 19:47.452
with my family.

19:48.857 --> 19:51.941
I was only 8.

19:52.836 --> 19:55.471
Must have been horrifying
for such a young boy.

19:56.318 --> 19:58.032
He's opening
up about himself.

19:58.046 --> 19:59.481
Maybe.

19:59.526 --> 20:02.152
We need to verify
what he's saying, though.

20:02.665 --> 20:03.640
Speak.

20:03.656 --> 20:05.300
<i>Garcia, I need you to
check something for me.</i>

20:05.306 --> 20:08.362
I'm looking for a stray bombing
in a bazaar somewhere in Egypt

20:08.378 --> 20:10.682
approximately 30 years ago.

20:10.927 --> 20:12.803
Okay, great.
That's not too obscure.

20:12.815 --> 20:14.172
<i>I don't need you to give me details.</i>

20:14.187 --> 20:17.022
We're just trying to set a baseline
for Jind Allah's truthfulness.

20:17.025 --> 20:20.043
- I need to know if it happened at all.
<i>- When I know, you'll know.</i>

20:20.055 --> 20:22.921
- Thank you.
<i>- When the rubble was cleared...</i>

20:25.467 --> 20:26.932
half...

20:28.078 --> 20:30.021
of my family was dead.

20:31.477 --> 20:33.381
It was on that day

20:33.398 --> 20:35.831
that I swore my life to vengeance

20:35.847 --> 20:37.322
for Allah.

20:39.075 --> 20:41.042
And for that very reason,

20:42.466 --> 20:45.030
those holding you here
can never let you leave.

20:47.427 --> 20:49.612
Your only hope is to tell me

20:49.775 --> 20:51.811
so I can hopefully one day

20:51.825 --> 20:54.151
share your struggle
with the world.

20:55.656 --> 20:57.290
Your government

20:57.476 --> 21:00.990
won't even admit that I exist.

21:02.517 --> 21:04.221
How possibly

21:04.948 --> 21:07.951
can you tell
my side of the story ?

21:12.458 --> 21:14.702
Hey, guys, we want silence
tonight. No coms.

21:14.715 --> 21:16.600
Let's be careful.
We don't know what to expect.

21:16.618 --> 21:18.852
- Ready ?
- Ready. Let's do it.

21:39.565 --> 21:40.831
Clear !

21:47.958 --> 21:50.713
This place is completely empty.
We missed them again.

21:50.837 --> 21:52.810
You got Gideon, Prentiss, and me.

21:52.827 --> 21:55.651
<i>It's Hotch. We're at cell location
number 2. No cell members,</i>

21:55.696 --> 21:57.870
no lab, no dispersal devices.

21:57.876 --> 21:59.650
<i>We're still looking
for escape tunnels.</i>

21:59.666 --> 22:01.020
Call us.

22:01.235 --> 22:04.172
We're running out of time. The attack's
supposed to take place in less than 24 hours.

22:04.187 --> 22:07.062
So getting Jind Allah to talk is
our only chance of finding them.

22:07.066 --> 22:09.722
- Time I confronted him with the truth.
- What are you going to do ?

22:09.735 --> 22:11.373
Show him my hand.

22:17.708 --> 22:20.720
I'm going to give you the respect
of telling you what just happened.

22:20.928 --> 22:23.700
A team of agents raided
an omega cell location.

22:24.156 --> 22:26.020
Actually, both of them.

22:26.818 --> 22:29.921
Our men are in place
in Annandale as we speak.

22:31.225 --> 22:34.072
You gain nothing by remaining silent.

22:34.998 --> 22:37.352
Jihad is forever.

22:37.668 --> 22:40.162
Something's wrong.
His hands.

22:42.367 --> 22:45.873
Gideon, something's wrong. This guy
seemed relieved by what you just told him.

22:46.725 --> 22:48.150
Excuse me.

22:54.308 --> 22:55.972
- What's the problem ?
- Get everybody out of there.

22:55.986 --> 22:58.240
- Now ! Now ! Now !
- Everybody out.

22:58.246 --> 22:59.873
It's a trap.
Now !

22:59.926 --> 23:02.230
I said out !
Go !

23:28.105 --> 23:30.690
How did a terror cell
get its hands on anthrax

23:30.707 --> 23:33.323
without a single lab
reporting a security breach ?

23:33.337 --> 23:35.231
Would we know if a foreign lab
had a breach ?

23:35.248 --> 23:36.832
A foreign lab ?

23:36.848 --> 23:39.220
Actually, no.

23:40.626 --> 23:41.641
Garcia,

23:42.126 --> 23:44.783
isn't Annandale where
Morgan and Hotch are ?

23:46.838 --> 23:49.070
That's not a gas main explosion.

23:51.798 --> 23:53.233
Please pick up.

23:53.248 --> 23:55.090
Please pick up. Please pick up.

23:59.188 --> 24:00.652
Yeah, it's Morgan.

24:00.778 --> 24:03.323
<i>Hello ? Garcia, can you hear me ?</i>

24:03.327 --> 24:05.581
We saw the explosion on TV.

24:05.598 --> 24:07.700
Yeah, I know.
We lost a S.W.A.T. agent.

24:07.866 --> 24:09.230
Oh, God.

24:09.685 --> 24:12.632
Don't worry. Don't think you're
gonna get rid of me that easy.

24:13.995 --> 24:15.641
Do you need anything ?

24:16.026 --> 24:18.432
I know who to call if I do.
Thanks, baby doll.

24:20.156 --> 24:21.600
They're all right ?

24:21.878 --> 24:22.670
Yeah.

24:23.895 --> 24:25.822
We lost a S.W.A.T. agent.

24:37.885 --> 24:39.570
Son of a bitch.

24:39.635 --> 24:41.203
Sorry about Kenny.

24:41.215 --> 24:43.220
Yeah, me, too.

24:43.718 --> 24:46.181
The chatter was a set-up.
They knew we'd be listening.

24:46.185 --> 24:47.700
They led us straight here.

24:47.917 --> 24:50.240
Just tell me you know
where to look next.

24:50.885 --> 24:52.350
Not yet.

24:56.547 --> 24:57.743
They're okay ?

24:57.755 --> 24:59.523
We were right about the trap.

24:59.735 --> 25:01.201
It was rigged to explode.

25:01.208 --> 25:02.680
A S.W.A.T. agent was killed.

25:02.695 --> 25:05.120
- Was anthrax involved ?
- No.

25:05.488 --> 25:07.461
Then that's not the final target.

25:17.177 --> 25:19.383
You look troubled, my friend.

25:20.555 --> 25:22.511
You killed one of my men.

25:22.577 --> 25:24.072
I was here with you.

25:24.087 --> 25:26.201
The second location was a trap.

25:27.577 --> 25:30.332
One of my agents was
killed in the explosion.

25:30.377 --> 25:31.913
This is war.

25:32.978 --> 25:35.181
We expect casualties.

25:35.887 --> 25:37.271
Shouldn't you ?

25:37.276 --> 25:39.502
- He was a good man.
- Well...

25:40.055 --> 25:41.752
if he would convert,

25:42.387 --> 25:45.180
there would be no reason
for him to fear death.

25:45.387 --> 25:47.801
What do you say to his family ?

25:56.355 --> 25:57.733
I say :

25:59.255 --> 26:00.471
Where...

26:01.707 --> 26:03.513
were you to mourn...

26:06.027 --> 26:08.161
when my son was murdered ?

26:08.165 --> 26:10.851
- His son ?
- Did you see that ?

26:11.245 --> 26:12.713
When he told the story
about his childhood,

26:12.717 --> 26:15.263
the bomb landing in the
bazaar, his behavior changed.

26:15.277 --> 26:18.483
We know he was lying. Garcia couldn't
find any record of a bombing

26:18.497 --> 26:20.152
during the time Jind Allah
was a boy.

26:20.167 --> 26:22.963
Exactly, but this time when he mentioned
his son, he looked at his hands,

26:22.978 --> 26:25.971
like he had to concentrate
to control his anger.

26:26.237 --> 26:28.371
That first story wasn't about him.

26:28.386 --> 26:30.153
It was about his son.

26:30.165 --> 26:33.141
Which means it must
have been more recent.

26:33.968 --> 26:34.670
Garcia.

26:34.686 --> 26:36.522
<i>I need you to look for a
bombing again in Egypt,</i>

26:36.528 --> 26:38.712
<i>but this time anything
in the last ten years.</i>

26:38.728 --> 26:39.440
On it.

26:39.445 --> 26:42.030
<i>We're looking for civilian
casualties, an 8-year-old boy.</i>

26:42.035 --> 26:44.271
Okay. I'm cross referencing bombings

26:44.275 --> 26:46.151
and child victims.

26:47.798 --> 26:49.623
Seven years ago,
in the heart of Cairo,

26:49.636 --> 26:51.873
egyptian government
blamed Hezbollah, but

26:51.885 --> 26:54.923
conspiracy theories on the street
claimed it was a joint U. S-Israli strike

26:54.925 --> 26:56.963
that went astray.

26:57.716 --> 27:00.460
Your ghost detainee's name
is Jamal Abaza.

27:00.466 --> 27:02.630
<i>How about his son's name ?
Do you have that ?</i>

27:02.645 --> 27:04.583
Amir Abaza. 8. Killed in the blast.

27:04.587 --> 27:07.663
All right. Find out everything you
can on that. I'll get back to you soon.

27:09.197 --> 27:10.923
We know his real identity.

27:10.935 --> 27:13.653
It appears that there will be no

27:13.666 --> 27:16.403
peaceful resolution
to our difficulties after all.

27:16.418 --> 27:18.782
I haven't given up that hope.

27:20.348 --> 27:23.243
It's time for your
Salut-ul-Isha prayers.

27:24.516 --> 27:26.271
May we speak again tomorrow ?

27:26.286 --> 27:27.750
You are asking me ?

27:27.766 --> 27:28.673
Yes.

27:30.196 --> 27:31.740
Tomorrow, then.

27:38.336 --> 27:40.451
Jamal Abaza's been
in the U.S. for a while.

27:40.465 --> 27:43.210
He volunteered as the prison imam
at the Dearfield correctional center

27:43.226 --> 27:45.803
- three years ago.
- How could the CIA not know that ?

27:45.817 --> 27:47.940
They're focused overseas.
We're domestic.

27:47.955 --> 27:50.602
Yeah. They probably sent a request
for a domestic information search,

27:50.616 --> 27:52.462
and it's somewhere making
its way through channels.

27:52.475 --> 27:56.652
If he was a prison imam, he must have
recruited militant islamic society members.

27:57.728 --> 28:00.223
M.I.S. Is an atypical
prison organization.

28:00.515 --> 28:02.913
They pick up an amalgam
of ethnicities.

28:04.008 --> 28:05.341
<i>The Qu'ran says...</i>

28:06.496 --> 28:07.912
<i>that my lord...</i>

28:07.925 --> 28:10.581
this fool knows
that slip through the cracks,

28:10.598 --> 28:14.121
the ones that traditional
groups won't accept.

28:14.127 --> 28:17.741
<i>Outside these walls,
you need to understand...</i>

28:17.796 --> 28:20.670
It's made up largely of
american citizens.

28:21.996 --> 28:23.721
American citizens with

28:23.736 --> 28:26.100
a reason for hating the government.

28:26.105 --> 28:28.940
We're looking at
home grown terrorists.

28:35.415 --> 28:37.512
- What the hell do you want ?
- The name jamal abaza.

28:37.528 --> 28:38.831
Does it mean anything to you ?

28:38.845 --> 28:42.301
Abaza was an imam in Cairo.
He preached Jihad to his followers,

28:42.315 --> 28:44.472
but he fell off the grid
seven years ago.

28:44.488 --> 28:47.002
That's because when his son died,
he took the Jihad name :

28:47.208 --> 28:48.622
Jind Allah.

28:48.635 --> 28:51.491
He came to America
to recruit sleeper cells.

28:51.765 --> 28:54.510
You're telling us that that
detainee in there is Jamal Abaza ?

28:54.516 --> 28:56.413
Amazing what you learn
when you talk to people.

28:56.428 --> 28:58.773
He was also a prison imam
in Virginia three years ago.

28:58.787 --> 29:01.183
Are you familiar with the
militant islamic society ?

29:01.197 --> 29:02.371
They're home grown ?

29:02.387 --> 29:05.171
We know the cell that abaza put
together has access to anthrax,

29:05.186 --> 29:08.482
but we can't find any reports of
any going missing in the States.

29:08.737 --> 29:11.122
We have protocols that
we have to follow.

29:11.488 --> 29:14.840
You really going to allow a terrorist
attack on U.S. soil because of protocols ?

29:18.787 --> 29:21.640
I told you what I learned in
there because you and I, FBI, CIA,

29:21.656 --> 29:23.111
right now we have the ability

29:23.127 --> 29:26.140
to break through all the protocol
and share information.

29:28.207 --> 29:29.552
Let me see what we have.

29:29.555 --> 29:32.491
Coordinate with agent Jareau
and Penelope Garcia at Quantico.

29:32.575 --> 29:33.853
Please.

29:36.195 --> 29:38.181
- Think it'll work ?
- I don't know.

29:38.538 --> 29:41.371
CIA's tough. They play it
pretty close to the vest.

29:41.817 --> 29:45.222
Well, if we don't all work together,
more people are gonna die.

29:45.296 --> 29:46.961
A lot more.

29:51.905 --> 29:55.270
- How goes with the CIA ?
- I don't know what Gideon said to them,

29:55.287 --> 29:58.520
but they are feeding me
information like crazy.

29:58.528 --> 30:00.863
- They sure do generate intelligence.
- Yeah.

30:00.878 --> 30:03.302
Hopefully not too much to interpret.

30:13.188 --> 30:14.431
Slept well ?

30:14.656 --> 30:16.541
For the first time
since I've been here.

30:16.546 --> 30:17.621
Good.

30:17.986 --> 30:19.642
Until yesterday,

30:20.296 --> 30:22.651
I was not permitted
regular prayer.

30:23.307 --> 30:25.271
We receive comfort
from our prayers.

30:25.348 --> 30:27.791
- We ?
- Human beings.

30:29.125 --> 30:30.501
I say something wrong ?

30:30.506 --> 30:33.422
You placed us on the same level.

30:34.445 --> 30:37.083
- Aren't we ?
- Well, here...

30:37.297 --> 30:39.692
I am thought of as less than human.

30:39.698 --> 30:41.982
And in your Jihad, I am.

30:43.266 --> 30:44.503
Gideon...

30:46.746 --> 30:49.662
what do you really want from me ?

30:49.986 --> 30:51.862
I already told you.

30:53.218 --> 30:55.071
I want to understand you.

30:55.407 --> 30:57.702
And if that is not possible ?

30:57.726 --> 30:59.653
Then that would be my loss.

31:00.357 --> 31:02.963
It's almost time for your midday
prayers. May I return later ?

31:02.975 --> 31:05.531
- I look forward to it.
- Thank you.

31:09.828 --> 31:12.833
Most of these tips are so new they
haven't even been authenticated yet.

31:13.295 --> 31:16.671
Yeah, but there's nothing in the established
information that's remotely helpful.

31:17.406 --> 31:19.920
Wait a minute. Anthrax.

31:20.146 --> 31:21.921
- What ?
- Genimmune.

31:21.937 --> 31:23.683
A dutch biotech firm reported

31:23.697 --> 31:25.490
that they may have had
a security breach

31:25.506 --> 31:27.640
- involving anthrax last week.
- May have ?

31:27.655 --> 31:30.061
They're still doing a
security and inventory sweep,

31:30.068 --> 31:33.732
but they may be missing up to
20 grams of lab grade anthrax.

31:33.858 --> 31:35.323
20 grams.

31:35.337 --> 31:38.382
Could potentially kill
a quarter billion people.

31:41.146 --> 31:43.431
He seems much calmer
than he was yesterday.

31:43.446 --> 31:46.122
May make any reading of his
body language less accurate.

31:46.127 --> 31:47.142
I know.

31:47.167 --> 31:49.783
- Is that what we want ?
- I hope so.

31:52.688 --> 31:55.582
Well, isn't that
the exact opposite of...

31:57.146 --> 31:59.153
He hopes so ?

31:59.195 --> 32:02.041
We have less than ten hours before
the new crescent moon rises.

32:02.056 --> 32:02.961
Nine.

32:03.795 --> 32:05.001
Aren't you worried ?

32:05.005 --> 32:07.952
I've been with him long
enough to trust him.

32:09.937 --> 32:12.941
CIA is funneling you their
dutch terror watch list.

32:12.957 --> 32:16.142
Ok, I can cross reference that with
any port of entry information we have

32:16.158 --> 32:19.150
as well as customs
and immigration enforcement.

32:19.507 --> 32:21.222
You know, it would sure be a lot easier

32:21.236 --> 32:23.591
if there was a centralization
of all this information.

32:23.598 --> 32:25.671
Oh, dream on, JJ.

32:25.797 --> 32:29.270
No one wants the other kids
peeing in their sand box.

32:31.688 --> 32:35.140
Tariq Muhammad.
Dutch citizen, islamic convert.

32:35.147 --> 32:37.961
Traveled here 4 days ago
under his original name.

32:37.977 --> 32:39.673
Andre Janssen.

32:39.686 --> 32:42.223
And we have the address
he listed on his customs form.

32:42.237 --> 32:43.751
Thank you.

32:43.848 --> 32:45.783
- We just got a lead.
- Got a name ?

32:45.786 --> 32:47.551
And an address.

32:53.047 --> 32:56.233
How does a terrorist cell
exists right here in Mayberry ?

32:56.577 --> 32:58.971
Infrared scanning still
shows no one inside.

32:58.985 --> 33:02.530
We're doing a soft entry in
case it's booby trapped.

33:16.315 --> 33:17.722
Sir, get in here !

33:27.065 --> 33:30.682
We have 5 deceased males
and what looks to be a crude lab,

33:30.696 --> 33:32.781
all shot in the
head execution style.

33:32.998 --> 33:35.270
- Any anthrax on the scene ?
- Only residue.

33:35.287 --> 33:39.490
There's also packing and
tags from 4 new backpacks.

33:39.526 --> 33:41.383
- All right, listen up.
- Backpacks ?

33:41.385 --> 33:43.933
They're already on the move.
We're too late.

34:05.296 --> 34:06.430
Have you finished ?

34:06.448 --> 34:08.362
As you said, the sun is set.

34:08.378 --> 34:09.033
Yes.

34:09.487 --> 34:12.053
I'd like you to meet a
colleague of mine. Dr. Reid.

34:12.056 --> 34:14.032
- May we speak ?
- Of course.

34:14.038 --> 34:16.101
I have a little time.

34:16.436 --> 34:18.291
That was a joke.

34:18.304 --> 34:20.262
I have all the time. Please.

34:20.327 --> 34:21.601
A joke.

34:22.317 --> 34:24.712
- Well, we're making progress.
- Yes,

34:24.717 --> 34:26.891
progress. That is true.

34:27.496 --> 34:30.473
Is there no way for this
thing to end ? This Jihad ?

34:30.487 --> 34:34.330
The Jihad will end
when Allah wills its end.

34:34.344 --> 34:37.141
Then how will you know
that it is Allah's will ?

34:37.155 --> 34:39.161
When the Jihad ends.

34:39.817 --> 34:41.922
I have been lying to you.

34:41.947 --> 34:43.350
Of course you have.

34:43.366 --> 34:46.072
My colleague has been outside

34:46.268 --> 34:48.601
watching us as we talked on monitors.

34:48.614 --> 34:51.562
Watching your body language,
trying to figure you out.

34:51.866 --> 34:53.730
Were you successful ?

34:54.027 --> 34:55.743
Somewhat.

34:56.406 --> 34:58.192
Your name is Jamal Abaza.

34:58.207 --> 35:00.213
Your son Amir was killed in 2003

35:00.228 --> 35:02.842
in the bombing
at the Mahfouz bazaar in Cairo.

35:02.867 --> 35:05.033
Since then, you've been recruiting
M.I.S. members in prison

35:05.047 --> 35:06.632
by convincing them that

35:06.645 --> 35:09.343
U.S. Economic policies are exploiting
third world nations

35:09.357 --> 35:11.820
and turned them into extreme
fundamentalists by promising

35:11.835 --> 35:13.790
a better existence with Allah.

35:13.805 --> 35:15.642
I would say that you were

35:15.708 --> 35:17.842
more than somewhat successful.

35:17.855 --> 35:19.771
But I did not learn

35:19.786 --> 35:22.152
where your M.I.S. cell
was going to make

35:22.168 --> 35:24.853
an anthrax attack in the U.S.

35:24.855 --> 35:26.912
At the new crescent

35:26.966 --> 35:28.000
tonight.

35:28.018 --> 35:29.962
I have no knowledge
of such a thing.

35:29.977 --> 35:32.273
Yes, you do, Mr. Abaza.

35:32.485 --> 35:34.351
And there is still time.

35:36.595 --> 35:37.953
What ?

35:41.076 --> 35:42.612
Are you sure ?

36:10.298 --> 36:11.692
Something has happened ?

36:13.916 --> 36:15.653
How could you ?

36:17.515 --> 36:20.910
You choose to contort islam
into an excuse

36:21.435 --> 36:23.611
for a life of violence.

36:24.758 --> 36:26.921
You have perverted your faith

36:27.935 --> 36:30.182
- to justify murder.
- Now

36:30.567 --> 36:33.433
we are finally chatting, Gideon.

36:33.437 --> 36:36.843
You accuse americans of being
puppeteers of the third world,

36:36.847 --> 36:39.710
yet you used your own
people's faith tonight

36:40.228 --> 36:42.450
to make them dance for you.

36:43.176 --> 36:44.393
Why ?

36:44.556 --> 36:46.870
Why is it always those
who profess to be

36:46.887 --> 36:49.840
the most fervent believers in this war ?

36:50.467 --> 36:52.770
They always manipulate
other people

36:52.785 --> 36:54.913
to die for them.

36:55.907 --> 36:58.723
Does your president
go into battle ?

37:00.187 --> 37:01.920
Or does he send your children ?

37:02.208 --> 37:03.601
Tonight...

37:04.127 --> 37:05.891
all those innocent people.

37:05.908 --> 37:08.651
There is no such thing, Gideon.
They were infidels.

37:08.855 --> 37:10.831
And they were engaged in activities

37:10.836 --> 37:12.422
that spread american policies

37:12.426 --> 37:14.661
over the entire world.

37:15.096 --> 37:17.403
Your incessant need to own things,

37:17.645 --> 37:19.413
material things.

37:20.497 --> 37:23.052
Your capitalism rests on the back

37:23.068 --> 37:24.760
of third world countries.

37:24.775 --> 37:26.781
No one's hands are clean.

37:26.796 --> 37:28.460
No one is innocent.

37:28.465 --> 37:30.572
Those people tonight,
they were innocent.

37:30.585 --> 37:33.230
They never hurt you.

37:33.237 --> 37:36.243
They hurt me by existing.

37:37.577 --> 37:38.263
Yes,

37:38.696 --> 37:40.721
the infidels shall fall

37:40.725 --> 37:42.773
at the hands of the righteous.

37:43.427 --> 37:44.973
And that is when

37:44.986 --> 37:46.232
the Jihad will end.

37:46.246 --> 37:48.722
So you are ready to
murder

37:48.737 --> 37:51.553
4 billion people.

37:53.798 --> 37:55.203
America

37:55.405 --> 37:58.141
has learned nothing from the past.

37:58.156 --> 38:00.352
You harden targets
like your power plants,

38:00.367 --> 38:03.361
but you leave the soft
root for our taking.

38:04.195 --> 38:06.831
What has happened tonight will
affect your economy for years,

38:06.838 --> 38:08.401
the way september 11th

38:08.416 --> 38:10.380
affected air travel.

38:10.526 --> 38:12.910
And maybe the next time

38:13.265 --> 38:15.280
a giant shopping center opens,

38:15.295 --> 38:17.832
people will think
twice before going.

38:17.845 --> 38:20.262
And maybe next it
will be a school. Hey !

38:20.265 --> 38:23.083
You can shut the video
feed down now, Garcia, thanks.

38:25.356 --> 38:26.960
Has the sun not set yet ?

38:26.968 --> 38:27.661
No.

38:34.245 --> 38:35.140
No...

38:35.405 --> 38:38.152
A shopping center. A mall.
It's a grand opening tonight

38:38.158 --> 38:39.550
not long after sunset.

38:39.556 --> 38:42.113
That gives you about an hour.

38:42.495 --> 38:44.213
God help us if they don't make it.

38:44.316 --> 38:47.881
- Let's hope we have somewhere to go.
- Grand opening of the USA mall today.

38:47.898 --> 38:49.840
It's the third largest in the country,
and it's right smack

38:49.858 --> 38:51.891
in the middle of McLean, Virginia.

38:52.145 --> 38:53.821
Let's move.

39:00.718 --> 39:03.691
What's going on with you ? You look like
you've seen a ghost back there.

39:03.706 --> 39:06.583
Haley's supposed to take Jack to the
new mall to have his portrait taken.

39:06.786 --> 39:09.283
- Well, go ahead and call her.
- It's a breach of security.

39:09.288 --> 39:11.681
You'll lose Haley and Jack,
screw this job.

39:11.885 --> 39:14.001
You won't have a life.

39:19.127 --> 39:20.702
I can't reach her.

39:30.425 --> 39:32.543
Morgan, I'm going to find
the security office.

39:32.615 --> 39:34.921
- Morgan !
- Right here.

39:39.936 --> 39:42.202
- Looks like loading dock security.
- Should we evacuate ?

39:42.215 --> 39:44.582
No, no. We'd have mass panic.
Let's go.

39:45.638 --> 39:47.053
Hello ?

39:47.328 --> 39:48.653
- FBI.
- FBI ?

39:48.657 --> 39:51.161
- Are these all your security cameras ?
- Yes, sir.

39:51.287 --> 39:54.001
- What's this camera here ?
- That's the roof. East end.

39:54.016 --> 39:56.410
Morgan, I've got 4 guys
on the east end of the roof.

39:56.418 --> 39:58.431
- What's on that side of t

39:59.305 --> 40:05.198
