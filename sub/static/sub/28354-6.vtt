WEBVTT

00:01.785 --> 00:03.412
I think it's still got some life to it.

00:03.437 --> 00:04.437
Come on, cuzzo.

00:04.462 --> 00:06.975
I didn't know you had mad
mechanic skills like that.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.579
Believe it or not, man,
I learned all of this

00:08.603 --> 00:10.056
from my first high school girlfriend.

00:10.080 --> 00:12.550
- Get the fuck outta here. Word?
- For real, boy.

00:12.575 --> 00:14.721
Big Marge, man. She was 300 pounds, man.

00:14.746 --> 00:17.348
- Could change a flat tire without a jack.
- 300, though?

00:17.373 --> 00:18.389
Mm-hmm.

00:18.413 --> 00:21.182
I don't know if I can handle
all of that, cuzzo. That's a lot.

00:21.207 --> 00:23.360
Can't go wrong with a
girl big and strong, man.

00:23.385 --> 00:25.649
- We used to bang everywhere.
- Really?

00:25.674 --> 00:26.936
You talkin' about, like, in public?

00:26.960 --> 00:29.160
- You know what I'm sayin'?
- No, everywhere on her.

00:29.185 --> 00:30.263
Yeah, man.

00:30.288 --> 00:31.806
All I had to do was lift a fold.

00:31.830 --> 00:33.630
- What?
- You know what's in there?

00:33.655 --> 00:34.925
- What's that?
- Gold.

00:34.950 --> 00:37.215
Well, call me a leprechaun.
I'm about to go dig.

00:38.562 --> 00:40.086
You know what? It's
this right here, man.

00:40.110 --> 00:41.640
This is cool, man.

00:41.665 --> 00:42.825
You know, I really appreciate

00:42.850 --> 00:44.425
you teaching me all this stuff, man,

00:44.450 --> 00:46.650
you know, 'cause I ain't never...

00:47.178 --> 00:48.919
Let me tell you something, Bobby.

00:48.920 --> 00:50.829
Everybody needs
somebody to talk to, man.

00:52.590 --> 00:55.190
Only prison could keep me from you, man.

00:55.297 --> 00:57.281
This is a safe space.

00:58.375 --> 00:59.835
I want you to let it out.

00:59.860 --> 01:01.060
I'm just sayin', you know,

01:01.085 --> 01:03.266
I ain't never opened up to nobody.

01:03.381 --> 01:04.890
You know the codes of the street.

01:04.915 --> 01:06.715
You can't be in touch
with your feelings.

01:06.740 --> 01:08.670
But ever since you got
out, man, it's been...

01:09.940 --> 01:11.539
You know, I been feelin'...

01:11.540 --> 01:13.410
Shay.

01:13.480 --> 01:15.410
Yeah, Shay-Shay, what up?

01:15.480 --> 01:17.940
You need me to come over
and help with the kids?

01:17.950 --> 01:20.410
Wow. You ain't never
asked me that before.

01:20.480 --> 01:22.804
- I'm there.
- So, I was just...

01:22.829 --> 01:24.549
Oh, like, you just gonna
break out like that?

01:24.550 --> 01:26.510
What happened to only
prison was keeping you away?

01:26.560 --> 01:29.065
Sorry, Bobby, my
biological kids need me.

01:29.090 --> 01:30.535
But I'm just sayin'...

01:30.560 --> 01:31.665
You're a grown man, man.

01:31.690 --> 01:33.090
Figure some stuff out on your own.

01:33.195 --> 01:34.475
Look, I don't know what this is!

01:34.500 --> 01:35.900
Well, Google it!

01:39.040 --> 01:41.896
"Abandonment issues."

01:43.666 --> 01:44.770
Oh, that's deep.

01:46.110 --> 01:47.510
- Josh.
- Mm-hmm?

01:47.535 --> 01:48.955
You're a white girl in your 20s.

01:48.980 --> 01:51.559
Which one of these makes you want
to buy our new athletic line?

01:51.584 --> 01:53.156
Uh, all right, white girl I can do,

01:53.180 --> 01:54.740
but it's been a long time since my 20s.

01:54.780 --> 01:56.520
This one?

01:56.545 --> 01:57.735
Cool.

01:57.760 --> 01:59.830
Oh, that must be Tray.

02:00.035 --> 02:02.765
Hey, uh, babe, I know you're
slammed with Fashion Week,

02:02.790 --> 02:05.433
but I really don't think I
need Tray's help with the kids.

02:05.590 --> 02:07.660
Oh, wow. That's a lot of stuff.

02:07.685 --> 02:09.881
- Yeah, I guess I could pretend to need him.
- Mm-hmm.

02:10.600 --> 02:11.999
- Josh!
- What's up?

02:12.000 --> 02:14.470
I'm good, man. Ready and willing.

02:14.540 --> 02:15.999
Okay, you two,

02:16.000 --> 02:18.515
I need you guys to go ahead
and go over this schedule

02:18.540 --> 02:20.070
and figure out who's gonna do what,

02:20.140 --> 02:22.080
where they're gonna do
it, when they gonna do it,

02:22.140 --> 02:24.125
and who's gonna get it done, all right?

02:24.150 --> 02:25.586
- Mm-hmm.
- You guys have a good one.

02:25.610 --> 02:27.136
- Bye.
- Mwah!

02:27.995 --> 02:29.725
Man, this looks like how murderers

02:29.750 --> 02:31.819
- keep track of they victims.
- Yeah. Let's do this.

02:31.820 --> 02:33.690
I will take Amira

02:33.715 --> 02:35.975
to her afternoon tutoring session.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.767
You take Shahzad to Supercuts.

02:39.157 --> 02:41.017
- Sooga, you got jokes.
- Come on.

02:41.295 --> 02:43.375
I mean, I know it's not the
coolest place in the world,

02:43.399 --> 02:44.419
but he likes it.

02:44.444 --> 02:45.483
We get our hair cut together.

02:45.507 --> 02:47.412
- That's cool.
- It is fine for you,

02:47.437 --> 02:49.440
but no self-respecting black man

02:49.465 --> 02:51.459
would get his haircut
from a place like that.

02:51.484 --> 02:53.710
You can't speak for your entire race.

02:53.735 --> 02:55.440
- That's...
- I can and I do...

02:55.465 --> 02:57.026
except for them ones
that's mixed with Asian.

02:57.050 --> 02:59.449
I like them, but, you know,
that's some new shit to me.

02:59.450 --> 03:01.138
I'm gonna run him on
down to the barbershop

03:01.163 --> 03:02.225
I used to go to, Howard's.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.049
I ain't been back there
since I came home anyway.

03:04.050 --> 03:05.494
Really? Why?

03:05.519 --> 03:07.358
You know, my man, Jaybird
at the halfway house?

03:07.382 --> 03:09.136
He be hookin' me up.
You know what I'm sayin'?

03:09.160 --> 03:11.730
Till the cops came and
confiscated all his razors

03:11.790 --> 03:13.690
for evidence in a cold case.

03:14.714 --> 03:18.714
- Synced and corrected by<font color="#00BFFF"> Firefly </font>-
- <font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com</font> -

03:19.670 --> 03:21.470
Man, back in the days,

03:21.540 --> 03:23.870
Howard's was the heart
and soul of Brooklyn.

03:23.895 --> 03:25.540
That's where you went to find out

03:25.565 --> 03:27.119
what was the word on the streets.

03:27.144 --> 03:28.585
I ain't been here in so long.

03:28.610 --> 03:30.740
Wow! I remember when you was a kid.

03:30.810 --> 03:33.410
Aw, man. Chico!

03:33.435 --> 03:35.375
- What up, baby?
- What up, baby?

03:38.420 --> 03:40.441
Is that Tray Biz-ag?

03:40.466 --> 03:42.635
- Howie How! What up, baby?
- Aw, man.

03:42.660 --> 03:44.530
Yo! Give me some.

03:44.675 --> 03:48.005
And this has got to be
either your clone or your son.

03:48.030 --> 03:49.805
This is my seed right here, Shahzad.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.499
- What's up, little man?
- Hey, what's up, man?

03:51.500 --> 03:52.630
Hey, let me tell you,

03:52.655 --> 03:54.675
your dad was the only dude tough enough

03:54.700 --> 03:56.685
that, when I cut his hair, it cut back.

03:58.510 --> 04:00.909
I just want to give my son
a real barbershop experience.

04:00.910 --> 04:02.393
Hey, listen, no problem.

04:02.418 --> 04:04.509
But we not just a
barbershop anymore, Tray.

04:04.510 --> 04:06.302
Now we're a gentleman's salon.

04:06.327 --> 04:07.559
- Gentleman's salon?
- Yeah.

04:07.584 --> 04:10.026
Like, this is where I watch
strippers get their hair washed?

04:10.050 --> 04:12.450
Things changed while
you were locked up, man.

04:12.475 --> 04:13.850
But this is an institution,

04:13.920 --> 04:15.519
and if it ain't broke, why fix it?

04:15.520 --> 04:17.326
I got to keep up with the competition.

04:17.351 --> 04:18.836
Look, I even brought
in some new barbers.

04:18.860 --> 04:21.315
Naw, Howard, I ain't
trusting my son's hairline

04:21.339 --> 04:22.706
with no dude from the Pringles can.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.670
Nah, I got you, man.

04:24.730 --> 04:26.530
Your hairline will be so sharp,

04:26.540 --> 04:28.470
you ain't gonna be able to get past TSA.

04:28.540 --> 04:30.484
Give me two seconds to finish
up this customer, all right?

04:30.508 --> 04:31.520
All right.

04:31.545 --> 04:32.945
See, this used to be my spot.

04:33.010 --> 04:35.080
Now it's your spot, too.

04:35.140 --> 04:37.221
- Yo, Tray.
- Felony.

04:37.246 --> 04:39.680
What's up, man? What's going on?

04:39.705 --> 04:40.834
- What up, Shahzad?
- What's up?

04:40.858 --> 04:42.880
Oh, man, you look a mess.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.726
I guess we both gotta
start paying for haircuts

04:44.750 --> 04:46.736
now that Jaybird's officially
a "person of interest."

04:46.760 --> 04:48.620
Why he like razor blades so much?

04:48.735 --> 04:50.136
- The heart wants what it wants.
- Mm.

04:50.160 --> 04:52.201
Anyways, it's the weekend.

04:52.226 --> 04:53.430
It's time to get it right.

04:53.500 --> 04:55.580
Even made an appointment
with these Vietnamese ladies

04:55.605 --> 04:56.605
to get my feet hooked up.

04:56.630 --> 05:00.298
_

05:00.323 --> 05:01.969
Hell no!

05:01.970 --> 05:04.025
It's a little game we play.

05:04.050 --> 05:05.119
Anyway, in the meantime,

05:05.144 --> 05:06.486
maybe one of y'all can hook me up.

05:06.510 --> 05:08.468
- I'm booked till February.
- Shit, I'll cut you

05:08.493 --> 05:10.510
before I cut you. Beat it!

05:10.580 --> 05:13.105
Oh, my bad.

05:15.474 --> 05:16.544
It's even now.

05:19.679 --> 05:21.103
Thanks.

05:21.128 --> 05:22.889
Uh, can I have everyone's attention?

05:22.914 --> 05:25.895
I'd like to thank you all
so much for working so hard.

05:25.920 --> 05:26.990
And the good news is,

05:27.000 --> 05:29.006
Copeland's might let us go ahead

05:29.031 --> 05:31.070
and do something more couture next year.

05:31.095 --> 05:32.290
Who's with me?

05:33.670 --> 05:35.352
All right. Let's do this.

05:41.810 --> 05:43.609
Growing up in the projects,

05:43.610 --> 05:45.209
there's one of two options, man...

05:45.210 --> 05:46.950
The post office or prison,

05:47.020 --> 05:49.819
and I do not look good
in them mailman shorts.

05:49.820 --> 05:52.506
But I'm gonna flip it on the
prison system with my food truck.

05:52.531 --> 05:55.078
That's right. I'll make
your taste buds my bitch.

05:56.160 --> 05:58.760
Yo, my sweets gonna make
your teeth do a cavity search,

05:58.874 --> 06:00.994
and not with no prison guard
with a little flashlight.

06:02.770 --> 06:04.310
Let me tell you somethin'.

06:04.335 --> 06:06.764
When I pull my food truck up
in front of this barbershop,

06:06.789 --> 06:07.851
y'all better not be cheap.

06:07.876 --> 06:08.883
Dig down deep.

06:08.908 --> 06:10.745
If you can pay $7 for a latte,

06:10.770 --> 06:12.510
you can spend $3 on the coffee

06:12.535 --> 06:15.125
that been filtered through
some drawers and an old doo-rag.

06:17.380 --> 06:20.649
This is the barbershop.

06:20.650 --> 06:22.380
All family.

06:22.450 --> 06:26.520
I'm so happy to be home.

06:26.590 --> 06:28.859
The longest day ever.

06:28.860 --> 06:29.920
Just want to lay down.

06:31.860 --> 06:33.986
How was the schedule
and everything with Tray?

06:34.011 --> 06:35.372
- How'd that work out?
- I don't know.

06:35.396 --> 06:37.330
It's okay, I guess.

06:37.400 --> 06:38.600
What's wrong with you?

06:38.807 --> 06:41.077
Uh, 11 unanswered calls?

06:41.102 --> 06:43.270
I was gonna call again,
but 12 unanswered calls

06:43.295 --> 06:45.540
seemed like a... a
bridge too far for me.

06:45.565 --> 06:47.470
I'm sorry, but it was a long day.

06:47.480 --> 06:50.010
- It was crazy at work, okay?
- Crazy?

06:50.035 --> 06:51.635
But I'm home now.

06:51.750 --> 06:53.550
- Mm-hmm.
- What was the emergency?

06:56.724 --> 06:58.054
Ew.

06:58.079 --> 06:59.209
A dick pic?

06:59.234 --> 07:00.729
That don't even look like yours.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.805
- Why you got that on your phone?
- It's not mine.

07:02.830 --> 07:04.360
This is not my phone.

07:04.475 --> 07:05.735
It's Amira's phone.

07:05.760 --> 07:06.760
What?!

07:07.012 --> 07:08.107
Okay.

07:08.401 --> 07:10.699
- Yeah.
- Okay. Okay.

07:10.700 --> 07:12.030
Okay. Oh, God.

07:12.328 --> 07:14.058
Okay, okay.

07:15.440 --> 07:17.700
Are you... Is this all you're gonna say?

07:17.710 --> 07:19.709
- What did you say to her?
- Nothing.

07:19.710 --> 07:21.020
I sent her to her room,

07:21.045 --> 07:22.709
and I told her you'd talk to her.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.110
- Why?
- Why?

07:24.135 --> 07:26.865
'Cause isn't this a classic
mother-daughter conversation?

07:26.890 --> 07:27.950
I can't.

07:27.975 --> 07:29.450
She's still my little baby girl.

07:29.475 --> 07:30.675
Oh, good. Y'all here.

07:30.790 --> 07:33.416
So, I've been thinking.

07:34.660 --> 07:36.590
Instead of going to college,

07:36.615 --> 07:38.345
I decided I want to be a barber.

07:43.870 --> 07:45.470
Dibs on that one.

07:45.530 --> 07:47.700
What did you and Tray
do to my kids today?

07:52.968 --> 07:54.768
Hey, kiddo. What you doing?

07:54.793 --> 07:56.289
Oh, I'm just playing this game,

07:56.314 --> 07:57.329
- but, like, if you...
- That's cool.

07:57.353 --> 07:59.049
Hey, uh, you know that whole, uh,

07:59.050 --> 08:00.552
not-going-to-college thing,

08:00.577 --> 08:02.209
- did you really mean that?
- Yeah.

08:02.234 --> 08:04.849
Tray took me to this dope
barbershop today, right?

08:04.874 --> 08:06.397
- Mm-hmm.
- So, like, just to hang out

08:06.422 --> 08:07.614
at a place like that,

08:07.705 --> 08:10.835
as your job, like, would be the best.

08:10.860 --> 08:13.415
Yeah, I just...

08:14.400 --> 08:16.978
Just feel like, you know, being a barber

08:17.003 --> 08:18.930
would kind of be a
waste of your talents.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.954
But you and Mom always said

08:20.979 --> 08:22.700
you support anything we want to be.

08:24.270 --> 08:25.740
We lied, son.

08:25.810 --> 08:26.870
We lied to you.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.340
Oh, wow.

08:28.731 --> 08:30.800
- That's messed up.
- Mm-hmm, I know.

08:30.825 --> 08:31.952
Good talk.

08:37.020 --> 08:39.220
- Hey, girl.
- You're still here?

08:39.289 --> 08:41.135
I thought you had to work
all weekend for Fashion Week.

08:41.159 --> 08:43.265
Uh, yeah, I decided to
take the day off work.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.558
I thought that maybe we
should hang out together.

08:45.583 --> 08:47.830
You know, maybe get our hair did,

08:47.855 --> 08:49.782
just hang out as girls, girl.

08:49.807 --> 08:51.108
- Us?
- Mm-hmm.

08:51.133 --> 08:52.392
- Together?
- Mm-hmm.

08:52.417 --> 08:53.760
- Me with you?
- Yeah.

08:53.785 --> 08:56.285
We could catch up on some girl chitchat.

08:56.310 --> 08:58.710
You know, hang out as girls, girl.

08:58.735 --> 09:00.687
Why do you keep saying "girl"?

09:00.712 --> 09:02.840
I-I don't know. Just
put your coat on, girl.

09:02.865 --> 09:04.735
Come on.

09:04.850 --> 09:07.450
We're just gonna make
one quick little stop.

09:07.520 --> 09:10.180
I made you an appointment
at Dr. Sumen's.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.343
Why am I going to see your OB/GYN?

09:12.368 --> 09:13.390
No reason.

09:13.460 --> 09:15.661
I just... think that it's time

09:15.686 --> 09:18.060
that we get you started on, um...

09:18.175 --> 09:19.175
birth control.

09:19.200 --> 09:20.200
Birth control?

09:20.505 --> 09:21.645
Why?

09:21.670 --> 09:23.280
You got boys sending you pictures

09:23.305 --> 09:24.622
- of their ding-a-ling in your phone!
- Oh, my...

09:24.646 --> 09:25.705
And so...

09:25.730 --> 09:27.130
... I figured that's what you gonna need.

09:27.140 --> 09:29.270
A boy didn't send that.
Jessica Peters did.

09:29.340 --> 09:31.046
Why would a girl send
you pictures like that?

09:31.070 --> 09:34.270
Because it's for the "Dick Report."

09:34.340 --> 09:36.140
The... What in the hell is that?!

09:36.210 --> 09:37.740
From now on, can we both agree on

09:37.750 --> 09:39.075
using the word "ding-a-ling"?

09:39.100 --> 09:40.370
It was just a joke, okay?

09:40.395 --> 09:42.749
Jessica Peters collects
the pictures from the boys,

09:42.750 --> 09:44.796
and then, the girls compare
them in the "Dick Report."

09:44.820 --> 09:47.386
Well, Amira, I don't want
you lookin' at nasty pictures

09:47.411 --> 09:48.688
of boys' ding-a-lings.

09:48.713 --> 09:51.192
And this Jessica Peters
sounds like a real slut,

09:51.217 --> 09:53.830
- if you ask me.
- She is!

09:53.855 --> 09:56.115
Mom, I'm still a virgin, okay?

09:56.140 --> 09:59.275
I'm not... Ugh! Having sex.

09:59.300 --> 10:00.900
Whew! Thank you.

10:00.970 --> 10:02.969
Thank you. My baby is pure.

10:04.865 --> 10:06.995
- Oh, quick question.
- Uh-huh?

10:07.110 --> 10:08.979
So, is giving oral still considered sex?

10:08.980 --> 10:10.179
Is what?!

10:16.545 --> 10:19.005
It was a question.

10:19.030 --> 10:21.099
I don't actually do it.

10:21.190 --> 10:23.165
Well, next time, maybe
you should lead with that.

10:24.285 --> 10:26.020
Yeah, look at it, observe it.

10:26.045 --> 10:27.672
- Right, man.
- Don't cut it till you're sure.

10:27.696 --> 10:28.761
Don't clip it till you sure.

10:28.785 --> 10:29.906
I promise you,
Aaron, you about to pick up

10:29.930 --> 10:31.199
mad Puerto Rican chicks.

10:31.200 --> 10:32.870
Hey, what's all this?

10:32.940 --> 10:34.399
Kid got real talent.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.715
Aaron's letting me practice
my barber skills on him.

10:36.740 --> 10:38.140
Uh-huh, yeah, but, uh...

10:38.210 --> 10:39.684
hey, I thought we settled this.

10:39.709 --> 10:42.051
I was gonna let the barber
thing go like you told me to,

10:42.076 --> 10:44.241
but Tray and Bobby bought
me these nice clippers,

10:44.266 --> 10:47.410
and I gots to say, I
really like cutting.

10:47.420 --> 10:49.280
Well, I didn't really buy the clippers.

10:49.350 --> 10:52.020
I got it from my man that, you
know, cut at the funeral home.

10:52.090 --> 10:53.890
Tray, I kind of assumed
that we were gonna be

10:53.915 --> 10:55.975
on the same page about
this barber thing.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.730
What's wrong with being a barber?

10:57.890 --> 11:00.520
Growing up, that was one of
the most prestigious positions

11:00.545 --> 11:01.735
in the neighborhood.

11:01.760 --> 11:03.760
You had the teacher, the preacher,

11:03.830 --> 11:06.430
and then the barber, and
then, on top of all that,

11:06.500 --> 11:08.770
you had the dude that
could dunk over a car.

11:08.840 --> 11:11.240
I get it. I get all of it. But come on.

11:11.355 --> 11:13.485
I mean, we're talking
about my son here, so...

11:13.510 --> 11:15.755
- This is how the boy used to look.
- Mm.

11:15.780 --> 11:17.440
Yeah, Shahzad gave him a haircut.

11:17.465 --> 11:19.355
It's not a religious calling, Tray.

11:19.380 --> 11:23.180
Josh, please don't tell
me that you are jelly

11:23.295 --> 11:25.965
'cause I introduced him to
something I was interested in.

11:25.990 --> 11:27.269
That's ridiculous.

11:27.294 --> 11:28.395
- That is ridiculous.
- 'Cause that would be petty.

11:28.419 --> 11:30.059
I don't... I would... I'm not...

11:30.060 --> 11:31.459
That's... That's ridiculous.

11:31.460 --> 11:33.176
Listen, I know how to
settle this, all right?

11:33.200 --> 11:35.200
We're gonna let the experts decide.

11:35.260 --> 11:36.330
What does that mean?

11:36.400 --> 11:38.330
Everybody, let's go. Let's go.

11:38.445 --> 11:40.375
Transform and roll out. Let's roll.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.070
Dick pics?

11:42.140 --> 11:43.740
Somebody's sending you dick pics?

11:43.765 --> 11:45.165
It's nothing. It's nothing.

11:45.190 --> 11:46.855
No, I want to hear Ms. Ashley's opinion.

11:46.880 --> 11:47.883
Go ahead, Val.

11:47.908 --> 11:50.479
I mean, you seem a little
young for that, that's all.

11:50.480 --> 11:52.385
Kids nowadays aren't like we used to be.

11:52.410 --> 11:53.750
We need to be grateful

11:53.775 --> 11:55.325
they don't have our sexual hang-ups.

11:55.350 --> 11:56.820
Can we please change the subject?

11:56.845 --> 11:58.175
- Who sent who a dick pic?
- Oh.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.889
Oh, some boy sent a
picture of his junk to her.

12:00.890 --> 12:03.960
No, it was a girl. Jessica Peters.

12:03.985 --> 12:05.935
Jessica Peters. She sounds white.

12:05.960 --> 12:06.981
Mm-hmm.

12:07.006 --> 12:08.899
- Okay, that's racist.
- Maybe.

12:08.900 --> 12:10.299
But you still go to that fancy school?

12:10.300 --> 12:11.855
It's not that fancy.

12:11.880 --> 12:14.243
The girls there think that
blowjobs ain't even sex.

12:14.268 --> 12:16.314
- What the hell?
- What?! That's crazy!

12:16.339 --> 12:17.900
Amira, you not doing that, are you?

12:17.970 --> 12:19.710
No. Oh, my goodness.

12:19.735 --> 12:22.135
Never do that. It's against God.

12:22.240 --> 12:24.673
And the only reason they
even invented oral sex

12:24.698 --> 12:26.356
was so white people
could keep black folks

12:26.381 --> 12:28.085
from procreating and
taking over the world.

12:28.110 --> 12:30.380
Now, when you're older, it's different.

12:30.450 --> 12:33.650
I don't let my husband leave
for work without hooking him up.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.990
I want him going out the door on E.

12:36.060 --> 12:37.366
That's how I know he comin' back.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.089
Oh, girl get outta here.

12:39.114 --> 12:40.329
Ain't nobody got time for all that.

12:40.330 --> 12:41.970
My man be lucky if he
get a cup of coffee.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.724
Now, listen, don't listen to them.

12:43.749 --> 12:45.825
When you are older, you
will decide for yourself

12:45.850 --> 12:47.715
what you want and what you don't want.

12:47.740 --> 12:50.234
And don't let anybody
pressure you into nothin'.

12:50.259 --> 12:51.929
Just pretend I'm not here.

12:51.954 --> 12:54.010
Hey, listen, that white
girl from your school,

12:54.080 --> 12:55.410
now, she can be a ho

12:55.435 --> 12:56.985
and still grow up to be president.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.880
- Mm-hmm.
- But not us.

12:58.995 --> 13:00.455
If you are even rumored

13:00.480 --> 13:02.520
to have fooled around with
a boy in the boiler room,

13:02.550 --> 13:03.874
folks will talk about it

13:03.899 --> 13:06.065
like you ain't ever done
shit else in your life.

13:06.090 --> 13:08.080
People will bring it up years later.

13:08.105 --> 13:09.759
And on Facebook, instead of saying,

13:09.760 --> 13:12.359
"Hey, Val, heard you opened
up a beautiful salon,"

13:12.360 --> 13:14.544
they write, "Hey,
'Kneepads', how you been?"

13:14.569 --> 13:15.859
All right, I think that's enough.

13:15.883 --> 13:18.300
I think that's enough. Yeah.

13:18.370 --> 13:21.003
I just came here to
show you what my son did.

13:21.028 --> 13:22.970
Behold.

13:23.212 --> 13:24.542
Ah.

13:24.567 --> 13:26.267
Oh.

13:29.710 --> 13:30.980
Okay.

13:32.331 --> 13:34.831
- Not bad.
- You really hooked him up.

13:37.390 --> 13:39.401
All right. I see, son.

13:39.426 --> 13:41.346
I see you got a little skills, man.

13:41.371 --> 13:42.553
Nah, y'all don't get it, man.

13:42.577 --> 13:44.189
This was his first cut.

13:44.190 --> 13:45.730
- Word?
- First cut?

13:45.790 --> 13:47.236
- I don't know about...
- That's impressive, man.

13:47.260 --> 13:49.399
- That's... No. Yeah.
- No, I don't...

13:49.400 --> 13:50.834
- He can't even see over the chair.
- He too small.

13:50.858 --> 13:53.074
- Come on, man.
- Feet low! He's dainty.

13:53.099 --> 13:54.229
Who taught you?

13:54.254 --> 13:55.445
Nobody.

13:55.470 --> 13:57.800
My son is a Jedi master
with them clippers.

14:00.210 --> 14:02.210
You can leave, Aaron.
Thanks for coming down, baby.

14:04.410 --> 14:05.809
I don't know where I am.

14:05.810 --> 14:07.950
Google Maps, Aaron!

14:08.020 --> 14:10.750
His first cut. What you think?

14:10.820 --> 14:12.290
I don't know, man.

14:12.350 --> 14:13.890
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

14:13.960 --> 14:15.960
Y'all think he could be that good?

14:16.020 --> 14:17.420
I mean, that was the last time

14:17.430 --> 14:19.391
I heard of someone starting that young.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.170
What? What is it?

14:27.700 --> 14:29.000
The Legend of Siz.

14:30.334 --> 14:31.603
What's that?

14:31.628 --> 14:33.538
Siz was the greatest barber

14:33.563 --> 14:34.839
in the borough of Brooklyn.

14:34.885 --> 14:36.285
He was my mentor.

14:39.780 --> 14:41.849
It all started back in 1986.

14:43.000 --> 14:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:52.130 --> 14:54.459
One day, this guy comes
running into the shop.

14:54.460 --> 14:56.800
He's clearly distressed, right?

14:56.825 --> 14:59.155
Siz, you gotta help me.
I got a show tonight.

14:59.180 --> 15:01.887
My boy was linin' me up,
his hand slipped, and...

15:07.010 --> 15:08.740
Man, I can't go on stage like this.

15:22.290 --> 15:24.089
Thanks, Siz. You the man.

15:26.855 --> 15:29.715
You're welcome, Big Daddy Kane.

15:29.740 --> 15:31.370
After his show that night,

15:31.430 --> 15:34.300
Big Daddy Kane's album
shot straight up the charts.

15:34.370 --> 15:35.840
The rest is history.

15:35.900 --> 15:37.970
- Who's Big Daddy Kane?
- Shh.

15:38.040 --> 15:40.980
Man, that's nothin' compared
to what I saw Siz do.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.110
When I was in junior high,

15:43.180 --> 15:45.450
I'll never forget it.

16:14.077 --> 16:16.525
Okay, I'm starting to
doubt some of these details.

16:16.550 --> 16:18.280
But continue.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.702
Yeah. I knew him, too.

16:21.727 --> 16:23.949
We did time together. He was an OG.

16:23.950 --> 16:27.820
In fact, I'm the one
he gave his last cut to.

16:43.970 --> 16:46.295
- He did great things.
- Yeah.

16:46.320 --> 16:48.311
Things that no one has done since.

16:48.336 --> 16:50.240
- Word.
- Maybe that's because he's...

16:50.265 --> 16:51.755
And you, too, have that gift.

16:51.780 --> 16:53.850
- Mm-hmm.
- This is ridiculous.

16:53.875 --> 16:56.605
My son is gonna be
more than just a barber.

16:56.720 --> 16:58.686
What...

17:00.054 --> 17:01.503
So, what you sayin', white boy?

17:02.757 --> 17:05.339
Ay, you disrespectin'
Siz's legacy, yo.

17:05.365 --> 17:06.825
Well, I wouldn't say that.

17:07.260 --> 17:09.530
Siz's dream wasn't to be a barber.

17:09.599 --> 17:11.128
It wasn't?

17:11.130 --> 17:12.900
Nah.

17:14.200 --> 17:18.010
He told me one night he
dreamed of being a surgeon,

17:18.069 --> 17:21.010
but he didn't have any surgery
role models in the hood.

17:21.301 --> 17:23.502
So he used his gifted
hands for something

17:23.527 --> 17:27.280
he had access to... cutting hair.

17:27.349 --> 17:29.149
No disrespect,

17:29.150 --> 17:31.420
but it wasn't my dream
to be a barber, son.

17:31.490 --> 17:33.620
I wanted to be a music producer, yo.

17:33.690 --> 17:35.560
I got beats.

17:35.585 --> 17:37.336
Truth be told, I always
wanted to go to college.

17:37.360 --> 17:41.100
Always wanted to go to an
all-black college and play lacrosse.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.630
Truth be told.

17:42.700 --> 17:45.700
Yeah, man, the barber's
life ain't the end goal,

17:45.725 --> 17:47.345
unless you gonna own your own shop.

17:47.370 --> 17:50.017
- I netted $200K last year.
- Really?

17:50.042 --> 17:51.685
Oh, now you gonna be on board, Josh?

17:51.710 --> 17:53.570
Oh, come on! Money's still important.

17:53.580 --> 17:55.651
I want him to be able
to take care of himself.

17:55.676 --> 17:57.475
- See, that is the difference between me and you.
- What?

17:57.499 --> 17:58.699
You want him to make a lot of money.

17:58.723 --> 17:59.944
I want him to live his dreams.

17:59.969 --> 18:01.357
No, that's not what I meant.

18:01.382 --> 18:04.380
Shouldn't this be my
decision and mine only?

18:04.390 --> 18:06.250
Yeah. Yeah, it should.

18:06.320 --> 18:08.189
True. So, what do you want to do?

18:08.190 --> 18:09.389
Seriously?

18:09.390 --> 18:10.390
Y'all got time for all of this,

18:10.391 --> 18:11.990
but I can't get a chair?

18:12.060 --> 18:13.460
I know how to settle this.

18:19.340 --> 18:21.619
Yo, make sure you get
my taper, little man.

18:21.644 --> 18:22.984
It's gotta be tight.

18:23.009 --> 18:25.140
- What's happening?
- Shh!

18:25.210 --> 18:26.586
This is the time for the blend.

18:26.610 --> 18:28.340
It's the hardest part.

18:29.210 --> 18:32.080
Come on. You got it, Little Tray.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.220
The gift is strong on this one.

18:37.056 --> 18:39.150
Tell him to remove the guards.

18:39.175 --> 18:41.245
What?! I can't tell him that, Siz!

18:41.360 --> 18:42.904
He won't have any control!

18:42.929 --> 18:44.467
He'll just have to go on...

18:44.492 --> 18:45.690
Feel.

18:45.760 --> 18:47.290
Feel.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.430
Tell him, Tray.

18:50.700 --> 18:52.370
Shahzad...

18:52.430 --> 18:54.230
remove the guard.

18:55.347 --> 18:58.105
What?! What are you talking about?!

18:58.130 --> 18:59.355
Let go.

18:59.380 --> 19:00.510
He's not ready!

19:02.240 --> 19:04.180
I am so scared.

19:04.250 --> 19:05.649
Everything'll be fine.

19:29.386 --> 19:30.645
Remove the guards!

19:31.256 --> 19:33.126
Remove the guards!

19:33.151 --> 19:35.080
This is free, right?

19:35.105 --> 19:36.230

19:36.255 --> 19:38.436
_

19:38.682 --> 19:42.435
_

19:42.459 --> 19:44.729
_

19:44.753 --> 19:48.975
_

19:49.412 --> 19:51.689
I actually found a
few four-year colleges

19:51.714 --> 19:53.535
that have barber education programs

19:53.560 --> 19:55.300
so that he could take
business classes, too.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.630
Man, you ain't got to go
to college to get no degree.

19:57.655 --> 20:00.525
This scar is my bachelor
from the streets.

20:00.640 --> 20:02.300
- You want to see my doctorate?
- No.

20:02.325 --> 20:03.572
What is all this?

20:03.597 --> 20:05.970
Hey, nothin'. Just some
successful co-parenting.

20:06.040 --> 20:07.943
Yeah, it's kind
of our thing, you know?

20:07.968 --> 20:09.310
Oh, you guys have a thing now?

20:09.335 --> 20:10.507
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, we got a thing.

20:10.531 --> 20:12.816
- Dudes can have a dude thing.
- Oh.

20:14.483 --> 20:17.119
Hey. There's the barber genius himself.

20:17.120 --> 20:18.650
People gonna be like, "Siz who?"

20:18.720 --> 20:20.719
I decided I don't want
to be barber no more.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.353
What? What are you talking about?

20:23.378 --> 20:24.660
You have a gift.

20:24.730 --> 20:27.460
Well, there's this
really hot girl at school,

20:27.530 --> 20:28.800
and she's into me.

20:28.860 --> 20:32.600
Her name's Jessica Peters,
and she loves music.

20:32.670 --> 20:36.000
So I think I'm gonna just be a musician.

20:39.610 --> 20:40.740
Yeah.

20:42.880 --> 20:44.332
Jessica Peters, huh?

20:44.357 --> 20:45.426
I heard him.

20:45.451 --> 20:46.725
Hey, hey.

20:46.750 --> 20:48.149
Hey, Shay, where you going?

20:48.150 --> 20:49.815
To break Amira's phone.

20:49.840 --> 20:51.420
She'll thank me later.

20:51.490 --> 20:53.950
Man, he pulled out a flute.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.920
You can't make no
money with a flute, man.
