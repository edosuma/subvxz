            Previously:

00:02.240 --> 00:05.000
            Previously:
Dr and Mrs Wayne Fiscus!

00:05.000 --> 00:06.640
Dr and Mrs Wayne Fiscus!

00:06.640 --> 00:09.000
The death squads
torture in El Salvador.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.720
Under no circumstances can he spend
the night at Stevie Sherwin's house.

00:12.720 --> 00:14.840
Surgery? In this dump?

00:14.840 --> 00:16.400
The guy doesn't have a prayer!

00:16.400 --> 00:20.160
You can't go around making love
every time you feel like it.

00:20.160 --> 00:22.560
She and a retarded boy made love.

00:22.560 --> 00:25.520
Now, you've got some nerve
telling me I can't step in now.

00:25.520 --> 00:29.520
This is my child who's pregnant,
and your hospital's responsible!

02:08.080 --> 02:10.199
Stuck, Elliot?

02:10.199 --> 02:14.200
Yesterday this was such a great
parking space!

02:14.320 --> 02:16.200
Don't be late for rounds.

02:16.200 --> 02:18.200
Actually, I'm off today, sir.

02:18.200 --> 02:22.200
&lt; ..slopping off work,
waiting for your next coffee break.

02:22.760 --> 02:26.320
For crying out loud, you've
got a bucketful of rock salt

02:26.320 --> 02:28.000
and five icy steps!

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
Dig in, grab a handful and throw
it around, like that. You try it.

02:32.280 --> 02:35.440
Dig in,
grab a handful and throw it around.

02:35.440 --> 02:39.440
Otherwise someone like Dr Auschlander
here slips, falls on his keester,

02:39.720 --> 02:42.040
     and bang, one Teflon hip.

02:42.040 --> 02:46.040
At his age, bones snap like twigs.

02:48.560 --> 02:52.560
Have a nice day(!)

02:54.120 --> 02:57.240
Mark, I haven't heard you
utter a civil word in two weeks.

02:57.240 --> 02:58.880
You gotta learn to be positive.

02:58.880 --> 03:01.560
I'm dog-tired.
The baby needs to be fed

03:01.560 --> 03:04.840
during the late show, the early show,
the milkman's matinee...

03:04.840 --> 03:07.760
Ellen keeps having nightmares
about Stephen's death,

03:07.760 --> 03:11.520
and my accountant informed me
that I have to prepay Â¤4,000

03:11.520 --> 03:13.400
in taxes before the end of the month.

03:13.400 --> 03:16.840
But if it'll make you happy, Daniel,
I will try to be more positive.

03:16.840 --> 03:19.080
Good morning! And goodbye.

03:19.080 --> 03:20.160
                 Where are you going?

03:20.160 --> 03:23.360
Starting my community service work.
Boston Women's Clinic.

03:23.360 --> 03:24.440
Are the pro-lifers still picketing?

03:24.440 --> 03:25.800
Are the pro-lifers still picketing?
Yeah.

03:25.800 --> 03:28.880
Will you push that mop out in front
of you? Go ahead, push it.

03:28.880 --> 03:32.360
And then, before you pull it back,
flip it over so that you're always

03:32.360 --> 03:35.120
mopping with a clean surface.
And use some muscle!

03:35.120 --> 03:39.120
                                 Hey!

03:40.280 --> 03:41.800
           Good morning!

03:41.800 --> 03:45.800
Oh, did you believe the cold
last night?! And that wind!

03:46.160 --> 03:49.600
I felt sure that Rich's flight
to Buffalo would've been cancelled

03:49.600 --> 03:53.000
this morning, 'cause they
always have it worse up there.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
Mom, do you mind waiting
till I finish my coffee?

03:57.200 --> 03:58.360
           What is that?

03:58.360 --> 03:59.720
A menthol!

03:59.720 --> 04:02.960
Give that to me!
And gimme the pack, too.

04:02.960 --> 04:06.960
How dare you! Don't let me
ever catch you smoking again.

04:07.800 --> 04:10.440
Finish your breakfast.
You'll be late for school.

04:10.440 --> 04:14.400
Erin, if you want a ride,
you better move it!

04:14.400 --> 04:17.040
Tell her yet, runt?
About the money?

04:17.040 --> 04:18.680
Get outta my face.

04:18.680 --> 04:22.040
Mom should've thrown this
thing away a month ago,

04:22.040 --> 04:23.880
when Stevie Sherman gave it to you.

04:23.880 --> 04:26.000
And don't bother going
in my desk again,

04:26.000 --> 04:27.680
    Mack the Knife will not be there.

04:27.680 --> 04:30.800
Your desk isn't the only
thing he went into last night.

04:30.800 --> 04:32.440
He took ten bucks
                 from the money jar!

04:32.440 --> 04:34.000
He took ten bucks
                 from the money jar!
Jimmy, you are a wuss!

04:34.000 --> 04:35.640
   Stop that right now. Stop it,

04:35.640 --> 04:37.320
     both of you. Let him go.

04:37.320 --> 04:41.320
Go wait in the car, please. I'll
take you to school on my way to work.

04:41.560 --> 04:45.080
You and I are going to have to have
quite a chat.

04:45.080 --> 04:48.600
            Off you go.

04:48.600 --> 04:50.920
 Oh, Lord. Where are my car keys?

04:50.920 --> 04:53.040
Jeff's really
getting out of hand, Mom.

04:53.040 --> 04:57.040
Oh, I know, dear,
but he's going through changes,
starting adolescence.

04:58.200 --> 05:01.000
We're really gonna have to
try to be understanding.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.240
He needs somebody
to rip his face off.

05:03.240 --> 05:05.440
      I don't like that kind of talk.

05:05.440 --> 05:09.440
LOUD CRASH

05:14.880 --> 05:18.880
Transmission's out of whack.

05:19.120 --> 05:23.120
CHANT:
Murder is not a mother's right!
Murder is not a mother's right!

05:24.040 --> 05:26.600
Murder is not a mother's right!

05:26.600 --> 05:30.280
Murder is not a mother's right!
Murder is not a mother's right!

05:30.280 --> 05:32.080
Murder is not a mother's right!

05:32.080 --> 05:36.080
Murder is not a mother's right!
 Murder is not a mother's right!

05:37.080 --> 05:37.840
Yes?

05:37.840 --> 05:39.000
Yes?
Hi. I'm Dr Chandler.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.280
Mm-hmm?

05:40.280 --> 05:41.920
Phil Chandler.

05:41.920 --> 05:45.920
Oh, hi. Come on in. Right over there.

05:48.080 --> 05:52.080
DOOR BUZZES

05:55.120 --> 05:56.680
                    Francine Kennedy.

05:56.680 --> 05:57.720
                    Francine Kennedy.
Hi.

05:57.720 --> 05:59.440
                            Watch it.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.880
Welcome to the Boston Women's Clinic.

06:01.880 --> 06:03.920
What's left of it.

06:03.920 --> 06:07.120
Pro-lifers started picketing here
yesterday morning,

06:07.120 --> 06:08.920
and last night someone broke in.

06:08.920 --> 06:11.560
I thought the snowstorm'd
    keep the marchers away.

06:11.560 --> 06:13.360
They're nothing if not dedicated.

06:13.360 --> 06:16.120
Can you give me a hand here?
And watch out for glass.

06:16.120 --> 06:19.080
You might wanna keep your coat on
till the meter comes up.

06:19.080 --> 06:22.800
The clinic is not top priority
with the city's fuel allocation.

06:22.800 --> 06:26.800
So we pace ourselves
and the women freeze their
tails off in the exam rooms.

06:28.040 --> 06:32.040
But you're warm as toast in there,
aren't you?

06:32.760 --> 06:34.760
Did you have any trouble
getting through the protestors?

06:34.760 --> 06:36.840
Did you have any trouble
getting through the protestors?
Uh, no.

06:36.840 --> 06:39.040
Caught a snowball
     on the side of the head.

06:39.040 --> 06:41.360
The Revolutionary War
started that way.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.920
Citizens helping
British soldiers, right?

06:43.920 --> 06:47.520
 Y'know, the Boston Customs House?

06:47.520 --> 06:50.040
Well, it teed me off pretty good.

06:50.040 --> 06:52.400
           I have been followed home,

06:52.400 --> 06:56.400
had my car tyres slashed,
received threatening phone calls...

06:58.040 --> 07:02.040
Please, my wife needs help.

07:05.360 --> 07:06.800
What's the problem?

07:06.800 --> 07:09.880
MURDERER! You're covered
   with the blood of children!

07:09.880 --> 07:11.520
Stop the killing!

07:11.520 --> 07:15.520
You're slaughtering millions of
babies! Murderer! Stop the killing!

07:16.560 --> 07:20.560
Mrs Simon was supposed to receive 250
milligrams of penicillin, not 500.

07:22.120 --> 07:25.960
Now, next time make sure she gets
the correct dosage. Got it, Dick?

07:25.960 --> 07:27.760
Dr Craig, glad I bumped into you.

07:27.760 --> 07:28.840
       That makes one of us.

07:28.840 --> 07:32.600
Pru Dowler, mentally retarded, found
in flagrante with one of her chums

07:32.600 --> 07:34.800
after being admitted
                six weeks ago.

07:34.800 --> 07:38.440
I know the case. I had a chat with
her about social responsibility.

07:38.440 --> 07:42.000
I told her she couldn't
go about making love
whenever she pleased.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.880
You were a little late.
             She's pregnant.

07:43.880 --> 07:47.800
You were a little late.
             She's pregnant.
Pru Dowler can no more care
for a baby than I can give birth.

07:47.800 --> 07:51.360
That's how Pru's mother feels.
She signed the surgery consent form.

07:51.360 --> 07:53.520
We've scheduled an abortion
         for this afternoon.

07:53.520 --> 07:57.520
We've scheduled an abortion
         for this afternoon.
I'll look in on her.
Dick? Scram.

08:00.160 --> 08:01.680
        Good morning, Pru.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.240
Hello.

08:03.240 --> 08:04.920
I remember you.

08:04.920 --> 08:06.640
You wanna play my game with me?

08:06.640 --> 08:07.920
You wanna play my game with me?
     What have you got there?

08:07.920 --> 08:09.240
Wooly Willy!

08:09.240 --> 08:10.800
I'll show you how to play.

08:10.800 --> 08:14.800
See, first you
put the hair on, like this. &gt;

08:15.480 --> 08:19.240
And you put the whiskers, like this.

08:19.240 --> 08:21.840
And it's like drawing,
only it's different.

08:21.840 --> 08:24.160
There's you. &gt;

08:24.160 --> 08:25.720
               Nice.

08:25.720 --> 08:29.720
Now, is there anything you
wanna ask me about your operation?

08:29.920 --> 08:33.320
Yes. What's an operation?

08:33.320 --> 08:34.760
     Haven't you told her yet?

08:34.760 --> 08:38.159
     Haven't you told her yet?
No, sir.

08:38.159 --> 08:39.200
           Keep playing.

08:39.200 --> 08:43.200
Kiss me goodbye.

08:47.440 --> 08:49.240
  Morrison, you're the admitting.

08:49.240 --> 08:52.720
Mind explaining to me why you
haven't told Pru about the procedure?

08:52.720 --> 08:55.400
I don't believe in abortion.
     Taking innocent lives is wrong.

08:55.400 --> 08:57.800
You're not running
for town council here.

08:57.800 --> 09:01.800
I don't give a damn where you stand.
I'm not asking you
to perform the procedure.

09:01.960 --> 09:04.680
Simply explain to Pru
what will happen.

09:04.680 --> 09:07.080
I really don't want
anything to do with this.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.280
Oh, you are pathetic.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.880
Who's the surgeon?
I'll have him talk to her.

09:10.880 --> 09:13.960
Me, sir.

09:13.960 --> 09:17.120
On second thought,
I'm not gonna let you off that easy.

09:17.120 --> 09:21.120
Westphall might, but not me.
Talk to the girl.

09:23.120 --> 09:25.800
Why are you looking so stupid?

09:25.800 --> 09:29.800
No particular reason.

09:29.880 --> 09:31.600
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.440
But Jimmy, Jimmy, I already know.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.920
Jeff's principal just called
   from the school.

09:35.920 --> 09:39.160
Now listen, dear, I want you
to pick him up, take him home.

09:39.160 --> 09:42.280
And don't let him out of your sight.

09:42.280 --> 09:46.280
Oh, that's right. Well, what time
do you have to be at work?

09:46.480 --> 09:49.720
Well, I'll tell you what you do.
Bring him here to the hospital.

09:49.720 --> 09:51.720
Thank you, dear.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.000
Headache?

09:53.000 --> 09:55.920
Gimme the name of a good military
academy for my son Jeff.

09:55.920 --> 09:58.160
Things can't be that bad.

09:58.160 --> 09:59.760
This morning I found him
smoking a cigarette.

09:59.760 --> 10:01.840
This morning I found him
smoking a cigarette.
Boys will be boys.

10:01.840 --> 10:05.800
Then he starts waving
a stiletto around like he's
  Bernardo from West Side Story.

10:05.800 --> 10:09.320
As a lad, I remember playing
  mumblety-peg in Union Square Park.

10:09.320 --> 10:12.160
Then he nearly backed my car
through the garage doors.

10:12.160 --> 10:14.560
You might send him to
a child psychologist.

10:14.560 --> 10:17.640
I just found out he tried to
 pierce his ear with a thumbtack

10:17.640 --> 10:20.840
and then beat up the sixth-grade boy
who called him queer.

10:20.840 --> 10:24.840
Ellie Forge has
an excellent programme.
    There's Sheffield Academy.

10:25.240 --> 10:27.720
Oh, Daniel,
here are the DIGs you asked for.

10:27.720 --> 10:29.880
I'm going down
the Federal Courthouse.

10:29.880 --> 10:33.880
They moved Morena's asylum hearing
up. I don't know what the hell
I'm going to tell those people.

10:35.280 --> 10:37.000
You did engage counsel, didn't you?

10:37.000 --> 10:40.440
You did engage counsel, didn't you?
Yeah, I got Kenny Meyer.
He's the attorney for St Eligius.

10:40.440 --> 10:44.440
He's good. I saw him in action
when we removed life support
  from Sister Theresa.

10:45.280 --> 10:48.520
Maybe I should get a live-in maid
to help keep my house in order.

10:48.520 --> 10:51.640
Morena and Tommy have this
great relationship going now.

10:51.640 --> 10:54.000
If the INS sends her back
to El Salvador...

10:54.000 --> 10:55.120
  Her whole family was murdered.

10:55.120 --> 10:58.120
  Her whole family was murdered.
You've been railing against
the system a lot lately.

10:58.120 --> 11:01.120
Let Kenny Meyer handle the case.
Don't shoot from the hip.

11:01.120 --> 11:05.120
   I'll try to keep a lid on it.

11:05.840 --> 11:08.280
No chance.

Can I help you?

11:18.160 --> 11:20.440
I just need a signature.
Line through.

11:20.440 --> 11:23.480
The demonstrators outside
are pretty intimidating.

11:23.480 --> 11:27.480
You're just delivering a package.
Imagine how the women
who come here feel.

11:28.160 --> 11:29.680
God bless.

11:29.680 --> 11:32.160
OK. Uh, Janice,

11:32.160 --> 11:35.040
can you take this back
   to Gretchen for me? Thanks.

12:39.160 --> 12:42.400
SIRENS

12:42.400 --> 12:44.440
              Oh, no.

12:44.440 --> 12:46.320
One of the protesters.

12:46.320 --> 12:49.320
Minor lacerations sustained
when the window blew out.

12:49.320 --> 12:51.360
BP is 120/70. Heart rate's steady.

12:51.360 --> 12:53.280
She'll have to wait. Keep her stable.

12:53.280 --> 12:55.320
I've got my hands full
in Cubicle One.

12:55.320 --> 12:56.880
Heard anything about Phil?

12:56.880 --> 12:59.760
He said they're still
pulling bodies from the debris.

12:59.760 --> 13:03.760
I need some blood work here.
Lytes crit, type and cross
   for two units stat.

13:03.760 --> 13:05.200
Where's the crash cart?

13:05.200 --> 13:06.880
 Finished. Take her to the wards.

13:06.880 --> 13:09.680
One gram Q6 IV.
Check her crits in twelve hours.

13:09.680 --> 13:13.400
Alert ophthalmology. This woman
has blood in her anterior chamber.

13:13.400 --> 13:16.040
Never mind. Take her downstairs.

13:16.040 --> 13:17.840
Who set off this bomb? Pro-lifers?

13:17.840 --> 13:20.520
While marching around the building?
I doubt it.

13:20.520 --> 13:22.640
You guys see Dr Chandler
at the clinic?

13:22.640 --> 13:26.640
                No.

13:30.520 --> 13:33.720
I'd like to pray for your recovery.

13:33.720 --> 13:36.000
It will be healed.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.560
This one's pregnant.

13:37.560 --> 13:39.520
Fully dilated. Station minus four.

13:39.520 --> 13:42.880
Over here. Bud, you see Phil
Chandler down at the clinic?

13:42.880 --> 13:44.160
Uh, no, sorry.

13:44.160 --> 13:46.440
Take her upstairs.
Dr Moulden's waiting.

13:46.440 --> 13:48.160
Jackie, I need you over here.

13:48.160 --> 13:52.160
There's a psalm and scripture
that says the Lord knits us
together in our mother's womb.

13:52.720 --> 13:56.720
He sees our unformed body
 and knows us before we are born.

13:57.080 --> 13:59.680
     Come on, bear down. Push.

13:59.680 --> 14:03.440
Here's the head. Oh, hold on,
the cord's wrapped round the neck.

14:03.440 --> 14:06.280
OK! It's a girl!

14:06.280 --> 14:09.200
BABY CRIES

14:09.200 --> 14:13.120
Gretchen! I got my girl!

14:13.120 --> 14:15.160
People just keep on dying.

14:15.160 --> 14:17.360
The woman over here's gone into PAT.

14:17.360 --> 14:21.360
Her blood pressure is 80.

14:34.080 --> 14:36.360
Luther, what are you doing?

14:36.360 --> 14:37.560
What does it look like?

14:37.560 --> 14:38.720
What does it look like?
Reading?

14:38.720 --> 14:42.720
You've got it! This is
my paramedic training manual.
I study it every chance I get.

14:43.160 --> 14:44.880
Look, my car battery's dead.
I need some help.

14:44.880 --> 14:47.320
Look, my car battery's dead.
I need some help.
Me, too. Hold this.

14:47.320 --> 14:50.360
If you could rustle up some cables,
I could be on my way.

14:50.360 --> 14:54.360
Oh, well I'm having a big test next
week on cardiovascular physiology.

14:54.400 --> 14:56.960
Do think you could maybe
help me study some time?

14:56.960 --> 14:58.040
Sure, anything.

14:58.040 --> 15:00.160
Sure, anything.
Good. Oh, also,

15:00.160 --> 15:03.600
I'm having trouble reading the
rhythm strips on the cardioscope.

15:03.600 --> 15:05.480
You think you could maybe
give me a refresher course?

15:05.480 --> 15:09.480
You think you could maybe
give me a refresher course?
Yeah, no problem.

15:10.840 --> 15:13.800
Oh, you know what? I don't know
 when I'm gonna have time

15:13.800 --> 15:16.200
to take Julius to the vet.

15:16.200 --> 15:19.240
That's my racing pigeon.
He needs a physical.

15:19.240 --> 15:21.120
Isn't your father a vet?

15:21.120 --> 15:23.800
Yeah. I'll take Julius to my dad
for a check-up.

15:23.800 --> 15:27.800
Can we get my car started,
or is there anything else
    you'd like me to do?

15:27.960 --> 15:30.600
No, that's it.
Look, here's the keys to my place.

15:30.600 --> 15:33.040
You can go by and pick up
Julius any time.

15:33.040 --> 15:36.560
Now go outside and wait by your car.
I'll have it started in a jiffy.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.520
Go, go, go!

15:38.520 --> 15:41.120
&lt; Go, now!

15:41.120 --> 15:44.080
It'll be on the road again
in a minute.

15:44.080 --> 15:48.080
Go.

15:53.080 --> 15:54.920
Marty. Yeah, this is The Hawk.

15:54.920 --> 15:58.920
I gotta live one
with a dead battery.

16:01.480 --> 16:02.840
              Hi.  Hi.

16:02.840 --> 16:04.920
You wanna colour with me?

16:04.920 --> 16:07.960
No.

16:07.960 --> 16:11.160
I'm hungry. My stomach
keeps making funny noises.

16:11.160 --> 16:13.160
Why can't I have breakfast?

16:13.160 --> 16:14.560
The operation.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.160
I like pancakes.

16:16.160 --> 16:20.160
Yeah, me too.

16:20.200 --> 16:23.120
I've got something for you.

16:23.120 --> 16:24.400
For me?!

16:24.400 --> 16:28.400
Yeah. She needs a name.

16:32.280 --> 16:34.720
Pansy.

16:34.720 --> 16:38.720
That's nice.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.400
Do you know where babies come from?

16:41.400 --> 16:43.400
             From you.

16:43.400 --> 16:45.600
You gave me Pansy.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.480
Oh, no. No, babies...

16:48.480 --> 16:50.960
come from love.

16:50.960 --> 16:52.640
           You love me?

16:52.640 --> 16:53.880
               Kiss.

16:53.880 --> 16:57.720
No, Pru.

16:57.720 --> 17:01.120
Every month a woman get her period.

17:01.120 --> 17:05.079
My mummy tells me just
before it's going to happen,

17:05.079 --> 17:09.079
and I think she tells other women
so they won't be scared, too.

17:10.280 --> 17:14.280
Pru, you've got a baby
              in your belly.

17:15.359 --> 17:17.119
Must be why I'm hungry.

17:17.119 --> 17:20.880
Well, now, you see, you can't feel
the baby cos it's too small.

17:20.880 --> 17:23.160
How did the baby get there?

17:23.160 --> 17:24.599
Buddy.

17:24.599 --> 17:28.520
Buddy. I like Buddy.

17:28.520 --> 17:31.720
Well, your mother has asked us
  to take the baby out.

17:31.720 --> 17:35.720
Good! Then I can have
someone to play with Pansy!

17:35.880 --> 17:38.000
No.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.200
No, the baby's gonna
live in God's house.

17:40.200 --> 17:42.040
      How will it get there?

17:42.040 --> 17:45.840
Well...

17:45.840 --> 17:49.520
We're gonna take you to a room
with bright, bright lights

17:49.520 --> 17:51.840
and everybody's going
to be wearing masks.

17:51.840 --> 17:55.840
Like Hallowe'en?
Can I wear a mask, too?

17:56.280 --> 17:57.520
Sure.

17:57.520 --> 18:00.240
You look sad.
Don't be.

18:00.240 --> 18:04.240
   I'll take good care of Pansy.

18:09.360 --> 18:11.400
Hold still.

18:11.400 --> 18:15.400
You'll be lucky if your whole ear
doesn't get infected and fall off.

18:15.560 --> 18:18.000
You don't scare me,
saying stuff like that.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.960
I told you to stop
kicking your legs!

18:19.960 --> 18:23.440
You said hold still!

18:23.440 --> 18:25.720
Sit down here and do your homework.

18:25.720 --> 18:27.000
Don't have any.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.160
Don't have any.
Then read a book.

18:28.160 --> 18:29.480
Not till I get contacts.

18:29.480 --> 18:32.080
Now listen to me, Jeffrey,
I told you this morning

18:32.080 --> 18:35.000
I am very unhappy with the way
  you've been acting lately.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.520
Unless your behaviour changes,
 something terrible will happen!

18:38.520 --> 18:42.520
I'm quaking in my pants.

18:44.280 --> 18:46.240
   Getting married's a mistake.

18:46.240 --> 18:49.440
I don't know why I ever
proposed to Mona in the first place.

18:49.440 --> 18:51.520
I already have your gift picked out.

18:51.520 --> 18:53.760
Charbeque.
It's an oven, it's a grill.

18:53.760 --> 18:55.280
I'm not talking about grills. Girls.

18:55.280 --> 18:57.080
I'm not talking about grills. Girls.
Mona's a terrific specimen.

18:57.080 --> 19:00.440
Worked with her in the OR
hundreds of times. Well, four.

19:00.440 --> 19:04.040
Don't you think a wife should be a
little more than a good scrub nurse?

19:04.040 --> 19:08.040
Depends on what's getting scrubbed.

19:12.280 --> 19:16.280
      Who are you talking to?

19:19.080 --> 19:20.640
        You gonna be long?

19:20.640 --> 19:22.720
(Mark, please.)

19:22.720 --> 19:26.000
Are you responsible for the massacre
at the Women's Clinic?

19:26.000 --> 19:28.160
Don't hang up!

19:28.160 --> 19:30.880
Alissa, get me the police.

19:30.880 --> 19:33.720
 Daniel, who were you talking to?

19:33.720 --> 19:37.720
A man. Upset because we're
performing abortions at St Eligius.

19:38.520 --> 19:42.520
Said there's a bomb in the hospital.

19:48.280 --> 19:49.760
Are you nervous?

19:49.760 --> 19:50.960
Yes.

19:50.960 --> 19:52.120
Don't be.

19:52.120 --> 19:56.120
Once the judge hears the truth
about how you were tortured
and what happened to your family,

19:56.800 --> 19:59.560
they'll give you legal residency.
I know they will.

19:59.560 --> 20:03.160
You've been so good
to me, Dr Westphall.

20:03.160 --> 20:07.160
All these months since I escape
from my country I live in fear.

20:08.520 --> 20:11.600
I cannot sleep in
other people's beds

20:11.600 --> 20:14.120
and I'm tired of running.

20:14.120 --> 20:16.840
I want to stay with you
in your home.

20:16.840 --> 20:20.560
Your family is my family now.

20:20.560 --> 20:21.960
                            We're up.

20:21.960 --> 20:23.720
Any last-minute instructions?

20:23.720 --> 20:27.600
Yes. Remember, we're trying to prove
that Morena needs political asylum

20:27.600 --> 20:30.880
due to a well-founded fear of
persecution if she's deported.

20:30.880 --> 20:33.840
She's broken the law by entering
the country illegally,

20:33.840 --> 20:35.920
something the INS
takes a dim view of.

20:35.920 --> 20:38.360
Let me do the talking. Don't
turn this into a protest meeting.

20:38.360 --> 20:42.360
Let me do the talking. Don't
turn this into a protest meeting.
Fine.

20:54.720 --> 20:58.720
Julius, Julius, Julius!

21:01.960 --> 21:04.880
I'm sorry
   Dad couldn't see you today.

21:04.880 --> 21:07.040
What is it gonna take
to make you shut up?

21:07.040 --> 21:10.480
I draped the towel over your
birdcage, I turned on the radio,

21:10.480 --> 21:13.520
I've got you plenty of food to eat.

21:13.520 --> 21:17.480
I don't treat my Uncle Fritz
this well when he comes to visit!

21:17.480 --> 21:19.520
I'll make you a bird bath.

21:19.520 --> 21:23.520
You'll like that.

21:24.800 --> 21:28.800
This should keep you quiet.

21:35.480 --> 21:37.200
Perfect.

21:37.200 --> 21:39.360
OK.

21:39.360 --> 21:42.600
OK, Julius.

21:42.600 --> 21:46.480
There you go.
Ooh, you're gonna love this.

21:46.480 --> 21:50.480
Let go. There you go.

21:51.480 --> 21:55.200
OK.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.480
Ooh, you're gonna love this.

21:57.480 --> 21:59.280
Feels good.

21:59.280 --> 22:03.280
Eugh! I don't trust you
to be around my toothbrush.

22:08.640 --> 22:12.640
ELECTRICITY CRACKLES

22:16.880 --> 22:20.560
He said because we performed
abortions at St Eligius

22:20.560 --> 22:24.080
there must be retribution. The
born must die to save the unborn.

22:24.080 --> 22:25.680
That is rich.

22:25.680 --> 22:28.600
What kind of bomb
might he have planted?

22:28.600 --> 22:32.600
The evidence shows the bomb at
the Women's Clinic was homemade -
black powder packed in iron pipes.

22:33.880 --> 22:35.680
But this could all be a hoax.

22:35.680 --> 22:39.680
If there is a bomb, how could it
be detonated? Timer, remote control?

22:40.440 --> 22:44.000
Might even be rigged to a wall
switch or an elevator button.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.080
This gets better and better(!)
Where the blazes is Donald?

22:47.080 --> 22:49.280
First he disappears
during the blackout

22:49.280 --> 22:51.320
and now he's pulled
a disappearing act.

22:51.320 --> 22:53.720
Donald's at Marina's
immigration hearing.

22:53.720 --> 22:55.480
He's worried
about a clean house

22:55.480 --> 22:57.760
and we're about to
be blown to kingdom come!

22:57.760 --> 23:00.960
The real question is
   do we evacuate the hospital?

23:00.960 --> 23:03.200
What about clearing one
section at a time?

23:03.200 --> 23:06.040
Putting the patients in other
parts of the building?

23:06.040 --> 23:07.640
And hope you're not moving
them closer to the bomb.

23:07.640 --> 23:09.240
And hope you're not moving
them closer to the bomb.
How long will your search be?

23:09.240 --> 23:10.320
At least two hours.

23:10.320 --> 23:14.320
There is no way that we can move
half our patients in that time.

23:15.440 --> 23:19.080
We have people in the ICU who can't
stand the strain of being moved.

23:19.080 --> 23:21.560
They could be dead before
we hit the front door!

23:21.560 --> 23:22.880
   My vote is that we stay put.

23:22.880 --> 23:24.080
   My vote is that we stay put.
I have to agree.

23:24.080 --> 23:26.360
My suggestion would be
      not to tell the staff

23:26.360 --> 23:27.920
or you  risk inciting a panic.

23:27.920 --> 23:31.920
However, we cancel all visiting
hours until this crisis is resolved.

23:32.320 --> 23:36.320
Well excuse me, I'm going to
double-check the OR area myself.

23:39.680 --> 23:43.680
PHONE RINGS

23:44.640 --> 23:46.640
Go ahead, Dr Auschlander, answer it.

23:46.640 --> 23:50.640
I'll be listening to cue you.

23:52.040 --> 23:56.040
Dr Auschlander.

23:56.760 --> 24:00.760
My granddaughter Jessica.

24:06.360 --> 24:09.040
The next session will be better.

24:09.040 --> 24:11.280
     Oh, what a waste of time!

24:11.280 --> 24:13.920
Jeff!
Wait for me in the nurses' lounge.

24:13.920 --> 24:17.920
Whoever heard of a 45 minute hour!

24:18.200 --> 24:20.840
So, now you've met my youngest.

24:20.840 --> 24:22.600
What did Jeff say about me?

24:22.600 --> 24:26.600
That you would want
 to know what he said about you.

24:27.280 --> 24:28.560
He's a bright boy.

24:28.560 --> 24:32.160
Yes. Right now I'd trade
him in for a dumber model.

24:32.160 --> 24:33.840
What bothers you about Jeff.

24:33.840 --> 24:37.120
Sulking, drinking,
lies, being disrespectful.

24:37.120 --> 24:38.440
Why does that bother you?

24:38.440 --> 24:40.640
Well, I don't
want Jeff to hurt himself,

24:40.640 --> 24:44.480
and I don't like having to punish,
and I don't like raising a jerk.

24:44.480 --> 24:46.840
Doesn't sound like
you're asking for much.

24:46.840 --> 24:49.640
After four kids I expect a certain
amount of trouble,

24:49.640 --> 24:51.400
but this one's exceeded the limit.

24:51.400 --> 24:53.520
Oh, I wouldn't give up on him yet.

24:53.520 --> 24:55.040
What do I do?

24:55.040 --> 24:59.000
You continue to exert your authority
as a parent and he will continue

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
to exert his independence
    as a child.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.080
Then, in time,
      you work through this.

25:03.080 --> 25:04.840
And if nothing changes?

25:04.840 --> 25:08.840
You're raising a jerk.

25:12.560 --> 25:16.560
Did you read the most recent
journal stats? 4,000 abortions a day.

25:17.520 --> 25:19.520
That's three - every minute.
That's godless.

25:19.520 --> 25:21.720
That's three - every minute.
That's godless.
You can't stop unwanted pregnancies.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.600
I've got enough on my mind.

25:23.600 --> 25:26.120
If I make this, the wedding's off.

25:26.120 --> 25:27.760
OK, two out of three.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.640
After Kentucky-frying Julius,

25:29.640 --> 25:32.920
I went back to sleep and I had this
nightmare that I killed Big Bird.

25:32.920 --> 25:36.920
This angry mob of kids was
chasing me down Sesame Street.

25:37.480 --> 25:41.040
You've got couples
lost in a moment of passion,

25:41.040 --> 25:45.040
inconvenienced by birth control,
and they can see the light.

25:45.280 --> 25:48.320
What about the two million
conceptions that are a result

25:48.320 --> 25:50.560
of failed birth control? What about
the victims of incest and rape?

25:50.560 --> 25:51.920
of failed birth control? What about
the victims of incest and rape?
      There's no easy answer.

25:51.920 --> 25:55.920
You think so! No abortions, except
when a mother's life's in danger.

25:56.560 --> 25:59.320
Every human being has got
a right to life.

25:59.320 --> 26:02.040
With abortion,
we've made killing acceptable

26:02.040 --> 26:03.640
  when there are other options -

26:03.640 --> 26:06.800
carrying the baby to term,
putting the baby up for adoption.

26:06.800 --> 26:08.160
Just like that.

26:08.160 --> 26:11.000
What about children who'd
be deformed or handicapped?

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
The problem most disabled
people suffer is from living
with the rest of us.

26:15.120 --> 26:19.120
What if Pru's mother had known
that Pru was gonna be retarded?

26:19.360 --> 26:20.400
 Would that give her the right...?

26:20.400 --> 26:24.120
 Would that give her the right...?
The decision should be made
by the mother, not by you or me...

26:24.120 --> 26:27.520
Somebody has got to stand up for
those who can't defend themselves.

26:27.520 --> 26:29.680
You have an obligation
as a doctor to Pru,

26:29.680 --> 26:31.760
regardless of your personal beliefs.

26:31.760 --> 26:33.720
Otherwise you're
denying her medical care!

26:33.720 --> 26:37.600
Otherwise you're
denying her medical care!
And imposing your
beliefs on somebody else.

26:37.600 --> 26:40.040
I didn't kill
  an innocent man's pet pigeon.

26:40.040 --> 26:42.000
I can understand
        Luther getting mad

26:42.000 --> 26:44.880
if Julius was a dog
or a cat or something like that.

26:44.880 --> 26:47.600
Luther used to stick his face
right up against that bird.

26:47.600 --> 26:49.400
I didn't mean to kill him.

26:49.400 --> 26:52.440
He would nuzzle his
nose under Julius's wing.

26:52.440 --> 26:55.920
It's a stupid, lice-infested,
encephalitis-carrying pigeon!

26:55.920 --> 26:57.320
Luther will give that bird

26:57.320 --> 27:00.120
a proper burial and then
he'll give you one, too.

27:00.120 --> 27:01.520
What should I do?  Tell the truth.

27:01.520 --> 27:04.080
Are you kidding?!
It would be Murder She Wrote!

27:04.080 --> 27:07.120
OK, six out of ten.

27:07.120 --> 27:08.720
Knew I shouldn't get married.

27:08.720 --> 27:11.960
OK, lie. Tell Luther Julius
flew out through an open window.

27:11.960 --> 27:15.960
Oi.

27:16.120 --> 27:18.040
             Dr Craig.

27:18.040 --> 27:20.840
Two weeks since you've
   been off my team and you've

27:20.840 --> 27:23.080
forgotten how to scrub.
Shape up.

27:23.080 --> 27:26.920
Elbows in, wrists up,
start with the fingers, work down.

27:26.920 --> 27:28.560
     What are you doing here?

27:28.560 --> 27:31.440
I don't have to answer to you!
I'm Chief of Surgery.

27:31.440 --> 27:35.360
That you are. You're an amazing man.
I've always tried to emulate you.

27:35.360 --> 27:37.440
Oh, don't try that froufrou on me.

27:37.440 --> 27:39.200
You're on the dark side of my moon.

27:39.200 --> 27:41.480
             Yes, sir.

27:41.480 --> 27:44.120
Any idea how Morrison's
talk went with Pru?

27:44.120 --> 27:46.280
Said he had trouble
getting through to her.

27:46.280 --> 27:48.680
Yeah, I guessed.
No communication skills.

27:48.680 --> 27:51.520
The man would have trouble
ordering dinner in a restaurant.

27:51.520 --> 27:54.160
Oh, for crying out loud.

27:54.160 --> 27:55.160
        Well, who are you?

27:55.160 --> 27:57.800
        Well, who are you?
Miaow.

27:57.800 --> 28:01.080
I'm a kitty.
My mommy let me use her make-up.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.000
Who are you supposed to be?

28:03.000 --> 28:04.800
           Una momento?

28:04.800 --> 28:07.600
Mona,
a little surgical marker, please.

28:07.600 --> 28:10.120
Ehrlich, is this one
    of your half-baked ideas?

28:10.120 --> 28:12.520
Oh, no, sir, it's completely baked.

28:12.520 --> 28:15.080
It's a Halloween party.

28:15.080 --> 28:16.880
How are you feeling?

28:16.880 --> 28:18.400
Sleepy.

28:18.400 --> 28:22.400
I want you to try on another mask.

28:25.040 --> 28:25.760
How do I look?

28:25.760 --> 28:28.160
How do I look?
Oh, like a space woman.

28:28.160 --> 28:31.720
It's a time night-night.

28:31.720 --> 28:32.760
              Ta-da!

28:32.760 --> 28:36.760
Get started, Ehrlich.

28:39.280 --> 28:40.480
              Coffee?

28:40.480 --> 28:42.840
No, thanks.
I have to get back to work.

28:42.840 --> 28:44.320
You'll be all right here alone?

28:44.320 --> 28:47.240
               Yes.

28:47.240 --> 28:49.280
Now look, Marina.

28:49.280 --> 28:52.120
Today was just the first
round, you understand?

28:52.120 --> 28:54.720
We'll appeal this.
We won't let them send you back.

28:54.720 --> 28:56.560
         You're very kind.

28:56.560 --> 28:59.240
I still believe in American justice.

28:59.240 --> 29:00.600
It's not the best system,

29:00.600 --> 29:02.840
but if we try,
    it'll work out in the end.

29:02.840 --> 29:05.120
           I understand.

29:05.120 --> 29:09.120
I see the Statue of Liberty on
television and they're fixing it

29:10.160 --> 29:12.240
     for 100-year celebration.

29:12.240 --> 29:15.080
It's the symbol of American freedom.
I send some money.

29:15.080 --> 29:18.920
Well, I shouldn't have lost my
temper in court. That was dumb.

29:18.920 --> 29:20.920
      You go to the hospital.

29:20.920 --> 29:22.000
You sure you're all right?

29:22.000 --> 29:23.240
You sure you're all right?
               Yes.

29:23.240 --> 29:27.240
I'm gonna go change my shirt.

30:10.800 --> 30:12.600
  Mom, how'd it to go with Simon?

30:12.600 --> 30:16.600
Dr Weiss to you.

30:16.720 --> 30:19.000
You're really mad at me, aren't you?

30:19.000 --> 30:20.680
How could you do this to me?

30:20.680 --> 30:22.320
        Oh, cool your jets.

30:22.320 --> 30:24.520
Jeff! You listen to me.

30:24.520 --> 30:27.280
Dr Weiss says he thinks
we can work through this.

30:27.280 --> 30:29.200
I hope so but,
       I want to tell you,

30:29.200 --> 30:33.200
if you continue to make my
life miserable, I will have
   nothing to do with you.

30:33.240 --> 30:36.160
So you figure that out.

30:36.160 --> 30:37.480
Mom...
What?

30:37.480 --> 30:40.880
          Can I hug you?

30:40.880 --> 30:44.880
I'd like that.

30:45.920 --> 30:49.920
I feel better already.

30:51.640 --> 30:53.680
        Mona, I need the...

30:53.680 --> 30:55.280
Suction catheter.

30:55.280 --> 30:59.280
You're a doozy of a nurse, Mona, not
to mention a beautiful bride to be.

31:00.080 --> 31:02.520
Did I hear correctly?
You're betrothed?

31:02.520 --> 31:04.760
It looks that way.

31:04.760 --> 31:06.400
Don't sound too sure.

31:06.400 --> 31:10.120
Well, I'm not, actually. Wayne's
a really great guy and all, but...

31:10.120 --> 31:13.120
Fiscus? You're going
    to marry that bubble head?

31:13.120 --> 31:15.160
During the blackout
    it seemed the thing to do.

31:15.160 --> 31:17.600
And now that you've
seen him in the light...

31:17.600 --> 31:20.360
Let's say there's still time
  to bail before the ship sails.

31:20.360 --> 31:21.600
Right, Dr Craig?

31:21.600 --> 31:22.800
'Atta girl.

31:22.800 --> 31:25.960
The tissue from inside
the uterus has been recovered.

31:25.960 --> 31:29.960
The specimen will now be sent to
pathology, examined and disposed of.

31:30.480 --> 31:32.080
Check for residual bleeding

31:32.080 --> 31:34.160
then make sure Pru
gets back to her room.

31:34.160 --> 31:37.920
Yes, sir. Dr Craig, whatever
you're looking for, can I help?

31:37.920 --> 31:41.920
Oh, sure, Ehrlich.
And when you find it, sit on it.

31:50.200 --> 31:54.200
DOG BARKS

31:57.640 --> 32:01.640
Sit, sit.

32:48.240 --> 32:49.520
Bottom's cut out.

32:49.520 --> 32:53.520
Bomb's in there. Clear the hall!

33:53.760 --> 33:55.960
Third floor nurses' station.

33:55.960 --> 33:59.960
No, I'm sorry, visiting hours
have been temporarily cancelled.

33:59.960 --> 34:02.800
Call again in a few hours.

34:02.800 --> 34:05.440
The ice machine is broken.
  You better call a serviceman.

34:05.440 --> 34:08.159
Helen, Mr Kirkland's
not responding to diuretics.

34:08.159 --> 34:11.040
I'm switching him
to furosemide, 160mgs.

34:11.040 --> 34:13.600
One at a time, please.

34:13.600 --> 34:16.560
Ma, I can't believe this
     is what you do all day.

34:16.560 --> 34:18.480
Your job stinks.

34:18.480 --> 34:20.920
Perhaps this isn't a
good day for Jeffrey here.

34:20.920 --> 34:22.159
      Why not take him home?

34:22.159 --> 34:24.960
You're Dr Auschlander, right?

34:24.960 --> 34:27.040
Liver cancer,
should have died years ago.

34:27.040 --> 34:30.520
Mom complained about you a
lot during the nurses' strike.

34:30.520 --> 34:32.719
Said you were a dinosaur,
    old-fashioned.

34:32.719 --> 34:36.719
She doubts you
  ever had a full head of hair.

34:37.600 --> 34:40.400
Get down! Listen to me!

34:40.400 --> 34:42.880
How dare you speak to
    Dr Auschlander like that.

34:42.880 --> 34:46.400
Betraying my confidence,
embarrassing me in
front of the people I work with.

34:46.400 --> 34:46.920
Big deal!

34:46.920 --> 34:48.120
Big deal!
Be quiet. Listen to me.

34:48.120 --> 34:51.000
You're going to sit here
    and not say one more word.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.360
Go to hell!  Jeffrey!

34:52.360 --> 34:55.400
Who wants to stick around a hospital
with a bomb in it.

34:55.400 --> 34:58.200
        Helen, let him go.

34:58.200 --> 35:02.160
Oh... I feel so stupid.

35:02.160 --> 35:04.840
My other kids have
been warning me about

35:04.840 --> 35:07.240
a problem that I've been ignoring.

35:07.240 --> 35:08.480
Since his father left,

35:08.480 --> 35:12.080
I've handled Jeff differently,
but nothing works.
  He's out of control.

35:12.080 --> 35:15.440
Jeff's testing you, testing himself.
It's part of growing up.

35:15.440 --> 35:19.160
The trick's to keep things in check.

35:19.160 --> 35:21.440
You see how he responds
     to authority.

35:21.440 --> 35:25.320
My father had a way of fixing
my wagon. An old fashioned paddling.

35:25.320 --> 35:27.360
Oh, I've never
    spanked a kid in my life.

35:27.360 --> 35:29.240
It's against everything
     I believe in.

35:29.240 --> 35:31.840
       You're Jeff's parent.

35:31.840 --> 35:33.120
      He's got to know that.

35:33.120 --> 35:37.000
If you don't respond now,
some day he'll push all
of your buttons

35:37.000 --> 35:41.000
and you'll lose control.
That's not what punishment's about.

35:46.240 --> 35:47.880
KNOCK ON DOOR

35:47.880 --> 35:50.360
Elliott?
Open up. &gt;

35:50.360 --> 35:51.440
             Coming...

35:51.440 --> 35:54.360
What's so important that you
couldn't tell me over the phone? &gt;

35:54.360 --> 35:55.920
       I'll be right there.

35:55.920 --> 35:59.120
Hurry up, Elliott. &gt;

35:59.120 --> 36:00.600
        Want a pina colada?

36:00.600 --> 36:02.920
No, and I don't have much time!

36:02.920 --> 36:06.080
I'm supposed to be
taking a patient down to radiology.

36:06.080 --> 36:09.200
It's about Julius.
He was pacing around in his cage like

36:09.200 --> 36:11.560
   he had no chance for parole,

36:11.560 --> 36:14.720
so I opened up the cage to let him
like stretch his wings a bit.

36:14.720 --> 36:16.160
Well, where is he?

36:16.160 --> 36:20.160
Last time I saw him
he was in here, but he's gone.

36:20.440 --> 36:22.960
   Luther, he's flown the coop.

36:22.960 --> 36:24.080
Julius?

36:24.080 --> 36:26.360
He was sailing around
my apartment before

36:26.360 --> 36:28.320
  I realised the window was open.

36:28.320 --> 36:31.080
Hey, don't worry.

36:31.080 --> 36:32.800
          But he's gone.

36:32.800 --> 36:36.360
Elliott, he's a homing pigeon.
He'll be back.

36:36.360 --> 36:40.160
But it's cold outside.
I mean, his wings iced up.

36:40.160 --> 36:42.960
      Snow clogged his radar.

36:42.960 --> 36:44.480
Julius...

36:44.480 --> 36:48.480
           What's wrong?

36:52.600 --> 36:55.360
He must have landed there,

36:55.360 --> 36:57.680
and froze to death,

36:57.680 --> 37:01.080
warming down from his flight.

37:01.080 --> 37:05.080
He was always flying
       that extra mile,

37:05.240 --> 37:09.240
pushing himself to the limit.

37:11.320 --> 37:15.320
That's why he soared like an eagle.

37:16.760 --> 37:18.280
Wait, I want to get out!

37:18.280 --> 37:19.920
Where the hell have you been?

37:19.920 --> 37:21.360
Back there the whole time.

37:21.360 --> 37:23.400
You would have known that if you
checked your mirror.

37:23.400 --> 37:26.080
You would have known that if you
checked your mirror.
That was stupid running
     away like that.

37:26.080 --> 37:28.600
You're not exactly
the smartest person I know.

37:28.600 --> 37:31.080
This has got to stop,
      the disobedience!

37:31.080 --> 37:32.400
The talking back to me!

37:32.400 --> 37:35.200
Do you understand? You're going
 to start listening, damn it!

37:35.200 --> 37:37.960
You're crazy!
First you hit that nurse at work...

37:37.960 --> 37:39.240
You needed this!

37:39.240 --> 37:41.760
Then why can't you be
normal like other kids' moms?!

37:41.760 --> 37:44.760
I'm sorry if you don't like the way
things are run around here,

37:44.760 --> 37:46.000
but I'm still
     the head of this house.

37:46.000 --> 37:50.000
but I'm still
     the head of this house.
I want to live with my dad.

37:59.160 --> 38:02.640
Mona!
I was just on my way up to see you.

38:02.640 --> 38:03.880
         We need to talk.

38:03.880 --> 38:04.920
Yeah...

38:04.920 --> 38:08.920
Look, that night during the blackout,
I was so scared.

38:09.480 --> 38:12.120
    And you were so reassuring.

38:12.120 --> 38:16.120
The time we spent in a storage
room was really special. Romantic.

38:16.160 --> 38:19.000
Look, if you don't want to
get married, you just say so.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.440
  You don't want to get married.

38:20.440 --> 38:21.520
No, that's not true.

38:21.520 --> 38:23.000
Then why are you on
your way up to see me?

38:23.000 --> 38:26.680
Then why are you on
your way up to see me?
Because...do I need a
reason to talk to my fiancee?

38:26.680 --> 38:29.000
    Ex. I knew you'd back out.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Then why'd you tell your parents?

38:31.000 --> 38:32.920
 I never even picked up the phone.

38:32.920 --> 38:35.400
Because you had no
intention of marrying me.

38:35.400 --> 38:38.120
All you think about is being
Craig's stooge in the OR.

38:38.120 --> 38:39.680
And if we did get married,
you'd have no time for me.

38:39.680 --> 38:43.680
And if we did get married,
you'd have no time for me.
What about you?! The hot shot doctor
who spends every minute in the ER.

38:43.760 --> 38:46.760
Marriage is 100%, all or
nothing, lifetime commitment.

38:46.760 --> 38:47.960
Don't you think I know that?  No!

38:47.960 --> 38:50.920
The next time you ask someone to be
your wife, make sure you mean it!

38:50.920 --> 38:54.920
Mona... I hate this... Mona, wait!

38:56.760 --> 39:00.440
Luther,
I'm carrying around a lot of guilt.

39:00.440 --> 39:02.880
So bounce into McCabe chapel.

39:02.880 --> 39:05.160
 No, I have to tell you something.

39:05.160 --> 39:08.560
Not now, Elliott, OK, I just
lost my best friend today.

39:08.560 --> 39:11.440
I killed Julius. It was an accident.
I was making him a bird bath

39:11.440 --> 39:13.920
and the radio fell in
and he got electrocuted.

39:13.920 --> 39:15.720
But he was on the window ledge.

39:15.720 --> 39:19.720
I tried to make you think
that he'd frozen to death.

39:21.360 --> 39:23.280
Do you think he felt any pain?

39:23.280 --> 39:25.120
Uh-uh, It was 30 amps, straight up.

39:25.120 --> 39:28.400
I even had to replace
the blown fuse afterwards.

39:28.400 --> 39:32.400
Maybe it was all for the best.

39:34.440 --> 39:37.200
You're right, Julius was decrepit.

39:37.200 --> 39:38.760
He was valiant.

39:38.760 --> 39:42.240
Luther, he was 210 years old
in people years.

39:42.240 --> 39:44.360
    Ask my father, he's a vet.

39:44.360 --> 39:47.240
I found Julius on the mall,
in the arms of Paul Revere.

39:47.240 --> 39:51.200
You know the statue.
It was raining and he was sick.

39:51.200 --> 39:53.760
And I took him home and fed him
 with an eye dropper.

39:53.760 --> 39:55.440
Let him live in my closet.

39:55.440 --> 39:58.520
Luther, face it,
his racing days were over.

39:58.520 --> 40:00.400
I nursed Julius back to health

40:00.400 --> 40:04.400
and then in return he gave me
loyalty and companionship.

40:09.240 --> 40:13.240
You know, Luther,
Julius had one, maybe two years left.

40:14.280 --> 40:16.600
Pigeons know when it's their time.

40:16.600 --> 40:19.680
They stop eating or they
find the wall and fly into it.

40:19.680 --> 40:23.680
But you know, Julius dying in
a flash, I mean, a shower of sparks.

40:23.800 --> 40:27.800
Besides, now you can concentrate
on your paramedic training.

40:27.960 --> 40:30.840
You can forget about all this
pigeon racing stuff.

40:30.840 --> 40:33.760
Julius flew his heart out for me.

40:33.760 --> 40:37.360
And I loved him.

40:37.360 --> 40:41.360
 Luther, he was just a dumb bird.

40:44.080 --> 40:46.600
I trusted you! I trusted you
   to take care of Julius,

40:46.600 --> 40:49.320
not play the executioner's song!

40:49.320 --> 40:53.320
I won't forget you for this,
   Axelrod!

40:54.200 --> 40:55.680
Elliott, are you all right?

40:55.680 --> 40:59.680
       Yeah. I'm all right.

41:03.040 --> 41:04.160
              Thanks.

41:04.160 --> 41:08.160
Here.

42:15.440 --> 42:19.200
Yeah. &gt;

42:19.200 --> 42:20.760
Hey, Jack, what can I do for you?

42:20.760 --> 42:22.440
       You're busy, I'll...

42:22.440 --> 42:23.760
Come in.
If I talk to you,

42:23.760 --> 42:27.760
I won't think about what I'm eating.

42:32.840 --> 42:33.920
How's little Pete?

42:33.920 --> 42:36.640
He's fine, he's got
another birthday coming up.

42:36.640 --> 42:39.360
Must be getting to be
quite a handful, isn't he?

42:39.360 --> 42:41.080
           How's Tommy?

42:41.080 --> 42:43.960
He's all right.
I had to bring him to the hospital,

42:43.960 --> 42:45.560
he's asleep in on call.

42:45.560 --> 42:48.880
          Where's Marina?

42:48.880 --> 42:52.880
She's gone.

42:53.520 --> 42:56.520
You ever think about
going back to Ethiopia?

42:56.520 --> 42:59.480
I'll tell you something,
if I didn't have those pictures

42:59.480 --> 43:01.280
to remind me,

43:01.280 --> 43:03.640
it would seem like
I'd never been there.

43:03.640 --> 43:07.320
You know, I thought I'd changed
 when I went over there.

43:07.320 --> 43:10.480
I thought the experience
   of that had made me stronger

43:10.480 --> 43:13.040
and wiser, more committed.

43:13.040 --> 43:16.280
I really thought that I could
 pull that sword out of the stone

43:16.280 --> 43:18.360
and fix what was broken
     in the world.

43:18.360 --> 43:19.920
You fight
for what you believe in.

43:19.920 --> 43:22.440
I was asked to do something
today that I thought

43:22.440 --> 43:26.440
was morally wrong
and instead of standing up,

43:26.520 --> 43:30.520
          I surrendered.

43:30.880 --> 43:33.000
I'm the same guy
       I was before I left.

43:33.000 --> 43:37.000
When I was a kid, I played
    out by Flannery's pub.

43:39.040 --> 43:42.600
Pretty good fielder, couldn't hit.

43:42.600 --> 43:46.600
And every time I'd strike out,
I'd cry.

43:46.800 --> 43:50.800
Well, I'm still a bad loser.

43:51.240 --> 43:54.760
Sometimes it just doesn't
matter what we do, Jack.

43:54.760 --> 43:57.840
One man should be able
to make a difference.

43:57.840 --> 44:01.840
Well, not tonight.

44:02.960 --> 44:05.120
But I guess as long
       as we're breathing,

44:05.120 --> 44:07.440
we get another chance at bat, right?

44:07.440 --> 44:08.400
You hungry?

44:08.400 --> 44:12.400
You hungry?
      Well, actually... Yeah.

44:14.800 --> 44:18.800
Here you go.

45:04.760 --> 45:14.000
