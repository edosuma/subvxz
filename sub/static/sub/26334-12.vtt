WEBVTT

00:05.614 --> 00:07.703
Good morning.

00:13.883 --> 00:15.711
Sir?

00:17.452 --> 00:19.280
I need two minutes
with him.

00:19.323 --> 00:20.542
He's not here.

00:20.585 --> 00:22.239
Well, when he's back
from wherever he is.

00:22.283 --> 00:24.894
He didn't have an early
appointment on the books, so...

00:26.026 --> 00:28.158
What?

00:28.202 --> 00:32.423
Text from Nuciforo.
The boss ditched his detail.

00:34.599 --> 00:37.559
On the last court date,
the defendant pled guilty

00:37.602 --> 00:40.214
to vehicular manslaughter
in the second degree.

00:40.257 --> 00:41.998
A.D.A. Reagan,
what's your recommendation?

00:42.042 --> 00:44.218
Prior to my recommendation,
Your Honor,

00:44.261 --> 00:46.263
the mother of the deceased,
Maureen Lee,

00:46.307 --> 00:47.830
would like to deliver
a victim impact statement

00:47.873 --> 00:50.093
to the court.JUDGE: Yes.

00:50.137 --> 00:51.790
Mrs. Lee?

00:56.969 --> 01:00.321
My son Jackson was a curious
and funny four-year-old boy

01:00.364 --> 01:03.324
that brought our family
so much joy and laughter.

01:03.367 --> 01:08.111
He liked to tackle his dad,
get slime all over my house,

01:08.155 --> 01:09.939
and sing loudly in the car

01:09.982 --> 01:12.376
to his favorite song,
"Baby Shark."

01:12.420 --> 01:15.031
Jackson was playing
outside of our home

01:15.075 --> 01:18.600
on a beautiful Sunday morning
when he was struck and killed

01:18.643 --> 01:21.298
by this reckless teenage driver.

01:21.342 --> 01:23.822
Samantha Wright likes to party,

01:23.866 --> 01:26.869
and on this night, she was
partying into the early morning

01:26.912 --> 01:31.265
before she decided
to take a joy ride...

01:31.308 --> 01:35.399
a decision that has taken our
Jackson away from us forever;

01:35.443 --> 01:38.141
that has made me wonder
if God gave me

01:38.185 --> 01:39.490
four years of laughter

01:39.534 --> 01:42.189
because I'll spend the rest
of my life crying.

01:42.232 --> 01:45.627
JUDGE:
Thank you, Mrs. Lee.

01:47.455 --> 01:51.067
A.D.A. Reagan, what's your
position on sentencing?

01:51.111 --> 01:54.462
Your Honor, the defendant
deserves significant jail time.

01:54.505 --> 01:56.159
We recommend
the maximum sentence

01:56.203 --> 01:57.334
for the crime she committed.

01:57.378 --> 01:59.597
If that's all...Your Honor,

01:59.641 --> 02:01.556
I have something.

02:01.599 --> 02:02.644
May we approach?

02:02.687 --> 02:04.341
JUDGE:
Okay, Counsel.

02:08.563 --> 02:10.608
We've just completed a
psychiatric report that we think

02:10.652 --> 02:12.436
should be taken
into consideration

02:12.480 --> 02:14.177
before we determine
Samantha Wright's sentencing.

02:14.221 --> 02:15.178
You've had months

02:15.222 --> 02:16.266
to bring this to our attention.

02:16.310 --> 02:18.181
You're choosing today
at sentencing?

02:18.225 --> 02:19.356
It was newly brought
to my attention

02:19.400 --> 02:20.357
by my client's family.

02:20.401 --> 02:22.577
Let's take a recess.

02:22.620 --> 02:25.362
We've already delayed sentencing
long enough, Your Honor.

02:25.406 --> 02:26.929
So all parties can take a look
at the new evidence,

02:26.972 --> 02:30.062
yourself included,
A.D.A. Reagan.

02:30.106 --> 02:31.412
What have we got?

02:31.455 --> 02:33.370
Detectives.
Officer Walsh.

02:33.414 --> 02:35.285
Detective Reagan,
my partner, Detective Baez.

02:35.329 --> 02:37.418
Really nice to meet you.

02:37.461 --> 02:39.071
Okay, what do we got?Uh, right.

02:39.115 --> 02:41.422
The, uh, victim is Wayne Brown.

02:41.465 --> 02:43.554
He was found by the
janitor this morning.

02:43.598 --> 02:46.035
It looks like he was
practicing out here alone

02:46.078 --> 02:47.384
when he was attacked.

02:47.428 --> 02:49.125
Looks like there was
a struggle.

02:49.169 --> 02:52.346
Probably somebody he knew,
not a stranger.

02:52.389 --> 02:53.782
Any of the other players around?

02:53.825 --> 02:55.523
Yeah, yeah, they all started
coming in for practice.

02:55.566 --> 02:58.352
I got 'em waiting
in the locker room.
I can show you.

02:58.395 --> 03:00.092
I still can't believe
I responded to the homicide

03:00.136 --> 03:01.529
of someone I know.

03:01.572 --> 03:03.095
You knew the vic?

03:03.139 --> 03:05.010
Not like knowhim know him.

03:05.054 --> 03:07.187
I'm a-- I'm a big fan
of the team.

03:07.230 --> 03:09.232
Uh-huh.
Where is the team?

03:09.276 --> 03:11.582
This way.

03:11.626 --> 03:12.888
So, the team's good?

03:12.931 --> 03:15.456
Good? No, no, no. Great.

03:15.499 --> 03:17.806
New York City hasn't had
a team this good in years.

03:17.849 --> 03:19.851
We were bound for the playoffs,
everyone thought it.

03:19.895 --> 03:21.897
I've been tracking
Joshua Taylor

03:21.940 --> 03:23.855
and some of these other guys
since AAU ball.

03:23.899 --> 03:25.292
Who's Joshua Taylor?

03:25.335 --> 03:27.642
Uh, he's the captain
of the team.

03:27.685 --> 03:30.122
Great high school player,
got better in college.

03:30.166 --> 03:31.515
Thanks.Is expected to be even better...

03:31.559 --> 03:35.476
Hey, you know what,
I think we got it from here.

03:43.527 --> 03:45.268
Everything okay there,
Officer?

03:45.312 --> 03:46.704
If I'm being honest?

03:46.748 --> 03:48.271
That'd be a good place
to start.

03:48.315 --> 03:50.447
I don't need some young guy
coming in barking orders.

03:50.491 --> 03:53.450
I've been just fine
riding a desk for decades.

03:53.494 --> 03:56.627
Sergeant Wade, he and I,
we had an understanding.

03:56.671 --> 03:58.673
You're one of our
most veteran officers.

03:58.716 --> 04:00.675
That's not lost on me.

04:00.718 --> 04:02.590
Here I am, driving you around?

04:02.633 --> 04:05.288
MAN :
2-9 Frank requesting a 10-85,

04:05.332 --> 04:06.463
corner of 11th and Riverside.

04:06.507 --> 04:08.813
RE: Dispute.It's probably nothing.

04:08.857 --> 04:10.380
That corner's always
got some something.

04:10.424 --> 04:11.729
2-9 Sergeant.
Show us responding.

04:11.773 --> 04:15.124
Light it up.Yes, boss.

04:22.087 --> 04:23.654
Calm down, back up.

04:23.698 --> 04:25.439
Pipe down.

04:25.482 --> 04:28.050
Hey, break it up.
What do you got?Shut your mouth!

04:28.093 --> 04:28.920
Calm down! They won't calm down!

04:28.964 --> 04:31.009
Shut your mouth!

04:31.053 --> 04:33.055
Hey, calm down, all right?That son of a bitch

04:33.098 --> 04:34.578
thinks he owns
the whole damn city.

04:34.622 --> 04:37.277
Who you calling
a son of a bitch, huh?

04:37.320 --> 04:39.191
Long. Long, grab him.

04:39.235 --> 04:40.584
Long, grab him!

04:43.631 --> 04:46.590
Hey, drop it. Drop the knife
right now, drop your knife!

04:46.634 --> 04:48.244
Drop it!

04:48.288 --> 04:49.811
Put it down!

04:49.854 --> 04:50.855
Get on the ground!

04:50.899 --> 04:54.772
Face down.
Hands behind your back.

04:55.556 --> 04:57.035
You're under arrest for menacing

04:57.079 --> 04:58.428
and criminal possession
of a weapon.

05:30.852 --> 05:33.158
Here you go.

05:33.202 --> 05:34.334
Enjoy.

05:34.943 --> 05:36.553
Can I help you?

05:43.821 --> 05:45.083
Hello.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.217
Commissioner Reagan.

05:48.260 --> 05:49.523
Menu?

05:51.002 --> 05:52.526
I know what I want.

05:52.569 --> 05:53.831
Okay.

05:53.875 --> 05:56.268
I'd like to talk to you.

05:56.312 --> 05:57.922
I'm at work.

05:57.966 --> 06:00.795
When would be a good time?

06:02.405 --> 06:04.407
That would be never.

06:07.845 --> 06:10.413
Do you want to order?

06:10.457 --> 06:13.808
Scrambled eggs, cottage fries,
well-done, white toast.

06:13.851 --> 06:15.549
Coffee?Please.

06:25.689 --> 06:27.430
How you feel?

06:27.474 --> 06:28.649
Okay.

06:28.692 --> 06:30.607
Feel good enough to answer
a few questions?

06:30.651 --> 06:32.566
Yeah.Okay.

06:32.609 --> 06:33.915
Why don't we start
with your name?

06:33.958 --> 06:34.916
Joshua Taylor.

06:34.959 --> 06:36.091
Team captain.

06:36.134 --> 06:38.441
When's the last time
you saw your teammate?

06:38.485 --> 06:40.878
Yesterday at practice.

06:40.922 --> 06:43.185
Did he seem normal to you?
Anything out of the ordinary?

06:43.228 --> 06:44.447
Everything seemed cool.

06:44.491 --> 06:46.144
I thought if he was
in trouble like this,

06:46.188 --> 06:47.407
he would have told me.

06:47.450 --> 06:49.452
Trouble like what?

06:49.496 --> 06:51.976
Whatever got him killed.

06:52.020 --> 06:54.762
You think he
got himself killed?

06:54.805 --> 06:58.548
You were friends with
Wayne Brown before college ball?Yeah.

06:58.592 --> 07:00.332
We grew up together
in the South Bronx.

07:00.376 --> 07:02.683
South Bronx,
that's a tough neighborhood.

07:02.726 --> 07:04.511
Yeah, we watched this happen
to a lot of guys.

07:04.554 --> 07:05.686
He was headed
that way himself

07:05.729 --> 07:07.949
till I brought him
onto his first team.

07:07.992 --> 07:09.733
So Wayne used
to run around in a gang.

07:09.777 --> 07:11.256
Aw, he messed around with it.

07:12.736 --> 07:14.869
I thought he was done
with that stuff.

07:14.912 --> 07:17.349
And now you think
that you might've thought wrong?

07:23.530 --> 07:24.792
Thank you.

07:24.835 --> 07:26.794
He is on his way up.

07:26.837 --> 07:28.796
Where were you, boss?Morning, Jimmy.

07:28.839 --> 07:30.885
There you are.Morning, Baker.

07:30.928 --> 07:32.669
The dream team
is waiting in your office.

07:32.713 --> 07:33.931
Join us.

07:34.976 --> 07:35.977
Morning.

07:36.020 --> 07:36.891
Good morning, boss.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.290
Where were you?

07:46.770 --> 07:48.903
Coffee, sir?

07:48.946 --> 07:50.339
Already had it

07:50.382 --> 07:52.646
at a lovely cafÃ© in Tribeca...

07:54.430 --> 07:59.435
...where Officer Rachel Witten
is a waitress.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.219
GORMLEY:
Yeah, well,

08:01.263 --> 08:02.656
that was a tough one.

08:02.699 --> 08:04.788
Glad to hear
she landed on her feet.

08:04.832 --> 08:06.616
Oh. Waitress on her feet.

08:06.660 --> 08:07.965
I get it.No.

08:08.009 --> 08:09.793
I didn't mean it...
I was just...

08:09.837 --> 08:10.707
You talk to her?

08:10.751 --> 08:12.535
I ordered breakfast from her.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.798
I mean about why she
was let go six months ago.

08:14.842 --> 08:17.148
She was let go
because I got a case

08:17.192 --> 08:19.455
of the zeitgeist.

08:20.543 --> 08:23.590
Yeah. There was a lot
of that going around.

08:23.633 --> 08:25.069
It's not a bug, Sid.

08:25.113 --> 08:27.681
It means the prevailing
climate of a time.

08:27.724 --> 08:30.510
I think I gave in
to the static.

08:30.553 --> 08:34.035
Here was a good cop
making a good stop.

08:34.078 --> 08:36.994
Stopping a man
for walking while Hispanic.

08:37.038 --> 08:40.824
Yeah, that's what the roar
of the crowd said.

08:40.868 --> 08:42.870
I want her reinstated,

08:42.913 --> 08:45.437
effective immediately.

08:45.481 --> 08:47.309
Did she ask to be?

08:47.352 --> 08:49.964
No. It was my mistake.

08:50.007 --> 08:54.055
I'm hoping she'll give me
a second chance.

08:54.098 --> 08:55.926
Well, that's easier said
than done, boss.

08:55.970 --> 08:58.363
I don't care if it's easy.

08:58.407 --> 09:00.801
I want it done.

09:00.844 --> 09:02.280
Because?

09:03.717 --> 09:06.850
Because I'm
the police commissioner.

09:09.374 --> 09:11.942
Sounds like an order, Sid.
Let's get to work.

09:11.986 --> 09:13.814
Since when are you...Shall we?

09:27.175 --> 09:29.090
Ms. Reagan, please,
can I speak to you

09:29.133 --> 09:30.657
for a minute?We're in the middle

09:30.700 --> 09:32.833
of a sentencing,
Mrs. Wright.I know, but my daughter...

09:32.876 --> 09:34.138
something is wrong with her.

09:34.182 --> 09:36.140
Yes. We're just hearing that.

09:36.184 --> 09:37.794
It's late,
I know, but...

09:37.838 --> 09:40.144
this all happened so fast,
and it's my fault
it took this long.

09:40.188 --> 09:42.886
I was so angry with her...I really do need to get

09:42.930 --> 09:44.975
to the office...I knew she was
struggling, I did,

09:45.019 --> 09:47.064
but I thought
it was growing pains.

09:47.108 --> 09:48.936
I don't know.

09:48.979 --> 09:51.068
It's hard becoming
an adult, you know?

09:51.112 --> 09:52.809
Do you have any kids?

09:52.853 --> 09:54.637
Yes, a daughter.Then you get it.

09:54.681 --> 09:56.639
I thought we could
power through it.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.859
Please.
It really is my fault.

09:58.902 --> 10:00.817
Mrs. Wright, this
is not your fault.

10:00.861 --> 10:02.863
She needed me,
and I wasn't there.

10:02.906 --> 10:05.039
So she took care
of things herself.

10:05.082 --> 10:06.954
She was trying
to self-medicate.

10:06.997 --> 10:07.955
At a party?

10:09.304 --> 10:10.914
She didn't even stay.

10:10.958 --> 10:13.047
She took the drugs
alone in her car.

10:13.090 --> 10:16.920
So why is she just
expressing this now?

10:16.964 --> 10:19.706
She's been so ashamed
she hasn't even considered

10:19.749 --> 10:21.533
that she's anything
but a guilty murderer.

10:21.577 --> 10:23.057
She is guilty.

10:23.100 --> 10:25.494
Yes, and we've never argued that

10:25.537 --> 10:28.410
and we don't plan to,

10:28.453 --> 10:31.239
but Samantha doesn't
belong in prison.

10:31.282 --> 10:34.938
Please.

10:34.982 --> 10:38.159
At least consider
the psych evaluation

10:38.202 --> 10:39.769
before you determine
her punishment.

10:43.904 --> 10:46.733
Seems a little expensive.

10:46.776 --> 10:49.039
Yeah, yeah, I'll take a look.

10:49.083 --> 10:51.912
Okay, love you, too. Bye.

10:51.955 --> 10:53.696
Your old lady?
Yup.

10:53.740 --> 10:57.091
I mean, she's not
really old...

10:57.134 --> 11:01.486
Hey, uh, thanks for
your help back there.

11:01.530 --> 11:02.966
No need.

11:03.010 --> 11:04.751
So what seems
a little expensive?

11:04.794 --> 11:05.795
Planning the wedding.

11:05.839 --> 11:07.884
Can I give you
a piece of advice?

11:07.928 --> 11:09.103
Sure.

11:09.146 --> 11:10.713
Don't blow your money
on a wedding.

11:10.757 --> 11:13.542
Buy a house, save it
for whatever,

11:13.585 --> 11:17.589
but don't drain your savings
over other people partying.

11:17.633 --> 11:19.896
You do, you'll
regret it.

11:19.940 --> 11:21.202
And do you regret it?

11:21.245 --> 11:22.986
No, because
we were smart.

11:23.030 --> 11:26.729
We had a nice brunch and
we took plenty of pictures.

11:26.773 --> 11:28.513
Sounds pretty good.

11:28.557 --> 11:31.734
It was.

11:31.778 --> 11:36.043
You know, you're not so bad
like they say you are, Sarge.

11:36.086 --> 11:39.829
Thanks... I think.

11:41.439 --> 11:43.224
Gentlemen.

11:43.267 --> 11:46.270
We done nothing wrong.I didn't even
say anything yet.

11:46.314 --> 11:47.663
Y'all never come around
here with no good news.

11:47.707 --> 11:50.274
Well, you're not under
arrest. That's good news.

11:50.318 --> 11:51.232
You know this guy?

11:51.275 --> 11:53.364
Everybody knows Wayne Brown.

11:53.408 --> 11:55.018
Facts, that's
a stupid question.

11:55.062 --> 11:56.324
You grew up with Wayne?

11:56.367 --> 11:57.891
Yeah, that's the heartbeat
of South Bronx, man.

11:57.934 --> 11:59.283
He still hangs out
with you guys?

11:59.327 --> 12:00.763
No crime in hanging out.

12:00.807 --> 12:03.113
Well, dealing's a crime.
Was he dealing for you guys?

12:05.289 --> 12:06.769
Why is that funny?

12:06.813 --> 12:08.466
Y'all don't know nothing, man.

12:08.510 --> 12:11.295
Well, why don't y'alltell us
what we don't know then.

12:11.339 --> 12:14.168
What he means to say is we
protect our own in South Bronx.

12:14.211 --> 12:15.473
We wouldn't let
a star like Brown

12:15.517 --> 12:16.997
get caught out here
in these streets.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.346
Really?

12:18.389 --> 12:19.782
I'm banking on
watching my man

12:19.826 --> 12:21.958
score triple doubles
at The Garden.

12:22.002 --> 12:24.439
Unfortunately, I don't think
that's gonna happen.

12:24.482 --> 12:27.094
Here's your bad news:
Wayne Brown is dead.

12:31.751 --> 12:32.969
LEON:
Wayne?

12:33.013 --> 12:34.797
Nah, man, he's not dead.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.103
How's that possible?
I just saw him.

12:36.146 --> 12:38.366
Have a good day.

12:47.592 --> 12:49.812
Their psychiatrist
diagnosed Samantha

12:49.856 --> 12:52.859
with anxiety, depression
and bipolar disorder.

12:52.902 --> 12:54.948
So you gonna bring in
your own psychiatrist?

12:54.991 --> 12:56.166
Get a second opinion?

12:56.210 --> 12:58.952
Their psychiatrist
is Dr. Joan Halligan.

12:58.995 --> 13:00.127
In other words...

13:00.170 --> 13:02.259
I trust her. I believe her.

13:02.303 --> 13:03.826
We're not gonna
get another result.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.697
It's just gonna
prolong the sentencing

13:05.741 --> 13:07.917
and cause more pain
for the mother of the deceased.

13:07.961 --> 13:09.919
Poor woman.

13:09.963 --> 13:12.400
The mother of the defendant's
not doing much better.

13:12.443 --> 13:13.618
She came to you?

13:13.662 --> 13:16.491
Desperate to help her daughter.

13:16.534 --> 13:19.407
Begged me to consider
a different sentence.

13:19.450 --> 13:22.236
And?This is me considering.

13:22.279 --> 13:24.151
What's there to consider?

13:24.194 --> 13:27.415
The analysis changes everything.
What we presented as a teenager

13:27.458 --> 13:29.504
on a joy ride after
a long night of partying

13:29.547 --> 13:31.201
is no longer that at all.

13:31.245 --> 13:33.073
But she was doing drugs.

13:33.116 --> 13:35.771
Yes, but they're claiming
it was more... self-medication,

13:35.815 --> 13:38.034
not recreation.
And I verified their story--

13:38.078 --> 13:40.297
Samantha went to the party,
got the drugs, left,

13:40.341 --> 13:41.646
and did them on her own.

13:41.690 --> 13:43.605
Why not just go to the doctor?

13:43.648 --> 13:44.911
Up until a few months ago,

13:44.954 --> 13:46.564
she needed a parent
for a prescription.

13:46.608 --> 13:48.784
And her parents
didn't want to help her?

13:48.828 --> 13:51.004
They didn't think it was
that severe of a problem.

13:51.047 --> 13:53.267
Yet here we are.

13:53.310 --> 13:55.051
So now what are you gonna do?

13:55.095 --> 13:59.882
Either I sentence
a struggling young woman

13:59.926 --> 14:01.492
to nearly a decade in prison,

14:01.536 --> 14:03.059
providing no help,

14:03.103 --> 14:07.759
or I get her the help she needs
and recommend probation.

14:07.803 --> 14:11.285
You can't tell that mother
that the person

14:11.328 --> 14:13.896
responsible for the death
of her son

14:13.940 --> 14:17.944
won't serve jail time.
You just can't, Erin.

14:36.179 --> 14:37.746
Have you decided?

14:37.789 --> 14:40.009
Well, I'm kind of torn between

14:40.053 --> 14:42.925
the humble pie and the crow.

14:42.969 --> 14:45.797
I'm afraid we're
out of both.

14:45.841 --> 14:48.888
I have good news.

14:48.931 --> 14:51.194
I'm offering you your job back.

14:53.414 --> 14:58.114
I made a big mistake firing you.

14:58.158 --> 14:59.942
How could you make the mistake?

14:59.986 --> 15:03.206
I reacted to the public outcry
and then...

15:03.250 --> 15:07.341
No, I meant how could it
be your mistake.

15:07.384 --> 15:10.126
I was told my termination
was required

15:10.170 --> 15:11.954
by department guidelines.

15:11.998 --> 15:16.741
Those guidelines have some
latitude for interpretation...

15:16.785 --> 15:19.962
by me.

15:20.006 --> 15:24.358
It sounds like this
is really about you,

15:24.401 --> 15:27.230
making things right for you.

15:29.189 --> 15:31.887
Look...

15:31.931 --> 15:33.280
When you arrested that man...

15:33.323 --> 15:34.846
Joseph Rivera.

15:34.890 --> 15:36.631
You knew you made a mistake.

15:36.674 --> 15:38.589
Within minutes.

15:38.633 --> 15:40.852
And you regretted that mistake?

15:40.896 --> 15:44.291
Immediately, and to this day.

15:44.334 --> 15:47.294
I made a mistake, too,

15:47.337 --> 15:50.471
and I regretted it, too.

15:50.514 --> 15:55.041
And it's taken me way too long
to make amends.

15:55.084 --> 15:59.654
I make a mistake here,

15:59.697 --> 16:01.308
coffee gets spilled,

16:01.351 --> 16:04.789
a plate gets broken.

16:04.833 --> 16:07.575
I'm real good with that.

16:14.886 --> 16:18.194
I'm thinking a spring wedding.I'm good with spring.

16:18.238 --> 16:20.414
But the weather can sometimes
be a little risky,

16:20.457 --> 16:22.024
so maybe it could be summer.

16:22.068 --> 16:25.462
Yeah, summer's good, too.

16:25.506 --> 16:27.334
Maybe winter.

16:27.377 --> 16:31.033
Could you imagine
a little snow?

16:31.077 --> 16:32.382
Snow would be pretty.

16:32.426 --> 16:34.254
Jamie.
What?

16:34.297 --> 16:36.038
You're agreeing
with everything I say.

16:36.082 --> 16:38.040
That's... bad?

16:38.084 --> 16:41.522
I just want us
to do this together,

16:41.565 --> 16:43.089
for it to be your wedding, too.

16:43.132 --> 16:47.223
There is something that
I wanted to talk about.Anything.

16:47.267 --> 16:50.139
We could spend 100 grand
on all this...

16:50.183 --> 16:52.489
I promise I'm trying
to keep it under budget.

16:52.533 --> 16:55.144
...or we could get married
at the courthouse.

16:55.188 --> 16:56.841
We could have a brunch
at my dad's.

16:56.885 --> 16:59.148
A brunch?

16:59.192 --> 17:01.107
With the money we save,
we could buy a house.

17:01.150 --> 17:04.284
Okay, what's gotten into you?
Did something happen?

17:04.327 --> 17:06.982
Nothing's gotten into me.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.028
Officer Long and I
did talk about it,

17:09.071 --> 17:11.769
but it was nothing I hadn't
already been thinking myself.

17:11.813 --> 17:14.250
But I thought that you wanted
to get married at your church?

17:14.294 --> 17:16.992
I just think
we're more practical

17:17.036 --> 17:20.126
than blowing tens of thousands
of dollars on a day.

17:20.169 --> 17:21.736
Seems like a waste.

17:21.779 --> 17:24.739
Wow.

17:26.262 --> 17:29.135
Well, thanks for finally
telling me what you think.

17:29.178 --> 17:32.181
Eddie... Hey.

17:32.225 --> 17:33.443
Eddie.

17:36.185 --> 17:38.231
I wasn't lying.
Uh-huh.

17:38.274 --> 17:39.841
I just assumed Wayne got
involved in the gang again.

17:39.884 --> 17:41.495
You just assumed?

17:41.538 --> 17:43.888
Pretty stupid for a guy from
the Bronx, don't you think,

17:43.932 --> 17:46.717
to assume?That's your tactic?

17:46.761 --> 17:48.110
Calling me stupid?

17:48.154 --> 17:50.112
It's not a tactic.

17:50.156 --> 17:52.114
Look, Brown was like
a brother to me.

17:52.158 --> 17:55.857
I did some research on you
and your "brother" Wayne Brown.

17:55.900 --> 17:59.208
I didn't realize he took your
spot in the starting rotation.

17:59.252 --> 18:00.949
So?
So...

18:00.992 --> 18:05.562
Come on. I mean,
it had to hurt a little bit.

18:05.606 --> 18:08.565
Freshman comes along,
who you bring onto the team,

18:08.609 --> 18:10.176
and he steals
the spot of a junior,

18:10.219 --> 18:12.308
and not just any
junior.

18:12.352 --> 18:15.659
A guy who's like his brother and
happens to be the team captain.

18:15.703 --> 18:19.228
It wasn't great, but what does
that have to do with anything?

18:19.272 --> 18:22.710
You brought him into basketball
and he took your spot.

18:22.753 --> 18:24.320
Maybe you want to take it back.

18:24.364 --> 18:27.193
That's crazy.

18:27.236 --> 18:30.239
You think I'm so jealous
that I'd kill him?

18:30.283 --> 18:34.243
I don't know.
Are you the jealous type?

18:34.287 --> 18:36.245
I would never
do something so petty.

18:36.289 --> 18:40.380
Maybe not, but I have seen
people murdered for a lot less.

18:40.423 --> 18:42.469
You want to make assumptions
about me, go right ahead.

18:42.512 --> 18:43.905
The rest of
the world does.

18:43.948 --> 18:45.515
But I've never even
seen the inside

18:45.559 --> 18:47.648
of a police station until today.
Go ahead and research that.

18:47.691 --> 18:49.345
Already did.

18:49.389 --> 18:51.130
S-So you know I have no record.

18:51.173 --> 18:53.915
I know you have no record yet.

18:56.961 --> 18:58.963
Detective.

18:59.007 --> 19:01.140
What the hell are you
doing here, Walsh?

19:01.183 --> 19:02.402
I'm-I'm tracking
the case.

19:02.445 --> 19:04.317
It's not your
case to track.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.362
You really think Taylor
killed his teammate?

19:06.406 --> 19:08.364
That-That's insane.
The kid has great character.

19:08.408 --> 19:10.714
I didn't say I think anything,
and why don't you leave

19:10.758 --> 19:12.325
the thinking to
the detectives, okay?

19:12.368 --> 19:15.284
There's no way anyone knows this
team like I do. I-I can help.

19:15.328 --> 19:17.025
I didn't ask
for your help.

19:17.068 --> 19:18.592
Taylor's decline
came out of nowhere.

19:18.635 --> 19:20.289
He was the star player.Hey!

19:20.333 --> 19:22.639
Do your own job. Okay?

19:29.255 --> 19:31.213
Thanks for coming in, Maureen.

19:31.257 --> 19:33.215
Of course.Have a seat.

19:33.259 --> 19:36.349
I, um, I never got to thank you,
Ms. Reagan. It has meant

19:36.392 --> 19:38.002
the world to me
how patient and kind

19:38.046 --> 19:39.700
everybody at the
D.A.'s office has been.

19:39.743 --> 19:41.310
Just doing our job.

19:41.354 --> 19:43.312
So what's going on?

19:43.356 --> 19:47.925
The counsel for the defendant
has brought in new information.

19:47.969 --> 19:49.840
It seems a little late.I know.

19:49.884 --> 19:53.366
I thought the same thing,
but the defense is claiming

19:53.409 --> 19:55.716
that they weren't aware
of the information until now.

19:55.759 --> 19:57.239
Do you believe them?

19:57.283 --> 19:59.676
I believe the information.

19:59.720 --> 20:02.375
What kind of information?A psychiatrist

20:02.418 --> 20:05.073
has diagnosed Samantha
with anxiety,

20:05.116 --> 20:06.857
depression
and bipolar disorder.

20:06.901 --> 20:09.338
Okay, and what does that mean?

20:09.382 --> 20:13.777
It begs the question if
the drugs found in her system

20:13.821 --> 20:16.737
after the accident were used
to self-medicate.

20:16.780 --> 20:18.956
Oh, please.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.263
Which changes her mental state.

20:21.307 --> 20:22.699
Well, it's still murder.

20:22.743 --> 20:25.528
Technically, it's manslaughter.Well, it's murder to me,

20:25.572 --> 20:27.791
and it should absolutely
be treated as such,

20:27.835 --> 20:32.143
regardless of mental state
or some psycho analysis.

20:32.187 --> 20:33.710
I understand.

20:33.754 --> 20:35.364
You're still gonna
hold her responsible, right?

20:35.408 --> 20:37.845
She's still pleading guilty.

20:37.888 --> 20:39.586
Okay, good.

20:39.629 --> 20:40.848
But the sentence

20:40.891 --> 20:42.545
may be lighter.

20:42.589 --> 20:45.113
As light as probation.

20:45.156 --> 20:46.941
So no jail time?

20:46.984 --> 20:48.986
That's correct.

20:50.597 --> 20:53.208
Surely someone can't commit
such a heinous crime

20:53.252 --> 20:55.471
and serve no jail time.

20:55.515 --> 20:58.039
I'm afraid you can.

20:58.082 --> 21:00.737
I'm glad to have you on my team.

21:00.781 --> 21:03.479
I'm not on a team, Maureen.

21:03.523 --> 21:06.090
I represent the people
of the state of New York,

21:06.134 --> 21:08.745
including Samantha Wright.

21:10.704 --> 21:12.967
Well, I...

21:13.010 --> 21:15.622
trust that you'll represent the
person who has lost the most.

21:17.972 --> 21:21.367
And what more is there to lose
than your life?

21:40.386 --> 21:42.823
Anybody?

21:42.866 --> 21:44.564
Come on, nobody at this table

21:44.607 --> 21:45.739
made a New Year's resolution?

21:45.782 --> 21:47.001
I don't believe in 'em.

21:47.044 --> 21:48.829
It's not something
you have to believe in, Pop.

21:48.872 --> 21:50.483
Yeah, it's more like a target
you set for yourself, Pop.

21:50.526 --> 21:52.354
I always give up
something for Lent.

21:52.398 --> 21:53.790
But that's not the same thing.

21:53.834 --> 21:55.401
Look, if I'm going
to deprive myself,

21:55.444 --> 21:56.880
I would like it
at least to be

21:56.924 --> 21:58.447
something Our Lord
would appreciate.

21:58.491 --> 21:59.840
DANNY: Well, that's right,
'cause God puts a little note

21:59.883 --> 22:01.668
in your file, like,

22:01.711 --> 22:05.236
"He gave up bacon for 40
days once. Let him in."

22:05.280 --> 22:06.890
That's the beauty
of the afterlife.Oh...

22:06.934 --> 22:08.370
You can make it
whatever you want,

22:08.414 --> 22:10.416
'cause there's no one
to prove otherwise.
Uh-huh.

22:10.459 --> 22:11.939
And when did you
ever give up bacon?

22:11.982 --> 22:13.897
I didn't say that, Danny did.

22:13.941 --> 22:15.769
'Cause you always seem
to give up

22:15.812 --> 22:18.728
something extremely specific.

22:18.772 --> 22:20.730
Mallomars, but not all cookies.

22:20.774 --> 22:22.645
Bourbon whiskey,
but not all booze.

22:22.689 --> 22:23.864
Busted!

22:23.907 --> 22:25.431
I make hard choices.

22:25.474 --> 22:26.867
Oh. Please.

22:26.910 --> 22:28.347
Maybe not hard enough
for you, but...

22:28.390 --> 22:29.478
I made a resolution.

22:30.479 --> 22:32.133
To try to contribute
to these dinners

22:32.176 --> 22:33.743
in a way that keeps them
from turning into

22:33.787 --> 22:35.266
some cable news talk show.

22:36.529 --> 22:38.008
What is that
supposed to mean?

22:38.052 --> 22:40.837
You know, everybody trying
to make the other guy wrong.

22:40.881 --> 22:42.839
Huh.

22:42.883 --> 22:43.753
Is that what you think
we do here?

22:43.797 --> 22:45.407
That is the general mojo,

22:45.451 --> 22:46.669
if you boil it down.

22:47.757 --> 22:49.455
JAMIE:
Not at all.

22:49.498 --> 22:51.195
It's a free and open exchange
of different opinions.

22:51.239 --> 22:52.806
Yeah.So I'm wrong?

22:52.849 --> 22:55.722
Well, yeah.

22:55.765 --> 22:57.985
You are.
JANKO:
Well, see?

22:58.028 --> 22:59.769
My point exactly.
DANNY:
Well, look at that.

22:59.813 --> 23:01.554
Only 30 days into
the New Year

23:01.597 --> 23:04.165
and already your
resolution is gone. Poof.

23:04.208 --> 23:05.949
Talk about an epic fail.

23:05.993 --> 23:08.125
Actually,
I made two resolutions.

23:08.169 --> 23:09.910
The first one is
to always be right.

23:09.953 --> 23:11.564
Wow.

23:11.607 --> 23:13.914
And the second one is to admit,

23:13.957 --> 23:15.742
quickly and completely,

23:15.785 --> 23:18.701
when I'm wrong.

23:21.487 --> 23:22.923
I like him.

23:22.966 --> 23:24.577
I hope you turn
out like him.

23:31.932 --> 23:33.629
Take a look.Finance section?

23:33.673 --> 23:35.849
No, not the section.
The headline.

23:35.892 --> 23:37.938
Didn't occur to me--
you know, sports gambling

23:37.981 --> 23:39.853
was legalized in five states,
including New Jersey

23:39.896 --> 23:41.985
and all the casinos
in New York State.

23:42.029 --> 23:43.465
But how is that relevant?

23:43.509 --> 23:45.075
Well, Joshua Taylor
got benched when?

23:45.119 --> 23:47.643
After he blew
the biggest game of the year.

23:47.687 --> 23:49.340
But a whole team loses a game,

23:49.384 --> 23:51.342
not just one player.But only one player

23:51.386 --> 23:54.563
averages 32 points a game and is
the star player on the team,

23:54.607 --> 23:56.304
but for some unknown reason,

23:56.347 --> 23:58.698
on that particular night,
couldn't hit a single shot

23:58.741 --> 24:01.831
and didn't score a single point:
Joshua Taylor.

24:01.875 --> 24:03.964
A lot of people bet
on that game?

24:04.007 --> 24:05.008
Biggest rake of the year.

24:05.052 --> 24:07.184
Losing everyone a lot of money.Yes.

24:07.228 --> 24:10.013
And when the people lose big,
the bookies win big.

24:10.057 --> 24:13.016
You think Taylor was bribed
by some bookie to lose?

24:13.060 --> 24:14.888
I thought point-shaving was
a thing of the past,

24:14.931 --> 24:15.932
but maybe I was wrong.

24:15.976 --> 24:17.543
It just seems like
a desperate act

24:17.586 --> 24:19.762
for some two-bit bookie.Okay, well,
look at California.

24:19.806 --> 24:22.852
They legalize pot--
who gets hurt the most?

24:22.896 --> 24:24.201
Small-time drug dealers.That's right.

24:24.245 --> 24:25.855
It's like New York
and gambling.

24:25.899 --> 24:29.076
They legalize the gambling,
the small-time bookie gets hurt.

24:29.119 --> 24:30.512
If I know one thing

24:30.556 --> 24:32.906
about bookies, they
never go down without a fight.

24:32.949 --> 24:34.777
Let's take a ride.

24:40.043 --> 24:41.567
SCOTT:
I mean...

24:41.610 --> 24:43.177
we all make mistakes.

24:43.220 --> 24:46.397
I've made
some... doozies

24:46.441 --> 24:47.660
when I was a cop.

24:47.703 --> 24:50.576
Yeah, I got slapped down,
got rips,

24:50.619 --> 24:52.795
got suspended.

24:52.839 --> 24:57.060
I tried all that on her,
but at the end of the day,

24:57.104 --> 24:59.976
this was way more
than a rip.

25:00.020 --> 25:02.109
She got painted as a pariah

25:02.152 --> 25:05.025
and got fired for the
icing on the cake.

25:07.810 --> 25:09.333
Can I be honest with you?

25:09.377 --> 25:11.597
Probably the only way
to really help me.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.816
Daughters don't talk to their
dads the way they do their moms,

25:13.860 --> 25:15.339
you know?I do know.

25:15.383 --> 25:18.081
You develop your own
tracking system for them.

25:19.605 --> 25:24.174
So, uh, believe me
when I say that, uh...

25:24.218 --> 25:27.090
she was just shattered
when you let her go.

25:30.485 --> 25:32.052
Pride, confidence,

25:32.095 --> 25:34.445
sense of a place in the world,

25:34.489 --> 25:36.491
boom.

25:39.712 --> 25:42.889
Couple of years ago, I
would have just given her a rip

25:42.932 --> 25:45.892
and helped her become
a better cop.

25:45.935 --> 25:48.024
I'm sorry, Scott.

25:48.068 --> 25:50.157
I appreciate that.

25:50.200 --> 25:52.028
But I honestly don't
think that's enough

25:52.072 --> 25:54.814
to get her back up on
this particular horse,

25:54.857 --> 25:56.946
you being sorry.

25:56.990 --> 25:58.992
'Course not.

26:01.647 --> 26:04.519
You know she's taking classes
at John Jay.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.087
Once a detective...

26:07.130 --> 26:09.176
Where does she hope
to get with that?

26:09.219 --> 26:11.395
I think she's...
she's treading water.

26:11.439 --> 26:12.832
How so?

26:12.875 --> 26:16.836
She's aiming for a job
in law enforcement that, uh...

26:16.879 --> 26:20.187
doesn't exist,
and it never will.

26:20.970 --> 26:23.277
The one without risk.

26:30.632 --> 26:31.981
It's not like we
don't have the money,

26:32.025 --> 26:33.374
but we could afford
to buy a house

26:33.417 --> 26:34.897
with a yard
for our kids someday.

26:34.941 --> 26:38.031
You know, they'll cost you
a hundred grand a year, each.

26:38.074 --> 26:40.947
Yeah, I heard. But,
uh, what else are you
gonna spend your money on

26:40.990 --> 26:42.513
except taking care of
your family, right?

26:42.557 --> 26:44.385
: Oh, I could
think of a million things.

26:44.428 --> 26:46.996
A boat, for one.Oh, you own a house
by the water?

26:47.040 --> 26:49.346
No. We live
in a house in Queens.

26:49.390 --> 26:50.826
My mother's house.

26:50.870 --> 26:53.481
Oh, that's nice-- she
passed it down to you?

26:53.524 --> 26:55.701
Not exactly.
She still lives in it.

26:56.745 --> 26:58.834
Oh.But...

26:58.878 --> 27:01.532
when I retire,
at 55 and not a day more,

27:01.576 --> 27:03.534
I'm gonna be set for life.

27:03.578 --> 27:05.449
Got big plans?
Gonna travel somewhere?

27:05.493 --> 27:07.190
Oh, yeah, to and from my couch.
It'll be great.

27:07.234 --> 27:09.323
MAN :
2-9 Frank, you have a 10-34,

27:09.366 --> 27:11.412
corner of 11th and Riverside.

27:11.455 --> 27:13.109
Ah, these schmucks again.

27:13.153 --> 27:15.372
Caller states male stabbed
at the location.

27:15.416 --> 27:17.113
That crazy
son of a bitch got him.

27:17.157 --> 27:18.767
All right, let's
head over. Come on.We're ten blocks out.

27:18.811 --> 27:20.421
Somebody else'll grab it.

27:20.464 --> 27:22.553
2-9 Sergeant responding.
Let's move.

27:26.383 --> 27:28.647
Police. Step aside.

27:28.690 --> 27:31.258
Please, sir, move.
Excuse me. Step aside.

27:31.301 --> 27:32.912
What happened?
Somebody stab you?

27:34.217 --> 27:36.045
All right, hey,
help is on the way, okay?

27:36.089 --> 27:37.568
Stay back. Stay back.How far out is that bus?

27:37.612 --> 27:39.396
15 minutes.15 minutes.

27:39.440 --> 27:42.878
Hey. Stay with me, sir,
stay with me.

27:42.922 --> 27:44.488
Come on, help me
get him in the RMP.

27:44.532 --> 27:46.229
What?I said help me get him

27:46.273 --> 27:48.362
in the RMP.That's too risky.

27:48.405 --> 27:49.842
Hospital's, like,
two blocks from here.

27:49.885 --> 27:52.018
If he goes out of the picture
en route to the hospital,

27:52.061 --> 27:53.497
we open ourselves up
to a lawsuit.

27:53.541 --> 27:55.586
We got to wait
for that bus.If we wait for that bus,

27:55.630 --> 27:57.414
he's gonna bleed out
long before they get here.

27:57.458 --> 27:59.721
We got to take him
ourselves. Come on.No.

27:59.765 --> 28:01.810
Hey. I'm the boss, and I'm
giving you a direct order.

28:01.854 --> 28:03.420
Help me get him in the RMP!

28:07.294 --> 28:08.512
Up...

28:12.647 --> 28:13.996
Watch the door.

28:14.040 --> 28:15.041
Okay, push.

28:15.084 --> 28:17.130
Stay with me, buddy,
stay with me.

28:17.173 --> 28:19.132
Let's go.I'm not getting in.
It's too risky.

28:19.175 --> 28:21.221
Get in the car
and put pressure on his wound!

28:33.929 --> 28:36.410
DANNY: Your shot looks
pretty damn good to me.

28:36.453 --> 28:38.455
What are you doing here?

28:38.499 --> 28:40.414
You weren't jealous
of Wayne Brown

28:40.457 --> 28:42.459
being a better
player than you.

28:42.503 --> 28:44.157
You couldn't be.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.594
'Cause he wasn't a better
player than you, not really.

28:46.637 --> 28:48.988
What are you talking about?You know, a whole
lot of people

28:49.031 --> 28:51.947
lost a lot of money when you
guys started losing games.

28:51.991 --> 28:54.167
That's what this is about?

28:54.210 --> 28:55.777
You know something
about that?

28:55.821 --> 28:58.301
Just because I played a bad game
doesn't make me a criminal.

28:58.345 --> 29:00.521
It makes you a criminal
if you throw games for profit.

29:00.564 --> 29:01.652
I didn't.Let me

29:01.696 --> 29:03.045
put it to you like this:
conspiracy is

29:03.089 --> 29:05.395
a hell of a lot less
of a crime than murder.

29:05.439 --> 29:07.006
But you help us

29:07.049 --> 29:09.530
with that murder, then it
becomes even less of a crime.

29:09.573 --> 29:12.489
You get what I'm saying?
So why don't you knock it off
and start telling the truth.

29:12.533 --> 29:14.665
You don't understand.

29:14.709 --> 29:16.319
This school makes
a fortune off us,

29:16.363 --> 29:18.278
and now these
gambling junkies will, too.

29:18.321 --> 29:20.280
And my family's living
in poverty.

29:20.323 --> 29:22.717
How is that right?So you're admitting

29:22.761 --> 29:24.414
that you threw games for profit?

29:24.458 --> 29:25.807
But I didn't kill Wayne!Are you saying

29:25.851 --> 29:27.504
Wayne Brown wouldn't cooperate?

29:27.548 --> 29:29.158
He was unmovable.

29:29.202 --> 29:30.943
I tried to tell him that money
was rightfully ours.

29:30.986 --> 29:32.858
Yeah, and then you went
and told your bookie

29:32.901 --> 29:35.469
that Wayne wouldn't play dirty,
and look what happened.I didn't have to.

29:35.512 --> 29:37.297
Robbie was hounding Wayne
day in and day out

29:37.340 --> 29:38.428
trying to get him on board.

29:38.472 --> 29:39.995
Can you lead us to this Robbie?

29:40.039 --> 29:41.605
Please.
This would ruin my career

29:41.649 --> 29:43.477
and any shot I got of going pro.Well, you got

29:43.520 --> 29:46.959
a damn good shot of going
to prison if you don't help us.

29:49.613 --> 29:52.878
At least you will have done
the right thing.

30:09.024 --> 30:11.592
WOMAN: Although my
client, Ms. Wright,

30:11.635 --> 30:12.854
is accepting
responsibility,

30:12.898 --> 30:14.987
we ask the court impose
a minimum sentence

30:15.030 --> 30:17.163
in light of her
psychiatric evaluation.

30:17.206 --> 30:18.599
JUDGE:
And, A.D.A. Reagan?

30:18.642 --> 30:20.601
We believe
Ms. Wright's mental state

30:20.644 --> 30:22.908
played a role in her actions
in this case.

30:22.951 --> 30:25.606
It's only fair they play
a role in the sentencing.

30:25.649 --> 30:27.042
And your recommendation?

30:28.087 --> 30:30.524
We would like to recommend...

30:30.567 --> 30:33.614
the minimum sentence
of probation with the condition

30:33.657 --> 30:36.269
that the defendant participates
in a treatment program

30:36.312 --> 30:38.619
ordered by the court.What? Was anybody
listening to me?

30:38.662 --> 30:40.055
Order in the court.

30:40.099 --> 30:42.144
We appreciate your statement
to the court, Mrs. Lee,

30:42.188 --> 30:43.972
and we're sorry for what
you've been through.

30:44.016 --> 30:45.582
I'm going along
with the recommendation

30:45.626 --> 30:46.670
of the prosecutor.

30:46.714 --> 30:48.716
I'm imposing
a sentence of probation,

30:48.759 --> 30:49.848
with the successful completion

30:49.891 --> 30:51.458
of a treatment program.No...

30:51.501 --> 30:53.503
How could you do this to me?
To Jackson?

30:53.547 --> 30:56.419
It's not meant to hurt you.You said that you would ask
for a maximum sentence.

30:56.463 --> 30:58.160
That was before
the new evidence came in.

30:58.204 --> 31:00.467
My son is in the ground
because of her.

31:00.510 --> 31:02.034
What more evidence do you need?

31:02.077 --> 31:03.774
Order in the court.

31:03.818 --> 31:05.385
She killed my baby.

31:05.428 --> 31:07.691
GUARD:
Move, move, move.

31:07.735 --> 31:09.302
She killed my son, Ms. Reagan!

31:09.345 --> 31:11.347
She killed my baby...

31:24.317 --> 31:26.275
Hello?

31:26.319 --> 31:28.016
Maybe no one's home.

31:28.060 --> 31:30.279
Police! Hello?ROBBIE:
Back here! Hurry!

31:30.323 --> 31:34.196
WALSH:
Shut up. Shut up!

31:34.240 --> 31:35.545
Shut up!

31:35.589 --> 31:36.720
ROBBIE: I don't know
what you're talking about.

31:36.764 --> 31:37.765
WALSH:
Shut your mouth.

31:37.808 --> 31:39.593
ROBBIE:
You're not straight.

31:39.636 --> 31:41.943
WALSH: Shut your mouth!You're not straight.

31:43.684 --> 31:45.555
Shut up.

31:45.599 --> 31:47.601
What the hell
are you doing here, Walsh?

31:47.644 --> 31:50.952
Think this son of a bitch
stole my money.

31:50.996 --> 31:52.693
Hey. Put the gun down.

31:52.736 --> 31:54.738
Are you guys gonna do something
with this maniac...Shut up.

31:54.782 --> 31:57.611
This guy ruined the game!

31:57.654 --> 32:01.223
I knew that team
like the back of my hand.

32:01.267 --> 32:03.747
I'm right, aren't I?
That's-that's why you're here.

32:03.791 --> 32:05.140
Look, I'm not gonna talk
to you with...This guy

32:05.184 --> 32:07.838
stole every dime I have.Put the gun down and relax.

32:07.882 --> 32:10.189
He ruined my favorite team.

32:10.232 --> 32:11.625
Do this, he's gonna
take more from you

32:11.668 --> 32:12.800
then he's already taken.

32:12.843 --> 32:15.846
She's right. Hey.

32:15.890 --> 32:16.935
Listen to her,
all right?

32:16.978 --> 32:20.547
You know how
this goes, Walsh.

32:20.590 --> 32:22.288
You leave here in cuffs
or a body bag,

32:22.331 --> 32:24.072
you don't put that gun down.
All right?

32:24.116 --> 32:25.987
Take it easy.

32:26.031 --> 32:28.859
You know the drill, Walsh.
Come on. Nice and easy.

32:28.903 --> 32:31.906
Come on. There you go.
There you go.

32:37.694 --> 32:40.001
Got him?
Yeah.

32:40.045 --> 32:42.656
How about you, you okay?I'm all right.

32:42.699 --> 32:44.397
Good, 'cause you're
under arrest, too.

32:44.440 --> 32:45.615
On what basis?

32:45.659 --> 32:46.921
Conspiracy.

32:46.965 --> 32:49.054
That's ridiculous.
Everything's legal here.

32:49.097 --> 32:50.707
It's not legal to have kids
shave points

32:50.751 --> 32:51.839
on basketball games

32:51.882 --> 32:53.580
and then murder
the holdout.

32:53.623 --> 32:56.017
Come on, let's go.

33:02.328 --> 33:05.026
Oh, great.

33:05.070 --> 33:06.419
Come on.

33:06.462 --> 33:08.203
At least let me
buy you a drink.

33:08.247 --> 33:10.423
I'm meeting my dad,
so that seat's taken.

33:10.466 --> 33:14.035
He said you'd understand.

33:20.302 --> 33:21.477
BARTENDER:
Can I get you?

33:21.521 --> 33:24.611
Irish neat, glass of
ice, and back her up.

33:24.654 --> 33:29.964
With your most expensive red,
please, Mike.

33:30.008 --> 33:33.098
Look, you have my word,
this is the last time

33:33.141 --> 33:34.969
I'll come looking
for you. This is it.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.014
Good to hear.

33:36.057 --> 33:39.930
This is me trying
to make amends,

33:39.974 --> 33:44.326
trying to redeem myself in
your eyes but-but most of all,

33:44.370 --> 33:48.287
it's me trying to get
a good cop back on the job.

33:48.330 --> 33:51.290
Stop beating yourself up.
I have.

33:51.333 --> 33:54.336
I will try,
the moment I leave here,

33:54.380 --> 33:58.340
because I will have done
everything I could.

33:58.384 --> 34:01.691
The question is, will you have?

34:05.043 --> 34:08.350
Thanks.

34:08.394 --> 34:10.483
Who's asking that question?

34:10.526 --> 34:12.746
Not me.

34:12.789 --> 34:16.315
Maybe you are,
back of your head.

34:16.358 --> 34:20.536
"If I get knocked down,
can I get back up?"

34:20.580 --> 34:22.625
"If I make a mistake,
can I learn from it,

34:22.669 --> 34:25.933
or do I just run away?"

34:25.976 --> 34:28.805
"You fall off a horse, you got
to get right back on it"?

34:28.849 --> 34:30.198
That's what you're bringing?

34:30.242 --> 34:31.982
You didn't just fall off.

34:32.026 --> 34:35.290
That horse stomped on you
and bit you in the ass.

34:37.075 --> 34:40.121
And yeah, there's always risk.

34:40.165 --> 34:42.123
Sometimes to yourself,
sometimes to others.

34:42.167 --> 34:46.345
But that risk is the price
you pay for opportunity.

34:46.388 --> 34:50.871
I mean, in things worth doing.

34:50.914 --> 34:53.134
No offense to waitressing.

34:53.178 --> 34:55.571
None taken.

34:55.615 --> 35:00.924
I can promise you one thing,
something that only a handful

35:00.968 --> 35:06.147
of the 35,000 men and women
in the NYPD have.

35:09.194 --> 35:12.936
That this PC would personally
have your back,

35:12.980 --> 35:17.680
because this PC would owe you,

35:17.724 --> 35:21.684
personally.

35:21.728 --> 35:24.122
Big-time.

35:39.833 --> 35:42.401
Thanks for having
dinner with me.

35:42.444 --> 35:46.100
You saved that man's life.
Least you deserve is dinner.

35:46.144 --> 35:49.103
Officer Long is facing
departmental charges.

35:49.147 --> 35:51.105
Who cares about Long?

35:51.149 --> 35:54.152
You made the right call.

35:57.024 --> 35:59.331
This is where
we're having dinner?

36:02.160 --> 36:04.597
Does anyone even work here?

36:08.340 --> 36:10.168
You know what I love about you?

36:12.126 --> 36:15.477
You're unafraid.

36:15.521 --> 36:19.089
You take risks, and you lead
with your whole heart.

36:19.133 --> 36:22.919
And you challenge me
to do the same.

36:22.963 --> 36:25.095
I don't think I ever would have
taken that sergeant's exam

36:25.139 --> 36:27.185
if it wasn't for you.

36:27.228 --> 36:30.188
I can't take credit for that.

36:33.234 --> 36:36.542
You make me better.

36:36.585 --> 36:39.197
You make me take risks.

36:39.240 --> 36:43.853
To not always take
the safest road.

36:43.897 --> 36:46.247
Is this your way of saying
you're sorry?

36:46.291 --> 36:48.641
I am sorry.

36:48.684 --> 36:52.253
For the way I went about it and
for not coming to you sooner.

36:52.297 --> 36:55.691
Thank you.

36:55.735 --> 36:59.260
But I'm always gonna be the guy
that's worried about our bills,

36:59.304 --> 37:03.699
and how to take care of our
family ten years from now.

37:03.743 --> 37:05.614
Part of that's just who I am.

37:05.658 --> 37:07.355
I know.

37:08.922 --> 37:11.925
Can you live with that?

37:13.666 --> 37:16.277
If I have to.

37:17.670 --> 37:19.672
Good.

37:24.067 --> 37:27.462
Um, so...

37:27.506 --> 37:29.769
this place is...?

37:29.812 --> 37:33.120
A compromise.

37:41.824 --> 37:44.436
It's perfect.

37:59.973 --> 38:01.235
I'm sorry, Mrs. Wright.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.585
I don't think that Maureen Lee
will be coming.

38:03.629 --> 38:06.327
Okay, I understand.

38:06.371 --> 38:08.982
I thought... I don't know,

38:09.025 --> 38:11.158
I thought she would be
willing to speak with you.

38:11.201 --> 38:13.769
Maybe someday she will.

38:13.813 --> 38:14.857
Erin.

38:19.209 --> 38:21.951
ERIN: Maureen.Your daughter took everything
away from us.

38:21.995 --> 38:23.388
Jackson's chance
to ever grow up.

38:23.431 --> 38:24.867
He'll never
even drive a car,

38:24.911 --> 38:26.434
or go to college.

38:26.478 --> 38:29.611
God, he'll never even go
to first grade, and for what?

38:29.655 --> 38:31.744
A good time? What a waste.

38:33.180 --> 38:35.269
How can you even live
with yourself?

38:35.313 --> 38:36.618
I can't.

38:38.272 --> 38:40.927
I would give any limb on my body
to take it all back.

38:40.970 --> 38:43.451
To bring him back.So completely selfish.

38:43.495 --> 38:47.325
Please, if you need
to blame someone, blame me.

38:47.368 --> 38:50.284
I made some terrible mistakes
as a parent.

38:50.328 --> 38:53.766
I thought she was just a mess,
just a little lost.

38:53.809 --> 38:56.769
I didn't see what was really
going on. That's on me.

38:58.684 --> 39:01.817
I'm so, so sorry.

39:03.819 --> 39:07.040
I shouldn't have let him
play so close to the street.No...

39:07.083 --> 39:08.563
No, God...

39:08.607 --> 39:10.696
N-No, none of this is on you.

39:10.739 --> 39:13.916
I turned around,
I was distracted.

39:13.960 --> 39:16.397
No, she's right, don't think
that way for even a second.

39:18.225 --> 39:21.315
I will be sorry to my grave.

39:23.273 --> 39:26.233
Me, too.

39:29.279 --> 39:31.673
I, um...

39:35.416 --> 39:37.592
I accept your apology.

39:39.028 --> 39:40.639
That doesn't mean
that I forgive your daughter

39:40.682 --> 39:45.383
or that anything about this
is even close to okay,

39:45.426 --> 39:48.995
but I do accept your apology.

40:07.709 --> 40:09.711
Officer Witten?

40:17.937 --> 40:19.286
Commissioner.

40:19.329 --> 40:23.029
How are you liking the 2-9?

40:23.072 --> 40:25.597
Just fine, sir, thank you.

40:25.640 --> 40:29.601
Sergeant Reagan's been
especially supportive.

40:31.037 --> 40:33.779
Go figure.

40:33.822 --> 40:37.043
Good to see you back in uniform.

40:37.086 --> 40:39.088
You wear it well.

40:41.134 --> 40:43.484
Thank you, sir.

40:43.528 --> 40:45.834
Proud to wear it.

40:47.923 --> 40:50.491
Watch your six.

40:50.535 --> 40:52.493
Yes, sir.
