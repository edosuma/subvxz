00:01.096 --> 00:02.377
<i>Things were the same around here.</i>

00:02.512 --> 00:04.208
<i>Dr. Kelso was retired.</i>

00:04.727 --> 00:05.566
No.

00:05.601 --> 00:08.003
<i>But he had also won
free muffins for life</i>

00:08.004 --> 00:10.378
<i>so he still came
to the hospital every day.</i>

00:10.667 --> 00:13.491
- Good morning, people!
- Hi, Bob!

00:14.081 --> 00:15.423
Hey, Anderson.

00:15.424 --> 00:18.231
Before I retired, we never got
to have our heart-to-heart.

00:18.729 --> 00:20.996
I'm not really
a touchy-feely type but...

00:21.624 --> 00:24.793
Well, hell, I'll just say it.
You're a jackass.

00:27.009 --> 00:29.475
<i>As usual, Turk and I
were working our asses off.</i>

00:29.576 --> 00:32.714
Oh, man. You and Izzy are here.
Come on, to watch...

00:33.137 --> 00:35.025
Oh, nice, it's already on.

00:35.026 --> 00:36.026
<i>...Sesame Street!</i>

00:36.027 --> 00:39.076
It's a good one.
The letter is J.

00:39.723 --> 00:42.755
<i>And Dr. Cox was once again
torturing the new interns.</i>

00:42.790 --> 00:46.179
Before we start rounds today,
who watches <i>Deal Or No Deal</i> ?

00:47.237 --> 00:48.293
Get out!

00:49.121 --> 00:51.177
And you. Legally Blonde.

00:51.825 --> 00:54.819
Name the three possible causes
of this patient's hematemesis.

00:55.423 --> 00:59.303
Peptic ulcer disease,
oesophageal varices, or...

00:59.779 --> 01:01.539
Zollinger Ellison syndrom?

01:01.985 --> 01:04.650
- That's actually correct.
- Yes!

01:04.686 --> 01:07.170
And if you're wondering
why I say "actually".

01:07.205 --> 01:10.225
You've proven to be such
a vapid helpless incompetent,

01:10.226 --> 01:14.357
that for you to say something correct
is a wild departure from the norm,

01:14.358 --> 01:16.979
therefore I decided
I had better pick a word

01:17.080 --> 01:20.299
that drew attention to the fact that
it was such an extraordinary occurence,

01:20.300 --> 01:22.323
and I--
I went ahead and chose "actually".

01:22.324 --> 01:24.419
- Zwah!
- Who made that noise?

01:25.125 --> 01:28.000
Oh. I did. I'm a little tired
of her chiper attitude.

01:28.038 --> 01:29.739
So it was cool to see you just slam her.

01:29.740 --> 01:31.259
So I just went "Zwah!".

01:31.460 --> 01:34.277
So, if I were to ask
you a question like...

01:34.278 --> 01:37.800
"What is the next diagnostic move
in checking for Zollinger Ellison?"

01:37.844 --> 01:40.393
and you didn't know,
I would say "Zwah!".

01:40.694 --> 01:44.281
Nope. Cause I know the answer.
Oesephago-gastro-duodenoscopy.

01:44.482 --> 01:45.499
Zwah!

01:46.195 --> 01:49.469
Good, but mark my words.
I will zwah you by the end of the day.

01:49.470 --> 01:51.505
Now, since the rest
of your brains are so tiny,

01:51.550 --> 01:53.457
from now on,
I will speak like a caveman.

01:53.658 --> 01:57.169
You, bad doctors. Me, good doctor.
You, follow.

01:59.627 --> 02:00.923
Hey, did you guys heard
they're starting to interview

02:00.958 --> 02:02.051
for the new Chief of Medicine?

02:02.102 --> 02:03.887
Actually, they already found someone.

02:04.735 --> 02:08.631
That's right, knuckleheads.
There's a new chief in town!

02:09.761 --> 02:11.382
That was a mistake.

02:11.417 --> 02:13.935
I'll be watching you, John Dorian.

02:13.936 --> 02:18.951
And guess what.
My eyes never close.

02:20.198 --> 02:21.336
Mine neither.

02:23.318 --> 02:24.837
Actually, they do. That was a lie.

02:26.713 --> 02:28.169
I grew up on the street.

02:28.555 --> 02:31.065
No, not the hood.
The Sesame Street.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:47.267 --> 02:50.176
Patient. Iron high.
Heart swollen big.

02:50.212 --> 02:51.990
You. What make sick?

02:52.291 --> 02:54.377
Hum, could it be hemochromatosis?

02:54.478 --> 02:56.271
Correct. Rounds. Over.

02:56.819 --> 02:58.187
You. Go.

02:58.607 --> 03:00.173
Thoughts on the beard?

03:00.611 --> 03:02.196
- I like it.
- Thank you, Perry.

03:02.197 --> 03:03.948
Course, I'm totally in favor of

03:03.994 --> 03:07.267
anything that covers up parts of your
face that were previously uncovered.

03:07.348 --> 03:09.259
Yay! You hurt my feelings!

03:09.260 --> 03:11.341
So? Which intern are
each of you guys gonna choose

03:11.342 --> 03:13.907
this year to be your
personnal protégé/lackey?

03:14.699 --> 03:17.091
I'm going with Katie,
because she's not a jerk anymore.

03:17.655 --> 03:18.927
Plus, we got the same hair.

03:19.327 --> 03:22.111
At first, I thought I was going
to mentor both Neil and Garett,

03:22.152 --> 03:24.225
because they always
ask me to go roller blading.

03:24.226 --> 03:25.757
Let it go, we don't have the time.

03:25.758 --> 03:27.763
And then I thought,
why not pick a woman?

03:27.764 --> 03:29.967
How about a little
feminine energy in my life?

03:30.469 --> 03:34.133
You mean like the kind of energy that
seeps out of every pore in your body?

03:34.639 --> 03:35.511
Elliot, why?

03:35.712 --> 03:38.803
You knew that he was going to say that,
I thought that would hurt less coming from me.

03:39.135 --> 03:40.223
Well then thank you.

03:40.623 --> 03:41.599
Let's do this!

03:43.919 --> 03:46.185
- Could you help me with something?
- You. Me. Help.

03:46.647 --> 03:47.759
Of course, Dr. Dorian.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.100
All right, Denise.

03:49.141 --> 03:51.840
I'm going to kick your butt
with scut work for a while.

03:51.885 --> 03:54.345
Still, I really want you
to be yourself around me.

03:54.394 --> 03:55.769
Do you really mean that, sir?

03:56.004 --> 03:58.949
<i>Sir!
Loving this girl's energy.</i>

03:58.950 --> 04:01.383
I mean every word, young miss.

04:01.951 --> 04:06.023
Well, buddy. You have no idea
how psyched I am to hear that.

04:06.024 --> 04:08.621
I mean, I spent
four years in med school,

04:08.622 --> 04:11.702
talking like this, so I wouldn't
dare threaten all the male teachers

04:11.753 --> 04:14.367
who pee their pants every time
they're even near a strong woman.

04:14.602 --> 04:17.712
Seriously, I am so happy
to be done with all that,

04:17.713 --> 04:19.250
I could drop a doose right here.

04:20.237 --> 04:23.667
Well, don't do that here, Denise.
Cause this is a hospital.

04:24.277 --> 04:26.221
<i>What in god's name just happened?</i>

04:26.222 --> 04:28.211
By the way,
how can you stand these scrubs?

04:28.212 --> 04:31.275
Mine are so far up my butt right now,
I can taste them in my throat.

04:31.510 --> 04:34.397
You don't have to be yourself
all the time, just some of the time.

04:35.169 --> 04:36.665
It's Ed?

04:36.666 --> 04:38.613
Sometimes, I go by Big Ed.

04:39.147 --> 04:42.401
So, Ed. After you place
a central line one that patient,

04:42.436 --> 04:44.327
come and find me, and let me know
whether or not you killed him.

04:44.528 --> 04:45.569
Big Ed.

04:46.557 --> 04:50.097
Dr. Cox, I just wanted to tell you
I really enjoyed rounds this morning.

04:50.098 --> 04:53.633
And I'm going to work harder
so you don't just think of me as a...

04:55.011 --> 04:57.939
- What was it?
- A helpless vapid incompetent ass-kisser.

04:57.940 --> 05:00.631
Actually, I don't remember
the "ass-kisser" part.

05:00.632 --> 05:02.475
That's cause I just added it now.

05:02.476 --> 05:04.889
It's great.
Makes it hurt more.

05:05.329 --> 05:06.345
Great.

05:07.121 --> 05:08.145
Katie.

05:09.009 --> 05:11.609
- You don't have to do that.
- I know.

05:11.810 --> 05:13.648
It's disgusting.

05:14.349 --> 05:16.820
You're just under so much pressure,
I've been there.

05:16.921 --> 05:19.100
- Really?
- Oh my god, my first week here,

05:19.135 --> 05:22.037
I totally screwed my best friend, JD,
just to look good in rounds.

05:22.238 --> 05:24.143
Well, not literally screwed.

05:24.144 --> 05:28.327
I mean. Yes, later, we did it. But that
was for totally different reasons.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.571
And honestly,
there's been talk to death.

05:30.612 --> 05:32.418
But, we are dating again.
Don't tell anyone.

05:32.733 --> 05:33.818
Got it.

05:35.451 --> 05:38.747
- Don't bother me, I'm busy.
- I can't make any promises.

05:38.748 --> 05:41.451
Dr. Cox! Got those
test results for you, man.

05:41.452 --> 05:44.177
You were totally right about
that old dude in bed four.

05:44.178 --> 05:45.825
Sy-Sy-Sy-Syphilis!

05:48.312 --> 05:50.007
I just-- I used to be a deejay.

05:50.349 --> 05:51.153
Sy-Sy-Sy-Syphilis!

05:51.154 --> 05:52.795
Syphilis, syphilis,
syphilis...

05:55.851 --> 05:56.875
Get out of here, Ed.

05:57.176 --> 05:58.717
- Right now?
- Yeah.

06:00.973 --> 06:02.045
Come here.

06:03.261 --> 06:04.733
Why do I hate that guy?

06:08.251 --> 06:10.988
So, how long have you two been
dealing with the lung cancer?

06:11.189 --> 06:14.526
Well. Jack's last cycle of chemo
was about a year ago.

06:14.727 --> 06:17.373
And since then,
there's been no beta symptoms.

06:17.482 --> 06:21.015
And his last chest scans
showed no new lesions, so...

06:21.389 --> 06:22.695
Speaking of new things...

06:22.796 --> 06:25.017
<i>Not the time to talk
about your beard.</i>

06:25.052 --> 06:27.121
I'm sorry, I interrupted you.
Lesions.

06:27.523 --> 06:29.747
Anyway, we've just been
feeling so positive

06:29.748 --> 06:32.229
that we haven't even told
our son about the cancer yet.

06:32.691 --> 06:34.171
Mike is only eight.

06:34.302 --> 06:36.545
Hopefully, this is just
a minor infection right now.

06:36.586 --> 06:38.077
Okay, we're going
to run some tests.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.562
He needs
a new chest scan right away.

06:40.563 --> 06:43.021
And don't let those idiots
in radiology hold you up.

06:43.056 --> 06:46.319
Dr. Dorian, if they pull any crap,
I'll bust some heads.

06:46.320 --> 06:50.879
<i>She really is like having my very own Jo
from Facts of Life.</i>

06:50.880 --> 06:53.399
<i>Throw her a bone,
so she knows she's growing on you.</i>

06:53.600 --> 06:57.423
Denise, call me JD.
Dr. Dorian is my father.

06:57.624 --> 06:59.415
Actually, he's Mr. Dorian.

06:59.416 --> 07:02.761
Well, was Mr. Dorian. He's dead, Jo.
He's never coming back.

07:02.962 --> 07:04.205
You called me Jo?

07:04.206 --> 07:06.005
You don't like that
as a new nickname?

07:06.006 --> 07:09.369
Just a little butch.
I like banging dudes, so...

07:10.059 --> 07:11.170
I've heard that's nice.

07:13.069 --> 07:16.153
Seems like you'll be a host to
a variety of infectious bacteria...

07:16.178 --> 07:18.613
- ...or even fungus.
- Plus, it's hard to look at.

07:19.079 --> 07:20.869
I recommend it's removed immediately.

07:21.919 --> 07:23.047
Forget it, you guys!

07:23.048 --> 07:26.259
I'm keeping the beard.
Chicks dig on the extra fuzz.

07:26.260 --> 07:27.443
Tell me about it.

07:27.544 --> 07:30.025
And you've only got it on
two percent of your body.

07:30.026 --> 07:33.853
Hey, what is up, guys?
Can somebody give me a high-four?

07:34.354 --> 07:36.563
- Coming at you.
- No!

07:41.191 --> 07:42.487
Four!

07:44.695 --> 07:45.831
Grover five.

07:46.673 --> 07:47.880
Come on buddy, let's go.

07:49.299 --> 07:50.421
Hey, was that Dr. Turk?

07:50.922 --> 07:51.982
Yeah, why?

07:52.030 --> 07:54.813
Well, everyone's trying
to figure out who he is, because...

07:55.114 --> 07:56.075
He's going to pick an intern

07:56.126 --> 07:58.523
to do all the medical research
on a paper he's publishing.

07:58.524 --> 08:00.117
So, did you put yourself up for that?

08:00.252 --> 08:02.909
I'm not exactly
super confident right now.

08:02.910 --> 08:03.943
Katie.

08:04.499 --> 08:05.646
When I was an intern,

08:05.687 --> 08:08.246
this oncologist asked me to assist him
with his research,

08:08.281 --> 08:11.103
and I was too intimated.
And so I said no.

08:11.338 --> 08:13.826
So, then he offers it
to this other girl, Gina.

08:13.861 --> 08:15.455
And I really regretted it.

08:15.656 --> 08:19.464
You know. At least until we found out
that he was actually watching Gina wiz

08:19.465 --> 08:21.354
through a hole in his office wall.

08:21.355 --> 08:23.894
But had he not been a perv,
it would still haunt me.

08:24.377 --> 08:26.601
Which is why you're going
to go for this, okay?

08:27.616 --> 08:28.791
Okay.

08:29.953 --> 08:30.965
Bear claw!

08:35.097 --> 08:37.763
So maybe you don't like him
because he freaky stoner weirdo.

08:37.764 --> 08:40.142
No, surprisingly that tickles me.

08:40.506 --> 08:42.212
- Did he say "Back in the day"?
- No.

08:42.248 --> 08:44.179
- Did he say "Back in the dizz-ay"?
- No.

08:44.215 --> 08:46.948
- Did he call you Dr. C?
- He did, but I liked it.

08:47.523 --> 08:50.321
- Does he like Hugh Jackman?
- Wrong again. You suck at this.

08:51.129 --> 08:53.806
Perhaps, the problem lies within.

08:53.807 --> 08:55.895
By creating false hatred for others,

08:55.933 --> 08:58.564
you don't have to face the fact
that you really hate yourself.

08:58.968 --> 09:00.765
Where did you get that,
psychobabble?

09:00.914 --> 09:02.413
From some skank at the mall.

09:02.714 --> 09:04.759
I chill at the food court
on the weekend.

09:05.247 --> 09:06.215
Donnie, I'm out.

09:09.024 --> 09:10.975
Want one?
I got pull here.

09:11.021 --> 09:12.069
Donnie!

09:15.667 --> 09:17.310
Hey, what are you guys looking at?

09:17.511 --> 09:19.921
Oh, my god!
Is it a picture of a poo?

09:19.922 --> 09:21.971
No, that's not just any poo, Elliott.

09:22.472 --> 09:24.336
That's Izzy's first poo in the potty.

09:24.737 --> 09:27.426
I can't take my eyes off it.
It's gorgeous.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.764
Oh, I accidently hit "Send".

09:33.090 --> 09:34.041
They're back.

09:35.024 --> 09:35.959
Jack's are bigger.

09:36.732 --> 09:38.468
Just found my new screensaver.

09:39.755 --> 09:40.739
They're back.

09:43.221 --> 09:44.225
My bad.

09:46.212 --> 09:47.167
Thank you.

09:48.255 --> 09:51.039
Anyway, Turk. My intern Katie
could really use a boost.

09:51.040 --> 09:53.637
Would you do me a favor and consider
her for the paper that you're doing?

09:53.638 --> 09:54.788
Sure, no problem.

09:54.889 --> 09:56.610
Oh! Thanks, man.
I owe you one.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.352
My god, look at these.

09:59.235 --> 10:01.932
The owner of those lungs
is going to die like... yesterday.

10:02.402 --> 10:05.496
It's Mr Fremont, patient of mine.
His son's eight years old.

10:06.455 --> 10:07.484
Sorry, buddy.

10:09.001 --> 10:10.234
Got to go tell Denise.

10:10.829 --> 10:13.622
<i>As a doctor, you can spend as much
time and energy on your interns</i>

10:13.663 --> 10:15.297
<i>as you do on your patients.</i>

10:15.777 --> 10:17.513
<i>Whether you're frustated by them...</i>

10:17.714 --> 10:19.664
Well, I finished
my double hot chocolate,

10:19.708 --> 10:21.533
and I'm going to head up.
Do you guys need anything else?

10:21.873 --> 10:23.137
No, thank you.

10:24.535 --> 10:25.335
All right.

10:25.536 --> 10:28.927
No, it is not just me.
He is hateful.

10:31.616 --> 10:32.797
<i>Or rooting for them.</i>

10:33.498 --> 10:35.139
Okay, I want to thank
everyone who applied.

10:35.240 --> 10:38.319
Unfortunately,
I can only pick one. So...

10:39.595 --> 10:41.555
Ed, congratulations!

10:41.856 --> 10:44.403
Oh, sorry, man. I'm listening to
<i>Da Vinci Code</i> on audio book.

10:44.484 --> 10:46.261
It's-- it's riveting.

10:48.431 --> 10:49.311
Damn it.

10:51.469 --> 10:53.293
No way!

10:54.225 --> 10:55.999
That was that guy?

10:56.627 --> 10:59.168
<i>For me, I was just hoping to figure out
a way how to tell Denise</i>

10:59.208 --> 11:01.877
<i>that the first patient we were
treating together was going to die.</i>

11:02.169 --> 11:05.276
Listen, Jo.
Mr. Fremont's scan came back.

11:05.277 --> 11:08.351
And, his lungs
are covered in lesions.

11:09.025 --> 11:10.385
He doesn't have a lot a time.

11:10.886 --> 11:14.017
<i>I was glad I was here because I knew
it would be hard for her to deal with.</i>

11:14.618 --> 11:16.592
Huh. Sucks to be him.

11:17.781 --> 11:18.590
<i>Or not.</i>

11:23.514 --> 11:25.387
I think I see what the problem is.

11:26.423 --> 11:28.359
You have a hand inside of you.

11:28.500 --> 11:31.939
That explains so many things.

11:33.836 --> 11:36.639
Dude, been having fantasies
about muppets all day too?

11:36.740 --> 11:38.310
No, I'm straight.

11:38.368 --> 11:40.759
That's just uncalled-for.
I'm freaked out.

11:40.760 --> 11:44.673
I told my intern Jo our patient
was dying, she barely even reacted.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.127
That sucks.

11:47.345 --> 11:49.291
I cannot believe
that Turk didn't pick you.

11:49.707 --> 11:51.650
Ooh, I'll just have
to withhold sex from him.

11:51.951 --> 11:54.155
I mean, not me, personnally.
But I'm best friend with his wife,

11:54.156 --> 11:57.066
and if I ask her to,
she will get him all worked up,

11:57.067 --> 12:00.076
and then say "That was for Elliott."
And then just roll over and go to sleep.

12:00.699 --> 12:02.513
I never really had a shot anyway.

12:02.914 --> 12:05.536
I mean, surgery is such a boys club.

12:06.144 --> 12:07.184
I don't know about that.

12:09.370 --> 12:11.306
I-just-pulled-your-pants-down-five.

12:13.864 --> 12:15.011
Maybe you're right.

12:16.325 --> 12:17.780
No sex for Turk tonight.

12:18.184 --> 12:18.979
Done.

12:18.980 --> 12:21.322
- Back to this intern that I hate...
- No!

12:21.363 --> 12:23.564
I don't want to play
"Why do I hate this intern?" game.

12:23.605 --> 12:25.267
It's no fun, nobody ever wins.

12:25.268 --> 12:28.526
Fine. I need to find somebody a little
more qualified to talk about hate anyway.

12:29.623 --> 12:31.874
Look, you and I are alike
in a lot of ways.

12:31.875 --> 12:35.353
We both harbor an internal stuggle
between the desire to do good,

12:35.414 --> 12:37.218
and the urge
to become a master criminal.

12:37.219 --> 12:39.000
- We don't
- We do.

12:39.254 --> 12:42.190
You hate people,
and I hate people.

12:42.233 --> 12:45.615
What nobody gets is that
we never hate indiscriminately.

12:45.716 --> 12:48.445
That is so true.
I only hate those that have wronged me.

12:48.646 --> 12:51.804
Like if they stole my stuff,
or put a penny in a door.

12:52.609 --> 12:55.078
Or... that guy.

12:55.659 --> 12:58.043
See this look he shot us,
like he's so much better than we are.

12:58.244 --> 13:02.300
Plus, he's only 25, and earlier I heard
him use the phrase "Back in the day".

13:02.858 --> 13:05.064
Well, he's dug his own grave,
hasn't he? Let's do this.

13:05.365 --> 13:06.165
Go.

13:12.134 --> 13:14.442
- He's even worse than the other guy.
- Go get him too.

13:19.843 --> 13:21.446
All right, Denise. Here's the deal.

13:21.447 --> 13:24.791
We have to tell Mrs. Fremont that
her husband doesn't have much longer.

13:24.792 --> 13:27.184
She's going to want us to do
whatever we can to keep him alive.

13:27.235 --> 13:29.728
But we both know that put him
on a respirator is just going to

13:29.829 --> 13:32.508
prolong the inevitable and
eventually cause him more pain.

13:33.254 --> 13:35.672
So, I'm going to tell her
the initial bad news.

13:35.873 --> 13:38.824
And then, I want you to come in and
secure the "Do Not Resuscitate" order.

13:39.025 --> 13:40.130
Okay, JD.

13:43.127 --> 13:44.946
You're going to make her get the DNR?

13:45.357 --> 13:48.572
An intern shouldn't have to convince
a wife to let her husband die.

13:48.688 --> 13:50.376
She's got to learn
how to show some compassion.

13:50.433 --> 13:52.181
I'm throwing her in
at the deep end.

13:52.282 --> 13:54.330
There's got to be
a better way to teach that.

13:55.262 --> 13:56.760
Elmo would love to help.

13:56.911 --> 13:58.785
Denise, could you
come here for a second?

14:01.628 --> 14:04.144
You be the patient,
and I'll be the doctor.

14:05.216 --> 14:06.289
How's this?

14:06.903 --> 14:10.086
Don't worry, buddy.
I'm going to take care of you.

14:10.087 --> 14:13.299
Elmo knows that together,
we can get through this.

14:13.889 --> 14:15.640
And... Scene.

14:16.312 --> 14:17.348
I get it know.

14:17.349 --> 14:20.192
Oh yeah!
She gets it, she gets it!

14:20.193 --> 14:22.970
Yeah, baby!
Yeah, baby, yeah baby!

14:23.171 --> 14:24.402
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

14:25.257 --> 14:26.488
Okay, easy buddy.

14:26.589 --> 14:27.689
What, she's your woman?

14:28.582 --> 14:30.362
What is Elmo? A seal?

14:32.712 --> 14:35.262
- Turk, I'm so mad at you.
- Yeah, I know.

14:35.697 --> 14:38.204
Carla dragged me to the
on-call room, stripped butt naked,

14:38.205 --> 14:40.873
did a little belly dance,
and then said "This is for Elliot".

14:41.074 --> 14:43.405
Then took a nap!
What the hell did I did to you?

14:43.506 --> 14:44.644
You're a sexist.

14:45.706 --> 14:47.258
Keep moving, Rhonda!

14:48.030 --> 14:49.880
You ain't moving fast enough, Rhonda!

14:50.638 --> 14:53.129
Admit it. Katie never had a chance
with you because she's a girl.

14:53.330 --> 14:55.716
- That's ridiculous.
- Really? Besides me...

14:55.751 --> 14:58.104
Can you even name one other girl
that you're friends with?

14:58.105 --> 15:01.333
Carla, and a lovely woman
by the name of Margaret.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.446
Carla is your wife,
and Margaret's your mother!

15:03.447 --> 15:04.910
Elliott, don't talk
about my momma!

15:04.991 --> 15:06.770
Allright, I will
punch you in the head!

15:06.871 --> 15:08.487
Turk, I was Katie once.

15:08.608 --> 15:09.505
I mean, I know what it feels like

15:09.555 --> 15:11.852
to get past over
because you're not one of the boys.

15:12.486 --> 15:14.348
Okay, fine. I should
have given Katie a chance.

15:15.874 --> 15:16.762
Guess what?

15:16.980 --> 15:18.694
Ed's going to let me take his spot.

15:19.195 --> 15:20.268
I didn't want to do it anyway.

15:20.319 --> 15:22.674
The only reason I signed up was
I have this three-way pen,

15:22.675 --> 15:24.970
and I wanted to write my name
in three different colors.

15:25.426 --> 15:27.246
Dude, that's why I picked you.

15:27.307 --> 15:29.916
- Looks cool, right?
- It looks so cool.

15:30.492 --> 15:32.076
So Katie gets to do it?

15:34.402 --> 15:35.232
Fine!

15:35.433 --> 15:36.752
Blow it up, girl!

15:39.416 --> 15:40.358
That's it.

15:40.759 --> 15:42.048
I know why I hate him.

15:42.249 --> 15:44.268
Way to go.
Want to borrow my plunger?

15:45.370 --> 15:47.338
Form a perfect seal
around his mouth, and then...

15:48.004 --> 15:50.928
Three times, and...
His Adam's apple pops right out.

15:53.572 --> 15:54.612
Theoretically.

15:58.024 --> 15:59.150
Mrs. Fremont.

16:00.266 --> 16:02.500
Your husband doesn't
have a minor infection.

16:03.734 --> 16:05.162
It's the cancer.

16:07.296 --> 16:10.114
His body is basically shutting down.

16:12.254 --> 16:13.354
He's dying?

16:15.030 --> 16:16.042
I'm sorry.

16:17.328 --> 16:20.428
No. No, he's been
doing so well. No.

16:20.685 --> 16:23.874
It's not time yet. There must
be something that you can do.

16:24.510 --> 16:26.246
Well, we can make him confortable.

16:27.862 --> 16:30.870
But, by the end of the night,
he won't be able to breath on his own.

16:31.738 --> 16:33.538
So, you'll put him on a machine.

16:35.352 --> 16:36.972
I'm not sure you want to do that.

16:37.473 --> 16:39.150
Why?
Why wouldn't I want to do that?

16:39.205 --> 16:41.572
Why wouldn't I want to do
anything I can to keep him alive?

16:43.654 --> 16:45.050
<i>This was going to be rough on Denise,</i>

16:45.131 --> 16:46.587
<i>but I knew it was something
she had to get through</i>

16:46.643 --> 16:48.590
<i>to become
a more compassionate doctor.</i>

16:49.464 --> 16:50.296
Look.

16:51.098 --> 16:52.129
Here's the deal.

16:52.566 --> 16:53.740
If you make us intubate him,

16:53.787 --> 16:56.251
we're probably also going to have
to shove a catheter in his lungs.

16:56.295 --> 16:59.452
And that sort of thing usually leads
to an infection, and antibiotics,

16:59.503 --> 17:02.671
and then, before you know it,
his kidneys are toast.

17:02.872 --> 17:05.914
So, even with all our
poking and proding,

17:06.310 --> 17:08.518
we're still not going to
slow down his cancer.

17:08.785 --> 17:10.506
So, you'll finally sign the DNR.

17:10.406 --> 17:13.140
But, by then, he would have suffer
way more than he needed to, because...

17:13.569 --> 17:15.650
You were just
too selfish to let him go.

17:22.468 --> 17:24.094
The real Jo never
would have done that.

17:26.569 --> 17:28.844
- Hey, skank!
- What up, skank?

17:29.045 --> 17:30.926
It's all good, skank!

17:31.333 --> 17:32.746
We like to call each other "skank".

17:33.154 --> 17:35.308
Okay, I know
I was a little bit sexist earlier.

17:35.722 --> 17:36.824
But, don't you also think

17:36.873 --> 17:39.410
Katie might have been playing you
a little so she could get ahead?

17:39.800 --> 17:41.154
Turk, she wasn't even going to sign up

17:41.208 --> 17:43.512
to help you with your
stupid paper until I told her to.

17:43.619 --> 17:45.692
That's funny, because
I went back and checked.

17:45.893 --> 17:48.962
And Katie was the
first intern to sign the sheet.

17:49.456 --> 17:51.426
See. It's her name right there.

17:51.845 --> 17:52.974
Above Ed's.

17:54.622 --> 17:55.914
Skank!

17:58.058 --> 17:59.382
Time to go.

17:59.383 --> 18:01.110
Donnie, I need a way-homer.

18:03.135 --> 18:04.798
See you tomorrow, everybody.

18:04.799 --> 18:06.246
Goodbye Bob!

18:06.301 --> 18:07.394
Syphilis!

18:11.396 --> 18:14.030
You zwah'd the hell out of me,
Dr. Cox. It's like you promised.

18:14.304 --> 18:17.684
See, I've seen a lot of
crazy things in my life.

18:18.022 --> 18:20.860
But trust me, I've never seen
an intern with the time to just

18:20.901 --> 18:25.166
hang out in a coffee shop. And it wasn't
until you gave up that research paper,

18:25.658 --> 18:28.290
that I finally realized why I hate you.

18:29.192 --> 18:30.132
You're lazy.

18:30.896 --> 18:32.596
Am I not doing
as well as the other interns?

18:33.438 --> 18:35.292
You are doing better than most.

18:35.493 --> 18:37.586
I don't know, I'm fine with
better than most.

18:37.587 --> 18:39.566
But if that's not being the case,
let me know.

18:39.868 --> 18:41.848
Believe me, I will.

18:42.506 --> 18:43.658
Thanks, Dr. C.

18:54.432 --> 18:56.416
I always knew this day would come.

18:57.161 --> 18:59.217
How can I still not be ready?

19:01.149 --> 19:02.421
Nobody ever is.

19:03.987 --> 19:05.247
What should I do know?

19:06.527 --> 19:08.091
You should go pick up your son.

19:10.453 --> 19:13.530
We'll do our best to wake him up
so you two can say goodbye.

19:19.443 --> 19:22.495
<i>And then I realized why I'd thought
about </i> Sesame Street <i> all day.</i>

19:23.157 --> 19:26.794
<i>In a way, you can learn everything you
need to know from watching it as a kid.</i>

19:27.447 --> 19:29.627
<i>Like, always play nice.</i>

19:29.907 --> 19:33.449
Oh please. I've got Dr. Reid
wrapped around my finger.

19:34.081 --> 19:36.241
I'm going to be fine around here.

19:39.298 --> 19:41.021
<i>Always try your hardest.</i>

19:41.022 --> 19:42.845
Hey, do you go to the
hematology lecture tonight?

19:42.906 --> 19:45.818
No, can't do, other Indian guy.
'Bout to go get me some pizza!

19:53.133 --> 19:54.206
<i>And even...</i>

19:54.961 --> 19:56.421
<i>It's okay to cry.</i>

19:58.865 --> 20:00.789
Yeah, you were right.
He didn't last long at all.

20:05.147 --> 20:06.963
Didn't expect the waterworks.

20:10.236 --> 20:11.236
See you tomorrow.

20:17.451 --> 20:19.603
It's going to be a long year.

20:30.201 --> 20:32.768
By then, he would have suffer
way more than he needed to, because...

20:32.969 --> 20:35.051
You were just
too selfish to let him go.

20:35.559 --> 20:37.071
I'll let you think about it.

20:40.937 --> 20:42.587
The real Jo never
would have done that.

20:44.211 --> 20:45.576
What she was tring to say is...

20:46.090 --> 20:49.738
You take the good, you take the bad,
and when you take them both,

20:51.213 --> 20:53.199
There you have the facts of life.
