00:00.697 --> 00:01.596
<i>Previously on "Heartland"...</i>

00:01.698 --> 00:03.598
I am entitled to say,
Ty Borden,

00:03.700 --> 00:06.134
that you have completed
your probation period successfully.

00:06.236 --> 00:06.964
Thanks.

00:07.071 --> 00:08.402
Good luck with the rest of your life.

00:08.505 --> 00:09.836
- I'm telling you the truth.
- Yeah.

00:09.940 --> 00:12.272
You and Ashley alone all night
just talking.

00:12.376 --> 00:13.172
Yeah.

00:13.277 --> 00:14.938
He's the only guy
that really gets me, you know?

00:15.045 --> 00:18.708
Getting what he wants
is probably closer to the truth.

00:18.816 --> 00:20.249
Amy.

00:20.384 --> 00:23.012
- Don't talk to me, Caleb.
- It's not what it looks like.

00:23.754 --> 00:26.086
Bedford Oil could build a pump
right there,

00:26.190 --> 00:27.919
and there'd be nothing
you could do about it.

00:28.025 --> 00:28.923
Oh, yes, there is.

00:29.026 --> 00:31.290
Hi. P.W. Morris.

00:35.833 --> 00:37.630
You are supposed to be Peter.

00:38.769 --> 00:40.259
You own Bedford Oil.

00:40.370 --> 00:41.359
Yeah.

00:41.472 --> 00:42.666
This can never work.

00:42.773 --> 00:44.707
You stand for things
that make my blood boil.

00:44.808 --> 00:46.901
- Keep things interesting, right?
- Good-bye.

00:51.381 --> 00:53.906
Okay. Try it now.

00:56.386 --> 00:59.116
Hey! There you go.

00:59.223 --> 01:01.191
Awesome. Good as new.

01:01.358 --> 01:02.882
Your dad was right
about the condenser.

01:02.993 --> 01:05.553
Well, there's two things
my dad knows everything about.

01:05.662 --> 01:07.755
Cows and cars.

01:07.865 --> 01:09.457
Hey, thanks for your help, Amy.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.862
All I did was turn the key.

01:10.968 --> 01:14.597
You know what?
We should pimp this baby up, hmm?

01:14.705 --> 01:16.764
Spoiler. Neon lights. Come on.

01:16.874 --> 01:18.398
- I don't know.
- Supercharge the engine.

01:18.509 --> 01:19.737
Chicks dig the truck the way it is.

01:19.910 --> 01:22.105
Oh, they do, do they?

01:24.581 --> 01:27.880
Hey, Ty. Clint's here.
We should probably go inside.

01:27.985 --> 01:28.713
Who's Clint?

01:29.987 --> 01:32.717
- Ty's old pro...
- Professional wrestler.

01:33.991 --> 01:35.219
A wrestler?

01:35.325 --> 01:36.917
Well, he's an old friend
from Calgary.

01:37.027 --> 01:39.962
He used to wrestle.

01:41.165 --> 01:44.464
Well, I should probably get going.
I'll see you tonight.

01:50.207 --> 01:52.767
So, I trust Lou
got you and the kids

01:52.876 --> 01:55.344
settled into the dude ranch
okay last night.

01:55.445 --> 01:56.776
She did, Jack, thanks.

01:56.880 --> 01:58.074
What's this?

01:58.182 --> 02:00.173
Well, when you're dealing
with kids on probation,

02:00.284 --> 02:02.309
it's very important
to stick to a schedule.

02:02.419 --> 02:03.977
Now, this weekend in the country,

02:04.087 --> 02:06.248
it isn't just about,
you know, having fun.

02:06.356 --> 02:08.687
It's about rehabilitation,
reintegration.

02:08.792 --> 02:12.193
This is very comprehensive.

02:12.296 --> 02:13.194
Well, yeah.

02:13.330 --> 02:15.059
I didn't want to leave
anything to chance.

02:15.165 --> 02:16.757
You know,
these kids need structure.

02:16.867 --> 02:18.732
It's all part of what
the new probation is all about.

02:19.136 --> 02:19.898
Right.

02:20.003 --> 02:22.938
Well, we will certainly do our best
to stick to your schedule.

02:23.040 --> 02:25.235
But do you really think
it was a good idea

02:25.342 --> 02:27.435
to leave those kids out there
all on their own,

02:27.544 --> 02:29.739
you know, unsupervised?

02:29.846 --> 02:30.870
Don't worry, Lou.

02:30.981 --> 02:32.471
They were fast asleep
when I left them.

02:32.583 --> 02:35.074
And besides, they're way out
in the middle of nowhere.

02:35.185 --> 02:37.653
What trouble could
they possibly get into?

02:39.000 --> 02:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:56.607 --> 02:59.599
Well, the young Ty Borden.

02:59.743 --> 03:00.539
Clint.

03:00.644 --> 03:02.077
Keeping your nose clean?

03:02.179 --> 03:03.476
Yeah, I guess.

03:03.580 --> 03:05.878
Amy, why don't you and Ty
drive up to the cabins

03:05.983 --> 03:07.644
and bring our guests back
for breakfast?

03:07.751 --> 03:08.911
- Sure.
- Oh, Jack.

03:09.019 --> 03:12.147
According to the itinerary,
breakfast isn't served until 8:30 a.m.

03:12.256 --> 03:13.382
Yeah. There it is.

03:13.490 --> 03:14.616
I see.

03:14.725 --> 03:17.990
Well, we tend to eat
a little earlier around here.

03:18.095 --> 03:20.563
Well, okay. I suppose
a good, healthy breakfast

03:20.664 --> 03:23.189
a little earlier in the day
could be therapeutic.

03:38.682 --> 03:41.173
So, that was pretty smooth
back there.

03:41.285 --> 03:42.752
What was?

03:42.853 --> 03:46.812
Oh, just Clint Riley, the wrestler.

03:46.923 --> 03:48.618
Yeah, well, I just haven't got around

03:48.725 --> 03:51.216
to telling Kit about
the whole probation thing, so...

03:51.328 --> 03:53.558
- Oh, my God!
- Relax. It's not that big a deal.

03:53.664 --> 03:55.791
No. Look.

04:44.414 --> 04:45.176
I checked the cabins.

04:45.282 --> 04:46.476
There's no sign of the kids anywhere.

04:46.583 --> 04:47.572
Well, they couldn't have gotten far.

04:47.684 --> 04:49.481
Not without a horse or...

04:49.586 --> 04:51.247
Truck.

04:52.089 --> 04:53.454
Hey!

04:53.557 --> 04:56.117
Hey!

04:56.326 --> 04:57.384
Grandpa, hi.

05:08.839 --> 05:10.636
Howdy, Clint.

05:12.175 --> 05:13.301
We was just heading out

05:13.410 --> 05:16.004
to rassle ourselves up
some breakfast.

05:16.113 --> 05:18.343
Weren't we, Badger?

05:25.555 --> 05:28.752
Willful destruction
of private property.

05:28.859 --> 05:30.884
It was just a little campfire.

05:30.994 --> 05:32.928
If I was a Boy Scout,
they'd give me a badge.

05:33.029 --> 05:35.463
Theft of Ty Borden's automobile.

05:35.565 --> 05:37.157
Are you kidding me?

05:37.300 --> 05:39.928
Someone actually owns
the craptasticmobile.

05:40.036 --> 05:43.199
Tara, I'd like you to apologize
to Lou.

05:43.306 --> 05:44.898
Remember that we're guests here.

05:45.008 --> 05:46.475
Apologize for what?

05:46.576 --> 05:48.601
Those cabins weren't heated.

05:48.712 --> 05:50.475
We almost froze to death out there.

05:50.580 --> 05:52.275
We had two choices...
build a fire

05:52.382 --> 05:55.476
or die a cold, Ionely,
miserable, writhing death.

05:56.853 --> 05:58.650
So, we chose fire.

05:58.755 --> 06:02.521
Usually when guests are cold,
they build a fire inside the cabin.

06:02.626 --> 06:05.356
You know, in that thing
called the fireplace.

06:05.462 --> 06:07.623
Well, we couldn't stay inside.

06:07.731 --> 06:10.256
Your cabins are infested
with vermin.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.197
Uh-huh, vermin.

06:12.302 --> 06:14.930
You heard me. Vermin.

06:16.039 --> 06:18.166
- Tara...
- I have proof. Okay?

06:18.275 --> 06:21.972
Badger, show them
what we found in the cabin.

06:42.132 --> 06:44.498
I grew up on this ranch.

06:44.601 --> 06:47.661
Do you really think I'm afraid
of a little bull snake?

06:47.771 --> 06:49.500
You're gonna have to do
better than that.

06:49.606 --> 06:51.574
'Cause there's only one thing
at this table

06:51.675 --> 06:53.643
anyone should be scared of,

06:53.743 --> 06:56.769
and that is me.

06:57.681 --> 07:00.149
I'll give you a hand with that, Lou.

07:01.852 --> 07:04.343
I will deal with you two
when I get back.

07:22.839 --> 07:25.672
It's a pretty nice day out.

07:26.176 --> 07:29.976
Might be one of the last ones left
before winter.

07:30.380 --> 07:32.814
Thought maybe you might want
to go for a ride.

07:32.916 --> 07:35.817
Don't you have a houseguest
you should probably get back to?

07:35.919 --> 07:41.221
Look, I know it's weird
that Ashley's staying with me, but...

07:41.324 --> 07:42.916
If you think anything's
going on between us,

07:43.026 --> 07:44.687
you got this whole thing wrong.

07:44.794 --> 07:46.261
You lied to me, Caleb.

07:47.731 --> 07:50.598
You're right.
I should have told you the truth.

07:50.700 --> 07:51.462
I'm sorry.

07:53.370 --> 07:55.770
I just... I don't trust her.

07:55.872 --> 07:59.103
Then, trust me.

07:59.209 --> 08:01.769
Why can't you just ask her
to find another place to stay?

08:01.878 --> 08:04.847
She's got nowhere else to go.

08:04.948 --> 08:07.314
She just needs a few more days
to figure things out.

08:07.417 --> 08:08.782
And until then...

08:08.885 --> 08:11.752
Yeah, I know.
I'm just gonna have to trust you.

08:14.291 --> 08:17.385
So, what do you say?
How 'bout that ride?

08:17.994 --> 08:19.518
I can't.

08:19.629 --> 08:22.291
But, well, if you got
nothing better to do,

08:22.399 --> 08:23.832
you can always help me feed.

08:24.834 --> 08:26.426
You got it.

08:32.909 --> 08:35.342
There weren't by any chance
any peanuts in those muffins,

08:35.445 --> 08:36.173
were there?

08:36.279 --> 08:40.078
Oh, no. We don't serve peanuts
to our guests in case of allergies.

08:41.183 --> 08:45.814
Right, right.
I read that in the pamphlet.

08:45.922 --> 08:48.948
I swore I tasted something nutty
in that last bite, though.

08:49.059 --> 08:50.856
Trace amounts,
they don't bother me.

08:50.961 --> 08:53.088
But I think I'm having
a severe reaction.

08:53.196 --> 08:54.993
Oh, my God.

08:55.098 --> 08:56.122
Here, Clint.

09:00.770 --> 09:01.930
That doesn't sound good.

09:02.038 --> 09:03.767
I think you need to drive him
to the hospital.

09:03.873 --> 09:04.931
Grandpa's got the truck.

09:05.041 --> 09:07.271
My truck's busted,
but I think Caleb's here.

09:07.377 --> 09:09.709
Okay. I'll go find Caleb.
You stay here with Clint.

09:09.813 --> 09:12.646
And just, you know,
make sure he doesn't, you know...

09:15.518 --> 09:17.816
You have to help those kids, Ty.

09:17.921 --> 09:19.548
If anybody can reach them, it's you.

09:19.656 --> 09:21.146
I think you're talking
to the wrong guy.

09:21.257 --> 09:22.656
I don't know anything about kids.

09:22.759 --> 09:24.727
You're the poster boy
for the success of this system.

09:24.828 --> 09:26.693
You've turned your life around.

09:26.830 --> 09:30.129
They can do the same.
They just need to know how.

09:40.744 --> 09:44.043
Don't waste your breath, Mother.
I'm not coming home.

09:44.981 --> 09:47.609
Well, that's not why I'm here.

09:47.717 --> 09:49.844
Rosalita made some pumpkin loaf
this morning,

09:49.953 --> 09:51.477
and I know how much
you like it, so...

09:51.655 --> 09:53.316
Should I put it in the kitchen?

09:53.423 --> 09:56.290
There is a kitchen in here, right?

09:56.393 --> 10:01.126
You came all the way here
to bring me a pumpkin loaf?

10:01.898 --> 10:04.560
Look, if you don't want it...

10:04.668 --> 10:07.535
No, I do.

10:08.805 --> 10:11.569
Tell Rosalita I say <i>gracias.</i>

10:11.675 --> 10:13.575
Okay.

10:13.677 --> 10:15.201
Bye.

10:19.883 --> 10:22.852
Look, I have to go into town
on Monday for an appointment.

10:22.952 --> 10:24.943
I was thinking maybe
you could come with me.

10:25.055 --> 10:27.922
Why? So I can wait around
while you get your roots dyed?

10:28.825 --> 10:31.225
No. I thought maybe...

10:33.697 --> 10:36.097
You know what?
Never mind.

10:36.766 --> 10:38.529
Just enjoy that pumpkin loaf.

10:48.311 --> 10:50.973
Hey, hands off the ceramics.

10:51.081 --> 10:53.049
Amy, we have got to do something
about these kids

10:53.149 --> 10:54.844
before they burn down
the rest of the ranch.

10:54.951 --> 10:56.384
Hey, don't look at me.

10:56.486 --> 10:58.977
I mean, problem horses I can handle.
But problem children?

10:59.086 --> 11:00.977
No... that's
somebody else's department.

11:03.093 --> 11:04.754
Well, I don't see
why we can't pull together

11:04.861 --> 11:06.795
and follow Clint's schedule.

11:06.896 --> 11:08.454
Okay, let's see. There.

11:08.565 --> 11:10.192
10:00 to 11:30. Riding lessons.

11:10.300 --> 11:12.734
You and Ty can handle that.

11:15.839 --> 11:17.329
I think I have a better idea.

11:17.440 --> 11:18.634
That's it.

11:18.742 --> 11:20.573
Make sure your reins
are nice and loose.

11:20.677 --> 11:21.939
You want to be the alpha horse,

11:22.045 --> 11:24.104
so you have to let him know
where you want to go.

11:24.214 --> 11:27.377
If you want to go left, you have to
make sure you're looking left.

11:27.484 --> 11:29.679
That's it, Badger.
You're doing great.

11:29.786 --> 11:30.548
Keep going.

11:30.653 --> 11:31.347
Hey.

11:31.454 --> 11:32.512
Use your leg.

11:32.689 --> 11:34.554
That was pretty ugly
back there, huh?

11:34.657 --> 11:36.022
- What was?
- That's good, Badger.

11:36.126 --> 11:37.252
Clint.

11:37.360 --> 11:39.089
- I feel pretty bad for the guy.
- Yeah.

11:39.229 --> 11:40.787
You know, it's funny, though,

11:40.897 --> 11:42.694
because Lou doesn't put peanuts
in anything.

11:42.832 --> 11:45.926
That is funny.
Like a total medical mystery.

11:46.102 --> 11:48.969
You're starting to look
like a real cowboy now.

11:49.072 --> 11:51.040
Who's the captain
of the cheer team?

11:51.141 --> 11:52.130
You mean Mallory.

11:53.543 --> 11:55.135
Oh, God. Here she comes.

11:55.245 --> 11:56.803
I'm gonna O.D. on perky.

11:58.248 --> 11:59.647
Ready to saddle up?

11:59.749 --> 12:01.478
Listen, Rainbow Brite.

12:01.584 --> 12:04.109
I don't do horses, ponies,
or unicorns.

12:04.220 --> 12:06.780
This guy does
a super-nice trail ride, so...

12:06.890 --> 12:09.222
You don't have to worry
about him spooking or anything,

12:09.325 --> 12:10.724
'cause he's old and deaf.

12:10.827 --> 12:13.853
You're deaf.
Get it away from me.

12:15.265 --> 12:18.200
Looks like Vampira
doesn't want to go for a ride.

12:24.574 --> 12:26.701
Yeah, I know his throat
is swollen shut,

12:26.810 --> 12:29.108
but he still has to call me.

12:33.683 --> 12:36.447
Yes, I'm still here.

12:36.553 --> 12:38.043
What?

12:38.154 --> 12:42.022
What do you mean
you can't come pick up the kids?

12:42.725 --> 12:44.522
Yes, I understand
that it's the weekend,

12:44.627 --> 12:47.095
but you need to understand
that Heartland Equestrian Connection

12:47.197 --> 12:49.995
is not a baby-sitting service.

12:50.366 --> 12:51.355
Fine.

12:51.534 --> 12:53.468
Yeah, just make sure
he has my cell phone number.

12:53.570 --> 12:55.333
Thank you.

12:56.573 --> 13:00.703
Wow. These riding lessons
are going really, really well.

13:00.810 --> 13:04.109
- Who are those from?
- Nobody.

13:05.682 --> 13:08.810
Okay, so, good news is,
looks like Clint is gonna be fine.

13:08.918 --> 13:10.783
They just have to wait
for the swelling to go down.

13:10.887 --> 13:12.252
That's a relief.

13:12.355 --> 13:14.619
Bad news is,
the kids are here overnight.

13:14.724 --> 13:16.692
So, that means Ty
is gonna bunk with Badger,

13:16.793 --> 13:17.919
and you are gonna bunk with...

13:18.094 --> 13:19.459
No, I'm not.

13:19.562 --> 13:21.792
Amy, I don't want to hear it, okay?

13:21.898 --> 13:23.559
I'm gonna try the hospital again.

13:37.714 --> 13:39.113
Peter.

13:43.519 --> 13:47.148
Hey, you can't smoke here.

13:49.092 --> 13:51.686
What, you got a hearing problem?
I said you can't smoke here, Badger.

13:51.794 --> 13:53.261
Put it out.

13:56.065 --> 13:57.327
I said you can't smoke here!

13:57.433 --> 13:58.866
If I catch you smoking here again...

13:58.968 --> 14:00.299
Stop it!

14:12.983 --> 14:14.644
Ty.

14:14.751 --> 14:15.877
What's going on?

14:16.019 --> 14:17.350
Nothing.

14:17.454 --> 14:19.581
Ever since Clint
and those kids got here

14:19.690 --> 14:22.318
you've been acting pretty weird.

14:22.426 --> 14:24.986
I'm fine, Amy.
It's just my damn truck.

14:25.095 --> 14:28.087
You can't hide out in here
all weekend.

14:28.198 --> 14:29.893
I'm not a camp counselor, Amy.

14:30.033 --> 14:32.092
It's not my job
to deal with those kids.

14:32.202 --> 14:34.102
Yeah, and it's not my job either.

14:34.204 --> 14:36.434
But with Clint gone, we're just
gonna have to make it work.

14:36.540 --> 14:38.701
At least you have
some experience with...

14:40.477 --> 14:41.876
With what?

14:44.715 --> 14:46.649
I just mean that you probably know

14:46.750 --> 14:49.344
a lot more about Tara and Badger
than I do.

14:50.721 --> 14:51.619
Why?

14:51.722 --> 14:54.054
Because I got into trouble
when I was a kid,

14:54.157 --> 14:55.419
that makes me an expert?

14:55.525 --> 14:56.514
You know what I mean.

14:56.626 --> 14:58.560
No, I don't know
what you mean, actually.

14:58.662 --> 15:00.857
If you think I'm gonna sit
around a fire with these kids,

15:00.964 --> 15:02.454
swap stories
about our hard-knock lives,

15:02.566 --> 15:03.533
and sing "Kumbaya,"

15:03.633 --> 15:05.726
you've seen one too many
after-school specials.

15:17.781 --> 15:19.715
Are you sure
I can't get you something, Jack?

15:19.816 --> 15:20.840
No, thanks.

15:20.951 --> 15:25.115
I'm just curious to know
why you called me here.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.014
Yeah.

15:28.125 --> 15:31.322
Well, you can relax.
It's nothing business-related.

15:33.597 --> 15:36.589
No, actually, it's...

15:36.597 --> 15:37.589
It's personal.

15:38.435 --> 15:40.335
I'm all ears.

15:42.172 --> 15:45.300
I have to have some tests done
on Monday in Calgary.

15:46.843 --> 15:48.743
Well, I hope
that's nothing serious.

15:48.845 --> 15:51.780
Well, my doctor is probably
just being overly cautious.

15:51.882 --> 15:55.045
But they have to put me under.

15:55.152 --> 15:57.848
And I was just wondering

15:57.954 --> 16:01.913
if you wouldn't mind
driving me there and back.

16:02.592 --> 16:06.426
I mean, I know.
It's kind of out of left field, huh?

16:06.596 --> 16:10.362
But actually I didn't know
who else to ask.

16:10.467 --> 16:14.028
Of course I'll drive you, Val.
You don't even have to ask.

16:14.704 --> 16:17.229
I appreciate it.

16:20.510 --> 16:22.978
I know this is none of my business.

16:23.079 --> 16:24.137
But don't you think

16:24.247 --> 16:26.374
you might want to mention this
to your daughter?

16:26.483 --> 16:28.110
No.

16:28.218 --> 16:31.654
No, I don't want to worry Ashley
over nothing.

16:31.755 --> 16:34.781
It's better this way.

16:34.891 --> 16:36.518
Trust me.

16:42.299 --> 16:43.823
<i>This is a charming,
delightful snake.</i>

16:43.934 --> 16:45.458
- <i>Really, she is.</i>
- <i>Charming?</i>

16:45.569 --> 16:47.434
- <i>Yeah. Her name is Bella.</i>
- <i>Bella, okay.</i>

16:47.537 --> 16:48.629
<i>She does a lot...</i>

16:49.406 --> 16:50.634
You did not just do that.

16:50.740 --> 16:53.208
I don't think Clint brought you here
so you could watch TV all day.

16:53.310 --> 16:55.005
I was just checking out
the big snake.

16:55.111 --> 16:56.135
You should have seen it.

16:56.246 --> 16:58.840
Right. So you're not avoiding
your riding lessons at all.

16:58.949 --> 17:01.213
Well, the thing
with my riding lessons

17:01.318 --> 17:03.752
is that I'm more
of an advanced intermediate,

17:03.854 --> 17:07.550
so the beginner class
is just not working for me.

17:07.691 --> 17:09.921
Mmm-hmm.
You're not afraid of horses at all?

17:10.026 --> 17:11.357
No.

17:11.461 --> 17:14.521
Good, because Mallory's
waiting for you in the barn.

17:20.569 --> 17:22.867
This is Copper. He's my horse.

17:22.973 --> 17:24.497
Well, sort of.

17:24.674 --> 17:26.005
I train him. I groom him.

17:26.108 --> 17:30.068
Anyway, he's a super-gentle horse,
so he's really good for beginners.

17:30.180 --> 17:32.114
Yeah, Hillary Duff,
before you, like,

17:32.215 --> 17:34.308
bust out into a musical number
or something,

17:34.417 --> 17:36.180
you should know
I'm not into horses.

17:36.353 --> 17:39.811
Okay, then, what are you into?

17:40.824 --> 17:41.992
I don't know.

17:42.192 --> 17:44.285
Music.

17:44.394 --> 17:46.726
Slasher movies.

17:46.830 --> 17:48.627
Japanese game shows.

17:48.732 --> 17:49.926
Boys.

17:50.033 --> 17:51.364
I'm into boys.

17:52.602 --> 17:53.899
Yeah, I bet.

17:54.004 --> 17:56.404
I'm sure they love you, too.
All that pep.

17:57.541 --> 17:58.940
I do all right.

18:01.044 --> 18:06.573
My last boyfriend got on my nerves,
so I zapped him with a stun gun.

18:09.252 --> 18:11.584
It's how I wound up on probation.

18:11.688 --> 18:12.848
Does that freak you out?

18:13.657 --> 18:14.749
No.

18:16.226 --> 18:20.128
I bet you've got a pink room,
like, filled with stuffed bunnies.

18:20.730 --> 18:24.063
And two perfect parents
who tuck you in every night.

18:24.167 --> 18:25.896
Am I right?

18:26.002 --> 18:28.664
Okay, I'm gonna saddle Copper up,
and then we can get started.

18:28.772 --> 18:32.173
I told you I don't want to ride
your stupid horse, okay?

18:32.275 --> 18:35.073
God, you horse girls
are so annoying.

18:35.178 --> 18:37.408
Okay. Why do you got to be
so mean about it?

18:37.581 --> 18:40.812
What are you gonna do?
Gonna call the warden?

18:40.917 --> 18:42.851
Maybe you could call
the Care Bears.

18:42.953 --> 18:45.183
They could come to Heartland
on a caring mission

18:45.288 --> 18:48.451
and cure me
with their Care Bear stare.

18:59.669 --> 19:01.227
Thanks.

19:02.272 --> 19:03.534
Hey, Lou.

19:03.707 --> 19:04.366
Oh!

19:04.474 --> 19:05.873
Oh, my God!

19:05.976 --> 19:08.103
I can't believe
I just did that again.

19:08.211 --> 19:09.473
It's okay.

19:09.579 --> 19:12.776
Ever since I met you,
my dry-cleaning bills have doubled.

19:12.882 --> 19:14.474
- It's, like, bizarre.
- I am so sorry.

19:14.584 --> 19:16.279
Don't be. Don't worry about it.
It's my fault.

19:16.386 --> 19:17.944
I should know by now
not to get in your way.

19:18.054 --> 19:18.986
No.

19:19.089 --> 19:21.319
You know, I'm such a klutz and...

19:21.424 --> 19:24.882
Wow, I am really embarrassed.
So, I'm just gonna go.

19:24.995 --> 19:27.429
Wait, wait, wait.
So, we're not gonna...

19:27.530 --> 19:29.498
...talk about the flowers I sent you
or anything?

19:29.599 --> 19:30.497
Peter, listen.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.067
I know what you're gonna say,
actually.

19:32.168 --> 19:34.136
And I totally agree.
Flowers are a lame gift.

19:34.237 --> 19:36.967
Incredibly lame, actually.
I'm gonna get you something better.

19:37.140 --> 19:39.768
This is not about the flowers, okay?

19:39.876 --> 19:41.537
What happened between us
was a mistake.

19:41.645 --> 19:44.512
And you know, just because
there's an attraction between us...

19:44.614 --> 19:46.275
Wait, wait, wait.

19:46.383 --> 19:48.214
There's an attraction?

19:48.318 --> 19:49.376
Isn't there?

19:49.486 --> 19:50.976
Yeah.

19:51.087 --> 19:52.349
Absolutely.

19:52.455 --> 19:54.047
That is not the point.

19:54.157 --> 19:57.285
The point is that...

19:58.294 --> 19:59.761
Maybe online things worked out.

19:59.863 --> 20:02.764
But in reality, we are
from different universes.

20:02.866 --> 20:05.733
I'm running a campaign
against the oil company you own.

20:05.835 --> 20:07.530
That is bound to get awkward, so...

20:08.738 --> 20:12.367
We just...
We have to be practical here.

20:12.475 --> 20:15.638
So, good-bye.

20:19.783 --> 20:22.547
<i>Allow us to kind of engage
and interact</i>

20:22.652 --> 20:24.643
<i>where she can move around
a little bit more.</i>

20:24.754 --> 20:26.051
<i>She's patient.</i>

20:26.156 --> 20:27.054
Down in front.

20:27.157 --> 20:30.183
You think you know everything
about me, but you don't.

20:30.326 --> 20:32.260
Okay, so yeah,
I do have a stuffed bunny,

20:32.362 --> 20:33.522
and his name's Knucklehead.

20:33.630 --> 20:35.427
But you were wrong
about all that other stuff.

20:35.532 --> 20:36.556
Like my parents.

20:36.666 --> 20:38.930
They don't tuck me in every night
because they're not here.

20:39.035 --> 20:40.969
They haven't been around
for months.

20:41.071 --> 20:42.766
So, that's why I live at Heartland.

20:42.872 --> 20:44.931
And, yeah, everyone
may seem nice and stuff,

20:45.041 --> 20:47.373
but nobody ever really
pays any attention to me.

20:47.477 --> 20:48.569
So, sometimes I feel

20:48.745 --> 20:52.442
the only one that's happy
to see me is Copper.

20:53.883 --> 20:55.817
Wow.

20:55.919 --> 20:58.945
Reese Witherspoon,
you really did deserve that Oscar.

20:59.689 --> 21:00.678
Okay.

21:00.790 --> 21:03.384
I don't really care
what you think about me.

21:03.526 --> 21:04.925
But just to let you know,

21:05.028 --> 21:08.327
you're not the only one
in the world with problems.

21:17.941 --> 21:20.171
Tangiers.

21:20.276 --> 21:22.107
Haven't heard them in a while.

21:23.146 --> 21:24.738
Yeah, well, I'm old.

21:24.848 --> 21:26.679
Obviously.

21:26.783 --> 21:29.809
Nobody listens
to trashy garage rock anymore.

21:29.919 --> 21:31.819
Now it's all about Hannah Montana.

21:32.655 --> 21:34.555
Yeah, well, Mallory can lend you
one of her albums

21:34.657 --> 21:36.352
if you're jonesing for a Miley fix.

21:36.459 --> 21:37.858
Yeah, right.

21:37.961 --> 21:41.795
You know, Clint said he used to be
your probation officer.

21:41.898 --> 21:44.594
What did you do?

21:44.701 --> 21:46.931
That's none of your business.

21:47.103 --> 21:49.663
Oh, it's like a big secret, huh?

21:49.773 --> 21:51.206
Whatever.

21:51.307 --> 21:54.470
It's not like I want to hear
some big sob story anyway.

21:54.577 --> 21:57.546
I'm just glad there's at least
one cool person here.

21:59.015 --> 22:01.882
I'm not cool. Believe me.

22:02.118 --> 22:04.018
You seem pretty cool to me.

22:04.120 --> 22:07.317
Of course, I always fall
for the moody, damaged types.

22:10.627 --> 22:13.653
If you like Tangiers,
you'll love these guys.

22:13.763 --> 22:15.993
They're called Hey Rosetta.

22:16.099 --> 22:19.660
Saw them live in Calgary last month.
They're wicked bad.

22:21.971 --> 22:24.371
Like total back-to-basics rock,
you know,

22:24.474 --> 22:28.410
without any of that earnest
post-grunge radio crap.

22:33.216 --> 22:34.308
Your boyfriend's here.

22:34.417 --> 22:36.715
He's not my boyfriend.

22:37.954 --> 22:40.752
Badger, leave me alone, okay?

22:40.857 --> 22:42.620
Stop being like a creepy stalker.

22:46.129 --> 22:47.790
Go.

22:52.135 --> 22:55.002
They're totally sick, right?

22:56.272 --> 22:58.069
Yeah, they're good.

23:26.402 --> 23:28.734
What's going on with the horses?

23:31.574 --> 23:32.905
How did they get out?

23:33.243 --> 23:36.735
Ty! Ty, come on!
I'll go after them!

23:48.091 --> 23:50.855
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

23:51.227 --> 23:52.819
Hey.

23:52.929 --> 23:54.487
Come on, Badger.
You don't want to do this.

23:54.597 --> 23:56.462
Come on.
Give me the hook.

23:58.201 --> 24:00.066
No! Okay, chill out! Badger!

24:00.904 --> 24:01.893
Relax.

24:02.071 --> 24:03.663
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

24:04.574 --> 24:06.269
I told you I was gonna
watch your back, okay?

24:06.376 --> 24:07.707
That's what I'm doing.

24:07.810 --> 24:08.936
Hey!

24:09.045 --> 24:11.605
Hand it over.

24:18.721 --> 24:19.983
Ty!

24:24.961 --> 24:26.326
What's going on in here?

24:28.998 --> 24:30.727
Nothing.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.594
I got it under control.

24:41.744 --> 24:43.905
Badger's simmered down a bit.

24:44.013 --> 24:47.312
He gets like that sometimes,
but he really wouldn't hurt anybody.

24:47.417 --> 24:50.853
- Yeah, right.
- He's not a bad guy.

24:50.954 --> 24:53.684
So, how come he never talks?

24:53.790 --> 24:56.918
I don't know. He just won't.

24:57.026 --> 25:00.393
All I know is what kids say about him
around the group home.

25:00.496 --> 25:02.657
His stepdad messed him up
quite a bit,

25:02.765 --> 25:06.667
so, sometimes
he freaks out about stuff.

25:08.504 --> 25:09.562
Hey, Ty.

25:09.706 --> 25:12.402
Thanks for not squealing on him.
I knew you wouldn't.

25:12.508 --> 25:14.533
What's that supposed to mean?

25:14.644 --> 25:17.875
Well, just that, that would make you
a hypocrite, wouldn't it?

25:17.981 --> 25:20.575
I mean, especially after
all the stuff you must have pulled

25:20.683 --> 25:22.344
when you were our age.

25:22.452 --> 25:24.010
Look, I don't know
what you've heard.

25:24.120 --> 25:26.179
But whatever you think you know
about me, you're wrong.

25:26.289 --> 25:28.086
So, like I said before,
mind your own business.

25:28.191 --> 25:32.025
God. You are such a drama queen.

25:33.196 --> 25:35.790
What is your problem?

25:43.740 --> 25:48.268
Are you gonna tell me what the heck
was going on out there?

25:48.378 --> 25:51.279
Let's just say the sooner
those kids leave, the better.

25:51.381 --> 25:55.147
I remember thinking the same thing
about you once.

25:55.251 --> 25:56.878
You know, when you first got here,

25:56.986 --> 26:01.855
I couldn't wait for you to mess up
so I could kick your ass out of here.

26:01.958 --> 26:06.019
And I almost did several times.

26:06.562 --> 26:08.860
But in the end,
you proved me wrong.

26:08.965 --> 26:12.128
You proved a lot of people wrong.

26:12.235 --> 26:16.934
So, maybe you ought to give
those kids a chance to do the same.

26:25.348 --> 26:28.875
Look, I'm sorry about the whole
Reese Witherspoon thing, okay?

26:28.985 --> 26:33.445
It's just you seem so perfect.

26:33.556 --> 26:35.046
Like, popular and stuff.

26:35.158 --> 26:38.889
Like you should be
student-council president.

26:38.995 --> 26:40.656
Are you kidding?

26:40.763 --> 26:44.290
All the kids at school
think I'm weird.

26:44.400 --> 26:47.369
Maybe you should bring me
to school with you on Monday.

26:47.470 --> 26:49.438
They'd have a whole new
definition of weird.

26:49.539 --> 26:53.031
Maybe they'd make you president
of the student council.

26:53.142 --> 26:55.633
I'm so sure.

26:56.446 --> 27:00.473
So, do you think maybe we could
start over with Cooper?

27:00.650 --> 27:02.174
Or Goober.

27:02.785 --> 27:04.013
Copper.

27:04.153 --> 27:06.121
Whatever.

27:06.522 --> 27:08.615
I thought you weren't into horses.

27:08.724 --> 27:10.851
I'm not.

27:10.960 --> 27:13.360
But this place doesn't have cable.

27:20.069 --> 27:22.230
That's some nasty wieners
and beans.

27:22.338 --> 27:22.997
Amy!

27:23.172 --> 27:24.469
Hey, you're just in time for dinner.

27:24.574 --> 27:25.871
Good, I'm starving.

27:25.975 --> 27:28.500
Well, don't get too excited.
It's just wieners.

27:28.611 --> 27:31.102
Not just wieners.
Wieners and beans.

27:31.214 --> 27:32.408
And for dessert

27:32.515 --> 27:34.642
we're having whipped cream
straight out of the can.

27:34.750 --> 27:35.842
How cool is that?

27:37.787 --> 27:39.812
Ashley's idea.

27:42.225 --> 27:43.749
Now, don't ruin your dinner.

27:43.860 --> 27:44.918
I don't care.

27:45.027 --> 27:46.654
I've emancipated myself
from my mother,

27:46.762 --> 27:48.627
and I can do what I want...
right, Amy?

27:48.731 --> 27:50.062
Yeah, I guess.

27:50.199 --> 27:51.063
Well, at least share.

27:51.167 --> 27:52.828
- Heads up.
- Yeah.

27:54.437 --> 27:57.099
That's pretty good stuff.
You want some, Amy?

27:57.206 --> 27:58.730
No, I should probably get going.

27:58.841 --> 28:00.274
You just got here.

28:02.478 --> 28:05.572
Hey, what's the matter?

28:05.681 --> 28:07.342
I don't know.
I should just probably go.

28:07.450 --> 28:10.578
You might as well get back
to your little party there.

28:10.686 --> 28:13.211
Maybe later you and Ashley
can have whipped-cream fights.

28:13.322 --> 28:16.416
I thought we talked about this.
You said you trusted me.

28:17.160 --> 28:19.993
I thought I did, too, Caleb.

28:26.469 --> 28:29.563
I don't get why people
go crazy over horses.

28:29.672 --> 28:32.607
They just seem like
big poo machines to me.

28:32.708 --> 28:34.676
Well, they're really smart.

28:34.844 --> 28:36.334
And you can tell them secrets

28:36.445 --> 28:38.413
because they're pretty much
guaranteed

28:38.514 --> 28:39.913
that they won't tell anyone.

28:40.016 --> 28:41.540
Kind of like a horse therapist?

28:44.020 --> 28:45.851
Okay, Copper.

28:45.955 --> 28:49.413
Here I come.
So, you better not slobber on me.

28:51.727 --> 28:52.853
I can't do it.

28:52.962 --> 28:54.361
He's gonna eat my arm off.
I know it.

28:54.463 --> 28:56.294
Okay, he won't hurt you.
I promise.

28:58.467 --> 29:00.526
Badger, what are you doing?

29:05.441 --> 29:07.807
Oh, my God! He's eating it!

29:07.910 --> 29:09.104
Are you seeing this?

29:09.212 --> 29:11.203
Yeah, I think he likes you.

29:25.728 --> 29:28.390
That is about as much math
as I can stand on a Saturday night.

29:28.497 --> 29:30.829
Sorry.

29:31.467 --> 29:32.832
It's just no matter how hard I study,

29:32.935 --> 29:34.926
I always feel like I'm playing
catch-up to everyone else.

29:36.539 --> 29:37.801
You know, in all this time

29:37.907 --> 29:40.102
that I've been helping you
with your homework,

29:40.209 --> 29:42.643
you've never told me
why you didn't finish high school.

29:42.745 --> 29:44.372
I just wasn't a very good student.

29:45.581 --> 29:46.878
I find that hard to believe.

29:48.017 --> 29:50.417
You've been getting straight A's
on everything we've done so far.

29:51.187 --> 29:54.315
Well, maybe if I had a hot tutor
like you back in the day,

29:54.423 --> 29:55.685
I'd have made the honor roll.

29:59.262 --> 30:02.026
So, who was that guy
that we saw this morning?

30:02.131 --> 30:04.065
You know, the wrestler?

30:04.734 --> 30:06.497
It's nobody.

30:06.602 --> 30:09.093
Hey, how about some dessert, huh?

30:09.205 --> 30:10.536
Here. You pick.

30:16.145 --> 30:17.703
You know what I like best
about math?

30:18.914 --> 30:22.042
It's that if I work at it hard enough,
I always find the answer.

30:23.586 --> 30:25.679
But with you, Ty Borden,

30:25.788 --> 30:28.256
no matter what I do, I always end up
with more questions.

30:36.265 --> 30:38.062
Dibs on the bed.

30:38.167 --> 30:40.397
Okay. Guess I'll just sleep
on the floor, then.

30:40.569 --> 30:42.662
Hey! Dibs on the bed.

30:42.772 --> 30:46.071
Nuh-uh. I called it.
You'll have to fight me for it.

30:46.175 --> 30:48.075
Mallory, what are you doing here?

30:48.177 --> 30:50.407
Lou said I could sleep over.

30:52.882 --> 30:55.908
Okay, this night just keeps getting
better and better.

30:56.786 --> 30:58.720
I will suffocate you.

31:04.293 --> 31:05.521
Hey.

31:05.628 --> 31:07.289
Hey.

31:07.396 --> 31:11.025
Any room here
for a slumber-party reject?

31:11.133 --> 31:13.431
Yeah, sure.

31:14.503 --> 31:15.561
Where's Badger?

31:15.738 --> 31:17.535
He's sleeping.

31:17.640 --> 31:20.438
You're not such a bad
camp counselor after all.

31:22.578 --> 31:24.910
Yeah, right.

31:25.014 --> 31:28.381
Are you gonna tell me
what's been going on with you?

31:28.484 --> 31:30.179
It's nothing, Amy.

31:30.286 --> 31:31.844
Ty.

31:33.389 --> 31:35.414
It's just...

31:36.092 --> 31:38.890
Clint brought those kids here
thinking I'm some kind of poster boy.

31:38.994 --> 31:40.393
And I'm not.

31:40.830 --> 31:44.789
Maybe he's just proud of you.
There's nothing wrong with that.

31:47.036 --> 31:49.266
You don't understand, Amy.

31:49.372 --> 31:50.930
I want to, Ty.

31:54.910 --> 31:56.507
All right.

31:56.610 --> 31:59.707
When I was
a bit younger than Badger,

32:00.116 --> 32:02.880
my mom married this new guy.

32:02.985 --> 32:05.715
And he was...

32:06.856 --> 32:10.087
Let's just say that he made
my real dad look like a saint.

32:11.460 --> 32:14.395
And I promised myself
that when I got older,

32:14.497 --> 32:17.398
I'd pay him back for everything.

32:17.500 --> 32:19.024
And I did.

32:21.604 --> 32:22.935
Probably would have killed him

32:23.004 --> 32:24.935
if the neighbors
hadn't called the cops.

32:28.978 --> 32:31.913
And then that's when I met Clint.

32:32.815 --> 32:34.305
Everybody at the group home
used to say

32:34.417 --> 32:36.817
you don't meet Clint unless
they really think you're hopeless.

32:36.919 --> 32:39.410
Well, they were wrong,
weren't they?

32:40.856 --> 32:43.723
I'm not so sure about that.

32:45.428 --> 32:48.522
I don't regret what I did, Amy.

32:48.631 --> 32:51.031
I'd do it again if I had to.

32:57.907 --> 32:59.499
Hey!

32:59.608 --> 33:01.098
You should go.

33:02.411 --> 33:04.140
You don't have to say anything, Amy.

33:05.281 --> 33:06.213
Ty.

33:06.348 --> 33:06.939
Ow.

33:08.083 --> 33:09.277
Go.

33:09.385 --> 33:12.821
Before they completely destroy
the cabin.

33:13.656 --> 33:16.557
You know, for what it's worth, I...

33:16.659 --> 33:19.992
I'm really glad
that Clint brought you here.

33:23.659 --> 33:24.992
Good night.

34:19.655 --> 34:24.092
I've never seen anything so beautiful
in my entire life.

34:24.193 --> 34:27.389
Except maybe Ty Borden.

34:28.163 --> 34:29.391
I kissed him once.

34:29.498 --> 34:31.966
Shut up!
You and Ty macked out?

34:32.067 --> 34:34.092
Well, it was kind of impulsive.

34:34.203 --> 34:37.331
And he didn't really kiss back.
So, it didn't really count.

34:37.438 --> 34:38.735
Oh, it counts.

34:38.841 --> 34:41.605
You are, like, my new hero.

34:41.710 --> 34:43.974
You must have some serious mojo.

34:44.079 --> 34:46.877
Mallory mojo.

34:46.982 --> 34:48.574
What about you and Badger?

34:48.684 --> 34:51.551
I like Badger.

34:51.654 --> 34:54.248
I don't know.
It's hard to know where he's at.

34:55.190 --> 35:01.322
He, like, never talks,
and he's just so... damaged.

35:02.398 --> 35:05.492
I don't know.
Sometimes he scares me.

35:05.601 --> 35:08.570
But anyway, I want to hear
all about your kiss with Ty,

35:08.671 --> 35:11.003
starting from what you had
for breakfast that morning.

35:11.106 --> 35:13.233
Oh, my God.

35:17.279 --> 35:20.146
Badger!

35:20.950 --> 35:22.713
Badger!

35:24.086 --> 35:26.020
Badger!

35:26.121 --> 35:27.247
Ty, what is it?

35:27.389 --> 35:28.481
Badger took off.

35:28.591 --> 35:30.456
He probably went out
for a smoke.

35:30.559 --> 35:31.821
No, I checked everywhere.

35:31.927 --> 35:33.326
And one of the horses
is missing, too.

35:33.429 --> 35:35.158
Mallory, take Tara inside, okay?

35:35.264 --> 35:36.128
Screw that.

35:36.231 --> 35:37.596
Hey, do you want us
to find him or not?

35:37.700 --> 35:39.691
Come on.

35:39.802 --> 35:41.326
Let's split up.
You take Big River trail.

35:41.437 --> 35:43.632
I'll go down by Briar Ridge.

36:05.193 --> 36:07.286
Badger!

36:12.567 --> 36:14.432
Badger!

36:14.536 --> 36:17.369
You all right? Come on.

36:18.139 --> 36:19.538
Let's get you out of there.

36:20.609 --> 36:21.667
You okay?

36:21.776 --> 36:23.641
Come on.
Let's get you warmed up here.

36:24.980 --> 36:26.140
Let's get you warmed up.

36:28.583 --> 36:29.675
Come on!

36:31.553 --> 36:33.487
You don't want my jacket?
Fine!

36:33.588 --> 36:35.021
If you want to die down here,
I don't care.

36:35.123 --> 36:38.524
But you putting that horse in danger,
that was a really stupid thing to do.

36:38.627 --> 36:42.119
Leave me alone.

36:43.431 --> 36:46.332
Wow. You actually do talk.

36:47.836 --> 36:49.963
I don't want your help.

36:50.071 --> 36:52.471
So, that's it?

36:52.574 --> 36:56.010
You're done? Giving up?

36:56.111 --> 36:58.079
Something like that.

36:59.381 --> 37:01.747
Well, that's crap.

37:02.183 --> 37:04.310
Clint gave you a chance
when you got here.

37:04.419 --> 37:05.852
And you just blew it.

37:05.954 --> 37:08.514
You probably just bought yourself
a one-way ticket to a locked unit.

37:09.357 --> 37:11.188
Who cares?

37:11.293 --> 37:12.624
I bet Tara does.

37:12.727 --> 37:15.252
No, she doesn't.

37:15.664 --> 37:17.825
She just thinks I'm a freak.

37:17.966 --> 37:21.424
Oh, gee, I wonder why that is.

37:21.736 --> 37:23.135
This whole not-talking thing.

37:23.238 --> 37:25.035
I don't know a lot of girls
that are into that.

37:27.876 --> 37:30.640
It's too late.

37:31.746 --> 37:33.805
No, it's not.

37:35.317 --> 37:38.081
Trust me, I know.

37:39.154 --> 37:41.622
Come on.
Let's get you out of here.

37:41.723 --> 37:43.418
One, two, three.

37:46.661 --> 37:50.688
He went out for a smoke,
and he must have gotten lost.

37:50.799 --> 37:52.232
It happens sometimes.

37:52.334 --> 37:54.529
The bush is awful thick
in that part of the ranch.

37:57.305 --> 38:00.433
And he took a bit of a spill
on his way back, but he's okay now.

38:01.643 --> 38:04.874
Right. Well, I'll put that
in my report.

38:04.979 --> 38:08.540
Glad to hear that for the most part
the kids were well-behaved.

38:08.650 --> 38:10.584
Judging from the success
of the weekend,

38:10.685 --> 38:12.846
I'll definitely be bringing
more kids out here

38:12.954 --> 38:14.785
to the dude ranch in the future.

38:14.889 --> 38:16.550
Anytime, Clint.

38:17.292 --> 38:18.281
Anytime.

38:19.794 --> 38:21.887
Duly noted.

38:26.534 --> 38:28.297
Are you sure about this?

38:28.403 --> 38:30.394
Of course I'm sure.

38:30.505 --> 38:33.736
You're gonna look so badass.

38:33.842 --> 38:35.036
Go like this.

38:36.945 --> 38:40.574
Your parents are gonna totally freak
when they see you.

38:40.682 --> 38:42.172
All right.
But remember our deal.

38:42.283 --> 38:43.875
If I do this,
you have to ride Copper.

38:45.787 --> 38:48.153
I'm a woman of my word.

38:55.130 --> 38:56.688
Oh.

38:56.798 --> 38:58.527
Peter, huh? Another gift.

38:58.633 --> 39:00.294
Internet boy's got it bad for you.

39:00.402 --> 39:01.334
Amy, give it back.

39:01.503 --> 39:03.994
No. Not until you tell me
what's going on.

39:04.105 --> 39:05.902
I mean, how was your date?
What did he look like?

39:06.007 --> 39:08.305
Well, he was...

39:08.410 --> 39:10.378
He was very...

39:11.179 --> 39:13.409
- Goth?
- What? Really.

39:13.515 --> 39:15.142
No, not Peter.

39:15.250 --> 39:17.912
You got to see this.

39:23.691 --> 39:25.318
What are you looking at?

39:25.427 --> 39:26.451
Nothing.

39:26.561 --> 39:29.826
I'm just glad to see
the riding lessons are going well.

39:29.931 --> 39:30.955
Whatever.

39:38.239 --> 39:41.231
I think it might just be a phase.

39:46.014 --> 39:48.915
Hey. What'd I tell you
about smoking?

39:53.121 --> 39:54.383
Hey, Ty.

39:56.390 --> 39:58.882
Thanks for not telling on me.
Twice.

40:02.464 --> 40:03.488
Don't worry about it.

40:06.598 --> 40:08.558
I'm gonna try talking to Tara.

40:09.137 --> 40:10.468
Yeah?

40:10.572 --> 40:13.666
That's a pretty brave move.
You sure you're up for that?

40:16.578 --> 40:17.943
No.

40:18.046 --> 40:21.880
But I guess I'm gonna do it anyway.

40:23.685 --> 40:26.415
Before it really is too late.

40:43.137 --> 40:45.230
What's going on?

40:56.484 --> 40:59.078
Ashley? What are you doing here?

40:59.587 --> 41:02.020
Jack called me.

41:02.123 --> 41:04.956
Why didn't you say anything?

41:12.233 --> 41:13.767
Honey, it's just some tests.

41:14.068 --> 41:17.162
Whatever this is, Mom,
I'm not gonna let you do it alone.

41:17.272 --> 41:20.241
Look, just get in the car.

41:20.341 --> 41:22.935
Don't argue with me.

41:23.044 --> 41:24.739
I don't want to fight anymore.

41:27.215 --> 41:28.807
Okay.

41:28.917 --> 41:31.852
But just give me a sec, all right?

41:39.861 --> 41:43.456
I know it wasn't my place, but...

42:06.988 --> 42:07.784
Hey.

42:08.990 --> 42:11.686
Spillproof mug.
World's a safer place.

42:11.793 --> 42:13.420
Yeah. It keeps my coffee warm, too.

42:13.528 --> 42:14.620
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

42:14.729 --> 42:17.857
Better gift than flowers, right?

42:18.166 --> 42:21.101
What am I doing here?

42:21.603 --> 42:23.764
I don't even know you.

42:23.871 --> 42:25.236
Well, here's what we're gonna do.

42:25.340 --> 42:26.773
We gonna have
an actual conversation.

42:26.874 --> 42:28.136
No instant messaging.

42:28.242 --> 42:30.437
No spontaneous make-out sessions.

42:30.545 --> 42:32.479
Just two people talking.

42:32.580 --> 42:33.911
Right? What do you think?

42:35.416 --> 42:37.611
I think that I can handle that.

42:37.719 --> 42:40.119
There we go.

42:40.321 --> 42:41.515
Great.

42:41.623 --> 42:43.716
Okay.

42:43.958 --> 42:46.722
That's not to say that spontaneous
making out couldn't happen later.

42:46.828 --> 42:48.557
- You know, I'm just...
- Don't push it.

42:48.663 --> 42:49.960
Okay.

42:58.506 --> 43:00.997
Hey, what's the matter?

43:01.109 --> 43:03.441
It's my mother.

43:03.811 --> 43:06.211
I just took her to the clinic.

43:07.815 --> 43:09.749
What if she's really sick?

43:11.252 --> 43:13.152
I don't have anyone else.

43:13.254 --> 43:14.016
Hey.

43:15.289 --> 43:17.553
You got me.

43:23.398 --> 43:25.696
Aha, so this is where
you've been hiding.

43:25.800 --> 43:26.960
Shh.

43:27.068 --> 43:28.865
Check it out.

43:32.940 --> 43:36.398
Wow. Badger's actually talking.

43:42.083 --> 43:43.516
What do you think they're saying?

43:44.083 --> 43:45.516
I don't know.

43:48.256 --> 43:50.451
Whatever he's saying, it worked.

43:55.830 --> 43:57.764
Ty, um...

43:57.865 --> 44:01.858
You know those things you said
last night about your stepdad?

44:03.071 --> 44:04.936
Why didn't you ever tell me?

44:07.075 --> 44:10.567
I never told anyone
that stuff before.

44:17.675 --> 44:19.567
Hey you two,
get a room!
