00:12.560 --> 00:13.520
Where is Max?

00:13.550 --> 00:15.190
I want to start
the meeting.

00:15.220 --> 00:18.280
My money's on
"stuck in a well."

00:18.310 --> 00:20.440
Why would Max
be stuck in a well?

00:20.480 --> 00:22.010
Because I put
a well in his room.

00:25.210 --> 00:26.540
Guys, so sorry I'm late.

00:26.570 --> 00:29.140
I got stuck in a well.

00:31.010 --> 00:33.040
And thank you to Alex,
I don't have to leave my room

00:33.070 --> 00:34.800
to get a drink
of water anymore.

00:36.740 --> 00:40.540
Alex, go up to your brother's
room and get rid of that well.

00:40.570 --> 00:43.030
But save the water, 'cause
we need to make ice cubes.

00:43.070 --> 00:48.030
OK. I'll save the wood, too,
so you can turn it into pulp
and make napkins.

00:48.070 --> 00:50.470
Hey...
that is a great idea.

00:50.500 --> 00:51.700
You get on that!

00:53.070 --> 00:56.170
OK, tomorrow is
your mother's birthday.

00:56.200 --> 00:59.030
Oh, do you guys give
her magical gifts?

00:59.070 --> 01:01.530
You know Mom and magic.
Not a fan.

01:01.570 --> 01:05.140
Great. I can give her
my "I hate magic" t-shirt.

01:10.740 --> 01:11.940
Yeah, she'd probably like that.

01:12.010 --> 01:13.770
There's this whole shelf
of magical gifts

01:13.810 --> 01:16.040
Uncle Kelbo gave her and
she never even opened 'em.

01:16.080 --> 01:17.510
Let me guess,
Alex opened them?

01:17.550 --> 01:18.610
Kuh-ah-ah!

01:20.180 --> 01:22.270
Alex does not
know about this shelf.

01:22.310 --> 01:23.910
She thinks they're
educational toys.

01:23.940 --> 01:26.170
And you are not gonna be
the one to tell her about it.

01:26.210 --> 01:28.940
Don't worry.
I won't say anything.

01:28.980 --> 01:32.040
Look, we don't have to worry
about Kelbo's gift this year,

01:32.080 --> 01:33.540
because he's not
coming to dinner.

01:33.580 --> 01:35.140
Uncle Kelbo's not
coming to dinner?

01:35.180 --> 01:36.810
That's my gift to Mom.
I call it.

02:34.680 --> 02:38.480
Hey, Mom, here's a
little pre-birthday present.

02:38.520 --> 02:40.580
Uncle Kelbo's not coming
to your birthday dinner.

02:40.620 --> 02:43.120
Pretty good, huh? It's just
gonna be the six of us.

02:45.150 --> 02:48.520
That's great, honey. It'll be
just like every other dinner,
right?

02:48.550 --> 02:50.050
Do I get to cook it, too?

02:50.090 --> 02:53.320
No, it's your birthday.
It should be special.

02:53.360 --> 02:55.160
Why don't we invite over
all of your cousins?

02:55.190 --> 02:57.230
They live so close
but we never get to see them.

02:57.260 --> 03:00.560
No, no, no. No one from my
side of the family is visiting.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.730
Can we at least
invite Uncle Ernesto?

03:02.760 --> 03:07.000
Yeah, come on. He always has
awesome stories about his
travels all over the world.

03:07.030 --> 03:08.770
His stories aren't that great.

03:08.800 --> 03:11.030
I've got stories
from my travels.

03:11.070 --> 03:13.540
Remember the time I almost
hit the rat on the Brooklyn
Bridge?

03:13.570 --> 03:16.470
I was like... whoa!

03:20.270 --> 03:23.610
I'll never forget that time
Uncle Ernesto took me to that
Mets game.

03:23.640 --> 03:26.340
He caught a foul ball
and gave it to me.

03:26.380 --> 03:27.910
That was like, ten years ago.

03:27.950 --> 03:30.550
How about you get another story
about some grown-up that likes
you.

03:32.250 --> 03:34.080
Ten years, Theresa.

03:34.120 --> 03:37.750
I think they're old enough
to understand now.

03:37.790 --> 03:40.650
Yeah, Mom, come on.
What is it?

03:40.690 --> 03:42.690
Are you embarrassed of us?

03:45.560 --> 03:48.330
If anyone needs me, I'll be
upstairs spearing things.

03:50.100 --> 03:54.000
No, honey, I've numbed out
"embarrassed" long, long ago.

03:55.470 --> 03:56.970
Then what is it, Mom?
We used to have so much fun

03:57.000 --> 03:57.970
with Uncle Ernesto.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.700
Yeah. That was before
your powers came in.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.870
Remember the next time
he took you to a Mets game?

04:02.900 --> 04:05.710
You guys used magic to make
every foul ball come straight
to you.

04:05.740 --> 04:09.680
- Oh, yeah.
- After that, I can't risk
him finding out about magic.

04:09.710 --> 04:13.210
Well... So, what, you're
just gonna ignore your brother
forever?

04:13.250 --> 04:14.980
That actually sounds
like a good idea.

04:16.380 --> 04:19.579
I've thought about having
Ernesto over so many times

04:19.620 --> 04:23.390
but you guys are way too
careless with wizardry.

04:23.420 --> 04:26.720
Well...

04:26.760 --> 04:28.860
What if we promised that
if Uncle Ernesto came over,

04:28.890 --> 04:31.230
it would be
a magic-free evening?

04:31.260 --> 04:33.530
I would love
to have Ernesto over,

04:33.560 --> 04:37.070
but you guys can't go ten
minutes without using magic.

04:37.100 --> 04:40.070
Mom, I've been holding
back using magic all day.

04:40.100 --> 04:44.140
You don't think I want to
turn Justin's ugly shirt
into something uglier?

04:44.170 --> 04:47.340
You don't think I want to
put a zipper on Alex's face?

04:48.940 --> 04:50.810
- If you promise...
- We promise.

04:50.840 --> 04:52.950
- Promise.
- Promise, promise.

04:52.980 --> 04:55.450
Then I guess we can
have Ernesto over.

04:55.480 --> 04:58.080
Yay for family.

05:05.890 --> 05:09.890
Oh, Harper, you don't have to go
to such extremes for my birthday
cake.

05:09.930 --> 05:12.560
I'd be just as happy
with a candle in a cupcake.

05:12.600 --> 05:15.060
Well, let her
make the cake, honey.

05:15.100 --> 05:16.730
Ooh, that would be good.

05:16.770 --> 05:19.030
Harper, can you
make a honey cake?

05:19.070 --> 05:20.570
I can put in whatever you want.

05:20.600 --> 05:23.640
Making a birthday cake from
scratch is a Finkle family
tradition.

05:24.740 --> 05:26.980
All right.
Wands are in the Lair.

05:27.010 --> 05:29.850
The well is gone.
We are in a magic-free zone.

05:29.880 --> 05:32.280
- Happy birthday, Mom.
- Thank you, <i>mija.</i>

05:32.310 --> 05:35.380
This is gonna be
the best birthday ever.

05:35.420 --> 05:37.080
Oh, I hope I didn't
just jinx it.

05:37.120 --> 05:40.020
Oh, that's Uncle Ernesto.

05:40.060 --> 05:43.190
OK, whatever you guys do,
do not use magic.

05:43.220 --> 05:45.660
Yes, Justin, why don't
you say it louder?

05:47.530 --> 05:50.030
- Hey!
- Hey!

05:50.060 --> 05:53.470
How you doing? Nice to see you.
What's up, man?

05:53.500 --> 05:56.670
- Hey, Theresa!
- Ernesto!

05:56.700 --> 06:00.070
- Oh, you look great.
- I know!

06:01.340 --> 06:03.370
And you still look
like you're 27 years old.

06:03.410 --> 06:05.540
I know!

06:05.580 --> 06:07.040
You haven't changed, have you?

06:07.080 --> 06:10.150
Has she told you how wildly
popular she was in high school?

06:10.180 --> 06:12.980
Today? Not yet.

06:13.020 --> 06:15.620
Well, I was wildly popular, too.

06:15.650 --> 06:18.490
But am I the only one here?
Where's the rest of the family?

06:18.520 --> 06:23.520
Oh, well, I got so excited
when I invited you and you
said you'd come

06:23.560 --> 06:25.890
that I forgot to
invite anybody else.

06:25.930 --> 06:29.300
- Jerry?
- Um...

06:29.330 --> 06:31.930
Long time, no see, Ernesto.
How've you been?

06:31.970 --> 06:33.730
Oh, terrific.
I've been terrific, actually.

06:33.770 --> 06:35.900
I just came back from
a trip down to Mexico,

06:35.940 --> 06:41.610
and while I was there,
I helped rescue
the President of Mexico's cat.

06:42.910 --> 06:46.640
So... they gave me
the key to the country!

06:47.250 --> 06:48.650
Wow!

06:48.680 --> 06:50.680
Now we can get into Mexico,

06:50.720 --> 06:52.620
even after it's closed,
and on the weekends.

06:53.820 --> 06:56.590
All right. I was
just kidding about the key.

06:56.620 --> 07:00.660
But I did save the President
of Mexico's cat, and in return,
he gave me a job.

07:00.690 --> 07:03.460
Head of security.
For the cat.

07:05.660 --> 07:08.660
Oh, so that would
make you a catsitter?

07:10.200 --> 07:12.300
Alex...

07:12.330 --> 07:13.670
You look wonderful.

07:13.700 --> 07:15.400
You look like
a grown up young lady.

07:15.440 --> 07:17.800
Aw. See, everybody?

07:17.840 --> 07:21.240
It's possible to say
that without being sarcastic.

07:22.540 --> 07:23.710
And, Justin! Look at you, man.

07:23.740 --> 07:25.810
Pretty soon, you're gonna
be taller than me.

07:28.710 --> 07:32.010
I already am taller
than you, Uncle Ernesto.

07:32.050 --> 07:35.980
Well, if your mother's 27,
then I'm taller than you.

07:37.220 --> 07:38.920
Now, I know it's
your mother's birthday

07:38.950 --> 07:41.590
but I still got you guys
a little something-something.

07:41.620 --> 07:43.890
Aw, thank you.
That's so sweet of you.

07:43.920 --> 07:46.860
Hi. Hello. I'm Harper.

07:46.890 --> 07:50.530
I live with the Russos.
Where's my little
something-something?

07:50.560 --> 07:52.830
Oh... Harper, nice to meet you.

07:52.870 --> 07:57.670
I'm sorry. If I knew you were
here, I would've brought you
chocolate fudge or something.

07:57.700 --> 07:59.870
Oh. No worries.

07:59.900 --> 08:04.210
Being forgotten is like an old,
comfortable pair of shoes.

08:04.240 --> 08:07.510
Well, how about a giant
novelty key that I bought
in Times Square?

08:07.540 --> 08:11.080
Ah! This is fine for now,
but now that you know I exist,

08:11.110 --> 08:13.250
I expect something
better next time.

08:14.550 --> 08:17.820
OK. Why don't we all
just sit down, relax,

08:17.850 --> 08:20.320
and Alex and Justin
can open up their gifts.

08:20.360 --> 08:22.360
You guys are
gonna love it.

08:22.390 --> 08:25.660
It is a classic Latin American
game called <i>Balero.</i>

08:25.690 --> 08:29.760
Ah. And if I'm not mistaken,
<i>Balero</i> is Spanish

08:29.800 --> 08:33.000
for "something really
cool and expensive."

08:35.970 --> 08:38.270
And I'm mistaken.

08:38.299 --> 08:43.010
And for Theresa, I got our home
movies transferred to a DVD...

08:43.039 --> 08:48.080
- ...and our most precious
memories in a scrapbook.

08:48.110 --> 08:52.380
Oh, Ernesto. It's wonderful.

08:53.280 --> 08:54.550
Hey...

08:54.590 --> 08:56.450
- Uncle Ernesto!
- Max.

08:56.490 --> 08:57.890
Hey, I got you a gift.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.920
It's those shoes you wanted
when you were little,

08:59.960 --> 09:01.390
the ones with the
springs on the bottom.

09:01.420 --> 09:04.760
Remember how you said you
wanted to jump to the moon?

09:05.430 --> 09:06.900
Wow, thank you.

09:06.930 --> 09:09.230
But, I don't really need those.
I've been to Mars.

09:09.270 --> 09:11.030
- To Mars?
- Uh...

09:11.070 --> 09:15.400
What he means to say is he's
been to a Mars-themed restaurant
in mid-town.

09:15.440 --> 09:20.540
Yep. It's called T.J.I.,
you know... Mars.

09:20.570 --> 09:22.740
Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry.
I was just distracted by
this gift

09:22.780 --> 09:24.280
that came for Mom
from Uncle Kelbo.

09:24.310 --> 09:29.210
- Open it, Mom.
- Max, why don't you
get that out of here?

09:29.250 --> 09:30.980
All right. I'll take it
down to the Lair.

09:32.980 --> 09:34.720
Um... Lair?

09:34.750 --> 09:36.290
Uh... He means fort.
We have a fort.

09:36.320 --> 09:37.690
We built a fort.

09:38.990 --> 09:41.290
Can someone go down and make
sure that Kelbo's gift

09:41.320 --> 09:43.790
- gets into the fort?
- I'll go.

09:43.830 --> 09:46.190
- I meant you.
- Yeah, you got it.

09:46.230 --> 09:48.990
I'm just gonna go to the fort.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.770
A fort sounds like fun, man.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.700
I built a fort
once in the woods.

09:54.740 --> 09:57.700
Yeah, it was so amazing that
the park rangers turned it into
a gift shop

09:57.740 --> 10:00.010
where they sold mini
versions of that fort.

10:01.510 --> 10:06.180
Well, I've slept outside
on our terrace.

10:06.210 --> 10:08.410
In the rain.

10:08.450 --> 10:09.920
Why would you do that?

10:11.420 --> 10:15.720
In case I ran into someone
with a story like that,
so I could top it.

10:15.760 --> 10:17.390
Topped.

10:19.060 --> 10:21.260
All right, well,
let's go check out this fort.

10:21.300 --> 10:24.700
No, no! We can't,
because we have to...

10:24.730 --> 10:27.200
...move the furniture
like Theresa's always wanted.

10:27.230 --> 10:30.700
- Happy birthday, honey.
- Oh, thank you! It's what I've
always wanted.

10:30.740 --> 10:32.440
Uh... Ernesto,
could you give me a hand?

10:32.470 --> 10:34.640
Yes, I can give you a hand.

10:34.680 --> 10:36.980
Yeah, Jerry!
Go, do it!

10:37.010 --> 10:38.710
You can move it!

10:40.280 --> 10:41.810
Just kidding.
Topped.

10:49.590 --> 10:54.490
Max! Max, we are trying to give
Mom a magic-free birthday.

10:54.530 --> 10:57.060
Don't bring any of Uncle Kelbo's
crazy magic gift upstairs.

10:57.100 --> 10:59.800
Fine, I'll put it on
the shelf with the others.

11:01.270 --> 11:02.700
Others?

11:04.300 --> 11:08.140
Did you just say that shelf
is full of crazy magic gifts?

11:08.170 --> 11:11.940
Um, no. You said crazy magic
gifts. I just said shelf.

11:11.980 --> 11:15.380
I can't believe it.
I never touched those!

11:15.410 --> 11:18.080
Dad told me those
were educational toys. Max...

11:18.110 --> 11:21.220
You knew about this and you
didn't open up the gifts?

11:21.250 --> 11:23.750
When I first heard about
the shelf I was too short
to reach it,

11:23.790 --> 11:25.490
so, naturally,
I forgot about it.

11:25.520 --> 11:27.820
I'm trying to forget
about stuff I can't reach.

11:27.860 --> 11:30.590
Leaves more room up here
for important stuff.

11:30.630 --> 11:35.060
Oh, look. "Party in a Box."

11:35.100 --> 11:38.060
Open the lid and turn any room
into an instant party.

11:38.100 --> 11:41.170
Well, I am dying to do that.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.400
What are you guys doing?

11:44.000 --> 11:45.670
- You showed her the shelf,
didn't ya?
- Yup.

11:47.210 --> 11:49.610
Forget about this, Alex.
We're supposed to be upstairs

11:49.640 --> 11:51.580
having nothing to do with magic
and that's where we're going.

11:51.610 --> 11:55.410
Yeah, but there's a whole
shelf of crazy magic gifts
nobody ever told me about.

11:55.450 --> 11:57.280
And, ooh...

11:57.320 --> 11:59.580
Look at this one.

11:59.620 --> 12:03.790
This one sounds like
it's a time-traveling
pocket watch.

12:03.820 --> 12:07.120
- You know you want it.
- No, I do not want it.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.220
Why would I want that? We're not
supposed to be using magic

12:09.260 --> 12:13.060
- so let's go. Come on!
- Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

12:13.100 --> 12:16.660
Alex, that's not even how you do
it. Give it here. I'll show you.

12:18.200 --> 12:23.140
Oooh. It's a magic
Swiss Shoulder Bag.

12:23.170 --> 12:24.840
It has everything in it
you need to survive.

12:24.870 --> 12:26.740
Just like a wizard
Swiss Army Knife.

12:26.770 --> 12:29.340
Including...
a mini-magic wand.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.480
It's just a toothpick.

12:37.650 --> 12:40.780
- All right. We're opening
presents. Love it!
- Yes!

12:40.820 --> 12:42.390
Here we go.

12:44.220 --> 12:45.650
- Perfect.
- What?

12:45.690 --> 12:48.020
It will complete my collection.

12:49.490 --> 12:54.230
- Of what?
- Of things I have no idea what
they are.

12:54.260 --> 12:56.960
Max, it's a toy chicken
in a box.

13:08.940 --> 13:11.940
"Fu-chicken." A chicken
that tells the future.

13:11.980 --> 13:16.850
Ask it a question about the
future and when it lays its
egg, the answer is inside.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.480
Really? I'm gonna ask it if
I'll ever be able to pull off
skinny jeans.

13:19.520 --> 13:21.480
Look, I'll answer that. No.

13:21.520 --> 13:26.920
OK... Which one of us will
win the wizard competition?

13:26.950 --> 13:29.960
I need to know if all this
"studying" is paying off.

13:32.860 --> 13:36.660
Nicely done. Now we have to wait
for it to lay the answer egg.

13:36.700 --> 13:39.730
You kidding me?
I don't have that kind of time.

13:39.770 --> 13:43.770
Maybe I can squeeze it
out of him.

13:43.800 --> 13:45.970
Here, wait! Wait!

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Get the chicken!

13:49.340 --> 13:51.670
Look! Look at this.

13:55.010 --> 13:56.810
Uh... huh.

13:56.850 --> 13:59.310
Please note:
Scaring the Fu-chicken

13:59.350 --> 14:03.020
will cause it to lay
various breakfasts,
delaying the answer egg.

14:03.050 --> 14:07.520
We need to go get that chicken
before it lays magic waffles
in front of Uncle Ernesto.

14:09.320 --> 14:10.960
How did it lay the plate?

14:22.660 --> 14:25.960
Whoa! Did the magic chicken
move all the furniture around?

14:26.000 --> 14:27.800
- What?
- Uh...

14:27.830 --> 14:30.400
Max calls Dad
"Magic Chicken."

14:30.440 --> 14:36.770
Oh, uh, right. And I call him
"Boy Who Should Stop Talking."

14:37.670 --> 14:39.210
What's going on?

14:39.240 --> 14:41.110
There's gifts from Uncle Kelbo
we weren't supposed to open,

14:41.140 --> 14:43.440
but we did, Mom hates magic,
there's a magic chicken,

14:43.480 --> 14:46.180
if you see waffles,
don't ask where they came from,
just enjoy them.

14:46.210 --> 14:48.250
Wait, people are eating
waffles? I made cake.

14:52.020 --> 14:54.790
Aw. Look at you guys, picking up
right where you left off.

14:54.820 --> 14:59.590
- Happy birthday, Mom.
- It was all Alex's idea,
you know, inviting you.

14:59.620 --> 15:01.990
Uh... Now, now. Come on.

15:02.030 --> 15:05.330
I'm not one to take
credit... or blame.

15:05.360 --> 15:08.760
Let's just say that this
was everybody's idea, OK?

15:08.800 --> 15:10.570
You'll want to remember
that for later.

15:12.030 --> 15:14.800
Hey! Magic chicken!

15:14.840 --> 15:16.570
Hey, Jerry,
your son's calling you.

15:16.600 --> 15:19.510
What? Oh, right.

15:19.540 --> 15:21.840
We do love our
nicknames in this family.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.510
Don't we,
"What Should We Do Now?"

15:24.550 --> 15:27.050
Yep. That's my nickname.

15:27.080 --> 15:30.880
My nickname is: "I'm Sorry, Mom,
and Remember I'm the Good One,
Usually the Victim."

15:31.920 --> 15:33.550
That's kind of long,
isn't it?

15:35.320 --> 15:38.920
Hey, let's watch go watch some
home movies in our new living
area,

15:38.960 --> 15:41.390
or as I believe they're
called now the "great room."

15:41.430 --> 15:44.400
Oh, no. No movies. New plan.

15:44.430 --> 15:48.500
We, we act them out. I'll be
Mom, Justin, you're Ernesto.

15:48.540 --> 15:50.940
And you are Grandma Maggie.
Go!

15:53.010 --> 15:56.580
OK... OK.
Um, I'm Grandma Maggie.

15:56.610 --> 15:59.550
Here's the story of my
bicycle tour across America.

16:02.520 --> 16:04.650
Why is there a chicken
on the terrace?

16:04.680 --> 16:07.350
Well, off the record,
the chicken is gonna lay an egg

16:07.390 --> 16:10.090
that's gonna tell us who's gonna
win the wizard competition.

16:10.120 --> 16:12.190
Now, on the record,
I don't... what chicken?

16:13.290 --> 16:14.530
OK, look...

16:14.560 --> 16:16.460
...someone found
a chicken on the street

16:16.500 --> 16:17.930
and then brought it
into the house.

16:17.960 --> 16:21.030
We can explain that. And lots of
people raise their own chickens

16:21.070 --> 16:22.500
so they don't have
to pay for eggs, or...

16:24.600 --> 16:26.270
...or plates of waffles
with fruit salad?!

16:26.310 --> 16:28.880
- We can't explain that!
- OK, I'll get rid of it.

16:28.910 --> 16:31.780
Yes, you will. And, wrap up
the waffles in some foil.

16:31.810 --> 16:33.680
You can just toss
the fruit salad.

16:33.710 --> 16:38.750
- Uh...
- And then I forgot which state
was downhill.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.010
OK, "Boy Who Should
Stop Talking,"

16:42.050 --> 16:44.810
go wash up on the terrace
with "What Should We Do Now"

16:44.850 --> 16:47.010
and "I'm Usually The Victim."

16:48.520 --> 16:50.550
Grab the chicken. Get it!

16:50.580 --> 16:52.220
Get it, Alex!

16:53.590 --> 16:55.260
He still hasn't laid
the answer egg.

16:55.290 --> 16:58.790
Must be waiting right there
in his chicken butt.

16:58.830 --> 17:01.830
OK, I have an idea. Max, why
don't you distract the chicken,

17:01.860 --> 17:05.560
- and I'll catch it in this box.
- But that's Dad's good box.

17:05.599 --> 17:08.400
That's the box he was gonna
use to store his favorite
paper bags.

17:08.430 --> 17:12.069
Justin, we have to do
something to save Mom's
"no-magic birthday."

17:12.099 --> 17:14.240
All right, Max.
Distract the chicken.

17:14.270 --> 17:15.910
Do your "distract the chicken"
dance.

17:15.940 --> 17:17.780
Thought you'd never ask.

17:27.020 --> 17:28.620
- Alex!
- Oh, right. Sorry.

17:28.650 --> 17:31.050
That was so good
you distracted me.

17:32.660 --> 17:34.460
OK, I got it. I got it.

17:34.490 --> 17:36.520
Put it in.

17:36.560 --> 17:39.060
Magic chicken problem solved.

17:39.090 --> 17:42.400
Now, let's get in there and
act like nothing's going on.

17:42.430 --> 17:44.300
Or...

17:44.360 --> 17:48.500
Or Max could stay here and watch
it and wait for it to lay the
answer egg.

17:50.130 --> 17:52.200
All right. Fine.

17:56.240 --> 17:58.200
All right.

17:59.770 --> 18:01.110
Boo!

18:03.750 --> 18:08.080
Ah, my favorite.
Body-temperature oatmeal.

18:09.550 --> 18:14.150
Oh, look at us.
We are so cute!

18:15.820 --> 18:17.660
Look how much fun
they're having.

18:17.690 --> 18:19.360
Aren't you glad we
didn't ruin it for them?

18:19.390 --> 18:20.960
Yep, got it all under control.

18:20.990 --> 18:23.390
It's not like your bag
is glowing or anything.

18:23.430 --> 18:25.390
I know. My bag is glowing.

18:26.560 --> 18:30.630
- OK! I'm here to help!
- Uh...

18:30.660 --> 18:34.930
Um... where did he come from?

18:34.970 --> 18:38.370
- Uh, this is...
- Our superintendant.

18:38.400 --> 18:41.910
He has keys to all the
apartments and lets himself
in whenever he wants.

18:41.940 --> 18:45.510
Yes, Cliff,
thank you for coming.

18:45.540 --> 18:48.180
The toilet is backed up.
Let me show you where it is.

18:49.550 --> 18:50.810
Hey!

18:50.850 --> 18:53.620
Get back here, magic chicken.

18:53.650 --> 18:56.520
I got him! I...

18:56.550 --> 18:59.960
Chicken? I hate chickens.
Get it away from me.

19:03.430 --> 19:05.300
Hello, Cliff.

19:05.330 --> 19:08.570
Yeah, I don't think this
is the kind of birthday party

19:08.600 --> 19:10.200
your mom was
looking for, Alex.

19:10.240 --> 19:13.140
Relax. At least I didn't
open the "Party in a Box."

19:14.400 --> 19:16.140
I...

19:19.770 --> 19:22.170
All right. What's going on?

19:22.210 --> 19:23.510
Where did all that
come from?

19:23.540 --> 19:27.680
It's a surprise
birthday party for me!

19:27.710 --> 19:29.110
Yes, that's exactly what it is.

19:29.150 --> 19:31.520
Everybody, surprise! Surprise.

19:31.550 --> 19:33.250
Surprise!

19:33.280 --> 19:35.750
They are always surprising me.

19:35.790 --> 19:39.260
Everywhere I look,
there's always a surprise.

19:39.290 --> 19:42.990
Alex, why don't you come outside
onto the terrace with me,

19:43.030 --> 19:44.830
so I can thank you
for the surprise.

19:44.860 --> 19:49.400
Oh, no thank you, Mom. Whatever
you need to say, you can say
in front of the witnesses.

19:57.770 --> 19:59.370
What is going on in there?

19:59.410 --> 20:02.210
If you would have told me that
my birthday reunion with Ernesto

20:02.240 --> 20:05.980
was gonna be a three-ring,
dance party, chicken-squawking,
elf circus,

20:06.010 --> 20:09.010
I would've said,
"Uh... no thanks."

20:09.580 --> 20:10.710
I'm sorry, Mom.

20:10.750 --> 20:12.180
I didn't mean for
all this to happen.

20:12.220 --> 20:15.850
You never mean it, do you, Alex?
Yet it always happens.

20:15.890 --> 20:18.590
I should have known better
than to trust you.

20:20.460 --> 20:23.520
Mom, I know how much
you've sacrificed for us.

20:25.230 --> 20:27.930
I just wanted you to give you
a special birthday with
Uncle Ernesto.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.960
Then Uncle Kelbo sent a
magic chicken that tells
the future.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.900
It was too tempting.

20:32.930 --> 20:36.240
Yeah. Magic is always too
tempting for you, isn't it?

20:36.270 --> 20:41.280
- And I had to lie to my own
brother about what's going on.

20:41.310 --> 20:45.220
Which is exactly what
I was trying to avoid
in the first place.

20:46.620 --> 20:48.820
I'm sorry, Mom!

20:51.020 --> 20:54.590
What... What happened
to the party?

20:54.620 --> 20:56.960
I had to use the
police siren chirp spell.

20:56.990 --> 20:59.960
Everyone scattered.

21:01.200 --> 21:02.360
Where's Ernesto?

21:02.400 --> 21:04.030
He didn't see you
use magic, did he?

21:04.060 --> 21:07.970
No, no. He left
during the chaos.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.940
But, he did have that look on
his face that most people get

21:11.970 --> 21:14.240
when they're with us
more than an hour.

21:14.270 --> 21:20.140
So it's official. He hates us,
or he's confused by us, or both.

21:20.180 --> 21:23.480
Got it! The magic chicken
finally laid the answer egg.

21:23.510 --> 21:26.450
Now we can find out who wins
the wizard competition.

21:26.480 --> 21:27.880
I'll take that.

21:29.450 --> 21:30.590
Alex...?

21:34.060 --> 21:35.520
What'd you do that for?!

21:35.560 --> 21:37.430
It's my lame attempt
at showing Mom

21:37.460 --> 21:39.460
that we can make
sacrifices for her, too.

21:39.500 --> 21:42.160
Well, now we're never
gonna find out who wins
the wizard competition.

21:42.200 --> 21:45.740
How about right after we
have the wizard competition?

21:45.770 --> 21:47.470
I trust the chicken more.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.580
I'm sorry, Mom.

21:51.750 --> 21:54.110
I appreciate the
sacrifice, Alex.

21:54.150 --> 21:57.450
Whoo! Cake's ready! Yay!

21:57.480 --> 22:00.220
Harper, things are
still tense.

22:01.380 --> 22:03.550
Thank you for making
the cake, Harper.

22:03.590 --> 22:06.950
It's beautiful
and it looks delicious.

22:06.990 --> 22:09.960
Oh, no... we don't eat it.

22:09.990 --> 22:12.260
The Finkle tradition is that
you make a cake from scratch,

22:12.290 --> 22:15.630
then use rolling pins to smash
it, together as a family.

22:15.660 --> 22:18.700
It's the one time a year
we let out our frustrations.

22:18.730 --> 22:21.070
And I think the cake
is ready just in time.

22:21.100 --> 22:23.570
No one hit me in the face,
I'm goin' in.

22:23.600 --> 22:26.570
Let the cake-smushing begin
on the count of three. One...

22:27.480 --> 22:29.980
All right. Everybody smush!

22:31.210 --> 22:33.250
Whoo!

22:33.280 --> 22:35.380
- Yeah!
- Smush!

22:35.420 --> 22:36.880
That's great!

22:43.490 --> 22:46.090
Ernesto? You came back!

22:46.120 --> 22:49.260
Of course, I came back.
It turned into a party,
so I brought...

22:51.660 --> 22:55.630
Francisco, Angel, Rosa,
and the twins!

22:55.670 --> 22:58.200
Oh, I can't
believe you're here!

23:01.270 --> 23:03.000
Hey, what happened to the party?

23:03.040 --> 23:05.070
You're making me look bad
in front of my family.

23:05.110 --> 23:09.370
Uh... Well, I don't
want to lie to you.

23:09.410 --> 23:11.380
The police showed up
and everybody scattered.

23:11.410 --> 23:13.080
I...

23:13.110 --> 23:15.010
I've thrown great
parties like that before.

23:15.050 --> 23:17.020
It happens when
you're wildly popular.

23:17.050 --> 23:19.690
- Well...
- You've got great timing.

23:19.720 --> 23:22.150
We were just about to sing happy
birthday to the smushed cake.

23:27.490 --> 23:31.130
OK, great, but let's do it
like our family does it.

23:31.160 --> 23:32.700
Yeah.

23:32.730 --> 23:34.100
All right, gather 'round.

23:34.130 --> 23:36.530
And three, two, one...

23:52.110 --> 23:55.050
- Did you make a wish?
- I don't have to.

23:55.080 --> 23:56.820
It's already come true.

24:03.450 --> 24:04.720
Hey, guys!

24:06.560 --> 24:08.630
- Uncle Ernesto!
- I can explain.

24:08.660 --> 24:12.000
No need to explain.
I know what this room is.

24:13.730 --> 24:15.030
It's Max's fort.

24:16.970 --> 24:18.430
I always suspected it.

24:18.470 --> 24:20.770
All right, everydy out.
Yoheard Uncle Ernesto.

24:20.800 --> 24:21.940
It's my fort.

24:23.370 --> 24:24.570
Max, this is an amazing fort.

24:24.610 --> 24:26.070
Almost as amazing as mine.

24:26.110 --> 24:28.240
But not so amazing that they
would build a gift shop

24:28.280 --> 24:31.680
where they would sell miniature
versions of it.

24:33.210 --> 24:36.420
I'd love to use magic to make
this a real-sized fort.

24:36.450 --> 24:38.250
Max!

24:38.280 --> 24:41.390
- I bet you would, Max.
- Yeah.

24:41.420 --> 24:42.620
That's how amazing this fort is.

24:42.660 --> 24:45.620
When people see it,
they wish they had magic.
