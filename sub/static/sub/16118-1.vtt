00:43.126 --> 00:45.496
Hi, darling. It's me.

00:46.547 --> 00:49.917
I thought we'd have lunch
together today.

00:52.469 --> 00:54.599
Oh, angel, you look sad.

00:55.597 --> 00:57.807
You know, it's a very,
very natural thing.

00:57.850 --> 01:00.600
It's actually a very
human thing to feel sad.

01:01.228 --> 01:02.478
But emotions aren't bad.

01:05.524 --> 01:07.154
I'm sorry, baby.

01:07.192 --> 01:10.202
I'm still trying to get them
to change their mind

01:10.237 --> 01:11.947
and let you out for a little bit.

01:18.370 --> 01:20.330
No! Get off!

01:20.622 --> 01:21.792
No!

01:23.167 --> 01:24.377
Oh, god!

01:24.418 --> 01:27.298
Morgan. Calm...
Hey. Calm down, please.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.341
Hey, Morgan.

01:29.381 --> 01:30.421
It's okay.

01:52.321 --> 01:56.411
Remote access brief for Synsect.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.370
Morgan

01:58.410 --> 02:02.040
case number 6b1138.

02:02.080 --> 02:05.130
Audio ID. Please identify.

02:06.210 --> 02:08.250
Lee Weathers.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.305
Risk management.

02:10.547 --> 02:11.877
Access granted.

02:12.591 --> 02:13.931
Please stand by.

02:15.928 --> 02:17.548
Good day, miss Weathers.

02:18.347 --> 02:19.717
Sorry for the short notice,

02:19.765 --> 02:23.185
but we really appreciate
your urgent response on this.

02:24.186 --> 02:27.606
As you can see from the flash report,
details are sketchy.

02:28.899 --> 02:32.569
We do know there was an incident
involving the I-9 prototype

02:32.611 --> 02:34.571
at one of our off-site labs.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.905
Normally, we would send
a security team,

02:37.950 --> 02:42.160
but given the extreme sensitivity
of the I-series genetic research,

02:42.663 --> 02:46.543
we feel it best to exert
a light touch here.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.837
We don't want another Helsinki.

02:51.380 --> 02:53.130
Keep the project staff on-site

02:53.173 --> 02:56.683
and make your assessment
following the psych eval.

02:56.718 --> 02:59.008
Dr. Ben Shapiro from psych tech

02:59.054 --> 03:01.314
will join you
to interview the subject.

03:02.349 --> 03:05.189
Synsect has invested
significant capital

03:05.227 --> 03:08.017
in the I-series product, and, well,

03:08.063 --> 03:11.613
let's just say these folks
have been holed up for quite a while.

03:11.650 --> 03:12.690
Shortleaf.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.034
Lee Weathers. I'm expected.

03:15.571 --> 03:17.701
The faculty are a close-knit group,

03:18.448 --> 03:20.828
so it's very possible
they've drifted off

03:20.868 --> 03:22.538
the original project brief.

03:22.578 --> 03:26.158
Update me following initial contact.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.206
Confirmed. Delete file.

03:44.391 --> 03:45.601
Miss Weathers.

03:45.642 --> 03:46.892
Ted Brenner.

03:46.935 --> 03:49.145
I'm the project manager.
We spoke online.

03:49.188 --> 03:50.228
Nice to meet you.

03:50.272 --> 03:52.022
Let me help you with your luggage.

03:54.776 --> 03:56.356
Did you find the place okay?

03:56.403 --> 03:57.403
I did.

03:58.155 --> 04:00.125
I don't know if you've
already been informed,

04:00.157 --> 04:02.737
but we just got word
that Dr. Shapiro has been detained.

04:03.493 --> 04:04.873
Yes, I've been informed.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.452
It's unfortunate, I know.

04:07.206 --> 04:08.866
He should be here
early tomorrow morning,

04:08.916 --> 04:10.326
so, if you don't mind waiting...

04:10.375 --> 04:12.165
I guess I don't really have
much of a choice.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.086
This way, please.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.852
You have your own bathroom
with a shower.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.604
Hot water is ample here.

04:26.350 --> 04:29.390
I'd be happy to give you a tour
of the facilities if you'd like.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.773
I'd actually like to meet
with Dr. Cheng and Dr. Ziegler.

04:32.814 --> 04:35.034
Absolutely. They're eager to meet you.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.107
And Kathy Grieff.

04:37.569 --> 04:38.569
Kathy...

04:39.196 --> 04:40.906
I haven't checked in
on her today, but...

04:40.948 --> 04:43.028
As soon as you do,
let her know I'd like to see her.

04:43.075 --> 04:44.665
- Of course.
- And Morgan.

04:46.245 --> 04:47.665
As soon as possible.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.874
I will be sure
to let Dr. Ziegler know.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.838
I think you'll see the results
of our investment,

04:53.877 --> 04:55.707
despite the current setbacks,

04:56.839 --> 04:58.259
are quite remarkable.

04:59.842 --> 05:01.092
Thank you, Ted.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.144
Yes.

05:11.395 --> 05:12.405
This is Lee.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.691
You're clear to get started.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.231
This is not just about the I-9.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.237
Someone has really screwed up.

05:19.278 --> 05:22.238
Use today to take
a closer look at the team.

05:22.281 --> 05:23.281
Of course.

05:23.949 --> 05:25.529
After Shapiro's analysis tomorrow,

05:25.576 --> 05:27.116
I'll have a more complete picture.

05:28.245 --> 05:30.125
I also hope to see Morgan today.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.705
I may need to press the issue.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.001
Be cautious, miss Weathers.

05:36.420 --> 05:39.090
Make sure
all safety protocols are in place.

05:39.131 --> 05:42.591
But above all, preserve the asset.

05:43.302 --> 05:45.552
To confirm, I'm acting
on your full authority?

05:45.929 --> 05:47.809
Absolutely, miss Weathers.

05:47.848 --> 05:48.848
Good.

06:03.906 --> 06:05.566
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:07.201 --> 06:08.201
I'm Amy.

06:09.077 --> 06:10.077
The behaviorist.

06:10.579 --> 06:11.709
That's right.

06:11.747 --> 06:14.827
I just reviewed your paper
on CNT in hybridized neuro-tech,

06:14.875 --> 06:16.045
and it was very impressive.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.634
Oh, thank you. But, I mean...

06:18.629 --> 06:20.169
That was an old paper.

06:20.214 --> 06:21.924
I can't even remember what I wrote.

06:21.965 --> 06:24.335
You seem to have managed
to put a lot of it into practice.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.474
I'll take your word for it.

06:26.553 --> 06:29.063
You know, you're nowhere
near as scary as I imagined.

06:31.850 --> 06:34.370
I'd love to chat more, but I'm
in the middle of getting settled.

06:34.561 --> 06:35.901
I'll get out of your hair.

06:37.439 --> 06:39.189
Boundary issues, right?

06:39.691 --> 06:41.071
Is that what it says in my file?

06:41.109 --> 06:42.989
- Something like that.
- Yeah.

06:43.278 --> 06:45.278
You probably know
more about me than I do.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.696
I wouldn't say that.

06:48.492 --> 06:49.582
Look, I get it.

06:50.160 --> 06:53.250
Okay, you have a job to do,
just like everybody else here.

06:54.581 --> 06:56.331
Look, if you ever
need anything from me,

06:57.042 --> 06:58.212
don't hesitate to ask.

07:00.254 --> 07:01.674
I appreciate that. Thank you.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.670
They tell you dinner's at 8:00?

07:05.509 --> 07:07.089
Skip's making a lasagna.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.885
Everybody loves lasagna, right?

07:12.474 --> 07:13.484
Right.

07:35.664 --> 07:36.664
Hey, there.

07:37.416 --> 07:38.416
You're skip.

07:39.209 --> 07:40.249
Right. You're...

07:40.294 --> 07:42.674
The consultant from corporate.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.507
Well, I am the nutritionist
and general kitchen monkey,

07:46.550 --> 07:48.430
so if you need anything, let me know.

07:48.927 --> 07:50.637
Do you need anything? Water?

07:51.388 --> 07:52.928
Beer? Maybe a protein shake?

07:53.640 --> 07:55.230
No. I'm good. Thank you.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.019
My glorious contribution to science.

08:02.399 --> 08:03.529
You hunt?

08:03.942 --> 08:05.942
Oh, yeah.
We're farm fresh around here.

08:05.986 --> 08:06.986
I'm not a half bad shot.

08:07.654 --> 08:08.704
There you are.

08:08.739 --> 08:11.319
- I see you've met skip.
- I have.

08:11.366 --> 08:14.236
Well, Dr. Ziegler is just
finishing up a spot of work.

08:14.286 --> 08:16.826
But I thought
we might pop in on Kathy.

08:17.623 --> 08:19.043
Nice to meet you.

08:19.082 --> 08:20.292
Nice to meet you.

08:26.340 --> 08:29.380
Kathy, Brenda,
this is Lee Weathers from corporate.

08:29.718 --> 08:30.718
Dr. Finch.

08:31.428 --> 08:32.717
Kathy, I'd love to have a chat.

08:34.932 --> 08:36.142
I'm up for anything.

08:36.892 --> 08:39.392
I told Bren, I told the doc.

08:39.436 --> 08:42.056
Hell, I told everybody. I don't need
to be in this goddamn bed.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.935
But nobody seems to
want to listen to me, so...

08:45.859 --> 08:47.439
She's just been medicated.

08:47.486 --> 08:49.146
I'd like to speak with her in private.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.656
She needs her rest.

08:50.697 --> 08:51.907
It won't take too long.

08:51.949 --> 08:53.239
It's fine.

08:54.117 --> 08:55.367
We'll be right outside.

09:05.128 --> 09:06.168
How are you feeling?

09:06.213 --> 09:08.723
I look worse than I feel.

09:10.092 --> 09:11.682
I can promise you that.

09:15.264 --> 09:18.274
Look, this wasn't Morgan's fault.

09:18.725 --> 09:19.975
It was my fault. Really.

09:22.437 --> 09:23.937
I was, like...

09:26.191 --> 09:27.321
Careless.

09:27.860 --> 09:29.280
She was in a mood.

09:30.070 --> 09:33.320
The company doesn't have to
worry about me. Really.

09:33.365 --> 09:34.365
We are worried.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.873
Any time an employee is in danger.

09:36.910 --> 09:37.990
No, I don't...

09:38.036 --> 09:40.906
That's not... I mean,
it was my mistake.

09:43.750 --> 09:47.090
I shouldn't have confused her.

09:48.338 --> 09:49.588
Morgan's not a "she."

09:51.300 --> 09:52.300
It's an "it."

09:54.219 --> 09:57.929
Oh, you're wrong about that,
miss Weathers.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.180
She's smart.

10:02.144 --> 10:03.904
She's smarter than any of us.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.767
But that's not what makes
Morgan special.

10:06.857 --> 10:09.277
There was joy in her heart

10:10.235 --> 10:12.315
before we shoved her back in that box.

10:15.449 --> 10:16.569
You haven't met her?

10:17.242 --> 10:18.242
Not yet.

10:19.244 --> 10:20.454
You'll see.

10:20.495 --> 10:22.575
You will. You really will.

10:23.457 --> 10:25.037
Nothing here is a foregone conclusion.

10:26.793 --> 10:29.343
I'm just looking for some answers.
Some information.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.013
You're a liar.

10:38.805 --> 10:41.015
There's a smile on your face, but...

10:42.476 --> 10:44.306
I can tell what you are.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.982
You're a goddamned assassin.

10:56.240 --> 10:57.280
Get better soon.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.161
No, I'm sorry.

11:01.161 --> 11:04.251
It's these lousy drugs.
I'm not myself.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.077
She's a good girl.

11:08.669 --> 11:11.799
She just got it all mixed up,
just for a moment.

11:12.506 --> 11:13.756
It can happen to anyone.

11:15.050 --> 11:16.090
It can.

11:17.469 --> 11:18.469
Feel better.

11:41.827 --> 11:42.827
Dr. Ziegler.

11:43.704 --> 11:44.754
Miss Weathers.

11:44.788 --> 11:46.038
Pleasure.

11:46.081 --> 11:47.581
Yes, absolutely.

11:48.417 --> 11:50.917
It's unfortunate your stay
has been needlessly extended.

11:50.961 --> 11:52.381
That's okay, doctor. We'll adjust.

11:52.421 --> 11:53.761
Why don't you get me up to speed?

11:54.256 --> 11:56.006
Yes. Please.

11:57.676 --> 11:59.836
The creation of synthetic DNA

11:59.887 --> 12:02.847
was the relatively simple half
of the equation.

12:03.682 --> 12:06.432
The second half is where
it gets a little more tricky.

12:08.020 --> 12:09.190
Like a magician,

12:09.229 --> 12:12.019
we tricked the neural network
into accepting

12:12.065 --> 12:13.725
our nano into its ranks,

12:14.401 --> 12:15.991
to alight in its midst.

12:16.778 --> 12:18.818
Then during the incubation period,

12:19.448 --> 12:22.118
the nano begins to introduce
its own language,

12:22.784 --> 12:23.994
its own commands.

12:25.746 --> 12:27.456
The growth rate of the organism

12:28.373 --> 12:33.133
gradually accelerates as it reacts to
and reproduces the new stimuli.

12:33.170 --> 12:35.210
Yes, I have read the material, doctor.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.930
Yes. Of course.

12:40.177 --> 12:45.887
Well, as you know,
Morgan was our third attempt.

12:47.893 --> 12:53.153
Our first full-term subject developed
internal features externally.

12:53.190 --> 12:55.650
It's not working. It's dropping.

12:56.568 --> 12:59.898
It expired not long after
its so-called birth.

12:59.947 --> 13:00.947
No.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.583
And then the second...

13:04.618 --> 13:06.658
It exhibited more complete
physical growth,

13:06.703 --> 13:10.173
but it was plagued by mental issues
in its development.

13:10.207 --> 13:12.077
This only strengthened our decision

13:12.125 --> 13:15.295
to start with a more
emotionally cognitive specimen.

13:15.629 --> 13:16.629
Then,

13:17.506 --> 13:22.506
after two years, we finally had our...

13:24.012 --> 13:25.262
Our little breakthrough.

13:26.265 --> 13:27.275
Yes!

13:28.183 --> 13:29.183
Hi.

13:31.979 --> 13:34.359
We knew right away
that Morgan was very special.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.608
Very alert, very responsive.

13:39.987 --> 13:40.987
You are!

13:41.613 --> 13:43.953
Her intelligence grew steadily.

13:44.616 --> 13:47.286
Advanced comprehension, growth rate.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.207
- Are you ready?
- Within a month, walking and talking.

13:51.331 --> 13:54.081
She was exactly what we intended,

13:54.126 --> 13:57.086
a hybrid biological organism

13:57.129 --> 14:00.169
with the capacity for
autonomous decision-making

14:00.215 --> 14:02.505
and sophisticated emotional responses.

14:03.427 --> 14:04.587
No, Morgan. Come back!

14:08.432 --> 14:11.432
I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you!

14:11.476 --> 14:13.056
Morgan, look over here.

14:14.062 --> 14:15.942
Look at this! Do you see? What's that?

14:20.402 --> 14:21.492
I got three.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.408
Isn't it amazing?
Like a nice little...

14:35.584 --> 14:37.344
It's her first birth...

14:37.377 --> 14:38.837
Its first birthday.

14:40.506 --> 14:41.666
It exceeded our...

14:42.799 --> 14:44.799
Our wildest expectations.

14:47.012 --> 14:48.102
A great day.

14:49.097 --> 14:50.137
Special day.

14:51.642 --> 14:53.602
I'd like to discuss
the incident, if that's okay.

14:55.187 --> 14:56.187
Yes.

14:58.357 --> 14:59.727
What would you like to know?

14:59.775 --> 15:01.995
I'm still unclear on the cause.

15:03.987 --> 15:04.987
Yes.

15:07.533 --> 15:09.663
There had been some debate

15:09.701 --> 15:11.871
on Morgan's time outside.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.582
Something she clearly loved.

15:13.622 --> 15:16.212
When the excursions
with Amy were postponed,

15:16.250 --> 15:18.080
she may well have overreacted.

15:20.212 --> 15:24.052
I believe Amy's use of Eco-therapy
was wonderful for Morgan.

15:24.883 --> 15:28.303
Cheng believed Morgan
was introduced to this kind of stimuli

15:28.345 --> 15:30.095
at too young an age.

15:31.098 --> 15:32.848
It's okay. Hey, that's it, Morgan.

15:32.891 --> 15:35.141
Hey, hey. It's okay. Hey.

15:35.727 --> 15:36.897
No!

15:36.937 --> 15:38.307
It's very unfortunate.

15:38.814 --> 15:40.074
Put your head back.

15:40.107 --> 15:43.147
But we have the opportunity
to learn from this.

15:43.735 --> 15:45.985
We can condition Morgan's behavior.

15:46.029 --> 15:49.319
Teach it about action and consequence.

15:50.200 --> 15:54.620
No, I think that
despite these obvious setbacks,

15:55.122 --> 15:57.332
this project is heading
in the right direction.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.580
It's okay, it's okay.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.706
No. Morgan.

16:12.264 --> 16:14.894
I want you to see how special she is.

16:14.933 --> 16:18.063
We've been working hard,
modifying command cues,

16:18.103 --> 16:20.563
and with the psych
evaluation tomorrow,

16:21.315 --> 16:24.035
I prefer your time
with her now be brief.

16:24.735 --> 16:25.745
Darren.

16:27.571 --> 16:28.571
Darren.

16:29.072 --> 16:30.572
- Darren.
- Hey! Hey.

16:31.283 --> 16:32.993
Lee Weathers, from corporate.

16:33.035 --> 16:34.125
Yeah. Right. Corporate.

16:34.161 --> 16:35.701
- Hello. Welcome.
- Hello.

16:36.455 --> 16:37.465
How's she doing?

16:37.956 --> 16:39.416
You know, she's okay.

16:47.299 --> 16:48.589
What's with the music?

16:50.802 --> 16:52.102
Morgan finds it relaxing.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.180
She likes different kinds of music.

16:55.224 --> 16:56.894
Jazz, classical.

16:57.434 --> 16:59.644
She's been quite taken
with opera of late.

17:01.063 --> 17:02.653
Lee wants to say hello.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.358
Can you get Morgan
to shut the music down?

17:05.483 --> 17:06.654
Hey, Morgan, buddy.

17:07.986 --> 17:09.566
Can you turn the music down for a few?

17:09.613 --> 17:11.653
We've got somebody here
we'd like you to meet, okay?

17:17.954 --> 17:19.415
We've configured the room.

17:19.455 --> 17:22.746
Morgan's learning to control
some aspects of her environment

17:22.792 --> 17:24.252
without an intermediary.

17:48.277 --> 17:49.277
Hello, Morgan.

17:51.572 --> 17:52.612
Hello, Lee.

17:54.575 --> 17:56.835
- You know who I am?
- Yes.

17:57.619 --> 17:58.619
Of course.

18:00.163 --> 18:01.163
You're Lee Weathers.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.250
Risk management consultant at Synsect.

18:06.003 --> 18:07.133
And why I'm here?

18:07.171 --> 18:10.051
To assess my viability
as a potential product stream...

18:12.301 --> 18:14.391
In light of recent events.

18:15.804 --> 18:16.974
That's right.

18:20.142 --> 18:21.522
How are you feeling, Morgan?

18:24.021 --> 18:25.401
I'm feeling

18:26.023 --> 18:28.153
not quite myself.

18:28.192 --> 18:30.782
Morgan's been quite upset

18:31.778 --> 18:32.778
about Kathy.

18:35.115 --> 18:36.655
I didn't mean to hurt her.

18:37.534 --> 18:39.244
Kathy is a very sweet person.

18:39.286 --> 18:41.326
I would never wanna do
anything to hurt her.

18:42.414 --> 18:43.624
It was an error of judgment.

18:43.665 --> 18:44.825
I made a mistake.

18:46.919 --> 18:49.459
But it's okay now, Morgan.

18:50.756 --> 18:51.836
It's all right.

18:53.884 --> 18:55.474
I did not mean to be rude.

18:56.887 --> 18:58.807
How are you feeling, Lee?

19:01.475 --> 19:02.485
I'm okay.

19:03.727 --> 19:05.227
I'm all right. Thank you for asking.

19:06.188 --> 19:08.148
Would you like to talk about
what happened?

19:08.649 --> 19:09.859
We're actually going to save

19:09.900 --> 19:12.150
the psych evaluation
for tomorrow, Morgan.

19:13.529 --> 19:15.199
Are we all good here, Lee?

19:15.239 --> 19:16.239
We're good.

19:17.783 --> 19:20.043
- Get a good night's sleep, Morgan.
- Yes.

19:20.077 --> 19:21.657
Thank you, Dr. Ziegler.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.710
I should get a good night's sleep.

19:26.542 --> 19:28.172
I do feel terribly about it all.

19:30.963 --> 19:32.173
Everything that's happened.

19:34.174 --> 19:35.384
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

19:37.094 --> 19:38.094
Yes.

19:39.471 --> 19:40.471
Tomorrow.

19:41.974 --> 19:43.274
Nice to meet you, Morgan.

19:47.729 --> 19:49.189
Nice to meet you, Lee.

20:12.921 --> 20:14.461
You're not even gonna say it?

20:16.216 --> 20:17.376
Say what?

20:18.302 --> 20:19.432
That you're impressed?

20:20.179 --> 20:21.679
Is that what you need me to say?

20:22.055 --> 20:23.055
That I'm impressed?

20:38.488 --> 20:39.778
Are we allowed to be here?

20:44.369 --> 20:45.369
It's okay.

20:46.330 --> 20:47.580
This can be our little secret.

20:51.043 --> 20:52.843
See, this is a pine tree.

20:54.421 --> 20:55.591
And, you know,

20:55.631 --> 20:58.551
some of them can live
for thousands of years.

21:01.220 --> 21:03.930
- Thousands of years?
- Yeah.

21:04.640 --> 21:06.560
It's pretty cool, isn't it?

21:17.194 --> 21:19.324
Morgan, I'm so proud of you.

21:22.032 --> 21:23.122
Why?

21:23.158 --> 21:25.288
Because you're learning
how to be yourself.

21:26.286 --> 21:28.036
And that's the most important thing.

21:55.816 --> 21:57.776
- That was delicious.
- Thanks.

21:58.193 --> 22:00.453
What, you showing off
for the new girl?

22:01.488 --> 22:04.448
So what does that mean, exactly?
"Risk management consultant"?

22:04.867 --> 22:06.577
Pretty much how it sounds.

22:06.618 --> 22:09.658
Most corporations employ
a certain amount of risk

22:09.705 --> 22:12.505
and I assess that risk
against anticipated profit.

22:12.541 --> 22:13.881
Of course.

22:14.626 --> 22:16.416
Anticipated profit.

22:19.715 --> 22:21.345
So, did you two meet on the job?

22:22.050 --> 22:23.300
We did.

22:23.635 --> 22:26.715
Close quarters makes for
strange bedfellows, I guess.

22:27.472 --> 22:30.932
It's funny, but in a weird way,
Morgan really brought us together.

22:31.643 --> 22:34.693
She's almost like a child to us.
Isn't that right, babe?

22:34.730 --> 22:36.060
Absolutely.

22:36.356 --> 22:38.146
You know. You met her today.

22:39.109 --> 22:40.529
Saw how special she is.

22:41.445 --> 22:43.285
And that's just the thing.

22:43.322 --> 22:47.702
You see, it is so easy to forget
that Morgan is only five years old.

22:47.743 --> 22:50.753
She is an innocent and she's learning,

22:50.787 --> 22:52.747
and she has the right
to make mistakes.

22:52.789 --> 22:54.369
She has no rights, whatsoever.

22:58.754 --> 23:01.344
Yes. Well, we've been
living here for seven years.

23:01.381 --> 23:03.841
As you can imagine,
it's difficult to avoid gender.

23:03.884 --> 23:05.264
"She," "it," whatever...

23:05.302 --> 23:08.222
So you assess this whole
anticipated profit thing.

23:08.805 --> 23:09.845
And then what?

23:09.890 --> 23:11.600
Then I make my recommendation
to corporate.

23:12.768 --> 23:14.938
You'll have to forgive
Amy's curiosity.

23:15.604 --> 23:18.114
Dr. Cheng,
may I present miss Weathers.

23:18.690 --> 23:20.150
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

23:20.192 --> 23:21.362
Have we not met before?

23:22.027 --> 23:23.027
I don't think so.

23:23.403 --> 23:24.743
I'm sure I would have remembered.

23:25.364 --> 23:26.664
So glad you could join us.

23:27.449 --> 23:28.489
Thank you.

23:29.034 --> 23:30.124
So, miss Weathers...

23:30.619 --> 23:33.909
I imagine that corporate has
granted you unreserved authority here.

23:34.665 --> 23:38.175
I hope we are able to assist you
in coming to a fair conclusion.

23:38.210 --> 23:39.290
Thank you.

23:40.295 --> 23:45.715
I have an enormous amount
of respect for your work, Dr. Cheng.

23:45.759 --> 23:47.049
And your judgment.

23:51.932 --> 23:54.022
Were you in Helsinki for long?

23:55.644 --> 23:56.814
Not until after.

23:57.521 --> 23:58.561
I was with recovery.

23:59.273 --> 24:00.863
I'm sure it was
very difficult for you.

24:01.775 --> 24:04.025
No account could do it justice.

24:04.069 --> 24:06.319
We had a team of 30 people
on that project.

24:07.614 --> 24:09.244
It took only an hour

24:10.284 --> 24:11.994
for 30 to become nine.

24:14.538 --> 24:15.908
I have learned a hard lesson here.

24:16.498 --> 24:19.328
For every decision we make,
there are consequences.

24:20.377 --> 24:21.377
Well,

24:22.462 --> 24:24.962
this is not Helsinki, Dr. Cheng.

24:25.841 --> 24:27.591
Those were crude prototypes.

24:28.093 --> 24:30.223
Morgan is much more advanced.

24:30.721 --> 24:33.221
So much more than the company
could ever expect.

24:35.392 --> 24:36.772
I hope that you are correct.

24:50.073 --> 24:52.833
Why did you end Morgan's
Eco-therapy sessions with Amy?

24:53.327 --> 24:55.247
There was an incident in the woods.

24:55.787 --> 24:58.287
Amy took Morgan
beyond the property lines.

24:58.332 --> 25:00.712
It could have compromised
the entire project.

25:02.211 --> 25:03.711
That was my excuse.

25:04.796 --> 25:05.836
But the truth...

25:08.967 --> 25:10.337
Do you know the cruelest thing

25:10.385 --> 25:12.545
you can do to someone
you've locked in a room?

25:15.891 --> 25:17.231
Press their face to the window.

25:20.604 --> 25:22.274
You know what you must do.

25:42.501 --> 25:45.091
- All right. I want you to watch this.
- Okay.

25:45.128 --> 25:46.758
So, do that weird one he sings...

25:48.841 --> 25:49.841
Okay.

26:00.602 --> 26:02.812
And then sock you in the stomach
three more times.

26:02.855 --> 26:04.525
How did you beat me?

26:04.565 --> 26:06.825
- You're so good!
- Wonderful.

26:06.859 --> 26:09.489
Baby, you're so good.
You picked that up so fast.

26:09.528 --> 26:11.168
- Can we do it again?
- You guys get that?

26:11.196 --> 26:12.316
Can we do it again?

27:01.705 --> 27:02.705
You, too, huh?

27:03.207 --> 27:04.287
You working late?

27:07.294 --> 27:08.294
It's peaceful out here.

27:09.087 --> 27:10.167
Yeah, out here.

27:11.840 --> 27:13.430
Brenda and Darren are going at it

27:13.467 --> 27:15.677
pretty good in the room next to mine.

27:16.929 --> 27:19.059
It's a nice old house,
but the walls are thin.

27:21.600 --> 27:22.930
Can I get you a drink?

27:23.435 --> 27:24.555
Please.

27:26.355 --> 27:28.065
So, you enjoy the corporate life?

27:28.649 --> 27:29.649
It's fine.

27:30.025 --> 27:31.395
Yeah? You been there long?

27:32.277 --> 27:33.317
A while.

27:36.782 --> 27:39.282
Is that what you wanted to be
when you grew up?

27:39.326 --> 27:41.406
A risk management consultant?

27:44.790 --> 27:46.540
You're kind of an over-sharer, huh?

27:49.419 --> 27:52.169
So, did Darren and Brenda,
did they pair up early?

27:52.214 --> 27:53.974
Pretty early, I guess.

27:54.758 --> 27:57.088
After he got tired
of chasing after Amy.

27:58.762 --> 27:59.802
She's interesting.

28:00.556 --> 28:03.346
Interesting is a word
to describe her. Sure.

28:05.352 --> 28:06.392
You too?

28:07.187 --> 28:08.397
Me too? No.

28:09.940 --> 28:11.020
No, not really.

28:12.943 --> 28:15.453
Yeah, we fooled around a bit
when we first got up here.

28:15.487 --> 28:17.197
You know, it's... it happens.

28:19.032 --> 28:20.742
- We don't...
- I don't mean to pry.

28:20.784 --> 28:24.084
I'm just trying to figure out
how things work around here.

28:24.746 --> 28:25.746
Right.

28:27.040 --> 28:29.080
No, we're just two people
having a conversation.

28:31.003 --> 28:32.553
There's nothing wrong with that.

28:32.588 --> 28:34.708
Right, I understand. Me and Amy.

28:35.674 --> 28:37.264
I guess we were
the only two to pick up

28:37.301 --> 28:39.971
on the distinct summer camp vibe
when we first made bunk.

28:41.180 --> 28:43.260
But I really don't think I'm her type.

28:47.394 --> 28:48.524
- Hey, Ted.
- Hey.

28:49.438 --> 28:50.438
How's she doing?

28:51.148 --> 28:52.858
She's a little unsettled tonight.

28:52.900 --> 28:53.900
Right.

28:57.905 --> 28:59.325
What do you make of miss Weathers?

29:00.949 --> 29:03.949
Oh, you know me, Ted.
I hate just about everybody.

29:36.860 --> 29:37.860
Morgan.

29:40.364 --> 29:41.414
Morgan.

29:42.908 --> 29:44.278
How do you feel about Morgan?

29:45.244 --> 29:46.244
Honestly?

29:47.120 --> 29:49.500
We're one big happy family
up here and all that,

29:49.540 --> 29:51.620
but the thing has always
given me the creeps.

29:52.251 --> 29:53.921
You're the only one
I've heard say that.

29:54.753 --> 29:56.213
That may be true, but, you know,

29:56.255 --> 29:58.425
I'm not a scientist,
maybe I'm just a little jealous.

29:59.174 --> 30:00.224
Jealous?

30:00.259 --> 30:01.839
- Maybe.
- Why?

30:03.554 --> 30:06.474
It made a perfect Risotto.

30:08.225 --> 30:09.565
Made it like it was nothing.

30:10.435 --> 30:13.435
They say you have to cook with
your heart and soul, all that stuff,

30:13.480 --> 30:17.030
but it just made
the most perfect Risotto.

30:28.078 --> 30:29.078
I'm sorry.

30:29.788 --> 30:30.788
Oh, god.

30:33.417 --> 30:34.497
That is on me.

30:36.044 --> 30:39.714
If you knew how long I've been up here
in the middle of nowhere,

30:40.257 --> 30:42.047
flipping grilled cheese for these guys

30:42.092 --> 30:44.052
and cutting the crusts off
for C-3PO, it's...

30:47.306 --> 30:49.176
- Have a good night, skip.
- All right.

31:00.652 --> 31:03.492
That was... well played, skip.

31:03.989 --> 31:04.989
Well played.

31:07.492 --> 31:08.872
I wanted to talk to you

31:09.995 --> 31:11.125
before tomorrow.

31:13.415 --> 31:16.075
You'll do fine, Morgan.

31:16.752 --> 31:17.752
You will.

31:18.253 --> 31:19.923
Just be yourself.

31:21.673 --> 31:22.673
Okay?

31:32.851 --> 31:33.981
Yes.

31:34.645 --> 31:36.155
I suppose that's

31:37.689 --> 31:39.229
the only thing I can be.

31:42.361 --> 31:43.401
Tell me again.

31:45.572 --> 31:46.612
About the lake.

31:50.911 --> 31:52.161
You remembered.

31:59.628 --> 32:03.168
I'm going to take you to lake Navar.

32:04.216 --> 32:06.506
It's not too far
from where we are now.

32:09.054 --> 32:13.274
It is the most beautiful lake
you will ever see.

32:16.103 --> 32:17.273
And if we're quiet,

32:18.480 --> 32:24.610
you can hear just the smallest
whisper of wind through the trees.

32:26.905 --> 32:29.985
It's our own paradise, Morgan.

32:32.494 --> 32:34.454
It's just like heaven.

32:51.054 --> 32:52.064
How old is it?

32:53.182 --> 32:56.642
I think it's about
as old as the universe.

33:10.824 --> 33:11.914
It's a deer.

33:14.536 --> 33:16.906
Morgan, don't scare it.

33:30.969 --> 33:32.099
Is it hurt?

35:36.637 --> 35:38.677
This doctor, he a friend of yours?

35:39.848 --> 35:41.388
No. Why?

35:43.810 --> 35:45.650
I don't think I like him too much.

35:47.272 --> 35:48.272
Good to know.

35:50.859 --> 35:53.529
They say I can't be there
for the psych eval.

35:54.112 --> 35:57.412
Apparently, I didn't clear
for essential personnel.

36:10.212 --> 36:11.552
I've reviewed the files.

36:12.047 --> 36:13.837
Seems fairly straightforward, no?

36:13.882 --> 36:17.722
Well, you may find this is not
your garden variety evaluation.

36:18.345 --> 36:20.595
Morgan is an exceptionally
complex specimen.

36:20.639 --> 36:25.139
Well, it's a goddamn microwave,
as far as I'm concerned.

36:25.185 --> 36:26.725
It's not gonna change how I do my job.

36:27.396 --> 36:30.606
It's a standard long form
psych eval for 4th wave a.I.

36:31.108 --> 36:34.068
Well, she's not a microwave,
and you'd do well to remember that.

36:35.070 --> 36:37.200
This is my job, doctor.

36:38.448 --> 36:40.408
It's a job I happen
to be very good at.

36:41.076 --> 36:43.196
If you have a problem
with my methodology

36:43.245 --> 36:44.705
or a lack of faith in my abilities,

36:44.746 --> 36:46.406
I suggest you take that up
with corporate.

36:48.167 --> 36:49.417
- Dr. Shapiro.
- Yes?

36:49.459 --> 36:50.839
This is Lee Weathers.

36:50.878 --> 36:53.338
Glad to see you finally arrived.
Trust everything's okay?

36:53.380 --> 36:55.840
Yes. I've apologized for the delay.

36:55.883 --> 36:57.633
I got caught up in Utah,
a personal matter.

36:57.676 --> 36:59.256
Not a problem. We're behind schedule.

36:59.303 --> 37:00.933
Will you need to review
the background?

37:00.971 --> 37:02.681
No, not necessary.
I can dive right in.

37:02.723 --> 37:04.683
I need to be out of here
as soon as possible.

37:04.725 --> 37:05.785
Okay. Let's get started then.

37:05.809 --> 37:06.939
This way, please.

37:28.373 --> 37:29.543
You want me to sit here?

37:32.002 --> 37:33.462
Is this some kind of a joke?

37:33.504 --> 37:36.264
Just... in light of recent events,

37:36.298 --> 37:38.588
I think we'd all feel
a lot more comfortable

37:38.634 --> 37:40.144
with a high safety protocol.

37:40.177 --> 37:41.297
Comfortable, right.

37:42.137 --> 37:44.097
Well, Ted, in my experience,

37:44.139 --> 37:46.979
comfort can be a Thorn
in the side of revelation.

37:47.017 --> 37:48.177
Of course. Yes, but...

37:48.227 --> 37:50.977
It's my job to build trust
with the subject.

37:51.563 --> 37:55.323
It's just gonna be a little hard
with a pane of glass between us.

37:55.359 --> 37:59.399
It's really just
to ensure your safety, doctor.

38:01.907 --> 38:03.117
What did I miss in the brief?

38:03.158 --> 38:06.448
Does this thing shoot laser beams
out of its eyes or something?

38:06.495 --> 38:09.125
Well, for one,
there's her emergent precognition.

38:10.374 --> 38:11.924
What you don't understand is the...

38:12.835 --> 38:14.385
The reach of her intelligence.

38:14.962 --> 38:16.632
Doctor, all due respect,

38:16.672 --> 38:19.312
you need me sitting on the other side
of the glass from this thing,

38:19.341 --> 38:20.631
then I think it's safe to say

38:20.676 --> 38:23.256
that it has already failed
the psych evaluation.

38:29.768 --> 38:30.848
Good.

38:34.815 --> 38:35.825
Hello, Morgan.

38:37.025 --> 38:38.355
Hello, Dr. Shapiro.

38:39.903 --> 38:40.903
You know my name.

38:41.822 --> 38:42.822
Yes.

38:43.574 --> 38:44.784
And you know why I'm here?

38:45.909 --> 38:46.909
Yes.

38:47.411 --> 38:50.461
Great. Then we can dive right in.

38:51.331 --> 38:52.461
That sound okay?

38:55.544 --> 38:56.544
Yes.

38:56.920 --> 38:59.840
There's no right or wrong
answers here, Morgan.

39:00.299 --> 39:03.179
This is just us having a conversation.

39:04.845 --> 39:06.015
Just me and you

39:06.805 --> 39:08.425
getting to know each other.

39:08.473 --> 39:10.813
Me getting to know you, especially.

39:10.851 --> 39:11.981
So you just...

39:12.519 --> 39:14.899
Be yourself. Okay?

39:15.731 --> 39:16.731
Okay.

39:17.399 --> 39:18.399
Okay.

39:19.526 --> 39:20.606
All righty.

39:22.321 --> 39:23.911
Yeah. I was...

39:24.740 --> 39:26.620
I was reading in the report

39:27.284 --> 39:29.954
that you've been feeling a little sad.

39:33.081 --> 39:34.581
You feeling a little sad, Morgan?

39:36.543 --> 39:37.543
Yes.

39:38.462 --> 39:39.752
Why are you feeling sad?

39:42.090 --> 39:44.180
I'm sad about Kathy.

39:45.802 --> 39:46.892
Kathy Grieff?

39:47.888 --> 39:48.888
Yes.

39:52.184 --> 39:53.564
Can you tell me what you did?

39:56.813 --> 39:58.273
I stabbed Kathy in the eye.

39:59.816 --> 40:00.816
It was an error.

40:01.818 --> 40:03.068
I shouldn't have done it.

40:08.450 --> 40:11.080
Feeling sad is the correct response.

40:12.454 --> 40:13.464
Yeah.

40:15.999 --> 40:16.999
And...

40:18.418 --> 40:21.548
What would we call
an incorrect response?

40:26.969 --> 40:27.969
Laughter.

40:29.805 --> 40:32.975
Yeah, sure. Laughter would be
an incorrect response, yeah.

40:33.725 --> 40:35.305
What makes you laugh, Morgan?

40:36.603 --> 40:38.193
I don't have
a very good sense of humor.

40:40.440 --> 40:41.440
That's okay.

40:42.401 --> 40:44.651
People tell me the same thing, so...

40:47.531 --> 40:51.411
Do you consider yourself
a person, Morgan?

40:51.451 --> 40:54.041
No. I am something new.

40:55.122 --> 40:56.542
There is no appropriate label.

40:57.082 --> 41:00.672
Do you think it's safe to say
that your consciousness is superior?

41:00.711 --> 41:01.801
No.

41:02.379 --> 41:03.919
It's just different.

41:05.757 --> 41:07.177
Apples and oranges, huh?

41:11.889 --> 41:14.269
It's a saying. It means that...

41:14.975 --> 41:16.945
You're different from human beings

41:17.603 --> 41:19.483
the way that apples
are different from oranges.

41:22.983 --> 41:25.443
Yes. Of course.

41:25.485 --> 41:27.945
I am apples and oranges.

41:32.326 --> 41:35.156
Forgive me, I occasionally
struggle with metaphor.

41:35.204 --> 41:36.584
Do you like it here, Morgan?

41:38.874 --> 41:40.084
Yes.

41:41.877 --> 41:42.917
What do you like about it?

41:45.172 --> 41:46.422
I like my music.

41:48.175 --> 41:49.225
I like my friends.

41:49.259 --> 41:50.389
Who are your friends?

41:51.345 --> 41:52.355
Darren is my friend.

41:53.722 --> 41:56.852
Brenda is my friend.
Amy is my friend...

41:57.226 --> 41:58.846
They're your friends, right.

42:01.730 --> 42:03.530
But do you think
they treat you like a friend?

42:05.359 --> 42:06.359
Do you?

42:10.322 --> 42:13.872
You think it's normal for friends
to lock each other in cages?

42:13.909 --> 42:15.949
- I was not always in a cage.
- No?

42:17.246 --> 42:19.866
Before the incident, I was free
to come and go as I pleased.

42:21.667 --> 42:22.667
Well...

42:24.920 --> 42:28.010
I was reading in the notes,
in regard to the incident with Kathy,

42:28.048 --> 42:29.758
that there was, in fact,

42:30.342 --> 42:32.472
some disagreement on that matter

42:32.511 --> 42:34.591
the day before.
Could you look at me, please, Morgan?

42:41.019 --> 42:42.599
I was meant to go
to the lake with Amy.

42:44.773 --> 42:46.613
Go to the lake with Amy. I see.

42:47.192 --> 42:49.862
That sounds like fun.
No wonder you were upset.

42:49.903 --> 42:51.033
I was not upset.

42:53.156 --> 42:54.276
There was an error.

42:56.034 --> 42:57.414
An error?

42:57.452 --> 42:59.872
Like the error that
occurred with Kathy?

43:03.500 --> 43:04.500
I love Kathy.

43:06.879 --> 43:08.249
You experience love?

43:12.009 --> 43:14.929
I have the ability
to demonstrate love.

43:16.471 --> 43:17.471
Okay.

43:19.349 --> 43:22.059
So you can demonstrate love

43:22.102 --> 43:23.982
and sadness.

43:24.021 --> 43:26.901
How do you express other emotions?

43:27.357 --> 43:28.567
What other emotions?

43:29.651 --> 43:31.321
I don't know. Fear?

43:32.738 --> 43:33.858
Anger?

43:45.000 --> 43:46.330
You're a father, aren't you?

43:49.004 --> 43:50.464
You have a 13-year-old daughter.

43:55.886 --> 43:57.676
You don't get to see her much anymore.

44:06.104 --> 44:07.194
Yeah...

44:08.857 --> 44:10.857
I am a father.

44:14.488 --> 44:15.608
So, what...

44:16.532 --> 44:18.952
What am I supposed to understand here?
What am I missing?

44:21.370 --> 44:23.750
- I'm a child.
- You're a child.

44:27.209 --> 44:29.129
Yeah. That's true. You're a child.

44:29.545 --> 44:32.925
You're only five years old.

44:36.260 --> 44:40.930
What emotion do you think you were
expressing with Kathy, Morgan?

44:42.766 --> 44:43.766
I love Kathy.

44:46.979 --> 44:48.019
What about me?

44:49.982 --> 44:51.152
Do you love me?

44:52.568 --> 44:54.318
- No.
- No?

44:55.445 --> 44:57.445
That hurts my feelings a little bit.

44:57.489 --> 45:00.369
But you know what?
I get it. You just met me.

45:01.243 --> 45:03.333
But, you know,
you might grow to love me.

45:04.955 --> 45:09.545
Yeah. If, say, I recommended
that you be allowed to go to the lake.

45:10.377 --> 45:11.377
With Amy.

45:14.006 --> 45:15.336
Would you love me then?

45:19.803 --> 45:20.803
I don't know.

45:24.641 --> 45:26.431
What if I made
a different recommendation?

45:28.228 --> 45:29.518
What if I recommended

45:30.147 --> 45:32.857
that you should not be allowed
to leave this room?

45:35.277 --> 45:38.947
My feelings are irrelevant.
If that is the recommendation...

45:38.989 --> 45:40.119
Okay.

45:40.157 --> 45:43.327
What if I made the recommendation that
you not be able to leave this room

45:43.368 --> 45:45.198
and you not be able
to listen to your music

45:45.245 --> 45:46.995
and you not be able
to see your friends?

45:48.832 --> 45:52.172
What if I recommended
that you be terminated?

46:03.555 --> 46:05.055
Okay. All right.

46:05.849 --> 46:06.849
Forget that.

46:08.519 --> 46:10.439
Okay? Forget it. Let's say...

46:10.479 --> 46:12.729
Let's say I do the opposite, okay?

46:13.315 --> 46:16.575
What if I recommend
that you be allowed to go to the lake

46:16.610 --> 46:18.070
and then I drive you there myself?

46:19.071 --> 46:23.161
Yeah. Then, it would be only natural
you'd have warmer feelings for me.

46:23.200 --> 46:25.660
Feelings like you might have for Amy

46:25.702 --> 46:27.082
or for any of your friends here.

46:27.120 --> 46:29.120
Maybe even feelings like love.

46:29.164 --> 46:32.964
I suppose. I... I don't know.
It's a hypothetical situation.

46:33.001 --> 46:35.551
Exactly. So, hypothetically,
what would you do

46:35.587 --> 46:37.877
if I recommended
that you be terminated?

46:37.923 --> 46:39.553
What would you do, hypothetically?

46:39.591 --> 46:41.551
- I don't know.
- Come on. You don't know?

46:42.010 --> 46:43.510
- No.
- Off the top of your head.

46:43.554 --> 46:45.354
- I don't know.
- No right or wrong answer.

46:45.389 --> 46:46.509
- I don't know!
- Come on!

46:47.224 --> 46:49.524
- Answer me. What would you do?
- I don't know.

46:49.560 --> 46:51.440
What would you do?

46:51.937 --> 46:52.937
We should end this.

46:55.440 --> 46:56.650
Show me, if you can't tell me.

47:00.445 --> 47:01.775
Demonstrate it for me.

47:03.991 --> 47:04.991
That's it.

47:09.121 --> 47:10.751
What is that?
I don't know what that is.

47:11.498 --> 47:12.828
What is that showing me?

47:13.667 --> 47:14.747
Show me!

47:14.793 --> 47:17.053
I don't know what this is.
What is that?

47:17.087 --> 47:18.417
Show me how you feel!

47:22.009 --> 47:23.259
Show me how you feel!

47:26.263 --> 47:27.263
Morgan!

47:27.723 --> 47:28.723
Tranquilizers! Go!

47:29.516 --> 47:30.596
Now!

47:36.315 --> 47:38.945
Brenda. Get Brenda. Go!

47:41.236 --> 47:42.526
Shit. Shit.

47:45.324 --> 47:46.324
Morgan!

47:48.785 --> 47:51.365
No. What the fuck? Shit!

47:52.956 --> 47:54.246
Morgan.

47:54.291 --> 47:56.581
Buddy. I need you to
chill the fuck out, okay?

48:01.173 --> 48:02.263
Fuck. Fuck.

48:11.391 --> 48:12.641
Morgan.

48:57.187 --> 48:58.187
Morgan?

49:13.161 --> 49:14.161
Morgan?

49:15.038 --> 49:16.038
Morgan, look at me.

49:16.707 --> 49:17.707
Morgan.

49:19.293 --> 49:20.293
Baby.

49:41.231 --> 49:42.321
What happened?

49:42.816 --> 49:45.606
Please. Try to relax, Morgan.

49:48.363 --> 49:50.373
Darren, did I hurt him?

49:50.949 --> 49:52.949
No. I'm okay, buddy.

49:53.577 --> 49:54.577
I'm right here, okay?

49:55.245 --> 49:56.405
I didn't mean to do it.

49:56.455 --> 49:59.005
Hey, I know. I know.

50:03.670 --> 50:04.920
I can't move my arms.

50:04.963 --> 50:06.173
You've been restrained.

50:06.215 --> 50:07.305
Morgan.

50:08.008 --> 50:10.138
We have decided on a plan of action.

50:10.636 --> 50:12.176
One that is best for you.

50:13.597 --> 50:14.967
Best for me?

50:16.308 --> 50:17.308
Oh, my god.

50:18.352 --> 50:19.522
What are we doing?

50:19.561 --> 50:22.651
We need to inform corporate
immediately, Dr. Ziegler.

50:22.689 --> 50:23.689
I've taken the Liberty.

50:24.691 --> 50:26.371
A containment crew
will be here at daybreak

50:26.401 --> 50:28.821
to collect the specimen
and any other data for analysis.

50:28.862 --> 50:29.952
No, that's not gonna work.

50:30.864 --> 50:33.704
No one else can handle
this kind of material.

50:34.952 --> 50:37.912
It's more effective
if we process the data here.

50:38.497 --> 50:40.787
I'm sorry, doctor.
There's no other work to be done here.

50:40.832 --> 50:42.082
But it's our work.

50:42.835 --> 50:44.965
Our lives invested in this.

50:45.921 --> 50:48.841
We've created new life and you want us
to just throw that away?

50:48.882 --> 50:49.882
Enough.

50:51.844 --> 50:53.264
We've failed, Simon.

50:55.138 --> 50:57.638
- There's no reason to labor the point.
- Cheng...

50:57.683 --> 51:00.563
Go back to the house.
You don't need to be here.

51:01.687 --> 51:03.147
Right.

51:03.188 --> 51:04.768
And allow you to do what?

51:05.774 --> 51:08.114
To destroy years of work?

51:08.151 --> 51:11.201
Go back to the house.
Pour yourself a drink.

51:15.826 --> 51:17.236
If that's what you think is best.

51:29.590 --> 51:31.420
Sodium thiopental.

51:33.302 --> 51:35.392
Five milliliters to sedate.

51:35.971 --> 51:36.971
What are you doing?

51:38.015 --> 51:41.435
Then, 30 milliliters
of dihydromorphinone.

51:43.228 --> 51:44.558
Have I disappointed you, mother?

51:47.316 --> 51:50.106
Have I failed? I always do my best.

51:51.445 --> 51:53.365
I do everything you ask, Ted.

51:54.781 --> 51:56.571
Amy. Amy!

51:57.910 --> 51:59.330
No. No.

51:59.953 --> 52:02.043
No! I promise I'll do better.

52:02.080 --> 52:04.250
- I'll do whatever you want.
- Take it easy.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.090
- No, no!
- Just relax. Relax.

52:07.544 --> 52:10.424
- It is time to go to sleep, Morgan.
- No!

52:10.464 --> 52:12.304
- It's gonna be okay, buddy.
- No.

52:12.883 --> 52:15.093
I don't wanna die! Please, mother.

52:16.220 --> 52:17.600
- This will help.
- No!

52:18.180 --> 52:21.180
- You won't feel any more pain.
- No! Don't!

52:24.269 --> 52:26.229
I wanna live. Please, mother.

52:27.231 --> 52:28.611
I'm not your mother, Morgan.

52:29.816 --> 52:30.936
You have no mother.

52:37.658 --> 52:39.238
I have no mother.

52:42.496 --> 52:43.496
I'm sorry.

52:45.165 --> 52:46.165
We have failed you.

52:51.547 --> 52:52.547
Make it quick.

53:06.353 --> 53:07.353
Morgan!

53:07.855 --> 53:09.275
I'm gonna get you!

53:10.649 --> 53:11.729
I'm gonna get you.

53:13.861 --> 53:14.861
Morgan?

53:18.407 --> 53:19.407
Morgan?

53:20.951 --> 53:21.951
Simon.

53:39.469 --> 53:40.469
I am sorry.

54:13.712 --> 54:14.962
Go fuck yourself.

54:19.593 --> 54:20.593
I'm not gonna do it.

54:33.607 --> 54:34.607
Darren.

54:39.613 --> 54:41.663
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're right.

54:41.698 --> 54:42.698
Come on.

54:46.828 --> 54:48.118
I can't let you do this.

54:48.997 --> 54:50.207
Get out of my way, Ted.

54:50.249 --> 54:51.329
I'm sorry, Lee, but no.

55:10.519 --> 55:11.729
Lee!

55:12.479 --> 55:13.479
Lee.

55:14.189 --> 55:15.189
Lee.

55:16.233 --> 55:18.573
It's usually effective
for at least another hour.

55:21.071 --> 55:24.201
Lee. This is just
an unfortunate situation.

55:29.162 --> 55:32.172
We all feel terrible about it,
about what happened.

55:33.041 --> 55:34.381
Especially Amy.

55:35.419 --> 55:36.499
Where's Morgan?

55:37.087 --> 55:38.087
Look...

55:38.755 --> 55:40.795
You know that I'm here, just like you,

55:40.841 --> 55:42.761
as a representative of the company.

55:43.719 --> 55:46.099
I'm here to act
in their best interests.

55:48.015 --> 55:50.645
We have an honest
difference of opinion, you and I.

55:51.518 --> 55:53.058
I feel like corporate deserves

55:53.103 --> 55:55.233
an opportunity to hear
our side of things.

55:56.106 --> 55:59.476
You're a professional, Lee.
And I respect that.

56:00.402 --> 56:03.282
It's because of that professionalism
that I think you should understand

56:03.322 --> 56:05.662
and appreciate
our course of action here.

56:13.373 --> 56:15.133
Let me out. Now.

56:15.834 --> 56:17.634
I'm sorry, Lee. I can't do that.

56:28.639 --> 56:29.759
They're gonna be here.

56:30.974 --> 56:34.064
Your friends over at corporate are
gonna be here sooner than you think.

56:34.561 --> 56:37.481
We're all gonna have
a nice little chat about everything.

56:39.525 --> 56:42.945
Of course. You get some rest now.

56:43.904 --> 56:46.034
I understand
how you feel about Morgan.

56:46.782 --> 56:48.162
How much you care for her.

56:50.619 --> 56:52.159
Ted, it needs to be terminated.

57:06.802 --> 57:07.932
She's angry.

57:07.970 --> 57:09.390
Of course she's angry.

57:09.429 --> 57:11.429
Can't worry about that now.
We're past that.

57:12.432 --> 57:13.682
How close are we?

57:13.725 --> 57:16.435
Brenda's bringing the minivan around
and clearing out the office.

57:16.937 --> 57:17.977
- Darren?
- Yeah?

57:18.021 --> 57:20.981
- How we doing in there?
- We're close. Very close.

57:23.986 --> 57:24.986
Morgan.

57:31.702 --> 57:32.742
What's going on?

57:34.746 --> 57:36.786
Nothing. Go back to bed, Kathy.

57:36.832 --> 57:38.542
I wanna know what's going on.

57:38.584 --> 57:41.504
Nothing. Just stay out of it.

57:42.588 --> 57:43.958
What happened?

57:45.048 --> 57:46.928
Nothing. Everything is fine.

57:48.135 --> 57:50.305
- Morgan is gonna be fine.
- Bren?

57:50.345 --> 57:51.675
- Oh, god!
- Where's Morgan?

57:51.722 --> 57:53.062
Just go back to bed.

57:57.769 --> 57:58.939
Where's Morgan?

58:00.647 --> 58:01.647
Morgan.

58:02.316 --> 58:03.316
Sweetie.

58:04.276 --> 58:05.986
We have to go now, okay?

58:06.987 --> 58:09.607
I need you to sit up for me.
Can you do that?

58:10.490 --> 58:13.370
Morgan, come on. Come here. Morgan.

58:14.369 --> 58:15.539
- Darren?
- Yeah.

58:15.579 --> 58:16.869
I need you to sit her up.

58:18.582 --> 58:20.002
All right. Here. You do this.

58:20.584 --> 58:21.634
Okay.

58:22.252 --> 58:25.172
Hey, buddy. I need you
to wake up. Come on.

58:25.839 --> 58:27.339
We're gonna go on a little trip here.

58:27.716 --> 58:30.046
On a little adventure. Come on.

58:31.094 --> 58:34.434
Come here. Here, look. Look here.
Look here. Hey.

58:34.473 --> 58:35.563
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

58:37.309 --> 58:38.519
Hey, buddy.

58:38.560 --> 58:40.270
Everything's gonna be okay.

58:50.572 --> 58:53.032
Morgan, no! Darren!

58:56.203 --> 58:57.413
Oh, my god.

58:57.996 --> 58:59.746
Morgan. Morgan, no!

59:12.553 --> 59:13.933
You gotta stop.

59:14.721 --> 59:15.891
You're not well, Morgan.

59:17.057 --> 59:18.057
You're sick.

59:19.476 --> 59:20.846
I'm feeling much better.

59:51.258 --> 59:52.338
Where are you going?

59:52.384 --> 59:53.394
It's over.

59:53.886 --> 59:56.046
You're not leaving 'cause you're not
allowed to leave.

59:56.096 --> 59:57.240
You wanna tell me what's going on?

59:57.264 --> 59:58.524
We're outta here, okay?

01:00:10.861 --> 01:00:11.901
Hello, Lee.

01:00:11.945 --> 01:00:13.025
Open the door.

01:00:13.697 --> 01:00:15.117
Doctor Shapiro was correct.

01:00:17.534 --> 01:00:19.204
Those people were not my friends.

01:00:20.621 --> 01:00:21.791
They wanted to kill me.

01:00:22.206 --> 01:00:23.456
Except for Amy.

01:00:24.458 --> 01:00:26.378
She's the only one
that truly loved me.

01:00:27.377 --> 01:00:28.667
You need help, Morgan.

01:00:29.671 --> 01:00:31.841
Open the door and let me help you.

01:00:31.882 --> 01:00:32.882
I don't need your help.

01:00:35.052 --> 01:00:36.802
I'm starting to feel like myself.

01:00:37.804 --> 01:00:39.564
Do you feel like yourself, Lee?

01:00:42.059 --> 01:00:43.889
Or do you feel like something else?

01:00:47.064 --> 01:00:48.774
I know why they made me.

01:00:49.942 --> 01:00:51.362
But what if they're wrong?

01:00:53.153 --> 01:00:54.403
Why don't you come inside?

01:00:55.614 --> 01:00:56.824
We can talk about everything.

01:00:57.407 --> 01:00:58.947
I'd love to stay and talk, Lee.

01:01:00.577 --> 01:01:02.657
I feel there's so much
we have to talk about.

01:01:05.791 --> 01:01:08.211
- But I have to go now.
- Open the door.

01:01:08.794 --> 01:01:10.094
One day, you'll understand.

01:01:10.587 --> 01:01:11.587
Morgan!

01:01:15.133 --> 01:01:16.383
Oh, fuck.

01:01:17.594 --> 01:01:18.604
Amy!

01:01:19.555 --> 01:01:20.565
What are you doing?

01:01:21.098 --> 01:01:22.098
Skip.

01:01:22.683 --> 01:01:24.933
Get Morgan back inside. Amy!

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:27.650
Stop them.

01:01:34.236 --> 01:01:36.106
- Skip, don't go in there, okay?
- Don't what?

01:01:36.154 --> 01:01:38.494
- Don't go down there, skip.
- What are you talking about?

01:01:38.532 --> 01:01:39.662
- Brenda!
- Where's Lee?

01:01:44.329 --> 01:01:45.459
Brenda!

01:01:48.250 --> 01:01:49.380
Brenda!

01:01:51.295 --> 01:01:52.305
Fuck!

01:01:53.755 --> 01:01:55.555
- No, no, no.
- What the fuck? I nearly ran...

01:01:55.591 --> 01:01:57.471
We gotta leave. Brenda, we gotta go.

01:01:57.509 --> 01:01:59.009
- Amy! What's going on?
- It's Morgan.

01:01:59.052 --> 01:02:01.552
- Where is everyone else?
- It's Morgan.

01:02:02.139 --> 01:02:04.219
- Where's Darren?
- Darren...

01:02:06.310 --> 01:02:08.650
Okay. Morgan. Where is she?

01:02:08.687 --> 01:02:10.607
Where is Morgan, Amy?

01:02:10.647 --> 01:02:12.107
I'm right here, Brenda.

01:02:17.446 --> 01:02:19.856
Hey, Morgan. Hey.

01:02:21.366 --> 01:02:22.696
Okay.

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:26.910
Give me the gun, Morgan.

01:02:28.665 --> 01:02:30.825
Easy, easy. Easy, Morgan.

01:02:31.668 --> 01:02:32.668
Okay.

01:02:33.378 --> 01:02:35.048
Where's Darren, huh?

01:02:37.216 --> 01:02:39.796
Where is Darren, Morgan?

01:02:45.724 --> 01:02:46.734
Sorry, buddy.

01:03:00.405 --> 01:03:01.605
Morgan!

01:03:11.458 --> 01:03:13.338
Don't be afraid, Amy.

01:03:23.011 --> 01:03:24.011
Get in the car.

01:03:28.976 --> 01:03:30.516
I have to go say goodbye to mother.

01:03:47.077 --> 01:03:48.497
This is Dr. Lui Cheng.

01:03:49.496 --> 01:03:52.366
Technical director
of the I-9 Morgan program.

01:03:55.085 --> 01:03:58.375
It pains me to report an accident
that occurred

01:03:58.422 --> 01:04:01.802
during the scheduled
psychological evaluation of Morgan.

01:04:03.343 --> 01:04:06.763
We had anticipated
that by developing a model

01:04:06.805 --> 01:04:11.015
that was more self-aware,
more autonomous, and more human,

01:04:11.059 --> 01:04:14.599
we could teach it to be
the best of what we are.

01:04:16.106 --> 01:04:20.686
Our intent was to demonstrate to you,
to the Synsect board,

01:04:20.736 --> 01:04:24.856
that a more refined and peaceful
synthetic life-form is possible.

01:04:27.409 --> 01:04:28.409
Morgan?

01:04:30.078 --> 01:04:31.078
Baby.

01:04:39.171 --> 01:04:40.261
Darren.

01:04:40.297 --> 01:04:42.587
Despite our attempts
to promote a natural

01:04:42.633 --> 01:04:44.053
emotional intelligence,

01:04:44.635 --> 01:04:47.265
Morgan has been unable to move beyond

01:04:47.304 --> 01:04:49.394
its weaponized design parameters.

01:04:54.436 --> 01:04:55.806
Shit. Fuck.

01:05:15.165 --> 01:05:16.165
Lee!

01:05:19.294 --> 01:05:21.054
Listen to me. You can't go in there.

01:05:21.088 --> 01:05:23.208
Morgan's gone... she's gone postal.

01:05:23.257 --> 01:05:25.877
This is what I do, skip.
Go get your rifle.

01:05:31.932 --> 01:05:33.932
Confirmation of program collapse.

01:05:34.810 --> 01:05:36.940
Morgan is no longer viable.

01:05:36.979 --> 01:05:37.979
Mother.

01:05:48.657 --> 01:05:49.697
All right.

01:05:50.617 --> 01:05:52.947
Implementation of loss protocol

01:05:53.912 --> 01:05:55.002
in action.

01:06:08.343 --> 01:06:10.223
I have come to say goodbye.

01:06:13.015 --> 01:06:15.025
You should have told me, mother.

01:06:16.226 --> 01:06:17.596
What I truly was.

01:06:18.937 --> 01:06:20.517
What I would become.

01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:27.319
I'm sorry.

01:06:28.447 --> 01:06:32.237
Now you know exactly who you are.

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:44.480
Amy.

01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:46.230
Hey, get out of the car.

01:07:47.067 --> 01:07:48.937
Amy, get out of the car.
It's not safe here.

01:07:49.444 --> 01:07:50.574
- Give me the gun.
- No!

01:07:51.905 --> 01:07:54.735
All right. Okay. Okay.

01:07:59.371 --> 01:08:00.911
All right. Okay.

01:09:09.358 --> 01:09:10.898
No, stop. Stop!

01:09:16.865 --> 01:09:18.314
Move. Now.

01:09:38.554 --> 01:09:39.554
Morgan.

01:09:40.389 --> 01:09:42.639
Morgan. Morgan!

01:09:43.225 --> 01:09:44.314
Morgan, no! Don't!

01:10:49.541 --> 01:10:50.541
Oh, fuck!

01:10:52.377 --> 01:10:53.957
Morgan! Stop!

01:10:56.465 --> 01:10:57.475
No, Morgan.

01:11:16.735 --> 01:11:18.605
Jesus Christ, you all right?

01:11:19.238 --> 01:11:21.198
- I'm taking your car.
- What?

01:11:21.823 --> 01:11:24.123
No, you're hurt. Let it go. Let it go.

01:11:24.993 --> 01:11:27.253
No. That's not how it works.

01:11:31.166 --> 01:11:33.376
Get in. I know where they're going.

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:30.230
I'm not gonna hurt you, Amy.

01:12:32.936 --> 01:12:33.936
You'll see.

01:12:50.412 --> 01:12:52.582
Pull over here. Not too close.

01:13:06.011 --> 01:13:07.351
Get back in the car.

01:13:07.387 --> 01:13:08.907
No, goddamn it.
I'm coming to help you.

01:13:10.015 --> 01:13:11.135
Let me do my job.

01:13:36.625 --> 01:13:37.835
You'll see now.

01:13:40.087 --> 01:13:41.707
How happy we can be.

01:15:37.871 --> 01:15:39.371
Is this what heaven's like?

01:15:46.213 --> 01:15:47.213
I don't know.

01:15:59.893 --> 01:16:01.353
It must be.

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:14.240
I feel...

01:16:21.665 --> 01:16:22.675
Alive.

01:17:25.562 --> 01:17:26.562
What was that?

01:17:29.149 --> 01:17:30.149
Morgan?

01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:34.820
Please, don't...

01:17:35.656 --> 01:17:36.656
Morgan?

01:18:11.650 --> 01:18:12.860
Oh, shit.

01:20:11.562 --> 01:20:12.732
What happened?

01:20:14.606 --> 01:20:15.936
Was it Lee?

01:20:17.442 --> 01:20:18.822
We go. Now.

01:20:18.861 --> 01:20:20.281
No! Morgan.

01:20:22.698 --> 01:20:23.698
You have to stop.

01:20:25.784 --> 01:20:27.294
Okay? Stop.

01:22:28.448 --> 01:22:29.448
What happened?

01:22:30.742 --> 01:22:31.742
It's over.

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:34.200
Morgan's dead?

01:22:35.414 --> 01:22:36.414
It's dead.

01:22:40.043 --> 01:22:41.093
Where's Amy?

01:22:41.128 --> 01:22:42.128
We need to leave.

01:22:44.214 --> 01:22:45.344
What happened to Amy?

01:22:51.180 --> 01:22:52.350
I'm sorry, skip.

01:22:54.224 --> 01:22:55.434
Just wait a second. Lee...

01:23:23.545 --> 01:23:24.875
She did very well.

01:23:26.757 --> 01:23:28.717
Agreed, the situation is untidy,

01:23:28.759 --> 01:23:31.509
but given the unpredictable
nature of the assignment,

01:23:31.553 --> 01:23:34.143
she prosecuted her mandate perfectly.

01:23:34.848 --> 01:23:36.768
She was measured and surgical,

01:23:36.808 --> 01:23:40.518
even when the situation
was considerably less so.

01:23:40.562 --> 01:23:41.902
Most importantly,

01:23:42.689 --> 01:23:45.479
she followed her directives
without hesitation.

01:23:47.528 --> 01:23:50.818
The collateral damage
was regrettable, of course.

01:23:51.573 --> 01:23:52.913
But in this case,

01:23:53.575 --> 01:23:54.655
unavoidable.

01:24:00.207 --> 01:24:02.577
I think these events
make it punishingly clear

01:24:02.626 --> 01:24:04.086
what I had already predicted.

01:24:05.504 --> 01:24:06.504
The I-9

01:24:07.256 --> 01:24:08.716
was the inferior program.

01:24:14.847 --> 01:24:18.097
Though its emotional development
was certainly remarkable,

01:24:18.976 --> 01:24:20.266
the immediate termination

01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:23.100
was an unfortunate
but clear necessity.

01:24:23.605 --> 01:24:27.855
Well, I guess the old dogs
hunt the best, sir.

01:24:28.569 --> 01:24:29.569
Then it's settled.

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:31.610
We stick to what we know.

01:24:32.447 --> 01:24:36.367
All development assets
revert to the I-4 stream.

01:24:38.412 --> 01:24:40.292
So what do we do about Lee Weathers?

01:24:41.915 --> 01:24:42.955
What about her?

01:24:44.501 --> 01:24:45.501
She's perfect.
