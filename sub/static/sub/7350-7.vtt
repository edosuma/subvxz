WEBVTT

00:05.139 --> 00:06.807
MAN:
Rise and shine, New Orleans.
Monday morning.

00:06.840 --> 00:09.543
Where you at?
Probably stuck in traffic.

00:09.577 --> 00:12.046
So be careful today,
be patient, because we all know

00:12.080 --> 00:14.615
as bad as the gridlock is,
some of the drivers are worse.

00:35.736 --> 00:38.272
Someone call 911!

00:40.141 --> 00:42.676
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

00:42.710 --> 00:45.313
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

00:45.346 --> 00:47.615
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

00:47.648 --> 00:49.117
* How, how, how, how

00:49.150 --> 00:51.485
* Hey, hey

00:57.325 --> 00:58.692
* You gotta come on.

01:01.229 --> 01:03.197
That's a beaut.

01:03.231 --> 01:04.832
PRIDE:
Yes, it is.

01:06.734 --> 01:10.338
First car I bought Linda
after we got married.

01:10.371 --> 01:12.673
Been sitting in the garage.

01:12.706 --> 01:15.376
Had it towed over
this morning.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.410
What's the problem?

01:16.444 --> 01:18.346
Well, you know,
marriage.

01:18.379 --> 01:20.381
Hard enough as it is,
and then...

01:20.414 --> 01:22.616
when you're not living
in the house...

01:22.650 --> 01:24.218
You meant the car, didn't you?

01:24.252 --> 01:25.653
You want to know what's wrong
with the car?

01:25.686 --> 01:28.756
You know I'm always here
for you, King.
Yeah.

01:28.789 --> 01:30.191
Engine won't turn over.

01:30.224 --> 01:32.193
Promised I'd get it fixed.

01:32.226 --> 01:33.361
Know what you're doing?

01:33.394 --> 01:34.595
Absolutely.

01:34.628 --> 01:36.130
Try the key.

01:40.634 --> 01:41.602
Say when.

01:41.635 --> 01:42.670
Go.

01:44.305 --> 01:45.306
Hang on.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.377
All right, give it a go.

01:52.280 --> 01:53.614
That's enough!

01:54.648 --> 01:56.650
You know, I got
a mechanic

01:56.684 --> 01:59.220
that fixed my sister's car
when no one else could.

01:59.253 --> 02:01.655
You want his number?
I got this.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.224
Dead Navy officer
in the Quarter.

02:03.257 --> 02:04.758
Car was run off the road.

02:04.792 --> 02:07.228
All right,
let's get to it.

02:07.261 --> 02:08.696
What's with the car?
It's Linda's.

02:08.729 --> 02:10.731
What's the problem?

02:10.764 --> 02:12.866
Well, you know, King's not
living at home anymore.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.735
The car, Christopher.

02:14.768 --> 02:15.836
She also means

02:15.869 --> 02:17.171
the car.

02:20.208 --> 02:23.577
According to witnesses,
we've got two cars speeding

02:23.611 --> 02:25.813
down Conti at 9:30 this morning.

02:25.846 --> 02:28.582
Sedan traded paint with an SUV,

02:28.616 --> 02:30.584
forced it into this
construction site.

02:30.618 --> 02:31.885
Victim died
on impact.

02:31.919 --> 02:33.554
So, what, road rage?

02:33.587 --> 02:34.855
Something like that.

02:34.888 --> 02:37.391
Got plates on the sedan?

02:37.425 --> 02:38.659
Witnesses say
there weren't any.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.261
Just tinted
windows, black car,

02:40.294 --> 02:41.595
big dent in
the bumper.

02:41.629 --> 02:42.463
Morning, Loretta.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.665
No matter how quiet
and gentle the soul,

02:44.698 --> 02:46.867
you get 'em behind a wheel
and suddenly they revert

02:46.900 --> 02:48.502
to the most base
and primal.

02:48.536 --> 02:50.571
I know. I've
driven with you.

02:50.604 --> 02:53.774
Okay. From the driver's license.

02:53.807 --> 02:57.245
The deceased is
Commander Darby Wilson.

02:59.247 --> 03:00.914
Worked at the Office
of Naval Research.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.450
Local guy.

03:02.483 --> 03:03.784
Born and raised
in Metairie.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.486
We could play
Guess the Cause of Death,

03:05.519 --> 03:06.887
but the giant rebar

03:06.920 --> 03:09.457
sticking
through our victim's chest

03:09.490 --> 03:10.724
makes the game
kind of pointless.

03:11.959 --> 03:14.695
They put out the
flames fairly quickly.

03:14.728 --> 03:17.331
Luckily, the corpse
is mostly intact.

03:20.701 --> 03:21.869
PRIDE:
What do we got here?

03:26.574 --> 03:27.941
Receipt says
it was purchased last night.

03:27.975 --> 03:30.311
6:12 p.m.

03:30.344 --> 03:31.612
LASALLE:
I never understood
the appeal

03:31.645 --> 03:34.014
of jewelry.
Expensive, easy to lose,

03:34.047 --> 03:36.850
and doesn't do anything but
just sit on your body.

03:36.884 --> 03:39.287
Says the perennial bachelor.

03:39.320 --> 03:42.290
My mother had a locket
with my father's picture from...

03:42.323 --> 03:44.892
when he was in boot camp
before Vietnam.

03:44.925 --> 03:47.861
The point of a locket
isn't the jewelry itself.

03:47.895 --> 03:50.864
It's what the giver chooses
to put inside.

03:54.902 --> 03:57.538
To be determined.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.540
I'll put a BOLO out
on that sedan.

03:59.573 --> 04:00.874
See if any
surveillance cameras get us

04:00.908 --> 04:01.909
a better look
at the driver.

04:01.942 --> 04:02.943
Something else, Dwayne.

04:04.044 --> 04:06.480
He's got bare feet.

04:06.514 --> 04:07.815
His shoes are nowhere
in the car.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.384
LASALLE:
Who gets in a car

04:10.418 --> 04:12.019
without shoes?

04:12.052 --> 04:13.421
Someone in a rush.

04:14.955 --> 04:17.791
Let's assume
that whatever ended here

04:17.825 --> 04:19.593
started somewhere else.

04:19.627 --> 04:22.630
Where the hell
was he coming from?

04:24.398 --> 04:25.633
PRIDE:
Got a GPS.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.436
LASALLE:
Which means...

04:30.504 --> 04:32.473
...I can do my thing.

04:32.506 --> 04:36.477
39163 Delgado Avenue.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.312
PRIDE:
Commander Wilson's house?

04:38.346 --> 04:40.581
LASALLE:
Matches the address
on his license.

04:43.517 --> 04:44.952
Hey, listen to this.

04:44.985 --> 04:48.622
Wilson was 40 years old,
already made commander.

04:48.656 --> 04:51.359
Tours in Iraq, Afghanistan.
Numerous commendations.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.394
And he could be dead
'cause someone couldn't handle

04:53.427 --> 04:55.596
getting cut off
in traffic.
Hey.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.739
On my lead.

05:09.577 --> 05:11.479
NCIS!

05:27.995 --> 05:29.863
Clear.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.500
Chris.

05:57.991 --> 06:02.463
So it's not likely this has
anything to do with road rage.

06:04.432 --> 06:07.134
Nope. Something
much bigger going on.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.413
Busy morning.

06:19.447 --> 06:20.648
You're telling me.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.683
We got any more
on our victim?

06:22.716 --> 06:23.984
Our first victim?
Yeah.

06:24.017 --> 06:25.619
Commander Wilson's assignment
with the Office

06:25.653 --> 06:26.920
of Naval Research
had him working

06:26.954 --> 06:29.923
as a technical liaison
for private developers.

06:29.957 --> 06:31.825
Special access,
top secret clearance.

06:31.859 --> 06:33.861
Take his computer. Call in...
Patton Plame.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.463
I'll get him
to run a diagnostic.

06:35.496 --> 06:37.130
And our second victim.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.667
She's, what,
Commander Wilson's wife?

06:39.700 --> 06:40.934
That would be a no.

06:40.968 --> 06:42.870
This is Commander Wilson's wife.

06:44.872 --> 06:47.841
Katherine Wilson.
The naked woman in the bathroom

06:47.875 --> 06:49.076
is Rebecca Ortega.

06:49.109 --> 06:51.078
She's Wilson's assistant
at the ONR.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.980
Found her purse
in the kitchen.

06:55.115 --> 06:58.552
One gunshot to the head,
one to the neck.

06:58.586 --> 07:00.888
Clean entry wounds.
My guess-- nine-millimeter.

07:00.921 --> 07:01.889
Time of death?

07:01.922 --> 07:04.792
Based on rigor, 9:00, 9:15.

07:04.825 --> 07:07.094
Less than 15 minutes
before Commander Wilson dies

07:07.127 --> 07:08.862
in the crash.

07:08.896 --> 07:11.899
Who else finds it odd that
an assistant is taking a bath

07:11.932 --> 07:14.034
at her boss's house
at 9:00 in the morning?

07:14.067 --> 07:15.769
PRIDE:
And if the
commander's wife knew

07:15.803 --> 07:18.606
what was going on,
wonder how she'd react.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.809
Before I forget,

07:21.842 --> 07:23.911
it's the number to the
mechanic I told you about.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.646
No, thanks. I'm good.

07:25.679 --> 07:28.949
I'm telling you, King, this
guy can get a turtle to run.

07:28.982 --> 07:31.885
And I'm telling you
I got this, Christopher.

07:33.921 --> 07:36.724
Bart Roberts.
He lives next door.

07:36.757 --> 07:39.092
Tell Agent Pride here about
Commander Wilson and his wife.

07:39.126 --> 07:42.963
Well, that was a couple
that just loved to argue.

07:42.996 --> 07:45.899
Bart says
that Wilson's assistant Rebecca

07:45.933 --> 07:48.068
spent some late nights here.

07:48.101 --> 07:49.236
They in a relationship?

07:49.269 --> 07:52.239
Well, I can't say that for sure,

07:52.272 --> 07:54.508
but alls I will say is...

07:54.542 --> 07:56.510
I would've tapped that.

07:59.012 --> 08:01.682
I mean, God rest her soul
and all that.

08:02.550 --> 08:04.585
You have a good day now.

08:04.618 --> 08:08.021
So, we've got a marriage
on the rocks,

08:08.055 --> 08:10.724
husband seems to be
having an affair.

08:10.758 --> 08:12.660
Disgruntled wife shoots
husband's lover

08:12.693 --> 08:14.227
and then runs him
off the road.

08:14.261 --> 08:15.829
Or gets someone else to.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.297
See this blood?
It came off a shoe.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.299
I sprayed it with BlueStar.
Look at the size.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.069
Big. Not a woman's.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.771
It wasn't from the commander.
He was barefoot.

08:23.804 --> 08:25.839
I found some more blood spots
in the hall, too.

08:25.873 --> 08:26.974
Shoe prints match.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.943
So, wife gets someone
to do the deed.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.981
He shoots Rebecca
in the bathroom,

08:34.014 --> 08:35.248
but the commander
was able to escape,

08:35.282 --> 08:36.884
flees the house.

08:36.917 --> 08:39.119
Bad guy follows,
gets to the car,

08:39.152 --> 08:40.954
ends in a crash.

08:40.988 --> 08:42.956
All right.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.958
Start with the wife's
personal assets.

08:44.992 --> 08:49.630
See if she had the finances
to pay someone to do this.

08:49.663 --> 08:52.633
$20,000 withdrawn from
Katherine Wilson's bank account

08:52.666 --> 08:54.334
48 hours ago.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.269
Enough to get you a hired gun.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.307
Hey, King,

09:00.340 --> 09:03.076
who are the uniforms?

09:03.110 --> 09:06.046
Intelligence specialists
out of Belle Chasse.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.716
Revamp on their HQ
just started.

09:08.749 --> 09:09.883
Until it's done,
I told them

09:09.917 --> 09:12.052
they could have
offices in the back.

09:13.687 --> 09:15.288
LASALLE:
By the way, got a response

09:15.322 --> 09:16.356
from the Office
of Naval Research.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.825
"Given the access

09:17.858 --> 09:19.192
"the commander had,
we are concerned

09:19.226 --> 09:21.128
"about the sensitive information

09:21.161 --> 09:23.063
that might have been
taken off his home computer."

09:23.096 --> 09:24.665
If they're concerned,

09:24.698 --> 09:26.299
I want to know
who they're concerned about.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.035
You two go to ONR.

09:28.068 --> 09:31.071
I'll talk to the $20,000 wife.

09:31.104 --> 09:33.373
You looked into my bank records?

09:33.406 --> 09:35.809
We did.

09:35.843 --> 09:38.078
Mind explaining why...

09:38.111 --> 09:40.380
you withdrew
$20,000 last week?

09:40.413 --> 09:43.917
My husband is dead,
and you're questioning...

09:43.951 --> 09:45.986
my finances?

09:46.019 --> 09:49.089
We're required
to cover our bases, Mrs. Wilson.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.758
I didn't kill my husband.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.159
We were having issues, yes.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.995
I saw him yesterday
at the house

09:55.028 --> 09:57.164
to go over the terms
of our divorce.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.265
Was it contentious?

09:59.867 --> 10:01.368
It's divorce.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.236
And nothing more?

10:03.270 --> 10:04.304
Meaning?

10:04.337 --> 10:07.240
The other victim at the house,

10:07.274 --> 10:09.042
the woman who
was killed.

10:09.076 --> 10:13.046
Rebecca. Yes, I heard.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.382
She was there early
in the morning.

10:15.415 --> 10:18.018
Odd time for an assistant
to be with a boss.

10:18.051 --> 10:21.088
And...
there was this.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.625
In his car.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.129
Recognize it?

10:31.799 --> 10:34.802
Any idea who it was for?

10:34.835 --> 10:37.370
Not for me, it seems.

10:40.941 --> 10:43.276
Unless you'd like
to arrest me...

10:43.310 --> 10:46.279
I think I should
probably go start

10:46.313 --> 10:48.648
planning my husband's funeral.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.358
MAN:
We're... in shock.

10:58.391 --> 11:01.328
Commander Wilson
and Rebecca were...

11:01.361 --> 11:02.963
amazing people.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.065
Commander Wilson had...

11:05.098 --> 11:07.434
a bright future in the service.

11:07.467 --> 11:10.704
What kind of sensitive intel
was the commander privy to?

11:10.738 --> 11:12.873
Drones, missile defense,

11:12.906 --> 11:14.474
all the latest
technology.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.744
Any issues there
or breaches of intelligence

11:16.777 --> 11:18.145
with Commander Wilson?

11:18.178 --> 11:19.913
Well, I'd love
to talk specifics,

11:19.947 --> 11:21.982
but that information's
classified.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.984
Is there anything
you could offer us?

11:24.017 --> 11:26.186
Darby and Rebecca spent
much of the past year on-site

11:26.219 --> 11:27.855
with a private
defense contractor.

11:27.888 --> 11:30.023
Uh, Axelrod Industries.

11:30.057 --> 11:32.159
If there were issues,
they'd be someone

11:32.192 --> 11:33.393
you should talk to.

11:33.426 --> 11:35.162
One other question.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.731
Did you get a sense
that Commander Wilson

11:37.765 --> 11:40.200
and Ms. Ortega's relationship
extended beyond work?

11:40.233 --> 11:44.137
Um, excuse me. The admiral's
requesting your signature.

11:44.171 --> 11:47.007
Darby and Rebecca
were close, but...

11:47.040 --> 11:49.042
given our strict
disclosure policies,

11:49.076 --> 11:51.344
they'd have to come to us
with a relationship.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.513
Or keep it an office secret.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.916
I suppose anything's
possible.

11:55.949 --> 11:58.251
LASALLE:
We're going to need
to bag and tag

11:58.285 --> 11:59.787
the files, the tablet,

11:59.820 --> 12:01.221
everything in the
commander's office.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.156
Excuse me.

12:03.190 --> 12:04.491
Miss?

12:06.059 --> 12:08.095
Special Agent Brody with NCIS.

12:08.128 --> 12:10.130
I was wondering
if there was something

12:10.163 --> 12:11.799
you might want to tell me.

12:11.832 --> 12:15.335
I... I don't.

12:15.368 --> 12:18.005
Just needed a signature
at that exact moment?

12:18.038 --> 12:19.907
Time

12:24.812 --> 12:27.414
There was nothing going on
between Darby and Rebecca.

12:27.447 --> 12:28.748
How do you know that?

12:30.250 --> 12:32.886
Because I'm the office secret.

12:32.920 --> 12:33.987
You and Darby?

12:35.989 --> 12:37.757
Me and Becca.

12:39.359 --> 12:42.529
Darby and Becca
were very close.

12:42.562 --> 12:45.465
They worked crazy
hours together.

12:45.498 --> 12:49.069
She slept there some
nights, but trust me...

12:51.238 --> 12:53.941
...Rebecca wasn't into him.

12:55.242 --> 12:57.444
:
I'm in so much pain.

12:59.913 --> 13:02.449
I mean, we were in love,
and now she's...

13:02.482 --> 13:04.484
she's...

13:06.319 --> 13:08.088
...gone.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.490
I'm so sorry for your loss.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.263
So there was
no affair?

13:16.296 --> 13:19.532
Which doesn't mean the wife
didn't think there was.

13:19.566 --> 13:22.602
And I'd like to know more
about that withdrawal.

13:22.635 --> 13:26.139
But she didn't strike me as
the kind of lady that would...

13:26.173 --> 13:28.341
bump off two people
on a hunch.

13:28.375 --> 13:30.343
Ah, speaking
of hunches--

13:30.377 --> 13:32.312
and I don't know
what this means--

13:32.345 --> 13:36.950
but I found a small patch
of a sticky substance

13:36.984 --> 13:40.320
on the commander's right wrist.

13:40.353 --> 13:41.488
Run any tests?

13:41.521 --> 13:44.324
The old-fashioned kind: smell.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.128
Tobacco?

13:48.161 --> 13:49.596
Mm-hmm. In resin form.

13:49.629 --> 13:51.564
Which is odd,
because the commander

13:51.598 --> 13:53.867
has the cleanest lungs
I've ever seen.

13:53.901 --> 13:55.402
Makes you wonder:

13:55.435 --> 14:00.340
Why is it there, and where
exactly did it come from?

14:00.373 --> 14:02.342
Sebastian's running
further tests on the resin

14:02.375 --> 14:04.044
so we could learn more.

14:04.077 --> 14:06.379
Nobody move.

14:06.413 --> 14:08.248
Speaking of...

14:08.281 --> 14:11.051
Hotter.

14:11.084 --> 14:12.385
Hotter.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.955
That's colder.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.356
What are we doing?

14:16.389 --> 14:17.891
Trying to beat back
the prying eyes

14:17.925 --> 14:19.026
of our great overlords.

14:20.460 --> 14:21.962
Sebastian.

14:21.995 --> 14:24.297
Sorry. It's my
anti-hacking app.

14:24.331 --> 14:26.466
When someone tries to steal
information from my phone,

14:26.499 --> 14:28.401
the app starts beeping,
and it's telling me

14:28.435 --> 14:31.338
that the source of the hack
is somewhere in this room.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.073
Hotter.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.476
Hotter.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.946
Singeing.

14:41.081 --> 14:43.150
Inferno.

14:44.184 --> 14:45.518
Um...

14:45.552 --> 14:49.422
it's saying that the source
is inside the body.

14:50.457 --> 14:52.359
In the body?

14:53.460 --> 14:55.028
Yeah. Uh, there.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.563
Right... there.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.507
I was just
about to check

15:07.540 --> 15:09.909
the contents of the
stomach anyway.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.518
Oh.

15:18.551 --> 15:22.189
Something's imbedded
in the stomach lining.

15:26.526 --> 15:29.229
Looks like a microchip.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.498
May I see that
for a second?

15:34.434 --> 15:36.503
SEBASTIAN:
Oh, wow.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.338
Seriously,
like, wow.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.540
I-I had heard this kind
of thing was in development,

15:40.573 --> 15:43.710
but to actually see one... Wow.

15:43.743 --> 15:46.079
See one what, Sebastian?

15:46.113 --> 15:48.115
Uh, a biotracker.

15:48.148 --> 15:51.084
It's a spy tool--
something that you put
inside another person.

15:51.118 --> 15:53.653
And then when that person
is near an electronic signal,

15:53.686 --> 15:57.590
like a computer or a phone, the
biotracker steals that signal.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.427
Phone calls are tapped,
e-mails are hijacked.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.196
Like swallowing
a recording device?

16:03.230 --> 16:06.466
Yeah.
So what you're saying...

16:06.499 --> 16:09.402
Commander Wilson
was being spied on?

16:09.436 --> 16:12.405
I am saying that Commander
Wilson was being spied on...

16:12.439 --> 16:15.642
from inside
his own body.

16:24.784 --> 16:27.520
Biotracker is the purest fusion
of biology and electronics.

16:27.554 --> 16:29.189
There's a whole branch of tech

16:29.222 --> 16:31.091
devoted to craziness
just like this.

16:31.124 --> 16:32.659
It's all the rage
with guys like me.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.094
Hackers like you.

16:34.127 --> 16:36.096
Investigative
computer specialists.

16:36.129 --> 16:37.497
Too legit to quit.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.599
Okay, MC Hammer,

16:39.632 --> 16:41.534
how do you get a
biotracker into someone?

16:41.568 --> 16:43.536
Well, as you can see,
they're very tiny.

16:43.570 --> 16:45.238
Normally,
they're hidden in a pill.

16:45.272 --> 16:48.141
Any chance he could have
swallowed it himself?

16:48.175 --> 16:49.609
Not unless
he's a crazy-ass.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.711
Those things are not tested;
they're dangerous.

16:51.744 --> 16:53.446
Commander Wilson was
on cholesterol meds.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.182
Maybe somebody slipped
the biotracker

16:55.215 --> 16:57.284
into one of those?
Uh...

16:57.317 --> 16:59.452
they might have planted trackers
in multiple pills.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.121
Like anything
other than...

17:01.154 --> 17:02.689
cheese, biotrackers can pass

17:02.722 --> 17:04.524
through your system within days.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.559
So the info
the biotracker steals

17:06.593 --> 17:10.063
can be transmitted somewhere--
can you track where it goes?
Nah.

17:10.097 --> 17:12.365
That's beyond
even my considerable powers.
But this is not

17:12.399 --> 17:14.234
something a jealous wife
would be using?

17:14.267 --> 17:15.535
Not unless she's a wife with

17:15.568 --> 17:17.137
multimillions
in research funding.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.472
The people who work with the ONR
have those resources.

17:19.506 --> 17:21.208
And the place
Wilson was assigned--

17:21.241 --> 17:24.144
Axelrod Industries.
I'll take Axelrod.

17:24.177 --> 17:26.146
You two figure out who,
other than his wife,

17:26.179 --> 17:27.814
had access to his meds.

17:27.847 --> 17:30.250
How you doing with
Wilson's computer?

17:30.283 --> 17:32.252
Oh, I'm into it.

17:32.285 --> 17:33.420
I'll tell you what,

17:33.453 --> 17:36.256
this puppy is buttoned up
tighter than a...

17:36.289 --> 17:37.624
very...

17:37.657 --> 17:39.159
tightly...

17:39.192 --> 17:40.660
buttoned-up puppy.

17:43.830 --> 17:46.065
Okay, I got lost
in the middle of that one.

17:49.536 --> 17:52.339
Agent Pride.
Welcome.

17:52.372 --> 17:54.474
Oscar Randolph,
head of security.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.809
Got to do this sweep.
My apologies.

17:56.843 --> 17:59.179
Understood.

17:59.212 --> 18:00.247
At this point,
we're trying to learn

18:00.280 --> 18:01.348
everything we can
about the work

18:01.381 --> 18:02.849
Commander Wilson
was involved in.

18:02.882 --> 18:04.551
Right. So, he was
the go-between

18:04.584 --> 18:07.187
on a number of projects we
were building for the Navy.

18:07.220 --> 18:09.189
Darby was charged
with helping us

18:09.222 --> 18:11.824
integrate the work into
the Navy's systems.

18:11.858 --> 18:13.760
Laser-based
helicopter landing aid,

18:13.793 --> 18:15.728
hypervelocity
missile system...

18:15.762 --> 18:17.197
How about biotrackers?

18:17.230 --> 18:19.332
Not on our radar.

18:19.366 --> 18:21.901
But they're cool.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.770
Agent Pride, do you
think they were killed

18:23.803 --> 18:25.272
because of Darby's
work here?

18:25.305 --> 18:26.873
We're exploring
all possibilities.

18:26.906 --> 18:28.875
You'd be right
to be concerned.

18:28.908 --> 18:31.244
My employees have had
issues in the past.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.546
Routine attempts
at hacking into our system,

18:33.580 --> 18:36.683
extortion, espionage...
Terrorist organizations?

18:36.716 --> 18:39.752
From al-Qaeda to the Red Hacker
Alliance out of Beijing.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.421
Our employees have targets
on their backs-- that's why

18:41.454 --> 18:43.223
we do everything in our power
to keep them safe.

18:43.256 --> 18:45.458
But the truth is,
the technologies we develop

18:45.492 --> 18:47.227
are the cutting edge.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.795
They're worth killing for--

18:48.828 --> 18:50.630
a fact we're,
admittedly,

18:50.663 --> 18:52.265
quite proud of.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.505
Here's my problem.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.673
It's hard to investigate
what's not there anymore.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.475
Darby's entire system
was wiped remotely

19:02.509 --> 19:04.244
three hours
after his death.

19:04.277 --> 19:05.545
So all gone?

19:05.578 --> 19:07.314
Gone, but not
really gone.

19:07.347 --> 19:09.249
See, gone is never
totally gone.

19:09.282 --> 19:10.450
I use some...

19:10.483 --> 19:12.452
complier code, maybe
a packet sniffer.

19:12.485 --> 19:13.786
If I'm lucky,

19:13.820 --> 19:15.622
I'll find a zero day exploit.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.457
And here's where
I pretend like I know

19:17.490 --> 19:18.825
what that means.
Oh, it means,

19:18.858 --> 19:20.393
I'm gonna be on it,

19:20.427 --> 19:22.329
like a woman on a bicycle,

19:22.362 --> 19:23.696
with somewhere to go.

19:23.730 --> 19:25.365
Analogies are
not your strong suit.

19:25.398 --> 19:26.733
LASALLE:
The lab wants us.

19:31.271 --> 19:33.473
SEBASTIAN:
Afternoon, friends.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.475
Mr. Lund.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.444
Mr. Plame.

19:37.477 --> 19:39.212
How's my favorite
conspiracy theorist doing?

19:39.246 --> 19:41.481
I prefer the term
"creative realist."

19:41.514 --> 19:43.883
Well, not many realists I know
believe that the government

19:43.916 --> 19:47.420
is developing time travel
technology in Area 51.

19:47.454 --> 19:48.888
Yeah, not many skeptics I know
have read

19:48.921 --> 19:50.390
the redacted files
that I have, so...

19:50.423 --> 19:52.259
There is a reason
you called?

19:52.292 --> 19:55.262
Yes. The substance
found on Wilson's wrist

19:55.295 --> 19:56.863
was, in fact, tobacco resin.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.865
SEBASTIAN: I isolated
the cotinine properties

19:58.898 --> 20:00.400
and found that
this particular type,

20:00.433 --> 20:01.901
the Roman Shisha,
is somewhat rare.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.836
It's also only used
for hookah smoking.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.372
It's only sold
in a few local spots.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.374
And the resin can be
wiped out quite easily,

20:07.407 --> 20:08.575
but it was still
on Commander Wilson,

20:08.608 --> 20:10.610
which means he likely
encountered it

20:10.643 --> 20:12.479
within hours
of his death.

20:12.512 --> 20:14.414
Yeah, so I grabbed the log
that Lasalle downloaded

20:14.447 --> 20:16.483
from the GPS
in Commander Wilson's car,

20:16.516 --> 20:19.252
and I cross-referenced it
with hookah bars in the city...

20:19.286 --> 20:21.888
And... boom-shaka.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.290
Boom what?

20:23.323 --> 20:24.391
Boom-shaka. I'm just...

20:24.424 --> 20:25.224
I'm working on catchphrases

20:25.258 --> 20:27.327
to punctuate
meaningful discoveries.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.396
And in this case,
that discovery would be...?

20:29.429 --> 20:31.398
That Commander Wilson parked
his car near a place called

20:31.431 --> 20:33.866
the Sahara Room at 10:00 p.m.
the night before he died.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.569
Late meeting in a hookah bar?

20:36.603 --> 20:39.406
By a nonsmoker.
Well, it ain't
time travel

20:39.439 --> 20:41.408
at Area 51, but still it's odd.

20:41.441 --> 20:42.875
Okay, I'm telling you
it's a real...

20:42.909 --> 20:45.044
And how this is all
connected with the world

20:45.077 --> 20:47.314
of biotrackers
and high technology?
I don't know,

20:47.347 --> 20:49.482
but it's worth looking
into. Sebastian.

20:49.516 --> 20:51.651
Yeah?
Send me the address
to that hookah bar.

20:51.684 --> 20:54.687
I got you.

20:54.721 --> 20:57.824
Surveillance camera
footage from Sahara East.

20:57.857 --> 21:00.059
Hostess says
Commander Wilson was there

21:00.092 --> 21:01.661
meeting this guy.

21:01.694 --> 21:04.564
They were having
an intense conversation.

21:04.597 --> 21:07.634
But hostess couldn't hear them,
'cause they were whispering.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.536
He looks like a
burnt marshmallow.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.804
Camera had an inch of
dust over the lens.

21:11.838 --> 21:14.574
Even Bruce is stumped.

21:15.675 --> 21:17.644
Think Bruce could fix the car?

21:17.677 --> 21:19.346
Only I call him Bruce.

21:19.379 --> 21:20.647
Pride ever consider
a mechanic?

21:20.680 --> 21:22.415
I asked. He said no.

21:22.449 --> 21:24.651
I don't get it. I've only
known Pride a couple months,

21:24.684 --> 21:27.554
but it seems like if he
wanted to get it fixed...
He wouldn't be

21:27.587 --> 21:29.889
snapping at me for giving him
the number of my mechanic.

21:29.922 --> 21:31.791
Incoming.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.528
Anything on
the surveillance video?

21:35.562 --> 21:37.730
Nope. No, sir. Nada.

21:37.764 --> 21:41.668
Question: When exactly did
Wilson meet our mystery man?

21:41.701 --> 21:45.472
Time stamp says the night
before the murder, 10:06 p.m.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.106
Wilson's wife mentioned
meeting her husband

21:47.139 --> 21:50.477
earlier that same day.

21:50.510 --> 21:51.611
Wonder if Wilson
told her anything

21:51.644 --> 21:52.679
about his other meeting.

21:52.712 --> 21:54.714
Never hurts to ask.

22:09.396 --> 22:11.731
*

22:27.514 --> 22:28.781
Christopher?

22:28.815 --> 22:30.650
LASALLE:
Hey, King, what you got?

22:30.683 --> 22:33.520
Christopher, I got the car
that chased Commander Wilson

22:33.553 --> 22:35.888
parked in front of
the wife's house.

22:37.724 --> 22:39.592
Gonna need backup.
LASALLE: On our way.

22:40.927 --> 22:42.629
NCIS.

22:56.576 --> 22:58.478
You okay?
Yeah.

22:58.511 --> 23:00.913
All right, stay here.

23:42.889 --> 23:44.557
You okay?

23:44.591 --> 23:47.026
I don't get any of this.

23:47.059 --> 23:50.663
The-the person
who murdered my husband

23:50.697 --> 23:52.164
is also coming after me?

23:52.198 --> 23:55.635
At the moment,
we're focused on the possibility

23:55.668 --> 23:58.505
that something about
your husband's work

23:58.538 --> 24:00.206
was the reason for his death.

24:00.239 --> 24:02.809
Is there anything
he might have

24:02.842 --> 24:05.812
told you or left at your house
or-or gave you to keep

24:05.845 --> 24:08.681
that could put you in danger?

24:08.715 --> 24:11.017
No. No, he hasn't been
to my house in weeks,

24:11.050 --> 24:13.452
and we don't really talk much.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.688
Certainly not
about his work.

24:15.722 --> 24:17.824
BOLO's out based on
Mrs. Wilson's description.

24:17.857 --> 24:21.093
Got eyes on the ground
and in the air.

24:21.127 --> 24:23.062
Don't worry, ma'am,
we'll find the guy.

24:23.095 --> 24:27.500
Katherine, I need you
to remember anything you can.

24:27.534 --> 24:29.536
Uh, it just happened
really fast.

24:29.569 --> 24:31.571
I mean, I'm trying. I...

24:33.139 --> 24:35.642
I came home, and...

24:35.675 --> 24:37.777
he was there.

24:39.712 --> 24:42.715
He grabbed me by my hair,
and he...

24:44.751 --> 24:47.253
Sorry.
PRIDE: It's all right.

24:47.286 --> 24:49.488
It's all right. You're safe now.

24:52.258 --> 24:55.862
Just one more question.
Okay.

24:55.895 --> 24:58.164
The last time
you saw your husband,

24:58.197 --> 25:01.701
did he mention anything
about meeting someone

25:01.734 --> 25:03.002
later in the day?

25:03.035 --> 25:04.704
Shang. He's this... I...

25:04.737 --> 25:07.239
Someone named Shang. He...

25:07.273 --> 25:08.775
said he was a colleague.

25:08.808 --> 25:09.942
All right, all right,

25:09.976 --> 25:11.844
that's good, that's good.

25:13.813 --> 25:15.081
Add Shang to the BOLO.

25:15.114 --> 25:16.783
And I'll talk to ONR.

25:16.816 --> 25:19.652
Cross-reference the name against
anyone Wilson worked with.

25:19.686 --> 25:22.254
Yeah. Two murders

25:22.288 --> 25:24.557
and an attempt
on Mrs. Wilson.

25:24.591 --> 25:26.859
I think it's time maybe
we move her to the safe house

25:26.893 --> 25:28.795
till the killer's
in custody.

25:28.828 --> 25:30.229
I'll set it up.

25:30.262 --> 25:32.064
Have Brody pack her a bag.

25:32.098 --> 25:34.100
You got it, King.

25:45.077 --> 25:48.047
You mind taking
a couple steps back?

25:48.080 --> 25:49.916
Just a precaution.

25:51.918 --> 25:54.621
I used to have a radio
like this growing up.

25:55.988 --> 25:59.826
Turn it up real loud
when my parents would argue.

25:59.859 --> 26:01.594
Mom drank too much,

26:01.628 --> 26:02.895
Dad yelled and the music
just made it easier.

26:09.736 --> 26:11.804
(high-pitched tone,
distorted speaker)

26:11.838 --> 26:14.573
* I know it's hard to love me
There.

26:15.642 --> 26:17.777
I love that song.

26:17.810 --> 26:21.848
* But you sure enough
did try... *

26:21.881 --> 26:24.016
Darby didn't like music.

26:25.985 --> 26:28.020
He was no-nonsense.
Always on point.

26:28.054 --> 26:32.091
Which, when
I met him, I loved.

26:32.124 --> 26:34.326
But time passes

26:34.360 --> 26:38.965
and the differences
you fell in love with just...

26:38.998 --> 26:41.000
oh, start to be differences.

26:42.802 --> 26:44.637
You're married.

26:44.671 --> 26:46.939
I am.

26:46.973 --> 26:48.875
You know what I'm talking about.

26:48.908 --> 26:50.042
Yeah, it's tough

26:50.076 --> 26:51.978
when things get broken.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.081
You hungry?

26:55.114 --> 26:58.184
Yeah, I don't think
I've eaten in days.

26:58.217 --> 27:00.252
We got...

27:00.286 --> 27:02.755
peanut butter,
rice, baked beans

27:02.789 --> 27:04.356
and a can of salsa.

27:04.390 --> 27:06.092
You can make a meal out of that?

27:06.125 --> 27:08.127
You don't know
who you're talking to.

27:10.196 --> 27:11.664
MAN:
Thanks, Brody.

27:11.698 --> 27:13.165
The intelligence
specialists--

27:13.199 --> 27:14.300
they took my potato salad,

27:14.333 --> 27:15.868
didn't even ask.

27:15.902 --> 27:17.136
Come on.

27:17.169 --> 27:18.838
Well, you don't
eat potato salad,

27:18.871 --> 27:21.040
I didn't eat it,
and King ain't here.

27:21.073 --> 27:22.441
That leaves us one option.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.110
We got thieves
in our midst.

27:24.143 --> 27:25.978
They made coffee.
That's nice.

27:27.246 --> 27:29.849
Whatever.

27:29.882 --> 27:32.451
Here we go.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.020
Meet Shang Lee.

27:34.053 --> 27:36.155
Commander Wilson's
colleague.

27:36.188 --> 27:37.990
Wilson's friend
from the hookah bar.

27:38.024 --> 27:39.826
Shang used to work
at Axelrod Industries--

27:39.859 --> 27:41.994
technology officer.

27:42.028 --> 27:44.230
Mr. Axelrod says
he fired Shang a year ago.

27:44.263 --> 27:46.365
Accused him of trying to sell
blueprints to a competitor.

27:46.398 --> 27:48.367
Could be what the
biotracker is about.

27:48.400 --> 27:51.237
An attempt to learn
what Wilson was working on

27:51.270 --> 27:53.806
at Axelrod so Shang
could resell it.

27:53.840 --> 27:55.307
Maybe Wilson finds out...

27:55.341 --> 27:56.475
Shang has to silence him.

27:56.508 --> 27:57.977
Where's Shang Lee now?

27:58.010 --> 27:59.245
Looks like he's in the wind.

27:59.278 --> 28:01.113
Well, let's find him.

28:01.147 --> 28:03.149
And whoever stole
my potato salad.

28:05.985 --> 28:07.286
There are billions
of galaxies out there.

28:07.319 --> 28:08.855
How can you not believe

28:08.888 --> 28:10.389
in the existence
of extraterrestrial life?

28:10.422 --> 28:12.859
I mean, there are billions of
opportunities for life to grow.

28:12.892 --> 28:14.293
Billions of...
Sebastian, I invited you

28:14.326 --> 28:16.328
to help me, not to say
"billions" a billion times.

28:16.362 --> 28:18.430
We just... We can't be
the only pebble in space

28:18.464 --> 28:21.100
whose inhabitants get their
celestial groove on, you know?

28:21.133 --> 28:22.802
Whose fish
swim upstream.

28:22.835 --> 28:24.303
Whose sole purpose

28:24.336 --> 28:27.173
is to procreate and continue
a dysfunctional species.

28:27.206 --> 28:29.208
Any progress
with Wilson's computer?

28:29.241 --> 28:32.011
We're getting there. Sebastian
actually had a decent thought.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.445
Potato salad.

28:33.479 --> 28:34.847
Want some?

28:34.881 --> 28:37.049
So, to get into

28:37.083 --> 28:38.818
encrypted Area 51 files,

28:38.851 --> 28:41.053
hackers used a neural
network decryption algorithm.

28:41.087 --> 28:43.322
Allegedly. Anyway,

28:43.355 --> 28:45.925
we applied the same
algorithm to the commander's

28:45.958 --> 28:47.426
computer and...
SEBASTIAN
Boom-a-bam-bam.

28:50.129 --> 28:52.231
Boom-diggidy.

28:52.264 --> 28:53.265
That's...

28:53.299 --> 28:54.266
Boom

28:54.300 --> 28:57.203
Don't ever say that again.

28:57.236 --> 28:59.271
All right.

28:59.305 --> 29:01.107
We got Commander Wilson's
download history.

29:01.140 --> 29:04.276
His last download was 8:30,
about an hour before he died.

29:04.310 --> 29:06.879
He put some files on an SD card.

29:06.913 --> 29:09.816
What was on the files?
We don't know yet-- a lot
of layers of encryption.

29:09.849 --> 29:12.451
Looked like some
classified stuff.

29:12.484 --> 29:14.153
But we're getting into it.

29:21.393 --> 29:23.062
Seconds?

29:23.095 --> 29:25.331
I got to admit, the
food's not terrible.

29:25.364 --> 29:27.834
High praise.

29:27.867 --> 29:29.201
What you got there?

29:31.470 --> 29:34.340
Found it in the cabinet.

29:34.373 --> 29:36.475
Thought this was a
secure safe house.

29:36.508 --> 29:38.444
We share it with
other agencies.

29:38.477 --> 29:40.246
Can't vouch for everyone.

29:40.279 --> 29:42.248
Is it okay if I...
You can.

29:42.281 --> 29:44.550
No. I'm the one with the gun.

29:44.583 --> 29:46.285
Got to take a pass.

29:55.494 --> 29:58.264
Darby took a cooking class once.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.299
He was so bad.

30:02.134 --> 30:04.436
I mean, he really tried.
It was sweet.

30:04.470 --> 30:06.973
He wanted to learn my favorite
food-- beef bourguignon--

30:07.006 --> 30:08.307
and cook it for my birthday.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.442
Sounds like a good guy.

30:10.476 --> 30:12.378
He was.

30:13.645 --> 30:16.448
I didn't want it to end.

30:16.482 --> 30:19.018
With Darby.

30:19.051 --> 30:21.120
The divorce was...

30:21.153 --> 30:23.155
all we could think to do.

30:26.225 --> 30:28.227
Couple weeks ago, I tried
signing up for an online

30:28.260 --> 30:30.429
dating service,

30:30.462 --> 30:35.067
but when I went
to complete the profile, I...

30:35.101 --> 30:37.870
couldn't do it.

30:37.904 --> 30:39.471
Somehow that step--

30:39.505 --> 30:41.874
more than the divorce, even--

30:41.908 --> 30:43.375
felt like...

30:43.409 --> 30:45.144
A line you...

30:45.177 --> 30:47.479
just can't uncross.

30:49.381 --> 30:51.250
You get it.

31:01.427 --> 31:03.095
Katherine.

31:03.129 --> 31:05.464
I...

31:09.668 --> 31:12.338
I need to deal with this.
Uh, yeah, of course.

31:18.044 --> 31:20.412
MAN:
One of the stable hands
found him.

31:20.446 --> 31:23.549
Was shoeing a horse,
noticed this horrible smell.

31:23.582 --> 31:26.518
Kind of like... spoiled cheese.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.420
Use these
stables much?

31:28.454 --> 31:30.189
Not in years.

31:30.222 --> 31:33.092
This is a great place to hide
something you don't want found.

31:33.125 --> 31:35.461
Thank you, sir.

31:35.494 --> 31:37.463
There's the smell.

31:37.496 --> 31:39.398
Definitely... spoiled cheese.

31:39.431 --> 31:41.233
Good afternoon, Loretta.

31:41.267 --> 31:43.702
Brody, Christopher, come
meet Shang Lee in the flesh.

31:43.735 --> 31:46.372
Rotting as it is.

31:49.408 --> 31:52.478
We found him submerged
in this trough of fetid water.

31:52.511 --> 31:55.381
Cause of death is
two gunshot wounds to the chest.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.549
Caliber appears to
be nine millimeter.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.551
Same weapon
that killed Rebecca Ortega.

31:59.585 --> 32:02.488
I'll have Sebastian check
ballistics, but I'm guessing...

32:02.521 --> 32:05.024
Striations match.

32:05.057 --> 32:07.059
Time of death?

32:07.093 --> 32:11.363
Based on decomp, bloating and
lividity, I'd say Shang Lee

32:11.397 --> 32:14.133
died hours before
the other two victims.

32:14.166 --> 32:16.302
Might want to call Pride.

32:16.335 --> 32:18.537
Tell him the killer's
still on the loose.

32:20.606 --> 32:23.642
Yeah. Well, do that.

32:25.611 --> 32:28.214
I take it that call doesn't
mean the danger's over?

32:29.615 --> 32:32.584
Not yet, no.

32:35.487 --> 32:37.256
Get down!

33:15.161 --> 33:17.196
KATHERINE:
So, what happens now?

33:17.229 --> 33:21.100
If... whoever it is...

33:21.133 --> 33:23.535
can find you out here
in the middle of nowhere,

33:23.569 --> 33:26.205
it's better we bring
you back to the office.

33:26.238 --> 33:27.406
More security.

33:27.439 --> 33:30.076
We'll keep you
under 24-hour watch.

33:30.742 --> 33:33.379
Listen, I'm...

33:33.412 --> 33:35.347
sorry about... before.

33:35.381 --> 33:38.184
Don't give it
another thought.

33:40.819 --> 33:43.122
Can I ask you a question?

33:44.323 --> 33:45.657
Where'd you get that bracelet?

33:45.691 --> 33:47.826
Darby, my 30th.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.128
Your earrings?

33:50.362 --> 33:52.498
Yeah, Darby, also.
All silver?

33:52.531 --> 33:54.500
It's the only kind
of jewelry I can wear

33:54.533 --> 33:56.302
without breaking into hives.

33:56.335 --> 33:58.537
That's what the
locket was made of.

34:00.506 --> 34:05.177
It clearly was
not for Rebecca.

34:05.211 --> 34:07.579
It matches everything
else you wear, and...

34:07.613 --> 34:09.648
You think he...
He bought it for you.

34:11.650 --> 34:14.286
And maybe

34:14.320 --> 34:17.089
it became the perfect
hiding place for something else.

34:19.191 --> 34:21.593
The only thing he took
as he ran for his life

34:21.627 --> 34:24.196
was the necklace.

34:26.365 --> 34:29.401
And an SD card
can be very small.

34:32.871 --> 34:34.740
LASALLE:
Pride says recheck the locket.

34:36.308 --> 34:38.310
I thought
he checked it at the scene.

34:38.344 --> 34:39.645
Nothing in here.

34:40.812 --> 34:42.748
How big is an SD card?

34:42.781 --> 34:44.783
Can be about the size
of your thumbnail.

34:44.816 --> 34:47.386
This thing's stuck.

34:47.419 --> 34:49.588
May I?
Absolutely.

34:49.621 --> 34:53.692
So, my mother was always worried
about losing her locket.

34:53.725 --> 34:57.196
This is what she would do
with a faulty clasp.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.766
Mm. Yeah.

35:00.799 --> 35:04.770
Looks like
there's something in there.

35:07.739 --> 35:10.309
How do you like them apples?

35:10.342 --> 35:12.311
Let me get that, kids.

35:12.344 --> 35:14.746
Let's see
what all this killing is about.

35:16.915 --> 35:20.486
Okay. Here we go.

35:25.724 --> 35:27.859
LASALLE:
What the hell is this?

35:31.563 --> 35:34.433
So, that ain't good.

35:34.466 --> 35:36.235
Wait a minute.

35:36.268 --> 35:39.137
There's another file on here.

35:41.307 --> 35:43.709
It's a memo. It's unfinished.

35:43.742 --> 35:45.611
Dated two days
before Wilson's death...

35:45.644 --> 35:47.413
to the Navy.

35:47.446 --> 35:50.682
Wilson was accidentally cc'd

35:50.716 --> 35:54.920
on an e-mail with a video
of Axelrod's missile system.

35:54.953 --> 35:57.189
LASALLE:
There's a defect
with the targeting mechanism,

35:57.223 --> 35:58.824
but he's waiting
on a second opinion

35:58.857 --> 36:00.759
before notifying
his superior officer.

36:02.861 --> 36:05.264
Shang Lee could have been
that second opinion.

36:05.297 --> 36:06.665
He knew how Axelrod worked.

36:06.698 --> 36:08.567
They're cleaning up
all their loose ends,

36:08.600 --> 36:10.769
which is probably why
they went after Katherine.

36:10.802 --> 36:14.306
She met with Wilson at his house
the day before he died.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.475
Must be scared
they told her something.

36:16.508 --> 36:17.843
Yeah, but the question is:

36:17.876 --> 36:19.778
Who at Axelrod
screwed up big-time,

36:19.811 --> 36:21.847
sent that e-mail, and then
tried to cover their tracks?

36:21.880 --> 36:23.715
I'm on it.

36:29.755 --> 36:31.857
This is great.
Just send me the specs.

36:31.890 --> 36:33.992
NCIS. Don't move.

36:34.025 --> 36:35.394
Whoa. What are you doing?

36:35.427 --> 36:37.396
Hey.

36:37.429 --> 36:39.931
Miss Schwartz,
you need to come with us.

36:39.965 --> 36:43.769
Wait. What

36:43.802 --> 36:46.672
Jason, I'm sure
this is a terrible mistake.

36:49.775 --> 36:52.944
This is insane. I don't know
what you're thinking,

36:52.978 --> 36:55.347
but I can promise you,
you have the wrong person.

36:55.381 --> 36:57.749
Hold that thought, please.

37:05.757 --> 37:07.759
You recognize him?

37:09.561 --> 37:11.730
Allow me
to refresh your memory.

37:11.763 --> 37:13.899
Oscar Randolph, head of security
for your company,

37:13.932 --> 37:16.768
the man you e-mailed
ten minutes after you realized

37:16.802 --> 37:18.036
Commander Wilson
had accidentally

37:18.069 --> 37:19.738
received the failed
missile test.

37:19.771 --> 37:22.841
Ex-paramilitary,
trained killer,

37:22.874 --> 37:25.911
experience using nine-millimeter
and sniper weaponry.

37:25.944 --> 37:27.913
Shoe size matches
the prints we found.

37:27.946 --> 37:29.881
And he sings
like a canary.

37:29.915 --> 37:32.384
About biotrackers
in cholesterol meds

37:32.418 --> 37:33.852
kept at work,

37:33.885 --> 37:35.454
murder for hire,

37:35.487 --> 37:36.888
and lost million-dollar bonuses

37:36.922 --> 37:38.890
if a missile deal
were to go south.

37:45.797 --> 37:46.998
Here's the deal.

37:47.032 --> 37:49.535
You talk before Agent Pride gets
in this room,

37:49.568 --> 37:52.304
and we'll tell the judge to show
leniency; you stay silent...

37:52.338 --> 37:53.905
Take your chances
with the needle.

37:57.976 --> 37:59.845
Okay, please, please, please.

37:59.878 --> 38:01.780
You have to know,
I never told him

38:01.813 --> 38:03.849
to kill Rebecca.
She wasn't supposed to be there.

38:03.882 --> 38:05.083
You'll tell the judge that,
right?

38:07.886 --> 38:09.988
Mr. Randolph
in there--

38:10.021 --> 38:11.857
he... he wants his lawyer.

38:11.890 --> 38:13.692
He's not talking.

38:13.725 --> 38:15.527
Wait. What?!

38:15.561 --> 38:16.995
Yep. Conversation

38:17.028 --> 38:20.566
wasn't very fruitful,
but it did give me

38:20.599 --> 38:23.669
time to put together
my grocery list.

38:23.702 --> 38:25.704
Need anything?

38:37.416 --> 38:39.084
Katherine?

38:40.986 --> 38:42.888
You can go home now.

38:44.055 --> 38:45.991
It's over?

38:49.795 --> 38:51.797
Nothing else
to worry about.

38:54.933 --> 38:56.802
I got to say, though,

38:56.835 --> 38:59.505
protective custody
has its advantages.

38:59.538 --> 39:01.507
Company wasn't half bad.

39:05.176 --> 39:09.615
Oh. I thought you might
like to have it.

39:25.564 --> 39:27.799
Looks nice.

39:27.833 --> 39:30.402
Darby had good taste.

39:32.838 --> 39:35.741
I should go.

40:03.502 --> 40:05.471
You still at it?

40:05.504 --> 40:07.873
Yeah. Cars can be stubborn.

40:07.906 --> 40:11.009
That ain't the
only thing.

40:11.042 --> 40:13.011
I've been thinking why you
haven't fixed the car yet.

40:13.044 --> 40:14.580
What'd you come up with?

40:16.582 --> 40:19.951
Well, if the car doesn't work,
Linda's gonna keep calling.

40:19.985 --> 40:21.953
Keeps her in your life.

40:21.987 --> 40:26.024
Once it's fixed,
less reason to call.

40:26.057 --> 40:27.859
Ah.

40:30.862 --> 40:32.798
Not going to Linda.
I'm selling it.

40:34.666 --> 40:36.668
Yeah, packed her things,

40:36.702 --> 40:39.070
closed up the house,
went to her sister's.

40:39.104 --> 40:41.039
We both decided
it was for the best.

40:41.072 --> 40:43.108
So, is this permanent?

40:45.010 --> 40:46.845
Don't you love
the sound of that?

40:48.246 --> 40:49.247
Go for a ride?

40:49.280 --> 40:50.916
You gonna let me drive?

40:50.949 --> 40:53.552
Not a chance.

40:57.989 --> 41:00.659
* Fire on the bayou

41:00.692 --> 41:02.828
* Gonna do it like you wanna

41:02.861 --> 41:05.096
* Fire *
* Hey, now, on the bayou

41:05.130 --> 41:07.132
* Come on, everybody

41:07.165 --> 41:10.802
* Fire *
* Hey, now, on the bayou.
