01:35.512 --> 01:37.680
One, two...

01:37.848 --> 01:40.516
- (buzzer)

01:47.024 --> 01:49.025
(door opens)

01:51.320 --> 01:53.321
(muffled screaming)

01:56.074 --> 01:57.867
That was better.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.870
- (grunts)
- (screaming stops)

02:12.174 --> 02:13.508
(door slams)

02:13.675 --> 02:15.676
(woman screaming)

02:44.623 --> 02:47.625
- He got a book on puppy training.
- I know. I saw it.

02:47.793 --> 02:49.126
(tsks)
Oh.

02:50.504 --> 02:53.172
Maybe by Christmas
I can make it work.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.716
- Really?
- Don't say anything yet.

02:55.884 --> 03:00.346
Oh, my God, you are so sexy
when you make secret plans.

03:00.514 --> 03:03.724
(laughs)
Thanks.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.151
Okay.

03:16.071 --> 03:17.947
(engine starts)

03:20.367 --> 03:24.161
- Mom: Love you.
- Come on, guys. Let's go.

03:24.329 --> 03:25.830
Mom: When you're at camp
this summer.

03:25.998 --> 03:27.582
- Boy: I can still go to camp?
- Mom: Of course.

03:27.749 --> 03:30.960
Your dad's working six days a week
and I'll be working again soon.

03:31.128 --> 03:32.837
Dad: So let's not worry, huh?
You're going to camp.

03:36.425 --> 03:38.217
Mom:
Thanks, sweetie.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.928
- We'll see you tonight.
- Okay.

03:41.096 --> 03:43.848
Hey, don't take the bus home, okay?

03:44.016 --> 03:45.057
- Take a cab.
- Don't be silly.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.434
- Take a cab.
- No.

03:46.602 --> 03:48.227
You know how expensive
cabs are these days.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.897
No. Another 40 bucks is not gonna
break the mortgage.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.857
Seriously, no bus.

03:53.025 --> 03:54.358
And you wonder
why I love you so much.

03:54.526 --> 03:56.152
- 'Cause I'm a catch.
- I know that.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.362
Hey, champ, you look after
your mom, okay?

03:58.530 --> 04:00.323
Boy: 'Kay.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.242
- In one ear and out the window.
- (mom laughs)

04:05.913 --> 04:08.205
Boy: Oh, look.
"Shifter" is playing?

04:08.373 --> 04:10.333
Hey, you wanna
go see that instead?

04:12.252 --> 04:13.544
Dad said no way.

04:13.712 --> 04:16.672
Well, Dad's not here.
It's just you and me.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.507
- Really?
- Come on, let's do it.

04:18.675 --> 04:21.218
You're gonna have to hold my hand
during the really scary parts.

04:21.386 --> 04:24.055
- Boy: I'll hold it the whole time.
- (laughs)

04:30.562 --> 04:33.189
Did you see when
that guy's face came off?

04:33.357 --> 04:36.067
No. My eyes were closed
and my ears were shut.

04:36.234 --> 04:38.277
Ugh. Aren't you worried
about nightmares?

04:38.445 --> 04:40.613
- Mom, I'm nine now.
- Ha.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.115
Hi. Can we get a taxi, please?

04:43.283 --> 04:44.742
- Mom. Mom.
- Right away to the--

04:44.910 --> 04:47.954
Oh, you know what? We're good.
We don't need one.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.372
Thanks.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.207
Come on.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.380
Let's get you in.

05:00.926 --> 05:04.387
Hey there.
Can we get 1085 Chestnut?

05:04.554 --> 05:07.515
- The big park.
- Driver: Got it.

05:07.683 --> 05:10.142
Mom:
Hey, hon. It's us.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.686
We are in a cab
and we're on our way home.

05:11.853 --> 05:13.854
- (video game beeping)
- Love you.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.486
- Mom: Dude, what happened?
- Boy: I went through a door.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.154
You watched the movie.
You should know.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.865
Sorry.
Did your face fall off yet?

05:25.033 --> 05:27.201
- No.
- (laughing)

05:27.369 --> 05:29.537
I can't believe you missed that part.

05:36.628 --> 05:41.340
Um, excuse me,
that was our exit.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.387
"Don't take the bus," he says.
"Take a cab."

05:46.555 --> 05:47.555
You gonna call Dad?

05:47.723 --> 05:51.392
Well, I would, but now
I'm not getting any service.

05:51.560 --> 05:55.688
I think if you just keep
going straight, then-- okay.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.732
Um...
(chuckles)

05:57.899 --> 06:00.317
You know where we are?

06:00.485 --> 06:03.487
Sir? Could you just pull over?

06:05.490 --> 06:08.909
Hey, listen, um...

06:09.077 --> 06:10.995
I've got a child back here
and you're beginning to scare

06:11.163 --> 06:15.207
the bejesus out of me,
so if you don't pull over right now,

06:15.375 --> 06:17.501
then I'm not only gonna report you
to the cab company,

06:17.669 --> 06:19.003
but to the fuckin' police as well!

06:19.171 --> 06:20.171
Pull over!

06:20.338 --> 06:23.215
Boy:
Mom, is everything okay?

06:23.383 --> 06:26.844
Mom: Just let us out, please.
Just stop the car and talk to me.

06:27.012 --> 06:28.846
This is scaring us.

06:29.014 --> 06:31.140
- All right, just let us out here.
- Mom. Mom.

06:31.308 --> 06:33.059
Mom: I won't report you.
I won't say anything.

06:33.226 --> 06:37.188
- Just keep trying the doors.
- No, Mom, I'm staying with you.

06:37.355 --> 06:39.690
Mom:
Open these fucking doors!

06:39.858 --> 06:42.151
- Baby, baby.
- (door handle thudding)

06:42.319 --> 06:43.819
Boy:
I can't! I can't!

06:43.987 --> 06:46.238
- Mom: Let us out of the car!
- (pounding)

06:46.406 --> 06:47.823
Damn it!

06:49.493 --> 06:52.369
Let us out of the fucking car!

06:52.537 --> 06:55.289
Oh, God.

06:55.457 --> 06:58.876
(shouts)
Now, you fucker!

07:01.213 --> 07:03.172
Motherfucker!

07:03.340 --> 07:05.132
Oh, God.

07:05.300 --> 07:06.842
Okay, he stopped.

07:07.010 --> 07:09.845
- He's getting out.
- Boy: What is happening?

07:10.013 --> 07:12.640
Mom: I'm gonna talk to him.
You're gonna take the phone.

07:12.808 --> 07:14.600
When I scream, "Run,"
you're gonna run.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.268
- It's gonna be okay.
- Boy: No.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.436
- I'll find you.
- Mom, no.

07:17.604 --> 07:20.022
- I will find you, baby.
- No, I'm not leaving without you.

07:20.190 --> 07:22.483
It's gonna be okay.

07:22.651 --> 07:25.236
- Oh, my God! Wait!
- (crying) Mom!

07:25.403 --> 07:27.321
- Don't you--
- (punch lands)

07:36.331 --> 07:39.542
(crying)
Mom? Please.

08:16.454 --> 08:19.707
Mom, are you okay?

08:19.875 --> 08:22.376
Mom:
Oh, my God.

08:22.544 --> 08:25.546
- (door opens)
- Mom: Look at me. Look at me.

08:25.714 --> 08:27.298
- We're gonna be okay, all right?
- Boy: What does he want?

08:27.465 --> 08:29.466
We're gonna be fine.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.306
Boy:
Leave her alone!

08:41.313 --> 08:42.313
Mom!

08:42.480 --> 08:44.148
No!

08:44.316 --> 08:45.816
Mom!

08:45.984 --> 08:48.235
Just stay in the car!

08:48.403 --> 08:50.321
- No!
- Mom! Mom!

08:50.488 --> 08:52.990
(screaming)

08:53.158 --> 08:55.159
Mom.

08:55.327 --> 08:58.037
Please. Please. Please.

09:04.419 --> 09:06.378
Mom?

09:10.634 --> 09:13.093
- Mom?
- It's okay.

09:13.261 --> 09:14.595
Mommy's fine, baby.

09:14.763 --> 09:16.972
Mommy's fine.
Just stay in the car.

09:17.140 --> 09:20.142
You're gonna be fine.
Don't worry.

09:20.310 --> 09:22.311
You're gonna be fine, baby.
Stay in the car.

09:22.479 --> 09:25.147
Cover your ears.
Cover your ears.

09:44.876 --> 09:48.754
(mother screaming)

09:56.346 --> 09:58.138
(sobbing)
Mom.

09:58.306 --> 10:00.557
(screaming stops)

10:42.642 --> 10:44.268
No. No!

10:44.436 --> 10:46.562
Mom! Uh.

11:01.578 --> 11:04.079
You look like your mother.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.583
My dad's gonna find you.

11:07.751 --> 11:11.795
If-- if that's what you believe.

11:13.423 --> 11:14.965
(grunts)

11:15.133 --> 11:17.051
Ah!

11:22.307 --> 11:24.767
That is the last free shot
that you will ever get.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.520
You will skip dinner.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.818
(groans)

11:37.822 --> 11:40.032
I want my mom.

11:40.200 --> 11:45.412
Well, she's not coming back, ever,

11:45.580 --> 11:48.582
so get used to it.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.386
Boy: Mom.

12:02.722 --> 12:05.766
(TV turns on)

12:12.315 --> 12:14.316
(clock ticking)

12:24.786 --> 12:27.287
You smell like piss.

12:38.466 --> 12:41.218
I didn't ask for you.

12:42.637 --> 12:47.182
But since you're here,
I'm going to make the most of it.

12:48.184 --> 12:51.395
You will have one job.

12:51.563 --> 12:53.105
(opens door)

12:53.273 --> 12:55.107
You do what I say.

12:55.275 --> 12:58.610
You clean up my house.

12:58.778 --> 13:02.406
Garbage bags, mops,
bucket, broom--

13:02.574 --> 13:04.575
they are your tools.

13:05.577 --> 13:07.453
Breakfast.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.997
You will serve me breakfast

13:10.165 --> 13:14.501
every morning
for the rest of your life.

13:14.669 --> 13:19.756
You will not eat or drink anything
without my permission.

13:21.259 --> 13:24.511
You only eat after I have eaten,

13:24.679 --> 13:27.723
and only what I have
left on my plate.

13:30.727 --> 13:31.977
- (button clicks)
- (buzzer)

13:32.145 --> 13:33.812
You hear that?

13:33.980 --> 13:36.690
That means that
I'm bringing one back.

13:38.276 --> 13:41.069
You have 10 seconds
to open these locks.

13:43.531 --> 13:47.993
Every night I bring home
a newspaper.

13:48.161 --> 13:52.498
After I finish reading it,
I want you to try and find stories

13:52.665 --> 13:55.167
about missing people.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.586
You cut them out
nice and neat...

13:57.754 --> 13:58.754
The licenses.

13:58.922 --> 14:01.757
...and you put them
in the scrapbook.

14:01.925 --> 14:04.760
Cash. See?

14:06.596 --> 14:10.057
There is no phone in this house.

14:10.225 --> 14:14.102
The TV is off limits unless I offer it.

14:15.980 --> 14:20.025
If someone knocks at the--

14:20.193 --> 14:22.194
well, no one's gonna knock.

14:24.906 --> 14:28.784
If you steal from me,
you get a beating.

14:28.952 --> 14:32.204
If you try and escape
or you don't keep the house clean,

14:32.372 --> 14:34.623
you get a beating.

14:34.791 --> 14:39.753
If you make me nervous
or get in my way at all, a beating.

14:39.921 --> 14:44.466
From now on, this is your world.

14:46.094 --> 14:50.847
It is only you, me, and them.

14:57.981 --> 15:00.774
I will call you Rabbit.

15:01.943 --> 15:03.944
(wind howling)

15:13.288 --> 15:15.914
On page 12,
there is a nice piece

15:16.082 --> 15:21.003
about you
and your mother missing.

15:24.799 --> 15:26.967
Put it in the scrapbook.

15:31.306 --> 15:34.308
(door opens, closes)

15:40.940 --> 15:43.567
(car engine starts)

15:46.154 --> 15:48.155
(garage door opens)

15:50.908 --> 15:52.909
(garage door closes)

16:12.889 --> 16:14.514
(grunts)

16:50.426 --> 16:53.011
You going somewhere, Rabbit?

16:54.889 --> 16:57.724
You get an A for effort.

16:59.185 --> 17:02.270
I know every move that you make.

17:05.525 --> 17:08.902
Help!

17:09.069 --> 17:13.531
Everything you do
I let you do!

17:13.700 --> 17:16.201
Go ahead, let it out.

17:16.368 --> 17:19.954
Help!

17:20.123 --> 17:21.748
- Somebody!
- Let it out.

17:21.915 --> 17:23.791
- Help!
- That's it.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.794
- Let it go. Let it go.
- Help, somebody!

17:25.962 --> 17:28.922
- Come on.
- Help!

17:29.090 --> 17:31.466
Dad!

17:31.634 --> 17:35.262
You are so fucking predictable.

17:35.430 --> 17:36.888
Somebody!

17:37.056 --> 17:39.808
And a fucking embarrassment.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.768
Help!

17:43.146 --> 17:45.147
Come on.

17:47.108 --> 17:48.734
Come on, Rabbit.

17:49.819 --> 17:52.904
Hey, Rabbit,

17:53.072 --> 17:54.948
what are you gonna do with that?

18:00.788 --> 18:02.372
Don't be a quitter.

18:04.792 --> 18:08.420
Rabbit, you have to follow through.

18:08.588 --> 18:13.049
Following through
is the key to life.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.136
Come on down.
I'll tell you what--

18:16.304 --> 18:20.807
you come down and I will
give you a running start.

18:20.975 --> 18:23.185
Go ahead.
Come on.

18:25.980 --> 18:27.856
Come on, kid!

18:28.900 --> 18:31.651
Come on, kid.
That's it.

18:31.819 --> 18:33.779
That's it. Go.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.742
Come on,
give it all you've got.

18:39.744 --> 18:42.162
Come on, let it go, kid.

18:42.330 --> 18:45.040
Let it go, kid.
Come on.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.836
You're a paper doll.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.138
(scrubbing)

19:35.174 --> 19:38.218
(crying)

19:40.555 --> 19:43.265
(mock crying)

19:45.142 --> 19:47.143
(crying)

19:53.818 --> 19:55.902
(door slams)

19:56.070 --> 20:05.495
(Bob crying)

20:10.626 --> 20:12.627
(TV playing)

20:47.246 --> 20:49.039
Women love flowers.

20:49.206 --> 20:50.707
Reporter on TV:
...aren't releasing any information

20:50.875 --> 20:53.877
until they complete
their investigation.

20:54.045 --> 20:57.130
A government bill that cracked down
on laboratory experiments on animals

20:57.298 --> 20:59.215
is expected to become law today.

20:59.383 --> 21:02.427
Animal rights activists have been
pushing for the bill for nine years

21:02.595 --> 21:04.471
and have taken part
in mass demonstrations

21:04.639 --> 21:06.306
throughout the nation.

21:12.897 --> 21:14.397
Thanks.

21:26.327 --> 21:27.744
2314 Grafton.

21:39.298 --> 21:43.218
I'm... real sorry, Dad.

21:46.180 --> 21:50.183
- Dad--
- Not a fucking word.

21:55.773 --> 21:57.857
(slaps)

22:05.408 --> 22:09.577
I've known you all your life...

22:11.247 --> 22:13.206
and you're nothing special.

22:15.418 --> 22:17.419
You're nothing special.

22:21.382 --> 22:22.757
(grunts, slaps)

23:37.124 --> 23:39.000
(door closes)

23:39.168 --> 23:41.169
(chains rattling)

24:21.335 --> 24:26.339
Did your dad toss a ball around

24:26.507 --> 24:29.259
with you in the backyard?

24:29.426 --> 24:32.053
You know, after school,
like-- or Sundays?

24:34.306 --> 24:36.599
I mean,
did he do things with you,

24:36.767 --> 24:39.477
teach you things?

24:39.645 --> 24:41.521
Or was he just fucked?

24:48.279 --> 24:51.197
Do you want to learn things?

24:51.365 --> 24:53.324
To really learn?

24:55.327 --> 24:57.704
Because it's important
as hell to know shit.

24:57.872 --> 25:02.125
Otherwise, people will--
they will walk all over you.

25:06.422 --> 25:10.425
I got things

25:10.593 --> 25:13.386
that you should learn.

25:13.554 --> 25:15.054
Okay.

25:23.564 --> 25:26.399
You are not going to be ignorant.

25:28.777 --> 25:31.446
You're going to study
and you're going to learn.

25:37.786 --> 25:40.455
- About what?
- People--

25:40.623 --> 25:43.458
what makes them tick,
what makes them work,

25:43.626 --> 25:46.711
what's in the gut and the head.

25:50.591 --> 25:52.091
Why?

25:52.259 --> 25:54.677
Because without education,
you're fucked.

25:58.849 --> 26:01.768
I mean,
you've seen some things.

26:04.271 --> 26:07.398
I've showed you
some things for sure,

26:07.566 --> 26:09.817
but you haven't understood them.

26:15.616 --> 26:18.159
You ever do a puzzle?

26:18.327 --> 26:20.245
You know, the kind of puzzle
that has the picture

26:20.412 --> 26:22.956
on the outside of the box?

26:23.123 --> 26:26.000
That's what people are--

26:26.168 --> 26:29.629
pictures on the outside,
pieces inside.

26:34.385 --> 26:39.305
This book is about
the human puzzle.

26:42.017 --> 26:44.602
You study this,
you learn it,

26:44.770 --> 26:47.689
and you know how to take people apart,
put them back together,

26:47.856 --> 26:49.691
understand them.

26:49.858 --> 26:51.484
Oh.

26:52.653 --> 26:55.947
So study it and--
just study.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.741
You don't want to be
shackled to this house

26:58.909 --> 27:00.201
for the rest of your life,
do you?

27:00.369 --> 27:01.619
- No.
- Good.

27:01.787 --> 27:03.288
There's hope for you yet.

27:03.455 --> 27:08.501
So, study hard,

27:08.669 --> 27:13.715
and then maybe you and I can
work out a deal.

27:15.551 --> 27:16.801
A deal for what?

27:16.969 --> 27:18.928
Some freedom.

27:19.096 --> 27:22.432
You know, get off the chain,
get out of the house,

27:22.599 --> 27:24.392
get a girl.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.519
You're older now.

27:28.272 --> 27:30.273
I think that...

27:32.443 --> 27:35.278
you should have a taste
of a woman real soon.

27:47.041 --> 27:50.209
I won't take the puzzles apart.
I won't kill them.

27:53.505 --> 27:56.090
(sighs)

27:58.093 --> 28:01.429
I give you a gift of knowledge

28:01.597 --> 28:04.557
and you fuck it away!

28:04.725 --> 28:08.102
You are looking to be shackled
to this fucking wall

28:08.270 --> 28:10.563
for the rest of your life, mister.

28:27.581 --> 28:32.085
I wasn't gonna show you this,
but now that you're being a shit...

28:33.295 --> 28:36.506
That's your dad.

28:36.673 --> 28:38.674
He remarried.

28:39.676 --> 28:41.552
Dad.

28:42.721 --> 28:47.016
He's got a new wife, a new life.

28:50.062 --> 28:51.562
You see this, kid?

28:51.730 --> 28:53.606
That is not someone
that misses you.

28:58.654 --> 29:02.156
You got me and no one else.

29:06.912 --> 29:09.622
Here, have a beer.

29:13.794 --> 29:15.670
No, thank you.

29:22.010 --> 29:24.804
- Can I still study the books?
- Yeah, have at it.

30:07.097 --> 30:08.723
That's good.

30:09.766 --> 30:12.852
- Give me an answer.
- I-- I'm not sure.

30:13.020 --> 30:15.438
That's not the answer I'm looking for,
not by a long shot.

30:15.606 --> 30:17.315
But I'm not sure.

30:17.483 --> 30:19.192
If we gotta stay here all night,
then that's what we'll do--

30:19.359 --> 30:21.235
we'll stay here all night.

30:40.339 --> 30:41.589
Bob: All right, give me
your best guess.

30:41.757 --> 30:45.092
- It could be...
- Yes?

30:45.260 --> 30:47.094
...small-cell carcinoma?

30:47.262 --> 30:49.263
Yes. Nice. Good.

30:49.431 --> 30:51.015
That's good.

31:09.618 --> 31:11.244
(woman screams)

31:13.830 --> 31:16.165
(screaming continues)
No!

31:19.169 --> 31:20.920
No!

31:21.088 --> 31:22.713
(thuds)

31:25.551 --> 31:27.343
(woman screams)

31:27.511 --> 31:29.929
- (thuds)
- (man yells)

31:30.097 --> 31:31.264
(door opens)

31:39.356 --> 31:50.950
(murmuring)

31:57.833 --> 31:59.750
How do I get out of here?

32:04.756 --> 32:07.550
Which way?

32:07.718 --> 32:12.221
Which way is out?

32:15.142 --> 32:16.809
I'll take you with me.

32:18.687 --> 32:21.981
I don't want your fucking blanket!

32:22.149 --> 32:25.067
Please!
I just wanna go home.

32:25.235 --> 32:27.153
How the fuck do I get out of--

32:27.321 --> 32:28.738
(dull thud)

32:44.463 --> 32:47.089
(crow cawing)

32:47.257 --> 32:48.883
Go.

32:57.142 --> 32:59.393
That's it.
Come on.

33:02.689 --> 33:06.692
That's what you want
in a girl-- some fight.

33:07.778 --> 33:09.779
There's no sport in easy.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.787
- You thinking stupid thoughts?
- No.

33:17.954 --> 33:20.414
No, I'm not thinking,
just listening.

33:20.582 --> 33:22.208
Good.

33:22.376 --> 33:23.918
Listening is good.

33:25.420 --> 33:33.344
Come on.

33:36.473 --> 33:38.724
She was quite a ride, too.

33:40.060 --> 33:42.853
She sure could run.

33:46.274 --> 33:48.150
Hey, let's play.

33:48.318 --> 33:50.695
Come on.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.863
Come on, one round.
Come on.

33:57.077 --> 34:00.204
Okay. Okay.

34:00.372 --> 34:02.039
Okay.

34:15.387 --> 34:17.263
All right.

34:24.146 --> 34:30.025
Ellen Rand.

34:30.193 --> 34:31.944
22 years old.

34:32.112 --> 34:36.407
Her birthday:
February the 19th.

34:36.574 --> 34:39.952
Lied like a rug
about her weight big time.

34:47.043 --> 34:48.627
Thank you.

34:55.635 --> 34:59.013
Jennifer Elizabeth Wyatt.

35:02.809 --> 35:07.730
1642 Melvin Road, apartment 7.

35:07.898 --> 35:10.691
Organ donor.

35:10.859 --> 35:13.402
Born September 7th.

35:13.570 --> 35:16.363
And you said that she was honest
about her weight.

35:16.531 --> 35:18.616
She put 126.

35:23.246 --> 35:25.080
I don't know about weight.

35:26.291 --> 35:27.958
Well, you will.

36:27.602 --> 36:29.478
You'd better go in.

36:35.193 --> 36:39.780
Well, there they are now.

36:39.948 --> 36:42.032
Your mother's been
worried sick about you boys.

36:47.080 --> 36:50.708
- Man: School good today, Bobby?
- Yeah.

36:50.876 --> 36:52.710
Lying sack of shit!

36:52.878 --> 36:55.421
(bangs)

36:59.217 --> 37:02.553
You think you're better than I am
just because I got laid off?

37:03.930 --> 37:05.931
Aren't you, Bobby?

37:06.099 --> 37:09.894
Big man making money.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.354
(groans)

37:14.065 --> 37:16.066
(Bob groaning)

37:16.234 --> 37:19.445
You're such a big man now.
Let's see you in action.

37:19.613 --> 37:22.114
(Bob crying)

37:23.575 --> 37:26.744
Get your fuckin' clothes off,
Bobby, now!

37:26.912 --> 37:29.955
(shouting)

37:30.123 --> 37:31.624
Man:
Take him, Joanne.

37:31.791 --> 37:34.919
Put him inside you.
Let him show you how big he is.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.629
(crying)
It's okay.

37:39.007 --> 37:41.467
(shouting)

37:43.511 --> 37:46.597
(crying)

37:46.765 --> 37:49.058
You're a fucking whore, Joanne.

37:49.225 --> 37:51.268
(crying)

37:53.063 --> 37:54.647
It's okay.

37:57.400 --> 38:00.069
Get off me.

38:00.236 --> 38:01.612
Honey.

38:06.034 --> 38:08.869
(Bob shouts)

38:30.558 --> 38:31.976
(screaming)

38:32.143 --> 38:34.436
(panting)

39:01.089 --> 39:03.799
(girl giggling)

39:10.223 --> 39:13.183
Hi. Hi.

39:13.351 --> 39:15.227
I'm Mary.
(hiccups)

39:15.395 --> 39:17.021
Mary.

39:18.940 --> 39:23.277
I need to pee.
(laughing)

39:23.445 --> 39:26.905
Which way is the powder room?

39:31.828 --> 39:33.704
Which way?

39:33.872 --> 39:35.873
I gotta go.

39:39.794 --> 39:42.421
Please?

39:42.589 --> 39:44.173
I gotta go.

39:46.676 --> 39:49.219
Show her where
the powder room is, Rabbit.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.305
Show me.

39:54.517 --> 39:55.517
Oh.

39:57.312 --> 39:59.563
Not that powder room.

39:59.731 --> 40:01.273
The other one.

40:07.989 --> 40:10.032
- Oh!
- (chains rattling)

40:10.200 --> 40:12.451
Ooh, kinky.

40:12.619 --> 40:15.412
You're gonna tie me up?
(laughing)

40:18.458 --> 40:20.375
You guys.

40:20.543 --> 40:23.128
That's not cool.

40:24.297 --> 40:27.049
Gotta be...

40:27.217 --> 40:30.636
I guess you could smoke.
I'd rather you didn't.

40:30.804 --> 40:33.055
(laughs)
You'd rather I didn't?

40:33.223 --> 40:35.390
Okay, well, I have to pee.

40:35.558 --> 40:37.559
So if you're gonna hold out
on the powder room,

40:37.727 --> 40:39.603
I'm gonna smoke.

40:39.771 --> 40:41.313
- That's what I'm gonna do.
- (lighter clicking)

40:41.481 --> 40:44.274
Remember I saw you dancing?

40:44.442 --> 40:47.194
- Yeah.
- Remember?

40:47.362 --> 40:49.571
I love dancing.

40:49.739 --> 40:52.116
But you didn't dance.

40:52.283 --> 40:54.660
(humming)

40:54.828 --> 40:57.371
- It's--
- (girl laughs)

40:59.207 --> 41:02.376
It's okay. Everything is--
it's gonna be okay.

41:02.544 --> 41:04.211
(pats)

41:07.257 --> 41:09.466
I think I'm too drunk.

41:09.634 --> 41:11.176
I'm drunk.

41:11.344 --> 41:13.762
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

41:13.930 --> 41:16.723
Don't be silly.

41:16.891 --> 41:18.725
Everything will be okay, right?

41:18.893 --> 41:20.144
(giggles)

41:20.311 --> 41:22.312
Well, say it.
Say, "It's okay."

41:22.480 --> 41:25.232
- It's okay.
- Now come here.

41:26.526 --> 41:29.528
It's okay.
It's okay.

41:29.696 --> 41:32.698
It's okay. It's okay.

41:32.866 --> 41:35.200
(gagging)

42:00.059 --> 42:04.605
- Carotid artery.
- Yes, carotid artery.

42:04.772 --> 42:06.773
(gasping)

42:45.063 --> 42:46.605
Mary.

43:11.881 --> 43:21.223
(whimpers)

43:30.400 --> 43:32.150
(cries out)

43:36.197 --> 43:38.323
(Rabbit cries out)

43:38.491 --> 43:40.409
(grunts)

43:47.542 --> 43:49.293
(Rabbit grunts)

43:51.546 --> 43:53.297
(Rabbit cries out)

43:55.466 --> 43:57.843
(shouts)

44:00.054 --> 44:03.140
(Rabbit panting)

44:03.308 --> 44:05.726
No!

44:05.893 --> 44:07.894
(sobbing)

44:22.577 --> 44:24.494
Bob:
I got something for you.

44:26.372 --> 44:30.334
This is a school yearbook.

44:32.920 --> 44:35.630
You see?

44:35.798 --> 44:37.799
It has...

44:47.435 --> 44:50.228
Tell me when you see
something you like.

45:10.416 --> 45:12.209
Pick it up.

45:12.377 --> 45:14.044
I don't want it.

45:17.465 --> 45:19.424
Pick it up.

45:31.229 --> 45:34.856
Where do you think that you are
right now on the food chain, Rabbit?

45:39.821 --> 45:41.655
I won't do it.

45:46.119 --> 45:49.871
No kid of mine is gonna grow up

45:50.039 --> 45:52.541
uselessly educated.

45:55.253 --> 45:56.670
I'm not your kid.

45:56.838 --> 45:58.672
The fuck you're not.

46:01.968 --> 46:03.510
Pick it up.

46:12.687 --> 46:14.396
Look around.

46:15.606 --> 46:19.693
What do you see?

46:21.654 --> 46:24.865
Do you see anything that says
that you aren't my kid?

46:26.367 --> 46:29.286
That we aren't family?

46:29.454 --> 46:31.204
Do you see?

46:33.749 --> 46:36.209
Now pick it up.

46:36.377 --> 46:37.961
Pick it up.

46:41.549 --> 46:43.175
Yeah.

46:47.638 --> 46:48.847
Good.

46:55.771 --> 46:58.648
I don't wanna hear a sound
out of you the rest of the night.

47:00.359 --> 47:02.652
I don't wanna know that you exist.

48:35.705 --> 48:37.747
(door opens)

48:37.915 --> 48:40.875
- Thank you.
- (door closes)

49:09.905 --> 49:11.906
Bob:
We made the news again.

49:14.368 --> 49:16.202
They don't know anything,
the cops.

49:18.873 --> 49:21.458
We are a mystery.

49:21.626 --> 49:25.337
No evidence.
In one ear and out the window.

49:27.590 --> 49:30.717
It is a good day to be me, Rabbit.

49:34.847 --> 49:36.348
I'm done with this scrapbook.

49:46.025 --> 49:48.360
Good. Right.

49:51.322 --> 49:52.906
It's full.

49:54.533 --> 49:56.534
Well, I will get you another one.

49:56.702 --> 49:58.703
It's good to keep a record.

50:01.290 --> 50:02.916
Why do you do what you do?

50:05.711 --> 50:07.671
What the fuck?

50:08.673 --> 50:10.965
I asked why you do what you do.

50:12.301 --> 50:15.053
- Why do you do what you do?
- You make me.

50:15.221 --> 50:19.432
Well, that is a good answer.

50:19.600 --> 50:21.851
Then I guess they make me
do what I do.

50:24.438 --> 50:26.272
Who does?

50:27.316 --> 50:30.110
Them...

50:30.277 --> 50:33.238
under the dirt, in the book.

50:33.406 --> 50:34.989
Them.

50:38.744 --> 50:40.745
They never asked to be murdered.

50:47.962 --> 50:51.548
Oh, you are

50:51.716 --> 50:53.925
growing a pair all of a sudden.

50:59.724 --> 51:02.475
And they did.

51:02.643 --> 51:05.603
- They asked.
- When?

51:11.944 --> 51:14.654
The day that they were
fuckin' born.

51:17.950 --> 51:19.242
I don't understand.

51:19.410 --> 51:21.995
Oh, you fuckin'...

51:26.917 --> 51:29.836
You are f--

51:30.004 --> 51:34.299
are you trying to make me
fucking insane?

51:35.843 --> 51:37.802
Do I have to spell it out for you?

51:37.970 --> 51:40.346
They are all fucking whores!

51:40.514 --> 51:42.974
They are all fucking sluts!

51:45.144 --> 51:47.103
They seemed like
nice people to me.

51:47.271 --> 51:49.856
(mocks) "They seemed
like nice people to me."

51:52.026 --> 51:54.235
Oh, you are--

51:54.403 --> 51:57.405
oh, you gotta get laid.

51:57.573 --> 52:00.200
You are getting fucked up
in the head.

52:07.958 --> 52:10.877
Gotta get your taste
of a woman for sure.

52:12.880 --> 52:17.091
Nothing like the taste of a woman
to make you clear.

53:27.913 --> 53:31.791
(silent)

53:39.133 --> 53:41.885
Did you find one yet?

53:51.270 --> 53:52.896
We'll see.

53:53.981 --> 53:55.815
(clears throat)

53:59.111 --> 54:00.945
Somewhere...

54:05.451 --> 54:08.620
Somewhere in here
there is a Mrs. Right.

54:14.835 --> 54:16.961
Somewhere in here.

54:42.029 --> 54:44.030
(whimpers)

54:50.496 --> 54:52.205
Find her. Come on.

54:52.373 --> 54:54.749
Pick one.

54:54.917 --> 54:56.417
Don't be shy.

54:56.585 --> 54:59.003
Don't be shy.
Come on.

54:59.171 --> 55:01.339
Find one.
Find one. Look.

55:01.507 --> 55:04.384
That's it.
Where, oh, where could she be?

55:04.551 --> 55:06.970
Pick one!
Come on.

55:24.154 --> 55:26.030
I think that's a good choice.

55:32.037 --> 55:35.581
Oh, yes.

55:50.514 --> 55:54.183
(banging)

55:54.351 --> 55:56.352
(muffled yelling)

56:05.112 --> 56:08.114
- (banging continues)
- (Bob humming)

56:21.170 --> 56:23.171
(door opens)

56:26.967 --> 56:28.009
(door closes)

56:43.942 --> 56:45.318
She's ready.

56:49.656 --> 56:51.282
Come on.

57:01.251 --> 57:03.503
Rabbit.
(patting)

57:21.146 --> 57:23.022
(sighs)

57:33.534 --> 57:35.159
You're scared.

57:37.454 --> 57:39.205
That's okay.

57:40.707 --> 57:42.125
Everyone's scared the first time.

57:42.292 --> 57:43.918
Yeah.

57:52.553 --> 57:54.178
(gasps)

57:55.389 --> 57:57.932
(whimpering)

58:00.561 --> 58:03.020
Bob:
You said to me that

58:03.188 --> 58:07.942
you didn't want to be chained
to the wall your whole life,

58:08.110 --> 58:09.485
didn't you?

58:11.363 --> 58:13.030
Come on.

58:16.326 --> 58:17.743
Let's go.

58:27.629 --> 58:29.172
Come on.

58:29.339 --> 58:31.132
Come on. That's it.
Come on.

58:31.300 --> 58:34.552
Yeah. Come on.
That's it.

58:41.518 --> 58:44.896
There's only one

58:45.063 --> 58:48.816
real way out for you

58:48.984 --> 58:51.444
to prove to me
that I can trust you.

58:54.406 --> 58:56.657
And there's only--

58:56.825 --> 58:59.368
there's only one way to do that.

59:02.456 --> 59:04.248
Yeah.

59:06.877 --> 59:08.377
Let's go.

59:13.091 --> 59:14.884
You gotta prove it to me.

59:15.052 --> 59:18.012
You gotta prove it.
Come on.

59:43.038 --> 59:45.373
(crying)

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:03.766
(groans)

01:00:05.269 --> 01:00:06.644
Come on.

01:00:10.274 --> 01:00:12.066
- Okay.
- (muffled whimpering)

01:00:12.234 --> 01:00:14.443
Be quiet.

01:00:15.988 --> 01:00:19.448
Quiet to keep the mood.

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:23.077
- Quiet.
- (whimpering stops)

01:00:23.245 --> 01:00:26.330
- Yes?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

01:00:32.379 --> 01:00:36.590
Come on.

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:42.596
Bob:
It's his first time...

01:00:44.558 --> 01:00:46.642
so he's a little shy.

01:00:47.894 --> 01:00:49.895
Yeah.

01:01:23.638 --> 01:01:26.766
You remember
what we talked about?

01:01:29.186 --> 01:01:31.896
If you can't do it, I will.

01:01:32.064 --> 01:01:34.482
And you know how that
will turn out.

01:01:37.903 --> 01:01:40.446
So you keep your head straight.

01:01:43.617 --> 01:01:46.494
Have some fun.

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:12.103
(knife clatters)

01:02:30.455 --> 01:02:32.456
(clock ticking)

01:02:42.801 --> 01:02:44.802
(TV playing)

01:02:56.398 --> 01:02:58.274
I'm Angie.

01:03:02.446 --> 01:03:04.196
I'm 18.

01:03:09.244 --> 01:03:10.786
What's your name?

01:03:15.417 --> 01:03:17.168
I'm Rabbit.

01:03:19.546 --> 01:03:21.547
Are you gonna hurt me, Rabbit?

01:03:24.593 --> 01:03:26.635
I don't want to.

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:30.848
But he's expecting you to.

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:46.322
But you have a knife.

01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:50.117
Can't we-- can't we just
get out of here?

01:03:50.285 --> 01:03:52.786
We can't get out.

01:03:56.208 --> 01:03:58.501
How long have you been here?

01:04:04.633 --> 01:04:06.634
Since I was nine.

01:04:09.429 --> 01:04:11.639
I'm sorry, Rabbit.

01:04:14.184 --> 01:04:17.436
He hurts you, doesn't he?

01:04:17.604 --> 01:04:22.399
When he feels like
he should, yes.

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:32.451
If you-- if you wanna have sex,
I'll have sex with you.

01:04:32.619 --> 01:04:34.995
I'll do any-- anything you want.

01:04:35.163 --> 01:04:36.705
I don't want anything.

01:04:39.251 --> 01:04:40.918
This isn't about sex.

01:04:43.296 --> 01:04:46.507
Then-- then what is it about?

01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:52.846
I guess it is about sex
if sex involves killing.

01:04:54.599 --> 01:04:56.517
Oh, shit.

01:04:57.852 --> 01:04:59.979
But I haven't done either.

01:05:10.532 --> 01:05:14.451
Have you ever touched a girl?

01:05:20.667 --> 01:05:23.627
You can touch me, Rabbit.

01:05:23.795 --> 01:05:27.506
You can touch me
however you want.

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:32.386
I can show you--

01:05:32.554 --> 01:05:34.847
I can show you
how my body works.

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:39.393
I already know
how your body works.

01:05:53.199 --> 01:05:56.035
You can have me.

01:05:56.202 --> 01:05:59.830
We will do whatever you want.

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.724
Am I hurting you?

01:06:23.438 --> 01:06:25.230
Are you okay?

01:06:33.531 --> 01:06:36.784
Shh, shh.
Shh.

01:06:43.458 --> 01:06:45.501
- Look at me. Look at me.
- Shh.

01:06:45.669 --> 01:06:48.629
Shh, shh.

01:06:49.881 --> 01:06:51.965
(muffled speech)

01:06:52.133 --> 01:06:53.676
Rabbit.

01:06:55.178 --> 01:06:57.596
- Rabbit!
- Please.

01:06:57.764 --> 01:07:00.432
Rabbit!

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.017
(knife pierces)

01:07:11.277 --> 01:07:16.740
Go away!

01:07:18.702 --> 01:07:20.703
(clock ticking)

01:07:28.336 --> 01:07:30.337
(door opens)

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:44.476
(door slams)

01:08:29.731 --> 01:08:31.774
I want to hunt.

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:38.906
God damn.

01:08:39.073 --> 01:08:40.948
Look who's all grown up.

01:10:15.879 --> 01:10:19.047
(footsteps approach)

01:10:23.261 --> 01:10:26.513
Look at you.
Turn around.

01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:35.731
Good.

01:10:35.899 --> 01:10:38.400
What do you think?

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:40.485
- About what?
- The chair.

01:10:44.324 --> 01:10:47.367
- Mine?
- Graduation present.

01:11:13.686 --> 01:11:16.813
- It's good.
- Good.

01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:51.932
Front passenger side
of the vehicle.

01:12:16.749 --> 01:12:18.709
Mom's voice:
Hey, hon. It's us.

01:12:18.876 --> 01:12:20.919
We are in a cab
and we're on our way home.

01:12:21.087 --> 01:12:22.337
Love you.

01:12:22.505 --> 01:12:24.381
Young Rabbit's voice:
Leave her alone! No!

01:12:24.549 --> 01:12:27.592
- Mom!
- Mom's voice: No! Stay in the car!

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:31.638
(overlapping shouting)

01:12:31.806 --> 01:12:34.808
Bob: Let's go.
Let's go.

01:12:34.976 --> 01:12:37.978
Let's go. Let's go.

01:12:42.483 --> 01:12:46.570
Um, so you have to tuck down

01:12:46.738 --> 01:12:48.739
until we get into town.

01:12:51.617 --> 01:12:54.786
There we go.
That's good.

01:13:06.632 --> 01:13:08.175
Bob:
I feel energized.

01:13:09.177 --> 01:13:11.762
At night is the best time to hunt.

01:13:13.347 --> 01:13:15.599
My vision is clear.

01:13:16.934 --> 01:13:19.811
I'm good

01:13:19.979 --> 01:13:23.106
being here with you now.

01:13:23.274 --> 01:13:24.983
This is good.

01:13:29.572 --> 01:13:31.323
You're a good kid.

01:13:35.036 --> 01:13:38.872
The first thing that
you have to be clear about

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:42.334
is your type.

01:13:44.128 --> 01:13:46.588
If you're into prostitution,

01:13:46.756 --> 01:13:49.007
maybe get a few of them
under your belt,

01:13:49.175 --> 01:13:52.135
and then move
onto something else.

01:13:55.598 --> 01:13:58.934
If you come across
one like that--

01:13:59.102 --> 01:14:01.812
look at her,

01:14:01.979 --> 01:14:06.608
all buttoned up like she's never
sucked on a cock before.

01:14:06.776 --> 01:14:09.111
Well, you can bet that she has.

01:14:13.241 --> 01:14:14.866
No.

01:14:15.034 --> 01:14:16.493
Okay.

01:14:21.374 --> 01:14:22.916
Rabbit:
Where next?

01:14:23.084 --> 01:14:24.835
Going to a college campus.

01:14:25.002 --> 01:14:27.170
Girls your age.

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:31.842
- Like Angie?
- Yes, like Angie.

01:14:33.386 --> 01:14:35.720
l-l don't know.

01:14:42.228 --> 01:14:45.522
Maybe this is too much too soon.

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:50.277
We'll go back home.

01:14:51.529 --> 01:14:54.614
We could watch the movie
of your first time.

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:01.079
You made a movie
of me and Angie?

01:15:01.247 --> 01:15:03.248
Yes, I did.
I haven't watched it yet.

01:15:03.416 --> 01:15:05.083
That-- that's my private thing.

01:15:05.251 --> 01:15:08.003
I-- I don't want you to see
what I did.

01:15:08.171 --> 01:15:12.507
I told you, I will watch it,
and you will watch it with me.

01:15:12.675 --> 01:15:15.010
It's important.

01:15:15.178 --> 01:15:16.678
You won't like it.

01:15:16.846 --> 01:15:18.972
I-- I don't do it--

01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:22.058
I'm not good at it like you are.
You'll be mad.

01:15:22.226 --> 01:15:25.604
You can't do it wrong, Rabbit.

01:15:27.607 --> 01:15:32.152
I'll drive by the college campus,
then we'll go home.

01:15:35.531 --> 01:15:37.199
(police radio chatter)

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:39.284
Bob:
Get down.

01:15:56.427 --> 01:15:58.303
Okay.

01:16:10.816 --> 01:16:12.567
Bob:
What did you do?

01:16:12.735 --> 01:16:14.402
No, nothing.
I did everything you wanted.

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:16.529
- Shut up!
- (punches)

01:16:42.974 --> 01:16:44.391
Have some fun.

01:16:45.810 --> 01:16:49.020
- Am I hurting you?
- If you can't do it, I will.

01:16:53.025 --> 01:16:54.526
Go away!

01:16:58.239 --> 01:17:01.241
- Angie. No, shh!
- (gasping)

01:17:01.409 --> 01:17:02.826
- (whimpering)
- Shh, shh.

01:17:02.994 --> 01:17:07.163
Okay, okay.
Shh. Shh.

01:17:08.874 --> 01:17:10.750
I know-- I know
I hurt you real bad,

01:17:10.918 --> 01:17:13.253
but you just gotta
stay quiet, okay?

01:17:13.421 --> 01:17:14.713
You stabbed me.

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:16.214
I know.

01:17:16.382 --> 01:17:19.426
I had to or he would have.

01:17:25.558 --> 01:17:28.601
I tried to miss the vital organs.

01:17:29.687 --> 01:17:31.354
I think I did okay.

01:17:31.522 --> 01:17:34.482
How do you know?
Look at me. Look at me.

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:37.152
I told you.
I told you.

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:39.362
I know how your body works.

01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:42.449
I've been studying.
You'll be okay.

01:17:42.616 --> 01:17:45.410
You'll be okay
for about two days,

01:17:45.578 --> 01:17:48.288
and then you're gonna get
really sick.

01:17:48.456 --> 01:17:50.999
Two days?

01:17:53.377 --> 01:17:58.173
- (cries out)
- Shh!

01:17:58.341 --> 01:18:00.842
Shh.
Okay, shh.

01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:04.095
I have to hide you.

01:18:04.263 --> 01:18:07.182
I have to-- I have to make him
think that you're dead.

01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:09.100
(crying)
Oh, God. No.

01:18:09.268 --> 01:18:11.811
Okay, you have to trust me.

01:18:11.979 --> 01:18:14.022
Okay?

01:18:14.190 --> 01:18:18.318
You have to trust me.
Okay?

01:18:18.486 --> 01:18:21.863
Go limp.
Just go limp.

01:18:22.031 --> 01:18:24.324
And don't you make any noise.

01:18:24.492 --> 01:18:26.743
Don't make any noise.

01:18:26.911 --> 01:18:29.287
Dead girls don't make any noise.

01:18:34.335 --> 01:18:36.419
I've seen a lot of dead girls.

01:18:42.134 --> 01:18:45.178
Take this.
It's sharp.

01:19:05.533 --> 01:19:08.618
Please. Please.

01:19:10.704 --> 01:19:13.498
(crying)

01:19:19.463 --> 01:19:21.464
(garage door opens)

01:19:27.346 --> 01:19:29.347
(garage door closes)

01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:35.437
You need to fix this, Rabbit.

01:19:37.731 --> 01:19:40.483
I'm really disappointed.

01:19:42.528 --> 01:19:44.362
You need to make it right.

01:19:47.783 --> 01:19:52.871
And don't further insult me

01:19:53.038 --> 01:19:56.458
by pretending
like you don't hear me!

01:20:00.546 --> 01:20:02.297
You fuck her?

01:20:04.842 --> 01:20:06.759
Probably not.

01:20:08.304 --> 01:20:11.097
I mean, you could have
at least fucked her.

01:20:12.433 --> 01:20:17.187
You didn't have to lie to me.
I would have done the rest.

01:20:17.354 --> 01:20:19.397
I gotta do it now anyway.

01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:48.927
I don't like that
you fuckin' lied to me!

01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:13.743
Angie!

01:21:26.507 --> 01:21:28.591
Angie.

01:21:29.802 --> 01:21:32.804
I got a surprising little secret.

01:21:57.371 --> 01:21:58.788
How are you doing, young lady?

01:22:01.375 --> 01:22:02.417
Angie!

01:22:02.585 --> 01:22:04.919
- Angie!
- How're you doing, Ange?

01:22:21.478 --> 01:22:23.521
Rabbit:
Angie! Don't hurt her!

01:22:23.689 --> 01:22:26.608
Bob:
Angie!

01:22:26.775 --> 01:22:28.735
Ah, fuck!

01:22:31.196 --> 01:22:33.615
(screaming)

01:22:33.782 --> 01:22:35.908
Rabbit:
Angie!

01:22:38.329 --> 01:22:40.496
Angie. Angie!

01:22:40.664 --> 01:22:42.957
Come here, you fucking whore!

01:22:45.544 --> 01:22:48.838
Rabbit: No!
(yelling)

01:22:54.511 --> 01:22:57.096
- Get off of me!
- What did you do?!

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:13.071
(groaning)

01:23:13.238 --> 01:23:15.531
Fuck.

01:23:20.621 --> 01:23:22.830
I knew that you were thinking it.

01:23:22.998 --> 01:23:25.375
Shut up.

01:23:25.542 --> 01:23:27.835
Rabbit,

01:23:28.003 --> 01:23:29.629
you can't do this.

01:23:44.645 --> 01:23:46.729
Rabbit.

01:24:39.950 --> 01:24:41.951
(dog barking)

01:24:46.915 --> 01:24:49.167
(doorbell rings)

01:24:49.334 --> 01:24:51.794
Marie, the dog should be out back.

01:24:52.921 --> 01:24:55.757
What you selling?

01:24:56.884 --> 01:24:58.468
You don't recognize me?

01:24:58.635 --> 01:25:00.178
No, I don't.
Should I?

01:25:01.722 --> 01:25:03.556
I always wanted a puppy.

01:25:03.724 --> 01:25:05.516
Yeah, well, I'm about ready
to give you ours.

01:25:05.684 --> 01:25:07.852
- Come on, Marie.
- You said we couldn't afford it.

01:25:09.146 --> 01:25:11.856
I said what?

01:25:16.278 --> 01:25:18.696
- Tim?
- I'm so sorry.

01:25:20.824 --> 01:25:24.994
- Tim, is that you?
- Tim?

01:25:25.162 --> 01:25:27.663
Your son Tim?

01:25:27.831 --> 01:25:30.666
My, God, Tim, you're alive.

01:25:37.090 --> 01:25:39.008
Take the puppy out back.
Go on.

01:25:39.176 --> 01:25:41.427
Take the puppy.
Go, go, go.

01:25:41.595 --> 01:25:43.513
Come in, then.
Come in.

01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:46.057
Marie: Come in, hon.
Please, come.

01:25:50.354 --> 01:25:51.604
Come in, son.
Come in.

01:25:51.772 --> 01:25:53.523
(door closes)

01:25:53.690 --> 01:25:56.400
How-- how did you find me?

01:25:59.363 --> 01:26:00.738
Where have you been?

01:26:04.535 --> 01:26:06.869
Where have you been, Tim?

01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:12.750
He-- he killed Mom.

01:26:14.795 --> 01:26:16.921
I'm so sorry.

01:26:17.089 --> 01:26:19.590
You're safe now, honey.

01:26:19.758 --> 01:26:22.134
I just wanna know why, Dad.

01:26:25.764 --> 01:26:29.600
- You gave this to your brother.
- Oh, no.

01:26:29.768 --> 01:26:32.061
Honey, he doesn't have a brother.
You're confused.

01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:34.689
He doesn't-- you--
you don't have a brother.

01:26:34.857 --> 01:26:36.482
- No, I don't have a brother.
- Like old hand-me-down clothes,

01:26:36.650 --> 01:26:40.152
you just-- you just gave us away.

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:41.904
Tim, I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:26:42.072 --> 01:26:44.782
You told me to look after Mom.

01:26:49.454 --> 01:26:51.747
I was just a kid
and I couldn't save her,

01:26:51.915 --> 01:26:53.958
and you knew I couldn't save her.

01:26:54.126 --> 01:26:55.626
- You knew.
- Boy: Mom, Dad,

01:26:55.794 --> 01:26:57.795
is everything all right?

01:26:59.256 --> 01:27:00.756
I have a brother.

01:27:00.924 --> 01:27:03.968
Hey, Marie, take Colin upstairs.

01:27:04.136 --> 01:27:06.095
Tim and I need to have a little talk.

01:27:06.263 --> 01:27:09.140
Go on.
Go up the stairs.

01:27:10.893 --> 01:27:13.144
In one ear and out the window.

01:27:14.771 --> 01:27:17.315
Get up the stairs, Marie.

01:27:17.482 --> 01:27:20.818
Now! Get up the fucking stairs!

01:27:24.698 --> 01:27:26.449
I found your letter.

01:27:29.536 --> 01:27:32.538
I know where you came from
and I know everything.

01:27:33.624 --> 01:27:36.500
Robert Fittler,
your older brother--

01:27:36.668 --> 01:27:39.962
you paid him
to make us go away.

01:27:42.883 --> 01:27:44.508
And I'm gonna tell.

01:27:47.679 --> 01:27:49.764
You're gonna tell on me?

01:27:52.225 --> 01:27:53.935
Hmm?

01:27:57.481 --> 01:27:59.565
Go on, get out of here.

01:27:59.733 --> 01:28:01.609
You should never have come
to my house.

01:28:01.777 --> 01:28:02.944
Go on.

01:28:04.488 --> 01:28:05.488
I don't even wanna look at you.

01:28:06.490 --> 01:28:07.531
Brad, Brad!

01:28:07.699 --> 01:28:08.699
- Please! Please!
- Rabbit: I'm gonna tell.

01:28:08.867 --> 01:28:11.869
- Goddamn, disgusting piece of shit.
- Marie: Stop! No more!

01:28:12.037 --> 01:28:13.663
Stop!

01:28:21.254 --> 01:28:23.756
Marie: Okay, okay.
Okay, baby.

01:28:23.924 --> 01:28:25.883
Baby, baby.

01:28:26.051 --> 01:28:27.927
- (panting)
- Quiet.

01:28:28.095 --> 01:28:30.638
It's-- it's--

01:28:30.806 --> 01:28:32.056
it's okay.

01:28:32.224 --> 01:28:33.641
It's o-- ah!

01:28:33.809 --> 01:28:37.186
- (muffled screaming)
- Be quiet.

01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:42.942
- Don't hurt her!
- (gasps)

01:28:53.745 --> 01:28:56.747
(gurgling)

01:29:02.045 --> 01:29:05.506
Okay, okay.

01:29:32.367 --> 01:29:35.327
Colin:
Mom? Mom?

01:29:35.495 --> 01:29:38.080
Stay in your room, Colin!

01:29:50.302 --> 01:29:52.845
(clatters)

01:29:57.726 --> 01:29:59.560
(crying)
You need to go.

01:29:59.728 --> 01:30:02.438
Go now, okay?

01:30:02.606 --> 01:30:07.068
Go.

01:30:09.654 --> 01:30:12.198
Go!

01:30:12.365 --> 01:30:15.659
Go! Go!

01:30:15.827 --> 01:30:17.912
(door opens, closes)

01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:20.956
Colin:
Mom, what's happening?

01:30:21.124 --> 01:30:23.542
- Mom?
- Don't you dare come down here.

01:30:23.710 --> 01:30:25.961
Stay in your room, Colin.

01:30:28.965 --> 01:30:31.717
Some man broke into my house.

01:30:31.885 --> 01:30:34.595
I-- I think they killed my husband.

01:30:34.763 --> 01:30:37.598
Colin:
No! Daddy!

01:31:29.192 --> 01:31:31.193
