00:00.366 --> 00:07.424
Look at me. And look at the Queen.
I was never a fan until it
occurred to me how much

00:07.427 --> 00:08.986
me and Ma'am have in common.

00:08.987 --> 00:11.586
Bringing up kiddies you can't
remember the names of.

00:11.596 --> 00:13.595
And I know she's not
a single parent,

00:13.596 --> 00:15.517
but she might as well be. Plus...

00:15.614 --> 00:17.892
the pair of us,
we've stuck to our guns -

00:17.967 --> 00:19.285
her, literally, sometimes -

00:19.286 --> 00:20.927
and flagshipped a dying breed.

00:20.928 --> 00:23.526
Admired and despised equally.

00:23.527 --> 00:25.047
Not for never lifting a finger.

00:25.048 --> 00:28.806
No - for setting examples
through extremity.

00:28.807 --> 00:31.445
And whether you're a bigwig on her
end or a bigwig on mine,

00:31.446 --> 00:34.445
you've still got all your dickheads
in the middle to deal with - snip,

00:34.446 --> 00:36.165
snip, snipping at your benefits.

00:36.334 --> 00:39.053
I mean, she can't not be
looking at me and thinking -

00:39.084 --> 00:43.085
"What's your secret, Frank?"
I got shot of my kids yonks back.

00:44.085 --> 00:46.963
Whereas she's yet to see
the back of a single one. Fine!

00:46.964 --> 00:48.883
I've had to get
out of bed on occasion

00:48.884 --> 00:51.205
to make ends meet,
whereas she's done

00:51.206 --> 00:53.324
the whole thing from a chair.

00:53.325 --> 00:56.444
Oh, and a drink for the lady.

00:56.445 --> 00:57.923
Oh, sure, there's perks.

00:57.924 --> 00:59.005
But look at her lot.

00:59.006 --> 01:02.124
Brian May prancing about
on her roof.

01:02.125 --> 01:03.964
Now look at my lot...

01:03.965 --> 01:08.083
we know how to throw
a proper fucking paaaarty!

02:40.842 --> 02:43.000
Oh, cheer up, you miserable git!

02:43.001 --> 02:44.840
If I was you, I'd never stop
smiling.

02:44.841 --> 02:46.520
Running my own business at your age?

02:46.521 --> 02:48.682
- Even if it is a bit...
- A bit what?

02:48.683 --> 02:52.521
Corner shop-y.

02:52.522 --> 02:54.920
If it was mine,
I'd probably brighten things up,

02:54.921 --> 02:58.922
make it the sort of place customers
want to hang out in, you know.

02:59.442 --> 03:01.080
Well, it's not yours, is it?

03:01.081 --> 03:05.082

comes you're always hanging out here?

Whoa! Ches ? what's going on, man?

03:11.882 --> 03:13.681
Fucking motor's gone!

03:13.682 --> 03:16.961
These are free now, mate.

03:16.962 --> 03:20.962
C'mon, dickhead.

03:22.442 --> 03:23.881
Rough day?

03:23.882 --> 03:25.962
You could say that. Staff cutbacks.

03:25.963 --> 03:27.681
They've let me go.

03:27.682 --> 03:29.001
Shit, I'm sorry.

03:29.002 --> 03:31.800
It's not that I'm worried about.
It's telling our Patreesha.

03:31.801 --> 03:33.802
She'll be OK about it, won't she?

03:33.803 --> 03:37.802
She'll be sympathetic.

03:38.242 --> 03:40.882
Very sympathetic.

03:42.122 --> 03:45.001
Yeah, yeah, all right, all right.

03:45.002 --> 03:49.002
Drink it in, ladies!

03:49.122 --> 03:51.521
Fuck me, which one's Mr Pink?

03:51.522 --> 03:54.880
It's called class, Frank.
Some of us are born with it,

03:54.881 --> 03:58.082
and some of us get a slap round
the face for being a cheeky prick.

03:58.083 --> 04:02.082
Big pro-footballers birthday bash.
All VIP, of course.

04:02.562 --> 04:06.441
But if you're a close
friend of, ahem, Joe Hart...

04:06.442 --> 04:10.442
Whit woo! What do you reckon, Karen?

04:10.642 --> 04:13.361
- Scrub up all right these lot, don't they?
- Don't they just?

04:13.362 --> 04:15.201
Can I have this dance?

04:15.202 --> 04:17.841
Of course!

04:17.841 --> 04:19.761
Did you sort the car?

04:19.762 --> 04:21.401
Yeah. Parked out front.

04:21.402 --> 04:23.520
The only way to make
an entrance, Frank.

04:23.521 --> 04:26.720
Well, I hate to break it to you,
what with me being nothing

04:26.721 --> 04:28.922
but an un-hosed proletariat
and all...

04:28.923 --> 04:30.761
but isn't today the 14th?

04:30.762 --> 04:34.161
You what?

04:34.162 --> 04:36.561
The party was yesterday, you dick!

04:36.562 --> 04:38.081
Oh, fuck nuts!

04:38.082 --> 04:41.481
See, you can't buy class like that.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.002
Didn't you look at them?!

04:43.003 --> 04:47.002
Calm down. A setback is just
a new opportunity.

04:47.082 --> 04:51.082
We have a free evening, a five-star
hotel on wheels parked out front,

04:52.482 --> 04:56.482
and none of us has to drive.

04:56.802 --> 04:59.362
If you need someone to make up
the numbers...?

04:59.363 --> 05:03.362
Sorry, Frank. Strict dress code.

Off you go.

05:27.242 --> 05:30.201
Earning their chemical
warfare badges?

05:30.202 --> 05:32.240
Got them at a military
antique store.

05:32.241 --> 05:34.640
Used them as first
prize in the club-house raffle.

05:34.641 --> 05:38.642
Pissed on that junior cricket
set their headmaster donated.

05:42.002 --> 05:45.401
Right. What can I do for you?

05:45.402 --> 05:48.562
Says you're flogging your shop.
How much for that chiller cabinet?

05:48.563 --> 05:52.562
Well, it's difficult to say.

05:53.122 --> 05:56.721
Make me an offer.

05:56.722 --> 05:58.121
I've got 300 on me.

05:58.122 --> 05:59.761
It's 305. Sorry.

05:59.762 --> 06:01.042
What? Well, can't you...

06:01.043 --> 06:02.841
Oh, I'm joking.

06:02.842 --> 06:05.560
God, you're a bit of a serious
one, aren't you? Lighten up a bit.

06:05.561 --> 06:08.802
Look, do you think I want to spend me
evening here haggling over a fridge?

06:08.803 --> 06:10.961
Are you selling it or not?

06:10.962 --> 06:14.962
Well, I might consider it if you
go outside, come back in again

06:15.562 --> 06:18.761
and ask me nicely.

06:18.762 --> 06:22.762
Ask me nicely.

06:30.802 --> 06:33.562
Excuse me.
May I buy your chiller cabinet?

06:33.563 --> 06:37.562
Please.

06:37.642 --> 06:40.441
Ohhhh, you poor thing.

06:40.442 --> 06:43.441
It'll be fine.
Something will come up.

06:43.442 --> 06:47.161
Unemployed... at your age.

06:47.162 --> 06:48.321
Ta.

06:48.322 --> 06:50.761
- What are you going to do about it, Mum?
- Well...

06:50.762 --> 06:53.200
Your mother is a very
determined woman.

06:53.201 --> 06:57.000
There's always work out there
if you're prepared to
lower your standards a little.

06:57.001 --> 07:00.282
Maybe I'll try becoming
a lady of leisure for a bit...

07:00.283 --> 07:02.121
like you.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.321
I'm hardly a lady of leisure.

07:04.322 --> 07:07.760
I'm on the board of directors for
mine and Bernard's business empire,
remember?

07:07.761 --> 07:09.000
Oh, you mean the car wash?

07:09.001 --> 07:11.560
Since when did you have
anything to do with that?

07:11.561 --> 07:13.080
I oversee it all from a distance.

07:13.081 --> 07:15.760
Yeah, on the sofa,
watching Jeremy Kyle.

07:15.761 --> 07:17.080
I could get you a job there.

07:17.081 --> 07:18.760
I don't want to work in a car wash.

07:18.761 --> 07:21.522
I'll have a word tomorrow,
see if I can sort you something out.

07:21.523 --> 07:25.522
I don't know what you'd do
without me sometimes.

07:25.802 --> 07:29.641
Right, here we are.
Got to keep the VAT man happy.

07:29.642 --> 07:32.081
Democracy isn't free, you know?

07:32.082 --> 07:33.640
How comes you're selling up?

07:33.641 --> 07:36.240
I just work here. It's the owner
that's selling it -

07:36.241 --> 07:39.400
him and his partner opening up
some place in Ibiza.

07:39.401 --> 07:42.922
Can't say I'll miss it. I was
getting too comfy here, anyway.

07:42.923 --> 07:44.681
Itchy feet.

07:44.682 --> 07:45.920
I know the feeling.

07:45.921 --> 07:49.682
Oh, please! If I'd have had your
sense, running my own business
at 19,

07:49.683 --> 07:53.682
I'd have owned
half the world by now.

07:54.002 --> 07:58.002
You should tuck your shirt in.

08:24.202 --> 08:28.202
I'm telling you, Cool Britannia...
We had it all then.

08:28.762 --> 08:31.241
You know what fucked it all up?

08:31.242 --> 08:33.280
Tony Blair.
Things Can Only Get Better?

08:33.280 --> 08:35.760
Nah, nah, nah.
It was never about the Government.

08:35.760 --> 08:38.761
Tory, Labour, right?
One man killed it for us all.

08:38.763 --> 08:42.761
26th of June, 1996.

08:43.602 --> 08:45.801
Gareth fucking Southgate!

08:45.802 --> 08:48.720
Gareth Southgate.
Because we believed, you see?

08:48.721 --> 08:52.722
And then some long-faced gimp kicks
left instead of right and BANG.

08:52.723 --> 08:56.722
The greatest single
decade in British history is over.

08:58.482 --> 09:01.881
That was 17 years ago.

09:01.882 --> 09:04.201
Fuuuck!

09:04.202 --> 09:07.161
Right. If you could go back?

09:07.162 --> 09:10.042
To '96, '97, whatever, talk to
yourself...

09:10.043 --> 09:11.921
do things different...

09:11.922 --> 09:13.200
what would you change?

09:13.201 --> 09:17.202
I spent the whole of my late teens
chasing Sarah Laymon...

09:17.762 --> 09:21.762
Remember her? Ended up being best
man at her civil partnership.

09:22.842 --> 09:24.161
Wasted years. Yeah.

09:24.162 --> 09:28.162
Most of mine surrounded by four grey
walls and a fucking slop bucket.

09:28.282 --> 09:30.760
But you make the best,
you pull yourself up again.

09:30.761 --> 09:32.122
But you never get them back.

09:32.123 --> 09:35.241
And you'll always
wonder... What about you?

09:35.242 --> 09:37.041
No, nothing.

09:37.042 --> 09:39.082
Come on,
everyone wants to change something.

09:39.083 --> 09:40.961
No, no, not me.

09:40.962 --> 09:44.082
Been around, seen the world,
found my soulmate

09:44.083 --> 09:46.961
and got the perfect kids
to show for it.

09:46.962 --> 09:50.962
Wouldn't change a thing.

10:13.882 --> 10:16.081
I'll sort it.

10:16.082 --> 10:20.082
No, no, no.
I rented it, let me have a word.

10:24.682 --> 10:28.241
Kassi Blanco?!

10:28.242 --> 10:29.961
Disappointed, Blanco.

10:29.962 --> 10:32.322
Money laundering,
fraud by misrepresentation

10:32.323 --> 10:36.322
and then you hire
this in your own name.

10:37.802 --> 10:39.332
Call Esther.

10:46.504 --> 10:48.183
Refused bail...

10:48.184 --> 10:50.903
and they won't let us see him.

10:50.904 --> 10:53.262
I'll sort this, Esther.
We'll sort this.

10:53.263 --> 10:55.942
Oh, you know Kassi,
par for the course.

10:55.943 --> 10:57.784
Better get back,
whole load of food to prep.

10:57.785 --> 11:00.223
Proper behind sched now.

11:00.224 --> 11:02.144
I couldn't bag a hand
off you, could I?

11:02.145 --> 11:04.223
Big order for Tuesday.

11:04.224 --> 11:08.224
Yeah.

11:11.304 --> 11:12.703
Oh, there you are.

11:12.704 --> 11:15.064
Boys have got it all
cleaned up for you.

11:15.065 --> 11:19.064
Perks of Arkaladom.
I can see how fascism starts.

11:19.304 --> 11:23.304
And what you giving them for their
trouble today? Land mines?

11:24.024 --> 11:28.024
Any one of those boys would walk
through a hail of gunfire for me.

11:28.344 --> 11:31.982
I shan't ask them to, though -
some parent would have a shit-fit!

11:31.983 --> 11:34.902
Right, shall we get this
in your van, then?

11:34.903 --> 11:36.622
So, this cabinet you're buying,

11:36.623 --> 11:39.944
it's part of some refurbishment
you're doing, then?

11:39.945 --> 11:42.663
Nah, just needed a new one.

11:42.664 --> 11:44.903
A big refurbishment?

11:44.904 --> 11:46.103
Well...

11:46.104 --> 11:48.623
I mean, I've been thinking lately

11:48.624 --> 11:50.544
I could probably do a lot more
with the place.

11:50.545 --> 11:54.263
Thinking, eh? Anyone can think,
Chesney. I can think.

11:54.264 --> 11:58.264
Don't you ever
want to just do it?

11:59.344 --> 12:00.943
Are you OK?

12:00.944 --> 12:03.623
Yeah, yeah.

12:03.624 --> 12:07.024
What if I wanted more than just
the chiller cabinet?

12:07.025 --> 12:11.024
Well, it's all up for grabs, Ches.
What you after?

12:12.544 --> 12:16.544
All of it.

12:17.064 --> 12:19.183
Tam?

12:19.184 --> 12:20.583
He's gone out.

12:20.584 --> 12:22.182
God knows what they'll be up to!

12:22.183 --> 12:24.342
Last time he was
on baby-sitting duties

12:24.343 --> 12:26.102
he got our Saul's face painted.

12:26.103 --> 12:28.102
Full-on black-and-white minstrel.

12:28.103 --> 12:31.222
Claims he thought it was a panda,
but I reckon he knew.

12:31.223 --> 12:34.062
Couldn't get it off for days, had
to take him for his jabs like that.

12:34.063 --> 12:36.464
Doctor Abonzo really didn't
see the funny side.

12:36.465 --> 12:39.743
So, what are you going to tell them?
The kids?

12:39.744 --> 12:40.783
About what?

12:40.784 --> 12:41.903
Kassi?

12:41.904 --> 12:43.342
No point fretting 'em.

12:43.343 --> 12:45.062
I'll say he's on business
for a few days.

12:45.063 --> 12:46.542
He'll be back
by the end of the week.

12:46.543 --> 12:47.822
He's been refused bail!

12:47.823 --> 12:50.302
Well, he would be.
Skipped on it before.

12:50.303 --> 12:53.984
I appreciate the concern but it's
nothing to worry about. Honestly.

12:53.985 --> 12:57.984
Start stirring this. Clockwise.
Do you want to help?

12:58.824 --> 13:02.824
No, I don't.

13:10.904 --> 13:12.822
It's because I'll be your
boss, isn't it?

13:12.823 --> 13:15.383
- That's what all the pissing
and moaning's about.
- No.

13:15.445 --> 13:17.283
It's cos I don't want
to work in a car wash.

13:17.284 --> 13:19.403
Have you ever heard the expression,
"Beggars can't be choosers"?

13:19.404 --> 13:21.803
Have you ever heard
the expression, "Fuck off"?

13:21.804 --> 13:24.763
Only looking out for you,
just like I always have.

13:24.764 --> 13:27.285
And, by the way,
it's not a car wash...

13:27.286 --> 13:31.285
it's the car wash -
South Manchester's finest.

13:31.685 --> 13:34.045
We take three times what all
the others make round here.

13:34.046 --> 13:36.204
This place? How?

13:36.205 --> 13:38.844
Because I'm in charge, naturally.

13:38.845 --> 13:40.485
Have you ever actually been inside?

13:40.486 --> 13:44.485
No! Exciting, isn't it?

13:45.005 --> 13:48.405
It's like Mary Portas
marching into Harvey Nicks.

13:48.406 --> 13:52.405
Yeah. That's exactly what it's
like!

13:54.885 --> 13:57.084
Yep... it's a shit-hole.

13:57.085 --> 13:59.645
But it won't be -
I'll take everything from yours.

13:59.646 --> 14:01.764
All your olde-worlde shit.

14:01.765 --> 14:05.765
Mod meets classic.
Local shop and chemist's.

14:06.245 --> 14:09.965
Well, you just might own the world
by time you're 40 after all.

14:09.966 --> 14:12.484
Aren't you clever?

14:12.485 --> 14:14.643
Mind you, if you're going
to open a chemist's

14:14.644 --> 14:16.085
you're going to need someone

14:16.086 --> 14:19.684
with a Pharmacist Practitioner
licence, aren't you?

14:19.685 --> 14:23.084
You need me.

14:23.085 --> 14:24.283
You want to work for me?

14:24.284 --> 14:27.123
Do I fuck?! I want to work
with you - partners.

14:27.124 --> 14:28.923
Just to get you started anyway -

14:28.924 --> 14:30.563
wouldn't want to hang
around too long,

14:30.564 --> 14:31.925
I've still got plans of my own.

14:31.926 --> 14:35.925
Until then, Ches,
let's face it... you need me.

14:55.045 --> 14:56.444
Who was that?

14:56.445 --> 15:00.445
Oh, Remona. She's amazing.
We're going into business together.

15:00.645 --> 15:02.083
Chesco's getting an upgrade!

15:02.084 --> 15:04.043
You never said anything
about this before.

15:04.044 --> 15:05.443
She just got me thinking.

15:05.444 --> 15:09.445
You know, I'm 21, doing all right,
should want a bit more out of life.

15:09.885 --> 15:11.923
That's exactly what
I said, isn't it?

15:11.924 --> 15:13.563
Maybe she just phrased it better?

15:13.564 --> 15:16.123
I'll bet. Knowing Ches,
she phrased it better

15:16.124 --> 15:17.363
with a cleavage you could
park a Harley in.

15:17.364 --> 15:19.165
Fuck off! I don't fancy her!

15:19.166 --> 15:21.604
Yeah, sounds like it.

15:21.605 --> 15:25.605
M-M-Mwah! Whatever.

15:25.725 --> 15:29.725
Patreesha. Patreesha St Rose?

15:30.925 --> 15:33.843
So, er, do you want a car
doing, then, or...?

15:33.844 --> 15:35.605
All right, where's the manager?

15:35.606 --> 15:38.165
'Mr Black Mercedes is in again.'

15:40.725 --> 15:43.725
Manager?

15:49.765 --> 15:52.124
There you go, love.

15:52.125 --> 15:54.084
I can't say I'm surprised.

15:54.085 --> 15:58.085
Could see he was a wrong-un from
the off. Nature versus nurture.

15:58.925 --> 16:00.683
Never had your upbringing, see?

16:00.684 --> 16:04.165
You do realise that all three of
us have been prison at least once?

16:04.166 --> 16:07.324
Yeah, but for proper fucking stuff.

16:07.325 --> 16:09.683
Not signing forms in the wrong
name, or whatever.

16:09.684 --> 16:12.283
Anyway, these days,
we're respectable.

16:12.284 --> 16:14.685
How's the magic mushroom
business going, Mum?

16:14.686 --> 16:16.524
Really good, son.

16:16.525 --> 16:20.525
Oh, good.

16:26.285 --> 16:28.804
Unexpected item in the bagging area.

16:28.805 --> 16:31.004
Lovely.

16:31.005 --> 16:33.765
Oh, here she is! Hey, I missed
my alarm call this morning.

16:33.766 --> 16:35.004
What alarm call?

16:35.005 --> 16:36.963
You and lover boy's
morning delight -

16:36.964 --> 16:38.765
headboard shaking us out of bed.

16:38.766 --> 16:41.444
Aw, soz, Frank. He's away all week.

16:41.445 --> 16:43.645
I'll try and rattle
it for you on my own!

16:43.646 --> 16:47.645
That's the spirit.

16:48.045 --> 16:50.364
Last time.

16:50.365 --> 16:52.684
Did she say anything?

16:52.685 --> 16:53.885
She said loads of stuff.

16:53.886 --> 16:55.204
Like...?

16:55.205 --> 16:58.565
Like, "Dough rises fastest
at 80 degree temperatures."

16:58.566 --> 17:01.364
That's true.

17:01.365 --> 17:02.604
Well, it is!

17:02.605 --> 17:05.403
Husband's looking at ten years
and she's running cookery classes

17:05.404 --> 17:07.444
and pissing about with Gallagher.

17:07.445 --> 17:10.003
I just don't get the woman.

17:10.005 --> 17:12.403
She'll do anything you like,
she's not proud, my sister.

17:12.404 --> 17:14.525
You can get her scrubbing
the toilets if you want.

17:14.526 --> 17:18.525
I'm not hiring anyone until
I've spoken with your, er...

17:19.765 --> 17:23.765
..husband.

17:29.365 --> 17:32.364
Well?

17:32.365 --> 17:34.044
You know what he said?

17:34.045 --> 17:36.523
You can have a job but you'll
be scrubbing the toilets.

17:36.524 --> 17:39.805
I told him no sister of mine
will be doing any such thing.

17:39.806 --> 17:41.364
Right...

17:41.365 --> 17:44.925
Can we go home now, then?
We're missing Jeremy Kyle.

17:44.926 --> 17:48.244
Jeremy Kyle finished two hours ago.

17:48.245 --> 17:49.725
Oh, shut up!

18:09.805 --> 18:13.324
It's a drive through suck shop!

18:13.325 --> 18:15.765
"I'm going to walk in there
like Mary Portas!"

18:15.766 --> 18:17.604
More like Heidi Fleis!

18:17.605 --> 18:19.003
Well, it won't be funny for them.

18:19.004 --> 18:21.805
Not when I call the police
on their nasty little operation.

18:21.806 --> 18:24.044
Er, speak to Dad first, please.

18:24.045 --> 18:28.045
Both your names are on that place,
I'm scared you might get in trouble.

18:28.285 --> 18:30.684
Look at that, they're here too.

18:30.685 --> 18:32.844
You used to love the gays.

18:32.845 --> 18:36.845
Going home. Getting one of my heads.

18:37.525 --> 18:41.525
Er, go easier on her, yeah?

18:42.765 --> 18:46.765
..found his body under a pub
somewhere in Leicestershire.

18:47.325 --> 18:49.923
Eh, Karen, thanks
for helping us out today.

18:49.924 --> 18:51.565
Couldn't twist your arm
tomorrow, could I?

18:51.566 --> 18:52.604
Yeah...

18:52.605 --> 18:55.685
I mean, I figured that you'd want
to go and see Kassi tomorrow.

18:55.686 --> 18:59.204
Oh, no, he's probably glad
of a few days' peace.

18:59.205 --> 19:02.803
I know I would be! Raising three
kids, you take it where you get it.

19:02.804 --> 19:03.803
Am I right, Frank?

19:03.804 --> 19:05.645
Preaching to the choir, sister!

19:09.445 --> 19:11.124
All right, Jamie?

19:11.125 --> 19:13.563
Y'know, we were having a chat
the other night, me and Kas,

19:13.564 --> 19:16.805
about what you'd change
in your life, if you could.

19:16.806 --> 19:20.805
He said he'd change nothing.
Said his life was perfect.

19:21.525 --> 19:24.204
He said that? "Perfect"?

19:24.205 --> 19:27.844
So... what? This was all
he wanted was it?

19:27.845 --> 19:28.885
"Pull on the brakes,

19:28.886 --> 19:32.885
"that's good enough, thank you,
let's just stop here"?!

19:33.685 --> 19:37.685
She said I could have another...

19:38.085 --> 19:39.564
There you go, Frank.

19:39.565 --> 19:42.525
A fresh one, y'know

19:55.325 --> 19:56.564
Boyfriend?

19:56.565 --> 20:00.565
Business acquaintance.
I prefer my men a bit more...

20:01.805 --> 20:05.204
Well, yeah, something like that.

20:05.205 --> 20:09.205
Aw, don't worry about it, Chesney,
happens to all men, now and again!

20:09.405 --> 20:11.004
Go, do your measuring.

20:11.005 --> 20:15.004
Oh, I'm only messing
about, you clot.

20:15.005 --> 20:16.644
I'll fetch the contract.

20:16.645 --> 20:18.404
Whoa, contract?

20:18.405 --> 20:22.405
Yeah, drew one up for us.

20:26.965 --> 20:30.965
Look, Remona...

20:35.525 --> 20:39.525
Don't use that, you idiot!
Use the screwdriver.

20:49.245 --> 20:51.324
Just there, hon.

20:51.325 --> 20:55.325
I don't have a pen.

20:59.005 --> 21:03.005
Be prepared.

21:05.485 --> 21:07.543
Just there, hon.

21:35.983 --> 21:37.582
Fuck me!

21:37.583 --> 21:39.103
Friend of yours?

21:44.183 --> 21:48.183
I want a refund.
It doesn't work and it tastes funny.

21:51.115 --> 21:52.394
No, but...

21:52.395 --> 21:55.354
I thought that...

21:55.355 --> 21:58.675
So you'll speak to our solicitors
and handle it all?

21:58.676 --> 22:01.194
OK. Love you too. Bye!

22:01.195 --> 22:03.795
What you doing?
I wanted to say hello.

22:03.796 --> 22:05.674
Sorry. Signal dropped.

22:05.675 --> 22:08.554
Was that before or after you said
bye?

22:08.555 --> 22:12.555
After. But, anyway, Bernard's going
to take care of everything,

22:12.635 --> 22:16.073
so all we have to do is put the
whole stupid thing out of our minds.

22:16.074 --> 22:19.033
Oh, so he's going to sort it?
Get rid of them all?

22:19.034 --> 22:20.993
Does that mean
I can get a job there now?

22:20.994 --> 22:24.035
What do you want to
work in a car wash for?!

22:24.036 --> 22:27.714
Have a bit of pride in yourself
for once.

22:27.715 --> 22:29.793
"Our own house, one we actually
own,

22:29.794 --> 22:32.595
"preferably a long way from this
arse end cesspit!" No offence.

22:32.596 --> 22:34.794
None taken.

22:34.795 --> 22:36.754
Come in!

22:36.755 --> 22:39.075
Oh, you're just in time!
You'll like this.

22:39.076 --> 22:40.594
I've made a list!

22:40.595 --> 22:41.594
I helped!

22:41.595 --> 22:43.673
Frank helped. Things I want, for me
and Kass.

22:43.674 --> 22:46.233
He says we're perfect?
He's forgotten, that's all.

22:46.234 --> 22:48.315
There's so much more perfect
we still need to be.

22:48.316 --> 22:51.234
Read out number six.
I did number six.

22:51.235 --> 22:53.355
I didn't write that one down, Frank.

22:53.356 --> 22:54.454
Oh.

22:54.510 --> 22:56.908
I'm going to see Kassi.
I thought you might want a lift.

22:56.909 --> 22:58.308
Going to finish my list first.

22:58.309 --> 23:00.988
Oh, Karen! Don't worry about helping
us box that baklava,

23:00.989 --> 23:02.268
going to do it tonight now.

23:02.269 --> 23:04.948
He needs a brief.
Have you spoken to anyone?

23:04.949 --> 23:07.388
Given any thought to doing
anything to help?

23:07.389 --> 23:09.230
Kassi always deals with
that sort of stuff.

23:09.231 --> 23:13.149
Kass can't sort it!
He's in a fucking police cell!

23:13.150 --> 23:14.508
I know where he is, Jamie.

23:14.509 --> 23:16.748
- You've got a funny way of showing it.
- All right, Jamie...

23:16.749 --> 23:18.628
No, it's not all right! If it was me
in there

23:18.629 --> 23:21.270
would you be sat round the
house baking fucking cakes?!

23:21.271 --> 23:24.669
Baklava.

23:24.670 --> 23:25.830
I just don't get you.

23:25.831 --> 23:27.989
No. You don't.

23:27.990 --> 23:31.430
Because if you did, you wouldn't
come marching in here trying to

23:31.431 --> 23:35.430
tell me how I'm supposed to
act over my husband.

23:40.950 --> 23:44.430
He's just worried, Esther.

23:49.710 --> 23:53.349
Why didn't you put down number six?
It was good.

23:53.350 --> 23:56.189
Cub scouts? With gas masks?

23:56.190 --> 23:58.269
Gas masks, chemistry sets

23:58.270 --> 24:00.828
and a great big fucking seating
plan of a commercial jet!

24:00.829 --> 24:04.228
And there was this bloke
she was with, should have seen him.

24:04.229 --> 24:07.788
You couldn't look more terrorist
if you tried. Beard, the works.

24:07.789 --> 24:09.350
Do you know what you sound like?!

24:09.351 --> 24:12.989
Yeah, I do. I was ten when the 9/11
happened,

24:12.990 --> 24:16.150
and I still remember the way people
looked at my dad the day after,

24:16.151 --> 24:19.389
like it was suddenly "us" and
"them".

24:19.390 --> 24:21.949
And now I sound like a "them".

24:21.950 --> 24:25.950
But that doesn't necessarily
make it bollocks.

24:26.190 --> 24:28.109
I've got to go over later.

24:28.110 --> 24:31.350
Come with us, see for yourself,
tell me if I'm being a dick.

24:31.351 --> 24:34.829
Why me?

24:34.830 --> 24:37.589
Cos you're, like...

24:37.590 --> 24:41.590
the only sort of intelligent person
I know.

24:42.510 --> 24:43.948
Yeah, all right, then.

24:43.949 --> 24:47.590
Quite fancy seeing what sort of woman
can get you to sign over half your
shop

24:47.591 --> 24:50.189
by fluttering her eyelashes.

24:50.190 --> 24:54.190
I do not fancy her. It's just
this thing she does

24:55.750 --> 24:56.950
with her mouth.

24:58.550 --> 25:02.229
No, no, no! It's not like that!

25:02.230 --> 25:06.230
OK!

25:10.830 --> 25:13.309
I'm not getting out of this one.

25:13.310 --> 25:14.309
Mate...

25:14.310 --> 25:16.669
All out of karma.

25:16.670 --> 25:17.709
Fuck!

25:17.710 --> 25:21.589
No, no. None of that matters.

25:21.590 --> 25:23.389
She matters.

25:23.390 --> 25:25.829
She'll tell me that she'll be OK,

25:25.830 --> 25:27.949
and I'll say I don't doubt it.

25:27.950 --> 25:31.950
What else can you say?

25:31.990 --> 25:35.990
But we'll both know we're lying.

25:38.990 --> 25:42.990
Jamie, promise me you'll take care
of her.

25:47.670 --> 25:49.270
I need a word with your mum.

25:49.271 --> 25:50.269
Not here.

25:50.270 --> 25:52.509
I'll come back, then.

25:52.510 --> 25:54.909
Actually, Tam...

25:54.910 --> 25:56.590
Do you mind if I come in for five
minutes?

25:56.591 --> 26:00.590
No.

26:08.070 --> 26:11.749
Bernard knew, didn't he?
He lets them use the place.

26:11.750 --> 26:14.070
That's where all the money
comes from.

26:14.071 --> 26:15.069
What?!

26:15.070 --> 26:17.590
Oh, come off it, it's not that big a
deal.

26:17.591 --> 26:21.590
Makes sense, actually.
You did always love your gays!

26:21.910 --> 26:23.189
I did not!

26:23.190 --> 26:26.908
What about your clique
back in the day? Those three lads?

26:26.909 --> 26:28.788
Used to follow you everywhere?

26:28.789 --> 26:29.830
They weren't gay.

26:29.831 --> 26:32.549
People called you The Pink
Ladies!

26:32.550 --> 26:34.790
Two of them wore more mascara
than...

26:34.791 --> 26:38.790
You can't always tell, OK?!
Can't always tell.

27:04.030 --> 27:06.149
You said he were working.

27:06.150 --> 27:07.869
Upstairs.

27:07.870 --> 27:09.749
Why didn't you tell us?

27:09.750 --> 27:13.750
Up. Stairs.

27:19.870 --> 27:20.988
They needed to know.

27:20.989 --> 27:22.428
Who the hell do you think you are?!

27:22.429 --> 27:23.028
Their uncle.

27:23.029 --> 27:24.510
You don't know them, or me.

27:24.511 --> 27:27.509
You don't even know Kassi!

27:27.510 --> 27:31.510
I made him a promise. I'm going to
be there for you and them.

27:32.870 --> 27:36.069
And what if we don't want you there,
Jamie?

27:36.070 --> 27:37.570
Well, then I guess we have a
problem.

27:37.571 --> 27:41.570
Yeah, I guess we do.

27:46.750 --> 27:50.268
You needn't have stopped by.
I've got most of it down.

27:50.269 --> 27:54.270
Figured we could just move it all
tomorrow. I'm just shutting up.

27:55.750 --> 27:58.829
Oh, either of you want a brew or
anything?

27:58.830 --> 28:00.149
No, thanks.

28:00.150 --> 28:03.590
Tell your woman she's allowed to
speak for herself,

28:03.591 --> 28:07.590
we're very anti-oppression
round here.

28:12.390 --> 28:15.829
See? She talks like that all the
time.

28:15.830 --> 28:17.829
With her mouth?

28:17.830 --> 28:19.828
She's not doing that thing today!

28:19.829 --> 28:21.468
I mean, "anti-oppression".

28:21.469 --> 28:23.670
It sounds kind of terroristy,
don't it?

28:23.671 --> 28:24.710
Don't it?

28:33.150 --> 28:36.429
No, no, no! It was all here!

28:36.430 --> 28:40.430
There was beakers, wires and there
was a picture of a plane right
there.

28:41.310 --> 28:45.310
If it makes you feel any better I'm
pretty certain she's not a terrorist.

28:45.350 --> 28:46.908
Well, what's this, then?

28:46.909 --> 28:50.910
That's a flight number, right?
MDD407? What else could it be?

29:07.430 --> 29:08.995
- Sorry!
- Idiot!

29:13.870 --> 29:15.629
What?

29:15.630 --> 29:18.389
I don't...

29:18.390 --> 29:21.509
What is it?

29:21.510 --> 29:24.550
I saw this programme once,
it was about how people make

29:24.551 --> 29:27.429
explosives out of household bits
and...

29:27.430 --> 29:31.430
Well, it was literally
everything in this box.

29:43.430 --> 29:47.109
What?

29:47.110 --> 29:51.110
We were talking, me and
Kassi, about having another kid.

29:52.030 --> 29:55.229
It's what we both wanted, what I
wanted.

29:55.230 --> 29:57.909
You're his brother...

29:57.910 --> 30:00.588
Don't worry, no actual penetration
required.

30:00.589 --> 30:04.590
Just lend us one of your wank rags
to wring out, I'll do the rest.

30:08.710 --> 30:12.710
It's a joke, Jamie. You deserved
that.

30:13.470 --> 30:15.109
They're moving him.

30:15.110 --> 30:16.270
I'm too late to visit.

30:16.271 --> 30:20.270
You reckon you can sort anything,
don't you?

30:20.990 --> 30:22.390
Yeah, I'll handle it.

30:22.391 --> 30:26.390
Good.

30:26.590 --> 30:30.590
And we'll talk about the jizz
donation another time, yeah?

30:33.430 --> 30:35.549
Right. Now.

30:35.550 --> 30:37.429
All right, Mary-Lou?

30:37.430 --> 30:38.949
Er, Mary Mae.

30:38.950 --> 30:42.229
Really? Are you sure? You look like
a Mary-Lou.

30:42.230 --> 30:44.508
Chesney? Tuck your shirt in,
you're on duty.

30:44.509 --> 30:48.228
Right, I want all the bottles from
that shelf putting on the shelf
above,

30:48.229 --> 30:49.270
I want that shelf clear.

30:49.271 --> 30:53.270
Have you done that
freezer like I told you?

30:56.990 --> 30:58.989
So it is a flight number?

30:58.990 --> 31:00.908
Do you think we're just
being stupid?

31:00.909 --> 31:02.108
I don't know, do I?

31:02.109 --> 31:04.628
You see, this is the problem.
What am I supposed to do,

31:04.629 --> 31:08.228
ring up MI5 and say, "She's a Muslim
and she's got hair lacquer"?!

31:08.229 --> 31:12.188
You need to talk to her.
Get her going about Muslim stuff.
Fundamentalism.

31:12.189 --> 31:15.188
And what? Hope she says,
"Allahu Akbar, death to the West!"?

31:15.189 --> 31:16.744
- Don't be stupid!
- Mary Mae!

31:18.230 --> 31:22.230
Sorry to grab you like this. I
wouldn't normally but I'm worried.

31:23.550 --> 31:25.228
It's about your mum and dad...

31:25.229 --> 31:28.310
Auntie Avril, it's fine. I do know
they're not together any more.

31:28.311 --> 31:30.280
- You do?!
- Sure. We all do, don't we?

31:30.870 --> 31:33.789
Mmm. Why don't they just get
divorced?

31:33.790 --> 31:36.508
It would mean Mum having to give
a reason. The reason.

31:36.509 --> 31:40.190
I honestly think it would kill her
if she thought people knew the truth.

31:40.191 --> 31:41.469
Particularly me.

31:41.470 --> 31:44.949
Especially you.

31:44.950 --> 31:47.349
I know.

31:47.350 --> 31:51.350
Oh, Mary Mae?

31:51.430 --> 31:53.589
Your dad's gay, right?

31:53.590 --> 31:55.469
Oh, yeah!

31:55.470 --> 31:59.470
Thanks.

32:02.190 --> 32:03.189
Right, go on.

32:03.190 --> 32:04.269
What?

32:04.270 --> 32:08.270
Go on!

32:11.310 --> 32:12.709
Er...

32:12.710 --> 32:16.710
So, Remona, if you hadn't come to
work for me, what were you planning
on doing?

32:16.830 --> 32:18.828
Well, I was thinking of travelling.

32:18.829 --> 32:21.510
I still might, once we've got this
place all up and running.

32:21.511 --> 32:23.589
Where? The homeland?

32:23.590 --> 32:26.549
The what?! I'm not a fucking druid!

32:26.550 --> 32:28.469
Oi!

32:28.470 --> 32:32.068
What is up with you? You've been in
a right weird mood all day!

32:32.069 --> 32:36.070
I don't know. Middle East, North
Africa, Morocco. Do me bit.

32:38.270 --> 32:42.270
Your bit? For the Caliphate?

32:42.750 --> 32:46.750
Ooh! The Caliphate, eh?
You read the Koran, then, do you?

32:46.790 --> 32:50.790
I had you figured more as the
"waiting for the DVD" type.

32:51.070 --> 32:52.909
Flicked through it.

32:52.910 --> 32:55.948
Never down with the whole spiritual
Islam stuff, though.

32:55.949 --> 32:59.510
Takes more than aggressive
pamphleting to get people
onside, don't it?

32:59.511 --> 33:01.349
Dunno.

33:01.350 --> 33:05.350
Depends how aggressively
you pamphlet, I suppose.

33:07.990 --> 33:10.509
Well? Was that fundamentally?

33:10.510 --> 33:12.909
Don't really know. Don't you?

33:12.910 --> 33:15.588
That flight's in three hours,
right? So as long as she's here...

33:15.589 --> 33:18.550
Right, we're off. We'll finish up
tomorrow.

33:18.551 --> 33:20.189
Where you going?

33:20.190 --> 33:21.869
Scout stuff.

33:21.870 --> 33:23.109
What Scout stuff?

33:23.110 --> 33:25.710
Well, if we told you that,
we'd have to kill you!

33:27.110 --> 33:28.670
Come on, boys!

33:35.556 --> 33:38.876
What you doing?
You said we were going shopping.

33:38.967 --> 33:41.325
Bernard's done nothing.

33:41.326 --> 33:43.045
So you're going to.

33:43.046 --> 33:46.005
March in there like
Mary fucking Portas

33:46.006 --> 33:50.006
and lay down the law,
just like you said.

33:50.126 --> 33:54.126
All right. I will, then.

33:55.526 --> 33:57.485
Did you hear me?

33:57.486 --> 34:01.486
Please. Let's just go home.

34:03.526 --> 34:05.845
OK.

34:05.846 --> 34:08.425
What are you doing here,
Mrs St Rose?

34:08.435 --> 34:12.074
Nothing. We're going.
Let's go, Avril.

34:12.074 --> 34:14.072
Well, I know you've spoke to him,

34:14.074 --> 34:15.672
so we both know where we stand

34:15.674 --> 34:18.915
and as far as you're concerned,
this place carries on as normal.

34:18.916 --> 34:21.714
Normal?! Some nerve
using that word...

34:21.715 --> 34:25.715
Oh. Homophobia now?
Cos you do know who I am?

34:26.155 --> 34:28.434
How this place got started?

34:28.435 --> 34:31.554
How me and your Bernard used to...

34:42.275 --> 34:46.275
I'm so sorry, Patreesha.

34:58.075 --> 35:00.714
Right. You listen to me.

35:00.715 --> 35:03.954
Firstly, yeah,
I know exactly who you are.

35:03.955 --> 35:07.193
Secondly, I am not homophobic,
I just hate you.

35:07.194 --> 35:10.073
And thirdly, I think
we both know that no matter

35:10.074 --> 35:11.433
who signs your cheques,

35:11.434 --> 35:15.395
this whole enterprise will end the
second I sell my half of the lease.

35:15.396 --> 35:17.314
Which I'm not going to do.

35:17.315 --> 35:20.835
Because I've just decided I suddenly
like this business after all.

35:20.836 --> 35:24.835
Especially the having your
balls in the drawer part.

35:25.355 --> 35:26.754
What do you want?

35:26.755 --> 35:30.755
"What do you want... boss?"

35:36.795 --> 35:38.274
You can head off.

35:38.275 --> 35:40.275
I'm going to introduce myself
to my new staff.

35:40.276 --> 35:41.634
Sorry?

35:41.635 --> 35:45.635
You heard him, Avril.
How this whole thing got started.

35:45.755 --> 35:48.393
How him and Bernard took these
poor boys from the streets

35:48.394 --> 35:50.393
and offered them
a fresh chance at life.

35:50.394 --> 35:52.435
Think it's about time
I did my bit too.

35:52.436 --> 35:56.435
You know me, always been
about taking care of others.

35:58.075 --> 36:02.075
Yeah. That's you all over.

36:23.155 --> 36:26.233
This has gone too far.
What are we going to do,

36:26.234 --> 36:29.113
sit and watch her load explosives
into the back of that van?

36:29.114 --> 36:30.593
Follow her to the airport?

36:30.594 --> 36:31.735
I'm going to talk to her.

36:31.817 --> 36:33.455
Chesney! No, you can't!

36:33.456 --> 36:34.734
She might listen to me.

36:34.735 --> 36:36.696
Or she might strap you
up in a suicide vest

36:36.697 --> 36:40.696
and hand you your flight tickets.

36:47.536 --> 36:51.536
I need to talk to her.

37:08.256 --> 37:12.256
Boys. As you were.

37:12.696 --> 37:13.935
How did you know?

37:13.936 --> 37:17.896
I saw it all - the chemistry kit,
the blueprint of the plane.

37:17.897 --> 37:20.015
MDD407?

37:20.016 --> 37:21.254
Adam's flight to Ibiza?

37:21.255 --> 37:22.936
Who's Adam? The guy with the beard?

37:22.937 --> 37:24.455
What beard?

37:24.456 --> 37:28.456
Adam's the owner, I told you that.
He's opening a bar in Ibi...

37:28.496 --> 37:30.455
Oh, hang on.

37:30.456 --> 37:34.456
Are you trying to say
I'm a fucking terrorist?!

37:34.856 --> 37:36.135
Aren't you?

37:36.136 --> 37:37.815
Er, no, Chesney.

37:37.816 --> 37:39.894
I'm a pharmaceutical technician.

37:39.895 --> 37:41.854
And if you saw chemistry sets,

37:41.855 --> 37:45.216
it's because I'm teaching
this lot how to make soap.

37:45.217 --> 37:48.895
We try to fit it in
between model plane making

37:48.896 --> 37:50.975
and planning mass genocide.

37:50.976 --> 37:53.616
And I thought you would've
had more sense, Mary-Lou.

37:53.617 --> 37:55.495
Mary Mae.

37:55.496 --> 37:57.094
What are you doing then?

37:57.095 --> 37:59.896
What does it look like?
I'm burning down the shop.

37:59.897 --> 38:01.175
Burning? Why?

38:01.176 --> 38:04.335
Because I spent 15 years
of my life here,

38:04.336 --> 38:07.495
and just like that
he's making me unemployed

38:07.496 --> 38:10.656
and homeless without so much
as even breaking into a sweat.

38:10.657 --> 38:12.055
Homeless?

38:12.056 --> 38:14.654
Yeah, homeless.
I did live here, you know?

38:14.655 --> 38:16.374
Not that it meant anything to him.

38:16.375 --> 38:19.016
So I'm burning this place
to the ground,

38:19.017 --> 38:23.016
I'm keeping your money
and nobody will be any the wiser.

38:24.696 --> 38:27.376
Well, seeing as you're here,
you might as well give me a hand.

38:27.377 --> 38:31.376
There's a couple more
jerry cans out the back.

38:38.296 --> 38:40.735
Come in.

38:40.736 --> 38:44.736
What's up?

38:50.296 --> 38:54.296
We'll give you some privacy.

39:02.496 --> 39:04.255
Where are you?

39:04.256 --> 39:06.855
South. Nice view of the Riviera.

39:06.856 --> 39:10.856
Scenic. You always did like
the coast. Seven-hour drive.

39:12.816 --> 39:15.535
Five hours on the train.

39:15.536 --> 39:19.536
Have to bring the kids. Nights
in a B&amp;B, half our life here,

39:19.656 --> 39:21.055
half our life there,

39:21.056 --> 39:22.935
whilst we wait for you.

39:22.936 --> 39:25.456
That's how it's going
to be now, isn't it?

39:25.457 --> 39:27.095
Perhaps.

39:27.096 --> 39:30.415
No "perhaps" about it, Kas.

39:30.416 --> 39:32.415
How could we not?

39:32.416 --> 39:36.416
After all, we had
the perfect life, didn't we?

39:36.736 --> 39:40.736
That's got to be worth
waiting for, hasn't it?

39:41.256 --> 39:44.496
We weren't perfect.

39:49.456 --> 39:52.015
No?

39:52.016 --> 39:54.096
You talk in your sleep, you know?

39:54.097 --> 39:56.535
Always the same thing.

39:56.536 --> 40:00.455
"I want big cock."

40:00.456 --> 40:03.614
At first, because of that stupid
accent of yours, I thought you

40:03.615 --> 40:06.176
were talking about yourself,
until you started adding,

40:06.177 --> 40:08.055
"In my mouth."

40:08.056 --> 40:09.375
Oh?

40:09.376 --> 40:12.216
But, you know, you should try not
to think about it too much.

40:12.217 --> 40:14.575
You're an emotional eater, Esther.

40:14.576 --> 40:16.456
Probably glad to be in there -
all those men.

40:16.457 --> 40:18.415
I can't wait.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.654
I don't want you horsing down pies,

40:20.655 --> 40:22.896
jealous of all the action
I'm seeing in here.

40:22.897 --> 40:24.295
How kind.

40:24.296 --> 40:26.936
Not entirely.
I'm being a little selfish.

40:26.937 --> 40:30.936
You know, your visits, you,
bigger and bigger each time.

40:31.616 --> 40:34.174
I won't be able to get it up
in my cell at night.

40:34.175 --> 40:38.176
Visions of your lardy buttocks
and thighs filling my head.

40:40.256 --> 40:44.255
Perhaps it's better
I don't come at all, then?

40:44.256 --> 40:48.256
Perhaps it is.

40:48.776 --> 40:52.135
I will be OK, you know?

40:52.136 --> 40:56.136
I don't doubt it.

41:01.376 --> 41:05.376
Thanks, Jamie. Nice to get
that out of my system.

41:11.576 --> 41:13.374
You must take care of her, Jamie.

41:13.375 --> 41:15.216
She doesn't want taking care of,
you heard her, she's off her...

41:15.217 --> 41:19.216
You promised.

41:20.976 --> 41:24.976
Thank you.

41:35.976 --> 41:37.774
So who's the bloke with the beard?

41:37.775 --> 41:40.694
He's a hairdresser.
Been saving a few bits for him.

41:40.695 --> 41:42.416
Him? He was a hairdresser?

41:42.417 --> 41:44.415
He's very good.

41:44.416 --> 41:47.295
You could do with a trim yourself.

41:47.296 --> 41:49.856
I'm not getting my hair cut.

41:54.176 --> 41:57.055
Right. I say you show me
my new local,

41:57.056 --> 41:59.014
and then we shift my cases
up to your flat.

41:59.015 --> 42:00.254
What you on about? My flat?

42:00.255 --> 42:01.734
Guys, we really need to get going.

42:01.735 --> 42:03.214
Where else am I going to live?

42:03.215 --> 42:05.814
We've just burned my place down,
in case you haven't noticed.

42:05.815 --> 42:08.056
Anyway, it was all in the contract.
You signed it.

42:08.057 --> 42:12.056
Chesney, now!

42:14.496 --> 42:18.414
White wine spritzer, and one
for yourself, love. I'm celebrating.

42:18.415 --> 42:19.816
Why, have you won the lottery?

42:19.817 --> 42:22.455
No. They've gone back up.

42:22.456 --> 42:24.295
Oh, God.

42:24.296 --> 42:26.815
Eh, Charlton, you got a fag, mate?

42:26.816 --> 42:30.655
Ta.

42:30.656 --> 42:32.335
You OK?

42:32.336 --> 42:34.815
I'll survive. It's what I do.

42:34.816 --> 42:37.935
When he makes a promise,
he sticks to it,

42:37.936 --> 42:40.214
whether the rest of us
like it or not.

42:40.215 --> 42:43.176
He does mean well. Even if
he does seem a bit...

42:43.177 --> 42:44.855
Neanderthal.

42:44.856 --> 42:48.856
Emotionally awkward.

42:49.496 --> 42:53.496
I guess nobody's perfect, are they?

42:58.056 --> 42:59.856
And how are you tonight, Frank?

42:59.857 --> 43:02.255
Bit dry.

43:02.256 --> 43:04.935
Last time.

43:04.936 --> 43:07.335
Yeah, course.

43:07.336 --> 43:11.336
It's definitely mine.
Go on. See you in a minute.

43:12.896 --> 43:15.975
So, the pink ladies ride again?

43:15.976 --> 43:18.654
Yeah, they're nice lads
when you get to know them.

43:18.655 --> 43:21.216
Thought I'd bring them down here.
They don't get out much.

43:21.217 --> 43:24.215
You know, if my
husband had lied to me -

43:24.216 --> 43:27.136
about the business, I mean -
I'd have left him there and then.

43:27.137 --> 43:29.775
Seems like a good reason.

43:29.776 --> 43:31.614
Well, I'm not you, am I, Avril?

43:31.615 --> 43:34.496
Which is probably why
I'm still happily married.

43:34.497 --> 43:38.496
Four pina coladas, please.

43:38.576 --> 43:41.136
You're actually OK about this,
aren't you?

43:41.137 --> 43:44.135
More than OK,
you almost seem happy.

43:44.136 --> 43:46.574
What if I am?
She's all right, isn't she?

43:46.575 --> 43:49.454
I've been in that flat
on me own for ages now.

43:49.455 --> 43:52.334
Plus, you heard her,
she reckons she's a good cook.

43:52.335 --> 43:55.096
And she keeps things tidy,
you saw that chemist.

43:55.097 --> 43:58.775
You want a wifey, don't you?
Cooking and cleaning.

43:58.776 --> 44:01.696
Trust me, I'm not
thinking of her as a wife.

44:01.697 --> 44:05.295
Oi! Mind out, knobhead.

44:05.296 --> 44:07.336
Fuck me! They've cloned Yvonne!

44:07.337 --> 44:08.815
Who's Yvonne?

44:08.816 --> 44:11.215
His mum.

44:11.216 --> 44:13.095
Total mentalist.

44:13.096 --> 44:17.096
Fucking mouth on her.

44:20.016 --> 44:24.016
Chesney, tuck your shirt in.

44:24.176 --> 44:26.815
'Oh, I dunno.

44:26.816 --> 44:29.295
'Maybe I got this whole game wrong.

44:29.296 --> 44:31.056
'Maybe lowering your expectations

44:31.057 --> 44:33.855
'isn't such a bad
thing after all.

44:33.856 --> 44:35.375
'Cos if you don't...'

44:35.376 --> 44:37.934
Pencil mark, have you done
your pencil mark?

44:37.935 --> 44:40.094
'..you might actually
start to believe

44:40.095 --> 44:41.694
'you've got everything you want.

44:41.695 --> 44:44.376
'And that's how you miss out
on the really good stuff.'

44:44.377 --> 44:48.135
Come on, do you want your
slave labour badges or not?

44:48.136 --> 44:50.294
'Like finding that certain someone

44:50.295 --> 44:52.334
'who suddenly makes you
rethink it all,

44:52.335 --> 44:54.574
'changes your priorities,
makes you grow,

44:54.575 --> 44:56.856
'gives you a whole new set
of expectations

44:56.857 --> 45:00.856
'to start all over again with.'

45:10.376 --> 45:11.975
'And trust me,

45:11.976 --> 45:13.496
'that beats being an action hero

45:13.497 --> 45:17.496
'any day of the week.'

45:17.736 --> 45:18.854
Call an ambulance.

45:18.855 --> 45:20.614
He wanted to die. He did it himself.

45:20.615 --> 45:23.054
'Young Aidan's found himself
in a spot of trouble.'

45:23.055 --> 45:25.494
Pretty much the only thing
standing between him and jail.

45:25.495 --> 45:27.054
Bad enough we have to live here,

45:27.055 --> 45:29.654
but I'm not sharing
my space with that... parasite.

45:29.655 --> 45:31.854
I don't want you hanging
round my house, Frank!

45:31.855 --> 45:33.016
Well, your mum does.

45:33.017 --> 45:34.055
I'm in the way.

45:34.056 --> 45:36.174
'From now on,
just the four of us.'

45:36.175 --> 45:38.094
What about the flash trainers?
Driving around in Stan's car.

45:38.095 --> 45:39.174
You think he killed him?

45:39.175 --> 45:41.656
This is Stanton's cash card.
What you doing with that?

45:41.657 --> 45:43.136
It wasn't fucking me!
