00:03.836 --> 00:06.904
After ten electrifying years...

00:06.905 --> 00:08.739
You dish it,
but you can't take it?

00:08.740 --> 00:09.841
How dare you?

00:09.842 --> 00:11.042
<i>Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:11.043 --> 00:12.643
Let's go step outside, bitch.

00:12.644 --> 00:14.112
You better get out of my face.

00:14.113 --> 00:15.813
Is breaking...

00:15.814 --> 00:17.915
All the rules.

00:17.916 --> 00:19.550
This year, I'm gonna
do something different.

00:19.551 --> 00:20.551
<i>Oh, my gosh!</i>

00:20.552 --> 00:21.886
<i>I've never done this before.</i>

00:21.887 --> 00:22.987
<i>For the first time...</i>

00:22.988 --> 00:24.422
Oh, my God.

00:26.058 --> 00:27.992
<i>This is Hell's Kitchen history.</i>

00:27.993 --> 00:30.061
In a shocking season...

00:30.062 --> 00:31.596
Rarh!

00:31.597 --> 00:33.331
That has the aspiring chefs

00:33.332 --> 00:35.032
running for their lives.

00:37.903 --> 00:39.704
Fighting for their lives...

00:39.705 --> 00:41.005
You step up real hard!

00:41.006 --> 00:42.006
What?

00:42.007 --> 00:43.107
Just press the bell, bitch.

00:44.209 --> 00:47.411
And risking their lives...

00:47.412 --> 00:49.413
Oh, my God.
Ugh.

00:49.414 --> 00:50.414
Oh!

00:50.415 --> 00:52.049
Are you okay?

00:52.050 --> 00:54.986
Medic! Medic! Medic!

00:54.987 --> 00:56.687
Do you know
where you are right now?

00:56.688 --> 00:58.723
This group of chefs...

00:58.724 --> 01:00.691
Hurry up, you dimwits!

01:00.692 --> 01:01.759
You're stupid!

01:01.760 --> 01:03.161
Is the funniest...

01:03.162 --> 01:04.295
Hey, dumber and dumber...

01:04.296 --> 01:05.296
Yes, chef?

01:05.297 --> 01:06.330
Foulest...

01:06.331 --> 01:07.331
Shut the up!

01:07.332 --> 01:08.666
I'm not shutting
the up!

01:08.667 --> 01:10.301
You're a bitch!
Do something about it!

01:10.302 --> 01:11.736
You wanna fight?
you.

01:11.737 --> 01:12.770
No, you.

01:12.771 --> 01:14.272
Most fashion forward...

01:14.273 --> 01:15.306
Hey, Barret,
the hair looks beautiful.

01:15.307 --> 01:17.041
Tickets look dreadful.

01:17.042 --> 01:18.442
Let's go, come on.
Sexiest...

01:18.443 --> 01:20.611
You gotta make love
to the meat.

01:20.612 --> 01:22.113
And oddest...

01:22.114 --> 01:24.048
I like the women.
Oh, yes.

01:24.049 --> 01:26.951
<i>Ever to set
foot in Hell's Kitchen.</i>

01:26.952 --> 01:29.453
You're stupid and you smell!

01:29.454 --> 01:31.122
And each of them is sure...

01:31.123 --> 01:34.025
One of you will become
my head chef

01:34.026 --> 01:36.627
That they
will be the chosen one.

01:36.628 --> 01:39.130
<i>At the brand-new
Gordon Ramsay</i>

01:39.131 --> 01:40.898
Pub & Grill...
What?

01:40.899 --> 01:43.067
<i>At the legendary
Caesar's Palace.</i>

01:43.068 --> 01:44.502
That is the dream job.

01:44.503 --> 01:47.238
This is the one thing
I'm actually doing for myself.

01:47.239 --> 01:50.441
I'm ready to rock.
It's on and popping now, bitch.

01:50.442 --> 01:51.943
But to win...

01:51.944 --> 01:53.344
Whoo whoo!

01:53.345 --> 01:55.146
They'll have to survive...

01:55.147 --> 01:56.214
Go, go, go!

01:56.215 --> 01:57.848
The most punishing...

01:57.849 --> 01:59.016
It's not good enough!

01:59.017 --> 02:00.551
<i>We should be two minutes
to window now!</i>

02:00.552 --> 02:01.652
Yes or no?

02:01.653 --> 02:02.653
<i>Hell's Kitchen...</i>

02:02.654 --> 02:03.955
<i>Go!
Move out the way!</i>

02:03.956 --> 02:05.590
Where is it?
Behind you.

02:05.591 --> 02:07.491
What is that?
It's raw!

02:07.492 --> 02:09.160
Ever.

02:09.161 --> 02:10.627
I'm done!

02:10.628 --> 02:13.898
<i>You, you, you, you, you, you,</i>

02:13.899 --> 02:15.299
you, you,

02:15.300 --> 02:17.201
<i>you, you, you, you.</i>

02:17.202 --> 02:18.736
Kiss my ass!

02:18.737 --> 02:20.171
Get the out of here!

02:20.172 --> 02:21.772
Argh!

02:21.773 --> 02:24.642
<i>They don't call it
Hell's Kitchen for no reason.</i>

02:27.980 --> 02:29.313
Argh!

02:29.314 --> 02:31.716
I promise you,
you don't wanna be here.

02:31.717 --> 02:33.284
You don't wanna be here.

02:37.990 --> 02:41.592
<i>And now, the newest
crop of Hell's Kitchen hopefuls</i>

02:41.593 --> 02:44.528
arrives in Los Angeles,
anxious to compete.

02:44.529 --> 02:46.163
Cooking is everything to me.

02:46.164 --> 02:47.632
This is what I was born to do.

02:47.633 --> 02:50.134
Being chosen to be here,
I still gotta

02:50.135 --> 02:53.704
pinch myself to make sure
I'm not dreaming.

02:53.705 --> 02:56.207
I may not have 10,
15 years of experience,

02:56.208 --> 02:59.043
but I don't do mediocre
and I don't do failure.

02:59.044 --> 03:02.546
Winning Hell's Kitchen
is absolutely the only option.

03:02.547 --> 03:05.349
I'ma knock the competition
clean out the box.

03:05.350 --> 03:06.817
I'm on the top of my game.

03:06.818 --> 03:09.086
I look around the corner,
and guess what I see:

03:09.087 --> 03:10.921
<i>The HK bus.</i>

03:10.922 --> 03:12.790
Whoo! To the top!

03:12.791 --> 03:15.326
Here we come, baby.
Whoo! Yes!

03:15.327 --> 03:18.562
Yoo hoo!

03:18.563 --> 03:21.899
I'm looking at the other chefs,
and they're all half my age.

03:21.900 --> 03:23.768
This is old-school
meet new school.

03:23.769 --> 03:24.935
I'm super excited.

03:24.936 --> 03:26.637
<i>I'm ready to get
to Hell's Kitchen.</i>

03:26.638 --> 03:27.938
Let's do it!

03:30.542 --> 03:32.009
I'm from Southern California.

03:32.010 --> 03:33.678
When I win,
I'll be living out here too.

03:33.679 --> 03:36.681
I just want to make a good
first impression on chef Ramsay.

03:37.916 --> 03:39.483
Where are we going?

03:39.484 --> 03:40.551
Are we there yet?

03:41.553 --> 03:42.987
<i>Can we go to McDonald's?</i>

03:42.988 --> 03:44.822
<i>I'm super excited
to see Hell's Kitchen.</i>

03:44.823 --> 03:46.724
Let's go.

03:46.725 --> 03:49.760
Get me to a kitchen
as fast as possible.

03:54.333 --> 03:56.634
<i>Are we going
to Hell's Kitchen yet</i>

03:56.635 --> 03:58.102
<i>on an adventure?</i>

03:58.103 --> 04:00.905
I came out to L.A. to cook,
not ride in circles on a bus.

04:00.906 --> 04:02.206
What the 's going on?

04:02.207 --> 04:03.541
<i>Where are we going?
Where the hell we going?</i>

04:03.542 --> 04:05.276
Where are we going?

04:05.277 --> 04:06.777
It's like a kidnapping here.

04:08.613 --> 04:10.815
There's chef Ramsay.

04:10.816 --> 04:12.216
Shh.

04:12.217 --> 04:13.784
<i>Welcome to Los Angeles.</i>

04:13.785 --> 04:15.619

04:15.620 --> 04:18.022
a very long journey
to get to L.A.

04:18.023 --> 04:23.994
But this is not
your final destination.

04:23.995 --> 04:26.364
Uh...Wait. What?

04:26.365 --> 04:29.967
I want you to come to me
right now.

04:29.968 --> 04:31.168
And I'm in...

04:31.169 --> 04:32.536
Las Vegas.

04:38.243 --> 04:39.944
Jump off that bus.

04:39.945 --> 04:42.680
Your plane is leaving
in ten minutes.

04:44.316 --> 04:45.349

This crazy bitch Gina.

06:43.668 --> 06:46.971
I am ready to throw her ass
off the side of the bus.

06:46.972 --> 06:49.006
There's Ramsay
in the helicopter!

06:49.007 --> 06:50.674
<i>I can see him!</i>

06:50.675 --> 06:52.343
No way.
Hi, I'm Gina.

06:52.344 --> 06:54.278
I am full-blooded Sicilian.

06:58.583 --> 07:00.784
I am gonna knock 'em down.

I mean, it's gonna be bad.

<i>and not many people

09:04.976 --> 09:06.210
I come from Mexico.

09:06.211 --> 09:07.945
If I make it past immigration,

09:07.946 --> 09:10.080
I think I can make it
past chef Ramsay.

09:10.081 --> 09:11.582
Oh, dear.

09:11.583 --> 09:14.218
They may be the
most confident chefs ever.

10:41.506 --> 10:43.273
Yeah! Whoo!

10:43.274 --> 10:44.675
<i>Now...</i>

10:44.676 --> 10:47.044
I have a big announcement.

10:47.045 --> 10:48.846
For the first time ever

10:48.847 --> 10:51.014
<i>in the history
of Hell's Kitchen,</i>

10:51.015 --> 10:53.817
<i>the signature dish challenge
will happen</i>

10:53.818 --> 10:55.719
in front of a live audience.

10:58.923 --> 11:00.257
<i>The competition</i>

11:00.258 --> 11:01.925
to become my head chef

11:01.926 --> 11:03.927
begins right now.

11:03.928 --> 11:05.896
Oh, .

11:16.822 --> 11:19.590
Chef Ramsay has
flown 20 aspiring chefs

11:19.591 --> 11:21.459
to Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas

11:21.460 --> 11:23.261
to make one huge
announcement...

11:23.262 --> 11:26.164
One of you will become
my head chef

11:26.165 --> 11:28.566
<i>at the brand-new</i>

11:28.567 --> 11:30.368
Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill.

11:30.369 --> 11:32.136
After another.

11:32.137 --> 11:33.471
For the first time ever

11:33.472 --> 11:36.040
<i>in the history
of Hell's Kitchen,</i>

11:36.041 --> 11:38.009
the signature dish challenge

11:38.010 --> 11:40.778
will happen in front
of a live audience.

11:44.149 --> 11:47.151
<i>All of you have got 45 minutes</i>

11:47.152 --> 11:48.252
<i>to come up
with something stunning</i>

11:48.253 --> 11:50.488
that really represents you
on a plate.

11:50.489 --> 11:52.357
Don't screw up.

11:52.358 --> 11:54.258
<i>And, as
they say in Vegas,</i>

11:54.259 --> 11:55.893
good luck.

11:57.229 --> 11:58.262
<i>Let's go!</i>

12:04.370 --> 12:06.104
I wasn't expecting to be
cooking today.

12:06.105 --> 12:08.840
I'm wearing a dress and a nice
pair of wedgies.

12:08.841 --> 12:10.141
Oh, hell no.

12:10.142 --> 12:12.643
<i>Get it done, get it done.
Right here, buddy.</i>

12:12.644 --> 12:14.245
<i>Yo, where's
the food processor at?</i>

12:14.246 --> 12:15.413
Behind you.

12:15.414 --> 12:16.948
I hope the food is as good
as the energy.

12:16.949 --> 12:17.949
<i>Let's go.</i>

12:17.950 --> 12:19.150
Once again, chef Ramsay

12:19.151 --> 12:21.185
has divided the teams
into men and women.

12:21.186 --> 12:22.820
Does anybody need an egg wash?

12:22.821 --> 12:23.921
<i>I'll take that.</i>

12:23.922 --> 12:25.289
<i>There you go.
You got a buyer.</i>

12:25.290 --> 12:26.457
I'm from Queens.

12:26.458 --> 12:28.659
I run a kitchen
very efficiently.

12:28.660 --> 12:31.229
But never in an environment
anything like this.

12:31.230 --> 12:32.697
I'm trying not to burn people.

12:32.698 --> 12:34.632
I'm trying not to get burned
by people.

12:34.633 --> 12:36.934
30 minutes to go.

12:36.935 --> 12:39.103
God.

12:39.104 --> 12:41.139
Right behind, coming through.

12:41.140 --> 12:43.174
I'm from L.A.
My signature dish

12:43.175 --> 12:45.443
will be a stuffed steak.

12:45.444 --> 12:47.979
I love meat, cheese, and onion.

12:47.980 --> 12:49.714
Why not put 'em together?

12:49.715 --> 12:50.915
<i>Five minutes!</i>

12:50.916 --> 12:53.418
Let's go.

12:53.419 --> 12:55.753
I'm just wrapping up my dish.

12:55.754 --> 12:58.689
My lamb ain't cooked yet.
I don't got no garnishes ready.

12:58.690 --> 13:00.892
All I know
is I'm running out of time.

13:00.893 --> 13:02.693
Two minutes to go!

13:04.229 --> 13:05.563
Let's go, come on.

13:05.564 --> 13:07.265
Right behind you.
Coming down.

13:07.266 --> 13:09.033
<i>Move, move.
Let's go, let's go!</i>

13:09.034 --> 13:10.168
<i>Let's go there, guys.
Come on, guys.</i>

13:10.169 --> 13:12.070
<i>Five...Four...</i>

13:12.071 --> 13:13.337
Three...

13:13.338 --> 13:15.840
<i>Two...One, and stop!</i>

13:15.841 --> 13:17.775
With their dishes complete,

13:17.776 --> 13:20.144
it's now time for the chefs
to face chef Ramsay...

13:20.145 --> 13:21.446
Ladies and gentlemen,
you ready?

13:21.447 --> 13:22.647
<i>I am.</i>

13:22.648 --> 13:25.850
And an
audience of 2,500 people.

13:25.851 --> 13:27.085
Okay...

13:27.086 --> 13:28.653
<i>Let's start.</i>

13:28.654 --> 13:30.221
First up,

13:30.222 --> 13:32.590
it's executive chef
Danielle from Atlanta...

13:32.591 --> 13:34.358
Thank you.
And head chef Barret

13:34.359 --> 13:35.560
from Long Island.

13:35.561 --> 13:36.828
Before I start tasting,

13:36.829 --> 13:38.963
could you just turn around
for me, please?

13:38.964 --> 13:40.731
Is that "H. K."?

13:40.732 --> 13:42.300
Yes, chef.
Is that a pitchfork?

13:42.301 --> 13:43.568
Yes, chef.

13:43.569 --> 13:45.536
Wow. Wow, wow, wow.

13:48.407 --> 13:49.740
Run through the dish, please.

13:49.741 --> 13:51.309
<i>Uh, it's a pork loin roulade</i>

13:51.310 --> 13:54.278
<i>with fresh spinach,
pine nuts, oyster mushrooms,</i>

13:54.279 --> 13:56.848
and shitake mushrooms...
Yeah.

13:56.849 --> 13:59.550
With a roasted garlic
mashed potato and shallots.

13:59.551 --> 14:02.220
About how much garlic
did you put in there?

14:02.221 --> 14:04.455
Uh, I put quite a bit
of garlic in.

14:04.456 --> 14:06.524
Just have a taste
of the garlic in there.

14:08.961 --> 14:11.395
No wonder your hair's
standing up.

14:17.102 --> 14:19.337
Not a great start.

14:19.338 --> 14:20.471
<i>Danielle,</i>

14:20.472 --> 14:21.706
describe the dish, please.

14:21.707 --> 14:23.975
I made a parmesan-encrusted
chicken breast

14:23.976 --> 14:26.344
with grilled asparagus
and a lemon buerre blanc.

14:26.345 --> 14:28.346
The asparagus looks burnt.

14:36.421 --> 14:37.622
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

14:37.623 --> 14:40.057
Got that color underneath.

14:41.693 --> 14:44.896
And that color on top.

14:44.897 --> 14:47.298
What happens in Vegas
should stay Vegas, right?

14:48.901 --> 14:51.702
And what happened
in that kitchen

14:51.703 --> 14:53.971
quite honestly should have
stayed in that kitchen.

14:53.972 --> 14:55.640
I'm unimpressed.

14:55.641 --> 14:57.141
Zero, zero.

14:57.142 --> 14:59.076
Not a good start.
Let's go.

14:59.077 --> 15:00.745
Get rid of that.

15:02.514 --> 15:04.916
And now, kitchen
manager Nedra from Detroit

15:04.917 --> 15:08.486
and sous chef Sebastian
from Brooklyn.

15:08.487 --> 15:10.655
Somebody get on the ball.
Let's go.

15:11.790 --> 15:13.124
Where are you going?

15:13.125 --> 15:14.559
<i>Where are you going?</i>

15:14.560 --> 15:16.594
I'm trying to avoid, it chef.
I'm trying to avoid it.

15:16.595 --> 15:18.329
I don't wanna...

15:18.330 --> 15:21.098
<i>Okay, Nedra, describe
your dish, please.</i>

15:21.099 --> 15:25.303
Chef, can we pray before
you bust my balls?

15:36.081 --> 15:37.515
Thank you, Nedra.

15:37.516 --> 15:38.816
What did you say in the prayer?

15:38.817 --> 15:43.020
Lord, please don't let chef
bust my balls.

15:44.923 --> 15:46.657
What a beautiful prayer.

15:48.260 --> 15:50.995
Okay, Nedra,
describe your dish, please.

15:50.996 --> 15:53.698
<i>I have
double-grilled potatoes</i>

15:53.699 --> 15:56.701
with a rosemary glaze
on my lamb.

15:56.702 --> 15:58.736
<i>You go girl, whoo!</i>

16:02.074 --> 16:03.608
<i>The good news is...</i>

16:03.609 --> 16:05.109
It's cooked perfectly.

16:07.946 --> 16:10.014
Okay, Sebastian.

16:10.015 --> 16:13.784
These are shrimp
and salmon corn dogs.

16:17.189 --> 16:18.322
Where's the shrimp?
The shrimp's in there.

16:18.323 --> 16:19.690
It's made like a sausage.

16:19.691 --> 16:21.192
Would you taste that, please?

16:21.193 --> 16:22.793
Um, sure, chef.

16:22.794 --> 16:24.395
Say another prayer.

16:26.265 --> 16:27.798
What'd you think?

16:29.067 --> 16:30.735
Yeah.

16:33.939 --> 16:36.407
<i>You got one thing right</i>

16:36.408 --> 16:37.808
before you presented that dish.

16:37.809 --> 16:39.377
You tried to bolt out the back door.
Yes, chef.

16:39.378 --> 16:41.646
I know, that's what
I was thinking.

16:41.647 --> 16:43.581
Congratulations to the girls.

16:43.582 --> 16:45.016
<i>One-nil.
Great start.</i>

16:48.420 --> 16:52.156
I got the first point today
for the girls' team.

16:52.157 --> 16:54.425
Whoo ooh ooh ooh.

16:54.426 --> 16:57.762
Next up, culinary
student Susan from Orange County,

16:57.763 --> 17:01.165
and lead cook Jeremy
from Los Angeles.

17:03.035 --> 17:04.602
Thank you.
Jeremy.

17:04.603 --> 17:07.438
Chef, I prepared
a stuffed steak

17:07.439 --> 17:08.939
with smoked gouda.

17:08.940 --> 17:10.107
<i>And your job is?</i>

17:10.108 --> 17:11.442
I'm a lead cook, chef.

17:11.443 --> 17:12.676
And what is that, a rib eye?

17:12.678 --> 17:14.878
Yes. Well, no,
it's not a rib eye, chef.

17:14.880 --> 17:15.880
What is it?

17:15.881 --> 17:17.515
I think it's a, uh...

17:17.516 --> 17:19.183
<i>I think it's a...</i>

17:19.184 --> 17:20.851
I think it's a rib eye.
I'm sorry, chef.

17:20.852 --> 17:23.354
You think it's rib eye.
It looks like a rib eye.

17:23.355 --> 17:24.521
I believe it is
a rib eye, chef.

17:24.522 --> 17:26.156
So you're a lead cook,

17:26.157 --> 17:28.025
and you haven't got a
clue what you're cooking?

17:30.796 --> 17:32.363
Pretty much, chef.
I'm sorry.

17:32.364 --> 17:36.267
Just asking.
This is your dish.

17:36.268 --> 17:38.803
When you slice into
a steak of that quality,

17:38.804 --> 17:40.604
you destroy the fibers
and the texture,

17:40.605 --> 17:41.772
because you're stuffing it.

17:41.773 --> 17:43.541
I'm sorry chef.

17:43.542 --> 17:45.443
Susan.
Yes, chef.

17:45.444 --> 17:47.812
Now, first off...

17:47.813 --> 17:48.946
Yes, chef?

17:48.947 --> 17:50.181
How many fingers have I got up?

17:50.182 --> 17:51.182
Five.

17:51.183 --> 17:52.350
<i>So you're not blind.</i>

17:52.351 --> 17:54.051
Because I can see from here
that your lamb

17:54.052 --> 17:56.721
is absolutely raw.

17:58.223 --> 17:59.924
This is a serious competition.

17:59.925 --> 18:01.392
<i>It's not even warm.</i>

18:01.393 --> 18:03.027
It's raw.

18:03.028 --> 18:05.196
<i>Are you seriously
trying to kill me?</i>

18:05.197 --> 18:08.299
Do you want
to go home right now?

18:14.383 --> 18:15.650
In the first-ever...

18:15.651 --> 18:16.885
Ladies and gentlemen,
are you ready?

18:16.886 --> 18:18.653
Signature dish challenge

18:18.654 --> 18:20.522
done in front
of a live audience,

18:20.523 --> 18:22.924
the women lead the men
by one point.

18:22.925 --> 18:24.459
<i>That lamb</i>

18:24.460 --> 18:25.694
is absolutely raw.

18:25.695 --> 18:27.662
But with Susan's raw lamb,

18:27.663 --> 18:30.031
the red team could be
losing more than just a point.

18:30.032 --> 18:31.166
You can off now.

18:34.237 --> 18:35.870
And what's this mess here?

18:35.871 --> 18:36.905
It's a couscous

18:36.906 --> 18:38.373
with currants
and toasted pine nuts.

18:38.374 --> 18:40.175
Mm-hmm.
Ptuh!

18:40.176 --> 18:42.711
<i>Sorry.</i>

18:42.712 --> 18:44.679
Couscous is overcooked,

18:44.680 --> 18:45.981
<i>and the lamb's raw.</i>

18:45.982 --> 18:47.649
Yes, chef.
Is this funny for you?

18:51.587 --> 18:54.055
No points.
Disgusting.

18:54.056 --> 18:56.658
Now, executive
chefs Ja'nel from Houston

18:56.659 --> 18:58.727
and Ray from Boston.

19:02.231 --> 19:03.865
<i>This is...</i>

19:03.866 --> 19:06.501
Chef, I have for you
thai grilled prawns

19:06.502 --> 19:09.070
<i>with a spicy Asian Pesto.</i>

19:09.071 --> 19:10.205
Just two of them?
Are we on a budget?

19:13.376 --> 19:14.709
<i>Just asking.
Are we on a diet?</i>

19:14.710 --> 19:15.910
We are not on a diet.
No?

19:15.911 --> 19:18.113
So is it an appetizer
or a entree,

19:18.114 --> 19:19.614
or... where are we
going with this?

19:19.615 --> 19:21.750
Let's go appetizer.

19:21.751 --> 19:23.084
Appetizer.

19:23.085 --> 19:25.120
Smart.

19:27.089 --> 19:28.623
Mmm. Wow, wow, wow.

19:28.624 --> 19:32.027
The sort of sour-sweety
heat that you've got

19:32.028 --> 19:33.361
in that capellini, nailed.

19:33.362 --> 19:35.597
<i>Thank you.
Good job.</i>

19:35.598 --> 19:37.732
<i>Really good job.</i>

19:39.802 --> 19:42.203
<i>Uh, Ray, tough competition.</i>

19:42.204 --> 19:43.738
Uh, right.
How old are you?

19:43.739 --> 19:46.241
51.
You are the oldest chef

19:46.242 --> 19:47.275
<i>we've had on Hell's Kitchen,</i>

19:47.276 --> 19:49.177
<i>let me tell you.</i>

19:49.178 --> 19:50.412
Uh, right.
What is that?

19:50.413 --> 19:51.780
<i>What's in there?</i>

19:51.781 --> 19:53.648
Uh, stuffed veal cutlet
with prosciutto

19:53.649 --> 19:56.551
<i>and gruyere cheese,
topped with a piece</i>

19:56.552 --> 19:58.753
of homemade ricotta.

20:00.323 --> 20:03.158
Wow, Ray.

20:03.159 --> 20:04.726
It's cooked to perfection.

20:09.298 --> 20:10.899
Wow, wow, wow.
Let me tell you something.

20:10.900 --> 20:12.300
The competition has just
gone up a level.

20:12.301 --> 20:13.868
Yeah?

20:13.869 --> 20:15.303
<i>It's a tough one.</i>

20:15.304 --> 20:16.404
<i>It's very tough.</i>

20:16.405 --> 20:19.474
Um...The point...

20:19.475 --> 20:21.309
Goes to both of you.

20:21.310 --> 20:23.011
Well done.
Yeah!

20:23.012 --> 20:24.546
<i>Really well done.</i>

20:24.547 --> 20:26.948
Next, we have
line cook Gina from the Bronx

20:26.949 --> 20:29.984
and head cook Dan
from Westchester, New York.

20:34.724 --> 20:36.791
Dome off, please.
Thank you.

20:36.792 --> 20:37.992
Gina, describe your dish,
please.

20:37.993 --> 20:41.296
It's penne pasta
with homemade meatballs

20:41.297 --> 20:44.599
and a stuffed brigole
with Italian sausage.

20:44.600 --> 20:46.368
Mm-hmm. Wow.

20:46.369 --> 20:49.704
Um, I've got one
very important question.

20:49.705 --> 20:52.374
Did you pick this up
at the buffet?

20:54.076 --> 20:55.977
No?

20:55.978 --> 20:58.213
It's bland.
The penne's undercooked.

20:58.214 --> 20:59.447
<i>I don't get it.</i>

20:59.448 --> 21:03.284
Okay, uh...

21:03.285 --> 21:04.552
Seriously...

21:04.553 --> 21:06.321
<i>Did you throw up on that plate?</i>

21:09.558 --> 21:11.893
Let's go back 45 minutes.

21:11.894 --> 21:13.261
Okay.

21:13.262 --> 21:14.763
What is it supposed to be?

21:14.764 --> 21:16.798
Eggs Benedict with
a champagne hollandaise sauce,

21:16.799 --> 21:18.299
sourdough bread,
heirloom tomatoes,

21:18.300 --> 21:19.434
and sauteed spinach.

21:19.435 --> 21:21.870
And how did you make
the hollandaise?

21:21.871 --> 21:23.037
I used whole butter.

21:23.038 --> 21:24.739
If it's good enough
for Julia Childs,

21:24.740 --> 21:26.674
it's good enough for me.

21:26.675 --> 21:28.410
Julia Childs would be
turning in her grave right now

21:28.411 --> 21:31.279
if she saw that.

21:31.280 --> 21:34.215
It's fitting that
you made this in Vegas,

21:34.216 --> 21:35.817
because whoever eats that

21:35.818 --> 21:38.420
is sure to get the craps,
let me tell you.

21:38.421 --> 21:39.654
<i>That is a joke.</i>

21:39.655 --> 21:41.122
<i>Uh...</i>

21:41.123 --> 21:42.924
Bitter disappointed.

21:42.925 --> 21:44.692
I mean, really disappointed.

21:44.693 --> 21:47.395
Uh, neither of you
deserve a point.

21:47.396 --> 21:50.031
Shocking. And you should
be embarrassed, young man.

21:50.032 --> 21:52.667
With the women
clinging to a one-point lead...

21:52.668 --> 21:54.569
Uh, Amanda.
Ladies first.

21:54.570 --> 21:56.438
Executive chef
Amanda from orange county...

21:56.439 --> 21:57.439
Tasty.

21:57.440 --> 21:58.706
Thank you.

21:58.707 --> 21:59.908
Takes on chef de cuisine jon

21:59.909 --> 22:01.409
from York, Pennsylvania.

22:01.410 --> 22:03.244
You've managed to nail it.

22:03.245 --> 22:04.279
Both of you are gonna
get a point.

22:04.280 --> 22:05.613
Congratulations.
Well done.

22:05.614 --> 22:06.981
And it's a draw.

22:06.982 --> 22:08.583
<i>Finally,
things are looking up.</i>

22:08.584 --> 22:10.418
Next up, head
chef cyndi from queens...

22:10.419 --> 22:11.653
That's delicious.
Than you, chef.

22:11.654 --> 22:13.188
Really delicious.

22:13.189 --> 22:15.089
Faces off against
executive chef Michael

22:15.090 --> 22:16.658
from plains, Pennsylvania.

22:16.659 --> 22:18.092
Finesse, seasoned beautifully.

22:18.093 --> 22:19.794
Both dishes impress.

22:19.795 --> 22:20.895
Tough to decide.

22:20.896 --> 22:23.064
The edge goes to Michael.
Congratulations.

22:23.065 --> 22:24.732
But only Michael gets the point,

22:24.733 --> 22:26.835
leaving the teams tied
at three.

22:26.836 --> 22:28.436
It's not how you start,
it's how you finish, right?

22:28.437 --> 22:29.804
Yes, chef. Let's go.

22:29.805 --> 22:31.172
Next up,

22:31.173 --> 22:33.441
chef tournant Jessica
from New York City

22:33.442 --> 22:38.213
and line chef Anthony
from New Orleans.

22:38.214 --> 22:39.848
Your domes off, please.

22:39.849 --> 22:42.050
<i>Right, uh, ladies first.
What is that?</i>

22:42.051 --> 22:44.185
I made a pan-seared wahoo

22:44.186 --> 22:46.955
with a vegetable succotash
and a lemon-thyme vinaigrette.

22:46.956 --> 22:49.224
And where are you working now?

22:49.225 --> 22:51.626
I work in mid-tent...
midtown Manhattan

22:51.627 --> 22:52.660
at a steakhouse.
Mm-hmm.

22:52.661 --> 22:53.962
So you work at a steakhouse,

22:53.963 --> 22:55.463
<i>and you cook a wahoo for me.</i>

22:55.464 --> 22:56.898
Yes.
Right.

23:01.303 --> 23:02.570
The succotash is delicious.

23:02.571 --> 23:04.138
Uh, wahoo seasoned beautifully.

23:04.139 --> 23:05.473
Um, it's a good dish.

23:05.474 --> 23:07.442
It was lovely.
It's light.

23:07.443 --> 23:08.510
<i>Very nice.</i>

23:08.511 --> 23:10.044
<i>Thank you.</i>

23:10.045 --> 23:12.447
Uh, good.
Things are looking up.

23:12.448 --> 23:14.983
<i>Now, what is that?</i>

23:14.984 --> 23:18.486
That is a new Orleans
barbecue scallop po' boy.

23:18.487 --> 23:21.489
Why would you stick
all that in there just...

23:21.490 --> 23:22.724
Just as a side,
so it wasn't on the plate.

23:22.725 --> 23:23.925
Make it a little neater.

23:23.926 --> 23:25.793
Let me show you something
really difficult.

23:35.804 --> 23:37.939
That was difficult.

23:40.976 --> 23:42.310
Uh, right.

23:47.149 --> 23:50.518
Now, that is
disgusting.

23:53.222 --> 23:55.623
The scallops are a joke.
They're raw.

23:55.624 --> 23:57.525
That is hideous.

23:57.526 --> 23:59.961
And you've just embarrassed
New Orleans cuisine.

23:59.962 --> 24:02.530
Congratulations, ladies.

24:02.531 --> 24:04.065
Good job.

24:07.536 --> 24:09.571
Guys, pull it back.
Let's go.

24:09.572 --> 24:12.173
And now,
Boston line cook Christian

24:12.174 --> 24:16.778
and Mary the butcher
from Belchertown, Massachusetts.

24:16.779 --> 24:18.079
I have for you a...

24:18.080 --> 24:19.147
ah, Jesus.

24:23.052 --> 24:24.352
I have for you...

24:24.353 --> 24:26.688
That's much better.
A pan-seared duck breast.

24:26.689 --> 24:29.424
<i>With, um, a red wine
and orange reduction.</i>

24:29.425 --> 24:30.892
Wow. Uh,
where you cooking?

24:30.893 --> 24:33.161
I'm a butcher at a market
in Amherst, Massachusetts.

24:33.162 --> 24:35.964
And the duck is still
raw in the middle.

24:35.965 --> 24:38.066
<i>You've got that
white line of fat</i>

24:38.067 --> 24:39.200
<i>yes, chef.
Underneath.</i>

24:39.201 --> 24:40.501
<i>And the duck is chewy.</i>

24:40.502 --> 24:42.170
<i>Yes, chef.
So insufficient resting,</i>

24:42.171 --> 24:44.305
but it's not even
cooked properly.

24:44.306 --> 24:45.873
<i>I'm sorry, chef.
Well, congratulations.</i>

24:45.874 --> 24:47.609
You certainly
butchered your dish.

24:50.613 --> 24:52.447
Now, what is that?

24:52.448 --> 24:53.615
It's called pasta ala Norma.

24:53.616 --> 24:55.149
A sauteed eggplant with garlic,

24:55.150 --> 24:57.118
and it's topped with...
basil and shaved

24:57.119 --> 24:58.720
ricotta salata.

24:58.721 --> 25:00.054
And where did you
get the majority

25:00.055 --> 25:01.222
of your line experience?

25:01.223 --> 25:02.724
I bounced around
through mom and pop shops

25:02.725 --> 25:03.791
<i>in the north end of Boston.</i>

25:03.792 --> 25:05.560
Mm-hmm.
I mean, it looks a mess,

25:05.561 --> 25:07.595
but it's got flavor,

25:07.596 --> 25:10.131
and you've got heart
and passion in there.

25:10.132 --> 25:11.699
Thank you, chef.

25:11.700 --> 25:13.434
One to the men.
Congratulations, well done.

25:13.435 --> 25:14.569
Thank you.
Good.

25:16.071 --> 25:18.406
Uh, four to four.
Final pairing.

25:18.407 --> 25:19.540
Ladies and gentlemen,
you ready?

25:21.610 --> 25:22.910
Ladies and gentlemen,

25:22.911 --> 25:24.379
it's the final round,

25:24.380 --> 25:25.780
and we have a tie.

25:25.781 --> 25:28.616
Now, headline cook Zach
from Philadelphia

25:28.617 --> 25:31.619
will face roundsman Jacqueline
from Florence, New Jersey.

25:31.620 --> 25:33.655
Let's go.

25:33.656 --> 25:35.957
Uh...Right.

25:35.958 --> 25:38.192
Big boy.
What is that?

25:38.193 --> 25:40.928
<i>That's grilled pork chop
with mustard Greens.</i>

25:40.929 --> 25:41.996
And your position is...

25:41.997 --> 25:43.264
Uh, just line cook.

25:43.265 --> 25:45.733
Don't just dish...
"a line cook is a line cook."

25:45.734 --> 25:46.901
I mean, that's where
head chefs are made

25:46.902 --> 25:48.703
on the line, right?
Right. Yes, chef.

25:48.704 --> 25:50.638
I mean...

25:50.639 --> 25:52.740
Combination of the apple,
um, fig.

25:52.741 --> 25:54.208
<i>The dish tastes nice.</i>

25:54.209 --> 25:56.411
Unfortunately,
the protein, yeah,

25:56.412 --> 25:57.478
is slightly dry.

25:57.479 --> 25:58.813
What about the flavor?

25:58.814 --> 26:00.782
I said it tastes nice.

26:00.783 --> 26:02.116
Thank you, chef.

26:02.117 --> 26:03.918
<i>Thank you, chef.</i>

26:03.919 --> 26:06.688
The question for me is...

26:06.689 --> 26:08.256
Is Jacqueline's better?

26:08.257 --> 26:11.826
'Cause it all comes down
to this.

26:11.827 --> 26:13.695
Okay, I have a roasted
magret duck breast

26:13.696 --> 26:17.465
with a sweet potato roasty
and caramelized brussels sprouts

26:17.466 --> 26:19.033
<i>with a currant au jus.</i>

26:19.034 --> 26:22.403
Seasoned beautifully.
Presented nice.

26:22.404 --> 26:23.871
This is really close.

26:23.872 --> 26:25.640
Both dishes have got
great execution,

26:25.641 --> 26:27.241
presentation, beautiful.

26:27.242 --> 26:28.309
Yes, thank you.

26:28.310 --> 26:30.111
Both holding finesse.

26:30.112 --> 26:32.814
We definitely finished
better than we started.

26:32.815 --> 26:38.720
But this is really tough,
I'm telling you.

26:38.721 --> 26:40.655
Your dishes are gonna decide

26:40.656 --> 26:42.724
who's gonna win

26:42.725 --> 26:44.559
<i>the first challenge.
Whew.</i>

26:44.560 --> 26:48.496
This is hard.

26:48.497 --> 26:50.832
Duck could have done with

26:50.833 --> 26:53.134
<i>two minutes more.</i>

26:53.135 --> 26:55.369
And the pork chop
could have done with

26:55.370 --> 26:58.840
<i>two minutes less.</i>

26:58.841 --> 27:01.309
Oh, dear. Um...

27:01.310 --> 27:04.912
<i>The winning team...</i>

27:08.550 --> 27:09.917
Congratulations...

27:15.456 --> 27:16.556
With the score tied

27:16.557 --> 27:18.424
in the first-ever
signature dish challenge

27:18.425 --> 27:20.059
done in front
of a live audience...

27:20.060 --> 27:21.094
<i>Right.</i>

27:21.095 --> 27:22.295
<i>Final pairing.</i>

27:22.296 --> 27:23.930
It all comes down

27:23.931 --> 27:25.998
to the last two dishes.

27:25.999 --> 27:27.367
This is really close.

27:27.368 --> 27:29.369
Both dishes have got
great execution.

27:29.370 --> 27:31.437
Presentation beautiful.

27:31.438 --> 27:32.905
But this is really tough,
I'm telling you.

27:36.744 --> 27:40.913
Oh, dear, um...

27:40.914 --> 27:44.016
The winning team...

27:44.017 --> 27:47.286
Congratulations...

27:47.287 --> 27:48.921
Ladies, great job.
Yes!

28:04.905 --> 28:06.339
Wow.

28:07.474 --> 28:09.876
Just like in Vegas,

28:09.877 --> 28:12.345
<i>Hell's Kitchen has
its winners and losers.</i>

28:12.346 --> 28:14.213
And when you win

28:14.214 --> 28:15.348
<i>in Hell's Kitchen,
let me tell you,</i>

28:15.349 --> 28:17.350
you win big.

28:17.351 --> 28:19.252
<i>Ladies...</i>

28:19.253 --> 28:22.021
Tonight, you are gonna become

28:22.022 --> 28:24.257
V.I.P. guests in Vegas,

28:24.258 --> 28:26.526
starting right now.

28:30.664 --> 28:34.066
You are in for a night
full of surprises

28:34.067 --> 28:35.668
<i>at Caesar's Palace.</i>

28:35.669 --> 28:37.270
Ohh, yeah!

28:40.340 --> 28:42.742
<i>Men, while the ladies
are gonna be treated</i>

28:42.743 --> 28:44.343
like V.I.P.s,

28:44.344 --> 28:47.480
<i>your evening is gonna be
anything but luxury,</i>

28:47.481 --> 28:48.481
<i>let me tell you.</i>

28:48.482 --> 28:50.183
You will not be flying back

28:50.184 --> 28:51.918
<i>to Hell's Kitchen</i>

28:51.919 --> 28:55.221
<i>or driving in a luxury limo.</i>

28:55.222 --> 28:59.258
You're going back in this.

29:08.068 --> 29:09.569
This school bus will take you

29:09.570 --> 29:12.472
on a long drive through
Death Valley.

29:15.976 --> 29:17.710
<i>I've been assured</i>

29:17.711 --> 29:20.913
that the last time
they checked...

29:20.914 --> 29:22.949
It should make it.

29:24.651 --> 29:25.985
<i>One more thing...</i>

29:25.986 --> 29:27.353
there seems to be a problem,

29:27.354 --> 29:29.422
but they haven't
got it right yet,

29:29.423 --> 29:31.057
with the air conditioning.

29:33.760 --> 29:35.328
No...

29:35.329 --> 29:36.696
<i>Uh, gentlemen, your school bus</i>

29:36.697 --> 29:37.964
will be leaving right now.

29:51.645 --> 29:54.847
I feel like a dumbass,
and I'm not looking forward

29:54.848 --> 29:57.383
to an 8 1/2-hour
school bus ride.

29:57.384 --> 29:59.752
That's an oven on wheels
that may or may not

29:59.753 --> 30:01.587
get us all the way
back to L.A.

30:01.588 --> 30:02.822
Yay.

30:02.823 --> 30:04.323
Hot in here, man.

30:04.324 --> 30:06.459
<i>Road trip, yeah!</i>

30:06.460 --> 30:08.060
<i>If anybody sings
Wheels on the Bus,</i>

30:08.061 --> 30:10.229
I will lose my mind.

30:13.233 --> 30:17.570
*

30:17.571 --> 30:20.573
Welcome, congratulations,
red team.

30:23.110 --> 30:24.243
<i>Look at that.</i>

30:24.244 --> 30:25.478
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

30:25.479 --> 30:26.946
Oh...My God.

30:26.947 --> 30:28.114
It was gorgeous.

30:28.115 --> 30:29.782
It was the biggest suite
I've ever been in.

30:29.783 --> 30:31.284
Check this place out.

30:31.285 --> 30:34.587
I've never been to Vegas,
and it is so cool here.

30:34.588 --> 30:36.355
Even the air smelled good,
like they must

30:36.356 --> 30:39.725
manufacture
delicious-smelling air.

30:39.726 --> 30:41.894
There's Sushi on our table!

30:41.895 --> 30:43.729
<i>There is a Sushi woman!</i>

30:43.730 --> 30:45.565
Oh, my God!

30:45.566 --> 30:48.034
I see this woman
laying on the table

30:48.035 --> 30:50.269
with Sushi all over her body.

30:50.270 --> 30:53.506
This is absolutely nothing that
I could ever have dreamed of.

30:53.507 --> 30:55.207
To the bus!

30:55.208 --> 30:56.275
To the bus!

30:56.276 --> 30:58.244
Oh, man, I'm sorry, guys.

30:58.245 --> 31:00.880
While the women
drink to victory, the men...

31:00.881 --> 31:01.981
<i>Super hot out here.</i>

31:01.982 --> 31:04.417
<i>Welcome to hell, bitch.</i>

31:04.418 --> 31:05.751
Drink to survive.

31:05.752 --> 31:07.653
<i>Man, it's hot!</i>

31:07.654 --> 31:10.289
You know it's hot
when you consider

31:10.290 --> 31:12.458
saving your own sweat
and then drinking it.

31:12.459 --> 31:14.460
This cannot happen again.

31:14.461 --> 31:17.296
Just listen, before we
try to go all Rambo,

31:17.297 --> 31:19.231
"I know what the
I'm doing,"

31:19.232 --> 31:21.300
listen for a second there,
and then we can get it done.

31:21.301 --> 31:22.768
Don't worry about
what happened today.

31:22.769 --> 31:24.937
What happened today
is irrelevant.

31:24.938 --> 31:26.706
<i>Tomorrow is gonna be key, dude.</i>

31:26.707 --> 31:31.010
You'd think that the hot seats,
the temperature,

31:31.011 --> 31:32.712
you'd think those would be
the worst things

31:32.713 --> 31:34.647
about this, right?

31:34.648 --> 31:36.449
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

31:36.450 --> 31:38.451
Then there's Sebastian.

31:38.452 --> 31:41.253
Gordon's expectations of us
are gonna be like .

31:41.254 --> 31:43.856
So we really gotta focus
on trying to make our paper,

31:43.857 --> 31:45.358
do what we know how to do...
It's not important,

31:45.359 --> 31:47.259
a reason to give a ...
And it's just like

31:47.260 --> 31:48.861
no more egos, let's just do

31:48.862 --> 31:50.129
what we came here to do,
and that's...

31:50.130 --> 31:51.697
We try to go
a little bit far beyond...

31:51.698 --> 31:52.999
We just gotta remember,

31:53.000 --> 31:54.266
it's not that
they don't try to help...

31:54.267 --> 31:56.268
But if one of us gets something
down on one station,

31:56.269 --> 31:59.338
and he... he shows one of us,
like, let's...

31:59.339 --> 32:00.473
One thing we have
to understand, guys,

32:00.474 --> 32:01.907
like if you guys
want to look good,

32:01.908 --> 32:03.142
like, just jump on a station
and you really don't know

32:03.143 --> 32:05.011
what you're doing, don't.

32:05.012 --> 32:06.712
I wanna throw Sebastian
right out the window.

32:06.713 --> 32:08.214
He just talks too much,

32:08.215 --> 32:10.416
just "blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah."

32:10.417 --> 32:12.284
I think one of the reasons
that they really

32:12.285 --> 32:13.819
beat the
out of us today

32:13.820 --> 32:16.589
was the fact that their dishes
were pretty straightforward.

32:16.590 --> 32:18.791
Pretty simple.
Oh, my God!

32:18.792 --> 32:21.293
Sebastian...Time out.

32:21.294 --> 32:23.129
Let's get one thing
straight.

32:23.130 --> 32:26.565
They won by a little...
a little, little bit.

32:26.566 --> 32:29.435
Let's play the quiet game.
See how you do on that one.

32:29.436 --> 32:33.105
<i>It's over. It's over.
We're not doing it.</i>

32:33.106 --> 32:34.774
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:34.775 --> 32:36.575
One, I know
we're not back in L.A.,

32:36.576 --> 32:38.144
'cause I don't see no lights.

32:38.145 --> 32:39.145
<i>We didn't break down, did we?</i>

32:39.146 --> 32:40.846
<i>Think we got a flat.</i>

32:40.847 --> 32:42.014
All of a sudden,
the bus is stopping

32:42.015 --> 32:43.349
in the middle of the freeway.

32:43.350 --> 32:45.618
What is this?
Are you absolutely me?

32:45.619 --> 32:47.119
Uh, hello?

32:47.120 --> 32:49.155
<i>Whoa.</i>

32:49.156 --> 32:51.157
I saw this
in a horror movie once.

32:51.158 --> 32:52.658
<i>Hey, it looks
a little too dark out there</i>

32:52.659 --> 32:53.893
for us to be
going over here right now.

32:53.894 --> 32:55.327
Pitch black outside.

32:55.328 --> 32:57.430
I'm looking for
the Wile E. Coyote to come out

32:57.431 --> 32:58.597
and attack.

32:58.598 --> 33:00.633
What the going on?

33:00.634 --> 33:01.634
Kind of don't want to get off.

33:01.635 --> 33:02.935
<i>Should we get off?</i>

33:02.936 --> 33:04.103
When you spend that much time

33:04.104 --> 33:05.438
with somebody,
going through the desert,

33:05.439 --> 33:08.507
you never know
what's gonna happen.

33:08.508 --> 33:10.743
It is called Death Valley,
and if we come back

33:10.744 --> 33:12.878
with one less person,
I didn't see anything.

33:15.215 --> 33:16.482
What was that?

33:21.926 --> 33:23.860
Having lost the challenge...

33:23.861 --> 33:25.862
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:25.863 --> 33:27.464
The men were
punished with a long,

33:27.465 --> 33:29.967
hot ride through the desert.

33:29.968 --> 33:31.969
It's nothing but sand
and cactus.

33:31.970 --> 33:33.804
<i>And although they're all
eager to get to Hell's Kitchen...</i>

33:33.805 --> 33:35.472
Yeah, let's get off
this bus for a minute.

33:35.473 --> 33:37.474
They welcome
the break from Sebastian

33:37.475 --> 33:38.508
and his constant chatter.

33:38.509 --> 33:40.043
Oh, man.

33:40.044 --> 33:41.912
Losing the challenge
is just not something

33:41.913 --> 33:43.547
that's gonna happen again.

33:43.548 --> 33:45.849
<i>All I'm thinking about is
getting back to Hell's Kitchen</i>

33:45.850 --> 33:47.084
and trying to prove
that we could cook

33:47.085 --> 33:49.720
better than the girls can.

33:49.721 --> 33:52.155
While the men's night
has reached a low point...

33:52.156 --> 33:53.724
Back in Vegas...

33:53.725 --> 33:55.058
Ladies, someone's
here to see you.

33:55.059 --> 33:57.361
The women's evening
is hitting a high note.

33:57.362 --> 33:58.829
It's her!

33:58.830 --> 34:00.430
Oh, my God, Celine Dion!

34:08.005 --> 34:09.773
They got us tickets
to the concert.

34:09.774 --> 34:11.274
I'm like, "Okay."

34:11.275 --> 34:12.376
Tickets, tickets.

34:12.377 --> 34:14.210
How do you top this?

34:18.783 --> 34:20.317
Celine Dion in person?

34:20.318 --> 34:21.885
I can't even believe
this is happening to me.

34:21.886 --> 34:23.387
So good to meet you.

34:23.388 --> 34:25.522
Hi. How are you?

34:25.523 --> 34:26.556
Oh, give me a hug!

34:28.326 --> 34:31.194
Who gets to stand in front
of Celine Dion

34:31.195 --> 34:33.830
and grab her and hug her?

34:33.831 --> 34:35.899
Hi. How you doing,
guys?

34:35.900 --> 34:36.933
Congratulations.

34:36.934 --> 34:38.402
<i>You look pretty.</i>

34:38.402 --> 34:40.871
That's amazing.
Way to go, girls, right?

34:40.871 --> 34:42.039
Oh, my gosh,
I touched her hand.

34:42.040 --> 34:45.409
I-I almost melted.
She was just like gold.

34:45.409 --> 34:47.077
Like, I didn't even want
to touch her

34:47.078 --> 34:48.911
she looked so beautiful.

34:48.913 --> 34:50.547
All right, ladies.
Big smiles.

34:50.547 --> 34:51.882
Hold it right there.

34:51.882 --> 34:53.216
Ladies...

34:55.085 --> 34:58.255
I cannot believe
we met Celine Dion.

34:58.256 --> 35:01.925
I cannot wait to watch her
perform tonight.

35:01.926 --> 35:04.061
*

35:07.131 --> 35:08.832
It was a really
overwhelming experience

35:08.833 --> 35:11.668
just to be sitting there
with the events of the day,

35:11.669 --> 35:16.273
soaking in this amazing,
talented singer.

35:18.576 --> 35:20.077
It's an experience
that I'll never forget.

35:20.078 --> 35:23.580
One that I will never, ever,
ever get a chance to have again.

35:23.581 --> 35:25.282
<i>She's so unreal.</i>

35:26.617 --> 35:27.851
After a
thrilling night of fun...

35:27.852 --> 35:28.985
Unreal!

35:28.986 --> 35:30.587
The women depart Las Vegas

35:30.588 --> 35:32.322
seven hours after the men.

35:32.323 --> 35:34.591
<i>Hell's Kitchen,
here we come, baby!</i>

35:34.592 --> 35:36.493
Whoo!

35:36.494 --> 35:39.129
<i>And still arrive
at Hell's Kitchen first.</i>

35:39.130 --> 35:41.231
<i>Welcome to Hell's Kitchen.</i>

35:41.232 --> 35:43.033
Come follow me.
I'll show you your dorms.

35:43.034 --> 35:44.101
Whoa!

35:47.038 --> 35:50.373
It is like so
surreal that I'm here.

35:50.374 --> 35:52.609
I'm ready to go in.
I'm ready to start cooking.

35:52.610 --> 35:54.211
Ohh...

35:54.212 --> 35:55.679
<i>Yeah!</i>

35:55.680 --> 35:56.680
<i>Look at this!</i>

35:56.681 --> 35:58.782
<i>Look at the fire down there.</i>

35:58.783 --> 35:59.983
Wow.
Oh, this is so cool!

35:59.984 --> 36:02.686
This is so cute.

36:02.687 --> 36:03.954
This is really nice.

36:03.955 --> 36:05.522
This is absolutely amazing.

36:05.523 --> 36:07.924
We're close to really getting
down and dirty

36:07.925 --> 36:09.092
in this competition.

36:10.161 --> 36:11.194
<i>Aah!
Oh!</i>

36:11.195 --> 36:12.496
But not tonight.

36:12.497 --> 36:14.364
You all right?

36:14.365 --> 36:15.532
It's okay!

36:15.533 --> 36:17.000
<i>Winners always get up.</i>

36:19.170 --> 36:20.403
<i>Oh, my God.
Yeah, man.</i>

36:20.404 --> 36:21.905
Whew!
Here we go.

36:21.906 --> 36:24.708
Finally! It's late.
I'm tired.

36:24.709 --> 36:26.643
<i>But this is Hell's Kitchen.</i>

36:26.644 --> 36:28.111
This is where I belong.

36:28.112 --> 36:29.312
And I'm ready!

36:29.313 --> 36:30.947
<i>Hi, boys.
Hi, guys.</i>

36:30.948 --> 36:32.782
<i>Have you guys been on
the bus the entire time?</i>

36:32.783 --> 36:33.884
Oh, yeah.

36:33.885 --> 36:34.918
Look at our picture there.

36:34.919 --> 36:36.119
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

36:36.120 --> 36:38.755
With Celine Dion?
Yeah, man.

36:38.756 --> 36:39.756
<i>Holy .</i>

36:39.757 --> 36:42.592
Oh, wow.
So you had enough time

36:42.593 --> 36:46.429
to go party and get
V.I.P. treatment

36:46.430 --> 36:49.766
in the time that I got
to ride a bus to L.A.

36:49.767 --> 36:50.867
It's not fair.

36:50.868 --> 36:52.169
<i>Sorry, guys.</i>

36:52.170 --> 36:53.603
<i>Sorry, boys.</i>

36:53.604 --> 36:54.704
I'm not sorry.

36:54.705 --> 36:56.673
I hope you continue
to keep losin',

36:56.674 --> 36:59.676
because I want to win
every challenge.

36:59.677 --> 37:01.545
This ain't bad at all.

37:01.546 --> 37:04.147
With both teams
finally in Hell's Kitchen...

37:04.148 --> 37:06.116
Tomato relish...

37:06.117 --> 37:07.918
<i>That's like the easiest one.</i>

37:07.919 --> 37:10.487
Everyone is
focusing on studying the menu.

37:10.488 --> 37:13.456
I'm not gonna remember any
of this in the morning anyways.

37:13.457 --> 37:15.225
Except for one chef.

37:15.226 --> 37:17.694
Oh, my God,
are these young girls?

37:17.695 --> 37:20.463
Who's brought
along a very special friend.

37:20.464 --> 37:21.765
* Whatsa matter with you

37:21.766 --> 37:23.967
* it's-a nice-a place

37:23.968 --> 37:28.672
I'm trying to study,
and there's a random chef puppet

37:28.673 --> 37:31.007
having conversations with me
and my other roommates.

37:31.008 --> 37:32.209
I don't know
what to do about it.

37:32.210 --> 37:33.410
<i>Get the hell out of here.</i>

37:33.411 --> 37:36.646
My name is Alfredo Al Dente.

37:36.647 --> 37:39.716
Bitch, who brings a puppet
in Hell's Kitchen?

37:39.717 --> 37:43.420
I like-a the sausage, baby,
over here.

37:43.421 --> 37:47.757
Gordon, what the hell kind of
name is that ?

37:47.758 --> 37:53.997
Tonight, I say you sleep-a
with the one eye open.

37:53.998 --> 37:55.432
<i>Capisce?</i>

37:55.433 --> 37:56.833
We gotta study.

37:56.834 --> 37:59.469
Gina, baby,
they don't understand.

37:59.470 --> 38:03.139
But tomorrow,
they're gonna cry.

38:03.140 --> 38:04.608
Gina, what the
are you doing?

38:04.609 --> 38:07.310
You're acting like
a two-year-old right now.

38:07.311 --> 38:09.312
Hey, Maria,
you got the pasta ready?

38:09.313 --> 38:10.647
Nedra!
Nedra!

38:10.648 --> 38:12.449
Oh, let me see
who she's with?

38:12.450 --> 38:15.118
Come regulate in this room.

38:15.119 --> 38:17.587
Bitch, you better take
you and that puppet

38:17.588 --> 38:18.989
and get the out of here

38:18.990 --> 38:21.524
'fore I kick you
and that puppet's ass.

38:24.762 --> 38:26.129
Oh, .

38:26.130 --> 38:27.931
<i>This is not Sesame Street.</i>

38:27.932 --> 38:29.799
You better watch
your ps and qs,

38:29.800 --> 38:32.302
<i>'cause you don't know me.</i>

38:37.571 --> 38:39.706
After an
exhausting day in Vegas...

38:39.707 --> 38:41.007
<i>Sorry, guys.
Not in this one.</i>

38:41.008 --> 38:43.009
Both teams hit the menu books.

38:43.010 --> 38:44.310
We gotta study.

38:44.311 --> 38:46.212
But Gina and her study buddy...

38:46.213 --> 38:48.581
Hey, Maria,
you got the pasta ready?

38:48.582 --> 38:49.683
Ned!
Back in the old-a country.

38:49.684 --> 38:50.784
Nedra!

38:50.785 --> 38:52.652
Are about to get schooled.

38:52.653 --> 38:54.287
<i>This is not Sesame Street.</i>

38:54.288 --> 38:56.289
You better watch
your ps and qs,

38:56.290 --> 38:57.590
'cause you don't know me.

38:57.591 --> 38:59.659
The first person to go
is definitely

38:59.660 --> 39:01.194
gonna be this crazy bitch Gina.

39:01.195 --> 39:03.063
Get your together,
home girl.

39:03.064 --> 39:05.031
You may be a little...
Cuckoo! Cuckoo!

39:05.032 --> 39:08.568
Listen to me, you guys,
I'm not cuckoo.

39:11.238 --> 39:12.939
I get along with everyone.

39:12.940 --> 39:16.409
I'm the person that makes
everybody laugh all the time.

39:16.410 --> 39:18.812
These girls kind of like
look up to me.

39:18.813 --> 39:22.449
Oh, my God.
They love-a her.

39:22.450 --> 39:24.117
After a long day...

39:24.118 --> 39:25.418
What the ?

39:25.419 --> 39:26.453
I heard that.

39:26.454 --> 39:28.488
This is gonna be
something else.

39:28.489 --> 39:29.889
And a weird night...

39:31.258 --> 39:32.525
All of the chefs are up early

39:32.526 --> 39:34.394
to get ready
for the grand reopening

39:34.395 --> 39:35.528
of Hell's Kitchen.

39:35.529 --> 39:37.731
<i>Come on, ladies!</i>

39:37.732 --> 39:39.966
Well, almost all of them.

39:39.967 --> 39:43.670
It's the first day.
Oh, my God.

39:43.671 --> 39:45.638
Every part of my body
is aching.

39:45.639 --> 39:47.674
My neck, my spine.

39:47.675 --> 39:50.510
I'm not liking how I'm feeling.

39:50.511 --> 39:53.780
Did somebody put something
in my orange juice?

39:54.849 --> 39:56.883
Who's holding us up?
Gina!

39:56.884 --> 39:58.251
<i>Well, where is she?</i>

39:58.252 --> 39:59.786
I'm feeling like an idiot.

39:59.787 --> 40:03.490
But I have to do
what I have to do.

40:03.491 --> 40:05.825
<i>Good, we got Gina.
Come on.</i>

40:05.826 --> 40:08.161
Good, let's go.
Yo, let's go.

40:08.162 --> 40:09.162
Go, red team!

40:09.163 --> 40:10.964
<i>Morning, chefs.
Morning, chef.</i>

40:10.965 --> 40:13.466
Chef Ramsay
has provided both teams

40:13.467 --> 40:14.934
with the very best equipment.

40:14.935 --> 40:17.670
You have these
J.A. Henckels knife kits.

40:21.342 --> 40:23.810
But Gina's lost her edge.

40:23.811 --> 40:27.814
I'm not seeing things
as they are.

40:27.815 --> 40:30.517
I'm just kind of like
my mind's wandering,

40:30.518 --> 40:32.986
and I don't know why
this is happening.

40:32.987 --> 40:35.388
You need to grab those aprons
and put 'em on, okay?

40:35.389 --> 40:36.523
Let's start workin'.

40:36.524 --> 40:38.124
Behind, behind, behind.

40:38.125 --> 40:39.926
With dinner service coming up,
we gotta come out swinging.

40:39.927 --> 40:41.928
'Cause we're not taking another
one to the chin like that.

40:41.929 --> 40:44.197
We ain't leaving it like Vegas.
Ain't gonna leave it like Vegas.

40:44.198 --> 40:45.331
In the blue kitchen...

40:45.332 --> 40:47.300
Man, I'm getting
the hang of this bitch.

40:47.301 --> 40:48.868
The men are
a picture of teamwork.

40:48.869 --> 40:51.004
Raise on pasta!
Raise on pasta!

40:51.005 --> 40:52.138
I've got some half lemons here.

40:52.139 --> 40:53.640
But in the red kitchen...

40:53.641 --> 40:55.475
All right, why can
I not find this?

40:55.476 --> 40:57.210
The women
aren't fully in focus.

40:57.211 --> 40:58.645
All right, sugar, sugar, sugar.

40:58.646 --> 41:01.614
Gina is not focused.

41:01.615 --> 41:02.916
I have no idea what's going on
in her head,

41:02.917 --> 41:05.218
but she needs
to snap out of it.

41:05.219 --> 41:06.686
Risotto.

41:06.687 --> 41:08.755
I'm standing there
and I'm trying to focus,

41:08.756 --> 41:13.660
and I felt like I was just
gonna drop on the floor.

41:13.661 --> 41:14.961
<i>Gina, what's going on?</i>

41:14.962 --> 41:18.932
Um, I'm feeling like
I can't function.

41:18.933 --> 41:20.233
<i>Okay.</i>

41:20.234 --> 41:22.235
Gina has given up already.

41:22.236 --> 41:23.469
<i>You're gonna miss everything.</i>

41:23.470 --> 41:25.238
I'm sorry that
I'm doing this, but...

41:25.239 --> 41:26.573
No, let's go.
Let's go...

41:26.574 --> 41:28.308
I am losing it.

41:28.309 --> 41:29.843
The way I'm feeling,

41:29.844 --> 41:31.211
I can't continue.

41:31.212 --> 41:33.746
I need to speak to a medic.

41:33.747 --> 41:36.416
Medic!

41:36.417 --> 41:39.319
Gina's screwing us
royally right now.

41:39.320 --> 41:40.353
Right now, we're prepping.

41:40.354 --> 41:41.688
This is our kitchen.
We gotta run it.

41:41.689 --> 41:42.822
So what are we doing here?

41:42.823 --> 41:44.257
<i>Are we operating without Gina?</i>

41:44.258 --> 41:45.491
<i>Medic!</i>

41:45.492 --> 41:47.994
<i>Medic!</i>

41:47.995 --> 41:49.562
Gina, like what the
are you doing?

41:49.563 --> 41:50.930
We have so much prep.

41:50.931 --> 41:52.899
You guys need
to get with it,

41:52.900 --> 41:54.200
because we're gonna
have service

41:54.201 --> 41:55.301
really, really soon.

41:55.302 --> 41:56.803
We're totally screwed.

41:56.804 --> 41:59.939
Right, ladies, are we ready?

42:00.941 --> 42:02.375
Can you tell me your name?

42:03.978 --> 42:06.145
Do you know
where you are right now?
