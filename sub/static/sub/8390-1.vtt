A HEART ATTACK?

IT'S GONNA BE GOOD, RIGHT?

01:15.420 --> 01:16.682
I MEAN, YOU SAID
IT WAS GONNA BE GOOD,

01:16.730 --> 01:17.958
AND THAT'S ESSENTIALLY
WHY I'M DOING IT,

01:18.000 --> 01:19.206
BECAUSE YOU SAID
IT WAS GONNA BE GOOD,

01:19.250 --> 01:20.797
SO IF IT ISN'T GOOD, I DON'T
THINK I'LL EVER FORGIVE YOU.

01:20.830 --> 01:24.038

COULD YOU GIVE US A MOMENT?

02:06.710 --> 02:08.678
PERHAPS YOU COULD USE THIS TIME
TO PUT ON A SHIRT.

02:08.710 --> 02:10.359
- NAH, AH, AH.

02:25.280 --> 02:26.133
I'M OUT OF MONEY.

02:26.180 --> 02:28.489

03:23.960 --> 03:25.439
- YEAH, HE DOESN'T WANNA GO.

03:25.480 --> 03:26.788
- WELL, IT'S A BASEBALL GAME.
HE'S GOTTA GO.

03:26.820 --> 03:28.196
- HE DOESN'T WANNA GO
TO THE GAME.

03:28.240 --> 03:29.195
HE'S GONNA GO.
WE'LL GET HIM TO GO.

03:29.240 --> 03:30.684
- WELL YOU'RE THE COACH.

AND GET HIM TO THE GAME.

03:33.210 --> 03:34.757
- AH!

03:47.120 --> 03:48.633
MAX?

03:48.670 --> 03:50.285
MAX.

03:50.330 --> 03:52.298
LISTEN, MAX,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLAY BASEBALL,

03:52.330 --> 03:54.389
NOT AFTER THIS SEASON.

03:54.440 --> 03:56.260
BUT I WANT YOU
TO GIVE THIS A CHANCE,

03:56.300 --> 03:58.359
BECAUSE IT MEANT A LOT TO ME
WHEN I WAS A KID.

03:58.410 --> 04:01.368
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY,
WILL YOU GIVE IT A SHOT?

04:03.170 --> 04:04.546
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,
AFTER THE GAME,

04:04.580 --> 04:07.231
WHY DON'T WE GO HAVE
SOME ICE CREAM?

04:07.280 --> 04:09.066
DOUBLE SCOOP.

04:09.110 --> 04:10.247
AND WHEN I SAY DOUBLE SCOOP,

04:10.280 --> 04:12.202
WHAT I REALLY MEAN
IS TRIPLE SCOOP.

04:12.250 --> 04:13.319
- I THINK
YOU SHOULD LET HIM STAY.

04:13.350 --> 04:15.659
LIKE, DO WE EVEN CARE
ABOUT BASEBALL?

04:15.700 --> 04:17.622
- WELL,
YOUR FATHER SURE DOES.

04:17.670 --> 04:18.807
- WHY?

04:18.840 --> 04:21.320
- WELL, BECAUSE MEN FEEL
THE NEED TO EXPRESS THEIR LOVE

04:21.360 --> 04:24.534
THROUGH HITTING BALLS,
SLAPPING BUTTS,

04:24.570 --> 04:27.152
AND DISCUSSING
MEANINGLESS STATISTICS.

04:27.190 --> 04:28.361
AND I THINK YOUR FATHER
THINKS THAT

04:28.400 --> 04:29.560
IF MAX DOESN'T DO
THESE THINGS,

04:29.610 --> 04:32.408
HE'S GONNA GROW UP
TO BE SAD AND ALONE.

04:32.440 --> 04:36.570
- WELL, THAT'S ABSURD.

04:36.620 --> 04:37.848
- [sighs]

04:37.890 --> 04:39.778
- WE ONLY HAVE 12 MINUTES, GUYS.
COME ON. LET'S GO. LET'S GO.

04:39.830 --> 04:41.969
- OKAY, OKAY. HONEY HOW
DID YOU MAKE THIS HAPPEN?

04:42.000 --> 04:44.560
- OH, I JUST TOLD HIM ABOUT
THE JOYS OF BASEBALL...

04:44.590 --> 04:46.376
AND HOW IT'S SOMETHING HE CAN
DO WITH HIS FATHER FOREVER.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.899
- OH. DOUBLE SCOOP.
- TRIPLE.

04:47.940 --> 04:48.793
- GREAT PARENTING.

04:48.840 --> 04:49.761
- LOOK, ONCE HE
GETS HIS FIRST HIT...

04:49.800 --> 04:51.381
EVERYTHING IS GONNA
TURN AROUND FOR HIM.

04:51.420 --> 04:53.354
THIS IS GONNA BE FUN!
- OKAY.

04:53.390 --> 04:55.119
- WOO! ALRIGHT, LET'S GO!

05:05.200 --> 05:07.339

WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?

05:11.440 --> 05:13.328
DAD'S OUT OF CONTROL.
- BEND THE KNEES A LITTLE MORE.

05:13.380 --> 05:15.371

I GOTTA, I GOTTA--
[clears throat]

05:16.380 --> 05:17.608
I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.

05:17.660 --> 05:18.991
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW?

05:19.040 --> 05:20.314
YOU WITH SOMEONE?

05:20.350 --> 05:21.419

I AM READY TO HAVE A BABY,
AND YOU'RE NOT.

16:36.990 --> 16:38.093
YOU'RE NOT MATURE ENOUGH.

16:38.130 --> 16:39.813
- OKAY,
I'M NOT MATURE ENOUGH.

16:39.860 --> 16:42.260
I'M NOT THE ONE OUT
SCROUNGING UP SOME GUY'S SPERM--

16:42.310 --> 16:43.618
- AND I AM NOT
SCROUNGING IT UP.

16:43.650 --> 16:44.992
I BOUGHT IT, FOR A LOT.

16:45.030 --> 16:46.133
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU,
ACTUALLY,

16:46.170 --> 16:47.899
IT IS AMAZING SPERM.
- IS IT?

16:47.930 --> 16:50.490
- YEAH, THE DONOR IS AN OLYMPIC
ATHLETE AND A RHODES SCHOLAR.

16:50.520 --> 16:53.034
- GREAT, THEN IT SOUNDS LIKE
THIS SPERM'S GONNA BE

16:53.080 --> 16:54.172
AN EXCELLENT FATHER.

16:54.220 --> 16:57.929
SO MAYBE HE CAN COACH
SOCCER FOR YOU OR WHATEVER.

16:57.980 --> 16:58.935
- YOU'RE AN IDIOT.
- I'M AN IDIOT.

16:58.980 --> 17:00.072
- YEAH.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.941
- OKAY, I DON'T HAVE
A SPACE-AGE CONTRAPTION IN MY--

17:02.980 --> 17:04.322
WHEN ARE YOU OVULATING?

17:04.360 --> 17:06.669
- FRIDAY.

17:12.300 --> 17:15.679
[all talking at once]

17:51.860 --> 17:52.952
- HEY, MAXIMO,

17:53.000 --> 17:55.787
SAVE SOME PAPER
FOR THE REST OF US.

18:07.810 --> 18:09.209
FREAK.

18:10.460 --> 18:11.734
- [screams]

18:11.780 --> 18:13.839
- BOYS! BOYS!

18:13.880 --> 18:17.748
MAX. MAX.
MAX, STOP IT!

18:17.780 --> 18:21.329
STOP IT. STOP IT.
STOP IT.

18:21.370 --> 18:23.509
CALM DOWN. STOP IT.

18:23.550 --> 18:24.471
STOP IT!

18:24.510 --> 18:27.570
MAX, CALM DOWN.
- HE BIT ME.

18:27.620 --> 18:30.783
- BACK TO WORK, EVERYONE.
- HE BIT ME!

18:30.830 --> 18:32.752
- MAX. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:32.800 --> 18:35.246
- I JUST, I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT MAX WOULD DO THAT.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.133
- HE MUST HAVE BEEN TAUNTED.

18:36.180 --> 18:38.387
- AND WE WILL DEAL
WITH AMOS AS WELL.

18:38.420 --> 18:39.899
BUT FOR RIGHT NOW,
WE WANT TO FOCUS ON MAX.

18:39.940 --> 18:42.556
- I THINK WE'RE OVERANALYZING
THIS A LITTLE BIT.

18:42.600 --> 18:45.489
MAYBE IF WE DIDN'T ALLOW HIM TO
WEAR A PIRATE COSTUME TO SCHOOL,

18:45.530 --> 18:46.940
HE'D FIT IN
A LITTLE BIT BETTER.

18:46.980 --> 18:48.220
- WAIT A MINUTE,
WAIT A MINUTE,

18:48.260 --> 18:49.841
WE ALL DECIDED THAT WE WOULD
MONITOR THE PIRATE SITUATION.

18:49.880 --> 18:51.256
- EVERYONE ELSE DECIDED,
AND NOW HE'S GETTING PICKED ON,

18:51.300 --> 18:52.392
WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHAT I THOUGHT WOULD HAPPEN.

18:52.440 --> 18:53.429
- I THINK WHAT
WE'RE TRYING TO SAY HERE

18:53.470 --> 18:56.223
IS THAT WE'RE NOT SURE
THAT SULLIVAN ELEMENTARY

18:56.270 --> 18:58.670
IS THE RIGHT FIT FOR MAX.

19:00.340 --> 19:02.615
- I AM--I'M SORRY,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND--

19:02.650 --> 19:04.686
- I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE MAX
TO AN EDUCATIONAL THERAPIST

19:04.720 --> 19:07.280
TO HAVE HIM TESTED
TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT

19:07.310 --> 19:09.198
SHE THINKS MAX
CAN BE SUCCESSFUL--

19:09.250 --> 19:10.239
- LET'S JUST CUT
TO THE CHASE.

19:10.280 --> 19:11.963
ARE WE GETTING EXPELLED?
YOU GIVING US THE BOOT?

19:12.010 --> 19:13.659
- ADAM.

19:16.770 --> 19:18.180
ARE WE?

19:18.220 --> 19:19.494
- THAT'S GREAT.

19:19.530 --> 19:21.521
AMBER'S OUT WITH HADDIE
AND HER FRIENDS.

19:21.570 --> 19:24.289
- OOH, HERE'S A TWO-AND-ONE
IN EMERWILLE.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.433
THAT LOOKS GOOD.

19:25.470 --> 19:28.462
- EMERWILLE?
OVER MY DEAD BODY.

19:28.510 --> 19:29.716
WHY DON'T YOU
PUT THAT THING DOWN?

19:29.750 --> 19:32.639
YOU'RE STAYING RIGHT HERE
UNTIL YOU GET BACK ON YOUR FEET.

19:32.680 --> 19:34.545
- MOM, I'M ON MY FEET.
I'M NOT DESTITUTE.

19:34.580 --> 19:36.719
I JUST GOT
A LITTLE FINANCIAL TROUBLE

19:36.760 --> 19:39.752
AND TWO DEGENERATE KIDS,
BUT I'LL BE FINE.

19:39.790 --> 19:43.442
- I'M JUST LETTING YOU KNOW
WE'RE HERE FOR YOU.

19:43.490 --> 19:46.072
- THANK YOU.
BUT TRUST ME.

19:46.110 --> 19:47.725
I THINK I SHOULD
CUT THIS OUT, YOU KNOW,

19:47.770 --> 19:50.762
IN THE SLIM CHANCE
THAT WE WEAR OUT OUR WELCOME.

20:32.470 --> 20:35.633
[cell phone ringing]

20:38.960 --> 20:40.678
HELLO?

20:40.720 --> 20:42.438
WHO IS THIS?

20:42.480 --> 20:44.857
[96%]
OH, MY GOD.

20:44.890 --> 20:47.859
[plaintive melody]

20:51.210 --> 20:54.202
- CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

20:54.250 --> 20:55.729
- ADAM. HEY.

20:55.770 --> 20:57.283
- HEY. IT'S OKAY.
ALL RIGHT?

20:57.320 --> 20:59.732
THEY WEREN'T OFFICIALLY
BOOKED, SO...

20:59.770 --> 21:01.943
IT'S NOT GONNA GO
ON THEIR RECORDS.

21:04.330 --> 21:05.809
- OH...

21:05.850 --> 21:08.637
THANK GOD FOR THAT, HUH?

21:10.260 --> 21:12.842
OH, GOD.

21:12.890 --> 21:15.120
KRISTINA, I'M SO SORRY.

21:15.170 --> 21:17.923
- OH, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S FINE, IT'S OVER.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.968
- IT'S OVER.

21:49.680 --> 21:51.671
- OKAY.

21:52.340 --> 21:53.921
I'LL MAKE US SOME COFFEE.

21:58.100 --> 21:59.749
- MOM.

22:00.280 --> 22:02.316
IT WASN'T MY WEED.

22:02.760 --> 22:03.931
- THAT'S GREAT.

22:03.970 --> 22:05.619
WHAT A RELIEF.

22:06.350 --> 22:08.523
SO PROUD OF YOU, HONEY.

22:35.140 --> 22:37.347
- OH, DATE NIGHT.

22:37.390 --> 22:40.109
- PLEASE. NO COMMENTS.

22:40.150 --> 22:42.380
- WHERE'S HE TAKING YOU?
- CHINESE.

22:42.430 --> 22:44.386
- SEXY.

22:44.430 --> 22:46.386
- THAT'S ENOUGH OUT OF YOU.
OKAY?

22:46.430 --> 22:47.215
THAT'S ENOUGH.

22:47.260 --> 22:48.875
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
YOU MADE ME MAD,

22:48.910 --> 22:50.229
AND YOU EMBARRASSED ME.

22:50.260 --> 22:51.989
AND IT'S GONNA BE
A LONG TIME BEFORE

22:52.020 --> 22:54.887
YOU EARN MY TRUST BACK.

22:54.920 --> 22:56.672
- OKAY.

23:01.440 --> 23:04.955
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT
THE SHOES?

23:07.930 --> 23:09.033
- GO ON.

23:09.070 --> 23:11.345
- WELL, I MEAN,
IT'S A DATE,

23:11.390 --> 23:12.823
NOT A BAR MITZVAH.

23:12.870 --> 23:14.007
I JUST THINK
YOU SHOULD REALLY

23:14.040 --> 23:15.553
GO WITH YOUR STRONG SUIT,
YOU KNOW?

23:15.600 --> 23:16.794
- WHAT IS MY STRONG SUIT?

23:16.840 --> 23:19.047
- UH, YOUR BOOTS,
OBVIOUSLY.

23:19.080 --> 23:20.001
- ALL RIGHT.

23:20.050 --> 23:21.972
- ALSO, THAT BAG IS--

23:22.020 --> 23:23.976
IT'S VERY 19605,

23:24.500 --> 23:26.468
NOT IN A GOOD WAY.

23:28.160 --> 23:29.468
- OH, GOD.

23:29.510 --> 23:32.638
[reflective music]

23:53.530 --> 23:56.658
[Asian music]

24:07.130 --> 24:09.052
- HI.

24:11.410 --> 24:13.162
- SARAH. HI, IT'S ME.

24:13.210 --> 24:14.780
IT'S, UH--

24:23.040 --> 24:24.211
- OH, GOD, I'M SORRY.

24:24.250 --> 24:26.480
I--I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU--
YOU WERE GOING TO THE RIGHT.

24:26.530 --> 24:28.077
ARE YOU OKAY?
- YES, I'M GOOD.

24:28.120 --> 24:29.599
- YOU LOOK GREAT.

24:29.640 --> 24:32.188
- OH, AND YOU.

24:32.910 --> 24:34.116
WOW.

24:35.260 --> 24:36.875
- YOU WANNA SIT DOWN?
- OKAY.

24:36.920 --> 24:37.887
- YEAH.

24:38.990 --> 24:40.912
- [laughs nervously]

24:40.960 --> 24:43.053
GOSH.

24:43.100 --> 24:45.375

SHE RAN INTO YOU

24:48.480 --> 24:49.583
AT, UM, AT BERKELEY COFFEE.

24:49.620 --> 24:50.996

24:51.040 --> 24:52.587
YOU WORK NEAR THERE?

24:53.940 --> 24:56.033
- OH, MAYBE SHE DIDN'T, UH...

24:57.940 --> 25:00.147
I--I WORK

25:03.640 --> 25:04.766
- YEAH.
SHE DIDN'T SAY THAT.

25:04.810 --> 25:08.701
UM, AND SO HOW LONG HAVE
YOU BEEN IN THE CAFFEINE GAME?

25:08.740 --> 25:12.050
- UH, LOOK, IT'S A LONG STORY,
ACTUALLY, I--

25:12.090 --> 25:14.058

I'M JUST GONNA CUT YOU OFF.

25:14.090 --> 25:16.263
I HAVE TO, UM,
I'M JUST GONNA MAKE A QUICK--

25:17.440 --> 25:18.646
AND THEN, UM,
I'M GONNA BE RIGHT BACK.

25:18.680 --> 25:20.022
- I'LL GET
THE APPETIZERS STARTED.

25:20.070 --> 25:23.062
DO YOU LIKE SHRIMP TOAST?
- ANY KIND OF TOAST.

25:25.830 --> 25:29.209
[cell phone ringing]
- [groans]

25:29.250 --> 25:30.387
HELLO?

25:30.420 --> 25:33.548
- WELL,
IS THIS WHO I AM TO YOU?

25:33.600 --> 25:34.737
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

25:34.770 --> 25:35.862
- I MEAN, I KNOW I'M NOT
A BIG LAWYER

25:35.910 --> 25:38.287
WHO WALKS AROUND ON THE WEEKENDS
IN A JUICY PANTSUIT.

25:38.320 --> 25:40.629
DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO GO OUT
WITH A FAT, BALDING BARISTA?

25:40.670 --> 25:42.149
I'M JUST WONDERING.
IS THAT WHO I AM TO YOU?

25:42.190 --> 25:43.566
- OH, MY GOD. SARAH.

25:43.610 --> 25:45.987
- NO, NO, NO.
DON'T "OH, GOD" ME, JULIA.

25:46.020 --> 25:48.671
I KNOW YOU'RE SEXIER THAN ME.
EVERYBODY KNOWS IT.

25:48.710 --> 25:49.950
- WHOA, WHOA, HOLD ON.

25:49.990 --> 25:51.366
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU HAVE TO ALWAYS

25:51.410 --> 25:52.263
PROVE THAT YOU'RE BETTER
THAN ME.

25:52.300 --> 25:54.188
I AM NEVER LETTING YOU
SET ME UP AGAIN.

25:54.240 --> 25:55.195
EVER.

25:55.240 --> 25:56.548
- GOOD, BECAUSE I'M DONE
TRYING TO HELP YOU.

25:56.580 --> 25:57.820
- WELL,
I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP

25:57.860 --> 25:59.373
BECAUSE I'M NOT
SOME CHARITY CASE.

25:59.410 --> 26:01.992
- SCREW YOU.
- OH, NO, SCREW YOU.

26:02.040 --> 26:04.247
I CAN'T TALK TO YOU RIGHT NOW
ANYWAY, I HAVE TO GO,

26:04.280 --> 26:06.202
BECAUSE I AM ON
A FREAKIN' DATE.

26:08.910 --> 26:11.049
[elevator bell dings]

26:14.360 --> 26:15.395

26:26.030 --> 26:28.191
THAT'S THE, UH,
THAT'S THE RING I GAVE YOU.

26:28.930 --> 26:31.785
- OH, YEAH.
[chuckles]

26:31.830 --> 26:33.058
HOW DO YOU HAVE IT?

26:33.100 --> 26:34.965
- OH, WELL, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU REMEMBER.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.069
YOU SORT OF THREW IT
AT ME

26:36.110 --> 26:38.203
THE NIGHT YOU BROKE UP
WITH ME.

26:38.250 --> 26:39.649
- OH.

26:39.700 --> 26:42.248
[965%]
I HIT YOU RIGHT IN THE EYE.

26:42.290 --> 26:43.245
- YEAH, REMEMBER?

26:43.290 --> 26:44.973
I SAID YOU SHOULD REALLY,
YOU SHOULD--

26:45.010 --> 26:46.659

- RIGHT.

26:46.700 --> 26:49.351
[both laugh]

26:49.400 --> 26:50.389
- [laughs nervously]

26:50.430 --> 26:52.398
- SO I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I'M NOT JUST A BARISTA.

26:52.430 --> 26:54.011
I REBUILD TRUCKS
FROM THE '305.

26:54.060 --> 26:55.880
I HAVE SEVERAL
PING-PONG TROPHIES ON DISPLAY

26:55.920 --> 26:58.366
IN MY OTHERWISE
UNIMPRESSIVE APARTMENT.

26:58.400 --> 27:00.914
AND IF THAT'S NOT ENOUGH,
WHICH I'M SURE IT IS,

I JUST FOUND THE NEW YORKER

THOUGHT ABOUT YOU, SARAH.

27:16.460 --> 27:18.928
- [sniffles]

27:21.290 --> 27:22.598
- ARE YOU--

27:22.640 --> 27:24.665
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT OR...?

27:26.230 --> 27:30.223
- YOU JUST KEPT THIS

27:30.680 --> 27:33.331
THAT'S SO NICE.

27:33.370 --> 27:36.168
YOU'RE SO NICE AND FUNNY.

27:36.200 --> 27:41.069
I MARRIED THIS GUY
WHO'S, YOU KNOW,

27:41.100 --> 27:44.274
LIKE A TORTURED MUSICIAN,
AND HE HAS THIS DRUG PROBLEM.

27:44.310 --> 27:46.938
[sighs]

27:46.970 --> 27:51.930
I WAS SUCH A JERK TO--

27:51.980 --> 27:56.690

27:56.740 --> 28:00.949
I'M JUST, I'M NOT VERY GOOD
AT THE, UM...

28:00.980 --> 28:03.631
THE DATING THING ANYMORE,

28:03.680 --> 28:05.910
AND I MEAN, LET'S FACE IT,
IN MY PRIME,

28:05.960 --> 28:08.986
I WASN'T--I WASN'T
THAT GOOD AT IT EITHER.

28:09.030 --> 28:12.431
- YOU'RE MORE BEAUTIFUL
THAN I REMEMBER YOU.

28:12.480 --> 28:14.402
- SHUT UP.
- YOU ARE.

28:14.450 --> 28:17.135
- SERIOUSLY,
PLEASE SHUT UP.

28:21.250 --> 28:23.343
REALLY?
- YEAH.

28:26.180 --> 28:27.454
IS YOUR DAD HOME?

28:27.490 --> 28:29.071

28:29.120 --> 28:31.281
- IT'S OKAY. WE'RE 38.
- OH.

28:35.540 --> 28:37.292
AH, DAMN. NO CONDOMS.

28:37.330 --> 28:39.742
I'M SORRY. I HAVE JUST
BECOME SO ACCUSTOMED...

28:39.780 --> 28:41.293
TO THE IDEA OF
NOT GETTING LAID.

28:41.340 --> 28:42.887
- [laughs] OH, OH!

28:42.920 --> 28:44.569
IT'S OKAY!
[crashing] OOPSIE!

WHY DOES YOUR DAD HAVE
CONDOMS IN HIS DESK DRAWER?

28:51.170 --> 28:53.616

FOR SCISSORS THE OTHER DAY

28:53.660 --> 28:56.128
AND I FOUND THEM. [squeels]
- OH, MY GOD. WHAT DID YOU DO?

28:56.180 --> 28:58.967

OLYMPIC EVENT, SO...

29:11.500 --> 29:12.364

STANFORD HECHT,

29:14.990 --> 29:17.504

29:17.540 --> 29:18.677
HE NEVER GOT

29:18.720 --> 29:20.267
HE NEVER ROLLED A BALL.

29:20.310 --> 29:21.265
JUST THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE
TO KNOW THAT BEFORE

29:21.310 --> 29:22.618

29:24.970 --> 29:27.063
- YEAH.
I GOOGLED YOUR SPERM.

29:27.110 --> 29:29.271
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS

29:29.310 --> 29:30.891
WITHOUT EVEN DISCUSSING IT
WITH ME.

29:30.940 --> 29:32.032
- WELL, WHAT ARE
WE SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS?

29:32.080 --> 29:34.799
EVERY TIME THE WORD COMMITMENT
COMES UP, YOU WINCE.

29:34.840 --> 29:36.148

29:47.500 --> 29:49.570

A BUNNY?

29:53.480 --> 29:54.549
WHAT'S A COMPROMISE?

29:54.580 --> 29:56.502

31:20.150 --> 31:22.698
POP,

BUT SHE WASN'T JUST
TALKING ABOUT ACADEMICS.

34:30.060 --> 34:31.470

34:53.050 --> 34:54.563
- HE WAS HAVING
A VERY BAD DAY.

34:54.600 --> 34:56.773
AND THOSE TESTS THAT
SHE GAVE TO HIM WERE RIDICULOUS.

34:56.810 --> 34:57.629
- ADAM, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

34:57.680 --> 34:58.772
- SHE DIDN'T CONNECT

THE ACADEMICS, OKAY?

35:15.490 --> 35:16.627
IT'S NOT--

35:16.660 --> 35:20.448
IT'S NOT JUST THE BITING
OR THE PIRATE COSTUME

35:20.490 --> 35:24.256
OR THE FEAR OF FIRE
OR THE--THE TANTRUMS.

35:25.670 --> 35:27.638

I'M REALLY SORRY, ADAM.

37:34.280 --> 37:35.417
IT WAS A BAD CALL.

37:35.460 --> 37:38.668

YEAH, THANKS FOR THAT.

37:38.700 --> 37:40.429
I'M SORRY, I COULDN'T

SO, YOU MAKE THE CALL...

[knocking at door]
OKAY, BYE.

37:50.260 --> 37:51.909
HEY.

37:51.950 --> 37:53.702
- NO, I HAD THIS MEETING
OVER AT SHATTUCK,

37:53.750 --> 37:54.956
AND THEN CROSBY CALLED
FREAKING OUT

37:54.990 --> 37:56.958
ABOUT SOME EMERGENCY
THAT COULDN'T WAIT.

37:56.990 --> 37:59.094
- UH, DREW DIDN'T HAPPEN
TO COME BY, DID HE?

37:59.130 --> 38:00.267
- HERE?
- YEAH.

38:00.310 --> 38:01.163
- NO.

38:01.200 --> 38:02.588
- OH, I GOT A WEIRD CALL
FROM THE SCHOOL.

38:02.620 --> 38:04.099
- YEAH?
- I DON'T KNOW.

38:04.140 --> 38:05.232
I'M JUST TRYING NOT TO PANIC.

38:05.280 --> 38:06.656
I'M SURE IT'S NOTHING,
IT'S JUST--

38:06.690 --> 38:08.373
- ADAM, I AM
IN A REAL PICKLE, MAN.

38:08.420 --> 38:09.819
KATIE ALREADY TRIED
TO MOVE UP THE DATE.

38:09.870 --> 38:11.485
YOU GOTTA GET ME
OUT OF THIS ENGAGEMENT.

38:11.530 --> 38:13.031
- ENGAGEMENT?
- OH, YOU'RE JUDGMENTAL?

38:13.080 --> 38:15.662
- YOU AND KATIE GOT ENGAGED?

38:15.700 --> 38:16.769
- WHOA, WHAT?

38:16.810 --> 38:18.562
- CROSBY AND KATIE
GOT ENGAGED.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.807
- OKAY, THIS IS ABOUT
THE FROZEN-SPERM THING.

38:20.850 --> 38:22.841
- I'M SORRY, THE WHAT?
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

38:22.880 --> 38:25.121
IS THERE NOT ANY CONFIDENTIAL
MALE-GUY STUFF ANYMORE?

38:25.160 --> 38:26.434
- I DON'T THINK SO.

38:26.470 --> 38:28.267
- HI, CRAZY LADY
WHO YELLS AT HER SISTER

38:28.300 --> 38:29.710
FROM A DATE.

38:29.750 --> 38:32.093
- FINE. I MAY HAVE OVERREACT ED
A LITTLE BIT.

38:32.130 --> 38:33.097
- MAYBE?
- WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

38:33.130 --> 38:35.371
- WHY ARE YOU HERE?
WHY IS EVERYONE HERE?

38:35.410 --> 38:37.025
BECAUSE THIS IS ADAM
AND CROSBY TIME.

38:37.070 --> 38:38.162
- I DIDN'T INVITE THEM.

38:38.210 --> 38:39.609
- KRISTINA'S PICKING SYDNEY UP
FROM SCHOOL FOR US.

38:39.660 --> 38:40.991
JOEL HAS A DENTAL THING,

38:41.040 --> 38:43.065
AND SYDNEY DOESN'T LIKE ME
VERY MUCH ANYWAY, SO--

38:43.110 --> 38:44.623
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.
- SHE LOVES YOU.

38:44.660 --> 38:47.379
- OH, SHE OPENLY PREFERS JOEL,
AND THAT IS FINE,

38:47.420 --> 38:49.900
BECAUSE I AM A GOOD LAWYER,
AND HE IS A GOOD FATHER.

38:49.940 --> 38:53.216
SO SHE WILL BE LIKE
A RELATIVE OF MINE.

38:53.260 --> 38:54.659
SEE, I CAN--
I CAN MANAGE THIS.

38:54.710 --> 38:57.156
I CAN LOWER MY EXPECTATIONS.
- HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

38:57.190 --> 38:58.043
HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

38:58.090 --> 38:59.705
WAIT, SO ARE WE SAYING
WE LOST DREW?

38:59.750 --> 39:02.503
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED, OKAY?

39:02.540 --> 39:04.986
IT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THE FACT THAT

39:05.030 --> 39:08.158
HE WALKED IN ON ME AND JIM
HALF-NAKED LAST NIGHT.

39:08.200 --> 39:09.406
- YOU SLEPT WITH JIM?

39:09.450 --> 39:10.576
- GOOD FOR YOU.

39:10.620 --> 39:12.474
- WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM
BEING A FAT, BALDING BARISTA?

39:12.520 --> 39:14.238
- I WARMED TO HIM.

39:14.280 --> 39:15.440
- HOW MANY DAYS
HAS SHE BEEN HOME?

39:15.490 --> 39:17.139
- GET THEM OUT OF HERE.

39:17.180 --> 39:19.557
- HELLO. HI, SETH.

39:19.590 --> 39:20.796
- SETH, THERE'S A WINNER.

39:20.840 --> 39:21.761

39:21.800 --> 39:23.142
- SHE WAS SCREAMING AT ME
ON THE PHONE.

39:23.180 --> 39:24.556
- WHAT?
HE'S WITH YOU?

39:24.600 --> 39:27.489
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
SINCE WHEN?

39:27.530 --> 39:29.111
YES, I'M UPSET.

39:29.150 --> 39:30.219
SETH, WHATEVER YOU DO,

39:30.260 --> 39:32.046
DO NOT LET HIM OUT
OF YOUR SIGHT, DO YOU HEAR ME?

39:32.090 --> 39:33.057
I AM ON MY WAY.

39:33.090 --> 39:35.809
I'M GETTING IN THE CAR
RIGHT NOW. GOOD-BYE.

39:35.850 --> 39:38.842
HE'S IN
MOTHER-FREAKIN' FRESNO.

39:39.860 --> 39:42.192

39:50.140 --> 39:52.131
I'LL DO THIS.

40:18.860 --> 40:23.206
- DREW, HONEY.
HEY. HEY.

40:27.870 --> 40:30.213
- UH, IT'S JUST NOT
A REAL GOOD TIME RIGHT NOW.

40:30.250 --> 40:32.480
I MEAN, I GOT THESE ROAD DATES
THAT MIGHT COME UP,

40:32.530 --> 40:34.691
AND IT'S--

40:38.360 --> 40:41.249
- IT'S OKAY.
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

40:41.300 --> 40:42.494
IS THE FAMILY GOOD?

40:42.540 --> 40:44.258
- THANKS FOR CALLING, SETH.

40:44.300 --> 40:46.461

40:49.680 --> 40:51.989
SEE YOU SOON, CHAMP.

40:52.030 --> 40:54.715
YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE CAN TAKE IN

[car ignition turns]

41:19.540 --> 41:22.407

41:47.780 --> 41:51.739
YOU DESERVE A GREAT FATHER.

41:51.780 --> 41:56.296

OH, LOOK AT YOU.
