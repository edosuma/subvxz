WEBVTT

00:30.447 --> 00:32.323
[Asma Khan] I have a memory as a child

00:33.074 --> 00:36.369
of a steam train, the Darjeeling Express,

00:38.079 --> 00:40.248
that runs through the foothills
of the Himalayas.

00:42.417 --> 00:45.670
It makes all this
huffing and puffing noise.

00:45.754 --> 00:48.048
[train chugging]

00:48.214 --> 00:50.717
[Khan] As it went up 
higher into the mountains,

00:52.093 --> 00:55.555
you leave the heat
and absolute crazy humidity of Calcutta.

00:57.140 --> 01:00.268
The relief of the air being so cool...

01:01.686 --> 01:03.313
Absolutely spectacular.

01:05.774 --> 01:10.278
I remember, as a child,
putting my head out of the window.

01:12.489 --> 01:13.823
I would call my name out,

01:16.367 --> 01:19.662
and the entire mountain
would echo my name back to me.

01:24.417 --> 01:29.089
That was my moment of freedom,
of liberation.

01:31.841 --> 01:34.511
I controlled where my life was going.

01:36.262 --> 01:41.434
I knew, one day,
everybody would know my name.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.525
[theme music playing]

03:06.895 --> 03:09.564
[Vivek Singh]
The Indian dining scene in London

03:09.647 --> 03:12.025
is like no other anywhere else
in the world.

03:12.859 --> 03:18.281
The British have this incredible
and insatiable affection for Indian food.

03:18.865 --> 03:21.492
As a result, there are thousands
of Indian restaurants

03:21.576 --> 03:22.869
at all different levels.

03:22.952 --> 03:25.914
But that doesn't mean
there isn't space for anything new.

03:30.627 --> 03:33.004
[indistinct chatter]

03:41.179 --> 03:45.225
Darjeeling Express challenges pretty much
every preconceived notion

03:45.308 --> 03:47.769
that people have
of traditional Indian restaurants.

03:48.770 --> 03:49.896
[Khan] Are we ready to serve?

03:50.021 --> 03:51.272
[woman] Unh huh. The rice is hot.

03:51.356 --> 03:52.607
[Khan] Okay, fine, yeah.

03:52.690 --> 03:53.608
[bell dings]

03:58.029 --> 04:03.326
[Singh] Asma explores the entire gamut
of various different influences.

04:04.327 --> 04:07.455
Her cuisine ranges
from Calcutta street food

04:07.538 --> 04:12.043
to the royal court influence
that comes from her family.

04:12.877 --> 04:17.674
What's really beautiful is that
it is not put together in a formulaic way.

04:17.757 --> 04:22.428
It is about saying,
"This is the stuff that I really love.

04:22.929 --> 04:26.599
These are the dishes and this is the menu
that I want everybody to try."

04:27.267 --> 04:28.768
And I think that is a beautiful thing.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.104
[Khan] Most paneers
are made with lots of cream,

04:31.187 --> 04:34.482
but my mother used to always
make it like this, so...

04:34.565 --> 04:37.527
In Bengal, we use tons and tons
of  kalonji,  so it's a bit unusual.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.904
[Pascal Gerard-Barker]
When you go to Darjeeling Express,

04:39.988 --> 04:42.740
Asma will tell you
the history of every dish

04:42.824 --> 04:47.370
and how it relates to perhaps her family
or the historical side of India,

04:47.662 --> 04:49.539
but also the emotional connection

04:49.622 --> 04:52.625
that she and the people
who cook in her kitchen

04:52.709 --> 04:54.419
have with the food that she makes.

04:57.797 --> 05:00.675
[Holly O'Neill]
Asma Khan assembled this amazing kitchen,

05:01.342 --> 05:03.720
a kitchen entirely staffed by women.

05:05.930 --> 05:08.641
Women who had,
previous to working with her,

05:08.725 --> 05:10.977
never worked
in a professional kitchen before.

05:14.689 --> 05:18.192
I don't know who would do that,
but then I met Asma,

05:18.609 --> 05:20.069
and I realized who would do that.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.740
[Khan] Two brown rice?
Isn't that a bit boring?

05:23.823 --> 05:24.657
[woman laughs]

05:24.741 --> 05:26.534
I'm not saying anything, but just...

05:26.617 --> 05:27.493
[laughter]

05:27.577 --> 05:29.495
[man] We're pretending
to try to be healthy, though.

05:30.705 --> 05:32.874
-This you should have with white rice.
-[woman] Okay.

05:32.957 --> 05:34.334
Enjoy life, my dear.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.127
-[laughing]
-[Khan] Yeah.

05:37.211 --> 05:42.342
[O'Neill] She's incredibly passionate,
inspired and inspirational.

05:42.884 --> 05:47.430
Asma could tell me trees were pink
and planted upside down,

05:47.513 --> 05:51.017
and I'd probably believe
anything Asma told me,

05:51.100 --> 05:53.102
because she is so charming.

05:53.519 --> 05:56.147
Please don't be polite.
Don't wait for everyone else to eat.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.524
And why are you waiting?

05:59.150 --> 06:01.527
-For me to come and pass the plate?
-[women laughing]

06:03.196 --> 06:04.530
I'll get you your chutney.

06:13.706 --> 06:15.708
[Asha singing in Hindi]

06:15.792 --> 06:18.544
-[Asma singing in Hindi]
-[Asha laughing]

06:20.004 --> 06:21.756
[Asha singing in Hindi]

06:21.839 --> 06:23.341
[both laughing]

06:29.097 --> 06:31.349
[Khan in English] I think the world
is big enough for everybody.

06:36.687 --> 06:37.688
People are people.

06:38.523 --> 06:41.567
There are no divisions in my kitchen
or in my restaurant.

06:44.112 --> 06:48.324
We always say,
"The guest is an incarnation of God."

06:51.327 --> 06:56.374
I want people to feel
that they are valued.

06:57.750 --> 07:02.380
They will be looked after
as if they've gone to a relative's house.

07:05.883 --> 07:11.180
I'm cooking food from my home,
from meals I've had in my family.

07:13.891 --> 07:15.768
I tell them the stories of the dishes.

07:17.478 --> 07:21.774
I'm taking their hand
and taking them along.

07:26.320 --> 07:30.491
My aim is for you to leave
feeling like someone had embraced you.

07:33.619 --> 07:35.121
That's how food should be.

07:36.873 --> 07:41.169
I get happiness from seeing people's eyes
when they eat the food I've cooked.

07:42.920 --> 07:47.008
That feeling, when you can
light up someone's soul

07:47.091 --> 07:48.676
with something you prepared,

07:50.928 --> 07:54.056
that is a privilege and an honor.

08:13.743 --> 08:15.244
When I started cooking,

08:15.328 --> 08:19.415
I wanted people to have something
that reminded them

08:19.499 --> 08:21.417
of really, really exciting, happy times.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.880
Big celebrations, big family weddings.

08:27.465 --> 08:28.758
You never forget your first biryani.

08:32.136 --> 08:36.015
The biryani that I make
is called the  dum biryani,

08:36.599 --> 08:38.768
and  dum  is basically steam.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.647
The whole process is layering.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.359
At the very bottom, the meat,

08:47.818 --> 08:50.821
spices, saffron-infused milk.

08:52.573 --> 08:53.533
Potatoes go on top.

08:55.243 --> 08:57.036
The rice goes above the potatoes.

08:58.287 --> 08:59.580
And we seal it with dough.

09:00.164 --> 09:02.542
And it's gone. You cannot see it.

09:03.209 --> 09:04.544
You don't know what's happening.

09:05.586 --> 09:07.630
What holds that biryani together is faith.

09:09.298 --> 09:11.717
[Singh] So many things can go wrong
with your biryani.

09:12.802 --> 09:15.471
Changes with the quality of rice,
the age of rice,

09:15.972 --> 09:18.182
the amount of time it's had
in the spicing.

09:19.892 --> 09:22.228
Even with 25 years
of cooking professionally,

09:24.522 --> 09:26.274
I get butterflies in my stomach.

09:31.529 --> 09:32.989
[Khan] When we're ready to serve,

09:34.073 --> 09:35.324
we mix it.

09:38.286 --> 09:42.623
That's when this amazing,
beautiful aroma comes up.

09:44.292 --> 09:47.420
You smell the history, the spice trade.

09:50.506 --> 09:53.843
And when the rice is served,
every grain is perfect.

09:55.803 --> 10:00.224
[Singh] A lot of things that Asma does
is about feeding people lots of food,

10:00.308 --> 10:03.394
and a biryani is that ultimate dish.

10:04.395 --> 10:06.647
It is an expression of her generosity.

10:07.273 --> 10:11.444
That is what makes Asma's biryani
quite special.

10:13.571 --> 10:16.574
If you had to eat one thing
at Darjeeling Express,

10:17.199 --> 10:19.327
in my mind, it's got to be the biryani.

10:27.752 --> 10:30.087
-[father] A desi mango--
-[Khan] Is a generic mango?

10:30.171 --> 10:31.255
Or is it actually a variety?

10:31.339 --> 10:34.508
[father] It is the original mango
of this area,

10:34.592 --> 10:37.011
but, you see,
Dasheri is not very popular.

10:37.094 --> 10:38.763
-It doesn't travel well.
-Hmm.

10:40.264 --> 10:44.518
[Khan] Centuries ago, my father's family
were nomadic warriors.

10:45.436 --> 10:47.772
We would go in and fight
with whoever could afford us.

10:49.023 --> 10:52.610
Eventually, we left the desert
and settled down in India.

10:53.402 --> 10:56.572
We acquired orchards, we grew roots.

10:58.366 --> 11:02.161
[father] I remember you, as a child,
you used to be put on the floor,

11:02.244 --> 11:05.873
-and you were just given the seed.
-[laughs] I've heard this story.

11:05.956 --> 11:08.376
[father] And chomp, chomp, chomp,
you used to eat it.

11:08.459 --> 11:10.586
[Khan] And you used to sit
and watch me eat it, yeah.

11:11.045 --> 11:14.090
When I was very young,
the mango orchard was always the place

11:14.173 --> 11:15.925
we would go to with my father.

11:17.134 --> 11:20.388
My father loves to talk
about the fact that, in the 19th century,

11:20.471 --> 11:22.515
at the Great British Exhibition,

11:22.598 --> 11:26.477
the family mangoes were declared
as the best mango in the world.

11:27.311 --> 11:30.064
The same soil
has three varieties of mangos.

11:30.147 --> 11:32.983
[father] Yeah, the Langra
and the Dasheri and the Chaunsa.

11:33.067 --> 11:37.530
-Langra is the best.
-I disagree. I prefer the Chaunsa.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.408
On this, we'll forever, forever disagree.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.786
[Khan] We used to have 
these long conversations.

11:44.870 --> 11:47.331
He would cut open three or four varieties.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.209
"What do you taste?"

11:51.961 --> 11:53.754
He wanted to explain to us

11:53.838 --> 11:59.009
the differences of flavors, acidity,
sweetness, texture.

12:00.803 --> 12:03.139
Each mango is individually unique.

12:04.515 --> 12:06.934
I think his thing was
that we must understand

12:07.017 --> 12:09.019
this gift from the soil.

12:13.274 --> 12:17.153
One day, he took me
to my family ancestral fortress,

12:18.863 --> 12:21.407
and he took me up to one of the towers,

12:22.408 --> 12:25.494
and he pointed out
the slums that were below.

12:32.668 --> 12:34.503
He said, "It's an accident of birth.

12:35.504 --> 12:38.048
You could have been there,
or you could have been here."

12:42.470 --> 12:46.974
And he told me, "Use your life
to make a difference...

12:49.226 --> 12:53.606
because being in a position of privilege,
you have a duty

12:55.816 --> 12:57.067
to lift others up."

13:00.571 --> 13:05.701
That kind of education,
it left a deep impact on me.

13:30.017 --> 13:32.603
In India, when a girl is born,

13:33.604 --> 13:35.731
there's no celebration and no fireworks.

13:39.610 --> 13:42.279
It's that moment of darkness in a family.

13:44.240 --> 13:48.118
And when you're unlucky enough
to have another girl,

13:48.536 --> 13:53.374
it is not like a life,
but almost like a death.

13:55.709 --> 13:58.254
My mother cried at my birth.

14:00.047 --> 14:02.091
I was born a second daughter.

14:10.933 --> 14:13.811
We have an archaic tradition of dowry.

14:16.438 --> 14:19.483
Families have to have
this grand Indian wedding.

14:20.818 --> 14:25.197
They gift jewelry.
They buy a flat for the husband.

14:26.657 --> 14:28.075
It can wipe them out financially.

14:30.578 --> 14:31.912
A girl is a burden.

14:37.084 --> 14:40.754
Before I was born,
my mother would constantly be told,

14:40.838 --> 14:43.257
"I hope this one is going to be a boy."

14:44.425 --> 14:46.218
And no, lo and behold, it was me.

14:48.512 --> 14:54.059
I remember so well, people pointing
to me and saying, "That's it?"

14:57.229 --> 15:00.441
I saw that disappointment in their eyes.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.571
I used to feel sad for my mother.

15:07.656 --> 15:09.366
And I used to feel angry.

15:13.287 --> 15:15.122
Why am I just "it"?

15:17.833 --> 15:22.671
I want to erase that moment
when they told her it was a girl.

15:24.548 --> 15:28.552
I can't wipe those tears,
but what I can do

15:29.803 --> 15:32.264
is bring pride into my mother's eyes,

15:33.140 --> 15:35.017
become this amazing thing,

15:36.435 --> 15:37.603
leave a mark,

15:38.395 --> 15:44.944
a mark so deep that no one cares
that I was a second daughter.

15:58.123 --> 16:00.376
-I think you're putting too much.
-[Amna] No, Asma, I'm telling you...

16:00.459 --> 16:02.252
I promise you, you're gonna love
what I'm doing.

16:02.878 --> 16:05.631
-Show me and explain everything to me.
-My favorite blush-on in the world.

16:05.714 --> 16:06.840
Oh, this is very pink.
I'm not gonna put it.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.676
No, Asma, it's gonna blend into your face.

16:08.759 --> 16:10.302
Amna, nothing will blend in.

16:10.386 --> 16:12.471
-I promise you, two dots.
-I'll look like a joker.

16:12.554 --> 16:16.141
-One, two, okay?
-Two dots on both sides.

16:17.184 --> 16:18.978
You remember getting dressed up
when we were little?

16:19.228 --> 16:21.897
-Yeah, I hated it.
-I know.

16:22.272 --> 16:25.985
-And you tortured me.
-I know, but it was all for a good reason.

16:26.652 --> 16:30.447
-Don't make me nervous, okay?
-I'm... If you're nervous, I'll do it.

16:30.531 --> 16:33.450
-Okay, then, do it.
-Okay, tell me, no?

16:33.534 --> 16:35.369
-Yeah.
-I'll do myself.

16:36.912 --> 16:39.289
As a child, I was a real tomboy,

16:40.290 --> 16:42.418
running wild, climbing trees, falling off.

16:44.086 --> 16:46.380
My father would find me
on the street playing cricket.

16:46.755 --> 16:47.923
I used to be dragged home.

16:48.924 --> 16:52.928
I think I was trying to be
a boy for my mother.

16:54.638 --> 16:57.891
And I had this awesome reputation
of being the wild child,

16:58.434 --> 16:59.935
you know, really out of control.

17:01.729 --> 17:03.480
They couldn't find a boy to marry me,

17:04.231 --> 17:06.817
'cause whoever they approached,
they were like, "Oh, no, no, not her."

17:07.401 --> 17:08.277
[Khan] Ow, ow, ow.

17:08.360 --> 17:11.447
-I'm taking this off. I wanna--
-It's beautiful. It's regal.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.240
-Doesn't matter.
-It makes you look like a princess.

17:13.323 --> 17:16.660
[Khan] I am a princess. I don't have to
wear all this to show I'm a princess.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.203
[groans] It's stuck in my hair.

17:18.537 --> 17:20.956
[Khan] So, my parents had to let me go
to college.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.877
That is when everything changed.

17:26.503 --> 17:29.506
I met the most suitable boy
I could have married.

17:30.090 --> 17:33.052
An academic, a gold medalist
from Oxford University.

17:34.303 --> 17:37.723
An innocent man who walked in
having no idea what I was.

17:40.392 --> 17:43.771
I really liked him,
and I wanted to marry someone

17:43.854 --> 17:46.440
who respected me for my intellect.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.069
And we got married and I moved to London.

17:53.530 --> 17:57.659
It was a big deal.
My parents, they were very proud.

17:58.368 --> 17:59.787
My father really liked Mushtaq.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.373
Everyone thought
this was just ideal for me.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.585
I was ready to go
and live this beautiful life.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.390
[church bell tolls]

18:32.319 --> 18:35.739
Living in England,
I wanted to do something useful.

18:37.407 --> 18:39.618
I always just wanted
to be taken seriously.

18:41.370 --> 18:44.623
I have always done things
that would make my parents proud of me.

18:46.041 --> 18:47.417
So I decided to study law.

18:48.877 --> 18:53.173
I did the law degree, and I went
straight into the PhD program.

18:54.675 --> 18:56.677
My father loved calling me Dr. Asma.

18:58.303 --> 18:59.930
This is how it's supposed to be.

19:00.681 --> 19:02.266
You're supposed to have this great life,

19:02.641 --> 19:04.643
and you're in this foreign land,
which is very exciting.

19:07.104 --> 19:12.734
But over time, I had this kind of constant
feeling of "something's not right."

19:14.862 --> 19:17.156
[indistinct speech on loud speaker]

19:17.906 --> 19:22.244
My husband was teaching all the time,
and I had no friends.

19:24.788 --> 19:29.209
There was this kind of
vast emptiness in me.

19:31.503 --> 19:32.838
I felt that all the time.

19:35.424 --> 19:38.719
I spoke to my parents once a week
on a three-minute call.

19:39.136 --> 19:42.264
I spent most of my time
telling my parents I'm okay,

19:42.848 --> 19:44.766
and I put the phone down,

19:44.850 --> 19:48.562
and it was a lump so big
for all the things I couldn't say.

19:51.732 --> 19:53.442
I was very lonely.

19:54.401 --> 19:55.903
Okay, so just do one.

19:55.986 --> 19:59.823
[Khan] I had left my home, my family.

20:02.618 --> 20:05.078
I saw so many people
who would smile at me,

20:07.706 --> 20:11.126
but I couldn't relate to anything
or to anyone.

20:14.755 --> 20:19.384
It was a kind of strange,
isolated existence.

20:25.015 --> 20:28.143
One day, when I was cycling,

20:29.144 --> 20:30.896
I went a little further
than I normally do,

20:32.481 --> 20:33.899
and I passed this house.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.861
I could smell someone was making  paratha.

20:39.863 --> 20:41.740
That smell that you get
when you burn butter,

20:42.157 --> 20:43.408
that beautiful smell,

20:44.910 --> 20:47.246
that was the smell from home.

20:48.747 --> 20:51.541
It was my entire childhood.

20:53.335 --> 20:56.213
I wanted to have the courage
to ring the bell,

20:58.048 --> 20:59.466
but, instead, I cried.

21:02.970 --> 21:06.431
I felt so helpless

21:07.975 --> 21:10.519
and so angry with myself.

21:12.771 --> 21:17.317
I didn't know how to make paratha.
I didn't know how to make anything.

21:19.444 --> 21:21.780
I knew I had to go home.

21:24.283 --> 21:27.160
[distant traffic noise]

21:37.170 --> 21:39.715
[traffic noise continues]

21:42.551 --> 21:44.553
-[bell rings]
-[crowd chatter]

21:47.931 --> 21:49.599
[Khan] When I came back to India,

21:50.350 --> 21:55.939
I had to tell my mother
that I am just dying.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.943
I was deeply unhappy.

22:01.194 --> 22:02.529
I was just drifting.

22:04.781 --> 22:06.616
My mother said,
"You're crying because you're hungry.

22:07.784 --> 22:11.163
Hungry for food that tasted like home."

22:13.081 --> 22:15.292
She said,
"I'm going to teach you how to cook."

22:23.216 --> 22:26.678
In the Indian tradition,
there are these iconic dishes

22:27.721 --> 22:30.307
that people have carried
through generations.

22:33.643 --> 22:35.645
For so many South-Asian women,

22:36.355 --> 22:40.275
their signature dishes
means honor and respect.

22:43.320 --> 22:47.449
Women in my family built up
these reputations for certain dishes.

22:49.451 --> 22:54.081
And that recipe, they never part with,
not even to their own daughter.

23:00.837 --> 23:02.547
[Asma speaking indistinctly in Hindi]

23:02.631 --> 23:04.549
[in English] My mom and all my aunts
and my grandmother,

23:05.300 --> 23:09.096
they must have seen
the huge emptiness in my soul.

23:10.889 --> 23:14.351
Everybody understood.
Everybody rallied around me.

23:14.976 --> 23:16.937
"Let's get the lists out.
Let's start teaching you."

23:18.480 --> 23:19.689
I stood next to them.

23:20.565 --> 23:23.777
I watched.
I listened to what they were telling me,

23:24.236 --> 23:26.530
and I absorbed everything.

23:28.448 --> 23:29.574
Give me that.

23:31.076 --> 23:35.122
[Khan] The smells and the aromas
and the actions,

23:35.705 --> 23:37.082
there's a rhythm to it.

23:42.587 --> 23:46.716
It's that beat that hits you here,
and you hear it again and again.

23:48.593 --> 23:53.682
And then in the end, it all becomes
this beautiful, almost magical song.

23:55.934 --> 24:02.524
So, I inherited this fabulous legacy
of guarded signature dishes.

24:03.692 --> 24:06.987
It is embedded in my soul.

24:13.827 --> 24:15.745
[indistinct chatter]

24:19.458 --> 24:21.293
[men singing indistinctly]

24:25.797 --> 24:28.550
[singing qawwali]

24:56.411 --> 24:59.331
[Khan] I went back home to the UK
a different person.

25:00.707 --> 25:01.833
I started cooking.

25:02.501 --> 25:05.420
Oh, my God, my husband was
flat on the ground, he was so shocked.

25:08.548 --> 25:11.009
I love this.
You can try every kind of vinegar.

25:13.053 --> 25:15.680
At that time, there was a school
opposite my house.

25:16.848 --> 25:19.476
I saw some South-Asian women.

25:20.268 --> 25:23.605
Many of them were working as nannies,
as housekeepers,

25:24.022 --> 25:25.649
with families that were European.

25:26.691 --> 25:28.693
Strangers in a foreign land.

25:29.236 --> 25:30.946
They were in the same position as me.

25:31.488 --> 25:32.531
[woman] Cheers! Thank you.

25:33.198 --> 25:35.367
[Khan] I told them,
"Come and have tea with me."

25:36.368 --> 25:39.204
I had learned how to make
seriously good chai.

25:41.456 --> 25:44.417
When they came to my house,
we made friends.

25:44.834 --> 25:46.461
I started cooking for them.

25:47.754 --> 25:49.881
It felt so wonderful.

25:53.176 --> 25:55.470
We felt like we were back in India.

25:55.887 --> 25:57.639
[women exclaiming]

25:58.723 --> 26:01.351
[Khan] And then slowly,
they started coming more often.

26:02.978 --> 26:04.145
Everything changed.

26:05.772 --> 26:09.401
I ended up with a group
who I would consider now my sisters.

26:11.695 --> 26:15.198
This was the best part of my life.

26:15.282 --> 26:16.408
[women laughing]

26:16.491 --> 26:21.913
Having the ability to cook was,
for me, the huge transformation.

26:22.497 --> 26:27.127
How I felt about life,
where I lived, myself...

26:29.254 --> 26:30.839
Now, this feels like home.

26:46.479 --> 26:47.939
[indistinct chatter]

26:48.023 --> 26:51.526
[Khan] I had a neighbor who told me
that he went to a supper club.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.862
He described an underground restaurant.

26:53.945 --> 26:56.031
I thought that was so cool.

26:56.114 --> 26:58.158
My whole life, I've wanted
to do something illegal.

26:58.241 --> 26:59.951
So, he was like, "No, it's not illegal.

27:00.035 --> 27:02.078
It's just that you call people
to your house,

27:02.162 --> 27:04.080
and you feed them, and they pay you."

27:04.164 --> 27:07.834
And I thought,
"This sounds like something I can do."

27:14.049 --> 27:16.468
When I talked about my supper club
to my friends,

27:17.052 --> 27:19.012
they were like,
"We'd like to help prepare the meal."

27:20.722 --> 27:22.724
There were three,
four of us in the kitchen.

27:22.807 --> 27:24.976
They did all the prep. I cooked the food.

27:25.852 --> 27:28.396
It was very small in the beginning.

27:30.231 --> 27:32.609
My children would wander off
into their rooms.

27:33.234 --> 27:34.903
And luckily my husband
was traveling a lot.

27:35.487 --> 27:38.114
He was not really aware at that time
that I was doing it.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.700
Maybe I lied a bit and didn't tell him.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.622
I started getting a lot of pressure
from people.

27:45.705 --> 27:48.750
Like, "I'd really like to bring my boss,"
and, "I wanna bring my partner."

27:49.417 --> 27:51.002
And it grew in number.

27:59.386 --> 28:02.055
People would put stuff up on social media.

28:02.681 --> 28:06.226
People wrote blogs about it.
Strangers would write to me saying,

28:06.309 --> 28:07.894
"I've seen these pictures.
I'd really like to come."

28:09.562 --> 28:11.564
And slowly, I had a following of people.

28:12.607 --> 28:15.902
I was basically having huge parties.

28:17.028 --> 28:20.365
Twenty-five to thirty people,
grand banquet.

28:21.449 --> 28:24.035
Random strangers are sitting around
and eating the food,

28:24.119 --> 28:25.745
and then in the end everyone was friends.

28:27.580 --> 28:29.290
I always saw supper clubs

28:29.374 --> 28:33.795
as a bridge between my culture and me
and someone else.

28:34.337 --> 28:37.090
And feeding them was that bridge
to get to them.

28:38.591 --> 28:40.844
[all chattering and laughing]

28:43.638 --> 28:45.348
[Khan] Yeah.
Make sure that it's round, yeah.

28:45.890 --> 28:46.850
That will be fine.

28:46.933 --> 28:48.768
-[man] Okay...
-[Khan] That had too many cracks.

28:48.852 --> 28:51.229
Don't try and force those issues,
because you can't.

28:53.189 --> 28:56.401
Very good. Just like... Yeah, yeah.

28:57.068 --> 28:58.027
Now, turn it.

29:01.197 --> 29:04.409
I continued doing supper clubs at my home.

29:04.951 --> 29:06.828
Those were brilliant cooking days.

29:07.412 --> 29:11.374
I cooked all night, I cooked all day,

29:12.125 --> 29:14.794
and I loved it. This was my calling.

29:17.297 --> 29:20.884
The supper clubs became an issue
when my children got a little older.

29:22.343 --> 29:25.054
They didn't complain to me,
they complained to my dad.

29:28.725 --> 29:32.312
My father,
who's a really mild-tempered person,

29:33.313 --> 29:35.815
just said, "This is unacceptable."

29:36.816 --> 29:38.276
My parents were not impressed.

29:39.360 --> 29:41.613
I had not even considered
the kids' feelings.

29:42.697 --> 29:44.949
He said,
"You've gotta shut the supper clubs."

29:46.576 --> 29:47.869
I was quite stunned.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.915
I asked my family how they felt.

29:54.042 --> 29:57.420
My husband tolerated it.
Angry, but silent.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.341
But my kids hated it.

30:02.675 --> 30:07.514
They told me this was horrible
that there were people in the house,

30:07.972 --> 30:11.559
and it was so chaotic,
and it was not a nice way to live.

30:13.520 --> 30:15.563
I was ashamed.

30:16.940 --> 30:19.526
I had not seen things
from their perspective.

30:21.361 --> 30:24.614
In my own excitement and joy of cooking,

30:24.906 --> 30:29.869
I had forgotten that my children
also have equal rights in that house.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.874
This was something that I felt
was so wrong,

30:34.958 --> 30:37.210
that had been done to girls
in our families.

30:37.293 --> 30:39.504
That girls were not asked their opinion.

30:41.798 --> 30:45.760
No pleasure I was getting
was worth making my kids unhappy.

30:49.347 --> 30:51.975
And I promised them that I will stop.

30:54.519 --> 30:55.520
And I stopped.

31:10.910 --> 31:16.916
It was painful to stop something
that had given me a direction.

31:19.627 --> 31:23.339
[women speaking in Hindi]

31:25.258 --> 31:26.968
[Khan] When I first told my family

31:27.051 --> 31:28.970
that this was what I really wanted to do,

31:29.387 --> 31:31.931
the common response was silence.

31:32.807 --> 31:34.225
The silence says everything.

31:34.809 --> 31:36.728
The silence was major disapproval.

31:38.187 --> 31:41.065
I was the first female PhD in my family.

31:42.233 --> 31:43.902
Most of my cousins
never even went to college.

31:44.986 --> 31:49.198
They thought, "You're in London.
You have a law degree. You wanna cook?"

31:50.575 --> 31:53.202
I think that everyone was just like,
you know, "Why?"

31:56.456 --> 31:59.125
Because it made me happy.

32:00.543 --> 32:03.379
And now, I wasn't alone.

32:07.759 --> 32:12.472
In my community, South-Asian women,
we are hidden behind a wall.

32:15.016 --> 32:19.854
It is an anonymous, faceless,
nameless existence.

32:23.024 --> 32:24.609
I saw in these women...

32:25.818 --> 32:28.696
that fire, the desire...

32:30.365 --> 32:31.324
the joy.

32:33.660 --> 32:35.787
We all were on that same journey together.

32:39.040 --> 32:42.627
I knew I just had to find a way.

32:52.720 --> 32:55.890
[Asma speaking indistinctly in Hindi]

32:56.975 --> 32:58.851
[in English] I had to find an alternative.

33:00.144 --> 33:02.605
I ventured at a couple of people

33:03.189 --> 33:07.485
and I unexpectedly met someone
who told me, "Your food is really good.

33:07.568 --> 33:10.905
Why don't you go to Soho and do a pop-up
in my husband's pub?"

33:11.823 --> 33:12.991
I decided to go.

33:14.033 --> 33:17.120
We were doing a series of food pop-ups
with kitchen residencies.

33:18.329 --> 33:21.541
Asma presented me with a  puchka,
which I've never had before,

33:21.624 --> 33:23.876
a little Calcuttan street snack.

33:24.502 --> 33:29.257
I was immediately taken by it,
and I knew that there's something there.

33:31.259 --> 33:33.011
[Khan] I really had doubts.

33:34.012 --> 33:36.764
The first time I saw the pub kitchen,
I was so shocked,

33:36.848 --> 33:39.058
because I didn't even know
what half the things were.

33:39.142 --> 33:42.770
I'd never seen a big fryer like that.
I could fry myself in it.

33:44.105 --> 33:47.108
It was all a bit scary.
Everything was intimidating.

33:47.817 --> 33:50.445
[women speaking Hindi]

33:53.948 --> 33:56.325
[Pascal] The first few days,
it was chaotic.

33:56.409 --> 33:58.286
I went into the kitchen and it was...

33:59.454 --> 34:01.622
it was like an explosion
had gone in there.

34:01.706 --> 34:03.207
It was a bit of a disaster.

34:03.791 --> 34:06.836
She was used to making
a family-style supper club.

34:07.420 --> 34:09.714
So it was a big change for them.

34:10.590 --> 34:12.759
[Khan] All of us were home cooks.

34:13.760 --> 34:17.847
We had absolutely no clue,
were scrambling around like mad.

34:20.016 --> 34:21.893
Sometimes we ran out of food.

34:23.478 --> 34:25.313
The guests were really genuinely angry.

34:36.407 --> 34:37.658
It was very embarrassing.

34:39.952 --> 34:42.371
I felt that I was letting everyone down.

34:44.791 --> 34:47.043
A lot of people said
I should get a professional chef.

34:49.921 --> 34:50.963
I couldn't do it.

34:52.590 --> 34:54.634
I didn't want these women to feel

34:54.717 --> 34:56.677
that their effort
had been taken for granted.

35:00.848 --> 35:02.725
If you stand at the edge of the mountain

35:03.184 --> 35:05.937
and you think you're going to fly,
you will.

35:06.687 --> 35:08.856
You will only fall if you think
you're going to fall.

35:17.490 --> 35:19.575
Losing was not an option.

35:21.702 --> 35:23.496
I go into every battle to win.

35:25.623 --> 35:29.794
I didn't know how I was gonna do it,
so I winged it.

35:32.672 --> 35:34.257
I started talking to customers.

35:34.882 --> 35:37.385
I spent a lot of time apologizing.

35:38.302 --> 35:42.390
And when food ran out, I used to write
"I owe you" vouchers.

35:43.057 --> 35:45.685
"Free Tangra prawn for next time.
I owe you."

35:46.853 --> 35:48.980
We all learned at the same time.

35:49.438 --> 35:53.276
We learned how to multitask
and get the food out.

35:54.193 --> 35:56.112
This was a different kind of training.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.032
People were starting
to take notice of her food.

36:00.950 --> 36:02.243
We were starting to get busier.

36:03.452 --> 36:04.996
You could see them grow as a team.

36:05.079 --> 36:07.665
The bond within that kitchen
was very strong.

36:09.125 --> 36:11.544
Then we get Fay Maschler
from the  Evening Standard.

36:13.504 --> 36:15.673
She'd come in on her 70th birthday.

36:16.841 --> 36:20.761
I mentioned to Asma,
"Look, Fay's here. This is a big thing."

36:21.804 --> 36:27.351
Asma, in her usual way, went straight up
to Fay and started talking.

36:28.477 --> 36:32.148
I was a little concerned
this could be a bit too much.

36:33.691 --> 36:35.902
A week later, Fay's article came out.

36:40.364 --> 36:42.992
It was... spectacular.

36:48.789 --> 36:50.041
From there, it exploded.

36:51.542 --> 36:53.252
[Khan] There were queues of people.

36:54.629 --> 36:56.005
It changed everything.

36:57.840 --> 37:00.468
One night, we had a very,
very busy service.

37:02.178 --> 37:03.930
We managed to feed a lot of people.

37:05.640 --> 37:08.226
One of my women turned around and told me,

37:09.894 --> 37:11.562
"We're just like professional chefs.

37:13.648 --> 37:14.690
We're doing the same thing."

37:18.527 --> 37:20.404
There was just silence in the group.

37:22.490 --> 37:24.909
We all realized,
"Yes, we're just like them."

37:27.954 --> 37:29.163
People were watching us...

37:30.498 --> 37:31.916
and we were in control.

37:35.544 --> 37:39.298
So, I closed my eyes
and I imagined myself flying.

37:54.230 --> 37:55.731
I am very, very lucky.

37:56.774 --> 38:01.070
The meal on my table is not dependent
on my income alone.

38:03.114 --> 38:07.451
But all these women,
they're supporting families back home.

38:10.413 --> 38:12.123
So, when I opened Darjeeling Express,

38:13.082 --> 38:15.751
I didn't let any of them
resign from their positions.

38:17.712 --> 38:19.463
The first few months were hard.

38:21.799 --> 38:23.801
Everybody was still working
somewhere else.

38:27.096 --> 38:29.307
Over time, one by one,

38:30.141 --> 38:32.143
they started cutting back
on their nanny shifts,

38:33.185 --> 38:34.228
giving their notices.

38:36.689 --> 38:40.109
When the last person quit their job
and joined us full-time,

38:41.944 --> 38:44.155
that was my moment
when I put the flag in the sand.

38:46.782 --> 38:49.535
The people who were working
so hard in the restaurant,

38:50.077 --> 38:51.620
they had come home.

38:55.249 --> 38:59.545
When the restaurant happened,
I selected everything.

39:00.838 --> 39:05.217
From the color of the tile
to the blue on the walls, even the plants.

39:07.720 --> 39:11.223
I wanted to have an open kitchen
because I wanted people to see

39:13.476 --> 39:14.894
the hands that cooked the food,

39:17.396 --> 39:20.232
just celebrate the soul of my kitchen.

39:26.030 --> 39:31.243
Now, people are walking
up to my women, ignoring me,

39:33.079 --> 39:36.290
and saying, "Thank you very much.
That was a great meal."

39:39.752 --> 39:42.630
I was watching these women, so blasé...

39:43.297 --> 39:45.633
"You're very welcome.
So glad you liked the meal."

39:50.846 --> 39:52.515
They've taken ownership of the kitchen.

39:54.934 --> 39:57.019
This restaurant is theirs,
as much as mine.

40:54.493 --> 40:57.913
The Darjeeling Express is an oasis
for women.

40:59.039 --> 41:01.292
I've watched these women grow...

41:04.628 --> 41:05.588
...stand tall...

41:08.674 --> 41:09.717
...be proud...

41:12.636 --> 41:17.892
This is what happens to women
when other women stand by them.

41:21.604 --> 41:23.439
Okay, and put the yellow one here also.

41:23.898 --> 41:26.484
Okay, and the other yellow one
over there in the joint.

41:26.567 --> 41:27.485
[mother] Yeah.

41:31.405 --> 41:33.407
[women speaing Hindi]

41:37.995 --> 41:39.580
[Khan] My mother stood by me.

41:40.998 --> 41:42.208
She taught me how to cook.

41:45.169 --> 41:49.423
I wanted to do things that would
make her hold her head up high.

41:53.260 --> 41:56.430
Because I know that it was hard for her
when I was born.

41:57.848 --> 42:01.435
And now she's very, very proud of me.

42:03.729 --> 42:06.524
She tells the whole world,
the whole world...

42:08.692 --> 42:12.988
Yet, I still feel I want to do
something more.

42:17.493 --> 42:19.662
[indistinct chatter]

42:22.456 --> 42:24.792
[Khan] I've had a chance
to start a charity.

42:28.629 --> 42:34.218
The aim of this charity is to celebrate
the birth of second daughters.

42:39.890 --> 42:42.059
We pay for a party.

42:45.145 --> 42:46.313
We pay for sweets...

42:50.359 --> 42:51.735
and fireworks.

42:54.822 --> 42:56.407
It's a loud proclamation.

43:03.080 --> 43:04.164
It says something.

43:07.835 --> 43:11.880
If you think that you are unwanted,
that you are not equal...

43:14.800 --> 43:15.884
that you won't be allowed.

43:18.512 --> 43:19.888
You can do anything.

43:26.437 --> 43:28.314
[dramatic music playing]
