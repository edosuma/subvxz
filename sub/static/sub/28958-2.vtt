00:01.359 --> 00:02.730
<i>My name is Talon.</i>

00:02.800 --> 00:04.436
<i>I'm the last Blackblood,
or so I've been told.</i>

00:04.460 --> 00:07.100
<i>I escaped when Everit Dred
killed all my people.</i>

00:07.110 --> 00:10.100
<i>I cut off the points of my ears
to hide in plain sight.</i>

00:10.180 --> 00:12.230
<i>A tiny creature lives inside me,</i>

00:12.240 --> 00:14.070
<i>passed to me by my dying mother.</i>

00:14.150 --> 00:16.980
<i>It gives me the power to open
portals to another world</i>

00:17.060 --> 00:19.610
<i>and summon powerful demons
called Lu-Quri.</i>

00:19.620 --> 00:21.820
<i>But I can only summon them
when I have their names,</i>

00:21.830 --> 00:23.990
<i>something that's proving
to be a challenge.</i>

00:24.070 --> 00:26.920
<i>The Prime Order wants me dead,
but I've found sanctuary</i>

00:27.000 --> 00:30.370
<i>at the farthest edge of the Realm
in a place known as the Outpost.</i>

00:30.450 --> 00:32.670
<i>Previously on "The Outpost"...</i>

00:32.750 --> 00:35.090
So, if I'm going to help Gwynn,
I need to open the portal

00:35.170 --> 00:37.210
and summon all of the demons
by name to this Realm.

00:37.290 --> 00:40.930
- You summoned another demon?
- And a Blackblood.

00:41.010 --> 00:43.180
- What happened to your head?
- Guess it wouldn't let her take it from me.

00:43.190 --> 00:45.550
Your word you'll free my family?

00:45.630 --> 00:47.930
- You have my word.
- If people stop taking colipsum,

00:48.010 --> 00:50.270
- they won't become Plaguelings?
- Yes, but it's an addiction.

00:50.280 --> 00:52.610
Munt, this is your new brother.

00:52.690 --> 00:56.150
He's gonna be joining our operation
smuggling colipsum out of the Outpost.

00:56.220 --> 00:59.570
- Where's everyone else, boy?
- We cannot let Dred reach the capital.

01:01.940 --> 01:04.160
- They're all dead.
- What about Garret?

01:04.230 --> 01:09.290
This is for Talon
and your queen.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.870
I'm heading out to bring
my son's body back.

01:11.950 --> 01:15.330
- Bring him home.
- Send out riders to every former noble.

01:15.410 --> 01:18.500
Dare them to stand with you
against the Prime Order tyrants.

01:18.510 --> 01:21.970
- Send for the scribes.
- It's time for a Pureborn to take the Asterkinj.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:46.910 --> 01:48.290
Have you given it some thought?

01:54.530 --> 01:57.500
Don't worry.
Ekkundi isn't here.

01:57.510 --> 02:01.170
He's watching the Dragman.

02:01.250 --> 02:04.520
By your actions, I take it you haven't
come around to seeing the truth.

02:04.590 --> 02:08.300
What truth? You tried to
cut something out of my head

02:08.380 --> 02:11.100
and then kidnapped a child when
you realized you couldn't do it.

02:11.170 --> 02:14.690
I didn't kidnap her.
She came willingly.

02:14.770 --> 02:17.030
She knows her purpose
is to free our people

02:17.110 --> 02:18.940
from the prison world
they were banished to.

02:19.020 --> 02:21.206
If you could see the horrible
place that is the Plain of Ashes,

02:21.230 --> 02:24.320
you would want
to help them, too.

02:24.400 --> 02:27.540
What did your people do so bad
they had to be banished there?

02:27.620 --> 02:31.590
We weren't banished.
We went willingly.

02:31.660 --> 02:32.660
Why?

02:36.290 --> 02:39.170
We were at war with the humans.

02:39.240 --> 02:42.630
We made a plan that our entire war
party, Blackbloods and Lu-Quri,

02:42.710 --> 02:44.946
would go through the portal
and wait in the Plain of Ashes.

02:44.970 --> 02:48.130
Then a member of your tribe
was to sneak behind enemy lines,

02:48.210 --> 02:50.400
reopen the portal there,

02:50.470 --> 02:54.190
and we would make a mass surprise
attack behind their walls.

02:55.850 --> 02:57.070
So what happened?

03:00.220 --> 03:02.940
The portal was never reopened.

03:03.020 --> 03:06.150
Your tribe conspired with
the humans to leave us there.

03:06.230 --> 03:09.160
The Plain of Ashes was just
a prison to lock us away.

03:10.250 --> 03:12.370
We had no way to return.

03:12.440 --> 03:15.540
We didn't have the Asterkinj.

03:15.610 --> 03:17.590
Your ancestors had it.

03:17.670 --> 03:19.170
Asterkinj.

03:21.290 --> 03:22.510
So that's what it's called.

03:25.870 --> 03:29.720
It's the only way
to open the portal.

03:29.790 --> 03:33.760
We trusted in our own kinsman,
but your kind betrayed us.

03:33.770 --> 03:36.730
We've waited all these years
to return to this Realm.

03:39.280 --> 03:40.836
Do you want me
to bring them back through?

03:40.860 --> 03:44.110
No, I will do that.

03:44.180 --> 03:46.400
All you have to do is
transfer the Asterkinj to me.

03:46.480 --> 03:50.700
And why would I trust you?

03:50.770 --> 03:54.290
The Dragman came to you.
She gave you the name of my Lu-Quri.

03:54.370 --> 03:56.370
It wasn't an accident.

03:56.450 --> 04:01.210
The Asterkinj was meant for me.

04:01.280 --> 04:03.460
You know, my teacher said
I'm the one in prophecy

04:03.470 --> 04:05.590
who's supposed to summon demons.

04:05.660 --> 04:08.460
You think you're the one?

04:08.480 --> 04:11.050
Did you really think the
prophecy could be about you?

04:11.130 --> 04:15.100
Your teacher was wrong.
Your blood is unpure.

04:15.170 --> 04:17.320
You could never lead our people.

04:17.390 --> 04:20.100
Give me the Asterkinj.
Be done with it.

04:20.180 --> 04:23.100
Where is the Dragman?

04:23.180 --> 04:24.780
I want to see
that she's all right.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.320
She serves me, not you.

04:29.330 --> 04:33.110
- Then I need to hear that from her.
- So be it.

04:33.190 --> 04:36.540
Come to the same clearing the day
after tomorrow when the sun is setting.

04:38.200 --> 04:39.590
And you'll give her to me?

04:43.160 --> 04:45.460
Have you not been
paying attention?

04:45.540 --> 04:47.090
It is you who will be giving.

04:47.160 --> 04:48.400
You will give me the Asterkinj.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.470
The Dragman stays with me.

04:52.540 --> 04:53.720
No deal.

04:58.220 --> 05:00.860
If you kill me, my Lu-Quri kills
the Dragman and we all lose.

05:12.230 --> 05:14.210
And if you kill me,
the Asterkinj dies with me.

05:19.210 --> 05:21.500
You're good.

05:21.570 --> 05:24.960
Soon we will fight side by side
against our common enemy.

05:25.030 --> 05:26.510
And who may that be?

05:28.220 --> 05:29.720
The humans, of course.

05:38.260 --> 05:41.180
We can keep fighting, but it will solve
nothing and could ruin everything.

05:43.720 --> 05:47.230
Take more time to meditate
about what I've said.

05:47.240 --> 05:49.410
We are family, Talon.

05:49.480 --> 05:52.570
We should work as a team,
you and I.

05:52.580 --> 05:56.820
Two Blackbloods working together
to save our kind.

05:56.900 --> 05:58.750
I'll give you two sundowns
to think about it.

05:58.830 --> 06:02.660
And when you come, come alone.

06:02.740 --> 06:04.550
Don't try to follow me.

06:29.190 --> 06:32.570
Well, don't just stand there.
Close the damn gate, you bloody fools.

06:32.640 --> 06:34.240
There's all sorts
of creatures out there.

06:36.110 --> 06:38.410
Here we go.
Oi! What the...

06:38.480 --> 06:41.410
Just saved your life.
You're welcome.

06:41.490 --> 06:43.790
Talon, the Outpost
is falling apart.

06:43.800 --> 06:46.130
I mean, it's after nightfall,
the gates are wide open,

06:46.210 --> 06:48.466
and I just stopped a guard from
doing colipsum in the streets,

06:48.490 --> 06:49.770
being the bloody hero that I am.

06:49.830 --> 06:51.110
I mean,
Have you even seen Gwynn?

06:51.160 --> 06:52.686
She's not being much
of a leader, is she?

06:52.710 --> 06:54.096
Look, I don't really care
right now. I want a drink.

06:54.120 --> 06:56.380
Oh, she wants a drink.

06:56.460 --> 07:01.050
I've got a full suite, hmm?
Who thinks I'm bluffing?

07:01.130 --> 07:04.820
Hmm? Go on, bet against me.
Go on.

07:04.890 --> 07:07.440
I was bluffing.

07:07.510 --> 07:10.820
Go on. Player, give me
another round.

07:10.900 --> 07:13.610
Wait, wait, wait. Where are you going?
We haven't finished.

07:13.620 --> 07:14.820
What do you think,
you think I'm gonna behead you

07:14.830 --> 07:19.410
or something if you lose? Win.

07:19.480 --> 07:22.740
I want a full table.
I want everyone on this table.

07:22.820 --> 07:26.210
Come on. Her Majesty has important
business to attend to. Thank you.

07:28.200 --> 07:31.170
I have nothing important
to do. Whoo.

07:31.240 --> 07:33.010
Give my winnings to the poor.

07:35.260 --> 07:37.800
What's gotten into you?
Where's Naya?

07:37.880 --> 07:42.850
I sent her away. She was being a
spoilsport, much like you are now.

07:42.860 --> 07:44.850
The Prime Order army
could be on their way.

07:44.860 --> 07:46.520
If you keep this up,
we won't be ready.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.980
Mm, yes, I, uh...
I didn't tell you, actually.

07:50.050 --> 07:52.440
We received some news.

07:52.520 --> 07:53.910
What news?

07:58.280 --> 08:00.660
They've been coming in all day,

08:00.730 --> 08:04.700
replies from the birds
and the riders we sent out.

08:04.710 --> 08:07.550
Every nobleman, ever magistrate,

08:07.620 --> 08:10.620
ever governor in the Realm
is swearing their allegiance

08:10.700 --> 08:14.960
in the war that we started
to the Prime Order...

08:15.040 --> 08:16.670
Against us.

08:16.750 --> 08:19.340
- All of them?
- Yes.

08:19.420 --> 08:22.180
Cowards.
I knew they wouldn't join.

08:22.250 --> 08:24.650
- And now we don't even have...
- This will bring her around.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.190
Mm, Janzo, that...

08:31.450 --> 08:32.450
Mm.

08:37.080 --> 08:39.240
- Gods.
- Skybalt venom.

08:39.320 --> 08:41.700
Sobers you up fast,
also provides a blistering headache

08:41.770 --> 08:43.530
that will last for hours.

08:43.610 --> 08:45.460
How many noblemen
have yet to respond?

08:45.540 --> 08:47.830
I'm not sure.
Not very many.

08:47.900 --> 08:50.920
Have you had any luck
with your translator girl?

08:51.000 --> 08:52.920
- Dragman?
- Yes.

08:52.930 --> 08:54.250
Or have I lost all my chances

08:54.330 --> 08:55.610
of getting a demon army as well?

08:57.460 --> 08:58.920
Look, I'm working on it.

08:58.930 --> 09:00.720
I hate to be the bearer
of more bad news,

09:00.790 --> 09:02.056
but in case you haven't noticed,

09:02.080 --> 09:03.510
the Outpost is in
complete disarray.

09:03.590 --> 09:05.220
The men are unruly.

09:05.300 --> 09:06.930
The fortification efforts
have all but stopped.

09:06.940 --> 09:08.106
A new commander
must be appointed...

09:08.130 --> 09:09.680
There's no one qualified.

09:09.760 --> 09:12.350
Find someone. Anyone.

09:12.430 --> 09:15.200
I will not replace Garret
with just anyone.

09:18.980 --> 09:21.120
You're not replacing Garret.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.610
You're replacing
a base commander.

09:23.620 --> 09:26.120
I'm not the only one
failing at my job here.

09:26.200 --> 09:29.370
- I don't see a demon army arriving any time soon.
- I said I'm working on it.

09:29.450 --> 09:33.040
And, Janzo, how many more recruits have
to die of this Plagueling epidemic?

09:33.050 --> 09:36.380
- Research takes time.
- We don't have time!

09:36.450 --> 09:39.050
Do you know what will happen if
the Prime Order come tomorrow?

09:39.120 --> 09:42.800
I will have to surrender myself
and beg and plead

09:42.810 --> 09:44.550
for the mercy of the people
of this Outpost.

09:44.630 --> 09:46.980
Don't say that.
Don't even think it.

09:47.060 --> 09:49.310
Too many people
have died already.

09:49.320 --> 09:52.220
Garret. Your father.

09:52.300 --> 09:57.310
Yeah, and without them,
who will train the new recruits?

09:57.320 --> 10:00.150
Who will plan the
fortifications and defenses?

10:00.160 --> 10:02.580
Who will lead the men into battle
when the Prime Order comes?

10:05.330 --> 10:07.910
You will.

10:07.980 --> 10:10.990
You've done it once,
you'll do it again.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.330
You're smarter
than every man I know.

10:12.340 --> 10:13.380
I mean, not any ma...

10:24.180 --> 10:25.900
It was always going to
be you, Your Majesty.

10:28.860 --> 10:30.810
How am I going to do this?

10:34.940 --> 10:36.690
With your friends by your side.

10:49.230 --> 10:53.540
And then when the first row of trenches
is complete with spurs, dig another,

10:53.620 --> 10:55.960
staggered from the first
like layers of brick

10:56.030 --> 10:59.040
so that no direct approach
can be made by charging cavalry.

10:59.050 --> 11:02.670
Your Majesty, we don't have enough
men to fill that many trenches.

11:02.750 --> 11:04.800
We'll have to make do
until our allies arrive.

11:04.870 --> 11:07.220
We will have allies?

11:07.290 --> 11:11.680
Captain, only the most cowardly
nobles will neglect our call to war.

11:11.760 --> 11:14.230
When should we expect them,
Your Majesty?

11:14.310 --> 11:18.400
I hope by the time you've dug
the barrier trenches, Captain.

11:27.910 --> 11:29.070
But there are no allies coming.

11:29.080 --> 11:30.540
He doesn't have to know that.

11:33.660 --> 11:35.910
Naya, I've been meaning to
discuss with you

11:35.920 --> 11:39.420
some thoughts I've had
about the traitor among us.

11:39.430 --> 11:41.750
Naya, are you well?

11:41.760 --> 11:45.760
Oh, uh, it's only that I'm so
concerned about it, the traitor.

11:45.840 --> 11:47.670
Yes, well, with Wythers gone,

11:47.750 --> 11:49.760
I need you to help me
find out who let Dred go.

11:49.770 --> 11:52.440
Yes, of course.

11:52.510 --> 11:54.430
We need to find out
if there was a witness

11:54.440 --> 11:57.180
who saw the perpetrator
go into the prison.

11:57.260 --> 11:59.940
- Do you remember seeing anyone leave suddenly?
- Um, no, Your Majesty.

11:59.950 --> 12:02.270
Oh, no, of course.
You weren't there, were you?

12:02.280 --> 12:03.950
I was cleaning your armor.

12:04.030 --> 12:07.950
There was mud and even
blood splattered.

12:08.030 --> 12:09.780
I'll ask the watchman again,
but by Wythers' account,

12:09.790 --> 12:12.290
most everyone
was with someone that hour.

12:12.370 --> 12:15.620
I'm sure it's only a matter of time
before you discover his identity.

12:15.690 --> 12:17.240
Yes, that's
what Wythers thought.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.580
Only a matter of time.

12:23.290 --> 12:25.590
- What's going on?
- An army approaches, Your Majesty.

12:25.660 --> 12:27.970
- Under what flag?
- Can't say yet, ma'am.

12:35.560 --> 12:40.150
Those are the clan banners
of Rovannus of Aegisford.

12:40.230 --> 12:43.490
Even to fly those banners is in
defiance with the Prime Order law.

12:43.560 --> 12:45.230
They're allies?

12:45.310 --> 12:48.330
Or cleverly disguised enemies.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.240
Whoever it is,
it's not Rovannus.

12:50.320 --> 12:51.950
He'd be more than 60 years old.

12:52.020 --> 12:53.870
Um, may I?

12:56.490 --> 12:58.790
Oh, my.

12:58.800 --> 13:01.330
I mean, yes, I see.

13:01.340 --> 13:04.930
He couldn't be
more than... 30.

13:12.710 --> 13:14.090
These fields are undisturbed.

13:14.170 --> 13:15.330
I told you no one would come.

13:17.170 --> 13:19.270
Makes my proposition
all the more compelling.

13:20.820 --> 13:22.280
Let's go!

13:23.360 --> 13:25.110
Just you and one other.

13:33.190 --> 13:34.190
Your gates are closed.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.370
That's not very welcoming.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.380
We are at war
and must be cautious,

13:38.450 --> 13:40.870
but we are hopeful
at the sight of the banners

13:40.950 --> 13:43.160
- of Rovannus of Aegisford.
- Rovannus was my father.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.290
He died last winter,

13:45.370 --> 13:49.000
and all that was his
is now mine.

13:49.080 --> 13:51.630
I have come by invitation
to see Rosmund,

13:51.710 --> 13:54.050
the alleged daughter
of the fallen King Ranulf.

13:54.130 --> 13:55.840
I am Her Majesty,

13:55.920 --> 13:57.340
Queen Rosmund,

13:57.420 --> 13:59.180
daughter of Ranulf,

13:59.260 --> 14:02.390
the only surviving royal,
and heir to the throne.

14:02.400 --> 14:05.140
I didn't imagine you would be
so beautiful, Your Majesty.

14:05.220 --> 14:08.520
Oh, did I fail to
mention that in my letter?

14:08.600 --> 14:10.940
I didn't think it could
possibly matter to anyone

14:11.020 --> 14:13.080
but the most boorish
of our allies.

14:13.150 --> 14:17.420
Fair points, but can we continue
this intercourse face to face?

14:17.490 --> 14:19.250
We've ridden for two days,

14:19.330 --> 14:21.370
almost from the minute
you invited us.

14:21.450 --> 14:25.330
Your army will camp here
whilst I make preparations.

14:25.410 --> 14:27.470
I will allow you audience
to my throne room.

14:36.790 --> 14:38.720
He is bold, Your Majesty.

14:38.800 --> 14:41.720
Mm, he didn't declare
openly his allegiance,

14:41.800 --> 14:43.680
which means he wants something.

14:43.760 --> 14:48.450
Probably money, land,
and a title, in that order.

14:48.520 --> 14:50.950
But he'll find that
I'm not easy to bargain with.

14:51.030 --> 14:53.570
Hmm, as long as you don't
scare him away, Your Majesty.

14:53.640 --> 14:55.410
Can't afford to lose
your only ally.

15:11.330 --> 15:12.970
What's all the fuss about?

15:34.140 --> 15:36.820
I wish I had advisers.

15:36.830 --> 15:40.500
When I was a child, my father had
a dozen wise councilmen around him.

15:40.570 --> 15:43.910
I feel small and powerless.

15:43.990 --> 15:46.250
One dragon is more than any flock of
birds, Your Majesty.

15:50.030 --> 15:52.630
Having no council just makes
you all the more powerful.

15:52.700 --> 15:54.380
You answer to no one.

15:54.460 --> 15:56.220
Thank you, Naya.

15:56.300 --> 15:57.500
I'll be sure to fill the room.

15:59.880 --> 16:01.010
Send him in.

16:16.390 --> 16:18.530
Your Majesty.

16:18.540 --> 16:20.860
You're even more dazzling
up close.

16:20.870 --> 16:22.820
Let's cut to it, shall we?

16:22.900 --> 16:25.710
You're here because you support
my claim to the throne,

16:25.790 --> 16:28.880
and when we are victorious,
you want to be rewarded for your loyalty.

16:28.960 --> 16:32.220
What makes you so certain I've
decided to support your claim?

16:32.290 --> 16:35.040
Maybe I'm only here
to size you up,

16:35.050 --> 16:37.960
decide whether
you even have a chance.

16:38.040 --> 16:42.130
Flying a Sovereign flag is a
treasonous act, punishable by death.

16:42.210 --> 16:44.340
You've already made your choice
of who you stand with.

16:44.420 --> 16:47.390
I raised those banners only as we
came into view of this Outpost.

16:47.400 --> 16:50.610
And I gave orders to burn them
as soon as we set camp.

16:50.690 --> 16:54.650
Then pray tell,
what are your intentions?

16:54.720 --> 16:56.910
Or is all this
purely for entertainment?

16:56.980 --> 16:59.150
I'll pledge my army.

16:59.230 --> 17:01.240
I'll pledge my people,
my lands, and my life

17:01.250 --> 17:03.950
to the crown forever...

17:03.960 --> 17:05.329
on one condition.

17:06.819 --> 17:08.750
And what is that?

17:08.829 --> 17:13.000
What I ask...

17:13.079 --> 17:14.089
is that you marry me.

17:34.260 --> 17:36.730
I'm not asking you to love me.

17:36.810 --> 17:38.570
And we only have to share
the same bed

17:38.640 --> 17:41.400
long enough to father a son.

17:41.480 --> 17:44.450
Though I suspect you'd want to
share my bed as much as possible.

17:44.460 --> 17:46.410
I'm told I'm quite...

17:46.480 --> 17:49.130
good in that area.

17:49.200 --> 17:51.450
You will leave
my throne room immediately.

17:51.460 --> 17:52.900
I'm sorry, did I offend
Your Majesty?

17:52.950 --> 17:55.420
I will not be spoken to
in such a vile manner.

17:55.490 --> 17:58.170
Please forgive me for my impertinence,
but allow me to make my case.

18:07.630 --> 18:10.140
To be clear,
I do not want to be king.

18:10.150 --> 18:13.310
I'm not after your power.
I'll merely be your consort.

18:13.320 --> 18:16.900
Do you think that makes your
proposal any less preposterous?

18:16.970 --> 18:18.900
Well, Majesty,
were our fathers still alive,

18:18.910 --> 18:21.280
they'd probably arrange
this marriage themselves

18:21.350 --> 18:24.490
- for the good of the Realm.
- They may have, but they did not.

18:24.500 --> 18:27.820
I alone will decide
who my husband will be.

18:27.830 --> 18:30.660
You and your husband
will decide, presumably.

18:30.670 --> 18:32.870
Of course.

18:32.880 --> 18:35.250
Majesty, I'm not asking you
to give yourself over to me.

18:35.320 --> 18:37.760
You can have many other
lovers, and so will I.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.550
Just as soon
as you bear me a son.

18:43.420 --> 18:45.260
- You want a legacy.
- Yes,

18:45.330 --> 18:47.690
to be a father
to kings and queens.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.850
My bloodline will sit
on the throne for generations,

18:49.860 --> 18:52.310
all leading back to me.

18:52.380 --> 18:55.480
- That's all I want.
- Oh, is that all?

18:55.550 --> 18:59.700
Tell me, Baron Aegisford,
do you play at cards?

18:59.770 --> 19:02.530
Why, yes, of course.
Why do you ask?

19:02.610 --> 19:05.320
Because you've
just tipped your hand.

19:05.400 --> 19:09.540
- I have?
- And reminded me that I am

19:09.620 --> 19:11.880
the only royal remaining.

19:11.950 --> 19:15.330
Therefore my betrothal
is a card to be played.

19:15.410 --> 19:17.880
The top ranking card
in the game.

19:17.960 --> 19:19.880
But if I may extend
your metaphor,

19:19.960 --> 19:23.550
there's only one match
to your card in a deck.

19:23.560 --> 19:25.800
And that's where you're wrong.
We both know

19:25.870 --> 19:28.340
that there are several cards
in a deck that could match.

19:28.420 --> 19:31.180
Some might make
an even more winning hand.

19:31.260 --> 19:33.400
You may go.

19:34.800 --> 19:37.390
Three days.

19:37.400 --> 19:40.770
I'll give you three days
to consider my offer.

19:40.780 --> 19:44.370
And then, you're on your own.

19:47.900 --> 19:48.950
My love.

19:52.830 --> 19:56.250
Now, which one of you gentlemen
is going to escort me

19:56.260 --> 19:58.300
to your finest
drinking establishment?

20:04.410 --> 20:07.380
No! No!

20:07.460 --> 20:09.050
Munt!

20:09.130 --> 20:11.600
Get this vermin out of my face!

20:11.680 --> 20:13.180
Right.

20:13.260 --> 20:14.610
Out you go. Out you go.

20:19.800 --> 20:21.110
Oof.

20:28.600 --> 20:29.600
Elinor.

20:32.320 --> 20:34.630
Has it really been so long?

20:34.700 --> 20:36.630
Well, judging by
how old you look,

20:36.700 --> 20:38.750
it's been at least
that long, Gertie.

20:38.820 --> 20:41.210
I go by Gertrusha.
No one calls me Gertie.

20:41.280 --> 20:45.130
I call you Gertie. I've been calling
you Gertie ever since I could talk.

20:45.140 --> 20:46.750
Auntie Gertie!

20:46.830 --> 20:49.420
Oh, go on, Munt.

20:49.500 --> 20:51.470
Give your Auntie
a lovely big cuddle.

20:51.480 --> 20:56.140
Just make sure you don't break
any of her scrawny old bones.

20:56.150 --> 21:00.770
Aunt Gertrusha. Hello.
Welcome to the Outpost.

21:00.840 --> 21:03.150
Janzo, look at you.

21:03.220 --> 21:07.480
You were just a scamp
when I last saw you.

21:07.490 --> 21:08.900
- What a man you've become.
- Hm.

21:08.980 --> 21:11.650
If he's a man, I'm a virgin.

21:11.660 --> 21:15.040
Janzo, get your Auntie
Gertie a lovely nice drink.

21:15.120 --> 21:17.120
Put it in a clean glass.

21:17.130 --> 21:18.966
Nothing best the best
for her royal daintiness.

21:18.990 --> 21:20.540
No need, Janzo. I can't stay.

21:20.610 --> 21:22.010
I'm Baron Aegisford's counsel.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.760
There's much deliberation
to be done today.

21:23.830 --> 21:27.340
Oh, my own sister,
Baron's counsel.

21:27.350 --> 21:28.750
Who would've thought?

21:28.830 --> 21:30.630
Who did you shag
to get that cushy racket?

21:30.710 --> 21:33.010
I started as
the Baron's governess.

21:33.020 --> 21:35.340
But I counseled his father
for many years

21:35.420 --> 21:37.010
and became his most
trusted adviser.

21:37.020 --> 21:39.510
Oh, so you're
his governess, are you?

21:39.530 --> 21:42.350
More like his nanny.

21:42.360 --> 21:45.310
Elinor, I'm sure
we have much to discuss.

21:45.390 --> 21:48.360
Another time.
At your convenience.

21:48.430 --> 21:50.030
Well, it's convenient now.

21:50.040 --> 21:52.320
Perhaps tomorrow
I'll come for tea?

21:52.400 --> 21:54.530
Whatever you fancy.

21:54.540 --> 21:57.330
Tomorrow for tea then.

22:05.910 --> 22:09.010
Baron's counsel. Wow.

22:16.090 --> 22:17.560
- Janzo?
- Hmm?

22:17.640 --> 22:18.896
You're not going to get
any rest tonight.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.850
I want you to fix this place up.

22:20.920 --> 22:22.850
I want all the tables cleaned.

22:22.930 --> 22:26.070
I want this smell got rid of,
and I want... I want...

22:26.150 --> 22:28.360
I want flowers on every table.

22:28.430 --> 22:30.360
Flower...

22:30.430 --> 22:33.360
Munt, you're coming with me.

22:33.440 --> 22:36.080
Janzo!
Flowers on every table.

22:47.170 --> 22:49.090
Okay, how much we got?

22:49.170 --> 22:50.090
60 brick weights, ma'am.

22:50.100 --> 22:52.430
Just 60?

22:52.510 --> 22:56.380
All right. Sell it to all
the local dealers tonight.

22:56.460 --> 22:58.100
I need gold, and I need it now.

22:58.180 --> 23:01.260
Oh? But the street price
has fallen by more than half.

23:01.270 --> 23:05.020
I don't care. You sell it.

23:06.820 --> 23:09.860
You're looking a bit sharp,
aren't you?

23:09.930 --> 23:12.690
Have you been skimming
off the bank?

23:12.770 --> 23:16.360
No, ma'am. No.

23:16.440 --> 23:18.200
Yes, I bought
just a couple of things,

23:18.270 --> 23:21.070
but it's only because
I'm dealing with distributors

23:21.090 --> 23:23.000
and I got to look nice.

23:25.710 --> 23:30.080
You better not be
skimming off the bank.

23:40.150 --> 23:43.720
This is what my empire is.

23:43.800 --> 23:47.480
Halfwits harvesting fly's eggs
out of bloated corpses

23:47.560 --> 23:50.810
in a sewer, of all places.

23:50.820 --> 23:52.360
We could move it
to the mineshaft.

23:52.430 --> 23:53.940
It's not about moving,
you imbecile.

23:54.020 --> 23:56.410
It's disgusting. Just...

23:57.810 --> 23:59.910
I want to be proud of my work.

23:59.980 --> 24:01.920
I want respect.

24:04.170 --> 24:05.450
People respect you.

24:05.530 --> 24:07.000
Yeah, but not those people.

24:07.080 --> 24:08.910
The people that count.

24:08.990 --> 24:12.080
The people with real power.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.540
But you're rich.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.510
Yeah, but nobody knows that.

24:17.590 --> 24:18.976
That's the problem
with dirty money.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
You can't spend it.

24:27.060 --> 24:28.770
I'm secretly rich,

24:28.840 --> 24:31.600
and that's the same
as being poor.

24:31.680 --> 24:35.150
- It is?
- She's turning up tomorrow,

24:35.230 --> 24:37.586
and I want to show her everything I've
got, everything I'm worth.

24:37.610 --> 24:41.540
And for that, I need bags
and bags of gold.

24:41.620 --> 24:43.950
We'll push on every buyer
in the Outpost,

24:44.030 --> 24:47.330
and every buyer
that passes through.

24:47.400 --> 24:49.000
You'll double your gold.

24:51.630 --> 24:54.260
But won't that turn
a lot more people Plagueling?

24:55.720 --> 24:58.390
- People will die.
- Shut up, Munt.

25:02.390 --> 25:05.850
I feel guilty playing cards
when there's so much to do.

25:05.920 --> 25:09.400
Aren't you supposed to be out
rescuing your translator?

25:09.480 --> 25:11.570
I'm meeting the other
Blackblood at sundown tomorrow.

25:11.650 --> 25:13.850
And what are you going to do?

25:13.930 --> 25:16.990
I haven't decided yet.
She has a demon.

25:17.070 --> 25:18.820
Puts me at a disadvantage.

25:18.890 --> 25:22.070
And you could summon them
without needing the child.

25:22.080 --> 25:26.380
Even if I had the names, I'm not so
sure I could control all of them.

25:28.740 --> 25:32.040
Well, you'll know what to do
when the time comes.

25:32.120 --> 25:35.090
You always do.

25:35.170 --> 25:37.170
I'm not sure I'm meant
to be the one to do it.

25:37.250 --> 25:40.260
What does that mean?

25:40.340 --> 25:43.930
Don't worry. I'll...
I'll work it out.

25:43.940 --> 25:46.220
So, uh, tell me about the
chief of the hill people.

25:46.300 --> 25:49.440
Baron Aegisford.

25:49.520 --> 25:52.020
He's certainly no Garret.

25:52.090 --> 25:55.610
Garret? I mean,
why would you compare the two?

25:55.690 --> 25:58.200
Sorry.

26:00.790 --> 26:03.120
I've traveled most of the Realm.

26:03.200 --> 26:07.200
I've known a lot of men.
Garret was one of a kind.

26:07.280 --> 26:08.790
He loved you, you know?

26:11.320 --> 26:13.750
Well, let's just drop it.

26:13.820 --> 26:15.580
You know, you say
you weren't jealous of me,

26:15.660 --> 26:19.130
but I was certainly
jealous of you.

26:19.140 --> 26:20.710
But love isn't for me.

26:20.790 --> 26:22.550
Men always turn on me
or die on me.

26:22.620 --> 26:24.920
Maybe you just pick
the wrong men.

26:24.940 --> 26:28.140
What about Janzo?

26:29.840 --> 26:31.970
Well, I mean,
you didn't go with Garret

26:31.980 --> 26:33.770
so you could stay to nurse him,

26:33.840 --> 26:35.730
and that says a great deal
about your feelings.

26:35.800 --> 26:40.370
It's Janzo. I mean, I love
him, but not like that.

26:41.900 --> 26:45.160
He certainly
cares deeply for you.

26:45.240 --> 26:48.620
Stop trying
to change the subject.

26:48.690 --> 26:50.830
Tell me about the chief
of the hill people.

26:50.910 --> 26:54.800
Baron Aegisford has asked
for my hand in marriage.

26:57.010 --> 26:58.050
And I assume you said no.

27:00.250 --> 27:02.010
Well, I mean, he is handsome.

27:02.090 --> 27:05.010
Yes.

27:05.020 --> 27:07.390
As far as I can see, that's
about his only good quality.

27:09.430 --> 27:11.360
- So you turned him down?
- Of course.

27:16.270 --> 27:18.440
- Did you let me win?
- No. Why would I let you win?

27:18.510 --> 27:20.280
You're just
as good at Octor as I.

27:38.460 --> 27:42.050
What are you doing
up here, Talon?

27:42.130 --> 27:45.090
- Seems like a good spot
to do some thinking.

27:45.170 --> 27:48.510
I have till sundown to figure out
what I'm going to do about Rebb.

27:48.590 --> 27:51.640
How about we put
some poison in the air?

27:51.650 --> 27:53.560
That would kill
the Dragman, too.

27:53.570 --> 27:58.060
Right, yeah.

27:58.070 --> 28:01.570
Besides, I'm not so sure
I want to kill Rebb.

28:01.650 --> 28:03.490
- She might be right.
- About what?

28:03.570 --> 28:06.150
About everything.

28:06.230 --> 28:07.740
Janzo!

28:23.410 --> 28:25.630
Something strong.

28:25.710 --> 28:28.100
You certainly are.

28:28.180 --> 28:29.880
- Janzo!
- Mm.

28:29.960 --> 28:33.850
Get this gentleman here
a stiff one.

28:36.020 --> 28:39.610
You must be my sister's
handsome baron.

28:39.690 --> 28:42.940
That I am.
So that means you're Elinor.

28:43.010 --> 28:44.860
That I am.

28:44.930 --> 28:49.530
I see you're even more
ravishing than Gertrusha.

28:49.600 --> 28:53.670
And I can see you're
even more full of dung.

28:53.740 --> 28:55.670
Let me know if
you need anything.

29:16.130 --> 29:19.320
Who knew there were so many pretty
ladies in this gods-forsaken town, eh?

29:25.400 --> 29:27.820
- Allow me to introduce my...
- I know who you are.

29:30.070 --> 29:33.500
So, how was your audience
with the queen?

29:33.570 --> 29:36.000
She's a firebrand,
I'll say that.

29:36.080 --> 29:38.340
Too much woman for you?

29:38.410 --> 29:40.840
I thought you were a warrior.

29:40.910 --> 29:42.340
I don't want to brag,

29:42.420 --> 29:44.830
but I could knock down
any man in this Outpost.

29:44.840 --> 29:47.250
Perhaps.

29:47.330 --> 29:49.170
But what about a woman?

29:49.180 --> 29:51.520
I'll get us a room.

29:53.470 --> 29:55.186
I was challenging you
to a fight, you idiot.

29:55.210 --> 29:56.590
You were?

29:56.670 --> 29:58.010
I like to test my skills
on rude men

29:58.020 --> 30:00.610
who think they're better
than everyone else.

30:04.850 --> 30:06.700
- Never got your name.
- Never gave it to you.

30:08.530 --> 30:10.110
So you up for the challenge?

30:10.180 --> 30:14.200
Mmm. Good ale, barkeep!

30:14.210 --> 30:18.210
I'm a brewer.
What challenge?

30:18.290 --> 30:19.830
Sparring with that sweet thing.

30:19.900 --> 30:22.370
Sweet thing?
This is going to be fun.

30:22.380 --> 30:24.620
Hey.

30:24.700 --> 30:26.556
She's going to pound that
pretty little face of yours

30:26.580 --> 30:28.210
until you look like a Greyskin.

30:28.220 --> 30:29.840
Sorry, Janzo.

30:29.910 --> 30:32.100
This is one strange town.

30:39.710 --> 30:42.390
So, how was your card game
with Talon?

30:42.400 --> 30:44.060
It was good, thank you,

30:44.070 --> 30:46.020
although I do feel
for the poor girl.

30:46.100 --> 30:47.650
Why?

30:47.720 --> 30:50.820
Well, I feel she needs
a love in her life.

30:50.890 --> 30:53.070
- Someone she can count on.
- Don't we all?

30:53.140 --> 30:57.410
- Mm.
- You have someone in mind, don't you?

30:57.420 --> 31:00.160
Brewer. He's clearly
in love with her.

31:00.230 --> 31:03.670
- Janzo? Really?
- What? Why not?

31:03.750 --> 31:05.960
I mean, he's already
proven himself.

31:06.030 --> 31:09.080
He's already in her life.
He just... he needs help.

31:09.090 --> 31:11.460
I'd say he's a walking disaster.

31:11.540 --> 31:14.380
I want you to guide him.

31:14.460 --> 31:16.850
- Me?
- Make him into the man

31:16.930 --> 31:19.390
- that Talon needs in her life.
- What if he refuses my help?

31:19.460 --> 31:20.640
Just say that you're doing it

31:20.710 --> 31:22.106
to make Talon
fall in love with him.

31:22.130 --> 31:23.130
- But...
- He wants that.

31:23.180 --> 31:24.270
That may be impossible.

31:24.350 --> 31:27.230
I command you to do it.

31:27.240 --> 31:29.610
Fix him.

31:29.690 --> 31:32.370
Fix him.
Yes, your majesty.

31:37.700 --> 31:40.240
Three drops.
That should do it.

31:40.320 --> 31:42.120
Hmm.

31:42.130 --> 31:44.120
Skyweed milk.

31:44.130 --> 31:47.620
No immediate effect
on larval gestation.

31:47.630 --> 31:52.540
Smell, mm. Ha-ha.
Smells like...

31:52.620 --> 31:55.810
Talon's hair, actually.

31:55.880 --> 31:57.520
Ahem.

31:57.590 --> 31:59.550
That time I was
sneaking up on you.

31:59.630 --> 32:02.600
Naya, please tell Gwynn
I'm working as fast as I can.

32:02.670 --> 32:04.430
Oh, um, she didn't
send me for that.

32:04.510 --> 32:07.640
- What, then?
- Well, um,

32:07.720 --> 32:09.980
the Queen has observed
that you and Talon

32:10.050 --> 32:10.980
have feelings for each other.

32:10.990 --> 32:12.610
What?

32:12.680 --> 32:15.230
And she wants me to help
prod the relationship along.

32:15.310 --> 32:17.650
Relationship?
No, Talon and I are just friends.

32:17.660 --> 32:20.990
But you could be more if we,
um, fix you up a bit.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.990
- Fix me up?
- Yes. We can start with the hair.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.870
I don't need fixing, thank you.

32:25.950 --> 32:27.830
And why on earth would the
Queen care about the nature

32:27.840 --> 32:29.006
of Talon and mine's friendship?

32:29.030 --> 32:30.460
You're both
very important to her,

32:30.530 --> 32:31.556
and she wants you to be happy.

32:31.580 --> 32:34.170
That's very nice, but I am...

32:34.180 --> 32:35.750
I am happy.

32:35.830 --> 32:38.420
Look, I don't like this
anymore than you do,

32:38.500 --> 32:40.680
but the Queen has commanded it,

32:40.690 --> 32:42.180
and I know just the look
that would suit you.

32:42.190 --> 32:45.190
The way I look is just fine.

32:45.270 --> 32:47.470
Trust me, you'll like it.

32:47.480 --> 32:49.530
Besides, what's the harm, hmm?

32:49.600 --> 32:52.980
A new appearance certainly won't
make Talon like you any less.

32:53.060 --> 32:54.700
Hmm?

32:54.770 --> 32:55.770
Hmm.

32:57.890 --> 33:01.370
- I look like a jerk.
- You look dashing.

33:01.450 --> 33:03.336
I deal with jerks at
the Night Shade all the time,

33:03.360 --> 33:04.530
and this man right here,

33:04.540 --> 33:06.280
this one is not to be trusted.

33:06.360 --> 33:07.540
But women love that.

33:07.550 --> 33:09.550
Women love a man
they can't trust?

33:09.620 --> 33:11.960
They love men
with a little danger.

33:12.030 --> 33:14.750
Act assertive, confident,
and that's half the battle.

33:14.830 --> 33:18.800
And... stand up straight.

33:18.870 --> 33:20.720
- Now I feel like a fool.
- No, you don't.

33:20.800 --> 33:22.890
Talon is going to faint
when she sees you.

33:33.240 --> 33:34.520
Take this to the back, Munt.

33:34.600 --> 33:36.230
All right.

33:36.240 --> 33:38.480
Aah!

33:38.560 --> 33:40.330
Something catch your eye?

33:44.750 --> 33:46.250
Thank you.

33:51.330 --> 33:52.420
Hey, barkeep.

33:54.410 --> 33:57.300
- I'm a brewer.
- I can't decide.

33:57.380 --> 33:59.600
Who do you think
is more beautiful?

33:59.670 --> 34:03.670
The Queen or her handmaid?

34:03.750 --> 34:08.889
Listen, honey,
when I've married our Queen,

34:08.969 --> 34:11.600
you and I can play
whenever she's not around, eh?

34:11.610 --> 34:13.560
Her Majesty is not to be
joked about.

34:13.639 --> 34:15.600
Everything is to be joked about.

34:15.679 --> 34:17.940
Have you heard this one?

34:18.020 --> 34:19.900
A barkeeper
and a Queen's handmaid

34:19.980 --> 34:22.900
stumble out of
a tavern cellar together.

34:22.980 --> 34:26.790
The handmaid stands behind
the barkeeper and rubs his back

34:26.870 --> 34:30.370
while he pours a drink.
And the barkeepers says?

34:30.440 --> 34:32.560
She was interested in my research, okay?
Nothing else.

34:33.580 --> 34:35.250
Stop laughing.
Stop laughing!

34:35.320 --> 34:37.460
There's nothing funny about
what was going on downstairs.

34:37.469 --> 34:40.469
When I am king,
you can be my court jester.

34:40.550 --> 34:43.260
Look... when he becomes king?

34:43.330 --> 34:45.270
Naya, what's he talking about?

34:46.389 --> 34:47.600
Another refill out back.

35:00.350 --> 35:02.410
- I think she liked it.
- Really?

35:05.310 --> 35:07.240
Whispering sweet nothings
in his ear?

35:07.250 --> 35:08.670
I'll take those.

35:10.900 --> 35:11.900
Oh, hello.

35:13.670 --> 35:15.000
Hey! Hey!

35:19.750 --> 35:21.000
Janzo!

35:21.010 --> 35:23.590
Come on, I barely hit
the smelly pig.

35:23.660 --> 35:25.850
Janzo? Oh, Janzo.

35:25.930 --> 35:27.840
I dare you to open
your big mouth.

35:27.920 --> 35:30.600
Take it easy.
I'm not going to hit a woman...

35:30.610 --> 35:32.600
No matter how beautiful she is.

35:32.670 --> 35:34.850
I mean, seriously,

35:34.860 --> 35:36.680
the women in this town,

35:36.700 --> 35:40.270
it's like
the better-looking they are,

35:40.350 --> 35:41.810
the crazier they are.

35:41.890 --> 35:43.910
I'm going to hit you now.

35:46.730 --> 35:50.170
Like I said,
I don't fight women.

35:54.900 --> 35:56.300
Okay.

36:07.210 --> 36:09.010
Go on. Get up.

36:09.090 --> 36:12.900
No, I think I'll stay here
and catch my breath.

36:14.400 --> 36:16.180
You're smarter than you look.

36:32.990 --> 36:35.590
What did you go and do that for?

36:35.660 --> 36:37.750
Naya said it made me
look more attractive.

36:37.830 --> 36:40.670
Not your hair.

36:40.740 --> 36:42.380
Why'd you pick a fight
with that idiot?

36:42.450 --> 36:44.840
Same reason really.

36:44.910 --> 36:47.210
Naya said, "You have to be
more assertive, Janzo."

36:47.290 --> 36:49.340
You need to stop
listening to Naya.

36:49.420 --> 36:51.090
She's gonna get you killed.

36:51.100 --> 36:53.340
Coming from the woman
who takes me out to fight

36:53.420 --> 36:55.100
demons and Greyskins
and Plaguelings?

37:00.190 --> 37:03.060
Speaking of which,
it's almost nightfall.

37:03.140 --> 37:06.270
Have you figured out a way
to get the Dragman back yet?

37:06.280 --> 37:09.900
Yes. I decided
I'm giving Rebb the Asterkinj.

37:09.980 --> 37:13.620
What? Talon,
why on earth would you do that?

37:13.700 --> 37:16.950
We can find another way.
You've still got time, huh?

37:16.960 --> 37:18.756
The smith thought I was the
one to fulfill the prophecy

37:18.780 --> 37:20.710
because I was the only
Blackblood left.

37:20.780 --> 37:24.210
But he was wrong.

37:24.290 --> 37:25.880
There's a new one now,

37:25.950 --> 37:28.510
one with pure blood.

37:29.970 --> 37:31.720
Well, if it's not you,
then quite frankly,

37:31.790 --> 37:34.140
the prophecy sounds
terrifyingly bad.

37:34.220 --> 37:38.150
"To summon the slayers of men"?

37:38.220 --> 37:41.430
Talon, that means to kill me
and to kill Gwynn

37:41.510 --> 37:42.150
and to kill everyone you know.

37:42.230 --> 37:44.650
"Summon the slayers."

37:44.730 --> 37:47.690
That doesn't mean kill.
I can convince her not to.

37:47.770 --> 37:50.280
Are you really that naive?

37:50.290 --> 37:51.820
She's going to say
whatever she has to

37:51.830 --> 37:53.820
to get that thing out
of your head.

37:53.830 --> 37:56.070
She's a Blackblood, Janzo.

37:56.150 --> 37:57.150
She's just like me.

38:00.250 --> 38:01.930
And there are many more
through the portal.

38:01.990 --> 38:03.880
What am I supposed to do?
Just leave them there?

38:06.200 --> 38:08.000
What about...

38:08.010 --> 38:10.000
What about your promise
to Gwynn?

38:13.760 --> 38:15.230
I can't control a demon army.

38:17.520 --> 38:18.690
Rebb and her Blackbloods can.

38:22.600 --> 38:24.810
You're making a huge mistake.

38:24.890 --> 38:28.020
Yeah, well, it's
my mistake to make, right?

38:28.100 --> 38:30.780
At sundown,
I'm going out to meet Rebb.

38:30.850 --> 38:33.770
I'm giving her the Asterkinj and I'm
helping her bring our people through.

39:12.240 --> 39:13.990
Where's my boy?

40:08.300 --> 40:09.840
Is my boy alive?

40:13.380 --> 40:14.550
Garret?

40:19.960 --> 40:21.560
Garret!
