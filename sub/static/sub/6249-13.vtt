WEBVTT

00:02.053 --> 00:04.328
Bones, you are not gonna believe this one.

00:04.413 --> 00:08.007
You said that about the guy
who was stuffed inside a huge truck tyre.

00:08.093 --> 00:12.848
Yeah, that was a good one.
But this is a whole new level of weird.

00:15.973 --> 00:19.329
- Whoa. I don't believe it.
- What'd I tell you?

00:19.413 --> 00:21.449
How could this happen?

00:21.533 --> 00:24.445
Well, maybe he was rolled up in a carpet.

00:25.533 --> 00:29.606
- Where's the carpet?
- It rotted away, with the meaty parts.

00:31.933 --> 00:34.288
What? It's possible.

00:35.573 --> 00:39.885
That would've taken
thousands of years.

00:40.253 --> 00:41.925
Um...

00:42.013 --> 00:48.009
The bones should be in a pile...
but something is holding them together and...

00:48.613 --> 00:50.410
What is with you?

00:50.493 --> 00:54.042
"Rolled in a carpet..." "Meaty parts..."

00:54.133 --> 00:58.285
Excuse me.

00:58.373 --> 01:00.523
- What is so funny?
- Nothing.

01:00.613 --> 01:04.845
I should hope not, because there's a dead
body deserving of respect in front of you.

01:04.933 --> 01:07.322
What happened to him?

01:08.373 --> 01:11.683
- I did not know she could laugh.
- Why are you at the crime scene?

01:11.773 --> 01:15.322
Dr Brennan is suspended
from all crime-related duties.

01:15.413 --> 01:17.210
- What?
- For laughing at Booth?

01:17.293 --> 01:21.172
- That doesn't bother me.
- We have a date for your father's murder trial.

01:21.253 --> 01:24.370
Booth is the arresting officer.
You can't work together.

01:24.453 --> 01:27.047
- This is not necessary.
- No need to separate us.

01:27.133 --> 01:29.693
- I'm very compartmentalised.
- Very.

01:29.773 --> 01:32.571
Take it up with the FBI, <i>chéri.</i>

01:37.013 --> 01:39.163
Well, that sucks.

01:40.853 --> 01:45.005
- This one looked really interesting.
- Yeah. Really, really interesting.

01:45.373 --> 01:50.288
- I'll let you know what happens.
- You're not gonna solve it without me.

01:55.373 --> 01:58.809
There's no use in doing partners therapy
when we aren't partners.

01:58.893 --> 02:01.407
- What? You split up?
- No, we <i>got</i> split up.

02:01.493 --> 02:03.802
- The FBI says we can't work together.
- Why?

02:03.893 --> 02:07.203
- Her dad murdered the deputy director.
- His trial is next week.

02:07.293 --> 02:09.363
- I should've been informed.
- Why?

02:09.453 --> 02:14.243
- Sweets did the psychological profile on Max.
- What? Why didn't you tell me?

02:14.333 --> 02:18.167
- Why is that important to you?
- Sweets, no therapy. Didn't I just?

02:18.253 --> 02:23.486
Because, while it would matter to, say,
a normal person, I figured you wouldn't care.

02:23.573 --> 02:24.801
You're right.

02:24.893 --> 02:27.691
Everyone you work with,
including your therapist...

02:27.773 --> 02:29.252
Former therapist.

02:29.333 --> 02:33.531
...is endeavouring to imprison your father.
That's wicked stressful.

02:33.613 --> 02:36.889
- Booth is right. It doesn't bother me.
- Booth is wrong. It does.

02:36.973 --> 02:39.612
May I suggest
that this is a golden opportunity

02:39.693 --> 02:42.685
for you to feel a situation
rather than rationalise it?

02:42.773 --> 02:43.762
I'm fine.

02:43.853 --> 02:47.323
If you were fine, you'd be in the corner
weeping or semi-catatonic.

02:47.413 --> 02:50.166
- Does that sound fine to you?
- I'm with Sweets on this.

02:50.253 --> 02:52.323
It's important
that you know that <i>we</i> know

02:52.413 --> 02:56.372
that the colder and more objective
you appear on the outside,

02:56.453 --> 02:58.762
the more pain you're feeling on the inside.

02:58.853 --> 03:01.128
- I'm fine.
- No, you're not.

03:01.213 --> 03:05.525
Well, Sweets, I'm gonna miss you.
It was really a pleasure working with you.

03:05.613 --> 03:06.807
Really? You are?

03:06.893 --> 03:12.604
I, too, find him intriguing - in a non-rigorous,
pragmatically irrelevant kind of way.

03:12.693 --> 03:15.491
- Thank you for trying to help us.
- Thanks, Sweets.

03:15.573 --> 03:18.610
You're welcome.
But honestly, guys, we can...

03:18.693 --> 03:22.402
- Will you pick this up? The tab?
- Yeah, sure. We can keep working...

03:24.453 --> 03:28.605
Lame. I thought I was doing a good job.

03:30.000 --> 03:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:59.453 --> 04:03.924
No offence, but I'd feel better if the famous
Dr Brennan was my scientific mouthpiece.

04:04.013 --> 04:07.005
- Have you done this before?
- It's not Clark's first trial.

04:07.093 --> 04:09.243
Oh, he's a full-grown scientist?

04:09.333 --> 04:13.451
I shave, sir. I have a driver's licence.
I've won a couple of fistfights.

04:13.533 --> 04:15.728
I've saved a life.
I've lain with a woman.

04:15.813 --> 04:20.091
I've been hustled, defied my father's wishes,
broken hearts and been heartbroken.

04:20.173 --> 04:24.246
So by all the markers of this society,
I am a grown man.

04:25.893 --> 04:27.770
Wow.

04:27.853 --> 04:31.004
- You've lain with a woman?
- Will he talk like that at Dad's trial?

04:31.093 --> 04:34.085
Listen, Max, we could have Clark
list his qualifications,

04:34.173 --> 04:36.403
but that'll spoil the surprise in court.

04:36.493 --> 04:40.008
Clark is the last forensic anthropologist
I'd want to be up against.

04:40.093 --> 04:43.688
- What about that genius kid?
- The oversized eyes and toaster head?

04:43.773 --> 04:46.606
Sorry if my normal head and eyes
diminish your confidence.

04:46.693 --> 04:48.888
Zack is working for the prosecution.

04:53.773 --> 04:55.968
OK. Welcome on board, kid.

04:56.053 --> 04:58.487
- Dad...
- Thank you.

04:59.133 --> 05:01.488
Are you seriously
squeezing my hand that hard?

05:01.573 --> 05:04.087
Give Clark his hand back, Dad.

05:06.493 --> 05:08.131
Nice.

05:09.133 --> 05:10.885
We'll wait outside, Tempe.

05:12.053 --> 05:14.965
I still wish you were gonna be my scientist.

05:15.733 --> 05:17.530
Here.

05:19.613 --> 05:22.764
You should wear this tie
in the courtroom.

05:23.613 --> 05:25.649
Oh, but it's a grey tie.

05:25.733 --> 05:30.124
Apparently the colour grey tells the jury
you are a serious man with good judgement.

05:30.213 --> 05:32.681
Yeah, or that I'm drab.

05:34.813 --> 05:37.725
- I can't stop this from happening.
- What do you mean?

05:37.813 --> 05:42.204
Booth, Hodgins, Zack, Angela, Caroline -
they're all my friends, but I can't...

05:42.293 --> 05:45.171
Listen. I know you love me. All right?

05:47.093 --> 05:49.527
I can see it, even if nobody else can.

05:49.613 --> 05:52.923
So that's something
you don't have to worry about.

06:08.973 --> 06:11.089
I'll wear the tie.

06:16.013 --> 06:20.882
- I hate this. I hate it.
- What? Strangers on our forensic platform?

06:20.973 --> 06:25.125
- That we're on different sides.
- All of us together and Brennan alone.

06:25.213 --> 06:29.092
Not alone.
She's with those African-American people.

06:29.173 --> 06:30.731
This is not a competition.

06:30.813 --> 06:34.772
The reason they call the justice system
adversarial is that it is competitive.

06:34.853 --> 06:40.052
No, it's not a competition between us and
Brennan. This is just an unfortunate situation.

06:40.133 --> 06:42.931
Yeah. Yeah, it's an unfortunate situation.

06:43.013 --> 06:46.289
If Brennan understands
we aren't crazily competitive about it,

06:46.373 --> 06:49.206
we'll come through this
with our friendships intact.

06:49.293 --> 06:53.809
Besides, Dr Brennan must realise
that we're going to destroy them.

06:53.893 --> 06:58.364
I'll explain "crazily competitive" to Zack
over and over again until he gets it.

06:59.173 --> 07:04.531
OK. Prosecution briefing in 20,
and Caroline does not tolerate tardiness.

07:05.333 --> 07:10.453
Well, I've reviewed all the physical evidence
compiled by Dr Addy and the prosecution.

07:10.533 --> 07:12.171
What do you think?

07:12.253 --> 07:15.802
They are always judgement calls,
but it holds together.

07:15.893 --> 07:19.329
I may feel better about our position
once I do my own examination.

07:19.413 --> 07:23.486
What occurs to you when you look at
the x-rays and skeletal remains of the victim?

07:23.573 --> 07:27.202
- The killer was merciful.
- That is completely unscientific.

07:27.293 --> 07:31.650
The victim was stabbed several times,
set on fire and gutted. Where's the mercy?

07:32.173 --> 07:36.769
Death was instantaneous. A single blow
to the mastoid process. Zero pain.

07:36.853 --> 07:39.765
Guts, stabs, burns -
all that occurred postmortem.

07:39.853 --> 07:42.651
- Mercy.
- Zack will be the more precise expert witness.

07:42.733 --> 07:45.088
Clark will be the more persuasive.

07:45.173 --> 07:48.131
In prosecution,
objectivity is seen as a virtue.

07:48.213 --> 07:53.128
- In defence, we humanise the accused.
- I accept your logic.

07:53.213 --> 07:56.523
I'm gonna put some effort
into making Dr Addy look bad.

07:56.613 --> 07:59.411
I'd appreciate it
if the jury didn't see you doubt me.

07:59.493 --> 08:02.053
That will be difficult
because my father is guilty.

08:02.133 --> 08:06.251
Dr Brennan, I need that to be the last time
you speak those thoughts aloud.

08:06.333 --> 08:10.042
- Why?
- What we think about that is irrelevant.

08:10.133 --> 08:15.810
It's their job to prove your father's guilty
beyond a shadow of a doubt.

08:16.653 --> 08:19.963
- How long do you need with the skeleton?
- As much time as I can get.

08:20.053 --> 08:23.807
- I'd also like to look at your case files.
- Why?

08:23.893 --> 08:28.409
Because you taught Dr Addy.
I'd like to get a feel for who I'm up against.

08:33.293 --> 08:35.760
I'm gonna say
what I always say before a trial,

08:35.852 --> 08:38.765
because this one is no different
than any other trial.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.844
- You never said that before.
- What?

08:40.933 --> 08:44.972
- That a trial is no different from any other.
- Suggesting this one <i>is</i> different.

08:45.053 --> 08:47.567
- Have you no control over them?
- None whatsoever.

08:47.653 --> 08:51.362
Look, Caroline, it's Bones.
It's different. Let's just admit that.

08:51.453 --> 08:54.729
Here's what's not different.
Lose the "cocky" belt buckle.

08:54.813 --> 08:58.044
No badges saying "Resist authority"
or "The truth is out there".

08:58.133 --> 09:01.728
Do not cut your own hair
the day before a trial.

09:01.813 --> 09:04.805
Ugly up a little.
The plain women on the jury hate you.

09:04.893 --> 09:07.566
Use your fully grown-up words.

09:07.653 --> 09:11.009
Eat. Last time your stomach growled
louder than your testimony.

09:11.093 --> 09:13.891
Then don't put me on
first thing in the morning.

09:13.973 --> 09:17.602
I assure you I will be totally,
awesomely mature on the stand.

09:17.693 --> 09:20.491
Miss Julian, I'm not taking the stand.

09:22.373 --> 09:23.408
You have to.

09:23.493 --> 09:29.250
Look, I'm not gonna tell anybody else
what to do here, but I'm not testifying.

09:29.773 --> 09:31.968
Booth?

09:32.053 --> 09:35.807
Right. OK, listen up, people.
Bones, she believes in the system.

09:35.893 --> 09:38.771
She finds out Angela's not testifying,
she won't like it.

09:38.853 --> 09:41.651
She'd want all of us to do our jobs.

09:41.733 --> 09:46.329
Dr Brennan does seem to have an enviable,
if disturbing, ability to compartmentalise.

09:46.413 --> 09:49.211
Hey, how's that for a fully grown-up vocab?

09:49.293 --> 09:52.251
Clean and detached.
Just the way Dr Brennan likes it.

09:52.333 --> 09:55.166
- I have no problem.
- I'll ask Dr Brennan directly.

09:55.253 --> 09:57.892
If she says OK, then I'm on board.

09:57.973 --> 10:01.283
- See you all in court.
- Listen, Caroline, when I'm testifying,

10:01.373 --> 10:03.967
the jury won't see my belt buckle
cos it's below...

10:04.053 --> 10:09.127
- This briefing is over, <i>chéri.</i>
- See, when I stand, the tie covers...

10:11.493 --> 10:15.088
I am Judge Marcus Haddoes.
This is my court.

10:15.173 --> 10:18.290
When you swear to God to tell the truth,
you look at <i>my</i> face.

10:18.373 --> 10:21.285
Because in this courtroom
I may not actually be God,

10:21.373 --> 10:23.603
but I sure as hell am the next best thing.

10:23.693 --> 10:27.481
You people watching,
at heart I am a shy man.

10:28.773 --> 10:34.006
So I would be perfectly happy to kick
all of you out given the slightest excuse.

10:35.133 --> 10:37.567
Miss Julian, opening statement.

10:37.653 --> 10:41.441
I'm the prosecutor in this trial
and it's my job to prove to you

10:41.533 --> 10:45.970
that Max Keenan murdered
FBI Deputy Director Robert Kirby.

10:46.053 --> 10:49.602
My client had motive to kill the victim.

10:49.693 --> 10:53.891
Motive, means, and opportunity -
like many, many others.

10:53.973 --> 10:57.283
Deputy Director Kirby
was a bad piece of work,

10:57.373 --> 10:59.648
corrupt, a cold-blooded killer.

10:59.733 --> 11:03.328
He had many, many enemies
who wanted him dead.

11:03.413 --> 11:08.282
They'll say that Kirby intended
to murder Max Keenan and his family -

11:08.373 --> 11:12.161
that's them there, that beautiful
young woman, that fine young man -

11:12.253 --> 11:15.848
putting the concept of self-defence
into your head.

11:15.933 --> 11:20.529
The prosecution will produce
no eyewitness and no proof

11:20.613 --> 11:24.970
beyond circumstantial conjecture
and trace evidence.

11:25.053 --> 11:29.808
Dr Temperance Brennan here is one of the
finest forensic anthropologists in the country.

11:29.893 --> 11:33.932
She's renowned for her integrity,
for her professional reputation.

11:34.013 --> 11:36.163
She's also the defendant's daughter.

11:36.253 --> 11:39.325
Dr Brennan won't testify
on behalf of her father

11:39.413 --> 11:44.089
because you, the jury, simply will not believe
that a loving daughter can be objective.

11:44.173 --> 11:45.845
- That's all.
- Booth.

11:45.933 --> 11:49.243
- I could so be objective.
- I know, Bones, OK? Just shh.

11:49.333 --> 11:52.006
...what the prosecution called
"a bad piece of work".

11:52.093 --> 11:58.282
That charming man slit Robert Kirby's throat,
gutted him and set him on fire.

11:58.373 --> 12:00.170
We'll prove that to you.

12:00.253 --> 12:06.044
Miss Julian and I may disagree
on many facets of this case.

12:06.133 --> 12:10.092
But I do agree with her
the accused is a very nice guy.

12:10.173 --> 12:13.085
Point of clarification.
I said "charming", not "nice".

12:13.173 --> 12:18.486
This is exactly the kind of nonsense
I want to avoid. And you two, please?

12:18.573 --> 12:21.087
Keep to your own sides of the aisle.

12:21.173 --> 12:22.322
All rise.

12:22.413 --> 12:26.167
Get a cup of coffee. We hear
first prosecution witness in 20 minutes.

12:32.333 --> 12:35.928
Might not be good coffee,
but hey, at least it's lukewarm.

12:36.013 --> 12:38.368
- We can't talk.
-  About the case.

12:38.453 --> 12:41.604
But we can talk about crappy coffee.

12:41.693 --> 12:45.322
Put the cup in front of your mouth
when you talk.

12:45.413 --> 12:48.803
- I didn't see Angela today.
- Angela refuses to testify.

12:48.893 --> 12:52.442
- Why?
- Probably because she's your best friend.

12:52.533 --> 12:57.323
- <i>You're</i> my friend and <i>you</i> don't mind.
- I mind. We all mind. Except for Zack.

12:57.413 --> 12:59.881
Then Zack is the only one thinking clearly.

12:59.973 --> 13:03.443
I had to give Hodgins permission.
What's wrong with everyone?

13:03.533 --> 13:07.412
It's not what's wrong, Bones.
It's what's right.

13:09.693 --> 13:11.490
No, no. Y'all cut that out.

13:11.573 --> 13:14.690
Court will reconvene in 30 seconds.

13:14.773 --> 13:16.365
Good luck, Bones.

13:16.453 --> 13:22.244
Oh, and remember, I'm the one
who gave you this delicious coffee.

13:22.333 --> 13:23.402
Why?

13:23.493 --> 13:28.521
Because I'm the first prosecution witness
against your father.

13:30.293 --> 13:35.731
Dr Brennan and I entered her apartment
and we found a large pool of blood.

13:36.933 --> 13:39.891
You were concerned
with Russ Brennan's life at this point?

13:39.973 --> 13:41.122
That's correct.

13:41.213 --> 13:43.966
- You thought the blood was Russ Brennan's?
- Correct.

13:44.053 --> 13:45.930
And whose blood did it prove to be?

13:46.013 --> 13:49.164
DNA analysis proved the blood
was Deputy Director Kirby's.

13:49.253 --> 13:51.483
A sharp instrument was inserted here,

13:51.573 --> 13:55.566
puncturing the sternocleidomastoid
and cutting the carotid artery.

13:56.093 --> 14:00.450
It entered just behind the ear, nicked
the mastoid, went through the oropharynx

14:00.533 --> 14:02.808
and terminated
at the opposite mandible.

14:02.893 --> 14:07.330
To create a blood puddle this large, the body
would have to lay for three to five minutes.

14:07.413 --> 14:08.607
Three to five minutes?

14:08.693 --> 14:12.003
About the time it takes
to roll the body up in a shower curtain.

14:12.093 --> 14:14.607
How do we know the copper pipe
is the murder weapon?

14:14.693 --> 14:19.369
These are very, very small traces of copper
left in the mylohyoid line of the mandible.

14:19.453 --> 14:23.924
- And what is the copper pipe made of?
- As with most copper pipes, copper.

14:24.013 --> 14:27.005
Does any evidence
tie the defendant to the murder scene?

14:27.093 --> 14:29.891
I found particles of the same soil
at the murder scene,

14:29.973 --> 14:33.727
at the rooftop where the body was burned,
and at Our Lady of Angels seminary.

14:33.813 --> 14:38.409
Someone transferred those particles from the
seminary to the murder scene to the rooftop.

14:38.493 --> 14:41.530
- Who could've done that?
- The defendant was at the seminary.

14:41.613 --> 14:44.332
- Are you certain?
- Yeah. I saw him there myself.

14:44.413 --> 14:46.802
What was he doing there?

14:53.173 --> 14:55.687
He was impersonating a priest.

14:59.853 --> 15:02.925
And you're 100% positive
this is the murder weapon?

15:03.013 --> 15:05.527
I'm not comfortable with 100% .

15:05.613 --> 15:09.572
You're convinced beyond a reasonable doubt
that this is the murder weapon?

15:09.653 --> 15:10.927
Yes, I am.

15:11.013 --> 15:14.722
And is there any evidence at all
tying the defendant to this weapon?

15:14.813 --> 15:21.412
In 1966, Max Keenan was sent to Cook County
Jail for robbery. He was attacked.

15:22.093 --> 15:24.129
Did he defend himself?

15:25.373 --> 15:27.409
Yes.

15:28.093 --> 15:30.971
Did he defend himself with this?

15:32.413 --> 15:34.085
- Yes.
- Successfully?

15:34.173 --> 15:38.007
- I just poked them to keep them away.
-  Yes.

15:38.093 --> 15:42.564
- What was the result of that attack?
- Well, no one bothered Max again.

15:42.653 --> 15:46.282
- Anything else?
- He had eight months added to his sentence.

15:46.373 --> 15:49.285
Anything else, Agent Booth?

15:50.573 --> 15:53.565
A sharpened pipe
kind of became a trademark for him.

15:55.693 --> 15:58.366
Where was this weapon found?

16:00.133 --> 16:02.283
Right here, in this pile of ashes.

16:02.373 --> 16:04.807
What exactly is that pile of ashes?

16:04.893 --> 16:08.966
It turned out to be the victim's intestines.
The abdomen had been slashed open.

16:09.053 --> 16:13.729
And with the body so badly burned,
intestines reduced to ashes,

16:13.813 --> 16:18.170
how did you identify the remains
as those of Deputy Director Kirby?

16:18.253 --> 16:22.132
- I've got nothing to say.
- You're under oath as a material witness.

16:22.213 --> 16:26.206
I swore to tell the truth.
And the truth is that I am not saying anything.

16:26.293 --> 16:28.124
Judge Haddoes?

16:28.213 --> 16:30.852
- The witness will answer.
- No. The witness will not.

16:30.933 --> 16:33.049
- Angela, answer!
- Silence, please.

16:33.133 --> 16:36.045
The witness will answer
or I will find her in contempt.

16:36.133 --> 16:39.728
- Any way I can talk you out of that?
- Why call a witness who won't answer?

16:39.813 --> 16:43.522
I figured once she saw your scary face,
she'd rethink her options.

16:43.613 --> 16:47.242
- I'm taking the Fifth.
- <i>Chérie,</i> that refers to the Fifth Amendment,

16:47.333 --> 16:51.645
which protects you
from being forced to incriminate <i>yourself.</i>

16:51.733 --> 16:57.285
OK. All right. Well, the First Amendment
protects freedom of association, right?

16:57.373 --> 17:01.048
Which means that it protects friendship.
So I'm taking the First.

17:01.133 --> 17:06.127
- Which is even better than taking the Fifth.
- There is no friendship at a homicide trial.

17:06.213 --> 17:10.126
This is the Federal District Court
for the District of Columbia, USA.

17:10.213 --> 17:13.887
When this asks you a question, you answer,
or you pay the ferryman.

17:13.973 --> 17:16.726
- It ain't gonna happen.
- Angie, they aren't kidding.

17:16.813 --> 17:18.963
- Bones, now's the time to speak up.
- What?

17:19.053 --> 17:21.567
He's the ferryman.
The judge is the ferryman.

17:21.653 --> 17:24.247
Ange, just so you know, he's the ferryman!

17:24.333 --> 17:26.642
I will clear this court
if I hear another word!

17:26.733 --> 17:29.611
- Thanks a lot.
- I find this witness in contempt.

17:29.693 --> 17:35.086
She will be incarcerated until she answers
the question posed to her by the People.

17:39.573 --> 17:41.928
- Angela, please!
- Sit down.

17:42.013 --> 17:45.847
Sweetie, this is one of those times
when I know what's right

17:45.933 --> 17:49.289
and everybody else is confused.

18:01.813 --> 18:06.568
I mean, shouldn't you be objecting a little
more? Asking for sidebars? More like that?

18:06.653 --> 18:08.530
The jury looks at Dad kinda mean.

18:08.613 --> 18:12.891
They're having a horrific crime described
to them. They have to blame someone.

18:12.973 --> 18:13.962
Yeah. Me.

18:14.053 --> 18:16.851
All they've done
is establish that a murder occurred.

18:16.933 --> 18:20.642
- Everybody knew that.
- They have to establish <i>you</i> are responsible.

18:20.733 --> 18:23.406
- Sounds like they have.
- We could put you on the stand.

18:23.493 --> 18:27.930
Absolutely. Put me on.
Didn't that lady say I ooze charm?

18:28.013 --> 18:33.406
Did you murder Deputy Director Kirby?

18:34.133 --> 18:36.363
No, I did not.

18:40.173 --> 18:43.051
- I can't put you on.
- What? I'm not emotional enough?

18:43.133 --> 18:45.124
I would never kill another man.

18:45.213 --> 18:49.047
No! Because it would be obvious to the judge,
the jury, and blind Martians

18:49.133 --> 18:51.089
that your family doesn't believe you.

18:51.173 --> 18:52.970
We'll wait outside.

18:53.053 --> 18:56.250
Thanks. So I'm on the hot seat
and you're out getting ice cream?

18:56.333 --> 18:59.086
Kids don't believe the dad,
no way the jury does.

18:59.173 --> 19:04.042
- Next issue to consider is Russ.
- Let him put me on the stand.

19:04.133 --> 19:08.365
- They think you witnessed a murder.
- I didn't. I wasn't there.

19:09.573 --> 19:10.767
I wasn't there!

19:10.853 --> 19:15.404
I cannot put you on the stand
if I think you're gonna perjure yourself.

19:15.493 --> 19:18.405
- You think Russ is lying?
- I don't know, which worries me.

19:18.493 --> 19:20.848
He's not.
I've known Russ since he was a child

19:20.933 --> 19:23.163
and I can tell when he's lying.
He's not.

19:23.253 --> 19:26.882
Put me on the stand. I didn't witness
anything they can use against him.

19:26.973 --> 19:28.964
Attaboy.

19:30.253 --> 19:34.644
Listen, take a few family minutes.
I'll see you in court.

19:38.973 --> 19:44.252
A country full of unscrupulous lawyers,
and you find the one guy with scruples?

19:44.333 --> 19:48.167
Dad, Tempe's pretty sure
you killed that man

19:48.253 --> 19:51.211
and I don't think she can see
how you wear that so lightly.

19:51.293 --> 19:53.488
Tempe...

19:53.573 --> 19:56.406
I'm ashamed of a lot of things
I did in my life.

19:56.493 --> 20:00.486
But in this case...
my conscience is clear.

20:03.013 --> 20:06.244
That's not the same as being innocent.

20:21.373 --> 20:25.764
Angela, please just go on the stand
and say that you identified the victim.

20:25.853 --> 20:28.606
- No.
- But I want you to do that.

20:28.693 --> 20:33.164
- Do you think your father will beat this rap?
- That has nothing to do with it!

20:33.253 --> 20:37.769
Yeah, Brennan, it does. I'm not gonna help
send your father to his death.

20:37.853 --> 20:38.888
To his death?

20:38.973 --> 20:42.886
Look, your old man
killed a really big kahuna at the FBI.

20:42.973 --> 20:45.282
You think they're not gunning for execution?

20:45.373 --> 20:48.922
That's not up to me. That's not up to you.
That's up to a jury.

20:49.013 --> 20:51.402
- That's not the point.
- What is the point?

20:51.493 --> 20:55.850
Friends don't send friends' fathers
to the electric chair.

20:57.653 --> 21:01.931
- Maryland uses lethal injection.
- Well, the principle holds, sweetie.

21:03.613 --> 21:06.047
You think we're going to lose?

21:09.213 --> 21:10.487
Yeah.

21:13.573 --> 21:16.133
I think you're gonna lose.

21:17.253 --> 21:20.131
And I am not gonna help you.

21:23.213 --> 21:26.603
What did I do to deserve a friend like you?

21:32.693 --> 21:36.527
I obtained my undergraduate psych degree
from the University of Toronto,

21:36.613 --> 21:39.923
my master's in abnormal psychology
from Temple University,

21:40.013 --> 21:43.210
and my doctorates
in clinical psychology and behavioural...

21:43.293 --> 21:45.284
"Doctorates"? As in more than one?

21:45.373 --> 21:48.410
I won simultaneous
Fulbright and Rhodes scholarships...

21:48.493 --> 21:50.643
More than one scholarship, too.

21:50.733 --> 21:53.201
...which brought me
to my current post at the FBI.

21:53.293 --> 21:55.932
No wonder Dr Geeks
can never hang on to a girlfriend.

21:56.013 --> 21:58.573
- It's Dr Sweets.
- I know, Bones.

21:58.653 --> 22:01.008
I was just saying Dr Geeks as in geeks.

22:01.093 --> 22:03.368
Do you require a list
of my publications?

22:03.453 --> 22:07.287
The defence stipulates that Dr Sweets
is a qualified expert witness,

22:07.373 --> 22:10.206
despite looking like
a high-school volleyball player.

22:10.293 --> 22:11.851
Meet Dr Geeks.

22:11.933 --> 22:16.165
Excuse me. Agent Booth, I would like you
to switch seats with Dr Saroyan.

22:16.253 --> 22:18.813
You, Dr Brennan,
switch seats with your brother.

22:18.893 --> 22:21.566
- Why?
- You don't whisper as quietly as you think.

22:21.653 --> 22:23.564
You do whisper a little loud.

22:23.653 --> 22:27.089
- You started it.
- Just a little bit. A little loud.

22:27.733 --> 22:30.293
Thank you.
Please continue, Miss Julian.

22:30.373 --> 22:34.127
Dr Sweets, did you compile
a psychological profile of the defendant?

22:34.213 --> 22:36.932
Yes. Over a series of meetings
spanning six months.

22:37.013 --> 22:40.642
- Is he capable of murder?
- Like, totally.

22:41.133 --> 22:43.124
Most definitely.

22:43.213 --> 22:46.444
In his own way, Max Keenan
is a very impressive man.

22:46.533 --> 22:48.205
What do you mean, "in his own way"?

22:48.293 --> 22:51.603
Max Keenan doesn't adhere
to an external ethical system.

22:51.693 --> 22:54.446
- He does what he wants?
- No, what he thinks is right,

22:54.533 --> 22:58.970
whether or not the world agrees. In another
time, he could've been a great leader.

22:59.053 --> 23:02.329
You mean in a time when people
conked each other on the head

23:02.413 --> 23:05.803
and lit them on fire
as a way of getting what they want?

23:05.893 --> 23:06.882
Yes.

23:06.973 --> 23:08.770
Is Max Keenan dangerous?

23:08.853 --> 23:12.926
When he feels his loved ones
are threatened... mega-dangerous.

23:13.013 --> 23:17.245
In your opinion, if Max Keenan felt
that he or his family was threatened,

23:17.333 --> 23:19.244
could he do this?

23:19.333 --> 23:21.688
Totally.

23:22.173 --> 23:24.562
I mean... indubitably.

23:24.653 --> 23:30.091
- Without hesitation?
- Without hesitation, without remorse...

23:31.933 --> 23:34.049
without guilt.

23:40.213 --> 23:44.764
Without hesitation.
Without remorse. Without guilt.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.653
Did you feel threatened by Kirby,
Mr Brennan?

23:50.733 --> 23:51.643
No.

23:51.733 --> 23:56.170
A sniper-trained, corrupt FBI agent
hunting you, and you weren't scared?

23:56.253 --> 23:58.483
I knew someone was after me,
but not who.

23:58.573 --> 24:02.612
- How did you know someone was after you?
- I was shot at. I was wounded.

24:02.693 --> 24:05.207
- So you feared for your life?
- Yes.

24:05.293 --> 24:07.761
- Where were you staying?
- My sister's apartment.

24:07.853 --> 24:12.290
- Which is where Kirby was murdered.
- Where his blood was found, yeah.

24:12.373 --> 24:14.728
- But you weren't there when it happened?
- No.

24:14.813 --> 24:18.522
Someone was gunning for you,
but you left the safety of her apartment?

24:18.613 --> 24:21.491
It wasn't that safe
if someone got murdered there, right?

24:21.573 --> 24:23.609
No, it wasn't, Mr Brennan.

24:23.693 --> 24:25.524
- Where were you?
- Job interview.

24:25.613 --> 24:29.572
You were being stalked, but it seemed
a good time to wander out looking for a job?

24:29.653 --> 24:33.646
No, not wander.
I went to a specific job interview.

24:36.373 --> 24:39.843
- What's wrong?
- I know when Caroline's catching a scent.

24:39.933 --> 24:43.642
- What job?
- Objection, Your Honour. Relevance?

24:43.733 --> 24:48.204
If the People could have a little latitude,
the relevance will become apparent.

24:48.293 --> 24:51.410
- I'll allow it. Answer the question.
- A mechanics job.

24:51.493 --> 24:55.406
- And how did you find out about this job?
- What?

24:55.493 --> 25:00.283
A sign in a window, an agency, the internet,
a newspaper? Where did you find this job?

25:00.373 --> 25:02.523
- Objection, Your Honour!
- Overruled.

25:02.613 --> 25:05.889
My dad got me... the interview.

25:05.973 --> 25:08.407
Almost as if he wanted you
out of the apartment.

25:08.493 --> 25:12.168
As if he knew something was gonna happen
and he wanted you out of the way.

25:12.253 --> 25:15.325
- Your Honour...
- Out of bounds. Jury will disregard.

25:15.413 --> 25:19.531
- I'm done with this witness, Your Honour.
- Cross, Mr Barron?

25:19.613 --> 25:24.368
Did your father say or do anything
that suggested he wanted you out of the way?

25:24.453 --> 25:25.772
No.

25:26.773 --> 25:29.003
- Thank you, Your Honour.
- Miss Julian?

25:29.093 --> 25:30.970
The People rest, Your Honour.

25:32.053 --> 25:36.763
- Will the defence be ready this afternoon?
- The defence requests a summary judgement

25:36.853 --> 25:41.051
because the prosecution
has absolutely failed to prove their case.

25:41.133 --> 25:43.442
Denied, Mr Barron.

25:43.533 --> 25:45.922
Then we'll be ready this afternoon.

26:02.613 --> 26:04.763
What are you doing?

26:05.533 --> 26:09.208
Dr Addy, the prosecution
must share information with the defence,

26:09.293 --> 26:11.045
not the other way around.

26:11.133 --> 26:14.045
- That better not stain.
- It's not permanent.

26:14.133 --> 26:18.490
- What are you doing here?
- I wondered if you found anything I missed.

26:18.573 --> 26:24.170
- You're not allowed to ask me that.
- I didn't ask. You asked me, I answered.

26:25.693 --> 26:29.481
You're not screwing with me, are you?
You're just like this?

26:29.573 --> 26:32.212
Yes. This is exactly how I am.

26:34.293 --> 26:37.444
Your work is very, very good, Dr Addy.

26:37.533 --> 26:39.330
Extremely thorough.

26:39.413 --> 26:41.802
Thank you. I am aware of that.

26:43.453 --> 26:46.013
Good luck this afternoon.

26:46.653 --> 26:49.565
I don't need luck, sport.

26:50.493 --> 26:52.245
Psst.

26:56.173 --> 27:00.928
I'm writing a book taking a clinical approach
to efficacy and focused outcomes.

27:01.013 --> 27:03.811
You shouldn't work well together.
I'd like to study it.

27:03.893 --> 27:06.009
- I don't get it.
- He wants to study us.

27:06.093 --> 27:07.606
Once a week. Nothing changes.

27:07.693 --> 27:10.890
- Why would we want to do that?
- I can't think of a good reason.

27:10.973 --> 27:15.728
OK, see? That thing you do when you talk to
each other while excluding a third party - me -

27:15.813 --> 27:18.805
it's an adaptive mechanism
for disparate entities

27:18.893 --> 27:23.887
to bond together against
their own individual impetuses to dissociate.

27:23.973 --> 27:26.407
It's, um... It's what...

27:26.493 --> 27:28.927
- What does that mean for us?
- Nothing useful.

27:29.013 --> 27:32.926
Tell you what. Why don't we make a deal
where we allow him to study us?

27:33.013 --> 27:36.926
In return, he gives us
psychological profiling on demand.

27:37.013 --> 27:39.481
- OK.
- You like that, but I don't see the point.

27:39.573 --> 27:43.122
I just think he doesn't want to admit
that he likes us.

27:43.213 --> 27:45.329
- Do you like us?
- What?

27:45.413 --> 27:49.964
- And he wants to spend time with us.
- Is that true, Sweets? Do you like us?

27:50.053 --> 27:52.009
- No.
-  He really likes us.

27:52.093 --> 27:57.008
You know what? I'm sorry I made the offer.
I take it back. Forget it.

27:58.693 --> 28:01.810
Sweets is pretty good
in the interrogation room.

28:01.893 --> 28:04.123
Profiling, interrogation backup...

28:04.213 --> 28:07.011
To be honest,
I was impressed by his credentials.

28:07.813 --> 28:11.249
- I'll tell him OK.
- Dr Brennan.

28:11.333 --> 28:13.563
I found something.

28:19.533 --> 28:21.524
I do not like the look of that.

28:21.613 --> 28:23.569
- Why?
- They look happy.

28:23.653 --> 28:27.282
All rise.
This court is reconvened.

28:27.373 --> 28:29.762
They look smug. I don't like it.

28:29.853 --> 28:32.367
Any way Clark found
something you missed?

28:32.453 --> 28:34.523
I don't miss things.

28:34.613 --> 28:37.889
The defence calls Dr Zack Addy to the stand.

28:37.973 --> 28:40.089
I beg the indulgence of the court

28:40.173 --> 28:44.610
to allow our expert witness, Dr Clark Edison,
to appear <i>pro hac vice.</i>

28:44.693 --> 28:47.002
- Objection.
- What grounds, Miss Julian?

28:47.093 --> 28:48.811
- Well...
- What's going on?

28:48.893 --> 28:51.009
They want Clark to question Zack.

28:51.093 --> 28:55.052
- I'm thinking...
- Objection denied. Dr Edison?

28:55.973 --> 29:00.489
Good afternoon. Dr Addy,
you identified this as the murder weapon.

29:00.573 --> 29:03.485
- That's correct.
- Could you refresh the jury's memory?

29:03.573 --> 29:08.363
Yes. Striations found on the bone indicated a
sharp-tipped weapon without a cutting edge.

29:08.453 --> 29:14.562
- Also, the diameter of the pipe fits.
- That's correct. And copper particulates.

29:15.253 --> 29:17.369
Can you identify this, Dr Addy?

29:17.453 --> 29:20.445
It is the entry wound
made by the murder weapon.

29:20.533 --> 29:23.809
- And this?
- This is the same wound stained red.

29:23.893 --> 29:26.691
Is this what you were doing this morning?

29:27.253 --> 29:28.481
And this?

29:28.573 --> 29:33.567
It appears to be the same wound
blown up to approximately 120 magnification.

29:33.653 --> 29:36.121
Can you discern any micro-fractures?

29:36.213 --> 29:38.807
Yes... Oh.

29:38.893 --> 29:42.090
- You sound surprised, Dr Addy.
- What did you stain this with?

29:42.173 --> 29:45.370
Red food dye.
Can you answer that question, please?

29:45.453 --> 29:48.763
These micro-fractures indicate
that the weapon went in so deep

29:48.853 --> 29:51.447
that the hilt hit the bone,
causing micro-fractures.

29:51.533 --> 29:53.012
The hilt?

29:53.093 --> 29:55.766
Could you please indicate
the hilt on this weapon?

29:55.853 --> 29:57.411
I cannot.

29:57.493 --> 29:59.768
- And why is that?
- There is no hilt.

29:59.853 --> 30:03.607
- So this is not the murder weapon?
- Obviously not.

30:07.813 --> 30:09.963
You made a mistake?

30:11.373 --> 30:13.091
Yes, I was mistaken.

30:13.613 --> 30:17.242
Your Honour, the defence requests
a dismissal of all charges.

30:17.333 --> 30:22.043
The prosecution's entire case was built upon
the identification of the murder weapon.

30:22.133 --> 30:26.570
Your Honour, the People will need time
to properly review Dr Edison's new evidence.

30:26.653 --> 30:28.689
- How much time?
- Exactly as much time

30:28.773 --> 30:31.810
as it will take Agent Booth
to find the actual murder weapon.

30:31.893 --> 30:35.681
We'll meet in chambers. But if you don't
come up with a terrific argument,

30:35.773 --> 30:39.766
Mr Keenan is going home
to his family tonight.

30:39.853 --> 30:42.003
All rise.

30:53.293 --> 30:55.568
I have a warrant
to search these premises

30:55.653 --> 30:58.451
for any implement
congruent with the murder weapon.

30:58.533 --> 31:00.489
- I could save you some time.
- No.

31:00.573 --> 31:03.849
Zack is the bone expert on this one.
He'll be doing the looking.

31:03.933 --> 31:07.482
Where did Clark Edison
learn that trick with the food dye?

31:07.573 --> 31:10.087
Zack? Focus.

31:20.293 --> 31:22.329
How you doing there, Bones?

31:22.413 --> 31:26.486
When it looked like
my father might go free, I got...

31:28.333 --> 31:30.642
This is very confusing for me.

31:31.213 --> 31:35.411
You liked the idea
of him beating the murder charge?

31:35.493 --> 31:37.165
Yes.

31:37.253 --> 31:40.404
But he did it.
We both know my father did it.

31:40.493 --> 31:45.408
Bones, wanting your father to come home
instead of going to prison, that's OK.

31:45.493 --> 31:50.362
But what I do...
What we do is put murderers like him away.

31:50.453 --> 31:54.082
OK. You're not Dr Brennan today.
You're Temperance.

31:54.813 --> 31:56.804
I don't know what that means.

31:56.893 --> 32:00.203
The scientist part of you
got sidelined temporarily.

32:02.253 --> 32:04.244
I still don't know what that means.

32:04.333 --> 32:08.849
Bones, just take the brain, OK,
put it in neutral. All right?

32:08.933 --> 32:12.721
Take the heart, pop it in overdrive.

32:12.813 --> 32:16.852
Sometimes I think
you're from another planet.

32:20.613 --> 32:23.605
And sometimes I think
you're really very nice.

32:27.653 --> 32:29.883
I found it.

32:37.293 --> 32:40.569
- What is that?
- It's a misericord.

32:40.653 --> 32:46.091
A sharp, unedged medieval copper dagger
used for delivering a final, fatal blow.

32:46.173 --> 32:49.051
Also known as the <i>coup de grâce.</i>

32:49.733 --> 32:51.803
I'm sorry, Bones.

33:31.853 --> 33:36.051
As usual, I will ask the jury to refrain
from speaking to each other about the case

33:36.133 --> 33:38.408
between now
and when we reconvene tomorrow.

33:38.493 --> 33:43.203
At which time, you will be prepared
to remount your defence.

33:44.413 --> 33:46.768
All rise.

33:52.973 --> 33:57.285
Hey, kid, you did good.
You had 'em on the run there for a while.

33:57.373 --> 34:00.570
Yeah, well, their case
is much stronger now, so...

34:00.653 --> 34:04.328
My team, they're... they're really good.

34:04.413 --> 34:08.452
Maybe you could brag over them
another time, Tempe?

34:09.453 --> 34:12.684
You know,
maybe I can discredit the weapon.

34:12.773 --> 34:15.764
We're past forensics.
Now it's about the story.

34:15.853 --> 34:17.081
Excuse me?

34:17.172 --> 34:20.609
Jurors like to think
they know what happened.

34:20.693 --> 34:23.764
We showed that maybe
Max didn't commit this murder,

34:23.853 --> 34:27.732
but we didn't give the jury
a satisfying alternative.

34:28.453 --> 34:32.571
One they can go home to their families
and say, "Here's what really happened."

34:32.652 --> 34:35.406
They need a bogeyman. And it's Dad.

34:35.493 --> 34:38.087
Well, at least you'll always
know where to find me.

34:38.172 --> 34:40.129
You mean on death row?

34:40.213 --> 34:43.250
You know, you should've run, Dad.
Just taken off.

34:43.333 --> 34:45.085
Dad stayed for <i>me.</i>

34:47.893 --> 34:52.205
He knew that if he ran,
we'd never see each other again.

34:53.293 --> 34:55.568
You stayed for me.

34:57.733 --> 35:00.167
I would've stayed here forever.

35:00.253 --> 35:04.804
It was worth every second...
we had together.

35:13.813 --> 35:17.772
If I knew the bogeyman, how much warning
would you need to make it work?

35:17.853 --> 35:21.129
A good story? About five minutes.

35:22.133 --> 35:24.203
I have to talk to somebody.

35:28.333 --> 35:31.405
If the truth can't be proven,
is it still the truth?

35:31.493 --> 35:33.563
You invited me here to talk philosophy?

35:33.653 --> 35:38.807
A theory isn't even really a theory until
it's challenged. It's just simply a hypothesis.

35:38.893 --> 35:42.568
I don't believe a man should die
based upon a hypothesis. Do you?

35:42.653 --> 35:46.885
- If you have a question, just ask it.
- I have a way to lodge reasonable doubt.

35:46.973 --> 35:51.922
- We can't talk about this.
- Please? You're the person I talk to.

35:55.253 --> 35:57.403
No perjury involved?

35:57.493 --> 36:01.691
- Just an interpretation of existing facts?
- An alternate story.

36:01.773 --> 36:05.243
- You don't know that he did it, you know.
- We both know he did it.

36:05.333 --> 36:09.531
Not the way that you define "know".
You know, with proof and all that.

36:09.613 --> 36:13.765
- It's going to be enough for the jury.
- Juries are the human factor in a trial.

36:13.853 --> 36:15.889
You never know what they'll do.

36:15.973 --> 36:19.010
You think it's all right
for me to take advantage of that?

36:19.093 --> 36:21.402
Brain and heart, Bones.

36:21.493 --> 36:23.802
Brain and heart.

36:27.013 --> 36:31.291
You found particulates placing the accused
at the scene of the murder, the seminary,

36:31.373 --> 36:33.728
and the rooftop
where the victim was immolated?

36:33.813 --> 36:34.802
Yes.

36:34.893 --> 36:38.966
Was anyone else
present at all three locations?

36:39.053 --> 36:41.931
Me. But I didn't kill
the deputy director of the FBI.

36:42.013 --> 36:46.052
You had motive. He'd fired you that day.
And threatened Miss Julian.

36:46.133 --> 36:48.408
By the way,
was she at all three locations?

36:48.493 --> 36:51.451
Objection!
It's just rude to accuse me of murder.

36:51.533 --> 36:56.243
I count three people in this court besides
my client who had motive to kill Kirby.

36:56.333 --> 36:57.322
I'll allow it.

36:57.413 --> 37:01.486
Miss Julian was never at the crime scene.
So you're stuck with me.

37:01.573 --> 37:03.768
And Dr Brennan?

37:06.213 --> 37:11.003
- I see where you're going with this.
- Was Dr Brennan at the seminary?

37:11.093 --> 37:13.368
- Yes.
- And your apartment the same day?

37:13.453 --> 37:14.568
Yes.

37:14.653 --> 37:17.531
- Do you recognise this?
- Yes. It's mine.

37:17.613 --> 37:20.923
So you are every bit as plausible a suspect
as your father.

37:21.013 --> 37:24.972
Dr Brennan is hyper-rational,
capable of rationalising almost anything.

37:25.053 --> 37:29.205
- Including murder?
- It is the danger of the totally rational being.

37:29.293 --> 37:31.568
But did she have a motive?

37:32.173 --> 37:35.449
Yes, she had motive.
Kirby tried to kill her brother.

37:35.533 --> 37:38.331
- Thank you.
- Bones was with me all day.

37:38.413 --> 37:41.291
She didn't have time
to commit this murder?

37:41.373 --> 37:42.772
No, she did not.

37:42.853 --> 37:46.846
How did your son Parker
get home from school that day?

37:49.693 --> 37:52.366
45 minutes we were apart.
But we talked on the phone.

37:52.453 --> 37:54.967
Plenty of time, wasn't it, Agent Booth?

38:02.253 --> 38:07.373
Dr Brennan could've burned the body
hours later when you were safe at home.

38:15.893 --> 38:18.282
The witness will answer the question.

38:18.373 --> 38:23.401
- That's a lot of heart, Bones.
- Answer the question, please, Agent Booth.

38:23.493 --> 38:25.802
Could Bones have killed Kirby?

38:25.893 --> 38:29.044
I've worked with this woman.
I've stood over death with her.

38:29.133 --> 38:31.567
I've faced down death with her.

38:32.093 --> 38:35.608
And Sweets, he's brilliant. He is.
But he's wrong.

38:37.733 --> 38:39.530
She could not have done this.

38:39.613 --> 38:43.288
I didn't ask you
your opinion of Dr Brennan's character.

38:43.373 --> 38:46.604
I asked you: did she have time?

38:55.573 --> 38:58.326
Yes. She had time.

39:06.893 --> 39:10.681
# <i>Fountain, fountain</i>

39:10.773 --> 39:13.685

So? You gonna charge her?

40:25.573 --> 40:29.532
You gotta go back to school on this one.
That's a fine woman there.
