        Cheers <i>is filmed</i>        
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i> 

00:08.200 --> 00:10.300
      Well, Rebecca, how are you
        on this magnificent day?

00:10.400 --> 00:12.100
None of your business.          

00:12.200 --> 00:14.900
         (imitating John Wayne):
          Well, who stuck a burr
    under your saddle, missy?   

00:16.300 --> 00:18.800
 Sorry, Frasier, I've just been 
     in a bad mood lately.      

00:18.900 --> 00:20.100
         Would you like         
    to talk about it?           

00:20.100 --> 00:21.700
         It might help          
 to alleviate your depression.  

00:21.700 --> 00:24.300
No, I really wouldn't feel      
  comfortable talking to you.   

00:24.400 --> 00:25.500
          Why is that?          

00:25.600 --> 00:27.400
  Because you know me too well  
 to think of me as a therapist? 

00:27.500 --> 00:29.200
     No, because I saw you      
     dance around this bar      

00:29.300 --> 00:31.400
    in your underwear, with     
  swizzle sticks in your ears,  

00:31.400 --> 00:33.500
     when they brought back     
         Classic Coke.          

00:35.700 --> 00:37.700
         Well, granted,         
  that wasn't my finest hour,   

00:37.800 --> 00:39.700
    but you <i>can</i> taste           
        the difference.         

00:41.000 --> 00:42.200
                Now, Rebecca,   

00:42.300 --> 00:43.800
counseling people is what I do. 

00:43.900 --> 00:45.400
    Please let me help you.     

00:45.400 --> 00:47.300
(sighing):                      
All right, Frasier.             

00:47.300 --> 00:49.900
It's just that I can't seem     
to make anything work.          

00:50.000 --> 00:51.900
  Robin is in prison.           

00:52.000 --> 00:53.600
I manage this crummy bar.       

00:53.700 --> 00:55.000
My career is                    
at a standstill.                

00:55.100 --> 00:56.800
I'm miserable.                  
I'm lonely.                     

00:56.900 --> 00:59.100
            And now,            
  I have to sell my Mercedes.   

00:59.200 --> 01:00.800
                 I see.         

01:00.900 --> 01:04.200
         Well, I'll, uh...      
      I'll give you $5,000 cash 

01:04.200 --> 01:06.000
             and take over      
             your payments.     

01:06.100 --> 01:06.800
     Six thousand firm.         
                        Deal.   

01:06.800 --> 01:07.900
      Thank you.                

01:08.000 --> 01:09.300
                 Damn!          
        It's good to heal.      

01:11.400 --> 01:13.100

01:15.300 --> 01:17.600

02:22.900 --> 02:24.500
                  You know, Sam,
                this is a treat.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.400
              I've got this side
        of the bar to myself.   

02:26.500 --> 02:28.300
             I can drink my beer
          and enjoy my newspaper

02:28.300 --> 02:30.800
    without being pummeled on   
    every side by inane chatter.

02:30.800 --> 02:32.000
     Yep.                       

02:32.100 --> 02:35.000
          Say, look...          
      well, look at this.       

02:35.000 --> 02:37.200
  There is barometric pressure  
        on Venus.               

02:37.300 --> 02:38.600
          Now, how did          
    they measure that?          

02:38.700 --> 02:40.500
        Beats me.               

02:40.500 --> 02:43.700
  A man was reunited with his   
  twin brother after 30 years.  

02:43.800 --> 02:46.400
    They worked in the same     
 auto plant in Columbus, Ohio!  

02:46.400 --> 02:48.200
          That's nice.          

02:48.200 --> 02:50.600
 Say, would anybody like me to  
read their, uh, their horoscope?

02:50.600 --> 02:52.000
  I'll, uh, start with Aries.   

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
     Somebody want to play      
     with Frasier, please?      

02:54.900 --> 02:55.900
        Hi, Sammy.              

02:56.000 --> 02:57.600
        Sorry I'm late.         

02:57.600 --> 03:01.000
There's a prison work crew      
 in the park across the street. 

03:01.000 --> 03:03.900
Man, you should have heard      
some of those raunchy,          
sleazy, come-ons.               

03:04.000 --> 03:05.200
                Pretty bad, huh?
  Oh, yeah.                     

03:05.300 --> 03:07.100
I really outdid myself.         

03:07.200 --> 03:08.500
I should write a book.          

03:10.000 --> 03:13.300
Hey, Becks, you know, you might 
     be interested to know      

03:13.300 --> 03:15.000
that one of those cons          
      out there                 

03:15.100 --> 03:17.800
 is your pasty-faced,           
billionaire boyfriend.          

03:17.900 --> 03:19.700
                     Robin?     
Yeah.                           

03:19.800 --> 03:21.800
He was out there                
picking up trash.               

03:21.800 --> 03:25.600
    I wonder if he was using    
 the same line he used on you.  

03:26.600 --> 03:27.800
            My poor, sweet baby.

03:27.900 --> 03:29.800
      I better go see him.      

03:30.900 --> 03:32.800
        Oh, wait--              
    no, I better not.           

03:32.900 --> 03:35.800
 If the other guys get jealous, 
they might give him a hard time.

03:35.900 --> 03:37.200
But then,                       
if I don't go see him,          

03:37.300 --> 03:39.500
then he'll probably think       
    that I'm ashamed of him.    

03:39.600 --> 03:42.200
 But if I see him, it might be  
    all too painful for him.    

03:42.300 --> 03:43.700
    What should I do?           
         I don't know.          

03:43.700 --> 03:45.100
    What do you think           
          I should do?          

03:45.200 --> 03:47.900
Twins in the same               
auto plant?                     

03:49.500 --> 03:50.900
    Come on, you guys.          

03:51.000 --> 03:52.200
      You just don't care.      

03:52.300 --> 03:54.400
Honey, I'm trying               
like hell to care.              

03:54.500 --> 03:56.100
Look, if it means               
that much to you,               

03:56.200 --> 03:59.000
why don't you run outside       
there and blow him a kiss.      

03:59.100 --> 04:00.400
          Yeah, right.          

04:00.400 --> 04:03.200
  Get him in trouble so he has  
 to spend the night in the box. 

04:03.300 --> 04:04.400
        (sarcastically):        
        Blow him a kiss.        

04:04.500 --> 04:07.100
     You heartless bastard.     

04:08.700 --> 04:11.400
  Boy, it must be pretty rough  
on ol' Robin Colcord, huh?      

04:11.400 --> 04:13.100
      One day he's living       
        in a penthouse,         

04:13.200 --> 04:15.400
  the next day he's picking up  
      trash with a stick.       

04:15.500 --> 04:17.200
             You're loving this,
              aren't you, Sammy?

04:17.300 --> 04:19.600
         Every minute.          

04:21.500 --> 04:23.600
        Sam, you missed         
         a great lunch.         

04:23.600 --> 04:26.900
  Mr. Clavin and Mr. Peterson   
treated me at the Hungry Heifer.

04:27.000 --> 04:27.900
                            SAM:
                     How was it?

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
  Wednesday Ribscapade, Sammy.  

04:30.000 --> 04:32.300
         End of story.          

04:32.300 --> 04:33.800
                Well, where's   
                the third member

04:33.900 --> 04:36.700
             of your gastronomic
                  suicide squad?

04:36.800 --> 04:39.300
Mr. Peterson's                  
still at the Heifer.            

04:39.400 --> 04:40.900
         Uh, you know,          
     we got some bad news.      

04:41.000 --> 04:42.400
         They're gonna          
      tear the place down.      

04:42.500 --> 04:43.600
        Oh, dear!               

04:43.700 --> 04:46.600
 Well, I can see why Norm would 
want to spend some final moments

04:46.600 --> 04:49.100
 of contemplation in the place  
that meant so much to him.      

04:49.200 --> 04:50.900
      No, no, he was just       
     sopping up some gravy      

04:51.000 --> 04:52.400
with a Parker House roll.       

04:54.200 --> 04:56.400
     Well, each man mourns      
        in his own way.         

04:56.500 --> 04:58.100
        I hope it doesn't       
        hit him too hard.       

04:58.200 --> 04:59.200
            What's the big deal?

04:59.200 --> 05:01.300
             So they're leveling
             another beef joint.

05:01.400 --> 05:02.200
Another beef joint?             

05:02.300 --> 05:03.700
You obviously                   
have never been there           

05:03.800 --> 05:06.000
for "You Keep                   
the Hoof" night.                

05:06.100 --> 05:09.000
Well, you know, this is         
not atypical behavior.          

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
      I mean, many people       
    can form emotional bonds    

05:11.100 --> 05:12.400
     to significant places      
        in their lives.         

05:12.500 --> 05:14.300
     I think we should all      
    be very sensitive           

05:14.300 --> 05:15.800
          to what Norm          
    is going through.           

05:15.800 --> 05:17.300
             Yeah, you know,    
    that's a good idea, Fras.   

05:17.400 --> 05:18.900
Maybe we shouldn't say anything 
         to remind him          

05:18.900 --> 05:20.700
      of the Hungry Heifer      
    when he comes back here.    

05:20.700 --> 05:24.700
You know, maybe not say         
any words like, uh,             
"beef" or "meat."               

05:24.700 --> 05:27.700
          Sam, what about "meet"
              as in, "Let's meet
            for dinner tonight?"

05:29.100 --> 05:30.300
         Yeah.                  
That'd be fine, Woody.          

05:30.400 --> 05:31.800
                 Great.         
      W-Where do you want to go?

05:31.900 --> 05:33.100
          You feel like Chinese?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.300
You know, on second thought,    
maybe that's not a good idea.   

05:38.400 --> 05:40.100
             That's why I asked.

05:45.400 --> 05:46.200
     Afternoon, everybody.      

05:46.400 --> 05:48.600
                          GROUP:
                        Norm!   

05:48.700 --> 05:49.900
 Hey, how's life treatin' you,  
          there, Norm?          

05:50.000 --> 05:51.300
          Beats me...           

05:51.300 --> 05:55.900
            then it kicks me and
             leaves me for dead.

05:55.900 --> 05:58.200
Well, here's a... here's a      
 cold one for you there, buddy. 

05:59.300 --> 06:01.400
Hey, uh, Norm,                  

06:01.500 --> 06:04.200
how about some of these         
extra-salty pretzels            

06:04.300 --> 06:06.900
you so heartily                 
enjoy, huh?                     

06:06.900 --> 06:09.900
  You're welcome to share some  
 of my beer nuts, if you like.  

06:16.500 --> 06:18.400
     Meat!                      

06:18.500 --> 06:19.400
        (all clamoring)         

06:19.500 --> 06:20.700
Aw, everybody was               
thinking it!                    

06:20.700 --> 06:23.600
I was the only one who          
had the guts to say it!         

06:25.300 --> 06:26.300
    We're sorry, man.           

06:26.400 --> 06:28.400
    We-We-We feel bad           
    'cause we know how much     

06:28.400 --> 06:30.000
the Hungry Heifer means to you. 

06:30.000 --> 06:32.400
         You don't know         
     the half of it, Sammy.     

06:32.500 --> 06:33.400
    I love the Heifer.          

06:33.500 --> 06:34.800
SAM:                            
Aww...                          

06:34.900 --> 06:37.000
  Don't know what I'm gonna do  
      without that place.       

06:37.100 --> 06:39.300
      It was like my home       
    away from Cheers.           

06:43.400 --> 06:45.700
If you'll excuse me, guys, I... 

06:45.800 --> 06:47.300
     just want to be alone.     

06:51.500 --> 06:52.800
                  Hey, whoa! Ho.

06:52.900 --> 06:55.300
                 Not that alone.

06:55.400 --> 06:58.600
     Well, they're carting      
         the cons away.         

06:58.700 --> 06:59.400
        Robin's leaving?        

06:59.500 --> 07:00.500
     Yeah, just loaded him      

07:00.600 --> 07:02.800
  and his sunburned pals        
      into the van.             

07:02.800 --> 07:04.400
Mm, he was red as a lobster.    

07:04.400 --> 07:05.700
  Bet he blisters.              

07:05.800 --> 07:07.200
                Carla, honey,   
        I don't think Rebecca   

07:07.300 --> 07:08.900
             wants to talk about
                 this right now.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.100
              I mean, after all,
              her guy's in jail.

07:11.100 --> 07:13.200
        I mean, she's lonely,   
                  she's hurting.

07:13.300 --> 07:14.600
          She's a woman in need.

07:14.700 --> 07:17.300
             She misses her man.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.100
        (sighing):              
        I do, Sam. I do.        

07:20.800 --> 07:23.300
Say, hon...                     

07:23.400 --> 07:25.000
I just want to say that...      

07:25.000 --> 07:27.200
I know what you're going through
        right now,              

07:27.300 --> 07:29.200
and if there's anything         
  I can do for you,             

07:29.300 --> 07:31.500
    or <i>to</i> you...                

07:31.600 --> 07:32.800
I'm here for you.               

07:32.800 --> 07:35.400
Or there for you or on          
the floor for you, it's...      

07:36.500 --> 07:37.700
                Gee, Sam.       

07:37.700 --> 07:40.600
      When you put it like that,
          you make me sick.     

07:40.700 --> 07:42.200
Well, you think about it,       
            though--            

07:42.200 --> 07:43.900
 I mean, 'cause you're thinking 
      about it right now.       

07:44.000 --> 07:45.900
    I bet if I took an X-ray    
         of your brain,         

07:46.000 --> 07:48.700
      I'd be lying, right       
    stretched out all naked.    

07:48.800 --> 07:51.100
             Don't leave out the
                tag on your toe.

07:53.300 --> 07:54.900
         Would that tag         
         happen to say:         

07:54.900 --> 07:56.800
    "For a good time,           
    follow this leg?"           

07:59.100 --> 08:00.300
          (laughing):           
             Whee!              

08:00.300 --> 08:02.900
        I sure know how         
  to make my own fun, don't I?  

08:04.400 --> 08:08.400
        Guys, look, uh, sorry   
     I was getting all emotional

08:08.400 --> 08:10.400
                about the Hungry
            Heifer, I mean...   

08:10.500 --> 08:11.600
Aw...                           

08:11.700 --> 08:12.800
                  It's just that
            I'm losing someplace

08:12.900 --> 08:14.200
                 that's so close
                    to my heart.

08:14.200 --> 08:17.900
         Don't you mean         
      clogging your heart?      

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
 Well, Norm, there <i>are</i>          
 other restaurants.             

08:20.000 --> 08:21.300
                        NORM:   
                It's not just   
                 the restaurant,

08:21.400 --> 08:22.600
     it's the owner, okay?      

08:22.700 --> 08:24.200
          Sid Nelson.           

08:24.300 --> 08:26.300
He's a funny kind of guy,       
        you know?               

08:26.400 --> 08:28.700
 He's all tough on the outside, 

08:28.700 --> 08:30.800
but really soft and mushy       
         on the inside.         

08:30.900 --> 08:32.600
Hmm. Not unlike his entire menu.

08:33.900 --> 08:35.100
     Anyway, Sid was always     
         there for me.          

08:35.200 --> 08:37.299
  Not unlike his entire menu.   

08:37.400 --> 08:39.500
                  I remember one
            time, in college,   

08:39.600 --> 08:42.200
      I had to stay up all night
         to finish a term paper.

08:42.299 --> 08:45.400
        Sid stayed up with me   
            till we finished it.

08:45.500 --> 08:47.600
        We also finished        
    a two-pound onion loaf.     

08:48.900 --> 08:51.200
 Well, Norm, I don't blame you  
      for being depressed.      

08:51.300 --> 08:52.300
                No... depressed?

08:52.400 --> 08:53.600
                Come on.        

08:53.700 --> 08:55.800
        You know, life's only   
        temporary anyway, right?

08:55.900 --> 08:58.600
            When you're born,   
        blah-blah-blah, you die.

08:58.700 --> 09:02.900
Geez, Norm, I-I look at you and 
  I see a man at a crossroads.  

09:03.000 --> 09:05.700
  This may be your very first   
     brush with mortality,      

09:05.700 --> 09:08.000
            with the temporal   
            nature of things.   

09:08.000 --> 09:10.900
                    You may feel
                     futile now,

09:11.000 --> 09:12.200
              but there are ways
                 to combat that.

09:12.300 --> 09:14.100
Yeah? How?                      

09:14.200 --> 09:15.800
        Well, by guaranteeing   
        your own immortality.   

09:15.900 --> 09:18.900
            By leaving your mark
                on the world.   

09:19.000 --> 09:20.600
            He always leaves two
             dents on the stool.

09:20.600 --> 09:21.800
                Carla, please.  

09:21.900 --> 09:23.500
                  Well, he does!
                  Big ones, too!

09:23.500 --> 09:24.700
                    When he goes
                  home at night,

09:24.800 --> 09:26.600
                this stool looks
        like it has a Mohawk!   

09:28.200 --> 09:29.500
              Look, I was hoping
                for something   

09:29.600 --> 09:30.800
         a little more          
life-affirming, thank you!      

09:32.600 --> 09:36.200
Now, Norm, there are... there   
     are many roads open to you.

09:36.300 --> 09:38.200
              Geez, you... well,
          you could do something

09:38.200 --> 09:40.700
                to help save the
                  Hungry Heifer.

09:40.800 --> 09:43.000
    Or, well, better yet, you   
         could help do something
            to save yourself!   

09:43.100 --> 09:44.400
        Turn over a new leaf.   

09:44.400 --> 09:46.800
    You could diet, exercise,   
    work for a charitable cause.

09:46.900 --> 09:48.800
                 Or, if you want
                the ultimate way

09:48.800 --> 09:50.400
                 of guaranteeing
            your immortality,   

09:50.500 --> 09:54.200
    go home to Vera and start   
     a family right this minute.

09:55.300 --> 09:59.400
Frasier... you are right.       

09:59.500 --> 10:01.500
    When you're right,          
      you are right!            

10:01.600 --> 10:02.800
    I am gonna do it!           

10:02.900 --> 10:04.200
    (friends shouting           
         encouragement)         

10:04.200 --> 10:06.300
I'm gonna save                  
the Hungry Heifer!              

10:07.800 --> 10:10.800
     Well, what about, uh,      
    dieting, exercise,          

10:10.900 --> 10:12.600
    making a baby with Vera?    

10:12.600 --> 10:13.900
             Pfft!              
        You do it.              

10:24.200 --> 10:26.000
      Hey, Sammy.               
                 Hey.           

10:26.000 --> 10:27.700
          Here you go.          

10:27.800 --> 10:28.700
                            SAM:
                 Enjoy yourself?

10:28.800 --> 10:30.400
Ho-ho, yeah!                    

10:30.400 --> 10:33.200
 I tell you, you haven't lived  
until you've washed a car       

10:33.300 --> 10:35.700
          in front of           
a bunch of drooling cons.       

10:35.800 --> 10:37.100
            (laughs)            
Ooh!                            

10:37.200 --> 10:39.500
  Just like in <i>Cool Hand Luke!</i>  
              Whoo!             

10:39.600 --> 10:40.400
Here you go, Fras.              

10:40.400 --> 10:41.500
        Thank you.              

10:41.500 --> 10:42.800
What do we got here now?        

10:42.900 --> 10:43.900
             Uh, Joe... Marty...

10:43.900 --> 10:45.400
                     Who had the
              powder-blue Caddy?

10:47.200 --> 10:48.600
                 Carla, how's it
                going out there?

10:48.700 --> 10:50.400
      How does Robin look?      
Okay.                           

10:50.500 --> 10:53.800
He was being pushed around by   
this big old hunk of a guard.   

10:53.900 --> 10:56.500
    His name is Vince           
  and he has got some muscles,  

10:56.600 --> 10:58.000
        I'm telling you.        

10:58.100 --> 11:00.900
He could snap Robin's neck      
like a number-two pencil.       

11:01.000 --> 11:03.100
              But he didn't hurt
                Robin, did he?  

11:03.100 --> 11:04.800
        I mean, Robin's okay,   
                 isn't he?      

11:04.800 --> 11:06.000
Yeah, sure, whatever.           

11:06.100 --> 11:07.700
 Anyway, then this, uh, Vince,  

11:07.700 --> 11:10.400
      he gets a load of me      
     and my bucket of suds      

11:10.500 --> 11:11.700
     and he starts flexing.     

11:11.700 --> 11:15.000
          But Robin-- Robin-- he
         gets dehydrated easily.

11:15.100 --> 11:16.100
      Robin, Robin, Robin.      

11:16.100 --> 11:17.900
 So your boyfriend's in prison! 
            Boo-hoo!            

11:18.000 --> 11:20.600
    Can't you be happy          
for someone else for a change?! 

11:23.300 --> 11:24.700
    Hey, don't listen to her.   

11:24.700 --> 11:26.700
             She's trying to get
                under your skin.

11:26.800 --> 11:29.300
         I can see how much this
            must be hurting you.

11:29.400 --> 11:33.100
            Watching the man you
        love out there in the   
                sun all day long

11:33.200 --> 11:34.900
              picking up garbage

11:34.900 --> 11:39.000
        while a whole city looks
      at him, and laughs at him.

11:39.100 --> 11:41.200
        Thanks for              
      understanding, Sam.       
                     Yeah.      

11:43.100 --> 11:44.600
            You really do relish
        this, don't you, Sam?   

11:44.700 --> 11:46.500
Every single minute.            

11:47.900 --> 11:50.700
         Come on, stop          
         moping around.         

11:50.800 --> 11:53.700
  Look, why don't you do what   
any woman would do for her man--

11:53.800 --> 11:57.600
         strip to your skivvies,
         grab a chamois and wash
            a couple of cars.   

11:57.700 --> 11:59.700
             Get your front wet.

12:01.400 --> 12:03.200
I don't think Robin             
would respond                   

12:03.300 --> 12:05.000
to something cheap              
like that.                      

12:05.000 --> 12:06.600
            Oh, yeah? You should
              have seen how fast

12:06.700 --> 12:08.700
                 he stabbed that
            trash when I did it.

12:09.700 --> 12:11.300
FRASIER:                        
Hey, uh, Norm,                  

12:11.400 --> 12:13.400
how's it going with the petition
    to save the Heifer, huh?    

12:13.500 --> 12:16.300
    Great. Got a hundred more   
          signatures back there.
Hey, all right.                 

12:16.400 --> 12:18.600
  Although I am getting a little
          bit of writer's cramp.

12:18.700 --> 12:21.900
    Well, I wish you            
    luck, Mr. P.                
                        Yeah?   

12:22.000 --> 12:24.900
  I know how hard it is to get  
people to sign a petition.      

12:25.000 --> 12:27.100
                Yeah, I remember
              back in Hanover...

12:27.200 --> 12:30.100
    I tried to gather signatures
  to rebuild the town band shell

12:30.200 --> 12:32.300
                after the Fourth
              of July explosion.

12:32.400 --> 12:35.000
         I had a heck of a time.

12:35.100 --> 12:37.200
             I couldn't even get
        my Uncle Elwood to sign.

12:37.300 --> 12:39.800
Oh. Couldn't even               
convince your uncle, huh?       

12:39.900 --> 12:41.600
        Oh, he was convinced.   

12:41.600 --> 12:43.000
                He just couldn't
                grip the pen.   

12:43.000 --> 12:44.600
                    See, he was,
                he was in charge

12:44.700 --> 12:46.800
of lighting                     
the fireworks.                  

12:46.900 --> 12:48.600
            They had extra small
    fuses that year. No-no...   

12:48.700 --> 12:51.500
            Time to pound       
            the pavement.       

12:51.500 --> 12:53.200
         If I get like          
a hundred more signatures,      

12:53.200 --> 12:55.300
I can bring this petition       
    over to City Hall.          

12:55.300 --> 12:56.600
         Good for you.          

12:56.700 --> 12:58.900
    Frasier, you were           
    absolutely right.           

12:59.000 --> 13:00.800
    This feels right.           
    This feels great.           

13:00.800 --> 13:02.500
  It's been a long time since   

13:02.500 --> 13:03.700
I pounded the bricks            

13:03.800 --> 13:05.600
          for a cause.          

13:10.600 --> 13:13.200
    Oh I can't stand thinking   
              of Robin out there

13:13.300 --> 13:15.200
in the blazing sun.             

13:15.300 --> 13:16.500
        Aw, honey, well,        
      I'll tell you what,       

13:16.600 --> 13:19.000
let me, uh, let me put on       
      a song here for you,      

13:19.100 --> 13:20.900
 take your mind off of things.  

13:21.000 --> 13:22.600
No, Sam, that's                 
not gonna work.                 

13:22.700 --> 13:23.900
            All right, go ahead.
                It doesn't...   

13:23.900 --> 13:27.400
     ¶ ...situation thought     
     I could take them... ¶     

13:27.500 --> 13:30.200
Dang it, Sam, turn it off.      

13:30.300 --> 13:32.100
    ¶ For a while, baby...      

13:32.100 --> 13:34.500
  Is that your idea of a song   
that's gonna cheer me up?       

13:34.500 --> 13:36.100
Well, hey, it's got             
a great beat.                   

13:36.200 --> 13:38.000
It's easy to pick               
up trash to.                    

13:38.000 --> 13:40.800
    You just can go on          
with your stupid little idiotic 

13:40.900 --> 13:43.000
           nasty jokes          
     because you know what?     

13:43.100 --> 13:45.900
I love Robin and I'm going      
    to remain loyal to him,     

13:46.000 --> 13:47.200
like it says right there,       

13:47.300 --> 13:50.700
      B-14, "Stand By Your Man."

13:50.700 --> 13:54.900
¶ I'm just sitting here in... ¶ 

13:55.000 --> 13:58.200
  ¶ For a while, baby, I never  
thought I could wait... ¶       

13:59.600 --> 14:02.200
    ¶ I'm just sitting here     
            in... ¶             

14:02.300 --> 14:07.300
  ¶ For a while, baby, I never  
thought I could wait... ¶       

14:11.100 --> 14:12.700
     Cliff, you want to go      
    shoot some stick?           

14:12.800 --> 14:14.800
                Let's shoot some
                  stick, Doctor.

14:14.800 --> 14:16.500
     Oh, hey, before you go     
     back there, Dr. Crane,     

14:16.600 --> 14:18.400
     I should tell you that     
    Carla's keeping a guard     

14:18.400 --> 14:19.500
    on the pool table.          

14:19.600 --> 14:20.700
Why is she doing that?          

14:20.800 --> 14:22.000
     I guess she likes him.     

14:26.400 --> 14:27.400
     Afternoon, everybody.      

14:27.500 --> 14:29.100
              ALL:              
             Norm!              

14:29.200 --> 14:31.200
     Hey, how would a beer      
      feel, Mr. Peterson?       

14:31.300 --> 14:33.900
            Pretty nervous if   
              I was in the room.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.600
             In fact, let me buy
     a beer for everybody, okay?

14:36.700 --> 14:38.700
        All right!              
        Thank you, Norm!        

14:38.700 --> 14:40.800
              Guys, I have saved
              the Hungry Heifer.

14:40.900 --> 14:43.200
         (all cheering)         

14:43.300 --> 14:44.600
That's great.                   
How'd you do it?                

14:44.700 --> 14:47.600
            Well, I went over to
        City Hall to drop off   
             the petition right?

14:47.700 --> 14:49.600
                Stopped in to do
              a little research.

14:49.700 --> 14:51.700
            It turns out that   
            the Hungry Heifer   

14:51.700 --> 14:54.400
     is the only building on the
         entire Eastern Seaboard

14:54.500 --> 14:57.500
    that has a giant red-eyed   
steam-snorting bull on the roof.

14:57.500 --> 14:59.300
  What about Hub's Steak Hut?   

14:59.400 --> 15:00.600
                      It's gone.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.300
      Well, Lucky Chucky's      
          Chuck House?          

15:02.400 --> 15:03.600
            Struck by lightning.

15:03.700 --> 15:04.900
Bill's Place for Steak?         

15:04.900 --> 15:06.100
                         Stolen.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.500
      Wow. That really is       
    the end of an era.          

15:08.600 --> 15:11.400
Yeah.                           
Wonder who's next.              

15:11.400 --> 15:13.600
Are they gonna take down        
those big buckets of chicken?   

15:13.700 --> 15:15.600
There's a message in            
this for the Big Boy:           

15:15.700 --> 15:18.200
get rid of those overalls       
and get a real job.             

15:18.300 --> 15:19.900
Yeah. You know who doesn't      
         have to worry?         

15:20.000 --> 15:21.300
             Denny.             

15:21.400 --> 15:23.100
          Nobody knows          
      what he looks like.       

15:25.700 --> 15:27.800
 Oh, sorry, was that out loud?  

15:31.300 --> 15:32.500
                        NORM:   
                Anyway, the city
                    planner's   

15:32.600 --> 15:34.200
                office issued   
          a temporary injunction

15:34.200 --> 15:35.900
          against any demolition

15:36.000 --> 15:38.100
      until it can be determined
    whether the Hungry Heifer   

15:38.200 --> 15:39.800
                 can be declared
            a roadside landmark.

15:39.900 --> 15:41.600
Oh, congratulations, Norm.      

15:41.600 --> 15:43.300
                Gentlemen, start
                your enzymes.   

15:43.300 --> 15:45.100
          (chanting):           
    Norm. Norm. Norm.           

15:45.200 --> 15:47.700
         Norm. Norm...          
            Yeah, yeah, yeah.   

15:47.800 --> 15:51.600
I'm gonna invite you guys all   
to the Hungry Heifer tonight.   

15:51.700 --> 15:54.800
 Well, what was supposed to be  
  a sad little farewell dinner  

15:54.900 --> 15:58.700
is gonna turn into the happiest 
 meal of Mr. Sid Nelson's life. 

15:58.800 --> 16:00.500
Everyone's gonna be there, guys.

16:00.600 --> 16:01.900
  Even the Big Eaters Circle.   

16:02.000 --> 16:02.900
             You in that, Mr. P?

16:02.900 --> 16:05.300
Oh, no, no, Woody, please.      

16:05.400 --> 16:06.700
    This is a closed table.     

16:06.800 --> 16:09.300
I mean, someone has to die      
before you can get a seat there.

16:09.400 --> 16:10.300
                Wow, too bad.   

16:10.400 --> 16:12.100
Oh, no. These guys              
drop dead                       

16:12.100 --> 16:13.100
    like once a week.           

16:13.100 --> 16:15.000
      I've got a real shot      
        at it, I think.         

16:17.300 --> 16:18.800
              Say, honey, I hate
        to bother you, you know,

16:18.800 --> 16:20.200
         with Robin on your mind
                 and everything,

16:20.300 --> 16:21.900
            but I just bought   
            some new clothes.   

16:21.900 --> 16:23.100
              I'd like a woman's
                  point of view.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.200
     Fine. Let's see them.      

16:24.200 --> 16:25.600
         Hit it, Fras.          

16:29.900 --> 16:31.100
 Our model, Sam, is sporting    

16:31.200 --> 16:32.500
the latest in "big house" chic. 

16:35.500 --> 16:37.400
                This ensemble   

16:37.500 --> 16:39.100
                      is equally
                     appropriate

16:39.200 --> 16:41.500
for playing the harmonica       
    or just crushing rocks.     

16:41.600 --> 16:43.300
 It comes complete with anklet  

16:43.400 --> 16:45.000
and matching                    
trash ka-bob,                   

16:45.100 --> 16:46.300
                 made popular by
        billionaire swindler,   

16:46.300 --> 16:49.200
    Robin Colcord.              

16:49.300 --> 16:51.600
  You think you're hilarious,   
        don't you, Sam?         

16:51.600 --> 16:53.700
    Well, I bring the party     
    with me, don't I, babe?     

16:55.400 --> 16:57.100
Optional with this outfit       
is a matching set of,           

16:57.200 --> 17:00.300
uh, tattoos reading:            
"Born to Raise Hell"            

17:00.400 --> 17:03.500
and, uh, "It's                  
Society's Fault."               

17:03.600 --> 17:07.200
 You guys, don't encourage him. 

17:07.200 --> 17:08.400
            Guys, guys, guys,   
                look at this.   

17:08.400 --> 17:09.900
                Quick impression
            of Robin Colcord.   

17:09.900 --> 17:11.400
    (British accent):           
            Blimey.             

17:11.500 --> 17:14.800
     There's a lot of trash     
  on the ground, isn't there?   

17:14.900 --> 17:18.200
  Well, I'll just have to impale
it and flush it down the loo.   

17:19.500 --> 17:20.700
                            Cor.

17:20.800 --> 17:21.900
 Look, it's all over the place. 

17:22.000 --> 17:23.900
  Look at that. Look at that.   
         Look at that.          

17:25.300 --> 17:26.900
            All right, that's   
                it. Let's go.   

17:26.900 --> 17:28.500
             You're spending the
            night in the box.   

17:28.700 --> 17:29.500
    (laughing)                  

17:29.600 --> 17:30.800
                     What're you
             talking about, man?

17:30.900 --> 17:31.900
Hey, what're you doing?         

17:31.900 --> 17:33.200
I'm not one of                  
your prisoners.                 

17:33.300 --> 17:35.100
                 I know, but you
                stabbed my foot.

17:35.200 --> 17:36.600
                And I got a gun.

17:36.700 --> 17:38.900
              So you're spending
        the night in the box.   

17:39.000 --> 17:40.400
    It was an accident.         

17:40.500 --> 17:42.600
I didn't mean... Guys, do       
 something, will you, Rebecca?  

17:42.600 --> 17:43.900
                      Okay, Sam.

17:43.900 --> 17:46.000
  ¶ I'm just sitting here... ¶  

17:46.000 --> 17:48.400
        Oh, great.              

17:48.500 --> 17:50.300
      She's got a problem.      

17:59.100 --> 18:02.000
                Okay, all right.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.300
            Attention please.   
                    (banging)   

18:03.400 --> 18:05.300
    Attention please.           

18:05.300 --> 18:07.900
      Okay, before we get       
        to the ceremony,        

18:07.900 --> 18:10.000
        I'd like to make        
     a little announcement.     

18:10.100 --> 18:12.300
      Because of tonight's      
     very special occasion,     

18:12.400 --> 18:15.700
  the fudge volcano will keep   
  erupting for one more hour.   

18:15.800 --> 18:20.200
    (cheering and applause)     

18:20.200 --> 18:22.800
 All right, there we go, yeah.  

18:22.900 --> 18:24.000
             Okay.              

18:24.100 --> 18:26.400
     The Big Eaters Circle.     
        All right.              

18:27.800 --> 18:30.500
Now, I'd like to introduce      
         to you folks,          

18:30.600 --> 18:33.500
     the owner and operator     
     of the Hungry Heifer,      

18:33.500 --> 18:37.600
our very special guest,         
Mr. Sid Nelson.                 

18:37.600 --> 18:38.700
        (cheering)              

18:38.800 --> 18:40.400
          (chanting):           
      Sid. Sid. Sid. Sid.       

18:40.400 --> 18:41.500
         Sid. Sid. Sid.         

18:41.600 --> 18:42.800
          Sid. Sid...           

18:42.800 --> 18:44.600
Let me get right                
to the point, Sid.              

18:44.700 --> 18:48.300
I knew you were expecting       
a tearful farewell              
dinner here tonight,            

18:48.400 --> 18:49.900
but, uh, that is                
not going to happen.            

18:50.000 --> 18:51.500
  What are you talking about?   

18:51.600 --> 18:54.300
Well, the Hungry Heifer is      
not going to be torn down.      

18:54.300 --> 18:56.100
  What are you talking about?   

18:56.200 --> 18:57.200
                        NORM:   
                    Perhaps this
                  piece of paper

18:57.300 --> 18:59.300
will help explain               
things, Sid.                    

18:59.300 --> 19:01.700
This is an injunction,          

19:01.700 --> 19:04.800
making the Hungry Heifer        
immune to any wrecking ball.    

19:04.900 --> 19:07.500
It will be here for our children
and our children's children.    

19:13.500 --> 19:16.600
Sid obviously wasn't prepared   
            for this happy news.

19:16.700 --> 19:18.700
    Uh, tell you what, uh...    

19:18.800 --> 19:20.800
    have the band strike up     
      another tune, okay?       

19:20.900 --> 19:22.100
    Oh, the band felt           
    bloated and left.           

19:22.100 --> 19:24.000
  You've got to pace yourself.  

19:24.000 --> 19:25.900
        Sid.                    

19:27.700 --> 19:29.500
Sid, what are you doing?.       

19:29.600 --> 19:31.100
You could start                 
a grease fire in here.          

19:31.200 --> 19:33.000
I mean, I know you              
have them every day,            

19:33.100 --> 19:35.800
but this one could              
get out of hand.                

19:35.800 --> 19:37.900
                You jerk. You   
              ruined everything.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.400
But I thought                   
you'd be happy.                 

19:40.500 --> 19:42.300
            Happy? Why should   
                     I be happy?

19:42.300 --> 19:45.700
    The developers were going   
          to give me three times
    what this joint is worth.   

19:45.700 --> 19:47.800
I didn't know you wanted        
out of this place, Sid.         

19:47.900 --> 19:49.300
        Why?                    

19:49.300 --> 19:52.000
        How would you like to   
         spend seven days a week

19:52.100 --> 19:54.000
            up to your elbows   
                in cow flesh?   

19:54.100 --> 19:57.200
Sid, I never knew               
you felt this way.              

19:57.200 --> 19:59.200
          Well, I didn't always.

19:59.300 --> 20:02.700
              But, I don't know,
         this is the '90s, Norm.

20:02.800 --> 20:05.400
             We've learned a lot
    about the kind of poisons   

20:05.500 --> 20:08.200
              we've been putting
                into our bodies.

20:08.300 --> 20:09.500
     Now, you look at that.     

20:09.600 --> 20:11.800
      You see some T-bones      
    and a rump roast.           

20:11.900 --> 20:13.800
      I see a loaded gun.       

20:13.900 --> 20:18.200
    I've been carrying it around
  with me for a long time, Norm,

20:18.300 --> 20:23.400
the guilt for what I've been    
doing to bodies like yours.     

20:25.700 --> 20:28.500
I thought I had a way out.      

20:28.600 --> 20:31.400
I could sell the place to the,  
to the lube syndicate.          

20:31.500 --> 20:33.600
But... I guess the only         
way out for me now              

20:33.600 --> 20:35.500
is just to torch the place.     

20:35.600 --> 20:37.600
    Hey, no, no, you can't...   

20:37.700 --> 20:40.500
    Sid, you cannot burn down   
              the Hungry Heifer.

20:40.500 --> 20:43.000
Yeah. I guess                   
you're right.                   

20:43.100 --> 20:44.500
                 Yeah.          

20:44.500 --> 20:47.100
I'd be the first one            
they'd suspect.                 

20:47.200 --> 20:49.600
But who am I gonna get          
to do it for me, Norm?          

20:49.700 --> 20:50.800
I've got no family.             

20:50.800 --> 20:52.500
Who's gonna light               
the match for me.               

20:52.600 --> 20:54.200
I've got no son.                

20:54.200 --> 20:56.400
You're the one who came         
closest to that for me.         

20:56.500 --> 20:59.100
            Thank you, Sid.     

20:59.200 --> 21:01.600
Light the match.                

21:01.600 --> 21:02.600
          No, no. There's no way

21:02.700 --> 21:04.300
            I'm gonna let you go
          through with this. No.

21:04.400 --> 21:07.200
I'm an old man, Norm.           

21:07.300 --> 21:09.100
I've got nothing                
to look forward to.             

21:09.100 --> 21:10.800
Light the match.                

21:10.800 --> 21:15.100
            Look, there's no way
            I'm gonna let you go
              through with this.

21:15.100 --> 21:18.000
          Hey, you mean too much
            to me, all right?   

21:18.100 --> 21:22.900
            I mean... look, I   
              never said this...

21:22.900 --> 21:24.600
            to my own father,   

21:24.700 --> 21:27.200
    but I... I love you, Sid.   

21:27.300 --> 21:34.100
Hey, I didn't know              
you felt like that, Norm.       
                Yeah.           

21:34.200 --> 21:35.400
Gee, I love you, too.           

21:35.400 --> 21:36.400
              Thank you, Sid.   

21:36.500 --> 21:37.600
Light the match.                

21:37.700 --> 21:40.200
             Would you stop with
            the matches, Sid?   

21:40.300 --> 21:41.800
              Just stop with it.

21:45.600 --> 21:48.300
        So, Sid finally         
    came around, huh?           

21:48.400 --> 21:50.400
  Yeah. You bet he did. Yeah.   
WOODY:                          
How'd you convince him?         

21:50.500 --> 21:52.500
Well, I told him he could serve 
    a healthier menu,           

21:52.600 --> 21:53.900
        uh, smaller portions,   

21:53.900 --> 21:55.300
      leaner cuts of beef.      

21:55.400 --> 21:57.700
  He's actually gonna put some  
    greens in the salad bar.    

21:57.800 --> 21:59.400
                  Oh.           
            You know we could   
                 change the name

21:59.500 --> 22:00.700
     to the Healthy Heifer.     

22:00.800 --> 22:02.100
                        Yeah.   

22:02.100 --> 22:04.700
        I think I really turned 
         his life around today. 

22:04.800 --> 22:06.100
    What the hell...?           

22:06.100 --> 22:08.300
                Sid... Sid!     

22:08.300 --> 22:09.800
            What's going on?    

22:09.900 --> 22:12.300
    This is Gus, the busboy.    

22:12.400 --> 22:14.300
 Now <i>he's</i> the son I never had.  

22:15.200 --> 22:16.400
                Fire!           

22:16.500 --> 22:18.600
    Fire!
