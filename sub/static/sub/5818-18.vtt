00:02.160 --> 00:03.321
Previously on The Vampire Diaries...

00:03.560 --> 00:07.406
My name is Alexandria St. John.
I'm your family, Lorenzo.

00:07.600 --> 00:09.011
Here's what I know about the pills.

00:09.200 --> 00:10.964
They're really only useful
if you wanna fight a witch.

00:11.160 --> 00:12.161
What about the antidote?

00:12.360 --> 00:13.361
We tried to create the antidote

00:13.520 --> 00:14.646
-and we failed.
- What?

00:14.840 --> 00:16.046
Who could you have been giving them to?

00:16.680 --> 00:18.887
Give Bonnie Bennett my regards.

00:19.160 --> 00:21.686
Everyone you know has made the choice
that serves them best.

00:21.880 --> 00:23.484
Why not make a choice that serves you?

00:24.800 --> 00:25.926
(GRUNTS)

00:26.120 --> 00:28.009
NORA: I love you.
MARY: I love you.

00:29.680 --> 00:30.681
(SCREAMING)

00:30.920 --> 00:33.890
When you destroyed the Phoenix Stone,
all the souls inside escaped.

00:34.080 --> 00:35.081
The spirits fled

00:35.240 --> 00:36.890
into the first dead piece of flesh
they could find.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.367
Cut the crap, buddy.
I know that you're not Stefan.

00:39.600 --> 00:42.524
RIC: Apparently, he was a serial killer
before he became a vampire.

00:42.720 --> 00:45.451
He would stalk sororities and fraternities
and murder for sport.

00:45.640 --> 00:46.971
Where did Stefan go?

00:47.160 --> 00:49.208
He could be anywhere. He could be anyone.

00:49.440 --> 00:52.967
I got ripped out of hell
and thrown into a dead man's body.

00:53.160 --> 00:56.562
This is not how you are going to die,
Stefan Salvatore.

00:56.760 --> 01:00.128
Buckle up. We have less than 48 hours
to track down your real body.

01:13.920 --> 01:16.241
Stef. Hey, Stef.

01:20.480 --> 01:21.481
What happened?

01:21.720 --> 01:24.405
Well, I pulled your ass out of the snow,
you ate a bunch of donuts,

01:24.640 --> 01:27.166
and then you puked blood
all over my nice clean car.

01:27.960 --> 01:29.246
You said everything hurt.

01:31.320 --> 01:34.164
So, I got you everything.
Head stuff, throat stuff, stomach stuff.

01:34.400 --> 01:36.129
God! Where are we?

01:36.360 --> 01:37.361
DAMON: On our way to Memphis.

01:37.520 --> 01:40.330
Valerie got a line on your real body,
the one with the nice hair.

01:40.520 --> 01:42.010
How did my real body end up in Memphis?

01:42.240 --> 01:43.651
You know what? Long story.

01:44.040 --> 01:46.168
Why don't you just focus
on stayin' alive, okay?

01:46.360 --> 01:50.001
Sit back, relax, find your happy place,
chug one of those five-hour energy drinks,

01:50.200 --> 01:52.089
maybe with a cough syrup chaser
or something.

01:52.280 --> 01:53.281
(RETCHING)

01:57.280 --> 01:59.726
-(G ROANS)
- Okay. Plan B.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.804
- What are you doing?
-(LINE RINGING)

02:06.000 --> 02:07.411
DISPATCH ER:
911, what's your emergency?

02:07.640 --> 02:09.847
Damon, I can't go to a hospital.

02:10.039 --> 02:12.691
Marty Hammond got loaded
and crashed a bus full of kids.

02:12.880 --> 02:14.370
There's an interstate manhunt going on.

02:14.560 --> 02:15.686
Don't worry, brother.

02:15.880 --> 02:19.726
I'm not taking you to a hospital.
I'm bringing the hospital to us.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.921
I had to improvise.
The over-the-counter stuff wasn't working.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.808
That's Frank and that's Sully. Hi, guys.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.001
- How you doing?
- Hey.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.282
I've asked them very politely
to make sure that Marty stays alive,

02:45.480 --> 02:48.290
and if he doesn't,
then I will cut their thumbs off

02:48.520 --> 02:50.443
and feed them to the squirrels.
Right, guys?

02:51.960 --> 02:53.928
Meanwhile, you and I
will go hunt down the sociopath

02:54.120 --> 02:55.485
that has taken residence in my brother,

02:55.680 --> 02:59.480
and then Valerie
will jam his real soul back in--

03:01.400 --> 03:02.401
DAMON: Where's my witch?

03:02.600 --> 03:05.080
She's at a motel off Route 70,
prepping for the spell.

03:05.280 --> 03:06.691
"Prepping for the spell"?
What does that even mean?

03:06.920 --> 03:08.001
What could she possibly have to prep?

03:08.200 --> 03:10.089
I guess it's a little more complicated
than that.

03:10.280 --> 03:12.009
At any rate, she managed
to do a locator spell

03:12.200 --> 03:14.328
on the serial killer in Stefan's body.

03:14.600 --> 03:15.601
His name is Ambrose.

03:16.040 --> 03:18.771
Turns out, he's holed up in a frat house
near Memphis College.

03:18.960 --> 03:21.486
Maybe he'll be so busy
snacking on drunk sorority girls,

03:21.720 --> 03:23.210
this will be an easy smash and grab.

03:23.400 --> 03:26.244
Listen, thanks for coming all this way
to help out, buddy. Means a lot.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.681
Yeah, well,
I didn't exactly volunteer, Damon.

03:28.880 --> 03:30.120
Valerie sort of ambushed me.

03:30.320 --> 03:32.368
You know, she probably thought
that you'd feel good

03:32.600 --> 03:33.965
about stepping up for an old friend,

03:34.160 --> 03:36.003
especially since you're planning
on marrying his ex.

03:36.200 --> 03:37.531
You're sure this is
how you want to play it, Damon?

03:37.880 --> 03:39.962
You know, maybe
you bought Marty an hour or so,

03:41.320 --> 03:43.368
but, you know,
when the same thing happened to Jo...

03:44.160 --> 03:46.288
I don't know, maybe you wanna consider
spending your remaining time

03:46.480 --> 03:48.847
just being with your brother.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.727
Did you seriouslyjust suggest
that I spend the afternoon

03:52.960 --> 03:55.930
saying a sappy goodbye to Stefan
instead of saving his life?

04:00.520 --> 04:01.521
Getting soft, Ric.

04:01.760 --> 04:05.287
More than soft.
Your brain's liquefied. Get in.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
The thing is,

04:18.000 --> 04:20.844
I cared about him
more than anyone else in the world,

04:21.160 --> 04:22.161
but it wasn't enough.

04:22.360 --> 04:23.691
I mean, he walked away,

04:24.840 --> 04:26.683
like it was the easiest thing
in the world to do.

04:27.840 --> 04:31.765
And then I find out he's back
and hasn't bothered to contact me.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.287
I think how could I have fallen
into such a dark place

04:34.480 --> 04:37.051
over someone who cares so little about me?

04:40.120 --> 04:41.849
I decided I'm ready to move on.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.521
I'm not gonna let that betrayal
define the rest of my life.

04:45.120 --> 04:47.202
Thank you, Bonnie. Nice progress.

04:50.160 --> 04:52.686
Virginia? Did you have something
you wanted to share?

04:55.680 --> 04:56.886
No.

04:58.360 --> 05:00.408
DAMON: So what did I miss when
I was gone? What's been happening?

05:00.880 --> 05:01.881
I wouldn't know.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.884
Oh, come on. Maybe you buried your head
in a Dallas sandbox,

05:05.120 --> 05:07.646
but your wife-to-be, she's always
had her nose in everyone's business

05:07.840 --> 05:09.251
which is why I find it hard to believe

05:09.480 --> 05:12.563
that she wouldn't drop some details
about her best friend

05:12.800 --> 05:14.882
over string cheese and chicken nuggets.

05:15.160 --> 05:17.481
Look, Damon, if you're fishing
for information about Bonnie,

05:17.680 --> 05:18.920
I suggest you go straight to the source.

05:19.160 --> 05:22.050
I totally would, but she didn't leave
a forwarding address at my storage unit.

05:23.560 --> 05:24.561
Ah, it doesn't matter.

05:24.760 --> 05:27.411
It'll give Carebear and I
something to talk about at the reception.

05:27.720 --> 05:30.724
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, well, we're not actually
having a big wedding thing.

05:30.920 --> 05:31.921
Just a few friends.

05:32.080 --> 05:33.525
Since when do you have friends besides me?

05:33.720 --> 05:35.165
We made new ones.

05:36.760 --> 05:38.762
Look, I know this has been
just a cat nap for you, Damon,

05:39.000 --> 05:40.889
but it's been three years
in the real world.

05:41.080 --> 05:43.048
People change. Life goes on.

05:43.280 --> 05:44.281
It wasn't a cat nap, Ric.

05:44.440 --> 05:47.728
I made an excruciatingly painful descent
into a near-death state,

05:47.920 --> 05:49.524
so I wouldn't destroy
everyone that I loved.

05:49.720 --> 05:51.688
You know what? Now that we know
where Ambrose is all camped out,

05:51.880 --> 05:53.120
I think that I'll get back to my life now.

05:53.280 --> 05:55.726
So, if you don't mind taking me
to the airport or a train station

05:55.920 --> 05:59.402
or even this bus stop coming up here,
yeah, if you want to pull over and...

05:59.600 --> 06:00.601
There it goes.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.205
Look, I get you're mad, okay?

06:02.400 --> 06:03.925
I shouldn't have said goodbye in a letter.

06:04.120 --> 06:05.929
I should have flown to Dallas
and taken you out for a drink,

06:06.120 --> 06:07.929
some line-dancing,
and told you face to face.

06:08.120 --> 06:10.122
I'm very sorry, Ric.
Just let me make it up to you.

06:10.280 --> 06:12.089
Oh, you know, Damon,
I'm really not interested

06:12.280 --> 06:14.601
in being part
of your 12-step redemption tour.

06:14.800 --> 06:17.280
One more mission for old times' sake.

06:18.200 --> 06:20.567
I can assure you
that saving my little brother

06:20.760 --> 06:21.761
would be much more fun

06:21.960 --> 06:23.325
than putting together
old broken-up baby dolls.

06:23.560 --> 06:26.803
Yeah, well, I'm not really a big fan
of your brother right now, either.

06:27.880 --> 06:30.645
He broke Caroline's heart
when he abandoned her.

06:32.160 --> 06:33.491
Worked out pretty well for you, didn't it?

06:37.240 --> 06:38.241
Huh?

06:38.480 --> 06:41.404
Oh, come on, help me out. Be a hero.

06:41.600 --> 06:42.647
I mean, unless you don't think

06:42.800 --> 06:44.848
Caroline cares
whether Stefan lives or dies.

06:49.960 --> 06:51.849
(MEDICAL MONITOR BEEPING)

07:11.520 --> 07:12.681
Where's your girl tonight?

07:13.960 --> 07:14.961
My Qirl?

07:15.440 --> 07:18.523
Valerie. Tall, pretty. Likes her drinks
with the little pink umbrellas.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.360
Or do you have more than one?

07:20.520 --> 07:23.046
Oh, no, no, no. Just one.

07:24.520 --> 07:26.170
BARTENDER: Need any help?
What are you trying to write?

07:26.360 --> 07:27.361
An apOIOQY-

07:27.960 --> 07:31.601
"I wish that things were different,
but it's safer this way.

07:32.880 --> 07:34.370
"I never meant to hurt you

07:34.880 --> 07:37.360
"and I wish you
all the happiness in the world."

07:38.200 --> 07:39.281
Well, sounds good to me.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.123
She returns all of them unopened.

07:43.720 --> 07:45.210
Maybe this is the one she'll read.

07:46.680 --> 07:47.806
Right.

07:54.720 --> 07:56.006
Everything okay, buddy?

07:59.360 --> 08:01.488
Do you have a piece of paper and a pen?

08:02.080 --> 08:04.731
I need to write a letter
in case I don't make it out of this.

08:10.840 --> 08:15.209
CROWD: (CHANTING)
Chug. Chug. Chug. Chug.

08:15.400 --> 08:18.483
Chug. Chug. Chug. Chug.

08:18.760 --> 08:21.604
(CROWD CHEERING)

08:32.159 --> 08:34.686
Damon! I was wondering if you'd show up.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.248
Come in, friend. Have a drink.

08:39.760 --> 08:40.760
Oh, dear.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.884
Looks like you're a pledge
who didn't make the cut.

08:43.440 --> 08:48.207
I guess now you'll just have to slog
through a bit of old-fashioned hazing.

08:59.120 --> 09:02.602
Okay, so, I couldn't get
past the threshold.

09:02.800 --> 09:03.801
You're on deck.

09:04.280 --> 09:05.281
I got you a disguise.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.446
Here, put that on. You can go
as the creepy professor

09:08.640 --> 09:09.641
pretending to chaperone.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.962
I booked a 5:15 into Dallas/Fort Worth,

09:12.480 --> 09:13.891
even used my miles.

09:14.880 --> 09:16.769
You're not fooling anyone, Ric.
You know that?

09:16.960 --> 09:19.327
You leveled a rifle on me
when I showed up at your house.

09:19.480 --> 09:20.561
I know you're still in the game.

09:20.760 --> 09:23.604
I'm not in the game because I possess
the means to protect my family

09:23.800 --> 09:26.246
from some uninvited lurker.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.124
It's my brother's life
we're talking about here, Rick.

09:28.320 --> 09:30.004
If you're not gonna do it for me,
at least do it for the guy

09:30.160 --> 09:33.004
who stepped aside
and made this perfect happy life,

09:33.240 --> 09:35.766
that you're just dying
to get back to, possible.

09:35.960 --> 09:36.961
(KNOCKING ON GLASS)

09:42.600 --> 09:44.250
- Yeah.
- Are you Damon Salvatore?

09:44.680 --> 09:45.966
Well, that depends on who's asking.

09:46.160 --> 09:48.731
He said if you don't answer this,
I'm supposed to run into traffic.

09:48.960 --> 09:50.121
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

09:50.360 --> 09:51.486
I'm answering.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.483
So I hear your vampire MO is payback
for you being a Greek system reject.

09:58.680 --> 10:00.011
Kind of cliché, don't you think?

10:00.840 --> 10:02.205
Why don't you come on back here, Damon?

10:02.360 --> 10:06.649
I'm sure I can remember which attractive,
over-privileged parasite owns this place.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.049
Huh. Well, the only parasite
I'm interested in is you.

10:10.200 --> 10:12.885
You, know, I actually don't care much
for the taste of blood.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.890
What I do love are the less obvious perks.

10:16.040 --> 10:19.203
Eavesdropping skills, mind games.

10:19.360 --> 10:22.603
Of course, it's fun to wantonly murder
these class-obsessed imbeciles,

10:22.840 --> 10:26.561
but making them kill each other,
that really takes the egg.

10:26.880 --> 10:29.087
This is all fascinating, really.
Here's the thing.

10:29.320 --> 10:30.401
I can't hear you that well,

10:30.560 --> 10:31.891
and I don't think
the reception's that good.

10:32.040 --> 10:33.201
Why don't you just come out

10:33.400 --> 10:36.768
and deliver your villainous monologue
face to face? What do you think?

10:37.040 --> 10:40.249
Damon, I know you won't leave me alone
until you get your brother's body back.

10:40.440 --> 10:43.728
So why don't you do me one small favor
and we both get what we want.

10:43.880 --> 10:44.881
How small?

10:46.720 --> 10:47.721
Rayna Cruz.

10:48.040 --> 10:49.963
She chased me across this country
for a decade,

10:50.200 --> 10:53.249
made my life hell, literally.
Yours too, I hear.

10:53.400 --> 10:54.401
What about her?

10:54.560 --> 10:57.245
Well, let’s just say
I've made things personal with her,

10:57.400 --> 10:59.368
framed her for a couple of massacres,

11:00.560 --> 11:01.766
turned her boyfriend.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.050
She won't be satisfied until I'm dead.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.448
In fact, she's probably
on her way over here, right now.

11:06.720 --> 11:09.246
So, why don't you go ahead
and kill her for me,

11:09.480 --> 11:13.087
and I promise I will turn
your brother's body back over to you.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.924
DAMON: And why would you do that?

23:55.680 --> 23:58.206
You ever hear of a vampire hunter
named Rayna Cruz?

23:58.520 --> 24:02.206
They used her blood
to make the pills I've been taking.

you'll be free to walk away.

24:05.880 --> 24:07.041

it's the dumpster for me then.

This isn't a matter

24:49.400 --> 24:51.926
You stole those pills
and gave them to someone you care about.

24:52.560 --> 24:54.244
You know what would be a terrible shame?

24:54.400 --> 24:56.164
Is if that person were a witch.

24:56.480 --> 24:58.642
Say, Bonnie Bennett,

25:03.720 --> 25:05.802

you just gave the girl you love

what I need to know.

There's a vault
in the basement of the Armory.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.848
It was sealed by a Bennett witch
a long time ago

27:17.040 --> 27:18.883
and only a Bennett witch can unlock it.

27:19.040 --> 27:20.041
So, they want me to open a vault?

27:20.240 --> 27:21.401
As far as my family knew,

27:21.560 --> 27:23.562
Lucy Bennett was
the only living witch in your line,

27:23.720 --> 27:25.404
and she disappeared about four years ago,

27:25.560 --> 27:27.369
I'm not sure why we didn't know about you.

27:27.560 --> 27:29.244
Well, I was officially dead for a while.

27:29.480 --> 27:31.528
Then lwasn't. Long story.

Gonna need you to be
a little more specific.

27:39.920 --> 27:42.526
First, you have to swear
that you'll never open it.

I suppose there's something about
standing on the precipice of death

40:00.320 --> 40:01.321
(ENZO SIGHS)

40:04.640 --> 40:06.802
- What's wrong?
- You can't take these anymore, love.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.764
I got a lead, not all the answers.

40:08.960 --> 40:10.485
I still need to stay
off the Armory's radar--

40:10.760 --> 40:12.489
The pills are making you sick.

40:13.640 --> 40:15.608
What are you talking about? I feel fine.

40:15.800 --> 40:16.801
Okay.

40:18.520 --> 40:21.683
I didn't know,
but the Armory was experimenting

40:21.840 --> 40:22.841
on Mary Louise.

40:26.360 --> 40:28.601
They forced these pills
down her throat every day

40:28.800 --> 40:30.529
for the past three years, and as a result,

40:30.680 --> 40:31.920
she became very,

40:33.360 --> 40:34.361
very ill.

40:35.120 --> 40:36.690
I thought she blew herself up.

40:38.680 --> 40:40.648
It's because she knew she was dying.

40:43.040 --> 40:45.884
Look, I'm so sorry.

40:46.160 --> 40:47.605
I thought I was protecting you.

40:47.840 --> 40:48.841
I'm gonna die?

40:50.360 --> 40:52.010
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

40:52.880 --> 40:55.850
Because I've done it once or twice before,
and it's not all that fun.

40:56.040 --> 40:58.361
No. I will not let that happen.

41:00.520 --> 41:02.170
No, I won't let you die, Bonnie Bennett.

41:05.320 --> 41:06.526
You have my word.

41:19.080 --> 41:20.570
DAMON: Bonnie.

41:38.200 --> 41:39.326
I'm sorry.

41:40.240 --> 41:41.605
I don't...

41:45.600 --> 41:46.601
I, um...

41:51.600 --> 41:52.601
I...

42:28.040 --> 42:29.041
