00:16.384 --> 00:23.407
[pounding]

00:23.457 --> 00:52.036
[music]

00:52.086 --> 01:17.528
amantha: Is he awake yet?

01:17.578 --> 01:18.629
janet: Why are you

01:18.679 --> 01:20.131
Whispering?

01:20.181 --> 01:21.065
I don't know.

01:21.115 --> 01:22.533
jared: I think he's in

01:22.583 --> 01:25.436
The bathroom.

01:25.486 --> 01:27.038
okay-- well, the plan is

01:27.088 --> 01:28.406
To stay in atlanta tonight.

01:28.456 --> 01:29.373
Finish packin'.

01:29.423 --> 01:30.241
Be back tomorrow,

01:30.291 --> 01:31.375
As soon as I can.

01:31.425 --> 01:32.243
you don't need more

01:32.293 --> 01:33.244
Time than that?

01:33.294 --> 01:35.813
I'll be fine.

01:35.863 --> 01:37.448
Not much to pack, really.

01:37.498 --> 01:38.482
A phone-- I didn't get him

01:38.532 --> 01:40.484
A phone.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.119
mom did.

01:42.169 --> 01:43.254
you did?

01:43.304 --> 01:44.255
That's wonderful.

01:44.305 --> 01:46.090
When did you

01:46.140 --> 01:46.724
yesterday-- you were right.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.092
We need to be able

01:48.142 --> 01:49.060
To get a hold of him.

01:49.110 --> 01:50.327
I hope he's receptive

01:50.377 --> 01:51.562
To the idea.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.497
He's got 1,500 minutes,

01:53.547 --> 01:54.765
I think.

01:54.815 --> 01:55.733
okay.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.435
Well, we'll see how

01:57.485 --> 01:58.302
He does with that.

01:58.352 --> 01:59.170
Oh, I should get

01:59.220 --> 02:00.271
The number before

02:00.321 --> 02:03.140
patience.

02:03.190 --> 02:04.842
what?

02:04.892 --> 02:05.776
Such a showoff.

02:05.826 --> 02:08.579
why is efficiency considering

02:08.628 --> 02:18.289
well, okay.

02:18.339 --> 02:19.623
I'm just a phone call away.

02:19.673 --> 02:20.591
we'll be fine.

02:20.641 --> 02:21.625
I will.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.761
Can't vouch for mom.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.763
oh, now.

02:25.813 --> 02:29.266
drive safe, okay?

02:29.316 --> 02:40.177
daniel: Good mornin'.

02:40.227 --> 02:42.313
good morning, daniel.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.315
mom.

02:44.365 --> 02:47.351
yes?

02:47.401 --> 02:49.687
I think I need glasses.

02:49.737 --> 02:52.623
oh.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.625
Okay.

02:54.675 --> 02:55.726
I'm sorry, mr. Stern.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.695
Miss person will be with you

02:57.745 --> 03:02.633
miss person: Mr. Stern,

03:02.683 --> 03:03.567
I'm sorry-- I got caught on

03:03.617 --> 03:04.502
A conference call.

03:04.552 --> 03:05.569
You know how those are.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.371
jon: I do-- jon.

03:07.421 --> 03:08.372
sondra, please.

03:08.422 --> 03:09.373
Lenton?

03:09.423 --> 03:10.341
Did you offer mr. Stern

03:10.391 --> 03:11.175
I did.

03:11.225 --> 03:11.909
and my dinner plate is

03:11.959 --> 03:12.910
it's on its way.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.879
okay.

03:14.929 --> 03:21.185
Please.

03:21.235 --> 03:22.653
Sorry it took me so long

03:22.703 --> 03:23.687
To get to you, but I have four

03:23.737 --> 03:24.722
Counties that I have

03:24.772 --> 03:25.823
To attend to.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.158
of course.

03:27.208 --> 03:28.159
not like the city, I imagine.

03:28.209 --> 03:29.894
which city?

03:29.944 --> 03:31.428
take your pick.

03:31.478 --> 03:33.164
Anyhow, how can I help you?

03:33.214 --> 03:36.400
And I encourage

03:36.450 --> 03:37.935
Getting to the point.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.937
you have no case.

03:39.987 --> 03:41.839
I hope that's subjective.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.674
the confession was coerced.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.176
He was in there for 11 hours,

03:45.226 --> 03:46.410
Without a lawyer, and only

03:46.460 --> 03:47.411
The last hour was recorded.

03:47.461 --> 03:48.379
[knocking]

03:48.429 --> 03:49.380
I'm sorry.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.381
The only interruption I okayed

03:50.431 --> 03:51.382
Was for lunch.

03:51.432 --> 03:52.383
Do you mind?

03:52.433 --> 03:53.384
of course not.

03:53.434 --> 03:54.752
lenton.

03:54.802 --> 03:55.753
Please, go on.

03:55.803 --> 03:56.620
well, I think it's clear.

03:56.670 --> 03:57.454
yeast rolls.

03:57.504 --> 03:58.255
butter?

03:58.305 --> 04:00.891
yes, ma'am.

04:00.941 --> 04:03.627
excellent.

04:03.677 --> 04:04.795
The interrogation

04:04.845 --> 04:08.399
Eleven hours, no counsel,

04:08.449 --> 04:09.266
So on, so on.

04:09.316 --> 04:10.434
I'll move to have it

04:10.484 --> 04:11.435
Suppressed.

04:11.485 --> 04:12.403
okay.

04:12.453 --> 04:13.971
and those great witnesses

04:14.021 --> 04:14.939
Back then, the party boys,

04:14.989 --> 04:16.807
If you call them in again

04:16.857 --> 04:18.409
To testify against daniel,

04:18.459 --> 04:19.709
I will skewer them.

04:19.760 --> 04:20.945
okay.

04:20.995 --> 04:22.413
I mean, come on.

04:22.463 --> 04:23.447
Hasn't he suffered enough?

04:23.497 --> 04:24.548
not if he's guilty.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.885
but, he's not guilty, sondra.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.321
Surely, you know that.

04:30.371 --> 04:33.424
jon, please don't tell me

04:33.474 --> 04:34.792
What I know.

04:34.842 --> 04:35.726
I'm reviewing the case,

04:35.776 --> 04:36.727
And it's still exceptionally

04:36.777 --> 04:37.795
Strong, no matter

04:37.845 --> 04:38.829
The dna results.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.998
seriously?

04:41.048 --> 04:42.900
jon, it's inconclusive.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.568
It's confusing.

04:44.618 --> 04:45.569
Now, the results may have been

04:45.619 --> 04:46.937
Sufficient to vacate

04:46.987 --> 04:48.439
The original case, but you

04:48.489 --> 04:49.640
Barely squeaked by with the

04:49.690 --> 04:51.575
Judges up there on that court,

04:51.625 --> 04:52.443
And you know that.

04:52.493 --> 04:53.844
It's not gonna play down here

04:53.894 --> 04:55.946
With regular folk.

04:55.996 --> 04:58.749
But, if you'd like to bring me

04:58.799 --> 05:01.952
Some truly compelling arguments,

05:02.002 --> 05:20.771
[music]

05:20.821 --> 05:22.273
dr: First or second?

05:22.323 --> 05:24.341
first.

05:24.391 --> 05:25.309
first or second?

05:25.359 --> 05:27.478
first.

05:27.528 --> 05:28.646
first or second?

05:28.696 --> 05:30.814
first.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.549
good.

05:32.599 --> 05:36.020
Well, it's mild,

05:36.070 --> 05:36.987
The, uh, nearsightedness.

05:37.037 --> 05:39.056
There is a thing called,

05:39.106 --> 05:40.858
Uh, near work myopia.

05:40.908 --> 05:43.360
The muscles lock in to, uh,

05:43.410 --> 05:45.062
To near focus from prolonged use

05:45.112 --> 05:48.499
At closer distances or from

05:48.549 --> 05:50.968
Lack of use at longer distances.

05:51.018 --> 05:51.902
Same thing, really.

05:51.952 --> 05:52.803
okay.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.405
glasses should clear things

05:54.455 --> 05:55.806
Up in the short-term,

05:55.856 --> 05:57.508
Or your eyes may just do it

05:57.558 --> 05:59.343
All on their own.

05:59.393 --> 06:05.382
how are they?

06:05.432 --> 06:07.918
like I've been lookin' at

06:07.968 --> 06:11.522
Shadows on a cave wall.

06:11.572 --> 06:12.523
as in "plato's cave?"

06:12.573 --> 06:13.524
yes.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.559
I haven't thought

06:15.609 --> 06:22.666
our book report.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.535
well, I was more of

06:24.585 --> 06:25.669
An advisor.

06:25.719 --> 06:30.074
I didn't really understand

06:30.124 --> 06:32.710
The allegory back then.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.012
But, I will say this, mother.

06:35.062 --> 06:38.849
yes?

06:38.899 --> 06:39.850
plato was onto somethin'.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.586
he was considered

06:42.636 --> 06:53.364
kerwin: One... Two... Three,

06:53.414 --> 06:56.600
Four... Five... Six...

06:56.650 --> 07:02.940
Two of hearts.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.475
Man!

07:04.525 --> 07:08.579
ha-ha.

07:08.629 --> 07:09.713
One, two, and three

07:09.763 --> 07:10.914
For good measure.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.649
don't strain anything.

07:12.699 --> 07:18.155
king of diamonds.

07:18.205 --> 07:18.922
oh, bullshit!

07:18.972 --> 07:20.491
don't shoot me.

07:20.541 --> 07:21.158
I'm just the messenger.

07:21.208 --> 07:22.493
how I know you

07:22.543 --> 07:23.494
Ain't lyin' to me?

07:23.544 --> 07:25.629
and how do I know you're

07:25.679 --> 07:27.398
Actually doin' the push-ups?

07:27.448 --> 07:28.399
true.

07:28.449 --> 07:29.900
All right.

07:29.950 --> 07:30.901
ha-ha-ha.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.903
loser of this game

07:32.953 --> 07:33.937
Is really the winner anyway.

07:33.987 --> 07:34.972
Ugh!

07:35.022 --> 07:35.939
Ah!

07:35.989 --> 07:36.840
Ugh!

07:36.890 --> 07:38.742
Ah!

07:38.792 --> 07:40.444
You know, with this new group

07:40.494 --> 07:42.446
Behind ya, you might actually

07:42.496 --> 07:43.480
Get out one day, d.

07:43.530 --> 07:44.815
Ah.

07:44.865 --> 07:47.017
he ain't gettin' out.

07:47.067 --> 07:53.924
Seven diamonds.

07:53.974 --> 08:00.631
I mean, when they call

08:00.681 --> 08:01.765
Themselves non-profit,

08:01.815 --> 08:02.866
That means they got the money

08:02.916 --> 08:05.936
To get your ass out.

08:05.986 --> 08:09.106
You know that's right.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.108
I don't know that's right.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.976
man, sometimes, you act like

08:13.026 --> 08:18.816
queen of hearts.

08:18.866 --> 08:23.554
you're the most reluctant

08:23.604 --> 08:24.655
Innocent man I ever seen.

08:24.705 --> 08:25.823
that's 'cause he

08:25.873 --> 08:27.724
Ain't innocent.

08:27.774 --> 08:29.560
Are you, daniel?

08:29.610 --> 08:30.461
listen, man.

08:30.511 --> 08:31.195
I'm gonna come through

08:31.245 --> 08:32.129
These walls and tear

08:32.179 --> 08:34.965
Your cracker ass up!

08:35.015 --> 08:38.869
You hear me, you sucker bitch?

08:38.919 --> 08:40.971
Damn!

08:41.020 --> 08:54.017
one... Two... Three...

08:54.067 --> 08:58.088
Four... Five... Six...

08:58.138 --> 09:09.933
Just imagine, d-- you could have

09:09.983 --> 09:12.069
A world with windows.

09:12.119 --> 09:13.036
just imagine, voodoo.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.105
You can get your

09:15.155 --> 09:16.607
Own window, too.

09:16.657 --> 09:18.008
You get to look right at that

09:18.058 --> 09:21.712
Little girl's mama,

09:21.762 --> 09:23.180
As she watches you go bye-bye.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.848
Tick-tock.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.518
Tick-tock.

09:27.568 --> 09:32.856
Ace of spades.

09:32.906 --> 09:50.207
meet up later, okay?

09:50.257 --> 09:57.214
relevance.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.916
That's right, simple.

09:58.966 --> 09:59.950
Relevance.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.051
In the age of the internet

10:01.101 --> 10:02.219
And the big box store,

10:02.269 --> 10:03.287
This has become the greatest

10:03.337 --> 10:04.755
Challenge to the independent

10:04.805 --> 10:07.758
Tire dealer.

10:07.808 --> 10:09.893
Our industry is facing a grim

10:09.943 --> 10:11.328
Economic reality.

10:11.378 --> 10:14.598
But, folks, if you are prepared

10:14.648 --> 10:15.899
To think outside the box,

10:15.949 --> 10:17.167
This time next year,

10:17.217 --> 10:19.136
You could be lookin' at your

10:19.186 --> 10:20.771
Highest sales in a decade.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.773
Now, how do we get there?

10:22.823 --> 10:25.776
Two core principles

10:25.826 --> 10:27.177
Specialization and synergy.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.780
Now, the georgia-alabama

10:29.830 --> 10:32.082
Region is made up of 768

10:32.132 --> 10:33.850
Different tire centers.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.085
man: You kiddin' me?

10:35.135 --> 10:36.253
Ethnic minorities,

10:36.303 --> 10:37.254
That's their answer?

10:37.304 --> 10:38.255
I got a store in montgomery.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.690
I know a little somethin'

10:39.740 --> 10:41.091
About ethnic minorities.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.093
With this damn rim, they can

10:43.143 --> 10:44.094
Get 29s, 31s, spinners,

10:44.144 --> 10:45.095
Anything they want delivered

10:45.145 --> 10:46.797
Right to their door

10:46.847 --> 10:48.298
Now, how are we supposed to

10:48.348 --> 10:49.933
Compete with that?

10:49.983 --> 10:53.804
I might as well say it.

10:53.854 --> 10:54.805
I read all about

10:54.855 --> 10:55.939
Your half brother.

10:55.989 --> 10:56.873
step-brother.

10:56.923 --> 10:58.375
saw that press conference,

10:58.425 --> 11:00.277
Too-- man!

11:00.327 --> 11:02.312
Hey, how is he?

11:02.362 --> 11:03.313
He seems like a odd duck.

11:03.363 --> 11:04.348
he was on death row

11:04.398 --> 11:05.349
For 19 years.

11:05.399 --> 11:06.283
You know, been through a lot.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.284
no, I know-- I know.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.285
No, I'm not judging him

11:08.335 --> 11:09.286
Or nothin'.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.121
Just he seemed odd.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.022
You know, the whole thing does.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.857
I got somethin' I wanna discuss

11:13.907 --> 11:14.725
With you in confidence.

11:14.775 --> 11:15.726
It's somethin' might get us out

11:15.776 --> 11:17.794
Of this nickel and dime game

11:17.844 --> 11:33.710
[music]

11:33.760 --> 11:52.329
sonic and sega

11:52.379 --> 12:00.737
you gotta push start.

12:00.787 --> 12:25.729
[music]

12:25.779 --> 13:10.807
[music]

13:10.857 --> 13:27.023
hello.

13:27.073 --> 13:28.859
daniel?

13:28.909 --> 13:30.527
yes.

13:30.577 --> 13:31.962
where are you?

13:32.012 --> 13:33.029
plastics.

13:33.079 --> 13:35.298
what?

13:35.348 --> 13:36.266
boxes, plastic boxes.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.434
well, okay.

13:37.484 --> 13:38.535
Hold on.

13:38.585 --> 13:40.437
I'll come find you.

13:40.487 --> 13:47.444
get your batteries?

13:47.494 --> 13:53.450
Mother.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.385
yes?

13:55.435 --> 13:58.188
I think it's time.

13:58.238 --> 14:02.325
time?

14:02.375 --> 14:04.528
time we got into yarn.

14:04.578 --> 14:06.396
oh, my.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.131
Oh, yes.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.332
wow.

14:09.382 --> 14:10.467
I just hope we're

14:10.517 --> 14:11.468
Not too late.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.003
late?

14:13.053 --> 14:14.037
the yarn bubble.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.906
well, we could always

14:15.956 --> 14:16.873
Fall back on flip flops.

14:16.923 --> 14:18.008
they're seasonal, though,

14:18.058 --> 14:19.242
Flip flops.

14:19.292 --> 14:22.012
true, but isn't yarn?

14:22.062 --> 14:24.047
oh, I'm not sure.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.081
woman: Excuse me.

14:25.131 --> 14:26.216
you know, if you're clothes

14:26.266 --> 14:28.151
Shoppin', kohl's is havin'

14:28.201 --> 14:29.052
A great big sale.

14:29.102 --> 14:33.490
Kohl's cash counts

14:33.540 --> 14:37.561
Double through the weekend.

14:37.611 --> 14:38.595
Well, welcome home, daniel.

14:38.645 --> 14:41.164
I know your mama's thrilled

14:41.214 --> 14:42.365
To have you back.

14:42.415 --> 14:45.368
thank you.

14:45.418 --> 14:56.513
ready to go, mother?

14:56.563 --> 15:13.897
reporter: Daniel holden!

15:13.947 --> 15:14.898
Daniel holden!

15:14.948 --> 15:16.132
How does it feel to be free,

15:16.182 --> 15:17.234
Daniel?

15:17.284 --> 15:20.537
Is there anything you wanna say

15:20.587 --> 15:21.638
To hannah dean's family?

15:21.688 --> 15:22.639
Janet!

15:22.689 --> 15:23.607
no comment.

15:23.657 --> 15:24.941
janet, is it strange

15:24.991 --> 15:25.976
Having your son back?

15:26.026 --> 15:27.077
no comment.

15:27.127 --> 15:28.111
do you have any comment on

15:28.161 --> 15:29.246
Judy dean's statement yesterday

15:29.296 --> 15:31.081
That daniel should've been

15:31.131 --> 15:32.082
Executed for hannah's murder?

15:32.132 --> 15:33.149
Do you have anything you'd

15:33.199 --> 15:36.253
Like to say to mrs. Dean?

15:36.303 --> 15:39.089
no-- no comment.

15:39.139 --> 15:43.960
daniel?

15:44.010 --> 15:46.096
Daniel, does a possibility

15:46.146 --> 15:47.230
Of a retrial scare you?

15:47.280 --> 15:50.066
Daniel, how does it feel

15:50.116 --> 15:54.671
Get the drive away.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.172
Daniel, can you look at

15:56.222 --> 15:57.240
The camera again for us?

15:57.290 --> 15:58.408
maybe I should drive.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.143
daniel, look at the camera!

16:00.193 --> 16:01.978
you don't have your license.

16:02.028 --> 16:05.949
then perhaps we should

16:05.999 --> 16:16.493
daniel, say something!

16:16.543 --> 16:56.633
[knocking]

16:56.683 --> 17:05.241
carl: Hey, there, darlin'.

17:05.290 --> 17:10.180
trey: How's it goin',

17:10.230 --> 17:12.415
Sheriff?

17:12.464 --> 17:14.351
it's goin'.

17:14.401 --> 17:18.054
girl: Daddy, watch!

17:18.104 --> 17:19.189
uh-huh.

17:19.239 --> 17:20.390
looks like hannah dean wasn't

17:20.440 --> 17:22.392
Quite the portrait of purity

17:22.442 --> 17:23.326
Everybody thought she was.

17:23.376 --> 17:24.728
well, that's the portrait

17:24.778 --> 17:25.729
That roland painted.

17:25.779 --> 17:27.230
what are you sayin'?

17:27.280 --> 17:29.666
what are you sayin'?

17:29.716 --> 17:30.500
Come on, sheriff.

17:30.550 --> 17:31.735
There's at least half a dozen

17:31.785 --> 17:34.404
Boys she slept with before she

17:34.454 --> 17:37.273
Was 15 years old, and at least

17:37.323 --> 17:38.274
One adult from what I heard.

17:38.324 --> 17:39.275
that's a god awful

17:39.325 --> 17:42.045
Mouthful, trey.

17:42.095 --> 17:44.781
but not the best kept secret,

17:44.831 --> 17:46.516
Back then anyway.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.051
look, I just wanna make sure

17:48.101 --> 17:48.718
You wasn't one of 'em.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.420
I ain't gonna lie.

17:50.470 --> 17:51.454
I slept with her,

17:51.504 --> 17:54.090
But not on that night,

17:54.140 --> 18:01.264
Man!

18:01.314 --> 18:02.132
Man!

18:02.182 --> 18:04.234
How long we known

18:04.284 --> 18:05.268
Each other, carl?

18:05.318 --> 18:07.237
Huh?

18:07.287 --> 18:08.705
Your youngest, my oldest

18:08.755 --> 18:10.240
Playin' ball together.

18:10.290 --> 18:14.244
Patty and meredith doin' that

18:14.294 --> 18:18.415
Cancer drive every year.

18:18.465 --> 18:21.051
Me and you

18:21.101 --> 18:22.652
All right, then-- all right.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.587
I got you.

18:24.637 --> 18:26.389
Is that how it is?

18:26.439 --> 18:28.658
Hmm?

18:28.708 --> 18:29.659
Here, take that.

18:29.709 --> 18:30.560
Ain't that how they do it?

18:30.610 --> 18:31.561
You take that.

18:31.611 --> 18:32.562
Take it to the lab.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.563
Do whatever the hell

18:33.613 --> 18:34.564
Ya'll do with it.

18:34.614 --> 18:35.598
now, hold on a minute.

18:35.648 --> 18:36.633
now, hold on nothin'.

18:36.683 --> 18:37.801
I don't like you comin' to my

18:37.851 --> 18:39.102
House insinuatin' things, carl!

18:39.152 --> 18:40.136
daddy?

18:40.186 --> 18:41.104
it's okay, baby.

18:41.154 --> 18:42.138
look, nobody's insinuatin'

18:42.188 --> 18:43.306
Anything, trey.

18:43.356 --> 18:44.307
Just calm down.

18:44.357 --> 18:45.408
bullshit!

18:45.458 --> 18:46.409
I don't know what you

18:46.459 --> 18:47.410
Want from me, carl.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.578
I saw holden and her

18:48.628 --> 18:49.479
Arrive together.

18:49.529 --> 18:50.313
I saw them arguin'

18:50.363 --> 18:51.181
With each other.

18:51.231 --> 18:52.582
I saw 'em wanderin' off

18:52.632 --> 18:53.583
Together.

18:53.633 --> 18:54.751
Now, that's what I testified to

18:54.801 --> 18:58.321
Then, and that's what

18:58.371 --> 19:00.690
I remember now.

19:00.740 --> 19:01.758
I hear you, trey.

19:01.808 --> 19:02.759
I just don't want

19:02.809 --> 19:04.194
Anymore big surprises.

19:04.244 --> 19:06.096
well, you ain't gonna

19:06.146 --> 19:15.672
look, I didn't mean to

19:15.722 --> 19:17.607
no.

19:17.657 --> 19:20.610
I understand.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.812
You got a job to do.

19:22.862 --> 19:25.448
I just get a little sensitive

19:25.498 --> 19:26.616
Around the kids and

19:26.666 --> 19:27.650
I hear you.

19:27.700 --> 19:28.685
look, I wish I had seen him

19:28.735 --> 19:30.320
Do it, carl, because I know

19:30.370 --> 19:32.455
He did.

19:32.505 --> 19:37.694
nobody's askin' you

19:37.744 --> 19:47.203
What about george melton?

19:47.253 --> 19:48.238
what about him?

19:48.288 --> 19:49.472
you ain't happen to hear

19:49.522 --> 19:50.406
From him lately, have you?

19:50.456 --> 19:54.410
no, I ain't talked

19:54.460 --> 19:56.546
To georgie in a good while.

19:56.596 --> 19:59.549
I'm trying to track him down.

19:59.599 --> 20:00.850
You got any contact info on him?

20:00.900 --> 20:05.755
got a cell phone number in

20:05.805 --> 20:06.823
The house, if it's still good.

20:06.873 --> 20:09.359
Yeah, last I heard from

20:09.409 --> 20:13.329
Georgie boy, he was down in

20:13.379 --> 20:22.438
daddy!

20:22.488 --> 20:25.441
Daddy, watch me!

20:25.491 --> 20:27.744
mm-hmm-- I see you.

20:27.794 --> 20:28.878
Here we go.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.180
Whoo!

20:30.230 --> 20:31.381
Keep goin'!

20:31.431 --> 20:34.717
There, you got it!

20:34.767 --> 20:37.387
Aw.

20:37.437 --> 20:39.222
so, you want your card back?

20:39.272 --> 20:40.390
no.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.225
No, keep it, in case the county

20:42.275 --> 20:44.394
Commission approves a new jail.

20:44.444 --> 20:45.395
pssh-- that'll be the day.

20:45.445 --> 20:46.696
well, if they ever do,

20:46.746 --> 20:49.265
Make sure I get a bid on it.

20:49.315 --> 20:52.602
top of the list, trey.

20:52.652 --> 20:53.603
daddy, watch me!

20:53.653 --> 20:54.904
it's a shame she ain't

20:54.954 --> 20:56.539
Cute at all.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.208
she gets it from her daddy.

20:58.258 --> 20:59.542
yeah.

20:59.592 --> 21:02.212
I'll catch you later, trey.

21:02.262 --> 21:19.562

21:22.548 --> 21:23.733

21:23.783 --> 21:28.638
Possibly can.

21:28.688 --> 21:31.674
Number is 678-408-0467.

21:31.724 --> 21:48.591
[music]

21:48.641 --> 21:54.364
you'll be long?

21:54.414 --> 21:55.598
I can wait.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.867
I don't know.

21:57.917 --> 22:00.003
I think I might walk back.

22:00.053 --> 22:02.438
it's a long hike.

22:02.488 --> 22:11.948
I had a nice day, mother.

22:11.998 --> 22:18.655
Oh, daniel.

22:18.705 --> 22:54.657
tawney: Thank you.

22:54.707 --> 22:57.527
woman: Tawney?

22:57.577 --> 23:05.101
so glad you got the card.

23:05.151 --> 23:07.770
Come on-- I'll show you around.

23:07.820 --> 23:08.905
You didn't have to dress up.

23:08.955 --> 23:10.740
no, I-I-I went

23:10.790 --> 23:13.876
To get glasses.

23:13.926 --> 23:15.578
oh-- you're sweet.

23:15.628 --> 23:17.413
We're gettin' ready

23:17.463 --> 23:19.115
For the annual jubilee.

23:19.165 --> 23:21.918
There are games for kids

23:21.968 --> 23:24.120
And fellowship, baptisms.

23:24.170 --> 23:25.421
It's like a revival.

23:25.471 --> 23:27.724
I-I don't want you to think

23:27.774 --> 23:32.562
I just thought you might like

23:32.612 --> 23:33.730
To be around people.

23:33.780 --> 23:35.398
Well, I'm not against it

23:35.448 --> 23:37.734
In theory.

23:37.784 --> 23:44.607
Pastor beau?

23:44.657 --> 23:45.608
pastor beau: Tawney.

23:45.658 --> 23:49.579
there's someone special

23:49.629 --> 23:52.081
I'd like to introduce you to.

23:52.131 --> 23:53.383
well, welcome.

23:53.433 --> 23:54.584
this is daniel.

23:54.634 --> 23:55.418

23:55.468 --> 23:57.053
Yeah, hello.

24:00.473 --> 24:02.392
The world of tawney here.

Put up with teddy, you know?

24:09.816 --> 24:10.833
I understand.

24:10.883 --> 24:12.735
pastor beau, I thought it

24:12.785 --> 24:14.070
Might be nice for daniel to,

24:14.120 --> 24:15.605
You know, meet some people,

24:15.655 --> 24:16.906
Fellowship and all.

24:16.956 --> 24:17.974
that's very considerate

24:18.024 --> 24:19.509
Of you, tawney.

24:19.559 --> 24:21.110
I-I saw some of your-your

24:21.160 --> 24:22.678
Slides on, uh, the chapel wall.

24:22.728 --> 24:23.746
oh.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.481
Well, young people do like

24:25.531 --> 24:26.749
The multimedia these days.

24:26.799 --> 24:29.919
yeah, raphael's painting,

24:29.969 --> 24:31.087
The moment he became god's son.

24:31.137 --> 24:33.623
I like to think

24:33.673 --> 24:35.158
He already was, but yeah.

24:35.208 --> 24:37.126
I-I used to wish I-I'd

24:37.176 --> 24:39.462
Seen miracles like that.

24:39.512 --> 24:40.763
But, better to hear

24:40.813 --> 24:42.031
The tale third-hand.

24:42.081 --> 24:44.100
It might've been too

24:44.150 --> 24:47.136
Overwhelming,

24:47.186 --> 24:49.005
Scary to believe.

24:49.055 --> 24:50.206
well, many were afraid,

24:50.256 --> 24:52.842
Certainly.

24:52.892 --> 24:56.846
I'll bet.

24:56.896 --> 24:58.114
anyway, ha-ha.

24:58.164 --> 24:59.515
Picture tells 1,000 words,

24:59.565 --> 25:00.650
Doesn't it?

25:00.700 --> 25:02.151
sorry to bother you, pastor.

25:02.201 --> 25:04.687
no, no bother at all.

25:04.737 --> 25:08.124
It's nice to meet you, daniel.

25:08.174 --> 25:09.826
yes.

25:09.876 --> 25:16.799
I hope you don't think I brought

25:16.849 --> 25:18.167
You here to put ya to work.

25:18.217 --> 25:21.003
chop wood and carry water

25:21.053 --> 25:23.673
It's soothin'.

25:23.723 --> 25:25.508
that's nice.

25:25.558 --> 25:29.212
you're very accomplished.

25:29.262 --> 25:30.513
with casseroles, big deal.

25:30.563 --> 25:33.483
well, big to those

25:33.533 --> 25:38.187
is there a church in prison?

25:38.237 --> 25:39.822
there was, but I was

25:39.872 --> 25:41.724
Only ever allowed visits

25:41.774 --> 25:43.192
By the chaplain.

25:43.242 --> 25:44.527
oh, you'd meet with him?

25:44.577 --> 25:48.164
I-I would've met with the

25:48.214 --> 25:49.098
Executioner, and he stopped by.

25:49.148 --> 25:50.099
what sort of things

25:50.149 --> 25:53.002
Would you talk about?

25:53.052 --> 25:54.504
I mean, with the chaplain?

25:54.554 --> 25:55.705
well, flannery o'connor,

25:55.755 --> 25:58.508
For one,

25:58.558 --> 25:59.242
He was a big fan.

25:59.292 --> 26:00.710
did you ever talk about

26:00.760 --> 26:01.944
Where you think you'll go

26:01.994 --> 26:03.079
When you die?

26:03.129 --> 26:05.915
it was kind of expected

26:05.965 --> 26:06.916
In the setting.

26:06.966 --> 26:08.718
did he come to any

26:08.768 --> 26:09.619
Conclusions?

26:09.669 --> 26:11.220
that it wasn't worth

26:11.270 --> 26:13.189
Pondering.

26:13.239 --> 26:15.925
but, of course it is.

26:15.975 --> 26:17.727
It's what makes us human.

26:17.777 --> 26:19.028
I-I think what makes us human

26:19.078 --> 26:21.931
Is the ability to choose

26:21.981 --> 26:23.866
To ponder or not to ponder.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.034
free will.

26:25.084 --> 26:28.104
yeah, I-I focused on

26:28.154 --> 26:30.306
Preparing for the act itself

26:30.356 --> 26:32.742
Rather than the result

26:32.792 --> 26:34.810
Of the act.

26:34.860 --> 26:36.746
the act?

26:36.796 --> 26:39.549
of dyin', of-of-of

26:39.599 --> 26:42.652
Lettin' go.

26:42.702 --> 26:46.122
why can't you do both?

26:46.172 --> 26:47.056
some do.

26:47.106 --> 26:49.125
but, why can't you,

26:49.175 --> 26:51.093
If it is a choice?

26:51.143 --> 26:53.329
finding peace in-in

26:53.379 --> 26:54.764
Not knowin' seems strangely more

26:54.814 --> 26:58.134
Righteous than the peace

26:58.184 --> 27:05.675
even if that knowin'

27:05.725 --> 27:08.077
Might be true?

27:08.127 --> 27:13.749
you-you make a better case

27:13.799 --> 27:21.324
I don't pretend to know

27:21.374 --> 27:27.797
Everything, daniel,

27:27.847 --> 27:29.165
But I care about you,

27:29.215 --> 27:31.367
And I would just hate it,

27:31.417 --> 27:34.971
If you went to hell.

27:35.021 --> 27:38.007
I mean, if there is

27:38.057 --> 27:39.609
I don't know.

27:39.659 --> 27:42.278
you're my beatrice.

27:42.328 --> 27:46.115
what?

27:46.165 --> 27:49.619
from "the divine comedy."

27:49.669 --> 27:51.721
I-I don't know what that is.

27:51.771 --> 27:55.224
she was dante's guide,

27:55.274 --> 27:56.325
His salvation.

27:56.375 --> 27:58.794
well, I-I don't know

27:58.844 --> 28:09.372
it was fiction.

28:09.422 --> 28:14.076
he's in sheet metal roofin'.

28:14.126 --> 28:15.645
The price of steel,

28:15.695 --> 28:17.647
China, regulations all eatin'

28:17.697 --> 28:19.348
His ass up, just like all of us.

28:19.398 --> 28:20.916
But then, last year, boom,

28:20.966 --> 28:21.851
Tornado-tornado-tornado,

28:21.901 --> 28:23.753
All within a half hour

28:23.803 --> 28:24.387
Of his business.

28:24.437 --> 28:25.988
He gets in on this deal.

28:26.038 --> 28:27.056
You know how much he makes?

28:27.106 --> 28:28.057
fifty k?

28:28.107 --> 28:30.660
a hundred and eleven

28:30.710 --> 28:35.731
and he's just

28:35.781 --> 28:37.867
A subcontractor.

28:37.917 --> 28:40.169
jesus, just tornados?

28:40.219 --> 28:41.871
mm-hmm-- exactly.

28:41.921 --> 28:43.706
Gives subcontractors a cut.

28:43.756 --> 28:44.740
Mexicans do all the work.

28:44.790 --> 28:45.875
God willing,

28:45.925 --> 28:46.942
The creek does rise,

28:46.992 --> 28:48.878
We could be clearin' six figures

28:48.928 --> 28:49.912
By the end of next year.

28:49.962 --> 28:52.014
government money?

28:52.064 --> 28:52.948
and that, ted, don't quit.

28:52.998 --> 28:53.883
that's exactly the damn

28:53.933 --> 28:55.017
Problem, though.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.352
It's government.

28:56.402 --> 28:57.953
piss on the boot, ted.

28:58.003 --> 28:59.088
You-you gonna get mad at me

28:59.138 --> 29:00.389
For tryin' to help you put

29:00.439 --> 29:02.358
Food on your table?

29:02.408 --> 29:03.359
It's all gone to shit.

29:03.409 --> 29:07.129
Honest pay for an honest

29:07.179 --> 29:09.432
Day's work-- that's dead, son.

29:09.482 --> 29:10.399
The game's rigged.

29:10.449 --> 29:11.901
Somebody's gonna get on this

29:11.951 --> 29:14.937
Gravy train.

29:14.987 --> 29:32.221
it's beautiful here,

29:32.271 --> 29:35.391
Comforting.

29:35.441 --> 29:37.793
I'm real glad you came.

29:37.843 --> 29:40.463
I hope you didn't feel pressure.

29:40.513 --> 29:48.838
Why are you so concerned

29:48.888 --> 29:49.772
About my long-term future?

29:49.822 --> 29:51.173
I'm concerned about

29:51.223 --> 29:54.310
Everyone's, but that's just

29:54.360 --> 29:55.244
Part of it, you know?

29:55.294 --> 29:57.947
I don't want you to think

29:57.997 --> 29:59.749
That's all my belief is.

29:59.799 --> 30:02.485
It's the here and the now that

30:02.535 --> 30:05.254
My faith in god sustains me.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.022
sustains or numbs you?

30:07.072 --> 30:08.524
oh, no.

30:08.574 --> 30:11.160
I see and feel things more

30:11.210 --> 30:16.966
Sharply now than before I found

30:17.016 --> 30:19.168
God, more rightly, more fully,

30:19.218 --> 30:21.203
But it doesn't overwhelm me.

30:21.253 --> 30:27.143
It fills me up with

30:27.193 --> 30:37.219
I never told anyone this,

30:37.269 --> 30:41.791
Not-not even teddy, but I can

30:41.841 --> 30:44.794
See and feel god in all things.

30:44.844 --> 30:47.997
like thomas aquinas.

30:48.047 --> 30:50.132
I don't know much about him.

30:50.182 --> 30:52.368
he felt that god revealed

30:52.418 --> 30:55.471
Himself in nature.

30:55.521 --> 30:58.307
yes, yes, I

30:58.357 --> 31:00.810
That's what I feel or sense.

31:00.860 --> 31:02.011
he believed that supernatural

31:02.061 --> 31:03.012
Revelation was faith

31:03.062 --> 31:04.814
And natural revelation

31:04.864 --> 31:09.018
Was reason, and the two

31:09.068 --> 31:14.557
Were not contradictory,

31:14.607 --> 31:16.025
But complimentary.

31:16.075 --> 31:19.195
you're different from how

31:19.245 --> 31:21.030
I thought you'd be.

31:21.080 --> 31:23.899
different how?

31:23.949 --> 31:25.067
I don't know.

31:25.117 --> 31:28.337
You're above things,

31:28.387 --> 31:32.041
Like you're pure.

31:32.091 --> 31:51.060
could you ever accept christ

31:51.110 --> 31:53.229
Into your heart?

31:53.279 --> 31:56.131
I don't think buddha would

31:56.181 --> 31:58.367
Mind making room, or confucius.

31:58.417 --> 32:06.442
you're so smart.

32:06.492 --> 32:08.077
not really.

32:08.127 --> 32:11.046
I've just spent long hours

32:11.096 --> 32:18.287
could you ever see yourself

32:18.337 --> 32:21.090
Being baptized?

32:21.140 --> 32:22.558
it's a beautiful ceremony.

32:22.608 --> 32:26.996
it isn't just a ceremony.

32:27.046 --> 32:29.098
It's you're given new life.

32:29.148 --> 32:31.166
hard to fathom.

32:31.216 --> 32:34.003
just the feeling of it,

32:34.053 --> 32:35.337
Being submerged,

32:35.387 --> 32:37.172
And the water cleansing you

32:37.222 --> 32:41.110
Of every sin, and when you

32:41.160 --> 32:42.244
Emerge, you're different.

32:42.294 --> 32:44.580
It's like they say.

32:44.630 --> 32:59.295
I don't know.

32:59.345 --> 33:09.338
Maybe.

33:09.388 --> 33:20.015
I... Could be.

33:20.065 --> 33:21.450
Sure.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.686
I-I could be.

33:23.736 --> 33:41.303
[music]

33:41.353 --> 33:48.310
I-I'm sorry.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.378
I'm not trying to do anything.

33:49.428 --> 33:52.014
no, it's okay.

33:52.064 --> 33:53.182
Everybody needs to be held.

33:53.232 --> 33:54.984
it does somethin' to ya

33:55.034 --> 33:57.653
Not to be touched in any

33:57.703 --> 33:59.088
Positive way for so long.

33:59.138 --> 34:00.322
You begin to vacillate between

34:00.372 --> 34:02.391
Bein' repelled by touch

34:02.441 --> 34:07.496
And seeking it out in any form,

34:07.546 --> 34:10.666
Even the most negative.

34:10.716 --> 34:14.203
I'm so sorry.

34:14.253 --> 34:15.504
out here, you

34:15.554 --> 34:19.507
You-you're the only touch

34:19.558 --> 34:23.112
That soothed me.

34:23.161 --> 34:25.614
I know that's not proper.

34:25.664 --> 34:29.018
well, hugging every once

34:29.068 --> 34:32.420
In a while is okay, I think.

34:32.471 --> 34:35.290
Maybe just keep tryin'

34:35.340 --> 34:37.626
With others.

34:37.676 --> 34:38.761
okay, I will.

34:38.811 --> 34:39.728
hey, and I can still

34:39.777 --> 34:43.232
Give you a ride home.

34:43.282 --> 34:46.702
There's nothin' wrong with that.

34:46.752 --> 34:54.710
okay.

34:54.760 --> 34:58.380
I'll see ya tomorrow.

35:57.356 --> 36:01.143
My great aunt verna drove

36:01.193 --> 36:02.211
60 miles from cordia to macon,

36:02.261 --> 36:04.780
To save 20 bucks on a set

36:04.830 --> 36:06.782
Of radials.

36:06.832 --> 36:09.318
She called me for help?

36:09.368 --> 36:12.321
Hell no.

36:12.371 --> 36:16.658
And that's the damn problem

Those days are over.

Don't matter what we do now

Anyway, now that daniel's here.

You're right, kent!

You're right.

36:44.469 --> 36:51.160
You're makin' out with a girl.

Very nice meeting you.
