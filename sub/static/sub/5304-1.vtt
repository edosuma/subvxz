03:07.062 --> 03:11.566
I got out of the institution
on the day of my sister's wedding.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.569
I had started to get used to the place.

03:14.653 --> 03:17.071
Breakfast at 8:00, classes at 2:00,

03:17.281 --> 03:20.533
therapy at 4:00 and asleep by 10:00.

03:20.951 --> 03:23.160
You can call me any time, Lee.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.205
I will always try to be of help to you.

03:26.290 --> 03:28.541
Inside, life was simple.

03:29.585 --> 03:31.002
Thank you, Dr. Twardon.

03:31.086 --> 03:34.046
For that reason, I was reluctant to go.

03:34.256 --> 03:35.923
Bon voyage.

04:23.305 --> 04:24.639
Hi, Peter.

04:24.723 --> 04:28.726
Peter, yeah,
who you almost successfully forgot.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.645
- No, I did not.
- Come on, everybody!

04:31.146 --> 04:32.897
Are you happy to be home?

04:34.983 --> 04:37.360
I mean, are you happy to be home?

04:39.196 --> 04:40.655
I don't know.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.116
I know what you mean.

04:58.757 --> 05:02.009
Here's a little something
for the lovebirds.

05:03.387 --> 05:04.637
Boy!

05:06.056 --> 05:08.140
You look so beautiful.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.685
Thanks, Dad.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.022
I thought you stopped.

05:19.069 --> 05:21.362
Do you know how much
we missed you, pumpkin?

05:21.905 --> 05:23.823
Well, I missed you, too.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.831
You know what?

05:32.082 --> 05:34.041
I don't feel too good.

05:34.543 --> 05:36.377
Let's go sit down.

06:58.502 --> 07:00.252
- Bye!
- Goodbye!

07:03.090 --> 07:06.342
- Have fun!
- Goodbye! Take care!

07:26.321 --> 07:27.321
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

07:27.405 --> 07:30.324
<i>You want to treat me like I'm a child.
You want to talk to me like a child.</i>

07:30.408 --> 07:31.408
<i>- Huh? You think I'm a child?
- You...</i>

07:31.493 --> 07:32.827
<i>You think I don't know
what I'm doing?</i>

07:32.911 --> 07:34.245
<i>You act like a child!</i>

07:34.329 --> 07:35.329
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

07:35.413 --> 07:38.165
<i>You don't act like a man.
You've been fired!</i>

07:39.668 --> 07:41.585
<i>Well, I'm glad I'm fired!</i>

07:41.670 --> 07:44.088
I'm glad I'm fired!
Boy, I hated that job!

07:44.172 --> 07:46.757
I don't care that you hated it!
You're drunk!

07:46.842 --> 07:49.593
I'm not drunk! Why do you...
Why do you... I'm not drunk!

07:49.678 --> 07:52.680
- Why do you always say that?
- Get off my back!

08:07.028 --> 08:10.197
Watch this. You watch this.

09:14.971 --> 09:17.181
Avoid the temptation
of placing your fingers

09:17.265 --> 09:19.266
on the home keys by sight.

09:19.893 --> 09:24.230
Strike each key so that your fingers
bounce with each stroke.

09:24.439 --> 09:26.607
Do not strike without thinking.

09:26.691 --> 09:30.861
Do not even attempt
to steal a glance at your paper.

09:31.279 --> 09:34.198
"My flowers had just
about given up in despair,

09:34.282 --> 09:37.451
"so with the exception
of a few potted plants from the florist,

09:37.535 --> 09:40.621
"we're flowerless
for the first spring in years."

09:40.789 --> 09:42.289
And time!

09:45.335 --> 09:47.419
I'm so proud of you, honey.

09:47.879 --> 09:50.297
Getting out in the world like this.

09:52.968 --> 09:55.052
When my accident happened,

09:56.471 --> 09:59.765
we were in the kitchen
and my back was to her.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.727
Upstairs, my dad was just leaving for work

10:03.812 --> 10:05.980
at Havis department store.

10:06.564 --> 10:10.317
Because there was a limited amount of time
that my mom's back was turned...

10:10.902 --> 10:13.404
- Lee!
- I slipped and cut too deep.

10:14.656 --> 10:17.324
I'm not sure how I could have misjudged.

10:17.742 --> 10:20.160
I've been doing it since seventh grade.

10:37.679 --> 10:39.346
Just a precaution.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.354
"Be a leader."

11:38.156 --> 11:40.366
I have never had a job before,

11:42.243 --> 11:46.497
but I can assure you that I am very excited
about this opportunity.

11:47.624 --> 11:48.957
Thank you.

11:50.502 --> 11:54.338
Well, I don't have any references yet.

11:55.048 --> 11:58.050
But I think that the municipal tax office

11:58.134 --> 12:02.888
would be a wonderful place to begin

12:04.724 --> 12:06.266
my career.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.362
"Secretary."

13:34.105 --> 13:35.647
Hello. I...

13:37.984 --> 13:39.318
Wait! I...

13:57.212 --> 13:59.222
Hello?

14:08.264 --> 14:09.473
In here.

14:18.233 --> 14:24.196
Hi.

14:26.908 --> 14:28.325
Are you the lawyer?

14:29.661 --> 14:30.811
Oh. Uh...

14:33.164 --> 14:34.314
Yes.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.334
I'm sorry. I'll just come back later.

14:37.418 --> 14:38.568
No.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.588
No, stay.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.276
It said "secretary."

15:05.280 --> 15:06.697
That's right.

15:11.786 --> 15:13.370
Are you pregnant?

15:16.249 --> 15:17.399
No.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.295
Do you plan on getting pregnant?

15:25.341 --> 15:26.491
No.

15:27.969 --> 15:30.887
- Are you living in an apartment?
- A house.

15:30.972 --> 15:33.640
- Alone?
- With my parents.

15:34.142 --> 15:35.434
Siblings?

15:36.644 --> 15:39.229
Well, my sister is going to live
in the backyard

15:39.314 --> 15:41.732
with her husband in the pool house.

15:42.859 --> 15:44.009
Are you married?

15:45.403 --> 15:46.553
No.

15:49.324 --> 15:51.491
Have you ever won an award?

15:51.784 --> 15:52.784
Yes.

15:52.869 --> 15:54.745
What did you win the award in?

15:54.829 --> 15:55.996
Typing.

16:02.503 --> 16:03.837
Are those your scores?

16:07.675 --> 16:08.825
Yes.

16:09.844 --> 16:12.387
"Lee Holloway."

16:23.858 --> 16:26.068
Could you get me
a cup of coffee with sugar?

17:27.755 --> 17:30.048
Do you really want to be a secretary, Lee?

17:30.466 --> 17:31.800
Yes, I do.

17:39.684 --> 17:42.978
You scored higher
than anyone I've ever interviewed.

17:44.272 --> 17:47.774
You're really over-qualified for the job.

17:48.443 --> 17:51.653
- You'd be bored to death.
- I want to be bored.

17:59.954 --> 18:02.497
I have a part-time paralegal.

18:03.416 --> 18:08.378
All I need is a typist

18:09.130 --> 18:13.467
who can get to work on time
and answer the phone.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.260
I can do that.

18:15.636 --> 18:19.306
We only use typewriters here,
not computers.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.082
That's fine.

18:21.225 --> 18:24.186
It's very dull work.

18:25.146 --> 18:26.730
I like dull work.

18:33.821 --> 18:36.114
There's something about you.

18:39.035 --> 18:40.185
You're...

18:43.247 --> 18:46.291
You're closed up tight.

18:48.586 --> 18:49.795
A wall.

18:51.672 --> 18:52.881
I know.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.676
Do you ever loosen up?

19:00.681 --> 19:02.140
I don't know.

19:06.395 --> 19:07.604
I'm not here.

19:22.537 --> 19:24.621
Less sugar in the coffee.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.756
How'd it go?

19:37.760 --> 19:39.052
I got it.

19:47.854 --> 19:50.355
I knew you could do it!

20:05.663 --> 20:06.813
Hello.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.370
Hello.

20:23.347 --> 20:28.643
You have reached the office
of Mr. E. Edward Grey.

20:30.354 --> 20:33.607
Please leave your message
and the time you called,

20:33.983 --> 20:36.735
along with your phone number

20:37.069 --> 20:39.404
and the best time to reach you,

20:42.783 --> 20:49.539
and we will get back to you
as soon as possible.

20:52.460 --> 20:53.610
We.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.422
Secretary.

21:09.435 --> 21:13.313
Type up this letter and send four
copies to O'Malley and Barrett.

21:14.649 --> 21:16.274
Right away, sir.

21:29.330 --> 21:31.665
That's good. That's good.

21:36.337 --> 21:38.380
So, you're the new secretary.

21:40.758 --> 21:41.908
Yeah.

21:46.931 --> 21:48.223
Excuse me.

21:48.349 --> 21:50.600
What exactly is a paralegal?

21:59.026 --> 22:00.276
See you.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.367
Oh, um...

22:23.551 --> 22:25.593
Okay.

22:27.138 --> 22:31.516
Up at the sides. Wide-eyed.

22:56.417 --> 22:58.209
I brought you these.

23:05.760 --> 23:10.680
I think I accidentally threw out my notes
on the Feldman case.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.098
Maybe you could...

23:12.183 --> 23:14.267
Go through the garbage?

23:20.775 --> 23:22.150
Yes, Lee. Thank you.

24:37.101 --> 24:38.351
Why are you here?

24:39.854 --> 24:41.938
I'm just waiting for you, honey.

24:42.106 --> 24:44.357
But I'm here for five more hours.

24:45.484 --> 24:46.693
I know.

24:59.248 --> 25:01.040
Excuse me, sir.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.378
It's okay. I found another set.

25:09.175 --> 25:10.550
This needs more sugar.

25:10.926 --> 25:13.052
- Sugar?
- And six copies of these.

25:16.348 --> 25:17.640
Freshen up that trap, Lee.

25:17.725 --> 25:19.517
And put out one more.

25:47.046 --> 25:50.089
Mice like to go behind the chairs, too, Lee.

25:50.633 --> 25:52.342
Just because it's hard to reach

25:52.426 --> 25:55.261
does not mean that we don't
take care of every possibility.

26:01.602 --> 26:03.436
Here. Give me that.

26:19.370 --> 26:20.620
Thank you.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.790
E. Edward Grey's office. May I help you?

27:07.293 --> 27:10.003
We're very happy with AT&T.
Thanks, though.

27:10.379 --> 27:11.421
Is he in?

27:11.505 --> 27:12.672
Could you just wait one moment?

27:15.426 --> 27:17.302
You're right.
That is a very good offer.

27:17.386 --> 27:18.594
I'm going back now.

27:18.679 --> 27:21.306
Could you just wait one minute, please?

27:23.183 --> 27:24.892
Yes, I do understand that.

27:25.769 --> 27:26.936
Submissive.

27:29.732 --> 27:30.882
Excuse me?

27:30.983 --> 27:32.133
Edward!

27:33.819 --> 27:38.281
Listen, I have no idea if we make over $40

27:38.365 --> 27:41.409
worth of long distance calls
to Chattanooga each month.

27:45.748 --> 27:47.957
Tell him it's Tricia O'Connor.

27:49.585 --> 27:51.085
Mr. Grey?

27:58.719 --> 27:59.886
Hello?

28:05.726 --> 28:06.976
Mr. Grey?

28:07.561 --> 28:09.187
Ms. Holloway.

28:19.073 --> 28:20.365
Mr. Grey?

28:22.409 --> 28:23.910
I'm not here.

28:28.332 --> 28:29.499
Okay.

28:36.382 --> 28:37.799
I'm afraid he's gone.

28:38.884 --> 28:40.218
Is that right?

28:46.934 --> 28:48.935
E. Edward Grey's office.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.354
Is that you, honey? It's me.

28:51.438 --> 28:52.588
Daddy?

28:53.023 --> 28:54.732
It's so good to hear your voice.

28:54.817 --> 28:56.109
Dad.

28:56.902 --> 28:58.052
Where are you?

28:58.737 --> 29:01.072
I'm downtown, somewhere.

29:02.408 --> 29:04.450
Could you please hold?

29:07.037 --> 29:09.038
Do you have a message, Ms. O'Connor?

29:20.384 --> 29:22.677
Tell him to sign the settlement.

29:28.475 --> 29:29.642
Hello?

29:30.894 --> 29:32.061
Hello?

29:33.105 --> 29:34.480
Hello, Dad?

30:53.560 --> 30:55.228
How's work?

30:55.729 --> 30:56.879
Fine.

30:58.357 --> 30:59.649
How's Mr. Grey?

31:01.360 --> 31:02.485
He's fine.

31:02.569 --> 31:04.695
Well, Peter called.

31:14.039 --> 31:17.667
Some people, right, have to wash
something as soon as they've worn it,

31:17.751 --> 31:19.585
- you know, for, like, half a day.
- Yes.

31:19.670 --> 31:21.629
And then you got your more
laid-back folk who just,

31:21.713 --> 31:24.006
you know, maybe they'll
wash their stuff when it's dirty.

31:24.091 --> 31:25.800
Which kind are you?

31:26.969 --> 31:28.719
I'm the type of guy

31:30.180 --> 31:32.807
who wants to get married and have a kid.

31:36.395 --> 31:39.188
I wash my clothes just when they're dirty.

31:39.606 --> 31:43.442
Me, too, and...
And that is what counts in a relationship.

31:44.278 --> 31:45.778
Compatibility.

31:47.990 --> 31:49.574
In a relationship?

31:49.658 --> 31:50.955
- Ln a relationship.
- Relationship.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.673
May I interest you in a little more?

32:06.091 --> 32:08.843
- Just a little more?
- Why not? Okay.

32:15.225 --> 32:18.060
You're different
than you were in high school, Peter.

32:18.228 --> 32:20.521
I... I changed.

32:20.981 --> 32:22.189
What happened?

32:22.733 --> 32:24.734
I had a nervous breakdown.

32:25.819 --> 32:27.069
Me, too.

32:29.489 --> 32:30.698
Sort of.

32:35.621 --> 32:39.081
Two items. This and these.

32:39.166 --> 32:41.042
- Peter?
- Yes, Lee?

32:41.126 --> 32:45.379
I've read that if you
wear that kind of underwear,

32:46.006 --> 32:48.841
that it squeezes

32:50.260 --> 32:51.844
your things.

32:52.596 --> 32:53.929
- Balls.
- Yes.

32:54.014 --> 32:55.164
Balls?

32:55.891 --> 32:57.767
My grapes.

32:57.851 --> 32:58.934
Your grapes?

32:59.019 --> 33:00.169
My...

33:00.479 --> 33:02.188
Your testicles.

33:04.524 --> 33:07.193
Your sperm gets squozen,
and then you can't have babies,

33:07.277 --> 33:10.112
and I thought that
you said that you wanted to have babies.

33:11.239 --> 33:12.948
There you go. I said it.

33:16.036 --> 33:17.244
To babies!

33:18.664 --> 33:20.081
To diapers.

33:20.874 --> 33:22.024
To diaper rash.

33:22.959 --> 33:24.919
To breast-feeding. And to crying.

34:12.217 --> 34:13.384
Look at it!

34:14.928 --> 34:15.928
Do you see that?

34:16.096 --> 34:17.246
What?

34:17.681 --> 34:19.431
This letter has three typing errors in it,

34:19.516 --> 34:21.766
one of which is, I believe, a spelling error.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.812
I'm... I'm sorry.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.156
This isn't the first time, either.

34:26.273 --> 34:28.940
There've been others that I let go
because it was in the first few weeks.

34:29.025 --> 34:30.860
This cannot go on.

34:30.944 --> 34:34.029
Do you know what this makes me look like
to the people who receive these letters?

34:34.114 --> 34:36.866
I... I'm sorry. I'm...

34:36.992 --> 34:40.202
Type it again and get it right.

34:57.971 --> 34:59.889
You're wasting my time.

35:42.015 --> 35:43.165
Bye.

35:59.032 --> 36:01.700
Go type up a bill for that woman for $500.

36:01.785 --> 36:03.786
Aren't you going to proofread the letter?

36:21.096 --> 36:22.304
Lee.

36:26.434 --> 36:28.352
When people come into this office,

36:28.436 --> 36:31.772
you are a visual representation
of my business.

36:31.857 --> 36:34.358
And the way you dress is disgusting.

36:39.489 --> 36:40.489
I'm sorry.

36:40.574 --> 36:44.034
You're tapping your toe all the time
and playing with your hair.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.078
You're either going to
have to wear a hairnet

36:46.162 --> 36:47.872
or stop playing with your hair.

36:52.127 --> 36:53.794
And another thing,

36:54.880 --> 36:58.048
do you realize that
you are always sniffling?

36:58.633 --> 37:00.968
I... I'm sniffling?

37:01.928 --> 37:04.179
And what is with your tongue

37:05.015 --> 37:06.765
when you're typing?

37:08.018 --> 37:10.436
I'm sorry.
I didn't know I sniffled.

37:12.439 --> 37:14.773
Well, you do.

37:22.365 --> 37:23.616
Mr. Grey,

37:25.368 --> 37:30.289
thank you so much for
your helpful suggestions.

37:31.917 --> 37:34.793
Because I am trying to be

37:36.713 --> 37:39.632
the very best secretary that I can be.

37:41.217 --> 37:42.468
For you.

37:43.553 --> 37:45.471
The sentence should read,

37:45.555 --> 37:49.350
"Without proper guidance
from a knowledgeable source,

37:49.517 --> 37:51.810
"my client would never have made

37:51.937 --> 37:55.648
"these material decisions on her own."
Period!

37:56.066 --> 37:57.650
I have repeated the sentence twice.

37:59.235 --> 38:02.947
Why don't you listen, think
and then respond.

38:03.573 --> 38:04.907
Okay?

38:13.458 --> 38:15.459
Are you sure
you wouldn't like some wine?

38:16.127 --> 38:18.754
We make it homemade, don't we, Stewart?

38:19.214 --> 38:20.381
Try it. It's good.

38:20.465 --> 38:22.007
Would you like some, Lee?

38:22.801 --> 38:24.301
No, thank you.

38:24.469 --> 38:26.053
Not right now, Sylvia.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.597
You know,
Peter talks about you all the time.

38:28.682 --> 38:31.183
He says he's found his soul mate.

38:33.144 --> 38:34.770
Did you say that?

38:37.482 --> 38:38.440
I did.

38:38.525 --> 38:40.693
Peter's sister, Lindsey,

38:41.152 --> 38:44.196
is getting married this
coming winter in Vegas.

38:45.740 --> 38:48.534
Did you know Peter has
a very stable job at JC Penney?

38:48.994 --> 38:50.369
They even gave him a cell phone.

38:50.453 --> 38:52.287
Perhaps it'll be a double wedding?

38:56.668 --> 38:57.835
Mom.

39:22.068 --> 39:25.070
Ms. Holloway, come into the library.

39:26.573 --> 39:27.948
Immediately.

39:44.090 --> 39:46.842
"Refer only to slanderous remarks
made in print.

39:46.926 --> 39:48.260
"In summation of the events

39:48.344 --> 39:52.139
"in regard to the Rubin Berkowitz libel.
Yours sincerely, etc."

39:56.770 --> 39:57.920
Okay.

39:59.481 --> 40:01.273
The phone is ringing.

40:06.780 --> 40:07.930
Answer it.

40:10.950 --> 40:12.100
I'm sorry...

40:19.042 --> 40:20.192
Oh.

40:23.213 --> 40:24.379
Hello?

40:24.672 --> 40:26.465
This is the office of...

40:26.549 --> 40:27.699
Listen.

40:27.801 --> 40:28.884
You're a big girl.

40:28.968 --> 40:32.971
You can get a much bigger voice
out of that tiny throat of yours.

40:34.349 --> 40:35.499
Tiny.

40:36.434 --> 40:37.584
Ms. Holloway.

40:37.769 --> 40:39.770
You told me when I hired you

40:39.854 --> 40:42.356
that you were used to answering phones.

40:43.274 --> 40:44.424
I am.

40:45.068 --> 40:47.361
Did you get enough sleep last night?

40:47.946 --> 40:49.780
- I...
- The phone is ringing!

40:53.243 --> 40:54.409
Hello.

40:55.495 --> 40:59.206
This is the office of Mr. E. Edward Grey.

40:59.415 --> 41:02.459
You see? You see?
You see? You see?

41:02.544 --> 41:04.419
That's showing a little spunk.

41:04.504 --> 41:06.338
After all, I'm not running a mortuary.

41:06.756 --> 41:07.906
No.

41:18.518 --> 41:19.668
Lee.

41:21.104 --> 41:22.354
Mr. Grey.

41:25.441 --> 41:26.591
Come here.

41:53.511 --> 41:55.596
Did you have a date recently?

41:59.726 --> 42:00.876
Yes.

42:03.730 --> 42:05.564
With whom did you have a date?

42:07.400 --> 42:09.401
- Peter.
- Peter?

42:09.485 --> 42:10.944
Did you have sex?

42:14.407 --> 42:15.557
No?

42:18.453 --> 42:19.912
I don't know.

42:23.458 --> 42:24.875
Are you shy?

42:27.462 --> 42:28.712
I'm shy.

42:30.006 --> 42:31.548
You're not shy.

42:32.091 --> 42:33.717
You're a lawyer.

42:36.888 --> 42:38.096
I'm shy.

42:39.224 --> 42:41.099
I overcome my shyness to...

42:44.020 --> 42:46.104
Ln order to get things done.

42:48.524 --> 42:50.484
I don't think you're shy.

42:55.865 --> 42:58.200
Lee, I want to be frank with you.

42:58.284 --> 43:02.621
Now, I know I'm your employer,
and we have

43:03.164 --> 43:05.165
a prescribed relationship.

43:09.170 --> 43:13.298
But you really should feel free

43:16.511 --> 43:19.179
to discuss your problems with me.

43:22.475 --> 43:23.625
Oh.

43:30.817 --> 43:33.694
What's going on
with the sewing kit and the Band-Aids?

43:41.286 --> 43:42.436
Lee?

43:46.791 --> 43:48.041
I feel...

43:51.004 --> 43:52.254
- Shy.
- Shy.

43:56.467 --> 43:58.093
Do you want some hot chocolate?

43:59.053 --> 44:00.203
Okay.

44:15.236 --> 44:17.362
Why do you cut yourself, Lee?

44:22.744 --> 44:24.202
I don't know.

44:25.538 --> 44:28.123
Is it that sometimes the pain inside has to
come to the surface,

44:28.207 --> 44:30.417
and when you see evidence
of the pain inside,

44:30.793 --> 44:33.462
you finally know you are really here?

44:33.546 --> 44:35.714
Then, when you watch the wound heal,

44:35.882 --> 44:38.216
it's comforting. Isn't it?

44:41.387 --> 44:42.537
I...

44:46.851 --> 44:48.518
That's a way to put it.

44:49.395 --> 44:52.647
I'm going to tell you something, Lee.
Are you ready to listen?

44:53.858 --> 44:55.008
Yes.

44:55.193 --> 44:56.860
Are you listening?

45:00.156 --> 45:01.406
You will never,

45:02.325 --> 45:05.994
ever cut yourself again.

45:06.579 --> 45:08.246
Do you understand?

45:09.165 --> 45:11.500
Have I made that perfectly clear?

45:12.877 --> 45:14.669
You're over that now.

45:15.588 --> 45:17.214
It's in the past.

45:23.596 --> 45:24.746
Yes.

45:28.267 --> 45:29.684
Never again.

45:33.147 --> 45:34.297
Okay.

45:36.025 --> 45:39.486
Now, you know what I want you to do?

45:42.031 --> 45:44.282
I want you to leave work early.

45:46.119 --> 45:48.245
You're a big girl, a grown woman.

45:48.329 --> 45:50.144
Your mother doesn't need
to pick you up every day.

45:51.457 --> 45:56.378
I want you to take a nice walk home,
in the fresh air.

45:56.712 --> 45:58.630
Because you require relief.

45:59.006 --> 46:02.634
Because you won't be doing that anymore.

46:03.052 --> 46:04.428
Will you?

46:05.513 --> 46:06.763
No, sir.

46:08.975 --> 46:10.125
Good.

46:25.283 --> 46:26.825
Look who's early.

46:28.661 --> 46:29.828
Mom,

46:31.998 --> 46:34.416
I'm going to walk home from now on.

46:36.544 --> 46:39.296
I took a shortcut through Hawkins Park,

46:39.714 --> 46:44.301
and it was as if I'd never
taken a walk by myself before.

46:44.844 --> 46:50.015
And when I thought about it, I realized
I probably never had taken a walk alone.

46:50.600 --> 46:53.768
But because he had given me
the permission to do this,

46:53.853 --> 46:56.104
because he'd insisted I do it,

46:56.189 --> 47:00.901
I felt held by him as I walked along.

47:01.944 --> 47:03.820
I felt he was with me.

47:05.323 --> 47:10.952
At the same time, I was feeling
something growing in Mr. Grey,

47:11.704 --> 47:16.541
an intimate tendril creeping
from one of his darker areas,

47:17.210 --> 47:22.589
nursed on the feeling that he had
discovered something about me.

47:24.675 --> 47:28.136
The next day, I didn't even bring
my cuticle scissors and my iodine.

47:28.221 --> 47:31.014
But I did make another typing mistake.

47:31.224 --> 47:34.434
What is wrong with you?
That is all you have to do.

47:34.519 --> 47:37.270
Type and answer the phones.
Is that beyond you?

47:37.355 --> 47:39.648
- I'm sorry.
- Well, it certainly seems to be.

47:39.732 --> 47:42.150
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize to me!

47:42.235 --> 47:46.071
What goes on inside that head of yours?

48:35.580 --> 48:38.373
Come into my office and bring that letter.

48:51.637 --> 48:53.638
Put the letter on my desk.

49:04.817 --> 49:08.778
Now, I want you to bend over the desk,
so you're looking directly at it.

49:10.656 --> 49:15.035
Get your face very close to the letter,
and read the letter aloud.

49:16.829 --> 49:18.747
I don't understand.

49:19.665 --> 49:21.499
There's nothing to understand.

49:22.251 --> 49:25.211
Put your elbows on the desk, bend over,

49:26.088 --> 49:29.674
get your face close to the letter
and read it aloud.

49:41.687 --> 49:42.937
"Dear Mr. Garvey,

49:43.856 --> 49:46.399
"I'm grateful to you for referring..."

49:58.788 --> 50:00.038
Continue.

50:02.291 --> 50:03.441
Um...

50:04.835 --> 50:06.544
Ms. Holloway, read.

50:19.308 --> 50:21.851
"For referring me to your case.

50:24.230 --> 50:28.692
"The subject of animal captivity
has been of interest to me for quite a while.

50:29.443 --> 50:33.029
"And my secretary has prepared
research material

50:33.739 --> 50:36.157
"that I think you'll find illuminating.

50:36.826 --> 50:38.451
"If you would be so kind

50:41.080 --> 50:44.624
"as to send me the June 5th letter
of which we spoke,

50:45.418 --> 50:48.503
"my associates and I
will review it immediately."

50:50.256 --> 50:53.925
"Please feel free to call me
at your earliest convenience.

50:54.719 --> 50:58.263
"Yours sincerely, E. Edward Grey."

51:08.107 --> 51:09.524
Read it again.

51:15.614 --> 51:17.031
"Dear Mr. Garvey,

51:21.120 --> 51:23.121
"I am grateful to you

51:25.458 --> 51:27.542
"for referring me to your case.

51:27.918 --> 51:32.630
"The subject of animal captivity

51:39.013 --> 51:40.430
"for quite a while.

51:42.141 --> 51:45.810
"And my secretary has prepared
research material

51:48.856 --> 51:51.483
"that I think you'll find illuminating."

52:31.190 --> 52:33.399
Now straighten yourself up
and go type it again.

54:21.508 --> 54:24.177
Ms. Holloway. Good letter.

54:44.573 --> 54:45.723
Mom?

54:47.534 --> 54:50.161
The lock can come off the cabinet now.

54:59.213 --> 55:00.546
Honey.

55:41.296 --> 55:44.674
- Oh!

56:07.072 --> 56:10.199
Replace the light bulb
in the hallway to my office.

56:11.910 --> 56:13.060
120 watts.

56:13.662 --> 56:15.788
- Mr. Grey.
- Good to see you again, Mr. Garvey.

56:15.873 --> 56:18.249
You remember my secretary, Ms. Holloway.

56:18.333 --> 56:19.751
I'm sorry about the typo.

56:30.763 --> 56:35.600
It's porterhouse steak,
mashed, no, creamed potatoes,

56:35.976 --> 56:39.854
green peas, iced tea and ice cream.

56:40.105 --> 56:43.357
Okay. Just a scoop of creamed potatoes,

56:43.734 --> 56:48.863
and a slice of butter, four peas

56:50.282 --> 56:52.950
and as much ice cream
as you'd like to eat, doll.

57:33.492 --> 57:38.830
Cosmo's advice for getting your man
to share his feelings more intimately

57:39.206 --> 57:41.958
is to first try some breezy humor.

57:43.127 --> 57:48.297
Whatever you do, don't jump
too quickly into relationship talk.

59:08.086 --> 59:12.548
I'm your secretary.

59:12.716 --> 59:15.801
Just one scoop of creamed potatoes,

59:16.970 --> 59:18.763
one slice of butter,

59:19.681 --> 59:23.100
and four peas.

59:28.440 --> 59:30.399
How many inches away...

59:32.152 --> 59:35.238
Had you turned off the furnace
before you went down to the basement?

59:44.498 --> 59:45.648
Okay.

59:47.084 --> 59:49.794
Maybe you didn't squeeze it hard enough.

59:51.004 --> 59:53.506
Well, there's
always concern about it bursting.

59:57.177 --> 01:00:00.263
No! God, no.
I haven't had time to get to that.

01:00:01.473 --> 01:00:03.975
I'm doing as much as I possibly can.

01:00:09.648 --> 01:00:12.942
Where was she when
you crawled under the house?

01:00:16.655 --> 01:00:20.116
And the lockbox?
Did you cover it with dirt before you left?

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:21.826
Mud upstairs?

01:00:24.329 --> 01:00:26.289
No, I'm confused by that.

01:00:26.957 --> 01:00:28.165
But...

01:00:29.334 --> 01:00:33.254
All right. This was the overweight child,
or your nephew from Baltimore?

01:00:34.339 --> 01:00:35.923
On the banister.

01:00:43.682 --> 01:00:45.224
I have to work.

01:00:48.979 --> 01:00:52.148
Okay. Give me a week
and I'll have something for you.

01:00:52.232 --> 01:00:54.275
I'm sorry, the office has been

01:00:57.404 --> 01:00:58.821
overwhelmed.

01:01:01.867 --> 01:01:04.368
Mr. Grey, I'm going to go home now.

01:01:04.995 --> 01:01:10.207
If you need any more typing done,
I could come back later.

01:01:16.048 --> 01:01:18.549
Thank you, Ms. Holloway, good night.

01:01:26.767 --> 01:01:28.267
That'll be all.

01:01:34.399 --> 01:01:36.150
Here's just one example.

01:01:36.234 --> 01:01:40.112
He asked me out to Red Lobster
the other night for a nightcap.

01:01:40.322 --> 01:01:41.489
- Right.
- Yeah.

01:01:41.573 --> 01:01:44.700
And yesterday,
he asked if my hose were control-top,

01:01:44.785 --> 01:01:47.286
and if they were, I certainly didn't need it.

01:01:47.579 --> 01:01:49.580
- Your boss?
- Yeah.

01:01:49.873 --> 01:01:52.750
You should sue him for sexual harassment.

01:01:52.918 --> 01:01:55.044
- I like that idea.
- Hello.

01:01:55.128 --> 01:01:59.256
My lawyer's representing a woman who's
suing her boss for sexual harassment.

01:01:59.341 --> 01:02:01.092
Is he a good lawyer?

01:02:02.177 --> 01:02:04.095
He's the best.

01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:06.263
"He's the best."

01:02:06.348 --> 01:02:08.599
How long will he be there?

01:02:15.315 --> 01:02:16.774
Who was that?

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:19.568
He checked himself into the hospital.

01:02:46.012 --> 01:02:47.162
Lee?

01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:20.379
Yes? Lee?

01:03:22.757 --> 01:03:23.907
Hi.

01:03:27.596 --> 01:03:28.746
I...

01:03:30.432 --> 01:03:32.141
I just wanted...

01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:37.313
I needed you...

01:03:39.274 --> 01:03:41.192
I wanted you to...

01:03:44.863 --> 01:03:46.655
You need me to what?

01:03:54.372 --> 01:03:58.501
I just wanted you not to forget
to go over the Lynch papers for tomorrow.

01:04:02.088 --> 01:04:03.589
No. I haven't.

01:04:05.217 --> 01:04:06.634
That's good.

01:04:10.222 --> 01:04:11.514
Thank you, Lee.

01:05:01.064 --> 01:05:05.234
After he turned me away from his house,
he put me back at my old desk,

01:05:05.318 --> 01:05:08.112
and he just stopped doing it.

01:05:09.239 --> 01:05:11.657
He threw out all his red pens.

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:18.789
I kept making typos, but he just
treated me like a regular old secretary.

01:05:19.499 --> 01:05:20.749
Are you coming?

01:05:20.875 --> 01:05:24.878
After a while,
I began to wonder if that was all I was.

01:05:28.466 --> 01:05:30.593
Have we received
any checks from Mr. Garvey?

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.177
No, sir.

01:05:33.638 --> 01:05:35.014
File these.

01:05:44.649 --> 01:05:49.028
That's a pretty tie.
But I guess you won't be golfing today.

01:05:49.487 --> 01:05:50.637
What?

01:05:50.947 --> 01:05:52.197
Your tie.

01:05:52.574 --> 01:05:54.366
It has golfers on it.

01:06:01.124 --> 01:06:02.274
Right.

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:07.171
Damn it.

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:16.568
Don't be scared.

01:09:19.322 --> 01:09:20.781
I'm not. I'm...

01:09:32.042 --> 01:09:33.710
That's not what I meant.

01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:41.218
I'm sorry, I just... Look here.

01:09:43.136 --> 01:09:44.470
I'm sorry.

01:09:46.099 --> 01:09:49.725
Okay, but my clothes
get to stay completely on

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:51.687
and I want the lights out.

01:10:21.718 --> 01:10:23.886
Lee, Lee, Lee.

01:10:29.934 --> 01:10:31.476
I didn't hurt you, did I?

01:10:34.105 --> 01:10:35.255
No.

01:12:08.241 --> 01:12:09.491
Ms. Holloway.

01:12:12.203 --> 01:12:13.704
Yes, Mr. Grey?

01:12:13.955 --> 01:12:15.706
Come into my office.

01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:20.377
But Mr. Marvel is waiting.

01:12:23.381 --> 01:12:26.049
Ms. Holloway, come into my office.

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:27.551
Yes, sir.

01:12:30.096 --> 01:12:31.847
Finally.

01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:10.594
Ignore it.

01:13:27.195 --> 01:13:29.112
Now, pull up your skirt.

01:13:32.075 --> 01:13:33.225
Why?

01:13:34.494 --> 01:13:37.162
You're not worried
that I'm going to fuck you, are you?

01:13:38.748 --> 01:13:41.666
I'm not interested in that, not in the least.

01:13:42.335 --> 01:13:44.252
Now, pull up your skirt.

01:13:45.797 --> 01:13:47.464
Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee

01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:52.385
Lee?

01:13:55.932 --> 01:13:57.974
I said, pull up your skirt.

01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:02.270
Peter.

01:14:03.981 --> 01:14:07.484
I'm not going to be able to
come to the diner today, okay?

01:14:11.531 --> 01:14:12.681
Okay.

01:14:13.991 --> 01:14:17.702
That's okay.
Because... That's all right.

01:14:42.186 --> 01:14:44.855
Pull down your panty hose and underwear.

01:14:49.986 --> 01:14:52.529
I told you I'm not going to fuck you.

01:17:46.579 --> 01:17:48.371
Get these forms filled out,

01:17:48.873 --> 01:17:51.458
and then you can take your lunch break.

01:17:52.001 --> 01:17:56.004
Bring me my sandwich, I'm eating in.

01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:02.802
And you'll have the usual.

01:18:06.432 --> 01:18:08.350
No mayonnaise this time.

01:18:09.477 --> 01:18:13.855
And send in what's his name.

01:18:20.404 --> 01:18:21.554
Okay?

01:19:08.119 --> 01:19:09.786
Mr. Grey.

01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:35.103
Cock. Place your prick in my mouth.

01:19:35.729 --> 01:19:37.272
Screw me.

01:19:56.333 --> 01:19:58.501
Shit. Fuck.

01:19:59.503 --> 01:20:02.130
Mayonnaise. Orchid.

01:20:03.883 --> 01:20:05.341
Mr. Grey.

01:20:28.699 --> 01:20:30.200
Edward.

01:20:50.095 --> 01:20:54.349
Most people think that
the best way to live is to run from pain.

01:20:54.892 --> 01:20:58.895
But a much more joyful life
embraces the entire spectrum

01:20:58.979 --> 01:21:00.605
of human feeling.

01:21:00.898 --> 01:21:05.068
If we can fully
experience pain, as well as pleasure,

01:21:05.361 --> 01:21:09.239
we can live a much deeper
and more meaningful life.

01:21:57.121 --> 01:21:58.746
- Ms. Holloway.

01:22:02.167 --> 01:22:03.376
Yes, sir?

01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:05.962
- Bring your typing scores.
- Okay.

01:22:30.321 --> 01:22:31.821
What happened?

01:22:34.408 --> 01:22:35.908
Are you pregnant?

01:22:38.579 --> 01:22:39.729
No.

01:22:41.332 --> 01:22:43.666
- Do you plan on getting pregnant?
- Could I...

01:22:43.751 --> 01:22:45.835
Do you plan on getting pregnant?

01:22:47.796 --> 01:22:48.946
No.

01:22:49.465 --> 01:22:51.674
Are you living in an apartment?

01:22:51.884 --> 01:22:53.134
A house.

01:22:53.969 --> 01:22:55.136
Alone?

01:22:56.013 --> 01:22:57.555
With my parents.

01:22:59.183 --> 01:23:00.808
Are you married?

01:23:02.645 --> 01:23:03.795
No.

01:23:13.947 --> 01:23:15.198
Are those your scores?

01:23:16.992 --> 01:23:18.142
Yes.

01:23:24.917 --> 01:23:27.543
Do you really want to be my secretary?

01:23:30.422 --> 01:23:31.756
Yes, I do.

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:40.556
This isn't just about typos, tape,
staples and pencils, is it, Lee?

01:23:41.392 --> 01:23:43.393
- No, sir.
- What?

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:46.062
No, sir.

01:23:51.068 --> 01:23:54.987
I like you, Lee, but I don't think
I'm going to offer you the job.

01:23:57.741 --> 01:23:58.891
Why?

01:24:00.744 --> 01:24:02.495
It's your behavior.

01:24:04.581 --> 01:24:06.457
What about my behavior?

01:24:06.583 --> 01:24:08.084
It's very bad.

01:24:12.589 --> 01:24:16.134
I'm sorry.
You can collect your things.

01:24:17.511 --> 01:24:19.595
- Time-out!
- Time-out?

01:24:19.763 --> 01:24:21.681
- You're fired.
- You're fired!

01:24:21.765 --> 01:24:24.434
You're fired. Now, Lee, get out!

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:35.737
Why did you get glue smear
all over the Ramsey papers?

01:24:35.988 --> 01:24:38.573
Because I was fixing your shredder.
You saw me.

01:24:38.657 --> 01:24:41.868
Are you aware
you kick your shoes off under your desk?

01:24:41.952 --> 01:24:43.661
I can smell your feet.

01:24:43.746 --> 01:24:45.371
Do you ever change your panty hose?

01:24:45.456 --> 01:24:46.606
Every day.

01:24:46.749 --> 01:24:50.710
Every time you erase,
there are little shavings all over your desk.

01:24:50.961 --> 01:24:54.422
I told you to take that Walkman home.

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:58.676
I don't want the possibility
of your listening to music

01:24:58.761 --> 01:25:00.386
when you're supposed
to be working for me.

01:25:00.471 --> 01:25:04.015
I saw it in your desk. I know it's there.

01:25:04.433 --> 01:25:05.892
I'll move it.

01:25:46.058 --> 01:25:48.351
You have to go, or I won't stop.

01:25:49.686 --> 01:25:50.853
Don't.

01:25:54.566 --> 01:25:56.567
I cannot do this anymore.

01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:01.656
But I want to know you.

01:26:28.058 --> 01:26:30.810
I'm so sorry for what happened between us.

01:26:32.062 --> 01:26:37.900
I've realized
what a terrible mistake I made with you.

01:26:39.862 --> 01:26:43.114
And I can only hope that you understand.

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:48.411
Be assured you can count on me
for excellent references.

01:26:53.250 --> 01:26:58.087
Get out.

01:26:58.589 --> 01:27:01.173
- What are you doing...
- Get out!

01:28:16.875 --> 01:28:20.044
I opened the envelope
the second I got home.

01:28:20.212 --> 01:28:25.341
It was a check for $680.
More than he actually owed me.

01:28:25.801 --> 01:28:29.095
It occurred to me to tear up the check,
but I didn't.

01:28:29.721 --> 01:28:32.348
I felt like I was doing the right thing.

01:28:32.432 --> 01:28:35.226
And I didn't tell anybody about any of it.

01:28:36.478 --> 01:28:38.896
I pretended to go to work as usual,

01:28:39.481 --> 01:28:42.483
and watched his office
from across the street.

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:46.988
He hired a new girl
and changed the locks on the doors.

01:28:49.199 --> 01:28:52.159
There was just nothing
for me to do about it.

01:29:02.879 --> 01:29:08.926
My doctor at the institution once said,
"Every journey begins with the first step."

01:29:09.636 --> 01:29:13.264
So I decided it was time
to meet someone new.

01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:18.394
There was one who tried
to grab and pinch my nipples

01:29:18.478 --> 01:29:20.813
before we even made it to his car.

01:29:21.148 --> 01:29:22.148
Hi.

01:29:22.232 --> 01:29:25.359
Another guy kept ordering me
to pee on his patio,

01:29:25.444 --> 01:29:27.403
and when I refused, he said...

01:29:27.487 --> 01:29:29.071
I thought you were a masochist.

01:29:29.197 --> 01:29:32.241
Then there was the one
who liked being tied to a gas stove

01:29:32.409 --> 01:29:36.328
while the burners were on full blast,
and I had to throw tomatoes at him.

01:29:36.413 --> 01:29:37.663
Thank you.

01:29:37.748 --> 01:29:41.083
For a while I just stopped trying
and stayed at home,

01:29:41.418 --> 01:29:44.086
helping Dad adjust to his new sobriety.

01:29:44.921 --> 01:29:46.380
Until one day,

01:29:46.673 --> 01:29:50.342
out of the blue,
Peter proposed marriage to me

01:29:50.427 --> 01:29:52.845
in the basement of JC Penney's.

01:29:54.097 --> 01:29:57.600
I think I said yes
because I didn't know what else to do.

01:29:57.851 --> 01:30:01.228
Well, I guess I was a little lighter
than you in those days.

01:30:01.855 --> 01:30:03.064
Okay.

01:30:06.109 --> 01:30:08.402
Now, if you hold your breath
through the wedding, you'll make it.

01:30:08.487 --> 01:30:10.529
Don't move. I'm going to get Stewart.

01:30:10.614 --> 01:30:13.449
You're beautiful.
You're just too beautiful.

01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:39.100
Lee?

01:30:39.184 --> 01:30:41.769
No! I'm not supposed
to see you before the wedding!

01:30:41.853 --> 01:30:43.896
Where are you going?

01:30:59.162 --> 01:31:01.956
- I have something to say to you.
- Lee.

01:31:02.374 --> 01:31:03.749
I love you.

01:31:04.751 --> 01:31:06.877
Lee, you should not be here.

01:31:07.003 --> 01:31:08.337
I love you.

01:31:22.602 --> 01:31:25.688
I'm sorry,
but I don't believe that to be true.

01:31:26.148 --> 01:31:28.774
Well, it is true. Lt is.

01:31:31.862 --> 01:31:33.612
This matter was resolved

01:31:33.697 --> 01:31:36.740
when I received
your canceled severance check.

01:31:38.785 --> 01:31:40.161
I love you.

01:31:43.206 --> 01:31:46.208
We can't do this 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.

01:31:46.501 --> 01:31:47.751
Why not?

01:32:02.851 --> 01:32:05.561
Put both your hands on the desk.
Palms down.

01:32:14.362 --> 01:32:16.113
I want to make love.

01:32:23.079 --> 01:32:26.290
Keep both your feet on the floor
until I come back.

01:33:16.549 --> 01:33:17.549
Hello?

01:33:17.634 --> 01:33:20.803
In case you're wondering,
your fiancée is at my office.

01:33:54.796 --> 01:33:57.464
Lee, I'm very fond of you as well.

01:34:03.555 --> 01:34:05.931
Oh, it's you.

01:34:15.150 --> 01:34:16.984
What are you...
What are you doing?

01:34:17.068 --> 01:34:20.946
Lee, I don't...
I don't know what the deal is with...

01:34:21.364 --> 01:34:23.949
I'm sorry,
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

01:34:26.619 --> 01:34:28.704
I'm your fiancée, Lee!

01:34:28.830 --> 01:34:30.873
You are trespassing.

01:34:31.791 --> 01:34:34.626
You are making an unwarranted incursion,

01:34:34.711 --> 01:34:38.255
a gradual or stealthy
entrance into the sphere of another.

01:34:42.719 --> 01:34:44.553
Okay, Lee, Lee,

01:34:45.847 --> 01:34:51.226
are you doing something sexual right now?

01:34:52.395 --> 01:34:54.521
Does this look sexual to you?

01:34:57.108 --> 01:34:58.776
I don't know, Lee!

01:35:00.653 --> 01:35:02.363
Why don't you move your hands?

01:35:06.493 --> 01:35:08.410
Because I don't want to.

01:35:12.457 --> 01:35:13.607
No!

01:35:44.948 --> 01:35:49.701
Peter, I don't want you.

01:35:55.083 --> 01:35:56.542
Now, get out.

01:35:58.461 --> 01:35:59.670
Get out.

01:36:02.632 --> 01:36:03.799
Get out!

01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:43.630
- Here you go.
- Great.

01:36:45.216 --> 01:36:47.342
I brought you some peas.

01:36:52.182 --> 01:36:56.977
There are no statutes capable of controlling
the relations between men and women.

01:36:57.061 --> 01:36:59.188
There are other ways to show
your feelings, Lee.

01:37:00.023 --> 01:37:01.607
More conventional ways.

01:37:01.691 --> 01:37:05.694
I expect that dress back,
dry-cleaned, in perfect condition.

01:37:05.945 --> 01:37:09.114
I'm just going to leave you
with this literature.

01:37:10.450 --> 01:37:13.494
Why don't you read about
women's struggle first?

01:37:29.135 --> 01:37:33.597
You know, Lee, there's a long
history of this in Catholicism.

01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:37.684
The monks used to wear thorns
on their temples.

01:37:38.353 --> 01:37:41.772
And the nuns, they wore them
sewn inside their clothing.

01:37:41.856 --> 01:37:45.484
Two years ago, when it didn't work out
between us, that was it.

01:37:45.610 --> 01:37:47.528
I let him slip through my fingers.

01:37:47.612 --> 01:37:50.405
You are part of a great tradition.

01:37:50.490 --> 01:37:51.990
I admire you, Ms. Holloway.

01:37:52.116 --> 01:37:55.953
Without question, he is the most
isolated man I have ever known.

01:37:56.162 --> 01:37:58.205
The worm. Amazing.

01:37:58.331 --> 01:38:01.542
Who's to say that love needs to be
soft and gentle?

01:38:02.710 --> 01:38:06.088
"You are the child of God's holy gift of life.

01:38:07.423 --> 01:38:10.759
"You come from me, but you are not me.

01:38:12.595 --> 01:38:18.392
"Your soul and your body are your own,
and yours to do with as you wish."

01:38:21.938 --> 01:38:23.605
Thank you, Daddy.

01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:42.249
Drinks.

01:38:43.126 --> 01:38:44.585
Take what you ordered.

01:38:44.669 --> 01:38:47.796
Now don't take anybody else's drink.
What you ordered.

01:38:47.922 --> 01:38:53.594
<i>Fifty-seven bottles of beer on the wall</i>

01:38:55.138 --> 01:39:00.058
<i>Fifty-seven bottles of beer</i>

01:39:02.395 --> 01:39:04.730
<i>Take one down...</i>

01:39:19.829 --> 01:39:22.289
We're here on day three
of what has come to be known

01:39:22.373 --> 01:39:25.042
as the Lee Holloway hunger strike.

01:39:25.376 --> 01:39:28.211
Now, you may have heard
that there are those in the community

01:39:28.296 --> 01:39:32.090
who wonder if Ms. Holloway is even willing
to starve herself to death.

01:39:36.346 --> 01:39:39.514
In one way or another,
I've always suffered.

01:39:39.807 --> 01:39:41.850
I don't know why, exactly.

01:39:42.352 --> 01:39:46.438
But I do know that I'm not so scared
of suffering now.

01:39:47.148 --> 01:39:49.775
I feel more than I've ever felt,

01:39:50.026 --> 01:39:56.531
and I've found someone to feel with,
to play with, to love

01:39:57.784 --> 01:40:00.744
in a way that feels right for me.

01:40:01.663 --> 01:40:04.956
I hope he knows that
I can see that he suffers, too.

01:40:05.625 --> 01:40:07.751
And that I want to love him.

01:42:40.196 --> 01:42:46.701
Each cut, each scar, each burn,
a different mood or time.

01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:50.038
I told him what the first one was.

01:42:50.498 --> 01:42:53.208
I told him where the second one came from.

01:42:53.376 --> 01:42:55.252
I remembered them all.

01:42:56.337 --> 01:42:58.713
And for the first time in my life,

01:42:59.507 --> 01:43:01.800
I felt beautiful.

01:43:02.969 --> 01:43:05.011
Finally part of the earth.

01:43:06.347 --> 01:43:10.851
I touched the soil, and he loved me back.

01:43:32.456 --> 01:43:34.749
Where did you go to high school?

01:43:37.795 --> 01:43:39.838
What was your mother like?

01:43:42.091 --> 01:43:43.758
What was her name?

01:43:47.972 --> 01:43:52.893
What did it say under
your senior yearbook picture?

01:43:57.565 --> 01:43:59.524
Who was your first love?

01:44:03.529 --> 01:44:08.283
When did your heart first get broken?

01:44:14.832 --> 01:44:16.750
Where were you born?

01:44:25.593 --> 01:44:27.218
Des Moines, Iowa.

01:44:47.907 --> 01:44:52.869
All our activities melted
into an everyday sort of life

01:44:53.329 --> 01:44:56.539
until we looked like
any other couple you'd see.

01:44:57.333 --> 01:45:01.795
Turn that over, yes. Just pull it tight.

01:45:03.172 --> 01:45:06.257
Now, these pillows like to be stacked.

01:45:08.594 --> 01:45:10.345
Largest to smallest.

01:45:12.390 --> 01:45:14.224
We had a June wedding,

01:45:14.308 --> 01:45:17.018
by ourselves at the justice of the peace.

01:45:18.479 --> 01:45:21.064
Then, we honeymooned in the mountains.

01:45:21.774 --> 01:45:25.610
We only had the weekend
because Edward had to get back to work.
