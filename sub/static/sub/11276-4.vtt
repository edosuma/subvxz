00:05.200 --> 00:08.200
MAN ( <i>on radio</i> ):           
And we're on the help line      
            with...

00:08.300 --> 00:09.600
Oh, me.

00:09.600 --> 00:10.800
Me, hi.

00:10.800 --> 00:13.000
Uh, hello?

00:13.100 --> 00:14.800
My name is Reb...

00:14.900 --> 00:16.200
punzel.

00:16.200 --> 00:18.800
And uh, I'm sorry if I sound  
     a little bit nervous,

00:18.900 --> 00:20.100
but this is the first time

00:20.100 --> 00:22.000
I've ever called a radio show  
        for help.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.800
But I have this problem,    
     and it's so horrendous

00:24.800 --> 00:27.000
that I didn't have anyplace else
            to turn.

00:27.100 --> 00:28.900
Now, I have this new boss       
            at work,

00:28.900 --> 00:32.299
and he's incredibly rich    
 and he's incredibly powerful,

00:32.299 --> 00:34.400
but he is also sort of a, um...

00:34.400 --> 00:36.800
Oh, God, how could I put this  
     without sounding mean?

00:36.900 --> 00:39.800
Um... a weasely little twerp.

00:39.900 --> 00:41.200
Anyway, this guy asked me out,

00:41.300 --> 00:43.100
and to get out         
     of going out with him,

00:43.200 --> 00:46.100
I told him that I was going   
  with this guy named Sam...

00:46.100 --> 00:47.800
son.

00:47.800 --> 00:52.900
So, Samson, who can be     
 an incredible jerk sometimes,

00:53.000 --> 00:56.200
told my boss, the twerp,    
    that we broke up.

00:56.300 --> 00:57.300
All right, so my boss...

00:57.400 --> 00:58.400
The twerp.

00:58.400 --> 00:59.800
Right.

00:59.800 --> 01:03.000
My boss asked me out, and you're
not going to believe this.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.600
He proposed to me.

01:05.600 --> 01:08.000
I mean, the only thing      
    I could think of to do,

01:08.000 --> 01:10.700
without jeopardizing my career, 
      was to tell my boss

01:10.700 --> 01:12.800
that I was still in love    
          with Samson.

01:12.900 --> 01:15.400
But I cannot          
     keep avoiding the guy.

01:15.400 --> 01:18.000
As an example, he is upstairs  
right now having lunch at Mel...

01:18.000 --> 01:20.800
Monico's. Melmonico's.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.700
The thing is,          
     that now I'm worried.

01:22.700 --> 01:24.500
Do you think          
     I did the right thing?

01:24.500 --> 01:25.800
I think so.

01:25.900 --> 01:27.800
Now, did you have           
     a gardening question?

01:27.800 --> 01:30.500
You called              
the <i>Dr. Green Thumb Show.</i>

01:33.100 --> 01:36.300
Uh, just a reminder, <i>Rapunzel.</i>

Oh, yeah, I know, Norm,     
          that's a...

02:27.800 --> 02:29.400
that's a beautiful birdie       
  you got there on the ninth.

02:29.400 --> 02:30.500
Thank you.

02:30.500 --> 02:32.400
Oh, so you guys                 
were playing golf today, huh?

02:32.500 --> 02:35.300
Yeah, nothing like bashing
      the old pill around, huh?

02:35.400 --> 02:37.300
Young Woody Nicklaus here       
broke 80.

02:37.300 --> 02:39.100
All right; good man.            
                    Hey, really?

02:39.100 --> 02:40.900
You shot under 80           
    for 18 holes?

02:41.000 --> 02:43.300
Well, no actually, it was 17.

02:43.400 --> 02:44.600
Yeah, the 18th hole
                is the windmill.

02:44.700 --> 02:47.000
If you're stupid        
    enough to play that one,

02:47.100 --> 02:49.700
it's going to eat your
        little colored ball.

02:49.700 --> 02:51.100
You were playing                
miniature golf.

02:51.200 --> 02:52.200
Oh, yeah.

02:52.300 --> 02:53.600
Do you have any idea

02:53.600 --> 02:55.400
how long those real
              golf courses are?

02:55.500 --> 02:56.600
TEAL:   
                      Gentlemen,

02:56.700 --> 02:59.400
that was a pretty poor showing  
for a power lunch.

02:59.400 --> 03:01.900
Ralph, you're going to have     
to start doing something more

03:01.900 --> 03:04.200
than just taking up space       
    at these meetings.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.900
How does a guy so young

03:05.900 --> 03:08.000
get to be               
    so incredibly powerful?

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
I just try to maintain     
      a cheerful attitude

03:10.100 --> 03:12.400
and not abuse my position.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.600
I recently read a <i>Forbes</i> profile
     on our young Mr. Teal.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.200
CLIFF:
                    Oh, yeah?

03:16.200 --> 03:17.600
Apparently, he started      
    with his father's firm,

03:17.600 --> 03:19.500
kicked the old guy out     
        when he was 17,

03:19.600 --> 03:21.300
hasn't looked back since.       
Big deal.

03:21.400 --> 03:22.900
Did he ever win a purple ribbon

03:22.900 --> 03:25.900
in the Jefferson County     
        Spelldown?

03:25.900 --> 03:26.900
Anathema.

03:26.900 --> 03:29.100
A-N-A-T-H-E-M-A.

03:29.200 --> 03:30.800
Anathema.

03:30.900 --> 03:32.600
Touché, Woody.

03:32.700 --> 03:34.900
Touché. T-O-U-C-H-E,

03:35.000 --> 03:37.500
and a little slanty line--      
            touché.

03:38.900 --> 03:40.900
Excuse me.

03:40.900 --> 03:42.200
Is Miss Howe in?

03:42.200 --> 03:44.100
She's in her office;      
 do you want me to go get her?

03:44.100 --> 03:46.100
No, don't bother. Dennis?

03:53.200 --> 03:54.700
Miss Howe?

03:56.800 --> 04:00.000
Oh, no.     
     Oh, yes.

04:00.700 --> 04:02.300
The master of the universe

04:02.300 --> 04:03.700
awaits your presence.

04:05.700 --> 04:07.500
Dennis, I-I
            sense bitterness.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.600
I've never heard you    
          talk like this before.

04:09.600 --> 04:12.000
Oh, I could tell you stories,  
 honey.

04:13.300 --> 04:15.000
Here she is, sir,

04:15.000 --> 04:16.300
per your request.

04:16.399 --> 04:20.100
So, how's the greatest          
love story ever told            
working out?

04:20.100 --> 04:23.100
Sam and I are just  
            as steady as ever.

04:23.100 --> 04:25.900
As steady as yesterday          
when you broke up twice?

04:25.900 --> 04:27.300
Things are different.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.600
Uh... It's ...
              it's more serious.

04:29.700 --> 04:31.400
I won't consider it             
really serious

04:31.400 --> 04:33.200
until I see a ring              
on your finger.

04:33.200 --> 04:37.200
Well, what I meant  
            by serious is, um...

04:37.200 --> 04:39.300
is that Sam           
    and I are engaged.

04:39.300 --> 04:41.100
Hey, everybody.

04:41.100 --> 04:42.800
Congratulations,
                          Sammy.

04:42.900 --> 04:43.700
Oh? What for?

04:43.800 --> 04:45.500
She was just a stewardess.

04:47.700 --> 04:51.300
Stop joking,    
                you big lug,    
                and come here.

04:51.300 --> 04:53.300
Can you excuse us               
just a second, Martin?

04:53.300 --> 04:55.100
We have to discuss              
our silver pattern.

04:55.200 --> 04:58.600
Dennis, get me the papers       
on the Trackwell merger.

04:58.700 --> 05:01.800
Just keep your stupid           
mouth shut and smile.

05:01.800 --> 05:03.600
We're engaged.

05:03.700 --> 05:06.500
Oh. Great. Well,                
let's begin the honeymoon.

05:06.500 --> 05:09.600
Sam, we're      
                not actually    
                getting married.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.700
Well, that's even better.       
I can enjoy the honeymoon.

05:11.700 --> 05:13.100
Come on, Sam.

05:13.100 --> 05:16.100
It's just a way 
                to get Martin   
                off my back.

05:16.100 --> 05:20.000
Oh, dear... you mean            
the problem-free relationship

05:20.100 --> 05:22.400
suddenly                        
developed a glitch?

05:22.400 --> 05:24.900
I can't very well tell  
        the future president

05:25.000 --> 05:26.300
of the corporation no.

05:26.300 --> 05:27.600
I'd never work again.

05:27.700 --> 05:29.500
Please, Sam, just   
            help me out here

05:29.500 --> 05:31.300
just until Martin   
            gets over me.

05:32.200 --> 05:33.000
Come on.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.400
Oh, I don't know.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.800
You know, if I go   
            along with this,

05:36.800 --> 05:38.700
will you go     
                to bed with me?

05:40.100 --> 05:41.400
Let's put it this way.

05:41.400 --> 05:43.200
If you don't                    
go along with this,

05:43.200 --> 05:45.000
I will never go                 
to bed with you.

05:45.100 --> 05:48.300
Wait. All right.    
            So, in other words, 
            if I don't...

05:48.400 --> 05:51.100
No. Wait, wait.
            That means if you...

05:51.200 --> 05:52.600
All right,  
                    this is me,

05:52.700 --> 05:54.700
this is you,    
                this is the bed.

05:56.800 --> 05:58.000
Sam, just do it.

05:58.100 --> 06:00.100
No, I don't...

06:00.200 --> 06:01.700
Yeah, I don't   
                      personally

06:01.700 --> 06:03.900
think we need the   
            salad forks, honey,

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
but you're
                 the entertainer
                  in the family.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.600
Well, I suppose                 
congratulations are in order.

06:08.700 --> 06:10.200
Oh, well, thank you, sir.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.200
Yeah, I never          
  thought I'd get her, but...

06:12.200 --> 06:13.900
it looks like Becky here

06:13.900 --> 06:14.800
is going to be                  
my ever-loving,

06:14.800 --> 06:18.100
everlasting little              
bundle of kisses.

06:20.100 --> 06:24.400
Little bundle                   
of open-mouthed kisses.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.300
Isn't he sweet?

06:27.400 --> 06:30.200
I'd like to propose             
a toast to the happy couple,

06:30.200 --> 06:32.000
and especially                  
to Rebecca Howe--

06:32.000 --> 06:34.800
the only thing I ever      
wanted and haven't gotten.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.100
Yeah. Same here.

06:36.100 --> 06:40.400
Um... would you excuse me       
just for a minute, please?

06:40.500 --> 06:42.100
Hey, Sammy,

06:42.200 --> 06:45.800
quite a squeeze-a-rooni
             you got there, huh?
                  I had no idea.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.800
Oh, Sammy,              
     tell me it isn't true.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.700
Carla, come on.         
        It's not true.

06:49.700 --> 06:51.900
I knew that.          
     You're a lousy actor.

06:51.900 --> 06:53.900
I'm pretty good though, huh?

06:53.900 --> 06:56.100
Well, actually, Carla,
    as a student of the theater,

06:56.200 --> 06:57.300
I have to correct you.

06:57.300 --> 06:59.400
What you were doing there   
        is not called acting.

06:59.400 --> 07:00.700
It's called improvising.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.100
Shut up, Woody.

07:02.100 --> 07:04.900
Now, that would 
                be directing.

07:07.500 --> 07:10.000
So when's                       
the big event?

07:10.000 --> 07:12.100
Well, I was kind of 
            planning on tonight.

07:12.100 --> 07:13.300
You're getting married tonight?

07:13.300 --> 07:14.400
Married? Oh, no.
                I'm sorry.

07:14.500 --> 07:15.800
I thought you were talking
        about something else.

07:17.300 --> 07:20.700
It is definitely not            
going to be tonight.

07:20.700 --> 07:22.900
Look, the important             
thing is

07:22.900 --> 07:25.800
that we are as one          
          forevermore.

07:25.800 --> 07:27.500
Honeys till the end of time.

07:27.500 --> 07:28.500
Well, Sam,

07:28.600 --> 07:30.500
I guess             
you wouldn't be interested

07:30.500 --> 07:33.100
in spending the next month      
tending bar at a seaside resort

07:33.100 --> 07:34.600
we reopened in Cancun?

07:34.600 --> 07:35.400
I'm there.

07:35.400 --> 07:36.800
Whoa, hey.

07:36.800 --> 07:37.900
Sam!

07:38.000 --> 07:39.300
Oh, right. Yeah.

07:39.300 --> 07:41.300
Um, that wouldn't be fair       
        to Rebecca here.

07:41.300 --> 07:42.900
Who could we get        
         to replace me?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.300
Oh, no problem.

07:44.300 --> 07:46.500
I'll make an exchange      
 with the bartender down there.

07:46.500 --> 07:47.800
Well, then, I'm out of here.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.200
Hey, I'll see you in a month.

07:49.300 --> 07:50.700
Adios, amigos!

07:50.800 --> 07:51.500
REBECCA:                        
Sam?

07:51.600 --> 07:53.100
Sam!

07:53.100 --> 07:55.200
Sam!

07:58.800 --> 08:03.400
Martin, is this your little way 
of breaking Sam and me up?

08:03.500 --> 08:05.300
It's a bona 
                    fide offer.

08:05.300 --> 08:07.300
I need an       
                experienced     
                man down there.

08:07.300 --> 08:08.700
I know what                     
you're thinking.

08:08.800 --> 08:11.100
You're thinking that,           
when Sam gets down there,

08:11.200 --> 08:13.700
and he's all alone,             
he's going to start roving.

08:13.700 --> 08:15.000
Well, I can                     
tell you this.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.200
You can send Sam away           
for a month or a year,

08:17.300 --> 08:19.200
and he will                     
only think of me.

08:19.300 --> 08:20.600
Excuse me.

08:20.700 --> 08:22.800
Do they have drug stores    
          down there,

08:22.800 --> 08:24.800
or should I pack an extra bag?

08:36.100 --> 08:38.200
Ramon, Ramon, Ramon,

08:38.299 --> 08:41.600
you have been a terrific    
     replacement for Sammy.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.900
I'm really going to     
        be sorry to see you go.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.600
Although    
                    I will enjoy

08:46.600 --> 08:48.400
watching you walk   
                  up the stairs.

08:50.900 --> 08:54.700
( <i>speaking Spanish</i> )

08:54.700 --> 08:57.400

Mi Carlita...

08:59.800 --> 09:01.900
( <i>speaking Spanish</i> )

09:06.100 --> 09:07.700
Adios, amigos.

09:07.700 --> 09:08.700
Bye-bye.

09:08.700 --> 09:10.400
CLIFF:          
                Take care of    
                yourself, Ramon.

09:12.100 --> 09:14.400
I don't know what           
     that Latin lover said,

09:14.400 --> 09:16.700
but I sure dig         
      the way he said it.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Well, if you ask me,

09:20.100 --> 09:22.000
Ramon's a lot more Latin    
          than lover.

09:22.100 --> 09:23.300
Yeah, you know,

09:23.300 --> 09:25.000
study after 
                    study show

09:25.000 --> 09:27.200
that the old    
                sons of Spain

09:27.200 --> 09:30.200
just don't have     
            our sexual prowess.

09:30.300 --> 09:33.200
Cliffie, nobody         
    has your sexual prowess.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.000
Thanks, Norm. You know,

09:37.000 --> 09:38.500
it seems that   
                the tropical sun

09:38.500 --> 09:40.300
dries out a man's   
            vital juices.

09:41.700 --> 09:44.400
You ever        
                seen a raisin?

09:44.400 --> 09:46.600
Have you ever seen a doctor?

09:50.000 --> 09:52.300
Sam was supposed        
      to be in hours ago.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.700
Has anybody heard from him yet?

09:54.700 --> 09:57.800
No one's heard a word           
from him in weeks.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.800
Hello, Rebecca.

10:02.900 --> 10:04.500
Heard from                      
Sam recently?

10:04.600 --> 10:06.300
Have I?

10:06.300 --> 10:08.100
Every hour on the hour.

10:08.100 --> 10:10.100
It's almost embarrassing.

10:10.100 --> 10:11.300
Hmm. Well, then                 
what's happened

10:11.400 --> 10:12.400
seems all                       
the more curious.

10:12.500 --> 10:13.600
What's happened?

10:13.600 --> 10:15.200
According       
                to our reports,

10:15.300 --> 10:18.000
Mr. Malone missed       
        the corporate jet home.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.500
Uh... well, I'm sure      
 there's a simple explanation.

10:20.500 --> 10:22.300
I'll just call Cancun      
         this afternoon

10:22.300 --> 10:23.900
and find out          
      what the trouble is.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.400
We have Cancun on the line.

10:27.400 --> 10:29.900
You are so helpful.

10:29.900 --> 10:32.700
I am five months        
        from retirement.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.400
Hello.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.800
Sam, hi.        
                This is Rebecca.

10:36.800 --> 10:39.300
You must have   
              missed your plane,
                you naughty boy.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.300
So when should  
                I pick you up

10:41.300 --> 10:43.600
at the airport, 
                my darling? Sam?

10:43.600 --> 10:44.900
Sam?

10:44.900 --> 10:46.900
Hello?

10:47.000 --> 10:49.700
( <i>loud music playing</i> )

11:00.400 --> 11:02.900
Sam? Sam?

11:09.300 --> 11:11.000
Hello? Operator?

11:11.000 --> 11:12.800
O-operator?

11:12.800 --> 11:16.400
Yes, I was just talking     
    to my fiancé and I was...

11:16.500 --> 11:17.500
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:17.500 --> 11:23.000
Uh, me talk-o to me boy-o   
                amigo in Cancun,

11:23.000 --> 11:26.100
and we were cut off-o.

11:27.900 --> 11:31.500
It's a beautiful language,      
isn't it?

11:31.500 --> 11:34.100
What?           
                You no operator?

11:34.100 --> 11:35.500
You boose boy?

11:35.600 --> 11:37.000
Oh, bus boy.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.700
Yeah, okay, adios.

11:38.700 --> 11:40.400
No, no, adios.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.700
Damn.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.200
Thank you, Dennis.

11:44.700 --> 11:48.500
Rebecca, you're not       
    losing anything in Sam.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.300
I hear he hasn't stopped        
fooling around

11:50.300 --> 11:51.200
since he got down there.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.800
You had him watched?

11:52.900 --> 11:53.900
I didn't have to.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.400
The man's escapades             
have become legendary.

11:56.400 --> 11:59.800
The Indians in the mountains    
sing a folk song about him.

12:02.100 --> 12:05.700
Rebecca, let me help you take   
your mind off your problems.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.200
I'll pick you up for dinner,

12:07.200 --> 12:10.400
maybe a drink,                  
a trip to Paris, a few laughs.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.800
Martin, not tonight.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.800
I-I really need time
            to get over this.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.900
Well, then tomorrow night.

12:16.900 --> 12:19.200
I won't take no for an answer.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.800
I got him, I got him.

12:23.800 --> 12:26.800
I caught my little              
Ricardo Montalban.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.300
Just as he was                  
getting into a cab.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.700
Go get your                     
little apron on, honey.

12:31.700 --> 12:34.500
Carla, how come you called Ramon
    Ricardo Montalban?

12:34.600 --> 12:36.100
Because his tight little chinos

12:36.100 --> 12:39.300
are so packed with rich,    
      Corinthian leather.

12:42.300 --> 12:45.500
Oh, yeah, I see,                
now that you mention it.

12:45.600 --> 12:46.700
NORM:     
                      All right,

12:46.700 --> 12:48.000
I hate to change
                the subject,

12:48.000 --> 12:49.900
but I don't know            
    if anyone else recognizes

12:49.900 --> 12:51.600
we seem to have       
          a little problem here.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.600
Oh, you need          
  another beer, Mr. Peterson?

12:53.700 --> 12:57.300
Okay, we have two problems.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.800
Uh, there's           
     a distinct possibility

12:59.800 --> 13:01.300
that Sammy may never come back.

13:01.300 --> 13:02.600
FRASIER:          
              Frankly,          
              I don't blame him.

13:02.700 --> 13:04.700
Beautiful weather,              
miles of beaches...

13:04.800 --> 13:06.000
Yeah, chicks.

13:06.100 --> 13:06.800
FRASIER:                        
No suits,

13:06.800 --> 13:09.300
no rules, no tight shoes    
      to pinch your feet.

13:09.300 --> 13:10.400
Yeah, that'd be good

13:10.400 --> 13:12.300
to get out of the city     
a little bit, wouldn't it?

13:12.300 --> 13:13.800
Oh, yeah.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.500
I got five vacation days    
         coming to me.

13:15.500 --> 13:16.700
Oh, say, it may be
              a crazy idea,

13:16.700 --> 13:18.100
but why don't we   
             go down there, too?

13:18.200 --> 13:19.800
Lay out in the sun
              for a while,

13:19.800 --> 13:21.600
work on that old    
             <i>mañana</i> attitude?

13:21.600 --> 13:22.500
Should we do it?

13:22.500 --> 13:23.800
What do you say,                
guys?

13:26.300 --> 13:27.800
Ah, maybe tomorrow.

13:39.900 --> 13:42.300
can we get a couple of 
         pina coladas over here?

13:42.400 --> 13:43.400
Sure thing.

13:43.400 --> 13:44.500
Let me just finish              
making this margarita.

13:45.300 --> 13:47.600
So, anyway, Margarita...

good one.

Let's go, Sam.         
         We're leaving.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.600
I have a cab outside.

14:15.600 --> 14:18.200
Beckita, what          
      are you doing here?

14:18.200 --> 14:19.300
I took the liberty

14:19.300 --> 14:22.000
of stopping by your room    
     and packing your bags.

14:22.100 --> 14:24.500
I can't believe you didn't pack 
    one pair of underpants.

14:26.200 --> 14:27.600
Now come on, we're going home.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.900
Home? Sweetheart, I'm...

14:30.900 --> 14:31.900
This is home.

14:31.900 --> 14:33.500
I love this place.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.700
Sam, we are leaving       
    and we are leaving now.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.400
I am not going to           
     get stuck with Martin.

14:37.400 --> 14:38.700
Oh, right, right.

14:38.700 --> 14:40.000
The little one.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.300
Uh, sweetheart, yeah,      
    I got to tell you,

14:42.300 --> 14:44.200
I think it's high time      
    you told him the truth.

14:44.200 --> 14:45.200
I can't tell him the truth.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.800
I'll get fired.

14:46.800 --> 14:48.500
Well, they, uh,
                 they got plenty

14:48.500 --> 14:50.700
of good job opportunities       
        down here.

14:50.700 --> 14:53.400
Can you paint pictures          
on turtles?

14:55.000 --> 14:58.800
Sam, I am asking you, not       
 as a woman speaking to a man,

14:58.900 --> 15:00.400
I am asking you as a friend.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.500
Please, Sam.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.300
When you look back

15:03.300 --> 15:05.800
at all the countless,   
        selfish, petty,

15:05.800 --> 15:07.700
vindictive things you've
        done in your life,

15:07.800 --> 15:09.600
wouldn't it be wonderful
        if you could say

15:09.700 --> 15:13.400
for one brief moment  
          that you did something
          good and fine?

15:13.500 --> 15:15.700
This shouldn't be turning me on,
should it?

15:15.800 --> 15:17.000
Oh, that's it.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.200

to my pleas,

15:21.700 --> 15:23.000
maybe you'll listen             
to this.

15:23.100 --> 15:24.800
You're coming with me, Sam.

15:28.700 --> 15:30.100
Now let's not do

15:30.200 --> 15:31.900
anything crazy here.

15:31.900 --> 15:34.800
I bet you wish you had     
     those underpants now.

15:38.600 --> 15:42.800
Listen, I'm gonna just reach out
my hand here real slowly.

15:42.900 --> 15:47.000
I want you to relax 
            and take your finger
            off the trigger.

15:47.100 --> 15:48.700
Just put the gun in my hand.

15:50.900 --> 15:52.400
I'm sorry.              
        It's not loaded.

15:53.200 --> 15:54.700
I mean, I'm sorry, period.

15:54.700 --> 15:58.300
It's not loaded, period.

15:58.300 --> 16:00.300
It's-it's all right, everybody.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.300
It was just a... just a joke.

16:02.300 --> 16:03.600
( <i>all groaning</i> )

16:06.200 --> 16:07.300
I'm gonna go now.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.900
W-w-where do you think
          you're going?

16:09.000 --> 16:10.200
You can't just walk out of here.

16:10.300 --> 16:11.500
You pulled a gun on me

16:11.500 --> 16:13.500
in a resort in the middle       
     of a foreign country.

16:13.600 --> 16:15.500
They have laws,
                 you know?

16:15.600 --> 16:16.400
Don't they?

16:18.900 --> 16:21.100
Good-bye, Sam.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.800
<i>Pobrecita.</i>

16:25.800 --> 16:27.000
SAM:                            
Oh, no,

16:27.000 --> 16:28.400
she's like that all the time.

16:28.400 --> 16:30.300
I mean, this isn't even     
    a bad day for her.

16:30.400 --> 16:33.600
<i>¿Son todas las</i> babes <i>de Boston</i> 
     <i>locos como esta?</i>

16:33.700 --> 16:36.600
No, no-- she's kind of     
    the queen of loco.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.900
I mean, she was nutty      
    the first day I met her.

16:39.900 --> 16:40.900
She's... she's hyper.

16:40.900 --> 16:41.900
You know what I mean, hyper?

16:42.800 --> 16:44.000
All she thinks about

16:44.100 --> 16:45.400
is her stupid career

16:45.400 --> 16:46.500
and she keeps blowing it.

16:46.500 --> 16:47.900
And I can't tell you      
         how many times

16:47.900 --> 16:50.000
I've had to pull that      
  lady's fat out of the fire.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.200
Get this, you know.

16:52.300 --> 16:54.100
This is her latest escapade.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.500
She wants me to pretend         
to be her fiancé,

16:56.500 --> 16:58.000
'cause she doesn't              
want to marry

16:58.100 --> 17:00.700
this pint-size executive        
back home.

17:00.700 --> 17:02.200
What do I get                   
for my troubles?

17:02.200 --> 17:04.900
A gun stuck in my face.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.400
You know what                   
the sorriest thing is?

17:07.500 --> 17:08.700
Me.

17:08.800 --> 17:12.300
I still like her.

17:12.300 --> 17:13.900
Why is that, Pepe?

17:16.599 --> 17:18.000
Nice buns, Sammy?

17:20.200 --> 17:24.000
You people see things           
so clearly.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.300
Hey, uh, Ramon.

17:30.300 --> 17:32.800
Listen, we're heading over      
to <i>Casa de</i> Clavin

17:32.900 --> 17:35.400
for our weekly                  
video film classic.

17:35.500 --> 17:37.400
You want                        
to take Sammy's seat?

17:37.500 --> 17:38.500
I'm busy.

17:38.600 --> 17:39.500
Yeah, well,                     
I've got it rented

17:39.600 --> 17:40.400
for a couple of days.

17:40.500 --> 17:41.500
How about tomorrow night?

17:41.600 --> 17:44.100
Uh... I am busy.

17:44.100 --> 17:46.200
Yeah?           
Sorry.

17:46.300 --> 17:48.300
Yeah, well,                     
he's a nice guy, that Ramon,

17:48.300 --> 17:49.900
but he's no Sammy,              
is he, Norm?

17:50.000 --> 17:52.200
But then again, Cliffie...

17:53.600 --> 17:57.000
he's a lot more Sammy           
than you and I will ever be.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.600
Hey, boss, last of the riffraff 
just cleared out of here.

18:06.600 --> 18:07.500
You want to lock up?

18:10.100 --> 18:13.100
Sure, Carla, can you
            show me how a key   
            works again?

18:13.200 --> 18:16.500
Oh, brother, you been           
in there drinking all night?

18:16.500 --> 18:18.100
Carla, I am celebrating.

18:18.100 --> 18:22.100
I think that I am the luckiest 
      woman in the world.

18:22.100 --> 18:26.900
I'm going to marry              
the geek tycoon.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.100
And you know, he's going    
  to give me money and jewels

18:29.100 --> 18:31.800
and all sorts          
         of rich stuff.

18:31.800 --> 18:33.900
I am going to be so rich,       
          I can stink

18:34.000 --> 18:37.600
and no one        
              will even tell me.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.700
I'm sure you two                
will be very happy together.

18:39.800 --> 18:41.400
I'm sure I will, too.

18:41.500 --> 18:43.000
I'm gonna spend    
             the rest of my life

18:43.000 --> 18:44.300
living in big,
                  old mansions,

18:44.300 --> 18:45.900
wearing fabulous clothes

18:46.000 --> 18:49.700
and being real nasty
            to the help.

18:50.900 --> 18:52.800
You feeling sorry               
for yourself

18:52.800 --> 18:55.200
because you have                
to marry a rich guy?

18:55.300 --> 18:57.800
Boo-hoo, boo-hoo.

18:57.800 --> 18:59.000
Come on, Carla.

18:59.100 --> 19:01.100
You wouldn't trade
              Eddie for him.

19:01.200 --> 19:05.300
I'd trade Eddie                 
for a ride in his car.

19:05.300 --> 19:07.100
Now if you'll excuse me,

19:07.200 --> 19:10.500
I have a Spam casserole         
lurking in the oven.

19:13.900 --> 19:17.200
Hey, we're the same size.

19:25.600 --> 19:28.000
Hi, honey, you're home.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.200
See?

19:30.200 --> 19:33.100
Aren't I gonna make you
         a wonderful wife?

19:33.200 --> 19:34.600
You've been drinking,           
haven't you?

19:34.700 --> 19:37.800
Just a sippy or two
             to celebrate.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.300
Well, now that Sam's            
out of the picture,

19:39.300 --> 19:40.800
I assume that leaves            
the path clear for me.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.800
Shall we proceed?

19:42.900 --> 19:44.500
Rebecca...

19:44.600 --> 19:47.700
will you do me the honor        
of becoming my wife?

19:47.700 --> 19:50.400
I guess.

19:52.400 --> 19:53.400
Outstanding.

19:53.500 --> 19:54.600
Shall we set a date?

19:54.700 --> 19:56.900
Whenever. I don't care.

19:59.100 --> 20:00.900
You're about to see       
      my impulsive side.

20:06.100 --> 20:08.500
This is Justice     
            of the Peace Wilson,

20:08.500 --> 20:11.700
these are four dozen            
long-stemmed red roses.

20:11.800 --> 20:14.400
I'm the perspective             
bridegroom.

20:14.400 --> 20:15.700
Guess what you are?

20:15.800 --> 20:19.500
Dead meat 
                      on a hook?

20:19.500 --> 20:20.600
Um...

20:20.700 --> 20:22.900
Martin, you can't do this.

20:22.900 --> 20:25.100
My parents aren't here.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.800
Your parents aren't here.

20:27.900 --> 20:29.700
My mother passed away,

20:29.700 --> 20:32.000
and, uh,                        
you know my father.

20:37.400 --> 20:38.500
Dennis?

20:38.500 --> 20:41.300
Welcome to the family.

20:41.300 --> 20:43.400
MARTIN:                         
Rebecca,

20:43.500 --> 20:44.500
you should know by now

20:44.500 --> 20:46.000
that I haven't gotten           
where I am

20:46.000 --> 20:47.600
by waiting for things           
to come to me.

20:47.700 --> 20:50.400
As far as I'm concerned,        
this is a done deal.

20:50.400 --> 20:51.700
So let's make it legal.

20:51.700 --> 20:53.000
Hey, baby, I'm back!

20:53.000 --> 20:54.500
Call off the <i>Federales.</i>

20:54.500 --> 20:56.000
Sam!

20:56.000 --> 20:59.500
I couldn't stay away from you  
for another second, my darling.

20:59.600 --> 21:00.800
Kiss me.

21:10.500 --> 21:13.200
Oop...

21:13.200 --> 21:14.800
Hey, did I interrupt      
        something here?

21:14.800 --> 21:17.300
No, Martin and I
                were just going 
                to get married,

21:17.300 --> 21:18.800
but now that  
                  you're back...

21:18.900 --> 21:22.100
Oh... Martin.

21:22.100 --> 21:23.200
I'm so sorry.

21:24.700 --> 21:28.200
This is really      
            tearing me apart.

21:28.200 --> 21:30.800
But I need         
             to follow my heart.

21:30.900 --> 21:34.300
Well, if that's what you feel, 
    Rebecca, you've got it.

21:34.300 --> 21:37.100
I hope you two                  
will be very happy together.

21:37.100 --> 21:40.100
But remember: you blew it       
in a big, big way.

21:41.400 --> 21:45.000
I hope this won't affect    
our business relationship.

21:45.100 --> 21:47.600
Why should it?

21:49.200 --> 21:50.500
Gee, when I sober up,

21:50.600 --> 21:53.100
I'm probably going          
      to worry about this.

21:53.200 --> 21:55.900
Better not let that happen.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.800
I don't believe this.

22:00.800 --> 22:03.400
You came all the way back here 
          just for me?

22:04.400 --> 22:06.200
I just feel so terrible

22:06.300 --> 22:09.600
for everything I ever said      
         or did to you.

22:09.600 --> 22:13.700
Well, gee, now, there must be  
some way you can thank me.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.700
You're right, Sam.

22:16.800 --> 22:19.000
I think the time            
    has finally come.

22:19.100 --> 22:20.300
Yeah.

22:20.300 --> 22:23.100
You've waited long enough.

22:25.800 --> 22:26.800
Oh...

22:26.900 --> 22:28.800
Oh, no.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.600
That's funny.

22:34.600 --> 22:37.200
Usually they pass out      
          afterwards.

22:48.300 --> 22:49.900
No, no, no.

22:49.900 --> 22:51.700
I am a gentleman.

22:53.100 --> 22:55.900
But I may never         
    have this chance again.
