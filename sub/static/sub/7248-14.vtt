WEBVTT

00:05.120 --> 00:07.496
- Hello?
- Do you come bearing pizza?

00:07.580 --> 00:10.081
- I'm not an idiot.
- Then get in here.

00:11.291 --> 00:13.584
- Sit. You're missing it.
- What are we watching?

00:13.667 --> 00:15.710
The incomparable Donna Reed Show.

00:15.877 --> 00:18.128
- What's in there?
- A salad.

00:18.462 --> 00:19.587
Salad?

00:20.005 --> 00:24.174
It's a quaint dish sometimes used
to precede large quantities of pizza.

00:26.427 --> 00:28.553
- It's for me.
- Clearly.

00:29.637 --> 00:31.263
So, who's Donna Reed?

00:31.389 --> 00:33.890
- What?
- You don't know who Donna Reed is?

00:33.974 --> 00:36.600
The quintessential '50s mom
with the perfect '50s family?

00:36.684 --> 00:38.310
Never without a smile and high heels?

00:38.394 --> 00:40.645
Hair that if you hit with a hammer
would crack?

00:40.729 --> 00:43.105
- So, it's a show?
- It's a lifestyle.

00:43.189 --> 00:44.523
It's a religion.

00:44.606 --> 00:46.941
- My favorite episode...
- Tell me.

00:47.067 --> 00:51.445
...is when their son, Jeff, comes home
from school, and nothing happens.

00:51.695 --> 00:53.362
That's a good one.

00:53.655 --> 00:57.616
One of my favorites is when Mary,
the daughter, gets a part-time job...

00:57.699 --> 01:00.325
- and nothing happens.
- Another classic.

01:00.701 --> 01:02.577
So what's this one about?

01:02.661 --> 01:04.787
This one is actually quite filled
with intrigue.

01:04.870 --> 01:08.915
The husband, Alex, comes home
late for dinner, and he didn't call.

01:09.041 --> 01:10.792
Might as well kick the dog, too.

01:11.042 --> 01:12.584
Look, she's making doughnuts.

01:12.668 --> 01:15.920
...bind in the sugar department.
- I was thinking of something else.

01:16.004 --> 01:19.923
Not that my sugary attitude
wouldn't make anyone an instant diabetic.

01:20.007 --> 01:22.467
Mother-daughter window washing.
We should try that.

01:22.509 --> 01:24.635
Right after
mother-daughter shock treatments.

01:24.719 --> 01:28.471
There's nothing more satisfying
than washing windows. Oh, no.

01:28.555 --> 01:30.306
What? Did I miss a spot?

01:30.390 --> 01:33.684
No, I just had an impure thought
about your father, Alex.

01:33.767 --> 01:37.311
Funny, I don't know why I had it.
It isn't the second Saturday of the month.

01:37.395 --> 01:39.563
I heard you had
an impure thought about me.

01:39.646 --> 01:41.939
I must now sublimate
all my impure thoughts...

01:42.023 --> 01:45.817
by going into the kitchen and making
an endless string of perfect casseroles.

01:45.901 --> 01:49.111
- You're not even listening to the dialogue.
- Ours is better.

01:49.195 --> 01:51.696
I don't know,
it all seems kind of nice to me.

01:51.780 --> 01:52.864
What does?

01:52.948 --> 01:56.950
Families hanging together,
a wife cooking dinner for her husband.

01:57.159 --> 02:00.119
- And look, she seems really happy.
- She's medicated.

02:00.203 --> 02:02.746
- And acting from a script.
- Written by a man.

02:02.830 --> 02:03.997
Well said, sister suffragette.

02:04.081 --> 02:06.999
What if she likes making doughnuts
and dinner for her family...

02:07.041 --> 02:09.376
and keeping things nice for them...

02:12.045 --> 02:14.338
Okay, I feel very unpopular right now.

02:14.380 --> 02:16.923
You know, dear,
the first 10 years we were married...

02:17.007 --> 02:19.091
I was upset
when you came home late for dinner.

02:19.175 --> 02:21.176
- Then you're not anymore?
- No.

02:21.260 --> 02:25.554
You are no longer late for dinner.
You're just extremely early for breakfast.

02:26.263 --> 02:28.181
Voila! Your breakfast.

02:29.182 --> 02:31.141
Hey, l'm not saying a word.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:28.558 --> 03:31.309
- Can brains hurt?
- Yes, it's hypochondria hour.

03:31.394 --> 03:34.437
I'm serious. Last night,
when I was reading my biology chapters...

03:34.521 --> 03:37.231
I distinctly heard a ping
in the vicinity of my brain.

03:37.273 --> 03:39.149
- Your brain pinged?
- Yeah.

03:39.233 --> 03:42.902
- It just went dink.
- Then your brain dinked. It didn't ping.

03:42.944 --> 03:45.904
A dinking brain isn't any less worrisome
than a pinging brain.

03:45.988 --> 03:48.531
- You got me there.
- So should I go to a tumor doctor?

03:48.615 --> 03:50.741
You don't have a tumor.
You're reading too much.

03:50.825 --> 03:53.493
- You're probably just losing your eyesight.
- Thank you.

03:53.577 --> 03:54.702
You're welcome.

03:54.786 --> 03:57.954
Hi, can you take
a little constructive criticism?

03:58.038 --> 04:00.706
- No.
- Okay, this place could use a makeover.

04:00.999 --> 04:03.042
It needs sprucing up, like a coat of paint.

04:03.125 --> 04:05.543
- I don't spruce.
- What do you mean you don't spruce?

04:05.585 --> 04:09.421
- What he means is he won't spruce.
- Taylor, do not start.

04:09.505 --> 04:12.006
Me and the rest of
the Town Beautification Committee...

04:12.090 --> 04:14.841
have been hounding him for years
to freshen up the place.

04:14.925 --> 04:18.802
Maybe a couple of nice zinnia pots
out front, some yellow awnings...

04:18.887 --> 04:21.680
a peppy little cardboard pig
announcing the specials.

04:21.764 --> 04:22.889
But he's a mule.

04:22.973 --> 04:26.183
He won't talk, he won't reason,
he won't spruce.

04:26.267 --> 04:29.727
You might as well forget it, Lorelai.
I'm forgetting it, too.

04:29.811 --> 04:32.437
Finally a Taylor Doose position
I can get behind.

04:32.521 --> 04:35.481
Faded paint is a bad reflection
on the whole town.

04:35.565 --> 04:40.026
- Whatever happened to giving up?
- When standards slip, families flee...

04:40.110 --> 04:43.278
and in comes the seedy crowd.
You got trouble, my friends.

04:43.321 --> 04:44.863
Right here in River City.

04:44.947 --> 04:47.740
- This is not funny, Lorelai.
- Does anyone want anything?

04:47.824 --> 04:51.243
Yes, I do. I want to know
why you won't paint this place.

04:51.285 --> 04:55.663
It's a pain. I'd have to close for a day,
which I can't afford, or paint it at night...

04:55.747 --> 04:58.832
which I don't want to do
because I hate painting.

04:58.916 --> 05:00.041
How about this?

05:00.125 --> 05:02.043
- I'll help you. I love to paint.
- You do?

05:02.126 --> 05:03.085
- Yes, I do.
- You love it?

05:03.169 --> 05:05.253
- I want to marry it.
- You have strange passions.

05:05.337 --> 05:08.088
She likes washing dishes, too.
She's multifaceted abnormal.

05:08.131 --> 05:11.133
Come on. We'll drink a couple of beers,
sing painting songs.

05:11.216 --> 05:13.676
- Painting songs?
- Yeah, painting songs.

05:13.760 --> 05:16.095
Like, you know, the song that goes:

05:16.470 --> 05:19.138
Grab your brush and grab your rollers

05:19.180 --> 05:22.265
All you kids and all you bowlers

05:22.307 --> 05:24.767
We're going paintin' today

05:25.310 --> 05:27.311
Say yes, or there's another verse.

05:27.686 --> 05:30.771
I guess maybe if I had help.

05:31.356 --> 05:35.609
- Really? Oh, my God, that's wonderful!
- Taylor, it's not for you. It's for me.

05:35.650 --> 05:39.944
I can't wait to tell the rest
of the committee. They won't believe this.

05:39.987 --> 05:41.279
I hate that he's pleased.

05:41.321 --> 05:44.489
You'll drop a gum wrapper in the street
in front of his store later.

05:44.574 --> 05:45.991
Yeah, good idea.

05:48.993 --> 05:50.452
Kick-ass wine.

05:50.870 --> 05:53.997
- How poetic.
- It's got a nice smell. Earthy, vibrant.

05:54.080 --> 05:57.832
- You can taste the Italian's feet.
- It's a Bordeaux. It's French.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.627
What's an Italian's foot doing
in a French wine?

06:00.669 --> 06:03.170
So when do you guys leave
for Martha's Vineyard?

06:03.254 --> 06:05.422
We're not going
to Martha's Vineyard this year.

06:05.505 --> 06:06.505
Why not?

06:06.590 --> 06:10.217
Our usual rental wasn't available
when we inquired... late.

06:10.467 --> 06:13.385
We should have just
bought a place years ago, like I wanted.

06:13.470 --> 06:14.845
It wouldn't have been prudent.

06:14.887 --> 06:18.472
- Now we have no place to go next week.
- You could always go somewhere else.

06:18.515 --> 06:20.766
We always go to the Vineyard
at this time of year.

06:20.850 --> 06:22.559
You could break the chain, Dad.

06:22.643 --> 06:24.435
- Go to Paris.
- Yes, Paris.

06:24.519 --> 06:26.353
- Impressionism, poodles...
- Creme brulee.

06:26.396 --> 06:27.855
- That's great.
- Impossible.

06:27.897 --> 06:29.481
Pourquoi? French.

06:29.564 --> 06:31.190
We only go to Europe in the fall.

06:31.274 --> 06:33.483
I heard a rumor
Europe's still there in spring.

06:33.526 --> 06:35.986
- I heard it, too.
- We know it's there in the spring.

06:36.027 --> 06:38.612
But we never go then
because we always go in the fall.

06:38.696 --> 06:40.655
It's getting a bit too Lewis Carroll for me.

06:40.698 --> 06:43.366
What is so interesting
about Europe in the spring?

06:43.450 --> 06:44.700
Spring vegetables.

06:44.784 --> 06:46.868
You want us to go to Europe
to eat a vegetable?

06:46.952 --> 06:48.995
No, I don't know. There's all kinds of stuff.

06:49.079 --> 06:51.872
- There's festivals and, you know, Europe.
- In the fall.

06:51.956 --> 06:54.457
It costs a fortune
to travel first-class in Europe.

06:54.541 --> 06:57.042
- We only do it every two years.
- In the fall.

06:57.126 --> 07:01.087
- It's just not in the budget this year.
- You don't have to fly first class.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.339
'Cause there's always coach.

07:05.924 --> 07:10.010
Or business class is slightly less.
There's deals on the Internet.

07:15.848 --> 07:18.183
- Pass the potatoes.
- You got it.

07:19.517 --> 07:22.644
'Catherine the Great, 1729 to'96.

07:22.728 --> 07:26.647
- 'Empress of Russia, 1762 to '96.'
- Hold still, please.

07:26.731 --> 07:30.567
'Originally named Sophie Friederike
Auguste von Anhalt-Zerbst.'

07:30.692 --> 07:32.401
But everybody called her Kitten.

07:32.485 --> 07:36.779
'Married to Grand Duke Peter of Holstein
in 1754.'

07:36.863 --> 07:39.364
- Rory, seriously...
- 'The marriage was an unhappy one.'

07:39.407 --> 07:41.366
There were way too many names.

07:42.617 --> 07:45.368
Lady with notecards,
look at lady with needle and focus...

07:45.411 --> 07:48.162
so I can sew the button on your sweater
and not on my thumb.

07:48.246 --> 07:49.580
I'm sorry.

07:49.998 --> 07:51.248
I'll get it.

07:52.291 --> 07:54.083
You're 4 years old.

07:54.292 --> 07:56.835
- Hiya, baby doll.
- Hi, Babbette.

07:57.211 --> 07:58.336
You want some coffee?

07:58.420 --> 08:01.297
- No, I just came over to ask a big favor.
- Ask away.

08:01.381 --> 08:04.800
Morey just got a call to play a gig
at the Village Vanguard tonight...

08:04.883 --> 08:07.426
- so we gotta go to New York.
- Wow!

08:07.510 --> 08:09.386
- Cream?
- And sugar. Thanks.

08:09.428 --> 08:11.929
Anyway, yesterday
Morey and I finally broke down...

08:12.014 --> 08:14.390
and we got ourselves a new baby.

08:14.432 --> 08:16.641
Honey, you got a kitten. Good for you.

08:16.725 --> 08:21.228
- What's its name?
- Apricot. He's just the cutest thing.

08:21.312 --> 08:24.272
But he's so teeny.
There's no way he can go with us...

08:24.356 --> 08:26.691
and I would hate for him
to stay alone in the house.

08:26.774 --> 08:30.818
So I was thinking maybe Rory could
come over and housesit for the evening.

08:30.902 --> 08:32.277
- I'd love to.
- Great.

08:32.361 --> 08:34.780
We got a kitchen full of food,
and Morey got cable...

08:34.864 --> 08:37.782
so you can watch those four girls
talking dirty if you want to.

08:37.823 --> 08:39.073
- Sounds good.
- You're an angel.

08:39.116 --> 08:41.827
- Both of you, angels. You have a key?
- We got it covered.

08:41.909 --> 08:44.620
Great, l'll leave you the number
of where we're staying.

08:44.662 --> 08:46.663
Have a good time.
We'll be back tomorrow.

08:46.747 --> 08:48.748
- I love you crazy girls.
- Bye!

08:51.834 --> 08:55.169
I can't believe how fast you agreed
to spend the night away from me.

08:55.253 --> 08:57.462
You're crazy. I'm doing her a favor.

08:57.797 --> 08:58.881
Sure you are.

08:58.964 --> 09:02.383
That's okay. Don't you worry about me.
I'll be just fine.

09:02.467 --> 09:05.552
I'd like to debate you on that,
but l'm late for the bus.

09:05.636 --> 09:08.596
This is only the second night
we've ever spent apart.

09:08.680 --> 09:11.640
- Doesn't that make you sad?
- Yeah, but l'll get over it.

09:11.724 --> 09:15.810
Paul and Linda McCartney only spent
11 nights apart their entire relationship.

09:15.893 --> 09:17.936
- Did you know that?
- I did not know that.

09:18.020 --> 09:20.313
They were truly devoted to each other.

09:20.396 --> 09:22.480
Being apart was too painful
to even talk about.

09:22.565 --> 09:23.649
I understand.

09:23.732 --> 09:27.151
I don't think Linda would've even
considered cat-sitting without Paul.

09:27.193 --> 09:30.695
Mom, when I go off to college,
l'm gonna be gone every night.

09:30.779 --> 09:33.739
- What will you do then?
- I will go with you.

09:33.823 --> 09:36.533
I'll sleep on the floor in your dorm,
next to your bed.

09:36.617 --> 09:38.785
- At least you've got a plan.
- Yes.

09:38.827 --> 09:41.829
Perhaps you'd like to take
a picture of me with you tonight.

09:41.870 --> 09:44.496
- In case you get Ionely, you can talk to it.
- Bye.

09:57.257 --> 10:00.425
- Carry your bird, miss?
- Hi, I didn't expect to see you here.

10:00.509 --> 10:02.510
I just wanted to say hello.

10:04.512 --> 10:05.721
Hello.

10:08.681 --> 10:11.307
- So, who's your friend?
- Homework.

10:11.392 --> 10:12.476
Really?

10:12.518 --> 10:16.812
We will be cohabitating for the next month
so I can examine its every move.

10:16.854 --> 10:18.980
- Jealous?
- I'll get over it.

10:20.190 --> 10:23.192
I'm house-sitting tonight for Babbette,
and I was thinking...

10:23.275 --> 10:26.569
maybe if the right offer came along,
I might be up to some company.

10:26.653 --> 10:28.070
- I'm offering.
- I'm accepting.

10:28.154 --> 10:29.905
- Good.
- You wanna get some coffee?

10:29.989 --> 10:31.907
I can't. I have to get to work.

10:31.990 --> 10:35.075
- I thought you go to work at 5:00.
- No, 4:00 on Thursdays.

10:35.159 --> 10:37.410
For some reason,
Thursday's always really busy.

10:37.494 --> 10:41.079
Lots of oppressed housewives
shopping for their husbands' dinner.

10:41.163 --> 10:42.872
- Wow.
- What?

10:43.582 --> 10:45.374
That was a little pointed.

10:45.416 --> 10:48.376
- What are you talking about?
- The crack about the housewives...

10:48.419 --> 10:52.004
- shopping for their husbands' dinner.
- Come on, it was a joke.

10:52.088 --> 10:55.006
It was a pretty weird joke to hear
coming out of your mouth.

10:55.090 --> 10:57.758
You are so sensitive
about the whole Donna Reed thing.

10:57.842 --> 11:00.343
I'm not sensitive about it.
I just find it ridiculous.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.094
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

11:02.179 --> 11:04.555
- So she cooked a lot.
- A lot?

11:05.056 --> 11:07.099
She made homemade doughnuts,
chocolate cake...

11:07.182 --> 11:08.974
a lamb chop-mashed potato dinner...

11:09.058 --> 11:12.185
and enough stew to feed Cambodia
all in one episode.

11:12.269 --> 11:14.979
- So what?
- You really like that concept, don't you?

11:15.063 --> 11:17.689
No, I... Yeah, sort of.

11:17.773 --> 11:19.982
- Oh, my God.
- It's a little over the top...

11:20.066 --> 11:23.193
but the general idea
of a wife cooking dinner for her family...

11:23.235 --> 11:25.695
That's nice. Why is that not nice?

11:25.987 --> 11:27.529
It's not just that.

11:27.572 --> 11:31.908
It's the having to have the dinner on the
table as soon as the husband gets home...

11:31.992 --> 11:34.410
and having to look perfect
to do housework...

11:34.494 --> 11:38.538
and the whole concept that her one point
in life is to serve somebody else.

11:38.580 --> 11:41.081
Yes, but maybe
there are two points of view here.

11:41.123 --> 11:42.123
I don't think so.

11:42.207 --> 11:44.583
You feel that way
because your mother feels that way.

11:44.668 --> 11:48.420
- So I have no opinions of my own?
- I didn't mean that.

11:48.504 --> 11:52.423
If I have no opinions of my own,
then l'd be just the kind of girl you like.

11:53.049 --> 11:56.343
My mom made dinner for my dad
every day before she started working.

11:56.426 --> 12:00.053
Now she even does it on the weekends.
What does that say about her?

12:00.095 --> 12:02.555
It says she has a choice
and Donna Reed didn't.

12:02.597 --> 12:04.598
You do realize
that Donna Reed wasn't real.

12:04.682 --> 12:08.559
I know that, but she represented
millions of women that were real...

12:08.602 --> 12:10.603
and did have to dress and act like that...

12:10.645 --> 12:13.605
Please tell me how we began arguing
about The Donna Reed Show.

12:13.647 --> 12:15.106
I don't know.

12:19.735 --> 12:21.944
Look, I gotta go to work, so...

12:22.904 --> 12:24.947
- Bye.
- Dean?

12:25.072 --> 12:26.948
- What?
- Bird.

12:34.829 --> 12:37.414
- Good, l'm just about to leave.
- Where are you going?

12:37.498 --> 12:40.041
To Luke's.
We're picking out paint colors tonight...

12:40.124 --> 12:42.333
so it's gonna be hours
of 'yes, no, yes, no'...

12:42.418 --> 12:44.419
until my famous perseverance
wears him down...

12:44.503 --> 12:47.046
and he ends up in a ball on the floor
crying like a girl.

12:47.129 --> 12:49.505
- Wanna come watch?
- I'm house-sitting, remember?

12:49.631 --> 12:51.715
Yeah, but you have to eat.
Come have a burger.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.134
No, thanks.

12:54.843 --> 12:57.136
- What is that?
- It's for school.

12:57.429 --> 13:00.806
- He's so cute. What's his name?
- Case Study Number 12.

13:01.015 --> 13:02.307
Is that hyphenated?

13:02.349 --> 13:04.350
Honey, he's adorable.
He should have a name.

13:04.434 --> 13:06.268
I'm not bonding with my midterm,
thank you.

13:06.352 --> 13:10.396
All right, l'll name him.
Hi, your name is Stanley. Hi, Stanley.

13:10.480 --> 13:11.647
It's a girl.

13:11.731 --> 13:14.232
Sorry about the Stanley thing.
Your name is Stella.

13:14.316 --> 13:16.317
Stella's nice,
and she was married to Stanley.

13:16.401 --> 13:17.860
Call it whatever you want.

13:17.943 --> 13:22.112
- You're grumpy. What happened?
- Nothing, just a long day.

13:22.197 --> 13:23.656
You know what the remedy is?

13:23.739 --> 13:27.199
A ringside seat while Luke envisions
strangling me with his baseball cap.

13:27.242 --> 13:30.869
I'll leave the chick here tonight
so the kitten doesn't get any fancy ideas.

13:30.953 --> 13:33.496
She's been fed.
If she gets too loud, put her in my room.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.664
- I'll call you later.
- Okay.

13:38.041 --> 13:41.001
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Just a bad afternoon. I'll fix it.

13:41.085 --> 13:43.128
Call me if you need a wrench
or something.

13:43.212 --> 13:44.379
I will.

13:50.008 --> 13:52.343
Now, this is another way to go.

13:52.552 --> 13:55.512
Sort of a French bistro kind of a look.

13:55.554 --> 13:58.180
- This isn't a French bistro.
- Really?

13:58.556 --> 14:00.474
It's amazing
what you learn when you listen.

14:00.558 --> 14:02.017
Which you usually don't.

14:02.059 --> 14:04.894
Then I don't have useless information
intruding in my brain.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.270
Thank God.

14:06.562 --> 14:10.398
If you wanted to do more warm,
golden Tuscan countryside...

14:10.482 --> 14:13.108
Then l'd go to Italy. Here, l'll wrap this.

14:13.192 --> 14:15.360
We could also go with...

14:15.402 --> 14:18.487
a pastelly English-country-garden theme.

14:18.571 --> 14:20.697
Maybe we could add stenciling
on the ceiling.

14:20.739 --> 14:24.116
- No stenciling.
- Do you even know what stenciling is?

14:24.241 --> 14:26.534
- Does Martha Stewart do it?
- Yes.

14:26.702 --> 14:28.161
No stenciling.

14:30.288 --> 14:31.872
- Ask him.
- I will.

14:31.955 --> 14:33.706
- Go on.
- Don't push.

14:35.166 --> 14:36.667
- Hello.
- What do you want, Kirk?

14:36.751 --> 14:39.211
Taylor tells me
you're thinking of painting this place.

14:39.252 --> 14:41.044
That's right. He is.

14:41.212 --> 14:43.880
Excuse me, l'd like to hear it from him.

14:44.339 --> 14:47.049
- Luke, is that true?
- Yes, Kirk, it is true.

14:47.133 --> 14:48.300
- Really?
- Yes.

14:48.384 --> 14:50.260
- This is your final decision?
- Yes, it is.

14:50.344 --> 14:52.220
- 'Cause it's not too late...
- You heard him.

14:52.262 --> 14:54.555
He's painting this place. Pay up.

14:57.349 --> 14:58.558
Thank you.

14:59.058 --> 15:02.685
- Sorry, man.
- It's a little late for that, don't you think?

15:05.229 --> 15:06.563
I like this.

15:09.774 --> 15:11.316
Okay, I get it.

15:13.611 --> 15:14.736
Hold on.

15:22.700 --> 15:24.993
Meow if you need anything else.

15:47.468 --> 15:49.677
Hi, is Dean in? This is Rory.

15:53.097 --> 15:56.265
Will you tell him I called? Okay, thanks.

16:04.814 --> 16:06.231
- You ready to talk paint?
- No.

16:06.315 --> 16:09.025
Good. I've got all the choices set up...

16:09.109 --> 16:11.694
and while any one of them would work...

16:11.778 --> 16:15.447
I think this combo is currently my favorite.

16:16.239 --> 16:19.783
See? Imagine, this will be for the walls,
this will be for the trim...

16:19.867 --> 16:21.910
the edging around the doors
and the windows.

16:21.993 --> 16:24.202
- I know what the trim is.
- Okay.

16:24.328 --> 16:27.121
The colors are quite similar
to what you have here now...

16:27.164 --> 16:29.415
but they're a little richer, a little warmer.

16:29.499 --> 16:31.959
What do you think? Wait, wait.

16:39.673 --> 16:42.675
- A little ambience?
- This is a diner. We don't do ambience.

16:42.758 --> 16:45.093
One argument at a time.
So what do you think?

16:45.177 --> 16:48.054
Honestly? I have no idea. Do you like it?

16:49.096 --> 16:50.305
- Yeah.
- Okay.

16:50.347 --> 16:51.556
Good.

16:53.016 --> 16:54.642
What are you doing?

16:55.184 --> 16:58.144
The Town Council wanted to do
a before-and-after poster.

16:58.228 --> 17:00.104
- Out.
- Bye.

17:03.357 --> 17:05.316
That's it. We're closed for the night.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.151
Since you have to take everything
off the walls anyway...

17:08.193 --> 17:09.859
now is a good time to decide...

17:09.944 --> 17:12.530
what stuff you'll keep
and what stuff you'll get rid of.

17:12.613 --> 17:14.446
- Everything stays.
- Okay.

17:14.531 --> 17:17.241
There is a plastic dancing pork chop
that says...

17:17.325 --> 17:19.076
Everything stays.

17:19.160 --> 17:22.244
'...I lost my head over a good chop.
You should, too.'

17:22.329 --> 17:24.664
- Everything stays.
- Okay, everything stays.

17:24.747 --> 17:27.332
This place hasn't been painted
since my dad was alive.

17:27.374 --> 17:30.751
- No, I didn't know that.
- He painted it before he opened it...

17:30.835 --> 17:33.795
and once more
when the roof caved in one winter.

17:33.879 --> 17:37.506
- I think that's probably it.
- The paint lasted a long time.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.716
- He got his money's worth.
- Yeah.

17:39.800 --> 17:42.385
He really loved this place, you know?

17:44.845 --> 17:47.722
The store was his life. Mine, too, I guess.

17:48.389 --> 17:51.307
I spent every minute I wasn't in school
in here.

17:51.391 --> 17:54.101
I spent a lot of minutes
I was supposed to be in school.

17:54.185 --> 17:56.811
But why a diner?
Why didn't you keep it a hardware store?

17:56.895 --> 18:00.105
I didn't love the hardware business
the way my dad did...

18:00.189 --> 18:04.316
and I knew how to cook,
so I thought a diner would be more...

18:05.735 --> 18:08.320
- fun.
- That's a hard word for you to say.

18:10.906 --> 18:13.366
I just always wanted to work here.

18:14.241 --> 18:16.992
- Just where Dad did.
- God, that's nice...

18:17.410 --> 18:21.829
to be so, I don't know,
connected to your dad.

18:24.499 --> 18:27.959
- I would have loved that.
- You've got that with Rory.

18:28.460 --> 18:30.169
Yeah, I guess so.

18:30.253 --> 18:32.588
I still think
there's a spot on the wall somewhere...

18:32.671 --> 18:35.464
where my dad took an order one day
when he ran out of paper.

18:35.548 --> 18:38.425
- Really? Where?
- I don't know.

18:39.551 --> 18:41.510
Behind the counter maybe.

18:42.804 --> 18:44.346
Next to the door.

18:46.264 --> 18:47.890
On the right side.

18:49.892 --> 18:51.226
Here it is.

18:52.394 --> 18:54.520
'Three hammers,
Phillips-head screwdriver.'

18:54.604 --> 18:57.272
'Three boxes of nails in assorted sizes.'

18:57.940 --> 19:00.233
I've seen it from time to time.

19:03.193 --> 19:06.070
I guess it is time for a little spruce.

19:06.613 --> 19:08.155
Yeah, it is.

19:09.740 --> 19:12.533
But let's not spruce this particular spot.

19:13.493 --> 19:15.452
- That sounds good.
- Okay.

19:21.290 --> 19:22.957
- Jeez.
- No, don't get up.

19:23.041 --> 19:25.334
- Lf I don't...
- They'll go away, trust me.

19:28.212 --> 19:29.713
They should be in there.

19:29.796 --> 19:33.173
Anyway, just imagine it all in pastels.
The whole thing.

19:42.597 --> 19:45.515
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

19:50.269 --> 19:52.395
- I should go.
- Oh, yeah.

19:57.191 --> 19:59.651
- It's gonna be great.
- I'm sure it is.

20:01.944 --> 20:03.194
- See you.
- See you.

20:12.494 --> 20:14.745
- How's it going?
- Very well.

20:14.829 --> 20:17.956
I have discovered that,
in addition to my lameness in geometry...

20:17.998 --> 20:22.459
I also will not become a biologist,
French translator, or Civil War buff.

20:22.543 --> 20:24.961
I guess that leaves
bass player for the Foo Fighters.

20:25.044 --> 20:26.920
I also wouldn't rule out keyboardist...

20:27.004 --> 20:29.130
in the Siouxsie and the Banshees
reunion tour.

20:29.172 --> 20:30.881
I like that you keep an open mind.

20:30.965 --> 20:32.883
- So, what's up?
- I need to borrow a CD.

20:32.967 --> 20:34.801
- Which one?
- The weird one.

20:34.843 --> 20:36.510
I need more information.

20:36.594 --> 20:39.095
I don't know which one it is,
but if I saw it, l'd know.

20:39.180 --> 20:40.972
Okay, let's have a look.

20:43.516 --> 20:48.311
Okay, we have classic rock,
progressive rock, pretty-boy rock...

20:48.353 --> 20:49.478
Excuse me?

20:49.520 --> 20:52.480
Bon Jovi, Duran Duran,
The Wallflowers, Bush...

20:52.523 --> 20:53.982
Got it. Next?

20:55.525 --> 20:59.319
Punk, new wave, German metal bands...

21:00.070 --> 21:02.488
- Broadway soundtracks.
- Interesting filing system.

21:02.530 --> 21:04.656
- Anything yet?
- Nope, sorry.

21:05.032 --> 21:09.493
Over there, we have jazz, jazz vocals,
classical, country...

21:09.577 --> 21:12.871
rockabilly, Sinatra, The Capitol Years.
Oh, wait.

21:12.954 --> 21:15.997
- The miscellaneous section.
- That sounds right.

21:17.207 --> 21:18.666
William Shatner.

21:18.708 --> 21:20.751
Is this the one
where he sings Tambourine Man?

21:20.835 --> 21:23.044
And Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.

21:23.128 --> 21:25.504
Remind me to get this for my mom
for her birthday.

21:25.546 --> 21:27.672
Oh, wait. That's it.

21:29.049 --> 21:30.299
- Can I?
- Take it.

21:30.383 --> 21:32.592
- Thanks.
- So, what are you doing?

21:32.677 --> 21:36.221
- I'm not completely sure yet.
- Okay, I want details.

21:55.652 --> 21:56.861
Oh, no.

22:00.488 --> 22:02.614
Do something. Show yourself.

22:03.115 --> 22:05.866
Molt, or chirp, or something.

22:06.534 --> 22:09.869
This is so not funny. Not funny.

22:10.662 --> 22:13.705
This is unbelievable.
All day long, just chirps like a maniac...

22:13.790 --> 22:16.792
at the top of her lungs.
And now, nothing. Silence.

22:16.875 --> 22:18.626
Marcel Marceau chicken.

22:20.169 --> 22:23.046
That's okay. I can fix this. We can fix this.

22:23.297 --> 22:26.340
I'm going to make this better.

22:26.424 --> 22:29.259
I'm going to fix...

22:29.426 --> 22:30.885
- Hello?
- Yeah?

22:30.927 --> 22:34.179
Stella got out, and I don't know...
Do I put seed on the floor...

22:34.263 --> 22:36.848
do I make cheeping sounds,
or do I pull a Lucy Ricardo...

22:36.931 --> 22:39.266
and walk like a chicken
so she thinks l'm her mother?

22:39.350 --> 22:41.601
- Who is this?
- What do you mean? It's Lorelai.

22:41.727 --> 22:43.770
Who else would call you
looking for her chick?

22:43.853 --> 22:45.812
You're right. I'm the idiot. Go on.

22:45.896 --> 22:48.856
Could you come over here, please,
and help me?

22:50.817 --> 22:53.860
Yeah, okay. I'll be right over.

22:54.027 --> 22:55.402
Okay, hurry.

23:02.909 --> 23:04.535
Thank God. Get in here.

23:05.952 --> 23:08.245
This place is a disaster. What's going on?

23:08.288 --> 23:12.249
Okay, the last sighting was here,
by the InStyle magazine.

23:12.290 --> 23:15.417
But then she burrowed through
the Glamour, jumped over the Cosmo...

23:15.501 --> 23:17.293
and knocked over a bottle of nail polish.

23:17.377 --> 23:20.254
So if there was any doubt
that this chick was a girl...

23:20.338 --> 23:21.713
there isn't anymore.

23:21.797 --> 23:24.173
- Okay, there she is.
- Jeez, what was that?

23:26.384 --> 23:29.719
- You really do have a chick loose in here.
- Yeah, I told you.

23:29.803 --> 23:31.721
There she goes by the kitchen!

23:31.971 --> 23:34.180
- Don't step on her!
- She cut right in front of me.

23:34.265 --> 23:35.932
She's being graded, so don't squash her.

23:36.016 --> 23:37.558
Tell her to watch where she's going.

23:41.311 --> 23:42.270
Hello?

23:42.354 --> 23:45.231
I wasn't sure if you still wanted me
to come over.

23:45.314 --> 23:49.233
- I do, I absolutely do.
- Are you sure?

23:49.651 --> 23:52.653
Yeah, l'm totally and completely...

23:53.529 --> 23:55.572
- You're teasing me.
- Yeah, a little.

23:55.655 --> 23:58.156
But I did appreciate the enthusiasm.

23:58.324 --> 24:01.951
- So how long until you get here?
- Actually, not long at all.

24:02.035 --> 24:04.536
- Why? Where are you?
- Right outside.

24:13.084 --> 24:16.211
- What the...
- Honey, you're home.

24:21.507 --> 24:23.008
Say something.

24:24.801 --> 24:26.051
Trick or treat?

24:26.553 --> 24:29.721
- What, you don't like it?
- No, I do.

24:31.181 --> 24:33.140
It's got a large circumference.

24:33.224 --> 24:36.142
Thank you. Now come on in.
It's cold outside.

24:44.816 --> 24:46.191
Oh, my God.

24:49.402 --> 24:50.986
Here, let me take your coat.

24:51.571 --> 24:53.655
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

24:57.450 --> 25:00.118
- Interesting music.
- I'm glad you like it.

25:01.369 --> 25:04.746
- So what's that?
- Just some appetizers before dinner.

25:04.997 --> 25:06.498
- Before dinner?
- Yes.

25:06.581 --> 25:08.290
- Are we going out?
- No.

25:08.374 --> 25:10.250
- Ordering pizza?
- Nope.

25:11.168 --> 25:13.211
- So...
- I made you dinner.

25:13.461 --> 25:16.296
- Excuse me?
- Steak, green beans, mashed potatoes...

25:16.339 --> 25:18.799
- You made me dinner?
- That's right.

25:18.924 --> 25:21.259
- You made me dinner?
- And dessert.

25:22.218 --> 25:26.220
- Okay, what is going on here?
- I'm sorry, I thought it was obvious.

25:26.638 --> 25:28.222
It's Donna Reed night.

25:31.475 --> 25:34.060
- I swear she went over there.
- We looked over there.

25:34.143 --> 25:36.394
She went under that chair
and didn't come out.

25:36.478 --> 25:39.146
We moved the chair,
we searched the floor. Nothing.

25:39.188 --> 25:42.690
- Then she went through a hole in the floor.
- There's no hole in the floor.

25:42.774 --> 25:46.109
Maybe there was a hole,
and she crawled through it and fixed it.

25:46.193 --> 25:50.529
Then she's a super-intelligent chick
with great physical and deductive skills.

25:51.447 --> 25:53.740
This is not a chick I wanna find.

25:54.241 --> 25:57.826
- Hey, Luke, what did you mean earlier?
- What are you talking about?

25:57.910 --> 25:59.994
When you got here,
you made some comment...

26:00.037 --> 26:02.955
about me not really having
a chick in the house.

26:03.289 --> 26:06.708
I mean, if I didn't have a chick here,
why did you think I was calling?

26:06.750 --> 26:09.710
No, I thought you were calling
about the chick.

26:10.002 --> 26:13.838
- It didn't seem like it.
- Maybe it didn't seem like it, but it was.

26:13.880 --> 26:15.214
Was what?

26:16.048 --> 26:19.592
Was what I... thought.
Can we just keep looking?

26:19.801 --> 26:20.926
Okay.

26:21.844 --> 26:24.470
- I just still think...
- There she is.

26:24.555 --> 26:26.014
- Where?
- There.

26:28.599 --> 26:29.849
Careful.

26:30.517 --> 26:31.642
Well?

26:33.102 --> 26:36.187
- What can I say?
- You can say it's perfect.

26:36.271 --> 26:38.230
- It's perfect.
- Thank you.

26:38.732 --> 26:40.358
How is it really?

26:40.441 --> 26:42.192
- It's perfect.
- Yeah?

26:42.401 --> 26:45.986
It's amazing. I've never had anyone
make dinner for me before.

26:46.070 --> 26:49.280
Except my mom, and believe me,
it's not the same.

26:49.406 --> 26:51.449
I'm extremely glad to hear that.

26:52.075 --> 26:54.868
Wait. You wanna save room
for dessert, right?

26:55.077 --> 26:58.704
That's right. So, what's for dessert?

26:58.829 --> 27:00.621
Lime Fantasy Supreme.

27:01.164 --> 27:02.539
Which is...

27:12.006 --> 27:15.091
- Green Jell-O and Cool Whip.
- You are insane.

27:17.593 --> 27:20.386
Oh, no. I forgot to make the rolls.

27:20.428 --> 27:22.429
- What?
- I was gonna make rolls.

27:22.472 --> 27:25.432
- That's okay.
- I can't believe I forgot them.

27:27.100 --> 27:29.601
- What are you doing?
- I'll make them now.

27:29.768 --> 27:32.228
Hold on. Come on.

27:33.104 --> 27:35.230
We really don't need rolls.

27:35.481 --> 27:37.732
Donna Reed would have
never forgotten the rolls.

27:37.774 --> 27:40.442
They're gonna make me turn in my pearls.

27:46.614 --> 27:50.450
I promise l'll kick anyone's butt
who comes near those pearls.

27:58.623 --> 28:01.249
As really amazing
as this whole thing was...

28:01.291 --> 28:04.626
I mean, the music, the outfit, the dinner...

28:05.169 --> 28:07.754
I hope you know
that I don't expect you to be Donna Reed.

28:07.838 --> 28:10.756
And I don't want you to be Donna Reed.
That's not what I meant.

28:10.798 --> 28:13.091
This just totally
got blown out of proportion.

28:13.133 --> 28:15.634
I'm actually pretty happy with you.

28:16.302 --> 28:20.221
I know and I appreciate that,
but aside from this actually being fun...

28:20.305 --> 28:22.640
I did a little research on Donna Reed.

28:22.682 --> 28:25.267
- You did research on Donna Reed?
- Look.

28:27.143 --> 28:31.604
She did do the whole milk and cookies,
wholesome, big-skirt thing.

28:31.647 --> 28:32.981
But aside from that...

28:33.023 --> 28:36.817
she was an uncredited producer
and director on her television show...

28:36.900 --> 28:39.443
which made her
one of the first woman TV executives...

28:39.486 --> 28:41.237
which is actually pretty impressive.

28:41.320 --> 28:44.655
I'm glad this turned out to be
such a positive experience for you.

28:44.698 --> 28:45.865
It has been.

28:45.949 --> 28:49.326
And though l'll probably never
get the feeling back in my little toe...

28:49.409 --> 28:51.118
- l'd do it again.
- Yeah?

28:51.161 --> 28:54.580
Someday. But for now,
I better get these dishes cleaned up.

28:55.122 --> 28:56.456
I'll help.

28:56.581 --> 29:00.125
Sorry, you're a man.
You can't help for another 15 years.

29:01.168 --> 29:04.962
Okay, then as the man,
I will do what the man is supposed to do.

29:05.004 --> 29:07.255
- Go bowling?
- Take out the trash.

29:08.298 --> 29:11.300
She's never going anywhere ever again.

29:12.510 --> 29:15.136
I think l'll put Superglue
on the bottom of the cage.

29:15.220 --> 29:17.971
That would be bad, right?
I know staples are bad...

29:18.014 --> 29:21.099
- but what's the verdict on Superglue?
- Ask Stella.

29:21.891 --> 29:23.225
You don't have to do that.

29:23.309 --> 29:26.311
This stuff is sharp.
I wanna get it out of the way.

29:27.103 --> 29:29.396
- Thanks for helping.
- No problem.

29:29.480 --> 29:31.856
I'm gonna throw this stuff outside.

29:50.787 --> 29:52.830
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing?

29:52.872 --> 29:55.373
- You first.
- I'm looking for a chick.

29:55.541 --> 29:57.500
- Yeah, me, too.
- You are not.

29:57.584 --> 29:59.168
Neither are you.

29:59.293 --> 30:00.877
Hey, Luke, is there...

30:05.339 --> 30:06.840
Lorelai, hi.

30:06.882 --> 30:08.841
- Fancy meeting you here.
- Yeah.

30:10.885 --> 30:14.554
The Jell-O's doing
this weird melty thing and I...

30:15.472 --> 30:16.722
Mom, Luke.

30:16.806 --> 30:18.098
- Rory.
- Hi.

30:18.808 --> 30:21.851
- What the hell are you two doing?
- Nothing, she...

30:21.935 --> 30:24.270
We ate dinner. Steak and beans...

30:24.353 --> 30:26.521
Canned, not fresh.

30:26.647 --> 30:28.356
- And potatoes.
- From a box.

30:28.398 --> 30:29.690
But they were still good.

30:29.732 --> 30:31.566
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

30:31.608 --> 30:33.400
What were you guys doing?

30:35.236 --> 30:36.653
I was in the house.

30:36.737 --> 30:40.364
And the lamp sort of...
l'm gonna get going. I'm sorry about the...

30:40.406 --> 30:42.032
- Forget it.
- Okay, bye.

30:42.074 --> 30:44.409
Yeah, l'd probably better go, too.

30:44.910 --> 30:47.370
- Thanks for dinner.
- You're welcome.

30:48.996 --> 30:50.080
What?

30:50.289 --> 30:54.250
Okay, you're 16, you have
a whole house to yourself for the evening.

30:54.292 --> 30:56.752
I expect you're gonna have
your boyfriend over.

30:56.793 --> 30:58.836
But what is with the apron?

30:59.045 --> 31:02.589
- It's a long story.
- Did it involve a sharp blow to the head?

31:02.673 --> 31:04.174
I gotta go check on Apricot.

31:04.257 --> 31:07.842
- Oh, my God. I just saw the pearls.
- I'm going in now.

31:07.926 --> 31:10.469
I'm going inside, too,
because I have to write down...

31:10.553 --> 31:12.679
how l'm gonna torture you
about that outfit.

31:12.763 --> 31:15.306
- Good night.
- Could I get a picture though?

31:15.390 --> 31:19.559
Because visual aids would really help.
The shoes. I'm dying.

31:25.606 --> 31:29.400
- Mom, I can't find Apricot!
- What? No.

31:29.442 --> 31:32.277
She was on the couch when I came out,
and now nowhere.

31:32.361 --> 31:36.030
That's it!
We are not animal people, period.

31:42.034 --> 31:44.077
It was a tiny little favor.

31:44.161 --> 31:47.288
- We have had this discussion before.
- You are being unreasonable.

31:47.372 --> 31:50.540
- I have my standards.
- But this is a simple request.

31:50.624 --> 31:54.376
You are asking me to compromise
my artistic and culinary values.

31:54.460 --> 31:56.753
- Michel wanted an egg-white omelet?
- Yes.

31:56.837 --> 31:59.172
- Crazy man.
- Why am I a crazy man?

31:59.255 --> 32:01.006
I had no time for breakfast today.

32:01.090 --> 32:03.550
So I nicely asked her to make me
an egg-white omelet...

32:03.633 --> 32:07.135
with some tomatoes, mushroom,
a little chives, and she gives me this.

32:07.219 --> 32:08.970
- What is this?
- A three-egg omelet...

32:09.054 --> 32:12.431
with goat cheese, pancetta,
cooked in a sherry olive oil.

32:12.473 --> 32:14.891
I don't eat dairy or meat. You know this.

32:14.933 --> 32:18.393
I am a chef, Michel. It is my job
to make food that tastes good.

32:18.477 --> 32:21.437
- And you do.
- But I can't eat like that and look like her.

32:21.521 --> 32:23.981
- You don't know what you're missing.
- That'll kill you.

32:24.107 --> 32:26.942
- You gotta go someday.
- Someday, this will catch up to you.

32:26.984 --> 32:31.945
You'll become the balloon lady, and with
the luck of God, I will be here to enjoy it.

32:35.782 --> 32:38.408
- You make a good egg-white omelet.
- I know.

32:39.451 --> 32:41.994
- Who wants to hear about my night?
- Oh, me.

32:42.078 --> 32:45.080
It started with Rory's baby chick
getting loose in the house...

32:45.122 --> 32:47.623
and ended with Rory and I up
at 1:00 in the morning...

32:47.665 --> 32:50.833
Iooking for Babbette's new kitten,
who we found asleep in the piano.

32:50.918 --> 32:55.212
- Wow, that's very Wild Kingdom of you.
- I'm the Marlin Perkins of Stars Hollow.

32:55.296 --> 32:56.755
- You want some coffee?
- Please.

32:56.839 --> 32:59.632
- So, how's Rory's chick?
- Better than my lemon lamp.

32:59.674 --> 33:02.175
- What's wrong with your lemon lamp?
- Luke killed it.

33:02.259 --> 33:04.385
- On purpose?
- I can't prove it, but I will.

33:04.469 --> 33:05.678
What was Luke doing there?

33:05.762 --> 33:08.472
I called him when I got home
and Stella wasn't there.

33:08.555 --> 33:10.264
- Stella is the chick?
- Yes.

33:10.307 --> 33:12.558
- I like that name.
- Yeah, Streetcar Named Desire.

33:12.642 --> 33:14.601
- Vivien Leigh or Jessica Tandy?
- Hello! Tandy.

33:14.685 --> 33:15.977
Of course, continue.

33:16.061 --> 33:20.105
So I evaluated the situation in my usual
calm, cool, collected manner...

33:20.147 --> 33:22.356
and then I called Luke
to help me track her down.

33:22.440 --> 33:25.066
- That's when he broke the lamp?
- He's not very graceful.

33:25.151 --> 33:27.777
- He said the weirdest thing.
- 'May I break your lamp?'

33:27.861 --> 33:29.820
He got there and I was looking for Stella...

33:29.863 --> 33:32.823
and he said, 'You really have
a baby chick loose in the house.'

33:32.906 --> 33:35.157
Like I made that up or... I don't know.

33:35.241 --> 33:36.867
- Well.
- Well what?

33:37.410 --> 33:41.204
You call someone and say, 'Can you come
and help me look for my loose chick?'

33:41.287 --> 33:43.121
- It's a little...
- A little what?

33:43.164 --> 33:45.957
It sounds like a code for,
'l'm not wearing any underwear.'

33:45.999 --> 33:49.084
That's not the code for,
'l'm not wearing any underwear.'

33:49.168 --> 33:51.002
Sookie, you're not serious.

33:51.045 --> 33:54.505
- Look, the first time Jackson and I...
- Yeah.

33:55.172 --> 33:58.215
I called him up
and told him I had a bat in my attic.

33:58.300 --> 34:00.760
Honey, you do have a bat in your attic.

34:00.843 --> 34:02.886
So he came over
and we went in the attic...

34:02.970 --> 34:06.347
and we both knew there was no bat,
but we pretended to look for it.

34:06.431 --> 34:08.474
Then when we couldn't find the bat...

34:08.514 --> 34:11.350
we went downstairs
and had a bottle of wine and...

34:11.434 --> 34:14.018
So you're saying Luke thought
I made up a crazy story...

34:14.103 --> 34:17.230
about having some chick
loose in the house just to get him in bed?

34:17.313 --> 34:20.274
Not to get him in bed. Maybe he thought
you wanted to see him...

34:20.357 --> 34:22.315
- and didn't know how to say it.
- That's nuts.

34:22.359 --> 34:26.820
A woman asking a man to come over
late at night to her house. Come on.

34:26.904 --> 34:29.155
Yeah, but this is Luke we're talking about.

34:29.197 --> 34:31.532
- Why did you call him?
- Because I needed help.

34:31.616 --> 34:34.242
- Why didn't you call me?
- I assumed you'd be with Jackson.

34:34.326 --> 34:35.701
- I did.
- Why didn't you call Rory?

34:35.784 --> 34:38.036
She'd have been furious
to know Stella was lost.

34:38.079 --> 34:40.163
Why didn't you call Patty?
She raises chickens.

34:40.205 --> 34:42.456
Or Andrew? He lives around the corner,
doesn't he?

34:42.540 --> 34:45.333
- What is your point?
- My point is that you called Luke.

34:45.376 --> 34:47.710
Out of all the people
you could have called...

34:47.752 --> 34:51.254
that would have come and dropped
what they were doing, you called Luke.

34:51.338 --> 34:55.215
Because I had just been with him.
We were picking out paint samples.

34:55.299 --> 34:57.884
He was on my mind.
It was purely a timing thing.

34:57.968 --> 35:00.136
- Picking out paint samples?
- Yes.

35:00.220 --> 35:02.054
- For Luke's place?
- Yes.

35:02.513 --> 35:05.139
- So you could paint together?
- Once again, yes.

35:05.223 --> 35:06.724
Which, I believe, was your idea.

35:06.808 --> 35:09.685
So now the fact
that I suggested painting Luke's diner...

35:09.726 --> 35:11.602
also means that I wanted
to get him in bed.

35:11.686 --> 35:15.105
Suddenly l'm trying to get any poor,
unsuspecting person in bed with me.

35:15.189 --> 35:16.564
I'm like Michael Douglas.

35:16.606 --> 35:19.941
- Lorelai, this...
- I just... Thanks for the omelet.

35:20.443 --> 35:24.445
No, honey, l'm sorry. Don't be mad at me.

35:24.529 --> 35:27.781
- I'm not mad. I'm tired.
- Okay.

35:28.407 --> 35:31.158
You know, Luke is a really nice man.

35:32.868 --> 35:34.243
Bye, Sookie.

35:44.168 --> 35:46.628
- We thought the doorbell wasn't working.
- Come in.

35:46.712 --> 35:49.630
We were ringing it and ringing it,
and nobody...

35:49.755 --> 35:51.631
I guess we'll just come in.

35:51.715 --> 35:54.592
That'd be the same
as what we were paying for our old place?

35:54.676 --> 35:55.843
Exactly the same.

35:55.927 --> 35:58.470
- Except for the grounds fees.
- The grounds fee is higher.

35:58.553 --> 36:02.055
- But the grounds are larger.
- I'm just trying to get all the information.

36:02.098 --> 36:03.599
All the information...

36:03.641 --> 36:07.602
is that this is our last chance
to go to Martha's Vineyard for the season.

36:08.311 --> 36:11.771
I realize the position we are in,
but this is a business transaction.

36:11.813 --> 36:13.230
For heaven's sake.

36:13.564 --> 36:15.065
As a business transaction...

36:15.107 --> 36:18.192
one in which money goes out
and we receive goods and services...

36:18.276 --> 36:20.736
And he's patronizing me. How lovely.

36:21.153 --> 36:24.864
I must treat this conversation with
the same care and devotion to detail...

36:24.948 --> 36:28.617
I would any conversation that would be
considered a business transaction.

36:28.700 --> 36:30.284
Kindly allow me to do so.

36:30.368 --> 36:33.119
- Richard, Emily, please.
- Goodness, you startled me.

36:33.162 --> 36:37.748
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say l'm sure
we could negotiate the grounds fee.

36:37.832 --> 36:39.082
That'll be fine.

36:39.125 --> 36:41.918
Good. I'll get into this right now
and get back to you.

36:42.002 --> 36:44.086
- Thank you, John.
- Yes, we'll talk to you later.

36:44.170 --> 36:45.254
Bye.

36:46.255 --> 36:47.589
Careful, Richard.

36:47.631 --> 36:50.466
That canary you ate
is going to spoil your dinner.

36:50.508 --> 36:51.592
What's going on?

36:51.634 --> 36:54.052
Your mom and I secured a place
on Martha's Vineyard.

36:54.135 --> 36:56.553
- That's great!
- I thought you lost your old place.

36:56.637 --> 37:00.848
We did, but this afternoon we found out
that Arthur Roundtree had died.

37:00.932 --> 37:02.099
He'd been drinking.

37:02.141 --> 37:04.559
So we got on the phone
and snatched that place up.

37:04.643 --> 37:08.187
- It's a fine piece of property.
- Much better view than our usual place.

37:08.271 --> 37:11.189
Both of you are going to hell.
I hope you know that.

37:11.273 --> 37:13.274
At least we'll be well-rested.

37:13.650 --> 37:14.775
Touche.

37:14.817 --> 37:17.694
- I am so thrilled about this.
- I'm glad.

37:17.778 --> 37:20.821
The two of you must come up
for the weekend. It is so lovely.

37:20.905 --> 37:23.240
- Rory would just love it.
- Can we go for a weekend?

37:23.323 --> 37:25.658
We'll see how much Valium
Aunty Sookie can lend me.

37:25.700 --> 37:29.035
The only drawback is that
we had to rent the place furnished...

37:29.119 --> 37:32.996
and Arthur had dreadful taste.
Remember the library, Richard?

37:34.039 --> 37:36.624
Pink and green. It was just horrible.

37:37.041 --> 37:40.960
- He's dead now, so he got his.
- Lorelai, you're being morbid.

37:41.003 --> 37:42.837
- I'm being morbid?
- New subject, please.

37:42.879 --> 37:45.380
Joan and Melissa Rivers here think
l'm being morbid.

37:45.464 --> 37:49.383
- Rory, what's new in your life?
- Nothing. Just school, homework.

37:49.467 --> 37:51.051
- Aprons.
- Do not go there.

37:51.135 --> 37:53.761
- What does she mean?
- Nothing, I was just teasing her.

37:53.845 --> 37:55.095
- About aprons?
- Yeah.

37:55.180 --> 37:57.139
- I don't understand.
- It's not important.

37:57.181 --> 37:58.390
Then humor me.

37:58.474 --> 38:01.059
Nothing. Rory dressed up in a cute apron
the other day.

38:01.142 --> 38:02.434
I was teasing her about it.

38:02.518 --> 38:04.936
Why did you get dressed up in an apron?

38:06.771 --> 38:09.564
We've decided to give up
on that pesky Harvard dream...

38:09.648 --> 38:11.566
and focus on something more realistic.

38:11.650 --> 38:15.694
Mom, Dad, Rory's decided
to become a maid, just like I was.

38:16.612 --> 38:19.739
Is that funny? Did she think it was funny?

38:20.114 --> 38:22.865
- What made you say such a thing?
- And in front of Rory?

38:22.908 --> 38:26.160
- I was kidding.
- God, my heart stopped.

38:26.577 --> 38:29.662
Why don't you tell them about your bird?
That's a safe subject.

38:29.705 --> 38:31.998
- Your bird?
- Yeah, it's for school.

38:32.040 --> 38:34.833
Each of us has to follow a chick
through its growth process.

38:34.875 --> 38:37.543
Everything must be logged.
Eating and sleeping habits.

38:37.585 --> 38:38.710
Houdini habits.

38:38.794 --> 38:39.961
- She got out.
- She ran far.

38:40.045 --> 38:41.921
- But she lived.
- She's a better bird for it.

38:42.005 --> 38:44.548
- Thank God Luke found her.
- Luke found her?

38:44.632 --> 38:46.967
- What?
- Rory said Luke found her.

38:47.134 --> 38:48.760
Getting me back for the apron thing?

38:48.843 --> 38:53.096
- Did the bird get loose in Luke's diner?
- No, the bird got loose at home.

38:53.180 --> 38:54.889
- Your home?
- Yes.

38:56.057 --> 39:00.310
- So, Grandpa, when's your next trip?
- Madrid, the twelfth.

39:00.393 --> 39:02.936
There's a nice edition of Cervantes
in it for you.

39:03.020 --> 39:04.020
Gracias.

39:04.063 --> 39:08.524
- What was Luke doing at your house?
- Look, there's no ice. I'll get some.

39:09.066 --> 39:12.735
- I asked you a question.
- He was helping me find the bird, Mom.

39:12.819 --> 39:14.153
- Really?
- Yes, really.

39:14.237 --> 39:16.196
And how did he know
the bird was missing?

39:16.280 --> 39:19.865
Was he strolling by your house
and he heard your plaintive cries for help?

39:19.908 --> 39:22.243
Or the helpless cheep
of a chick in trouble?

39:22.326 --> 39:23.910
I called him, Mom, okay?

39:23.994 --> 39:27.454
I called him and asked him to come over
and help me find the bird, okay?

39:27.538 --> 39:29.789
This man is always around
when you're in trouble.

39:29.873 --> 39:31.499
- He's a good friend.
- Please.

39:31.583 --> 39:35.043
- Do we have to discuss this?
- I'm getting a little tired of being lied to.

39:35.127 --> 39:36.336
Apparently we do.

39:36.420 --> 39:40.297
This man was at Rory's birthday party.
He came to the hospital with you.

39:40.381 --> 39:44.842
He's the male lead in every story you tell.
You go to the diner every single day.

39:44.926 --> 39:48.303
I've seen how he looks at you,
the way you look at him. I'm not a fool.

39:48.387 --> 39:49.512
Mom, please.

39:49.596 --> 39:53.557
Why do you treat me like I don't have
a clue as to what is going on in your life?

39:53.640 --> 39:55.558
Now l'm asking you, as a favor...

39:55.600 --> 39:59.519
if you have any respect for me at all
as your mother, just tell me.

39:59.603 --> 40:01.729
Do you have feelings for this man?

40:05.441 --> 40:06.900
I don't know.

40:07.275 --> 40:10.360
Maybe I do.
I haven't given it that much thought.

40:12.195 --> 40:13.570
Maybe I do.

40:14.197 --> 40:17.491
Thank you.
I'm glad you were finally honest with me.

40:17.699 --> 40:21.243
Now we can discuss what on earth
you could possibly be thinking.

40:21.327 --> 40:23.119
Don't forget the ice.

40:39.298 --> 40:41.591
So you're sure we need this many cans?

40:41.633 --> 40:46.136
Yeah, you need enough for two coats,
touchups and little spots.

40:46.220 --> 40:47.929
No, l'm not sure.

40:48.638 --> 40:50.722
We got the paint, the brushes...

40:50.807 --> 40:54.142
the tarps, and all the other stuff
the paint guy said we'd need.

40:54.226 --> 40:56.602
- So I guess we're ready.
- Yes, we are.

40:56.644 --> 40:58.979
The only thing left to do
is figure out when.

40:59.021 --> 41:00.313
- How about Friday?
- Friday?

41:00.397 --> 41:03.440
You don't want this lying around.
I don't know if paint goes bad.

41:03.483 --> 41:06.777
But judging by the smell when it's fresh,
rotten paint would be gross.

41:06.818 --> 41:08.402
Don't you meet your folks on Friday?

41:08.486 --> 41:11.529
Yeah, but I can get out early
for a special occasion.

41:11.613 --> 41:13.364
- Friday it is.
- Good.

41:17.159 --> 41:19.077
- Hey.
- Hey, you.

41:19.161 --> 41:22.413
- Jeez, you think you got enough paint?
- I know, I tried to tell him.

41:22.496 --> 41:25.164
- So dinner. Thoughts?
- Let's have some.

41:25.207 --> 41:26.666
- How about Chinese?
- Sounds good.

41:26.708 --> 41:28.667
I need to stop at the market and get fruit.

41:28.751 --> 41:30.710
- Why?
- I think l'm getting scurvy.

41:30.794 --> 41:31.878
- Really?
- Yeah.

41:31.962 --> 41:35.172
That or a cold.
But, either way, I need some fruit.

41:38.550 --> 41:41.677
- Damn motorcycles. They're a scourge.
- Yeah.

41:41.802 --> 41:45.262
They're loud. They're dangerous.
We should ban them from town.

41:45.346 --> 41:46.972
Maybe we should set up barricades...

41:47.014 --> 41:50.308
and ban all unwelcome strangers
from crossing the border.

41:50.350 --> 41:52.768
No, we couldn't do that.
That would be illegal.

41:52.852 --> 41:55.812
- Darn laws.
- Gotta get away from that noise.

41:58.314 --> 42:01.899
- Kill me and bury me with that bike.
- What is it, a Harley?

42:01.983 --> 42:04.693
That is a 2000 Indian 80 horsepower...

42:04.777 --> 42:07.945
five-speed, close-ratio
Andrews transmission. I wanna get one.

42:08.029 --> 42:09.071
- No.
- Why not?

42:09.155 --> 42:10.697
- You'd die.
- Oh, that.

42:18.912 --> 42:21.997
- Hi.
- Nice shirt. Take it off.

42:28.127 --> 42:29.211
Dad!

42:32.464 --> 42:35.716
- This is great! What are you doing here?
- I'm here to see you.

42:35.799 --> 42:39.551
And your mom, who's not saying anything
about as loud as a person can.

42:39.594 --> 42:41.386
- Hello.
- A word.

42:41.554 --> 42:43.972
Perhaps there's a phrase in my future.

42:44.055 --> 42:46.181
Okay, why is that man staring at me?

42:46.265 --> 42:49.809
That's Taylor Doose. He owns the market.
He knows all and sees all.

42:49.893 --> 42:53.437
So, what's with the just showing up,
Mr. Spontaneity Guy?

42:53.521 --> 42:56.022
My folks are in Connecticut,
so l'm here to see them.

42:56.064 --> 42:59.191
On the way I thought l'd stop by
and surprise the Gilmore girls.

42:59.233 --> 43:00.400
Are you surprised?

43:00.484 --> 43:02.735
The teeniest feather
could knock me in the gutter.

43:02.777 --> 43:05.153
Where would somebody find
a place to stay here?

43:05.237 --> 43:07.196
- You're staying?
- I'm thinking about it.

43:07.239 --> 43:08.990
- Stay with us.
- Sweetie.

43:09.073 --> 43:10.282
I don't think your mom wants...

43:10.366 --> 43:12.992
No, it's not that.
It's just that l'm still surprised.

43:13.076 --> 43:14.410
Mom, please?

43:15.953 --> 43:17.787
Why not stay with us for a couple of days?

43:17.872 --> 43:19.498
Thanks. You won't even know l'm there.

43:19.581 --> 43:21.499
- Hey, hop on.
- Hop off.

43:22.500 --> 43:24.042
- Hop on.
- Hop off.

43:28.880 --> 43:30.005
Hop on.
