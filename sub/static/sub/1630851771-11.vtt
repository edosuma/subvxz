WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:03.168
Previously, on "below deck"...

00:03.204 --> 00:05.504
I'm really sorry.
I have to go.

00:06.540 --> 00:08.073
We are so screwed right now.

00:08.092 --> 00:10.426
Interior, third stew.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.763
Fortunately, someone
kinda comes to mind.

00:14.799 --> 00:16.348
I'm open to anything that helps.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.720
She's my fiancé, but she's
not my girlfriend.

00:24.725 --> 00:25.724
[shouting]

00:27.261 --> 00:29.311
this rayna-jake thing
is gonna be, like,

00:29.363 --> 00:31.530
a ----ing roller coaster.

00:33.600 --> 00:34.566
Eh, this could get messy.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.102
Mwah!

00:37.121 --> 00:38.537
There's salt all
over everything.

00:38.572 --> 00:40.272
Now you guys have to
get up early in the morning

00:40.291 --> 00:41.273
and get it done.

00:41.292 --> 00:42.324
Is there something wrong?

00:42.376 --> 00:43.608
No, I haven't said anything.

00:43.627 --> 00:45.160
No, you don't have
to say anything

00:45.212 --> 00:46.495
if your eyes roll off
the back of your head.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.497
I told you, this has nothing
to do with you.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.582
Are they having a
threesome in rayna's room?

00:52.136 --> 00:54.086
Oh, how's your threesome going?

00:55.673 --> 00:56.672
Excuse me?

00:59.009 --> 01:02.161
I might have a little crush,
but he's straight and I'm gay,

01:02.196 --> 01:03.328
so I'm not stupid.

01:25.619 --> 01:27.119
[snoring]

01:30.458 --> 01:32.458
-really?
-I'd put money on it.

01:50.945 --> 01:53.579
Things got pretty heated,
pretty close.

01:57.618 --> 02:00.202
I'm so red right now.

02:00.254 --> 02:01.420
I'm so embarrassed.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.125
What's happening?

02:07.327 --> 02:08.427
No!

02:08.462 --> 02:10.212
Why are you acting guilty?

02:12.216 --> 02:13.248
Really?

02:13.300 --> 02:14.249
So, I left the room.

02:14.301 --> 02:15.700
Jake.

02:15.719 --> 02:17.586
I know, I just
started thinking about paris,

02:17.638 --> 02:19.605
and then I was just...
Couldn't do it.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.590
Must be in love, hey?

02:21.642 --> 02:22.758
Yeah, you must be.

02:26.480 --> 02:31.266
And I think it's a great,
great move that he didn't.

02:31.318 --> 02:32.818
Let's go to bed.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.520
Not to mention I'd probably
be a bit jealous.

02:34.555 --> 02:37.656
That's just the naughty
side of me coming out.

02:37.675 --> 02:39.708
-All right, night, dude.
-Good night, mate.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.370
Oh, god.

02:59.547 --> 03:00.879
Do I need a haircut?

03:00.915 --> 03:01.880
Yes.

03:01.915 --> 03:03.882
Do I need a boyfriend?

03:03.917 --> 03:04.883
No.

03:04.918 --> 03:05.917
Do I want one?

03:05.936 --> 03:06.935
[belches]

03:06.971 --> 03:08.720
not really.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.856
I refuse to sleep until
these crow's feet are hidden.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.941
About to preparation h
that sh--.

03:12.977 --> 03:15.644
-Good morning.
-Good morning, guys.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.496
We have to finish washing, eh?

03:17.531 --> 03:20.649
Yeah, bridge deck,
main deck.

03:20.701 --> 03:23.368
Both sides, swim platform,
tender, hull.

03:23.404 --> 03:24.536
Cool.

03:26.490 --> 03:27.823
I swear to god, no.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.442
I hate jake, usually.

03:30.461 --> 03:33.212
So, nothing happened,
so it doesn't matter.

03:44.475 --> 03:47.792
Oh, boy, that hurt,
that getting up, [bleep].

03:47.811 --> 03:51.296
Just get hoses and then
buckets of water vinegar.

03:51.315 --> 03:52.981
Pickup day tomorrow.
Get it done.

03:53.017 --> 03:55.317
This is all uniforms to
be ironed.

03:55.352 --> 03:56.485
Okay.

03:56.520 --> 03:57.686
All this is personal
bullsh--.

03:57.738 --> 03:58.870
Dude, I hate these
----ing hoses.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.639
Like, I can piss
harder than this.

04:00.674 --> 04:01.640
Eww.

04:01.659 --> 04:03.408
Eddie, heather, rachel,

04:03.444 --> 04:06.278
I need you guys in
the crew mess, please.

04:06.313 --> 04:07.446
Copy.

04:07.481 --> 04:08.830
Ba, ba, ba.

04:08.866 --> 04:10.832
Sorry, I just need my
highlighter.

04:10.868 --> 04:12.451
Okay.

04:12.486 --> 04:14.753
Tony thornton,
that's our primary.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.488
Retired naval officer, whoa.

04:16.507 --> 04:17.656
Thirty years of service.

04:17.675 --> 04:19.591
He now runs his
own tech company.

04:19.627 --> 04:22.861
Tony's wife, porscha,
stays at home with the kids.

04:22.896 --> 04:25.364
Also joining will be a
group with tony and porscha's

04:25.399 --> 04:27.399
long-time friends and
military colleagues.

04:27.434 --> 04:28.383
Really excited for this charter.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.851
They're navy guys.

04:29.887 --> 04:31.186
I've got a lot of
history with the navy.

04:31.221 --> 04:33.338
My grandfather,
admiral john d. Kelsey.

04:33.357 --> 04:35.440
I thought about joining
the navy after college,

04:35.476 --> 04:37.776
but instead,
I joined yachting.

04:37.811 --> 04:39.728
Should have joined
the ----ing navy.

04:39.780 --> 04:40.812
Night one...

04:43.417 --> 04:45.033
I like this.

04:45.069 --> 04:46.785
This is how I like it, and all
the things that I want in it.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.787
Day two, beach picnic.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.855
Dinner on night two,

04:50.874 --> 04:52.824
black-tie dinner
celebrating love, marriage,

04:52.859 --> 04:54.526
and black excellence.

04:54.545 --> 04:57.862
Claudia is allergic to
shellfish, highly allergic.

04:57.881 --> 05:01.767
And pete is allergic to dairy.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.552
Yeah, and we do have
a new stew

05:03.587 --> 05:06.922
that'll be joining us
this trip sometime during.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.974
It's that friend
of yours, kaylee.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.475
Very excited.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.894
Make things easier
on all of us. Okay?

05:12.930 --> 05:14.479
All right, that's it, kids.

05:14.515 --> 05:15.764
You don't need
to run away so fast.

05:15.816 --> 05:16.982
Oh, yes, I do.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.600
I'm very excited about kaylee.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.051
Oh, really?

05:20.070 --> 05:21.236
She's my second stew on
my boat in florida.

05:21.271 --> 05:22.587
-Is this gonna create...
-Yeah.

05:22.623 --> 05:23.889
...Issues between you
and fraser?

05:23.924 --> 05:25.524
-I hope not.
-Well, keep on eye on it,

05:25.559 --> 05:26.692
make sure he doesn't
get down on himself.

05:28.746 --> 05:31.413
-Ugh!
-Ugh.

05:31.448 --> 05:32.781
What?

05:32.833 --> 05:33.999
Nothing, I just
remembered something.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.120
-Don't talk to me.
-What?

05:38.172 --> 05:39.838
Don't...

05:39.873 --> 05:41.673
I've been having flashbacks
all day, like, ugh.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.477
There's nothing to talk about.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.629
Get away from me, jake.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.548
-Walk away from me.
-Wait, wait, no, are we cool?

05:49.583 --> 05:51.016
Are we cool?
Obviously.

05:51.051 --> 05:52.684
It's good that nothing
happened, though, right?

05:52.720 --> 05:54.553
-I agree, I agree.
-Yeah?

05:54.588 --> 05:55.587
Because I would have hated
you probably more.

05:55.606 --> 05:56.788
Yeah.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.023
We were ----ing close.

05:58.058 --> 05:59.691
No, it wasn't.

05:59.727 --> 06:00.792
-It's...
-Shut up!

06:00.828 --> 06:01.943
No, it wasn't.

06:01.979 --> 06:04.062
♪ I wanna get dirty ♪

06:09.653 --> 06:12.137
so, on the first day
I'm gonna be doing

06:12.172 --> 06:14.456
kind of a mediterranean theme.

06:14.491 --> 06:18.710
I would love to get my hands on
some greek columns, if possible.

06:20.614 --> 06:21.580
Awesome, thank you so much.

06:21.615 --> 06:22.581
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm, bye.

06:22.616 --> 06:23.665
All right.

06:25.686 --> 06:27.085
-It's nice to have music.
-I'm jamming out a little bit.

06:29.356 --> 06:31.556
I'm just putting stuff back
in the laz at the moment,

06:31.592 --> 06:33.008
and then I'm gonna tidy up
in the workshop.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.146
Let's do this.

06:41.969 --> 06:43.968
Fraser, I'll let you choose...

06:43.987 --> 06:46.138
Knock-off's at 6:00, so
if you'd rather finish tonight

06:46.173 --> 06:48.573
so you have less tomorrow,
that's a personal choice.

06:50.694 --> 06:52.861
That can go into
a trash bag, and done.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.780
-Let's get four beers.
-Yeah.

06:54.815 --> 06:57.032
I'm in a bad mood.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.170
Hey, babe, how you doing?
How's my plants?

07:05.292 --> 07:06.958
Good luck at work tomorrow.
I miss you.

07:06.994 --> 07:08.260
Bye.

07:08.295 --> 07:09.828
I'm happy!

07:09.847 --> 07:12.547
Ooh-hoo-hoo, that's some
kind of spicy to me.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.366
What's wrong?

07:14.401 --> 07:17.602
I'm really not feeling very
excited about this charter.

07:17.654 --> 07:19.387
I don't know why, I'm just
feelout that our second stewtedd

07:19.406 --> 07:20.605
will be joining us.

07:20.657 --> 07:21.773
When?

07:21.825 --> 07:23.241
In the middle of
this next charter.

07:23.277 --> 07:25.076
Do you know anything
about her?

07:25.112 --> 07:29.448
Yeah, actually, we're getting my
stew from my boat in florida.

07:29.500 --> 07:31.533
-You know her already?
-Yeah.

07:31.568 --> 07:33.418
That's odd.
Did you request her?

07:33.454 --> 07:34.669
That's, like, a big deal.

07:34.705 --> 07:36.505
No, I just gave her cv
to captain lee.

07:36.540 --> 07:37.539
How long have you
worked together for?

07:37.574 --> 07:39.758
Eight months.

07:39.793 --> 07:40.876
Which should be exciting.

07:42.746 --> 07:44.429
I feel threatened.

07:44.465 --> 07:46.798
I don't like someone coming
in who knows heather

07:46.850 --> 07:49.634
to sort of impede on
what we've just built.

07:49.686 --> 07:51.970
It makes me worry,
and I feel insecure.

07:52.022 --> 07:53.605
-Is she good fun?
-Jake!

07:55.976 --> 07:58.226
All right, I'm gonna
go do some ironing.

08:03.901 --> 08:06.785
Mm, I don't know how I feel
about this whole situation.

08:08.489 --> 08:09.788
Mm-hmm.

08:09.823 --> 08:10.789
I don't think that
was the best idea.

08:10.824 --> 08:11.823
It's not.

08:16.046 --> 08:18.313
Well, what do you want,
you want no help at all?

08:18.348 --> 08:20.415
-No, not at all.
-You look very defensive.

08:22.486 --> 08:23.618
Don't start off on that foot.

08:23.637 --> 08:25.554
It was her or nobody else.

08:25.589 --> 08:27.472
-I just don't know why...
-It's help or it's no help.

08:28.809 --> 08:30.342
Coming up...

08:30.394 --> 08:31.760
We're gonna renew
their vows for them,

08:31.795 --> 08:34.262
and we would love for
you to be the officiate.

08:34.297 --> 08:35.897
He's like, "this is
the best idea ever."

08:35.933 --> 08:37.732
-you suggested this?
-All the... Yes, I did.

08:37.768 --> 08:41.302
That's a huge ----ing no-no.

08:41.321 --> 08:43.522
I'm not happy.

08:49.512 --> 08:51.513
I don't know if
that's the best idea.

08:51.548 --> 08:53.398
It's help or it's no help.

08:53.450 --> 08:55.217
-I just don't know why... Yeah.
-That's ----ing bullsh--.

08:55.252 --> 08:57.736
I am furious.

08:57.788 --> 08:59.621
We've all been
carrying the weight

08:59.656 --> 09:01.456
and we need
an extra set of hands.

09:01.491 --> 09:04.075
I, like, walk down the stairs
just to hear fraser be like,

09:04.127 --> 09:06.294
"this is a terrible idea,
for her to bring her in here."

09:06.330 --> 09:09.064
I kind of expected fraser
to take this as a good thing.

09:09.099 --> 09:10.665
I'm just, like, fed up.

09:13.420 --> 09:14.419
I know.

09:24.147 --> 09:25.847
I've come a long way from being

09:25.882 --> 09:29.484
an insecure, dorky child,
dressed by my mother.

09:29.519 --> 09:32.604
But I think that
I still have a voice in my head

09:32.656 --> 09:35.190
telling me that
I'm not good enough.

09:37.861 --> 09:41.112
I need to shake it off, but
right now, I feel like sh--.

09:41.164 --> 09:42.631
Let me get some work done.

09:44.901 --> 09:46.451
[phone beeps]

09:49.606 --> 09:51.373
eight.

09:51.408 --> 09:52.374
Eight.

09:52.409 --> 09:53.375
[laughing]

09:53.410 --> 09:54.575
good?

09:54.595 --> 09:55.743
I'm going to go to bed.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.412
Hello?

09:57.431 --> 09:58.680
Hey, darling, how's it going?

10:00.450 --> 10:01.850
Just causing chaos.

10:01.885 --> 10:04.185
Yesterday we had the day off
and we were all...

10:04.221 --> 10:05.804
Yeah?

10:05.856 --> 10:07.689
...So plastered, three-way
kisses, we were getting naked.

10:09.726 --> 10:11.559
Yeah, yeah, we almost
had sex last night.

10:15.432 --> 10:17.065
What?

10:23.323 --> 10:24.739
I think it would really
hurt her feelings,

10:24.774 --> 10:26.274
and I don't
think it's worth blowing

10:26.293 --> 10:27.792
what we have for one night.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.077
You look beautiful.

10:30.464 --> 10:31.579
I am your biggest fan.

10:33.216 --> 10:34.332
All right, bye.

10:35.352 --> 10:36.518
I really need to eat something.

10:42.592 --> 10:43.725
[alarm sounds]

10:46.263 --> 10:48.196
your hair looks so good.

10:48.231 --> 10:51.282
It's the luxurious salt water,
gets my curls all curly.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.834
It looks so beautiful.

10:52.869 --> 10:55.270
Okay, everyone needs to get
their sh-- out of here.

10:55.305 --> 10:57.605
Rise-and-shine.

10:57.624 --> 10:59.207
<i> Eddie, eddie, lee.</i>
<i> You got a second for me?</i>

10:59.242 --> 11:00.608
<i> Copy that.</i>

11:00.627 --> 11:02.327
What needs to be done
this morning?

11:02.379 --> 11:03.712
Just wipe down, because we've
done everything already.

11:03.747 --> 11:05.280
Morning, cap.

11:05.315 --> 11:06.247
I'm just gonna put
your trousers here.

11:06.283 --> 11:07.716
Thank you.

11:07.751 --> 11:08.750
Morning, cap,
how's the wind treating us?

11:08.785 --> 11:09.851
-What wind?
-What wind.

11:09.886 --> 11:11.653
It's like glass out there.

11:11.688 --> 11:13.488
Ah, I think I'll have you take
it off the dock today,

11:13.507 --> 11:14.923
if you're up for it.

11:14.958 --> 11:16.675
I'm up for it,
yeah, definitely up for it.

11:16.710 --> 11:17.676
-Nervous?
-Yeah.

11:17.711 --> 11:19.427
You should be.

11:19.463 --> 11:21.262
So, any tricks about
coming outta here?

11:21.298 --> 11:22.364
You wanna split the middle,
but remember,

11:22.399 --> 11:24.499
-it pulls to the left.
-Mm-hmm.

11:24.518 --> 11:26.468
Undocking is always stressful.

11:26.503 --> 11:27.802
The marina's tight.

11:27.837 --> 11:30.171
There's not a lot
of room for error.

11:30.190 --> 11:33.808
At no time do you take
your eyes off the markers.

11:33.843 --> 11:35.510
If somebody's on fire,

11:35.529 --> 11:37.645
I'll stomp on 'em
and put it out.

11:37.680 --> 11:39.614
I mean, coming out
the concrete piers,

11:39.649 --> 11:43.718
you run right into an area
of very shallow water, so yeah,

11:43.754 --> 11:45.186
I mean, there's a
lot that can go wrong,

11:45.205 --> 11:47.288
and catastrophically wrong.

11:47.324 --> 11:48.957
Your job is to not [bleep] up.

11:48.992 --> 11:50.458
I'll do my best.

11:50.494 --> 11:52.210
Jake, jake, eddie.

11:52.245 --> 11:53.294
Can you come to the
wheelhouse, please?

11:53.330 --> 11:54.496
Yeah, copy.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.333
Yeah.

11:58.368 --> 12:00.218
-Hey, bud.
-Hey.

12:00.253 --> 12:01.503
You'll be on the main deck aft
as we're getting underway.

12:01.538 --> 12:02.504
Yeah.

12:02.539 --> 12:04.005
Once we get up to the anchorage,

12:04.040 --> 12:05.507
while we're dropping anchor,
wes and rayna

12:05.542 --> 12:06.725
can be putting out the
nautibuoys.

12:06.760 --> 12:07.842
-Okay.
-Yeah.

12:07.877 --> 12:09.511
-Cool.
-Cool.

12:09.546 --> 12:11.379
I have a lot of experience
operating large vessels.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.948
You know, I drive a
5,000-horsepower tractor tug.

12:13.984 --> 12:16.735
But captain lee's never
looking over my shoulder

12:16.770 --> 12:18.820
while I'm doing it,
so this is a little different.

12:18.855 --> 12:20.655
A little bit of extra
nerves there in the back.

12:20.690 --> 12:21.990
So, I'll catch you later.

12:22.025 --> 12:23.358
-All right, buddy, thanks.
-Thank you.

12:23.393 --> 12:24.692
Little adventure...

12:24.727 --> 12:26.578
Are you ready for
an adventure, donkey?

12:26.613 --> 12:29.614
<i> All crew, all crew, we have</i>
<i> provisions on the dock.</i>

12:29.666 --> 12:30.698
<i> Copy that, thanks, jake.</i>

12:30.733 --> 12:32.700
Oh, we got that fancy tequila.

12:32.736 --> 12:33.752
Rosé moet.

12:33.787 --> 12:35.754
Load me up, uh, huh, huh.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.372
Oh, jesus christ.

12:37.407 --> 12:39.758
That goes to skylounge.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.926
Yah. Boom!
Okay, that's heavy.

12:41.962 --> 12:44.796
Do you wanna vacuum the stairs
and wipe down this table?

12:44.848 --> 12:47.915
Cabins all need to be vacuumed,
and I just turned laundry over.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.350
Focus on the cabins.

12:49.386 --> 12:50.585
I thought those
were done already.

12:50.620 --> 12:52.420
I thought cabins
would be done, too.

12:52.439 --> 12:53.855
Very annoying.

12:58.328 --> 12:59.661
Oh.

12:59.696 --> 13:01.229
For the guests for lunch today.

13:01.264 --> 13:03.531
Are you plating or
family-styling for lunch?

13:03.567 --> 13:04.866
Okayso, I'm gonna grab
all thwhite on

13:04.885 --> 13:06.401
thank you.

13:06.436 --> 13:08.203
-You ready to go?
-Are you ready to go?

13:08.238 --> 13:09.637
-Yeah, I'm ready.
-Let's do it.

13:09.673 --> 13:10.672
All right, let's go ahead,
drop lines.

13:10.707 --> 13:11.923
Copy.

13:11.975 --> 13:14.008
[grunts]

13:14.044 --> 13:15.343
-pretty subtle.
-Yeah.

13:15.378 --> 13:16.895
You really have
to pay attention.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.513
Perfect.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.482
Where's your right
hand supposed to be?

13:20.517 --> 13:21.883
-Here?
-On your clutch.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.351
On my clutch?

13:26.022 --> 13:27.655
What's the bow doing?

13:27.691 --> 13:28.690
What's my bow doing?

13:28.725 --> 13:29.858
Bow is 10 feet off.

13:31.528 --> 13:32.760
You got control of your rudder.

13:32.796 --> 13:33.862
Yeah.

13:33.897 --> 13:36.498
Put it in forward.

13:36.533 --> 13:38.500
Already, you're pulling
to the port.

13:38.535 --> 13:39.534
Midships...

13:40.871 --> 13:43.371
What's your rpms?

13:43.406 --> 13:44.372
You're coming off to port.

13:44.407 --> 13:45.423
Yep.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.742
Port bow 25 feet
from the marker.

13:47.777 --> 13:49.477
I'll give you a hand.

13:49.513 --> 13:52.046
Okay, the stern is clear,
fenders in.

13:52.082 --> 13:54.516
Get it up to 1,600 and let's
get the [bleep] outta here.

13:54.551 --> 13:55.934
Copy that, thank you.
Nice job, guys.

13:55.969 --> 13:57.635
I feel great.
I'm proud of myself.

13:57.687 --> 13:59.304
It's all downhill
from here, right?

13:59.356 --> 14:01.456
It's gonna be good.

14:01.491 --> 14:03.358
How was it?

14:03.393 --> 14:04.859
Next time you take it off the
dock, I'll just stay in bed.

14:06.730 --> 14:09.364
Whew.

14:09.399 --> 14:12.066
♪ I like sweating
in the caribbean ♪

14:12.102 --> 14:14.269
♪ it's one of
my favorite pastimes ♪

14:16.573 --> 14:17.906
your canapé is set up
on the bar out there.

14:17.941 --> 14:19.474
Okay.

14:19.509 --> 14:20.475
<i> Jake, go ahead and</i>
<i> ready the anchor.</i>

14:20.510 --> 14:21.492
<i> Copy that.</i>

14:21.545 --> 14:22.493
Both mains in reverse.

14:22.546 --> 14:23.962
In reverse.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.580
When you start backing up,
that's your drop.

14:25.615 --> 14:26.581
Go ahead and drop.

14:29.803 --> 14:31.553
Oh, lordy, lord.

14:32.589 --> 14:33.638
All right, lock it off.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.423
-Well done.
-Thank you, cap.

14:35.458 --> 14:39.727
Ugh, this is when you ask
yourself why you do this job.

14:39.763 --> 14:41.529
I'm still feeling a
little bit on edge,

14:41.565 --> 14:43.932
knowing that someone might
come in and be better than me.

14:46.503 --> 14:49.487
I don't want inside jokes
and buddy-buddy pal sh--.

14:49.522 --> 14:51.940
That's gonna make me
feel like a third wheel.

14:51.975 --> 14:54.108
Insecurities can't
be brushed under...

14:54.143 --> 14:56.477
What is it, brushed under the
couch, sofa, what do people say?

14:56.496 --> 14:57.812
Brushed under the rug.

14:57.847 --> 14:58.947
I don't like that saying.

14:58.982 --> 15:00.281
That is beautiful.

15:01.334 --> 15:02.717
Go, me.

15:02.752 --> 15:04.419
Deck crew, deck crew,
if you guys wanna get

15:04.454 --> 15:05.753
the nautibuoys ready,
and whoever wants to get wet,

15:05.789 --> 15:06.754
get ready for that too.

15:06.790 --> 15:08.373
Copy.

15:08.425 --> 15:09.757
-She sounds in a good mood.
-Doesn't she?

15:09.793 --> 15:11.342
Yeah, she can be difficult.

15:11.378 --> 15:13.294
Push this in if you can
move the vacuum for me.

15:13.329 --> 15:15.296
It's not in the way,
just push it.

15:15.332 --> 15:17.465
When did this become obvious?

15:17.500 --> 15:20.468
I really started noticing
it when the whole bow thing,

15:20.503 --> 15:22.637
when I came down on her
and wes about it.

15:22.672 --> 15:24.772
I mean, her eyes nearly rolled
off her ----ing head.

15:24.808 --> 15:27.809
You guys said you did the rescue
tender and the jet-skis.

15:27.844 --> 15:30.011
Well, captain lee went up
and saw your handiwork...

15:30.030 --> 15:32.480
-Oh.
-And is pissed.

15:32.515 --> 15:34.032
Is something wrong?

15:34.067 --> 15:35.783
No, I haven't said anything.

15:35.819 --> 15:37.018
No, you don't have to
say anything if your eyes

15:37.037 --> 15:38.536
are rolling off the back
of your head.

15:38.571 --> 15:39.537
I told you, this has
nothing to do with you.

15:39.572 --> 15:41.022
Okay.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.824
She came and apologized
to me later, which was good.

15:42.859 --> 15:45.543
It's late in the season,
she's gonna have to step up.

15:45.578 --> 15:47.328
If somebody's just got
a case of the [bleep]-its,

15:47.363 --> 15:49.047
there's not much you
can do about that.

15:49.082 --> 15:53.001
But it's not like I can pull
another deckhand out of my ass,

15:53.036 --> 15:54.869
especially when
we're down a person.

15:54.888 --> 15:57.839
I've gotta figure out
a way to make this work.

15:57.874 --> 16:00.174
So, it's time to dig
a little deeper.

16:00.209 --> 16:01.676
I mean, she's doing the work.

16:01.711 --> 16:04.012
-Just lose the attitude.
-Just lose the attitude.

16:04.047 --> 16:05.079
[sighs]

16:08.518 --> 16:10.001
I'll wash all this sh--.

16:10.036 --> 16:13.171
I'll wash them too.
[bleep] yeah!

16:13.206 --> 16:14.455
I'm ready for you to
drop it down, eddie.

16:14.490 --> 16:16.507
Copy that.

16:16.543 --> 16:17.959
<i> One more plank please.</i>

16:20.630 --> 16:22.397
We are getting somewhere.

16:22.432 --> 16:23.931
Perfect!

16:23.967 --> 16:24.932
All we have to do
is get dressed now.

16:24.968 --> 16:26.167
Yeah.

16:26.186 --> 16:28.002
Ten minutes to show time,
everybody.

16:28.038 --> 16:29.503
Ten minutes away from rosé.

16:29.522 --> 16:30.504
Ten minutes away from...

16:30.523 --> 16:31.973
Rosé and bubbly.

16:32.008 --> 16:35.360
[grunting]

16:40.233 --> 16:41.482
[gargles]

16:44.204 --> 16:45.620
the slide is already out.

16:45.655 --> 16:47.422
They are suited and booted.

16:47.457 --> 16:48.656
That's what I'm talking about.

16:48.692 --> 16:49.657
You wanna grab
the welcome towels?

16:49.693 --> 16:50.658
Yeah.

16:50.694 --> 16:51.659
Champagne.

16:51.695 --> 16:52.960
They're coming.

16:52.996 --> 16:54.212
Hello, hello, good afternoon.

16:54.247 --> 16:55.413
-Excellent, thank you.
-Welcome aboard.

16:55.465 --> 16:57.165
Step down directly onto
the wood, okay?

16:57.200 --> 16:58.532
-Precious, precious cargo.
-All right, thank you.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.034
-Thank you kindly.
-Hello!

17:00.053 --> 17:01.302
Hello, how are you all?

17:01.337 --> 17:02.503
-Hello.
-Hi!

17:02.538 --> 17:04.105
Request permission
to come aboard.

17:04.140 --> 17:05.539
Permission granted.

17:05.558 --> 17:06.591
Thank you, sir.
Tony thornton.

17:06.643 --> 17:08.259
-Tony.
-My wife, porscha.

17:08.311 --> 17:09.427
Tony, welcome on board.

17:09.479 --> 17:10.428
-Cold towel?
-Darion mccullogh.

17:10.480 --> 17:12.313
-Darion.
-Tony, wes.

17:12.348 --> 17:14.048
This is really nice.

17:14.084 --> 17:16.601
To have just all-black couples
that travel together.

17:16.653 --> 17:18.386
Tony's got this swag...

17:18.421 --> 17:20.221
I mean, those wingtip shoes.

17:20.240 --> 17:23.024
Oh, god, that's a dream of mine,
to have the style like he does.

17:23.059 --> 17:24.525
Welcome aboard my seanna.

17:24.561 --> 17:27.328
I'm gonna have heather
show you around the boat,

17:27.363 --> 17:29.130
and we'll get this
party started.

17:29.165 --> 17:30.498
Let's get it started.

17:30.533 --> 17:31.916
So, first we'll take
off our shoes

17:31.951 --> 17:33.701
and I'll lead you
up to the top.

17:33.737 --> 17:36.003
This is our bridge deck aft.

17:36.039 --> 17:37.405
Oh, wow, beautiful.

17:37.440 --> 17:38.589
So, this is where
you'll be enjoying

17:38.625 --> 17:39.607
most of your meals,
if you choose.

17:39.642 --> 17:40.958
This is gorgeous.

17:41.010 --> 17:42.076
Oh, sweet jesus.

17:42.112 --> 17:43.377
This is the sundeck.

17:43.413 --> 17:44.946
Oh, wow.

17:44.981 --> 17:47.181
So, you've got your hot tub,
the slide.

17:47.217 --> 17:49.016
It's a very, very high slide.

17:49.052 --> 17:50.585
Let me see, let me see!

17:50.620 --> 17:52.186
I don't know, I don't know.

17:54.591 --> 17:55.623
Whew.

17:55.658 --> 17:56.624
You're all breathing hard.

17:56.659 --> 17:59.026
[laughing]

17:59.062 --> 18:00.228
so, this is your master suite.

18:00.263 --> 18:01.496
This is gorgeous.

18:01.531 --> 18:02.563
Love it, love it.

18:02.599 --> 18:04.031
I'm feeling a little parched.

18:04.067 --> 18:05.566
-Thank you kindly, sir.
-Of course.

18:05.602 --> 18:07.435
Perfect, thank you.

18:10.773 --> 18:12.273
We're gonna change clothes.

18:17.547 --> 18:18.513
What are you blowing up?

18:18.548 --> 18:19.514
It's a trampoline.

18:19.549 --> 18:21.048
[laughing]

18:21.084 --> 18:22.650
all righty, then,
where did heather go?

18:22.685 --> 18:24.051
I'm right here, sorry.

18:24.087 --> 18:26.137
So, if the skipper would oblige,

18:26.172 --> 18:27.755
we'd love to have him
join us tonight for dinner.

18:27.790 --> 18:29.490
Oh, lovely.

18:29.526 --> 18:31.092
We're thinking kinda tour of
the mediterranean,

18:31.127 --> 18:32.660
someone's allergic to shellfish.

18:32.695 --> 18:34.145
Mm-hmm.

18:34.180 --> 18:35.429
And then pete
doesn't like cheese.

18:35.464 --> 18:37.131
Now, with that said,
don't minimize

18:37.150 --> 18:38.599
what the rest of us can eat
just because of them.

18:38.634 --> 18:40.151
I mean, we love them,
but it is what it is.

18:40.186 --> 18:43.604
Tomorrow night, like,
all-out... Black-tie.

18:43.639 --> 18:45.039
So, what if we did,
like, a renewal

18:45.074 --> 18:46.473
of the vows kind of an idea.

18:46.493 --> 18:47.641
Oh, that's hot.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.477
And captain lee
could officiate.

18:49.512 --> 18:51.329
That is perfect,
thank you so much.

18:53.366 --> 18:54.365
How we doing for drinks?

18:56.352 --> 18:57.318
I can, yes.

18:57.353 --> 18:58.485
...Pineapple.

18:58.505 --> 18:59.820
Okay, great.

18:59.839 --> 19:02.089
So, two lemon drops.

19:02.125 --> 19:03.124
I'll try the lemon drops.

19:03.159 --> 19:04.992
Yep.

19:07.046 --> 19:09.096
The guests would love to invite
you to dinner this evening.

19:09.132 --> 19:10.831
Okay.
I'll do dinner with them.

19:10.850 --> 19:13.667
Their last evening
we're gonna renew their vows,

19:13.686 --> 19:16.170
and we would love for you
to be the officiant.

19:16.189 --> 19:19.056
He's, like, we just
wanna love up on our wives,

19:19.108 --> 19:20.507
and I said, how about
we renew our vows.

19:20.527 --> 19:22.143
-He's like, oh, my god.
-You suggested this?

19:22.178 --> 19:23.144
He's like,
"this is the best idea ever."

19:23.179 --> 19:24.178
you suggested this?

19:24.214 --> 19:25.696
All the... Yes, I did.

19:25.732 --> 19:28.533
I really do not
appreciate somebody

19:28.568 --> 19:33.204
volunteering me for anything
without consulting me first.

19:33.239 --> 19:36.057
That's a huge ----ing no-no.

19:36.092 --> 19:39.660
Before you volunteer me
next time, check with me.

19:39.695 --> 19:41.262
My apologies.

19:43.699 --> 19:45.199
Do you want me to set
yours right here?

19:45.218 --> 19:46.534
-Y'all wanna move to the table?
-Can we?

19:46.569 --> 19:47.869
Bread over there,
if you wanna go ahead

19:47.904 --> 19:49.370
and put the bread
in the basket for me.

19:49.389 --> 19:50.721
Chef rachel has a
couple platters ready,

19:50.757 --> 19:51.739
so I'm gonna start
to bring those up.

19:51.774 --> 19:53.540
Thank you.

19:53.560 --> 19:57.595
This is a scotch bonnet sauce,
to go with conch fritters.

19:57.647 --> 20:00.765
The theme for lunch is
caribbean, because guess what...

20:00.817 --> 20:02.717
We're in the caribbean!

20:02.752 --> 20:04.385
Good to go.

20:04.420 --> 20:05.736
And because they like spicy,

20:05.772 --> 20:08.856
I'm gonna make my scotch
bonnet murder sauce.

20:08.891 --> 20:11.759
Okay, conch fritters are ready
to roll, and so are the salads.

20:11.794 --> 20:15.079
It doesn't hit initially,
but it keeps building,

20:15.114 --> 20:17.365
and then tomorrow morning
when you're looking

20:17.400 --> 20:19.800
for your toilet paper
inside the freezer,

20:19.819 --> 20:21.569
you will scream my n

20:21.604 --> 20:23.971
wow, that sauce is crazy.

20:23.990 --> 20:26.841
Guys, the sauce is just like
our wives, sweet and hot.

20:26.876 --> 20:28.309
And there it is.

20:28.328 --> 20:29.677
Woo!

20:29.712 --> 20:30.828
-Thank you, brother.
-Sweet and hot, yeah.

20:30.863 --> 20:31.846
She tapping it out
in that kitchen.

20:31.881 --> 20:33.414
<i> Jake, jake, jake, wes.</i>

20:33.449 --> 20:34.649
Can you meet me back
at the swim platform?

20:34.684 --> 20:36.517
We have a provision
boat coming in.

20:36.552 --> 20:38.319
Yeah, copy that, I'm on my way.

20:38.338 --> 20:42.290
They are absolutely in love.

20:42.325 --> 20:43.291
Thank you so much.

20:43.326 --> 20:44.625
Thank you.

20:44.660 --> 20:45.960
Well, can I clear some
of this out of your way?

20:45.995 --> 20:47.194
Yes, please.

20:47.230 --> 20:48.629
Thank you guys so much.

20:48.665 --> 20:50.214
Let's go play
a little water sports.

20:50.266 --> 20:51.432
Hello!

20:51.467 --> 20:52.633
Imma go jet-skiing first.

20:52.669 --> 20:53.634
Cool.

20:55.521 --> 20:56.520
Thank you.

20:57.740 --> 20:59.540
That's fun.

20:59.575 --> 21:00.942
Woo!

21:03.346 --> 21:05.212
Woo!

21:05.248 --> 21:07.248
Hey, baby!

21:07.283 --> 21:08.950
-This is so much fun.
-Woo!

21:12.889 --> 21:14.488
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

21:14.524 --> 21:16.657
Ah!

21:18.828 --> 21:19.961
Goddamn it.

21:26.702 --> 21:28.535
This thing is disgusting.

21:28.554 --> 21:29.904
<i> Eddie, eddie.</i>

21:29.939 --> 21:31.672
Go ahead, lee.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.257
Check out where your
jet-skiers are going.

21:33.309 --> 21:34.842
Where are they?

21:34.877 --> 21:37.511
You know when you hang
around somebody long enough,

21:37.546 --> 21:39.230
you start, you know...

21:39.265 --> 21:41.399
Like how you guys
say "sick" all the time now?

21:41.434 --> 21:44.418
-Where's rayna and...
-Wes?

21:44.454 --> 21:46.904
-Yeah.
-They've just gone for lunch.

21:46.939 --> 21:48.439
-Sick.
-Sick.

21:48.491 --> 21:49.523
Yeah, yeah.

21:49.559 --> 21:51.525
We lost sight of
those two, so...

21:51.560 --> 21:52.693
Did they take off?

21:52.728 --> 21:54.528
From now on, you
make sure somebody else

21:54.563 --> 21:55.746
has eyes on the jet-skis.

21:55.782 --> 21:57.898
It's a huge no-no.

21:57.917 --> 22:00.835
The deck crew is not thinking.

22:00.870 --> 22:02.586
It seems like at every turn,

22:02.622 --> 22:04.622
if one of them isn't
----ing up, the other one is.

22:06.742 --> 22:07.742
[bleep]

22:07.777 --> 22:08.976
cushions, cushions, cushions.

22:09.012 --> 22:09.960
-We lost the big one.
-Yeah.

22:10.013 --> 22:11.278
-Yes.
-Sh--.

22:11.314 --> 22:12.630
That's a common-sense thing.

22:12.682 --> 22:15.916
Hey, wes, you need to
attach it to your stern

22:15.935 --> 22:17.351
so you get more ----ing pull.

22:17.387 --> 22:19.586
He's not getting it.

22:19.605 --> 22:21.856
They are just not
staying focused.

22:21.891 --> 22:23.891
This is lack of attention.

22:23.926 --> 22:25.860
You're on a mega-yacht,
goddamn it.

22:25.895 --> 22:27.061
Act like it.

22:27.096 --> 22:29.263
Wes, rayna, jake.

22:29.298 --> 22:30.815
What the [bleep] do you want?

22:30.867 --> 22:32.700
Go ahead.

22:32.735 --> 22:33.934
<i> Can you guys gimme</i>
<i> a hand out here, please?</i>

22:33.953 --> 22:35.936
<i> Copy that.</i>

22:35.955 --> 22:37.071
----Ing look.

22:37.106 --> 22:38.906
I know, I got bit too.

22:38.941 --> 22:40.658
Like, I'm not crazy,
everyone's like, you just...

22:40.710 --> 22:42.293
These are old bites.

22:42.328 --> 22:44.412
No, they're, like, new bites.

22:48.551 --> 22:50.718
Yay!
Perfect.

22:52.155 --> 22:53.621
Come up here with us, baby.

22:53.656 --> 22:56.057
That was cool,
they had so much fun.

22:56.092 --> 22:57.525
Right.

22:57.560 --> 22:58.526
Are we good to put
the jet-skis away?

22:58.561 --> 23:00.010
<i> Yeah, let's do it.</i>

23:00.063 --> 23:01.762
Fraser, heather, do you wanna
get changed into blacks?

23:06.102 --> 23:07.968
I'm ready to chill
out for a little bit.

23:07.987 --> 23:09.937
-Need a hand?
-No, I got it.

23:12.358 --> 23:14.325
<i> Eddie, why are you</i>
<i> washing down the skis?</i>

23:14.360 --> 23:16.110
<i> Because I'm here.</i>

23:16.145 --> 23:18.479
<i> Where's your crew?</i>
<i> That's what they're for.</i>

23:18.498 --> 23:20.581
<i> Pulling the nautibuoys in</i>
<i> behind us on the stern.</i>

23:20.616 --> 23:22.483
I wanna see somebody out
there, jake,

23:22.518 --> 23:23.834
<i> helping you fuel those things.</i>

23:23.870 --> 23:25.836
<i> Copy that,</i>
<i> we'll fuel them now.</i>

23:25.872 --> 23:28.589
Eddie's not a deckhand anymore,
he's a first officer,

23:28.624 --> 23:30.758
and he's doing the ----ing
menial task

23:30.793 --> 23:32.626
of washing a ----ing jet-ski.

23:32.662 --> 23:33.844
Where's his crew?

23:33.880 --> 23:35.463
Why are they not doing it?

23:35.498 --> 23:37.832
Probably texting.

23:37.867 --> 23:41.352
So, that sh-- gonna
come to an abrupt halt.

23:41.387 --> 23:43.837
<i> Rayna or wes, can you meet</i>
<i> me on the bow, please?</i>

23:43.856 --> 23:45.873
If I were you,
I'd get both of them up here.

23:45.908 --> 23:46.974
<i> -Copy.</i>
<i> -Copy that.</i>

23:47.009 --> 23:49.176
Oh ----ing hell.

23:49.195 --> 23:50.561
I'm not happy.

23:54.466 --> 23:57.268
<i> Rayna or wes, can you meet</i>
<i> me on the bow, please?</i>

23:57.303 --> 23:59.103
If I were you, I'd get
both of them up here.

23:59.138 --> 24:00.137
-Copy.
-Yeah, copy that.

24:00.173 --> 24:01.172
Oh ----ing hell.

24:02.408 --> 24:03.958
I'm not happy.

24:06.312 --> 24:08.462
He wants you guys to do it.
Have fun.

24:08.514 --> 24:10.080
It's... Mm, okay.

24:11.750 --> 24:14.101
How many deckhands does
it take to fuel a jet-ski?

24:14.137 --> 24:16.053
I [bleep]... Oh, buddy.

24:16.088 --> 24:17.972
I don't need you out
there fueling the jet-skis.

24:18.024 --> 24:20.124
I need them out there
fueling the jet-skis.

24:20.159 --> 24:22.443
They've got 10 minutes to finish
fueling and get in their blacks.

24:24.113 --> 24:25.596
<i> Hey, guys, just a reminder,</i>

24:25.615 --> 24:26.614
as soon as you're done,
get in your blacks there.

24:27.784 --> 24:29.767
Sick.

24:29.802 --> 24:32.119
-Cue the eye-roll.
-Yeah, did you see it?

24:32.155 --> 24:34.488
Uh-huh, sure did.

24:34.540 --> 24:36.540
If I see it again,
there's gonna be an issue.

24:36.576 --> 24:38.242
Got it.

24:38.277 --> 24:39.410
Call me when you're done,
please change to blacks.

24:39.445 --> 24:40.628
Yeah.

24:40.663 --> 24:41.662
Are we almost there
with that one?

24:41.714 --> 24:42.713
Yeah, it's done.

24:45.084 --> 24:48.586
Oh, my bed, I'm sorry
to treat you this way.

24:48.621 --> 24:51.322
I know we've been sleeping
together for six weeks.

24:51.357 --> 24:52.623
Go and get changed.

24:52.642 --> 24:54.758
I want this treatment
all the time.

24:54.793 --> 24:56.177
[laughing]

25:00.566 --> 25:02.833
I'm really excited to take
on this new task

25:02.869 --> 25:06.203
of making these people happy,
because last charter sucked...

25:06.239 --> 25:07.688
No pun intended.

25:11.110 --> 25:12.359
-Our sincerest apologies.
-Yay!

25:12.411 --> 25:14.411
She was just
straining it a bunch.

25:14.447 --> 25:16.580
You have to be bigger, better,
stronger, faster, smarter.

25:16.616 --> 25:19.500
There's no ----ing
room for error, goddamn it.

25:22.338 --> 25:25.189
So much for a ----ing shower.

25:28.377 --> 25:30.044
Jake, jake, lee.

25:30.096 --> 25:31.161
Come up to the wheelhouse,
please.

25:31.180 --> 25:32.379
Yeah, copy that.

25:32.431 --> 25:33.497
----Ing hell.

25:33.516 --> 25:34.548
Eddie, wheelhouse, please.

25:40.406 --> 25:41.522
Jake, have a seat.

25:41.557 --> 25:43.073
-Hey, jake.
-Hello.

25:43.109 --> 25:44.692
So, how's it going
with the deck crew?

25:44.727 --> 25:46.477
I've heard that rayna
does a lot of eye-rolling.

25:46.512 --> 25:47.528
She does.

25:47.563 --> 25:49.179
I see one more ----ing eye-roll,

25:49.215 --> 25:50.614
I'm gonna come apart
like a cheap suit.

25:50.650 --> 25:52.383
Copy that.

25:52.418 --> 25:55.185
What is with headphones?
They shouldn't be ever worn.

25:55.221 --> 25:56.453
It's a safety issue.

25:56.489 --> 25:57.755
You can't hear
the alarms go off.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.556
If I see somebody texting
on their phone

25:59.575 --> 26:02.359
during working hours,
I'm gonna come apart.

26:02.394 --> 26:04.862
I expect you and jake
to have a sit-down with them

26:04.897 --> 26:06.247
and tell them that's
how it's gonna be.

26:06.282 --> 26:07.431
Yep.

26:07.466 --> 26:08.632
Everybody on the deck team,

26:08.668 --> 26:09.884
including jake,
needs to step it up.

26:09.919 --> 26:11.752
Otherwise, captain lee
is gonna rip

26:11.804 --> 26:14.088
our soul out through our butts.

26:14.140 --> 26:15.439
-Pretty simple.
-Cheers.

26:19.445 --> 26:20.728
I'm ready.

26:20.763 --> 26:22.379
All right, should we go
to the... The laz?

26:22.398 --> 26:23.714
To the laz.

26:23.749 --> 26:25.900
They are so excited
about this party!

26:25.935 --> 26:28.118
Ow, [bleep].

26:28.154 --> 26:29.370
Deckhands, deckhands,
meet me in the laz.

26:29.405 --> 26:31.155
Sick.

26:31.190 --> 26:33.574
All I need is some grapes
and a naked man to feed me.

26:35.761 --> 26:37.411
I'm very excited for you.

26:37.463 --> 26:38.746
Why?

26:38.798 --> 26:40.698
Show me what the second
stripe is all about.

26:40.733 --> 26:42.549
I've been working
my second-stripe ass off

26:42.585 --> 26:44.385
since I bloody joined this ship.

26:44.420 --> 26:45.636
I know, but now you actually
have a stewardess who will,

26:45.671 --> 26:47.721
like, retain and be eager,

26:47.757 --> 26:50.557
and I'm really looking to you
to, like, teach her a lot.

26:50.593 --> 26:52.559
You are the right-hand man
on this vessel,

26:52.595 --> 26:54.428
and I want you to,
like, take that role.

26:54.480 --> 26:55.813
Good, she should be terrified.

26:55.848 --> 26:57.648
Yeah, okay,
but don't be too sassy.

26:57.683 --> 26:59.216
I'm joking.

26:59.251 --> 27:01.185
I can still tell
fraser's bothered

27:01.220 --> 27:03.587
by the new stew coming in,
and at this rate

27:03.623 --> 27:05.789
I just feel
like he's overreacting.

27:05.825 --> 27:07.724
I just need him to kinda
drop this right now

27:07.743 --> 27:09.526
and focus on the job at hand,

27:09.561 --> 27:11.912
and we'll deal with that other
sh-- when she gets here.

27:11.948 --> 27:13.330
Mm, no.

27:13.366 --> 27:14.898
A little more.

27:14.917 --> 27:17.251
Aren't pillars supposed
to be straight-on, though?

27:17.286 --> 27:19.236
Who are you?

27:19.255 --> 27:21.255
All right, so I've just been
in the bridge with captain,

27:21.290 --> 27:23.624
and he's just noticed
a few things.

27:23.676 --> 27:27.544
He doesn't want any of us
using our phones while working,

27:27.580 --> 27:31.348
he doesn't wanna see any of
us using our airpods, wes.

27:31.384 --> 27:33.267
I've got stuff I need
to work on as well

27:33.302 --> 27:34.768
which he's spoken to me about.

27:34.804 --> 27:37.471
He doesn't wanna see
any, like, eye-rolling

27:37.523 --> 27:39.807
or anything like that.

27:39.859 --> 27:41.809
Careful, the eye-rolling
happening.

27:41.861 --> 27:43.477
-I didn't eye-roll.
-Okay.

27:43.529 --> 27:45.446
I just smiled.

27:45.481 --> 27:46.780
You guys should be able
to handle most of

27:46.816 --> 27:48.298
this sh-- on your own by now.

27:48.334 --> 27:50.200
Cool with that?

27:50.236 --> 27:51.201
Sounds good to me.

27:51.237 --> 27:52.236
Cool.

27:53.656 --> 27:54.788
You look beautiful.

27:54.824 --> 27:56.457
Thank you, so do you.

27:56.492 --> 27:57.474
-Thank you.
-So handsome.

27:57.510 --> 27:58.492
Getting some glitter on.

27:58.544 --> 28:00.210
<i> Rayna, rayna, eddie.</i>

28:00.246 --> 28:01.679
<i> You're gonna be helping</i>
<i> in the galley tonight.</i>

28:01.714 --> 28:03.180
<i> Copy, I'm on my way.</i>

28:03.215 --> 28:04.782
Excited about what's
being prepared.

28:07.853 --> 28:08.836
Captain lee is eating
dinner tonight?

28:11.674 --> 28:12.806
Good evening.

28:12.842 --> 28:14.291
Hi!

28:14.326 --> 28:15.659
-It's so pretty.
-It is beautiful.

28:15.695 --> 28:16.810
<i> Captain lee,</i>
<i> we're ready for you</i>

28:16.846 --> 28:19.513
<i> to come out whenever you are.</i>

28:19.565 --> 28:20.831
-Yep.
-Pop those little ----ers.

28:20.866 --> 28:22.366
Period!

28:22.401 --> 28:23.500
I love cooking.

28:23.536 --> 28:25.635
I enjoy working in the galley.

28:25.654 --> 28:27.654
I'm learning so
much every day.

28:27.690 --> 28:29.339
I'm gonna have you fire
the bread, rayna.

28:29.375 --> 28:30.941
Yes, ma'am.

28:30.976 --> 28:32.409
Remember how I taught you how
to cut the bread on a bias?

28:32.445 --> 28:33.777
-On a bias, yeah.
-Yes, ma'am.

28:33.813 --> 28:36.646
I love seeing another
woman being such a boss.

28:36.665 --> 28:38.482
The bitch is the queen bee.

28:38.517 --> 28:42.619
My proteins are just
the camarones, the lamb...

28:42.655 --> 28:45.289
Oh, and prosciutto
and everything? Like, good.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.024
-Yeah.
-I love rachel.

28:47.059 --> 28:48.876
I look like a 12-year-old at
a justin bieber concert

28:48.928 --> 28:51.929
when I see her.

28:51.964 --> 28:53.847
Yeah, and then
we're gonna fire the bread

28:53.883 --> 28:55.516
when it gets closer to it.

28:55.551 --> 28:57.267
Thank you for
joining us, skipper.

28:57.303 --> 28:58.435
Thank you for having me.

28:58.471 --> 28:59.536
Looking forward to this.

29:00.639 --> 29:02.639
We only have one of these left?

29:02.675 --> 29:05.692
We could just do two spoons,
like [makes noise].

29:05.728 --> 29:07.277
Yeah, good call.

29:07.313 --> 29:08.562
And then we're gonna
want sauce as well.

29:08.614 --> 29:10.347
You're ----ing
killing it, rachel.

29:10.382 --> 29:12.883
I hope you will forgive me
for having my radio with me,

29:12.918 --> 29:14.384
but I need to.

29:14.420 --> 29:15.719
-Oh, that's...
-No, you're fine.

29:15.755 --> 29:16.703
You know, in the navy,
that's it,

29:16.739 --> 29:18.038
you do what you have to do.

29:18.074 --> 29:21.725
-No crime in doing hard work.
-Nope, no.

29:21.761 --> 29:24.711
This evening, we're gonna take
you through a tour of the med.

29:24.747 --> 29:26.530
So, we're gonna start off with
a little bit of tapas,

29:26.549 --> 29:28.265
then you've got your morsicos.

29:28.300 --> 29:30.634
We have a quattro fungi
linguini coming up as well,

29:30.669 --> 29:32.419
as well as a bruschetta.

29:32.471 --> 29:34.638
And if you'd like anything
to add on, feel free...

29:34.673 --> 29:35.806
I'm here for you.

29:35.841 --> 29:37.841
Oh, my goodness,
this is fabulous.

29:57.563 --> 29:58.529
Mm-hmm, yeah, sure.

30:02.952 --> 30:04.601
We'll get it right.

30:04.637 --> 30:06.920
They just told me they want,
like, a piece of fish or

30:06.956 --> 30:08.705
a piece of chicken, because
she's allergic to the shellfish.

30:08.740 --> 30:10.841
His wife just said, "can you get
me a piece of lamb

30:10.876 --> 30:11.842
that doesn't have cheese on it,"

30:11.877 --> 30:13.777
because she's like,

30:13.813 --> 30:15.879
"he'll absolutely collapse if
dairy even touched his lamb."

30:17.683 --> 30:19.349
right.

30:19.385 --> 30:20.517
We don't have any other
piece of lamb down there?

30:24.790 --> 30:26.440
Absolute nightmare.

30:26.475 --> 30:28.592
This is what happens
when you're exhausted.

30:28.611 --> 30:30.760
And you spent 30 years
in the navy?

30:30.779 --> 30:31.962
Thty years.

30:31.997 --> 30:33.697
He served in the army,

30:33.732 --> 30:35.632
but listen,
don't hold that against him.

30:35.668 --> 30:36.650
We had to balance.

30:36.702 --> 30:38.035
I get it.

30:38.070 --> 30:40.003
I, for one, appreciate
the hell out of it.

30:41.657 --> 30:44.324
So, chef rachel has one more
course coming up,

30:44.376 --> 30:46.793
pasta and some more
on the italian side.

30:46.829 --> 30:49.079
We're still waiting on lamb
and chicken down here.

30:50.082 --> 30:51.915
Chicken, lamb.

30:54.787 --> 30:56.086
The chicken will be up
in just a moment,

30:56.121 --> 30:57.971
and the lamb is also
a very few minutes away

30:58.007 --> 30:59.473
from bringing that one up.

30:59.508 --> 31:00.507
[bleep]

31:03.846 --> 31:05.529
-really?
-Yeah.

31:17.976 --> 31:19.610
I get very flustered.

31:19.645 --> 31:21.528
I really do wanna
make them happy.

31:23.515 --> 31:24.748
I'm about to lose my sh--.

31:29.121 --> 31:30.120
Okay.

31:36.361 --> 31:38.812
The preference sheet
didn't say dairy intolerant.

31:41.450 --> 31:43.033
Mm.

31:43.068 --> 31:44.117
Okay, I'll be sure to...

31:47.122 --> 31:48.238
Definitely.

31:51.827 --> 31:53.377
-Thank you.
-It's all right.

31:53.412 --> 31:56.529
So, minimum dairy's wife
said just so you know,

31:56.548 --> 31:59.499
I'm absolutely appalled
at the service tonight.

31:59.534 --> 32:01.301
We all like to eat together.

32:01.337 --> 32:03.921
And I said, I'm so sorry,
it's just because...

32:03.973 --> 32:05.923
The preference sheet
said minimum dairy.

32:05.975 --> 32:08.208
And she was like,
oh, no, it doesn't.

32:08.227 --> 32:10.444
You know, she goes like this.

32:10.479 --> 32:12.813
Okay.
Well, that's okay.

32:12.848 --> 32:14.348
It's like daggers
at the table right now.

32:15.401 --> 32:17.317
That's okay, we're good.

32:19.388 --> 32:21.438
I'm gonna take the chicken
up as I take the pasta.

32:21.490 --> 32:22.923
Her chicken's ready.

32:22.958 --> 32:24.157
Ah ha!

32:24.193 --> 32:25.592
Could I offer you some chicken?

32:25.628 --> 32:27.294
Thank you.

32:27.329 --> 32:28.962
You want some chicken?

32:28.998 --> 32:32.065
No, I'm good, thank you.
I'm done for the night.

32:32.084 --> 32:33.083
-For real?
-Yeah, for real.

32:33.118 --> 32:34.101
How's everything going?

32:34.136 --> 32:35.402
This one has minimum dairy,

32:35.421 --> 32:36.586
but apparently dies
if he eats dairy.

32:36.622 --> 32:38.455
Okay.

32:38.507 --> 32:40.574
And then this one won't eat
anything other than chicken,

32:40.609 --> 32:42.376
pretty much.

32:42.411 --> 32:44.294
And then she doesn't do beef,
pork, and shellfish...

32:44.346 --> 32:46.013
Allergic.

32:46.048 --> 32:48.131
-For you.
-Thanks so much.

32:48.183 --> 32:49.933
Oh, my god,
you didn't need a rack.

32:49.969 --> 32:51.251
Yes, oh!

32:51.287 --> 32:52.252
Yes, they cooked him
a whole new rack.

32:52.271 --> 32:53.487
Yeah.

32:53.522 --> 32:54.888
Come here.

32:54.923 --> 32:56.156
Nowhere does it say "no dairy."

32:56.191 --> 32:57.291
no, it's her.

32:57.326 --> 33:00.143
-Oh, it's melissa.
-Oh!

33:00.195 --> 33:01.528
Lactose intolerant's
a little bit different.

33:01.563 --> 33:03.096
I know, but that's my fault.

33:03.132 --> 33:05.032
No wonder why
she's pissed at me.

33:16.478 --> 33:17.477
Mm-hmm.

33:20.182 --> 33:21.315
Anyway, would you like a hand?

33:21.350 --> 33:22.449
That would be great.

33:22.484 --> 33:24.267
I'm just a bit tired, you know?

33:24.320 --> 33:26.353
I feel like I'm having to think
about a thousand things at once.

33:26.388 --> 33:27.487
Yeah.

33:27.523 --> 33:28.572
We haven't got enough hands.

33:28.607 --> 33:30.023
I'll be around.

33:30.059 --> 33:31.024
I'll help you out tonight.

33:31.060 --> 33:32.025
Cheers, mate.

33:32.060 --> 33:34.060
[bleep] you, ----ing bitch

33:34.079 --> 33:36.229
get the [bleep]
on there, I swear to god.

33:36.248 --> 33:37.564
-Ready?
-Yeah, just run 'em.

33:37.583 --> 33:39.166
-Cool.
-All right, cool.

33:39.201 --> 33:40.167
This can go to all
the women, though.

33:40.202 --> 33:41.568
Yeah.

33:41.587 --> 33:43.120
But you're welcome to join us
each night.

33:43.172 --> 33:44.588
Well, thank you.

33:44.623 --> 33:46.039
Please know you have a
standing invitation with us.

33:46.074 --> 33:47.274
I don't need one, I'm good.

33:47.309 --> 33:48.458
-No?
-I'm good.

33:48.510 --> 33:50.410
Thank you.

33:50.429 --> 33:51.411
Can you give that to him?

33:51.447 --> 33:53.347
No, no, no, uh-uh, dairy.

33:53.382 --> 33:54.848
[laughs]

33:54.883 --> 33:56.516
see?

33:56.552 --> 33:58.018
So, that's a chocolate mousse
with a caramel ice cream.

33:58.053 --> 34:00.303
And yours is a
vegan chocolate mousse

34:00.356 --> 34:01.988
made with avocado and cacao.

34:02.024 --> 34:03.223
All right.

34:03.258 --> 34:04.358
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

34:04.393 --> 34:05.892
Mm-hmm.

34:05.927 --> 34:08.395
-It is perfecto.
-It's delicious.

34:08.430 --> 34:09.896
How is everybody doing?

34:09.931 --> 34:10.897
You're just amazing.

34:10.932 --> 34:12.449
Thank you.

34:12.484 --> 34:13.533
And next time, I'll make
sure that I don't use

34:13.569 --> 34:16.119
anything lactose as a garnish.

34:16.155 --> 34:18.155
That's my bad,
and I'm very sorry.

34:18.207 --> 34:19.906
I'll also make sure
if you'd like

34:19.941 --> 34:23.493
I'll have a chicken side
available at all times as well.

34:24.663 --> 34:26.963
So everyone can be
happy and fed,

34:26.999 --> 34:29.616
so nobody needs to be cranky.

34:29.635 --> 34:31.168
-Hungry and angry.
-Hangry.

34:31.220 --> 34:32.886
-Yeah, hangry.
-It's a real thing.

34:32.921 --> 34:35.172
I get the eye-droops,
and then I just look like

34:35.224 --> 34:37.424
I'm gonna snack on
the youngest deckhand.

34:37.459 --> 34:39.226
The youngest deckhand.

34:39.261 --> 34:41.344
Yeah, but that's actually
my cougar coming out.

34:41.397 --> 34:43.346
Yay!

34:43.399 --> 34:44.564
Wow, wow, wow,

34:44.600 --> 34:46.433
right into my den,
come on in...

34:46.468 --> 34:49.319
Num, num, num.

34:49.354 --> 34:50.970
Anyway...

34:50.989 --> 34:52.155
We look forward to breakfast.

34:52.191 --> 34:53.356
Thank you.

34:53.409 --> 34:54.357
All right, see you
in the morning.

34:54.410 --> 34:55.409
Absolutely.

35:05.003 --> 35:06.670
I love you guys, but...

35:06.705 --> 35:08.622
I'm about to call it quits.

35:08.657 --> 35:10.674
I am, as well.

35:10.709 --> 35:12.426
-Okay.
-Hope you have a great evening.

35:12.461 --> 35:13.627
-All right, you too.
-Thank you so much.

35:13.662 --> 35:15.128
-Sleep well.
-Thanks so much.

35:15.163 --> 35:16.596
-Thank you, skipper.
-Oh, my pleasure.

35:16.632 --> 35:18.048
Ugh!

35:18.100 --> 35:19.433
What?

35:19.468 --> 35:20.684
Tonight was a disaster.

35:20.719 --> 35:22.269
Sleep well, darling.

35:22.304 --> 35:23.687
Ugh.

35:23.722 --> 35:25.272
Shoot myself in the face.

35:30.279 --> 35:31.561
-Cheers, mate.
-Good night, all right?

35:31.613 --> 35:33.563
-Yeah, see you in the morning.
-Nice job.

35:42.291 --> 35:43.957
I'm staying up till
1:00 to help you.

35:43.992 --> 35:45.659
That's very sweet of you.

35:45.694 --> 35:46.660
We've got someone else coming,
and that's what we need.

35:46.695 --> 35:48.411
Yeah.

35:48.464 --> 35:50.464
But I'm working for
her tip right now.

35:50.499 --> 35:53.533
Yeah, I'd probably be quite
upset as well, to be fair.

35:53.569 --> 35:55.502
I just, like,
honestly, I despair.

35:55.537 --> 35:58.555
I feel, like, insecure,
do you know what I mean?

35:58.590 --> 36:00.039
Yeah.

36:00.058 --> 36:02.259
Oh, I just need to
be more confident.

36:02.311 --> 36:03.343
Yeah.

36:03.378 --> 36:05.262
Anyway, vent done.

36:05.314 --> 36:07.097
I'm just gonna give
her the side-eye.

36:17.058 --> 36:18.124
Thanks, buddy.

36:18.160 --> 36:19.359
No worries, mate, good night.

36:30.672 --> 36:32.205
I'm tired.

36:34.676 --> 36:35.642
Good morning.

36:35.677 --> 36:36.626
Is your stomach up yet?

36:36.678 --> 36:38.478
I had cereal with real milk,

36:38.514 --> 36:41.631
and I'm just
feeling the reprecautions

36:41.683 --> 36:43.350
of that one real fast.

36:43.385 --> 36:44.584
"repercussions."

36:44.603 --> 36:45.785
reper...

36:45.821 --> 36:47.470
[bleep] me and
my lingo these days.

36:47.523 --> 36:49.055
That's how exhausted I am.

36:49.091 --> 36:50.090
-Morning, cap.
-Morning, eddie.

36:52.144 --> 36:53.777
[bleep]

36:53.812 --> 36:56.196
so, I've been thinking about
our conversation yesterday.

36:56.231 --> 36:58.331
I don't wanna see eye-rolls.

36:58.367 --> 37:01.434
There's always a reason
for somebody's behavior.

37:01.453 --> 37:03.153
You have to always
keep that in mind.

37:03.205 --> 37:07.157
People do not do things
for no reason whatsoever.

37:07.209 --> 37:09.576
-Well...
-It's pretty goddamn rare.

37:14.216 --> 37:15.649
I checked out during
the whole thing.

37:21.390 --> 37:22.689
We had a great day yesterday.

37:22.724 --> 37:23.757
This whole charter
has been chill.

37:23.792 --> 37:25.725
So, where does this come from?

37:25.761 --> 37:28.228
You know, it's probably coming
from either jake and heather...

37:28.263 --> 37:30.430
There could be something
extraneous happening that...

37:30.465 --> 37:33.350
-We don't know about?
-You don't know about.

37:33.402 --> 37:35.134
Yeah.

37:35.153 --> 37:38.688
I'm not going out of my way.
I just wanna... Yeah.

37:38.740 --> 37:39.689
-All right, deal.
-Yep.

37:39.741 --> 37:41.675
Deal, deal, deal.

37:41.710 --> 37:43.326
It's time to find out
what's going on.

37:43.362 --> 37:44.694
Okay.

37:44.746 --> 37:46.145
So that you can get
a hold of things

37:46.164 --> 37:47.364
before they get blown out.

37:47.416 --> 37:48.665
Mm-hmm.

37:48.700 --> 37:50.250
After this charter,
I'll do that.

37:50.285 --> 37:51.651
You will do that today,
during this charter.

37:51.670 --> 37:52.652
-Okay.
-Okay.

37:52.671 --> 37:53.653
It needs to be done.

37:57.391 --> 37:59.225
Busy day today.

37:59.261 --> 38:00.994
Lifting the hook,
going over to major's bay,

38:01.029 --> 38:03.463
set up cocktails and things
to do at the beach.

38:06.985 --> 38:08.118
[snoring]

38:11.206 --> 38:13.290
my mum would be so proud of me,

38:13.325 --> 38:15.325
not that she's ever
ironed in her life, but...

38:15.377 --> 38:16.960
Today's a good day.

38:16.995 --> 38:18.461
-You know why?
-Got caviar?

38:18.497 --> 38:22.482
One, two, three, four.
Caviar, not leave on the dock.

38:22.517 --> 38:24.384
One, two, three, four,

38:24.419 --> 38:26.086
caviar's not gonna
fall on the floor

38:26.121 --> 38:27.120
hey!

38:30.425 --> 38:31.758
[yawns]

38:31.793 --> 38:33.226
oh, man.

38:33.261 --> 38:34.894
So, what do you need to do
on your boat, still?

38:34.930 --> 38:37.230
Starting with I need to get
a higher insurance.

38:37.265 --> 38:39.099
Realistically, this will
allow me to take

38:39.134 --> 38:41.851
12 passengers on my boat
and make more money.

38:41.903 --> 38:44.387
Ooh, that's super awesome.

38:44.423 --> 38:45.905
I wanna y a sailboat.

38:45.941 --> 38:48.508
Easy way to make money,
and it's fun.

38:48.543 --> 38:50.310
But I need to learn how to sail.

38:51.480 --> 38:53.263
-Thank you, baby.
-Absolutely.

38:53.315 --> 38:54.948
Oh, wow, it's raining.

38:54.983 --> 38:56.216
Rayna, rayna, eddie,
just a head's up...

38:56.251 --> 38:58.251
I want you pulling
the anchor today.

38:58.286 --> 38:59.436
Copy.

38:59.488 --> 39:01.855
The morale on deck team
is in the dumps.

39:01.890 --> 39:03.356
Captain lee's only
been seeing negatives.

39:03.391 --> 39:05.592
So, I wanna give these
opportunities to look good,

39:05.627 --> 39:09.395
because they need some
positive reinforcement now,

39:09.414 --> 39:11.564
some attaboys.

39:11.583 --> 39:13.566
And attagirls, of course.

39:13.585 --> 39:15.585
Okay, rayna,
let's get outta here.

39:15.620 --> 39:17.037
Copy.

39:17.072 --> 39:18.404
Oh ----ing great.

39:18.423 --> 39:20.290
-I'm going out there with her.
-Okay.

39:20.342 --> 39:22.508
Her special this morning is
gonna be the shrimp and grits.

39:22.527 --> 39:24.027
I want the special,

39:24.062 --> 39:25.511
but still throw in there
a seafood omelette.

39:25.530 --> 39:27.063
I'm gonna do the
shrimp and grits.

39:27.115 --> 39:28.281
Seafood omelette
with egg whites.

39:28.316 --> 39:29.549
For you?

39:29.584 --> 39:31.067
Strawberry crepes
sounds excellent.

39:31.119 --> 39:32.452
Throw a crepe on mine
as well, why not?

39:32.487 --> 39:33.536
We'll get that started.

39:33.572 --> 39:35.922
Oh, look, I got twins.

39:35.957 --> 39:38.041
That must be good luck.

39:38.076 --> 39:40.126
So, the name of this game is

39:40.162 --> 39:42.028
you're gonna tell him where
it is and what's going on.

39:42.047 --> 39:43.529
I always kinda keep looking up

39:43.548 --> 39:45.031
and checking the bow and see
how she's swinging...

39:45.050 --> 39:46.299
-Okay.
-And then watch the wind.

39:46.334 --> 39:49.302
The anchor is
at 9:00 short stay.

39:52.374 --> 39:53.339
Go easy on her.

39:53.374 --> 39:55.175
Yeah.

39:55.210 --> 39:56.242
You see how it kinda comes tight
and it's really, [makes noise]?

39:58.096 --> 39:59.512
Yeah.

40:02.317 --> 40:03.483
<i> -Lock it in.</i>
-Good job, rayna.

40:03.518 --> 40:04.901
Thank you.

40:04.936 --> 40:06.052
Three crepes, one omelette.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.487
The shellfish allergy,

40:07.522 --> 40:09.989
she said she wants some
chicken sausage and grits.

40:10.025 --> 40:13.159
And she wants an egg white
scramble with cheese again.

40:13.195 --> 40:14.560
Let's do it.

40:14.579 --> 40:16.162
Only the thing is
is with the strawberries...

40:16.198 --> 40:18.031
Yeah.

40:18.066 --> 40:19.866
Is there anyone that can cut
them for me as I'm doing...

40:19.901 --> 40:21.201
Yes, yes, 100 percent.

40:21.236 --> 40:23.069
She nailed it.
Tell her to come here.

40:26.141 --> 40:27.957
-Hello!
-Morning, kiddo.

40:28.009 --> 40:30.260
I think that's one of
the best anchor pulls we've had.

40:30.295 --> 40:32.612
-Thanks, guys.
-So, you did good.

40:32.647 --> 40:33.880
Let's get outta here.

40:44.226 --> 40:46.025
<i> Rayna, rayna,</i>
<i> heather?</i>

40:46.061 --> 40:48.361
Rachel needs help cutting
some strawberries.

40:48.396 --> 40:50.096
Shut the [bleep] up [bleep].

40:50.132 --> 40:51.531
We can use a sous chef.

41:06.997 --> 41:17.557
..........

41:20.462 --> 41:22.228
-Hello.
-What's up?

41:22.264 --> 41:24.514
Can we get rayna's help, please?

41:24.566 --> 41:25.965
Of course, what's up?

41:25.984 --> 41:28.268
-In the galley.
-Yeah, let's do it.

41:28.303 --> 41:29.269
<i> Copy that.</i>

41:29.304 --> 41:30.603
What's wrong, darling?

41:33.492 --> 41:35.024
-What the [bleep] was that?
-What was that?

41:35.076 --> 41:36.276
-Are you okay?
-What's up, heather?

41:36.311 --> 41:38.311
-You all right?
-Yeah.

41:38.346 --> 41:39.646
-What's up?
-What's going on?

41:39.681 --> 41:41.581
Check and see
if everything's okay.

41:41.616 --> 41:43.416
Yeah.

41:43.451 --> 41:45.084
I don't wanna...
It's okay.

41:45.120 --> 41:46.619
Nothing, rachel just
needed some help.

41:46.654 --> 41:48.254
I will help.

41:50.325 --> 41:52.225
Is everything all right?
What was that noise?

41:52.260 --> 41:53.693
That was rayna, she's crying.

41:53.728 --> 41:54.994
-Why?
-I don't know.

41:55.013 --> 41:56.379
Rachel, I'm coming.

41:56.431 --> 41:57.496
I'm gonna grab my
glasses really fast.

41:57.516 --> 41:59.666
Ooh.

41:59.701 --> 42:01.434
I feel so bad.

42:11.613 --> 42:13.046
Next, on "below deck"...

42:13.081 --> 42:14.414
Hi!

42:14.449 --> 42:17.083
Well, well, well, look
what the cat dragged in.

42:18.320 --> 42:19.619
-I don't care.
-Yeah.

42:19.654 --> 42:21.237
You're coming in as a third,

42:21.289 --> 42:22.622
and you're gonna help
where we need you.

42:22.657 --> 42:25.291
I'm still the baddest bitch
on board.

42:25.327 --> 42:26.726
Oh, my gosh.

42:26.761 --> 42:30.463
I take you, once again,
to be my partner in life.

42:30.498 --> 42:31.698
That calls for an "I do."

42:31.733 --> 42:34.133
I do.

42:34.169 --> 42:35.168
Ah!

42:35.203 --> 42:36.669
I love it.

42:36.705 --> 42:38.605
It's honestly something
people my age need to see.

42:38.640 --> 42:40.256
-Oh, he's naked again.
-Oh!

42:40.308 --> 42:41.507
Of course he is.

42:43.478 --> 42:45.178
Careful, jake, careful, jake!

42:46.348 --> 42:49.148
-Jake, you asshole!
-Jake!

42:49.184 --> 42:51.317
Ah!

42:51.353 --> 42:53.019
Jake, put your willy away!
