00:02.435 --> 00:04.003
<i>"LAST MAN STANDING"</i>

00:04.005 --> 00:06.138
<i>IS RECORDED IN FRONT</i>
<i>OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.</i>

00:06.140 --> 00:07.673
IT'S BAD ENOUGH
WE LOST THE GAME.

00:07.675 --> 00:09.008
I DIDN'T EVEN GET
TO PLAY.

00:09.010 --> 00:10.642
WELL,
LOOK AT THE UPSIDE.

00:10.644 --> 00:12.678
I DON'T HAVE TO WASH
YOUR UNIFORM.

00:12.680 --> 00:15.147
YOUR DAD IS HAPPY
'CAUSE YOU SPENT THE NIGHT

00:15.149 --> 00:17.816
WITH FOOTBALL PLAYERS
AND DIDN'T SEE ANY ACTION.

00:17.818 --> 00:20.185
IT'S COACH FOSTER'S FAULT
WE KEEP LOSING.

00:20.187 --> 00:22.688
I MEAN, HE ALWAYS CALLS
THE SAME FIVE PLAYS.

00:22.690 --> 00:25.357
YEAH, IS ONE OF THOSE PLAYS
GET SACKED AND LOSE SIX YARDS?

00:25.359 --> 00:27.359
THAT'S THE ONLY PLAY
YOU GUYS SEEM TO HAVE.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.394
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD

00:28.396 --> 00:30.129
CRITICIZE EVE'S COACH
IN FRONT OF HER.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.463
HE'S NO VINCE LOMBARDI.

00:31.465 --> 00:32.631
HE'S NOT EVEN VINCE,

00:32.633 --> 00:34.833
THAT WEIRD KID
THAT BAGS OUR GROCERIES.

00:34.835 --> 00:36.668
HE'S NOT A KID.
HE'S 40.

00:36.670 --> 00:39.204
AND WHAT BAGGER VINCE
LACKS IN SKILLS,

00:39.206 --> 00:40.806
HE MAKES UP FOR IN HUGS.

00:41.808 --> 00:44.043
I JUST THOUGHT BEING THE KICKER
ON THE FOOTBALL TEAM

00:44.045 --> 00:45.210
WOULD BE
A LITTLE MORE FUN.

00:45.212 --> 00:46.378
I MEAN, LOSING SUCKS.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.313
HONEY, YOU GOT TO TAKE THE BAD
WITH THE GOOD.

00:48.315 --> 00:49.715
I MEAN, ISN'T THAT ONE
OF THOSE LIFE LESSONS

00:49.717 --> 00:51.150
THAT SPORTS
IS SUPPOSED TO TEACH YOU?
NO.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.819
LOSING COACH SAYS THAT SO
THE KIDS WON'T CRY ON THE BUS.

00:53.821 --> 00:56.755
KYLE JUST CALLED AND SAID
THAT HE CRASHED HIS MOTORCYCLE.

00:56.757 --> 00:58.190
WHAT?
OH, MY GOD,
MY POOR BOYFRIEND.

00:58.192 --> 01:00.159
IS IT SERIOUS?
WELL, WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER
FOR TWO YEARS,

01:00.161 --> 01:01.560
BUT NOW IS NO TIME
TO TALK ABOUT THAT.

01:01.562 --> 01:02.928
HE'S HURT.

01:04.064 --> 01:07.132
-- Captions by VITAC --

01:10.904 --> 01:13.572
Ed: OH,
THERE YOU ARE, SON.

01:13.574 --> 01:16.075
GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.
YEAH.

01:16.077 --> 01:17.609
GOOD THING
HE HIT HIS HEAD --

01:17.611 --> 01:19.578
SOMETHING HE DOESN'T USE
HERE AT WORK.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.346
YEAH, THE, UH,
DOCTOR SAID I GOT

01:21.348 --> 01:23.582
A PRETTY NASTY BUMP
ON THE BACK OF MY HEAD.

01:23.584 --> 01:26.251
BACK OF YOUR HEAD?

01:26.253 --> 01:28.087
WHAT'S THIS, THEN?

01:28.089 --> 01:30.222
THE FRONT OF MY HEAD.

01:30.224 --> 01:33.192
YOU CAN TELL
'CAUSE IT'S GOT A FACE ON IT.

01:33.194 --> 01:34.860
WHY THE BANDAGE?

01:34.862 --> 01:36.595
OH, THIS HAPPENED
AFTER THE ACCIDENT.

01:36.597 --> 01:39.431
I, UH, BURNT MY FOREHEAD
ON THE MUFFLER.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.433
DID YOU KNOW
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO WAIT

01:41.435 --> 01:43.936
FOR YOUR BIKE TO COOL DOWN
BEFORE YOU WORK ON IT?

01:43.938 --> 01:45.270
YES.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.373
SO, YOU WERE NOT WEARING
A HELMET.

01:48.375 --> 01:50.476
AS MR. B SAYS,
"HELMETS ARE FOR LADIES

01:50.478 --> 01:52.478
WHO DON'T WANT
TO MUSS THEIR HAIR."

01:52.480 --> 01:54.213
OR IF YOU'RE BEING SHOT
OUT OF A CANNON.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.948
AND IF YOU DON'T WEAR A HELMET
DOING THAT,

01:55.950 --> 01:58.984
YOU'RE JUST SHOWING OFF.

01:58.986 --> 02:00.886
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO HOME,
TAKE A LITTLE REST DAY, HMM?

02:00.888 --> 02:04.223
NO, NO, THE DOCTOR SAID I NEED
TO STAY AWAKE FOR 24 HOURS,

02:04.225 --> 02:07.126
WHICH SHOULDN'T BE HARD
BECAUSE I SLEPT LIKE A BABY

02:07.128 --> 02:09.728
AFTER THE CRASH --
A BABY FLASHING

02:09.730 --> 02:13.298
IN AND OUT OF CONSCIOUSNESS
AND OCCASIONALLY VOMITING.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.833
[ SIGHS ]

02:14.835 --> 02:16.001
THERE SHOULD BE A LAW

02:16.003 --> 02:18.437
FORCING A KID THAT CARELESS
TO WEAR A HELMET.

02:18.439 --> 02:22.007
AND NOT JUST ON A MOTORCYCLE --
ALL DAY LONG.

02:22.009 --> 02:23.742
WE VALUE OUR FREEDOMS HERE
IN COLORADO.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.244
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT
A HELMET ON.

02:25.246 --> 02:27.412
YOU CAN RIDE YOUR MOTORCYCLE
RIGHT TO THE POT STORE,

02:27.414 --> 02:29.615
AND THEN COME HERE
AND BUY YOURSELF A RIFLE.

02:29.617 --> 02:32.117
IT'S AMAZING ANYONE'S
STILL ALIVE HERE IN COLORADO.

02:32.119 --> 02:33.919
STUPID ACCIDENTS
LIKE KYLE'S, THOUGH,

02:33.921 --> 02:35.654
CAN RAISE
OUR HEALTH-INSURANCE COSTS.

02:35.656 --> 02:38.490
I'M ALREADY PAYING
MORE TO MEET THE NEW
OBAMACARE REQUIREMENTS.

02:38.492 --> 02:39.658
AND I THOUGHT IF YOU LIKED

02:39.660 --> 02:42.661
YOUR PRESENT HEALTHCARE PLAN,
YOU COULD KEEP IT.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.163
NOW THEY'RE MAKING US
ADD STUFF

02:44.165 --> 02:45.831
LIKE VISION CARE
AND BIRTH CONTROL.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.199
IF WOMEN GET VISION CARE,

02:47.201 --> 02:49.268
OUR MEN WON'T NEED
BIRTH CONTROL.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.471
SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE MORE INTERESTED

02:52.473 --> 02:54.006
IN THE BOTTOM LINE
THAN KYLE'S HEAD.

02:54.008 --> 02:57.009
KYLE'S HEAD
IS A LOST CAUSE.

02:57.011 --> 02:59.278
WE SHOULD CONSIDER CUTTING
OUR EMPLOYEES TO PART TIME...

02:59.280 --> 03:01.647
NO.
...SO WE DON'T HAVE TO PAY
FOR THEIR HEALTHCARE.

03:01.649 --> 03:03.215
WE TAKE CARE OF OUR EMPLOYEES
AT OUTDOOR MAN.

03:03.217 --> 03:04.550
WE ALWAYS HAVE,
AND WE ALWAYS WILL.

03:04.552 --> 03:05.884
IF I CUT THEM LOOSE,

03:05.886 --> 03:07.686
THEY CAN GET THEIR OWN PLAN
ON THE PRIVATE EXCHANGE.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.021
I DON'T THINK SO.

03:09.023 --> 03:10.689
ANYBODY WHO CAN FIGURE OUT
THAT EXCHANGE

03:10.691 --> 03:12.191
IS TOO SMART
TO BE WORKING HERE.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.197
OHH.
OH, HEY,
DON'T BE STINGY, MOM.

03:18.199 --> 03:20.866
I'VE GOT TO CARBO-LOAD
FOR TOMORROW NIGHT'S GAME.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.301
AH, AH, AH, AH,
NONE FOR ME.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.469
I'M GONNA
PEACH-PIE-LOAD LATER.
Vanessa: OH.

03:26.306 --> 03:28.040
SO, ED IS
SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING

03:28.042 --> 03:30.209
CANCELING THE EMPLOYEE
HEALTHCARE PLAN?

03:30.211 --> 03:31.543
AS SERIOUS
AS A HEART ATTACK.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.245
IF ANYBODY AT WORK
WANTS A HEART ATTACK,

03:33.247 --> 03:35.747
THEY BETTER DO IT NOW.

03:35.749 --> 03:38.884
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I BLAME THIS ON<i> YOUR</i> PRESIDENT.

03:38.886 --> 03:41.553
YOU SAID THAT LAST MONTH
WHEN IT HAILED.

03:41.555 --> 03:44.723
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU ARE STILL
RAILING AGAINST OBAMACARE.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.059
WASN'T THAT, LIKE,
10 FAKE SCANDALS AGO?

03:47.061 --> 03:49.394
WELL, WE ALL AGREE
HE SCREWS UP A LOT,

03:49.396 --> 03:52.030
BUT I PREFER HIS EARLIER,
CLASSIC SCREW-UPS.

03:52.032 --> 03:53.198
I THINK
IT'S A NICE IMPULSE

03:53.200 --> 03:54.533
TO GIVE MORE AMERICANS
INSURANCE.

03:54.535 --> 03:55.834
BUT THAT'S NOT HIS JOB.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.169
WHO DOES HE THINK HE IS,

03:57.171 --> 03:59.938
THAT COOLER BLACK DUDE
ON THE ALLSTATE COMMERCIALS?

03:59.940 --> 04:01.773
WELL, I'M GRATEFUL
TO THE PRESIDENT

04:01.775 --> 04:03.709
THAT KYLE WAS COVERED
FOR HIS ACCIDENT.

04:03.711 --> 04:06.111
WELL, THE FEDS HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT, YOU KNOW.

04:06.113 --> 04:08.013
WE TOOK CARE OF KYLE
AT OUTDOOR MAN.

04:08.015 --> 04:10.415
WE TAKE CARE OF OUR EMPLOYEES
BECAUSE WE CHOOSE TO.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.251
IT'S LIKE WHEN I CHOOSE
TO EMPTY THE DISHWASHER.

04:12.253 --> 04:14.419
IT'S GREAT BECAUSE I CHOOSE IT.
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.388
IT'S BETTER THAN WHEN
YOUR MOM NAGS ME TO DO IT.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.857
WHEN HAVE YOU EVER EMPTIED
THE DISHWASHER?

04:18.859 --> 04:21.226
I'M JUST MAKING A POINT.

04:21.228 --> 04:22.561
OKAY.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.463
OH, HEY, KYLE.
HI.

04:24.465 --> 04:25.931
HEY, SORRY TO DISTURB
YOUR DINNER.

04:25.933 --> 04:26.932
YOU HUNGRY, KYLE?
HEY.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.133
OH, NO, IT'S OKAY.

04:28.135 --> 04:29.268
I ATE AT DENNY'S.

04:29.270 --> 04:30.836
NOT THE RESTAURANT,
MY NEIGHBOR.

04:32.138 --> 04:34.640
I ATE WITH HIM AND HIS WIFE,
IHOP.

04:34.642 --> 04:37.009
SHE'S FROM PAKISTAN.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.911
HEY, I, UH, HAVE MY BIKE
IN THE VAN.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.113
YOU SAID TO BRING IT BY.

04:41.115 --> 04:42.481
YEAH, WE CAN FIX IT,
AND THEN AFTER WE'RE DONE,

04:42.483 --> 04:43.482
I'LL RUN ALONGSIDE YOU

04:43.484 --> 04:44.983
TO MAKE SURE
YOU KNOW HOW TO RIDE IT.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.151
GOOD ONE, MR. B.

04:46.153 --> 04:47.919
YOU ROLL IT IN
AND I'LL CHANGE MY CLOTHES.

04:47.921 --> 04:50.455
UM, HEY, DAD.

04:50.457 --> 04:54.293
SO, KYLE STILL PLANS ON
RIDING HIS MOTORCYCLE?

04:54.295 --> 04:56.261
IT'S LIKE THAT OLD SLOGAN --
YOU FALL OFF A HORSE,

04:56.263 --> 04:57.629
YOU WANT TO GET
RIGHT BACK ON IT.

04:57.631 --> 04:58.563
THAT'S WHAT I TOLD HIM.

04:58.565 --> 04:59.665
AND THERE'S
A 50-50 CHANCE

04:59.667 --> 05:01.566
HE'LL ACTUALLY BRING A HORSE
INTO THE GARAGE.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.440
HEY.

05:08.442 --> 05:11.109
WOW.

05:11.111 --> 05:13.578
IT GOT THIS MESSED UP
IN YOUR ACCIDENT?

05:13.580 --> 05:14.813
IT ALSO FELL OUT OF MY VAN

05:14.815 --> 05:16.648
ROUNDING THE CORNER
ON BIRCH STREET.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.483
I NEED TO GET A BACK DOOR
FOR MY VAN.

05:18.485 --> 05:21.253
ALSO A NEW PATIO TABLE FOR
THAT RESTAURANT ON BIRCH STREET.

05:21.255 --> 05:23.755
KYLE, YOU WERE REALLY LUCKY
TO WALK AWAY

05:23.757 --> 05:26.091
FROM THIS ACCIDENT
WITH A CONCUSSION.

05:26.093 --> 05:28.660
I KNOW.
MY DREAMS HAVE BEEN AWESOME.

05:28.662 --> 05:31.496
NO, I MEAN WITH NOTHING WORSE
THAN A CONCUSSION.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.632
YOU COULD HAVE HAD
A SPINAL INJURY

05:33.634 --> 05:35.100
AND ENDED UP A PARALEGAL.

05:35.102 --> 05:37.169
MANDY,
I KNOW YOU WORRY.

05:37.171 --> 05:39.338
AND THAT'S WHY I'LL BE
WEARING A HELMET FROM NOW ON.

05:39.340 --> 05:41.039
BUT PLEASE
DON'T TELL YOUR DAD

05:41.041 --> 05:43.108
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT HIM
TO THINK OF ME

05:43.110 --> 05:45.310
AS A LADY
WHO CARES ABOUT MUSSED HAIR.

05:45.312 --> 05:48.980
NO, SWEETIE, I DON'T WANT YOU
RIDING IT AT ALL.

05:48.982 --> 05:52.351
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU
IN SOME STUPID ACCIDENT...

05:52.353 --> 05:54.353
OR EVEN A SMART ONE,

05:54.355 --> 05:57.322
LIKE WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO STEPHEN HAWKING.

05:57.324 --> 05:58.357
REALLY?

05:58.359 --> 06:00.359
NOT RIDE ANYMORE?

06:00.361 --> 06:02.527
PLEASE.

06:02.529 --> 06:03.862
OKAY.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.198
IF IT MEANS THAT MUCH TO YOU,
I'LL SELL THE BIKE.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.766
THANK YOU.

06:10.036 --> 06:13.939
MAYBE IT'S TIME I GET THAT HORSE
YOUR DAD KEEPS TALKING ABOUT.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.912
COME ON, HOW MANY DADS CAN SAY
THEIR TEENAGE DAUGHTER

06:20.914 --> 06:23.482
THREW THE WINNING TOUCHDOWN PASS
IN A FOOTBALL GAME?

06:23.484 --> 06:26.985
JUST YOU --
OVER AND OVER AND OVER.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.353
EVERYBODY IN THE PARKING LOT

06:28.355 --> 06:30.355
TO THE HOMELESS GUY
AT THE INTERSECTION.

06:30.357 --> 06:32.991
GEEZ, YOU SHOULD HAVE
AT LEAST GIVEN THE GUY A DOLLAR.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.826
I GAVE HIM SOMETHING BETTER --
AN INSPIRATIONAL STORY.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.027
COME ON.

06:36.029 --> 06:38.230
IF A TEENAGE GIRL
CAN THROW A TOUCHDOWN PASS

06:38.232 --> 06:40.732
ON AN ALL-BOYS FOOTBALL TEAM,
THE SKY'S THE LIMIT

06:40.734 --> 06:43.568
FOR A 40-YEAR-OLD ALCOHOLIC
WITH A DOG ON A ROPE.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.837
EVE WAS JUST SUPPOSED
TO KICK THE BALL,

06:45.839 --> 06:47.906
NOT MIX IT UP
WITH THOSE BURLY BOYS.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.274
THIS IS A PERFECT
FAKE FIELD GOAL.

06:49.276 --> 06:51.209
OHH, AGAIN.
I DON'T WANT TO.
SUPPOSED TO KICK IT.

06:51.211 --> 06:53.245
SHE ROLLS OUT, HITS THE GUY
IN THE END ZONE, AND TOUCHDOWN!

06:53.247 --> 06:54.679
Man:<i> TOUCHDOWN,</i>
<i>WOODBRIDGE HIGH!</i>

06:54.681 --> 06:55.947
YES!

06:55.949 --> 06:57.783
I WAS SCARED TO DEATH.

06:57.785 --> 07:01.119
BUT MY GIRL
SURE THROWS A SWEET SPIRAL.

07:01.121 --> 07:02.921
THAT WAS
A PERFECTLY DESIGNED PLAY.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.390
I TAKE BACK EVERYTHING I SAID
ABOUT THAT STUPID COACH.

07:05.392 --> 07:07.292
WELL, MAYBE
HE FINALLY HEARD YOU.

07:07.294 --> 07:08.293
I DON'T THINK SO.

07:08.295 --> 07:10.095
HE STILL WEARS
THAT UGLY VISOR.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.364
YEAH, WE GET IT.
YOU'VE BEEN TO SeaWorld.

07:12.366 --> 07:14.266
PLEASE, CAN YOU TRY
TO CONTAIN YOUR ENTHUSIASM

07:14.268 --> 07:15.600
IN FRONT
OF MANDY AND KRISTIN.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.202
THEY ALREADY FEEL
LIKE YOU FAVOR EVE.

07:17.204 --> 07:18.937
IT WOULD BE WEIRD
IF THEY DIDN'T.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.138
I MAKE IT PRETTY OBVIOUS.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.807
AH!

07:21.809 --> 07:23.074
HEY, HEY! TOUCHDOWN!
YEAH!

07:23.076 --> 07:25.243
THERE'S
MY FOOTBALL HERO!

07:25.245 --> 07:27.946
YOUR MOM HAS BEEN BRAGGING
ABOUT YOU SINCE THE GAME.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.614
WE'RE A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT
YOUR SISTERS, THOUGH --

07:29.616 --> 07:31.316
SILVER AND BRONZE.

07:31.318 --> 07:34.286
HONEY, SHOULDN'T YOU BE OUT
CELEBRATING WITH THE TEAM?

07:34.288 --> 07:36.221
I DON'T REALLY FEEL
LIKE CELEBRATING.

07:36.223 --> 07:37.155
WHY NOT?

07:37.157 --> 07:39.724
[ SIGHS ]
THE COACH BENCHED ME.

07:39.726 --> 07:41.159
AFTER WINNING THE GAME?!
HONEY...

07:41.161 --> 07:44.129
I TAKE BACK EVERYTHING
I TOOK BACK ABOUT THAT GUY.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.164
WHY DID
THE COACH BENCH YOU?

07:46.166 --> 07:48.467
YOU EXECUTED
HIS PLAY PERFECTLY.

07:48.469 --> 07:50.135
YEAH,
BUT IT WASN'T HIS PLAY.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.904
HE WANTED ME TO KICK
THE FIELD GOAL AND TIE THE GAME,

07:52.906 --> 07:54.873
