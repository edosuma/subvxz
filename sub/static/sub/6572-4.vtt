00:02.068 --> 00:05.401
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

00:05.505 --> 00:07.496
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

00:07.607 --> 00:09.598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:15.148 --> 00:16.843
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

00:19.185 --> 00:23.019
<i>Michael was heading to work when he saw
something he had never seen before lunch...</i>

00:23.123 --> 00:25.023
<i>his twin sister Lindsay.</i>

00:25.125 --> 00:28.117
- You're up?
- Yeah. I work for our attorney now.

00:28.228 --> 00:31.527
Bob Loblaw. Of course.
What is he thinking?

00:31.631 --> 00:33.690
- I mean, how's it going?
- Lousy.

00:33.800 --> 00:37.065
You know, I only took this nanny job
so he'd give me a free divorce...

00:37.170 --> 00:39.468
and then marry me so
I'd never have to work again.

00:39.572 --> 00:41.904
But all he seems to care about
is that daughter of his.

00:42.008 --> 00:44.101
I got my horse to canter today.
First time.

00:44.210 --> 00:46.474
I've always wanted
to make love on a horse.

00:46.579 --> 00:48.479
And tomorrow, we're gonna
work without a lunge line.

00:48.581 --> 00:51.812
That's so funny, because
I can put my leg behind my head.

00:51.918 --> 00:54.216
I mean, come on.
I'm the nanny.

00:54.320 --> 00:56.311
Of course. Who wouldn't wanna
snog the nanny?

00:56.423 --> 00:58.482
"Snog." Is that another
one of your new "Britishisms"?

00:58.591 --> 01:02.857
<i>It was. Michael had recently
fallen bum over noggin...</i>

01:02.962 --> 01:05.226
<i>for a beautiful English woman
called Rita.</i>

01:05.331 --> 01:07.231
Did I say snog again? Bloody hell.

01:07.333 --> 01:11.429
You wanna win over Bob, you gotta
win over the kid. Here's what you do.

01:11.538 --> 01:14.098
You find something that you're
good at and you share it with her.

01:14.207 --> 01:17.335
While you're at it, share it with us too,
huh? And try not to act so desperate.

01:17.444 --> 01:19.344
Oh, my God.
Did I miss a call?

01:19.446 --> 01:21.437
This is Rita.
Just wanted to say hi.

01:21.548 --> 01:24.073
I'm on my way to the train station.
Bye-bye.

01:24.184 --> 01:26.175
She's leaving.
I gotta get over there.

01:26.286 --> 01:30.655
<i>- Michael raced to the station...</i>
- God, is that how I look?

01:30.757 --> 01:32.952
<i>Where Rita was being given her ticket.</i>

01:33.059 --> 01:37.257
Here's your ticket and your instructions.
Call me if you get in over your head.

01:39.299 --> 01:41.824
Hey, hi there, Rita.
Hey! Michael.

01:41.935 --> 01:45.132
Hi. Where are you going,
and how long you going for?

01:46.439 --> 01:48.430
You're right. You-You...
Do not answer that.

01:48.541 --> 01:51.032
- You know, I'm not getting clingy.
- Why are you breathing like that?

01:51.144 --> 01:53.044
I wasn't hurrying to come stop you.

01:53.146 --> 01:55.944
I was out on... for my daily, uh...
Do you run at all?

01:56.049 --> 01:58.813
Oh, yes.
I was in the Olympics once.

01:58.918 --> 02:04.049
- I won a silver medal.
- You're <i>that</i> Rita Leeds? Oh, my goodness!

02:04.157 --> 02:06.785
And a silver medal, yes.
And you came in second.

02:06.893 --> 02:09.759
Now I'm very embarrassed
to be out of breath in front of you.

02:09.863 --> 02:13.299
But you take my breath away.

02:13.399 --> 02:16.493
Oh, Michael.

02:16.603 --> 02:18.230
You're such a !@%$#.

02:20.373 --> 02:22.273
<i>Michael was stunned.</i>

02:22.375 --> 02:25.833
<i>He assumed Rita was using the word
!@%$# in the American sense...</i>

02:25.945 --> 02:28.106
<i>meaning "weak" or "cowardly."</i>

02:28.214 --> 02:30.648
<i>In fact, Rita meant it
in the British sense...</i>

02:30.750 --> 02:33.548
<i>meaning "sweet” or "gentle,"
as in "pussycat."</i>

02:33.653 --> 02:36.781
The Jerries aren't so bad.
They're just being led by a rotten apple.

02:36.890 --> 02:41.827
Oh, Reggie. Fighting for your country,
you're such a pussy.

02:41.928 --> 02:46.558
When I miss your lips, I'll put a
@%$ in my mouth and think of you.

02:46.666 --> 02:49.157
<i>That also had</i>
<i>a different meaning over there.</i>

02:50.803 --> 02:52.998
<i>Michael returned home...</i>

02:53.106 --> 02:55.904
<i>hoping to take solace
in his son's company.</i>

02:56.009 --> 02:58.341
I was thinking you and I should
maybe go play a little catch.

02:58.444 --> 03:00.674
Maybe go for a run.
Do some guy stuff.

03:00.780 --> 03:04.716
- But we're not good at that stuff.
- Yes, I am. We... both are.

03:04.817 --> 03:07.047
<i>Michael and his son had never been...</i>

03:07.153 --> 03:09.678
<i>a very successful athletic team.</i>

03:09.789 --> 03:12.349
<i>In fact, the only thing
George Michael really liked...</i>

03:12.458 --> 03:15.256
<i>was hanging motionless
from the monkey bars...</i>

03:15.361 --> 03:17.852
<i>which the president's counsel
on fitness ranks as...</i>

03:17.964 --> 03:20.228
<i>"slightly easier than the slide."</i>

03:20.333 --> 03:23.962
Anyway, I was just thinking that
maybe we should emphasize athletics...

03:24.070 --> 03:26.470
a little bit more in this family.

03:26.573 --> 03:28.700
I'm gonna start us off
with a protein drink, okay?

03:28.808 --> 03:31.709
Still doing that, huh?

03:31.811 --> 03:35.269
Well, l-I do think we should go
for a run, huh? Some real guy stuff.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.474
I'm supposed to go fabric shopping
with Ann today.

03:37.584 --> 03:40.712
I think we can go butcher.

03:40.820 --> 03:42.788
Uh, uh, no.
We're-We're making a gown.

03:42.889 --> 03:45.824
- She's gonna be in a beauty pageant.
- Yeah. Who's Ann?

03:45.925 --> 03:50.885
My-My girlfriend. She's... You've met her
so many times. You've met her and met her.

03:50.997 --> 03:53.898
I know who Annabelle is. Who's
the Ann that's in the beauty pageant?

03:54.000 --> 03:55.661
That's her. Her name isn't Annabelle.
That's Ann.

03:55.768 --> 03:58.032
No, I know that her name
is not Annabelle. I just...

03:58.137 --> 04:01.231
That's how I remember her name,
'cause her body's kind of shaped like a...

04:01.341 --> 04:05.004
She's the belle of the ball.
What is she doin' in the beauty pageant?

04:05.111 --> 04:07.409
She's... Is she running
the lights or something?

04:07.513 --> 04:09.913
She's in it.
She's a-a contestant.

04:10.016 --> 04:13.076
- Sort of like an inner beauty pageant.
- Ah! There it is.

04:13.186 --> 04:16.120
- Is it like a Christian thing?
- Well, it's half.

04:16.221 --> 04:19.452
It's at the state fair, which this year's
gonna be a church and state fair.

04:19.559 --> 04:22.153
<i>It seems the state had run out of money...</i>

04:22.262 --> 04:24.628
<i>and was going to cancel the fair...</i>

04:24.731 --> 04:27.564
<i>until it was resurrected by this man...</i>

04:27.667 --> 04:29.760
<i>who agreed to cover the fair's costs...</i>

04:29.869 --> 04:31.837
<i>if it included a church presence.</i>

04:31.938 --> 04:35.339
I got some news for you. There's
no such thing as an inner beauty pageant.

04:35.441 --> 04:38.137
They’re just gonna pick the chick
with the best T and A.

04:38.244 --> 04:40.212
<i>As a child, Maeby had been entered...</i>

04:40.313 --> 04:42.406
<i>into a number of progressive pageants...</i>

04:42.515 --> 04:46.815
<i>that claimed to celebrate
beauty in all its forms.</i>

04:46.919 --> 04:49.945
<i>But the winners still tended to have it
going on in the conventional sense.</i>

04:50.056 --> 04:52.456
Remember how badly
you used to want to win?

04:52.558 --> 04:55.026
- No, I remember how badly <i>you</i> used
to want me to win. - We should have...

04:55.128 --> 04:59.531
- I don't know where that hair of yours came from.
- Shameless Plugs on Placentia.

04:59.632 --> 05:03.500
Looks pretty good, huh? And they're
not licensed, which means big savings.

05:04.603 --> 05:07.869
That's been happening a lot lately.

05:07.974 --> 05:11.137
- You know what? This is the perfect thing to do.
- No, Mom, I'm not gonna do it.

05:11.244 --> 05:14.145
No, no, not you.
Bob's daughter Hope.

05:14.247 --> 05:17.045
If I can get Hope this crown...

05:17.150 --> 05:20.642
maybe her father might just wanna
crown me, if you know what I mean.

05:20.753 --> 05:23.745
I'm guessing have sex,
but that's meeting you more than halfway.

05:23.856 --> 05:28.850
Tobias, wanna clean up that mirror?
And the vase?

05:28.961 --> 05:32.260
Perhaps if I could coach a certain
young lady to victory in this pageant...

05:32.365 --> 05:35.232
I can gain back
the respect of my wife.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.895
- I'll show them a little T and A.
- You can't make me do it, Dad.

05:38.004 --> 05:41.337
- Tobias and Ann.
- My Ann?

05:41.441 --> 05:44.001
No, I don't... I don't think
we need any help.

05:44.110 --> 05:46.010
Oh, George Michael, she's a girl.

05:46.112 --> 05:48.945
I need to teach her how to be a woman.
Within her lies a queen.

05:49.048 --> 05:52.347
Let me out that queen.

05:52.452 --> 05:54.044
I think you just did.

05:54.153 --> 05:55.620
- Michael.
- Gob.

05:55.722 --> 05:58.748
Let me get that for you.
Um...

05:58.858 --> 06:03.454
So a young neighborhood tough by the name
of Steve Holt's gonna be here any minute.

06:03.563 --> 06:05.690
- Your son.
- According to him.

06:05.798 --> 06:09.894
- And a DNA test.
- I heard the jury's still out on science.

06:10.002 --> 06:12.027
Anyway, he wants to go to the fair.

06:12.138 --> 06:16.370
But I don't wanna hurt his feelings,
so I need you to do it.

06:16.476 --> 06:19.240
Just tell him that I'm
out of town on one of my trips.

06:19.345 --> 06:23.076
- I'm not gonna lie to your son.
- Come on. I lie to yours all the time.

06:23.182 --> 06:25.082
Michael, I'm not ready to be a dad.

06:25.184 --> 06:28.085
Plus, I'm gonna be very busy this week
being a judge for the pageant.

06:28.187 --> 06:31.452
<i>Gob had been a pageant judge for years.</i>

06:31.557 --> 06:34.651
- You can't believe what it does for your sex life.
- I don't wanna hear it.

06:34.761 --> 06:37.594
I don't wanna say it. First place chick
is hot but has an attitude.

06:37.697 --> 06:41.326
Doesn't date magicians.
Second place is someone weird usually...

06:41.434 --> 06:44.164
like a Chinese girl or a geologist.

06:44.270 --> 06:48.536
But third place, although a little bit plain,
has super low self-esteem.

06:48.641 --> 06:53.408
So I step in and, uh,
lay her crown upon my sweet head.

06:53.513 --> 06:56.607
Have I missed this euphemism?

06:56.716 --> 06:58.684
<i>- Steve Holt!</i>
- I should go.

07:00.553 --> 07:02.987
He's hiding from me, isn't he?

07:03.089 --> 07:06.650
You know, you gotta stop
saying your name all the time.

07:06.759 --> 07:10.422
It's just they have this father-son triathlon,
and I just wanted him to do it with me.

07:10.530 --> 07:12.327
- Mmm.
- Stupid, huh?

07:12.432 --> 07:16.596
- That's a pretty tough race.
- Only for a wimp, a wuss.

07:16.702 --> 07:20.103
- A !@%$#.
<i>- And Steve didn't mean pussycat.</i>

07:20.206 --> 07:24.609
Uh, Steve, how'd you like
to do that triathlon with me?

07:24.710 --> 07:26.109
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

07:26.212 --> 07:28.772
- Uncle Mike!
- Steve Holt!

07:28.881 --> 07:31.543
<i>Both men felt good about themselves.</i>

07:31.651 --> 07:33.551
- Uncle Mike!
- Steve Holt!

07:33.653 --> 07:37.180
<i>But Gob didn't share their enthusiasm.</i>

07:37.290 --> 07:40.817
So this is how Michael
gets rid of my son... by stealing him.

07:40.927 --> 07:43.293
Well, I'll just have
to steal something of his...

07:43.396 --> 07:49.062
like, say, his bicycle,
as a... placeholder.

07:54.207 --> 07:58.803
<i>Michael was trying to prove
his manliness with Steve Holt.</i>

07:58.911 --> 08:01.539
Rita. Hey, it's Michael.
Just wanted to let you know...

08:01.647 --> 08:06.812
that I'm running a triathlon at the fair,
and if you're back in town...

08:06.919 --> 08:08.819
Oh, I can't believe I chose
this moment to call you.

08:08.921 --> 08:11.913
<i>Meanwhile, at the Church and State Fair...</i>

08:12.024 --> 08:15.255
<i>Maeby was trying to enroll
in the pageant... sort of.</i>

08:15.361 --> 08:19.661
Your situation poses a problem.
Let me talk to our chairman.

08:21.434 --> 08:23.595
- Hey, what are you doing, Maeby?
- It's Surely.

08:23.703 --> 08:27.230
I'm just here to prove that
all these pageants care about is looks.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.332
Just watch. Surely's inner beauty
will get trumped by her outer icky.

08:30.443 --> 08:32.842
- What happened to your nose?
- It's part of the disguise.

08:32.945 --> 08:36.278
Isn't it cool? The same one
Nicole Kidman wore in <i>The Hours.</i>

08:36.381 --> 08:40.078
<i>It had been purchased for her at a charity auction
she'd attended as a studio executive...</i>

08:40.186 --> 08:42.177
- $10,000.
<i>- by Jamie Kennedy.</i>

08:42.288 --> 08:44.188
You're such a dear.

08:44.290 --> 08:46.622
But I'm not putting you in my remake
of <i>A Thoroughly Polite Dustup.</i>

08:48.794 --> 08:50.352
Miss Wolfbeak...

08:50.463 --> 08:54.695
although it costs quite a bit
to put in a ramp for you, we got approval.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.563
You're in.

08:56.669 --> 08:58.864
<i>As Maeby found herself
stuck in a beauty pageant...</i>

08:58.971 --> 09:02.532
<i>Lucille was meeting
with attorney Bob Loblaw...</i>

09:02.642 --> 09:05.076
<i>about getting her son
out of the army.</i>

09:05.177 --> 09:07.873
I mean, my God. He's already lost a hand.
If he loses a leg...

09:07.980 --> 09:09.971
how will we ever
get him out of the apartment?

09:10.082 --> 09:13.108
Well, the army does have
a “one in, one out" program...

09:13.219 --> 09:17.121
where the inductee is relieved of duty
once he enlists someone to take his place.

09:17.223 --> 09:20.386
So I'm supposed to find some poor,
innocent soul and hook him?

09:20.493 --> 09:23.394
Well, that's not going to help
sign anyone. Where's your hand?

09:23.496 --> 09:25.464
It got stuck in the prize hole again.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.898
I told you not to play
that stupid game anymore.

09:29.001 --> 09:34.166
- Ow. There goes number three.
<i>- I wasn't playing it.</i>

09:34.273 --> 09:36.207
I was just trying
to get my other one back.

09:36.309 --> 09:38.971
Hi. Sorry, sorry.
I totally forgot about this... meeting.

09:39.078 --> 09:40.978
What's going on?

09:41.080 --> 09:43.742
Your father's gotten a lot of bad press
because of the escape attempts.

09:43.849 --> 09:47.250
- Volunteer for something.
- I'll do anything to get out of this !@%$#% apartment.

09:47.353 --> 09:50.686
You'll do anything to get out of
!@%$#% in this apartment.

09:50.790 --> 09:52.951
- Ah, you're drunk.
- Yeah, Mom, can you just...

09:53.059 --> 09:56.256
And, Dad... You know,
why do we even need the surrogate?

09:56.362 --> 09:59.092
- Dad's in the apartment...
- Don't come in here. Don't come in here.

09:59.198 --> 10:01.462
Don't come in here.
I said not to come in.

10:01.567 --> 10:04.169
- Would you get out here please?
- I'm watching the game.
<i>- I said not to come in!</i>

10:04.270 --> 10:09.105
- I did not spend money on
a surrogate so you can just...
- I lost him.

10:09.208 --> 10:11.506
I think you've got your hands full
trying to make this guy look good.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.205
There's a "Startled Straight"
program at the fair...

10:14.313 --> 10:16.975
which involves you speaking
with at-risk male youth...

10:17.083 --> 10:19.244
to scare them away
from criminal behavior.

10:19.352 --> 10:23.118
Okay. I can do that. I'm gonna need
some big, blown-up photos of your mother.

10:23.222 --> 10:26.157
I think they're talking about
your time in prison, Dad.

10:26.258 --> 10:28.226
Oh. Okay.
Why not?

10:28.327 --> 10:30.955
I mean, uh, if I don't win this thing,
I'm gonna be back there anyway.

10:31.063 --> 10:34.590
"At risk male youth."
That spells "army."

10:34.700 --> 10:37.498
<i>And that's when Buster
discovered a recruiting pool...</i>

10:37.603 --> 10:39.730
<i>the government had been
fishing for years.</i>

10:39.839 --> 10:42.433
- I may head down there too.
- Yeah, I don't know, Dad.

10:42.541 --> 10:44.566
"Startled Straight."
I'm not so sure you're the guy for that.

10:44.677 --> 10:48.010
But I'll look into it while I'm down
at the fair signing up for a triathlon.

10:48.114 --> 10:50.378
Triathlon?
Do you know how hard a triathlon is?

10:50.483 --> 10:55.079
People lose control of every bodily function.
Didn't you ever see that video?

10:55.187 --> 10:58.486
It's like your mother
on New Year's Eve.

10:58.591 --> 11:01.526
<i>Actually, Lucille went down faster.</i>

11:03.262 --> 11:07.164
You're not even in shape. You're gonna
fall apart in front of everybody.

11:07.266 --> 11:09.564
- You're kind of scaring me, Dad.
- You see?

11:09.669 --> 11:13.036
Perfect for this "Startled Straight" thing.

11:13.139 --> 11:15.232
<i>Tobias was getting Ann ready...</i>

11:15.341 --> 11:17.832
<i>for the talent portion of the pageant.</i>

11:17.943 --> 11:20.673
I think we need something
with a little more spectacle in the act.

11:20.780 --> 11:23.613
Something that will make you
look small and pretty in comparison.

11:23.716 --> 11:27.516
- A camel.
- You know, she has a really lovely singing voice.

11:27.620 --> 11:29.588
I'll sing to the camel.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.385
Yes. We can Google some disco songs
with the word "hump" in them.

11:32.491 --> 11:34.618
- Cute.
- No, that sounds a bit racy.

11:34.727 --> 11:38.060
Okay. He may be afraid of sex,
but you're not going to win without it.

11:38.164 --> 11:40.189
- No, I'm not afraid of sex.
- Oh, good.

11:40.299 --> 11:43.291
Go have sex with this girl right now.
Do it. Go.

11:43.402 --> 11:47.133
Get in there, have some
sex with her right now.

11:47.239 --> 11:50.072
I didn't think so.
Ann, you need to decide...

11:50.176 --> 11:53.634
whether you want
a man or a boy.

11:53.746 --> 11:57.204
- I know how I'd answer.
- Give us some room, George Michael.

11:57.316 --> 12:01.719
- I can't breathe.
- Okay, now you're upsetting the talent. Out!

12:06.225 --> 12:10.628
<i>Michael, meanwhile, had begun
training for the triathlon...</i>

12:10.730 --> 12:13.164
<i>to keep from humiliating himself
in front of Rita.</i>

12:13.265 --> 12:16.291
Don't ask, "Can I?"
Ask, "I can!"

12:16.402 --> 12:18.302
You can control your bladder
when you're dead.

12:18.404 --> 12:22.033
No blood, no oil.
There's no "I" in win!

12:31.016 --> 12:33.951
<i>Michael returned confident
in his manliness...</i>

12:34.053 --> 12:37.386
<i>when he ran into his son,
who was questioning his own.</i>

12:37.490 --> 12:39.549
How is that pageant going?

12:39.658 --> 12:43.526
- It turns out Ann doesn't want
me around during it. - Really?

12:43.629 --> 12:46.291
Well, now you and me can go to
that fair together tomorrow after all.

12:46.398 --> 12:49.424
- Yeah? - Yeah, and maybe
do some man stuff like you said.

12:49.535 --> 12:52.698
Actually, I've already signed up
for the father-son triathlon.

12:52.805 --> 12:55.103
Oh. Okay, great. Yeah.
I did wanna do that with you.

12:55.207 --> 12:58.199
I mean, I've already promised Steve Holt.

12:58.310 --> 13:01.711
- You know, he's older. It's more manly.
- You don't think I'm manly?

13:01.814 --> 13:04.510
No, no, it's just, uh...

13:04.617 --> 13:07.279
Darn that Annabelle!
She ruins everything.

13:07.386 --> 13:09.786
<i>But the next morning, Michael awoke...</i>

13:09.889 --> 13:15.020
<i>to discover every muscle in his body
was exacting revenge.</i>

13:15.127 --> 13:17.652
- Oil?
<i>- And so was his brother Gob.</i>

13:21.000 --> 13:24.629
Hey, does anyone know
why my handlebars are in my bed?

13:28.607 --> 13:31.872
<i>The Church and State Fair
was in full swing.</i>

13:38.851 --> 13:41.820
<i>And Lindsay watched with pride as Hope Loblaw...</i>

13:41.921 --> 13:44.981
<i>Did an original number
that Lindsay herself had written.</i>

13:51.163 --> 13:53.825
And now, please welcome
Annabelle Veal...

13:53.933 --> 13:58.165
performing "We Three Kings"
with a camel tow.

14:03.676 --> 14:07.612
<i>Michael arrived at the fair
sore from overtraining.</i>

14:07.713 --> 14:09.874
Can't really go that high.
I'm in a lot of pain here.

14:09.982 --> 14:12.143
Yeah, you know, I figured
you'd be that way.

14:12.251 --> 14:15.049
So, uh, Coach gave me these.
They're, uh, pills filled with oxygen.

14:15.154 --> 14:17.054
- Yeah?
- And they keep you from being incontinent.

14:17.156 --> 14:19.056
Have one.
They're called oxy-incontinent.

14:19.158 --> 14:21.558
<i>Steve didn't have that quite right.</i>

14:21.660 --> 14:25.426
<i>But Michael thought Rita might be coming,
and he was desperate to impress her.</i>

14:25.531 --> 14:28.898
<i>Meanwhile, Maeby was trying
to get knocked out of the pageant.</i>

14:29.001 --> 14:33.233
Pope impersonator, Church.
How has God influenced your life?

14:33.339 --> 14:36.638
About just as much as Big Bird
and the Keebler elves.

14:36.742 --> 14:42.078
Well, my faith would have been shaken
if he had taken my legs too.

14:42.181 --> 14:45.582
Uh, Gob Bluth, State.

14:45.684 --> 14:48.949
I was betrayed
by my brother Michael.

14:49.054 --> 14:51.284
Who's your favorite
family member and why?

14:51.390 --> 14:55.383
Definitely not my shallow, materialistic
mother, who only cares about looks.

14:55.494 --> 14:59.555
I think we all feel that way about
our mothers. And we all have legs.

15:05.037 --> 15:08.700
<i>Meanwhile, George Sr. arrived
at the Startled Straight tent.</i>

15:08.807 --> 15:10.832
I'll be waiting out here
with my enlistment forms.

15:10.943 --> 15:14.743
So go in there and scare them
right into my open arm!

15:14.847 --> 15:19.841
<i>But as it turns out, the fair
had two Startled Straight tents...</i>

15:19.952 --> 15:23.080
<i>and George Sr. Had wandered
into the church-sponsored one...</i>

15:23.188 --> 15:24.917
You wanna be some guy's girlfriend?

15:25.024 --> 15:29.461
<i>Intended to scare gay young men
into a heterosexual lifestyle.</i>

15:29.561 --> 15:32.291
You wanna have some guy reach around you
in the middle of the night...

15:32.398 --> 15:33.990
- start messing with your junk?
- Is he ugly?

15:34.099 --> 15:37.466
No, it's pitch-black.
You don't... You don't see him.

15:37.569 --> 15:40.163
It never stops, guys...

15:40.272 --> 15:42.365
and everybody acts like
it's no big deal.

15:42.474 --> 15:45.102
Is there a cover charge?

15:45.210 --> 15:47.838
<i>And the inner beauty pageant
was down to the final three.</i>

15:47.947 --> 15:51.144
Will it be
the beautiful Hope Loblaw...

15:51.250 --> 15:54.276
the stalwart Annabelle Veal...

15:54.386 --> 15:58.379
or the justifiably bitter
Surely Wolfbeak?

15:58.490 --> 16:02.984
<i>It became clear that
Surely was going to win.</i>

16:03.095 --> 16:05.461
I'm sorry.
This is wrong.

16:05.564 --> 16:09.022
<i>And that's when Maeby
displayed some real inner beauty.</i>

16:09.134 --> 16:11.364
One of these girls deserves to win.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.062
<i>She can stand!</i>

16:13.172 --> 16:17.370
- Maeby?
- That's how I know her.

16:17.476 --> 16:20.639
- Let us pray.
- Oh, for God's sake.

16:20.746 --> 16:22.839
Praise the Lord!

16:22.948 --> 16:25.542
<i>And Michael, now feeling a little woozy...</i>

16:25.651 --> 16:27.710
<i>arrived to see the triathlon course...</i>

16:27.820 --> 16:31.984
<i>which consisted of several tricycles,
five inflatable pools...</i>

16:32.091 --> 16:35.390
- What the hell is this?
<i>- and fathers and sons being manacled together.</i>

16:35.494 --> 16:38.657
Don't let it psyche you out.
Did that oxy-incontinent set in yet?

16:38.764 --> 16:40.994
You knew this is what
the race was?

16:41.100 --> 16:44.934
Kind of. I mean, they change it every year
so you can't replicate it on your lawn.

16:45.037 --> 16:47.164
Why did you let me
train so hard?

16:47.272 --> 16:50.605
- I just thought you wanted to hang out
and do guy stuff. - This isn't guy stuff.

16:50.709 --> 16:55.043
I don't know why I thought that
you'd wanna do this. This is stupid, huh?

16:55.147 --> 16:58.014
No, Steve, Steve.
You're not going anywhere.

16:58.117 --> 17:00.551
- You'll do it with me?
- We're chained together.

17:00.652 --> 17:03.883
But, you know, Rita's not here yet,
and what the hell. Let's go win this thing.

17:03.989 --> 17:06.549
- Let's win this thing!
- What the hell.

17:06.657 --> 17:09.718
- What the hell!
- Let's win this thing. Let's go ahead and start up.

17:09.828 --> 17:13.229
<i>And after the pageant,
George Michael went to congratulate Ann.</i>

17:13.332 --> 17:16.028
Congratulations on coming in third.
That's amazing.

17:16.135 --> 17:18.398
And I heard you're the first camel act
to ever crack the top 10 too...

17:18.503 --> 17:20.404
so that's, like, a record.

17:20.506 --> 17:24.339
And I'm a bit relieved,
because, um, I was...

17:24.443 --> 17:26.877
I thought maybe if you came in first,
you would have outgrown me.

17:26.979 --> 17:29.573
- Outgrown you.
- Mm-hmm.

17:29.681 --> 17:31.205
That is the term
I've been looking for.

17:31.316 --> 17:33.216
<i>It seems Gob was right...</i>

17:33.318 --> 17:36.116
<i>about what happens
to third place contestants.</i>

17:36.221 --> 17:37.711
I met a man.

17:37.823 --> 17:39.916
<i>George Michael was devastated.</i>

17:40.025 --> 17:44.792
<i>It seemed he'd lost his girl and
his father because he wasn't man enough.</i>

17:44.897 --> 17:47.627
<i>And he was faced with a choice.</i>

18:02.881 --> 18:07.909
<i>Michael and Steve Holt
finished their triathlon in first place.</i>

18:08.020 --> 18:09.920
<i>Of course, they were way older.</i>

18:10.022 --> 18:12.320
Believe it or not,
that took about everything I got.

18:12.424 --> 18:14.449
I don't know what was in that pill,
but I do not feel so great.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.687
- It's gonna get a little worse
before it gets any better. - Really?

18:16.795 --> 18:18.092
- We won!
- Okay.

18:18.197 --> 18:19.596
- Hey, possible nephew.
- Oh, hey.

18:19.698 --> 18:21.598
Michael, your son's
signing up for the army.

18:21.700 --> 18:23.600
What? You signed him up
for the army?

18:23.702 --> 18:25.636
Oh, my God, you're right.
If he goes in, I can get out.

18:25.737 --> 18:27.762
- I've gotta get my name on his form.
- Hang on! Hey!

18:27.873 --> 18:30.341
I gotta get there.
I gotta stop this.

18:30.442 --> 18:32.637
Hey, you gotta do this with me.
Come on.

18:32.744 --> 18:35.508
<i>And that's when Rita noticed Michael.</i>

18:35.614 --> 18:38.105
Wait for me. Wait for me.

18:38.217 --> 18:40.117
- Michael?
- Hey.

18:40.219 --> 18:43.211
- Could you not finish?
- No, no. First place.

18:43.322 --> 18:45.483
First place, I swear.
But I'm sorry, I gotta go do something.

18:45.591 --> 18:47.616
- Wait, I'm dizzy.
- Uncle Mike, come on.

18:47.726 --> 18:50.024
- I'll-I'll take you.
- No, no, no, no. Steve, Steve...

18:50.129 --> 18:52.063
Let's go. Come on.
Come on.

18:52.164 --> 18:54.564
<i>And meanwhile, George Sr...</i>

18:54.666 --> 18:58.329
<i>hadn't succeeded in
startling anyone but himself.</i>

18:58.437 --> 19:02.965
I mean, there's nothing to do all day
except lift weights and fold laundry...

19:03.075 --> 19:06.306
get thrown into a cage
with a bunch of sweaty men.

19:06.411 --> 19:10.040
Excuse me.
I can't go back.

19:10.149 --> 19:13.175
- I can't go back.
- I'm glad he won't be there. He's ugly.

19:13.285 --> 19:17.415
<i>George Sr. Came across
a U.S. Army combat Humvee...</i>

19:17.523 --> 19:19.423
<i>and the pope mobile...</i>

19:19.525 --> 19:22.426
<i>and he decided to escape
in the bulletproof one.</i>

19:24.129 --> 19:27.565
Come on.
I can't go back!

19:27.666 --> 19:30.863
<i>- And Michael caught up with George Michael...</i>
- What are you doing?

19:30.969 --> 19:33.494
<i>Who was three rungs away
from being in the army.</i>

19:33.605 --> 19:35.698
I'm becoming a man, Dad.
Isn't that what everybody wants?

19:35.807 --> 19:38.571
Of course not. Gob, can you get us
out of these chains, please?

19:38.677 --> 19:41.737
Oh, so you steal my son,
and now you need me to save yours.

19:41.847 --> 19:45.010
- All right, one key coming up.
- He's a magician.

19:45.117 --> 19:46.880
Yeah. We-We need you
to sign this form.

19:46.985 --> 19:48.850
No, it's good, Dad.

19:48.954 --> 19:51.388
There's all sorts of benefits,
and it's like a family.

19:51.490 --> 19:55.551
But it's also an army of one,
and it's no place for wimps.

19:55.661 --> 19:59.688
You have a family, okay?
And I'm the wimp, not you.

19:59.798 --> 20:03.427
Because I could not take
you being away in the army, all right?

20:03.535 --> 20:06.197
I love you.

20:07.305 --> 20:10.969
- That did it.
- He's not signing up.

20:11.076 --> 20:13.772
That's too bad.
I was this close to gettin' out.

20:13.879 --> 20:16.404
Hey, I think I'm gonna go get
one of those corn dog crosses.

20:16.515 --> 20:19.712
- With all the "crucifixins"? All right.
- Thanks, Dad.

20:26.491 --> 20:29.289
- Was that your son?
- Yes, Rita.

20:29.394 --> 20:31.954
Yeah. The most important person
in the world to me.

20:32.064 --> 20:35.761
You really are quite a man, Michael.

20:35.867 --> 20:37.835
- Do you really think so?
- Oh, yes.

20:37.936 --> 20:41.235
You're a complete and utter !@%$#.

20:45.043 --> 20:48.012
<i>I can't believe we had to bleep that.</i>

20:48.113 --> 20:50.013
<i>It would have been
such a nice moment.</i>

20:51.350 --> 20:53.318
<i>On the next</i>
Arrested Development.

20:53.418 --> 20:56.444
<i>Buster signs Steve Holt up
for the army.</i>

20:56.555 --> 21:00.491
No, no, you can't. You can't.
I'm finally ready to be a father to you.

21:00.592 --> 21:03.755
- I know that now.
- I don't go in for another two years.

21:03.862 --> 21:06.956
Well, as your father,
can I sign something?

21:07.065 --> 21:08.965
<i>And George Sr. Finds out...</i>

21:09.067 --> 21:11.035
<i>- that a fake pope mobile...</i>
- I'll see you in hell!

21:14.206 --> 21:16.299
<i>...can't stop real bullets.</i>

21:16.408 --> 21:19.172
Thank God I wasn't in the Humvee.
