WEBVTT

00:01.366 --> 00:03.847
Hello, family. Look, y'all, tonight

00:03.848 --> 00:05.816
is a very special episode
of the Rel show.

00:05.817 --> 00:07.651
Oh, if you don't know,
I'm Lil Rel Howery,

00:07.652 --> 00:09.887
star of the Rel show.

00:09.888 --> 00:12.508
And tonight we got a special
Halloween episode for you.

00:12.509 --> 00:14.943
As you know, I'm on Sunday
nights with all these cartoons,

00:14.943 --> 00:18.013
and they do all these
amazing Halloween episodes.

00:18.014 --> 00:21.583
So tonight, we decided to do
our very own Halloween episode.

00:21.584 --> 00:24.086
That's right. It's gonna be crazy.

00:24.087 --> 00:25.988
I mean, it's a good chance
it might end my career,

00:25.989 --> 00:28.657
but... shibbity
dobos, it is what it is.

00:28.658 --> 00:31.260
So, enjoy.

00:35.732 --> 00:38.300
All right, look, look,
I'm really excited about this.

00:38.301 --> 00:40.502
I heard this movie is
the best black Halloween movie

00:40.503 --> 00:42.404
since Blacula. I mean,

00:42.405 --> 00:44.807
the bar is set pretty low,
but it's supposed to be great.

00:44.808 --> 00:46.108
Yeah, critics are calling this

00:46.109 --> 00:47.676
the feel-woke movie of the year.

00:47.677 --> 00:50.779
Look, y'all, I'm excited,
but it is a lot of hype.

00:50.780 --> 00:51.914
Okay, come on now.

00:51.915 --> 00:53.282
This is a young, black filmmaker

00:53.283 --> 00:55.451
and he made the wokest movie
of the year.

00:55.452 --> 00:56.885
The hype is justified.

00:56.886 --> 00:59.822
Look, I'm just saying
I don't like too much hype.

00:59.823 --> 01:02.124
I been overhyped before.

01:02.125 --> 01:04.593
Listen, we got to support
all things black, all right?

01:04.593 --> 01:05.794
I love everything black.

01:05.795 --> 01:07.262
My favorite fish? Blackened.

01:07.263 --> 01:09.798
My favorite horse? Black Beauty.

01:09.799 --> 01:12.334
My favorite white actor? Jack Black.

01:12.335 --> 01:15.404
And see, Dad, that's what
I'm talking about.

01:15.405 --> 01:17.239
That is why we got to support
what this moment is.

01:17.240 --> 01:19.675
This is black excellence at its best.

01:19.676 --> 01:21.977
Look what I did, right?
I got the blackest snacks

01:21.978 --> 01:24.012
you could think of to celebrate that.

01:24.013 --> 01:25.614
Look, I even got black licorice.

01:25.615 --> 01:27.015
I mean, even though it's disgusting...

01:27.016 --> 01:28.383
- Mm-hmm.
- ...still black.

01:28.384 --> 01:30.686
Black is beautiful.

01:33.022 --> 01:36.225
But this still nasty.

01:36.226 --> 01:38.961
But look, let's get to this movie.

01:45.468 --> 01:49.404
Dear diary,
it is I, Frederick Douglass.

01:49.405 --> 01:53.175
Just when I thought this world
was as evil as it could be,

01:53.176 --> 01:55.644
it has once again proven
that its depravity

01:55.645 --> 01:59.181
far exceeds my wildest expectations.

01:59.182 --> 02:01.683
With abolitionists afoot in the South,

02:01.684 --> 02:03.118
the southern plantation owners

02:03.119 --> 02:06.455
begin to fear life without slavery.

02:06.456 --> 02:08.991
Oh, God. Another slave movie.

02:08.991 --> 02:10.192
Oh, Brittany, calm down.

02:10.193 --> 02:11.727
You know Kanye said
slavery was a choice.

02:11.728 --> 02:14.997
They made that choice so we have
great movies like this.

02:14.998 --> 02:17.566
Look, Brittany, slavery is emotional.

02:17.567 --> 02:19.001
You know what I mean?

02:19.002 --> 02:22.170
They are stories of-of triumph
over adversity.

02:22.171 --> 02:24.137
Yeah, and it ain't just slavery,
either. Know what I'm saying?

02:24.138 --> 02:25.514
We do have great segregation films

02:25.515 --> 02:27.716
and amazing jail movies.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.074

02:41.331 --> 02:43.933
Oh!

02:45.535 --> 02:47.203
There's only one thing

02:47.204 --> 02:49.238
I know for certain:

02:49.239 --> 02:51.907
all humans are created equal,

02:51.908 --> 02:55.511
but all zombies deserve to die.

02:56.913 --> 02:59.315
Damn.

02:59.316 --> 03:01.650
All right, all right,
I ain't see that coming.

03:13.897 --> 03:16.132
I always thought that
you can improve any movie

03:16.133 --> 03:17.867
by adding zombies.

03:17.868 --> 03:19.835
You know something, that's
a great point, little brother.

03:19.836 --> 03:22.738
I mean if Snakes on a Plane
was Zombies on a Plane,

03:22.739 --> 03:26.075
man, Samuel L. Jackson
would've got an Oscar, man.

03:26.076 --> 03:29.345
Fearing slavery would cease to exist,

03:29.346 --> 03:32.048
the Southern states attempted
to create a free labor force

03:32.049 --> 03:35.484
of the undead, but the South
did not realize that zombies

03:35.485 --> 03:36.986
could not be controlled.

03:36.987 --> 03:39.722
They have now overrun our nation

03:39.723 --> 03:41.390
and I'm traveling
to the one safe place

03:41.391 --> 03:42.691
left in this country,

03:42.692 --> 03:44.794
a land so green, so peaceful,

03:44.795 --> 03:47.363
with rivers of milk and honey:

03:47.364 --> 03:50.399
the West Side of Chicago.

03:50.400 --> 03:53.235
Oh, oh, okay, man. Now he
trying to go to the crib, too.

03:53.236 --> 03:54.870
Okay.

03:54.871 --> 03:57.606
Yeah, finally Chicago being
represented in a positive light.

03:57.607 --> 03:59.275
All right, look, I was wrong.

03:59.276 --> 04:01.577
He repping the city,
he killing zombies,

04:01.578 --> 04:03.212
I can't even be mad at him.

04:03.213 --> 04:05.815
Look, Chicago ain't look
this cool since Cooley High.

04:05.816 --> 04:07.750
And, look, did y'all catch
the symbolism, too?

04:07.751 --> 04:09.819
Like, look, the pen
turns into a dagger.

04:09.820 --> 04:12.388
It just symbolizes
how strong words are.

04:12.389 --> 04:13.722
I'm woke.

04:13.723 --> 04:16.158
Yeah, I don't know about that.

04:29.439 --> 04:31.540
Oh, no!

04:31.541 --> 04:33.109
Frederick, don't go out that door!

04:33.110 --> 04:35.844
Oh, nothing good
rustles in bushes. Man.

04:37.647 --> 04:39.248
Reveal yourselves as humans

04:39.249 --> 04:42.084
or I'll kill you
as the undead creatures you are

04:47.457 --> 04:48.858
Who are you?

04:48.859 --> 04:51.494
Harriet. Harriet Tubman.

04:51.495 --> 04:53.529
Oh, they got my girl Harriet
in this movie?

04:53.530 --> 04:57.133
That's what I'm talking about.
Black girl magic.

04:57.134 --> 05:00.169
The greatest conductor
of the Underground Railroad.

05:00.170 --> 05:03.239
Some folk call me Moses. Who are you?

05:03.240 --> 05:04.773
I'm Frederick.

05:04.774 --> 05:08.444
Frederick Douglass.

05:08.445 --> 05:09.879
Ms. Tubman, your...

05:09.880 --> 05:12.715
your name precedes you.

05:12.716 --> 05:16.485
I've always looked
forward to look you...

05:16.486 --> 05:18.687
look you in your eyes.

05:18.688 --> 05:22.591
Oh, my God. You are way,
way more beautiful

05:22.592 --> 05:25.261
than I could have ever imagined.

05:25.262 --> 05:28.097
You're not so bad yourself.

05:29.466 --> 05:33.369
It was love at first sight.

06:04.801 --> 06:06.035
All right,

06:06.036 --> 06:07.970
what the hell is this?

06:07.971 --> 06:09.605
Oh, come on, Brittany, don't start.

06:09.606 --> 06:12.474
Don't start what?
They sexualizing Harriet Tubman.

06:12.475 --> 06:13.943
So I'm-a start, Rel.

06:13.944 --> 06:16.278
Look, I know I said support
all things black,

06:16.279 --> 06:18.981
but I'm kind of uncomfortable

06:18.982 --> 06:21.383
sitting here watching
this sex scene with my kids,

06:21.384 --> 06:23.085
especially between
two historical black figures.

06:23.086 --> 06:25.421
That's nasty, man.

06:25.422 --> 06:27.056
Hold on, okay?

06:27.057 --> 06:29.225
Do y'all hear how unwoke y'all sound?

06:29.226 --> 06:30.759
Look, Brittany,
you act like Harriet Tubman

06:30.760 --> 06:31.927
can't be a sex symbol.

06:31.928 --> 06:34.163
Okay? She freed a bunch of people.

06:34.164 --> 06:36.765
I tell you, the sexiest thing
a woman can do for me

06:36.766 --> 06:39.101
if I was a slave is free me.

06:39.102 --> 06:41.003
And Frederick Douglass, guys...

06:41.004 --> 06:43.038
one of the smartest black men
of all time.

06:43.039 --> 06:45.908
Taught himself how to read and write.

06:45.909 --> 06:47.209
I don't know how you do that,

06:47.210 --> 06:48.711
but hey, that's besides the point.

06:48.712 --> 06:49.712
It's progressive.

06:49.713 --> 06:51.380
Exactly. Woke.

06:51.381 --> 06:54.283
Listen, I'm all for Harriet
being sexually empowered,

06:54.284 --> 06:56.151
but that scene was disgusting, Rel.

06:56.152 --> 06:59.154
Okay, look, it's
cinematic license, right?

06:59.155 --> 07:01.890
Tarantino killed Hitler
in a movie theater.

07:01.891 --> 07:03.425
Look, in Moonlight,

07:03.426 --> 07:05.694
you got three different people
playing the same guy

07:05.695 --> 07:07.229
and none of 'em look alike.

07:07.230 --> 07:09.198
Robert Downey Jr. played blackface

07:09.199 --> 07:10.733
and almost got a BET Award.

07:10.734 --> 07:13.002
Come on, y'all, let's just see
where this goes.

07:13.003 --> 07:15.004
Yo, I-I did like Tropic Thunder.

07:15.005 --> 07:17.072
You win.

07:17.073 --> 07:18.874
Okay. See?

07:18.875 --> 07:20.876
Now back to the lovemaking.

07:27.550 --> 07:30.486
The only other thing
that has brought me more joy

07:30.487 --> 07:32.087
is freedom.

07:32.088 --> 07:34.556
Same.

07:38.928 --> 07:40.396
Mmm.

07:40.397 --> 07:42.831
Ms. Tubman, you season
one fine squirrel.

07:42.832 --> 07:45.501
Well, I just followed
the directions on the box.

07:47.737 --> 07:49.938
So, uh...

07:49.939 --> 07:51.473
the children, are they, uh...?

07:51.474 --> 07:54.510
Oh, they're not mine,
if that's what you're asking.

07:54.511 --> 07:57.012
See, she was given to me
by her mother,

07:57.013 --> 08:00.916
who was bit by a zombie, and I
promised to protect the girl.

08:00.917 --> 08:04.753
Then she brutally murdered
my mother in front of me,

08:04.754 --> 08:06.088
but we're cool.

08:06.089 --> 08:07.556
What about the boy?

08:07.557 --> 08:10.559
I don't know. He doesn't speak.

08:10.560 --> 08:13.329
I found him in an abandoned
bush near Wichita.

08:13.330 --> 08:14.963
So, amid all this turmoil,

08:14.964 --> 08:16.398
where is your destination?

08:16.399 --> 08:17.733
The West Side of Chicago.

08:17.734 --> 08:20.235
That's mine, too.

08:20.236 --> 08:22.304
- Really?
- Oh, yes,

08:22.305 --> 08:24.406
the West Side of Chicago.

08:24.407 --> 08:26.809
Oh, I hear it's like heaven on Earth.

08:26.810 --> 08:28.777
They got pastoral landscapes

08:28.778 --> 08:31.947
and fertile soil...

08:31.948 --> 08:34.515
and zero zombie violence.

08:35.684 --> 08:38.020
Well, I'd love to go there with you.

08:40.123 --> 08:42.957
It seems as fate
has brought us together.

08:42.958 --> 08:45.060
Before we travel, there's something

08:45.061 --> 08:46.729
you must know about me.

08:46.730 --> 08:49.732
I sometimes suffer
from fainting spells.

08:49.733 --> 08:52.634
Good to know.

08:52.635 --> 08:56.438
When you're with me, you'll
always feel protected.

09:04.781 --> 09:07.282
Now, that's some odd behavior
for a zombie.

09:07.283 --> 09:09.651
That's odd behavior
for a zombie, right?

09:09.652 --> 09:11.453
Told you.

09:11.454 --> 09:14.123
Yeah. Let's check it out.

09:14.124 --> 09:16.758
Kids, stay close.

09:18.828 --> 09:20.996
Thank you for joining me this evening.

09:20.997 --> 09:23.499
I know you think we have nothing
in common, but like you,

09:23.500 --> 09:25.467
I was lost in the wilderness,

09:25.468 --> 09:27.503
trying to feed my soul.

09:27.504 --> 09:30.205
Before you try to eat me,
I want you to think.

09:30.206 --> 09:32.007
Think about who you are.

09:32.008 --> 09:35.210
'Cause you can, you know.

09:35.211 --> 09:37.579
You have a brain.

09:37.580 --> 09:39.148
My zombie brothers and sisters,

09:39.149 --> 09:41.750
I am... Malcolm X.

09:41.751 --> 09:44.887
Just when I thought this movie
couldn't get better, it does.

09:44.888 --> 09:46.588
Black excellence.

09:46.589 --> 09:50.225
I totally changed my life,
and you can do the same thing.

09:50.226 --> 09:52.795
Okay, I'm really doing my best,

09:52.796 --> 09:55.731
but what the hell is Malcolm X
doing in 1855?

09:55.732 --> 09:57.433
You can't just remix history.

09:57.434 --> 09:59.067
Why can't you, Brittany?

09:59.068 --> 10:00.903
Look, open your mind.

10:00.904 --> 10:02.571
What if the filmmaker's trying to say

10:02.572 --> 10:05.207
that the struggle transcends time?

10:05.208 --> 10:06.608
Come on, now.

10:06.609 --> 10:08.544
Malcolm X looking good.

10:12.036 --> 10:15.936
Okay, I just want to point out
99% of these great reviews

10:15.962 --> 10:17.495
are written by white people.

10:17.496 --> 10:20.265
I don't trust white people
reviewing black stuff.

10:20.266 --> 10:22.434
I mean, the simple,
unfortunate reality is

10:22.435 --> 10:24.169
most critics are white.

10:24.170 --> 10:26.504
But there's nothing we can do
about that but to stay woke.

10:26.505 --> 10:29.374
- Boy, if you say "woke" one more time...
- O-Okay, hey, hey.

10:29.375 --> 10:30.709
Look at yourselves.

10:30.710 --> 10:32.811
I know you're dead,

10:32.812 --> 10:35.780
but there's no reason to walk
around looking like this.

10:35.781 --> 10:37.382
Just because you're ghostly

10:37.383 --> 10:39.117
doesn't mean you have to be ghastly.

10:39.118 --> 10:40.952
Walking around with clothes

10:40.953 --> 10:42.954
all torn and tattered.
Look at you, sister.

10:42.955 --> 10:45.457
Have some pride in yourself.

10:45.458 --> 10:47.359
I press upon you

10:47.360 --> 10:50.762
to unify, to reform yourself, morally.

10:50.763 --> 10:54.199
You got to quit getting drunk.
You got to quit doing drugs.

10:54.200 --> 10:57.235
You got to quit fornicating
and doing adultery,

10:57.236 --> 10:59.304
if there is a thing like zombie sex.

11:00.773 --> 11:02.007
Stop it.

11:02.008 --> 11:04.142
We are not your enemy.

11:04.143 --> 11:07.212
Look, I love hearing Malcolm X speak,

11:07.213 --> 11:09.114
but what is he even saying?

11:09.115 --> 11:11.950
Zombies don't drink, take drugs,

11:11.951 --> 11:14.119
or have sex. And then, hold up...

11:14.120 --> 11:17.055
are the zombies black or white?
Like, who's the enemy?

11:17.056 --> 11:19.658
Okay, maybe what he's trying to say is

11:19.659 --> 11:23.361
that when you become the undead,
there is no race.

11:23.362 --> 11:26.731
You know, like,
racism is man-made anyway,

11:26.732 --> 11:28.767
and it's used to control people.

11:28.768 --> 11:31.603
So he's using zombies

11:31.604 --> 11:33.738
to teach us about humanity.

11:33.739 --> 11:35.774
Oh, that's deep.

11:35.775 --> 11:37.409
Why do you eat the black man?

11:37.410 --> 11:39.377
Look, your body's already torn up.

11:39.378 --> 11:42.247
Black men are full of sodium
and pork and sugar.

11:42.248 --> 11:43.848
You know what that does
to a zombie body?

11:43.849 --> 11:45.617
You're already falling apart.

11:45.618 --> 11:49.454
I implore upon you to wake up
and join us in the fight.

11:49.455 --> 11:53.124
Do not eat us. Eat the enemy,

11:53.125 --> 11:55.961
by any means necessary.

12:24.423 --> 12:28.426
Why? I had them.
They were about to change.

12:32.999 --> 12:34.466
Sorry, brother zombie.

12:34.467 --> 12:38.803
Had to hit him with my
Malcolm X-ray glasses.

12:38.804 --> 12:40.839
God.

12:40.840 --> 12:43.074
Malcolm X is the original X-Man.

12:47.747 --> 12:49.247
No!

12:58.824 --> 13:00.758
No!

13:11.003 --> 13:13.238
That boy is the truth.

13:13.239 --> 13:15.273
Oh, my God. Yo, the zombie just died

13:15.274 --> 13:18.143
from biting the kid.
Yo, he's zombie poison.

13:18.144 --> 13:20.445
Malcolm's right,
that boy is the truth.

13:24.083 --> 13:26.684
Look, we didn't land on this moment,

13:26.685 --> 13:28.620
this moment landed on us.

13:28.621 --> 13:31.556
It's imperative that we take
that boy to see a scientist.

13:31.557 --> 13:34.826
I'm not trusting some crazed
scientist with this boy's life.

13:34.827 --> 13:36.161
We don't even know you.

13:36.162 --> 13:37.896
Crazed scientist.

13:37.897 --> 13:39.764
Give me your jelly sandwiches.

13:42.835 --> 13:45.336
When will black folks learn
to trust one another?

13:45.337 --> 13:48.239
Mmm. Oh, my God.

13:48.240 --> 13:49.930
This sandwich is now
perfectly balanced.

13:49.931 --> 13:50.975
I don't know what this

13:50.976 --> 13:53.511
very strange but tasteful
concoction is. What is it?

13:53.512 --> 13:55.880
He calls it "peanut butter."

13:55.881 --> 13:58.183
Now, if George Washington Carver

13:58.184 --> 13:59.751
can do that with a peanut,

13:59.752 --> 14:02.520
think what he can do
with this mute boy.

14:02.521 --> 14:04.522
See, that's what I'm talking
about. It's about time

14:04.523 --> 14:06.791
they gave George Washington
Carver his due as a scientist.

14:06.792 --> 14:09.294
Most of the time he gets reduced
to facts about peanuts

14:09.295 --> 14:11.129
during Black History Month.

14:11.130 --> 14:13.898
My brother and sister,
I know it's been a long trip.

14:13.899 --> 14:17.035
It's a long and hard road
to George Washington Carver,

14:17.036 --> 14:19.170
and we have to be prepared.

14:19.171 --> 14:21.639
This store sells
a camouflage of sorts,

14:21.640 --> 14:23.741
a purple haze that will momentarily

14:23.742 --> 14:25.210
repel a zombie.

14:25.211 --> 14:26.678
Skrrrt, skrrt!

14:26.679 --> 14:28.012
- He's turned
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:28.013 --> 14:29.481
Relax, shorty.

14:29.482 --> 14:31.182
I'm not a zombie,
I just move a little slow,

14:31.183 --> 14:33.518
you know what I'm saying?
I'm Offset from the Migos.

14:34.653 --> 14:37.222
Hippy hop, hippy hip.

14:37.223 --> 14:39.190
And you know I got a hip. Hey.

14:39.191 --> 14:40.892
People want it on the tip. Hey.

14:40.893 --> 14:43.661
Hey.

14:48.267 --> 14:50.034
Hey, Dad, what are you doing?
What happened?

14:50.035 --> 14:52.637
Man, this is ridiculous.
Where's Martin Luther King?

14:52.638 --> 14:55.140
He's the only black man
with his own holiday.

14:55.141 --> 14:56.741
I mean, where's Nat Turner?

14:56.742 --> 14:58.776
And this dude comes up
with, like, what...

14:58.777 --> 15:01.212
- Offtrack, Offbeat, Offswitch, Dipswitch...
- Dad, Dad, Dad,

15:01.213 --> 15:03.220
Dad, it's called Offset.
His name is Offset.

15:03.221 --> 15:04.828
We ain't watching this anymore.

15:08.022 --> 15:09.825
Look Dad the movie is almost over.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.894
You said we're gonna support
everything black, all right?

15:11.895 --> 15:13.673
Let's just finish this
movie as a family.

15:13.674 --> 15:14.886
Yeah, it's okay,

15:14.887 --> 15:17.221
Dad. Look, becoming woke
is a process, okay?

15:18.624 --> 15:20.892
We need repellant to get
to George Washington Carver.

15:20.893 --> 15:23.294
Oh. You talking
about my special stuff?

15:23.295 --> 15:25.563
Yeah, I guess I could swing that,

15:25.564 --> 15:27.165
considering you run with this...

15:27.166 --> 15:30.368
pretty, thick...

15:31.837 --> 15:33.504
...grown little mama,

15:33.505 --> 15:35.473
- you know what I'm saying?
- Okay, okay, young man, uh,

15:35.474 --> 15:36.841
this is my woman you're talking about.

15:36.842 --> 15:39.177
I am no man's woman.

15:39.178 --> 15:41.245
The whole point of my life's work

15:41.246 --> 15:43.815
is that no one owns me.

15:43.816 --> 15:46.150
All right, we'll figure out
who she belongs to later.

15:46.151 --> 15:48.953
The main thing is get this boy
to George Washington Carver.

15:52.224 --> 15:53.724
This boy is immune to the virus,
but we have no money.

15:53.725 --> 15:56.027
Man, how I know y'all
ain't just hustling me,

15:56.028 --> 15:57.895
you know what I'm saying,
for my my repellant?

15:57.896 --> 15:59.797
Young man, we're not
hustling you, okay?

15:59.798 --> 16:02.667
We can prove it.
All we need is a zombie.

16:07.506 --> 16:09.340
Hey, how's my mutey pie?

16:09.341 --> 16:12.009
Go on, let that man bite you.

16:12.010 --> 16:14.512
Come on. Come on.

16:14.513 --> 16:18.683
Aw, y'all are some sick-ass folk.

16:23.288 --> 16:25.123
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What...

16:25.124 --> 16:26.958
What am I doing
making this repellant when y'all

16:26.959 --> 16:29.193
about to make
a killing on this vaccine?

16:29.194 --> 16:31.395
Forget all that. Hey, look.
I'm coming with y'all.

16:31.396 --> 16:32.830
Wait a minute.

16:32.831 --> 16:35.366
I think I'm having one of my fai...

16:35.367 --> 16:38.169
- What happened?
- What? Harry?

16:38.170 --> 16:41.472
Don't worry about it.
That's what she do.

16:41.473 --> 16:42.974
She'll be okay.

16:42.975 --> 16:45.610
She'll wake up in a few hours
good as new.

16:51.850 --> 16:53.951
Just gonna leave her on the floor?

17:05.830 --> 17:07.064
Aah!

17:14.071 --> 17:17.108
No!

17:19.478 --> 17:22.213
Damn. So what's Harriet
gonna do now, man?

17:22.214 --> 17:23.214
She just got bit.

17:23.214 --> 17:25.116
If I got bit I wouldn't tell y'all.

17:25.117 --> 17:26.517
No, I wouldn't.

17:26.518 --> 17:29.387
I would just walk up on you and smile,

17:29.388 --> 17:32.023
like I'm about to give you
a loving hug...

17:32.024 --> 17:34.959
- Dead.
- Wait, wait.

17:34.960 --> 17:37.228
So you'll kill both your sons?

17:37.229 --> 17:40.765
And Brittany, too.
Yeah, b-because I love y'all.

17:40.766 --> 17:42.233
I want to keep the family together.

17:42.234 --> 17:44.702
I'm not gonna be that
stereotypical, undead black man

17:44.703 --> 17:46.237
who leaves his kids.

17:46.238 --> 17:47.605
Okay, Hope you slept well.

17:47.606 --> 17:49.207
We got a long journey to go.

17:49.208 --> 17:50.374
Frederick,

17:50.375 --> 17:52.610
I want you to know I love you,

17:52.611 --> 17:54.612
but you have to go without me.

17:54.613 --> 17:57.148
Wait, are you trying
to break up with me?

17:57.149 --> 17:59.850
I get it, I'm a, I'm a great orator

17:59.851 --> 18:01.319
and most women find out,
they get all intimidated

18:01.320 --> 18:02.853
'cause, "Oh, man,
you speak everywhere.

18:02.854 --> 18:05.089
People love talking to you.
You know, you..."

18:05.090 --> 18:06.424
Stop talking.

18:06.425 --> 18:09.694
I can't go with you
because I've been bitten.

18:10.762 --> 18:12.730
Oh, God, zombie!

18:14.766 --> 18:16.000
Damn.

18:20.606 --> 18:22.039
Ay, okay.

18:22.040 --> 18:24.475
Okay, maybe the filmmaker's
trying to say

18:24.476 --> 18:27.945
that the NRA is trying to...

18:27.946 --> 18:30.514
Look, I got nothing, man.
I got nothing.

18:30.515 --> 18:32.984
Okay, this whole entire time
I've been, trying to be positive

18:32.985 --> 18:35.353
about this movie, but it's
freaking terrible, all right?

18:35.354 --> 18:37.989
What's so woke about shooting
Harriet Tubman like that?

18:37.990 --> 18:40.257
And has anyone noticed
the misogyny at all?

18:42.461 --> 18:46.264
A lady zombie bit Harriet,
and then they shot her.

18:46.265 --> 18:48.366
And all the men still alive.

18:48.367 --> 18:50.701
If liking this movie
is what's being woke,

18:50.702 --> 18:52.703
then I'm-a go right back to sleep.

18:52.704 --> 18:55.206
Look, I'm all for
supporting black art,

18:55.207 --> 18:57.441
but this is what happens

18:57.442 --> 18:59.477
when you give the wrong
black people money.

18:59.478 --> 19:00.645
Okay, look,

19:00.646 --> 19:02.446
I don't care what the critics say,

19:02.447 --> 19:04.398
this movie is insane.

19:04.399 --> 19:06.579
But-but when you think about it.

19:07.330 --> 19:09.527
Look, aren't y'all tired
of all black mainstream movies

19:09.528 --> 19:10.829
having to be important?

19:10.830 --> 19:13.431
I mean, this movie
is not important at all.

19:13.432 --> 19:17.368
It is weird and it's pointless.
And white people get to make

19:17.369 --> 19:20.271
weird and pointless movies
all the time.

19:20.272 --> 19:24.209
So, just maybe,
this movie being made...

19:24.210 --> 19:26.978
is progress.

19:26.979 --> 19:29.214
Black mediocrity.

19:29.215 --> 19:31.349
That's right.

19:31.350 --> 19:34.352
You know something, look, guys,
what we need to do...

19:34.353 --> 19:35.987
we need to go out in these streets

19:35.988 --> 19:38.156
and let everybody know
this movie is great

19:38.157 --> 19:41.659
before white people find out
that we think it sucks.

19:41.660 --> 19:42.827
Absolutely.

19:42.828 --> 19:44.162
Yup, already tweeted I loved it.

19:44.163 --> 19:46.264
- And I re-tweeted you.
- Saw that.

19:46.265 --> 19:47.732
See, that's what I'm
talking about. Great work.

19:47.733 --> 19:50.301
All right, let's...
now let's finish this garbage.

19:55.608 --> 19:58.409
Voilà. The vaccine.

19:58.410 --> 20:01.679
What about the boy? Will he be okay?

20:01.680 --> 20:03.214
Of course he will.

20:03.215 --> 20:06.084
I've been feeding him homegrown,
organic, sweet potatoes.

20:06.085 --> 20:08.820
He'll be talking in five seconds.

20:08.821 --> 20:10.889
Five, four,

20:10.890 --> 20:12.991
three, two...

20:12.992 --> 20:15.259
H-Hi.

20:17.930 --> 20:19.564
Wait a minute.

20:19.565 --> 20:22.066
Y-Young man, um...

20:22.067 --> 20:24.235
what is your name?

20:26.472 --> 20:28.740
Barack Obama.

20:28.741 --> 20:31.943
Wow.

20:31.944 --> 20:33.645
Oh, man.

20:33.646 --> 20:35.813
See, that's how you make
a great movie right there.

20:35.814 --> 20:38.583
You-you take people on a ride
and you confuse them,

20:38.584 --> 20:41.352
and then at the end,
you have this amazing moment.

20:43.989 --> 20:46.791
- Want to watch it again?
- Hell no.

20:49.188 --> 20:52.494
You can't have Harriet Tubman
getting nasty on the other side.

20:52.495 --> 20:55.630
- Damn.
- Damn it!

20:55.631 --> 20:59.501
The gods don't want us
to speak about Harriet.

20:59.502 --> 21:02.647
Like, zombies don't drink, have sex,

21:02.648 --> 21:04.415
or take drugs.

21:05.350 --> 21:07.585
Drink much?

21:08.987 --> 21:11.789
He called it "peanut butter."

21:11.790 --> 21:15.393
Now, if George Washington Carver
can do that with a peanut,

21:15.394 --> 21:18.195
think what he can do with
that mute boy right there.

21:21.433 --> 21:24.602
Y'all see what he does
with celery sticks.
