WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:03.581
Gloria, honey!
I'm ready whenever you are!

00:03.637 --> 00:05.776
We should hurry.
The reservation's at 7:00.

00:05.840 --> 00:07.444
Claire, where are you?

00:07.508 --> 00:09.510
Okay, see you in two.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.821
What are you doing?

00:15.883 --> 00:17.829
I'm striking a seductive pose
for your mother.

00:17.885 --> 00:20.331
Gross.
But I like the suit. Is that new?

00:20.388 --> 00:22.334
Oh, yeah.
Now that his honey gots her own money...

00:22.390 --> 00:25.064
Daddy went and snagged hisself
some new threads, girl.

00:25.126 --> 00:27.003
Hands down, your funniest voice.

00:27.061 --> 00:28.972
Bordering on the offensive.

00:29.030 --> 00:31.408
Listen, I'm a Realtor,
and I work a lot with families...

00:31.465 --> 00:33.968
so normally I dial the sexy back to five.

00:34.035 --> 00:37.482
But, uh, Claire's been
working very hard lately.

00:37.538 --> 00:40.314
So tonight-

00:44.345 --> 00:46.791
Stick around if you want to see
your mom's tongue fall out of her mouth.

00:46.847 --> 00:50.420
Not unless you want to see
my lunch fall out of mine.

00:50.484 --> 00:54.022
Oh, I'm sorry. I am late!
Traffic was horrible.

00:54.088 --> 00:56.694
Sounds like someone could use
a tall drink of water.

00:56.757 --> 00:58.259
Yeah, right. Water.

01:01.695 --> 01:03.697
Luke, what did I tell you about
leaning back on that thing?

01:03.764 --> 01:06.267
- I don't know. "Don't"?
- Honey, what are you still doing here?

01:06.333 --> 01:07.607
You're supposed to be babysitting Joe.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.511
But I have to drop off Alex
to watch Lily first...

01:09.570 --> 01:10.674
and she's still not ready.

01:10.738 --> 01:13.014
She can't be concerned
about her looks, right?

01:13.074 --> 01:14.781
- I can hear you!
- I'm kidding.

01:14.842 --> 01:17.345
I'm just saying it'd be sad
to think she actually tries.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.049
- Heard that too!
- It was a joke.

01:19.113 --> 01:21.024
Man, do big ears actually hear better?

01:21.082 --> 01:22.823
Oh, my God. Just stop talking.

01:22.883 --> 01:26.194
Okay, girls. it's time for you guys
to hit the road.

01:26.253 --> 01:28.790
- Okay, bye.
- Bye. Why aren't you going with them?

01:28.856 --> 01:31.359
He wanted to stay home.
I said it was okay.

01:31.425 --> 01:32.904
- By himself?
- It's fine.

01:32.960 --> 01:35.133
If he's old enough to watch
The Walking Dead with me-

01:35.196 --> 01:36.937
- He's not.
- then he's old enough to stay home alone.

01:36.997 --> 01:38.908
- He's not.
- Claire, he's not a little boy anymore.

01:42.136 --> 01:44.377
- I'm fine.
- See how deep his voice is?

01:46.841 --> 01:48.149
Are you okay?

01:49.210 --> 01:51.087
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:51.145 --> 01:53.182
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:53.247 --> 01:55.284
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:55.349 --> 01:57.260
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:57.318 --> 01:58.558
♪ Hey,♪♪

02:02.289 --> 02:04.667
Oh, this is Haley.

02:04.725 --> 02:08.172
- "Be there in five. Alex took ducking forever."
- it's fine.

02:08.229 --> 02:10.765
Know what? We have to pick
the "save the date" card. I'm at a loss.

02:10.830 --> 02:13.675
Can we do it tomorrow? I hate the way
my dad looks at us when we're late...

02:13.734 --> 02:17.910
like we're two silly queens blasting disco music,
primping, losing track of time.

02:17.972 --> 02:20.179
Wow, it gets really busy in that head, huh?

02:20.241 --> 02:21.584
Okay, quick. Which one do you like?

02:21.642 --> 02:23.781
- Uh, that one.
- Really? I think you picked too quick.

02:23.844 --> 02:26.256
- No, I didn't. I really like that one.
- I really like this one.

02:26.313 --> 02:29.294
Then why did you ducking ask me?
Fine, go with yours.

02:29.350 --> 02:31.455
- If that's the one you really like.
- Can you just get ready?

02:31.519 --> 02:33.430
- Yeah. Lily, hit it.
- On it!

02:40.060 --> 02:42.097
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

02:42.163 --> 02:43.938
I've never seen you so excited
about a restaurant.

02:43.998 --> 02:46.171
I've waited six weeks
for this reservation.

02:46.233 --> 02:48.873
They have an Australian Wagyu beef...

02:48.936 --> 02:50.574
that's supposed to change your life.

02:50.638 --> 02:52.311
In the way heart disease
changes your life?

02:52.373 --> 02:54.250
Because you're a pillar of health.

02:54.308 --> 02:57.687
They only feed this cow alfalfa,
barley and red wine...

02:57.745 --> 03:03.058
and some chef handpicks
each cut, dry ages it 35 days...

03:03.117 --> 03:07.259
before cooking it to a perfect medium-rare-
all for me.

03:07.321 --> 03:08.891
Doesn't the wine make the cow drunk?

03:08.956 --> 03:11.334
It's not The Far Side.
The cow doesn't drive anywhere.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.497
Gloria, let's go.

03:13.561 --> 03:15.268
- You know she's not here, right?
- What?

03:15.329 --> 03:16.740
She's having her hair blown out.

03:16.797 --> 03:19.334
That's a thing? That I pay for?

03:19.400 --> 03:21.175
Gloria's always late.

03:21.235 --> 03:24.216
Then I get mad and tell her to hurry,
we yell, and it just takes longer.

03:24.271 --> 03:27.218
So I promised myself,
no matter how late she is...

03:27.274 --> 03:29.413
just to take some deep breaths
and stay calm.

03:29.476 --> 03:31.581
That's the only thing
I learned in Lamaze class...

03:31.645 --> 03:33.955
because we were always late.

03:34.014 --> 03:36.187
Hi!

03:36.250 --> 03:38.389
Everybody's driving like crazy tonight.

03:38.452 --> 03:41.399
I took San Vicente thinking
that I was gonna save some time...

03:41.455 --> 03:43.628
but then they're working on the sewer.

03:43.691 --> 03:45.693
So I went around Montana, down Moreno.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.796
Ay. but then there's that dip in the road.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.704
I always forget
about that dip in the road.

03:49.763 --> 03:53.870
I hit it so hard that I spilled the coffee
all over the car.

03:53.934 --> 03:56.175
Did I tell you who I had coffee with?

03:59.340 --> 04:02.116
I think Luke is scared
to be left in the house alone...

04:02.176 --> 04:04.383
and he's just pretending
to be brave for you.

04:04.445 --> 04:07.983
Honey, he's 14.
We left Alex alone when she was 10.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.891
We didn't leave her. We forgot her.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.896
And when we got home, she was fine-

04:11.952 --> 04:13.260
- physically.
- Mmm.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.561
Plus, she's still friends
with that sweet 911 operator.

04:15.623 --> 04:16.966
Yeah.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.935
- What are you doing?
- Making sure that Luke knows...

04:18.993 --> 04:20.471
what to do in case of emergency.

04:20.527 --> 04:22.370
Of course he does.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.502
Someone's at the door.

04:25.566 --> 04:28.012
Luke, it's just your mom testing you.

04:28.068 --> 04:31.515
Don't worry, Mom. if I hear that
while you're gone, I won't answer.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.745
I'll just hide where no one can find me.

04:36.076 --> 04:38.556
- Cam, come on. Let's go.
- Two seconds.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.559
I thought that being with a man meant
that I wouldn't have to wait around like this.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.686
I feel cheated. I do.

04:43.751 --> 04:45.560
Let's play dolls.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.929
Actually, I want to read you
one of my favorite books.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.865
It's called Little Women,
and it's about four sisters...

04:49.923 --> 04:52.130
who overcome poverty and the patriarchy-

04:52.192 --> 04:54.229
Nope! Dolls.

04:54.295 --> 04:56.275
This is Ashley. She's a wife.

04:56.330 --> 04:59.368
Well, I hope that's not
the only thing that defines her.

04:59.433 --> 05:03.210
- Does she have a career?
- Nope, she shops. Where's Haley?

05:03.270 --> 05:06.513
How come it takes me five minutes
to get ready, and you take forever?

05:06.573 --> 05:09.679
Oh, please. I could get ready
in five minutes too if I dressed like-

05:10.644 --> 05:12.282
You did it again?

05:12.346 --> 05:13.882
- Not changing.
- Not changing.

05:13.947 --> 05:17.121
Fasten your seat belts.
It's going to be a crazy night.

05:17.184 --> 05:18.959
No, honey. "it's gonna be a bumpy night."

05:19.019 --> 05:20.930
Remember? You can't have two dads
and make that mistake.

05:20.988 --> 05:24.367
- Bumpy night.
- Okay, so how often does this happen?

05:24.425 --> 05:27.031
- Too often.
- Men just don't have that many options.

05:27.094 --> 05:30.473
I can't tell you the number of times I've walked
by a women's boutique and just thought...

05:30.531 --> 05:32.602
"What I would do
to have that many choices."

05:32.666 --> 05:34.942
Don't ever say that again.
I don't like any part of it.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.642
One of us has to change.
We look like twin toddlers at church.

05:37.705 --> 05:40.447
Yeah, tell me about it. And this place
we're going is supposed to be super hip.

05:40.507 --> 05:41.918
We're probably gonna run into someone.

05:41.975 --> 05:44.251
And come on.
I don't have that many outfits.

05:44.311 --> 05:46.222
My clothes take up exactly
one-quarter of the closet.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.226
That's not fair.
My clothes are bigger than yours.

05:48.282 --> 05:50.319
I hate to play this card,
but I was dressed first.

05:50.384 --> 05:54.230
Oh, that is silly. Lily, it's time to play
"Who Wore it Best?"

05:55.856 --> 05:57.927
Nope. I'm not doing this again. I can't.

05:57.991 --> 06:00.096
Fine. Alex.

06:00.160 --> 06:03.733
Uh, I don't know.
Boys' clothes aren't really my thing.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.401
Really?

06:09.570 --> 06:11.572
I don't get it.
Doesn't the wine get the cow drunk?

06:11.638 --> 06:13.174
- Thank you.
- Honest to God.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.186
Have neither of you seen a cow?
They're huge.

06:15.242 --> 06:16.653
I bet tequila would do it quicker.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.849
It's not the goal to get the cow drunk.

06:18.912 --> 06:21.483
You gotta be kidding me.
Manny, see why your mother's taking so long.

06:21.548 --> 06:23.653
And don't tell her I sent you.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.129
- Mom, hurry!
- Don't yell. I could have yelled.

06:26.186 --> 06:28.689
- Then why didn't you?
- Because I didn't want to yell. I want you to go.

06:28.756 --> 06:30.997
- Why can't you go?
- Why can't you do what I ask?

06:31.058 --> 06:32.662
I'm trying to do something new here!

06:32.726 --> 06:34.637
Stop yelling, Jay! I'm ready!

06:34.695 --> 06:37.835
Oh, geez. Haley, Manny knows
where all the baby stuff is...

06:37.898 --> 06:41.072
and if Joe won't go to bed, just put on Gladys
Knight and bounce him around a little bit.

06:41.135 --> 06:43.547
Oh, you still do that?
I loved when you did that with us.

06:43.604 --> 06:46.778
How about that? Somebody in this family
remembers a nice thing I did.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.148
I remember something nice you did.

06:48.208 --> 06:51.348
You bought me this dress yesterday
when you were working.

06:51.412 --> 06:53.517
- How do I look?
- Gorgeous. Let's go.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.457
You haven't even looked at me.
Haley?

06:55.516 --> 06:57.826
Well, "A," your hair looks amazing,
like you just got off a horse.

06:57.885 --> 06:59.990
That's exactly what I was going for.

07:00.053 --> 07:01.828
- But if I had one thought-
- Nope! No thoughts.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.425
Are those for sure the best earrings?

07:03.490 --> 07:04.992
They seem to be kind of getting lost.

07:05.058 --> 07:07.231
- I have the same color in a bigger size.
- How much bigger?

07:07.294 --> 07:09.296
- Like a meter.
- A meter? That's like a foot.

07:09.363 --> 07:11.969
- Actually, it's like a yard.
- Oh, sorry- it's like a millimeter.

07:12.032 --> 07:14.603
- You mean a centimeter.
- All this math. Just show me.

07:14.668 --> 07:15.908
Okay.

07:15.969 --> 07:17.471
- Gloria!
- What?

07:19.473 --> 07:22.682
I think the new earrings are really gonna
tie your whole outfit together.

07:22.743 --> 07:24.882
You're so sweet.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.553
Wow. That was very mature of you.

07:28.615 --> 07:32.028
Yeah, well, I'm a lot older now
than when she started getting dressed.

07:33.554 --> 07:35.227
So this sound-

07:36.690 --> 07:37.930
That's the doorbell.

07:37.991 --> 07:40.062
That other sound was the smoke alarm.

07:40.127 --> 07:43.074
- Got it.
- Okay, and if you're hungry, don't order a pizza.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.666
They don't screen those delivery guys.

07:44.731 --> 07:47.041
- Half of them are ex-cons.
- Stop it. You're gonna scare him.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.842
- It's gonna be fine.
- But if you do choke, you've gotta throw yourself...

07:49.903 --> 07:52.941
- against the back of a chair to get the food out.
- He'll just drink stuff.

07:53.006 --> 07:55.919
- Nothing from under the sink.
- Even if it's lemony?

07:55.976 --> 07:57.284
I'm just messing with you.

07:57.344 --> 07:58.948
In case of fire, go low and get out.

07:59.012 --> 08:01.652
- In case of earthquake-
- Wait. You think there could be an earthquake?

08:01.715 --> 08:03.626
Last time we had one,
that big cabinet fell on me.

08:03.684 --> 08:05.595
- No, it didn't.
- It did?

08:05.652 --> 08:08.565
- Let's go.
- Bye, honey. We love you. Do you have the keys?

08:08.622 --> 08:11.228
We're gonna check in. I promise!

08:15.195 --> 08:16.936
Uh, what's going on?

08:16.997 --> 08:19.136
- New suit?
- This old thing?

08:19.199 --> 08:20.735
- Yes, it is.
- Huh.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.803
I got it at this hipster place downtown.

08:22.870 --> 08:25.441
- You like it?
- It's tight.

08:25.506 --> 08:26.985
Well, the salesman said
it was the style...

08:27.040 --> 08:29.042
and he looked like a Mumford & Son,
so I think he'd know.

08:29.109 --> 08:31.089
Mmm. Let's go.

08:32.746 --> 08:35.989
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, FloJo.

08:38.118 --> 08:40.222
You know what? We don't have time
for this. I'll just change.

08:40.287 --> 08:43.734
Well, now I feel bad. Let's both
just change. That's the fair thing to do.

08:43.789 --> 08:45.167
Okay, fine. But quickly, please.

08:45.225 --> 08:46.568
Okay.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.103
Uh-

08:54.234 --> 08:55.508
I don't know.

08:55.569 --> 08:57.139
It's blue.

08:57.204 --> 09:00.048
Yeah, this one's so yellow.

09:00.107 --> 09:02.951
Oh, you know what? I have a stain
on this one. I can't wear it.

09:03.010 --> 09:05.115
Oh, paisley, yeah. I don't know.

09:05.178 --> 09:07.590
- Are you kidding me right now?
- What?

09:07.648 --> 09:10.754
I know this trick, Cam.
You take forever to pick out an outfit...

09:10.817 --> 09:13.161
knowing very well that I'll say,
"Let's just go," because we're late.

09:13.220 --> 09:16.690
Meantime, you get credit for offering to change
while I'm the one who actually does.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.259
- As usual.
- Excuse me.

09:18.325 --> 09:22.364
- Are you accusing me of manipulating you to get my way?
- Actually-

09:22.429 --> 09:24.773
Because that's what
my mother used to accuse me of...

09:24.831 --> 09:27.835
and I gotta say that brings up
a lot of stuff with me.

09:27.901 --> 09:31.007
- You're crying without tears.
- Give me a minute.

09:33.874 --> 09:37.287
"'Christmas won't be Christmas
without any presents,' grumbled Jo.

09:37.344 --> 09:39.620
'It's so dreadful to be poor,' sighed"-

09:39.680 --> 09:41.956
Stop. I hate this.

09:42.015 --> 09:43.790
Can I put makeup on you?

09:43.850 --> 09:45.591
Why does everyone ask me that?

09:45.652 --> 09:47.393
Let's just have
a good time tonight, all right?

09:47.454 --> 09:49.092
- I'm not mad.
- Okay, good.

09:49.156 --> 09:51.158
And you do look super-duper
handsome in that.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.363
Don't even.
I'm gonna grab a water for the road.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.737
Yeah, get me a soda.
Okay, Alex. Thank you so much.

09:55.796 --> 09:58.037
Have a fun night. Honey, we love you.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.875
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.675
Okay, and remember,
no eating in the living room.

10:02.736 --> 10:04.511
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

10:05.939 --> 10:08.715
- What did you do? What did you do?
- Oh, come on.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.948
- You can't possibly think-
- You shook this can...

10:11.011 --> 10:12.991
so you could wear the outfit
that I wanted to wear?

10:13.046 --> 10:14.855
That is exactly what I think.

10:14.915 --> 10:17.759
That is insane. You saw me take it
from the refrigerator and bring it to you.

10:17.818 --> 10:20.264
Did I? Or were you out of my sight
for the two seconds...

10:20.320 --> 10:22.357
that it took you to get
from the refrigerator to here...

10:22.422 --> 10:25.426
which would have given you exactly
the right amount of time to shake the can?

10:25.492 --> 10:28.166
Nice theory, Nancy Grace,
but I'm not that petty.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.174
Okay, you two. Did you see anything?

10:30.230 --> 10:32.767
Just pretend you're coloring.

10:38.271 --> 10:39.545
Okay, what are you doing?

10:39.606 --> 10:41.745
I'm trying to reach the mirror.
I got something in my eye.

10:41.808 --> 10:42.980
Hi You've reached the Dunphys-

10:43.043 --> 10:44.750
Why isn't Luke picking up?

10:44.811 --> 10:47.951
It's hard to reach the phone when you're
tied up by a recently paroled pizza guy.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.154
Ha, ha. You're very funny.

10:50.217 --> 10:52.322
What are you doing?

10:52.386 --> 10:54.388
I know it sounds weird-
call it mother's intuition-

10:54.454 --> 10:56.525
but I just have this feeling
that something is wrong.

10:56.590 --> 10:59.503
Fine, do what you want,
but I've just about had it up to-

10:59.559 --> 11:01.561
higher than here with this.

11:02.562 --> 11:04.405
Oh!

11:04.464 --> 11:06.137
Die, pizza man!

11:06.199 --> 11:09.271
Ow! Ow! Stop! Stop! Stop!

11:09.336 --> 11:11.111
Oh. Sorry, Mom.

11:13.206 --> 11:16.153
Wow. Told you
he could take care of himself.

11:18.578 --> 11:20.057
Move.

11:25.385 --> 11:28.229
Why does she do this?
We're gonna lose our table.

11:28.288 --> 11:31.201
She knows how important it is to me
to be on time.

11:31.258 --> 11:33.795
- This is torture.
- I think you've lost perspective, Jay.

11:33.860 --> 11:36.306
You know what I would give
to wait around for a woman like that?

11:36.363 --> 11:39.071
Reel it in, creepy.
That's your mother up there.

11:39.132 --> 11:42.841
Sorry, sorry. Once I changed the earrings,
I had to change the shoes.

11:42.903 --> 11:46.612
And then I tried on one of Gloria's old dresses,
which made me feel like a 10-year-old boy.

11:46.673 --> 11:48.311
Ay. your body's beautiful.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.480
- I agree.
- Take it outside the family.

11:50.544 --> 11:51.989
Okay, we ready to go?

11:52.045 --> 11:53.991
Oh, wait. I have the wrong lipstick.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.856
- Oh, that's it! I've had it!
- Just one minute!

11:55.916 --> 11:58.123
Nothing takes a minute with you.
We're leaving right now.

11:58.185 --> 12:01.530
I don't care what you have to do.
It's bad enough you're being rude to me...

12:01.588 --> 12:04.933
but you're being rude to the people
sitting there waiting for us!

12:04.991 --> 12:09.371
Sorry. You're the first to arrive,
and we can't seat you till everyone's here.

12:10.163 --> 12:11.665
I hope you're happy.

12:19.673 --> 12:21.812
Where the hell is everybody?

12:21.875 --> 12:25.049
- Yes, I hate waiting like this.
- Do you?

12:25.112 --> 12:28.855
Just because everybody else is late
doesn't make it okay for us to be late.

12:28.915 --> 12:31.395
- I can't get ready fast with all the yelling!
- I wasn't yelling.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.124
You see, you're doing it again!

12:33.186 --> 12:35.826
Gloria, you do this every single time.

12:35.889 --> 12:39.530
If you know how long it takes you to get ready,
why don't you start earlier?

12:39.593 --> 12:41.698
- I have my reasons.
- I would love to know them.

12:41.762 --> 12:44.709
- You're going to be mean.
- I promise I won't be.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.542
I like to make an entrance.

12:48.602 --> 12:50.445
What's that now?

12:50.504 --> 12:55.112
I like the part where I go in
and everybody's waiting for me...

12:55.175 --> 12:57.519
and they say-

12:57.577 --> 13:02.458
"Gloria, you look so pretty,
and that dress is so beautiful."

13:02.516 --> 13:05.429
- Is that so bad?
- I don't love it.

13:06.620 --> 13:09.123
Oh, this room is so nice.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.759
I know. it's almost as gorgeous as-

13:10.824 --> 13:12.326
You monster!

13:12.392 --> 13:14.531
What? Oh, this?

13:14.594 --> 13:17.336
Well, you know, you couldn't wear it,
so I figured, what's the harm?

13:17.397 --> 13:19.206
Mmm. You know what?
I will go over there...

13:19.266 --> 13:21.542
and I will be as socially magnetic
as I always am.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.171
We will put this on the back burner...

13:23.236 --> 13:25.944
but underneath,
I want you to know I am fuming.

13:26.006 --> 13:28.612
- Hey, Jay, where's Gloria?
- She's, uh-

13:28.675 --> 13:31.246
- She was here a second-
- There are my boys!

13:31.311 --> 13:33.086
Gloria, you look so pretty.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.625
Your dress is so beautiful.

13:36.216 --> 13:38.127
You gotta be kidding me.

13:38.185 --> 13:40.529
You let him watch
those scary shows with you...

13:40.587 --> 13:42.931
and then we leave him home alone at night.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.366
Of course he's gonna arm himself.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.734
He was fine until you gave him
your "50 ways to die" speech.

13:46.793 --> 13:49.364
- What was the one about the welcome mat?
- They are highly flammable.

13:49.429 --> 13:52.706
For seven to 10 people a year,
they may as well say, "Welcome to the morgue."

13:52.766 --> 13:54.803
You know what? Drop it.
I don't want to fight in public.

13:54.868 --> 13:55.869
- It's embarrassing.
- Fine.

13:55.936 --> 13:57.643
Hi. How are you?

13:57.704 --> 13:59.877
- Good evening.
- Good- Oh, my leg's asleep!

13:59.940 --> 14:02.113
My leg's asleep. Okay, thank you.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.052
Oh.

14:07.547 --> 14:11.222
Sir, if the rest of your party doesn't arrive soon,
we have to give up your table.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.560
- Any minute.
- Again, Dad, sorry we're late.

14:13.620 --> 14:17.796
Yeah, Mitchell put on some music,
and we were primping and dancing around...

14:17.858 --> 14:20.338
and I guess, well,
we just lost track of time.

14:20.393 --> 14:23.067
Actually, Dad, what happened
was Cam was practicing this trick...

14:23.129 --> 14:26.372
where he pretends to be accommodating
and then magically gets his way.

14:26.433 --> 14:27.673
There they are.

14:27.734 --> 14:29.771
- We need a second.
- Cam, no!

14:29.836 --> 14:32.077
- Where are you guys going?
- Can't talk. Too mad.

14:32.138 --> 14:33.276
Oh.

14:34.541 --> 14:35.986
Come on.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.958
Hi, Dad. Where's Gloria?

14:41.014 --> 14:44.188
- She- For the love of-
- There you are!

14:44.251 --> 14:47.130
- Whoa! Wow!
- Oh, my goodness! That dress!

14:47.187 --> 14:49.667
Gloria, holy mackerel.

14:49.723 --> 14:52.829
We're so sorry we're late.
We had to drop Luke off at your place.

14:52.893 --> 14:55.601
Phil wanted him to stay home alone,
but he got scared.

14:55.662 --> 14:58.939
Man, I can't wait to get
some food in my mouth and yours.

14:58.999 --> 15:01.809
Poor Haley. What is she going to do
with all those boys?

15:01.868 --> 15:04.815
♪ I'll be with him ♪

15:04.871 --> 15:06.145
♪ I know you will ♪

15:06.206 --> 15:08.516
♪ On that midnight
train to Georgia ♪

15:08.575 --> 15:11.021
♪ Leaving on the midnight train
to Georgia ♪

15:11.077 --> 15:13.455
- ♪ Hey, hey, hey ♪
- Whoo, whoo!

15:13.513 --> 15:17.484
You know what? I resent the implication
that I always get my way.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.325
Really? The "save the date" cards.

15:19.386 --> 15:21.866
- For our wedding?
- Oh, so it is still our wedding.

15:21.922 --> 15:23.526
I wasn't sure I was even invited...

15:23.590 --> 15:26.571
because you keep asking for my opinion
and then doing the exact opposite.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.537
- That's one thing.
- What about the music?

15:28.595 --> 15:30.506
I think our love
deserves a band, not a deejay.

15:30.563 --> 15:32.565
- The tablecloths.
- They make sneakers out of that fabric.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.805
You won't let me pick one thing,
and you want to know why?

15:34.868 --> 15:37.178
Because I have better taste than you.

15:37.237 --> 15:39.843
I was gonna say because you're a control freak.

15:39.906 --> 15:41.977
And how can you think
that I have bad taste?

15:42.042 --> 15:44.079
We chose the exact same outfit.

15:44.144 --> 15:47.318
Did we? I wore fun loafers.
You wore sensible oxfords.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.917
Your collar's buttoned down.
Mine's a more current widespread.

15:49.983 --> 15:52.987
And I chose a bold pocket square
to bring out the stripe in the shirt...

15:53.053 --> 15:57.024
all of which you wouldn't have thought of
because, well, I've already said.

15:57.090 --> 15:59.331
You don't like my oxfords?

15:59.392 --> 16:01.804
I'm sorry. I'm being harsh.

16:01.861 --> 16:03.340
- They're fine.
- Thank you.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.672
For a small-town detective.

16:05.732 --> 16:07.734
Okay, look.
I can't help myself. I did it again.

16:07.801 --> 16:11.442
So I-I don't love them, but I do love you.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.347
And I don't want you to feel left out.

16:13.406 --> 16:16.751
Okay. Then let me have a say
in planning our wedding.

16:16.810 --> 16:20.781
- That's what we agreed to.
- You will and you should, and I'm sorry.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.283
Thank you.

16:23.350 --> 16:26.126
- Can you just do one thing for me?
- Sure.

16:26.186 --> 16:29.929
Just be honest,
and I'll let this go forever.

16:29.990 --> 16:31.901
Did you shake that can?

16:31.958 --> 16:33.096
No.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.565
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

16:38.031 --> 16:40.568
See, Phil?
They don't let Manny stay home alone.

16:40.633 --> 16:41.976
Why do you think Haley's there?

16:42.035 --> 16:44.106
Actually, we let Manny
stay home all the time.

16:44.170 --> 16:49.415
And sometimes he makes cupcakes, which I
could use one right about now. Or a potato.

16:49.476 --> 16:51.456
Haley's there to take care of Joe.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.650
Are you sure, guys?
'Cause Claire's always right about everything...

16:53.713 --> 16:55.215
all the time, forever and ever.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.986
Thank God.
Here they are. Fiona, we're all here.

16:59.052 --> 17:01.328
Actually, Dad, we could use a moment.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.994
I'm going to eat my hand.

17:04.057 --> 17:07.435
"Jo immediately sat up, put her hands
in her pockets and began to whistle.

17:07.493 --> 17:09.473
'Don't, Jo. it's so boyish!'

17:09.529 --> 17:10.734
'That's why I do it.'

17:10.797 --> 17:13.073
'I detest rude, unladylike girls!'

17:13.133 --> 17:15.477
'I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!"'

17:15.535 --> 17:17.810
Okay, this stinks. I give up.

17:17.871 --> 17:20.613
Thank God. Want to see your hair?

17:22.409 --> 17:25.481
Wow. Lily, that's actually good.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.387
Can you really do makeup?

17:27.446 --> 17:29.085
Stay there.

17:31.251 --> 17:33.857
Is it really too much to ask
that you consult me...

17:33.920 --> 17:35.399
before you make such a big decision?

17:35.455 --> 17:37.992
Claire, when you went back to work,
you asked me to take the reins.

17:38.058 --> 17:39.935
So I think you need to trust me now.

17:39.993 --> 17:41.995
Do you really think I'd put Luke
in a dangerous situation?

17:42.062 --> 17:43.769
He's my favorite,
which I did not just say.

17:43.830 --> 17:46.811
- If anything happens to him-
- it won't. if you haven't noticed...

17:46.866 --> 17:49.779
I'm pretty good at this, as hard as it is
for you to pay me a compliment.

17:49.836 --> 17:53.579
- Where is that coming from?
- Well, do you like this suit?

17:53.640 --> 17:56.018
I wouldn't know,
because all you said was, "it's tight"...

17:56.076 --> 17:57.646
and not in a cool black way.

17:57.710 --> 18:01.988
Wait, a-are you trying to say
that you squeezed yourself in that for me?

18:02.048 --> 18:06.360
Yes. You've been a little distracted at work,
so I wanted to look nice for you.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.296
Oh, honey.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.960
I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

18:12.025 --> 18:13.561
You're right.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.367
Luke probably would have been fine...

18:15.428 --> 18:17.430
and I am having a hard time letting go.

18:17.497 --> 18:20.501
And if there's one person
in the world I trust, it is you.

18:20.567 --> 18:21.671
And?

18:22.869 --> 18:24.280
And...

18:24.337 --> 18:27.045
you look hot in that suit.

18:27.107 --> 18:29.053
When we get home later-

18:29.109 --> 18:31.089
Okay, you're actually gonna need to stop.

18:31.144 --> 18:33.146
This suit can't get any tighter.

18:33.213 --> 18:34.851
Hey, we're back.

18:34.914 --> 18:36.188
Nobody goes anywhere.

18:36.249 --> 18:38.855
Everybody hold hands,
and we go right to the table.

18:38.918 --> 18:42.491
- Fiona?
- Actually, we just gave away your table.

18:42.555 --> 18:44.364
I'm sorry, but I did warn you about this.

18:44.424 --> 18:46.097
Listen to me, Fiorina.

18:46.159 --> 18:50.005
This man has been waiting to eat
in this restaurant for months!

18:50.063 --> 18:52.600
We were all selfish, and we made him late.

18:52.665 --> 18:55.271
And maybe I got a little crazy,
but I'm gonna think about that later.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.542
But he has done nothing wrong.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.174
So we're not gonna leave this place...

18:59.239 --> 19:03.210
until he eats that drunk cow
that he can't shut up his mouth about!

19:05.011 --> 19:06.786
Why you haven't move?

19:06.846 --> 19:09.850
Last night, I had the greatest meal
I've ever had.

19:09.916 --> 19:14.797
And it never would have happened if Gloria hadn't
got us kicked out of that snooty restaurant.

19:17.557 --> 19:18.627
Tacos.

19:19.792 --> 19:22.102
- Tacos, yes.
- I need a taco.

19:22.162 --> 19:23.266
Taco truck!

19:27.467 --> 19:29.640
- Mmm!
- That is delicious.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.978
No, but seriously, who looks better?

19:32.038 --> 19:35.485
I don't know if it was
the six scotches I drank..

19:35.542 --> 19:39.080
Waiting for everybody, or the fact that
I hadn't eaten anything since breakfast...

19:39.145 --> 19:42.490
or the moment Phil's suit finally gave up.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.625
They even played my favorite song

19:46.686 --> 19:48.393
♪ He's leaving ♪

19:48.454 --> 19:50.661
♪ Leaving ♪

19:50.723 --> 19:52.669

19:52.725 --> 19:55.331

19:56.996 --> 19:59.602

19:59.666 --> 20:03.876

20:03.937 --> 20:06.076

20:11.044 --> 20:13.820

20:13.880 --> 20:18.420
A train I'd never make
00.

20:18.484 --> 20:20.896
♪ I'd rather live in his world ♪

20:21.921 --> 20:24.333
♪ Than be without him in mine ♪♪

20:28.194 --> 20:29.696
Here you go.

20:29.762 --> 20:32.299
I didn't know what you wanted to drink,
so I just got you this soda.

20:32.365 --> 20:34.038
Oh, that's fine. Thank you.

20:36.269 --> 20:40.877
- Cam, what did you do?
- I did exactly what you did, because I know you so well.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.317
I didn't shake the soda.

20:42.375 --> 20:46.016
Then you have nothing to worry about,
so go ahead and open it.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.995
I shook it, okay?
I shook the soda. I shook it up!

20:52.051 --> 20:53.291
Are you happy?

20:53.353 --> 20:55.458
It was petty and stupid
and awful. I'm sorry.

20:56.656 --> 20:58.693
Damn it.

21:00.260 --> 21:01.705
Ah!
