02:12.925 --> 02:15.052
It is important to get this guy on tape.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.428
Be extremely careful.

02:16.512 --> 02:17.513
Ganzo.

02:19.223 --> 02:21.642
Ganzo. Ganzo! I should have a gun!

02:22.392 --> 02:23.435
No. You're not a cop.

02:26.772 --> 02:28.232
Zuchi, give me a gun.

02:28.315 --> 02:29.691
How about I give you a bullet.

02:32.569 --> 02:34.530
Button your shirt. Your guest is arriving.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.242
Shit.

02:38.325 --> 02:39.952
You owe me for this.

02:43.413 --> 02:44.248
Don't screw up.

02:57.970 --> 02:58.971
Tenzin!

02:59.721 --> 03:01.431
My friend. Please join me.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.857
Are you ready for some tasty dishes?

03:32.421 --> 03:33.380
Sorry.

03:38.552 --> 03:39.386
Where is Serik?

03:42.639 --> 03:44.016
He has been sent to America.

03:44.725 --> 03:45.726
On a little errand.

03:46.852 --> 03:47.686
Why?

03:48.312 --> 03:50.022
Is my company not good enough for you?

03:50.689 --> 03:53.775
Ah, come on!
I'm happy to do business with you.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.696
It's good to see
you moving up in the ranks.

03:59.781 --> 04:02.075
Sir, can you please turn down the radio?

04:02.159 --> 04:02.993
No!

04:03.493 --> 04:04.870
I like this song.

04:08.207 --> 04:09.166
I've fed you.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.543
What did you bring me?

04:21.053 --> 04:24.348
Whoa, look at this!

04:52.960 --> 04:53.794
Let's drink!

04:58.507 --> 04:59.341
Give me that.

05:12.020 --> 05:12.855
To your health.

05:13.856 --> 05:14.731
To your health.

05:19.403 --> 05:21.655
Now, what else can I do
to keep your miners going?

05:25.701 --> 05:27.578
They get lonely down in their holes.

05:28.871 --> 05:29.705
Sure thing.

05:30.581 --> 05:31.456
Let's see.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.294
I may have a few

05:35.961 --> 05:36.962
young,

05:37.045 --> 05:37.921
pretty...

05:38.881 --> 05:40.382
Mongolian girls.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.137
You like that?

05:48.307 --> 05:49.933
I was exactly looking for...

05:51.351 --> 05:52.394
a couple of young...

05:53.228 --> 05:54.813
pretty Mongolian girls.

05:58.901 --> 06:00.736
Maybe you can introduce them to me?

06:03.906 --> 06:05.032
Hey!

06:05.115 --> 06:05.991
What's this?

06:11.580 --> 06:14.041
Tenzin, it's not what it looks like!

06:14.124 --> 06:15.334
My friend, please!

06:17.419 --> 06:19.129
Freeze! Freeze!

06:19.213 --> 06:20.672
Don't move!

06:20.756 --> 06:22.799
- We will shoot!
- Drop your weapon!

06:22.883 --> 06:24.593
Fuck you! I'll kill her!

06:25.260 --> 06:26.470
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:26.553 --> 06:28.514
Gentlemen, be calm, be calm!

06:29.014 --> 06:29.848
Okay, gentlemen.

06:30.849 --> 06:31.683
Okay.

06:31.767 --> 06:32.768
Everything is okay.

06:33.352 --> 06:34.186
We're leaving.

06:34.811 --> 06:35.646
We're leaving.

06:42.528 --> 06:43.779
Die, bitch!

08:04.249 --> 08:06.552
Nice car, lieutenant Starsky.

08:06.584 --> 08:07.786
Starsky drove a Torino.

08:13.625 --> 08:15.995
You've got to keep it
together here, man.

08:16.028 --> 08:18.865
- This is an important one.
- They're all important ones.

08:22.067 --> 08:23.502
How long
have you been under?

08:24.603 --> 08:25.504
Long enough.

08:26.838 --> 08:27.539
Wade.

08:30.074 --> 08:33.812
- 23 days.
- And Hannah?

08:33.845 --> 08:36.515
Hannah is always on shore
and I'm always out at sea.

08:39.784 --> 08:42.053
Alright.
Let's get this thing done.

08:44.889 --> 08:47.091
Yeah,
push the button on the side.

08:47.125 --> 08:49.695
Now, anyone checking that, they're
going to think you forgot to charge.

08:49.727 --> 08:52.330
But it's always on.
It's always recording.

08:52.364 --> 08:55.935
Look, we need you to get this guy,
Jin, on tape talking about trafficking.

08:55.967 --> 08:57.802
Talking about
intent to traffic again.

08:58.836 --> 09:01.105
When you say the safe word,
we're going to rain down

09:01.139 --> 09:03.308
on that place with
every kind of hell we have.

09:07.946 --> 09:11.149
Yeah, that's your contact.
That's Jin.

09:11.182 --> 09:13.718
And look, this guy, he can seem
like your best friend.

09:13.751 --> 09:17.121
But man, he can change
on a dime. So just watch him.

09:17.154 --> 09:18.124
Got it.

09:19.057 --> 09:21.092
Yeah, those are
trafficked girls.

09:21.994 --> 09:23.362
Jin and his gang,
they lie to them.

09:23.394 --> 09:25.029
Promise them jobs,

09:25.062 --> 09:27.665
free tuition
to Western universities.

09:27.698 --> 09:31.269
Then they take their passports, and boom,
they're stuck. Some of them never go home.

09:34.905 --> 09:36.307
And who is the spook?

09:36.341 --> 09:38.177
We don't know yet.

09:38.210 --> 09:40.679
Kind of showed up recently.
We think he's senior management.

09:40.711 --> 09:42.181
Maybe he's here to reign in Jin.

09:42.214 --> 09:44.083
It seems them two have
some kind of beef.

09:44.115 --> 09:47.086
- So maybe you can use that, or something.
- Great.

09:48.120 --> 09:52.256
And how are the local authorities are
out here? Are they... they're cool?

09:52.289 --> 09:56.160
Eh... they can be
a little overzealous.

09:56.193 --> 09:57.228
Shit.

09:57.261 --> 09:58.163
Yeah.

09:58.964 --> 10:00.165
So, are we
arresting you tonight?

10:00.197 --> 10:01.899
Yeah, stick with the plan.

10:01.932 --> 10:03.769
I've got too much invested
in this Preston character

10:03.802 --> 10:04.736
to burn him out.

10:09.073 --> 10:09.975
Shit.

10:11.275 --> 10:12.177
We're close.

11:41.899 --> 11:44.836
I'm supposed to meet Jin.
Is he here?

11:49.039 --> 11:51.476
Jin sends his apologies.
He cannot meet today.

11:53.311 --> 11:54.846
Well...

11:54.879 --> 11:56.347
you look like a man who
wants to talk business.

11:56.380 --> 11:58.116
I'm here, so...

11:58.149 --> 11:59.184
let's talk business.

12:05.056 --> 12:06.358
What I offer is access.

12:06.390 --> 12:08.192
Safe access
to the rich businessmen

12:08.225 --> 12:09.394
that stay at my casino.

12:10.729 --> 12:14.365
Think of me as a concierge for
the shit that you really want.

12:14.399 --> 12:17.336
The shit that you can't ask
a real concierge for.

12:17.369 --> 12:18.269
You mind if I smoke?

12:19.448 --> 12:23.869
He says he has rich customers
for you at his casino.

12:25.442 --> 12:27.913
That's the beauty
of this arrangement.

12:27.946 --> 12:31.048
My clients are willing to pay
for the discretion that I offer.

12:31.081 --> 12:34.986
What I can do for you is walk your
product from the loading dock,

12:35.019 --> 12:38.356
into the service elevator,
directly in to my clients' room.

12:38.389 --> 12:41.492
I take a fee and it's not cheap.
But I spread it around a bit.

12:41.525 --> 12:43.361
And the cops get a cut.

12:43.394 --> 12:45.163
The important thing
is you get your share,

12:46.063 --> 12:47.332
without the overhead and risk.

12:49.853 --> 12:52.064
He can get girls into the casino secretly,

12:52.147 --> 12:53.482
through the back doors.

12:53.565 --> 12:55.317
And he bribes the cops.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.360
He wants a cut.

12:58.362 --> 12:59.738
But he'll carry the risk.

13:00.906 --> 13:02.199
Once this asshole shuts up.

13:03.075 --> 13:04.493
Pack your things quickly.

13:05.244 --> 13:06.370
We have to go.

13:11.625 --> 13:12.459
Get over there.

13:26.098 --> 13:27.266
Get down! Down!

13:28.874 --> 13:32.010
Down! Get down! Get your
hands where I can fucking see them!

13:32.977 --> 13:36.247
Get Your hands where
I can fucking see them!

13:36.280 --> 13:39.183
- Put your hands up!
- He doesn't speak...

13:39.216 --> 13:42.321
Shut up. Get your hands where
I can fucking see them.

13:42.354 --> 13:45.157
Into the wall. Turn around!
Turn around!

13:45.190 --> 13:47.159
Turn around now, motherfucker.
Turn around!

13:48.659 --> 13:52.029
He doesn't speak English!
Can you fucking quit...

13:52.062 --> 13:54.600
I told you to shut the fuck up!

14:42.080 --> 14:43.249
No!

15:03.368 --> 15:04.937
You screwed me, man!

15:04.970 --> 15:06.404
What the fuck was that, Troy?

15:06.437 --> 15:08.240
Why did SWAT breach?
I didn't have anything!

15:08.273 --> 15:10.576
Calm down! I can explain.

15:14.611 --> 15:16.447
That's why.
That's our friend Jin.

15:18.682 --> 15:19.617
Where is the rest of him?

15:27.993 --> 15:28.694
Shit.

15:30.061 --> 15:31.330
Let's go.

15:55.586 --> 15:57.188
What's this?

15:57.221 --> 16:00.491
Uh, that is a boarding pass?
Economy plus.

16:00.524 --> 16:02.760
- Pretty good.
- Don't say I never did anything for you.

16:02.793 --> 16:04.696
Cool. Why is my name on it?

16:04.729 --> 16:07.365
You are the lead on this task force.
You made the collar.

16:07.399 --> 16:12.337
So you will be accompanying
Mr. Serik Ibriajev to Mongolia.

16:13.303 --> 16:14.206
Mongolia?

16:16.140 --> 16:18.743
Uh, that collar
was made here in Texas,

16:18.777 --> 16:22.514
where I watched him carve
through an entire SWAT team.

16:22.547 --> 16:24.649
Whether it was dumb luck
or divine fiat,

16:25.549 --> 16:28.586
you made one hell
of an arrest last night, Wade.

16:28.620 --> 16:30.755
This Serik guy...

16:30.788 --> 16:34.259
he is an operative for an international
crime syndicate out of Mongolia.

16:35.192 --> 16:40.532
These guys are into illegal gold
mines, drugs, protection rackets.

16:40.565 --> 16:43.669
And most recently,
human sex trafficking.

16:44.735 --> 16:49.040
The Mongolians think that they can get
our friend Serik to turn state's evidence.

16:49.807 --> 16:52.110
So get a Marshall to do it,
that's what they're there for.

16:52.143 --> 16:56.581
I mean, sending me to Mongolia,
that's.. that's bullshit.

16:58.482 --> 17:00.718
- Troy, would you close the door please.
- Sure.

17:00.751 --> 17:02.387
With you
on the other side of it.

17:09.294 --> 17:11.096
Okay.

17:11.127 --> 17:12.363
Let's talk about bullshit.

17:14.566 --> 17:15.634
You left these at the scene.

17:17.233 --> 17:19.404
They must have fallen out
of your pimp costume.

17:20.637 --> 17:25.376
Now I have to explain to IA how your
fucking drugs ended up in chain of custody.

17:27.144 --> 17:29.713
Why don't you explain them
that I was a little preoccupied

17:29.747 --> 17:31.416
with the whole violent,
bloody mayhem thing.

17:31.449 --> 17:32.451
These are pain killers.

17:33.484 --> 17:35.286
Your injury was 9 months ago.

17:38.123 --> 17:41.326
Look, you had a shitty year,
Wade, I get it.

17:41.358 --> 17:44.262
- Yeah.
- But you are too young to be washed up.

17:45.797 --> 17:47.766
You made a good pull last night.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.602
Now go get your head together.

17:59.243 --> 18:01.480
- What about the girl?
- She goes too.

18:02.513 --> 18:04.682
The other girls
are going to ICE.

18:04.715 --> 18:07.451
Oh, fuck those guys! What are you
trying to accomplish here, Pierce?

18:07.484 --> 18:10.788
I'm picking my battles.
You'd be wise to do the same.

18:10.821 --> 18:12.656
Why is she in handcuffs?

18:12.690 --> 18:14.292
Because she's a criminal, Wade.

18:14.325 --> 18:15.759
She is a victim.

18:15.792 --> 18:17.862
Do you know how many
of these trafficked women

18:17.895 --> 18:19.397
become traffickers themselves?

18:20.865 --> 18:22.433
Anyway, you're taking her home.

18:24.234 --> 18:26.837
You'll be meeting a Detective
Ganzorig for the hand off.

18:37.648 --> 18:38.549
Work.

18:39.817 --> 18:40.885
Right. Let's go.

18:56.929 --> 18:59.056
Tomorrow we will arrest
Arslan at his casino.

18:59.723 --> 19:01.433
Per an agreement with his attorney,

19:01.517 --> 19:03.602
he is surrendering himself to our custody.

19:04.520 --> 19:05.729
This is not good news.

19:06.563 --> 19:08.899
Arslan will be laughing
when we put the cuffs on him.

19:09.691 --> 19:13.695
He is making fools of us because of you.

19:14.613 --> 19:15.948
How has it come to this?

19:16.031 --> 19:17.407
Take some responsibility!

19:17.908 --> 19:20.452
You two made a great mistake yesterday.

19:21.078 --> 19:22.913
He is toying with us.

19:23.539 --> 19:27.584
Arslan knows you failed
to arrest his enforcer.

19:28.210 --> 19:30.003
Without a witness, the case dies.

19:31.213 --> 19:32.047
However...

19:33.298 --> 19:35.217
there is one thing Arslan doesn't know.

19:36.260 --> 19:41.431
The American FBI
and the Mongolian National Police

19:42.891 --> 19:46.895
have just arrested
Arslan's other top enforcer.

19:46.979 --> 19:48.230
Serik Ibrayev.

19:49.064 --> 19:52.442
He is on a flight to UB as we speak.

19:52.943 --> 19:55.112
In the custody
of an American special agent.

19:55.195 --> 19:56.071
Serik arrives at dawn.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.450
We have just 48 hours
to secure a conviction.

20:01.201 --> 20:02.661
Deliver the witness to court.

20:03.161 --> 20:05.581
Or we will lose Arslan

20:05.664 --> 20:06.790
probably forever.

20:08.166 --> 20:10.711
You will be coordinating
with Commander Khadaan.

20:10.794 --> 20:12.671
- You can go now.
- Yes, sir.

20:21.818 --> 20:22.788
Detective.

20:23.788 --> 20:24.990
Detective Ganzorig.

20:25.022 --> 20:26.625
Nice to meet you, Wade Dalton.

20:41.972 --> 20:42.874
Shit.

20:47.077 --> 20:48.346
Yeah, sorry.

20:49.480 --> 20:52.384
Do you want me to drive
since I'm already... No? Okay.

21:42.386 --> 21:43.387
How was your trip?

21:44.179 --> 21:45.013
Quite good.

21:46.139 --> 21:46.974
Good.

21:50.102 --> 21:52.187
How many days did it take to produce that?

21:54.565 --> 21:55.607
About seven days.

21:56.108 --> 21:58.110
How many? About seven days?

22:00.946 --> 22:01.780
Thirteen days.

22:04.324 --> 22:05.158
How many?

22:07.411 --> 22:08.370
Why did it take so long?

22:27.848 --> 22:28.891
This is an old mine.

22:31.310 --> 22:32.853
It's getting harder to mine gold.

22:34.855 --> 22:37.900
There is a legal mine opening nearby,

22:38.817 --> 22:39.943
with higher pay.

22:42.321 --> 22:45.073
Rumor has it
our employees want to go there.

22:46.533 --> 22:50.329
Well, it means there's something that
our employees aren't happy with.

22:51.205 --> 22:53.040
How was your lunch meeting yesterday?

22:55.751 --> 22:56.585
Tell me.

22:57.544 --> 22:59.129
I want to know everything.

22:59.880 --> 23:02.633
That sob Erdene was working for the cops.

23:04.176 --> 23:05.135
He betrayed us.

23:07.221 --> 23:08.305
He was wearing a wire.

23:08.722 --> 23:10.849
This hole is dry!

23:11.517 --> 23:14.186
There's nothing here.
Not even the smell of gold!

23:21.818 --> 23:24.488
The Russians already took
all the gold that was here.

23:25.614 --> 23:27.741
We should dig somewhere else.

23:33.664 --> 23:37.918
The Russians left because
their empire collapsed,

23:38.001 --> 23:40.546
not because Mongolia is out of gold.

23:40.629 --> 23:42.214
What do you know of Mongolia?

23:42.798 --> 23:43.841
You are a foreigner!

23:44.508 --> 23:50.806
My ancestors roamed these
lands for 500 years.

23:50.889 --> 23:52.307
That is ancient history!

23:53.475 --> 23:54.351
Look around!

23:57.354 --> 23:58.313
This is not Mongolia.

23:59.147 --> 24:00.899
This is my land now.

24:00.983 --> 24:03.193
You are the foreigner here.

24:04.319 --> 24:06.280
Now, crawl back in your hole and dig.

24:07.906 --> 24:08.740
Dig!

24:10.450 --> 24:11.285
Let me go.

24:11.952 --> 24:13.245
Let me go!

24:19.126 --> 24:21.378
The old man says the hole is dry?

24:21.461 --> 24:23.422
Let's stop wasting our time and efforts.

24:23.505 --> 24:24.423
Fill it in.

24:25.424 --> 24:26.258
Now!

24:27.968 --> 24:29.344
Why are you standing still?

24:30.470 --> 24:32.347
- Quickly.
- Quickly fill in the hole!

24:33.265 --> 24:34.099
Hurry up!

26:05.028 --> 26:06.064
Khulan!

26:17.907 --> 26:18.809
I'm sorry.

26:22.779 --> 26:24.281
I thought...

26:24.315 --> 26:25.283
Well, that woke me up.

26:28.752 --> 26:30.621
Probably shouldn't
have snuck up on you, huh?

26:32.189 --> 26:34.058
No, just stay there.

26:46.971 --> 26:47.939
Are you okay?

26:48.873 --> 26:49.941
Could use a drink.

26:56.146 --> 27:01.251
Look, I can't sleep, it's like 10 a.m. in
east Texas, so you'd be doing me a favor.

27:04.221 --> 27:05.957
I promise
I won't interrogate you.

27:18.201 --> 27:19.304
This guy is really good, right?

27:20.871 --> 27:22.107
I think he's in the wrong key.

27:23.240 --> 27:26.110
Yes, I also think he's
in the wrong key. I knew that.

27:27.077 --> 27:30.048
- Pour yourself one, please. Thank you.
- Thank you.

27:33.349 --> 27:34.952
I used to want to do this.

27:36.086 --> 27:36.988
Sing badly?

27:38.154 --> 27:40.191
No. You wanted to be a singer?

27:40.223 --> 27:43.293
Actually I was, uh, when I was a
little girl, that was my dream.

27:46.896 --> 27:47.965
That's how they tricked me.

27:49.200 --> 27:50.867
The traffickers.

27:50.901 --> 27:52.103
And they told me that...

27:53.837 --> 27:57.241
"Oh, you're going to perform for rich people
at the hotels in Chicago and Las Vegas."

27:58.509 --> 27:59.711
And I believed them.

28:01.077 --> 28:01.980
I was so dumb.

28:02.880 --> 28:03.782
You're not dumb.

28:05.115 --> 28:06.050
Maybe I'm not.

28:07.884 --> 28:08.952
But they are smarter.

28:10.421 --> 28:12.990
What about Serik?
Is that, is that what he does?

28:14.525 --> 28:15.993
You said you weren't going to.

28:16.026 --> 28:17.195
Right, sorry.

28:18.828 --> 28:19.864
Occupational habit.

28:22.932 --> 28:26.805
So do you, um... you have
a place to stay tonight?

28:28.439 --> 28:33.745
My friend, she is in Korea with her boyfriend,
so I can stay there until they return.

28:34.778 --> 28:36.247
And then? Home?

28:38.281 --> 28:40.784
My family knew
a different person.

28:40.817 --> 28:44.756
I would rather
they remember me the way I was.

28:46.222 --> 28:46.923
Without the shame.

28:50.994 --> 28:52.296
I think I can't go back home.

28:53.358 --> 28:54.193
Hey.

28:55.068 --> 28:56.570
I remember you.

28:58.947 --> 29:00.365
Your name is Jessica.

29:03.493 --> 29:05.078
Are you still doing the same thing?

29:05.954 --> 29:07.873
I have a room upstairs.

29:08.278 --> 29:09.913
What does he want?
What is he saying?

29:09.946 --> 29:10.914
Sorry.

29:11.043 --> 29:12.586
Sorry. Sir, I think you've had enough.

29:12.669 --> 29:15.088
- Let me call you a taxi...
- You, shut the fuck up.

29:19.009 --> 29:20.969
What are you doing with this foreigner?

29:22.262 --> 29:23.597
Come here, whore.

29:24.181 --> 29:25.516
Please stop this.

29:26.016 --> 29:27.518
My friend and I are talking.

29:27.601 --> 29:28.852
You think he's your friend?

29:30.395 --> 29:31.271
Silly bitch.

29:31.868 --> 29:33.236
What is he saying?

29:33.269 --> 29:34.972
He says you are not her friend.

29:37.141 --> 29:39.144
And... some other stuff too.

29:40.277 --> 29:41.179
I bet he did.

29:43.450 --> 29:44.535
She's a whore.

29:46.383 --> 29:48.286
Hey! Tell him,
tell him for me, please.

29:48.318 --> 29:50.387
Come here! I want
to buy you a drink. Come here.

29:50.421 --> 29:51.389
Tell him that, yeah.

29:51.583 --> 29:52.918
He wants to buy you a drink.

29:53.001 --> 29:53.836
Him?

29:54.795 --> 29:56.296
A beer is a beer!

29:59.508 --> 30:03.178
How many dollars does it take
to make your thighs wet?

30:04.388 --> 30:05.222
Hmm?

30:06.237 --> 30:07.138
Hey.

30:08.338 --> 30:09.240
Drink is ready.

30:20.904 --> 30:22.865
I want to make an official complaint!

30:22.948 --> 30:24.449
That blonde man tried to kill me!

30:26.910 --> 30:28.161
The problem is...

30:30.038 --> 30:30.873
Good evening.

30:32.958 --> 30:33.959
What happened here?

30:35.043 --> 30:37.588
You see, that man had too much to drink.

30:37.671 --> 30:39.006
I asked him to leave.

30:40.757 --> 30:41.967
He refused.

30:44.974 --> 30:45.876
What he said.

30:53.517 --> 30:54.485
You are making trouble.

30:56.319 --> 30:58.088
Well, to be fair, he started it.

30:59.355 --> 31:00.858
You are FBI agent.

31:02.393 --> 31:04.194
What are you doing
with that hooker?

31:06.396 --> 31:08.465
Do you want to save all of them?

31:08.499 --> 31:12.169
You can go to Macau,
there is more than 3,000.

31:12.201 --> 31:13.904
What's wrong
with just saving one?

31:15.138 --> 31:16.406
That's my job.

31:16.440 --> 31:18.142
But you weren't doing it, I was.

31:21.345 --> 31:22.247
Have a good night.

31:27.012 --> 31:30.390
So... what do you think of these rookies?

31:32.976 --> 31:34.478
They look like children.

31:36.396 --> 31:37.981
I selected them personally.

31:38.440 --> 31:42.653
Eager, principled,
the elite of their class.

31:43.487 --> 31:48.116
Most importantly,
I know they're not corrupt.

31:48.200 --> 31:50.827
Because they've never seen
the inside of this station.

31:52.663 --> 31:54.665
Any new leads on the mole?

31:57.918 --> 31:58.919
Be patient.

32:00.921 --> 32:02.422
The investigation is ongoing.

32:05.300 --> 32:06.134
As you know...

32:07.970 --> 32:10.472
these things take time.

32:15.394 --> 32:16.854
But do we have any?

32:18.230 --> 32:19.231
The courthouse...

32:21.108 --> 32:23.110
is three kilometers east of here.

32:25.112 --> 32:26.738
It will not be an easy trip.

32:27.739 --> 32:28.866
You better be prepared.

32:31.034 --> 32:32.035
I have a plan.

32:49.799 --> 32:51.402
Agent Wade,

32:51.434 --> 32:52.336
You are with me.

33:29.134 --> 33:30.844
I believe this is what you asked for.

33:33.347 --> 33:34.681
Yes, this will do.

33:35.766 --> 33:37.226
- Thank you.
- Of course.

33:43.690 --> 33:45.317
You must always be alert.

33:45.400 --> 33:47.819
The most dangerous point
is Jamiyangun street.

33:50.489 --> 33:52.491
We may run into strong resistance.

33:52.574 --> 33:57.079
But I'm confident
you are all up to the task.

33:57.496 --> 33:58.622
Get him out.

34:03.919 --> 34:04.753
Out.

34:09.716 --> 34:11.009
I need a volunteer.

34:11.092 --> 34:13.219
Unmarried. No kids. Trained.

34:13.846 --> 34:15.764
- Height?
- 180 centimenters tall.

34:16.348 --> 34:17.724
180 centimenters tall.

34:18.308 --> 34:19.643
Sir, I volunteer.

34:20.768 --> 34:21.603
I am ready.

34:24.982 --> 34:26.859
I'm 178 centimeters.

34:28.318 --> 34:29.902
No. Look at your belly.

34:30.487 --> 34:31.737
He will be killed.

34:32.322 --> 34:33.614
These rookies are too young.

34:33.699 --> 34:35.534
You need a seasoned cop in that convoy.

34:35.951 --> 34:38.745
They won't know
what to do if there's trouble.

34:47.170 --> 34:48.005
Stand down.

34:58.265 --> 35:01.602
Detective, your fat partner
doesn't look anything like me.

35:02.269 --> 35:05.189
Yeah, well, no women were available.

35:09.306 --> 35:10.641
I think I understood that.

35:17.326 --> 35:18.577
You're making a mistake.

35:19.703 --> 35:20.787
Your people will die.

35:21.705 --> 35:23.916
Leave that asshole
here with those suckers.

35:23.999 --> 35:25.375
Send me out with one officer.

35:26.376 --> 35:27.419
When my people come...

35:28.504 --> 35:30.088
I'll keep him safe.

35:38.138 --> 35:39.348
You're a fucking criminal.

35:40.891 --> 35:42.559
You're telling me how to do my job?

35:44.394 --> 35:45.229
Go ahead.

35:57.908 --> 35:58.742
Everyone move out.

35:58.825 --> 35:59.743
Let's go!

36:01.757 --> 36:03.193
- Wade.
- Yeah?

36:03.226 --> 36:04.327
You come with me.

38:22.666 --> 38:24.968
Hey, Ganz,
your decoy is working,

38:25.001 --> 38:27.505
let's stick to the plan
and take this asshole to court.

38:27.683 --> 38:29.768
It makes no difference, Detective.

38:29.852 --> 38:31.436
I'll never testify.

38:31.520 --> 38:32.813
You should go save your friends.

38:40.083 --> 38:42.686
Wait for me. Don't go anywhere.

39:14.751 --> 39:15.653
Take the key.

39:16.585 --> 39:18.588
Take the key. Unlock that cuff.

39:19.889 --> 39:21.092
Unlock the cuff.

39:24.494 --> 39:25.563
Come on, come on.

39:30.434 --> 39:31.902
Now, I know
you can't understand me,

39:31.934 --> 39:33.836
and I don't really care,
but if you step one foot

39:33.869 --> 39:35.972
out of this taxi, I'm going to
shoot you in your pretty face.

40:44.695 --> 40:45.529
Hey!

40:45.612 --> 40:46.613
Comrads!

40:46.697 --> 40:47.739
Comrads!

40:47.823 --> 40:49.491
I'm over here!

40:50.242 --> 40:51.118
Serik!

40:51.201 --> 40:52.077
Serik!

40:56.331 --> 40:58.000
Go! Go!

41:12.806 --> 41:13.765
That's not him!

41:17.144 --> 41:18.979
- I don't know...
- Where is Serik?

41:19.938 --> 41:22.357
You motherfucker! Hey!

41:39.082 --> 41:39.958
Call an ambulance!

41:40.959 --> 41:41.877
Call an ambulance!

41:48.759 --> 41:52.221
Did you see that bastard's face?

41:52.304 --> 41:53.388
He thought I was Serik.

41:53.972 --> 41:55.390
Yeah, you had everyone fooled.

41:57.017 --> 41:58.977
I was going to wear a vest.

41:59.061 --> 42:01.730
But it would have made me even fatter.

42:03.857 --> 42:04.691
Gonzo.

42:06.151 --> 42:07.027
I'm thirsty.

42:09.196 --> 42:10.197
Get water.

43:26.106 --> 43:28.066
Don't go to the courthouse.

43:28.150 --> 43:30.360
Head to the safehouse
and wait for my call.

43:52.883 --> 43:53.717
Detective...

43:54.259 --> 43:55.719
I warned you.

44:04.407 --> 44:05.976
Whoa, Ganz!

44:11.313 --> 44:12.882
Ganz!

44:12.916 --> 44:13.817
Whoa!

44:15.351 --> 44:16.787
Whoa, Whoa, woah! Ganz!

44:18.153 --> 44:19.956
Put the gun down, Ganz!
Look at me.

44:19.989 --> 44:21.824
Put the gun down.
You do not want to do this.

44:21.858 --> 44:23.360
Shut the fuck up.

44:23.393 --> 44:25.095
I don't want to shoot you, Ganz.

44:25.128 --> 44:27.364
- Put the gun down!
- Get back in the fucking car!

44:27.396 --> 44:31.434
I saw what they did to Borgil.
So did he, he knows he's alone.

44:32.367 --> 44:34.438
All he's got left is to testify.

44:34.471 --> 44:35.873
Go back to your America.

44:36.873 --> 44:38.775
Tell them we are all crazy here!

44:39.509 --> 44:40.711
This is not your battle.

44:41.978 --> 44:42.945
Okay, hey.

44:44.313 --> 44:46.349
I don't speak your language so I
don't know how to talk you down.

44:48.083 --> 44:49.819
But if you do this, Ganz...

44:51.954 --> 44:53.989
then Borgil died for nothing.

44:54.023 --> 44:55.358
You can't come back from this.

44:57.226 --> 44:58.795
So let's take him
to court, yeah?

45:10.340 --> 45:11.240
Get in the fucking car.

46:10.729 --> 46:11.772
Okay.

46:11.855 --> 46:14.983
Leave them there
and come see me on the hill.

46:15.901 --> 46:16.902
Understood?

46:16.985 --> 46:17.819
Yeah.

46:18.570 --> 46:19.404
On my way.

46:20.510 --> 46:22.412
Wade, you stay here.

46:22.445 --> 46:25.048
- Watch him.
- Why? Are you going somewhere?

46:28.284 --> 46:29.186
Ganz, I don't...

46:37.589 --> 46:38.799
This is fucking insane.

48:05.886 --> 48:07.304
Arslan, it's time.

48:07.888 --> 48:08.722
They're here.

48:09.348 --> 48:10.974
Shall we continue this later?

48:13.852 --> 48:14.770
I'll be back.

48:14.853 --> 48:16.146
Bring more money next time.

48:24.738 --> 48:25.864
Keep calm!

48:26.532 --> 48:27.616
I don't want this.

48:27.699 --> 48:29.076
Let's go! Let's go!

49:10.278 --> 49:11.447
What is it, Wade?

49:12.347 --> 49:13.317
<i>Shit, did I wake you?</i>

49:14.416 --> 49:15.518
Yeah, you did.

49:16.585 --> 49:19.054
It's late, really late.

49:19.088 --> 49:22.426
- Sorry. This fucking time change, I thought you might...
- <i>What do you want?</i>

49:24.327 --> 49:27.664
I just wanted to...
check on the dog.

49:28.731 --> 49:32.369
Buddy's okay.
He's chewing on himself again.

49:32.402 --> 49:34.137
Like bad.

49:34.170 --> 49:35.238
Wait, did you give me his meds?

49:37.273 --> 49:39.443
- No, I didn't.
- Why?

49:40.443 --> 49:42.579
I have them, which reminds me...

49:42.612 --> 49:45.048
Why do you have the dog's pills?

49:45.815 --> 49:50.220
Because Buddy and I are on
the same drug, for anxiety.

49:52.054 --> 49:53.289
I'll get straight, I just...

49:57.360 --> 49:58.260
I really miss you.

49:59.795 --> 50:00.696
Yeah?

50:01.597 --> 50:03.700
Is that the dog's
psych drugs talking?

50:03.733 --> 50:04.701
No.

50:06.501 --> 50:08.005
Can I see you when I get back?

50:09.771 --> 50:12.708
- Just come back safe.
- Yeah, okay, okay. I'll...

50:36.199 --> 50:39.635
Guess watching me is better than
anything on Russian TV, right?

50:40.869 --> 50:45.574
I got to admit, it feels good unloading
this all on a degenerate Russian pimp

50:45.608 --> 50:48.178
who buys and sells
women like they're nothing.

50:49.878 --> 50:53.382
That reminds me, how much did you pay
for that pretty translator of yours?

50:55.684 --> 51:00.356
Probably just won her in
some back alley cock fight in Kiev.

51:02.458 --> 51:04.461
Kiev is in Ukraine.

51:05.594 --> 51:09.765
Did your idiotic American schools
make you suck at geography?

51:09.798 --> 51:11.201
Or is that the drugs too?

51:18.306 --> 51:21.543
Fuck me.
You speak fucking English?

51:21.577 --> 51:24.681
Yes, I speak fucking English.

51:24.713 --> 51:27.483
Maybe fucking better
than you fucking do.

51:27.516 --> 51:30.586
And also I know
French, Mongolian and German.

51:30.619 --> 51:34.690
I was raised by a history professor and have
fondness for the French <i>nouvelle vague.</i>

51:35.724 --> 51:39.295
And also, I am not Russian.
I am Kazakh.

51:40.262 --> 51:42.731
Do you know
anything about anything?

51:42.764 --> 51:46.769
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it.
You're Serik, the renaissance pimp.

52:30.943 --> 52:31.944
That's a lot of blood.

52:34.947 --> 52:35.864
It's not mine.

52:38.158 --> 52:39.993
Here. Put on some clean clothes.

52:41.995 --> 52:43.330
A fat man makes an easy target.

52:44.998 --> 52:46.834
Even a blind man could hit Borghii.

52:51.421 --> 52:53.131
Sir, If you will arrange protection,

52:53.966 --> 52:55.425
I will get the Kazakh to court.

52:56.051 --> 52:59.555
There has been enough bloodshed today.

53:10.440 --> 53:13.527
Arslan's people did not
come to rescue Serik.

53:14.236 --> 53:15.654
They came to kill him.

53:15.737 --> 53:16.822
You don't get it.

53:16.905 --> 53:20.492
You have awakened a sleeping lion...

53:20.576 --> 53:22.828
Commander, my job is not done yet-

53:23.954 --> 53:24.788
That's enough.

53:26.915 --> 53:28.542
Go to the hospital now.

53:29.793 --> 53:31.170
Borghii is waiting for you.

53:32.880 --> 53:36.675
Leave Serik and the American to me.

53:37.843 --> 53:40.888
Tell me. What will Borghii
say when I see him?

53:42.472 --> 53:43.765
To be realistic.

53:44.808 --> 53:46.018
To let this one go.

53:47.936 --> 53:52.107
Your friend will tell you
to listen to your superior.

53:54.610 --> 53:56.195
The friend who died in my hands?

53:57.279 --> 53:58.113
Yes.

54:00.407 --> 54:02.659
The friend you left
bleeding in the street.

54:04.453 --> 54:07.706
Do you want to hear
what I think he would say?

54:09.291 --> 54:10.125
Go ahead.

54:10.709 --> 54:12.377
Blow his brains out.

54:13.587 --> 54:14.880
Tear him apart,

54:14.963 --> 54:16.757
and feed him to the fucking dogs!

54:19.927 --> 54:21.512
Hello. We are here for the prisoner.

54:22.657 --> 54:24.493
We are here for prisoner.

54:24.527 --> 54:25.394
Who sent you?

54:25.516 --> 54:26.850
Detective Ganzorig.

54:28.030 --> 54:29.298
Ganz.

54:29.331 --> 54:31.367
Ganz? Ganz sent you guys?

54:33.436 --> 54:34.336
Alright, hold on.

54:38.440 --> 54:41.510
Alright, moment of truth.
Your ride's here.

54:42.945 --> 54:45.715
Don't trust them.
They are bullshit cops.

54:45.748 --> 54:47.650
Bullshit cops? Yeah, how would
you know? Give me your wrist.

54:47.682 --> 54:49.318
U.B. cops don't knock.

54:51.086 --> 54:53.956
Okay! Give it a rest already!

54:53.989 --> 54:56.726
Hey! Detective said
to wait here.

54:56.759 --> 54:59.028
He said, "Open the door
to no one but me."

55:00.362 --> 55:02.597
Maybe that's what he said,
but I don't speak Mongolian.

55:02.630 --> 55:04.599
Want me to take
your word for it?

55:04.632 --> 55:07.971
Agent, undo the handcuffs right now.

55:10.606 --> 55:11.508
Eat a dick.

55:23.085 --> 55:25.387
Okay, we're going to wait
for Ganz to get back.

55:25.420 --> 55:27.756
He's going to come back,
we are going to wait for him. Understand?

55:28.120 --> 55:30.497
The American says
you should go back and wait

55:30.581 --> 55:32.416
in your cute little Prius.

55:33.417 --> 55:35.669
Maybe you can pass the time

55:35.752 --> 55:37.880
by sucking each other's dicks.

55:47.610 --> 55:48.811
That wasn't helpful.

55:48.844 --> 55:50.646
It was just a suggestion.

55:50.679 --> 55:53.483
What did you say? Look out!

56:53.909 --> 56:54.943
Check them for keys.

57:00.128 --> 57:01.547
Hey! What's happening?

57:01.630 --> 57:02.840
Answer me or we're coming in!

57:08.724 --> 57:09.626
Put the gun down.

57:10.525 --> 57:11.661
Put the gun down!

57:13.195 --> 57:15.532
More are coming. You need help.

57:26.029 --> 57:26.947
It's over.

57:27.614 --> 57:30.993
I'm going to see you buried,
you corrupt motherfucker!

57:31.827 --> 57:34.705
Do you really believe this ends with me?

57:35.372 --> 57:38.333
You are all alone. It's over.

57:39.126 --> 57:43.088
Even if we donâ€™t kill you,
do you know whoâ€™s who?

57:44.089 --> 57:45.257
Now run along.

57:45.883 --> 57:49.678
Time to dig graves for those two bastards.

58:25.034 --> 58:28.137
Fuck! Fuck!

58:28.170 --> 58:29.137
Drive! Drive! Drive!

58:47.021 --> 58:48.757
I can't reach it.

58:48.791 --> 58:49.993
Pull the brake. Now!

58:51.827 --> 58:52.729
Come on, first gear.

59:00.835 --> 59:01.736
Third! Third!

59:03.771 --> 59:05.842
Look out! Go, go around him.
Go around him.

59:10.211 --> 59:11.914
Fucking watch out for the truck.

59:13.014 --> 59:14.850
Where the fuck did
you learn to drive?

59:22.257 --> 59:23.358
I don't fucking speak Russian!

59:23.391 --> 59:24.793
Pull the fucking e-brake!

01:01:00.722 --> 01:01:01.423
You let him drive?

01:01:04.059 --> 01:01:05.827
Yeah, but his handcuffs
stayed on.

01:01:07.896 --> 01:01:08.965
Team effort.

01:02:51.099 --> 01:02:52.235
So, what's the plan?

01:02:53.335 --> 01:02:54.936
I don't know.

01:02:54.969 --> 01:02:57.839
We can't stay in U.B.
It's too dangerous.

01:02:59.373 --> 01:03:01.243
I know a place
we can go.

01:03:23.887 --> 01:03:25.389
It's not that bad in here.

01:03:30.185 --> 01:03:31.562
Almost like house arrest.

01:03:35.566 --> 01:03:40.946
The police are struggling to address
the recent surge in sex trafficking.

01:03:41.029 --> 01:03:48.036
Mongolia is a source
country for traffickers.

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:53.041
Young women are especially vulnerable
to the lies and of the traffickers.

01:03:53.125 --> 01:03:56.461
This year more than
one thousand women have gone

01:03:56.545 --> 01:03:59.423
missing from the city
and numbers are rising.

01:03:59.506 --> 01:04:02.551
Women are warned
against walking alone at night

01:04:02.634 --> 01:04:06.013
as violent abductions have been reported.

01:04:06.275 --> 01:04:08.344
My friends here
are from the underworld.

01:04:09.344 --> 01:04:10.947
They are not friends of Arslan.

01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:15.317
And they hate the Syndicate
more than you do.

01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:18.920
You are Syndicate.
Why would they trust you?

01:04:20.121 --> 01:04:25.193
Let's say I handle my business
in a different way than Tenzin.

01:04:39.379 --> 01:04:40.214
Brother.

01:04:47.179 --> 01:04:48.555
Weren't allowed entering US, huh?

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.475
Now US has come here

01:04:51.558 --> 01:04:53.054
and took me alone.

01:04:53.088 --> 01:04:53.990
CIA?

01:04:55.389 --> 01:04:56.291
FBI.

01:04:59.441 --> 01:05:02.152
Let's go over there. What happened?

01:05:02.778 --> 01:05:05.197
Look, I need to lay low for a while.

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:06.406
Who are these guys?

01:05:08.033 --> 01:05:10.327
Don't worry.
They're chasing something else.

01:05:10.869 --> 01:05:13.205
Hope you didn't bring the Syndicate here?

01:05:13.997 --> 01:05:16.792
I wouldn't ask you if I had someone alive.

01:06:30.518 --> 01:06:31.653
Shh!

01:06:33.452 --> 01:06:35.412
Serik thinks
he's the best in his business.

01:06:36.538 --> 01:06:39.291
But he forgot
the main rule of the salesman.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.878
Never sample your product.

01:06:43.337 --> 01:06:44.338
You might get hooked.

01:06:44.632 --> 01:06:46.201
No.

01:09:15.113 --> 01:09:15.948
Khulan?

01:10:36.445 --> 01:10:39.781
I told you, if you ran
I'd put a bullet in the back of your head.

01:10:40.449 --> 01:10:41.366
Are you running?

01:11:18.605 --> 01:11:20.041
Are you ready to testify now?

01:11:24.045 --> 01:11:26.347
Serik must appear
in the court tomorrow, noon.

01:11:29.083 --> 01:11:30.885
If we are late one minute...

01:11:32.619 --> 01:11:34.590
the judge will declare it
a mistrial.

01:11:35.689 --> 01:11:39.360
We are almost 30 kilometers
away from the city center.

01:11:40.694 --> 01:11:42.730
Arslan's men
will block the road.

01:11:44.466 --> 01:11:48.604
And they will stop every car
until they find us.

01:11:56.144 --> 01:11:57.346
What about Khulan?

01:12:16.086 --> 01:12:18.213
You have no idea who you're dealing with.

01:12:24.469 --> 01:12:25.637
Serik is fucking smart...

01:12:28.348 --> 01:12:30.267
with skills you can't comprehend.

01:12:35.439 --> 01:12:37.274
Arslan doesn't choose
his people at random.

01:12:39.067 --> 01:12:40.652
I am Serik's only equal.

01:12:46.074 --> 01:12:47.451
And if he decides

01:12:48.452 --> 01:12:49.453
to kill you...

01:12:56.376 --> 01:12:57.211
Or you...

01:12:59.671 --> 01:13:02.007
he will do it.

01:13:32.579 --> 01:13:34.998
Serik once ran in on some bastard...

01:13:36.041 --> 01:13:37.334
who was stealing our money.

01:13:39.503 --> 01:13:41.171
He whispered something in his ear...

01:13:43.006 --> 01:13:45.217
and that bastard cut his own throat.

01:14:40.314 --> 01:14:43.483
"SERIK'S NOT COMING
THEY ARE GOING TO THE TRAIN STATION"

01:14:45.944 --> 01:14:47.446
He was just trying to warn us

01:14:47.529 --> 01:14:48.697
that Serik will not come.

01:15:03.795 --> 01:15:04.796
He doesn't need you.

01:15:08.217 --> 01:15:09.551
Neither does your child!

01:15:27.611 --> 01:15:29.821
Our clients like pregnant women.

01:15:31.615 --> 01:15:32.699
They will like you.

01:15:37.955 --> 01:15:39.289
You two, stay with her.

01:15:39.748 --> 01:15:40.958
Watch her.

01:15:41.375 --> 01:15:42.918
You're as stupid as she is.

01:15:43.001 --> 01:15:44.169
All the rest, follow me.

01:15:59.153 --> 01:16:01.655
I hope you were right
about this.

01:16:01.689 --> 01:16:02.758
Yeah, I do too.

01:17:57.104 --> 01:17:58.072
Go!

01:18:00.138 --> 01:18:00.973
Run!

01:18:37.145 --> 01:18:38.913
Any chance they
didn't make it on the train?

01:18:38.945 --> 01:18:41.483
No chance,
because we brought them.

01:18:58.365 --> 01:19:00.935
Hey. Give me something.

01:19:01.903 --> 01:19:05.273
Anything, a weapon.
You know I can fight.

01:19:05.305 --> 01:19:09.510
No. We will fight.
You will testify.

01:19:09.543 --> 01:19:10.746
And go to jail.

01:19:38.471 --> 01:19:40.007
Come on! Front.

01:19:49.951 --> 01:19:50.985
I'm out!

01:22:58.738 --> 01:23:00.407
We haven't seen
Tenzin yet.

01:23:03.243 --> 01:23:04.478
Get rid of these handcuffs.

01:23:32.763 --> 01:23:33.722
Where is everybody?

01:23:35.766 --> 01:23:36.600
They're dead.

01:23:48.946 --> 01:23:49.780
Okay then.

01:23:52.157 --> 01:23:52.991
So, tell me.

01:23:54.159 --> 01:23:55.035
How are you doing?

01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:58.580
How did you lose your way?

01:24:01.458 --> 01:24:02.459
You left us...

01:24:04.628 --> 01:24:06.046
and found a woman...

01:24:08.590 --> 01:24:10.384
and now you're working with the cops.

01:24:12.094 --> 01:24:13.178
This is my own business.

01:24:19.518 --> 01:24:20.394
Did I offend you?

01:24:23.355 --> 01:24:26.733
I could have raped and killed her.

01:24:28.485 --> 01:24:30.070
You should be happy for her.

01:24:33.615 --> 01:24:35.284
I'll give you one last chance.

01:24:37.411 --> 01:24:38.245
Leave.

01:24:52.050 --> 01:24:53.594
If I go...

01:24:54.887 --> 01:24:56.221
what happens next?

01:25:00.767 --> 01:25:02.269
I will testify against Arslan.

01:25:10.819 --> 01:25:11.653
You know Serik...

01:25:13.363 --> 01:25:15.157
you always were a pussy.

01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:17.201
And it's just so disappointing.

01:25:18.577 --> 01:25:20.078
It's gonna kill you someday.

01:25:24.458 --> 01:25:25.501
You've got two options.

01:25:28.587 --> 01:25:29.421
The first.

01:25:31.089 --> 01:25:31.965
I kill you.

01:25:35.427 --> 01:25:36.261
The second.

01:25:39.848 --> 01:25:40.682
I kill you.

01:25:48.398 --> 01:25:49.608
I'll take the third.

01:26:15.592 --> 01:26:17.135
Just like old times, eh?

01:26:37.322 --> 01:26:38.156
Come on.

01:28:21.552 --> 01:28:22.469
Are you dying?

01:28:32.145 --> 01:28:32.980
No.

01:28:35.941 --> 01:28:36.859
But you are.

01:28:56.044 --> 01:28:57.546
Look at the mess we made.

01:29:07.139 --> 01:29:08.891
There's something stuck in your back.

01:29:20.027 --> 01:29:20.861
Sorry.

01:29:32.539 --> 01:29:33.540
See you soon, brother.

01:30:03.654 --> 01:30:05.489
I'm calling this court to order.

01:30:05.572 --> 01:30:08.450
The court acknowledges that
this is a high profile case.

01:30:08.534 --> 01:30:09.660
To be clear...

01:30:10.786 --> 01:30:16.583
This trial will be conducted
according to the law of Mongolia.

01:30:16.667 --> 01:30:17.918
And only by the law.

01:30:18.001 --> 01:30:20.212
Your Honor, excuse me.

01:30:21.046 --> 01:30:24.299
This has been a witch hunt
against my client from the beginning!

01:30:25.342 --> 01:30:28.971
Therefore, we request
the case to be dismissed!

01:30:29.054 --> 01:30:31.265
I would like to remind you
that the deadline

01:30:31.348 --> 01:30:34.601
for any new witness testimony is at noon.

01:30:34.685 --> 01:30:37.437
Your Honor, due to dangerous
and violent circumstances,

01:30:37.521 --> 01:30:39.398
our operation has been slowed down.

01:30:39.481 --> 01:30:42.818
There are still lives at risk as I speak.

01:30:43.652 --> 01:30:46.822
Yet, my men will bring
the witness to court.

01:30:46.905 --> 01:30:49.825
We've waited long enough.

01:30:49.908 --> 01:30:52.953
The prosecution has yet
to produce a single witness.

01:30:53.036 --> 01:30:56.331
You can't expect
my client to wait forever.

01:30:56.415 --> 01:30:58.817
We've filed our request to the judge.

01:32:59.672 --> 01:33:01.274
There are more
whores here than people.

01:33:06.412 --> 01:33:07.614
Here in the countryside?

01:33:09.882 --> 01:33:10.885
Here in my country.

01:33:24.730 --> 01:33:29.903
We are not used
to these sort of things here.

01:33:32.005 --> 01:33:34.875
The shootings, the mayhem.

01:33:38.811 --> 01:33:40.014
Do me a favor, Ganz.

01:33:44.016 --> 01:33:45.086
Don't ever get used to it.
