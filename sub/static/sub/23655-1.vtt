01:58.080 --> 02:00.913
- When did you start dancing?
- When I was 4.

02:01.040 --> 02:03.838
- Does your back hurt?
- No.

02:03.960 --> 02:06.235
- Have you had any operations?
- No.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.316
- Allergies?
- No.

02:08.479 --> 02:09.628
Get on the scale.

02:13.080 --> 02:14.479

02:18.400 --> 02:20.152
126 cm.

02:25.440 --> 02:26.793
63 cm.

02:26.920 --> 02:30.515
Stand at the barre
and wait until we call your name.

02:34.600 --> 02:36.113
Come on, come on.

02:43.160 --> 02:45.230
That's him, Bojinski.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.875
He's scary.

02:49.880 --> 02:51.677
He looks like a bogeyman.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.991
Xenia PIisiska.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.597
Come to the center of the room.

02:59.280 --> 03:02.590
Show us the sequence
two times, please.

03:02.720 --> 03:05.439
Tendu, fifth position.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.790
Tendu a la seconde, first position.

03:07.920 --> 03:09.399
Sauté, échappé.

03:09.520 --> 03:10.953
Three times, please.

03:11.080 --> 03:12.195
Go.

03:12.320 --> 03:14.038
And one and two...

03:24.840 --> 03:26.592
One, two...

03:34.400 --> 03:35.958
Polina Shanidze.

03:41.440 --> 03:43.271
Take your position.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.433
That's better.

03:49.200 --> 03:51.998
No. l said, tendu a la seconde.

03:52.440 --> 03:53.714
Start over.

03:56.280 --> 03:57.599
You're not listening.

04:01.320 --> 04:02.639
Start over again.

04:08.360 --> 04:09.634
Third position.

04:12.520 --> 04:13.919
First arabesque.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.353
Don't look at me.
Look into the distance.

04:21.399 --> 04:22.549
Lift your leg.

04:24.240 --> 04:25.434
Higher.

04:34.440 --> 04:35.953
You're not very limber.

04:47.000 --> 04:47.989
Well?

04:50.640 --> 04:53.200
l passed the audition.

04:53.320 --> 04:55.197
I know that. And?

04:55.320 --> 04:57.038
They took me.

04:57.160 --> 04:58.036
They took you?

05:00.200 --> 05:02.111
Good girl! That's wonderful!

05:04.120 --> 05:07.829
I told you, Natalia,
Polina will be a prima baIIerina.

05:07.960 --> 05:09.439
No, I won't.

05:10.360 --> 05:12.078
Why not? What's wrong?

05:13.480 --> 05:15.198
It's far too expensive.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.551
Keep your backs straight.

05:41.160 --> 05:42.639
Hold the position.

05:44.120 --> 05:46.076
The arms.

05:54.080 --> 05:56.275
Don't you want to watch the students?

05:56.400 --> 05:57.879
I see them just fine.

05:59.880 --> 06:01.074
Once again.

06:03.480 --> 06:04.833
Stand straight.

06:05.960 --> 06:07.439
Look at the mirror.

06:08.720 --> 06:09.675
Stop.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.556
What is "dancing" for you?

06:32.640 --> 06:34.949
It happens by itself.

06:38.120 --> 06:39.519
You think so, do you?

06:45.280 --> 06:47.396
We'll start from the pirouette.

06:48.000 --> 06:48.989
Music.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.115
- It's not too heavy?
- No.

09:12.200 --> 09:14.156
- Is this the last one?
- Yes.

09:16.920 --> 09:18.512
Polina, wake up.

09:19.360 --> 09:20.349
Give me a hand.

09:20.480 --> 09:23.790
Put the pants over there.
Jeans and T-shirts go on the shelves.

09:24.440 --> 09:26.271
This bag too.

09:27.120 --> 09:28.439
And that one too.

09:35.640 --> 09:38.313
It's all here. Count it.

09:39.240 --> 09:41.708
- No need.
- Nice work.

09:42.880 --> 09:44.233
The car's filled up!

09:44.840 --> 09:45.875
Goodbye.

09:49.440 --> 09:50.555
See you, Sergei.

09:51.040 --> 09:52.075
Bye, sweetheart.

09:57.040 --> 10:00.828
One, two, three, four...

10:05.360 --> 10:07.510
Higher. Even higher!

10:20.040 --> 10:21.553
Look at Xenia.

10:22.720 --> 10:25.109
Her position is almost perfect.

10:25.240 --> 10:29.074
Her body rotates almost ideally
around its axis.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.638
Thank you, class is over.

11:10.160 --> 11:11.275
Sir.

11:15.960 --> 11:20.033
Why don't you ever watch me
when I dance?

11:23.480 --> 11:26.517
Work harder, young lady,
instead of asking silly questions.

11:29.640 --> 11:33.076
If you didn't miss classes,
you'd dance better.

11:33.640 --> 11:36.950
I have to help my mother with her work.

11:38.200 --> 11:39.918
A ballerina has only one job.

11:40.440 --> 11:41.509
To dance.

12:10.440 --> 12:11.759
Be quiet!

12:11.880 --> 12:15.395
You want to warn the entire forest
that we're hunting?

12:18.400 --> 12:19.594
Look.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.272
"Off with their heads!"

13:41.160 --> 13:42.149
Polina.

13:43.080 --> 13:45.548
- Are we seeing each other after class?
- Okay.

13:59.760 --> 14:03.753
The audience must see
only the beauty of your movements.

14:06.280 --> 14:09.670
If you don't have
lightness and elegance,

14:11.520 --> 14:13.476
they will only see

14:14.200 --> 14:16.111
effort and difficulty.

14:16.600 --> 14:19.034
Only soccer fans
are interested in that!

15:38.240 --> 15:39.798
Hang on, you'll see.

15:40.960 --> 15:44.350
Not now, wait a while!

15:51.600 --> 15:53.989
I love to see you dance, Dad.

16:47.120 --> 16:48.872
I hope we're not spoiling the party?

16:53.600 --> 16:55.989
Nice place you got here, Anton.

16:56.480 --> 16:57.993
Business must be good.

17:00.200 --> 17:02.430
Right, missus? Business is good?

17:05.240 --> 17:06.388
How much do you owe us?

17:06.520 --> 17:09.432
I told you, I'll have the money soon.

17:16.480 --> 17:17.674
Your dad says

17:18.400 --> 17:20.914
you'll be a big ballet star.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.075
Is that right?

17:27.599 --> 17:28.715
Okay!

17:28.840 --> 17:31.718
I'll do the Afghanistan route.

17:33.840 --> 17:36.957
I like working with you, Anton.
You catch on fast.

17:45.960 --> 17:48.554
Your women are beautiful...

17:58.120 --> 17:59.951
What's the Afghanistan route?

18:02.240 --> 18:03.992
Nothing, it's no big deal.

18:37.160 --> 18:38.513
Don't let the effort show.

18:39.600 --> 18:40.828
Your leg higher.

18:45.960 --> 18:48.599
The arms breathe,
the legs breathe.

19:05.640 --> 19:06.868
No!

19:09.440 --> 19:11.032
You're completely off.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.118
Where's your head when you dance?

19:19.320 --> 19:21.550
Stand up straight when I talk to you.

19:22.440 --> 19:23.316
I'm sorry.

19:27.240 --> 19:29.913
You're somewhere, but not here.

19:31.160 --> 19:32.513
You have no grace.

19:34.280 --> 19:36.874
Your movements are...

19:37.560 --> 19:40.120
stiff, mechanical,

19:40.280 --> 19:42.714
ugly...

19:44.400 --> 19:46.118
Once again, please.

19:46.840 --> 19:47.795
Music.

19:57.080 --> 19:58.957
How long have we been
working on this?

20:04.240 --> 20:05.719
I can't even remember.

20:05.840 --> 20:08.274
And each day, it gets worse.
Stop!

20:13.360 --> 20:15.078
Once more please, from the beginning.

20:24.360 --> 20:26.476
That's not it at all!

20:26.600 --> 20:28.352
This isn't the circus!

20:28.480 --> 20:30.118
It's horrible! Stop!

20:38.760 --> 20:40.955
Do you feel what you're doing?

20:41.560 --> 20:42.515
No!

20:43.280 --> 20:45.032
You don't feel a thing.

20:45.160 --> 20:48.232
You don't know
where your arms or your legs are.

20:48.360 --> 20:51.591
Look at me when I talk to you.

21:03.680 --> 21:04.874
Once more?

21:05.440 --> 21:06.589
What for?

21:08.360 --> 21:12.035
Look, everyone is waiting for you.
But no.

21:14.600 --> 21:16.352
You must keep your emotions in rein,

21:17.120 --> 21:19.236
learn to control them.

21:19.760 --> 21:23.230
A dancer who has no self-control

21:23.360 --> 21:25.430
doesn't interest me!

21:25.560 --> 21:27.915
Get out! You won't dance this ballet.

21:28.040 --> 21:29.314
Svetlana...

21:29.440 --> 21:31.556
please replace Polina.

21:33.160 --> 21:34.115
Music.

22:48.600 --> 22:51.160
What are you doing here? It's late.

22:51.960 --> 22:54.554
I want to understand
what I'm doing wrong.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.511
And what do you think?

23:09.560 --> 23:11.039
My legs are too stiff.

23:11.200 --> 23:13.668
The problem isn't your legs,
it's your back.

23:15.600 --> 23:18.910
Your back is weak
and so your legs compensate.

23:20.520 --> 23:21.919
Fifth position.

23:25.040 --> 23:26.598
Pull your shoulder blades down.

23:29.880 --> 23:33.350
Imagine that your head is being held

23:33.760 --> 23:35.478
by a thread.

23:40.400 --> 23:41.879
Open your arms.

23:44.800 --> 23:46.199
Close your eyes.

23:48.320 --> 23:50.390
Feel the axis.

23:51.320 --> 23:52.548
Passé.

23:56.600 --> 23:57.749
Ala seconde.

24:00.680 --> 24:02.193
Attitude.

24:05.720 --> 24:08.871
Feel the position, your arms,

24:09.000 --> 24:09.989
your legs...

24:11.000 --> 24:12.194
Yes.

24:12.320 --> 24:13.719
Open your eyes.

24:30.080 --> 24:31.149
Very good.

24:35.640 --> 24:39.553
For the audition at the Bolshoi Academy,

24:39.680 --> 24:43.434
you'll dance the adagio variation
from Act 3 of Raymonda.

24:43.560 --> 24:44.515
Thank you.

26:07.080 --> 26:08.354
Wait for me here.

26:16.040 --> 26:17.234
The Bolshoi?

26:18.280 --> 26:19.998
It's a long path to get there.

26:21.360 --> 26:23.157
You want to pass the exam?

26:23.280 --> 26:25.191
Then you'll have to work.

26:25.320 --> 26:27.072
And l mean work hard!

26:30.040 --> 26:31.519
The Bolshoi Ballet

26:32.120 --> 26:34.588
is the symbol of Russia.

26:36.280 --> 26:37.474
Her pride.

26:38.440 --> 26:42.831
The very name recalls
the grandeur of Russia.

26:51.560 --> 26:53.312
The Bolshoi Ballet has...

26:54.000 --> 26:56.355
the richest dance repertoire
in the world,

26:57.320 --> 26:59.880
a company of outstanding virtuosos.

27:01.960 --> 27:05.714
Ulanova and Lepeshinskaya danced here.

27:05.840 --> 27:07.796
And many others too.

27:10.280 --> 27:13.875
For two years now,
I've trained you without respite

27:14.000 --> 27:16.468
to join this company.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.397
This majestic ballet.

27:19.840 --> 27:21.273
To succeed,

27:21.760 --> 27:23.876
you will need energy,

27:24.560 --> 27:26.312
determination,

27:26.880 --> 27:29.030
and the love of hard work.

27:32.720 --> 27:36.269
The date of your audition
is rapid/y approaching.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.719
So forget about partying

27:40.920 --> 27:43.036
and work even harder.

27:54.320 --> 27:56.151
Polina, I told you to wait for me.

27:56.720 --> 28:00.918
Please don't forget
our rules and requirements.

28:01.040 --> 28:05.431
I hope I can count
on your common sense.

28:06.640 --> 28:07.868
Okay.

28:08.600 --> 28:09.874
That's all.

28:10.720 --> 28:12.438
You can go now.

28:14.160 --> 28:15.309
Hey, Frenchie.

28:15.920 --> 28:17.990
Coming to the Karma Bar tonight?

28:18.880 --> 28:19.835
Sure.

28:19.960 --> 28:22.599
Just to make Alexandrovna happy.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.873
We have tomorrow off.
Come with us.

28:27.240 --> 28:28.912
I can't, I'm busy.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.268
Come on!

28:32.160 --> 28:34.230
You seeing Bojinski again?

28:34.920 --> 28:37.957
You're wasting
your only free night on that old fart?

28:38.080 --> 28:39.593
He's doing a solo for me.

28:39.720 --> 28:41.472
Isn't he too old-fashioned?

28:42.080 --> 28:44.913
He's still more interesting
than Alexandrovna.

28:45.440 --> 28:47.635
You're coming to the Budan festival?

28:47.760 --> 28:48.556
Of course.

28:48.680 --> 28:51.752
Come on, meet us after your rehearsal.

28:55.480 --> 28:56.595
I'll try.

28:58.720 --> 28:59.835
Not bad French.

29:00.400 --> 29:01.276
You impressed?

29:02.400 --> 29:03.196
Yeah.

30:04.680 --> 30:06.910
That's not bad at all.

30:08.440 --> 30:09.714
Is something wrong?

30:10.520 --> 30:13.830
I feel like I'm stringing moves together
without dancing.

30:13.960 --> 30:15.439
That's fabulous!

30:17.200 --> 30:20.795
A true artist
always longs for perfection.

30:21.240 --> 30:23.037
Only time will tell...

30:24.120 --> 30:25.678
if the path was right.

30:30.800 --> 30:34.156
People say your ballets
were too provocative for the Soviets.

30:38.720 --> 30:39.994
Yes, you could say that.

30:42.880 --> 30:46.873
They reproached me
for not being patriotic enough.

30:47.680 --> 30:50.478
I used music by American composers.

30:55.400 --> 30:56.719
I was too stubborn.

30:56.840 --> 30:57.670
No.

30:58.720 --> 31:00.915
That's why people respect you.

31:04.160 --> 31:07.152
Shall I start from the beginning
and you'll show me the rest?

32:21.680 --> 32:23.511
I have to go.

32:27.160 --> 32:29.196
You're not going to leave us like this?

32:31.000 --> 32:32.149
Polina...

32:34.800 --> 32:36.677
Look at me.

32:38.080 --> 32:43.029
No one will ever harm you. Ever.

32:51.560 --> 32:52.629
And you?

32:59.760 --> 33:02.479
When do you start with the Bolshoi?

33:03.680 --> 33:06.478
In June, if I pass the exam.

33:07.480 --> 33:08.595
You will.

33:09.960 --> 33:12.076
I have to get going. Goodbye.

33:16.240 --> 33:17.514
When will you be back?

34:59.840 --> 35:01.193
Polina Shanidze.

35:34.560 --> 35:35.834
You may begin.

38:29.160 --> 38:30.752
Are you going back to France?

38:37.080 --> 38:38.274
I'm coming with you.

38:39.040 --> 38:40.917
What do you mean,
you're coming with me?

38:42.960 --> 38:45.838
I want to pass the audition
with you in Aix-en...

38:46.520 --> 38:47.714
Provence.

38:48.560 --> 38:52.155
Why would you want to come to Aix?
You just made the Bolshoi.

38:52.840 --> 38:54.717
Besides, you don't know the technique.

38:55.080 --> 38:56.399
Who cares?

38:56.880 --> 38:59.838
I want to perform what we just saw.

39:00.320 --> 39:01.469
No.

39:01.600 --> 39:02.589
It's a mistake.

39:03.040 --> 39:04.109
Why?

39:05.520 --> 39:08.512
Even if you're in Moscow and I'm in Aix,
we'll be together.

39:12.760 --> 39:15.433
I don't care,
even if you don't go to the audition,

39:16.040 --> 39:17.473
I will.

39:20.760 --> 39:22.239
You're crazy!

39:49.160 --> 39:50.513
Are you leaving for long?

39:51.320 --> 39:52.469
I don't know.

39:52.920 --> 39:54.114
Maybe.

39:59.840 --> 40:01.512
You're going to France?

40:02.480 --> 40:04.630
Yes, to the south of France.

40:12.880 --> 40:14.120
What about the Bolshoi?

40:14.680 --> 40:17.240
You know what it means for us.

41:08.680 --> 41:09.874
Trust me.

41:50.480 --> 41:51.879
It's beautiful here.

41:52.640 --> 41:53.914
You like it?

42:02.240 --> 42:04.117
Hello. Welcome to the audition.

42:04.240 --> 42:07.391
We'll start the first routine
with Sergio.

42:07.760 --> 42:09.239
Spread out.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.316
Good luck.

42:13.560 --> 42:14.913
Four, five and go!

42:32.160 --> 42:33.513
Get into position.

42:33.640 --> 42:35.198
In lines, please.

42:47.080 --> 42:48.479
Third line. One!

42:52.880 --> 42:54.108
Jump!

42:54.680 --> 42:55.829
And exit.

43:04.720 --> 43:08.998
Sonia, Aurore, Claire, Kim,
Elise, Margot,

43:09.120 --> 43:12.476
Polina, Anthony, Théa, Lisa,
Adrien, Emilie, Jérémie

43:12.600 --> 43:13.476
and Chloé.

43:13.600 --> 43:16.558
The others can leave. Thank you.

43:17.840 --> 43:21.196
Now we'll work on
a different style of movement.

43:40.880 --> 43:42.518
Use your breath.

43:42.680 --> 43:44.318
Stretch, stretch...

43:45.280 --> 43:46.235
That's it.

43:52.560 --> 43:53.788
From the top.

43:57.160 --> 44:00.391
Use your weight! Heavy!

44:24.320 --> 44:26.709
If you like, I can translate for Polina.

44:27.640 --> 44:29.039
I haven't spoken yet.

44:32.760 --> 44:35.035
Well, just in case. I can do it.

44:35.600 --> 44:37.397
That's why I asked you to come.

44:38.520 --> 44:42.274
You've surely heard,
I always give my dancers a trial period.

44:42.800 --> 44:45.314
You'll start as trainees.

44:45.440 --> 44:47.396
And if we get along, I hire you on.

44:49.480 --> 44:50.435
I understood.

44:54.400 --> 44:57.472
Polina took
a few French lessons in Russia

44:57.600 --> 45:01.275
and we've been together
for a few months,

45:01.400 --> 45:03.789
so she's starting to understand.

45:05.200 --> 45:06.918
But it's good he's here.

45:07.040 --> 45:08.712
He could be of service anyhow.

45:09.640 --> 45:11.710
She's right, he could be of service.

45:18.720 --> 45:20.039
Help yourself.

45:25.400 --> 45:26.913
Have you seen Snow White?

45:27.360 --> 45:28.429
Yes.

45:29.080 --> 45:30.752
At the Budan festival.

45:32.280 --> 45:33.759
You're very classical,

45:34.280 --> 45:37.033
but you have an inner strength
that interests me.

45:38.280 --> 45:40.430
You'll learn the role of Snow White.

45:41.600 --> 45:44.068
And you Adrien, the prince.

45:46.080 --> 45:47.115
Thank you.

45:47.920 --> 45:50.480
You'll work the corps movements
with Sergio,

45:50.640 --> 45:52.676
and the duets with me.

46:01.520 --> 46:02.839
Pay close attention.

46:03.880 --> 46:06.189
You need to change
your technical approach.

46:06.960 --> 46:09.474
In my work,
the center of gravity is much lower.

46:10.360 --> 46:12.157
It's more grounded than classical.

46:13.120 --> 46:15.315
You need to work really hard in class.

46:35.800 --> 46:37.518
Change...

46:43.160 --> 46:44.718
All together...

46:59.560 --> 47:00.390
Turn!

47:00.520 --> 47:01.509
Push off!

47:06.920 --> 47:07.909
Faster.

47:16.880 --> 47:18.916
Okay. That wasn't bad.

47:19.960 --> 47:23.919
But the beginning wasn't very clear.
We'll go over it again.

47:24.680 --> 47:28.355
When you drop to your knees,
use the momentum of the upper body.

47:28.480 --> 47:31.472
- This will help.
- Thank you.

47:32.720 --> 47:35.359
The movement starts from your center.

47:35.800 --> 47:38.917
Let's take it from the beginning.
Without music.

48:10.120 --> 48:11.348
Stop it.

48:12.440 --> 48:14.237
You training to be a commando?

48:14.360 --> 48:15.679
What's that?

48:16.120 --> 48:18.793
Commandos are tough guys, like you.

48:19.680 --> 48:21.477
I have injuries everywhere.

48:22.320 --> 48:24.914
They're called "bruises."
It's part of dance.

48:25.040 --> 48:27.474
- Anyone for volleyball?
- Sure.

48:27.600 --> 48:28.555
- Girls?
- Why not.

48:29.080 --> 48:29.876
Polina?

48:30.480 --> 48:33.119
No. Tomorrow we're working with Liria.

48:33.960 --> 48:35.791
It's up to you. Let's go.

49:27.840 --> 49:29.034
No. Sergio, stop the music.

49:29.520 --> 49:31.112
That's too pretty.

49:31.280 --> 49:33.919
It's pretty.
I'm looking for something real.

49:35.760 --> 49:38.911
It's the first time
you're giving yourself to him.

49:39.040 --> 49:41.429
There's danger, there's urgency...

49:42.200 --> 49:43.599
there's fear.

49:44.320 --> 49:45.719
And I feel nothing.

49:46.320 --> 49:47.639
What's your background?

49:48.400 --> 49:49.435
Where are you from?

49:51.560 --> 49:54.313
My father comes
from a poor family in Georgia.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.877
My mother's Siberian.

49:57.800 --> 49:59.836
There you go. You know it all.

50:00.800 --> 50:02.392
You know about not having enough.

50:03.680 --> 50:05.636
But it's a love duet.

50:05.760 --> 50:08.320
It's a duet of desire, of passion.

50:08.920 --> 50:10.751
It's about having nothing

50:10.880 --> 50:13.917
and wanting something
more than anything in the world.

50:15.640 --> 50:18.791
I don't want a pretty dancer.
I want to see Polina dance.

50:21.400 --> 50:23.356
You understand? Once more?

50:32.240 --> 50:33.719
Already dressed?

50:33.880 --> 50:34.915
Yes.

50:35.800 --> 50:37.756
I want to rehearse.

50:39.440 --> 50:41.112
We rehearsed all week.

50:41.800 --> 50:44.951
Liria gave us a day off to rest.

50:45.920 --> 50:47.638
That's part of the work too.

50:50.880 --> 50:52.871
Get undressed and come back to bed.

50:53.360 --> 50:54.315
No.

50:55.120 --> 50:55.996
Yes.

50:56.680 --> 50:57.669
No.

51:01.920 --> 51:02.955
No.

51:03.760 --> 51:05.751
- No.
- Yes.

51:06.200 --> 51:07.633
Do what you want.

51:09.440 --> 51:10.350
Okay.

51:31.840 --> 51:33.796
Didn't I give you a day off?

51:34.680 --> 51:37.069
I want to get the movements right.

51:39.440 --> 51:41.476
You're rehearsing without Adrien.

51:42.640 --> 51:43.516
Yes.

51:43.920 --> 51:45.069
For me.

51:47.920 --> 51:48.875
I see.

51:54.200 --> 51:55.758
Have you ever missed someone?

51:58.880 --> 52:01.030
Felt the absence of a loved one?

52:03.440 --> 52:04.475
A little.

52:05.400 --> 52:07.994
All my work is about this.

52:10.640 --> 52:12.949
Longing for someone who's not there.

52:15.120 --> 52:18.112
It's important
to feel that when you dance.

52:19.120 --> 52:20.394
Longing.

52:23.560 --> 52:24.834
See you tomorrow?

52:25.520 --> 52:27.112
And stay grounded.

52:27.240 --> 52:28.275
Thank you.

52:32.200 --> 52:34.236
I don't see enough hip.

52:34.800 --> 52:36.870
Look. Come here, Sergio.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.150
Give yourselves to each other.

52:39.280 --> 52:41.840
Your legs join all the way down.

52:44.520 --> 52:45.430
You see?

52:46.480 --> 52:49.950
There has to be full contact
in all of the lifts.

52:55.000 --> 52:56.718
Lift her with your head.

52:58.720 --> 53:01.234
You need to be in tune.

53:04.960 --> 53:06.029
Feel her weight.

53:06.200 --> 53:08.555
Feel her weight before pushing off.

53:12.240 --> 53:14.515
One goes up
and the other goes forward.

53:17.160 --> 53:19.469
- Why aren't you in front of me?
- I am.

53:19.600 --> 53:21.591
You give the direction otherwise I slip.

53:21.760 --> 53:26.470
That's not exactly it.
You both give the direction.

53:26.640 --> 53:30.110
You need to feel her weight
to push her forward,

53:30.240 --> 53:31.798
otherwise it won't work.

53:31.920 --> 53:35.993
- See? You're doing it wrong.
- Let's do it again.

53:39.360 --> 53:41.920
That's enough.
We'll continue tomorrow.

53:42.440 --> 53:44.032
No use getting upset.

53:47.720 --> 53:49.358
It was hard today.

53:49.480 --> 53:52.358
- Why are you stopping me?
- I'm not.

53:53.480 --> 53:55.675
I'm doing my best. Like you.

53:57.320 --> 53:59.072
My work is shit because of you.

53:59.440 --> 54:00.634
She's not happy.

54:00.760 --> 54:03.638
Your work isn't shit.
She just wants us to make progress.

54:04.160 --> 54:05.309
It's no big deal.

54:05.440 --> 54:07.271
I'm too classical.

54:13.520 --> 54:15.351
You have a torn toenail?

54:15.520 --> 54:18.592
Maybe. I don't know.
Why are you changing subjects?

54:18.720 --> 54:21.234
I'm not changing subjects.
I don't know!

54:21.400 --> 54:22.799
I'm not in her head.

54:24.800 --> 54:26.472
I'm just as lost as you.

54:26.600 --> 54:28.636
I'm trying to make her happy too, okay?

54:44.240 --> 54:45.275
From above...

54:46.720 --> 54:47.709
Release.

54:51.760 --> 54:53.910
Hold your center. Watch your feet.

54:54.040 --> 54:56.110
No, the feet have to be...

54:56.920 --> 55:00.037
You don't really need
to put your weight on them.

55:00.160 --> 55:02.276
You're like a rag doll.

55:07.800 --> 55:08.949
That's better.

55:10.640 --> 55:11.516
Let your head go.

55:11.640 --> 55:13.119
Sonia, you go ﬁrst.

55:14.840 --> 55:17.673
That's better. Did you feel it?

55:21.280 --> 55:22.349
Get into place.

55:39.560 --> 55:40.310
Are you okay?

55:40.480 --> 55:43.040
- Where did you hurt yourself?
- My ankle.

55:45.920 --> 55:48.150
- Oh shit.
- Lie down.

55:50.960 --> 55:51.949
Breathe.

56:12.560 --> 56:14.516
I suggest Massimo for Berratham.

56:15.160 --> 56:16.354
- You okay with that?
- Yeah.

56:18.160 --> 56:19.275
Back to the barre.

56:22.040 --> 56:24.190
Four ronds de jambe en dehors.

56:29.280 --> 56:31.840
Battement plié devant...

59:43.720 --> 59:45.119
Take your foot.

59:46.440 --> 59:48.510
Devant, a la seconde...

59:51.200 --> 59:52.633
Port de bras.

59:56.960 --> 59:58.712
And come back.

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:02.879
Knees in your hands.

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:05.189
Knee in your hand!

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.838
Watch the hip, Massimo.

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:45.588
Hi there.

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:48.356
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:53.360
I want the role of Snow White back.

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:56.392
- You're not ready.
- Yes, I'm sure I am.

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:01.480
You're hardworking and you have talent,

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:03.830
but you can't demand things.

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:07.474
You're too obsessed with yourself,
your work.

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:09.358
Look around. Observe.

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:12.071
An artist is someone...

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:13.918
someone who observes.

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:19.915
Watch Sonia when she dances with Adrien.
Something happens.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.630
She listens to him, feels him, sees him.

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.913
Everything shows on stage.

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:29.069
You understand?

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:50.429
Hello.

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:53.839
I'd like to know,
are you looking for dancers?

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:58.594
Okay, thanks.

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:09.875
No. Don't flap around.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.833
I see arms and legs all day long.

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:17.877
Make me feel something.

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:22.157
Make me feel what it is to know God.

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:26.511
You don't want me to dance?

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:28.189
I'd rather you didn't.

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:31.313
But I'm a dancer.

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:34.113
Since you can dance, why bother?

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:41.109
You wanted me to audition you?

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:03.556
No. That's not it.

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:06.119
Find something else.

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:12.233
- But what do you want?
- I don't know.

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:23.559
What are you doing?

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:25.395
I'm leaving.

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:27.714
Are you sure?

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:35.833
The same energy.
Everyone on the same rhythm.

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.393
Rotation and...

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:39.272
Good. Don't worry.

01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:41.678
Follow me.

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:45.074
In a circle and back to your places.

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:49.674
Stay in a group. Move together.

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:56.273
Release.

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:10.070
Hello.

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:12.515
I'm a dancer.

01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:15.518
I studied at the Bolshoi.
I'm looking for work.

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:18.076
We don't need anyone right now.

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:19.990
Thank you.

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:27.589
Mom? Hi.

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:30.313
Yeah, everything's fine.

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:34.629
Things went really well in Berlin.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.877
We got a standing ovation.

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:44.749
No, right now I'm in Paris.
We're still on tour.

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:49.508
I'm not alone, I'm with the troupe.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.513
Wait, I have to say hi to someone.

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:55.235
Sergio! How's it going?

01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:59.071
I can't, I'm talking to my mom!

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:03.359
Bojinski?

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:04.879
No, I didn't see him.

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:11.239
I'm sorry, I have to go now.
We're going for dinner.

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:15.470
I'll call you back later.

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:19.390
Okay. Love you too.

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:28.275
Good evening.

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:31.558
I'm in Room 19.

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:34.148
You didn't pay this morning.

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:36.759
Oh, I'm sorry!

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:39.390
That'll be 35, please.

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:50.077
That's not 35.

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:53.034
I know. I'll pay the rest real fast.

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:56.635
Then I can't give you the room.

01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:59.360
I'm sorry.
I'm not the one who decides.

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:01.469
Okay.

01:09:15.399 --> 01:09:16.196
Hello.

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:19.640
Excuse me, I'm looking for work.

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:21.950
I'm sorry, we don't need anyone.

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:23.515
Thank you.

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:20.592
Come party with us! It's fun here!

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:53.914
Hey!

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:55.989
- Three vodkas...
- Excuse me...

01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:57.155
And one scotch.

01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:59.438
Get me some ice!

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:02.239
I'm looking for work.

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:18.396
Want to start right now?

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:20.875
Yes, but I have no experience.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.958
Doesn't matter, you'll learn fast.
Come behind the bar.

01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:17.354
Don't worry.

01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:56.349
Hello.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.115
You speak French?

01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:00.631
I saw you working outside the building.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.150
I've never seen that before.

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:07.994
I use improvisation to teach kids.

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:09.109
Excuse me.

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:15.195
At the Bolshoi school
we never did improvisation.

01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:16.958
You studied at the Bolshoi?

01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:19.510
I'm impressed.

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.994
I love it.
But I just came to post my ad.

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:24.473
- Sorry.
- No problem.

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:32.791
Could it be a girl?

01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:36.390
- For what?
- Do you take girls as roommates?

01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:37.635
Of course.

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:41.752
Then I'm interested.

01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:59.235
I'm making tea. Want some?

01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:01.918
Sure. I'm coming.

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:05.949
Today we'll do an improvisation I like.
You'll pretend you're an animal.

01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:08.549
Any one you like.

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:13.511
Imagine its movements
if it got on stage and danced.

01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:16.916
I don't want an imitation.
That's not the idea.

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:20.157
Find something
with your own movements and energy.

01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:23.158
It's a good excuse to get up and dance.

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:25.673
Who'll go first?

01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:59.712
Very good, Jan, full of imagination.

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:02.557
Polina, you want to try?

01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:06.628
Sorry, I don't know how to do that.

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:09.115
Go for it, Polina.
Can't be worse than us.

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:11.629
Besides,
we've never seen a real ballerina.

01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:13.591
Sure we have. Karl's a ballerina.

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:19.631
Put some music on for Polina.

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:29.637
Antwerp, Belgium.

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:40.509
But Dad...

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.831
Don't make a detour.

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:45.872
Honestly, it's not worth it.

01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:52.755
Polina.

01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:57.193
What happened?

01:18:58.640 --> 01:18:59.675
Nothing.

01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:01.718
It's impossible.

01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:04.348
Something must've happened.
It's obvious.

01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:14.753
Come back to Moscow.

01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:18.476
No.

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:31.234
I worked hard all those years

01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:33.476
so you could end up in a bar!

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:36.351
And I didn't work hard?

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:37.879
That's the whole point.

01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:45.229
I'm sick of mindlessly executing
other people's choreography.

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:48.515
I need to learn to look at the world.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.513
"Look at the world".

01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:01.470
I have to go.

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.960
We're not going for dinner?

01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:08.399
No, I have to work.

01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:10.959
I'll drive you.

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:13.719
Don't bother. It's nearby, I'll walk.

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:21.189
Do you have enough money?

01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:22.469
Yes, don't worry.

01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:34.639
Give my love to Mom.

01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:58.069
The Montpellier Festival
is looking for young choreographers.

01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:00.675
I have contacts.
You should present something.

01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:03.398
I'm sure they'd come to Antwerp.

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:08.554
Your artistic universe touches people.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.513
The kids are still talking about it.

01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:21.069
What about the festival?

01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:24.995
The Polina from the Bolshoi is over.

01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:42.435
The wind's stopped. Want to go out?

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:44.551
Let's go out a walk. It'll do you good.

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:48.119
- No.
- Yes.

01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:50.113
- Leave me alone.
- Come on!

01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:51.878
Let go! You have no right!

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.672
I'm fed up
of seeing you like this!

01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:55.796
Go sit over there, wash up,

01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:57.148
take your clothes,

01:23:57.640 --> 01:23:58.629
and get dressed!

01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:01.429
Hurry up.

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:50.757
You really think
the guy from the festival would come?

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:51.915
Yes.

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:54.355
He'll be in Brussels next week.

01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:58.114
- We'll present a duet.
_ "We"?

01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:01.877
- You and me.
- No, no.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.831
I was only talking about you.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:05.955
Okay.

01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:08.710
We'll improvise like at the port.

01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:11.915
You come up behind me
and follow my movements.

01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:41.513
Something wrong?

01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:44.115
No. Everything's fine.

01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:45.748
Let's continue.

01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:47.793
I push you...

01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:52.317
Can you do a turn?

01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:57.798
Again.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:28:59.910
That was good.

01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:02.511
- But you wait for me.
- Okay.

01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:04.471
I wait, turn, and pull you.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.558
Something like this.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.115
- Oh yes!
- Sorry.

01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:17.078
No, it's a good idea.

01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:21.158
Can I sit on your leg?

01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:22.793
And you lift me.

01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:24.514
Like this? By the hips?

01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:27.670
Yes.

01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:33.510
Like this?

01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:36.920
- Over my hip? Yeah?
- That's good.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.070
Like this? Okay, I see.

01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:08.235
It's no good.

01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:11.879
- It doesn't work at all.
- Yes. It's not bad.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.911
You said it. "Not bad."

01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:15.871
You know that's not enough.

01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:20.555
Come on, let's take a break.

01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:32.556
This could work. It'll get us moving.

01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:35.911
Maybe it'll give it more energy.
We can try.

01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:37.871
Or this. This is really old.

01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:07.229
That was good.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.399
It's getting interesting.

01:31:57.240 --> 01:32:00.232
Can you pull
an all-nighter tomorrow?

01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:01.156
Okay.

01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:14.155
Back to work.

01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:30.754
No, sorry, not tonight.

01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:34.031
Hey, girls!
You think you're on vacation?

01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:36.037
- The bar's packed.
- We're coming.

01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:37.673
We have customers.

01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:46.878
Your phone rang three times.

01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:54.833
Go on, Mom.

01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:03.670
When?

01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:00.519
Your father...

01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:07.834
wanted so badly
for you to be a great dancer.

01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:48.268
That's enough.

01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:52.398
Wait, she's coming!

01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:56.069
I'm sorry.
Everything was complicated.

01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:59.670
- I have other meetings.
- It won't take long. Honestly.

01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:02.598
You have to see us.

01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:07.111
- You have 15 minutes. No more.
- Okay.
