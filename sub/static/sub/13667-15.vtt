Kevin and Mike carried me.
They finished the job. That's
the kind of kids they are.

15:41.068 --> 15:44.238

and graffitied it all up.

Mr. O'Connor,
I'd really appreciate it...

15:57.952 --> 16:00.121
if you wouldn't use
the word "Nigger" Around me.

16:00.187 --> 16:02.323
Okay.

16:06.027 --> 16:08.362
All right, Myra. Myra, look,
I'll take care of it.

16:08.429 --> 16:12.233
You're wrong, Wendy.
I'm not. It is starve a cold,
feed a fever.

16:12.300 --> 16:14.635
Why would you want
to feed a fever?
Food is Calories.

16:14.702 --> 16:17.471
Calories is Energy.
Energy is Heat.

16:17.538 --> 16:19.473
Ergo, all you're adding
is fuel to the furnace.

16:19.540 --> 16:21.609
That's right.
Wendy, can I talk to you?

16:21.676 --> 16:23.811
In a minute.
Listen, food is nutrition.

16:23.878 --> 16:26.514
The body needs nutrition
In order to replenish
the immune system.

16:26.581 --> 16:30.084
And that is how
you break a fever.
What do you think, Herb?

16:30.151 --> 16:32.653
Would you go with me
to Craig's party tonight?

16:32.720 --> 16:35.022
Frankly, I don't think
I'm your type.

Come on. Just this once.

16:37.124 --> 16:39.560

It'll be short and Painless.

16:39.627 --> 16:41.562
That's why you can
never get a date.

16:41.629 --> 16:44.232

If I show up alone
to Craig's party,

I'm biologically imbalanced.

You're my last hope.

16:48.869 --> 16:51.372

Did he hurt himself?
No, not that I know of.

36:20.908 --> 36:24.645
He better not cut hisself.
It's gonna be me
that has to clean it up.

The nurse is in there.

36:55.076 --> 36:58.246
Because of everything

36:58.312 --> 37:01.816
That boy that died.
Everything's all my fault.

37:01.882 --> 37:05.453

has absolutely nothing to do
with That boy dying.

just have one.
Okay.

I wish I could give you
something for your headache.

37:31.779 --> 37:34.115

You want some jam?

37:34.181 --> 37:36.851
Um, no.
No, I'm fine, thank you.

These kids are not interested
in an education.

37:38.920 --> 37:41.355
They're interested

38:03.511 --> 38:06.047

38:06.113 --> 38:08.182
I can't tell you
how badly I feel.

38:08.249 --> 38:11.052
Emotionally or physically?

38:11.118 --> 38:14.422
Both. I-I-I-- I really
don't know what happened.

38:14.488 --> 38:17.024
Well, I'll tell you
what happened.
You got blind Drunk.

38:17.091 --> 38:19.060
That's what happened.

38:19.126 --> 38:22.530
I know, and I just wanted
to apologize to both of you.

38:22.597 --> 38:25.366
It's all right.
Don't worry.
Everything's fine.

38:25.433 --> 38:27.468
No, it's not.

Well, wherever the hell
he came from.

38:34.141 --> 38:38.079
- You're supposed to be
apologizing to him.
- I will.

38:38.145 --> 38:40.081
How do you say "I'm sorry"
in swedish?

38:40.147 --> 38:43.317
I went to a lot of trouble,
Ehrlich, and you let me down.

38:43.384 --> 38:46.921
<i>Now, I can understand you being
nervous or uncomfortable.</i>

38:46.988 --> 38:49.924
And I've been known
to hoist a few in my time.

38:49.991 --> 38:55.229
But what disappoints me the most
is that you are on call today,

38:55.296 --> 38:57.465
and I don't think you're capable
of doing the work.

38:57.531 --> 39:01.869

Now I'm not so sure anymore.

39:16.083 --> 39:19.453
I'll be down in five minutes.
I'll drive you to the hospital.

39:22.423 --> 39:25.493
Just ignore him, Victor.
That's what I do.

39:26.594 --> 39:28.563
I feel terrible.

39:29.830 --> 39:31.933

Okay, fine.
Go wait down the Hall.

That's it.
You've got to put
an end to this.

39:45.279 --> 39:47.448
You should have brought it
to my attention sooner.

39:47.515 --> 39:51.152
I didn't think I needed to.
They're like rabbits.

39:51.218 --> 39:54.355
First there were two,
then there were six,
and now they're everywhere.

39:54.422 --> 39:56.624
And it's not just
the patients, Daniel.

39:56.691 --> 39:59.794
Male members of my staff
keep disappearing
for hours at a time.

39:59.860 --> 40:02.263
Perhaps we ought to have
a meeting with the ladies.

A meeting?

40:04.332 --> 40:06.500
Daniel,
these aren't quakers.

40:06.567 --> 40:11.339
Helen, it's essential
in matters of this kind
to be diplomatic.

40:15.243 --> 40:20.381
Well, see, me and my Brother
were going to
st. Margaret's,

40:20.448 --> 40:22.783
a catholic school.

40:22.850 --> 40:24.885
And then the old man
got laid off,

40:24.952 --> 40:28.055
so we've been going to
this public high school
in southie.

40:28.122 --> 40:30.491
<i>And I like it there.</i>

40:30.558 --> 40:34.262
Anyway, Eileen--
That's my friend.

40:34.328 --> 40:37.798
Well, we were in
the same classes together.

40:37.865 --> 40:41.602
And, see, she lives in roxbury,
but they bus her in.

40:41.669 --> 40:44.538
And I knew my dad
wouldn't like it.

40:44.605 --> 40:48.609
<i>But we started
spending time together,
and we became friends.</i>

40:48.676 --> 40:52.413
You know, like you do
when you see somebody
in school every day, and--

40:53.481 --> 40:55.650
So I told my brother
Mike about it.

40:55.716 --> 40:59.420
You know, about me
being friends with Eileen,

40:59.487 --> 41:02.957
and... then he told Dad.

41:03.024 --> 41:05.359
<i>Mike didn't know
he was gonna beat me.</i>

41:05.426 --> 41:08.095
Your father beat you 'cause you
were friends with a black girl?

41:08.162 --> 41:11.098
No, he thought it
was more than that.

41:11.165 --> 41:13.935
Kevin, what we're gonna do is...

41:14.001 --> 41:16.370
get ahold of social services
and find you a place to stay.

41:16.437 --> 41:18.906
- No.
- You can't go home
with that man again.

41:18.973 --> 41:21.409
We'll call the police
so you can press charges.

41:21.475 --> 41:23.978
I can't do that!
He's my father!

41:24.045 --> 41:26.647
Kevin, he could do it again!

41:26.714 --> 41:30.418
- Next time, I'll run.
- Next time, he could blind you.

41:30.484 --> 41:33.988
- He's my father.
- He almost killed you, son.

41:34.055 --> 41:39.794
Look, I know one thing
for sure, and that's that he
loves me and my brother.

41:39.860 --> 41:41.729
He needs us.

41:50.638 --> 41:53.407
What can we do?

41:53.474 --> 41:55.977
He's too old to be
a ward of the state,
and he won't press charges.

41:56.043 --> 41:58.312

41:58.379 --> 42:01.415

43:00.241 --> 43:06.013
When a plumber comes to visit
a sick coworker here,

43:06.080 --> 43:09.050
he doesn't go around
unclogging all our sinks.

43:09.116 --> 43:11.552

to these women stinks.

43:28.436 --> 43:30.471
But that's not the issue.

43:30.538 --> 43:33.374
What we're trying to run here,
Buster, is a hospital.

43:33.441 --> 43:38.346
Now, that is difficult enough
without this kind of aberrant
behavior infesting the hallways.

43:38.412 --> 43:42.250
So, either you get them out of
here in the next five minutes,

43:42.316 --> 43:45.019

43:59.500 --> 44:04.205
You beat up your son.
What goes on between me and my
boys is no concern of yours!

44:04.272 --> 44:07.275
You smashed his nose,
you broke his ribs.
He lost a kidney.

You're lucky he didn't die.

you're trying to do.

You doctors think you're
better than people like me.

44:12.146 --> 44:15.316
Let me tell you something.
I love my boys.
What we got you can't touch.

44:15.383 --> 44:17.318
I've been a good father to them
since their mother died.

44:17.385 --> 44:20.788
Ain't been a day gone by
that they ain't had clean
clothes and a decent meal.

44:20.855 --> 44:22.924
I grew up with people

44:22.990 --> 44:25.059
I know how tough
it's been for you.

44:25.126 --> 44:30.031
But you're not the only one
in this world that ever
lost a job or a wife.

44:30.097 --> 44:32.033
You talk about love
and family and respect.

44:32.099 --> 44:34.802
You don't even know
what those words mean.
All you know is you're angry.

44:34.869 --> 44:37.305
You have to hit people.
And the sickest part
of it is...

44:37.371 --> 44:39.974
you take it out on the people
you supposedly care
the most about.

44:40.041 --> 44:43.711
Shove that
dime-Store shrink talk!
I hate people like you!

44:43.778 --> 44:45.713
And I'm telling you
something right now.

44:45.780 --> 44:49.350
I'm gonna do everything in my
power to stop you from doing
any more damage to that boy.

44:49.417 --> 44:53.120
Why, you--
You gonna swing on me?
You wanna hit me?

44:53.187 --> 44:56.490
Wouldn't you feel a little
more comfortable with
a baseball bat in your hand?

44:56.557 --> 44:58.593
I learned to fight
the same place you did,
pally-Boy.

44:58.659 --> 45:01.228
There's nothing
I'd like better right now
than to tear you apart.

45:14.909 --> 45:18.312
The thing that keeps
coming back to me is
how much trouble this caused...

45:18.379 --> 45:21.649
and how quick everybody
was to accept a lie.

45:21.716 --> 45:24.418
Yeah, well,
that's Boston for you.

45:24.485 --> 45:26.520

45:30.191 --> 45:32.960
The reality is
that walking in Boston's
historic Freedom Trail...

45:33.027 --> 45:35.796
is more dangerous than walking
in a freedom March down South.

45:35.863 --> 45:38.432
Yeah, I'm beginning
to agree with you.

45:40.968 --> 45:43.104
<i>I don't know.</i>

45:43.170 --> 45:47.508
I guess I never had to be
concerned with the big
issues of race relations.

45:47.575 --> 45:50.144
I always dealt
with people one-On-One.

45:50.211 --> 45:52.647

45:54.982 --> 45:57.451

There's things about me

46:08.262 --> 46:10.197
I'm not trying
to pass judgment.

46:10.264 --> 46:13.768
There's things about your wife
you'll never understand
because she's a woman.

46:13.834 --> 46:17.805
Yeah. But she's still my wife,
and we're still friends.

46:25.346 --> 46:27.281

One guy even says,
"Yeah, I'm gonna be president
one day, bro."

47:00.281 --> 47:04.051
and I'm standing there
trying to apologize to them
like I did something wrong.

47:04.118 --> 47:09.223
I mean, it's--
I can't be responsible
for everybody, Jack.

47:11.525 --> 47:13.494
