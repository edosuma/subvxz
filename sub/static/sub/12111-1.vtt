00:52.553 --> 00:55.930
You know, sometimes it seems
like life is all planned out.

00:56.014 --> 00:58.057
There's no choice
in the matter.

00:58.142 --> 01:01.811
We're all gonna end up in the same
place, whether we like it or not.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.480
But sometimes things
aren't so simple.

01:05.149 --> 01:07.900
You can end up hurting the
people you love the most,

01:08.318 --> 01:10.903
betraying the people you
want to come through for.

01:12.656 --> 01:16.117
That's not me.
That's my best friend, Steve.

01:16.201 --> 01:17.744
We've been best friends
since third grade,

01:17.828 --> 01:22.331
when he punched this kid, Billy Utsch,
for slamming a locker door on my head.

01:23.250 --> 01:27.295
That's me. I"m Darren
Shan, and this is my story.

01:28.046 --> 01:31.257
Oh, and, trust me, spending
this much time in a coffin

01:31.341 --> 01:33.593
was never part of my plan.

01:33.677 --> 01:35.011
Guess l'm just lucky.

04:24.306 --> 04:27.183
Up until recently,
my life was pretty good.

04:29.561 --> 04:31.520
l was popular enough.

04:32.022 --> 04:35.149
l got good grades, 'cause
my allowance was tied to it.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.235
A's! l love you.
l love you.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.988
Yeah, that's the boy.
That's the boy.

04:41.073 --> 04:42.657
Hey, you.
What's up, D?

04:42.741 --> 04:44.659
And l had
some cool friends.

04:44.743 --> 04:46.410
Hey, what's up?

04:46.536 --> 04:48.663
Uh,
not including that dude.

04:48.747 --> 04:53.167
I mean, we were friends in fifth
grade, but he'd become kind of a freak.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.503
See, that used to
matter to me.

04:56.171 --> 05:00.800
There was one thing in my life
that was a bit insane, one friend.

05:00.884 --> 05:02.551
Hey.
My best friend.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.553
Let's cut, all right?
What?

05:04.638 --> 05:06.597
No, we're here.
Class is starting, man.

05:06.682 --> 05:08.265
All right, folks.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.644
What you got for me?

05:11.728 --> 05:14.438
Okay, listen, l cannot
deal with that jerk today.

05:14.523 --> 05:19.777
All right, Mr. Perfect, come on,
take a risk. Take a risk. Come on!

05:26.660 --> 05:30.454
So, hey, l'm thinking about
moving to Mexico. You want to go?

05:30.747 --> 05:31.872
Yeah, sure. Why not?

05:31.957 --> 05:34.083
Yeah, you're not going
anywhere, Mr. Perfect.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.919
Oh, shit.

05:37.754 --> 05:41.424
Hey, man, l bet you can't hit that
light from all the way back here.

05:42.259 --> 05:44.635
What? No, we're
gonna get busted.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.554
"Steve, we're gonna
get busted."

05:50.100 --> 05:52.101
Hey!
Rock. Come on.

05:52.769 --> 05:58.107
And so the Mutually Assured
Destruction policy of the Cold War

05:58.692 --> 06:01.444
was just that. Mad.

06:04.573 --> 06:06.449
What the heck is that?

06:10.287 --> 06:11.454
l'm so sorry.

06:11.538 --> 06:14.582
lt's that Steve.
lt's that damn Steve.

06:14.666 --> 06:15.833
Uh...

06:15.917 --> 06:18.586
Did Darren tell you he got
an A on his math test?

06:18.670 --> 06:21.213
Yes, he did, honey.
Go to your room.

06:21.298 --> 06:24.133
You are not going to be
friends with that Steve anymore!

06:24.217 --> 06:25.885
Mom, l'm not
five years old.

06:25.969 --> 06:28.179
You can't tell me who l can
and can't be friends with.

06:28.263 --> 06:30.181
You are on
a good path, Darren,

06:30.265 --> 06:32.725
and that Steve is knocking
you right off that path.

06:32.809 --> 06:33.976
What path?

06:34.061 --> 06:37.438
The path to a happy,
productive life.

06:37.898 --> 06:42.443
To a good college, a great
job and a family of your own.

06:42.527 --> 06:47.364
A happy, productive life.
College, job, family!

06:47.449 --> 06:49.241
College, job,
family!

06:49.326 --> 06:51.577
And one day, if you're really lucky,

06:51.661 --> 06:54.413
you'll be standing here yelling
at a teenager of your own!

06:54.498 --> 06:56.749
College, job,
family!

06:57.334 --> 07:00.002
College, job, family!

07:00.337 --> 07:04.673
College, job, family!
lt's not that hard!

07:04.883 --> 07:06.592
Darren,
are you listening?

07:07.469 --> 07:08.761
So, wait. You...

07:08.845 --> 07:12.431
What, you told your parents you're
not gonna be friends with me anymore?

07:12.557 --> 07:15.392
Yeah, but, l mean,
it doesn't mean anything.

07:15.477 --> 07:17.812
We're still like
best friends.

07:17.896 --> 07:20.523
Okay, like what,
secret best friends?

07:22.567 --> 07:24.318
Yeah, kind of.

07:25.362 --> 07:26.946
l mean, no, it's like...

07:27.030 --> 07:28.781
Look, l don't care
what they say.

07:28.865 --> 07:30.199
Bullshit.

07:30.283 --> 07:33.119
You do care what they say.
You do whatever they say.

07:33.203 --> 07:34.620
That's just who you are.

07:34.704 --> 07:37.623
You never stand up for
yourself or anybody else.

07:37.707 --> 07:40.209
Maybe your parents
are right.

07:40.377 --> 07:43.129
Maybe you shouldn't be friends
with me. l'm nothing. l'm garbage.

07:43.213 --> 07:45.089
You're not garbage.

07:45.173 --> 07:48.259
You're my friend.
You're my best friend.

08:18.415 --> 08:19.915
Whoa!

08:20.000 --> 08:23.836
"Cirque du Freak. One night only.
The world's greatest freak show.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.588
"Five hundred years."
What the heck?

08:25.672 --> 08:27.047
Dude, that
looks awesome.

08:27.132 --> 08:30.551
l can't go, though.
l'm grounded for two months.

08:31.052 --> 08:33.721
Right. And we're also
not friends anymore.

08:37.392 --> 08:38.893
What's this?

08:40.020 --> 08:42.770
A freak show?
This is illegal.

08:43.481 --> 08:45.941
l hope you weren't thinking
of attending this.

08:47.277 --> 08:51.363
Because the idea of taking
a group of disgusting,

08:51.448 --> 08:57.161
weird, deformed people and exploiting
them for money... Not in our town.

08:58.121 --> 09:02.374
l'm assuming no one in this
class would actually go to this.

09:32.113 --> 09:35.157
Hey. You know that means something
when the moon looks like that.

09:35.909 --> 09:36.909
l read about it...

09:36.993 --> 09:38.786
ln one of your
vampire books?

09:39.579 --> 09:40.746
l should explain.

09:40.830 --> 09:43.791
Steve was obsessed
with vampires,

09:43.875 --> 09:47.336
and I, on the other hand,
was obsessed with spiders.

09:47.796 --> 09:51.715
l don't know why. lt was just like
it was in our blood or something.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.720
"Back in three seconds"?

09:57.681 --> 10:00.849
One, two, three.
lt's been three seconds.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.272
Uh...

10:07.274 --> 10:08.565
Okay.

10:09.192 --> 10:10.985
l guess they want money.

10:14.364 --> 10:17.074
Hey, l need two
tickets, please.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.079
Hey! Hey!

10:23.290 --> 10:25.749
Hey, come on. l gave you the
money, give me the ticket.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.293
Ow! Whoa!

10:27.377 --> 10:30.587
Holy crap!
God, what was that?

10:33.800 --> 10:35.134
Hey, come on!

10:36.594 --> 10:37.970
And it's gone.

10:38.888 --> 10:40.556
You okay?
Yeah.

10:45.395 --> 10:46.562
Hello?

10:53.737 --> 10:55.738
Are you boys 21?

10:57.240 --> 10:59.450
Are you 21?

11:00.618 --> 11:01.910
Say yes.

11:04.748 --> 11:05.831
Yeah.
Yeah.

11:05.915 --> 11:09.918
Good. You don't have
a tendency towards panic,

11:10.462 --> 11:15.591
sudden cardiac arrest or
crippling anxiety, do you?

11:17.093 --> 11:18.385
Say no.

11:20.597 --> 11:21.805
No.
No.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.726
All right, then.

11:29.689 --> 11:33.067
Go ahead in.
Show is about to start.

11:54.339 --> 11:55.839
Welcome.

11:55.924 --> 11:58.384
Welcome to the
Cirque du Freak,

11:58.468 --> 12:03.347
the oldest continuously operating
freak show in the Western hemisphere.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.265
We have toured
for 500 years,

12:05.350 --> 12:09.311
bringing the bizarre to
generation after generation.

12:09.771 --> 12:13.148
May l present the Wolfman!

12:23.827 --> 12:25.828
No sudden noises.

12:33.044 --> 12:35.629
Dude, he totally just
scratched his balls.

12:49.519 --> 12:51.186
No!

12:54.357 --> 12:55.607
Call an ambulance!

12:55.692 --> 12:57.359
lt's okay.
That's not necessary.

13:01.364 --> 13:02.865
Good boy.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.492
And stay.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.048
Ladies
and gentlemen,

13:20.133 --> 13:24.386
the enchanting recycling
queen, Corma Limbs.

13:25.013 --> 13:30.392
And now our resident hunger
artist, Alexander Ribs!

13:32.729 --> 13:37.274
Freaky-freak,
freak for freak freak.

13:37.358 --> 13:41.153
Oh, look, a candy corn.

13:42.197 --> 13:44.907
And next, Gertha Teeth!

13:50.246 --> 13:51.663
And Rhamus Twobellies!

13:51.748 --> 13:54.791
l have arrived!

14:17.440 --> 14:18.941
Hey, nice bike!

14:20.777 --> 14:23.570
Come on.
That is so rude.

14:23.655 --> 14:27.699
And next,
Evra the Snake Boy!

14:48.721 --> 14:49.972
Stay, Bippo.

14:50.557 --> 14:55.310
So, l'm Evra Von Britow,
and we are Serpentine.

14:55.478 --> 14:57.604
Who's "we"?

14:57.689 --> 15:01.650
There'll be some CDs for sale in the
lobby immediately following the show.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.909
Bippo! No!

15:11.452 --> 15:13.161
Bippo, drop it,
spit that out!

15:13.246 --> 15:15.872
Yes, l'm glad you're all enjoying
this so much. lt's awesome.

15:15.957 --> 15:18.542
Evra, please
be professional.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.753
lt's not my fault.
l just want to play music.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.255
We'll discuss it later.

15:23.339 --> 15:24.590
But...

15:24.674 --> 15:26.466
And now,

15:27.093 --> 15:30.345
the voluptuous,
the exotic,

15:31.472 --> 15:35.309
the insightful
Madame Truska!

15:43.818 --> 15:47.529
Do we have someone brave
enough to be my assistant?

15:47.697 --> 15:49.197
Over here.
Oh, yeah.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.116
Come on. Come on.

15:52.035 --> 15:53.035
You.

16:20.271 --> 16:22.022
Who are you?

16:23.775 --> 16:28.570
My name is Fred Smith.
l'm from out of town.

16:47.757 --> 16:50.926
Larten, finish your act quickly,
and let's leave this town early.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.803
What? l have someone
here tonight.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.180
Ready for more?

16:55.264 --> 16:58.308
Larten Crepsley
and Madam Octa!

17:00.103 --> 17:03.063
Don't go on.
l have a foreboding.

17:03.398 --> 17:05.190
You always have
a foreboding, beautiful.

17:05.273 --> 17:06.942
Larten!

17:13.491 --> 17:14.700
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

17:14.784 --> 17:17.160
l am so excited to be here
in anonymous small town

17:17.244 --> 17:19.454
which used to have character
but is now just a bland suburb

17:19.539 --> 17:22.040
filled with chain stores
and surrounded by slums.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.000
lt really is a pleasure
to be here.

17:24.085 --> 17:25.377
And l am so honored that

17:25.461 --> 17:29.381
blah, blah, blah and so on and
so forth, et cetera, ad nauseum.

17:30.299 --> 17:33.343
l'm afraid l have some
unfortunate news, however.

17:33.428 --> 17:37.597
l had hoped to present my usual
act, but my spider, Madam Octa,

17:37.682 --> 17:41.184
seems to have escaped from her
cage and is currently missing.

17:41.602 --> 17:45.230
Use caution when retrieving your
belongings from beneath your seats.

17:45.314 --> 17:48.066
She is very poisonous.

17:48.151 --> 17:49.526
But not to worry.

17:49.610 --> 17:54.656
Tonight l will perform for you
some startling illusions.

17:55.408 --> 17:59.411
First, a rabbit from a hat.

18:04.292 --> 18:06.084
This is Madam Octa.

18:07.712 --> 18:11.798
lnteresting fact, one bite from
this spider means certain death.

18:12.133 --> 18:15.802
But don't worry.
As long as l stay calm...

18:15.887 --> 18:17.512
She's beautiful.

18:17.805 --> 18:20.849
lf l could just get
my flute, that usually...

19:01.265 --> 19:04.267
Darren. His name's
not Larten Crepsley.

19:04.352 --> 19:06.394
lt's Vur Horsten.
He's a vampire.

19:07.730 --> 19:10.315
l saw his painting
in one of my vampire books.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.821
lt's him. He's got
the same scars,

19:15.905 --> 19:18.073
the same hair,
the same everything.

19:20.201 --> 19:21.618
You seriously think
he's a vampire?

19:21.702 --> 19:22.911
Yeah.

19:40.429 --> 19:42.931
May l have my spider
back, please?

19:46.811 --> 19:49.604
Now, boys,
vampires don't exist,

19:49.689 --> 19:53.316
but if one did and he
thought someone knew,

19:53.401 --> 19:55.777
he might smother them
in their sleep.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.198
That's it! Show's over!

20:00.700 --> 20:02.826
lt's Mr. Kersey.
Come on, let's go.

20:02.910 --> 20:06.621
By order of the Health lnspector,
this theater is shut down!

20:06.706 --> 20:08.498
Good Lord, not again.

20:08.916 --> 20:12.627
Welcome to the Cirque.
What seems to be the problem?

20:12.795 --> 20:15.171
We don't want you
filthy people here.

20:15.464 --> 20:16.506
That's not the problem.

20:16.591 --> 20:21.595
The problem is you are exploiting
these poor people for profit.

20:21.679 --> 20:26.099
Thank you. Thank you so
much for looking out for us.

20:26.183 --> 20:29.895
So you gonna let us move
in with you? Give us jobs?

20:30.605 --> 20:32.188
Freak!

20:32.732 --> 20:37.110
So clumsy. l felt like a
manatee. lt felt terrible.

20:37.194 --> 20:38.278
No.

20:43.826 --> 20:45.243
Octa.

20:52.126 --> 20:53.752
Anyone here?

20:56.672 --> 20:57.672
Whoa.

21:24.700 --> 21:28.912
Hey, Octa. l'm Darren.
l'm a big fan.

21:44.720 --> 21:47.138
We can speak in private.
lt's the only...

21:50.142 --> 21:53.520
We can talk in private.
The police have left now.

21:53.604 --> 21:56.106
So, this is what you've
been doing with your life.

21:56.190 --> 21:57.148
You didn't
like the act.

21:57.233 --> 21:58.274
l'm insane.
l'm insane. l'm insane.

21:58.359 --> 22:01.111
Well, l saw the
spider bit coming.

22:02.238 --> 22:03.530
Everybody's a critic.

22:03.614 --> 22:07.200
lt's not easy to hold an
audience's attention these days.

22:08.285 --> 22:11.454
To us and Charna's Guts.
To us and Charna's Guts.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.167
Did you see that
fingernail moon tonight?

22:16.252 --> 22:18.420
The first one
in 50 years.

22:19.630 --> 22:21.840
Yes. l noticed it.

22:23.009 --> 22:26.261
Look, Vincent's dead.

22:27.304 --> 22:29.639
Murdered. Sucked dry
by one of them.

22:33.728 --> 22:35.353
They're after us, man. They're
after us. They're after us!

22:35.438 --> 22:37.355
Those damn Vampaneze!
They're gonna pick us off.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.524
First Vincent,
then you, then me.

22:39.608 --> 22:41.359
Why me before you?

22:41.444 --> 22:44.696
Well, because l'm the toughest,
and they'll save me for last.

22:44.780 --> 22:46.781
Oh. Of course,
l forgot.

22:47.491 --> 22:48.825
Well, what about
the Vampire Council?

22:48.909 --> 22:50.618
They must have something
to say about Vincent.

22:50.703 --> 22:54.831
Yes. They say good riddance.
They're a bunch of wimps now, Larten.

22:54.915 --> 22:57.834
They'll do anything to avoid
a war with the Vampaneze.

22:57.918 --> 23:02.630
There are no real generals left, hombre.
You and l were the last of the Mo-Freakins!

23:02.715 --> 23:05.300
And to top it off,
Tiny's back.

23:06.719 --> 23:09.596
Mr. Tiny?
Back from the other side?

23:09.680 --> 23:13.767
Yes! Just last week he
was at the Council Library,

23:13.851 --> 23:16.061
messing with
the Book of Souls.

23:16.145 --> 23:17.812
He's trying
to destroy us all!

23:17.897 --> 23:20.982
Megalomaniac!
That man's a megalomaniac!

23:33.162 --> 23:37.165
And those murderous,
scumbag Vampaneze,

23:37.500 --> 23:40.585
they're up to something, too,
and it's all connected.

23:40.669 --> 23:42.879
lt's all connected.
l can feel it!

23:42.963 --> 23:46.341
Come with me.
We can avenge old Vincent.

23:46.425 --> 23:47.592
Kill us some Vampaneze!

23:47.676 --> 23:49.302
No. l'm sorry.

23:49.386 --> 23:51.304
No? Why?

23:53.099 --> 23:54.516
l'm done fighting.

23:54.600 --> 23:58.186
l left that life for a reason.
l'm just a vaudevillian.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.480
lt's a simple life,
and l like it.

24:02.191 --> 24:03.233
Steve.

24:03.317 --> 24:07.487
l know who you are. l know
what you are, Vur Horsten.

24:09.198 --> 24:13.451
Who sent you? The Apocalypse
Monger? The Blood Barons?

24:13.536 --> 24:15.662
No... No one. l... No
one sent me. l just...

24:15.746 --> 24:18.123
l have these vampire books,
and l saw a painting of him

24:18.207 --> 24:20.083
with some girl in,
like, 1819.

24:20.167 --> 24:23.753
lt said that she broke up with him
when she found he was a vampire.

24:25.005 --> 24:26.297
Did you hear
that, Gavner?

24:26.382 --> 24:29.425
Missy broke up with me
because l was a vampire.

24:29.510 --> 24:32.762
Funny, l always thought it was
the only thing she liked about me.

24:32.847 --> 24:34.931
Let the kid go.
Let him go.

24:36.475 --> 24:39.227
Now, are you
mentally unfit?

24:39.854 --> 24:42.814
Didn't you hear me
threaten you at the show?

24:42.898 --> 24:45.233
l did.
lt was awesome.

24:46.193 --> 24:51.573
You see, l want this. l want
you to make me into a vampire.

24:52.741 --> 24:55.827
l mean, vampires, they
don't take crap from anybody.

24:55.911 --> 24:57.662
They live by their
own set of rules.

24:57.746 --> 25:00.832
lt's true they do have their
own rules. We wrote some of them.

25:00.916 --> 25:05.044
Yes, and one of them is
children can't become vampires.

25:05.129 --> 25:06.337
Look, look, blood.

25:07.506 --> 25:08.756
Blood.

25:09.341 --> 25:12.343
You see, Gavner,
blood.

25:15.264 --> 25:17.849
Look, if you
become a vampire,

25:17.933 --> 25:20.894
you have to leave your
friends and your family.

25:20.978 --> 25:23.771
lt's deeply depressing.
Trust me.

25:25.065 --> 25:26.858
Now get out of here.

25:31.655 --> 25:33.948
l haven't seen
my dad in years.

25:36.118 --> 25:38.328
My mom is drunk
all the time.

25:39.788 --> 25:41.789
l absolutely hate my life.

25:43.792 --> 25:47.128
l never actually said it
before, but it's the truth.

25:49.006 --> 25:52.133
This is what
l was meant for.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.428
What you're
meant for?

25:57.640 --> 26:00.016
Well, if that's the case,
let's test your blood.

26:00.142 --> 26:01.309
No. No.

26:07.358 --> 26:10.944
Who sent you here?
Your blood tastes of evil.

26:14.031 --> 26:16.157
You can never
be a vampire.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.160
What?

26:19.245 --> 26:21.329
l have what, bad blood?

26:22.915 --> 26:25.041
l'm never gonna
forget this.

26:26.252 --> 26:28.920
One day, l promise you,
l will hunt you down.

26:29.004 --> 26:30.296
And what?

26:32.466 --> 26:33.675
Kill me?

26:34.718 --> 26:38.846
Do you know how easily l could
kill you? l could do it tonight.

26:39.390 --> 26:42.767
l could knock you out and
lay you in front of a bus,

26:42.851 --> 26:44.102
and no one
would ever know!

26:44.186 --> 26:48.773
Calm down. Save that stuff for
the enemy. He's just an idiot kid,

26:48.857 --> 26:51.567
who should be
leaving right now

26:52.611 --> 26:54.195
while he still can.

26:59.868 --> 27:01.744
You're out there, man.

27:02.538 --> 27:05.039
All right.
One for the road.

27:07.835 --> 27:09.669
l'm headed back
to the Mountain

27:09.753 --> 27:14.257
to try to convince those old cowards
to stand up against the Vampaneze.

27:14.341 --> 27:19.095
Gavner, if we kill one
of them, it means war.

27:20.889 --> 27:22.890
Wouldn't that
be a shame?

27:27.313 --> 27:28.938
Poor old Vincent.

27:30.566 --> 27:33.234
You've been awfully
quiet under there.

27:56.592 --> 27:57.800
Get in.

28:20.366 --> 28:24.285
Thanks. Thanks,
l really needed a ride.

28:24.828 --> 28:27.622
Oh, absolutely,
absolutely delighted.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.503
Are you the one
known as Steve?

28:35.130 --> 28:39.425
No, l'm the one
known as Darren.

28:39.510 --> 28:41.844
l actually had a bike.

28:41.929 --> 28:45.348
But l'll just get it
tomorrow in the daylight.

28:45.891 --> 28:48.976
No need.
lt's in the trunk.

28:49.561 --> 28:53.398
Now, if l
may ask, Darren,

28:54.608 --> 28:59.654
do you believe in the
immutability of the human soul?

29:01.657 --> 29:02.865
The what?

29:02.950 --> 29:06.077
So, he knows nothing
of souls, does he?

29:06.995 --> 29:09.622
Knows only
of blood, huh?

29:09.706 --> 29:13.876
The pulsing, the
delicious, the ruby red.

29:21.009 --> 29:24.971
Wow, wow, you know what? You
can just let me off right here.

29:25.431 --> 29:27.098
What's the rush?

29:27.182 --> 29:31.894
After all, didn't we save you
from the scary, scary vampire?

29:34.982 --> 29:38.776
Doesn't act like
leadership material.

29:38.861 --> 29:42.363
Acts more like a bag
of blood. Are you? Huh?

29:42.531 --> 29:43.656
Bag of blood?

29:43.740 --> 29:46.033
Shows how much
you know, Murlaugh.

29:46.118 --> 29:48.744
l think he reeks
of potential.

29:49.538 --> 29:51.289
Ow!
Sorry.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.041
Souvenir.

30:00.090 --> 30:03.301
We all have
a destiny, Darren.

30:03.385 --> 30:07.096
And with a few simple tests,
we can find out what yours is.

30:09.391 --> 30:11.601
Wonderful to
meet you, Darren.

30:12.394 --> 30:15.354
lt's like looking
in a mirror.

30:26.283 --> 30:27.492
Darren!

30:28.535 --> 30:30.203
We'll be in touch.

30:50.182 --> 30:53.100
Freaky dream.
Freaky. Freaky.

30:59.483 --> 31:02.568
Hey. Hey, l'm gonna try
to get you some food, okay?

31:02.653 --> 31:06.489
Just hold on one sec. l'm gonna go get
some flies from the window sill, okay?

31:06.573 --> 31:09.242
Hey. Why have you
been acting so weird?

31:11.453 --> 31:12.703
l'm not acting weird.

31:12.788 --> 31:13.746
You were just talking
to your backpack.

31:13.830 --> 31:14.872
What?

31:14.957 --> 31:16.707
No, l wasn't.
Darren, yes, you were.

31:16.792 --> 31:18.459
l wasn't. Let me... Just
let me see it a second.

31:18.585 --> 31:20.294
You see? lt's just my
backpack. Seriously, stop it.

31:20.420 --> 31:22.672
Hey, give me my backpack,
man. Hey, just let me see it.

31:25.175 --> 31:27.218
Holy shit! That's...
That's the...

31:27.302 --> 31:30.680
Yeah, l went back to the theater after
the show and l kind of borrowed it.

31:30.806 --> 31:33.599
You stole from a vampire? Do
you realize you're a dead man?

31:33.684 --> 31:34.934
Shh!
You're a dead man!

31:35.018 --> 31:36.394
He's never gonna find me.

31:36.478 --> 31:37.937
Okay, just...

31:38.772 --> 31:42.567
Wait a second. When did you
go to Vur Horsten's room,

31:42.651 --> 31:44.485
and what did you see?

31:47.823 --> 31:49.574
All right,
l saw everything.

31:49.658 --> 31:52.326
Steve, are you crazy? Why would
you want to become a vampire?

31:52.411 --> 31:56.289
Listen, you can't understand.
You have everything.

31:57.165 --> 32:00.167
What do l have?
A secret best friend?

32:04.715 --> 32:05.965
Hey, leave it
in there, okay?

32:06.049 --> 32:07.425
lt's fine.
l want to see it.

32:07.509 --> 32:13.097
Be careful. Hey, be careful,
okay? Be really careful.

32:16.685 --> 32:19.604
This thing's even
more hideous close up.

32:19.688 --> 32:20.730
Can you just put it
back now, please?

32:35.662 --> 32:37.538
Okay,
l need the pipe.

32:39.082 --> 32:41.208
GlRL: l got a B-minus
in history.

32:42.210 --> 32:43.210
No!

32:46.381 --> 32:48.132
Oh, my gosh,
what is that?

33:01.897 --> 33:03.022
Move!

33:03.106 --> 33:04.231
Steve! Wait!

33:04.983 --> 33:06.400
What's going on?

33:19.122 --> 33:21.540
Move! Get out of
the way, idiots!

33:23.752 --> 33:26.837
Watch out! Move!

33:27.964 --> 33:29.632
Hey! Steve, don't!

33:32.010 --> 33:34.512
Now l got you!
Hold still!

33:35.722 --> 33:38.933
What's the matter with you?
Whose side are you on?

33:45.399 --> 33:47.858
Hey! No! Hey!

33:58.787 --> 34:01.080
GlRL: Guys, look,
it's in his shirt!

34:05.252 --> 34:06.419
Get it off me!

34:06.503 --> 34:07.962
GlRL: Oh, my God!

34:47.793 --> 34:51.338
So what have you come to
steal from me this time? Thief!

34:51.882 --> 34:53.924
Nothing. Nothing.

34:54.009 --> 34:59.013
Look, Octa bit my best friend,
Steve, and he's in the hospital,

34:59.431 --> 35:01.223
in a coma,
because of me.

35:01.308 --> 35:04.435
And l was wondering
if you had an antidote.

35:04.519 --> 35:05.853
l do.

35:05.937 --> 35:07.062
Thank you.

35:07.147 --> 35:09.690
But l only have
a couple doses left.

35:09.775 --> 35:13.277
Why should l waste any
on some little psychopath?

35:13.361 --> 35:15.488
Please, l'm begging
you, okay?

35:15.572 --> 35:18.032
Look, l'm really sorry
l stole Octa.

35:18.700 --> 35:21.660
l don't know what came over
me. l never steal things.

35:22.078 --> 35:23.245
Why not?

35:24.206 --> 35:25.247
Because it's wrong.

35:25.332 --> 35:27.625
So then you've learned
a valuable moral lesson.

35:27.709 --> 35:28.751
Yes, l have.

35:28.835 --> 35:32.379
And you'll never do anything
wrong again, as long as you live.

35:32.464 --> 35:33.589
No, l won't.

35:33.673 --> 35:36.884
You see? Now you're
a thief and a liar.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.595
What did
Mr. Tiny want?

35:40.222 --> 35:41.222
Mr. Tiny?

35:41.306 --> 35:43.015
The fat man
in the limousine!

35:44.893 --> 35:48.395
l don't know, something about
souls and... And destiny.

35:49.105 --> 35:50.147
And he knew
where l lived.

35:50.232 --> 35:53.984
Looks like you're in deep
shit, my larcenous friend.

35:54.069 --> 35:57.530
Mr. Tiny doesn't just take
a random interest in people.

35:57.614 --> 36:01.742
And the people he does take an
interest in wind up dead or worse.

36:05.956 --> 36:07.873
What's worse than dead?

36:09.417 --> 36:10.417
Oh.

36:11.378 --> 36:12.920
Lots of things.

36:17.592 --> 36:21.971
All right. l'll do it.
l'll make you a bargain.

36:23.265 --> 36:26.851
You'll become my assistant. l'll
turn you into a half vampire.

36:26.935 --> 36:30.187
You'll be able to go out in the
daylight, very useful for me.

36:30.272 --> 36:33.691
You'll do chores for me and
guard my coffin on the road.

36:33.775 --> 36:37.486
And in return, l'll try and
keep Mr. Tiny away from you.

36:37.571 --> 36:40.489
Oh, and l'll save
your stupid friend Steve,

36:40.574 --> 36:43.659
despite the fact that
he threatened to kill me.

36:48.623 --> 36:49.748
You'll save Steve?

36:49.833 --> 36:50.875
Why not?

36:54.921 --> 36:59.133
lf l became a half vampire,
would l have to kill people?

37:00.302 --> 37:01.927
lnterested, huh?

37:02.596 --> 37:06.724
Vampires don't kill the people
they feed on. Vampaneze do.

37:06.808 --> 37:10.811
Big source of controversy, war
for about 80 years, then a truce,

37:10.896 --> 37:14.148
getting ugly again,
apparently. But time's wasting.

37:17.652 --> 37:19.653
Want to become a vampire?

37:20.822 --> 37:24.325
lt's a lonely life,
but there's lots of it.

37:25.160 --> 37:27.745
l can't make that
decision right now.

37:30.624 --> 37:33.584
Do you wanna go home and
ask your mommy and daddy?

37:33.668 --> 37:37.463
Do they make all the decisions
for good little boys like you?

37:37.839 --> 37:39.340
No, they don't.

37:42.010 --> 37:44.678
Poor Steve doesn't
have much time left.

37:51.978 --> 37:56.523
Fine, l'll do it. To save my
friend, not for any other reason.

37:57.609 --> 37:59.151
So get the antidote.

37:59.235 --> 38:00.486
Right here.

38:02.697 --> 38:04.698
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

38:04.783 --> 38:05.991
First things first.

38:07.202 --> 38:09.078
Let's test your blood.

38:10.705 --> 38:13.874
What are you doing? l'm not gonna bite you
in the jugular. l could kill you that way.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.709
Show me your hands.

38:19.547 --> 38:20.547
Ow!

38:21.508 --> 38:22.508
Mmm.

38:23.218 --> 38:27.388
You have good blood. This will
work. All right, hold up your hands.

38:27.514 --> 38:29.556
We're going
to exchange blood.

38:29.641 --> 38:30.808
That's creepy.

38:30.892 --> 38:33.310
l know. But that's
how it's done.

38:43.863 --> 38:46.657
This may hurt when
it gets to your heart.

39:00.171 --> 39:01.547
l feel cold.

39:03.425 --> 39:05.092
Lick your fingers.

39:15.186 --> 39:18.480
Whoa, is that like vampire
power? Do l have super-spit now?

39:18.565 --> 39:22.151
Yes, you have super-spit.
The rest will take a while.

39:24.529 --> 39:26.113
The rest of what?
What will l be able to do?

39:26.197 --> 39:27.865
Can l, like, turn into a bat and stuff?

39:27.949 --> 39:29.950
No, that's bullshit.

39:30.910 --> 39:33.620
Now hop on my back.
We're going to flit.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.080
We're gonna what?

39:35.165 --> 39:37.458
Just shut up
and hop on my back.

39:48.845 --> 39:51.388
You held your
breath, right?

39:51.473 --> 39:53.682
Did l not tell you
to hold your breath?

39:53.808 --> 39:55.059
Oh...

39:55.143 --> 39:56.310
Sorry.

40:01.649 --> 40:03.275
Hold on.

40:03.359 --> 40:05.527
Why didn't we just
take the elevator?

40:05.612 --> 40:07.613
l get claustrophobic.

40:07.697 --> 40:10.491
Strange, huh, given
where l sleep every night.

40:10.575 --> 40:14.328
But somehow when it's my own
confined space, it's different.

40:15.371 --> 40:18.957
He looks horrible. Can you
give him the antidote, please?

40:23.630 --> 40:25.714
She really
didn't like him.

40:28.426 --> 40:29.843
Be careful.

40:40.438 --> 40:42.397
Hey, what are you doing?

40:46.194 --> 40:47.194
Shh.

40:58.706 --> 41:00.999
That's it, right?
He's gonna be better now?

41:01.084 --> 41:02.084
That's it.

41:10.844 --> 41:12.052
You are insufferable.

41:12.137 --> 41:13.470
Back! Stay back!

41:13.555 --> 41:14.596
Code blue...

41:14.681 --> 41:17.599
You have no idea how
ridiculous you look right now.

41:17.684 --> 41:18.809
Code blue...

41:18.893 --> 41:22.020
All right. lf you want to pretend
this isn't happening, fine.

41:22.105 --> 41:25.399
But being a vampire takes
skill. What is a code blue?

41:25.483 --> 41:27.025
Code bIue, code bIue...

41:27.110 --> 41:29.778
Try not to do something
stupid like kill your family.

41:29.863 --> 41:33.031
Code bIue, code bIue,
room 519, stat.

41:33.116 --> 41:35.159
You are not supposed
to be in here!

41:35.243 --> 41:38.245
Code blue. All available
staff please report to room...

41:45.670 --> 41:46.670
lt must have hurt.

41:46.754 --> 41:47.921
Yeah, it hurt.

41:49.048 --> 41:50.757
lt wasn't...
lt wasn't fun.

41:50.842 --> 41:52.009
lt's great
you're back.

41:52.093 --> 41:53.177
Yeah.
We missed you.

41:53.261 --> 41:56.305
Well, well, well,
Steve is back, huh?

41:56.389 --> 42:00.559
So, Steve, what
you got for me?

42:10.945 --> 42:14.364
Stay away from those
brownies. They're for dessert.

42:14.490 --> 42:16.491
Okay.
No brownies.

42:16.576 --> 42:17.618
Next...

42:28.963 --> 42:33.550
Hey, Darren, do you think that this
outfit looks better on her, or this?

42:37.055 --> 42:38.430
What's going on?

42:42.810 --> 42:45.604
You look weird.
Darren.

42:46.898 --> 42:47.898
Darren!

42:51.986 --> 42:52.986
Sorry.

42:54.030 --> 42:57.115
Sorry, l... l was just
pretending to be a vampire.

43:05.208 --> 43:06.667
Nice room.

43:08.002 --> 43:10.504
Some excellent reading
material you have here.

43:10.588 --> 43:13.340
Thought this was all
on the lnternet now.

43:13.841 --> 43:15.050
Mine's blocked.

43:15.134 --> 43:16.134
Hmm.

43:17.845 --> 43:21.348
Don't... No, don't
do that. Don't cry.

43:22.392 --> 43:24.518
Honestly. Stop, stop.
No.

43:25.019 --> 43:26.186
l'm not crying.

43:26.271 --> 43:28.105
Of course not.
That's what...

43:29.315 --> 43:32.943
Look, l don't want to hurt
people, okay? l'm not like you.

43:33.194 --> 43:35.279
l was this close away
from killing my sister.

43:35.363 --> 43:39.533
Perhaps you should have thought
of that before you stole my spider!

43:41.536 --> 43:44.955
Look, l'm sorry,
but you can't stay here.

43:45.039 --> 43:46.581
You're going to
have to leave them.

43:48.376 --> 43:49.918
Like forever?

43:50.003 --> 43:51.378
Like forever.

43:53.006 --> 43:55.924
lt's time to admit that
to yourself, Darren.

44:04.350 --> 44:06.351
But you can't
just leave.

44:07.270 --> 44:09.187
You're going to
have to die first.

44:18.656 --> 44:20.282
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

44:20.408 --> 44:21.408
Hmm?

44:24.412 --> 44:25.996
Hi. Hi.

44:28.249 --> 44:32.336
Hey, l just wanted to say that you
guys are really, really good parents.

44:32.420 --> 44:36.840
You're doing a great job, and l'm
sorry for not doing all my chores

44:36.924 --> 44:39.092
and for complaining
so much.

44:40.511 --> 44:43.305
And l love you
guys a lot.

44:43.389 --> 44:45.098
We love you,
too, sweetie.

44:57.362 --> 44:58.779
Bye, Annie.

45:03.951 --> 45:06.787
How old were you when
you became a vampire?

45:08.122 --> 45:11.792
Twenty. lt was 1803,
the third of May.

45:12.960 --> 45:16.171
l'd just been left by my
fiancÃ©e, Hesther Collins.

45:16.798 --> 45:19.925
l thought she was the most
beautiful girl in Baltimore.

45:20.009 --> 45:23.553
l saw her again 60 years
later. She was an old crone,

45:24.972 --> 45:27.808
but my heart still
beat like a jackrabbit.

45:30.395 --> 45:33.146
Wow, dumped, huh?

45:33.731 --> 45:36.608
So big, bad, old Crepsley became
a vampire 'cause he got dumped?

45:38.653 --> 45:40.695
Have you ever
been dumped?

45:42.949 --> 45:44.366
Yeah.

45:44.450 --> 45:47.661
Then perhaps you should
be more sympathetic.

45:47.787 --> 45:50.914
Here it is.
Drink up.

46:05.304 --> 46:06.430
My lips are numb.

46:06.514 --> 46:07.556
Good.

46:10.685 --> 46:12.936
l've got pins and
needles in my hands.

46:13.020 --> 46:15.439
Excellent. That means it's working.

46:20.319 --> 46:22.279
Nice night,
actually.

46:23.865 --> 46:26.658
ls that the Little Dipper or the
Big one? l can never remember.

46:28.119 --> 46:29.536
Sorry about that.

46:29.620 --> 46:33.039
l had to do that or they would never
believe you were dead. Don't worry.

46:33.124 --> 46:35.208
There's no damage
to your spinal cord,

46:35.293 --> 46:37.961
and l'll sneak into the funeral
home and fix your broken neck.

46:38.045 --> 46:41.715
Oh, and sorry about
this next part.

46:59.066 --> 47:00.317
Darren,

47:01.819 --> 47:05.739
l hate you so much for leaving
me here with these idiots.

47:18.544 --> 47:21.630
Darren.
Hey, Shan!

47:22.798 --> 47:24.966
Asswipe, are you in
there? Darren! Steve.

47:25.051 --> 47:29.095
Okay, time out, time out. Not
about you. We're all feeling grief.

48:21.816 --> 48:23.149
Wake-y, wake-y.

48:24.569 --> 48:26.361
Here.
Fill that hole.

48:26.529 --> 48:30.282
l can't do that. l'm all cramped
up. My legs are still numb.

48:30.658 --> 48:31.825
Can you feel this?

48:31.909 --> 48:33.660
Ow! What the heck?

48:38.332 --> 48:40.709
Do you smell
a rotting corpse?

48:40.793 --> 48:42.168
Ha, ha, very funny.

48:43.045 --> 48:44.588
Get back in the grave.

48:44.672 --> 48:45.964
l'm not getting
back in the grave.

48:46.048 --> 48:47.757
Don't argue
with me. Get in.

48:47.842 --> 48:48.883
No.

48:58.019 --> 49:02.939
Hello, old friend. Old
Crepsley. How's the scar?

49:03.566 --> 49:06.234
Shall l give
you another?

49:58.287 --> 50:00.580
Hello,
bag of blood.

50:02.124 --> 50:03.917
You're coming with me.

50:11.467 --> 50:12.467
Run!

50:28.526 --> 50:31.695
You come with Murlaugh now.
You're one of us.

50:32.279 --> 50:34.864
Not one of those
filthy vampires.

50:36.117 --> 50:37.617
Let me go!

50:38.953 --> 50:40.954
Where are we going?

50:49.422 --> 50:50.463
Hold your breath.

50:50.548 --> 50:52.215
What? No, no,
no, no, no, no.

51:04.228 --> 51:05.270
Let's go!

51:05.354 --> 51:06.730
Not yet!

51:12.361 --> 51:14.237
Don't look behind you.

51:19.660 --> 51:23.538
Oh, my God. Oh, my
God! Are you all right?

51:24.999 --> 51:26.332
Come here!

51:31.881 --> 51:34.132
Breathe.

51:34.759 --> 51:37.177
GlRL 1: Right over
the plate!

51:37.261 --> 51:39.512
GlRL 2: Oh, my God.

51:39.597 --> 51:41.014
Do you know
those guys?

51:43.142 --> 51:44.601
Are we there yet?

51:44.685 --> 51:45.769
Almost.

51:51.400 --> 51:52.650
Where are we?

51:52.985 --> 51:54.861
The Cirque's
winter campgrounds.

51:54.945 --> 51:57.030
You'll be safe here
if they let you stay.

51:57.698 --> 51:59.324
Try to fit in.

52:02.036 --> 52:03.203
Come on.

52:03.287 --> 52:04.579
So all the freaks
live here?

52:05.289 --> 52:06.456
Yes.

52:13.672 --> 52:15.089
Don't stare.

52:20.554 --> 52:23.389
lt's really...

52:34.568 --> 52:37.070
You want to go to my tent? You
know, we can rehearse in my tent.

52:37.154 --> 52:39.239
l'm not gonna
rehearse in your tent.

52:39.365 --> 52:42.784
lt'll be great, you know. You
always have fun in my tent.

52:48.791 --> 52:50.416
Wait here for me.

52:51.544 --> 52:53.211
Well, l was
thinking about it.

52:53.295 --> 52:55.004
l mean, you're not gonna be
able to do this forever, right?

52:55.089 --> 52:57.173
lf you set everything up,
so l can just fill it out.

52:57.258 --> 53:00.927
Neutral. The Cirque has
always remained neutral.

53:01.262 --> 53:03.221
That's how it has
survived all these years.

53:03.305 --> 53:05.723
You'll still
be neutral.

53:05.808 --> 53:09.519
l'm not trying to drag you into anything.
l'm trying to keep myself out of it.

53:09.603 --> 53:12.522
And why exactly do you
think Tiny wants this boy?

53:12.606 --> 53:14.232
l'm not sure yet.

53:14.775 --> 53:16.526
But whenever Mr. Tiny
wants something,

53:16.610 --> 53:19.362
l make it my policy to try
and keep him from it.

53:19.446 --> 53:21.656
That's a
dangerous policy.

53:27.955 --> 53:30.665
Hey, what are you doing?
That's Mr. Tall's tent.

53:32.209 --> 53:33.960
Hi, l'm Darren.

53:34.044 --> 53:35.461
What are you
doing here?

53:36.964 --> 53:38.298
That's what l'm trying
to figure out.

53:39.133 --> 53:41.217
You can listen
if you want.

53:44.471 --> 53:45.930
How much does
the boy know?

53:46.015 --> 53:47.557
Nothing.

53:47.641 --> 53:51.060
He's waiting by my tent if
you want to speak with him.

53:51.145 --> 53:55.398
You know, Larten, the thing you
might not realize about children is,

53:56.358 --> 53:59.819
they don't always do
what they're told!

54:01.196 --> 54:04.157
Rebecca. Don't you have
work you should be doing?

54:04.241 --> 54:07.744
Yes. Sorry, Mr. Tall. lt won't happen
again. l mean, l don't eavesdrop on people.

54:07.828 --> 54:08.953
lt was his idea.

54:09.038 --> 54:10.455
l didn't make you
do anything.

54:10.539 --> 54:12.332
Well, you couldn't make me
do anything if you tried.

54:12.416 --> 54:13.499
Oh, really, huh?

54:13.584 --> 54:14.876
Enough. Rebecca,

54:15.753 --> 54:18.713
l would like you to take
Darren to Evra's tent.

54:18.797 --> 54:21.841
Evra will be his roommate
while he stays with us.

54:22.760 --> 54:26.346
You'll have to work, Darren.
Everybody here pitches in.

54:26.889 --> 54:28.097
That's fine.

54:28.182 --> 54:32.894
l actually worked for my dad's
office a couple of weeks this summer.

54:32.978 --> 54:35.021
l did photocopies, so...

54:39.151 --> 54:43.780
This is on a temporary basis, Larten. l
can't endanger everybody for your sake.

54:43.864 --> 54:45.698
Of course.
Thank you.

54:46.951 --> 54:49.827
So, what are you doing here
anyway, with all these freaks?

54:49.912 --> 54:53.331
Why? Do you have
a problem with freaks?

54:53.415 --> 54:57.585
No, l mean, they kind
of freak me out, but...

54:57.670 --> 55:00.380
They freak you out.
Clever, really clever.

55:01.590 --> 55:04.842
Well, l really have to get back to
work. Harkat can show you the way.

55:05.636 --> 55:08.221
Harkat, take Darren
to Evra's tent, please.

55:14.895 --> 55:17.021
Well, you better
follow him.

55:21.777 --> 55:23.778
Okay, see you sometime.

55:28.075 --> 55:31.577
No, l saw what you did to my friend
Steve's hand at the theater, buddy.

55:37.584 --> 55:40.461
Dude, l'm not giving
you my hand, okay?

55:45.718 --> 55:47.343
l'm sorry. Here.

55:50.264 --> 55:51.514
Harkat!

55:51.598 --> 55:55.852
You have to stop biting people, or
no one will want to be around you.

56:01.358 --> 56:02.442
You.

56:06.739 --> 56:07.905
Death.

56:09.408 --> 56:12.785
Redemption. Despair.

56:15.414 --> 56:18.458
Triumph. Disaster.

56:21.211 --> 56:22.795
What did l say?

56:23.464 --> 56:26.799
"Death, redemption,
despair, triumph, disaster."

56:28.510 --> 56:33.389
Well, don't worry about it. Go
ahead, Harkat. Take him to Evra's.

56:33.891 --> 56:35.641
And no more teeth.

56:46.278 --> 56:48.488
You mean, this is it?

56:49.198 --> 56:53.951
Chill in the laundry for a
sec. There you go. Good girl.

56:56.038 --> 56:59.332
Good snake. Love you.

57:02.669 --> 57:06.714
So, l guess we're gonna be
roommates. So how are you f'd up?

57:08.175 --> 57:09.509
F'd up?
Freaked up.

57:09.593 --> 57:11.302
How... What kind
of freak are you?

57:11.386 --> 57:14.347
Oh, l'm not a freak.
l'm normal.

57:15.682 --> 57:16.724
You're normal?

57:16.809 --> 57:17.892
No. l mean,
l'm half vampire,

57:17.976 --> 57:19.685
but l'm completely
normal.

57:19.770 --> 57:22.647
You're a half vampire,
but you're normal.

57:24.316 --> 57:25.691
l like that.

57:26.735 --> 57:30.530
And don't worry about, like, if l'm
gonna drink your blood or anything.

57:30.614 --> 57:33.866
l'm not gonna drink
anyone's blood.

57:36.537 --> 57:38.704
What a relief. Okay,
this isn't awkward at all.

57:38.789 --> 57:41.165
This is your corner
of the tent. All right?

57:41.250 --> 57:43.417
You do not cross over to
any other part of the tent,

57:43.502 --> 57:46.170
except to enter and
exit the tent. All right?

57:46.255 --> 57:50.466
And you are never, ever to touch my
stuff, especially this stuff over here.

57:50.551 --> 57:52.718
This is my
recording studio.

57:52.886 --> 57:56.347
Oh, cool. Yeah, l... l actually
used to have a drum set,

57:57.724 --> 57:59.934
but, you know, my parents
made me give it away, so...

58:00.018 --> 58:01.853
Mmm.
Yeah.

58:01.937 --> 58:04.272
Well, there are
no parents here.

58:07.151 --> 58:08.151
Oh...

58:10.946 --> 58:14.198
Yeah. Shedding,
itches like crazy.

58:14.741 --> 58:16.868
You should actually go wash your
hand off before you get pink eye.

58:18.829 --> 58:22.707
Did you forget to tell me you were going
to go away for a couple of days? Huh?

58:23.041 --> 58:26.127
l can't believe you're treating me
like this. l've been worried sick.

58:26.211 --> 58:27.837
Why can't you just
get a cell phone?

58:27.921 --> 58:29.589
Because vampires
don't need cell phones.

58:29.715 --> 58:33.926
"Vampires don't need this,
vampires don't need that."

58:34.011 --> 58:36.179
l'll tell you what
vampires need.

58:36.263 --> 58:39.473
They need to listen. Didn't l
tell you that l had a foreboding?

58:39.558 --> 58:42.852
And what do you do? You
show up here with that kid.

58:42.936 --> 58:45.771
lt's been a long night. l
just flitted across two states.

58:45.856 --> 58:47.940
l think l'll just hit
the pine early.

58:48.066 --> 58:49.358
No, wait.

58:51.695 --> 58:54.947
You don't love me
anymore. lt's my beard.

58:56.283 --> 58:59.827
You know how l feel about you. l
just don't want to outlive anyone.

58:59.912 --> 59:04.624
lt's depressing watching people you
care about grow old while you stay young.

59:06.001 --> 59:07.710
Have you looked at yourself
in the mirror lately?

59:08.879 --> 59:10.463
You're no kid.

59:11.924 --> 59:15.051
Oh, no, no. l'm still
angry at you. Mmm-mmm.

59:15.219 --> 59:17.303
Mmm-mmm.

59:17.596 --> 59:21.891
Your mouth says no,
but your beard says yes.

59:22.684 --> 59:24.060
l can't believe
he's gone, man.

59:24.144 --> 59:25.728
l know. He was
like my best friend.

59:25.812 --> 59:27.230
No, he was
my best friend.

59:27.314 --> 59:28.940
l knew him first.
So what?

59:29.024 --> 59:30.983
l thought he
was a dick.

59:31.068 --> 59:32.735
What?
What?

59:33.028 --> 59:34.528
Dude.
Oh, my...

59:34.613 --> 59:37.448
Here, get up before one of the
teachers see you. That kid's psycho.

59:42.496 --> 59:47.458
Mr. Leonard, what you got for
me here? Finish the quiz already?

59:59.888 --> 01:00:01.347
MR. TlNY: Careful.
Whoa!

01:00:02.683 --> 01:00:04.809
The first step
is a big one.

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:09.772
Oh, l know. You miss
the one known as Darren.

01:00:09.856 --> 01:00:15.361
You feel betrayed, abandoned.
You're a loyal friend,

01:00:16.363 --> 01:00:17.738
unlike him.

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:21.784
Darren was
a loyal friend.

01:00:21.868 --> 01:00:23.536
Oh, really?

01:00:23.954 --> 01:00:28.624
What if l told you he's still
alive? He's taken your place,

01:00:28.709 --> 01:00:32.461
stealing your dreams. Oh, l know.

01:00:32.546 --> 01:00:36.132
You dream of killing people,
drinking their blood.

01:00:36.216 --> 01:00:41.012
You dream of leading a
great, bloodthirsty army.

01:00:41.096 --> 01:00:42.888
Who the hell are you?

01:00:43.515 --> 01:00:45.266
l'm Mr. Tiny.

01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:46.726
Are you a vampire?

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:50.438
No, l'm not a vampire.
l'm not a Vampaneze.

01:00:50.522 --> 01:00:53.232
l'm an aficionado.

01:00:54.401 --> 01:00:58.070
l want to see
a marvelous war.

01:00:58.155 --> 01:01:00.698
What do you want
from me, you freak?

01:01:01.074 --> 01:01:05.786
l'm not a freak.
l despise freaks.

01:01:05.871 --> 01:01:09.165
Can a freak travel back and
forth between life and death?

01:01:09.249 --> 01:01:10.666
l think not.

01:01:10.751 --> 01:01:14.670
Can a freak create new life from
rotting flesh and dead souls?

01:01:14.755 --> 01:01:15.921
Please.

01:01:16.006 --> 01:01:21.510
Can a freak bring about the
apocalypse and rule the world?

01:01:22.262 --> 01:01:23.596
No.

01:01:24.973 --> 01:01:30.853
Sadly, neither can l, not
without help. l need a champion.

01:01:31.772 --> 01:01:36.400
One of two boys,
two dear friends.

01:01:38.028 --> 01:01:41.864
And by the way,
l love your DNA.

01:01:48.872 --> 01:01:50.790
You care
for a pancake?

01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:53.042
No, l can't. l'm...

01:01:53.126 --> 01:01:54.752
We know
what you are.

01:01:55.587 --> 01:01:57.380
You're bad news.
That's what.

01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:02.927
But nothing l couldn't deal
with in just about two bites.

01:02:04.346 --> 01:02:07.348
Don't mind him. He
just needs some Ex-Lax.

01:02:07.432 --> 01:02:08.891
Welcome to
the Cirque.

01:02:08.975 --> 01:02:10.309
Thank you.

01:02:10.811 --> 01:02:13.396
Would you like to eat one of
my hands? l can grow them back.

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:14.605
Yeah, they
are delicious.

01:02:14.689 --> 01:02:16.732
Hey, Vampelina.

01:02:16.817 --> 01:02:18.526
Come on, we gotta go
clean out Wolfie's cage,

01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:22.696
and then Crepsley left, like, a
list of stuff for you to do for him.

01:02:22.781 --> 01:02:24.156
lt looks like you're
Crepsley's bitch now.

01:02:24.241 --> 01:02:25.574
Evra.
What?

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:34.625
Okay, so you guys are
gonna do it. And go.

01:02:43.677 --> 01:02:46.429
l can't believe the tiny
people eat these rats.

01:02:46.513 --> 01:02:48.180
They'll eat you
if you don't watch out.

01:02:48.306 --> 01:02:49.849
Don't!

01:03:06.867 --> 01:03:09.326
So where do you
come from anyways?

01:03:21.715 --> 01:03:23.716
l guess l could probably,
like, open this up,

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:27.136
and you'd probably turn
into dust or something, huh?

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:30.514
You wouldn't like that
now, would you, Dracula?

01:03:30.599 --> 01:03:32.141
Who's the boss
now, baby?

01:03:33.226 --> 01:03:37.396
Okay. Concentrate now.
How hard can it be to flit?

01:03:52.078 --> 01:03:54.455
Ow. Perfect.

01:04:14.392 --> 01:04:16.018
What's the point?

01:04:23.735 --> 01:04:26.820
l'm just not that
much of a freak.

01:04:26.905 --> 01:04:28.614
Gertha, you're
a major freak.

01:04:34.746 --> 01:04:37.456
Sorry, you're
not my type.

01:04:38.792 --> 01:04:40.960
Do you ever
miss your family?

01:04:43.755 --> 01:04:44.964
Not really.

01:04:45.048 --> 01:04:48.008
l joined the Cirque when l
was two. Two days old, that is.

01:04:48.093 --> 01:04:51.929
Mr. Tall found me in a dumpster.
So l guess this is my family.

01:04:54.224 --> 01:04:57.977
Dumpster baby,
oh, dumpster baby

01:04:58.061 --> 01:05:01.564
l wanna be your
dumpster baby

01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:05.276
No.

01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:27.423
Hey, this is Steve.
You know what to do.

01:05:30.885 --> 01:05:32.094
What are you doing?

01:05:32.178 --> 01:05:33.304
Oh, nothing.

01:05:34.556 --> 01:05:36.015
May l see it?

01:05:37.684 --> 01:05:38.934
Yeah, l guess.

01:05:39.019 --> 01:05:40.853
l've always wanted
one of these.

01:05:42.188 --> 01:05:44.398
Hey! What are
you doing?

01:05:44.482 --> 01:05:47.109
We must be very careful
who we talk to, Darren.

01:06:04.044 --> 01:06:06.879
Go to your tent
and stay there with Evra.

01:06:22.729 --> 01:06:26.023
Yes. l have returned.

01:06:30.195 --> 01:06:33.030
l have returned!

01:06:34.074 --> 01:06:38.869
Unacceptable. Unforgivable.
To blood a child?

01:06:41.331 --> 01:06:43.999
By the way, is he drinking
enough blood?

01:06:44.084 --> 01:06:46.168
He's not drinking
any blood.

01:06:46.252 --> 01:06:47.586
Not drinking blood?

01:06:48.338 --> 01:06:51.256
Crepsley, don't you know
he has to? He must.

01:06:52.759 --> 01:06:55.928
Or perhaps you're worried
he'll love it too much.

01:06:58.431 --> 01:07:00.391
He might be
Vampaneze at heart.

01:07:00.475 --> 01:07:02.142
You'd like that.

01:07:02.227 --> 01:07:04.520
You've been favoring them
for the last 100 years.

01:07:04.604 --> 01:07:09.692
On the contrary, l'm strictly
neutral, like the Cirque.

01:07:09.776 --> 01:07:11.944
Correct, Mr. Tall?

01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:15.030
Correct.

01:07:16.282 --> 01:07:18.409
Then tell us
why you want him.

01:07:18.493 --> 01:07:21.870
lt's one of your self-fulfilling
prophecies, isn't it?

01:07:21.955 --> 01:07:24.790
Well, one does dream
of the cataclysm.

01:07:27.419 --> 01:07:31.046
This truce may
not last forever.

01:07:31.131 --> 01:07:34.299
There might be new leaders.
New blood, as it were.

01:07:35.176 --> 01:07:39.138
Perhaps a boy,
a bloodthirsty boy.

01:07:40.515 --> 01:07:42.808
lt's all been written.

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:46.145
Then why do you care? You're
up to something, Desmond.

01:07:46.229 --> 01:07:50.399
Me? l may
write the script,

01:07:50.483 --> 01:07:54.528
but the characters have a
tendency to do as they please.

01:07:54.612 --> 01:07:58.824
You, for example, have an
unseemly amount of free will.

01:07:58.908 --> 01:08:04.496
Now, Mr. Tall, will you be
reasonable and give me the child?

01:08:04.998 --> 01:08:09.084
l've always done what you ask.
l'm not one to cause trouble.

01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:17.091
But l need to think about all this.
l won't make a decision hastily.

01:08:17.176 --> 01:08:20.845
You know, l always get
what l want, in the end.

01:08:31.064 --> 01:08:34.526
MR. TlNY: Keep an eye
on him, my pets.

01:08:45.872 --> 01:08:49.541
Hey, dude. Sorry,
we're on our own today.

01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:52.961
Rebecca's back in
the costume shop.

01:09:14.651 --> 01:09:16.902
Hey.

01:09:18.071 --> 01:09:20.322
l'm here for
Crepsley's cape.

01:09:20.406 --> 01:09:21.657
lt's that red one
with, like, the...

01:09:21.741 --> 01:09:23.992
l know what Crepsley's
cape looks like.

01:09:24.077 --> 01:09:26.078
What do your
friends want?

01:09:28.331 --> 01:09:29.790
Hey! Beat it!

01:09:32.877 --> 01:09:34.711
Does this trailer have, like,
a back entrance or something?

01:09:34.796 --> 01:09:38.340
Yeah, it's right back there.
Wait, your pants are ripped.

01:09:38.424 --> 01:09:42.594
Take them off.
Try this pair on.

01:09:44.514 --> 01:09:46.055
They fit.

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:47.307
Yeah.

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:55.941
So, you know,
Rebecca, you...

01:09:56.943 --> 01:10:00.529
You never really told me what
you're doing here with the Cirque.

01:10:00.613 --> 01:10:03.448
Well, Darren,
since you ask,

01:10:04.951 --> 01:10:06.577
l'm a monkey girl.

01:10:07.912 --> 01:10:08.912
You're a what?

01:10:08.997 --> 01:10:10.080
What?

01:10:10.164 --> 01:10:13.458
Nothing, l thought you just
said you were a monkey girl.

01:10:13.543 --> 01:10:15.085
Well, oh, yeah.

01:10:17.088 --> 01:10:18.171
Yeah.

01:10:21.926 --> 01:10:24.303
What does that mean?

01:10:24.387 --> 01:10:28.640
lt means l have a tail. Do
you have a problem with that?

01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:33.937
No, because... 'Cause
you're joking, right?

01:10:34.022 --> 01:10:38.650
No, l'm not joking. l keep it wrapped
up because people kept stepping on it.

01:10:40.486 --> 01:10:41.486
Oh.

01:10:41.779 --> 01:10:42.863
Yeah.

01:10:42.947 --> 01:10:46.617
Anyway, your pants
look really good.

01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:51.496
Yeah, l know. You picked
it out. That's really good.

01:10:59.339 --> 01:11:00.339
Shush!

01:11:01.132 --> 01:11:03.967
Thanks. They've been
spying on me all day.

01:11:06.471 --> 01:11:10.599
So if you were interested in a
girl, okay, and she had like...

01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:15.437
Like a tail, let's say,
would that be a problem or...

01:11:15.521 --> 01:11:17.564
Well, l'll put it
to you this way.

01:11:17.649 --> 01:11:19.441
lf you had told me a
couple hundred years ago

01:11:19.525 --> 01:11:22.444
that l would someday be dating a
woman with bristles on her chin,

01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:26.239
l would have told you you
were insane. But here we are.

01:11:28.618 --> 01:11:32.621
By the way, there's a new rule.
You're not to leave camp anymore.

01:11:33.164 --> 01:11:34.164
Why not?

01:11:34.248 --> 01:11:35.582
Because l said so.

01:11:37.877 --> 01:11:41.380
You're not my dad. You can't
just tell me what to do...

01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:47.010
When was the last time
you were in a fight?

01:11:47.095 --> 01:11:48.345
Uh...
Second grade.

01:11:49.389 --> 01:11:51.306
Steve's usually the one
that gets in all the fights.

01:11:51.391 --> 01:11:53.976
Well, Steve's not
here to fight for you.

01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:56.228
And what if
l wasn't, either?

01:11:57.188 --> 01:12:00.315
What if you were alone in the dark
and someone wanted to kill you?

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:03.276
Rip out your heart
and drink its blood?

01:12:03.361 --> 01:12:04.695
What then?

01:12:08.741 --> 01:12:10.033
Crepsley?

01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:14.329
Crepsley,
come on.

01:12:18.209 --> 01:12:19.459
Crepsley?

01:12:25.633 --> 01:12:26.717
You're hurting me.

01:12:26.801 --> 01:12:30.053
What are you going
to do about it? Well?

01:12:35.226 --> 01:12:38.603
You're soft. You're a soft little boy.

01:12:38.688 --> 01:12:42.024
They're looking for you, Darren.
This is not the schoolyard.

01:12:42.108 --> 01:12:46.528
You either have to learn to fight or
to run. So which is it going to be?

01:12:57.457 --> 01:13:01.752
Good. But don't use your fist.
You have something better.

01:13:01.836 --> 01:13:05.255
Use your fingernails
like a dagger. Watch.

01:13:09.969 --> 01:13:13.889
Try it. Extend your fingers
and follow all the way through.

01:13:13.973 --> 01:13:15.849
Use all your strength.

01:13:21.731 --> 01:13:22.981
Ow!

01:13:23.775 --> 01:13:26.234
God, l think
l broke a nail.

01:13:26.319 --> 01:13:27.652
You broke a nail?

01:13:29.947 --> 01:13:32.866
You need blood. We have
a lot of work to do.

01:13:38.498 --> 01:13:39.915
Blood will have blood.

01:13:39.999 --> 01:13:41.374
Blood will have blood.

01:13:41.459 --> 01:13:44.920
Are you ready, you filthy
little pig, to be stuck?

01:13:45.004 --> 01:13:47.380
Do you renounce living
with the living?

01:13:48.049 --> 01:13:50.675
Are you prepared
to die with the dead?

01:14:17.912 --> 01:14:20.247
Steve, what the hell
are you doing?

01:14:20.331 --> 01:14:21.915
Well, hi,
Mr. Kersey.

01:14:22.542 --> 01:14:24.376
l just wanted to
stop by real quick

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:27.129
and actually apologize
for the way, you know,

01:14:27.213 --> 01:14:28.296
l've been acting
in school lately.

01:14:28.381 --> 01:14:30.590
lt's 3:00 a.m.

01:14:30.716 --> 01:14:33.718
My teachers troubled
me when l was a lad.

01:14:37.723 --> 01:14:42.227
They caned me and caned
me till l was bloody.

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:49.860
Then one day, l took up
a broken switch,

01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:53.655
and l rammed it in
my teacher's eyeball.

01:14:56.742 --> 01:14:58.285
Who are you?

01:14:58.369 --> 01:14:59.786
l'm his mentor.

01:15:06.419 --> 01:15:07.919
You see, Steve?

01:15:09.046 --> 01:15:10.046
Ow!

01:15:12.008 --> 01:15:14.926
This is what Crepsley
wants us to live with.

01:15:23.144 --> 01:15:27.439
So, Mr. Kersey,
what you got for me?

01:15:28.399 --> 01:15:30.859
So you really
don't kill people?

01:15:30.943 --> 01:15:31.985
No, Darren.

01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:36.865
You just sedate them and feed
a little bit, and then leave.

01:15:36.949 --> 01:15:39.034
l actually developed
the method.

01:15:39.118 --> 01:15:42.829
Well, two other vampires
and l, Gavner and Vincent.

01:15:43.748 --> 01:15:46.708
We were the freaks of the vampire
world. No one understood us.

01:15:46.792 --> 01:15:48.919
And then they
started to realize

01:15:49.003 --> 01:15:51.922
that if you don't kill your prey
every time like a little piggy,

01:15:52.006 --> 01:15:56.843
then you don't get hunted down by irate
townspeople with pitchforks and torches.

01:15:57.428 --> 01:16:02.140
And now half the vampires feed this
way, and the other half hate us.

01:16:04.977 --> 01:16:06.311
Quiet now.

01:16:15.488 --> 01:16:17.489
Whoa! How'd
you do that?

01:16:18.157 --> 01:16:21.451
Vampires can exhale a gas
that knocks out humans.

01:16:21.535 --> 01:16:22.577
Really?

01:16:22.662 --> 01:16:25.997
Drink some blood, you'll be
able to do all kinds of things.

01:16:26.082 --> 01:16:31.169
Now, we just make a small incision
in his shoulder. Right here.

01:16:33.839 --> 01:16:35.799
And then you
take a sip.

01:16:37.301 --> 01:16:40.762
Don't worry. He won't become a vampire
unless you exchange blood with him.

01:16:40.846 --> 01:16:45.350
Go ahead. l had some a couple of
days ago. lt's very refreshing.

01:16:45.434 --> 01:16:47.686
No, l'm not gonna
drink human blood.

01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:51.481
Hurry up, before someone sees
us. We haven't got all night.

01:16:52.525 --> 01:16:54.150
l'm not going to.

01:16:57.780 --> 01:17:02.117
You have to drink blood, Darren, or
you'll die. lt's as simple as that.

01:17:06.455 --> 01:17:09.040
Damn kid is gonna
get himself killed.

01:17:11.294 --> 01:17:14.129
Larten, what made
you blood him?

01:17:15.631 --> 01:17:18.091
l needed someone
to run errands for me.

01:17:18.175 --> 01:17:21.344
Oh, come on, you didn't
need to blood him for that.

01:17:21.429 --> 01:17:24.556
l had a feeling if l didn't,
something terrible would happen to him.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:29.436
Something terrible? As
opposed to becoming a vampire?

01:17:32.356 --> 01:17:34.482
l think you're
getting lonely.

01:17:34.567 --> 01:17:39.529
After 200 years of living alone, why
on earth would l suddenly become lonely?

01:17:39.613 --> 01:17:43.742
l don't know. Midlife
crisis? What is it?

01:17:45.036 --> 01:17:46.161
They're here.

01:18:44.595 --> 01:18:45.929
Watch out!

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:03.321
That's not fair.
Back!

01:19:03.406 --> 01:19:05.490
Darren,
get out of here!

01:19:06.117 --> 01:19:07.200
Duck!

01:19:12.873 --> 01:19:13.998
Move.

01:19:18.712 --> 01:19:19.921
Get in.

01:19:22.174 --> 01:19:23.133
Psst.

01:19:59.253 --> 01:20:01.921
Hey! Hey!

01:20:03.174 --> 01:20:05.967
Look, l don't even
like the Wolfman,

01:20:06.051 --> 01:20:09.679
but that don't mean you can come
in here and beat up on a freak!

01:20:09.763 --> 01:20:11.723
You're messing with the
wrong sideshow, baby!

01:20:11.807 --> 01:20:13.433
l'll bite your
damn noses off!

01:20:13.517 --> 01:20:15.935
l'm gonna ram
my head up your ass.

01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:17.103
Stop!

01:20:18.772 --> 01:20:19.898
Stop!

01:20:21.567 --> 01:20:23.735
There'll be
no fighting here.

01:20:25.404 --> 01:20:30.408
How dare you enter this campground?
The Vampire Council will hear of this.

01:20:34.497 --> 01:20:37.624
Tell the little vampire
it's time to come home.

01:20:38.417 --> 01:20:42.837
lt's almost dawn. l have a spare coffin
here. l suggest you get some rest as well.

01:20:42.922 --> 01:20:45.298
Aren't we gonna, like, double
back and attack them or something?

01:20:45.382 --> 01:20:46.674
Do you want
to stay alive?

01:20:46.759 --> 01:20:51.012
You're not even drinking blood yet.
l doubt you'd be much good in a fight.

01:20:51.096 --> 01:20:52.889
Well, what if they
hurt someone?

01:20:52.973 --> 01:20:55.391
People can look
out for themselves.

01:20:55.935 --> 01:20:58.269
You've been
looking out for me.

01:20:58.687 --> 01:21:00.396
Why?

01:21:00.481 --> 01:21:03.525
Why? Because l'm
an idiot, that's why.

01:21:04.401 --> 01:21:07.153
Only an idiot would spit
in the eye of Mr. Tiny.

01:21:07.238 --> 01:21:10.698
Because he doesn't just kill
people, he brings them back, as well.

01:21:10.783 --> 01:21:14.410
And when l finally die,
l plan on staying dead.

01:21:15.788 --> 01:21:20.291
Life may be meaningless, but
death l still have hope for.

01:21:21.418 --> 01:21:23.753
Life isn't
meaningless.

01:21:23.837 --> 01:21:28.007
Tell me that after 200 years
of it, kid. Good day.

01:21:38.352 --> 01:21:39.519
You know
l never liked him.

01:21:39.603 --> 01:21:40.728
l never did,
either.

01:21:40.813 --> 01:21:42.564
l told you
when l first saw him.

01:21:42.648 --> 01:21:44.357
Should never
have let him in.

01:21:44.441 --> 01:21:45.733
We all know
it's his fault.

01:21:45.818 --> 01:21:49.153
l just can't believe he has the
nerve to walk around in here.

01:21:49.238 --> 01:21:50.905
That poor Rebecca.

01:21:55.286 --> 01:21:58.871
They took her?
Where?

01:21:59.999 --> 01:22:05.044
l don't know, but they said
to tell you to come home.

01:22:07.047 --> 01:22:11.843
Which, of course, you're not gonna
do. Wait, Darren, Darren. No, buddy.

01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:13.177
Those guys are huge, man.

01:22:20.102 --> 01:22:22.437
Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Shan.
Hey, Annie.

01:22:22.521 --> 01:22:24.564
Steve. What are
you doing here?

01:22:25.190 --> 01:22:30.069
Well, you know, l've been thinking.
You guys probably really miss your son.

01:22:30.154 --> 01:22:34.657
And my mom is drunk half the time, so
she doesn't really notice l'm there.

01:22:35.534 --> 01:22:38.161
How about you
guys adopt me?

01:22:41.498 --> 01:22:42.874
No interest?

01:22:44.251 --> 01:22:46.669
Told you they
wouldn't go for it.

01:22:47.546 --> 01:22:48.546
Hmm.

01:22:49.089 --> 01:22:50.757
How disappointing.

01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:56.179
So few "people" have the
parenting instinct the way l do.

01:23:01.935 --> 01:23:03.686
Ready for the prom?

01:23:15.741 --> 01:23:19.494
Make new friends,
but keep the old

01:23:19.578 --> 01:23:22.955
One is silver
and the other's gold

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:27.293
Make new friends,
but keep the old

01:23:27.378 --> 01:23:30.713
One is silver
and the other's gold

01:24:22.975 --> 01:24:27.353
Hey, Octa. Say goodbye
to Crepsley for me, okay?

01:24:27.438 --> 01:24:29.731
Tell him l'm sorry
but l have to go home.

01:24:34.653 --> 01:24:36.988
lt's time, isn't it?

01:24:59.553 --> 01:25:03.347
Twenty-six.
Twenty-seven, 27.

01:25:03.432 --> 01:25:04.640
Twenty-seven.

01:25:04.850 --> 01:25:07.435
All right, no, no.
Twenty-eight.

01:25:07.519 --> 01:25:09.353
May l borrow
a couple of these?

01:25:11.732 --> 01:25:14.692
Don't forget to bring them
back, though. Both of them.

01:25:15.444 --> 01:25:18.404
You're in danger,
terrible danger.

01:25:18.489 --> 01:25:20.865
Your life and soul
are in jeopardy.

01:25:22.868 --> 01:25:23.868
What did l say?

01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:25.203
Nothing. Something
about the weather.

01:25:25.287 --> 01:25:28.831
Chance of thunderstorms tomorrow.
Don't worry. l'll stay indoors.

01:26:00.948 --> 01:26:03.616
Applause! Applause!

01:26:06.286 --> 01:26:09.413
Look. Little vampire.

01:26:11.333 --> 01:26:12.625
Take a bow.

01:26:12.876 --> 01:26:14.710
Where are my family
and my friends?

01:26:14.795 --> 01:26:15.837
Please.

01:26:15.921 --> 01:26:19.590
Must have patience.
Will spoil the show.

01:26:24.930 --> 01:26:27.932
Do you like? Does Murlaugh have talent?

01:26:29.017 --> 01:26:31.894
No? What do you
know about talent?

01:26:34.064 --> 01:26:39.861
Where is Crepsley?

01:26:42.322 --> 01:26:44.866
Too bad for Crapsley.

01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:48.536
Because he will
miss the show!

01:26:50.122 --> 01:26:54.959
Here is freak all
wrapped up tight.

01:26:57.421 --> 01:27:03.092
And here are beloved family
members. Applause. Applause.

01:27:05.679 --> 01:27:09.307
Hello, beloved son.
Hello, loving parents.

01:27:09.391 --> 01:27:14.103
Hello, cute little sister.
Four bags of blood.

01:27:15.606 --> 01:27:17.106
Don't worry.
You're all gonna be okay.

01:27:17.190 --> 01:27:19.567
Will be better than okay.

01:27:20.319 --> 01:27:23.821
Will be delicious!

01:27:25.365 --> 01:27:27.825
But now, may l present

01:27:27.951 --> 01:27:31.370
reunion with oldest friend
and blood brother,

01:27:31.455 --> 01:27:34.749
with he that shall
one day rule us all,

01:27:34.833 --> 01:27:39.462
the one known as Steve.

01:27:40.714 --> 01:27:42.840
Thank you!
Thank you!

01:27:44.509 --> 01:27:45.843
Steve.

01:27:46.428 --> 01:27:47.637
You're alive?

01:27:49.681 --> 01:27:52.683
You know, that was really an
asshole thing for you to do.

01:27:52.768 --> 01:27:56.062
Make your whole family and your
secret best friend go through all that?

01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:58.773
Look, l didn't mean
to hurt anybody, okay?

01:27:58.857 --> 01:28:00.650
Who cares what
you meant to do?

01:28:00.734 --> 01:28:03.861
What you did was take my
place. That was my dream.

01:28:05.614 --> 01:28:08.032
Steve, what are
you doing with him?

01:28:08.116 --> 01:28:10.117
Who? Murlaugh?

01:28:10.535 --> 01:28:12.870
Come on, man, he's
not as bad as he looks.

01:28:12.955 --> 01:28:15.998
You know, for one thing, he didn't
say l had bad blood like Crepsley.

01:28:16.083 --> 01:28:18.417
And for another thing,
he didn't lie to me.

01:28:18.502 --> 01:28:21.170
And you know what?
They think l'm awesome.

01:28:21.254 --> 01:28:25.549
They say l have a destiny,
or whatever. Look at you.

01:28:26.551 --> 01:28:30.096
Who wants to be a vampire
anyways? Vampires suck.

01:28:30.347 --> 01:28:31.931
Vampaneze rule!

01:28:32.057 --> 01:28:33.724
Juicy!

01:28:33.809 --> 01:28:36.560
First guy l killed,
Mr. Kersey.

01:28:36.645 --> 01:28:39.730
Blood just gets me going,
you know what l mean?

01:28:41.608 --> 01:28:43.776
l wouldn't know. l
haven't been drinking any.

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:49.865
l know you. Always trying to look
like Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes all the time.

01:28:50.617 --> 01:28:52.660
l bet you'll, like,
resist drinking blood

01:28:52.744 --> 01:28:54.495
and resist drinking
and resist drinking it,

01:28:54.579 --> 01:28:57.415
at the last second become
this total bloodhound!

01:28:59.626 --> 01:29:01.085
All right, man,
here's the deal.

01:29:01.169 --> 01:29:04.422
See, the fat guy, he still wants you on
the team, and despite everything else,

01:29:04.506 --> 01:29:07.425
you are still my best friend.
So l'll tell you what,

01:29:07.509 --> 01:29:10.636
l'll make you a deal that
might just save your ass.

01:29:10.721 --> 01:29:13.139
lf you kill your family,
l'll let the freak go.

01:29:15.058 --> 01:29:17.435
Wait. My bad,
that's backwards.

01:29:17.519 --> 01:29:20.021
lf you kill the freak,
l'll let your family live.

01:29:20.105 --> 01:29:22.606
What? Let the
juicy one go?

01:29:22.899 --> 01:29:26.402
Hey, look, man, it's part of
the plan. Talk to Mr. Tiny.

01:29:28.155 --> 01:29:29.905
So what do you say?

01:29:30.115 --> 01:29:33.367
Just kill her. Oh, yeah, you
got to drink her blood, too.

01:29:33.827 --> 01:29:35.953
You can do her in
with this.

01:30:02.981 --> 01:30:04.815
MR. TlNY: Wait!

01:30:06.985 --> 01:30:09.236
Allow him in,
gentlemen.

01:30:10.489 --> 01:30:12.490
l want to see
this play out.

01:30:13.658 --> 01:30:18.120
Man, that was pathetic. You're
totally weak. You need some blood.

01:30:21.208 --> 01:30:22.583
Murlaugh.

01:30:22.667 --> 01:30:23.793
Finally.

01:30:27.672 --> 01:30:29.757
And we thought you
weren't gonna show.

01:31:25.814 --> 01:31:27.857
l hate spiders!

01:31:47.252 --> 01:31:48.586
Darren. Come here.

01:31:50.714 --> 01:31:51.881
Okay.

01:31:55.802 --> 01:31:57.428
ls that your tail?

01:31:57.512 --> 01:31:58.804
Well, yeah.

01:31:59.055 --> 01:32:01.432
l'm really sorry l got you
involved in this, okay? l...

01:32:01.516 --> 01:32:04.935
Please stop staring.
So you really need blood?

01:32:05.896 --> 01:32:07.396
Yeah.
All right.

01:32:08.732 --> 01:32:11.901
Can you just take
a little? Go ahead.

01:32:12.736 --> 01:32:14.278
l'm offering it to you.

01:32:15.947 --> 01:32:19.700
Thanks. But l just
can't lose it.

01:32:19.784 --> 01:32:20.784
What?

01:32:21.203 --> 01:32:23.621
Whatever's still
making me human.

01:32:24.289 --> 01:32:29.501
Darren, being human's not about
what you are. lt's about who you are.

01:33:13.046 --> 01:33:14.129
No.

01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:03.762
He's all yours, lad.

01:34:24.242 --> 01:34:27.077
Good.
Right in the heart.

01:34:28.913 --> 01:34:31.915
So fair and foul a day
l have not seen.

01:34:35.587 --> 01:34:38.213
My people aren't
weak like yours.

01:34:39.257 --> 01:34:41.508
They will avenge me,
Crepsley.

01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:52.102
The truce, 100 years,
is over.

01:34:54.397 --> 01:34:56.398
The war begins.

01:35:05.617 --> 01:35:08.702
Marvelous. Magnificent.

01:35:08.787 --> 01:35:13.374
Really. Bravo. Bravo.

01:35:13.750 --> 01:35:18.045
lt's just like you said.
We started the war.

01:35:22.884 --> 01:35:27.012
lt won't start a war if
nobody hears about it.

01:35:32.644 --> 01:35:36.480
Young people today are
so difficult to control.

01:35:48.535 --> 01:35:49.535
l hate you.

01:35:49.619 --> 01:35:50.661
l hate you!

01:35:50.745 --> 01:35:52.663
l became a vampire
to save you, Steve.

01:35:52.747 --> 01:35:54.123
Thanks.

01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:10.973
Go ahead. Just do it!

01:36:25.029 --> 01:36:26.780
That's enough, boys.

01:36:31.703 --> 01:36:33.871
Steve, come with me.

01:36:34.622 --> 01:36:35.789
Not before
l kick his...

01:36:35.874 --> 01:36:37.875
You will behave!

01:36:39.377 --> 01:36:42.713
lt's not time for you to fight. Not yet.

01:36:44.215 --> 01:36:46.341
What does that mean?

01:36:46.426 --> 01:36:48.719
Oh, it's all written
down in a book.

01:36:49.637 --> 01:36:52.055
You do read books,
don't you?

01:36:59.105 --> 01:37:00.397
Steve.

01:37:03.902 --> 01:37:05.819
Look, don't...
Don't go.

01:37:07.530 --> 01:37:10.199
What else am
l supposed to do, man?

01:37:10.283 --> 01:37:11.950
Live with you
and a bunch of freaks?

01:37:13.661 --> 01:37:15.370
lt's too late now.

01:37:16.414 --> 01:37:18.582
l have my destiny,
and you have yours.

01:37:19.584 --> 01:37:23.921
How poignant. The parting
of two dear friends.

01:37:24.422 --> 01:37:26.507
Such sweet sorrow.

01:37:27.759 --> 01:37:31.887
Then again, you will
come home to us one day.

01:37:32.555 --> 01:37:35.057
My prodigal son.

01:37:35.141 --> 01:37:39.478
After all, you are
the bloodthirsty one.

01:37:40.438 --> 01:37:45.609
No. Just because l'm a vampire
doesn't mean l'm bloodthirsty.

01:37:47.403 --> 01:37:50.113
lt's not about what you are.
lt's about who you are.

01:37:58.957 --> 01:37:59.957
Oh.

01:38:00.291 --> 01:38:01.833
l almost forgot.

01:38:53.511 --> 01:38:55.220
Cover yourself.

01:38:57.515 --> 01:38:59.850
You have to teach me
how to do that someday.

01:38:59.934 --> 01:39:03.103
Oh, l'll teach you
everything, son.

01:39:03.187 --> 01:39:09.359
All my gibes and gambols. Now,
ready to go meet your people?

01:39:29.422 --> 01:39:30.797
Bye, Annie.

01:39:39.057 --> 01:39:41.224
Will it work?
Hypnotizing them?

01:39:42.393 --> 01:39:46.063
lt works on the memories, but
not on the emotions, not really.

01:39:47.231 --> 01:39:50.567
They'll always feel that
you're still alive, somehow.

01:39:50.943 --> 01:39:52.736
Well, that's good,
right?

01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:54.071
ls it?

01:40:05.416 --> 01:40:07.626
Hey, can l ask
you something?

01:40:11.089 --> 01:40:12.756
Can l kiss you?

01:40:13.925 --> 01:40:19.262
Darren, l let you drink my
blood. Sure, you can kiss me.

01:40:42.954 --> 01:40:46.289
Come on. We don't have all night.
l have an injured spider here.

01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:52.838
All right, how are we going to do
this? l can't carry the both of you.

01:40:54.006 --> 01:40:57.634
You carry Rebecca.
l can flit now.

01:40:57.719 --> 01:40:59.386
Just like a real vampire.

01:41:01.431 --> 01:41:04.307
Oh, Larten, you did it.

01:41:04.809 --> 01:41:07.060
You stuck your
neck out for him.

01:41:07.145 --> 01:41:10.439
You'd think a vampire would know
better than to stick his neck out.

01:41:11.983 --> 01:41:13.692
l am proud of you.

01:41:17.447 --> 01:41:19.656
All those who vote
for making Darren

01:41:19.741 --> 01:41:23.785
a member of the Cirque
raise your hands.

01:41:30.460 --> 01:41:31.918
One hand, Evra.

01:41:32.003 --> 01:41:33.211
Damn it.

01:41:35.757 --> 01:41:38.800
lt's done.
He will stay.

01:41:45.224 --> 01:41:46.850
So we get to stay.

01:41:48.603 --> 01:41:50.604
Not for long,
l'm afraid.

01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:52.731
You know, Crepsley,
it's okay.

01:41:55.651 --> 01:41:59.613
lt's weird. l spent so much time wishing
that none of this would have happened

01:41:59.697 --> 01:42:03.867
and that we never would have been
to the Cirque in the first place.

01:42:05.912 --> 01:42:09.873
But now l really can't imagine
my life happening any other way.

01:42:13.544 --> 01:42:15.045
Dawn's coming.

01:42:16.422 --> 01:42:20.091
l had something made for
you. lt's in your tent.

01:42:20.176 --> 01:42:21.885
A little gift.

01:42:23.554 --> 01:42:25.847
And it's Mr. Crepsley.

01:42:31.229 --> 01:42:34.731
Because you told me to
throw you. Well, l'm sorry.

01:42:36.275 --> 01:42:40.654
You did it, man. Once a
general, always a general.

01:42:41.072 --> 01:42:43.740
l couldn't have
done it better myself.

01:42:43.991 --> 01:42:45.700
At nightfall,
we leave with the boy.

01:42:48.496 --> 01:42:50.247
l suppose we
should tell him.

01:42:51.541 --> 01:42:54.793
No, let's give him one day
to rest. He's earned it.

01:42:57.755 --> 01:43:00.715
Sometimes life does
seem all planned out,

01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:02.551
like there's no choice
in the matter,

01:43:03.553 --> 01:43:04.678
but that's an illusion.

01:43:04.762 --> 01:43:06.513
Speakers. Tasty.

01:43:08.349 --> 01:43:10.016
My name's Darren Shan,

01:43:10.101 --> 01:48:59.824
and l don't just live with a
bunch of freaks. I am one, too.
