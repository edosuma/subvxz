Thank you.

01:58.732 --> 02:00.648
What a wonderful day
of rehearsal, gang.

02:00.648 --> 02:02.024
Thanks so much.
That was great.

02:02.024 --> 02:03.607
I like these men.

02:03.607 --> 02:05.566
- Really great job.
- Fantastic.

02:05.566 --> 02:07.566
- My best work.
- Wow.

02:07.566 --> 02:10.566
How about Susan Stroman?
I mean-- huh?

02:10.566 --> 02:11.607
She's the best.

02:11.607 --> 02:13.357
11:30 call
tomorrow.

02:13.357 --> 02:15.857
We're gonna start
with the new choreography
for "Fatwa Sex."

02:15.857 --> 02:18.898
- I gotta talk to Lin.
- All right.

02:18.898 --> 02:21.815
Quick question for you.
Cody wants to know which
poster you like more.

02:21.815 --> 02:25.399
- Um... I think this one.
- Cool.

02:25.399 --> 02:27.399
- Murray.
- Hey.

02:27.399 --> 02:29.773
- That was unbelievable!
- Oh, thanks.

02:29.773 --> 02:31.399
- So great.
- Felt good.

02:31.399 --> 02:33.357
- Loved it.
- Thanks.

02:33.357 --> 02:35.773
I got one little,
tiny note for you.

02:35.773 --> 02:38.149
- Yeah?
- It's a small, small note.

02:38.149 --> 02:41.857
I noticed that
you're denunciating
with your fist.

02:41.857 --> 02:46.399
And the ayatollah,
actually, he denunciates

02:46.399 --> 02:48.316
with his--
with his index finger.

02:48.316 --> 02:50.607
- He kind of uses it like a--
like a sledgehammer.
- Yeah?

02:50.607 --> 02:52.190
- That feels good.
- You like that?

02:52.190 --> 02:53.732
- I think it's terrific.
- Yeah.

02:53.732 --> 02:55.274
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

02:55.274 --> 02:57.357
Yeah. And...

02:57.357 --> 03:00.149
- I really like
your shoes.
- Really?

03:00.149 --> 03:02.190
- Yeah.
- Thank you!

03:02.190 --> 03:04.815
Lin: Can we go over
the choreo for "Fatwa Sex"
before we go onstage?

03:04.815 --> 03:06.524
Yeah, why don't you
come in at 10:45?

03:06.524 --> 03:08.357
We'll have
the dance captain come.

03:08.357 --> 03:09.773
- Ach!
- Are you happy?

03:09.773 --> 03:11.482
- Am I happy?
- Aren't they incredible?

03:11.482 --> 03:13.857
- It's crazy! This is insane!
- It's gonna be amazing.

03:13.857 --> 03:15.441
I can't believe
how excited I am!

03:15.441 --> 03:17.149
I've only been excited
twice in my life.

03:17.149 --> 03:19.024
- Unsnapping my first bra.
- ( laughs )

03:19.024 --> 03:20.815
And this!
This is like my second bra!

03:20.815 --> 03:22.274
Oh, well, fantastic.

03:22.274 --> 03:24.399
If this guy ever asks you
to go in the weeds,

03:24.399 --> 03:25.607
get in the weeds!

03:25.607 --> 03:27.524
- Is that fishing?
- No, no, no.

03:27.524 --> 03:30.316
- That's work.
That's work, yeah.
- Yeah. It's the work.

03:30.316 --> 03:32.107
- As I was watching it...
- Yeah?

03:32.107 --> 03:34.524
...I'm thinking
that old opening

03:34.524 --> 03:36.524
would work great now.

03:36.524 --> 03:38.232
- What?
- ♪ There's a fatwa,
there's a fatwa ♪

03:38.232 --> 03:39.399
♪ Gotta run,
I think I oughta-- ♪

03:39.399 --> 03:40.607
Oh, I totally
blocked that out.

03:40.607 --> 03:42.107
You know,
just sitting there,

03:42.107 --> 03:44.648
you can just feel
how well that could work.

03:44.648 --> 03:45.815
You know what we do?

03:45.815 --> 03:48.566
Cast album bonus track
just for the fans.

03:48.566 --> 03:51.399
Give them the bonus now.
Why have a bonus then?

03:51.399 --> 03:54.316
It's not a bonus
if it's already here.

03:54.316 --> 03:56.274
Cody, what'd
you think of that?

03:56.274 --> 03:58.441
My toe started tapping.
I mean--

03:58.441 --> 03:59.940
- Yeah.
- ♪ Gonna get shot-a. ♪

03:59.940 --> 04:02.190
- It's catchy.
- Yeah. It's catchy!

04:02.190 --> 04:03.316
But I think
this opening number

04:03.316 --> 04:05.357
sets up the thing
you love so much.

04:05.357 --> 04:06.815
Yeah. Yeah.
Okay.

04:06.815 --> 04:09.065
I gotta go to wardrobe
and get changed.
Walk with me?

04:09.065 --> 04:11.566
- Yeah. I wanna talk
to you about something.
- Great. Thanks, Cody.

04:11.566 --> 04:13.399
But honestly,
you should reconsider this.

04:13.399 --> 04:14.940
Look, watch.
Just watch this.

04:14.940 --> 04:17.065
One second.
I'm running, okay?
You're running.

04:17.065 --> 04:19.274
♪ There's a fatwa,
there's a fatwa, gotta run,

04:19.274 --> 04:20.982

♪ Gonna get scared,

04:22.857 --> 04:24.357
And everybody's yelling
from the windows.

04:24.357 --> 04:25.524
That's your
talk show bit.

04:25.524 --> 04:27.357
You do that
on "Late Night"
and say,

04:27.357 --> 04:30.065
"This is what turned into
the amazing musical number
we actually did."

04:30.065 --> 04:31.274
It's gonna be great.

04:31.274 --> 04:32.857
Hey, Cody, what'd
you think of that?

04:32.857 --> 04:35.399
I-- I would attend
a workshop of it.

04:35.399 --> 04:37.274
- It's a workshop.
- Larry: Hey.

04:37.274 --> 04:40.357
- So, first preview's
in a week.
- Yeah.

04:40.357 --> 04:42.357
I'm thinking
it would be a good idea

04:42.357 --> 04:44.024
to do something
for the cast and crew.

04:44.024 --> 04:46.607
Something fun, you know.
Maybe like paintball?

04:46.607 --> 04:47.982
Well,
that's a great idea!

04:47.982 --> 04:49.441
- Yeah?
- Yeah, absolutely.

04:49.441 --> 04:51.399
"Lion King"
used to do that
all the time.

04:51.399 --> 04:52.982
- Oh, terrific!
- Yeah, it might be fun.

04:52.982 --> 04:54.190
Great, we'll do it
this weekend.

04:54.190 --> 04:55.857
You know,
I'll pay for it.

04:55.857 --> 04:57.607
Great,
I'll spread the word
with the cast.

04:57.607 --> 04:59.399
- Hi, Greg.
- Hi.

04:59.399 --> 05:03.316
So, I think this is not
the tweed that we really want.

05:03.316 --> 05:05.773
- I just--
- What is it about it
that's not working for you?

05:05.773 --> 05:08.399
It's not quite
professorial enough.
Do you agree?

05:08.399 --> 05:10.566
- I-- I like it.
- You like it?

05:10.566 --> 05:12.940
- Yeah, I think it looks good.
- I'd like to see options, then.

05:12.940 --> 05:14.399
- Okay.
- Yeah.

05:14.399 --> 05:15.982
These are all the vests
I pulled.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.566
Oh, I wanted to ask you,

05:17.566 --> 05:19.940
my cousin Valentina
and her husband,

05:19.940 --> 05:21.399
their Airbnb fell through.

05:21.399 --> 05:23.441
They're coming in to see
the first preview.

05:23.441 --> 05:25.857
I was wondering
if they could maybe
stay with you.

05:25.857 --> 05:28.773
Hmm... no hotel?

05:28.773 --> 05:31.107
They're-- they're
a really interesting couple.

05:31.107 --> 05:33.024
Hotels are
not their thing.

05:33.024 --> 05:35.399
But aren't you
renting a house?

05:35.399 --> 05:36.815
Yeah, but me and V
only have one bedroom.

05:36.815 --> 05:38.024
There's really not room,

05:38.024 --> 05:39.441
and you've got
that great big house.

05:39.441 --> 05:41.316
Is that okay?
Is that-- it's cool?

05:42.607 --> 05:44.232
Yeah, sure.
What the hell.

05:44.232 --> 05:45.773
All right.
Thank you.

05:45.773 --> 05:47.940
Wonder if there's
anything else

05:47.940 --> 05:50.107
we need to do
before tomorrow.

05:50.107 --> 05:52.316
- Something wrong?
- ( laughs ) I--

05:52.316 --> 05:54.524
I just did you
a very nice favor.

05:54.524 --> 05:55.940
- Yeah.
- Uh...

05:55.940 --> 05:58.441
and that "thank you" was--

05:58.441 --> 06:00.190
it was like I passed you
the ketchup.

06:00.190 --> 06:02.898
- Yeah, no, no.
- It was not commensurate
with the gesture.

06:02.898 --> 06:05.149
Oh, I--
I appreciate it.

06:05.149 --> 06:06.566
Thank you.

06:06.566 --> 06:08.482
Um, what else
do you have?

06:08.482 --> 06:10.399
Greg:
You've seen
the choices.

06:10.399 --> 06:12.316
- Um...
- All right, I'm-- I'm--

06:12.316 --> 06:14.149
- I'm gonna head back.
I'll see you later.
- Okay. Thanks.

06:14.149 --> 06:16.524
- Thanks again.
- Yeah.

06:16.524 --> 06:19.316
- Greg: What do we think?
- Lin: Yeah, it's a little boxy.

06:19.316 --> 06:22.149
Susie:
Where's Funkhouser?
Where is he?

06:22.149 --> 06:24.441
- He's always late, this guy.
- I know. So rude.

06:24.441 --> 06:27.815
I say next time, we tell him
a half hour earlier.

06:27.815 --> 06:29.566
- You know what,
let's just sit down.
- Susie: All right.

06:29.566 --> 06:31.107
We'll have some appetizers,
maybe even order dinner.

06:31.107 --> 06:33.857
- Who cares? Yeah.
- Who cares?

06:33.857 --> 06:35.399
- Hi. Um...
- Hi.

06:35.399 --> 06:37.482
David.
Reservation.

06:37.482 --> 06:39.690
Ah! Yes.
Party of four.

06:39.690 --> 06:41.274
Are you all here?

06:41.274 --> 06:42.441
No, we have three.

06:42.441 --> 06:44.024
Well, I'm sorry.

06:44.024 --> 06:46.524
We can't seat you until
your entire party arrives.

06:46.524 --> 06:48.732
- Why?
- It's our policy.

06:48.732 --> 06:50.399
We don't seat
incomplete parties.

06:50.399 --> 06:52.399
What's the point of the policy?
We have three people.

06:52.399 --> 06:54.441
It's the same table.
What's the difference?

06:54.441 --> 06:57.065
The chef really likes
everyone to sit together

06:57.065 --> 06:59.690
so they can order together
and he can deliver the food
at the same time.

06:59.690 --> 07:01.732
- Oh, the chef likes
everyone to sit together.
- Yes.

07:01.732 --> 07:05.190
- Isn't that nice?
- It makes for the optimal
dining experience.

07:05.190 --> 07:07.399
Okay, you know
what the optimal
dining experience is?

07:07.399 --> 07:09.399
To eat when
you're hungry, okay?

07:09.399 --> 07:11.815
- I understand.
- That's the optimal
dining experience.

07:11.815 --> 07:13.274
I'm sorry.
That's our policy.

07:13.274 --> 07:14.857
We do not sit
incomplete parties.

07:14.857 --> 07:17.232
- Yeah.
- No, this is bullshit.

07:17.232 --> 07:19.732
- I know.
- Guess we'll wait.

07:19.732 --> 07:22.190
Hey, I got
that paintball
thing secured.

07:22.190 --> 07:23.566
Oh, good for you.
That'll be fun.

07:23.566 --> 07:25.482
- They're gonna love it.
- What? What is it?

07:25.482 --> 07:28.441
I'm taking the cast and crew
to do, like, a paintball day.

07:28.441 --> 07:30.566
- You know paintball?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fun.

07:30.566 --> 07:32.732
- They shoot paint
instead of bullets.
- It's a good bonding.

07:32.732 --> 07:34.773
Yeah, we're gonna
do it on Saturday.

07:34.773 --> 07:37.274
- Sat-- wait.
This Saturday?
- Yeah.

07:37.274 --> 07:39.982
It's Sammi's wedding
this Saturday.

07:39.982 --> 07:41.399
I thought it was
the week after.

07:41.399 --> 07:44.232
Oh, God, I sent you
the save-the-date,

07:44.232 --> 07:45.940
I sent you
the invitation,

07:45.940 --> 07:47.732
you never fucking
wrote it down?!

07:47.732 --> 07:50.732
- You sent me too many things!
- Don't make it my fault now!

07:50.732 --> 07:53.065
You know what,
I'll work it out.
I can do both.

07:53.065 --> 07:55.065
You're making a speech.
You promised Sammi.

07:55.065 --> 07:57.441
All right,
I'll work it out.
I'll work it out.

07:57.441 --> 07:59.024
I'm sorry.
I'm just a little cranky--

07:59.024 --> 08:00.648
- I'm hungry.
- Larry: Me, too.

08:00.648 --> 08:02.232
No, but I'm hungry.

08:02.232 --> 08:05.107
- Yeah, I hear you.
- Jeff: Yeah. Shall we leave?

08:05.107 --> 08:07.274
Susie:
We don't have a reservation.
You can't get in anywhere.

08:07.274 --> 08:09.566
It's crazy.
You know how I get.

08:09.566 --> 08:12.940
- The blood sugar,
up and down, up and down.
- Jeff: I know how you get.

08:12.940 --> 08:16.024
Okay, I'm gonna
take care of this.

08:16.024 --> 08:17.982
- Stay right here.
- All right.

08:17.982 --> 08:20.815
- Susie: The food here is great
and you know it.
- Jeff: I do.

08:20.815 --> 08:22.607
- Hello.
- Hello.

08:22.607 --> 08:24.607
Are you alone
by any chance?

08:24.607 --> 08:26.940
- Perhaps.
- Please do not
misconstrue this.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.898
This is not a pickup
in any way, shape, or form.

08:29.898 --> 08:32.274
- Okay.
- I don't pick up;
I put down.

08:32.274 --> 08:36.107
- ( laughs ) Okay.
- Now, the situation is thus:

08:36.107 --> 08:38.482
this restaurant
has an idiotic policy...

08:40.024 --> 08:41.316
Larry:
Okay, let's go.

08:42.524 --> 08:43.648
We have four.

08:43.648 --> 08:46.274
- Four?
- Yes, four.

08:46.274 --> 08:47.566
Okay.

08:47.566 --> 08:49.648
Table six, please.

08:56.024 --> 08:59.441
- Thanks for joining.
- Of course. I'm hap--
happy to be here.

08:59.441 --> 09:02.773
- So what do you do?
- I'm an actress.

09:02.773 --> 09:04.648
- Oh.
- You know,
I just figured at 36,

09:04.648 --> 09:06.441
if there's any profession
that you can do

09:06.441 --> 09:09.149
later in life as a woman,
it's acting.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.815
Have we seen you
in anything?

09:10.815 --> 09:13.773
No, but I'm doing
some plus-size modeling.

09:13.773 --> 09:15.982
- Really?
- And then I do
stand-in work.

09:15.982 --> 09:17.690
Okay, she stands in
for the star.

09:17.690 --> 09:19.190
- For the camera.
- For the camera.

09:19.190 --> 09:20.732
Right, yeah,
I understand.

09:20.732 --> 09:22.107
I'm sorry.

09:22.107 --> 09:23.898
You were the guy
with the, uh--

09:23.898 --> 09:25.357
you have the fatwa
on you, right?

09:25.357 --> 09:27.024
Yeah, that's-a-me.

09:27.024 --> 09:29.482
What are you doing out?
Aren't you kind of scared?

09:29.482 --> 09:31.024
They called it off.

09:31.024 --> 09:33.149
- So it's over.
- Yeah, but I was out anyway.

09:33.149 --> 09:35.690
- Jeff: Yeah.
- Yeah, he did.
He was brave.

09:35.690 --> 09:37.441
Can I give you
a business card?

09:37.441 --> 09:40.065
Sorry, 'cause
I'm just realizing now
you're that writer.

09:40.065 --> 09:42.399
- Yeah.
- I've never done comedy,
but it doesn't seem that hard.

09:42.399 --> 09:44.190
- Hmm.
- Here you go.

09:44.190 --> 09:47.232
- Ah. Marie Deschamps?
- Susie: Mmm.

09:47.232 --> 09:50.232
- What are you, French?
- No, it's actually
my stage name.

09:50.232 --> 09:51.982
Johnson's
my real last name.

09:51.982 --> 09:54.566
- Jeff: Is Marie
your real first name?
- No. Jenny.

09:54.566 --> 09:57.566
All right, well,
I'll put your card
in my pocket.

09:57.566 --> 09:59.982
I will never call you,
but I'll put it
in my pocket.

09:59.982 --> 10:02.857
And I'm very glad that
that fatwa got cleared up.

10:02.857 --> 10:04.773
- Larry: Thank you.
- Does it ever occur to you

10:04.773 --> 10:08.857
that maybe this fatwa thing
is not as over as you think?

10:08.857 --> 10:10.357
You know how
the Japanese soldiers,

10:10.357 --> 10:12.107
they'd find them
on, like, an island,

10:12.107 --> 10:14.773
and they wouldn't know
the war's been over
for a long time?

10:14.773 --> 10:16.566
Maybe someone
is so off the grid

10:16.566 --> 10:18.898
that they have no idea
the fatwa's over.

10:18.898 --> 10:20.482
Maybe someone
is so stupid

10:20.482 --> 10:23.149
that they say things
they shouldn't be saying.

10:23.149 --> 10:25.274
- Maybe.
- Marty: Hello!

10:25.274 --> 10:27.441
- Hey, look who's here.
- Hello. Marie.

10:27.441 --> 10:29.482
Oh, is this
a replacement
for Bridget?

10:29.482 --> 10:31.024
I recruited her
from the bar.

10:31.024 --> 10:32.607
- She's a stand-in for you.
- Oh, great.

10:32.607 --> 10:34.690
We gotta get you a chair.
Where's the waiter?

10:34.690 --> 10:36.232
Larry:
Yeah. You know what?

10:36.232 --> 10:37.690
You need to go now.

10:37.690 --> 10:39.149
- What?
- Larry: Yeah.

10:39.149 --> 10:41.566
You stood in.
Now it's time to stand up.

10:41.566 --> 10:45.482
But, hey, very good job.
Good stand-in job.

10:45.482 --> 10:47.482
- Really?
- But first team
has arrived, so...

10:47.482 --> 10:49.898
And listen, Larry,
if you ever need an actor,

10:49.898 --> 10:51.482
you call me, okay?

10:51.482 --> 10:52.732
You never know.

10:52.732 --> 10:53.940
Okay, I'm expecting
the call.

10:53.940 --> 10:55.940
Okay-- well,
I wouldn't go that far.

10:55.940 --> 10:58.648
- Susie:
Well, hello there.
- That was interesting.

10:58.648 --> 11:00.274
- ( Susie chuckles ) Yeah.
- Hi.

11:00.274 --> 11:03.607
You know, it's customary
when someone is 20 minutes late

11:03.607 --> 11:06.274
to offer an apology
to their friends.

11:06.274 --> 11:08.190
- Am I right?
- That's absolutely correct.

11:08.190 --> 11:10.149
- Larry: That's accurate?
- Susie: Yes.

11:10.149 --> 11:11.482
Sorry.

11:11.482 --> 11:14.107
( scoffs )
What? That's a "sorry"?

11:14.107 --> 11:15.940
Don't insult us with that.

11:15.940 --> 11:17.482
If you're more
than ten minutes late,

11:17.482 --> 11:19.316
it's gotta be
a profuse apology.

11:19.316 --> 11:21.648
That was an apology
like you were one minute late.

11:21.648 --> 11:23.357
- Am I right?
- He's right.

11:23.357 --> 11:26.399
And frankly, your "sorry"
was not commensurate
with the offense.

11:26.399 --> 11:27.940
Can I get a drink?

11:27.940 --> 11:29.940
If I was 20 minutes late,

11:29.940 --> 11:34.065
I'd be apologizing
like I accidentally
killed your family.

11:34.065 --> 11:35.732
- Guess what.
- Yeah?

11:35.732 --> 11:38.024
You did accidentally
kill my family.

11:38.024 --> 11:40.648
My nephew,
the joy of my life,

11:40.648 --> 11:44.024
was killed by the bulls,
and it was your fault!

11:44.024 --> 11:45.441
Okay?!

11:47.773 --> 11:49.773
Sorry.

11:52.190 --> 11:53.815
Bottle of wine, anybody?

11:53.815 --> 11:55.648
- Both: Yes! Good idea.
- Yeah.

11:55.648 --> 11:56.982
- Susie: Red or white?
- Love red.

11:56.982 --> 11:58.149
So what's happening?

11:58.149 --> 12:01.149
I had a colonoscopy.
Clean as a whistle.

12:15.149 --> 12:16.648
- Hey!
- Hey, good morning, Larry.

12:16.648 --> 12:18.857
Good morning.

12:18.857 --> 12:20.732
Hey, L.D.
Thanks for paintball.

12:20.732 --> 12:23.357
Oh, y-you're very welcome.
You're very welcome.

12:23.357 --> 12:25.065
Hey, that was
so sweet of you.

12:25.065 --> 12:26.690
- Oh. It was nothing.
- Thank you. Really.

12:26.690 --> 12:27.940
- Nothing.
- It's gonna be fun.

12:27.940 --> 12:29.773
- See you inside.
- Okay.

12:29.773 --> 12:31.190
You know what,
get me the salmon--

12:31.190 --> 12:33.482
- get me the salmon
with the salad.
- Cool.

12:33.482 --> 12:34.898
Thanks for
the paintball, L.D.

12:34.898 --> 12:36.690
You are very,
very welcome.

12:36.690 --> 12:39.399
Speaking
of the paintball,
that is so nice.

12:39.399 --> 12:40.982
The crew
is freaking out.

12:40.982 --> 12:42.982
Oh, I'm happy
to do it.

12:42.982 --> 12:45.857
I love paintball
and I am sorry I can't go.

12:45.857 --> 12:47.149
I have a gig booked.

12:47.149 --> 12:48.274
Shooting a commercial

12:48.274 --> 12:51.232
for this feline
distemper medication.

12:51.232 --> 12:53.940
I have my shots,
so I know how to deal
with the cats.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.732
Mm, ah.
What a shame.

12:55.732 --> 12:57.898
How do you have
an event like this
without Cody Gutcher?

12:57.898 --> 13:00.232
- I know.
- Huh?

13:00.232 --> 13:02.773
- ( sighs )
- What are they paying you
for this thing, may I ask?

13:02.773 --> 13:05.898
It's my day rate.
1,200.

13:05.898 --> 13:08.065
Okay, you know what?

13:08.065 --> 13:10.149
I'm gonna take care
of that for you.

13:10.149 --> 13:11.732
I'll give you the 1,200.

13:11.732 --> 13:14.024
Tell them you can't make it.
You're going to paintball.

13:14.024 --> 13:16.482
- ( laughs )
Oh, my God, Larry!
- Huh?

13:16.482 --> 13:19.024
- Thank you!
- We couldn't do it
without you, Cody Gutcher.

13:19.024 --> 13:21.690
- You gotta be there.
- Thank you so much.
You are a prince.

13:21.690 --> 13:24.107
You're welcome,
and let me just say this--

13:24.107 --> 13:25.690
that is a fantastic
"thank you."

13:25.690 --> 13:28.441
That was a "thank you"
commensurate with the gesture.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.107
And it's worth it
for that "thank you."

13:30.107 --> 13:32.274
- What do you think about that?
- We're gonna have a blast.

13:32.274 --> 13:34.065
I love that "thank you."
Love it.

13:34.065 --> 13:35.274
My pleasure.

13:35.274 --> 13:37.607
Cody: Jeremy?
( laughing )

13:37.607 --> 13:39.232
- Larry: Hey, Murray.
- Ah, Larry.

13:39.232 --> 13:42.316
Oh, listen,
about the, uh--
the harem scene.

13:42.316 --> 13:43.648
There's too many redheads.

13:43.648 --> 13:45.274
- Six?
- Yeah.

13:45.274 --> 13:46.940
What do you think?
Four?

13:46.940 --> 13:48.441
Yeah, you're right.

13:48.441 --> 13:49.607
I think four.
Four is better.

13:49.607 --> 13:51.648
Thanks, thanks.

13:51.648 --> 13:53.773
Oh, same pants
as yesterday.

13:55.982 --> 13:57.607
What, are you
tracking my outfits?

13:57.607 --> 14:00.107
No, no, just...
observing, that's all.

14:00.107 --> 14:03.357
You know, I was late
and they had the belt
in them from yesterday,

14:03.357 --> 14:05.024
so I picked them up
'cause I was in a hurry.

14:05.024 --> 14:06.898
They're not dirty
or anything.

14:06.898 --> 14:08.815
Then by all means,
wear them again.

14:08.815 --> 14:10.773
You're an outfit tracker,
Murray.

14:10.773 --> 14:12.274
Nobody likes
an outfit tracker.

14:12.274 --> 14:14.441
I don't know why
a casual observation

14:14.441 --> 14:16.482
has made you
so uncomfortable.

14:16.482 --> 14:18.732
I just feel like
I'm living in some kind
of clothing police state,

14:18.732 --> 14:20.107
like it's 1984.

14:20.107 --> 14:21.482
Big Murray's watching me.

14:21.482 --> 14:22.898
Big Murray's
not watching you.

14:22.898 --> 14:24.316
No, Big Murray
is  watching.

14:24.316 --> 14:26.190
Big Murray has
other things to do.

14:26.190 --> 14:29.024
Apparently, Big Murray
has nothing else to do
but outfit track.

14:29.024 --> 14:30.441
I'm not judging you,

14:30.441 --> 14:32.940
I'm just noticing
that you wore the same pants.

14:32.940 --> 14:35.107
Okay, Big Murray.

14:42.190 --> 14:45.482
- Robes, robes, robes...
- Hey, L.D., psyched about
the paintball.

14:45.482 --> 14:47.982
- Thank you so much.
- Oh, my pleasure!
Of course!

14:47.982 --> 14:49.898
You are the kindest.
Thank you so much.

14:49.898 --> 14:51.316
Oh, you're so welcome!

14:52.524 --> 14:54.316
- Hey.
- What's up?

14:54.316 --> 14:57.316
I have great news.
We got a signer.

14:57.316 --> 14:58.982
For-- for deaf people?

14:58.982 --> 15:00.399
Yeah, yeah,
for deaf people.

15:00.399 --> 15:01.815
And anyone who enjoys ASL.

15:01.815 --> 15:03.857
I mean, she's basically
on the side

15:03.857 --> 15:06.024
and she signs
throughout the performance.

15:06.024 --> 15:08.482
- It's awesome.
- Do deaf people
go to musicals?

15:08.482 --> 15:10.898
- Yeah.
- Why don't we just have

15:10.898 --> 15:13.607
one performance a month
for all deaf people?

15:13.607 --> 15:17.024
And we don't
have to be distracted
by a signer onstage.

15:17.024 --> 15:19.316
You want to segregate
the deaf?

15:19.316 --> 15:20.982
No, I don't want
to segregate them.

15:20.982 --> 15:22.732
Yeah, separate,
but equal.

15:22.732 --> 15:24.940
Special, but equal.

15:24.940 --> 15:27.024
She's gonna be incredible.
You'll see.

15:27.024 --> 15:29.357
It's really inclusive.
Hey, let me ask you something.

15:29.357 --> 15:30.524
Do you like this robe?

15:30.524 --> 15:32.690
I-- yeah, it's nice.
I like it.

15:32.690 --> 15:34.732
That's what I thought.
We need to see more robes.

15:34.732 --> 15:36.524
You're gonna have
to go shopping again.

15:38.190 --> 15:39.232
Thank you.

15:40.857 --> 15:43.524
Okay, you're driving
this poor guy nuts, okay?

15:43.524 --> 15:45.648
- That's the gig.
- He's gonna quit.

15:45.648 --> 15:47.607
No, he's gonna get
in the weeds with us.

15:47.607 --> 15:49.232
He's gonna emerge
with the perfect robe.

15:49.232 --> 15:50.648
Okay, well,
I'm telling you,

15:50.648 --> 15:52.566
he's one foot
out the door right now.

15:52.566 --> 15:55.190
Well, as long as he's
one foot out the door
finding the right robe,

15:55.190 --> 15:56.815
I don't give a fuck.

15:56.815 --> 15:58.690
- Woman: Hi!
- Hi!

15:58.690 --> 16:01.024
- Lin! Hi!
- Oh, my God,
you made it!

16:01.024 --> 16:04.441
- So good to see you.
- Hi, Ernst. Great to see you.
How are you?

16:04.441 --> 16:07.107
Larry, this is my cousin
Valentina and her husband Ernst.

16:07.107 --> 16:08.065
Hey,
nice to meet you.

16:08.065 --> 16:10.399
- Valentina? Hi.
- Hi. Yeah.

16:10.399 --> 16:12.024
- Hello.
- Hello. Hi.

16:12.024 --> 16:13.898
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you as well.

16:13.898 --> 16:16.898
So, is this the wardrobe area?
Tell me about this place.

16:16.898 --> 16:19.566
Yes, this is the wardrobe area.
This is where all the costumes
in the show are.

16:19.566 --> 16:21.190
And we're just getting
everything, uh--

16:21.190 --> 16:24.274
I'm Gregory Michael David.
I'm the costume designer.

16:24.274 --> 16:26.524
- Hi. Valentina.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

16:26.524 --> 16:28.773
- This is your fiefdom.
- Yes, yes!

16:28.773 --> 16:31.648
This is the workshop,
so, yeah, feel free
to look around.

16:31.648 --> 16:34.732
Yeah, just seems like fun
to have people try on
your creations.

16:34.732 --> 16:37.857
Greg: Yes. If you
wanna try anything on,
please let me know.

16:37.857 --> 16:39.566
Yes.
Do you have things
in turquoise?

16:39.566 --> 16:41.857
- I could pull
some stuff for you, yeah.
- I would love that.

16:41.857 --> 16:43.815
He seems
very competent.

16:43.815 --> 16:46.274
Yeah. We're a robe away,
but he's doing great.

16:46.274 --> 16:47.982
I get it.

16:47.982 --> 16:49.441
How long you two
been married?

16:50.773 --> 16:52.815
- Um... a few years.
- Yeah.

16:52.815 --> 16:54.274
Kids?

16:54.274 --> 16:55.773
- Mmm, no.
- No.

16:55.773 --> 16:58.732
- We're not
gonna have kids.
- No. Cats.

16:58.732 --> 17:00.815
- Why don't you guys
go upstairs...
- Okay.

17:00.815 --> 17:03.024
...and I'll give
you guys a tour as soon
as I get upstairs.

17:03.024 --> 17:04.773
They've got the directions
to your place.

17:04.773 --> 17:08.274
Yeah, yeah,
just go over anytime,
make yourself at home,

17:08.274 --> 17:10.441
and stay as long
as you like, actually.

17:11.566 --> 17:13.190
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

17:16.690 --> 17:20.482
All right.
I see where you got
your tepid "thank yous" from.

17:20.482 --> 17:22.441
That was worse
than your "thank you."

17:22.441 --> 17:25.065
That seemed like
a perfectly appropriate
"thank you" to me.

17:25.065 --> 17:26.357
- Oh, did it? Really?
- Yeah.

17:26.357 --> 17:27.982
What is it
with you Mirandas?

17:27.982 --> 17:29.940
You're missing
some kind of...

17:29.940 --> 17:31.316
"thank you" gene
or something.

17:31.316 --> 17:34.232
( laughs )
I think we all said it.

17:34.232 --> 17:36.065
Yeah. Okay.

17:36.065 --> 17:37.648
- Okay, I'll see you upstairs.
- See you upstairs.

17:37.648 --> 17:41.524
Yeah.
Let's find a Dumpster
for this bullshit.

17:41.524 --> 17:44.482
Hey, those are from
a rental house, Lin.

17:46.357 --> 17:50.024
Cody: Okay, everybody,
we're at places, please,
for "Salman, Get Out."

17:50.024 --> 17:52.482
Full tech and music.

17:52.482 --> 17:54.607
- Is our signer here?
- Yes, right here.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.065
Come on up here, please.

17:58.274 --> 17:59.690
We have a place for you.

17:59.690 --> 18:02.648
That spike mark,
downstage left.

18:02.648 --> 18:05.566
Man:
Places for the top!

18:05.566 --> 18:07.399
- ( Cody whispers ) All right.
- ( clears throat )

18:07.399 --> 18:10.190
- Man: Good morning!
- Woman: Hello, darling.

18:10.190 --> 18:13.690
And breakfast
for our guest.

18:13.690 --> 18:15.316
No granola?

18:15.316 --> 18:17.149
Ah, no. I...

18:19.190 --> 18:20.898
( whispers )
You should be grateful.

18:20.898 --> 18:22.898
Hey, uh, Salman, hey,
you should be grateful.

18:22.898 --> 18:25.024
Lin: I'm grateful.
I'm just a little tired
of muesli.

18:25.024 --> 18:28.482
- You can be grateful
and tired of muesli.
- ( whispers ) Hey.

18:28.482 --> 18:31.566
- Salman, we have to talk.
- What do you want
to talk about?

18:31.566 --> 18:33.399
- We took you into our home.
- ( music begins )

18:33.399 --> 18:35.898
You wouldn't have
made it on your own.

18:35.898 --> 18:37.857
But now it's time
for you to go.

18:37.857 --> 18:40.566
I have to say
I'm a little thrown.

18:40.566 --> 18:41.773
( music continues )

18:41.773 --> 18:43.607
- You're a slob.
- You're a pig.

18:43.607 --> 18:47.232
- You're a lazy lout.
- So what are you saying?

18:47.232 --> 18:49.441
Both:
♪ Salman, get out! ♪

18:49.441 --> 18:52.024
♪ I'm a great guest,
you hardly know I'm there ♪

18:52.024 --> 18:55.190
Woman:
♪ You walk around in a robe
with no underwear ♪

18:55.190 --> 18:57.898
Lin:
♪ If you make me leave,
I'll be dead, no doubt ♪

18:57.898 --> 18:59.441
Man:
♪ Ugh! Close your legs ♪

18:59.441 --> 19:01.607
All:
♪ And, Salman, get out ♪

19:01.607 --> 19:03.566
( music continues )

19:07.690 --> 19:09.065
Woman:
And stay out!

19:09.065 --> 19:11.107
- Don't come back!
- Lose my number!

19:11.107 --> 19:12.690
Go stay with
the ayatollah!

19:12.690 --> 19:14.316
All:
♪ Salman, Salman ♪

19:14.316 --> 19:18.773
♪ Salman, Salman, Salman,
Salman, Salman ♪

19:18.773 --> 19:20.107
♪ Salman, get out! ♪

19:20.107 --> 19:22.107
- ( music ends )
- ( applause )

19:22.107 --> 19:24.024
Cody:
Okay, great!
( clears throat )

19:24.024 --> 19:25.815
Great work, everybody.

19:25.815 --> 19:27.607
It was good.
Too bad you missed it.

19:27.607 --> 19:29.524
- Oh, no, I-- I saw it.
- Yeah.

19:29.524 --> 19:30.566
Lin:
Thank you, Cody.

19:30.566 --> 19:32.107
- Thank you.
- Thanks, guys.

19:32.107 --> 19:33.773
- Tina, you're a star.
Thank you.
- Thank you.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.441
Hey, Larry, can I talk
to you for a sec?

19:36.773 --> 19:38.898
( whispers )
I feel like--

19:38.898 --> 19:40.940
I feel like
the number's not working.

19:40.940 --> 19:43.274
- Oh. You know why
it's not working?
- Why?

19:43.274 --> 19:45.107
'Cause everybody's
looking at her tits,
that's why.

19:45.107 --> 19:48.107
- What?
- Bill didn't see
ten seconds of that number.

19:48.107 --> 19:49.566
He was staring at her
the whole time,

19:49.566 --> 19:51.316
as was every other guy
in the audience.

19:51.316 --> 19:53.690
It's just the reasons
he's getting kicked out
of the house

19:53.690 --> 19:54.815
are so fuckin' petty.

19:54.815 --> 19:56.566
No, I completely
disagree with you.

19:56.566 --> 19:58.149
Look,
he's a terrible houseguest.

19:58.149 --> 20:00.815
His life depends
on his being a good houseguest.

20:00.815 --> 20:02.773
He's a pig!
He doesn't do the dishes!

20:02.773 --> 20:03.857
That's funny!

20:03.857 --> 20:05.441
Maybe we just need
different reasons.

20:05.441 --> 20:07.316
Okay, I'll come up
with some other reasons.

20:07.316 --> 20:08.773
- How's that?
- Okay.

20:08.773 --> 20:11.107
- It's not gonna work anyway.
- Why not?

20:11.107 --> 20:13.566
Because men
will look at tits
over anything.

20:13.566 --> 20:16.357
You could be
in the last inning
of the World Series,

20:16.357 --> 20:18.107
a 3-2 score,
bases loaded,

20:18.107 --> 20:19.815
somebody changes the channel
and there's tits on,

20:19.815 --> 20:21.524
they will not go back
to the World Series.

20:21.524 --> 20:23.940
We're on the verge
of making a great musical,

20:23.940 --> 20:25.566
and you're
scapegoating tits?

20:25.566 --> 20:28.024
- It's the scene.
- No, it's the tits!

20:28.024 --> 20:29.732
- It's the scene.
- Tits!

20:29.732 --> 20:32.190
- Scene! Scene! Scene!
- Tits! Tits! Tits!

20:32.190 --> 20:33.982
Scene,
and she stays.

20:35.690 --> 20:37.357
Sorry.

20:37.357 --> 20:39.607
All right,
insufficient "sorry."

20:39.607 --> 20:42.607
Terrible, awful,
horrible "sorry."

20:42.607 --> 20:44.357
Apparently,
the Miranda "sorrys"

20:44.357 --> 20:46.898
are just as bad
as their "thank yous."

20:48.190 --> 20:50.149
Larry:
You heard me-- 1,200.

20:50.149 --> 20:53.524
1,200 fuckin' dollars
to skip a day on his real job

20:53.524 --> 20:55.190
to come with you guys
paintballing?

20:55.190 --> 20:57.149
- You're a good guy.
- Thank you.

20:57.149 --> 20:59.232
- I respect you for that.
- People don't think
I'm a nice guy.

20:59.232 --> 21:00.732
Basically, you're paying
this motherfucker

21:00.732 --> 21:03.024
to shoot people
with a goddamn paint gun.

21:03.024 --> 21:04.149
See?

21:05.482 --> 21:06.732
You know what
I just realized?

21:06.732 --> 21:10.149
- Mm-hmm?
- I gave this guy 1,200,

21:10.149 --> 21:12.566
but he wasn't gonna
make 1,200.

21:12.566 --> 21:14.149
- That's his gross.
- Mmm!

21:14.149 --> 21:16.399
They're gonna deduct taxes
from what he's getting.

21:16.399 --> 21:19.524
He'd only wind up
with 700 or 750.

21:19.524 --> 21:21.898
The guy just made
$500 off me.

21:21.898 --> 21:23.482
You  fucked up.

21:23.482 --> 21:25.190
See, when you give
somebody money,

21:25.190 --> 21:26.732
you gotta
add that shit up
in your brain.

21:26.732 --> 21:28.773
You FICA.
You take the fuckin'
difference out!

21:28.773 --> 21:30.566
- You FICA!
- I'm not FICA!

21:30.566 --> 21:31.898
- ( doorbell rings )
- You "FIC'd" up.

21:31.898 --> 21:33.773
He just made money
on you!

21:33.773 --> 21:35.190
( doorbell rings )

21:37.065 --> 21:39.232
Ah. Hello.

21:39.232 --> 21:40.898
Ernest, Valentina.

21:40.898 --> 21:42.648
- Hi.
- Hello, Larry.

21:42.648 --> 21:43.732
Please, come in.

21:47.065 --> 21:49.815
Yeah.
Well, this is it.

21:49.815 --> 21:51.898
Looks great.

21:51.898 --> 21:53.482
( Leon chuckles )
Oh, man.

21:53.482 --> 21:55.232
Larry:
Oh, this is Leon.

21:55.232 --> 21:56.648
He lives in my guesthouse.

21:56.648 --> 21:58.566
- Hello, Leon.
- Leon: I like that look.

21:58.566 --> 22:01.149
- Yeah, I like that jacket.
- Thank you very much.

22:01.149 --> 22:02.566
My mother gave it to me.

22:02.566 --> 22:04.149
- Your mother gave you
the jacket?
- Yes.

22:04.149 --> 22:05.232
It was hers.

22:05.232 --> 22:06.648
- Larry: Really?
- Mm-hmm.

22:06.648 --> 22:08.107
They make that bag for men?

22:09.524 --> 22:12.149
Yes, this bag is made
for men, women,

22:12.149 --> 22:14.607
anybody who enjoys
carrying things around.

22:14.607 --> 22:17.274
- You two are married?
- Yeah. Yes.

22:17.274 --> 22:20.690
- So you got on one knee
and asked her to marry you?
- Ernst: No, no, no.

22:20.690 --> 22:22.648
It was during
the intermission
of "Swan Lake."

22:22.648 --> 22:24.524
I just looked to her and said,
"Will you marry me?"

22:24.524 --> 22:26.607
Larry:
Okay, that's a ballet,
all right? You got it?

22:26.607 --> 22:28.607
- Last one.
- No, no! No last one.

22:28.607 --> 22:31.190
Did you get on top of her
on the honeymoon night?

22:31.190 --> 22:32.773
Shut the fuck up.
Get out of here.

22:32.773 --> 22:34.357
I'm just asking questions.

22:34.357 --> 22:37.149
Don't ask any more
questions, okay?
Shut up.

22:37.149 --> 22:40.065
Um, you guys interested
in a house tour?

22:40.065 --> 22:42.857
- S-Sure.
- Okay.

22:42.857 --> 22:44.648
Will you be
joining us, Leon?

22:44.648 --> 22:45.982
Yeah.

22:45.982 --> 22:47.024
Cool.

22:50.316 --> 22:51.815
Is that good?

22:51.815 --> 22:53.441
Dining room,
kitchen's that way.

22:53.441 --> 22:54.857
By the way,
make yourself at home.

22:54.857 --> 22:56.857
You know, feel free
to use the refrigerator.

22:56.857 --> 22:59.441
You've got
refrigerator privileges.
How's that?

22:59.441 --> 23:00.648
- Cool.
- Thank you.

23:00.648 --> 23:04.149
Before I forget,
this little gadget, okay?

23:04.149 --> 23:05.607
Watch this.

23:05.607 --> 23:07.857
You want the curtains down,
you press that button,

23:07.857 --> 23:09.815
now you stop it,
and now they go up.

23:09.815 --> 23:11.815
Isn't that great?
I love this thing.

23:11.815 --> 23:13.399
Love it.

23:13.399 --> 23:16.065
I don't see why
I would ever need that.

23:16.065 --> 23:17.482
No, no!
Look, look! See?

23:17.482 --> 23:18.815
Here, look.

23:18.815 --> 23:20.482
Voila!

23:20.482 --> 23:23.399
You're showing us
the same function?

23:23.399 --> 23:25.357
Yeah, I guess.

23:25.357 --> 23:27.357
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

23:27.357 --> 23:28.690
Um... oh.

23:28.690 --> 23:30.107
Bedrooms are upstairs,

23:30.107 --> 23:32.857
and, uh, there are
two guest rooms if you'd like.

23:32.857 --> 23:34.648
Whoo!

23:34.648 --> 23:36.857
Why would we need
two bedrooms?

23:36.857 --> 23:39.857
No, no-- no reason.
Uh...

23:39.857 --> 23:41.065
No reason?

23:41.065 --> 23:42.566
We are husband and wife.

23:42.566 --> 23:44.566
We sleep in one bedroom.

23:44.566 --> 23:47.482
No, but I know a lot of people
who sleep in separate bedrooms.

23:47.482 --> 23:48.524
Couples.
Yeah.

23:48.524 --> 23:50.107
- Really? Like who?
- Mmm.

23:50.107 --> 23:52.524
You want names?
Okay, I'll give you names.

23:52.524 --> 23:55.524
Um, Pete Rose,
Tony Perez,

23:55.524 --> 23:58.316
Johnny Bench,
uh, George Foster,

23:58.316 --> 23:59.773
Dave Concepción.

23:59.773 --> 24:02.065
You-- you've named
six old baseball players

24:02.065 --> 24:04.898
who are married but sleep
in separate bedrooms?

24:04.898 --> 24:06.482
Yeah.

24:06.482 --> 24:08.357
Even the Hit King?

24:08.357 --> 24:11.607
Yeah.
Hit King especially.

24:11.607 --> 24:14.441
Well, we sleep
in a bedroom together.

24:14.441 --> 24:16.732
- Yeah.
- You know what, um...

24:16.732 --> 24:19.732
Let's forget about it.
I'm-- I'm-- I'm sorry.

24:19.732 --> 24:22.190
I'm sorry,
was that an apology?

24:22.190 --> 24:23.399
No good?

24:23.399 --> 24:26.107
There wasn't really
any emotion to it.

24:26.107 --> 24:29.232
Yeah. Your eyes
were bouncing around
like a cat with strings.

24:29.232 --> 24:32.190
- Valentina: Yeah.
- Well, I'm really sorry
if my apology was--

24:32.190 --> 24:33.566
was not sufficient.

24:33.566 --> 24:35.982
You've just apologized
for your apology?

24:35.982 --> 24:38.982
- Yes!
- That was better
than the first apology.

24:38.982 --> 24:41.399
Why don't you
just use that apology?

24:41.399 --> 24:44.024
You know what, Larry,
we're gonna go upstairs

24:44.024 --> 24:47.441
to, uh, the one
guest bedroom.

24:47.441 --> 24:48.982
Perfectly acceptable.

24:57.982 --> 25:00.607
You got yourself
in some shit this time.

25:00.607 --> 25:02.773
They're a couple
of freaks, man.

25:08.107 --> 25:09.773
Susie:
Could you believe
this kitchen?

25:09.773 --> 25:11.149
- And you know
what a great cook I am.
- Yeah.

25:11.149 --> 25:13.190
The meals I make here--
right, Jeff?

25:13.190 --> 25:16.232
- Yeah.
- It must have cost millions
upon millions of dollars.

25:16.232 --> 25:17.607
Well, it's big,
but it's intimate.

25:17.607 --> 25:18.898
We sit by the fire.

25:18.898 --> 25:20.940
- It's cozy, it's warm.
- Larry: Cozy?

25:20.940 --> 25:22.107
This is cozy?

25:22.107 --> 25:24.316
This is the best party house.
Right, Jeff?

25:24.316 --> 25:27.773
- Yeah.
- So, did you figure it out
about Saturday?

25:27.773 --> 25:29.815
Yeah, yeah, I got
the whole thing
figured out.

25:29.815 --> 25:31.648
I'm gonna go to paintball,
then I'm gonna go
to the wedding.

25:31.648 --> 25:34.815
Because Sammi,
when I mentioned that
you had some problems

25:34.815 --> 25:37.232
and conflict,
you should have seen
the look on her face.

25:37.232 --> 25:39.773
Susie, let me
tell you something, okay?

25:39.773 --> 25:42.441
I've known Sammi
since she was born.

25:42.441 --> 25:46.274
And one of the great joys
in my life has--

25:46.274 --> 25:49.982
has been watching her
blossom into this beautiful,
sophisticated young lady.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.107
Mm-hmm.

25:51.107 --> 25:53.482
I won't miss
her wedding.
No way.

25:53.482 --> 25:55.524
Oh, Lar, that's so sweet.
Are you serious?

25:55.524 --> 25:58.065
- No.
- All right,
just fuckin' be there, okay?

25:58.065 --> 25:59.690
- Okay.
- Don't disappoint me.

25:59.690 --> 26:01.607
- No, I won't.
- So, uh...

26:01.607 --> 26:04.815
Victor's parents
are coming tonight,
Lisa and Paul.

26:04.815 --> 26:06.690
And they're deaf,
you know.

26:06.690 --> 26:08.773
Oh. What is that, mold?

26:08.773 --> 26:11.065
Susie:
It's not fucking mold!
It's cheese!

26:11.065 --> 26:12.857
- Cheese? Look at it.
- It's cheese.

26:12.857 --> 26:15.190
- ( doorbell rings )
- Oh, there's the Chesnicks.

26:15.190 --> 26:16.274
Wait till you meet them.

26:16.274 --> 26:18.690
They are just
such sweet people.

26:18.690 --> 26:20.149
( piano music playing )

26:20.149 --> 26:23.773
By the way,
this house...
oh, my God.

26:23.773 --> 26:27.441
- It's wrong.
- Yeah. Unbelievable
how life works, isn't it?

26:27.441 --> 26:29.857
Just to get laid.
I'm an idiot.

26:29.857 --> 26:31.232
- Oh.
- Susie: All right.

26:31.232 --> 26:33.524
- Larry: Okay. Yeah.
- Jeff: Oh, hi!

26:33.524 --> 26:34.815
- ( shouting )
How you doing, Victor?
- I'm good, man.

26:34.815 --> 26:36.024
- How you doing?
- Good.

26:36.024 --> 26:37.857
Hey, I want to introduce
my mom and my dad,

26:37.857 --> 26:38.898
Lisa and Paul.

26:38.898 --> 26:40.815
How do you do?
Hello.

26:40.815 --> 26:43.524
Hi. Larry.
Larry.

26:43.524 --> 26:44.732
Larry.

26:44.732 --> 26:46.274
Larry:
Rhymes with "Harry."

26:46.274 --> 26:47.524
- Hi, babe.
- What's going on?

26:47.524 --> 26:49.190
- Ask them how they met.
- Yeah.

26:49.190 --> 26:50.898
How did you two meet?

26:50.898 --> 26:53.274
Were you fixed up
because you're deaf?

26:53.274 --> 26:55.898
Ugh, stupid
fucking question.

26:55.898 --> 26:57.566
No, I'm not
asking them that.

26:57.566 --> 26:59.607
- I think it's a good question.
- It's a good question.

26:59.607 --> 27:02.274
I'd be curious, too.
I never asked it.

27:02.274 --> 27:04.566
Ah. Bathroom?
Around that way.

27:04.566 --> 27:05.898
Yeah, there.

27:07.065 --> 27:08.232
I'm hungry.

27:08.232 --> 27:09.857
- Yeah?
- Hungry. Let's eat.

27:09.857 --> 27:11.399
- No. We can't eat yet.
- Why?

27:11.399 --> 27:14.065
- Everybody's not here.
- Who are we waiting for?

27:14.065 --> 27:16.441
- Funkhouser.
- Who else?

27:16.441 --> 27:17.898
What? Again?

27:17.898 --> 27:19.607
He's a guest.
We're waiting
for him to eat.

27:19.607 --> 27:21.524
We're not gonna eat
before Funkhouser
gets here.

27:21.524 --> 27:23.690
- This is your policy?
- Yes, it's my policy.

27:25.024 --> 27:26.607
Yeah, "hold your horses."

27:26.607 --> 27:27.857
- "Hold your horses"?
- Yeah.

27:27.857 --> 27:29.898
This is-- this is
"Hold your horses"?

27:29.898 --> 27:31.232
That's a bad sign.

27:31.232 --> 27:34.232
"Hold your horses" is,
"Whoa, pull back!

27:34.232 --> 27:35.524
Hold your horses!"

27:35.524 --> 27:37.940
- Susie: Is that it?
( laughs )
- Yeah.

27:37.940 --> 27:39.441
Mine's better than yours.

27:39.441 --> 27:41.316
This? No.

27:41.316 --> 27:44.857
That's  "hold your horses."
Yeah. Thank you.

27:44.857 --> 27:47.190
I'll bet I could come up
with some good signs

27:47.190 --> 27:51.107
that would improve
sign language.

27:51.107 --> 27:52.690
How about "dog"?

27:52.690 --> 27:54.815
Susie:
Yeah. Yeah.

27:54.815 --> 27:56.441
- No.
- Jeff: What would you do?

27:56.441 --> 27:58.107
( panting )

27:58.107 --> 28:00.274
"Dog."

28:00.274 --> 28:03.982
- ( laughing )
- I can improve
the whole language.

28:05.149 --> 28:06.524
( Susie laughs )

28:06.524 --> 28:08.607
- Bullshit.
- Oh. ( laughing )

28:08.607 --> 28:09.982
- All right, you know what?
- Larry: No.

28:09.982 --> 28:11.690
I have people
I want you to meet.

28:11.690 --> 28:14.357
Come with me.
Enough of your nonsense.

28:14.357 --> 28:15.898
Hey, did I tell you

28:15.898 --> 28:19.149
that Lin hired a signer
for the show?

28:19.149 --> 28:21.566
And she's got
big, big boobs!

28:21.566 --> 28:23.357
Very buxomy,
you know?

28:23.357 --> 28:25.607
- They're gonna take away
from the show.
- Huge!

28:25.607 --> 28:27.648
So distracting.
She's, like, big!

28:27.648 --> 28:28.773
- Jeff: Really?
- Yeah.

28:28.773 --> 28:30.232
I can't wait.

28:30.232 --> 28:33.065
The interpreter

28:33.065 --> 28:34.607
at our show...

28:34.607 --> 28:37.607
A show-- ho ho!
It's a musical.

28:37.607 --> 28:39.815
Musical.
♪ Hey! Hello! ♪

28:39.815 --> 28:43.482
You know,
she has a big...

28:43.482 --> 28:44.566
big bosom.

28:44.566 --> 28:46.815
Yeah, the interpreter.
Yeah.

28:46.815 --> 28:48.773
Not that big. Yeah.
About-- yeah, there.

28:48.773 --> 28:50.857
- ( door closes )
- Jeff: He likes the bosom.

28:50.857 --> 28:52.524
Oh, I'm so sorry.

28:52.524 --> 28:55.065
I can't begin
to apologize enough.

28:55.065 --> 28:57.316
I know I'm late,
and I'm sorry!

28:57.316 --> 29:00.316
I'm sorry!
I'm so-- who's this?

29:00.316 --> 29:02.482
- That's Paul.
- I'm sorry.

29:02.482 --> 29:04.357
- Larry: Hey, it's okay.
- I'm so sorry!

29:04.357 --> 29:06.857
- It's a tremendous apology.
- I know, it's horrible!

29:06.857 --> 29:09.107
What can I say
to make it-- make it good?

29:09.107 --> 29:11.524
You don't have to say anything.
It's a fantastic apology.

29:11.524 --> 29:13.607
One of the best apologies
I've ever heard!

29:13.607 --> 29:15.065
Gave me the chills,
that apology.

29:15.065 --> 29:16.898
Oh, my God!
I feel like getting
down on my knees.

29:16.898 --> 29:18.399
I don't know
what else to do!

29:18.399 --> 29:20.648
I wish that
could be broadcast
on national television

29:20.648 --> 29:23.274
so people could
hear what an apology's
supposed to sound like!

29:23.274 --> 29:24.982
- That's why you're my friend.
- Thank you.

29:24.982 --> 29:27.316
What a fantastic
fucking apology that was!

29:27.316 --> 29:30.107
- Okay, thank you for--
thank you so much.
- That was so great.

29:30.107 --> 29:31.607
- Thank you very much.
- That was great.

29:31.607 --> 29:34.024
Thank you.
I feel better.

29:34.024 --> 29:36.107
All right, okay.
Everybody's here.

29:36.107 --> 29:38.399
- Let's eat!
- Let's eat!
Beautiful!

29:38.399 --> 29:40.024
- Let's do it.
- Come on, everybody.
Let's go!

29:40.024 --> 29:41.441
( Larry claps hands )
Dinner!

29:43.898 --> 29:46.190
- Susie: Larry,
I want you here.
- Sure.

29:46.190 --> 29:47.607
- Susie: There.
- Got it.

29:47.607 --> 29:49.566
( chatter continues )

29:51.482 --> 29:53.857
Larry:
Okay, let's try
this rewrite.

29:53.857 --> 29:56.065
...darling.

29:56.065 --> 29:58.399
- Woman: Hello, darling.
- Man: Good morning.

29:58.399 --> 30:01.357
- Woman: Yes.
- Hey, same pants
as yesterday.

30:01.357 --> 30:04.399
What's this?
What, are you tracking
my outfits now?

30:04.399 --> 30:05.982
Lin:
Just an observation.

30:05.982 --> 30:09.024
Huh. You know, for a guy
with so many other concerns,

30:09.024 --> 30:11.898
my trousers should be
at the bottom of your list.

30:11.898 --> 30:14.274
- Woman: Yes.
- Lin: Well, as long as
we're talking about it,

30:14.274 --> 30:16.399
am I crazy,
or have you worn them
three days in a row?

30:16.399 --> 30:18.524
- Oh, come on.
- Hey, do me a favor,
all right?

30:18.524 --> 30:20.857
Stop the tracking.
No one likes to be tracked!

30:20.857 --> 30:23.441
Woman:
Yes. How would you like it
if  we  tracked you?

30:23.441 --> 30:25.274
Do it.
I'm in hiding
with four outfits.

30:25.274 --> 30:26.940
You'll never see me
doubling up.

30:26.940 --> 30:28.773
You know why?
I rotate.

30:28.773 --> 30:31.149
All you gotta do
is rotate, baby.

30:31.149 --> 30:32.566
( laughing )

30:35.441 --> 30:38.441
- ( music playing )
- ( chatter, laughter )

30:41.607 --> 30:44.441
What the hell
is going on up there?

30:44.441 --> 30:46.982
( sniffs )
What is that?
What is that, incense?

30:46.982 --> 30:49.441
Yeah,
that's incense, brother.
( sniffs )

30:49.441 --> 30:52.524
You don't burn incense
in someone else's house.

30:52.524 --> 30:55.607
It's like cooking fish
or smoking a cigar.
It's a violation.

30:55.607 --> 30:58.441
- ( clamor continues )
- What the hell are they doing?

30:58.441 --> 31:00.149
( door knocker knocks )

31:05.107 --> 31:07.024
Hi. Is Ernst here?

31:07.024 --> 31:08.316
And Valentina.

31:09.524 --> 31:11.607
- Upstairs.
- Great.

31:11.607 --> 31:13.441
Ooh, lovely home.

31:13.441 --> 31:16.149
Yeah.
Yeah, really nice.

31:16.149 --> 31:18.107
Thanks for
your hospitality.

31:24.524 --> 31:26.232
( woman giggling )

31:26.232 --> 31:27.982
- Ernst: Hell-o.
- Woman: Hi.

31:27.982 --> 31:31.940
- ( music blaring )
- ( chatter, laughter )

31:35.524 --> 31:38.065
They're swinging!
They're swinging!

31:38.065 --> 31:40.857
( woman squealing )

32:08.441 --> 32:11.190
( gears rattling )

32:13.024 --> 32:15.690
- ( remote clatters )
- Leon: Whoo! ( laughs )

32:15.690 --> 32:17.648
You're a funny guy,
man.

32:17.648 --> 32:19.399
You got all
this sexual shit
going on,

32:19.399 --> 32:21.441
I'm in the guesthouse chilling,
you don't tell me about it?

32:21.441 --> 32:24.357
- How many people were here?
- 15, at least.

32:24.357 --> 32:25.815
Well, why'd
you let it go on?

32:25.815 --> 32:27.566
I thought
you were in on it!
I didn't know!

32:27.566 --> 32:28.732
Have you lost your mind?

32:28.732 --> 32:30.232
You think I knew
what was going on here?

32:30.232 --> 32:32.274
I thought
maybe you were--
were sleepfuckin'.

32:32.274 --> 32:33.898
- I don't know.
- Sleepfuckin'?

32:33.898 --> 32:35.524
Yeah. You know,
subconsciously,

32:35.524 --> 32:38.732
your brain is fuckin',
but your conscious mind--

32:38.732 --> 32:40.566
I don't think
I was sleepfuckin'.

32:40.566 --> 32:43.232
I have a hard
enough time wakefuckin'.
How am I gonna sleepfuck?

32:43.232 --> 32:45.190
- Cousins are gone?
- Everybody left.

32:45.190 --> 32:47.690
All right, look,
I got paintball today.

32:47.690 --> 32:48.940
We gotta get this place
cleaned up.

32:48.940 --> 32:50.441
I can't deal
with this today.

32:50.441 --> 32:51.441
Okay, I'll do it.

32:55.065 --> 32:58.149
They ransacked
the fridge and broke
the goddamn Jacuzzi, too.

32:58.149 --> 33:00.232
- Bastards.
- What are you doing?

33:00.232 --> 33:02.898
Last time I wore these pants,
F. Murray outfit tracked me.

33:02.898 --> 33:05.316
I can't wear them
around him anymore.
My favorite pants.

33:05.316 --> 33:07.274
- That's crazy, man.
- I'm so pissed.

33:07.274 --> 33:09.107
Just wear those.

33:09.107 --> 33:10.607
- These?
- Those are nice.

33:10.607 --> 33:12.107
Fine.

33:13.648 --> 33:15.441
Jesus,
I'm so goddamn late.

33:15.441 --> 33:17.482
( chatter, laughter )

33:17.482 --> 33:19.607
Josh, I love you.
You're gonna get
fuckin' shellacked

33:19.607 --> 33:20.940
if you're dancing
out there.

33:20.940 --> 33:22.940
We're out here
playing paintball, man!

33:22.940 --> 33:25.399
I go for the big dog.

33:25.399 --> 33:26.690
( laughs )

33:26.690 --> 33:28.648
I actually
upgraded mine.

33:28.648 --> 33:30.607
Are you guys
getting bitten up?

33:33.107 --> 33:35.441
- Hey. This is amazing.
- Larry: Hey!

33:35.441 --> 33:39.607
Yeah, uh, first of all,
so glad to see you here.

33:39.607 --> 33:41.024
You did it.
You did this.

33:41.024 --> 33:44.441
I did, but something
did occur to me, though,

33:44.441 --> 33:45.898
um, however.

33:45.898 --> 33:49.482
Uh, if you had taken
that commercial,

33:49.482 --> 33:51.316
the gross
would have been 1,200,

33:51.316 --> 33:55.940
but the net
would have been,
like, 700.

33:55.940 --> 33:57.357
Maybe 750.

33:57.357 --> 33:59.107
Yeah,
something like that.

33:59.107 --> 34:00.316
( scoffs )

34:00.316 --> 34:02.399
I'm actually...

34:02.399 --> 34:04.482
kind of losing money
on this deal.

34:04.482 --> 34:07.648
'Cause if you were
only gonna make $700,

34:07.648 --> 34:09.815
and I gave you 1,200,

34:09.815 --> 34:14.149
you know, it kind of feels
like you owe me... 500.

34:14.149 --> 34:15.898
Am I wrong?

34:15.898 --> 34:17.648
- Larry, you gave me
this gift.
- Yes.

34:17.648 --> 34:19.773
- I called you a prince.
- I am a prince.

34:19.773 --> 34:22.898
Now you're asking me
for a portion of the gift back.

34:22.898 --> 34:24.898
You're making
a profit off this!

34:24.898 --> 34:26.607
I'm gonna call you
a prick.

34:26.607 --> 34:29.190
With all due respect,
you are the prick.

34:29.190 --> 34:30.857
For accepting your gift?

34:30.857 --> 34:32.982
It shouldn't
be a gift, though.
I'm not giving you a gift.

34:32.982 --> 34:35.357
- Wait, hang on, hang on.
- I'm not FICA.

34:35.357 --> 34:36.732
I paid you the gross,

34:36.732 --> 34:39.149
and I should have
paid you the net.

34:39.149 --> 34:41.190
Why do you keep hiking
your britches up?

34:41.190 --> 34:43.190
Because I couldn't
wear the same pants
two days in a row

34:43.190 --> 34:44.982
because I got
an outfit tracker here,

34:44.982 --> 34:47.524
so I had to take these pants,
and they're too big on me,

34:47.524 --> 34:49.524
and I didn't have time
to put a belt on!

34:49.524 --> 34:51.232
I'm not giving you
the money back.

34:53.898 --> 34:56.149
Have fun today, Larry.

34:56.149 --> 34:57.815
I'm not the bad guy here!

34:57.815 --> 35:01.065
I'm-- I'm losing...
uh...

35:01.065 --> 35:03.190
I-- I'm not the bad guy.

35:03.190 --> 35:04.524
- Hey, Lar.
- Hey, Carly.

35:04.524 --> 35:05.773
- How you doing?
- Good.

35:05.773 --> 35:08.648
Larry, could I have
a word with you, please?

35:08.648 --> 35:11.065
If it isn't Big Murray. Hey.
You know what, Big Murray?

35:11.065 --> 35:14.107
'Cause of you, I couldn't wear
my favorite gray corduroys,

35:14.107 --> 35:16.482
and now I'm wearing pants
that are way too big for me.

35:16.482 --> 35:19.898
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about--
that scene in the kitchen.

35:19.898 --> 35:21.149
Funny, huh?

35:21.149 --> 35:23.274
Well, it was
a little insulting to me.

35:23.274 --> 35:26.065
Why?
Nobody knows you're the one
who outfit tracked me.

35:26.065 --> 35:28.274
Oh, you make me
very uncomfortable.

35:28.274 --> 35:31.065
- You know, you're judging me.
- I wasn't judging you.

35:31.065 --> 35:33.399
It felt like
it was a thin disguise
for insulting me.

35:33.399 --> 35:36.399
No. I would insult you
right to your face,
Big Murray.

35:36.399 --> 35:38.898
That's what I would think,
that you should insult me
to my face,

35:38.898 --> 35:41.399
but the problem is,
now I feel like

35:41.399 --> 35:43.524
I'm being tracked
because of what you did.

35:43.524 --> 35:46.065
I can't get up
in the morning anymore
without thinking,

35:46.065 --> 35:49.274
"Oh, gotta be careful.
Big Larry's watching you."

35:49.274 --> 35:51.773
Big Larry is not tracking
Big Murray.

35:51.773 --> 35:53.898
Big Larry
is tracking Big Murray.

35:53.898 --> 35:57.399
Big Larry has
better things to do
than track Big Murray.

35:57.399 --> 35:58.857
Then why are you
writing it all down?

35:58.857 --> 36:00.566
Hey, Larry, can I talk
to you a second?

36:00.566 --> 36:02.190
- Excuse me, Murray.
I'm sorry.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:02.190 --> 36:04.065
Be careful what you say
around this guy, huh?

36:04.065 --> 36:05.940
He's a Murray tracker!

36:05.940 --> 36:08.274
There's your outfit tracker,
right there.

36:08.274 --> 36:10.898
Hey, what's this I hear about
you asking Cody Gutcher
for his money back?

36:10.898 --> 36:13.190
Yeah, I asked Cody Gutcher
for my money back, yeah.

36:13.190 --> 36:15.566
But not all of it.
Just the money he owed me.

36:15.566 --> 36:18.607
Cody Gutcher is one
of the best company managers
in the fuckin' country!

36:18.607 --> 36:20.648
We almost lost him
to "Spring Awakening,"
and we have him!

36:20.648 --> 36:22.732
I don't give a shit
if Cody Gutcher goes
to "Spring Awakening!"

36:22.732 --> 36:25.024
I'm nice enough
to give him $1,200,

36:25.024 --> 36:27.149
and he steals 450 of it!

36:27.149 --> 36:30.107
You're nice enough
to do the gesture.
Finish the gesture.

36:30.107 --> 36:32.690
I did finish the gesture,
then I was expecting
a gesture from him!

36:32.690 --> 36:34.940
No. "Here's a gesture.
Where's my gesture back,
motherfucker?!"

36:34.940 --> 36:36.357
That's your version
of a gesture?

36:36.357 --> 36:37.940
You got something
off your chest.
Are you happy?

36:37.940 --> 36:39.648
- Yeah.
- I got something
on my chest, okay?

36:39.648 --> 36:43.149
- Go for it.
- Valentina Miranda
and her husband Ernst,

36:43.149 --> 36:45.190
who I was generous enough
to let stay in my house--

36:45.190 --> 36:47.357
Yeah, and I said,
"Thank you."

36:47.357 --> 36:49.648
- They're swingers.
- Yeah, I know.

36:49.648 --> 36:51.690
You know they're swingers,
you don't tell me?!

36:51.690 --> 36:53.732
I told you they were
an interesting couple.

36:53.732 --> 36:54.940
"Interesting"
is not "swinging!"

36:54.940 --> 36:56.566
I was there
when you met them.

36:56.566 --> 36:58.773
You said,
"Make yourself at home.
Stay as long as you want."

36:58.773 --> 37:01.607
- So they entertained.
- Entertained?!
That's playing mah-jongg!

37:01.607 --> 37:04.107
This was like
a Roman orgy,
like Caligula!

37:04.107 --> 37:06.190
- You know what you do
in someone else's house?
- What?

37:06.190 --> 37:07.524
You tiptoe.

37:07.524 --> 37:10.274
You say please,
you say thank you,
you clean up.

37:10.274 --> 37:11.857
"May I use
your refrigerator?"

37:11.857 --> 37:14.898
Guests tiptoe!
That's what you do!

37:14.898 --> 37:17.441
Oh, no, I wanna
have fun at the fuckin'
Larry David house.

37:17.441 --> 37:19.857
Tiptoe and play mah-jongg,
that's your idea
of fuckin' fun.

37:19.857 --> 37:21.607
You should've seen.
They trashed the whole house!

37:21.607 --> 37:25.690
And you know what else?
They broke my curtain remote!

37:25.690 --> 37:28.482
- What the fuck's
a curtain remote?
- A curtain remote?

37:28.482 --> 37:31.857
It opens and closes,
opens and closes
the curtains!

37:31.857 --> 37:33.441
Who needs
a curtain remote?

37:33.441 --> 37:35.357
You fuckin' do this!
That's how you open a curtain!

37:35.357 --> 37:36.857
You've obviously never
used a curtain remote.

37:36.857 --> 37:38.732
Who would need one?
It's a curtain!

37:38.732 --> 37:40.482
It's a good thing!
It's a fun thing!

37:40.482 --> 37:42.857
If you ever did it,
you wouldn't even
think about it!

37:42.857 --> 37:44.190
Well, I'm never
coming to your house,

37:44.190 --> 37:45.524
'cause I don't want
to tiptoe around

37:45.524 --> 37:47.441
and maybe get
refrigerator privileges!

37:47.441 --> 37:49.441
You gesture-rescinding
motherfucker!

37:49.441 --> 37:52.232
- ( laughter )
- That's right.
That's right.

37:52.232 --> 37:55.524
At least I don't have cousins
who are sex degenerates!

37:55.524 --> 37:57.399
( laughter, murmuring )

37:57.399 --> 37:59.107
- What'd you say
about my family?
- You Mirandas!

37:59.107 --> 38:00.982
You don't give
proper "thank yous,"

38:00.982 --> 38:02.857
you don't give
proper "sorrys,"

38:02.857 --> 38:04.732
and you're a bunch
of sex perverts!

38:04.732 --> 38:07.441
All: Oh!
( murmuring )

38:07.441 --> 38:09.399
You've besmirched
the honor of my family,

38:09.399 --> 38:11.107
and I demand satisfaction.

38:12.566 --> 38:16.065
Satisfaction...
you shall have.

38:16.065 --> 38:18.065
( all murmuring )

38:19.773 --> 38:22.232
Cody:
It's a duel.

38:22.232 --> 38:24.857
These proceedings shall fall
under the auspices

38:24.857 --> 38:28.441
of the Code Duello--
Irish version.

38:28.441 --> 38:31.232
I'm given to understand
that one of the gentlemen

38:31.232 --> 38:33.940
has perceived a slight
and demands satisfaction.

38:33.940 --> 38:35.566
That's correct.

38:35.566 --> 38:38.190
Cody:
This is your final chance
to offer an apology,

38:38.190 --> 38:39.815
thereby saving face.

38:39.815 --> 38:41.648
No apology
is forthcoming.

38:41.648 --> 38:43.940
Very well.
We shall proceed.

38:43.940 --> 38:45.482
Gentlemen,
choose your weapon.

38:50.232 --> 38:54.815
Will anyone present
stand as the second
to the offended party?

38:54.815 --> 38:56.107
I will.

38:56.107 --> 38:57.607
Will anyone present
stand forth

38:57.607 --> 38:59.648
as the second
to the transgressor?

38:59.648 --> 39:02.065
I will.

39:02.065 --> 39:04.232
Swell.

39:04.232 --> 39:06.773
If the principals
would please hand
their weapons

39:06.773 --> 39:08.149
to their seconds

39:08.149 --> 39:11.274
to be inspected and loaded
with one projectile.

39:11.274 --> 39:13.607
- I don't know
how to do this.
- What?

39:13.607 --> 39:15.982
Why'd you volunteer
for second if you don't
know what you're doing?

39:15.982 --> 39:18.607
I'm from Newport Beach.
I've never loaded a gun before.

39:18.607 --> 39:20.274
Give me the paintball.

39:20.274 --> 39:22.732
- That's it.
There's nothing to it.
- Sorry.

39:22.732 --> 39:25.648
Very well.
Please stand
back-to-back.

39:30.149 --> 39:32.065
Gentlemen, on my count,

39:32.065 --> 39:35.149
you will proceed
to walk ten paces,

39:35.149 --> 39:36.732
at which point
you will turn,

39:36.732 --> 39:39.482
aim your weapons,
and fire.

39:41.982 --> 39:44.982
And ten, nine...

39:44.982 --> 39:47.982
( march playing )

39:50.482 --> 39:53.982
...eight, seven...

39:57.232 --> 39:59.982
...six, five,

39:59.982 --> 40:03.190
four, three,

40:03.190 --> 40:05.524
two, one!

40:05.524 --> 40:07.690
- ( pistol fires )
- ( Lin gasps )

40:07.690 --> 40:10.898
- Cody: Lin!
- Woman: Oh, my God!
It's in his mouth!

40:10.898 --> 40:13.857
- Man: Come on, Larry.
- It was-- it was an accident!

40:13.857 --> 40:15.607
I was gonna fire
in the air!

40:15.607 --> 40:18.316
( muffled )
Aaron Burr!

40:18.316 --> 40:20.982
- Aaron Burr!
- Larry: I'm not Aaron Burr!

40:20.982 --> 40:22.857
- Man: No, no, no!
- Cody: Lin!

40:25.107 --> 40:26.732
( march playing )

40:31.274 --> 40:33.566
( whispers )
Where the fuck is he?
He says he was gonna be here!

40:33.566 --> 40:35.607
- I don't know.
- I'm gonna fucking kill him.

40:35.607 --> 40:38.815
Family, friends,
and loved ones,

40:38.815 --> 40:40.898
we are gathered here today
to celebrate

40:40.898 --> 40:43.441
one of life's
greatest moments--

40:43.441 --> 40:47.857
the joining of two lives
in this union we call marriage.

40:47.857 --> 40:50.566
Victor and Sammi
have asked you today

40:50.566 --> 40:52.065
to be here
to bear witness

40:52.065 --> 40:53.857
and to offer
your love and support

40:53.857 --> 40:57.399
as they embark
on this next chapter
of their lives.

40:57.399 --> 41:01.149
Victor, we would be remiss
if we didn't thank you
for your service.

41:01.149 --> 41:05.982
Now, please take
each other's hands
for your vows.

41:05.982 --> 41:10.149
- Victor, do you take Sammi
to be your wife?
- Victor: I do.

41:10.149 --> 41:12.107
Officiant:
Do you commit yourself
to her happiness

41:12.107 --> 41:14.857
and self-fulfillment
as a person?

41:16.232 --> 41:18.316
I-- I do.
I do.

41:18.316 --> 41:21.898
- Do you promise to love--
- All right, enough, enough.
Excuse me, miss.

41:21.898 --> 41:23.482
- Out. You gotta go.
- What? What?

41:23.482 --> 41:24.773
Get the hell
outta here.

41:24.773 --> 41:26.566
- And cover up!
- What?

41:26.566 --> 41:27.982
Susie:
Sorry, everybody.

41:27.982 --> 41:30.399
It had to be done.
We'll just continue.

41:30.399 --> 41:33.065
C-Continue.
Continue.

41:33.065 --> 41:35.107
( siren wailing )

41:35.107 --> 41:37.107
Larry:
I'm not Burr.
I'm not Burr.

41:37.107 --> 41:38.524
I was gonna fire
in the air!

41:38.524 --> 41:39.857
You shot
right at me, Larry.

41:39.857 --> 41:41.232
No, it's Murray's fault,

41:41.232 --> 41:42.732
because he was
outfit tracking me

41:42.732 --> 41:44.232
and I had to put on
a different pair of pants,

41:44.232 --> 41:45.773
and they were
too big for me
and they fell.

41:45.773 --> 41:47.898
- ( coughs )
- Anyway, I'm so sorry.

41:47.898 --> 41:50.149
I'm really, really sorry.

41:50.149 --> 41:53.274
Really... truly sorry.

41:53.274 --> 41:55.441
- That's a pretty good apology.
- Really?

41:55.441 --> 41:58.274
- It's commensurate
with the offense.
- Yes?

41:58.274 --> 42:01.482
Do you wanna apologize
for falling asleep
during "Hamilton"?

42:01.482 --> 42:04.607
- Oh!
- My wife told me you were
practically on her shoulder.

42:04.607 --> 42:06.190
Okay, what happened was,

42:06.190 --> 42:08.815
I had a pain pill
in my pocket that
Jeff gave me,

42:08.815 --> 42:11.399
because I injured my shoulder
wrestling with you.

42:11.399 --> 42:13.065
So in a way,
you're a little--

42:13.065 --> 42:14.898
I'm at fault
for you sleeping
through my show?

42:14.898 --> 42:16.316
I did see part of the show.

42:16.316 --> 42:18.566
I have to say, I loved it.
It was terrific.

42:18.566 --> 42:21.024
- Thank you.
- ♪ My name is
Alexander Hamilton... ♪

42:21.024 --> 42:22.690
I didn't see the end
of the first act.

42:22.690 --> 42:24.190
♪ And there's
a million things
I haven't-- ♪

42:24.190 --> 42:25.482
- That's the very first song.
- Yeah.

42:25.482 --> 42:26.982
- I'm gonna go back.
- Okay.

42:26.982 --> 42:28.607
Any chance
you could, uh...

42:28.607 --> 42:30.815
I have to see what they say,
if they have tickets.

42:30.815 --> 42:34.024
- Two tickets. What's the--
- I don't run the ticket office,
Larry David.

42:34.024 --> 42:36.482
Make a phone call.
What do you mean?
You wrote the show.

42:36.482 --> 42:38.149
Oh, my God.
( coughing )

42:38.149 --> 42:39.940
Hey, hey,
you're spitting on me!

42:39.940 --> 42:42.524
- Cover your mouth
when you cough.
- Man, fuck you.

42:42.524 --> 42:44.482
Oh, my God.

42:44.482 --> 42:47.149
I gotta get to
Jeff's daughter's wedding!

42:47.149 --> 42:48.524
- I'm late!
- What?

42:48.524 --> 42:50.274
Yes, yeah,
I'm speaking there! Hey!

42:50.274 --> 42:52.024
- Driver.
- Hey, what the--

42:52.024 --> 42:55.441
Can we make a quick stop?
It's just at that light.

42:55.441 --> 42:56.898
It's about a half a mile
and you go up the hill.

42:56.898 --> 42:58.898
And you can drop me off.
It's two minutes.

42:58.898 --> 43:00.732
No. This is not
no fuckin' Uber.

43:00.732 --> 43:03.190
We gotta get this man
to the hospital.
He's injured.

43:03.190 --> 43:05.857
It's gonna be
a lot worse for me.
You don't know this woman.

43:05.857 --> 43:09.190
Fuck that woman!
And fuck her wedding.
Get in the back.

43:09.190 --> 43:10.690
- Okay.
- Fuck!

43:10.690 --> 43:12.607
Somebody strap him in!

43:12.607 --> 43:15.940
- ( sighs )
- ( Lin coughing )

43:15.940 --> 43:19.149
Oh, yeah.
Wait a second.

43:19.149 --> 43:21.149
Wait a second,
Charlie.

43:21.149 --> 43:22.815
Who are you calling, Larry?

43:22.815 --> 43:24.441
- This woman I met in a bar.
- ( touch-tones beeping )

43:24.441 --> 43:27.566
You're trying to get laid
on the way to the hospital?

43:27.566 --> 43:30.274
Hey, Marie.
It's Larry David.

43:30.274 --> 43:31.815
Remember, I met you
in the bar

43:31.815 --> 43:34.482
and you came and sat
at the table with us?

43:34.482 --> 43:36.732
Hey, I got a job for you.

43:36.732 --> 43:38.773
( music playing )

43:46.399 --> 43:49.648
Jeffrey, where's Larry?
He's still not here?

43:49.648 --> 43:51.857
- I don't know.
- But we have to start
the speeches.

43:51.857 --> 43:52.898
Well, start
the speeches!

43:52.898 --> 43:54.732
Get the fuck
outta my face!

43:54.732 --> 43:57.065
Go away!
Do the-- the patrons.

43:57.065 --> 44:00.232
- Jeff: What are you doing?
- Susie: Go do your job
somewhere. Go!

44:00.232 --> 44:02.065
Jeff, can you
call him again?

44:02.065 --> 44:04.149
I'm not trying him again.
I called him, he didn't answer.

44:04.149 --> 44:06.441
Marie:
I'm here. Hi.
Sorry I'm late.

44:06.441 --> 44:08.024
Oh, I'm Marie
from the restaurant.

44:08.024 --> 44:10.274
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- What are you doing here?

44:10.274 --> 44:12.065
Hi. Larry couldn't
be here...

44:12.065 --> 44:14.316
- ( sighs )
- ...but he asked me
to stand in.

44:14.316 --> 44:17.107
And don't worry,
I have his speech.

44:17.107 --> 44:18.441
( Susie groans )

44:18.441 --> 44:21.107
( glass clinking )

44:22.274 --> 44:24.732
"Hi. I'm Larry David."

44:24.732 --> 44:25.982
Oh, no.

44:25.982 --> 44:28.982
Her name's Marie.
Larry rents her.

44:28.982 --> 44:32.399
"And I just want to say
how thrilled I am
to be here today,

44:32.399 --> 44:34.648
and I am especially honored
to have been asked

44:34.648 --> 44:37.940
to speak
at this blessed event.

44:37.940 --> 44:41.107
I have known Sammi...

44:41.107 --> 44:44.274
for her entire life,
and frankly, I don't even think
she likes me very much.

44:44.274 --> 44:47.815
( chuckling )
But I'm pretty sure I feel
that way about everybody.

44:47.815 --> 44:50.648
Sammi, I wish I had
advice to offer you

44:50.648 --> 44:53.107
on how to have
a successful marriage,

44:53.107 --> 44:55.648
but I'll just offer you
two words:

44:55.648 --> 44:57.482
- separate bathrooms."
- Separate bathrooms.

44:57.482 --> 44:59.482
Okay, that's fine.
Thank you very much.

44:59.482 --> 45:02.982
- So, Sammi and--
what's your name again, sir?
- Thank you very much.

45:02.982 --> 45:04.316
- Victor.
- Marie: Oh, Victor!

45:04.316 --> 45:06.524
You need to be
going right now.
Thank you.

45:06.524 --> 45:09.274
- I'm sorry, everyone--
- Susie, can I, for my reel,
get a copy of that?

45:09.274 --> 45:10.316
Yeah, good-bye.

45:10.316 --> 45:12.399
Enjoy--
uh, enjoy

45:12.399 --> 45:14.982
the rest
of the... party.

45:21.690 --> 45:24.399
I talked
to Lin's doctors.

45:24.399 --> 45:27.107
They said he'll be fine
in about six months.

45:27.107 --> 45:29.815
But he's moving on
to other projects.

45:29.815 --> 45:32.815
He's done.
"Fatwa!" is over.

45:32.815 --> 45:34.982
Our investments are gone.

45:34.982 --> 45:37.524
Lewis lost money,
Danson lost money.

45:37.524 --> 45:39.690
I lost a ton, okay?

45:39.690 --> 45:42.648
I told all these ladies
I was a big-time Broadway
producer.

45:42.648 --> 45:44.566
Now I ain't shit.

45:44.566 --> 45:46.107
So how much
did we lose,
Jeffrey?

45:46.107 --> 45:48.274
We lost a lot of money.

45:48.274 --> 45:50.190
We're-- we're gonna
have to sell the house.

45:50.190 --> 45:53.357
We are not selling
that fuckin' house.

45:55.648 --> 45:58.357
Didn't you wear
that sweater yesterday?

46:00.815 --> 46:02.566
What did you say?

46:02.566 --> 46:04.648
What the fuck
did you just say?

46:04.648 --> 46:06.232
Well, don't get
so excited.
It was--

46:06.232 --> 46:07.857
Yeah, I wore this sweater
yesterday.

46:07.857 --> 46:10.274
So what?
What, are you
outfit tracking me?

46:10.274 --> 46:13.274
I'm not outfit tracking you.
I asked you a simple question.

46:13.274 --> 46:15.566
Sure sounds like
you're outfit tracking.
So what?

46:15.566 --> 46:18.607
I didn't work out in it.
I wasn't on the subway.
I didn't go in public toilets.

46:18.607 --> 46:20.732
The sweater's clean.
You can wear a sweater
two days in a row.

46:20.732 --> 46:22.690
It's not a shirt.
I don't wear a shirt
two days in a row.

46:22.690 --> 46:25.065
- It's just a sweater.
- What are you,
a fuckin' lunatic?

46:25.065 --> 46:26.898
You're an outfit tracker
and I don't like it!

46:26.898 --> 46:29.024
You can wear
the same sweater
two days in a-- oh!

46:29.024 --> 46:31.441
Here's your fruit salad
and your veggie burger.

46:31.441 --> 46:35.190
Oh, veggie burger.
Beautiful, beautiful.
Thank you.

46:35.190 --> 46:37.566
Hello?

46:37.566 --> 46:38.732
Where's my food?

46:38.732 --> 46:41.690
Aw. We'll start.

46:41.690 --> 46:43.857
Mmm.
This is fantastic!

46:43.857 --> 46:45.566
Mmm!

46:45.566 --> 46:46.441
Great!

47:04.274 --> 47:06.441
I know who you are.

47:06.441 --> 47:10.149
Yeah.
You're Larry David.

47:11.441 --> 47:14.566
- No, no, no--
- ( speaking Farsi )

47:14.566 --> 47:16.316
The fatwa's--
the fatwa's over!

47:16.316 --> 47:18.024
- They called the fatwa off!
- I don't believe you!

47:18.024 --> 47:20.107
You're a liar!
You're a blasphemer!

47:20.107 --> 47:22.274
- No! No!
Didn't they tell you?
- ( Farsi continues )

47:22.274 --> 47:24.815
No! No, it's true!
They called it off!

47:24.815 --> 47:26.274
No! No!

47:26.274 --> 47:28.316
- They-- they called it off!
- Stop! Stop!

47:28.316 --> 47:29.316
No! No!

47:29.316 --> 47:32.149
Larry David,
I am gonna kill you!

47:32.149 --> 47:33.399
Larry:
It's over!
