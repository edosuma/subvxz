00:19.152 --> 00:20.983
It's alive!

00:39.572 --> 00:42.803
My name is George W. Bush,
and I approved this message.

00:42.842 --> 00:44.867
Tacos rule.

00:48.681 --> 00:50.239
This is your brain.

00:50.283 --> 00:52.649
And this is heroin.

00:52.685 --> 00:55.381
This is what happens
to your brain on heroin.

00:58.358 --> 01:00.553
And this is what your body
goes through.

01:00.593 --> 01:02.618
But it's not over yet.

01:02.662 --> 01:04.459
This is what happens
to your grades...

01:04.497 --> 01:05.759
to your friends...

01:05.799 --> 01:06.788
And all your stuff!

01:06.833 --> 01:07.925
This is what happens
to the profits...

01:07.967 --> 01:09.195
from your grandma's
bake sale!

01:09.235 --> 01:11.100
This is what happens
to the world economy.

01:11.137 --> 01:13.628
And your boyfriend
gives you herpes simplex A!

01:13.673 --> 01:16.665
And you end up getting
a stupid tattoo of a unicorn...

01:16.709 --> 01:18.404
on your left ass cheek...

01:18.445 --> 01:21.073
that was supposed to be
a bitchin' firebird...

01:21.114 --> 01:24.845
but you were too strung out
to notice at the time!

01:33.993 --> 01:35.221
We just want to help!

01:36.463 --> 01:39.159
This is what happens
to family values!

01:39.199 --> 01:41.360
This is what happens
to the pollen count!

01:41.401 --> 01:42.732
Any questions?!

01:42.769 --> 01:45.465
Any questions?!

01:49.776 --> 01:51.300
This is the spot!

01:51.344 --> 01:53.835
The Decepticons
are using the dam below...

01:53.880 --> 01:56.314
to stockpile energon cubes.

01:56.349 --> 01:59.250
Megatron must be stopped!

01:59.285 --> 02:02.516
Autobots, transform and rol...

02:02.555 --> 02:04.079
Oh! Hold on a second.

02:14.901 --> 02:16.027
Are you OK?

02:16.069 --> 02:17.866
Let's get 'em!

02:24.878 --> 02:27.779
I shot the hell out of that guy!

02:27.814 --> 02:29.645
Good job, everyone!

02:29.682 --> 02:31.650
Megatron was defeated...

02:31.684 --> 02:34.744
with only fifty humans killed
in the crossfire.

02:34.787 --> 02:36.254
A new record!

02:36.289 --> 02:38.223
- Hurray!
- Hurray!

02:40.260 --> 02:42.057
Hey, Prowl,
have you noticed...

02:42.095 --> 02:45.428
how often Prime needs
to drain the lizard nowadays?

02:45.465 --> 02:49.868
Yeah, he must be French,
because he's a-peein'.

02:49.903 --> 02:52.804
I think that joke goes,
"You're-a-peein'."

02:52.839 --> 02:53.999
Ha ha.

02:54.040 --> 02:55.940
But I'm not.

02:55.975 --> 02:59.035
Ugh. Such a Retardicon.

03:01.114 --> 03:02.672
Uh-oh. I didn't think...

03:02.715 --> 03:05.912
going to the bathroom so often
was a problem...

03:05.952 --> 03:08.750
but just today,
I saw blood in my urine.

03:08.788 --> 03:11.586
Ew! Well,
I'd better have a look.

03:16.863 --> 03:19.229
Using the whole fist, doc?

03:19.265 --> 03:22.029
It's what I feared...
prostate cancer.

03:22.068 --> 03:23.467
And it's advanced.

03:23.503 --> 03:25.494
I'm sorry, Prime,
but you're going to die.

03:57.604 --> 04:00.300
Hi. I'm Optimus Prime.

04:00.340 --> 04:02.865
What you've just seen
was a dramatization...

04:02.909 --> 04:06.037
of what you, your friends,
and your family go through...

04:06.079 --> 04:10.038
if you don't get regular
prostate exams.

04:10.083 --> 04:14.850
Now, we transformers don't have
organic internal organs...

04:14.887 --> 04:16.649
and can't get cancer.

04:16.689 --> 04:20.386
But you do... and you can.

04:20.426 --> 04:23.554
So, get your ass checked out
before it's too late, turkeys!

04:23.596 --> 04:24.620
This has been a message...

04:24.664 --> 04:25.961
from the Cybertronian
Medical Association.

04:25.999 --> 04:29.765
Reality TV has never been
this honest, this brutal!

04:31.204 --> 04:32.728
Coming soon...

04:32.772 --> 04:37.004
it's <i>The World's Most One-sided</i>
<i>Fistfights Caught on Film!</i>

04:37.043 --> 04:40.911
Television too brutal to watch,
yet you can't turn away.

04:55.328 --> 04:57.023
Thursdays at 8 P. M...

04:57.063 --> 05:00.123
it's <i>The World's Most One-sided</i>
<i>Fistfights Caught on Film!</i>

05:02.302 --> 05:03.860
All right, guys,
I'll see you back in the yard.

05:03.903 --> 05:05.165
Hey, what the...

05:08.408 --> 05:10.137
Call a guard.

05:10.176 --> 05:12.167
It, uh...
it burns when I pee.

05:12.211 --> 05:14.372
What did I just tell you?!

05:14.414 --> 05:16.712
This newer tax
appropriations bill...

05:16.749 --> 05:18.376
will result in a...

05:18.418 --> 05:20.318
My name is Tiffany Montgomery
from Clifton, New Jersey...

05:20.353 --> 05:22.150
and I think
Senator Davidson rocks!

05:22.188 --> 05:23.348
Whoo!

05:23.389 --> 05:24.686
...wide-standing
ramifications...

05:24.724 --> 05:27.158
My name is Melanie Fratello
from Danbury, Connecticut...

05:27.193 --> 05:29.491
and I think legislation to cut
infrastructure funds 4%...

05:29.529 --> 05:31.463
in the upcoming
fiscal year rules! Whoo!

05:31.497 --> 05:34.057
Danbury High Fighting Tigers
forever! Whoo-hoo!

05:34.100 --> 05:36.591
Yo, coming straight at you,
we got an executive session...

05:36.636 --> 05:38.365
to consider the nominations...

05:38.404 --> 05:41.168
of three U.S.
District judges, y'all!

05:41.207 --> 05:43.402
Then later on, the Procedure
Oversight Committee...

05:43.443 --> 05:44.876
is holding a public hearing...

05:44.911 --> 05:47.402
that'll be
all up in your grille.

05:47.447 --> 05:49.915
But first, here's the results
of our internet poll...

05:49.949 --> 05:52.440
where you get to decide
the next speaker.

05:52.485 --> 05:54.043
And the winner is...

05:54.087 --> 05:58.114
oh, Byron L. Dorgan!
Oh, yeah!

05:58.157 --> 05:59.215
Thank you.

05:59.258 --> 06:00.816
As the representative...

06:00.860 --> 06:02.794
I'm so hungry.

06:02.829 --> 06:05.696
Hi, Mr. Hungry.
Can I call you so?

06:11.003 --> 06:14.700
Is everyone ready for more
of those hilarious bloopers?

06:14.741 --> 06:16.800
You know,
being a TV reporter...

06:16.843 --> 06:19.175
isn't all fires
and double homicides.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.975
When you can't
get your lines right...

06:21.013 --> 06:24.380
sometimes
the biggest story is you!

06:24.417 --> 06:26.510
There's nothing like
some tasty bamboo...

06:26.552 --> 06:28.179
especially when
you're Ling-Ling...

06:28.221 --> 06:30.985
who's traveled all the way
from China to visit, um...

06:31.023 --> 06:33.355
uh...
uh, I'm sorry.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.418
I just don't feel safe
next to this animal.

06:35.461 --> 06:37.156
It's completely harmless, Jerry.

06:37.196 --> 06:38.663
Are... are... are you sure?

06:38.698 --> 06:40.563
It's... it's just...
all right, all right.

06:40.600 --> 06:41.760
Still rolling.

06:41.801 --> 06:43.666
There's nothing like
a nice piece of bamboo...

06:43.703 --> 06:45.898
uh, when... Crap!

06:45.938 --> 06:47.200
Stop being such a wuss!

06:47.240 --> 06:50.209
I... I... I just...
Fine! Fine!

06:50.243 --> 06:51.471
Rolling.

06:51.511 --> 06:53.706
There's, uh, nothing like
a nice piece of bamboo...

06:53.746 --> 06:55.008
especially when...

06:57.450 --> 06:59.782
You just can't trust
the Chinese.

06:59.819 --> 07:02.617
There certainly weren't
any chinese in Hazzard County...

07:02.655 --> 07:05.954
but Bo and Luke
had problems of their own!

07:05.992 --> 07:07.584
Marker!

07:16.936 --> 07:18.528
Ow! My knee!

07:18.571 --> 07:22.940
Son of a bitch! Ow!

07:28.047 --> 07:30.106
Wait! Wait, John! I'm stuck.

07:30.149 --> 07:31.446
I'm stuck! I'm stuck!

07:32.852 --> 07:35.844
When David Duchovny announced
he was leaving <i>The X-Files...</i>

07:35.888 --> 07:38.550
producers had to scramble
to find a new male lead.

07:38.591 --> 07:42.118
Check out these
never-before-seen screen tests.

07:42.161 --> 07:43.788
Keanu Reeves screen test,
take one.

07:43.830 --> 07:44.990
So, you're telling me...

07:45.031 --> 07:46.931
we're dealing with
a sort of missing link...

07:46.966 --> 07:48.058
in the evolutionary chain?

07:48.100 --> 07:49.158
That's right, Scully.

07:49.202 --> 07:50.931
The scientific name
for this beast would be...

07:50.970 --> 07:54.167
Rondonondus marsipius,
from the genus Emplyaeclaes.

07:55.741 --> 07:57.606
Mr. T. Screen test, take one.

07:57.643 --> 07:59.133
So, you're telling me...

07:59.178 --> 08:00.770
we're dealing with
a sort of missing link...

08:00.813 --> 08:02.144
You damn right, Scully!

08:02.181 --> 08:03.944
Missing link between
the bugs and the humans!

08:03.983 --> 08:05.450
Talkin' 'bout bad for the kids!

08:05.485 --> 08:07.919
Don't play me
for no jibba-jabba, fool!

08:07.954 --> 08:11.412
Corky screen test, take 27.

08:11.457 --> 08:12.924
So, you're telling me...

08:12.959 --> 08:14.358
we're dealing with
a sort of missing link...

08:14.393 --> 08:16.258
in the evolutionary chain?

08:20.233 --> 08:21.860
I just made a doody...

08:21.901 --> 08:23.493
in my pants.

08:23.536 --> 08:25.595
You know,
Superman had a movie serial...

08:25.638 --> 08:28.004
as far back as 1948...

08:28.040 --> 08:31.737
but the actor playing him
had his share of super problems.

08:31.777 --> 08:34.506
Help! Help me, Superman! Help!

08:34.547 --> 08:38.142
This looks like a job
for Superman!

08:40.253 --> 08:41.811
Should we keep going?

08:41.854 --> 08:42.946
Yeah? OK.

08:42.989 --> 08:44.456
Uh, uh, uh...

08:44.490 --> 08:47.152
even Superman
can't outrun, uh...

08:47.193 --> 08:48.285
a bullet!

08:48.327 --> 08:50.795
Oh, my face!
You hit me in the eye!

08:50.830 --> 08:53.628
- Why would you do that?
- Hurray! You're saved!

08:53.666 --> 08:56.658
Up, up, and away!

08:58.504 --> 09:01.337
His lawyers called it
"heat exhaustion."

09:02.942 --> 09:04.910
Remember <i>Diff'rent Strokes?</i>

09:04.944 --> 09:07.606
We got our hands on some footage
from that classic sitcom...

09:07.647 --> 09:09.877
that's never been seen before!

09:09.916 --> 09:11.508
Someone's been a bad, bad boy!

09:11.551 --> 09:12.882
Ow! Ow!

09:12.919 --> 09:15.046
- Bad, bad boy!
- Ow! Ow!

09:15.087 --> 09:17.681
Conrad, Gary, you're on.
Places, everyone.

09:17.723 --> 09:20.021
And, action.

09:20.059 --> 09:22.823
- Who wants ice cream?
- We do, we do!

09:22.862 --> 09:26.764
Here's a rare blooper from
that smash hit cartoon <i>Pokémon.</i>

09:26.799 --> 09:29.290
Pikachu. Pika, pika!

09:29.335 --> 09:30.859
Pika, pi!

09:30.903 --> 09:33.303
Squirtle, Squirtle!
Squirtle, Squirtle!

09:33.339 --> 09:35.364
Pika, pika, Pikachu!

09:35.408 --> 09:37.000
Pika, pika!

09:37.043 --> 09:38.510
Squirtle, Squirtle! Squirt...

09:38.544 --> 09:41.536
What the [Bleep] am I saying?!
No, I mean it!

09:41.581 --> 09:43.242
This [Bleep]
makes no sense at all!

09:43.282 --> 09:45.477
Say the line, Earl,
or you get the gas.

09:45.518 --> 09:48.885
For the love of Christ, kids,
go read a book or something!

09:48.921 --> 09:56.225
Next up is something I like
to call "Bloopers in Space"!

10:08.140 --> 10:10.005
We're in big trouble, Starbuck.

10:10.042 --> 10:12.374
Stop right there, humans!

10:12.411 --> 10:14.675
The actors playing
those nasty Cylons...

10:14.714 --> 10:17.877
on <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>
had all sorts of problems...

10:17.917 --> 10:19.942
maneuvering
in their bulky costumes.

10:19.986 --> 10:21.453
Just watch!

10:42.308 --> 10:43.832
Marker!

10:43.876 --> 10:46.071
I recommend...

11:02.995 --> 11:04.690
That's all the time
we have today...

11:04.730 --> 11:08.530
but come back next week
for more outrageous bloopers!
