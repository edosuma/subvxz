01:53.281 --> 01:57.618
- POOR BRIAN.

01:57.651 --> 01:59.353
[startled gasp]

01:59.387 --> 02:01.289
- BAG ALL THE NAILS.

02:03.391 --> 02:08.229
- IT WAS A BOMB.

02:08.262 --> 02:12.433
SOMEONE...
PLANTED A BOMB.

02:25.546 --> 02:26.714
- TED TELL YOU?

02:26.747 --> 02:30.851
- HOW MANY PEOPLE?
- 4 DEAD.

02:30.884 --> 02:35.223
67 WOUNDED.
11 OF THEM CRITICAL.

02:38.359 --> 02:41.795
IT'S A HELL OF A THING.

02:41.829 --> 02:45.333
NOT SOMETHING I EVER EXPECTED
TO HAPPEN IN PITTSBURGH.

02:45.366 --> 02:47.401
- WHAT ABOUT MICHAEL?

02:47.435 --> 02:49.803
- I...

02:49.837 --> 02:51.472
I SPOKE TO DEBBIE
A COUPLE OF MINUTES AGO.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.741
HE'S STILL IN SURGERY.
- ANY IDEA WHO DID IT?

02:53.774 --> 02:56.744
- NO.
- OBVIOUSLY...

02:56.777 --> 03:00.314
SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T CARE
FOR "STOP PROP 14."

03:00.348 --> 03:02.683
- WE'D PREFER IF YOU
DIDN'T TOUCH ANYTHING.

03:02.716 --> 03:05.453
WE'RE INTERVIEWING EVERYONE
WHO WORKED HERE.

03:05.486 --> 03:08.556
I'M GOING TO NEED STATEMENTS
FROM YOU TWO AS WELL.

03:08.589 --> 03:11.892
AND, UH, A COPY
OF THE GUEST LIST.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.594
- NOT A PROBLEM.

03:13.627 --> 03:16.864
- WHY DON'T YOU
TWO GO HOME?

03:23.371 --> 03:25.773
- COME ON, LET'S STOP
BY THE HOSPITAL,

03:25.806 --> 03:28.008
SEE IF THERE'S
AN UPDATE.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.644
- UH, YOU GO. I'VE GOT...
TOO MUCH TO DO HERE.

03:30.678 --> 03:33.847
I'VE GOT TO...GET THAT LIST
FOR THE COPS,

03:33.881 --> 03:37.851
GOT TO CALL THE
INSURANCE COMPANY.

03:37.885 --> 03:40.754
GET SOME ESTIMATES HOW MUCH IT'S
GOING TO COST TO REBUILD.

03:40.788 --> 03:43.891
- TED, IT'S 7:00 A.M.

03:53.634 --> 03:57.371
- GET THAT FROM TWO
DIFFERENT ANGLES, OKAY?

04:00.674 --> 04:04.478
[woman coughs]

04:04.512 --> 04:06.647
- NURSE GRAYSON TO
X-RAY LAB TWO.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.349
NURSE GRAYSON,
X-RAY LAB TWO.

04:08.382 --> 04:10.884
- EM, HONEY, WOULD YOU
SIT DOWN ALREADY?

04:10.918 --> 04:12.920
- SORRY.

04:12.953 --> 04:15.356
- WHY IN THE FUCK DOESN'T
SOMEBODY TELL US SOMETHING?

04:15.389 --> 04:17.691
- I'M SURE THEY WILL AS SOON AS
THERE'S SOMETHING TO TELL.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.427
- CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING
FROM THE CAFETERIA?

04:19.460 --> 04:20.961
COFFEE, A MUFFIN?

04:20.994 --> 04:25.666
- NO, THANKS, SUNSHINE.
DO YOU THINK SOMETHING'S WRONG?

04:25.699 --> 04:27.368
THAT'S WHY THEY
HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING?

04:27.401 --> 04:28.436
- DON'T GO THERE, PLEASE.

04:28.469 --> 04:30.404
PLEASE DON'T.

04:33.407 --> 04:36.310
- ANY WORD?
- WE'RE STILL WAITING.

04:36.344 --> 04:39.380
- YEAH, WE'VE GOTTEN
REAL GOOD AT THAT.

04:39.413 --> 04:43.917
- SOME OF US HAVE.
OTHERS, NOT SO MUCH.

04:43.951 --> 04:48.088
- DID YOU TALK TO CARL?
DID HE SAY ANYTHING?

04:48.121 --> 04:51.659
- UH, HE SAID
THAT HE LOVES YOU,

04:51.692 --> 04:55.062
AND THAT HE WISHES
HE WAS HERE.

04:55.095 --> 04:59.833
AND THAT IT
WAS A BOMB.

04:59.867 --> 05:03.737
- OH, MY GOD.

05:03.771 --> 05:04.938
- WELL, WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU THINK IT WAS?

05:04.972 --> 05:06.707
- WHAT KIND OF SICK FUCK

05:06.740 --> 05:08.676
WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

05:08.709 --> 05:10.411
THE KIND THAT WENT
TO MATTHEW SHEPARD'S FUNERAL

05:10.444 --> 05:11.945
WITH SIGNS SAYING
"YOUR SON'S BURNING IN HELL."

05:11.979 --> 05:14.348
THE KIND WE SAW DRIVING
DOWN LIBERTY AVENUE

05:14.382 --> 05:16.984
WITH BULLHORNS, SHOUTING
THEIR HATE SLOGANS.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.387
THE KIND THAT SUPPORT
PROPOSITION 14.

05:24.458 --> 05:27.428
[explosions]

05:27.461 --> 05:30.631
- TOMMY, LEAVE IT ALONE.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.366
- I HAVE TO GO.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.435
- HONEY?
- I-I'LL BE AT HOME.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.970
CALL ME AS SOON AS
YOU HEAR ANYTHING.

05:37.004 --> 05:40.441
- THE WHOLE WORLD'S
GONE CRAZY.

05:40.474 --> 05:44.478
THE WHOLE
FUCKING WORLD.

05:44.512 --> 05:47.648
DOCTOR RYAN?

05:47.681 --> 05:49.917
- WE HAD TO REMOVE
HIS SPLEEN.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.653
THERE WAS ALSO A LOT
OF INTERNAL BLEEDING,

05:52.686 --> 05:55.456
AS WE SUSPECTED,
BUT WE MANAGED TO STOP IT.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.124
- WILL HE BE ALL RIGHT?

05:57.157 --> 05:59.927
- I'M CAUTIOUSLY
OPTIMISTIC.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.563
I THINK
HE'LL BE FINE.

06:07.435 --> 06:10.771
- THANK YOU, GOD.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.473
I TOLD HIM HE'D BETTER
LOOK AFTER MICHAEL

06:12.506 --> 06:13.507
IF HE KNEW WHAT
WAS GOOD FOR HIM.

06:13.541 --> 06:14.642
- WHEN CAN WE SEE MICHAEL?

06:14.675 --> 06:16.009
HE'S IN
RECOVERY NOW.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.511
HE'LL BE SLEEPING
FOR MOST OF THE DAY,

06:17.545 --> 06:19.079
SO WHY DON'T
YOU ALL GO HOME

06:19.112 --> 06:22.049
AND GET SOME REST?

06:26.454 --> 06:29.890
- WHY DON'T WE ALL GO HOME
AND GET SOME REST?

06:29.923 --> 06:33.794
- I'M GOING TO STICK
AROUND FOR A WHILE.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.162
WHY DON'T YOU GO,
HONEY, HUH?

06:35.195 --> 06:36.964
TAKE A SHOWER.
DON'T YOU HAVE A CLASS?

06:36.997 --> 06:39.533
- OH, GOD, NO, I COULDN'T.
WHAT--WHAT IF HE WAKES UP?

06:39.567 --> 06:41.802
THE DOCTOR SAID HE'S GOING TO BE
SLEEPING MOST OF THE DAY.

06:41.835 --> 06:45.506
THERE'S NO POINT IN THE TWO
OF US SITTING HERE.

06:45.539 --> 06:47.775
- YOU BETTER LISTEN
TO WHAT SHE SAYS.

06:47.808 --> 06:51.545
GOD DID.

06:51.579 --> 06:54.815
- THAT'S WONDERFUL!
YOU MUST BE SO RELIEVED.

06:54.848 --> 06:58.118
WE'RE ALL RELIEVED.
WE'LL BE BY LATER.

06:58.151 --> 07:00.721
DO YOU NEED
ANYTHING?

07:00.754 --> 07:01.855
WELL, BE SURE TO TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF.

07:01.889 --> 07:04.191
THAT'S IMPORTANT, TOO.
BYE.

07:04.224 --> 07:07.127
MICHAEL'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.
- AAH.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.797
- THEY EXPECT A FULL RECOVERY.
- THANK GOD.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.799
OOPS.
[spitting]

07:11.832 --> 07:13.567
- WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

07:13.601 --> 07:15.469
- I DON'T WANT TO PUT
A KENAHORA ON IT.

07:15.503 --> 07:16.937
DID YOU HEAR THAT,
SWEETIE?

07:16.970 --> 07:20.541
DADDY'S GOING TO
BE AS GOOD AS NEW.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.209
YOU KNOW...

07:22.242 --> 07:25.145
I REALIZED SOMETHING
WHEN I WOKE UP THIS MORNING.

07:25.178 --> 07:26.947
- OH, YEAH?
WHAT'S THAT?

07:26.980 --> 07:29.550
- THAT I WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE
FIRST THING EVERY DAY

07:29.583 --> 07:31.451
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

07:35.589 --> 07:38.726
- YOURS TOO.
- MOMMY, I WANT MY BREAKFAST.

07:38.759 --> 07:44.031
- OH, SORRY.
THE MASTER WANTS HIS BANANA.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.639
- WE SHOULD GO
TO THE HOSPITAL.

07:51.672 --> 07:53.040
- WHY DON'T WE STOP BY
THIS AFTERNOON?

07:53.073 --> 07:56.009
- MAYBE DUSTY CAN
WATCH THE KIDS.

08:01.915 --> 08:04.852
- MOMMY.
- IT'S COMING.

08:04.885 --> 08:10.624
HEY, MARIE, IT'S MEL.
IS DUSTY THERE?

08:10.658 --> 08:12.526
WHAT'S WRONG?

08:15.629 --> 08:17.931
OH, GOD.

08:17.965 --> 08:20.634
- WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

08:20.668 --> 08:22.135
- WE DIDN'T KNOW.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.271
WE DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING,
SO WE JUST ASSUMED

08:24.304 --> 08:28.275
THAT EVERYTHING
WAS OKAY. I--

08:28.308 --> 08:32.546
WE'LL BE OVER
AS SOON AS WE CAN.

08:32.580 --> 08:36.083
OKAY.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.285
- WHAT?

08:38.318 --> 08:41.154
- DUSTY, SHE, UH...

08:41.188 --> 08:45.525
SHE WAS ONE OF THE...

08:50.831 --> 08:53.233
- OH.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.569
OH.

08:57.705 --> 09:01.074
- THANK GOD MY MOTHER HAS
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.976
WELL, IF I DIDN'T
HAVE TO BE WITH HER,

09:03.010 --> 09:04.912
I WOULD HAVE BEEN
THERE LAST NIGHT.

09:04.945 --> 09:08.081
- OH.

09:08.115 --> 09:11.318
IS EVERYONE PRESENT
AND ACCOUNTED FOR?

09:11.351 --> 09:15.122
- EXCEPT FOR PHIL FROM
THE ART DEPARTMENT.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.925
HE GOT TRAMPLED ON WHEN EVERYONE
WAS TRYING TO GET OUT.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.961
BROKEN HIP.
HE'LL BE LAID UP FOR A MONTH.

09:23.396 --> 09:27.367
- I'LL GIVE HIM A CALL...
AND SEND SOME FOOD...

09:27.400 --> 09:29.202
AND PORN.

09:29.236 --> 09:33.140
- THE BASIC ESSENTIALS.

09:33.173 --> 09:36.243
- JESUS, BRIAN,
WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?

09:36.276 --> 09:38.011
YOU SHOULD BE AT HOME,
GETTING SOME SHUT-EYE.

09:38.045 --> 09:41.882
- I TRIED.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.818
- WELL, YOU'LL
BE HAPPY TO KNOW

09:44.852 --> 09:47.020
THAT I ALREADY SUBMITTED A CLAIM
TO THE INSURANCE COMPANY.

09:47.054 --> 09:48.689
I'VE SPOKEN WITH
THREE CONTRACTORS.

09:48.722 --> 09:50.090
THEY'RE SUBMITTING BIDS.

09:50.123 --> 09:51.358
AND THE BUILDING
INSPECTOR'S CHECKING

09:51.391 --> 09:53.694
TO MAKE SURE THE
STRUCTURE'S SOUND, SO...

09:53.727 --> 09:58.699
- WELL, AREN'T YOU
FORGETTING SOMETHING?

09:58.732 --> 10:02.770
ARE YOU GOING TO ASK
HOW MICHAEL IS?

10:02.803 --> 10:05.372
RIGHT. I WAS
JUST ABOUT TO.

10:05.405 --> 10:09.710
- HE MADE IT
THROUGH SURGERY.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.078
HE'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

10:15.148 --> 10:18.318
- WELL, THAT'S, UH,
THAT'S GREAT NEWS.

10:18.351 --> 10:23.857
- SO WHY DON'T YOU PUT THE
ESTIMATES AND THE CONTRACTORS

10:23.891 --> 10:25.993
AND THE INSPECTORS
ON HOLD FOR A MINUTE,

10:26.026 --> 10:27.728
HAUL YOUR ASS DOWN
TO THE HOSPITAL?

10:27.761 --> 10:29.997
- I'M AFRAID YOU'LL
HAVE TO BRING BOUQUETS

10:30.030 --> 10:31.431
AND BON-BONS WITHOUT ME,
SINCE, AT THE MOMENT,

10:31.464 --> 10:33.000
I'M TRYING TO MAKE SURE
YOU GET YOUR BUSINESS

10:33.033 --> 10:34.868
BACK UP AND RUNNING
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

10:34.902 --> 10:37.871
FOR WHICH, BY THE WAY,
I DON'T EXPECT A THANK YOU.

10:37.905 --> 10:39.172
NOW, IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE ME,

10:39.206 --> 10:40.273
I PUT A CALL IN TO
DUSSENDORF PLUMBING

10:40.307 --> 10:43.811
ABOUT THE BROKEN
WATER MAIN.

10:43.844 --> 10:47.681
KLAUS, HI. SORRY TO KEEP YOU
ON HOLD SO LONG.

10:47.715 --> 10:49.016
- DOES ANYBODY KNOW
WHO DID IT?

10:49.049 --> 10:50.751
- IT WAS SOME FUCKING LUNATIC!

10:50.784 --> 10:54.154
- OR JERRY FALWELL.
- ISN'T THAT WHAT I JUST SAID?

10:54.187 --> 10:56.156
- I, UH, ASSUME
YOU'RE ALL AWARE

10:56.189 --> 10:58.058
OF WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT.

10:58.091 --> 10:59.760
- YEAH, THE ENTIRE
WORLD'S AWARE OF IT.

10:59.793 --> 11:03.697
IT WAS ON CNN.
- RIGHT. IN THAT CASE, I...

11:03.731 --> 11:05.198
THINK WE SHOULD FOREGO
DISCUSSING

11:05.232 --> 11:08.969
THE HOMOSEXUAL SUBTEXT
IN THE WORKS OF WILLA CATHER

11:09.002 --> 11:11.304
AND FOCUS INSTEAD
ON HOW WE RESPOND

11:11.338 --> 11:13.774
TO HATE CRIMES
AND ACTS OF VIOLENCE.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.208
- I'LL TELL YOU HOW WE RESPOND.
WE DO EXACTLY TO THEM

11:15.242 --> 11:16.443
WHAT THEY DID TO US.

11:16.476 --> 11:18.445
- WHAT GOOD DOES
"AN EYE FOR AN EYE" DO?

11:18.478 --> 11:20.313
THERE'LL JUST BE MORE BLIND
FOOLS RUNNING AROUND.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.782
- WE'RE FIGHTING
FOR OUR LIVES.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.784
- EVERY TIME SOME PRIEST
OR POLITICIAN

11:23.817 --> 11:25.185
STARTS SPOUTING OFF ABOUT

11:25.218 --> 11:26.987
HOW HOMOSEXUALITY'S IMMORAL
OR A SIN,

11:27.020 --> 11:28.956
THEY GIVE SOME FREAK
PERMISSION TO ATTACK US?

11:28.989 --> 11:30.490
- DO YOU REALLY WANT TO
STOOP TO THEIR LEVEL?

11:30.523 --> 11:32.192
- THOSE DRAG QUEENS AT
STONEWALL WEREN'T STOOPING

11:32.225 --> 11:33.927
WHEN THEY STOOD UP
TO THE COPS.

11:33.961 --> 11:35.863
- I DON'T DISAGREE THAT FREEDOM
HAS TO BE FOUGHT FOR.

11:35.896 --> 11:40.067
BUT I BELIEVE OUR WEAPONS
SHOULD BE REASON, COMPASSION.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.002
- THE KIND OF COMPASSION
THEY SHOWED US LAST NIGHT?

11:42.035 --> 11:43.070
- IT'S TRUE. YOU CAN AFFORD
THE ENLIGHTENED WAY,

11:43.103 --> 11:44.504
PROFESSOR BRUCKNER.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.808
YOU TEACH AT A UNIVERSITY,
MAKE A GOOD SALARY,

11:47.841 --> 11:49.810
- YOU COULD EVEN PASS FOR
STRAIGHT IF YOU WANTED TO.

11:49.843 --> 11:52.212
- YOU LIVE IN A BUBBLE.
NOTHING CAN TOUCH YOU.

11:52.245 --> 11:54.748
[murmurs of agreement]

11:54.782 --> 11:59.753
- MY PARTNER...
MY HUSBAND...

11:59.787 --> 12:03.156
WAS CRITICALLY INJURED
LAST NIGHT IN THE BOMBING.

12:03.190 --> 12:04.657
HE NEARLY DIED.

12:08.528 --> 12:12.132
IF I LIVE IN A BUBBLE...

12:12.165 --> 12:15.135
IT JUST BURST.

12:21.809 --> 12:25.512
- HEY, YOU.
COME ON IF YOU WANT A RIDE.

12:25.545 --> 12:32.485
*

12:43.230 --> 12:46.033
- HEY, COME
JOGGING WITH ME.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.868
FIVE MILES!

12:47.901 --> 12:50.337
HMM. OKAY,

12:50.370 --> 12:52.806
MAKE IT TWO.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.541
IT'LL DO YOU GOOD.

12:54.574 --> 12:56.343
EXERCISE ALWAYS
MAKES ME FEEL BETTER.

12:56.376 --> 12:59.980
- I AM EXERCISING.
SEE?

13:02.950 --> 13:04.284
WHEN I WAS A BOY,

13:04.317 --> 13:07.020
AND THE WORLD WAS
DARK AND GLOOMY,

13:07.054 --> 13:09.356
WHICH WAS PRETTY
MUCH EVERY DAY,

13:09.389 --> 13:11.324
AUNT LULAH WOULD MAKE
ME VANILLA PUDDING

13:11.358 --> 13:13.560
WITH MAPLE SYRUP.

13:13.593 --> 13:15.963
HOW I KEPT MY FIGURE,
I'LL NEVER KNOW.

13:15.996 --> 13:21.902
BUT IT ALWAYS
CHEERED ME UP.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.904
- THEY ASKED ME TO SAY
A FEW WORDS TONIGHT

13:23.937 --> 13:26.573
AT THE
CANDLELIGHT VIGIL.

13:26.606 --> 13:30.810
- YOU TURNED THEM DOWN?
- I SAID YES.

13:32.545 --> 13:34.581
WHY SO SURPRISED?

13:34.614 --> 13:37.918
- WELL, WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT
BEING A "PROFESSIONAL FAG."

13:37.951 --> 13:40.854
- THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH BEING GAY OR STRAIGHT.

13:40.888 --> 13:42.956
IT'S ABOUT BEING
A HUMAN BEING.

13:42.990 --> 13:46.927
- [sighs]
MEN.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.495
- THAT'S US.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.931
- I'M GLAD DEBBIE'S SON'S
GOING TO BE OKAY.

13:50.964 --> 13:53.333
- IT'S A RELIEF FOR ALL OF US.
IT'S BEEN A ROUGH NIGHT.

13:53.366 --> 13:57.204
- THERE'S PLENTY OF PUDDING.
- I'LL PASS.

13:57.237 --> 14:00.974
I'M GOING TO SHOWER
AND GRAB A QUICK NAP,

14:01.008 --> 14:02.943
THEN HEAD OVER
TO THE HOSPITAL.

14:02.976 --> 14:05.345
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

14:05.378 --> 14:06.613
- YOU CAN CALL ME
VERA, IF YOU LIKE.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.415
- YOU LIVE IN LOS ANGELES?
- NO.

14:08.448 --> 14:12.019
- SO HOW ABOUT
COMING WITH ME...

14:12.052 --> 14:13.253
TO THE VIGIL?

14:13.286 --> 14:17.024
- ACTUALLY,
I DON'T THINK SO.

14:17.057 --> 14:19.559
- THEN WE'LL MEET UP?

14:19.592 --> 14:21.561
- ACTUALLY, I'M NOT GOING.

14:21.594 --> 14:24.031
- ACTUALLY, YOU SHOULD.

14:24.064 --> 14:26.166
IT'S TO HONOR ALL THOSE
WHO WERE KILLED OR INJURED.

14:26.199 --> 14:29.236
- I KNOW WHAT IT'S FOR.
I PREFER TO STAY HERE.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.138
- EATING YOUR PUDDING?

14:31.171 --> 14:36.309
- YOU GO.
TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT.

14:47.420 --> 14:51.124
- THE DEAL WAS THAT
WE'D TAKE TURNS.

14:51.158 --> 14:53.994
YOU KNOW, FIRST YOU,
THEN ME.

14:54.027 --> 14:57.530
WELL, YOU'VE HAD
YOUR TURN, SO...

14:57.564 --> 15:00.200
GO HOME AND GET SOME SLEEP.
- ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.569
- GOOD.
- IN A FEW MINUTES.

15:02.602 --> 15:06.273
- [sighs]
ALL RIGHT THEN,

15:06.306 --> 15:09.476
AT LEAST LET ME
GET YOU SOME SOUP.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.478
THAT'D BE NICE.

15:11.511 --> 15:13.413
CHICKEN NOODLE
IF THEY HAVE IT. HERE...

15:13.446 --> 15:14.948
LET ME GIVE YOU SOME MONEY.

15:14.982 --> 15:17.284
- I CAN AFFORD TO BUY
YOU A CUP OF SOUP.

15:17.317 --> 15:19.219
MAKE IT A BOWL.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.621
YOU KNOW, I WAS...
I WAS, UM...

15:21.654 --> 15:25.092
I WAS JUST SITTING
HERE THINKING

15:25.125 --> 15:26.559
THE LAST TIME HE
WAS IN THE HOSPITAL,

15:26.593 --> 15:29.362
HE--HE WAS
EIGHT YEARS OLD.

15:29.396 --> 15:32.432
HAD TO HAVE
HIS TONSILS OUT.

15:32.465 --> 15:35.368
SCARED SHITLESS.
- [chuckles]

15:35.402 --> 15:38.071
- AND, UM, I BOUGHT
HIM ONE OF THOSE...

15:38.105 --> 15:40.307
THOSE LITTLE FLASHLIGHTS,
YOU KNOW, ON...

15:40.340 --> 15:42.175
ON THE END OF A KEY CHAIN.
- OH, YEAH.

15:42.209 --> 15:44.711
- AND...WE TURNED IT ON

15:44.744 --> 15:48.115
RIGHT BEFORE HE WAS
WHEELED INTO SURGERY.

15:48.148 --> 15:51.318
I TOLD HIM IT'D
KEEP HIM SAFE.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.653
- AND HE BELIEVED THAT?

15:53.686 --> 15:59.392
- OF COURSE NOT, BUT...
TOOK HIS MIND OFF THINGS.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.499
- SO WHERE'S
MY FLASHLIGHT?

16:06.533 --> 16:12.339
- SWEETHEART!
- HE-E-EY, BABY.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.274
- YOU SCARED THE SHIT
OUT OF US.

16:14.307 --> 16:17.377
- BUT THE DOCTOR SAID
YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.746
- WELL THAT'S GOOD.

16:19.779 --> 16:22.149
WH--WHAT HAPPENED?

16:22.182 --> 16:24.417
- SOME LUNATIC PLANTED
A FUCKING BOMB.

16:24.451 --> 16:26.019
- LET'S NOT TALK
ABOUT THAT NOW.

16:26.053 --> 16:28.555
YOU JUST REST.

16:28.588 --> 16:32.392
- YEAH, YEAH. BEN'S RIGHT.
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.627
NOW YOU JUST GET BETTER.
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

16:34.661 --> 16:37.564
AND WE'RE GOING TO BE
RIGHT HERE WITH YOU.

16:37.597 --> 16:41.268
SO WHERE IN THE HELL'S THAT SOUP
YOU WERE PROMISING ME?

16:46.406 --> 16:48.675
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK,
BROWN EYES.

16:53.680 --> 16:59.119
- WELL, DON'T LOOK
SO SURPRISED.

16:59.152 --> 17:04.324
- I LOVE HOW YOU'VE KEPT
THE ORIGINAL DETAILS.

17:04.357 --> 17:07.127
RUSTY PIPES...

17:07.160 --> 17:10.530
FILTHY WINDOWS...

17:10.563 --> 17:13.266
THE GRIME-
COVERED WALLS.

17:13.300 --> 17:15.602
- IT MAY NOT BE
THE COUNTRY MANOR OF MY DREAMS,

17:15.635 --> 17:19.706
WITH STABLES AND A POOL,
BUT AT LEAST IT'S MINE.

17:19.739 --> 17:23.143
YOU HUNGRY?

17:23.176 --> 17:25.278
- WHAT'VE YOU GOT?
- I DON'T.

17:25.312 --> 17:31.284
- THEN WHY DID YOU ASK?
- I CAN GO GET SOMETHING.

17:31.318 --> 17:33.720
- SPARE YOURSELF THE TRIP.

17:33.753 --> 17:38.325
I JUST STOPPED BY TO
SEE IF YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

17:38.358 --> 17:42.162
- I'M FINE, THANKS.
- GOOD.

17:42.195 --> 17:44.364
- I THOUGHT IF ANYONE
WOULD COME THROUGH

17:44.397 --> 17:49.336
ALL THIS UNRUFFLED,
IT'D BE YOU.

17:49.369 --> 17:52.105
- WHEN I WAS BASHED, I FOUND OUT
THAT THE BEST WAY TO SURVIVE,

17:52.139 --> 17:55.475
TO GO ON,
IS TO MAKE SOMETHING.

17:55.508 --> 17:58.111
A PAINTING, A NAPKIN HOLDER,
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

17:58.145 --> 18:00.313
JUST SO THAT YOU CAN
PROVE TO YOURSELF,

18:00.347 --> 18:03.650
AND TO THEM, THAT
THEY DIDN'T GET YOU...

18:03.683 --> 18:06.519
YOU'RE STILL HERE.

18:06.553 --> 18:08.621
- WELL, I'M GLAD YOU ARE.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.323
- BRIAN, YOU'RE GOING
TO GET PAINT ALL OVER YOUR...

18:10.357 --> 18:11.858
- DOESN'T MATTER.

18:11.891 --> 18:15.328
- DIDN'T YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID
TO YOU LAST NIGHT?

18:15.362 --> 18:17.530
- YES, I HEARD.

18:17.564 --> 18:21.468
YOU SAID
YOU LOVE ME.

18:21.501 --> 18:26.373
- THEN HOW ABOUT
MARRYING ME?

18:26.406 --> 18:29.476
- WHAT?
STOP BEING RIDICULOUS.

18:29.509 --> 18:34.747
- I'M NOT BEING
RIDICULOUS.

18:34.781 --> 18:38.751
I MEAN IT.
- YOU DON'T MEAN IT.

18:38.785 --> 18:42.389
HOW COULD MR. "I BELIEVE IN
FUCKING, NOT LOVE" MEAN IT?

18:42.422 --> 18:44.491
YOU DETEST MARRIAGE.

18:44.524 --> 18:46.359
YOU DETEST ANYBODY
WHO ENTERS INTO

18:46.393 --> 18:48.261
"AN IMITATION
HETEROSEXUAL UNION

18:48.295 --> 18:51.264
THAT BY ITS VERY NATURE
IS DOOMED TO FAIL."

18:51.298 --> 18:54.234
DID I GET THAT RIGHT?

18:54.267 --> 18:58.238
- HMM. WORD PERFECT.

18:58.271 --> 19:00.540
BUT I'VE CHANGED MY MIND.

19:00.573 --> 19:02.375
- WELL, SO HAVE I.

19:02.409 --> 19:04.377
I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF MARRYING SOMEONE

19:04.411 --> 19:07.414
WHO "BY HIS VERY NATURE
IS DOOMED TO FAIL."

19:07.447 --> 19:09.516
BESIDES, YOU'RE ONLY ASKING ME
BECAUSE YOU'RE FREAKED OUT

19:09.549 --> 19:11.150
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO MICHAEL.

19:15.488 --> 19:19.192
- WELL, I DID HAVE THIS DREAM.

19:19.226 --> 19:22.195
I WAS AT HIS
FUNERAL, BUT...

19:22.229 --> 19:24.664
HE WASN'T IN THE COFFIN--
I WAS.

19:24.697 --> 19:29.269
- THERE, YOU SEE?

19:29.302 --> 19:32.205
- NOW, AS SOON AS LIFE
RETURNS TO NORMAL, SO WILL YOU.

19:32.239 --> 19:34.874
BACK FROM THE DEAD.
- NOT WITHOUT YOU.

19:34.907 --> 19:39.679
- I KNOW YOU TOO WELL.
WAY TOO WELL.

19:39.712 --> 19:42.949
NOW, THANK YOU FOR
SAYING IT, BUT...

19:42.982 --> 19:46.253
THE ANSWER IS NO.

19:54.994 --> 19:56.863
- DISNEY WORLD?

19:56.896 --> 19:58.865
YOU WENT TO FUCKING
DISNEY WORLD?

19:58.898 --> 20:00.767
- LET HIM TALK, MA.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.302
- YEAH, DEB,
LET HIM TALK.

20:02.335 --> 20:03.436
- FINE. I'LL JUST FEED YOU

20:03.470 --> 20:05.638
AND KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.907
- WHEN I WAS A KID,
I'D ASK MY MOM TO TAKE ME,

20:07.940 --> 20:09.842
AND SHE'D ALWAYS SAY,
"SURE, HONEY, NEXT SUMMER,"

20:09.876 --> 20:12.479
BUT WE NEVER WENT, SO I
TOOK MYSELF AND HITCHED.

20:12.512 --> 20:14.781
- YOU HITCHED?
[clears throat]

20:14.814 --> 20:19.018
- YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO KNOW I
DIDN'T BLOW ANY OF THE DRIVERS.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.321
- YOU'RE A GOOD BOY.
- I'LL, UM--

20:21.354 --> 20:24.491
I'LL CHECK IN ON YOU LATER.

20:24.524 --> 20:26.493
- THAT'S THE LAST
WE'LL SEE OF HER.

20:26.526 --> 20:28.027
- I'M GLAD YOU FINALLY
GOT TO DISNEY WORLD.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.463
- I EVEN GOT A JOB THERE.

20:30.497 --> 20:32.932
- DOING WHAT?
- I WAS A DWARF.

20:32.965 --> 20:34.901
- YOU WERE A DWARF?

20:34.934 --> 20:38.037
- DOPEY. I WAS PRETTY
GOOD AT IT TOO.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.473
I'M THINKING MAYBE
I'LL BECOME AN ACTOR.

20:40.507 --> 20:42.509
- YOU CAN BE ANYTHING
YOU WANT,

20:42.542 --> 20:44.511
RIGHT AFTER YOU
BECOME A DOCTOR.

20:44.544 --> 20:46.513
- NOW IT'S MY TURN.

20:46.546 --> 20:48.381
YOU JUST LIE THERE AND
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

20:48.415 --> 20:50.350
- ANYWAY, WHEN I SAW
THE NEWS ABOUT BABYLON,

20:50.383 --> 20:52.352
I TRIED CALLING, BUT
THERE WAS NO ANSWER.

20:52.385 --> 20:54.521
SO I CALLED ELI AND MONTY.
THEY TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED.

20:54.554 --> 20:59.826
I GOT THE FIRST
PLANE I COULD.

20:59.859 --> 21:02.829
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
ALL RIGHT, AREN'T YOU?

21:02.862 --> 21:07.600
- NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE.

21:10.670 --> 21:13.373
- YOU STILL SITTING THERE
EATING PUDDING?

21:13.406 --> 21:15.041
- I MADE A BIG BATCH.

21:15.074 --> 21:16.576
- AFTERNOON CLASSIC,
SORRY, WRONG NUMBER,

21:16.609 --> 21:18.077
STARRING BARBARA STANWYCK.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.912
- YOU EVER SEE THIS MOVIE
SORRY, WRONG NUMBER,

21:19.946 --> 21:22.449
STARRING
MISS BARBARA STANWYCK?

21:22.482 --> 21:24.384
- CAN'T SAY AS I DID.

21:24.417 --> 21:25.652
- SHE KEEPS GETTING PHONE CALLS

21:25.685 --> 21:27.053
FROM SOMEONE WHO WANTS
TO KILL HER.

21:27.086 --> 21:29.389
- IT'S HER HUSBAND.

21:29.422 --> 21:31.558
- I THOUGHT YOU
NEVER SAW IT.

21:31.591 --> 21:35.528
- IF I CAN'T SOLVE A HOLLYWOOD
MOVIE, I SHOULD RETIRE.

21:35.562 --> 21:38.965
SHE NEVER LEAVES HER BED,
AND WEARS A FABULOUS PEIGNOIR.

21:38.998 --> 21:43.803
- YEAH, I CAN SEE WHY
IT APPEALS TO YOU.

21:43.836 --> 21:45.805
WHY DON'T YOU GET DRESSED
AND COME SEE MICHAEL WITH ME?

21:45.838 --> 21:51.010
HE'S AWAKE.
- THANK GOD.

21:51.043 --> 21:53.980
BUT IT'S NOT GOOD FOR HIM
TO HAVE TOO MANY VISITORS.

21:57.450 --> 21:59.118
WHAT? WHY ARE YOU
LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT?

21:59.151 --> 22:01.821
- AS SOMEONE WHO'S QUESTIONED
THOUSANDS OF SUSPECTS,

22:01.854 --> 22:05.892
YOU'RE ABOUT THE WORST
LIAR I'VE EVER HEARD.

22:05.925 --> 22:09.028
- ALL RIGHT, MISS MARPLE,
I CONFESS.

22:09.061 --> 22:12.499
I CAN'T GET OFF
THE FUCKING COUCH.

22:12.532 --> 22:13.866
[sighs]

22:13.900 --> 22:16.135
THE THOUGHT OF LEAVING
THE HOUSE, TERRIFIES ME.

22:16.168 --> 22:20.507
- YOU'RE IN SHOCK.
[sighs]

22:20.540 --> 22:23.009
I'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN
TIME AND TIME AGAIN.

22:23.042 --> 22:24.444
- SO WHAT AM I GOING TO DO,

22:24.477 --> 22:25.912
LIVE THE REST OF MY LIFE
IN SECLUSION,

22:25.945 --> 22:28.381
JUMPING OUT OF MY SKIN
EVERY TIME I HEAR A NOISE?

22:28.415 --> 22:30.383
[telephone rings]

22:30.417 --> 22:31.918
CASE IN POINT.

22:31.951 --> 22:35.622
- HELLO?

22:35.655 --> 22:37.890
YEAH. HI, HONEY.

22:37.924 --> 22:39.926
NO, I'M LEAVING
RIGHT NOW.

22:39.959 --> 22:43.062
I'LL SEE YOU
IN A BIT.

22:51.704 --> 22:56.175
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT
THIS KID ON THE FORCE.

22:56.208 --> 22:59.479
HE DIDN'T JUST
WANT TO BE A COP.

22:59.512 --> 23:01.948
HE HAD TO
BE SUPERCOP.

23:01.981 --> 23:05.184
HIS FIRST DAY
ON THE BEAT,

23:05.217 --> 23:07.554
HE'S DEALING WITH THIS
RUN-OF-THE-MILL

23:07.587 --> 23:09.922
DOMESTIC QUARREL.

23:09.956 --> 23:13.960
SUDDENLY, THE HUSBAND
TAKES OUT A GUN...

23:13.993 --> 23:17.497
AND SHOOTS HIS WIFE
AND HIS LITTLE GIRL

23:17.530 --> 23:21.634
RIGHT BEFORE HIS EYES.

23:21.668 --> 23:25.905
NEXT DAY, SUPERCOP
CAN'T GET OUT OF BED.

23:25.938 --> 23:29.208
LITERALLY, H-HE COULDN'T MOVE
HIS ARMS OR HIS LEGS.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.077
- I KNOW THE FEELING.

23:31.110 --> 23:33.179
- SO HE JUST LAID
THERE LIKE THAT

23:33.212 --> 23:37.950
UNTIL THIS BRILLIANT
REALIZATION CAME OVER HIM.

23:37.984 --> 23:39.919
BAD THINGS HAPPEN.

23:39.952 --> 23:42.522
AND JUST BECAUSE IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE YOUR JOB

23:42.555 --> 23:46.793
TO PREVENT THEM,
SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T.

23:46.826 --> 23:51.197
ALL HE COULD DO WAS
LIVE HIS LIFE EACH DAY.

23:51.230 --> 23:53.833
THAT'S ALL HE HAD.
THAT'S ALL HE HAD ANY...

23:53.866 --> 23:56.202
CONTROL OVER.

23:56.235 --> 24:00.607
- SO DID HE FINALLY
GET OUT OF BED?

24:03.843 --> 24:06.713
- YEAH. I DID.

24:09.582 --> 24:12.952
I GOT OUT OF BED
AND I WENT TO WORK.

24:12.985 --> 24:15.688
AND EVERY DAY SINCE THEN,

24:15.722 --> 24:17.957
I THANK GOD
FOR ONE MORE DAY,

24:17.990 --> 24:21.160
AND I PRAY THAT
I DON'T WASTE IT.

24:25.264 --> 24:28.568
- IT LOOKS WORSE THAN IT IS.
MOSTLY SUPERFICIAL DAMAGE.

24:28.601 --> 24:30.136
STRUCTURALLY,
THE BUILDING'S SOUND.

24:30.169 --> 24:31.738
- THAT'S A RELIEF.

24:31.771 --> 24:33.840
SO HOW MUCH ARE WE LOOKING AT,
AND HOW LONG?

24:33.873 --> 24:36.509
- I'D SAY ROUGHLY
A HUNDRED GRAND

24:36.543 --> 24:39.111
AND FOUR TO SIX WEEKS.

24:39.145 --> 24:40.747
- ALL RIGHT, LET ME
RUN IT PAST THE BOSS,

24:40.780 --> 24:44.016
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU.
- ALL RIGHT.

24:48.187 --> 24:51.157
- WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT?

24:54.627 --> 24:56.262
MUST BE MY LUCKY DAY.

24:56.295 --> 24:57.930
- WELL, THAT'S ONLY
THE BEGINNING.

24:57.964 --> 25:00.299
THE CONTRACTOR JUST
TOLD ME THAT BABYLON WILL BE

25:00.332 --> 25:02.134
BACK ON ITS DANCING FEET
IN NO TIME

25:02.168 --> 25:03.302
WITH ENOUGH INSURANCE
MONEY LEFT OVER

25:03.335 --> 25:05.672
TO PUT IN THAT
NEW SOUND SYSTEM.

25:05.705 --> 25:07.874
- THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

25:07.907 --> 25:11.277
EXCEPT I'VE DECIDED
NOT TO REOPEN THE CLUB.

25:11.310 --> 25:13.613
- WHAT?

25:13.646 --> 25:17.183
- BABYLON, IT'S HISTORY.

25:17.216 --> 25:19.652
- BUT IT'S YOUR BABY.
IT'S YOUR...YOUR TOY,

25:19.686 --> 25:22.221
YOUR PERSONAL PLAYGROUND.

25:22.254 --> 25:24.924
- BUT NOW IT'S
A BATTLEGROUND.

25:28.728 --> 25:31.230
- SO WHAT'RE YOU GOING
TO DO WITH IT?

25:31.263 --> 25:33.900
- WELL, YOU SAID THERE ARE
DEVELOPERS

25:33.933 --> 25:38.037
WHO WANT TO TEAR IT DOWN...
PUT UP A MINI-MALL.

25:38.070 --> 25:39.772
- AND YOU SAID
YOU'D SOONER DIE

25:39.806 --> 25:42.308
THAN SEE OUR HAPPY
HOMO HOME HOMOGENIZED.

25:42.341 --> 25:44.877
- ENOUGH PEOPLE
HAVE ALREADY DIED.

25:48.948 --> 25:52.585
ANYWAY...
WHO'D PAY 20 BUCKS

25:52.619 --> 25:58.024
TO DANCE TO THE MEMORY
OF BOMBS AND CORPSES?

26:02.895 --> 26:05.097
SEE YOU AT THE VIGIL.

26:06.866 --> 26:08.267
- HUH?

26:11.704 --> 26:13.806
- THE VIGIL TONIGHT.
I'LL SEE YOU THERE.

26:13.840 --> 26:16.242
- OH, YEAH, SURE.

26:26.118 --> 26:28.721
- A MEATLOAF,
A ROTISSERIE CHICKEN,

26:28.755 --> 26:30.723
MIXED VEGETABLES,
ROASTED POTATOES,

26:30.757 --> 26:33.726
A QUART OF FRUIT SALAD,
AND A DOZEN LEMON BARS.

26:33.760 --> 26:37.897
AND THAT GOES TO DUSTY...
I MEAN, TO MARIE LOGAN.

26:37.930 --> 26:43.102
HERE'S THE ADDRESS.

26:43.135 --> 26:45.004
- I'M USUALLY NOT THE ONE
TO BE IN DENIAL

26:45.037 --> 26:47.239
SINCE I'M ALWAYS EXPECTING
THE WORST ANYWAY.

26:47.273 --> 26:50.710
BUT THIS...
I JUST--

26:50.743 --> 26:53.312
I-I CAN'T BELIEVE
DUSTY'S DEAD.

26:53.345 --> 26:55.748
MICHAEL WAS
NEARLY KILLED,

26:55.782 --> 26:58.117
NOT TO MENTION ALL THE OTHERS.
- I KNOW.

26:58.150 --> 27:00.987
- IT'S JUST NOT SINKING IN.
- GIVE IT TIME.

27:01.020 --> 27:03.389
- TO BE HYSTERICAL?
FALL APART?

27:03.422 --> 27:08.260
I CAN HARDLY WAIT.

27:08.294 --> 27:10.396
- FOOD'S SENT. AT LEAST
THAT'LL BE ONE LESS THING

27:10.429 --> 27:12.765
MARIE WILL HAVE
TO DEAL WITH.

27:12.799 --> 27:14.734
- YOU KNOW WHAT
SHE TOLD ME?

27:14.767 --> 27:17.670
SHE HAS NO LEGAL
RIGHTS TO THOSE KIDS.

27:17.704 --> 27:20.740
PROP 14 PASSES, SHE WON'T EVEN
BE ALLOWED TO ADOPT THEM.

27:20.773 --> 27:22.809
THE STATE COULD EVEN
TAKE THEM AWAY FROM HER.

27:22.842 --> 27:24.043
- GOD.

27:24.076 --> 27:25.144
IT'S GOOD THING
YOU GUYS ARE BOTH

27:25.177 --> 27:26.779
GUS AND J.R.'S LEGAL PARENTS.

27:26.813 --> 27:28.214
WE'LL SEE HOW LONG
IT IS BEFORE THEY TRY

27:28.247 --> 27:29.949
AND TAKE AWAY THIRD-PARENT
ADOPTION.

27:29.982 --> 27:31.083
- ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT IS,

27:31.117 --> 27:32.284
WHAT IF IT HAD
BEEN ONE OF US?

27:32.318 --> 27:33.786
HOW WOULD YOU
OR I FEEL,

27:33.820 --> 27:35.021
KNOWING WE'D WASTED
THE LAST YEAR

27:35.054 --> 27:36.288
WE'D EVER HAVE TOGETHER

27:36.322 --> 27:38.157
UN-RECONCILED AND APART?

27:38.190 --> 27:40.026
- THE GOOD NEWS IS
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

27:40.059 --> 27:43.996
WE REALIZED WHAT WE'D LOST
BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE.

27:51.237 --> 27:53.039
- YEAH.

27:53.072 --> 27:56.709
- MY SHRINK DOUBLED
MY DOSE OF PROZAC.

27:56.743 --> 27:58.244
GOT ANYTHING TO
WASH IT DOWN WITH?

28:03.415 --> 28:07.119
WHO DO I LOOK LIKE
TO YOU, JUDY GARLAND?

28:21.968 --> 28:24.036
THANKS.

28:26.372 --> 28:30.076
CHRIST, WHAT
A NIGHTMARE.

28:30.109 --> 28:31.277
HAVE YOU SEEN MICHAEL?

28:31.310 --> 28:32.945
- UH, YEAH. I WENT
TO THE HOSPITAL.

28:32.979 --> 28:34.881
- I SPOKE TO DEBBIE.

28:34.914 --> 28:37.149
SHE'S A FUCKING
INSPIRATION.

28:37.183 --> 28:40.953
- I CAN TELL SHE'S HAD
A PROFOUND INFLUENCE.

28:40.987 --> 28:43.389
- I JUST THANK GOD
JUSTIN'S ALL RIGHT.

28:47.326 --> 28:49.762
AND YOU.

28:53.132 --> 28:55.101
SO...

28:55.134 --> 28:57.103
YOU WANT TO
SELL YOUR LOFT.

28:57.136 --> 28:58.971
- THAT'S THE PLAN.

28:59.005 --> 29:01.240
- YOU'RE MY FOURTH
CALL OF THE DAY.

29:01.273 --> 29:03.843
PEOPLE WANTING TO
FLEE LIBERTY AVENUE.

29:03.876 --> 29:06.779
I WOULDN'T HAVE PEGGED YOU
AS A PANIC SELLER.

29:06.813 --> 29:08.881
- I'M NOT.

29:08.915 --> 29:10.883
- HAVE YOU TOLD JUSTIN?

29:10.917 --> 29:14.520
- AND I'D PREFER IF
YOU DIDN'T EITHER.

29:14.553 --> 29:18.024
- I RESPECT MY
CLIENTS' PRIVACY.

29:20.226 --> 29:25.898
- ANYWAY...
WHAT'S THE POINT?

29:25.932 --> 29:29.001
I ASKED HIM
TO MARRY ME.

29:29.035 --> 29:31.570
- YOU WHAT?
- DON'T WORRY,

29:31.603 --> 29:34.874
HE TURNED ME DOWN.

29:34.907 --> 29:38.010
- I DIDN'T KNOW.

29:38.044 --> 29:40.813
- I JUST NEED TO DO THIS, NOW.
I-IT CAN'T WAIT.

29:40.847 --> 29:43.916
- UM, IT'S YOUR CALL.

29:43.950 --> 29:46.785
IF YOU COULD JUST
SIGN THESE...

29:53.359 --> 29:56.896
UM, WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO LEAVE YOU A COUPLE?

29:56.929 --> 29:59.531
- NO.

30:17.984 --> 30:22.121
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, I JUST
WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I'M...

30:22.154 --> 30:26.859
SORRY THAT I'M NOT GOING TO BE
YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW.

30:34.000 --> 30:38.237
- I WAS ASKED TO SAY
A FEW WORDS TONIGHT.

30:38.270 --> 30:42.074
I ASKED, "WHY?"

30:42.108 --> 30:45.511
THEY SAID, "BECAUSE
YOU'RE A HERO."

30:45.544 --> 30:50.349
A HERO.

30:50.382 --> 30:53.886
BECAUSE I
PLAY FOOTBALL?

30:53.920 --> 30:58.090
BECAUSE AFTER A
LIFETIME OF DENIAL...

30:58.124 --> 31:04.096
I WAS FINALLY HONEST
ABOUT WHO I AM?

31:04.130 --> 31:10.502
I DON'T CALL THAT HEROIC.

31:10.536 --> 31:14.006
WHAT IS HEROIC IS STANDING UP
FOR THE RIGHTS YOU DESERVE,

31:14.040 --> 31:19.011
NO MATTER WHAT
THE CONSEQUENCES.

31:19.045 --> 31:22.982
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
THOSE WHO WERE INJURED...

31:23.015 --> 31:27.519
AND WHO LOST THEIR LIVES
LAST NIGHT WERE DOING...

31:27.553 --> 31:32.324
OR TRYING TO BEFORE
THEY WERE STOPPED.

31:32.358 --> 31:35.928
BUT THEY WERE UP AGAINST
A POWERFUL OPPONENT...

31:35.962 --> 31:39.265
HATRED.

31:39.298 --> 31:42.034
HATRED SPREAD BY THOSE
THAT WANT TO DENY OTHERS

31:42.068 --> 31:44.937
WHAT'S RIGHTFULLY THEIRS...

31:44.971 --> 31:51.143
IN THE NAME OF THEIR GOD...
THEIR FAMILY...

31:51.177 --> 31:54.613
THEIR COUNTRY.

31:54.646 --> 32:00.686
I GUESS THEY FORGOT THAT AMERICA
BELONGS TO EVERYONE.

32:00.719 --> 32:04.156
NOW LET US TAKE A
MOMENT OF SILENCE

32:04.190 --> 32:08.060
FOR THOSE WHO
LOST THEIR LIVES.

32:25.211 --> 32:29.081
- MY SON, MICHAEL NOVOTNY...
[clears throat]

32:29.115 --> 32:32.518
WAS INJURED IN THE
EXPLOSION LAST NIGHT.

32:32.551 --> 32:36.755
IT WAS TOUCH-AND-GO
FOR A WHILE.

32:36.788 --> 32:41.260
I'M HERE TO SAY...

32:41.293 --> 32:42.761
THAT HE'S GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT.

32:42.794 --> 32:45.397
[applause]
- YEAH!

32:45.431 --> 32:48.067
- BUT THERE ARE OTHERS
WHO ARE NOT SO LUCKY.

32:48.100 --> 32:50.469
- YOUR SON SHOULD'VE DIED.

32:50.502 --> 32:52.104
[mixed murmuring]

32:52.138 --> 32:56.142
YOUR SON SHOULD
BURN IN HELL!

32:56.175 --> 32:58.744
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

32:58.777 --> 33:02.381
- FAGS DESERVE TO DIE.
- FAGS ARE AN ABOMINATION.

33:02.414 --> 33:06.085
- HER SON WILL
BURN IN HELL.

33:06.118 --> 33:08.087
- FUCK YOU.

33:08.120 --> 33:09.121
[yelling]

33:09.155 --> 33:11.123
- COME ON, GIVE IT TO HIM.

33:11.157 --> 33:14.093
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SHOULD DIE,
MOTHERFUCKER.

33:14.126 --> 33:20.366
- [grunting ]

33:20.399 --> 33:24.670
[yelling]

33:24.703 --> 33:26.238
- HEY, GET OFF OF HIM.

33:26.272 --> 33:29.508
- SHOW THAT FAG WHO'S BOSS.

33:29.541 --> 33:32.144
BUNCH OF FAGGOTS!

33:32.178 --> 33:34.580
[indistinct shouting]

33:40.286 --> 33:42.121
- COME ON,
THAT'S ENOUGH.

33:42.154 --> 33:44.656
THAT'S ENOUGH.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

33:44.690 --> 33:46.592
- YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
IT IS TO BE HUMAN,

33:46.625 --> 33:49.528
MUCH LESS
A CHRISTIAN.

33:49.561 --> 33:51.663
- GET OUT OF HERE.
GET OUT OF HERE.

33:51.697 --> 33:53.799
[siren chirps]

33:53.832 --> 33:56.235
- THE COPS ARE HERE.
THE COPS ARE HERE.

34:06.345 --> 34:09.615
- PLACE IS KIND
OF EMPTY TONIGHT.

34:17.523 --> 34:22.828
- EVERYONE'S AT THAT VIGIL.

34:22.861 --> 34:24.330
- WHY AREN'T YOU?

34:24.363 --> 34:30.436
- FUCKING'S THE BEST REVENGE.

34:30.469 --> 34:33.372
A NEIGHBOUR DOWN THE HALL
FROM ME WAS THERE.

34:33.405 --> 34:35.541
HE LOST HIS LEG.

34:41.680 --> 34:44.583
- ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS
GOT HURT TOO.

34:44.616 --> 34:46.618
- HOW'S HE DOING?

34:46.652 --> 34:49.121
- I DON'T KNOW.
I HAVEN'T BEEN TO THE HOSPITAL.

34:49.155 --> 34:51.623
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID
HE WAS A GOOD FRIEND.

34:55.227 --> 34:57.329
- IT NEVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED
IF IT WEREN'T FOR ME.

34:57.363 --> 35:02.901
- THE EXPLOSION?
- HIS GETTING HURT.

35:02.934 --> 35:06.472
I SENT HIM OVER TO THE BAR
TO GET A DRINK,

35:06.505 --> 35:09.508
AND THAT'S WHERE
THE BOMB WENT OFF.

35:09.541 --> 35:11.777
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

35:11.810 --> 35:13.879
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

35:13.912 --> 35:16.382
- WHAT?

35:16.415 --> 35:19.285
- I ALWAYS WANTED
TO MEET GOD.

35:19.318 --> 35:22.221
NOT ONLY DID I MEET HIM,
I FUCKED HIM.

35:22.254 --> 35:26.625
- WILL YOU JUST GO,
PLEASE?

35:26.658 --> 35:33.232
- IT'S YOUR SUITE,
SWEETHEART.

35:33.265 --> 35:35.267
- BUT DON'T YOU THINK
YOU'RE GIVING YOURSELF

35:35.301 --> 35:38.770
TOO MUCH CREDIT...

35:38.804 --> 35:41.507
THAT YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE?

35:41.540 --> 35:43.375
- IF I'D GONE TO GET
THE GODDAMNED DRINK MYSELF--

35:43.409 --> 35:45.711
- BUT YOU DIDN'T,
BLANCHE.

35:47.879 --> 35:49.515
SO WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?

35:49.548 --> 35:52.218
NAIL YOURSELF
TO THE CROSS?

35:59.291 --> 36:03.429
THERE.
YOU'RE ABSOLVED.

36:08.634 --> 36:11.270
- OH, GOD,
WHAT DID I JUST DO?

36:11.303 --> 36:14.840
- YOU NEARLY KILLED SOMEONE.
- DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO, UH--

36:18.310 --> 36:19.678
- HERE.

36:19.711 --> 36:23.282
THAT'S MY CUM TOWEL...

36:23.315 --> 36:26.818
FOR WHEN YOU'RE
ON THE GO.

36:26.852 --> 36:30.322
- AT LEAST I'M NOT BLEEDING.

36:30.356 --> 36:32.291
OH, GOD. HOW COULD
I HAVE DONE THAT?

36:32.324 --> 36:33.825
- IF YOU HADN'T,
I WOULD'VE.

36:33.859 --> 36:35.427
- I WAS COMPLETELY
OUT OF CONTROL.

36:35.461 --> 36:37.429
I'VE NEVER BEEN COMPLETELY
OUT OF CONTROL.

36:37.463 --> 36:38.964
- YOU SHOULD TRY IT MORE OFTEN.

36:38.997 --> 36:40.566
WHO KNOWS, I MIGHT
LIKE YOU BETTER.

36:40.599 --> 36:42.334
- NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHAT I DID,

36:42.368 --> 36:43.869
IT GOES AGAINST EVERYTHING
I BELIEVE IN.

36:43.902 --> 36:47.573
EVERYTHING I TELL MY STUDENTS.

36:47.606 --> 36:50.376
IT MAKES ME NO DIFFERENT
THAN THOSE MONSTERS.

36:50.409 --> 36:51.910
- [exhales]

36:51.943 --> 36:55.347
DOES THAT MEAN I CAN'T CALL YOU
"ZEN BEN" ANY MORE?

36:55.381 --> 36:57.849
- YOU CALL ME "ZEN BEN"?

36:57.883 --> 37:02.488
- [chuckles]
YEAH.

37:17.636 --> 37:22.908
YOU KNOW, GANDHI
WAS A MARLBORO MAN.

37:22.941 --> 37:25.877
- YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
A TERRIBLE INFLUENCE.

37:25.911 --> 37:28.647
- I TRY MY BEST.

37:33.852 --> 37:35.487
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE BUDDHA WOULD SAY.

37:35.521 --> 37:37.956
WE HAVEN'T TALKED
FOR A WHILE BUT...

37:37.989 --> 37:41.259
I DO KNOW THAT YOUR HUSBAND
WOULD BE DAMN PROUD OF YOU.

37:46.832 --> 37:51.770
- WELL, IF ANYONE
KNOWS MICHAEL...YOU DO.

37:51.803 --> 37:55.040
- DID.

37:55.073 --> 37:58.810
- IF HE KNEW YOU WERE
AT THAT HOSPITAL...

37:58.844 --> 38:00.579
THAT YOU NEARLY TOOK
THAT DOCTOR'S HEAD OFF

38:00.612 --> 38:01.647
BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T
TAKE YOUR BLOOD, HE WOULD--

38:01.680 --> 38:03.382
LISTEN, PROFESSOR,

38:03.415 --> 38:08.854
MRS. NOVOTNY-BRUCKNER
MADE IT QUITE CLEAR.

38:08.887 --> 38:11.423
"JUST BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS
FOR OUR WHOLE LIVES

38:11.457 --> 38:14.726
IS NO REASON TO GO ON
BEING FRIENDS."

38:19.431 --> 38:22.368
- THANK YOU.
- THANKS.

38:24.570 --> 38:26.572
- WHAT THE HELL IS
THIS SUPPOSED TO BE?

38:26.605 --> 38:28.807
- I'M NOT SURE, BUT I MAKE IT
A GENERAL RULE

38:28.840 --> 38:30.676
NOT TO EAT ANYTHING
THAT'S STILL MOVING.

38:30.709 --> 38:35.414
- HOW CAN YOU
FUCK UP JELL-O?

38:35.447 --> 38:37.549
- SO WHEN'S MICHAEL GOING HOME?
- I DON'T KNOW.

38:37.583 --> 38:39.418
THE DOCTOR'S GOING
TO TALK TO US LATER.

38:39.451 --> 38:41.587
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
TWO DAYS? A WEEK?

38:41.620 --> 38:44.356
WHAT'S YOUR HURRY?
YOU GOT A PLANE TO CATCH?

38:44.390 --> 38:48.427
- THAT'S $5.50 PLEASE.

38:48.460 --> 38:51.430
- YOU DO HAVE
A PLANE TO...

38:51.463 --> 38:54.433
WHAT'S THE MATTER, SNOW WHITE
CAN'T MAKE DO WITH SIX DWARFS?

38:54.466 --> 38:55.967
- I CAN PAY FOR MYSELF.

38:56.001 --> 38:58.437
- SORRY. IT'S GRANDMOTHER'S
RIGHTS. FOR BOTH.

38:58.470 --> 39:00.839
- $10.50.
- THANKS.

39:00.872 --> 39:02.641
- I DIDN'T HEAR YOU.

39:02.674 --> 39:06.612
- THANK YOU.
- BETTER.

39:11.817 --> 39:15.521
SO, LET ME ASK
YOU SOMETHING.

39:15.554 --> 39:17.389
IF YOU KNEW THAT YOU WERE GOING
TO JUST TURN AROUND

39:17.423 --> 39:19.925
AND TAKE OFF AGAIN...

39:19.958 --> 39:21.760
WHY THE HELL DID
YOU EVEN COME BACK?

39:21.793 --> 39:25.063
- I WANTED TO MAKE
SURE HE WAS OKAY.

39:25.096 --> 39:29.468
- YEAH? THEY GOT PHONES
FOR THAT, E-MAIL.

39:29.501 --> 39:34.406
EW. OH, IS THAT WHAT
THEY CALL MEAT SAUCE?

39:34.440 --> 39:37.609
[dish clatters]

39:37.643 --> 39:39.077
NO, THERE'S GOT TO
BE SOME OTHER REASON

39:39.110 --> 39:42.147
THAT YOU JOURNEYED ALL THE WAY
FROM THE MAGIC KINGDOM.

39:42.180 --> 39:46.518
- I TOLD YOU.

39:46.552 --> 39:48.520
- THEN MAYBE IT
WOULD'VE BEEN BETTER

39:48.554 --> 39:52.524
IF YOU HADN'T
COME BACK AT ALL.

39:52.558 --> 39:53.925
YOU SEE, THEY WERE JUST
BEGINNING TO ACCEPT

39:53.959 --> 39:56.127
THE FACT
THAT YOU'RE GONE.

40:00.566 --> 40:04.836
- MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

40:08.940 --> 40:11.810
- I'M NOT ALWAYS RIGHT.

40:11.843 --> 40:15.847
IN FACT, SOMETIMES
I'M DEAD WRONG.

40:15.881 --> 40:20.085
BUT I'M THINKING THAT
MAYBE YOU CAME BACK...

40:20.118 --> 40:23.154
BECAUSE YOU MISS THEM
AS MUCH AS THEY MISS YOU.

40:25.824 --> 40:31.530
AND MAYBE YOU WERE EVEN HOPING
THAT IF YOU CAME BACK...

40:31.563 --> 40:33.999
THEY MIGHT ASK YOU TO STAY.

40:43.842 --> 40:48.213
LET ME HAVE A TASTE OF
THAT MAC AND CHEESE.

40:48.246 --> 40:52.718
JESUS.

40:52.751 --> 40:55.821
- WHERE DID YOU
LEARN HOW TO RUN?

40:55.854 --> 40:57.856
- MARILYN MONROE,
SOME LIKE IT HOT.

40:57.889 --> 40:59.691
YOU KNOW,
THE PIER SCENE.

40:59.725 --> 41:01.560
"WAIT FOR SUGAR!"

41:01.593 --> 41:04.763
- COULDN'T YOU PRETEND TO BE
DE NIRO, OR SCHWARZENEGGER

41:04.796 --> 41:06.231
IN THAT MOVIE WHERE HE WAS
RUNNING ALL THE TIME?

41:06.264 --> 41:07.866
SOMEHOW, I MISSED THAT ONE.

41:07.899 --> 41:10.702
AND THERE ARE LIMITS
TO THE HUMAN IMAGINATION.

41:10.736 --> 41:13.639
BESIDES, I DON'T HAVE TO PRETEND
I'M A MOVIE HERO TODAY

41:13.672 --> 41:16.007
BECAUSE TODAY
I AM A REAL ONE.

41:16.041 --> 41:18.176
[laughs]
LOOK AT THAT, HUH?

41:18.209 --> 41:19.911
IS THAT NOT A
THING OF BEAUTY?

41:19.945 --> 41:22.714
UNH! I REALLY GAVE IT
TO THAT FUCKER, DIDN'T I?

41:22.748 --> 41:25.884
- YEAH, I'D SAY YOU
PACKED QUITE A PUNCH.

41:25.917 --> 41:27.519
- I WON'T BORE YOU
WITH THE DETAILS

41:27.553 --> 41:29.020
OF THE TIME
BACK IN HAZELHURST

41:29.054 --> 41:31.723
MY DADDY TRIED TO TEACH
ME HOW TO BOX, BUT...

41:31.757 --> 41:34.626
LET'S JUST SAY IF I'D LEARNED
HOW TO DEFEND MYSELF

41:34.660 --> 41:36.662
THAT BRIGHT SUMMER DAY,

41:36.695 --> 41:38.630
WHO KNOWS HOW DIFFERENT
MY LIFE MIGHT HAVE BEEN?

41:38.664 --> 41:41.266
WELL, NOW YOU KNOW.

41:41.299 --> 41:43.001
WHO'D HAVE EVER GUESSED
YOU COULD USE A FIST

41:43.034 --> 41:45.070
FOR SOMETHING ELSE?
[laughing]

41:49.174 --> 41:51.543
- I TOLD MARIE I'D
GO BACK TO THE HOUSE

41:51.577 --> 41:54.646
AFTER DINNER, HELP OUT.

41:54.680 --> 41:57.916
- I'LL STAY WITH THE KIDS.

41:57.949 --> 42:00.051
- IT BROKE MY HEART TO SEE
MADDIE JUST STANDING THERE

42:00.085 --> 42:06.692
AT DUSTY'S GRAVE
HOLDING THAT FLOWER.

42:06.725 --> 42:10.896
ONLY TWO, AND SHE'S LOST
ONE OF HER MOMMIES.

42:10.929 --> 42:14.299
- AND NEXT WEEK'S
KELLY'S BIRTHDAY.

42:14.332 --> 42:18.804
THEY WERE
PLANNING A PARTY.

42:18.837 --> 42:21.306
- YOU DON'T REALLY THINK
THEY COULD

42:21.339 --> 42:23.842
TAKE THOSE KIDS AWAY
FROM HER, DO YOU?

42:23.875 --> 42:28.246
- I DON'T KNOW.

42:28.279 --> 42:30.048
LINZ...

42:30.081 --> 42:33.051
OH, NEVER MIND.

42:33.084 --> 42:34.185
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT LATER.

42:34.219 --> 42:37.623
NO, TELL ME.

42:40.726 --> 42:43.194
- WHEN THE MINISTER SAID
IT WAS TIME FOR US

42:43.228 --> 42:45.196
TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO DUSTY,

42:45.230 --> 42:48.066
I FELT LIKE I WAS
SAYING GOOD-BYE

42:48.099 --> 42:50.335
TO SOMETHING ELSE AS WELL.

42:50.368 --> 42:53.104
- LIKE WHAT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

42:53.138 --> 42:57.075
A BELIEF, AN ASSUMPTION

42:57.108 --> 43:00.211
THAT WITH A LITTLE HOPE
AND A LOT OF HARD WORK,

43:00.245 --> 43:06.718
THINGS WILL SOMEHOW
WORK OUT FOR THE BEST.

43:06.752 --> 43:11.823
I'M NOT SURE
I BELIEVE THAT ANYMORE.

43:11.857 --> 43:16.327
- YOU HAVE TO, MEL.
THAT'S EVERYTHING.

43:20.398 --> 43:23.401
- ALL I KNOW IS, WE HAVE
A FAMILY TO LOOK OUT FOR.

43:23.434 --> 43:25.837
WHAT IF SOMETHING WERE TO HAPPEN
TO ONE OF US,

43:25.871 --> 43:27.005
OR GOD FORBID,
TO GUS OR JENNY?

43:27.038 --> 43:28.740
- PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT.

43:28.774 --> 43:31.409
- YEAH? HOW CAN I NOT?
IT'S WHAT I'M THINKING.

43:31.442 --> 43:36.247
ISN'T IT WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING?

43:36.281 --> 43:39.184
- LOOK, IT WAS
JUST ONE INCIDENT.

43:39.217 --> 43:41.052
ONE CRAZY PERSON.

43:41.086 --> 43:44.255
- I-I DEARLY WISH THAT
I COULD BELIEVE THAT.

43:44.289 --> 43:46.157
THAT THIS KIND OF THING
WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

43:46.191 --> 43:48.994
BUT MY GRANDFATHER
KNEW THAT WASN'T TRUE.

43:49.027 --> 43:50.395
THAT'S WHY HE LEFT
AND CAME HERE.

43:50.428 --> 43:51.797
AND I KNOW IT TOO.

43:51.830 --> 43:53.999
- ARE YOU SAYING
YOU WANT TO LEAVE?

43:54.032 --> 43:57.803
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING.

43:57.836 --> 44:00.739
OH, GOD.

44:00.772 --> 44:04.042
I PROBABLY SOUND LIKE
A PARANOID, AN ALARMIST.

44:04.075 --> 44:08.179
- YOU'RE JUST AFRAID...
AND WITH GOOD REASON.

44:14.720 --> 44:19.791
- YOU KNOW, I USED TO HATE IT
WHEN BRIAN WOULD SAY,

44:19.825 --> 44:22.060
"THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF
STRAIGHT PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD:

44:22.093 --> 44:23.762
"THE ONES WHO HATE
YOU TO YOUR FACE,

44:23.795 --> 44:25.697
AND THE ONES WHO HATE YOU
BEHIND YOUR BACK,"

44:25.731 --> 44:27.332
BECAUSE I KNEW
THAT WASN'T TRUE.

44:27.365 --> 44:29.835
THERE ARE PLENTY OF STRAIGHT
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HATE US.

44:29.868 --> 44:32.170
BUT THE ONES WHO DO NO LONGER
HAVE TO DO IT BEHIND OUR BACKS.

44:32.203 --> 44:33.972
THEY CAN DO IT
IN THE WHITE HOUSE,

44:34.005 --> 44:37.242
IN CHURCHES, ON TELEVISION,
IN THE STREETS.

44:41.246 --> 44:44.983
IS THAT THE KIND OF PLACE
WE WANT TO LIVE?

44:50.856 --> 44:53.759
IS THAT THE KIND OF PLACE
WE WANT TO RAISE OUR KIDS?

45:06.872 --> 45:09.107
- HMM, IT'S HEALING
VERY WELL.

45:09.140 --> 45:10.942
- THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

45:10.976 --> 45:12.077
- CONSIDERING THE SHAPE
YOU WERE IN

45:12.110 --> 45:13.344
WHEN THEY
BROUGHT YOU HERE,

45:13.378 --> 45:15.280
I'D SAY YOU'RE
A LUCKY MAN.

45:15.313 --> 45:16.948
- WOO-HOO.

45:16.982 --> 45:21.352
- UM, SOME INTERESTED PARTIES
WOULD LIKE TO KNOW

45:21.386 --> 45:24.022
WHEN I CAN GO HOME.

45:24.055 --> 45:25.123
- WE'LL KEEP YOU A
COUPLE OF MORE DAYS,

45:25.156 --> 45:26.825
THEN SEND YOU
ON YOUR WAY.

45:26.858 --> 45:28.827
- I'M SURE THEY'LL BE
GLAD TO HEAR THAT.

45:28.860 --> 45:31.129
- I EXPECT YOU
TO TAKE IT EASY.

45:31.162 --> 45:33.999
DON'T OVERDO.

45:34.032 --> 45:37.135
- I HEARD EVERY WORD!
- I KNOW.

45:37.168 --> 45:40.538
YEARS OF PRACTICE LISTENING IN
ON MY BEDROOM DOOR.

45:40.571 --> 45:42.373
- I'M GLAD MY SUPERHERO'S
COMING HOME.

45:42.407 --> 45:46.144
- ME, TOO.
- BUT YOU HEARD THE DOCTOR.

45:46.177 --> 45:49.881
YOU HAVE TO REST.
- I'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM.

45:51.416 --> 45:55.453
- DOES THIS MEAN NO MORE
GANGBANGS WITH THE DWARFS?

45:55.486 --> 45:58.156
- WHAT WAS THAT?

45:58.189 --> 46:00.125
- I-I WAS WONDERING...

46:00.158 --> 46:01.793
THAT IS, IF IT'S
ALL RIGHT WITH YOU,

46:01.827 --> 46:06.031
IF...MAYBE...
I COULD COME HOME?

46:06.064 --> 46:11.002
- UH...

46:11.036 --> 46:14.072
I-I THINK THAT
WOULD BE FINE WITH US.

46:14.105 --> 46:17.275
- THAT'S GOOD, BECAUSE WITH YOU
PUNCHING PEOPLE OUT,

46:17.308 --> 46:18.877
AND YOU GETTING
BLOWN UP,

46:18.910 --> 46:20.946
SOMEBODY REALLY NEEDS
TO KEEP AN EYE ON YOU.

46:20.979 --> 46:22.147
- ANYBODY HOME?
- WHOA.

46:22.180 --> 46:23.915
- HEY, TEDDY.
- HEY.

46:23.949 --> 46:26.051
- HEY.
- HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?

46:26.084 --> 46:28.453
- GOING GOOD.
- WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?

46:28.486 --> 46:30.188
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

46:30.221 --> 46:34.292
WE'RE JUST SO
GLAD TO SEE YOU.

46:34.325 --> 46:37.395
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW GLAD I AM TO SEE YOU.

46:41.499 --> 46:44.069
- OH.

46:44.102 --> 46:46.571
- SO WHAT'S NEW
IN THE WORLD?

46:46.604 --> 46:50.575
- OH, UH, LET'S SEE.
UH, WELL, UH...

46:50.608 --> 46:53.044
CHER CELEBRATED
HER 75th BIRTHDAY.

46:53.078 --> 46:55.513
AND, UH, WHAT ELSE?

46:55.546 --> 46:57.048
OH, UH, THEY'RE DOING
A NEW PRODUCTION

46:57.082 --> 46:58.850
OF STREETCAR
DOWN IN NEW YORK.

46:58.884 --> 47:00.318
NATASHA RICHARDSON'S,
SHE'S GOING TO PLAY BLANCHE,

47:00.351 --> 47:02.921
AND, UH, LIZ SMITH IS
GOING TO PLAY STANLEY.

47:02.954 --> 47:04.890
WHICH IS GREAT.

NOW THAT I'M BEHIND IT...

49:10.415 --> 49:14.719

49:21.626 --> 49:25.130
- AND WHAT IS THAT
ONE GOOD REASON?

49:25.163 --> 49:32.337

I LOVE HOW MUCH I LOVE HIM.
