00:02.200 --> 00:03.929
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

00:04.440 --> 00:05.771
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

00:06.000 --> 00:09.447
<i>I returned home with only
one goal, to save my city.</i>

00:09.920 --> 00:11.604
<i>But my old approach wasn't enough.</i>

00:11.760 --> 00:13.524
<i>I had to become someone else.</i>

00:13.920 --> 00:16.126
<i>I had to become something else.</i>

00:16.760 --> 00:19.127
<i>I had to become the Green Arrow.</i>

00:19.920 --> 00:21.410
Previously on Arrow...

00:21.600 --> 00:23.887
<i>So, when 're you gonna pop the question?</i>

00:24.120 --> 00:25.360
<i>O LIVE RI Tonight.</i>

00:25.960 --> 00:27.769
This is a map of Lian Yu.

00:27.960 --> 00:30.884
And I think that it leads to
whatever Reiter is looking for.

00:31.080 --> 00:32.127
To get there I'll need your help.

00:32.280 --> 00:35.090
The restoration of Starling Bay.
Leave the Bay as it is.

00:35.360 --> 00:36.441
What if I refuse?

00:36.720 --> 00:39.291
The fight to save Star City isn't
gonna be fought in the shadows.

00:39.440 --> 00:40.771
It's gonna be fought in the light of day.

00:40.960 --> 00:41.961
And I promise you,

00:42.120 --> 00:44.487
that I will never stop fighting
to save this city.

00:44.800 --> 00:46.928
<i>There was a time
I would've thought this was my fault.</i>

00:47.120 --> 00:49.487
<i>It's not my fault. It's my responsibility.</i>

00:59.280 --> 01:00.486
<i>Ollie?</i>

01:00.960 --> 01:02.405
Hey. How we doing?

01:02.760 --> 01:05.001
It's actually a pretty great turnout.

01:05.319 --> 01:06.970
<i>Who knew people would
rather pick up garbage</i>

01:07.160 --> 01:08.286
than celebrate the holidays, huh?

01:08.480 --> 01:10.721
Not bad for a hippie-crunchy
campaign proposal, huh?

01:10.960 --> 01:12.450
Nobody likes an "I told you so."

01:12.640 --> 01:15.405
Except apparently Star City.
Your approval rating is up 10 points.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.847
- I have an approval rating.
- Yes. Yes, you do.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.604
Welcome to politics, Mr. Queen.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.321
- Mr. Queen.
- Yes! Excuse Me.

01:23.280 --> 01:26.284
How do you feel about inspiring
so many people to come out here today?

01:26.680 --> 01:28.330
Oh... I didn't inspire anyone.

01:28.600 --> 01:31.171
This is the city that I know,
it's the city I remembered,

01:31.360 --> 01:34.011
- and it's the city that we can be again.
- Nice. Thank you for your time.

01:34.280 --> 01:36.009
- Thank you.
- Nice line.

01:36.320 --> 01:37.685
Did you give him that one?

01:38.200 --> 01:39.611
I might've given a note or two.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.490
<i>Well,
you have people picking up garbage</i>

01:41.680 --> 01:42.920
when they should be picking up presents.

01:43.360 --> 01:45.681
<i>- You missed your calling.
- How are you doing?</i>

01:46.040 --> 01:47.963
I have my brother home with me
for the holidays, Oliver.

01:48.960 --> 01:50.200
He's in a cage...

01:50.680 --> 01:51.841
But he's here.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.128
We're gonna get Andy out
from under Darhk's influence, John.

01:55.520 --> 01:57.010
That is a promise.

01:57.880 --> 02:00.884
If we can reduce just 40%
of the toxicity that's produced

02:01.160 --> 02:03.731
by the bacterial microorganisms
that have just sprung up here...

02:03.880 --> 02:05.291
We can swim in just 12 more days

02:05.520 --> 02:08.000
- if the restitution rate stays consistent.
- Yes.

02:08.280 --> 02:11.124
- She's like a mini-you. That's so cute.
- That's awesome.

02:13.720 --> 02:15.006
Everybody get down!

02:16.720 --> 02:18.643
Go! Go! Go! Go! Take cover!

02:19.680 --> 02:21.330
Let's go! Let's go! Get down!

02:24.080 --> 02:25.889
I think I can power
the drones down remotely!

02:26.200 --> 02:27.406
I think now would be a good time for that.

02:27.560 --> 02:28.846
GO! Go!

02:32.400 --> 02:33.640
Hurry!

02:34.920 --> 02:37.571
Hurry up! Everybody get down!

02:47.880 --> 02:49.086
You all right?

03:03.280 --> 03:07.285
<i>A day of hope for a better tomorrow
has turned into another day of despair</i>

03:07.560 --> 03:08.607
<i>for Star City.</i>

03:08.760 --> 03:11.969
<i>A terrorist attack has left
dozens in critical condition</i>

03:12.120 --> 03:14.122
<i>after people showed up
to help Oliver Queen</i>

03:14.280 --> 03:16.806
<i>and his campaign staff
clean up the Star City Bay.</i>

03:17.200 --> 03:20.090
<i>In the meantime, SCPD
and national authorities</i>

03:20.280 --> 03:22.362
<i>are searching for
the individuals responsible,</i>

03:22.560 --> 03:24.801
<i>but so far, there are no suspects.</i>

03:26.920 --> 03:28.126
Any news on the victims?

03:28.440 --> 03:30.488
Some are being released.
Some are still in surgery.

03:30.640 --> 03:33.484
- It's a miracle that no one died.
- Despite Darhk's best efforts.

03:33.760 --> 03:35.728
Are we sure that this was HIVE?

03:37.440 --> 03:39.124
Yeah, that's what I thought.

03:40.920 --> 03:43.241
- Are you okay?
- There were kids there.

03:43.480 --> 03:45.448
It's Alex.

03:45.640 --> 03:47.608
He's saying that every
news network in the country

03:47.800 --> 03:50.167
- is looking for a comment from you.
- No comment.

03:51.160 --> 03:54.164
- Ollie, we have to give them something.
- What do you want me to say?

03:54.640 --> 03:57.007
I asked people to come and help,
they almost died because of it.

03:57.240 --> 04:02.167
It's when we have a plan to get Darhk,
then I will talk to the press.

04:02.840 --> 04:06.811
I know HIVE wants this city to die
but going after a volunteer event,

04:07.000 --> 04:09.321
ltjust seems a little overkill.

04:09.600 --> 04:12.604
Two weeks ago, Darhk told me
to back off my plan to clean up the Bay.

04:12.840 --> 04:13.966
Today, he went after civilians.

04:14.160 --> 04:18.688
This is important to him for some reason.
We need to understand what it is.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.128
Last time I tried to talk to my brother
it didn't go too well.

04:22.360 --> 04:23.691
Try to talk to him again.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.608
A couple of weeks in a cage
will change your perspective. Trust me.

04:32.040 --> 04:34.168
All right. Almost there.
Maybe two more miles.

04:34.520 --> 04:36.682
Since when does two more miles
mean almost there?

04:36.880 --> 04:39.451
- Taiana, we need to push forward.
- No.

04:39.960 --> 04:41.166
That's what you want.

04:41.360 --> 04:43.727
My brother's dead and
you have me marching to the sea.

04:43.880 --> 04:45.041
I thought you wanted to
get back at Reiter.

04:45.280 --> 04:47.362
I want to kill the bastards
who killed my brother.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.363
Conklin is just an extension of Reiter.

04:51.560 --> 04:53.881
You want to hurt them,
you keep them from getting what they want.

04:54.360 --> 04:56.840
Your idea of revenge
is a bit more indirect than mine.

04:57.040 --> 05:00.010
You're right. I'm using you.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.562
You said you were a dive instructor.
I need those skills.

05:02.800 --> 05:05.406
But I'm promising you,
if I get what I want,

05:05.840 --> 05:08.161
Reiter and Conklin will suffer.

05:09.320 --> 05:10.731
What would Vlad want you to do?

05:19.240 --> 05:21.004
My friends seem to think
you're ready to talk,

05:21.560 --> 05:22.846
but I know better.

05:25.840 --> 05:28.207
You were always
one stubborn son of a bitch.

05:30.880 --> 05:34.248
Pictures of Carly and Andy Junior.

05:35.080 --> 05:37.890
A real man would've asked for them by now.

05:40.920 --> 05:43.890
You know Carly cried for months
because she thought you were killed?

05:44.200 --> 05:46.726
Andy Junior grew up without a father.

05:47.920 --> 05:51.527
- And you let them.
- It wasn't me, it was HIVE.

05:52.200 --> 05:54.043
They fake our deaths so we're untraceable.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.762
Floyd Lawton shot me
with ammo supplied by HIVE.

05:56.960 --> 05:58.121
He didn't even know.

05:58.360 --> 05:59.964
You destroyed your family, Andy!

06:00.240 --> 06:03.130
<i>And you never reached out to them.
Not even once.</i>

06:03.600 --> 06:05.045
How could you do that?

06:06.280 --> 06:09.602
<i>I get it.
You didn't care then, you don't care now.</i>

06:12.520 --> 06:16.081
Just so you know,
your good friend, Damien Darhk,

06:16.400 --> 06:18.243
attacked the Star City Bay this morning.

06:18.480 --> 06:20.130
Hurt a whole lot of people.

06:20.920 --> 06:23.605
And the neuro-blockers he was using on you
were no longer in your system.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.804
So, chemically speaking, Andy,
you're no longer his bitch.

06:27.080 --> 06:30.801
I'm not anyone's bitch. And I'm not yours.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.445
<i>What happened to you, Andy?</i>

06:35.120 --> 06:39.569
If Damien Darhk brainwashed you,
I could get it.

06:40.920 --> 06:42.331
But according to Darhk...

06:43.560 --> 06:45.722
Were you running drugs
and weapons in the 'Stan?

06:46.920 --> 06:48.331
I had to do what I had to do.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.085
I'm giving you a chance here, man.

06:51.840 --> 06:54.491
A chance, Andy, to redeem yourself
for all that you've done.

06:55.240 --> 06:57.322
'Cause I have to believe that
someplace deep inside of you,

06:57.520 --> 06:59.010
you want to make the right choice.

06:59.840 --> 07:03.367
So I'm asking whatever's left
of the brother I loved,

07:03.840 --> 07:06.366
the one I still love, Andy,
one last time, man.

07:07.280 --> 07:08.930
What does Darhk want with the Bay?

07:11.280 --> 07:12.520
I don't know.

07:19.040 --> 07:20.690
Hey, Mom.

07:20.840 --> 07:24.287
- Thank God you're okay, baby.
- Yeah, I'm okay. I'm fine.

07:24.480 --> 07:25.527
Oh...

07:25.680 --> 07:27.364
It's so awful. It's just, like...

07:27.800 --> 07:30.121
Who shoots up a bunch of people
during the holidays?

07:30.440 --> 07:32.124
That's what makes it awful?

07:33.640 --> 07:35.290
Why does it look like
Santa Claus threw up in here?

07:35.480 --> 07:38.131
It's for Oliver's campaign holiday party.

07:38.640 --> 07:42.281
I wanted to make sure your
Jewish heritage was represented.

07:42.560 --> 07:44.289
Yeah, I'm not so sure
that's still gonna be happening.

07:44.520 --> 07:46.522
What? Humbug. No, no, no.

07:46.960 --> 07:50.043
That's ridiculous, sweetie. No.
You can't let the terrorists win.

07:50.560 --> 07:52.847
- I'm gonna take a shower.
- Okay.

07:56.640 --> 07:59.325
Mom? Mom? Are you okay?
Are you okay? Are you okay?

08:00.320 --> 08:01.401
- In the Christmas lights...
- Uh-huh.

08:01.560 --> 08:02.846
In a ring box I found...

08:03.680 --> 08:04.920
I found this.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.571
Three carats. Princess cut.
No cloudiness at all.

08:08.880 --> 08:11.850
I knew Oliver loved you,
but not this much.

08:12.640 --> 08:14.688
He's gonna propose.

08:14.880 --> 08:17.690
He's gonna propose. Oh, my gosh!

08:17.920 --> 08:20.002
Honey, I don't know who's more excited,
you or me.

08:20.240 --> 08:22.083
I think it's me.

08:33.720 --> 08:35.085
Thanks for coming.

08:36.360 --> 08:38.522
I'm trying to figure out
how to deal with them.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.602
I sort of think our best bet
is telling the truth.

08:42.120 --> 08:43.201
It's the only play we got, man.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.209
<i>The HIVE has us outnumbered.</i>

08:45.520 --> 08:48.922
If we have any chance of stopping Darhk,
we need to ask the city for help.

08:49.120 --> 08:52.681
If we do this, it is gonna
paint a target on all of our backs.

08:52.920 --> 08:55.127
- We can take care of ourselves
- Let's light 'em up.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.648
Thank you for coming, everyone. Thank you.

09:07.040 --> 09:09.884
As today's tragedy has reminded us,
we are at war.

09:10.760 --> 09:13.081
For six months, we have been besieged

09:13.560 --> 09:17.167
by a nameless, and a faceless organization

09:17.400 --> 09:19.767
that seems hell-bent
on destroying our city.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.166
You know them as the Ghosts.

09:21.400 --> 09:24.244
And while they may be anonymous,
their leader is not.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.802
He has a face. He has a name,
and I think that it is high time

09:28.080 --> 09:31.402
the people of Star City
know the truth about who he is.

09:34.320 --> 09:35.845
His name is Damien Darhk.

09:36.440 --> 09:39.808
He controls the Ghosts on behalf
of an organization known as HIVE.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.651
HIVE wants this city to die.

09:42.840 --> 09:46.322
Now I will be distributing this,
the only known photograph of Mr. Darhk,

09:46.600 --> 09:49.080
to every news outlet and
social media feed in the country.

09:49.320 --> 09:53.370
<i>For months, this man
has made us afraid to walk the streets.</i>

09:53.600 --> 09:55.364
<i>I suggest that we return the favor.</i>

09:55.680 --> 09:57.523
<i>We will also be setting up a hotline.</i>

09:57.680 --> 10:00.331
<i>Now, individually,
Mr. Darhk may be able to defeat us.</i>

10:00.600 --> 10:01.681
<i>But united...</i>

10:03.440 --> 10:04.771
<i>He doesn't stand a chance.</i>

10:07.480 --> 10:10.450
Congratulations, Damien. You're famous.

10:20.840 --> 10:23.127
Well, that should get
his attention at the very least.

10:23.480 --> 10:25.130
- You good with the hotline?
- I'm on it.

10:26.680 --> 10:29.524
- Happy hunting.
- That is a whole lot of Hanukkah.

10:29.720 --> 10:31.961
Yeah. For your campaign holiday party.

10:32.200 --> 10:35.044
You better believe that my faith is
going to be well-represented.

10:35.320 --> 10:38.802
Felicity, we just waved
a red flag in front of a bull.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.729
That doesn't mean the bull
is gonna charge right away.

10:40.880 --> 10:43.804
And it doesn't mean we can put
our entire lives on hold in the meantime.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.245
- But... Help me out here, man.
- No can do.

10:47.400 --> 10:49.528
- Can't throw a grenade then go to ground.
- John is right.

10:49.800 --> 10:52.326
As much as your speech
was about outing Darhk,

10:52.520 --> 10:55.330
it was also about sending the message
that you're not afraid anymore.

10:55.640 --> 10:58.325
- And canceling your Christmas party...
- Holiday. Holiday.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.050
Your holiday party

11:01.040 --> 11:02.769
is sending the opposite message.

11:05.840 --> 11:08.730
Okay. Talk to Lance,
see if he can get some extra security

11:09.040 --> 11:10.849
<i>- for this holiday party.</i>
- Yes.

11:21.240 --> 11:22.730
Could I ask you a question?

11:23.440 --> 11:25.283
Now? Here? I mean...

11:27.240 --> 11:28.446
What's the question?

11:29.880 --> 11:31.291
Did we do the right thing?

11:33.240 --> 11:34.446
You mean with Darhk?

11:35.280 --> 11:38.568
Yeah. Well, he's gonna retaliate.

11:39.040 --> 11:41.361
Somewhere. Some place and...

11:41.880 --> 11:44.087
When he does, we'll be ready.

11:48.120 --> 11:50.407
I think the drugs Reiter has
you and the other captives growing

11:50.640 --> 11:51.971
is just funding his bigger plan,

11:52.120 --> 11:54.202
searching for some sort of
mystical artifact.

11:54.600 --> 11:57.570
- He likes his prayers and trinkets.
- And maps.

11:58.200 --> 12:01.044
But I cannot make that one without
detailed survey maps of the island.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.123
- Reiter doesn't have them?
- Not that I've seen.

12:03.320 --> 12:06.483
But Reiter is not the first person to come
to this island while I've been here.

12:13.240 --> 12:15.004
If you're here to give me
a Christmas present

12:15.160 --> 12:19.563
you can keep whatever knife
or torture device you plan on giving me.

12:19.800 --> 12:22.246
No presents.
Nothing gift-wrapped, at any rate.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.404
I just wanted to check
and see how you're feeling.

12:26.840 --> 12:29.411
I'm great.
Haven't wanted to snap anybody's neck

12:29.640 --> 12:32.962
who's given me the wrong look
since Damien Darhk whammied me.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.248
I think I might be cured, Dad.

12:37.080 --> 12:40.801
So, you can keep whatever file
you have on a pedophile,

12:41.000 --> 12:43.367
or meter maid, or politician,

12:43.600 --> 12:46.285
whoever it is
that you think I'm gonna kill.

12:46.680 --> 12:49.126
Since you told me about
your encounter with Damien Darhk,

12:49.360 --> 12:52.523
- I had my minions looking into it.
- You love having minions.

12:52.760 --> 12:55.286
Darhk's effect on you
had nothing to do with his exposure

12:55.520 --> 12:56.681
to waters from the Lazarus Pit.

12:56.960 --> 12:59.042
Then why do you think
he's affecting my bloodlust?

12:59.200 --> 13:02.363
I don't know. There are very few things
in this world that scare me, Thea.

13:02.680 --> 13:04.967
But I'm beginning to suspect
we're dealing with something

13:05.160 --> 13:07.731
- that might fall into that category.
- Just cheer up, Dad.

13:08.160 --> 13:09.730
Okay? It's Christmas.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.890
We are dealing with universal forces
that I don't understand yet.

13:13.120 --> 13:15.122
Please, promise me
that you will be careful.

13:16.200 --> 13:17.645
I pinky promise.

13:32.640 --> 13:34.005
You look good.

13:37.080 --> 13:38.923
You were not kidding
about the extra security.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.646
- Where did you find all these guys?
- Well, a friend of mine is a SEAL.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.490
He knows someone, who knew someone,
who knew someone.

13:43.760 --> 13:45.728
Really big somebodies.
These guys are like three of me.

13:45.920 --> 13:46.921
Yeah. Where's Laurel?

13:47.080 --> 13:48.889
Probably fielding
a million calls on the hotline.

13:49.080 --> 13:50.241
She must love you right now.

13:50.400 --> 13:54.325
Is it just me or did you hire
the U.S. Army as your caterers?

13:54.600 --> 13:55.726
Actually, they're marines.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.888
I am John Diggle.
I work security for Mr. Queen.

13:58.080 --> 14:00.162
Curtis Holt,
I work for Mr. Queen's girlfriend.

14:00.400 --> 14:03.006
- This is my husband, Paul.
- A hottie. Nice work, Curtis.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.284
- What? Was? Wait, was that weird?
- A little.

14:06.520 --> 14:09.000
Don't worry. You're handsome,
duh, but you bat for the other team.

14:09.240 --> 14:10.287
And I'm practically engaged.

14:10.440 --> 14:14.047
And, by practically engaged,
I mean not engaged at all. Right?

14:14.280 --> 14:18.251
I mean anything could happen eventually
in, like, years. In another galaxy.

14:18.600 --> 14:21.365
Excuse me. Can I steal you for a second?
The fire department chief's here.

14:22.760 --> 14:24.046
- Very nice to meet you.
- You too.

14:24.240 --> 14:25.605
- Curtis.
- Oliver.

14:26.880 --> 14:29.724
- How long have you two been married?
- Five years, right about now.

14:29.960 --> 14:32.361
Oh, winter wedding.
That must've been beautiful.

14:32.640 --> 14:33.801
It was the summer, actually.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.451
We got married on a scuba-diving boat

14:35.640 --> 14:36.721
- near the Great Barrier Reef.
- Whoa...

14:36.880 --> 14:39.042
I hid the ring in a seashell
at the bottom of the reef.

14:39.280 --> 14:40.486
And you are lucky I found it.

14:40.640 --> 14:42.802
Well, you never would've found it
if I'd put it in a dessert

14:43.040 --> 14:44.121
<i>like straight people do.</i>

14:44.400 --> 14:47.324
Have you seen him eat a piece of cake?
He doesn't chew, he inhales.

14:47.720 --> 14:48.960
Soufflé.

14:49.920 --> 14:52.810
- Felicity? Are you okay?
- Yeah. Just got to find my mom.

15:00.080 --> 15:01.923
Oh, my gosh! No, it was awesome.

15:02.760 --> 15:03.841
- Mom?
- Oh.

15:05.480 --> 15:06.561
Uh... Hmm.

15:06.720 --> 15:08.245
I am never gonna be able to un-see this.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.005
Sorry, honey. Um...

15:11.240 --> 15:14.767
Sweetie, I would like you
to meet my boyfriend, Quentin.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.490
- She is your mother?
- He's your boyfriend?

15:17.000 --> 15:18.081
What?

15:18.240 --> 15:19.765
- Did you say boyfriend?
- I'm sorry. Do you...

15:20.120 --> 15:22.771
- Do you guys know each other?
- I thought it was just, like, a date or...

15:23.520 --> 15:26.364
Can I talk to my mom for a second?

15:26.840 --> 15:30.128
Oh, yeah, listen... Um...

15:30.480 --> 15:31.527
- Laurel doesn't know.
- Yeah.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.444
I'm gonna hit myself over the head
with something very heavy

15:33.640 --> 15:35.642
so that I don't know either.

15:35.840 --> 15:38.127
- All right. Yeah. Okay. Bye, honey.
- Bye, honey.

15:42.320 --> 15:44.368
Isn't Quentin amazing? Oh, my gosh.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.889
Oliver was gonna propose to me
three months ago.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.362
- What?
- Three months ago.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.045
- How do you know?
- It's a long story.

15:51.280 --> 15:53.282
But he was gonna propose
and then we moved back here.

15:53.640 --> 15:56.450
So why didn't he just pop the question
once you settled back in?

16:04.200 --> 16:05.850
- Yes.
- No.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.047
Excuse me.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.806
Hey, hey. hey, hey. What's going on?

16:10.000 --> 16:11.047
- I don't know.
- Is it Darhk?

16:11.240 --> 16:14.244
Inasmuch as that he's the reason that
Laurel and Thea showed up on our doorstep

16:14.400 --> 16:16.846
three months ago.
Right before you were going to propose.

16:17.160 --> 16:19.481
And before you say anything,
you should know that my morn found the ring

16:19.800 --> 16:21.723
- in the decorations box.
- It's not what you think.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.081
Well, that depends on whether or not

16:23.320 --> 16:25.209
you think that I think that
you were gonna propose

16:25.520 --> 16:27.648
- and then that you changed your mind.
- I didn't change my mind.

16:27.880 --> 16:29.370
- Well, something changed.
- Everything changed.

16:29.560 --> 16:33.007
Where we live. What we do. Who we are.

16:34.480 --> 16:36.528
- I was gonna propose.
- Hmm.

16:36.760 --> 16:38.489
But then we came back to Star City.

16:39.360 --> 16:42.091
And then I just needed
some time to rethink things.

16:42.240 --> 16:44.607
Because you thought
I wasn't gonna say yes?

16:44.760 --> 16:48.560
No. Because what we're doing is dangerous.
And I...

16:48.760 --> 16:50.603
But I chose this life. And I chose you.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.922
And I don't understand
why we can't have both.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.605
What do we have here?

17:06.680 --> 17:08.250
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.085
Malbec. Nice.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.925
<i>How did you know that was my favorite red?</i>

17:12.119 --> 17:16.250
So full-bodied, so full of life,
unlike your security outside.

17:17.119 --> 17:20.646
Oh... And in my defense, they fired first.

17:20.920 --> 17:24.128
I guess my invitation
was lost in the mail?

17:24.359 --> 17:26.567
I'm only kidding,
it's not my kind of scene anyway.

17:27.240 --> 17:28.480
Hmm.

17:28.800 --> 17:31.485
I'm only here to have a word
with the man of the hour.

17:32.280 --> 17:33.486
What do you want?

17:33.960 --> 17:36.804
Well, something I can't have, apparently.

17:37.080 --> 17:39.481
Your loyalty, your allegiance.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.926
I told you there'd be
a price to pay if you refused.

17:43.440 --> 17:46.284
I made that decision, not these people.

17:46.960 --> 17:48.485
- Let them go.
- Ooh.

17:48.640 --> 17:50.768
I wish I could do that, I really do.

17:51.240 --> 17:53.402
But sometimes the best way
to teach someone a lesson

17:53.600 --> 17:54.931
isn't to punish them.

17:55.160 --> 17:57.686
It's to punish the ones
he cares about the most.

18:00.440 --> 18:01.680
Bye-bye.

18:07.680 --> 18:09.091
Take them.

18:21.480 --> 18:24.848
- Oliver? Oliver, they took her.
- What?

18:25.600 --> 18:27.204
They took my baby girl.

18:27.680 --> 18:31.526
It's okay. It's okay. I'll get her back.

18:34.840 --> 18:37.161
- They took Thea, too.
- She's gonna be okay.

18:39.280 --> 18:41.362
- What happened?
- It was all over before it started.

18:41.520 --> 18:42.681
John and Thea, they didn't stand a chance,

18:42.840 --> 18:43.887
and I couldn't make a move,

18:44.040 --> 18:45.963
because then Darhk would know
that I was playing for your side.

18:46.160 --> 18:47.730
And I'm not sure that was the right call.

18:47.880 --> 18:49.530
You made the right call.
But we need to track Darhk.

18:49.720 --> 18:51.688
You need to dig up everything
that you can find, okay?

18:51.880 --> 18:53.723
- Yeah. I'm on it.
- Alex?

18:54.040 --> 18:55.724
The police are gonna wanna
ask you about what happened.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.644
Take care of these people.
Get them home if they need it,

18:57.840 --> 18:59.205
get them medical attention
if they need it,

18:59.400 --> 19:02.847
- and pay for it out of the campaign fund.
- Of course. What about the police...

19:03.040 --> 19:04.326
Stall the police.

19:11.840 --> 19:13.729
Tell me where to find Damien Darhk.

19:21.520 --> 19:23.249
Oliver, we'll find them.

19:24.360 --> 19:26.089
Not even the Ghosts know where they are.

19:26.840 --> 19:28.410
Did you learn anything from the hotline?

19:29.040 --> 19:32.249
Only how many
crazy/bored people are in this city.

19:34.760 --> 19:36.091
- Don't go there.
- Where?

19:36.600 --> 19:37.886
Your go-to place.

19:38.440 --> 19:40.602
Where you sit there
and you say that it's all your fault.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.569
Well, it is my fault.
I'm the one who outed Darhk.

19:42.760 --> 19:45.604
I know. I seem to remember us
all being there when you did.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.609
I ran for mayor
because I can protect myself,

19:47.760 --> 19:51.048
- and I thought that all of you could, too.
- And you were right. We can.

19:51.240 --> 19:53.129
I know. But you didn't sign up for this.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.964
Oliver, we can take care of ourselves.

19:56.040 --> 20:00.090
And that's including Felicity.
You inspired a lot of people.

20:00.560 --> 20:04.565
Well, Thea and John and Felicity,
inspiration is not what they need tonight.

20:04.920 --> 20:06.410
Hmm.

20:09.640 --> 20:13.725
But somewhere, someplace,
there is a Ghost that's gonna talk to me.

20:14.480 --> 20:15.720
And what if there isn't?

20:16.640 --> 20:19.610
Then I'm gonna take great pleasure
in trying to make them.

20:22.800 --> 20:24.040
Are you ready?

20:24.800 --> 20:25.881
I hope so.

20:26.040 --> 20:28.930
I don't see how you can free-dive
after only an hour's instruction.

20:29.240 --> 20:31.766
Well, since coming to this island,
I've learned I could do a lot of things

20:32.000 --> 20:33.445
I didn't think I could.
Plus, you're a good teacher.

20:33.640 --> 20:35.449
- I could go with you.
- I know the ship.

20:36.080 --> 20:37.650
I'll be back in a few minutes.

20:51.840 --> 20:53.649
I want every uniform canvassing leads.

20:53.840 --> 20:55.683
I want every detective
talking to every Cl we got.

20:55.840 --> 20:57.285
You get it?

20:57.520 --> 21:00.091
Hey, baby. What's, what's going on?
Something happen?

21:00.320 --> 21:03.164
Got a message from the office.
A tip came through the hotline.

21:03.440 --> 21:05.681
- Yeah. Something we can move on?
- About you.

21:10.480 --> 21:12.847
Come here. Come here.

21:17.200 --> 21:18.804
Are you working for Damien Darhk?

21:19.600 --> 21:21.682
- It's not what you think.
- You don't know what I think.

21:21.960 --> 21:23.371
Darhk threatened you, okay?

21:23.640 --> 21:26.211
I did what I had to do
to keep you safe, honey.

21:26.360 --> 21:27.691
Oh, really? And what's that, Dad?

21:27.960 --> 21:31.009
How many people died?
How many fathers' daughters?

21:31.280 --> 21:32.725
None. I hope. None, I...

21:33.000 --> 21:35.048
I just been eyes and ears, all right?

21:35.280 --> 21:38.887
First for Darhk and then,
for the past month or so, Oliver.

21:39.880 --> 21:41.848
- Oliver knew about this?
- Yeah. He found out.

21:42.120 --> 21:45.488
Didn't take it too well at first,
but then, I think he understood.

21:45.800 --> 21:47.040
Understood what?

21:47.840 --> 21:50.844
That there is nothing I wouldn't do
to protect my baby girl.

21:57.640 --> 21:58.687
Oliver?

22:06.920 --> 22:10.242
- You got something?
- Just a lot of suicidal Ghosts.

22:10.760 --> 22:12.250
- Yeah, and where's that leave us?
- Nowhere.

22:12.600 --> 22:15.524
Honestly, Oliver, this place is even
easier to break into than your last lair.

22:15.760 --> 22:16.841
What the hell is going...

22:17.040 --> 22:18.246
- Dad!
- Malcolm!

22:20.200 --> 22:21.440
We're pressed for time.

22:21.680 --> 22:24.445
Suffice it to say, I'm a little less dead
than most people think.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.367
- What are you doing here?
- My daughter's in danger.

22:30.680 --> 22:32.762
Shouldn't your first question be,
"What took you so long?"

22:35.120 --> 22:36.201
What is this?

22:36.400 --> 22:39.404
HIVE used polyphasic-encrypted
satellite phones to communicate.

22:39.600 --> 22:41.523
- That is one of them.
- And where'd you get it?

22:41.960 --> 22:43.121
I'm Ra's al Ghul.

22:43.360 --> 22:44.691
Maybe we can use the phone to track Darhk.

22:44.960 --> 22:46.769
If Felicity were here, maybe.

22:47.120 --> 22:50.522
But, as it is, our only play
is trading me for them.

22:50.760 --> 22:53.604
Okay, listen, I'm not going to pretend
to understand what is going on here.

22:54.600 --> 22:57.206
But the idea of you
turning yourself over to Darhk,

22:57.400 --> 22:58.890
that's the worst idea
I've heard in a while.

22:59.080 --> 23:00.809
Maybe, but it's our only play.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.481
I brought all this on. I have to end it.

23:07.440 --> 23:09.488
Well, I hope you're all enjoying the city.

23:09.880 --> 23:11.564
You know, we have a lovely symphony

23:11.760 --> 23:13.762
and the best coffee
on the western seaboard.

23:14.280 --> 23:17.602
Wonderful. Ms. Fayad said
you liked to play games, Damien.

23:17.800 --> 23:19.564
- Games?
- Yes, games.

23:19.760 --> 23:21.410
Now you're just wasting our time.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.728
We came here to check
on your progress with Genesis,

23:23.960 --> 23:25.962
not to watch you exercise
a personal vendetta.

23:26.160 --> 23:28.401
Oh. You're talking about
Oliver Queen's friends.

23:28.640 --> 23:31.325
We have greater concerns
than some mayoral campaign.

23:31.840 --> 23:36.004
That campaign's involvement in the
Star City Bay turned out to be a concern.

23:41.840 --> 23:43.080
Well, folks.

23:43.520 --> 23:45.761
Turns out things are
gonna get real interesting.

23:46.520 --> 23:47.806
Real fast.

23:51.640 --> 23:53.324
<i>"DARHK". I was surprised to get your call.</i>

23:53.640 --> 23:55.768
<i>And on one of our secure phones, no less.</i>

23:56.360 --> 23:58.442
You are more than you seem, Oliver.

23:58.680 --> 24:00.808
Oh, you really better hope
that isn't true.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.446
What's the word for a man
who threatens the man

24:05.640 --> 24:07.642
who's holding his
nearest and dearest captive?

24:07.880 --> 24:09.484
I don't know, "idiot"?

24:09.800 --> 24:11.882
You didn't kill my friends.
You took them to make a point.

24:12.480 --> 24:14.323
- You've made it.
- No.

24:16.320 --> 24:17.685
Not yet I haven't.

24:26.840 --> 24:29.161
I'm here. Let my friends go.

24:29.520 --> 24:31.966
I'm sorry, did you think this was
quid pro quo, Mr. Queen?

24:32.160 --> 24:34.527
We had a deal. Now, let my friends go.

24:35.520 --> 24:36.726
Pafience.

24:39.480 --> 24:41.369
Do you know who perfected the gas chamber?

24:41.560 --> 24:42.846
The Nazis.

24:43.200 --> 24:47.364
For years, I wondered why the world would
allow those monsters to exist,

24:47.840 --> 24:49.080
let alone thrive.

24:49.360 --> 24:51.408
<i>And then I realized,
the world needed them to.</i>

24:51.680 --> 24:56.481
As horrible as it sounds,
every now and then humanity needs a reset.

24:56.760 --> 24:58.046
A do-over.

24:58.320 --> 25:00.084
<i>That time has come.</i>

25:00.720 --> 25:02.563
- What is this?
- A demonstration...

25:03.560 --> 25:05.244
Of the project
that you're gonna help us with,

25:05.560 --> 25:07.244
once we install you as mayor.

25:07.560 --> 25:10.211
Think of it as your friends
and family's life insurance policy.

25:10.760 --> 25:12.728
Oh...

25:16.040 --> 25:20.250
Thank you for your service,
your mind and your belief in me.

25:20.840 --> 25:23.286
You will forever be part of our HIVE.

25:34.720 --> 25:35.960
<i>"DARHK". The bloom is active.</i>

25:36.760 --> 25:37.966
Good.

25:40.280 --> 25:44.080
Oh, and by the way, thank you for
doing the legwork on skimming the bay.

25:44.280 --> 25:47.966
My people were using the harbor
to create a certain type of algae.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.926
One that would allow us
to do this undetected.

25:51.200 --> 25:53.043
Hmm? Aw, bummer.

25:53.880 --> 25:55.928
Well, at least he lasted longer
than the previous one.

25:56.120 --> 25:57.451
I guess that's something.

25:58.040 --> 26:01.442
All right, let's continue to adjust
the ratio of the bloom.

26:04.240 --> 26:07.403
If you told me I'd ever get used to
seeing you dressed up like that, I'd...

26:08.240 --> 26:11.084
Excellent, you've got your
bondage outfit on.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.240
No mask for you?

26:13.640 --> 26:14.971
Not my thing.

26:15.760 --> 26:17.842
If we're going after Oliver,
wouldn't it make sense for you

26:18.080 --> 26:20.162
to bring along a few of
your little ninja friends?

26:20.400 --> 26:22.243
I can't afford to pit
the League against HIVE.

26:22.600 --> 26:23.840
Do you have Oliver's location?

26:24.240 --> 26:26.686
An abandoned industrial complex
outside Pennytown.

26:26.920 --> 26:29.491
You'd think Darhk would've checked to see
if he was tagged with a tracker.

26:29.680 --> 26:32.126
Well, I'm sure he did.
Damien's very thorough.

26:32.920 --> 26:35.924
But Oliver had me tag him with
the same particulate nanotechnology

26:36.160 --> 26:38.766
- he used on me last year.
- What about me?

26:39.200 --> 26:42.204
- No. You'll blow your cover with Darhk.
- It's pretty much already blown.

26:42.960 --> 26:44.849
- Can you give us the room?
- Happily.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.600
I have enough father and daughter drama
in my life as it is.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.046
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

26:49.280 --> 26:50.805
Remember, we're on a clock.

26:52.840 --> 26:56.003
Okay. if this is about you not trusting me
anymore after working with Darhk...

26:56.200 --> 26:57.804
No. It's just the opposite.

26:58.720 --> 27:00.006
You've done things.

27:00.200 --> 27:01.725
Things that you'll
never forgive yourself for,

27:01.960 --> 27:03.007
because you were protecting me.

27:03.200 --> 27:06.044
But I'm the one who gets to decide
whether I need anyone's protection.

27:06.640 --> 27:08.324
That's not how
parenting works, sweetheart.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.722
I think that you and I can both agree that

27:11.480 --> 27:13.642
our relationship
is a little unconventional.

27:14.560 --> 27:16.403
I guess the mask
should've been the first clue.

27:16.560 --> 27:17.971
Listen, sweetheart.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.889
You just be careful out there, all right?

27:21.720 --> 27:24.371
'Cause I don't know what I'd do
if anything were to happen to you.

27:24.960 --> 27:26.962
In fact, that's not true,
I know exactly what I would do.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.166
And it'd be ugly.

27:37.400 --> 27:39.243
These people. They're volunteers?

27:39.520 --> 27:41.921
True believers. Every last one.

27:43.560 --> 27:44.846
Oliver!

27:46.000 --> 27:47.240
<i>DARHK'. AW...</i>

27:47.720 --> 27:50.326
Well, I'll give you guys some privacy
to say your farewells.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.962
- Are John and Thea all right?
- Yeah. I think so.

28:02.560 --> 28:04.847
Please, don't tell me that
you traded your life for ours

28:05.120 --> 28:06.849
because that would be
extremely Old Oliver.

28:08.080 --> 28:09.320
I had to turn myself in.

28:09.520 --> 28:11.010
It was the only way to know
where you were being held.

28:11.160 --> 28:12.207
One little problem,

28:12.360 --> 28:14.727
two if you think that Darhk is gonna
keep up his end of the bargain.

28:14.960 --> 28:17.691
But what happens when the cavalry shows up
and the Green Arrow's not present?

28:17.960 --> 28:19.246
Darhk is evil, not stupid.

28:19.440 --> 28:21.044
I have that handled, Felicity.

28:21.640 --> 28:23.130
It had to be this way.

28:23.480 --> 28:27.121
Why? Because you think that we're in
this situation because of your decisions?

28:29.040 --> 28:32.044
Look, I really hate to be the one
to break this to you, Oliver,

28:32.280 --> 28:34.044
but you are not the boss of me.

28:34.560 --> 28:37.643
And I am the one who decides
whether I need anyone's protection.

28:37.920 --> 28:39.206
I know.

28:39.560 --> 28:42.882
Back at the Christmas party from hell,
you said you were gonna propose

28:43.080 --> 28:45.003
and you didn't because you weren't sure

28:45.240 --> 28:47.402
our relationship
could survive this kind of life.

28:49.080 --> 28:50.366
It was a holiday party.

28:52.080 --> 28:54.082
And I had more to say,
but we were attacked.

28:54.760 --> 28:57.411
And here we are, fighting...

28:57.600 --> 29:02.242
Fighting our way through the danger
instead of running away from it.

29:04.400 --> 29:06.209
Isn't that the whole point of marriage?

29:06.960 --> 29:10.248
To get through the hard times because
we're together, not in spite of it?

29:11.520 --> 29:12.760
Um...

29:16.160 --> 29:18.128
Just so you know, if you had asked me...

29:20.680 --> 29:21.920
I would've said yes.

30:14.040 --> 30:16.566
- Ah... Thank you for coming.
- Oh, my God.

30:16.760 --> 30:17.807
<i>What's going on?</i>

30:18.000 --> 30:21.288
The deal is that I bring myself here
and you let my friends go.

30:22.720 --> 30:24.006
Hey!

30:26.640 --> 30:29.325
- Let me go!
- I am so sorry about this.

30:31.520 --> 30:32.601
We had a deal!

30:32.800 --> 30:35.280
Well, I think if you replay
our conversation in your mind,

30:35.560 --> 30:39.929
our bargain was only, at best, implied.
Even so... Bad guy, remember?

30:40.240 --> 30:42.891
- You let them go.
- I will. Existentially speaking.

30:43.160 --> 30:45.970
You do this and you lose any leverage
that you have over me.

30:46.320 --> 30:49.130
Wrong. As long as they're alive
you have something to fight for.

30:49.400 --> 30:51.607
That is what I'm taking away from you,
but don't worry.

30:51.800 --> 30:53.086
It's painless.

30:54.080 --> 30:55.320
Well, mostly.

31:13.880 --> 31:16.884
Look for seams, this place
may not be 100% sealed.

31:23.800 --> 31:26.371
Oh, Oliver, don't worry.
There are plenty of fish.

31:26.680 --> 31:29.331
If it's blondes you like, I can have one
at your house in 20 minutes.

31:29.640 --> 31:30.926
<i>One that I won't kill.</i>

32:01.040 --> 32:02.565
Hey! Come on. Let's go.

32:06.400 --> 32:09.404
- Hey. I thought I'd lost you.
- I'm here. I'm here.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.445
Is this guy my father?

32:22.520 --> 32:25.683
Really? And here I was ready
to just call it even for the night.

32:26.200 --> 32:27.486
You may go.

32:29.080 --> 32:32.084
As the kids say, "I got this."

32:34.920 --> 32:36.763
You really haven't learned anything,
have you?

32:37.040 --> 32:39.088
Oh... I might've learned a little.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.091
Where's Malcolm?

32:57.320 --> 32:58.560
There you go.

32:59.440 --> 33:02.284
I am dying to see
what's beneath that mask.

33:03.800 --> 33:05.768
Seems like you're dying a bit, too.

33:14.960 --> 33:16.769
We shouldn't leave all these guys here.

33:16.960 --> 33:19.645
If they're anything like Darhk's guy
in the gas chamber, we probably should.

33:25.120 --> 33:27.521
Okay, they're definitely like
Darhk's guy in the gas chamber.

33:36.280 --> 33:37.611
Is that the best you've got?

33:38.160 --> 33:40.128
There's four of you and a lot more of us.

33:40.400 --> 33:42.926
Yeah, well, now there's five.

34:03.520 --> 34:05.522
I guess you decided
you didn't need anyone's protection.

34:07.760 --> 34:09.284
I brought the cavalry.
Hope you don't mind.

34:09.800 --> 34:11.040
Let's go!

34:16.360 --> 34:17.440
Good news.

34:17.639 --> 34:21.565
I'm gonna let you live long enough
to watch me kill your little green buddy.

34:26.080 --> 34:27.320
Get clear!

34:47.800 --> 34:50.121
Are you sure that Darhk
didn't make it out of the explosion?

34:50.600 --> 34:51.931
Have you seen any horror movies?

34:52.120 --> 34:53.724
These guys don't stay dead.

34:54.040 --> 34:55.882
Especially if you can't find a body.

34:56.360 --> 34:58.249
Whoa! Glass half-empty much?

34:58.840 --> 35:01.207
Good news is,
whatever Darhk had going on there,

35:01.720 --> 35:03.370
- we lit it up pretty good.
- Where is Merlyn?

35:03.560 --> 35:05.403
Said he had to attend to League business.

35:05.600 --> 35:07.682
Can't believe I'm gonna say this,
but I owe him one.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.923
- I helped out a little bit, too.
- Yes, you did.

35:10.160 --> 35:11.924
Wait. Aren't we supposed to
go to that thingy?

35:12.320 --> 35:13.560
What thingy?

35:13.920 --> 35:16.890
It's a surprise. You're not the only one
who can keep a secret.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.446
- What happened?
- Shark!

35:26.600 --> 35:28.204
Guess I don't taste very good.

35:29.520 --> 35:31.010
On!

35:31.240 --> 35:33.129
That is gonna leave a scar.

35:33.760 --> 35:35.000
Ahhh...

35:36.200 --> 35:37.486
What?

35:37.920 --> 35:39.160
Well, hey, Taiana.

35:39.880 --> 35:42.360
You're a little less dead
than you're supposed to be.

35:43.080 --> 35:46.482
And you, you may not be a spy
but you're definitely a liar.

35:46.760 --> 35:49.286
Which means you're probably
lying about being a spy.

35:51.200 --> 35:53.248
I'm gonna enjoy taking pieces out of you.

36:01.720 --> 36:03.529
- What do you want?
- To talk.

36:04.200 --> 36:06.089
- Thought you gave up on that.
- I did.

36:06.320 --> 36:08.687
Until I met your cult leader,
Damien Darhk.

36:08.880 --> 36:10.086
It's not a cult.

36:10.280 --> 36:11.645
The man has people, regular people,

36:11.880 --> 36:14.531
honest people, I'm thinking,
so brainwashed.

36:14.800 --> 36:17.451
They're willing to die for him. Cult.

36:17.720 --> 36:19.529
You know what?
Think what you wanna think.

36:19.800 --> 36:22.883
It's a free country. For now.

36:23.480 --> 36:24.720
This isn't you, Andy.

36:29.480 --> 36:30.720
The man I knew...

36:31.760 --> 36:33.364
Pulled me out of dark waters...

36:33.760 --> 36:35.888
Convinced me to keep going
when I didn't see the point.

36:36.160 --> 36:39.323
No. What you didn't see,
what you failed to see

36:39.520 --> 36:40.806
is the man I really am.

36:41.720 --> 36:44.166
Right in front of you. The whole time.

36:44.360 --> 36:45.885
So my brother's a Ghost.

36:47.640 --> 36:50.007
Fine. We'll treat you like a Ghost.

36:57.520 --> 36:59.363
Your vigilante problem's getting worse.

36:59.640 --> 37:02.484
Oh, relax, Ms. Nixon.
Focus on the here and now.

37:02.680 --> 37:05.001
There's concerns that
you're leading us off the rails.

37:05.240 --> 37:09.165
No. I'm leading us
exactly where we need to be.

37:11.520 --> 37:12.806
Beautiful, isn't it?

37:13.120 --> 37:15.009
And I don't even like corn.

37:15.640 --> 37:20.362
Go ahead. Breathe. Drink it in.
Tell me what it reminds you of.

37:20.600 --> 37:23.922
- It seems so real.
- Ah. I liken it to the air on Everest.

37:24.160 --> 37:27.767
A little thin, maybe but just enough
to keep things interesting.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.809
I thought the tests had failed.

37:30.080 --> 37:31.320
Not the last one.

37:31.880 --> 37:34.167
Thanks to the algae
we engineered from Star City Bay,

37:34.360 --> 37:37.045
the air down here
is now perfectly breathable.

37:37.280 --> 37:39.009
<i>We are right on schedule.</i>

37:40.520 --> 37:43.649
- Phase four begins now.
- And what of Oliver Queen?

37:49.800 --> 37:51.768
This was all Alex's idea.

37:52.040 --> 37:54.247
Here to show the people
that you're not backing down.

37:54.480 --> 37:56.528
All you got to do is flick a switch
and give a speech.

37:56.760 --> 37:57.807
That's it?

37:58.040 --> 37:59.690
We'll be here waiting for you
when you're done.

38:01.440 --> 38:03.329
- You're coming with me.
- No.

38:05.920 --> 38:08.161
Oh... Please. Hey.

38:08.360 --> 38:10.522
Oh, thank you.

38:10.840 --> 38:12.251
<i>Thank you everyone.</i>

38:12.880 --> 38:14.370
This week,

38:14.920 --> 38:17.446
an event just like this was
interrupted by terrorists.

38:18.080 --> 38:19.570
But all of us are here tonight

38:20.240 --> 38:22.561
to send those people
a very simple message.

38:24.400 --> 38:26.368
We're not gonna let the darkness win.

38:26.640 --> 38:30.406
So all of us are here
to light a candle together.

38:30.640 --> 38:31.880
United.

38:38.320 --> 38:41.449
This right there is possible
because of all of you.

38:41.760 --> 38:44.081
And I am grateful for each one of you.

38:45.520 --> 38:49.684
There is one person in particular
that I am grateful for.

38:52.680 --> 38:53.806
You.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.844
<i>Someone that has stood beside me</i>

38:57.680 --> 38:59.011
when times were darkest.

39:02.080 --> 39:04.208
She's the one who lights my way.

39:09.680 --> 39:10.920
Felicity Smoak...

39:15.040 --> 39:16.485
Would you make me...

39:17.720 --> 39:20.769
The happiest man on the face of the Earth?

39:23.600 --> 39:25.523
- Yes?
- Yes.

39:57.240 --> 39:59.242
It looks even bigger in here.

40:00.520 --> 40:01.760
Ooh...

40:02.280 --> 40:05.363
You know what? To tell you the truth,
I don't even care about the bling.

40:06.320 --> 40:08.084
All I care about is you.

40:34.040 --> 40:35.690
What's going on?

41:37.640 --> 41:39.005
Felicity!
