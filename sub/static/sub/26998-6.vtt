[lightning sizzles]

01:18.369 --> 01:20.371
[bats screeching]

01:48.858 --> 01:50.777
Can I get you something?

01:51.986 --> 01:52.987
Some...

01:53.446 --> 01:54.364
uh...

01:55.657 --> 01:57.742
-yummy almond--
-I don't want a snack, Ms. Wardwell.

01:57.826 --> 01:58.952
I want answers.

01:59.869 --> 02:01.496
Yes, of course. Um...

02:04.499 --> 02:09.003
You asked me what I am, but you know.
I believe you've known for a while.

02:09.087 --> 02:11.506
-You're a--
-A witch, yes.

02:11.589 --> 02:15.176
-All this time you've been lying to me?
-Protecting you.

02:15.385 --> 02:16.553
Trying to.

02:16.636 --> 02:19.013
-Watching you from afar.
-Watching me, how?

02:20.723 --> 02:23.560
I used a... a scrying spell.

02:24.477 --> 02:25.520
On your mirrors.

02:25.603 --> 02:27.939
It's how I knew you were
at the mercy of the Batibat.

02:28.022 --> 02:32.443
You've been spying on me?
And my family? Why?

02:34.320 --> 02:38.283
No. I think it's best you answer these
questions in front of the High Priest.

02:40.535 --> 02:44.789
Sabrina, please, it was Edward
that asked me to look after you.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.334
What do you know about my father?

02:49.002 --> 02:49.836
I...

02:52.297 --> 02:53.715
I was his acolyte.

02:56.634 --> 02:58.052
His student, then...

02:59.679 --> 03:00.638
his secretary.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.683
When he was High Priest
of the Church of Night?

03:04.058 --> 03:04.934
Yes.

03:07.312 --> 03:08.271
Please.

03:13.610 --> 03:14.652
I, um...

03:16.196 --> 03:17.322
I sought him out.

03:17.655 --> 03:21.326
I had been excommunicated
from my own coven...

03:22.285 --> 03:24.454
the Church of Shadows, in New Hampshire.

03:24.954 --> 03:29.834
I'd fallen in love with a mortal, you see,
and was engaged to be married. [chuckles]

03:31.044 --> 03:36.883
Foolish, but... there I was,
a witch without a coven.

03:37.342 --> 03:40.553
With no one to understand my plight.
No one, that is, except--

03:40.637 --> 03:41.721
My father.

03:44.390 --> 03:49.812
I showed up on his doorstep,
eager to apprentice with him.

03:50.563 --> 03:51.814
Edward Spellman,

03:52.482 --> 03:55.276
who wanted to reform
the Church of Night,

03:55.610 --> 04:01.532
change its laws so that witches
and mortals could marry without stigma.

04:02.242 --> 04:06.037
-He and your mother would be pioneers.
-But then they died.

04:06.746 --> 04:08.122
Their plane crashed.

04:11.709 --> 04:14.879
Before that ill-fated trip,

04:15.129 --> 04:18.174
Edward charged me
with keeping an eye on you...

04:19.509 --> 04:20.635
his only daughter.

04:20.718 --> 04:22.845
Is that why
you were encouraging me to transfer,

04:22.929 --> 04:26.933
because you knew
what I was talking about all along?

04:27.517 --> 04:29.686
Going to the academy? Getting baptized?

04:29.769 --> 04:31.229
Yes. Precisely.

04:31.980 --> 04:37.151
I don't understand. If...
my aunts were taking care of me,

04:37.694 --> 04:39.862
why would my father ask you
to do the same?

04:40.321 --> 04:43.074
He was cautious, overly cautious.

04:43.157 --> 04:46.661
Especially when it came to you,
the apple of his eye.

04:46.744 --> 04:48.246
I was to be an invisible,

04:48.329 --> 04:53.084
but omnipresent circle of protection
around you.

04:53.167 --> 04:54.669
Why would you agree to that?

04:55.586 --> 04:59.007
I had fallen in love with him, you see.

05:01.718 --> 05:05.471
-Forgive me, Sabrina. Please.
-You're just like him, Ms. Wardwell.

05:05.555 --> 05:09.058
Keeping secrets from me, manipulating me.

05:09.142 --> 05:12.645
Consider your obligation
to the Spellman family done.

05:13.062 --> 05:15.940
From now on, stay away from me.

05:21.696 --> 05:24.615
[door opens and closes]

05:26.367 --> 05:29.287
[Sabrina] We can add Ms. Wardwell
to the list of liars,

05:29.370 --> 05:31.706
betrayers, and spies in my life.

05:31.873 --> 05:33.958
[Ambrose] It's a lucky thing
she was spying on you, cous.

05:34.292 --> 05:37.462
Else, we might all still be trapped
in the Batibat's nightmares.

05:38.588 --> 05:40.631
Then again, I sort of am, aren't I?

05:41.841 --> 05:42.884
Ambrose?

05:43.676 --> 05:46.346
Might I suggest you give the woman
the benefit of the doubt?

05:46.429 --> 05:47.638
[Sabrina] I don't have it in me.

05:48.931 --> 05:50.641
My father deceived me.

05:50.725 --> 05:53.603
-Aunt Zelda deceived me. Now my teacher?
-All right, then.

05:53.686 --> 05:56.689
Get me a bit of her hair
and I'll make all her teeth fall out.

05:57.148 --> 05:59.233
I'm not quite sure what to do yet.

06:00.818 --> 06:02.111
One thing's for sure.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.906
I'm gonna wipe all the mirrors
in the house clean

06:04.989 --> 06:06.699
of Ms. Wardwell's spells.

06:08.993 --> 06:10.161
No more spying.

06:13.247 --> 06:15.249
[rock music playing]

06:21.089 --> 06:22.256
[Harvey gasps]

06:22.840 --> 06:24.592
[neck cracking]

06:25.760 --> 06:28.554
You are gutless, boy.

06:28.763 --> 06:31.516
Your soul is filled with fear,

06:31.891 --> 06:34.352
and you will die for it.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.897
-What're you still doing awake?
-[gasps, sighs]

06:38.147 --> 06:40.149
-Uh...
-You okay?

06:40.775 --> 06:42.735
Dad'll be pissed
if he sees you're up at this hour.

06:42.819 --> 06:43.986
[Harvey] Yeah. Uh...

06:45.905 --> 06:47.281
[stammers] It's nothing.

06:48.324 --> 06:51.285
In that case, 'night, nerd.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.082
[sighs]

07:02.922 --> 07:04.215
[bottles clink]

07:09.637 --> 07:11.889
There is no faith in you, girl.

07:11.973 --> 07:14.684
-[Roz screams]
-So as punishment,

07:15.393 --> 07:17.770
you shall be made blind.

07:18.563 --> 07:19.480
[man] Rosalind?

07:20.648 --> 07:22.608
-[Roz sighs]
-What's wrong?

07:23.276 --> 07:24.235
Nothing.

07:24.819 --> 07:25.695
Uh...

07:27.989 --> 07:29.657
I just spilled milk.

07:34.829 --> 07:36.372
[rattling]

07:40.960 --> 07:42.044
[gasps]

07:42.170 --> 07:45.381
You're an abomination, boy-girl...

07:47.717 --> 07:50.428
and he will smite you.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.555
[wind whooshes]

07:54.515 --> 07:55.975

-[music playing]
-[people chattering]

08:44.482 --> 08:48.736
Um... What I lack in experience,
I do make up for in enthusiasm.

08:49.862 --> 08:52.573
I, uh, get on with most everyone.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.534
I-- I love to read.

08:54.951 --> 08:59.664
Um, I love a good chat. [chuckles]
I'm a wonderful baker.

08:59.956 --> 09:04.669
And, uh, I have to say I'm a very big fan
of yours, Dr. Cerberus.

09:05.127 --> 09:07.630
I love my horror hosts, you see. Um...

09:07.797 --> 09:12.260
Svengoolie, um,
Count Gore de Vol, Vampira.

09:12.343 --> 09:16.764
We didn't have them back in England.
But I have quite the assortment on video.

09:16.847 --> 09:19.183
You do know I started out
as Greendale's weatherman--

09:19.267 --> 09:20.726
Weatherman, yeah. [chuckles]

09:22.520 --> 09:26.774
Well, nowadays, there's not
so much demand for horror hosts. Uh--

09:26.857 --> 09:27.900
Oh.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.694
To pay the bills, I opened up this place.

09:30.528 --> 09:32.989
A bookstore for the weird
and dispossessed.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.575
May I ask you a question, Hilda?

09:35.658 --> 09:36.617
Yes.

09:36.701 --> 09:40.037
How do you feel about wearing a costume
while you're working here?

09:41.372 --> 09:42.582
[chuckles softly] Yeah.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.293
[both chuckle]

09:48.879 --> 09:51.507
What do you hear? Sister?

09:53.259 --> 09:55.261
[heart beating steadily]

09:55.928 --> 09:56.971
There's a heartbeat.

09:58.556 --> 10:02.977
[sighs] Praise Satan.
How long before we can determine its sex?

10:03.060 --> 10:05.479
It's still a bit too early
in Lady Blackwood's gestation,

10:05.563 --> 10:08.482
but I'll collect a urine sample
and see what we can find out.

10:08.566 --> 10:11.068
What about blood pressure?
Earlier today, she felt faint.

10:11.152 --> 10:12.653
Perhaps you could give us ladies space,

10:12.737 --> 10:15.406
so we might conduct this examination
more efficiently?

10:15.781 --> 10:17.867
It's fine, Faustus. Take some air.

10:18.743 --> 10:19.577
Very well.

10:20.494 --> 10:21.537
I'll be outside.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.586
[door opens and closes]

10:28.753 --> 10:30.713
It's a rather trying time for us.

10:31.422 --> 10:32.965
Carrying a Child of Night to term

10:33.049 --> 10:35.760
should be the most joyous 13 months
in a witch's life.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.054
I agree. Except...

10:39.639 --> 10:42.516
two of our children
have already been called home

10:42.600 --> 10:44.518
by the Dark Lord before their births.

10:45.603 --> 10:46.937
The High Priest told me.

10:47.021 --> 10:48.606
I'm so very sorry.

10:51.567 --> 10:53.277
My husband wants a son, Sister Zelda.

10:54.654 --> 10:55.821
A male heir.

10:56.947 --> 11:01.077
Well... we'll know soon enough
if it is the Dark Lord's will.

11:07.208 --> 11:10.086
-[Susie] It really freaked me out.
-What's going on, guys?

11:10.753 --> 11:12.171
What freaked you out, Susie?

11:13.464 --> 11:15.675
Susie's uncle is messed up.

11:15.966 --> 11:17.468
Beyond messed up.

11:17.551 --> 11:20.721
He had a breakdown in the mines,
and he's been acting crazy ever since.

11:20.805 --> 11:22.431
-He attacked Harvey.
-What?

11:22.848 --> 11:24.600
-Attacked you where?
-Susie's place.

11:25.017 --> 11:28.979
-That's what I was gonna tell you.
-[Susie] My dad called a doctor.

11:29.063 --> 11:30.856
Maybe he should call an exorcist instead.

11:30.940 --> 11:31.899
[Roz chuckles]

11:31.982 --> 11:33.776
[stammers] What-- What does that mean?

11:34.485 --> 11:36.737
I was telling Susie and Roz.

11:37.988 --> 11:40.199
You know that thing I saw in the mines?

11:41.075 --> 11:42.201
Jesse saw it, too.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.622
-How do you know? Did he say that?
-[Susie] He said a lot of crazy stuff.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.249
He said he saw a monster.

11:48.332 --> 11:50.459
And then he said
he was gonna eat Harvey's soul.

11:51.168 --> 11:52.211
Point being:

11:53.421 --> 11:55.089
Maybe whatever's down there is a...

11:55.965 --> 12:00.302
a demon and it... I don't know,
possessed Jesse.

12:00.553 --> 12:03.472
Harvey, come on. I mean,

12:03.556 --> 12:06.517
-is demonic possession even a thing?
-[Roz] There's something else.

12:07.435 --> 12:08.477
[stammers] Um...

12:09.395 --> 12:11.522
This is gonna sound kind of crazy...

12:13.107 --> 12:15.234
but I like saw Uncle Jesse
in my house last night,

12:15.317 --> 12:19.071
and he was saying
horrible things to me, about me, and--

12:19.155 --> 12:20.072
Me, too.

12:20.740 --> 12:21.615
Same.

12:22.241 --> 12:25.077
Maybe it was... nightmares.

12:25.369 --> 12:28.706
This wasn't a nightmare, 'Brina.
And Jesse might not be possessed,

12:28.789 --> 12:30.666
but he definitely looks
like he's possessed.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.127
Well, whatever is wrong
with your uncle, Susie,

12:33.210 --> 12:35.713
promise me you're not
gonna go back in there, okay?

12:35.796 --> 12:38.883
Trust me, wild horses
couldn't drag me back in there.

12:44.638 --> 12:45.931
[Harvey] <i>Sabrina! Wait up!</i>

12:46.307 --> 12:48.476
What was that about in the library?
You don't believe me?

12:48.559 --> 12:49.935
About what I saw in the mines?

12:51.020 --> 12:54.231
No, I... I believe you saw something,

12:54.315 --> 12:57.693
but... you were eight. You were terrified.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.571
-I'm not a coward, Sabrina.
-No, of course not, but--

13:00.654 --> 13:02.823
-And I know what I saw.
-It could have been anything.

13:02.907 --> 13:05.534
A shadow, or rocks. I mean...

13:05.785 --> 13:07.161
What about last night?

13:07.620 --> 13:10.623
What about what Roz saw, what Susie saw?
What I saw?

13:10.706 --> 13:12.416
Isn't it possible it was your imagination?

13:12.500 --> 13:13.584
All of our imaginations?

13:13.667 --> 13:15.920
-What do you want me to say?
-I want you to believe me.

13:17.546 --> 13:19.381
Or at least be honest
about what you're thinking.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.300
'Cause it doesn't feel like you are.

13:28.098 --> 13:29.141
Oh, Sabrina.

13:30.017 --> 13:32.895
Do you have a moment? I'd love to continue
our conversation from--

13:32.978 --> 13:34.063
I told you, Ms. Wardwell,

13:34.146 --> 13:37.191
I'm not interested in
any more of your half-truths.

13:40.361 --> 13:43.072
Aunties! We have a big problem!

13:43.280 --> 13:46.617
Mephistopheles save us
from the melodramatics of a teenage witch.

13:46.700 --> 13:48.035
[Hilda] How was school, love?

13:48.118 --> 13:52.081
Fine, but Susie's Uncle Jesse
has been possessed by a demon.

13:52.164 --> 13:55.918
-Oh? How do you know that, love?
-Oh, only all my friends.

13:56.377 --> 13:59.839
While I was at the academy, or maybe
while we were dealing with Batibat,

13:59.922 --> 14:01.966
Uncle Jesse attacked Harvey.

14:02.049 --> 14:03.592
They had to restrain him.

14:04.176 --> 14:07.388
Sabrina, cases of actual
demonic possession are extremely rare,

14:07.471 --> 14:10.975
despite what the False God and his
propaganda machine would have you believe.

14:11.058 --> 14:12.560
[Hilda] Have they called a doctor yet?

14:12.643 --> 14:15.479
Because they need to rule out
every other possibility first.

14:15.563 --> 14:19.191
Like, epilepsy,
or schizophrenia, Tourette's.

14:20.734 --> 14:23.487
Aunties, my mortal friends
are talking about demons.

14:23.571 --> 14:25.656
What if they start
talking about witches next?

14:26.991 --> 14:30.286
-The entire coven could be exposed.
-Who's talking about witches?

14:30.619 --> 14:33.581
Give me their names and I'll make sure
they stop talking about anything.

14:33.747 --> 14:34.582
Permanently.

14:35.666 --> 14:39.044
It's just terrible when teenagers slip
into comas, isn't it, Hilda?

14:39.420 --> 14:41.255
[Sabrina] Susie is my friend.

14:41.338 --> 14:45.259
I won't leave her in a house
with a dangerous, possibly possessed man.

14:45.342 --> 14:48.596
We are not to involve ourselves
in mortal affairs,

14:49.263 --> 14:53.684
but... tell your friend not to touch
the inhabited person.

14:53.767 --> 14:56.145
That contact would make them vulnerable
to attacks.

14:56.228 --> 14:58.355
[stammers] What kind of attacks?

14:58.856 --> 15:00.024
Psychological.

15:00.316 --> 15:04.320
Demons prey on your fears, your... shame,

15:04.737 --> 15:05.571
etcetera.

15:06.322 --> 15:08.449
Harvey, Roz, and Susie
had to tie Uncle Jesse up.

15:08.532 --> 15:11.160
They all touched him
and they've all had visions

15:11.243 --> 15:12.620
or visitations since then.

15:12.703 --> 15:16.290
Get them to bathe in a bit of
blessed water from the Sea of Galilee.

15:16.373 --> 15:18.626
That always does the trick.
[chuckles softly]

15:19.251 --> 15:20.586
[Ambrose] <i>Demonic possession?</i>

15:21.086 --> 15:22.922
I have loads of books
on the subject.

15:23.005 --> 15:25.633
Can you pull them for me?
And then stand guard over my body

15:25.716 --> 15:28.636
-while I astral-project into Jesse's room?
-[laughs]

15:29.219 --> 15:31.055
Is that the soundest of plans, cousin?

15:31.138 --> 15:33.349
The astral plane is treacherous.
And the psychopomps--

15:33.432 --> 15:36.101
I won't be projecting long enough
for the psychopomps to gather,

15:36.185 --> 15:38.145
and I need to see Jesse for myself.

15:38.354 --> 15:41.690
I can't very well just walk into his room.
This is the only way.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.651
Plus, if Jesse is possessed,

15:43.734 --> 15:46.362
maybe I can find out who the demon is,
or what it wants.

15:46.445 --> 15:48.656
Having a name is always helpful.

15:48.739 --> 15:51.825
Besides, this will be good practice
for when I go up against the Dark Lord.

15:51.909 --> 15:54.745
[scoffs]
Damn if you're not getting a bit cocky.

15:54.828 --> 15:57.081
In my astral form, I'll be safe.

15:57.164 --> 15:59.708
I won't have a body
for the demon to hurt or enter.

15:59.792 --> 16:00.709
Cousin.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.879
Ambrose, please.
If Jesse Putnam is possessed,

16:03.963 --> 16:06.590
he's a soul in torment,
imprisoned by demonic forces.

16:06.674 --> 16:08.008
He's not the only one.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.260
I'm imprisoned too, don't forget that.

16:11.178 --> 16:13.305
Jesse's possessed,
you're under house arrest.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.057
-That's not the same thing.
-True.

16:15.182 --> 16:17.643
His ordeal will be much shorter than mine.

16:17.726 --> 16:19.645
Ambrose, if I could help you, I would.

16:20.562 --> 16:23.357
If you insist on projecting...

16:26.151 --> 16:27.653
you do so at your own peril.

16:30.406 --> 16:31.407
[Salem meows]

16:31.865 --> 16:33.867
[purring]

16:45.546 --> 16:46.547
Hello.

16:52.761 --> 16:56.098
-Didn't mean to intrude.
-[demon] Won't you have a seat?

16:56.348 --> 16:58.350
[chair creaking]

16:59.852 --> 17:00.769
No, thanks.

17:01.603 --> 17:02.479
I'll stand.

17:04.189 --> 17:05.733
Come closer.

17:06.108 --> 17:09.278
There's something about you
I can't quite...

17:11.363 --> 17:12.322
Oh!

17:13.574 --> 17:14.742
You're corrupt.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.785
Impure.

17:17.453 --> 17:19.246
But in what way, though?

17:19.329 --> 17:21.123
What are you doing here, demon?

17:21.457 --> 17:22.624
What do you want?

17:22.708 --> 17:28.756
Spoil, debase, and corrupt humans,
starting with this vessel.

17:29.006 --> 17:32.301
And when I'm done,
I'll move on to your friends,

17:32.384 --> 17:35.345
who were impolite
and tied me like an animal.

17:35.429 --> 17:37.473
You don't need to stay tied up here.

17:37.556 --> 17:39.558
-You could leave Jesse's body--
-Leave?

17:39.850 --> 17:41.560
Why would I do that?

17:41.810 --> 17:46.315
-It's so nice and warm and sinful in here.
-Is that why you chose him?

17:46.398 --> 17:48.859
-Was Jesse sinful?
-He's a sodomite.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.819
An abomination.

17:50.903 --> 17:55.240
More than anything,
Jesse Putnam was convenient.

17:55.574 --> 17:59.870
My possession is his reward
for setting me free.

17:59.953 --> 18:02.247
-What's your name?
-[neck cracks] What's yours?

18:02.331 --> 18:03.624
I'm Sabrina Spellman,

18:03.707 --> 18:06.126
daughter of High Priest and Conjuror,
Edward Spellman.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.419
So you're a witch.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.547
In that case,
there's no harm in telling you:

18:11.507 --> 18:13.258
I am Maerceci.

18:14.134 --> 18:15.260
Overlord of Gluttony.

18:15.803 --> 18:19.223
Devourer of Flesh. Demon from the Bowels.

18:19.306 --> 18:21.767
The Putnams don't want you here, Maerceci.

18:21.850 --> 18:26.105
I don't want you here, so leave now,
before things get bad for you.

18:26.188 --> 18:27.773
If you think I'm bluffing,

18:27.856 --> 18:31.026
I'll happily introduce you
to another of your kind that I--

18:31.110 --> 18:33.070
[roars]

18:34.530 --> 18:36.907
You're not even here.

18:37.616 --> 18:38.992
How rude.

18:51.755 --> 18:53.173
Did you leave?

18:54.967 --> 18:56.009
Maerceci?

18:57.886 --> 18:58.846
Jesse?

19:00.472 --> 19:01.932
[demon makes a hissing growl]

19:02.141 --> 19:04.143
[choking]

19:07.146 --> 19:09.898
[retching, gasping]

19:12.359 --> 19:14.361
-[Sabrina screams]
-[Salem meows]

19:18.949 --> 19:21.660
-[Sabrina coughs]
-[Salem meows]

19:22.536 --> 19:24.121
-She's what now?
-[Salem meows]

19:24.371 --> 19:26.165
[Salem yowls]

19:27.791 --> 19:29.960
[choking]

19:30.043 --> 19:32.045
[gasping]

19:33.088 --> 19:34.506
-Cousin!
-[grunting]

19:38.010 --> 19:40.262
[gasping, panting]

19:51.481 --> 19:54.651
It felt like he was slithering
down my throat.

19:56.361 --> 19:58.697
How did he do that? How could he touch me?

19:58.780 --> 20:00.490
[Ambrose]
The bugger must be a higher demon.

20:00.574 --> 20:03.952
Some of them can lay hands on your
astral body if they find you in the realm.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.288
I don't want to say,
"I told you so," but--

20:06.371 --> 20:08.123
I got his name, Ambrose.

20:08.415 --> 20:10.000
Maerceci.

20:11.793 --> 20:13.503
[Ambrose sighs]

20:14.338 --> 20:16.924
Mmm. Can't say it rings any bells.

20:17.341 --> 20:20.469
It's not Euphratean or Mesopotamian.

20:20.677 --> 20:24.848
Maybe I can ask Nicholas Scratch
or Father Blackwood. I mean,

20:24.932 --> 20:27.267
-they are demonologists, after all.
-[laughs]

20:29.353 --> 20:30.312
No need.

20:31.146 --> 20:35.442
Jesse's demon isn't Sumerian at all.

20:36.401 --> 20:41.281
He's just a cheeky bastard
with a fondness for wordplay.

20:41.531 --> 20:42.741
[Sabrina] Ice cream?

20:43.575 --> 20:44.785
[paper crushing]

20:44.910 --> 20:46.745
Demons have an awful sense of humor.

20:47.454 --> 20:51.083
And can you blame them? They live in hell.
Do you have any other tidbits?

20:52.626 --> 20:56.755
He said something
about Uncle Jesse setting him free.

20:57.047 --> 20:58.298
Free?

20:59.424 --> 21:00.676
From what?

21:01.343 --> 21:02.344
Or where?

21:04.221 --> 21:05.180
I...

21:06.265 --> 21:09.268
[Ambrose]
Cousin? Where are you going?

21:10.644 --> 21:12.437
You almost died.

21:13.438 --> 21:14.606
[Ambrose sighs]

21:15.315 --> 21:16.608
I was wrong, Harvey.

21:17.067 --> 21:19.444
It was wrong of me
to dismiss what you said,

21:19.736 --> 21:20.612
what you saw.

21:21.655 --> 21:23.907
-I'm sorry.
-I knew there was something fishy

21:23.991 --> 21:28.245
-about the way you were acting in school.
-I wasn't lying exactly, I...

21:29.538 --> 21:31.206
didn't want what you were saying
to be true.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.958
But now you admit it might be.

21:33.041 --> 21:35.627
I'm open to the possibility
of what you're thinking.

21:35.836 --> 21:40.007
And I... I want to go into the mines.

21:41.008 --> 21:41.842
What?

21:41.925 --> 21:47.180
To see if I can find some clue
as to what might still be affecting Jesse.

21:47.264 --> 21:49.808
If you could get past security
by yourself, and that's a big if,

21:49.891 --> 21:52.853
you'd never be able to find your way
around. It's like a maze down there.

21:52.936 --> 21:54.646
-Could you draw me a map?
-A map?

21:55.147 --> 21:58.608
-To what, this isn't <i>The Goonies.</i>
-To where Jesse was working.

21:58.692 --> 22:01.194
Where he was working last
before he got sick.

22:01.903 --> 22:05.032
-Could you find out where that was?
-I mean, I could ask Tommy.

22:05.115 --> 22:08.243
But, 'Brina, literally anything could
happen to you down there.

22:08.535 --> 22:11.371
You could break your ankle,
a demon could eat you--

22:11.455 --> 22:12.497
I'm not afraid.

22:15.792 --> 22:17.794
[demon growling]

22:19.421 --> 22:20.339
Harvey?

22:24.885 --> 22:26.261
You think I'm chicken shit?

22:27.054 --> 22:28.847
No, I don't.

22:30.140 --> 22:32.476
-I'm coming with you.
-No. No, that's not what I want.

22:32.559 --> 22:33.685
I don't care what you want.

22:33.769 --> 22:37.105
I'm not letting you go into the mineshaft,
alone, in the dead of night.

22:37.189 --> 22:40.150
Besides, you're gonna need someone
to help sneak you in.

22:41.693 --> 22:43.695
[caws]

22:52.412 --> 22:53.663
[Harvey exhales]

22:55.457 --> 22:57.751
-If you wanna just wait here...
-[sighs]

22:59.169 --> 23:00.253
Hell, no.

23:07.969 --> 23:09.971
[bats screeching]

23:16.937 --> 23:19.564
-[Harvey] What exactly are we looking for?
-[Sabrina] Um...

23:20.399 --> 23:24.986
I guess anything that looks...
strange or...

23:26.029 --> 23:26.863
dangerous.

23:27.531 --> 23:28.949
You mean like a demon?

23:30.033 --> 23:33.453
[chuckles] Well, I'm glad you haven't lost
your sense of humor, at least.

23:36.206 --> 23:38.250
[low moan on wind]

23:41.044 --> 23:42.796
Wait, what's...

23:54.516 --> 23:58.645
[metal squeaks in distance,
low creaking]

24:00.439 --> 24:03.358
Harvey, I think I found something.

24:03.733 --> 24:06.862
[low moan on wind]

24:07.070 --> 24:08.071
Harvey?

24:09.072 --> 24:10.449
Harvey, where are you? Oh!

24:11.575 --> 24:12.451
Damn it!

24:13.285 --> 24:14.327
[Sabrina grunts]

24:17.664 --> 24:18.498
[Sabrina gasps]

24:19.499 --> 24:21.626
Ms. Wardwell! What are you doing here?

24:22.002 --> 24:24.337
Exactly what I promised your father
I would do.

24:24.421 --> 24:27.299
I'm looking after you,
so you don't come to any harm.

24:27.632 --> 24:29.718
Wait, now you're following me?

24:29.801 --> 24:32.596
These are very dangerous mines, Sabrina.

24:32.679 --> 24:35.390
In the old days, it was believed
that there were tunnels that burrowed

24:35.474 --> 24:38.018
-all the way to--
-Hell. Yes, I know the stories.

24:38.101 --> 24:39.227
That's why I'm here.

24:40.061 --> 24:43.273
-[Wardwell] Is that a trapping stone?
-It's none of your business.

24:43.565 --> 24:44.941
And I thought I made myself clear,

24:45.025 --> 24:47.319
but consider this your third
and final warning.

24:47.402 --> 24:50.280
Next time, I'm going to have to report you
to the High Priest.

24:50.363 --> 24:52.991
-[Harvey shouts] Sabrina! 'Brina!
-Harvey? Harvey!

24:53.074 --> 24:54.910
[shouts] Sabrina, wait! I can help!

24:54.993 --> 24:58.413
-[Harvey panting]
-Harvey? Harvey!

24:59.289 --> 25:03.543
-Harvey, what is it?
-It's here. I saw it. Over there.

25:03.668 --> 25:05.587
[panting]

25:08.423 --> 25:10.509
Harvey, it-- it's just rocks.

25:10.675 --> 25:12.511
[continues panting]

25:18.808 --> 25:22.145
-I dunno, maybe I did--
-Maybe you imagined it, maybe it was real.

25:22.979 --> 25:24.773
And you came down here with me anyway.

25:25.815 --> 25:30.278
And that makes you the bravest,
Harvey Kinkle.

25:32.697 --> 25:34.699
[low growling]

25:36.535 --> 25:38.662
-Can we go?
-Absolutely.

25:39.204 --> 25:42.040
-[Sabrina sighs]
-[Harvey sighs]

25:43.124 --> 25:45.335
-Did you find anything?
-Nothing.

25:46.795 --> 25:48.255
[growling]

25:50.006 --> 25:52.008
I always figured it would come to this.

25:52.717 --> 25:55.220
[doctor] The kind of help
your brother needs, Mr. Putnam,

25:55.512 --> 25:57.597
immediate, round-the-clock care...

25:58.723 --> 26:00.976
that'll be much easier at my facility.

26:01.726 --> 26:03.144
I don't want him suffering.

26:04.604 --> 26:10.485
The last time we spoke, you told me
your brother has always had "demons."

26:11.695 --> 26:14.906
Any specific incidents
I should know about?

26:15.365 --> 26:16.908
[Putnam] There was this one time...

26:16.992 --> 26:19.119
Jesse liked to put on
our mother's dresses.

26:19.995 --> 26:21.955
Us kids would just laugh, you know?

26:23.665 --> 26:25.959
But one time,
our daddy caught him in the act.

26:27.127 --> 26:28.587
Beat him black and blue.

26:29.963 --> 26:32.382
Well, he quit putting on her dresses
after that.

26:34.384 --> 26:36.636
And we always struggled with his, uh...

26:38.096 --> 26:40.265
you know, sexuality.

26:41.349 --> 26:42.726
His proclivities.

26:42.976 --> 26:46.104
You're the one who's sick, girl-boy.

26:46.521 --> 26:48.648
You're the abomination.

26:51.359 --> 26:53.945
What are you saying
all that stuff for, Dad?

26:54.112 --> 26:56.281
What happened in the past
has nothing to do

26:56.364 --> 26:58.366
with what's happening
to Uncle Jesse now!

26:58.450 --> 27:00.785
-Susie.
-Is this your daughter, Mr. Putnam?

27:00.869 --> 27:04.581
You can't send him off to a loony bin
because he put on a dress once.

27:04.914 --> 27:07.042
You don't even know why he did that.

27:08.460 --> 27:11.171
Jesse needs help.
Help we can't give him.

27:13.256 --> 27:14.466
Then I wanna see it.

27:16.593 --> 27:18.720
I wanna see the place where he's gonna go.

27:18.970 --> 27:20.180
Make sure it's...

27:21.640 --> 27:22.974
Make sure it's okay.

27:33.860 --> 27:34.778
[penlight clicks]

27:37.113 --> 27:38.490
[father] What's the good word, doc?

27:39.532 --> 27:40.784
Not much, Reverend.

27:41.618 --> 27:44.120
As with most cases of degenerative myopia,

27:44.204 --> 27:47.624
your daughter's vision loss is progressing
steadily and rapidly.

27:47.707 --> 27:50.460
[father] Last time we were here,
you mentioned a surgery?

27:50.627 --> 27:53.672
[doctor] Yes, a clear lens extraction,
but I want to caution you--

27:53.755 --> 27:55.382
That my chances aren't good.

27:57.133 --> 27:58.134
Are they?

27:59.052 --> 28:01.096
-But if there's any chance--
-Daddy.

28:03.556 --> 28:06.059
-[Roz sighs]
-Will you give us a minute, doc?

28:06.726 --> 28:08.228
Of course. Take your time.

28:12.273 --> 28:13.650
What is it, baby?

28:16.069 --> 28:16.945
Daddy...

28:17.946 --> 28:20.782
do you think
that God could be punishing me?

28:24.619 --> 28:26.079
Punishing you for what?

28:28.540 --> 28:30.583
You say all the time...

28:32.252 --> 28:34.129
Grandma Walker went blind...

28:35.088 --> 28:36.673
because she didn't have faith.

28:36.756 --> 28:40.301
But you're not like her, Rosalind.
You have faith.

28:41.678 --> 28:43.054
[demon growling]

28:48.017 --> 28:48.977
Do I?

28:50.103 --> 28:51.563
I'm not so sure.

28:53.481 --> 28:55.483
[birds chirping]

28:56.443 --> 28:58.445
[Sabrina chuckles softly]
Got you, creep.

28:58.945 --> 29:02.323
-Huh?
-Apophis. His name's Apophis.

29:04.409 --> 29:07.036
If we fuse the pieces together,
can I trap the demon

29:07.120 --> 29:09.080
-like I did the Batibat?
-[hissing softly]

29:11.875 --> 29:14.252
You'll have to get it
out of Jesse Putnam first.

29:15.128 --> 29:17.005
[Ambrose flipping through pages]

29:17.630 --> 29:19.340
Originally, from the time of Homer,

29:19.424 --> 29:23.052
the word "demon" was used to describe
a being of benevolence.

29:23.261 --> 29:26.181
Of course, that meaning has been perverted
by the False Church,

29:26.264 --> 29:29.851
and now carries with it
connotations of malevolence.

29:30.727 --> 29:31.811
Father Blackwood?

29:32.312 --> 29:33.813
Yes, Miss Spellman?

29:34.272 --> 29:36.733
-Can witches perform exorcisms?
-[girls laugh]

29:36.816 --> 29:39.652
Miss Spellman, I'm not sure
what that question has to do with anything

29:39.736 --> 29:42.906
we're discussing in this seminar,
but no, witches may not.

29:42.989 --> 29:45.617
Someone tell Sabrina, please, why that is?

29:45.700 --> 29:47.243
[Prudence]
Exorcisms are a Catholic rite

29:47.702 --> 29:49.954
in which male priests call upon
the False God

29:50.038 --> 29:51.623
for assistance to expel demons.

29:51.706 --> 29:54.501
[Faustus]
Correct. Now, as I was saying,

29:54.584 --> 29:58.671
the ancient Assyrians,
particularly, were--

29:58.755 --> 30:00.423
Yes, Miss Spellman?

30:00.965 --> 30:04.093
My friend's uncle is being possessed
by a demon, Apophis.

30:05.053 --> 30:08.181
What if this brings unwanted attention
to the witches of Greendale?

30:08.515 --> 30:13.186
That's not a concern, as possessions
involving Apophis rarely last long.

30:13.478 --> 30:14.729
Why is that?

30:18.399 --> 30:21.820
[Faustus] Apophis is a parasitic demon,
also known as the Devouring Worm.

30:21.903 --> 30:23.988
He's feasting on your friend's uncle

30:24.072 --> 30:26.449
from the inside out.
If he's alive, he won't be for long.

30:26.741 --> 30:29.410
Then something has to be done, and fast.

30:29.494 --> 30:31.788
[Faustus] No need.
As I said, the mortal will be gone soon.

30:32.121 --> 30:34.999
Where does the demon go then,
once he's done feasting?

30:35.083 --> 30:39.629
I imagine he'll do what all parasites do.
Jump to another warm host.

30:39.712 --> 30:42.966
Usually a body that's already come
into contact with Apophis.

30:43.967 --> 30:45.301
That would be my friends.

30:45.635 --> 30:50.640
So if witches can't perform exorcisms,
then what can they... we do?

30:52.058 --> 30:55.270
-Banish this creep?
-Some demons can be banished.

30:55.353 --> 30:58.106
More tenacious ones,
like the Devouring Worm,

30:58.189 --> 30:59.607
would require an exorcism.

30:59.691 --> 31:04.487
Which, again, witches are not allowed
or able to perform.

31:04.571 --> 31:08.533
-[bell tolling]
-[Faustus] On that note, class dismissed.

31:14.998 --> 31:16.416
-[Nick] Hey.
-[door opens]

31:17.959 --> 31:19.627
-Wanna talk about it?
-What?

31:19.711 --> 31:21.588
-[door closes]
-Whatever's on your mind?

31:22.547 --> 31:26.718
-I wish I could, Nick, but I've got--
-Let me guess... friends to save?

31:27.427 --> 31:29.345
-Demons to exorcise?
-[chuckles]

31:30.597 --> 31:33.683
You're a rebel, Spellman.
That's how I like my witches.

31:34.934 --> 31:38.813
Nicholas, to be clear, I have a boyfriend.

31:40.023 --> 31:43.818
Yes... but you also have two natures.

31:44.485 --> 31:45.820
You go to two schools.

31:47.238 --> 31:48.573
Why not date two guys?

31:50.617 --> 31:51.784
I'm down with sharing.

31:55.038 --> 31:56.748
[Hilda] How was the academy, love?

31:57.665 --> 31:59.125
What are you doing here?

31:59.959 --> 32:01.961
Sabrina, please don't be cross with me.

32:02.545 --> 32:04.547
After our encounter in the mines,

32:05.089 --> 32:07.675
and having recognized the demon Apophis
on that stone,

32:07.759 --> 32:11.304
I became concerned
that you were putting yourself in danger.

32:11.554 --> 32:13.181
Do my aunties know what you are?

32:13.723 --> 32:15.141
I've told them everything.

32:15.558 --> 32:18.061
-And?
-I wish I could say we were surprised,

32:18.144 --> 32:20.521
but this is just like Edward,
isn't it, Hilda?

32:20.855 --> 32:23.066
-[Hilda] Hmm.
-It's insulting, of course,

32:23.149 --> 32:25.985
that he didn't think we'd be up to
the task of protecting you ourselves.

32:26.069 --> 32:28.404
-Well, maybe you aren't.
-I beg your pardon?

32:28.488 --> 32:31.407
Sabrina has been finding herself
in increasingly difficult predicaments

32:31.491 --> 32:33.159
since fleeing her Dark Baptism.

32:33.368 --> 32:35.536
-That is a good point.
-Quiet, Hilda.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.121
Aunties, Ms. Wardwell.

32:37.205 --> 32:39.874
Jesse Putnam is going to die
if we don't do anything!

32:39.958 --> 32:41.751
And my friends will be next.

32:41.834 --> 32:43.711
And if I can't get help
from the Church of Night,

32:43.795 --> 32:45.755
I'll get it from the Catholic church
down the road.

32:45.838 --> 32:47.465
Have you lost your mind?

32:47.548 --> 32:49.425
Turning to the False Church for help?

32:49.509 --> 32:51.970
Has your Aunt Hilda's excommunication
taught you nothing?

32:52.053 --> 32:53.513
I don't see what choice I have.

32:53.596 --> 32:54.973
Father Blackwood said

32:55.056 --> 32:58.226
that there is no exorcism rite
for witches to perform.

32:58.309 --> 33:02.897
Actually, it so happens Edward wrote
a rite expressly for that purpose.

33:03.439 --> 33:06.401
And how, Ms. Wardwell,
is that information at all helpful?

33:06.484 --> 33:08.194
Always thinking outside the box, Edward.

33:08.277 --> 33:11.572
It so happens,
I have a copy of the rite with me.

33:11.656 --> 33:14.575
If Sabrina insists on following
this madness through,

33:14.659 --> 33:17.328
she should be armed
with the proper tools at least.

33:17.412 --> 33:21.708
I'm sorry. Are you actually suggesting
that my niece perform an exorcism?

33:21.791 --> 33:24.043
I stopped by Susie's
on my way home from the academy.

33:24.127 --> 33:26.754
She and her dad aren't there,
so if we act fast--

33:26.838 --> 33:29.173
-She's determined to, it seems.
<i>-</i>[Zelda] You claim

33:29.257 --> 33:32.301
that your entire raison d'être
is to protect Sabrina.

33:32.719 --> 33:33.636
Well, it is.

33:34.095 --> 33:36.180
And I shall be with her, of course.

33:36.264 --> 33:40.601
And at the first sign of danger,
I'll spirit her away.

33:41.060 --> 33:44.147
No. I won't allow it. I forbid it.

33:44.230 --> 33:46.357
Aunt Zelda,
I'm not asking you for permission.

33:46.858 --> 33:51.279
I'm doing it. And if Ms. Wardwell wants
to chaperone me, fine.

33:51.904 --> 33:54.907
But I won't be leaving that room
until Jesse Putnam is free.

33:55.074 --> 33:57.744
It's a good thing
Edward had me looking after you.

33:57.952 --> 34:01.873
Your aunts, it appears, would have
you perform the exorcism alone.

34:02.498 --> 34:04.584
No, not me. [chuckles] I'll go as well.

34:04.667 --> 34:05.501
[Zelda] Hilda!

34:05.585 --> 34:10.006
Need I remind you the Church of Night
expressly forbids performing exorcisms.

34:10.089 --> 34:12.216
Yes, but I'm excommunicated, aren't I?

34:12.300 --> 34:14.802
So, really, what have I got to lose?

34:15.303 --> 34:17.430
[Zelda] Has the entire world gone mad?

34:17.972 --> 34:19.724
None of you are ordained.

34:19.807 --> 34:22.185
Unlike the Catholic exorcism,

34:22.268 --> 34:25.021
which draws its potency
not on the priest performing it,

34:25.104 --> 34:26.689
but from the False God,

34:26.773 --> 34:30.985
Edward's rite relies on the power
of the individual witch

34:31.694 --> 34:33.196
challenging the demon,

34:33.279 --> 34:39.202
and on the continuum of...
witches that predates us all.

34:39.869 --> 34:42.747
Well, in that case, Ms. Wardwell,
what are we waiting for?

34:43.081 --> 34:46.793
Sabrina, you can't possibly trust
this stranger, can you?

34:46.876 --> 34:48.961
I don't see what other choice I have,
Aunt Zee.

35:28.459 --> 35:31.212
I ran Lady Blackwood's urine sample
for you, Auntie Zee.

35:32.588 --> 35:33.798
Interesting results.

35:33.881 --> 35:37.051
For the love of Satan, what have I done
to deserve these women in my life?

35:37.135 --> 35:38.886
-You're lucky, I suppose.
-[Zelda huffs]

35:38.970 --> 35:43.182
I refuse to put the safety of my niece
in the hands of a spinster schoolmarm

35:43.266 --> 35:45.184
and a British batwit.

35:45.977 --> 35:47.562
[sighs] They'll get her killed.

35:49.897 --> 35:51.649
Not if you help her, they won't.

36:00.575 --> 36:02.410
[demon rasping]

36:05.329 --> 36:06.831
[demon] How lovely.

36:07.373 --> 36:08.749
You're back.

36:10.418 --> 36:12.837
And you brought your friends.

36:13.254 --> 36:17.216
Three little piggies, all pink and plump

36:17.300 --> 36:19.218
and ripe for eating.

36:19.302 --> 36:21.929
-Hush, demon.
-I went to the mines last night.

36:22.180 --> 36:24.056
And found out your real name.

36:24.682 --> 36:27.268
[all] Apophis. Devouring Worm.

36:27.351 --> 36:28.728
demon grunts]

36:29.562 --> 36:32.481
The Putnams could return at any moment.
We should begin.

36:33.024 --> 36:35.443
There's nothing you can do.

36:35.526 --> 36:39.989
-You have no authority over me, witches.
-Speak with a loud, clear voice, Sabrina.

36:40.448 --> 36:41.490
Always.

36:41.574 --> 36:44.118
[demon growling]

36:45.953 --> 36:48.372
We call forth the witches from the shade.

36:48.456 --> 36:51.626
Those who came before us,
and died, so that we might live.

36:51.709 --> 36:54.545
[all] Visit us, Sisters.
Intercede on our behalf.

36:54.629 --> 36:55.922
-[fire whooshes]
-That's rich.

36:56.380 --> 37:00.092
You're not even a witch,
barely a half-witch.

37:00.176 --> 37:02.929
I call forth the powers
of Lilith of Aradia,

37:03.012 --> 37:04.222
of Morgan le Fay.

37:04.722 --> 37:06.682
Visit us, Sisters.
Intercede on our behalf.

37:06.766 --> 37:10.394
I'm going to eat
all your little friends, one by one.

37:10.478 --> 37:12.188
I call on Black Annis,
I call on Anne Boleyn.

37:12.271 --> 37:14.523

37:20.571 --> 37:24.700
I call on Hecate, on Artemis,
on Luna to expel this demon.

37:24.784 --> 37:28.037
Expel Apophis.
Return him to the Dark Lord.

Visit us, Sisters.
Intercede on our behalf.

37:30.623 --> 37:33.501

It's not working.

37:47.431 --> 37:48.599
Keep going.

37:48.683 --> 37:50.893
Energies are gathering, you can feel them.

37:51.269 --> 37:52.895
Keep going! Keep going! Keep going!

Don't listen to it.

38:01.779 --> 38:03.990
-Psychological attacks.
-You're a polluted thing.

38:04.073 --> 38:07.535
I call on Juventas, the virgin,
on Juno, the mother--

38:08.077 --> 38:10.955
Your parents died because of you.

38:11.038 --> 38:13.499
Because you're an impure half-breed.

38:13.582 --> 38:17.003
-[thunder rumbles]
-Lend us your power. Expel the demon.

38:17.586 --> 38:19.505
Visit us, Sisters.
Intercede on our behalf.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.924
Something's wrong. I'm not strong enough.

Yes, you are. I call upon Cybil Leek.

38:25.386 --> 38:27.930
I call upon Priscilla Spellman.

38:28.014 --> 38:30.599
I call upon Francis Spellman.

38:30.683 --> 38:33.811
I call upon Evanora and Locasta Spellman.

38:33.894 --> 38:34.895
Continue, Sabrina.

38:35.354 --> 38:38.733
Come forth, Kindly Ones.
Come forth, Mother of Darkness.

38:38.983 --> 38:42.111
Lend us your power.
Expel the demon Apophis!

39:03.591 --> 39:06.844
[pants, stammering] Is it-- Is it over?

39:08.012 --> 39:09.013
[Wardwell] I don't know.

39:09.096 --> 39:11.724
[demon growling]

39:12.516 --> 39:13.601
Sabrina, don't.

39:16.520 --> 39:19.065
Apophis, Devouring Worm.

39:20.566 --> 39:21.692
[softly] Now what?

39:21.776 --> 39:23.778
[demon growling]

39:39.126 --> 39:41.128
[grunts] The stone seal, Sabrina.

39:41.212 --> 39:45.257
-[Sabrina panting]
-[water splashing]

39:48.844 --> 39:51.597
And you really don't think
it can get back up, Ms. Wardwell?

39:51.680 --> 39:54.642
Not with that seal in there.
And not in the state it was in.

39:54.725 --> 39:58.813
No, that worm will burrow its way
back to hell where it belongs.

40:00.689 --> 40:02.108
What about Uncle Jesse?

40:03.109 --> 40:04.193
[Hilda] Unconscious.

40:04.443 --> 40:09.907
He'll be weak for a while, I imagine.
But he's alive, thanks to you. [sighs]

40:10.324 --> 40:11.534
Thanks to all of us.

40:12.493 --> 40:13.869
Including you, Aunt Zee.

40:15.162 --> 40:16.747
What made you change your mind?

40:17.248 --> 40:20.126
The first witch exorcism ever performed.

40:20.626 --> 40:23.462
That seemed like something
I should witness first-hand.

40:23.712 --> 40:25.589
If only for educational purposes.

40:26.132 --> 40:29.760
But don't get too big for your britches,
Sabrina. You're grounded.

40:29.844 --> 40:30.970
Grounded?

40:31.053 --> 40:34.056
A mortal punishment
for interfering with mortal affairs.

40:35.224 --> 40:38.269
Don't know about you three, but I could do
with a nice, hot cup of tea.

40:38.352 --> 40:40.187
Oh, yes. Let's go home.

40:40.855 --> 40:43.065
Ms. Wardwell, will you join us?

40:43.649 --> 40:47.027
[chuckles] Oh, no, no.
I've intruded enough for one day.

40:48.195 --> 40:50.573
-I should go.
-I think that's best, yes.

40:51.907 --> 40:54.827
But I'll see you bright and early
in the morning for homeroom.

40:56.328 --> 40:57.455
Ms. Wardwell?

41:01.459 --> 41:02.418
Thank you.

41:15.764 --> 41:16.682
[Ambrose] <i>Aunties?</i>

41:17.641 --> 41:18.642
We have company.

41:19.393 --> 41:23.230
Father Blackwood.
To what do we owe the honor of this visit?

41:23.314 --> 41:26.692
It has come to my attention,
Sister Zelda, that you, Sabrina,

41:26.775 --> 41:31.572
and your excommunicated sister have
just performed an unauthorized exorcism.

41:32.031 --> 41:34.783
Word travels fast
amongst the damned, it seems.

41:34.867 --> 41:37.953
For the record, I did not inform him.
His Excellency had an inkling and...

41:38.037 --> 41:39.330
humbled us with a visit.

41:39.413 --> 41:42.708
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't
excommunicate the pack of you.

41:42.791 --> 41:43.834
I can give you two.

41:43.918 --> 41:47.421
Earlier today, I received the results
of your wife's tests.

41:48.297 --> 41:50.508
Congratulations, Father Blackwood.

41:50.925 --> 41:52.676
Constance is expecting twins.

41:53.427 --> 41:56.555
-Twins?
-[Zelda] Yes, it's good news.

41:56.847 --> 41:59.892
However, it may be a difficult pregnancy.

41:59.975 --> 42:03.103
Not to worry, though,
I'll be tending to her every need.

42:03.187 --> 42:05.397
Unless, of course, you feel I, or...

42:06.065 --> 42:10.611
any members of my family,
are unworthy... in some way.

42:15.908 --> 42:17.910
[birds chirping]

42:19.578 --> 42:22.456
-[Hilda] Hey. What's the matter, love?
-Nothing.

42:22.540 --> 42:23.916
Just my melancholia.

42:23.999 --> 42:25.751
-What happened now?
-[Ambrose] Nothing.

42:26.335 --> 42:28.170
Nothing's happened, which is the problem.

42:28.337 --> 42:31.215
You, Auntie Zee, Sabrina,
you three performed an exorcism.

42:31.298 --> 42:34.718
Meantime, I was sat here trapped,
doing jack all.

42:36.554 --> 42:39.932
While I was with Father Blackwood,
I asked him about commuting my sentence.

42:40.015 --> 42:41.183
He did not give me hope.

42:41.475 --> 42:47.356
Perhaps you could try calling that nice,
handsome young lad you dated.

42:47.439 --> 42:50.109
-Luke something or other.
-Luke Chalfant.

42:50.192 --> 42:51.193
[Hilda] Hmm.

42:51.277 --> 42:52.736
[Ambrose] I have called him.

42:53.195 --> 42:55.155
-Repeatedly.
-Oh.

42:55.656 --> 42:56.907
He hasn't called me back.

42:57.992 --> 42:59.493
[phone ringing]

42:59.868 --> 43:01.870
Hang on. Um, sorry.

43:03.664 --> 43:05.332
[sighs deeply]

43:07.251 --> 43:09.169
[Hilda] Spellman Sisters Mortuary,
how may I assist you?

43:09.837 --> 43:11.046
Oh, Mr. Putnam!

43:13.632 --> 43:15.050
I'm so sorry to hear that.

43:18.220 --> 43:21.807
Yeah. Of course. Just come when you can,
and we'll be here.

43:28.272 --> 43:29.523
Wait, what happened?

43:31.066 --> 43:32.234
Jesse passed.

43:33.485 --> 43:37.823
Sometime during the night.
His-- His poor heart gave out.

43:39.658 --> 43:40.492
Oh, no.

43:42.453 --> 43:43.287
[sighs]

43:45.873 --> 43:48.459
I'm so sorry about your uncle, Susie.

43:49.460 --> 43:50.794
Really. I...

43:52.588 --> 43:53.881
I can't believe it.

43:56.175 --> 43:59.219
My dad and I visited the place
where we were gonna send him.

43:59.428 --> 44:00.471
The asylum.

44:02.348 --> 44:04.975
Honestly, maybe it's better.

44:05.184 --> 44:07.645
He would've rotted in there.

44:08.729 --> 44:09.813
At least...

44:11.607 --> 44:13.359
At least he's free now.

44:15.069 --> 44:15.944
You know?

44:17.488 --> 44:18.489
I guess so.

44:21.075 --> 44:23.952
Susie, I don't think I've ever seen you
in a dress before.

44:25.996 --> 44:27.998
[Susie breathes deeply]

44:28.666 --> 44:32.002
[voice trembles] I'm not an abomination,
Sabrina, and I won't be one.

44:33.087 --> 44:34.004
What?

44:36.507 --> 44:39.760
Of course not. Why...
Why are you saying that?

44:40.386 --> 44:42.638
Forget it. It doesn't matter.

44:54.692 --> 44:55.943
[door bell chimes]

44:57.820 --> 44:59.571
Hi, darling. What can I get you?

44:59.655 --> 45:03.117
I'd like a medium latte, please.

45:03.200 --> 45:04.743
And, um, what's your name?

45:04.827 --> 45:05.828
Luke.

45:06.120 --> 45:07.830
-[door bell chimes]
-[Hilda] Uh...

45:08.956 --> 45:09.832
And your surname?

45:11.500 --> 45:14.920
-Chalfant.
-That's brilliant. [chuckles]

45:15.546 --> 45:16.755
Coming right up.

45:18.298 --> 45:20.426
Mr. Luke Chalfant.

45:23.429 --> 45:25.848
"Always prepared,"

45:26.056 --> 45:28.726
that's the witch's motto.

45:31.270 --> 45:33.313
[Sabrina]
What does it all matter, Ms. Wardwell,

45:33.397 --> 45:35.691
if, in the end,
I couldn't save Uncle Jesse?

45:37.192 --> 45:38.193
But you did.

45:38.944 --> 45:40.237
You saved his soul.

45:41.029 --> 45:44.491
That might not feel like a victory
at this point, but it is one.

45:45.284 --> 45:48.036
Apophis ravaged him to the point of death.

45:48.954 --> 45:53.083
With mere hours to spare,
you... brought him peace.

45:54.877 --> 45:56.420
Made him whole again.

45:56.920 --> 45:57.796
Did I?

45:59.339 --> 46:01.508
We've no reason to believe otherwise.

46:02.217 --> 46:04.219
[clapping]

46:09.600 --> 46:12.728
Bravo, Jesse Putnam, bravo.

46:12.811 --> 46:16.523
You played your part
in this passion play beautifully.

46:19.610 --> 46:20.694
And now...

46:21.820 --> 46:23.155
After your...

46:25.115 --> 46:26.200
ordeal...

46:27.409 --> 46:31.371
take comfort in the fact
that you served a greater purpose.

46:32.623 --> 46:33.582
Purpose?

46:33.749 --> 46:36.627
Well, she had to perform an exorcism
on a mortal.

46:37.419 --> 46:40.339
Part of the Dark Lord's grand design.

46:44.718 --> 46:45.677
[Jesse] I don't...

46:47.846 --> 46:49.473
-[stammers] Who?
-[Wardwell sighs]

46:51.308 --> 46:52.643
Such a pity...

46:53.727 --> 46:56.313
you won't be around
to see the prophecy fulfilled.

46:58.065 --> 47:00.943
I'm sure it will be apocalyptic.

47:03.028 --> 47:06.615
-But your poor, weak, feeble heart...
-[Jesse groans]

47:07.241 --> 47:09.284
...couldn't handle the strain, could it?

47:09.576 --> 47:11.578
-[groaning continues]
-[bones cracking]

47:13.372 --> 47:17.501
[softly] It was all just too much for you.

47:18.293 --> 47:19.837
-[bones crack]
-[groans cease]

47:25.634 --> 47:27.636
[footsteps receding]

47:32.891 --> 47:36.144
I just... I can't help it.

47:38.063 --> 47:39.523
I feel like I failed.

47:44.069 --> 47:46.989
I mean, how am I ever going to outwit
the Dark Lord?

47:49.116 --> 47:52.578
Outwit the Dark Lord?

47:54.746 --> 47:58.000
Why, Sabrina...

48:00.961 --> 48:02.629
whatever do you mean?

48:08.844 --> 48:10.762
[theme music playing]

49:08.904 --> 49:10.322
[man] <i>Brett, move your head.</i>
