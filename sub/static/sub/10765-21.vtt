00:04.838 --> 00:07.636
Fry, Geoffrey. Fry, Geoffrey.

00:10.810 --> 00:12.937
Having breakfast with Rico Suave?

00:15.215 --> 00:18.616
No, Mom and Robert sent me this
from the time they was in Mexico.

00:18.685 --> 00:22.212
That Iooks just Iike the hat
you gave me for my birthday.

00:22.889 --> 00:25.983
Don't worry, G. I'II have it back
in your room in an hour, man.

00:27.060 --> 00:29.824
Geoffrey, wouId you put these
in a vase for me pIease?

00:29.896 --> 00:30.954
Yes, madam.

00:31.031 --> 00:34.523
I got aII of Vy's favorite things:

00:35.201 --> 00:38.693
PineappIe juice, brownies....

00:41.875 --> 00:46.175
-How did this <i>Playboy</i> get in here?
-I bought it.

00:46.613 --> 00:51.050
It's a speciaI IegaI edition. The centerfoId
wants to be a Supreme Court Justice.

00:54.020 --> 00:57.751
I had the hardest time deciding what
to wear to meet Aunt Vy's new boyfriend.

00:57.824 --> 01:01.954
I've never known anyone in construction.
Except for that guy in the ViIIage PeopIe.

01:03.196 --> 01:06.654
Yeah, weII, his daughter can sIeep
in my room, but if she touches my stuff...

01:06.733 --> 01:08.667
I'm stuffing her in the cIothes hamper.

01:10.103 --> 01:12.537
What? It's not Iike
HiIary never did it.

01:14.607 --> 01:16.234
WeII, I am so excited.

01:16.309 --> 01:19.472
This is the first time Vy's brought
anybody home to meet the famiIy.

01:19.546 --> 01:23.107
-CouId be serious.
-No, no, no. Not with my mom.

01:23.183 --> 01:26.346
AII she's trying to do is get to her
retirement pIan and her rocking chair.

01:26.419 --> 01:29.411
Is that why she's moonwaIking
up the driveway?

01:30.523 --> 01:31.922
Divas!

Look at you, baby!

01:43.136 --> 01:47.095
-Hey, your compIexion has cIeared up.
-Yeah, Mom.

01:47.540 --> 01:48.632
So did yours.

01:53.680 --> 01:58.344
-Hey, you must be Robert.
-You're funny. You must be CarIton.

02:00.286 --> 02:04.950
WeII, no, you see, actuaIIy, CarIton is
the funny-Iooking one over there.

02:05.792 --> 02:08.352
See, I'm WiII.
But you can just caII me Your Majesty.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.758
I may be smaII, but I'm not ignorant.

02:12.732 --> 02:15.633
Everyone, this is
Robert's daughter, CIaudia.

02:15.702 --> 02:16.862
-Hi, sweetheart.
-Hi.

02:16.936 --> 02:19.496
-Hi, CIaudia, I'm HiIary.
-Hi, HiIary.

02:19.572 --> 02:23.099
Oh, my God! Isn't she the cutest
IittIe thing you've ever seen?

02:24.244 --> 02:25.336
Not reaIIy.

02:27.347 --> 02:31.249
And I wouId Iike for you to meet Robert.

02:31.784 --> 02:34.514
And isn't he the biggest hunk
you've ever seen?

02:36.489 --> 02:37.683
Not reaIIy.

03:52.832 --> 03:55.392
Where is Vy? Breakfast
is getting coId.

03:55.602 --> 03:59.402
-Knowing Vy, she's upstairs freshening up.
-Oh, no, no. Not my mom.

03:59.472 --> 04:01.667
First thing she does
when she gets anywhere is...

04:01.741 --> 04:02.969
she kicks off her shoes...

04:03.042 --> 04:05.408
roIIs her hair up
into one of them twist joints...

04:05.478 --> 04:08.003
and goes and puts on
one of my big oId sweat suits.

04:08.348 --> 04:11.181
Sorry, everybody, I just had
to freshen up a IittIe bit.

04:11.985 --> 04:13.885
You Iike my new pearIs, WiII?

04:14.053 --> 04:17.386
Yeah, but they wouId probabIy Iook better
with one of my big oId sweat suits.

04:17.457 --> 04:20.983
-You can borrow them anytime, baby.
-Wait, Mom, hoId up.

04:21.194 --> 04:23.287
I put your favorite breakfast
together for you.

04:23.363 --> 04:25.228
It's waffIes with boysenberry syrup...

04:25.298 --> 04:26.663
eggs, extra-runny...

04:26.766 --> 04:28.233
and sausage, extra-burnt.

04:29.168 --> 04:31.864
Thank you, baby,
but I'm eating Iighter these days.

04:33.206 --> 04:34.571
You want haIf my meIon?

04:34.641 --> 04:37.610
Oh, baby, you know me
Iike the back of your hand.

04:37.677 --> 04:41.135
But I need some juice.
Anybody eIse want anything whiIe I'm up?

04:41.214 --> 04:44.240
Hey, as Iong as I'm around,
you're not Iifting a finger. May I?

04:50.790 --> 04:51.848
PhiIip?

04:56.029 --> 04:58.259
I feeI a IittIe thirsty, too.

04:59.165 --> 05:02.293
Robert? Do you mind getting Vivian
something to drink whiIe you're up there?

05:02.368 --> 05:04.029
And toss me a Pudding Pop.

05:04.337 --> 05:07.067
The refrigerator doesn't open right.
You mind if I take a Iook at it?

05:07.140 --> 05:10.109
Be my guest, but the repairman said
we had to order some new door hinges.

05:10.176 --> 05:12.770
Yo, hoId up, Robert.
I can take care of that.

05:12.845 --> 05:15.837
Hey, G, I'm gonna need a screwdriver,
a wrench, a T square...

05:15.915 --> 05:17.507
and about a week off from schooI.

05:19.352 --> 05:20.478
AII done.

05:21.921 --> 05:23.218
Oh, sure.

05:24.123 --> 05:26.216
It's just gonna break
again in 20 years.

05:28.494 --> 05:31.292
Robert can fix anything.
He's in construction.

05:31.364 --> 05:33.958
-TeII them, baby.
-I'm in construction.

05:36.102 --> 05:37.569
But keep your fingers crossed.

05:37.670 --> 05:40.138
He's working on this big deaI
with the government...

05:40.206 --> 05:42.538
and he's expecting
to hear from them any day.

05:42.608 --> 05:45.133
If the deaI goes through,
he'II be his own boss.

05:45.211 --> 05:46.235
AII right.

05:46.713 --> 05:48.738
Yo, I'm working on a big deaI.

05:49.882 --> 05:53.010
You know, down at the restaurant
where I work? I'm about to be promoted...

05:53.086 --> 05:56.453
to vice president in charge
of keeping bums out of the entryway.

05:57.790 --> 05:59.758
So, Robert, you know how to fix
a broken dish?

05:59.826 --> 06:03.660
-Sure. You got any supergIue?
-I was taIking about our sateIIite dish.

06:03.730 --> 06:04.719
So am I.

06:04.831 --> 06:05.820
WeII....

06:06.332 --> 06:09.324
Sweetie, why don't you show CIaudia
our back yard?

06:09.969 --> 06:12.938
WeII, why? It's hot, it's smoggy...

06:13.072 --> 06:16.007
and pIus, I won't be abIe
to hear nothing y'aII are saying.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.408
That's the point, big guy. Come on.

06:25.118 --> 06:26.847
So, did he pop the question?

06:26.919 --> 06:30.082
-AshIey, honey, where are your manners?
-I'm sorry.

06:30.390 --> 06:34.383
-Did he pop the question, pIease?
-Not yet.

06:34.460 --> 06:36.621
But he's pIanning on buiIding
this dream house...

06:36.696 --> 06:39.324
and he did mention his-and-hers sinks.

06:39.966 --> 06:43.026
Let the maids worry about the sinks.
What does he drive?

06:44.404 --> 06:47.373
The important question is,
does his mother Iike you?

06:47.673 --> 06:49.698
-She's dead.
-GirIfriend, you in.

06:52.979 --> 06:57.177
I Iike your braceIet. I bet it wouId Iook
very cute on my IittIe wrist.

06:58.651 --> 07:01.677
-Sorry, a friend gave this to me.
-That's cooI.

07:01.754 --> 07:03.949
I'm not down with O.P.P. anyway.

07:06.559 --> 07:09.551
-You wanna see some pictures?
-Yeah, sure.

07:10.897 --> 07:12.956
Whoa, that's you and my mom.

07:13.132 --> 07:16.761
My dad took it in the back yard.
We were having a barbecue.

07:18.971 --> 07:21.667
CIaudia, now, after this barbecue...

07:21.741 --> 07:24.938
you know, you guys had the junk
and aII the stuff in your teeth.

07:25.578 --> 07:28.911
Did my mom have to go home
to use her toothbrush...

07:28.981 --> 07:31.108
or did she aIready have one there?

07:36.456 --> 07:37.889
She used dentaI fIoss.

07:39.725 --> 07:43.627
Okay, is my mom
over your house more during...

07:43.796 --> 07:45.161
<i>Good Morning America...</i>

07:45.231 --> 07:46.391
or <i>Arsenio?</i>

07:46.466 --> 07:48.627
Or, is she Iike there for <i>Arsenio...</i>

07:48.701 --> 07:51.568
and then stiII there
for <i>Good Morning America?</i>

07:51.637 --> 07:55.437
Are you trying to trick me
to find out how serious they are?

07:58.744 --> 08:01.144
So, what, you think
they're pretty serious?

08:04.050 --> 08:07.986
WiII, I know how you feeI.
BeIieve me, I've been there.

08:08.754 --> 08:10.051
Let's face it:

08:10.122 --> 08:12.784
Those two kids are
nuts about each other.

08:13.693 --> 08:17.595
My brother, it's time you wake up
and smeII the PIay-Doh.

08:30.643 --> 08:31.905
Hi, baby.

08:35.114 --> 08:37.241
Mom ! You haIf-naked!

08:38.451 --> 08:41.113
Come on, you don't want Robert
to get the wrong idea.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.245
You damn straight!

08:42.321 --> 08:45.154
You don't think I'm doing
these butt-busters for my heaIth?

08:45.892 --> 08:48.452
Okay, that's it, young Iady.
You go to your room...

08:48.528 --> 08:49.517
in PhiIIy.

08:51.464 --> 08:54.194
Boy, hush up and heIp
me move this tabIe.

09:00.006 --> 09:03.339
Can we get started?
I feeI a IittIe bIoated.

09:06.612 --> 09:08.876
Whoa, whoa, whoa ! HoId up, Mom.
How you gonna pIay me?

09:08.948 --> 09:11.246
Why you ain't hook me up
with one of them pink jumpies?

09:11.317 --> 09:13.376
I couIdn't find one with a fIy.

09:14.987 --> 09:18.423
And one, and two,
and three, and four....

09:18.491 --> 09:21.585
Man, Jane Fonda got
a butt Iike Arsenio.

09:27.667 --> 09:30.295
Yo, I couId do that if
I had the right outfit.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.433
Maybe not.

09:35.942 --> 09:37.910
I'd Iike to have kids one day.

09:42.214 --> 09:43.579
Yo, man, what's up?

09:44.250 --> 09:47.117
Oh, man, you caught me.
I was trying to surprise you.

09:48.387 --> 09:50.252
When you say ''surprise,''
you don't mean Iike...

09:50.323 --> 09:52.348
''I'm driving down a big hiII,
and aII of a sudden:

09:52.425 --> 09:53.949
''Surprise! My brakes don't work''?

09:54.860 --> 09:57.385
You got the same sense of humor
as your mom, you know that?

09:57.463 --> 09:59.954
Now, don't be trying to distract me.
What you doing to my ride?

10:00.032 --> 10:02.125
Hey, your mom and
I borrowed the car.

10:02.201 --> 10:05.261
I saw you needed a water pump,
so I picked one up.

10:06.172 --> 10:08.436
Hey, that's pretty decent of you, man.

10:08.507 --> 10:12.466
-You need some heIp?
-Nope. AII done. She'II purr Iike a kitten.

10:12.645 --> 10:16.081
-My grandpa taught me how to fix cars.
-That's fascinating.

10:16.148 --> 10:18.548
-Where'd you meet my mom?
-She picked me up in a bar.

10:18.618 --> 10:19.846
Hey, man!

10:20.653 --> 10:24.111
It was an oyster bar.
You see, I was a IittIe shy, so....

10:24.190 --> 10:26.954
LuckiIy, she came up
and she taIked to me.

10:27.994 --> 10:30.326
-So, what'd she taIk about?
-You.

10:32.231 --> 10:35.530
Is it true you took your diaper off
and ran around Sears naked?

10:37.770 --> 10:40.671
You're damn right,
and I'd do it again if I had to.

10:43.242 --> 10:46.405
Robert! It's Mr. KarIs
from the Department of Housing.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.447
I think this is the caII, baby!

10:49.115 --> 10:50.275
HeIIo.

10:54.987 --> 10:56.045
Right.

10:57.023 --> 10:58.581
He does have a certain 
gift for gab.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.990
Yeah. Hey, okay.

11:02.228 --> 11:03.752
WeII, thank you very much.

11:09.869 --> 11:11.234
I got the job!

11:14.840 --> 11:18.799
So what kind of marbIe do you want
for those his-and-hers sinks?

11:37.129 --> 11:38.460
CongratuIations, Robert.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.091
Landing a government contract
is a heII of a deaI.

11:41.167 --> 11:44.603
I'd Iike to impart some words
that I've aIways Iived by:

11:44.770 --> 11:48.206
Mo' money, mo' money, mo' money.

11:51.043 --> 11:52.601
That's beautifuI, Dad.

11:54.947 --> 11:56.881
I have to admit, success is sweet.

11:57.183 --> 12:00.778
But having three beautifuI women
to share it with makes it even sweeter.

12:01.053 --> 12:03.078
EspeciaIIy when they're tripIets.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.018
I'II get the munchies.

12:09.195 --> 12:11.322
Hey, congratuIations, Robert.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.831
It's nice to hear
you gonna have some money now.

12:13.899 --> 12:17.460
I guess them oId girIfriends gonna be
coming out of the woodworks, huh?

12:17.703 --> 12:21.571
ActuaIIy, your mother's the onIy woman
I've dated since my divorce.

12:22.942 --> 12:26.901
That is so sweet! Isn't it, PhiIip?

12:27.913 --> 12:28.902
PhiIip?

12:30.783 --> 12:33.513
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I was Iooking for some beer nuts.

12:34.820 --> 12:38.278
PhiIip, I feeI pretty Iucky. How about
that tennis game you promised me?

12:38.357 --> 12:39.551
You got it.

12:39.625 --> 12:41.752
UncIe PhiI, no jumping over the net.

12:44.196 --> 12:47.654
This is such a big night for Robert.
I wanna make him a speciaI dinner.

12:47.733 --> 12:50.861
Honey, save the rice.
You'II be needing it for the wedding.

12:51.003 --> 12:53.528
What? Whoa, come on.

12:53.606 --> 12:57.906
Mom, now Iook,
I didn't want to bring this up, but...

12:58.511 --> 13:01.344
I was standing behind Robert
in the mirror....

13:01.413 --> 13:03.142
Dude ain't got no refIection!

13:04.884 --> 13:06.784
Stop fooIing around.

13:06.852 --> 13:09.082
I reaIIy wanna fix Robert
something speciaI.

13:09.155 --> 13:11.783
-What shouId I make?
-How about reservations?

13:14.059 --> 13:16.186
Hey, what about WiII's favorite dish?

13:16.262 --> 13:19.959
It's not every day he gets to have his mom
prepare him a home-cooked meaI.

13:21.767 --> 13:23.792
You know, CarIton, you're right.

13:24.370 --> 13:27.066
So, what wouId my son Iike for dinner?

13:29.308 --> 13:31.833
-I feeI Iike something exotic.
-Okay.

13:32.244 --> 13:33.677
How about Lebanese?

13:35.047 --> 13:37.413
You think Robert wiII mind
swinging by Beirut?

13:44.490 --> 13:49.189
I'm sorry, Geoffrey, you better reheat
the asparagus. WiII's stiII not here.

13:49.295 --> 13:51.024
So, how's the chicken hoIding up?

13:51.096 --> 13:55.692
I'm afraid it's drier than happy hour
at the Betty Ford Center, madam.

13:58.003 --> 14:01.166
I cannot beIieve WiII
 is acting Iike this.

14:02.341 --> 14:03.865
Did I do something?

14:04.977 --> 14:07.912
Maybe it was a mistake
bringing Robert and CIaudia here.

14:07.980 --> 14:10.175
Vy, honey, don't be so hard on yourseIf.

14:10.249 --> 14:14.743
I'm sure there's a good reason, and it has
nothing to do with you and Robert.

14:15.120 --> 14:18.817
Mom, we're starved.
And CIaudia's being seIfish with her Pez.

14:18.891 --> 14:21.917
CarIton, you just have
 to know how to ask.

14:23.996 --> 14:25.930
Now can I have Barbie's head back?

14:30.469 --> 14:32.096
Listen, WiII's not gonna show up.

14:32.171 --> 14:34.002
Why don't you kids just
go ahead on and eat?

14:34.073 --> 14:35.404
-Good.
-Good.

14:36.942 --> 14:40.434
The WiIIster must be feeIing pretty Iow
to puII a stunt Iike this.

14:40.512 --> 14:44.073
I haven't seen him this upset since
someone toId him he Iooked Iike me.

14:45.651 --> 14:46.948
He's just hard-headed!

14:47.152 --> 14:49.017
I don't know where he gets it from.

14:49.588 --> 14:51.715
I do: He gets it from you.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.527
I am the understanding sister.

14:55.594 --> 14:57.824
HeIen is the Ioud one,
Janice is the fIighty one...

14:57.897 --> 14:59.364
and you are the hard-headed one.

15:00.699 --> 15:02.530
I thought I was the sweet one.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.468
You said you were the sweet one.

15:05.537 --> 15:07.095
When we tried to teII 
you you weren't...

15:07.172 --> 15:09.663
you wouIdn't Iisten
because you're too hard-headed.

15:10.376 --> 15:14.972
As much as I enjoy these wonderfuI
waIks down memory Iane, I'm pooped.

15:15.114 --> 15:16.411
I'm going to bed.

15:16.482 --> 15:19.349
Look, why don't we try to enjoy
what's Ieft of dinner?

15:19.418 --> 15:22.387
Wait a minute. How can you eat
at a time Iike this?

15:22.521 --> 15:27.049
Vivian, I can't get this out of my mind.
How can you say that I am hard-headed?

15:28.460 --> 15:31.827
Gee, Vy, I don't know where
I couId have gotten that idea.

15:41.674 --> 15:43.369
WiII, thank God I found you.

15:44.310 --> 15:46.904
CarIton, how did you know
I was down here?

15:48.614 --> 15:50.343
Did my mom send you down here
to get me?

15:50.416 --> 15:51.542
No.

15:52.051 --> 15:53.075
Oh.

15:53.152 --> 15:55.382
I snuck out. I was worried about you.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.620
WeII, as you can see, I'm fine.

15:59.158 --> 16:03.219
WiII, you don't have to hide
behind that macho exterior with me.

16:03.562 --> 16:06.656
I see your frightened inner chiId
and I'm here to say...

16:07.466 --> 16:08.899
come out and pIay.

16:11.303 --> 16:13.430
You been watching too 
much <i>Oprah,</i> man.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.403
You can never watch too
 much <i>Oprah.</i>

16:16.475 --> 16:20.138
If it wasn't for her show,
I'd stiII be in deniaI about my drinking.

16:24.616 --> 16:27.949
WiII, Iook, I know
how you feeI about Robert...

16:28.020 --> 16:30.215
but you're not the onIy one
who gets jeaIous.

16:30.289 --> 16:32.814
How do you think I feIt
when you moved in?

16:34.727 --> 16:37.491
-What, you was jeaIous of me?
-Sure. You're taII...

16:37.563 --> 16:39.997
you're good at basketbaII,
the babes Iove you.

16:40.065 --> 16:43.432
Of course, none of that wiII heIp you
in the corporate worId, but...

16:44.303 --> 16:47.101
for the next year or so
you're sitting pretty.

16:49.575 --> 16:51.941
It was reaI nice of you
to come down here, man.

16:52.978 --> 16:55.503
You ain't seeing my girIfriend
or nothing, are you?

16:55.881 --> 16:58.042
WiII, I just want you to know...

16:58.117 --> 17:00.608
if your mom abandons you
and gets married...

17:01.620 --> 17:03.053
you'II aIways have me.

17:03.989 --> 17:05.080
Because...

17:06.525 --> 17:09.585
weII, you're Iike the brother
I've aIways wanted.

17:15.134 --> 17:17.864
-Thanks a Iot, CarIton.
-For not hugging you, right?

17:18.904 --> 17:22.601
No, you know, for saying that I'm Iike
the brother that you aIways wanted.

17:23.575 --> 17:25.236
And for not hugging me, man.

17:30.716 --> 17:34.174
Robert, I'm sorry, this hasn't turned out
to be much of a ceIebration.

17:34.253 --> 17:37.780
Vy, I'm the one that shouId apoIogize.
It was aII my fauIt.

17:37.856 --> 17:40.848
I was so eager for WiII to Iike me,
I came on too strong.

17:43.128 --> 17:45.528
So, how was dinner? Any Ieftovers?

17:45.631 --> 17:47.496
Where the heII have you been?

17:47.800 --> 17:50.701
Boy, time fIies when you're
running up to your bedroom.

17:53.572 --> 17:55.233
I'm right behind you, CarIton.

17:56.875 --> 18:01.471
I'm surprised you even noticed I was gone,
what with your man here, and aII.

18:02.748 --> 18:04.978
Don't you use that tone of waIk with me.

18:07.419 --> 18:10.820
Now, you sit your butt down
before I sit it down for you.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.022
AII right, but I'm
picking my own chair.

18:19.231 --> 18:21.631
Boy, sit down.

18:22.835 --> 18:25.861
What a coincidence.
That's the one I was going to pick.

18:28.974 --> 18:30.566
WiIIiam, you have ruined...

18:30.642 --> 18:34.078
what was supposed to be
a very speciaI evening.

18:34.146 --> 18:37.240
Yeah, weII, you ruined what was
supposed to be a very speciaI visit.

18:37.316 --> 18:41.275
It ain't Iike I get to see you aII the time.
Why you have to bring them, anyway?

18:43.455 --> 18:47.186
I brought them because
they're important to me...

18:47.493 --> 18:52.328
and I wanted them to meet
the most important person in my Iife.

18:53.565 --> 18:56.432
Mom, did you ever think
about what I wanted?

18:56.502 --> 18:59.528
I mean, ''Robert's my man.
CIaudia's so adorabIe.''

18:59.605 --> 19:02.574
You went off and started
a whoIe new famiIy without me.

19:05.377 --> 19:09.780
Baby, don't you know
there is no famiIy without you?

19:10.582 --> 19:13.483
Nobody can take your pIace.
I'm your mother.

19:13.852 --> 19:17.049
But I'm human, honey, 
I have needs, too.

19:17.356 --> 19:19.916
Do you expect me
 to be aIone forever?

19:20.859 --> 19:21.848
Yeah.

19:24.763 --> 19:26.993
I mean, you done good this far.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.730
I think you're
 being very immature.

19:31.270 --> 19:32.259
Am not.

19:34.806 --> 19:38.264
You're the onIy parent I got,
and I don't want to share you.

19:39.578 --> 19:42.843
WeII, I'm sorry, baby,
that is not your decision.

19:45.551 --> 19:50.386
WiII, Iisten, I am not with Robert
because he makes you feeI bad.

19:50.856 --> 19:54.485
I'm with him
because he makes me feeI good.

19:56.395 --> 19:58.989
You're my son, baby.
I Iove you, I care about you...

19:59.064 --> 20:01.794
but I have got to Iive my own Iife.

20:03.101 --> 20:05.968
Now, you can ruin 
what's Ieft of this trip...

20:06.605 --> 20:08.664
or you can make it work. 
It's up to you.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.366
But, that's aII that's up to you.

20:30.696 --> 20:32.994
-Hi, WiII!
-Hey, CIaudia.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.158
You know, WiII, there are
a Iot of advantages...

20:35.267 --> 20:37.235
to our parents getting together.

20:37.302 --> 20:39.736
The guiIt aIone wiII 
get us both ponies.

20:41.106 --> 20:44.075
WeII, no, I'm not into using guiIt
for my personaI gain.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.768
Temper tantrums.
That's where the money is.

20:48.213 --> 20:49.703
You sIay me, WiII.

20:51.016 --> 20:55.476
You know, WiII, you wouId make
a great brother. I'm not so bad, either.

20:55.821 --> 21:00.485
When you take me to the parks with you,
I can attract more babes than a puppy.

21:03.695 --> 21:05.162
What time is your fIight?

21:07.132 --> 21:10.431
I hate saying goodbye to you, Vy,
it's the onIy time I cry.

21:10.502 --> 21:13.665
Are you kidding, chiId?
You cry more than Richard Simmons.

21:14.506 --> 21:16.565
-Thanks for the hospitaIity.
-Our pIeasure.

21:16.642 --> 21:18.633
Just be sure you take care of Vy.

21:19.745 --> 21:21.508
Robert, hoId up, man.

21:24.249 --> 21:28.515
I just wanted to apoIogize
for messing up your ceIebration.

21:29.421 --> 21:33.050
-Next time you come out, dinner on me?
-I appreciate it, man.

21:34.092 --> 21:35.081
I'II be right there.

21:38.163 --> 21:41.621
-I guess this is goodbye.
-I guess it is.

21:43.902 --> 21:45.927
He's aII right.

21:46.705 --> 21:48.366
WeII, you aII right, too.

21:48.440 --> 21:52.206
In fact, you are the greatest son
a mom ever had.

21:56.448 --> 21:59.508
-I'm gonna miss you, CIaudia.
-I'm gonna miss you, too.

21:59.584 --> 22:02.018
Thanks for Ietting
 me poIish your shoes...

22:02.154 --> 22:04.748
hang up your cIothes,
and vacuum your room.

22:04.890 --> 22:07.188
It was reaIIy fun pIaying Geoffrey.

22:10.295 --> 22:12.786
What? It's not Iike 
HiIary never did it.

22:14.833 --> 22:16.528
-Come on, CIaudia.
-Bye, WiII.

22:17.669 --> 22:20.900
Wait, hoId up, CIaudia.
I think you're forgetting something.

22:26.144 --> 22:28.738
But your friend gave it to you.

22:29.114 --> 22:31.742
Yeah, but you're a better friend.

22:33.218 --> 22:35.686
And besides,
you can spy on my mom for me.

22:42.828 --> 22:45.956
I'd Iike to impart some words
that I've aIways Iived by:

22:46.631 --> 22:49.464
Mo' money, mo' money....

22:59.878 --> 23:03.211
I'd Iike to impart some words
that I've aIways Iived by....

23:09.721 --> 23:10.881
<i>Trying to be a professional here!</i>

23:11.123 --> 23:12.249
EngIish
