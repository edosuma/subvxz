WEBVTT

00:02.536 --> 00:03.104
- This is Officer Adam Ruzek

00:04.372 --> 00:05.506
requesting immediate backup.

00:05.539 --> 00:07.241
- You were out there
without the permission

00:07.275 --> 00:08.476
of a supervisor.

00:08.509 --> 00:09.710
You've been stripped
of your police powers

00:09.743 --> 00:11.445
until the chief
determines your future.

00:11.479 --> 00:13.547
- There's a young girl,
and she's my daughter.

00:13.581 --> 00:15.549
- If you have any hope
of keeping us together,

00:15.583 --> 00:18.119
you'd better get
a paternity test.

00:18.152 --> 00:20.288
- I don't know what
your relationship status is,

00:20.321 --> 00:22.123
and I don't care,
but I need to know

00:22.156 --> 00:24.525
someone's got Lindsay's back
24 hours a day.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.394
- What is that for?

00:26.427 --> 00:28.662
- Because
I wanted to kiss you.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074

00:37.305 --> 00:38.839
- I heard Roman took
the week.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.409
Is he going to Cabo
or what?

00:41.442 --> 00:43.444
- Not quite.

00:43.477 --> 00:45.646
- Ah, right.
He flew to Vegas.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.481
He's got that hook-up
at Caesars.

00:47.515 --> 00:50.151
- Actually, he's dealing
with a personal medical issue.

00:50.184 --> 00:51.752
- STD?

00:51.785 --> 00:54.522
Yeah, wouldn't be the first time
that dog's picked up fleas.

00:54.555 --> 00:58.526
- For your information,
he was donating bone marrow

00:58.559 --> 01:01.662
to a little kid, and sadly
that kid might not make it.

01:01.695 --> 01:04.165
- Wow.
Sounds depressing.

01:04.197 --> 01:06.200
- I try and see
the other side of it.

01:06.234 --> 01:09.237
What Roman is doing
is inspiring.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.139
- I donated blood once.
- Okay.

01:11.172 --> 01:13.174
- But I forgot to eat
that cookie that they give you.

01:13.207 --> 01:15.676
So I rolled to Jimbo's,
nothing in the tank.

01:15.709 --> 01:17.811
A couple of pops later,
I wake up in bed

01:17.845 --> 01:21.549
with my mom's best friend.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.284
Janice.

01:23.317 --> 01:27.288
- 2113.
- Go for 2113, squad.

01:27.321 --> 01:30.291
- Need you to roll on
a 10-37 at Union Park.

01:30.324 --> 01:32.260
Caller states there's
a suspicious person

01:32.293 --> 01:33.261
in a black SUV.

01:33.294 --> 01:37.298
- Ten four, dispatch.
We are three blocks out.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.542
What are you doing
out here so late?

01:48.576 --> 01:51.345
- Just hanging, talking.

01:51.379 --> 01:52.813
- Oh, my favorite pastime.

01:52.846 --> 01:55.583
Talking with girls in cars
at midnight.

01:55.616 --> 01:58.519
- He's obviously some perv
spying on people,

01:58.552 --> 02:00.554
so I called it in.

02:00.588 --> 02:03.291
- Okay, we'll take it
from here.

02:03.324 --> 02:04.492
Go home.

02:04.525 --> 02:05.693
Price, you come with me.

02:05.726 --> 02:08.562
- All right, let's do this.

02:08.596 --> 02:09.763
He probably had
one too many drinks

02:09.797 --> 02:11.699
and passed out
before he made it home.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.801
- Sir?

02:13.834 --> 02:16.570
Please exit the vehicle.

02:16.604 --> 02:18.772
- Hey!
Let's go.

02:18.806 --> 02:21.242
- No, he's not passed out.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.676
This guy's dead.

02:22.710 --> 02:26.814
- Damn, you're right.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.449
- Dispatch,
roll an ambulance

02:28.482 --> 02:30.951
to the northwest corner
of Union Park.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.653
- Copy that.
- Easy, buddy.

02:32.686 --> 02:33.654
- Son of a bitch!

02:33.687 --> 02:36.490
- Northwest corner
of Union Park.

02:36.524 --> 02:38.459
[gunshot]

02:38.492 --> 02:40.494
- Are you out of
your mind?

02:40.528 --> 02:42.730
- I just thought that--
- The glass.

02:42.763 --> 02:45.766
Obviously bulletproof.

02:49.270 --> 02:52.740
Dispatch,
we've got a situation.

02:56.277 --> 02:59.280
[indistinct chatter]

03:01.415 --> 03:03.684
- The entire SUV is coated
with a bullet resistant seal.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.619
Even the chassis
is bombproof.

03:05.653 --> 03:07.455
- The kind of vehicle
dignitaries

03:07.488 --> 03:09.490
or government agents use.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.695
- Three, two...
- Hey, you guys might want

03:14.728 --> 03:15.729
to step back.
- One!

03:20.901 --> 03:22.803
Ugh.
Ripe.

03:26.740 --> 03:29.877
White male,
50-ish.

03:29.910 --> 03:32.413
No signs of foul play.

03:32.446 --> 03:35.983
Searching for I.D.

03:36.016 --> 03:37.718
No wallet.

03:37.751 --> 03:41.489
He's got
a stainless steel 1911.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.858
- Hey, guys.
The license plate came back.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.727
This SUV's registered
to a company.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.563
Peregrine Security.
Owned by one Victor Cullen.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.899
Mouse is sending you
his DMV photo now.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.501
[phone chimes]

03:53.534 --> 03:57.271
- Recognize this guy?

03:57.305 --> 03:59.773
- That's him.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.909
Okay, get a warrant
for Cullen's address.

04:01.942 --> 04:04.445
Have the others
meet us there.

04:15.022 --> 04:15.989
- [grunts]
[thud]

04:16.023 --> 04:18.959
[alarm beeping]

04:24.865 --> 04:27.267
[alarm blaring]

04:39.347 --> 04:40.348
[alarm stops]

04:47.755 --> 04:51.725
- Check this out.

04:51.759 --> 04:52.960
- Huh.

05:01.769 --> 05:03.704
- Whoa.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.105
- Huh.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.940
- This guy
was somebody important.

05:06.974 --> 05:09.877
I'm looking at
a million dollars here.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.512
[loud clang]

05:12.913 --> 05:14.982
- It's the back-up
generators.

05:15.015 --> 05:19.353
[power up whine]

05:28.462 --> 05:29.897
- [gasps]

05:49.049 --> 05:49.417
.

05:49.450 --> 05:50.183
[van beeping]
- Whoa, that's good.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.155
- Well, what've you got for me?

05:55.188 --> 05:57.425
[chuckles]

05:57.458 --> 05:58.826
Wow.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.994
You arrest the leader
of a small African republic?

06:01.028 --> 06:04.565
- Start cataloging 'em,
get 'em to forensics ASAP.

06:04.598 --> 06:06.567
- Roger that.

06:08.802 --> 06:12.072
Hey, Al.
Uh, that DNA test

06:12.105 --> 06:13.941
that you wanted on Michelle.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.543
The results are in.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.878
I guess congrats
either way.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.655
- Yeah, you got it.

06:27.688 --> 06:31.124
Hey, that was Mouse
asking if anyone was available

06:31.158 --> 06:33.794
to help inventory all the guns
that were recovered last night.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.629
I volunteered you.
- No, come on, Sarge.

06:35.663 --> 06:38.031
I just--I want to take a shower
and sleep for, like, two days.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.000
- Take a bird bath
in the ladies room.

06:40.033 --> 06:42.836
Overtime is like gold
around here.

06:46.907 --> 06:50.611
- Hey, look, can I
ask you something?

06:50.644 --> 06:52.646
Look, Adam is trying so hard
to be stoic

06:52.680 --> 06:55.015
about getting stripped,
but it's not him, you know?

06:55.048 --> 06:56.550
He wears everything
on his sleeve,

06:56.584 --> 06:58.452
which is maybe why
I just love him.

07:01.889 --> 07:04.892
You know what?
Forget it.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.528
- Burgess,
we're like sisters.

07:07.561 --> 07:09.630
We can talk about
our problems.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.965
For example,
come here.

07:11.999 --> 07:14.034
- Okay.

07:14.067 --> 07:16.737
- I'm with Mouch last night,
and we're doing our thing.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.906
You know, I got Black Sabbath
going on the stereo,

07:18.939 --> 07:21.208
and he's rounding the bases,
heading towards home.

07:21.241 --> 07:23.477
All of a sudden--
- Oh, you know what, Sarge?

07:23.511 --> 07:26.747
I don't think that I'm old
enough to hear this story.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.148
How about just
a little advice?

07:28.181 --> 07:29.316
- Go ahead, shoot.
- Okay.

07:29.349 --> 07:32.553
This Crowley, she seems
to really have it in for Adam.

07:32.586 --> 07:33.754
And he's great police.

07:33.787 --> 07:34.988
I think I should tell her
as much.

07:35.022 --> 07:35.956
- Oh.

07:35.989 --> 07:38.058
Go and give one of
the highest ranking females

07:38.091 --> 07:40.160
in the department
a piece of your mind?

07:40.193 --> 07:42.195
Do not do that.

07:44.865 --> 07:48.702
- Black Sabbath?
- Works every time.

07:48.736 --> 07:52.540
Even when it doesn't.

07:52.573 --> 07:55.142
- Uh, just so you know,
the other night on the couch--

07:55.175 --> 07:56.844
- Oh, yeah.
It was a great choice.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.679
- Mm.
- Supple yet firm.

07:58.712 --> 08:01.649
- It was a one-time deal.
- One time, got it.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.116
- Mm-hmm.
- Got it, one-time deal.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.753
- I mean it.
Gotta be professional.

08:08.589 --> 08:10.524
- Hey, boss, hey.
- Yeah.

08:10.558 --> 08:12.826
Uh, any word about my case?

08:12.860 --> 08:14.061
'Cause I'm kinda
climbing up the walls here.

08:14.094 --> 08:17.264
- I made a few calls trying to
pull in a favor with the Chief.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.299
In the meantime,
give Mouse a hand

08:19.332 --> 08:21.569
with those guns
we seized.

08:21.602 --> 08:23.136
All right,
what do we got?

08:23.170 --> 08:24.304
- Victor Cullen.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.139
Five years ago,
he founded Peregrine.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.008
It's a corporate security firm.
- Mm-hmm.

08:28.041 --> 08:31.078
- Before that, his work history
is blank for several decades.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.913
- The M.E. is performing
the autopsy as we speak,

08:32.946 --> 08:34.313
and from his preliminary
findings,

08:34.347 --> 08:35.816
Cullen was dead
for at least a week.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.719
- Yeah, patrol working
the Union Park beat says

08:38.751 --> 08:40.087
Cullen's SUV wasn't there

08:40.120 --> 08:41.621
when they made their sweep
the night before,

08:41.655 --> 08:43.222
so someone drove his body there
and left it.

08:43.256 --> 08:45.325
- Neighbors say
he was extremely private.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.894
No family in the area.

08:46.927 --> 08:49.930
He had a long-time girlfriend
named Jainie Saunders.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.198
- What?
Cullen's been dead a week

08:51.231 --> 08:53.266
and his girlfriend
doesn't report it?

08:53.300 --> 08:54.935
She's suspect number one.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.136
Find her and bring her in.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.772
- Uh, Hank,
we don't have to.

08:58.806 --> 09:03.577
Jainie Saunders is downstairs
with her lawyer.

09:03.611 --> 09:04.845
- After this morning's
news segment,

09:04.878 --> 09:06.880
my client wanted
to voluntarily come in.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.115
She's an emotional wreck,

09:08.148 --> 09:09.783
and she's only willing
to admit

09:09.817 --> 09:11.318
to improper disposal
of human remains.

09:11.351 --> 09:13.120
- All right, well, until we get
the autopsy results in,

09:13.153 --> 09:14.588
we can't rule out
foul play.

09:14.622 --> 09:18.859
- I did not kill Victor.
He had arrhythmia.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.961
I begged him to get treatment,
but he refused.

09:20.994 --> 09:23.130
He just kept popping aspirin.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.264
- So what happened?

09:24.297 --> 09:25.866
- We were at home.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.335
One minute having dinner,
and the next,

09:28.368 --> 09:31.672
he collapsed.
A heart attack.

09:31.705 --> 09:36.009
- So instead of calling 911,
you did what exactly?

09:36.043 --> 09:37.811
- I put him in the garage.

09:37.845 --> 09:40.147
Then last night,
I drove him to the park.

09:40.180 --> 09:44.251
- Jainie, you have to imagine
how this looks on our end.

09:44.284 --> 09:46.319
Victor's been dead a week,

09:46.353 --> 09:48.956
yet he turned up in the park
last night.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.825
We searched his home
and we found an arsenal

09:51.859 --> 09:53.894
and a million dollars cash
in the basement.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.830
- You think I don't know
how this looks?

09:56.864 --> 09:58.932
I loved Victor.

09:58.966 --> 10:01.168
I loved him.

10:01.201 --> 10:04.071
I just did
what he told me to do.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.339
- Which was what?

10:06.373 --> 10:09.376
- Jainie, you got to
help yourself out here.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.915
- Victor said that
if he ever died,

10:14.948 --> 10:16.784
I should leave his body
in a public place,

10:16.817 --> 10:18.686
and the agency
would find him.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.721
- Agency?

10:20.754 --> 10:23.757
- Victor...he was CIA.

10:27.695 --> 10:30.330
- Hey.
- Hey, Sean, what's that for?

10:30.363 --> 10:31.932
- I'm gonna be
your driver today.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.367
- The doctor said
I wasn't allowed outside.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.069
- I think it'll be okay.

10:36.103 --> 10:38.038
- It'll be fine.

10:38.071 --> 10:39.172
- Where are we going?

10:39.206 --> 10:42.309
- Well, that's a surprise.
Ready?

10:42.342 --> 10:45.445
- There you go.
- All right.

10:45.478 --> 10:48.716
Here we go.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.918
- Here's his bag.
- All right.

10:50.951 --> 10:52.820
I'll have him back
in a little bit.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.855
- Okay.

10:57.090 --> 11:00.127
- Oh, I almost forgot.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.862
We're officially partners.

11:01.895 --> 11:04.698
- Really?
- Yep.

11:05.966 --> 11:08.101
So you better have my back
out there, okay?

11:08.135 --> 11:10.137
- Okay.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.923
- Olinsky.
- Bishop.

11:29.957 --> 11:34.294
- Hey, 1999. Hezbollah and
Latin Kings in bed together.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.964
Seems like a lifetime ago.

11:36.997 --> 11:40.133
- I take it this isn't
a stroll down memory lane.

11:40.167 --> 11:43.170
- Victor Cullen.
Found his body last night.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.372
Supposedly one of yours.

11:45.405 --> 11:48.441
- Never heard of him.

11:48.475 --> 11:51.912
Then again,
you never know who's who.

11:51.945 --> 11:55.182
- I'd appreciate it
if you could find out for me.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.417
- I'll reach out
to the powers that be.

11:57.450 --> 11:58.718
- Thanks.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.357
- Okay.

12:06.827 --> 12:07.795
- Got it.
- Good?

12:07.828 --> 12:09.062
- Yeah.

12:09.096 --> 12:10.530
Hey, babe, I'm sorry
you got stuck down here

12:10.563 --> 12:11.965
doing grunt work.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.767
- So much better
than answering the phones.

12:13.801 --> 12:15.335
Let me tell you.

12:15.368 --> 12:16.837
Besides, I'm kind of
enjoying the company.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.338
- [chuckles]
Me too.

12:18.371 --> 12:19.339
- Good?
- Yeah.

12:19.372 --> 12:20.808
- All right.

12:20.841 --> 12:23.911
- Hey, listen...
About the wedding...

12:23.944 --> 12:27.480
You know, like picking
a date and all that.

12:27.514 --> 12:31.084
Like, until the whole thing
with Deputy Crowley blows over,

12:31.118 --> 12:32.953
let's just not
worry about it, okay?

12:32.986 --> 12:35.288
- Hey, Kim, you know,

12:35.322 --> 12:36.456
whether I'm a cop or not,

12:36.489 --> 12:38.491
our relationship's
not going to change.

12:38.525 --> 12:39.759
You know that?

12:39.793 --> 12:43.030
'Cause you're like the best
thing I got going on right now.

12:46.066 --> 12:48.068
- Okay.

12:52.139 --> 12:54.374
- What's happening, gents?

12:54.407 --> 12:57.177
- I don't know, Mouse.
You called us.

12:57.210 --> 13:00.948
- Oh, yeah, ballistics started
coming in on Cullen's guns.

13:00.981 --> 13:04.284
And three of them match
three unsolved murders

13:04.317 --> 13:05.886
that happened
in the last year.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.454
I have no idea
how Cullen is connected,

13:07.487 --> 13:10.557
but there's
a strange pattern.

13:10.590 --> 13:13.126
Eddie Diaz.
The gangbanger who beat

13:13.160 --> 13:14.862
a manslaughter charge
a few years back.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.229
His stray bullet
killed a little girl.

13:16.263 --> 13:19.032
His lawyer got him off
on a technicality.

13:19.066 --> 13:22.970
He was executed point-blank
in his garage.

13:23.003 --> 13:26.106
Second,
Mr. Josh Henderson.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.308
He's a UIC dropout
turned computer hacker.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.210
He preyed on a string
of elderly victims.

13:30.243 --> 13:31.278
Drained their bank accounts.

13:31.311 --> 13:35.148
Got probation, but he was
ambushed at a stoplight

13:35.182 --> 13:37.050
less than six months ago.

13:37.084 --> 13:40.387
And the third,
one Terrence Jenkins.

13:40.420 --> 13:43.390
- Arrested for multiple sexual
assaults of underage girls.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.358
None of them would testify
at trial, so he walked.

13:45.392 --> 13:47.294
- He did.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.628
Until they found his body
shot to death

13:48.661 --> 13:50.297
last month in a field
near Hegewisch.

13:50.330 --> 13:53.466
- Hmm.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.968
- If Cullen really is CIA,

13:55.002 --> 13:56.870
then maybe this is
some secret program.

13:56.904 --> 13:58.371
- Yo, Sarge.
- Hmm?

13:58.405 --> 14:00.507
- I just got off the phone
with the medical examiner.

14:00.540 --> 14:03.276
Victor Cullen's body was
just stolen from Chicago Med.

14:11.885 --> 14:12.019
.

14:12.052 --> 14:12.652
- Sir,
welcome to the 21st.

14:15.055 --> 14:16.123
Are you ready for duty,
sir?

14:16.156 --> 14:18.158
- Sure am.

14:24.932 --> 14:27.901
- Your hat, sir.

14:27.935 --> 14:29.903
This way.

14:29.937 --> 14:32.940
- Looking good, Captain.
- Your office, sir.

14:35.608 --> 14:40.547
- And here we go.
- Cool.

14:40.580 --> 14:43.183
- A little something
for you, sir.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.285
- What do you think, Andrew?
- Awesome.

14:45.318 --> 14:48.355
- Okay. Now, we have
a very busy day, sir.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.925
We're doing cell checks,
interviewing offenders,

14:51.959 --> 14:53.593
taking a trip
to the gun range.

14:53.626 --> 14:56.429
- Really? The range?
- If we have time, sure thing.

14:56.463 --> 14:58.598
- But first, sir, I am going
to need your signature

14:58.631 --> 15:01.701
on this asset forfeiture form.
- What's that?

15:01.734 --> 15:03.436
- It means we're taking
a brand-new Porsche

15:03.470 --> 15:08.041
from a drug dealer.

15:08.075 --> 15:10.277
- Wow. Can't wait to be a cop
when I grow up.

15:15.182 --> 15:17.985
- Sir, what would you like
in your coffee?

15:18.018 --> 15:20.954
Cream and sugar?
- You got hot chocolate?

15:20.988 --> 15:23.290
- One hot chocolate
coming up.

15:23.323 --> 15:24.691
- Excellent choice, sir.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.698
- They forced their way in,
attacked me.

15:31.731 --> 15:34.301
It happened so fast.

15:34.334 --> 15:36.069
- They move like pros.
- Yeah.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.637
You got anything on
the parking lot cams?

15:37.670 --> 15:40.173
- One of them caught a black SUV
speeding from the lot.

15:40.207 --> 15:41.441
No plates.

15:41.474 --> 15:44.544
I wonder if Victor Cullen was as
interesting alive as he is dead.

15:44.577 --> 15:48.081
- His girlfriend said the CIA
would want his body, right?

15:48.115 --> 15:49.749
Who else would take it?

15:49.782 --> 15:51.651
- Look,
secret operation or not,

15:51.684 --> 15:54.054
you can't commit murder
and steal bodies with impunity.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.990
[phone vibrating]
Yeah?

15:57.024 --> 15:59.026
- Hank, we got a hold
of DMV records.

15:59.059 --> 16:01.228
In addition to the SUV
that we found Cullen in,

16:01.261 --> 16:03.630
he's registered three other
identical vehicles,

16:03.663 --> 16:05.498
all purchased
through his company.

16:05.532 --> 16:08.668
All four of Cullen's SUVs
were outfitted as bulletproof

16:08.701 --> 16:11.204
by a car-armoring company
on Pulaski.

16:11.238 --> 16:13.006
- So we got three armed
offenders

16:13.040 --> 16:14.741
driving around the city
in custom tanks?

16:14.774 --> 16:18.311
- The thing is, Cullen never
picked up any of the SUVs.

16:18.345 --> 16:21.081
One of his employees did,
a guy named Ryan Bergstrom.

16:21.114 --> 16:23.383
We gonna send you
his LKA now.

16:28.255 --> 16:30.323
- Just got the alert
on this guy.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.025
Ryan Bergstrom.

16:32.059 --> 16:34.194
His record's clean
until he ripped off a body.

16:34.227 --> 16:36.229
- All right.

16:42.435 --> 16:46.039
This sure looks like
one of Cullen's SUVs.

16:49.776 --> 16:51.744
Okay, you take the back.
- All right.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.620
- Go.

17:08.395 --> 17:11.397
[saw buzzing]

17:28.515 --> 17:30.283
Chicago P.D.!

17:30.317 --> 17:32.685
Freeze!

17:32.719 --> 17:34.321
Freeze!

17:34.354 --> 17:36.389
- Gun!

17:37.890 --> 17:40.093
- Go!

17:47.567 --> 17:49.236
- [grunting]

17:53.673 --> 17:55.675
- Don't move!

18:02.182 --> 18:04.884
- I'm a special agent
with the CIA.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.120
I got clearances.

18:11.491 --> 18:14.827
- It says here you took
the CPD test three times.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.763
Each time,
you were rejected.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.298
Color blind, huh?

18:18.331 --> 18:22.235
- Yet somehow you were
recruited into the CIA.

18:22.269 --> 18:25.238
- You got my letter there,
right?

18:25.272 --> 18:26.739
- This thing?

18:26.773 --> 18:29.342
A letter of immunity from
the Central Intelligence Agency,

18:29.376 --> 18:31.611
signed by Victor Cullen.
That's your proof?

18:31.644 --> 18:33.380
- Yeah, that's all
the proof you need.

18:33.413 --> 18:35.848
- You won't tell us anything
about your so-called operation,

18:35.882 --> 18:38.418
at least tell me this.

18:38.451 --> 18:41.888
Why dismember Cullen's body?

18:41.921 --> 18:45.925
- I was following orders.
- Okay.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.495
- Whose?

18:48.528 --> 18:49.896
- [exhales sharply]

18:49.929 --> 18:53.766
- I'm just
a simple city cop.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.369
I'm sure this is
a real inconvenience

18:56.403 --> 18:58.671
for a government agent
like you.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.640
I got bosses
I got to answer to.

19:00.673 --> 19:03.776
I gotta give them
something.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.346
So do me a favor,
okay?

19:06.379 --> 19:07.880
Just shed some light.

19:07.914 --> 19:09.916
That's all I'm asking.

19:14.354 --> 19:17.890
- I'm part of an operation
called Streetcleaner.

19:17.924 --> 19:21.961
We neutralize targets posing as
threats to national security.

19:21.994 --> 19:26.733
Targets that simple city cops
couldn't get off the street.

19:26.766 --> 19:29.436
- Why dismember Cullen?

19:29.469 --> 19:34.441
- I was looking
for something.

19:34.474 --> 19:37.444
When an agent dies,
their chip has to be removed.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.714
- From his body?

19:41.748 --> 19:43.883
- Those were
my instructions, yes.

19:43.916 --> 19:46.653
- The weapons we found
at Cullen's house?

19:46.686 --> 19:50.790
We can tie him
to three unsolved murders.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.925
You're saying those murders
are sanctioned?

19:52.959 --> 19:57.897
- I'm not saying anything,
actually.

19:57.930 --> 20:02.235
So can I go now?
[knocking]

20:02.269 --> 20:04.271
- Hank, you got a minute?

20:27.660 --> 20:30.997
- Hey.
That name you provided,

20:31.030 --> 20:34.267
Victor Cullen,
I had it checked out.

20:34.301 --> 20:37.737
Looks like you've got
a false alarm.

20:37.770 --> 20:38.871
- What exactly
does that mean?

20:40.773 --> 20:43.876
- Cullen was with the Agency,
just for a minute,

20:43.910 --> 20:45.645
but never a field agent.

20:45.678 --> 20:48.047
He was an intelligence analyst
right out of college,

20:48.080 --> 20:50.650
stationed down in Panama.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.719
- Working the Iran-Contra
scandal?

20:52.752 --> 20:55.888
- Around that time,
but he didn't last long.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.657
Cullen suffered
a meltdown.

20:57.690 --> 21:00.493
Turned out he'd been lying
on his psych reports.

21:00.527 --> 21:03.996
So they shipped him home,
cut him loose.

21:04.030 --> 21:06.833
- Ever since, he's been
playing secret agent.

21:13.373 --> 21:13.540
.

21:13.573 --> 21:14.341
- I had my own office
and everything.

21:15.975 --> 21:19.846
Then they gave me this CPD
leather, like a real Captain.

21:19.879 --> 21:21.681
- I'm so proud of you,
honey.

21:21.714 --> 21:24.517
- But we didn't make it
to the gun range, Sean.

21:24.551 --> 21:26.786
Can we go tomorrow?

21:26.819 --> 21:28.821
- Definitely tomorrow.

21:31.724 --> 21:33.560
- I'm gonna go grab
some coffee.

21:33.593 --> 21:35.895
Do you want some?
- Uh, sure.

21:35.928 --> 21:37.029
- Okay.

21:39.031 --> 21:41.067
- My dad was supposed to
come here today.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.536
I'm glad
you're here instead.

21:43.570 --> 21:45.071
- Hey, I'm sure
he means well.

21:45.104 --> 21:48.508
- I don't know.
He always makes my mom cry.

21:48.541 --> 21:50.009
I think she likes you better.

21:56.849 --> 21:59.552
- Finally got access
to Cullen's financial records.

21:59.586 --> 22:01.120
His security firm
was well-funded,

22:01.153 --> 22:02.955
but not by the government.

22:02.989 --> 22:04.457
His mother.

22:04.491 --> 22:06.793
She owned a huge soybean farm
downstate.

22:06.826 --> 22:07.927
Passed away five years ago.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.128
When it was sold off,

22:09.161 --> 22:11.531
Cullen inherited
over 30 million.

22:11.564 --> 22:13.833
His bank statements indicate
Cullen was withdrawing

22:13.866 --> 22:16.403
large amounts of cash
the last few years.

22:16.436 --> 22:18.671
It seems he was paying Bergstrom
and his other operatives

22:18.705 --> 22:20.407
15k a week.

22:20.440 --> 22:23.042
- Damn.
I wish he was still hiring.

22:23.075 --> 22:26.078
- Guys,
this is Dr. Charles.

22:26.112 --> 22:29.382
Dr. Charles,
welcome to Intelligence.

22:29.416 --> 22:31.518
- So...this is it.

22:31.551 --> 22:32.952
The infamous black site

22:32.985 --> 22:34.721
I've been reading about
all these years.

22:34.754 --> 22:35.988
- Not everything you read
is true.

22:36.022 --> 22:38.090
- Uh, please.

22:38.124 --> 22:40.427
I asked Dr. Charles
if he could dig up

22:40.460 --> 22:42.429
Victor Cullen's
medical history for us,

22:42.462 --> 22:44.564
maybe shed
a little light.

22:44.597 --> 22:48.167
- So, Cullen indeed had
a physical condition.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.069
Heart ailment
dating way back.

22:50.102 --> 22:52.972
But it's his psych file
that's fascinating.

22:53.005 --> 22:56.075
He suffered from something
called delusional disorder.

22:56.108 --> 22:58.745
People suffering from
delusional disorder

22:58.778 --> 23:03.015
continue to function
and present as perfectly normal.

23:03.049 --> 23:05.652
Hence, Cullen's remarkable
ability to recruit people

23:05.685 --> 23:07.420
into his Soldier of Fortune
universe.

23:07.454 --> 23:10.189
To him it was all
absolutely real,

23:10.222 --> 23:12.158
which is why
it felt real to others.

23:12.191 --> 23:15.394
- Doc, we got somebody else
who needs to hear this.

23:17.697 --> 23:21.768
- After, uh,
Cullen stopped taking his meds,

23:21.801 --> 23:24.136
he started to create
his own assignments.

23:24.170 --> 23:27.907
Trying to relive
his glory days in the CIA,

23:27.940 --> 23:30.643
except for
none of it was real.

23:35.582 --> 23:37.750
I understand how difficult

23:37.784 --> 23:41.888
it must be for you
to hear this.

23:41.921 --> 23:44.924
- The things I've done...

23:51.263 --> 23:53.700
I'm not a criminal,
all right?

23:53.733 --> 23:56.536
Those scumbags who got off,
they're the criminals.

23:56.569 --> 24:00.673
- Yeah. Well, here's
your reality check.

24:00.707 --> 24:02.575
Whether they were
bad guys or not,

24:02.609 --> 24:05.645
you still committed
multiple pre-meditated murders.

24:05.678 --> 24:09.215
- Hey, you contact the others,
help bring them in,

24:09.248 --> 24:10.683
we'll talk to
the state's attorney,

24:10.717 --> 24:11.684
see what we can do.

24:11.718 --> 24:12.819
- Look, even if I could,

24:12.852 --> 24:15.054
Cullen gave strict orders.

24:15.087 --> 24:16.556
If something was to happen
to him,

24:16.589 --> 24:18.024
we were to only take
instructions

24:18.057 --> 24:20.560
from a CIA handler
in D.C.

24:20.593 --> 24:23.596
A guy named Carl Jacobs.

24:26.633 --> 24:28.868
- Did any of you
ever meet this Jacobs?

24:28.901 --> 24:32.104
- No. No, but he
promised we would

24:32.138 --> 24:34.006
once the operation
was completed.

24:34.040 --> 24:36.709
- Sorry, but given the facts,
it's highly likely

24:36.743 --> 24:38.978
that this Mr. Jacobs
was also a figment

24:39.011 --> 24:42.014
of Mr. Cullen's
imagination.

24:45.618 --> 24:48.254
- Special Agent Jacobs?
- Yeah.

24:48.287 --> 24:50.056
- We'll hear you over the phone
and your I.D.

24:50.089 --> 24:50.857
- Oh, good.

24:50.890 --> 24:52.559
- Yeah, I copied
the CIA's watermark.

24:52.592 --> 24:54.093
It looks...
looks like the real thing.

24:54.126 --> 24:55.862
- Yeah.
- So...

24:55.895 --> 24:58.565
what did
the DNA results say?

24:58.598 --> 25:01.033
- I haven't opened it yet.
- I get it.

25:01.067 --> 25:04.871
Savoring the moment?
- Thanks, thank you.

25:04.904 --> 25:07.239
- Hey.
You all set?

25:07.273 --> 25:09.709
All right, listen up.

25:09.742 --> 25:13.312
Bergstrom's reached out
to the other two operatives.

25:13.345 --> 25:14.747
Why don't you tell them?

25:14.781 --> 25:18.951
- Yeah. I left a coded message
on Craigslist.

25:18.985 --> 25:20.119
"Missed Connection" board.

25:20.152 --> 25:22.722
It's how Cullen
would reach out to us.

25:22.755 --> 25:25.758
Every day, we'd log on
and read it.

25:25.792 --> 25:27.594
And if there was mention
of the 39th floor,

25:27.627 --> 25:29.729
we knew to meet
at Wabash Tower.

25:29.762 --> 25:31.297
He would lease
the 39th floor.

25:31.330 --> 25:33.265
It's where we'd meet
and plan our operations.

25:33.299 --> 25:37.136
Me, John, and Clay.

25:37.169 --> 25:38.838
We never shared
our full names.

25:38.871 --> 25:41.674
- Wabash Tower. There's a lot
of civilians, in and out.

25:41.708 --> 25:43.576
I assume your pals
show up packing?

25:43.610 --> 25:45.978
- We'll set up a perimeter
and grab them before they enter.

25:46.012 --> 25:48.147
- That could turn into
a shoot-out on Wacker Drive.

25:48.180 --> 25:50.683
- No.

25:50.717 --> 25:53.252
We let our CIA handler
get their guard down.

25:53.285 --> 25:54.086
He'll lure 'em out.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.623
We take 'em down
without any incident.

25:56.656 --> 25:57.857
- Once they hear the sound
of my voice,

25:57.890 --> 25:59.759
they'll follow the piper.

26:22.381 --> 26:25.351
- Who's this?

26:25.384 --> 26:27.720
- Jacobs.

26:27.754 --> 26:29.021
- When he heard
what happened to Cullen,

26:29.055 --> 26:32.324
he flew out from D.C.

26:32.358 --> 26:34.160
- Where's John?
- And where have you been?

26:34.193 --> 26:36.395
- He's been in
a holding cell.

26:36.428 --> 26:37.964
You report to me now.

26:37.997 --> 26:39.231
- Wait, the cops
are involved?

26:39.265 --> 26:40.767
- For a minute,
but I handled them.

26:42.301 --> 26:44.303
- Credentials.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.717
- Satisfied?

26:58.785 --> 27:02.889
- Only one of 'em showed up.

27:02.922 --> 27:06.058
- Well, that's better
than none.

27:06.092 --> 27:08.728
- We have a target.
Get ready.

27:08.761 --> 27:11.263
- We're going to need to find
John and bring him in as well.

27:11.297 --> 27:12.431
Where is he?

27:12.464 --> 27:13.465
- I don't know.

27:13.499 --> 27:15.735
He said he was going to see
the mission through.

27:15.768 --> 27:18.170
- Well, there is no more mission
'cause Cullen is dead.

27:18.204 --> 27:19.972
So I'm gonna take you
to the field office,

27:20.006 --> 27:23.910
get you some clearance.

27:23.943 --> 27:27.279
- Listen,
Jacobs can fix all of this.

27:30.783 --> 27:32.952
- And I'm going to need you
to release that sidearm.

27:32.985 --> 27:35.154
- Until I'm all clear,
I'll hold on to it.

27:35.187 --> 27:38.324
- All right,
I can respect that.

27:38.357 --> 27:39.892
Let's go.

27:40.893 --> 27:42.094
Come on.

27:44.196 --> 27:47.466
- They're on their way.
Let's move.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.068
- Excuse me, sir.

27:49.101 --> 27:51.070
Sir, police business.

27:51.103 --> 27:52.739
Can you use
another elevator, please?

27:52.772 --> 27:56.042
- Police business.
Can you clear the area, please?

27:56.075 --> 27:57.376
Thank you.

28:00.446 --> 28:02.815
- All right, as soon
as it opens, we take him.

28:05.117 --> 28:07.453
- Cullen talked a lot
about you.

28:07.486 --> 28:11.724
Said you worked a covert op
in Rhodesia.

28:11.758 --> 28:14.326
- Yeah, East Africa.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.028
Talk about a party.

28:16.062 --> 28:18.464
- Yeah, I must have
heard that story ten times.

28:18.497 --> 28:22.434
How the two of you survived on
beef stew MREs for six months.

28:22.468 --> 28:24.070
- Mm-hmm.

28:24.103 --> 28:27.874
The reason I can never
eat another steak in my life.

28:27.907 --> 28:32.745
- Yeah, what was the name
of the operation?

28:32.779 --> 28:35.347
- Operations are like women.

28:35.381 --> 28:38.885
You can never remember
all their names.

28:38.918 --> 28:41.253
- You remember the name?
- [chuckles]

28:41.287 --> 28:42.789
Yeah, of course.
It was--

28:42.822 --> 28:45.825
- Let Jacobs say it.

28:51.363 --> 28:52.899
You traitor.

28:52.932 --> 28:54.533
[gunshot]
- [grunts]

28:54.566 --> 28:56.302
- Shots fired.
- Back up, back up.

28:56.335 --> 28:57.904
Everybody get back.

28:57.937 --> 28:59.505
[both grunting]

28:59.538 --> 29:01.808
[gunfire]
[glass shattering]

29:01.841 --> 29:04.376
[both grunting]

29:04.410 --> 29:05.344
[gunshot]

29:05.377 --> 29:07.213
[both grunting]

29:07.246 --> 29:09.248
[gunshots]

29:11.450 --> 29:14.787
[commotion]

29:15.922 --> 29:17.289
- Third floor.
Move!

29:27.299 --> 29:30.036
Alvin!

29:30.069 --> 29:31.237
Alvin, you all right?

29:31.270 --> 29:34.240
- 10-1, officer shot, roll
an ambulance to Wabash Tower.

29:42.148 --> 29:42.314
.

29:42.348 --> 29:42.681
- Take cover.

29:50.422 --> 29:52.424
[gunfire]

29:54.994 --> 29:56.996
This way!

30:03.002 --> 30:07.406
[gunfire]

30:08.908 --> 30:11.978
Drop your weapon!

30:12.011 --> 30:14.847
[gunfire]

30:14.881 --> 30:17.116
[siren blaring]

30:32.398 --> 30:34.967
- I'm--I'm so sorry.
I just got to talk to her.

30:35.001 --> 30:37.103
Hey, Emma.

30:37.136 --> 30:39.371
- Trudy.

30:39.405 --> 30:43.209
- You doing that caveman thing?
- Paleo diet.

30:43.242 --> 30:45.644
- Oh.
I wish I had that discipline.

30:45.677 --> 30:49.315
- All it takes is owning
the decisions you make.

30:49.348 --> 30:50.382
- Yeah.

30:50.416 --> 30:52.518
I remember when we were
in the academy

30:52.551 --> 30:54.120
and they did
that locker search

30:54.153 --> 30:57.256
and you asked me to hide
your Percodan in my locker.

30:57.289 --> 30:59.491
I got put on
probationary status for that.

30:59.525 --> 31:00.993
And you, what,
you got, like,

31:01.027 --> 31:02.929
a marksmanship medal
the next week?

31:02.962 --> 31:04.030
Oh, good, ziti.

31:04.063 --> 31:07.366
- Those pills, you know
they were for my back pain.

31:07.399 --> 31:09.635
- Right.
And all the wine I drink

31:09.668 --> 31:12.004
is for my front desk syndrome.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.378
- Something you need, Trudy?

31:19.411 --> 31:22.014
- I just need two minutes
of your time.

31:25.251 --> 31:27.219
- Hey.

31:27.253 --> 31:29.121
That was a good shoot.

31:29.155 --> 31:30.622
You had no choice.

31:30.656 --> 31:33.325
- Yeah.
Any word from Med?

31:33.359 --> 31:36.195
- Yeah. Bergstrom is
in critical condition,

31:36.228 --> 31:37.029
but he'll live.

31:37.063 --> 31:40.399
More importantly,
Al is gonna be okay.

31:40.432 --> 31:41.934
Okay, he got a couple
of cracked ribs,

31:41.968 --> 31:43.202
no internal damage.

31:43.235 --> 31:46.172
- Isn't this like number seven
or eight out of Al's nine lives?

31:46.205 --> 31:47.373
We should send him
something, right?

31:47.406 --> 31:49.341
- I mean, at least a bottle
of Bordeaux and a party cup.

31:49.375 --> 31:51.277
- All right, we got an ID
on this dead operative?

31:51.310 --> 31:53.379
- Yep.
Clay Carlson.

31:53.412 --> 31:56.048
Pulled his prints,
he's got no priors.

31:56.082 --> 31:57.984
Did eight years
in the Marines.

31:58.017 --> 32:01.253
Got discharged two years ago,
spotty work history ever since.

32:01.287 --> 32:02.989
- Disenfranchised
ex-military.

32:03.022 --> 32:04.123
Needed a job.

32:04.156 --> 32:05.624
He's the perfect guy
for Cullen to recruit.

32:05.657 --> 32:07.960
- You hear from Al?
- Yeah, he's gonna be fine.

32:07.994 --> 32:09.028
What do you got?

32:09.061 --> 32:10.662
- About halfway through
cataloging Cullen's arsenal,

32:10.696 --> 32:12.131
we got a hit
on this thing.

32:12.164 --> 32:14.166
An M24 Army sniper rifle.

32:14.200 --> 32:16.002
The only one so far
that came back stolen.

32:16.035 --> 32:18.437
- Came off an Army Reserve base
out in Arlington Heights.

32:18.470 --> 32:20.272
The suspected thief
is a reservist

32:20.306 --> 32:22.208
by the name of
John Lee Radigan.

32:22.241 --> 32:24.543
He was an Army Ranger, joined
the reserves two years ago

32:24.576 --> 32:25.611
when he got back
from Afghanistan.

32:25.644 --> 32:28.147
Went AWOL from reservist
training six months back.

32:28.180 --> 32:30.382
- Ladies and gentlemen,
our third operative:

32:30.416 --> 32:31.550
a trained killer.

32:31.583 --> 32:33.585
- The colonel on the base
said it was an internal matter,

32:33.619 --> 32:35.621
but he did give us
Radigan's LKA:

32:35.654 --> 32:37.523
an apartment in Oak Park.

32:37.556 --> 32:39.658
- Send us the address.

32:39.691 --> 32:40.826
Hold on, Atwater.

32:40.859 --> 32:44.196
I want you to go to the Streets
and Sanitation truck lot.

32:44.230 --> 32:46.132
You call me as soon
as you get there.

32:46.165 --> 32:48.300
Just do it.

32:58.344 --> 33:00.146
All right,
this guy is heavily armed,

33:00.179 --> 33:02.081
so watch your backs.

33:05.684 --> 33:07.619
We got eyes on Radigan.

33:14.693 --> 33:16.762
- Question is,
has he got eyes on us?

33:20.332 --> 33:22.301
- We're a minute out with squad.
Should we move in?

33:22.334 --> 33:24.303
- Negative.
He's in a bulletproof,

33:24.336 --> 33:25.437
bombproof vehicle.

33:25.471 --> 33:28.074
He's probably sitting in
the safest place in the city.

33:28.107 --> 33:29.408
Just be ready
to pursue.

33:29.441 --> 33:32.178
[car engine starting]

33:34.746 --> 33:37.183
- What the hell
is he doing?

33:37.216 --> 33:40.286
[tires screeching]

33:43.255 --> 33:46.192
- Squad, 2051 in pursuit
of Radigan's vehicle.

33:46.225 --> 33:50.829
[tires screeching]

33:50.862 --> 33:52.731
Erin,
he's taking a left on Damen.

33:54.466 --> 33:55.467
- Got it.

34:00.106 --> 34:01.307
[car horn blares]

34:03.375 --> 34:06.445
[siren blaring]

34:08.414 --> 34:11.283
- Voight,
he's coming back to you.

34:11.317 --> 34:13.452
[sirens blaring]

34:15.521 --> 34:16.722
- Shoot out the tires!

34:20.626 --> 34:24.730
[gunfire]

34:24.763 --> 34:26.764
Let's go!

34:30.601 --> 34:32.138
Atwater, you in position?

34:32.170 --> 34:33.539
- Yes, sir.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.641
[horn blaring]

34:35.674 --> 34:37.143
- Take it, now!

34:37.176 --> 34:39.178
- Copy that.

34:45.451 --> 34:48.520
[sirens blaring]

34:53.458 --> 34:55.694
CPD!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't move.

35:03.235 --> 35:03.402
.

35:03.435 --> 35:03.735
- I got it.

35:05.704 --> 35:10.142
State's attorney is gonna have
to figure out your charges.

35:10.176 --> 35:13.279
I mean, if you're lucky,
he'll, uh,

35:13.312 --> 35:15.347
he'll drop the murder charge
down to manslaughter

35:15.381 --> 35:19.151
since you're, you know,

35:19.185 --> 35:21.853
following the orders of a guy
who's mentally unstable.

35:21.887 --> 35:24.290
- You interfered with
an operation

35:24.323 --> 35:27.826
sanctioned by the CIA.

35:27.859 --> 35:29.861
- If you're CIA...

35:37.203 --> 35:39.438
How come nobody's come here
to get you out?

35:39.471 --> 35:41.773
- Oh, don't worry.

35:41.807 --> 35:44.910
They will.

35:44.943 --> 35:49.481
And when they do...

35:49.515 --> 35:51.417
I'll have your badge.

35:55.254 --> 35:58.957
- You know...

35:58.990 --> 36:01.627
I can't tell you how many times
I looked into that cage

36:01.660 --> 36:06.332
at, you know, murderers,
rapists, pedophiles,

36:06.365 --> 36:10.236
sitting, I mean,
right where you're sitting.

36:10.269 --> 36:13.539
And you'd think--you'd think

36:13.572 --> 36:15.474
that after all these years
that I'd be--

36:15.507 --> 36:17.343
I'd be an expert
in psychology,

36:17.376 --> 36:20.446
but I tell you the truth...

36:20.479 --> 36:22.381
I mean, I--

36:22.414 --> 36:25.484
I-I don't think I'll ever
understand what makes them tick.

36:27.819 --> 36:29.888
You, I think I get.

36:29.921 --> 36:31.923
You're not a bad guy.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.862
You're just...

36:39.398 --> 36:40.932
Looking for something
to believe in.

36:48.974 --> 36:50.008
Okay.

36:50.041 --> 36:52.010
- Right up the middle.

36:52.043 --> 36:54.780
Keep driving those uppercuts
right through the middle.

36:54.813 --> 36:56.782
Use your hips,
use your legs.

36:56.815 --> 36:58.950
Keep throwing!
All the way through.

37:00.386 --> 37:02.888
Keep throwing.
- Okay, okay.

37:02.921 --> 37:03.889
Hey.
- Good job.

37:03.922 --> 37:05.924
- Thanks.

37:08.994 --> 37:11.697
Hey, Antonio told me
what happened.

37:11.730 --> 37:14.700
- Oh, watch the ribs, kiddo.
- Oh, sorry.

37:14.733 --> 37:16.001
I was really worried
about you.

37:16.034 --> 37:19.638
- Well, I'm gonna--
I'm gonna take you to dinner.

37:19.671 --> 37:22.341
- Okay.
Okay, I'll go get cleaned up.

37:22.374 --> 37:24.376
- Okay.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.856
- We've got him on
a morphine drip,

38:10.889 --> 38:13.992
so he won't feel
any pain.

38:14.025 --> 38:16.462
I'm afraid he won't make it
through the night.

38:20.766 --> 38:23.769
I'll give you two
some time.

38:26.672 --> 38:29.441
- [sobs]

38:33.745 --> 38:37.015
I just want to thank you.

38:37.048 --> 38:40.419
- For what?

38:40.452 --> 38:42.921
- For making him happy

38:42.954 --> 38:45.724
these last few days.

38:59.137 --> 39:02.574
- You want to see me, boss?
- Yeah, come on in.

39:08.580 --> 39:11.049
I think you might
need those.

39:11.082 --> 39:12.518
- I'm reinstated?

39:12.551 --> 39:15.421
- Full duty.
- [exhales deeply]

39:16.522 --> 39:18.624
- Just got off the phone
with Deputy Crowley.

39:18.657 --> 39:22.661
She's decided to drop
the investigation on your case.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.830
- [chuckles]

39:24.863 --> 39:26.932
I don't know what favors
you had to pull

39:26.965 --> 39:29.535
to make this happen, boss,
but thank you, thank you.

39:29.568 --> 39:31.603
Serving in this unit has been
nothing short of an honor.

39:31.637 --> 39:32.938
- Adam...
- I'm gonna be the first one in,

39:32.971 --> 39:33.805
last one to leave.

39:33.839 --> 39:35.641
You need anything at all,
I'm your guy.

39:35.674 --> 39:37.609
- Adam.
- Yeah?

39:37.643 --> 39:39.478
- She's the one
you should be thanking.

39:46.585 --> 39:48.119
- How'd you make this happen,
Sarge?

39:48.153 --> 39:50.188
- Crowley and I go way back.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.491
She's always been
a ball-breaker...

39:52.524 --> 39:54.826
Which, of course,
is why I like her.

39:57.162 --> 39:58.830
- I appreciate it.

40:04.069 --> 40:07.105
[chuckles]

40:10.809 --> 40:12.678
- He's worth it, Trudy.

40:12.711 --> 40:15.747
Trust me.

40:15.781 --> 40:17.616
- Yeah, I know.

40:23.855 --> 40:27.459
- Hi. So, Jay, I'm not usually
the match-making type guy,

40:27.493 --> 40:30.529
but my wife wants to
set you up with somebody.

40:30.562 --> 40:33.131
- Whoa, Herrmann,
what's wrong with me?

40:33.164 --> 40:34.566
- Slow down.
Who--who is it?

40:34.600 --> 40:36.768
- She's a great gal.
She's cute, you know?

40:36.802 --> 40:38.737
And she's in
my wife's bridge club.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.205
- [chuckles]
Okay, I take it back.

40:40.238 --> 40:42.140
Jay, you can have her.
[laughing]

40:42.173 --> 40:44.175
- Shut up.
- Thanks.

40:44.209 --> 40:46.478
- Yeah, you're out?
All right. Hey.

40:46.512 --> 40:48.714
- Hey.

40:48.747 --> 40:51.683
- I thought--I thought you were
gonna call it an early night.

40:51.717 --> 40:53.552
- Here you go.
- Thanks, Herrmann.

40:53.585 --> 40:55.186
- Yep.

40:55.220 --> 40:57.088
- I just figured I would
come by.

40:57.122 --> 40:59.190
Maybe you'd be here.

40:59.224 --> 41:00.526
- What we were
talking about earlier,

41:00.559 --> 41:04.195
the whole, uh,
one-time thing,

41:04.229 --> 41:09.701
so is that like one time
a week, one time a day?

41:09.735 --> 41:11.970
- You're funny.

41:12.003 --> 41:14.272
- All I'm saying is why--
why are we dancing around?

41:14.305 --> 41:16.107
Voight doesn't have
a problem with it.

41:16.141 --> 41:18.544
Everybody knows,

41:18.577 --> 41:20.846
so why are we still
trying to hide it?

41:24.750 --> 41:25.651
- That's a good point.

41:27.218 --> 41:29.521
Do you want to
hold my hand in public now?

41:44.736 --> 41:46.738
Or that.
[chuckles]

41:59.050 --> 42:02.888
We should get out of here.
- Mm-hmm.

42:02.921 --> 42:04.856
- [chuckles]

42:05.305 --> 42:11.878
