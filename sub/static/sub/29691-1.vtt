WEBVTT

00:30.200 --> 00:33.240
SEVENTEEN

01:37.440 --> 01:38.840
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:39.040 --> 01:43.920
we'll be closing our doors
in a few minutes.

04:00.280 --> 04:01.880
Three to control.

04:02.280 --> 04:04.520
Alarm in the appliance department.

04:08.560 --> 04:09.680
Shit!

04:21.959 --> 04:23.600
Hey! Stop!

05:05.360 --> 05:06.520
"Tarapara."

05:12.560 --> 05:13.800
"Tarapara."

05:17.200 --> 05:19.080
How many times
have you been here, Héctor?

05:19.680 --> 05:20.560
Seven.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.400
And what did I say the last time?

05:23.880 --> 05:25.080
A lot of things.

05:25.240 --> 05:28.200
The very last thing before I let you go.

05:30.240 --> 05:31.960
That there’d be no concessions next time.

05:32.960 --> 05:35.760
And the previous time, what did I say?

05:36.360 --> 05:38.120
That there’d be no concessions next time.

05:39.480 --> 05:41.360
So, what do you conclude?

05:43.600 --> 05:44.600
That you lie.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.920
Do you know the difference
between right and wrong?

05:49.640 --> 05:52.600
My grandmother's heater
at the nursing home was broken.

05:52.960 --> 05:54.920
Is that right or wrong?

05:55.400 --> 05:56.320
Wrong.

05:58.280 --> 06:00.840
And stealing a scooter?

06:01.040 --> 06:02.280
And breaking into a mall?

06:02.480 --> 06:05.360
And possession of a weapon?

06:05.560 --> 06:07.640
And robbery with violence?

06:09.000 --> 06:11.480
You seriously injured a security guard.

06:11.920 --> 06:12.880
He hit his head

06:13.040 --> 06:15.040
and spent three days
in an induced coma.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.000
I didn't touch him. It was his fault.

06:17.320 --> 06:19.400
Just tell me it’s wrong.

06:19.560 --> 06:22.400
My grandma’s spent three weeks
waiting for her heater to be fixed.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.600
And that justifies anything you do?

06:25.160 --> 06:26.400
No, I guess not.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.360
I shouldn't have taken
the electric shaver.

06:31.680 --> 06:32.800
Why am I here?

06:32.960 --> 06:34.440
What do you mean? Aren’t you listening?

06:34.600 --> 06:35.640
Who reported me?

06:35.880 --> 06:37.320
Was it my brother?

06:44.040 --> 06:45.440
I bet it was you.

06:47.880 --> 06:50.840
Look, this is the Criminal Code.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.480
This includes everything you can't do.

06:53.640 --> 06:55.680
If it’s in here, it’s wrong.

06:56.040 --> 06:58.800
Here. Take it with you
to where I'm sending you.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.920
Because when you get out
in two years, you'll be an adult

07:02.080 --> 07:04.320
and you'll have to face
all the consequences.

07:04.720 --> 07:07.040
So I advise you to memorize it.

07:20.920 --> 07:22.640
Good morning. Let's go.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.760
-It's too early.
-No excuses, come on.

07:26.840 --> 07:29.280
-Good morning. Come on, Mario.
-Shit.

07:31.520 --> 07:32.600
Good morning, Héctor.

07:36.360 --> 07:38.000
CRIMINAL CODE

07:52.440 --> 07:55.600
Lawyer, share some articles,
don’t eat them all.

07:56.880 --> 07:58.520
Hey, hey, keep quiet.

07:58.680 --> 08:00.320
And stop laughing.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.400
You'll be needing him to get you
out of trouble in a few years.

08:03.560 --> 08:06.920
Our asses will be reformed
when we get out of here.

08:08.440 --> 08:09.520
Stop,

08:10.440 --> 08:11.720
think

08:12.720 --> 08:14.200
and respond.

08:15.800 --> 08:18.840
Hearing is not the same as listening.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.160
If we follow our instincts,
we're making a mistake.

08:23.280 --> 08:24.800
This is our toolbox

08:25.000 --> 08:28.360
and it's the only way for us
to avoid conflict.

08:28.680 --> 08:30.600
You have to learn to think.

08:30.760 --> 08:34.039
To detect antisocial, automatic thought,

08:34.200 --> 08:36.600
toxic thoughts, and eliminate them

08:36.760 --> 08:38.799
before they take hold inside of you

08:39.720 --> 08:43.240
to change them
into pro-social and efficient thoughts.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.560
LAWYER - FAILURE
RETARD...

08:45.720 --> 08:47.680
You're on the edge of adolescence

08:48.320 --> 08:50.840
and soon you'll be entering
adulthood without warning.

08:51.040 --> 08:53.840
What's going on here? What's so funny?

08:54.040 --> 08:55.280
Let's see.

08:55.520 --> 08:57.600
Héctor, please, sit down.

08:59.120 --> 09:01.160
Do you want me to call security?

10:10.400 --> 10:11.960
Motherfucker!

10:39.520 --> 10:41.840
-There goes the lawyer again!
-Hey, where are you going?

10:42.000 --> 10:43.200
Stop!

10:50.600 --> 10:51.920
Come on, let's go!

11:15.360 --> 11:17.520
Stop! Stop! Stop!

11:19.000 --> 11:20.360
There he is!

11:23.920 --> 11:25.880
Go, go, let’s go!

12:12.080 --> 12:13.840
Welcome home, bastard.

12:14.040 --> 12:16.080
Did you beat your record, lawyer?

12:16.240 --> 12:19.200
Welcome back, you dawg!

12:30.000 --> 12:31.480
Is this game you've made up

12:31.640 --> 12:33.720
really worth a week of isolation?

12:34.280 --> 12:36.480
Can you bring me eight rolls
of Scotch tape?

12:37.320 --> 12:38.680
Well, make it ten.

13:24.120 --> 13:24.960
Let's go.

13:31.920 --> 13:35.400
Keep walking. Good.
Keep going, in back. Good.

13:35.800 --> 13:37.040
Okay, good.

13:37.840 --> 13:38.960
That's it.

13:39.400 --> 13:42.320
Keep going, that's it, in back.

13:42.480 --> 13:45.160
How was your week off?

13:45.320 --> 13:47.600
Good, good, keep walking.

13:48.280 --> 13:50.280
Well? You want to join them?

13:50.440 --> 13:52.920
The dogs are for the disability ward.

13:53.120 --> 13:54.040
No.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.880
No, they're for anyone
with trouble relating.

13:58.840 --> 14:00.240
What do you have to do?

14:01.160 --> 14:04.240
Take care of them, walk them,
play with them,

14:04.560 --> 14:06.120
teach them tricks.

14:06.280 --> 14:07.320
Relate to them,

14:08.320 --> 14:09.280
share with them.

14:10.240 --> 14:12.040
-Will they stay here?
-No.

14:12.320 --> 14:14.240
They're coming once a week.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.400
I don't know how to take care of dogs.

14:16.560 --> 14:18.560
That's the point, to learn.

14:20.760 --> 14:21.960
There aren't any dogs free.

14:22.120 --> 14:24.440
No? I think there's one left.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.840
Let's take a look.

14:27.440 --> 14:28.240
Shall we?

14:29.360 --> 14:30.400
Thanks.

14:34.720 --> 14:35.440
-Hi.
-Hi.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.040
-You're Roman, right?
-Yeah.

14:37.200 --> 14:39.280
-Can we see the last free dog?
-Sure.

14:39.600 --> 14:42.160
We rescued it this morning
on the way here.

14:45.520 --> 14:48.640
Which article of the Criminal Code
punishes cruelty and abandonment?

14:48.800 --> 14:50.600
337.

14:51.600 --> 14:55.400
The owners of all these dogs
violated Article 337.

14:57.080 --> 14:59.200
Why should I learn how
to take care of a dog?

14:59.360 --> 15:02.080
To learn how to take care of yourself.

15:03.600 --> 15:05.000
Are you calling me a dog?

15:05.560 --> 15:06.920
Kind of, yeah.

15:08.520 --> 15:11.280
I was going to give you some crap
about identification, but...

15:11.760 --> 15:13.520
-No, save it.
-Yeah.

15:14.040 --> 15:15.960
I'll save it.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.280
What's its name?

15:18.440 --> 15:21.360
It still doesn't have one.
You can give it one.

15:21.920 --> 15:25.280
Should we let him out?
He's friendly and gentle.

15:26.520 --> 15:27.880
It looks like a sheep.

15:28.760 --> 15:30.200
Don't you dare call him that.

15:30.920 --> 15:33.720
Come on, don't step on each other.

15:33.880 --> 15:36.200
Look at the dog.
Fran, he knows he's your dog.

15:36.560 --> 15:37.680
Come on, look at the dog.

15:38.560 --> 15:40.760
Look at the dog, watch the dog.

15:40.920 --> 15:43.040
Keep going, keep going.

15:43.200 --> 15:45.800
Look, the lawyer with the retards!

15:46.040 --> 15:47.400
Finally found his place in the world!

15:47.480 --> 15:49.320
What are you doing? Shut up.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.560
Get lost, you're just jealous.

15:51.720 --> 15:53.800
Come on, keep going, keep going.

15:53.960 --> 15:55.200
Keep walking, let's go.

15:55.840 --> 15:59.080
Come on, keep going.

15:59.240 --> 16:01.680
Good, come on, keep going.

16:02.200 --> 16:03.600
No stopping. No stopping.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.080
Héctor.

16:07.240 --> 16:09.520
Here, he was waiting for you. Okay.

16:09.680 --> 16:12.080
Let's go over there and make a circle.

16:12.240 --> 16:14.400
Sheep. Sheep.

16:14.960 --> 16:17.800
Say his name and feed him
so he'll start learning his name.

16:17.960 --> 16:19.720
-Sheep.
-Good.

16:19.880 --> 16:21.520
From the head to the tail first.

16:23.520 --> 16:25.400
Sit. Sit.

16:25.720 --> 16:27.800
Right there, that's it, good.

16:34.240 --> 16:35.080
Paw.

16:35.600 --> 16:36.560
Sheep.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.400
-Sit.
-That's it, good.

16:43.560 --> 16:44.720
Perfect, great.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.800
Come on, Sheep. Let's go.

16:50.600 --> 16:52.360
Before we start, it's essential

16:52.520 --> 16:54.720
for the dog to know
how to sit and come here.

17:05.480 --> 17:07.000
You don't want to play?

17:33.400 --> 17:34.360
Hi, hi.

17:39.760 --> 17:41.040
CANINE BEHAVIOR

17:49.720 --> 17:52.440
Your gums look good,
but you have some plaque.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.160
Jump, jump!

17:57.120 --> 17:58.760
You don't want to play?

17:59.320 --> 18:00.200
That's okay.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.440
I don't want to either.

18:11.520 --> 18:12.760
Sheep.

18:15.240 --> 18:16.160
Hi.

18:16.320 --> 18:18.080
Sheep. Stay.

18:21.520 --> 18:22.720
Turn around. Good.

18:57.400 --> 18:58.840
You should be happy.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.560
-Why?
-Because he's been adopted.

19:00.720 --> 19:02.360
And it's thanks to you.

19:02.520 --> 19:05.200
You made him sociable,
obedient and affectionate.

19:05.760 --> 19:08.000
And now he's finally found
a home, an owner.

19:08.160 --> 19:09.760
-I'm his owner.
-Héctor,

19:09.920 --> 19:12.160
I told you from the start
the dogs aren't yours.

19:12.320 --> 19:15.320
They're here to help you.
And Sheep helped you, right?

19:15.480 --> 19:17.040
And you helped him.
Focus on that.

19:17.200 --> 19:19.840
You're good at taking care
of dogs and training them.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.240
Look, we brought you another dog.
You can take care of this one.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.440
I don't want to train another dog.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.080
I want to train my dog.

19:27.840 --> 19:28.880
Héctor.

20:26.760 --> 20:28.360
Héctor, don't.

20:29.000 --> 20:29.920
Héctor, wait...

20:30.080 --> 20:32.120
-Héctor!
-There goes the lawyer!

20:32.280 --> 20:33.720
Héctor, stop!

20:34.280 --> 20:35.360
Stop!

20:36.080 --> 20:37.640
Héctor!

20:38.480 --> 20:39.480
Héctor!

20:41.960 --> 20:43.240
Héctor!

21:28.720 --> 21:30.160
Come here!

21:32.200 --> 21:33.120
Let's go.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.520
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

22:37.840 --> 22:39.160
FOR SALE

22:58.320 --> 22:59.360
Yes?

23:06.800 --> 23:08.040
When did he run away?

23:08.200 --> 23:09.280
Yesterday afternoon.

23:09.440 --> 23:12.400
We waited all night,
in case it was just a tantrum.

23:12.560 --> 23:14.920
He's done it plenty of times,
but he always gave up

23:15.080 --> 23:16.800
-or came back.
-Plenty of times?

23:17.520 --> 23:18.560
21 including this time.

23:19.600 --> 23:20.880
What for?

23:21.040 --> 23:23.440
He prefers to be in isolation,
even just a few days,

23:23.600 --> 23:24.880
than live with the rest.

23:25.040 --> 23:27.240
Typical of him. Very typical.

23:27.920 --> 23:30.080
We had to call Juvenile Hall
and the police.

23:30.240 --> 23:31.920
No way...

23:32.120 --> 23:33.800
He's getting out soon, right?

23:34.000 --> 23:36.440
-Yeah, in less than two months.
-Then why did he do it?

23:36.600 --> 23:37.560
I think it has

23:38.240 --> 23:39.720
something to do with a dog.

23:40.040 --> 23:41.640
-With a dog?
-Yes.

23:41.800 --> 23:42.880
Sheep.

23:43.040 --> 23:43.920
Good lord.

23:44.440 --> 23:47.280
That's not the problem, the problem is

23:47.440 --> 23:49.160
it's his birthday in two days.

23:49.320 --> 23:50.680
He'll be 18 years old.

23:51.160 --> 23:53.240
If he commits a crime after that,

23:53.400 --> 23:55.520
he'll be judged as an adult.

23:55.680 --> 23:59.080
But if he does it before,
even if he's judged as a minor,

23:59.240 --> 24:01.760
the judge can put him in a penitentiary.

24:01.920 --> 24:04.240
And with his record, it's probable.

24:04.560 --> 24:07.000
I would try to make sure
he stays out of trouble

24:07.160 --> 24:08.960
and comes back voluntarily,

24:09.120 --> 24:11.440
which would be seen as
spontaneous regret

24:11.600 --> 24:13.280
with lesser consequences.

24:13.720 --> 24:16.120
I don't understand. I'm sorry, but...

24:18.680 --> 24:19.840
Has he contacted you?

24:20.040 --> 24:21.760
No, and he won't.

24:22.480 --> 24:24.120
Do you know where he might have gone?

24:28.600 --> 24:30.880
He named a dog Sheep?

24:32.520 --> 24:33.400
Yeah.

24:45.080 --> 24:46.480
Hi.

24:54.720 --> 24:55.680
Hi, Grandma.

24:56.560 --> 24:58.080
"Tarapara."

24:59.280 --> 25:00.600
Did Héctor stop by?

25:06.480 --> 25:08.400
Don't lie to me, Grandma.

25:09.080 --> 25:10.720
You always defend him.

25:10.880 --> 25:13.360
He hasn't shown up whining to watch TV

25:13.520 --> 25:16.080
and steal your candy like
whenever he has a tantrum?

25:21.600 --> 25:24.120
No, because he's grown up.

25:24.880 --> 25:29.440
He's stopped being a dumbass, right?
He's quit his bullshit.

25:29.920 --> 25:32.080
Come out from under the fucking bed.

25:32.840 --> 25:34.680
Come out, damn it!

25:40.520 --> 25:41.840
You wear me out.

25:42.680 --> 25:43.960
You wear me out.

25:44.120 --> 25:45.160
What the fuck are you doing here?

25:45.320 --> 25:46.960
-Visiting Grandma.
-Look.

25:47.120 --> 25:48.040
-Let's go.
-No.

25:49.280 --> 25:51.760
They called the police.
They'll be here any minute.

25:51.920 --> 25:52.800
-I'm leaving.
-Yeah.

25:53.040 --> 25:53.960
Back to the center with me.

25:54.120 --> 25:55.600
-Right now.
-I'm not going back.

25:55.760 --> 25:57.040
What? Are you fucking stupid?

25:57.200 --> 25:58.080
"Tarapara."

25:58.640 --> 26:00.520
She doesn't like us swearing.

26:00.680 --> 26:03.000
Why the fuck did you run away?
Explain that to me.

26:03.160 --> 26:04.840
And don't say because of the dog.

26:05.480 --> 26:06.760
Then I won't tell you.

26:06.920 --> 26:08.240
Was it really the dog?

26:08.640 --> 26:10.040
You said not to tell you.

26:10.200 --> 26:12.080
I can't believe it, you ran away...

26:12.240 --> 26:14.680
No, tell me. Please, tell me now.

26:15.040 --> 26:17.160
Tell me you ran away
because of some shitty dog.

26:17.280 --> 26:18.480
He's not a shitty dog.

26:18.640 --> 26:20.320
He's my dog and they took him from me.

26:20.480 --> 26:21.720
He's not your dog.

26:21.880 --> 26:23.520
He's mine and I'm going to get him back.

26:23.680 --> 26:25.480
Oh, right. What's your plan?

26:25.640 --> 26:27.760
I'll ask the dog shelter who stole him.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.480
You think the pound will tell you
who adopted him?

26:30.640 --> 26:33.320
The dog shelter.
I didn't say I'd ask where he is.

26:33.480 --> 26:34.120
Damn it!

26:37.240 --> 26:40.240
You have a month and a half left.
Can't you please wait?

26:40.400 --> 26:41.240
No.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.360
You know what will happen
if you get caught?

26:43.520 --> 26:45.680
-Want to hear what they said?
-I won't get caught.

26:46.320 --> 26:48.360
Unless you report me like last time.

26:58.680 --> 26:59.680
Come on, Mr. My Way.

26:59.840 --> 27:00.640
Where?

27:01.480 --> 27:04.600
To the pound.
Or dog shelter. I'll take you.

27:04.920 --> 27:06.480
Let’s execute your shitty plan.

27:06.640 --> 27:08.080
We have to take Grandma.

27:08.600 --> 27:09.400
What?

27:09.560 --> 27:10.520
She's dying.

27:10.680 --> 27:13.200
Héctor, she's been dying
for 5 years since her stroke.

27:13.360 --> 27:14.480
You're dying, aren't you?

27:14.640 --> 27:16.280
-"Tarapara."
-You see?

27:16.440 --> 27:18.240
Look, that's enough nonsense.

27:18.400 --> 27:20.080
Doctors don't speak nonsense.

27:20.560 --> 27:22.360
Everyone thinks she doesn't understand.

27:22.520 --> 27:24.280
-But she does.
-"Tarapara."

27:25.760 --> 27:28.480
Her oxygen level has dropped to 78%.

27:28.640 --> 27:30.640
If it drops below 70% she will die.

27:30.800 --> 27:32.360
I don't know about medicine,

27:32.520 --> 27:34.240
it's what the doctors said.
In front of her.

27:34.400 --> 27:35.720
I was under the bed.

27:38.920 --> 27:41.320
She's taken care of us all our lives.

27:41.480 --> 27:43.480
She's never asked for anything in return.

27:43.800 --> 27:46.880
Only to be buried with Grandpa Chiri
and not to swear.

27:47.040 --> 27:49.200
We promised her. Both of us.

27:49.720 --> 27:50.760
Okay.

27:51.120 --> 27:52.200
When she dies, we'll do it.

27:52.360 --> 27:54.120
You're going to let her die alone?

27:54.280 --> 27:56.600
I won't let her die alone.
Grandma is sacred.

27:59.200 --> 28:01.480
We can't just take her with us, Héctor.

28:01.640 --> 28:02.480
Yes, we can.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.720
You request voluntary release,
they give you a wheelchair,

28:04.880 --> 28:07.160
an oxygen tank with batteries
and a portable oximeter.

28:07.320 --> 28:10.160
And you return it later.
I stole some sedatives

28:10.320 --> 28:12.760
just in case, because I don't know
if they'll give us any.

28:13.280 --> 28:16.080
A pill under her tongue
every 12 hours to relax her.

28:17.280 --> 28:19.360
What do you fucking want?

28:19.800 --> 28:22.120
To get your dog
or bury Grandma back home?

28:23.160 --> 28:24.360
Both.

28:24.520 --> 28:26.560
For fuck’s sake,
we're off to a great start.

28:30.240 --> 28:31.080
Two days.

28:31.600 --> 28:33.680
In two days you're an adult
and there you are.

28:33.840 --> 28:36.720
-Where?
-Wherever you want, Héctor.

28:36.880 --> 28:38.160
But without me.

28:38.600 --> 28:39.760
Then it's just like always.

28:41.800 --> 28:43.960
You didn't steal this, I did.

28:44.120 --> 28:47.560
Listen to me. You can't commit
a crime until we go back to the center.

28:48.200 --> 28:49.240
You got it?

28:51.280 --> 28:53.440
Not "mmm." You got it, yes or no?

28:55.320 --> 28:56.480
Yes.

28:56.640 --> 28:57.920
"Tarapara."

28:59.120 --> 29:00.440
Even Grandma said yes.

29:01.080 --> 29:02.320
She didn't say yes,

29:02.480 --> 29:03.760
she said we'll see.

29:49.240 --> 29:52.040
-What's the dog place called?
-"Asproan."

29:52.440 --> 29:53.800
We have to take the 231,

29:53.960 --> 29:55.640
the 623 and the 234.

29:55.800 --> 29:58.520
Forget the numbers,
we'll take the highway, it's much faster.

29:58.680 --> 30:00.680
No, there are more police on the highway.

30:00.840 --> 30:02.280
We have to take back roads.

30:02.440 --> 30:03.840
What if I hadn't shown up?

30:04.000 --> 30:06.680
How would you have done all this alone?

30:06.840 --> 30:07.840
I don't know.

30:08.480 --> 30:09.640
-You don't know?
-No, I don't.

30:09.800 --> 30:11.840
-You know everything but this.
-No.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.760
Why do you ask me everything twice?

30:13.920 --> 30:15.360
So you'll improve your answer.

30:15.760 --> 30:18.360
So you can think of a better answer.

30:21.360 --> 30:22.720
Why did you bring the camper?

30:23.520 --> 30:25.080
To drive it and see if anyone will buy it.

30:25.240 --> 30:27.640
You said you'd give it to me
when I turned 18.

30:27.800 --> 30:30.200
Yeah, after you swore not to get
in trouble ever again.

30:30.360 --> 30:32.800
Did you keep your side? That's right.

30:34.040 --> 30:35.000
Did Marta dump you?

30:35.160 --> 30:36.840
What are you saying?

30:37.000 --> 30:38.600
Is that why you're living in the camper?

30:38.760 --> 30:40.200
Marta didn't dump me
and I'm not living in the camper.

30:40.360 --> 30:42.080
I can tell you are. You're living here.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.120
-No, I'm not.
-Because she dumped you.

30:44.280 --> 30:46.160
Okay, are we going to sit here and argue?

30:46.320 --> 30:48.400
Fine with me. We won't go after the dog.

30:49.160 --> 30:51.320
We'll just stay here.
Don't worry about it.

30:53.440 --> 30:54.720
I knew you would come.

30:55.200 --> 30:56.840
-What?
-I knew you would come.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.080
This is my second answer.
Is it better than the first?

31:00.920 --> 31:01.840
Not at all.

31:02.640 --> 31:04.000
Then don't ask twice.

31:32.040 --> 31:32.920
That's it.

31:44.480 --> 31:46.280
-Leave the motor running.
-What for?

31:46.360 --> 31:47.560
In case we have to make a run for it.

31:48.200 --> 31:50.360
Make a run for it?
We're not running anywhere.

31:51.440 --> 31:54.680
And I'm going in alone. Stay here.
They probably called them.

31:54.840 --> 31:56.080
If they see you, they'll call the police.

31:56.240 --> 31:57.400
What will you do?

31:57.560 --> 32:00.240
-Something you've never done.
-Kill?

32:00.400 --> 32:02.760
Ask... politely.

32:02.920 --> 32:04.720
It won't work. You said so yourself.

32:04.880 --> 32:06.400
No, I said it wouldn't work for you.

32:06.560 --> 32:08.520
Because you can't talk with reason.

32:08.680 --> 32:10.480
You get confused and screw up

32:10.840 --> 32:14.600
and only understand things your way,
which is always the wrong way.

32:14.760 --> 32:16.720
Okay, but leave the motor running.

32:18.040 --> 32:19.360
And listen.

32:19.520 --> 32:21.600
If you don't listen,
no one will listen to you.

32:27.720 --> 32:29.920
Don't you dare hotwire it, I know you.

32:49.640 --> 32:51.240
-Hi there.
-Hello.

32:51.400 --> 32:52.680
Have you got a moment?

32:52.840 --> 32:54.360
-Yeah, sure.
-Look.

32:54.520 --> 32:56.240
The thing is, my...

32:57.720 --> 33:01.400
girlfriend came last week to adopt a dog

33:01.560 --> 33:04.720
and she fell in love with one,
I think his name is Sheep,

33:04.880 --> 33:07.200
I'm not sure. And I was hoping...

33:07.360 --> 33:08.520
He was adopted.

33:09.880 --> 33:11.480
That's what I thought.

33:12.160 --> 33:14.840
Do you think there's any chance

33:15.040 --> 33:16.560
I can contact whoever...?

33:16.720 --> 33:19.360
No, we can't give out that information.

33:19.520 --> 33:21.240
That sucks.

33:21.520 --> 33:25.560
You can't imagine how much
she liked the dog...

33:25.720 --> 33:27.440
-Why didn't she adopt him?
-Because

33:27.600 --> 33:31.320
she wanted to ask me first
so we would both be sure...

33:31.480 --> 33:32.760
The thing is, people don't come here

33:33.400 --> 33:35.160
to choose. They come to adopt.

33:35.480 --> 33:37.400
And when they have to consult someone

33:37.560 --> 33:40.800
or fall for one dog in particular,
they don't want to adopt.

33:40.960 --> 33:42.640
That's a little radical, isn't it?

33:42.800 --> 33:43.800
Yes,

33:44.000 --> 33:46.520
because their situation is radical.

33:47.360 --> 33:49.000
I'm sorry, but you can't doubt here.

33:49.520 --> 33:52.840
You know how many people change
their minds and return dogs?

33:53.000 --> 33:53.880
Right.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.240
Anyway, forget it.

33:59.400 --> 34:00.440
Hello?

34:01.840 --> 34:03.400
Where did they find it?

34:03.840 --> 34:04.640
Okay.

34:04.800 --> 34:08.520
First you have to go to a vet
to see if he has a microchip.

34:09.560 --> 34:10.360
The dog, yeah.

34:16.560 --> 34:18.159
Grandma, don't die until I come back.

34:18.320 --> 34:20.040
"Tarapara."

35:01.040 --> 35:03.600
Think it through before leaving it there.

35:03.760 --> 35:07.080
If nobody claims it in ten days...

35:09.920 --> 35:11.240
Exactly.

35:17.920 --> 35:20.640
ADOPTION FILES

35:47.080 --> 35:48.760
Where the fuck is Héctor?

35:48.920 --> 35:50.040
"Tarapara."

35:50.200 --> 35:52.080
"Tarapara" my ass!

35:55.160 --> 35:56.200
What the fuck are you doing?

35:56.360 --> 35:57.920
I said to leave the motor running.

35:59.680 --> 36:03.120
Hey, come back with that dog, you bastard!

36:13.520 --> 36:15.200
What the fuck did you do?

36:15.920 --> 36:16.840
I took a dog.

36:17.000 --> 36:17.880
I can see that. What for?

36:18.040 --> 36:19.760
-For the exchange.
-What exchange?

36:19.920 --> 36:22.720
When we find Sheep, we'll say
the shelter made a mistake

36:22.880 --> 36:24.520
and gave them my dog, but it's okay

36:24.680 --> 36:26.760
because we brought another one
to exchange.

36:26.920 --> 36:29.800
Fantastic. You're a genius.
Everyone's happy.

36:29.960 --> 36:31.360
That's right, everyone's happy.

36:33.080 --> 36:35.640
-He's missing a leg.
-I know.

36:35.800 --> 36:37.120
Do you think that will help?

36:37.280 --> 36:38.640
It helped me choose him.

36:38.800 --> 36:41.160
Because you're missing a leg too,
a leg called "brain."

36:42.120 --> 36:43.200
And you're missing...

36:43.360 --> 36:46.200
Say it and I'll dump you right here
with the three-legged dog.

36:47.120 --> 36:48.200
Don't you dare say it.

36:50.120 --> 36:51.440
Heart.

36:57.560 --> 36:58.640
Should I get out?

37:01.880 --> 37:03.320
I thought you were going to say balls.

37:03.800 --> 37:06.080
Balls wouldn't be one leg,

37:06.600 --> 37:07.560
it would be two.

37:08.760 --> 37:11.520
You think I'd be doing all this
if I had no heart?

37:13.320 --> 37:15.200
Maybe you're trying to get it back.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.200
You didn't steal the dog, you got that?

37:20.400 --> 37:21.560
I stole it.

37:21.920 --> 37:23.640
The file and the dog.

37:24.120 --> 37:25.160
Got it?

37:26.840 --> 37:27.680
Got it.

37:50.760 --> 37:53.600
What was the last day
you were with the dog?

37:53.760 --> 37:55.640
Last Wednesday.

37:55.800 --> 37:58.000
Since Wednesday
people have adopted Gnome,

37:58.600 --> 37:59.840
Toy,

38:00.000 --> 38:02.080
Lola, Rocky,

38:02.240 --> 38:03.600
Lucky...

38:05.680 --> 38:07.240
No Sheep. End of story.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.920
They change the name
when they adopt them.

38:10.360 --> 38:12.040
If they don't like the name,
they change it.

38:12.200 --> 38:13.840
If you hadn't named it Sheep

38:14.440 --> 38:16.840
they might have kept its name
and we'd have one problem less.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.480
Two of them are females.

38:18.920 --> 38:20.320
Two less problems.

38:20.680 --> 38:21.640
There.

38:21.800 --> 38:22.680
Here.

38:23.680 --> 38:24.680
What are you doing?

38:24.840 --> 38:26.720
Calling the phone number for each dog.

38:26.880 --> 38:28.560
No, don't call them.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.480
We'll go and check

38:31.200 --> 38:32.280
and if he's there,

38:32.440 --> 38:34.200
-we'll figure it out.
-Figure it out?

38:34.360 --> 38:36.440
So we have to go to all three places
because you say so.

38:36.600 --> 38:38.200
We might get lucky the first time.

38:38.920 --> 38:40.000
Or the second.

38:40.160 --> 38:43.480
Okay, all set. That'll be 75.40, please.

38:43.640 --> 38:45.720
I'm going to pay.
Write down the addresses.

38:46.160 --> 38:48.760
Get some food, the fridge only has beer.

38:49.040 --> 38:50.240
No fucking way.

38:53.040 --> 38:54.320
No fucking way. My wallet.

38:57.040 --> 38:57.840
Damn it!

39:01.760 --> 39:03.120
At the dog shelter.

39:04.120 --> 39:05.760
It must have fallen out with my keys.

39:05.920 --> 39:07.800
-I told you to leave them.
-Shut up.

39:08.160 --> 39:09.320
Have you got money?

39:09.480 --> 39:10.640
Grandma had five euros.

39:10.800 --> 39:12.280
How far were you going to get with...?

39:12.720 --> 39:14.960
Look, really, we're aborting the mission.

39:15.120 --> 39:17.640
We'll go back, return the file, the dog,

39:17.800 --> 39:19.520
I'll apologize and get my wallet back.

39:19.680 --> 39:21.200
There aren't any cameras here.

39:21.360 --> 39:22.280
So?

39:22.440 --> 39:24.120
-We can just drive away.
-No.

39:24.280 --> 39:25.920
I'm going to explain the situation
to the guy.

39:26.120 --> 39:27.160
Leave the motor running.

39:27.320 --> 39:30.280
No. You never learn.
That's not how things are done.

39:52.240 --> 39:54.800
You lost your wallet right after
I filled your tank.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.160
Yeah, but actually it's not far from here.

39:57.320 --> 40:00.160
It's like 20 minutes away.
I'll come right back.

40:01.000 --> 40:01.720
Okay.

40:02.320 --> 40:04.440
-But leave something with me.
-Sure.

40:05.480 --> 40:06.440
The dog.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.520
No, no. We've had the dog our whole lives.

40:09.680 --> 40:10.520
Yeah, yeah.

40:11.160 --> 40:14.160
The dog, the kid
and the grandmother stay here.

40:14.640 --> 40:16.880
A lot of people abandon dogs here.

40:17.080 --> 40:19.600
Grandmothers and kids too, but less.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.880
-I'm going for my wallet.
-We can't go back there.

40:24.040 --> 40:25.480
They'll catch us.

40:25.640 --> 40:28.160
I'm only going to check.
You two stay here.

40:28.640 --> 40:30.240
Why is the motor running?

40:30.640 --> 40:32.000
Where did you get that knife?

40:32.600 --> 40:33.880
Let's leave before they realize.

40:34.240 --> 40:35.520
Before they realize what?

40:35.680 --> 40:37.880
The family from the bar. They're paying.

40:38.040 --> 40:39.200
What are you talking about?

40:44.120 --> 40:45.440
What's this? Did you steal it?

40:45.600 --> 40:47.160
I told you I was hungry.

40:47.480 --> 40:49.960
-You'll eat the sleeping bags?
-No.

40:54.400 --> 40:57.160
Come back here, you bastard!

40:59.000 --> 41:00.640
You didn't steal it, I did.

41:01.080 --> 41:02.080
Got it?

41:02.480 --> 41:03.720
And give me a croquette.

41:12.960 --> 41:14.840
Have you thought about what you'll do?

41:15.040 --> 41:17.200
-What do you mean?
-If everything works out.

41:17.360 --> 41:20.160
Imagine we get there,
tell them what happened,

41:20.680 --> 41:23.960
they soften up for some reason
and say yes.

41:24.120 --> 41:26.000
They'll take the three-legged dog

41:26.160 --> 41:27.520
and you get yours. What will you do?

41:27.680 --> 41:30.680
Because you're going back
to the center either way.

41:30.840 --> 41:33.280
What about the dog?
Who keeps the dog?

41:33.880 --> 41:35.880
I don't know, I'll see when it happens.

41:36.040 --> 41:37.960
I'm telling you right now,
I'm not keeping the dog.

41:38.120 --> 41:39.440
-Don't pester me.
-Don't pester you?

41:39.600 --> 41:40.680
You're the one pestering me.

41:40.840 --> 41:43.720
The shit I've taken every time
you say "Don't pester me."

42:06.120 --> 42:08.160
-Leave the motor running.
-Not again.

42:08.560 --> 42:09.680
No.

42:12.800 --> 42:14.440
Grandma, don't die until I come back.

42:29.160 --> 42:30.680
Stop, where are you going?

42:31.800 --> 42:33.760
-To knock on the door.
-No, don't knock.

42:33.920 --> 42:35.400
They could be waiting for us.

42:35.560 --> 42:36.920
Yeah, the FBI is waiting for us.

42:37.120 --> 42:39.600
-You want me to get caught.
-Yes, I do. I'd love that.

42:39.760 --> 42:41.960
I'd love for someone
to put an end to this shit.

42:42.120 --> 42:43.440
I can't trust you.

42:45.080 --> 42:46.320
Then what do you want to do?

42:46.480 --> 42:48.400
Look over the wall to see
if Sheep is there.

42:48.560 --> 42:50.880
If he's not, we'll leave
without attracting attention.

42:50.960 --> 42:53.400
Right, we've barely attracted
attention so far.

42:53.560 --> 42:55.960
-Yes, we have.
-I was being ironic.

43:04.840 --> 43:06.360
Come on, help me climb up.

43:06.520 --> 43:07.920
You can climb a 12 foot fence

43:08.120 --> 43:09.960
-but for this shitty wall you need help.
-Yes.

43:10.680 --> 43:11.560
Come on.

43:16.240 --> 43:18.480
I'm used to you stepping
on me anyway.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.160
Damn.

43:26.280 --> 43:27.640
Why are you wearing flip-flops?

43:27.800 --> 43:28.880
They took my sneakers away.

43:29.080 --> 43:31.280
-Why?
-So I wouldn't run away.

43:31.440 --> 43:33.120
Very effective measure.

43:36.360 --> 43:38.000
Is that your dog?

43:40.720 --> 43:42.720
-Héctor, is that your dog or not?
-Wait.

43:43.880 --> 43:45.840
Héctor, it's not a difficult question.

43:47.080 --> 43:49.240
No, it's not. Let's go.

43:51.400 --> 43:53.600
That's enough for today.

44:12.560 --> 44:13.880
-Did you put Grandma to bed?
-Yes.

44:14.400 --> 44:16.080
-Gave her the sedative?
-Yes.

44:16.240 --> 44:18.800
-Checked her oximeter?
-73%.

44:21.400 --> 44:23.280
What are you doing with my belt?

44:23.440 --> 44:24.600
Making a collar for the dog.

44:28.680 --> 44:31.360
-Thanks for asking me first.
-You're welcome.

44:33.080 --> 44:34.440
It was irony...

44:36.040 --> 44:37.360
You want a beer?

44:37.520 --> 44:38.720
No, sorry.

44:38.880 --> 44:41.880
You're about to turn 18,
we don't want to ruin

44:42.040 --> 44:43.880
your immaculate record.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.400
That was irony too.

44:51.240 --> 44:52.560
I don't like alcohol.

44:54.160 --> 44:55.000
Why not?

44:55.160 --> 44:57.600
-I don't like losing control.
-Oh, right.

44:57.760 --> 44:59.600
You're totally in fucking control.

45:00.800 --> 45:02.160
Just curious,

45:02.320 --> 45:03.720
how long would I get

45:03.880 --> 45:05.760
for all the crimes
I've committed now?

45:05.920 --> 45:08.400
If they catch me here dining al fresco,

45:08.560 --> 45:10.800
how long would I get?
Please, enlighten me.

45:12.480 --> 45:15.080
When you stole the file
did you use force or intimidation?

45:16.000 --> 45:17.160
Only with myself.

45:21.320 --> 45:22.280
No, Héctor.

45:23.720 --> 45:28.560
Medicine theft, document theft,
dog theft, theft from a vehicle,

45:28.720 --> 45:31.720
fraud at the gas station,
motorcycle theft...

45:31.880 --> 45:33.520
-All of that...
-Motorcycle theft?

45:33.680 --> 45:35.360
How do you think I got to Grandma’s?

45:36.040 --> 45:38.600
Continued and premeditated theft punished

45:38.760 --> 45:41.520
by Articles 234 and 244

45:41.680 --> 45:44.240
of the Criminal Code
in relation to Article 74.

45:44.400 --> 45:47.880
And minor infraction of fraud
punished by Article 248

45:48.040 --> 45:50.000
and the second paragraph of 249.

45:50.160 --> 45:51.120
<i>Olé.</i>

45:51.280 --> 45:52.880
-Any previous crimes?
-Yes.

45:53.560 --> 45:54.560
You.

45:57.520 --> 45:59.160
No record, darling.

46:01.440 --> 46:04.200
Without a previous record,
we'd be talking about

46:04.360 --> 46:08.000
a sentence of 12 to 18 months
for the continued infraction

46:08.160 --> 46:11.440
and a fine of 1 to 3 months
for the minor fraud charge.

46:11.600 --> 46:12.840
So you wouldn't go to jail.

46:14.640 --> 46:15.800
Great.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.040
Great. I'll sleep much better now.

46:22.520 --> 46:24.480
-You're not going to name this one?
-No.

46:24.640 --> 46:26.040
His owner will.

46:29.560 --> 46:30.840
Why are you being such a bitch

46:31.000 --> 46:32.440
about the dog?

46:35.320 --> 46:36.360
I know.

46:36.520 --> 46:37.640
Do you want to know?

46:38.200 --> 46:39.240
No.

46:42.520 --> 46:44.400
When you were little and had a tantrum

46:44.560 --> 46:47.120
and got nervous,
which was all the fucking time,

46:48.320 --> 46:50.720
what was the only thing
that calmed you down?

46:50.880 --> 46:52.680
Me. Well, not me.

46:52.840 --> 46:54.560
Me pretending I was a dog.

46:54.720 --> 46:56.120
Your dog.

46:56.920 --> 46:58.480
You'd crack up and it would pass.

46:58.640 --> 46:59.840
You don't remember?

47:00.280 --> 47:01.760
-No.
-Right.

47:01.920 --> 47:03.040
Rhino.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.400
I was Rhino the dog.

47:05.560 --> 47:08.240
Because you used to say "rhino"
instead of "right now."

47:08.400 --> 47:10.320
Where are we going "rhino?"

47:10.680 --> 47:12.920
I want to watch TV "rhino."

47:13.360 --> 47:15.080
"Rhino"

47:15.240 --> 47:17.360
I'm not hungry. "Rhino" we're not friends.

47:17.520 --> 47:19.880
"Rhino" I'm crying, "rhino" I'm shouting,
"rhino" I'm punching.

47:20.080 --> 47:21.800
Okay, okay, drop it already.

47:21.960 --> 47:23.480
Then I'd get on all fours

47:23.920 --> 47:27.000
and say: "Hi, I'm Rhino the dog."

47:27.560 --> 47:29.720
And I'd bark and growl at you

47:30.920 --> 47:33.360
and stick out my tongue and
give you my paw and howl at you.

47:33.520 --> 47:36.400
And you'd cover your ears
and tell me to leave you alone

47:36.560 --> 47:39.400
and I paid no fucking attention
and moaned at you

47:39.800 --> 47:41.360
and climbed into bed with you.

47:41.760 --> 47:43.440
And slowly your face would change.

47:43.600 --> 47:46.120
And your fear would go away.
Or anger, whatever it was.

47:46.640 --> 47:47.680
It cleansed you.

47:51.640 --> 47:53.840
Now tell me again that you don't remember.

47:54.320 --> 47:56.720
-It rings a bell.
-Jesus, what nerve.

47:57.480 --> 47:58.880
The good old days.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.520
When we were brothers.

48:55.200 --> 48:56.400
That dog is a fucking pain.

48:56.560 --> 48:58.400
-He likes you now.
-He can't.

48:58.560 --> 49:00.600
-Let him climb up.
-No.

49:00.760 --> 49:02.440
Dogs sleep on the floor.

49:02.600 --> 49:04.080
You'd rather not sleep all night?

49:04.240 --> 49:05.760
He'll get tired of whining.

49:05.920 --> 49:08.160
You haven't in 17 years.
So let him up, he won't stop.

49:30.720 --> 49:32.200
Grandma, don't die tonight.

49:33.360 --> 49:34.400
"Tarapara."

49:57.480 --> 49:59.240
Good morning, Grandma.

50:30.120 --> 50:31.720
Lift your tongue, Grandma.

51:11.160 --> 51:12.880
"Tarapara."

51:19.680 --> 51:21.000
You haven't talked to Marta

51:21.160 --> 51:23.960
this whole time.
Or sent her messages. Did she dump you?

51:24.120 --> 51:25.640
What are you saying?

51:25.800 --> 51:26.920
-Call her.
-No.

51:27.080 --> 51:28.720
I'll call her when I fucking want to.

51:29.120 --> 51:32.280
She dumped you.
What did you do? Why did you let her?

51:32.440 --> 51:35.560
You're such a pain.
You're worse than a hangover, kid.

51:35.720 --> 51:38.160
-I can tell you're not well.
-How can you tell?

51:38.320 --> 51:40.800
Since when do you care if I'm well or not?

51:41.000 --> 51:42.400
I don't care, but I can tell.

51:42.560 --> 51:43.880
When you're not well you do that.

51:44.080 --> 51:46.120
-Do what?
-This.

51:47.360 --> 51:49.560
Okay, look, I stopped. I'm fine now.

51:49.720 --> 51:51.360
Mind your own damn business.

51:51.680 --> 51:52.880
Okay, I will.

51:53.040 --> 51:54.560
Good, stay out of it.

52:11.200 --> 52:12.520
Look, your dog might be there.

52:12.880 --> 52:13.960
Whistle and see.

52:16.520 --> 52:18.440
It's not like that.

52:20.440 --> 52:22.120
-Hello.
-What's up?

52:36.360 --> 52:38.080
Don't say to leave the motor running.

52:38.720 --> 52:40.080
Okay, I won't say it.

52:40.680 --> 52:43.240
Now we're going to do what
we should have done all along.

52:43.880 --> 52:45.920
Tell the truth. Got it?

52:46.440 --> 52:48.480
-Got it.
-Yes or no? Look at me.

52:49.080 --> 52:50.520
I got it.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
You, come with me.

53:03.400 --> 53:04.760
Hello.

53:04.920 --> 53:06.000
Excuse me.

53:07.760 --> 53:10.040
Did you by any chance
adopt a dog recently?

53:10.200 --> 53:12.120
-By the name Rocky?
-Yes.

53:12.280 --> 53:13.640
-So?
-Well, you see...

53:13.800 --> 53:17.080
My brother's in a juvenile center...

53:17.240 --> 53:21.000
He's on leave.
And he's been doing therapy with dogs.

53:21.160 --> 53:23.880
And it turns out your dog might be

53:24.080 --> 53:27.520
the dog my brother
was working with and got

53:27.680 --> 53:29.840
very close to. And look at him,

53:30.000 --> 53:32.400
he's in bad shape.
Because it's the only living thing

53:32.560 --> 53:33.840
he's ever showed interest in,

53:34.000 --> 53:35.440
besides our grandmother.

53:35.760 --> 53:36.760
And what do you want?

53:37.520 --> 53:39.880
To see if it's the same dog. And if it is,

53:40.080 --> 53:42.640
to exchange it for this dog,

53:42.800 --> 53:45.360
which only has three legs
but always lies down,

53:45.520 --> 53:49.040
is very loyal and good company.

53:50.040 --> 53:52.200
Look, we don't know what we want.

53:53.560 --> 53:57.680
Or why we made this trip or what
we're doing here. That's the truth.

54:02.280 --> 54:04.160
Okay, come with me.

54:05.200 --> 54:06.280
Thank you.

54:06.720 --> 54:07.840
Come on, you.

54:08.000 --> 54:11.600
I found it inside a car
that just came in. Totaled.

54:11.760 --> 54:14.320
It was scared and malnourished.
I called the dog shelter

54:14.480 --> 54:16.680
and they told me the car
belonged to its owner,

54:16.840 --> 54:18.800
who had died in the car accident.

54:19.720 --> 54:22.240
Nobody knew how it got this far.

54:22.600 --> 54:25.840
They took the dog away
and after a few months,

54:26.040 --> 54:29.200
when I was wrecking the car,
I remembered the dog.

54:29.720 --> 54:31.160
I called the dog shelter

54:31.560 --> 54:34.520
and they said it was still there
awaiting adoption.

54:34.680 --> 54:36.320
So I went over

54:37.040 --> 54:38.320
and brought it home.

54:38.640 --> 54:41.440
It's been in its owner's car
ever since and won't come out.

54:44.080 --> 54:45.440
There it is.

54:55.880 --> 54:57.080
Is it him or not?

54:58.080 --> 54:59.080
No.

54:59.400 --> 55:00.720
Okay, then, let's go.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.160
Héctor.

55:03.480 --> 55:04.640
What are you doing?

55:08.720 --> 55:12.400
It has long nails,
scaly skin and peeled ears.

55:12.560 --> 55:13.840
Definitely leishmaniasis.

55:14.120 --> 55:16.600
You need to take it to the vet for tests.

55:16.680 --> 55:19.800
It'll need treatment
for the rest of its life.

55:20.680 --> 55:22.960
I can't afford something like that...

55:26.880 --> 55:28.080
That's my wallet!

55:28.600 --> 55:30.080
It'll die otherwise.

55:30.240 --> 55:31.440
No, Héctor. Put that away.

55:31.920 --> 55:33.040
-Here.
-Héctor.

55:33.480 --> 55:35.640
No, that's mine. Héctor.

55:36.440 --> 55:39.400
-Why did you take my wallet?
-I didn't take it.

55:39.560 --> 55:41.800
-You didn't?
-No, I picked it up.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.760
Oh, you picked it up.
And why didn't you give it back?

55:44.920 --> 55:46.200
In case something came up.

55:46.360 --> 55:49.520
-Something like what?
-Like this.

55:49.680 --> 55:51.200
You're definitely something.

55:52.160 --> 55:55.360
One more day and I won't have
to put up with this shit anymore.

55:55.520 --> 55:59.360
Three dogs
and we fucking miss on the first two.

55:59.520 --> 56:01.320
These things only happen to me.

56:01.600 --> 56:03.720
Actually they only happen to you.

56:04.160 --> 56:06.720
At least we can't miss now.

56:10.320 --> 56:11.520
What is that?

56:16.920 --> 56:18.240
Shit.

56:21.440 --> 56:22.720
We're going to the village.

57:16.520 --> 57:17.560
Father.

57:18.080 --> 57:21.120
You might not remember me,
I'm Chiri and Cuca's grandson.

57:21.720 --> 57:22.680
Hey...

57:23.920 --> 57:25.440
That's right.

57:26.480 --> 57:27.640
How are you, son?

57:28.240 --> 57:29.160
Well...

57:29.640 --> 57:33.120
Through these holy last rites
and His bountiful mercy,

57:33.280 --> 57:35.840
may the Lord help you
with the grace of the Holy Spirit

57:36.040 --> 57:38.640
so that, free of sin,
He may grant you salvation

57:38.800 --> 57:41.080
and comfort you in sickness. Amen.

57:46.120 --> 57:47.800
Where will you bury her?

57:48.480 --> 57:49.440
Here,

57:49.800 --> 57:51.160
with Grandpa Chiri.

57:51.560 --> 57:52.720
That's why we came.

57:57.800 --> 57:58.680
What's wrong?

58:06.480 --> 58:07.720
Where is Grandpa?

58:08.400 --> 58:10.360
The lease contract expired.

58:10.720 --> 58:12.200
What do you mean, expired?

58:12.360 --> 58:14.880
The funeral right lasts 75 years.

58:15.080 --> 58:16.840
It expired about a year ago.

58:17.320 --> 58:18.880
You didn't receive notice?

58:19.480 --> 58:21.840
My grandmother's been
in a home for 5 years.

58:22.360 --> 58:24.160
What happens if it isn't renewed?

58:24.320 --> 58:25.560
It becomes available.

58:26.480 --> 58:27.400
Okay.

58:28.880 --> 58:30.280
How much does it cost to renew?

58:30.440 --> 58:33.800
5,581 euros. 75 years, the maximum.

58:33.960 --> 58:36.280
-Please, that's a huge amount.
-We get the money and pay.

58:36.440 --> 58:38.920
-We have to bury her here.
-I want to too, smart ass.

58:39.080 --> 58:40.960
It's your fault we didn't receive

58:41.120 --> 58:42.200
the notice.

58:42.360 --> 58:44.680
-My fault?
-Yes, your fault.

58:44.840 --> 58:46.960
You put her in a home
and we moved out. Your fault.

58:47.120 --> 58:49.160
You are so fucking clueless. Sorry.

58:49.320 --> 58:52.840
You think I could have paid for this?

58:53.040 --> 58:54.440
Fucking Mr. My Way!

58:54.600 --> 58:55.400
We sell the camper.

58:55.560 --> 58:56.880
It's already for sale, it's not easy.

58:57.040 --> 58:57.760
It won't sell itself.

58:57.840 --> 59:00.520
I'm sure you've had offers,
but you have nowhere else to live.

59:00.680 --> 59:03.080
Don't bust my balls, this is new.

59:03.560 --> 59:06.480
It's unexpected.
Besides, I'm selling the camper

59:07.200 --> 59:09.480
-for a good reason.
-This is a good reason.

59:09.640 --> 59:12.000
-Look.
-Calm down, boys, don't argue.

59:12.720 --> 59:15.200
Even if you wanted to renew it,
you can't anymore.

59:15.360 --> 59:17.320
-Why?
-Because it's been leased already.

59:17.480 --> 59:18.280
By who?

59:19.240 --> 59:20.760
Your cousin Ignacio.

59:24.880 --> 59:26.720
Then where is my grandfather?

59:28.520 --> 59:30.000
There, in the cinerary.

59:32.080 --> 59:33.200
The what?

59:40.560 --> 59:43.440
Nice corpus luteum...

59:43.600 --> 59:45.520
When are you taking Vicenta to Lausanne?

59:45.680 --> 59:46.520
The day after tomorrow.

59:46.680 --> 59:48.520
We'll take a look at her when we finish.

59:49.680 --> 59:51.320
This one is ovulating.

59:51.480 --> 59:55.360
Prepare the embryo,
I'll put her tail to sleep.

59:55.880 --> 01:00:00.200
If I hadn't leased it,
someone else would have.

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:01.480
It's a tiny cemetery.

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:04.080
Why didn't you call me first?

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:06.200
When was the last time you were here?

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:09.120
Go by Grandma's house and then talk to me.

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:11.920
She's dying.
She probably only has hours left.

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:15.600
And all she wanted was to be
buried here with Grandpa.

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:18.080
Sorry, cousin, that's impossible.

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:21.040
I already gave the plot
to my father-in-law Kalin.

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:22.320
What a shitty gift, cousin.

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:24.080
Hey, watch your mouth.

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:25.840
He has terminal cancer.

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:27.600
There are free niches.

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:30.720
Why don't you get one?
Grandma doesn't need to know.

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.640
But I do. And so does Héctor.

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:35.640
Would you have been able
to afford it anyway?

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:40.080
How could you take out Grandpa

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:43.320
and incinerate his remains
and put him in a common ashtray?

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:44.520
-Cinerary.
-I don't care.

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:47.040
You mixed him with other people
in a fucking ashtray.

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.240
Do you know what the PH is
in the land around here?

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.440
-What are you talking about?
-Under five.

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:53.400
It's acidic land. Very acidic.

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:55.040
What's that got to do with it?

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:57.320
I didn't take him out, cousin.

01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:00.720
He was already gone.
You know what I found in the ditch?

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:01.840
Nothing.

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.720
And I mean nothing. Okay, wait.

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:06.560
His watch was there. I kept it.

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:10.760
I tell you Grandma is dying
and we've brought her here

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:13.120
and you don't even ask
to see her or anything.

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:15.800
What do you want, cousin?

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:18.560
You want me to feel bad?

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.160
Well, no.

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:21.520
No.

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:23.280
Grandma left.

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:25.840
And you haven't been back in years.

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:28.040
I'm the only one in the family who stayed.

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:31.240
The cemetery is for the people
who live here.

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.480
Now, if you don't mind,
I have to get back to work.

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.160
I've taken enough heat.

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:49.120
Don't worry, Grandma.
We fixed everything.

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:52.840
He's lying, Grandma.
They stole your grave.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.160
Are you stupid or what?

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:55.600
She doesn't like us lying to her.

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.200
I now, damn it, but...

01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:58.800
Never mind.

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:03.240
I can't take this anymore,
my head can't...

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:05.200
Stop plotting bullshit because it's over.

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.200
The land is acidic, okay?

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:10.560
Grandpa wasn't there when
they dug him up, only his watch.

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.880
This fucking land
even eats dead people.

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:14.600
So let's just drop it.

01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:16.760
Sometimes you have to know how to lose.

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:20.000
To win something, anything, for once,

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:22.000
first we have to learn how to lose.

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.400
I already know how to lose.

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:25.320
You have no fucking idea, Héctor.

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:27.400
No fucking idea.

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:29.400
Losing is one thing, we lost

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:30.440
and we lost big.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.720
Learning how is another thing,

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.240
with pride, accepting defeat.

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.560
All we can do now is be with her and wait.

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:39.560
Got it? And don't say "Got it,"

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:41.360
I know you never get it.

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:42.680
Just nod.

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.360
Where are you going?

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:05.440
To take Grandma for a stroll.

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:07.160
What? She's dying.

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:09.880
-So she can say goodbye to her town.
-No.

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.520
You'll get in trouble, I know you.

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:14.160
Stay here, I don't trust you.

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:16.360
Then come with us.

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:32.600
Great idea

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:35.040
bringing her here so she can see
her destroyed house.

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:36.800
Is this your cherry on top?

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.680
How did Grandpa's story go?

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:48.520
The one you always asked
Grandma to tell you.

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:50.240
She told me a lot of his stories.

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:52.400
Yeah, but there was one about

01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:55.520
a cow that he lost...

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:56.640
-Elvira the cow.
-Yeah.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.760
He didn't lose her, she ran away.

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:00.320
Okay, how did the story go?

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:02.840
The cows used to graze on community land

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:04.880
and each breeder had a time of year.

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:08.800
If someone else's cow got mixed
with yours, you could "adopt" it

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.440
and ask for a ransom.

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:12.840
They called it "adoption". It was legal.

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.680
One time Elvira got away,

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:18.120
she was the cow with
the most milk, she was adopted

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:21.600
and our great grandfather had to pay
a can of oil, a sack of flour,

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:23.520
half a kilo of sugar
and half a dozen eggs.

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:26.320
And as punishment,
he made Grandpa Chiri

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:28.160
sleep in the barn with Elvira for a week,

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:31.040
surrounded by cow piss and crap
and he stunk.

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.160
And he wouldn't let him wash up
to go to school.

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:37.000
And after the punishment was over
he kept sleeping in the barn with Elvira

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:38.680
and nobody understood why

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:41.640
and Grandma said it was because
the kids at school beat him up,

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:44.080
but stopped going near him
because he stunk

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:45.720
and they left him alone.

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:50.480
So now we know who you take after.

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:52.160
And proud of it.

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:57.000
She used to tell us
another story about cows.

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:58.120
What was it?

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:01.240
I don't know. I only liked that one.

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:02.240
What are you doing?

01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:05.000
Where are you going?

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:07.800
-To the camper.
-It's that way.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.280
You're plotting something.

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:11.360
-No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are, I can smell it.

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:13.480
What is it? Tell me. Tell me.

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:15.640
I can hear your head buzzing from here.

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.680
The buzzing is because
I'm learning to lose.

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:40.760
Ignacio told me you were around.

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:44.280
-Sorry about your grandma.
-Thanks.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:45.960
And about your dad too.

01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:50.400
Because he's really...

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:53.920
Papuco.

01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:55.760
How long did they give you to live?

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:58.240
Three months, seven months ago.

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:03.400
Maybe we can bury them
together and everyone's happy.

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:06.480
Sorry.

01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:10.360
I'll serve him, sweetie.

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:16.920
Well?

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:21.240
-You up for a friendly game later?
-No, thanks.

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:24.800
-This one's on the house.
-No...

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:27.200
This I can afford.

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:01.040
Tell the Dutchman story.

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:02.360
No, it's stupid.

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:03.880
Stupid, he says.

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:06.560
A Dutchman writes him
the other day on Facebook...

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:07.640
Be quiet already.

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:10.200
-Everybody already knows.
-Not me.

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:16.880
Sorry, I don't know the story
about the Dutchman on Facebook.

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:18.520
It's a stupid story, cousin.

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:22.160
A Dutchman wrote me the other day
on Facebook to buy my cow

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:25.560
before the contest.
And I didn't answer him.

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:28.880
But he insisted and I said,
"Okay, 60,000 euros"

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:31.400
knowing I didn't want to sell her.

01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:32.480
And he goes and says yes.

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:33.920
And I said, "Damn."

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:36.120
"This guy has a heavy wallet."

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:39.400
I would sell her. Things have been bad
ever since they got rid

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:40.560
of the milk quotas.

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.360
Breeders are killing cows
to lower production.

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:43.800
No way.

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:47.360
The key is the offspring. Vicenta will
give good ones, no matter which bull.

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:48.760
You extract her embryo.

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:51.760
Or two, or three, or twenty.
And you sell those embryos

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:54.920
for money. How much did
you make today inseminating?

01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:56.320
I'll tell you tomorrow.

01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:12.600
What's up?

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:15.120
What are you doing?

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:16.160
You did remember.

01:08:16.319 --> 01:08:17.120
Remember what?

01:08:17.279 --> 01:08:20.439
The other story. About adopting cows.

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:22.200
You never forget anything.

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:26.000
Why didn't you tell me? Go on, tell me.

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:27.399
I don't follow.

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:31.520
About how the kids in town,
to pay for the local fair,

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:34.560
they'd steal cows from the farms

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:37.479
and adopt them saying
they were in their pasture.

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:39.200
Now tell me you don't remember.

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:41.760
-No.
-Yeah, well, you know what?

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:44.279
Our cousin has a cow that's like
the Messi of cows.

01:08:44.439 --> 01:08:47.080
-I don't like soccer.
-You will now.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.840
Look. She's a champion
at a million cow things

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.560
and he can sell her for
over 60,000 euros.

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:55.160
And her embryos.

01:08:55.319 --> 01:08:57.359
It’s a fucking awesome cow.
And next week

01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:00.920
it’s going to Lausanne
for a European championship

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:03.359
of some cow bullshit
they hold every three years.

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:04.560
The Champions League of cows.

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:06.359
I don't like soccer.

01:09:07.279 --> 01:09:08.560
We agreed not to do anything.

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:10.560
We stay with Grandma
and we learn how to lose.

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:15.040
Since when do you listen to what I say?

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:18.160
You've had 18 years to listen to me.

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:19.439
And you have to start now.

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:26.040
Listen to me.

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:29.040
This is an adoption story.
Your dog was adopted.

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:32.600
You adopted me. Cousin Ignacio
adopted our grave and now we...

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:35.000
-We're not stealing a cow.
-Exactly.

01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:37.439
We're not. Because I'm going to do it.

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:39.200
And it's not stealing.

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:41.000
It's adopting.

01:09:42.319 --> 01:09:43.840
Forced robbery

01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:46.319
aggravated by the value
of the item stolen.

01:09:46.479 --> 01:09:47.760
Two to five years.

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:49.800
With previous crimes, definitely jail.

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:52.160
I don’t give a shit.
Anything for Grandma, right?

01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:53.240
You're drunk.

01:09:53.399 --> 01:09:55.320
Well, a little, so what?
It makes me braver.

01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:57.280
No, it makes you stupid.

01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:00.920
You said a bad word. Very good.

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:04.400
We won't get Grandpa's grave back.
You'll get caught.

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:06.680
We'll see. And we'll see if our cousin

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:09.920
cares more about his cow
or his father-in-law.

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:13.080
How will you get it out of there?

01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:14.160
Where will you hide it?

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:17.160
Did you think about the consequences
before you ran away for your dog?

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:19.520
Then stay out of my head, I'm in control.

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:21.280
Why do you want Grandma's sedatives?

01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:23.560
-In case the cow gets feisty.
-No way.

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:26.640
You can't drug a cow. 337 is untouchable.

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:28.600
What's 337?

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:30.360
Mistreating an animal.

01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:33.000
I don't want you to go, Isma.

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:35.520
Don't go.

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:38.840
Listen to one thing, Héctor.

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:40.840
That gesture you had.

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:45.120
Knowing the story about the kids,
because you knew it by heart,

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:50.640
but not using that information
to get in trouble.

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:55.240
That proves

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:58.600
that you've learned how
to control your tantrums.

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:01.760
That means officially today

01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:04.520
you've learned how to lose.

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:08.040
Congratulations.

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:14.640
Don't die until I get back, Grandma.

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:33.000
Holy cow!

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:40.240
They're all the same. Which one is it?

01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:52.800
Fucking cell phone...

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.640
STOP SENDING ME VOICE MESSAGES
I WON'T LISTEN TO THEM, IT'S OVER

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:17.280
<i>Hi, I saw you're on-line</i>

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:21.040
<i>and I'm in my grandma's home town,</i>
<i>she's in pretty bad shape.</i>

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:24.280
<i>She might die today</i>
<i>or tomorrow, we don't know.</i>

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:29.320
<i>I thought of you because</i>
<i>you two always hit it off so well.</i>

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:37.320
<i>I don't know why I'm sending you this</i>
<i>if you haven't listened to the rest.</i>

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:49.480
The land isn't acidic.

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:52.880
Scared the shit out of me.

01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:55.720
Mix the dirt with water
and sodium bicarbonate.

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:58.080
-No reaction, not acidic.
-What?

01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:59.480
I learned it at the center.

01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:01.240
And you still complain...

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:04.280
Change toxic thought
for pro-social thought.

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:07.080
That's why I didn't tell you
the story about the kids.

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:08.320
I knew it.

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:09.720
But our cousin lied to us.

01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:11.800
-What?
-When they dug up Grandpa,

01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:14.680
besides the watch,
there had to be teeth and bones.

01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:16.800
That son of a bitch.

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:18.840
-Let's get out of here.
-No.

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:20.680
Not without the cow.

01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:22.440
-The cow isn't here.
-What do you mean?

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:24.520
-Of course it is.
-No. Cows are put

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:26.600
in quarantine before championships.

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:28.280
You learn that at the center too?

01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:30.520
No, I read it on the internet.

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.640
What are you doing with my cell phone?

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:34.440
Why do you know my password?

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:36.440
-Shut up.
-What?

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:39.760
-What?
-It's that way.

01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:05.680
Messi.

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:12.720
Shit, a lock. It's all yours.
Do your magic, Mr. My Way.

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:15.080
I thought you didn't want me
to commit a crime.

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:18.920
This isn't a crime. We're freeing the cow.
You think it wants to be here?

01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:22.560
Enjoy the music or your superpowers.
Just open it.

01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:24.120
Why are you living in the camper?

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:25.360
What?

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:26.560
Did Marta leave you?

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:28.920
Don't be a buzzkiller. Not now. Go on.

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:30.760
Tell me or I won't open it.

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:32.680
Héctor, don't fuck with me. Open it.

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:34.600
She dumped you.

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:37.280
It's up in the air.

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:39.800
Up in the air? Did she leave you or not?

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:41.000
Yeah, a little. Because...

01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:42.840
-We really have to do this here?
-Yes.

01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:44.000
-Now?
-Yes.

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:46.480
-I'll tell you later, damn it.
-No.

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:54.200
She's pregnant.

01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:56.320
And it was like no...

01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:57.920
But yes, she is.

01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:01.200
We were fucking careless.
I swear I didn't, neither did she...

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:02.920
But suddenly she says that

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:06.800
she wants to have it.
And I was like: "My love, what?"

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000
"How can we?"

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:10.360
And she says: "Yes."
And I said I can't.

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:12.440
And she said: "What do you mean?"
And I said:

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:14.760
"I can't."

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:19.840
"I don't want to."

01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:22.280
And that's it.

01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:25.240
Yeah, I have no heart. Open it.

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:34.720
That's it, drink and relax a little.

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:38.600
What are you doing?

01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:54.080
Of course, of course.

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.720
Let it all out.

01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:03.240
If you used your time wisely, good lord.

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:14.840
I don't want you to be like Dad.

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:18.360
Let's go.

01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:43.080
Hey, stop, stop.

01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:45.240
I can't believe it,
that's our cousin's car.

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:48.080
He couldn't already know. Or could he?

01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:51.320
Animals sometimes have a chip with a GPS.

01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:54.400
-Now you tell me?
-Yes.

01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:57.720
He can't see us with the cow.
We have to hide.

01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:00.160
-He won't leave until we go in.
-What do we do?

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:02.760
We've "adopted" the cow
to ask for a ransom.

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:04.440
That's what we'll do.

01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:12.680
What are you doing here?

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:19.040
What I should have done first,
come to say goodbye to Grandma.

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:25.520
Damn, Héctor, you're so much older.

01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:27.640
-So are you.
-Right.

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:31.320
-That's the only reason you came?
-No.

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:35.800
Also to apologize.
I was a jerk this morning.

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:37.560
And then Jesus

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:40.240
about the cow in the bar.

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:42.160
I'm very sorry, cousin. There.

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:43.800
Right.

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:46.840
Okay, look, cousin.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.480
We want Grandpa's grave.

01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:51.000
We want the grave.

01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:52.360
The grave.

01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:54.920
I'm ashamed to say it,
but that's impossible.

01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:58.160
Yes, it is possible.

01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:00.920
No, it isn't. I lied to you.

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:02.800
The land here

01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.360
isn't acidic.

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:09.000
There were remains,
of course there were.

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:10.920
But things were bad with Rosa.

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:15.200
She said I don't take care
of the girls, or her family,

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:16.840
that I'm always with the cows,

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:18.440
that I love Vicenta more than her.

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:21.520
I play music for Vicenta at night
and I don't even take her dancing.

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:23.480
Then her dad got cancer,

01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:27.240
and I did it without thinking
about the consequences.

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:30.960
I would love nothing more than
to give back the grave to Grandma

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:32.280
and Grandpa,

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:34.760
but if I do I'll ruin my life.

01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:40.360
I talked to the mayor
and there aren't any more graves.

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:44.720
But I reserved a niche
in the second row, the best row.

01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:47.720
The closest, the most expensive.

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:50.480
3,000 euros.

01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:53.240
I'll pay for it myself.

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:55.000
I know it's not the same.

01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:58.280
If you never want to talk to me again,
I'd understand.

01:18:58.440 --> 01:18:59.600
There's no reason...

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:03.480
to be so radical, cousin.

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:08.720
What's done is done.

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:10.840
I mean...

01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:13.840
Don't torture yourself. Look at me.

01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:16.680
Sometimes you do things

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:19.520
without thinking and you have
to be understanding.

01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:20.480
And learn how to lose.

01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:23.600
And learn how to lose.
Forget it, cousin.

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:27.160
Hey, look at me! The niche
in the second row is fantastic.

01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:28.000
Yeah.

01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:30.680
-We want the watch too.
-The watch too.

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:33.120
Of course, Héctor.
Of course you can have it.

01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:35.600
Take the fucking watch.
Why would I want it?

01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:37.120
Okay, cousin, that's it.

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:39.160
Cousin, cousin, cousin.

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:42.080
There. You can rest easy.
Thank you.

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:43.920
Cousin.

01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:46.160
Listen... cousin.

01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:50.920
Cousin. Listen to me.

01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:54.640
Remember when Grandpa Chiri's cow
got "adopted"?

01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:04.120
The sixth row isn't so bad.

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:06.760
More privacy.

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:08.520
They bother you less.

01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:11.200
Grandma, you can die peacefully now.

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:13.520
No, not yet.

01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:17.280
Seriously?

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:22.800
Now what, MacGyver?

01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:29.280
Don't do it, Héctor.

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:31.200
Come with me, Grandpa Chiri.

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:52.640
Grandma?

01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:55.040
-Already?
-No, she's better.

01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:57.240
Her oxygen level is up to 81%.

01:20:57.880 --> 01:20:59.160
After the huge mess we made,

01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:00.840
-now you're not dying anymore.
-"Tarapara."

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.360
"Tarapara" my ass.

01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:04.080
-It bothers you she's not dying?
-Yeah, right.

01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:05.600
It bothers me?

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:09.120
It just seems like you two
are conspiring to make my life hell.

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:11.080
-Come on, let's go.
-No.

01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:13.080
-We should wait.
-Wait for what?

01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:15.040
It's the typical improvement
before she dies.

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:16.640
-What?
-Yeah, you feel better

01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:18.840
because you're about to go
to a better place.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.720
You use up what little you have left.

01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:22.320
It's better to wait

01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:23.960
-for her to finish.
-We can't wait.

01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:26.040
We have to finish
what we came to do.

01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:27.720
Grandma isn't going to die.

01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:30.800
So choose: the center
or for your dog, Mr. My Way.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.000
You're nicer drunk.

01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:34.600
"Tarapara."

01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:00.040
Why are you so serious?

01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:03.280
I'm always serious.

01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:05.960
You? No way! What are you saying?

01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:08.200
You're the life of the party.

01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:11.760
No, seriously, Héctor.

01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:14.440
You need to learn the meaning of irony.

01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:16.680
Because the world is fucking ironic.

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:18.840
Want me to explain?

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:21.680
-Irony is saying nonsense.
-Okay.

01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:23.720
If you already know...

01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:26.800
Okay, explain it to me.

01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:29.400
Okay.

01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:32.840
Easy example, imagine
I go up to cousin Ignacio and say:

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:35.480
"Hey, cousin, that's great. "

01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:38.680
It's great you took Grandpa
out of his grave

01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:40.600
for a stroll in the woods."

01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:42.240
Why is that irony and not nonsense?

01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:45.320
Because it wasn't a stroll in the woods.

01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:48.160
And he understands
that my comment was bitter

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:51.480
and has another meaning, it isn't literal

01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:54.160
and I'm criticizing him.

01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:55.560
Do you get it?

01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:57.160
I don't know.

01:22:57.320 --> 01:22:59.800
Go on, make one up.
Make an ironic comment.

01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:04.440
First think of something
that pisses you off.

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:07.880
-You reported me to get rid of me.
-For Christ’s sake, not again.

01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:10.320
But okay, that works.

01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:13.320
Now say that you're totally happy
I reported you.

01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:15.040
-I'm not.
-I know.

01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:17.200
That's the point.
Say it like it's the best thing

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:18.640
that's ever happened to you.

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:22.440
Thanks a lot for reporting me
to get rid of me.

01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:24.560
No, like you're joking.

01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:29.040
"Hey, Isma, I am so glad

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:31.400
you sent me to that summer camp.
Thank you!"

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:33.000
It's not a summer camp.

01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:35.720
-That's the irony.
-And it's two years, not one summer.

01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:38.080
-I know, it's a joke.
-No, it isn't.

01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:39.160
It's hell.

01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:41.840
Okay, forget it. It's impossible.
You're right.

01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:43.520
Irony is saying nonsense.

01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:56.000
It must be one of those houses.

01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:00.080
-Pull over.
-What?

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:01.560
Don't start.

01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:03.800
-Pull over.
-I'm not pulling over, damn it.

01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:06.000
We're going to the front door.

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:07.840
He won't be there.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.320
-Why not?
-No.

01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:11.240
Sheep won't be there.

01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:14.800
Sure, he will.
It's the only place left to check.

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:18.720
He was at the first house we saw.

01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:23.880
At the first house we saw?

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.360
Héctor, quit fucking with me!

01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:29.760
He was at the first house?

01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:32.640
Why didn't you say anything?

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:36.520
Will you fucking talk to me

01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:38.480
and tell me what you're thinking?

01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:42.200
If you made up Grandma dying
I swear I'll kill you.

01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:44.040
No. Grandma's health is untouchable.

01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:47.600
Oh, but mine isn't.
You can fuck with mine.

01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:52.160
I'm sorry.

01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:01.760
Where...?

01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:25.080
Okay, Héctor.

01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:28.600
I'll go to jail for you
not telling me sooner,

01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:32.560
but it's okay.

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:34.680
But just so I understand:

01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:38.640
If we went through all this crap

01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:41.680
to find your dog,
why didn't you say anything?

01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:44.320
Was he with an old man

01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:46.480
in a wheelchair
or a terminally sick person?

01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:47.640
No.

01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:50.040
He was with a dog.

01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:52.200
With a dog?

01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:55.680
Yeah, with a dog. With other dogs.

01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:03.560
-Is that your dog?
-Wait.

01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:09.280
Héctor, is that your dog or not?

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.120
Héctor, it's not a difficult question.

01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:15.880
<i>He didn't like dogs.</i>

01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:20.000
<i>He was afraid of them.</i>
<i>He never went near them.</i>

01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:21.520
<i>And playing even less.</i>

01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:24.720
<i>He preferred to be alone all the time.</i>

01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:27.880
No, it isn't.

01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:33.560
I didn't want the trip to end.

01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:37.720
That's why I didn't say anything.

01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:05.120
Good night, Grandma.

01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:06.920
"Tarapara."

01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:12.320
Don't get your hopes up.

01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:36.240
WE'LL TALK WHEN YOU GET BACK

01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:42.480
What the fuck?

01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:49.000
<i>Stop sending me text messages.</i>
<i>I won't listen to them. It's over.</i>

01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:51.080
<i>I swear this is the last time</i>
<i>I'll write you.</i>

01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:53.520
<i>I only wanted to say</i>
<i>I got scared about the pregnancy.</i>

01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:56.280
<i>But not because I don't want it.</i>
<i>It's Héctor.</i>

01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:58.800
<i>I've been a father to him for 17 years</i>

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.400
<i>and I did a lousy job.</i>
<i>Look where he is.</i>

01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:03.840
<i>I swear I've tried</i>
<i>but I did everything wrong.</i>

01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:07.080
<i>Really bad.</i>
<i>That's why I didn't want it.</i>

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:10.000
<i>But I think I know better now.</i>
<i>I'm finally learning.</i>

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:12.640
<i>I've been doing pretty well</i>
<i>these last few days.</i>

01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:14.920
<i>Doing things for him</i>
<i>I'd never done before.</i>

01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:17.160
<i>For him. For me.</i>
<i>That's why I didn't want it.</i>

01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:19.680
<i>And Héctor's going to be 18</i>
<i>and he can fend for himself.</i>

01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:22.320
<i>I'll have more time for you and our son.</i>

01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:24.960
<i>Don't worry I won't be like my dad.</i>
<i>I'm selling the camper.</i>

01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:26.720
<i>So I'll have money for us.</i>
<i>And I'm writing a pretty song for him.</i>

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:28.760
<i>Now I can do it.</i>
<i>I want it. Can I come home?</i>

01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:44.960
How did you figure out my password?

01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:47.840
Using the year you were born is bullshit.

01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:50.440
That's true...

01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:52.840
Scoot over.

01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:08.760
Since when are you a marriage counselor?

01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:14.240
So you decided for me, huh? Doctor Love?

01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:18.360
There's no decision to make.

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:19.320
-There isn't?
-No.

01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:22.280
And I do care.

01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:24.400
About what?

01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:26.160
When you're not okay.

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:27.760
I care.

01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:36.600
Happy birthday.

01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:54.120
I thought you were giving me the camper.

01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:57.400
-That I earned it.
-Yeah, right.

01:29:58.200 --> 01:29:59.640
Don't freak out.

01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:01.600
Your sneakers are too big for me.

01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:03.800
Put some cotton inside.

01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:05.720
You don't have any cotton.

01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:07.440
Some toilet paper.

01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:12.480
No toilet paper either?

01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:22.280
-There's a hole.
-Damn, bro.

01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:24.240
Stop complaining.
You’re wearing flip-flops.

01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:28.040
-That's true.
-Sure.

01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:29.800
Thanks.

01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:34.480
Hallelujah, kid.

01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:57.120
ADOPTION FILES

01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:11.760
Her oxygen level dropped again.

01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:13.560
What does that mean?

01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:15.240
Three minutes ago it was fine.

01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:17.880
And now it's dropped because...

01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:21.000
-The three-legged dog cured her.
-The three-legged dog cured her.

01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:23.440
-Are you being serious?
-No.

01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:25.400
You cured her with your insults.

01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:28.200
You just made an ironic comment.

01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:30.000
And you something stupid.

01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:23.680
Don't die until I get out, okay, Grandma?

01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:25.880
"Tarapara."

01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:28.240
And you, take care of her.

01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:29.800
"Taraparo."

01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:31.640
"Taraparo?"

01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:33.560
"Taraparo."

01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:49.600
It's just another month and a half.

01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:56.720
No running away or getting in trouble.

01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:58.840
When you're 18, Héctor,

01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:00.960
it has to stop.

01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:05.720
You said you didn't want this to end.

01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:07.160
For it not to end,

01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:10.400
you have to go back in.

01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:12.320
Otherwise it's impossible.

01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:13.480
What is?

01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:17.560
Us being brothers again.

01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:23.040
Imagine in a month and a half

01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:26.280
all the dog books you'll be
able to read and memorize.

01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:30.000
You'll come out a veterinarian.

01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:33.360
The problem
isn't the month and a half inside.

01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:35.080
Then what?

01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:37.240
After...

01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:39.120
After what?

01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:41.600
You won't be there.

01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:43.400
When I get out, you won't be there.

01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:47.080
Yeah, yeah.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.560
You're right, yeah.

01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:52.280
I won't be there.

01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:54.800
But anyway...

01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:56.320
your dog will be.

01:34:57.800 --> 01:34:59.440
Taraparo isn't my dog.

01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:01.440
I don't mean Taraparo.

01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:03.600
And Sheep is fine where he is.

01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:06.120
I don't mean Sheep either.

01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:28.400
Hello, Héctor.

01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:51.840
Okay.

01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:56.400
Goodbye, Isma.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.160
See you later.
