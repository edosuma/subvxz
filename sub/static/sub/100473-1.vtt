WEBVTT

01:11.698 --> 01:12.699
It's time to go.

01:13.465 --> 01:14.466
Okay.

01:20.006 --> 01:21.908
Jude. Let's go, baby.

01:24.309 --> 01:25.310
Shh.

01:26.746 --> 01:27.747
Come on.

01:36.856 --> 01:37.857
Hurry.

02:23.102 --> 02:25.805
Mr. Hamilton, we're doing
everything that we can.

02:26.639 --> 02:28.440
I haven't always been good
to her.

02:30.643 --> 02:32.009
She doesn't deserve this.

02:32.011 --> 02:34.011
Don't think about that now.

02:34.013 --> 02:35.681
Just, you know,
forgive yourself

02:36.783 --> 02:38.517
and be nice to her.

02:39.118 --> 02:40.485
Hey. Are you married?

02:40.920 --> 02:41.852
- No.
- Okay.

02:41.854 --> 02:44.420
Because I was thinking,
my friend, Hank,

02:44.422 --> 02:46.657
he has a small farm
in Nebraska.

02:46.659 --> 02:48.893
And he could really use
a hand.

02:48.895 --> 02:51.461
I don't think that house
has been cleaned

02:51.463 --> 02:53.764
since we were listening
to The Bee Gees.

02:53.766 --> 02:56.934
Hank's not for everybody,
but I think you'd like him.

02:56.936 --> 02:58.938
That's very kind of you, um,

03:00.505 --> 03:03.741
but I couldn't leave my job
or my other job.

03:03.743 --> 03:05.575
- Alice.
- Thank you, though. Thank you.

03:05.577 --> 03:07.312
We need you in there,
not out here.

03:08.613 --> 03:09.880
Bye.

03:09.882 --> 03:10.883
Come on, Alice.

03:21.560 --> 03:22.762
It's really all I can do
for you.

03:24.964 --> 03:26.997
I don't mean to be rude but

03:26.999 --> 03:29.099
firing me is all you can do
for me?

03:29.101 --> 03:30.734
That's the conclusion
I've reached, Jeff.

03:30.736 --> 03:32.036
But I haven't done anything.

03:32.038 --> 03:33.704
That's exactly my point.

03:33.706 --> 03:35.373
We're trying to sell
some mattresses here,

03:35.942 --> 03:37.741
put some people to sleep.

03:37.743 --> 03:40.077
I don't see
your contribution.

03:40.079 --> 03:42.112
I just need a little more time
to get the hang of it.

03:42.114 --> 03:45.182
There are many of us who doubt
that would make any difference.

03:45.184 --> 03:47.117
Actually,
I think we're all agreed that

03:47.119 --> 03:49.720
you're pretty bad
at just about everything.

03:49.722 --> 03:52.589
That... That's not,
that's not true.

03:52.591 --> 03:54.359
Name just one thing
you are good at.

04:11.610 --> 04:12.678
I'm sorry.

04:20.786 --> 04:22.054
This is so cool.

04:22.922 --> 04:24.454
We should keep this.

04:24.456 --> 04:27.691
What if we get a new house?
I want you to have it.

04:27.693 --> 04:29.525
That is very nice of you,

04:29.527 --> 04:31.662
but we don't need it.
We're on vacation.

04:31.664 --> 04:32.997
It's great, though.

04:32.999 --> 04:34.397
We got crazy lucky.

04:34.399 --> 04:38.769
It probably fell off a truck or
something, right into our lives.

04:38.771 --> 04:42.605
Well, I don't think that it's
gonna fit right into our trunk.

04:42.607 --> 04:44.644
Besides I have to confirm
where we're staying.

04:45.912 --> 04:47.912
We just give it
to someone else then.

04:47.914 --> 04:50.848
Everybody likes a good chair.

04:50.850 --> 04:54.086
That's why we're gonna leave it
here for someone else to find.

04:54.921 --> 04:56.754
Where are we now?

04:56.756 --> 04:58.956
Some place
you've wanted to go

04:58.958 --> 05:02.059
for a long, long, long time.

05:02.061 --> 05:03.493
The mall?

05:03.495 --> 05:04.496
Better!

05:05.530 --> 05:07.597
- Look.
- Not New York.

05:07.599 --> 05:09.567
Yes! That is Manhattan.

05:10.903 --> 05:14.171
But Dad says
we don't like New York.

05:14.173 --> 05:16.776
I've never been to Manhattan,
so, I really wouldn't know.

05:17.843 --> 05:19.276
What about school?

05:19.278 --> 05:21.681
New York is going to be
a kind of school for you.

05:46.906 --> 05:47.907
So...

05:48.941 --> 05:50.007
I'm tired.

05:54.647 --> 05:55.681
More pancakes?

05:56.649 --> 05:57.982
You've only had 11.

05:57.984 --> 06:00.217
- I gotta go to the office.
- Now?

06:00.219 --> 06:02.520
Yeah. I'm in court
at 8 a.m. tomorrow.

06:03.923 --> 06:06.991
- So, I will see you on Tuesday?
- Tuesday?

06:06.993 --> 06:09.592
- My group. You said you'd go.
- Did I?

06:09.594 --> 06:11.161
I'll be honest.
It's very helpful.

06:11.163 --> 06:12.629
Helps me get through
all those times

06:12.631 --> 06:15.632
I have to defend someone
I know is guilty.

06:15.634 --> 06:17.001
And they're found
not guilty.

06:17.003 --> 06:18.102
Yes.

06:18.104 --> 06:19.636
So, you forgive them?

06:19.638 --> 06:22.072
I forgive myself.
What's the damage?

06:22.074 --> 06:24.041
- I'll get that.
- Are you sure?

06:24.043 --> 06:26.810
Yeah. I invited you
to celebrate.

06:26.812 --> 06:27.813
This is true.

06:31.083 --> 06:32.783
All right, goodnight.

06:32.785 --> 06:34.586
Congrats on your first day
as a free man.

06:44.897 --> 06:46.799
Putin gets up
at seven or eight.

06:47.800 --> 06:48.766
That's right.

06:48.768 --> 06:51.935
The time difference
between Moskva and...

06:51.937 --> 06:55.305
Excuse me. I just need
to pay my check.

06:55.307 --> 06:58.375
Have another drink.
Did your friend leave?

06:58.377 --> 07:01.378
- My lawyer.
- Those guys get up so early.

07:01.380 --> 07:05.649
I've heard that Putin
sometimes gets up at 4:30 a.m.

07:05.651 --> 07:07.051
This is your place?

07:07.053 --> 07:10.289
We are only the advisors.
Timofey is the owner.

07:11.357 --> 07:12.923
The service is terrible.

07:12.925 --> 07:14.191
Not as bad as the food.

07:14.193 --> 07:15.692
What can I tell you?

07:15.694 --> 07:17.161
Did you try the celery thing?

07:17.163 --> 07:19.630
- Nah.
- It's disgusting.

07:19.632 --> 07:21.365
You don't by any chance
for some reason

07:21.367 --> 07:23.300
play the double bass
balalaika, do you?

07:23.302 --> 07:25.736
Do I look like someone
who plays bass balalaika?

07:25.738 --> 07:27.171
Don't worry.
It's absolutely all right.

07:27.173 --> 07:29.206
- Everyone can learn.
- He said no, Timofey!

07:29.208 --> 07:30.876
It doesn't hurt to ask.

07:33.379 --> 07:34.812
He ask everyone.

07:34.814 --> 07:35.915
Please.

07:44.023 --> 07:45.956
We have a lot on the plate
at the moment,

07:45.958 --> 07:49.359
but we care very much
for this house.

07:49.361 --> 07:53.730
Timofey, he inherited
everything from his grandfather

07:53.732 --> 07:56.166
who came here
right before the revolution.

07:56.168 --> 07:59.670
He did not leave Russia
for political reasons.

07:59.672 --> 08:02.673
On the contrary,
he always remained loyal

08:02.675 --> 08:05.177
to whichever regime
was in the Kremlin.

08:06.378 --> 08:07.978
But, Timofey,

08:07.980 --> 08:09.913
your heart isn't in it.

08:09.915 --> 08:12.952
Please, Sergei.
We've had this conversation.

08:14.720 --> 08:17.054
Many New Yorkers
feel uncomfortable

08:17.056 --> 08:18.958
sitting
in these surroundings.

08:20.092 --> 08:21.425
Just as an example,

08:21.427 --> 08:25.030
we don't know how
to make that celery dish work.

08:25.998 --> 08:27.633
I know
how to run a restaurant.

08:28.400 --> 08:29.635
Interesting.

08:31.337 --> 08:32.338
- Hmm?
- Hmm.

08:56.362 --> 08:57.363
Hi.

08:58.497 --> 09:00.264
Oh, hi.

09:00.266 --> 09:01.765
Can I come in?

09:01.767 --> 09:04.770
Uh, eh... Yeah, sure.

09:05.437 --> 09:06.705
Thanks.

09:13.078 --> 09:15.245
So, you're in the city, huh?

09:15.247 --> 09:17.247
Yeah. Just drove down
from Buffalo.

09:17.249 --> 09:18.949
Richard is looking for you.

09:18.951 --> 09:21.687
Um, could you just not
tell him that I'm here?

09:23.155 --> 09:24.790
Why would I lie to him?
He's my son.

09:25.991 --> 09:28.258
Those boys of yours
are my grandsons.

09:28.260 --> 09:29.426
You hardly even know them.

09:29.428 --> 09:30.462
Well, they're never here.

09:32.031 --> 09:33.265
Richard wouldn't let us come.

09:34.200 --> 09:35.367
Are they here now?

09:39.205 --> 09:40.304
I'll see you.

09:40.306 --> 09:43.042
Next time you come,
you scrub up first. Will you?

09:43.809 --> 09:44.810
No.

09:49.782 --> 09:51.215
Want a donut, dear?

09:51.217 --> 09:53.350
We need a place to stay.

09:53.352 --> 09:55.452
Just for a couple of days.
Just me and the boys.

09:55.454 --> 09:57.888
I promise they won't be
any trouble.

09:57.890 --> 10:00.123
You had a fight,
you took the car.

10:00.125 --> 10:01.225
It's my car.

10:01.227 --> 10:02.526
Where are you going?

10:02.528 --> 10:05.395
Just sightseeing, really.

10:05.397 --> 10:07.965
Me and the boys
have never been anywhere.

10:07.967 --> 10:10.901
They need a little,
um, education.

10:10.903 --> 10:11.971
Oh!

10:12.838 --> 10:14.972
Classy.

10:14.974 --> 10:16.840
Yeah, so take them
to see the Statue of Liberty

10:16.842 --> 10:18.308
and then you go home, okay?

10:18.310 --> 10:19.445
Richard needs you.

10:21.580 --> 10:22.980
I have to call him.

10:22.982 --> 10:24.448
No, please don't. Please...

10:24.450 --> 10:26.819
Don't call him.
You know what'll happen.

10:28.554 --> 10:29.553
He's insane.

10:29.555 --> 10:33.223
Hey. Richard is the best cop
I've ever seen.

10:33.225 --> 10:34.558
Now move your hand.
I wanna call my son.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.462
He's started beating up
Anthony now.

10:46.939 --> 10:47.973
I, uh...

10:50.009 --> 10:51.475
I don't...

10:51.477 --> 10:55.279
I don't wanna come
between you two.

10:55.281 --> 10:57.082
I'm sorry,
but I can't let you stay here.

10:58.250 --> 10:59.418
How about some money?

11:01.287 --> 11:03.086
I don't have anyone else.

11:03.088 --> 11:05.122
He took my credit card.

11:05.124 --> 11:08.427
Just a little money for gas
and food for the boys.

11:10.329 --> 11:11.463
I can't do that.

11:47.366 --> 11:48.367
Excuse me?

12:05.084 --> 12:06.183
Do we like them?

12:06.185 --> 12:08.151
I don't know.
Why don't you try it?

12:08.153 --> 12:09.321
They're good for you.

12:10.456 --> 12:12.022
What's the black stuff?

12:12.024 --> 12:15.127
Um, they're eggs from a fish.
Just try it, okay?

12:16.462 --> 12:19.096
I want you to be worldly.

12:19.098 --> 12:20.230
Fish lay eggs?

12:20.232 --> 12:23.967
Yeah.
They're called hors d'oeuvres.

12:23.969 --> 12:25.035
Where did you get them at?

12:25.037 --> 12:26.372
Mmm, they're from Russia.

12:35.514 --> 12:37.282
- Anna?
- Well...

12:38.016 --> 12:40.617
I used to rent out

12:40.619 --> 12:43.620
non-existing apartments,
get the deposit and then

12:43.622 --> 12:45.455
just disappear
off the face of the earth.

12:45.457 --> 12:49.092
And then I got thousands
of dollars out of

12:49.094 --> 12:52.429
sleepless, lonesome people
selling them

12:52.431 --> 12:54.133
fake melatonin
on the Internet.

12:55.367 --> 12:56.533
So...

12:56.535 --> 12:59.336
Being here
makes me able

12:59.338 --> 13:01.972
to look people
in the eye again.

13:01.974 --> 13:04.709
The other day, for example,
I went right into a store

13:04.711 --> 13:06.610
and bought a bra.

13:06.612 --> 13:08.412
Thank you for sharing that.

13:08.414 --> 13:11.248
It's true. I'm still wearing it.

13:11.250 --> 13:12.382
You wanna have a look?

13:12.384 --> 13:14.084
No, I'll pass.

13:14.086 --> 13:17.020
- John Peter?
- No. Maybe some other time.

13:17.022 --> 13:18.221
Marc,

13:18.223 --> 13:19.389
you're new here.

13:19.391 --> 13:22.259
Do you wanna maybe tell us
a little bit about yourself?

13:23.595 --> 13:26.096
I don't think Marc knows if this
is the right group for him yet.

13:26.098 --> 13:28.465
Forgiveness?
What could be wrong with that?

13:28.467 --> 13:30.267
I'm just here
to support John Peter.

13:30.269 --> 13:32.102
John Peter
is a defense attorney

13:32.104 --> 13:34.204
and he has to live with seeing
guilty people go free

13:34.206 --> 13:36.606
and having innocent people go to
jail for murder and everything.

13:36.608 --> 13:38.208
Thank you very much for that.

13:38.210 --> 13:39.376
The works.

13:39.378 --> 13:41.378
He's lost so, so, so,
so many cases.

13:41.380 --> 13:43.013
Thank you, Bonnie.

13:43.015 --> 13:45.415
John Peter, last week,
was it you

13:45.417 --> 13:48.118
who said that you feel
uncomfortable with other people?

13:48.120 --> 13:49.553
You feel like
you don't trust them?

13:49.555 --> 13:53.290
People lie. Anyone here
can verify that.

13:53.292 --> 13:55.058
Marc, what do you think
about that?

13:55.060 --> 13:57.963
They do. Most people
only think about themselves.

13:59.632 --> 14:02.968
And food.
They are constantly eating.

14:03.402 --> 14:04.568
What about work?

14:04.570 --> 14:06.369
I have a job at a restaurant.

14:06.371 --> 14:07.471
That would explain the eating.

14:07.473 --> 14:08.538
Touche.

14:08.540 --> 14:10.040
Do you talk to anyone
at work?

14:10.042 --> 14:11.308
No, it's Russian.

14:11.310 --> 14:12.643
A Russian restaurant?

14:12.645 --> 14:14.377
Receptions, ballroom...

14:14.379 --> 14:15.481
- Caviar.
- Caviar.

14:18.183 --> 14:19.349
Cameron?

14:19.351 --> 14:21.686
I think it's unbelievable
how many people suck at dancing.

14:21.688 --> 14:22.988
Right.

14:24.657 --> 14:26.556
- Beer?
- Can't. Work.

14:26.558 --> 14:28.826
- Good?
- Yeah, I can do what I want.

14:28.828 --> 14:32.062
I haven't seen anyone
since the day I got the job.

14:32.064 --> 14:33.631
Well, if I find myself
a girlfriend,

14:33.633 --> 14:35.599
we will come and have dinner.

14:35.601 --> 14:38.568
Give it a couple of weeks.
The food is still pretty awful.

14:38.570 --> 14:41.139
So are the women who would
come to have dinner with me.

14:45.477 --> 14:47.344
This is from the hospital.

14:47.346 --> 14:48.715
If I were you,
I'd wear some gloves.

14:49.248 --> 14:51.716
Where are your gloves?

14:51.718 --> 14:54.417
I forgot 'em, but I'll remember
'em tomorrow.

14:54.419 --> 14:55.753
Are you a temp?

14:55.755 --> 14:59.491
Yeah. I'm hoping, though,
if the week goes well, that I can...

15:00.225 --> 15:01.491
Who sorted this?

15:01.493 --> 15:03.628
- This is just not happening.
- What?

15:03.630 --> 15:05.564
Are you aware
of what could have happened?

15:06.565 --> 15:08.231
How could you?

15:08.233 --> 15:11.234
You just...
You just grabbed Beyonce

15:11.236 --> 15:12.469
and threw her in there?

15:12.471 --> 15:15.138
This is his dog.
She's a living person.

15:15.140 --> 15:16.174
Does she look like laundry?

15:18.343 --> 15:19.411
A little bit, kinda.

15:20.579 --> 15:21.846
I'm sorry, Jeff.

15:21.848 --> 15:24.449
The dog is fine,
but Rafael just can't seem to forgive you.

15:25.718 --> 15:27.652
So...

15:40.332 --> 15:41.565
There's an ATM
just around the corner.

15:41.567 --> 15:43.801
I can't take out
any more cash today.

15:43.803 --> 15:45.270
Because my husband...

15:46.739 --> 15:48.438
Um, we've reached our limit
on our card

15:48.440 --> 15:51.474
because he bought a car today
on the card.

15:51.476 --> 15:55.145
A Toyota actually.
A Toyota Avalon, I think.

15:55.147 --> 15:56.381
Have him
come pick you up, then.

16:00.853 --> 16:04.922
If the room's empty already,
what's the harm, right?

16:04.924 --> 16:08.258
We'll be in and out
so quiet and...

16:08.260 --> 16:09.426
I'll clean up after us,

16:09.428 --> 16:10.928
I'll make the beds
in the morning.

16:10.930 --> 16:12.431
No one has to know.

16:13.398 --> 16:14.399
What can you lose?

16:15.601 --> 16:16.803
I'll lose my job.

16:17.737 --> 16:20.170
Then I'll lose my room.

16:20.172 --> 16:21.304
Then I'll lose my address

16:21.306 --> 16:23.108
and my chance
of getting another job.

16:23.643 --> 16:25.308
Sorry.

16:25.310 --> 16:26.478
You just don't look very...

16:27.880 --> 16:29.147
Bankable.

16:48.735 --> 16:50.500
Is this for work?

16:50.502 --> 16:52.437
Soup. Sometimes
it's pretty good.

17:04.383 --> 17:05.384
Are you here to help?

17:05.852 --> 17:07.552
Um... Yeah...

17:08.220 --> 17:09.822
I'm not...

17:11.791 --> 17:13.223
This side?

17:13.225 --> 17:14.426
I'm Alice.

17:31.644 --> 17:32.812
You want these for that.

17:35.648 --> 17:37.449
You're gonna get
the hang of it just fine.

17:44.657 --> 17:45.723
Next!

17:49.696 --> 17:50.863
I need your ID, please.

17:52.031 --> 17:54.264
I can't give it to you.

17:54.266 --> 17:55.966
Is there a search warrant
out for you?

17:55.968 --> 17:57.369
I just can't give it to you.

17:58.270 --> 17:59.704
What, don't you have family?

17:59.706 --> 18:01.371
I have my two sons.

18:01.373 --> 18:02.707
How do I know
they're your kids?

18:02.709 --> 18:04.276
'Cause she's our mom.

18:04.543 --> 18:05.544
Right.

18:06.813 --> 18:08.079
Hi, Glenda.

18:08.081 --> 18:10.315
You know, you can call the
police for protection, if you...

18:11.483 --> 18:12.549
So, there is a warrant
out for you?

18:12.551 --> 18:13.552
No.

18:17.522 --> 18:18.623
Can we just shower?

18:19.859 --> 18:22.594
We'll be in and out.
Ten minutes tops.

18:25.330 --> 18:26.331
Pass me towels.

18:27.365 --> 18:28.433
Just this once.

18:29.936 --> 18:31.068
Thank you.

18:31.070 --> 18:34.038
It's down the hall, okay?
I'll buzz you guys through.

18:34.040 --> 18:36.372
- Thank you.
- Make it quick. Go ahead.

18:39.377 --> 18:40.945
Do you think I
can borrow her computer?

18:40.947 --> 18:43.047
No,
you have to wash your hair.

18:51.824 --> 18:52.892
Hello, Alice.

18:54.026 --> 18:55.960
- Hi, Timofey.
- Can I take your coat?

18:55.962 --> 18:57.496
No, I'm wearing my uniform.

18:59.464 --> 19:00.765
Looks nice in here.

19:00.767 --> 19:01.901
Yeah, I'm not so sure.

19:04.670 --> 19:05.671
Long day?

19:07.840 --> 19:09.041
It's so peaceful here.

19:10.375 --> 19:11.376
Yeah.

19:12.712 --> 19:14.879
I'm just gonna have my usual.
Just a small size.

19:14.881 --> 19:15.882
<i>Spasiba.</i>

19:21.486 --> 19:23.353
Alice is a regular.

19:23.355 --> 19:25.355
She's always alone.

19:25.357 --> 19:27.524
For a while I assumed
she was a manicurist,

19:27.526 --> 19:29.927
which I understand can be quite
demanding in this neighborhood,

19:29.929 --> 19:33.032
but no, she has a totally
different job. Totally.

19:33.766 --> 19:34.767
A nurse.

19:36.468 --> 19:37.935
The consomme of the day,

19:37.937 --> 19:39.804
- just don't make those again.
- Okay.

19:39.806 --> 19:42.006
Perhaps soup is out
of our league.

19:42.008 --> 19:45.475
I usually just tell people that we're
out of everything except for the caviar.

19:45.477 --> 19:48.444
People like it and you can't go
wrong, it's straight out of a can.

19:48.446 --> 19:50.480
Can you just stay out
of the kitchen, please?

19:50.482 --> 19:52.582
Sorry, yeah.

19:52.584 --> 19:55.518
Small size caviar, three
pancakes, no lemon, please.

19:55.520 --> 19:57.888
Oh, by the way,
I think my grandfather left

19:57.890 --> 20:00.658
a couple of interesting
champagne coolers

20:00.660 --> 20:02.592
in your apartment. You could
take them down here

20:02.594 --> 20:04.762
if you need cabinet space
up there for the...

20:04.764 --> 20:07.465
For the clothes you don't
really seem to have.

20:15.007 --> 20:16.472
Wow!

20:36.028 --> 20:37.460
Now, read, okay?

20:37.462 --> 20:38.896
I don't like to read.

20:38.898 --> 20:42.032
I know. You gotta try.
I'll be back really soon.

20:42.034 --> 20:43.035
Be quiet, okay?

20:44.971 --> 20:45.972
Stay where you are.

20:53.145 --> 20:54.745
How did that work out for you?

20:54.747 --> 20:56.714
Oh, nothing worked for me.

20:56.716 --> 20:59.183
Let me know if I can help you
with something else. I'm Stella.

20:59.185 --> 21:00.418
Thank you.

21:38.658 --> 21:39.992
Here. Food.

21:42.228 --> 21:43.896
Come on, Anthony.
It's time to get up.

21:46.699 --> 21:47.800
Where's Jude?

21:48.968 --> 21:50.600
He's not here?

21:50.602 --> 21:52.770
He was here before.

21:52.772 --> 21:54.238
How long
have you been sleeping?

21:54.240 --> 21:55.873
I wasn't sleeping.

21:55.875 --> 21:57.209
Why do you look like a spy?

21:58.244 --> 22:00.012
I told you
to stay where you were.

22:00.578 --> 22:01.579
Jude!

22:02.882 --> 22:04.580
Jude!

22:04.582 --> 22:05.583
Come on.

22:08.620 --> 22:10.254
He probably went
back to the car.

22:10.256 --> 22:11.958
He won't remember
where we parked.

22:18.530 --> 22:20.530
Maybe he went up to a cop.

22:20.532 --> 22:21.865
I told him he can't do that.

22:21.867 --> 22:22.935
Jude!

22:23.836 --> 22:25.037
Jude!

22:26.672 --> 22:27.873
Jude!

22:36.215 --> 22:38.048
Mom!

22:38.050 --> 22:39.218
- Anthony.
- Mom, Jude!

22:43.956 --> 22:45.490
Mom, hi!

22:46.993 --> 22:48.959
You must be out of your mind.

22:48.961 --> 22:50.861
We almost had to call
the fire department.

22:50.863 --> 22:52.129
That would have been great.

22:52.131 --> 22:53.998
Or the police.
Can you imagine?

22:54.000 --> 22:55.799
I could have lost you.

22:55.801 --> 22:58.536
I wanna see more of Manhattan
while I'm here.

22:59.571 --> 23:01.741
You will.
We're not going home.

23:02.641 --> 23:04.208
I want some food.

23:04.210 --> 23:05.075
Some Russian food.

23:05.077 --> 23:07.044
Not right now.

23:07.046 --> 23:08.746
Some hors d'oeuvres, please.

23:08.748 --> 23:10.647
I'm thinking
those little eggs.

23:10.649 --> 23:12.084
I said not right now.

23:15.654 --> 23:17.254
We're never going back, right?

23:17.256 --> 23:18.789
No, honey, we're on vacation.

23:18.791 --> 23:20.190
- Promise?
- Yes.

23:20.192 --> 23:21.260
Get in the car.

24:23.789 --> 24:25.022
Listen.

24:25.024 --> 24:26.158
Where are we?

24:26.792 --> 24:28.058
It's real.

24:33.866 --> 24:36.268
It must be coming
from a concert hall.

24:36.936 --> 24:38.235
What's that?

24:38.237 --> 24:40.304
It's a theater

24:40.306 --> 24:41.972
but only with music.

24:41.974 --> 24:44.274
So what do you look at?

24:44.276 --> 24:46.745
I think people
mostly just close their eyes.

25:24.450 --> 25:26.216
It's back through there

25:26.218 --> 25:27.853
and up the stairs.

25:29.021 --> 25:32.022
- Excuse me?
- Sorry. It's my accent.

25:32.024 --> 25:34.424
The ladies' room is back

25:34.426 --> 25:36.426
through there
and up the stairs

25:36.428 --> 25:38.063
and is, uh...

25:38.697 --> 25:40.366
"badabing" the correct word?

25:41.300 --> 25:42.835
I think so.

25:44.236 --> 25:45.237
Thank you.

26:34.253 --> 26:35.552
More?

26:35.554 --> 26:37.022
Thank you.

26:44.196 --> 26:46.263
You weren't here
for the dinner, were you?

26:46.265 --> 26:47.397
No, I had to work late.

26:47.399 --> 26:49.199
I'm an interior decorator.

26:49.201 --> 26:51.935
I do hotels, so...

26:51.937 --> 26:53.339
You know, mostly bedrooms.

26:54.206 --> 26:55.908
- Bedrooms?
- Mmm.

26:58.177 --> 26:59.745
Are you part of the family?

27:02.114 --> 27:03.282
Um, yes.

27:06.018 --> 27:07.351
I'm the aunt.

27:07.353 --> 27:08.354
The aunt?

27:09.388 --> 27:10.889
This is a silver anniversary.

27:11.423 --> 27:13.259
Well, Glenda and Dave...

27:14.493 --> 27:16.026
They got married so young.

27:16.028 --> 27:17.928
- Glenda and Dave?
- Mmm-hmm.

27:17.930 --> 27:19.365
I thought they were Russian.

27:21.567 --> 27:24.036
The parents gave them
American names.

27:25.271 --> 27:27.838
But, you know,
we love them to pieces anyway.

27:42.521 --> 27:44.523
Ah, babushka, there you are!

27:45.424 --> 27:47.126
It's those ones over there.

27:47.459 --> 27:48.827
Of course.

27:54.033 --> 27:55.134
Thank you.

27:56.135 --> 27:57.169
Bye-bye.

28:16.455 --> 28:20.257
What are you doing up there?
Come on down. Come on.

28:20.259 --> 28:21.425
Where were you?

28:21.427 --> 28:24.094
Just at a party.
It wasn't fun. Come on.

28:24.096 --> 28:25.896
Was Dad there?

28:25.898 --> 28:27.331
No, honey,
he can't find us.

28:27.333 --> 28:29.634
It's too big a city.
Let's go.

28:29.636 --> 28:32.202
Do we have any food?

28:32.204 --> 28:35.205
What were you doing up there?
Was it the music?

28:35.207 --> 28:38.375
I couldn't sleep.
Do we have any food?

28:38.377 --> 28:40.379
I'll find something.
Let's get in.

29:03.670 --> 29:05.437
<i>What do other people do?</i>

29:07.640 --> 29:09.241
Where do they go?

29:10.976 --> 29:12.945
Probably sleep
on someone's...

29:13.979 --> 29:15.514
...fold-out bed.

29:17.216 --> 29:19.151
Maybe they go
to their family.

29:21.019 --> 29:22.287
Folks...

29:24.990 --> 29:28.460
Yeah. Other people have folks.
We don't.

29:31.163 --> 29:32.598
Dad...

29:33.499 --> 29:35.134
I hate him.

29:36.468 --> 29:39.171
Once he made me
hit Jude.

29:40.506 --> 29:41.940
Hard.

29:43.008 --> 29:45.544
Otherwise he'd
beat us both up.

29:46.679 --> 29:48.414
So I did it.

29:50.015 --> 29:53.352
I hit Jude a lot of times.

29:55.688 --> 29:58.123
It's not your fault.

30:44.637 --> 30:46.403
Hey, um... Hey.

30:46.405 --> 30:48.305
I'm sorry
I keep pestering you.

30:48.307 --> 30:50.073
You didn't have to do that.

30:50.075 --> 30:52.242
I'm not even a psychologist.

30:52.244 --> 30:55.111
It's fine. I'm just here
to keep John Peter company.

30:55.113 --> 30:57.214
You are terrific.

30:57.216 --> 30:59.049
Seriously. I know...

30:59.051 --> 31:03.587
I for one would be toast
if it wasn't for this and you.

31:03.589 --> 31:06.122
She's very good, Marc.
You can talk to her.

31:06.124 --> 31:07.660
You don't have to talk to me.

31:12.765 --> 31:14.199
Tell her.

31:16.502 --> 31:18.268
It was his brother.

31:18.270 --> 31:20.203
They worked
at a restaurant together.

31:20.205 --> 31:24.441
His brother was a drug addict
and a dealer. Um...

31:24.443 --> 31:27.645
Marc tried in vain
to get him out of that stuff,

31:27.647 --> 31:29.446
but his brother just

31:29.448 --> 31:32.717
kept on doing bad stuff
with very bad people.

31:32.719 --> 31:35.285
One day the police
raided their restaurant.

31:35.287 --> 31:37.155
Judge gave him eight years.

31:37.824 --> 31:39.189
Marc didn't want to appeal.

31:39.191 --> 31:40.559
You were his attorney?

31:42.594 --> 31:45.763
John Peter got me out
after four years.

31:45.765 --> 31:48.465
My brother died
of an overdose

31:48.467 --> 31:51.136
after I'd been in prison
for two years.

31:53.138 --> 31:54.506
I ran the kitchen there.

31:58.645 --> 32:00.412
I'm completely over it now.

32:02.247 --> 32:03.415
Right.

32:05.852 --> 32:08.721
Uh, I'm so sorry.
I've gotta get to my other job.

32:09.121 --> 32:11.254
Yeah. Um...

32:11.256 --> 32:12.823
You want us to walk you
to the subway?

32:12.825 --> 32:14.357
Maybe another time.

32:14.359 --> 32:15.695
I think I'd like that.

32:30.877 --> 32:32.210
We should go.

32:33.746 --> 32:36.681
Just ten more minutes.
I just wanna check something.

32:36.683 --> 32:38.214
We gotta get back
to the car.

32:38.216 --> 32:40.419
Next time.
Let's go. Come on.

32:42.521 --> 32:44.154
Why?

32:44.156 --> 32:45.756
Because...

32:45.758 --> 32:48.460
The bigger the city,
the more parking tickets you get.

32:51.864 --> 32:53.831
What is it you keep doing
on that computer?

32:53.833 --> 32:56.801
Nothing.
Don't worry about it, Mom.

32:56.803 --> 32:58.268
Where are we going?

32:58.270 --> 32:59.639
Sightseeing.

33:02.775 --> 33:06.209
Sometimes I see people
that look like Dad.

33:06.211 --> 33:08.681
I know, honey,
but it's just the uniforms.

33:09.949 --> 33:12.917
Can he find us when
we get parking tickets?

33:12.919 --> 33:14.453
Not in New York.

33:16.555 --> 33:17.757
Wait a minute.

33:22.361 --> 33:23.663
This is where
we parked, right?

33:24.764 --> 33:26.733
Yeah. Where's the car?

33:30.268 --> 33:32.270
Promise we won't go home?

33:34.573 --> 33:36.339
Yeah.

33:36.341 --> 33:37.875
It's just
the parking tickets.

33:37.877 --> 33:40.410
They can take the car

33:40.412 --> 33:41.946
and put it in a lot
somewhere.

33:41.948 --> 33:42.813
Can we get it back?

33:42.815 --> 33:44.982
- It's in your dad's name.
- Mmm.

33:44.984 --> 33:46.784
Well, when you live
in New York

33:46.786 --> 33:48.653
you don't really
want a car, so...

33:48.655 --> 33:50.489
That is exactly
what I thought.

33:51.289 --> 33:52.491
I'm cold.

33:53.893 --> 33:55.225
Hey, guess what?

33:55.227 --> 33:56.961
I've got a surprise for you.

33:56.963 --> 33:58.328
What is it?

33:58.330 --> 34:01.899
A surprise. Come on,
come on, come on!

34:19.284 --> 34:21.620
Well, I think we can just
sit down, don't you?

34:30.295 --> 34:31.463
Mmm.

34:42.775 --> 34:45.442
I think they've forgotten us.

34:45.444 --> 34:47.610
It's a pity
the service is so bad

34:47.612 --> 34:49.512
since the food
is so delicious, huh?

34:49.514 --> 34:50.883
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

34:54.453 --> 34:56.756
I don't think
I'm hungry anymore. Are you?

34:57.924 --> 34:59.726
No, not really.

35:00.126 --> 35:01.326
Not really.

35:08.467 --> 35:10.302
God, I'm so glad
you're all right.

35:12.004 --> 35:13.271
I'll buy you dinner.

35:19.645 --> 35:21.578
How did you find us?

35:21.580 --> 35:23.983
I'm a cop. I've got friends.

35:25.718 --> 35:27.385
Boys, what can I get you?

35:27.920 --> 35:28.921
Hmm?

35:32.058 --> 35:34.324
Clara...

35:34.326 --> 35:36.996
Something sweet and sour?

35:38.064 --> 35:39.663
S...

35:39.665 --> 35:41.364
Soda... Soda.

35:41.366 --> 35:42.869
Soda, good, yeah. Jude?

35:43.903 --> 35:45.568
Thank you.

35:45.570 --> 35:46.605
Here you are, sir.

35:48.074 --> 35:50.442
- Thanks.
- For you, sir.

35:53.079 --> 35:54.779
Can I go to the bathroom?

35:54.781 --> 35:56.314
It's down the hall.

36:00.653 --> 36:01.654
Sure.

36:04.857 --> 36:06.424
This is for you.

36:06.793 --> 36:07.994
Thank you.

36:12.665 --> 36:13.666
Please...

36:15.433 --> 36:16.533
Please come home.

36:16.535 --> 36:19.538
It's been a long time now,
you've made your point.

36:20.338 --> 36:22.507
I'll forgive you.
Just come home.

36:24.677 --> 36:26.378
We need each other, right?

36:28.114 --> 36:30.348
I just need a few more days.

36:31.150 --> 36:32.817
You know
I can't give you that.

36:32.819 --> 36:34.053
The boys need their father.

36:35.855 --> 36:36.954
Oh!

36:36.956 --> 36:39.857
I... I should... Can I?

36:39.859 --> 36:41.591
Yeah.

36:41.593 --> 36:43.560
- Come on.
- Sorry.

36:43.562 --> 36:44.563
It's okay.

36:45.430 --> 36:46.498
Come on.

36:49.601 --> 36:50.837
Here you go.

36:52.905 --> 36:55.975
Mom! Mom! Over here.

37:02.014 --> 37:03.082
Go!

37:06.551 --> 37:07.987
Come on!

37:22.434 --> 37:23.568
Hey.

37:25.570 --> 37:27.137
Thanks.

37:27.139 --> 37:28.471
Thank you, sir.

37:28.473 --> 37:29.608
No problem.

37:32.645 --> 37:34.113
- There you go.
- Thank you.

37:34.847 --> 37:35.915
Thank you.

37:44.156 --> 37:47.590
Hey. Do you need something?

37:47.592 --> 37:48.628
Jude.

37:49.561 --> 37:51.795
Thank you. Say thank you.

37:51.797 --> 37:53.866
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

37:56.002 --> 37:57.535
Are we still on vacation?

37:58.470 --> 38:00.538
Not so much. No.

38:01.140 --> 38:02.740
Are we homeless?

38:02.742 --> 38:05.978
We are no more homeless
than anyone else here.

38:07.780 --> 38:08.814
Are you homeless?

38:11.183 --> 38:12.550
Jude.

38:14.552 --> 38:15.888
Oh.

38:21.928 --> 38:23.029
Hey.

38:23.629 --> 38:24.695
Hey, Will.

38:24.697 --> 38:26.163
I've been trying
to reach you.

38:26.165 --> 38:27.563
Yeah...

38:27.565 --> 38:28.866
Don't you have a phone?

38:28.868 --> 38:30.002
I lost it.

38:31.270 --> 38:32.468
That's not true.

38:32.470 --> 38:36.206
It was on top of the toaster
and then it slipped inside.

38:36.208 --> 38:39.843
And then I turned on the
toaster and so I melted it.

38:39.845 --> 38:41.647
Is that why the power
went off last week?

38:43.683 --> 38:44.915
Could be.

38:44.917 --> 38:46.684
I was in the middle
of drying my hair.

38:46.686 --> 38:47.685
Looks nice.

38:47.687 --> 38:49.787
And the whole building's
complained. And, Jeff,

38:49.789 --> 38:51.822
you're four months behind
with the rent.

38:51.824 --> 38:52.890
I know.

38:52.892 --> 38:54.559
When's the next time
you get paid?

38:55.127 --> 38:56.494
Ahh...

38:58.164 --> 39:00.563
Well, then that'll be
the next time I get paid.

39:00.565 --> 39:01.932
Well, that makes sense.

39:01.934 --> 39:03.667
Look, I'm gonna need
those keys.

39:03.669 --> 39:05.903
I've got new people
coming in at 6:00.

39:05.905 --> 39:07.304
I can only give you an hour.

39:07.306 --> 39:08.772
Why didn't you call me?

39:08.774 --> 39:09.809
Your phone melted.

39:15.580 --> 39:16.780
But this is my apartment.

39:16.782 --> 39:17.783
No, it's not.

39:19.885 --> 39:21.952
That's my bed.

39:21.954 --> 39:23.122
Not really.

39:23.856 --> 39:25.490
That's my blanket.

39:27.760 --> 39:30.294
And the picture on the wall,

39:30.296 --> 39:32.665
and the magazine
and my shoes.

39:34.734 --> 39:37.670
That's my yellow toothbrush.

40:11.603 --> 40:14.038
Male African American,
early 50s.

40:14.040 --> 40:15.873
We don't think
he has an address.

40:15.875 --> 40:17.708
Fractured skull,
partial spinal fracture.

40:17.710 --> 40:18.976
We're gonna
take care of you.

40:20.179 --> 40:21.812
Can I get some
blood work and a second IV?

40:21.814 --> 40:23.080
I need one liter of bolus.

40:24.350 --> 40:26.750
I've got no pulse.
He's coding. One amp of Epi.

40:26.752 --> 40:27.753
I'll get it.

41:08.360 --> 41:10.963
- You're good?
- Yeah, I'm good, man. Thanks.

41:13.232 --> 41:15.234
Sir?

41:16.936 --> 41:18.836
Come on,
we gotta get him up.

41:18.838 --> 41:21.038
Come with us.
We're here to help.

41:21.040 --> 41:22.875
I don't need any help.

41:23.809 --> 41:25.209
I got you.

41:25.211 --> 41:26.276
It's cold.

41:26.278 --> 41:27.711
Hold on.

41:27.713 --> 41:28.848
Have you done any drugs?

41:29.949 --> 41:31.183
Can you remember?

41:32.017 --> 41:33.385
I don't do drugs.

41:34.753 --> 41:36.088
I'm just cold!

41:38.757 --> 41:40.826
Ah, I'm just cold!

42:00.980 --> 42:03.015
Why are you
wearing that dress?

42:05.017 --> 42:06.285
I work here.

42:07.486 --> 42:09.021
It's my day job.

42:15.027 --> 42:16.362
I'm not dead, am I?

42:18.497 --> 42:20.866
They got you just in time.

42:29.208 --> 42:30.209
Thank you.

43:06.178 --> 43:07.980
Would you like me
to take those for you?

43:09.348 --> 43:10.349
Sorry?

43:11.150 --> 43:13.250
The sandwiches.

43:13.252 --> 43:14.753
No, thank you.

43:17.523 --> 43:18.891
I'll see you out.

43:27.866 --> 43:29.368
I used to work

43:30.169 --> 43:32.137
when I was about 17

43:33.339 --> 43:36.075
in a place called
Curtis' Curtains.

43:37.209 --> 43:39.378
They made some really
beautiful things.

43:40.212 --> 43:41.280
Drapes.

43:45.884 --> 43:47.319
Then...

43:50.055 --> 43:51.890
Curtis...

43:53.959 --> 43:55.527
...thought I was stealing,

43:57.129 --> 43:58.497
which I wasn't.

44:00.299 --> 44:02.768
I just made a mistake
with the computer.

44:03.469 --> 44:05.302
Did he say he was sorry?

44:05.304 --> 44:07.337
No.

44:07.339 --> 44:09.375
He didn't.
He called the police.

44:10.542 --> 44:12.311
Two policemen came.

44:13.846 --> 44:15.447
And one of them stayed.

44:16.548 --> 44:18.117
That was your father.

44:18.984 --> 44:20.452
In his uniform.

44:21.253 --> 44:23.553
He didn't arrest me.

44:23.555 --> 44:25.424
He just asked me on a date.

44:27.926 --> 44:31.330
And we got married not long
after that and then you came

44:32.865 --> 44:33.999
and...

44:35.968 --> 44:37.836
I never needed a new job.

44:40.139 --> 44:42.572
What if he finds us again?

44:42.574 --> 44:44.443
He is a police officer.

44:45.344 --> 44:47.279
And you've been stealing.

44:48.881 --> 44:51.048
What do you know about it?

44:51.050 --> 44:54.217
Mom... Prada shoes.

44:54.219 --> 44:57.020
Those weren't Prada.
Those were Florsheim.

44:57.022 --> 45:00.257
And they were suddenly just
there instead of my old ones.

45:00.259 --> 45:02.861
I never steal from anyone
it will matter to.

45:05.364 --> 45:07.199
You just deserve the best.

45:09.268 --> 45:11.470
You deserve to be educated.

45:14.674 --> 45:18.444
You should look smart.
That way you'll become smart.

45:19.211 --> 45:20.212
Yeah.

45:31.557 --> 45:33.192
Would you like
a pair of these?

45:33.660 --> 45:34.860
Yeah, uh...

45:35.594 --> 45:37.427
Don't you have any?

45:37.429 --> 45:41.033
I probably had some mittens
when I was a kid. I don't know.

45:43.202 --> 45:47.039
Maybe you can wait to finish
until it stops snowing.

45:47.473 --> 45:49.172
Yeah, uh...

45:49.174 --> 45:53.043
I was gonna finish up real
quick and then I'll be done.

45:53.045 --> 45:55.345
It's amazing how quickly you've
gotten the hang of everything.

45:55.347 --> 45:56.714
You think so?

45:56.716 --> 45:59.218
Yeah. Forgiveness is here.
I gotta head off.

46:07.627 --> 46:09.960
- Let's pencil out that.
- It's so cold in here.

46:09.962 --> 46:11.261
- Okay.
- It's so cold in here.

46:11.263 --> 46:12.329
No ice. I'm sorry.

46:12.331 --> 46:15.198
Our trays are 20 years old.

46:15.200 --> 46:16.266
Never any ice.

46:16.268 --> 46:17.970
Okay, so let's start.

46:21.573 --> 46:23.006
Lloyd?

46:23.008 --> 46:26.042
You know, I could bring in some
ice cube trays from home next time.

46:26.044 --> 46:28.979
Five or six of them.
I remember that suggestion we had

46:28.981 --> 46:30.347
that you should
love thy neighbor

46:30.349 --> 46:33.751
before your neighbor
loves you, uh,

46:33.753 --> 46:35.686
whatever that is.

46:35.688 --> 46:36.854
Bonnie.

46:36.856 --> 46:38.455
Shouldn't I just go ahead
and say the phrase correctly?

46:38.457 --> 46:40.357
No.

46:40.359 --> 46:42.561
Is there still
nobody you like, Marc?

46:44.263 --> 46:45.462
No.

46:45.464 --> 46:47.765
Come on, Marc.

46:47.767 --> 46:51.103
You and me, we're kind of
friends, aren't we?

46:52.104 --> 46:53.470
You don't count.

46:53.472 --> 46:54.641
Obviously not.

47:01.280 --> 47:03.346
Some weeks ago,

47:03.348 --> 47:04.651
in the restaurant,

47:05.718 --> 47:07.152
there was a...

47:07.754 --> 47:09.288
A woman.

47:11.089 --> 47:12.090
She...

47:17.396 --> 47:18.295
No.

47:18.297 --> 47:20.363
Great. Now everything
falls in place.

47:20.365 --> 47:21.565
Shh.

47:21.567 --> 47:23.433
What about you, Bonnie?

47:23.435 --> 47:26.104
Did you get manage to get through
the week without hitting your dog?

47:27.506 --> 47:29.439
I think that one's open.

47:29.441 --> 47:31.443
But Mom
doesn't like churches.

47:32.544 --> 47:34.211
But it's warm.

47:45.090 --> 47:47.159
Like I said, man,
nobody expects you to open up.

47:47.559 --> 47:48.728
Me neither.

48:02.508 --> 48:05.275
Oh! I'm just about
to close the church.

48:05.277 --> 48:07.277
Can we just stay for a
couple of minutes to warm up?

48:07.279 --> 48:10.313
I'm so sorry, I've got to get
to my other job at the hospital.

48:10.315 --> 48:11.682
Is there a library nearby?

48:11.684 --> 48:13.653
There is, but that's about
to close too.

48:15.454 --> 48:17.657
You guys don't have
anywhere else to go, do you?

48:18.357 --> 48:19.626
No, we don't.

48:22.461 --> 48:24.361
- There's a fold-up bed.
- Anthony!

48:24.363 --> 48:27.698
Perhaps you can just stay
in my office tonight.

48:27.700 --> 48:31.234
They close the doors
but, uh, Jeff, the volunteer,

48:31.236 --> 48:32.437
he'll be here in the morning
and open up.

48:35.340 --> 48:36.473
Can you help me?

48:36.475 --> 48:38.176
- Yes, of course.
- Sure.

48:38.544 --> 48:39.578
Okay?

48:42.514 --> 48:44.082
I'm not supposed to do this.

48:47.185 --> 48:48.520
Thank you so much.

48:53.325 --> 48:54.659
Alice,

48:54.661 --> 48:57.494
can you do a 12-hour shift?
I'm understaffed in the morning.

48:57.496 --> 48:58.963
Sure.

48:58.965 --> 49:01.166
I figured most of the others got
kids, and no one's waiting for you.

49:03.502 --> 49:04.536
Yeah, of course.

49:05.905 --> 49:07.406
Your watch.

51:48.868 --> 51:49.969
Jude.

51:50.803 --> 51:51.938
Jude?

52:17.930 --> 52:19.397
Jude?

52:22.334 --> 52:23.435
Jude!

52:24.704 --> 52:25.872
Come on.

52:34.781 --> 52:36.546
Is he dead?

52:36.548 --> 52:38.548
He just won't wake up.
Come on.

52:38.550 --> 52:39.917
- Take his clothes off.
- Anthony, stop it!

52:39.919 --> 52:42.385
- I just needed to check his pulse!
- Get away from your brother.

52:42.387 --> 52:43.453
Oh, my God.

52:43.455 --> 52:45.388
I think he has hypothermia.

52:45.390 --> 52:48.027
Come on, baby,
wake up. Wake up.

53:11.984 --> 53:13.518
Careful.

53:31.971 --> 53:34.372
Please just leave us alone.

53:35.675 --> 53:37.540
Your son's not dead.

53:37.542 --> 53:39.078
There's a chance
he'll still pull through.

53:40.680 --> 53:42.445
Can I see him?
Where is he?

53:42.447 --> 53:43.749
He's sleeping.

53:46.686 --> 53:48.652
Can you just
take me back there?

53:48.654 --> 53:50.388
We have to wait
for the police first.

53:51.523 --> 53:53.125
It's protocol. I'm sorry.

53:55.928 --> 53:57.795
We called your father.
He's on his way. Don't worry.

53:57.797 --> 54:00.965
You can't call him!
You can't call him!

54:00.967 --> 54:02.299
Please tell them, please!

54:02.301 --> 54:05.970
You can't call them. Please tell
them you can't call the police.

54:05.972 --> 54:07.539
I think they already have.

54:08.607 --> 54:10.573
If they call my husband...

54:10.575 --> 54:14.712
If they call him, he will take my kids.
He'll kill them.

54:14.714 --> 54:16.613
Do you have
any other family?

54:16.615 --> 54:19.083
Would you like to just come
back to my office at the church?

54:19.085 --> 54:20.818
No, he'll find us.

54:20.820 --> 54:22.552
We called the ambulance
from there.

54:22.554 --> 54:25.155
Mom, he'll get you arrested.
He'll take Jude.

54:25.157 --> 54:27.024
Nobody's gonna take Jude anywhere.
I work here,

54:27.026 --> 54:29.095
I'm gonna make sure of that.
Come here.

54:31.030 --> 54:32.632
He wouldn't survive it.

54:34.566 --> 54:36.934
Where can I take you?
Let me take you somewhere.

54:36.936 --> 54:38.403
Somewhere warm?

54:45.177 --> 54:46.744
He's in good hands.

54:46.746 --> 54:48.511
- You'll take care of him?
- Mmm-hmm.

54:48.513 --> 54:49.780
You'll make sure he's okay?

54:49.782 --> 54:52.617
We're gonna do everything
we can. All right?

54:54.220 --> 54:56.519
Yeah. It's going to be okay.

55:01.694 --> 55:04.662
I've gotta go back
to the hospital.

55:04.664 --> 55:07.530
But I thought maybe,
you know, some coffee

55:07.532 --> 55:10.102
or an omelet perhaps.

55:11.804 --> 55:13.639
Look, I'm gonna
look after your son.

55:15.174 --> 55:17.944
You know, if anything
changes, I'll find you.

55:21.647 --> 55:24.482
Um, sorry. I'm gonna
be back in a minute.

56:03.889 --> 56:07.024
All right, guys. It's late.

56:07.026 --> 56:08.726
We'll finish up tomorrow.

56:08.728 --> 56:11.263
Thank you.
You did good tonight.

58:47.953 --> 58:48.954
Glass?

58:49.421 --> 58:52.456
Sorry. So sorry.

58:52.458 --> 58:53.926
No, it's fine.

58:55.060 --> 58:57.663
You've been sleeping
for a long time.

58:59.732 --> 59:01.231
I'll go in a minute.

59:01.233 --> 59:04.768
Is there anything
I can help you with?

59:04.770 --> 59:08.307
Just please don't tell anyone
that we were here.

59:09.241 --> 59:11.243
Is the boy okay?

59:12.011 --> 59:14.180
I have two boys.

59:16.148 --> 59:18.050
The little one...

59:22.788 --> 59:24.223
He's in the hospital.

59:27.059 --> 59:29.962
I'm nothing.
I'm just a housewife.

59:34.066 --> 59:37.367
One day I came home,
and my...

59:37.369 --> 59:41.006
My husband was
beating up my boy,

59:43.108 --> 59:46.977
Anthony, because he'd left
a spoon by the sink.

59:46.979 --> 59:49.882
He'd put him
on the dining room table.

59:52.084 --> 59:53.986
It must have happened before.

59:56.989 --> 1:00:00.759
The boys had always
wanted to go to the city.

1:00:01.460 --> 1:00:03.229
We slept in the car.

1:00:05.898 --> 1:00:08.966
Parked in the alley here
a few times.

1:00:08.968 --> 1:00:10.267
I know.

1:00:10.269 --> 1:00:12.271
In the beginning, I thought

1:00:13.872 --> 1:00:15.841
he'll just do it to me.

1:00:18.143 --> 1:00:20.045
The boys would miss him...

1:00:21.046 --> 1:00:23.413
...if we left.

1:00:23.415 --> 1:00:25.515
Why don't you go
to the police?

1:00:25.517 --> 1:00:27.517
My husband is the police.

1:00:27.519 --> 1:00:30.988
He has so many friends there,
he'll find us.

1:00:30.990 --> 1:00:32.956
Uh, I'm heading home.

1:00:32.958 --> 1:00:34.891
And if I have to say so myself,

1:00:34.893 --> 1:00:37.027
the champagne pyramid
really worked this time.

1:00:37.029 --> 1:00:38.095
I thought you were a Russian.

1:00:38.097 --> 1:00:40.897
Uh, sorry, yeah,

1:00:40.899 --> 1:00:42.866
no, I grew up here.

1:00:42.868 --> 1:00:45.269
My advisors tell us
to speak with an accent

1:00:45.271 --> 1:00:47.504
for the sake of the guests.
I find it very humiliating,

1:00:47.506 --> 1:00:51.541
and hands down, my name isn't
Timofey, it's just Tim Mortimer.

1:00:55.848 --> 1:00:57.581
For what it's worth,
Irina in the coat check,

1:00:57.583 --> 1:00:58.915
she isn't Russian either.

1:00:58.917 --> 1:01:00.183
Her name is Doris.
She's from Newark.

1:01:00.185 --> 1:01:03.587
Not now.
Just, just go, please.

1:01:07.092 --> 1:01:08.258
I'm so sorry.

1:01:08.260 --> 1:01:09.495
He's nice.

1:01:10.596 --> 1:01:11.797
Is he?

1:01:12.431 --> 1:01:13.930
Where were you?

1:01:25.611 --> 1:01:26.912
Thank you.

1:01:40.225 --> 1:01:42.194
We won't
bother you again.

1:01:46.965 --> 1:01:48.932
Bathroom?

1:01:48.934 --> 1:01:50.600
Here we go.

1:01:50.602 --> 1:01:53.437
Yeah. We should wash up.

1:01:53.439 --> 1:01:56.306
Hey, Sid.
Can I get you a sweater?

1:01:57.910 --> 1:01:59.078
Sorry.

1:02:00.012 --> 1:02:02.212
Is that okay?

1:02:02.214 --> 1:02:04.114
How about some socks?

1:02:04.116 --> 1:02:05.451
Thanks a lot.

1:02:07.920 --> 1:02:09.687
Hey.

1:02:09.689 --> 1:02:11.521
You guys need anything?

1:02:11.523 --> 1:02:13.192
I'll tell Alice
you were here.

1:02:20.366 --> 1:02:23.100
Lady? Is this your son?

1:02:23.102 --> 1:02:25.402
He was downstairs
in one of those stalls.

1:02:25.404 --> 1:02:28.307
He was crying so hard
I had to break the door.

1:02:30.309 --> 1:02:32.244
Is this your mom, son?

1:02:32.712 --> 1:02:34.313
Is she sick?

1:02:36.148 --> 1:02:38.148
Is there anything
I can do for you?

1:02:38.150 --> 1:02:39.451
No, thank you.

1:02:41.153 --> 1:02:42.655
Maybe I could
get you a cigarette?

1:02:43.288 --> 1:02:44.423
No.

1:02:46.225 --> 1:02:49.526
Lady! Lady!

1:02:49.528 --> 1:02:52.162
Lady, I'm trying to help you.

1:02:52.164 --> 1:02:54.366
You're looking at me
like I'm dirt.

1:02:55.334 --> 1:02:57.067
You're no better than me.

1:02:57.069 --> 1:02:59.004
I've got children, too.

1:03:01.106 --> 1:03:02.274
I had a home.

1:03:03.375 --> 1:03:04.642
I had insurance!

1:03:04.644 --> 1:03:06.076
Bill!

1:03:06.078 --> 1:03:07.745
I had a job! I had a life, lady!

1:03:07.747 --> 1:03:10.380
Hey! Hey, hey, come on,
come on, come on. Come on.

1:03:10.382 --> 1:03:12.616
- She's not looking at me.
- Bill, Bill, all right...

1:03:12.618 --> 1:03:13.684
She's not looking at me.

1:03:13.686 --> 1:03:16.319
- Bill, calm down. Calm down.
- She doesn't see me!

1:03:16.321 --> 1:03:18.288
She doesn't see me, Jeff.

1:03:18.290 --> 1:03:21.091
I see you. Calm down.

1:03:21.093 --> 1:03:23.226
Okay.

1:03:23.228 --> 1:03:25.763
She just needs
to be left alone.

1:03:29.101 --> 1:03:33.236
Please, Mom,
please just open your eyes.

1:03:33.238 --> 1:03:36.308
Just open your eyes, please!

1:03:38.043 --> 1:03:42.479
Don't give up, Mom.
Please don't give up.

1:03:59.766 --> 1:04:02.032
I don't care about the rules.
I'm his dad.

1:04:02.034 --> 1:04:03.634
I'm sorry,
it's because of the circumstances.

1:04:03.636 --> 1:04:05.235
I know, but he needs me.

1:04:05.237 --> 1:04:07.204
I'm sorry, he's not my patient.

1:04:07.206 --> 1:04:08.706
I can't just wait here for days.

1:04:08.708 --> 1:04:11.408
I have to see my son now!

1:04:11.410 --> 1:04:13.143
Do something, will you?

1:04:13.145 --> 1:04:14.544
As far as I know,

1:04:14.546 --> 1:04:16.814
your son has had a shock,

1:04:16.816 --> 1:04:19.115
but he's better now,
and I have an emergency.

1:04:19.117 --> 1:04:20.550
I'll have someone look into it.

1:04:20.552 --> 1:04:22.321
So, please, just stay
right here.

1:04:43.442 --> 1:04:45.208
Can you grab that?

1:04:47.714 --> 1:04:49.381
Hello, Alice.

1:05:11.270 --> 1:05:12.538
Look...

1:05:14.807 --> 1:05:16.643
You can stay at my place.

1:05:19.244 --> 1:05:23.048
It's in the top floor
of the building where I work.

1:05:31.523 --> 1:05:33.058
Okay.

1:05:38.698 --> 1:05:40.332
Come on.

1:05:42.635 --> 1:05:43.703
Come on.

1:06:00.887 --> 1:06:02.586
There's a bedroom over there.

1:06:02.588 --> 1:06:04.590
I usually sleep in here anyway.

1:06:07.459 --> 1:06:09.328
Here are the keys.

1:06:12.699 --> 1:06:13.766
Thank you.

1:06:15.768 --> 1:06:17.336
Is there a computer?

1:06:18.170 --> 1:06:19.371
You can use mine.

1:06:22.608 --> 1:06:24.474
Where are your normal things?

1:06:24.476 --> 1:06:26.445
I don't really have
any things.

1:06:27.714 --> 1:06:29.247
Everything was just here.

1:06:35.688 --> 1:06:37.454
I'll show you
where you can sleep.

1:06:37.456 --> 1:06:39.857
Don't touch her!
Leave her alone!

1:06:39.859 --> 1:06:40.925
Anthony! Anthony, stop!

1:06:40.927 --> 1:06:42.727
Stay away from my family!

1:06:42.729 --> 1:06:44.327
- He's not gonna hurt us.
- Done.

1:06:44.329 --> 1:06:45.497
Anthony.

1:06:46.565 --> 1:06:48.298
Leave us alone.

1:06:48.300 --> 1:06:50.770
Leave us... Alone.

1:07:03.615 --> 1:07:05.916
Look, it's better
than sleeping

1:07:05.918 --> 1:07:08.251
under the piano.

1:07:24.804 --> 1:07:26.304
Are you cold?

1:07:28.808 --> 1:07:30.175
Sit here.

1:07:38.417 --> 1:07:40.787
You don't like it here,
do you?

1:07:42.989 --> 1:07:44.389
I like it.

1:07:49.896 --> 1:07:51.964
I just don't think
it's for me anymore.

1:08:00.272 --> 1:08:01.708
I'll be right back.

1:08:06.445 --> 1:08:07.577
Hello, Alice!

1:08:07.579 --> 1:08:08.713
Hi, Timofey.

1:08:08.715 --> 1:08:09.680
Can I take your coat?

1:08:09.682 --> 1:08:11.849
No, I've got my uniform on.
I mean, um...

1:08:11.851 --> 1:08:14.018
You don't have to
put on a Russian accent.

1:08:14.020 --> 1:08:16.553
I'm an ER nurse.
I've seen everything.

1:08:16.555 --> 1:08:20.457
Long day, short boyfriend.

1:08:20.459 --> 1:08:23.526
Yeah, this is Jude,
he's a patient at my hospital.

1:08:23.528 --> 1:08:25.395
I'm hoping that I might
find his mom here.

1:08:25.397 --> 1:08:29.599
Well, most of our guests
arrive quite late.

1:08:29.601 --> 1:08:32.803
This is a first-class restaurant
now, it's not Starbucks.

1:08:32.805 --> 1:08:34.537
I know, but Marc,
your manager,

1:08:34.539 --> 1:08:36.339
I talked to him earlier,
and I think

1:08:36.341 --> 1:08:38.475
she might be hiding here
with her other son.

1:08:38.477 --> 1:08:40.577
- She has two sons?
- Yeah.

1:08:40.579 --> 1:08:43.748
So the bigger one is not an only child?
That's a relief,

1:08:43.750 --> 1:08:45.582
because they can be
absolutely dreadful.

1:08:45.584 --> 1:08:46.684
So she's here.

1:08:46.686 --> 1:08:50.420
In confidence?
Try the top floor.

1:08:50.422 --> 1:08:51.588
You have to go
through the kitchen.

1:08:51.590 --> 1:08:52.923
Can you call her
and have her come down

1:08:52.925 --> 1:08:53.991
because I have to get back
to the hospital

1:08:53.993 --> 1:08:55.427
and discharge him?

1:08:56.561 --> 1:08:57.795
Okay.

1:08:57.797 --> 1:08:59.031
- Yeah? Thank you.
- Yeah.

1:09:06.105 --> 1:09:08.040
Would you like to, uh,

1:09:09.909 --> 1:09:11.443
see the menu?

1:09:16.515 --> 1:09:18.651
Would you like me
to find your mother?

1:09:34.867 --> 1:09:36.432
Oh! I'm sorry.

1:09:36.434 --> 1:09:37.433
Jeff.

1:09:37.435 --> 1:09:40.738
I was just...
I was just here...

1:09:40.740 --> 1:09:43.674
...in case
they came back.

1:09:43.676 --> 1:09:44.944
Keep a lookout.

1:09:46.012 --> 1:09:47.443
Is the kid all right?

1:09:47.445 --> 1:09:50.549
Yeah, he's okay.
I got him discharged.

1:09:52.551 --> 1:09:53.953
Is he with his mom?

1:09:54.486 --> 1:09:55.755
Yeah.

1:09:59.591 --> 1:10:00.893
Jeff, are you hungry?

1:10:04.030 --> 1:10:05.463
I could eat.

1:10:07.465 --> 1:10:09.869
Please say something.

1:10:12.805 --> 1:10:16.006
I know you don't wanna
talk to anyone.

1:10:16.008 --> 1:10:18.010
But maybe
you could talk to me.

1:10:35.661 --> 1:10:37.895
You know, my parents gave me
this wristwatch

1:10:37.897 --> 1:10:39.495
when I graduated.

1:10:39.497 --> 1:10:40.530
My dad was so proud

1:10:40.532 --> 1:10:43.067
he went and showed
everyone in the neighborhood.

1:10:43.069 --> 1:10:44.835
It's pretty.

1:10:44.837 --> 1:10:47.104
You need it for your job.

1:10:47.106 --> 1:10:49.041
Weren't you supposed to
work tonight?

1:10:49.942 --> 1:10:51.876
Would you like a vodka?

1:10:51.878 --> 1:10:55.145
I don't, uh...
I don't have any money.

1:10:55.147 --> 1:10:57.984
I'll get it. Can we have
two vodkas?

1:10:58.985 --> 1:11:01.517
Uh, sure. Russian Standard?

1:11:01.519 --> 1:11:03.754
Then I don't have to
go to the stock room.

1:11:03.756 --> 1:11:06.458
Sure. Make 'em doubles.

1:11:06.926 --> 1:11:07.925
Sure.

1:11:07.927 --> 1:11:10.194
You don't have anyone
you need to get home to?

1:11:10.196 --> 1:11:12.865
Well, not really, no.

1:11:13.598 --> 1:11:14.599
I...

1:11:18.170 --> 1:11:21.839
Six years ago, my parents died
within a year of each other

1:11:21.841 --> 1:11:25.009
and I'd moved out
to take care of them

1:11:25.011 --> 1:11:28.245
and took leave from the hospital.
When I came back,

1:11:28.247 --> 1:11:29.813
my boyfriend
had found someone new.

1:11:29.815 --> 1:11:31.449
Was he sleeping with her?

1:11:33.019 --> 1:11:34.186
Jeff...

1:11:36.588 --> 1:11:37.757
Sorry.

1:11:39.926 --> 1:11:42.059
So, um, what...

1:11:42.061 --> 1:11:43.461
Thank you.

1:11:44.196 --> 1:11:46.630
Well, what about...

1:11:46.632 --> 1:11:47.998
What about you then?

1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:51.637
I haven't been with anyone since.
Four years now.

1:11:56.809 --> 1:11:59.777
I thought people that had jobs
at hospitals had, you know,

1:11:59.779 --> 1:12:03.647
all kinds of things going on.
All those beds.

1:12:03.649 --> 1:12:06.549
Not in my hospital.

1:12:06.551 --> 1:12:07.954
I don't even know
if I'd remember how.

1:12:09.889 --> 1:12:11.190
Alice...

1:12:12.792 --> 1:12:16.026
I know I'm not your type of,
you know...

1:12:16.028 --> 1:12:17.962
Person or, you know,
whatever,

1:12:17.964 --> 1:12:20.831
and you're not really
my...

1:12:20.833 --> 1:12:23.233
I don't have a type, really.

1:12:23.235 --> 1:12:25.705
But you've been so kind to me,

1:12:26.672 --> 1:12:29.709
I'd be happy, you know...

1:12:31.277 --> 1:12:32.943
You know, to...

1:12:32.945 --> 1:12:36.013
Just once or twice,
you know, so you got the...

1:12:36.015 --> 1:12:39.615
So you found
your way back to it.

1:12:39.617 --> 1:12:43.320
An afternoon when the children's
orchestra is gone or something.

1:12:43.322 --> 1:12:46.724
Are you thinking
in the music room?

1:12:46.726 --> 1:12:48.027
On the piano?

1:12:50.262 --> 1:12:53.531
No, I thought we could put
some cushions on the floor.

1:12:54.834 --> 1:12:58.601
No, that's okay, but I...
Thank you, though.

1:12:58.603 --> 1:13:01.040
Yeah. It's the least
I can do.

1:13:12.584 --> 1:13:15.119
I'm not gonna
go to work tomorrow.

1:13:15.121 --> 1:13:16.854
How come?

1:13:16.856 --> 1:13:19.225
I'm just not good
with people anymore, Jeff.

1:13:22.862 --> 1:13:24.661
Yes, you are.

1:13:24.663 --> 1:13:26.330
The Forgiveness group,
you help those people.

1:13:29.035 --> 1:13:30.701
They help themselves.

1:13:30.703 --> 1:13:32.236
You're kind to them.

1:13:32.238 --> 1:13:34.006
You are kind to them.

1:13:36.075 --> 1:13:38.110
Even when they're not.

1:13:43.916 --> 1:13:46.519
I'm not someone people
get close to.

1:13:48.654 --> 1:13:50.856
I'm no one's <i>numero uno.</i>

1:13:54.794 --> 1:13:56.594
Is that Italian?

1:13:58.898 --> 1:14:00.666
Yeah.

1:14:04.804 --> 1:14:05.805
Bye.

1:14:30.296 --> 1:14:32.062
Hi.

1:14:32.064 --> 1:14:33.598
Hey.

1:14:36.035 --> 1:14:37.334
I thought you were sleeping.

1:14:37.336 --> 1:14:38.869
The boys are.

1:14:38.871 --> 1:14:40.005
How is Jude?

1:14:41.740 --> 1:14:43.209
The same.

1:14:44.376 --> 1:14:47.978
Anthony was
on your computer all day.

1:14:47.980 --> 1:14:48.981
Yeah.

1:14:52.218 --> 1:14:53.851
Would you like to go out?

1:14:53.853 --> 1:14:54.918
Now?

1:14:54.920 --> 1:14:57.323
Yeah. Just for a walk.

1:14:57.990 --> 1:14:59.723
Kids are safe.

1:14:59.725 --> 1:15:00.860
You must feel trapped in here.

1:15:02.828 --> 1:15:06.132
I can't.
Anthony gets nightmares.

1:15:06.765 --> 1:15:08.901
Besides, I like it in here.

1:15:11.036 --> 1:15:12.371
This isn't a prison.

1:15:13.806 --> 1:15:14.874
No, it's not.

1:15:17.977 --> 1:15:20.713
If we were going to go out,
where would we go?

1:15:22.448 --> 1:15:24.083
Where would you like to go?

1:15:26.118 --> 1:15:28.120
Hmm, not too far.

1:15:32.258 --> 1:15:35.926
I would take you quickly
to Canal Street.

1:15:35.928 --> 1:15:38.864
We would cross that,
and then we'd slow down.

1:15:41.033 --> 1:15:43.702
When we'd reached
West Village, I...

1:15:46.338 --> 1:15:50.073
I think I would have waited
so long for you to take my hand

1:15:50.075 --> 1:15:52.878
that I would try to take yours.

1:15:53.379 --> 1:15:54.947
Hmm.

1:16:08.093 --> 1:16:09.826
Forgiveness,
is that you?

1:16:09.828 --> 1:16:13.063
You know, it's not on today,
but, um...

1:16:13.065 --> 1:16:14.765
I have a leaflet here.

1:16:14.767 --> 1:16:16.200
I'm not looking
for forgiveness.

1:16:16.202 --> 1:16:19.469
I'm looking for my son.
Jude Brand?

1:16:19.471 --> 1:16:21.941
The hospital told me he's gone.
You're Alice, right?

1:16:25.077 --> 1:16:29.146
Uh, there's a children's
orchestra on Thursdays.

1:16:29.148 --> 1:16:30.149
My son doesn't play.

1:16:32.251 --> 1:16:34.453
I'm looking for my other son,
too, Anthony.

1:16:35.454 --> 1:16:36.889
And my wife.

1:16:37.856 --> 1:16:41.325
You work in that emergency
ward, don't you?

1:16:41.327 --> 1:16:44.161
They say his mom must have
picked him up. Did you see them?

1:16:44.163 --> 1:16:45.331
No.

1:16:47.066 --> 1:16:49.969
I mean... I don't know.
I don't know.

1:16:51.070 --> 1:16:52.903
I don't think
you should lie to me.

1:16:52.905 --> 1:16:54.206
Why would I lie?

1:16:54.641 --> 1:16:56.475
This is a church.

1:16:59.011 --> 1:17:00.544
Would you like me to call
the police for you?

1:17:00.546 --> 1:17:02.982
No, no, no, I don't think
you should.

1:17:05.217 --> 1:17:07.184
I love my wife.

1:17:07.186 --> 1:17:08.887
I love my sons.

1:17:10.522 --> 1:17:12.958
I don't think you understand
what love is.

1:17:14.393 --> 1:17:16.161
I don't think anybody
loves you.

1:17:31.243 --> 1:17:33.243
Okay, you're good.

1:17:33.245 --> 1:17:34.911
You want a mirror?

1:17:34.913 --> 1:17:36.146
No, I'm okay.

1:17:36.148 --> 1:17:38.915
- Good.
- Thanks.

1:17:38.917 --> 1:17:41.153
You want me
to cut your hair, too?

1:17:48.994 --> 1:17:50.060
Mom?

1:17:50.062 --> 1:17:52.296
Mmm-hmm?

1:17:52.298 --> 1:17:54.266
What will it take
for us to go home?

1:17:55.301 --> 1:17:57.134
That Dad goes to jail?

1:17:57.136 --> 1:17:59.436
I don't know.
I think so.

1:17:59.438 --> 1:18:02.439
When we were home,
I was on his computer

1:18:02.441 --> 1:18:04.207
and I saw some photos he had.

1:18:04.209 --> 1:18:06.310
Just leave it alone.
Read a book or something.

1:18:06.312 --> 1:18:09.546
Mom, it wasn't
just police photos.

1:18:09.548 --> 1:18:11.050
People being beat up.

1:18:12.217 --> 1:18:14.518
I've been trying
to find them.

1:18:14.520 --> 1:18:16.553
What are you talking about?
That's Marc's computer.

1:18:16.555 --> 1:18:19.089
It's not on here,
they're on Dad's computer.

1:18:19.091 --> 1:18:22.326
And, you know, I've been trying
to connect to Dad's computer

1:18:22.328 --> 1:18:25.262
but it won't let me,
so I can't show you.

1:18:25.264 --> 1:18:26.899
Like, I can't.

1:18:29.068 --> 1:18:30.302
It was horrible.

1:18:31.437 --> 1:18:34.106
I mean, torture and stuff.

1:18:35.407 --> 1:18:37.142
Like what he did to us.

1:20:10.737 --> 1:20:12.604
Do you know a lawyer?

1:20:16.074 --> 1:20:17.075
Yeah.

1:20:24.016 --> 1:20:26.349
- John Peter, Clara.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

1:20:26.351 --> 1:20:27.451
Hi.

1:20:27.453 --> 1:20:30.086
It's right through there.
I'll be right with you.

1:20:30.088 --> 1:20:31.356
Thanks.

1:20:32.157 --> 1:20:33.724
Far above your standard.

1:20:33.726 --> 1:20:36.326
- She's just a friend.
- You don't have any friends.

1:20:36.328 --> 1:20:39.797
Okay, I don't. What's that?

1:20:39.799 --> 1:20:42.199
- It's a chair.
- Really? Thank you.

1:20:42.201 --> 1:20:44.367
My assistant found it
on the street,

1:20:44.369 --> 1:20:47.070
and she insists I keep it 'til
she finds a boyfriend.

1:20:47.072 --> 1:20:48.505
She says it's retro.

1:20:48.507 --> 1:20:50.140
So you like her?

1:20:50.142 --> 1:20:53.713
She's 26 years old.
She thinks I'm retro, too.

1:20:54.747 --> 1:20:56.714
Plus I...

1:20:56.716 --> 1:20:58.584
May be falling
for someone else.

1:20:59.151 --> 1:21:00.651
Ah!

1:21:00.653 --> 1:21:02.621
- Someone I know?
- Yeah.

1:21:04.657 --> 1:21:06.624
Yeah, you'll leave us to it?

1:21:06.626 --> 1:21:08.124
Oh,

1:21:08.126 --> 1:21:09.528
I'll leave you to it.

1:21:10.730 --> 1:21:13.196
Um, have we met before?

1:21:13.198 --> 1:21:16.466
I don't think so.
I'm a friend of Marc's.

1:21:16.468 --> 1:21:18.003
Hmm.

1:21:19.304 --> 1:21:20.572
Have a seat.

1:21:25.310 --> 1:21:26.545
Well?

1:21:28.715 --> 1:21:30.683
So, um...

1:21:38.524 --> 1:21:39.792
Hello.

1:22:10.622 --> 1:22:12.659
Is there an...

1:22:21.433 --> 1:22:23.703
The Plaintiff shall be awarded...

1:22:33.545 --> 1:22:35.147
"His uncle came in..."

1:23:07.412 --> 1:23:08.779
Back in five.

1:23:08.781 --> 1:23:11.617
Yeah, Phil, just
give me a minute.

1:23:23.696 --> 1:23:26.598
There's a church she goes to.

1:23:27.466 --> 1:23:29.466
Leave a message.

1:23:29.468 --> 1:23:33.472
Tell her to come see you,
that she's forgiven.

1:23:35.607 --> 1:23:39.578
I can't stop that trial.
She's not gonna come see me.

1:23:40.512 --> 1:23:44.516
All she wants is money, okay?

1:23:47.285 --> 1:23:48.919
Please, Dad!

1:23:48.921 --> 1:23:51.554
I need to take care
of my sons.

1:23:51.556 --> 1:23:54.457
I need her to stop that lawyer.
It's gone too far.

1:23:54.459 --> 1:23:56.528
She has a soft spot for you.

1:23:58.330 --> 1:23:59.964
She's unreliable.

1:23:59.966 --> 1:24:01.832
She left home
when she was a kid

1:24:01.834 --> 1:24:03.868
and now she's leaving you.
She's flaky!

1:24:03.870 --> 1:24:05.435
She's not gonna win.

1:24:05.437 --> 1:24:06.639
Please, would you just do it?

1:24:09.809 --> 1:24:11.307
I don't...

1:24:11.309 --> 1:24:12.377
Oh!

1:24:13.478 --> 1:24:16.683
Ah! Ah! Stop!

1:24:18.583 --> 1:24:19.584
Ah!

1:24:35.768 --> 1:24:38.503
This time was not
quite as hopeless.

1:24:40.472 --> 1:24:41.540
See you next Thursday.

1:24:47.013 --> 1:24:48.346
It's nice.

1:24:49.381 --> 1:24:50.615
A little orchestra.

1:24:53.585 --> 1:24:54.654
Yeah, it's pretty nice.

1:24:59.025 --> 1:25:00.523
You wanna sit down?

1:25:00.525 --> 1:25:01.861
I'm not sure where to begin.

1:25:06.999 --> 1:25:09.033
You've been calling in sick
for weeks.

1:25:09.035 --> 1:25:11.468
I know. I'm so, so sorry.

1:25:11.470 --> 1:25:13.037
For the love of God,
I am a head nurse.

1:25:13.039 --> 1:25:14.372
You look just fine.

1:25:22.682 --> 1:25:24.650
Is this where the soup kitchen
is run from?

1:25:25.017 --> 1:25:26.018
Yeah.

1:25:27.019 --> 1:25:28.320
And the support group.

1:25:32.992 --> 1:25:34.859
Management asked me
to come find you.

1:25:34.861 --> 1:25:38.428
It's not just you.
The staff is worn out.

1:25:38.430 --> 1:25:40.465
They can't very well ask us
to turn patients away.

1:25:41.901 --> 1:25:43.568
Can I tell them
you'll be back next week?

1:25:47.073 --> 1:25:49.307
I don't think I can do
that job anymore.

1:25:49.909 --> 1:25:51.608
What will you live on?

1:25:51.610 --> 1:25:53.713
I don't know.
Soup.

1:25:54.747 --> 1:25:55.782
Sorry.

1:25:56.983 --> 1:25:59.919
Maybe I can ask the hospital

1:26:00.887 --> 1:26:02.287
to fund your group.

1:26:02.587 --> 1:26:03.788
Really?

1:26:03.790 --> 1:26:06.422
People are grateful, I hear.

1:26:06.424 --> 1:26:09.026
Except the ones who complain
there's a waiting list.

1:26:09.028 --> 1:26:10.527
There's a waiting list?

1:26:10.529 --> 1:26:11.563
Yes.

1:26:14.566 --> 1:26:15.567
Um...

1:26:17.536 --> 1:26:19.806
Well, will you
put in a good word?

1:26:21.941 --> 1:26:23.341
I'll try.

1:26:23.843 --> 1:26:25.011
Thank you.

1:26:39.558 --> 1:26:40.960
- Goodnight, Jack.
- Goodnight.

1:26:57.977 --> 1:26:59.143
Are you busy?

1:26:59.145 --> 1:27:00.545
No, no. Not at all.

1:27:02.748 --> 1:27:03.883
The boys are asleep?

1:27:05.483 --> 1:27:06.784
Mmm-hmm.

1:27:06.786 --> 1:27:08.087
Have you heard
from John Peter?

1:27:10.156 --> 1:27:11.691
It turns out,

1:27:13.491 --> 1:27:16.526
someone found my father-in-law
lying on the floor

1:27:16.528 --> 1:27:17.697
of his apartment.

1:27:18.197 --> 1:27:19.564
His girlfriend...

1:27:20.933 --> 1:27:22.534
She got him to a hospital.

1:27:25.604 --> 1:27:27.640
They think my husband
beat him up,

1:27:28.674 --> 1:27:29.775
so...

1:27:31.777 --> 1:27:35.047
Now they're offering the boys
and me a place to stay.

1:27:36.782 --> 1:27:39.449
So, you're moving?

1:27:39.451 --> 1:27:40.516
Tomorrow.

1:27:40.518 --> 1:27:43.155
We can't go home until after
the case is settled.

1:27:44.857 --> 1:27:46.626
Will you be staying
in the city?

1:27:48.560 --> 1:27:49.693
I don't know.

1:27:49.695 --> 1:27:52.397
They won't tell us the address.
It's confidential.

1:28:26.866 --> 1:28:28.600
I have to take care
of my boys.

1:28:43.149 --> 1:28:44.482
Follow me.

1:28:55.861 --> 1:28:56.963
Thank you.

1:29:11.711 --> 1:29:14.577
Why have you put small spoons
on every single place setting?

1:29:14.579 --> 1:29:16.146
Did you do that in kindergarten

1:29:16.148 --> 1:29:19.151
or are you trying to force
people to order caviar?

1:29:19.885 --> 1:29:23.754
Don't you see
how rude that is?

1:29:23.756 --> 1:29:25.889
Don't you think people should
have a chance to decide

1:29:25.891 --> 1:29:26.892
for themselves?

1:29:41.107 --> 1:29:42.108
Sorry.

1:29:45.111 --> 1:29:48.045
It's completely up to you
if you want people

1:29:48.047 --> 1:29:49.882
to have spoons or not.

1:29:50.615 --> 1:29:51.682
I'm sorry.

1:29:51.684 --> 1:29:56.053
Yeah, no, you, you, you may
have a point there.

1:29:56.055 --> 1:30:01.058
It's actually a little tactless
to just assume without...

1:30:01.060 --> 1:30:03.627
I should have seen that.
Don't I have eyes in my head?

1:30:03.629 --> 1:30:05.898
Look, I'm, I'm,
I'm the one who's sorry.

1:30:09.135 --> 1:30:11.170
I'm grateful for what you do
at this place.

1:30:12.104 --> 1:30:13.637
It's going great.

1:30:13.639 --> 1:30:15.939
Again, I prefer
not to discuss anything

1:30:15.941 --> 1:30:18.275
that has to do with business.

1:30:18.277 --> 1:30:21.113
But I have been more worried
than I realized about...

1:30:23.049 --> 1:30:25.684
...not being able
to keep the place.

1:30:27.820 --> 1:30:30.788
It shouldn't be
a problemovich.

1:30:36.195 --> 1:30:37.897
Will she be coming back?

1:30:40.800 --> 1:30:41.934
I don't think so.

1:30:45.004 --> 1:30:46.005
Goodnight.

1:30:47.873 --> 1:30:49.108
Can you ask her to?

1:30:50.943 --> 1:30:53.611
And the kind little boys?

1:30:55.414 --> 1:30:57.083
I don't even know
where they are.

1:31:17.236 --> 1:31:19.038
Do you wanna
sleep in my bed?

1:31:20.739 --> 1:31:22.041
It's not your bed.

1:31:24.143 --> 1:31:25.911
No, it's not.

1:31:28.881 --> 1:31:30.182
You're nothing like him.

1:31:32.017 --> 1:31:33.219
Neither is Jude.

1:31:35.254 --> 1:31:38.623
Neither of you
have anything bad in you.

1:31:39.725 --> 1:31:41.026
I want to kill him.

1:31:43.429 --> 1:31:46.365
If we win this,
he's gonna go to jail,

1:31:48.267 --> 1:31:51.068
I think,
for a very long time.

1:31:51.070 --> 1:31:53.706
You're gonna grow up
and you'll forget him.

1:31:54.240 --> 1:31:55.841
But what if he wins?

1:31:59.245 --> 1:32:01.778
I had no idea
how much we owed.

1:32:01.780 --> 1:32:03.983
I just put all the bills
in my bowling bag.

1:32:04.750 --> 1:32:06.950
Huh. And my wife
loves shopping.

1:32:06.952 --> 1:32:09.386
I mean, I think we had
100 tea pots in my home

1:32:09.388 --> 1:32:11.090
and we mostly just drink coffee.

1:32:12.057 --> 1:32:13.123
Uh, she even bought one

1:32:13.125 --> 1:32:14.892
that was made to look like
Saint Peter's Cathedral.

1:32:14.894 --> 1:32:16.360
Can we stay on topic?

1:32:16.362 --> 1:32:17.663
We've got one like that.

1:32:18.731 --> 1:32:20.199
Can we stay on topic, please?

1:32:21.100 --> 1:32:23.200
Right. Uh...

1:32:23.202 --> 1:32:25.169
I think I'll forgive myself
next Tuesday.

1:32:25.171 --> 1:32:27.006
Yeah, you said
that last Tuesday.

1:32:27.840 --> 1:32:28.874
Who's next?

1:32:33.078 --> 1:32:34.213
John Peter...

1:32:35.214 --> 1:32:36.813
You hardly ever speak.

1:32:36.815 --> 1:32:39.883
I'm an attorney.
I'm sworn to confidentiality.

1:32:39.885 --> 1:32:41.218
Not about yourself.

1:32:41.220 --> 1:32:42.421
I have no problems.

1:32:43.222 --> 1:32:46.023
Not enough sex, but...

1:32:46.025 --> 1:32:48.158
I assume everyone else in this
room shares the same problem.

1:32:48.160 --> 1:32:49.293
Speak for yourself.

1:32:49.295 --> 1:32:53.096
Yeah, Bonnie,
I'm sure you're on fire in bed.

1:32:53.098 --> 1:32:55.098
Well, still waters can run deep.

1:32:55.100 --> 1:32:57.236
Very deep, Lloyd.

1:32:58.137 --> 1:32:59.772
Why can't you just be kind?

1:33:01.240 --> 1:33:02.539
Terrible things happen,

1:33:02.541 --> 1:33:04.710
and some of you
have nobody to turn to.

1:33:05.444 --> 1:33:06.745
But you have strangers.

1:33:08.147 --> 1:33:09.982
Why can't you be
more careful?

1:33:11.317 --> 1:33:12.418
More compassionate.

1:33:13.986 --> 1:33:15.219
And you two,

1:33:15.221 --> 1:33:18.288
you sit there and you don't
talk and you take up space.

1:33:18.290 --> 1:33:21.391
Well, not you, John Peter.
You've actually been...

1:33:21.393 --> 1:33:23.295
You've been terrific.
You've been very kind.

1:33:24.530 --> 1:33:25.864
But the rest of you...

1:33:28.100 --> 1:33:30.035
What gives you the right
to be unkind?

1:33:34.073 --> 1:33:35.138
Shut up, Bonnie.

1:33:35.140 --> 1:33:36.175
What?

1:33:44.183 --> 1:33:45.985
That was so helpful!

1:33:51.991 --> 1:33:53.759
John Peter and Marc,
could you stay?

1:33:58.831 --> 1:34:00.297
Firstly, forgive me.

1:34:00.299 --> 1:34:01.531
- Of course.
- Absolutely.

1:34:01.533 --> 1:34:03.166
There's a waiting list
for the group,

1:34:03.168 --> 1:34:06.003
and I hope we're moving
to the hospital.

1:34:06.005 --> 1:34:08.572
So I think you guys
should stop coming.

1:34:08.574 --> 1:34:09.942
Oh. Well...

1:34:10.576 --> 1:34:12.075
I'm only here for his sake.

1:34:12.077 --> 1:34:14.113
I'm only here for his sake
and for you.

1:34:16.215 --> 1:34:17.216
Um...

1:34:19.118 --> 1:34:20.119
Ah.

1:34:21.053 --> 1:34:22.886
I'm gonna go for a smoke.

1:34:22.888 --> 1:34:23.989
Good.

1:34:30.062 --> 1:34:31.563
In that case, um...

1:34:33.932 --> 1:34:35.999
Are you free to come here
on Sunday night?

1:34:36.001 --> 1:34:39.036
Yes, I am.
Um, any special reason?

1:34:39.038 --> 1:34:43.073
No special reason, just now
you're not my client anymore.

1:34:43.075 --> 1:34:44.810
Um, I can invite you to dinner.

1:34:45.944 --> 1:34:47.246
Rock and roll.

1:34:49.281 --> 1:34:51.450
That's the first time I've
ever used that expression.

1:35:14.039 --> 1:35:15.207
Whoo!

1:35:36.929 --> 1:35:38.163
Will Alice be there?

1:35:39.198 --> 1:35:41.133
Yes, it was her idea.

1:35:42.368 --> 1:35:44.036
And she is going to cook
for us.

1:35:45.672 --> 1:35:47.039
Will Marc?

1:35:48.340 --> 1:35:49.541
No.

1:35:54.113 --> 1:35:55.314
Come on,
you'll sit over here.

1:35:57.416 --> 1:35:59.616
Thank you so much
for having us.

1:35:59.618 --> 1:36:01.385
The boys were so excited.

1:36:01.387 --> 1:36:04.354
I'm so glad that you came.
Nice to see you.

1:36:04.356 --> 1:36:06.657
When everyone is seated,
I'll get some chairs.

1:36:06.659 --> 1:36:07.958
Okay.

1:36:07.960 --> 1:36:09.261
They're a little wet, though.

1:36:09.995 --> 1:36:11.662
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:36:11.664 --> 1:36:13.964
- Oh!
- It's just,

1:36:13.966 --> 1:36:15.265
yeah, I'll...

1:36:17.670 --> 1:36:20.203
Oh, hi.
Have you heard anything?

1:36:20.205 --> 1:36:22.673
No, I'm sorry.
No word yet.

1:36:22.675 --> 1:36:23.775
- No word?
- I'm sorry.

1:36:23.777 --> 1:36:26.376
- You all right, Jeff?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1:36:26.378 --> 1:36:27.946
- Say hi to John Peter.
- Ah!

1:36:28.547 --> 1:36:30.113
Hi. How are you?

1:36:30.115 --> 1:36:34.184
So, uh, Jeff
has been cooking all day

1:36:34.186 --> 1:36:36.386
and it looks
incredibly delicious.

1:36:36.388 --> 1:36:37.454
It looks great.

1:36:37.456 --> 1:36:39.156
Which corner,
which corner, which corner?

1:36:39.158 --> 1:36:40.590
Any.

1:36:40.592 --> 1:36:45.529
Okay. This one. This got...
This got good potato.

1:36:45.531 --> 1:36:47.132
I've got it, Jeff. I've got it.

1:36:50.169 --> 1:36:51.236
Mmm-mmm.

1:36:53.105 --> 1:36:55.338
- Uh...
- What's wrong?

1:36:55.340 --> 1:36:57.407
Forgive me
for being a bit

1:36:57.409 --> 1:37:00.177
gauche, but, uh...

1:37:00.179 --> 1:37:02.579
In case we need to eat
someplace else, um,

1:37:02.581 --> 1:37:04.514
I know a place.

1:37:04.516 --> 1:37:05.584
That would be great.

1:37:06.786 --> 1:37:08.686
Beautiful, Marc.
Beautiful work.

1:37:08.688 --> 1:37:11.087
You found a way to make
Russian food delicious.

1:37:11.089 --> 1:37:13.624
This Prince Igor salad,

1:37:13.626 --> 1:37:17.227
is this what Brezhnev ate in
the '80s, the early '80s?

1:37:17.229 --> 1:37:18.395
Shut up. It was delicious.

1:37:18.397 --> 1:37:19.362
I like the caviar.

1:37:19.364 --> 1:37:21.398
Oh, guys, it can be
Brezhnev's favorite meal

1:37:21.400 --> 1:37:23.335
and still be delicious.
That was wonderful.

1:37:24.771 --> 1:37:25.770
Anthony, have some more.

1:37:25.772 --> 1:37:29.807
Maybe later. Jeff,
can we get some ice cream?

1:37:29.809 --> 1:37:33.410
Yeah. You want me to go get
it, though? Unless you want to.

1:37:33.412 --> 1:37:36.546
Why don't you hang out,
hang out if you want.

1:37:36.548 --> 1:37:39.017
I mean, you worked
a long day today,

1:37:39.686 --> 1:37:41.418
and...

1:37:41.420 --> 1:37:43.186
I got kicked out
of my therapy group

1:37:43.188 --> 1:37:46.492
so I could, uh, I could use
someone to chat with.

1:37:48.695 --> 1:37:51.161
So when
is your case decided?

1:37:51.163 --> 1:37:53.465
Uh, next week, they think.

1:37:54.600 --> 1:37:56.401
If it goes well, we can go home.

1:37:57.402 --> 1:37:59.236
John Peter's been amazing.

1:37:59.238 --> 1:38:00.405
Oh, yes, he is.

1:38:01.373 --> 1:38:02.572
The day he won my case,

1:38:02.574 --> 1:38:05.609
I wanted to take him to dinner,
so we came to this place.

1:38:05.611 --> 1:38:07.244
The investors
happened to be here.

1:38:07.246 --> 1:38:10.717
We drank all night, and the
next day I had the job.

1:38:20.492 --> 1:38:22.125
It's the concert hall.

1:38:22.127 --> 1:38:23.328
Mmm.

1:38:30.302 --> 1:38:31.603
I like this place.

1:38:34.206 --> 1:38:35.541
And I like you.

1:38:38.210 --> 1:38:40.212
It's gonna be hard to say
goodbye to you again.

1:38:43.282 --> 1:38:44.449
I think we should do it now.

1:38:50.657 --> 1:38:51.824
Goodbye.

1:38:52.558 --> 1:38:53.559
Goodbye.

1:39:45.778 --> 1:39:47.179
Come, sit down.

1:39:52.250 --> 1:39:54.551
Uh, we won.

1:39:54.553 --> 1:39:57.122
Your husband is going away
for a very long time.

1:39:58.490 --> 1:40:00.760
You're safe now, it's over.
You can go home.

1:40:01.526 --> 1:40:02.729
You can go anywhere.

1:40:14.841 --> 1:40:16.941
How am I ever
gonna thank you?

1:40:16.943 --> 1:40:19.209
Oh, I intend to bill you

1:40:19.211 --> 1:40:20.711
substantially.

1:40:20.713 --> 1:40:22.713
I have a girlfriend now
who eats caviar

1:40:22.715 --> 1:40:24.851
the way the rest of us
eat frosted flakes.

1:40:26.218 --> 1:40:27.486
- Alice?
- Yeah.

1:40:28.788 --> 1:40:30.188
She's a monster.

1:41:17.937 --> 1:41:19.704
Where's Dad's computer?

1:41:19.706 --> 1:41:20.907
They confiscated it.

1:41:55.742 --> 1:41:57.476
I'd like to change schools

1:41:58.911 --> 1:42:00.680
where they don't know me
and Jude.

1:42:01.580 --> 1:42:02.715
We could move.

1:42:03.582 --> 1:42:04.949
To the city.

1:42:04.951 --> 1:42:07.252
We could live
close to the library.

1:42:08.688 --> 1:42:10.823
It would have to be a really
small apartment.

1:42:12.557 --> 1:42:13.960
That doesn't matter to me.

1:42:16.328 --> 1:42:17.730
We could sell the car, then.

1:42:20.532 --> 1:42:22.334
We could get you a computer.

1:42:24.402 --> 1:42:27.039
If you wanted, we could get
one of those really big ones.

1:42:28.540 --> 1:42:30.473
With a box under the desk.

1:42:31.778 --> 1:42:34.410
Just a small one is fine,
thanks, Mom.

1:42:34.412 --> 1:42:35.915
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1:42:47.526 --> 1:42:49.896
We should probably
stay here, though, for Jude.

1:42:53.431 --> 1:42:54.634
It'd be better for him.

1:42:56.836 --> 1:42:57.970
Mom?

1:42:58.771 --> 1:43:00.570
Yeah?

1:43:00.572 --> 1:43:02.541
When Dad said
I had to hit Jude...

1:43:03.976 --> 1:43:05.643
Yeah?

1:43:05.645 --> 1:43:07.747
Jude said he could see
why I did it.

1:43:10.049 --> 1:43:12.819
He'd have done the same thing
if he'd been the older brother.

1:43:16.989 --> 1:43:18.557
So he forgave me.

1:43:22.862 --> 1:43:24.831
So you should forgive
yourself, too.

1:43:39.679 --> 1:43:40.813
Mom?

1:43:44.482 --> 1:43:45.751
We should move.

1:44:00.900 --> 1:44:03.401
I can call you back
at six o'clock.

1:44:04.070 --> 1:44:05.403
All right, bye.

1:44:06.839 --> 1:44:08.571
Hi, everyone. I'm Alice.

1:44:08.573 --> 1:44:10.573
Forgiveness is this way.
Just follow me.

1:44:10.575 --> 1:44:12.845
Bonnie, will you introduce
everyone?

1:44:14.613 --> 1:44:17.884
And I'm Bonnie.
Peter. That's Marcus.

1:44:18.483 --> 1:44:22.054
Carol. Jonathan. Sita. JJ.

1:44:23.588 --> 1:44:25.423
Carrie. Ola.

1:44:29.695 --> 1:44:30.997
Your receipt is in the bag.

1:44:33.733 --> 1:44:35.067
Thank you.

1:44:44.944 --> 1:44:46.779
Thank you very much.

1:44:47.479 --> 1:44:49.046
Thank you.

1:44:49.048 --> 1:44:50.615
<i>Na zdorovye.</i>

1:44:51.050 --> 1:44:52.184
<i>Na zdorovye.</i>

1:44:57.256 --> 1:44:59.125
<i>Spasiba.</i> Thank you.

1:45:00.826 --> 1:45:02.695
- Take care of the place.
- I will.

1:45:18.610 --> 1:45:19.679
Clara...

1:45:36.862 --> 1:45:38.563
I owe you a lot of money

1:45:39.732 --> 1:45:41.801
for rent and everything else.

1:45:42.835 --> 1:45:44.068
I can pay you now.

1:45:44.070 --> 1:45:45.204
No, you don't have to.

1:45:46.571 --> 1:45:48.074
Things are going
very well here.

1:45:49.141 --> 1:45:50.643
We hired a new doorman.

1:45:51.677 --> 1:45:52.876
Jeff.

1:45:54.546 --> 1:45:56.716
He's not helping
people park, is he?

1:45:58.217 --> 1:45:59.218
Good.

1:46:00.786 --> 1:46:01.988
Are the boys at school?

1:46:04.156 --> 1:46:05.891
Not far from here, actually.

1:46:23.709 --> 1:46:24.877
It's for you.

1:46:25.344 --> 1:46:27.911
Thanks.

1:46:27.913 --> 1:46:30.647
You're not very good at
getting presents, are you?

1:46:30.649 --> 1:46:31.751
Usually, no.

1:46:34.353 --> 1:46:35.654
What is it?

1:46:36.088 --> 1:46:37.289
Swimming trunks.

1:46:39.191 --> 1:46:40.993
I thought we could go
to the beach.

1:46:42.728 --> 1:46:44.128
Now?

1:46:44.130 --> 1:46:45.197
At some point.

1:46:48.200 --> 1:46:49.635
Give me ten minutes.

1:47:26.372 --> 1:47:29.206
If you could just
stand out there, you know,

1:47:29.208 --> 1:47:31.742
you'll get the hang of it
in no time.

1:47:31.744 --> 1:47:34.178
Should I help people in
and out of the taxis?

1:47:34.180 --> 1:47:36.180
No, they can do that
for themselves.

1:47:36.182 --> 1:47:38.248
Should I say hello to them?

1:47:38.250 --> 1:47:40.050
No, they can do that
for themselves, too.

1:47:40.052 --> 1:47:41.318
I mean, if they insist,

1:47:41.320 --> 1:47:43.887
you speak
with a Russian accent, okay?

1:47:43.889 --> 1:47:44.990
<i>Rushklenov.</i>

1:47:46.759 --> 1:47:47.927
That sort of thing, yeah.

1:47:49.328 --> 1:47:50.863
You want me to play this?

1:47:54.667 --> 1:47:55.935
Could you if you had to?

1:47:57.803 --> 1:47:59.069
Sure.

1:47:59.071 --> 1:48:01.006
Okay. Give it a shot.
