(sighs)

01:29.894 --> 01:31.227
What in the hell is that?

01:31.295 --> 01:33.663
- My zucchini casserole.
- Zucchini?

01:33.731 --> 01:36.733
(chuckles) Excuse me, but
this is not Italian squash.

01:36.801 --> 01:39.235
Yeah, the only thing Italian
about this situation

01:39.303 --> 01:40.537
is your dirty lies!

01:41.739 --> 01:44.374
(inhales, exhales)

01:44.442 --> 01:46.609
You're right--
it's not zucchini,

01:46.677 --> 01:48.144
it's okra.

01:48.212 --> 01:50.180
I guess when I
was at the store,

01:50.247 --> 01:51.581
my mind was
somewhere else.

01:51.649 --> 01:53.149
See, sometimes I escape

01:53.217 --> 01:55.068
to a little place
in my head

01:55.136 --> 01:57.954
where no one complains
about the meals I cook.

01:58.022 --> 02:00.457
(gasping)

02:00.524 --> 02:04.027
And there's no more scraping snot
rockets off the shower tiles.

02:05.329 --> 02:08.298
And no more PB&J
with the crusts cut off.

02:08.365 --> 02:11.000
(bones crack)

02:11.068 --> 02:13.403
Anyway, if you
don't want to eat it,

02:13.471 --> 02:15.905
I can fix something else.

02:15.973 --> 02:18.508
Okra's great!
Yum!

02:18.576 --> 02:19.776
Well, I'm not eating it.

02:19.844 --> 02:21.344
Okra gives me pretty bad gas.

02:21.412 --> 02:22.212
Just eat it.

02:22.279 --> 02:23.513
Okay.

02:23.581 --> 02:25.849
But don't complain
if I get pretty bad gas.

02:25.916 --> 02:28.151
(smoke alarm beeping)

02:28.219 --> 02:30.987
(coughing)

02:31.055 --> 02:32.455
Stan!
(coughing)

02:32.523 --> 02:34.157
The house must
be on fire!

02:34.225 --> 02:36.409
(all coughing)

02:36.477 --> 02:37.911
I don't see any flames.

02:37.978 --> 02:39.362
Then what is it?!

02:39.430 --> 02:40.463
(beeping continues)

02:40.531 --> 02:41.798
(groans)
Who farted?

02:41.866 --> 02:43.199
This guy!

02:43.267 --> 02:46.703
(farting)

02:50.253 --> 02:52.779
Well, whatever's in there
is off-the-charts toxic.

02:53.081 --> 02:55.850
It's gonna take at least a
week to sanitize your house.

02:55.854 --> 02:56.954
A week?!

02:57.122 --> 02:59.123
Where are we supposed
to go for a week?

02:59.190 --> 03:00.791
Relax. Just leave it to me.

03:05.207 --> 03:07.676
Okay, I got us free rooms
for the whole week.

03:07.718 --> 03:10.352
How'd you do that?
I stayed here back in the '80s

03:10.420 --> 03:11.954
and suffered
a terrible accident.

03:12.022 --> 03:15.391
To avoid a lawsuit, the hotel gave me
a free week of rooms.

03:15.459 --> 03:17.693
Honestly, I forgot about
the whole thing until today.

03:17.761 --> 03:19.729
That fart really shook
some memories loose.

03:19.796 --> 03:22.598
Wow, I just remembered,
I was also in a legal battle

03:22.666 --> 03:23.999
with Nabisco.

03:24.067 --> 03:27.002
I claimed I was Asian
and sued over Cheese Nips.

03:27.070 --> 03:28.637
Anyway, everything's
complimentary--

03:28.705 --> 03:30.940
room service, laundry, you name it.
You hear that, honey?

03:31.007 --> 03:33.609
A whole week without you
having to take care of us.

03:33.677 --> 03:35.745
Wow! Finally
some me time.

03:35.812 --> 03:38.314
Stan and Francine,
here are keys to <i>your</i> room.

03:38.381 --> 03:39.648
And, Steve,
here's yours.

03:39.716 --> 03:40.783
What about
my room?

03:40.851 --> 03:41.884
Got you covered.

03:44.521 --> 03:46.622

Bewitching,
isn't she?

04:18.288 --> 04:19.721
I know you.

04:19.790 --> 04:22.291
Weren't you the concierge
in <i>Pretty Woman?</i>

04:22.359 --> 04:24.527
(chuckles)
Yes. I'm Hector Elizondo.

04:24.594 --> 04:28.464
I've played a concierge in
over 400 movies and TV pilots.

04:28.532 --> 04:32.067
Acting pays the bills
so I can pursue my true passion:

04:32.135 --> 04:34.570
concierging.

04:34.638 --> 04:37.273
I don't mean to ignore
your strange monologue, but...

04:37.340 --> 04:39.809
I can't take my eyes
off this enchanting vision.

04:39.876 --> 04:43.646
The moment I saw her,
I felt as I'd... met her before.

04:43.713 --> 04:46.816
Impossible. The great artist
Patrick Nagel painted her

04:46.883 --> 04:48.684
while staying
in this hotel...

04:48.752 --> 04:50.419
in 1981.

04:50.487 --> 04:52.521
Then I'm too late
to meet her.

04:52.589 --> 04:55.024
God! If it were
only 1981 again!

04:55.091 --> 04:58.828
Well, young man...
perhaps it can be.

05:00.163 --> 05:02.698
Excuse me, where can
I get some tampons?

05:02.766 --> 05:04.066
Right over here, miss.

05:04.134 --> 05:06.268
I keep them next to my Tony.

05:13.143 --> 05:16.645
Huh. No breakfast to make,
no clothes to wash.

05:16.713 --> 05:19.448
I guess I can do
whatever I want.

05:27.624 --> 05:28.991
What are you doing?

05:29.059 --> 05:31.193
Laying out your
clothes for the day.

05:31.261 --> 05:32.995
Honey, stop worrying about us.

05:33.063 --> 05:35.798
Go spend time with Francine,
get to know her.

05:35.866 --> 05:38.200

I always wish <i>I'd</i> done.

05:38.268 --> 05:40.336
A-Are you sure?

05:40.403 --> 05:43.105
(laughs)
I'm pretty sure
I can dress myself.

05:43.173 --> 05:44.607
Uh, o-okay.

05:44.674 --> 05:46.575
I'll just...

05:46.643 --> 05:49.111
get to know me.

05:49.179 --> 05:50.813
(door closes)

05:50.881 --> 05:52.414

go with the suit,

No, but I hear she's finally coming

I just heard she was in an
accident on her way here.

06:31.621 --> 06:33.622
Car went over a cliff
and into a river.

06:33.690 --> 06:35.891

She's presumed dead.

06:35.959 --> 06:37.927

06:37.994 --> 06:39.728

06:39.796 --> 06:42.064

she's probably dead.

06:44.868 --> 06:47.202

You do?

06:47.270 --> 06:49.071
There's only one name tag left.

Please, God,
not you...

07:10.260 --> 07:11.894
not you...
not you...

07:15.973 --> 07:18.275
So, welcome everyone, and, uh,

07:18.342 --> 07:20.577
let's make this
concrete sellers convention

07:20.645 --> 07:23.046
the most solid one ever.

07:23.114 --> 07:24.747

Oh...!

07:33.925 --> 07:36.393
<i>Bakersfield</i> Pam!

07:36.460 --> 07:39.563
You know, Sarah, there's
a rumor that you died in a

07:39.630 --> 07:41.031
(whispers): car crash.

07:41.098 --> 07:43.099
(laughing): A what?

07:43.167 --> 07:44.801
Oh, my, no!

07:44.869 --> 07:47.370
I was just <i>dying</i>
to be here!

07:47.438 --> 07:49.773

If you're like me,

07:49.840 --> 07:52.642
you were dying to get away
from your family for a week.

07:52.710 --> 07:54.511
Actually, I...

07:54.579 --> 07:56.546
don't have a family.

07:56.614 --> 08:00.050
Nope. My life is all about me.

Horseback riding
and hang gliding

08:03.287 --> 08:04.788
and, um...

08:04.855 --> 08:07.591
having sex with some of
Chicago's many Polacks.

Hi, Sarah.
Pete Pendelman,

08:11.228 --> 08:12.896
concrete man
out of Pheboygan.

08:12.963 --> 08:14.247
Let's walk and talk.

08:14.315 --> 08:15.882
What are you doing?

08:15.950 --> 08:18.852
What? On a whim, I decided
to be a saleswoman

08:18.920 --> 08:20.887
who didn't show
up-- big deal.

08:20.955 --> 08:23.657
No, I-I get it-- you need
a little escape from Francine.

08:23.724 --> 08:25.942
We are gonna have
so much fun this week!

08:26.010 --> 08:29.312
Yeah. We'll mingle,
go to cocktail mixers...

08:29.380 --> 08:32.015
Oh, no-- Pete Pendelman
is a recovering alcoholic.

08:32.082 --> 08:34.851
I started hitting the bottle
after my wife died...

08:34.919 --> 08:38.054
during breast reduction surgery
that I made her get.

08:38.121 --> 08:40.490
(choked up):
She was pregnant at the time!

08:40.558 --> 08:42.359
Anyway, we're
gonna have a blast--

08:42.426 --> 08:45.161
as long as the real
Sarah Blanch doesn't show up.

08:45.229 --> 08:47.597
Oh, don't worry--
Sarah Blanch is dead.

08:53.521 --> 08:54.721
(gasps)

08:54.805 --> 08:57.107
(laughing)

08:57.174 --> 08:58.508
(thud)

09:00.911 --> 09:02.846
Stop torturing
yourself, Steve.

09:02.913 --> 09:04.414
You'll never
have her...

09:04.482 --> 09:06.249
unless you believe in...

09:06.317 --> 09:07.851
time travel!

09:09.987 --> 09:11.321
What?

09:11.389 --> 09:13.623
Oh, sorry,
wrong brochure.

09:13.691 --> 09:16.192
Whoa! This claims you
could travel back in time

09:16.260 --> 09:17.894
using only your mind!

09:17.962 --> 09:19.629
Do you know
what this means?

09:19.697 --> 09:22.666
Yes. You can go back in
time, watch me be born,

09:22.733 --> 09:25.335
and be the first
person to hold me.

09:25.403 --> 09:26.870
Just kidding!

09:26.937 --> 09:29.773
Go back to 1981 and
get your dream girl!

09:29.840 --> 09:32.375
Thanks, Hector!

09:32.443 --> 09:36.146
Who will hug baby Hector?

09:39.917 --> 09:41.251
You tap-dance, too?

09:41.318 --> 09:42.485
Wow, Sarah!

09:42.553 --> 09:44.254
How many hobbies
do you have?

09:44.321 --> 09:45.288
Five.

09:45.356 --> 09:46.589
Wow!
Five?

09:46.657 --> 09:47.957
Pete, you've been quiet.

09:48.025 --> 09:49.459
What about your family?
You married?

09:51.062 --> 09:55.532
Two years ago my wife was killed
by a plastic surgeon in Ecuador.

09:55.599 --> 09:57.233
I found him on Yelp.

09:57.301 --> 09:59.035
I gave him two stars.

09:59.103 --> 10:02.939
Her breasts looked amazing
during the open-casket.

10:03.007 --> 10:05.809
So I... <i>was</i> married.

10:07.478 --> 10:10.113
(clears throat)

10:10.181 --> 10:11.681
(beep)

10:14.051 --> 10:15.051
(sighs)

10:15.119 --> 10:17.120
Looks like Sarah's
day is over.

10:17.188 --> 10:18.204
Aw...
Aw...

10:18.272 --> 10:19.823
Excuse me, Miss Blanch.

10:19.890 --> 10:24.027
We show you still haven't checked
into your executive suite.

10:26.697 --> 10:28.298
Whoa!

10:28.365 --> 10:31.267
A complimentary
bucket of Coronas?!

10:31.335 --> 10:33.603
Sarah must be
super important!

10:35.956 --> 10:38.508
Hey, let's order huge
sundaes from room service

10:38.576 --> 10:40.410
and just pig out!

10:40.478 --> 10:43.246
Oh, no sweets for Pete--
I have stage two diabetes.

10:43.314 --> 10:44.414
In fact...

10:44.482 --> 10:45.648
