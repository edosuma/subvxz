00:03.586 --> 00:05.963
You said you'd marry Joey?

00:06.131 --> 00:09.633
Okay, you have to realize,
I was exhausted, I was emotional.

00:09.801 --> 00:11.552
I would have said yes to anybody.

00:11.720 --> 00:14.680
Like that time
when you and I got married.

00:16.641 --> 00:18.600
I'm not helping.

00:19.060 --> 00:23.355
So you said yes to him,
and you just had our baby?

00:23.523 --> 00:27.776
That is right. And traditionally,
the daddy gives the mommy a present.

00:27.944 --> 00:29.903
But I am prepared to let that go.

00:31.072 --> 00:34.908
So when I came here to see if you
wanted to maybe start things up again...

00:35.076 --> 00:38.412
...you were engaged to my best friend?

00:38.580 --> 00:39.913
Well...

00:40.081 --> 00:41.832
Really?

00:42.083 --> 00:44.626
I thought Chandler
was your best friend.

00:44.794 --> 00:46.670
- Well, Chandler's my oldest friend.
- Mm-hm.

00:46.838 --> 00:49.423
- Joey's my... No! Uh-uh!
- Ah.

00:51.134 --> 00:53.427
Hey, I'm gonna take off.
I just wanted to say goodbye.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.471
Rachel said she'd marry you?

00:56.556 --> 00:59.349
This isn't the right room. Sorry, folks.

01:54.072 --> 01:57.908
I don't want to be negative. So I'll say
most of the signs you bought are good.

02:01.079 --> 02:05.958
No, they ran out of "It's a Girl!"
But I can fix this one.

02:10.630 --> 02:13.132
- See? Huh?
- Mm.

02:15.176 --> 02:17.010
So sexy.

02:18.263 --> 02:19.471
- Honey?
- Yeah?

02:22.350 --> 02:24.810
- Honey, why don't you lie down?
- It's okay.

02:24.978 --> 02:28.313
Ross and Rachel will be back soon,
and then I gotta go to the office.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.444
Am I producing them?

02:35.905 --> 02:38.532
- Why are you so tired?
- I couldn't sleep last night.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.994
I started worrying about this big
divisional meeting I have today.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.329
The more I worried,
the more I couldn't sleep.

02:44.497 --> 02:48.417
You know, and then I was, like, "If I fall
asleep now, I'll get six hours' sleep.

02:48.585 --> 02:51.670
But if I fall asleep now,
I'll get five hours' sleep."

02:51.838 --> 02:54.089
No matter what I did,
I couldn't fall asleep.

02:54.257 --> 02:57.926
You know what you should've done?
Told yourself that little story.

03:00.346 --> 03:01.680
- Hi.
- Hey.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.307
- Welcome home.
- Hi.

03:03.474 --> 03:04.850
Phoebe did the signs.

03:05.768 --> 03:09.605
Oh, you guys, thanks for doing this.

03:09.772 --> 03:11.732
- Look at all that stuff people sent.
- Oh.

03:11.900 --> 03:12.941
Oh! Ha, ha.

03:13.109 --> 03:16.236
Oh, my gosh. Look, there's something
every mother needs.

03:16.404 --> 03:20.782
A giant, stuffed gorilla that takes up
the entire apartment.

03:20.950 --> 03:26.163
What are people think...?
Oh, you guys, I love it.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.333
Hey, so, uh, where's Ross?

03:29.500 --> 03:31.835
Uh, he's downstairs getting the stuff
out of the cab.

03:32.003 --> 03:34.755
- Uh, is he still mad at us?
- Well, you more than me.

03:34.923 --> 03:37.841
But he can't stay too mad at me.
I mean, I just had his baby. Ha, ha.

03:38.009 --> 03:40.260
That's not fair. I can't do that.

03:41.179 --> 03:43.513
I'm not sure you should be here
when he comes up.

03:43.681 --> 03:47.809
I didn't think I should be here either.
But somebody said he'd be over it.

03:47.977 --> 03:50.562
Hey, what do I know?
I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.

03:56.861 --> 04:00.656
The numbers we're seeing in Chicago,
New York and London are solid.

04:00.823 --> 04:05.118
But many of our field offices
have reported disappointing yields.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.669
Boston is down. Atlanta is down.
Houston is down.

04:13.836 --> 04:16.838
I could go on and on.
But instead of boring you...

04:17.005 --> 04:20.841
...I'll go straight to my 42-point plan.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.104
Walter.

04:33.898 --> 04:36.233
She's just so cute.

04:36.401 --> 04:40.153
Oh, I just want to bite her ear off
and use it as a sucking candy.

04:40.321 --> 04:42.072
Mm-hm.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.782
Phoebe. Ha, ha.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.785
But I could take one of those little feet
and put it in a pita pocket.

04:48.997 --> 04:52.791
- Okay. I put most of the stuff away.
- Oh, great. The pacifiers?

04:52.959 --> 04:55.627
- Uh, it's in the, uh, cupboard.
- The, uh, burping cloths?

04:55.795 --> 04:58.630
- Uh, linen closet.
- The diapers?

04:58.798 --> 05:00.257
In the hospital.

05:01.926 --> 05:04.636
Wow, you guys got a hospital? Fancy.

05:04.804 --> 05:06.847
No, I, uh, left the diapers
at the hospital.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.891
There's some in the bag,
but I'll run out and get some more.

05:10.059 --> 05:13.645
All right, thanks. Oh, could you stop
at the coffeehouse and get me a muffin?

05:13.813 --> 05:17.357
- Oh, sure. What kind?
- Um, let me think.

05:17.525 --> 05:22.904
What do I want?

05:23.072 --> 05:26.158
Please, take your time.
It's an important decision, not like...

05:26.326 --> 05:31.204
...say, I don't know, deciding to marry
someone. This is about a muffin.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.751
- Blueberry.
- Blueberry it is.

05:35.918 --> 05:37.836
Thank you.

05:38.921 --> 05:40.922
- Wow, he's not letting this go, is he?
- Unh.

05:41.090 --> 05:43.425
God, how long do you think
that's gonna last?

05:43.593 --> 05:47.554
I don't know. He got over the
"We were on a break" thing quickly.

05:48.848 --> 05:51.350
You know what,
I can't worry about it right now.

05:51.517 --> 05:54.811
- Because I've got the cutie little baby.
- Hmm.

05:54.979 --> 06:00.150
Oh. I can't believe how much I love her.
I mean, I can't get enough of her.

06:00.318 --> 06:02.694
Like, right now? I miss her.
I actually miss her.

06:03.696 --> 06:05.906
You know, that's her?

06:08.159 --> 06:13.038
Oh, God, look at her sleeping.
Oh, I love her so much.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.499
- I think I'm gonna wake her up. Ha, ha.
- Oh, Rach, no.

06:15.666 --> 06:18.335
You know, you're never
supposed to wake a sleeping baby.

06:18.503 --> 06:20.962
Well, I can do whatever I want.
I made her.

06:22.465 --> 06:27.177
Come on, little girl.
Oh, yes. Hello, Emma. Hello. Hi.

06:32.225 --> 06:36.311
Well, I would say I told you so,
but she's kind of doing that for me.

06:36.979 --> 06:40.190
I'm sorry. Oh, Mommy's so sorry.
Go back to sleep. Shh, shh, shh.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.275
Go back to sleep.

06:43.111 --> 06:46.822
- Oh, it breaks your heart, doesn't it?
- Oh, it really does.

06:47.740 --> 06:50.450
How long do you think
we have to stay?

06:52.286 --> 06:54.788
Okay, if everyone's on board,
it's settled.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.957
Chandler?

07:03.172 --> 07:04.506
- Chandler?
- Yeah.

07:04.674 --> 07:06.675
McKENNA:
Are you on board?

07:07.760 --> 07:09.344
Yes.

07:10.054 --> 07:13.557
Well, then problem solved.
Chandler will run our office in Tulsa.

07:13.724 --> 07:16.184
You're gonna love Oklahoma.

07:20.064 --> 07:23.733
All right. We already tried feeding her,
changing her, burping her...

07:23.901 --> 07:28.029
Oh, try this one. "Go back in time
and listen to Phoebe."

07:30.158 --> 07:32.242
- All right, here's something.
- What?

07:32.410 --> 07:34.911
It says to try holding the baby
close to your body...

07:35.079 --> 07:37.622
...and then swing her rapidly
from side to side.

07:38.332 --> 07:40.000
Okay.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.801
It worked!

07:51.429 --> 07:53.763
Oh. No. Just stopped to throw up
a little bit.

07:53.931 --> 07:54.973
Oh.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.185
Oh. Mon, what am I gonna do?

07:58.352 --> 08:01.813
It's been hours,
and it won't stop crying.

08:03.065 --> 08:07.319
- She, Rach. Not it. She.
- Yeah. I'm not so sure.

08:08.154 --> 08:11.573
- Oh, my God, I'm losing my mind.
- Yeah, no kidding.

08:11.741 --> 08:15.494
All right, this just proves no good
can come from having sex with Ross!

08:20.458 --> 08:24.628
Hey, Gunther. Can I get a couple
of blueberry muffins to go?

08:24.795 --> 08:27.005
- Diapers, huh?
- Yep.

08:27.173 --> 08:28.965
So I guess Rachel had your baby?

08:29.634 --> 08:33.053
- Yep. Can you believe it?
- Nope.

08:33.596 --> 08:36.806
I can't even believe
she slept with you in the first place.

08:37.390 --> 08:38.892
Huh?

08:39.059 --> 08:42.770
Oh. Oh. You, ha, ha,
mean, like, uh...

08:43.063 --> 08:44.731
Huh?

08:49.362 --> 08:51.071
Hey.

08:53.115 --> 08:55.951
I know you're pissed at me,
but we have to talk about this.

08:56.118 --> 08:58.787
Uh, actually, uh, we don't.

08:59.372 --> 09:03.291
Fine. Okay. But I gotta say, technically,
I didn't even do anything wrong.

09:04.919 --> 09:08.004
What? You didn't do anything wrong?

09:08.172 --> 09:11.841
- I said I didn't technically.
- Okay.

09:12.009 --> 09:14.511
Let's put aside the fact
that you "accidentally"...

09:14.679 --> 09:19.099
...picked up my grandmother's ring and
you "accidentally" proposed to Rachel.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.184
Can I just stop you there
for a second?

09:21.352 --> 09:22.936
When people do this:

09:23.104 --> 09:25.438
I don't really know what that means.

09:31.195 --> 09:32.362
You were saying?

09:32.530 --> 09:36.408
And I could even understand
that you couldn't tell Rachel.

09:36.576 --> 09:40.579
But why couldn't you tell me, huh?
You had all day to, and you didn't.

09:40.746 --> 09:44.749
I know. I should've.
"I'm sorry."

09:50.381 --> 09:52.090
Not using it right, Joe.

09:52.633 --> 09:55.552
Oh. "I'm sorry."

09:58.639 --> 10:00.015
- I'm gonna go.
- No, come on.

10:00.182 --> 10:02.559
- Ross, we have to get past this.
- Give me the bag.

10:02.727 --> 10:05.979
No, I don't know what else to do.
I said I'm sorry, now...

10:06.147 --> 10:09.024
Now you should scream at me
or curse me or hit me.

10:09.191 --> 10:11.735
- I'm not gonna hit you.
- You'll feel better. I'll feel better.

10:13.154 --> 10:15.614
You know you want to,
I can see it in your eyes.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.574
- No, I don't.
- A little bit.

10:17.742 --> 10:19.451
- No.
- Little bit.

10:20.578 --> 10:22.746
- No.
- A little bit more.

10:22.913 --> 10:25.582
- Give me the bag. Give me the bag.
- No, hit me. Hit me.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.876
- Give me the bag. I'm not kidding.
- Hit me.

10:28.044 --> 10:29.461
- No.
- Hit me. Hit me. Hit me!

10:42.475 --> 10:45.769
- You ducked!
- I'm sorry! It was a reflex!

10:45.936 --> 10:49.356
- Oh, my God! This really hurts!
- I couldn't help it.

10:49.523 --> 10:52.692
When a fist comes at your face,
you duck. Look.

10:55.529 --> 10:58.073
What is the matter with you?

10:58.240 --> 11:00.325
You were supposed to duck!
Why didn't you?

11:00.493 --> 11:02.494
Let's talk on the way to the hospital.

11:02.662 --> 11:06.956
Good. Yeah, maybe while we're there,
they can check your reflexes.

11:10.795 --> 11:12.796
Oops!

11:23.557 --> 11:26.559
- Try feeding her again.
- I already fed her.

11:26.727 --> 11:29.437
I know. That's why I said, "Again!"

11:30.606 --> 11:32.982
You guys,
we can't turn on each other, okay?

11:33.150 --> 11:35.276
That's just what she wants.

11:36.028 --> 11:37.070
- Hi.
- Hey.

11:37.238 --> 11:38.905
Monica, can I talk to you outside?

11:39.073 --> 11:42.617
Just stay here. I'm gonna check her
diaper. Pheebs, you wanna come?

11:42.785 --> 11:45.704
Oh, I'm kind of part of this.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.333
Actually, it's a husband-and-wife
kind of thing.

11:50.501 --> 11:53.002
I knew I should've married Chandler.

11:54.630 --> 11:57.340
- Okay, what's up?
- Okay. Um, ahem.

11:57.508 --> 12:00.468
You know we said it would be fun
to move to Paris for a year?

12:00.636 --> 12:03.763
And you could study French cooking,
and I could write...

12:03.931 --> 12:07.392
...and we could picnic along the Seine,
and go wine-tasting in Bordeaux.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.103
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

12:10.271 --> 12:13.314
You know how people say
that Tulsa...

12:15.192 --> 12:17.318
...is the Paris of Oklahoma?

12:19.739 --> 12:21.406
What? Who says that?

12:22.575 --> 12:25.118
People who have never been
to Paris?

12:25.953 --> 12:28.621
- Well, what's going on?
- We're moving to Tulsa.

12:28.789 --> 12:30.415
Oh.

12:32.877 --> 12:35.211
- Excuse me?
- Okay.

12:35.379 --> 12:37.714
Ms. McKenna, she kind of,
uh, works above my boss...

12:38.174 --> 12:41.551
She asked me to move to Tulsa and
be president of our office there.

12:41.719 --> 12:44.929
And I was sleeping
and apparently said yes.

12:45.097 --> 12:48.683
- Tulsa, Oklahoma?
- The Sooner State.

12:50.144 --> 12:51.978
Whatever that is.

12:52.521 --> 12:55.565
Chandler, I don't even want to see
the musical Oklahoma.

12:55.733 --> 12:58.610
"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin"'?
"Surrey With the Fringe on Top"?

12:58.778 --> 13:02.781
Are you trying to tell me we're moving
to Oklahoma or that you're gay?

13:04.867 --> 13:08.703
All right, not that this matters, but did
they at least offer you a huge raise?

13:08.871 --> 13:13.208
No. But they are going to lease us
a Ford Focus.

13:15.127 --> 13:16.669
- I'll get out of it.
- Thank you.

13:18.339 --> 13:20.507
- What is wrong with Emma?
- Oh, she misunderstood.

13:20.674 --> 13:22.634
She thought she was moving to Tulsa.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.933
Ma'am, uh, do you have a minute?

13:30.518 --> 13:34.395
I kind of have some bad news.
I don't think I can move to Tulsa.

13:34.980 --> 13:37.982
- What?
- Uh, it's a funny story, actually.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.734
Ha, ha. Ahem.

13:39.902 --> 13:43.738
Um, I kind of fell asleep
in the meeting this morning.

13:43.906 --> 13:47.408
So when I said I'd move to Tulsa,
I didn't really know what I was saying.

13:47.576 --> 13:48.827
You fell asleep?

13:48.994 --> 13:51.996
But only because I was up all night
worried about this meeting.

13:52.164 --> 13:53.832
Isn't that funny?

13:55.042 --> 13:57.710
Irony. Not a fan? All right.

13:59.713 --> 14:01.047
See, here's the thing.

14:01.215 --> 14:04.843
I went home and told my wife
about Tulsa, and she won't go.

14:05.010 --> 14:08.429
See me, I love Tulsa. Tulsa is heaven.
Tulsa is Italy.

14:08.597 --> 14:11.015
Please don't make me go there.

14:11.183 --> 14:12.725
- Chandler, I...
- No, no, no.

14:12.935 --> 14:16.062
Look, Carol. Can I call you Carol?

14:17.398 --> 14:19.858
Why would I
when your name is Elaine?

14:22.695 --> 14:24.904
Sorry. Oh!

14:25.072 --> 14:27.740
What a great picture of your son.
Strapping.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.453
That's a picture of your daughter,
isn't it?

14:33.122 --> 14:36.749
Well, she's lovely.
I like a girl with a strong jaw.

14:39.336 --> 14:41.754
I'll call you from Tulsa.

14:46.218 --> 14:48.803
Hey. So, uh, how is it?

14:48.971 --> 14:52.432
- I broke my thumb.
- Your thumb?

14:55.311 --> 14:58.146
That's weird.
Are you sure you're punching right?

14:58.314 --> 15:00.440
Make a fist.

15:01.650 --> 15:03.484
Maybe later.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.570
Ross, I feel terrible.

15:05.738 --> 15:10.033
You know what, you can go.
I just have to, uh, fill out some forms.

15:14.663 --> 15:16.623
You, uh, want me to help you with that?

15:16.790 --> 15:20.627
Why, does it look like I'm having
trouble with my misshapen claw?

15:23.714 --> 15:26.049
Name?

15:27.635 --> 15:30.511
No, I know Ross.
But what's it short for?

15:30.679 --> 15:32.722
You know, like Rossell.

15:33.223 --> 15:34.682
Or, uh...

15:34.850 --> 15:37.143
Or Rosstrophor.

15:37.311 --> 15:38.436
Just Ross.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.271
Oh.

15:40.481 --> 15:41.522
It's pretty.

15:43.359 --> 15:46.694
- Okay, date of birth?
- You know my birthday.

15:46.862 --> 15:48.780
Sure.

15:49.323 --> 15:53.451
May... tember?

15:53.619 --> 15:58.957
- October 18.
- Occupation? Dinosaurs.

16:00.584 --> 16:05.964
Actually, I'm a paleon...
Dinosaurs is fine.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.049
The drawing is not.

16:12.805 --> 16:16.057
All right. Uh, who do you want
as your emergency contact?

16:16.225 --> 16:20.269
- Uh, Rachel, I guess.
- Okay. Relationship?

16:20.437 --> 16:22.105
Ooh, boy, this could take a while.

16:24.733 --> 16:26.442
Just, uh...

16:26.610 --> 16:28.861
- Just put roommate.
- Come on.

16:29.029 --> 16:30.363
You guys are more than that.

16:30.531 --> 16:32.448
- You're gonna get together, right?
- Ahem.

16:32.616 --> 16:34.659
I don't think that we are.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.913
But you two are supposed
to be together.

16:39.081 --> 16:42.375
Well, I thought so too.
But then she said she'd marry you.

16:42.960 --> 16:45.086
Come on, Ross,
that didn't mean anything.

16:45.254 --> 16:48.798
She'd just had the baby. She was
all freaked out about doing it alone.

16:48.966 --> 16:52.343
- She would have said yes to anybody.
- Yeah, that's what she said.

16:52.511 --> 16:55.805
- So?
- So I don't want to be just anybody.

16:59.101 --> 17:00.601
- Wow.
- You know what?

17:00.769 --> 17:03.855
It's better this way anyway.

17:05.232 --> 17:08.443
I don't know what I was thinking,
going down that road again with us.

17:08.609 --> 17:13.865
It's just much easier if we're
just friends who have a kid.

17:14.032 --> 17:15.407
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:15.576 --> 17:20.204
- And you're okay with that?
- Yes. That's what we always planned.

17:20.372 --> 17:22.832
And if you have a plan,
you should stick to it.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.335
That's why they call them plans.
Hello? Ha, ha.

17:29.006 --> 17:30.673
I'm fine.

17:31.675 --> 17:33.384
Hey, for what it's worth...

17:33.552 --> 17:38.014
...with Rachel, I don't think
you'll ever be just "anybody."

17:38.182 --> 17:40.099
Hey, there you go.

17:42.352 --> 17:43.394
"Thanks."

17:49.860 --> 17:53.446
Oh, my God.
How long has she been crying?

17:53.614 --> 17:55.948
- About a week and a half.
- Oh.

17:56.116 --> 18:00.787
Well, it looks like you guys got it
under control, so I'm just gonna go.

18:02.081 --> 18:05.458
No? Really?
Misery really does love company?

18:05.626 --> 18:07.001
All right.

18:08.420 --> 18:12.256
- Try holding her a different way.
- Look, I'm doing the best I can.

18:12.424 --> 18:15.593
- Anyone else is welcome to try.
- All right, I'll try. Fine.

18:15.761 --> 18:18.012
- Yes. Okay.
- Okay, here you go.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.931
- Okay.
- Oh, gosh.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.140
Shh.

18:21.308 --> 18:23.476
Nothing works with this child!

18:24.394 --> 18:28.356
Oh, God, what am I gonna do, you guys?
I can't even comfort my own baby.

18:28.524 --> 18:31.317
- I'm the worst mother ever.
- No, you're just new at this.

18:31.485 --> 18:34.487
You'll get better. Think about
your first day at work.

18:34.655 --> 18:37.281
That couldn't have been easy,
but you figured that out.

18:37.449 --> 18:41.786
Yeah, I don't think dressing
provocatively is going to help me here!

18:41.954 --> 18:46.124
- Oh, God, just please take her.
- Okay, I'll take her. Come here.

18:46.291 --> 18:48.376
Oh, I have to go to the bathroom.

18:48.544 --> 18:52.088
- Okay.
- I have to go scream into a pillow.

18:55.884 --> 19:00.263
Bouncy. Bouncy baby. Bouncy baby.

19:00.430 --> 19:05.351
Oh, baby, baby. Oh, baby, baby.

19:05.519 --> 19:07.103
Oh, baby, baby, baby.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.692
Have I gone deaf?

19:15.070 --> 19:20.992
It worked. Oh, baby, baby, baby.
Oh, baby, baby, baby.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.828
You must be a fireball in bed!

19:25.455 --> 19:30.418
I can't believe it. She's asleep.
I got her to go to sleep.

19:30.586 --> 19:31.627
Oh.

19:31.795 --> 19:33.880
I have actual magical powers.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.426
I can hear traffic and birds.

19:38.594 --> 19:41.137
I can hear the voices in my head
again.

19:43.307 --> 19:45.183
I'm kidding.

19:48.228 --> 19:52.023
Oh, my God!
You got her to stop crying!

19:52.191 --> 19:56.360
Yes, I did. I'm Monica, super aunt.

19:56.945 --> 20:00.865
- You are the official baby-crier stopper.
- Yes, I am.

20:01.033 --> 20:05.161
- Oh. You're never leaving the apartment.
- Say what?

20:05.329 --> 20:09.749
That's your new job, day or night.
She starts crying, I need you here.

20:09.917 --> 20:13.711
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Thankfully, you don't need me at all.

20:13.879 --> 20:18.049
So okay. Hey, super aunt?
See you later. Ha, ha.

20:18.217 --> 20:21.719
Rachel?
Let's give it six to eight months.

20:25.349 --> 20:27.350
Oh.

20:30.729 --> 20:33.314
Okay, so listen,
I'm gonna go lay down.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.274
What?

20:35.442 --> 20:38.486
The book says whenever
she's sleeping, I should be sleeping.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.321
So...

20:41.823 --> 20:43.241
Thank you.

20:46.745 --> 20:48.496
- Hey.
- Shh.

20:48.664 --> 20:52.917
- We just got her to go to sleep.
- Oh, so there can't be any yelling?

20:54.795 --> 20:55.836
No.

20:59.925 --> 21:00.967
We're moving to Tulsa.

21:01.176 --> 21:02.927
- What?!
- Shh. Shh.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.303
- Chandler...
- Shh.

21:04.471 --> 21:05.972
Shh!

21:06.139 --> 21:07.932
I can't... I can't hear.

21:14.898 --> 21:18.943
- Hey.
- Hey. Where have you been?

21:21.029 --> 21:24.407
- What happened to you?
- Uh, I had a little thing with Joey.

21:24.574 --> 21:26.867
If you think this is bad,
you should see him. Ha, ha.

21:27.703 --> 21:30.913
Oh. No, Ross, this is not good.

21:31.081 --> 21:34.208
We have to talk about this Joey thing.
Please sit.

21:38.380 --> 21:42.091
All right, you have got to get over
this Joey thing.

21:42.676 --> 21:47.638
Okay? I never really wanted
to marry Joey, okay?

21:49.599 --> 21:50.641
Okay.

21:52.477 --> 21:55.146
You know what I really, really want?

21:57.316 --> 21:59.317
What, Rach?

22:00.485 --> 22:02.945
I wanna sleep.

22:04.072 --> 22:08.909
I wanna eat.
I wanna take a shower.

22:09.578 --> 22:12.705
I mean, before she wakes up,
and we gotta do this all over again.

22:13.999 --> 22:17.335
- Right.
- I mean, because I got news for you.

22:17.502 --> 22:20.546
Emma: Not easy.

22:21.590 --> 22:25.676
- Well, that's what I'm here for.
- Mm-hm.

22:28.638 --> 22:31.724
- You want me to get that?
- No, that's really okay.

22:31.892 --> 22:36.228
- Monica?
- Got it, got it, got it, got it.

22:46.907 --> 22:50.451
Uh, I've been thinking about this.
And I gotta tell you, it's not my fault.

22:50.619 --> 22:53.412
- It's a natural instinct.
- What are you talking about?

22:53.580 --> 22:56.457
Okay, what would you do if I did this?
