01:21.785 --> 01:24.274
Okay, run.

01:26.585 --> 01:28.001
Thomas.

01:28.381 --> 01:30.215
Thomas, where are ya?

01:30.596 --> 01:33.442
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

01:33.523 --> 01:37.005
Thomas! Father Thomas! Thomas, where are you?

01:39.299 --> 01:40.865
Thomas!

01:41.546 --> 01:43.542
Thomas, can you hear me?

01:43.622 --> 01:45.138
John!

01:50.820 --> 01:52.335
John.

01:53.016 --> 01:54.602
Thomas?

01:56.852 --> 01:58.471
John.

01:59.270 --> 02:00.852
Thomas!

02:04.837 --> 02:06.421
John.

02:09.502 --> 02:11.598
Where are you?

03:13.145 --> 03:16.130
- You ready, Thomas?
- Yes, John.

03:16.210 --> 03:18.687
Go. At, uh, action.

03:20.087 --> 03:23.393
Quarter to 8:00 in the mornin',
23rd of October, 1960...

03:23.473 --> 03:25.487
...in this year of our Lord.

03:26.410 --> 03:31.254
I'm Father Thomas Riley.
This is John, Father John Thornton.

03:31.835 --> 03:34.709
We're here to investigate a claim...

03:35.289 --> 03:39.321
...that a statue, uh,
of Our Lady Virgin Mary...

03:39.401 --> 03:42.607
...in the chapel here weeps blood.

03:43.645 --> 03:46.128
Uh, these photos...

03:49.522 --> 03:51.829
...and an accompanying letter...

03:51.909 --> 03:54.244
...were sent anonymously to the bishop...

03:54.324 --> 03:57.413
...who requested an immediate investigation.

03:58.613 --> 04:03.695
This would be a good time, John,
to talk to the lovely Mother Superior.

04:06.313 --> 04:08.812
- Okay? Is that alright, John?
- That was brilliant.

04:11.570 --> 04:16.709
<i>Mother Mary Carmel, the bishop
received these photographs.</i>

04:16.790 --> 04:21.009
<i>The letter's anonymous admitting
only to have come from a nun.</i>

04:21.589 --> 04:25.313
"I am writing to inform you
of the statue of Our Lady...

04:25.393 --> 04:28.243
"...in the chapel that is weeping blood.

04:28.323 --> 04:31.287
"A miracle here in our own presence...

04:31.367 --> 04:34.950
"...which the higher nuns
are attempting to conceal.

04:35.030 --> 04:37.256
"I cannot, in good conscience...

04:37.336 --> 04:40.927
...deny Our Lady
if she wishes to communicate."

04:41.007 --> 04:45.538
Would you like to comment about the
weeping statue of the Virgin and so on?

04:47.019 --> 04:50.021
Father Riley, there is nothing
I would like more...

04:50.101 --> 04:53.608
...than if our beloved Holy Mother
was sending signs here.

04:53.688 --> 04:56.137
What a beautiful thing that would be.

04:57.039 --> 04:59.060
I'm afraid you've been tricked.

04:59.140 --> 05:01.542
Tricked? By whom?

05:02.222 --> 05:04.837
They're not all good girls
in this home, father.

05:04.917 --> 05:07.497
Sure, we'll get to the bottom of it
when we interview the girls.

05:07.578 --> 05:10.737
In the meantime, I wonder,
could you give me a list...

05:10.817 --> 05:12.543
...of all the residents here?

05:12.623 --> 05:16.308
The nuns, the girls,
and, of course, any children.

05:16.388 --> 05:19.214
There are no children in the home any longer.

05:19.294 --> 05:21.782
The children's wing closed during the war.

05:24.059 --> 05:25.944
Is it blood?

05:26.585 --> 05:28.996
If it is, I'll eat my hat.

05:30.831 --> 05:34.309
- Can you not test it?
- Uh, we can't.

05:34.389 --> 05:38.007
We need it to be fresh
to get a usable sample.

05:38.087 --> 05:40.740
If it starts again, I will.

05:43.269 --> 05:46.282
I've never seen a miracle before in person.

05:46.863 --> 05:51.755
Did you read about that one?
It was in, uh, New Delhi last year.

05:51.835 --> 05:53.728
No film though.

05:54.745 --> 05:56.821
That could be us now, eh?

06:00.788 --> 06:02.998
Bought me a new camera and everything.

06:06.036 --> 06:08.312
First miracle caught on film.

06:10.635 --> 06:12.220
Imagine.

06:16.470 --> 06:20.298
You know, we could be here
for hours and see nothing.

06:20.378 --> 06:22.713
Yeah, but it'd be worth it, I hope.

06:22.793 --> 06:24.641
It won't.

06:25.284 --> 06:27.177
How is that?

06:31.233 --> 06:34.893
You know, this is a waste of your film.

06:35.819 --> 06:37.682
We could be here...

06:37.762 --> 06:41.481
...it'd be better going and getting
some of that... what do you call it?

06:41.562 --> 06:43.552
- The foot...
- The footage?

06:43.632 --> 06:46.390
Aye, footage, uh...

06:46.470 --> 06:49.978
...of the laundry room and the girls at work.

06:50.058 --> 06:52.383
Give us a better sense of the place.

06:53.064 --> 06:55.278
Uh, better use of your film.

07:20.893 --> 07:22.944
If I told you once, I told you 15...

07:23.024 --> 07:25.701
Hey. Hey!

07:26.096 --> 07:28.172
Can I ask you some questions?

07:29.724 --> 07:33.161
- <i>Is the pope gonna watch your film?</i>
- <i>No.</i>

07:33.241 --> 07:37.252
- <i>Does he have a telly in the Vatican?</i>
- <i>I think he's too busy for the telly.</i>

07:37.982 --> 07:41.602
- <i>Who is gonna see it?</i>
- <i>No one that you need to worry about.</i>

07:41.682 --> 07:44.342
<i>Now are you gonna talk to me
about the statue?</i>

07:45.175 --> 07:49.169
- <i>Have you asked the sisters?</i>
- <i>No, I'm asking you.</i>

07:49.249 --> 07:51.822
- <i>What have you seen?</i>
- <i>I didn't see nothin'.</i>

07:51.902 --> 07:53.941
- <i>Well, what have you heard?</i>
- <i>I don't know.</i>

07:54.021 --> 07:57.906
- <i>I think you do know.</i>
- <i>I never go into the chapel anyway.</i>

07:57.986 --> 08:01.884
- <i>So you do know a lot about them.</i>
- <i>We're not allowed to go in there.</i>

08:01.964 --> 08:03.785
<i>Not even for mass?</i>

08:03.865 --> 08:06.925
- <i>We're being punished.</i>
- <i>Why are you being punished?</i>

08:07.005 --> 08:10.041
<i>They need someone to clean all those sheets.</i>

08:13.743 --> 08:15.629
Hey, father.

08:17.267 --> 08:19.405
I'll do my party piece for ya.

08:19.686 --> 08:23.337
<i># If you're Irish, come into the parlor #</i>

08:23.417 --> 08:27.000
<i># There's a welcome there for you #</i>

08:27.080 --> 08:29.249
- <i># If you... ##</i>
- Dirty!

08:29.329 --> 08:32.186
You need to say your prayer,
you dirty little bitch. You're not here to...

08:32.265 --> 08:35.426
- Mother Superior, would you take it easy?
- Get into my office, now!

08:35.506 --> 08:38.114
- Why, there's no need...
- On your knees the whole way!

08:40.140 --> 08:42.631
This room is off limits, father!

08:45.323 --> 08:48.042
I hardly think we need that thing here.

08:48.122 --> 08:52.429
We've been directed to document everything,
Reverend Mother, so that's what we'll do.

08:52.510 --> 08:56.127
I you wouldn't mind getting to the point,
I have work to be getting on with.

08:56.207 --> 08:58.317
With respect, Reverend Mother...

08:58.397 --> 09:02.695
...we've become concerned about how
the girls are being treated in this home.

09:02.775 --> 09:06.214
Two of you have, have you?
You're concerned, are you?

09:06.294 --> 09:08.323
Isn't that just lovely.

09:08.403 --> 09:12.024
- Please, I'm only trying...
- Trying to what, Father?

09:12.104 --> 09:14.149
Come on, don't hold back.

09:15.314 --> 09:17.622
You've some neck on you.

09:17.702 --> 09:20.897
Coming into this home
and casting aspersions on me.

09:20.977 --> 09:23.025
Who do you think you are?

09:24.747 --> 09:28.571
You send all the country's
dirty wee secrets here...

09:28.651 --> 09:30.813
...here to my home...

09:30.893 --> 09:33.754
...and sally off without a care in the world.

09:33.834 --> 09:35.999
Sweep it all under the carpet...

09:36.079 --> 09:40.318
...and they expect us to hide
the dirty laundry. Isn't that it, Father?

09:40.398 --> 09:43.462
- Leave all the dirty work to the women.
- Reverend Mother, I don't think that...

09:43.543 --> 09:45.176
No!

09:45.757 --> 09:47.760
You don't, do you?

09:48.242 --> 09:50.859
You worry about how we treat the girls.

09:52.565 --> 09:56.950
What about how you treat us?
Leave us to hide all the messes...

09:57.030 --> 09:59.253
...and cover it all up...

09:59.333 --> 10:02.546
...and sworn and all holier-than-thou.

10:04.758 --> 10:07.860
Do you know how many
of the church's messes...

10:07.940 --> 10:11.004
...that I personally have had to clean up?

10:12.774 --> 10:16.010
Do you know how many
of the babies born here had fathers...

10:16.885 --> 10:19.504
...who were fathers, Father?

10:21.825 --> 10:25.719
Didn't think so.
Didn't think you'd want to either.

10:26.249 --> 10:29.697
Too busy lording it
about the place, aren't ya?

10:34.092 --> 10:37.260
So that was the first day
of the investigation.

10:37.340 --> 10:39.817
We're in a wing.

10:39.897 --> 10:43.908
It's isolated from the women and nuns.

10:44.488 --> 10:47.349
He's in a room down the end of the hall...

10:47.429 --> 10:49.561
...doubting Thomas.

10:49.641 --> 10:51.517
Doesn't believe in anything.

11:04.359 --> 11:06.335
I shouldn't have said that.

11:08.125 --> 11:10.401
The bishop doesn't wanna hear that.

11:12.959 --> 11:15.377
Because we were sent here for facts.

11:21.186 --> 11:25.529
It's ten past 3:00 in the morning
and I was just woken up by the signs of...

11:28.512 --> 11:30.058
See.

12:00.367 --> 12:02.309
Interview with Father Riley.

12:03.090 --> 12:06.978
What was your first experience
with the miraculous?

12:07.659 --> 12:10.709
I've never had an experience
with the miraculous.

12:13.428 --> 12:15.685
What was your first experience with evil?

12:18.127 --> 12:20.203
What is this all about, John?

12:22.704 --> 12:25.360
I've been doing this for 25 years, son.

12:28.842 --> 12:30.918
I've been all around the world.

12:32.328 --> 12:35.399
But the evil I've seen
has always been the humankind.

12:36.751 --> 12:40.009
There's no evil in this world or the next...

12:40.690 --> 12:43.930
...that can surpass that done by human hand.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.631
And that goes for the miracles as well.

12:48.875 --> 12:51.289
Oh, I've seen moving statues.

12:51.847 --> 12:56.199
I've seen Our Lady Herself standing
on the white rooftops, Portugal.

12:56.898 --> 12:59.358
I've seen water turned into wine.

13:00.039 --> 13:02.487
But all the miracles I've seen, John...

13:03.359 --> 13:05.971
...you need to pay heed to this...

13:06.051 --> 13:08.942
...can all be explained by the trickster.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.639
Fraud.

13:10.719 --> 13:14.093
Just some priest with a magic lantern.

13:15.034 --> 13:17.543
But we don't wanna believe that, do we?

13:17.623 --> 13:22.369
It's more fun, isn't it?
Less scary, isn't it...

13:23.050 --> 13:27.925
...to believe, or make ourselves
believe that it's something else?

13:28.717 --> 13:30.538
But it isn't.

13:38.564 --> 13:41.248
- What's this?
- Just listen.

13:48.169 --> 13:49.748
So?

13:51.382 --> 13:53.237
So what do you think that sounded like?

13:53.317 --> 13:58.165
I don't know. Probably some girls
up to devilment, no doubt.

13:59.537 --> 14:02.466
And you think the Mother Superior would let
the girls get away with that type of racket...

14:02.547 --> 14:04.592
...at 3 o'clock in the morning?

14:05.372 --> 14:07.386
Maybe she's a heavy sleeper.

14:22.203 --> 14:27.340
I've already taken samples
of the resin at the back of the eye...

14:27.420 --> 14:30.861
...and they're sitting in a jar in my room...

14:30.941 --> 14:33.166
...with a chemical compound.

14:33.847 --> 14:38.293
If the resin is, uh,
the cause of the blood...

14:38.373 --> 14:40.781
...then we'll know soon enough.

14:40.861 --> 14:42.612
Tonight probably.

14:42.692 --> 14:46.447
In the meantime, I'm trying
to rule out the possibility...

14:46.528 --> 14:49.487
...of deliberate m... manipulation.

14:49.568 --> 14:51.250
Fraud.

14:51.330 --> 14:54.466
By making sure that there's no mechanism...

14:54.547 --> 14:57.580
...or tubing inside the head of the statue.

14:58.794 --> 15:00.440
Is that alright?

15:00.521 --> 15:03.343
And if the resin's normal...

15:03.423 --> 15:07.144
...and, uh, there's no mechanism
in the statue, then what?

15:07.224 --> 15:10.599
Well, then I'll just have to figure out...

15:10.679 --> 15:13.170
...how else it could have been done.

15:13.751 --> 15:17.796
And would you not be telling us if it was
a miracle? I mean, maybe it is a miracle?

15:18.487 --> 15:21.560
- It isn't.
- How do you know?

15:21.940 --> 15:23.943
Because it never is.

15:25.637 --> 15:27.910
<i>Do you have any more...</i>

15:27.990 --> 15:29.875
<i>Blasphemy.</i>

15:30.619 --> 15:32.425
<i>Just press one.</i>

15:38.701 --> 15:43.736
<i>This is the mass that the Jews used
to sing at Terezin Concentration Camp.</i>

15:45.542 --> 15:48.583
- <i>But it's a mass?</i>
- <i>It's not a mass.</i>

15:48.963 --> 15:51.163
<i>It's a cry in the dark.</i>

15:51.243 --> 15:53.312
<i>Verdi was no Catholic.</i>

15:53.693 --> 15:56.706
<i>Baptized but no Catholic.</i>

15:57.186 --> 15:59.457
<i>A bit like yourself, would you say, Thomas?</i>

16:00.123 --> 16:03.778
<i>You're the one who's bootlegging
records with church resources.</i>

16:06.031 --> 16:09.880
<i>Women weren't allowed there to sing mass.</i>

16:10.561 --> 16:14.008
<i>Verdi wrote to the pope
asking for a special dispensation.</i>

16:15.671 --> 16:17.733
<i>So you see...</i>

16:17.813 --> 16:20.647
<i>...it's a mass but not a mass.</i>

16:21.127 --> 16:24.644
<i>The whole thing is a challenge
to the set order.</i>

16:24.724 --> 16:26.728
<i>And that's why it's your favorite?</i>

16:27.108 --> 16:30.659
<i>It's a soft one that you might like, Thomas?
Rebel without a cause?</i>

16:30.739 --> 16:34.374
<i>It's my favorite because it's beautiful.</i>

16:35.155 --> 16:38.215
<i>Look, it's beautiful
because it's challengin'.</i>

16:38.295 --> 16:41.094
<i>So you're saying that sometimes
rules should be broken?</i>

16:41.174 --> 16:44.636
<i>Sometimes, yes. Not very often.</i>

16:45.316 --> 16:49.241
<i>So you won't tell the bishop we used church
resources to bootleg your records then?</i>

16:49.321 --> 16:53.181
<i>This use of church resources
isn't the worst thing you could be doing.</i>

16:54.262 --> 16:56.673
<i>Oh, it's getting going now.</i>

16:58.616 --> 17:00.671
<i>Go back to the start, John.</i>

17:03.283 --> 17:05.546
It's the second night...

17:05.626 --> 17:07.749
...8:46 p.m.

17:40.600 --> 17:43.667
- ...take him by the left leg...
- Hello?

17:43.747 --> 17:46.496
Once he's at the bottom, try and...

17:46.577 --> 17:48.875
...take him by the left leg...

17:49.756 --> 17:52.761
Old Father Long-Legs can't say his...

17:55.073 --> 17:56.590
What?

18:08.482 --> 18:10.604
They're gonna kill you.

18:14.595 --> 18:16.456
I can't sleep.

18:17.539 --> 18:21.563
Because every time I close my eyes, I'm
afraid I'm gonna see that little girl again.

18:27.832 --> 18:31.103
I told Father Riley, but he didn't
believe me about what I saw.

18:32.945 --> 18:37.018
And, uh, at night, there are children...

18:39.237 --> 18:41.123
...playin' in the hallway.

19:00.867 --> 19:04.497
There is something going on in this house.

19:25.672 --> 19:29.323
Old Father Long-Legs can't say his prayers.

19:29.403 --> 19:33.400
Take him by the left leg
and throw him down the stairs.

19:33.480 --> 19:35.557
Once he's at the bottom...

20:18.681 --> 20:22.111
<i># Father Long-Legs, Father Long-Legs ##</i>

20:47.560 --> 20:49.154
Father!

21:25.255 --> 21:26.775
Thomas!

21:28.299 --> 21:29.816
Thomas!

21:30.646 --> 21:32.296
What are you doing?

21:32.376 --> 21:34.815
There's not supposed to be any children here.

21:34.895 --> 21:36.857
- You've been drinking?
- No.

21:36.937 --> 21:39.929
- You sneaking the altar wine?
- No.

21:40.009 --> 21:42.085
You were dreaming, John.

21:45.745 --> 21:48.366
Did you really not hear anything last night?

21:51.860 --> 21:54.786
If you're gonna ask
silly questions like that...

21:54.866 --> 21:58.522
...I'd rather you took your camera
and, uh, did your filmin' somewhere else.

21:58.602 --> 22:01.354
No. You don't believe in anything.

22:01.434 --> 22:03.476
Why are you a priest?

22:04.057 --> 22:07.466
Because my brother, the doctor...

22:07.547 --> 22:09.550
...was my mommy's favorite.

22:10.518 --> 22:12.550
Well, what do you expect me to say?

22:12.630 --> 22:17.490
It's a genuine question. At the very least,
you should be open to the idea...

22:17.571 --> 22:19.836
...of God trying to communicate
with us here on Earth.

22:19.916 --> 22:23.668
I am, but that's not what's happenin' here.

22:23.748 --> 22:25.828
But how do you know?

22:28.551 --> 22:30.136
Alright.

22:31.837 --> 22:33.356
Alright.

22:34.655 --> 22:37.005
You wanna know why I became a priest?

22:37.085 --> 22:40.256
I became a priest because
I wanted to be a good man.

22:40.336 --> 22:44.645
I wanted to get closer to God.
But that's not what happened.

22:44.725 --> 22:46.586
What do you mean?

22:47.872 --> 22:49.910
Look around you, John.

22:50.390 --> 22:53.714
Do you think God is here in this place?

22:55.539 --> 22:58.233
This place disgusts me.

22:58.614 --> 23:01.247
The people who run this place disgust me.

23:01.928 --> 23:04.338
The bishop who sent us here...

23:04.418 --> 23:07.741
...the Vatican itself
with its costumes and theater...

23:07.821 --> 23:10.140
...and luxury...

23:10.220 --> 23:13.118
...built on the back of ordinary people.

23:14.098 --> 23:18.315
That nun was right about
the church and its dirty secrets.

23:19.096 --> 23:20.972
And I'm sick of it.

23:22.559 --> 23:25.896
Yes, uh, I believe in God...

23:25.976 --> 23:28.393
...or I try to, anyway.

23:29.749 --> 23:33.265
But doing this kind of work
doesn't bring you any closer to God.

23:34.064 --> 23:36.340
Workin' in places like this.

23:37.450 --> 23:41.126
For these girls,
this place must be a livin'...

23:43.113 --> 23:44.925
Good God.

23:48.061 --> 23:51.575
- Father, the statue's bleedin'!
- And I can see that, sister.

23:51.655 --> 23:54.681
No, Father, all the statues are bleedin'!

24:15.561 --> 24:17.880
Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us.

24:17.960 --> 24:22.564
Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us.
Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us.

24:22.644 --> 24:25.090
Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us.

24:25.170 --> 24:30.004
Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us.
Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us.

24:30.418 --> 24:33.593
Have you ever seen anything
like this before, Thomas?

24:33.973 --> 24:36.049
Not quite like this.

24:40.024 --> 24:43.672
It has to be a miracle.
But what does She want from us?

24:43.752 --> 24:45.966
Just let me do my job, John.

24:49.664 --> 24:51.957
What have you found, Thomas?

24:52.585 --> 24:55.276
I tested the blood from all the statues.

24:57.714 --> 25:01.370
It's human blood. Type O-negative.

25:01.450 --> 25:05.687
So probably all from the same person.

25:05.768 --> 25:07.353
Female.

25:08.494 --> 25:10.771
And whoever's blood it is...

25:11.746 --> 25:12.975
...she's pregnant.

25:13.055 --> 25:16.879
Pregnant? What if the blood
doesn't belong to anyone here?

25:16.959 --> 25:18.822
It does.

25:19.202 --> 25:22.428
And whenever we find out who it belongs to...

25:23.697 --> 25:26.349
...well, we'll have found our trickster.

25:27.981 --> 25:32.462
We've asked the sisters to gather
all the pregnant inmates...

25:32.543 --> 25:36.885
...of which there are nine
in order to have their blood tested...

25:36.965 --> 25:40.617
...and none of them are a match
for type O-negative blood.

25:40.697 --> 25:43.070
We haven't tested the nuns yet.

25:43.150 --> 25:45.972
I'm not letting this go,
for propriety's sake.

25:46.985 --> 25:49.465
If they have nothing to hide,
then they've nothing to fear.

25:49.546 --> 25:53.411
- The Reverend Mother won't like that.
- Well, that's just too bad.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.651
Maybe it's one of the other girls, Father.

25:57.731 --> 26:01.175
So we'll test all the girls, Reverend Mother.

26:01.255 --> 26:06.872
She wouldn't deal with them. The only
virgins in this home are the statues.

26:06.952 --> 26:10.169
And surely the sisters, Reverend Mother.

26:10.550 --> 26:13.545
I do not appreciate your insinuation, Father.

26:13.625 --> 26:18.775
Nonetheless, every woman of childbearing
age in this house must be tested.

26:18.855 --> 26:20.669
Nuns included.

26:24.163 --> 26:27.226
I'm the one who sent
the letter to the bishop, Father.

26:27.998 --> 26:30.651
- The anonymous letter.
- That's okay, sister.

26:32.102 --> 26:36.774
The Reverend Mother made it really clear
that we were not to talk about the statue.

26:38.187 --> 26:42.229
But my conscience wouldn't
let me keep, Father, and now...

26:46.068 --> 26:48.618
...the Virgin Mother must be
very angry with me, Father.

26:48.698 --> 26:51.045
It's alright, sister. Take it easy.

26:55.190 --> 26:57.910
There are things going on in this house.

26:58.991 --> 27:02.891
- Like what?
- John, let me handle this.

27:04.415 --> 27:06.232
Okay, sister.

27:07.591 --> 27:10.399
I became a nun because God called me.

27:10.980 --> 27:13.319
Because the Virgin Mother called me.
Do you understand?

27:13.399 --> 27:14.563
Of course.

27:14.643 --> 27:17.496
So if the Virgin is making
Herself known in this place...

27:17.577 --> 27:20.022
...well, then it's my responsibility
to take heed.

27:20.102 --> 27:22.168
I'm not here to ignore Her warnings, Father.

27:22.248 --> 27:24.897
Of course, I understand that, sister.

27:26.179 --> 27:29.842
- There is evil in this place.
- What do you mean?

27:32.360 --> 27:36.061
There's a girl in the basement locked up.

27:40.730 --> 27:43.382
We're not allowed to see her
or to talk to her.

27:44.181 --> 27:46.460
Her name's Kathleen O'Brien.

27:48.539 --> 27:51.405
Sister, is this girl pregnant?

27:56.896 --> 27:58.973
The Bible says...

27:59.453 --> 28:02.089
...if your right hand
causes you to stumble...

28:02.870 --> 28:05.561
...then you cut it off and you throw it away.

28:06.847 --> 28:11.472
Would it be better that you lose one of your
members than your whole body goin' to hell?

28:13.250 --> 28:16.123
But what if it's your eyes
that have sinned, Father?

28:16.203 --> 28:20.225
Well, what do you mean?
Bearing witness is not a sin, child.

28:20.706 --> 28:22.955
It depends on how we act on that.

28:25.401 --> 28:29.755
So sometimes you sin to do good, Father?

28:30.933 --> 28:35.241
Yes, sister. And indeed
sometimes we can't do bad...

28:35.321 --> 28:37.325
...without doing good.

28:37.906 --> 28:40.546
There are no absolutes in this world.

28:41.226 --> 28:43.191
We can only hope that...

28:43.271 --> 28:47.134
...the balance of good outweighs
the bad in the end.

28:49.483 --> 28:52.144
If thine eyes offend thee, pluck them out.

28:55.365 --> 28:59.462
If thine eyes offend thee, pluck them out.

28:59.543 --> 29:01.124
Sister.

29:02.865 --> 29:06.127
Father, I'm sorry. Father,
there is such evil in this place.

29:06.207 --> 29:08.831
- Sister, it's...
- Father, I'm really sorry.

29:08.911 --> 29:11.987
Sister, it's alright. Wait! Sister, wait.

29:16.577 --> 29:21.160
No, I am not having you traipsing around
disturbing sick women at this hour!

29:21.240 --> 29:23.994
You're either taking us down
to see this Kathleen O'Brien...

29:24.074 --> 29:26.477
...or we're gonna break down
the door ourselves.

29:27.158 --> 29:29.774
You'll regret that sharp and quick.

29:30.224 --> 29:33.012
You're not prepared for this, Father Riley...

29:33.092 --> 29:36.516
...but if you want to see, I will show you.

29:38.212 --> 29:39.888
Where are we goin'?

29:39.968 --> 29:42.510
The lower infirmary is where you asked to.

29:42.590 --> 29:44.867
It's where we keep the women who are mad.

29:44.947 --> 29:47.834
Some of them are dangerous,
so watch yourself.

29:53.290 --> 29:57.993
Father, my baby. Give my baby,
please. Please, Father. No...

29:58.073 --> 30:00.169
Prepare yourself, Father.

30:03.602 --> 30:06.838
Good God. What is this?

30:06.918 --> 30:09.568
She's a danger to herself and others.

30:09.648 --> 30:13.126
- She's no more than a child.
- She's hardly a child anymore.

30:13.206 --> 30:14.958
She's lain with a man.

30:23.226 --> 30:25.302
You're pregnant, child?

30:37.839 --> 30:39.915
Were you crying, child?

30:45.855 --> 30:47.713
They're lonely.

30:48.380 --> 30:50.456
They have no mothers.

30:51.843 --> 30:54.554
I want her cleaned up
and given medical attention.

30:54.634 --> 30:57.522
And for God's sake,
get the girl some proper food.

30:58.067 --> 31:00.244
Remove these chains now.

31:00.785 --> 31:03.997
I'm not gonna ask again, Reverend Mother.

31:06.140 --> 31:08.305
Unlock her, sister.

31:08.385 --> 31:11.169
- Reverend Mother.
- Now, sister.

31:44.972 --> 31:48.362
- No. No, no, no, no, no!
- Put her back inside!

31:48.442 --> 31:50.445
Put her back!

31:51.333 --> 31:53.845
Thomas! Thomas!

31:53.925 --> 31:56.823
Now you see why we have her
locked up in there?

31:56.903 --> 31:58.924
- Thomas!
- I want someone to come down here...

31:59.004 --> 32:02.652
...and clean this girl up, Reverend Mother.

32:02.732 --> 32:04.279
God!

32:10.170 --> 32:12.451
Can you tell me your name, child?

32:13.132 --> 32:16.822
Kathleen. Kathleen O'Brien.

32:16.902 --> 32:19.707
Kathleen, I'm Father Riley.

32:20.810 --> 32:24.338
- Do you know why you've been chained up?
- The girl is dangerous.

32:24.418 --> 32:28.155
- You've seen that for yourself!
- No, that wasn't me. That wasn't me.

32:28.235 --> 32:32.366
You've got to help me. I didn't do anything.
I swear I didn't. I shouldn't be here.

32:32.446 --> 32:35.145
I didn't do it. It wasn't me. It wasn't...

32:44.091 --> 32:45.929
What did she say?

32:46.409 --> 32:49.628
This girl speaks Greek, Ancient Greek.
Who taught her that?

32:49.708 --> 32:52.089
- No one.
- How did you learn that?

32:52.169 --> 32:54.672
- I didn't learn it.
- Do you know what you said?

32:54.752 --> 32:58.046
- Yes, but I don't know how.
- She knows because she's the devil.

32:58.126 --> 33:02.604
- I'm not. I'm not. Father, please...
- I very much doubt that, Reverend Mother.

33:03.098 --> 33:05.374
Will you pray with me, Kathleen?

33:06.411 --> 33:09.451
Yes. Father, thank you.

33:10.350 --> 33:13.169
The devil can't pray, can he?

33:13.249 --> 33:15.052
She won't pray.

33:18.543 --> 33:22.975
Our Father who art in heaven
hallowed by Thy...

33:25.383 --> 33:27.722
- Oh, my... good God!
- Make her stop!

33:27.802 --> 33:30.628
- Oh, my God!
- Make her stop!

33:30.708 --> 33:32.629
- Make her stop!
- Oh, God!

33:32.709 --> 33:36.548
It's not me! It's not me
doing that, Father, I swear!

33:37.028 --> 33:41.919
Go back to your... Kathleen...
This girl, she may need to see a doctor. Now!

33:41.999 --> 33:45.099
- What did I say?
- Pray for us.

33:48.084 --> 33:49.637
Thomas...

33:50.693 --> 33:52.921
...do you think she's possessed?

33:53.374 --> 33:55.201
No, John.

33:59.790 --> 34:01.614
She's pregnant.

34:02.181 --> 34:04.416
Could it be her blood in the statues?

34:04.496 --> 34:07.118
She couldn't have done it by herself.

34:08.469 --> 34:10.089
The devil?

34:11.994 --> 34:13.572
Maybe she's evil.

34:13.652 --> 34:15.784
No more than you or I.

34:15.864 --> 34:18.219
Evil is in all of us now.

34:20.560 --> 34:23.070
She's just an ordinary girl.

34:36.215 --> 34:38.429
Evil is all around us, John.

34:41.121 --> 34:43.397
Evil is in each of us.

34:45.643 --> 34:48.581
The devil doesn't have to hide
in a pregnant young girl.

34:51.141 --> 34:53.591
He roams freely amongst us.

35:06.275 --> 35:08.924
It's half past 3:00 in the morning.

35:09.004 --> 35:13.077
I was woken again by the sound
of children in the hallway.

35:16.813 --> 35:20.499
Take him by the left leg
and throw him down the stairs.

35:20.580 --> 35:23.865
Once he's at the bottom crying...

35:24.345 --> 35:26.373
Take him by the...

35:34.175 --> 35:36.403
Sister. Hello?

35:37.576 --> 35:39.711
- Sister?
- Be quiet.

36:18.388 --> 36:20.596
John! John!

36:21.359 --> 36:22.831
You've got the camera. Come on.

36:22.911 --> 36:25.097
- My way...
- What's wrong?

36:25.177 --> 36:27.710
The statues, they're... they're broken.

36:34.451 --> 36:36.482
We're gonna lose this light.

36:46.026 --> 36:47.933
Do you see her?

36:48.313 --> 36:49.906
Thomas?

37:06.480 --> 37:08.757
Oh, Thomas, where'd she go?

37:10.177 --> 37:11.932
Where are you going?

37:12.012 --> 37:14.481
John? John?

37:18.400 --> 37:20.428
Oh, no, no, no.

37:49.290 --> 37:51.114
Do you hear that?

38:07.745 --> 38:09.264
Okay.

38:15.926 --> 38:17.422
Whoa!

38:18.003 --> 38:20.420
Thomas, careful. There's someone...

38:33.831 --> 38:37.131
Oh, my... Lord.

38:38.353 --> 38:40.219
Oh, my Lord.

38:45.026 --> 38:47.102
There was a black mass here.

38:48.373 --> 38:50.696
This is a satanic sanctuary.

38:52.385 --> 38:54.336
Uh, how do you know?

38:54.416 --> 38:58.770
I've seen one like it.
It was before in Greece, years ago.

39:01.085 --> 39:04.094
Let's hear what Mother Superior
has to say now.

39:11.285 --> 39:13.361
Father Riley, what is it?

39:14.187 --> 39:17.552
- You're fully dressed.
- I'm not going to answer my door...

39:17.632 --> 39:21.409
...in the middle of the night to two priests
in a night dress, am I? What do you want?

39:21.489 --> 39:23.314
- Come with us.
- What for?

39:23.394 --> 39:27.371
- You'll find out soon enough.
- What's this? What happened to my statues?

39:27.451 --> 39:30.730
They're all broken.
That's the least of your problems.

39:44.282 --> 39:47.346
What's this? Is this some kind of a joke?

39:47.426 --> 39:51.883
There were signs of satanic
worship here. I saw them.

39:52.363 --> 39:56.257
There were satanic symbols
on the walls and floor.

39:56.337 --> 39:58.219
Really, Father?

39:58.618 --> 40:00.493
How stupid do you think I am?

40:03.942 --> 40:05.532
Thomas.

40:06.012 --> 40:07.867
Thomas, what's happening here?

40:16.754 --> 40:19.005
Kathleen! Kathleen!

40:33.204 --> 40:35.995
Oh, God, she... she's trying to cut it out.

40:36.075 --> 40:37.896
What are you doing?

40:37.976 --> 40:39.488
Thomas!

40:40.111 --> 40:42.530
Thomas! Thomas!

40:50.546 --> 40:52.577
John, help us.

40:53.652 --> 40:56.484
Help! Somebody, help!

40:57.424 --> 40:58.975
Help!

40:59.636 --> 41:01.490
Someone!

41:01.871 --> 41:04.476
- Get this thing out of here.
- Oh, help me!

41:04.957 --> 41:07.384
We have to do this with a minimum of steps.

41:11.117 --> 41:13.210
No! Kathleen!

41:22.160 --> 41:24.464
This is Doctor Cleary.

41:24.545 --> 41:28.763
Would you mind repeating what you
just said for the camera, please?

41:31.178 --> 41:33.413
I examined the girl, Kathleen O'Brien.

41:33.493 --> 41:38.565
- It appears that she's a virgin.
- So she's not pregnant?

41:38.645 --> 41:42.888
No, you don't follow me. She is pregnant.
In fact, she's very close to giving birth.

41:42.968 --> 41:45.044
But she's also a virgin.

41:45.625 --> 41:49.286
And that she's... intact.

41:49.767 --> 41:51.978
I've never seen the like of it before.

41:52.358 --> 41:56.543
I'm sure there's a medical explanation
for it but it's beyond my experience.

41:56.623 --> 41:58.502
I've never heard of such a thing.

41:58.582 --> 42:01.604
And what do you think
is the best course of action, doctor?

42:02.206 --> 42:05.476
The girl has displayed serious issues
with harming herself...

42:05.557 --> 42:07.364
...as we know from last night.

42:08.045 --> 42:10.276
Possibly the child.

42:11.085 --> 42:14.371
She's a very sick girl, very frail...

42:14.451 --> 42:16.330
...and her body...

42:23.420 --> 42:25.504
I don't think...

42:25.584 --> 42:29.809
...she would survive labor.
She's very weak. Very frail.

42:29.889 --> 42:33.703
The child is strong. It's a healthy child.

42:33.783 --> 42:36.661
I think we need to give the child
the best chance we can.

42:37.041 --> 42:40.520
And what about Kathleen,
can we not take her to hospital?

42:40.600 --> 42:44.137
The nuns here are her primary guardians.
They feel she shouldn't leave this place.

42:44.217 --> 42:47.225
They feel very strongly
about it, in fact. I...

42:47.305 --> 42:50.309
...suggest an operation on the frontal lobe.

42:50.924 --> 42:53.954
It will calm her, make her less violent...

42:55.035 --> 42:58.737
...and perhaps we can deliver the child
as safely as possible, although...

43:00.018 --> 43:02.311
...we might not be able to save the girl.

43:03.984 --> 43:06.910
Uh, can she have a... a cesarean section?

43:06.990 --> 43:08.841
Indeed, no.

43:09.401 --> 43:12.853
I would expect you to know the church
doesn't endorse that procedure.

43:14.972 --> 43:18.658
In any case, the girl
is type O-negative blood...

43:18.738 --> 43:22.842
...and it would be nigh on impossible to find
such a rare blood type for a transfusion...

43:22.922 --> 43:25.541
...which she would need
if she had a cesarean.

43:27.168 --> 43:28.896
- So we're just gonna let her die?
- John.

43:28.976 --> 43:32.451
- No! No, we can't just let her...
- Please, John.

43:32.532 --> 43:35.790
We aren't letting her die, Father.
We will do what we can...

43:35.870 --> 43:39.427
...but in the circumstances, it's highly
unlikely she will make it. That's all.

43:39.508 --> 43:41.795
She's a very sick girl.

43:42.475 --> 43:45.494
We must try and do what we can for the child.

43:46.379 --> 43:49.927
There's something going on in this house
and you're up to your neck in it.

43:50.007 --> 43:53.489
I mean to get to the bottom of it.
Turn that damn thing off!

43:53.570 --> 43:56.019
She needs to be in a hospital.

44:02.177 --> 44:04.055
Hello, Kathleen.

44:04.561 --> 44:06.453
Hello, Father.

44:06.934 --> 44:08.834
How are you today?

44:09.214 --> 44:10.762
Sore.

44:11.572 --> 44:13.391
Hello, Kathleen.

44:16.575 --> 44:18.820
How long have you been here, Kathleen?

44:19.802 --> 44:22.278
I don't know, Father. I can't remember.

44:24.213 --> 44:27.844
Do you remember the statues upstairs?

44:28.702 --> 44:30.747
I love the statues, Father.

44:31.127 --> 44:33.570
The Blessed Virgin, especially.

44:33.650 --> 44:35.373
I pray to her.

44:36.455 --> 44:39.129
John! John!

44:40.211 --> 44:42.446
They don't like it when I...

44:42.527 --> 44:45.279
When? What, Kathleen?

44:45.359 --> 44:47.999
What? Who doesn't like it?

44:48.680 --> 44:50.849
Kathleen... what's happening?

44:50.929 --> 44:53.765
- God Almighty! God Almighty!
- Kathleen.

45:01.191 --> 45:02.735
Thomas.

45:04.712 --> 45:06.529
Oh, my God.

45:19.676 --> 45:22.727
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with Thee. Blessed art...

45:28.964 --> 45:31.774
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

46:16.825 --> 46:20.687
Be at peace. Pray for us
and the soul of Kathleen.

46:29.115 --> 46:30.496
Thomas!

46:32.059 --> 46:33.673
Thomas!

46:34.053 --> 46:38.123
John, this is the cross.
We need to take care of the room.

46:40.690 --> 46:43.557
We have to get her out of here to a hospital.

46:45.323 --> 46:47.800
Come on, Kathleen. Come to me.

46:48.267 --> 46:51.224
They... they said I can't go outside.

46:51.304 --> 46:55.380
- Maybe we shouldn't take her out.
- I think we should. This is fucking insane.

46:57.178 --> 46:59.056
It's alright.

46:59.901 --> 47:01.790
Come on, child.

47:13.034 --> 47:15.310
Thomas, no. Thomas, help her!

47:16.488 --> 47:17.536
Put it out!

47:24.754 --> 47:27.034
"Languages they could not have known."

47:27.615 --> 47:29.472
We've got that.

47:30.863 --> 47:33.349
"Supernatural strength." I'd say so.

47:34.086 --> 47:35.948
Wouldn't you, Thomas?

47:36.629 --> 47:38.633
Uh, "loss of appetite...

47:39.915 --> 47:43.878
...cutting, scratching, biting of the skin."

47:43.958 --> 47:47.188
Yes, yes, yes. "Cold feeling in the room...

47:47.869 --> 47:51.946
- ...unnatural body postures."
- We don't have that. Not from her.

47:54.364 --> 47:58.260
"Losing control and entering
into a frenzy of rage. Uh...

47:59.260 --> 48:02.677
"Knowledge of things
that were distant or hidden."

48:03.863 --> 48:05.739
I think we've got that.

48:09.463 --> 48:13.750
- Do you, really?
- Yep, and so do you.

48:14.782 --> 48:16.857
Because she knew something about you.

48:21.373 --> 48:23.266
She's resting.

48:24.867 --> 48:26.743
I'm sorry, Kathleen.

48:43.045 --> 48:47.117
This isn't gonna work,
whatever it is we're trying to do here.

48:48.403 --> 48:51.225
I'm just not good enough.

48:52.025 --> 48:53.990
I'm not strong enough.

48:55.031 --> 48:56.847
I'm sorry.

48:59.384 --> 49:01.235
I know.

49:05.707 --> 49:08.367
When she spoke to you in Greek...

49:10.199 --> 49:12.075
...what did she say?

49:18.498 --> 49:20.318
She said...

49:21.601 --> 49:23.650
...you were born here.

49:27.033 --> 49:29.129
It could be true.

49:31.759 --> 49:33.570
What do you mean?

49:34.150 --> 49:36.499
I was born out of wedlock.

49:38.739 --> 49:41.436
- Here?
- I don't know.

49:41.917 --> 49:44.480
I haven't had a chance to check the records.

49:46.336 --> 49:48.229
But I will.

49:54.014 --> 49:57.261
I was raised in an orphanage.

50:10.596 --> 50:13.179
What about your mother's
favorite, the doctor?

50:13.259 --> 50:15.056
I don't have a mother.

50:15.190 --> 50:18.742
I don't have a brother. I lied.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

50:18.822 --> 50:21.851
It's been too fucking long
since my last confession.

50:28.327 --> 50:30.220
I'm sorry, John.

50:32.439 --> 50:34.297
It's alright, Thomas.

50:41.589 --> 50:43.415
What did she say?

50:45.074 --> 50:47.017
The beasts...

50:47.097 --> 50:48.900
...below us in hell.

50:56.245 --> 50:59.828
I am in limbo. So are you.

50:59.908 --> 51:02.087
The children...

51:02.167 --> 51:04.023
...heaven is above...

51:04.566 --> 51:08.192
...but they are in hell with the beasts.

51:09.745 --> 51:11.520
Down there.

51:12.582 --> 51:16.045
<i>In some ways, limbo is worse.</i>

51:16.662 --> 51:20.559
<i>The babies have no mothers,
so I am their mother.</i>

51:21.634 --> 51:24.459
<i>They are suffering for the sins of others.</i>

51:25.400 --> 51:27.479
<i>Isn't that always the way?</i>

51:28.060 --> 51:29.950
<i>What babies?</i>

51:30.556 --> 51:32.621
<i>The dead babies.</i>

51:32.701 --> 51:34.967
<i>They killed them.</i>

51:35.047 --> 51:36.801
<i>Who killed them?</i>

51:43.021 --> 51:44.842
What is it?

51:45.896 --> 51:47.848
What's this? Have you been snooping, Father?

51:47.928 --> 51:50.201
What's your excuse this time?

51:50.281 --> 51:52.896
- You're not making sense.
- Where are all those...

51:54.389 --> 51:56.165
...where...

51:56.245 --> 51:58.566
...are all those children?

51:58.646 --> 52:01.599
These children? Why, all over the place.
America, mostly.

52:01.679 --> 52:03.558
Is that so?

52:04.105 --> 52:08.771
Well, I called the American
adoption agency listed here.

52:09.357 --> 52:11.814
So I know as well as you do...

52:12.394 --> 52:14.591
...that these records are lies.

52:14.671 --> 52:17.684
All lies. Your lies.

52:19.373 --> 52:21.792
So where are the children?

52:22.072 --> 52:23.992
You tell me, Father.

52:24.072 --> 52:27.236
You give the impression of a man who
thinks he knows what he's talking about.

52:27.316 --> 52:29.997
They're dead, aren't they?

52:30.277 --> 52:33.079
- Are you serious?
- Damn right, I'm serious.

52:33.159 --> 52:36.911
- I would appreciate you not swearing...
- I'll damn well swear where I...

52:39.694 --> 52:42.758
These babies were murdered...

52:43.909 --> 52:46.869
...and their records wiped away.

52:46.949 --> 52:50.490
- Their little lives wiped away.
- Murdered? By who?

52:50.571 --> 52:52.398
By you...

52:52.478 --> 52:56.123
...and all your evil kind.

52:57.117 --> 53:00.183
Lordy-lo, but you're a queer one.

53:04.429 --> 53:06.038
Alright.

53:07.124 --> 53:09.400
- I'll tell ya.
- Go on.

53:09.961 --> 53:11.878
- I sold them.
- What?

53:11.958 --> 53:15.824
It's not unusual. They still go
to a good home, don't they?

53:16.933 --> 53:21.214
The money to clothe and feed and house
these girls has to come from somewhere.

53:21.294 --> 53:24.323
And Lord knows the church
isn't much of a help.

53:25.409 --> 53:28.058
They still go where
they're wanted, don't they?

53:31.653 --> 53:34.481
You do know I'll be informing
the bishop of this...

53:35.523 --> 53:38.140
...and all the other
evil practices in this house.

53:38.220 --> 53:39.761
Whatever you want.

53:39.841 --> 53:43.724
But I think you'll be surprised
to learn that he's not surprised.

53:43.804 --> 53:46.122
Reverend Mother, come quickly!
Kathleen has started!

53:46.202 --> 53:48.610
- Call the doctor back.
- There isn't time.

53:48.690 --> 53:51.789
He said she probably
wouldn't survive the birth.

53:51.869 --> 53:54.940
Then that will be the end
of all our troubles, won't it?

53:58.683 --> 54:00.430
- Tie her down!
- She's not an animal!

54:00.511 --> 54:02.797
Get out of here! Have some decency!

54:03.720 --> 54:07.748
- Get her ready for symphysiotomy, sister.
- We need to get her a doctor.

54:07.828 --> 54:11.860
Do you think I've never delivered
a child before, Father? Get out of here.

54:11.940 --> 54:14.240
Stop interfering on women's business.

54:15.572 --> 54:19.288
- We'll go and get a doctor.
- Too late. She'll be done with by then.

54:19.368 --> 54:21.023
Thomas.

54:21.103 --> 54:23.707
- Thomas, we can't leave her.
- Quickly, John.

54:24.973 --> 54:26.987
I'm going to cut the ligament.

54:27.668 --> 54:29.561
Hold her, sister!

54:32.014 --> 54:36.039
Open your legs, girl. Come on,
you've done it often enough before.

54:39.208 --> 54:41.074
Think of our Lord...

54:41.555 --> 54:43.474
...feeling the thorns.

54:43.555 --> 54:46.380
The precious blood, the nails.

54:46.460 --> 54:51.038
Do you not know that suffering
is His gift to us women?

54:51.118 --> 54:53.199
Show some gratitude.

54:56.345 --> 55:01.068
<i># By the blood that flowed from Thee #</i>

55:01.148 --> 55:06.266
<i># In Thy bitter agony #</i>

55:06.346 --> 55:11.373
<i># By the scourge so meekly borne #</i>

55:11.453 --> 55:17.088
<i># By Thy purple robe of scorn #</i>

55:17.922 --> 55:23.093
<i># By the thorns that crowned Thy head #</i>

55:23.173 --> 55:28.445
<i># By Thy scepter of a reed #</i>

55:28.526 --> 55:33.763
<i># By Thy footsteps faint and slow #</i>

55:33.843 --> 55:39.250
<i># Weighed beneath Thy cross of woe #</i>

55:40.031 --> 55:45.203
<i># By the nails and painted spear #</i>

55:45.283 --> 55:50.732
<i># By Thy people's cruel jeer #</i>

55:50.812 --> 55:52.400
<i># By Thy... ##</i>

55:54.620 --> 55:56.453
Where's that damn doctor?

55:59.368 --> 56:01.444
I don't think he's coming.

56:33.332 --> 56:34.852
Kathleen?

56:40.616 --> 56:42.136
Kathleen.

56:44.251 --> 56:46.133
Oh, God.

56:46.739 --> 56:48.289
Blood.

57:16.487 --> 57:20.152
- Where's the Reverend Mother?
- Thomas, the baby.

57:22.430 --> 57:23.943
Thomas.

57:33.349 --> 57:34.893
Father.

57:37.536 --> 57:39.975
Hey, Father.

57:41.289 --> 57:43.181
Thomas, wait.

57:45.300 --> 57:47.105
They're gonna kill you.

57:51.620 --> 57:53.205
John?

57:56.360 --> 57:57.959
Hurry!

58:03.312 --> 58:07.195
<i># Father Long-Legs, Father Long-Legs ##</i>

58:19.569 --> 58:21.814
This way, John. Come on.

58:33.258 --> 58:35.248
- They're gettin' away from us.
- Listen.

58:42.411 --> 58:44.293
Come on.

58:53.042 --> 58:54.918
I think we've lost them.

58:56.888 --> 58:58.763
Hi, Father.

59:25.808 --> 59:29.108
- Dear God.
- God has nothing to do with it.

59:30.577 --> 59:32.424
Oh, no.

59:37.908 --> 59:40.454
If thine eyes offend thee, pluck them out.

59:40.535 --> 59:42.611
Oh, that's... that's alright.

59:53.592 --> 59:55.692
We should go get help.

59:55.772 --> 01:00:00.003
- From who, the priest?
- Probably that nice doctor?

01:00:00.083 --> 01:00:03.341
The bishop? Don't be naive, John.

01:00:05.681 --> 01:00:08.756
Thomas, let me go first.

01:00:09.731 --> 01:00:11.616
Ah, be careful.

01:00:32.009 --> 01:00:33.695
Ah, alright.

01:00:36.197 --> 01:00:39.410
The noise. Try that one, John.

01:00:39.791 --> 01:00:41.403
Alright.

01:00:51.604 --> 01:00:53.154
Thomas?

01:00:54.057 --> 01:00:55.867
Don't move.

01:01:07.598 --> 01:01:09.678
They're coming for us, Thomas.

01:01:32.579 --> 01:01:34.855
- John!
- Oh, my God.

01:01:37.838 --> 01:01:40.515
Keep that light, uh, on, John.

01:01:40.595 --> 01:01:42.456
- I know.
- Please.

01:01:42.537 --> 01:01:44.360
I can understand.

01:01:47.682 --> 01:01:49.537
This bulb's about to go.

01:01:49.617 --> 01:01:51.893
I only have a few matches left.

01:01:58.150 --> 01:02:00.205
What's that?

01:02:01.810 --> 01:02:04.739
Oh, Christ, there's... there's bones!

01:02:04.819 --> 01:02:07.234
Bones, John.

01:02:07.314 --> 01:02:10.820
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:02:22.614 --> 01:02:23.988
Oh, good God.

01:02:24.068 --> 01:02:26.680
You didn't believe that Kathleen
was possessed.

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:28.825
- You wouldn't.
- Save your breath...

01:02:28.905 --> 01:02:32.207
Just like you wouldn't admit that there
was miraculous goings on in the house.

01:02:32.287 --> 01:02:35.294
Miraculous in here?

01:02:46.005 --> 01:02:47.825
This way.

01:02:48.285 --> 01:02:49.584
This way.

01:03:00.343 --> 01:03:02.620
They're coming for us, Thomas.

01:03:18.895 --> 01:03:21.140
These tunnels all look the same.

01:03:33.375 --> 01:03:35.206
Thomas, look.

01:03:35.587 --> 01:03:37.663
I can remember this.

01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:47.450
Okay, go ahead.

01:04:08.788 --> 01:04:11.243
We're lost, Thomas. Listen to me.

01:04:11.724 --> 01:04:13.371
We're really lost.

01:04:13.451 --> 01:04:16.879
Keep your head. We'll find our way.

01:04:20.566 --> 01:04:23.995
We're really lost, Thomas. We're really lost.

01:04:26.893 --> 01:04:28.408
We're...

01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:30.803
...we're gonna die down here.

01:04:38.432 --> 01:04:40.048
Thomas.

01:04:40.128 --> 01:04:43.328
Thomas. Um, I can't.
I'm not going any further.

01:04:43.408 --> 01:04:45.851
It's alright, John. It's alright.

01:04:45.931 --> 01:04:48.688
Take it easy. Don't you see?

01:04:48.768 --> 01:04:52.978
We're gonna rouse the child
who's responsible for all this.

01:04:54.603 --> 01:04:56.199
I can't breathe.

01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:59.813
- Calm down, John.
- Calm down?

01:04:59.893 --> 01:05:02.915
Fucking calm down?
We're not getting out of here!

01:05:04.315 --> 01:05:06.435
Take it easy.

01:05:15.825 --> 01:05:18.056
John. John.

01:05:21.968 --> 01:05:25.274
Oh, mother of God, pray for us.
Oh, mother of God, pray for us.

01:05:25.354 --> 01:05:27.900
Oh, mother of God, pray for us.

01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:31.189
Oh, mother of God, pray for us.
What was that?

01:05:31.269 --> 01:05:33.732
- What?
- I thought I just saw a bat.

01:05:43.743 --> 01:05:45.386
Thomas.

01:06:08.997 --> 01:06:11.079
Father Thomas!

01:06:13.834 --> 01:06:15.350
Thomas!

01:06:16.698 --> 01:06:18.214
Thomas!

01:06:19.535 --> 01:06:21.393
Oh, Christ, help me.

01:06:21.674 --> 01:06:23.493
Christ, help me.

01:06:23.574 --> 01:06:25.408
Can you hear me?

01:06:27.274 --> 01:06:29.350
Thomas, can you hear me?

01:06:34.212 --> 01:06:35.785
John!

01:06:36.465 --> 01:06:38.050
Thomas!

01:06:38.577 --> 01:06:40.472
I'm here, John.

01:06:42.239 --> 01:06:44.685
- John!
- Where are you?

01:06:48.036 --> 01:06:50.030
Where are ya, son?

01:06:50.861 --> 01:06:52.872
I'm over...

01:07:21.663 --> 01:07:24.067
John! John!

01:07:24.147 --> 01:07:26.105
Oh, John!

01:07:26.185 --> 01:07:28.938
John! Oh, my God.

01:07:31.579 --> 01:07:34.567
God Almighty. Almighty.

01:07:34.647 --> 01:07:38.329
It's alright, John. It's alright. Come on.

01:07:48.751 --> 01:07:51.027
Oh, forgive me, John.

01:07:55.209 --> 01:07:59.431
You have to hope that something's...

01:08:07.133 --> 01:08:09.586
You're not getting out of this one, Thomas.

01:08:10.823 --> 01:08:12.681
Not this time.

01:08:13.622 --> 01:08:15.632
I only hope that ya...

01:08:34.729 --> 01:08:36.943
To whoever might find this...

01:08:38.194 --> 01:08:41.024
...this is the last confession
of Thomas Riley.

01:08:42.471 --> 01:08:44.371
A person or...

01:08:46.515 --> 01:08:48.410
Bless me, Father.

01:08:49.658 --> 01:08:51.517
Bless me, God...

01:08:53.809 --> 01:08:55.874
...for I have sinned.

01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:00.341
I have caused a good man...

01:09:02.004 --> 01:09:05.075
...Father John Thornton, to lose his life.

01:09:08.147 --> 01:09:09.725
Ah.

01:09:10.428 --> 01:09:13.233
I allowed my stubbornness to blind me.

01:09:14.889 --> 01:09:16.923
The statues bleeding...

01:09:18.890 --> 01:09:21.279
...the spirits of the dead children...

01:09:23.345 --> 01:09:26.386
...they were signs of the evil in this house.

01:09:29.086 --> 01:09:31.162
I don't want to think...

01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:40.826
I don't want to think
of what happened to these children.

01:09:43.912 --> 01:09:45.732
But, God...

01:09:47.675 --> 01:09:49.529
...God in heaven...

01:09:50.573 --> 01:09:53.198
...help me save this one child...

01:09:56.133 --> 01:09:57.940
...Kathleen's child...

01:10:01.150 --> 01:10:03.036
...Your child...

01:10:05.777 --> 01:10:08.678
...so I can make amends for my sins.

01:10:14.172 --> 01:10:16.455
If I was born here...

01:10:18.387 --> 01:10:20.664
...I can die here.

01:10:25.022 --> 01:10:26.604
God...

01:10:28.238 --> 01:10:30.314
...be with me now.

01:10:48.002 --> 01:10:51.284
In the name of Jesus Christ,
our God and Lord...

01:10:51.765 --> 01:10:54.571
...strengthened by the intercession
of the Immaculate...

01:10:54.951 --> 01:10:57.296
...Virgin Mary, mother of God...

01:10:57.877 --> 01:11:00.337
...of blessed Michael, the Archangel...

01:11:00.718 --> 01:11:04.511
...of the blessed apostles Peter
and Paul and all the saints...

01:11:04.591 --> 01:11:07.752
...and powerful in the holy
authority of our ministry...

01:11:07.832 --> 01:11:10.523
...we confidently undertake to repulse.

01:11:10.603 --> 01:11:12.215
God arises.

01:11:12.295 --> 01:11:16.496
His enemies are scattered and those
who hate Him flee before Him.

01:11:16.577 --> 01:11:18.612
The smoke is driven...

01:11:18.992 --> 01:11:22.985
God, the Father, command...
God, the Father, commands you!

01:11:23.065 --> 01:11:25.269
God, the Son, commands you!

01:11:25.349 --> 01:11:28.977
God, the Holy Ghost, co... commands you!

01:11:30.343 --> 01:11:32.083
Begone, Satan!

01:11:32.163 --> 01:11:34.359
Begone, Satan!

01:11:34.439 --> 01:11:36.256
Begone, Satan!

01:11:36.336 --> 01:11:40.061
Inventor and master of all deceit...

01:11:40.141 --> 01:11:43.183
...enemy of man's salvation!

01:12:04.873 --> 01:12:06.382
What?

01:12:17.349 --> 01:12:18.970
Ah!

01:12:19.050 --> 01:12:22.179
- Christ.
- Welcome home, Thomas.

01:12:41.339 --> 01:12:43.225
Hush, child.
