<i>Previously on Stargate Atlantis.</i>

00:05.300 --> 00:06.100
Ford?

00:06.500 --> 00:07.700
Thought I was dead, didn't you Sheppard?

00:07.740 --> 00:09.900
Jace here has really fine tuned the enzyme.

00:09.940 --> 00:11.900
<i>We've gotten so good we can even lace food with it.</i>

00:12.300 --> 00:13.700
Congratulations.

00:13.740 --> 00:15.300
You've just had your first dose.

00:15.700 --> 00:18.500
<i>You're gonna help us, destroy a Wraith hive ship.</i>

00:18.900 --> 00:20.700
There's been a slight change of plans.

00:21.100 --> 00:23.300
McKay's going to stay here,
while we run the op.

00:23.340 --> 00:24.900
<i>Sheppard, you there?</i>

00:24.940 --> 00:26.700
<i>I think I might have set the alarm off.</i>

00:31.700 --> 00:32.700
What do you want?

00:32.940 --> 00:35.700
The one who flew the ship.

00:49.700 --> 00:51.100
<i>And now the conclusion...</i>

00:55.500 --> 00:56.700
The ship.

01:02.100 --> 01:03.700
Where did you get it?

01:07.300 --> 01:08.500
You mean the Dart?

01:09.300 --> 01:11.500
We call them Darts because they're so pointy.

01:11.540 --> 01:12.700
Tell me.

01:13.500 --> 01:14.900
Where?

01:16.500 --> 01:18.260
I really don't wanna say.

01:32.700 --> 01:34.500
I don't even know your name.

01:38.100 --> 01:42.500
In time, you will tell me every...

01:45.300 --> 01:48.100
Tell you what? What's wrong?

01:49.300 --> 01:51.300
She didn't even tell me her name!

02:09.300 --> 02:10.500
Colonel?

02:22.900 --> 02:24.300
Are you unharmed?

02:24.340 --> 02:25.300
Yeah.

02:25.900 --> 02:27.100
Where'd they take you?

02:29.100 --> 02:31.700
A little Q and A with the Queen of the hive.

02:31.900 --> 02:33.100
What'd you tell her?

02:33.300 --> 02:35.860
It was a short conversation. She walked out.

02:35.900 --> 02:36.700
<i>Why?</i>

02:36.740 --> 02:38.700
I don't know. Maybe she was late for a meeting.

02:38.740 --> 02:43.700
No. There's something else.
I sense she was agitated, even angry.

02:44.300 --> 02:45.500
Why?

02:53.100 --> 02:55.300
Another hive ship has arrived.

04:03.500 --> 04:05.700
Are you sure there's another ship?

04:06.500 --> 04:09.100
I sense it... close by.

04:09.140 --> 04:12.100
Well, maybe they're planning
on culling the planet together.

04:12.140 --> 04:14.060
<i>- Or they're gonna fight for it.
- Either way,</i>

04:14.100 --> 04:17.700
the planet's only a few days away, so we don't
have much time if we still intend to stop them.

04:17.740 --> 04:21.300
Alright. First things first.
How to get out. Any luck?

04:21.500 --> 04:22.700
Not yet.

04:23.500 --> 04:25.500
Don't worry... I'll figure a way out.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.940
I was afraid you were gonna say that.

04:28.700 --> 04:30.900
OK, they definitely should have been back by now.

04:30.940 --> 04:34.900
Seriously, am I the only one who thinks that
maybe things haven't gone according the plan?

04:34.940 --> 04:35.900
Yes.

04:35.940 --> 04:38.900
OK, look, we can't just sit here.
We need, we need to, we need to do something.

04:38.940 --> 04:40.900
- Like what?
- Like go get help!

04:40.940 --> 04:43.500
Look, we can dial the Stargate back
to Atlantis where we have a ship...

04:43.540 --> 04:47.660
a fast ship with, with, with shields. We can fly to
the hive and then, then rescue them if we need to.

04:47.700 --> 04:51.300
Can't dial the Gate, remember? Ford removed
the control crystals from the dialing device.

04:51.340 --> 04:55.900
Yes, I know that. But here's the good news.
You're the ones guarding them.

04:55.940 --> 04:58.420
Look, all you have to do is get me
the crystals, I can fix the DHD.

04:58.460 --> 05:01.700
And then then look, you just have to walk
into Ford's little room back there and get them.

05:01.900 --> 05:04.100
We're not giving you anything.

05:04.140 --> 05:06.300
Then I can't dial the Gate.

05:06.500 --> 05:07.500
What I said.

05:07.540 --> 05:11.100
What is this, an Abbott and Costello routine?
Look, just give me the damned crystals!

05:14.300 --> 05:16.900
You want the crystals,
you're gonna have to go through us.

05:19.300 --> 05:20.660
Unbelievable!

05:28.500 --> 05:33.900
Last time we were on one of these ships, McKay was
able to open the door by cutting right into the wall.

05:35.100 --> 05:36.700
You mean like with a knife?

05:36.740 --> 05:37.660
You have a knife?

05:37.700 --> 05:40.300
One for them to find, one to keep.
Everybody knows that.

05:40.900 --> 05:43.500
Right! Forgot all about that rule.

05:43.540 --> 05:45.300
Well, it's a good thing I'm here.

05:45.700 --> 05:49.700
Right! Now, just, take your time...

05:51.300 --> 05:53.300
I said take your time!

05:53.340 --> 05:55.060
I hit the exact spot you were pointing at!

05:55.100 --> 05:56.900
Alright, alright. Anybody else have a knife?

06:07.300 --> 06:08.500
Getting warmer.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.300
How many of those things have you got?

06:12.500 --> 06:14.100
How many d'you need?

06:39.300 --> 06:47.100
OK, you can take them out, easy. Just a few well-placed
karate chops and, and, and, and down they go.

06:47.140 --> 06:49.700
Piece of cake. Let's...

06:50.300 --> 06:51.900
Are you an idiot?

07:00.300 --> 07:03.100
Desperate times, desperate measures.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.900
That's one hell of a karate chop!

07:22.900 --> 07:25.500
You must have a hell of a time going through airports!

07:30.900 --> 07:32.900
<i>Ford, what the hell are you doing?</i>

07:33.700 --> 07:35.700
- That's the last of it.
- What about the rest of us?

07:35.740 --> 07:37.500
- You don't need it.
- You don't know that.

07:39.020 --> 07:44.300
We're heading to the Dart Bay.
Stay together, and stay quiet.

07:59.500 --> 08:00.900
Lock and load!

08:16.700 --> 08:20.500
And that's what happens when you back
a brilliant scientist into a corner!

08:28.100 --> 08:29.900
Now focus, focus.

08:34.100 --> 08:36.900
Ah, control crystals! Yes!

08:49.500 --> 08:50.300
Wait.

08:51.100 --> 08:52.300
They are coming.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.260
I got it.

08:54.500 --> 08:55.340
Ford!

09:00.900 --> 09:01.700
Move!

09:03.900 --> 09:04.700
More coming!

09:04.740 --> 09:05.700
This way!

09:13.500 --> 09:15.300
Big dose! Big, big dose!

09:15.340 --> 09:17.300
But you needed it.
You needed it.

09:17.340 --> 09:19.700
To lay out the guards... idiots!

09:20.140 --> 09:22.100
"You want the crystals?
You're going to have to go through us."

09:22.140 --> 09:23.900
Well I went through you allright, didn't I?

09:23.940 --> 09:25.900
Like a hot knife trough jelly.
No...

09:26.700 --> 09:28.700
Butter.
Knife trough butter.

09:28.740 --> 09:38.100
Okay... Focus. Must finish dialing. Please, please...

09:39.500 --> 09:40.900
OK, go home.

09:59.900 --> 10:04.700
<i>Help us. Please, help us.</i>

10:05.500 --> 10:06.700
<i>She's alive!</i>

10:07.100 --> 10:08.300
<i>So is this one.</i>

10:08.700 --> 10:10.100
Let's get them out of here.

10:11.300 --> 10:14.300
We don't have time to stop.
This isn't the mission!

10:14.340 --> 10:17.500
There is no mission, Ford.
There's just your stupid plan.

10:17.540 --> 10:18.700
- If you hadn't screwed up...
- Look,

10:18.740 --> 10:23.700
the sooner you stop arguing with me and help me
save these people, the quicker we get out of here.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.100
<i>Unscheduled activation!</i>

10:31.700 --> 10:33.100
It's Doctor McKay's IDC.

10:33.140 --> 10:34.500
Lower the shield!

10:37.300 --> 10:38.700
I know what I need to do!

10:39.100 --> 10:42.500
Rodney, what's happened?
Where are the rest...?

10:42.540 --> 10:45.100
There's no time, no time.
The planet... not Ford's, the one the...

10:45.140 --> 10:46.900
ship's headed towards, we need to get
there and we don't have much time.

10:46.940 --> 10:49.300
I was barely able to escape myself,
but I managed to take out the guards.

10:49.340 --> 10:52.700
Oh, you should have seen me! I was amazing! I wish
we'd got it on camera because... That's not the point.

10:52.740 --> 10:55.500
Rodney, slow down. Are you alright?

10:55.540 --> 10:58.700
Yes, yes. I mean... I don't know.

10:58.740 --> 11:01.460
I mean, I did take out the guards and
they were huge and dumb and stupid...

11:01.500 --> 11:02.300
What guards?

11:02.340 --> 11:03.700
Ford's guards! Didn't I mentioned Ford?

11:03.740 --> 11:06.500
No, you didn't, and you haven't even
mentioned Sheppard, Teyla or Ronon either.

11:06.540 --> 11:08.300
Yes! They were there too, and there were the two guards.

11:08.340 --> 11:11.300
They were huge and massive and I had to take them out,
so I had to inject some of the enzyme.

11:11.340 --> 11:12.340
You took some of the enzyme?

11:12.380 --> 11:14.100
No-no-no-no-no-no-no.
I didn't take some of the enzyme.

11:14.140 --> 11:16.900
I took a lot of the enzyme, because I had to,
because I had to take out the guards, which I did,

11:16.940 --> 11:18.300
and you should have seen me, I was amazing!

11:18.340 --> 11:19.500
Are you insane?

11:19.540 --> 11:21.300
Yes, yes, now that I've taken the enzyme, yes.

11:21.340 --> 11:24.500
Rodney, focus. Where is Colonel Sheppard?

11:24.540 --> 11:27.700
No, no, no, I had to take the enzyme because,
because I had to take out the guards!

11:27.740 --> 11:29.300
But that's not the point...
the point is we don't have enough time.

11:29.340 --> 11:32.100
We need to stop the ship from getting
to where the ship is going.

11:32.140 --> 11:34.060
Come on, come on, let's take a
walk to the Infirmary, alright?

11:34.100 --> 11:34.700
What are you doing?

11:34.740 --> 11:39.300
No-no-no-no, I don't wanna go to the Infirmary.
I wanna go to the... the...

11:40.700 --> 11:43.100
Doctor Beckett, we have an emergency.
We're headed to you.

11:57.100 --> 11:58.100
Move!

12:56.100 --> 12:57.500
Are you alright?

12:59.300 --> 13:00.700
I think so.

13:02.100 --> 13:05.500
You were shot by Wraith stunners.
You both went down pretty quick.

13:06.300 --> 13:08.100
The effects of the enzyme must be wearing off.

13:09.700 --> 13:10.900
Where are the others?

13:19.500 --> 13:20.700
Feeling better?

13:26.300 --> 13:30.500
Her name's Neera.
Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard.

13:32.500 --> 13:33.300
Hi.

13:35.500 --> 13:36.900
Where are the others?

13:37.300 --> 13:39.300
<i>They split us up into separate cells.</i>

13:39.340 --> 13:42.500
I guess the Wraith figured keeping us
in smaller groups would make it tougher to escape.

13:44.100 --> 13:45.300
We shouldn't have stopped.

13:45.340 --> 13:47.500
- What's done is done, Lieutenant.
<i>- No!</i>

13:48.500 --> 13:53.300
First you set off the alarms, and then
you stop to rescue people when you know
damned well the Wraith are on our tail?

13:54.300 --> 13:56.700
It's like you're purposefully sabotaging this mission.

13:57.500 --> 13:59.100
<i>You hate to see me succeed at anything.</i>

13:59.140 --> 14:01.700
You've got a lot of issues to work out, Ford.

14:04.900 --> 14:07.300
Teyla and Ronon went down too quick when they were shot.

14:08.300 --> 14:09.900
<i>The enzyme's wearing off.</i>

14:11.300 --> 14:12.700
You feeling anything yet?

14:15.300 --> 14:16.300
Not yet.

14:19.300 --> 14:20.300
But I will.

14:22.700 --> 14:24.700
<i>It's happened before when I've run out of the enzyme.</i>

14:27.500 --> 14:28.900
It gets pretty bad.

14:31.300 --> 14:33.500
So we gotta figure a way out of here.

14:35.100 --> 14:37.300
And no more unnecessary stops.

14:52.700 --> 14:55.700
Colonel Caldwell!
I didn't think you were due back here for days.

14:55.740 --> 14:59.700
Doctor Weir requested that we join the search ASAP,
so we pushed the engines a little.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.300
How is he?

15:01.500 --> 15:02.700
I've sedated him;

15:02.740 --> 15:06.500
administered a beta blocker to bring his blood
pressure down to a more manageable level.

15:06.540 --> 15:08.500
<i>It's a wonder he didn't suffer a stroke.</i>

15:08.540 --> 15:11.500
Did he mention anything further about
the location of Colonel Sheppard and his team?

15:11.540 --> 15:13.500
Nothing coherent, I'm afraid.

15:13.540 --> 15:17.100
By the time he arrived here,
he was hyperventilating, pulse extremely rapid.

15:17.140 --> 15:19.100
He could barely get out a word...

15:19.140 --> 15:22.500
although, being Rodney, he certainly tried.

15:24.100 --> 15:25.700
How much of the enzyme did he take?

15:25.740 --> 15:27.500
<i>A very big dose, I'm afraid.</i>

15:27.540 --> 15:29.700
I found a significant amount of it in his system...

15:29.740 --> 15:31.500
nearly as much as Lieutenant Ford.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.900
Alright... can you wean him off it?

15:34.940 --> 15:36.500
I wish I could.

15:36.540 --> 15:40.500
Unfortunately, Lieutenant Ford took the last supply
of our enzyme when he left Atlantis,

15:40.540 --> 15:42.900
<i>so an incremental withdrawal is out of the question.</i>

15:42.940 --> 15:44.500
Unless we harvest more enzyme.

15:44.540 --> 15:49.300
Not an option. By the time you go out and collect it,
the enzyme will have broken down in his system already.

15:49.340 --> 15:52.100
No, I'm afraid for Rodney the only choice is...

15:52.140 --> 15:53.100
Cold turkey.

15:53.140 --> 15:54.580
Aye, to put it bluntly.

15:55.180 --> 15:57.220
I can administer some drugs to help ease the process,

15:57.260 --> 15:59.380
anti-nausea medication, pain reliever,

15:59.420 --> 16:03.780
benzodiazepine for anxiety, as well a sa multivitamin
injection to bolster the immune system.

16:03.820 --> 16:04.420
Good.

16:04.460 --> 16:08.420
But there's no dodging the fact it's
gonna be difficult... possibly even deadly.

16:26.560 --> 16:27.960
Are you alright?

16:28.380 --> 16:30.120
I'm just tired.

16:33.980 --> 16:35.200
No.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.800
The enzyme's leaving your bodies.

16:39.600 --> 16:41.160
Mine too.

16:48.820 --> 16:50.920
How bad will it get?

16:51.300 --> 16:54.900
Bad. Maybe not for you.

16:54.910 --> 16:57.800
You guys haven't been on the enzyme for long.

16:58.600 --> 17:01.000
But me, on the other hand...

17:11.800 --> 17:13.240
Thank you.

17:16.599 --> 17:18.560
How're you holding up, Lieutenant?

17:19.599 --> 17:24.200
OK. I just need to get my hands on some more enzyme.

17:24.599 --> 17:26.520
Then I'll be able to get us out of here.

17:26.560 --> 17:31.360
We'll do it together. With or without
the enzyme, we're a team, remember?

17:33.200 --> 17:35.040
I remember.

17:37.100 --> 17:39.140
Don't just stand there... get me more enzyme.

17:39.180 --> 17:40.340
We don't have any.

17:40.380 --> 17:44.100
It's the cave... Ford's cave... he's got a,
a whole cabinet of it. There's, there's dozens of vials.

17:45.140 --> 17:47.660
Do you know the address?

17:48.300 --> 17:49.300
What?

17:51.020 --> 17:51.900
No!

17:53.060 --> 17:54.440
I'm sorry, Rodney.

17:54.480 --> 17:56.020
You don't have to scream at me!

17:56.060 --> 17:57.220
I'm not screaming.

17:57.260 --> 17:58.860
This is fun for you, isn't
it, watching me like this?

17:58.900 --> 18:00.060
I assure you, it's not.

18:00.100 --> 18:01.700
What is this, payback? You're jealous?

18:01.740 --> 18:05.300
Jealous of how vital I am to
this mission... vital, vital...

18:05.340 --> 18:10.100
jealous of how I get to go offworld
and, and you get stuck in this stupid,
pathetic excuse for a hospital.

18:10.140 --> 18:11.460
You know that's not true.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.020
Jealous I get all the women and you don't!

18:13.060 --> 18:13.900
Excuse me?!

18:13.940 --> 18:17.540
Please, just give me a little enzyme... just
enough to take the edge off. I'm dying here.

18:17.580 --> 18:18.500
I told you, we don't have any.

18:18.540 --> 18:19.900
You think I don't know you're lying?

18:19.940 --> 18:22.300
- I'm not lying.
- You are. You think I don't think you are but you are.

18:22.340 --> 18:23.900
And don't think I won't forget it...

18:24.660 --> 18:26.060
What?

18:26.100 --> 18:28.780
I don't know! Just kill me.

18:28.820 --> 18:30.420
I wish... It'll pass.

18:30.460 --> 18:32.300
Don't shout! I am right here.

18:32.340 --> 18:34.580
Perhaps we should move him
to a more secluded area.

18:34.620 --> 18:37.420
What... so you can kill me in private?
Stab another knife in my back?

18:37.460 --> 18:40.460
Rodney... no-one's trying to kill you.

18:42.100 --> 18:44.740
You have no idea of the
agony I'm going through.

18:45.700 --> 18:47.820
Oh, I have an inkling.

18:49.100 --> 18:51.220
<i>Kanayo, you must be strong.</i>

18:51.500 --> 18:52.500
Fight it!

18:55.620 --> 18:57.460
I do not know what else to do for him.

18:57.500 --> 18:58.660
There's nothing we can do.

19:15.740 --> 19:16.860
Kanayo?

19:22.980 --> 19:24.580
He is dead.

19:27.100 --> 19:29.100
Is that what's gonna happen to us?

19:49.540 --> 19:51.460
One less for you to feed on?

20:09.900 --> 20:11.500
Take him.

20:38.580 --> 20:39.660
How is he?

20:42.340 --> 20:46.060
Asleep... finally. Mercifully.

20:48.420 --> 20:50.700
Has he mentioned anything
about Sheppard and the others?

20:50.740 --> 20:51.940
<i>No, not yet.</i>

20:51.980 --> 20:55.700
Our conversation was of a different sort.

20:56.900 --> 21:01.180
I feel not unlike the priest in The Exorcist.

21:04.620 --> 21:06.300
Well, he's through the worst of it.

21:06.340 --> 21:08.340
The nausea has passed,

21:08.380 --> 21:10.500
<i>his pulse has returned to normal,</i>

21:10.540 --> 21:15.500
blood pressure in a more reasonable range, considering
his borderline hypertensia before taking the enzyme.

21:15.540 --> 21:16.740
Good.

21:16.780 --> 21:18.100
I hate to say it

21:18.140 --> 21:20.940
but his stubbornness is probably what
sustained him throughout the ordeal.

21:22.980 --> 21:24.900
We won't tell him that, though.

21:24.940 --> 21:26.820
Aye... mustn't feed the beast!

21:27.380 --> 21:28.740
No!

21:29.700 --> 21:32.740
You should get some rest.
You look exhausted.

21:32.780 --> 21:35.500
I'll stay with him just a wee bit longer...

21:35.780 --> 21:37.540
just to make sure he's out of the woods.

21:40.020 --> 21:41.620
Carson.

21:42.500 --> 21:43.900
Nice work.

21:44.620 --> 21:46.140
Thanks, Elizabeth.

21:50.500 --> 21:52.780
Come on, buddy, hang in there. Don't leave us.

21:52.980 --> 21:54.180
Yes, Sir.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.420
I'm sorry, Sir.

21:56.460 --> 21:57.660
No, none of that.

21:57.700 --> 22:00.540
Mission's not over, remember?
We've still gotta figure a way to get out of here.

22:00.580 --> 22:01.500
<i>You hear me?</i>

22:01.540 --> 22:02.540
Yes, Sir.

22:02.620 --> 22:05.260
Aiden. You can make it through this.

22:09.940 --> 22:11.460
Move away from him.

22:13.460 --> 22:15.940
- What are you gonna do with him?
- Move away.

22:15.980 --> 22:16.780
He's sick!

22:16.820 --> 22:19.060
That is why we're taking him.

22:29.620 --> 22:32.020
Where? Where are you taking him?

22:33.700 --> 22:35.100
<i>To a cocoon.</i>

22:36.540 --> 22:39.220
It will preserve him...
keep him from dying.

22:42.100 --> 22:44.620
Until they're ready to feed.

22:59.720 --> 23:00.820
I'm sorry.

23:03.100 --> 23:06.180
It's my fault you got caught,
I should never have asked you to stop.

23:08.020 --> 23:09.020
It's OK.

23:09.820 --> 23:13.420
You were trapped in one of those cocoons,
no-one can blame you for wanting out.

23:13.460 --> 23:15.580
Now your friend has taken my place.

23:16.580 --> 23:18.300
Well not for long, not if I can help it.

23:20.860 --> 23:22.940
How will you get us out of here?

23:23.980 --> 23:28.620
OK, I haven't figured that part out yet...
but when I do, it's gonna be real impressive.

23:28.660 --> 23:31.460
The Wraith will not allow us to escape.

23:31.500 --> 23:34.660
Yeah, well, I try not to let them
tell me what I can and can't do.

23:35.700 --> 23:37.300
You do not fear them?

23:37.340 --> 23:39.740
The Wraith? Naah.

23:40.260 --> 23:44.580
Now clowns... that's another story.
Scare the crap out of me.

23:50.500 --> 23:51.900
<i>Well, look at you.</i>

23:51.940 --> 23:55.460
Ah yes, bright-eyed and
bushy-tailed, as the idiom goes.

23:55.500 --> 23:56.900
You gave us quite a scare.

23:56.940 --> 23:57.940
It was very strange.

23:57.980 --> 24:00.500
The whole time I was under the influence
of the enzyme, it felt like I was...

24:00.540 --> 24:03.300
I was perfectly lucid... eloqent, even.

24:03.340 --> 24:06.900
I mean it was you who wasn't making any sense
or listening to reason. It was very peculiar.

24:06.940 --> 24:09.860
I think I kind of understand how Ford
must have been feeling this whole time.

24:09.900 --> 24:11.100
Rodney?

24:11.900 --> 24:14.700
What happened out there?
And where are the others?

24:14.740 --> 24:19.140
I don't know exactly, but I think I can
figure it out. I told you Ford's alive.

24:19.180 --> 24:20.620
Well, you told me, but I didn't believe you.

24:20.660 --> 24:22.900
The man is nothing if not
resilient. He's been busy, too.

24:22.940 --> 24:26.340
He gathered himself together a little
gang, doped them all up on the enzyme.

24:26.380 --> 24:31.980
They're the ones that caught us, drugged us,
and coerced Sheppard, Teyla and Ronon to join
them on a mission to destroy a hive ship.

24:32.020 --> 24:33.100
A hive ship?!

24:34.100 --> 24:37.340
Yeah, they managed to steal themselves
a Dart. Like I said, he's been busy.

24:37.380 --> 24:40.180
Look, when they didn't return from the mission,
I realised something had obviously gone wrong.

24:40.220 --> 24:43.660
Now, I have the coordinates to the planet
that the hive ship was headed towards to cull.

24:43.700 --> 24:45.300
So if the team is still alive...

24:45.340 --> 24:48.700
maybe captured on the ship...
there's a chance we can rescue them.

24:48.740 --> 24:50.980
Yeah. At the very least we can warn
the planet of the impending culling.

24:51.020 --> 24:52.300
I'll alert Colonel Caldwell.

24:52.340 --> 24:53.620
Very good.

25:00.380 --> 25:01.780
How're you feeling?

25:06.100 --> 25:07.540
Better.

25:08.500 --> 25:09.500
<i>You?</i>

25:10.260 --> 25:12.340
Ready to get out of here.

25:14.660 --> 25:17.060
Have you had any luck finding a way to escape?

25:18.180 --> 25:21.420
I think our only chance is to
try to create a diversion...

25:21.460 --> 25:24.300
try to overpower them the
next time they come in here.

25:28.420 --> 25:30.740
Have you thought of Lieutenant Ford?

25:31.540 --> 25:34.980
If his withdrawal was as severe as Kanayo's...

25:37.740 --> 25:41.220
If it distracts you,
clear your mind of it.

25:42.420 --> 25:44.300
<i>If it fuels your anger</i>

25:45.300 --> 25:46.500
use it.

25:51.380 --> 25:53.220
D'you have anything sharp...

25:53.260 --> 25:56.300
knife, hairpin, anything that'd puncture
the skin on these walls?

25:56.420 --> 25:57.420
No.

25:57.860 --> 26:00.420
It's just that everyone in
my last cell had one, so...

26:01.060 --> 26:03.180
Your people were taken by the Wraith too?

26:04.580 --> 26:05.780
A few.

26:06.700 --> 26:08.660
<i>My whole world was destroyed,</i>

26:09.220 --> 26:11.700
and my people taken and brought here.

26:12.540 --> 26:16.300
I watched as my own mother and
younger brother were fed upon.

26:17.380 --> 26:19.140
Sorry to hear that.

26:19.180 --> 26:23.580
We had no means to fight the Wraith.
We are a simple, peaceful people.

26:24.420 --> 26:28.660
We're peaceful too, but the good news is,
we have the means to put up a hell of a fight.

26:28.700 --> 26:32.420
- You have fought the Wraith before?
- Lots of times.

26:32.820 --> 26:34.340
Won some battles, lost some.

26:34.980 --> 26:38.300
War's not over by a long shot, but
we're managing to hold our own.

26:39.380 --> 26:41.140
And the clowns?

26:41.180 --> 26:43.580
The clowns?
Oh, yeah, the clowns.

26:44.020 --> 26:46.020
Yeah, we fight them too...

26:46.420 --> 26:49.300
entire armies,
spilling out of Volkswagens.

26:49.740 --> 26:52.100
We do our best to fight them off, but...

26:53.140 --> 26:55.140
they keep sending them in!

26:58.820 --> 27:01.460
According to Ford's intel,
Edowin has a space Gate.

27:01.500 --> 27:05.700
If we can get there quickly in a Puddle jumper,
we wouldn't be able to do much more than just
warn people of the impending culling.

27:05.740 --> 27:06.420
Do we have enough time?

27:06.460 --> 27:07.140
- Yes.
- We think.

27:07.180 --> 27:08.180
- We should.
- We hope.

27:08.220 --> 27:11.260
It'll be close, yes, but using the Daedalus
we might be able to get a radio lock on

27:11.300 --> 27:14.780
Sheppard and the team inside the hive ship.
If they're still alive, we can beam them out.

27:15.220 --> 27:17.460
Alright. Let's get this bird off the ground.

27:17.940 --> 27:19.700
- Coming with us?
- No, no...

27:23.860 --> 27:24.900
Right!

27:34.660 --> 27:36.140
For warmth.

27:41.260 --> 27:42.140
OK.

27:44.540 --> 27:46.300
How's that? Better?

27:46.340 --> 27:48.900
Yes. Thanks.

27:51.620 --> 27:54.220
How long will they keep us in here?

27:54.420 --> 27:57.340
That's a very good question.

27:58.180 --> 28:02.460
If we're able to escape, where will I go?

28:02.980 --> 28:04.980
Wherever you want.

28:07.620 --> 28:11.340
Can I go with you to your world?

28:11.940 --> 28:14.780
Sure. Why not?

28:14.940 --> 28:17.980
I'm sure we can find a spare room.

28:18.500 --> 28:20.660
I'd like that.

28:22.860 --> 28:26.580
What is it like, your world?

28:28.460 --> 28:34.060
It's nice... comfortable, good climate.

28:34.900 --> 28:37.300
Tell me what it looks like.

28:37.780 --> 28:40.700
<i>Like every other world, I suppose</i>

28:40.740 --> 28:43.900
Trees, water, mountains.

28:44.100 --> 28:47.260
Starbucks on every corner.

28:47.420 --> 28:49.580
What is it called?

28:53.940 --> 28:58.380
D'you mind if we pick this up after we get some sleep?

28:58.420 --> 29:02.180
Yes, of course.

29:23.420 --> 29:24.700
What is it?

29:24.860 --> 29:26.500
I don't know.

29:26.780 --> 29:29.820
Must have just dropped out of hyperspace.

29:30.140 --> 29:33.380
Maybe they're getting ready for the culling.

29:34.660 --> 29:37.340
Take him.

29:59.860 --> 30:02.420
Shall we talk now?

30:02.460 --> 30:04.340
About what?

30:04.980 --> 30:06.980
You are stubborn.

30:07.020 --> 30:13.220
Yes, I am... and, she's very pretty, by the way.

30:15.260 --> 30:22.060
Neera... the girl you planted in the cocoon
for us to rescue after you let us escape.

30:22.100 --> 30:24.820
The one that was supposed to get information from me.

30:25.140 --> 30:27.500
It's never gonna happen.

30:34.100 --> 30:36.100
We drop out of hyperspace directly behind the planet...

30:36.140 --> 30:39.260
use it to shield us from the hive ship and
we can attempt radio contact with Colonel Sheppard.

30:39.300 --> 30:41.180
But we won't be able to make
radio contact from behind the planet.

30:41.220 --> 30:46.180
This is why you and Major Lorne will take a cloaked
Puddle Jumper to get close enough to determine if
Colonel Sheppard and his team are still aboard the ship.

30:46.220 --> 30:50.340
If they are, we'll move into position
around the planet and beam them out.

30:50.380 --> 30:51.860
And if they're not there?

30:51.900 --> 30:54.620
We'll beam a nuke aboard the ship and destroy it.

30:54.660 --> 30:56.260
What if they jam us like they did before?

30:56.300 --> 30:59.380
Doctor, you worry about getting Colonel
Sheppard and his team out of that ship.

30:59.420 --> 31:02.220
Let me worry about destroying it, OK?

31:11.660 --> 31:13.060
Ah, there you are.

31:13.100 --> 31:17.500
I guess an empty room is off the table,
but nice try back there in the cell.

31:17.540 --> 31:22.220
I knew there must have been a good reason for you to
let us break out, but that was quite the performance.

31:22.260 --> 31:24.060
Where'd you find her?

31:24.100 --> 31:28.500
She is one of many thousands
that have come to serve us...

31:28.540 --> 31:33.060
even worship us.

31:34.500 --> 31:37.020
They do my bidding,

31:39.780 --> 31:43.140
and I let them live.

31:43.740 --> 31:46.860
A Wraith-worshipper?

31:46.900 --> 31:51.180
The prophecy of The Great Awakening
has come to pass. The end of days have come to the...

31:51.220 --> 31:55.540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know about that because, I'm one too.

31:55.700 --> 31:59.860
Although in my case, it's not so much worship
as it is a meaningful business relationship.

31:59.900 --> 32:01.140
You lie.

32:01.180 --> 32:03.780
OK, tell me this.

32:03.820 --> 32:06.180
How else could I get my hands on a Dart?

32:06.220 --> 32:11.780
And who else could provide me
with specific instructions on how
to infiltrate your hive and destroy it?

32:11.820 --> 32:13.740
Of which queen do you speak?

32:13.780 --> 32:16.140
You gotta have a window on this boat, don't you?

32:16.180 --> 32:17.380
Take a look.

32:18.460 --> 32:21.380
The other hive that joined you for the culling...

32:21.420 --> 32:24.820
a lot more people to feed on
when you don't have to share.

32:24.860 --> 32:26.500
I will speak to her of this.

32:26.540 --> 32:29.660
You don't really think she'd admit
to trying to have you killed, do you?

32:29.700 --> 32:32.140
Enough!

32:35.740 --> 32:39.020
I shall savour your defiance!

32:54.740 --> 32:56.220
How'd you get our weapons back?

32:56.260 --> 32:57.740
That was the easy part.

32:57.780 --> 33:00.660
Getting some more enzyme... that was harder.

33:03.540 --> 33:05.980
You're one tough son of a bitch!

33:06.380 --> 33:07.820
What are you doing?

33:07.900 --> 33:10.580
Down that hall, fifty metres, turn left.

33:10.620 --> 33:12.500
It'll take you to Teyla and Ronon's cell.

33:12.540 --> 33:13.900
I'll hold the Wraith back for you.

33:13.940 --> 33:15.700
You're coming with me.

33:15.740 --> 33:18.340
I'll hold the Wraith back, boss. Now go. I'll be OK.

33:18.380 --> 33:20.340
I'm not going without you, Lieutenant.

33:20.380 --> 33:23.700
John. I'll catch up. Now GO!

33:23.740 --> 33:26.900
Ford! Oh, crap.

33:30.060 --> 33:32.380
Get ready.

33:39.220 --> 33:40.580
How about I bust you guys out of here?

33:40.620 --> 33:42.660
If you don't mind.

33:46.340 --> 33:48.420
I've gotta get myself one of these.

33:48.700 --> 33:49.580
Where's Kanayo?

33:49.660 --> 33:51.820
He is dead. Ford?

33:51.860 --> 33:55.460
Well, last I saw he was alive... I'm stickin' with that.

34:04.820 --> 34:06.700
Jumper One, you have a go.

34:06.740 --> 34:10.739
On our way. Engaging cloak.

34:23.060 --> 34:24.620
Oh, no.

34:24.940 --> 34:25.900
There's two of them!

34:25.940 --> 34:27.060
You said there was only one.

34:27.100 --> 34:28.380
- Well, there was only one!
- Now there's two!

34:28.420 --> 34:30.179
I can see that!

34:30.219 --> 34:32.620
Let's try and hail Colonel Sheppard.

34:40.020 --> 34:41.699
The culling is beginning.

34:41.739 --> 34:43.100
We've gotta stop them.

34:43.139 --> 34:43.860
How?

34:43.900 --> 34:47.820
Stay here.
When I give you my signal, get out in the open.

34:53.100 --> 34:54.940
Jumper One, what's your status?

34:54.980 --> 34:59.020
<i>We're unable to establish a radio link with Colonel
Sheppard or the others on either of the hive ships.</i>

34:59.060 --> 35:03.660
Which doesn't necessary mean they're not on
either of the ships. Look, they could have had
their radios taken from 'em.

35:03.700 --> 35:06.980
We can't make that assumption.
Return to the Daedalus immediately.

35:07.020 --> 35:08.580
Almost there now.

35:08.620 --> 35:12.420
Good. We need to take those
ships out before they start culling.

35:22.940 --> 35:24.340
Is that his signal?

35:24.380 --> 35:25.940
It'd better be.

35:35.180 --> 35:37.940
Oh, I sure hope that worked.

36:05.500 --> 36:07.380
Max power to the shields.

36:07.780 --> 36:09.100
Are we within transport range?

36:09.140 --> 36:12.420
Yes, Sir. We have a weapons lock on
coordinates inside the first enemy vessel.

36:12.460 --> 36:14.180
Deploy warhead.

36:15.460 --> 36:17.860
The enemy has engaged counter measures
to block our transport.

36:17.900 --> 36:19.860
They're jamming us again!

36:20.180 --> 36:20.940
We're under fire.

36:20.980 --> 36:23.380
Forward rail positions, return fire!

36:32.460 --> 36:34.380
This is not good.

36:34.620 --> 36:36.740
Not good, not good.

36:47.420 --> 36:48.620
<i>How much of this can the shields take?</i>

36:48.660 --> 36:51.100
Not much. They're already down twenty percent.

36:52.340 --> 36:54.140
Our people have been in Wraith hands too long.

36:54.180 --> 36:57.180
We have to assume they've been compromised and
that the Wraith know that Atlantis wasn't destroyed.

36:57.220 --> 36:58.500
We need to win this.

37:14.780 --> 37:16.260
Look... see that?

37:16.300 --> 37:17.020
What?

37:17.060 --> 37:18.940
It's a Dart firing on one of the hive ships.

37:18.980 --> 37:20.300
Why?

37:21.060 --> 37:22.620
Sheppard!

37:43.260 --> 37:45.340
I don't believe what I'm seeing.

37:45.380 --> 37:48.980
Sheppard's actually getting them to fire at each other!

38:23.780 --> 38:27.060
The blast has destroyed everything
in a fifteen thousand metre radius.

38:27.100 --> 38:28.900
Did any Darts survive?

38:29.220 --> 38:30.780
Negative, Sir.

38:46.020 --> 38:48.220
Copy that. Atlantis out.

38:48.260 --> 38:49.900
Doctor Weir?

38:53.780 --> 38:55.700
We received word from Daedalus.

38:55.740 --> 38:58.580
They said they should be back to
Atlantis by nineteen hundred hours.

38:58.620 --> 39:00.220
They called the search off?

39:00.260 --> 39:02.900
They said there was nothing to search for.

39:04.740 --> 39:06.500
Thank you.

39:16.900 --> 39:19.060
<i>Offworld activation!</i>

39:20.100 --> 39:21.100
Who is it?

39:21.140 --> 39:22.420
We have an IDC.

39:22.460 --> 39:23.700
It's Colonel Sheppard's code!

39:23.740 --> 39:25.900
Let them in!

39:36.420 --> 39:38.260
Sorry we're late.

39:57.420 --> 40:00.180
Alright. Up you go.

40:00.540 --> 40:01.660
Why aren't you dead?

40:01.700 --> 40:03.380
Ah, it's good to see you too, Rodney.

40:03.420 --> 40:06.900
No, no, I mean... well, you know what I mean.
Why aren't you... dead?

40:07.220 --> 40:09.820
Well, I knew when the hives started
to shoot at each other,

40:09.860 --> 40:15.900
it was just a matter of time before they blew
each other up, so I went to the space Gate and
dialed an address where I could land safely.

40:15.940 --> 40:18.340
I didn't think the Dart could fit in our Gateroom.

40:18.380 --> 40:22.500
The Colonel was kind enough to make us
whole again, and we returned home.

40:22.540 --> 40:25.300
I'm curious, Sheppard... how did you
know the Wraith would fight each other?

40:25.340 --> 40:27.700
A little intel from Ford in the game, plus...

40:27.740 --> 40:30.580
well, I kinda goosed things along with the Queen.

40:30.620 --> 40:34.020
It would appear the Wraith are becoming
more territorial than we had thought.

40:34.060 --> 40:37.140
There is definite tension building among them.

40:37.180 --> 40:38.340
Which is good for us.

40:38.380 --> 40:39.540
<i>Certainly is.</i>

40:39.620 --> 40:43.620
It also opens a brand new strategy in fighting them.

40:46.460 --> 40:48.420
And, and, where is Ford?

40:50.020 --> 40:52.380
He was aboard the hive ship when it was destroyed.

40:52.420 --> 40:55.780
He was last seen aboard the hive ship.

40:56.220 --> 40:57.900
What does that mean?

40:58.460 --> 41:04.340
Well, you know Ford. I wouldn't be
surprised if we run into him again.
