00:28.987 --> 00:32.741
The following is an interpretation
of events based on..

00:49.424 --> 00:52.344
I used to love the carnival.

00:53.679 --> 00:56.890
Daddy worked all the fairs
selling pretzel's...

00:59.434 --> 01:02.354
Always looking for something better.

01:03.105 --> 01:06.024
Sometimes mama would follow him...

01:06.233 --> 01:09.319
sometimes he even take us.

01:10.112 --> 01:11.905
It was always a new adventure...

01:15.075 --> 01:16.451
I figured Jennie and me, were...

01:20.914 --> 01:24.001
My favorite was the merry-go-round...

01:24.418 --> 01:27.421
Maybe I was a little
old for it, but...

01:35.387 --> 01:40.184
The merry-go-round, just goes
round and round, and up and down.

01:42.769 --> 01:46.773
It don't go anywhere,
but I always felt save.

02:05.959 --> 02:09.213
That's me on the left.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.590
Sylvia.

02:12.007 --> 02:14.676
And that's my story.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.735
I'm a Prostitute and proud of it.

02:52.881 --> 02:55.175
Would you please state your name.

02:55.384 --> 02:57.094
Lester Likens.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.543
Do you think,
we'll make new friends?

03:29.918 --> 03:31.420
Sure we will.

03:40.971 --> 03:42.389
Hey!

03:48.478 --> 03:51.315
Hi Betty, can I talk
to for a minute?

03:52.858 --> 03:55.819
You know, I've been talking
to a Horst and he says...

04:17.090 --> 04:20.219
You two, go on ahead and
catch the church bus home.

04:30.521 --> 04:34.024
See what love the
father has given us...

04:38.820 --> 04:41.240
And so we are!

04:48.080 --> 04:51.708
Christ said: I am the way.
The truth, the live and love.

04:56.463 --> 05:00.801
Our families,
our fathers, our mothers.

05:01.218 --> 05:04.805
It is only through Christ,
that we find our father.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.735
Oh, that's a beautiful dress, Hope.

05:21.280 --> 05:24.408
And huh... I'm feeling much
better, with my new medicine...

05:30.789 --> 05:32.791
Thank you.

05:39.756 --> 05:41.341
What happened to your leg?

05:48.891 --> 05:50.726
Polio?

05:53.103 --> 05:55.105
Our mama is a sick too.

05:56.148 --> 05:57.941
All right girls!

05:58.775 --> 06:00.277
We gotta go.

06:02.654 --> 06:04.948
You wanna come? We've got
some friends coming over...

06:25.719 --> 06:28.263
Guess who got stuck with
an extra shift at work?

06:36.772 --> 06:37.940
What's this?

06:48.283 --> 06:50.536
I really like this song.

06:51.203 --> 06:52.621
What's your dad do?

07:13.684 --> 07:14.935
Finished!

07:40.669 --> 07:42.713
We're goin' to groceries.

07:51.346 --> 07:54.266
- She don't like my boyfriend.
- Yeah, I can see that.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.896
Sorry, Mrs. Doyle.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.148
Hey!

08:05.652 --> 08:07.529
Let's get outta here.

08:07.946 --> 08:10.365
That's my sister Stephanie,
she's big help around the house...

08:14.494 --> 08:16.455
Oh, God.

08:16.747 --> 08:18.165
Hey, Paula.

08:33.514 --> 08:35.641
Just like her mom.

08:38.560 --> 08:40.270
That's him.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.192
He's real cute.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.571
We got both to be real
careful about it.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.617
Because he's married.

08:55.202 --> 08:58.163
I'm not even shittin' you, no!

09:00.833 --> 09:03.293
Don't tell me you never
had a boyfriend.

09:03.961 --> 09:08.257
Ah, well, there was this guy
in California, but...

09:09.132 --> 09:10.884
I guess it was nothing.

09:15.264 --> 09:18.183
Well, aren't you just so damn pure.

09:23.772 --> 09:25.357
Let's go!

09:26.942 --> 09:30.612
<i>This is Pleiku,
250 miles north of Saigon.</i>

09:50.424 --> 09:51.967
Marie!

10:04.021 --> 10:05.606
Hello!

10:10.944 --> 10:13.322
You got no family here in Indy?

10:17.159 --> 10:19.494
'Cause of them or you?

10:22.289 --> 10:24.666
Hi, Mrs. Baniszewski,
is Shirley and Marie here?

10:30.881 --> 10:34.176
Looks like, you've got kids running
in and outta here, all day long.

10:39.014 --> 10:42.392
Why don't you leave Sylvia
and Jenny, here with me?

10:44.895 --> 10:47.189
No, I... I couldn't do that.

10:59.159 --> 11:02.621
<i>20 dollars a week and
you don't have to worry.</i>

11:06.208 --> 11:08.544
You'd be helping me out too.

11:08.877 --> 11:11.964
I could talk to
my wife about it.

11:15.259 --> 11:18.053
Something to consider.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.138
Ah-ha...

11:22.015 --> 11:26.103
So, you'd never met Gertrude
Baniszewski before that day?

11:33.151 --> 11:35.153
Well, like I said, huh...

11:45.247 --> 11:47.541
<i>Okay! Here is 20 now...</i>

12:07.895 --> 12:11.315
Okay, kids.
Goodbye, Jenny, Cookie.

12:11.815 --> 12:13.609
- You be good!
- Okay.

12:16.570 --> 12:17.946
Bye.

12:21.033 --> 12:23.493
You girls make sure you get
everything you need.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.581
Well, come on!

12:34.463 --> 12:36.423
Wait, I'll help you.

12:56.151 --> 12:57.903
Nothing to be nervous about.

13:28.016 --> 13:30.185
I live right around the corner,
I'm Ricky Hobbs.

13:39.903 --> 13:41.655
Good bye!

13:45.492 --> 13:47.035
It's me!

13:52.499 --> 13:55.377
Came by to see my baby.

14:02.467 --> 14:03.886
Hi!

14:06.930 --> 14:08.599
Leave him!

14:15.689 --> 14:17.691
Put him back in.

14:19.985 --> 14:23.238
It took me all day to quiet him.

14:24.615 --> 14:27.534
- Not in front of the baby!
- Why? He don't care.

14:32.498 --> 14:35.209
Listen, I'll be getting
a paycheck.

14:40.005 --> 14:42.758
Who's gonna take care of you?

14:44.468 --> 14:47.262
Well, actually I was wondering...

14:55.979 --> 14:59.107
If I had the money,
I'd give it to you.

15:13.372 --> 15:15.582
I'm sorry, Gertie.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.960
I'm sorry.

15:25.968 --> 15:28.595
So, how was the
first day at school?

15:46.572 --> 15:49.908
You know, Paula is looking more
and more like you everyday.

15:50.826 --> 15:52.870
Lucky girl.

15:54.246 --> 15:56.707
Should watch her, though.

15:57.082 --> 16:00.002
She's been hanging out
with Bradley again.

16:00.794 --> 16:03.213
I hate to think, what'll happen.

16:13.974 --> 16:16.894
You think, that I can
get that money?

16:21.398 --> 16:24.401
<i>There's a 20 in the top drawer.</i>

16:44.379 --> 16:46.548
Where do you live Mrs. Doyle?

17:03.065 --> 17:05.442
No, I felt sorry for the lady.

17:12.741 --> 17:15.077
Oh, no, I can't judge her.

17:17.454 --> 17:20.040
I can't judge her.

17:22.167 --> 17:25.379
- Would you like to say prayer, Sylvia?
- Sure.

17:26.839 --> 17:29.007
Bless this food we eat,
and release...

17:37.140 --> 17:39.768
Somebody get out there,
and feed that dog!

17:46.316 --> 17:47.943
Sorry, I'm late.

17:50.153 --> 17:53.365
I took up the shift
for Ellen.

17:54.783 --> 17:57.160
I told you, I didn't want you
to see that boy anymore.

18:01.915 --> 18:04.877
What? Was he here?
Did Andy say something?

18:05.210 --> 18:07.421
- That's none of your business.
- Yeah, you just don't want...

18:18.849 --> 18:21.518
I said, feed that dog!

18:25.606 --> 18:28.066
Johnny, feed the dog!

18:40.120 --> 18:42.456
What's wrong, Paula?

18:44.416 --> 18:47.252
I've got problems, Sylvia.

18:48.003 --> 18:50.464
Big problems.

18:53.759 --> 18:55.928
With Bradley?

19:00.724 --> 19:03.936
I went to the doctor, today.

19:05.979 --> 19:08.398
I'm pregnant.

19:14.530 --> 19:17.115
You know the guy is married,

19:24.957 --> 19:27.584
Well, you... you gotta tell him.

19:27.835 --> 19:30.045
I can't.

19:30.587 --> 19:33.048
Well, I think you gotta.

19:34.800 --> 19:39.763
You gotta promise me, that you
wont say anything to anybody.

19:40.848 --> 19:45.394
Not a word, until I figure out
what I'm gonna do, okay?

19:47.187 --> 19:49.565
Yeah, I promise.

19:53.151 --> 19:55.445
It's gonna be okay.

20:58.258 --> 21:00.219
Mama?

21:06.517 --> 21:08.352
Mama!

21:18.987 --> 21:21.365
I want you all, upstairs!

21:22.699 --> 21:24.743
Come on.

21:25.369 --> 21:27.538
Except for you two!

21:29.206 --> 21:31.917
I want you down in the basement!

21:47.516 --> 21:50.435
Your daddy's' check
didn't arrive today.

21:53.146 --> 21:56.733
I know my Mama, she wouldn't
let him forget.

22:04.616 --> 22:07.327
I think your mama and daddy...

22:09.872 --> 22:11.748
They wouldn't do that.

22:19.339 --> 22:21.550
Lean over those.

22:22.134 --> 22:24.553
Go on, lean over.

22:40.402 --> 22:43.071
- No!
- Come on! Come on.

23:11.975 --> 23:13.977
Okay.

23:14.728 --> 23:16.605
Come on.

23:24.488 --> 23:26.573
Okay.

23:32.454 --> 23:35.165
I need that money.

23:52.975 --> 23:55.519
Come on, Jennie...

23:58.021 --> 24:02.150
It's not like, we never
had a spanking before.

24:04.027 --> 24:08.198
You know, that check's gonna
come tomorrow, I swear.

24:26.258 --> 24:28.594
- Johnny!
- What? Give me the thing back!

24:38.103 --> 24:41.273
I wonder if Bradley
is gonna be there.

24:43.025 --> 24:45.319
<i>Freedom was in jeopardy...</i>

24:45.736 --> 24:49.031
<i>when the struggling
people had been brought...</i>

24:53.410 --> 24:57.831
<i>When William Westmoreland,
was called to urgent duty.</i>

25:09.885 --> 25:12.763
<i>But to execute that mission...</i>

25:12.804 --> 25:15.349
<i>he had to fight the most
complex war...</i>

25:35.744 --> 25:38.288
Look, I shot his eye out.

25:42.543 --> 25:43.752
You're dead!

25:47.005 --> 25:49.716
Listen, God! This is crap!

25:59.017 --> 26:00.853
Howdy!

26:04.898 --> 26:08.068
You know?
Don't know about you...

26:08.318 --> 26:10.612
but, I'm staying up,
all night, tonight.

26:17.703 --> 26:20.998
- You like it here?
- Yeah, it's really nice.

26:23.292 --> 26:25.002
I'll be right back.

26:33.302 --> 26:34.887
Hey!

26:34.928 --> 26:36.221
Ricky.

26:53.739 --> 26:55.240
What're you doing here?

26:58.911 --> 27:02.581
I just be right back.

27:03.665 --> 27:05.209
Good!

27:10.088 --> 27:14.009
Now, be a good girl,
and go play with your friends.

27:15.886 --> 27:18.639
You know, my Mama's
been calling you trash.

27:21.350 --> 27:24.978
You should listen to your
mother, Paula, she knows best.

27:31.985 --> 27:35.197
- Is this what you want, huh?
- Stop it! Stop!

27:39.618 --> 27:41.328
She is pregnant!

27:48.168 --> 27:52.130
Don't try to pull that shit on me!
You know, it ain't true.

27:52.840 --> 27:54.842
There ain't no way.

27:56.718 --> 27:58.971
Stay away.

28:00.639 --> 28:02.683
Paula, I'm so sorry.
I just wanted to...

28:11.108 --> 28:13.068
Is everything okay?

28:27.457 --> 28:29.168
Paula?

28:30.627 --> 28:32.337
Honey, you're crying!

28:35.549 --> 28:38.343
I ain't talking to him anymore.

28:44.516 --> 28:47.269
You know, we're gonna find
you a good man, Honey.

28:51.190 --> 28:53.775
But Sylvia said...

28:54.109 --> 28:55.986
What?

28:59.281 --> 29:03.243
She telling horrible lies,
about me.

29:06.288 --> 29:08.707
What kind of lies?

29:13.629 --> 29:17.174
She's telling everyone,
that I'm a slut.

29:20.010 --> 29:22.054
You should have seen those
boys when they heard...

29:25.641 --> 29:28.060
Sylvia said that?.

29:36.109 --> 29:38.362
Don't worry, Baby.

29:39.321 --> 29:41.657
Don't worry.

29:47.579 --> 29:52.125
Did you ever hear Sylvia, use
any vanity or vulgar language?

30:11.228 --> 30:14.273
For the gate is wide and
the way is easy...

30:22.072 --> 30:26.159
When the gate is narrow
and the way is hard...

30:49.308 --> 30:52.060
Jennie, come sit with me!

31:12.289 --> 31:15.417
We gotta go upstairs and change.

31:16.543 --> 31:19.296
I want you all down here.

31:19.546 --> 31:21.715
Family-meeting.

31:23.884 --> 31:26.303
It's a lesson for all of you.

31:42.486 --> 31:45.239
You need to apologize to Paula.

31:52.246 --> 31:53.413
But Gertie, I... I don't know...

31:58.168 --> 32:01.296
She's been spreading lies
about your sister.

32:10.180 --> 32:12.182
I'm sorry.

32:13.475 --> 32:17.271
Paula, you have the right,
to get even.

32:19.982 --> 32:22.234
I want you to punish her, mama.

32:24.778 --> 32:26.864
You have to learn to fight
your own battles, baby.

32:29.908 --> 32:31.535
I said I was sorry.

32:36.123 --> 32:38.959
Go on, she's got it coming.

32:45.215 --> 32:46.717
Let her go!

32:47.467 --> 32:49.720
I'm sure, she
can defend herself.

32:57.060 --> 32:58.937
I am not.

33:05.194 --> 33:07.112
Damn it!

33:07.613 --> 33:09.823
Enough, that's okay!

33:12.659 --> 33:13.827
Get up.

33:19.333 --> 33:21.543
She's learned her lesson.

33:21.877 --> 33:24.755
That's what happens
when you tell lies.

33:25.964 --> 33:27.841
Go on!

33:38.393 --> 33:40.354
You too, get!

34:03.335 --> 34:05.629
Are you awake?

34:11.260 --> 34:13.387
You're okay?

34:16.515 --> 34:19.351
Did you say your prayers yet?

34:22.020 --> 34:24.857
How about mamas favorite psalm?

34:31.238 --> 34:35.325
Turn on to me, and be
gracious to me, dear lord.

34:36.034 --> 34:39.413
For I am lonely and affected.

34:47.588 --> 34:50.841
Consider how many are my foes...

34:51.300 --> 34:52.467
Thank you.

34:57.181 --> 35:00.601
Make my life in to a better me.

35:01.602 --> 35:04.688
I will not think of the shame.

35:05.564 --> 35:08.317
I take refuge in thee!

35:10.819 --> 35:14.740
And take thee in greatness be sure.

35:18.076 --> 35:20.704
Amen.

35:38.222 --> 35:40.724
- I hear, your sister's pregnant.
- I see you.

35:44.811 --> 35:47.189
I didn't say it.

35:48.398 --> 35:50.776
A lotta people are talking.

36:14.675 --> 36:16.760
Why aren't you in school?

36:27.563 --> 36:29.857
You, huh... doing okay?

36:31.650 --> 36:32.860
Yeah.

36:35.404 --> 36:37.155
Yeah.

36:38.240 --> 36:40.284
Eric.

36:40.367 --> 36:42.619
I, huh... I've
seen you at church.

36:45.330 --> 36:47.833
You're going to the, huh...
pick-nick, next Saturday?

36:49.126 --> 36:51.378
Well, huh... I hope so.

36:59.178 --> 37:01.013
Huh... I'm gonna go.

37:01.305 --> 37:03.182
Okay.

37:06.518 --> 37:09.730
Why was Mama so upset
about the other day?

37:17.529 --> 37:20.866
There's some worse rumors
going around, about her.

37:24.203 --> 37:26.705
Do you think, she's pregnant?

37:40.552 --> 37:42.429
Thanks.

37:43.680 --> 37:45.974
How's your mama?

37:46.475 --> 37:48.310
Okay.

37:48.685 --> 37:51.104
She still in the hospital?

37:58.320 --> 38:00.614
Who's taking care of you?

38:03.325 --> 38:05.369
I am.

38:07.704 --> 38:10.541
Oh, you don't have a girlfriend?

38:12.417 --> 38:14.044
I don't know.

38:22.636 --> 38:24.263
You wanna a sip?

38:28.976 --> 38:31.186
You ain't old enough
to smoke, either...

38:38.527 --> 38:40.445
Jennie?

38:41.071 --> 38:44.116
I think, we should call mom and dad.

38:44.533 --> 38:46.743
How we're supposed to do that?

38:56.086 --> 38:59.798
So, huh... how long's Sylvia
gonna be staying here?

39:00.424 --> 39:03.343
You got a crush on Sylvia?

39:10.767 --> 39:13.061
She is pretty.

39:14.688 --> 39:16.732
When I was in high-school...

39:22.988 --> 39:25.324
I believe you.

39:25.824 --> 39:27.576
Thank you.

39:28.869 --> 39:31.413
Oh, are you warm.

39:37.586 --> 39:40.339
What're you doing home
from school so early?

39:44.009 --> 39:45.844
Paula?

39:46.386 --> 39:48.514
You better go.

39:49.973 --> 39:52.059
Alright, you first.

40:07.616 --> 40:10.536
Oh, Gertrude's awful strict, mama.

40:25.759 --> 40:27.135
<i>Sylvia?</i>

40:30.556 --> 40:32.558
They're coming, mama.

40:42.025 --> 40:44.820
Calling your boyfriend, Sylvia?

40:44.945 --> 40:46.405
No.

40:51.660 --> 40:53.704
Thank you, Jennie.

40:54.037 --> 40:56.582
Where'd you get the money to
make a long-distance call?

41:18.604 --> 41:20.314
What she's gonna do?

41:24.193 --> 41:26.987
Are you gonna lie to me again?

41:27.029 --> 41:30.157
- No, Gertie, I...
- You gonna steal is this household?

41:40.876 --> 41:42.377
Alright.

41:45.005 --> 41:46.048
I'm sorry!

41:46.256 --> 41:47.758
I'm sorry!

41:54.431 --> 41:58.018
Okay, okay, that's a good girl,
that's a good girl.

42:02.689 --> 42:05.317
You wanna put some ice on that.

42:14.326 --> 42:17.829
Now, I think you stated, Marie,
that your sister Paula...

42:28.549 --> 42:30.843
Angry at someone.

42:39.268 --> 42:41.687
I guess, because Sylvia thought...

42:55.659 --> 42:59.162
I haven't seen you eat
up in a few weeks.

43:03.083 --> 43:05.335
What's with your arm, Paula?

43:06.170 --> 43:09.131
I lost my temper, with Sylvia.

43:09.464 --> 43:11.967
So, what'd you mean,
what happened?

43:14.261 --> 43:17.639
She's been doing some real
terrible things.

43:22.519 --> 43:24.813
Come on, its Ok.
It's Ok, come on.

43:25.272 --> 43:27.107
Don't take too much.

43:28.609 --> 43:30.319
Hey, what're you doing here?

43:34.406 --> 43:37.075
I hope you don't want
any money, because...

43:46.001 --> 43:49.421
- Did you say hi to the baby yet?
- Ah-ah.

43:52.257 --> 43:55.677
- Look, about yesterday...
- It's fine, it's fine.

44:08.190 --> 44:09.691
Hey.

44:10.192 --> 44:11.693
Hi.

44:12.528 --> 44:15.531
A couple of my friends, are eating
over there, you wanna join us?

44:16.240 --> 44:18.534
- Sure.
- Okay.

44:19.284 --> 44:21.078
Sylvia!

44:25.999 --> 44:30.128
Ricky, remember what I said
the other day about Paula?

44:30.170 --> 44:32.214
Did you say something?

44:32.339 --> 44:34.174
No.

44:34.341 --> 44:35.884
Because people are talking...

44:42.015 --> 44:43.851
I better go.

44:49.231 --> 44:51.942
I understand she's pregnant?

44:52.109 --> 44:53.944
He says, he's willing to
pay for the abortion.

45:05.539 --> 45:08.750
There's not gonna be an abortion,
because she's not pregnant.

45:13.547 --> 45:18.343
That girl's been nothing but trouble
since she came in to my house.

45:18.635 --> 45:22.431
If anyone is pregnant,
she is, I'll bet she is.

45:26.310 --> 45:28.145
I gotta go.

45:28.896 --> 45:30.439
Bye, Kenny.

45:30.814 --> 45:32.691
Bye.

45:34.902 --> 45:36.778
He'll be back, baby.

45:41.158 --> 45:44.620
Coming over to hang out
with the grown-ups?

45:50.501 --> 45:53.086
I've got some advice for you.

45:53.295 --> 45:56.089
I wouldn't come between
Gertie and her kids,

46:06.016 --> 46:07.559
You okay, Gertie?

46:09.436 --> 46:11.855
Yeah, I'm fine.

46:13.690 --> 46:17.569
A bunch of us, gonna cruise the
circle, you wanna come with?

46:18.487 --> 46:22.115
Sure, I probably should
ask Gertie first.

46:22.741 --> 46:24.701
You sure?

46:26.119 --> 46:28.705
Come on, let's get outta here!

46:34.795 --> 46:37.422
Looks like Sylvia's going
off with them boys.

46:44.346 --> 46:46.515
Let me do that!

46:49.101 --> 46:51.562
You can try, Patty.

46:55.107 --> 46:58.026
You sure you can't come,
to the Drive-in with us?

46:59.278 --> 47:02.781
No, I'm... I'm late as it is.

47:03.699 --> 47:05.200
Let's go!

47:08.620 --> 47:11.540
Well, I guess, I'll see you
next Sunday then.

47:24.636 --> 47:26.805
Shut that door.

47:39.234 --> 47:42.863
I dought, I thought you a lesson.

47:47.117 --> 47:49.870
I don't understand.

47:56.793 --> 47:59.129
I haven't told any lies.

48:03.717 --> 48:06.845
- And then you flirt with, Andy.
- I didn't.

48:07.012 --> 48:09.556
I saw you!

48:14.520 --> 48:19.942
No matter what you want,
you just... you just take it.

48:20.776 --> 48:24.905
No, Gertie, we were just talking.

48:26.406 --> 48:28.659
That's all.

48:34.122 --> 48:35.874
Who's in charge here?

48:49.137 --> 48:53.141
Paula, told me about those
boys in California.

48:53.517 --> 48:57.688
Ricky, did Sylvia tell you, about
all those boys in California?

48:59.273 --> 49:01.358
No.

49:03.026 --> 49:04.653
Well' if you won't listen to me...

49:07.155 --> 49:10.492
Keep her from making
those mistakes.

49:12.119 --> 49:15.080
Do you wanna be like your sister?

49:17.791 --> 49:19.459
No, ma'am.

49:21.170 --> 49:23.422
That's a good girl.

49:56.580 --> 49:59.333
Patty, then what did
Mrs. Baniszewski do?

50:11.512 --> 50:15.724
Did Sylvia say anything, when
Mrs. Baniszewski ask her to do this?

50:16.558 --> 50:18.685
All she said was...

50:28.362 --> 50:30.822
What Gertie told her to.

50:32.449 --> 50:34.743
What the hell is going on?

50:35.202 --> 50:37.204
Somebody, clean up the mess!

50:44.837 --> 50:46.004
Wait!

50:56.807 --> 50:59.142
Get her outta here!

50:59.226 --> 51:01.645
No! Noooo...

51:04.982 --> 51:08.735
Don't worry, Jennie,
Mama's just teaching her.

52:10.964 --> 52:12.883
Hey, Marie!

52:45.499 --> 52:47.417
Sylvia.

52:48.335 --> 52:50.212
Sylvia.

52:55.217 --> 52:57.636
I'm sorry, Sylvia.

52:59.096 --> 53:01.014
But, I'm to scared.

53:01.932 --> 53:05.602
I've tried talking,
with Gertie, but...

53:09.231 --> 53:14.027
She... she said,
you can have your bible.

53:17.447 --> 53:19.241
Jennie.

53:19.700 --> 53:22.286
Mama wants you upstairs.

53:26.206 --> 53:28.458
I'll do what I can.

53:29.710 --> 53:31.795
She said now.

53:54.276 --> 53:56.320
Stop hitting me!

53:58.572 --> 54:01.575
Johnny, get me my medicine, please.

54:02.701 --> 54:06.830
Oh, this area here,
it's not good for my health.

54:07.289 --> 54:09.041
Maybe we can move.

54:20.802 --> 54:23.764
I had a call with
your parents today.

54:32.272 --> 54:34.775
Their checks are coming
in regular, though.

54:55.796 --> 54:57.798
Paula...

54:58.382 --> 55:01.760
Baby, you gonna have to take
up more shift's at work.

55:05.764 --> 55:08.350
What about Stephanie?

55:08.392 --> 55:11.395
- Why she have to go to school?
- Because she's smarter than you.

55:22.906 --> 55:25.784
That's another thing we have
to work on around here.

55:30.122 --> 55:34.585
How long is Sylvia,
down in the basement?

55:36.920 --> 55:40.090
Until she learns her lesson.

55:42.426 --> 55:44.052
Mama...

55:46.638 --> 55:49.141
She needs to be punished, Paula.

55:52.227 --> 55:54.104
Yes, Mama.

55:56.523 --> 55:59.193
Now, if anybody asks...

55:59.318 --> 56:03.614
Sylvia... had to go to juvenile.

56:08.785 --> 56:10.787
You got that, Jennie?

56:17.628 --> 56:19.630
Okay.

56:20.422 --> 56:22.299
That's it.

56:48.158 --> 56:50.244
Are you sleeping?

56:56.458 --> 56:58.544
You okay?

57:01.922 --> 57:03.924
Yes.

57:05.384 --> 57:08.053
It's only gonna be for a little while.

57:19.648 --> 57:23.360
Did you ever hear or see, Sylvia,
talk back to any of those people...

57:36.456 --> 57:39.168
she never did anything wrong.

57:39.626 --> 57:44.464
Did you yourself, on any of these
occasions, do anything to Sylvia?

57:44.631 --> 57:47.176
I just did what I was told.

57:50.262 --> 57:52.681
Now then, in the month of
September did you see she was an influx

58:37.643 --> 58:40.020
See, I told you so.

58:43.857 --> 58:45.108
Damn.

58:53.575 --> 58:54.743
Johnny!

58:59.414 --> 59:01.416
Watch this!

59:08.048 --> 59:09.216
Neat, huh?

59:47.045 --> 59:51.466
Did you see Sally, take cigarettes,
and actually burn Sylvia with them?

59:57.222 --> 59:59.141
How many times did that happened?

1:00:01.018 --> 1:00:03.896
Did you go to 3850 East New York St...

1:00:21.038 --> 1:00:22.539
Playing around.

1:00:22.789 --> 1:00:25.000
Did you ever tell some of the other
kids that they should come over...

1:00:34.301 --> 1:00:35.469
Right in front of her.

1:00:47.439 --> 1:00:50.567
Did you tell anybody,
you saw anything?

1:00:51.109 --> 1:00:53.237
Not really.

1:00:54.071 --> 1:00:58.283
So, you told no one, what was happening
at the Baniszewski's house?

1:00:59.076 --> 1:01:00.744
Well, I told my father...

1:01:10.045 --> 1:01:11.839
Shirley, was your mother
ever present...

1:01:18.762 --> 1:01:21.098
She was there, just
about all the time.

1:01:26.186 --> 1:01:27.688
Nothing.

1:01:34.027 --> 1:01:37.030
Did anyone order you, to hit Sylvia?

1:01:37.489 --> 1:01:39.074
No, Sir.

1:01:46.456 --> 1:01:48.208
I don't no, Sir.

1:01:48.417 --> 1:01:50.377
I don't no, Sir.

1:01:50.627 --> 1:01:52.671
I don't no, Sir.

1:02:00.262 --> 1:02:02.181
You two, go upstairs.

1:02:24.244 --> 1:02:27.623
Paula Baniszewski.
Pregnancy test, Urinalysis.

1:02:35.464 --> 1:02:37.424
Who is it?

1:02:39.426 --> 1:02:41.512
You got any cigarettes?

1:03:00.280 --> 1:03:03.033
Hear anything from Sylvia?

1:03:05.244 --> 1:03:07.788
You really like her, don't you?

1:03:08.705 --> 1:03:11.583
She's not good for you, Honey.

1:03:13.794 --> 1:03:16.338
You know, when she's gonna be back?

1:03:18.090 --> 1:03:23.178
Ricky, I told you, she wont
have anything to do with you.

1:03:23.554 --> 1:03:26.473
She's to busy with other boys.

1:03:27.349 --> 1:03:30.519
That's why I had to
send her to juve.

1:03:31.812 --> 1:03:33.397
Hand me that!

1:03:37.025 --> 1:03:38.944
- Get!
- Alright, I'll go.

1:03:45.158 --> 1:03:46.743
Here's your money.

1:03:47.035 --> 1:03:48.996
Thank you, baby.

1:03:51.999 --> 1:03:56.461
Honey! You are a good daughter,
I'm so proud of you.

1:03:57.296 --> 1:04:01.800
It don't matter what people say,
you'd be holdin' your head up high.

1:04:02.885 --> 1:04:05.262
We're gettin' through this.

1:04:06.638 --> 1:04:09.141
What about Sylvia?

1:04:13.312 --> 1:04:15.272
Look...

1:04:15.564 --> 1:04:17.900
I've been praying...

1:04:18.942 --> 1:04:21.069
and I think, maybe it's time
to forgive her.

1:04:24.031 --> 1:04:27.409
Their are things in life,
we have to do...

1:04:31.246 --> 1:04:34.458
Well, I don't want any part of it.

1:04:35.959 --> 1:04:37.753
Paula.

1:04:39.254 --> 1:04:41.256
Paula?

1:05:08.742 --> 1:05:12.162
Hey, Sylvia? I'm not
gonna hurt you, okay?

1:05:12.204 --> 1:05:14.706
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1:05:28.971 --> 1:05:32.558
I know what it's like
to be sick, Sylvia.

1:05:44.987 --> 1:05:48.156
I've been sick for so long, too.

1:05:50.325 --> 1:05:52.661
I can't...

1:05:52.786 --> 1:05:56.582
discipline my kids,
the way that I should.

1:05:59.918 --> 1:06:03.213
I'm punishing you I known, but...

1:06:03.338 --> 1:06:05.299
sometimes, when I take medicine...

1:06:14.516 --> 1:06:17.644
And I care for you, so much.

1:06:24.693 --> 1:06:27.321
With Paula, the thing is...

1:06:28.864 --> 1:06:31.825
Paula is a lot like me.

1:06:34.036 --> 1:06:38.290
I had her, when I was,
just about your age.

1:06:43.337 --> 1:06:47.132
And then along came, Stephanie...

1:06:49.092 --> 1:06:51.762
and then all the others.

1:06:55.224 --> 1:06:56.558
And...

1:07:07.361 --> 1:07:10.155
And here I am, just huh...

1:07:12.908 --> 1:07:16.703
doing everything I can,
to keep my Family together.

1:07:18.247 --> 1:07:21.500
I want something better for Paula.

1:07:26.255 --> 1:07:29.049
There has to be something better.

1:07:41.728 --> 1:07:45.399
And I need to protect my children.

1:07:48.569 --> 1:07:51.405
Do you understand that?

1:07:52.030 --> 1:07:54.199
These kids...

1:07:54.867 --> 1:07:57.369
they're all I've got.

1:08:16.680 --> 1:08:18.599
Thank you, Sylvia.

1:08:22.477 --> 1:08:24.062
Thank you.

1:08:40.996 --> 1:08:42.122
Oh, lord.

1:08:42.664 --> 1:08:44.458
Okay.

1:08:48.587 --> 1:08:50.589
Hello, Reverend.

1:08:54.426 --> 1:08:55.969
I've been meaning to
come by and visit...

1:09:06.188 --> 1:09:10.067
Well, she's concerned about you
and the whole house.

1:09:14.404 --> 1:09:17.115
I think, Paula may be pregnant.

1:09:17.282 --> 1:09:20.369
Now, I'm prepared to offer
what support I can...

1:09:57.489 --> 1:10:00.534
I'm afraid, I had to
send her to juvenile.

1:10:00.784 --> 1:10:04.204
I just could not handle that girl.

1:10:27.436 --> 1:10:30.355
Why don't you take
little Kenny, please!

1:10:39.823 --> 1:10:42.242
I'll see you on Sunday then.

1:10:47.915 --> 1:10:49.374
Sure, Reverend.

1:11:00.802 --> 1:11:02.971
Don't you have any sense?

1:11:05.432 --> 1:11:08.977
- I'm doing this for you!
- Let go off me!

1:11:15.859 --> 1:11:18.737
I want everybody in the basement!

1:11:24.576 --> 1:11:26.245
You know why you're here.

1:11:35.838 --> 1:11:38.757
Ricky, she came back.

1:11:39.007 --> 1:11:41.677
She came back from juvenile...

1:11:44.179 --> 1:11:45.681
Stop it!

1:11:47.641 --> 1:11:49.059
Johnny, hold her!

1:11:55.315 --> 1:11:56.984
Light that!

1:12:02.614 --> 1:12:05.033
Please! Please! Please!

1:12:05.117 --> 1:12:07.077
- Stop it!
- Is this alright, Mama?

1:12:10.873 --> 1:12:13.167
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
- You Liar!

1:12:15.502 --> 1:12:18.297
Please no! Please!

1:12:20.090 --> 1:12:23.010
You branded my daughter.

1:12:23.969 --> 1:12:26.847
Now, I'm gonna brand you.

1:12:35.105 --> 1:12:36.899
Ricky!

1:12:37.316 --> 1:12:39.985
Come here! Finish it!

1:12:41.987 --> 1:12:43.906
Gertie, I can't.

1:12:44.239 --> 1:12:49.786
Ricky, she was with every boy,
but you.

1:12:49.828 --> 1:12:52.164
You can't let her
get away with this.

1:12:54.666 --> 1:12:56.752
Please, help me, Ricky.

1:12:56.793 --> 1:12:58.670
Please! Please!

1:12:58.837 --> 1:13:00.923
Good boy.

1:13:01.965 --> 1:13:04.009
Ricky!

1:13:07.846 --> 1:13:09.681
What does it say?

1:13:10.224 --> 1:13:13.060
It says: "I'm a Prostitute...

1:13:13.977 --> 1:13:15.687
and proud of it".

1:13:21.235 --> 1:13:23.820
NO! NO! Stop it! NO!

1:13:38.085 --> 1:13:40.128
Sylvia.

1:13:41.880 --> 1:13:44.299
You've gotta get outta here.

1:13:44.716 --> 1:13:46.552
You gotta leave.

1:13:55.769 --> 1:13:58.105
Oh, I can't...

1:14:03.402 --> 1:14:05.195
Shh...

1:15:06.465 --> 1:15:08.008
Mama?

1:15:10.135 --> 1:15:12.346
- You gotta get outta here!
- I don't no where to go.

1:15:18.936 --> 1:15:20.270
No! No!

1:15:24.024 --> 1:15:26.443
- Just let me go!
- Mama, stop!

1:15:45.796 --> 1:15:47.506
Sylvia!

1:15:47.756 --> 1:15:50.717
Please, please don't hurt me!

1:16:02.312 --> 1:16:03.689
You wanna get outta here?

1:16:13.866 --> 1:16:15.576
Where're we going?

1:16:17.953 --> 1:16:21.415
Police? You wanna go to the Police?
We can tell'm everything.

1:16:21.498 --> 1:16:23.250
I just wanna go to my mom.

1:16:25.502 --> 1:16:27.754
I think, she's in Portage.

1:16:31.466 --> 1:16:33.010
Damn it!

1:16:40.225 --> 1:16:42.352
- Ricky?
- Oh my God!

1:17:08.462 --> 1:17:10.506
I'll come with you.

1:17:10.881 --> 1:17:13.300
No, you gotta get back.

1:17:15.928 --> 1:17:20.140
You gotta get back to Jennie, and
make sure nothing happens to her.

1:17:22.809 --> 1:17:25.521
I wont let her out of my site.

1:17:26.730 --> 1:17:28.732
Thank you, Ricky.

1:18:12.860 --> 1:18:14.403
Daddy?

1:18:16.280 --> 1:18:18.156
Cookie?

1:18:18.365 --> 1:18:19.825
What're you doing here?

1:18:21.952 --> 1:18:25.038
Oh, my...
What happened to you?

1:18:34.423 --> 1:18:36.508
Oh, my God.

1:18:37.551 --> 1:18:39.595
Oh, my God.

1:18:43.932 --> 1:18:46.059
They did this to you?

1:18:49.646 --> 1:18:52.316
I'm so... so sorry.

1:18:52.691 --> 1:18:55.277
I'm just so sorry,
I left you there.

1:19:01.366 --> 1:19:03.368
We gotta go back.

1:19:06.038 --> 1:19:08.457
Let's just talk in the car.

1:19:08.582 --> 1:19:11.752
Everything's gonna be
taking care of, Cookie.

1:19:11.877 --> 1:19:14.171
You're with your family now.

1:19:14.546 --> 1:19:18.425
Oh, Honey.
Mama's here now.

1:19:24.139 --> 1:19:27.601
Hey, Honey! We're here.

1:19:41.365 --> 1:19:43.367
You stay here, Cookie.

1:19:47.246 --> 1:19:49.915
I gotta do this.

1:19:51.792 --> 1:19:54.169
I'm just gonna go in.

1:20:25.659 --> 1:20:28.203
She's not breathing, mama.

1:20:33.458 --> 1:20:34.793
Stephanie?

1:21:03.447 --> 1:21:05.741
Please, Sylvia, please breath.

1:21:12.581 --> 1:21:15.000
Shirley, she'll be okay,
she'll be okay.

1:21:21.089 --> 1:21:23.175
She just lays there.

1:21:26.720 --> 1:21:28.430
Look out!

1:21:28.722 --> 1:21:30.682
Here, try this.

1:21:50.285 --> 1:21:52.579
She's not dying!

1:21:59.461 --> 1:22:01.713
She's lying, baby, She's just...

1:22:13.475 --> 1:22:14.977
I need the police!

1:22:25.779 --> 1:22:27.406
She's dead.

1:22:27.656 --> 1:22:29.658
Jesus Christ, Gertie.

1:22:39.042 --> 1:22:40.794
What's the problem?

1:22:48.677 --> 1:22:51.013
Jennie, did you ever see...

1:22:55.809 --> 1:22:59.188
No. I didn't see anything.

1:22:59.771 --> 1:23:02.816
Did you ever see her
do anything, to Paula?

1:23:05.360 --> 1:23:08.530
Did you ever see her do anything,
to Johnny Baniszewski?

1:23:13.076 --> 1:23:18.499
Jennie, you saw your
sister being hit...

1:23:19.124 --> 1:23:21.210
beaten, struck.

1:23:24.421 --> 1:23:28.634
Well, huh... Gertie dreaded me,
that if I told anybody...

1:23:32.137 --> 1:23:35.265
You could have told anyone,
up and down on the street.

1:23:35.766 --> 1:23:40.187
I was scared, and I guess,
I just...

1:23:40.437 --> 1:23:44.483
did what she told me to do.
I wish, I hadn't.

1:23:49.279 --> 1:23:51.782
Did you ever see Sylvia cry?

1:23:58.580 --> 1:24:01.375
They said, she didn't
have any feelings...

1:24:05.796 --> 1:24:09.258
I've seen her cry before.

1:24:10.092 --> 1:24:14.555
I imagine, the reason
that she didn't cry, was...

1:24:20.185 --> 1:24:23.272
<i>The trial lasted 24 days.</i>

1:24:23.355 --> 1:24:26.567
Gertrude was the last
one to take the stand.

1:24:34.616 --> 1:24:37.244
Pretty run down, physically.

1:24:37.828 --> 1:24:40.330
Pretty upset, mentally and emotionally.

1:24:43.458 --> 1:24:47.254
If you got as many children...

1:24:47.462 --> 1:24:51.967
around your home,
all the time, as I do...

1:25:10.068 --> 1:25:14.448
<i>Well, then, getting to
the 1st, week of September.</i>

1:25:23.457 --> 1:25:25.375
No, Sir.

1:25:25.626 --> 1:25:27.377
<i>What about the 3rd. week
of September...</i>

1:25:39.306 --> 1:25:42.226
My children and the
neighbor children...

1:25:53.987 --> 1:25:57.115
I did not see this, fighting then.

1:25:57.324 --> 1:26:00.536
I was barely able to stay up at all.

1:26:04.706 --> 1:26:07.626
Did you have any knowledge,
of any mistreatment...

1:26:11.255 --> 1:26:13.423
No, Sir.

1:26:19.304 --> 1:26:21.515
No, Sir.

1:26:24.351 --> 1:26:26.019
No, Sir.

1:26:31.149 --> 1:26:33.402
No.

1:26:35.112 --> 1:26:37.614
Did you hear the testimony of Jennie?

1:26:38.073 --> 1:26:39.783
Yes, I did.

1:26:48.417 --> 1:26:50.169
Yes, I heard that.

1:26:50.294 --> 1:26:52.171
Did they all lie?

1:26:58.969 --> 1:27:01.221
That is right.

1:27:05.017 --> 1:27:07.352
No, Sir.

1:27:10.063 --> 1:27:12.566
Did you hear John Baniszewski state...

1:27:18.530 --> 1:27:20.616
Yes, I heard that statement.

1:27:27.539 --> 1:27:30.292
He was not telling the truth.

1:27:34.379 --> 1:27:37.216
You're saying, you did not do it?

1:27:38.175 --> 1:27:39.593
That's right.

1:27:52.356 --> 1:27:55.526
I imagine, he is a pretty
scared little boy.

1:27:59.488 --> 1:28:03.700
I've been scared by a lot
of things, for a long time.

1:28:04.535 --> 1:28:08.080
She sacrificed me,
to protect her children...

1:28:33.647 --> 1:28:35.983
Will the accused, please rise!

1:28:48.370 --> 1:28:51.707
We, the Jury, find
Gertrude Baniszewski...

1:29:05.846 --> 1:29:08.307
The case got a lot of attention...

1:29:09.683 --> 1:29:12.477
it even made Time Magazine.

1:29:18.233 --> 1:29:19.818
And most people started talking...

1:29:23.864 --> 1:29:25.115
Thank you.

1:29:35.542 --> 1:29:37.920
Johnny was convicted too.

1:29:47.679 --> 1:29:50.140
Ricky Hobbs, was found
guilty of man-slaughter...

1:29:58.607 --> 1:30:01.401
Coy, also served a couple of years...

1:30:01.568 --> 1:30:03.403
He went on with a life of crime...

1:30:06.406 --> 1:30:09.868
I don't know, what happened,
to any of the rest of them.

1:30:10.661 --> 1:30:12.621
Mom und Dad, went back on Tour...

1:30:21.630 --> 1:30:25.050
<i>Gertrude served 20 years
of her life sentence.</i>

1:30:29.596 --> 1:30:32.766
Before she died 5 years later...

1:30:50.784 --> 1:30:53.036
I'm so sorry.

1:31:03.755 --> 1:31:05.674
And me?

1:31:07.259 --> 1:31:10.220
I returned to the carnival.

1:31:10.679 --> 1:31:13.765
The only place, I always felt save.

1:31:16.727 --> 1:31:19.313
Reverend Bill, used to say:

1:31:25.485 --> 1:31:29.948
I guess, I'm still trying
to figure out, what that plan was.
