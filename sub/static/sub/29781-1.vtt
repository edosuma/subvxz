11:23.891 --> 11:24.850
[Kate sighs]

11:25.309 --> 11:26.227
[Kate] Oh.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.020
You're coming on this, too?

11:28.104 --> 11:28.938
Yup.

11:30.648 --> 11:32.191
But I thought it was supposed to be a...

11:32.274 --> 11:33.818
Luxury couples safari.

11:34.402 --> 11:35.778
Complete with air transport.

11:35.861 --> 11:36.862
[hollow knock]

11:37.071 --> 11:39.073
-Oh, you're the pilot.
-[Derek] For today.

11:40.533 --> 11:41.492
Who is Kirk?

11:41.867 --> 11:42.910
[Derek] Captain Kirk.

11:43.577 --> 11:44.745
From Star Trek.

11:46.038 --> 11:48.874
Because we do boldly go
where no tourist has gone before.

11:50.167 --> 11:51.001
Derek Holliston.

11:51.961 --> 11:55.131
Two L's, in case you want
to write my name down on a complaint form.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.883
-Okay.
-All right, Mrs. Conrad.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.510
-[suitcase wheels rattling]
-[Kate] Oh.

11:59.927 --> 12:01.637
[stammers] Oh, it's-- it's Ms. Conrad.

12:01.929 --> 12:03.180
You know, Kate's just fine.

12:03.806 --> 12:04.640
Kate.

12:05.474 --> 12:06.559
Is that short for Katherine?

12:06.642 --> 12:07.601
Just Kate.

12:09.645 --> 12:12.064
So I thought it was good luck
to name your plane after a woman.

12:12.606 --> 12:15.234
-Actually it's a woman you love.
-[belt rattles]

12:15.317 --> 12:17.611
Truth is, this one was already named
"Kira" when I got her,

12:17.695 --> 12:19.280
so I only had to paint over one letter.

12:20.531 --> 12:21.741
It's about a 40-minute flight.

12:21.866 --> 12:22.950
-[gear cranks]
-to the lodge.

12:23.033 --> 12:23.868
[engine rumbles]

12:23.951 --> 12:25.911
Don't let the name "lodge" fool you.

12:25.995 --> 12:27.788
You'll be surrounded by five-star luxury.

12:28.330 --> 12:29.415
-[cranking]
-Lusaka traffic,

12:29.498 --> 12:32.626
Cessna Mike India Alpha, East tie-down,
departing runway 35, Lusaka.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.128
[man over radio] Clear for takeoff.

12:34.253 --> 12:36.088
-[engine rumbling]
-[hopeful music playing]

12:48.184 --> 12:51.187
We're flying over the oldest and largest
game Reserve in Africa,

12:51.270 --> 12:52.438
home of the big five.

12:53.063 --> 12:55.775
Lion, leopard, rhino,
cape buffalo, elephant.

12:57.276 --> 12:59.445
Oh. Two o'clock, buffalo.

13:00.780 --> 13:01.655
[Kate] Wow.

13:02.114 --> 13:04.575
[Derek] Some people say it's the most
dangerous animal out here.

13:05.201 --> 13:06.202
But it's not.

13:07.870 --> 13:08.704
What is?

13:09.955 --> 13:10.790
We are.

13:12.124 --> 13:14.126
[hopeful music continuing]

13:15.961 --> 13:17.296
[plane engine wailing]

13:27.056 --> 13:28.057
Hang on a minute.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.558
I'm gonna make a stop.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.851
[engine roars]

13:31.227 --> 13:33.437
Wait, what? A stop? Where?

13:45.658 --> 13:47.034
[engine rumbling]

13:51.205 --> 13:52.581
[motor puttering]

13:56.669 --> 13:57.753
What are we doing?

13:58.295 --> 13:59.797
I need you to stay in the plane.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.174
Stay here? [stammers]
What if you don't come back?

14:02.258 --> 14:03.092
I'll come back.

14:05.928 --> 14:06.846
[birds trilling]

14:13.769 --> 14:15.145
[seat belt clicks, rattles]

14:18.983 --> 14:20.401
[birds chirping, cawing]

14:20.693 --> 14:22.152
[indistinct rumbling]

14:24.196 --> 14:25.614
[twittering, flapping]

14:27.700 --> 14:29.702
[buffalo grunting]

14:31.287 --> 14:32.913
[indistinct trilling]

14:47.386 --> 14:48.846
[elephant trumpeting in the distance]

14:49.013 --> 14:50.973
[mellow instrumentals]

14:52.141 --> 14:53.809
[insects croaking]

14:54.226 --> 14:56.687
[elephant groans, grumbles]

14:57.187 --> 14:59.064
-It's Derek. You read me?
-[man on walkie] Yes.

14:59.148 --> 15:02.192
We have an orphan five kilometers
southwest of N'goma.

15:02.276 --> 15:05.362
You'll find us just north of where
I landed the airplane. We'll need a truck.

15:05.487 --> 15:06.405
[walkie beeps]

15:06.655 --> 15:07.656
[hushed] What happened?

15:08.282 --> 15:09.116
Poachers.

15:09.199 --> 15:11.243
-[elephant wails]
-Killed the mama for tusks.

15:11.702 --> 15:14.622
If we don't do something to help
that baby, he'll be dead in two days.

15:14.705 --> 15:15.539
Take off your shirt.

15:16.040 --> 15:16.957
What?

15:17.625 --> 15:18.792
You wanna help or not?

15:20.669 --> 15:21.921
[elephant grumbles]

15:23.380 --> 15:25.007
I need you to talk to him,

15:25.090 --> 15:27.092
stay right in front of him,
keep his attention.

15:28.218 --> 15:30.012
-[groaning]
-Hey, hey!

15:30.095 --> 15:30.971
[trumpets]

15:31.430 --> 15:32.514
[Kate] It's gonna be okay.

15:33.432 --> 15:35.100
All right? Just be calm.

15:35.517 --> 15:36.602
It's gonna be all right.

15:36.685 --> 15:38.145
-[elephant brays]
-You're very brave.

15:38.228 --> 15:40.189
Don't be scared. Everything's fine.

15:41.106 --> 15:42.650
Everything's gonna be okay.

15:43.233 --> 15:44.401
[elephant trumpets]

15:44.485 --> 15:47.154
We gotta get him on his side,
so he doesn't charge us. I got this.

15:47.237 --> 15:48.614
-Let me help!
-I've got it.

15:48.697 --> 15:49.907
-[Kate] Oh!
-[grumbling]

15:49.990 --> 15:52.785
Okay. I'll keep him calm,
get some water out of my backpack.

15:52.868 --> 15:54.578
[Derek shushing]

15:57.539 --> 15:58.874
[tin clanking]

15:58.999 --> 15:59.833
It's okay.

16:02.044 --> 16:02.878
Here you go.

16:04.129 --> 16:05.798
[Kate] Here, baby. Drink up, sweetheart.

16:05.881 --> 16:07.633
-Let's wet down his ears.
-[elephant exhaling]

16:07.716 --> 16:09.426
He needs to know
that we're here to help him.

16:10.010 --> 16:12.888
-[grumbling]
-All this for ivory?

16:13.263 --> 16:16.266
Nobody in the world needs ivory,
except an elephant.

16:19.103 --> 16:22.815
[wildlife workers chanting in Nyanja]

16:25.192 --> 16:26.902
[worker] Okay! Slow, slow, slow!

16:27.361 --> 16:29.113
-[Kate] Careful, gentle!
-[worker] Going up.

16:29.613 --> 16:30.906
Is he okay?

16:31.407 --> 16:32.658
What's going to happen to him?

16:33.158 --> 16:35.619
We'll take him back to the shelter
and nurse him back to health.

16:36.286 --> 16:37.955
We didn't have great luck
with the last one,

16:38.038 --> 16:39.957
but he looks like
he's in a little better shape.

16:40.916 --> 16:41.750
All right.

16:42.501 --> 16:43.585
Let's get you to the lodge.

16:44.086 --> 16:46.338
[Derek] You'll be sipping martinis
before sunset.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.885
[mellow piano music playing]

16:53.262 --> 16:54.096
I'm going with him.

16:57.474 --> 16:59.685
Listen, I know this is very emotional,

16:59.768 --> 17:00.978
but there's nothing you can do.

17:01.395 --> 17:03.063
But I'm a vet!

17:03.147 --> 17:06.442
[stammers] I haven't practiced in a while,
and I mostly worked on dogs and cats,

17:06.775 --> 17:07.776
but I really want to help.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.486
What do you know about elephants?

17:10.571 --> 17:11.780
Almost nothing.

17:13.574 --> 17:14.408
[clicks tongue]

17:21.874 --> 17:22.750
Jonathan.

17:22.833 --> 17:23.667
Kate.

17:27.671 --> 17:28.672
[engine turns over]

17:29.631 --> 17:31.884
-[engine rumbling]
-Didn't see that one coming.

17:33.802 --> 17:35.804
[inspirational music playing]

17:54.823 --> 17:56.116
[truck bed squeaking]

17:58.243 --> 18:00.829
[Kate] It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be all right, little baby.

18:02.122 --> 18:02.956
Right?

18:12.257 --> 18:13.926
[trunk bed rattles]

18:16.095 --> 18:18.097
[inspirational music continues]

18:20.682 --> 18:22.059
[Jonathan] Yeah. Straight.

18:26.688 --> 18:28.315
[Kate] Is he gonna be okay?

18:28.774 --> 18:31.193
He's in shock.
The grief of losing his family.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.277
What can I do to help?

18:32.361 --> 18:35.197
We have to make sure
that he's hydrated and stays warm.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.115
Okay.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.955
[Jonathan] We'll get this
into his ear right here.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.165
-[grumbles]
-[Kate] Here's some tape.

18:45.249 --> 18:46.083
Tape...

18:48.168 --> 18:49.044
[Jonathan] Right.

18:50.629 --> 18:51.797
Should I open?

18:52.131 --> 18:52.965
Open.

18:53.048 --> 18:54.258
-Okay.
-[clicking]

18:58.220 --> 18:59.680
-[Kate] Is it going?
-[Jonathan] Yeah.

18:59.763 --> 19:01.765
If he doesn't get up in a day's time,

19:02.141 --> 19:03.392
he probably never will.

19:05.394 --> 19:06.603
[elephant grumbles]

19:08.605 --> 19:10.482
[cheery music playing]

19:14.278 --> 19:16.113
We try and replicate life in the herd.

19:16.196 --> 19:18.657
Each baby has a keeper,
making sure they are never alone.

19:19.366 --> 19:22.494
We also trade off, so the calves
don't get too attached to one person,

19:22.578 --> 19:23.912
and vice versa.

19:24.621 --> 19:26.582
When the elephants are ready
to leave the nursery,

19:26.665 --> 19:27.958
they spend their nights there,

19:28.041 --> 19:29.877
and at their own pace,

19:29.960 --> 19:32.588
which sometimes does take years,

19:32.671 --> 19:35.340
they gradually make the transition
back into the wild.

19:35.424 --> 19:36.800
And these are our living quarters,

19:36.884 --> 19:39.094
but most of us prefer
to sleep with the elephants.

19:39.261 --> 19:41.889
How do the older elephants
react to the babies you rescue?

19:43.265 --> 19:45.726
-I'll show you.
-[trumpeting in the distance]

19:46.602 --> 19:48.270
Kalama! Olare!

19:48.937 --> 19:49.771
Chuma!

19:49.938 --> 19:52.900
[elephants braying, chuffing]

19:53.650 --> 19:55.569
Right now we have three babies,

19:55.652 --> 19:57.946
four teenagers and three adults.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.406
-[trumpeting]
-Everybody!

19:59.489 --> 20:00.991
This is Dr. Kate.

20:01.491 --> 20:02.701
-Hello!
-Hi!

20:02.784 --> 20:03.619
Bwanji!

20:05.954 --> 20:07.372
[Jonathan] That is Chuma.

20:08.415 --> 20:10.542
She's practicing
to be a matriarch.

20:10.626 --> 20:13.045
-Wow.
-[keeper] Come on, Chuma! Move, move!

20:13.128 --> 20:16.298
-She's very curious and very bossy.
-[grumbling]

20:16.423 --> 20:19.384
[laughs] Well, Chuma,
you have some New York in you!

20:19.509 --> 20:21.845
[Jonathan] Elephants have all the emotions
of humans.

20:21.929 --> 20:24.056
A sense of humor and a sense of family.

20:24.723 --> 20:26.725
-The children want attention,
-[elephant vocalizing]

20:26.850 --> 20:28.227
and the teenagers rebel.

20:29.603 --> 20:32.189
Come. It's almost suppertime
for the little ones.

20:32.272 --> 20:33.106
Okay.

20:33.190 --> 20:34.983
[trumpeting]

20:40.280 --> 20:42.282
[cheery music continues]

20:45.160 --> 20:46.286
This is it.

20:47.579 --> 20:50.040
We feed the babies
separately from the adults.

20:50.415 --> 20:53.001
That's Kasewe. We rescued him last week.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.504
And that's Multisani.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.047
Oh, my gosh.

20:57.464 --> 20:58.548
Amazing.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.467
He's our oldest toddler.

21:00.550 --> 21:02.052
-Very demanding.
-[wailing]

21:02.135 --> 21:03.679
Why don't you get some rest?

21:03.762 --> 21:04.680
This way.

21:06.014 --> 21:07.766
The first tent on the end is yours,

21:07.849 --> 21:09.643
and we take supper in the boma.

21:15.816 --> 21:16.692
[relieving sigh]

21:25.325 --> 21:26.451
[zipping]

21:33.959 --> 21:34.793
[exhales]

21:40.257 --> 21:41.258
Hey, New York.

21:44.094 --> 21:44.928
Oh.

21:45.429 --> 21:46.388
Sorry,

21:46.847 --> 21:49.599
Jonathan said the tent on the end.

21:49.975 --> 21:50.809
The other end.

21:51.560 --> 21:52.644
This one's mine.

21:53.937 --> 21:54.813
You mean,

21:55.397 --> 21:57.316
you live here, like, all the time?

21:57.399 --> 21:59.568
Yeah, I fly the tourists
to help us pay for the plane.

22:00.902 --> 22:03.530
Oh, I put your suitcase in your tent.

22:03.989 --> 22:05.949
Forgive the mess.
I'm not very good at folding.

22:06.908 --> 22:09.244
Kinda opened up
when I threw it on the bed.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.413
-So you just went through my stuff?
-No.

22:11.788 --> 22:13.999
But I don't think you're gonna need
those high heels here.

22:15.208 --> 22:16.043
All right.

22:17.044 --> 22:18.628
Oh, zip the tent, please.

22:19.421 --> 22:20.964
I don't want any more visitors.

22:21.048 --> 22:22.341
I'm not coming back!

22:22.424 --> 22:23.717
-I meant the baboons.
-Oh.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.344
[South African woman] No, no, no, no.

22:25.427 --> 22:29.639
Tell him that Leslie Van Der Mere-Jones
called, exclamation point!

22:29.765 --> 22:31.391
[curious instrumentals]

22:33.643 --> 22:34.478
Hey.

22:38.940 --> 22:40.317
[zipping]

22:44.029 --> 22:44.905
[sighs]

22:47.115 --> 22:48.909
[hopeful instrumentals]

23:07.844 --> 23:08.678
Hey!

23:08.762 --> 23:09.596
Hey.

23:15.644 --> 23:17.938
-[Kate] These are beautiful!
-[Derek] Come on, grab a plate.

23:19.689 --> 23:20.941
[fork scraping]

23:23.235 --> 23:24.069
This is good!

23:24.319 --> 23:26.279
Great, 'cause we're having it tomorrow.

23:27.114 --> 23:28.198
And if you stay long enough,

23:28.281 --> 23:30.742
the day after that, the day after that,
and the day after that.

23:33.954 --> 23:34.955
[utensils clatter]

23:35.539 --> 23:36.415
Why'd you quit?

23:37.249 --> 23:38.083

But you found him.

47:53.120 --> 47:54.371
So it all worked out.

47:55.163 --> 47:57.916
Yeah, but there weren't
any poachers in that mall.

We will find them.
