<i>Previously on Transformers Prime:</i>

00:03.940 --> 00:06.150
If you don't survive, Optimus,

00:06.320 --> 00:08.320
I fear neither will this planet!

00:08.320 --> 00:09.820
No!!!

00:09.990 --> 00:10.780
What happened?

00:10.870 --> 00:12.070
Wasn't me.

00:12.120 --> 00:12.870
Me neither.

00:12.910 --> 00:14.200
<i>I happened!</i>

00:14.450 --> 00:16.160
Optimus! Our past alliances —

00:17.080 --> 00:18.920
Autobot, Decepticon — no longer matter,

00:20.790 --> 00:22.880
not while Unicron lives.

00:23.210 --> 00:26.300
I can lead you directly into Unicron's Spark.

00:26.380 --> 00:28.760
A truce between Autobot and Decepticon...

00:29.720 --> 00:32.390
Optimus!
How are we supposed to stop Unicron?

00:32.509 --> 00:34.640
With a Matrix of Leadership.

00:34.720 --> 00:37.520
It appears our Leader
has abandoned us.

00:37.680 --> 00:40.150
I believe we must consider
the possibility of a future

00:40.850 --> 00:43.190
without Megatron.

00:43.230 --> 00:48.450
Jack... I feel you have earned the responsibility
of safeguarding this important device.

00:48.740 --> 00:51.070
Until I return.

00:51.070 --> 00:53.240
So... how long before Unicron
knows we're here?

00:54.290 --> 00:58.000
Make no mistake...
he already does.

01:02.861 --> 01:04.456
Argh!

...Unicron grows ever stronger.

01:25.515 --> 01:29.070
How do we know Unicron isn't using
Megatron to lead us all into a trap?

01:29.312 --> 01:32.030
We do not.

- That is it!
- Where are you going?

02:58.910 --> 03:01.410
I can't just sit on my hands when
the world spins out of control.

03:01.700 --> 03:04.580
And what exactly is that
that you intend to do?

03:04.580 --> 03:06.000
Anything!

03:06.000 --> 03:07.460
Hook up with my boys at the Finnegan,

03:07.630 --> 03:10.250
figure out a way to bury
that monster for good!

03:10.371 --> 03:12.662
In the event Optimus can't?

03:12.682 --> 03:15.243
Don't you mean Optimus and Megatron?

03:15.510 --> 03:18.050
No one here is thrilled about
this arrangement, agent Fowler,

03:18.100 --> 03:19.890
myself included.

03:19.970 --> 03:22.270
But with Optimus and Megatron
together again...

03:22.730 --> 03:24.640
Wow, wait, again?

03:24.640 --> 03:28.150
- Megatron was an Autobot?
- Optimus was a 'Con?

03:28.190 --> 03:31.230
No, on either count.
But, there was a time,

03:31.400 --> 03:35.736
back on Cybertron, in the twilight
hours of the Golden age,

03:35.736 --> 03:39.531
when Optimus and Megatron
were not sworn enemies.

03:39.610 --> 03:42.660
<i>Do you recall when I mentioned
that Optimus wasn't always a Prime?</i>

03:42.780 --> 03:45.240
<i>And he wasn't always Optimus, either.</i>

03:45.240 --> 03:49.250
<i>He was once a clerk,
in the Iacon Hall of Records,</i>

03:49.290 --> 03:51.660
<i>named Orion Pax.</i>

03:52.580 --> 03:54.750
<i>But as he learned more
about Cybertron's past,</i>

03:55.380 --> 04:00.630
<i>he grew increasingly concerned
about the present corruption in high places,</i>

04:01.970 --> 04:04.550
<i>an inequality among the masses.</i>

04:05.100 --> 04:09.930
<i>Orion became inspired by the words
and ideas of a gladiator —</i>

04:11.060 --> 04:15.360
<i>one who had named himself after one
of the thirteen original Primes —</i>

04:15.900 --> 04:18.029
<i>Megatronus.</i>

04:18.190 --> 04:21.149
<i>Megatronus vowed to challenge
Cyberton's leadership</i>

04:21.529 --> 04:24.780
<i>and demand that all Cybertronians
be treated as equals.</i>

04:25.030 --> 04:29.000
<i>This gladiator turned revolutionary rapidly
to gather loyal following.</i>

04:29.870 --> 04:31.000
<i>Soundwave chief among them.</i>

04:34.500 --> 04:36.170
<i>Orion began corresponding
with Megatronus</i>

04:37.090 --> 04:39.800
<i>who came to be something
of the mentor to him.</i>

04:40.090 --> 04:43.470
<i>As Megatronus left the gladiatorial arena
for the political,</i>

04:43.470 --> 04:45.550
<i>he saw fit to shorten his name.</i>

04:47.220 --> 04:51.310
<i>Before long, Megatron appeared
before the High Council</i>

04:51.480 --> 04:55.440
<i>to propose his vision for a just society.</i>

04:55.440 --> 04:58.400
<i>And it was here that he began
to reveal his true colours —</i>

04:59.440 --> 05:02.950
<i>proclaiming the need to overthrow
the old Guard with force</i>

05:03.160 --> 05:06.620
<i>and arrogantly demanding to be
named the next Prime.</i>

05:06.660 --> 05:11.000
<i>But Orion did not believe in violence
as a means of achieving justice.</i>

05:11.460 --> 05:15.880
<i>The sparks and minds of the Council
were moved by Orion's words.</i>

05:16.630 --> 05:20.049
<i>Here, for the first time since
Cybertron's Golden age,</i>

05:20.050 --> 05:23.220
<i>stood someone worthy of being a Prime.</i>

05:23.220 --> 05:26.560
<i>But that honour could
only truly be achieved</i>

05:26.600 --> 05:29.980
<i>by earning the legendary
Matrix of leadership.</i>

05:30.770 --> 05:36.070
<i>His ambitions thwarted, Megatron spitefully severed
all ties with Orion and the Council,</i>

05:36.360 --> 05:40.440
<i>and came to wage war
on all who opposed him</i>

05:40.780 --> 05:45.830
<i>through his growing army of followers
which he named "Decepticons".</i>

05:46.910 --> 05:50.750
<i>He vowed to claim the Matrix for himself,
wherever it might lie.</i>

05:52.580 --> 05:55.840
<i>In time, warfare consumed Cybertron,</i>

05:56.500 --> 05:59.300
<i>poisoning the planet to its core.</i>

06:00.800 --> 06:02.260
<i>Orion journeyed there,</i>

06:02.550 --> 06:09.395
<i>hoping to reverse the ill effects and found himself
before the very Spark of our life-giver --</i>

06:09.480 --> 06:12.350
<i>Primus himself.</i>

06:12.350 --> 06:16.230
<i>The ailing Primus sensed the innate
nobility within Orion</i>

06:16.520 --> 06:21.490
<i>and bestowed the Matrix upon him.</i>

06:21.570 --> 06:24.700
<i>It was thus that the surprised
and humbled Orion Pax</i>

06:26.990 --> 06:30.285
<i>came to be Optimus,</i>

06:30.285 --> 06:33.880
the last of the Primes.

06:34.060 --> 06:37.209
So, Optimus got the Matrix from Cybertron's core,

06:37.209 --> 06:39.281
and now he's gonna give it to Earth's?

06:39.711 --> 06:43.280
What's to stop Megatron from just claiming
the Matrix for himself this time around?

06:43.440 --> 06:47.990
Only his greater desire to save this planet
so that he may in turn conquer it!

06:48.780 --> 06:50.580
As he so compellingly argued...

06:50.620 --> 06:55.080
Provided the Lord of the Decepticons
can ever be fully trusted.

07:01.510 --> 07:03.930
Unicron's Spark is near.

07:06.180 --> 07:08.480
After you.

07:17.840 --> 07:20.120
...I'm fine, Bee. Just... woozy.

07:20.197 --> 07:21.712
The dark energon.

07:21.712 --> 07:25.330
It's starting to affect him.
Steady, easy go Bulk.

07:30.750 --> 07:33.500
He is preparing to expel us.

07:56.385 --> 07:57.730
What are those things?

07:57.820 --> 07:59.990
As we are within Unicron's body,

07:59.990 --> 08:03.160
it stands to reason they are
some sort of antibody.

09:09.180 --> 09:10.770
Bee! Let me go!

09:10.770 --> 09:13.360
I'll only take you down with me!

09:46.930 --> 09:48.430
Just let go, kid!

09:49.640 --> 09:51.480
Bulkhead!

09:55.940 --> 09:58.110
I got you.

10:05.780 --> 10:08.160
Arcee?

10:33.910 --> 10:35.370
Fellow Decepticons!

10:35.530 --> 10:39.700
While our loyalty to Megatron's command
has always remained steadfast,

10:40.370 --> 10:44.670
our Leader recent behaviour
has been questionable at best.

10:44.830 --> 10:49.630
And it would seem as though Earth has become
nothing short of a failed experiment.

10:49.880 --> 10:51.800
Commander Airachnid!

10:51.880 --> 10:56.560
You're not suggesting that we
abandon Lord Megatron?

10:56.640 --> 11:01.230
Despite Soundwave's efforts we have
been unable to detect our Master's signal.

11:01.890 --> 11:05.770
Megatron is either permanently offlined,
or in the thrall of Unicron.

11:06.770 --> 11:09.820
Neither is in the best interest
of the Decepticons.

11:10.150 --> 11:14.820
So I am deeming an exodus to be
the most prudent course of action.

11:14.990 --> 11:18.240
Unless anyone has a problem with that.

11:22.089 --> 11:25.840
Set course for Regulon 4.

11:30.300 --> 11:33.010
You have something to say, Soundwave?

11:36.978 --> 11:41.176
I command this vessel.
You will resume your post.

11:45.228 --> 11:47.609
Step aside!

11:59.210 --> 12:00.260
Ooh.

12:06.780 --> 12:10.050
I'll tear out your Spark for that!

12:23.190 --> 12:25.770
I yield.

12:30.570 --> 12:33.290
Watch out for the quiet ones.

12:37.320 --> 12:40.238
Communication links are down
as expected.

12:40.280 --> 12:42.200
But we've lost their signal.

12:42.530 --> 12:43.530
Doesn't that mean?..

12:43.700 --> 12:47.330
Usually. But the more likely explanation would
be the severe interference caused

12:47.370 --> 12:49.920
by these electromagnetic anomalies.

12:50.080 --> 12:53.540
So, if we can't track them and
they can't contact us...

12:53.630 --> 12:55.920
How are we gonna know
they are ready for pickup?

12:59.720 --> 13:01.890
Where did you get that?

13:02.010 --> 13:03.220
Optimus...

13:03.350 --> 13:06.672
Honestly, I don't know why he gave me
the key to the ground-bridge power supply.

13:06.680 --> 13:10.268
Jack. There is no key
to the ground-bridge.

13:10.810 --> 13:13.150
What, then... What is this?

13:14.520 --> 13:17.030
That is the key to Vector Sigma.

13:17.820 --> 13:19.530
The what?!

13:19.700 --> 13:22.950
You are holding one of Cybertron's
most important relics.

13:23.740 --> 13:25.790
I... I shouldn't have this.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.580
Optimus entrusted it to you, Jack.

13:28.620 --> 13:31.750
But that doesn't make
any sense... why?

13:31.880 --> 13:35.130
Because he doesn't plan
on coming back.

13:59.860 --> 14:02.510
<i>Megatron! Do as I command!</i>

14:05.850 --> 14:09.190
<i>Destroy the Prime!</i>

14:12.360 --> 14:13.570
Megatron!

14:20.700 --> 14:24.910
Unicron's Spark lies just beyond!

14:26.790 --> 14:28.330
How do we get inside?

14:28.870 --> 14:33.281
By fooling Unicron's defences into
believing we're not a threat.

14:45.430 --> 14:46.890
Autobots!

14:46.980 --> 14:50.770
I would need you to keep our attackers
at bay for as long as you can.

14:59.570 --> 15:01.120
We've got a full fest!

15:01.240 --> 15:02.910
For Optimus!

15:20.470 --> 15:22.797
Optimus... Swiftly!

15:34.830 --> 15:36.630
<i>Megatron!</i>

15:41.880 --> 15:46.390
<i>Destroy the Prime!
I command you!</i>

16:12.604 --> 16:16.439
Megatron is commanded
by no one!

16:31.420 --> 16:33.920
Earthquake! Take cover!

16:44.100 --> 16:49.020
Matrix of Leadership!
I call upon you!

16:53.230 --> 16:55.610
<i>You cannot defeat me, disciple of Primus!</i>

16:56.650 --> 16:58.990
<i>I have transcended physical being!</i>

17:00.200 --> 17:04.829
<i>By my will alone all upon this
world shall fall into chaos!</i>

17:07.000 --> 17:09.750
Not while I still function, Unicron!

17:10.960 --> 17:14.710
The power of the Matrix will
light our darkest hour!

17:15.010 --> 17:17.805
<i>Nooo!</i>

18:17.350 --> 18:19.470
There could be aftershocks.

18:21.940 --> 18:23.270
Do you think?

18:23.310 --> 18:25.360
I do.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.570
- Yes!
- Whee!

18:30.570 --> 18:32.820
- Oh yeah!
- Yes!

18:33.410 --> 18:36.830
Oh!  He-he.

18:55.650 --> 18:57.490
Teamwork. Hm!

19:06.720 --> 19:09.770
Where are we, Megatronus?

19:18.360 --> 19:20.820
Don't you remember, old friend?

19:23.700 --> 19:26.080
Optimus! Are you okay?

19:26.120 --> 19:29.160
Why did he call me that?

19:30.409 --> 19:32.103
What did you do to him?

19:32.536 --> 19:34.250
Who are they?

19:36.305 --> 19:38.310
Our mortal enemies!

19:39.134 --> 19:41.458
We're outnumbered.
Go! I'll cover you!

20:20.900 --> 20:22.158
Arcee!

20:22.158 --> 20:24.620
Ah! Oh, I was worried, Bulk!

20:24.660 --> 20:26.580
You alright, Bee?

20:26.710 --> 20:29.210
And Optimus? Is he...?

20:30.090 --> 20:32.170
Dead? No.

20:32.170 --> 20:35.090
But he looked right at us
without recognising us.

20:35.130 --> 20:38.090
Didn't even know his own name!

20:39.970 --> 20:43.140
When Optimus surrendered
the Matrix of Leadership,

20:43.220 --> 20:45.940
he lost more than the
collective wisdom of the Primes.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.519
He lost his own memories.

21:01.444 --> 21:03.783
Welcome back, Lord Megatron.

21:10.230 --> 21:12.569
At ease, Breakdown.

21:12.668 --> 21:16.950
That is no way to welcome
our long lost comrade.

21:20.216 --> 21:23.891
Orion Pax
is one of us.
