00:57.680 --> 00:59.238
I remember.

01:00.360 --> 01:02.351
I remember everything.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.911
Captain Webb.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.069
Good morning.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.994
Has everything
been explained to you?

01:13.440 --> 01:14.440
Yes, sir.

01:15.840 --> 01:19.674
When we are finished with you,
you will no longer be David Webb.

01:20.160 --> 01:21.991
I'll be whoever
you need me to be, sir.

01:23.840 --> 01:26.070
You knew exactly
what it meant for you

01:26.640 --> 01:28.392
if you chose to stay.

01:30.520 --> 01:32.636
You can't outrun
what you did, Jason.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.916
You made yourself
into who you are.

01:37.520 --> 01:40.592
Eventually you're gonna
have to face the fact.

01:41.920 --> 01:43.797
You volunteered.

04:25.400 --> 04:27.834
Christian Dassault
made a reservation.

05:37.240 --> 05:38.275
Heather Lee.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.470
Ma'am,
we have a device

05:40.600 --> 05:43.558
issued to a stay-behind team
in Novosibirsk, Russia, in 1993.

05:43.920 --> 05:46.275
Marked on our
inventory as destroyed.

05:46.560 --> 05:48.915
It's knocking on
our front door.

06:16.160 --> 06:17.275
What's the status?

06:17.480 --> 06:19.516
Whoever it is,
is just sitting there idle.

06:23.920 --> 06:25.751
There's no
outbound traffic, nothing.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.120
Move.

06:35.600 --> 06:37.192
They've found a back door.

06:37.280 --> 06:39.953
We need the reverse shell.
I'm gonna locate the source.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.040
I'm working on it.

06:41.160 --> 06:44.118
Okay, people, we have a major
breach of our classified mainframe.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.236
Drop everything you're doing,
get on it right now!

07:12.840 --> 07:14.592
Ma'am, I'm sending you
the shell.

07:14.680 --> 07:16.796
Got it.

07:16.880 --> 07:18.438
- Need it right now?
- Yeah.

07:18.520 --> 07:20.016
- Getting IP.
- Where's that traceroute?

07:20.040 --> 07:21.632
Unknown user. Monitoring.

07:23.680 --> 07:25.477
Reykjavik.

07:27.200 --> 07:28.474
SecOps hacking camp.

07:28.560 --> 07:29.788
Kill the power
to the building.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.456
Get into that power grid now.

07:31.480 --> 07:32.520
Yes, sir.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.176
I've got the power
to the building.

07:45.200 --> 07:46.235
Stand by.

07:47.160 --> 07:48.912
Ten seconds.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.240
Let's get
on top of this.

07:51.880 --> 07:54.240
- Shut it down.
- Copy that. Shutting it down.

08:34.559 --> 08:35.559
Dewey.

08:36.280 --> 08:37.918
We've just been hacked.

08:38.280 --> 08:39.508
How badly?

08:39.600 --> 08:41.238
Could be worse
than Snowden.

08:41.919 --> 08:43.433
Is there any attribution?

08:43.559 --> 08:44.629
We're working on it.

08:44.720 --> 08:47.917
Lee says it must be someone with
a deep knowledge of our systems.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.673
This could affect Deep Dream,
and Iron Hand.

08:51.360 --> 08:56.559
I want a briefing in my
conference room in one hour.

09:06.120 --> 09:07.120
Yes.

09:08.480 --> 09:11.358
Did you get confirmation?
Yeah, there was a hack.

09:11.800 --> 09:13.279
So are we exposed?

09:13.360 --> 09:15.191
We don't know yet.
We're checking.

09:15.320 --> 09:16.896
I want you to call Dewey.
Set up a meet in DC.

09:16.920 --> 09:18.136
Aaron, we got a lot
at stake here,

09:18.160 --> 09:19.176
maybe we shouldn't
rock the boat.

09:19.200 --> 09:20.474
Just do it.

09:22.920 --> 09:25.480
Hey, George.
We ready for the launch?

10:32.360 --> 10:35.079
Heather, you know the Director
of National Intelligence?

10:35.160 --> 10:37.037
Heather Lee,
Cyber Ops, sir.

10:38.240 --> 10:39.593
Have you got
a name for us?

10:39.680 --> 10:42.035
The hacker was
a former Agency operative.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.355
Believed to be working
with Christian Dassault,

10:45.440 --> 10:47.795
and previously
linked to Jason Bourne.

10:49.400 --> 10:50.549
Bourne?

10:51.200 --> 10:53.156
Jesus Christ.
What did they get?

10:53.680 --> 10:55.033
Black-ops files.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.793
From Treadstone
all the way to Iron Hand.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.357
Iron Hand?

11:00.440 --> 11:03.477
But that's not even operational yet,
for Christ's sakes.

11:03.600 --> 11:06.319
Where is Nicky Parsons
right now?

11:06.600 --> 11:07.999
On the move.

11:08.080 --> 11:10.594
She left Reykjavik,
traveling through Bucharest to Athens.

11:12.080 --> 11:13.638
Feels like a meet to me.

11:15.560 --> 11:17.000
Well, how are you
going to handle it?

11:19.720 --> 11:21.915
We cut the head
off this thing.

11:26.720 --> 11:29.678
Sir, I'd like to be
point on this operation.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.674
You're not indoctrinated
for this material.

11:35.760 --> 11:37.034
I'm already into it.

11:37.120 --> 11:38.997
I embedded malware
into Parsons' download.

11:39.760 --> 11:42.354
When those files are opened,
I can trace them.

11:43.320 --> 11:44.799
Let me in.

11:46.320 --> 11:48.709
I'll deliver Parsons,
the files,

11:48.800 --> 11:51.792
and, if he's out there,
I'll give you Bourne, too.

11:59.800 --> 12:00.949
Excuse me.

12:07.120 --> 12:08.838
I appreciate
your enthusiasm,

12:09.800 --> 12:14.271
but do not push your personal
agenda to the DNI again.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.279
Understood.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.828
All right.
I think you can help me.

12:19.320 --> 12:22.118
I'm going to give you full
operational control on this,

12:22.440 --> 12:24.078
and I will make
sure you have access

12:24.160 --> 12:26.549
to any relevant
teams and resources.

12:26.680 --> 12:30.229
And I want to know
every move you make.

12:30.720 --> 12:31.720
Yes, sir.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.152
Thank you very much, sir.

13:00.880 --> 13:01.880
Yeah?

13:02.040 --> 13:03.632
I need your help, now.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.757
I'm not finished here.

13:07.080 --> 13:09.150
Jason Bourne is in play.

13:11.640 --> 13:13.596
Where?
Athens.

13:13.680 --> 13:15.989
Close your account in Rome.

13:16.760 --> 13:18.159
Understood.

16:30.920 --> 16:32.797
Lee got a hit
from a CCTV feed.

16:32.880 --> 16:35.474
Parsons boarded a bus a half-hour ago,
headed west across Athens.

16:35.560 --> 16:37.152
I got two local
teams en route.

16:37.240 --> 16:39.629
Any sign of Bourne?
Not so far.

16:39.720 --> 16:42.393
He's involved in this somehow.
I can feel it.

16:44.360 --> 16:46.590
Upload all
Athens data and feeds,

16:46.960 --> 16:48.837
and activate
real-time processing.

16:48.960 --> 16:49.960
Copy that.

16:52.080 --> 16:53.308
Where are we?

16:54.240 --> 16:56.879
Parsons' bus has just
arrived at Syntagma Square.

16:57.360 --> 16:59.999
There's a demonstration in front
of the Greek parliament building.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.439
I think she'll
use it as cover.

17:01.920 --> 17:04.115
Deploy Alpha and Bravo
to the square.

17:04.640 --> 17:07.200
Recon for Parsons in the
crowd outside parliament,

17:07.280 --> 17:09.236
and any possible
rendezvous points.

17:09.400 --> 17:10.469
Copy that, sir.

17:10.640 --> 17:12.550
Sir, the Asset
has landed.

17:45.160 --> 17:46.434
Alpha Team arriving now.

17:46.880 --> 17:47.915
Copy that.

18:18.320 --> 18:19.958
I have
the Alpha Team feeds.

18:20.040 --> 18:21.189
Pull them up.

18:46.240 --> 18:49.277
Athens police are reporting tactical
teams moving on the demonstrators.

18:49.360 --> 18:51.954
Isolate all social-media
posts from the square.

18:52.040 --> 18:53.109
Yes, ma'am.

19:21.280 --> 19:22.793
Rewind Alpha One's feed.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.911
Yes, ma'am.
Twenty seconds.

19:25.240 --> 19:27.117
All right,
Bravo Two, Four, moving in.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.713
What's wrong?

19:42.440 --> 19:43.475
I hacked the Agency.

19:44.360 --> 19:45.998
For Christian Dassault.

19:46.120 --> 19:47.394
I got all
the black-ops files.

19:47.560 --> 19:49.118
We're putting them online.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.319
We need to move.

19:54.600 --> 19:55.600
Stop.

19:57.040 --> 19:58.040
Two seconds forward.

19:58.400 --> 19:59.515
Blonde hair.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Enhance.

20:09.240 --> 20:10.389
Find her.

20:14.160 --> 20:17.550
Nicky Parsons sighted in
Syntagma Square. Redirect south on Stadiou.

20:17.640 --> 20:20.598
I told you, Christian Dassault
is going to get you killed.

20:20.680 --> 20:22.238
We don't have
a choice, Jason.

20:22.320 --> 20:24.629
It's started again.
A new program.

20:24.760 --> 20:26.478
Iron Hand.
It's even worse than before.

20:26.560 --> 20:28.198
What's that got to do
with me?

20:28.280 --> 20:30.316
Because it matters.
It matters.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.072
Not to me, it doesn't.

20:32.400 --> 20:33.958
All that matters
is staying alive.

20:34.040 --> 20:36.395
You get off the grid,
survive.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.755
I don't believe that
and neither do you.

20:38.880 --> 20:40.836
Look at yourself.

20:40.960 --> 20:42.791
Look at what
you're doing.

20:42.880 --> 20:45.394
You can't live like
this for much longer.

20:47.480 --> 20:50.870
Jason, I came here because
I found something.

20:50.960 --> 20:53.235
I found your father's name
in the Treadstone files.

20:53.680 --> 20:54.999
He was an analyst.

20:55.080 --> 20:57.753
He wasn't in Operations.
He wasn't near any of that stuff.

20:57.840 --> 21:01.628
I'm telling you what I saw.
It looked like he was involved directly.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.513
And there's more.

21:03.600 --> 21:04.635
More about you.

21:04.720 --> 21:05.720
What do you mean?

21:06.320 --> 21:09.517
Before you joined the program,
they were watching you.

21:09.640 --> 21:11.551
Watching me?

21:12.200 --> 21:14.395
You've tortured yourself
for a long time now, Jason.

21:15.480 --> 21:18.119
You torture yourself
for what you've done.

21:18.200 --> 21:20.953
But you don't know the truth
about what they did to you.

21:21.040 --> 21:23.315
You need to
read those files.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.397
Move.
They tracked you.

21:34.320 --> 21:37.835
Alpha One has eyes on two targets.
One female, one male.

21:37.920 --> 21:38.920
Identify the male.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.115
Copy that, sir.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.475
Alpha One, we need an ID
on the male target.

21:42.880 --> 21:43.960
We've got to get
out of here

21:44.040 --> 21:46.395
before the police cut off
this part of the city.

21:51.800 --> 21:52.800
Head north.

21:54.240 --> 21:55.514
Meet me at
the statue of Athena.

21:56.680 --> 21:58.272
I'll take them with me.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.319
That's him.

22:07.240 --> 22:08.240
Now.

22:14.080 --> 22:16.275
Stay with Bourne.

22:16.360 --> 22:18.476
Clear to engage the target.

22:18.560 --> 22:19.595
Copy.

22:19.680 --> 22:21.910
Alpha Team, stay with the male.
You are clear to engage.

22:46.200 --> 22:47.349
Come on.

23:23.960 --> 23:25.996
Sir, Alpha Team comms
are down.

23:26.080 --> 23:27.680
We've lost him, sir.
He's taken them out.

23:29.480 --> 23:32.153
Find Parsons.
He'll come back to get her.

23:32.240 --> 23:33.309
Sir, rioting is spreading.

23:33.400 --> 23:36.437
The Greek government is
declaring a state of emergency.

23:40.080 --> 23:42.280
Bravo Team,
we are retargeting Parsons.

24:37.880 --> 24:39.871
We got her.

24:42.200 --> 24:43.872
Split the team,
put her in a box.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.958
A suspect matching Bourne's description
has stolen a police motorcycle.

26:10.120 --> 26:11.599
He's coming for Parsons.

26:11.680 --> 26:12.795
Where the hell
is the Asset?

26:12.880 --> 26:13.949
Two minutes out, sir.

26:46.920 --> 26:48.592
Parsons is at
the statue of Athena.

26:48.680 --> 26:49.680
Copy that.

27:13.920 --> 27:15.433
Bravo Team is down.

27:15.560 --> 27:17.391
Sir, the Asset is
arriving on scene.

27:17.480 --> 27:18.776
- Pull up the dash cam.
- Copy.

27:18.800 --> 27:21.030
Give me the feed and
direct comms to the Asset.

27:28.600 --> 27:30.192
Engaging targets.

27:46.760 --> 27:49.228
I'm accessing Athens
police tactical data.

27:49.360 --> 27:50.509
I need eyes overhead.

27:50.600 --> 27:52.192
Bring up
the satellite suite.

27:52.280 --> 27:55.192
Sir, I'm showing a Misty and
a KH-12 satellite available.

27:55.280 --> 27:57.077
Light up the 12.
Yes, sir.

28:10.080 --> 28:11.513
Satellite video
feed is online.

28:15.240 --> 28:17.080
Police have blocked
the road to the north.

28:17.120 --> 28:19.270
The target will be
forced to turn left.

28:32.800 --> 28:34.711
Another barricade
in 200 meters.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.711
Target turning left again.

28:48.680 --> 28:49.880
Bourne's heading
for the alley.

28:50.280 --> 28:51.679
Left at the top
of the hill.

29:24.600 --> 29:25.600
Stairway.

29:25.680 --> 29:27.398
Up the hill. Heading east.

29:27.520 --> 29:28.999
Give me a strike point.

29:29.120 --> 29:30.599
He's found a way out.

29:30.680 --> 29:32.352
Two hundred meters
to your left.

29:32.440 --> 29:34.829
19 Solomou.
Get to the roof.

29:35.760 --> 29:37.456
Target should pass
within your line of sight.

29:37.480 --> 29:39.152
19 Solomou. Copy.

29:47.440 --> 29:49.635
Focus the satellites
on these coordinates.

29:49.720 --> 29:51.696
And give me a lock on the
motorcycle when it gets there.

29:51.720 --> 29:52.755
Copy that.

30:19.360 --> 30:21.760
I've got the targets.
They're approaching Omonia from Fidiou.

30:22.960 --> 30:24.279
Look west.

30:24.360 --> 30:25.509
The long boulevard.

30:26.120 --> 30:28.395
Coming at you
in 55 seconds.

30:28.480 --> 30:29.833
Copy that.

30:53.840 --> 30:55.398
The Asset is online.

31:08.480 --> 31:10.118
Target's with you
in 15 seconds.

31:18.640 --> 31:20.119
Five seconds.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.069
Contact.

31:28.160 --> 31:29.229
Stay low!

31:33.960 --> 31:35.313
Find a shot.

31:38.680 --> 31:39.715
Hold on!

31:56.200 --> 31:57.792
Targets are down.

32:17.680 --> 32:18.680
Where's Bourne?

32:18.760 --> 32:20.113
Ma'am, a police helicopter
spotted

32:20.200 --> 32:21.536
three bodies on
the roof near the Asset.

32:21.560 --> 32:23.312
A tactical team's
on its way.

32:32.360 --> 32:33.395
Nicky?

32:47.240 --> 32:48.309
Don't move!

32:57.880 --> 32:59.950
Athens police have
entered the building.

33:00.080 --> 33:02.719
Asset, you need to
get out of there.

33:02.800 --> 33:04.074
Negative.

33:06.440 --> 33:08.431
We don't even know
if Bourne's alive.

33:09.840 --> 33:11.398
You want to
lose this guy?

33:16.800 --> 33:17.869
This is Director Dewey.

33:17.960 --> 33:19.632
You have 20 seconds.

33:24.960 --> 33:26.393
Hold on, Nicky.

33:27.480 --> 33:29.391
I'm going to
get you to cover.

33:30.720 --> 33:31.789
No.

33:37.320 --> 33:38.389
No.

33:40.400 --> 33:42.356
No, don't.

33:45.800 --> 33:47.074
I'm coming.

34:45.120 --> 34:47.350
Get a location on Christian Dassault.
Yes, sir.

34:47.520 --> 34:49.496
If he was working with Nicky Parsons,

34:49.520 --> 34:51.317
he will lead us
to Jason Bourne.

34:51.480 --> 34:53.994
And let me know if you get
a hit on that malware.

34:54.639 --> 34:56.152
Sir, can I clarify
one thing?

34:56.960 --> 34:57.960
Yeah.

34:58.680 --> 35:00.671
Does the Asset
know Bourne?

35:01.280 --> 35:03.271
Why would you
ask me that?

35:03.360 --> 35:04.839
His behavior
on the rooftop.

35:05.920 --> 35:07.911
It suggested a connection.

35:09.360 --> 35:11.191
The last time
Bourne came back,

35:11.280 --> 35:13.032
he exposed
the Blackbriar program.

35:13.760 --> 35:16.320
It compromised
active operations.

35:16.680 --> 35:19.513
The Asset was
in Syria undercover.

35:20.800 --> 35:22.028
He was captured, tortured,

35:22.120 --> 35:25.351
and it took two damn
years to get him out.

35:26.960 --> 35:29.554
So you think that's why
Bourne wants the files?

35:29.640 --> 35:30.868
To go public again?

35:30.960 --> 35:32.632
I have no idea
why he came back.

35:32.720 --> 35:34.631
But whatever he's doing,
he wants to destroy us.

35:34.720 --> 35:35.789
We can't let that happen.

35:37.520 --> 35:41.069
So, you give me a call
soon as you hear anything.

35:42.560 --> 35:43.754
Yes, sir.

38:36.560 --> 38:39.711
And now, the
founder and chairman of Deep Dream,

38:39.800 --> 38:42.234
Aaron Kalloor.

38:43.400 --> 38:44.400
Hi.

38:49.680 --> 38:50.680
Uh...

38:51.000 --> 38:52.080
You all know
why we're here.

38:52.120 --> 38:53.917
We're gonna be
unveiling a new platform.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.116
We think it is
a bold new step

38:56.200 --> 38:57.840
to allow us to serve
our community better.

38:58.080 --> 39:01.436
We're a community right now that is
transcending national boundaries.

39:01.520 --> 39:04.432
And I think we're
1.5 billion users.

39:12.600 --> 39:15.637
In a nutshell, as you know,
we have an ecosystem

39:15.720 --> 39:18.518
of hundreds of thousands
of apps at this point.

39:18.600 --> 39:20.397
And what this
new platform will do

39:20.480 --> 39:23.950
will be to integrate users'
data and preferences,

39:24.040 --> 39:26.110
and use that information

39:26.200 --> 39:30.159
to enrich and tailor-make
each unique user experience

39:30.240 --> 39:32.629
in a way that is,
frankly, unprecedented.

39:32.800 --> 39:35.473
Um, now, I can see some
journalists' pens twitching,

39:35.640 --> 39:37.949
- ready to ask about privacy.
- Yeah.

39:38.040 --> 39:40.349
This is a concern to many people,
and so it should be.

39:40.480 --> 39:42.096
I mean, this is something
that matters to us.

39:42.120 --> 39:44.111
And let me just say, uh,

39:44.200 --> 39:47.078
I understand nobody wants to
feel like they're being watched.

39:47.280 --> 39:48.315
So let me just tell you,

39:48.400 --> 39:51.312
when you come to Deep Dream,
when you use our service,

39:51.400 --> 39:53.152
no one
will be watching you.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.960
- Mr. Kalloor.
- Right this way, sir.

40:22.480 --> 40:23.754
Enjoy your meal.

40:23.840 --> 40:24.955
Thank you.

40:27.360 --> 40:28.600
Congratulations.

40:28.680 --> 40:31.200
I hear your stockholders were very
happy with that new platform.

40:31.520 --> 40:33.511
And I heard
you got hacked.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.752
We're dealing with it.

40:36.840 --> 40:39.957
This changes everything.
There's too much risk.

40:40.520 --> 40:41.589
I'm out.

40:41.760 --> 40:42.988
Aaron,

40:44.320 --> 40:47.392
you are an extraordinarily
gifted and perceptive young man.

40:47.520 --> 40:48.953
When you agreed
to help us,

40:49.040 --> 40:53.033
it was because you understood
the very grave threats that...

41:00.840 --> 41:03.016
Do you have any idea of the
shit-storm I'll have on my hands

41:03.040 --> 41:05.190
if this arrangement
becomes public?

41:06.240 --> 41:08.754
I already took a hit with Snowden,
and you want more?

41:08.960 --> 41:11.713
Our enemies have become
much more sophisticated.

41:11.960 --> 41:14.315
Gathering metadata
is no longer adequate.

41:14.400 --> 41:16.960
We need a back door
into your new platform,

41:17.040 --> 41:18.758
and a way past
the encryptions.

41:18.840 --> 41:21.195
And when that's not enough,
you'll want something new.

41:22.240 --> 41:24.390
You don't get it,
do you?

41:24.880 --> 41:27.792
Privacy is freedom.

41:27.920 --> 41:30.120
Maybe that's something you
should think about defending.

41:30.320 --> 41:32.456
You little prick, you didn't
believe in privacy or freedom

41:32.480 --> 41:35.074
when we funded your startup,
turned you into a billionaire.

41:35.160 --> 41:37.674
I paid you back
many, many, many times over.

41:38.080 --> 41:40.150
And I was never comfortable
with any of this.

41:40.680 --> 41:41.874
I'm out.

41:43.680 --> 41:45.113
I'm done selling
out our customers.

41:45.200 --> 41:46.918
But you would sell
out your country.

41:48.160 --> 41:50.993
The truth is, we wouldn't
be having this conversation

41:51.080 --> 41:54.277
if you didn't feel
personally at risk.

41:54.360 --> 41:55.793
You talk about
a free Internet,

41:55.880 --> 41:57.677
you tell yourself
you're saving the world,

41:57.760 --> 41:59.040
but all you're
doing is making it

41:59.160 --> 42:00.593
a much more
dangerous place.

42:00.720 --> 42:02.870
And you're sure as
hell making this country

42:02.960 --> 42:05.269
much more difficult
to defend.

42:05.360 --> 42:08.955
And you're sure as hell
accountable for that, Aaron.

42:11.440 --> 42:12.953
Accountable.

44:34.080 --> 44:35.433
Bourne?

44:35.600 --> 44:37.909
Everything on the table.

44:54.080 --> 44:55.229
Open it.

45:00.800 --> 45:01.949
Sure.

45:35.800 --> 45:37.200
Bourne has surfaced.

45:37.640 --> 45:38.640
In Berlin.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.228
Get the Berlin team up.

45:53.320 --> 45:54.594
Where is she?

45:54.920 --> 45:56.751
She's dead.

46:00.640 --> 46:01.640
She knew the risks.

46:03.280 --> 46:04.793
I warned her.

46:05.680 --> 46:07.238
She made a choice.

46:07.760 --> 46:09.796
You exploited her.

46:27.360 --> 46:28.509
Berlin team is mobile.

46:28.720 --> 46:30.392
What do we have
on the location?

46:30.480 --> 46:32.240
It's an address linked
to Christian Dassault.

46:32.360 --> 46:33.395
Anything on Bourne?

46:33.480 --> 46:36.677
Nothing yet.
I'm accessing CCTV now.

46:38.040 --> 46:41.715
Sir, I've been thinking,
maybe we've got this wrong.

46:42.720 --> 46:44.870
What if he's
not coming for us?

46:45.720 --> 46:47.039
What if it's something
else?

46:49.240 --> 46:51.834
You don't have any idea
who you're dealing with.

47:03.040 --> 47:04.393
We should
work together, Bourne.

47:05.640 --> 47:07.835
You exposed
the Blackbriar program.

47:09.440 --> 47:12.318
We're both after
the same thing, right?

47:12.400 --> 47:16.234
We both want to take down the corrupt
institutions that control society.

47:17.560 --> 47:19.471
I'm not on your side.

47:36.520 --> 47:38.272
CCTV feed is online.

47:42.040 --> 47:43.598
He's on a computer.

47:43.680 --> 47:45.910
We have to stop this.

47:46.000 --> 47:47.194
If he puts
those files online,

47:47.280 --> 47:49.032
operations
will be compromised

47:49.120 --> 47:50.235
and people will die.

47:50.320 --> 47:51.548
Yes, sir.

47:56.760 --> 47:59.274
At least when you're done,
leave me the files.

48:00.120 --> 48:02.554
These programs
have to be exposed.

48:03.600 --> 48:05.511
People have
a right to know.

48:22.400 --> 48:23.799
We need that computer.

48:29.840 --> 48:31.273
There's a phone
in the room.

48:31.560 --> 48:32.993
I can use it to
delete the files.

48:59.520 --> 49:01.272
Got the phone.
Where's that team?

49:01.440 --> 49:02.668
Five minutes out, sir.

49:02.840 --> 49:04.480
We're running out
of time. Get there.

49:48.200 --> 49:49.633
Listen to me, David.

49:49.840 --> 49:51.398
I've done something.

49:52.280 --> 49:53.474
Something...

49:55.400 --> 49:57.118
...that came at a cost.

49:58.080 --> 50:00.230
One day
you'll understand why.

50:01.960 --> 50:03.951
I gotta get back
to Washington.

50:05.400 --> 50:06.879
I love you, son.

50:59.160 --> 51:00.559
They're fighting, sir.

51:12.480 --> 51:13.629
One more firewall.

51:39.200 --> 51:40.838
Files deleted, sir.

51:43.240 --> 51:44.389
Call in.

52:20.360 --> 52:22.112
Bourne,
my name is Heather Lee.

52:22.840 --> 52:24.398
I'm not in charge here.

52:25.440 --> 52:27.715
I wasn't here when
you went missing.

52:28.640 --> 52:32.428
I can see you're going through
the old Treadstone files.

52:33.160 --> 52:34.718
Retracing your history.

52:36.240 --> 52:38.674
I know you're
looking for something.

52:39.360 --> 52:41.749
Let me help you find it.

52:47.680 --> 52:48.749
Give me that phone.

52:54.080 --> 52:55.308
Yes, sir.

52:57.880 --> 53:00.348
Jason, this is Robert Dewey.
Do you remember me?

53:01.840 --> 53:04.354
Jason, your dad
was a patriot.

53:04.440 --> 53:07.000
He could see the threats
that America was facing,

53:07.120 --> 53:10.430
and, like you, he chose
to serve his country

53:10.520 --> 53:13.034
out of a profound
sense of duty.

53:14.360 --> 53:16.874
He would not want to
see you harm the Agency.

53:17.040 --> 53:18.758
You have to stop this.

53:19.680 --> 53:21.511
And you have to
stop it now.

53:26.080 --> 53:27.080
Sir, our ETA is...

53:51.960 --> 53:53.552
He's on the move.
Be ready.

54:08.120 --> 54:09.235
Take point!

54:09.320 --> 54:10.355
On me!

54:10.440 --> 54:11.839
The elevator.

54:59.960 --> 55:01.871
We lost him, sir.

55:18.200 --> 55:20.760
Malcolm Smith, contract only,
based out of London.

55:20.840 --> 55:22.896
Ran all of Treadstone's
surveillance in the late '90s,

55:22.920 --> 55:23.989
when Bourne was recruited.

55:24.400 --> 55:25.549
Is he still active?

55:25.640 --> 55:27.000
He's private security now.

55:27.040 --> 55:28.056
Contact the Asset

55:28.080 --> 55:30.674
and tell him I want him on the
ground in London in six hours.

55:30.760 --> 55:32.512
I think that could be
a mistake, sir.

55:36.240 --> 55:37.514
A mistake? Why?

55:37.600 --> 55:40.876
There is an argument for catching
Bourne instead of killing him.

55:42.240 --> 55:43.912
All right, let's hear it.

55:44.040 --> 55:46.918
Bourne's been off
the grid for a long time.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.514
He's been hiding in the shadows,
he's seen things.

55:49.680 --> 55:51.955
He knows things
that could help us.

55:52.040 --> 55:54.998
Bringing him back in
is the smart move.

55:55.200 --> 55:56.633
And how are we
going to do that?

55:56.720 --> 55:58.392
Albert Hirsch wrote
a psych evaluation

55:58.480 --> 55:59.708
when Bourne
left the program.

55:59.880 --> 56:02.599
He concluded Bourne is
still a patriot at heart,

56:02.680 --> 56:03.874
and that leaving
the program

56:03.960 --> 56:06.076
could come back
to haunt him.

56:08.000 --> 56:09.592
And what are you
suggesting?

56:09.760 --> 56:12.035
I watched Bourne
with those files.

56:13.560 --> 56:15.232
Desperately
looking into his past.

56:15.400 --> 56:18.551
And I think he's
at a tipping point.

56:18.640 --> 56:21.279
If I could get
face-to-face with him,

56:21.360 --> 56:22.998
I think I can
bring him back in.

56:23.800 --> 56:24.869
One attempt.

56:24.960 --> 56:26.871
And if it fails,

56:27.480 --> 56:29.516
you do what you have to.

56:33.080 --> 56:35.753
Well, it makes sense to me.
What do you think, Bob?

56:37.920 --> 56:40.070
Let's give it a shot.

56:40.160 --> 56:41.160
All right, do it.

56:42.040 --> 56:44.600
Bring Bourne in,
or tie it off.

56:44.760 --> 56:45.795
But this ends now.

56:45.920 --> 56:47.035
Thank you, sir.

56:59.080 --> 57:00.115
Sir, I'm sorry...

57:00.240 --> 57:02.674
No, don't worry
about that.

57:03.680 --> 57:05.989
Better get some sleep, kid.

57:07.280 --> 57:10.033
You got a long 24 hours
ahead of you.

57:13.040 --> 57:14.189
Yes, sir.

57:28.480 --> 57:29.536
It's taking too long.

57:29.560 --> 57:31.480
It shouldn't still be buggy
this close to launch.

57:31.560 --> 57:32.616
Well, I don't think
it's buggy.

57:32.640 --> 57:33.959
I think we've
changed some things

57:34.040 --> 57:35.376
that's going to
change the parameters.

57:35.400 --> 57:36.674
We're going to
have to go and...

57:36.760 --> 57:38.136
Okay, well, we need
to change them back.

57:38.160 --> 57:39.456
Amanda, can we get
that note over to Kyle?

57:39.480 --> 57:40.549
Absolutely.

57:40.640 --> 57:42.278
Look,
I think you're right,

57:42.360 --> 57:44.828
I just don't think we want to...
I'm tired of waiting.

57:47.680 --> 57:48.999
Mr. Kalloor.

57:49.080 --> 57:50.195
What the hell is this?

57:50.320 --> 57:52.117
Mr. Kalloor,
my name is John Burroughs.

57:52.200 --> 57:53.872
I'm from
the Department of Justice.

57:53.960 --> 57:56.040
I'm hereby serving you with
the enclosed complaint...

57:56.080 --> 57:58.536
Really? We have to do this in public?
Issued by the US government

57:58.560 --> 57:59.834
against Deep Dream
Corporation

57:59.920 --> 58:01.638
for violation of
the Sherman Act.

58:01.720 --> 58:03.790
This complaint
requires you to preserve

58:03.880 --> 58:05.836
all personal and corporate
financial records

58:05.960 --> 58:09.236
pending antitrust motions to
be filed in federal court.

58:09.320 --> 58:10.514
Good day.

58:22.120 --> 58:23.189
This is Dewey.
Aaron,

58:24.120 --> 58:25.633
it's a message.

58:25.760 --> 58:27.616
And maybe we should
think about what we're doing

58:27.640 --> 58:28.755
before it gets any worse.

58:28.880 --> 58:32.156
So, you think if we give him
what he wants, it'll end there?

58:32.240 --> 58:35.152
You know, I'm just saying
that maybe we should listen.

58:36.480 --> 58:37.736
I want you to pull up
all the records

58:37.760 --> 58:39.637
of all the meetings
I've ever had with Dewey.

58:40.240 --> 58:43.516
All the records?
Even the off-the-books discussions?

58:44.560 --> 58:45.754
Especially those.

58:48.960 --> 58:52.111
We're going to Vegas.
I need an insurance policy.

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.160
Yeah.

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:15.639
Are you in London?

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:16.948
Yes.

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:19.757
Why are you sending her?

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.112
She serves a purpose.

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.394
I work alone.

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:25.913
Not this time.

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:28.751
Don't make this personal.

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:33.275
Bourne betrayed us.
It's always been personal.

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:35.470
You know who
you're dealing with.

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:38.190
You better make sure
you're ready.

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:48.560
Yeah.

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:51.319
There's something you
should know about Deep Dream.

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:53.118
But I need an assurance

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:55.912
that I have your support.

01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.310
You got it.
What do you have?

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.155
Kalloor

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:05.033
is planning
something for Vegas.

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:51.680
Yes?

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:53.193
This is Jason Bourne.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.274
I need to talk.

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:57.714
What about?

01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:59.472
I don't work for
the Agency anymore.

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:02.399
Paddington Plaza,
15 minutes.

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:32.955
Bourne just called Smith.

01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:35.233
They're meeting
at Paddington Plaza.

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.072
15 minutes.

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:38.752
We'll tail Smith
the whole way.

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:41.952
As soon as we get eyes on Bourne,
I'll approach him.

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:43.393
Whatever you do,
stay contained.

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:46.517
I don't want the Brits crawling
all over us, asking questions.

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:47.953
Understood.

01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:57.674
Tracking device.

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:00.472
You'll hold on the south
side of the bridge.

01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:03.518
I'll contact you
if I need you.

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.275
Sure.

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:07.560
You're the boss, right?

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:39.399
Subject is on the move.
Heading toward the canal.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.311
Alpha Team,
take a parallel track.

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:44.950
Bravo Team, follow
the subject from behind.

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:46.632
And keep your
eyes open for Bourne.

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:49.077
Bravo Team
tailing subject.

01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.035
Let's go.

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.917
In 200 meters,
make a right.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.319
Copy that.

01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:11.113
Comms check.
Second channel. Do you copy?

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:13.353
I have you.
Where are you now?

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:14.589
Heading towards Smith.

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:17.555
No sign of Bourne.

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:01.233
Subject has
turned east,

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:02.320
into an alley.

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:03.400
Alpha Team,

01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:05.920
that alley leads to a footbridge,
which will bring him to you.

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:07.360
Copy that.

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:21.313
Bravo Team is down.

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:22.600
Sending you
updated route now.

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:26.193
You copy that, Smith?

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:29.640
Yes.

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:50.912
Bravo Team, why aren't you moving?
What's going on?

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:54.439
Bravo Team,
do you copy?

01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:57.311
What's happening, Heather?
Where's Bravo?

01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:59.353
We're comms down on Bravo.

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:01.591
Alpha Team, do you have
eyes on the subject?

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:07.949
We have eyes on.

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:16.437
Alpha Team, sit-rep.

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:23.232
Alpha Team, report.

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:24.799
What's happening, Heather?

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:27.638
Alpha Team
isn't responding.

01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:29.312
Bravo?

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:30.594
Still nothing.

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:33.000
You lost both teams?
Get a grip on this operation, Heather.

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:34.040
That's Bourne.

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:35.913
Green-light the Asset.

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:38.233
Sir, I need more time.

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:39.514
We have no time.

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:42.031
Are you going to
give that order or not?

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:43.519
Sir, please.

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:45.511
You are too naive
to see the truth.

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:48.114
There's no
bringing in Bourne.

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.872
He has to be put down,

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:52.030
and you obviously cannot do
what has to be done.

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:54.356
I am taking
operational control.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:57.472
Asset, you have
a green light.

01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:00.473
Repeat, you have
a green light on Bourne.

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:01.595
Copy that.

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:03.119
I'm on my way.

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:13.111
Asset, are you
on the move?

01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:17.915
Asset, your tracking device
says you're stationary.

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:20.039
Are you moving?

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:22.958
Heather, stay off this channel.
Let him do his job.

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:27.640
Left here.

01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:30.474
- Get to Paddington Plaza, fast.
- Copy that.

01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:14.514
In position.

01:08:24.439 --> 01:08:25.634
Locked in.

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:45.760
What's going on?

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.069
What's that noise?

01:08:48.359 --> 01:08:50.112
Multiple fire alarms.

01:08:50.279 --> 01:08:51.712
That's Bourne.

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:56.828
What do I do?

01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:00.031
You stay there.
You do not move.

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:10.520
Leave the building
by the nearest available exit.

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:13.269
I can't stay here.

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:15.038
You can't protect me.

01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:16.917
I need you to stay
where you are, Smith.

01:09:17.439 --> 01:09:18.589
You still have
line of sight?

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:22.113
I'm on him.

01:09:22.279 --> 01:09:23.429
You're gonna shoot him

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.670
in a crowd when
he's right next to me?

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:27.399
Stay where you are,
Smith.

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:29.432
You know why he's here.

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:30.709
He wants answers.

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:32.029
You've lost this thing.

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:34.029
I gotta get out of here.

01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:42.839
Shit!

01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:53.233
What the hell
is going on?

01:09:53.399 --> 01:09:55.152
Bourne's got Smith.

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:16.348
Go after them. I'll come
around and cut them off.

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:23.576
Smith, we know
you're with Bourne.

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:25.640
You have to find a way to
let us know where you are.

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:30.512
Why are you
taking me in here?

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:32.119
They've got to be
near the Plaza.

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:39.199
Jesus, Bourne!

01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:40.320
God damn it!

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:44.397
What are you doing?
Take it easy.

01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:45.629
Richard Webb.

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:47.512
Station Chief, Beirut.

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:50.273
He was my father.
He started Treadstone.

01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:52.669
He hired you to put me
under surveillance. Why?

01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:54.512
Jesus!
Why did he hire you?

01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:55.993
Don't say anything, Smith.

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:57.679
No. No.

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:05.920
There's no
sign of them.

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:07.549
What do you want us to do?

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:09.318
Work your way
down the canal.

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:11.277
I'll circle around
and meet you there.

01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:17.790
You followed me
to Beirut.

01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:20.155
The last time
I saw my father!

01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:21.559
Why would he
have you follow me?

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:23.997
It doesn't make
any sense. Why?

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:26.270
Don't give him
a goddamn thing.

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:27.949
Why?

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:38.591
Jesus Christ, Bourne!
I'm falling!

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:40.518
Bourne, please!

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:42.431
I can hear them!

01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:43.589
Beirut.

01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:46.877
I went there to tell him that
Treadstone had approached me.

01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:48.309
But if it was
his program,

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.311
why didn't he
say anything to me?

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:52.879
I've done something.

01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:55.079
Something...

01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.159
...that came at a cost.

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:04.192
That was the day
he was killed.

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:06.917
They said he was
killed by terrorists.

01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:09.715
He wasn't killed
by terrorists, was he?

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:12.837
Think about your family's safety, Smith.
You keep your mouth shut.

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:15.312
The next bullet's
in your head!

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:17.599
Why was he killed?

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:19.520
Why?

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:22.911
He was killed
because of you.

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:29.153
Your father,
he wasn't in Operations.

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:31.800
He didn't know we'd chosen you.
When he found out, he...

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:34.750
He threatened
to expose the program.

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:37.434
He didn't want you
turned into a killer.

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:46.589
Who killed him?

01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:56.789
Who killed him?

01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:58.199
Don't do it.

01:12:58.880 --> 01:12:59.880
Where is he?

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.353
He's almost there.

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:09.670
We're gonna
stop this now.

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.473
No, please.

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:32.032
Somebody help!
Call an ambulance!

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:34.120
Someone help!

01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:37.071
He went off the roof.
Five floors.

01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:38.833
He recognized me.

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:41.310
I'm going to make
sure it's finished.

01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:48.478
Help's coming now.

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:49.754
No, don't get up, mate.

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:55.833
Step aside, please.
Step aside.

01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:57.800
Everybody step back.

01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:00.280
- Let us do our job.
- Please step back.

01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:03.040
Did anybody
see what happened?

01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:04.120
He's gone.

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:06.111
Oh, shit.
I'm going after him.

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:07.792
I'll work my way
down the canal.

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:11.836
No. You're done
in London.

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:13.353
What are you
talking about?

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:15.032
There's another
play to be made.

01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:18.188
Now that he knows what we did,
he'll come for both of us,

01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:21.113
and that could be the
opportunity for something else.

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:22.948
This isn't about revenge.

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:24.189
Yes, it is.

01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:27.035
And it won't be done
until one of us is dead.

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:29.836
Get to the airport.

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:32.070
We have a problem
with Iron Hand.

01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:35.234
Copy that.

01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:44.994
Give me a sit-rep.

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:46.593
We've got nothing.

01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:47.999
Keep looking.

01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:56.313
Drive.

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:03.056
It wasn't supposed
to go like this.

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:04.149
I wanted to talk.

01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:05.912
Where's Dewey going?

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:11.029
He's going to Vegas

01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:13.839
to speak with Aaron Kalloor
at a cyber convention.

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:16.673
The Agency recruits there
every year.

01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:18.079
What's Iron Hand?

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:22.034
Dewey's new
black-ops program.

01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:25.276
Full-spectrum surveillance.

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:27.954
Watching everyone
all the time.

01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:30.873
Dewey needs Kalloor's
cooperation to bring it online.

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:34.560
Let me out.

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:37.955
I can help you get there.

01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:43.629
Why would you do that?

01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:45.318
You and I have
different reasons,

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:47.356
but we both
want Dewey gone.

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:52.875
Here, take this.

01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:08.998
I'll see you in Vegas.

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:35.593
Sir.

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:38.993
We're pinning Kalloor's
hit on a fictional jihadi shooter.

01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:41.071
A 20-year-old
Iraqi national.

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:44.352
We created bank accounts,
travel documents, e-mails, phone records.

01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:46.509
He'll look like
a lone wolf.

01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:47.749
Any physical evidence?

01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:51.071
The Asset leaves the gun.
It'll have the Iraqi's prints on it.

01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:54.910
Russell doesn't need
to know about this.

01:16:57.520 --> 01:16:59.033
I understand, sir.

01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:01.712
Any news on Bourne?

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:03.075
Nothing.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.190
He was always
gonna come for me.

01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:11.911
Well, if it happens,
we'll deal with it.

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:50.360
What was the purpose
of your visit

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:51.719
to London, Mr. Michaels?

01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:54.359
Business.

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:20.874
Welcome home, sir.

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:23.440
Thank you.

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:40.672
Parking lot clear.
You're good to go.

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:47.120
Sir, we have a secure room for you,
right upstairs.

01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:49.519
Enjoy your stay.
Thank you.

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:52.473
Hi, welcome to the Aria.

01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:54.796
Heather Lee, checking in.
Okay.

01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:03.879
We have you in a lovely Sky Suite.
Number 2016.

01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:05.789
Enjoy your stay.

01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:06.880
Thank you.

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:16.472
Aaron!

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:20.468
All right, Aaron!

01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:21.709
Deep Dream!

01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:35.471
Find Lee.

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:37.795
Tell her I want to see her
before we go on stage.

01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:39.239
Yes, sir.

01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:41.675
I want agents posted backstage
as well as the auditorium.

01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:42.875
Yes, sir.

01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:54.671
Coming through,
make a hole.

01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:56.876
Make a hole, make a hole.

01:20:57.920 --> 01:20:59.320
Gonna make
a quick stop here.

01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:02.039
Hey, guys. Hi. How's it going?
Aaron.

01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:03.189
Good to meet you.

01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:04.869
Can I get one?

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:08.793
Thanks very much
for your hard work.

01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:13.109
Thank you.

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:14.480
You're doing a great job.

01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:47.480
Yeah.

01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:49.119
You all set?

01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:51.316
Checking
the departure route now.

01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:53.311
You won't have much time.

01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:56.991
They won't know where it came from.
I'll have enough time.

01:21:58.280 --> 01:21:59.599
After you take care
of Kalloor,

01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:01.136
I'll be standing,
left hand at my side.

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:02.195
You put a bullet in it.

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.356
It's better
if I'm a target, too.

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:06.714
Copy that.

01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:47.360
Lee.

01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:52.031
The Director wants a word
before you go on stage.

01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:54.834
Of course.

01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:18.560
ID?

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:20.160
Thanks.

01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:45.280
Ah.

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:46.520
Heather.

01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:50.399
My protegee.
Strongest supporter.

01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:52.712
You know, after what
happened in London,

01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:54.353
I did not know
what to do with you.

01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:56.829
I suppose we'll just, um,

01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:59.388
write it off
to your learning curve.

01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:01.519
I'd appreciate that.

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:05.633
At least you can now
see that you never had a chance.

01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:09.038
When Bourne turns up again,
I'll deal with him.

01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:10.712
Do you understand?

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:12.392
Of course.

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:14.072
I agree completely.

01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:18.518
When we get on stage,

01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:19.656
I'll handle all
the policy questions,

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:21.477
throw everything
technical to you.

01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:22.629
I'll be ready, sir.

01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:24.312
Okay, let's do this.

01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:36.148
Badges?

01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:54.389
Aaron.

01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:56.360
Robert.

01:24:58.160 --> 01:24:59.798
You know Heather Lee.

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:05.875
Yeah, we went
to Stanford together.

01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:09.154
Wow. How are you enjoying
life at the Agency?

01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:11.994
Challenging. But fulfilling.

01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:15.678
It's tough to stay true to
your principles over there?

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:18.475
My principles
are just fine, thanks.

01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:22.256
Gentlemen, we're ready for you.
Follow me, please.

01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:23.280
I'm going to enjoy this.

01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:26.153
So am I.

01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:41.233
Thank you, sir.

01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:04.152
Oh! Hi! How's everybody
doing tonight?

01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:07.199
Welcome.

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:11.079
Welcome.

01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:16.195
Welcome to tonight's
EXOCON Symposium.

01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:20.479
We are so lucky to have four
fantastic guests this evening.

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:23.878
The CIA Director,
Robert Dewey, is here.

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:30.195
And a dear friend of mine,
and an old friend of EXOCON,

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:34.990
the CEO of social-media giant Deep
Dream, Aaron Kalloor is here.

01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:11.989
Tonight,
"Policing a free Internet,

01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:15.792
"personal rights
versus public safety."

01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:18.594
This is the great
question of our time.

01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:21.513
And the choices we make about
this will determine our future.

01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:24.316
So let's just
dive right in, okay?

01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:28.033
Come on out here, guys.

01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:30.869
Sir, you've got
an incoming message.

01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:31.960
High priority.

01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:34.856
All right, guys,
I'm gonna have to take this.

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:36.996
I'll catch up
with you later.

01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:38.080
Go ahead.

01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:47.838
Thanks for having me. Hey.

01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:00.954
It appears Director
Dewey is held up momentarily,

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:04.510
and I am being told that it
shouldn't be too much longer.

01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:06.296
But we have a ton of stuff
to get into tonight,

01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:07.656
- so we can start anyway...
- Brad?

01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:09.318
Brad, could I
say a few words?

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:11.472
Excuse me?
Can I get the ball rolling?

01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:13.113
Oh, sure, man,
by all means.

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:15.316
Ladies and gentlemen,
Aaron Kalloor.

01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:27.915
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:31.549
Thanks a lot to Brad
and all the folks at EXOCON

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:33.232
for having us back,

01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:35.197
and to you guys
for turning out.

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:38.800
Before the Director
comes out to join us,

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:41.553
I just wanted to share
a few words with you guys.

01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:44.229
A long time ago,
I had this idea.

01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:47.234
Copy that. A beautiful idea,
to create a place, online...

01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:48.753
Facial recognition
got a hit.

01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:50.876
Bourne was on a BA flight
from Heathrow to Vegas.

01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:52.439
It landed two hours ago.

01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:55.630
How the hell did he get
through immigration?

01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:58.518
Someone issued him an Agency
security clearance on his passport.

01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:02.656
Well, it turned out
to be a pretty popular idea.

01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:03.920
Um...

01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:06.514
People from around the world
started using our service.

01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:19.800
Well, first off,

01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:22.953
this has all made me a lot more
rich than is probably healthy.

01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:27.119
When I come on stage, take
care of Kalloor and the girl.

01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:29.398
Copy.

01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:31.096
But, what I mean
to say is that, you know,

01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:33.111
all this success
has come at a cost.

01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:37.077
There is a cancer
at the heart of Deep Dream.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.275
A guilty secret, and, um...

01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:43.760
I have to share it
with all of you guys.

01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:45.256
Son of a bitch
is about to take us down.

01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:46.840
Take out Kalloor
and the girl right now.

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:52.720
Whoa, whoa...

01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:54.472
Stay there.
Okay.

01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:57.950
When I was
starting out, I, uh...

01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:01.315
I took money
to start my company.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.911
Made a bargain with a
guy in a dark suit...

01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:11.395
...and now he's come
back to take my soul.

01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:21.496
I see the shooter!

01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:22.720
We've got eyes
on Jason Bourne.

01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:25.296
He's still breathing.
Call an ambulance!

01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:26.320
Go, go!

01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:29.517
Let's go!
Sir, we gotta go.

01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:43.793
Head for the exit!

01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:48.678
This is Vasquez.
We're on Bourne.

01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:50.029
Get the cars ready!

01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:52.316
Get the cars ready
right now!

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:53.799
No, take me
to the suite.

01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:56.176
Sir, we've got to get you out of here.
Bourne is on the loose.

01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:59.397
You heard me.
Take me to the suite.

01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:00.515
Yes, sir.

01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:02.631
Take him to the suite.
Take him upstairs.

01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:03.755
Get him upstairs.

01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:04.880
Right now. Right now.

01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:06.200
Up to the suite.

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:08.520
Let's go, right now.
Go, go, go! Yes, sir.

01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:12.070
Come this way. This way.
Don't worry. Come on.

01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:18.557
Out of the way!
Federal agent!

01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:28.517
Vasquez, sit-rep.

01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:30.279
Vasquez, come in!

01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:34.080
Hey!

01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:53.816
Okay, we've got him.

01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:54.840
Sir, this is Collier.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.991
We've ID'd the sniper.
Shit.

01:31:57.080 --> 01:31:58.672
We're circulating
his photo now.

01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:00.159
What about Bourne?

01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:02.196
Hang on.

01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:04.416
Okay, Bourne is just leaving
the west service corridor,

01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:05.759
heading for the lobby.

01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:07.598
Copy that. Stay on Bourne.

01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:11.349
What?

01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:12.856
We're still
looking for Bourne.

01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:14.677
And they've ID'd the Asset.

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:34.096
Go back to the first floor and
wait for further instructions.

01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:35.712
Yes, sir. Copy that.
Copy that.

01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:55.035
Everybody down! Right now!

01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:56.593
Down, move, move, move!

01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:00.151
Out of the way!
Federal agents! Move!

01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:25.998
Take a team to the northeast elevators.
I'll meet you up there.

01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:35.677
Bourne's on his way
up to you.

01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:28.199
You took a long time
to get here, Jason.

01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:30.912
I know about Beirut.

01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:33.239
I know what you did.

01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:36.438
It all ends tonight.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.434
Be a lot easier
to do it right away.

01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:48.512
You didn't
come here for revenge.

01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:51.717
You came here because you
know it's time to come in.

01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:01.276
Your father
created the program.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.673
Didn't have what
it takes to make it work.

01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:06.028
And you did.

01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:08.433
You always did.

01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:12.438
That's why you volunteered.

01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:15.552
I volunteered because I thought
our enemies killed him.

01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:18.632
I volunteered
because of a lie.

01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:21.553
No, you volunteered
because of who you are.

01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:23.870
You volunteered because
you are Jason Bourne,

01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:26.520
and not David Webb.

01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:38.072
Thirty-two kills, Jason.

01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:40.232
Every one of them
made a difference.

01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:44.598
People all across this country are
safer because of what you did.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.831
I'm trying
to find another way.

01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:04.310
And how's that
working out for you?

01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:13.997
You're never
going to find any peace.

01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:18.951
Not until you admit to
yourself who you really are.

01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:23.031
It's time
to come in, Jason.

01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:26.359
It's time to come in.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.194
I can't.

01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:40.560
Not for you.

01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:17.833
You were never here.

01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:26.920
You don't have to
go after him.

01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:31.873
This can stop now.

01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:34.798
You have a choice.

01:37:57.520 --> 01:37:59.376
- Let's go!
- Have your IDs ready.

01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:02.039
Have your IDs ready,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:05.873
Have your IDs ready!
Come on, guys, let's go, let's go!

01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:15.951
Stand in a line. Las Vegas Police,
ladies and gentlemen!

01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:01.113
BearCat SWAT truck
and unmarked black Dodge Charger

01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:02.520
stolen from
the front of the Aria.

01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:11.910
Pursuit in progress.
Air support requested.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.115
What was that ID?

01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:26.752
Stop him!
Block that road!

01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:31.080
Oh, my God!

01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:34.280
Fire!

01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:38.720
Move out!

01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:24.840
Move!

01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:30.336
Next two units involved, identify.

01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:32.936
This is Air 1. Be advised, suspect vehicles

01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:35.160
have crashed into the southeast
entrance of the Riviera.

01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:47.896
We have an armed
suspect heading into

01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:49.911
the storm drain
south of the Riviera.

01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:45.800
Aah!

01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:42.433
You're a traitor.
You've always been a traitor.

01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:44.799
It's in your blood.

01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:10.393
Mr. Kalloor!

01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:14.536
Aaron! What were you going
to tell everyone at the convention?

01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:16.152
What are
you hiding, Aaron?

01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:17.240
Easy.

01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:18.360
Get back.

01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:20.016
Why did somebody
try to assassinate you?

01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:22.280
What's the cancer
at the heart of Deep Dream?

01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:23.640
I think it would
be inappropriate

01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:24.936
to pass any
comment at this stage,

01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:26.920
but I look forward to
working with the authorities

01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:28.552
to find out who
was responsible.

01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:29.896
And to getting
back to Deep Dream,

01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:32.229
where we can continue our important work.
Thank you.

01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:34.920
Have you been
lying to your users?

01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:07.720
Sir.

01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:19.478
I wanted to say
I'm sorry, sir.

01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:21.952
About Vegas.

01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:25.909
Director Dewey's
tactics were unwise.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:27.433
Unwise?

01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:29.600
We're still
trying to come up with

01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:31.120
a narrative to
explain what happened.

01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:35.513
That son of a bitch put
a spotlight on Iron Hand.

01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:37.838
On all of us.

01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:39.956
Kalloor hasn't
gone public yet.

01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:42.954
I know Aaron.

01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:46.150
There are still moves
we can make with him.

01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:50.508
Tell me.

01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:53.998
Dewey's problem was
that he belonged in the past.

01:49:55.680 --> 01:49:57.671
People like Kalloor
are shaping the future.

01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:00.039
These are my people.

01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:03.590
I know how to deal with him.

01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:08.431
And what do you want?

01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:11.271
When you appoint
a new Agency Director,

01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:13.560
you're going to need someone
working for your interests.

01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:16.629
Someone

01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:20.070
empowered by you.

01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:24.709
What about Bourne?

01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:28.470
You still think
you can bring him in?

01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:32.759
I have his trust.

01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:34.869
After what we went through.

01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:38.393
I'll bring him in.

01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:40.198
I'm certain of it.

01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:44.437
And if you can't?

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:49.629
Then he'll have
to be put down.

01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:55.550
It's an interesting proposal.

01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:01.999
You can pull over here.

01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:10.190
Of course, if you decide
that you don't need me,

01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:11.349
then that's not a problem.

01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:15.157
There are many other agencies
who would want what I know.

01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:46.439
I brought you something.

01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:54.071
It's a cast from
your father's star,

01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:56.151
on the Memorial
Wall at Langley.

01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:08.277
I'm sorry for
what happened to you.

01:52:11.160 --> 01:52:12.559
How you were treated.

01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:15.279
But the people that
did that are gone,

01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:18.875
and things are
changing at the Agency.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.558
What is it you want?

01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:25.717
I know you've
always been a patriot.

01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:30.318
That what happens to this
country matters to you.

01:52:31.880 --> 01:52:33.791
We need you to
help protect us.

01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:36.759
Come back in.

01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:40.717
And we'll work together.

01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:50.119
Let me think about it.

01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:52.799
How will I find you?

01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:41.436
You still think
you can bring him in?

01:53:41.560 --> 01:53:43.232
I have his trust.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:45.638
After what we went through.

01:53:46.680 --> 01:53:47.874
I'll bring him in.

01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:50.033
I'm certain of it.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:52.353
And if you can't?

01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:57.716
Then he'll have
to be put down.
