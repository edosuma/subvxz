00:03.640 --> 00:07.633
So late. Playing around like this in the
morning. You can't afford to do this, Josh.

00:09.000 --> 00:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:18.520 --> 00:20.476
Come on, Josh.

00:44.320 --> 00:45.833
Kind regards...

01:01.400 --> 01:05.108
I'm not doing you a favour.
I don't do favours unless it's for me.

01:05.200 --> 01:07.111
In which case it isn't a favour.

01:07.200 --> 01:08.997
Precisely. You know advertising.

01:09.080 --> 01:12.311
Faster turnover than football management.
I've lost five staff.

01:12.400 --> 01:14.709
Three to competitors, one's pregnant,

01:14.800 --> 01:17.519
one's had a breakdown
and one's ''finding himself''.

01:17.600 --> 01:19.238
That's six.
- What?

01:19.320 --> 01:23.916
You said you'd lost five. - Oh, no.
The pregnant one went to a competitor.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.911
They don't know yet.

01:26.520 --> 01:30.035
You're not planning anything
like that, are you? - Er, no.

01:30.120 --> 01:33.954
Good. Right, well, cut the crap.
Re-start at your old level, same salary. OK?

01:34.040 --> 01:36.759
Brilliant. Yeah. Thanks.
- OK. Danny!

01:36.840 --> 01:39.513
Are you doing anything
for the rest of the day? - No.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.512
You are now. Danny Burke, Rachel BradIey.

01:42.600 --> 01:46.309
Rachel'll be joining your team as of now.
- Great. I could use the help.

01:46.400 --> 01:48.755
Actually, this schedule needs typing up.

01:48.840 --> 01:50.592
Rachel's the new account manager.

01:52.040 --> 01:53.314
Right.

01:54.600 --> 01:56.716
Can I get you some coffee?
- Tea, please.

01:56.800 --> 01:58.756
Coffee for me.

02:04.920 --> 02:06.876
Hi, Amy.

02:14.040 --> 02:17.077
Amy, are you all right?
- Shouldn't I be?

02:19.120 --> 02:21.680
Isn't that the document
you were supposed to shred?

02:21.760 --> 02:23.557
Yeah.

02:23.640 --> 02:26.393
Well, you're actually feeding it
into the photocopier.

02:30.720 --> 02:32.676
Oh, shit!

02:36.840 --> 02:38.751
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

02:38.840 --> 02:40.796
Are you OK?
- No.

02:43.160 --> 02:44.718
Come in here.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.396
Go on. Go on. Take your time.

03:00.480 --> 03:03.870
Although I've got a meeting at 11 o'clock.

03:03.960 --> 03:06.235
It's... It's Adam. He...

03:07.120 --> 03:09.076
He dumped me.

03:09.480 --> 03:11.471
That was two weeks ago, love.

03:11.560 --> 03:14.757
But...I haven't cried...yet.

03:17.040 --> 03:20.191
Well, you're certainly making up for it now.

03:22.520 --> 03:25.193
It'll be all round the office by now.

03:25.280 --> 03:30.229
Pete and Amy.
In the stationery cupboard in a clinch.

03:30.320 --> 03:32.231
It's all your fault.
- Don't blame me.

03:32.320 --> 03:34.231
You dumped her.

03:34.320 --> 03:36.231
Yeah... After two weeks.

03:36.320 --> 03:39.676
Yeah, I suppose most women
would be over you within minutes.

03:41.400 --> 03:43.914
How's Jen?
- Oh, nice segue.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.911
Oh, I didn't mean...

03:46.000 --> 03:47.956
You know, I wasn't...

03:49.520 --> 03:52.114
I'm not sure it's a good idea,
me coming tonight.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.918
I am.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.195
Me and Jenny, we're just
not talking any more.

04:08.120 --> 04:10.156
Actually, maybe I'll have some salt.

04:17.760 --> 04:19.637
You want me to make conversation?

04:19.720 --> 04:22.359
You're the demon we have to exorcise.

04:23.360 --> 04:26.158
What?
- Me and Jenny.

04:26.240 --> 04:28.674
We can't move on till we've
laid you to rest.

04:28.760 --> 04:32.753
Er, no. Look. Erm...I'm sure it's not a good
idea, me coming round to your place.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.512
We've already talked about it.

04:34.600 --> 04:37.433
I thought you had nothing to say.
- And she agrees.

04:37.520 --> 04:41.354
This is the only way the three of us
can get back to normal.

04:41.440 --> 04:44.034
You think that's possible?
- I don't see why not.

04:44.120 --> 04:45.997
Come on. It'll be all right.

04:46.080 --> 04:47.991
Oh, God, there she is.

04:48.080 --> 04:51.038
Ah, here they are... Hello!

04:51.120 --> 04:54.954
Look at that. Bang on time... Good lads.
Come here. Hello.

04:57.440 --> 04:59.158
Hey. Hi!

04:59.240 --> 05:01.549
Adam? Old mate. Hello. All right?

05:01.640 --> 05:03.392
Our friend, really. Yeah?

05:04.200 --> 05:06.236
You're looking good. Not that good, mind.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.151
Right. OK. Get in there!

05:09.240 --> 05:13.074
Come on, form an orderly queue!
Come on... Hey!

05:14.720 --> 05:16.676
It's going very well.

05:22.560 --> 05:23.788
Hello?

05:23.880 --> 05:24.869
Hi, David.

05:24.960 --> 05:27.474
Rachel. Is Karen not around?

05:27.560 --> 05:30.916
No. She's just popped out to the shops.
She'll be back in a minute.

05:32.680 --> 05:33.999
Make it snappy.

05:35.440 --> 05:38.557
Now, you know it's
our wedding anniversary next week?

05:38.640 --> 05:40.471
I did. I'm surprised you do.

05:40.560 --> 05:44.838
Karen usually plans a surprise, which is
her way of punishing me for forgetting.

05:44.920 --> 05:47.580
But this year, I thought
I'd beat her at her own game

05:47.955 --> 05:49.550
and find something to surprise her with.

05:49.640 --> 05:52.552
Remembering your anniversary should do that.

05:52.640 --> 05:55.598
What I thought I'd do is leave
Josh with Ramona

05:55.680 --> 05:58.194
and go away for a long weekend somewhere.

05:59.040 --> 06:00.029
New York?

06:00.120 --> 06:01.189
Or... London.

06:01.280 --> 06:03.714
London?
- Yeah. I don't know...

06:03.800 --> 06:07.236
Suite at The Dorchester.
Dinner at The Gavroche. Tickets to a show.

06:07.320 --> 06:09.276
She'll love it.

06:10.440 --> 06:13.796
Then I've got to think of
which show to go and see.

06:13.880 --> 06:16.075
I wondered about Cats.

06:16.160 --> 06:17.957
So do most people who've seen it.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.195
Or... The Phantom Of The Opera?

06:22.080 --> 06:23.877
Starlight Express?
- David...

06:23.960 --> 06:26.190
How many Lloyd Webber musicals
has she seen?

06:26.280 --> 06:28.111
None, I think.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.310
So not Andrew Lloyd Webber?
- Now you're talking.

06:34.600 --> 06:37.034
There's me in bed with Rachel.
- Rachel Two.

06:37.120 --> 06:38.758
When there's a knock at the door.

06:38.840 --> 06:42.753
I run down, stark bollock naked,
except for this hand towel. It's Rachel.

06:42.840 --> 06:43.716
Rachel One.

06:43.800 --> 06:46.075
What did she want?
- I never got to found out.

06:46.160 --> 06:49.869
There's a scream from upstairs and
there on the landing is the other Rachel.

06:49.960 --> 06:52.428
Rachel Two.
- Naked... And Amy.

06:52.520 --> 06:54.875
Amy?
- Yeah. In sexy lingerie.

06:54.960 --> 06:57.110
Mad cow had copied my keys
and let herself in.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.998
Thought she could seduce me
into us getting back together.

07:00.080 --> 07:02.275
What must Rachel have thought?
- Which one?

07:02.360 --> 07:06.353
That we were having an orgy. She turned
and fled. Haven't heard from her since.

07:06.440 --> 07:09.034
He can't move for women
throwing themselves at him!

07:19.720 --> 07:23.315
So what about you and the other slag,
er...Rachel?

07:23.400 --> 07:26.073
Rachel Two.
- Nothing happened that night, of course.

07:26.160 --> 07:28.075
Not once I'd escorted
Amy off the premises.

07:28.776 --> 07:30.517
But the next night I
reckoned we'd be back on.

07:32.040 --> 07:35.396
Adam, I really like you.
But I've been thinking.

07:35.480 --> 07:37.391
I mean...

07:37.480 --> 07:41.473
You are my landlord,
and Amy is my friend, and...

07:42.440 --> 07:45.159
I'm just not sure it's such a good idea.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.550
She's playing hard to get.

07:48.640 --> 07:51.359
The thought I consoled myself with.
Till the next night.

07:55.760 --> 07:57.716
Oh...God!

07:59.400 --> 08:01.072
Maybe she was on her own.

08:01.160 --> 08:03.594
Again, the thought I consoled myself with.

08:03.680 --> 08:05.591
Rachel?

08:05.680 --> 08:07.557
Yeah?

08:10.000 --> 08:11.956
Sorry, mate. All yours.

08:15.440 --> 08:18.352
They've been at it every night since.
Only one thing for it.

08:18.440 --> 08:20.908
Ask her to move out.
- Find a new girlfriend.

08:23.800 --> 08:26.145
Pudding? - Smashing idea.
- Magic!

08:51.080 --> 08:54.675
Are you going for a drink?
- Yeah, I reckon... But not with you.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.310
You're joking.
- Why not? She's gorgeous.

08:58.400 --> 08:59.355
Precisely.

09:03.520 --> 09:05.556
Tenner says I can.
- Pull?

09:05.640 --> 09:07.710
No, score.
- Make it 20.

09:12.680 --> 09:16.878
Adam? Were you serious
about wanting a girlfriend? Cos...

09:18.640 --> 09:22.679
I tell you what, I've been thinking
about that. - Oh, yeah?

09:25.640 --> 09:27.551
Oh, no. No, Jen... No, I'm...

09:27.640 --> 09:29.756
Not me! Oh, God.

09:29.840 --> 09:32.149
I think it's a good idea.

09:32.240 --> 09:34.754
I knew that... I knew that.

09:34.840 --> 09:39.277
We can go out together.
Me and Pete. And...you and whoever.

09:39.360 --> 09:41.510
Yeah... Yeah.

09:45.680 --> 09:48.114
So I'm just about done for tonight.

09:48.200 --> 09:51.237
Me, too.
- Yeah. Do you want to go for a drink?

09:51.320 --> 09:53.276
I don't think so, Danny.

09:54.640 --> 09:56.551
Oh... Right. Right.

09:56.640 --> 09:58.596
Just asking.

10:01.080 --> 10:03.310
The sad truth is that,
when you're in your 30s,

10:03.400 --> 10:07.837
it's nigh on impossible to meet someone
who's both attractive and on their own.

10:08.720 --> 10:11.075
She's attractive and on her own.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.070
She's standing at a tram stop.

10:14.160 --> 10:15.991
Probably on her way home to her husband.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.036
Uh-uh. No wedding ring.

10:18.120 --> 10:20.236
How do you suggest I found out?

10:26.960 --> 10:31.351
Excuse me. I couldn't help but notice
that we're travelling in the same direction.

10:31.440 --> 10:33.715
And, well, if you're wanting some company,

10:33.800 --> 10:37.713
I thought maybe we could travel together.

10:46.400 --> 10:47.594
Just a thought.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.318
Brilliant.

10:50.280 --> 10:52.032
Now...

10:52.120 --> 10:56.557
Just suppose you knew in advance,
right, that she'd be up for it.

10:56.640 --> 10:58.551
Would you ask her then?

10:58.640 --> 11:00.995
Hmm... Yeah.

11:01.480 --> 11:03.436
Ta-da! There you go.

11:03.560 --> 11:04.470
Meeting Place.

11:04.560 --> 11:07.074
Lonely Hearts?
- They don't call it that.

11:07.160 --> 11:08.878
Nor Sad Twats' Corner.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.633
I'm sorry, Jen.
But I'm not that desperate yet.

11:11.720 --> 11:13.676
Yeah, you are.

11:18.280 --> 11:20.475
Easiest 20 quid I've ever made.

11:22.040 --> 11:23.996
Just a drink, right?

11:25.080 --> 11:26.115
Absolutely, yeah.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.156
OK. Quite fancy a quick one.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.356
This one looks promising.

11:42.680 --> 11:44.875
''Slim, attractive virgin.'' Love it.

11:44.960 --> 11:46.951
''Virgoan.''

11:47.040 --> 11:48.996
''Virgoan.'' Oh, er...

11:49.080 --> 11:51.753
''26.'' Nice age.
- It was, yeah.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.751
''Seeks Taurean with GSOH.''

11:53.840 --> 11:55.831
GSOH. What's that? Like GCSE?

11:55.920 --> 11:57.911
Good Sense Of Humour.
- Oh, right.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.790
''You make me laugh, I'll make you supper.
Apply box R23N.''

12:07.920 --> 12:09.831
I don't know, really.

12:09.920 --> 12:12.514
''Dear slim, attractive Virgoan...''

12:12.600 --> 12:15.433
Hey, er...Jenny. What are you doing?

12:15.520 --> 12:17.033
Writing your reply.

12:17.120 --> 12:21.591
I don't think so. I can...maybe compose
something here myself, thanks.

12:21.680 --> 12:22.999
Well, go on, then.

12:23.080 --> 12:25.036
OK. Er...

12:28.040 --> 12:31.077
''Dear slim, attractive Virgoan...''

12:34.080 --> 12:36.036
- ''My...''
- Wait!

12:40.600 --> 12:42.556
''My...name is...''

12:42.800 --> 12:44.392
Is Adam! Yeah.

12:44.480 --> 12:46.391
Good lad.

12:46.480 --> 12:48.391
Right. ''I am...

12:48.480 --> 12:50.550
33 years old...''
- 30!

12:51.440 --> 12:54.352
You're 33.
- Today, I'm 30.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.637
''30 years old, a Taurean,
with a good sense of humour.''

12:57.720 --> 12:59.358
''A great sense of humour.''

12:59.440 --> 13:02.034
Yep.
- Right.

13:02.120 --> 13:04.076
What's next?

13:12.560 --> 13:14.278
Fancy a shag?

13:18.240 --> 13:20.708
I'll need to do a wee bit of work on this.

13:25.520 --> 13:29.798
Amy. Have you been asked on
this Outward Bound bollocks thing as well?

13:29.880 --> 13:32.314
Yeah. Everyone at our level.
- What's the point?

13:32.400 --> 13:35.278
''To identify and encourage
management potential.''

13:35.360 --> 13:37.749
I don't want to be a manager
so why do I have to go?

13:37.840 --> 13:40.274
Ah, it's only a weekend.
- Yeah. Unpaid.

13:44.760 --> 13:46.398
Is that it? What you came for?

13:46.480 --> 13:49.119
No, I came to check you were all right,
you know.

13:49.280 --> 13:51.032
After the other day.

13:52.720 --> 13:55.314
You are sweet.
- You're not still hung up over Adam?

13:55.400 --> 13:57.550
Ugh. I don't give him a second thought.

13:57.640 --> 13:59.232
It's like he never existed.

13:59.320 --> 14:01.276
Good.

14:07.800 --> 14:10.439
Let's go for a drink at lunch time, eh?

14:20.280 --> 14:23.556
God, I hate being late.
Can you go any faster?

14:23.640 --> 14:27.633
New York cabbies don't speak English
but they get you there on time.

14:33.200 --> 14:36.670
Natalie, it's Karen. Is David there?
- Yeah, he's here. You want a word?

14:36.760 --> 14:39.558
No, no. I don't want him
to know I'm speaking to you.

14:39.640 --> 14:41.471
Oh, OK. No problem.

14:41.560 --> 14:43.471
Um. Go left here. Left!

14:43.560 --> 14:44.879
Yeah.

14:44.960 --> 14:47.394
I'm phonlng up to ask you a favour.

14:47.480 --> 14:49.710
It's our wedding anniversary on Friday.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.392
Right.

14:52.560 --> 14:54.312
Not you! Straight on.

14:54.400 --> 14:57.631
Jeez Louise. What's the matter?
Don't you know this town?

14:57.960 --> 14:59.871
Sorry about that. Go on.

14:59.960 --> 15:03.873
''I want to take David to Paris
at the weekend as a surprise.

15:03.960 --> 15:06.952
Could you tell him
he's got to go on a business trip?

15:07.040 --> 15:11.556
I'll get the tickets and everything, and
I'll be waiting on the plane with champagne.

15:11.640 --> 15:13.551
Oh, it sounds wonderful.

15:13.640 --> 15:15.949
I'm sure he'll love it.
Wish I could go myself.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.314
Thanks, Natalie.

15:17.400 --> 15:19.391
OK. Call me again when it's sorted out.

15:19.480 --> 15:21.436
Talk soon... Bye-bye.

15:23.280 --> 15:24.838
That was about me?

15:24.920 --> 15:26.831
What?

15:26.920 --> 15:28.831
Oh, yeah. Um...

15:28.920 --> 15:31.480
Personnel. A fire training course.

15:32.560 --> 15:34.312
I'll love it?

15:35.240 --> 15:37.071
You wish you could go yourself?

15:37.160 --> 15:41.073
Mm... They let you set off
a fire extinguisher. Foam...

15:41.160 --> 15:43.071
It's terrific.

15:43.160 --> 15:46.311
Hey! Who told you
to stop at zebra crossings?

15:48.680 --> 15:50.591
The thing is, love's about power.

15:50.680 --> 15:54.195
When you love someone,
they have the power to hurt you. So they do.

15:54.280 --> 15:56.191
Jen never meant to hurt me.

15:56.280 --> 16:00.512
No, no. But that was the result
of her infatuation with Adam.

16:00.600 --> 16:04.354
Oh, Pete. I had no idea.
- I didn't want to broadcast it, did I?

16:04.440 --> 16:07.557
Oh... I'm really touched you confided in me.

16:07.640 --> 16:11.076
Makes me feel like crying, actually.
- No. Please don't. Stop.

16:11.160 --> 16:14.232
The reason I told you
was because other people were looking.

16:14.320 --> 16:18.677
I thought if you were the one with problems.
- Can you re-build your marriage?

16:18.760 --> 16:20.716
Oh, yeah!

16:22.880 --> 16:24.836
Maybe.

16:25.640 --> 16:27.551
I don't know.

16:27.640 --> 16:32.395
I thought if the three of us could
get back together, the way we were,

16:32.480 --> 16:34.914
we could forget any of this had happened.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.479
Now we have...

16:37.520 --> 16:41.433
..things still aren't right with Jen.
I think our problems run a lot deeper.

16:43.840 --> 16:48.391
Basically, she doesn't love me any more.
And I don't know what to do.

16:49.480 --> 16:50.708
Poor Pete.

16:57.680 --> 16:59.591
Do I owe you 20 quid?

16:59.680 --> 17:00.715
What?

17:00.800 --> 17:02.711
Our bet. Your boss.

17:02.800 --> 17:04.711
Oh, right. Rachel.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.869
You know, she's really great.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.871
I've always had a thing for older women.

17:08.960 --> 17:11.394
Yeah. Does she have a thing for you?

17:11.480 --> 17:13.391
Well, I'm working on that.

17:13.480 --> 17:15.277
I'll give you a week.

17:15.359 --> 17:19.114
You what? She's not like your Sue.
Might take me a bit longer than that.

17:19.200 --> 17:22.636
Yeah. Like forever and a day.
You've got seven days and counting.

17:31.560 --> 17:33.516
It's an outrage. A scandal.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.477
Maybe she hasn't got it yet.

17:35.560 --> 17:38.950
Of course she has. I sent it days ago.
I didn't use carrier pigeon.

17:39.040 --> 17:43.192
Maybe she's tried ringing
and then she didn't want to leave a message.

17:43.280 --> 17:45.157
I've been staying in.

17:46.240 --> 17:49.710
She's had loads of replies.
She's still sifting through 'em?

17:49.800 --> 17:52.155
So I'm like the other sad bastards?

17:52.240 --> 17:54.151
At least you're not in the reject pile.

17:54.240 --> 17:57.277
How do we know that?
- I don't know.

17:57.360 --> 17:59.954
What did you put in the letter, anyway?
- Ah.

18:00.040 --> 18:02.918
Ah. You've got a copy. Of course you have.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.797
Cos you're sad.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.791
In case we want to show it to our kids.

18:06.880 --> 18:10.589
Right... ''Dear Box R238.

18:10.680 --> 18:12.955
That was my mother's name.''
You wrote that?

18:13.040 --> 18:14.951
I was demonstrating my GSOH.

18:15.040 --> 18:16.951
And you are a very funny man.

18:17.040 --> 18:19.998
There you go.
She'll think you're Norman Bates.

18:20.080 --> 18:21.991
What about the rest of it? It's good.

18:22.080 --> 18:25.311
She won't have finished it.
We'll have to start again.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.311
Oh, no, no, no.

18:27.400 --> 18:30.870
Being completely humiliated once
is more than enough, thank you.

18:30.960 --> 18:32.951
We should put an ad in for you.

18:33.040 --> 18:35.634
It's much better. Then we can choose.

18:35.720 --> 18:37.676
We can choose?

18:40.400 --> 18:43.358
That was really good. I enjoyed that.
- Good?

18:43.440 --> 18:44.156
Great?

18:44.240 --> 18:47.949
It's a masterpiece!
It's Kurosawa's greatest film.

18:48.040 --> 18:52.079
But it's a bit derivative, though.
It's basically just The Magnificent Seven.

18:52.160 --> 18:54.833
The Magnificent Seven
was made six years later.

18:55.520 --> 18:57.476
Really?
- Mm.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.991
Have you ever seen
a Japanese film before?

19:01.080 --> 19:02.832
Yeah... Er...

19:02.920 --> 19:04.512
Bridge On The River Kwai.

19:06.920 --> 19:10.310
No, no. I'm pulling your leg.
Actually, I haven't seen that.

19:12.280 --> 19:14.919
So, what was the first film you ever saw?
Star Wars?

19:15.000 --> 19:16.911
Christ, no.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.672
I wasn't born when that came out.

19:20.280 --> 19:22.236
It's been really lovely.

19:22.920 --> 19:24.512
Don't you want to go for a drink?

19:24.600 --> 19:27.751
Well, I'm sure your mother
will be expecting you in.

19:30.360 --> 19:32.157
Rachel, do you think I'm too young?

19:32.240 --> 19:34.196
Yeah, I do, Danny. Yeah.

19:38.160 --> 19:41.550
But it'd be different
if I'd heard of Kurosawa, right?

19:48.840 --> 19:52.958
The Seven Samurai - or, to give
its correct title, Schichi-nin No Samurai -

19:53.040 --> 19:56.396
was inspired by the Westerns of John Ford.

19:56.480 --> 19:59.395
Toshiro Mifune, who plays
the role of Kikuchiyo,

20:00.169 --> 20:01.679
was one of Kurosawa's favourite actors.

20:01.760 --> 20:03.671
He'd already starred in Rashomon,

20:03.760 --> 20:07.309
and would again play a rootless samurai
in Yojimbo and Sanjuro,

20:07.400 --> 20:11.313
which would themselves inspire
Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Western trio,

20:11.400 --> 20:15.359
starring Clint Eastwood
as The Man With No Name.

20:18.080 --> 20:19.991
So, er...

20:20.080 --> 20:22.036
can we go for that drink?

20:24.520 --> 20:26.476
Yeah.

20:26.560 --> 20:27.913
OK.

20:31.240 --> 20:34.198
<i>It's the future of capitalism
that goes back...</i>

20:34.280 --> 20:36.236
Hiya.

20:38.040 --> 20:39.951
Hello.

20:40.040 --> 20:42.270
Good evening?
- Yeah.

20:43.320 --> 20:44.594
I went to the cinema.

20:44.680 --> 20:45.954
What did you see?

20:46.040 --> 20:48.600
Er, The Seven Samurai... Kurosawa?

20:50.720 --> 20:52.676
That's a bit old, isn't it?

20:52.760 --> 20:54.193
Does age matter?

20:55.960 --> 20:57.916
Does when it comes to whisky.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.399
Lovely.

21:02.280 --> 21:04.111
Seriously, David...

21:04.200 --> 21:07.237
You're what?
Seven years older than Karen.

21:07.320 --> 21:09.231
It's never been an issue, has it?

21:09.320 --> 21:11.231
No.

21:11.320 --> 21:13.231
Thanks.

21:13.320 --> 21:17.154
It's just that I've met this bloke
and that's the difference in our ages.

21:17.240 --> 21:19.151
Right. He's 35?

21:19.240 --> 21:20.275
21.

21:20.360 --> 21:22.271
You cradle snatcher.

21:23.160 --> 21:25.116
I'm also his boss.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.839
Yeah. Bad idea?

21:30.120 --> 21:32.076
I thought so.

21:32.320 --> 21:34.788
Oh, well. Night, David.
- Night.

21:35.880 --> 21:39.270
Oh, Rachel.
I've got Karen's ticket for London.

21:40.760 --> 21:42.671
Ooh. First class.

21:42.760 --> 21:45.354
Are you sure you can get her to go?
- Yeah, no problem.

21:45.440 --> 21:49.831
And she mustn't have any idea what
it's about. - David, trust me. Night-night.

21:50.840 --> 21:52.796
Sleep well.

21:53.800 --> 21:56.837
<i>One day America, the next day Asia.</i>

21:56.920 --> 22:00.196
The focus group results were good.
- I'm showing the client tomorrow.

22:00.280 --> 22:01.554
You've got an e-mail.

22:03.480 --> 22:05.198
Oh, yeah.

22:15.800 --> 22:18.075
How are you getting on with Danny?

22:18.160 --> 22:20.435
Danny? Er... Fine.

22:20.520 --> 22:23.080
There's one rule of business -
workmates don't shag.

22:23.160 --> 22:26.675
We're not shagging.
- Yet. Before you do...

22:26.760 --> 22:29.433
there's something you ought to know.

22:30.360 --> 22:33.909
20 quid? I thought I'd be worth
a bit more than that.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.194
My bet with Patrick?

22:37.280 --> 22:39.748
Oh, is that it was?
Proceeds going to Help the Aged?

22:39.840 --> 22:41.671
It wasn't like that.
- Just a bit of fun?

22:41.760 --> 22:43.716
Just a playground prank?

22:45.560 --> 22:49.109
Well, yeah. All right.
Perhaps it was like that at the start.

22:49.200 --> 22:52.829
But that was before I got to know you.
To fall for you.

22:52.920 --> 22:54.831
Oh, for God's sake.

22:54.920 --> 22:58.151
Go on, go on. Say whatever it takes
to get the old girl into bed.

22:58.240 --> 23:00.708
Then tomorrow morning
when we come in to work,

23:00.800 --> 23:03.030
you can have a laugh with your mate Patrick.

23:03.120 --> 23:06.430
You've got it all wrong.
What do you mean ''tomorrow morning''?

23:06.520 --> 23:09.671
What?
- You said ''tomorrow morning''.

23:11.120 --> 23:14.556
You would have slept with me tonight.
- No, I would not!

23:16.160 --> 23:19.630
Well, I'm bloody well not going to now
and you can put money on that!

23:19.720 --> 23:22.837
Oh, and when you see Patrick,
tell him he owes me a tenner.

23:23.520 --> 23:24.999
I already paid him.

23:25.080 --> 23:28.117
Why?
- Cos the bet ran out on Tuesday.

23:29.480 --> 23:31.755
I didn't see you on Tuesday. You cancelled.

23:31.840 --> 23:33.751
Because of the stupid bet.

23:33.840 --> 23:38.277
That was male bravado bollocks, right,
and I went along with it.

23:38.360 --> 23:40.396
But I really like you, Rachel.

23:40.480 --> 23:43.153
I want to get to know you properly.

23:43.240 --> 23:45.196
When the time is right.

23:46.080 --> 23:49.550
And if you thought that was tonight,
then so be it.

23:49.640 --> 23:51.596
Is the bet still on?

23:54.160 --> 23:56.355
Better be a bloody good dinner.

24:00.280 --> 24:02.191
Are you going to the footie this weekend?

24:02.280 --> 24:06.353
Can't. The company's sending me
on one of those Outward Bound courses.

24:06.440 --> 24:08.556
Moulding the management of tomorrow!

24:08.640 --> 24:09.868
What? You?

24:09.960 --> 24:12.679
Hey. How about... Leann Rimes?

24:12.760 --> 24:15.558
Country and Western? No, I don't think so.

24:15.640 --> 24:17.232
Er, classical?

24:17.320 --> 24:19.515
What? For Jenny?
- No, Amy.

24:19.600 --> 24:22.353
What? My Amy?
- You can hardly say that.

24:22.440 --> 24:24.351
What are you buying her a present for?

24:24.440 --> 24:26.396
Er... Friendship.

24:28.560 --> 24:30.994
Adam, she's been very supportive.

24:31.080 --> 24:33.514
She lets me sound off about a lot of things.

24:33.600 --> 24:35.511
Mostly me, I suppose.

24:35.600 --> 24:38.239
I think she would say that was egocentric.

24:38.320 --> 24:41.869
I've no doubt she's got all the lingo.
She spent half her life in therapy.

24:41.960 --> 24:45.748
Hey. She's not nuts.
It's just that you didn't respect her.

24:45.840 --> 24:47.910
Yeah, that's probably right.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.629
Excuse me. Is that tonight's paper?
Can I have a wee look?

24:51.720 --> 24:52.869
I might be in this.

24:52.960 --> 24:54.075
Why? What have you done?

24:54.160 --> 24:56.515
You know, my...my ad.

24:58.320 --> 25:02.552
- Oh, no. Lonely Hearts?
- It's called Meeting Place, actually.

25:02.640 --> 25:04.153
Yeah, right.

25:04.240 --> 25:06.196
Er, yeah.

25:08.160 --> 25:11.118
Oh, no. Idiots! They've cocked up.
It's a misprint.

25:11.200 --> 25:13.111
Yeah, it says 30 years old.

25:13.200 --> 25:15.634
No. Not that bit. Further on there.

25:15.720 --> 25:21.192
''Handsome, bordering on good-looking...
with killer's eyes''?!

25:21.280 --> 25:22.918
It's meant to say ''killer eyes''.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.436
Never mind. Plenty of lifers in Strangeways
get fan mail.

25:26.520 --> 25:30.752
Great. I'll get all the psychos
in Manchester writing to me, then.

25:30.840 --> 25:32.796
Amy is not a psycho, right?

25:36.200 --> 25:38.156
Oh, yeah.

25:41.520 --> 25:43.795
Do we eat loo paper in this house?

25:47.640 --> 25:48.755
Sorry.

25:53.240 --> 25:55.390
Karen.
- Yeah.

25:56.800 --> 26:00.395
There's some man in the bathroom.
- It must be Ramona's boyfriend.

26:00.480 --> 26:02.072
I doubt it. He was washing his hair.

26:02.160 --> 26:04.230
It must be Rachel's new bloke.

26:06.240 --> 26:08.549
Oh, the jailbait... Got to go.

26:09.800 --> 26:12.553
Have a good day, Joshy... And you.

26:13.480 --> 26:15.277
Bye.
- Oh, by the way.

26:15.360 --> 26:19.672
Natalie is going to London this weekend and
she wondered if I knew of any good shows.

26:19.760 --> 26:21.352
Americans enjoy The Mousetrap.

26:22.440 --> 26:24.476
The Mousetrap?

26:24.560 --> 26:26.516
Yup.

26:26.600 --> 26:28.556
David.
- Hello, Rachel.

26:28.640 --> 26:30.995
Morning!
- Oooh!

26:31.080 --> 26:33.036
Good morning.

26:34.400 --> 26:36.356
What?

26:37.120 --> 26:38.758
Where is he?

26:38.840 --> 26:40.813
He's on his way down.

26:41.109 --> 26:43.391
He's a bit embarrassed.
He didn't lock the bathroom door.

26:43.480 --> 26:47.234
It's all right him staying, isn't it?
We didn't want to go back to his place.

26:47.320 --> 26:48.912
Why? Does he still live at home?

26:51.720 --> 26:54.951
Er, Danny... This is Karen.
- Hi.

26:55.040 --> 26:55.995
Hello.

26:57.080 --> 26:58.991
Nice house.
- Thanks very much.

26:59.080 --> 27:02.755
Make yourself at home. Have some breakfast.
There are Coco Pops in the cupboard.

27:02.840 --> 27:06.469
Actually, I think we should be getting to
work. Oh, I meant to give you this.

27:06.560 --> 27:08.357
Ooh. A train ticket?

27:08.440 --> 27:12.228
I was due to go down to London for work
but they changed it to up here.

27:12.320 --> 27:14.117
I thought you might enjoy a day out.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.475
Oh, hang on a minute. I can't.
- Why not?

27:16.560 --> 27:18.790
It's our wedding anniversary that weekend.

27:18.880 --> 27:20.677
So?
- So, I can't go to London.

27:20.760 --> 27:24.673
Yeah, you can. David won't mind.
- No, but I'm taking him on a surprise.

27:24.760 --> 27:26.079
What surprise?

27:26.160 --> 27:28.549
I'm taking him to Paris for the weekend.

27:28.640 --> 27:31.200
But he's taking you to London.
- What?

27:31.280 --> 27:35.239
Look, don't tell David I told you this,
but this is his present to you.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.675
A train ticket?

27:37.760 --> 27:40.991
No, a weekend away!
Karen, he hasn't forgotten.

27:41.080 --> 27:44.629
You're supposed to get the train.
As it pulls out of Piccadilly,

27:44.720 --> 27:48.429
he appears with a big bottle of champagne
and whisks you off to London.

27:48.520 --> 27:50.431
He's got it all planned.

27:50.520 --> 27:54.479
The best hotels, a top-class restaurant,
even a West End show.

27:54.600 --> 27:56.272
The Mousetrap.

27:56.360 --> 27:58.078
You want to see The Mousetrap?

27:58.160 --> 28:00.071
No, I do not.

28:00.160 --> 28:01.513
Go on.

28:01.600 --> 28:04.558
Aw, and you didn't even have to remind him?

28:04.640 --> 28:05.516
No.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.670
Still. I'd rather go to Paris.

28:07.760 --> 28:11.469
No. Karen. No, I've promised him.
- And I can't make him change his mind.

28:11.560 --> 28:13.516
You can't. But his boss can.

28:18.400 --> 28:21.392
So, I told Hal you'd talk to Jerry
about that.

28:21.480 --> 28:24.790
OK... I think that's about it.

28:25.120 --> 28:27.554
Oh, I forgot to give you your ticket.

28:27.640 --> 28:29.551
I'm going somewhere?

28:29.640 --> 28:32.200
Paris. About time you visited
the French office.

28:32.280 --> 28:33.679
Oh. Good idea.

28:33.760 --> 28:36.957
Yeah, it is. You should do that sometime.

28:37.040 --> 28:38.678
Sorry?

28:39.960 --> 28:42.520
Um. OK.
Well, gotta run. Catch you later.

28:42.600 --> 28:44.556
Paris. Great.

28:45.280 --> 28:47.236
Economy?

28:48.000 --> 28:50.878
Natalie, it's my wedding anniversary.

28:51.240 --> 28:53.595
Oh, no.

28:53.880 --> 28:58.590
So, I marched straight into her office
and I said, ''No way, no way!''

28:58.760 --> 29:01.274
I'm sorry, Natalie...
It's out of the question.

29:02.320 --> 29:05.995
I'll have to go some other time.
- No can do. Philippe's expecting you.

29:06.080 --> 29:07.991
I wanted the afternoon off.

29:08.080 --> 29:11.436
Take Monday instead.
What difference does a day make?

29:11.520 --> 29:13.954
It's my wedding anniversary.
It happens once a year.

29:14.040 --> 29:15.632
Not after four marriages.

29:15.720 --> 29:20.271
Look, I'm sorry but your whole itinerary's
been planned. It's too late to change now.

29:20.360 --> 29:22.170
Sorry, I'm afraid you're
going to have to.

29:22.946 --> 29:26.775
This Friday, I shall be leaving at
lunch time and not to go to Paris.

29:27.520 --> 29:30.193
David, don't you think that was
a little bit hasty?

29:30.280 --> 29:33.397
Oh... I thought you'd be pleased.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.436
Yeah. Well, I am.

29:35.520 --> 29:38.910
What do you want the afternoon off
for anyway?

29:39.560 --> 29:42.233
Oh, I don't know.
It's our wedding anniversary.

29:42.320 --> 29:45.915
Oh, David, that's really sweet,
but you've only been in that job a few days.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.195
I think you should make a good impression.

29:48.280 --> 29:50.236
Do you?
- Mm.

29:50.840 --> 29:52.751
It's a courtesy visit. I can go any time.

29:52.840 --> 29:56.833
Besides, I made a stand.
I'm not going to back down now.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.876
David...
- No.

30:01.520 --> 30:03.476
Well, good for you.

30:06.400 --> 30:08.311
You never know.

30:08.400 --> 30:11.710
Natalie might be pleased
you've made a stand.

30:13.400 --> 30:15.356
Yeah.

30:15.680 --> 30:18.478
By the way, did she enjoy The Mousetrap?

30:19.600 --> 30:21.511
Er, yeah. Yeah, I think so.

30:21.600 --> 30:24.637
Thought she might.
Wouldn't be my cup of tea.

30:24.720 --> 30:25.436
No?

30:25.520 --> 30:27.431
Nope.

30:27.520 --> 30:30.512
I'd much rather see Judi Dench's new play.

30:30.600 --> 30:31.874
Judi Dench.

30:31.960 --> 30:34.474
Yeah. At The Almeida.

30:56.800 --> 30:58.119
How did you sleep?

30:59.120 --> 31:01.076
Sleep? Ha!

31:06.240 --> 31:08.117
Oh, yeah.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.919
Excuse me, erm. What time's breakfast?

31:11.000 --> 31:15.471
20 minutes ago. But there'll be
a tea break after the canoeing.

31:17.520 --> 31:20.398
The day started badly and just got worse.

31:22.520 --> 31:24.476
<i>Very amusing, Steven.</i>

31:27.320 --> 31:30.198
Have you seen that train ticket?
I think I put it in here.

31:30.280 --> 31:32.316
But here is for rubbish.
- Yeah, I know.

31:32.400 --> 31:35.153
No. Today is bin day. I have thrown him out.

31:35.240 --> 31:37.196
What?

31:45.720 --> 31:48.154
Karen? What on earth are you doing?

31:50.240 --> 31:52.595
I'm sorting out er... the um...

31:52.680 --> 31:54.272
the recycling.

31:55.760 --> 31:57.239
I'll see you this evening.

31:57.320 --> 31:58.833
Bye!
- Bye.

32:06.880 --> 32:08.791
OK. Very good, everyone.

32:08.880 --> 32:12.236
Hard luck, Pete. Nip back to
your tent for a change of clothes.

32:12.320 --> 32:15.357
Eh? Nobody said bring a change of clothing.

32:18.600 --> 32:20.511
So, did Pete get off all right?

32:20.600 --> 32:24.354
Yeah, he left after work. He was
dreading it. They've got to sleep in tents.

32:24.720 --> 32:28.508
It's his idea of hell not being
near a toilet. Poor sod.

32:28.600 --> 32:30.670
That's why he quit the Scouts.

32:30.760 --> 32:33.399
Oh! Those are the replies to your ad.

32:33.480 --> 32:34.310
Yes!

32:34.400 --> 32:36.356
Yeah, great.

32:37.360 --> 32:39.237
Yes... Maybe...

32:39.320 --> 32:42.596
No... Yeses go first,
then I start with the maybes.

32:42.680 --> 32:44.238
What makes a no?

32:44.320 --> 32:48.552
Er... death threat. Illegible.
From someone called Nigel.

32:48.640 --> 32:52.349
Sounds like a nice bloke, actually.
But I don't like his photo.

32:52.440 --> 32:54.510
They send photos? Fantastic.

32:54.600 --> 32:56.795
Well, um. He'd be a...

32:58.920 --> 33:01.229
Oh. And she's in the maybe pile.

33:01.320 --> 33:04.995
At the bottom. I figured,
if I got that far, I'd be past caring.

33:05.080 --> 33:06.957
What's your first date look like?

33:07.040 --> 33:09.634
UnfortunateIy, the best letter
doesn't have a photo.

33:09.720 --> 33:13.474
So, I had the rather brilliant idea
of phoning her when she was at work,

33:13.800 --> 33:15.597
so I could listen to her voice.

33:15.680 --> 33:18.717
Make sure she doesn't sound like
Janet Street Porter.

33:19.760 --> 33:23.833
<i>Hello. This is Callie.
Sorry I'm not in now...</i>

33:23.920 --> 33:25.638
Hello.
- Hello?

33:25.720 --> 33:28.109
Sorry, the answer machlne's on. Who's that?

33:28.200 --> 33:32.398
Oh, um, hi.
I wasn't expecting you to be there.

33:32.480 --> 33:35.040
Er... This is Adam Williams.

33:36.560 --> 33:38.994
You replied to an ad I put in the paper.

33:39.080 --> 33:42.356
Ah... I know who you are now.

33:42.440 --> 33:45.955
You just wanted to hear what I sound like
before you left a message.

33:46.040 --> 33:49.112
Something like that, yeah.

33:49.200 --> 33:51.953
Nice. Very nice.

33:52.040 --> 33:52.995
Good!

33:53.080 --> 33:55.116
But that doesn't mean anything, does it?

33:55.200 --> 33:58.909
Vanessa Feltz has a nice voice,
but you wouldn't want dinner with her.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.468
Not if you're paying, no.
- No...

34:01.560 --> 34:04.836
Surely the rule is, you go Dutch?
- Yeah, but it's Lonely Hearts.

34:04.920 --> 34:08.435
Meeting Place!
- Dunno. Never done it.

34:08.520 --> 34:10.829
I'll find out soon.
I'm meeting her tomorrow.

34:12.440 --> 34:13.759
OK...

34:13.840 --> 34:18.197
Taramasalata, hummus,
half-eaten pork pie...some dodgy salad.

34:18.280 --> 34:20.350
Hm. You fancy eating out?

34:22.840 --> 34:25.205
Are you buying?
- I'm buying.

34:25.440 --> 34:26.956
Let's go.

34:54.440 --> 34:55.554
Bollocks.

34:55.639 --> 34:58.632
We're being outflanked on the right!
- Who cares? When's lunch?

35:01.280 --> 35:03.236
Amy!

35:10.720 --> 35:12.676
You saved my life.

35:13.280 --> 35:15.191
Yes.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.236
Look out!

35:34.400 --> 35:36.356
So...

35:38.040 --> 35:39.996
I'll see you... later.

35:40.080 --> 35:42.036
Yeah. You will.

36:11.080 --> 36:13.196
Piccadilly Station, please.

36:21.160 --> 36:23.116
Taxi!

36:29.520 --> 36:31.431
OK, then, Joshy.

36:31.520 --> 36:33.670
We're going to have some lunch.

36:33.760 --> 36:36.194
First let's wash those little hands.

36:36.280 --> 36:37.838
Yeah? OK. Come on, then.

36:41.520 --> 36:43.829
Karen, I hope you get this message.

36:43.920 --> 36:45.536
Look, I think you're right.

36:45.881 --> 36:48.596
I don't want to alienate Natalie
so soon after joining the firm.

36:48.680 --> 36:50.591
Not for an afternoon off.

36:50.680 --> 36:52.830
So, look. I'm going to Paris.

36:52.920 --> 36:56.879
I hope you get this message before you...
Erm...

36:56.960 --> 36:58.916
Look, I'll ring later.

37:00.520 --> 37:05.719
<i>We apologise for the late
boarding for the 15:30 to Euston.</i>

37:06.400 --> 37:10.154
<i>This train is now ready
for boarding at platform five.</i>

37:21.040 --> 37:23.918
That's &2.5o, please.

37:24.560 --> 37:25.595
You have to pay?

37:25.680 --> 37:27.636
In Economy you do.

37:33.080 --> 37:35.958
At least
I've got an empty seat next to me.

38:04.920 --> 38:09.789
Believe me, she's not turning up. I'll be
left here like some sad sales rep bastard,

38:09.880 --> 38:12.440
with an expenses account
and no-one to spend it on.

38:12.520 --> 38:14.875
Just stay there. Relax.

38:15.840 --> 38:19.628
The shame of it. Stood up
by a woman who can't get a date.

38:19.720 --> 38:22.473
Well, have a drink.
- I'm having a drink!

38:22.560 --> 38:24.551
Have another one.

38:24.640 --> 38:26.551
Give her half an hour then leave.

38:26.640 --> 38:28.358
It'll be obvious I've been stood up.

38:28.440 --> 38:29.953
Well, I'll come.

38:30.040 --> 38:32.395
Actually, I won't. I've got a baby.

38:32.480 --> 38:36.678
That's OK. There's a cloakroom.
Hang on. This might be her.

38:36.760 --> 38:38.239
She is fit!

38:38.320 --> 38:41.153
She's fat? Adam?

38:44.800 --> 38:49.271
Be for me. Be for me.
Be for me. Be for me...

38:50.840 --> 38:52.910
Bye.

38:57.280 --> 38:58.235
Thank you.

38:58.320 --> 38:59.309
Rachel!

38:59.400 --> 39:01.038
Adam!

39:04.840 --> 39:06.558
Admit it. We're lost.

39:06.640 --> 39:09.279
No, we're not.
The main road is straight ahead.

39:09.360 --> 39:13.433
We don't want the main road.
- Oh, we do. Trust me.

39:16.240 --> 39:18.196
Look, why don't you join us?

39:20.080 --> 39:22.514
Unless you've got someone to meet.

39:22.600 --> 39:25.194
You don't think I'm having dinner on my own,
do you?

39:25.280 --> 39:27.032
Anyone I know?
- No.

39:27.120 --> 39:29.918
Can't be the women I walked in on.
There's only a place for one.

39:42.360 --> 39:43.998
It's a blind date, isn't it?

39:45.520 --> 39:48.910
You've answered an ad in a paper.
- What? A Lonely Hearts?

39:49.000 --> 39:52.834
Meeting Place, actually. No, I haven't.
- You seem to know a lot about it.

39:52.920 --> 39:54.956
Maybe it's his ad.

39:55.040 --> 39:57.076
Oh, my God. It is!

39:57.160 --> 39:59.515
You've put an ad in... How sad!

39:59.600 --> 40:01.431
It's not sad. I'm just...

40:01.520 --> 40:05.399
...trying to increase my social circle.

40:05.480 --> 40:07.755
We'll pretend we don't know you.

40:09.160 --> 40:11.196
I wonder what she looks like.

40:12.920 --> 40:14.353
Probably rather ugly.

40:14.440 --> 40:17.796
You don't know me... OK?

40:18.560 --> 40:20.357
Sorry.

40:25.480 --> 40:27.436
Been waiting long?

40:29.040 --> 40:30.951
Adam? Sorry I'm late.

40:31.040 --> 40:33.554
I couldn't find anywhere
to park the Porsche.

40:37.200 --> 40:40.431
We're supposed to use our initiative, right?

40:40.520 --> 40:42.670
Just up here.

40:44.360 --> 40:46.316
Ha-ha! There you go!

40:48.280 --> 40:50.236
Come on.

40:51.960 --> 40:55.794
You don't want to spend
another night in a tent, do you?

41:00.040 --> 41:01.996
Natalie. It's David.

41:02.120 --> 41:05.669
I just wanted you to know
what a complete washout today has been.

41:05.760 --> 41:08.593
Philippe claimed never to have known
I was coming.

41:08.680 --> 41:11.956
So I told him what I thought of that,
in no uncertain terms,

41:12.040 --> 41:16.272
using a few French words
that I thought I'd forgotten, actually.

41:16.360 --> 41:20.592
Anyway, the little frog hopped off,
and that was the last I saw of him.

41:20.680 --> 41:25.515
His secretary said we'd meet for dinner,
but he's still not shown up.

41:25.600 --> 41:27.795
So, that's it. I'm coming home.

41:28.400 --> 41:32.552
The most galling side of this, Natalie,
is that I do not need to be here.

41:32.640 --> 41:35.089
You knew full well it was my anniversary

41:35.464 --> 41:37.873
and I'm afraid I hold you
responsibIe for ruining it.

41:37.960 --> 41:41.839
Frankly, given the contempt
that you seem to show for such occasions,

41:41.920 --> 41:45.674
it does not surprise me in the least
that you're on to your fourth marriage.

41:45.760 --> 41:49.389
But I am surprised you found four men
foolish enough to marry you.

41:50.720 --> 41:53.553
Natalie, hi. It's Karen.

41:53.640 --> 41:56.632
I just wanted to say thank you very much.

41:56.720 --> 41:59.678
Oh, and er... David's very sorry.

41:59.760 --> 42:01.955
He didn't mean it.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.911
Karen...

42:05.000 --> 42:07.753
May I...join you for dinner?

42:09.360 --> 42:10.998
With Philippe?

42:11.840 --> 42:14.479
Happy wedding anniversary, David.

42:26.960 --> 42:28.712
I've only got a tenner on me.

42:28.800 --> 42:32.076
Oh, fear not. I...used to be a scout.

42:37.320 --> 42:40.118
And will that be a reservation
for one room or two?

42:40.200 --> 42:41.758
Two, please.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.835
We could just have one. If you like.

42:53.320 --> 42:55.231
How do you keep up?

42:55.320 --> 42:59.233
Computers seem to be obsolete
by the time they hit the market.

42:59.320 --> 43:01.390
What?

43:01.480 --> 43:05.109
Bill Gates once said that
if cars had developed so fast,

43:05.200 --> 43:09.512
you could buy one that does
1000 miles to the gallon and cost $25.

43:09.600 --> 43:11.955
What he didn't say is to turn
the headlights on,

43:12.040 --> 43:16.113
you got a message through
telling you to turn the radio off first.

43:16.200 --> 43:17.997
I don't get it.

43:18.080 --> 43:19.991
Oh, it's a computer thing.

43:20.080 --> 43:24.596
About how you have to close down
each programme before...erm...

43:26.160 --> 43:28.276
It doesn't matter.

43:28.360 --> 43:31.477
You seem a little distracted.
- Distracted...

43:31.560 --> 43:35.758
Distracted? Me? God, no. Where am I?
Computers. Brilliant.

43:35.840 --> 43:37.558
Will you stop doing that?

43:38.760 --> 43:41.228
Not you, I mean. Obviously. Callie.

43:41.320 --> 43:43.675
Will you excuse me a minute?

43:45.760 --> 43:48.752
Keep your hands to yourselves.
I'm having a conversation.

43:48.840 --> 43:52.628
Not much of one. - It doesn't
help, having live sex beside me.

43:52.720 --> 43:55.075
You don't like her, do you?
- Why shouldn't I?

43:55.160 --> 43:56.673
Oh, my God. She's awful!

43:56.760 --> 44:00.275
That horrible way she speaks
and the flirty way she steals your sushi.

44:00.360 --> 44:03.477
She's fine. She's great.
And I didn't ask for your opinion.

44:03.560 --> 44:05.790
Stay off computers.
It's a bit of a turn-off.

44:07.240 --> 44:10.198
Or yours! Ssh! Here she comes.

44:12.680 --> 44:14.636
You shit!
- What?

44:14.720 --> 44:18.269
Getting your pals to spy on us.
My friends overheard you talking.

44:18.360 --> 44:22.478
You invited your friends? - I wouldn't
come alone. You might be a pervert.

44:22.560 --> 44:26.075
But I didn't sit them next to us
so they can eavesdrop.

44:26.160 --> 44:28.993
And to think I was going
to invite you back for coffee.

44:36.520 --> 44:38.636
Great... Thanks.

44:38.720 --> 44:39.869
Thanks a million.

44:39.960 --> 44:42.474
Wasn't our fault.
- Besides, we did you a favour.

44:42.560 --> 44:44.630
I don't believe she had a Porsche.

44:44.720 --> 44:46.915
I don't complain about your company.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.468
Meaning what?
- Don't tell me you haven't noticed.

44:49.560 --> 44:52.313
His balls haven't dropped.
- What, you mean he's young?

44:52.400 --> 44:55.949
Young? He ordered off the kiddies' menu.
The wine waiter asked for ID.

44:56.040 --> 44:57.792
You can't stand to see me happy.

44:57.880 --> 45:01.634
You can't stand seeing me with anyone else.
- What crap! I saw you in a threesome!

45:01.720 --> 45:03.597
Yeah. And you wished you were part of it.

45:03.680 --> 45:05.477
Come on. He's jealous you're with me.

45:05.560 --> 45:07.994
As if! Been there, done that.
Got the scars to prove it.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.353
Together?

45:20.200 --> 45:22.111
No... We used to be.

45:22.200 --> 45:24.156
Oh, what? The bill?

45:24.720 --> 45:26.278
Yeah. Why not? Bring it over.

45:26.360 --> 45:28.316
Thank you.

46:42.680 --> 46:44.636
How's the baby?

46:47.320 --> 46:48.958
Oh, good.

46:49.800 --> 46:53.315
Erm... Well, I'll see you
tomorrow then, love, OK?

46:53.400 --> 46:55.470
Yeah... All right. Will do.

46:55.800 --> 46:58.155
Oh... J-Jen?

46:59.240 --> 47:01.151
I love you.

47:01.240 --> 47:03.196
Good night, love.

47:09.720 --> 47:11.676
Everything OK?
- Yeah.
