WEBVTT

00:08.388 --> 00:09.721
DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT

00:09.722 --> 00:11.787
SHOULD BE IMPEACHED?

00:11.788 --> 00:13.520
YES, SIR I DO.

00:13.521 --> 00:14.188
I CAN'T TRUST HIM.

00:14.189 --> 00:18.087
I THINK IT'S AMAZING THAT THE

00:18.088 --> 00:20.887
COUNTRY IS NOT ALREADY FIGHTING

00:20.888 --> 00:21.788
IN THE STREETS.

00:21.789 --> 00:23.520
I THINK IT WILL BE PROVEN HE

00:23.521 --> 00:26.654
IS INNOCENT.

00:26.655 --> 00:28.721
I SINCERELY BELIEVE THAT.

00:28.722 --> 00:30.220
IT'S JUST A SIGN OF A

00:30.221 --> 00:30.788
CRIMINAL ADMINISTRATION.

00:30.789 --> 00:33.721
I THINK IT'S REALLY ROTTEN

00:33.722 --> 00:34.488
THE WAY THEY HAVE BEEN TALKING

00:34.488 --> 00:35.355
ABOUT HIM.

00:35.355 --> 00:36.254
I DON'T BELIEVE PRESIDENT

00:36.255 --> 00:38.287
NIXON HAS COMMITTED ANY

00:38.288 --> 00:39.821
IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE.

00:39.822 --> 00:41.954
THE WATERGATE SCANDAL BROKE

00:41.955 --> 00:42.855
WIDE OPEN TODAY.

00:42.856 --> 00:44.420
THE FORMER WHITE HOUSE

00:44.421 --> 00:47.087
COUNSEL JOHN DEAN.

00:47.088 --> 00:47.722
JOHN DEAN.

00:47.723 --> 00:49.187
THE WHITE HOUSE MASTERMINDED

00:49.188 --> 00:50.253
A COVER UP.

00:50.254 --> 00:51.387
I BEGAN BY TELLING THE

00:51.388 --> 00:52.687
PRESIDENT THAT THERE WAS A

00:52.688 --> 00:57.620
CANCER GROWING ON THE

00:57.621 --> 00:57.922
PRESIDENCY.

00:57.923 --> 01:00.420
THE RESULT OF THE

01:00.421 --> 01:03.120
WHISTLEBLOWER IS PARALLEL TO

01:03.121 --> 01:04.854
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY TESTIMONY 45

01:04.855 --> 01:06.053
OR 50 YEARS AGO.

01:06.054 --> 01:08.087
A WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT

01:08.088 --> 01:09.821
ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE BY AN

01:09.822 --> 01:11.120
INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL CENTERED

01:11.121 --> 01:11.822
ON UKRAINE.

01:11.823 --> 01:13.620
THIS IS TO TAKE DOWN A

01:13.621 --> 01:13.922
PRESIDENT.

01:13.923 --> 01:15.387
THE WHITE HOUSE IS IN CRISIS

01:15.388 --> 01:15.588
MODE.

01:15.589 --> 01:16.787
THE WHITE HOUSE IS IN A STATE

01:16.788 --> 01:18.020
OF SHOCK AND A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:18.021 --> 01:20.253
HERE ARE WONDERING HOW MANY MORE

01:20.254 --> 01:22.987
HEADS ARE GOING TO ROLL.

01:22.988 --> 01:24.520
THE WHITE HOUSE RELEASED THIS

01:24.521 --> 01:26.620
FIVE PAGE ROUGH TRANSCRIPT OF

01:26.621 --> 01:27.521
THAT CALL.

01:27.522 --> 01:30.454
1,300 PAGES OF EDITED

01:30.455 --> 01:31.821
TRANSCRIPTS WERE DELIVERED TO

01:31.822 --> 01:33.687
THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.

01:33.688 --> 01:35.787
WHEN INDIVIDUALS READ THE

01:35.788 --> 01:38.387
ENTIRE TRANSCRIPT THEY MAY REACH

01:38.388 --> 01:38.955
DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS.

01:38.956 --> 01:40.187
THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS

01:40.188 --> 01:43.787
IS THE TRANSCRIPT OF THE ACTUAL

01:43.788 --> 01:44.121
CONVERSATION.

01:44.121 --> 01:44.922
IT WAS PERFECT.

01:44.923 --> 01:49.120
THE COUNTRY TONIGHT IS IN THE

01:49.121 --> 01:51.187
MIDST OF THE MOST SERIOUS

01:51.188 --> 01:52.854
CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS IN IT'S

01:52.855 --> 01:53.121
HISTORY.

01:53.122 --> 01:55.620
THE PRESIDENT HAS PULLED THE

01:55.621 --> 01:57.954
COUNTRY INTO A CONSTITUTIONAL

01:57.955 --> 01:58.188
CRISIS.

01:58.189 --> 02:00.487
I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH VICIOUS

02:00.488 --> 02:02.554
REPORTING IN 27 YEARS OF PUBLIC

02:02.555 --> 02:02.755
LIFE.

02:02.756 --> 02:03.787
IT'S A WHOLE HOAX.

02:03.788 --> 02:04.887
DO YOU KNOW WHO IS PLAYING INTO

02:04.888 --> 02:05.722
THE HOAX?

02:05.722 --> 02:06.221
PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

02:06.222 --> 02:09.487
MUCH OF THE MEDIA IN THIS

02:09.488 --> 02:12.620
COUNTRY IS NOT JUST FAKE.

02:12.621 --> 02:14.354
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE NIXON

02:14.355 --> 02:14.588
YEARS.

02:14.589 --> 02:16.654
IS THIS HISTORY REPEATING

02:16.655 --> 02:17.188
ITSELF?

02:17.189 --> 02:18.554
IS THIS NEW TERRITORY?

02:18.555 --> 02:22.053
THIS PRESIDENT IS MAKING

02:22.054 --> 02:30.054
RICHARD NIXON LOOK LIKE A CHOIR

02:40.521 --> 02:41.521
BOY.

02:58.521 --> 03:00.721
WHAT?

03:00.722 --> 03:02.454
WHAT?

03:02.455 --> 03:02.655
WHAT?

03:02.656 --> 03:05.220
THESE ARE TATER TOTS HOMEMADE.

03:05.221 --> 03:06.954
THEY ARE THE BEST THINGS I HAVE

03:06.955 --> 03:08.620
EVER EATEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

03:08.621 --> 03:09.787
OH, BABY.

03:09.788 --> 03:13.687
ANOTHER FOOD ITEM I HAVE

03:13.688 --> 03:17.687
NEVER SEEN.

03:17.688 --> 03:18.954
ISN'T THAT INSANE?

03:18.955 --> 03:21.520
THAT'S A CLASS ONE NARCOTIC.

03:21.521 --> 03:24.620
THE QUESTION IS HOW BIG ARE

03:24.621 --> 03:26.821
THE RIPPLES AND WHERE ARE THEY

03:26.822 --> 03:27.021
GOING?

03:27.022 --> 03:33.020
THERE'S NO COHERENT STRATEGY.

03:33.021 --> 03:34.721
THEY WERE EITHER UNPREPARED OR

03:34.722 --> 03:35.787
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

03:35.788 --> 03:37.420
SALEM WITCH TRIALS HAVE MORE

03:37.421 --> 03:38.821
DUE PROCESS THAN THIS.

03:38.822 --> 03:39.254
WHAT?

03:39.255 --> 03:41.187
HOW DO YOU KNOW SHE'S A

03:41.188 --> 03:41.388
WITCH?

03:41.389 --> 03:43.987
SOMEBODY TOLD ME SHE'S A WITCH?

03:43.988 --> 03:45.387
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

03:45.388 --> 03:46.654
I READ A ARTICLE THINKING SHE

03:46.655 --> 03:47.655
MIGHT BE A WITCH.

03:47.656 --> 03:49.253
HOW DO YOU EXPECT THE

03:49.254 --> 03:50.821
PRESIDENT'S DEFENSE TO ROLL OUT

03:50.822 --> 03:52.020
GOING FORWARD?

03:52.021 --> 03:53.253
THE DEFENSE OF WHAT?

03:53.254 --> 03:56.687
WELL, THERE'S AN IMPEACHMENT

03:56.688 --> 03:56.955
INQUIRY.

03:56.956 --> 04:00.454
KEVIN McCARTHY GOT CONFRONTED

04:00.455 --> 04:02.420
AND IT WAS CLEAR HE HAD NOT READ

04:02.421 --> 04:03.454
THE TRANSCRIPT.

04:03.455 --> 04:04.787
PRESIDENT TRUMP REPLIES I

04:04.788 --> 04:08.554
WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO US A FAVOR

04:08.555 --> 04:08.788
THOUGH.

04:08.789 --> 04:11.187
YOU JUST ADDED ANOTHER WORD.

04:11.188 --> 04:13.220
NO, IT SAID I'D LIKE YOU TO

04:13.221 --> 04:15.754
DO A FAVOR THOUGH?

04:15.755 --> 04:16.387
YES.

04:16.389 --> 04:22.287
AND THEN THE PRESIDENT GOES

04:22.288 --> 04:27.487
BONKERS ALL THE TIME ON TWITTER.

04:27.488 --> 04:29.420
LISTEN TO THIS INSANE SERIES

04:29.421 --> 04:30.188
OF TWEETS LAST NIGHT.

04:30.189 --> 04:32.620
IF DEMOCRATS ARE SUCCESSFUL IN

04:32.621 --> 04:33.355
REMOVING THE PRESIDENT FROM

04:33.356 --> 04:37.287
OFFICE IT WILL CAUSE A CIVIL WAR

04:37.288 --> 04:38.520
LIKE FRACTURE IN THIS NATION

04:38.521 --> 04:40.454
FROM WHICH OUR COUNTRY WILL

04:40.455 --> 04:43.754
NEVER HEAL.

04:43.755 --> 04:51.487
CIVIL WAR.

04:51.488 --> 04:59.488
AND THEN ACCUSES ADAM SCHIFF OF

04:59.822 --> 05:00.088
TREASON.

05:00.089 --> 05:02.987
WE STILL EXECUTE PEOPLE FOR

05:02.988 --> 05:03.221
TREASON.

05:03.222 --> 05:04.620
HE IS THREATENED AND FEELS THE

05:04.621 --> 05:05.555
PRESIDENT MIGHT BE AT RISK.

05:05.556 --> 05:06.921
THE FACT THAT HE WAS TRYING

05:06.922 --> 05:10.721
TO GET THE UKRAINIANS TO DIG UP

05:10.722 --> 05:11.221
DIRT ABOUT YOU IS THE

05:11.222 --> 05:12.754
ENDORSEMENT OF THE NOTION THAT

05:12.755 --> 05:15.554
HE'S MOST SCARED OF YOU.

05:15.555 --> 05:17.721
THEY'RE GOING TO SAY HE'S

05:17.722 --> 05:18.254
TARNISHED.

05:18.254 --> 05:19.088
WE'RE MOVING ON.

05:19.089 --> 05:20.487
IMPEACHMENT TOOK WHAT HAD

05:20.488 --> 05:22.854
BEEN A TABLE RACE, TOP TIER AND

05:22.855 --> 05:28.287
FROZE IT SOLID FROM THE DEMOCRAT

05:28.288 --> 05:28.588
STANDPOINT.

05:28.589 --> 05:32.454
HOW IS THAT GOING TO CHANGE NOW

05:32.455 --> 05:37.520
I NEEDED SOMETHING NEW IN THIS

05:37.521 --> 05:38.388
EQUATION.

05:38.389 --> 05:40.053
ALL I CAN SAY IS WASHINGTON

05:40.054 --> 05:42.220
D.C. IS GOING TO BE DOMINATED BY

05:42.221 --> 05:42.521
IMPEACHMENT.

05:42.522 --> 05:45.854
THIS KICKS OFF THE INQUIRY IN A

05:45.855 --> 05:48.220
FORMAL SENSE.

05:48.221 --> 05:52.987
I THINK TO HAVE THIS WORK TO OUR

05:52.988 --> 05:54.821
BENEFIT IS TO BE FOCUSED AND GO

05:54.822 --> 05:56.220
FAST AND GET DONE AND WE'LL SEE

05:56.221 --> 05:57.487
WHERE THE CHIPS FALL.

05:57.488 --> 05:59.454
SO THE QUESTION IS HOW ARE

05:59.455 --> 06:00.154
MEMBERS, PARTICULARLY AS

06:00.155 --> 06:01.487
MODERATE DEMOCRATS GOING TO DEAL

06:01.488 --> 06:02.987
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS

06:02.988 --> 06:05.220
WHEN THEY GO HOME ON THE RECESS?

06:05.221 --> 06:06.487
NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE

06:06.488 --> 06:09.153
STRATEGY OF NANCY PELOSI.

06:09.154 --> 06:12.520
SHE DECIDED ALL OF HER CALVARY

06:12.521 --> 06:14.520
IS ON THE FIELD SELLING THIS

06:14.521 --> 06:16.053
IDEA TO HER CONSTITUENTS.

06:16.054 --> 06:17.320
SHE UNDERSTANDS YOU MUST HAVE

06:17.321 --> 06:25.321
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WITH YOU.

06:29.822 --> 06:30.455
IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE THIS FOR

06:30.455 --> 06:31.455
AWHILE TO COME.

06:34.421 --> 06:36.420
CONGRESS IS ON RECESS RIGHT

06:36.421 --> 06:36.588
NOW.

06:36.589 --> 06:38.487
MOST MEMBERS ARE HOME IN THEIR

06:38.488 --> 06:38.788
DISTRICTS.

06:38.789 --> 06:40.387
THE TASK THIS WEEK IS TO TALK

06:40.388 --> 06:42.787
TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND TRY TO

06:42.788 --> 06:45.654
FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY ARE AND

06:45.655 --> 06:46.254
TRY TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT

06:46.255 --> 06:48.120
THEY HAVE POPULAR SUPPORT TO GO

06:48.121 --> 06:48.388
FORWARD.

06:48.389 --> 06:50.354
WE'RE IN NEW YORK TWO HOURS

06:50.355 --> 06:51.687
AWAY FROM NEW YORK CITY.

06:51.688 --> 06:52.987
DONALD TRUMP WON THIS DISTRICT

06:52.988 --> 06:58.754
BY SIX POINTS AND YET IN 2018 A

06:58.755 --> 07:00.120
DEMOCRAT FLIPPED THE DISTRICT

07:00.121 --> 07:02.287
AND WON BY FIVE POINTS.

07:02.288 --> 07:03.821
HE'S A MODERATE DEMOCRAT THAT

07:03.822 --> 07:05.854
WAS ONE OF THE LAST ONES TO COME

07:05.855 --> 07:07.120
OUT FOR IMPEACHMENT.

07:07.121 --> 07:10.387
TONIGHT HE'S TALKING TO HIS

07:10.388 --> 07:11.154
CONSTITUENTS, INEVITABLY THE I

07:11.155 --> 07:12.354
WORD IS GOING TO COME UP.

07:12.355 --> 07:15.987
THIS DISTRICT IS POLITICALLY

07:15.988 --> 07:16.221
DIVERSE.

07:16.222 --> 07:19.721
A THIRD INDEPENDENT, A THIRD

07:19.722 --> 07:21.687
DEMOCRAT, A THIRD REPUBLICAN.

07:21.688 --> 07:23.220
IF WE CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO

07:23.221 --> 07:28.253
FIND COMMON GROUND HERE, I

07:28.254 --> 07:29.687
WORRY.

07:29.688 --> 07:31.053
NOW A LOT HAS HAPPENED IN THE

07:31.054 --> 07:32.087
LAST WEEK IN WASHINGTON.

07:32.088 --> 07:34.787
A NEW SET OF FACTS EMERGED.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.620
THESE SET OF FACTS ARE GROUNDED

07:36.621 --> 07:44.621
IN THE PRESIDENT'S OWN WORDS.

07:45.922 --> 07:48.153
AND BECAUSE ZOF THAT I DECIDED O

07:48.154 --> 07:49.887
MOVE FORWARD AND JOIN MY

07:49.888 --> 07:52.420
COLLEAGUES WITH THE IMPEACHMENT

07:52.421 --> 07:52.688
INQUIRY.

07:52.688 --> 07:53.655
I'M DISAPPOINTED.

07:53.656 --> 07:55.721
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO IDENTIFY THE

07:55.722 --> 07:57.087
EXACT CRIMES THAT YOU THINK HAVE

07:57.088 --> 08:01.620
BEEN COMMITTED, THE CRIME THAT

08:01.621 --> 08:03.253
CAUSES YOU TO THINK IMPEACHMENT.

08:03.254 --> 08:05.153
THE STATUTE MAKES IT PRETTY

08:05.154 --> 08:13.154
CLEAR THAT IT IS A CRIME TO

08:15.421 --> 08:17.187
SOLICIT ANYTHING OF NATIONAL FOR

08:17.188 --> 08:17.822
A PURPOSE.

08:17.823 --> 08:25.823
THAT IS THE LETTER OF THE LAW.

08:26.822 --> 08:29.420
AND THE ABUSE OF POWER REALLY

08:29.421 --> 08:31.387
CREATES A LEVEL OF URGENCY.

08:31.388 --> 08:33.087
DID ANYTHING THE CONGRESSMAN

08:33.087 --> 08:34.687
SAID TONIGHT CONVINCE YOU ONE

08:34.688 --> 08:35.688
WAY OR ANOTHER?

08:35.688 --> 08:36.721
WHERE'S THE CRIME?

08:36.722 --> 08:38.654
WHY NOT LOOK AT JOE BIDEN?

08:38.655 --> 08:40.554
IF YOU LOOK AT THE TRANSCRIPT IT

08:40.554 --> 08:42.419
SAYS THERE'S CORRUPTION IN YOUR

08:42.421 --> 08:43.787
COUNTRY AND MY COUNTRY.

08:43.788 --> 08:44.954
THAT WAS THE DISCUSSION.

08:44.955 --> 08:46.721
DO YOU THINK THE VOTERS OF

08:46.722 --> 08:48.721
THIS DISTRICT ARE MORE ON THIS

08:48.722 --> 08:48.922
SIDE?

08:48.923 --> 08:50.187
THIS IS TRUMP COUNTRY.

08:50.188 --> 08:51.088
YOU KNOW IT.

08:51.089 --> 08:58.287
I KNOW IT.

08:58.288 --> 08:59.687
DO YOU THINK IT'S MAKING A

08:59.688 --> 09:00.088
DIFFERENCE?

09:00.089 --> 09:02.487
I WOULD HOPE IT DOES.

09:02.488 --> 09:03.954
YOU DON'T RUN AWAY FROM IT.

09:03.955 --> 09:05.587
THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS TO BE

09:05.588 --> 09:07.320
COMMITTED AND DEDICATED TO THE

09:07.321 --> 09:14.787
FOLKS THAT YOU SERVE.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.554
IT IS TUESDAY AND WE'RE HERE

09:16.555 --> 09:17.754
IN SAN FRANCISCO EAST BAY.

09:17.755 --> 09:20.420
THE CALIFORNIA 15 DISTRICT

09:20.421 --> 09:24.253
REPRESENTED BY DEMOCRAT ERIC

09:24.254 --> 09:25.654
SWALWELL HOLDING A TOWN HALL

09:25.655 --> 09:27.654
MEETING ON THE TOPIC OF

09:27.655 --> 09:28.655
IMPEACHMENT WITH A SPECIAL GUEST

09:28.656 --> 09:31.520
STAR.

09:31.521 --> 09:32.954
THE JOHN DEAN.

09:32.955 --> 09:34.754
STAR OF THE WATERGATE HEARINGS.

09:34.755 --> 09:36.454
JOHN DEAN IS HERE TO JOIN US

09:36.455 --> 09:37.687
FOR THIS CONVERSATION.

09:37.688 --> 09:39.287
AND NOW THE HISTORICAL VOICE

09:39.288 --> 09:41.253
OF WISDOM ON ALL THINGS

09:41.254 --> 09:49.254
REGARDING IMPEACHMENT.

10:16.355 --> 10:18.387
COVER UPS JUST DON'T WORK AND

10:18.388 --> 10:24.520
WE'RE THE COVER UP.

10:24.521 --> 10:26.554
BETWEEN THE SITUATION OF

10:26.555 --> 10:26.822
WATERGATE.

10:26.823 --> 10:30.387
THE ONE YOU LIVED THROUGH SO

10:30.388 --> 10:30.688
INTIMATELY.

10:30.689 --> 10:31.721
I'M CURIOUS IF YOU CAN TALK A

10:31.722 --> 10:33.220
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PARALLELS.

10:33.221 --> 10:34.420
THERE'S AN INTERESTING

10:34.421 --> 10:36.053
PARALLEL IN THE BUILD UP FOR THE

10:36.054 --> 10:36.955
WHISTLEBLOWER AND WHAT HAPPENED

10:36.956 --> 10:38.320
WITH MY TESTIMONY WHERE THE

10:38.321 --> 10:42.821
WHITE HOUSE WAS ATTACKING ME AND

10:42.822 --> 10:44.120
ONLY MADE ME A MORE INTERESTING

10:44.121 --> 10:45.420
WITNESS TO THE PUBLIC DRAWING

10:45.421 --> 10:47.654
MORE PEOPLE TO WATCH THE

10:47.655 --> 10:48.321
HEARINGS THAN MIGHT HAVE

10:48.321 --> 10:48.955
OTHERWISE DONE SO.

10:48.956 --> 10:53.253
BUT THIS PRESIDENT IS MAKING

10:53.254 --> 10:55.187
RICHARD NIXON LOOK LIKE A CHOIR

10:55.188 --> 10:55.388
BOY.

10:55.389 --> 10:56.620
CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT YOU MEAN

10:56.621 --> 11:00.587
BY THAT?

11:00.588 --> 11:00.755
WHY?

11:00.756 --> 11:02.220
I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH NIXON

11:02.221 --> 11:04.320
THAT I KNEW WHO WAS ALWAYS ON

11:04.321 --> 11:05.487
PRETTY GOOD BEHAVIOR.

11:05.488 --> 11:06.954
IT'S WHEN I LISTEN TO THE TAPES

11:06.955 --> 11:12.320
AND I SAW THE DARK SIDE OF IT.

11:12.321 --> 11:14.921
BUT THE DARKEST RICHARD NIXON I

11:14.922 --> 11:16.554
CAN SEE IN THE ROSE GARDEN WITH

11:16.555 --> 11:18.354
DONALD TRUMP AND THE WAY HE

11:18.355 --> 11:26.220
HANDLES SITUATIONS.

11:26.221 --> 11:27.520
WE HEARD THIS MORNING

11:27.521 --> 11:29.921
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO

11:29.922 --> 11:33.020
PUBLICLY ADMITTED HE WAS ON THE

11:33.021 --> 11:33.988
CALL WITH PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP

11:33.989 --> 11:35.320
AND THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE.

11:35.321 --> 11:36.721
HE DID NOT TELL THE TRUTH FOR

11:36.722 --> 11:38.554
SIX DAYS ABOUT THIS TRANSCRIPT.

11:38.555 --> 11:41.587
MIKE POMPEO HAS BEEN SUBPOENAED

11:41.588 --> 11:49.588
BY AT LEAST THREE COMMITTEES.

11:59.521 --> 12:02.887
WE'RE NOT FROM AROUND HERE

12:02.888 --> 12:03.121
THOUGH.

12:03.122 --> 12:04.887
WE'RE STANDING HERE AT 1,600

12:04.888 --> 12:05.655
PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE WHERE THE

12:05.656 --> 12:10.187
PRESIDENT LIVES.

12:10.188 --> 12:12.220
HIS PRESIDENCY AND WHETHER IT

12:12.221 --> 12:17.887
CONTINUES FORWARD IS AN OPEN

12:17.888 --> 12:18.154
QUESTION.

12:18.155 --> 12:22.153
THE SAGA OF WATERGATE REPRESENTS

12:22.154 --> 12:23.654
A SEISMIC BREAK IN AMERICAN

12:23.655 --> 12:26.620
POLITICS AND WHAT IS SO

12:26.621 --> 12:27.854
CAPTIVATING AND TERRIFYING IS WE

12:27.855 --> 12:29.253
MAY SEE THE BEGINNING OF A

12:29.254 --> 12:31.587
FRACTURE THAT LEADS TO ANOTHER

12:31.588 --> 12:32.555
EARTHQUAKE IN OUR POLITICAL

12:32.555 --> 12:32.788
SYSTEM.

12:32.789 --> 12:34.053
WE ARE WAITING TO SEE

12:34.054 --> 12:36.320
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS

12:36.321 --> 12:37.520
COUNTERPART FROM FINLAND STEP

12:37.521 --> 12:39.187
BEHIND THE PODIUMS AND HE'LL BE

12:39.188 --> 12:40.520
TAKING QUESTIONS.

12:40.521 --> 12:41.987
OUR PRECIOUS SOVEREIGNTY AND

12:41.988 --> 12:43.854
BUILD A GREAT FUTURE OF HOPE,

12:43.855 --> 12:44.954
HARMONY AND PEACE FOR THE

12:44.955 --> 12:46.320
AMERICAN AND FINISH PEOPLE.

12:46.321 --> 12:47.687
APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH.

12:47.688 --> 12:55.688
THANK YOU, SIR.

12:55.755 --> 12:57.387
JOHN ROBERTS.

12:57.388 --> 13:00.153
THIS THREE HOUSE COMMITTEES

13:00.154 --> 13:01.021
GAVE NOTICE TODAY THAT THEY'LL

13:01.022 --> 13:02.520
BE SENDING A SUBPOENA TO THE

13:02.521 --> 13:03.421
WHITE HOUSE FOR DOCUMENTS AND

13:03.422 --> 13:04.454
OTHER MATERIALS.

13:04.455 --> 13:08.220
WILL YOU COOPERATE WITH THOSE?

13:08.221 --> 13:09.287
I ALWAYS COOPERATE.

13:09.288 --> 13:15.721
THIS IS A HOAX BUT WE WILL WORK

13:15.722 --> 13:16.588
TOGETHER.

13:16.589 --> 13:20.020
AND WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS

13:20.021 --> 13:21.520
BECAUSE WE DID ABSOLUTELY.

13:21.521 --> 13:23.554
I HAD A GREAT CALL WITH THE

13:23.555 --> 13:26.620
PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE.

13:26.621 --> 13:28.287
YOU HAVE THE STTRANSCRIPT.

13:28.288 --> 13:29.787
THIS IS MANY PEOPLE ON THE LINE.

13:29.788 --> 13:30.954
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW MANY.

13:30.955 --> 13:31.987
WE'LL FIND OUT I GUESS.

13:31.988 --> 13:36.787
BUT MANY PEOPLE.

13:36.788 --> 13:37.987
MIKE POMPEO WERE ON THE LINE.

13:37.988 --> 13:39.721
DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING BUT BECAUSE

13:39.722 --> 13:42.053
THEY LISTENED.

13:42.054 --> 13:45.754
THERE IS A REPORT THAT CAME OUT

13:45.755 --> 13:47.654
JUST BEFORE YOU WALKED OUT HERE

13:47.655 --> 13:49.354
THAT THE WHISTLEBLOWER MET WITH

13:49.355 --> 13:51.587
THE STAFF MEMBER OF ADAM SCHIFF.

13:51.588 --> 13:52.721
I LOVE THAT QUESTION.

13:52.722 --> 13:55.320
IT SHOWS THAT SCHIFF IS A FRAUD.

13:55.321 --> 13:57.520
I LOVE THAT QUESTION.

13:57.521 --> 13:57.922
THANK YOU, JOHN.

13:57.923 --> 13:59.654
I HATE TO SAY IT'S THE NEW YORK

13:59.655 --> 13:59.922
TIMES.

13:59.923 --> 14:01.020
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY WROTE IT.

14:01.021 --> 14:03.087
JUST HAPPENED AS I'M WALKING UP

14:03.088 --> 14:04.921
HERE THEY HANDED IT TO ME AND I

14:04.922 --> 14:07.187
SAID TO MIKE, WHOA, THAT'S

14:07.188 --> 14:07.455
SOMETHING.

14:07.456 --> 14:09.654
THAT'S BIG STUFF.

14:09.655 --> 14:13.320
I THINK IT'S A SCANDAL THAT HE

14:13.321 --> 14:14.254
KNEW BEFORE.

14:14.254 --> 14:15.254
HE PROBABLY HELPED WRITE IT.

14:15.255 --> 14:16.420
THAT'S WHAT THE WORD IS.

14:16.421 --> 14:20.754
CAN YOU JUST MAKE CLEAR RIGHT

14:20.755 --> 14:22.420
HERE WHAT DO YOU OR WHAT DID YOU

14:22.421 --> 14:24.053
WANT HIM TO DO WITH REGARD TO

14:24.054 --> 14:29.354
JOE AND HUNTER BIDEN?

14:29.355 --> 14:33.253
BIDEN AND HIS SON ARE STONE

14:33.254 --> 14:33.621
COLD CROOKED.

14:33.622 --> 14:35.320
YOU KNOW IT AND SO DO WE.

14:35.321 --> 14:37.053
THE QUESTION WAS WHAT DID YOU

14:37.054 --> 14:38.287
WANT HIM TO DO ABOUT VICE

14:38.288 --> 14:42.020
PRESIDENT BIDEN AND HIS SON

14:42.021 --> 14:42.254
HUNTER?

14:42.255 --> 14:43.520
ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?

14:43.521 --> 14:44.787
IT'S JUST A FOLLOW UP OF WHAT

14:44.788 --> 14:48.654
I JUST ASKED YOU, SIR.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.587
WE HAVE THE PRESIDENT OF

14:50.588 --> 14:50.822
FINLAND.

14:50.822 --> 14:51.755
ASK HIM A QUESTION.

14:51.756 --> 14:53.354
DID YOU HEAR ME?

14:53.355 --> 14:54.088
I DID.

14:54.089 --> 14:55.187
ASK HIM A QUESTION.

14:55.188 --> 14:55.755
I WILL.

14:55.756 --> 14:57.987
I HAVE GIVEN YOU A LONG

14:57.988 --> 14:58.221
ANSWER.

14:58.222 --> 14:59.587
ASK THIS GENTLEMAN A QUESTION.

14:59.588 --> 15:00.787
DON'T BE RUDE.

15:00.788 --> 15:02.153
NO, SIR, I DON'T WANT TO BE

15:02.154 --> 15:02.455
RUDE.

15:02.456 --> 15:04.087
I WANT YOU HAVE TO A CHANCE TO

15:04.088 --> 15:05.887
ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT I ASKED

15:05.888 --> 15:06.221
YOU.

15:06.221 --> 15:07.154
IT'S A WHOLE HOAX.

15:07.155 --> 15:08.320
DO YOU KNOW WHO IS PLAYING INTO

15:08.321 --> 15:08.888
THE HOAX?

15:08.889 --> 15:10.087
PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND THE FAKE

15:10.088 --> 15:11.687
NEWS MEDIA THAT WE HAVE IN THIS

15:11.688 --> 15:15.253
COUNTRY AND I SAY IN MANY CASES

15:15.254 --> 15:16.054
THE CORRUPT MEDIA BECAUSE YOU'RE

15:16.054 --> 15:16.521
CORRUPT.

15:16.522 --> 15:17.754
MUCH OF THE MEDIA IN THIS

15:17.755 --> 15:18.987
COUNTRY IS NOT JUST FAKE.

15:18.988 --> 15:24.087
IT'S CORRUPT.

15:24.088 --> 15:24.621
THANK YOU VERY MUCH,

15:24.622 --> 15:32.620
EVERYBODY.

15:32.621 --> 15:36.053
DO YOU KNOW WHO IT IS MR.

15:36.054 --> 15:36.355
PRESIDENT.

15:36.356 --> 15:37.954
MOST HAVE A WAR ROOM STAFFED

15:37.955 --> 15:39.053
WITH LAWYERS DOING RAPID

15:39.054 --> 15:39.421
RESPONSE.

15:39.422 --> 15:41.354
WHAT IS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR IS THE

15:41.355 --> 15:42.854
PRESIDENT BELIEVES HIS BEST

15:42.855 --> 15:50.520
DEFENSE IS HIMSELF.

15:50.521 --> 15:53.354
NOW HE HAS SEIZED UPON NEWS THAT

15:53.355 --> 15:56.687
BROKE THAT ADAM SCHIFF WAS

15:56.688 --> 15:58.120
CONTACTED BY THE WHISTLEBLOWER.

15:58.121 --> 15:59.554
HE CONTACTED FOR GUIDANCE AND

15:59.555 --> 16:01.220
HOW TO REPORT POSSIBLE WRONG

16:01.221 --> 16:01.555
DOING.

16:01.556 --> 16:03.620
AT NO POINT DID THE COMMITTEE

16:03.621 --> 16:05.320
REVIEW OR RECEIVE THE COMPLAINT

16:05.321 --> 16:13.321
IN ADVANCE.

16:19.054 --> 16:20.487
NINE OF THE DEMOCRATIC

16:20.488 --> 16:23.487
CANDIDATES ARE HERE.

16:23.488 --> 16:25.287
YOU'RE HERE TALKING ABOUT GUN

16:25.288 --> 16:25.555
VIOLENCE.

16:25.556 --> 16:26.854
THE REST OF THE COUNTRY

16:26.855 --> 16:27.887
ARGUABLY, ALL ANYBODY IS TALKING

16:27.888 --> 16:29.687
ABOUT IS IMPEACHMENT.

16:29.688 --> 16:31.620
YOU SAID YOU THOUGHT HE PROBABLY

16:31.621 --> 16:32.987
DESERVED IMPEACHMENT.

16:32.988 --> 16:34.721
DOES HE DEFINITELY DESERVE

16:34.722 --> 16:35.088
IMPEACHMENT NOW?

16:35.088 --> 16:36.088
YEAH.

16:36.089 --> 16:37.887
I THINK HE LEFT CONGRESS WITH NO

16:37.888 --> 16:38.121
CHOICE.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.454
THE PRESIDENT CONFESSED TO AN

16:39.455 --> 16:43.187
ABUSE OF POWER ON NATIONAL

16:43.188 --> 16:43.488
TELEVISION.

16:43.489 --> 16:46.487
IF THERE'S NO ACCOUNTABILITY FOR

16:46.488 --> 16:49.120
THAT, THAT WILL HARM AFTER THIS

16:49.121 --> 16:50.220
PRESIDENT AND THOSE AFTER HIM.

16:50.221 --> 16:52.454
MOST MEDIA AND PEOPLE DON'T

16:52.455 --> 16:54.520
SAY HUNTER BIDEN BROKE ANY LAWS

16:54.521 --> 16:56.020
AND IF YOU'RE PRESIDENT OR VICE

16:56.021 --> 16:56.788
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

16:56.788 --> 16:57.722
WOULD YOU THINK IT APPROPRIATE

16:57.723 --> 16:59.420
TO HAVE YOUR SON OR DAUGHTER

16:59.421 --> 17:01.153
SERVING ON THE BOARD IN A

17:01.154 --> 17:03.687
FOREIGN COUNTRY THAT HAS

17:03.688 --> 17:08.287
SENSITIVE NATIONAL SECURITY

17:08.288 --> 17:08.521
ISSUES.

17:08.521 --> 17:10.087
WOULD YOU ALLOW THEM TO SERVE

17:10.088 --> 17:11.619
ON THE BOARD OF A COUNTRY?

17:11.621 --> 17:12.820
I WOULD HOLD MYSELF AND

17:12.821 --> 17:13.854
EVERYBODY IN MY ADMINISTRATION

17:13.855 --> 17:15.787
TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS.

17:15.788 --> 17:17.954
AND AT THE SAME TIME, I THINK

17:17.954 --> 17:18.954
GETTING SUCKED INTO THIS

17:18.955 --> 17:20.854
CONVERSATION NOW, VALIDATES THE

17:20.855 --> 17:22.387
PRESIDENT'S BELIEF THAT HE CAN

17:22.387 --> 17:24.053
THROW OUT A SHINY OBJECT AND

17:24.054 --> 17:32.054
CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

17:36.188 --> 17:38.187
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT

17:38.188 --> 17:39.253
WE HEAR IN SEVERAL DAYS.

17:39.254 --> 17:41.153
ON HIS MIND, THE PRESIDENT'S

17:41.154 --> 17:41.922
ATTACKS ON HIS FAMILY.

17:41.923 --> 17:49.020
ALL EYES ARE INDEED ON JOE

17:49.021 --> 17:49.221
BIDEN.

17:49.222 --> 17:51.654
LET ME MAKE SOMETHING CLEAR

17:51.655 --> 17:54.687
TO MR. PRESIDENT AND HIS HATCHET

17:54.688 --> 17:56.220
MEN, I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

17:56.221 --> 17:57.654
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DESTROY ME.

17:57.655 --> 18:05.053
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DESTROY MY

18:05.054 --> 18:05.288
FAMILY.

18:05.289 --> 18:07.187
A LOT OF MY OPPONENTS SAY WE

18:07.188 --> 18:08.954
HAVE TO DO MORE THAN JUST BEAT

18:08.955 --> 18:09.555
DONALD TRUMP.

18:09.556 --> 18:11.220
I AGREE.

18:11.221 --> 18:16.454
WE HAVE TO BEAT HIM LIKE A DRUM.

18:16.455 --> 18:19.020
GOD BLESS YOU ALL.

18:19.021 --> 18:23.153
MAY GOD BLESS OUR TROOPS.

18:23.154 --> 18:30.954
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

18:30.955 --> 18:33.354
WHAT EXACTLY DID YOU HOPE HE

18:33.355 --> 18:34.854
WOULD DO ABOUT THE BIDENS AFTER

18:34.855 --> 18:35.822
YOUR PHONE CALL?

18:35.823 --> 18:37.420
I WOULD THINK IF THEY WERE

18:37.421 --> 18:38.620
HONEST ABOUT IT THEY WOULD START

18:38.621 --> 18:40.420
A MAJOR INVESTIGATION INTO THE

18:40.421 --> 18:40.655
BIDENS.

18:40.656 --> 18:43.120
AND BY THE WAY, LIKEWISE, CHINA

18:43.121 --> 18:44.887
SHOULD START AN INVESTIGATION

18:44.888 --> 18:49.454
INTO THE BIDENS.

18:49.455 --> 18:50.487
BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED IN CHINA

18:50.488 --> 18:52.220
IS JUST ABOUT AS BAD AS WHAT

18:52.221 --> 18:57.120
HAPPENED WITH UKRAINE.

18:57.121 --> 18:58.821
I HAVE IT BUT CERTAINLY

18:58.822 --> 19:02.053
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN START

19:02.054 --> 19:02.588
THINKING ABOUT.

19:02.589 --> 19:10.589
IT IS TRULY REMARKABLE.

19:10.621 --> 19:12.454
PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLING ON

19:12.455 --> 19:14.287
TWO DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTS.

19:14.288 --> 19:16.153
THE PRECISE ACCUSATION

19:16.154 --> 19:18.487
CONGRESS IS INVESTIGATING.

19:18.488 --> 19:19.620
METTLE IN AMERICAN POLITICS

19:19.621 --> 19:27.621
ON HIS BEHALF.

19:39.221 --> 19:40.487
I'M AT THE STAGE OF THE

19:40.488 --> 19:41.821
CAMPAIGN WHERE I'M LIKE I'M JUST

19:41.822 --> 19:43.787
GOING TO ENGAGE IN REAL TALK.

19:43.788 --> 19:45.053
I DON'T WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME

19:45.054 --> 19:46.287
WITH ANYTHING ELSE.

19:46.288 --> 19:54.288
SO REAL TALK, DUDE GOT TO GO.

19:56.588 --> 19:57.455
DUDE GOT TO GO.

19:57.456 --> 19:59.153
DO YOU THINK BECAUSE OF YOUR

19:59.154 --> 20:05.787
BACKGROUND THAT YOU HAVE UNIQUE

20:05.788 --> 20:07.554
INSIGHTS INTO THIS SCENARIO?

20:07.555 --> 20:11.053
I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE

20:11.054 --> 20:12.320
ACCOUNTABILITY TO THIS.

20:12.321 --> 20:16.987
YOU COULDN'T BEAT ME AT THE

20:16.988 --> 20:20.053
BALLOT BOX AND YOU'RE

20:20.054 --> 20:21.620
MANUFACTURING A COO.

20:21.621 --> 20:22.987
SOMETIMES WE JUST NEED TO GET

20:22.988 --> 20:30.988
OUT OF DONALD TRUMP'S HEAD.

20:31.722 --> 20:34.087
TO GO INTO HIS HEAD IS TO SAY

20:34.088 --> 20:35.654
I CAN SHOOT ANYBODY ON FIFTH

20:35.655 --> 20:38.554
AVENUE AND GET AWAY WITH IT.

20:38.555 --> 20:41.987
I CAN DO IT IN PUBLIC INCLUDING

20:41.988 --> 20:45.454
THE LAWN OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND

20:45.455 --> 20:48.287
CALL ON XI JINGPING AND SAY

20:48.288 --> 20:49.221
RUSSIA IF YOU'RE LISTENING.

20:49.222 --> 20:50.921
THIS GUY TOLD US ABOUT HIS

20:50.922 --> 20:51.154
METHODS.

20:51.155 --> 20:52.754
GUESS WHAT, IF YOU SHOOT

20:52.755 --> 20:54.387
SOMEBODY ON FIFTH AVENUE, IF

20:54.388 --> 20:55.821
THERE'S 1,000 WITNESSES OR NO

20:55.822 --> 21:00.754
WITNESSES IT'S STILL A CRIME.

21:00.755 --> 21:02.887
YOU'D LIKE TO SEE TRANSCRIPTS

21:02.888 --> 21:04.921
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND XI,

21:04.922 --> 21:05.121
RIGHT?

21:05.122 --> 21:07.220
THERE MAY BE FURTHER EVIDENCE

21:07.221 --> 21:09.654
OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

21:09.655 --> 21:11.420
STATES BEING IN CAHOOTS WITH THE

21:11.421 --> 21:13.020
HEAD OF A FOREIGN NATION.

21:13.021 --> 21:14.053
HE IS LAWLESS.

21:14.054 --> 21:15.454
EVERY DAY IN AMERICA PEOPLE ARE

21:15.455 --> 21:17.320
WALKING TO COUNTY COURTHOUSES,

21:17.321 --> 21:19.053
CITY COURTHOUSES, FEDERAL

21:19.054 --> 21:20.120
COURTHOUSES AND THEY'RE SUPPOSED

21:20.121 --> 21:22.387
TO BE CONVINCED THAT JUSTICE

21:22.388 --> 21:23.520
HAPPENS IN AMERICA AND THAT THE

21:23.521 --> 21:31.387
LAW APPLIES EQUALLY TO EVERYONE.

21:31.388 --> 21:33.187
WELL, IF WE DON'T FIGHT FOR THAT

21:33.188 --> 21:34.687
WHY SHOULD ANYBODY ELSE BELIEVE

21:34.688 --> 21:40.687
THE SYSTEM HAS INTEGRITY.

21:40.688 --> 21:46.654
WE ARE IN TEMPLETON, IOWA.

21:46.655 --> 21:54.053
MORE ACRES OF CORN THAN HUMAN

21:54.054 --> 21:54.288
BEINGS.

21:54.289 --> 21:56.987
THE REPUBLICAN SENATOR FROM IOWA

21:56.988 --> 21:57.655
IS UP FOR ELECTION IN 2020 AND

21:57.656 --> 22:00.020
WIDELY SEEN AS ONE OF THE MOST

22:00.021 --> 22:08.021
VULNERABLE SEATS IN THE

22:10.021 --> 22:10.288
ELECTION.

22:10.289 --> 22:18.289
IT GETS TOO LOUD TO IGNORE.

22:20.021 --> 22:22.654
AND PUT IN A VERY COMFORTABLE

22:22.655 --> 22:24.220
POSITION BY THE LEADER OF THEIR

22:24.221 --> 22:24.455
PARTY.

22:24.456 --> 22:25.787
I HAD MANY PERSONAL

22:25.788 --> 22:26.854
CONVERSATIONS ON THE PHONE WITH

22:26.855 --> 22:28.287
THE PRESIDENT AS WELL AS

22:28.288 --> 22:29.620
MEETINGS AND THE OVAL OFFICE

22:29.621 --> 22:34.220
WITH HIM AS WELL TALKING HOW WE

22:34.221 --> 22:40.387
MOVE FORWARD AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL

22:40.388 --> 22:42.020
HAVE IT RESOLVED THIS WEEK.

22:42.021 --> 22:42.321
THANK YOU.

22:42.322 --> 22:43.721
YOU STARTED TALKING ABOUT

22:43.722 --> 22:46.954
CHINA A LITTLE BIT AGO, ABOUT

22:46.955 --> 22:50.587
HAVING TO WORK WITH CHINA.

22:50.588 --> 22:52.387
WE HAVE PEOPLE BANKRUPT AND

22:52.388 --> 22:55.387
SOUTHWEST IOWA UNDER WATER AND

22:55.388 --> 22:56.754
YET TODAY, JUST THIS MORNING WE

22:56.755 --> 23:00.287
HAVE PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYING, OH,

23:00.288 --> 23:02.454
WE NEED TO TALK TO PRESIDENT XI

23:02.455 --> 23:04.420
AND HAVE HIM INVESTIGATE JOE

23:04.421 --> 23:04.621
BIDEN.

23:04.622 --> 23:09.120
HOW IS THAT HELPING ANYBODY?

23:09.121 --> 23:12.020
YOU KNOW?

23:12.021 --> 23:12.822
WHERE IS THE LINE?

23:12.823 --> 23:14.921
WHEN ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO SAY

23:14.922 --> 23:15.154
ENOUGH?

23:15.155 --> 23:16.587
BECAUSE WE CONSTANTLY HAVE

23:16.588 --> 23:18.120
ANYBODY, OH, WELL, IT'S NOT

23:18.121 --> 23:21.754
THIS, IT'S NOT THAT OR

23:21.755 --> 23:22.821
EVERYTHING ELSE AND YET YOU

23:22.822 --> 23:24.487
STILL STAND THERE SILENT AND

23:24.488 --> 23:28.287
YOUR SILENCE IS SUPPORTING HIM

23:28.288 --> 23:34.053
IN NOT STANDING UP.

23:34.054 --> 23:34.555
GOOD QUESTION.

23:34.556 --> 23:37.721
SO I CAN SAY YAY, NAY, WHATEVER,

23:37.722 --> 23:38.921
THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO SAY

23:38.922 --> 23:40.420
WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO

23:40.421 --> 23:40.988
DO.

23:40.989 --> 23:43.220
I UNDERSTAND IT'S A NON-ANSWER

23:43.221 --> 23:44.121
ANSWER AND I UNDERSTAND.

23:44.121 --> 23:45.088
I GET IT.

23:45.089 --> 23:46.354
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

23:46.355 --> 23:47.987
I'LL JUST SAY THAT I CAN'T

23:47.988 --> 23:48.655
SPEAK FOR HIM.

23:48.656 --> 23:50.020
I KNOW YOU CAN'T SPEAK FOR

23:50.021 --> 23:51.387
HIM BUT YOU CAN SPEAK FOR

23:51.388 --> 23:51.655
YOURSELF.

23:51.656 --> 23:57.921
AND I DO.

23:57.922 --> 23:58.521
WHAT ABOUT WHISTLEBLOWERS?

23:58.521 --> 23:59.154
I ALREADY SAID WHISTLEBLOWERS

23:59.155 --> 24:06.053
SHOULD BE PROTECTED.

24:06.054 --> 24:08.020
YOU HAVE TO SEA IT FOR OUR

24:08.021 --> 24:09.153
MEDIA TO COVER IT.

24:09.154 --> 24:11.187
WHISTLE-BLOWERS SHOULD BE

24:11.188 --> 24:11.488
PROTECTED.

24:11.489 --> 24:14.687
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

24:14.688 --> 24:16.220
PLEASE LET FOLKS OUT THERE KNOW.

24:16.221 --> 24:17.754
OUR PRESIDENT SHOULD NOT BE

24:17.755 --> 24:20.554
ENCOURAGING OTHER COUNTRIES TO

24:20.555 --> 24:21.854
INVESTIGATE HIS POLITICAL

24:21.855 --> 24:22.088
RIVALS.

24:22.089 --> 24:23.220
I WOULD SAY TO THAT

24:23.221 --> 24:26.887
CORRUPTION NO MATTER WHERE IT IS

24:26.888 --> 24:27.355
SHOULD BE OUT.

24:27.356 --> 24:30.420
BUT IT'S OKAY TO EXTORT OTHER

24:30.421 --> 24:30.755
COUNTRIES.

24:30.755 --> 24:31.188
NO.

24:31.189 --> 24:33.087
OKAY, WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON

24:33.088 --> 24:33.955
TO ANOTHER QUESTION BUT WHAT I

24:33.956 --> 24:37.687
WOULD SAY IS WE CAN'T DETERMINE

24:37.688 --> 24:44.187
THAT YET.

24:44.188 --> 24:45.354
ARE SENATE REPUBLICANS

24:45.355 --> 24:46.321
TALKING AMONG THEMSELVES ABOUT

24:46.321 --> 24:47.321
THEIR OWN CONCERNS WITH

24:47.322 --> 24:48.487
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THIS MOMENT?

24:48.488 --> 24:50.587
WELL, I HAVEN'T VISITED WITH

24:50.588 --> 24:52.420
OTHERS ABOUT THEIR CONCERNS.

24:52.421 --> 24:54.354
WE DID HAVE A DISCUSSION.

24:54.355 --> 24:55.921
IT'S BEEN ABOUT A WEEK AGO.

24:55.922 --> 25:00.153
YOU KNOW, HE MADE IT VERY CLEAR

25:00.154 --> 25:01.121
THAT ALL THE INFORMATION, IT

25:01.122 --> 25:03.253
WILL COME FORWARD AND IT WILL GO

25:03.254 --> 25:04.721
TO THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE

25:04.722 --> 25:05.588
COMMITTEE BUT I WANT EVERYBODY

25:05.589 --> 25:07.987
TO TALK AWAY THAT IT'S BEING

25:07.988 --> 25:15.988
APPROACHED IN A CALM RATIONAL

25:29.555 --> 25:30.288
MANNER.

25:30.289 --> 25:35.987
HE RE-SIGNED LAST FRIDAY.

25:35.988 --> 25:37.854
TEXT MESSAGES OBTAINED IN

25:37.855 --> 25:39.287
THE HEARING HAVE BEEN VERY

25:39.288 --> 25:39.588
REVEALING.

25:39.589 --> 25:42.954
THESE TEXTS SPEAK DIRECTLY TO

25:42.955 --> 25:45.687
THE ISSUE AT THE HEART OF THE

25:45.688 --> 25:46.188
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY.

25:46.189 --> 25:48.020
ARE WE SAYING THAT IT'S

25:48.021 --> 25:50.387
CONDITIONED ON INVESTIGATIONS?

25:50.388 --> 25:53.754
HOW MANY MORE SMOKING GUNS ARE

25:53.755 --> 25:54.588
THERE?

25:54.589 --> 25:58.987
WHAT WAS YOUR MESSAGE TO THE

25:58.988 --> 26:06.988
COMMITTEE, SIR?

26:10.021 --> 26:11.787
WELL, I WOULDN'T MIND AND

26:11.788 --> 26:13.320
WE'LL GET IT IF WE'RE GOING TO

26:13.321 --> 26:13.488
WIN.

26:13.489 --> 26:21.489
THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN VERY

26:26.521 --> 26:26.755
UNIFIED.

26:26.756 --> 26:28.220
IT'S WRONG AND APPALLING.

26:28.221 --> 26:29.787
IT'S A DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE

26:29.788 --> 26:31.520
PRESIDENT'S COMMENT ON THE SOUTH

26:31.521 --> 26:31.755
GROUND.

26:31.756 --> 26:32.887
THIS IS A CRITICAL MOMENT IN

26:32.888 --> 26:36.721
THE HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN

26:36.722 --> 26:41.053
REPUBLICAN PARTY.

26:41.054 --> 26:42.287
WE'RE GOING TO BRING THIS

26:42.288 --> 26:44.187
WEEK TO AN END WITH TWO OF THE

26:44.188 --> 26:47.854
MORE INFLUENTIAL CONSERVATIVE

26:47.855 --> 26:48.822
POLITICAL ONES.

26:48.823 --> 26:50.120
ONE IS BILL CRYSTAL THAT FOUNDED

26:50.121 --> 26:53.320
THE WEEKLY STAD MAGAZINE WHICH

26:53.321 --> 26:56.387
WAS THE DEFINING MAGAZINE OF THE

26:56.388 --> 26:56.822
90s.

26:56.823 --> 26:58.721
HE'S MOST FAMOUS FOR HIS TIME AS

26:58.722 --> 27:01.153
A SPEECH WRITER DURING THE

27:01.154 --> 27:02.754
SECOND BUSH ADMINISTRATION.

27:02.755 --> 27:05.754
THEY'RE ANTI-TRUMP.

27:05.755 --> 27:07.487
THEY HAVE UNIQUE INSIGHT ON

27:07.488 --> 27:09.287
WHETHER THE LOYALTY WE HAVE SEEN

27:09.288 --> 27:10.687
AMONG REPUBLICANS IS LIKELY TO

27:10.688 --> 27:14.954
HOLD OR MAYBE THE DAM COULD

27:14.955 --> 27:15.188
CRACK.

27:15.189 --> 27:16.787
LAST WEEK WAS THE WEEK WE

27:16.788 --> 27:19.787
WENT FROM THERE'S NO WAY IN

27:19.788 --> 27:20.421
WHICH DONALD TRUMP IS EVER GOING

27:20.422 --> 27:22.220
TO BE IMPEACHED TO PRETTY LIKELY

27:22.221 --> 27:23.354
HE'S GOING TO BE IMPEACHED.

27:23.355 --> 27:24.821
WE WENT FROM DONALD TRUMP'S

27:24.822 --> 27:26.354
LIKELY TO BE IMPEACHED TO ITS

27:26.355 --> 27:27.787
KIND OF INEVITABLE NOW THAT

27:27.788 --> 27:30.420
DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO BE

27:30.421 --> 27:30.688
IMPEACHED.

27:30.689 --> 27:32.053
AT LEAST THAT'S MY PROPOSITION.

27:32.054 --> 27:33.220
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?

27:33.221 --> 27:35.287
WAS INSISTING ON BEING

27:35.288 --> 27:35.555
IMPEACHED.

27:35.556 --> 27:37.454
HE WON'T LET ANYBODY NOT IMPEACH

27:37.455 --> 27:37.621
HIM.

27:37.622 --> 27:40.487
EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE SOME MEMBER

27:40.488 --> 27:41.954
OF CONGRESS IS WANDERING OFF AND

27:41.955 --> 27:43.387
FIGURING THERE'S A WAY OUT OF IT

27:43.388 --> 27:46.020
BUT WHEN HE SAYS NO, NO, THIS

27:46.021 --> 27:54.021
WILL ONLY END ONE WAY.

27:55.521 --> 28:03.521
NOW WE HAVE JGIULANI AND

28:04.088 --> 28:05.088
POMPEO AND BAR.

28:05.089 --> 28:06.120
THEY'RE TWO OF THE MOST

28:06.121 --> 28:07.687
IMPORTANT IN SENIOR CABINET

28:07.688 --> 28:08.821
POSITIONS IN THE GOVERNMENT

28:08.822 --> 28:10.687
ACTING AS HIS AGENTS IN THIS AND

28:10.688 --> 28:18.688
THAT'S IMPORTANT I THINK.

28:19.722 --> 28:22.287
IT'S THE U.S. GOVERNMENT PUT

28:22.288 --> 28:24.087
AT HIS PERSONAL DISPOSAL.

28:24.088 --> 28:28.654
THOSE TWEETS, DOES IT STRIKE

28:28.655 --> 28:29.188
AZARENKA

28:29.188 --> 28:29.621
YOU AS A MOMENT?

28:29.622 --> 28:32.287
THIS IS A REALLY BIG DEAL.

28:32.288 --> 28:34.454
TRUMP'S MARGIN OF ERROR IS

28:34.455 --> 28:35.554
SMALLER THAN PEOPLE THINK.

28:35.555 --> 28:37.754
IT'S TRUE IT TAKES THEM TO

28:37.755 --> 28:45.755
CONVICT THEM BUT IF THEY SAY WE

28:50.288 --> 28:51.821
HAVE TO HAVE A REAL TRIAL, WE

28:51.822 --> 28:54.587
HAVE TO HAVE A REAL TRIAL.

28:54.588 --> 28:56.320
IT'S SHAPING A 2020 ELECTION SO

28:56.321 --> 28:59.887
PEOPLE SEE WHAT IT IS THEY'RE

28:59.888 --> 29:07.888
GOING THROUGH.

29:16.521 --> 29:18.120
THEY DON'T LIKE TRUMP AND THAT

29:18.121 --> 29:19.887
COULD BE REALLY DANGEROUS TO THE

29:19.888 --> 29:20.154
COUNTRY.

29:20.154 --> 29:21.088
THIS MIGHT BE THE MOMENT THAT

29:21.089 --> 29:25.287
THEY STEP UP AND SAY, YOU KNOW,

29:25.288 --> 29:26.288
TOO MUCH.
