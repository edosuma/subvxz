By looking at the full moon,

00:07.091 --> 00:10.424
Gohan transformed into a
Great Ape for the first time.

00:10.511 --> 00:13.719
In order to defuse his tremendous power,

00:13.806 --> 00:17.344
Piccolo destroyed the entire moon...

00:20.020 --> 00:24.138
...and plucked out Gohan's tail.

00:24.233 --> 00:27.817
I have to go attend to my
own training, so I'm leaving.

00:29.613 --> 00:34.528

03:35.257 --> 03:39.170
Oh, it's you again?
You'll never learn, will you?

03:59.239 --> 04:04.108
Hey! I'm over here! Nyah-nyah!

04:16.798 --> 04:20.255
Okay, I'm going to get some more meat now!

04:26.266 --> 04:29.724
Your tail is going to be all gone before long.

04:46.286 --> 04:49.653
Hmph, looks like he's
gotten a little more favorable.

04:56.338 --> 05:00.502
A-Ain't | to Kaio-sama's place yet?

05:13.271 --> 05:15.523
Well, with this many people on our team,

05:15.607 --> 05:18.189
I'm not at all frightened by those Saiyans.

05:18.276 --> 05:21.985
I can't wait to see what kind of
training Kami-sama will give us.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.608
Mm-hmm.

05:35.419 --> 05:37.626
We've been apart for half the year now.

05:37.713 --> 05:40.125
You look like you've gotten
a little more favorable.

05:41.800 --> 05:45.258
Now then, time to start actually
putting you through the wringer.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.801
Come at me!

05:56.023 --> 05:57.559
What's wrong with you?!

06:00.694 --> 06:02.150
Over here!

06:03.447 --> 06:05.108
Do not lose sight of your target!

06:05.198 --> 06:08.065
I can't see anything move that fast!

06:08.160 --> 06:11.368
You don't see it. You feel it.

06:11.455 --> 06:14.037
Yeah, that's easy for you to say...

06:14.124 --> 06:15.864
Ow-w-w-w!

06:27.596 --> 06:30.508
I still ain't able to see the end?

07:07.552 --> 07:09.463
The tail!

07:09.554 --> 07:12.967
I did it! I made it!

07:13.058 --> 07:15.891
Yahoo!

07:28.448 --> 07:29.984
Huh?

07:32.786 --> 07:34.742
There's nothing here!

07:38.917 --> 07:41.499
Aw, man, you're kidding!

07:43.421 --> 07:45.286
What's that?

07:49.261 --> 07:53.595
That's it! That's where Kaio-sama is!

07:53.682 --> 07:55.968
Yahoo!

08:09.281 --> 08:13.115
Sure enough! There's a house there!

08:18.165 --> 08:19.951
What?! What?! What?!

08:27.382 --> 08:30.874
W-What's wrong with the ground here?

08:33.763 --> 08:35.628
Damn...

08:38.434 --> 08:45.056
Incredible! It's like I'm being sucked
down by an unbelievable power!

08:45.150 --> 08:52.693
l-lt's no use! It's like my body
is as heavy as lead! Damn it...!

09:01.374 --> 09:07.745
I finally... made it this far...

09:07.839 --> 09:13.926
I'm... going to meet...
Kaio-sama... no matter what!

09:14.012 --> 09:18.255
A little farther... a little farther...

09:20.143 --> 09:22.600
Just a little farther...

09:26.024 --> 09:29.391
But before I do, I'm gonna
find something to eat.

09:46.169 --> 09:48.876
Yow-w-w-w...

10:00.850 --> 10:05.435
K-Kaio-sama? Are you Kaio-sama?

10:09.818 --> 10:13.777
I'm sure he must be awesome,
despite how he looks.

10:13.863 --> 10:17.026
G-Good day. lam Son Goku.

10:17.117 --> 10:20.325
l kindly ask for your training.

10:20.412 --> 10:24.121
Kaio-sama, teach me your martial arts, okay?

10:24.207 --> 10:26.163
I mean, please?

10:32.132 --> 10:35.499
l-ls that training?

10:35.593 --> 10:38.460
You want me to move like that?

10:40.098 --> 10:46.435
Kaio-sama, w-what's the
matter with the ground here?

10:50.400 --> 10:53.938
Say, what are you doing there?

11:07.542 --> 11:09.908
How about this heat?

11:28.980 --> 11:33.724
What are you doing there?

11:33.818 --> 11:37.652
Huh? W-Who are you?

11:37.739 --> 11:39.320
Who, me?

11:39.407 --> 11:41.568
lam...

11:41.659 --> 11:42.990
...scratch, scratch, scratch...

11:43.078 --> 11:50.120
Oh, kayui, oh, kay'i, oh, ka'i,
oh, kai, oh... [kayui: "itchy"]

11:50.210 --> 11:51.916
Kaio!

11:55.256 --> 11:56.416
Then, who's that?

11:56.508 --> 11:59.625
That is my pet, Bubbles-kun.

12:01.513 --> 12:06.507
O-Ohh! And here, I thought it was strange.

12:06.601 --> 12:09.138
You're the strange one.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.845
By the way...

12:11.940 --> 12:15.103
That pun there was the best, don't you think?

12:15.193 --> 12:18.435
You may feel free to laugh at it.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.111
At what?

12:22.575 --> 12:26.363
You must have been too tense to hear it.

12:26.454 --> 12:29.912
What am | to do with you, honestly?

12:29.999 --> 12:33.992
Well, I'll hit you with
another pun, no extra charge.

12:38.550 --> 12:41.337
Hello? Hello?

12:41.428 --> 12:45.797
Huh? Nobody's answering [" den wa"]
on the phone ["denwa"].

12:51.604 --> 12:53.060
That's great!

12:53.148 --> 12:54.604
What is?

12:58.611 --> 13:02.445
What have you come here for?

13:02.532 --> 13:06.992
H was hoping to have
you train me, Kaio-sama.

13:07.078 --> 13:09.285
Train you?

13:18.047 --> 13:20.379
What is that?! You call that defending?!

13:32.604 --> 13:38.270
You've got to focus your Ki more!
I'm just itching to kill you!

13:40.069 --> 13:44.278
Training, huh? I'd be willing to do that.

13:44.365 --> 13:45.775
ReaHy?!

13:45.867 --> 13:47.198
However...

13:47.285 --> 13:49.901
...you have to pass my test first.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.531
I'll do it once you can make me,
Kaio-sama, the wizard of gags,

13:54.626 --> 13:57.493
laugh at one of your gags.

13:57.587 --> 14:01.421
Eh?! Me, make a pun?!

14:01.508 --> 14:03.373
Losing your nerve, are you?

14:03.468 --> 14:08.462
It has to be a pretty high-level pun,
or I won't laugh at it.

14:08.556 --> 14:10.638
Well, how about it?

14:14.229 --> 14:16.390
It looks like this might be too much for you.

14:16.481 --> 14:19.063
In that case, give up and go home!

14:19.150 --> 14:21.732
M-My futon...

14:21.819 --> 14:23.980
...flew away ["futtonda"]!

14:26.741 --> 14:30.404
Y-Your futon... flew away...

14:33.706 --> 14:35.037
Oh, almost there!

14:35.124 --> 14:38.708
My cat ["neko"] lay down ["nekoronda"]!

14:42.048 --> 14:44.664
Pencils ["enpitsu"] can't see ["mien pitsu"]!

14:49.847 --> 14:54.841
Ah! You laughed! Kaio-sama, you laughed!

14:56.604 --> 14:58.845
The flounder ["hirame"]
had an epiphany ["hirameita"]!

15:06.281 --> 15:09.944
You're no slouch at this,
are you? I'll bet you're a pro!

15:10.034 --> 15:12.616
Very well, I shall train you.

15:12.704 --> 15:14.740
I'm going to tell you...

15:14.831 --> 15:17.163
...my greatest gag!

15:18.960 --> 15:22.794
N-Never mind the gags,
teach me some martial arts.

15:22.880 --> 15:27.499
Oh, martial arts? Why didn't
you say so in the first place?

15:27.594 --> 15:29.755
All right, try coming at me!

15:29.846 --> 15:33.088
I'm going to see just how good you are.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.892
What's wrong?

15:37.979 --> 15:40.095
That's just it, there's something
that ain't right here.

15:40.189 --> 15:44.478
My body feels so heavy, it's hard to move.

15:44.569 --> 15:47.060
Where did you come from? Earth?

15:47.155 --> 15:48.565
Mm-hmm.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.817
Then it would be heavy for you, huh?

15:50.908 --> 15:54.071
This is a small planet, but it has
tremendous gravity, you see?

15:54.162 --> 15:57.780
I'd say it's about ten times
what you have on your planet.

15:57.874 --> 16:01.207
So your body weighs ten times as much, too.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.129
Tryjumping for me. As high as you can.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.796
O-Okay.

16:13.306 --> 16:16.969
l-lt's no use. I can only
go up that short distance.

16:18.936 --> 16:22.520
To be able to jump that high
in ten times his own gravity...

16:22.607 --> 16:25.690
This guy has a lot of promise.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.861
Well then, I'm going to start your training.

17:15.952 --> 17:18.614
How long do you plan on staying?

17:20.790 --> 17:25.784
I don't know how many days I've been
running down the Serpentine Road,

17:25.877 --> 17:27.993
but I don't think I've got that much time.

17:28.089 --> 17:31.297
You see, these Saiyan guys
are coming to our planet

17:31.384 --> 17:33.625
to do some awful things.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.427
So until they do, however short that time is,

17:36.514 --> 17:38.630
I'd like for you to train me.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.261
The Saiyans, huh?

17:40.351 --> 17:44.094
You've drawn the attention of
some formidable folks, all right.

17:44.188 --> 17:45.849
Let's see...

17:47.150 --> 17:51.689
Let me check to see when the
Saiyans will arrive on Earth.

18:02.665 --> 18:05.782
Those are Saiyans flying there, all right.

18:08.421 --> 18:11.128
They'll arrive at Earth in, let's see,

18:11.215 --> 18:15.629
I'd say 158 days.

18:15.720 --> 18:19.212
Awesome! You can tell that much?

18:19.307 --> 18:24.722
These handy antennae are nice
and steady ["antei na"]. Get it?

18:24.812 --> 18:27.224
That was great!

18:33.362 --> 18:36.490
Maybe I won't train you after all.

18:37.617 --> 18:40.233
That was great! That was great! That was great!

18:40.328 --> 18:41.408
Wasn't it?

18:41.496 --> 18:46.616
But, I ain't got but 158 days
until the Saiyans arrive?

18:46.709 --> 18:51.373
Hey, 158 days will be plenty.

18:51.464 --> 18:54.831
If I train you on this planet for 158 days,

18:54.926 --> 18:57.383
it will have the same value
as training back on Earth

18:57.470 --> 18:59.256
for thousands of years.

18:59.347 --> 19:01.838
--Really?!
--However...

19:01.933 --> 19:05.801
...even if you do train, you won't
necessarily beat the Saiyans.

19:05.895 --> 19:12.391
That's how terribly strong the
two Saiyans headed to Earth are.

19:12.485 --> 19:17.445
Frankly, their strength is
even greater than mine.

19:17.532 --> 19:19.147
Greater than yours, Kaio-sama?!

19:19.242 --> 19:21.198
That's right.

19:21.285 --> 19:24.322
Which means that if you
can't at least surpass me,

19:24.413 --> 19:28.076
it will be impossible for
you to beat the Saiyans.

19:31.629 --> 19:35.213
Well, we should get started right away.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.915
Hey, Bubbles-kun!

19:46.102 --> 19:50.721
First, you have to overcome
the severe gravity here.

19:50.815 --> 19:53.272
Try to catch Bubbles-kun here.

19:53.359 --> 19:58.820
If you can't at least move
that fast, you'll get nowhere.

20:01.284 --> 20:03.491
A-All right.

20:03.578 --> 20:06.160
Okay, run away, Bubbles-kun!

20:09.625 --> 20:11.161
Hold it!

20:20.970 --> 20:26.260
D-Damn it! My body really does feel heavy!

20:26.350 --> 20:29.137
Damn!

20:29.228 --> 20:31.093
All right...

20:31.188 --> 20:33.315
Just you watch!

20:45.870 --> 20:48.953
I'm gonna catch you!

20:49.040 --> 20:53.784
Oh, he's already wearing
super-weighted gear, is he?

20:57.340 --> 21:00.377
This makes me quite a bit lighter!

21:04.722 --> 21:09.716
Goku's arduous training has finally begun!

21:09.810 --> 21:14.179
Will he be able to conquer
the gravity on Kaio's World,

21:14.273 --> 21:19.063
which is ten times greater than Earth's?

21:19.153 --> 21:25.774
158 days remain until the Saiyans reach Earth!

21:25.868 --> 21:29.360
The trials have just begun!

21:31.832 --> 21:34.744
Yaburekabure omoikiri

21:47.807 --> 21:51.140
Let's go tip-top! All right?

21:51.227 --> 21:57.018
Me mo sameru you na aoi chikyuu

21:57.108 --> 22:03.195

22:35.855 --> 22:37.811
I'm gonna catch you for sure, Bubbles!

22:37.898 --> 22:41.857
Be sure to eat plenty ["tappuri(n)"] of
pudding ["purin"] during your training.

22:41.944 --> 22:44.401
I am a master at these!

22:44.488 --> 22:48.322
Maybe I won't train you after all.

22:48.409 --> 22:50.445
That was great, that was great!

22:50.536 --> 22:52.447
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:52.538 --> 22:56.372
"The Battle With 10-Times Gravity!
Goku, Your Training is a Race. "

22:56.459 --> 22:59.951
I wonder if Father is really training.
