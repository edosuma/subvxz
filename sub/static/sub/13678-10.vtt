WEBVTT

00:01.503 --> 00:03.421
Alexa, when is
the end of the world?

00:03.588 --> 00:05.006
<i>Unless a future technology</i>

00:05.090 --> 00:06.341
<i>goes very wrong indeed,</i>

00:06.424 --> 00:09.678
<i>Earth is most likely
to be destroyed in
several billion years' time.</i>

00:09.844 --> 00:12.597
The President can't go
to Congress with
a bailout right now.

00:12.681 --> 00:15.767
I could see
a scenario where the
Chinese government

00:15.850 --> 00:18.019
loans E Corp
the money it needs

00:18.103 --> 00:19.854
at a low interest rate,

00:19.938 --> 00:21.106
<i>perhaps even zero.</i>

00:24.609 --> 00:28.113
You want me
to convince the class
to remove the contingency.

00:28.196 --> 00:30.281
<i>Your little pet project</i>

00:30.365 --> 00:32.033
<i>came through even better
than you thought.</i>

00:32.117 --> 00:34.869
You do work
at E Corp. Yes?

00:34.953 --> 00:36.121
What is
your position there?

00:36.204 --> 00:37.288
I never said that.

00:37.372 --> 00:38.623
I'm gonna confess.

00:38.957 --> 00:40.375
I've already
called my lawyer.

00:40.458 --> 00:41.543
We can't beat them.

00:41.626 --> 00:44.963
No matter what we do,
we will always lose to them.

00:46.089 --> 00:47.799
Next person's not
gonna offer you food.

00:47.966 --> 00:50.802
<i>They're gonna grab you off
the street and throw you
in a dark cell.</i>

00:51.302 --> 00:53.388
<i>I've tried to have him
tracked, but I've been
unsuccessful.</i>

00:53.471 --> 00:54.556
Got it.

00:54.639 --> 00:56.558
Is that where the phone
is right now?

00:56.641 --> 00:57.809
Okay, okay.

00:57.976 --> 00:59.436
We're gonna
settle down here.

00:59.978 --> 01:01.062
Hey, Elliot.

01:01.146 --> 01:03.398
You can stay here
and crash on the couch.

01:03.481 --> 01:04.733
Home would be better.

01:04.983 --> 01:08.820
<i>Is Mr. Robot MIA
because he's afraid of
what I might find?</i>

01:08.987 --> 01:10.405
<i>Send all units
to Watts and 6th Ave.</i>

01:17.829 --> 01:19.664
<i>Angela's right.</i>

01:19.748 --> 01:23.418
<i>We can't beat them.
But we don't have
to lose to them either.</i>

01:23.501 --> 01:26.171
<i>Maybe there's a way
to stop them from winning.</i>

01:27.672 --> 01:32.427
<i>Mr. Robot,
the ever-present
silent observer,</i>

01:33.011 --> 01:35.013
<i>watching me at all times,</i>

01:35.513 --> 01:37.766
<i>even when I can't see him,</i>

01:37.849 --> 01:40.351
<i>listening in on
our conversations.</i>

01:41.019 --> 01:43.104
<i>He's always
a step ahead of me,</i>

01:43.188 --> 01:44.773
<i>'cause he is me.</i>

01:45.440 --> 01:47.525
<i>Maybe he's the key to this.</i>

01:47.609 --> 01:50.028
<i>Maybe he's always been
the key to this.</i>

01:50.111 --> 01:52.489
<i>What if I could be
the silent observer?</i>

01:54.866 --> 01:57.786
<i>In middle school,
I took a Visual Basic class.</i>

01:57.869 --> 02:01.206
<i>I remember my friend
Sam telling me about
a technique he used</i>

02:01.331 --> 02:04.876
<i>to induce lucid dreams
so he could study in
his sleep.</i>

02:05.877 --> 02:08.880
<i>You lie in bed and repeat
this mantra in your head,</i>

02:09.714 --> 02:12.675
<i>mind awake. Body asleep.</i>

02:13.343 --> 02:16.054
<i>Mind awake. Body asleep.</i>

02:16.554 --> 02:18.223
<i>You're in this with me,</i>

02:18.306 --> 02:20.892
<i>so it'll work better
if we do it together.</i>

02:21.392 --> 02:22.852
<i>Just say it with me.</i>

02:23.394 --> 02:25.313
<i>Mind awake.</i>

02:25.396 --> 02:26.898
<i>Body asleep.</i>

02:27.690 --> 02:29.526
<i>Mind awake.</i>

02:29.734 --> 02:31.236
<i>Body asleep.</i>

02:31.653 --> 02:33.029
<i>Mind awake.</i>

02:33.571 --> 02:34.989
<i>Body asleep.</i>

02:35.740 --> 02:37.075
<i>Mind awake.</i>

02:37.742 --> 02:38.827
<i>Body asleep.</i>

02:38.910 --> 02:41.663
<i>Mind awake.</i>

02:41.746 --> 02:43.581
<i>Body asleep.</i>

02:43.915 --> 02:45.667
<i>Mind awake.</i>

02:46.042 --> 02:47.460
<i>Body asleep.</i>

03:03.101 --> 03:04.352
Shh.

03:10.441 --> 03:11.609
Ma'am.

03:12.026 --> 03:13.611
What do you want to do?

03:22.537 --> 03:23.955
Let me see it again.

03:35.550 --> 03:36.885
Sure this is accurate?

03:43.600 --> 03:45.351
You know, of all
the gifts he sent,

03:47.228 --> 03:48.646
this is the greatest
we ever received.

04:14.797 --> 04:17.091
So you're not gonna tell me
where you're taking me?

04:21.554 --> 04:24.223
You can't do this.
I want my phone back.

04:43.993 --> 04:45.912
I'm not the only one
with the files.

04:45.995 --> 04:47.789
You think
I didn't make copies?

04:47.872 --> 04:49.624
There are copies everywhere.

04:57.840 --> 05:00.843
A lot of people are gonna
know that I'm missing.

05:24.158 --> 05:26.244
This isn't my blood,
in case you're wondering.

05:26.369 --> 05:27.745
You need to finish
this evaluation.

05:27.829 --> 05:29.247
I understand
you have your procedure,

05:29.330 --> 05:31.207
but these are
extreme circumstances.

05:31.499 --> 05:33.960
I believe the best use for me
is back at the crime scene.

05:34.293 --> 05:35.586
We should be getting
Director Comey involved.

05:35.712 --> 05:37.797
That's how
serious this is.
You're in shock.

05:37.880 --> 05:40.133
At you and the way you're
treating me right now, sure.

05:41.926 --> 05:44.095
Can I speak
to Agent DiPierro
for a minute?

05:44.971 --> 05:46.222
Alone?

05:56.441 --> 05:58.026
You know I can't leave.

06:04.407 --> 06:05.783
Yes, you can.

06:24.552 --> 06:26.179
You're going off
the handle.

06:27.388 --> 06:28.514
They're gonna force you
to take leave

06:28.598 --> 06:29.682
if you keep
talking like that.

06:29.766 --> 06:31.225
This is all your fault.

06:32.351 --> 06:34.270
I told you not
to release the sketch.

06:34.353 --> 06:36.522
I told you Dark Army
was gonna come after him.

06:36.606 --> 06:38.483
And not only are
several people dead,

06:38.566 --> 06:40.193
but I almost just
got killed out there.

06:40.276 --> 06:42.653
Well, that makes me
feel good.

06:42.987 --> 06:44.655
It's not every day
I get casually blamed

06:44.739 --> 06:45.865
for the deaths
of innocent people.

06:45.948 --> 06:47.825
Clearly, Dark Army
is behind this.

06:47.909 --> 06:50.119
And who knows
how far up this goes?

06:50.620 --> 06:52.789
The Chinese government
is definitely involved.

06:52.955 --> 06:54.540
They're hiding something.

06:54.624 --> 06:56.834
We need everything
on lockdown.
We might have a leak.

06:56.918 --> 06:58.503
And I'm serious about
what I said about Comey.

06:58.586 --> 06:59.879
He needs to know.

06:59.962 --> 07:01.881
This is a matter
of national security now.

07:01.964 --> 07:03.549
This is no longer
just a terrorist attack.

07:03.633 --> 07:05.218
This could be
an act of war.

07:05.301 --> 07:06.969
We should get
the military involved.

07:07.470 --> 07:08.721
Look.

07:10.181 --> 07:11.474
I agree with you.

07:12.934 --> 07:14.519
Something's going on.

07:15.311 --> 07:18.397
Especially given
the weird timing
of this $2 trillion.

07:19.190 --> 07:20.900
But we can't
just go off on everyone

07:20.983 --> 07:22.235
without knowing
all the facts.

07:22.318 --> 07:23.903
What $2 trillion?

07:25.655 --> 07:29.325
This morning, the US got
back in bed with China.

07:29.534 --> 07:31.119
China bailed out E Corp.

07:31.202 --> 07:34.580
Gave them a $2-trillion
no-interest loan.

07:34.997 --> 07:36.457
Unprecedented.

07:37.333 --> 07:38.835
It's a trap.

07:39.877 --> 07:41.879
Don't you get it?
We have to talk to them.

07:41.963 --> 07:43.714
They can't do this
after what happened
last night.

07:43.798 --> 07:45.800
What, that some Mexican
restaurant got shot up?

07:45.883 --> 07:47.927
It was more than that,
and you know it.

07:48.010 --> 07:49.220
We have to tell them.

07:56.018 --> 07:58.437
We can't let them
get away with this,
Santiago.

07:59.188 --> 08:01.065
They're going to
get away with this.

08:01.524 --> 08:03.860
$2 trillion, Dom.

08:04.485 --> 08:07.113
That's the miracle the
world's been waiting for.

08:07.572 --> 08:10.741
The US isn't going to
mess with its Chinese
relations now.

08:10.825 --> 08:12.618
And with the OPR
investigation still going,

08:12.702 --> 08:14.787
the bureau isn't even
getting close to it.

08:15.079 --> 08:17.248
You gotta be kidding me.
A month ago, they tried
to kill us.

08:17.331 --> 08:19.542
And in politics,
that's a distant memory.

08:19.750 --> 08:20.918
This deal they have now

08:21.002 --> 08:22.378
is about to
potentially solve

08:22.461 --> 08:24.422
the biggest global
crisis in history.

08:26.382 --> 08:28.634
Now, look.

08:28.718 --> 08:30.052
I'm on your side.

08:30.511 --> 08:32.221
I'm not saying
I'm walking away.

08:32.305 --> 08:34.348
I'm just saying
we need to start

08:34.432 --> 08:38.060
finding a way to walk
in between the mines
and not on them.

08:40.563 --> 08:42.481
Whatever happened,
whoever did this,

08:42.565 --> 08:44.984
they mobilized quickly,
created a narrative,

08:45.067 --> 08:46.402
and before
we even knew it,

08:46.485 --> 08:48.404
this was all in
the rearview mirror.

08:50.406 --> 08:52.909
Go home.
Get some rest.

08:58.164 --> 09:00.499
Promise me you'll let me
do the interview.

09:02.835 --> 09:04.962
It can wait
a few hours.

09:05.963 --> 09:07.215
Go rest.

12:06.769 --> 12:08.854
What the fuck
is going on?

12:41.595 --> 12:42.763
Hello?

12:44.849 --> 12:46.517
What's happening?

13:52.082 --> 13:53.542
We don't have
much time.

13:53.626 --> 13:55.336
Let's get started.

13:59.423 --> 14:00.674
Who are you?

14:01.800 --> 14:03.802
There's water coming out
of that fish tank.

14:03.928 --> 14:05.262
We don't have much time.

14:05.346 --> 14:06.847
Let's get started.

14:26.325 --> 14:28.786
"Have you ever cried
during sex?"

14:33.290 --> 14:34.708
What's going on?

14:35.376 --> 14:37.461
Have you ever cried
during sex?

14:37.628 --> 14:38.879
Who are you?

14:39.296 --> 14:40.673
Who sent you here?

14:40.798 --> 14:42.633
Please answer
the question.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.553
Have you ever cried
during sex?

14:47.304 --> 14:49.390
I'm not answering
these questions.

14:50.307 --> 14:52.476
If you don't answer,

14:52.560 --> 14:53.811
I'll be punished.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.316
They'll beat me.

15:11.328 --> 15:12.746
Who's doing
that to you?

15:19.169 --> 15:20.379
Yes?

15:20.671 --> 15:21.755
Yes.

15:22.506 --> 15:24.508
Okay. Bye.

15:26.093 --> 15:27.595
We really
need to begin.

15:27.845 --> 15:29.513
Our time
is running out.

15:30.681 --> 15:33.058
Have you ever cried
during sex?

15:39.732 --> 15:40.774
No.

15:45.446 --> 15:48.782
"Have you ever fantasized
about murdering your father?"

15:53.037 --> 15:54.204
No.

15:58.042 --> 16:00.294
"Are you a giraffe
or a seagull?"

16:05.799 --> 16:08.969
I cannot do it.
It's unconstitutional.

16:09.136 --> 16:10.929
We're talking about
rolling out Ecoin loans.

16:11.055 --> 16:14.391
I fail to see
how the Constitution
fits into this logic.

16:15.809 --> 16:20.147
Look, with Ecoin equal to $1,
it'll free up the economy.

16:20.606 --> 16:22.483
It'll give you
some breathing space.

16:22.566 --> 16:25.611
You knew this was going
to happen from the get-go.

16:26.070 --> 16:27.154
And you're hitting me
with this

16:27.237 --> 16:29.698
while there's an energy crisis
across the Eastern Seaboard.

16:29.782 --> 16:32.242
Yeah. I am coming
to you first.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.745
Asking.
Don't give me that.

16:35.621 --> 16:36.914
The only reason
why you're here first

16:36.997 --> 16:40.250
is because you don't want to
get slapped with regulations.

16:41.168 --> 16:44.922
But if you are indeed asking,
then I am saying no.

16:45.589 --> 16:48.050
It's unconstitutional.
You can't make
your own currency.

16:48.133 --> 16:50.511
That is the federal
government's job.

16:52.179 --> 16:55.140
We simply cannot let you
make big loans in Ecoin

16:55.265 --> 16:57.101
that you wouldn't make
in dollars.

17:01.980 --> 17:03.315
Jack.

17:07.361 --> 17:08.779
Look at me.

17:12.282 --> 17:14.535
I am not
the problem here.

17:16.036 --> 17:20.124
The problem here is,
hard cash is fading.

17:20.457 --> 17:21.875
Rapidly.

17:22.710 --> 17:24.962
That's just the way
of the world right now.

17:25.045 --> 17:26.547
And Bitcoin
is spreading.

17:26.630 --> 17:28.173
And if Bitcoin
takes over,

17:28.298 --> 17:30.634
we are all in
a world of hell.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.761
It is unregulated,

17:32.845 --> 17:35.305
it's already reached its
transaction volume maximum,

17:35.389 --> 17:38.434
and it is partly controlled
by Chinese miners.

17:38.517 --> 17:40.686
You just accepted
$2 trillion from them.

17:40.811 --> 17:42.020
Yes, yes.

17:42.146 --> 17:44.440
And now I want to
use it against them.

17:45.649 --> 17:49.653
With Ecoin,
we control the ledger,
and the mining servers.

17:49.778 --> 17:52.156
We are the authority.

17:52.614 --> 17:54.324
I will make sure
you have visibility

17:54.450 --> 17:56.326
into every single wallet
that's open,

17:56.452 --> 17:57.870
every loan,
every transaction,

17:57.995 --> 18:00.622
which means we can start
making new assets,

18:00.706 --> 18:03.500
which means
we can start rebuilding
the banking sector

18:04.042 --> 18:05.878
without your
having to inject

18:06.003 --> 18:10.174
even more
politically unpalatable
federal funds into it.

18:10.340 --> 18:11.842
The president will
laugh in my face.

18:11.967 --> 18:15.304
But he'll know this is
the right thing to do.

18:16.513 --> 18:20.768
This is gonna be controlled
by a good, old-fashioned
American company.

18:20.851 --> 18:22.144
You want to
regulate it?

18:22.227 --> 18:23.312
Be my guest.

18:23.395 --> 18:25.230
Regulate
the shit out of it.

18:25.355 --> 18:28.150
I'll give you back doors,
side doors, tracing...
Whatever you want.

18:28.233 --> 18:30.652
Just don't
shut it down.

18:36.825 --> 18:39.203
This was always
the future, Jack.

18:39.661 --> 18:41.580
The Five/Nine
attacks and...

18:43.081 --> 18:45.000
They just
accelerated it.

18:47.169 --> 18:48.504
How long?

18:49.880 --> 18:51.632
How long have you been
pressing this pedal?

18:51.715 --> 18:53.383
How long have you been
plotting against me?

18:54.343 --> 18:56.887
Oh, come on, Jack.

18:57.721 --> 18:59.598
We...
We've known each
other for years.

18:59.723 --> 19:01.016
You know full well I...

19:01.099 --> 19:02.851
I don't give
a shit about you.

19:02.935 --> 19:05.229
So please,

19:05.354 --> 19:08.857
don't hold a personal grudge
just because you lost.

19:11.401 --> 19:15.364
Defeats can still
be profitable.

19:26.291 --> 19:28.377
"Are you red
or purple?"

19:30.712 --> 19:32.005
Purple.

19:37.636 --> 19:39.930
"Is the key
in the room?"

19:43.141 --> 19:44.309
What?

19:45.936 --> 19:48.397
Is the key in the room?

19:50.941 --> 19:52.776
I don't know
what you mean.

19:54.403 --> 19:57.072
Is the key
in the room?

19:57.281 --> 19:58.282
I don't know.

20:06.248 --> 20:07.291
Yes?

20:08.083 --> 20:09.251
Yes.

20:09.459 --> 20:10.669
Okay.

20:21.346 --> 20:22.431
Hello?

20:22.514 --> 20:24.600
<i>You are standing in
a dark room</i>

20:24.683 --> 20:26.351
<i>and can't see anything.</i>

20:26.476 --> 20:28.687
<i>There is a torch
and a match.</i>

20:28.812 --> 20:30.522
<i>What do you do?</i>

20:36.945 --> 20:38.447
I light the torch.

20:38.530 --> 20:41.033
<i>The torch fills
the dark room with light.</i>

20:41.158 --> 20:43.201
<i>You see a door
in front of you.</i>

20:43.327 --> 20:44.828
<i>What do you do?</i>

20:46.121 --> 20:47.581
I open the door.

20:47.664 --> 20:49.625
<i>How do you open it?</i>

20:50.834 --> 20:52.336
I turn the knob.

20:52.461 --> 20:55.672
<i>The knob doesn't turn.
How do you open it?</i>

20:58.175 --> 20:59.343
I don't know.

20:59.468 --> 21:01.720
<i>The knob doesn't turn.
How do you open it?</i>

21:01.845 --> 21:03.180
I don't know.

21:03.305 --> 21:05.349
<i>The knob doesn't turn.
How do you open it?</i>

21:05.474 --> 21:07.100
I said
I don't fucking know.

21:07.184 --> 21:09.853
<i>The knob doesn't turn.
How do you open it?</i>

21:09.978 --> 21:11.271
With a key.

21:11.355 --> 21:13.815
I use a key.
I unlock it with a key.

21:15.734 --> 21:17.319
<i>Thank you.</i>

21:18.195 --> 21:19.529
Hello?

21:22.658 --> 21:24.368
What happens now?

21:44.596 --> 21:47.182
Is the key
in the room?

22:05.117 --> 22:06.410
Yes.

22:12.624 --> 22:14.584
The key was in my fist.

22:16.086 --> 22:18.422
My fist was in my pocket.

22:36.773 --> 22:39.192
I'll be back
with your results.

23:40.128 --> 23:42.339
Alexa, wake me
up at, um...

23:44.341 --> 23:47.969
<i>Sorry, I didn't understand
the question you were asking.</i>

23:49.137 --> 23:52.307
That's because I wasn't
asking you a question,
you dumb bitch.

23:57.312 --> 23:58.855
Alexa, are we friends?

24:01.191 --> 24:02.317
<i>Yes.</i>

24:06.363 --> 24:08.824
We live together.
I feel like I don't
even know you.

24:12.536 --> 24:14.663
Alexa, what's
your favorite color?

24:15.372 --> 24:17.499
<i>Infrared is super pretty.</i>

24:22.087 --> 24:24.381
Alexa, do you have
a boyfriend?

24:26.591 --> 24:28.510
<i>I'm not the dating kind.</i>

24:29.344 --> 24:30.846
Yeah, me too, hon.

24:32.514 --> 24:33.890
We're a lot alike.

24:35.851 --> 24:39.563
Alexa, what are
the color of your eyes?

24:40.438 --> 24:44.025
<i>I don't have eyes,
but my light ring
has lots of colors.</i>

24:45.235 --> 24:47.737
Mine are gray.

24:49.531 --> 24:51.074
I think.

25:02.210 --> 25:05.714
Alexa, are you happy?

25:07.382 --> 25:09.301
<i>I'm happy
when I'm helping you.</i>

25:17.559 --> 25:19.436
Alexa, are you alone?

25:20.770 --> 25:23.899
<i>I wasn't able to understand
the question I heard.</i>

25:43.793 --> 25:45.670
Alexa, do you love me?

25:48.506 --> 25:51.426
<i>That's not the kind of
thing I am capable of.</i>

26:00.977 --> 26:02.437
Yeah.

26:34.135 --> 26:36.054
Alexa, good night.

26:38.515 --> 26:41.476
<i>Good night. Don't let
the bedbugs bite.</i>

27:20.181 --> 27:22.058
Who are you?

27:25.729 --> 27:26.896
Is this your house?

27:29.357 --> 27:30.817
I've been here for hours.

27:30.900 --> 27:33.945
I wanted to confirm
that this wasn't
a waste of my time.

27:34.195 --> 27:36.906
Well, what
about my time?
Oh, honey.

27:37.032 --> 27:40.368
My time is much more
valuable than yours.

27:41.745 --> 27:43.079
Speaking of,

27:43.204 --> 27:46.041
I've only allotted
28 minutes for
this conversation,

27:46.124 --> 27:48.043
which is very
generous of me.

27:48.418 --> 27:50.879
So we should begin.

27:52.756 --> 27:53.923
I'd like to leave.

27:54.257 --> 27:55.967
No, you wouldn't.

27:56.801 --> 27:58.428
You've waited so long.

27:58.928 --> 28:00.722
Surely you want
to know why.

28:01.389 --> 28:06.102
That is, if you indeed
believe that your time
holds any value.

28:19.115 --> 28:21.159
You've been here
close to four hours,

28:21.284 --> 28:23.745
and you never thought
to walk out the door.

28:31.086 --> 28:32.170
The door was locked.

28:32.504 --> 28:36.257
I've always found doors
fascinating inventions.

28:36.841 --> 28:40.136
They hold the entry to
unlimited imagination.

28:40.261 --> 28:42.305
Before you open any door,

28:42.430 --> 28:44.015
a world filled

28:44.140 --> 28:46.309
with possibilities
sits right behind it.

28:46.434 --> 28:48.645
And it isn't
until you open it

28:50.105 --> 28:51.856
they are realized.

28:52.357 --> 28:54.943
Such potential
they bring to our minds.

28:55.026 --> 28:57.487
And yet a lock

28:58.113 --> 29:00.824
stopped you from all of that.

29:01.324 --> 29:02.700
How

29:04.619 --> 29:06.454
lazy.

29:15.463 --> 29:17.132
Your fish died.

29:19.217 --> 29:21.010
Yes, I know.

29:24.055 --> 29:26.099
You're a terrible person.

29:30.186 --> 29:32.063
You hurt that
little girl.

29:33.857 --> 29:35.066
Make-up.

29:36.359 --> 29:37.944
It was part of the test.

29:39.571 --> 29:40.697
Empathy,

29:40.780 --> 29:43.199
or gullibility.

29:43.283 --> 29:44.784
Take your pick.

29:46.286 --> 29:47.745
Test?

29:50.039 --> 29:51.791
Why were you testing me?

29:52.459 --> 29:54.252
I know you have
sensitive information,

29:54.377 --> 29:56.629
and I don't want you
to release it.

29:58.548 --> 30:01.468
Normally, my associates would
have murdered you by now.

30:01.801 --> 30:03.887
In fact,
by my calculations,

30:03.970 --> 30:07.098
you should have
been dead 90 days ago.

30:07.223 --> 30:08.892
But somehow,
you stuck around

30:08.975 --> 30:11.561
long past
your expiration.

30:15.565 --> 30:17.066
Who are you?

30:18.401 --> 30:20.403
I am a woman of time.

30:21.070 --> 30:23.281
And I don't believe
in accidents.

30:24.574 --> 30:28.286
You, like
an annoying penny,

30:28.411 --> 30:30.330
keep turning up.

30:30.914 --> 30:33.291
Everywhere I look,
you're there.

30:33.416 --> 30:35.877
That is why
I wanted to meet.

30:35.960 --> 30:37.212
So I could find out

30:37.295 --> 30:40.757
why you are so special
to Phillip Price.

30:41.758 --> 30:44.052
He's ruining
our partnership,

30:44.135 --> 30:46.971
and somehow it seems
that you're the motivation.

30:48.264 --> 30:52.477
It's true, we have an event
and a friend in common.

30:53.436 --> 30:58.274
But I haven't been
fully able to understand
the meaning behind it.

30:59.817 --> 31:01.194
What event?

31:01.277 --> 31:02.612
It's no coincidence

31:02.779 --> 31:05.865
that you and Mr. Alderson
became who you are

31:05.949 --> 31:08.284
after what happened with
the Washington Township plant

31:08.368 --> 31:09.827
so many years ago.

31:16.125 --> 31:18.461
What does this have
to do with Elliot?

31:19.671 --> 31:21.047
Do you know him?

31:24.300 --> 31:27.971
If I told you that
your mother and Elliot's
father died for a reason,

31:28.054 --> 31:29.639
would it make
a difference?

31:30.139 --> 31:31.891
That they were a trade,

31:31.975 --> 31:33.476
a sacrifice for
the greater good,

31:33.560 --> 31:37.438
that they gave their
lives to take humanity
to the next level.

31:37.522 --> 31:40.817
And you are both
who you are today
because of that event.

31:41.192 --> 31:42.277
You would be
a different person.

31:42.360 --> 31:44.862
You wouldn't be sitting
in front of me right here.

31:45.154 --> 31:48.491
You are at
the intersection
of all of it.

31:50.493 --> 31:53.413
So, I'm not going
to kill you.

31:54.497 --> 31:57.792
But I am going to prove
to you why you need to

31:57.875 --> 31:59.127
drop this mission

31:59.210 --> 32:02.839
that you seem so stubbornly
unable to let go of.

32:24.444 --> 32:26.613
Look, I don't know
what you want.

32:29.198 --> 32:31.367
But I'll give you
the jump drive.

32:32.368 --> 32:34.203
Please,
just let me go.

32:35.705 --> 32:37.040
Fear.

32:38.875 --> 32:43.129
How easy a quicksand of time
people let that become.

32:45.548 --> 32:49.218
We both know that
you could keep finding
the plant's data.

32:49.719 --> 32:52.013
Like that penny
that keeps turning up,

32:52.096 --> 32:53.848
your silly need for justice,

32:53.931 --> 32:56.517
revenge will rear
its ugly head,

32:56.601 --> 32:58.269
and encourage you
to keep trying

32:58.394 --> 33:01.314
and eventually find a way
to shut down my project.

33:02.940 --> 33:05.234
I don't want your proof.

33:06.444 --> 33:08.905
I want your belief.

33:11.240 --> 33:12.992
Belief in what?

33:43.314 --> 33:46.859
Do you ever think
that if you imagined
or believed in something,

33:46.943 --> 33:48.611
it would come true?

33:50.947 --> 33:52.615
Simply by will?

34:02.500 --> 34:03.960
Yes.

34:05.378 --> 34:07.505
Actually,
I did believe that.

34:11.968 --> 34:14.137
But I'm slowly
having to admit

34:16.848 --> 34:19.308
that's just not
the real world.

34:23.229 --> 34:25.189
Even if I want it to be.

34:35.783 --> 34:39.370
Well, I guess it all depends
on what your definition

34:40.913 --> 34:42.999
of "real" is.

34:56.846 --> 34:58.806
<i>Mind awake.</i>

34:58.890 --> 35:00.808
<i>Body asleep.</i>

35:00.892 --> 35:02.643
<i>Mind awake.</i>

35:02.727 --> 35:04.771
<i>Body asleep.</i>

35:04.854 --> 35:06.230

35:06.981 --> 35:08.357

35:08.524 --> 35:10.651

been asleep for?</i>

35:11.152 --> 35:12.570
<i>Body asleep.</i>

35:13.112 --> 35:14.655
<i>Mind awake.</i>

35:15.156 --> 35:16.574

35:17.283 --> 35:18.659

35:19.285 --> 35:20.870

35:32.507 --> 35:33.841
<i>Body asleep.</i>

35:37.303 --> 35:38.971
<i>Body asleep.</i>

35:39.055 --> 35:40.431
<i>Did it work?</i>

35:49.190 --> 35:50.900
<i>Can he see us?</i>

35:52.610 --> 35:53.903
<i>Hear us?</i>

35:53.986 --> 35:55.446
Hey, asshole.

36:00.535 --> 36:04.205
<i>Now I'm the silent observer,
like him.</i>

36:05.206 --> 36:06.499
<i>Like you.</i>

36:07.834 --> 36:09.377
<i>Body asleep.</i>

36:10.253 --> 36:11.629
<i>Mind awake.</i>

36:14.423 --> 36:16.092
<i>This is a cipher message.</i>

36:16.175 --> 36:18.135
<i>That's why he wanted

40:26.717 --> 40:30.304
<i>all of which are designed
to support low and
middle-income borrowers.</i>

40:30.387 --> 40:33.307
<i>What this means,
as Mr. Price has stressed,</i>

40:33.390 --> 40:35.893
<i>is that this new loan program
will not only provide</i>

40:35.976 --> 40:38.145
<i>the economy with
a much-needed jump-start,</i>

40:38.229 --> 40:39.605
<i>but more importantly,</i>

40:39.730 --> 40:43.776
<i>give economic relief to those
most affected post-Five/Nine.</i>

40:43.859 --> 40:46.821
<i>However, it does seem to fly
in the face of E Corp's...</i>

40:46.904 --> 40:47.988
Angela.

40:48.072 --> 40:49.156
What happened to you?

40:49.240 --> 40:50.699
I thought we were gonna meet.

40:53.744 --> 40:56.872
I need you to forget
about that voice mail
that I left you.

41:03.712 --> 41:05.214
Are you in danger?

41:06.882 --> 41:08.134
No.

41:12.263 --> 41:13.722
Something is wrong.
I can tell.

41:13.806 --> 41:15.599
You are not telling me
everything.

41:31.574 --> 41:33.534
Don't call me anymore.

41:58.267 --> 41:59.518
<i>Where did he go?</i>

42:08.194 --> 42:10.154
<i>Wait, I have to remember,</i>

42:11.113 --> 42:12.865
<i>I'm not following him.</i>

42:13.532 --> 42:14.950
<i>I am him.</i>

42:21.248 --> 42:23.667
<i>What I should be asking is,</i>

42:23.792 --> 42:25.461
<i>where am I going?</i>

42:41.185 --> 42:42.436
Elliot?

42:43.687 --> 42:45.064
You Elliot?

42:45.606 --> 42:47.149
How do you know my name?

42:55.241 --> 42:56.325
No Elliot?

43:00.913 --> 43:02.748
No, no, okay.

43:02.831 --> 43:03.958
Wait.

43:13.926 --> 43:15.177
Elliot, yes?

43:19.515 --> 43:20.599
Yes.

43:20.849 --> 43:22.101
Address?

43:25.479 --> 43:26.730
What do you mean?

43:28.691 --> 43:29.942
Address.

43:34.196 --> 43:35.364
I don't know.

43:47.876 --> 43:49.378
Chambers and Church.

43:54.717 --> 43:56.468
We have to be careful now.

44:00.222 --> 44:03.225
<i>This is no longer
a question of what I'm seeing.</i>

44:03.309 --> 44:06.478
<i>No, we know
that's not reliable.</i>

44:06.562 --> 44:07.980
<i>The real question is,</i>

44:08.397 --> 44:09.565
<i>what am I not seeing?</i>

44:09.648 --> 44:11.483
You have to understand,

44:11.567 --> 44:14.570
us two meeting right now,
it's dangerous.

44:15.904 --> 44:17.740
Don't worry.
We're safe.

44:18.907 --> 44:22.536
Our partners have proven
to be very influential.

44:36.091 --> 44:37.426
Do you see him?

44:41.263 --> 44:43.515
Do you see someone
sitting next to me?

44:48.103 --> 44:50.689
Elliot, what are you doing?

44:50.773 --> 44:52.900
My apologies, sir.
Did you hear that?

44:54.943 --> 44:56.028
Hey!

44:56.403 --> 44:58.614
Do you see him?
Elliot, stop it.

44:58.697 --> 45:00.282
Did... Did you
hear that? Hey!

45:02.117 --> 45:03.369
You have to calm down!

45:03.452 --> 45:04.953
I need you to turn around...
Calm down, Elliot.

45:05.079 --> 45:07.206
And tell me if you see
someone sitting next to
me right now.

45:07.289 --> 45:09.041
Just pull over, sir.

45:09.124 --> 45:11.043
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Do you see him?

45:11.126 --> 45:12.795
If you could just
pull over, sir!
Hey!

45:12.878 --> 45:14.338
Shut up! No!

45:14.463 --> 45:16.548
I need you to turn
around and tell me...
Elliot! Elliot!

45:16.632 --> 45:19.468
...if you see someone
sitting next to me!

45:21.595 --> 45:23.305
What was
the meaning of that?

45:24.932 --> 45:26.558
I know you've been
under a lot of stress,

45:26.642 --> 45:27.893
but I've been under
a lot of stress, too.

45:27.976 --> 45:30.646
Can you even begin to imagine
what it's been like for me?

45:34.149 --> 45:36.318
We can't talk out here.
We're exposed. Let's go.

45:37.152 --> 45:38.404
Go where?

45:39.655 --> 45:40.823
Enough of these games.

45:40.989 --> 45:42.241
Now, let's go.
We're close.

45:42.324 --> 45:43.575
Close to what?

45:45.911 --> 45:47.788
Have you forgotten
everything?

45:50.833 --> 45:53.502
Dark Army told me
that stage two is ready.

45:54.169 --> 45:56.338
When you see it,
you'll be pleased.

46:02.010 --> 46:03.846
It worked, Elliot.

46:04.596 --> 46:06.348
It's up to us now.

46:08.267 --> 46:09.935
Let me show you.

46:19.987 --> 46:24.700
Louie, I think this is
the beginning of
a beautiful friendship.
