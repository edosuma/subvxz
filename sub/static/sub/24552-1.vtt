00:29.436 --> 00:33.371
This place is perfect, upscale,
not a meat market.

00:33.373 --> 00:35.173
Full of married, successful men.

00:35.175 --> 00:38.243
You always have to go
for a married guy?

00:38.245 --> 00:42.884
If you can, because they usually
don't even report it.

00:44.751 --> 00:46.551
Don't you ever feel bad
about that?

00:46.553 --> 00:49.387
Lauren, I don't hold a gun
to their head, okay?

00:49.389 --> 00:50.889
It's their choice.

00:50.891 --> 00:53.292
They're gonna do what
they're gonna do.

00:53.294 --> 00:59.731
And if they're going to play,
they're going to pay.

00:59.733 --> 01:01.499
You really need to get rid
of this conscience...

01:01.501 --> 01:02.935
if you're going to do this.

01:02.937 --> 01:06.672
I know, I just... I have a hard
time accepting that.

01:06.674 --> 01:07.806
What?

01:07.808 --> 01:09.941
Steal from people.

01:09.943 --> 01:13.579
If you don't wanna to do this,
that's the door.

01:13.581 --> 01:15.613
I owe you too much.

01:15.615 --> 01:17.949
You don't owe me a damn thing,
okay?

01:17.951 --> 01:21.788
You're here on your own free
will or not at all.

01:22.957 --> 01:26.491
Look, when the time's right...

01:26.493 --> 01:29.728
and it's your turn, you'll do
just fine.

01:29.730 --> 01:32.330
And you'll see how sleazy
these men are...

01:32.332 --> 01:35.203
and how they get what
they deserve.

01:36.570 --> 01:38.904
And who knows, what we do
to them...

01:38.906 --> 01:43.544
sets some of them back on the
path of marital fidelity.

01:47.847 --> 01:49.448
He's interesting.

01:49.450 --> 01:52.320
Either he's new to town
or just passing through.

01:54.921 --> 01:56.955
Well, h-h-how can you tell?

01:56.957 --> 01:59.258
This place is for executive
types...

01:59.260 --> 02:00.759
and he's obviously not one.

02:00.761 --> 02:02.461
No wedding ring, either.

02:02.463 --> 02:04.929
So, uh, not what we're
looking for?

02:04.931 --> 02:07.332
Look again.

02:07.334 --> 02:10.669
Gold watch, expensive leather
jacket, Italian jeans...

02:10.670 --> 02:12.437
and maybe a hundred-dollar
haircut...

02:12.439 --> 02:14.640
and he's really happy
about something.

02:14.642 --> 02:16.641
He can't keep that silly grin
off his face.

02:16.643 --> 02:21.445
Which means... he's looking
to celebrate.

02:21.447 --> 02:23.981
Yep, he'd like some company.

02:23.983 --> 02:27.018
Oh, god.

02:27.020 --> 02:28.486
Right there.

02:28.488 --> 02:32.324
He just ordered a
twenty-year-old Scotch.

02:32.326 --> 02:34.329
That seals it.

02:38.599 --> 02:39.831
- Hey?
- What?

02:39.833 --> 02:41.399
You got protection?

02:41.401 --> 02:42.634
Always.

02:42.636 --> 02:44.503
Just please be careful.

02:44.505 --> 02:48.673
This isn't exactly the first
time I'm doing this.

02:48.675 --> 02:49.841
I'll call you.

02:49.843 --> 02:50.845
Okay.

02:54.947 --> 02:56.817
I'll have what he's having.

03:02.722 --> 03:04.522
Mm.

03:04.524 --> 03:06.391
Another one please.

03:06.393 --> 03:07.625
It's on me.

03:07.627 --> 03:09.060
That's not necessary.

03:09.062 --> 03:12.029
Well, anyone who enjoys it
as much as you do...

03:12.031 --> 03:13.498
it's my pleasure.

03:13.500 --> 03:18.403
In that case... cheers!

03:18.405 --> 03:19.641
Cheers.

03:22.508 --> 03:23.808
Bartender, another round.

03:23.810 --> 03:25.476
This one's on me.

03:25.478 --> 03:27.813
Uh, no, I got this.

03:27.815 --> 03:29.317
It's only fair.

03:31.118 --> 03:32.416
I'm Scott.

03:32.418 --> 03:34.052
Vivian.

03:34.054 --> 03:39.060
I was thinking if we could go
someplace more... quieter.

03:59.012 --> 04:00.712
I don't believe this.

04:00.714 --> 04:02.713
You've never had a one-night
stand before?

04:02.715 --> 04:06.417
Mm, not with anyone like you.

04:06.419 --> 04:09.387
Let me tell you a little secret.

04:09.389 --> 04:14.995
Now and then, every woman likes
to get a little... freaky.

04:48.628 --> 04:49.928
Hey.

04:49.930 --> 04:51.096
Hey.

04:51.098 --> 04:52.964
What are you doing?

04:52.966 --> 04:54.498
It's time for me to go.

04:54.500 --> 04:56.635
No, no, stay till morning.

04:56.637 --> 04:58.003
It's already morning.

04:58.005 --> 05:01.072
No, look, I don't want you
to go.

05:01.074 --> 05:03.774
I think you're the perfect
woman.

05:03.776 --> 05:05.911
The perfect woman is a fantasy.

05:05.913 --> 05:11.048
So in a manner of speaking,
you're right.

05:11.050 --> 05:13.919
I wish I could stay in town,
but I can't.

05:13.921 --> 05:16.087
Damn.

05:18.625 --> 05:20.724
I don't want this to end.

05:20.726 --> 05:23.561
Have you forgotten the meaning
of a one-night stand?

05:23.563 --> 05:24.830
Come with me.

05:24.832 --> 05:26.897
- What?
- I mean it.

05:26.899 --> 05:28.500
Where?

05:28.502 --> 05:32.102
Do you want to sip Mai Tais
in Tahiti, huh?

05:32.104 --> 05:33.938
Just take off with you?

05:33.940 --> 05:36.907
Forget about my job, my family,
my friends?

05:36.909 --> 05:39.243
I'll make it worth your while.
I'm serious.

05:39.245 --> 05:41.012
Yeah, right.

05:41.014 --> 05:42.981
Yeah, you're right,
I'm just being crazy.

05:42.983 --> 05:45.817
Thought so.

05:45.819 --> 05:47.789
One for the road?

05:57.731 --> 05:59.498
I'll never forget you.

05:59.500 --> 06:01.168
I guarantee it.

06:28.027 --> 06:29.529
Not bad.

06:32.666 --> 06:37.004
Now, what were you looking
at in the closet?

06:43.010 --> 06:44.644
Now we're talkin'.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.233
Erica?

07:08.235 --> 07:09.633
<i>I'm almost done.</i>

07:09.635 --> 07:11.101
Bring the car around.

07:11.103 --> 07:13.270
What took you so long?
I was getting worried.

07:13.272 --> 07:15.876
I can't have a little fun
once and a while?

07:35.295 --> 07:36.931
No way.

08:00.620 --> 08:03.024
Oh, my god.

08:17.303 --> 08:19.070
How'd it go?

08:19.072 --> 08:21.205
What's that?

08:21.207 --> 08:23.173
Early retirement.

08:23.175 --> 08:24.274
What?

08:24.276 --> 08:25.680
Drive.

09:10.724 --> 09:12.256
Oh, my god.

09:12.258 --> 09:15.226
How much do you think
this is worth?

09:15.228 --> 09:17.861
If the quality's as good
as I think it is...

09:17.863 --> 09:22.000
altogether, a million.

09:22.002 --> 09:23.901
Probably more.

09:23.903 --> 09:28.273
But who would leave a million
in diamonds in a hotel room?

09:28.275 --> 09:30.942
Someone up to no good who needed
them close at hand...

09:30.944 --> 09:32.110
in case he had to move fast.

09:32.112 --> 09:33.977
Who's bound to come after us.

09:33.979 --> 09:36.213
So? I was careful.

09:36.215 --> 09:39.183
I'm always careful.

09:39.185 --> 09:41.388
Well, he knows what you
look like.

09:47.960 --> 09:50.428
I like it.

09:50.430 --> 09:52.463
Don't worry, we'll play it safe.

09:52.465 --> 09:55.769
We'll head to the safe house,
lay low for a couple of months.

09:58.204 --> 09:59.871
What do I always say?

09:59.873 --> 10:01.305
It's good to be bad?

10:01.307 --> 10:02.876
So very good.

10:05.445 --> 10:06.910
Hey, what's the matter?

10:06.912 --> 10:08.379
Not another attack
of conscience?

10:08.381 --> 10:10.247
I'm just scared, Erica.

10:10.249 --> 10:11.982
This is a little more than
stealing from a guy's wallet.

10:11.984 --> 10:14.452
He's never gonna come after us.

10:14.454 --> 10:18.188
You should be jumping with joy.
We hit a jackpot.

10:18.190 --> 10:21.192
Come on, cheer up.

10:21.194 --> 10:22.293
Let's go.

10:42.047 --> 10:45.884
- Henry. How you doing?
- Erica!

10:45.886 --> 10:47.919
What are you doing here,
beautiful?

10:47.921 --> 10:49.788
It's the wrong time of year.

10:49.790 --> 10:51.255
I just needed to get away
for a while.

10:51.257 --> 10:52.856
- Uh-huh.
- This is Lauren.

10:52.858 --> 10:54.424
Oh, hi.

10:54.426 --> 10:56.561
Better watch out, she'll get you
into all kinds of trouble.

10:56.563 --> 10:58.496
Oh, don't I already know that?

10:58.498 --> 11:00.531
You got me all wrong, Henry.

11:00.533 --> 11:02.332
I guess you wanna make a trip
out to the island?

11:02.334 --> 11:03.967
If it's not too much trouble.

11:03.969 --> 11:07.105
Well, you know, it is such
a long way aways...

11:07.107 --> 11:10.808
and I'm not scheduled to go out
there 'til the end of the week.

11:10.810 --> 11:14.978
I'm sure we can make some
arrangement, Henry.

11:14.980 --> 11:18.882
Uh, let me help you
with that luggage.

11:18.884 --> 11:20.987
Oh, thank you, Henry.

11:29.461 --> 11:31.962
Welcome to Isabel Island.

11:31.964 --> 11:34.031
This is really where you live?

11:34.033 --> 11:36.035
When I'm not on the road.

11:37.838 --> 11:41.039
To the locals, I'm a divorcee
from New York.

11:41.041 --> 11:43.006
Erica, what?

11:43.008 --> 11:45.845
We'll come up with your
backstory later.

11:48.415 --> 11:50.448
It may not look like much...

11:50.450 --> 11:53.153
but it's the only real home
I've ever had.

12:03.430 --> 12:05.465
Home, sweet home.

12:14.174 --> 12:15.472
It's... it's nice.

12:15.474 --> 12:18.311
All the comforts, even satellite
broadband.

12:20.512 --> 12:22.282
Spare room is back here.

12:30.223 --> 12:31.990
What are you doing?

12:31.992 --> 12:35.293
Searching for any news
about the diamonds.

12:35.295 --> 12:38.395
You think he called the police?

12:38.397 --> 12:40.500
Depends on where he got them.

12:45.939 --> 12:49.406
What? What's wrong?

12:49.408 --> 12:51.241
He's dead.

12:51.243 --> 12:52.342
Who's dead?

12:52.344 --> 12:54.145
- Purcell.
- What?

12:54.147 --> 12:57.548
"Investigated, named Scott
Purcell...

12:57.550 --> 13:01.586
"found dead in his hotel room."

13:01.588 --> 13:03.288
Oh, my god, Erica.

13:03.290 --> 13:05.122
You think he's dead
because of us?

13:05.124 --> 13:08.092
No. He was obviously involved
with some dangerous people.

13:08.094 --> 13:09.593
That's nobody's fault
but his own.

13:09.595 --> 13:12.362
And what if those same people
just come after us.

13:12.364 --> 13:14.097
We're safe here.

13:14.099 --> 13:17.601
We didn't leave a trail.
We got away clean.

13:17.603 --> 13:21.105
"The victim was last identified
walking...

13:21.107 --> 13:22.606
"down the street with
a blonde woman."

13:22.608 --> 13:25.610
That's nothing, that's less
than nothing.

13:25.612 --> 13:28.115
Nobody knows who we are.
Nobody's gonna come find us.

13:30.450 --> 13:33.052
Oh, my god, he's dead, Erica.
He's dead.

13:36.690 --> 13:38.255
Listen to me.

13:38.257 --> 13:42.228
This had nothing to do
with what we did, okay?

13:43.629 --> 13:46.430
What's done is done.

13:46.432 --> 13:49.534
We'll stick together and get
through this, understand?

13:49.536 --> 13:51.269
Mm-hm.

13:51.271 --> 13:53.737
And when this is over,
we'll go far, far away...

13:53.739 --> 13:56.109
and forget this ever happened.

14:00.446 --> 14:04.148
I don't think I can forget
something like this.

14:04.150 --> 14:06.717
You'll be surprised...

14:06.719 --> 14:09.923
at what you can teach
yourself to forget.

14:42.454 --> 14:44.322
We'll bury the diamonds
until we need them...

14:44.324 --> 14:47.191
and get rid of the case.

14:47.193 --> 14:49.163
Well, where are we gonna
put the case?

15:02.374 --> 15:05.675
I know this isn't the most
exciting spot in the world.

15:05.677 --> 15:09.048
I like a little peace and quiet.

15:10.249 --> 15:12.151
Why did you pick me?

15:13.520 --> 15:14.751
What?

15:14.753 --> 15:17.123
Why did you make me
your partner?

15:20.493 --> 15:23.428
It's good to have someone
to watch your back.

15:23.430 --> 15:25.529
And since I don't trust men.

15:25.531 --> 15:27.130
You weren't my first partner...

15:27.132 --> 15:30.268
but you could have been
the best.

15:30.270 --> 15:32.370
With a face and body like
yours...

15:32.372 --> 15:36.043
men would have lined up
to be ripped off by you.

15:37.074 --> 15:38.275
It's too bad you didn't
get to try.

15:38.277 --> 15:42.779
It's quite a rush in the
beginning.

15:42.781 --> 15:46.683
So this was just a business
decision?

15:46.685 --> 15:48.088
Not entirely.

15:52.157 --> 15:53.824
It's good.

15:53.826 --> 15:56.360
It's good you're getting out
even before you begin.

15:56.362 --> 16:01.468
Before you turn into a cold,
heartless, bitch like me.

16:02.835 --> 16:05.071
It's not who you are.

16:10.743 --> 16:13.113
You're a poor judge
of character.

16:17.850 --> 16:21.120
You would have never made it
in this business.

16:40.672 --> 16:43.173
- Morning.
- Mm.

16:43.175 --> 16:44.574
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you.

16:44.576 --> 16:45.909
Oh.

16:45.911 --> 16:47.410
Are you okay?

16:47.412 --> 16:49.514
Yeah, I-I-I'm fine.
I'm fine.

16:49.516 --> 16:53.250
I'm Mike Frasier, the, uh,
local peacekeeper.

16:53.252 --> 16:56.754
Of course, if this place was
any more peaceful...

16:56.756 --> 16:58.725
they would all be asleep.

17:00.627 --> 17:03.727
I didn't know they had, uh, law
enforcement on this island.

17:03.729 --> 17:05.530
They didn't until recently.

17:05.531 --> 17:08.598
Um, I transferred into the
Isabel substation.

17:08.601 --> 17:11.902
- Oh.
- Your tax dollars at work.

17:11.904 --> 17:13.771
Tourist?

17:13.772 --> 17:15.605
I'm just staying with a friend
who has a cabin out here.

17:15.607 --> 17:18.275
That's nice. How long are
you staying?

17:18.277 --> 17:19.944
Just a couple of months.

17:19.945 --> 17:23.580
Wow... what job has that kind
of vacation plan?

17:23.583 --> 17:25.348
Uh, hey, I'm sorry.

17:25.351 --> 17:27.919
I'm not trying to give you the
third degree, just...

17:27.921 --> 17:30.420
- Just making conversation.
- Oh, no.

17:30.422 --> 17:33.623
I don't think I caught
your name.

17:33.625 --> 17:37.928
Oh, it's, uh... uh, Lauren,
um, Lauren Hailey.

17:37.930 --> 17:41.332
Pleasure to meet you, Lauren.
Maybe I'll see you around.

17:41.334 --> 17:43.336
Yeah.

17:50.943 --> 17:53.444
Who was that?

17:53.446 --> 17:57.480
Uh, just some new sheriff
or something.

17:57.482 --> 17:59.449
What are we gonna do?

17:59.451 --> 18:03.257
Nothing. We're law-abiding
citizens, remember?

18:08.561 --> 18:12.630
But, why did he come up to me?

18:12.632 --> 18:15.666
Because you're the most gorgeous
thing around here on two legs.

18:15.668 --> 18:16.766
Ugh.

18:16.768 --> 18:18.636
Except for me, of course.

18:18.638 --> 18:21.005
Aw! You.

18:21.007 --> 18:22.907
Oh, I'm just kidding.

18:22.909 --> 18:26.509
No, it's, y-you're funny,
that's what you are.

18:26.511 --> 18:28.514
Yeah, well, someone has to be.

19:37.583 --> 19:39.015
Have you thought about what
you'll do...

19:39.017 --> 19:40.583
with your cut of the money?

19:40.585 --> 19:43.454
I don't know.

19:43.456 --> 19:45.022
I'm heading to the Caymans...

19:45.024 --> 19:47.725
to buy a little bungalow
on the beach.

19:47.727 --> 19:49.659
You're welcome to come along.

19:49.661 --> 19:52.530
I'll think about it.

19:52.532 --> 19:55.365
Whatever you decide to do,
remember one thing.

19:55.367 --> 19:58.002
Don't become attached to
anything.

20:06.446 --> 20:07.578
Want anything?

20:07.580 --> 20:10.514
No, I'm gonna take me a bath.

20:10.516 --> 20:12.115
In the middle of the day?

20:12.117 --> 20:14.051
What's wrong with that?

20:14.053 --> 20:17.291
That guilt you're carrying
around, won't just wash off.

21:22.555 --> 21:24.688
- Hi, there.
- Oh gosh.

21:24.690 --> 21:27.425
Sorry, I seem to have
done it again.

21:27.427 --> 21:30.428
I have a knack for scaring you.

21:30.430 --> 21:32.162
What are you doing here?

21:32.164 --> 21:34.198
Ah, just hiking around
the island.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.167
Getting to know the place.

21:36.169 --> 21:38.701
Hoping to hell I didn't make the
wrong decision coming here.

21:38.703 --> 21:40.638
Where's your uniform?

21:40.640 --> 21:43.440
Uh, I'm always on duty, luckily
I don't have to wear the gun...

21:43.442 --> 21:45.609
and the badge 24-7,
if I don't want to.

21:45.611 --> 21:48.547
Which is a good thing, because
it is a bitch in the shower.

21:50.115 --> 21:51.948
I see we're kinda heading
the same direction.

21:51.950 --> 21:53.484
Care for some company?

21:53.486 --> 21:55.785
Sure.

21:55.787 --> 21:58.488
You know, um, I'm an amateur
naturalist.

21:58.490 --> 21:59.590
Oh really?

21:59.592 --> 22:00.724
Oh yeah.

22:00.726 --> 22:01.758
So see this thing over here?

22:01.760 --> 22:02.860
Mm-hm.

22:02.862 --> 22:04.195
We call this a tree.

22:04.197 --> 22:05.463
Is it really?

22:05.465 --> 22:06.764
Yeah, yeah.

22:06.766 --> 22:08.698
Wow. I would have never known.

22:08.700 --> 22:11.034
Thought about taking some day
trips out to the mainland?

22:11.036 --> 22:12.803
I'd love to, but, uh...

22:12.805 --> 22:15.773
Erica says, we should probably
just stay on the island.

22:15.775 --> 22:16.940
Erica?

22:16.942 --> 22:18.476
Oh yeah, uh, that's the
friend...

22:18.478 --> 22:20.177
I was telling you,
I'm staying with.

22:20.179 --> 22:23.048
So do you always do everything
Erica says?

22:28.821 --> 22:30.787
I understand this is the highest
point on the island...

22:30.789 --> 22:32.823
Old Fort Jackson.

22:32.825 --> 22:34.524
You don't wanna get too close
to the edge...

22:34.526 --> 22:36.126
'cause it is a long way down.

22:36.128 --> 22:38.896
Oh. This has been really great
but, you know...

22:38.898 --> 22:40.764
I should probably be getting
back.

22:40.766 --> 22:42.166
Uh, yeah, yeah, of course.

22:42.168 --> 22:44.267
You heard about that restaurant
over on Harbor Row?

22:44.269 --> 22:46.937
I hear it's the best one
on the island.

22:46.939 --> 22:49.239
I hear it's the only one
on the island.

22:49.241 --> 22:52.008
True... true.

22:52.010 --> 22:54.245
Anyway, I was, um, just
wondering...

22:54.247 --> 22:57.881
if maybe you'd like to try
it out sometime.

22:57.883 --> 22:59.582
Okay, why not.

22:59.584 --> 23:03.653
Then I'll take why not,
pick you up at 7:00?

23:03.655 --> 23:06.290
I can't wait.

23:06.292 --> 23:07.658
Walk me back?

23:07.660 --> 23:09.662
Absolutely.

23:19.671 --> 23:21.138
Have you gone crazy?

23:21.140 --> 23:23.140
I have got to get out
of this cabin.

23:23.142 --> 23:26.209
It's been a week already and the
walls are closing in on me.

23:26.211 --> 23:29.947
I've gotta get out and get
things off my mind for a while.

23:29.949 --> 23:31.782
With the sheriff?

23:31.784 --> 23:33.617
He's a deputy.

23:33.619 --> 23:35.522
Oh yeah, that makes it okay
then?

23:36.855 --> 23:38.221
I'll be careful.

23:38.223 --> 23:40.123
I'm not gonna change your mind,
am I?

23:40.125 --> 23:41.992
Nope.

23:41.994 --> 23:43.893
Stick to the back story.

23:43.895 --> 23:48.332
Better still, don't talk
about your life...

23:48.334 --> 23:51.200
and keep him away from here.

23:51.202 --> 23:54.638
Look, I can handle it, okay?

23:54.640 --> 23:56.273
Uh, I don't know about that.

23:56.275 --> 24:01.748
You still got feelings and
that's gonna get you in trouble.

24:39.352 --> 24:41.118
Hey, Francine, how's it goin'?

24:41.120 --> 24:43.086
- What'll it be?
- Tequila.

24:43.088 --> 24:44.990
Ooh... rough day?

24:57.103 --> 25:00.903
Hey, who's the hunk?

25:00.905 --> 25:03.006
I don't know, he came
in a few days ago...

25:03.008 --> 25:07.044
but I do know he has
a very nice boat.

25:07.046 --> 25:08.648
Interesting.

25:12.684 --> 25:15.252
Think of a card.

25:15.254 --> 25:17.724
- Got it.
- Got it?

25:28.167 --> 25:30.637
Queen of diamonds?

25:31.970 --> 25:33.704
How did you know?

25:33.706 --> 25:36.172
I know that I have a beautiful
queen in front of me.

25:36.174 --> 25:40.811
And I also know that every queen
deserves to find her king.

25:40.813 --> 25:44.851
Look, give me your hand.

25:47.253 --> 25:48.451
Did you feel it?

25:48.453 --> 25:49.887
Feel what?

25:49.889 --> 25:52.659
Magic. Take a look.

25:57.028 --> 25:58.829
Can I offer you a drink?

25:58.831 --> 25:59.963
Who are you?

25:59.965 --> 26:01.832
- My name's Tom.
- Erica.

26:01.834 --> 26:03.801
Nice to meet you, Erica.

26:03.803 --> 26:05.201
What brings you to Isabel
Island?

26:05.203 --> 26:07.170
Checking out some real estate.

26:07.172 --> 26:08.971
Trust me, check somewhere else.

26:08.973 --> 26:10.239
Do you live here?

26:10.241 --> 26:12.109
Couple months out of the year.

26:12.111 --> 26:15.178
Well, there must be something
you like about this place.

26:15.180 --> 26:17.313
The privacy.

26:17.315 --> 26:19.315
So a big developer that
comes along...

26:19.317 --> 26:22.753
is not exactly your idea
of a good thing?

26:22.755 --> 26:25.389
I prefer the magician.

26:25.391 --> 26:28.391
Really?

26:28.393 --> 26:31.495
What do you do for a living?

26:31.497 --> 26:34.130
I like to play with fire.

26:34.132 --> 26:39.005
Oh, well, I'm sure fire
loves to play you.

26:46.277 --> 26:49.012
Thanks for dinner.

26:49.014 --> 26:51.782
I, uh, I really enjoyed
getting out.

26:51.784 --> 26:53.386
So did I.

26:54.853 --> 26:57.187
Thank you.

26:57.189 --> 27:00.023
So, your friend...

27:00.025 --> 27:01.158
Mm-hm.

27:01.160 --> 27:05.928
Erica... you must be close.

27:05.930 --> 27:11.267
You see, not too long ago,
I went through this really...

27:11.269 --> 27:15.941
bad time and she really
helped me out.

27:17.109 --> 27:18.307
You both from New York?

27:18.309 --> 27:19.409
Yeah.

27:19.411 --> 27:21.378
See, that's your problem.

27:21.380 --> 27:26.449
New York is too big, too many
people, too many distractions.

27:26.451 --> 27:28.185
You need a simpler lifestyle.

27:28.187 --> 27:32.255
And, uh, how do you know
what I need?

27:32.257 --> 27:36.126
Well, I know that you are a very
stressed young lady.

27:36.128 --> 27:37.960
You're so wound up...

27:37.962 --> 27:40.099
I'm surprised you're not
bouncing on the sidewalk.

27:41.432 --> 27:43.467
I-I don't know what you mean.

27:43.469 --> 27:46.503
At first, I thought it was me,
that you get nervous...

27:46.505 --> 27:50.040
hanging out with such
a charming, handsome guy.

27:50.042 --> 27:53.446
But somehow, I don't think
that's it.

27:55.213 --> 27:59.582
You ask way too many questions.

27:59.584 --> 28:02.221
And you don't like giving
answers.

28:05.423 --> 28:08.191
Lauren, look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

28:08.193 --> 28:10.994
Hey, hey, I got a big mouth,
all right?

28:10.996 --> 28:14.063
I forgot, the goal of a first
date...

28:14.065 --> 28:17.400
is to actually make a good
impression.

28:17.402 --> 28:20.469
Is this a first date?

28:20.471 --> 28:23.209
I hope it's not our last.

28:25.177 --> 28:27.076
I want to get to know you.

28:27.078 --> 28:31.247
And I think that might
take a while.

28:31.249 --> 28:32.549
You're right.

28:32.551 --> 28:34.884
Uh, about what?

28:34.886 --> 28:38.988
I, uh, I do have something
bothering me.

28:38.990 --> 28:42.959
But, I'm not going to tell you,
not ever.

28:42.961 --> 28:47.464
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
That is like a really long time.

28:47.466 --> 28:51.001
Well, you're just going to have
to accept that.

28:51.003 --> 28:53.239
Don't be so sure about that.

30:38.376 --> 30:42.178
Well, I have to say, you're
something else.

30:42.180 --> 30:44.982
So I've been told.

30:44.984 --> 30:47.050
You don't have to leave.

30:47.052 --> 30:49.386
Yes, I do.

30:49.388 --> 30:51.188
When can I see you again?

30:51.190 --> 30:55.057
Don't get any ideas.
This was a one-time deal.

30:55.059 --> 30:58.160
Hey, I'm perfectly fine with
that, it's just that...

30:58.162 --> 31:03.135
In that case... I'll let
you know.

31:40.405 --> 31:42.205
Was it intentional?

31:42.207 --> 31:44.807
I don't know. It could have
been a drunk driver.

31:44.809 --> 31:48.411
You said no one could
find us here.

31:48.413 --> 31:51.747
I mean, you were gone
for so long.

31:51.749 --> 31:54.284
Yeah, I was just out having
a few drinks.

31:54.286 --> 31:56.719
- Alone?
- With a guy.

31:56.721 --> 31:58.487
What guy?

31:58.489 --> 32:00.223
Some guy with a boat.

32:00.225 --> 32:02.391
- Erica.
- What?

32:02.393 --> 32:04.294
After all the grief
you gave me about Mike.

32:04.296 --> 32:07.464
I can keep things from getting
serious, but you...

32:07.466 --> 32:11.237
I see you like Mike and it's
gonna get us in trouble.

32:13.104 --> 32:17.009
I'm going to bed. Don't wake
me up before noon.

33:08.626 --> 33:10.560
Ow.

33:10.562 --> 33:12.129
What's the matter?

33:12.131 --> 33:13.463
Hurt my back last night.

33:13.465 --> 33:15.765
Ooh, dodging the car?

33:15.767 --> 33:18.235
Riding the waves
with Captain Steve.

33:18.237 --> 33:21.271
Oh, my god.

33:21.273 --> 33:24.841
Oh, god no, here comes
Captain Love Struck.

33:24.843 --> 33:27.244
Afternoon, ladies.

33:27.246 --> 33:28.844
Mike.

33:28.846 --> 33:30.780
What do you two have
planned on this lovely day?

33:30.782 --> 33:34.517
Uh, nothing special.

33:34.519 --> 33:36.386
Just another day in paradise?

33:36.388 --> 33:40.422
You need to look up the word
paradise.

33:40.424 --> 33:44.593
Well, since you don't have
anything special planned...

33:44.595 --> 33:47.596
today, maybe you'd like to do
something later?

33:47.598 --> 33:50.900
Uh, I'll let you know.

33:50.902 --> 33:54.303
Shouldn't you be out protecting
the innocent or something?

33:54.305 --> 33:56.305
Are you saying you aren't
innocent?

33:56.307 --> 33:59.708
She's...

33:59.710 --> 34:02.147
- I think I'm gonna go.
- Oh.

34:07.553 --> 34:09.522
- I'll call ya later.
- Okay.

34:13.625 --> 34:15.458
Last night, did you two...?

34:15.460 --> 34:16.960
No.

34:16.962 --> 34:19.862
You're gonna hurt him, you know.

34:19.864 --> 34:22.400
Like I care.

34:31.310 --> 34:33.210
- Lauren?
- Yeah?

34:33.212 --> 34:35.444
I want you to be real subtle
about this...

34:35.446 --> 34:37.647
but there is a guy
across the street.

34:37.649 --> 34:40.185
I want to know if he looks
familiar to you.

34:43.455 --> 34:44.654
I don't recognize him.

34:44.656 --> 34:46.355
What are you thinking?

34:46.357 --> 34:48.290
I don't know, I guess
I'm still seeing...

34:48.292 --> 34:49.928
those headlights coming
at me.

34:51.529 --> 34:53.730
Maybe we should leave
the island.

34:53.732 --> 34:58.601
You're saying you're willing
to leave your darling deputy.

34:58.603 --> 35:01.804
Erica...

35:01.806 --> 35:07.844
I know what we are
and what we've done.

35:07.846 --> 35:10.513
I already know what
I signed up for...

35:10.515 --> 35:15.652
and I have accepted the
consequences.

35:15.654 --> 35:21.794
I mean, it's never going
to be over...

35:25.564 --> 35:32.002
because no matter what, we'll
always have some stranger...

35:32.004 --> 35:36.538
looking at us, or we'll always
have to be on the move...

35:36.540 --> 35:42.578
because we'll never be sure.

35:42.580 --> 35:44.716
So my question to you
right now...

35:47.451 --> 35:50.823
is what do we do?

35:52.890 --> 35:58.027
We stay put... for now.

35:58.029 --> 35:59.732
Let's go.

36:26.625 --> 36:27.994
What are you doing here?

36:30.562 --> 36:33.062
I thought I'd surprise you.

36:33.064 --> 36:35.964
I don't like surprises.

36:35.966 --> 36:39.669
Well I was in the neighborhood
and I thought I had a chance.

36:39.671 --> 36:42.404
I thought we had an
understanding.

36:42.406 --> 36:44.540
Anyway, how did you find me?

36:44.542 --> 36:45.810
Well, it's a small island.

36:47.913 --> 36:49.112
What do you want?

36:49.114 --> 36:52.015
Well, I want many things...

36:52.017 --> 36:56.953
but the question is what
do we both want?

36:56.955 --> 36:59.989
This is what I get for messing
around in my own backyard.

36:59.991 --> 37:02.359
You're not staying long.

37:02.361 --> 37:04.397
It's up to you.

37:18.777 --> 37:22.779
I hope that rated as a good
experience.

37:22.781 --> 37:28.421
It was wonderful. You were
wonderful.

37:39.997 --> 37:41.730
- Mike?
- Yeah?

37:41.732 --> 37:43.868
There's something I have
to tell you.

37:47.004 --> 37:50.172
I don't think I'm gonna be
on this island any longer.

37:50.174 --> 37:53.042
I thought you were gonna
be here a couple of months.

37:53.044 --> 37:56.082
Erica and I, we decided
to leave.

37:58.082 --> 38:00.183
It's for the best.

38:00.185 --> 38:03.520
For the two of us, I mean.

38:03.522 --> 38:04.888
There's no chance it could've
worked.

38:04.890 --> 38:06.656
You don't know that.

38:06.658 --> 38:11.497
Yes, I do. I'm not the person
you think I am.

38:12.631 --> 38:17.199
Mike, I have done some things...

38:17.201 --> 38:19.469
Hey, it can't be that bad.

38:19.471 --> 38:22.504
It is.

38:22.506 --> 38:26.942
I take it this is the stuff
you can't talk about.

38:26.944 --> 38:30.078
Lauren, look, whatever it is,
it's in the past.

38:30.080 --> 38:32.114
Right?

38:32.116 --> 38:34.884
Hey, I know you well enough...

38:34.886 --> 38:37.487
to know that you're not
a bad person.

38:37.489 --> 38:39.522
I wish that was the truth.

38:39.524 --> 38:40.757
But you won't let me help you.

38:40.759 --> 38:42.792
Because there's nothing
you could do.

38:42.794 --> 38:44.997
Not if I don't know
what the problem is.

38:53.672 --> 38:56.475
I, uh, just want you to know
that I am...

38:58.109 --> 39:00.509
I'm really glad that we met.

39:00.511 --> 39:04.480
For the time that we have left
on this island, I really...

39:04.482 --> 39:07.750
think that it's best that
we just don't see...

39:07.752 --> 39:10.122
each other anymore, 'kay?

39:18.029 --> 39:19.765
If that's what you want.

39:21.799 --> 39:24.636
I think it'll just make things
easier for when I have to go.

39:43.821 --> 39:45.024
Erica?

39:49.828 --> 39:51.964
Erica?

39:53.732 --> 39:55.901
Hello?

40:10.614 --> 40:12.183
Erica?

40:25.330 --> 40:27.866
Erica?

40:29.768 --> 40:36.105
Um... um, Tom, Lauren.

40:36.107 --> 40:37.272
Lauren, Tom.

40:37.274 --> 40:39.777
Hey how is going?

40:42.913 --> 40:45.281
So you broke up with the deputy?

40:45.283 --> 40:46.982
He deserves better.

40:46.984 --> 40:48.250
Oh, come on.

40:48.252 --> 40:50.085
Don't put yourself down
like that.

40:50.087 --> 40:52.955
It's the truth.

40:52.957 --> 40:54.692
You'll thank me later.

40:56.294 --> 40:58.261
Are you still angry about Tom?

40:58.263 --> 41:01.634
- No.
- No?

41:03.335 --> 41:07.072
You don't really care about him.
You're just using him.

41:10.341 --> 41:12.942
Now you're getting it.

41:12.944 --> 41:15.678
Don't ever let them
get close to you.

41:15.680 --> 41:17.614
Never ever.

41:17.616 --> 41:19.681
Then you can forget them
and move on.

41:19.683 --> 41:23.122
- Erica, look.
- What?

41:28.292 --> 41:31.761
The current must wash around
here from the fort.

41:31.763 --> 41:34.767
Oh, my god, we'll have
to bury it.

41:38.236 --> 41:40.672
- Oh, my god.
- What?

41:43.140 --> 41:45.209
- What is it?
- It's a tracking device.

41:49.714 --> 41:51.781
Someone could have tracked
us here.

41:51.783 --> 41:53.016
What do we do?

41:53.018 --> 41:55.853
I'll have to destroy it... now.

42:11.069 --> 42:13.870
What do we do? Do we run?

42:13.872 --> 42:16.705
If someone knows we're here,
we've got to find out who it is.

42:16.707 --> 42:18.207
But surely if someone found
anything out...

42:18.209 --> 42:19.841
he wouldn't necessarily
know it was us.

42:19.843 --> 42:21.411
Oh, it would be easy
to find out.

42:21.413 --> 42:23.946
We arrived right after the
diamond theft.

42:23.948 --> 42:27.016
So, why hasn't he made his move?

42:27.018 --> 42:29.351
Maybe he already has.

42:29.353 --> 42:32.120
I want you to go online
and research...

42:32.122 --> 42:34.424
everything about your
ex-lover boy deputy.

42:34.426 --> 42:36.259
Check his story.

42:36.261 --> 42:37.859
You can't be serious.

42:37.861 --> 42:40.832
From now on, everyone
is a potential threat.

42:42.399 --> 42:44.132
Check out Tom Shepherd
as well...

42:44.134 --> 42:46.071
he's supposed to be in real
estate in San Diego.

42:47.205 --> 42:48.737
Close the doors and windows...

42:48.739 --> 42:52.143
and don't let anybody in
and I mean anybody.

43:00.451 --> 43:02.384
You look beaten down.

43:02.386 --> 43:06.054
How can the best and worst day
of my life be the same day?

43:06.056 --> 43:07.989
You want to talk about it?

43:07.991 --> 43:09.357
No.

43:09.359 --> 43:12.295
Good, I get so tired
of pretending to care.

43:12.297 --> 43:14.397
You want another whiskey?

43:14.399 --> 43:16.167
No, I'm good.

43:32.450 --> 43:34.951
It's Deputy Frasier
over on Isabel...

43:34.953 --> 43:37.053
I need you to run a name for me.

43:37.055 --> 43:38.955
Erica Tate.

43:38.957 --> 43:44.359
Mid-twenties, 5'6", could be
from New York.

43:44.361 --> 43:47.529
Yeah, any warrants or arrests.

43:47.531 --> 43:51.033
Also, um, run the name
Lauren Hailey.

43:51.035 --> 43:54.170
Yeah, mid-twenties.

43:54.172 --> 43:56.404
Nah, take your time.

43:56.406 --> 43:58.908
Try all the databases and fax
me what you find.

43:58.910 --> 44:00.411
Thanks.

46:12.377 --> 46:14.277
About time you got back.

46:14.279 --> 46:16.511
What are you doing here?

46:16.513 --> 46:19.348
You surprised me yesterday, I
thought, I'll do the same.

46:19.350 --> 46:24.120
Magic, huh? You want more?

46:24.122 --> 46:27.556
Always.

46:27.558 --> 46:31.930
Well, I haven't even started to
show you what I'm able to do.

47:07.364 --> 47:09.531
What happened? You've been
gone so long.

47:09.533 --> 47:11.701
Nothing, I got delayed.
What did you find out?

47:11.703 --> 47:14.036
Well, their backgrounds check
out. I found reference...

47:14.038 --> 47:16.571
on Mike working at the
sheriff's office in Phoenix...

47:16.573 --> 47:20.208
and Tom being a developer
in San Diego.

47:20.210 --> 47:23.312
That doesn't mean we can trust
them. Tomorrow we'll go out...

47:23.314 --> 47:25.982
and find out everyone
who's new to the island.

47:25.984 --> 47:27.583
How?

47:27.585 --> 47:31.754
Strangers stick out on Isabel.
You need to get some rest.

47:31.756 --> 47:34.089
What about you?

47:34.091 --> 47:38.560
I'm not closing eyes until
this is over.

47:50.607 --> 47:53.174
Hey, you, a bit early, isn't it?

47:53.176 --> 47:55.143
I didn't peg you for a morning
person.

47:55.145 --> 47:58.246
Who's arrived since I've been
here and stayed.

47:58.248 --> 47:59.748
Only the hunk.

47:59.750 --> 48:02.250
No one else? Are you sure?

48:02.252 --> 48:05.187
Wait a minute, there is this
other guy.

48:05.189 --> 48:08.690
He's only been in here once and,
I've seen him around.

48:08.692 --> 48:09.792
Does he have a boat?

48:09.794 --> 48:11.527
I don't think so...

48:11.529 --> 48:14.230
he came in the same day
Henry did the supply check.

48:14.232 --> 48:16.065
His name is Bill Teague.

48:16.067 --> 48:17.500
What's this about?

48:17.502 --> 48:20.402
It's about forgetting
that I ever asked.

48:20.404 --> 48:22.170
You got it, girl.

48:22.172 --> 48:23.274
Thank you.

48:33.384 --> 48:35.283
His name is Bill Teague.

48:35.285 --> 48:38.054
He's the same guy we saw
from the café.

48:38.056 --> 48:42.091
Erica, maybe no one is after us.

48:42.093 --> 48:44.460
Maybe Scott Purcell put the
tracking device in the case...

48:44.462 --> 48:47.263
and not his killer.

48:47.265 --> 48:50.199
Are you willing to bet
your life on it?

48:50.201 --> 48:53.038
I'm gonna keep digging
until I'm sure.

48:56.140 --> 48:58.140
There he goes.
I want you to follow him.

48:58.142 --> 48:59.641
Okay.

48:59.643 --> 49:01.810
Don't let him see you,
I'll check his room.

49:01.812 --> 49:03.446
Wait, how will you get in?

49:03.448 --> 49:05.549
It's not exactly Fort Knox.

49:57.868 --> 49:59.268
Lauren?

49:59.270 --> 50:00.435
Mike?

50:00.437 --> 50:02.138
We need to talk.

50:02.140 --> 50:06.408
Uh, I'm sorry, w-we really have
nothing to talk about.

50:06.410 --> 50:09.748
Yes, we do... Erica Tate.

50:27.397 --> 50:29.297
Oh, god.

50:29.299 --> 50:31.167
She has quite the rap sheet
there, Lauren...

50:31.169 --> 50:33.337
but I'm guessing you already
knew that.

50:50.453 --> 50:52.888
Now, I don't have any idea
what you've done...

50:52.890 --> 50:54.489
but as far as the law
is concerned...

50:54.491 --> 50:56.491
there are open warrants on her.

50:56.493 --> 50:58.861
Mike...

50:58.863 --> 51:02.198
I told you I was not the person
who you thought I was.

51:02.200 --> 51:03.866
I don't care what happened
in the past, all right.

51:03.868 --> 51:06.601
All I'm worried about
is right now.

51:06.603 --> 51:11.707
Get away while you still can,
just walk away from her.

51:11.709 --> 51:14.643
Look, I don't know if you'll
believe me...

51:14.645 --> 51:18.480
but I have already made the
decision to do that, okay?

51:18.482 --> 51:21.616
Yeah, I believe you.

51:21.618 --> 51:23.451
I have to do something, okay?

51:23.453 --> 51:24.886
I- I have to finish
what we started...

51:24.888 --> 51:28.457
and I can't let Erica
do it alone, I can't...

51:28.459 --> 51:30.491
so just take this.

51:30.493 --> 51:33.929
Leave me alone, just, uh,
stay away from me.

51:33.931 --> 51:36.334
From the both of us, okay?

52:03.326 --> 52:07.462
I'm sorry. I-I lost him.

52:07.464 --> 52:09.498
It doesn't matter, he's our man.

52:09.500 --> 52:11.866
There are photos of the night
I was with Purcell.

52:11.868 --> 52:14.469
But how?

52:14.471 --> 52:16.404
He had to be tracking Purcell
when we showed up.

52:16.406 --> 52:17.973
And now he's tracking us.

52:31.355 --> 52:34.522
We're gonna draw him out here,
get him away from the town.

52:34.524 --> 52:36.692
- You mean, kill him?
- That's the only way.

52:36.694 --> 52:38.460
And what about when he
goes missing?

52:38.462 --> 52:39.828
We'll clear out his room.

52:39.830 --> 52:41.596
Leave some money on the dresser
to cover the bill.

52:41.598 --> 52:43.399
I doubt anyone will ever ask
any questions.

52:43.401 --> 52:46.734
Well, what if he has friends,
uh, families, partners?

52:46.736 --> 52:50.071
We'll be long gone, pick up new
identities on the way.

52:50.073 --> 52:53.007
It'll be over.

52:53.009 --> 52:57.578
I can't do this anymore.
I want out.

52:57.580 --> 52:59.380
Lauren, I told you...

52:59.382 --> 53:02.451
the days of picking up guys
in bars are over, okay?

53:02.453 --> 53:03.551
We'll have enough to...

53:03.553 --> 53:05.386
I don't want the diamond money!

53:05.388 --> 53:08.424
Look, I know you're upset, okay.

53:08.426 --> 53:11.794
But he came after us and he'll
keep coming until we're dead.

53:11.796 --> 53:14.462
I am not running out on you,
Lauren.

53:14.464 --> 53:17.635
Get down! Go! Go!

53:30.915 --> 53:32.584
Go. Go!

53:39.924 --> 53:41.893
- What are you going to do?
- Stay here.

54:00.643 --> 54:03.647
Lauren! I asked you to wait
inside!

54:05.783 --> 54:07.618
I think I lost him.

54:09.053 --> 54:10.788
Let's get back in.

54:17.395 --> 54:20.094
Did you see who it was?

54:20.096 --> 54:23.598
He was too far away.

54:23.600 --> 54:25.868
I don't think he was trying
to kill us.

54:25.870 --> 54:27.770
What?

54:27.772 --> 54:29.538
He was trying to scare us
thinking we'll grab 'em...

54:29.540 --> 54:30.938
and go and that's when
he'll get us.

54:30.940 --> 54:33.509
You're gonna have to stay,
after all.

54:33.511 --> 54:36.444
'Cause if you leave now, he'll
think you've got the diamonds...

54:36.446 --> 54:39.013
and he'll go after you.

54:39.015 --> 54:41.650
Wha-what do we do?

54:41.652 --> 54:45.590
The plan hasn't changed.
We kill him before he kills us.

56:00.763 --> 56:02.598
I'm going to keep
an eye on Teague...

56:02.600 --> 56:04.165
we've got to be ready
the next time he shows up.

56:04.167 --> 56:05.266
Let me go with you.

56:05.268 --> 56:08.504
It's easier to follow him alone.

56:08.506 --> 56:10.571
- Here.
- Oh no, you take it.

56:10.573 --> 56:12.975
If I miss him, use it
like I showed you.

56:12.977 --> 56:15.180
Please, be careful.

58:08.257 --> 58:09.357
Hello?

58:09.359 --> 58:11.627
Hey, it's Tom.

58:11.629 --> 58:14.228
Well, listen, I just wanted to
tell you that I'm leaving.

58:14.230 --> 58:15.897
What?

58:15.899 --> 58:18.766
<i>I have to go back to San Diego.</i>

58:18.768 --> 58:20.134
I'm sorry, my dear...

58:20.136 --> 58:22.036
I didn't want to go
without saying goodbye.

58:22.038 --> 58:25.906
<i>It was fun,
Erica, we had some laughs.</i>

58:25.908 --> 58:27.775
So did I.

58:27.777 --> 58:30.879
Hey, I promise you next time
I'll be back, I'll look you up.

58:30.881 --> 58:33.382
You do that.

58:33.384 --> 58:35.719
<i>See you soon, baby.</i>

59:41.417 --> 59:43.884
Mike, you shouldn't be here.

59:43.886 --> 59:47.121
I just found these a couple
yards from the cabin.

59:47.123 --> 59:48.824
They'd just been fired.

59:48.826 --> 59:50.826
You wanna tell me what the
hell's going on?

59:50.828 --> 59:54.161
Can't you just leave me alone?

59:54.163 --> 59:56.230
- Where's Erica?
- She's not here.

59:56.232 --> 59:57.732
Okay, I want to talk to her.

59:57.734 --> 01:00:00.268
No, you'll only make things
worse.

01:00:00.270 --> 01:00:02.971
I can help you.

01:00:02.973 --> 01:00:07.308
You can't help me and still be
the person that you are.

01:00:07.310 --> 01:00:09.377
Lauren, look...

01:00:09.379 --> 01:00:12.913
just forget that I'm a deputy
sheriff, all right?

01:00:12.915 --> 01:00:16.183
Whatever trouble it is, my only
concern is for you.

01:00:16.185 --> 01:00:19.020
Look, if you really have
feelings for me...

01:00:19.022 --> 01:00:22.424
please just don't get involved
in this.

01:00:26.330 --> 01:00:29.498
I-I gotta take this.

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:32.400
Deputy Frasier.

01:00:32.402 --> 01:00:35.136
What?

01:00:35.138 --> 01:00:36.304
'Kay, calm down.

01:00:36.306 --> 01:00:38.940
How badly are you hurt?

01:00:38.942 --> 01:00:40.210
Hello?

01:00:42.178 --> 01:00:45.913
Some hiker's hurt himself
out at Fort Jackson.

01:00:45.915 --> 01:00:47.785
Look, I gotta go, but I'll
be back, okay?

01:01:00.297 --> 01:01:02.163
Erica!

01:01:02.165 --> 01:01:05.132
I'm outside the motel, but I
haven't seen any sign of Teague.

01:01:05.134 --> 01:01:06.534
So be on the lookout.

01:01:06.536 --> 01:01:07.868
Mike came by.

01:01:07.870 --> 01:01:09.404
What did he want?

01:01:09.406 --> 01:01:11.272
He wants to talk to you,
he knows something is wrong.

01:01:11.274 --> 01:01:12.540
What have you said to him?

01:01:12.542 --> 01:01:14.275
<i>Nothing.</i>

01:01:14.277 --> 01:01:16.210
<i>Things are getting way...</i>

01:01:16.212 --> 01:01:18.480
<i>too hot around here, we'll have
to take our chances and run.</i>

01:01:18.482 --> 01:01:20.315
<i>I'll head back.</i>

01:01:20.317 --> 01:01:23.286
Get ready to move fast.
I'll call Henry for a lift.

01:01:54.151 --> 01:01:56.386
Hello?

01:01:58.087 --> 01:01:59.823
Hello?

01:02:01.892 --> 01:02:03.027
Hello?

01:02:19.009 --> 01:02:21.243
- Are you ready?
- I'm almost packed.

01:02:21.245 --> 01:02:23.078
Forget that, we have to travel
light and fast.

01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:24.913
We'll take the clothes on our
backs and the diamonds.

01:02:26.315 --> 01:02:28.118
- What's that?
- Uh...

01:02:29.953 --> 01:02:32.254
It's Mike's SUV.

01:02:32.256 --> 01:02:35.056
What is he doing here?

01:02:35.058 --> 01:02:36.828
I'll deal with him, get ready.

01:02:43.933 --> 01:02:45.535
Deputy Frasier?

01:03:00.450 --> 01:03:02.018
Erica!

01:03:05.922 --> 01:03:08.926
Erica! Erica!

01:03:13.263 --> 01:03:15.266
- Erica!
- Lauren!

01:03:46.663 --> 01:03:48.366
Go!

01:04:08.451 --> 01:04:10.051
Is he still following?

01:04:10.053 --> 01:04:12.056
I don't know, but we need
to keep going.

01:04:13.689 --> 01:04:16.091
Hold it right there.

01:04:16.093 --> 01:04:17.928
Don't move.

01:04:25.002 --> 01:04:26.567
No, no, no, I...

01:04:26.569 --> 01:04:29.536
I'll give you the damned
diamonds, just let us go.

01:04:29.538 --> 01:04:32.609
Wh-wh-what the hell are you
talking about?

01:04:34.477 --> 01:04:38.612
No, no, no, get back
to the cabin, let's go, go.

01:04:38.614 --> 01:04:41.618
Move! Faster!

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:44.585
Who are you?

01:04:44.587 --> 01:04:47.022
You don't remember me, do you?

01:04:47.024 --> 01:04:49.024
So how many has it been?

01:04:49.026 --> 01:04:52.393
Dozens? Hundreds?

01:04:52.395 --> 01:04:53.527
Oh, my god.

01:04:53.529 --> 01:04:56.730
How many lives have you ruined?

01:04:56.732 --> 01:04:58.766
- Oh, my god.
- That's right.

01:04:58.768 --> 01:05:00.435
Am... am I coming back to you?

01:05:00.437 --> 01:05:03.170
Let me refresh your memory.

01:05:03.172 --> 01:05:06.207
Saint Petersburg, Florida?
Three years ago?

01:05:06.209 --> 01:05:08.409
I'm not good with names
or faces...

01:05:08.411 --> 01:05:12.246
Bill Teague, pharmaceutical rep,
I was there for a convention.

01:05:12.248 --> 01:05:16.784
I never cheated on my wife.
Never!

01:05:16.786 --> 01:05:20.721
That's what this is about?
It couldn't have been that much.

01:05:20.723 --> 01:05:22.390
Get over it.

01:05:22.392 --> 01:05:24.692
When you left that night, yeah.

01:05:24.694 --> 01:05:29.196
That's right, she found out
what happened.

01:05:29.198 --> 01:05:32.199
Do you know what you
took from me?

01:05:32.201 --> 01:05:34.669
Everything!

01:05:34.671 --> 01:05:38.806
You took my wife! You took
my kids!

01:05:38.808 --> 01:05:42.710
You took my job,
you took my life!

01:05:42.712 --> 01:05:46.547
Do you know the pain
that you caused me?

01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:50.118
Do you even care?

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:52.786
Do you?

01:05:52.788 --> 01:05:54.721
Well, I'm gonna make sure...

01:05:54.723 --> 01:05:58.625
that it never happens again...
to anyone!

01:05:58.627 --> 01:06:02.696
Move! Move.

01:06:02.698 --> 01:06:04.534
Under there.

01:06:05.234 --> 01:06:07.569
Move!

01:06:07.571 --> 01:06:09.370
How did you find me?

01:06:09.372 --> 01:06:14.275
I saw you in Atlantic City
four weeks ago.

01:06:14.277 --> 01:06:17.478
Hair was different, but I knew
it was you.

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:19.350
I've been following you
ever since.

01:06:22.252 --> 01:06:24.451
But, why kill Purcell?

01:06:24.453 --> 01:06:25.789
I don't know any Purcell.

01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:30.324
I've only killed one person,
so far.

01:06:30.326 --> 01:06:33.661
You know, it was surprisingly
easy...

01:06:33.663 --> 01:06:35.395
when you have nothing to lose.

01:06:35.397 --> 01:06:37.665
What are you doing
with Mike's SUV?

01:06:37.667 --> 01:06:39.766
Won't be needing that anymore.

01:06:39.768 --> 01:06:43.304
No... no.

01:06:43.306 --> 01:06:44.906
You're lying.

01:06:44.908 --> 01:06:46.908
Oh, I would have killed
your lover, too.

01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:49.511
But he got away before
I could get to it.

01:06:49.513 --> 01:06:50.879
You sick freak.

01:06:50.881 --> 01:06:54.681
I wanted you to feel the loss
that I felt.

01:06:54.683 --> 01:06:58.453
Take everything from you, like
you took everything from me.

01:06:58.455 --> 01:07:03.393
I think I did your wife a favor.

01:07:09.165 --> 01:07:10.401
Move!

01:07:14.603 --> 01:07:16.538
I'll be back with a shovel
later.

01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:20.775
She wasn't with me then.
She wasn't a part of it.

01:07:20.777 --> 01:07:22.342
Well, she's a part of it now.

01:07:22.344 --> 01:07:25.547
And you obviously care about her
very much.

01:07:28.618 --> 01:07:29.652
Answer it.

01:07:32.455 --> 01:07:34.589
Hello?

01:07:34.591 --> 01:07:37.725
I called for a boat earlier.

01:07:37.727 --> 01:07:40.895
You tell him that you won't be
needing it any longer...

01:07:40.897 --> 01:07:43.433
but you know somebody who will.

01:07:45.801 --> 01:07:48.469
Henry, there has been
a change of plans.

01:07:48.471 --> 01:07:52.376
I'm staying, but I know someone
who needs off the island.

01:07:54.611 --> 01:07:57.946
Yeah, he'll pay what I pay.

01:07:57.948 --> 01:08:00.348
You tell him I'll be there
in a couple of hours.

01:08:00.350 --> 01:08:04.518
Can you wait for two hours?

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:06.623
He'll meet you at the dock.

01:08:10.326 --> 01:08:12.560
I can make you a very rich man.

01:08:12.562 --> 01:08:13.995
Those diamonds I mentioned
earlier...

01:08:13.997 --> 01:08:17.765
I don't care anything
about any diamonds.

01:08:17.767 --> 01:08:20.401
We're talking about millions
of dollars.

01:08:20.403 --> 01:08:23.703
That can buy a lot
of forgiveness.

01:08:23.706 --> 01:08:25.471
Think of it...

01:08:25.474 --> 01:08:30.446
you can rebuild your life,
your family, everything.

01:08:33.381 --> 01:08:34.948
I'll make the deal even sweeter.

01:08:34.951 --> 01:08:38.352
All the money, if you let
Lauren go...

01:08:38.354 --> 01:08:40.487
and you can do what you want
with me.

01:08:40.488 --> 01:08:42.788
Erica, no.

01:08:42.791 --> 01:08:44.892
Shut up, Lauren, Bill's right.

01:08:44.894 --> 01:08:48.828
I've done some very bad things
and I deserve to be punished.

01:08:48.831 --> 01:08:51.832
No, I won't let you sacrifice
yourself for me!

01:08:51.835 --> 01:08:52.966
It's my life.

01:08:52.969 --> 01:08:54.301
Erica, he's psycho!

01:08:54.304 --> 01:08:55.636
- So what!
- Please!

01:08:55.639 --> 01:08:58.640
Shut up, you heard the man,
shut up.

01:08:58.642 --> 01:09:02.343
Shut up! Shut up, both of you!

01:09:02.345 --> 01:09:04.881
Shut... up.

01:09:13.456 --> 01:09:15.423
- Tie him up.
- I'm gonna get the rope.

01:09:15.425 --> 01:09:17.228
It's in Mike's SUV.

01:09:41.850 --> 01:09:43.084
What are we gonna do with him?

01:09:43.086 --> 01:09:45.386
- Oh, what do you think?
- Oh, no.

01:09:45.388 --> 01:09:46.886
Lauren, he's crazy.

01:09:46.889 --> 01:09:50.024
He killed Mike and he won't stop
until we're dead.

01:09:50.026 --> 01:09:53.660
I am not going to have blood
on my hand anymore.

01:09:53.662 --> 01:09:56.030
He knows all about us.

01:09:56.032 --> 01:09:58.799
The police, the FBI, everybody
will be after us.

01:09:58.801 --> 01:10:00.935
I don't care.

01:10:00.937 --> 01:10:04.808
I'll go get the diamonds.
We'll talk when I get back.

01:10:36.005 --> 01:10:37.808
Lauren!

01:12:07.063 --> 01:12:10.901
Lauren! Lauren!

01:12:17.172 --> 01:12:18.839
Tom?

01:12:18.841 --> 01:12:21.476
I understand you're a bit
of a con artist...

01:12:21.478 --> 01:12:23.477
but I'm pretty sure you were
not expecting...

01:12:23.479 --> 01:12:24.911
to be conned yourself, right?

01:12:24.913 --> 01:12:26.246
Where's Lauren?

01:12:26.248 --> 01:12:31.621
She's here, with me,
on the boat.

01:12:34.090 --> 01:12:35.859
<i>Let me talk to her.</i>

01:12:37.926 --> 01:12:39.696
Talk to your friend.

01:12:41.096 --> 01:12:42.965
Go to hell!

01:12:47.202 --> 01:12:50.804
Oh god, fuck! Fuck.

01:12:50.806 --> 01:12:54.542
I have what you want,
you have what I want!

01:12:54.544 --> 01:12:56.878
Let's make an even trade, right?

01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:58.612
Where?

01:12:58.614 --> 01:12:59.780
<i>On the boat.</i>

01:12:59.782 --> 01:13:01.582
No.

01:13:01.584 --> 01:13:02.682
<i>Well, I'm not gonna do it...</i>

01:13:02.684 --> 01:13:03.851
<i>in the middle of town!</i>

01:13:03.853 --> 01:13:05.218
Fort Jackson.

01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:06.920
Where is it?

01:13:06.922 --> 01:13:09.557
<i>Lauren knows the way.</i>

01:13:09.559 --> 01:13:13.527
You've got thirty minutes.

01:13:13.529 --> 01:13:16.062
It's better for you if your
friend shows up.

01:13:16.064 --> 01:13:17.500
You know that?

01:13:21.737 --> 01:13:24.474
You fucking sicko.

01:13:40.156 --> 01:13:42.626
Toss the gun!

01:13:48.564 --> 01:13:49.966
Slowly.

01:13:59.274 --> 01:14:01.241
Stop.

01:14:01.243 --> 01:14:03.977
You searched my purse.

01:14:03.979 --> 01:14:06.750
You checked my boat.

01:14:08.917 --> 01:14:11.718
It was you, all along.

01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:13.853
Magic, right?

01:14:13.855 --> 01:14:15.591
Where are my diamonds?

01:14:27.236 --> 01:14:31.705
Who are you? Tell me.

01:14:31.707 --> 01:14:35.308
Tell me or I swear,
I'll throw them.

01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:38.648
You know, becoming your lover
was not part of the plan...

01:14:39.849 --> 01:14:42.616
but I did really enjoy it.

01:14:42.618 --> 01:14:45.052
Problem is that when I shot
at you at your home...

01:14:45.054 --> 01:14:47.154
you were supposed to grab
the diamonds...

01:14:47.156 --> 01:14:50.624
and come running to me to get
off the island, but you didn't.

01:14:50.626 --> 01:14:53.360
Running to a man isn't my style.

01:14:53.362 --> 01:14:57.130
Oh no, your style is stealing
from a man.

01:14:57.132 --> 01:14:58.798
Who owns these diamonds?

01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:00.801
One of my men stole them
from me.

01:15:00.803 --> 01:15:05.242
Purcell... you killed him.

01:15:07.175 --> 01:15:09.879
Now, give me my diamonds.

01:15:14.017 --> 01:15:16.150
Stay back.

01:15:16.152 --> 01:15:18.956
Show me the diamonds
are inside there.

01:15:28.965 --> 01:15:30.698
Satisfied?

01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:31.865
Give it to me.

01:15:31.867 --> 01:15:34.200
Close enough.

01:15:34.202 --> 01:15:36.404
How much money do you think
I hold in my hands?

01:15:36.406 --> 01:15:39.176
Twenty thousand? Thirty?

01:15:42.679 --> 01:15:47.048
Stop it! Stop it, for god's
sake.

01:15:47.050 --> 01:15:48.883
How would you like
to lose them all?

01:15:48.885 --> 01:15:50.153
All right.

01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:53.454
Lauren, take the Jeep and go,
now.

01:15:53.456 --> 01:15:54.989
No, please, I'm not leaving
you alone.

01:15:54.991 --> 01:15:57.894
You're wasting my time!
Give me my diamonds!

01:15:59.095 --> 01:16:00.664
Wasn't it all a waste of time?

01:16:01.964 --> 01:16:04.134
You saying you faked it.

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:14.074
Erica!

01:16:19.782 --> 01:16:21.184
Erica!

01:18:01.584 --> 01:18:02.883
Hey, Tom.

01:18:02.885 --> 01:18:04.354
Catch!

01:18:11.126 --> 01:18:12.328
Mike!

01:18:17.265 --> 01:18:19.169
Not so tight.

01:18:21.403 --> 01:18:24.206
- Let's get you up, okay?
- Okay.

01:18:30.246 --> 01:18:32.213
I heard everything.

01:18:32.215 --> 01:18:34.315
What happens now?

01:18:34.317 --> 01:18:38.451
Well, I call the Sheriff's
office...

01:18:38.453 --> 01:18:41.588
and I report I was
in an accident...

01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:44.557
coming back from Old Fort
Jackson...

01:18:44.559 --> 01:18:47.594
after discovering that someone
fell off the cliff.

01:18:47.596 --> 01:18:49.463
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:18:49.465 --> 01:18:51.298
- Thank you.
- What about Bill Teague?

01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:52.967
Who?

01:18:52.969 --> 01:18:55.335
That man that Tom killed,
who was also after us.

01:18:55.337 --> 01:18:57.137
I think he's going to
disappear...

01:18:57.139 --> 01:19:00.007
along with everything else
in his motel room.

01:19:00.009 --> 01:19:02.209
Is there anybody else?

01:19:02.211 --> 01:19:03.814
That should do it.

01:19:20.929 --> 01:19:23.463
Ladies, I'll give you guys
a moment alone.

01:19:23.465 --> 01:19:25.031
- Thank you.
- I'll take your bag.

01:19:25.033 --> 01:19:26.569
- I'll see you on the boat.
- All right, baby.

01:19:30.072 --> 01:19:34.240
So, uh, I guess this is it.

01:19:34.242 --> 01:19:36.610
I guess so.

01:19:36.612 --> 01:19:41.117
- What are you gonna do?
- What I always do... survive.

01:19:42.251 --> 01:19:44.151
You could just go straight.

01:19:44.153 --> 01:19:46.056
I'll give it some thought.

01:19:54.130 --> 01:19:59.033
Take care of your lover boy and
enjoy your normal life.

01:19:59.035 --> 01:20:01.604
You're not supposed to get
attached to people.

01:20:03.572 --> 01:20:05.575
Get going.
