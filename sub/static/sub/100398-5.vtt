00:06.549 --> 00:09.051
Previously on
Star Trek: Picard...

00:09.135 --> 00:10.177
Doctor Jurati,

00:10.261 --> 00:14.181
you can tell me if it is possible to make
a sentient android out of flesh and blood.

00:14.265 --> 00:17.852
No one has ever been able to redevelop
the science used to create Data.

00:17.935 --> 00:19.520
Then came Bruce Maddox.

00:19.603 --> 00:22.606
His theory was that Data's entire code,
even his memories,

00:22.690 --> 00:25.735
could be reconstituted
from a single positronic neuron.

00:25.818 --> 00:27.653
He disappeared after the ban.

00:27.737 --> 00:28.904
I have to go.

00:28.988 --> 00:30.573
Go where? Go how?

00:30.656 --> 00:31.800
You have to take me with you.

00:31.824 --> 00:33.784
I promise you,
I will more than earn my keep.

00:33.868 --> 00:34.869
You can't do it alone.

00:34.952 --> 00:35.995
You need a crew.

00:36.078 --> 00:37.872
I've already made the call.

00:37.955 --> 00:39.665
I need a ship and a pilot.

00:40.124 --> 00:42.251
And I have to find Bruce Maddox.

00:42.334 --> 00:43.711
I have a pilot for you.

00:43.794 --> 00:44.962
His name is Rios.

00:45.588 --> 00:47.298
Chris Rios. He's just an EMH.

00:47.381 --> 00:48.924
- "Just..."
- I'm...

00:49.008 --> 00:50.009
I know who you are.

00:50.092 --> 00:51.260
Deactivate EMH.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.679
Raffi says
you're the best around.

00:53.763 --> 00:55.181
I never argue with Raffi.

00:55.389 --> 00:56.974
Wise man.

01:00.311 --> 01:01.312
I found Maddox.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.023
- Where is he?
- On Freecloud.

01:04.106 --> 01:06.817
And once we get there, you're on your own.
I'm just hitching a ride.

01:06.901 --> 01:07.901
Hold on.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.239
Where did that come from?

01:14.325 --> 01:15.325
Magnificent pilot.

01:17.411 --> 01:18.454
His ship's breaking up.

01:18.537 --> 01:19.747
Raffi, beam him in.

01:19.830 --> 01:20.830
Do it.

01:24.835 --> 01:26.170
Seven of Nine?

01:26.253 --> 01:27.713
You owe me a ship, Picard.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.399
Where's your cortical node, buddy?

02:30.276 --> 02:31.694
Gotta be in there somewhere.

02:37.867 --> 02:39.493
Bjayzl?

02:44.957 --> 02:46.166
Seven?

02:49.712 --> 02:51.714
It's all right. You'll be all right.

02:53.215 --> 02:55.426
- Go...
- No. Not without you, Icheb.

03:04.894 --> 03:06.645
Then I'll stay with you.

03:06.729 --> 03:09.273
No, Seven.

03:11.859 --> 03:12.860
Please.

03:24.914 --> 03:28.125
I'm so sorry, my child.

04:07.498 --> 04:08.582
Ugh. What?

04:09.249 --> 04:11.126
Bruce Maddox.

04:14.088 --> 04:16.006
- Here?
- Indeed.

04:16.548 --> 04:17.548
Huh.

04:18.634 --> 04:20.260
How the mighty have fallen.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.262
Kill him.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.848
Wait.

04:33.565 --> 04:34.566
New plan.

04:42.199 --> 04:43.450
Bruce.

04:44.159 --> 04:47.997
This is so unexpected!

04:49.456 --> 04:50.666
You've looked better.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.376
I've been in hiding.

04:54.878 --> 04:56.422
They destroyed my lab, Bjayzl.

04:59.008 --> 05:00.426
Darling, I heard.

05:02.761 --> 05:03.887
Have some tranya.

05:14.398 --> 05:18.235
They used some kind of molecular solvent
to destroy the entire facility.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.612
There was literally nothing left.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.199
They nearly got me.

05:24.283 --> 05:25.367
I'm so sorry, Bjayzl.

05:25.451 --> 05:26.493
For what?

05:27.911 --> 05:30.414
I don't know how
I'm ever gonna repay your loan.

05:33.292 --> 05:34.835
Nonsense.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.047
Who do you think did this, Bruce? Hmm?

05:42.134 --> 05:43.677
Who's after you?

05:45.596 --> 05:47.556
I think it was the Tal Shiar.

05:50.559 --> 05:52.686
Well, that does change things a bit.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.748
Making a deal with the Tal Shiar is...

06:14.458 --> 06:16.418
always such a pain in the ass.

08:00.439 --> 08:02.441
Welcome to Freecloud.

08:02.524 --> 08:04.693
Whether you're here
for the maximum security,

08:04.776 --> 08:06.612
financial and information services,

08:06.695 --> 08:08.214
or the minimal restrictions
on personal liberty...

08:08.238 --> 08:09.238
Come.

08:09.781 --> 08:11.617
Freecloud keeps your secrets.

08:15.579 --> 08:16.580
You well?

08:17.831 --> 08:19.583
I'm functional.

08:20.167 --> 08:23.253
Something to drink? Tea, glass of wine?

08:23.337 --> 08:24.463
Bourbon. Straight up.

08:31.803 --> 08:33.639
This place is something.

08:36.767 --> 08:38.185
Not my idea.

08:38.560 --> 08:40.479
But you like it enough to keep it?

08:46.693 --> 08:48.695
What the hell are you
doing out here, Picard?

08:48.779 --> 08:50.781
Besides being in way over your head.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.282
I'm looking for someone.

08:53.951 --> 08:55.410
Does that surprise you?

08:55.494 --> 08:59.081
I assumed it must be some kind
of misguided, diplomatic mission.

08:59.164 --> 09:00.457
Saving the galaxy?

09:00.540 --> 09:02.626
There may be a bit of that too.

09:05.128 --> 09:06.168
You're going to Freecloud.

09:06.838 --> 09:08.090
You know Freecloud?

09:08.882 --> 09:10.008
I hate the place.

09:10.092 --> 09:12.636
But we, the Fenris Rangers,
keep our money there.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.388
What little of it there is.

09:14.680 --> 09:17.182
It's a tough time on Fenris, I hear.

09:19.351 --> 09:20.686
Does that make you happy?

09:23.897 --> 09:29.528
I admire the Rangers' goals,
their courage, their tenacity.

09:30.112 --> 09:34.825
But, you are taking the law
into your own hands.

09:34.908 --> 09:35.951
What law?

09:37.869 --> 09:38.996
Point taken.

09:39.621 --> 09:43.875
Nevertheless,
to appoint yourself judge and jury...

09:43.959 --> 09:45.460
I'm not here for a lecture.

09:45.877 --> 09:48.130
You think of me as a vigilante. Fine.

09:48.839 --> 09:50.424
Ranging is my job.

09:50.507 --> 09:52.092
It's not saving the galaxy,

09:52.175 --> 09:54.295
it's helping people who
have no one else to help them.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.347
It's hopeless and pointless
and exhausting,

09:57.431 --> 09:58.932
and the only thing worse...

10:00.267 --> 10:01.768
would be giving up.

10:02.311 --> 10:03.312
Hmm.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.608
Freecloud works. You could drop me there.

10:13.405 --> 10:14.489
Who are you looking for?

10:15.073 --> 10:17.701
Someone who has no one else to help her.

10:18.994 --> 10:22.414
Someone who will likely die, if I don't.

10:33.508 --> 10:35.010
Then I'll take another one of these.

10:45.854 --> 10:47.189
She's in there with him.

10:47.272 --> 10:48.148
Huh?

10:48.231 --> 10:50.359
The ranger.
She's in the chÃ¢teau with Picard.

10:50.442 --> 10:53.445
Ooh. What do those two
have to talk about, I wonder?

10:53.528 --> 10:55.113
Seems like they know each other...

10:55.197 --> 10:56.531
No. I don't think so.

10:56.907 --> 10:58.367
Not back when I knew him anyway.

10:58.867 --> 11:02.245
You know,
she used to be a Borg, like him.

11:03.121 --> 11:05.207
- Oh, wow.
- Mm-hmm.

11:05.290 --> 11:06.458
She's that Ranger.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.378
She's notorious.

11:09.961 --> 11:12.255
- Ninety-nine or Eleven or...
- Mm.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.382
Uh-uh.

11:15.717 --> 11:16.718
She goes by Seven.

11:17.094 --> 11:18.470
- Seven.
- Mm-hmm.

11:18.970 --> 11:21.098
The ex-Borg Fenris Ranger.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.475
I heard she's from the Delta Quadrant.

11:24.935 --> 11:28.939
Seven, the ex-Borg Fenris Ranger
from the Delta Quadrant.

11:31.775 --> 11:34.569
And I somehow managed to forget
that Picard used to be Borg too.

11:34.653 --> 11:36.321
Must've happily blocked it out.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.787
This is some strange cargo
you brought me this time, Raffi.

11:44.788 --> 11:45.914
Tell me about it.

11:49.084 --> 11:52.504
Okay.
Okay, I don't get it.

11:53.046 --> 12:00.011
You replicated the flour,
the butter, the eggs, the sugar

12:00.095 --> 12:01.763
and the chocolate chips.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.723
Yes. And the baking soda.

12:03.807 --> 12:05.934
Oh, so... Yes. Baking soda, right.

12:06.017 --> 12:08.520
And then you've set them all on fire.

12:08.603 --> 12:11.022
I do not set them on fire.

12:11.106 --> 12:13.275
I bake them in my oven.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.026
- Oh.
- Ow, it's still warm.

12:16.653 --> 12:19.531
Why don't you just replicate the cookies?

12:19.614 --> 12:22.742
Because I do not like
the replicator's chocolate chip cookies.

12:23.326 --> 12:24.911
What can I say? There's an alchemy.

12:24.995 --> 12:25.996
Come here, Aggie.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.581
Taste it.

12:48.393 --> 12:50.896
La Sirena,
this is Freecloud Orbital Control,

12:50.979 --> 12:52.939
confirming transfer of conn.

12:53.023 --> 12:54.023
Roger that.

12:54.691 --> 12:55.942
Welcome, Captain Rios.

12:56.026 --> 12:59.321
I see your power conversion efficiency
is only 91%.

12:59.404 --> 13:02.574
Remember, nobody knows their way
around the Kaplan F17 Speed Freighter

13:02.657 --> 13:04.284
like the Red Bolian. Ah!

13:04.910 --> 13:05.911
Care for a cuppa?

13:05.994 --> 13:08.997
Join the party at the Freecloud
Grand Hotel's afternoon high tea.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.081
No.

13:10.165 --> 13:11.917
No! God, make it go away.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.544
The Freecloud
Institute of Entertainment Robotics

13:14.628 --> 13:16.308
is now hiring kinetic feedback architects.

13:16.338 --> 13:17.589
You have to punch it.

13:17.672 --> 13:18.673
Wha... What?

13:18.757 --> 13:19.925
Hit it as hard as you can.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.134
I don't hit things.

13:21.218 --> 13:22.511
Oh, no, he's right, Doc.

13:22.594 --> 13:24.596
You need to knock his head clear off.

13:30.977 --> 13:33.438
Agnes for the knockout.

13:36.608 --> 13:38.944
Hey, lady. You looking to get snake bit?

13:39.027 --> 13:42.113
Slither into Feely's Venom Garden
and pick your poison.

13:45.408 --> 13:46.701
I didn't get one.

13:47.536 --> 13:49.663
Uh, I found him, JL.

13:50.705 --> 13:51.706
You found Maddox?

13:52.290 --> 13:54.501
Yes, but, my goodness.

13:54.584 --> 13:56.670
Bruce Maddox, what did you do?

13:57.212 --> 13:59.214
I'm on a jobs board for interfacers.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.132
Essentially go-betweens for hire.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.635
Big business for competing corporations.

14:04.010 --> 14:07.055
Rival criminal gangs,
thieves and their victims,

14:07.138 --> 14:08.765
especially on Freecloud.

14:09.474 --> 14:13.562
I just sent myself an invitation
to join the local 'facer's guild.

14:13.645 --> 14:15.605
Old Starfleet intel trick.

14:15.689 --> 14:16.690
Yeah.

14:16.773 --> 14:17.774
Okay.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.735
Party named Bjayzl is holding him.

14:20.819 --> 14:23.405
They're looking for someone
to broker a deal with the...

14:24.406 --> 14:25.657
Tal Shiar.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.200
Bjayzl?

14:28.785 --> 14:29.786
You know him?

14:31.454 --> 14:32.455
Her.

14:32.539 --> 14:35.292
She butchers ex-Borg for parts.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.836
She's been high on the Rangers'
wanted list for years.

14:38.712 --> 14:40.297
Couldn't we outbid the Tal Shiar?

14:40.380 --> 14:41.798
No. Not likely.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.508
She's prudent enough to use a 'facer,

14:43.592 --> 14:45.510
this is probably
a pretty substantial deal.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.804
We must extract him.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.348
Uh, not with the security she's got.

14:50.432 --> 14:54.811
Occluded payroll shows she's got
a little army of private contractors.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.063
And a Beta Annari.

14:57.897 --> 14:58.940
What's a Beta Annari?

14:59.024 --> 15:00.191
Sentient reptiloid.

15:00.275 --> 15:01.985
Nasty pieces of work.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.904
Without Maddox,
we'll never find Dahj's sister.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.448
Options?

15:06.531 --> 15:08.531
Well, if we can't grab him,
and we can't buy him...

15:08.575 --> 15:10.076
Then we're shit outta luck, JL.

15:10.160 --> 15:11.160
Not quite.

15:11.536 --> 15:12.621
We trade.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.957
Give Bjayzl something she wants
in exchange for Maddox.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.376
Something she'll find irresistible.

15:19.919 --> 15:20.920
Like what?

15:21.338 --> 15:22.547
Like me.

15:53.036 --> 15:56.790
Okay. I dropped a pretty
foolproof idea to get into the system.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.875
You are now a 'facer.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.543
Famous, but not too famous.

16:00.627 --> 16:01.628
"Pretty foolproof"?

16:01.711 --> 16:03.880
We're not working
with a whole lot of time here.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.215
Raffi, are you serious,

16:05.298 --> 16:07.300
sending us down there looking like this?

16:07.384 --> 16:10.470
Well, 'facers tend to dress
very flamboyant, JL.

16:10.553 --> 16:12.222
It's protective coloration.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.556
You're playing go-between.

16:13.640 --> 16:14.641
You wanna stand out.

16:14.724 --> 16:16.935
You don't want anyone
mixing you up with the other side.

16:18.311 --> 16:19.604
What do you think, Agnes?

16:19.979 --> 16:21.147
I think you're killing it.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.276
But are you really a 'facer?

16:25.652 --> 16:26.820
No.

16:27.362 --> 16:29.614
You're licensed,
paid up on your guild dues.

16:29.698 --> 16:32.242
- You have a meeting with Mr. Vup.
- Mr. Vup.

16:32.325 --> 16:36.663
Yeah. Rios, you seriously,
really need to sell this.

16:36.746 --> 16:40.792
You can't do your broody,
existentialist, spaceman routine.

16:40.875 --> 16:43.795
Your personality
needs to match your clothes.

16:43.878 --> 16:45.797
You need to show a little panache.

16:45.880 --> 16:47.632
You need a feather in your hat.

17:12.866 --> 17:15.368
A Temtibi Lagoon,
if it's not too much bother,

17:15.702 --> 17:16.703
and a game tablet.

17:19.456 --> 17:20.707
With two umbrellas.

17:22.459 --> 17:26.045
And if you can please
let Mr. Vup know that I'm here.

17:29.674 --> 17:31.009
The name is Rios.

17:31.968 --> 17:33.136
Mr. Vup knows.

17:33.219 --> 17:35.847
Feeling lucky, Mr. Rios?

17:36.681 --> 17:38.475
And try to stay away
from the lizard.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.978
Beta Annari can smell
when you're not telling the truth.

17:42.061 --> 17:42.937
Seriously?

17:43.021 --> 17:46.024
And also what you had for dinner
and the last person you had sex with.

17:46.107 --> 17:47.525
If they're not the same thing.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.652
Because that's not disturbing.

17:50.278 --> 17:51.362
I'm Mr. Vup.

17:51.696 --> 17:54.616
Of course you are. Salutations.

17:55.116 --> 17:56.117
Please.

17:57.994 --> 17:59.913
Let us not waste time.

17:59.996 --> 18:02.290
Your references are sound.

18:02.373 --> 18:05.084
Mr. Quark of Ferenginar
was especially satisfied

18:05.168 --> 18:07.128
with your handling
of his trouble with the Breen.

18:07.212 --> 18:09.714
Yes, that was quite a foofaraw.

18:11.216 --> 18:14.928
Are you aware of the identity of
the other party in this negotiation?

18:15.011 --> 18:16.012
Indeed.

18:16.095 --> 18:19.182
Have you had dealings
with the Tal Shiar before?

18:19.265 --> 18:22.644
To be honest,
I've tried hard to stay out of their way.

18:23.144 --> 18:26.523
They are treacherous,
violent, ruthless and subtle.

18:26.606 --> 18:30.860
Their concept of honor
is rooted in their skill at deceit.

18:30.944 --> 18:33.905
So, why represent them now?

18:33.988 --> 18:35.573
Oh!

18:35.657 --> 18:36.783
I'm not.

18:39.035 --> 18:41.246
I'm here on behalf
of another interested party.

18:42.330 --> 18:44.082
I've come to offer your employer

18:44.165 --> 18:46.960
alternative remuneration
for Doctor Maddox.

18:47.043 --> 18:48.920
Surprising.

18:51.089 --> 18:53.550
I'm not a fan of surprises.

18:53.633 --> 18:54.968
I'm getting that sense.

18:55.051 --> 18:57.554
Now what could possibly
be worth reneging on a deal

18:57.637 --> 18:59.597
with the Romulan Secret Police?

18:59.681 --> 19:00.932
I can explain.

19:01.015 --> 19:03.351
Maybe you aren't aware, Mr. Rios.

19:03.893 --> 19:08.022
We Beta Annari
have 1253 olfactory receptor genes.

19:08.106 --> 19:10.608
Which means, among other things,

19:11.401 --> 19:13.444
I can smell a lie.

19:14.195 --> 19:17.991
So, Mr. Rios, proceed with caution.

19:18.074 --> 19:19.075
Ay!

19:19.158 --> 19:20.785
- Sorry.
- What the hell?

19:20.869 --> 19:23.413
Beta blockers, anxiolytics, benzos.

19:23.496 --> 19:26.291
Delayed release.
Raffi's home cooking, honey.

19:26.374 --> 19:27.375
Why would you do that?

19:27.458 --> 19:30.920
Just in case you do run into
one of those hypersensitive reptiloids.

19:31.004 --> 19:33.256
Should kick in right about
when you need it.

19:41.764 --> 19:44.517
That many implants
in a living specimen.

19:44.601 --> 19:45.727
Impossible.

19:47.937 --> 19:49.272
How do I smell?

19:52.066 --> 19:53.318
Truthful.

19:55.403 --> 19:59.699
You also had some sort of smoked meat
for breakfast, didn't you?

20:00.700 --> 20:04.871
So many intact and functioning
Borg parts in a single specimen.

20:05.622 --> 20:07.707
She would be extremely valuable.

20:07.790 --> 20:13.087
If you will indulge me
with the smallest of transporter windows.

20:14.672 --> 20:18.092
Honestly, Rios isn't the one
I'm really worried about here.

20:18.176 --> 20:19.802
I'm more concerned with you two.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.722
Oh! I thought that I looked

20:23.306 --> 20:26.559
appropriately sinister.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.519
No comment.

20:28.603 --> 20:32.273
Assuming Rios doesn't choke
or mess everything up somehow.

20:32.357 --> 20:33.358
Which he will not.

20:33.441 --> 20:35.610
This is a transport pattern enhancer.

20:35.693 --> 20:37.320
Once you get it inside their shields,

20:37.403 --> 20:39.906
it will create a stable tunnel
to transport in and out of.

20:39.989 --> 20:43.201
They won't be able to differentiate it
from your implants on the scan.

20:43.284 --> 20:46.371
Um, hands, please. No offense.

20:46.454 --> 20:47.622
None taken.

20:49.082 --> 20:51.751
Why... are you helping them, I mean?

20:54.462 --> 20:57.423
Evacuation ended
and the Neutral Zone collapsed.

20:57.507 --> 20:59.550
Someone needed to maintain
a semblance of order.

20:59.634 --> 21:02.804
I suppose at this point it's become habit.

21:04.097 --> 21:07.141
I admire what you do out there
with the Rangers.

21:08.518 --> 21:10.353
- Push in and then pull out to...
- Yes.

21:10.436 --> 21:13.106
Okay, once you get Maddox,

21:13.189 --> 21:15.817
activate the enhancer,
and the doc here will beam you out.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.068
Wait, wait, wait.

21:17.151 --> 21:19.631
- Hello. Hold on a second.
- I just... Wait. Hold that thought.

21:22.365 --> 21:23.491
- Can you breathe?
- Yes.

21:23.574 --> 21:25.410
What do you mean I beam them out?

21:25.493 --> 21:26.493
It's a lie.

21:28.371 --> 21:30.665
Everybody's behaving
as if they were somebody else.

21:35.837 --> 21:37.005
Everyone except me.

21:39.215 --> 21:40.216
He's clear.

21:43.011 --> 21:45.179
And, Agnes,
you're on transporter duty.

21:45.263 --> 21:46.389
Really? Me?

21:47.056 --> 21:49.726
Okay. How hard is it, really?

21:50.852 --> 21:51.853
Piece of cake.

21:53.021 --> 21:54.897
Aguardiente.

21:56.149 --> 21:57.400
Ay...

21:57.483 --> 21:58.484
Oh, man.

21:59.902 --> 22:01.654
I don't know how to not be Elnor.

22:02.238 --> 22:04.032
Then be Elnor.

22:04.115 --> 22:05.950
An Elnor who never talks.

22:08.953 --> 22:11.497
Disgusting thing.

22:11.581 --> 22:14.625
Once they get the Borg inside them,
there is no coming back.

22:14.709 --> 22:16.085
No matter what they think.

22:16.169 --> 22:19.464
Defiled is what you are. Damned! Cursed.

22:19.547 --> 22:20.882
Quite a prize.

22:20.965 --> 22:24.427
Rare to find one with so many implants
still fully operational.

22:24.510 --> 22:26.679
She is not one of the new ones.

22:27.388 --> 22:31.726
When the Borg entered her,
she was a jeune fille.

22:31.809 --> 22:35.396
You are going to have to dice her up
to get it all out.

22:37.565 --> 22:39.609
A little squeamish, are we?

22:39.692 --> 22:41.903
I can take my trade elsewhere.

22:41.986 --> 22:46.741
No. Not squeamish. Not at all.

22:47.241 --> 22:48.451
Your work is done.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.165
Mind if I have another drink?

22:54.248 --> 22:55.708
It's a free planet.

22:56.250 --> 22:58.503
Let's see if there's a deal to be made.

22:58.586 --> 23:01.631
Now that's the kind of talk that I like.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.299
But one last thing.

23:03.382 --> 23:08.221
I need proof that my bounty is alive.

23:08.721 --> 23:11.265
I need to see Maddox!

23:19.232 --> 23:23.194
Gabriel Hwang
located. Stardust City medical district.

23:29.367 --> 23:31.285
Make sure
the kid sticks to the script.

23:31.828 --> 23:32.995
And watch your back.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.041
Admiral Picard.

23:38.126 --> 23:39.335
Time to go.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.463
You've got this.

23:42.547 --> 23:45.800
This is going to be
very much harder without you.

23:45.883 --> 23:48.553
It was almost like the old days
for a minute there, huh?

23:50.763 --> 23:51.764
I...

23:57.019 --> 23:59.021
I hope you find
what you came out here for.

23:59.105 --> 24:01.941
And I sincerely wish the same for you.

24:04.735 --> 24:05.736
Do it.

24:17.582 --> 24:19.333
Don't get lost in the crowd.

24:19.417 --> 24:21.294
At Freecloud Family Planning,

24:21.377 --> 24:23.379
your baby is our baby.

24:23.462 --> 24:24.964
Join our family today.

24:30.720 --> 24:34.015
Please report to
Parthenogenetic Implant Lab Three

24:34.098 --> 24:35.308
for your next procedure.

24:36.684 --> 24:39.228
Please report to
Parthenogenetic Implant Lab Three

24:39.312 --> 24:40.646
for your next procedure.

24:43.065 --> 24:44.066
Hello.

24:52.450 --> 24:53.451
Wow.

24:54.285 --> 24:55.786
Here?

25:07.340 --> 25:11.219
So what, you put a tracker in me,
or just... hunt me down?

25:11.302 --> 25:13.804
Oh. I still hear things.

25:13.888 --> 25:15.681
Maybe I
hunted you down a little.

25:19.227 --> 25:20.811
You just kinda crossed my path.

25:20.895 --> 25:21.979
Path to where?

25:23.022 --> 25:24.023
To Freecloud.

25:27.151 --> 25:28.152
To you.

25:29.654 --> 25:32.490
Gabe... I'm clean.

25:35.451 --> 25:37.662
I feel good.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.457
I was not there for you.

25:43.251 --> 25:45.731
- Even when I was there, I wasn't there.
- No, especially then.

25:45.795 --> 25:47.546
Wait, but I'm here now.

25:48.923 --> 25:50.091
If you'll let me be.

25:52.051 --> 25:53.052
For you.

25:53.761 --> 25:55.179
And for my little gran...

25:57.723 --> 25:59.433
She's a girl.

26:01.310 --> 26:02.520
You know there was a time

26:02.603 --> 26:05.022
when it would've meant the world
to me to hear you say that.

26:05.106 --> 26:08.109
- Oh, Gabriel, hon...
- So what, you're changed?

26:08.192 --> 26:09.902
Yeah, you're different now.

26:09.986 --> 26:12.863
Yes. I'm making a start, Gabe.

26:13.739 --> 26:16.117
I'm putting my life back together.

26:16.575 --> 26:19.245
That's why I came
all the way out here for you.

26:19.328 --> 26:22.957
So, um, the attack on Mars.

26:23.916 --> 26:26.168
- Tell me how it wasn't really the synths.
- Uh, honey...

26:26.252 --> 26:28.296
Tell me about the Conclave of Eight.

26:28.379 --> 26:30.965
Tell me what was worth
ignoring me and Dad,

26:31.048 --> 26:32.758
until we hardly recognized you.

26:32.842 --> 26:33.843
I didn't.

26:33.926 --> 26:36.470
Why you abandoned us
for some crackpot tin hat conspir...

26:36.554 --> 26:37.930
No. It wasn't crackpot!

26:38.723 --> 26:40.433
That attack was not what it seemed!

26:42.018 --> 26:44.103
Baby, there is a conspiracy,

26:44.186 --> 26:46.856
and it is bigger than anybody knew.
There were lives at stake...

26:46.939 --> 26:48.065
Our lives, Mom.

26:49.233 --> 26:52.403
Our lives mattered too. Just not to you.

26:55.531 --> 26:58.743
I don't think you understand just
how much it sucked to be your kid.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.085
Hey, Pel, baby, um,

27:08.627 --> 27:10.838
this is my mother, Raffaela.

27:11.213 --> 27:14.550
She was just passing through,
I guess. She had a second.

27:15.051 --> 27:17.136
Hello, it's wonderful to meet you.

27:17.595 --> 27:19.013
- Will you be staying a while?
- No.

27:19.096 --> 27:21.682
Like I said, she's just passing by.

27:26.479 --> 27:28.731
It's so nice to meet you.

27:32.234 --> 27:33.569
Good luck with the baby.

27:40.534 --> 27:41.577
Goodbye, Gabe.

27:42.495 --> 27:43.496
Bye, Mom.

28:03.808 --> 28:04.642
Show me.

28:04.725 --> 28:07.269
As I was telling your Mr. Vip...

28:07.353 --> 28:08.270
Vup.

28:08.354 --> 28:12.858
You will not see many more like her!

28:14.151 --> 28:16.612
When they get assimilated as kids,

28:16.695 --> 28:20.449
more of the hardware remains inside them.

28:20.533 --> 28:25.579
Ears, eyes, neck,
chest, spine, kidneys, hips.

28:25.663 --> 28:27.415
Various bones.

28:27.498 --> 28:29.375
I thought it could be you.

28:29.959 --> 28:32.461
"Hoped" might even be the word.

28:34.880 --> 28:39.593
I always knew you were impressive,
but I just never knew how impressive.

28:40.970 --> 28:43.806
And it's good to see you again, Annika.

28:55.109 --> 28:58.529
You'll be okay. You can do this.

28:58.612 --> 29:00.614
You have to do this.

29:01.574 --> 29:02.574
Oh, God.

29:03.701 --> 29:06.036
What is the nature
of your psychiatric emergency?

29:06.662 --> 29:08.598
Your pulse and blood pressure
are significantly elevated.

29:08.622 --> 29:10.374
Because you scared
the hell out of me.

29:10.458 --> 29:13.711
- I'd like to give you a sedative.
- I don't need a s...

29:13.794 --> 29:14.628
Agnes, you copy?

29:14.712 --> 29:17.214
- Are you certain you really...
- Yes, I am certain!

29:17.298 --> 29:18.299
Agnes.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.342
Yes, hi.

29:20.718 --> 29:21.718
Who you talking to?

29:22.219 --> 29:25.139
You. But not you-you. No one.

29:25.222 --> 29:27.725
- Captain, Doctor Jurati's experiencing...
- Deactivate EMH.

29:33.189 --> 29:34.315
I'm here.

29:34.398 --> 29:36.734
The operative
terms are "copy that" and "go ahead."

29:36.817 --> 29:39.528
Something's not right,
we may have to abort.

29:40.196 --> 29:41.405
Do you have a lock on them?

29:42.031 --> 29:43.115
Uh, yes.

29:43.199 --> 29:45.951
Um, affirmative, it's showing red.

29:46.035 --> 29:47.995
They haven't activated
the pattern enhancer yet.

29:48.078 --> 29:50.289
Let me know the instant they do.

29:50.372 --> 29:53.459
Yes. Copy. Affirmative, um, whatever.

29:53.542 --> 29:55.920
What's going on down there?

29:56.670 --> 30:01.008
Are you still angry because
I carved up your little friend for parts?

30:01.884 --> 30:03.636
Or is it because you trusted me?

30:04.637 --> 30:06.347
You were so noble then.

30:07.431 --> 30:08.807
Save the outcast.

30:10.017 --> 30:11.727
Rescue the forgotten.

30:14.563 --> 30:15.898
You were so easy.

30:16.357 --> 30:17.358
Was I, Jay?

30:18.234 --> 30:19.360
Then how did I get away?

30:20.569 --> 30:22.947
How did I escape the great Bjayzl?

30:23.697 --> 30:26.992
A fortune in Borg tech and you lost it.

30:29.078 --> 30:30.079
You lost me.

30:31.413 --> 30:35.376
No one's ever been worth more
to you than me.

30:35.459 --> 30:38.712
And I slipped right through your fingers.

30:40.297 --> 30:41.966
I'm the one that got away.

30:46.929 --> 30:47.930
Not anymore.

30:49.431 --> 30:50.432
Wrong, Jay.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.727
Drop your weapons.

30:53.811 --> 30:55.604
Listen to her. Now!

31:04.905 --> 31:06.991
What the hell is going on here?

31:07.366 --> 31:10.119
I was not entirely candid with you.

31:10.536 --> 31:11.620
Really?

31:13.497 --> 31:14.790
Are we still pretending?

31:15.374 --> 31:16.375
No, Elnor.

31:18.002 --> 31:21.380
I think everyone has finally stopped.

31:30.347 --> 31:33.183
Bruce. How are you doing?

31:35.894 --> 31:36.895
Picard.

31:37.938 --> 31:42.818
Picard? The famous Admiral Picard?

31:43.402 --> 31:47.072
Well, it appears you thought
you were playing

31:47.156 --> 31:50.200
when you were being played, Admiral.

31:51.160 --> 31:53.412
I take it you had no awareness

31:53.495 --> 31:57.124
of Annika and my close,
personal relationsh...

31:57.207 --> 31:59.293
Shut up.

32:01.170 --> 32:02.171
Take Maddox and go.

32:02.504 --> 32:03.505
What do you mean?

32:03.756 --> 32:04.882
She means to kill me.

32:05.299 --> 32:10.554
But, hero to the end, our Annika,
she will first save your lives.

32:10.638 --> 32:11.638
Just go.

32:13.474 --> 32:15.184
You know, you were right.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.227
This is not saving the galaxy.

32:17.311 --> 32:19.897
This is just settling an old score.

32:19.980 --> 32:21.482
You have no idea what this is.

32:21.565 --> 32:23.692
Well, tell me. What is it?

32:28.530 --> 32:29.865
When the rescues ended,

32:29.948 --> 32:34.203
some of us tried to help maintain order
on the worlds the Federation left behind.

32:35.496 --> 32:36.955
We were based on Fenris.

32:37.665 --> 32:40.709
One of us was a young science officer
on leave from the USS Coleman.

32:41.627 --> 32:45.673
He was out doing recon near Daimanta
when his ship received a distress call.

32:47.758 --> 32:49.385
It turned out to be an ambush.

32:51.887 --> 32:54.556
He was the closest thing
I will ever have to kin.

32:55.391 --> 32:57.559
Like me, Icheb was a former Borg

32:57.643 --> 33:00.354
rescued and reclaimed by Voyager
in the Delta Quadrant.

33:00.437 --> 33:01.814
That's why she wanted him.

33:02.356 --> 33:03.399
His parts were...

33:06.276 --> 33:07.403
good business.

33:08.570 --> 33:11.073
Bjayzl had his implants stripped out...

33:12.282 --> 33:13.659
without anesthetic.

33:15.619 --> 33:17.871
Without even the minor mercy of death.

33:22.710 --> 33:23.711
I'd met her on Fenris.

33:23.794 --> 33:27.631
She was posing as one of us,
as someone trying to help.

33:31.301 --> 33:33.011
She knew about Icheb from me.

33:35.848 --> 33:39.643
But murder is not justice.

33:40.352 --> 33:43.063
There is no solace in revenge.

33:43.147 --> 33:46.942
You have had your humanity
restored to you.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.569
Don't squander it now.

33:53.073 --> 33:55.159
- You guys ready to go yet?
- Take them.

33:56.660 --> 33:59.180
Activate the pattern enhancer
and get them the hell out of here.

33:59.329 --> 34:00.330
You got it.

34:02.708 --> 34:05.586
Revenge. I understand the impulse.

34:06.837 --> 34:08.922
But you do this,
you put a bounty on all of us.

34:09.006 --> 34:10.007
I don't give a damn.

34:10.090 --> 34:11.633
But the kid and the old man,

34:11.717 --> 34:14.636
they don't stand a chance out here
with a price on their heads.

34:14.720 --> 34:16.180
Your friend has a point, Annika.

34:17.264 --> 34:18.265
Let's make a trade.

34:20.309 --> 34:21.393
Maddox for my life.

34:22.811 --> 34:23.854
Hey.

34:23.937 --> 34:26.023
Look at the math of it, is all I'm saying.

34:27.441 --> 34:31.445
You found her once.
Odds are you'll do it again.

34:38.994 --> 34:40.579
Five to beam up, Doctor.

34:41.163 --> 34:42.164
Come on.

34:47.961 --> 34:48.962
I did it.

34:51.715 --> 34:52.841
Oh, my God. Bruce.

34:53.592 --> 34:54.593
He's in bad shape.

34:54.676 --> 34:56.261
Exposure. Dehydration.

34:56.345 --> 34:57.513
Maybe other things.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.431
Best to get him to sickbay quickly.

34:59.515 --> 35:00.599
I'll take care of him.

35:00.682 --> 35:01.683
Aggie.

35:02.434 --> 35:03.268
Aggie.

35:03.352 --> 35:04.353
Captain Rios.

35:04.436 --> 35:06.313
Getting us the hell out of here, sir.

35:10.943 --> 35:12.528
I'm glad with the choice you made.

35:13.070 --> 35:16.198
It seems that a lift
is the least I can offer you.

35:17.366 --> 35:20.452
The Rangers already sent a corsair for me.
It should be here by now.

35:20.536 --> 35:21.912
Ah.

35:21.995 --> 35:24.248
But I will take two of your phasers,
if that's all right?

35:24.998 --> 35:26.917
A vigilante could always
use a couple more.

35:29.294 --> 35:30.295
Of course.

35:31.922 --> 35:36.009
And in case you ever need a vigilante.

35:39.680 --> 35:40.722
Thank you.

35:59.950 --> 36:02.619
After they brought you back
from your time in the Collective...

36:04.454 --> 36:08.083
do you honestly feel
that you regained your humanity?

36:09.376 --> 36:10.377
Yes.

36:11.587 --> 36:12.588
All of it?

36:16.133 --> 36:17.509
No.

36:18.927 --> 36:23.765
But we're both working on it, aren't we?

36:26.643 --> 36:28.228
Every damned day of my life.

36:39.406 --> 36:40.407
Hi.

36:54.755 --> 36:56.006
Well...

36:56.882 --> 36:58.634
Frankly, I was surprised when you left.

36:58.717 --> 37:01.345
I thought you'd bet on
shooting your way out.

37:01.428 --> 37:02.428
I am.

37:02.888 --> 37:05.140
How sentimental of you then.

37:07.059 --> 37:10.062
Risking your revenge...

37:11.355 --> 37:12.773
while saving their lives.

37:13.982 --> 37:15.859
Almost reminds me of...

37:18.737 --> 37:20.364
the Annika of old.

37:21.448 --> 37:22.449
Me too.

37:24.493 --> 37:27.704
Picard still thinks
there's a place in the galaxy for mercy.

37:28.747 --> 37:30.582
I didn't want to disillusion him.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.086
Somebody out here
ought to have a little hope.

37:35.504 --> 37:36.922
Like you used to have?

37:38.006 --> 37:39.758
Before I took it away from you.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.636
Something like that.

37:44.262 --> 37:45.555
You're stalling, Jay.

37:46.640 --> 37:49.601
Your second security wave
will be here in less than five seconds.

37:50.352 --> 37:51.353
Annika.

37:53.647 --> 37:55.315
He was a son to me, Jay.

37:57.192 --> 37:58.360
This is for him.

38:02.990 --> 38:05.283
- Punch it down!
- Bjayzl!

38:23.218 --> 38:24.970
Massive abdominal hemorrhaging.

38:25.053 --> 38:27.597
Increase clotting factor by 12%.

38:28.098 --> 38:29.933
They really worked you over.

38:32.936 --> 38:37.774
Dahj is dead... isn't she?

38:40.569 --> 38:41.820
She found me.

38:43.697 --> 38:45.282
And then I lost her.

38:47.034 --> 38:48.702
I'm profoundly sorry.

38:51.413 --> 38:53.915
When the Tal Shiar came for me...

38:55.375 --> 38:56.626
blew up my lab...

38:57.669 --> 38:58.670
I knew.

39:00.797 --> 39:03.967
Her embedded Mom AI
wouldn't have activated her

39:04.051 --> 39:06.386
unless she was in grave danger.

39:07.554 --> 39:10.390
Bruce. Bruce.

39:11.224 --> 39:12.476
I have to know.

39:13.351 --> 39:15.395
Does she have a sister?

39:16.813 --> 39:17.814
Yes.

39:18.482 --> 39:20.442
Soji.

39:20.942 --> 39:23.361
Soji. Where is she?

39:30.494 --> 39:32.245
She, she's on the Artifact.

39:33.622 --> 39:34.873
The Artifact?

39:35.624 --> 39:36.708
You mean...

39:38.210 --> 39:40.212
Not the captured Borg cube?

39:44.174 --> 39:45.300
Why?

39:46.968 --> 39:49.846
Same reason I sent her sister to Earth...

39:51.848 --> 39:53.517
To find the truth.

39:54.017 --> 39:55.310
The truth about what?

39:58.021 --> 39:59.022
The ban.

40:01.233 --> 40:03.360
There are lies upon lies.

40:04.402 --> 40:05.654
They're hiding something.

40:06.738 --> 40:07.864
Who?

40:07.948 --> 40:08.949
I don't know.

40:09.950 --> 40:11.868
The same ones who are hunting her.

40:12.244 --> 40:13.286
The Romulans?

40:14.329 --> 40:15.497
Not just them.

40:16.790 --> 40:19.292
I think the Federation
are involved.

40:21.044 --> 40:23.505
That's what I sent them to find out.

40:28.301 --> 40:30.262
Admiral, he's barely stable.

40:30.929 --> 40:32.514
He needs to rest.

40:32.597 --> 40:33.598
Understood.

40:36.059 --> 40:37.144
I'll leave you to it.

40:45.735 --> 40:48.989
The Artifact? That's in Romulan space.

40:49.072 --> 40:50.240
Mm-hmm.

40:50.323 --> 40:52.367
Flying into Romulan space doubles my fee.

40:56.121 --> 40:57.122
Okay, jefe.

40:58.206 --> 41:00.125
"Old man," indeed.

41:03.170 --> 41:08.049
So... are we gonna talk
about our stowaway?

41:14.347 --> 41:15.348
Raffi?

41:16.600 --> 41:17.684
Leave me alone.

41:21.646 --> 41:22.647
Welcome back.

41:34.743 --> 41:35.869
Aggie.

41:39.831 --> 41:41.666
I thought I was dreaming.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.501
It's me.

41:46.129 --> 41:47.672
I never thought I'd see you again.

41:52.886 --> 41:53.970
Did you...

41:55.305 --> 41:56.598
Did you see her?

41:58.975 --> 42:00.769
Did you get to meet Dahj?

42:04.356 --> 42:05.357
No.

42:09.277 --> 42:11.112
They're perfect.

42:12.656 --> 42:15.575
Perfectly imperfect.

42:19.204 --> 42:20.330
We did it, Aggie.

42:22.707 --> 42:24.209
Soong and I.

42:26.878 --> 42:27.879
And you.

42:30.465 --> 42:35.053
Your contribution was essential.

42:40.850 --> 42:42.769
One more thing I have to atone for.

42:43.728 --> 42:44.771
What do you mean?

42:49.776 --> 42:52.028
What is the nature
of your psychiatric emergency?

42:53.655 --> 42:55.448
Your blood pressure and cortisol levels...

42:58.285 --> 43:00.203
What is the nature
of your medical emergency?

43:00.745 --> 43:02.505
There's a high risk
of critical organ failure

43:02.539 --> 43:04.459
unless hematic micro-repair treatment
is resumed.

43:04.541 --> 43:05.834
Deactivate EMH.

43:12.549 --> 43:13.550
Aggie!

43:14.759 --> 43:16.469
I wish you knew what I know.

43:18.680 --> 43:20.473
I wish I didn't know what I know.

43:20.557 --> 43:22.350
I wish they hadn't shown me.

43:22.434 --> 43:24.477
I'm so sorry.
