WEBVTT

02:44.709 --> 02:45.876
I am retiring tomorrow.

02:47.084 --> 02:51.251
Since the past few weeks,
many people have asked me…

02:51.334 --> 02:55.417
… that Mr. Prakash Rathod,
commissioner of police Mumbai…

02:55.501 --> 03:00.542
… which was the most challenging
and interesting case of your life.

03:01.959 --> 03:03.292
I ignored this question.

03:04.542 --> 03:09.334
Every time… but every time
I remembered only one case.

03:10.001 --> 03:13.626
This case is not registered
in any file anywhere.

03:14.167 --> 03:19.376
There is no record anywhere.
But it is in my mind…

03:19.459 --> 03:25.001
… and some people who were involved
in this case unwillingly…

03:26.334 --> 03:27.459
That bastard.

03:28.667 --> 03:32.917
That bastard had the guts to just walk
into our lives and blow it apart.

03:33.834 --> 03:35.667
It was a Wednesday.

06:19.376 --> 06:21.084
Hello! Where are you going?

06:21.501 --> 06:22.709
To file an FIR.

06:23.167 --> 06:24.542
To the right. Room number three.

06:28.501 --> 06:32.876
Who hit you?
- My wife.

06:32.917 --> 06:34.542
I wanted to file an FIR.

06:34.751 --> 06:36.542
So what is there to be embarrassed
about? - Actually… - Go there.

06:38.626 --> 06:40.709
How?
- With a cooker.

06:44.584 --> 06:45.709
I want to file a complaint.

06:45.917 --> 06:48.876
Wait for a while. I will
call you. Have a seat.

06:52.001 --> 06:53.126
Why did she hit you?

06:53.584 --> 06:56.292
The problem was… that…

06:56.417 --> 06:59.001
Come on. Speak up. There
are other people waiting.

06:59.084 --> 07:01.292
I just told her that there
was more salt in the food.

07:01.542 --> 07:03.042
She just flared up.

07:03.626 --> 07:05.709
There was a cooker to her right.

07:05.792 --> 07:07.792
She picked it and hit
me on my left side.

07:08.751 --> 07:14.042
Sir please… just warn her once.
She keeps hitting me.

07:15.084 --> 07:17.251
You should never ever say
such things to your wife.

07:18.001 --> 07:20.292
Go home and say sorry.

07:20.584 --> 07:23.167
Or else instead of salt she will
put something else in your food.

07:23.251 --> 07:24.751
Did you understand?

07:25.459 --> 07:26.876
Don't take it too seriously. Go on.

07:26.959 --> 07:28.709
Sir, but file a report at least…
- Get lost!

07:34.292 --> 07:38.834
Hey mister, hello…
Mr. Jammu Kashmir, please come.

07:48.292 --> 07:51.042
What happened?
- I lost my wallet.

07:51.959 --> 07:57.042
How? What do you mean by how?
How do things get lost?

07:57.542 --> 08:00.667
I mean, where was it lost?
- I don't remember.

08:00.751 --> 08:02.417
When I checked, it wasn't with me.

08:04.042 --> 08:05.167
What were its contents?

08:05.376 --> 08:09.792
A photograph of my wife, driving
license. PAN card.

08:09.834 --> 08:11.626
Easy, easy. Sorry.

08:12.126 --> 08:15.501
PAN card, ATM card and credit card.

08:15.917 --> 08:21.667
There was a railway pass. Some
cash. My wife's photograph.

08:21.709 --> 08:24.876
You have already said that.
- What?

08:25.167 --> 08:27.501
You have already told me about
your wife's photograph.

08:28.876 --> 08:32.917
How much cash was in it?
- Around 300-350 rupees.

08:34.084 --> 08:37.376
Where is the washroom?
- What's your name and address?

08:38.417 --> 08:45.709
Rajesh Kumar Sharma. 301,
Manasarovar Society.

08:46.084 --> 08:49.667
S.V. road, Borivali, west.

08:49.959 --> 08:55.084
What's your telephone number?
- 9832456784.

08:57.459 --> 08:59.042
Take this. Call up tomorrow
and enquire.

09:00.584 --> 09:02.376
The washroom is to the
right over there.

09:02.834 --> 09:03.959
Thank you.

10:09.501 --> 10:11.876
Sir, it's always a number from
Karachi that flashes on my mobile.

10:12.167 --> 10:17.917
Initially, he used to address
me as brother, sir or boss.

10:19.209 --> 10:20.876
He had said his name was Imtiaz.

10:21.084 --> 10:23.626
He said he watches my
films many times…

10:23.709 --> 10:25.709
… and that he was a
great fan of mine.

10:27.501 --> 10:29.876
Then he called today and asked
me to pay up 25 lakh rupees…

10:29.959 --> 10:31.959
… said it was an emergency.

10:34.584 --> 10:38.459
Mr. Arjun Khanna, what
exactly did he say?

11:00.751 --> 11:01.876
Hello!

11:01.917 --> 11:04.834
Why aren't you signing Desai's film?

11:05.042 --> 11:08.501
He is my special friend. If I don't
get any good news by noon…

11:08.709 --> 11:12.584
I will pack-up your shooting forever.

11:12.667 --> 11:14.751
That…
- And keep 25 lakh rupees on hand.

11:14.959 --> 11:17.292
I will call you later and
tell you whom to give it to.

11:17.376 --> 11:18.501
25 lakhs!

11:18.542 --> 11:19.959
And why the hell do you delay
so much to take the call?

11:20.251 --> 11:22.501
Make sure that you pick it up
within two rings the next time. - That I…

11:31.876 --> 11:34.251
Hello?
- 'Just checking. Hang up now.'

11:46.876 --> 11:48.001
Where is Jai?

11:49.834 --> 11:52.042
You know that I don't like your
travelling in the train with the baby?

11:52.876 --> 11:55.292
If I go by road, I will
reach tomorrow.

11:55.626 --> 11:57.501
Why do you go to your
mom's place so often?

11:57.792 --> 12:00.292
This is the first time I am
going since she was born.

12:00.334 --> 12:03.084
But she'd come to our house
just last week. - So?

12:04.042 --> 12:06.126
She was also there the
week before that. - So?

12:06.792 --> 12:09.251
This should stop… or else
the sub-inspector in…

12:09.292 --> 12:12.334
… your mom's area is a
good friend of mine.

12:12.917 --> 12:14.417
Why are you so scared of my mom?

12:14.709 --> 12:17.542
I'm not scared. Just
jealous of her…

12:17.626 --> 12:20.126
… that she spends so much more
time with you two than me.

12:20.209 --> 12:24.876
Ok. I will take your leave.
Bye. Take care. Bye.

12:25.709 --> 12:28.001
Call me up. - Yes, I will
call up on reaching there.

12:35.292 --> 12:37.209
Okay, bye.
- Bye.

12:37.292 --> 12:38.834
See you. Take care.

12:40.001 --> 12:43.501
Just 20 rupees! Where is your
pollution certificate?

12:46.709 --> 12:49.584
Come on, sir. Keep it.

12:49.667 --> 12:54.292
You don't even have one document
with you. Take out the money.

12:54.792 --> 12:57.167
Where is your license? Look, you
don't have license with you.

12:57.417 --> 12:59.251
Now come on, give me 500 rupees.

12:59.292 --> 13:02.334
Come on, sir, take it. Keep it.

13:02.417 --> 13:07.084
Give me 500 rupees.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.417
Hello, sir.

13:13.834 --> 13:14.959
What are you doing?

13:15.167 --> 13:18.417
Sir, I have stopped asking.
But they keep bribing me willingly.

13:18.501 --> 13:20.334
Ask him… wasn't I telling
you not to give me anything?

13:20.376 --> 13:22.084
Sir, what can I do if they
give it with so much love?

13:22.126 --> 13:24.084
Too much of such love
has made you plump.

13:24.167 --> 13:26.042
And you still want some more.
- Sorry, sir.

13:26.292 --> 13:28.167
How much did you take?
- 20 rupees!

13:28.376 --> 13:31.042
Give it back!
- Take it.

13:31.501 --> 13:33.376
Give him 20 more.
- What?

13:34.542 --> 13:38.084
You should share your love
with others too. - Okay, sir.

13:41.459 --> 13:43.001
Did you just give me money?

13:43.917 --> 13:46.126
Father was right and I was wrong.

13:47.084 --> 13:50.292
Times have changed. The new age
is here - All right, go on.

13:53.376 --> 13:57.084
This is good! This is good!
This is good! This is good!

13:57.209 --> 14:00.542
"Come on, yes!"

14:02.459 --> 14:07.834
"Okay, say yes! Okay!"

14:14.084 --> 14:17.417
Ready to move in!
Three! Two! One! Go!

14:17.626 --> 14:18.792
Thank you, Deepak.

14:19.167 --> 14:20.459
This is the same electric
pole to which…

14:20.542 --> 14:24.334
… a man had been stuck to for
15 minutes and still survived.

14:24.584 --> 14:26.709
Yes. Shambhu fell
in this pothole…

14:26.834 --> 14:29.876
… while returning from
work last evening.

14:29.959 --> 14:33.376
Because of this live wire,
he got stuck to this pole.

14:33.459 --> 14:35.084
And it is a miracle that
he is still alive…

14:35.167 --> 14:36.792
… after receiving electric shock…

14:36.876 --> 14:38.709
… of such high voltage for
15 minutes consecutively.

14:39.001 --> 14:45.376
So let's talk to Shambhu who had
experienced this incident.

14:45.792 --> 14:48.042
Mr. Shambhu, how do you feel?

14:49.209 --> 14:50.334
I feel good.

14:51.126 --> 14:53.834
Tell our viewers how
did you feel when…

14:53.917 --> 14:57.501
… such high voltage currents were
passing through your body?

15:01.417 --> 15:03.209
Call for technical snag
in ten seconds.

15:03.292 --> 15:04.501
Naina, repeat the question.

15:04.584 --> 15:06.292
Tell us how did you feel when…

15:06.376 --> 15:10.001
… high voltage currents were
passing through you?

15:11.334 --> 15:13.626
Great! I felt very good.

15:15.209 --> 15:18.084
Now people call you
'The Electric man.'

15:18.167 --> 15:19.959
How does that feel?

15:23.292 --> 15:25.084
Very good.
- Cut it!

15:25.876 --> 15:27.001
What is it, now?

15:28.209 --> 15:29.876
We'll do it again in five minutes!

15:29.959 --> 15:33.417
Give him something to say.
He seems to like everything.

15:35.292 --> 15:36.501
He gets drunk and falls down.

15:36.834 --> 15:38.167
The other day, we both
drank together…

15:38.251 --> 15:39.626
… and we both fell together
in the gutter but…

15:39.709 --> 15:41.709
… nobody cared then. Now look
at him, he has become famous.

16:23.376 --> 16:24.709
Get me out of here.

16:26.251 --> 16:27.542
They beat me up everyday.

16:28.126 --> 16:31.501
Two guys came in my cell yesterday
and beat me all over.

16:32.667 --> 16:34.792
You'd said I would be okay
if I turned informer.

16:35.334 --> 16:36.417
But look what happened?

16:39.001 --> 16:40.876
I was put to rot in here and you
were transferred to the ATS.

16:41.417 --> 16:43.542
Arif, either get me out
of this place or kill me.

16:43.709 --> 16:44.834
But don't leave me here.

16:45.292 --> 16:47.626
My family is being
threatened everyday.

16:48.709 --> 16:51.501
The constable who is supposed to
protect my family…

16:51.584 --> 16:52.876
… harasses my sister.

16:57.042 --> 16:59.126
I have heard that you are going to
get transferred somewhere else?

17:00.292 --> 17:01.417
I heard it too.

17:01.542 --> 17:04.042
If the department doesn't care
about you, why will it care for me?

17:05.084 --> 17:06.917
Can I get a cup of tea?
- Right away, sir.

17:12.709 --> 17:15.792
You want to go to the hospital?
- Sure.

17:17.167 --> 17:19.626
Stay there for some days.
I will take care of the rest.

17:20.417 --> 17:23.542
You trust me, don't you?
- I have only you to trust.

17:32.667 --> 17:34.001
Thank you, brother.

17:39.917 --> 17:43.501
Who is on duty at your house?
- Badge number 1275.

17:46.709 --> 17:48.834
Sir, I feel that
I am being targeted…

17:48.917 --> 17:50.626
… because I belong to
the minority group.

17:50.917 --> 17:55.459
Minority! Mr. Arjun Khanna, how can
you belong to a minority group?

17:56.876 --> 17:59.001
The Khan's are in majority
in our film industry.

17:59.667 --> 18:03.667
It's just Mr. Amitabh, Abhishek
and I on the other side.

18:04.709 --> 18:07.876
That's true.
- Sir.

18:14.167 --> 18:15.667
Mr. Khanna, this is sub-inspector
Jai Singh.

18:16.292 --> 18:17.667
He will handle your case.

18:17.709 --> 18:19.792
Be rest assured,
we will crack this soon.

18:21.792 --> 18:23.209
Sir, I just hope nothing
will happen to me.

18:23.459 --> 18:25.167
C'mon! You are a hero.

18:25.209 --> 18:27.084
Does anything ever happen to
our heroes in our films?

18:28.376 --> 18:29.709
Sometimes it does.

18:29.834 --> 18:32.542
Just in case anything
happens to you then…

18:32.626 --> 18:34.959
… I assure you that we
will not spare them.

18:35.292 --> 18:36.501
Sir, what are you…

18:36.584 --> 18:39.876
Relax! Go to work. Nothing
will happen to you.

18:40.167 --> 18:41.667
Thank you, sir. Thank you very much.

18:41.792 --> 18:42.917
It is okay.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.209
My brother. My brother.

18:51.042 --> 18:52.334
Thank you! Thank you.

18:54.334 --> 18:55.792
Thank you, sir.
- Yes, mention not.

18:59.334 --> 19:02.792
These are our heroes. One phone
call and he gets a stomach ache.

19:02.876 --> 19:04.876
Some kids from Shantinagar
are playing a prank on him.

19:04.959 --> 19:06.209
Patwardhan knows them.

19:06.292 --> 19:09.959
Ask him to stop them or else he
will be wasting our time needlessly.

19:10.084 --> 19:12.626
Right, sir. - Yes.

19:13.542 --> 19:15.709
Shambhu, who is responsible
for this incident?

19:16.292 --> 19:19.417
I feel they did a good job by
putting up an electric pole.

19:19.709 --> 19:21.501
But they should not
have dug this hole.

19:22.084 --> 19:24.626
The government should think
twice before digging…

19:24.709 --> 19:29.417
… that a common man like me
can fall into this pothole.

19:29.709 --> 19:31.626
Look around! Today there
are potholes everywhere.

19:31.959 --> 19:35.084
I mean are there potholes in the
city or is this city in potholes?

19:35.334 --> 19:37.626
This government should take
responsibility for these potholes.

19:37.792 --> 19:41.126
So what do you feel? Why does
the government do such things?

19:41.292 --> 19:43.376
The government likes to dig.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.501
So this was Mr. Shambhu a.k.a.
Electric man who…

19:46.584 --> 19:49.251
… has given death itself
a very big shock.

19:49.459 --> 19:52.876
This is Naina Roy with cameraman
Raj for UTV news.

20:19.876 --> 20:23.626
Sir… sir, why are you hitting me?

20:25.167 --> 20:31.334
Sir, why are you hitting me?

21:58.626 --> 22:00.417
Yes, tell me!
- Don't get annoyed but…

22:00.501 --> 22:02.209
… I just found out
that I don't have…

22:02.334 --> 22:04.376
… some ingredients to
make the rice pudding.

22:04.459 --> 22:06.751
Yes. - You know very well that Ishan
loves rice pudding.

22:07.084 --> 22:09.501
While coming home, bring
some almonds, raisins…

22:09.542 --> 22:10.751
All right, I will bring
all those things.

22:10.792 --> 22:12.917
Don't forget to buy those tomatoes.
- No, I won't.

22:13.501 --> 22:16.042
I am sorry. Are you angry with me?

22:17.042 --> 22:22.709
Just a bit. But then, I have the
whole city to vent it out on.

22:23.334 --> 22:24.459
When will you come back?

22:24.667 --> 22:25.792
Around 7 o'clock.

22:26.001 --> 22:27.584
Come back and we'll talk.
- Yes.

23:15.751 --> 23:18.876
The government should think
twice before digging…

23:18.959 --> 23:21.751
… that a common man like me
can fall into this pothole.

23:21.959 --> 23:23.834
Look around! Today there
are potholes everywhere.

23:24.334 --> 23:27.167
I mean, are there potholes in the
city or is this city in potholes?

23:27.667 --> 23:29.251
The government should take
responsibility for these potholes.

23:39.334 --> 23:40.417
Don't hit me, sir!

23:40.501 --> 23:48.501
Sir… sir, please forgive me.

23:48.542 --> 23:50.042
No, sir. Please forgive me.

24:35.751 --> 24:38.251
Hello.
- Is it Commissioner Prakash Rathod?

24:38.501 --> 24:39.626
Who's this?

24:39.667 --> 24:41.917
Mr. Rathod, don't interrupt
and just listen.

24:43.334 --> 24:47.876
I have planted bombs at five
different locations in the city.

24:48.792 --> 24:52.376
All these bombs will
explode at 6.30 p.m.

24:54.209 --> 24:55.542
But this can be avoided.

24:56.334 --> 24:58.667
I will
call you up 30 minutes later…

24:58.751 --> 25:03.751
… with my demands and I want to talk
or negotiate with only one person.

25:04.542 --> 25:07.334
Until then you can decide
who that person should be.

25:09.126 --> 25:10.376
Hello!

25:17.292 --> 25:20.042
Find out who had called on my
mobile just a while back.

25:21.334 --> 25:22.542
Jai, where is the Chief Minister?

25:30.292 --> 25:32.001
Hello.
- Miss Naina Roy?

25:32.376 --> 25:33.542
Yes, who is this?

25:33.584 --> 25:36.126
It doesn't matter. I just
wanted to ask you…

25:36.209 --> 25:41.167
… whether you are interested
in some serious news.

25:41.334 --> 25:44.792
What? Is this some kind…
- Just answer me, Naina.

25:46.501 --> 25:50.751
This is big. Are you interested?
Yes or no?

25:54.126 --> 25:55.251
Yes.

25:55.334 --> 25:57.792
Then come to the Mumbai police
headquarters with your cameraman.

25:58.667 --> 26:01.126
This is going to be the most
important day of your life.

26:02.001 --> 26:03.126
I will call you again.

26:05.834 --> 26:06.917
Raj!

26:07.376 --> 26:08.917
I know this is an unknown number.

26:09.251 --> 26:11.376
Keep trying. I want
that number within five minutes.

26:11.959 --> 26:14.709
And ask Khatri to tap my mobile
phone immediately. Okay.

26:16.167 --> 26:18.876
Yes, Tiwari, I am putting him
on the line. Right away.

26:19.292 --> 26:20.709
Sir, its Tiwari.

26:20.792 --> 26:22.542
Mr. Tiwari!
- Yes, Mr. Prakash, tell me.

26:22.584 --> 26:23.709
Where is the CM?

26:23.959 --> 26:25.917
He is in Bandra to attend
an important meeting.

26:26.001 --> 26:27.084
Put Mr. Patil on the line.

26:27.626 --> 26:30.126
Mr. Patil is in a meeting too.
Tell me, what is the matter?

26:30.209 --> 26:32.126
It is a very minor thing.
I cannot bother you with it.

26:32.376 --> 26:33.542
Get Patil on the line.

26:35.292 --> 26:36.459
Sir, I hope you understood.

26:36.501 --> 26:37.626
Sir, he wants to talk to you.

26:37.709 --> 26:40.001
Excuse me.
- Okay. - Yes, Mr. Prakash.

26:40.084 --> 26:42.751
I don't know how but come to
my office within 15 minutes.

26:42.792 --> 26:44.542
But… - Within 15 minutes.
It's an emergency.

26:44.917 --> 26:46.334
Jai, tell Chouhan, Ramesh
and Aakash to come to…

26:46.417 --> 26:47.917
… the WAR Room.
- Right, sir.

26:53.542 --> 26:55.126
Sir. It is a prepaid mobile number.

26:55.209 --> 26:56.334
It is registered to
one Jignesh Sheth.

26:56.459 --> 26:58.459
He lives in Malad. I have informed
Malad police station.

26:58.542 --> 27:00.917
This number is unreachable
right now. - Okay.

27:04.709 --> 27:05.834
Attention guys!

27:56.209 --> 27:58.167
This issue should not
get out of this room.

27:58.626 --> 28:02.251
Does anyone of you wish to
call anybody or warn anyone?

28:02.334 --> 28:03.501
No sir!

28:10.001 --> 28:11.584
We have just four hours left.

28:11.959 --> 28:13.376
Chouhan, talk to Abbas
at Intelligence…

28:13.459 --> 28:15.251
… and find out what they have.

28:15.542 --> 28:18.251
Tell them that you need this
information for verification.

28:18.501 --> 28:19.626
Yes, sir!

28:24.084 --> 28:25.876
Vatkar, find out from
our sources whether…

28:25.959 --> 28:27.959
… there has been any movement
in any terrorist module.

28:28.001 --> 28:30.501
Get me the information on explosives
being taken in and out of the city.

28:30.584 --> 28:32.084
Get in touch with your informers.

28:32.167 --> 28:33.459
Right, sir.

28:33.542 --> 28:35.209
Aakash, we need to trace
the call the next time.

28:35.292 --> 28:37.001
Put your best men on the job.
- Yes, sir!

28:41.501 --> 28:43.584
Mr. Rathod, how are you?
- I am fine. And you?

28:43.667 --> 28:44.917
Fine. Tell me.

28:45.042 --> 28:47.751
Just a while back, I received a call
on my cell phone. - One man…

29:24.626 --> 29:27.751
Oh God. Excuse me.

30:02.917 --> 30:04.042
It could also be a crank call.

30:04.167 --> 30:05.834
We can't take any chances.
Where is the CM?

30:05.917 --> 30:07.042
He is on his way.

30:43.834 --> 30:45.917
Hello! Yes, Mr. Rathod.

30:46.626 --> 30:48.001
Who is going to talk to me?

30:48.042 --> 30:51.417
Mr. Roy. He will be here soon.
Till then you can talk to me.

30:51.876 --> 30:55.292
I will only talk to the person who
has the authority to take decisions.

30:55.834 --> 30:57.334
I will call you again
in five minutes.

30:58.876 --> 31:02.542
By the way, let me remind you that
you are wasting your own time.

31:04.084 --> 31:07.751
Take my advice. You shouldn't
buy time on this.

31:10.876 --> 31:14.126
Too short to trace. But this is not
the same number as the previous one.

31:14.334 --> 31:14.876
Excuse me, sir.

31:17.834 --> 31:19.209
There was a call from
Malad police station.

31:19.459 --> 31:21.459
Nobody named Jignesh Sheth
lives at that address.

31:22.876 --> 31:25.709
Do one thing, tell Solanki to
alert all the police stations.

31:26.501 --> 31:27.751
Sir, the CM is on the line.

31:31.209 --> 31:33.001
Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.

31:33.459 --> 31:35.292
Who is this Roy?
- Nobody.

31:35.542 --> 31:36.834
Who is negotiating with
him from our side?

31:36.917 --> 31:39.084
Sir, you will. We will patch
his call to you from here.

31:40.126 --> 31:44.917
Why? - Because you have the authority
and you know how to negotiate.

31:47.834 --> 31:50.167
There is a lot of difference between
giving a speech and negotiating.

31:50.459 --> 31:51.584
This is not a political rally.

31:51.667 --> 31:54.042
What about Patil or Tiwari?

31:54.626 --> 31:55.751
Oh my God!

31:55.834 --> 31:59.251
Prakash, I have never seen you
avoiding any responsibilities.

31:59.292 --> 32:00.417
There is a reason for it.

32:01.584 --> 32:03.126
If this man is telling the
truth then to stop him…

32:03.209 --> 32:05.584
… we require a person with
an unlimited authority.

32:05.876 --> 32:07.584
There shouldn't be any
red tape or protocol.

32:08.209 --> 32:10.334
He would need absolute
and complete freedom.

32:10.709 --> 32:14.292
He should not be questioned
about anything.

32:15.167 --> 32:17.709
And I know that this is not
possible and that's why…

32:17.792 --> 32:19.876
… I was avoiding my
responsibility, sir.

32:21.501 --> 32:24.751
Patil, this operation will be
headed by Prakash Rathod.

32:25.417 --> 32:28.542
I don't want any complaints
from him. Do you understand?

32:28.626 --> 32:29.709
I'll be there soon.

32:29.792 --> 32:31.876
Yes, sir. Should we
inform the center?

32:32.042 --> 32:34.459
This is our problem and
we have to solve it.

32:35.251 --> 32:36.376
Okay, sir.

32:36.459 --> 32:38.542
Come on, guys, back
to work, everyone.

32:41.667 --> 32:42.792
Excuse me.
- Yes.

32:47.417 --> 32:48.751
Hello.
- Mr. Rathod?

32:49.251 --> 32:51.126
Mr. Roy won't be here.
I will negotiate instead of him.

32:51.334 --> 32:53.584
How can he come there
if he doesn't exist?

32:53.917 --> 32:55.042
What do you want?

32:55.126 --> 32:58.917
Ibrahim Khan, Iqlak Ahmed,
Mohammed Zaheer and Khursheed Lala.

33:00.001 --> 33:01.126
Who are these guys?

33:02.126 --> 33:05.709
You had caught two of them yourself.
And the ATS got the other two.

33:06.251 --> 33:07.417
I hope it is not difficult.

33:07.459 --> 33:09.917
Why would it be? We are used to it.

33:11.042 --> 33:12.292
First, we put our lives at
stake and catch them and…

33:12.376 --> 33:14.376
… then when we get a phone call,
we set them free.

33:14.584 --> 33:16.126
You will do the same thing today.

33:17.167 --> 33:19.667
They all are in different
places right now.

33:19.709 --> 33:21.751
I will call you in an hour.

33:22.209 --> 33:25.792
Till then it is your job to get
them together at one place.

33:25.876 --> 33:27.251
On whose behalf are you doing this?

33:27.334 --> 33:28.584
What is the name of
your organization?

33:30.626 --> 33:34.876
Do you suspect that this
is a crank call?

33:35.584 --> 33:36.709
I do.

33:37.501 --> 33:40.001
Mr. Rathod, you must
know by now that…

33:40.084 --> 33:43.209
… Jignesh Sheth had died
in the last bomb blast.

33:44.001 --> 33:45.209
The next number belonged
to Sanjay Singh…

33:45.292 --> 33:48.251
… who had died three months back.

33:48.709 --> 33:51.459
The current number that you
will trace belongs to…

33:51.542 --> 33:53.626
… Shabbir Ahmed who has also
died a long way back.

33:54.001 --> 33:56.667
Any Tom, Dick and Harry can do this.

33:56.751 --> 33:58.751
Yes I agree. But any Tom,
Dick and Harry…

33:58.834 --> 34:00.834
… cannot blow away
the police station…

34:00.917 --> 34:04.251
… which is just opposite
your police headquarters.

34:05.084 --> 34:06.334
What do you mean?

34:06.417 --> 34:10.209
It means I have also planted a
bomb in the police station…

34:10.292 --> 34:13.334
… opposite your headquarters
just to prove…

34:13.417 --> 34:17.376
… my mettle and your helplessness.

34:18.834 --> 34:23.042
You have 20 minutes to
find it. So go find it.

34:23.667 --> 34:26.126
Or else, an hour later,
I may have to talk to someone else.

34:34.251 --> 34:36.542
Mr. Prakash, can we go
out for half an hour.

34:36.626 --> 34:38.167
Jai!
- Yes sir!

34:38.251 --> 34:39.459
Are you afraid?
- No, sir.

34:39.667 --> 34:41.209
Are you married?
- Two years ago.

34:41.292 --> 34:42.876
Do you have a kid?
- I have a three month old daughter.

34:43.001 --> 34:44.376
What happens if you die?
- I don't care.

34:44.459 --> 34:46.667
I want that bomb found within ten
minutes. - You'll get it, sir.

34:56.334 --> 34:57.459
Give me your radio.
- Sir.

35:06.084 --> 35:07.209
Hello.

35:07.251 --> 35:09.584
Naina Roy, someone has
planted a bomb…

35:09.667 --> 35:11.751
… in the police station opposite
the headquarters.

35:12.751 --> 35:14.417
I thought you'd be interested.

35:15.917 --> 35:17.167
Oh God!

35:17.251 --> 35:20.667
Relax guys! This man wants
us to find the bomb.

35:21.542 --> 35:24.917
He wants us to take him seriously.
He wants us to find it.

35:50.209 --> 35:54.917
We just have one hour. I don't
want to talk to this man again.

35:55.501 --> 35:57.042
Sir, Chouhan is on the line.

35:58.626 --> 35:59.876
Chouhan, tell me.

36:00.001 --> 36:01.126
Sir, the Intelligence has
no information about this.

36:01.501 --> 36:02.709
That's consistent.

36:03.667 --> 36:04.792
Chouhan, step up
security at airports…

36:04.876 --> 36:06.709
… rail stations and bus depots.

36:06.792 --> 36:08.459
Search everything and everyone.

36:08.667 --> 36:11.001
Send them in batches of four
to the multiplexes as well.

36:11.042 --> 36:13.126
I want you to cover up as
much ground as possible.

36:13.209 --> 36:14.834
If someone asks tell them
it is just a police drill…

36:14.917 --> 36:16.084
… or tell them it's
the CM's orders.

36:16.167 --> 36:17.292
Get on it now!

36:21.001 --> 36:22.251
All units alert, sir.

36:22.334 --> 36:23.459
Deshmukh, where is my bomb squad?

36:30.876 --> 36:34.001
Aakash, call up Arif. I
want him here as soon as possible.

36:34.251 --> 36:36.042
And I want an update on Ibrahim
Khan, Iqlak Ahmed…

36:36.126 --> 36:38.209
… Mohammad Zaheer
and Khursheed Lala.

36:38.417 --> 36:39.834
You've got ten minutes.
- Yes sir.

36:42.084 --> 36:43.209
Then send them here!

36:47.209 --> 36:48.834
Bomb squad! Come in!
Bomb squad! Come in!

37:22.167 --> 37:23.251
Yes sir, come in.

37:23.334 --> 37:25.084
Has nobody seen Baburao?
Yes Mhatre, come in.

37:25.292 --> 37:27.001
Sir, we've found the bomb.
- Copy that.

37:35.709 --> 37:37.417
What is it? - Sir, it is RDX.

37:38.334 --> 37:43.459
You… come here! A bomb
was placed right under nose!

37:43.834 --> 37:46.126
What the hell were you doing?
Who is the shift in-charge?

37:46.334 --> 37:48.334
Sir, there was a shift change
just half an hour ago.

37:48.417 --> 37:49.501
I don't know anything.

37:49.584 --> 37:52.001
Find him in five minutes and
send him to me. - Okay sir.

37:52.084 --> 37:54.751
Sir! We have located
the bomb. It is RDX.

37:54.834 --> 37:56.334
He had planned to trigger
it with a cell phone.

37:56.542 --> 37:57.667
Good.

37:59.376 --> 38:01.792
Sir, please come this way.
I have solid information.

38:01.876 --> 38:03.001
There has been a pull-up
from the underworld.

38:03.042 --> 38:05.001
He had supplied 6 kilograms of
RDX couple of days back.

38:05.251 --> 38:06.376
He has not opened his mouth yet.

38:06.417 --> 38:07.542
On threatening him,
he said he has taken…

38:07.626 --> 38:08.834
… his painkillers just this
morning. - That's a new one.

38:16.042 --> 38:17.459
Sir, I don't know anything!

38:17.542 --> 38:19.501
Did I ask you anything?
Did I ask you anything?

38:22.292 --> 38:25.709
Did I ask you anything?
Did I ask you anything?

38:26.459 --> 38:32.626
No. - Did I ask you anything?
Did I ask you anything?

38:36.584 --> 38:39.001
Nobody has confirmed this
information but…

38:39.042 --> 38:41.126
… suddenly there is a lot of
activity in the police station.

38:41.334 --> 38:43.667
You can see the bomb squad
and the sniffer dogs here.

38:43.709 --> 38:45.042
They have just come out.

38:45.126 --> 38:48.042
But we have been denied
any information about it.

38:48.334 --> 38:50.417
We would like to inform our
viewers once again that…

38:50.501 --> 38:51.917
… we had received information…

38:52.001 --> 38:53.209
… about the bomb via
a telephone call.

38:53.542 --> 38:55.626
Seems that the bomb has
been found and diffused.

38:55.709 --> 38:58.667
We have not received
any confirmation yet.

38:58.751 --> 39:00.459
But we will keep trying.

39:00.667 --> 39:03.876
From Mumbai, this is Naina Roy with
cameraman Raj for UTV news. - Over.

39:04.292 --> 39:06.584
I want the forensic report
immediately in the WAR room.

39:06.626 --> 39:07.751
Sir! - Okay sir.

39:13.792 --> 39:14.917
Thank you.

39:20.251 --> 39:22.626
Mhatre come in. copy.

39:25.292 --> 39:28.001
Sir, the psycho has arrived.
Someone's going to die today.

39:33.126 --> 39:34.792
Hello.
- Are you busy?

39:35.209 --> 39:36.626
Yes. Not really.

39:36.834 --> 39:38.251
We have reached here safely.

39:38.792 --> 39:40.501
How is mom?
- She is fine.

39:41.167 --> 39:42.251
Give it to me.

39:44.001 --> 39:45.126
What is the matter? Are you
worried about something?

39:45.626 --> 39:48.667
Not at all.
- I'll call you before leaving.

39:49.459 --> 39:51.126
Okay. Take care. Bye.

39:51.376 --> 39:53.001
There was no direct contact with me.

39:53.209 --> 39:54.501
I only gave the delivery.

39:55.542 --> 39:58.126
I got a message to deliver
that bag to Rafiq.

39:58.876 --> 40:02.584
He was Rafiq's customer.
I asked Rafiq who he was.

40:03.042 --> 40:06.126
He said, your place is behind
and asked me to shut up.

40:07.376 --> 40:08.626
Where can I find Rafiq?

40:09.209 --> 40:12.042
Sir, I don't know. If I had
known I would tell you.

40:12.459 --> 40:14.292
Believe me. sir, I would…

40:25.501 --> 40:27.792
Bohri market. Fourth Lane.

40:29.459 --> 40:30.709
Where are you these days?

40:31.167 --> 40:33.542
I am with the ATS. You
had got me transferred.

40:33.626 --> 40:36.084
Yes. Arif, I want that man and
the information that he has.

40:36.167 --> 40:38.167
Vatkar will tell you where to
find him. Don't kill him.

40:38.251 --> 40:39.334
I just need the information.

40:39.626 --> 40:40.751
Okay, sir.
- Okay.

40:41.792 --> 40:43.459
Yes.
- Sir, the bomb has been diffused.

40:43.834 --> 40:46.001
Who was on duty?
- Prashant.

40:46.334 --> 40:49.001
Tell him to go home. He will receive
his termination letter tomorrow.

40:49.167 --> 40:51.084
Tell Kailash to take over.

40:51.167 --> 40:53.001
The media is here. UTV news.

40:54.876 --> 40:56.376
Bring them upstairs.
- Right sir.

41:02.751 --> 41:05.542
Ibrahim Khan. He has links
with the Al Qaeda.

41:05.584 --> 41:07.792
He was head-of-operations
in India since 1992.

41:08.001 --> 41:10.292
This is his designation
on their website.

41:10.876 --> 41:12.084
He has started 45
madrasas (Islamic schools)…

41:12.167 --> 41:13.417
… in the country…

41:13.501 --> 41:16.167
… where little kids are taught
the meaning of Jihad (holy war).

41:16.584 --> 41:18.334
They will
be weakened by his capture and if…

41:18.417 --> 41:21.376
… he is set free then they will
be completely rejuvenated.

41:21.751 --> 41:23.834
This is their second
attempt to free him.

41:23.876 --> 41:25.042
He is extremely dangerous.

41:30.834 --> 41:34.501
Iqlak Ahmed. Al Qaeda again.
Right hand of Ibrahim Khan.

41:34.751 --> 41:36.042
He is a former ISI agent.
The theory is that…

41:36.126 --> 41:39.626
… when you had nabbed him
he wanted to get caught.

41:39.709 --> 41:41.917
So that it would be easy
to free Ibrahim Khan.

41:42.209 --> 41:44.376
He was directly or indirectly
involved in all…

41:44.459 --> 41:47.292
… the terrorists attacks in India
in the last three years.

41:47.376 --> 41:49.417
He is equally dangerous if not more.

41:53.626 --> 41:56.126
Mohammad Zaheer. He is the number
two agent of Lashkar in India.

41:56.209 --> 41:58.001
He is a former ISI as well
as former Al Qaeda member.

41:58.667 --> 42:00.084
He was a software engineer.

42:00.292 --> 42:02.417
Due to systematic brainwashing,
he went to Pakistan.

42:02.501 --> 42:03.626
From there, he went to Afghanistan.

42:03.667 --> 42:04.792
He acquired his training over there.

42:04.876 --> 42:07.000
He has designed a lot
of websites for them.

42:07.001 --> 42:10.459
One of his websites is called
www.indiakitabaahi.com

42:10.834 --> 42:12.417
Very basic but very effective.

42:12.501 --> 42:14.917
It registered record number
of hits the day it opened.

42:15.167 --> 42:17.417
He is in our C-Zone hospital
since last week.

42:17.626 --> 42:19.167
He had complained of chest pains.

42:25.001 --> 42:27.042
Khursheed Lala. He is an arms agent.

42:27.209 --> 42:30.209
He is not connected to just one
organization but with all of them.

42:30.584 --> 42:33.459
If you need arms and explosives
then this is your guy.

42:33.542 --> 42:35.876
He will supply any
quantity you want.

42:36.042 --> 42:40.209
No matter whether it is 1993 or 2006,
Lala is behind the bars or free.

42:40.251 --> 42:42.042
He doesn't leave a trail.

42:42.334 --> 42:44.084
Sir, you may remember that even
when you had arrested him…

42:44.167 --> 42:46.167
… we had only found
a blueprint of…

42:46.251 --> 42:49.001
… Mumbai city and
a revolver on him.

42:49.209 --> 42:51.126
He will be out on bail very soon.

42:53.417 --> 42:54.584
Sir, Here is a speculation.

42:55.042 --> 42:58.417
Look at this. We don't know his
name but he is everywhere.

42:58.709 --> 43:00.542
He has succeeded to
remain out of sight.

43:00.792 --> 43:03.626
Our intelligence agencies have
no information about him.

43:03.667 --> 43:05.667
There are only rumours.

43:06.001 --> 43:09.167
Some say he is their CEO and others
say he is the chief strategist.

43:09.542 --> 43:11.167
Sir, he is one among the crowd.

43:11.542 --> 43:14.792
Even his wife doesn't know
what he really does.

43:15.167 --> 43:16.959
This man could be behind this call.

43:36.751 --> 43:39.751
He may belong to Lashkar,
Al Qaeda or some other outfit.

43:40.084 --> 43:42.001
We don't know whether he
is in the country or not.

43:42.792 --> 43:45.376
There must be a couple of people
with him in this operation.

43:45.667 --> 43:47.501
They have already targeted the
stock exchange…

43:47.584 --> 43:48.792
… buses and local trains.

43:49.001 --> 43:51.251
I suspect this time they
will go a step further.

43:51.917 --> 43:53.917
That they have come so close
to the police headquarters…

43:54.001 --> 43:55.209
… has business written all over it.

43:56.334 --> 43:58.959
Aakash, this man is in the city.
We have to catch him.

43:59.167 --> 44:00.501
Sir, what should we do
about the other four?

44:00.709 --> 44:03.084
We are always two steps behind
them and if they are freed…

44:03.167 --> 44:04.334
Let them be where they are.

44:05.042 --> 44:06.417
It doesn't make any sense
to free Lala now…

44:06.501 --> 44:08.209
… he is going to get free as is.

44:08.501 --> 44:10.584
And by doing this, Lala will be
regarded a certified terrorist.

44:11.084 --> 44:12.584
Maybe they need Lala right now.

44:13.209 --> 44:14.376
Maybe.

44:14.751 --> 44:17.626
Uncle! Three cups of tea.

44:18.542 --> 44:19.792
Hey, send money to me.

44:50.626 --> 44:52.001
When did you receive the first call?

45:18.167 --> 45:20.376
Ok. Alright then you and your
cameraman will remain…

45:20.459 --> 45:23.501
… in custody until you come
out with the truth.

45:23.584 --> 45:25.584
He had called up at
around 2 p.m. and…

45:25.667 --> 45:28.084
… he had asked me to come here.

45:28.626 --> 45:29.751
He had also said that
this would be…

45:29.834 --> 45:31.834
… the most important day of my life.

46:02.667 --> 46:04.292
He is using you.

46:04.501 --> 46:09.167
He is watching our situation
and our panic live on TV.

46:09.334 --> 46:11.001
You are his bloody eyes.

46:41.626 --> 46:45.876
Sir, he is around 50.
Tall man. Wears a spectacle.

46:46.042 --> 46:47.376
He looks like a clerk.

46:48.626 --> 46:51.001
There is an under construction
building…

46:51.042 --> 46:53.584
… in Malad west, behind Pritam
Nagar. Om constructions.

46:53.792 --> 46:55.459
I had delivered the goods
on the 12th floor.

46:55.959 --> 46:58.084
Vatkar!
- Yes sir. - Take him away.

47:04.626 --> 47:07.251
Hello. Sir, this is Arif.
Yes I got it.

47:07.376 --> 47:09.001
There is an under construction
building in Malad.

47:10.209 --> 47:11.917
Vatkar is bringing Rafiq
to the headquarters.

47:12.792 --> 47:14.459
Should I send Jai?
- There's no need.

47:15.417 --> 47:16.542
I will nab him and get
him to speak to you.

47:27.501 --> 47:28.584
What did you say your name is?

47:28.667 --> 47:29.792
Sir… Naina.

47:30.042 --> 47:33.084
Naina, I want you
to do me a favour.

47:33.834 --> 47:37.376
Sir, until you don't tell me
everything, I can't help you.

47:38.834 --> 47:41.542
Okay. Come here.

47:44.084 --> 47:46.667
This matter should be only
between you and me.

48:12.251 --> 48:14.792
Three. Two. One. Go.

48:15.626 --> 48:18.042
Thanks Deepak… We have
just received information that…

48:18.084 --> 48:20.667
… four terrorists whose
names are Ibrahim Khan…

48:20.751 --> 48:23.834
… Iqlak Ahmed, Mohammad Zaheer
and Khursheed Lala…

48:23.917 --> 48:26.417
… are being shifted to
some other location.

48:26.626 --> 48:28.417
The police says it is because
of security reasons.

48:28.501 --> 48:30.501
Right now we have Senior
Inspector Jai Singh…

48:30.584 --> 48:32.334
… who will give us full information
about this matter.

48:33.126 --> 48:36.292
What is the reason behind shifting
these four to some other location?

48:36.834 --> 48:39.209
There are some security reasons.
We have orders to do so.

48:39.917 --> 48:41.334
But why such an order?

48:41.626 --> 48:43.917
We have received orders to do so.

48:44.459 --> 48:46.042
Can you tell us whether there is
any threat to them and from whom?

48:46.209 --> 48:48.209
It is because of some
security reasons…

48:48.292 --> 48:51.042
… that we have received
orders to shift them.

48:52.167 --> 48:55.501
As you can see, the police is not
giving us any further information.

48:55.584 --> 48:57.584
And they are trying to
avoid our questions…

48:57.667 --> 49:00.626
… by calling it a security reason.

49:00.792 --> 49:03.584
From Mumbai, this is Naina Roy with
cameraman Raj for UTV news.

49:03.834 --> 49:05.001
Cut it!

49:09.417 --> 49:12.042
Sir, please don't do this again.
My wife watches the news channels.

49:12.084 --> 49:13.209
That was good, Jai.

49:13.667 --> 49:14.792
Thank you, Naina.

51:03.959 --> 51:06.834
What is the reason behind shifting
these four to some other location?

51:07.459 --> 51:09.751
There are some security reasons.
We have orders to do so.

51:10.751 --> 51:12.251
But why such an order?

51:12.542 --> 51:14.126
We have received orders to do so.

51:31.334 --> 51:32.459
Arif, tell me.

51:32.501 --> 51:35.501
Sir, there is nobody here.
But he wanted us to come here.

51:35.584 --> 51:37.001
There are tags of 'Do
not disturb' in here.

51:38.417 --> 51:39.834
Come back.
- Yes sir.

51:41.126 --> 51:42.542
Jai.
- Yes sir.

51:43.501 --> 51:45.584
We have to shift these four
terrorists to a single location.

51:46.334 --> 51:48.126
Start the process.
- Sir.

53:40.584 --> 53:42.042
Mr. Rathod, Time is running out.

53:42.542 --> 53:44.292
How much longer are we going
to hide this from the public?

53:45.126 --> 53:46.251
What should we tell the public?

53:46.917 --> 53:49.084
We have no other choice
than to catch him.

53:50.042 --> 53:52.209
He is regularly monitoring
us through Naina Roy.

53:59.042 --> 54:01.542
If we sound an alert
then he will know…

54:06.709 --> 54:08.042
Hello!
- Hello.

54:09.584 --> 54:10.709
Yes, tell me.

54:10.792 --> 54:12.959
Sir, this is Sapna from HDFC
bank's credit card division.

54:13.042 --> 54:15.459
We are issuing you a
credit card for free.

54:15.584 --> 54:16.959
We have a new scheme
which benefit…

54:17.042 --> 54:18.167
… you with personal loan,
housing loan…

54:18.251 --> 54:20.167
I am not interested.
Don't ever call me.

54:20.251 --> 54:22.959
If you don't want it then say so.
Why are you getting rude, sir?

54:32.251 --> 54:33.376
Hello.

54:33.417 --> 54:34.917
Thank you very much.

54:35.126 --> 54:37.334
It's all right. What
else do you need?

54:38.251 --> 54:40.751
Money! Private plane! What else?

54:41.167 --> 54:44.959
No, thanks. I can arrange
for those things.

54:46.376 --> 54:50.542
Just put these four men in
a van and bring them to me.

54:51.376 --> 54:56.376
There is new strip on runway number
4 at the Juhu Aviation Base.

54:56.417 --> 54:58.084
It has not been opened for use yet.

54:58.626 --> 55:01.376
I want these men brought there
at exactly 5 o'clock.

55:02.584 --> 55:04.959
Only two officers should
accompany them.

55:05.834 --> 55:08.417
Both should carry cell phones
with loudspeaker facility.

55:09.209 --> 55:11.792
Because I will need confirmation
that they are okay.

55:13.292 --> 55:17.542
I should also tell you that this
area is already rigged so…

55:17.626 --> 55:23.626
… no snipers, no commandoes
and no surprises please.

55:23.709 --> 55:25.126
No funny business.

55:25.334 --> 55:26.417
I want to know something.

55:33.584 --> 55:34.709
Ask away.

55:34.751 --> 55:36.876
What kind of misconception are you
and your organization under?

55:37.834 --> 55:39.792
You are always hiding
from the police.

55:40.167 --> 55:43.251
Why don't you come in the open and
finish this matter once and for all?

55:46.417 --> 55:52.376
Mr. Rathod, we are cowards.
Are you happy now?

55:54.709 --> 55:57.416
Don't waste your time in trying
to get me aggravated.

55:57.417 --> 55:59.042
There is a face behind every voice.

55:59.126 --> 56:00.251
I don't have a face.

56:00.334 --> 56:01.751
That's what you think.
- No! I know it.

56:01.834 --> 56:06.126
What is the guarantee that you will
tell me the location of the bombs?

56:06.209 --> 56:09.417
Guarantee! Do you think
I am selling you a product?

56:09.542 --> 56:12.667
No. If I had thought so
I would not ask you this question.

56:13.542 --> 56:14.917
Thousands of lives are at stake.

56:15.126 --> 56:18.042
Do you have any other choice
than to trust me?

56:20.584 --> 56:22.626
I will call you again at 5 o clock.

56:26.334 --> 56:27.626
Aakash, tell me.

56:27.667 --> 56:28.792
We have a multiple trace.

56:28.876 --> 56:30.959
Mulund, Santacruz, Karachi,
Singapore and South Africa.

56:31.251 --> 56:32.542
This is unique. The call
is bounced off…

56:32.626 --> 56:34.626
… and manipulated without
being disconnected…

56:34.709 --> 56:37.167
… from different Sim cards and
landlines of different locations.

56:37.251 --> 56:39.084
The number switches to
another every minute.

56:39.126 --> 56:42.251
This is only possible if you route
your phone through a system.

56:42.334 --> 56:45.376
Whoever is doing this
is a very trained man?

56:45.417 --> 56:46.876
So you can't trace him?

56:46.959 --> 56:49.126
Sir, to do this, we need some
other kind of an expert.

56:49.292 --> 56:51.084
For example…
- We need a hacker.

56:51.167 --> 56:54.042
Then get one. Check the booking
list of Juhu Aviation.

56:54.209 --> 56:56.417
Find which private plane has
been booked by and for whom.

56:56.459 --> 56:59.417
Yes, sir. - Sir, there is
a sub-inspector outside.

56:59.459 --> 57:00.667
He has seen the man.

57:01.126 --> 57:05.709
Sir, I remember very well.
He had a black J&K bag with him.

57:06.626 --> 57:08.542
He had come to file a report
about his missing wallet.

57:08.626 --> 57:09.751
What were you doing there?

57:10.917 --> 57:13.626
Sir, there was so much security,
what else could I do?

57:13.917 --> 57:15.334
This is his number and address.

57:15.542 --> 57:18.126
I had tried his number. I'm getting
a 'does not exist message.'

57:18.417 --> 57:20.542
I have asked the Borivali police
to verify the address.

57:20.751 --> 57:22.376
This is not his address.
He is not such a fool.

57:22.917 --> 57:25.959
Take him to a sketch artist.
Make his sketch and show him.

57:26.042 --> 57:27.417
Where is Rafiq?
- He is in room number 12.

57:27.542 --> 57:30.251
Show the sketch to Rafiq and
verify it. - Right, sir.

58:00.876 --> 58:01.959
Hello.

58:02.042 --> 58:06.084
I want you to go to the main gate of
Juhu Aviation at exactly 5 o'clock.

58:06.126 --> 58:07.251
No.

58:08.126 --> 58:11.084
Excuse me! I didn't hear that.

58:11.292 --> 58:12.376
You are using me.

58:13.542 --> 58:15.751
If you are not interested then
you should've told me before.

58:15.876 --> 58:17.542
There is no dearth
of people like you.

58:17.626 --> 58:20.626
I am indirectly helping you.
I am being party to some…

58:20.667 --> 58:23.501
Come on! Come on!
Don't flatter yourself, Naina.

58:24.834 --> 58:27.417
If in a cricket match between
India and Pakistan…

58:27.459 --> 58:30.584
… India loses then nobody
blames the sports channels.

58:30.834 --> 58:32.459
This is not a cricket match!

58:32.501 --> 58:33.709
Yes or no!

58:35.834 --> 58:37.626
I have a dozen phone
numbers with me.

58:37.709 --> 58:40.001
There are a lot of news
hungry people out there.

58:40.209 --> 58:41.334
Yes or no!

58:47.751 --> 58:48.917
Yes.

58:49.001 --> 58:54.376
Good. Be at the main gate of
Juhu Aviation at 5 o'clock.

59:25.709 --> 59:27.126
Prakash, what is
the plan of action?

59:27.209 --> 59:28.876
People are working on it. But until
we don't have a breakthrough…

59:28.959 --> 59:31.459
… we have to do what he says.

59:32.001 --> 59:36.084
This is ridiculous! Law and order
have become mere spectators.

59:38.251 --> 59:40.042
Prakash, why aren't we able
to do anything about it?

59:40.209 --> 59:41.376
We have such a big force, we have
the intelligence bureau…

59:41.459 --> 59:43.167
… we have RAW and the ATS.

59:44.751 --> 59:46.626
Why do we always become
so helpless?

59:48.167 --> 59:51.042
We can't involve the media
or sound an alert.

59:51.584 --> 59:54.542
I just can't believe this.
We have become just useless.

59:54.751 --> 59:56.251
Sir, we are doing our best.

59:56.292 --> 59:58.417
But your best isn't good enough.

1:00:00.126 --> 1:00:01.917
I think we should call
in the army and the…

1:00:01.959 --> 1:00:03.084
They won't be of any help.

1:00:03.167 --> 1:00:04.542
Sir!
- Tell me.

1:00:05.334 --> 1:00:08.876
I have heard that man. I think what
Mr. Prakash is doing is right.

1:00:09.292 --> 1:00:12.251
Instead of questioning his decisions,
it would be better if we help him.

1:00:12.584 --> 1:00:15.001
And he is competent to
deal with this crisis.

1:00:17.459 --> 1:00:19.459
Which two officers are going
to accompany them?

1:00:19.917 --> 1:00:21.626
Arif Khan and Jai Singh.

1:00:21.667 --> 1:00:25.126
Prakash, you have senior
experienced officers and you are…

1:00:25.209 --> 1:00:27.501
You have Solanki…
- Please, trust me.

1:00:28.959 --> 1:00:31.709
Prakash, there should not be any
bomb blasts in Mumbai today.

1:00:31.834 --> 1:00:32.959
There won't be any bomb blasts.

1:00:33.001 --> 1:00:34.751
I don't want to hand over
the four men to him.

1:00:34.834 --> 1:00:35.959
That I will try.

1:00:36.917 --> 1:00:39.126
Excuse me. Yes, tell me.

1:00:40.459 --> 1:00:41.501
Ok.

1:00:50.001 --> 1:00:51.542
Sir, the Borivali address is wrong.

1:00:51.626 --> 1:00:52.709
There is no such building
with that name.

1:00:52.834 --> 1:00:54.376
Where is Arif?
- He is at the armory.

1:01:03.126 --> 1:01:05.417
Whose face did you
see first when you woke up?

1:01:05.709 --> 1:01:06.876
My own.

1:01:07.084 --> 1:01:08.542
I am not surprised.

1:01:09.251 --> 1:01:11.251
Are you ready?
- Yes sir!

1:01:24.501 --> 1:01:26.459
From here, you will go
directly to TS Mills.

1:01:26.959 --> 1:01:29.084
The four men will be handed
over to you over there.

1:01:29.584 --> 1:01:32.917
Special Task Force is picking them up
from their current locations.

1:01:33.251 --> 1:01:34.376
Here are the transfer orders.

1:01:43.417 --> 1:01:47.209
Ibrahim Khan.
- Let's go.

1:03:12.917 --> 1:03:14.084
He will make a conference call.

1:03:14.584 --> 1:03:16.084
There is a loudspeaker
facility in this phone.

1:03:16.417 --> 1:03:18.251
You can listen to our conversation.

1:03:18.751 --> 1:03:20.876
There are three routes
to reach Juhu Aviation.

1:03:21.084 --> 1:03:23.376
You will take the quickest one
which is by the highway.

1:03:23.501 --> 1:03:28.417
There will also be a driver who will
drop all of you there. - Yes sir!

1:03:28.542 --> 1:03:30.417
I don't think they will
make a rescue attempt.

1:03:30.542 --> 1:03:32.626
Neither do I think they will
risk a public shootout.

1:03:32.709 --> 1:03:34.501
There is danger to their
lives in doing it.

1:03:34.792 --> 1:03:36.876
This is not a pre-planned
operation. It's an extempore!

1:03:37.417 --> 1:03:41.084
So, that's it, guys. Just keep
your cool. All the best.

1:03:41.709 --> 1:03:44.084
And come over to my place in the
evening. We'll have a drink together.

1:03:45.042 --> 1:03:46.126
Sir!
- Right Sir

1:03:54.667 --> 1:03:55.584
Jai!

1:04:00.709 --> 1:04:01.667
Sir.

1:04:02.459 --> 1:04:04.459
After everything is over,
maybe you have to…

1:04:05.501 --> 1:04:06.876
… do something… about Arif.

1:04:11.501 --> 1:04:12.959
You know what I mean.

1:04:13.167 --> 1:04:14.251
Understood, sir.

1:04:26.417 --> 1:04:27.667
Who is this kid?

1:04:27.876 --> 1:04:29.542
Sir, his name is Anuj.
He is a hacker.

1:04:30.042 --> 1:04:32.501
He helps us very often
to crack cyber crimes.

1:04:33.292 --> 1:04:34.376
Is he that qualified?

1:04:34.501 --> 1:04:36.792
He is a college drop out but…
- Anuj!

1:04:40.167 --> 1:04:42.917
Do you understand what this equipment
and this setup is all about?

1:04:43.459 --> 1:04:45.834
No, sir. All this equipment
is outdated.

1:04:46.126 --> 1:04:49.251
You are still using NCC
3423 models while…

1:04:49.334 --> 1:04:51.917
… the S-series has been launched
three months back.

1:04:52.292 --> 1:04:54.376
I need some time.

1:04:54.459 --> 1:04:55.584
Can you handle it?

1:04:56.959 --> 1:04:59.751
Hey babe! Yes, I am running
a little late, honey!

1:05:00.709 --> 1:05:01.834
Will catch you in half an hour!

1:05:02.792 --> 1:05:04.792
Okay. Love you. See you.

1:05:07.292 --> 1:05:09.584
Women! Sorry, what were you saying?

1:05:09.751 --> 1:05:10.834
Can you handle the job?

1:05:11.542 --> 1:05:13.667
Definitely. I am a
drop out by choice.

1:05:52.792 --> 1:05:54.876
Hello.
- Okay sir.

1:07:16.667 --> 1:07:17.751
Yes sir.

1:07:18.751 --> 1:07:20.292
Get in touch with Chouhan.
Send this sketch to…

1:07:20.376 --> 1:07:23.334
… every police station and every
agency by fax or email.

1:07:23.417 --> 1:07:25.501
Next check our records. And
then get in touch with…

1:07:25.584 --> 1:07:29.001
… the Interpol and the FBI.
I want any information on this man.

1:07:29.084 --> 1:07:31.001
Yes sir. - Babu, wait here
for the verification.

1:07:38.001 --> 1:07:39.459
Sir.
- What is the status?

1:07:39.792 --> 1:07:40.917
We are on schedule.

1:07:41.001 --> 1:07:42.459
Any problem?
- Not at all, sir.

1:07:43.042 --> 1:07:45.209
Call me up when you reach there.
- Yes sir.

1:07:59.876 --> 1:08:02.917
What is your name?
- I don't need to tell you.

1:08:05.001 --> 1:08:06.126
You are right.

1:08:09.501 --> 1:08:10.876
My friend!
- What?

1:08:11.001 --> 1:08:14.292
What do you think
is happening to us?

1:08:17.417 --> 1:08:21.376
Brother Ibrahim, looking at
their scared faces…

1:08:21.542 --> 1:08:22.792
… I feel we are going to get freed.

1:08:23.667 --> 1:08:25.792
Even I think that we are…

1:08:35.209 --> 1:08:38.876
Fire! It reminds me of my youth.

1:08:39.876 --> 1:08:46.834
I was also like you. Too stubborn
to be afraid of death.

1:08:50.834 --> 1:08:54.917
I was six years old when my father
got into an enmity with a few men.

1:08:56.459 --> 1:08:59.251
Three men kidnapped
me from the school.

1:08:59.959 --> 1:09:01.334
They asked for a ransom
in exchange of my life.

1:09:02.126 --> 1:09:06.542
My father paid the ransom.
But they were still greedy.

1:09:07.251 --> 1:09:11.667
They beat me up. I was almost dead.

1:09:14.167 --> 1:09:17.751
When they got tired they tied a rope
to my leg and hung me on a tree.

1:09:18.417 --> 1:09:20.667
I called out to them. One
of them looked back.

1:09:20.959 --> 1:09:25.209
I screamed that if you have to then
at least hang me to a mango tree.

1:09:27.751 --> 1:09:31.626
He started to laugh.
He got me down…

1:09:32.584 --> 1:09:35.209
… patted me on my head
and sent me home.

1:09:36.584 --> 1:09:37.709
I lived.

1:09:39.584 --> 1:09:43.959
Four years later I killed them by
hanging them to the same tree.

1:09:53.334 --> 1:09:54.751
Can we kill this guy right here?

1:10:24.959 --> 1:10:26.084
Yes!

1:10:27.626 --> 1:10:28.751
We are on our way.

1:10:29.126 --> 1:10:30.251
Where are you?

1:10:30.334 --> 1:10:32.001
At the railway station and about
to the catch the train.

1:10:32.917 --> 1:10:37.042
I don't know why but there is too
much checking at the stations.

1:10:37.167 --> 1:10:39.709
It's just a drill. How is Kajal?

1:10:40.292 --> 1:10:44.459
Kajal is crying. Where are you?
- I am outdoors.

1:10:46.251 --> 1:10:48.626
We will reach home before you.

1:10:50.417 --> 1:10:52.792
Okay.
- I will hang up now.

1:10:53.751 --> 1:10:56.251
Anu…
- I love you too.

1:10:56.876 --> 1:10:59.709
I will call you when I get home.
Okay? Bye.

1:11:00.834 --> 1:11:01.917
Bye.

1:12:30.709 --> 1:12:31.834
Come on!

1:12:34.709 --> 1:12:35.834
Come on!

1:12:41.417 --> 1:12:42.501
Arif…
- Yes sir.

1:12:43.501 --> 1:12:44.626
Sir, we are there.

1:12:44.709 --> 1:12:45.834
Stay put. I will call back.

1:12:51.459 --> 1:12:52.584
Stand properly.

1:13:20.209 --> 1:13:21.751
Hello.
- Mr. Rathod.

1:13:22.709 --> 1:13:23.834
Did they reach there?

1:13:23.917 --> 1:13:25.167
Yes.

1:13:25.334 --> 1:13:26.667
I would like to speak to them.

1:13:33.501 --> 1:13:36.126
What is the name of your officer?
- Arif Khan.

1:13:41.834 --> 1:13:45.251
What happened?
- Nothing.

1:13:51.751 --> 1:13:53.292
Hello. - Arif, put the phone
on loudspeaker mode…

1:13:53.376 --> 1:13:55.459
… someone wants to speak to you.
- Yes sir.

1:13:57.542 --> 1:13:58.959
Arif is on the line. Speak to him.

1:13:59.459 --> 1:14:03.251
Arif, I want to speak to my friends.

1:14:05.876 --> 1:14:07.126
They are listening. Speak up.

1:14:07.792 --> 1:14:10.042
Greetings Mr. Khan.
- Greetings to you.

1:14:10.709 --> 1:14:12.501
Are you safe?
- Yes I am.

1:14:13.001 --> 1:14:21.167
I have been ordered to find out you
guys are real and not imposters.

1:14:21.417 --> 1:14:24.542
And to find if the police has not
hatched a conspiracy to fool us.

1:14:24.876 --> 1:14:26.001
That's why you will tell me…

1:14:26.084 --> 1:14:28.417
… your name and your
initials one by one.

1:14:29.459 --> 1:14:31.751
No need to go into the details.
Just a hint will do.

1:14:33.751 --> 1:14:37.042
Ibrahim Khan. Mumbai 93.
I am proud.

1:14:39.042 --> 1:14:42.167
Iqlak Ahmed. Gujarat
2002. I am proud.

1:14:43.126 --> 1:14:47.292
Mohammad Zaheer. Mumbai
2006. I am proud.

1:14:48.167 --> 1:14:51.167
Khursheed Lala. 92 to
2006. I am proud.

1:14:52.709 --> 1:14:54.667
Your initials are indeed wonderful.

1:14:55.792 --> 1:14:59.292
Arif, put the phone on handset
mode and give it to Khan.

1:15:04.209 --> 1:15:07.251
Hello. - Mr. Khan, did they
give you any injection…

1:15:07.334 --> 1:15:11.251
… or did they make
you eat anything?

1:15:11.334 --> 1:15:13.126
No. Just that we are handcuffed.

1:15:13.292 --> 1:15:18.001
They will be unlocked soon.
Give the phone back to the officer.

1:15:21.917 --> 1:15:23.167
Speak up.

1:15:23.251 --> 1:15:25.626
Arif, there are two
benches ahead of you.

1:15:28.667 --> 1:15:29.792
You will leave my four
men over there.

1:15:30.709 --> 1:15:33.292
You will free their hands
and without looking back…

1:15:33.376 --> 1:15:36.167
… you and your friend will
walk away from there.

1:15:36.501 --> 1:15:39.251
You will get in your van and
go back to the police station.

1:15:40.292 --> 1:15:42.667
You have only ten minutes,
starting now.

1:15:42.959 --> 1:15:44.751
I don't have to remind you that
if you do something foolish…

1:15:44.834 --> 1:15:46.917
… then thousands of
lives will be lost.

1:15:49.667 --> 1:15:52.042
Mr. Rathod, I will call you
after Arif leaves and…

1:15:52.126 --> 1:15:56.167
… give you the exact
locations of the bombs.

1:15:59.001 --> 1:16:00.126
Do as he says.

1:16:01.542 --> 1:16:02.667
Yes sir.

1:16:45.334 --> 1:16:46.584
FBI, Interpol or our Intelligence…

1:16:46.751 --> 1:16:49.126
Neither of them have any
information about this man.

1:16:49.542 --> 1:16:52.001
We have no choice. We can kill
these guys some other time.

1:16:54.626 --> 1:16:57.042
Prakash, how can we justify
their disappearance?

1:16:57.959 --> 1:16:59.542
There was a snag in the
security so they escaped.

1:16:59.959 --> 1:17:01.084
You can suspend me over this.

1:17:01.501 --> 1:17:04.542
Prakash, you are… - Excuse
me sir. It was a local call.

1:17:04.959 --> 1:17:07.626
If he calls the next time I can
point out his exact location.

1:17:08.126 --> 1:17:08.876
Are you sure?

1:17:08.917 --> 1:17:11.459
Definitely sir. He is good.
But not the best.

1:17:12.709 --> 1:17:13.792
Okay.

1:17:18.126 --> 1:17:20.501
Arif. - Careful…
- Remove his handcuffs.

1:17:21.376 --> 1:17:22.834
This is not right.
If they escape and…

1:17:22.959 --> 1:17:24.834
… they don't tell us about
the bombs then…

1:17:25.501 --> 1:17:27.042
Arif, it's Mr. Rathod's orders.

1:17:27.501 --> 1:17:31.209
No Jai. Free the other three.
Let's take him with us.

1:17:31.292 --> 1:17:32.501
We will leave him
only when we know…

1:17:32.584 --> 1:17:33.959
… the exact locations of the bombs.

1:17:34.042 --> 1:17:35.126
I will call up Mr. Rathod.

1:17:35.376 --> 1:17:37.292
I will not release him
even if sir asks me to.

1:17:37.459 --> 1:17:39.917
Arif, are you crazy? Someone
might be watching us.

1:17:40.001 --> 1:17:41.459
Then he will call us when
he sees us leave.

1:17:41.501 --> 1:17:44.001
Arif!
- Don't argue! Let's go!

1:17:44.084 --> 1:17:46.501
Arif!
- You are making a mistake.

1:17:46.917 --> 1:17:48.167
What did you say?

1:17:48.251 --> 1:17:49.376
You are making a big mistake.

1:17:49.459 --> 1:17:50.501
I like to make mistakes.

1:17:56.501 --> 1:17:57.751
Come on!
- I'm going.

1:18:03.292 --> 1:18:04.459
What will they do to
brother Ibrahim?

1:18:04.959 --> 1:18:06.917
Nothing. We will get
him freed later.

1:18:07.584 --> 1:18:08.709
Brother Khursheed, what
should we do next?

1:18:09.417 --> 1:18:11.751
We will wait. Someone will
come to take us away.

1:18:30.501 --> 1:18:31.876
Arif!
- What is it now?

1:18:32.334 --> 1:18:33.459
I can hear a phone ringing.

1:18:37.376 --> 1:18:38.459
Take a look.

1:18:51.376 --> 1:18:52.459
Pick it up.

1:19:13.167 --> 1:19:16.042
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!

1:19:24.209 --> 1:19:26.584
Let me go! Let me go! Wait!

1:19:40.042 --> 1:19:41.751
Take him.

1:19:58.584 --> 1:20:00.334
Now give me the locations
of the bombs.

1:20:00.584 --> 1:20:03.292
First call up Arif and
give me his status.

1:20:03.376 --> 1:20:04.501
I want to listen to his response.

1:20:07.667 --> 1:20:10.542
Hold him. Hello.

1:20:10.626 --> 1:20:11.751
Arif, what is the progress?

1:20:12.084 --> 1:20:14.334
Sir, I am confused. Something
else is going on here.

1:20:14.792 --> 1:20:17.584
Means? - The plan was not to
free them but to kill them.

1:20:18.084 --> 1:20:19.501
A bomb was planted in that area.

1:20:19.792 --> 1:20:22.709
As soon as we left,
the bomb exploded.

1:20:23.084 --> 1:20:24.209
Both the benches were rigged.

1:20:26.626 --> 1:20:27.751
It means, all four of them…

1:20:27.917 --> 1:20:31.292
No. I had left only Zaheer,
Iqlak and Lala over there.

1:20:33.501 --> 1:20:35.709
To secure the information
about the bombs…

1:20:35.792 --> 1:20:37.084
… I had kept Ibrahim with me.

1:20:39.334 --> 1:20:41.001
Yes he is with us. He is alive.

1:20:50.709 --> 1:20:51.834
What is happening?

1:20:51.876 --> 1:20:53.209
Arif is right, Mr. Rathod!

1:20:54.626 --> 1:20:58.042
Arif, put the phone
of loudspeaker mode.

1:20:58.126 --> 1:21:00.126
I want Ibrahim to listen to
what I am going to say.

1:21:10.542 --> 1:21:13.417
I did not want to save Ibrahim
Khan, Iqlak Ahmed…

1:21:13.501 --> 1:21:15.501
… Mohammad Zaheer and
Khursheed Lala but…

1:21:15.542 --> 1:21:16.792
… I wanted to kill them.

1:21:19.626 --> 1:21:23.042
And in fact you will complete
my job, today and right now.

1:21:26.542 --> 1:21:27.667
Sorry, I did not understand you.

1:21:27.959 --> 1:21:30.501
Mr. Rathod, what do you do if
a cockroach enters you house?

1:21:31.167 --> 1:21:32.792
You do not make it your pet,
you just kill it.

1:21:34.251 --> 1:21:37.751
These pests were spoiling my house
and now I want to clean it.

1:21:41.501 --> 1:21:42.209
Who are you?

1:21:42.251 --> 1:21:44.626
I am someone who is afraid to get
into a bus or a train these days.

1:21:47.834 --> 1:21:50.876
I am someone whose wife
thinks is going to war…

1:21:50.959 --> 1:21:53.292
… while I am actually
going to my work.

1:21:53.709 --> 1:21:54.876
She is afraid that I may not return.

1:21:56.001 --> 1:21:57.917
She calls up every two hours.
To find if I had my tea.

1:21:58.001 --> 1:21:59.126
To find if I have lunched.

1:22:00.376 --> 1:22:02.834
Actually she wants to find out
whether I am still alive.

1:22:05.292 --> 1:22:09.167
I am someone who sometimes gets
stuck in the rain or in the blasts.

1:22:11.251 --> 1:22:13.792
I am someone who suspects the
person carrying a rosary.

1:22:13.876 --> 1:22:16.917
I am also the one who is afraid
to grow his beard and wear a cap.

1:22:18.042 --> 1:22:21.084
If I buy a shop I am afraid
to choose a name as…

1:22:21.167 --> 1:22:24.584
… someone might see the name
and burn it during the riots.

1:22:27.251 --> 1:22:28.417
No matter which two parties
are fighting…

1:22:28.501 --> 1:22:30.501
… I am the first one to get killed.

1:22:34.084 --> 1:22:38.334
You must have seen a crowd.
Choose a person from it.

1:22:39.376 --> 1:22:40.209
I am that person.

1:22:41.334 --> 1:22:46.667
I am just the stupid common man
wanting to clean his house.

1:22:47.167 --> 1:22:49.334
How did this stupid common
man suddenly wake up?

1:22:50.292 --> 1:22:52.376
And that too with
six kilograms of RDX?

1:22:52.876 --> 1:22:54.167
Has that got you worried now?

1:22:55.834 --> 1:22:57.834
Do you want me to live my life
and die every moment of it?

1:23:00.417 --> 1:23:02.001
Mr. Rathod, this did not
happen all of a sudden!

1:23:02.292 --> 1:23:03.792
I just did not get
the time to do it.

1:23:05.917 --> 1:23:08.917
In the process of earning my daily
bread this work got neglected.

1:23:09.001 --> 1:23:10.417
But it's better late than never.

1:23:11.626 --> 1:23:13.709
That remaining cockroach
will also die today.

1:23:13.876 --> 1:23:15.792
Why just these four? There
are others as well.

1:23:16.876 --> 1:23:19.126
I drew a lottery and
I got their names.

1:23:19.834 --> 1:23:22.542
Are you trying to say that
if we don't kill Ibrahim…

1:23:22.626 --> 1:23:25.959
… then you will kill thousands
of innocent people?

1:23:26.251 --> 1:23:28.792
Sooner or later they are
going to die and…

1:23:28.876 --> 1:23:31.834
… people like Ibrahim
will kill them.

1:23:33.542 --> 1:23:35.042
The last time they were
killed in a train…

1:23:35.126 --> 1:23:36.709
… this time it will
be somewhere else.

1:23:38.084 --> 1:23:40.917
They will keep on killing until
we learn to give a solid reply.

1:23:41.709 --> 1:23:44.334
Who are you?
- What do you mean?

1:23:44.501 --> 1:23:46.501
I mean are you a Hindu or a Muslim?

1:23:48.126 --> 1:23:50.584
This has nothing to
do with my religion.

1:23:50.709 --> 1:23:52.001
There is.

1:23:52.667 --> 1:23:56.501
I told you, I am just
the stupid common man.

1:23:56.751 --> 1:23:58.917
Stupid common man!
- Right.

1:23:59.959 --> 1:24:02.667
Are you afraid of getting
caught and getting killed?

1:24:05.084 --> 1:24:06.251
Maybe.

1:24:06.334 --> 1:24:08.334
Be definite. You are or you aren't?
- I am.

1:24:08.501 --> 1:24:10.501
Just remember this fear.
And don't think you will…

1:24:10.542 --> 1:24:13.501
… escape punishment by putting this
garb of a stupid common man.

1:24:13.876 --> 1:24:14.959
The thing you are trying to prove…

1:24:15.042 --> 1:24:16.501
I am not trying to prove anything.

1:24:16.626 --> 1:24:21.834
I just want to remind you
that people are very angry.

1:24:21.959 --> 1:24:23.626
Please stop testing their patience.

1:24:25.084 --> 1:24:28.959
We are resilient by
force not by choice.

1:24:30.292 --> 1:24:32.667
It took me just four weeks
to render you helpless.

1:24:35.084 --> 1:24:37.959
Do you suppose the people who kill
us are more intelligent than us?

1:24:38.876 --> 1:24:41.709
Type 'bomb' in any internet
search and you will get…

1:24:41.792 --> 1:24:45.959
… hundreds of websites showing
you how to make them.

1:24:46.167 --> 1:24:48.917
All the information is accessible
and that too for free.

1:24:50.917 --> 1:24:54.126
Do you know a washing soap
is also a potential bomb?

1:24:56.542 --> 1:25:01.209
I feel there is no better product
made for the common man.

1:25:02.834 --> 1:25:06.334
The problem with us is that
we get used to all this.

1:25:08.626 --> 1:25:11.084
If one such incidence occurs we
watch it on all the channels…

1:25:11.167 --> 1:25:13.167
… we send SMS, we call up people.

1:25:13.542 --> 1:25:15.251
We get happy that we
are safe and then…

1:25:15.334 --> 1:25:19.501
… instead of fighting against the
situation we start to adjust with it.

1:25:21.584 --> 1:25:26.459
But we have our compulsions.
We have to maintain a family.

1:25:28.792 --> 1:25:32.751
That's why we appoint a government
to run the nation.

1:25:34.084 --> 1:25:38.167
All of you. The government,
the police force, intelligence…

1:25:38.251 --> 1:25:41.376
… is capable of carrying
out this pest control.

1:25:41.626 --> 1:25:42.751
But you are not doing it. Instead
you are just supporting their…

1:25:42.834 --> 1:25:44.251
… cause by not doing
anything stringent.

1:25:47.376 --> 1:25:49.251
Why are you not nipping
them in the bud?

1:25:50.959 --> 1:25:54.292
It takes you ten years to
prove a person guilty.

1:25:54.667 --> 1:25:57.292
Don't you think this is a question
mark on your ability?

1:25:59.751 --> 1:26:03.834
All this should stop. This whole
lousy system is flawed.

1:26:07.001 --> 1:26:08.376
If you don't clean up
this mess then…

1:26:08.459 --> 1:26:10.292
… we will have to do
something about it.

1:26:11.792 --> 1:26:15.959
I know there will be an imbalance
in our civilized society.

1:26:16.001 --> 1:26:17.126
But what can we do?

1:26:18.459 --> 1:26:21.917
Mr. Rathod, I am convinced the
train blasts were not just…

1:26:22.001 --> 1:26:24.334
… a terrorist activity
but it was a question.

1:26:25.917 --> 1:26:28.167
The question was, we are going
to keep killing you…

1:26:28.251 --> 1:26:30.001
… what can you do? Yes!

1:26:31.001 --> 1:26:32.126
They've asked us this question.

1:26:33.751 --> 1:26:37.042
On a Friday, repeated it on Tuesday.

1:26:37.126 --> 1:26:39.459
I am just replying on Wednesday.

1:26:41.084 --> 1:26:44.084
Your, add-salt-to-taste philosophy,
is absolutely wrong.

1:26:44.751 --> 1:26:45.876
This is not the correct approach.

1:26:45.959 --> 1:26:47.959
I know. But right now
I am not concerned…

1:26:48.042 --> 1:26:49.917
… about the approach
but the results.

1:26:50.459 --> 1:26:52.834
Did someone of yours
die in these blasts?

1:26:53.167 --> 1:26:56.042
Why? Should I wait until
someone close to me dies…

1:26:56.126 --> 1:26:58.292
… in such a dirty way?

1:26:58.376 --> 1:27:00.751
And only then will you feel that
this step is justified?

1:27:05.667 --> 1:27:07.001
If you want to know then listen.

1:27:08.709 --> 1:27:12.501
There was someone close
to me on that train.

1:27:16.626 --> 1:27:17.876
A kid… must be around 21 years.

1:27:20.709 --> 1:27:21.834
Don't know his name.

1:27:23.959 --> 1:27:25.459
Used to meet me everyday in
the first class compartment.

1:27:28.501 --> 1:27:31.709
While getting into the train he
used to greet me with a hello…

1:27:31.792 --> 1:27:34.501
… and I used to return the courtesy.

1:27:34.876 --> 1:27:36.167
There were many such people.

1:27:37.667 --> 1:27:39.001
We did not know each
other's names…

1:27:39.084 --> 1:27:40.334
… Just knew each other
through 'hellos!'

1:27:42.126 --> 1:27:43.251
With a smile he had shown me…

1:27:43.459 --> 1:27:46.001
… his engagement ring
just a day before.

1:27:56.792 --> 1:27:58.042
He was very happy.

1:28:01.917 --> 1:28:04.042
The next day I missed the
train and I escaped death.

1:28:05.501 --> 1:28:06.626
But he didn't.

1:28:08.584 --> 1:28:09.709
After that when I went by train…

1:28:09.751 --> 1:28:11.209
… there was nobody whom I knew.

1:28:12.667 --> 1:28:13.792
The compartment was
full of strangers.

1:28:24.126 --> 1:28:26.167
So you are doing this
for those dead people.

1:28:26.459 --> 1:28:31.084
No. I am not that emotional
and sentimental.

1:28:32.209 --> 1:28:40.959
I always knew what loss is.
I have seen my relatives die.

1:28:41.459 --> 1:28:46.209
But this is unacceptable.

1:28:49.167 --> 1:28:51.917
None of these… pardon
my language…

1:28:52.959 --> 1:28:57.209
But none of these idiots will
decide when I should die.

1:28:59.584 --> 1:29:04.459
They are proud of 1992
and 1993 and of 2006.

1:29:06.292 --> 1:29:09.542
They are proud of Gujarat, Mumbai,
Delhi and Malegoan.

1:29:09.626 --> 1:29:12.459
I am proud of myself that
I am killing such people.

1:29:15.251 --> 1:29:16.751
I am not a saviour.

1:29:16.834 --> 1:29:18.834
And I am not doing this for
anyone else but myself.

1:29:21.084 --> 1:29:24.209
I only want that when my child
goes out he should…

1:29:24.292 --> 1:29:27.667
… travel without fear on buses,
trains or anywhere else.

1:29:28.459 --> 1:29:29.709
I cannot understand you.

1:29:29.792 --> 1:29:35.084
That's because my reasons and
demands are a bit strange.

1:29:37.126 --> 1:29:38.251
Maybe.

1:29:38.292 --> 1:29:39.459
Be definite. Yes or no.

1:29:41.917 --> 1:29:43.042
Yes.

1:29:44.126 --> 1:29:46.417
If they kill 200 of
us then it is okay…

1:29:46.501 --> 1:29:49.876
… but if I kill only 4 of
them then it's strange?

1:29:52.626 --> 1:29:53.792
This is not your fault.

1:29:54.501 --> 1:29:56.417
This is what is expected
of a common man.

1:29:56.501 --> 1:30:01.042
Live, tolerate and die
like a common man.

1:30:03.001 --> 1:30:06.209
Take yourself for example till the
time you did not know who I am…

1:30:06.292 --> 1:30:09.792
… you were afraid of me
and taking me seriously.

1:30:09.876 --> 1:30:11.417
And now that I have told
you I am a common man…

1:30:11.501 --> 1:30:14.459
… you've got back some
confidence in your voice.

1:30:14.501 --> 1:30:17.626
You must be thinking he is
not a terrorist but…

1:30:17.751 --> 1:30:19.751
… just a common man.
I will easily catch him.

1:30:20.042 --> 1:30:21.167
No, that is not so.

1:30:21.251 --> 1:30:25.417
It better not be because all the
bombs are still where they were.

1:30:26.001 --> 1:30:27.376
Mr. Rathod. Arif.

1:30:28.001 --> 1:30:29.126
Now everything depends on you two…

1:30:29.209 --> 1:30:31.501
… whether this would be
my last call or not.

1:30:34.876 --> 1:30:38.417
Ten minutes later Naina Roy will
reach there with her cameraman.

1:30:39.251 --> 1:30:41.417
There will also be a doctor
and an ambulance with them.

1:30:41.959 --> 1:30:45.792
I want confirmed reports on
TV that Ibrahim Khan is dead.

1:30:47.792 --> 1:30:49.959
If this happens then
I will immediately…

1:30:50.042 --> 1:30:51.459
… tell you where the bombs are.

1:30:53.501 --> 1:30:57.001
But if it doesn't then you are
responsible for what happens next.

1:31:07.042 --> 1:31:09.792
Arif, I'll call you back.
- Yes sir.

1:31:15.792 --> 1:31:16.959
Now what will you do?

1:31:18.376 --> 1:31:21.126
First, I will clean my ear.
I am finding it hard to hear.

1:31:23.292 --> 1:31:24.959
Sir, I want you to
take this decision.

1:31:29.584 --> 1:31:32.251
Do we have any other choice
than to do what he says?

1:31:34.084 --> 1:31:35.209
No sir.

1:31:35.876 --> 1:31:38.959
But it is wrong.
- That it is.

1:31:42.501 --> 1:31:43.584
What else can I do?

1:31:44.751 --> 1:31:45.876
We can do nothing.

1:31:50.626 --> 1:31:51.751
What is all this?

1:31:51.876 --> 1:31:53.417
Child, what is 2 plus 2?

1:31:54.126 --> 1:31:55.251
What?

1:31:55.334 --> 1:31:58.667
Ten minutes from now you will
go to runway number 4 and…

1:31:58.792 --> 1:32:00.626
… cover a very important news.

1:32:02.667 --> 1:32:03.917
Didn't I promise this would be…

1:32:04.001 --> 1:32:06.292
… the most important
day of your life?

1:32:08.167 --> 1:32:09.417
Go see for yourself.

1:32:09.959 --> 1:32:11.959
Did you just address me as a child?

1:32:12.167 --> 1:32:14.334
You have heard right. Bye.

1:32:19.959 --> 1:32:23.251
He is a traitor! He knows nothing.

1:32:23.792 --> 1:32:26.959
The matter is about our community.
Yours and mine.

1:32:27.501 --> 1:32:29.334
It is about my brothers
and sisters and our home.

1:32:30.001 --> 1:32:34.959
It is about our rights! If we are
together nobody can harm us.

1:32:36.001 --> 1:32:38.126
Didn't we teach the Americans
and British a very good lesson?

1:32:38.667 --> 1:32:39.792
Nobody could stop us.

1:32:39.959 --> 1:32:41.501
But you made a mistake
by coming to India.

1:32:42.876 --> 1:32:44.626
A common man got a
bit upset and now…

1:32:44.709 --> 1:32:47.584
… not only is he stopping you
but he is killing you as well.

1:32:47.667 --> 1:32:48.792
I am not afraid to die…

1:32:52.501 --> 1:32:55.751
I do not fear death.
Why am I alive?

1:32:56.626 --> 1:32:57.709
For a cause.

1:32:58.084 --> 1:33:00.667
And for that cause, I am willing
to sacrifice myself.

1:33:02.292 --> 1:33:07.626
But then I want to live
to wage this battle.

1:33:08.459 --> 1:33:11.459
And for my brothers and sisters,
my community…

1:33:14.376 --> 1:33:15.459
Why are you laughing?

1:33:16.292 --> 1:33:18.334
I see that you are afraid of death.

1:33:20.751 --> 1:33:24.292
This is an accident.
- Yes sir, this is an accident.

1:33:26.251 --> 1:33:29.376
I must get a detailed report of
this accident by tomorrow morning.

1:33:30.417 --> 1:33:31.501
Personally.

1:33:32.084 --> 1:33:33.167
You will get it.

1:33:50.376 --> 1:33:51.667
Sir!
- Heads!

1:33:53.417 --> 1:33:54.501
Yes sir.

1:34:17.626 --> 1:34:18.751
You should've told me first.

1:34:19.126 --> 1:34:20.501
We don't have time. Look over there.

1:34:38.751 --> 1:34:40.917
Did you trace the call?
- I am tracing it.

1:34:50.751 --> 1:34:55.917
Sir, let him go. I was wrong.
He's not just good. He is the best.

1:35:03.917 --> 1:35:07.376
Sir, I am not sure this is the man… but…

1:35:08.042 --> 1:35:09.251
How similar is he?

1:35:10.042 --> 1:35:14.626
I can… - Is he at least
one percent similar? Sir…

1:36:00.042 --> 1:36:01.167
Give me the keys.

1:36:10.459 --> 1:36:13.001
Deepak, right now, I am at the
Juhu Aviation Base where…

1:36:13.084 --> 1:36:18.917
… four terrorists were killed
while trying to escape.

1:36:19.167 --> 1:36:21.334
The names of these terrorists
are Khursheed Lala…

1:36:21.417 --> 1:36:24.459
… Iqlak Ahmed, Mohammad
Zaheer and Ibrahim Khan.

1:36:24.792 --> 1:36:25.959
For viewers…

1:36:37.917 --> 1:36:39.626
Mr. Rathod!
- Tell me.

1:36:40.084 --> 1:36:43.209
I did not plant any other bomb.

1:36:44.167 --> 1:36:46.334
I know that.
- Nice talking to you sir.

1:37:45.459 --> 1:37:49.167
In this operation a police inspector
has been seriously injured.

1:37:49.542 --> 1:37:50.834
His name is Arif Khan.

1:37:51.126 --> 1:37:53.167
You can see him right now
going into the ambulance.

1:37:53.376 --> 1:37:55.459
And now we have with us
Inspector Jai Singh who…

1:37:55.501 --> 1:37:57.834
… will give us all the information
about this incident.

1:37:58.626 --> 1:38:00.001
Sir, tell us how did this happen?

1:38:01.292 --> 1:38:03.751
As a routine process
we were shifting…

1:38:03.834 --> 1:38:06.792
… these terrorists to another place.

1:38:53.751 --> 1:38:55.542
Excuse me!
- Yes.

1:38:57.626 --> 1:39:00.334
What's the time?
My watch is not working.

1:39:01.667 --> 1:39:02.792
5.30.

1:39:03.709 --> 1:39:05.542
Your bag seems quite
heavy. Excuse me.

1:39:09.167 --> 1:39:10.334
Yes, tell me.

1:39:10.459 --> 1:39:11.792
Have you left or not?

1:39:11.959 --> 1:39:13.542
I was just leaving
when I met someone.

1:39:13.876 --> 1:39:15.459
Who is it? A friend of yours?

1:39:15.542 --> 1:39:16.667
I don't know yet.

1:39:16.751 --> 1:39:19.459
Please come home. It's getting
late. - I am on my way.

1:39:20.501 --> 1:39:23.417
Sorry. Were you saying something?

1:39:23.959 --> 1:39:25.751
I was saying your bag
seems quite heavy.

1:39:26.459 --> 1:39:28.459
Can I drop you somewhere?
That's my vehicle.

1:39:29.917 --> 1:39:31.167
That police jeep?

1:39:32.251 --> 1:39:35.459
Yes.
- No thanks. I live nearby.

1:39:36.251 --> 1:39:37.376
Are you sure?
- Sure.

1:39:44.376 --> 1:39:45.459
Prakash Rathod.

1:39:50.959 --> 1:39:52.084
I am…

1:39:54.042 --> 1:39:55.167
He told me his name…

1:39:55.251 --> 1:39:58.251
but I can't tell that
name to anybody…

1:39:59.292 --> 1:40:01.542
A man recognizes the
religion by name.

1:40:02.251 --> 1:40:04.751
We all knew that a common man
is disturbed by these things.

1:40:05.626 --> 1:40:10.292
But never ever imagined that a
common man can go to such stage.

1:40:11.334 --> 1:40:13.001
One common man had the guts.

1:40:14.042 --> 1:40:16.751
This incident and this case is
not registered in any file.

1:40:17.167 --> 1:40:20.417
There is no record anywhere,
but it is in my mind…

1:40:20.459 --> 1:40:24.876
… and some people who were involved
in this case unwillingly.

1:40:25.584 --> 1:40:27.584
I don't know whether
it is right or wrong…

1:40:28.459 --> 1:40:32.126
… but personally speaking,
whatever it was. It was good.
