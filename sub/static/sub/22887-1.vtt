WEBVTT

00:05.090 --> 00:06.890
In northern Vermont,

00:06.920 --> 00:08.860
so far north
that on clear days,

00:08.890 --> 00:11.190
you might be able
to see the North Pole,

00:11.230 --> 00:14.500
lies the magical town
of Evergreen.

00:14.530 --> 00:15.830
Some say it was the decorations

00:15.870 --> 00:18.570
that made this little town
so special,

00:18.600 --> 00:19.530
but others believed

00:19.570 --> 00:22.600
it was because
of something else entirely,

00:22.640 --> 00:25.670
something you wouldn't
expect at all....

00:25.710 --> 00:27.710
A snow globe...

00:27.740 --> 00:30.050
But this wasn't
just any snow globe.

00:30.080 --> 00:31.110
No, they say

00:31.150 --> 00:34.220
that if you shake
this one just so,

00:34.250 --> 00:35.450
and make one wish,

00:35.490 --> 00:37.290
the true wish of your heart,

00:37.320 --> 00:40.120
Christmas magic
will make it come true.

00:40.160 --> 00:42.460
Now, I know
what you're thinking.

00:42.490 --> 00:45.360
Could a snow globe
really grant wishes?

00:45.400 --> 00:48.060
Well, maybe the story
of Christmas in Evergreen

00:48.100 --> 00:50.270
will help you believe.

01:01.010 --> 01:03.480
Hey, everyone,
here we come!

01:03.510 --> 01:05.209
These guys have got
all their shots,

01:05.250 --> 01:06.926
and they're ready
for their first Christmas.

01:06.950 --> 01:08.650
Aw!

01:08.690 --> 01:11.050
I can't get over
how cute they are!

01:11.090 --> 01:12.720
How's our mama doing?

01:12.760 --> 01:14.620
Molly definitely has
her paws full

01:14.660 --> 01:16.460
with these guys.

01:16.490 --> 01:18.090
They sure are
going to miss you.

01:18.130 --> 01:20.160
Mm, I'm going to
miss them, too.

01:20.200 --> 01:21.746
I'm going to miss all
my furry patients.

01:21.770 --> 01:23.000
Wait a minute.

01:23.030 --> 01:24.830
You don't have
any furry patients in D.C.?

01:24.870 --> 01:25.770
No, I will,

01:25.800 --> 01:27.516
but I'm going to be
working in a big clinic.

01:27.540 --> 01:29.440
I don't know
if I'll have time

01:29.470 --> 01:30.840
for a pile of pugs.

01:30.870 --> 01:32.270
But aren't you going
to miss it?

01:33.610 --> 01:35.240
Of course I will,

01:35.280 --> 01:37.150
but this is
a big opportunity.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.310
I can't pass it up...

01:39.350 --> 01:41.450
And you have Dr. Myers' info
in Montpelier, right?

01:41.490 --> 01:42.650
Yup.

01:42.690 --> 01:43.650
He's great.

01:43.690 --> 01:46.420
Yes, he is,
but it's going to be different.

01:46.460 --> 01:47.790
I know,

01:47.820 --> 01:50.460
but different is good, right?

01:50.490 --> 01:51.506
Like, having a whole bunch
of puppies is different,

01:51.530 --> 01:53.330
and that's a
good thing, right?

01:53.360 --> 01:56.530
Yeah, I can't wait
to find these guys a new home.

01:56.570 --> 01:57.670
Bye, Allie.

01:57.700 --> 02:00.100
Now we've just got to find
a new home for you, Frank.

02:08.009 --> 02:09.080
Joe, she's here!

02:10.810 --> 02:11.780
Hi, honey.

02:11.820 --> 02:13.280
Oh, Allie!

02:14.650 --> 02:15.680
My baby!

02:15.720 --> 02:18.050
No, this is not goodbye.

02:18.090 --> 02:19.520
I'm just dropping off Frank.

02:19.560 --> 02:21.990
Besides, you promised
you wouldn't cry.

02:22.030 --> 02:23.690
I'm not!
I was just...

02:23.730 --> 02:24.590
Chopping onions.

02:24.630 --> 02:27.330
I'm going to be home
right after Christmas.

02:27.360 --> 02:28.600
Mm-hmm...

02:28.630 --> 02:30.176
And then you're going to be
leaving again right after that,

02:30.200 --> 02:31.170
for good,

02:31.200 --> 02:32.716
and all I'm going to
have to remember you by

02:32.740 --> 02:34.200
is the goldfish.

02:34.240 --> 02:34.970
Maybe I should, uh,

02:35.010 --> 02:37.510
just take care
of Frank, okay?

02:37.540 --> 02:38.540
Thanks.

02:40.510 --> 02:42.480
Washington, D.C.
has modern conveniences.

02:42.510 --> 02:43.480
I know.

02:43.510 --> 02:44.480
Phone.

02:44.510 --> 02:46.250
I know.

02:46.280 --> 02:47.780
I hear they even have
an airport now.

02:49.420 --> 02:52.550
Honey, I just want to make sure
that you're sure,

02:52.590 --> 02:54.690
'cause this is
a big change, Allie.

02:54.720 --> 02:55.690
I'm sure.

02:55.730 --> 02:57.160
It's a great job,

02:57.190 --> 02:59.330
and besides,
I'm ready for a change.

02:59.360 --> 03:01.700
And I'm not just talking
about just the job.

03:01.730 --> 03:03.230
No, mom, no.

03:03.270 --> 03:04.500
We've been over this.

03:04.530 --> 03:06.370
Spencer and I,
we're testing the waters.

03:06.400 --> 03:09.000
Mm-hmm, and there was a reason
that you two broke up, honey.

03:09.040 --> 03:10.370
Yeah!

03:10.410 --> 03:12.540
We couldn't handle
the long-distance thing,

03:12.580 --> 03:13.786
so now we're going
to be in the same city,

03:13.810 --> 03:15.840
and it's not a big deal.

03:15.880 --> 03:18.380
You're going to be spending
Christmas with him, Allie,

03:18.420 --> 03:21.220
and that is a very big deal.

03:22.790 --> 03:25.520
You're just hugging me right now
just to hush me up, aren't you?

03:25.560 --> 03:27.560
No, I'm hugging you
because I love you.

03:27.590 --> 03:29.020
The hushing

03:29.060 --> 03:30.430
is just a bonus.

03:33.760 --> 03:34.960
I've got to go.

03:35.000 --> 03:35.800
I love you.

03:35.830 --> 03:36.830
I love you.

04:02.160 --> 04:03.390
Oh!

04:03.430 --> 04:04.430
Oh, so sorry!

04:04.460 --> 04:06.460
In a hurry to get
your Christmas plans started?

04:06.500 --> 04:07.630
Yes.

04:07.660 --> 04:09.060
Just about to head
out of town.

04:09.100 --> 04:09.830
Well, be sure
to check the weather

04:09.870 --> 04:11.330
before you go
to the airport.

04:11.370 --> 04:14.170
Mother nature
can be unpredictable.

04:27.480 --> 04:28.350
Spencer!

04:28.390 --> 04:29.796
Hey, I was just heading
out the door.

04:29.820 --> 04:31.420
Happy "Moving to D.C. day!"

04:31.450 --> 04:33.020
Hey, it's not
Moving to D.C. day.

04:33.060 --> 04:34.420
It's "Coming to D.C."

04:34.460 --> 04:36.590
To sign the new lease
on my apartment day."

04:36.630 --> 04:38.330
I'm sorry,
do they make a card for that?

04:38.360 --> 04:40.030
They make a card
for everything.

04:40.060 --> 04:41.260
<i> I cannot believe</i>

04:41.300 --> 04:42.200
we are finally going
to be living

04:42.230 --> 04:43.300
in the same city together,

04:43.330 --> 04:45.530
<i>just five blocks apart.</i>

04:45.570 --> 04:48.000
Well, the commute
will definitely be a lot easier.

04:48.040 --> 04:49.186
<i>So, I've got
some incredible stuff</i>

04:49.210 --> 04:50.210
<i>lined up for us...</i>

04:50.240 --> 04:51.470
Dinners, parties...
Oh...

04:51.510 --> 04:53.880
And on Christmas day,

04:53.910 --> 04:54.880
you and I are going
to be going

04:54.910 --> 04:57.350
to my boss' swanky estate
out in the Hamptons.

04:57.380 --> 04:58.780
<i>One of the partners even said</i>

04:58.820 --> 05:00.496
<i>that we can use his helicopter
to get there.</i>

05:00.520 --> 05:02.480
A helicopter?

05:02.520 --> 05:03.420
Really?

05:03.450 --> 05:05.520
<i>Hey, you better
get used to it, okay?</i>

05:05.560 --> 05:06.620
<i>This is going to be</i>

05:06.660 --> 05:08.620
a brand-new start
for us, Allie.

05:08.660 --> 05:10.660
Right, and I'm excited
about that.

05:10.690 --> 05:11.630
I just want to make sure

05:11.660 --> 05:14.630
that we're not getting
ahead of ourselves.

05:14.660 --> 05:16.500
Allie, I get it.

05:16.530 --> 05:18.500
I totally get it, okay?

05:18.540 --> 05:20.700
I just want to put the last
couple of months behind us.

05:20.740 --> 05:21.970
I mean, this is Christmas.

05:22.010 --> 05:23.210
it's a time
for new beginnings.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.040
Absolutely...

05:25.080 --> 05:27.740
And, you know,
also...

05:27.780 --> 05:29.510
I love swanky parties.

05:29.550 --> 05:30.380
<i>Beautiful.</i>

05:30.410 --> 05:32.910
Um, I should
get back to work, though.

05:32.950 --> 05:34.720
I can't wait to see you tonight.

05:34.750 --> 05:36.180
All right.
I'll talk to you soon.

05:36.220 --> 05:37.090
<i>Okay.</i>

05:37.120 --> 05:38.620
Bye.

05:41.060 --> 05:42.360
I can do swanky.

05:47.860 --> 05:48.860
No...

05:52.540 --> 05:54.670
I've got to go. Christmas
calls.

05:54.700 --> 05:56.540
Okay, bye-bye.

05:58.540 --> 05:59.610
Sorry.

05:59.640 --> 06:01.410
Last work call,
i promise.

06:01.440 --> 06:02.880
You said that
after the last one...

06:02.910 --> 06:03.880
And the one
before that,

06:03.910 --> 06:05.910
and the one
before that,

06:05.950 --> 06:07.450
and...

06:07.480 --> 06:08.420
Oh, okay!

06:08.450 --> 06:12.450
Hey, Zoe, now I'm
officially on vacation.

06:12.490 --> 06:14.360
Just you and me
off to Florida

06:14.390 --> 06:15.890
and our big cruise
on Christmas day.

06:15.930 --> 06:17.360
Won't that be fun?

06:17.390 --> 06:19.460
Sure!
we can have fun in Florida.

06:19.500 --> 06:22.930
I mean, Christmas is supposed
to be cold with snow, but...

06:22.970 --> 06:24.430
According to who?

06:24.470 --> 06:25.600
Santa.

06:25.640 --> 06:27.300
That's why
he wears a suit.

06:27.340 --> 06:29.640
Oh, you know,
i didn't know that.

06:29.670 --> 06:31.570
But how about this?
I'll tell you what.

06:31.610 --> 06:33.040
When we get there,

06:33.080 --> 06:34.380
soon as we get
into our hotel,

06:34.410 --> 06:35.586
we will crank the
air conditioning up

06:35.610 --> 06:37.040
really high,

06:37.080 --> 06:38.950
uh, we'll fill
the pool with ice,

06:38.980 --> 06:41.650
and it'll be just like
living in the North Pole.

06:41.680 --> 06:43.850
Oh, dad...

06:50.330 --> 06:52.360
You could've
walked to D.C. by now.

06:53.760 --> 06:55.500
Don't we have
enough real snow?

06:55.530 --> 06:57.900
Oh, this is
for the Christmas festival.

06:57.930 --> 06:59.770
You know,
the one you're going to miss?

06:59.800 --> 07:00.640
Yes, I'm aware

07:00.670 --> 07:01.946
I'm missing the
Christmas festival.

07:01.970 --> 07:03.470
Thank you for
the reminder.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.770
Boy, I'll tell you,
whoever decided to take over

07:05.810 --> 07:07.280
after you planned this thing

07:07.310 --> 07:08.910
is crazy.

07:08.950 --> 07:10.156
You're taking over
the planning!

07:10.180 --> 07:11.110
Like I said...

07:16.450 --> 07:17.790
Oh, boy,
don't tell me

07:17.820 --> 07:19.750
you are taking
this thing to D.C.

07:19.790 --> 07:20.790
Of course I am.

07:20.820 --> 07:23.930
This is my grandpa's truck.
I love this truck.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.460
Obviously,
it doesn't love you.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.160
Why are we friends again?

07:27.200 --> 07:28.200
Because
I'm the only one

07:28.230 --> 07:29.130
that's going
to tell you

07:29.170 --> 07:31.530
that you will never get
this thing to start.

07:31.570 --> 07:33.170
Oh, yeah?

07:33.200 --> 07:34.900
Watch this!

07:37.870 --> 07:38.810
Ho, ho, ho!
It worked.

07:38.840 --> 07:40.610
Oh, great!

07:40.640 --> 07:42.780
Now you can take me
to town hall.

07:42.810 --> 07:44.310
No, I've got to go
to the airport.

07:46.920 --> 07:49.650
Well, it's on the way,
and this box is awkward,

07:49.690 --> 07:50.990
so let's go.

08:09.770 --> 08:10.816
Allie, you've got
to come in.

08:10.840 --> 08:12.810
I've got to go!

08:12.840 --> 08:13.886
But I want you
to see the layout.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.180
We're changing
some things.

08:15.210 --> 08:16.910
Come on.

08:16.950 --> 08:18.480
Okay, one minute.
You have one minute.

08:20.380 --> 08:23.920
This looks amazing!

08:23.950 --> 08:25.420
- You did such a good job.
- Thank you.

08:25.460 --> 08:28.820
This snowflake needs
a little bit more...

08:28.860 --> 08:30.060
Sparkle.

08:30.090 --> 08:31.390
Sparkle? okay.

08:33.460 --> 08:35.730
Uh-oh. here comes
the mayor.

08:35.770 --> 08:37.206
I haven't had enough
coffee for this.

08:37.230 --> 08:38.500
Not enough coffee
in Evergreen.

08:38.539 --> 08:39.500
Michelle!

08:39.539 --> 08:41.070
I have an idea.

08:41.100 --> 08:42.669
Good morning, Ezra.

08:42.710 --> 08:43.940
Former resident.

08:43.970 --> 08:45.070
I haven't even left yet!

08:45.110 --> 08:46.540
What's your idea
this time, Ezra?

08:46.580 --> 08:49.110
I think we should have an app.

08:49.150 --> 08:50.280
You know,

08:50.310 --> 08:52.450
an interactive experience.

08:52.480 --> 08:54.080
The festival
is in five days.

08:54.120 --> 08:56.280
We can't get an app
made in five days.

08:56.320 --> 08:59.120
Well, we need to find some way
to make the festival current.

08:59.160 --> 09:00.536
You know,
we need to shake things up.

09:00.560 --> 09:02.090
This is my first
time in charge,

09:02.130 --> 09:03.720
and I don't want
to shake things up.

09:03.760 --> 09:06.360
It's my first year as mayor,
and I want things shaken.

09:06.400 --> 09:07.930
Your dad was mayor
for 30 years,

09:07.960 --> 09:09.260
and this was good
enough for him.

09:09.300 --> 09:10.300
That's my point!

09:10.330 --> 09:12.076
We don't want this
to be our parents' festival.

09:12.100 --> 09:13.170
Allie?

09:13.200 --> 09:15.800
Oh, don't look at me.
Soon-to-be former resident.

09:15.840 --> 09:17.200
Hey, everyone.

09:17.240 --> 09:18.140
Came to help.

09:18.170 --> 09:20.110
Barbara, hi!
How's the inn coming along?

09:20.140 --> 09:21.980
Oh, my goodness,
so great!

09:22.010 --> 09:24.080
I'm opening in two weeks.
Can't believe it.

09:24.110 --> 09:25.550
It's so nice

09:25.580 --> 09:26.550
to have someone
come to Evergreen

09:26.580 --> 09:27.550
to open a business...

09:27.580 --> 09:28.480
Thanks.

09:28.520 --> 09:30.620
Instead of business
owners moving away.

09:30.650 --> 09:31.990
Okay, meanie.

09:32.020 --> 09:33.890
Don't make me tell them
about the incident

09:33.920 --> 09:35.460
in second grade.

09:36.860 --> 09:38.030
Best of luck in your new job.

09:39.100 --> 09:39.990
Michelle,

09:40.030 --> 09:42.230
since doc Hadley
retired and moved away,

09:42.270 --> 09:45.100
we need to find someone
new to play Santa.

09:45.130 --> 09:47.170
Now, I'm thinking that
we go against type...

09:47.200 --> 09:48.640
Younger,

09:48.670 --> 09:50.470
more... handsome.

09:50.510 --> 09:51.370
Too late.

09:51.410 --> 09:52.970
I already got a guy
out of Burlington.

09:53.010 --> 09:54.480
Oh,
I think I saw him.

09:54.510 --> 09:55.440
He looks
like Santa Claus

09:55.480 --> 09:56.510
even without the costume.

09:56.550 --> 09:57.380
Wait, he's here
already?

09:57.410 --> 09:58.850
Must be getting
ready for the role.

09:58.880 --> 10:00.410
Well, okay,

10:00.450 --> 10:01.696
if you guys want
to be "traditional,"

10:01.720 --> 10:03.850
but what about
the children's choir?

10:03.890 --> 10:06.590
Can't they do some
newer Christmas songs?

10:06.620 --> 10:07.960
Give me a break.

10:17.970 --> 10:19.970
We've got angels,
Blitzen,

10:20.000 --> 10:22.040
candy canes, decorations,

10:22.070 --> 10:23.140
elves...

10:24.410 --> 10:26.110
Fireplace!

10:26.140 --> 10:28.610
Fireplace
isn't a Christmas word.

10:28.650 --> 10:29.880
It's what Santa
comes down.

10:29.910 --> 10:31.810
Santa comes down the chimney.

10:31.850 --> 10:33.110
Okay, okay.

10:33.150 --> 10:35.220
Um, how about...

10:35.250 --> 10:38.150
Fruitcake?

10:38.190 --> 10:39.150
Pretty good.

10:39.190 --> 10:40.790
Pretty good?

10:40.820 --> 10:41.890
Okay, my turn.

10:41.920 --> 10:42.860
Your turn.

10:42.890 --> 10:43.860
g.

10:43.890 --> 10:44.890
Okay.

10:44.930 --> 10:46.290
Um... angels,

10:46.330 --> 10:49.830
Blitzen, candy canes,
decorations,

10:49.870 --> 10:52.970
elves, fruitcake,

10:53.000 --> 10:55.040
and...

10:55.070 --> 10:56.170
Gingerbread.

10:56.210 --> 10:57.970
Mm-mm-mm!

10:58.010 --> 10:59.010
That's a good one.

10:59.040 --> 11:01.080
Thanks...

11:01.110 --> 11:02.840
Except for now I'm hungry.

11:02.880 --> 11:04.510
Okay, you know what?

11:04.550 --> 11:05.756
Um, yeah,
I think we have time to stop.

11:05.780 --> 11:08.420
We've just got to make it quick.
We've got a flight to catch.

11:08.450 --> 11:09.820
Evergreen!
let's go there!

11:11.420 --> 11:12.820
Yeah, sure.
Sounds good.

11:25.870 --> 11:27.400
Merry Christmas! Hi.

11:29.240 --> 11:30.670
Hey, Henry.

11:30.710 --> 11:32.210
What's wrong?

11:32.240 --> 11:34.680
Oh, no, no, no,
she's not due for...

11:34.710 --> 11:37.210
Oh, no, Henry,
I'm on my way to the airport.

11:37.250 --> 11:40.350
Can't you call Dr. Myers?

11:40.380 --> 11:41.620
Oh.

11:41.650 --> 11:43.180
Right, okay.

11:43.220 --> 11:46.020
All right, well,
I'll be there as soon as I can.

11:46.060 --> 11:47.520
Okay, bye.

11:53.730 --> 11:57.160
We're here, dad.
It's so pretty.

12:03.310 --> 12:05.110
Seriously?

12:05.140 --> 12:06.110
I know you don't want me
to leave,

12:06.140 --> 12:08.040
but this is ridiculous.

12:16.350 --> 12:18.120
Oh, wow.

12:18.150 --> 12:19.550
This place is beautiful.

12:19.590 --> 12:20.896
How have I never
been here before?

12:20.920 --> 12:22.420
Wow.

12:22.460 --> 12:23.790
It's perfect here.

12:23.830 --> 12:26.230
This is what Christmas
is supposed to look like.

12:26.260 --> 12:27.806
Well, Florida's going
to look like this, too,

12:27.830 --> 12:29.130
only more palm trees,
you know?

12:34.500 --> 12:35.770
Oh.

12:35.810 --> 12:37.240
Hi there.

12:37.270 --> 12:39.110
Hi.
do you need some help?

12:39.140 --> 12:41.680
Oh, no.
It'll start...

12:41.710 --> 12:43.110
Eventually.

12:43.150 --> 12:44.280
Wishing you luck.

12:45.350 --> 12:46.450
Oh!

12:46.480 --> 12:47.820
Hey!

12:47.850 --> 12:49.580
Did you
just do that, dad?

12:49.620 --> 12:51.420
You know,
when I tell the story later,

12:51.450 --> 12:54.320
I fully intend to take credit,
so yes, let's say I did.

12:54.360 --> 12:56.260
Well,
how can I ever thank you?

12:56.290 --> 12:58.036
You could actually direct us
to a good place for lunch.

12:58.060 --> 12:58.930
Oh, well,

12:58.960 --> 13:01.130
the Chris kringle kitchen
is right here.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.360
It's the best
diner in town,

13:02.400 --> 13:03.500
and I'm not
just saying that

13:03.530 --> 13:04.700
because my folks run it.

13:04.730 --> 13:05.876
The Chris kringle kitchen...
Goodness.

13:05.900 --> 13:07.346
You guys really do take
Christmas seriously around here,

13:07.370 --> 13:08.340
don't you?

13:08.370 --> 13:09.770
Yeah, we sure do.

13:09.810 --> 13:11.170
Well, thanks a lot
for your help.

13:11.210 --> 13:12.286
Couldn't have done it
without you.

13:12.310 --> 13:13.510
Absolutely.

13:13.540 --> 13:14.510
Merry Christmas.

13:14.540 --> 13:15.640
Merry Christmas!

13:42.740 --> 13:44.640
Hey, Henry.

13:44.670 --> 13:45.940
Hey, doc!

13:53.920 --> 13:55.480
Sorry, Henry.

13:55.520 --> 13:57.480
She is not in labor.

13:57.520 --> 13:59.990
Are you sure?
I heard her mooing.

14:00.020 --> 14:01.360
Cows moo.

14:01.390 --> 14:02.360
It's a common occurrence.

14:02.390 --> 14:03.536
It was a different kind.

14:03.560 --> 14:04.830
It was a...

14:04.860 --> 14:06.360
"I'm about
to give birth" moo.

14:06.400 --> 14:08.200
You better brush up
on your bovine,

14:08.230 --> 14:09.200
'cause she's fine.

14:09.230 --> 14:11.070
What are we going to do

14:11.100 --> 14:12.400
if it happens
when you're gone?

14:12.440 --> 14:13.516
You're going
to call Dr. Myers

14:13.540 --> 14:14.170
in Montpelier.

14:14.200 --> 14:15.700
I have a plane
to catch.

14:15.740 --> 14:17.570
Oh, dear.

14:20.710 --> 14:21.886
You know, big city living's
going to change you.

14:21.910 --> 14:22.780
Oh, change
isn't a bad thing.

14:22.810 --> 14:24.250
Look at that!

14:24.280 --> 14:26.380
You built
a whole new barn.

14:26.420 --> 14:27.420
It's not a bad thing.

14:27.450 --> 14:28.450
Haven't moved in yet,

14:28.480 --> 14:29.496
and it's still just a barn.

14:29.520 --> 14:32.350
Well, I'll still be Allie,
just in a new city.

14:32.390 --> 14:33.536
So what are you going to do
with the old barn

14:33.560 --> 14:34.760
once you move in?

14:34.790 --> 14:35.790
I don't know.

14:35.830 --> 14:37.060
Tear it down,
probably.

14:37.090 --> 14:38.590
Ah.

14:38.630 --> 14:40.590
See that, Henry?
Even more change.

14:40.630 --> 14:42.760
It's in the air.
You can feel it.

14:42.800 --> 14:43.960
Merry Christmas.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.230
Merry Christmas, doc.

14:51.110 --> 14:52.410
Ha!

14:52.440 --> 14:54.310
There we go.
Bye.

14:54.340 --> 14:55.440
Bye.

15:02.020 --> 15:03.720
Glad you liked it.

15:03.750 --> 15:04.950
Thanks for coming.

15:08.120 --> 15:09.120
There you go.

15:09.160 --> 15:09.920
Thanks a lot.

15:09.960 --> 15:10.860
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

15:10.890 --> 15:13.160
Does the snow globe
really grant wishes?

15:13.200 --> 15:15.760
Well, like the sign says,

15:15.800 --> 15:18.130
"Only if you know
what your heart really wants."

15:19.870 --> 15:21.140
Where did it come from?

15:21.170 --> 15:23.740
See, nobody knows.

15:23.770 --> 15:25.510
One day, right after
we opened this diner,

15:25.540 --> 15:27.640
it just showed up
on our doorstep,

15:27.680 --> 15:31.780
and it's been here ever since,
with that sign.

15:31.810 --> 15:34.150
People come from all
over to make wishes.

15:34.180 --> 15:36.220
It's a tradition
here in Evergreen.

15:37.550 --> 15:38.620
Have you ever made one?

15:38.650 --> 15:40.120
Ah...

15:40.160 --> 15:41.260
I have.

15:41.290 --> 15:43.660
When I first got it,

15:43.690 --> 15:45.130
I wished
to have a little girl

15:45.160 --> 15:46.990
just like you,

15:47.030 --> 15:48.460
and you know what?

15:48.500 --> 15:49.560
My wish came true.

15:51.130 --> 15:52.270
So would you like
to try it?

15:52.300 --> 15:53.130
Sure.

15:53.170 --> 15:54.300
All right.

15:56.310 --> 15:57.310
Careful, Zoe.

16:09.590 --> 16:11.126
I wish we could have
Christmas here...

16:11.150 --> 16:12.920
In Evergreen.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.500
Your turn, dad.

16:24.530 --> 16:25.570
No thanks.

16:25.600 --> 16:28.140
Oh, come on, dad.
Don't be shy.

16:28.170 --> 16:29.570
I'm sure
whatever Zoe wished for

16:29.610 --> 16:32.140
is good enough
for both of us.

16:32.170 --> 16:33.570
Okay.

16:33.610 --> 16:34.810
Thank you!

16:34.840 --> 16:35.810
You come back

16:35.850 --> 16:37.226
and tell us
how that wish turned out, okay?

16:37.250 --> 16:38.580
Okay. bye!

16:38.610 --> 16:39.580
Bye, honey.

16:39.620 --> 16:41.020
Merry Christmas.

16:41.050 --> 16:44.420
Can't we stay
a little longer?

16:44.450 --> 16:46.520
Zoe, the sooner
we get to the airport,

16:46.560 --> 16:47.696
the sooner we get to Florida!

16:47.720 --> 16:50.690
Florida will be great, but...

16:50.730 --> 16:52.430
But what?

16:52.460 --> 16:53.860
Just look
at this place.

16:53.900 --> 16:54.930
I promise,

16:54.960 --> 16:57.260
Florida is going
to be so much fun,

16:57.300 --> 16:58.170
and you and me,
we are going to have

16:58.200 --> 17:00.530
the best Christmas ever.

17:02.540 --> 17:04.410
Okay?

17:04.440 --> 17:05.510
Okay, dad.

17:05.540 --> 17:06.869
Okay, all right.

17:09.050 --> 17:10.380
In you go, kiddo.

17:32.970 --> 17:35.170
So...

17:35.200 --> 17:36.200
You're on your way.

17:36.240 --> 17:37.840
All packed up
and ready to go.

17:37.870 --> 17:38.870
Mom...

17:38.910 --> 17:40.840
I'm not going to cry.

17:40.880 --> 17:41.886
You're going to be back
next week.

17:41.910 --> 17:43.080
Exactly.

17:43.110 --> 17:43.940
We'll have time

17:43.980 --> 17:45.350
for our big emotional
goodbye then.

17:45.380 --> 17:46.750
Right.

17:46.780 --> 17:48.750
Merry Christmas.

17:48.780 --> 17:51.390
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

17:51.420 --> 17:52.350
You travel safely.

17:52.390 --> 17:53.350
I will.

17:53.390 --> 17:54.590
Bye, daddy.

17:54.620 --> 17:55.560
Goodbye, sweetheart.

17:55.590 --> 17:56.560
Family hug.

17:56.590 --> 17:58.560
Okay, okay.

17:58.590 --> 18:00.360
I love you guys.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.740
Chopping onions?

18:08.770 --> 18:09.770
Yeah.

18:35.660 --> 18:36.660
It's this way.

18:40.200 --> 18:41.740
There you go.
Have a nice flight.

18:41.770 --> 18:42.770
Thanks so much.

18:43.710 --> 18:44.710
Hello.

18:46.540 --> 18:48.310
Here you go, sir.
Have a nice flight.

18:48.340 --> 18:49.740
Washington, D.C., please.

18:49.780 --> 18:51.080
Mm-hmm.

18:51.110 --> 18:53.350
Okay, please tell him
that Dr. Bellamy called

18:53.380 --> 18:55.520
and that I'll be back
after the New Year.

18:55.550 --> 18:57.480
Okay, thanks
so much.

18:57.520 --> 18:58.450
Last work call.

18:58.490 --> 19:00.190
I promise.

19:00.220 --> 19:02.190
It's okay, dad.
I'm having fun.

19:02.220 --> 19:03.120
Yeah?

19:03.160 --> 19:05.690
Okay, what's been
your favorite part so far?

19:05.730 --> 19:06.590
Evergreen, of course.

19:06.630 --> 19:08.260
Oh, hey!

19:08.300 --> 19:11.170
If it isn't my mechanic
and her assistant.

19:11.200 --> 19:12.500
Hi!
what are you doing here?

19:12.540 --> 19:13.630
Taking an airplane.

19:13.670 --> 19:16.140
We are, too.

19:16.170 --> 19:17.100
We're going to Florida.

19:17.140 --> 19:18.640
Washington, D.C.

19:18.670 --> 19:19.670
I'm Allie,
by the way.

19:19.710 --> 19:21.280
I'm Ryan, and this is Zoe.

19:21.310 --> 19:22.440
Hi, Zoe.

19:22.480 --> 19:24.140
How was lunch?

19:24.180 --> 19:25.780
It was great!

19:25.810 --> 19:27.780
And I made a wish
on the snow globe.

19:27.820 --> 19:29.396
I'm pretty sure
It's what my heart wanted.

19:29.420 --> 19:31.550
You know,
my grandpa used to say,

19:31.590 --> 19:34.320
"The heart knows what it wants
even when the head doesn't."

19:35.860 --> 19:36.860
So what did you wish for?

19:36.890 --> 19:39.160
I can't tell you,
or else it won't come true...

19:40.500 --> 19:41.800
But I'm starting to worry

19:41.830 --> 19:44.830
that it's not going
to come true anyways.

19:44.870 --> 19:46.670
Well, maybe
you should wish for it again,

19:46.700 --> 19:48.370
give it a little turbo boost.

19:48.400 --> 19:50.370
But I don't have
the snow globe.

19:50.410 --> 19:52.070
Oh, it's pretty powerful.

19:52.110 --> 19:53.256
I bet it'll be able
to hear you

19:53.280 --> 19:54.540
from all the way over here.

20:01.450 --> 20:03.580
Ladies and gentlemen, um,

20:03.620 --> 20:04.726
sorry to report
that due to heavy snow,

20:04.750 --> 20:07.450
we are closing the runways
and canceling all flights.

20:11.390 --> 20:12.790
Come on...

20:30.050 --> 20:31.310
Okay, great,
thanks.

20:33.020 --> 20:33.980
Hey there.

20:34.020 --> 20:35.150
Hi.

20:35.180 --> 20:36.496
Did you find a hotel
for the night?

20:36.520 --> 20:37.450
We did, yeah.

20:37.490 --> 20:38.320
We're just going to
grab something to eat.

20:38.350 --> 20:39.190
Did you?

20:39.220 --> 20:40.820
I'm going to head back
to Evergreen.

20:40.860 --> 20:41.820
It's not far.

20:41.860 --> 20:43.736
Are you sure you're okay
to drive in this storm?

20:43.760 --> 20:44.560
Oh, please.

20:44.590 --> 20:46.330
My truck's seen way worse
than this,

20:46.360 --> 20:47.760
and besides,
hopefully tomorrow,

20:47.800 --> 20:49.360
everything will be up
and running again.

20:50.370 --> 20:51.670
Does the flight
being canceled

20:51.700 --> 20:53.070
mean we aren't going to Florida?

20:53.100 --> 20:55.000
No, we will still
have plenty of time

20:55.040 --> 20:56.400
to catch our cruise.

20:56.440 --> 20:58.270
Ooh, a cruise?

20:58.310 --> 21:00.070
That sounds like
a fancy Christmas.

21:00.110 --> 21:01.110
Certainly a lot warmer.

21:01.140 --> 21:02.380
Yeah.

21:02.410 --> 21:03.510
It'll be great.

21:04.750 --> 21:06.010
Well...

21:06.050 --> 21:07.410
It was nice to meet you.

21:07.450 --> 21:08.780
Nice meeting you, too.

21:08.820 --> 21:10.780
Maybe we'll see you
round here tomorrow.

21:10.820 --> 21:11.950
Yeah...

21:11.990 --> 21:14.320
And if not, Merry Christmas.

21:15.590 --> 21:16.890
Merry Christmas, Allie!

21:22.100 --> 21:23.100
Two, please! Yeah.

21:30.570 --> 21:31.440
Allie?

21:31.470 --> 21:33.570
Hi! Bad news.

21:33.610 --> 21:36.040
The flight got canceled
because of the snow.

21:36.080 --> 21:38.280
I was just heading
out to the airport

21:38.310 --> 21:39.380
to pick you up.

21:39.420 --> 21:40.980
Oh, I'm sorry.

21:41.020 --> 21:42.720
It'll be sometime tomorrow,
hopefully.

21:42.750 --> 21:44.280
I'm working tomorrow.

21:44.320 --> 21:45.150
Oh, that's okay.

21:45.190 --> 21:46.670
I can just get a cab
from the airport.

21:47.660 --> 21:48.920
No second thoughts, right?

21:48.960 --> 21:52.060
Spencer!
I didn't cause the snow.

21:52.090 --> 21:54.960
<i>Let's just get me there.
Everything's going to be fine.</i>

21:55.000 --> 21:57.430
Sure, of course.

21:57.470 --> 21:58.470
Call me tomorrow?

21:58.500 --> 22:00.800
Of course.
Bye.

22:08.180 --> 22:11.240
Oh, no, come on.
Really?

22:11.280 --> 22:13.210
I thought you wanted me
to be in Evergreen!

22:26.030 --> 22:27.590
Can I sit anywhere?

22:27.630 --> 22:28.660
Okay. thanks.

22:29.970 --> 22:30.970
Allie!

22:31.000 --> 22:32.030
Oh, hi!

22:32.070 --> 22:33.616
Oh, hi, I thought you were going
back to Evergreen.

22:33.640 --> 22:34.800
Oh, I was.

22:34.840 --> 22:37.046
I've been trying to get my truck
started for the last hour.

22:37.070 --> 22:39.010
Do you want us to pretend
to fix it again?

22:39.040 --> 22:39.940
Thank you,

22:39.980 --> 22:42.180
but no,
I'm going to get a bite to eat,

22:42.210 --> 22:43.410
and then I'll try again.

22:43.450 --> 22:45.850
If it still doesn't start,
I'll get a hotel for the night.

22:45.880 --> 22:47.380
Come sit with
us, Allie!

22:47.420 --> 22:48.850
You can tell us
about Evergreen.

22:51.350 --> 22:53.520
What would you
like to know?

22:53.560 --> 22:55.520
Well,
what do you do for Christmas?

22:55.560 --> 22:57.120
Oh, well,
every year,

22:57.160 --> 22:58.460
we have this
big festival...

22:58.490 --> 22:59.690
Thank you...

22:59.730 --> 23:02.200
With food, games,
and a choir.

23:02.230 --> 23:04.300
People come from
all over the place.

23:04.330 --> 23:05.376
It's the town's
biggest tradition.

23:05.400 --> 23:06.416
What do you do
in Evergreen?

23:06.440 --> 23:08.570
I run a veterinarian practice,

23:08.600 --> 23:10.570
or I did,

23:10.610 --> 23:13.370
but now I'm moving
to Washington, D.C.

23:13.410 --> 23:14.840
To start a new job

23:14.880 --> 23:17.210
and... for
a change of scenery.

23:17.250 --> 23:20.010
So you're not going
to spend Christmas in Evergreen?

23:20.050 --> 23:21.820
No, for the
first time in...

23:21.850 --> 23:24.850
Forever.

23:24.890 --> 23:27.190
The festival
sounds like fun.

23:27.220 --> 23:28.920
It is...

23:28.960 --> 23:29.960
Ahem.

23:31.190 --> 23:34.430
But not as fun
as Florida.

23:34.460 --> 23:35.460
Come on,
the beach!

23:37.430 --> 23:39.070
Yeah.
it'll be great.

23:39.100 --> 23:40.070
Hey!

23:40.100 --> 23:41.700
Can I show you
something?

23:41.740 --> 23:42.540
- Sure.
- Check it out.

23:42.570 --> 23:46.170
Okay, you do a fold,
and another fold,

23:46.210 --> 23:50.880
and then these tiny
little tears, okay?

23:50.910 --> 23:52.610
Little triangles...

23:52.650 --> 23:53.650
And then...

23:55.250 --> 23:59.390
You unfold to reveal
the magical snowflake.

23:59.420 --> 24:01.090
Cool!

24:01.120 --> 24:03.120
Yeah, my mom
taught me that.

24:03.160 --> 24:05.190
She said this way,
I could always carry

24:05.230 --> 24:07.030
the magic of the Evergreen
Christmas with me

24:07.060 --> 24:08.030
wherever I go.

24:08.060 --> 24:09.700
Neat!

24:09.730 --> 24:10.960
My mom used to make

24:11.000 --> 24:12.500
a lot of our Christmas
decorations.

24:16.740 --> 24:19.040
Do you want to learn
how to do it yourself?

24:19.070 --> 24:19.770
Sure.

24:19.810 --> 24:21.410
'Kay, I'll show you.
Napkin!

24:21.440 --> 24:23.780
Napkin.

24:23.810 --> 24:24.950
All right.

24:24.980 --> 24:27.580
Your turn.
Fold in half.

24:27.620 --> 24:29.080
This way?

24:29.120 --> 24:30.326
You're
a natural. Good work.

24:30.350 --> 24:31.426
I learned
from the best.

24:31.450 --> 24:32.466
The key
is tearing

24:32.490 --> 24:33.420
these little
triangle pieces.

24:33.460 --> 24:34.460
Like this?

24:38.290 --> 24:39.430
I spoke to Allie.

24:39.460 --> 24:40.390
What'd she say?

24:40.430 --> 24:42.130
She got a hotel room,

24:42.160 --> 24:43.976
and she's going to try
to fly out tomorrow morning.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.470
See? You know
it's bad

24:45.500 --> 24:47.070
if they close
the airport.

24:47.100 --> 24:48.640
Luckily, we're not
landing planes,

24:48.670 --> 24:49.600
we're just having
a festival.

24:49.640 --> 24:52.810
Yeah, my first festival,
and we get a blizzard.

24:52.840 --> 24:55.510
Ezra, relax.

24:55.540 --> 24:57.980
Everything will
be just fine.

25:08.120 --> 25:09.636
Great. Well, thank you
so much for checking.

25:09.660 --> 25:10.890
No problem.

25:12.030 --> 25:15.860
Okay, uh, well,
thank you anyway.

25:15.900 --> 25:17.206
With all the flights
that were canceled,

25:17.230 --> 25:18.060
there's no more rooms.

25:18.100 --> 25:19.476
They won't let me stay
another night.

25:19.500 --> 25:20.830
Same with us,

25:20.870 --> 25:22.016
and there's no rooms anywhere,
it seems.

25:22.040 --> 25:24.116
Well, I'm going to go see
if I can get my truck started.

25:24.140 --> 25:25.040
If I can,

25:25.070 --> 25:26.386
you're welcome
to come back to Evergreen.

25:26.410 --> 25:28.110
Yes!

25:28.140 --> 25:29.540
I mean, yeah.

25:29.580 --> 25:31.210
We could go back
to Evergreen again.

25:31.250 --> 25:33.480
Right, dad?

25:33.520 --> 25:35.550
That's very
nice of you,

25:35.580 --> 25:36.520
but where would we even stay?

25:36.550 --> 25:37.650
Is there a hotel, or...?

25:38.820 --> 25:41.420
Sort of.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.870
Oh, hi, Allie, hi.

25:57.070 --> 25:59.210
Oh, that's terrible.

25:59.240 --> 26:00.840
I'm so sorry.

26:02.780 --> 26:04.040
Uh-huh.

26:05.880 --> 26:07.350
Uh...

26:07.380 --> 26:09.680
Well, yes, it'd be wonderful
to have them stay here,

26:09.720 --> 26:12.420
just as long as they know
it's not quite finished yet...

26:12.450 --> 26:15.260
But I can easily make up
a guest room.

26:15.290 --> 26:17.060
Wonderful.

26:17.090 --> 26:18.760
Okay, I'll see you then.

26:18.790 --> 26:20.930
Bye!

26:20.960 --> 26:23.200
Wow, how about that?

26:23.230 --> 26:25.200
My first guests!
Yes!

26:25.230 --> 26:27.130
Whoo!

26:29.940 --> 26:31.270
All right, guys,

26:31.310 --> 26:33.030
you can just throw
your luggage in the back.

26:36.410 --> 26:37.540
Hop on in, kiddo.

26:43.720 --> 26:44.850
Here we go.

26:44.890 --> 26:46.120
Hey!

26:47.960 --> 26:49.720
All right, guys,
buckle up.

26:49.760 --> 26:52.190
Evergreen,
here we come!

27:03.940 --> 27:05.370
- Allie?
- Yep?

27:05.410 --> 27:08.740
My dad's a people doctor,
and you're a pet doctor.

27:08.780 --> 27:10.580
So you're kind of the same.

27:10.610 --> 27:11.680
Except, well...

27:11.710 --> 27:12.756
Except my patients
can tell me

27:12.780 --> 27:13.850
where it hurts.

27:13.880 --> 27:14.750
Oh, you've obviously
never met

27:14.780 --> 27:16.380
an unhappy reindeer.

27:16.420 --> 27:17.280
You get
a lot of this.

27:19.290 --> 27:20.590
Oh!

27:20.620 --> 27:22.290
Ooh, it's Henry.
Will you hold it?

27:22.320 --> 27:23.260
Hey, Henry.

27:23.290 --> 27:24.720
<i> Doc,</i>
<i>Buttercup's in labor.</i>

27:24.760 --> 27:25.560
No, no, no,
I told you,

27:25.590 --> 27:27.060
she's not due
for another week...

27:27.100 --> 27:28.060
<i>But she's mooing like crazy.</i>

27:28.100 --> 27:29.130
Really?

27:29.160 --> 27:30.060
<i>Oh, yeah,
and loud.</i>

27:30.100 --> 27:31.000
All right, well,

27:31.030 --> 27:32.970
I'm actually headed back
into town right now.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.030
<i>You're coming back?</i>

27:34.070 --> 27:35.440
No, I know,
it's a long story.

27:35.470 --> 27:36.740
I'll be there
as soon as I can.

27:36.770 --> 27:37.700
<i>Thanks, doc.</i>

27:37.740 --> 27:39.570
Bye.

27:39.610 --> 27:41.210
Well, guys,
I'm afraid

27:41.240 --> 27:43.410
we're going to have
to take a little detour.

27:52.590 --> 27:53.620
Yeah.

27:53.660 --> 27:54.890
Henry, you
were right.

27:54.920 --> 27:56.160
She's in labor.

27:56.190 --> 27:57.620
Told you I knew their moos.

27:57.660 --> 27:58.930
What can I do
to help?

27:58.960 --> 28:00.330
Uh, all right.

28:00.360 --> 28:02.160
Henry, go get me a big
bucket of hot water,

28:02.200 --> 28:03.600
and Ryan, bring me my bag.

28:03.630 --> 28:04.600
Got it.

28:04.630 --> 28:05.930
'Kay.

28:07.300 --> 28:08.840
Uh, what can I do to help?

28:08.870 --> 28:11.140
You can, um,
take apart a bale of hay,

28:11.170 --> 28:12.110
'cause we're going
to make a little nest

28:12.140 --> 28:13.110
for the baby.

28:13.140 --> 28:15.440
You got it.

28:19.780 --> 28:21.826
This is a disaster.
What are we supposed to do?

28:21.850 --> 28:23.080
We can fix it.

28:23.120 --> 28:25.150
We don't have the
money to fix it.

28:25.190 --> 28:26.520
Hey, guys,
what's going on?

28:26.560 --> 28:27.520
I just got your message.

28:27.560 --> 28:30.160
Getting a little lesson
in municipal finance

28:30.190 --> 28:31.760
from Mr. Stingy
over here.

28:31.790 --> 28:34.090
A water pipe burst
in the town hall.

28:34.130 --> 28:36.130
Water everywhere,
which then froze.

28:36.160 --> 28:37.676
It's like an ice skating rink
in there.

28:37.700 --> 28:38.800
We can fix
it in time.

28:38.830 --> 28:39.930
Sure, we could,

28:39.970 --> 28:42.016
if there was enough in
the town hall preservation fund,

28:42.040 --> 28:44.040
but the festival
was raising money

28:44.070 --> 28:45.940
for the town hall
preservation fund.

28:45.970 --> 28:47.810
Which is kind of ironic,
if you think about it.

28:48.910 --> 28:50.140
Sorry.

28:52.550 --> 28:54.280
She's so beautiful.

28:54.320 --> 28:56.180
She is.
She's awesome.

28:56.220 --> 28:57.220
Thanks for your help.

28:57.250 --> 28:58.650
Me?

28:58.690 --> 28:59.950
Yeah, you!

28:59.990 --> 29:01.466
I couldn't have done this
without you.

29:01.490 --> 29:03.360
Allie
has a point.

29:03.390 --> 29:05.990
Zoe, I think you should
be the one to name her.

29:06.900 --> 29:08.630
Okay,

29:08.660 --> 29:10.530
but this is big.

29:10.570 --> 29:12.500
I'm going
to need a minute.

29:12.530 --> 29:15.140
What should
i call you?

29:17.210 --> 29:19.410
Hey, um...
Thank you.

29:19.440 --> 29:21.070
For what?

29:21.110 --> 29:23.680
For making Zoe
feel so special.

29:23.710 --> 29:25.010
Oh...

29:25.050 --> 29:27.210
Lot of special
in that moment.

29:27.250 --> 29:28.650
Nice to spread
it around.

29:31.090 --> 29:34.520
I'm really going
to miss this.

29:34.560 --> 29:36.490
After seeing how good
you are with animals,

29:36.530 --> 29:37.360
I have a feeling

29:37.390 --> 29:40.030
that they're going
to miss you, too.

29:42.530 --> 29:43.400
Hey, everybody!

29:43.430 --> 29:46.000
I've decided

29:46.030 --> 29:48.230
that the baby's
name should be...

29:50.710 --> 29:52.840
Snowflake.

29:52.870 --> 29:54.610
Perfect.

29:54.640 --> 29:55.880
I love it.

29:59.550 --> 30:00.550
Dinner time!

30:00.580 --> 30:01.880
Come on,
up you get!

30:03.650 --> 30:04.680
Push.
there you go.

30:04.720 --> 30:06.190
Over there.
Go see mommy.

30:06.220 --> 30:07.220
There you go.

30:12.830 --> 30:13.936
So what are we
supposed to do?

30:13.960 --> 30:15.260
Cancel the
Christmas festival?

30:15.300 --> 30:17.560
No, no!
You can't cancel the festival!

30:17.600 --> 30:19.370
The entire town
looks forward to it all year.

30:19.400 --> 30:20.646
Well, the only way we're going
to have it this year

30:20.670 --> 30:22.900
is we find someplace else
to do it.

30:22.940 --> 30:24.786
There's no place else
in town with enough space!

30:24.810 --> 30:25.940
That's it.

30:25.970 --> 30:27.040
I'm calling Allie.

30:27.080 --> 30:28.610
No! No, you can't!

30:28.640 --> 30:30.440
This is not her
problem anymore!

30:30.480 --> 30:32.250
You can't call her!

30:34.020 --> 30:35.980
Zoe, we need to go.

30:36.020 --> 30:37.480
But I love Snowflake!

30:37.520 --> 30:38.480
I swear, she's going

30:38.520 --> 30:39.796
to try and smuggle that thing
in her suitcase.

30:39.820 --> 30:40.750
Your herd gets any bigger,

30:40.790 --> 30:42.790
you're going to have
to keep this old barn.

30:42.820 --> 30:43.900
Or finally put
that new barn

30:43.930 --> 30:44.890
to good use.

30:45.860 --> 30:46.960
Oh, hold on one second.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.760
Allie Shaw.

30:48.800 --> 30:51.330
Whoa, Ezra, calm down.
I can't understand you.

30:51.370 --> 30:52.230
Oh, no.

30:52.270 --> 30:54.700
Guys, we may have
to cancel the festival.

30:56.040 --> 30:57.170
Somewhere else
to do it?

30:57.210 --> 30:58.810
Where?

30:58.840 --> 31:00.310
Zoe, come on!

31:02.180 --> 31:03.940
Hey, Henry...

31:03.980 --> 31:05.040
I think I've got an idea

31:05.080 --> 31:07.950
how we could put your new barn
to really good use.

31:07.980 --> 31:08.950
How would you like

31:08.980 --> 31:10.950
to host the
Christmas festival?

31:10.990 --> 31:14.120
Sure thing!

31:18.030 --> 31:19.090
Wow, dad, look!

31:19.130 --> 31:21.960
It's beautiful!

31:22.000 --> 31:23.530
Come on,
let's go inside.

31:23.570 --> 31:25.130
Yeah,
let's go inside.

31:27.070 --> 31:28.030
Next up...

31:28.070 --> 31:30.870
This is the dining room.

31:30.910 --> 31:33.870
It's like
we're in a storybook!

31:33.910 --> 31:35.380
When did you have
time to decorate?

31:35.410 --> 31:37.110
Oh, I've been working
non-stop.

31:37.150 --> 31:37.980
The only thing
i haven't been able to do

31:38.010 --> 31:39.180
is get a tree.

31:39.210 --> 31:40.510
Oh, I haven't
gotten one either.

31:40.550 --> 31:42.450
Well, the inn looks beautiful,
Barbara.

31:42.480 --> 31:44.480
Thank you so much
for letting us stay the night.

31:44.520 --> 31:45.690
Oh, are you kidding?

31:45.720 --> 31:47.520
I am so happy
to have you here.

31:47.560 --> 31:48.696
Do you want to see
the rest of the place?

31:48.720 --> 31:49.660
- Yes.
- Yeah!

31:49.690 --> 31:51.460
Okay.

31:51.490 --> 31:53.230
You know what?
Why don't you go ahead?

31:53.260 --> 31:54.376
We'll catch up with you
in just a moment.

31:54.400 --> 31:55.190
Okay! bye.

31:55.230 --> 31:56.330
Thanks. bye.

31:58.530 --> 32:00.130
Listen, um...

32:00.170 --> 32:02.500
I just wanted to say thank you
one more time

32:02.540 --> 32:04.500
for just taking
such good care of us today.

32:04.540 --> 32:06.140
It's my pleasure,

32:06.170 --> 32:08.340
and hopefully, the airport
will be open tomorrow

32:08.380 --> 32:09.710
so you guys can be on your way.

32:09.740 --> 32:10.840
Yeah, yeah,

32:10.880 --> 32:12.180
although as detours go,

32:12.210 --> 32:14.550
this has been
a pretty eventful one.

32:14.580 --> 32:16.020
I doubt we'll see
too many cows

32:16.050 --> 32:17.220
on the cruise.

32:17.250 --> 32:19.420
Oh, a cow cruise!
That sounds fun.

32:19.450 --> 32:21.320
So, wait,

32:21.360 --> 32:23.390
if you don't
mind me asking,

32:23.430 --> 32:25.660
why Florida?

32:25.690 --> 32:28.530
Sarah, my wife, she...

32:28.560 --> 32:30.530
she died last year,
just before Christmas,

32:30.570 --> 32:32.730
which was really hard,
you know?

32:32.770 --> 32:34.700
So every candy cane,
every Christmas tree,

32:34.740 --> 32:36.570
was like a reminder.

32:36.600 --> 32:37.670
So anyway, this year,

32:37.710 --> 32:41.210
I wanted Zoe to have sunny,
palm trees, Florida...

32:41.240 --> 32:44.040
Stay as far away from Christmas
as possible.

32:44.080 --> 32:44.980
And then I brought you

32:45.010 --> 32:47.710
to the Vermont version
of the North Pole.

32:47.750 --> 32:49.950
Well,
it's like North Pole adjacent.

32:49.990 --> 32:50.996
It's like a suburb
of the North Pole.

32:51.020 --> 32:53.390
Yeah, like, right there
on the commuter line.

32:53.420 --> 32:55.050
Right there.

32:55.090 --> 32:57.720
Well, listen,
if it's any consolation,

32:57.760 --> 32:58.730
I think she's okay.

32:58.760 --> 33:00.730
More than okay.

33:00.760 --> 33:02.360
She's an awesome kid.

33:02.400 --> 33:04.130
Thanks.

33:04.170 --> 33:05.406
Wish I could take credit
for it,

33:05.430 --> 33:06.730
but that was all Sarah.

33:06.770 --> 33:08.770
Even after I pulled back
from patient care,

33:08.800 --> 33:11.870
I work so much that, um...

33:11.910 --> 33:13.370
I think you're too
hard on yourself.

33:13.410 --> 33:15.480
You don't have to be super dad
to be a good dad.

33:15.510 --> 33:17.110
Well, um...

33:17.150 --> 33:19.450
Anyway, thank you.

33:22.280 --> 33:24.280
Yeah.

33:24.320 --> 33:25.920
Ahem!

33:25.950 --> 33:27.120
Careful, you two.

33:27.160 --> 33:29.720
You're standing
under mistletoe.

33:29.760 --> 33:30.760
Oh!

33:30.790 --> 33:31.890
That's...

33:31.930 --> 33:33.130
I, um...

33:35.860 --> 33:37.600
I should go.

33:37.630 --> 33:38.630
Have a good night.

33:53.480 --> 33:55.110
You didn't have
to bring me food.

33:55.150 --> 33:58.320
I'm your mother.
Of course, I did...

33:58.350 --> 33:59.420
And...

33:59.450 --> 34:02.120
Why did you put up all your
Christmas decorations

34:02.160 --> 34:03.720
if you're not even
going to be here?

34:03.760 --> 34:04.990
I know,
i couldn't help myself,

34:05.030 --> 34:06.830
but at least
i didn't put up a tree.

34:06.860 --> 34:08.290
I'm not
completely Christmas crazy.

34:08.330 --> 34:09.730
Just a little Christmas crazy.

34:09.760 --> 34:11.030
Exactly.

34:12.429 --> 34:14.469
So, did you get
Ryan and Zoe all settled?

34:14.500 --> 34:15.940
Yes, they're at the inn.

34:17.540 --> 34:18.469
He seems like a good guy.

34:18.510 --> 34:19.570
He does, yeah.

34:19.610 --> 34:22.580
Yeah, he's a doctor
and a single dad.

34:22.610 --> 34:23.780
I don't know
how he does it.

34:25.110 --> 34:26.186
So, have you
talked to Spencer?

34:26.210 --> 34:27.250
I have.

34:27.280 --> 34:29.350
Yeah, a little while ago.

34:29.380 --> 34:30.380
Everything's fine.

34:30.420 --> 34:32.020
Honey, as long as you feel

34:32.050 --> 34:34.690
like you're doing the best thing
for you,

34:34.719 --> 34:36.159
then I'm on board.

34:36.190 --> 34:38.190
I do, thank you.

34:38.230 --> 34:40.560
Just not going to be the same
without you around here.

34:40.600 --> 34:42.260
I think that's partly why

34:42.300 --> 34:44.699
your dad and i
are talking about retiring.

34:45.969 --> 34:47.030
You are?

34:47.070 --> 34:48.775
Actually, your father is doing
most of the talking,

34:48.800 --> 34:51.199
and I am listening
very politely.

34:51.239 --> 34:52.710
You don't want to do it?

34:52.739 --> 34:54.340
I can't imagine
leaving Evergreen...

34:56.040 --> 34:57.740
But if my brave daughter

34:57.780 --> 35:00.180
can start a new chapter
in her life,

35:00.220 --> 35:01.526
then I guess
her parents can, too.

35:02.550 --> 35:04.050
But don't tell anyone,

35:04.090 --> 35:06.220
especially not Ezra.

35:06.250 --> 35:07.750
I don't think
his heart could take it.

35:07.790 --> 35:09.520
I don't think so either.

35:09.560 --> 35:10.590
Mm...

35:10.630 --> 35:11.906
And I've got to go,
'cause I'm going to be late.

35:11.930 --> 35:12.760
Where you off to?

35:12.790 --> 35:15.600
To spread a little
Christmas cheer...

35:15.630 --> 35:16.960
And you know,

35:17.000 --> 35:18.076
I think maybe
we'll stop by the inn

35:18.100 --> 35:19.200
for Zoe and Ryan.

35:19.230 --> 35:21.370
Well, I want
a little cheer.

35:21.400 --> 35:22.740
Can I tag along?

35:22.770 --> 35:24.100
Yes, you can tag along.

35:24.140 --> 35:25.040
Go get your coat.

35:25.070 --> 35:26.270
Okay.

35:32.480 --> 35:33.496
Do you have any sevens?

35:33.520 --> 35:35.280
Go fish.

35:35.320 --> 35:36.950
Ugh, again?

35:36.990 --> 35:38.450
I'm just that good.

Hi, Allie.

36:17.360 --> 36:18.860
Ryan!

36:18.890 --> 36:19.990
Hi.

36:20.030 --> 36:20.930
Where's Zoe?

36:20.960 --> 36:22.700
Oh, she's back at
the inn with Barbara.

36:22.730 --> 36:24.430
I heard the airport's
open again.

36:24.470 --> 36:25.360
Thought I'd come and see

36:25.400 --> 36:26.706
if we could hitch
a ride back with you.

36:26.730 --> 36:28.830
Oh, of course, yeah...

36:28.870 --> 36:31.270
I want you to meet, um,
my friend, Michelle Lansing.

36:31.310 --> 36:32.340
Hi.

36:32.370 --> 36:33.770
Hi, Michelle.

36:33.810 --> 36:35.340
And I think you've met
my mom and dad.

36:35.380 --> 36:36.710
Hi, nice
to see you again.

36:36.740 --> 36:38.680
This is Dr. Ryan Bellamy.

36:38.710 --> 36:39.710
Doctor?

36:41.150 --> 36:43.820
And this is mayor Ezra Green.

36:43.850 --> 36:46.650
- You're a doctor?
- I am, yes.

36:46.690 --> 36:49.290
You know, our town doctor
just retired, and...

36:49.320 --> 36:50.860
Leave him alone, Ezra.

36:50.890 --> 36:52.860
Right. sorry.

36:52.890 --> 36:54.660
More important
matters at hand.

36:55.700 --> 36:56.830
Listen up, everybody.

36:56.860 --> 36:58.800
I have some bad news.

36:58.830 --> 37:00.300
They had to shut
down the highway.

37:00.340 --> 37:01.570
Wait, what?

37:01.600 --> 37:03.540
The storm last night
caused a rock slide.

37:03.570 --> 37:04.740
Oh, I don't believe this.

37:04.770 --> 37:06.510
Why is that a problem?

37:06.540 --> 37:08.810
There's only one road
in and out of town.

37:08.840 --> 37:11.210
And now it's blocked
by a bunch of big rocks.

37:11.250 --> 37:12.710
Uh, well,
when will it open?

37:12.750 --> 37:14.680
Tomorrow... maybe.

37:14.720 --> 37:16.156
Tomorrow?
we're going to miss our flight!

37:16.180 --> 37:17.220
Yeah.

37:17.250 --> 37:18.220
Okay, well,

37:18.250 --> 37:19.496
there's got to be
some other way out of town.

37:19.520 --> 37:20.990
Snowmobiles?

37:21.020 --> 37:22.150
Snowplow?

37:22.190 --> 37:23.120
A helicopter?

37:23.160 --> 37:24.890
Forget
about people getting out.

37:24.930 --> 37:26.066
How's anybody
going to get in?

37:26.090 --> 37:27.030
Nobody's going
to be able to come

37:27.060 --> 37:28.360
to the Christmas festival.

37:28.400 --> 37:29.560
This is terrible.

37:29.600 --> 37:31.060
Everyone in Evergreen
can come.

37:31.100 --> 37:32.670
I've got people coming

37:32.700 --> 37:35.600
from Montpelier
and Burlington.

37:35.640 --> 37:36.570
Allie, what
are we going to do?

37:36.600 --> 37:37.370
All right, all right.

37:37.410 --> 37:38.546
Why don't we meet
at Henry's barn

37:38.570 --> 37:39.410
this afternoon

37:39.440 --> 37:40.556
and start setting up
for the festival,

37:40.580 --> 37:42.280
and if the road clears,

37:42.310 --> 37:43.880
great,
and if it doesn't,

37:43.910 --> 37:44.780
then this year,

37:44.810 --> 37:47.350
the festival will just be
for Evergreen...

37:47.380 --> 37:49.850
And guests.

37:49.880 --> 37:51.880
Oh, okay, well,
i guess I feel better.

37:51.920 --> 37:53.466
You know, I think this is
another situation

37:53.490 --> 37:56.090
that could've been solved
if we had an app.

37:56.120 --> 37:57.560
Oh, Ezra, please...

37:57.590 --> 37:58.360
No, this is
a good thing.

37:58.390 --> 37:59.630
I mean,

37:59.660 --> 38:01.590
this will light up
the whole...

38:01.630 --> 38:04.100
Hey, I'm so sorry.

38:04.130 --> 38:06.600
If I hadn't invited you here,
you wouldn't be stuck.

38:06.630 --> 38:08.130
You didn't cause
the rock slide.

38:08.170 --> 38:09.200
Did you?

38:09.240 --> 38:10.770
No, I didn't.

38:10.810 --> 38:12.510
My neighbor
has my jackhammer.

38:15.240 --> 38:17.380
I just wanted this Christmas
to be better.

38:18.610 --> 38:20.810
Well...

38:20.850 --> 38:23.550
Y'all are stuck here
another day.

38:23.580 --> 38:26.720
Maybe I could help make
Christmas a little better...

38:26.750 --> 38:28.450
For Zoe.

38:28.490 --> 38:31.790
We do have plenty of snow.

38:33.460 --> 38:34.330
What do you think?

38:34.360 --> 38:36.130
I think he's perfect!

38:36.160 --> 38:38.230
Good work, you guys!

38:38.270 --> 38:40.000
It's so awesome.

38:40.030 --> 38:41.530
I've got to get a picture.

38:42.800 --> 38:43.740
All right, ready?

38:43.770 --> 38:44.900
One, two, three!

38:45.970 --> 38:48.240
♪ Christmas is here again ♪

38:49.280 --> 38:50.486
Oh, you know what?
I'm getting a phone call.

38:50.510 --> 38:51.410
I'll be right back.

38:51.450 --> 38:52.950
Okay.

38:52.980 --> 38:54.150
Hi!

38:54.180 --> 38:55.450
Hey.

38:55.480 --> 38:56.350
Are you at the airport?

38:56.380 --> 38:57.320
<i>No.</i>

38:57.350 --> 39:00.090
The storm last night
shut down the highway.

39:00.120 --> 39:01.760
I'm going to be here
another day at least.

39:03.190 --> 39:05.160
Why didn't you just stay
in Burlington?

39:05.190 --> 39:06.860
All the hotels were booked.

39:06.890 --> 39:08.276
I would've had
to sleep in my truck.

39:08.300 --> 39:10.860
Okay.

39:10.900 --> 39:12.100
So, what's the plan?

39:12.130 --> 39:13.530
Well...

39:13.570 --> 39:14.500
I'm thinking at this point,

39:14.540 --> 39:16.940
it might make most sense
for me to stay here.

39:18.070 --> 39:19.040
Allie, what about Christmas?

39:19.070 --> 39:22.340
Spencer, my folks
are talking about retiring.

39:22.380 --> 39:24.610
This could be
my last Christmas in Evergreen.

39:24.650 --> 39:25.956
I mean, I was just really
looking forward

39:25.980 --> 39:27.550
to spending it with you, is all.

39:27.580 --> 39:28.480
<i>I know.</i>

39:28.520 --> 39:29.680
Me too,

39:29.720 --> 39:30.980
but I can come
after Christmas,

39:31.020 --> 39:32.620
and we can have
plenty of time then.

39:32.650 --> 39:34.350
<i>Okay?</i>

39:34.390 --> 39:35.390
Yeah, okay.

39:35.420 --> 39:36.360
<i>I'll call you tomorrow.</i>

39:36.390 --> 39:38.320
- Bye.
- <i> Bye.</i>

39:44.870 --> 39:45.870
Allie!

39:45.900 --> 39:48.030
Hey, look at you guys!

39:48.070 --> 39:49.870
We're making
snow angels.

39:49.900 --> 39:51.200
They're gorgeous!

39:51.240 --> 39:52.710
Mine looks more like
a snow gorilla.

39:52.740 --> 39:54.640
A Christmas gorilla.

39:55.740 --> 39:57.580
It's so much fun here.

39:57.610 --> 39:59.810
We should so something nice
for Barbara,

39:59.850 --> 40:01.710
'cause she's been so nice to us.

40:01.750 --> 40:02.750
Uh...

40:02.780 --> 40:03.780
That's really sweet.

40:05.520 --> 40:06.550
I got an idea.

40:20.900 --> 40:22.440
Ho, ho, ho!

40:22.470 --> 40:23.400
You here?

40:23.440 --> 40:24.400
In here.

40:24.440 --> 40:25.910
What's this?

40:25.940 --> 40:26.940
Well, we figured,

40:26.970 --> 40:28.686
since we have to impose
on you for one more night,

40:28.710 --> 40:29.740
the least we could do

40:29.780 --> 40:31.740
is get you
a Christmas tree.

40:31.780 --> 40:33.750
Oh, you didn't have
to do that...

40:33.780 --> 40:35.180
But I'm glad you did!

40:35.220 --> 40:37.180
Can we decorate it?

40:37.220 --> 40:38.180
Oh, of course!

40:38.220 --> 40:40.190
Let's go get
some ornaments.

40:41.460 --> 40:42.420
Shall we trim it up?

40:42.460 --> 40:43.760
Let's do it.

40:43.790 --> 40:45.190
Okay.

40:47.300 --> 40:49.030
Mm, sappy.

40:50.330 --> 40:51.876
How's that
"steering clear of Christmas"

40:51.900 --> 40:53.230
going for you?

40:53.270 --> 40:54.130
Really well, clearly.

40:55.140 --> 40:55.970
I'll tell you,

40:56.000 --> 40:57.700
there is just something
about this place

40:57.740 --> 41:00.540
that makes it just tough

41:00.580 --> 41:02.480
to resist
the Christmas spirit.

41:02.510 --> 41:03.780
Evergreen'll do that to you.

41:03.810 --> 41:05.726
I decorated my place this year.
I'm not even going to be here.

41:05.750 --> 41:06.750
Oh...

41:07.680 --> 41:08.926
Actually,
it's a good thing I did.

41:08.950 --> 41:10.020
What do you mean?

41:11.920 --> 41:12.790
It turns out

41:12.820 --> 41:14.290
I don't think I'm
going to go to D.C.

41:14.320 --> 41:15.250
For Christmas
this year.

41:15.290 --> 41:16.920
No? Why not?

41:16.960 --> 41:18.920
It's complicated.

41:18.960 --> 41:20.390
Mm.

41:20.430 --> 41:21.330
A boy.

41:21.360 --> 41:22.730
Oh.

41:24.270 --> 41:25.500
Spencer.

41:25.530 --> 41:26.970
Two years of
long distance

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
in a relationship

41:28.040 --> 41:32.140
that just couldn't handle
the distance part...

41:32.170 --> 41:33.916
But we were going to spend
this Christmas together

41:33.940 --> 41:35.170
and just sort of see

41:35.210 --> 41:38.310
if there was something...
There.

41:38.350 --> 41:39.310
No, I get it.
I get it.

41:39.350 --> 41:41.580
Sarah and I were long distance
when we started.

41:41.620 --> 41:43.320
I was in Boston,

41:43.350 --> 41:45.650
she was in this little town
in Ohio.

41:45.690 --> 41:47.620
And that worked out well,
though, right?

41:47.660 --> 41:49.690
Yeah, I guess we just knew
we'd wind up together,

41:49.720 --> 41:52.790
so it helped us
get through it.

41:56.130 --> 41:59.030
I actually considered
going there

41:59.070 --> 42:01.600
and becoming
a small-town doctor.

42:02.740 --> 42:03.970
Yeah.

42:04.010 --> 42:06.210
Now I kind of wish I had.

42:06.240 --> 42:07.610
My work doesn't allow

42:07.640 --> 42:09.780
the kind of time
I'd like to spend with Zoe,

42:09.810 --> 42:11.540
which is hard.

42:11.580 --> 42:13.510
Well...

42:13.550 --> 42:15.610
Don't tell mayor Ezra that.

42:15.650 --> 42:17.780
He'll open up an office for you
in town hall.

42:17.820 --> 42:19.450
Doc Bellamy.

42:19.490 --> 42:20.450
It's got a nice ring.

42:20.490 --> 42:23.220
Yeah, Dr. B!
The doctor is in.

42:23.260 --> 42:24.420
Right?

42:26.560 --> 42:29.960
I've got to say...

42:30.000 --> 42:33.230
This is the last place
i thought I would find myself

42:33.270 --> 42:34.900
three days before Christmas.

42:34.940 --> 42:37.170
Same here.

42:37.200 --> 42:38.540
But, um...

42:38.570 --> 42:41.370
Guess it's not so bad.

42:44.280 --> 42:46.210
No.

42:46.250 --> 42:48.110
It's not bad at all.

42:50.020 --> 42:52.220
You guys ready?
We got the ornaments.

42:52.250 --> 42:53.920
Come on,
let's decorate the tree!

42:53.960 --> 42:55.320
Yeah, let's!

43:04.100 --> 43:06.700
This is, like,
the best tree ever!

43:06.730 --> 43:08.570
I agree.

43:08.600 --> 43:11.870
I bet the one at the festival
won't be anywhere near as nice.

43:11.910 --> 43:12.740
We'll see
when we go to the barn

43:12.770 --> 43:14.570
later tonight.

43:16.110 --> 43:17.280
Is there
a Christmas festival

43:17.310 --> 43:18.580
where you're
moving to, Allie?

43:18.610 --> 43:19.580
Oh, I think there is,

43:19.610 --> 43:21.196
but it's nothing like
the one in Evergreen.

43:21.220 --> 43:22.850
Then why do you want
to move there?

43:22.880 --> 43:25.250
Well,
I've lived here my whole life,

43:25.290 --> 43:27.020
and it's a wonderful place.

43:27.050 --> 43:27.990
It really is,

43:28.020 --> 43:30.420
but there's a whole big wide
world out there.

43:30.460 --> 43:32.220
I want to see it.

43:32.260 --> 43:34.130
I'm ready for a change.

43:34.160 --> 43:36.230
You know,
my grandpa used to say,

43:36.260 --> 43:38.300
"The further you get
from where you started,

43:38.330 --> 43:40.470
the closer you get
to where you belong."

43:40.500 --> 43:42.770
But what if you belong here?

43:42.800 --> 43:44.200
Okay...

43:44.240 --> 43:46.970
I think we are ready
for the angel.

43:47.010 --> 43:48.770
Who wants to do the honors?

43:48.810 --> 43:50.210
Me, please!

43:50.240 --> 43:52.280
Okay,
go for it, Zoe.

43:53.610 --> 43:54.580
All right.

43:54.620 --> 43:56.250
Yup.

43:56.280 --> 43:57.780
Here we go!

44:00.760 --> 44:03.120
Yeah!

44:03.160 --> 44:04.390
Okay. everybody ready?

44:04.430 --> 44:05.430
Ready!

44:06.660 --> 44:09.160
And drumroll!
Drumroll, yep!

44:33.220 --> 44:35.150
Whoa!

44:35.190 --> 44:37.790
Look at this!

44:37.830 --> 44:38.590
♪ We wish you
a Merry Christmas ♪

44:38.630 --> 44:39.960
Wow.

44:39.990 --> 44:40.830
♪ We wish you
a Merry Christmas ♪

44:40.860 --> 44:45.460
♪ and a happy new year ♪

44:48.740 --> 44:49.700
Hey, dad?

44:49.740 --> 44:51.600
Can I be
in the choir?

44:51.640 --> 44:52.470
That's for the
festival, kiddo.

44:52.510 --> 44:54.510
We're not going to be here,
remember?

44:55.740 --> 44:57.010
Zoe!

44:57.040 --> 44:58.140
Merry Christmas!

44:59.380 --> 45:00.780
Are you sure

45:00.820 --> 45:01.996
you want to put
the craft booths

45:02.020 --> 45:02.950
in the back?

45:02.980 --> 45:03.980
Ezra!

45:04.020 --> 45:05.520
You are driving
me crazy.

45:05.550 --> 45:06.890
I am in charge
of the festival.

45:06.920 --> 45:07.890
Me, not you.

45:07.920 --> 45:08.950
The festival

45:08.990 --> 45:09.890
is an important part
of the town,

45:09.920 --> 45:11.660
and I am mayor
of the town.

45:11.690 --> 45:12.830
Me, not you.

45:12.860 --> 45:14.230
Your daddy retired,

45:14.260 --> 45:15.376
and nobody else
wanted the job.

45:15.400 --> 45:17.630
A win is still a win.

45:17.670 --> 45:19.970
Ezra, I've got this
under control.

45:21.670 --> 45:23.300
Okay? there are no problems.
Hello?

45:23.340 --> 45:24.800
Okay.

45:24.840 --> 45:26.510
Right. got it.

45:27.680 --> 45:28.686
Okay, now we've got a problem.

45:28.710 --> 45:29.480
I knew it.

45:29.510 --> 45:31.080
Wait, what?
What's the problem?

45:31.110 --> 45:32.040
We're not going
to have any food

45:32.080 --> 45:32.910
for the festival.

45:32.950 --> 45:33.880
What?

45:33.910 --> 45:36.250
Mrs. Wallace
and the ladies from the church

45:36.280 --> 45:37.250
are usually in charge

45:37.280 --> 45:38.050
of the feast
and the cookies,

45:38.090 --> 45:40.220
but they went to
Montpelier yesterday

45:40.250 --> 45:41.590
for a book club,
and now...

45:41.620 --> 45:42.690
And now
they can't get back

45:42.720 --> 45:43.920
'cause the road
is closed.

45:43.960 --> 45:46.160
Right, and even if
it got fixed tomorrow,

45:46.190 --> 45:47.536
there still wouldn't
be enough time

45:47.560 --> 45:48.530
for them to prepare
everything that we need.

45:48.560 --> 45:50.060
All right, all right,

45:50.100 --> 45:51.700
there's got to be
something we can do.

45:52.900 --> 45:53.900
Hold on a second.

45:53.930 --> 45:56.140
I've got an idea.

46:00.070 --> 46:00.870
Excuse me, everyone.

46:00.910 --> 46:02.940
May I have
your attention, please?

46:02.980 --> 46:06.250
Raise your hand
if you like to bake.

46:09.280 --> 46:11.020
A couple more?

46:11.050 --> 46:12.750
Anyone else?

46:14.560 --> 46:17.520
♪ I'm hearing sleigh bells ♪

46:17.560 --> 46:21.130

46:52.590 --> 46:55.460
Hey, what happened
to all the flour?

46:55.500 --> 46:57.960
It's all over you.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.170
I guess it is.

47:00.200 --> 47:02.070
We're almost out
of butter, too.

47:02.100 --> 47:03.400
You know what?

47:03.440 --> 47:04.300
Take my keys.

47:04.340 --> 47:05.900
Go on down to my parents'
restaurant.

47:05.940 --> 47:06.870
My mom and dad

47:06.910 --> 47:08.116
will have all the extra
supplies you need.

47:08.140 --> 47:09.640
Zoe,

47:09.680 --> 47:10.986
are you good hanging
here with Allie

47:11.010 --> 47:12.310
for a little while?

47:12.350 --> 47:14.250
Yeah.
bye, dad!

47:15.550 --> 47:16.780
Take that
as a yes.

47:16.820 --> 47:17.950
Have fun!

47:19.320 --> 47:20.120
And
in the meantime,

47:20.150 --> 47:21.520
why don't I teach you

47:21.560 --> 47:22.960
how to decorate
Christmas stockings?

47:23.460 --> 47:24.420
Sure!

47:24.460 --> 47:25.460
Come on!

47:29.730 --> 47:30.800
You got it?

47:30.830 --> 47:32.160
Great, Carol.
Thanks so much.

47:32.200 --> 47:34.170
Bye.

47:34.200 --> 47:35.800
Making cookies
for Santa?

47:35.840 --> 47:37.040
For the festival.

47:37.070 --> 47:38.600
But it's nice
you're doing that.

47:38.640 --> 47:39.786
Oh, it's the least
we could do.

47:39.810 --> 47:41.010
Everyone's been so nice to us,

47:41.040 --> 47:42.710
especially Allie.

47:42.740 --> 47:45.026
I just wish there was something
i could do to return the favor.

47:45.050 --> 47:46.110
Well,

47:46.150 --> 47:48.180
a little bird told me

47:48.220 --> 47:49.650
she doesn't have
a Christmas tree.

47:51.020 --> 47:52.650
No, she doesn't.

47:52.690 --> 47:53.650
Thank you...

47:53.690 --> 47:55.520
Oh, hey...

47:55.560 --> 47:57.320
I didn't catch
your name.

47:57.360 --> 47:58.990
I'm Nick.

47:59.030 --> 48:00.530
Merry Christmas.

48:01.560 --> 48:03.030
Hmm.

48:06.700 --> 48:07.700
You know what?

48:07.740 --> 48:08.700
It's like
we're elves

48:08.740 --> 48:09.900
in Santa's workshop!

48:09.940 --> 48:11.000
You're right!

48:11.040 --> 48:12.670
I told you
this would be fun.

48:12.710 --> 48:13.810
It is.

48:13.840 --> 48:16.210
Be sure to tell
dad, okay?

48:16.240 --> 48:17.580
Why?

48:17.610 --> 48:20.980
He doesn't like me to be sad.

48:21.020 --> 48:23.850
He worries about that a lot
since mom died.

48:23.880 --> 48:25.980
I just like
to let him know

48:26.020 --> 48:27.720
that I'm okay.

48:27.760 --> 48:30.490
But you know it's okay
to be sad sometimes, too, right?

48:30.520 --> 48:31.920
Yeah...

48:31.960 --> 48:34.990
And I am, sometimes...

48:35.030 --> 48:37.260
And so is dad.

48:37.300 --> 48:38.500
Well, I think that's normal...

48:40.600 --> 48:43.370
But also, sometimes
you're happy, right?

48:43.400 --> 48:46.370
Like when you think
about your mom,

48:46.410 --> 48:48.410
you think about fun things
you two would do

48:48.440 --> 48:49.440
during Christmas time?

48:49.480 --> 48:51.180
Yeah.

48:51.210 --> 48:52.410
My favorite was,

48:52.450 --> 48:55.010
we'd find a Christmas thing
for each letter of the alphabet.

48:55.050 --> 48:56.920
Me and dad
play it now.

48:56.950 --> 48:57.920
I love that!

48:57.950 --> 48:59.630
Wait, what would you do
for the letter "z"?

49:01.720 --> 49:02.790
Zoe!

49:04.260 --> 49:05.060
What do you think?

49:05.090 --> 49:07.290
I love it!
Look at this.

49:07.330 --> 49:09.390
Who knew reindeer
liked candy canes?

49:09.430 --> 49:11.030
- I'll glue 'em on.
- 'Kay.

49:12.430 --> 49:13.870
Ooh, that's probably
your dad.

49:14.940 --> 49:16.000
I'll put it on.

49:21.940 --> 49:23.080
Spencer?

49:23.110 --> 49:24.110
Surprise!

49:25.750 --> 49:27.980
How did you get here?

49:28.020 --> 49:29.410
Well...

49:29.450 --> 49:31.080
Remember I told you
i had that partner

49:31.120 --> 49:32.766
who was going to let us use
his helicopter?

49:32.790 --> 49:35.150
You took a helicopter here?

49:35.190 --> 49:37.260
Yep!

49:37.290 --> 49:39.960
Landed just outside of town...
Took a cab here.

49:39.990 --> 49:41.330
I mean, come on,
that's...

49:41.360 --> 49:43.430
That's really
something, hey?

49:43.460 --> 49:45.730
Yeah, that's...
Definitely something.

49:45.770 --> 49:48.430
Look,
I don't totally understand

49:48.470 --> 49:51.000
this whole "one last Christmas
in Evergreen" thing,

49:51.040 --> 49:53.010
but...

49:53.040 --> 49:55.186
I couldn't bear the thought
of not spending it with you,

49:55.210 --> 49:56.310
so here I am.

50:06.150 --> 50:07.490
Perfect.

50:10.660 --> 50:11.720
Sir?

50:22.140 --> 50:24.300
Grr...

50:24.340 --> 50:26.540
Ahh...

50:27.840 --> 50:29.470
Hey, Michelle.

50:29.510 --> 50:31.056
Hannah, why aren't you
home making fruitcake?

50:31.080 --> 50:32.640
You're in charge
of fruitcake.

50:32.680 --> 50:33.850
I finished.

50:33.880 --> 50:35.050
Well, make
something else!

50:35.080 --> 50:36.720
Half the town is cooking.

50:36.750 --> 50:39.790
There's going to be enough food
for, like, five festivals.

50:39.820 --> 50:41.350
There is no such
thing as "enough"

50:41.390 --> 50:42.536
when it comes to
a Christmas feast.

50:42.560 --> 50:43.560
Oh.

50:45.490 --> 50:47.560
Okay, Michelle, um...

50:47.590 --> 50:50.730
Do you want to have
a seat over here?

50:50.760 --> 50:52.800
I think
you need to relax.

50:52.830 --> 50:54.000
I can't.

50:54.030 --> 50:55.070
I have too
much to do.

50:55.100 --> 50:57.040
And there's plenty of time
to get it all done in.

50:57.070 --> 50:58.540
It's going to be fine.

50:58.570 --> 50:59.540
It can't be fine.

50:59.570 --> 51:01.710
It has to be
incredible.

51:01.740 --> 51:03.340
It will be.

51:03.380 --> 51:05.510
You're doing an amazing job.

51:05.550 --> 51:06.410
It's just...

51:06.450 --> 51:09.410
Allie always made
everything look so easy.

51:09.450 --> 51:10.650
Allie had a lot of help.

51:10.680 --> 51:12.480
She didn't try to do
everything by herself.

51:14.350 --> 51:15.350
Yeah.

51:15.390 --> 51:17.060
Okay.

51:17.090 --> 51:18.060
Well, maybe
I should go make a wish

51:18.090 --> 51:19.520
on the Christmas snow globe.

51:20.890 --> 51:22.660
You wouldn't be
the only one.

51:22.700 --> 51:24.730
You made a wish?
What'd you wish for?

51:24.770 --> 51:26.100
Okay.

51:26.130 --> 51:27.030
I don't know
if you know this,

51:27.070 --> 51:29.270
but I just love
Christmas.

51:29.300 --> 51:31.000
No...
I didn't know.

51:32.040 --> 51:33.240
Oh.

51:34.580 --> 51:36.370
Well...

51:36.410 --> 51:37.210
This is going
to sound silly,

51:37.240 --> 51:38.610
but...

51:38.650 --> 51:40.710
I wished to find
someone special,

51:40.750 --> 51:42.350
someone who loves
Christmas

51:42.380 --> 51:44.350
as much as I do.

51:44.380 --> 51:46.690
Well, that's not silly.
That's sweet.

51:46.720 --> 51:47.950
Really?

51:47.990 --> 51:50.920
I just figured,
what could it hurt, right?

51:50.960 --> 51:52.090
I mean,
it's Christmas,

51:52.130 --> 51:53.450
a time when
magical things happen.

51:55.400 --> 51:57.030
How late is that diner open?
Come on.

51:58.300 --> 52:00.200
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

52:00.230 --> 52:04.570
So you just brought this guy
and his kid back here?

52:04.610 --> 52:07.270
Yeah, kind of.

52:07.310 --> 52:09.570
It seemed
like the best option

52:09.610 --> 52:11.580
at the time.

52:11.610 --> 52:13.010
Right.

52:14.410 --> 52:15.496
Listen,
did this have anything to do

52:15.520 --> 52:17.880
with you wanting to stay
in Evergreen for Christmas?

52:17.920 --> 52:19.280
No! no, no, no.

52:19.320 --> 52:21.320
No, that was all me.

52:21.360 --> 52:22.920
Okay.

52:24.290 --> 52:26.120
Oh! dad's back!

52:33.200 --> 52:34.200
Hey!

52:35.840 --> 52:37.240
What do you think?

52:37.270 --> 52:39.570
You got a
Christmas tree!

52:39.610 --> 52:43.110
I can't believe
you got a Christmas tree.

52:43.140 --> 52:44.980
Yeah, well,
it's for...

52:46.210 --> 52:48.680
Oh, this is Spencer.

52:48.720 --> 52:50.980
Spencer, this is Ryan.

52:51.020 --> 52:52.326
Spencer,
Washington, D.C. Spencer?

52:52.350 --> 52:54.420
That's right.

52:54.450 --> 52:56.020
He flew here
on a helicopter.

52:56.060 --> 52:57.590
Really?
Can we borrow it?

52:57.620 --> 52:59.820
Uh, no,
they just dropped me off.

52:59.860 --> 53:01.590
Sorry, who's the tree for?

53:01.630 --> 53:04.330
It's for Barbara,
at the inn.

53:04.360 --> 53:06.300
But we just
got her a tree.

53:06.330 --> 53:07.830
Right, but...

53:07.870 --> 53:11.800
We got her a... a tree
for the... the living room,

53:11.840 --> 53:13.540
and this...
This is a tree for the lobby.

53:13.570 --> 53:14.870
This is
the lobby Christmas tree,

53:14.910 --> 53:16.470
because at Christmas time,

53:16.510 --> 53:18.310
you can never have too many
Christmas trees.

53:18.350 --> 53:19.350
Am I right?

53:19.380 --> 53:20.450
You're right.

53:20.480 --> 53:21.210
So, listen, we should go.

53:21.250 --> 53:22.950
The road might be open
tomorrow,

53:22.980 --> 53:24.480
and, you know,
if that's the case,

53:24.520 --> 53:27.320
we can get ready
to get on out of here.

53:27.350 --> 53:28.996
- Right. Escape from Evergreen!
- That's right.

53:29.020 --> 53:30.060
You know what?

53:30.090 --> 53:32.160
Why don't you take my truck
with the tree in it

53:32.190 --> 53:33.160
to Barbara's house,

53:33.190 --> 53:34.730
and then we can just walk there

53:34.760 --> 53:36.390
and see if she's got
a room for Spencer.

53:36.430 --> 53:37.860
Thank you.
Yeah, that's a good idea.

53:37.900 --> 53:38.960
Spencer,
nice to meet you.

53:39.000 --> 53:40.800
You too.
Bye, Zoe.

53:40.830 --> 53:41.900
Bye.

53:41.940 --> 53:43.540
Great.

53:43.570 --> 53:45.870
Let's go, kiddo.

53:45.910 --> 53:46.970
Get on out of there.

53:47.010 --> 53:47.810
You okay to walk?

53:47.840 --> 53:50.580
Well, it's no helicopter,
but... sure.

53:50.610 --> 53:52.540
Okay, I'll get
my coat.

53:55.680 --> 53:56.750
You know,

53:56.780 --> 53:57.680
you really should have
gotten a tree

53:57.720 --> 53:58.820
for Allie's house.

54:01.190 --> 54:02.690
Yeah.

54:02.720 --> 54:04.020
That would have been nice.

54:04.060 --> 54:05.620
I really like her.

54:08.700 --> 54:10.900
So do I.

54:12.930 --> 54:13.730
Still can't believe

54:13.770 --> 54:15.670
you took a helicopter
to get here.

54:15.700 --> 54:17.270
It's pretty cool, huh?

54:17.300 --> 54:19.700
Doesn't it seem
a little extravagant?

54:19.740 --> 54:21.916
It only seems that way because
you're not used to it yet.

54:21.940 --> 54:23.510
Nah, you know me.

54:23.540 --> 54:25.380
I have simple tastes.

54:25.410 --> 54:27.510
I'm an Evergreen girl.

54:27.550 --> 54:30.620
And now you're going
to be a D.C. girl.

54:30.650 --> 54:31.920
Yeah.

54:31.950 --> 54:33.350
Come on, Allie.

54:33.390 --> 54:34.596
Aren't you just
a little excited

54:34.620 --> 54:35.920
about starting
your new life?

54:35.960 --> 54:37.596
Aren't you happy
to finally be getting out

54:37.620 --> 54:39.220
of this little town?

54:39.260 --> 54:41.360
I love
this place.

54:41.400 --> 54:43.090
I know it might not
seem like much to you,

54:43.130 --> 54:45.530
but this is my hometown.

54:45.570 --> 54:46.600
I mean, look around.

54:46.630 --> 54:48.930
This is what Christmas
is supposed to look like.

54:48.970 --> 54:50.200
I get it, okay?

54:50.240 --> 54:51.416
I know that
you have a soft spot

54:51.440 --> 54:52.600
for this place.

54:52.640 --> 54:53.916
That's why I came
all the way here...

54:53.940 --> 54:54.940
To be with you.

54:54.980 --> 54:56.710
I know,
and I appreciate that,

54:56.740 --> 54:57.680
but...

54:57.710 --> 54:59.680
Aren't we supposed to be
taking things slow?

55:01.280 --> 55:02.610
That's why I had to see you.

55:04.320 --> 55:07.490
I don't need
to take things slow.

55:07.520 --> 55:08.950
I know what I want.

55:08.990 --> 55:10.890
The question is...

55:10.920 --> 55:13.460
Do you?

55:31.580 --> 55:33.040
Hey, uh,
how's it going?

55:33.080 --> 55:34.050
Hey.

55:34.080 --> 55:36.150
Was just checking
on some flights to D.C. here.

55:36.180 --> 55:37.580
Coffee?

55:37.620 --> 55:39.480
You're not taking
the helicopter back?

55:39.520 --> 55:41.020
No, no, no.

55:41.050 --> 55:43.660
That's a, uh,
favor we can only use one time.

55:43.690 --> 55:45.760
Oh. we?

55:45.790 --> 55:48.090
I thought Allie was staying here
for Christmas.

55:48.130 --> 55:50.160
Uh, yeah, well, she was,
but we spoke last night,

55:50.200 --> 55:51.000
and I'm kind of hoping
she might change her mind,

55:51.030 --> 55:53.100
so...

55:53.130 --> 55:55.930
Oh.
Well, that's, uh...

55:55.970 --> 55:56.940
That's good.

55:56.970 --> 55:58.440
Yeah.

55:58.470 --> 56:00.570
Yeah, I think
that once we get to D.C.

56:00.610 --> 56:02.040
And she gets settled
into her job,

56:02.080 --> 56:04.740
It's going to be...
smooth sailing, so...

56:07.550 --> 56:08.510
Hello.

56:08.550 --> 56:10.180
There she is!

56:11.080 --> 56:12.050
Hi.

56:12.090 --> 56:13.090
Hi.

56:13.120 --> 56:14.690
- Hey.
- Hey.

56:15.790 --> 56:16.590
Hi.

56:16.620 --> 56:17.990
Hi.

56:22.760 --> 56:24.520
Why is everybody
just standing around?

56:27.230 --> 56:29.470
Uh, we should go...
To the diner.

56:29.500 --> 56:30.700
Ezra was going
to stop by

56:30.740 --> 56:32.200
and give us an update
of the roads...

56:32.240 --> 56:33.480
On the roads...
About the roads.

56:34.610 --> 56:36.110
Whatever.

56:38.450 --> 56:39.410
Great.

56:39.450 --> 56:40.450
Yeah...

56:40.480 --> 56:42.210
Um... 'Kay.

56:42.250 --> 56:44.080
'Kay.

56:46.620 --> 56:47.520
Listen up,
everybody.

56:47.550 --> 56:49.950
I have an update on
the road situation.

56:49.990 --> 56:50.990
Is it open?

56:51.020 --> 56:52.060
It's not...

56:54.530 --> 56:55.990
But...

56:56.030 --> 56:57.330
It will be
by tomorrow night,

56:57.360 --> 56:59.400
so we can have
the Christmas Eve festival

56:59.430 --> 57:01.100
the next day as planned!

57:03.370 --> 57:04.370
Whoo-hoo!

57:06.110 --> 57:07.140
Thank you.

57:07.170 --> 57:08.410
You're going to love it.

57:10.040 --> 57:11.640
Spencer flew in
on a helicopter?

57:11.680 --> 57:12.980
Oh, mom, don't start.

57:13.010 --> 57:14.486
I thought you said
it wasn't a big deal?

57:14.510 --> 57:15.410
That's big.

57:15.450 --> 57:16.410
It's not.

57:16.450 --> 57:18.950
It was a small
helicopter.

57:18.990 --> 57:20.420
What about Ryan?

57:20.450 --> 57:21.450
What about Ryan?

57:21.490 --> 57:22.490
Allison Louise,

57:22.520 --> 57:23.420
I can tell
there's something

57:23.460 --> 57:24.860
between you two.

57:24.890 --> 57:26.160
It's not.
There's nothing.

57:26.190 --> 57:27.190
There's nothing
happening,

57:27.230 --> 57:28.590
and it's no big deal.

57:31.160 --> 57:32.160
So, that's good news!

57:32.200 --> 57:33.100
You'll be able
to head to Florida

57:33.130 --> 57:34.370
after all.

57:34.400 --> 57:36.130
Yes, yeah,
that's great news.

57:36.170 --> 57:37.170
Right, Zoe?

57:37.200 --> 57:38.300
Isn't that
great news?

57:38.340 --> 57:39.670
Yeah, it's great.

57:42.710 --> 57:44.480
I'm counting on you!

57:47.580 --> 57:48.896
Well, this is terrific.

57:48.920 --> 57:50.326
I mean, if the road opens
by tomorrow night,

57:50.350 --> 57:52.066
we can still make it to D.C.
for Christmas...

57:52.090 --> 57:53.666
I mean, if we decide
that's what we want to do,

57:53.690 --> 57:54.720
of course.

57:54.750 --> 57:56.650
Right. we just
have to decide.

57:56.690 --> 57:57.520
Right.

57:57.560 --> 57:58.560
Well...

57:58.590 --> 58:00.366
Since we'll all be here
at least a little longer,

58:00.390 --> 58:01.390
what do you want to do?

58:01.430 --> 58:02.430
Good afternoon.

58:03.930 --> 58:06.870
Beautiful weather
for ice skating.

58:06.900 --> 58:07.870
Can we go ice skating?

58:07.900 --> 58:08.900
Oh!

58:08.940 --> 58:09.870
Well, that sounds fun.

58:09.900 --> 58:11.316
You know, there's
a gorgeous ice skating rink

58:11.340 --> 58:12.840
in town.

58:12.870 --> 58:14.640
- Shall we all go?
- Yeah!

58:14.670 --> 58:15.540
That sounds great, yeah.
Why not?

58:15.580 --> 58:16.470
I would love to,

58:16.510 --> 58:17.340
but I've actually got
a conference call,

58:17.380 --> 58:18.586
and it could take
a couple of hours...

58:18.610 --> 58:19.540
But you guys go ahead,

58:19.580 --> 58:20.750
and I'll just...

58:20.780 --> 58:21.750
I'll catch up with you later.

58:21.780 --> 58:22.680
Wait, really?
Are you sure?

58:22.720 --> 58:23.650
Yeah.

58:23.680 --> 58:25.350
- Okay.
- Okay.

58:25.390 --> 58:28.450
Well, now we just need
to find y'all some skates.

58:29.460 --> 58:30.890
Yes!

58:30.920 --> 58:33.830
I know!
It's sliding on the ice.

58:33.860 --> 58:36.160
This is a lot of fun.
I have not skated in forever.

58:36.200 --> 58:37.200
Years!

58:37.230 --> 58:38.160
For me,
it's been years.

58:38.200 --> 58:39.260
Has it?

58:39.300 --> 58:41.200
So a lot more
recently than you.

58:41.230 --> 58:41.970
I'm going
to take a break.

58:42.000 --> 58:43.700
Okay, I'm going
to do that, too.

58:43.740 --> 58:45.100
All right, have fun, Zoe!

58:45.140 --> 58:46.600
I feel like
I'm flying!

58:48.240 --> 58:50.110
Does she ever get tired?

58:50.140 --> 58:51.740
She would stay out here
all night

58:51.780 --> 58:53.610
if we let her.

58:53.650 --> 58:54.580
How can there be
that much energy

58:54.610 --> 58:55.780
in that tiny little body?

58:55.820 --> 58:58.020
Medically speaking,
it's impossible.

58:58.050 --> 58:58.950
Nobody knows.

59:01.920 --> 59:02.920
Yeah...

59:05.060 --> 59:06.020
Everything okay?

59:06.060 --> 59:08.890
What? yeah. Great.

59:08.930 --> 59:10.600
'Cause if you want
to go be with Spencer,

59:10.630 --> 59:11.600
I totally get it.

59:11.630 --> 59:13.460
Oh, no, um,
this is fun,

59:13.500 --> 59:14.730
and he's working anyway.

59:14.770 --> 59:16.430
It's fine.

59:16.470 --> 59:18.200
He seems like
a good guy.

59:19.340 --> 59:20.870
He is.

59:23.580 --> 59:24.910
You know,
I always...

59:27.580 --> 59:28.910
I always thought

59:28.950 --> 59:30.750
that we were
in the same place

59:30.780 --> 59:32.080
even though we lived
far apart.

59:33.850 --> 59:35.250
We always saw things
the same way,

59:35.290 --> 59:36.250
wanted the same things,

59:36.290 --> 59:38.590
but...

59:38.630 --> 59:40.750
Now that we're going to be
living in the same place...

59:42.660 --> 59:44.560
I don't know
if that's true anymore.

59:45.970 --> 59:47.100
What do you want?

59:48.640 --> 59:51.000
I mean, like,
for Christmas.

59:51.040 --> 59:52.440
Like, like...
What's your wishlist

59:52.470 --> 59:53.640
for Santa?

59:55.310 --> 59:56.270
A pony.

59:56.310 --> 59:57.180
Ah.

59:57.210 --> 59:59.480
Probably more reliable
than your truck.

59:59.510 --> 01:00:01.010
Hey, don't knock
my truck.

01:00:01.050 --> 01:00:02.250
That's
my grandpa's truck.

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:03.180
I love that truck.

01:00:07.050 --> 01:00:08.590
So, to answer
your question,

01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:09.650
what do I want...

01:00:09.690 --> 01:00:11.160
Um...

01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:12.720
I think I want...

01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:18.030
To always feel

01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:20.670
the way that I do
here in Evergreen.

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:22.270
The feeling of home.

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:26.170
Exactly.

01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:30.840
So, how about you?

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:31.880
What do you want?

01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:34.880
That.

01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:36.850
- I can fly!
- Right there.

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:38.280
That's all I need.

01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:48.390
Come on, guys!

01:00:49.830 --> 01:00:50.630
I'm going to go
check to see

01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:51.706
if she has a battery
pack or something.

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.560
Yeah. I've got
a phone call.

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:56.330
Oh, it's Hannah. Hey!

01:00:56.370 --> 01:00:58.000
Whoa, what's going on?

01:00:58.040 --> 01:00:59.770
Yeah, he's right here.

01:01:01.410 --> 01:01:02.810
Okay, all right.

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.840
Yeah, we'll be there
as soon as we can.

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:05.910
Okay, bye.

01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:07.080
Is everything okay?

01:01:07.110 --> 01:01:09.610
I'm so sorry to do this to you,
but we need a doctor.

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:14.020
Okay, so, what happened?

01:01:14.050 --> 01:01:15.390
I don't know.

01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:16.220
We were working
on the festival,

01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:18.020
and then she started
to get all woozy.

01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:19.020
Is she going to be okay?

01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:20.320
No, I'm not okay.

01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:21.990
Honey, just give
us a moment, okay?

01:01:22.030 --> 01:01:22.860
Okay.

01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:23.760
Thanks.

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:24.876
And the barn,
and then outside,

01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:25.930
and in two days,

01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:27.506
there's not enough time,
and we're supposed to be...

01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:28.270
Okay, Michelle,
Michelle...

01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:30.670
Just need you
to breathe, okay?

01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:32.040
I don't have time
to breathe!

01:01:32.070 --> 01:01:34.040
Michelle,

01:01:34.070 --> 01:01:35.516
do you remember
the twelve days of Christmas?

01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:37.510
♪ On the twelfth day
of Christmas ♪

01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:39.110
♪ my true love gave to me ♪

01:01:39.150 --> 01:01:40.180
What was it?

01:01:40.210 --> 01:01:41.350
Drummers.

01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:42.396
Twelve drummers
drumming, right?

01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:44.126
That's right, that's right.
Okay, what's next?

01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:46.120
Pipers piping.
Eleven.

01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:47.420
Great, okay.
Keep going.

01:01:47.450 --> 01:01:49.020
I don't know ten.
I don't know it.

01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:50.250
Lords.

01:01:50.290 --> 01:01:51.296
Lords.
ten lords a-leaping.

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:52.520
Um... uh...

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:56.030
Then it's nine
ladies dancing,

01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:57.030
and eight maids
a-milking, right?

01:01:57.060 --> 01:01:58.460
Swans, geese,

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:01.730
uh, five golden rings,

01:02:01.770 --> 01:02:03.940
four calling birds,

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:05.200
three French hens,

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:12.880
Great.
How do you feel?

01:02:12.910 --> 01:02:14.650
Better.

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:16.250
What'd you do?

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:17.496
You were having a panic attack,

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:18.766
and counting
is one of the things

01:02:18.790 --> 01:02:20.150
that can alleviate it.

01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:22.350
I just thought we'd stick
to a Christmas theme.

01:02:26.090 --> 01:02:27.290
Are you okay?

01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:29.830
Yes, I am. I just...

01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:32.130
I was really crazy
to think that I could do this

01:02:32.170 --> 01:02:34.230
as well as you've done
for so long.

01:02:34.270 --> 01:02:37.300
Oh, don't say that.
This is amazing.

01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:38.586
Hey, let me
tell you something.

01:02:38.610 --> 01:02:40.270
I have never seen
a group of people

01:02:40.310 --> 01:02:42.340
more dedicated
to anything in my life.

01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:44.680
The way you have pulled
everyone together

01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:46.140
and turned this place
into...

01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:47.650
I mean, come on,
look at this!

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:49.180
This is what
Christmas is all about.

01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:50.580
It's true.

01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:52.020
The festival
is going to be great...

01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:55.050
And it's all because of you.

01:02:56.190 --> 01:02:57.190
Thanks, doc.

01:03:12.110 --> 01:03:14.070
Hello, you two.

01:03:14.110 --> 01:03:15.410
Homemade
Christmas cookies.

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:17.610
Thank you very much.

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:18.886
Allie's a very good
Baker, too, by the way.

01:03:18.910 --> 01:03:20.340
Oh!

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:22.750
Yes...

01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:24.080
Hey, everybody!

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.850
Ezra just called,

01:03:25.890 --> 01:03:27.350
and great news...

01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:28.636
The road will be cleared
tonight!

01:03:29.490 --> 01:03:30.690
Yes!

01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:39.430
I thought we had a deal.

01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:41.030
What's wrong, Zoe?

01:03:41.070 --> 01:03:43.700
Well, I made a wish
on the snow globe,

01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:45.370
and I thought
it was coming true,

01:03:45.410 --> 01:03:47.240
but now I'm not so sure.

01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:48.740
Oh.

01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:51.380
Well, was it something
your heart truly wanted?

01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:52.540
Yes!

01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:54.610
My whole body wanted it,
even my toes.

01:03:54.650 --> 01:03:55.710
Ha ha ha!

01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:57.080
In that case,

01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:59.120
I don't think you have
anything to worry about.

01:03:59.150 --> 01:04:00.920
Are you sure?

01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:02.750
I'm sure.

01:04:02.790 --> 01:04:04.320
You just have to be patient.

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:06.960
Wishes are like
Christmas cookies.

01:04:06.990 --> 01:04:10.090
It sometimes takes a while
for them to be fully baked.

01:04:11.970 --> 01:04:12.970
Zoe?

01:04:13.930 --> 01:04:14.900
Hi.

01:04:14.930 --> 01:04:16.170
Hi!

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:18.570
Kiddo, our cocoa's
getting cold.

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:21.940
What about you, Ryan?

01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:24.610
Have you changed your mind
about making a Christmas wish?

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:26.410
Uh, no.

01:04:26.450 --> 01:04:29.150
No, I don't really believe
in that sort of thing.

01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:31.780
You know, people get busy,

01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:34.120
and they forget about the magic
of the holidays,

01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:35.120
but all they
have to do

01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:36.820
is stop for
a moment

01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:38.190
and open
their eyes...

01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:40.460
Because that magic...

01:04:40.490 --> 01:04:41.560
it's all around us.

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:30.240
So you can just take
the truck

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:31.680
and return the keys
to Barbara.

01:05:31.710 --> 01:05:32.680
Okay, thanks.

01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:34.010
Yeah, mm-hmm.

01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:38.420
This really is a special place.

01:05:38.450 --> 01:05:39.650
Yeah.

01:05:39.690 --> 01:05:41.190
It really is.

01:05:44.290 --> 01:05:46.160
So, you're all set?

01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:48.490
We are, yeah.

01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:50.160
Off to Florida.

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:51.376
And that's
what you wanted, right?

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.530
Yeah...

01:05:53.570 --> 01:05:55.270
And you,
you're off to D.C.?

01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:57.400
Yeah.
that's the plan.

01:05:58.770 --> 01:06:00.670
Looks like we both got
what we wanted.

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.640
Looks like it.

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:08.580
Ryan...

01:06:12.890 --> 01:06:14.420
Merry Christmas.

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:18.890
Merry Christmas.

01:06:20.830 --> 01:06:22.230
Allie...

01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:24.230
I... I wanted to...

01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:25.300
Um...

01:06:25.330 --> 01:06:26.960
Hey!
Allie!

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.530
Will you promise
to send me

01:06:28.570 --> 01:06:30.130
pictures of
the festival?

01:06:30.170 --> 01:06:32.100
I want to see the
stockings, the choir,

01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:33.370
and the tree.

01:06:33.410 --> 01:06:34.910
Don't forget the tree.

01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:36.640
Well, I won't,
i promise.

01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:39.880
It's the only tree
i have this year!

01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:41.110
Merry Christmas, Zoe.

01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:42.750
Merry Christmas,
Allie.

01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:49.250
Merry Christmas, Ryan.

01:06:49.290 --> 01:06:51.920
Merry Christmas, Allie.

01:06:57.830 --> 01:06:59.160
Dad?

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.330
Yeah?

01:07:00.370 --> 01:07:02.246
Where is Santa going to leave
all of Allie's presents

01:07:02.270 --> 01:07:03.970
if she doesn't even have a tree?

01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:25.120
Good evening.

01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:26.160
Good evening.

01:07:28.490 --> 01:07:30.160
Are you ready
for the Christmas festival?

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:31.930
Yes, I am.

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:32.976
Ready
for the Christmas festival.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.100
Are you?

01:07:34.130 --> 01:07:37.840
I'm definitely ready
for Christmas.

01:07:37.870 --> 01:07:40.600
It's a time
when wishes come true.

01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:44.280
I always thought that.

01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:45.710
But you don't anymore?

01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:48.950
No, I, I'll always believe
in Christmas wishes,

01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:51.220
but...

01:07:51.250 --> 01:07:52.726
What if you don't know
what to wish for?

01:07:52.750 --> 01:07:54.790
Is this about
leaving Evergreen?

01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:55.820
Ah...

01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:57.350
Or Spencer?

01:07:57.390 --> 01:07:58.360
How did you know that?

01:07:58.390 --> 01:08:00.390
It's amazing what you learn

01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:02.190
sitting at a table
in the town diner.

01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:03.830
Oh, right.
Of course.

01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:06.130
Um...

01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:08.570
Well, I think it's...
it's kind of about both.

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:11.370
So what did you wish for
on the snow globe?

01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:12.440
Well, I wished

01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:14.470
that everyone that I love
have a Merry Christmas,

01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:16.470
even though
we can't be together.

01:08:16.510 --> 01:08:18.640
And yet here you are,
in Evergreen,

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:20.040
with all the people you love.

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:22.710
But I'm supposed
to be in Washington, D.C.

01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:24.256
The further away you are
from where you started...

01:08:24.279 --> 01:08:28.649
The closer you get
to where you belong.

01:08:28.689 --> 01:08:31.819
Sometimes, you end up
right back where you started

01:08:31.859 --> 01:08:34.729
because that's the place
you're supposed to be.

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:39.729
Oh, my dear.

01:08:39.770 --> 01:08:41.229
Oh...

01:08:41.270 --> 01:08:42.630
There, there.

01:08:48.979 --> 01:08:50.710
Good night.

01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:51.880
Good night.

01:09:08.790 --> 01:09:10.229
Hey!

01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:11.760
Spencer,
what are you doing here?

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:12.760
Well, I wanted
to stop by.

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:14.276
I figure if we leave
first thing in the morning,

01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:15.870
we can still get
to the airport

01:09:15.899 --> 01:09:17.776
and make it to the firm's
Christmas Eve party on time.

01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:19.040
The swanky one?

01:09:19.069 --> 01:09:20.569
Yeah, the swanky one.

01:09:20.609 --> 01:09:21.770
Um...

01:09:23.279 --> 01:09:24.310
Allie, what's wrong?

01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:25.710
Don't you want
to go to D.C.?

01:09:27.010 --> 01:09:28.149
I'm so sorry,
Spencer.

01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:29.950
I think
i want to stay here.

01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:33.279
For Christmas, or...?

01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:35.450
For Christmas and...

01:09:35.490 --> 01:09:36.490
I don't know...

01:09:37.859 --> 01:09:40.319
But why don't you
stay here for Christmas?

01:09:40.359 --> 01:09:43.990
I love this place,
and I love these people,

01:09:44.029 --> 01:09:45.960
and I want you
to understand why.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.800
Allie, I love Washington, D.C.,

01:09:48.830 --> 01:09:51.100
and I love my job,

01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:54.940
and the people that I work with
are really great.

01:09:54.970 --> 01:09:56.440
I mean, that's where I belong.

01:09:58.210 --> 01:09:59.626
Spencer, I don't think
it was just the distance

01:09:59.650 --> 01:10:01.580
that was getting in our way.

01:10:01.610 --> 01:10:03.910
Allie, don't do this, okay?
Please.

01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:07.280
You do belong
in Washington, D.C.,

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:08.590
and I don't.

01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:09.690
I belong here.

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:11.790
But what about your new job?

01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:14.360
I love my job here.

01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:17.190
I get to take care
of tiny little puppies,

01:10:17.230 --> 01:10:18.930
and I get to birth calves.

01:10:18.970 --> 01:10:19.970
That's incredible...

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.700
And I have family
and friends

01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:25.600
and Christmas
in a place that I love.

01:10:26.970 --> 01:10:28.046
Listen,
I think you're just nervous

01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:29.540
about making such a big change.

01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:30.656
Well, see, that's the thing.

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:34.140
I think I thought I was ready
for this big change,

01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:35.150
and I am,

01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:36.956
but I think I thought
I had to leave Evergreen

01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:38.220
in order to find it.

01:10:38.250 --> 01:10:42.390
I kept telling myself
I needed more.

01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:47.360
Everything I needed
was right here all along.

01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:50.330
What can I do to convince you
that I'm right about this?

01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:53.930
I think you'd be trying
to convince yourself.

01:11:02.210 --> 01:11:03.210
Merry Christmas, Spencer.

01:11:05.410 --> 01:11:06.680
Merry Christmas, Allie.

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:46.080
Allie...
Zoe was worried

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:49.420
that Santa might not have
a place to put your presents

01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:51.690
if you didn't have a tree.

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:54.530
We hope you get everything
you want for Christmas...

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:56.560
Even the pony.

01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:59.700
Thank you for everything.

01:11:59.730 --> 01:12:02.230
Ryan and Zoe.

01:12:15.610 --> 01:12:17.650
Home sweet home.

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:18.520
Hi, mom.

01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:19.920
Welcome back, Frank.

01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:20.980
So...

01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:22.190
Have you
talked to him?

01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:23.620
Oh, he went back to D.C.

01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:25.260
Oh, honey, not Spencer.

01:12:25.290 --> 01:12:26.320
Ryan.

01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:27.520
Why would I talk to Ryan?

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:30.860
Allie, he bought you a tree!

01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:32.430
In fact, he bought
you two trees,

01:12:32.470 --> 01:12:34.160
if you count the one
at Barbara's.

01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:35.470
Mom, it is not like that.

01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:37.700
I know.

01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:38.770
I know...

01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:42.510
And, uh,

01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:43.340
I'm not saying

01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:44.686
that whatever happened
with Spencer

01:12:44.710 --> 01:12:45.756
had anything
to do with Ryan.

01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:49.550
I mean, those are two
totally different things,

01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:51.650
but Allie...

01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:54.320
They are both things,

01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:55.690
and I just want
to make sure

01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:57.020
that you're...

01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:00.660
Okay with how
both of them ended.

01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:07.930
They might not have left yet.

01:13:09.670 --> 01:13:10.870
I love you.

01:13:14.110 --> 01:13:15.970
Hurry!

01:13:20.350 --> 01:13:22.150
Hello?

01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:23.210
Allie!

01:13:23.250 --> 01:13:24.420
Hi, what are you
doing here?

01:13:24.450 --> 01:13:27.020
I was just hoping to catch
Ryan and Zoe before they left.

01:13:27.050 --> 01:13:28.250
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.

01:13:28.290 --> 01:13:30.150
The cab picked them up
about an hour ago.

01:13:30.190 --> 01:13:31.720
They're probably
at the airport by now.

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:32.760
Oh.

01:13:36.460 --> 01:13:37.290
Ladies and gentlemen

01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:39.860
in the boarding area
for flight 993,

01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:41.000
we have been informed

01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:42.746
that there is a small
mechanical issue on the plane,

01:13:42.770 --> 01:13:44.170
and we need to delay boarding.

01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.770
I apologize
for the inconvenience.

01:13:46.810 --> 01:13:48.910
Boy, that sounds familiar, huh?

01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:51.380
We should go back
to Evergreen.

01:13:51.410 --> 01:13:52.410
Zoe, the flight's
delayed.

01:13:52.450 --> 01:13:53.450
It isn't canceled.

01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:54.550
So if it gets canceled,

01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:56.280
we can go back
to Evergreen?

01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:57.920
No, honey.

01:13:57.950 --> 01:13:59.750
I want a ruling
from the judges.

01:13:59.790 --> 01:14:01.220
Sorry, kiddo.

01:14:01.250 --> 01:14:02.220
They're with me
on this one.

01:14:02.250 --> 01:14:03.750
Don't you miss it already?

01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:06.390
Don't you miss Allie?

01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:11.060
She isn't
mine to miss.

01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:12.500

Congratulations,
Michelle!

01:14:59.810 --> 01:15:01.010
Aw, thanks.

01:15:01.050 --> 01:15:02.980
I think we actually
pulled it off,

01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:03.850
with the help of
a snow globe, of course...

01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:04.950
Of course.

01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:06.150
And Hanna,
what about you?

01:15:06.190 --> 01:15:07.850
Any developments
on this wish you had?

01:15:07.890 --> 01:15:09.090
Oh, no!

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:10.496
It was just a silly
little wish, anyway.

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:11.460
Oh, I'm so sorry!

01:15:11.490 --> 01:15:12.490
Sorry.

01:15:12.530 --> 01:15:14.830
Hey!

01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:15.960
I'm Hannah.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Charlie.

01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:18.530
Hi.

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:19.646
Did you want to get
some hot chocolate

01:15:19.670 --> 01:15:21.770
or apple cider?

01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:23.430
Yeah,
I'd love that.

01:15:23.470 --> 01:15:24.940
Great.

01:15:24.970 --> 01:15:26.800
Oh, Merry
Christmas, everyone!

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:28.640
Oh, it's just magical.

01:15:28.670 --> 01:15:29.840
Merry Christmas.

01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:30.670
Henry, thank
you so much

01:15:30.710 --> 01:15:32.680
for letting us
have the festival here.

01:15:32.710 --> 01:15:34.110
You saved Christmas!

01:15:34.150 --> 01:15:35.210
Oh, no.

01:15:35.250 --> 01:15:36.250
You think?

01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:39.550
Michelle, everything
looks amazing.

01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:40.820
Oh, thanks.

01:15:40.850 --> 01:15:43.020
Isn't it amazing, Ezra?

01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:46.020
Well, actually, there's...

01:15:49.930 --> 01:15:51.400
Not a single thing
I'd change.

01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:53.900
There you go.

01:15:53.930 --> 01:15:55.530
And I just heard
the great news

01:15:55.570 --> 01:15:56.470
that Evergreen's
veterinarian

01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:57.530
is staying put.

01:15:57.570 --> 01:16:00.840
Yes...
yes, she is.

01:16:00.870 --> 01:16:02.656
Just wish we could've convinced
that doctor to stay.

01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:03.740
Yeah...

01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:05.440
Me too.

01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:08.510
He's probably in Florida
by now.

01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:12.450
Ho, ho, ho!

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:16.550
Merry Christmas!

01:16:17.890 --> 01:16:19.220
Whoo-hoo!

01:16:22.530 --> 01:16:24.490
Santa has presents!

01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:26.060
Children first.

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:33.340
It shouldn't be
too much longer, kiddo.

01:16:33.370 --> 01:16:35.170
It's okay, dad.

01:16:35.210 --> 01:16:36.110
I'm going to go
see what's going on.

01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:37.140
I'll be right back.

01:16:40.410 --> 01:16:41.710
Thank you.

01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:42.610
- Oh... Spencer?
- Hey.

01:16:42.650 --> 01:16:44.050
Hey.

01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:45.280
What are you doing here?

01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:46.366
Uh, still trying
to get to Florida.

01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:47.450
You? Same?

01:16:47.490 --> 01:16:50.290
Yeah, still trying
to get to D.C.

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:51.396
Seems like all the flights
are booked, though.

01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:52.460
Yeah.

01:16:52.490 --> 01:16:54.560
Is, um, Allie here?

01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:56.530
Uh, no.

01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:59.030
No, she's, uh...
She's staying in Evergreen...

01:16:59.060 --> 01:16:59.960
Permanently.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.730
Oh.

01:17:01.770 --> 01:17:03.530
Um... I'm really sorry.

01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:06.200
Thanks. I...

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:07.170
Thank you.

01:17:07.210 --> 01:17:09.340
Well, I'm going to try
the other airlines,

01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:11.110
see if I have
any better luck.

01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:12.110
Uh, Merry Christmas.

01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:13.140
Yeah, Merry Christmas.

01:17:28.130 --> 01:17:29.760
What's wrong, dad?

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:32.430
Nothing.

01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:33.930
This Christmas...

01:17:33.970 --> 01:17:35.630
It's been the best!

01:17:35.670 --> 01:17:37.130
Really?
you think so?

01:17:37.170 --> 01:17:39.870
It felt like Christmas again.

01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:40.910
Like before mom.

01:17:43.410 --> 01:17:45.510
Yeah.

01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:48.480
I guess...
I guess it did.

01:17:48.510 --> 01:17:51.150
I just don't understand
why the snow globe didn't work.

01:17:51.180 --> 01:17:53.720
What did you wish for?

01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:56.620
That we could have
Christmas in Evergreen...

01:17:56.660 --> 01:17:58.420
But Florida will be great, too.

01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:03.560
Did you make a wish?

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:05.830
I did.

01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:07.630
I wished for a Merry Christmas.

01:18:07.670 --> 01:18:08.930
And did it come true?

01:18:10.570 --> 01:18:12.540
Zoe, as long as I'm with you,

01:18:12.570 --> 01:18:15.140
it is going to be
a very Merry Christmas.

01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:19.010
So your wish came true.

01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:22.610
I wonder
why mine didn't?

01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:26.266
Attention in the gate area,

01:18:26.290 --> 01:18:29.320
all passengers
for flight 967 to Orlando.

01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:30.350
I'm sorry to tell you

01:18:30.390 --> 01:18:31.696
that we are having
some mechanical difficulties

01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:32.490
with the airplane,

01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:34.390
and at this point,
it looks like

01:18:34.430 --> 01:18:36.190
we are going to have
to cancel the flight.

01:19:06.130 --> 01:19:08.190
Merry Christmas,
Allie.

01:19:08.230 --> 01:19:09.560
Oh, Merry Christmas, Santa.

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:11.190
You were great
in there.

01:19:11.230 --> 01:19:12.630
The kids love you.

01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:15.070
They are the true spirit
of Christmas...

01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:16.730
But I have to ask you,

01:19:16.770 --> 01:19:19.040
did your Christmas wish
come true?

01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:21.770
Oh, I think it did.

01:19:21.810 --> 01:19:24.740
Yeah, maybe not in the way
that I'd hoped, but...

01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:26.380
I think I learned something.

01:19:26.410 --> 01:19:27.610
And what's that, my dear?

01:19:27.650 --> 01:19:31.150
Sometimes, you end up exactly
where you're supposed to be.

01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:32.020
I guess

01:19:32.050 --> 01:19:33.880
that's why it's called
Christmas magic.

01:19:35.150 --> 01:19:36.950
Maybe.

01:19:36.990 --> 01:19:38.290
Can I offer you a ride
into town?

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:39.420
No.

01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:41.160
I have my own transportation.

01:19:41.190 --> 01:19:42.630
Okay.

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:45.330
Allie!

01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:47.430
You came back!

01:19:47.470 --> 01:19:49.070
We missed you.

01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:51.430
I missed you, too.

01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:56.040
Zoe?
You're here.

01:19:57.710 --> 01:19:59.150
Do you want to be
in the choir still?

01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:00.680
We go on in
a couple minutes.

01:20:00.710 --> 01:20:02.110
Can I, dad?

01:20:02.150 --> 01:20:03.710
Go have fun.

01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:06.980
What are you doing here?

01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:09.350
Heard you may be looking
for a small-town doctor.

01:20:09.390 --> 01:20:10.850
Oh, careful.

01:20:10.890 --> 01:20:12.296
You don't want Ezra
to hear you say that.

01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:13.820
He'll never let you leave.

01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:16.460
Did your flight get
canceled again?

01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:18.160
Yes...

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:19.600
But that's not
why we came back.

01:20:20.630 --> 01:20:21.600
It's not?

01:20:21.630 --> 01:20:22.470
No.

01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:25.500
This has been
a completely unexpected,

01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:28.170
amazing, magical Christmas

01:20:28.210 --> 01:20:30.140
for both Zoe and me...

01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:32.810
Because of you.

01:20:32.850 --> 01:20:35.450
I'm not moving
to Washington D.C.

01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:36.810
I know.

01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:38.780
How?

01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:40.620
Because this is where
you're supposed to be...

01:20:41.550 --> 01:20:42.720
And Allie,

01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:44.696
I don't know if this is where
I'm supposed to be or not,

01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:46.120
but...

01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:47.960
I need to find out.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.530
Because something

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:55.500
keeps bringing me back here.

01:20:56.840 --> 01:21:00.140
Is it...
a magical Christmas snow globe?

01:21:00.170 --> 01:21:01.710
Maybe.

01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:25.000
Ho, ho, ho!

The Christmas feast
that year

01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:26.790
was truly special.

01:22:26.830 --> 01:22:30.460
Surrounded by family and friends
old and new,

01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:34.260
the spirit of the holidays
was all around them,

01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:35.800
and it lived on

01:22:35.830 --> 01:22:38.570
