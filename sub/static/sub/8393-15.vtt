ADMINISTERED

00:16.740 --> 00:18.048
THE WAY WE SEE FIT,

00:18.150 --> 00:18.764

YOU'RE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT
THAT YOU WANT TO EAT AT

00:44.520 --> 00:45.862

00:53.390 --> 00:55.039
AND EAT AT THE CHEF'S TABLE.

00:55.150 --> 00:55.639
I HEAR THAT'S THE THING

IT'S SUPER COOL,

00:59.680 --> 01:00.601
SUPER EXPENSIVE,

01:00.710 --> 01:01.779
AND REALLY HARD
TO GET A RESERVATION.

01:01.880 --> 01:02.847

YEAH.

01:02.950 --> 01:05.839
NOT TO MENTION
YOU GO THERE

AMAZING FOOD...

THEN YOU GOTTA SIT ON THE BRIDGE

ON THE WAY HOME.

01:11.200 --> 01:13.065

01:13.170 --> 01:14.546

01:15.830 --> 01:17.889
NOW, THIS IS CRAZY TALK,

01:18.000 --> 01:20.275
BUT, LIKE, MAYBE IF YOU HAD
A SUITE AT THE W HOTEL,

01:20.390 --> 01:21.618
OVERLOOKING THE BAY.

01:21.730 --> 01:23.288
THEN MAYBE IT WOULD ALMOST BE
WORTH IT TO GO.

01:23.390 --> 01:26.598
- YEAH, MAYBE.
- [slurping]

01:26.700 --> 01:28.213
WELL, WE WOULD NEED SOMETHING
REALLY IMPORTANT

01:28.320 --> 01:30.527
TO CELEBRATE, THOUGH, IN ORDER
TO JUSTIFY THAT EXPENSE.

01:30.640 --> 01:32.153
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T EVEN THINK
OF WHAT IT COULD BE.

01:32.260 --> 01:34.148
LIKE, MAYBE LIKE
AN ANNIVERSARY OR SOMETHING.

01:34.260 --> 01:35.329
- OUR ANNIVERSARY.

01:35.440 --> 01:36.600
THAT'S WHAT I GOT US!
- NO, YOU DIDN'T.

01:36.710 --> 01:37.847

WE'RE GONNA EAT THERE,

01:37.950 --> 01:39.918

01:44.060 --> 01:46.267
OH. WELL, WHAT ABOUT JABBAR?

01:46.380 --> 01:48.234
WE NEED A BABYSITTER.

01:48.340 --> 01:49.068

01:49.170 --> 01:51.309
SHE CAN AT LEAST BABY-SIT.

01:51.420 --> 01:52.819
IT'S LIKE THE ONE SILVER LINING.
- YEAH, BUT YOU MESSED THAT UP

01:52.940 --> 01:54.271
WHEN YOU DIDN'T APOLOGIZE
TO HER LIKE I ASKED YOU TO.

01:54.390 --> 01:55.072

- WELL, YEAH--

01:55.180 --> 01:56.624

01:56.730 --> 01:58.174

01:58.290 --> 01:59.382

01:59.490 --> 02:01.003
SHE'S GONNA BE DANCING AROUND--
- EXCUSE ME.

02:01.120 --> 02:02.838

02:12.580 --> 02:13.979

OF THE ENTIRE BODY.

03:55.750 --> 03:56.956

03:57.060 --> 03:58.368
WHY WOULD I--

03:58.470 --> 03:59.573
- WAIT, SO IS THAT
JUST A PRECAUTIONARY THING?

03:59.680 --> 04:00.294
- WHY WOULD I NEED
A P.E.T. SCAN?

04:00.410 --> 04:01.741
- WELL, A TEST SHOWED

04:01.860 --> 04:03.191
SOME MINOR LIVER BLOOD
ABNORMALITIES.

04:03.310 --> 04:04.538
WE THINK IT'S PROBABLY
FROM THE DRUGS.

04:04.650 --> 04:05.639
BUT JUST TO BE SAFE, IT'S
SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO DO.

04:05.760 --> 04:07.899
- OKAY.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.241

04:14.080 --> 04:15.479
HE'S GONNA FIND ANYTHING.
- RIGHT.

04:15.600 --> 04:16.931
- THIS IS MINOR,
MAYBE FROM THE DRUGS.

04:17.040 --> 04:18.177
- IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT'S
IMPORTANT FOR US TO DO

04:18.290 --> 04:19.382
ONCE YOU'VE FINISHED TREATMENT.

04:19.500 --> 04:21.001
IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE
FOR US TO DEAL WITH,

04:21.120 --> 04:23.259
WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.812
- OKAY.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.844
OKAY.

04:33.480 --> 04:36.574

AH AHH AH

04:47.630 --> 04:51.145
WHEN YOU WERE HURT

05:14.830 --> 05:17.651
CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE MINE

05:21.180 --> 05:22.272
- WHY DO I HAVE TO WEAR
A SUIT?

05:22.390 --> 05:23.960
- BECAUSE IT'S EXCITING.
IT'S A BIG OCCASION.

05:24.080 --> 05:25.627
- YEAH, IT'S FUN TO DRESS UP.

05:25.730 --> 05:27.106

05:28.630 --> 05:30.666
'CAUSE I'M NOT GOING
TO THE CEREMONY.

05:30.770 --> 05:33.113

FOR VICTOR TO BE ADOPTED.

05:37.060 --> 05:38.436

OF THIS FAMILY,

05:40.580 --> 05:42.263
AND SOME STUPID CEREMONY
ISN'T GOING TO CHANGE THAT.

05:42.370 --> 05:43.576
- OKAY, SYD--

05:43.680 --> 05:44.669

WITH A MOUSSELINE OF
SMOKED CHANTERELLE MUSHROOMS

25:56.650 --> 25:59.039
AND BLACK GARLIC.

25:59.140 --> 26:03.031
- OH! MM, MM!

26:03.140 --> 26:04.277
OH, IT IS SO GOOD.

26:04.390 --> 26:06.790
both: MM-MMM!

26:06.910 --> 26:08.969
- OH, THAT'S SO GOOD.

26:09.080 --> 26:12.004
MM. MM.

26:14.640 --> 26:15.356
MM!

26:15.470 --> 26:17.017
NICE PAIRING AS WELL.

26:17.120 --> 26:21.056
- MM.

26:21.160 --> 26:22.297
[clears throat]

26:22.400 --> 26:24.402
- HEY.
- YEAH?

26:24.510 --> 26:25.989
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

26:26.100 --> 26:27.852
DO YOU WANT TO EAT
OUT THERE OR SOMETHING?

26:27.960 --> 26:29.404
- NO, NO, NO.
- YOU DON'T LIKE IT IN HERE?

26:29.510 --> 26:31.683
- I'M JUST, UM--
- YOU HOT?

26:31.790 --> 26:34.304
- NO, I'M JUST WORRIED
ABOUT MY MOTHER.

26:34.420 --> 26:38.481
I'M SORRY.

26:38.590 --> 26:40.649
- LOOK, I THINK HER MOVING
IN WITH SEKOU

26:40.770 --> 26:42.146
WAS KIND OF A GOOD THING,
YOU KNOW?

26:42.250 --> 26:43.353
NOW THAT HE'S HELPING SHOULDER
THE RESPONSIBILITY,

26:43.460 --> 26:45.553
IT'S LIKE IN MY FAMILY.

26:45.670 --> 26:46.739
WHEN ONE OF MY PARENTS
GETS TOO CRAZY,

26:46.840 --> 26:48.114
I JUST SEND 'EM
ON TO THE NEXT SIBLING,

26:48.220 --> 26:51.257
AND I THINK IT'S KEPT ALL OF US
ALIVE, TO BE HONEST.

26:51.360 --> 26:52.156
- [chuckles]
I DON'T KNOW.

26:52.260 --> 26:54.842
I DON'T THINK
IT'S THE SAME THING.

26:54.950 --> 26:56.087
YOU KNOW--
- WHY NOT?

26:56.200 --> 26:57.747
- MY MOM RAISED US
ON HER OWN,

26:57.850 --> 27:00.717
AND SHE WORKED REALLY HARD
TO DO THAT.

27:00.820 --> 27:03.857
AND WITH JABBAR,
FOR FIVE YEARS,

27:03.960 --> 27:05.131
SHE WAS THE OTHER PARENT,
YOU KNOW.

27:05.240 --> 27:07.128
SHE WATCHED HIM
WHEN I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL

27:07.240 --> 27:09.379
AND GOING TO WORK,

27:09.480 --> 27:10.868
AND SHE GOT UP IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT TO FEED HIM.

27:10.970 --> 27:12.892
I'M SORRY. IJUST--

27:13.010 --> 27:15.410
I HATE THAT SHE DOESN'T FEEL
WELCOME IN OUR HOME.

27:15.530 --> 27:18.556
YOU KNOW, IT'S--
IT'S KILLING ME.

27:18.670 --> 27:22.379
AND I'M NOT CHOOSING HER
OVER YOU.

27:22.500 --> 27:25.947
I JUST OWE HER EVERYTHING.

27:26.050 --> 27:30.498
- I GET IT.

27:30.610 --> 27:32.669
- ANYWAYS,
WE'RE GONNA NEED HER HELP

27:32.780 --> 27:36.614
WHEN THE BABY GETS HERE.

27:36.720 --> 27:38.711
- WHEN THE WHO?
WHEN THE WHO GETS HERE?

27:38.820 --> 27:39.991
- WE'RE HAVING A BABY.

27:40.100 --> 27:42.580
- NO!
YOU'RE PREGNANT RIGHT NOW?

27:42.690 --> 27:43.679
- HAPPY ANNIVERSARY.

27:43.800 --> 27:45.279
- NO! ARE YOU KIDDING?

27:45.380 --> 27:46.301
YOU'RE PREGNANT?
- YES.

27:46.420 --> 27:47.409
- YOU HAVE A BABY IN HERE?
- IT'S OUR BABY.

27:47.520 --> 27:49.101
- COME ON!
- [laughing]

27:49.210 --> 27:52.691
- "FITNA."

27:52.800 --> 27:54.381
- [laughs]
"FITNA" IS NOT A WORD.

27:54.500 --> 27:55.762
- MA, "FITNA" IS A WORD.
IT'S LIKE I'M FITNA--

27:55.880 --> 27:57.836
- USE IT IN A SENTENCE.
- I'M FITNA--

27:57.950 --> 27:59.258
- HELLO!
- COLD OUT THERE.

27:59.360 --> 28:00.668
- WHAT'S WRONG?

28:00.780 --> 28:01.804
WHY ARE YOU TWO HERE
ON YOUR ANNIVERSARY?

28:01.920 --> 28:03.364
- WE JUST WANTED
TO COME BY AND SEE

28:03.470 --> 28:05.609
HOW EVERYTHING WAS GOING.

28:05.710 --> 28:07.439
- OH.
WELL, EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

28:07.540 --> 28:08.711
SEKOU LOVES HAVING ME.

28:08.820 --> 28:10.708
- YES, I DO.
- [chuckles]

28:10.820 --> 28:12.196
- IT'S--WHAT?
[slap]

28:12.310 --> 28:13.709
- THAT IS NOT FUNNY.
- THAT'S MY NEXT WORD.

28:13.830 --> 28:14.512
- YOU GUYS
ARE PLAYING SCRABBLE?

28:14.620 --> 28:16.508
- IS THAT FOOD? PLEASE?

28:16.620 --> 28:18.417
- YES, WELL, MY SON LIKES
MAKING UP WORDS.

28:18.520 --> 28:19.794
- MOM, THAT WAS A REAL WORD.

28:19.900 --> 28:21.549
- "FITNA."
- "FITNA" IS A WORD.

28:21.660 --> 28:23.343
- USE IT IN A SENTENCE.
- I'M FITNA EAT.

28:23.460 --> 28:24.939
- "FITNA," NOT A WORD.

28:25.040 --> 28:26.143
- NOT A WORD.
- NOT IN THIS COUNTRY.

28:26.250 --> 28:27.103
- WHY ARE YOU TRYING
TO CHEAT HER, SEKOU?

28:27.220 --> 28:29.211
- OKAY, GUYS.
I'M FINE, REALLY.

28:29.320 --> 28:30.730
YOU CAN GO BACK
TO YOUR CELEBRATION.

28:30.840 --> 28:34.048
- WELL, LOOK,
WE WERE AT DINNER,

28:34.160 --> 28:36.424
AND WE WERE
WITH A NEW FRIEND.

28:36.540 --> 28:38.531
AND, UM,
THAT NEW FRIEND THOUGHT

28:38.640 --> 28:39.299
THAT I OWED YOU
AN APOLOGY,

28:39.400 --> 28:42.289
AND I AGREE.

28:42.410 --> 28:44.128
I'M SORRY THAT I TALKED TO YOU
THE WAY I DID

28:44.230 --> 28:45.197
WHEN WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT JABBAR,

28:45.300 --> 28:46.164
AND I WON'T LET IT
HAPPEN AGAIN.

28:46.270 --> 28:48.500
- IT'S OKAY.

28:48.620 --> 28:50.406
- AND, UM,
SO THEN THIS NEW FRIEND

28:50.520 --> 28:52.579
WANTED TO MEET YOU.

28:52.690 --> 28:54.442
SO NOW WE'VE--
WE'VE BROUGHT HIM OVER.

28:54.560 --> 28:55.629
- MM-HMM.
- I HOPE THAT'S OKAY.

28:55.730 --> 28:57.311
- [laughs]
SURE.

28:57.420 --> 28:59.797
- OKAY, UM,

28:59.910 --> 29:01.241
THEY'RE IN HERE.

29:01.360 --> 29:04.807
AND WE WANTED YOU
TO BE THE FIRST TO KNOW.

29:04.910 --> 29:06.559
- OH, MY GOD.
- I'M PREGNANT.

29:06.670 --> 29:07.944
- OH.

29:08.050 --> 29:09.256
OH!

29:09.360 --> 29:11.157
[laughin
OH! g]

29:11.260 --> 29:14.536
OH!

29:14.640 --> 29:15.641
OH, MY BABY.

29:15.750 --> 29:19.265
[laughter]

29:19.370 --> 29:21.338
- YEAH.

29:21.440 --> 29:23.476
- YOU KNOW, HE'S BANGING
WITH THE HAMMER,

29:23.580 --> 29:25.024
AND HE JUST KEEPS LOOKING
AT ME.

29:25.140 --> 29:26.277
HE'S GETTING AGITATED.
HE'S LIKE...

29:26.380 --> 29:27.688
[German accent]
"THE LEEK 12 A WASSAH."

29:27.800 --> 29:29.370
[laughs]
AND I WAS JUST LIKE,

29:29.490 --> 29:30.798
"OKAY, HERE'S $300."

29:30.900 --> 29:32.128
SO I DON'T KNOW
WHAT WAS WRONG.

29:32.250 --> 29:33.456
- BUT IT'S FIXED.
- THE LICK WAS WASSAH.

29:33.560 --> 29:34.106
- WELL, THAT'S HOW YOU PLAY
THE GAME WITH HIM.

29:34.220 --> 29:35.141
TRUST ME.

29:35.250 --> 29:37.286
- [laughs]

29:37.390 --> 29:40.041
- WELL, I GOT SOMETHING
I WANT TO TELL YOU.

29:40.150 --> 29:41.253
I, UH--

29:41.360 --> 29:43.157

TO ME FROM CHRISTMAS.

29:43.260 --> 29:44.568
'CAUSE YOU FORGOT
TO GIVE ME...

29:44.670 --> 29:45.671
- NO.
- MY CHRISTMAS BONUS.

29:45.780 --> 29:47.088
- NO, IF YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN IT
BY NOW--

29:47.190 --> 29:47.940
- YOU'D LIKE TO PROMOTE ME

29:48.060 --> 29:52.338
TO HEAD TECHNICAL ADVISOR.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.571
- I DON'T LIKE TO ACT...

29:58.690 --> 30:01.545
IM PU LSIVELY.

30:01.660 --> 30:04.345
I LIKE TO...

30:04.450 --> 30:06.338
YOU KNOW, THINK THINGS OUT
AND ALL THAT.

30:06.450 --> 30:08.691
BUT SOMETIMES I JUST WANT
TO TAKE A LEAP OF FAITH

30:08.800 --> 30:11.553
AND DO WHAT I FEEL IS RIGHT.

30:11.670 --> 30:13.945
AND...

30:14.050 --> 30:17.907
THIS FEELS LIKE IT'S SOMETHING
I HAVE TO DO

30:18.020 --> 30:18.463
AND I WANT TO DO.

30:18.570 --> 30:22.017
I, UH,

30:22.130 --> 30:24.269
I'M GONNA MOVE
TO MINNESOTA.

30:27.480 --> 30:29.880
- THAT IS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT
YOU WERE GONNA SAY.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.195
- I'M GONNA GO BACK TOMORROW.
- TOMORROW.

30:32.310 --> 30:34.369
- I'M GONNA FIND
AN APARTMENT.

30:34.480 --> 30:36.892
AND THEN I'M GONNA COME BACK,
TAKE CARE OF THINGS HERE,

30:37.000 --> 30:41.482
AND I'M GONNA CLOSE
THE SHOP.

30:41.590 --> 30:43.387
I'M GONNA MOVE THERE.
I'M GONNA MOVE THERE.

30:43.490 --> 30:47.244
I, UM--

30:47.360 --> 30:48.520
HERE'S THE THING.

30:48.630 --> 30:49.767
I NEVER MET ANYBODY
LIKE YOU.

30:49.880 --> 30:51.802
- UGH.
- NO, THAT'S THE TRUTH.

30:51.910 --> 30:53.912
I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD.

30:54.020 --> 30:57.319
I NEVER WAS LOOKING
TO MEET ANYBODY.

30:57.440 --> 31:00.329
YOU'RE, UH...

31:00.440 --> 31:03.295
VERY SPECIAL.

31:03.410 --> 31:06.402
BUT MY DAUGHTER--

31:06.510 --> 31:09.343
I WAS WATCHING HER,

31:09.450 --> 31:10.678
AND I JUST THOUGHT,

31:10.790 --> 31:11.893
SHE'S GONNA BE IN COLLEGE.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.729
AND--YOU KNOW,
I'M GONNA BLINK...

31:13.830 --> 31:15.240
- I KNOW.

31:15.350 --> 31:16.100
- BELIEVE ME.

31:16.210 --> 31:17.211

31:17.320 --> 31:18.799
IF I'M LIKE
AN ABSENTEE DAD--

31:18.910 --> 31:21.140
- NO, YOU COULD NEVER
DO THAT.

31:21.250 --> 31:22.353
- YEAH, I DON'T WANT
TO DO THAT.

31:22.460 --> 31:23.449
- I KNOW.

31:23.570 --> 31:26.084
[sighs]

31:26.190 --> 31:29.774
- WISH THERE WAS ANOTHER WAY.

31:29.880 --> 31:30.801
- [sighs]

31:30.920 --> 31:33.059
IT'S OKAY.
[chuckles]

32:20.280 --> 32:22.100
- THIS ONE COMES
WITH HOT COCOA TODAY.

I CAN GIVE YOU DATING ADVICE.

35:06.580 --> 35:08.571

35:08.690 --> 35:09.918

36:42.020 --> 36:43.055

36:43.160 --> 36:44.263
- BEAUTIFUL FAMILY YOU HAVE.

36:44.370 --> 36:46.053
- THEY'RE SOMETHING,
AREN'T THEY?

36:46.160 --> 36:48.299

36:55.930 --> 36:58.137

HEADED TO THE AIRPORT.

37:00.320 --> 37:01.696

37:01.800 --> 37:04.416
- AND I WANTED TO--

37:04.530 --> 37:06.418
CAN YOU GIVE THIS
TO YOUR NEPHEW,

37:06.530 --> 37:08.384
THE--THE KID WHO DOESN'T LOOK
AT ANYBODY?

37:08.500 --> 37:09.353
- MAX?

37:09.460 --> 37:12.634
YOU LOOK DOWN

37:12.740 --> 37:15.538
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK
AT PEOPLE.

37:15.640 --> 37:17.323
BUT YOU STILL SEE PEOPLE.

37:17.440 --> 37:18.395
SOMEBODY GAVE IT TO ME
WHEN I WAS HIS AGE,

37:18.510 --> 37:21.911
AND I STARTED
TAKING PICTURES, AND--

37:22.030 --> 37:23.122
I DON'T KNOW.
GIVE IT TO HIM.

37:23.240 --> 37:25.617
IF HE DOESN'T LIKE IT,
SELL IT ON eBAY.

37:25.720 --> 37:27.199
HAVE A RAFFLE OR SOMETHING.

37:27.310 --> 37:29.346
- THANK YOU.
- YEAH.

37:29.450 --> 37:31.543
OKAY, SO THE OTHER THING
I WANTED TO SAY WAS THAT, UM,

37:31.660 --> 37:32.684
I THINK I MIGHT LOVE YOU.

37:32.800 --> 37:36.179
YEAH.

37:36.280 --> 37:37.599
THINK I MIGHT LOVE YOU,

37:37.700 --> 37:38.667
AND I KNOW THAT
MIGHT SOUND CRAZY,

37:38.770 --> 37:40.761
AND MAYBE YOU DON'T SHARE
THE FEELING,

37:40.870 --> 37:42.940
BUT THAT'S OKAY.

37:43.050 --> 37:45.974
- I LOVE YOU TOO.

37:51.130 --> 37:52.700
- COME WITH ME.

37:52.820 --> 37:53.844
- OKAY, LET'S GO.

37:53.960 --> 37:55.336
[chuckles]

37:55.440 --> 37:59.058
- NO, I MEAN,
WHY NOT, RIGHT?

37:59.170 --> 38:03.345
I DON'T, UH--

38:03.450 --> 38:07.068
THERE'S ONLY TWO PEOPLE
THAT I CARE ABOUT.

38:07.180 --> 38:10.866
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE ONE OF THEM.

38:13.180 --> 38:15.523
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

38:15.630 --> 38:17.109
JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

38:17.220 --> 38:19.324
- YEAH.

38:27.300 --> 38:29.530
- [exhales]

38:29.650 --> 38:32.642
- [sighs]
[engine turns over]

38:46.460 --> 38:50.009
- IT'S GONNA BE GOOD NEWS.

38:50.120 --> 38:52.008
HEY.

38:52.120 --> 38:56.534
- LET ME CUT TO THE CHASE.

38:56.640 --> 38:57.732
YOU'RE CANCER-FREE, KRISTINA.

38:57.850 --> 38:59.875
- OH.

38:59.990 --> 39:01.082
- [laughs breathily]

39:01.200 --> 39:04.363
- [laughing]

39:04.480 --> 39:06.641
- SORRY, BUT CAN YOU SAY
THAT AGAIN?

39:06.750 --> 39:08.263
- THE P.E.T. SCAN SHOWED
NO IRREGULARITIES.

39:08.380 --> 39:10.371
THIS CONFIRMS
MY IMPRESSION

39:10.480 --> 39:12.926
THAT THE BLOOD TEST
ABNORMALITY

39:13.040 --> 39:14.371
WAS A CONSEQUENCE
OF ONE OF THE MEDS YOU GOT.

39:14.490 --> 39:15.514
YOU ARE CANCER-FREE.

39:15.620 --> 39:16.587
- [laughing]
- THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

39:16.690 --> 39:17.759
- OH, MY GOD.
- THANK YOU.

39:17.870 --> 39:19.792
- NOW, OF COURSE,
YOU STILL NEED TO HAVE

39:19.900 --> 39:21.549
YOUR RADIATION THERAPY.
- YEAH.

39:21.660 --> 39:22.900
- WE CAN SCHEDULE YOU FOR THAT
IN FOUR TO SIX WEEKS.

39:23.010 --> 39:25.285
AND THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT WE NEED TO TRACK CLOSELY.

39:25.390 --> 39:27.529
YOU NEED TO COME
TO REGULAR EXAMS.

39:27.640 --> 39:29.665
YOUR NEXT MAMMOGRAM
WILL BE IN THREE MONTHS.

39:29.780 --> 39:31.463
WE DON'T USE THE WORD "CURE"
FOR FIVE YEARS.

39:31.570 --> 39:35.290
- I UNDERSTAND.
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

39:35.400 --> 39:37.709
- BUT FOR NOW,
TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

39:37.820 --> 39:39.367
RELAX.

39:39.480 --> 39:42.404
ENJOY YOURSELF.
ENJOY YOUR FAMILY.

39:42.510 --> 39:43.545
YOU DESERVE IT.

39:43.650 --> 39:44.924
- THANK YOU SO MUCH, DOCTOR.

39:45.030 --> 39:46.611
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

39:46.720 --> 39:49.371
- THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

39:55.080 --> 39:58.800
THANK YOU.

39:58.910 --> 40:06.396
- LONELY CLIFFS
AND WATERFALLS

40:06.500 --> 40:15.295
IF NO ONE SEES ME,
I'M NOT HERE AT ALL

40:15.410 --> 40:20.438
YOU COULD BE THE ONE
TO LIBERATE ME

40:20.550 --> 40:22.029

41:05.530 --> 41:09.387
SUDDENLY

LEFT TO DO

41:21.680 --> 41:26.196
AND SO I THANK YOU DEARLY

41:26.310 --> 41:29.518
