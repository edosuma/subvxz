Previously on One Tree Hill.

00:02.642 --> 00:03.814
What’re you talking about Haley?

00:04.289 --> 00:05.780
We got married last night.

00:06.789 --> 00:09.338
Mom… I want to leave Tree Hill.

00:09.558 --> 00:10.576
This is from Lucas.

00:10.623 --> 00:12.221
I’m sorry; I shouldn’t have hid it from you.

00:12.287 --> 00:14.134
You’ve had the words the whole time and didn’t tell me?

00:14.201 --> 00:15.041
I was going to.

00:15.165 --> 00:17.110
- When?! After you read it first?!
- No!

00:17.243 --> 00:19.884
It’s Dan. He had a heart attack.

00:20.238 --> 00:24.196
Your father is unconscious Nathan and now you’re telling me you got married?

00:24.273 --> 00:27.734
- Mrs Scott, we’ve...
- Shut up, Haley. Shut your selfish little mouth!

T.H. White said;

01:33.750 --> 01:36.717
perhaps we all give the best of our hearts uncritically…

01:38.642 --> 01:41.181
to those who hardly think about us in return.

01:46.558 --> 01:49.686
The Phoenix Effect isn’t uncommon in cardiac patients.

01:49.743 --> 01:54.186
They grow… remorseful… introspective, sometimes even joyous.

01:54.478 --> 01:56.823
Really? Is it… permanent?

01:57.389 --> 02:02.368
Time will tell. The important thing is to keep him calm. Don’t upset him.

02:15.857 --> 02:17.544
Three questions. You ready?

02:18.199 --> 02:19.015
Was that your first one?

02:19.848 --> 02:22.843
Number one; what happened to your hair?

02:26.738 --> 02:28.274
I left it in Charleston.

02:29.662 --> 02:30.713
You and Haley still married?

02:30.845 --> 02:32.556
Yeah, she hasn’t thrown me out yet.

02:33.861 --> 02:34.604
Number two;

02:36.114 --> 02:37.174
why’d you come back?

02:37.794 --> 02:38.803
It was the right thing to do.

02:40.454 --> 02:43.118
Which actually brings me to my number two; how’s your…

02:45.156 --> 02:46.029
how’s Dan doing?

02:46.569 --> 02:51.965
Oh, he’s alright. He’s still alive, probably freaking out about me and Haley; like my mom.

02:53.104 --> 02:54.551
Alright, last question;

02:54.900 --> 02:57.720
you regret all that ‘you’re my brother’ stuff, now that you’re back?

02:58.238 --> 03:00.440
- Absolutely. You?
- Definitely.

03:03.313 --> 03:05.473
So I can totally see your family tripping out.

03:06.082 --> 03:08.689
I mean I freaked out and I’m not even related to Haley.

03:09.165 --> 03:11.540
Actually, you are now.

03:16.132 --> 03:17.361
She’s gotta be pregnant.

03:18.191 --> 03:19.425
Or in love.

03:19.778 --> 03:23.884
I’m going with pregnant. Please, he’s a Scott boy, just look at one and snap your…

03:25.584 --> 03:27.079
never mind, um…

03:28.252 --> 03:29.950
what’s new in your musical world right now?

03:30.956 --> 03:31.820
I dunno.

03:32.430 --> 03:37.248
The new Keane’s pretty good or Modest Mouse, Pilot to Gunners.

03:37.372 --> 03:38.309
Keane…

03:39.224 --> 03:42.388
- Mighty Mouse…
- It’s Modest. Why are you typing those?

03:42.592 --> 03:47.088
I’m putting them on your turn-ons. I’m adding you to Lust Factor dot com.

03:47.175 --> 03:47.754
Brooke!

03:48.089 --> 03:51.696
Oops! Too late. We can check your scores in a couple of hours.

03:51.758 --> 03:54.180
I told you; I am not about chasing guys right now.

03:54.385 --> 03:56.228
Doesn’t mean I can’t chase them for you

03:56.360 --> 03:58.501
and missy, if you’re not about chasing guys…

03:58.680 --> 04:02.797
why are there half a dozen e-mails to Jake Jagielski in your sent mail folder?

04:02.960 --> 04:06.550
He hasn’t answered any of them and I swear I am changing all of my passwords.

04:09.001 --> 04:13.278
Okay, I don’t know, alright? But ever since he-who-can’t-be-named,

04:13.375 --> 04:16.288
I just feel like I need to shake things up and not guys,

04:16.375 --> 04:19.113
okay, like… life, important stuff.

04:19.305 --> 04:20.993
Guys are important.

04:21.699 --> 04:25.285
And speaking of the nameless one; he’s waiting so we should get going.

04:25.935 --> 04:27.327
What do you think he wants?

04:28.054 --> 04:30.563
If he’s smart… forgiveness.

04:38.424 --> 04:39.477
What do you think?

04:39.800 --> 04:44.777
I was thinking; bar right over there, then some lights…

04:45.713 --> 04:47.674
DJ, right over here…

04:50.337 --> 04:53.742
and then... the three of us trying to be friends…

04:54.334 --> 04:56.373
right about... well, there.

04:56.697 --> 05:00.091
Okay, totally confused over… here.

05:00.372 --> 05:03.342
I wanna throw a party for Nathan and Haley, okay?

05:03.930 --> 05:06.900
You know, everyone’s been so… weirded out about them getting married

05:06.972 --> 05:11.989
and nobody’s stepping up and just saying ‘hey, it’s cool! Let’s celebrate.’

05:12.721 --> 05:15.517
We’re their friends… we should do this for them.

05:16.178 --> 05:20.535
And since nobody plans a party better than you and nobody rocks a party better than you…

05:23.039 --> 05:25.029
I was hoping the three of us could work it out.

05:25.102 --> 05:26.710
The party part or the friends part?

05:26.939 --> 05:27.697
All of it.

05:30.853 --> 05:32.254
Look, I guess you found the letter.

05:36.229 --> 05:37.625
I should get something to drink.

05:38.757 --> 05:40.405
Look! I meant what I said.

05:41.645 --> 05:45.218
Okay, and now that I’m back, it’s a little embarrassing

05:46.529 --> 05:48.274
- so how about we just...
- Don’t mention it!

05:48.612 --> 05:49.330
Great.

05:51.260 --> 05:54.009
So what do you say huh? You in?

05:54.122 --> 05:57.245
- Any excuse for a party.
- For Nathan and Haley, why not.

05:57.322 --> 05:59.663
Great! We’ll do it together.

06:00.368 --> 06:02.181
Come on! Check it out!

06:03.769 --> 06:06.623
Fake cough? That’s the best you could come up with?

06:06.678 --> 06:07.690
I know, I had nothing.

06:12.811 --> 06:14.827
Have you ever seen the sky so blue?

06:16.538 --> 06:19.400
- It’s a nice day.
- They’re all nice.

06:21.924 --> 06:23.034
Dan,

06:25.784 --> 06:28.806
- we should talk about Keith.
- I don’t blame you, Deb.

06:30.751 --> 06:33.250
Lord knows I’ve given you enough reasons to stray.

06:37.005 --> 06:38.933
 I think I’ll get some rest now.

06:40.069 --> 06:43.075
- Okay.
- How about you bring the divorce papers by?

06:43.151 --> 06:46.296
I should sign them. You never know what could happen to me.

06:46.449 --> 06:48.554
Nothing is going to happen to you, Dan.

06:50.141 --> 06:51.445
It already has.

07:03.498 --> 07:05.167
Excellent right back at you BIL.

07:06.541 --> 07:09.806
Okay, I’ve been gone for, what; few days and you already forgotten my name?

07:09.929 --> 07:13.458
- Who’s Bill?
- B-I-L; Brother In Law. That’s you!

07:14.016 --> 07:16.151
Oh-ho, crap. I’m related to you?

07:17.591 --> 07:21.368
Look, I know… I was sketchy when I left but…

07:21.896 --> 07:24.572
just, you know, you surprised me and…

07:25.510 --> 07:27.435
I just want you to know I’m happy for you, Hales.

07:28.177 --> 07:32.960
I know. And Nathan told me about you calling and asking about Dan and us and…

07:33.437 --> 07:34.475
it’s cool. Thank you.

07:36.646 --> 07:39.272
Hey! Get your own wife.

07:39.979 --> 07:42.222
Okay, that just sounds weird.

07:45.219 --> 07:48.627
Oh, crap. Can you grab that for me real quick?

07:54.321 --> 07:55.181
Thanks.

07:56.736 --> 08:02.492
Oh look, it’s our very own Britney Spears and… whoever she married this week.

08:02.696 --> 08:05.942
I have a question for you guys; what do you think? Pink booties or blue?

08:06.057 --> 08:08.129
Booties? Brooke, I’m not pregnant.

08:08.218 --> 08:11.315
No. The only way this isn’t totally screwed up is if you’re knocked up

08:11.387 --> 08:12.819
but don’t worry, your secret’s safe with me.

08:13.669 --> 08:17.084
What’s this lame-ass joke about you guys getting married?

08:17.171 --> 08:19.513
He’s in shock now that you’re officially off the market.

08:19.659 --> 08:22.031
- It’s true Tim, Haley’s preggers.
- Brooke!

08:22.133 --> 08:24.395
Right; and Lucas moved away.

08:25.486 --> 08:28.123
You guys gotta do better if you gonna get one over on the Tim.

08:29.685 --> 08:30.591
The Tim

08:44.203 --> 08:45.080
Hi.

08:48.011 --> 08:50.094
This is for Mr Scott; Dan.

08:51.033 --> 08:52.028
I don’t know what to call him.

08:52.435 --> 08:53.847
You can take it to him yourself.

08:54.399 --> 08:56.446
Nathan said that probably wasn’t a good idea.

08:56.560 --> 08:58.028
And coming over here was?

09:01.550 --> 09:04.097
Mrs Scott, I’m not sorry I married Nathan

09:04.158 --> 09:06.800
but I am sorry about how we ambushed you with it.

09:07.096 --> 09:09.129
I know you’re dealing with a lot right now.

09:12.135 --> 09:15.310
Anyway, Lucas is throwing us a party and we’d…

09:17.081 --> 09:19.703
I’d love it if you could come.

09:20.768 --> 09:24.310
Nathan’s father nearly dies and you want to have a party?

09:24.704 --> 09:26.999
And even if Dan were fine,

09:27.356 --> 09:31.626
I would not and will not give you my blessing for destroying my sons life

09:32.063 --> 09:37.213
or, and you can trust me on this, your own.

09:50.232 --> 09:50.935
Hey hoe.

09:51.841 --> 09:53.458
Brooke, step away from the computer.

09:53.582 --> 09:57.800
Soon as I check your ‘Lust Factor’ score, this morning you were up to a 7.6.

09:57.888 --> 09:58.819
Out of a 10?

10:00.773 --> 10:03.678
Brooke you did not post my ass on the internet!

10:03.775 --> 10:07.345
Of course I did! And well, well, well, it raised Miss P’s overall

10:07.437 --> 10:11.814
by five tenths on a point and you now have fifty-three guys waiting to meet you.

10:11.901 --> 10:13.059
I can’t believe this.

10:13.811 --> 10:16.617
Too old. Oh, too hairy.

10:17.240 --> 10:19.520
Too… mine!

10:20.405 --> 10:23.381
Oh too female, but a 9.8, that’s interesting.

10:25.311 --> 10:29.592
Here we go; here’s an emo looking, sappy, guitar playing loser.

10:29.664 --> 10:31.794
- He’s perfect for you.
- Not interested

10:32.028 --> 10:35.388
and I’ve gotta burn Nathan and Haley’s CD so get up. Move it!

10:35.600 --> 10:36.252
Fine!

10:42.156 --> 10:47.630
So, what do you think our... new pal Lucas wrote in that letter anyway?

10:47.871 --> 10:51.311
Didn’t matter when he was gone, why should it matter now?

11:02.026 --> 11:05.525
You can shave your head dawg, but you still aint as pretty as me.

11:06.185 --> 11:07.331
How you doing Skills?

11:08.104 --> 11:09.637
Question is how you doing man.

11:10.424 --> 11:11.976
I’m good! I’m good.

11:12.180 --> 11:13.818
Alright, here it is.

11:15.560 --> 11:18.268
How bout you tell me da truth in da next five seconds

11:18.571 --> 11:20.142
and I forget you jus lied to me.

11:24.086 --> 11:26.521
I woke up in Charleston and realised...

11:27.873 --> 11:33.362
nobody knows me here, nobody knows about Dan, my mom,

11:34.474 --> 11:38.498
all the things I regret. It’s all been erased. You know, it’s gone.

11:41.903 --> 11:42.858
And it felt good.

11:43.746 --> 11:46.956
Knowing that whoever I decided to be from that day forward

11:47.299 --> 11:48.852
was the person that they’d see.

11:51.221 --> 11:52.327
Then the phone rang.

11:52.703 --> 11:56.244
Well hey, what could I do to make it easier for you?

11:56.669 --> 11:57.980
My bald head brother.

12:00.760 --> 12:01.645
Actually,

12:02.997 --> 12:04.936
see if you can get the guys to help me out a little later.

12:05.165 --> 12:06.950
Okay, time and place.

12:07.194 --> 12:09.014
Beautiful, thanks Skills.

12:09.597 --> 12:10.276
No doubt.

12:12.288 --> 12:17.609
Hey yo Luke! You gotta let it flow baby. You know, like me.

12:17.707 --> 12:18.890
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

12:19.577 --> 12:21.373
As you can see, I’m trying.

12:22.996 --> 12:24.603
Alright. No doubt.

12:27.962 --> 12:30.420
Hey, Nathan. It’s good to see you.

12:31.665 --> 12:33.799
- Haley told me what you said to her.
- Nate!

12:33.871 --> 12:37.456
We’re married now mom, and you and dad can flip out all you want but it’s done!

12:37.527 --> 12:38.872
Nobody cares what you think!

12:40.394 --> 12:42.149
I only want what’s best for you, Nathan.

12:42.934 --> 12:46.789
Then how about you and dad back off… and shut up about Haley and me.

12:46.866 --> 12:48.258
Your father doesn’t even know!

12:48.792 --> 12:50.389
- You haven’t told him?
- No.

12:50.517 --> 12:52.154
You’re such an adult, why don’t you tell him?

12:53.339 --> 12:56.333
The news will probably kill him and believe me,

12:56.394 --> 12:59.492
the guilt from that will stay with you a lot longer than Haley ever will.

13:02.328 --> 13:03.870
Thanks for the love mom.

13:12.102 --> 13:16.701
All these empty bedrooms. We could open a crack house; an upscale one.

13:17.043 --> 13:18.273
Yeah, like a crack resort.

13:19.188 --> 13:21.683
She came back for Mr Waffles.

13:24.052 --> 13:25.870
- Nathan do something?
- No.

13:26.746 --> 13:31.175
- His… mother, she said...
- You were ruining her son’s life.

13:31.288 --> 13:32.526
Yeah, basically.

13:34.642 --> 13:36.213
Of course she did.

13:38.312 --> 13:42.721
In-laws… are like the FBI, honey.

13:43.688 --> 13:49.786
They have a system and they follow it. First manoeuvre is you’re ruining her child’s life.

13:49.858 --> 13:52.633
- Yeah, then it goes to; she can’t cook.
- Her house is dirty.

13:52.706 --> 13:54.317
We found some hash in the guestroom.

13:56.709 --> 13:58.618
There’s only one way to deal with them kiddo.

13:58.705 --> 14:02.387
Screw em. I mean, you know, don’t actually have sex with them.

14:02.499 --> 14:03.309
Dad!

14:04.403 --> 14:07.993
What your father’s saying is, if you’re gonna come home crying

14:08.064 --> 14:10.143
every time you let them get the best of you;

14:11.029 --> 14:14.782
you might as well move back in now, before we give your stuff to charity.

14:16.058 --> 14:20.180
You wanted this Haley. Time to grow up.

14:21.945 --> 14:25.273
By the way, the dog threw up on Mr Waffles.

14:52.010 --> 14:53.245
- Keith.
- Hey.

14:54.299 --> 14:58.314
I meant to call you but… you know, this thing with Dan is…

15:03.419 --> 15:06.572
Anyway... Luke left his IPod in the truck.

15:08.789 --> 15:10.084
Oh, I’m sorry.

15:11.052 --> 15:12.690
In that you had to come back.

15:14.059 --> 15:17.948
But I’ll be honest, I’m relieved that Lucas is home.

15:18.455 --> 15:19.157
Yeah.

15:19.854 --> 15:20.975
And you too.

15:21.195 --> 15:23.529
Well I’m not sure how long I’m gonna stay but...

15:24.753 --> 15:25.813
you know, we’ll see.

15:27.405 --> 15:28.239
I’ll see ya.

15:43.316 --> 15:46.564
- That kid looks kinda like Luke. 
- It can’t be, Luke moved away.

15:46.662 --> 15:48.700
Ah, hey thanks for helping out guys.

15:49.356 --> 15:53.486
So you throwin a party for da devil huh? This part of your fresh start?

15:53.709 --> 15:55.580
You know what, you’re going to be surprised Skills.

15:56.733 --> 16:00.005
- Haley’s turned him into a pretty decent guy.
- Hey if you say so man.

16:00.163 --> 16:03.357
Hey dawg, with dis new look of yours, really don’t impress me.

16:03.451 --> 16:06.902
Now if you get a afro like Fergie, den we can talk.

16:15.440 --> 16:19.098
- Woah, Peyton. That looks great.
- Thanks.

16:19.189 --> 16:23.798
Okay, for future reference; having a convertible filled with inflated rubber, not smart!

16:23.889 --> 16:25.369
- Helium condoms?
- What?

16:25.452 --> 16:28.554
If she’s pregnant, it’s a reminder and if she’s not; it’s a reminder it’s cute.

16:29.046 --> 16:31.474
- Hey Mouth, how’s your bod?
- Skinny.

16:33.290 --> 16:34.750
You know Skills and Fergie, right?

16:34.873 --> 16:37.944
Of course I do. Hey guys, do you know Peyton?

16:38.830 --> 16:39.362
Hi.

16:40.008 --> 16:41.103
What’s up skinny girl?

16:41.969 --> 16:44.344
Peyton’s an 8.1 on the ‘Lust Factor’.

16:45.937 --> 16:46.966
Soon to be a 9.

16:47.678 --> 16:50.135
Now I was thinking we can take the cameras, put them out on the tables,

16:50.222 --> 16:51.999
people can take pictures for the wedding wall.

16:52.220 --> 16:52.982
Nice.

16:54.267 --> 16:57.043
Care to know what else I have planned? I know you do!

16:57.641 --> 17:02.147
I have spray string; for when Tutor Girl and Boy arrive and…

17:02.613 --> 17:03.575
Mouth, come here.

17:06.002 --> 17:06.688
Sit.

17:08.076 --> 17:09.592
What is that?

17:09.757 --> 17:13.830
This, Missy blond girl, is the Brooke Davis version of  ‘Spin the Bottle’.

17:14.968 --> 17:18.250
Only now, it’s ‘Spin the Body’. Watch.

17:20.365 --> 17:22.250
Okay, you two have to make out.

17:24.609 --> 17:27.291
And last but not least; we have ‘Five Minutes in the Elevator’.

17:27.434 --> 17:30.246
- Isn’t it ‘Five Minutes in the Closet’?
- Yeah, if you’re in junior high.

17:30.318 --> 17:33.651
But the great part about this is; you know how everybody has their elevator list?

17:33.800 --> 17:34.434
What?

17:36.841 --> 17:38.914
Your elevator list! Come on!

17:39.005 --> 17:42.540
The list of people you’re allowed to have sex with if you’re ever stuck in an elevator with them.

17:42.741 --> 17:44.439
- Halle Berry.
- Beyonce.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.487
- Jack Black.
- Brooke Davis.

17:48.126 --> 17:52.400
Well! Everybody makes a list and if two people have each others names…

17:52.585 --> 17:54.034
five minutes in the elevator.

17:55.667 --> 17:57.371
Sounds like fun Brooke. Nice work!

17:57.470 --> 18:00.885
Thank you. Now all we need is a Nathan and a Haley.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.771
No. Yes. No. Yes.

18:08.800 --> 18:09.716
How you doing dad?

18:14.878 --> 18:17.509
I’m sorry about the play-offs Nathan. All on me.

18:17.612 --> 18:19.255
It’s okay, it’s done.

18:21.200 --> 18:24.720
- I know things haven’t been great between us lately...
- Dad, listen, before you say anything...

18:25.329 --> 18:27.069
there’s something you should know.

18:28.820 --> 18:29.982
Haley and I…

18:31.094 --> 18:32.138
we got married.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.998
Uh, you trying to give me another heart attack, son?

18:36.167 --> 18:37.284
No, it’s true.

18:38.614 --> 18:41.712
Sorry we didn’t tell you but... well there it is.

18:41.805 --> 18:43.238
So that’s it for basketball.

18:45.983 --> 18:47.892
- Why should it be?
- You’ll see.

18:48.767 --> 18:51.415
You think you can do it all now but, one day you’ll look up

18:51.486 --> 18:53.699
and realise all you have to live with are your mistakes.

18:54.190 --> 18:57.538
It’s not a mistake dad. We’re both happy. It’s a good thing.

18:57.610 --> 18:59.708
I was talking about my mistakes too Nathan.

18:59.807 --> 19:01.548
Sooner or later we all choose a path.

19:02.125 --> 19:05.347
Sometimes you never look back and sometimes life forces you to.

19:06.711 --> 19:07.609
Okay…

19:10.654 --> 19:12.939
I’m just gonna let you get some rest, alright dad?

19:15.167 --> 19:15.868
Nathan.

19:19.273 --> 19:20.899
Would you ask Lucas to drop by?

19:21.987 --> 19:23.631
I’d really like to see your brother.

19:43.005 --> 19:44.812
Hey! This is great, man.

19:46.011 --> 19:47.552
Hey, shouldn’t you be home getting ready?

19:47.680 --> 19:50.746
- Yeah but I… I needed to talk to you first.
- Yeah?

19:50.946 --> 19:53.133
I just went down to the hospital and…

19:55.271 --> 19:56.593
he said he wants to see you.

20:03.551 --> 20:08.235
Luke, when I was younger, I thought I had the best of things;

20:08.334 --> 20:09.812
I had a father in my life

20:11.550 --> 20:16.526
but if you want my advice; just stay away, okay?

20:16.935 --> 20:19.188
The best thing I ever did was get emancipated.

20:21.251 --> 20:22.613
It feels good to be free.

20:23.951 --> 20:24.686
Lucas?

20:26.085 --> 20:27.663
- Oh hey, Nathan.
- Hey.

20:28.480 --> 20:30.919
I guess a congratulations are in order.

20:33.119 --> 20:36.371
Well anyway, I was just heading out so… see ya tonight.

20:40.005 --> 20:41.480
It’s a brave new world, huh?

20:43.877 --> 20:45.469
Hm, this is interesting.

20:45.786 --> 20:48.701
Oh yeah. From the mind of Brooke Davis.

20:50.140 --> 20:52.597
For a twenty dollar donation, you get a fake ID…

20:53.157 --> 20:55.781
and… Nathan and Haley get the cash.

20:57.818 --> 20:58.454
Go on!

21:04.731 --> 21:05.771
Make me younger.

21:06.606 --> 21:08.985
Ready? One, two, three; smile!

21:15.499 --> 21:19.056
So I found a course catalogue in the recycling bin.

21:19.364 --> 21:20.624
Were you thinking about college?

21:20.813 --> 21:23.982
A couple of classes. And now, not so much.

21:24.049 --> 21:28.181
- Why not? Coz I’m back?
- No, it’s just. It can wait.

21:28.237 --> 21:28.943
For what?

21:36.844 --> 21:40.479
So... Nathan told me Dan wants to see me.

21:40.981 --> 21:43.306
Way to bury the lead. Why didn’t you tell me?

21:43.383 --> 21:44.217
I just did.

21:44.586 --> 21:45.343
You gonna go?

21:46.203 --> 21:48.261
I dunno. What do you think?

21:49.393 --> 21:52.229
I think it’s a tough call where Dan’s concerned.

21:54.918 --> 21:57.550
Let me tell you a little dirty secret about being a parent;

21:57.682 --> 21:59.905
I don’t have a road map anymore than you do.

22:00.313 --> 22:04.087
This time the only advice that I can give you is whatever you decide with Dan…

22:04.748 --> 22:05.659
be careful.

22:11.297 --> 22:13.733
Hm… here you go mom.

22:14.660 --> 22:15.828
You’re a kid again.

22:18.033 --> 22:21.450
You know, on second thought, no thanks.

22:29.735 --> 22:32.044
- Hey old man, there you are.
- Keith!

22:32.202 --> 22:33.651
Bought you a decent cup of coffee.

22:34.031 --> 22:34.696
Thanks.

22:34.900 --> 22:37.854
Yeah, of course it’s cold because I stopped by the hospital first,

22:37.932 --> 22:39.288
nurse told me you checked out.

22:39.493 --> 22:41.828
That’s a pretty big risk to be taking with your eyesight.

22:43.089 --> 22:46.305
Who are you to be lecturing me about risk?

22:47.138 --> 22:49.243
Oh, here it comes; the old Whitey dodge.

22:50.020 --> 22:52.892
Hey, we’re talking about you.

22:53.973 --> 22:55.770
You said you went to the hospital.

22:57.092 --> 23:01.925
How much can I bet that you didn’t bother to go see your brother while you were there?

23:02.002 --> 23:04.541
- That is not the point.
- That’s exactly the point.

23:05.483 --> 23:11.218
Look Keith, we both know that Dan is a world class jerk but he’s still your brother.

23:12.446 --> 23:16.041
When you get to be my age, and you’re facing something like this…

23:16.988 --> 23:24.642
damn surgery, then the most important thing in your life becomes your life.

23:26.157 --> 23:28.789
And the person you were when you lived it.

23:29.070 --> 23:32.403
Um, I’m pretty sure that Dan doesn’t wanna see me.

23:32.491 --> 23:36.443
So what?! You be the better man, Keith.

23:39.797 --> 23:41.604
Alright, what happened this time?

23:42.444 --> 23:43.254
I kind of...

23:45.655 --> 23:46.956
slept with Deb.

23:51.542 --> 23:53.632
Oh, forget everything I said.

23:56.635 --> 23:58.123
Hey Brooke, what are you wearing tonight?

23:58.209 --> 24:00.436
I mean it’s more of a party than a wedding reception right?

24:01.660 --> 24:02.341
Brooke!

24:04.211 --> 24:06.622
Nice! We are gonna get you a ten yet.

24:07.308 --> 24:09.705
Hey, is Peyton around? She said she was gonna loan me something to wear.

24:09.791 --> 24:10.809
Yeah, she’ll be out in a second.

24:14.110 --> 24:17.982
- Oh my god! Where did you get that picture of her?
- You gotta love modern technology.

24:18.044 --> 24:20.819
It’s for a little project that I’m doing, to help expand her horizons.

24:21.019 --> 24:23.312
By posting nude pictures of her on the internet?

24:23.481 --> 24:26.733
Don’t worry. She’s gonna thank me when she sees the guys that are lining up.

24:28.045 --> 24:30.702
Oh, he’s cute. Oh, really cute.

24:31.126 --> 24:33.303
- Oh that’s what I’m talking about.
- Down girl.

24:33.558 --> 24:36.513
You can look at the menu all you want but from now on, you eat at home.

24:52.992 --> 24:56.610
- Great party dawg.
- Hey. Thanks Fergie, enjoy.

25:13.675 --> 25:15.154
- Hi.
- Hey.

25:15.800 --> 25:19.804
Kind of ironic, it says; ‘Naley Forever’ but it’s a temporary tattoo.

25:21.637 --> 25:22.568
It’s symbolic.

25:27.612 --> 25:29.009
They’re here! They’re here!

25:29.425 --> 25:32.168
- Mouth, did you get the extra spray string? 
- Sorta.

25:51.619 --> 25:54.860
They were outta spray string so… I got cheese instead.

26:32.626 --> 26:33.291
Lucas.

26:33.911 --> 26:35.708
- Oh hey, Mrs Scott.
- Hi.

26:35.851 --> 26:38.007
- Nice to see you.
- I brought a gift.

26:38.227 --> 26:40.337
Oh, great, ah just set it on the table.

26:40.930 --> 26:41.820
Okay, thanks.

26:47.261 --> 26:48.488
Are you with Nathan or Haley?

26:49.473 --> 26:50.266
Peyton.

26:58.574 --> 27:01.784
- Shot in the dark; ‘Lust Factor’?
- Definitely.

27:02.346 --> 27:07.074
Okay… my friend put me on there as a joke. I’m not looking.

27:07.150 --> 27:08.558
I’m up to a 9.6.	

27:09.654 --> 27:11.266
I’m not on the market.

27:11.385 --> 27:14.138
Well I’m on your page so I'm me sometime.

27:15.968 --> 27:20.732
Are you crazy? What were you thinking, letting him go? He’s gotta be like a 9.5...

27:20.787 --> 27:24.420
6. And remind me to kill you later. How many more are coming?

27:29.865 --> 27:31.726
I thi... I need something to drink.

27:31.799 --> 27:34.620
Brooke! Do not fake cough me!

27:36.493 --> 27:38.219
- Deb, you came.
- Yeah.

27:38.383 --> 27:42.483
I’m not sure why, this is... it’s pretty wild.

27:42.858 --> 27:44.373
Hm, looks fine.

27:46.124 --> 27:47.178
You wanna dance?

27:53.231 --> 27:56.093
No... I think I’ll leave the dancing to the kids.

28:00.891 --> 28:04.319
- Uh, you know, let’s sit.
- Yeah okay.

28:04.424 --> 28:05.160
You're hungry?

28:07.264 --> 28:09.814
How can you be so at ease with all of this?

28:11.437 --> 28:13.086
I know this is hard for you, Deb.

28:13.168 --> 28:15.585
Oh don’t tell me you honestly think this can work?

28:16.865 --> 28:19.271
Haley’s been like a daughter to me.

28:19.394 --> 28:21.422
And Nathan used to be a son to me.

28:22.329 --> 28:25.287
On top of that, you can’t possibly know what they’re up against Karen.

28:25.355 --> 28:27.377
You didn’t get married when you were their age.

28:29.788 --> 28:31.763
- Mom?
- Mrs Scott, you came.

28:32.265 --> 28:34.022
Yeah. Thought I should.

28:34.687 --> 28:36.004
I’m really glad you did.

28:39.879 --> 28:41.400
Wanna come meet my parents?

28:44.604 --> 28:46.908
Oh this is Dan, I really should take it.

28:59.858 --> 29:00.467
Hi.

29:04.148 --> 29:06.038
I was wondering if you were ever gonna come visit me.

29:06.221 --> 29:10.103
I was just… waiting for the right time

29:10.497 --> 29:14.118
and... I guess then I realised there wasn’t gonna be a right time so…

29:15.120 --> 29:16.177
here I am.

29:18.260 --> 29:21.675
I’m sorry Dan. About what happened with me and Deb. I...

29:22.345 --> 29:23.888
I wish I can take it all back.

29:25.177 --> 29:29.749
I haven’t been much of a brother to you Keith, or a husband to Deb, or a father.

29:31.752 --> 29:36.502
I guess I’ve just had other things on my mind; success, business.

29:40.685 --> 29:44.813
Well, you just worry about getting well. Okay?

29:45.125 --> 29:49.129
I’ll help out at the dealership till you… get back on your feet.

29:49.257 --> 29:51.893
I know you’re gonna have a very strong opinion about this but...

29:51.955 --> 29:53.623
Actually that would take a load off my mind.

29:57.559 --> 30:02.026
- You’re okay with that?
- Things change. People change.

30:04.878 --> 30:07.259
Oh, well okay then.

30:09.051 --> 30:12.363
Um… get well Danny.

30:27.406 --> 30:28.400
There you guys are.

30:28.901 --> 30:30.232
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:30.335 --> 30:33.247
Oh, now we’ve lost Nathan’s mom somewhere.

30:33.355 --> 30:34.532
She actually came?

30:34.769 --> 30:36.201
Guess she’s trying to make an effort.

30:36.784 --> 30:39.423
Well then… we will too.

30:40.436 --> 30:42.956
Oh, but first we have something to tell you.

30:43.376 --> 30:46.606
Oh yeah, it’s ah, well it’s kind of a wedding present.

30:47.002 --> 30:49.827
- Ah, for us.
- Okay. What is it?

30:49.921 --> 30:53.260
Well, we got ourselves an RV.

30:53.580 --> 30:56.646
You see, we always said when the last bird flew, we’d sell the coop,

30:56.830 --> 31:00.429
buy an RV and hit the road. Who knew someday was gonna be today?

31:01.126 --> 31:03.249
You guys are leaving town?

31:03.651 --> 31:04.766
Oh baby.

31:06.370 --> 31:12.503
The beauty of a motor home is that we can launch a sneak attack anytime and anywhere.

31:13.716 --> 31:15.905
This is how we set each other free.

31:35.430 --> 31:39.091
Uh... Peyton, right?

31:39.175 --> 31:41.114
- How do you know?
- Lucky guess.

31:44.954 --> 31:46.419
Coach! How are ya?

31:46.771 --> 31:49.813
Well I’m old, but I wasn’t always that way.

31:50.222 --> 31:53.879
There was a time when I was young and in love like the two of you.

31:55.732 --> 31:56.305
Here.

31:57.273 --> 32:01.482
Camilla stitched that during the first year of our marriage. It’s a baby blanket.

32:02.285 --> 32:05.704
Course, we spent all those years just the two of us in the nest

32:05.762 --> 32:09.566
but I think she’d like that to go to somebody she would have been really fond of.

32:09.694 --> 32:14.138
Oh coach, that’s so sweet of you, thank you, but I’m not pregnant.

32:15.957 --> 32:19.981
Well you never know; he is a Scott after all.

32:21.420 --> 32:22.961
Would you excuse me for just a minute?

32:23.255 --> 32:26.237
Yeah. Thanks coach.

32:27.177 --> 32:28.454
Okay, foot on orange.

32:32.525 --> 32:34.388
What do I have to do? Pee on a stick?

32:34.788 --> 32:38.173
Um… if that’s your kicks. Do I know what we’re talking about?

32:38.259 --> 32:40.501
Brooke, I am not pregnant.

32:41.767 --> 32:42.344
Look.

32:44.511 --> 32:46.933
It’s a birth control patch. I’ve had it for weeks.

32:49.503 --> 32:53.866
- So it really is just about love.
- Yeah. What other reason do we need?

32:57.419 --> 32:59.334
You did a good thing here Luke man.

32:59.609 --> 33:00.510
Thanks Skills.

33:01.724 --> 33:03.645
Hey, so I was thinking about Charleston right?

33:04.330 --> 33:07.100
And about how you could have been dis new person.

33:09.007 --> 33:13.480
Yeah well see, I remember the person that you used to be.

33:15.445 --> 33:16.901
Why not just be him again?

33:18.136 --> 33:19.036
Trust me.

33:20.240 --> 33:24.202
I mean you so lucky dawg, you surrounded by so many people who you love.

33:25.993 --> 33:29.045
You see, now you gotta make yourself one of those people.

33:31.257 --> 33:32.813
- Alright?
- Yeah.

33:33.608 --> 33:36.244
My dawg. I’ll be back

33:40.294 --> 33:43.135
- Hey.
- Oh hey! Where you been hiding?

33:43.305 --> 33:45.700
You know, just… had some things to take care of.

33:46.454 --> 33:49.290
Luke, I know how much Charleston meant to you.

33:50.185 --> 33:54.635
But… looks like I’m gonna be taking over the dealership until Dan gets better so…

33:55.320 --> 33:56.677
we’re gonna be living here for a while.

33:57.748 --> 33:58.465
You okay with that?

33:59.755 --> 34:02.837
Yeah. You know it’s probably better to get a fresh start with the people

34:02.950 --> 34:04.865
- who actually matter in your life right?
- Yeah.

34:08.647 --> 34:11.906
Um… speaking of, excuse me.

34:18.126 --> 34:19.984
You ladies throw a pretty rocking party.

34:20.679 --> 34:22.344
Yeah well, doesn’t suck.

34:23.721 --> 34:25.003
What are you smiling about?

34:25.253 --> 34:26.855
You didn’t read it, did you?

34:27.860 --> 34:30.025
- The letter.
- Oh.

34:30.389 --> 34:31.485
Course we did!

34:33.516 --> 34:36.230
Oh, so you were ok with the P.S. about the three of us?

34:36.302 --> 34:38.150
- Yeah, sure.
- Absolutely.

34:38.837 --> 34:40.362
Really? Really?

34:40.455 --> 34:44.274
So the threesome with the hot fudge didn’t bother you, huh?

34:48.967 --> 34:50.581
I knew we should have read the letter.

34:50.668 --> 34:51.891
We thought you’d left town.

34:52.435 --> 34:54.745
So we, sort of, burned it.

34:55.504 --> 34:58.252
Burned it, wow... You know what?

34:59.334 --> 35:04.534
I’m glad you didn’t read it. I mean all that stuff I said it’s not important now.

35:06.321 --> 35:08.845
And what matters now is that the three of us…

35:10.064 --> 35:11.273
we’re gonna be okay.

35:19.175 --> 35:19.988
Hey.

35:20.565 --> 35:21.186
Keith!

35:25.047 --> 35:28.245
Well… I’m back. I…

35:29.034 --> 35:32.264
I’ve decided to run the dealership for Dan, at least for a little while.

35:32.347 --> 35:34.042
You’ve given up a lot for Dan.

35:34.901 --> 35:36.806
He doesn’t deserve a brother like you.

35:40.385 --> 35:41.824
Actually, he deserves better.

35:51.301 --> 35:51.993
Mom.

35:53.487 --> 35:54.639
You met Haley’s parents?

35:54.998 --> 35:58.264
Hi, I’m Lydia James, this is my husband Jim.

35:58.403 --> 35:59.180
Hi, nice to meet you.

35:59.278 --> 35:59.917
Hi.

36:01.069 --> 36:04.740
Sorry to hear about your husband. How’s he doing?

36:05.320 --> 36:11.438
He’s... he’s struggling with a new reality, I suppose we both are.

36:14.940 --> 36:20.025
Well, I look forward to the day when we can all break bread and…

36:20.368 --> 36:24.839
argue about religion and politics and how best to raise our grandchildren.

36:24.909 --> 36:27.162
Yeah, no hurry on the last one by the way.

36:35.589 --> 36:37.075
Well you’ve raised a fine man.

36:37.560 --> 36:39.521
- He’s not a man.
- Sorry?

36:39.630 --> 36:44.033
I said he’s not a man, he’s a boy and none of this would have happened

36:44.104 --> 36:46.665
if you people had had enough common sense to stop it!

36:46.736 --> 36:47.780
- Mom!
- No!

36:47.909 --> 36:52.300
I am not going to stand here and make nice and pretend like this is all okay when it isn’t.

36:52.368 --> 36:55.568
Then don’t! It’s one thing for you to raise your voice at me

36:55.614 --> 36:58.481
but don’t come in here and dump on my parents!

36:58.833 --> 37:01.584
We made our decision, we got married and we’re happy

37:01.645 --> 37:04.261
and if you’re not here to celebrate with us, then you should just go home

37:04.318 --> 37:05.767
because I don’t want you here!

37:30.436 --> 37:31.562
Nicely played.

37:31.712 --> 37:35.938
I am so sorry. As if things aren’t bad enough with your family.

37:36.016 --> 37:37.383
You couldn’t make it any worse.

37:39.017 --> 37:40.194
You know what’s weird?

37:40.624 --> 37:45.882
Even with my parents leaving town, I have never felt safer in my life.

37:46.759 --> 37:47.834
You know what’s weirder?

37:48.473 --> 37:51.759
Seeing you take my mom’s head off back there actually kinda turned me on.

37:54.131 --> 37:56.363
- Five minutes in the elevator?
- How bout right here?

38:14.039 --> 38:17.463
I forgot how beautiful Nathan’s smile was until tonight.

38:18.380 --> 38:20.243
What hurts most is…

38:22.225 --> 38:23.966
it went away when he saw me.

38:24.109 --> 38:25.067
What happened?

38:25.235 --> 38:28.021
I bitched out Haley’s parents and made things worse.

38:29.434 --> 38:33.796
- Nice work.
- It’s not funny Dan. He has a new family now.

38:53.198 --> 38:54.241
Don’t worry.

38:55.250 --> 38:57.804
I promise, together we’ll get our son back.

39:04.296 --> 39:10.394
Ah, I guess it’s no surprise that some would criticize us; call us unfit parents.

39:10.493 --> 39:13.133
And normally… they would be right.

39:14.895 --> 39:17.973
And for those who say they’re too young, let me just say;

39:18.311 --> 39:22.073
hell you can drive at sixteen, go to war at eighteen,

39:22.335 --> 39:25.520
you can drink at twenty-one and retire at sixty-five

39:26.021 --> 39:27.935
so how old do you have to be…

39:28.427 --> 39:29.988
before your love…

39:30.797 --> 39:31.863
is real?

39:36.924 --> 39:38.617
So here’s to you Haley-bub,

39:39.835 --> 39:42.687
and Nathan; she’s your headache now.

39:48.616 --> 39:53.300
I think everybody… knows that Nathan and I got of to a pretty sketchy start.

39:53.741 --> 39:56.337
- Nathan; mutual hatred sound about right?
- Worse!

39:56.997 --> 39:57.792
Yeah.

40:02.061 --> 40:03.847
You see, then a funny thing happened;

40:05.922 --> 40:10.883
Haley. She showed me that you can find the good in everybody,

40:11.015 --> 40:12.592
if you just give them a chance.

40:13.591 --> 40:15.014
The benefit of the doubt.

40:18.977 --> 40:24.580
Sometimes, people disappoint you. Sometimes they surprise you.

40:28.234 --> 40:30.139
But you never really get to know them…

40:30.631 --> 40:34.409
until you listen for what’s in their hearts and that’s what Haley did with Nathan.

40:34.563 --> 40:35.854
That’s what we should do for them.

40:36.093 --> 40:39.396
So for you sceptics out there, prepare to be surprised.

40:41.127 --> 40:42.857
So this is to my…

40:43.364 --> 40:44.260
brother

40:45.669 --> 40:49.278
and my little sis in-law,

40:50.804 --> 40:51.869
and in love.

40:54.187 --> 40:55.519
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

42:36.535 --> 42:38.018
I’m glad you came, son.
