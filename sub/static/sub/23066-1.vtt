42:17.240 --> 42:19.275
Okay.

42:19.277 --> 42:22.677
This is the cerebral cortex.

42:22.679 --> 42:26.048
It is divided into
four sections called lobes,

42:26.050 --> 42:28.483
the frontal lobe,
the parietal lobe,

42:28.485 --> 42:32.188
the occipital lobe,
and the temporal lobe.

42:32.190 --> 42:34.423
Do you know
what these lobes do?

42:34.425 --> 42:36.592
I suppose you are going
to tell me.

42:36.594 --> 42:41.063
The frontal lobe
is associated with reasoning,

42:41.065 --> 42:44.266
speech, planning, emotions
and problem-solving.

42:44.268 --> 42:49.604
The parietal lobe controls
movement, orientation

42:49.606 --> 42:52.742
and the processing
and recognition of stimuli.

42:52.744 --> 42:56.445
The occipital lobe is associated
with visual processing,

42:56.447 --> 43:00.383
while the temporal lobe
is where we get the recognition

43:00.385 --> 43:05.086
and processing of auditory
stimuli and memory.

43:05.088 --> 43:07.490
Now this is a brain of a wolf.

43:07.492 --> 43:11.293
There's an area near
the primary auditory cortex

43:11.295 --> 43:13.695
which shows there
are striking similarities

43:13.697 --> 43:17.333
between the way the canine brain
and the human brain respond

43:17.335 --> 43:20.503
to emotionally loaded sounds.

43:20.505 --> 43:24.472
It is clear there is
a common response to emotion

43:24.474 --> 43:26.275
in both species.

Any of those hairy

Nope just some
Nazi fuck doctor.

It's burning,
what else can we do?

01:25:51.819 --> 01:25:55.120
I didn't see that Nazi
fuck doctor in the lab.

Good afternoon, Dr. Mengele.

01:27:51.707 --> 01:27:53.643
What the hell are you
doing in here?

01:27:57.779 --> 01:27:59.815
You remember me?

01:28:01.449 --> 01:28:03.750
Should I?

01:28:03.752 --> 01:28:05.485
The name's Murphy.

01:28:05.487 --> 01:28:08.854
We shared a few moments
in Camp 7,

01:28:08.856 --> 01:28:11.057
back in World War II.

The night that hellhole
burned to the ground.

01:28:13.994 --> 01:28:16.795
I remember,
what do you want?

01:28:16.797 --> 01:28:20.467
What I've wanted for
the past 30 long years, doc.

01:28:20.469 --> 01:28:22.872
To watch you die.

01:28:26.173 --> 01:28:30.442
If you just wanted me dead,
you could've done it by now.

01:28:30.444 --> 01:28:33.715
But obviously there is
something else on your mind.

01:28:35.283 --> 01:28:37.483
I'm just curious.

MENGELE:
About what?

01:28:39.154 --> 01:28:42.222
How does it feel to go
from being a high-ranking

01:28:42.224 --> 01:28:45.258
Nazi officer
to a shit-shoveling farmer

01:28:45.260 --> 01:28:47.930
in the South American
backwaters?

01:28:52.833 --> 01:28:55.968
I always have my memories.

01:28:55.970 --> 01:28:58.972
I guess you must be
feeling pretty pleased

01:28:58.974 --> 01:29:01.374
with yourself right about now?

01:29:01.376 --> 01:29:05.978
Why, you evaded our grasp,
you escaped the Allies,

01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:10.183
shit, boy,
the West German government

01:29:10.185 --> 01:29:13.255
have been looking for you
for years now.

01:29:14.823 --> 01:29:17.223
You actually
got away with that.

01:29:17.225 --> 01:29:21.527
But as you say, now I am
just a shit-shoveling farmer.

01:29:21.529 --> 01:29:23.862
That you are.

01:29:23.864 --> 01:29:25.831
A shit-shoveling farmer

01:29:25.833 --> 01:29:28.401
who has been on your mind
for 30 years,

01:29:28.403 --> 01:29:30.803
I can only begin to imagine
how troubling

01:29:30.805 --> 01:29:32.371
that must have been for you.

01:29:32.373 --> 01:29:35.275
I just don't like
loose ends now.

01:29:35.277 --> 01:29:39.314
And you're hoping
to finally tie this one up?

01:29:41.082 --> 01:29:44.017
You're looking for this?

01:29:44.019 --> 01:29:48.254
Yeah, I also got
the one in your shit house,

01:29:48.256 --> 01:29:51.023
I got the one
from under your bed too.

01:29:51.025 --> 01:29:55.294
You know I, I figure you
quite a paranoid guy, doc.

01:29:55.296 --> 01:29:57.996
But I guess looking over
your shoulder for the past

01:29:57.998 --> 01:30:00.433
30 years is gonna
do that to a man.

01:30:00.435 --> 01:30:05.304
I can only imagine just
how troubling that must be.

01:30:05.306 --> 01:30:08.607
I got the one from under
your pillow too, shitface.

01:30:08.609 --> 01:30:10.175
You can kill me,

01:30:10.177 --> 01:30:12.044
but I will still be alive
inside your head.

01:30:12.046 --> 01:30:14.214
You can't wipe away 30 years

01:30:14.216 --> 01:30:16.316
with one pull of the trigger.

01:30:16.318 --> 01:30:21.356

pull it more than once then.
