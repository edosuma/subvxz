Star!

00:59.093 --> 01:00.793
Time to go.

01:00.795 --> 01:03.395
You got some paint or something.
Right here.

01:06.032 --> 01:08.667
Marco, this is not paint.

01:08.669 --> 01:11.003
Well, looks like
you got another heart.

01:11.005 --> 01:12.771
Quiet, Marco.
This is serious!

01:12.773 --> 01:16.675
I think I'm going through
mewberty.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.110
Waaaahh....

01:18.112 --> 01:21.013
Weeellll, okay.

01:21.015 --> 01:22.981
Uh, mewberty. Heh heh.

01:22.983 --> 01:24.716
That's nothing
to be ashamed of.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.652
We have a similar thing
here on Earth.

01:26.654 --> 01:28.687
Don't confuse this with
your Earth things, Marco!

01:28.689 --> 01:30.189
I'm from Mewni!

01:30.191 --> 01:32.691
(whispers) This is
gonna get really weird.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.259
You gotta keep me
away from boys!

01:34.261 --> 01:38.130
Wait a second--
Marco's a boy.

01:38.132 --> 01:39.665
( nervous chuckle )

01:39.667 --> 01:41.333
When you say things
are gonna get weird,

01:41.335 --> 01:43.669
do you mean typical Star weird

01:43.671 --> 01:46.338
or, like,
destroy-the-school weird?

01:46.340 --> 01:48.207
Destroy-the-school.

01:48.209 --> 01:49.942
That's what I was
worried about.

01:49.944 --> 01:51.176
Let's get you home.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.814
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

01:55.816 --> 01:59.618
Okay, here comes a boy.
You got this. You got this.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.821
Avert your eyes.
Avert your eyes.

02:02.823 --> 02:07.359
Marco, I don't think
this is such a good ideaaahhh...

02:10.730 --> 02:12.297
Hmm. Huh?

02:12.299 --> 02:14.133
My turn.
Whoa.

02:14.135 --> 02:15.334
Okay, let's go.

02:16.336 --> 02:20.639
BOTH:
Whooooaaahhhh!

02:24.344 --> 02:25.878
I'm stuck.

02:25.880 --> 02:28.013
Um, let me help.
No!

02:28.015 --> 02:30.215
Your little boy hands
are part of the problem!

02:30.217 --> 02:32.784
Isn't there some way
I can help?

02:32.786 --> 02:35.654
Maybe there's something
in your book of spells
that can stop this.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.756
STAR: Maybe.
I'll go home and get it.

02:37.758 --> 02:40.325
It's not at home!
I gave it to Ferguson!

02:40.327 --> 02:42.327
Why?
I lost a bet, okay?

02:42.329 --> 02:44.163
Do you want to help me or not?

02:44.165 --> 02:47.132
Okay, but we gotta talk about
that betting thing later.

02:57.043 --> 02:59.044
Ferg.

02:59.046 --> 03:02.080

I need Star's

Huh. That wasn't so bad.
MAN: All right, boys,

03:51.732 --> 03:53.832
we're gonna do our warm-up
out here today.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.834
Pool's been compromised.

03:55.836 --> 03:59.104
Poop. It was poop.

03:59.106 --> 04:00.572
Somebody pooped
in the pool.

04:00.574 --> 04:03.275
Okay, let's get to it.

Um, no, thank you.

Awesome! What is it?

04:21.528 --> 04:25.397
We can do all  <i>kinds </i> of
witchy stuff with this thang.

04:25.399 --> 04:27.866
Can we use it to get
my parents to stop fighting?
Totally.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.534
Gimme that!
Let's get outta here!

04:29.536 --> 04:31.503
I've been looking
all over for this!

04:31.505 --> 04:32.904
Now that you found
your little book,

04:32.906 --> 04:34.906
let's make some magic
with it.

04:34.908 --> 04:36.441
I don't need your help, Jenna!

04:36.443 --> 04:37.876
Thank you.
Whatever.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.311
You'll need me soon enough,
Marco,

04:39.313 --> 04:42.147
'cause I got
your house keys.

04:42.149 --> 04:43.849
Arggh. Gotta stay focused.

04:43.851 --> 04:45.884
Mewberty, mewberty, mewberty...

04:45.886 --> 04:47.486
This doesn't
make any sense!

04:47.488 --> 04:49.187
Isn't there a glossary
in this thing?

04:50.423 --> 04:53.492
Did someone say Glossaryck?

04:53.494 --> 04:55.894
Wha?
'Cause that's me.

04:55.896 --> 04:58.463
Sir Glossaryck...

04:58.465 --> 05:00.165
Of Terms.

05:00.167 --> 05:02.567
At your service, milady.

05:02.569 --> 05:04.002
Uh, I'm not a milady.

05:05.872 --> 05:07.539
Coulda fooled me. Goodbye.

05:07.541 --> 05:11.143
No!
This book is not
for the likes of you!

05:11.145 --> 05:13.378
Magical princesses only!

05:13.380 --> 05:15.947
This isn't for me! I'm trying
to find a spell for Star!

05:15.949 --> 05:18.583
Ha ha ha!
Ah, Star Butterfly.

05:18.585 --> 05:19.851
What's wrong with her?

05:19.853 --> 05:21.987
She says she's got mewberty.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.489
I usually don't
make exceptions,

05:24.491 --> 05:28.026
but maybe we can
work something out.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.394
Pudding.
What?!

05:29.396 --> 05:31.229
I want pudding.
Pudding?

05:31.231 --> 05:32.531
Corrrrrrect.

05:32.533 --> 05:35.367

excellent pudding.

06:23.283 --> 06:25.417

07:19.339 --> 07:20.472
How do I make it stop?

07:20.474 --> 07:23.108
Well, can't stop it.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.342
That's not an option.

07:24.344 --> 07:26.578
It'll be over soon.

07:26.580 --> 07:30.315

Nature cannot be stopped.
That is all.

you can tell me than that!

07:58.612 --> 08:01.279
Ha ha ha ha!
Of course there is.

you're out of pudding.

12:22.576 --> 12:25.477

I-I made one mistake.

12:25.479 --> 12:28.313
You sure "Starred"
this whole thing up.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.782
How's it feel?
Not bad, right?

12:30.784 --> 12:34.786
Oh, Marco, now
we can be mess-up twins!

12:34.788 --> 12:37.555
What?! Man,
I ain't no twin!

12:37.557 --> 12:40.992

Marco, did you forget

14:09.950 --> 14:11.916
And, uh, this is for you.

14:11.918 --> 14:15.954
Go buy yourself some of those
thimble-sized shoes.

14:15.956 --> 14:19.457
I'm sorry, sir.
We only accept gold and jewels.

14:19.459 --> 14:22.560
You'll have to
work off the bill
in the shard mines.

Aaaaaah!

14:32.572 --> 14:34.606
Hey, guys.

14:34.608 --> 14:39.611
Wow, Marco, I could not
have Starred that one
better up myself.

14:39.613 --> 14:42.580
Like I was supposed to know
to bring jewels.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.582
Welcome to the shard mines.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.517
Now get to pickin'!

14:46.519 --> 14:50.088

Jeez!

14:53.159 --> 14:54.592

14:54.594 --> 14:57.462
Don't worry, Twindy.

These mines block magic.

15:08.642 --> 15:11.476
Okay, you want some of this?
Let's go, little man!

15:11.478 --> 15:13.177
Whoa, easy, Star.

15:13.179 --> 15:16.648
Okay, sir, I'm sure
we can work this out.

15:16.650 --> 15:19.751
See, this is
the Princess of Mewni,
Star Butterfly.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.619
Her dad has connections.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.488
And I'm King Fergon!

15:23.490 --> 15:27.158
Yeah, yeah.

( Ferguson sobbing )

15:47.046 --> 15:50.114
Empress, this prisoner
was disobedient.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.519
He looks  <i>delicious.</i>

15:54.521 --> 15:56.888
Eh?
Are you a king?

15:56.890 --> 15:59.157
Uh...this is a plunger.

15:59.159 --> 16:01.559
Tell me.
Are you betrothed?

16:01.561 --> 16:03.728
Yes. What is betrothed?

16:03.730 --> 16:05.029
( giggling )

16:05.031 --> 16:07.532
Oh, such wit!

16:07.534 --> 16:09.667
Whoa whoa whoa.
Are you, um...

16:09.669 --> 16:11.202
Are you, like, into me?

16:11.204 --> 16:12.737
Oh, big-time.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.839
Wow. Wow!

16:14.841 --> 16:16.240
All right!

16:16.242 --> 16:17.742
So, ya think you can
let my friends--

16:24.016 --> 16:27.685
( coughing )

16:27.687 --> 16:30.855
Looks like your friend's getting
a bad case of Pixie lung.

16:30.857 --> 16:32.256
This is crazy!

16:32.258 --> 16:34.859
We have to find a way
out of here and save Ferguson!

16:34.861 --> 16:38.963
Sorry, there's no way out,
not that I've seen.

16:38.965 --> 16:41.866
What about that mine cart?

16:41.868 --> 16:45.203
But that's the bathroom.
Like fried eggs.

16:45.205 --> 16:46.537
Come on!

16:46.539 --> 16:49.741
Guards! Seize them!

16:56.782 --> 17:01.986
I've never met anyone
with such beautiful,
soft, excess skin.

17:01.988 --> 17:03.921
( laughing ) Oh, yes!

17:03.923 --> 17:06.924
I try not to move
around too much.

17:06.926 --> 17:11.996
( screaming )

17:15.701 --> 17:17.635
( screaming )

17:26.545 --> 17:28.880
Hey! You should
watch where you're going!

17:28.882 --> 17:30.548
You watch
where  <i>you're </i> going!

17:34.653 --> 17:36.254
ALL: Uhh!
( all gasp )

17:37.189 --> 17:39.190
( chain saw buzzing )

17:39.192 --> 17:42.160
Hey! I was just about
to come rescue you guys!

17:42.162 --> 17:43.628
Ferguson!

17:43.630 --> 17:45.329
I was so worried!

17:45.331 --> 17:47.665
Yeah, turns out
they worship me here.

17:47.667 --> 17:50.034
<i>And </i> check out
my new girlfriend.

17:50.036 --> 17:52.303
That's right, I did,
I said "girlfriend."

17:52.305 --> 17:55.573
He calls me Sugar Wings.
( giggles )

17:56.341 --> 17:58.676
I am so happy
you guys are here.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.945
You're just in time
for my wedding!

18:00.947 --> 18:04.282
( Wedding March plays )

18:04.284 --> 18:09.320
Are you two ready
to swear your undying love
for each other?

18:09.322 --> 18:11.923
MARCO: Don't!
This is crazy!

18:11.925 --> 18:13.691
Ferguson, think about this!

18:13.693 --> 18:15.927
You're not ready
for this kind of commitment!

18:15.929 --> 18:17.695
You're only fourteen!

18:17.697 --> 18:20.231
You still paint a face
on your stomach
and make it talk!

18:23.268 --> 18:24.936
He has a point.

18:24.938 --> 18:28.372
Empress, you're an amazing
flying Pixie lady

18:28.374 --> 18:30.374
and you're really cool.

18:30.376 --> 18:32.944
but I didn't really
think this through.

18:34.179 --> 18:37.882
I'm sorry.
I can't marry you.

18:39.151 --> 18:41.285
Hmm.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.354
Guards, kill them all.

18:47.893 --> 18:49.293
Aaaah!

18:50.896 --> 18:52.630
Aayyahh!

18:54.800 --> 18:56.634
Aaaaah!

19:05.677 --> 19:08.112
Fly free, little Ferg!

19:09.781 --> 19:12.683
And I am saving  <i>you</i>
<i>for later.</i>

19:13.719 --> 19:16.087
Yaahh! Yaahh!

19:18.323 --> 19:20.758
Winter Storm Hyperblow!

19:29.268 --> 19:30.701
Let's go!

19:30.703 --> 19:33.204
EMPRESS: No! I haven't
killed you yet!

19:33.206 --> 19:35.106
Rainbow Fly Trap!

19:39.244 --> 19:42.013
I still think you're cool!

19:42.015 --> 19:45.683
Ohh. He was out of my league
anyway.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.252
That's it. I'm switching
service providers.

19:48.254 --> 19:50.154
Yeah, good call.

19:50.156 --> 19:53.090
Star, I feel bad.

19:53.092 --> 19:56.727
I think I may have ruined
Ferguson's one chance at love.

19:56.729 --> 19:59.197
Maybe we  <i>are </i> mess-up twins.

19:59.199 --> 20:03.701
Oh, Marco. That Pixie
didn't love Ferguson.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.469
She just wanted to eat him.

20:05.471 --> 20:07.471
Really?

20:07.473 --> 20:11.209
And let's be honest,
Ferguson does
look  <i>delicious.</i>

20:11.211 --> 20:12.710
( both laugh )

20:12.712 --> 20:14.845
Yeah, I guess
nobody's perfect.

20:14.847 --> 20:17.882
Uh, why are you guys
talking about me
like I'm not here?

20:17.884 --> 20:20.318
And where's Alfonzo?

20:20.320 --> 20:22.787
You may now kiss the bride.

20:23.989 --> 20:25.356
( spectators cheer )

20:25.358 --> 20:29.060
Yay! I will make
a great Pixie king!

20:29.062 --> 20:32.763
I'll be very tyrannical.
