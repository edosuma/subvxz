WEBVTT

01:07.760 --> 01:09.967
Says here you pressed
domestic violence charges

01:10.120 --> 01:13.846
three years ago against your
alleged assailant, Michael Vargas.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.561
He was convicted and served
12 months' probation.

01:21.680 --> 01:23.205
I'm sorry that happened to you.

01:23.360 --> 01:25.328
They dated for two years.

01:26.920 --> 01:30.561
And you were treated in
a psychiatric hospital after the incident.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.171
That was my choice.

01:32.360 --> 01:35.807
But after the restraining order was up,
you tried to resume contact.

01:36.600 --> 01:37.886
You tell me, Ms. Banks,

01:38.040 --> 01:41.761
after all this why would you wanna
go back and reunite with Mr. Vargas?

01:42.320 --> 01:43.321
No.

01:46.320 --> 01:48.766
We downloaded the contents
of Mr. Vargas' phone.

01:50.680 --> 01:55.841
I have almost 50 pages of Facebook
messages between you and Mr. Vargas.

02:01.600 --> 02:02.806
These belong to you?

02:07.520 --> 02:08.851
Yes.

02:11.160 --> 02:13.640
But you don't understand, I...

02:14.080 --> 02:20.042
The man is dead, found in your home,
with your face all over his phone

02:20.600 --> 02:22.125
and your delicates found in his car.

02:25.160 --> 02:27.401
Now you're gonna have to help me out here.

02:29.840 --> 02:32.650
That's what we always said
this company was about, right?

02:32.840 --> 02:35.923
Taking risks, adventures,
and bringing stories to life.

02:36.080 --> 02:38.082
Although she clearly didn't get the memo

02:38.240 --> 02:41.289
that mindset only applies
to adventures we have together.

02:42.920 --> 02:45.605
I could not be more thrilled
for her next chapter.

02:47.160 --> 02:50.682
To Julia, the woman who has
brought so many stories to life

02:50.840 --> 02:52.524
as our chief online editor

02:52.680 --> 02:55.001
- now gets to have a life of her own...
- Thank you.

02:55.160 --> 03:00.087
...and will be working remotely
in her pajama jeans and granny panties.

03:01.760 --> 03:04.491
To Julia. We love you.

03:06.480 --> 03:08.289
- Am I crazy?
- No.

03:08.440 --> 03:10.488
David is amazing, all right?

03:10.640 --> 03:14.122
And what happened with Michael
was not your fault.

03:15.160 --> 03:18.004
You are a survivor.

03:19.520 --> 03:22.205
Look, if the universe owes
anyone a solid, I think it's you.

03:24.800 --> 03:27.041
And you can always come home.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.007
- Well...
- Oh.

03:31.160 --> 03:33.288
With that ring, you're never coming home.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.369
Well, at least you know
you can if you want to.

03:35.520 --> 03:36.521
- Oh, God.
- Don't be mad.

03:36.680 --> 03:37.681
Got you a little something.

03:37.840 --> 03:39.569
- I hate you.
- I hate you, too.

03:39.880 --> 03:41.370
- This better have been on sale.
- It was.

03:41.520 --> 03:43.648
- And a re-gift.
- It was a re-gift. I've worn it.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.650
There's makeup on it.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.802
It is. It looked terrible on me.

03:47.960 --> 03:52.843
But it's for all those UV rays in Southern
California that'll be aging you prematurely.

03:53.040 --> 03:54.644
That's why I quit smoking.

03:56.160 --> 03:57.161
Oh, you have to eat this cake.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.845
This isn't the shitty cake
we get for the interns.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.843
- This is the real thing.
- Shh.

05:50.440 --> 05:52.283
Welcome home, Mrs. Connover.

05:53.240 --> 05:55.925
That's not my name yet, Mr. Connover.

05:56.120 --> 05:59.090
Well, I'm just practicing. How am I doing?

06:09.120 --> 06:10.281
Ten.

06:16.120 --> 06:18.930
I love it here, this house.

06:20.120 --> 06:21.963
You were born here.

06:23.120 --> 06:25.122
You grew up here.

06:26.760 --> 06:28.125
It's amazing.

06:29.080 --> 06:30.650
Really amazing.

06:32.600 --> 06:33.840
Well,

06:34.960 --> 06:38.442
now this is our home together, Mrs. Connover.

06:46.480 --> 06:48.005
Okay.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.802
- We actually have to get up now.
- Mmm-hmm.

06:51.080 --> 06:52.161
Mmm-hmm.

06:52.320 --> 06:53.321
Okay.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.005
Yeah. 'Cause Lily's coming over.

06:55.160 --> 06:56.525
Okay, I'm gonna get up.

06:56.680 --> 06:58.170
And Tessa.

06:58.320 --> 06:59.845
All right. All right...

07:00.000 --> 07:03.049
I'm up. I'm up. I'm up.

07:30.560 --> 07:31.721
There.

07:32.200 --> 07:33.929
Now you're perfect.

07:34.080 --> 07:35.764
Just like Mommy.

07:36.760 --> 07:37.761
And remember,

07:37.920 --> 07:42.050
if you miss me, and you wanna
come home, just tell Daddy, okay?

07:42.360 --> 07:43.521
Mmm-hmm.

07:55.400 --> 07:56.890
Hi, Lily Bean.

07:57.080 --> 07:58.650
- Hi, Daddy.
- Oh, let me get you out of there.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.086
All right.

08:00.240 --> 08:03.289
Oh, you're getting so big.
Okay, grab your backpack.

08:03.440 --> 08:04.646
Welcome to the neighborhood.

08:04.800 --> 08:07.087
This is so nice, Tessa. Thank you.

08:07.240 --> 08:09.447
You're very welcome.
I hope you'll be happy here.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.602
Me, too. I think I will be.

08:13.120 --> 08:16.410
I've prepared Lily's lunch for tomorrow
so that you don't need to bother with it.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.409
- Oh, you didn't have to.
- Not a problem.

08:18.600 --> 08:21.001
And David, please remember, bed time 7:30.

08:21.160 --> 08:24.448
No liquids after 6:00 unless we want
another accident. Right, sweetheart?

08:24.680 --> 08:25.966
Hey, we got this.

08:26.120 --> 08:28.248
- Okay.
- Right?

08:28.440 --> 08:29.851
- Mmm-hmm.
- Good. Say bye to Mommy.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.286
Bye, sweetheart.

08:31.440 --> 08:33.647
Mmm, I miss you already. See you
in a couple of days. Be good, okay?

08:33.799 --> 08:35.289
Okay, Mommy.

08:35.679 --> 08:36.919
Thanks.

08:37.120 --> 08:38.929
- Say hi to Julia.
- Hi, Julia.

08:39.280 --> 08:40.280
Hi, Lily.

08:41.440 --> 08:43.124
What's up, Oreo?

08:43.280 --> 08:45.442
You ready? You got him?
Oh, my God, he's so heavy.

08:45.600 --> 08:46.806
Let's go!

08:47.000 --> 08:49.480
Okay, let's take your stuff upstairs.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.165
Watch your head.

09:03.680 --> 09:04.966
I hope you like this blanket.

09:05.120 --> 09:07.043
I bought it at the flea market in Berkeley.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.281
Ooh.

09:08.480 --> 09:10.369
It has fleas?

09:10.800 --> 09:13.531
No, silly. Ah, it's just an expression.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.641
Daddy, where's my other blanket?

09:17.560 --> 09:18.800
Oh, well,

09:19.720 --> 09:23.322
it's up in a closet, but how about
we just try this one, just for tonight?

09:23.680 --> 09:25.648
Julia got it special for you, okay?

09:30.040 --> 09:32.088
I can get the other blanket.

09:57.240 --> 09:58.526
Bye-bye.

09:59.360 --> 10:00.600
Bye, babe.

10:16.520 --> 10:20.969
Restraining order against Michael Vargas

10:21.840 --> 10:24.241
expired.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.922
Julia, you're worthless.

10:38.240 --> 10:41.050
- Hey.
- Hey. You workin'?

10:41.800 --> 10:45.407
Not yet, uh, just got a cool new submission.

10:46.200 --> 10:47.247
A love story.

10:47.400 --> 10:50.404
Oh, that's great, Jules. Hey, listen.
Can you do me a favor?

10:50.560 --> 10:53.484
We're dressing bottles for three shipments
and we're way behind.

10:53.640 --> 10:56.883
Are you okay being alone
with Lily for dinner?

10:57.040 --> 10:58.804
Yeah, of course.

10:59.160 --> 11:01.481
Thank you. I'll see you later.

11:05.400 --> 11:06.925
I love those colors.

11:19.280 --> 11:22.363
Sorry to drop in on you like this.
Tomorrow is ballet.

11:22.520 --> 11:23.681
She forgot her shoes.

11:23.840 --> 11:24.841
Great. Thank you.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.929
And so you know, there are links on
the calendar to the Facebook group

11:28.120 --> 11:31.485
so you can stay informed on activities
and who brings snack when.

11:31.640 --> 11:32.926
I'm not on Facebook.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.880
Well, you can look at David's, I suppose.

11:37.280 --> 11:41.888
And he should really add you to
the pickup list, now that you're with us.

11:43.280 --> 11:45.089
- Mommy!
- Hi!

11:45.240 --> 11:47.641
- How you doin', sweetheart?
- I'm good.

11:48.240 --> 11:51.244
I was just getting dinner ready on the table.

11:51.400 --> 11:53.004
Okay.

11:53.760 --> 11:55.683
I love you.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.842
Mommy, can you stay for dinner?

11:59.320 --> 12:00.321
No, Lily.

12:00.600 --> 12:01.840
Please?

12:04.440 --> 12:06.010
Sure.

12:07.320 --> 12:08.845
I made plenty of food.

12:10.040 --> 12:11.280
Thank you.

12:21.120 --> 12:22.610
Don't just push your food around the plate.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.245
Julia's going to be very upset.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.047
It's okay, really.

12:31.360 --> 12:33.886
Cut with your knife, not your fork.

12:37.480 --> 12:38.481
I don't like it.

12:41.520 --> 12:44.251
I'm sorry. It might just be
a little too spicy for her.

12:48.520 --> 12:49.601
Mmm.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.409
I could get that.

12:53.560 --> 12:55.927
- Do you want pasta, sweetheart?
- Yes, please.

12:56.800 --> 12:58.370
Do you have anything organic?

13:01.040 --> 13:02.485
Yeah.

13:29.960 --> 13:33.089
All right, sweetheart. Go to sleep.

13:36.480 --> 13:38.323
Don't worry.

13:38.480 --> 13:42.087
In no time, you will be back with Mommy.

13:42.720 --> 13:44.131
Okay?

13:46.280 --> 13:47.486
I love you.

13:51.480 --> 13:53.084
Thanks for stopping by.

13:53.240 --> 13:54.605
Thank you for letting me stay.

13:58.240 --> 14:00.607
I didn't mean for this to happen.

14:00.880 --> 14:02.211
It's just hard sometimes.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.081
I get it.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.411
No, you don't.

14:07.560 --> 14:08.846
You couldn't possibly.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.443
That's not your fault.

14:15.640 --> 14:16.641
Good night, Julia.

14:17.280 --> 14:18.691
Good night, Tessa.

14:59.720 --> 15:01.131
David?

15:22.760 --> 15:24.000
David?

16:01.680 --> 16:03.648
Hey!

16:04.080 --> 16:05.525
You okay?

16:05.920 --> 16:07.445
You look like you saw a ghost.

16:07.920 --> 16:09.649
Yeah, I'm sorry. I just...

16:10.680 --> 16:11.727
Hi.

16:12.120 --> 16:13.326
Daddy!

16:15.920 --> 16:17.081
Hmm.

16:17.520 --> 16:19.329
I'll fix you some leftovers.

16:19.480 --> 16:20.891
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.366
It's all right.

16:23.240 --> 16:24.810
I'm coming, Lily.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.163
Tessa only gets Lily two days
this week, you know?

16:30.800 --> 16:33.770
These weeks are really hard for her.

16:33.920 --> 16:36.400
I'm sure that's why she came over.

16:40.320 --> 16:41.685
Mmm.

16:42.120 --> 16:43.724
This is great, by the way.

16:43.880 --> 16:45.928
Someone else didn't think so.

16:47.560 --> 16:48.925
Come here.

16:50.360 --> 16:52.727
You'll get used to mac and cheese.

16:54.440 --> 16:56.488
You'll get used to Tessa.

16:56.680 --> 16:58.409
And she'll calm down.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.968
She's adjusting, too.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.681
I just wanna be good at this.

17:06.760 --> 17:09.330
I mean, I will be good at this. I just...

17:12.079 --> 17:15.242
I wish I had a more
normal childhood to draw from.

17:17.280 --> 17:18.486
Hey.

17:19.800 --> 17:22.166
You are not your mom.

17:22.760 --> 17:25.444
And I'm about a half a bottle of Scotch
a day away from being your dad.

17:25.599 --> 17:27.250
Thank God.

17:28.640 --> 17:31.211
You just keep being you.

17:32.760 --> 17:33.966
Hmm?

17:34.960 --> 17:37.406
It'll all work out, I promise.

17:37.680 --> 17:41.002
Well, that tastes cuddly.
Let me get a bite of that.

17:41.200 --> 17:43.931
I'm just gonna have a taste. Mmm-hmm.

17:44.240 --> 17:45.605
Okay, okay.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.922
She woke up just moments ago.

17:48.080 --> 17:50.287
- Hush.
- Let's not have nookie in the kitchen.

17:50.440 --> 17:51.851
She's a heavy sleeper.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.445
No, she's not.

17:54.320 --> 17:55.810
Come here.

17:56.520 --> 17:58.124
Let's go upstairs.

18:54.640 --> 18:57.007
I mean, I know she's Lily's mother
and of course I respect that.

18:57.160 --> 19:00.130
But it feels like I'm stepping into her life.

19:00.320 --> 19:01.401
Whoa.

19:01.560 --> 19:03.881
Jules, listen to me, okay?

19:04.080 --> 19:06.401
Think about where you were
a few years ago, all right?

19:06.560 --> 19:09.370
That was hard. That was life and death stuff.

19:09.520 --> 19:11.921
This is just life stuff, all right?

19:12.920 --> 19:13.967
And remember,

19:14.120 --> 19:18.284
your life is so much bigger than just
Prince Charming and his little princess.

19:18.640 --> 19:20.210
Thank you, Al.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.203
And hey, you're late on your chapter.

19:22.360 --> 19:23.566
Get back to work, woman.

19:23.760 --> 19:25.000
Bye-bye!

19:28.880 --> 19:32.248
It's a beautiful dress. Beautiful on you.

19:34.160 --> 19:35.810
It's perfect.

19:40.120 --> 19:43.761
We can lift the neckline a little here.

19:46.760 --> 19:49.366
You're David Connover's girlfriend, right?

19:49.520 --> 19:50.726
Yeah.

19:50.960 --> 19:51.961
Small town.

19:53.440 --> 19:56.284
Tess is one of my best customers.

20:00.760 --> 20:04.447
Well, it's time to tell Tessa
and Lily that we're getting married.

20:05.080 --> 20:08.484
It's not fair to her, and she needs to know.

20:08.680 --> 20:09.886
Hey.

20:10.280 --> 20:11.770
I agree.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.571
I just wanted you to get here
and get a chance to get settled.

20:14.720 --> 20:18.964
Let Lily get comfortable with you.
But, I agree. Okay?

20:19.120 --> 20:20.121
Come on.

20:20.960 --> 20:22.803
Orange sunsets, skies a blue...

20:23.320 --> 20:25.641
California, we love you.

20:26.480 --> 20:27.481
- All perfect.
- Thanks.

20:29.360 --> 20:31.362
Aw. My baby girl.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.642
All right, give Mommy a hug.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.843
Okay, Lily Bean.

20:40.080 --> 20:41.889
I love you, honey.

20:42.040 --> 20:45.123
And I'm so proud of all your work.
I love seeing your classroom.

20:45.280 --> 20:46.645
Thanks, Mommy. See you tomorrow.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.404
All right, sweetheart. Be good.

20:48.600 --> 20:50.011
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:50.160 --> 20:51.446
Are you ready?

20:51.640 --> 20:53.290
Bye. Thanks. Here we go.

20:56.400 --> 20:58.289
- Are you ready?
- Mmm-hmm.

20:59.200 --> 21:00.406
Nice.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.604
Julia, what was your favorite?

21:06.840 --> 21:10.242
Well, I really loved the noodle rainbow.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.648
- I get to eat that one, right?
- No!

21:13.120 --> 21:14.849
- What?
- You can't eat that!

21:15.040 --> 21:16.371
What? Wait, what? I wanted some, too!

21:16.520 --> 21:18.045
But it seemed yummy!

21:21.200 --> 21:22.201
Oh, all right.

21:22.360 --> 21:24.169
You ready? Okay.

21:24.360 --> 21:27.045
One, two, three.

21:28.880 --> 21:30.120
Again!

21:52.640 --> 21:54.244
Stop it! Stop it.

21:56.360 --> 21:58.931
Now, it's a small deal, but a big leap,

21:59.400 --> 22:02.643
and we are so proud to be
getting our little brewery

22:02.840 --> 22:05.002
into its first franchise deal.

22:05.160 --> 22:07.447
Whoo!

22:09.040 --> 22:11.361
Miguel, thanks for
signing on to this with me.

22:11.840 --> 22:14.844
And to his lovely wife, Sarah, our lawyer...

22:15.000 --> 22:16.081
I still can't pay you.

22:18.040 --> 22:20.327
A lot of you guys here saw me
through a rough time

22:20.520 --> 22:22.284
when my dad got sick and passed away

22:22.480 --> 22:25.848
and that's what made me realize
that this is where I belong.

22:27.080 --> 22:30.050
And to those of you who thought
I was crazy for quitting Merrill Lynch

22:30.240 --> 22:33.449
and brewing beer in my garage, well,

22:33.720 --> 22:34.926
you were wrong.

22:35.440 --> 22:37.329
Here's to chasing dreams, guys.

22:37.720 --> 22:40.326
I sure as hell feel like
mine are coming true.

22:40.640 --> 22:41.926
Cheers!

22:47.840 --> 22:48.841
Thanks, man.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.001
Hold this.

22:50.160 --> 22:52.288
Overdressed as usual.

22:56.440 --> 22:57.487
Hey, guys.

22:57.640 --> 23:00.166
I just wanted to say a few words.

23:00.520 --> 23:04.206
I've known David a long time. Since Stanford.

23:04.520 --> 23:06.602
A very long time.

23:06.760 --> 23:09.969
I always knew you were destined
for great things.

23:10.560 --> 23:13.848
I just thought it would be on Wall Street.
Not Main Street.

23:14.720 --> 23:16.131
I'll be the first to admit...

23:16.280 --> 23:20.569
I wasn't thrilled with picking up
our family, packing, and moving

23:20.720 --> 23:24.884
and changing our lives
so you could chase this crazy dream.

23:25.360 --> 23:26.646
But I did.

23:28.200 --> 23:33.042
I may not have always agreed with your
choices, David, but I always believed in you.

23:34.800 --> 23:38.521
So here's to our brewery!
The best in the West.

23:38.680 --> 23:41.604
Watch. She won't even take a sip.
Too many calories.

23:57.120 --> 23:58.451
Wanna dance?

23:58.600 --> 23:59.931
Mmm.

24:02.040 --> 24:03.041
I'm leaving, too.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.043
- Bye. I'll call you tomorrow.
- You look so beautiful.

24:05.200 --> 24:06.281
Bye.

24:15.360 --> 24:16.361
Hi.

24:17.880 --> 24:19.120
Can I get you anything?

24:20.440 --> 24:22.329
Aren't you sweet?

24:22.520 --> 24:24.170
No. I'm good. Thank you.

25:48.320 --> 25:49.446
You should go now.

25:52.520 --> 25:54.045
Go! Now!

26:06.760 --> 26:07.761
Nothing?

26:08.080 --> 26:09.684
No, I can't find it anywhere.

26:09.880 --> 26:13.168
Well, it's not downstairs.
Maybe you left it in the car.

26:13.320 --> 26:16.130
No, I checked every inch of the car.

26:18.600 --> 26:19.840
Will you call it again?

26:20.000 --> 26:21.001
Yeah.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.923
12/02/81.

26:41.880 --> 26:45.726
1-2-8-1.

26:47.120 --> 26:49.168
1-2-0-2.

26:51.240 --> 26:52.401
8-1.

28:17.880 --> 28:20.201
Tessa, what is it?

28:21.880 --> 28:23.723
David, I've been thinking.

28:25.480 --> 28:27.721
How well do you really know Julia?

28:28.360 --> 28:30.840
Don't you think this is moving a little fast?

28:31.080 --> 28:33.003
No, I don't.

28:33.160 --> 28:36.531
And to be clear, I'm not asking
your permission, Tessa.

28:38.680 --> 28:39.920
I know.

28:41.440 --> 28:42.805
It's just...

28:44.760 --> 28:46.205
She could be anybody.

28:47.720 --> 28:50.200
She's not just anybody. In fact,

28:52.160 --> 28:53.491
um...

28:54.720 --> 28:56.882
I have some news.

28:57.400 --> 28:59.448
Julia and I

28:59.600 --> 29:01.443
are getting married.

29:03.400 --> 29:05.050
That's wonderful.

29:05.600 --> 29:07.170
I'm happy for you.

29:08.440 --> 29:10.727
Thank you. I appreciate it.

29:12.040 --> 29:13.565
I'm just worried about Lily.

29:13.720 --> 29:16.246
Yeah, I understand.
And she's doing great with Lily.

29:16.440 --> 29:17.646
And she's trying really hard.

29:17.800 --> 29:20.883
I know. I see that she's trying.

29:21.040 --> 29:22.644
But she has no idea how to parent.

29:23.040 --> 29:25.725
Lily has a rash now from some old blanket.

29:25.880 --> 29:27.609
She has no idea what to feed a child.

29:27.760 --> 29:30.764
I had to come over the other day
to get Lily to eat and put her to bed.

29:30.920 --> 29:33.764
And Lily told me she heard her scream
in the middle of the night.

29:35.720 --> 29:37.165
We're all figuring it out.

29:37.320 --> 29:38.560
Come on.

29:42.720 --> 29:44.131
I'm sorry, David.

29:46.200 --> 29:50.524
I'm sorry that we even
have to be talking about this.

29:50.880 --> 29:52.086
Huh.

29:52.480 --> 29:56.007
There isn't a day that goes by
that I don't regret...

29:56.160 --> 29:57.525
Tessa,

29:58.200 --> 29:59.247
goodbye.

30:13.720 --> 30:14.801
Hey!

30:15.000 --> 30:16.525
Look what I found.

30:18.200 --> 30:19.326
Great! Where was it?

30:19.480 --> 30:21.323
In the car. Under the seat.

30:21.640 --> 30:23.165
Okay, I looked there.

30:23.320 --> 30:24.890
I'ma go make a sandwich. You want anything?

30:25.040 --> 30:26.405
Yes, please.

30:26.800 --> 30:30.124
And, babe, set up
your phone tracker app, please.

30:30.280 --> 30:31.486
Mmm-hmm.

30:40.520 --> 30:41.681
Hello?

30:44.800 --> 30:46.006
Hello?

30:53.200 --> 30:56.124
Of all the days to drop you off late.

30:56.360 --> 30:59.045
And your hair is a mess.

30:59.200 --> 31:01.601
Julia should never have
sent you home like this.

31:01.760 --> 31:04.525
- Sorry.
- It's not your fault.

31:06.840 --> 31:09.969
Do you miss when Mommy and Daddy
lived together?

31:11.400 --> 31:13.164
When I was really little?

31:13.320 --> 31:15.049
You weren't that little.

31:17.080 --> 31:18.570
I don't remember.

31:23.960 --> 31:25.803
She's here! Lovey's here!

31:25.960 --> 31:28.611
Let me finish your hair.
Lovey can wait a moment.

31:47.320 --> 31:48.401
Oh, you didn't bake the scones?

31:50.400 --> 31:52.164
They're from Colfax Cafe, Mother.

31:52.320 --> 31:54.129
Your favorite.

32:02.800 --> 32:03.801
You're dragging your knife.

32:04.520 --> 32:06.648
And the silver needs polishing.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.163
I understand
that your father is getting married.

32:11.400 --> 32:12.606
Uh-huh.

32:13.360 --> 32:17.001
Well, I'm sure Daddy's girlfriend
is a very nice person.

32:17.520 --> 32:18.681
Do you like her?

32:19.360 --> 32:20.600
I guess so.

32:20.760 --> 32:22.125
She has long brown hair.

32:22.280 --> 32:23.327
Oh.

32:23.480 --> 32:26.211
- I made you a bracelet, Lovey! Wanna see?
- Not now.

32:26.360 --> 32:29.045
Oh, she can show me if she wants.

32:33.880 --> 32:34.881
You look tired.

32:37.160 --> 32:38.889
I'm not.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.809
I'll take you to see Dr. McKee.

32:49.960 --> 32:54.121
A good dermatologist is your best friend and
it is time for you to pull yourself together

32:54.320 --> 32:55.560
and get a new David.

32:55.720 --> 32:58.644
For your sake, and for Lily's.

32:58.800 --> 33:00.086
I need some time.

33:00.640 --> 33:02.881
Time doesn't exist at your age.

33:03.360 --> 33:06.091
David has moved on and so should you.

33:07.240 --> 33:09.242
Maybe I'll get a job.

33:09.840 --> 33:11.842
I do have a degree, you know.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.927
It's not easy, all this change.

33:17.080 --> 33:18.844
Maybe you should have
thought of that before you...

33:19.000 --> 33:20.365
Mother.

33:20.880 --> 33:22.609
Not again, please.

33:23.760 --> 33:27.560
I tried so hard to cement things with David.

33:27.720 --> 33:31.611
I told you, having his baby would work.

33:32.520 --> 33:36.684
And Lily was living, breathing,
perfect cement.

33:37.080 --> 33:38.730
Then you ruined it.

33:40.600 --> 33:42.284
There's no going back.

33:45.440 --> 33:48.091
I just want you to be happy.

33:48.240 --> 33:50.766
I don't want you to be alone.

34:19.560 --> 34:21.164
Okay, Lovey.

34:24.560 --> 34:25.641
Yay!

34:27.320 --> 34:28.481
Okay!

34:29.400 --> 34:32.449
You're ready for the runway. I love it!

34:32.600 --> 34:36.241
That's it. Chin up. Shoulders back.
That's my girl.

34:37.080 --> 34:39.161
It's nice to see David so happy.

34:39.320 --> 34:42.444
It's also really nice to come over here
and not feel like I'm walking on eggshells.

34:42.639 --> 34:44.404
- That bad, huh?
- Mmm-hmm.

34:45.520 --> 34:49.127
Well, things didn't actually work out
for Tess the way she wanted.

34:49.280 --> 34:51.168
In more ways than one.

34:51.320 --> 34:52.367
What do you mean?

34:52.520 --> 34:55.364
Well, at first we thought Tessa was amazing.

34:55.679 --> 34:59.844
Star at Stanford, super charming,
so together,

35:00.000 --> 35:02.446
all the big firms were recruiting her, too.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.329
But then she changed,

35:04.480 --> 35:08.371
got possessive, turned into Gollum
and David was her precious.

35:08.520 --> 35:09.601
Oh, wow.

35:09.760 --> 35:12.969
We were thrilled when
David finally broke up with her.

35:13.200 --> 35:16.363
Then, turns out she was pregnant.

35:16.520 --> 35:18.010
That's perfect, right?

35:18.160 --> 35:22.484
So, she and her mother, Cruella Chanel,
moved with David to New York.

35:22.680 --> 35:25.729
'Cause you know David,
he did the right thing.

35:28.160 --> 35:30.561
And then she had to watch him
leave it all behind for the brewery.

35:30.720 --> 35:31.721
Bingo.

35:37.520 --> 35:39.409
We go to the Brew Pub in San Francisco,

35:39.560 --> 35:43.406
walk in, and I just, I just see her
sitting across the restaurant,

35:43.560 --> 35:44.846
talking to her crazy friend...

35:46.880 --> 35:48.166
And... I got it, I got it.

35:48.320 --> 35:49.731
I got it.

35:49.880 --> 35:50.881
Okay.

35:51.080 --> 35:53.082
I know what happened. He bailed on me.

35:53.560 --> 35:57.246
I wouldn't say bail as left you in charge.

35:59.200 --> 36:00.884
Hello.

36:02.520 --> 36:04.488
Who is this?

36:12.040 --> 36:14.771
So I just walked over.
I don't know what came over me

36:14.920 --> 36:17.161
and I just said,
"I'm not leaving here until...

36:17.360 --> 36:18.850
"Until I meet you. I'm sorry."

36:19.000 --> 36:21.446
And, uh... Huh. Who was it?

36:21.600 --> 36:22.886
Ali. I'll call her back later.

36:23.040 --> 36:24.087
Oh, see?

36:24.280 --> 36:27.284
Crazy friend, Ali again.
Anyway, uh, I don't know what...

39:59.000 --> 40:02.163
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Just saw a man leaving.

40:02.600 --> 40:03.647
It was a delivery.

40:03.800 --> 40:05.484
Tessa, why are you here?

40:06.440 --> 40:07.851
At our house?

40:09.200 --> 40:11.168
David's jury summons came to me.

40:11.320 --> 40:13.846
He did live there for years.

40:16.200 --> 40:18.328
It's not always all about you, Julia.

40:18.520 --> 40:21.490
If you're going to be a parent,
especially to my daughter,

40:21.640 --> 40:23.961
I'd like you to learn that lesson. Fast.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.684
You're sure they're not from David Connover?

40:36.800 --> 40:39.565
And what do you mean there's no record
of who sent the arrangement?

40:39.720 --> 40:41.051
How is that possible?

40:41.200 --> 40:42.361
The order was done anonymously.

40:42.520 --> 40:43.681
I'm not sure where it's coming from.

40:43.840 --> 40:45.808
- Okay.
- Sorry about that.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.889
- Thank you.
- Have a nice day.

40:56.920 --> 40:58.684
Jules! We're home.

40:59.200 --> 41:00.565
Hi, Julia.

41:24.760 --> 41:26.444
No! Go to sleep!

42:21.680 --> 42:25.610
Well, maybe it's because the restraining
order is up and I can't renew it.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.446
But I just feel like it's him
making these calls.

42:29.080 --> 42:32.482
Take a deep breath, all right?
No one knows where you live.

42:32.640 --> 42:36.486
You're not on Facebook or Twitter.
You basically don't exist.

42:36.840 --> 42:38.365
And this has happened before.

42:38.520 --> 42:41.803
Remember when we were up in Big Sur and you
thought he was following us in that truck?

42:41.960 --> 42:43.849
- Yeah, but...
- Or you thought you saw him at the window,

42:44.040 --> 42:46.520
but it was really just David.

42:49.320 --> 42:50.970
You're right.

42:51.480 --> 42:53.369
You still haven't told David
what happened to you, huh?

42:54.480 --> 42:57.211
It's gonna be really hard to tell him, Ali.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.365
Really hard.

43:00.720 --> 43:03.724
I don't want him to see me like that.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.843
I don't want it to change anything.

43:07.560 --> 43:10.891
Hey, what about calling that doctor
that you liked so much at The Meadows?

43:11.040 --> 43:12.121
No.

43:13.880 --> 43:15.405
I'm okay.

43:18.840 --> 43:20.649
He'll love me no matter what, right?

43:20.800 --> 43:23.201
There is nothing not to love.

43:23.360 --> 43:25.408
I love you and I don't even like people.

43:26.840 --> 43:27.841
Jules?

43:28.360 --> 43:29.850
I gotta go.

43:30.240 --> 43:31.685
I love you, too.

43:34.840 --> 43:35.887
Hey.

43:36.200 --> 43:37.201
Hey.

43:39.360 --> 43:41.362
Sorry, I just couldn't sleep.

43:42.360 --> 43:44.522
Well, is everything okay?

43:48.040 --> 43:49.201
Yeah.

43:51.360 --> 43:52.407
Come on.

45:36.080 --> 45:37.161
Hmm.

46:00.200 --> 46:02.771
Well, just go with a little black dress.
You've got one. It's perfect.

46:02.920 --> 46:05.161
- Okay.
- And I love these earrings. Use these.

46:05.360 --> 46:06.441
- These are nice.
- Thank you.

46:06.600 --> 46:08.364
Look, I think you got the whole look.
You'll be fine.

46:08.640 --> 46:10.005
- I think so.
- I wouldn't, uh...

46:11.600 --> 46:12.601
Hi, Julia.

46:13.360 --> 46:14.361
Hi, Tessa.

46:14.520 --> 46:15.965
I'll see you.

46:19.280 --> 46:22.329
Just finished a board meeting
at Lily's school.

46:23.320 --> 46:26.324
I'm never quite sure what to do
with the alone time.

46:26.720 --> 46:28.529
Yeah. These days, me, too.

46:30.520 --> 46:32.329
- Listen, Julia. I...
- No, about yesterday...

46:32.480 --> 46:34.130
No, no. I came by unannounced. It was...

46:34.280 --> 46:36.123
No, I shouldn't have talked to you like that.

46:36.280 --> 46:37.964
I know I can come on a bit strong.

46:38.120 --> 46:39.485
No.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.970
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have snapped at you.

46:44.040 --> 46:46.327
Forgiven. It happens.

46:49.160 --> 46:50.525
Thanks, Tessa.

46:53.160 --> 46:54.241
Can I buy you lunch?

46:57.240 --> 46:58.241
Yeah.

46:58.800 --> 46:59.926
Good.

47:00.480 --> 47:01.481
Good.

47:02.480 --> 47:05.404
Yeah, this town really
is its own little world, isn't it?

47:06.080 --> 47:09.368
Yeah. I forgot how hard it is
to move to a new place.

47:09.520 --> 47:10.726
Tell me about it.

47:10.880 --> 47:12.928
It was hard for me to move here, too.

47:14.080 --> 47:17.004
And now it seems like
you've been here forever.

47:17.160 --> 47:18.207
It took a while.

47:18.360 --> 47:20.601
Then everything fell apart.

47:20.760 --> 47:22.205
Or I tore it apart.

47:22.400 --> 47:23.606
Either way.

47:25.440 --> 47:28.444
I assume David told you.

47:28.600 --> 47:30.284
It was my affair that ended everything.

47:31.480 --> 47:33.323
Oh. Um...

47:34.160 --> 47:35.161
Yes.

47:37.120 --> 47:39.771
Affair is too strong a word for it.

47:40.440 --> 47:44.764
It was really only twice.
I was just so frustrated and isolated.

47:44.960 --> 47:46.883
David was consumed with work.

47:47.040 --> 47:49.805
Always home late.
He barely even knew I existed.

47:50.120 --> 47:51.610
I mean, everything you just said.

47:52.080 --> 47:54.367
You don't know anybody, you're lonely.

47:54.800 --> 47:58.771
Your whole life is in flux, but he's
having a completely different experience.

48:00.120 --> 48:01.565
You have far more going on.

48:02.640 --> 48:05.291
I only had David and Lily.

48:05.920 --> 48:07.809
She's so sweet, by the way.

48:08.800 --> 48:10.484
She is. Thank you.

48:14.480 --> 48:16.244
- Thank you, Val.
- Thank you.

48:20.000 --> 48:21.650
Mmm.

48:23.800 --> 48:25.006
Julia,

48:25.600 --> 48:27.568
can I confess something?

48:28.120 --> 48:29.610
Sure. Yes.

48:29.800 --> 48:33.088
I was...
I was really very scared to meet you.

48:33.240 --> 48:36.164
- Me?
- Yes! It's intimidating.

48:36.320 --> 48:39.164
This glamorous life in the city.
You're an editor

48:39.320 --> 48:42.164
and gorgeous and talented
and effortlessly beautiful.

48:42.320 --> 48:44.971
Thank you. That's very lovely of you to say,

48:45.120 --> 48:48.363
and I was terrified to meet you.

48:48.960 --> 48:51.531
I mean, obviously because
of Lily and everything,

48:51.680 --> 48:53.648
but then on top of that, you're perfect.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.365
All the time.

48:55.520 --> 48:58.330
Thank you. You're gonna do great here.

48:58.680 --> 49:00.125
And your connection with David, it's...

49:01.320 --> 49:03.163
You talk, you laugh.

49:04.000 --> 49:05.604
What? You didn't?

49:06.040 --> 49:07.166
Not really.

49:07.320 --> 49:08.685
Come on.

49:11.040 --> 49:13.884
We always loved each other. Of course.

49:14.120 --> 49:15.884
But ours was a more physical thing.

49:16.880 --> 49:18.962
We always had incredible chemistry.

49:20.120 --> 49:23.363
David was insatiable. It eclipsed everything.

49:23.560 --> 49:25.289
Frankly, it was a little exhausting.

49:26.000 --> 49:27.684
A different position every night.

49:27.840 --> 49:29.205
Public places.

49:29.880 --> 49:33.043
It's like we just could not
get away from each other.

49:34.120 --> 49:37.567
But I'm sure I don't have
to tell you how he is.

49:40.560 --> 49:42.881
Yeah. He's amazing.

49:43.360 --> 49:47.367
You know there was a time when I thought
we were on the road to getting back together.

49:48.160 --> 49:50.561
We even went to therapy.

49:51.920 --> 49:54.207
But then he met you.

49:57.360 --> 49:59.408
We'll always be close.

49:59.760 --> 50:02.684
You can't get any closer
than having a child together.

50:02.840 --> 50:05.207
The infinite bond
of our gorgeous little girl.

50:09.920 --> 50:12.446
Oh, I keep forgetting. Let me see the ring.

50:13.360 --> 50:15.249
Oh. Um...

50:15.920 --> 50:17.001
It's getting cleaned.

50:17.560 --> 50:20.245
Yeah, it was David's grandmother's ring.

50:20.680 --> 50:21.920
Oh.

50:23.920 --> 50:26.764
Well, next time.
I really actually have to get going.

50:26.960 --> 50:28.450
I'm buying Lily a new horse.

50:28.600 --> 50:32.127
Upgrading from the pony she usually rides.
She's really excited.

50:32.520 --> 50:33.521
I bet.

50:33.680 --> 50:36.763
I'm really glad that we did this.
It was nice.

50:38.240 --> 50:39.810
I'll see you soon.

51:21.000 --> 51:22.331
We're certified organic.

51:22.480 --> 51:23.766
I'm hungry.

51:23.920 --> 51:26.844
Me, too. We're gonna wait
till we get to Daddy's booth

51:27.000 --> 51:29.162
and then we're gonna have lunch
with him, okay?

51:30.920 --> 51:33.685
This is probably him.

51:39.440 --> 51:41.010
Who is this?

51:44.880 --> 51:46.928
Who is this?

51:53.720 --> 51:55.051
Come on.

51:57.360 --> 51:58.691
Lily?

52:00.520 --> 52:02.090
But I couldn't stop.

52:04.760 --> 52:06.364
Lily?

52:07.160 --> 52:08.161
Lily!

52:26.880 --> 52:28.041
Hey!

52:28.920 --> 52:30.365
What happened? Where's Lily?

52:30.520 --> 52:32.249
I don't know. She just ran off.

52:32.400 --> 52:33.925
Okay, how long ago did you lose her?

52:34.280 --> 52:36.567
Just now. A few minutes ago, maybe.
I don't know.

52:36.720 --> 52:37.926
David, shit, I'm sorry.

52:38.080 --> 52:40.162
I'm gonna get security.
You just keep looking, okay?

52:40.320 --> 52:41.321
Okay.

52:41.480 --> 52:42.561
Guys, hold down the fort. I'll be right back.

52:42.760 --> 52:43.761
You got it.

52:43.920 --> 52:45.206
Lily!

52:45.560 --> 52:46.766
Lily?

53:04.640 --> 53:05.801
Okay.

53:06.920 --> 53:08.160
Okay.

53:09.280 --> 53:10.441
Lily!

53:14.280 --> 53:15.281
Lily!

53:15.440 --> 53:16.771
Lily!

53:17.120 --> 53:19.930
Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

53:20.600 --> 53:21.601
I'm sorry.

53:35.080 --> 53:37.811
Just wandering around by herself,
and I saw her talking to some guy

53:38.160 --> 53:40.811
that she said knows Julia.

53:40.960 --> 53:42.769
David, listen, this is
completely unacceptable.

53:42.920 --> 53:45.287
This is total negligence on her part.
I can't have it.

53:45.440 --> 53:46.441
Yeah, I got it.

53:46.680 --> 53:48.682
I understand how it looks.
It was an accident.

53:48.840 --> 53:50.842
It could have happened to any of us.
You know how she...

53:56.480 --> 54:01.327
Tessa said that she found Lily talking
to some guy she'd never met before.

54:02.360 --> 54:03.361
What guy?

54:03.520 --> 54:06.842
I don't know. All right, she seemed
to think that you knew him.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.321
She did? What did she say?

54:10.160 --> 54:11.446
I just wanna know if it's true.

54:12.320 --> 54:15.369
If what is true?
I don't know who she's talking about!

54:18.680 --> 54:19.727
Where's your ring, Julia?

54:20.200 --> 54:22.328
How come you haven't been wearing it?

54:25.040 --> 54:26.246
Nowhere.

54:28.320 --> 54:29.765
I took it off to take a bath the other day

54:29.920 --> 54:32.161
and I thought I knew
where I placed it. But...

54:32.320 --> 54:34.368
It's gotta be in the house, though.

54:34.520 --> 54:36.090
So, I've been looking for it.

54:36.240 --> 54:39.528
Why would you tell Tessa
that it's being cleaned then?

54:40.920 --> 54:42.251
I don't know! I...

54:42.880 --> 54:44.370
Why did she bring it up?

54:46.000 --> 54:47.206
Who sent you flowers?

54:51.680 --> 54:53.250
I don't know.

54:54.520 --> 54:56.807
I called to find out and ask and...

54:56.960 --> 54:58.883
It must have been a mistake.

55:01.000 --> 55:02.206
Look...

55:03.400 --> 55:06.529
I get that you're going through a rough time,

55:07.560 --> 55:09.847
that, uh, it's an adjustment period
or whatever.

55:10.000 --> 55:11.570
Maybe you even feel lost.

55:11.720 --> 55:12.721
Okay, I...

55:12.880 --> 55:15.486
I don't feel... Who said I feel lost?

55:16.080 --> 55:17.650
Did Tessa say that I feel lost?

55:17.800 --> 55:19.928
Because I don't feel lost.

55:20.080 --> 55:22.003
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the ring.

55:22.160 --> 55:24.731
I'm sorry about today.

55:36.600 --> 55:39.331
Tessa said she's not comfortable
having Lily in the house.

55:39.520 --> 55:40.726
What?

55:42.320 --> 55:45.005
She doesn't want you alone with Lily.

55:45.720 --> 55:46.926
David, that's ridiculous.

55:47.080 --> 55:49.287
Yeah, I know. I know, it's...

55:50.240 --> 55:52.447
I gotta let this blow over for a few days.

55:52.600 --> 55:55.365
I can't have her spiral
and open up the custody stuff.

55:57.600 --> 55:59.568
She's fucking with me.

56:02.880 --> 56:04.245
Julia, listen to me.

56:04.440 --> 56:05.441
Oh, my God.

56:05.600 --> 56:07.409
Tessa may be wound a little tight.

56:07.560 --> 56:10.404
Nobody knows that better than me.
Trust me, but...

56:11.200 --> 56:13.965
She is the mother of my daughter.

56:15.520 --> 56:17.761
She loves Lily more than anything

56:17.920 --> 56:20.890
and she found her wandering in a parking lot.

56:22.040 --> 56:24.611
Okay? That is where this is coming from.

56:27.880 --> 56:29.484
I know.

56:32.960 --> 56:34.564
I'll try harder.

56:34.800 --> 56:36.165
I'll just try harder.

56:36.320 --> 56:38.129
Yeah, I know you will.

56:39.400 --> 56:40.606
I know.

56:41.440 --> 56:43.761
Listen, I got some work to do.
I'm gonna go downstairs.

56:43.960 --> 56:45.962
I'll be back up in a bit.

57:02.760 --> 57:06.606
Lily, you see, the horse knows

57:06.760 --> 57:08.330
that you are not in control.

57:08.480 --> 57:11.927
If you act afraid, she has every right
to think that she's in charge.

57:12.120 --> 57:14.805
So, sit back. Find your seat.

57:15.360 --> 57:17.328
Take a deep breath.

57:17.520 --> 57:20.171
I drove a long way out here, my darling.

57:23.480 --> 57:24.481
Hi, Lily.

57:25.520 --> 57:26.521
Hi!

57:26.960 --> 57:28.007
What are you doing here?

57:28.160 --> 57:29.321
Where's David?

57:29.520 --> 57:31.124
David got stuck at work.
He'll be waiting for us at home.

57:31.840 --> 57:33.365
I hope so.

57:35.040 --> 57:37.281
So, how's it going?

57:37.520 --> 57:39.170
She's a beauty.

57:40.040 --> 57:41.530
I'm scared.

57:42.200 --> 57:43.281
Lily,

57:43.640 --> 57:46.689
you're just getting used
to riding a new horse. You're fine.

57:47.720 --> 57:48.960
I don't wanna ride her.

57:49.520 --> 57:51.727
You're not getting off this horse.

57:55.640 --> 57:57.165
She doesn't seem to feel safe.

57:57.560 --> 57:58.846
I'm sorry, who asked you?

57:59.440 --> 58:02.171
She's safer here than she is alone with you.

58:04.720 --> 58:06.006
You're ready?

58:10.320 --> 58:11.970
Lily, relax.

58:12.880 --> 58:14.006
Okay?

58:15.800 --> 58:18.041
Come on, Lily. It's Daddy's day.

58:18.200 --> 58:19.247
We're leaving.

58:27.080 --> 58:28.844
It's okay.

58:32.720 --> 58:33.801
Lily.

58:36.040 --> 58:38.327
Don't you get off this horse. What are you...

58:42.920 --> 58:44.490
David's gonna hear about this.

58:44.640 --> 58:45.801
I'm sure.

58:49.920 --> 58:51.524
That was beneath you.

59:05.080 --> 59:06.605
I'm gonna be in trouble.

59:10.160 --> 59:11.400
Me, too.

59:12.040 --> 59:13.121
Lily,

59:13.800 --> 59:17.247
I know what it's like to love someone
who isn't always nice to you.

59:17.520 --> 59:22.651
My dad had a way of making me feel
like everything was my fault.

59:23.520 --> 59:28.162
But I want you to know that you are
a very, very special little girl.

59:28.320 --> 59:30.641
And you didn't do anything wrong.

59:31.360 --> 59:32.361
Okay?

59:42.800 --> 59:45.690
Who was the man you were talking to
at the market the other day?

59:46.520 --> 59:47.521
What man?

59:51.800 --> 59:53.086
Never mind.

59:53.440 --> 59:56.284
- Yeah, well, technically it was our day.
- Yes.

59:56.440 --> 59:58.966
Technically, it is my day. But...

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.607
I can't find that damn watch you got me.

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:07.489
Maybe I just stay here tonight.

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:08.846
You know?

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.690
You could just cancel the babysitter...

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.126
I can stay with Lily.

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:13.361
No.

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:17.886
You should be at this dinner with me.

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:21.930
All my principal investors
are gonna be there.

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:24.281
Okay?

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:25.801
Okay.

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:33.802
But if it wasn't for you guys
here at this table,

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:36.531
Copper Mountain Brewery wouldn't be here.

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:40.364
So, from Miguel and I,
thank you very much and cheers.

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:44.320
- Cheers!
- To Copper Mountain. Yes. Cheers.

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:45.606
Congratulations.

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:48.801
Exactly right.

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:54.200
Oh, no, you should!

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:56.727
We had a three to four plan that we were...

01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:58.446
...really proud of David.

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:01.206
He and Miguel had a really
impressive return on investment,

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:03.362
considering the size of their operation.

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:05.889
- Oh, you're kidding me.
- That's unbelievable.

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:07.765
That's right!

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:15.282
When I first came back from New York,
it was kind of a culture shock.

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.524
What we had was more physical.

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:19.920
He's insatiable.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.604
Public places.

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:26.483
We couldn't get away from each other.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.841
I'm so happy that all of you
could come tonight.

01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:35.610
I just really appreciate it.

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:37.125
Well, we won't tell anybody you said that.

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.520
Excuse me for a moment.

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:40.364
- Of course.
- Thanks.

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:48.370
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:52.805
You wanna try some of this one?

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:13.204
Maybe I should go out first.

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:15.283
Yeah. Okay.

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:19.161
You wanna help me?

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.646
Guess I'll see you outside.

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:27.410
Yeah. Okay.

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:45.089
And do you think it was a good idea
not to listen to Mommy?

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:47.641
- No.
- Are you sorry?

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:49.087
Yes.

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:53.926
You only get one mother, Lily.

01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:59.450
I only want what is best for us.
Don't ever forget that.

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:05.322
Now if Julia insists on sending you home
with such tangled hair...

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:10.920
I'm sorry, sweetheart, we're going to
have to fix the problem once and for all.

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:46.961
You need me.

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:14.567
I just spoke with David. He's moments away.

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:20.561
Hi, Lily.

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:24.281
Lily.

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:28.803
Lily Connover, you get back here
and say a proper goodbye to me.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.001
What happened?

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:33.004
- There are lessons to be learned.
- That's some sort of punishment?

01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:35.083
No. It's a reality.
I couldn't keep up with your knots.

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:38.410
She thinks that's because of me?

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:41.245
Why are you doing this?

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.767
- I don't know what you mean.
- Yes, you do.

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.685
Okay, this is really difficult for everyone.

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:47.763
But it doesn't have to actually be this hard.

01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:50.163
I'm not doing anything, Julia.

01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:53.443
I am simply living my life with my family.

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.970
If you're having a hard time,
I suggest you look in the mirror.

01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:00.284
No. I know exactly what it is
that you are trying to do.

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:03.444
And I am not gonna let you put Lily
in the middle of this anymore.

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:06.440
Are you threatening me?

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:10.883
Yes. I'm fucking threatening you.

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:13.520
And if you keep this up, you will regret it.

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:15.803
Lily Bean, I'm home! Where are ya?

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:17.007
You're hurting me.

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:18.491
- And you're scaring me.
- Fine.

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:20.489
Why are you hurting me? Stop it, Julia!

01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:23.123
Stay away from me!

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:24.566
Tessa!

01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:28.527
Oh, my God.

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:30.484
Are you okay?

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.688
- Stay away from me.
- Tessa!

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.804
Tessa, what happened?

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:37.485
I don't know.

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:40.010
She just got so angry.

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:41.241
What?

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:43.201
Julia...

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:45.328
- I didn't!
- I don't know. Maybe it's my fault.

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:48.051
I'm just trying to protect our child.

01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:50.842
David, please, just take us home.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.240
Mommy!

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:56.046
It's okay, sweetheart. I'm okay.

01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:57.645
No, you need to go to the doctor. Come on.

01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:00.329
Hey. Hey, Mommy's gonna be okay.

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:02.084
Okay. You ready?

01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:03.844
Okay, nice and slow. Ready?

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.685
Okay, take it easy.
There you go, there you go.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.401
All right, let's go. All right.

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:13.207
Okay, take it easy. Just nice and slow.

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:14.526
Come on, Lily.

01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:17.401
Okay.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.206
Okay.

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:26.770
All right, easy.

01:09:14.439 --> 01:09:18.243
When I saw what she did to Lily,
yeah, I did, I got angry.

01:09:18.399 --> 01:09:21.085
I got in her face, I grabbed her arm,

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:22.765
but I did not push her.

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:27.129
And I think she might have
slipped on purpose.

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:31.770
Yeah, maybe the truth lies
somewhere in between.

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:39.370
Why would you believe the person
who gave up on you instead of me?

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:41.121
What does that mean?

01:09:41.319 --> 01:09:42.765
Tessa told me that she had an affair.

01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:44.809
And you never told me that.

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:47.051
Listen...

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:51.560
Because it's not why I left her.

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:55.127
I wanted to leave Tessa years before that.

01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:57.601
I stayed because of Lily.

01:09:58.320 --> 01:09:59.446
The affair...

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.803
The affair just confirmed things.

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:05.601
She said that you guys were trying to
get back together when you met me.

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:07.802
And that you were taking couples therapy.

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:09.246
Never.

01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:12.968
Never. Never were we trying to reconcile.

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:15.761
I've no idea why she would say
something like that.

01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:19.807
Because she's fucking crazy, David.
Why can't you see that?

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:28.969
I left her.

01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:33.171
I left her, okay?

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:36.809
And I am sitting here, across from you,

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.650
and I wanna marry you

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:42.202
and I really don't wanna spend
the rest of my life

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:44.681
playing "she said, she said."

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:48.164
Julia, I am tired of all of this.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.446
I'm done with crazy.

01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:54.124
It's not good for us

01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:56.169
and it is not good for Lily.

01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:00.521
Then I need you to tell her that.

01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:04.009
Please talk to her.

01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:11.690
When I get back, I'll talk to her
about what she did to Lily.

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:17.043
And we'll talk more about this, too,
in a couple days.

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:18.926
Thank you.

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:31.484
Oh, my God, Jules, it's so late.
Are you okay?

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:32.886
Al, I need your help.

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:35.561
I need you to come here right away.

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:37.726
Done. Um...

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:39.844
I'll be on the first flight out
in the morning.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.161
All right.

01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:45.441
Okay, I broke this up into
school records and health records.

01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:47.366
Okay.

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:48.851
Thank you, Jamal.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.570
I can't believe he found all this for me.

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:53.451
Yeah. It turns out keeping
a convicted criminal hacker on payroll

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:55.204
actually comes in pretty handy.

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:56.771
There's more printing.

01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:58.763
All I could find was like,

01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:02.362
sorority princess,
perfect, perfect, perfect...

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:06.525
"Tessa Manning, request to seal
juvenile court record of a minor"?

01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:09.564
Okay, well there's gotta be
criminal records then.

01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:20.284
- "Child Services psychiatric report."
- Whoa.

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.769
"Tessa Manning, age 16,

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:25.082
"when her father left her mother
and moved in with his secretary,

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:26.605
"Tessa became destabilized,

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:31.243
"exhibiting obsessive, negative
and occasional violent behaviors."

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:36.083
She set fire to their house.

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:37.931
To whose house?

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:40.602
Uh, the father's house,
while they were still inside.

01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:42.762
Holy shit. Did they die?

01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:45.406
- No, no, no. It says no one was hurt.
- Oh.

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:47.130
"Father did not press charges.

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:49.806
"Mother, Helen Manning,
declined the recommended

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:52.406
"psychiatric care and family therapy."

01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:55.126
Okay. Um...

01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:58.288
I feel like I've been pretty cool
about this whole thing.

01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:02.126
Like, you wanted to move down here,
I said, "Go for it. YOLO."

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:06.649
He's got a weird ex? Who doesn't, right?
I'm someone's weird ex.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.288
But psycho Barbie setting fire to houses
with people inside, that's...

01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:13.128
This is where I draw the line.
We should go home.

01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:15.482
You can come home with me tonight,
I can't let you stay here.

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:17.005
No, Al.

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:20.522
I finally have proof,
and I need to show this to David.

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:27.124
Okay, she is dangerous and she needs
to stay away from all of us from now on.

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:30.648
She can't pretend like
I'm the one that's crazy anymore.

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:35.284
Enough is enough.

01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:38.526
Okay.

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:57.406
David?

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:01.841
Are you home early?

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:20.330
Hey, baby.

01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:23.886
You look great.

01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:28.045
My husband's coming.

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:29.406
Where are you going?

01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:32.566
He's coming home any minute now.

01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:35.371
Okay. We'll hurry then. It's okay.

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:37.890
Let go of me, Michael.

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:41.246
Okay.

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:48.365
Yeah, if you...

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:52.883
If you go now, I won't call the police, okay?

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:55.451
- Help!
- Hey!

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:00.406
The police?

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:02.409
What kind of sick fucking game is this?

01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:03.965
You asked me to come.

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:07.483
Oh, my God, she sent you here!

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:09.247
No more games.

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:12.331
Calm down. I'll let you go now.

01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:14.562
- I'm calm!
- All right? All right.

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:32.129
I'm sorry.

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:34.448
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:36.449
All right? What the fuck?

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:40.250
It's all right.

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:41.801
Okay.

01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:43.450
Fuck!

01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:59.041
Help, you gotta help me.

01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:00.561
You gotta help me.

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:04.520
You've handled this very poorly.

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:06.006
Who the fuck are you?

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:08.051
No, no, no! Argh!

01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:15.889
It was you.

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:20.042
You did this. You...

01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:40.161
I haven't done any of this.

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:43.801
Tessa Connover, um,

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.767
she was the one behind all of this.

01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:52.244
Your fiancÃ©'s ex-wife sets up
a fake Facebook account,

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:55.131
lures your abusive ex here

01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:57.408
and then kills him for no reason?

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:01.767
You see what this looks like, right?

01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:09.165
I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I just...

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:10.810
It's okay.

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:16.249
I was ashamed.

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:18.607
You know, I just...

01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:23.490
I never wanted you to see me like this.

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:25.649
- Hey. Hey.
- Or think of me like this.

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:28.371
You know, like you're always saying
how strong I am.

01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:29.521
You are.

01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:31.921
I wanted you to always think of me like that.

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:34.327
I'm not that person anymore.

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:37.042
I'm not that person anymore.

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:40.647
I just never wanted you to see me
like this or think of me like this.

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:43.326
- I don't want you to pity me, you know.
- Shh.

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:46.691
I thought maybe you wouldn't want me anymore.

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:48.291
Come here.

01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:51.166
Listen to me.

01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:56.361
Nothing matters but you and I.

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:03.043
We're gonna be okay.

01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:04.681
Promise?

01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:07.645
I wanna put this behind us. I promise.

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:09.685
You trust me?

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:12.361
Okay.

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:16.526
I love you so much.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.809
Mr. Connover?

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.571
- Detective Pope still needs to see you.
- But...

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:26.328
Seems the, uh, meeting
which she initiated went awry.

01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:28.642
Look at the last page.

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:41.925
You recognize this?

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:47.050
Yeah. It's my watch.

01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:51.367
I just don't understand
how any of this can be happening.

01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:52.931
That doesn't make sense.

01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:55.003
We'll check out the story
and get to the truth.

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:57.129
I still have a few questions to ask her.

01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:00.729
Go see your kid. You have a lot to deal with.

01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:06.604
I couldn't have killed him.

01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:09.290
Did I hit something in his leg?

01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:12.251
Miss Banks, the guy was stabbed in his heart.

01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:14.761
He didn't stand a chance.

01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:15.967
The DA called.

01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:19.920
Since the evidence is circumstantial,
I'm gonna have to let you go.

01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:21.764
But the investigation is ongoing.

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:25.929
You're required to stay within a 10-mile
radius and your phone stays here as evidence.

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:29.120
Where is my fiancÃ©?

01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:31.130
He's waiting for me.

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:34.643
I'm sorry, I had to show him the file.

01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:39.331
He went home to be with his daughter.

01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:13.848
David. You're home.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.650
- I need to see Lily.
- Of course.

01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:17.609
You're her father.

01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:56.731
Hey, it's David. Leave a message.

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:04.601
David.

01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:25.930
Oh, my God.

01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:43.562
It should've been mine.

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:47.051
She didn't even know your grandmother.

01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:50.524
- Julia was right.
- No.

01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:54.366
No, no, no. This is not my fault.

01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:56.562
This is her fault.

01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:01.442
You should never have brought her here.

01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:18.045
I made one mistake.

01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:21.289
And you took everything away from me.

01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:22.601
Stop.

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:25.885
And gave it all to her!

01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:28.321
Right in front of me!

01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:32.243
This is my life, David. It's mine!

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:33.481
Tessa!

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.526
I'm gonna get you help.

01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:42.367
And I'm taking Lily home.

01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:53.283
This is your home.

01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:02.485
David?

01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:11.046
I'll take care of you.

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:13.205
It's okay.

01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:46.047
David. David.

01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:49.886
David?

01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:55.566
Lily...

01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:57.561
Okay.

01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:01.290
I'll be right back, I promise.

01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:26.481
Lily.

01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:28.210
I'm gonna carry you to my car.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.809
And I want you to stay there,

01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:34.328
go back to sleep with your blankie
and Mr. Weasel. Can you do that?

01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:36.969
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:39.248
- Then can we go to our house?
- Yes.

01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:41.921
Then we can go back to our house.

01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:43.286
All right.

01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:09.205
911 emergency.

01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:18.244
We have to get David help.

01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:23.242
He's hurt, Tessa.

01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:30.485
This is my house!

01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:35.089
You're right. It's your house.

01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:49.411
You're a joke.

01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:52.960
You can't do anything right, can you, Julia?

01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:55.604
Even Michael.

01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:59.082
After everything he did to you,
you just let him get away.

01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:00.730
Again.

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:04.245
You're pathetic.

01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:09.807
How do you expect to be a mother
when you can't even take care of yourself?

01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:12.689
You're worthless, Julia.

01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:16.848
You will always be worthless.

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:20.007
No.

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:21.720
Not this time.

01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:29.521
You will never have what's mine!

01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:33.008
You will never have David!

01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:35.208
It's not about him!

01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:38.486
It's never been about him and you know it!

01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:41.767
He left you two years ago!

01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:47.766
I want my life.

01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:49.600
Not yours.

01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:57.806
David.

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:07.007
Help me, David.

01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:15.441
Stop.

01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:17.805
Stop. Stop.

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:19.765
Tessa.

01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:24.322
Look at yourself. See.

01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:28.290
You're doing this, but you can stop.

01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:31.202
Please stop.

01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:41.526
Why do you always ruin everything?

01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:04.368
Stay back. Stay back.

01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:35.726
Julia, please.

01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:37.881
Don't...

01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:42.769
Don't let Lily remember me like this.

01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:00.286
David.

01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:08.801
David.

01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:11.090
Oh, my God.

01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:13.081
Hey.

01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:16.243
- Hey.
- Julia.

01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:18.683
I'm so sorry.

01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:21.722
I'm sorry.

01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:24.603
Please forgive me.

01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:27.127
We're okay. We're gonna be okay.

01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:32.407
I'm gonna make this up to you.

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:35.203
I promise.

01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:38.364
I love you, Julia.

01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:44.322
I love you, too.

01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:52.044
Leave that clear for the ME.

01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:54.362
And we'll do everything we can for you.

01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:55.925
I'm very sorry.

01:33:56.120 --> 01:33:58.771
I'll, uh, see you at the hospital.

01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:01.725
Miss Banks?

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:04.449
Julia!

01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:28.367
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:30.568
- How's it going?
- Are you guys gonna head straight...

01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:44.127
Ali.

01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:53.806
Hi, um, Lily. Hi, good morning.

01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:55.121
Oh!

01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:57.001
Can you, uh, touch my nose?

01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:59.766
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Connover.

01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:01.811
Hello!

01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:03.650
Hi, Humphrey, hi, hello.

01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:06.770
I'm gonna pet you later
'cause I need coffee desperately.

01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:09.207
I am very hungover from the wedding.

01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:11.249
Hi.

01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:12.526
I think your front doorbell's broken.

01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:14.603
Yeah, well, that and about
10,000 other things.

01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:16.603
The longest to-do list in history.

01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:20.128
I love this house.
And my room and San Francisco.

01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:22.762
- They have the best donuts ever.
- Yeah.

01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:24.610
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:27.764
No. Thank you for your gift, by the way.

01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:29.206
You're welcome.

01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:34.846
- I'll get it.
- Okay.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.651
It's probably another scary urban squirrel.

01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:48.331
Humphrey, there's nobody here. Look.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.128
Hello, Julia.

01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:56.803
I'm here to see my granddaughter.

01:36:58.120 --> 01:36:59.326
She's here! Lovey's here!

01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:00.561
Oh.

01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:03.403
My darling girl.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.445
You're here.

01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:07.925
Yes.

01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:10.882
I'm here.
