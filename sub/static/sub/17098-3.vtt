And according to
one of your colleagues,

07:59.250 --> 08:02.959
they say you used your hands
to anally penetrate...

-No. No, I wouldn't.

08:09.208 --> 08:10.667

coming from?

He's requested that his name,
or she, her name,

08:14.333 --> 08:16.166
or his, remain anonymous.

08:16.208 --> 08:18.458
But this is
a very serious complaint.

08:18.500 --> 08:19.792
I think I know
what this is about.

08:19.834 --> 08:21.667
And it's just
a huge misunderstanding.

08:21.709 --> 08:23.500
I'm sure it is.
I made it very clear

08:23.542 --> 08:26.959

sexually inappropriate with me

08:27.000 --> 08:28.417
or anybody else,

08:28.458 --> 08:30.125
and I am very aware of
that kind of thing.

08:30.166 --> 08:32.250
It's called a<i> ddongjeem.</i>

08:32.291 --> 08:34.542
-Is that prison slang?
-No, it's Korean.

08:34.875 --> 08:38.625
So<i> ddong</i> means "poop",
and<i> jeem</i> means, uh, "needle".

08:39.208 --> 08:40.500
So, like a "poop needle."

08:41.959 --> 08:43.250
It's the same as a wedgie.

08:43.291 --> 08:45.500
Okay, uh,
I'm picturing a wedgie

08:45.542 --> 08:47.583
but I feel like you would
have to work very hard

08:47.625 --> 08:50.125
to get to the point
of penetration.

08:50.166 --> 08:51.583
There's no penetration.

08:51.625 --> 08:53.709
It's just a prank that
Korean kids like to do.

08:53.750 --> 08:55.792
Okay? You put your hands
in the prayer position...

08:55.834 --> 08:57.875
So this is a religious thing?

08:57.917 --> 08:59.208
No, it's just how
you put your hands.

08:59.250 --> 09:02.333
And then you just give
a quick jab. For fun.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.083
So you jab the anus for fun.

09:04.125 --> 09:06.000
It's got nothing to do
with the anus. Okay?

09:06.041 --> 09:07.166
Just forget about the anus.

09:07.208 --> 09:08.834
I'd like to,
but you keep saying "anus."

09:08.875 --> 09:10.542
It's just a quick little
poke in the bum

09:10.583 --> 09:13.208
that Korean guys do
to each other, like at church.

09:13.250 --> 09:14.792
I'm not explaining this right.

09:15.166 --> 09:16.792
Okay, you know what?

09:16.834 --> 09:19.500
I think I get it and
it even sounds kind of fun.

09:19.542 --> 09:21.041
But if this got back
to head office

09:21.083 --> 09:22.667
it could be considered
harassment.

09:22.709 --> 09:23.959
Head office knows about this?

09:24.041 --> 09:26.125
No, but if Kimchee, or her...

09:26.166 --> 09:27.834
Decides to file
a formal complaint

09:27.875 --> 09:29.583
I have no choice
but to send this on up.

09:29.625 --> 09:31.458
Kimchee<i> ddongjeems</i> me
all the time.

09:31.500 --> 09:34.458
Okay. So this is more
widespread than I thought.

09:34.500 --> 09:37.083
I need you to go find Kimchee
and resolve this now.

09:39.166 --> 09:40.458
Without using<i> ddongjeem,</i>

09:40.500 --> 09:43.125
or anything else that might be
sexually confusing

09:43.166 --> 09:45.750
or ambiguous
or intriguing at all.

-See?

is too full.

10:07.250 --> 10:10.250
No balance.
Have to take one away.

10:10.291 --> 10:11.542
Yeah.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.875
-Uh... Take out.
-Yeah.

10:16.250 --> 10:17.834
But that's the one I...

10:18.542 --> 10:19.583
Took.

(EXCLAIMS)

10:23.667 --> 10:25.875

-Hmm? (CHUCKLES)
-Hmm.

10:27.500 --> 10:30.625
-Yeah. You remember
Mr. Chang's funeral photo?
-Very bad.

10:30.667 --> 10:33.625
Photo was from
roller-coaster ride at
Canada Wonderland.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.166

-Hmm.

10:53.917 --> 10:56.125
You want help getting
that ice pack up
a little further?

10:56.166 --> 10:57.917
I wouldn't joke
about this, bro.

10:57.959 --> 10:59.417
Kimch, you're not serious...

10:59.458 --> 11:01.125
This is a really
interesting pamphlet.

11:02.417 --> 11:03.917
I could get fired for this.

11:04.041 --> 11:06.208
Maybe you should have
thought of that before you...

11:06.583 --> 11:09.583
"Repeatedly tried to force
your hands on me
without consent..."

11:09.625 --> 11:11.250
It was just a<i> ddongjeem!</i>

11:12.417 --> 11:14.500
Please,
don't<i> ddongjeem</i> me again!

11:14.959 --> 11:20.792
I really don't need any more
"anxiety, loss of appetite,
or social isolation."

11:20.834 --> 11:22.625
(CHUCKLES)
He's not being serious.

11:22.667 --> 11:24.583
And he does it to me
all the time.

11:24.625 --> 11:25.959
It's just a little nudge
with your fingers in...

11:26.000 --> 11:28.875
It's like if I gave you
a wedgie or a pink belly.

11:28.917 --> 11:34.417
Which I would never do,
but if I did, which I wouldn't,
then it would just be for fun.

11:52.875 --> 11:53.959
No.

11:55.458 --> 11:57.500
Are you mad generally?

11:57.750 --> 11:58.542
No.

11:59.792 --> 12:03.542
Well, kinda. Sorta. Yes.

12:04.041 --> 12:05.250
Okay.

12:07.166 --> 12:10.250
I'm just thinking
I've been focusing too much
on photography, you know?

12:11.208 --> 12:13.583
You're a way better
photographer than I am.

12:13.875 --> 12:15.417
Apparently not.

Okay, let's do this one, huh?

GERALD: Hi, Mr. Kim.

12:20.083 --> 12:21.291
Are you wearing makeup?

It's a Korean-style lotion.

12:25.208 --> 12:26.959
For Gerald take my picture.
Hmm?

12:27.083 --> 12:29.959
What you think,
with golf trophy?

12:30.000 --> 12:30.959
Church tournament, huh?

12:31.291 --> 12:32.458
Or we go outside.

12:32.500 --> 12:33.792
I show you my putt.

12:34.041 --> 12:35.458
I hope that bag of chips
is worth it.

12:35.500 --> 12:37.625
Ah, not just bag of chip.

12:37.875 --> 12:41.792
One bag of chip every day
for rest of my life.

12:42.041 --> 12:43.625
I thought it was
for the rest of my life?

12:43.667 --> 12:46.166
No, I say "rest of life."

12:46.208 --> 12:49.083
You life, me life,
whichever end first, mmm?

12:49.625 --> 12:52.750
-Well...
-If I die first,
how I give chip to you?

12:52.792 --> 12:56.083
Huh? And if you die first,
how you eat chip
I give to you?

12:56.125 --> 12:57.750
Just take picture.

12:58.709 --> 13:00.959
Thank you all for coming
to this little meeting.

13:01.333 --> 13:03.417
-You said it was mandatory.
-Okay.

13:03.542 --> 13:07.417
I think we've all noticed
a little bit of tension
around the office lately,

13:07.458 --> 13:11.750
so I just wanted
to get the gang together
and nip this in the bud.

13:12.417 --> 13:14.458
A lot of people
mispronounce that word.

13:14.500 --> 13:15.917
Sorry, what is this about?

13:15.959 --> 13:18.792
Well, I like to think of us
as a family and, Terence,

13:18.834 --> 13:22.166
two of your siblings
are having a little bit of
a misunderstanding.

13:22.208 --> 13:24.041
Oh, I just thought
this was a lovers' quarrel.

13:24.083 --> 13:25.250
We're not a couple.

13:25.291 --> 13:26.834
-You're... You're not?
-No.

13:26.875 --> 13:29.291
Okay, it's just a<i> ddongjeem.</i>
It's a Korean thing.

13:29.333 --> 13:33.208
And this is an excellent
opportunity for us
to increase our sensitivity

13:33.250 --> 13:36.041
of different cultures
and traditions.

13:36.333 --> 13:40.083
For example, in my family
we play this game
where we pass an orange

13:40.125 --> 13:42.834
around the room
using only our necks.
(CHUCKLES)

13:43.959 --> 13:48.333
That may seem sexual
to some people
in different cultures...

13:48.375 --> 13:49.959
Why are you looking at me?

13:50.000 --> 13:51.875
There are only
five people here.
I have to look at someone.

13:51.917 --> 13:55.458
The point is, we need to be
sensitive to each other
racially, and sexually,

13:55.500 --> 13:58.500
and culturally,
and sexually...

13:59.000 --> 14:01.291
And if you two
can just make amends,
we can all move on.

14:01.333 --> 14:04.333
Sure. I'm really sorry
about what happened.

14:04.375 --> 14:06.709
Totally unprofessional,
totally won't happen again.

14:06.750 --> 14:08.709
Thank you.
I accept your apology.

14:08.750 --> 14:10.125
Uh, I wasn't
apologizing to you.

14:10.166 --> 14:11.750
I was apologizing
to everyone else.

14:11.792 --> 14:13.458
Oh. Apology not accepted.

14:13.500 --> 14:15.041
You can't accept an apology
that I never gave.

14:15.083 --> 14:17.709
-Maybe you guys
should just break up.
-We're not a couple.

14:17.750 --> 14:21.291
But I'm sure as friends
you'd like to find some
common ground.

14:21.333 --> 14:22.667
Oh, we're not friends.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.750
-We're not?
-No, we're not.

14:26.625 --> 14:29.875
Okay, this might be
a good time for
a little break.

-JUNG: Fine.
-Cool. Good meeting.

14:31.750 --> 14:34.083
-I'm just gonna go.
-Okay, thank you for coming.

14:34.125 --> 14:35.709
-Yeah, Terence, you can go.
-I can go too?

what you're going for,

14:45.333 --> 14:48.166
and I'll tell you how you can
sort of achieve that look.

14:48.208 --> 14:52.041
Hmm. In my funeral photo
I want to be looking
successful.

14:52.083 --> 14:55.041
But why are you
making that face?

14:55.291 --> 14:58.166
This is a successful face.
Why you making that face?

14:58.834 --> 15:00.458
This is just my face.

I'm here, okay? Both of us.

some work or something.

-Turn off camera.

-You don't look sorry.

15:49.083 --> 15:51.667
-Do I look successful?
-You look uncomfortable.

15:51.709 --> 15:52.917
You look uncomfortable.

15:53.792 --> 15:56.500
-Get some chocolate milk.
-(SIGHS)

15:57.250 --> 15:58.625
Don't use that one.

15:59.208 --> 16:01.333
Maybe we should try this
another day.

16:01.375 --> 16:02.417
What?

16:02.667 --> 16:05.333
I get nervous around you.

16:06.250 --> 16:08.041
And you nervous
make me nervous.

16:08.333 --> 16:10.500
Can't take good funeral photo.

16:30.458 --> 16:33.000
Yeah.
Yeah, I think I understand.

I should be sleeping.

16:46.917 --> 16:48.667

no problem.

16:49.667 --> 16:52.375
-We're really gonna
do this now?
-Do what?

16:52.417 --> 16:53.583
'Cause I don't know
what we're doing.

16:54.875 --> 16:56.542
All right.
What do you want me to say?

16:56.583 --> 16:57.875
Anything!

16:59.542 --> 17:01.333
I find out today
we're not friends anymore,
and then I get home,

17:01.375 --> 17:03.709
and this guy doesn't say
anything to me.

17:03.750 --> 17:05.792
You make dinner, watch TV,
and go to bed.

17:05.834 --> 17:08.500
-What is that?
-You're the one who said
we weren't friends anymore.

17:08.750 --> 17:11.291
-Is that all you got?
-It's what happened!

17:11.333 --> 17:13.291
So you didn't brutally
<i>ddongjeem</i> me?

17:13.625 --> 17:15.417
And then kick me
out of our office?

17:15.917 --> 17:20.208
And then you had the balls
to apologize to everyone else
but me!

17:20.250 --> 17:23.208
Speaking of balls,
you might want to
switch to boxer briefs.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.959
You're seriously
making jokes right now?

17:25.000 --> 17:26.667
You know what?
Forget it.

17:26.709 --> 17:29.041
Hey. Hold it, Kimch.

17:30.333 --> 17:31.667
I'm sorry.

17:32.583 --> 17:34.667
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

17:34.709 --> 17:37.542
Yeah, I want you
to feel better.
But I mean it.

17:38.375 --> 17:39.583
Okay? This sucks.

17:40.667 --> 17:42.333
I shouldn't have
<i>ddongjeem-ed</i> you at work.

17:42.375 --> 17:43.500
And?

17:43.542 --> 17:45.417
What about kicking me
out of my office?

17:45.458 --> 17:46.625
It's my office.

17:46.875 --> 17:48.083
It's my apartment.

17:48.542 --> 17:49.500
Are you kicking me out?

17:49.750 --> 17:51.000
No.

17:51.667 --> 17:53.458
It's just so weird.

17:56.333 --> 17:58.458
Look, it's weird for me too.

17:58.875 --> 18:01.750
But when we're at work
you gotta respect my position.

18:03.291 --> 18:06.750
And you gotta respect me.
All of me.

18:09.709 --> 18:11.000
You're right.

18:13.458 --> 18:14.417
Hug it out?

18:16.375 --> 18:18.709
-You're not wearing any...
-Hug it out.

18:18.750 --> 18:21.417
I'm really not comfortable...
Oh!

18:21.458 --> 18:22.583
Okay.

18:24.125 --> 18:25.458
You hungry?

18:25.500 --> 18:26.625
For what?

18:26.667 --> 18:28.250
I'm making eggs.

18:28.291 --> 18:31.458
(SIGHS) I'm just gonna
close my eyes and
go back to sleep.

18:31.500 --> 18:33.583
All right. (KISSES)

any bouillon cubes, do you?

Here you go, sir.

19:02.875 --> 19:04.208
Thanks.

19:09.959 --> 19:11.166
You know what?

19:11.417 --> 19:12.709
We're good.

19:13.792 --> 19:15.208
C'mon, Noah.

19:19.291 --> 19:21.375
(WHISPERS) Go.
You blocking my light.

19:22.625 --> 19:23.917
Gerald!

19:24.583 --> 19:25.709
Time out!

-Who are you yelling at, Appa?
-Gerald.

19:28.375 --> 19:30.583
He is taking
sneak-attack photo of me.

19:30.625 --> 19:32.750
-But I need break.
-Gerald's at school.

19:32.792 --> 19:36.291
That's what he wants us
to think. Gerald!

19:36.333 --> 19:38.417
No, seriously, Appa.
I was just with him.

19:38.834 --> 19:41.166
Ugh, waste.

19:41.542 --> 19:43.166
Such good posing today.

19:43.208 --> 19:46.583
Why don't you just sit,
and I'll get you some tea.

19:46.834 --> 19:49.417
(SIGHS) Okay.

19:54.291 --> 19:55.291
(GROANS)

19:56.834 --> 19:58.250
(APPA EXHALES DEEPLY)

19:59.667 --> 20:00.667
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

20:01.792 --> 20:03.041
APPA: Yeah.

20:03.542 --> 20:05.333
What I tell you, Gerald?
Sneak attack.

20:05.375 --> 20:08.750
-Catch the inside Appa.
-You have great talent.

20:08.792 --> 20:11.417
Thank you, Mrs. Kim.
I'm glad you like it.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.542
Side by side.

20:14.583 --> 20:16.875
-Like graveyard when we die.
-Mmm.

20:17.625 --> 20:19.208
(WHISPERS)
Thanks for the save.

20:19.250 --> 20:20.792
I feel like you should
just tell them.

20:20.834 --> 20:23.375
(WHISPERS) Nah,
this is working for me.

20:24.875 --> 20:27.959
-Now I ready to die.
-Me too.

20:29.333 --> 20:31.834
-Look like we going to heaven.
-UMMA: Yeah.

20:33.542 --> 20:35.542
I feel like
I shouldn't be here.

20:35.583 --> 20:37.417
(WHISPERS) I feel like that
most of the time.

20:48.458 --> 20:49.917
(VACUUM CLEANER WHIRRING)

20:52.625 --> 20:54.291
Are you a good photographer?

20:54.333 --> 20:55.875
I don't know.
I like some of my stuff.

20:55.917 --> 20:58.291
-Come on, Janet.
-Yeah, I'm pretty good.

20:58.333 --> 21:01.000
Well, then then
it doesn't matter
what Appa and Umma think.

21:01.041 --> 21:04.375
(LAUGHS) Oh. I'm going to
remember you said that.

21:06.667 --> 21:08.208
This must be killing you.

21:08.250 --> 21:09.917
<i>Ddongjeem's</i> stupid.
It's for kids.

21:09.959 --> 21:12.417
Uh-huh. And you'll get fired
if you do it again.

21:12.709 --> 21:13.792
Yeah.

21:14.542 --> 21:16.000
But I don't work here.

21:18.583 --> 21:20.959
If anyone asks,
I'm in my office.

21:21.583 --> 21:22.792
Hey.

21:23.500 --> 21:24.458
Gun it.
