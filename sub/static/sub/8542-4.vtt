WEBVTT

00:03.220 --> 00:05.179
You take the south side.
I'll take north.

00:05.266 --> 00:07.703
You met the new boss yet?
I heard he's young.

00:07.790 --> 00:09.966
Watch for any potential
threats to the mayor.

00:10.053 --> 00:12.273
Younger than us, and he's got
limited field experience.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.797
[Lisbon]
'Mayor just left the building.
The march is underway.'

00:14.884 --> 00:16.451
Copy that.
Moving into position.

00:16.538 --> 00:19.062
Doesn't it bother you, working
with a barely qualified guy?

00:19.149 --> 00:21.456
You get used to it.

00:21.543 --> 00:24.763
[woman screams]
I've got an unknown disturbance
in the northeast alley.

00:24.850 --> 00:26.200
- Excuse me. Police.
- CBI.

00:26.287 --> 00:27.897
- Coming through.
- Excuse me.

00:31.509 --> 00:33.946
- You see what happened?
- No. Lo vi en el suelo.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.688
Anybody see what happened?
Alguien vio lo que paso?

00:36.775 --> 00:38.995
Okay, I need for you
to secure the alley.

00:39.082 --> 00:41.519
Get backup in here now. Contact
the mayor's security detail.

00:41.606 --> 00:43.478
Clear these people out now.

00:44.783 --> 00:46.220
He's dead.

00:46.307 --> 00:48.657
- 'Excuse me.'
- 'Excuse me. Watch out.'

00:50.137 --> 00:51.399
What do we got?

00:51.486 --> 00:52.791
Homicide.
Multiple stab wounds.

00:52.878 --> 00:55.316
- Any ID?
- No wallet, nothing I can see.

00:55.403 --> 00:57.796
Got a large transient
population. Could be a robbery.

00:57.883 --> 01:00.190
- Inform the office.
- Sure.

01:00.277 --> 01:02.366
Jane.

01:02.453 --> 01:05.195
[indistinct shouting]
Speak up, Lisbon.
It's a little loud here.

01:05.282 --> 01:07.415
- Are you close to us?
- Well, that depends.

01:07.502 --> 01:08.938
Are you still on crowd patrol?

01:09.025 --> 01:10.635
No. We got a homicide now.

01:10.722 --> 01:13.943
Then I'm close.

01:14.030 --> 01:16.772
[indistinct shouting]

01:21.255 --> 01:24.084
[distorted indistinct shouting]

01:44.060 --> 01:45.844
[indistinct conversations]

01:46.889 --> 01:48.934
[siren wailing]

01:49.021 --> 01:50.936
[Lisbon]
'Hey, Jane!'

01:51.023 --> 01:53.722
Strange time for murder. In
the middle of a protest march?

01:53.809 --> 01:55.985
Leave it to a killer to do
something crazy.

01:56.072 --> 01:58.814
Or calculated.

01:58.901 --> 02:00.207
Notice how this alleyway

02:00.294 --> 02:02.600
is starting to look like
a policeman's ball?

02:02.687 --> 02:05.777
If I wanted to use a bullet
to express my displeasure

02:05.864 --> 02:08.476
with the mayor's politics,
I'd clear out the heat.

02:08.563 --> 02:10.304
You think this murder
is a decoy?

02:10.391 --> 02:12.088
No clue, but there's
a suspicious-looking man

02:12.175 --> 02:13.872
on "J" street and 56th.

02:13.959 --> 02:17.354
Haunted eyes, nervous energy,
an overcoat on a hot day.

02:17.441 --> 02:19.182
That's thin, even for you.

02:19.269 --> 02:21.706
Yeah, you're probably right.

02:21.793 --> 02:24.579
It's only the mayor's life
at stake. Forget I spoke.

02:29.018 --> 02:29.975
Cho.

02:31.412 --> 02:33.414
[indistinct conversations]

02:33.501 --> 02:35.894
[chanting in Spanish]

02:48.690 --> 02:49.908
We got him.
Southeast corner.

02:49.995 --> 02:52.781
[chanting in Spanish continues]

02:57.786 --> 03:00.484
CBI. Put your hands
where I can see 'em.

03:00.571 --> 03:03.574
Do me a favor and step
over here with me.

03:03.661 --> 03:05.663
What's the problem, ma'am?
I didn't do anything.

03:05.750 --> 03:08.449
Then you won't mind
if we search you.

03:08.536 --> 03:10.233
Hands on your head,
interlace your fingers.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.756
Turn around
and face the wall.

03:11.843 --> 03:13.193
[chanting in Spanish continues]

03:16.196 --> 03:17.806
Gun.

03:17.893 --> 03:19.503
A semiautomatic .45.

03:19.590 --> 03:21.723
[clicks]
Fully loaded.

03:21.810 --> 03:23.638
[click]

03:23.725 --> 03:25.814
Chambered round.

03:25.901 --> 03:27.468
I can explain that.

03:27.555 --> 03:29.426
Station's right around
the corner. Turn around.

03:29.513 --> 03:30.427
[handcuffs click]

03:33.169 --> 03:34.126
Come on.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.216
[chanting in Spanish continues]

03:38.957 --> 03:40.307
[theme music]

03:50.882 --> 03:54.408
That's a concealed carry license
and that's my name. Henry Tibbs.

03:54.495 --> 03:57.324
Gives me authority to carry my
sidearm anywhere in California.

03:57.411 --> 03:58.977
These aren't easy
to come by.

03:59.064 --> 04:00.979
You had to demonstrate
a need to carry.

04:01.066 --> 04:03.112
I'm a Texas man.

04:03.199 --> 04:04.679
That's my need.

04:04.766 --> 04:07.072
Met a local sheriff
who sympathized.

04:07.159 --> 04:08.422
Hook 'em horns.

04:08.509 --> 04:10.032
Why were you standing there

04:10.119 --> 04:11.425
with your legal
concealed sidearm?

04:11.512 --> 04:14.428
I was, uh, downtown,
dropping off resumes.

04:14.515 --> 04:16.908
I'm, uh, an insurance salesman.

04:16.995 --> 04:18.649
I've been out of work.

04:18.736 --> 04:21.304
The economy's tighter
than bark on a tree.

04:21.391 --> 04:23.654
You always go job hunting
with a loaded gun?

04:23.741 --> 04:26.831
There were several hundred
angry protesters on that street.

04:26.918 --> 04:29.921
And you put yourself
right in the middle of 'em.

04:30.008 --> 04:33.360
Sure. It's not every day
you get to see a big-city mayor.

04:34.361 --> 04:35.666
[Cho]
'Or shoot him.'

04:35.753 --> 04:38.147
Henry Tibbs.
Clean record, no priors.

04:38.234 --> 04:39.757
Gun permit checks out.

04:39.844 --> 04:41.846
Says here
he's on unemployment

04:41.933 --> 04:43.631
owns a home
with his wife Linda

04:43.718 --> 04:45.110
but they're behind
on payments.

04:45.197 --> 04:48.157
And the sun came up
just to hear him crow

04:48.244 --> 04:49.637
as they say in Texas.

04:49.724 --> 04:51.421
Do we have anything
that connects Tibbs

04:51.508 --> 04:53.249
to our John Doe
in the alley?

04:53.336 --> 04:55.033
Not yet. Forensics swabbed him
for bloodstains.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.121
Couldn't find anything.

04:56.208 --> 04:58.298
I don't like what I'm hearing.

04:58.385 --> 05:00.561
Police put out an alert
for a hate crime

05:00.648 --> 05:03.955
so we rounded up
the nearest white guy.

05:04.042 --> 05:06.262
And while that's a refreshing
twist on racial profiling

05:06.349 --> 05:08.656
Mr. Tibbs has himself
grounds for a lawsuit.

05:08.743 --> 05:11.398
We should let him go
and send his wife some flowers.

05:13.704 --> 05:16.968
Special agent Luther Wainright.
I'm your new boss.

05:17.055 --> 05:19.057
Welcome aboard.
I'm Agent Lisbon.

05:19.144 --> 05:20.581
Agent Lisbon,
nice to meet you.

05:20.668 --> 05:22.147
- This is Agent Rig--
- Agent Rigsby.

05:22.234 --> 05:24.715
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Van Pelt.

05:24.802 --> 05:27.414
I've read everyone's file,
so I kind of know..

05:27.501 --> 05:30.678
Patrick Jane. Still making
my way through yours.

05:30.765 --> 05:32.244
It's a little bit
heavier reading.

05:32.332 --> 05:35.422
Yeah, do me a favor.
Don't tell me how it ends.

05:35.509 --> 05:37.249
[chuckles]

05:37.337 --> 05:40.775
Uh, hard times, everyone, um,
for the entire unit

05:40.862 --> 05:43.647
but, uh, things are about to get
a whole lot easier.

05:43.734 --> 05:47.477
I pride myself on two things,
trust and transparency.

05:47.564 --> 05:49.740
Excellent, so you'll
tell us how old you are?

05:49.827 --> 05:51.525
Rigsby here is running
an office pool.

05:51.612 --> 05:53.701
I'm not running a pool.

05:53.788 --> 05:55.703
Henry Tibbs. What's the plan?

05:55.790 --> 05:58.793
I suggest that we release him
and keep him under surveillance.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.622
Yeah, that sounds reasonable.
Keep me posted.

06:01.709 --> 06:04.929
Oh, um, your John Doe,
he may be a photographer.

06:05.016 --> 06:08.019
On long shoot days, that bandage
on the bridge of his nose

06:08.106 --> 06:10.065
would keep the nose pads
on his eyeglasses

06:10.152 --> 06:11.327
from digging into his skin.

06:11.414 --> 06:12.546
We'll check it out.

06:12.633 --> 06:14.243
Excellent. Thank you.

06:16.463 --> 06:17.377
Sharp.

06:24.906 --> 06:26.864
This is the surveillance car
you chose?

06:26.951 --> 06:29.606
We can't take an official
vehicle. We need to blend in.

06:29.693 --> 06:32.261
Okay, and, uh, this blends in?

06:32.348 --> 06:35.830
Nobody's forcing you
to go on this surveillance.

06:35.917 --> 06:38.267
You're right. Good point,
but I'm coming anyway.

06:38.354 --> 06:40.356
Did you bring a disguise?

06:45.492 --> 06:47.929
[car door opens]
"Did I bring a disguise?"

06:48.016 --> 06:49.583
So Wainright was spot-on.

06:49.670 --> 06:51.149
I checked
a professional directory

06:51.236 --> 06:53.238
for local photographers,
there he was. Scott Gibson.

06:53.325 --> 06:55.023
Spoke to the magazine
he works for.

06:55.110 --> 06:57.329
He was shooting
a photo essay of the homeless.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.114
- Do we know anything else?
- Clean record.

06:59.201 --> 07:00.985
Lives alone,
no family to speak of

07:01.072 --> 07:02.813
always carries a cell phone
on assignment.

07:02.900 --> 07:05.599
There was no phone
at the crime scene or a camera.

07:05.686 --> 07:07.296
Your robbery theory
is looking better.

07:07.383 --> 07:09.820
Let's hope so. Got a GPS track
on Gibson's phone.

07:09.907 --> 07:11.169
Residential neighborhood,
south of here.

07:11.256 --> 07:12.475
Way to bury the lead.

07:12.562 --> 07:13.650
- Let's go.
- Okay.

07:19.700 --> 07:22.354
[engine rumbling]

07:26.054 --> 07:27.664
[engine turns off]

07:27.751 --> 07:29.710
[Patrick sighs]
'Okay.'

07:31.625 --> 07:33.453
[exhales deeply]

07:33.540 --> 07:34.497
So what now?

07:34.584 --> 07:35.629
Now we wait.

07:35.716 --> 07:37.108
Wait for what?

07:37.195 --> 07:38.719
For Tibbs to come back out.

07:38.806 --> 07:40.982
That's no fun. I thought
the point of surveillance

07:41.069 --> 07:43.593
was to, uh, surveil.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.943
It's hard to do that
from inside a car.

07:46.030 --> 07:48.468
Well, I can't go in there.
Tibbs might recognize me.

07:48.555 --> 07:51.166
Mm. That is a problem.

07:51.253 --> 07:54.299
Well, he's never met me.
Problem solved.

07:54.386 --> 07:55.518
I'm gonna need these.

07:55.605 --> 07:56.519
Hey.

07:58.434 --> 07:59.391
Jane.

08:04.353 --> 08:07.138
[indistinct conversations]

08:13.623 --> 08:15.016
[southern accent]
Bourbon. Big one.

08:15.103 --> 08:18.367
Bigger than all hell
and half of Texas.

08:18.454 --> 08:20.500
A lone star man, huh?

08:20.587 --> 08:23.546
Yeah, what's it to ya, hoss?

08:23.633 --> 08:25.243
[chuckles]

08:28.595 --> 08:29.726
I seen you before.

08:29.813 --> 08:31.728
Yeah?

08:31.815 --> 08:33.469
Yeah. Let me think.

08:33.556 --> 08:40.084
"Soldier of fortune", weaponry
convention, Vegas, 2004.

08:40.171 --> 08:41.651
Nope.

08:41.738 --> 08:43.653
No? Well, that's too bad.

08:43.740 --> 08:45.568
That was full-auto
rock 'n' roll mayhem

08:45.655 --> 08:50.747
in the desert, my friend.
Uzis, floozies, and Jacuzzis.

08:50.834 --> 08:52.357
Weaponry convention, huh?

08:52.444 --> 08:53.881
Mm.

08:53.968 --> 08:56.623
One of the greatest weekends
of my life

08:56.710 --> 08:59.364
and I've had some weekends.

08:59.451 --> 09:03.020
No offense, pal. You don't look
like a weapons enthusiast.

09:03.107 --> 09:05.501
You wanna catch chickens,
you don't look like a fox.

09:05.588 --> 09:07.111
Am I right?

09:07.198 --> 09:08.635
Damn straight, I'm right.

09:11.376 --> 09:12.987
What's your weapon of choice?

09:13.074 --> 09:15.990
A loaded one.

09:16.077 --> 09:19.036
Can I get another
and one here for my friend?

09:31.092 --> 09:33.268
The cell phone signal came
from this house.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.496
Foreclosure property.
Door's ajar.

09:44.584 --> 09:45.889
[whispers]
You ready?

09:45.976 --> 09:47.325
[door creaks]

10:16.398 --> 10:18.705
Hey, back here.

10:18.792 --> 10:20.445
Hey, wake up.

10:20.532 --> 10:22.143
Wake up!

10:22.230 --> 10:26.016
Hands. Raise 'em high!
You have any weapons?

10:26.103 --> 10:28.758
- No, sir. I don't believe so.
- What about a cell phone?

10:28.845 --> 10:30.804
I believe
I got one in my bag.

10:30.891 --> 10:33.328
Keep your hands up.
I'll find them.

10:33.415 --> 10:34.677
[bag rustling]

10:34.764 --> 10:37.288
You look familiar.
What's your name?

10:37.375 --> 10:38.376
Willie.

10:40.378 --> 10:44.208
- Not Willie Shubert.
- You know this guy?

10:44.295 --> 10:47.603
He's a Bay Area Legend.
I had a bootleg of his first CD.

10:47.690 --> 10:51.128
It was all I listened to
in college.

10:51.215 --> 10:53.087
I always wondered
what happened to you.

10:58.005 --> 10:59.833
Listen up here, Willie.

10:59.920 --> 11:03.314
Some of the stuff you're
carrying came off a dead man.

11:03.401 --> 11:05.012
Well, that's not good.

11:05.099 --> 11:07.318
Neither is the dried blood
on your shirt.

11:07.405 --> 11:08.711
'How'd that get there?'

11:10.452 --> 11:11.671
Well, let's see. Uh..

11:13.281 --> 11:16.240
I got the blood on me
when I was stabbing

11:16.327 --> 11:19.940
that fella in the alley.

11:20.027 --> 11:23.247
A trueman, a realman has
but one purpose in this world.

11:23.334 --> 11:25.554
- He lives to fight.
- That's what I'm talking about.

11:25.641 --> 11:27.251
It doesn't matter who he is

11:27.338 --> 11:30.472
what status the world puts,
it's what's in here that counts.

11:30.559 --> 11:32.300
- Mm-hmm.
- Fighting the enemy.

11:32.387 --> 11:33.475
Combating evil.

11:33.562 --> 11:34.998
- Mm-hmm.
- That's nobility.

11:35.085 --> 11:37.087
That's what makes
a man a hero!

11:37.174 --> 11:39.307
Amen, brother.

11:39.394 --> 11:40.874
I'm pretty much done here.

11:40.961 --> 11:42.832
What kinda evil
are you fighting, mostly?

11:45.574 --> 11:48.098
Why do you care?
I don't even know you.

11:48.185 --> 11:51.014
[chuckles]

11:51.101 --> 11:53.495
I don't know you either

11:53.582 --> 11:55.236
but I like you.

11:55.323 --> 11:58.369
Come here.
I wanna show you somethin'.

11:58.456 --> 12:00.067
[alarm chirps]

12:07.770 --> 12:09.598
Check that out.

12:09.685 --> 12:12.732
Remington 700.
That is nice.

12:12.819 --> 12:15.256
You carry this around
in your car?

12:15.343 --> 12:18.433
Never know when
a grizzly bear might appear.

12:18.520 --> 12:20.827
Go on. Feel the weight
of that honey.

12:24.178 --> 12:25.788
[clears throat]

12:29.226 --> 12:31.663
Oh.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.361
That's nice.

12:40.585 --> 12:44.154
[Patrick]
'Yeah, makes you wonder,
doesn't it?'

12:44.241 --> 12:47.244
What it'd feel like
to take that shot?

12:49.769 --> 12:52.946
What, on a human being?

12:53.033 --> 12:56.210
We live in a target-rich
environment, my friend.

12:57.428 --> 13:00.823
'It'd be soeasy.'

13:04.435 --> 13:06.350
[chuckles]
Yes, it would.

13:06.437 --> 13:09.005
And you are
a full-on psycho, my friend.

13:09.092 --> 13:12.095
I'm hammered. I'm gonna, um..

13:12.182 --> 13:13.705
Give me that here.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.186
- I'm gonna walk home tonight.
- Get outta here.

13:16.273 --> 13:18.449
Stay frosty.

13:21.539 --> 13:24.107
[inhales deeply]

13:24.194 --> 13:27.415
[exhales deeply]

13:27.502 --> 13:30.461
Let's go. Lisbon's called off
the surveillance on Tibbs.

13:30.548 --> 13:31.985
They think they've found
their killer.

13:32.072 --> 13:34.248
I know I found mine.

13:40.776 --> 13:42.996
I thought I saw something
in Tibbs' eyes yesterday

13:43.083 --> 13:45.476
but I wanted to make sure,
last night I did.

13:45.563 --> 13:46.695
What'd you see?

13:46.782 --> 13:48.566
He's a man on autopilot.

13:50.177 --> 13:51.526
Set to kill.

13:53.397 --> 13:55.835
If we weren't there to stop him
yesterday, I'm confident

13:55.922 --> 13:57.532
he would've pulled the trigger.

13:57.619 --> 14:00.274
- You got that from his eyes?
- Pretty much.

14:00.361 --> 14:03.451
I'm not doubting you.
I'm just...fascinated.

14:03.538 --> 14:06.019
Well, there was the tension
in his body as well

14:06.106 --> 14:09.805
and the overcoat,
but, uh...the eyes were enough.

14:09.892 --> 14:12.329
The trouble is, I mean,
even if you are right

14:12.416 --> 14:14.375
we can't arrest an offender
before he's offended.

14:14.462 --> 14:17.421
It's better than after,
don't you think?

14:17.508 --> 14:19.206
See, here's the problem
with working homicide.

14:19.293 --> 14:20.903
There's so much death.

14:20.990 --> 14:22.949
Tibbs is a man on the verge.

14:23.036 --> 14:26.126
He's a man
on the threshold of murder

14:26.213 --> 14:27.867
possibly even mass murder.

14:27.954 --> 14:30.608
Now who wouldn't wanna try
and stop that kind of nightmare?

14:30.695 --> 14:32.175
Theoretical criminology.

14:32.262 --> 14:34.221
I took that class.
I think it's fascinating.

14:34.308 --> 14:36.701
Uh, it just has
no practical value.

14:36.788 --> 14:39.226
No practical value? I guess the
same could be said

14:39.313 --> 14:41.837
for middle management
bureaucrats.

14:41.924 --> 14:44.318
Chafe as you may, against
the bridle of responsibility

14:44.405 --> 14:46.624
we can't shortchange
due process.

14:46.711 --> 14:48.539
Now, following
a potential offender around

14:48.626 --> 14:50.019
is a waste of resources.

14:50.106 --> 14:51.847
Yeah, you're right.

14:51.934 --> 14:55.155
What we need here
is a confidence trick.

14:55.242 --> 14:56.417
A what?

14:56.504 --> 15:00.073
Scam. Hustle. Bunco. Flimflam.

15:00.160 --> 15:03.511
If we can get inside
the world of Henry Tibbs

15:03.598 --> 15:06.079
then I can predict
when and where he will blow.

15:06.166 --> 15:09.865
All we have to do is pop out and
arrest him for attempted murder.

15:09.952 --> 15:12.128
Before we go
too far down this path

15:12.215 --> 15:15.175
I'm not ready to rule out Tibbs
as an actual murder suspect.

15:15.262 --> 15:16.698
'Didn't Willie Shubert confess?'

15:16.785 --> 15:18.700
Yes, he did,
but I don't believe him.

15:18.787 --> 15:20.267
Look at his history.

15:20.354 --> 15:22.878
Mental illness,
substance abuse, vagrancy.

15:22.965 --> 15:25.141
Exactly, and he was covered
in the victim's blood

15:25.228 --> 15:26.708
and in possession
of his belongings.

15:26.795 --> 15:28.928
Yes, b-but there's
no record of violence.

15:29.015 --> 15:31.931
I think that his confession
was a cry for help.

15:32.018 --> 15:34.846
- Willie didn't hurt anyone.
- How do you know that?

15:34.934 --> 15:37.806
You kind of have
to hear him play the saxophone.

15:38.894 --> 15:40.722
I love it, Lisbon.

15:40.809 --> 15:42.550
The beautiful soul defense.

15:44.378 --> 15:46.075
'You two want me believe'

15:46.162 --> 15:48.773
that a man who confessed
to murder did nothing

15:48.860 --> 15:51.211
and a man who did nothing
is a murderer?

15:51.298 --> 15:53.430
You may even be smarter
than you look.

15:53.517 --> 15:55.955
I think Tibbs is a dead end

15:56.042 --> 15:59.828
but I like to reward passion,
so...go prove me wrong.

15:59.915 --> 16:01.873
You have 24 hours
to demonstrate

16:01.961 --> 16:05.529
that Tibbs poses
an imminent danger

16:05.616 --> 16:07.792
and I'm sending
the Shubert case to the DA.

16:07.879 --> 16:10.360
What about my passion?

16:10.447 --> 16:14.060
I called my shot.
Excuse me.

16:14.147 --> 16:17.063
Okay, the goal is
to get close to Tibbs

16:17.150 --> 16:19.935
to figure out
when he will snap.

16:20.022 --> 16:24.200
We're gonna play this...
like a long con.

16:24.287 --> 16:26.811
Rigsby, your objective is
to exploit

16:26.898 --> 16:28.770
the mark's dreams and desires.

16:28.857 --> 16:31.425
Uh, the one thing
we do know about Tibbs..

16:31.512 --> 16:33.035
...he desires a job.

16:33.122 --> 16:34.819
Now according
to Van Pelt's research

16:34.906 --> 16:37.300
he's already gone downtown
and applied for one

16:37.387 --> 16:39.389
at the Goldwyn Insurance Group.

16:39.476 --> 16:40.912
They've rejected
his application

16:41.000 --> 16:42.784
but Tibbs doesn't know that yet

16:42.871 --> 16:46.222
so we need the Goldwyn Group
to lend us a meeting room

16:46.309 --> 16:49.312
so we can conduct
a fake job interview.

16:49.399 --> 16:53.403
We also need to know about his family life or lack thereof.

16:53.490 --> 16:56.058
It seems the lady of the house, Linda Tibbs

16:56.145 --> 16:58.060
has filed for a divorce.

16:58.147 --> 16:59.757
We need to know why.

16:59.844 --> 17:02.847
So, Van Pelt, you'll find out where she works

17:02.934 --> 17:04.719
and you will make contact.

17:04.806 --> 17:07.678
Cho, I think it's best
you ditch the race car

17:07.765 --> 17:09.811
and find something
a little more modest

17:09.898 --> 17:12.379
to keep the mark
under surveillance.

17:12.466 --> 17:14.729
Let's have fun.

17:14.816 --> 17:16.035
Good luck to all.

17:34.662 --> 17:36.055
'Your first CD.'

17:37.447 --> 17:40.885
Only CD.
I still have it.

17:42.887 --> 17:46.239
Back in college, whenever
I missed my family in Chicago

17:46.326 --> 17:50.678
I would listen to it.
It helped.

17:50.765 --> 17:53.942
I've been doing
some research on you, Willie.

17:54.029 --> 17:58.120
Not long after you made
this album, you lost your wife.

17:58.207 --> 18:00.253
'Car accident, right?'

18:00.340 --> 18:03.734
You were driving? Is that
why you stopped playing?

18:03.821 --> 18:05.562
What do you want?

18:05.649 --> 18:07.869
Why you confessed to a murder
you didn't commit.

18:07.956 --> 18:12.047
I don't know what you're talking
about. I stuck that boy!

18:12.134 --> 18:14.180
Ready to get
what I got coming.

18:14.267 --> 18:16.486
You need to understand
the reality

18:16.573 --> 18:18.575
of what's going on, Willie.

18:18.662 --> 18:20.403
The DA will put you
in prison.

18:20.490 --> 18:24.755
[scoffs]
I'm old, tired
of sleeping in alleys.

18:24.842 --> 18:27.715
I ain't got no place to go.
Prison's someplace.

18:27.802 --> 18:31.458
And a lethal injection is part
of the vacation package.

18:32.894 --> 18:34.809
You'll get three hots
and a cot

18:34.896 --> 18:36.767
just for stealing off
a dead body.

18:39.292 --> 18:41.511
What do you say
we come clean on this

18:41.598 --> 18:43.557
so we can keep you alive?

18:46.299 --> 18:48.953
Okay, yeah.

18:50.607 --> 18:54.959
Tell me what happened
yesterday.

18:55.046 --> 18:59.138
That fellow that took my photo
earlier in the day had..

18:59.225 --> 19:02.924
...gave me $20
for my photo rights

19:03.011 --> 19:04.795
but when I found him dead

19:04.882 --> 19:07.146
his wallet was laying
on the ground, empty.

19:07.233 --> 19:08.799
Why did you take it?

19:08.886 --> 19:12.716
It's real leather.

19:12.803 --> 19:15.241
And what about the camera?
What happened to that?

19:15.328 --> 19:18.244
I found the cell phone
in his jacket pocket.

19:18.331 --> 19:20.028
I didn't see no camera.

19:22.335 --> 19:26.339
I'm gonna get you out of this,
whether you like it or not.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.779
Thank you.

19:31.866 --> 19:33.346
[receiver clatters]

19:33.433 --> 19:35.696
- You ready? He's here.
- Not really.

19:35.783 --> 19:38.394
Have a seat, please.
Mr. Rigsby will be right in.

19:38.481 --> 19:40.875
He's one
of our senior executives.

19:42.355 --> 19:44.313
'What do you want me
to ask him?'

19:44.400 --> 19:46.272
Ask him whatever you want.
You're charming.

19:46.359 --> 19:47.795
Just get him to open up.

19:47.882 --> 19:49.405
Okay.

19:49.492 --> 19:51.277
The questions
that Agent Wainright gave me?

19:51.364 --> 19:53.844
- Wainright gave you questions?
- Yeah.

19:53.931 --> 19:56.151
He says they're designed
to elicit a patterned response

19:56.238 --> 19:59.067
to determine
antisocial personality disorder.

19:59.154 --> 20:02.418
Well, maybe they'll make you
sound extra-smart just like him.

20:02.505 --> 20:04.812
Okay. Wish me luck.

20:04.899 --> 20:07.249
You'll be fine.
Just don't be yourself.

20:07.336 --> 20:09.295
Whoa. Hang on.
What is that?

20:09.382 --> 20:12.776
That is a large pimple forming
above your brow there.

20:12.863 --> 20:14.343
I don't know. Is there?

20:14.430 --> 20:16.432
Actually, no.
It looks more like a melanoma.

20:16.519 --> 20:19.087
- What? Are you sure?
- No, I'm not.

20:19.174 --> 20:21.916
You should get that checked out
as soon as you can.

20:22.003 --> 20:23.265
- Now run along.
- Mm-hmm.

20:26.094 --> 20:27.530
[door opens]

20:29.053 --> 20:30.359
[closes door]

20:30.446 --> 20:31.795
- Hi.
- Hello, Mr. Tibbs.

20:31.882 --> 20:34.145
Wayne Rigsby.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.104
Named after the duke himself.

20:36.191 --> 20:38.149
Yeah, my dad liked his westerns.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.716
A man after my own heart.

20:39.803 --> 20:41.762
My family's been raising
crops, cattle, and children

20:41.849 --> 20:43.242
in Texas for two centuries.

20:43.329 --> 20:45.896
So, Mr. Tibbs,
uh, what kind of..

20:45.983 --> 20:48.899
'what kind of an employee
would you describe yourself as?'

20:48.986 --> 20:51.424
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, thank you.

20:51.511 --> 20:53.513
I'm here to talk about
your husband Henry.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.297
Grace Van Pelt with the CBI.

20:55.384 --> 20:57.299
[sighs]
What'd he do?

20:57.386 --> 20:58.866
Nothing yet,
but we have reason

20:58.953 --> 21:00.650
to believe that
he might be dangerous.

21:00.737 --> 21:03.392
"Might be"?
That's a good one.

21:03.479 --> 21:05.133
Talk to me.

21:06.787 --> 21:09.268
No, ma'am. I have been
talking for a long time

21:09.355 --> 21:12.488
and I am tired
of nobody listening.

21:12.575 --> 21:14.795
Look, I don't know
who you've been talking to

21:14.882 --> 21:16.362
but I'll take you seriously.

21:16.449 --> 21:18.364
No.

21:18.451 --> 21:21.062
I am not getting lured back
into this again.

21:21.149 --> 21:24.500
I even had a judge turn me away
for being the unstable one.

21:24.587 --> 21:27.938
I'm taking care of myself
from now on.

21:28.025 --> 21:30.376
Rachel, can you cover
this table for me, please?

21:32.943 --> 21:34.684
I have a Master's
in Forensic Psych.

21:34.771 --> 21:36.599
The questions
I gave Rigsby came

21:36.686 --> 21:38.906
from a standardized test
to diagnose psychopathy.

21:38.993 --> 21:41.169
Tricking our mark into taking
a mental health test.

21:41.256 --> 21:43.171
Nice touch.

21:43.258 --> 21:45.913
Just embracing
your spirit of the con.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.525
I cross-referenced Tibbs'
answers with his background.

21:49.612 --> 21:51.832
Do you have any idea
what the test revealed?

21:51.919 --> 21:54.182
No, but I can't wait
to find out.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.620
Nothing.

21:57.707 --> 22:00.580
No evidence of
criminal psychopathy whatsoever.

22:00.667 --> 22:03.278
Tibbs is just
an out-of-work insurance broker.

22:03.365 --> 22:07.064
A monster without conscience,
void of any human empathy.

22:07.151 --> 22:09.980
- Jane.
- Hey, tests can be fooled.

22:10.067 --> 22:13.070
Human behavior never lies.

22:13.157 --> 22:14.855
Normal people,
they can't help but imitate

22:14.942 --> 22:16.378
what happens
in their social world.

22:16.465 --> 22:18.598
One of the most
mimicked behaviors..

22:18.685 --> 22:20.164
...face-touching.

22:20.251 --> 22:23.820
Observe Agent Rigsby,
as neurotic as a border collie.

22:23.907 --> 22:26.127
He can't stop touching his face.

22:26.214 --> 22:30.784
Now Tibbs, his hands never
leave the table, not once.

22:30.871 --> 22:32.916
That's, uh, quite a leap.

22:33.003 --> 22:34.091
Is it?

22:34.178 --> 22:36.224
Look how you're sitting
right now.

22:36.311 --> 22:38.748
You're leaning back with your
legs crossed, just like me.

22:38.835 --> 22:40.794
Oh, please,
but I always sit this way.

22:40.881 --> 22:42.230
You do? Oh.

22:42.317 --> 22:45.320
Hmm. Maybe you're right.

22:45.407 --> 22:48.062
Of course I'm right.

22:50.107 --> 22:51.761
See? You're normal.

22:51.848 --> 22:54.721
That man has the conscience
of a mollusk.

22:54.808 --> 22:56.549
[no audio]

23:07.821 --> 23:09.562
Hey, Tibbs.

23:21.617 --> 23:23.576
- I'm with him.
- Alright. Go ahead.

23:35.501 --> 23:37.894
[engine turns off]

23:40.462 --> 23:41.855
[gunshot]

23:43.291 --> 23:45.206
[gunshots]

24:08.577 --> 24:12.929
[laughs]
Hey. Bad year for Merlot.

24:13.016 --> 24:15.105
'That's my case. You can, uh..'

24:15.192 --> 24:17.368
You can try to hit one,
if you want.

24:17.456 --> 24:18.413
Okay.

24:33.341 --> 24:34.298
Thanks.

24:34.385 --> 24:35.735
No problem.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.261
[machine gunfire]

24:57.147 --> 24:58.758
[cheering]

25:01.195 --> 25:03.153
[indistinct conversations]

25:12.380 --> 25:14.208
Suspect was shooting zombies
with an illegal M240 Bravo

25:14.295 --> 25:16.123
belt-fed, gas-operated.

25:16.210 --> 25:17.777
Zombies?

25:17.864 --> 25:19.518
Lifelike targets. Mannequins.

25:19.605 --> 25:22.259
- No wonder Tibbs' wife left.
- What'd you learn?

25:22.346 --> 25:24.566
She wouldn't talk, but according
to a protective order

25:24.653 --> 25:26.873
she filed in May,
they got into a fight.

25:26.960 --> 25:30.006
He took a hammer to the bedroom.
Blamed her for his failures.

25:30.093 --> 25:32.269
I'm sorry. I don't remember
a protective order.

25:32.356 --> 25:35.403
Judge denied it, said Linda's
request wasn't specific enough

25:35.490 --> 25:36.796
to constitute an emergency.

25:36.883 --> 25:38.101
She's scared of him

25:38.188 --> 25:40.147
but can't get anyone
to take her seriously.

25:40.234 --> 25:42.192
One, Tibbs is living
a life of failure

25:42.279 --> 25:44.978
two, he's socially isolated,
three, he owns firearms

25:45.065 --> 25:48.111
and four,
his wife just left him.

25:48.198 --> 25:50.331
Classic 4-pointed profile
of a mass shooter.

25:50.418 --> 25:52.638
We'll arrest Henry Tibbs
on a felony weapons charge

25:52.725 --> 25:54.988
then we can insist
on counseling.

25:55.075 --> 25:57.730
What happens in a couple months
when he hits the streets?

25:57.817 --> 25:59.209
He reports to parole.

25:59.296 --> 26:01.298
We all know
how effective that is.

26:01.385 --> 26:04.693
- There is no ideal system.
- Sure, there is.

26:04.780 --> 26:06.956
We follow Tibbs,
and catch him in the act

26:07.043 --> 26:08.567
of attempted mass murder.

26:08.654 --> 26:10.960
Jury puts him away for life.
It's that simple.

26:11.047 --> 26:14.355
You are quite the Pied Piper,
Mr. Jane. Quite the salesman.

26:14.442 --> 26:17.140
I happen to think counseling
is our best option right now.

26:17.227 --> 26:20.404
All due respect, chief,
but isn't it worth a shot?

26:20.491 --> 26:23.930
I will not follow around
an almost-bad guy

26:24.017 --> 26:25.584
just waiting for him
to snap.

26:25.671 --> 26:28.978
I vowed to make a prediction,
so predict I shall.

26:29.065 --> 26:32.852
Before the sun sets today,
Henry Tibbs will make his move.

26:34.288 --> 26:35.681
Give us that long.

26:37.117 --> 26:39.032
You have until
the end of the day.

26:41.295 --> 26:42.383
[Cho clears throat]

26:42.470 --> 26:44.690
Is Lisbon always this late?

26:44.777 --> 26:46.213
She had some personal business.

26:47.214 --> 26:48.476
[jingles]

26:50.478 --> 26:51.435
[closes door]

26:54.787 --> 26:56.876
Good morning.
I'm with the CBI.

26:56.963 --> 26:58.660
I need to know
if somebody pawned

26:58.747 --> 27:00.706
a camera here
in the past 24 hours.

27:00.793 --> 27:02.359
'Take a look.'

27:02.446 --> 27:05.841
A high-end DSLR in a case
with multiple lenses.

27:05.928 --> 27:07.930
Oh, yeah.
That one came in last night.

27:08.017 --> 27:11.107
A mangy guy brought it in.
Rotten teeth, dog breath.

27:13.893 --> 27:16.504
That camera is evidence
in a homicide investigation.

27:16.591 --> 27:18.593
- Where is it at now?
- Sold it.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.595
Do you have a record
of the purchase?

27:23.206 --> 27:25.513
Alright. How about
the memory card? You sell that?

27:25.600 --> 27:27.907
I sell those separately.

27:27.994 --> 27:29.865
More money for me.

27:29.952 --> 27:32.476
That one had a 32 gig card.

27:34.827 --> 27:36.742
I need a working digital camera.

27:36.829 --> 27:37.743
Sure.

27:41.268 --> 27:43.836
Thirty bucks.

27:43.923 --> 27:45.925
I'll give you five
for a two-minute rental.

28:01.201 --> 28:02.724
[Lisbon]
'Do you know this man?'

28:02.811 --> 28:05.945
[Willie chuckles]
Mike Flynn.

28:06.032 --> 28:09.731
Anger management issues.

28:09.818 --> 28:12.168
And I know where he keeps
his bedroll, too.

28:15.432 --> 28:18.697
- Mike Flynn?
- Get the hell out of my house!

28:20.176 --> 28:21.874
You are Mike Flynn, right?

28:21.961 --> 28:24.267
And y-you're
in a man's house, and I..

28:24.354 --> 28:26.313
I'll call the police
if you don't go.

28:26.400 --> 28:27.357
- Just calm down.
- Now!

28:27.444 --> 28:28.881
Calm down.
We are the police.

28:28.968 --> 28:30.360
[panting]

28:30.447 --> 28:32.101
Sushi for lunch?

28:32.188 --> 28:34.887
Expensive
goose-down sleeping bag?

28:34.974 --> 28:36.845
How'd you pay for this stuff?

28:38.107 --> 28:39.761
The streets have been
kind lately.

28:39.848 --> 28:41.981
We need to check
your backpack, okay?

28:49.118 --> 28:51.512
- Put it down!
- Hey. Take it easy.

28:51.599 --> 28:52.687
Drop it.

28:53.340 --> 28:54.471
Put it down.

29:00.390 --> 29:03.176
I have a photo of you coming
after a murder victim

29:03.263 --> 29:06.919
with that knife. You wanna
explain that, Mr. Flynn?

29:07.006 --> 29:08.834
I-I don't like having
my photo taken.

29:08.921 --> 29:11.097
[cell phone ringing]
Get your hands
behind your back.

29:11.184 --> 29:12.838
[Rigsby]
'Now.'

29:12.925 --> 29:14.448
[ringing continues]

29:14.535 --> 29:16.537
- Lisbon.
- 'It's Cho.'

29:16.624 --> 29:20.236
'I just lost Tibbs on
the freeway. He's off the grid.'

29:20.323 --> 29:22.673
Should we be worried?

29:22.761 --> 29:25.633
What was Tibbs doing
before Cho lost sight of him?

29:25.720 --> 29:27.461
Driving around the city,
aimless.

29:27.548 --> 29:30.116
As predicted, he's trying
to work up the courage.

29:30.203 --> 29:32.466
Can't even put out
a BOLO to find him.

29:32.553 --> 29:35.512
We can pick him on a weapons
charge for the machine gun.

29:35.599 --> 29:37.384
Oh. Whoa.

29:37.471 --> 29:40.474
You promised. Sunset. If
I can get inside his house

29:40.561 --> 29:43.042
I know I can figure out
where Tibbs will go.

29:43.129 --> 29:45.566
You'll never get a judge
to grant you a warrant.

29:45.653 --> 29:47.437
'Wait a minute.
We don't need one.'

29:47.524 --> 29:49.483
All we need is permission
from a homeowner.

29:51.093 --> 29:53.704
I already told you,
I'm not getting involved.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.533
We're not asking you to.
We need for you to cooperate.

29:56.620 --> 30:00.233
It doesn't matter. I don't trust
you, and I'm not gonna help.

30:00.320 --> 30:03.845
If you quit now, you're gonna
miss the best part. Payback.

30:03.932 --> 30:05.151
What are you talking about?

30:05.238 --> 30:10.199
A few months ago,
I had a fiance who..

30:10.286 --> 30:12.506
- Well, he tried to kill me.
- You're lying.

30:12.593 --> 30:14.551
Look, everybody thought
he was the greatest guy

30:14.638 --> 30:18.120
including me,
until he pulled a gun.

30:18.207 --> 30:19.426
What did you do?

30:19.513 --> 30:20.862
I shot him.

30:22.733 --> 30:23.691
Dead.

30:28.870 --> 30:32.526
[inhales deeply]
What can I do to help?

30:32.613 --> 30:34.006
We need to search your house.

30:44.190 --> 30:48.020
- Nice.
- Well, it's a choice.

30:48.107 --> 30:50.065
Lacks a woman's touch.

30:58.813 --> 31:00.423
Got something.

31:06.081 --> 31:07.256
[Patrick]
'Wow.'

31:07.343 --> 31:10.607
The imagination station.

31:14.307 --> 31:16.048
"All that's necessary
for evil to triumph

31:16.135 --> 31:17.658
'is that good men
do nothing."'

31:17.745 --> 31:20.356
That's, uh, Edmund Burke,
I believe.

31:24.621 --> 31:27.624
[Lisbon]
'Wherever Tibbs is, at least
he doesn't have these with him.'

31:27.711 --> 31:30.497
Well, he may have
other weapons.

31:32.238 --> 31:34.414
Check this out.

31:34.501 --> 31:37.504
[Lisbon]
'The mayor's public appearance
schedule.'

31:37.591 --> 31:40.072
I wonder what he did
for Tibbs to target him.

31:40.159 --> 31:43.118
Doesn't matter. All Tibbs
cares about is the rush

31:43.205 --> 31:44.946
that comes from killing
an important man.

31:45.033 --> 31:47.862
The mayor's power
becomes his power.

31:47.949 --> 31:50.169
[Lisbon]
'Where is Tibbs now?'

31:50.256 --> 31:53.433
'Who else do you think would be
a target for his rage?'

31:53.520 --> 31:58.568
I don't know, but he hasn't
signed his divorce papers yet.

31:58.655 --> 32:01.354
Do we have someone at the diner
where Tibbs' wife works?

32:05.488 --> 32:07.447
[door closes]

32:07.534 --> 32:10.058
Where is she?
Where's my wife?

32:11.581 --> 32:13.279
Duffel bag could be a weapon.

32:13.366 --> 32:15.368
- 'Where's my wife?'
- We need to hold back.

32:15.455 --> 32:18.153
We move too soon, we blow
our whole cover with Tibbs.

32:18.240 --> 32:21.069
- Can I help you?
- I don't know, man.

32:21.156 --> 32:23.071
You helping my wife
hide from me?

32:23.158 --> 32:25.030
Linda went home early today.

32:25.117 --> 32:28.033
[chuckles]
She didn't go home.

32:28.120 --> 32:31.253
She hasn't been home in weeks.

32:31.340 --> 32:34.430
She staying with you?
You can tell me.

32:34.517 --> 32:36.606
You hot for my wife?

32:36.693 --> 32:38.826
You bangin'my wife?

32:38.913 --> 32:41.568
[sighs]
I need you to go now.

32:41.655 --> 32:44.223
Please? You're scaring
my customers.

32:49.228 --> 32:50.925
Okay, I'll go.

32:51.012 --> 32:53.232
Next time you see Linda..

32:53.319 --> 32:55.277
...give her something from me.

32:55.364 --> 32:56.713
[unzips]

33:01.196 --> 33:02.981
Tell her to choke on these.

33:10.075 --> 33:12.468
Well, at least
you didn't shoot this one.

33:18.257 --> 33:19.867
If I understand
this correctly

33:19.954 --> 33:22.913
two of my agents almost shot
a man in a crowded diner

33:23.001 --> 33:24.480
for bringing his wife
flowers.

33:24.567 --> 33:26.439
"Almost" is the key word there.

33:26.526 --> 33:29.442
I've listened.
I've empathized.

33:29.529 --> 33:31.052
I've heard enough.

33:31.139 --> 33:33.402
Case is too dangerous.
We need a new approach.

33:33.489 --> 33:35.317
Agreed. No more sitting around
and waiting

33:35.404 --> 33:37.363
for something to push Tibbs
over the edge.

33:37.450 --> 33:39.191
We need to create
our own stressor.

33:39.278 --> 33:42.020
Are you saying, incite
the suspect to violence?

33:42.107 --> 33:44.805
It wouldn't take much. Cut off
the power to his house

33:44.892 --> 33:46.589
a couple of eggs on his truck.

33:46.676 --> 33:49.201
Enough to make him go berserk,
do something violent.

33:49.288 --> 33:50.898
You're off the case, Jane.

33:50.985 --> 33:53.770
Actually, as a matter of fact,
there is no case.

33:53.857 --> 33:57.600
Henry Tibbs is a sick man,
and he needs psychological help.

33:57.687 --> 33:59.559
What if he can't be helped?

33:59.646 --> 34:02.953
Weare the criminals then,
if we don't at least try.

34:03.041 --> 34:07.436
- I'm taking Rigsby and Cho.
- Where?

34:07.523 --> 34:10.265
I'm arresting Henry Tibbs
on felony weapons charges.

34:12.833 --> 34:16.054
I wonder if our new boss
is in a little over his head.

34:16.141 --> 34:17.490
Really? I don't.

34:17.577 --> 34:18.665
Tibbs could kill him.

34:18.752 --> 34:20.710
Or he could save Tibbs.

34:31.330 --> 34:34.115
Okay, you two,
cover the back.

34:39.903 --> 34:42.819
I'm sick of watching everyone
play with this man's life.

34:44.560 --> 34:45.605
Yeah?

34:50.088 --> 34:52.351
You're with
the Goldwyn Group, right?

34:52.438 --> 34:54.744
Is this about
the job interview?

34:54.831 --> 34:57.356
No, sir.
I'm afraid it's not.

34:57.443 --> 35:00.315
Hi, Henry.
My name is Luther Wainright.

35:02.796 --> 35:04.885
Hold on.
You-you were at CBI.

35:04.972 --> 35:07.366
That's right.
We are with the government.

35:07.453 --> 35:09.629
We've been watching you.

35:09.716 --> 35:10.804
You what?

35:10.891 --> 35:12.501
We spoke with your wife,
Henry.

35:12.588 --> 35:15.939
We know you're in a lot of pain
and we're worried about you.

35:16.026 --> 35:17.637
The government
would like to help.

35:17.724 --> 35:20.727
Wait. Wait, wait.
What the hell is going on?

35:20.814 --> 35:23.686
Look, I know this is all
pretty confusing

35:23.773 --> 35:25.384
and we're gonna explain
everything.

35:25.471 --> 35:27.429
First, however, we need
to search your house.

35:27.516 --> 35:30.824
- I have a warrant right here.
- You don't need a warrant.

35:30.911 --> 35:34.958
You can come inside my house.
I got nothing to hide.

35:35.045 --> 35:37.570
- Thank you.
- Oh. Excuse me, sir.

35:37.657 --> 35:39.963
We're busting in.
Cover the rear exit.

35:40.050 --> 35:41.269
Hold the door.

35:41.356 --> 35:42.705
[engine revving]

35:48.494 --> 35:50.887
Hey. This is Wainright.
Tibbs is on the run.

35:50.974 --> 35:53.238
Get us a bird in the air.

35:53.325 --> 35:56.502
Hey, Jane. Tibbs evaded arrest.
He's on the move.

36:00.506 --> 36:01.420
Okay.

36:29.578 --> 36:30.710
You.

36:30.797 --> 36:32.190
Hey, Henry.

36:34.279 --> 36:35.323
[crowd gasps]

36:35.410 --> 36:37.891
Okay. Stay calm. Don't move.

36:37.978 --> 36:40.676
Do not draw your weapons.
This man will not hurt you.

36:40.763 --> 36:43.375
He cannot hurt you.

36:44.854 --> 36:45.855
No.

36:45.942 --> 36:47.596
Isn't that right, Henry?

36:47.683 --> 36:50.773
What the hell are you
talking about?

36:50.860 --> 36:54.342
You don't wanna pull that
trigger. You think you do.

36:54.429 --> 36:57.127
You think it'll switch off
that vacancy sign in your soul

36:57.215 --> 37:00.566
but the truth is, taking
a life's just gonna make things

37:00.653 --> 37:05.135
a whole lot more complicated.
Believe me.

37:05.223 --> 37:07.660
I don't expect to live
past today.

37:07.747 --> 37:10.097
But you can.
You haven't hurt anyone yet.

37:10.184 --> 37:11.707
You put that gun away now

37:11.794 --> 37:15.233
and we will get you
the help that you need.

37:15.320 --> 37:17.104
I think..

37:19.237 --> 37:21.630
I think it's too late for me..

37:23.502 --> 37:25.373
...and everyone here.

37:25.460 --> 37:28.158
[screaming]

37:28.246 --> 37:29.856
Hold on, boss.

37:42.912 --> 37:45.045
Whew.

37:45.132 --> 37:47.308
Loud.

37:47.395 --> 37:50.485
Hey. How ya doin'?

37:50.572 --> 37:53.053
You're under arrest
for the attempted murder of..

37:53.140 --> 37:56.012
...everybody. Turn around.
Put your hands on your head.

37:56.099 --> 37:57.710
[handcuffs rattle]

38:03.193 --> 38:05.195
What's going on?
How come no one's hurt?

38:05.283 --> 38:06.762
When we searched Tibbs' house

38:06.849 --> 38:09.069
we replaced all of
his live rounds with blanks

38:09.156 --> 38:10.897
in case we lost him again.

38:12.681 --> 38:14.509
So long, partner.

38:14.596 --> 38:15.945
Let's go.

38:19.427 --> 38:22.387
The DA is offering you
90 days in county jail

38:22.474 --> 38:26.216
if you plead no contest to two
counts of theft from a body.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.262
You'll have a warm bed
for the winter

38:28.349 --> 38:31.134
and shelter waiting for you
when you get out.

38:31.221 --> 38:32.832
Sounds good.

38:35.704 --> 38:37.532
Thanks.

38:37.619 --> 38:41.275
Oh, um, I was
in the pawnshop today

38:41.362 --> 38:43.146
and I picked something up
I thought

38:43.233 --> 38:45.671
maybe you could use
when you get out.

38:52.373 --> 38:54.897
I haven't played
one of these in years.

38:54.984 --> 38:56.943
I didn't think so.

38:57.030 --> 39:00.076
Your lawyer's gonna be here
in a couple of minutes.

39:00.163 --> 39:02.862
You take of yourself,
Willie.

39:04.994 --> 39:06.300
[blinds rattle]

39:12.393 --> 39:14.787
[saxophone music]

39:34.241 --> 39:36.678
Uh..

39:36.765 --> 39:40.290
That's, uh, that's
kind of...my spot.

39:40.378 --> 39:41.944
Oh.

39:42.031 --> 39:45.383
- Right. Sorry.
- Yeah.

39:45.470 --> 39:48.429
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

39:48.516 --> 39:49.909
[inhales deeply and sighs]

39:52.955 --> 39:56.045
You, uh, set me up today.

39:56.132 --> 40:00.136
You knew I would be the stressor
that pushed Tibbs over the edge.

40:00.223 --> 40:02.965
Well, one can never
really know these things.

40:03.052 --> 40:05.011
To be honest,
I was rooting for you.

40:05.098 --> 40:06.665
- Really?
- Yes.

40:06.752 --> 40:09.319
I find your, uh,
youthful brand of earnestness

40:09.407 --> 40:10.973
quite refreshing.

40:11.060 --> 40:13.759
How did you know Tibbs was
gonna go to that garden?

40:13.846 --> 40:15.325
Educated guess.

40:15.413 --> 40:18.154
He had it circled
in his calendar.

40:18.241 --> 40:21.331
Well, then why on earth wouldn't
you clear the area first?

40:21.419 --> 40:24.465
The plan that was approved
by, uh...you

40:24.552 --> 40:30.471
was to catch Tibbs
in the act, I believe.

40:33.343 --> 40:35.389
You know that psychopathy test
I gave Tibbs?

40:35.476 --> 40:37.217
Mm.

40:37.304 --> 40:39.828
I figured out
why it didn't work.

40:39.915 --> 40:42.265
See, it's a rating scale
based on observation

40:42.352 --> 40:44.572
so the more time you spend
with the subject

40:44.659 --> 40:46.705
the more accurately you can
then observe

40:46.792 --> 40:49.055
their behavioral traits

40:49.142 --> 40:52.537
and, uh, guess what
I've been doing?

40:52.624 --> 40:54.539
Oh, you haven't.

40:56.192 --> 40:58.934
Glibness
and superficial charm?

40:59.021 --> 41:02.068
- Check.
- You flatter me.

41:02.155 --> 41:05.593
- Grandiose sense of self-worth?
- You betcha.

41:05.680 --> 41:09.031
'Cunning and manipulative,
poor behavioral controls'

41:09.118 --> 41:12.600
failure to accept responsibility
for own actions.

41:12.687 --> 41:15.690
So I, uh, I cross-referenced
all of my observations

41:15.777 --> 41:19.651
with your history as a thief
and a con artist

41:19.738 --> 41:23.785
and, uh,
congratulations, Jane.

41:23.872 --> 41:26.048
'According to the score'

41:26.135 --> 41:30.357
you are a clinical psychopath.

41:30.444 --> 41:32.272
Wow.

41:32.359 --> 41:35.144
Well...certainly explains a lot.

41:36.537 --> 41:38.234
Now I know what
I'm dealing with

41:38.321 --> 41:40.672
so I'll adjust accordingly.

41:40.759 --> 41:42.151
As you should.

41:47.156 --> 41:48.418
Lisbon.

41:51.857 --> 41:53.772
Everything alright?

41:53.859 --> 41:55.948
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

41:56.035 --> 41:57.950
I like our new boss.

41:58.037 --> 41:59.908
I think we'll work
very well together.

42:01.954 --> 42:03.651
Would you like some tea?

42:03.738 --> 42:05.348
I'm tired.
I'm gonna go home.

42:06.611 --> 42:08.743
I made a pot.

42:08.830 --> 42:11.267
Alright.
I'll take one to go.

42:11.354 --> 42:13.574
I heard you got your man.

42:13.661 --> 42:16.882
As did you. Nice work.

42:16.969 --> 42:19.275
You think I'm
an antisocial personality?

42:19.362 --> 42:21.364
Yeah. Sure. Who isn't?

42:25.020 --> 42:27.675
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.
