00:00.360 --> 00:01.753
<i>Previously on "The Good Doctor"...</i>

00:01.755 --> 00:03.313
<i>We had the clinic at the hospital.</i>

00:03.313 --> 00:06.648
Come back as President, and...
and we'll re-open it.

00:06.673 --> 00:08.532
We need to go to HR and break up.

00:08.532 --> 00:10.999
I have accepted
your explanation and report.

00:11.001 --> 00:12.035
Thank you.

00:12.037 --> 00:13.135
But I don't believe it.

00:14.421 --> 00:16.938
Traditionally, you don't get to
lead surgeries until fourth year.

00:16.940 --> 00:18.106
That will be changing.

00:18.108 --> 00:21.004
When the right surgery
comes along, it'll be yours.

00:21.478 --> 00:23.912
I want you to meet our new attending,

00:23.914 --> 00:25.180
Dr. Marcus Andrews.

00:25.182 --> 00:27.049
Pleasure to meet you.

00:27.051 --> 00:28.950
You had a date last night, didn't you?

00:28.952 --> 00:32.587
It was hard, uncomfortable, unpleasant,

00:32.589 --> 00:34.556
and I have no idea if she was happy,

00:34.558 --> 00:37.526
and I know <i>I</i> wasn't happy.

00:43.734 --> 00:45.934
I don't like when you do that.

00:45.936 --> 00:46.968
I know.

00:46.970 --> 00:48.336
But I did it anyway

00:48.338 --> 00:49.971
because you need to snap out of it.

00:50.617 --> 00:52.841
The moping... it accomplishes nothing.

00:52.843 --> 00:54.709
I'm not moping. I'm eating.

00:54.711 --> 00:56.144
Which is the only thing

00:56.146 --> 00:58.747
you're doing outside your room now.

00:58.749 --> 01:00.348
You didn't even come out to tell me

01:00.350 --> 01:01.783
to turn down the Talking Heads.

01:01.785 --> 01:04.052
It... didn't bother me.

01:04.054 --> 01:05.287
The walls were shaking.

01:05.289 --> 01:07.389
I'm surprised the cops didn't show up.

01:10.247 --> 01:12.294
You like Carly.

01:12.296 --> 01:14.396
You need to get back in the saddle.

01:14.398 --> 01:17.099
And luckily, you have
a totally awesome roomie

01:17.101 --> 01:18.433
who's here to help you.

01:18.435 --> 01:21.736
I'm not going on any more dates.

01:21.738 --> 01:24.739
Shaun... everyone gets it.

01:24.741 --> 01:26.007
Dating is stressful.

01:26.009 --> 01:28.510
But being alone is worse.

01:28.512 --> 01:29.678
I'm not alone.

01:29.680 --> 01:32.814
I have you. I have Dr. Glassman.

01:32.816 --> 01:34.249
Yeah, friends are great,

01:34.251 --> 01:36.051
but everyone needs a special friend.

01:36.053 --> 01:37.552
I don't.

01:37.554 --> 01:38.553
Shaun...

01:38.555 --> 01:41.123
I'm not like everyone!

01:48.966 --> 01:51.566
No one is like everyone.

01:51.568 --> 01:53.555
We're all unique.

01:54.238 --> 01:57.453
But we're also the same.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:13.157 --> 02:14.422
I had rent control.

02:14.424 --> 02:16.858
The only way for them to jack the rent

02:16.860 --> 02:19.594
is to get me out,
so they just make up a reason.

02:19.596 --> 02:22.097
Said that I was
playing my music too loud.

02:23.132 --> 02:25.734
And the all-night parties,
the fighting with the neighbors,

02:25.736 --> 02:28.537
the wandering around the parking
lot without any clothes on?

02:28.539 --> 02:30.405
I had a robe on!

02:30.407 --> 02:31.573
And I wasn't wandering.

02:31.575 --> 02:33.441
I was trying to take the trash out,

02:33.443 --> 02:35.076
but they moved the damn bins.

02:36.045 --> 02:37.345
It was windy.

02:37.347 --> 02:40.938
Mom, you were clearly
off your meds and drinking.

02:42.031 --> 02:43.318
Okay.

02:43.320 --> 02:44.982
"Was."

02:45.556 --> 02:48.235
It was a temporary setback.

02:48.725 --> 02:51.326
Okay, nobody's perfect,
but it is all under control now.

02:51.328 --> 02:52.961
People with things under control

02:52.963 --> 02:54.829
don't show up at
their daughter's at 1:00 a.m.

02:54.831 --> 02:56.298
looking for a place to stay.

02:56.300 --> 02:59.301
I will be out of your hair
before you even know.

02:59.303 --> 03:00.569
Two weeks.

03:00.571 --> 03:01.703
Three... tops.

03:01.705 --> 03:02.904
One!

03:02.906 --> 03:05.106
I don't have time
to babysit a grown woman.

03:05.108 --> 03:07.242
Well, it's three weeks
until the end of the month.

03:07.244 --> 03:08.343
You at least owe me that.

03:08.345 --> 03:09.578
No, I don't, actually.

03:09.580 --> 03:10.879
<i>One</i> week.

03:13.984 --> 03:15.483
We need some help over here!

03:15.485 --> 03:18.320
Male, 30s, gaping 10-centimeter
laceration to his left cheek.

03:18.322 --> 03:20.689
Probable fractured
temporal bone, maxilla,

03:20.691 --> 03:22.424
- definitely shattered mandible.
- What happened?

03:22.426 --> 03:23.558
He tried to stop some creeper

03:23.560 --> 03:24.859
from groping a woman on the subway.

03:24.861 --> 03:27.329
Maniac ended up bashing his skull
in with some kid's skateboard.

03:27.331 --> 03:29.798
Wheels broke off, and the metal axle...

03:29.800 --> 03:30.865
did that.

03:30.867 --> 03:32.100
Okay, we need to secure his airway.

03:32.102 --> 03:33.335
His mouth is filling up with blood.

03:33.337 --> 03:34.536
Intubation cart.

03:34.538 --> 03:36.738
He has a through-and-through oral defect,

03:36.740 --> 03:38.173
and the mandible is crushed.

03:38.175 --> 03:39.307
We need hemostats.

03:39.309 --> 03:40.342
The woman?

03:40.344 --> 03:41.843
She's fine.

03:41.845 --> 03:44.212
Cops arrived, tased the dude,
took him away in cuffs.

03:44.214 --> 03:45.981
Everybody's fine except for the hero.

03:47.083 --> 03:48.516
We're gonna need to intubate
through the neck.

03:48.518 --> 03:52.053
Betadine, scalpel,
6-0 tube to place surgical cric.

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

04:07.370 --> 04:09.571
Could you do me a huge favor and
take this up to Lim's office?

04:09.573 --> 04:10.639
- Sure.
- I'm running late.

04:10.641 --> 04:12.307
No problem.

04:12.309 --> 04:13.275
Melendez is waiting.

04:13.277 --> 04:14.709
Sorry, I had to help Kellan

04:14.711 --> 04:16.478
with a biology project this morning.

04:16.480 --> 04:17.846
What's in the box?

04:17.848 --> 04:19.748
Ducati throw pillow.

04:19.750 --> 04:21.765
You really think you can
bribe Lim with a pillow?

04:21.767 --> 04:23.157
I'm not bribing her. I'm being nice.

04:23.159 --> 04:24.919
She's starting a new job in a new office.

04:24.921 --> 04:27.289
Where she'll decide who gets
the first lead surgery.

04:27.291 --> 04:28.790
I'm not stupid enough to think

04:28.792 --> 04:30.725
I can influence her decision with a gift.

04:31.438 --> 04:34.763
But it never hurts to have a
good relationship with your boss.

04:34.765 --> 04:36.631
And it's a damn cool pillow.

04:39.403 --> 04:42.070
Hey.

04:42.072 --> 04:44.439
No signs of any post-op infection.

04:44.441 --> 04:46.741
There's also no sign
your surgery did any good.

04:46.743 --> 04:48.376
Tom.

04:49.779 --> 04:51.046
How often is he vomiting?

04:51.048 --> 04:52.647
After every feeding.

04:52.649 --> 04:53.982
Okay.

04:53.984 --> 04:55.016
Shh.

04:56.585 --> 04:59.154
This is obviously not
the outcome we had hoped for,

04:59.156 --> 05:02.223
but a pyloric stenosis
requires a cautious approach.

05:02.225 --> 05:03.391
If we're too aggressive...

05:05.028 --> 05:07.095
It's okay, buddy. I got you.

05:07.097 --> 05:09.130
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

05:10.133 --> 05:12.634
Our baby is in pain. He can't eat.

05:12.636 --> 05:14.602
And you don't seem to have any clue why.

05:16.972 --> 05:19.374
I would be upset, too,
if I were in your position.

05:19.376 --> 05:20.709
But you're wrong.

05:20.711 --> 05:23.378
We need to conduct some tests
to confirm, but I am confident

05:23.380 --> 05:25.413
it's just a matter of going back in

05:25.415 --> 05:27.315
and making a tiny adjustment.

05:27.727 --> 05:29.017
Your son's in good hands.

05:29.985 --> 05:31.481
Thank you.

05:31.922 --> 05:33.521
I'm sorry. I'm just...

05:33.523 --> 05:34.989
A father who loves his son.

05:34.991 --> 05:36.925
You've got nothing to apologize for.

05:44.101 --> 05:45.633
That was impressive.

05:46.669 --> 05:48.269
Get an abdominal ultrasound to confirm

05:48.271 --> 05:50.839
it's just an incomplete pyloromyotomy.

05:54.643 --> 05:56.444
You're wasting your ass-kissing.

05:56.446 --> 05:58.313
First surgery isn't his decision.

05:58.315 --> 06:01.316
No. He's just the one <i>sleeping</i>
with the one making that decision.

06:04.921 --> 06:08.990
Pupils are equal and reactive.

06:08.992 --> 06:10.812
Do you know where you are?

06:12.828 --> 06:14.396
And do you know how you ended up here?

06:17.166 --> 06:19.601
Josh, you have multiple fractures

06:19.603 --> 06:21.202
in your cheek and jaw,

06:21.204 --> 06:24.339
and a large piece
of your cheek tissue, skin,

06:24.341 --> 06:26.975
and underlying muscle was torn off.

06:26.977 --> 06:30.044
You're going to need
extensive reconstructive surgery

06:30.046 --> 06:31.880
to save your jaw function.

06:31.882 --> 06:35.016
You need to read these consent forms.

06:35.018 --> 06:38.353
And if you have any questions,
write them on this pad.

06:38.355 --> 06:41.556
Was the woman on the subway
a friend of yours?

06:45.461 --> 06:46.628
He's a fool.

06:46.630 --> 06:49.964
Trying to prove how macho
you are can get you killed.

06:49.966 --> 06:52.834
Clamp the branch
of the inferior alveolar.

06:57.106 --> 07:00.175
So, you would just stand by?

07:00.177 --> 07:01.676
Let a woman get groped?

07:02.912 --> 07:05.346
Apply manual compression.
Try and close the fracture gap.

07:06.034 --> 07:08.349
You help every homeless drug addict

07:08.351 --> 07:09.584
you see on the subway?

07:09.586 --> 07:10.919
I don't.

07:10.921 --> 07:12.220
And neither does Browne,

07:12.222 --> 07:14.856
which is why she ought not
get so self-righteous.

07:14.858 --> 07:16.090
Yes.

07:16.092 --> 07:19.060
I help my patients
to the best of my ability

07:19.062 --> 07:20.795
because it's meaningful,

07:20.797 --> 07:23.598
and to me, the downside
is purely financial.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.700
For friends, I'll risk a little bit more,

07:25.702 --> 07:28.652
but the only people
I'm risking life and limb for

07:28.654 --> 07:30.271
are my family.

07:30.273 --> 07:32.073
Someone gropes my wife on the subway,

07:32.075 --> 07:33.341
they're gonna get whupped.

07:35.744 --> 07:37.879
This isn't gonna work.

07:37.881 --> 07:39.848
The mandibular ramus
is just too shattered,

07:39.850 --> 07:41.649
and I can't get adequate stabilization.

07:41.651 --> 07:43.952
We can't do any skin or muscle grafts

07:43.954 --> 07:45.854
if we can't fix the skeletal structures.

07:45.856 --> 07:49.057
Alloplastic augmentation
to bridge the gap?

07:49.059 --> 07:50.725
The span is too wide.

07:58.268 --> 07:59.734
We're gonna have to wire him shut.

08:02.071 --> 08:03.771
Wake him up.

08:03.773 --> 08:05.340
He should know he's never gonna talk

08:05.342 --> 08:07.008
or eat solid food again.

08:13.919 --> 08:15.919
_

08:16.496 --> 08:18.731
Forever.

08:28.710 --> 08:30.409
Do you have any questions?

08:34.081 --> 08:35.534
I'm sorry.

08:41.645 --> 08:47.235
_

08:58.284 --> 08:59.818
The Cantrells want a new surgeon.

09:02.048 --> 09:03.943
What can you tell me
about the first surgery?

09:05.052 --> 09:06.718
Is this an M&M review?

09:07.907 --> 09:09.374
Not yet.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.561
Is it possible...

09:13.563 --> 09:15.855
you may have been
a little too aggressive?

09:15.857 --> 09:17.023
Cut too deeply?

09:17.025 --> 09:18.779
Are you really asking me that?

09:18.781 --> 09:20.418
I need to know.

09:23.673 --> 09:25.215
I definitely didn't go too deep.

09:25.700 --> 09:27.197
Great.

09:27.199 --> 09:29.402
We'll talk to the Cantrells.

09:31.257 --> 09:32.291
Audrey.

09:34.147 --> 09:35.614
Is this weird for you?

09:37.965 --> 09:39.731
A little. You?

09:39.756 --> 09:41.623
I'm trying not to let it be.

09:42.456 --> 09:43.489
Good.

09:43.738 --> 09:44.943
Me too.

09:49.356 --> 09:50.368
Hello.

09:50.370 --> 09:54.393
I'm here to pick up artificial
dermal regeneration templates.

09:54.395 --> 09:55.433
Let me get it.

09:55.435 --> 09:56.629
Hey, Shaun.

09:57.937 --> 09:59.838
I heard what happened to the guy.

09:59.863 --> 10:00.962
Sounds horrible.

10:00.987 --> 10:02.620
Is he gonna be okay?

10:02.870 --> 10:06.872
He won't be able to eat
or speak normally ever again.

10:07.955 --> 10:08.955
Thank you.

10:08.980 --> 10:10.012
Shaun.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.972
You seem a bit uncomfortable.

10:14.955 --> 10:16.855
If it has anything to do with our date,

10:16.880 --> 10:19.914
I just want you to know,
I had a really good time...

10:20.121 --> 10:22.188
and hope we can do it again.

10:27.080 --> 10:30.363
I had... a horrible time...

10:31.092 --> 10:35.027
and... don't want to do that ever again.

10:47.281 --> 10:49.047
Extensive swelling.

10:49.072 --> 10:51.873
But within the acceptable range
of post-op edema.

10:51.898 --> 10:53.698
The very top of the range.

10:53.723 --> 10:56.323
I think maybe Melendez did go too deep,

10:56.357 --> 10:57.790
injured the pylorus.

10:57.792 --> 10:58.808
Well?

10:59.500 --> 11:01.233
The swelling is within
the acceptable range

11:01.258 --> 11:02.357
for a post-op edema.

11:04.731 --> 11:06.565
Got your muffins. Delicious.

11:06.567 --> 11:07.667
I'm glad you liked them.

11:07.669 --> 11:08.701
I did.

11:08.703 --> 11:09.902
Just kinda surprised

11:09.904 --> 11:11.904
you thought I could be bought
with baked goods.

11:11.906 --> 11:14.640
We're not trying to buy you off
with muffins or a pillow.

11:14.642 --> 11:15.741
Someone got me a pillow?

11:18.566 --> 11:21.981
No. I wanted to show you my
support for your promotion.

11:22.290 --> 11:24.482
You're all gonna lead
surgeries... hundreds of them.

11:24.484 --> 11:26.652
So it doesn't matter
who does anything first.

11:26.654 --> 11:29.121
The only thing that matters
is that you do it right.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.001
So, what was in the box?

11:36.026 --> 11:37.692
Sample marketing pamphlets.

11:37.717 --> 11:38.983
My buddy owns a print shop,

11:39.008 --> 11:40.741
asked me to give Lim some samples.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.075
Well played.

11:43.237 --> 11:44.470
But it's all moot anyway.

11:44.472 --> 11:46.172
It doesn't matter who goes first.

11:46.174 --> 11:47.339
Right.

11:48.354 --> 11:50.945
Just so I'm clear,
that "right" was sarcastic, right?

11:51.024 --> 11:52.090
Right.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.419
Hey.

12:00.421 --> 12:02.555
Since when does the President

12:02.557 --> 12:04.183
need to stock his own shelves?

12:04.185 --> 12:06.668
When it's a free clinic
and you want it done right.

12:09.022 --> 12:10.072
Thank you.

12:10.097 --> 12:13.082
Have you ever had sex in the office?

12:13.107 --> 12:14.506
I'm not gonna answer that.

12:14.531 --> 12:17.028
First of all,
it's embarrassing if I say yes,

12:17.053 --> 12:19.220
and it's even more embarrassing
if I say no.

12:19.426 --> 12:20.959
I take the fifth.

12:20.984 --> 12:22.249
If we're gonna get married,

12:22.274 --> 12:23.807
I need to know all your naughty...

12:23.832 --> 12:25.899
I brought us lunch.

12:25.924 --> 12:27.624
I know what you each like.

12:30.384 --> 12:32.818
Dr. Melendez is not
just our best surgeon.

12:32.820 --> 12:35.046
He's one of the tops
in the entire country,

12:35.071 --> 12:37.205
with the expertise to know
that the best way

12:37.230 --> 12:39.697
to avoid a truly bad outcome
in this procedure

12:39.722 --> 12:41.655
is to err on the side of caution.

12:43.744 --> 12:45.611
- W-We hear all that.
- We do.

12:45.636 --> 12:47.703
And we really appreciate you
taking the time

12:47.728 --> 12:49.094
to explain everything.

12:51.430 --> 12:54.499
But we would just... be more comfortable

12:54.524 --> 12:56.758
having someone else take over from here.

12:56.783 --> 12:58.149
You do understand?

12:59.092 --> 13:00.459
Of course.

13:01.388 --> 13:02.555
I assume you'd be okay

13:02.580 --> 13:04.613
if <i>I</i> perform Braden's second surgery?

13:05.952 --> 13:07.912
Eh... the Chief of the department?

13:07.914 --> 13:09.221
Eh...

13:09.223 --> 13:10.756
Absolutely.

13:10.758 --> 13:12.158
Thank you, Doctor.

13:12.160 --> 13:13.225
Of course.

13:18.921 --> 13:20.387
Nobody likes dating.

13:20.389 --> 13:22.689
It's awkward and uncomfortable.

13:22.691 --> 13:23.857
It's expensive.

13:23.859 --> 13:25.592
Ah. That's why you proposed
after two dates?

13:25.594 --> 13:26.894
To save money?

13:26.896 --> 13:29.296
I proposed after two dates
because after one date,

13:29.298 --> 13:31.465
I realized how much
I loved being around you

13:31.467 --> 13:34.191
and how much fun we'd have together.

13:34.193 --> 13:37.604
He's right, Shaun,
'cause the fun can be so fun.

13:39.287 --> 13:41.354
That didn't happen to me.

13:45.780 --> 13:47.748
I have to go to surgery.

13:47.750 --> 13:49.416
Shaun.

13:49.418 --> 13:51.385
Whenever you're ready, you'll try again.

13:56.791 --> 13:59.116
- What?
- Whenever he's ready?

13:59.201 --> 14:01.067
He's got to go at his own pace.

14:01.163 --> 14:03.313
He needs to be pushed.

14:03.338 --> 14:04.437
I'm not gonna push him.

14:04.462 --> 14:06.695
A man doesn't push another man
into a date.

14:06.720 --> 14:07.986
He pushed <i>you.</i>

14:08.070 --> 14:09.570
Shaun doesn't know any better.

14:09.572 --> 14:11.093
If you want him to find love,

14:11.095 --> 14:13.895
he <i>literally</i> needs to be pushed into it.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.586
Literally?

14:15.611 --> 14:17.144
Shaun's not like other men.

14:17.169 --> 14:19.300
Oh, he easily admits he's wrong?

14:19.868 --> 14:22.469
He easily changes course?

14:23.764 --> 14:27.334
If you don't talk to him,
is anything gonna change?

14:30.592 --> 14:33.106
No good deed goes unpunished.

14:33.415 --> 14:35.415
Why does it always work out that way?

14:35.440 --> 14:36.539
It doesn't.

14:36.872 --> 14:39.529
Most good deeds get rewarded.

14:39.969 --> 14:41.935
And what do you base that on, Murphy?

14:41.937 --> 14:44.438
Certainly not the news or the Forbes 500.

14:44.440 --> 14:45.606
Or the Bible.

14:45.608 --> 14:47.841
I base it on neuroscience.

14:47.843 --> 14:51.432
Bad outcomes just implant deeper
in our cerebral cortex.

14:51.457 --> 14:53.123
So, evolution agrees with me.

14:53.148 --> 14:55.882
Our brains encourage us to be selfish.

14:55.907 --> 14:57.006
Yes.

14:57.031 --> 14:59.065
Which makes it strange

14:59.090 --> 15:01.724
that people keep being unselfish.

15:01.749 --> 15:02.781
<i>You</i> were.

15:05.360 --> 15:07.223
You saved my job.

15:07.248 --> 15:10.216
And now you're an attending
instead of the President.

15:12.106 --> 15:13.373
Screws and wire ligature.

15:18.773 --> 15:20.307
We're not doing this.

15:21.509 --> 15:22.989
We can do better.

15:24.180 --> 15:26.046
There is no other procedure.

15:28.327 --> 15:29.993
We'll invent one.

15:36.437 --> 15:38.270
Truce during surgery.

15:39.107 --> 15:40.706
Fair. What about procedures?

15:40.731 --> 15:42.334
Imaging is fair game.

15:42.336 --> 15:43.882
Anything invasive, we go to our corners.

15:43.907 --> 15:45.740
Crap. I left my keys in my locker.

15:45.742 --> 15:48.276
- Losing my mind. I'll see you tomorrow.
- Night.

15:50.680 --> 15:53.765
What about a muscle
graft from the temporalis?

15:53.767 --> 15:57.085
That wouldn't address
deep mucosa or bone.

15:57.087 --> 16:00.729
Unless we took
an osseocutaneous free flap

16:00.730 --> 16:02.563
from the radial forearm.

16:02.565 --> 16:04.098
We'd need approximately 2 inches

16:04.100 --> 16:05.967
and could use the natural concavity of...

16:05.969 --> 16:08.036
And he could lose the use of his hand.

16:08.038 --> 16:10.553
That seems like a reasonable trade-off.

16:10.555 --> 16:12.707
I'm not telling this guy
that we can restore his speech

16:12.709 --> 16:14.676
and all it'll cost is his hand.

16:14.678 --> 16:16.334
Because he's a hero?

16:17.112 --> 16:18.846
What he did has nothing to do with it.

16:18.848 --> 16:20.381
It's what <i>we</i> can do that matters.

16:20.383 --> 16:22.617
What we can do is what we were doing.

16:22.619 --> 16:24.052
That's the protocol.

16:24.054 --> 16:27.422
Aren't we risking more damage
by leaving him in an ICU bed

16:27.424 --> 16:30.091
while we try to invent a new treatment?

16:31.794 --> 16:34.529
How about attaching two free flaps

16:34.531 --> 16:36.965
on vessels on either side of his neck?

16:36.967 --> 16:39.200
Heard from Claire you're having
an all-hands-on-deck sesh.

16:39.202 --> 16:40.601
Happy to join.

16:40.603 --> 16:42.203
Good. How about Park?

16:42.205 --> 16:43.535
He left.

16:43.537 --> 16:45.974
Said he had a thing with his son.

16:45.976 --> 16:49.277
Thankfully, I don't have kids,
so extra hours... not a problem.

16:49.279 --> 16:52.714
Have you considered an
allograft augmentation or a...

16:52.716 --> 16:55.483
Heard y'all were working late,
so I got some coffee.

16:56.586 --> 16:58.219
Any way I can help?

17:03.726 --> 17:06.127
I want to talk about
our meeting with the Cantrells.

17:06.128 --> 17:08.329
On date night?

17:08.330 --> 17:10.932
Can it wait... 10 1/2 hours?

17:11.305 --> 17:12.467
I guess.

17:12.882 --> 17:14.147
Thank you.

17:15.637 --> 17:17.905
Have you ever been to The French Laundry?

17:17.906 --> 17:18.906
No.

17:18.907 --> 17:20.942
We should do a weekend in Napa.

17:20.944 --> 17:23.578
I know this great little B&B
just south of St. Helena...

17:23.579 --> 17:25.380
It's not about the Cantrells.

17:25.382 --> 17:27.238
It's about what you said to them.

17:27.751 --> 17:30.084
Has it been 10 1/2 hours already?

17:30.086 --> 17:33.054
I "erred on the side of caution."

17:33.056 --> 17:34.889
Caution is a good thing.

17:34.891 --> 17:36.524
Err isn't.

17:36.526 --> 17:38.860
I didn't err... not at all.

17:38.862 --> 17:40.561
I was going to bat for you.

17:40.563 --> 17:42.063
I think that maybe you're so afraid

17:42.065 --> 17:43.564
of appearing to favor your boyfriend

17:43.566 --> 17:44.866
that you're overcompensating.

17:44.868 --> 17:46.768
Given I think you may have erred,

17:46.770 --> 17:48.803
I'd say I was incredibly supportive.

17:48.805 --> 17:50.772
In which case, you went against
your better professional judgment

17:50.774 --> 17:51.906
to favor your boyfriend.

17:51.908 --> 17:55.076
So, I'm too supportive
or not supportive enough?

17:57.346 --> 18:00.815
Should I change the reservation
to two tables for one?

18:02.786 --> 18:06.387
I've had plenty of first dates
that were <i>actual</i> disasters.

18:06.389 --> 18:08.623
Took one woman to a Coyotes game,

18:08.625 --> 18:10.191
saw four minutes of it,

18:10.193 --> 18:11.692
spent the rest of the night in the ER

18:11.694 --> 18:15.463
while she got 17 stitches
after being hit by a puck.

18:16.154 --> 18:18.132
We got married eight months later.

18:19.168 --> 18:21.202
Then you divorced her.

18:21.542 --> 18:23.071
It was worth it.

18:27.177 --> 18:28.643
We don't have a choice.

18:28.645 --> 18:31.179
Evolution needs us to propagate,

18:31.181 --> 18:34.382
so it gives us a shot of happiness

18:34.384 --> 18:37.351
every now and again
to suck us in like idiots.

18:38.455 --> 18:40.188
To keep us in a game

18:40.190 --> 18:42.490
that we know we're gonna lose
almost every time.

18:42.492 --> 18:46.160
Because the upside's like...

18:46.162 --> 18:47.995
nothing else.

18:49.198 --> 18:50.331
Love.

18:53.302 --> 18:56.737
But if Shaun really
doesn't need to play, then...

18:56.739 --> 18:58.272
good for him.

18:59.038 --> 19:02.510
We've officially turned into
an episode of "The Bachelor."

19:03.612 --> 19:05.213
Everyone go home.

19:05.215 --> 19:06.380
I'm not tired.

19:06.382 --> 19:07.982
<i>I</i> am.

19:07.984 --> 19:09.083
No.

19:09.085 --> 19:11.786
There are still
a number of possibilities.

19:11.788 --> 19:14.655
Murphy, you are smart
and you're creative,

19:14.657 --> 19:18.359
but there are things you can't do.

19:20.095 --> 19:23.198
You can't do miracles.
You can't fix the unfixable.

19:44.554 --> 19:46.521
Hey, baby.

19:47.891 --> 19:50.491
You work way too hard.

19:50.493 --> 19:52.627
Yes, I do.

19:52.629 --> 19:54.662
Uh... let me get you something to eat,

19:54.664 --> 19:58.132
'cause I made some pulled pork
and some peanut coleslaw.

19:58.134 --> 19:59.233
No, thanks, Mom.

19:59.235 --> 20:01.202
Did you find a place?

20:01.204 --> 20:04.172
I saw one, but it was nasty.

20:04.174 --> 20:05.506
Y-You must be hungry.

20:05.508 --> 20:07.074
You saw <i>one,</i>

20:07.481 --> 20:10.111
and then you came home and cooked?

20:12.648 --> 20:14.081
Yes.

20:14.083 --> 20:17.283
I came home and cooked dinner
for my daughter.

20:17.754 --> 20:19.654
I'm trying, Claire.

20:19.656 --> 20:21.322
Okay, I'm taking my meds.

20:21.324 --> 20:23.124
I'm seeing Dr. Donovan.

20:23.126 --> 20:25.693
I am doing my best.

20:27.530 --> 20:29.628
I've heard that before.

20:33.570 --> 20:35.136
You got six days.

20:57.227 --> 20:59.994
Shaun, you need sleep.

20:59.996 --> 21:02.296
Your neurons will be sparkier
in the morning.

21:02.298 --> 21:06.701
There are 640 muscles
and 206 bones in the body,

21:06.703 --> 21:08.936
but only 284 and 72 of those

21:08.938 --> 21:10.771
are of sufficient size for our grafts,

21:10.773 --> 21:16.043
but that still leaves
20,448 possible permutations.

21:16.045 --> 21:19.424
It's not unfixable
until I rule out every...

21:19.426 --> 21:23.117
So, some anatomy problem,
you won't give up on,

21:23.119 --> 21:24.719
but after one date,

21:24.721 --> 21:29.523
you think you've explored
all the possible permutations?

21:29.525 --> 21:33.227
Stop distracting me.

21:33.229 --> 21:34.729
I'm distracting you?

21:34.731 --> 21:36.664
By talking about you?
By talking about love?

21:36.666 --> 21:37.670
Yes.

21:37.672 --> 21:40.835
I... I need to concentrate.

21:40.837 --> 21:41.902
Okay.

21:41.904 --> 21:43.237
I'll shut up.

21:43.239 --> 21:44.338
You're still talking.

21:44.340 --> 21:45.773
Good night, Shaun.

21:45.775 --> 21:47.241
You're still...

21:47.243 --> 21:49.310
We only have 206 bones?

21:49.312 --> 21:51.178
- Still talking.
- Oh...

21:55.417 --> 21:57.418
Yes.

22:21.149 --> 22:22.650
Shaun?

22:25.213 --> 22:26.947
I think we should talk.

22:26.949 --> 22:28.482
So did Lea.

22:28.484 --> 22:31.218
But I have to find a solution
for an oromandibular defect

22:31.220 --> 22:33.154
that doesn't involve titanium plates,

22:33.156 --> 22:37.491
356 of our muscles, or 134 of our bones.

22:37.493 --> 22:39.393
I don't think you never want
to see me again.

22:39.395 --> 22:43.061
I have to find a solution
for an oromandibular...

22:43.063 --> 22:44.532
We have to talk.

22:44.534 --> 22:46.400
You owe me that much.

22:55.877 --> 22:58.813
Why do I owe you that much?

22:58.815 --> 23:01.447
Because I thought we had a nice time.

23:02.285 --> 23:04.533
And I thought you were a nice guy...

23:04.954 --> 23:07.288
an honest guy...
and I still think you are,

23:07.290 --> 23:09.223
and I'm confused about how you feel

23:09.225 --> 23:11.425
and about how I feel about how you feel,

23:11.427 --> 23:13.327
and I just need to talk about it.

23:16.431 --> 23:18.299
So, if you have any feelings
for me at all,

23:18.301 --> 23:20.034
you'll help me understand.

23:30.947 --> 23:32.686
Okay.

23:34.416 --> 23:37.191
My little sister, Andie, has autism.

23:37.587 --> 23:39.735
We're not all the same.

23:40.256 --> 23:41.528
I know.

23:42.613 --> 23:47.094
I think growing up with Andie
helps me understand you.

23:48.597 --> 23:51.365
But it also makes me wonder about myself.

23:51.663 --> 23:55.002
And did I date you to prove something?

23:56.377 --> 23:58.539
Did I date you to...

23:58.541 --> 24:01.776
somehow make things better for Andie?

24:03.779 --> 24:05.880
I don't think I did, but...

24:09.919 --> 24:11.886
My point is...

24:12.393 --> 24:14.522
I have questions, too, Shaun.

24:16.359 --> 24:18.726
Trying to figure out what we want

24:18.728 --> 24:21.429
and why we want it and is it good for us

24:21.431 --> 24:22.997
are good questions.

24:24.366 --> 24:28.035
And they can't all be answered
over one dinner.

24:36.646 --> 24:38.179
I have to go.

25:05.475 --> 25:07.141
Murphy...

25:08.511 --> 25:11.378
I've... I've got it!

25:11.380 --> 25:12.513
I've got it!

25:14.425 --> 25:16.999
We take a vascularized free flap

25:17.001 --> 25:19.393
and suture it
to the facial artery and vein,

25:19.395 --> 25:21.259
then flip up the pectoralis.

25:23.509 --> 25:25.174
It's a great idea.

25:26.615 --> 25:27.949
We're not doing it.

25:29.017 --> 25:30.818
It's never been tried before.

25:30.820 --> 25:33.921
Risk 1... graft failure brings infection

25:33.923 --> 25:36.090
and he loses the other half of his face.

25:36.092 --> 25:38.159
Risk 2... sepsis and he dies.

25:38.161 --> 25:39.393
Risk 3...

25:39.395 --> 25:40.628
Yeah, yeah, yeah, risk whatever.

25:40.630 --> 25:41.796
We do the standard procedure,

25:41.798 --> 25:43.164
the guy never speaks or eats again.

25:46.034 --> 25:48.069
Dr. Murphy, could you please
give us a minute?

25:58.413 --> 26:00.114
Why do you want to do this?

26:00.116 --> 26:02.650
You've been my boss for a few hours,

26:02.652 --> 26:05.720
and you're already
questioning my motivations?

26:05.722 --> 26:07.388
You fell on your sword for Shaun,

26:07.390 --> 26:09.924
and your reward for your act of heroism

26:09.926 --> 26:11.826
was getting fired.

26:11.828 --> 26:14.431
And now you're back here,
answerable to me.

26:15.832 --> 26:17.865
I imagine you've been asking yourself

26:17.867 --> 26:19.367
if it was worth it.

26:24.440 --> 26:27.241
Your issues with the procedure are valid,

26:27.243 --> 26:29.443
but at least let me put them
before the patient.

26:29.445 --> 26:30.711
He'll say yes.

26:30.713 --> 26:32.446
I won't sugarcoat the risks.

26:32.448 --> 26:34.315
He'll say yes anyway.

26:34.317 --> 26:36.584
He <i>wants</i> to believe things will work out.

26:36.586 --> 26:38.553
That's why he's a hero.

26:38.555 --> 26:40.916
Sometimes the hero loses.

26:40.941 --> 26:43.627
Which is why he's got to learn
when to stand back

26:44.694 --> 26:47.094
when there's nothing he can do to help.

26:51.434 --> 26:53.620
Are you going to order me to stand back?

26:57.807 --> 26:59.287
No.

27:05.281 --> 27:06.614
Hey, Shaun?

27:06.616 --> 27:07.982
You got a minute?

27:07.984 --> 27:09.517
Okay.

27:09.519 --> 27:12.486
Debbie wanted me to talk to you.

27:12.823 --> 27:14.922
To tell you...

27:14.924 --> 27:17.024
not to give up on love.

27:21.630 --> 27:23.397
Don't give up on love.

27:24.001 --> 27:25.199
Okay.

27:25.201 --> 27:27.802
Do you want me to let her know
you told me?

27:27.804 --> 27:29.203
Yes, please.

27:32.208 --> 27:33.541
Hey, Shaun?

27:33.543 --> 27:36.477
I know this, uh, dating thing
can be scary.

27:36.479 --> 27:38.012
You're good at dating.

27:38.014 --> 27:41.349
Well, before Debbie,
the last time I went on a date,

27:41.351 --> 27:44.585
"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go"
was the big hit.

27:44.587 --> 27:47.355
'Cause a-a-after Maddie and the divorce,

27:47.357 --> 27:50.124
I kind of shut down for a while.

27:50.126 --> 27:51.993
Yeah, I... and it felt better

27:51.995 --> 27:55.162
to be in a place
where I couldn't get hurt.

27:55.164 --> 27:57.398
But then, last year, I got my diagnosis,

27:57.400 --> 27:59.000
I thought I was gonna die,

27:59.002 --> 28:01.769
and Debbie came into my life,
and I said to myself,

28:01.771 --> 28:03.771
"I-I-I don't want to be safe anymore."

28:03.773 --> 28:05.039
You know?

28:05.041 --> 28:08.003
I want to... I want to...
I want to feel alive.

28:08.378 --> 28:11.012
And... And if I get hurt, I get hurt.

28:11.014 --> 28:12.513
That's part of the deal.

28:13.682 --> 28:17.018
Morgan says it's biological,

28:17.020 --> 28:18.920
that it doesn't make sense.

28:18.922 --> 28:20.421
Morgan's right.

28:20.423 --> 28:22.123
So <i>I'm</i> right?

28:22.125 --> 28:24.525
No. No.

28:26.128 --> 28:27.695
Look, i...

28:27.697 --> 28:29.864
it's wonderful, this love thing.

28:29.866 --> 28:31.999
Why should it make any sense?

28:32.001 --> 28:34.735
When I think about the reasons
I-I'm in love with Debbie,

28:34.737 --> 28:37.204
okay, she's... she's kind, she's funny,

28:37.206 --> 28:39.106
she's... she's loving.

28:39.108 --> 28:41.242
But that's not it. Not really.

28:42.678 --> 28:44.111
Don't tell her this,

28:44.113 --> 28:45.780
but there are other people in the world

28:45.782 --> 28:47.181
that are kinder, that are funnier,

28:47.183 --> 28:49.083
that are more loving than she is,

28:49.085 --> 28:52.486
but she makes me happy...
just being around her.

28:52.488 --> 28:54.822
It makes absolutely no sense,

28:54.824 --> 28:57.152
but I wouldn't trade it for anything.

29:08.861 --> 29:09.994
Okay.

29:16.912 --> 29:19.080
I have an ethical dilemma.

29:20.515 --> 29:22.316
I was going through state regulations

29:22.318 --> 29:23.489
for medical staff...

29:23.491 --> 29:25.733
specifically, residents...

29:25.735 --> 29:28.456
and their new guidelines
have raised an issue for me.

29:28.458 --> 29:30.825
The state caps residents
at 80 hours a week,

29:30.827 --> 29:33.227
but I don't think that's nearly enough.

29:33.229 --> 29:35.830
I work over 100, and I don't
plan on cutting back,

29:35.832 --> 29:38.366
so I'm wondering how I should be
reporting my hours.

29:38.368 --> 29:41.221
Park offered to co-write a paper with me.

29:41.804 --> 29:43.137
What a suck-up.

29:43.139 --> 29:44.405
I said yes.

29:44.407 --> 29:46.741
It's an interesting case.
It <u>should</u> be written up.

29:46.743 --> 29:47.808
So he's...

29:47.810 --> 29:49.677
Gonna do a lot of work for nothing.

29:49.679 --> 29:51.773
Except for the good
of the medical community.

29:52.582 --> 29:54.515
And I'm gonna tell you what I told <i>him...</i>

29:54.517 --> 29:56.384
if you come to me with one more favor,

29:56.386 --> 29:57.585
one more humblebrag,

29:57.587 --> 30:00.521
if I suspect either of you
have your lips puckered,

30:00.523 --> 30:02.223
you're going to the bottom of the list.

30:02.225 --> 30:03.491
Yes, ma'am.

30:09.093 --> 30:10.564
Dr. Lim?

30:11.508 --> 30:13.401
Do you ever think about what it means,

30:13.403 --> 30:14.902
me doing all this?

30:14.904 --> 30:16.904
Means you've underestimated me.

30:17.340 --> 30:19.106
Maybe.

30:19.108 --> 30:21.572
But it also means that I care.

30:21.574 --> 30:24.845
That getting the first surgery
means something to me...

30:24.847 --> 30:25.980
enough for me to go out

30:25.982 --> 30:28.015
and really overspend on designer desserts

30:28.017 --> 30:30.051
and then to spend even more time

30:30.053 --> 30:32.186
trying to make them look homemade.

30:32.188 --> 30:34.321
If I'm putting that much effort
into muffins,

30:34.323 --> 30:35.489
imagine how hard I'll work

30:35.491 --> 30:37.224
to make the most of this opportunity

30:37.226 --> 30:38.759
if it's given to me.

30:46.401 --> 30:49.703
With considerable
physio and speech therapy,

30:49.705 --> 30:53.207
this graft would allow you to not
only chew and swallow whole foods,

30:53.209 --> 30:55.420
but it would enable you to talk again.

30:55.462 --> 30:56.669
_

30:57.479 --> 31:01.148
It's an untested procedure
with not-insignificant risks.

31:01.150 --> 31:02.583
If the graft doesn't take,

31:02.585 --> 31:05.519
more skin and bone could become infected,

31:05.521 --> 31:07.254
possibly necrotic.

31:09.120 --> 31:11.120
_

31:12.694 --> 31:14.662
We need to know you understand.

31:14.664 --> 31:16.630
It's an experimental procedure.

31:16.632 --> 31:19.366
In addition to all of
the usual surgical risks,

31:19.368 --> 31:21.268
there are all of the unknowns...

31:21.270 --> 31:24.371
bleeding out, permanent graft loss,

31:24.373 --> 31:26.207
stroke...

31:26.209 --> 31:27.711
death.

31:33.115 --> 31:34.501
_

31:44.249 --> 31:49.596
_

31:51.441 --> 31:53.341
Good for you, Josh.

31:53.536 --> 31:55.269
Get him prepped.

31:57.273 --> 31:58.439
Okay.

31:58.441 --> 32:01.041
Infuse carbon dioxide.

32:04.514 --> 32:07.047
Grasping duodenum
just distal of the pylorus.

32:10.386 --> 32:12.286
Huh. Look at that.

32:12.698 --> 32:14.355
That's not good.

32:15.323 --> 32:16.807
Page Dr. Melendez.

32:18.200 --> 32:19.901
An intussusception.

32:19.903 --> 32:21.826
The telescoped bowel
is causing a blockage.

32:21.828 --> 32:25.085
The baby had two unrelated
conditions causing the same symptom.

32:25.087 --> 32:27.097
We only know about the second condition

32:27.122 --> 32:28.688
because of the first surgery.

32:28.690 --> 32:31.491
Treatment protocol is a barium enema,

32:31.493 --> 32:33.059
but not for someone Braden's age.

32:33.061 --> 32:34.928
An <i>air</i> enema might work.

32:34.930 --> 32:36.763
Unless the intestine's torn.

32:37.965 --> 32:40.033
Morgan, reposition the scope

32:40.035 --> 32:42.202
to get a better look
at the intestinal wall

32:42.204 --> 32:43.937
around the intussusception site.

32:47.375 --> 32:49.309
There's too much swelling
and edema to be sure.

32:49.311 --> 32:51.536
With the risk of infection,
we don't have time to find out.

32:51.538 --> 32:53.427
You're gonna have to open him up.

32:53.429 --> 32:55.048
<i>You</i> should.

32:55.050 --> 32:56.983
The Cantrells made their wishes clear.

32:56.985 --> 32:59.319
Well, that's when I made them
think you'd erred,

32:59.321 --> 33:00.820
which you did not...

33:00.822 --> 33:02.373
not on the side of caution...

33:02.375 --> 33:03.798
not at all.

33:04.426 --> 33:06.059
We do the surgery together.

33:06.634 --> 33:07.994
Who's the lead?

33:07.996 --> 33:09.396
I think you know.

33:09.398 --> 33:10.730
Pulling rank?

33:10.732 --> 33:11.898
Absolutely.

33:11.900 --> 33:15.643
As Chief of Surgery, I designate <i>you.</i>

33:16.071 --> 33:17.437
It's like a puzzle.

33:17.439 --> 33:19.172
You secure to the artery,

33:19.174 --> 33:22.509
then the vessel just won't quite
stretch to the vein.

33:22.511 --> 33:26.279
You could mobilize the recipient vessel.

33:27.149 --> 33:28.582
Repeat that, Dr. Browne.

33:28.607 --> 33:31.975
Mobilize the recipient vessel
to create more slack.

33:36.724 --> 33:38.058
You saw Carly again.

33:38.060 --> 33:39.192
How was it?

33:39.194 --> 33:40.877
Inconvenient.

33:41.196 --> 33:43.029
But despite her intrusion,

33:43.031 --> 33:46.032
I was still able
to concentrate on medicine.

33:46.034 --> 33:48.068
That wasn't an intrusion.
That was a date.

33:48.070 --> 33:49.602
It was walking.

33:49.604 --> 33:52.672
Walking with someone you like
who likes you, too,

33:52.674 --> 33:54.107
is a non-date date.

33:54.109 --> 33:56.009
Some of the best dates that I have had

33:56.011 --> 33:58.445
did not involve flowers
and restaurant reservations.

33:58.447 --> 33:59.979
Just...

33:59.981 --> 34:02.916
sharing a bag of chips
and sitting on a couch.

34:04.418 --> 34:05.985
Secured.

34:05.987 --> 34:07.487
Remove clamps.

34:09.322 --> 34:11.991
Blood flow to and from graft.

34:11.993 --> 34:14.239
Let's move on to the pectoralis flap.

34:14.241 --> 34:16.295
Blood pressure's dropping.

34:16.297 --> 34:18.565
Okay. Heart rate is up.

34:18.567 --> 34:20.300
Push IV fluids,
give epinephrine 1 milligram,

34:20.302 --> 34:21.801
then start a drip.

34:23.137 --> 34:25.170
There's intestinal wall perforation.

34:25.172 --> 34:26.206
Repairable?

34:27.507 --> 34:29.708
There's too much tissue damage.

34:29.710 --> 34:30.909
Infection?

34:30.911 --> 34:32.245
No sign of peritonitis,

34:32.246 --> 34:34.214
but we'll need to remove
this section of bowel.

34:38.553 --> 34:40.386
- He's tachy.
- Hypotensive.

34:40.388 --> 34:42.563
Push vasopressors and antibiotics.

34:43.024 --> 34:44.687
Check an iSTAT hematocrit, ABG.

34:44.712 --> 34:46.458
Give two units PRBCs.

34:46.460 --> 34:48.561
I don't see any major bleeding.

34:48.563 --> 34:50.830
Push more fluids, start an inotrope.

34:50.831 --> 34:53.632
Check all vessels we worked on
for clots with the Doppler.

34:53.635 --> 34:54.734
Okay.

35:00.675 --> 35:02.909
Large clot in the carotid.

35:02.911 --> 35:04.444
Clamps back on,

35:04.446 --> 35:06.112
performing carotid arteriotomy.

35:06.114 --> 35:07.881
Will try to aspirate out the clot.

35:07.883 --> 35:09.282
Stand by with heparin.

35:15.790 --> 35:17.757
Carotid clot removed.

35:23.632 --> 35:24.967
EEG looking good.

35:25.951 --> 35:28.768
Resuming pectoralis flap dissection.

35:30.204 --> 35:32.113
Good work, everybody.

36:05.079 --> 36:06.879
Go ahead... say something.

36:07.948 --> 36:09.213
Yeah, you can talk.

36:09.215 --> 36:11.050
Maybe not too much at first...

36:11.052 --> 36:12.662
give the jaw a chance to heal.

36:16.157 --> 36:17.456
Thank you.

36:22.029 --> 36:24.196
On behalf of all of us,
you're very welcome.

36:25.699 --> 36:29.468
The woman who was being accosted
when you intervened is here.

36:29.470 --> 36:30.569
Is she all right?

36:30.571 --> 36:31.904
She's not here as a patient.

36:31.906 --> 36:34.873
She's been... waiting to see you.

36:35.454 --> 36:36.595
Okay?

36:45.685 --> 36:47.152
Hello.

36:47.554 --> 36:49.054
Hey.

36:49.689 --> 36:52.524
I am so sorry this happened.

36:52.944 --> 36:54.445
Me too.

36:55.446 --> 36:57.329
You look...

36:57.331 --> 37:00.199
When the swelling goes down,
he'll look a lot better.

37:00.535 --> 37:02.067
It's okay.

37:02.069 --> 37:04.236
My face was never my fortune.

37:07.407 --> 37:08.793
What made you do it?

37:09.794 --> 37:11.877
Why did you step in?

37:14.115 --> 37:15.514
I don't know.

37:17.450 --> 37:19.084
You needed help.

37:26.694 --> 37:28.927
Olivia, by the way.

37:28.929 --> 37:29.962
Josh.

37:29.964 --> 37:31.662
We'll let you two get acquainted.

37:39.507 --> 37:42.741
It didn't matter who got
the first lead surgery... to <i>me.</i>

37:42.743 --> 37:45.477
But it's recently
been brought to my attention

37:45.479 --> 37:47.980
how much it might mean to some of <i>you.</i>

37:47.982 --> 37:50.916
Seems I'd forgotten
how important this decision is

37:50.918 --> 37:53.285
when you've been
dreaming about it for years.

37:53.287 --> 37:56.455
You're all excellent candidates,
each deserving,

37:56.457 --> 37:58.624
and will all get your turn.

37:58.968 --> 38:00.459
Starting with Dr. Browne.

38:00.461 --> 38:01.694
Yes!

38:02.762 --> 38:04.129
Thank you.

38:11.404 --> 38:13.472
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

38:15.875 --> 38:17.309
What the hell was that?

38:17.311 --> 38:18.977
I was happy for a colleague.

38:18.979 --> 38:20.679
You weren't campaigning for you to win.

38:20.681 --> 38:23.182
You were campaigning for me to lose.

38:23.184 --> 38:25.984
Do you dislike me that much?

38:25.986 --> 38:27.986
I just wouldn't want you supervising me

38:27.988 --> 38:29.455
as Chief Resident.

38:29.457 --> 38:31.190
You'd be a nightmare of a boss.

38:40.079 --> 38:41.880
Shaun.

38:44.270 --> 38:46.305
Dr. Lim thought my motives
for fighting this hard

38:46.307 --> 38:48.640
for this patient were miscalculated.

38:50.343 --> 38:51.710
She was right.

38:52.105 --> 38:54.513
We <i>shouldn't</i> have saved his face?

38:54.515 --> 38:57.416
We have limited resources,
and we're even more limited

38:57.418 --> 39:00.385
in our personal capacity
to determine who is deserving,

39:00.387 --> 39:02.988
so we make a choice
to treat everyone the same.

39:02.990 --> 39:06.525
So why did you treat
this patient differently?

39:07.160 --> 39:09.127
Because I was angry.

39:10.029 --> 39:13.042
I made a sacrifice to save you.

39:13.567 --> 39:16.802
I lost my job,
I took a substantial demotion.

39:16.804 --> 39:18.670
And I thought I was a fool.

39:18.672 --> 39:21.673
The cost was way too high.

39:21.675 --> 39:23.876
I resented you, and I...

39:23.878 --> 39:25.778
kind of resented the universe.

39:29.015 --> 39:30.749
But today...

39:31.751 --> 39:34.219
...you made me proud of my sacrifice.

39:35.895 --> 39:36.961
Thank you.

39:40.393 --> 39:42.027
You're welcome.

39:44.230 --> 39:46.398
Very few things
that are worthwhile in life

39:46.400 --> 39:49.268
come without a cost, Shaun.

40:09.423 --> 40:10.789
This is tricky.

40:11.825 --> 40:14.459
I feel like we were just tested
and both of us failed.

40:16.797 --> 40:18.190
But...

40:18.599 --> 40:20.250
we'll get better at this.

40:32.746 --> 40:34.146
Hey, honey.

40:34.148 --> 40:37.082
I'll make you a plate, and you
can take it to your room.

40:37.084 --> 40:38.450
Thanks.

40:40.286 --> 40:41.820
I saw three more apartments today.

40:41.822 --> 40:43.322
One was kind of nice,

40:43.324 --> 40:46.609
but it's not ready
until a week from this Tuesday,

40:46.611 --> 40:49.361
which puts me over your deadline
by three days.

40:52.298 --> 40:53.532
No.

40:55.001 --> 40:56.268
Three days? Come on.

40:56.270 --> 40:58.570
You can stay here.

40:58.572 --> 41:03.008
For a little while,
until you're a bit better.

41:03.010 --> 41:05.377
But you <i>have</i> to stay on your meds.

41:05.379 --> 41:07.212
And keep away from other drugs
and alcohol.

41:07.214 --> 41:09.147
I'm testing your urine every two days.

41:09.149 --> 41:11.884
Don't miss <i>any</i> appointments
with Dr. Donovan.

41:13.186 --> 41:14.553
Can you live with that?

41:30.437 --> 41:32.271
Do you have a couch?
