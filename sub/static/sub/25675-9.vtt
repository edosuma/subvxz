00:05.464 --> 00:07.216
<i>What brings you home?</i>

00:07.216 --> 00:09.843
<i>- Kidnapping.</i>
- Oh, fuck!

00:09.843 --> 00:12.387
<i>Nothing else to call
what they did to that kid.</i>

00:12.387 --> 00:14.640
<i>Do you think
that's why you came back?</i>

00:14.640 --> 00:16.475
<i>'Cause it reminded you?</i>

00:16.475 --> 00:18.268
<i>Henry?</i>

00:18.268 --> 00:20.729
<i>No frostbite.
You been inside somewhere?</i>

00:24.316 --> 00:26.235
I've had a beautiful experience.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.530
- And I heard it.
- What?

00:30.530 --> 00:33.408
<i>You're saying my dad
believed he could hear God?</i>

00:33.408 --> 00:35.410
Other heres. Other nows.

00:35.410 --> 00:38.622
All possible pasts,
all possible presents...

00:38.622 --> 00:40.541
the schisma is
the sound of the universe

00:40.541 --> 00:42.668
trying to reconcile them.

00:42.668 --> 00:45.587
<i>"Never again
let him see the light of day."</i>

00:47.089 --> 00:49.132
<i>That's what God told me.</i>

00:49.132 --> 00:50.717
You know me.

00:50.717 --> 00:53.220
I don't know anything about you.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.597
You do.
And I know you.

00:55.597 --> 00:57.683
Out there in the woods.

00:57.683 --> 00:59.184
That's where you died.

01:02.229 --> 01:03.647
Do you hear it?

01:03.647 --> 01:04.940
We have to go to the woods.

01:04.940 --> 01:06.608
Why did you ask for me?

01:06.608 --> 01:07.943
<i>Young man...</i>

01:07.943 --> 01:09.403
who are you?

01:09.403 --> 01:10.821
Henry Deaver.

01:16.910 --> 01:20.998
<i>God turned His back
on this place.</i>

01:25.919 --> 01:29.590
<i>Abandoned us...
that's what people say.</i>

01:32.259 --> 01:35.721
<i>Or they say
He's punishing us for our sins,</i>

01:35.721 --> 01:37.639
<i>like Sodom and Gomorrah.</i>

01:41.268 --> 01:43.854
<i>You remember
the helicopter crash.</i>

01:46.690 --> 01:50.277
<i>How about the school bus?</i>

<i>People say, "It wasn't me!"</i>

02:10.964 --> 02:12.758
<i>"It was this place."</i>

02:17.346 --> 02:22.351
<i>And the thing is...</i>

02:22.351 --> 02:23.894
<i>they're right.</i>

02:25.771 --> 02:29.191
<i>When I was a boy
my mother told me a story...</i>

02:29.191 --> 02:31.526
<i>about resurrection.</i>

02:32.819 --> 02:36.365
<i>She was young...</i>

02:36.365 --> 02:39.451
<i>alone...</i>

02:39.451 --> 02:43.288
<i>and convinced the Devil
had a hold of me.</i>

02:43.288 --> 02:45.624
<i>And maybe he did.</i>

02:49.127 --> 02:53.090
<i>Or maybe he had a hold
of my mother.</i>

03:09.815 --> 03:12.734
<i>But then...</i>

03:12.734 --> 03:15.362
<i>a miracle happened.</i>

03:22.411 --> 03:27.082
<i>The Lord, He saved
both of us that day.</i>

03:27.082 --> 03:29.292
<i>He brought me back
from the dead,</i>

03:29.292 --> 03:31.753
<i>like His only son.</i>

03:31.753 --> 03:34.714
<i>I dedicated the rest of my life
to His grace,</i>

03:34.714 --> 03:37.926
<i>to fighting this great battle,</i>

03:37.926 --> 03:40.345
<i>to hearing His voice.</i>

03:40.345 --> 03:43.181
<i>"Let me stand athwart
the door," I told Him.</i>

03:43.181 --> 03:44.808
<i>But God,</i>

03:44.808 --> 03:48.186
<i>He doesn't take requests.</i>

03:48.186 --> 03:52.524
<i>So I waited... for years...</i>

03:54.985 --> 03:56.862
<i>for instructions.</i>

04:03.493 --> 04:06.246
<i>And then one day...</i>

04:08.290 --> 04:13.044
<i>one terrible day...</i>

04:13.044 --> 04:14.671
<i>God answered.</i>

05:33.792 --> 05:37.879
<i>Continuity.
It's hard work.</i>

05:37.879 --> 05:39.422
<i>We don't notice we're doing it,</i>

05:39.422 --> 05:41.216
<i>but we are placing events
in sequence</i>

05:41.216 --> 05:43.093
<i>so that our lives make sense.</i>

05:44.636 --> 05:47.722
<i>When continuity is interrupted,</i>

05:47.722 --> 05:50.350
<i>everything starts to slide.</i>

05:50.350 --> 05:52.769
<i>Higher-order functions
become challenging.</i>

05:52.769 --> 05:56.147
<i>Reason and judgment erode.</i>

05:56.147 --> 05:59.526
<i>Can't manage finances,
drive a car,</i>

05:59.526 --> 06:01.945
<i>planning and problem-solving
gone.</i>

06:01.945 --> 06:06.616
<i>And ultimately, confusion
with time and space.</i>

06:06.616 --> 06:11.413
That is the story
of Alzheimer's disease.

06:11.413 --> 06:14.875
Or rather, it has been...
until now.

06:19.588 --> 06:21.464
This here is Puck.

06:21.464 --> 06:24.843
Now, Puck was born with
a strong genetic predisposition

06:24.843 --> 06:28.722
for FCD...
Feline Cognitive Dysfunction.

06:28.722 --> 06:31.182
Very similar to Alzheimer's
pathologically.

06:31.182 --> 06:35.896
Apathy, confusion,
spatial disorientation.

06:35.896 --> 06:39.566
That was before
we put our hippocampal implant

06:39.566 --> 06:41.192
in his brain.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.908
But now, Puck here is a miracle.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.951
He remembers where
his food bowl is,

06:49.951 --> 06:53.538
what time the sexy tabby next
door is basking on the patio.

06:53.538 --> 06:57.250
Puck is finally in command
of his arch-narrative again.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.128
You see, Alzheimer's
jumbles your story.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.339
And, um...

07:02.339 --> 07:04.841
well, it turns off the lights.

07:04.841 --> 07:07.886
We turn the lights back on.

07:07.886 --> 07:09.554
You actually said that

07:09.554 --> 07:10.972
with a straight face?

07:10.972 --> 07:12.307
Yeah, I mean,

07:12.307 --> 07:14.684
we could be profitable
in three years.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.186
That is why people like me

07:16.186 --> 07:19.022
do not let people like you
handle the money.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.441
Hey, it's the 20th today,
isn't it?

07:21.441 --> 07:23.735
- Aren't you supposed to...
- Yes, tomorrow.

07:23.735 --> 07:26.071
- Tomorrow? OK.
- Patience is a...

07:26.071 --> 07:28.865
It's not my strong suit.

07:31.034 --> 07:32.410
Hold on.

07:35.747 --> 07:37.666
Hey. Is... Is everything OK?

07:37.666 --> 07:39.501
<i>Not exactly.</i>

07:39.501 --> 07:41.419
<i>I've got some bad news.</i>

07:41.419 --> 07:43.004
Is it Mom?

07:43.004 --> 07:44.964
<i>Ruth is fine.</i>

07:44.964 --> 07:46.883
<i>It's about your dad.</i>

08:17.414 --> 08:20.875
You know, uh, I'll just
walk from here, thank you.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.970
<i>What do we say...</i>

11:20.638 --> 11:21.806
to heartbreak?

11:24.058 --> 11:25.768
<i>The Book says,</i>

11:25.768 --> 11:29.647
"Death is swallowed up
in victory."

12:21.199 --> 12:23.159
Hi.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.745
Sorry to disturb you.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.248
- Are you...
- Brigid.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.124
Market must be crazy
if guys like you

12:30.124 --> 12:32.085
are looking at a dump like that.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.878
Two other speculators
were in from Portland

12:33.878 --> 12:35.171
just yesterday.

12:35.171 --> 12:36.798
You guys scan the obits, right?

12:36.798 --> 12:38.216
- Uh...
- 'Cause I heard that

12:38.216 --> 12:40.218
he actually did it
out on the lake.

12:40.218 --> 12:41.928
Like...

12:41.928 --> 12:44.722
Ya know. Not in the house,
if that makes a difference.

12:44.722 --> 12:47.517
- I'm not a speculator.
- Oh.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.185
You probably don't remember me,
but, um...

12:49.185 --> 12:52.563
- Bridge!
- Yeah, I'm out here!

12:55.566 --> 12:56.651
Hey.

12:59.529 --> 13:00.697
Molly.

13:02.365 --> 13:04.033
Henry Deaver?

13:12.709 --> 13:15.086
- There you go.
- Thank you.

13:15.086 --> 13:17.672
- Hey, Molly.
- Hi.

13:17.672 --> 13:19.716
Here we go.

13:21.217 --> 13:23.386
- Look at you.
- What?

13:23.386 --> 13:27.181
- You're like the mayor.
- Please. Council Chair.

13:27.181 --> 13:29.100
It's real power.

13:29.100 --> 13:30.852
You used to be so shy
when we were kids.

13:30.852 --> 13:32.895
People change, ya know?

13:32.895 --> 13:34.856
Your sister seems
about the same.

13:34.856 --> 13:36.983
Yeah, I guess
the lucky ones change.

13:36.983 --> 13:39.652
The unlucky ones
cheat on their husbands

13:39.652 --> 13:41.612
at a middle school
math conference

13:41.612 --> 13:43.531
and end up couch surfing
at their sister's house

13:43.531 --> 13:44.991
- for a year.
- Ouch.

13:47.118 --> 13:49.871
Hmm. How's your mom?

13:49.871 --> 13:53.958
- Um, Sarasota.
- Oh.

13:53.958 --> 13:57.503
You know who she lives with?
Alan Pangborn.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.297
- The old sheriff?
- Yeah.

13:59.297 --> 14:04.052
They had a kinda... star-crossed
thing back in the day.

14:04.052 --> 14:06.054
He was the one who convinced her
to leave my dad.

14:06.054 --> 14:07.889
A few days after
we ran off to Boston,

14:07.889 --> 14:09.724
Alan shows up at the door.

14:09.724 --> 14:12.185
And he, um...
takes good care of her now.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.355
Um, she has Alzheimer's.

14:16.355 --> 14:20.401
Oh, no. Henry, I'm so sorry.
I didn't know.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.779
She got it pretty young.

14:22.779 --> 14:25.448
Started forgetting
her Norse demigods,

14:25.448 --> 14:28.367
then the rest went.

14:28.367 --> 14:30.787
But she's the reason why
I got into the field, of course.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.330
Of course.

14:32.330 --> 14:34.665
One more thing I owe her.

14:37.126 --> 14:40.421
She did the right thing
getting you out of here.

14:52.683 --> 14:54.602
Can I ask you something?

14:54.602 --> 14:56.145
Yeah.

14:56.145 --> 15:00.358
My dad was nuts
for who knows how long...

15:00.358 --> 15:03.319
so why'd he
blow his head off now?

15:03.319 --> 15:05.321
Did you ever talk to him?

15:06.614 --> 15:09.408
Oh...

15:09.408 --> 15:11.119
after he left the church,

15:11.119 --> 15:13.621
I don't think
he talked to anyone.

15:17.041 --> 15:19.836
D-Do you remember
the flashlights?

15:19.836 --> 15:22.547
Of course I do.

15:22.547 --> 15:24.590
You always knew when I was up.

15:24.590 --> 15:27.260
But even when my light was off,

15:27.260 --> 15:29.137
you always knew.

15:29.137 --> 15:32.140
Y-You knew a lot of things.

15:32.140 --> 15:35.726
Yeah, I was a... real busybody.
I always have been.

15:38.688 --> 15:40.898
- It's really good seeing you.
- Yeah.

15:45.987 --> 15:47.989
- Good night.
- Good night.

15:56.497 --> 16:00.376
<i>- So you really OK?</i>
- I'm fine.

16:00.376 --> 16:03.838
Yeah.
Everything's fine.

16:03.838 --> 16:06.674
Look at the bright side.
We're new homeowners.

16:06.674 --> 16:08.050
<i>Stop.</i>

16:09.927 --> 16:11.804
<i>- Aw, shit.</i>
- What?

16:11.804 --> 16:13.514
<i>Lights just blew a fuse.</i>

16:13.514 --> 16:16.142
I don't even know
where the box is.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.643
Hold on.

16:27.069 --> 16:29.197
I found a flashlight.

16:29.197 --> 16:32.325
<i>I hope you don't
have to stay there too long.</i>

16:32.325 --> 16:34.202
Hey, it's... it's tomorrow.

16:34.202 --> 16:37.705
Today is tomorrow, the 21st,
so, uh...

16:37.705 --> 16:40.708
- No. It hasn't come yet.
- <i>Then you're late.</i>

16:40.708 --> 16:45.296
- <i>By one day.</i>
- Yeah, but, uh, I mean,

16:45.296 --> 16:47.298
you're usually on time.

16:47.298 --> 16:49.550
Just take a pregnancy test.

16:49.550 --> 16:52.345
<i>Ha! Did I mention
it's been one day?</i>

16:54.472 --> 16:58.100
The first month of trying,
yeah, I know,

16:58.100 --> 17:02.188
but, um, I'm just...

17:02.188 --> 17:03.898
I have a feeling.

17:05.523 --> 17:07.108
<i>Hey, I can't imagine</i>

17:07.108 --> 17:08.527
<i>what it's like
being in that house</i>

17:08.527 --> 17:10.905
<i>after all those years.</i>

17:10.905 --> 17:12.740
Yeah.

17:14.282 --> 17:16.493
<i>Just call me in the morning, OK?</i>

17:17.744 --> 17:19.538
I love you, Marren.

17:19.538 --> 17:21.249
<i>I love you.</i>

17:41.477 --> 17:42.937
Let's see...

17:52.863 --> 17:53.990
No!

18:06.002 --> 18:08.004
When was the last time
you talked to your father?

18:09.797 --> 18:12.133
I don't know.

18:12.133 --> 18:13.801
When I was about his age.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.349
What is he saying?

18:21.475 --> 18:23.394
Not saying anything yet.

18:24.395 --> 18:26.647
I mean, besides your name.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.402
Henry Deaver?

18:33.279 --> 18:35.448
That's you, right?

18:56.260 --> 18:59.639
Did your dad ever touch you?

18:59.639 --> 19:00.890
What?

19:00.890 --> 19:04.101
No. Look, my dad was fucked up,

19:04.101 --> 19:05.936
but not like that.

19:05.936 --> 19:07.813
How <i>was</i> he fucked up?

19:11.317 --> 19:15.946
He, uh, thought he heard
the voice of God in the woods.

19:18.407 --> 19:21.035
He used to drag me out there
in the dead of night,

19:21.035 --> 19:22.536
middle of winter.

19:23.704 --> 19:26.415
March me around...

19:26.415 --> 19:28.209
hoping I'd hear it too.

19:29.502 --> 19:30.961
Did you?

19:46.769 --> 19:49.897
Hey, stop!
Come back here!

19:49.897 --> 19:51.357
Hey! Hey!

19:58.906 --> 20:01.450
It's OK. It's OK there.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.207
Where was he trying to go?

20:38.779 --> 20:41.907
<i>Forest fires
took near 1,000 acres.</i>

20:41.907 --> 20:44.368
<i>The drunk helicopter pilot
who killed...</i>

20:46.662 --> 20:48.372
<i>and in the town plaza.</i>

20:49.957 --> 20:52.293
<i>The school bus
and all those sweet children</i>

20:52.293 --> 20:53.836
<i>died on the track.</i>

22:08.452 --> 22:10.746
<i>This has been a curse
since the beginning,</i>

22:10.746 --> 22:12.581
<i>since those original
French settlers</i>

22:12.581 --> 22:15.835
<i>froze and starved 200 years ago.</i>

22:15.835 --> 22:17.795
<i>The only survivor, a young girl,</i>

22:17.795 --> 22:19.338
<i>reduced to cutting up and eating</i>

22:19.338 --> 22:21.215
<i>the corpses of her own family.</i>

22:21.215 --> 22:22.675
<i>Is that when it began?</i>

22:25.302 --> 22:28.514
<i>God turned His back
on this place.</i>

22:28.514 --> 22:30.140
<i>Abandoned us.</i>

22:30.140 --> 22:31.851
<i>That's what people say.</i>

22:31.851 --> 22:33.686
<i>Or they say He's punishing us...</i>

22:36.480 --> 22:39.275
<i>What if it's not just
one voice, but a choir?</i>

22:50.953 --> 22:53.831
<i>Toward the end
of the worst of it...</i>

22:53.831 --> 22:56.000
<i>the bad patch</i>

22:56.000 --> 22:57.501
<i>that we had that spring.</i>

22:57.501 --> 22:59.003
<i>Oh, sweet Lord in heaven...</i>

23:02.006 --> 23:03.591
<i>Spent hours out there
every night</i>

23:03.591 --> 23:05.551
<i>in those damn woods praying...</i>

23:06.844 --> 23:09.179
<i>tryin' to hear it.</i>

23:09.179 --> 23:11.390
<i>Thought if I could hear Him
again just once</i>

23:11.390 --> 23:13.642
<i>He'd tell me how to end this...</i>

23:13.642 --> 23:15.561
<i>end the bad patch.</i>

23:16.729 --> 23:19.857
<i>But... He didn't.</i>

23:19.857 --> 23:21.483
<i>Or I couldn't hear Him,</i>

23:21.483 --> 23:24.028
<i>I just wasn't listening
hard enough.</i>

23:26.113 --> 23:28.991
<i>But then I did hear something.</i>

23:30.534 --> 23:32.661
<i>I heard something
at the back door,</i>

23:32.661 --> 23:34.955
<i>this scritch-scratching,
somethin' trying to get in.</i>

23:34.955 --> 23:36.790
<i>This being a bad patch,</i>

23:36.790 --> 23:38.751
<i>I pull my Louisville Slugger
out of the closet,</i>

23:38.751 --> 23:41.045
<i>throw open that back door,</i>

23:41.045 --> 23:43.047
<i>and there he was.</i>

23:43.047 --> 23:45.299
<i>He looks at me.</i>

23:45.299 --> 23:47.843
<i>He looks at the bat,
just as scared as can be.</i>

23:47.843 --> 23:50.429
<i>Looks caught.
Can you blame him?</i>

23:50.429 --> 23:51.972
<i>He's between a man with a bat</i>

23:51.972 --> 23:54.516
<i>and those woods
he just came from.</i>

23:54.516 --> 23:58.103
<i>Well, I'll tell ya, he wasn't
the only one scared.</i>

23:58.103 --> 24:00.189
<i>I promise you,
I reached for the phone,</i>

24:00.189 --> 24:04.151
<i>I was gonna call the police,
Child Service, the cavalry,</i>

24:04.151 --> 24:07.237
<i>and then he starts saying,
"I heard it, Dad.</i>

24:07.237 --> 24:10.240
<i>It was so loud, Dad.
It was all around us,</i>

24:10.240 --> 24:12.159
<i>in my head, and it was too much.</i>

24:12.159 --> 24:14.620
<i>And then you were gone,
and then I was gone,</i>

24:14.620 --> 24:16.497
<i>and I woke up in the forest,</i>

24:16.497 --> 24:18.832
<i>but suddenly
there was no more snow,</i>

24:18.832 --> 24:22.670
<i>and then I walked into town
and it looked... different.</i>

24:22.670 --> 24:24.964
<i>Castle Rock, but different.</i>

24:24.964 --> 24:27.007
<i>And not one person
in town knew me."</i>

24:27.007 --> 24:29.385
<i>That's what he said,
not making a lick of sense,</i>

24:29.385 --> 24:31.720
<i>and then he tells me a story.</i>

24:31.720 --> 24:35.140
<i>He says he's my son. Henry.</i>

24:35.140 --> 24:37.101
<i>Adopted.</i>

24:37.101 --> 24:39.687
<i>He tells me a story
that the two of us</i>

24:39.687 --> 24:41.605
<i>went to pray in Castle Woods,</i>

24:41.605 --> 24:45.275
<i>that we were out there,
he says, to listen...</i>

24:45.275 --> 24:47.653
<i>for Him.</i>

24:47.653 --> 24:49.029
<i>And he heard it.</i>

24:49.029 --> 24:50.990
<i>He said he'd</i> really <i>heard it.</i>

24:50.990 --> 24:52.825
<i>No foolin' this time.</i>

24:52.825 --> 24:55.244
<i>None of his mother's trickery
and deceit.</i>

24:55.244 --> 24:57.955
<i>And there, right here,
he caught me,</i>

24:57.955 --> 24:59.915
<i>because who would know that?</i>

24:59.915 --> 25:03.419
<i>Who could possibly know that
that woman tried to trick me?</i>

25:06.672 --> 25:09.466
<i>Did I test him more?
Of course I did.</i>

25:09.466 --> 25:11.468
<i>I asked him how</i>

25:11.468 --> 25:15.139
<i>I like my eggs cooked
over the propane stove.</i>

25:15.139 --> 25:17.641
<i>The name we gave
to the bend and the view...</i>

25:17.641 --> 25:18.934
<i>he knew it.</i>

25:20.936 --> 25:22.646
<i>He knew it... all.</i>

25:23.939 --> 25:25.357
<i>And it...</i>

25:25.357 --> 25:27.568
<i>it felt like redemption.</i>

25:27.568 --> 25:29.236
<i>Like he'd been returned to me.</i>

25:29.236 --> 25:31.822
<i>Changed, but the same.</i>

25:31.822 --> 25:34.033
<i>Restored.</i>

25:34.033 --> 25:36.410
<i>My sweet Henry
back to me at last.</i>

25:40.414 --> 25:42.499
<i>And it was then...</i>

25:42.499 --> 25:45.419
<i>I realized what I'd done.</i>

25:46.962 --> 25:50.674
<i>I'd wished... not prayed, wished.</i>

25:50.674 --> 25:54.386
<i>Desired for this.
Yes, this.</i>

25:56.305 --> 25:57.890
<i>And here it was</i>

25:57.890 --> 26:00.768
<i>like I'd ordered it
off the damn TV.</i>

26:00.768 --> 26:04.897
<i>Well, we know just who that is,
don't we?</i>

26:04.897 --> 26:07.441
<i>Who gives you what you wish</i>

26:07.441 --> 26:09.526
<i>when you need it most,</i>

26:09.526 --> 26:12.362
<i>with just a string
or three attached.</i>

26:13.989 --> 26:16.617
<i>I'd been bought... bought cheap.</i>

26:16.617 --> 26:19.161
<i>This was no son of mine.</i>

26:25.584 --> 26:29.630
<i>In the blindness of desire
and my naked want</i>

26:29.630 --> 26:32.966
<i>I'd invited in the Deceiver.</i>

26:37.638 --> 26:41.642
I was just down the hill
from him this whole time.

26:41.642 --> 26:44.394
I knew what he was like.

26:44.394 --> 26:47.606
That's why I just...
tuned him out.

26:49.525 --> 26:53.654
The stuff he said
the kid told him about my mom.

26:55.906 --> 27:00.410
How she would tell me to lie
about hearing God in the woods

27:00.410 --> 27:03.288
to get him off my back.

27:03.288 --> 27:05.749
That happened.

27:08.836 --> 27:10.671
What are you saying?

27:13.132 --> 27:14.800
I don't know.

27:17.136 --> 27:20.264
Ohh. But Henry...

27:20.264 --> 27:22.140
listen to me.

27:22.140 --> 27:25.561
Those things
that he talked about...

27:25.561 --> 27:30.440
the helicopter going down,
the school bus crash...

27:30.440 --> 27:33.026
they happened decades ago.

27:37.739 --> 27:39.616
They go up to the 1400s.

27:42.578 --> 27:44.955
So he recorded this one...

27:46.415 --> 27:49.710
No, but that kid can't be more than 12.

27:53.255 --> 27:56.091
<i>There he stayed for years,</i>

27:56.091 --> 27:58.260
<i>so many years,</i>

27:58.260 --> 28:01.847
<i>and I grew old and even lonelier.</i>

28:01.847 --> 28:04.808
<i>There were moments
when I was weak.</i>

28:04.808 --> 28:06.935
<i>We shared Christmases
in that basement,</i>

28:06.935 --> 28:08.896
<i>Red Sox victories,</i>

28:08.896 --> 28:11.481
<i>I taught him to carve
perfect figurines from soap</i>

28:11.481 --> 28:14.234
<i>as I once did with my own boy.</i>

28:14.234 --> 28:17.613
<i>And yes, of course,
I almost let him out.</i>

28:17.613 --> 28:23.160
<i>Many times. Almost surrendered
to his story, his charms.</i>

28:23.160 --> 28:25.787
<i>I suppose if someone
is listening to this,</i>

28:25.787 --> 28:29.124
<i>maybe even Henry...
my Henry...</i>

28:29.124 --> 28:33.295
<i>then you know
I finally did surrender.</i>

28:33.295 --> 28:35.505
<i>But you listen to me, son.</i>

28:35.505 --> 28:38.967
<i>As long as that devil walks
the streets of Castle Rock,</i>

28:38.967 --> 28:41.136
<i>tragedy after tragedy
will pile up</i>

28:41.136 --> 28:43.096
<i>and men will turn on their own.</i>

28:43.096 --> 28:47.726
<i>Blood will run in the streets
until he is back in a cage.</i>

28:57.235 --> 28:59.613
I can find out
where they took him.

29:32.187 --> 29:33.939
What's goin' on?

30:03.635 --> 30:05.095
I know these guys.

30:16.523 --> 30:18.817
We think he did it.

30:25.657 --> 30:28.493
Seven people dead.

30:28.493 --> 30:31.079
- Ten still missing.
- Oh, my God.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.082
Has anyone seen the kid?

30:34.082 --> 30:37.085
They took him away.

30:37.085 --> 30:38.962
They think he did this.

30:49.431 --> 30:51.725
Thanks.

31:02.319 --> 31:04.237
Boy in the bed next to his

31:04.237 --> 31:05.447
says he found the lighter,

31:05.447 --> 31:07.491
saw him set his mattress on fire.

31:07.491 --> 31:09.993
How old is this kid?
Your witness.

31:09.993 --> 31:13.914
- Your boy's not denying it.
- Just let us talk to him, Jim.

31:13.914 --> 31:15.499
Henry's a doctor.

31:15.499 --> 31:18.960
This boy is obviously
traumatized.

31:18.960 --> 31:23.256
Henry just wants to help
however he can.

31:24.299 --> 31:26.051
I'm Molly.

31:27.135 --> 31:29.012
And this is Henry.

31:30.514 --> 31:33.266
Do you know... your name?

31:34.559 --> 31:38.688
Henry... Matthew...

31:38.688 --> 31:40.315
Deaver.

31:44.945 --> 31:47.864
Can you tell us how old you are?

32:03.421 --> 32:06.633
Here. These might help.

32:07.634 --> 32:09.803
OK. It's OK. Oh, sorry.

32:22.399 --> 32:24.943
Can we ask you
one more question?

32:28.488 --> 32:31.116
Did you start the fire in the hospital?

32:36.621 --> 32:38.123
Why?

32:39.541 --> 32:42.252
I...

32:42.252 --> 32:44.004
couldn't stop him.

32:46.423 --> 32:50.635
The boy... in the bed...

32:50.635 --> 32:52.637
next to mine. He was...

32:55.307 --> 32:57.267
He was too close.

32:57.267 --> 33:00.520
Too close to what?

33:11.489 --> 33:13.867
Oh, no...

33:21.958 --> 33:24.377
We have to go. To the woods.

33:24.377 --> 33:25.921
There's not much time left.

33:28.590 --> 33:31.134
<i>Do you hear it...
twinkling of an eye...</i>

33:31.134 --> 33:33.345
<i>trumpet will sound
and the dead will...</i>

33:33.345 --> 33:37.224
- Do you hear it now?
<i>- Twinkling of an eye...</i>

33:37.224 --> 33:39.434
<i>Together, together...</i>

33:48.985 --> 33:50.570
Your time's up.

33:50.570 --> 33:52.364
Gotta take him upstairs.

34:10.966 --> 34:14.344
He's been in a cage
for God knows how long.

34:14.344 --> 34:16.554
You can't just
toss him into another one!

34:16.554 --> 34:19.474
As the chairperson
of the city council,

34:19.474 --> 34:22.101
I will take full responsibility.

34:29.192 --> 34:30.694
What's goin' on?

34:30.694 --> 34:32.904
He's coming with us.

34:36.324 --> 34:39.786
CPS will be over tomorrow
morning to pick him up.

34:39.786 --> 34:42.038
The boy doesn't leave
your residence.

34:42.038 --> 34:45.417
Dennis will sweep your house
for weapons and incendiaries.

34:45.417 --> 34:46.918
- You understand?
- Yes.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.087
And he'll be right outside,
all night long.

34:49.087 --> 34:51.922
Kid's already tried to run once.

36:10.585 --> 36:12.545
We have to help him.

36:13.546 --> 36:15.590
What are you talking about?

36:17.801 --> 36:20.011
We have to take him...

36:20.011 --> 36:21.930
where he wants to go.

36:21.930 --> 36:23.264
Towards the sound.

36:23.264 --> 36:25.517
To the woods?

36:25.517 --> 36:27.060
For what?

36:30.230 --> 36:32.190
I don't know.

36:41.950 --> 36:44.327
Fuck! Fuck.

36:48.331 --> 36:51.376
Hey, hold on!

37:11.312 --> 37:13.857
Got eyes on the car.
They're on foot

37:13.857 --> 37:15.650
half-mile off the eastern side
of Castle Lake.

37:15.650 --> 37:16.943
<i>Copy that.</i>

38:05.867 --> 38:07.243
Police!
Stay where you are!

38:07.243 --> 38:09.829
Officer, everything is fine, OK?

38:09.829 --> 38:12.582
- Calm down.
- Get on the ground right now!

38:12.582 --> 38:14.459
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

38:14.459 --> 38:16.419
<i>Molly!</i>

38:31.601 --> 38:33.144
- Listen to me.
- Molly!

38:33.144 --> 38:35.480
Goddamnit, Molly, stop!

39:05.301 --> 39:07.136
<i>Goddamnit, Molly, stop!</i>

39:22.402 --> 39:24.904
- What the fuck?
- What the hell did you do?!

39:24.904 --> 39:28.366
Molly. Molly!

39:28.366 --> 39:31.744
I shot in the air. It was...
a fuckin' warning shot.

39:31.744 --> 39:33.830
It's OK. It's OK.

39:33.830 --> 39:35.123
Everything's gonna be OK.

39:35.123 --> 39:37.333
Call an ambulance!

39:37.333 --> 39:39.294
It's OK. It's OK.

39:40.962 --> 39:42.088
Help him.

39:47.302 --> 39:50.513
Help him. Help him.
Help him...

39:54.475 --> 39:56.561
Molly? Molly?

39:56.561 --> 39:58.688
<i>Molly?</i>

41:22.271 --> 41:23.481
Henry!

41:25.900 --> 41:28.486
Henry!

41:56.973 --> 42:01.853
I wandered around...
for days.

42:01.853 --> 42:04.647
I was trying to get back...

42:04.647 --> 42:06.107
and I couldn't.

42:08.359 --> 42:10.653
Then Lacy found me.

42:13.781 --> 42:16.034
Took me to Shawshank.

42:18.369 --> 42:20.997
Said he heard the call.

42:24.292 --> 42:26.252
Said I was the devil.

42:30.298 --> 42:32.675
You believe me, don't you?
