02:40.749 --> 02:42.250
In this term, you will be assessed

02:42.251 --> 02:44.250
on an original research project.

02:44.799 --> 02:46.170
You will work with
the person next to you

02:46.170 --> 02:48.070
on the topic of your choosing.

03:12.070 --> 03:13.630
See you next week, partner.

03:14.430 --> 03:15.440
This totally proves

03:15.440 --> 03:17.340
extraterrestrials seeded life on Earth.

03:17.340 --> 03:18.110
Why Earth?

03:18.110 --> 03:19.510
Why not Mars or Saturn?

03:19.510 --> 03:20.930
Because of the Goldilocks zone.

03:20.930 --> 03:22.800
- That's a "bear" faced lie.
- That's a dollar.

03:22.800 --> 03:23.710
Hey guys.

03:23.710 --> 03:24.510
Hey Jake.

03:26.400 --> 03:27.800
Hey guys, look, another sighting.

03:28.380 --> 03:30.320
Truth.wiki again Charles, really?

03:30.990 --> 03:32.280
More like the wackopedia.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.420
Charles, let's be logical for a moment.

03:34.420 --> 03:36.850
If advanced beings
with the ability to travel

03:36.850 --> 03:39.020
anywhere in the universe
actually exist...

03:39.020 --> 03:41.070
Why would they visit Brightwood?

03:41.070 --> 03:43.190
To make sure we're
not a threat, obviously.

03:43.190 --> 03:43.940
A threat?

03:43.940 --> 03:46.560
They have like warp drive
and interdimensional propulsion.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.700
Yeah, we have your mom's minivan.

03:48.700 --> 03:49.900
Definitely not a threat.

03:49.900 --> 03:51.600
Hey dude, will you get out of my bag?

03:53.850 --> 03:55.840
Where are the chips, Einstein?

03:55.850 --> 03:56.730
Leave it alone.

03:56.730 --> 03:58.570
It's a Wi-Fi amplifier, idiot.

03:58.570 --> 04:00.270
Wow, that's fascinating.

04:00.270 --> 04:01.500
Can it amplify this?

04:01.500 --> 04:03.060
You're a massive nerd.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.090
I need your skills again.

04:14.460 --> 04:16.300
You really suck at this.

04:16.300 --> 04:17.820
What do you want me to change it to?

04:17.829 --> 04:19.570
I don't know,
a B minus or something.

04:19.570 --> 04:20.810
Oh, come on!

04:20.810 --> 04:22.510
No waffles?

04:22.510 --> 04:24.470
This town sucks!

04:24.470 --> 04:25.800
I heard she got cancer.

04:25.801 --> 04:27.299
Who, Polly?

04:27.300 --> 04:30.620
I heard this one kid got it,
and his entire family died.

04:30.620 --> 04:33.060
They had like these boils and pus...

04:33.380 --> 04:34.930
Ow, what was that for?

04:34.930 --> 04:36.190
Dude!

04:36.290 --> 04:37.590
Oh.

04:40.840 --> 04:42.030
Sorry, man.

04:42.030 --> 04:43.620
I bet you miss him, huh?

04:44.570 --> 04:45.700
Sorry.

04:48.340 --> 04:50.060
Hey Mikey, check this out!

04:52.000 --> 04:54.310
Whoo! Wall and peace!

04:56.960 --> 04:58.450
Michael Emory...

04:58.450 --> 05:00.020
It's no use running, son.

05:04.360 --> 05:05.940
Allan Farraday.

05:05.950 --> 05:08.550
Here to rescue the world from the
horrors of street art?

05:08.550 --> 05:10.270
This is three, Mike.

05:10.270 --> 05:11.680
Three strikes.

05:11.680 --> 05:12.710
You got me.

05:12.710 --> 05:14.700
I give up, cuff me.

05:15.930 --> 05:17.140
Get in the car.

05:27.460 --> 05:29.110
You gonna take me in or what?

05:30.190 --> 05:31.730
I'm taking you home.

05:32.860 --> 05:35.040
No need to upset your mother today.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.990
We're all very fond of Jennifer,
aren't we?

05:37.990 --> 05:39.830
Well...

05:39.840 --> 05:41.250
Your mom's a good woman.

05:43.960 --> 05:45.130
Good morning, Doris.

05:45.140 --> 05:46.930
Mrs. Mercher, how are you today?

05:46.930 --> 05:49.600
Oh doctor, I'm dying!

05:49.603 --> 05:50.800
Mm-hmm.

05:52.070 --> 05:54.660
I'm crossing over.
I know I am.

05:54.660 --> 05:56.550
Reduce your caffeine intake

05:56.550 --> 05:58.540
and try to stay away from
processed foods.

05:58.540 --> 06:00.180
I don't have the cancer?

06:00.180 --> 06:01.790
Uh no, Mrs. Mercher,

06:01.790 --> 06:03.970
you're suffering from migraines again.

06:03.970 --> 06:05.920
I'm gonna send you for an eye exam.

06:07.360 --> 06:08.730
- Migraines?
- Mmm.

06:09.280 --> 06:11.500
Oh doctor, thank you.

06:11.500 --> 06:14.490
You really know how to
put an old lady at ease.

06:15.160 --> 06:16.850
- Thank you, doctor.
- Bye now.

06:21.290 --> 06:23.110
- Bye.
- Bye bye.

06:23.110 --> 06:25.030
I think you have a fan there.

06:25.030 --> 06:26.910
Jennifer...

06:27.210 --> 06:28.810
I have news.

06:29.480 --> 06:31.050
They've sent someone.

06:32.800 --> 06:35.460
He finally got their attention.

06:37.020 --> 06:38.120
Two years.

06:38.130 --> 06:39.620
This is just the beginning.

06:39.620 --> 06:42.520
The investigator will be
at town meeting on Saturday.

06:44.500 --> 06:46.110
Sure you're okay?

06:46.810 --> 06:47.810
Yeah.

07:06.620 --> 07:07.710
Hey Mike.

07:07.710 --> 07:10.880
Do yourself a favor and
stay away from that Jonas kid.

07:10.880 --> 07:13.310
Do us both a favor and
stay away from my mother.

07:21.690 --> 07:23.730
Looks like little Jakey's
got a girlfriend.

07:23.730 --> 07:25.270
Police escort again.

07:25.270 --> 07:26.910
Real nice.

07:27.910 --> 07:29.570
Hey, stop it!

07:30.270 --> 07:33.030
Why do you have to be
such a jerk all the time?

07:33.030 --> 07:34.230
I'm good with it.

08:40.530 --> 08:41.990
Allan.

08:42.190 --> 08:43.390
Hey, Jennifer.

08:44.090 --> 08:45.590
What a pleasant surprise.

08:46.160 --> 08:48.070
Unfortunately, it's a business call.

08:48.070 --> 08:49.770
It's Mike again.

08:49.870 --> 08:50.870
Oh.

08:51.410 --> 08:54.610
It's okay, I let him off
with a final caution.

08:54.620 --> 08:55.620
Thank you.

08:55.620 --> 08:57.090
Don't thank me yet.

08:57.100 --> 08:58.980
I do what I can to keep these
kids out of the system.

08:58.980 --> 09:01.100
But Mike, he is really pushing it.

09:01.100 --> 09:02.470
Okay, I'll talk to him.

09:05.020 --> 09:07.960
Oh, um...
get together soon?

09:08.600 --> 09:10.790
Yeah, I'd like that.

09:14.830 --> 09:17.940
Michael Emory, you and I
are gonna have a big talk.

09:19.990 --> 09:21.600
Did you hear what I said?

09:22.980 --> 09:23.930
Mike!

09:23.930 --> 09:25.640
Whatever, Jennifer.

09:25.640 --> 09:27.800
Excuse me, I'm your mother!

09:29.600 --> 09:30.940
Mike?

09:30.940 --> 09:31.870
What?

09:32.170 --> 09:33.160
What?

09:33.160 --> 09:35.670
I just had a chat with
Officer Farraday, is what.

09:35.670 --> 09:37.270
Do you have something to say to me?

09:37.990 --> 09:39.390
Not really.

09:39.400 --> 09:40.740
Mike?

09:41.400 --> 09:43.320
How is Allan?

09:43.320 --> 09:44.420
If it wasn't for Allan Farraday,

09:44.420 --> 09:45.900
you'd be sitting in the
slammer right now!

09:45.901 --> 09:47.800
All he wants to do is get in your--

09:47.800 --> 09:49.210
Don't you dare finish that sentence!

09:49.210 --> 09:50.570
Whatever. Why do you care?

09:50.580 --> 09:51.900
Why do I care?

09:51.900 --> 09:54.640
I didn't raise you to be
some delinquent is why.

09:54.655 --> 09:56.330
What would your father have said?

09:56.330 --> 09:58.220
I don't know.
Why don't you go ask him?

09:58.220 --> 10:00.630
That's right, you can't!

10:00.630 --> 10:01.960
Mike!

10:26.140 --> 10:27.250
Jake?

10:27.250 --> 10:29.320
Come here, please!

10:37.380 --> 10:38.810
You mind telling me what this is?

10:38.810 --> 10:40.640
My report card.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.590
I gave it to you last week.

10:44.390 --> 10:46.920
That's funny 'cause this one
just came in the mail.

10:47.690 --> 10:50.050
It's Charles' handiwork, I presume.

10:52.540 --> 10:54.890
You gotta hand it to him,
he certainly has talent.

10:57.220 --> 10:58.860
You know you're grounded.

10:58.860 --> 10:59.750
Right?

11:00.810 --> 11:02.020
I guess.

11:02.021 --> 11:03.520
You guess right, young man.

11:03.520 --> 11:05.660
One week.

11:06.760 --> 11:07.710
If you're having trouble...

11:07.710 --> 11:09.330
you come and talk to me.

11:09.330 --> 11:11.890
You don't have Charles
fashion forgeries.

11:14.760 --> 11:16.330
I miss him too.

11:20.450 --> 11:22.210
I'm sorry, mom.

11:23.230 --> 11:25.150
Don't let Mike see that.

11:25.730 --> 11:27.790
You know how he is
with your dad's things.

11:33.290 --> 11:34.490
Shh.

11:54.700 --> 11:55.740
- Idiot!
- Idiot!

11:58.170 --> 11:59.470
What are you guys doing here?

11:59.470 --> 12:00.470
We're going to the forest.

12:00.470 --> 12:01.630
You've gotta come with.

12:01.630 --> 12:02.980
Mom got my real report.

12:02.980 --> 12:04.340
Really? What'd she say?

12:04.340 --> 12:05.530
Could she tell them apart?

12:05.530 --> 12:07.030
Dude, she was pissed.

12:07.030 --> 12:08.260
I'm grounded.

12:08.260 --> 12:09.750
My informant confirmed the coordinates.

12:09.750 --> 12:10.970
There were sightings.

12:10.970 --> 12:12.320
Informant. Who's his informant?

12:12.320 --> 12:13.280
He means creepy Jeremy guy.

12:13.280 --> 12:14.230
Shut up, Max.

12:14.231 --> 12:16.240
Charles, I just told you I'm grounded.

12:16.240 --> 12:17.390
You totally did, but listen...

12:17.390 --> 12:19.130
I have a plan, we go there,

12:19.130 --> 12:20.810
check it out, and come straight back.

12:20.810 --> 12:22.480
We'll be an hour, tops.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.120
What if it's totally legit?

12:24.120 --> 12:25.350
We'll be rich and famous.

12:25.350 --> 12:27.290
Dude, no one makes money online.

12:27.290 --> 12:28.530
The Swedish gamer guy does.

12:28.530 --> 12:29.650
True, he made like millions.

12:29.650 --> 12:31.430
If my mom finds you guys here,

12:31.430 --> 12:32.250
I'm dead.

12:32.250 --> 12:33.910
Then hurry up and come down here,

12:33.920 --> 12:35.160
so we can go already.

12:37.670 --> 12:38.610
One hour?

12:38.610 --> 12:39.410
Totally.

12:40.910 --> 12:42.860
Okay, okay.
I'm coming.

12:46.270 --> 12:48.040
So where are we going, exactly?

12:48.290 --> 12:50.020
Here.

12:53.560 --> 12:55.120
Hey Jake. What you doing?

12:55.120 --> 12:56.080
Oh, hey.

12:56.670 --> 12:57.810
Guys, this is Abbie.

12:57.810 --> 12:59.300
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:59.300 --> 13:00.970
We're going to the forest.

13:00.970 --> 13:01.710
Cool.

13:01.710 --> 13:02.940
Mind if I tag along?

13:02.940 --> 13:04.780
- Sure, I guess.
- No, you can't.

13:05.100 --> 13:06.380
Oh. How come?

13:06.380 --> 13:09.350
It could be dangerous or something.
You might get dirty.

13:11.020 --> 13:12.310
Sounds like fun.

13:12.310 --> 13:13.660
I'll grab my bike.

13:14.230 --> 13:16.390
I don't get girls.

13:16.390 --> 13:17.460
Total aliens.

13:17.461 --> 13:18.460
From Venus.

13:18.460 --> 13:19.870
Especially pretty ones.

13:19.870 --> 13:21.540
She seems okay.

13:21.540 --> 13:23.430
Yeah? Well, she better keep up.

13:32.800 --> 13:34.580
Ready? Let's go.

13:57.030 --> 13:58.600
Guys, come on.

14:01.060 --> 14:02.700
So, what's he looking for?

14:02.700 --> 14:04.100
UFOs

14:07.400 --> 14:09.200
Charles, how much further?

14:09.200 --> 14:10.720
You said we'd be an hour.

14:10.720 --> 14:12.680
It's been like 30 minutes already.

14:13.720 --> 14:16.400
This is seriously creepy.

14:16.400 --> 14:19.100
What if we get seducted by alien?

14:19.100 --> 14:20.800
It's "abducted", moron.

14:20.800 --> 14:22.580
"Seducted"'s when you get a girlfriend.

14:22.580 --> 14:25.550
Hey, what do you call an
alien with no eyes?

14:26.150 --> 14:27.530
Alens.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.170
Get it?

14:29.170 --> 14:31.450
- A, L...
- That's a dollar.

14:31.450 --> 14:33.240
It's kind of a thing with us.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.330
You get fined a dollar for bad jokes.

14:35.330 --> 14:36.790
Yeah, Max owes like 100 bucks.

14:36.790 --> 14:38.270
Guys, this is totally it.

14:38.270 --> 14:39.790
Dylan, set up the cameras.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.770
Did you check the sensors?

14:51.770 --> 14:52.960
I don't wanna miss anything.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.130
Relax.

14:54.130 --> 14:55.230
They work.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.110
I think I dropped some candy.

15:02.170 --> 15:03.260
Ugh.

15:03.770 --> 15:05.560
Man, gross!

15:05.560 --> 15:06.850
Hey, look.

15:06.850 --> 15:09.520
Wow, it's really beautiful.

15:09.520 --> 15:11.150
Do they normally glow?

15:11.150 --> 15:12.720
Capillary action.

15:13.440 --> 15:15.000
I don't think that's a good idea.

15:16.960 --> 15:18.550
We'll study it for class.

15:19.260 --> 15:21.150
What if it's poisonous or something?

15:22.010 --> 15:23.900
Charles, don't touch anything.

15:23.900 --> 15:25.870
I only got enough charge
for one flash.

15:25.870 --> 15:26.730
One?

15:26.730 --> 15:27.630
It's all I got.

15:28.390 --> 15:29.840
Is he always like this?

15:29.840 --> 15:30.860
Charles?

15:31.690 --> 15:33.690
He just gets like that
with this UFO stuff.

15:34.230 --> 15:35.240
What's that stuff?

15:35.240 --> 15:36.440
Dunno yet.

15:36.440 --> 15:37.780
It's kinda weird, right?

15:40.600 --> 15:41.720
Max!

15:42.110 --> 15:44.120
Where are snacks?

15:45.150 --> 15:46.580
Max!

15:47.370 --> 15:48.390
I found it.

15:49.800 --> 15:51.320
- Idiot!
- Idiot!

15:52.000 --> 15:54.460
Well, that proves there's no
intelligent life out here.

16:18.730 --> 16:20.690
You're in deep trouble, young man.

16:27.970 --> 16:31.010
Jake, your friend Abbie's here.

16:31.010 --> 16:33.810
She says you have a project due.

16:33.810 --> 16:35.120
I thought I was grounded?

16:35.120 --> 16:37.590
You are. That's why you're doing
schoolwork on a weekend.

16:37.590 --> 16:39.180
Thanks so much, Mrs. Emory.

16:39.180 --> 16:40.540
The project's not due...

16:40.540 --> 16:42.240
Come on, you gotta see this.

16:47.710 --> 16:49.440
What's with all this stuff?

16:51.680 --> 16:52.900
Take a look.

16:55.490 --> 16:56.730
Do you see that?

16:56.731 --> 16:57.930
Not really.

17:04.380 --> 17:05.270
Whoa!

17:05.880 --> 17:06.869
What is it?

17:06.869 --> 17:07.960
I'm not sure.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.670
I did some preliminaries.

17:09.670 --> 17:12.250
We need to do a chemical analysis.

17:12.250 --> 17:13.910
We what?

17:17.550 --> 17:18.420
Hey Dad.

17:19.140 --> 17:20.099
Sure.

17:20.690 --> 17:21.540
Okay.

17:22.220 --> 17:23.420
I gotta go.

17:23.420 --> 17:24.920
Maybe go from here.

17:24.920 --> 17:26.220
I can't do this stuff.

17:26.220 --> 17:27.109
Sure you can.

17:27.109 --> 17:28.530
Just follow my notes.

18:24.390 --> 18:25.550
<i>Hey guys, what's up?</i>

18:25.550 --> 18:27.140
I got totally busted.

18:27.141 --> 18:28.740
<i>Guys, this is epic!</i>

18:28.740 --> 18:32.060
<i>I just mixed a frappuccino with fries...</i>

18:32.060 --> 18:33.210
<i>And it tastes like waffles!</i>

18:33.211 --> 18:34.610
<i>Shut up for a sec.</i>

18:34.610 --> 18:36.780
<i>There guys online were talking
about this glowing stuff...</i>

18:36.780 --> 18:37.970
<i>Like the stuff you found.</i>

18:37.970 --> 18:40.470
<i>Maybe they were talking diodes
or fiber optics.</i>

18:40.471 --> 18:42.510
<i>Wow, good thinking, Radio Shack.</i>

18:42.510 --> 18:44.730
<i>Wait, they said the military's been
looking for it.</i>

18:44.730 --> 18:46.630
<i>Like it's top secret or something.</i>

18:46.630 --> 18:47.790
<i>Maybe it gives you super powers.</i>

18:47.790 --> 18:48.590
<i>Are you for real?</i>

18:48.590 --> 18:49.510
Guys, I gotta go.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.610
I told you to stay out of Dad's room.

18:59.610 --> 19:01.560
It's mine too.
He gave it to both of us.

19:02.280 --> 19:03.270
What's all this?

19:03.270 --> 19:05.480
Making love potions
for your little girlfriend?

19:05.480 --> 19:06.490
She's not my girlfriend.

19:06.490 --> 19:07.510
Leave it!

19:07.510 --> 19:09.800
Come on, Jakey.
Let's get a real reaction going here.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.010
- Stop it!
- It's alive!

19:11.910 --> 19:13.940
- Stop it!
- It's alive!

19:14.500 --> 19:16.750
Why do you have to be such a d--

19:16.750 --> 19:17.900
Now, now. Language, Jake.

19:18.210 --> 19:19.580
Get out of my room!

19:19.580 --> 19:20.680
Chill, lover boy.

19:20.680 --> 19:22.800
Have fun with your little potions.

20:53.950 --> 20:55.410
No way.

21:09.820 --> 21:11.260
What are you?

21:13.820 --> 21:16.000
It's okay.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.580
Come on.

21:20.530 --> 21:22.010
It's okay, come on.

21:42.010 --> 21:44.180
"Magnes"

21:46.510 --> 21:47.420
Magnes.

21:47.920 --> 21:49.020
Magnus.

21:49.020 --> 21:50.970
Magnus, that's what I'll call you.

21:54.960 --> 21:56.270
Hey boy.

21:56.270 --> 21:58.250
Pleased to meet you.

22:05.400 --> 22:07.270
Come on, it's okay.

22:07.270 --> 22:08.410
Come on.

22:14.660 --> 22:16.150
Jake. Jake, wake up!

22:16.150 --> 22:19.920
Ah, look at this room.
Seriously?

22:19.920 --> 22:21.950
You guys treat this place
like a dump!

22:23.040 --> 22:24.860
Are you listening to me?

22:24.860 --> 22:26.640
You better have this place spotless

22:26.640 --> 22:27.980
as soon as we come home, am I clear?

22:27.980 --> 22:29.480
Okay. Sorry.

22:29.480 --> 22:30.770
Get dressed!

22:30.770 --> 22:32.620
'Cause you're coming with me
to the town meeting.

22:36.920 --> 22:38.240
Where are you?

22:45.020 --> 22:47.130
Maybe I dreamed it.

23:03.940 --> 23:05.170
Jake.

23:06.370 --> 23:07.470
Shh.

23:07.590 --> 23:09.440
Jake, gotta go.

23:09.440 --> 23:10.360
Just a minute.

23:10.560 --> 23:12.160
Now, Jake.

23:13.460 --> 23:16.360
Shh. Shh.

23:17.940 --> 23:19.600
I'm not kidding.

23:34.720 --> 23:35.910
Stay!

23:47.780 --> 23:49.440
No, stay.

23:52.750 --> 23:54.700
It's okay, I'm coming back,

23:54.700 --> 23:55.680
Jake?

23:55.680 --> 23:56.760
Coming.

24:05.540 --> 24:07.510
Jake, would you hurry up, please?

24:09.290 --> 24:11.440
Mom, I'm not feeling too well.

24:11.440 --> 24:13.090
You were fine five minutes ago.

24:13.090 --> 24:15.220
I know, I just started feeling bad.

24:15.220 --> 24:16.570
Maybe I should stay home.

24:17.290 --> 24:18.750
Also, I'm grounded, so I can't go.

24:18.750 --> 24:20.470
You go where I tell you to go.

24:20.470 --> 24:22.070
Hurry up, I'll be late!

24:22.070 --> 24:23.370
- But Mom!
- In!

24:39.960 --> 24:41.180
What on earth?

24:41.181 --> 24:42.380
No, Mom, wait!

24:42.380 --> 24:43.210
I can explain!

24:43.211 --> 24:44.810
Where do you think you're going?

24:45.630 --> 24:47.790
You're in deep trouble, young man!

24:53.170 --> 24:54.310
Good morning, everyone.

24:54.310 --> 24:55.610
Good morning.

24:55.610 --> 24:58.590
I'm an epidemiologist with the EPA.

24:59.250 --> 25:01.730
I've been tasked with the investigation

25:01.730 --> 25:04.500
of a possible disease cluster here
in Brightwood.

25:04.510 --> 25:06.810
Now please, everyone. I know

25:06.810 --> 25:08.330
that you want answers.

25:08.330 --> 25:10.160
And I'm here to find those answers.

25:24.590 --> 25:26.120
A couple of nights back, uh...

25:26.920 --> 25:29.460
Me and Will, we were fishing.

25:29.990 --> 25:33.290
And uh, we caught something.

25:34.090 --> 25:35.500
A monster.

25:57.410 --> 25:58.600
Ladies and gentlemen...

25:58.600 --> 26:02.000
My name is Colonel Douglas Roderick.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.450
I'm in command of operations
at Fort Brightwood.

26:28.560 --> 26:31.700
The military is here
to protect and serve.

26:32.440 --> 26:35.900
We are committed to working
with the EPA

26:35.900 --> 26:37.490
What about the UFO?

26:37.490 --> 26:38.590
Yeah, what about that?

26:49.200 --> 26:50.840
People of Brightwood...

26:50.840 --> 26:53.820
Imagination is a wonderful thing.

26:53.820 --> 26:55.100
Don't patronize us.

26:55.100 --> 26:59.670
Some of us would love to believe in
mythical monsters.

26:59.680 --> 27:01.480
This is ain't no monster, mister.

27:01.490 --> 27:03.430
We got one right here.

27:05.950 --> 27:07.720
Yeah, you see that?

27:07.720 --> 27:09.180
Yup. Right there.

27:16.910 --> 27:19.400
Gentlemen, that's a catfish.

27:19.400 --> 27:20.370
Catfish?

27:20.370 --> 27:22.050
That ain't no catfish.

27:22.050 --> 27:24.570
That one was flappin' around,
changin' all kinds o' colors.

27:25.380 --> 27:26.840
It was super weird.

27:27.560 --> 27:29.050
Super weird.

27:29.051 --> 27:31.050
I'm gonna need to take that
specimen away for testing.

27:31.050 --> 27:32.690
Of course, doctor.

27:34.310 --> 27:35.270
No, no wait a second.

27:35.520 --> 27:37.240
I want to sell that on eBay.

27:37.250 --> 27:38.330
eBay?

27:39.770 --> 27:42.210
Will you please call me if you
see something like this again?

27:42.790 --> 27:44.900
- Dad, hey...
- Hey, hey Abbie!

27:44.900 --> 27:46.880
Hey Mrs. Emory. Hey Jake.

27:46.880 --> 27:48.160
Dr. Tansy,

27:48.160 --> 27:49.590
Jennifer Emory from the clinic.

27:49.590 --> 27:51.870
Actually, we're neighbors.

27:51.870 --> 27:53.310
I'm so relieved you're actually here.

27:53.310 --> 27:55.420
Hi, Jennifer.
Look, can we chat later?

27:56.130 --> 27:57.170
Ah, I gotta go.

28:08.100 --> 28:10.090
I want that room of yours spotless.

28:16.650 --> 28:17.990
Magnus.

28:22.940 --> 28:25.010
Are you kidding me?

28:30.170 --> 28:31.100
Michael Emory.

28:31.100 --> 28:33.280
This house looks like a crime scene.

28:36.850 --> 28:38.200
Where are we going?

28:39.240 --> 28:40.530
They took that thing,

28:40.530 --> 28:43.000
those fishermen caught. Why?

28:43.490 --> 28:44.880
That's what I want to know.

28:45.880 --> 28:46.770
Dad.

28:47.070 --> 28:48.230
Stay in the car.

29:00.990 --> 29:02.430
Dr. Tansy.

29:02.800 --> 29:04.660
You appear to be lost.

29:04.660 --> 29:06.780
Can I help you with something?

29:06.780 --> 29:09.380
Colonel, I think we had a little
miscommunication back there.

29:09.980 --> 29:11.420
I'm gonna need that specimen.

29:11.420 --> 29:12.350
Specimen?

29:13.070 --> 29:14.430
Sorry, doctor.

29:14.430 --> 29:17.060
You'll have to be little more specific.

29:18.520 --> 29:20.300
Under the EPA Act of 1994,
I have sole authority...

29:20.300 --> 29:22.910
Doctor, I'm aware of your credentials.

29:23.790 --> 29:26.160
The military will be more than
happy to cooperate

29:26.160 --> 29:28.540
with all official requests.

29:31.040 --> 29:33.120
With all due respect, colonel,
this is an official request.

29:33.120 --> 29:35.300
Now, I'd appreciate it
if you'd hand over that specimen. 

29:36.940 --> 29:38.850
You take care now, doctor.

29:38.850 --> 29:41.450
I'd hate to see anything happen to you.

29:42.070 --> 29:43.580
Or your lovely daughter.

29:45.350 --> 29:47.270
Brightwood can be a funny place.

29:55.250 --> 29:56.920
Looks like a storm's coming, Fred.

30:08.250 --> 30:09.830
What was all that about?

30:09.830 --> 30:11.790
- Dad?
- Give me your phone.

30:11.790 --> 30:12.720
Why?

30:12.720 --> 30:13.890
Abbie, phone.

30:13.890 --> 30:15.290
Dad!

30:16.830 --> 30:17.940
Abigail, you promise me that you

30:17.940 --> 30:19.740
will leave your locations services on 

30:19.740 --> 30:21.320
and have your phone with you at all time.

30:21.320 --> 30:22.120
Dad!

30:22.120 --> 30:23.270
Abbie, promise me!

30:24.340 --> 30:25.830
Okay, okay, I promise.

30:26.770 --> 30:28.050
Dad, seriously, what's going on?

30:28.050 --> 30:29.300
I don't know.

30:30.030 --> 30:31.310
I know one thing.

30:31.310 --> 30:33.860
That sure as hell wasn't a catfish.

30:35.150 --> 30:37.710
Food rewards or vocal commands

30:37.720 --> 30:39.150
such as "good boy."

30:39.150 --> 30:41.350
Show your pet your...

30:44.470 --> 30:45.350
Oh, no.

30:46.250 --> 30:47.650
No, no, no, no.

30:56.120 --> 30:57.186
Whoa!

31:09.310 --> 31:10.220
<i>Hi Jake, what's up? <i></i></i>

31:10.220 --> 31:11.970
<i>- Where's your video?</i>
- Uh, camera's dead.

31:11.970 --> 31:13.660
<i>Look, we're going back to the forest.</i>

31:13.660 --> 31:14.800
<i>You've gotta come with us.</i>

31:15.560 --> 31:16.790
Stay!

31:16.790 --> 31:18.600
Okay, okay. Dude, chill.

31:19.410 --> 31:21.240
Charles, I gotta go.

31:25.070 --> 31:26.200
Oh, no.

31:31.940 --> 31:33.340
Um, hi.

31:33.350 --> 31:34.160
Hey.

31:34.360 --> 31:35.220
Hey.

31:35.220 --> 31:37.140
So, the science project
with the weird sludge stuff.

31:37.150 --> 31:39.900
No, I can't.

31:41.040 --> 31:42.030
Are you okay?

31:42.030 --> 31:43.000
Yeah, I'm fine.

31:44.250 --> 31:45.370
What was that?

31:45.370 --> 31:46.300
What was what?

31:46.450 --> 31:49.320
Uh, the huge crash that just
came from your house?

31:49.320 --> 31:50.660
Uh, nothing.

31:53.090 --> 31:55.160
Gotta go. Bye!

31:55.830 --> 31:56.930
Jake?

32:02.920 --> 32:04.330
Hello?

32:07.250 --> 32:08.320
Jake?

32:09.850 --> 32:11.130
What are you doing here?

32:11.130 --> 32:12.190
What's going on?

32:13.170 --> 32:15.130
You have to swear not to tell.

32:15.130 --> 32:15.880
Tell what?

32:15.880 --> 32:16.720
Just swear.

32:16.740 --> 32:18.320
- Listen, I...
- Swear!

32:18.420 --> 32:20.020
Okay, I swear.

32:25.520 --> 32:26.420
Shh.

32:29.080 --> 32:30.420
It's okay, he wont hurt you.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.090
Whoa. What is it?

32:34.090 --> 32:35.850
Here's the thing...

32:35.850 --> 32:38.050
You know the little science experiment?

32:38.050 --> 32:40.800
I was doing the chemical analysis stuff
and well...

32:40.800 --> 32:41.880
something happened.

32:41.997 --> 32:43.980
Something happened?

32:43.980 --> 32:44.940
You mean him?

32:45.670 --> 32:47.350
We gotta show my dad.

32:47.350 --> 32:48.970
- No, no, no, way!
- Jake!

32:48.970 --> 32:51.250
You can't. No one can know about it.

32:51.250 --> 32:53.370
They'll take him away
and they'll do tests on him.

32:53.370 --> 32:54.570
But you don't know what it is.

32:54.580 --> 32:56.370
It might be dangerous.

32:56.370 --> 32:57.830
Look at him.

32:59.070 --> 33:01.190
Does he look dangerous?

33:06.090 --> 33:07.460
He is kinda cute.

33:11.300 --> 33:12.840
Well, little guy...

33:12.840 --> 33:15.250
Looks like you just became
our research project.

34:30.639 --> 34:33.040
Officer Farraday 107 to dispatch.

34:33.780 --> 34:35.400
<i>Go ahead, 107.</i>

34:36.139 --> 34:38.730
On site, responding to 459a.

34:38.730 --> 34:41.800
Damaged warehouses,
couple of broken windows.

34:42.170 --> 34:44.280
Some damaged vehicles,
looks like juveniles.

34:45.139 --> 34:46.020
<i>Copy that.</i>

34:51.949 --> 34:52.900
Hello.

35:02.570 --> 35:04.090
Good evening, gentlemen.

35:04.750 --> 35:07.120
What's the nature of the
military presence here?

35:07.850 --> 35:09.830
We'll take it from here, officer.

35:11.300 --> 35:12.960
It's clearly a civilian matter.

35:14.520 --> 35:16.140
Mind telling me what's going on?

35:16.140 --> 35:17.470
Of course.

35:18.450 --> 35:19.710
Listen, Commander.

35:19.720 --> 35:21.390
- I'm just here trying to do my...
- It's "Colonel".

35:21.390 --> 35:22.360
Excuse me?

35:23.890 --> 35:25.130
It's "Colonel".

35:26.640 --> 35:29.170
We'll take it from here, officer?

35:29.170 --> 35:30.310
Farraday.

35:30.910 --> 35:31.800
Farraday.

35:33.960 --> 35:36.140
Keep up the good work, officer.

35:43.680 --> 35:45.130
107 to dispatch.

35:45.130 --> 35:47.750
Have we been advised
of any military operations?

35:49.130 --> 35:51.270
<i>Negative, no military assignments.</i>

35:51.910 --> 35:53.760
This is highly irregular.

35:53.770 --> 35:57.670
A military colonel has just
moved me out of my 459a.

35:59.640 --> 36:02.480
<i>Orders just through.
Advise: Stand down and vacate.</i>

36:02.480 --> 36:03.360
Vacate?

36:03.361 --> 36:04.770
<i>Affirmative, 107.</i>

36:06.430 --> 36:08.610
Roger that. 107 out.

36:22.820 --> 36:24.420
Get these lights off.

36:38.490 --> 36:39.850
Where's Mom?

36:39.850 --> 36:41.250
Work, probably.

36:41.610 --> 36:42.740
Who cares?

36:43.130 --> 36:44.810
It's a holiday weekend.

36:51.980 --> 36:53.200
Aw, man!

36:56.030 --> 36:58.290
Mom's gonna be pissed.

37:03.010 --> 37:04.380
Who are they from?

37:04.380 --> 37:05.980
Farraday.

37:16.570 --> 37:17.730
You're grounded, you know.

37:17.730 --> 37:19.260
Snitches get stiches.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.670
- Hey.
- Later, dork.

37:39.990 --> 37:41.090
Oh, hey.

37:45.290 --> 37:47.320
- Wow, he's grown.
- I know.

37:47.320 --> 37:49.040
But I mean, he's grown a lot.

37:49.900 --> 37:51.800
I've been thinking about
what he might be.

37:52.690 --> 37:55.050
I have this book on marine animals.

37:55.050 --> 37:56.080
My dad gave it to us

37:56.080 --> 37:58.170
so we could identify
the fish we caught.

37:58.170 --> 37:59.540
Somehow, I don't think
he's a fish.

37:59.540 --> 38:00.650
I know, but...

38:01.160 --> 38:03.260
that thing those fishermen caught
had a sail fin.

38:03.260 --> 38:04.620
Like Magnus.

38:04.620 --> 38:06.400
They said it changed color
and stuff.

38:06.760 --> 38:08.680
We gotta start somewhere,
I guess.

38:09.840 --> 38:10.970
Hey...

38:11.780 --> 38:12.760
Hey, sit!

38:24.240 --> 38:25.630
No, sit.

38:27.320 --> 38:28.960
Hey, quit it.

39:53.930 --> 39:55.160
Hi, this is Fred Tansy.

39:55.160 --> 39:57.880
Can you put me through to
Special Agent Martinez, please?

39:58.690 --> 39:59.800
Where?

40:00.370 --> 40:01.890
Okay, listen.

40:02.780 --> 40:04.750
Let him know I found something
at Brightwood.

40:17.490 --> 40:19.340
Fred, it's Jennifer Emory.

40:19.340 --> 40:21.050
Please call me urgently.

40:25.540 --> 40:26.440
Fred?

40:31.480 --> 40:33.400
No, no, not at all.

40:34.180 --> 40:35.540
Is everything okay?

40:35.540 --> 40:37.420
My son in trouble again, is he?

40:37.420 --> 40:39.600
No, no, nothing like that.

40:39.600 --> 40:41.930
I don't think I could cope
with that right now.

40:42.490 --> 40:44.370
Could you cope with dinner?

40:45.070 --> 40:46.270
Tomorrow night?

40:46.270 --> 40:49.600
- Say, seven?
- Yeah, that'd be nice.

40:55.250 --> 40:56.930
What's with the pictures?

40:58.730 --> 41:00.330
Oh, uh...

41:01.140 --> 41:03.960
I dunno. I guess they just remind
me of the old times with my dad.

41:08.390 --> 41:10.220
I just don't want things to change.

41:13.040 --> 41:15.430
What are his other
characteristics?

41:15.430 --> 41:17.680
Maybe do a search for "camouflage".

41:19.820 --> 41:20.680
Sorry.

41:26.110 --> 41:29.030
Jake, he doesn't look so good.

41:32.210 --> 41:33.210
Jake.

41:33.210 --> 41:34.810
I forgot to mention something.

41:34.810 --> 41:36.290
Mention what?

41:41.000 --> 41:42.400
That.

41:42.401 --> 41:44.050
He just grew like two feet.

41:44.050 --> 41:45.250
Jake.

41:47.250 --> 41:48.400
Come here, Magnus.

41:49.850 --> 41:50.900
Jake.

41:51.590 --> 41:54.160
How do you forget to mention
something like that?

41:54.720 --> 41:55.910
How big is he?

41:56.940 --> 41:58.360
53 inches.

41:59.250 --> 42:01.010
He's gonna be huge.

42:05.450 --> 42:06.840
We got a problem.

42:06.840 --> 42:08.220
We gotta show my dad.

42:08.225 --> 42:10.630
No! You can't. You swore!

42:10.640 --> 42:13.070
Jake, at this rate by tomorrow,

42:13.080 --> 42:14.400
he won't even fit in your house.

42:14.400 --> 42:15.200
I'll move him.

42:15.200 --> 42:17.440
I'll move him to the garage.
He'll be fine.

42:17.440 --> 42:18.550
Dude, you gotta see this.

42:18.550 --> 42:19.670
What are you doing here?

42:21.850 --> 42:23.860
Guys, it's okay. Calm down.

42:23.860 --> 42:24.760
He won't hurt you

42:24.760 --> 42:25.560
Holy crap!

42:25.560 --> 42:26.600
It's an alien!

42:26.600 --> 42:27.890
I mean... extraterrestrial!

42:27.890 --> 42:28.990
It's not an alien!

42:30.060 --> 42:31.300
Sit!

42:31.300 --> 42:33.620
Looks like the cat's out of the bag.

42:33.620 --> 42:35.080
Somehow, I don't think it's a cat.

42:35.080 --> 42:36.530
It's a figure of speech.

42:36.540 --> 42:37.980
I don't think it's
one of those either.

42:37.990 --> 42:38.970
Guys, it's okay.

42:40.140 --> 42:41.790
Meet Magnus.

42:41.790 --> 42:43.760
That thing has a name?

42:43.770 --> 42:46.030
Listen, you can't tell anyone, okay?

42:46.030 --> 42:48.640
Are you kidding me?
This is the find of the century.

42:48.640 --> 42:50.390
Charles, I'm serious.

42:50.390 --> 42:52.510
I am too.
Wait till I post this.

42:52.510 --> 42:54.280
Do you ever listen, Charles?

42:54.280 --> 42:56.110
- What the hell, Jake?
- Go home!

42:56.110 --> 42:57.750
- You're not filming it.
- Are you kidding me?

42:57.750 --> 42:59.180
This is worth a fortune.

42:59.180 --> 43:01.910
As a friend, I'm asking you
to go home.

43:01.920 --> 43:04.340
You know what, Jake?
I'm not sure we really are friends.

43:04.350 --> 43:06.090
Friends tell each other things.

43:06.090 --> 43:08.540
And friends don't keep massive
secrets from each other.

43:08.540 --> 43:09.840
I knew you'd do this.

43:09.840 --> 43:12.530
All you care about
is your stupid channel!

43:12.540 --> 43:15.100
Well, all you care about
is your stupid girlfriend!

43:15.100 --> 43:16.750
She's not my stupid girlfriend!

43:17.480 --> 43:19.080
Come on, guys, let's go.

43:22.910 --> 43:24.480
Can you believe that guy?

43:24.480 --> 43:26.240
I gotta go.

43:29.880 --> 43:31.390
Come here, Magnus.

43:46.430 --> 43:48.150
Dad, I have to tell you something.

43:51.730 --> 43:52.950
What's that?

43:55.240 --> 43:56.290
I don't know.

43:56.290 --> 43:58.440
They're gonna do an autopsy on him
to find out.

44:01.110 --> 44:03.040
You mean they're gonna cut it up?

44:03.041 --> 44:04.340
Mm-hmm.

44:04.970 --> 44:06.210
But what if it wasn't dead?

44:07.000 --> 44:08.880
I guess they might observe it.

44:08.880 --> 44:10.130
Observe it?

44:10.770 --> 44:12.120
For how long?

44:12.120 --> 44:13.220
I don't know.

44:13.220 --> 44:14.840
A few days, weeks maybe.

44:14.840 --> 44:16.220
Depends on what it was.

44:16.220 --> 44:19.510
This one...

44:19.980 --> 44:22.190
They're gonna wanna analyze every
inch of that one.

44:22.200 --> 44:23.930
That's a fascinating specimen.

44:26.090 --> 44:27.780
What'd you wanna tell me?

44:28.650 --> 44:29.940
Nothing.

44:29.940 --> 44:31.420
Never mind.

44:36.240 --> 44:37.250
What are you doing?

44:37.250 --> 44:38.810
That's Dad's camping bag.

44:38.810 --> 44:39.820
I told you to stay out of his stuff.

44:39.820 --> 44:40.520
Fine.

44:40.520 --> 44:41.590
Whatever.

44:45.360 --> 44:46.890
Don't go in there.

44:46.890 --> 44:47.760
Out of my way.

44:47.760 --> 44:48.660
Mike, please.

44:48.660 --> 44:49.620
Please?

44:50.290 --> 44:51.490
What are you up to?

44:52.790 --> 44:54.660
Hang on.

44:54.660 --> 44:56.310
You got your little girlfriend in there,
haven't you?

44:56.310 --> 44:58.020
No!

44:58.040 --> 45:00.220
Fine, I'll just show you.
Just...

45:01.510 --> 45:03.350
Please, don't freak out.

45:04.680 --> 45:06.640
Yeah, whatever.

45:17.400 --> 45:18.610
That's the big secret?

45:18.610 --> 45:20.790
A little old for the plush toys.

45:24.030 --> 45:25.890
What the hell is that thing?

45:26.290 --> 45:27.650
I don't know.

45:27.650 --> 45:29.050
What do you mean you don't know?

45:29.050 --> 45:30.550
You didn't you check the invoice?

45:30.550 --> 45:32.010
I didn't buy it, you moron.

45:37.610 --> 45:39.700
It's incredible.

45:40.590 --> 45:42.640
I'm keeping him, Mike.

45:44.250 --> 45:46.330
Remember that time when...

45:46.330 --> 45:47.640
we went fishing with Dad

45:47.640 --> 45:48.970
and caught that eel?

45:49.790 --> 45:52.110
We snuck it home and
put it in the bath.

45:53.420 --> 45:54.580
Yeah.

45:55.380 --> 45:56.980
Mom freaked.

45:57.720 --> 45:59.110
Right.

45:59.990 --> 46:01.540
That's no eel.

46:16.720 --> 46:18.250
I got somethin'.

46:19.560 --> 46:20.800
Yeah, you got somethin', all right.

46:20.800 --> 46:23.900
I got somethin' here...

46:23.900 --> 46:24.710
Steady.

46:25.410 --> 46:26.230
Steady.

46:58.820 --> 47:00.510
Colonel Roderick's office, please?

47:01.300 --> 47:03.000
<i>Colonel Roderick's office.</i>

47:03.000 --> 47:05.400
Yeah, good morning. This is
Dr. Fred Tansy from the EPA.

47:05.401 --> 47:07.690
I'd like to set up a meeting
with Colonel Roderick, please.

47:07.690 --> 47:08.940
<i>Hold, please.</i>

47:13.000 --> 47:13.950
Hello?

47:26.000 --> 47:27.480
<i>Dr. Tansy?</i>

47:27.480 --> 47:29.340
<i>It's Will from the town meeting.</i>

47:31.280 --> 47:32.930
I thought I'd drive you
to school this morning

47:34.320 --> 47:35.690
We can start the day as a family.

47:35.690 --> 47:37.210
You never drive us to school.

47:37.210 --> 47:38.600
Well, today I am.

47:38.600 --> 47:39.840
I'm what?

47:39.840 --> 47:41.260
Driving us to school.

47:43.860 --> 47:45.320
Uh, we're gonna walk.

47:45.330 --> 47:47.540
You got two minutes.
No arguments.

47:47.540 --> 47:49.870
We'll grab breakfast on the way.

47:50.780 --> 47:52.630
Mike, I can't leave him here.

47:52.630 --> 47:54.050
What do you want me to do about it?

47:54.050 --> 47:56.380
I don't know. You're always
getting out of stuff.

47:57.280 --> 48:00.020
I'm going to the car now.

48:00.470 --> 48:02.020
You will both be in it.

48:06.340 --> 48:08.210
- Mike.
- I'll think of something.

48:08.210 --> 48:11.150
Just don't just make her mad, okay?

48:11.150 --> 48:12.380
She's always mad.

48:12.380 --> 48:13.880
- Mike!
- All right.

48:13.880 --> 48:14.820
Okay.

48:21.540 --> 48:23.120
This breakfast thing...

48:23.120 --> 48:24.950
Can we just skip breakfast thing?

48:24.951 --> 48:27.320
Can we please not have
an argument today?

48:27.321 --> 48:29.820
Who's arguing? I'm just saying
this isn't the best day for it.

48:29.820 --> 48:32.390
Actually, Mike, today
is the perfect day for it.

48:32.390 --> 48:34.010
What does that mean?

48:34.010 --> 48:35.800
I just think it's time
we all moved on.

48:36.570 --> 48:37.970
This is about Farraday, isn't it?

48:37.970 --> 48:38.940
He asked you out again.

48:38.940 --> 48:39.740
Yes, he did.

48:39.740 --> 48:41.140
And I intend to go.

48:41.140 --> 48:42.820
Tonight, actually.

48:46.570 --> 48:49.370
Come on, guys, it's been two years.

48:49.370 --> 48:51.480
Two years is too soon to replace Dad.

48:51.480 --> 48:53.320
I'm not replacing Dad.

48:53.330 --> 48:55.500
No one will ever replace him.

48:56.150 --> 48:57.410
Don't I deserve some happiness?

48:57.410 --> 48:59.890
Not with some glorified hall monitor.

48:59.900 --> 49:00.840
That's enough.

49:00.840 --> 49:02.630
Allan's given you plenty of chances.

49:02.630 --> 49:03.870
It's about time you gave him a chance.

49:03.870 --> 49:05.980
You know what, Jennifer?
I don't need to give him jack.

49:05.980 --> 49:07.770
Don't call me Jennifer.
I'm your mother.

49:07.770 --> 49:08.590
You're not my mother.

49:08.590 --> 49:10.490
You're just some
douchebag's girlfriend.

49:12.950 --> 49:14.390
Get out!

49:20.610 --> 49:21.970
You too.

49:28.000 --> 49:29.540
That was mean, Mike.

49:29.540 --> 49:31.180
I told you not to make her mad.

49:31.180 --> 49:33.500
You want to go back home to that
thing of yours, don't you?

49:36.410 --> 49:37.890
Don't worry.

49:37.890 --> 49:39.080
I'll make it up to her.

49:48.230 --> 49:50.050
Over there, keep looking!

49:58.660 --> 49:59.890
Colonel?

50:08.790 --> 50:10.610
What can I do for you, doctor?

50:11.990 --> 50:13.930
Well, first of all, you can stop
jerkin' me around.

50:13.930 --> 50:15.660
Now, where's Will Spencer?

50:15.660 --> 50:17.300
Sorry, doctor.

50:17.300 --> 50:20.340
I'm in the middle of a
military training exercise.

50:20.340 --> 50:21.130
Colonel.

50:21.130 --> 50:22.330
Check again!

50:26.930 --> 50:29.630
Well, something stinks here and
it's not a catfish.

50:32.180 --> 50:33.760
Thanks for the house call, doctor.

51:03.250 --> 51:04.350
Watch him.

51:05.800 --> 51:07.670
Find out what he knows.

51:49.790 --> 51:50.720
Magnus?

51:54.320 --> 51:55.440
It's me, boy.

51:58.240 --> 51:59.630
What's up, boy?

52:11.590 --> 52:12.740
107 to dispatch.

52:13.670 --> 52:15.220
<i>Go ahead, 107.</i>

52:15.220 --> 52:16.580
Mike.

52:17.800 --> 52:20.100
Just checking that 10-70
on Hargray Street.

52:20.630 --> 52:21.980
<i>Copy that.</i>

52:22.900 --> 52:24.330
Relax.

52:25.040 --> 52:26.180
It's Farraday.

52:26.800 --> 52:27.880
Follow me.

52:33.570 --> 52:34.660
Abbie!

52:36.540 --> 52:38.040
Magnus, it's okay.

52:38.040 --> 52:39.640
I'm right here.

52:39.640 --> 52:40.900
- Jake!
- Sit!

52:40.900 --> 52:41.890
It's okay, it's me.

52:47.890 --> 52:49.820
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

52:49.820 --> 52:51.750
That thing is dangerous.
It has to go.

52:51.750 --> 52:53.210
He just needs more training.

52:53.210 --> 52:55.070
I just did not train him properly.

52:55.070 --> 52:56.890
Jake, whatever that thing is...

52:56.890 --> 52:58.360
It's turning wild.

52:58.360 --> 53:00.010
He belongs here.
He needs me.

53:00.010 --> 53:00.910
Look at her wrist.

53:00.910 --> 53:02.560
- He didn't mean it.
- Seriously?

53:02.560 --> 53:04.620
How long do you think
you can keep him hidden for?

53:06.380 --> 53:07.320
Stay here.

53:07.320 --> 53:09.070
I'm gonna go grab a bandage.

53:14.850 --> 53:16.410
You okay?

53:16.410 --> 53:17.360
Yeah.

53:20.900 --> 53:22.880
Sorry about what I said before.

53:22.880 --> 53:24.700
To Charles, I mean.

53:24.700 --> 53:25.860
Its fine.

53:25.860 --> 53:27.770
I didn't mean it.

53:28.520 --> 53:30.370
- I mean...
- Which part?

53:31.300 --> 53:32.310
The "girlfriend" part?

53:32.310 --> 53:34.580
- Or the "stupid" part?
- You're not stupid.

53:36.630 --> 53:38.510
Look, anyway, I'm sorry.

53:43.779 --> 53:45.011
Are we good?

53:58.950 --> 54:00.240
Mike!

54:01.330 --> 54:02.930
What are you doing, son?

54:04.530 --> 54:06.050
I'm not your son.

54:06.830 --> 54:08.770
You know what?
You're absolutely right.

54:09.470 --> 54:11.950
Why don't I just give your mom a call.
What do you say?

54:12.550 --> 54:13.660
Go ahead.

54:13.660 --> 54:15.610
Put her in the mood
for your big date tonight.

54:16.610 --> 54:18.290
Magnus. Shh.

54:24.960 --> 54:26.260
Look.

54:27.830 --> 54:29.380
If I do a search,

54:29.380 --> 54:32.070
and I find something I shouldn't,

54:33.230 --> 54:35.250
things are gonna get very complicated.

54:35.250 --> 54:36.900
- Listen up, Farraday...
- Almost finished.

54:36.900 --> 54:38.760
Just one more coat and it's done.

54:39.070 --> 54:40.150
Oh.

54:40.850 --> 54:42.250
Hello, officer.

54:42.250 --> 54:43.660
Mind telling me what
the two of you

54:43.660 --> 54:44.560
are doing out of school?

54:45.390 --> 54:46.980
Certainly.

54:46.980 --> 54:49.290
Mike's making a present for Jennifer.

54:49.290 --> 54:50.950
It's her 40th tomorrow.

54:50.950 --> 54:53.340
He was running behind,
so, I offered to help.

54:53.340 --> 54:54.670
With everything
she's been through,

54:54.671 --> 54:56.470
I just think it's
so thoughtful of him.

54:56.471 --> 54:57.500
Don't you?

54:58.230 --> 54:59.680
So, it's her birthday tomorrow?

55:02.310 --> 55:03.319
Huh.

55:03.320 --> 55:04.560
<i>Come in, 107.</i>

55:04.560 --> 55:06.660
<i>We have a 451 in progress.</i>

55:07.350 --> 55:09.010
Roger that. On my way.

55:11.170 --> 55:12.910
I suggest...

55:12.910 --> 55:14.460
you clean that cut.

55:14.460 --> 55:17.140
And then the both of you

55:17.140 --> 55:18.470
get back to school.

55:31.970 --> 55:33.240
OMG, guys, look!

55:33.240 --> 55:34.520
Another sighting!

55:34.520 --> 55:36.130
This is right near us.

55:36.130 --> 55:37.130
We gotta check it out.

55:37.150 --> 55:38.710
Uh, Charles...

55:38.711 --> 55:40.370
No. Guys, seriously.

55:40.370 --> 55:42.130
This is really close.

55:42.130 --> 55:43.580
You think?

55:44.980 --> 55:46.740
Oh my gosh!
Did guys just see that?

55:47.840 --> 55:48.620
Are you guys ready?

55:48.620 --> 55:50.050
How can anyone be ready for this?

55:50.050 --> 55:51.720
Are you kidding me?
I was born ready.

55:51.720 --> 55:54.260
Nah, I'm pretty sure you were born
naked, screaming and unable to read.

55:54.261 --> 55:55.190
Shut up, Max.

55:55.190 --> 55:55.950
Let's go!

56:00.400 --> 56:02.300
This is batch 27, boys.

56:02.300 --> 56:05.410
No one enters.
No one leaves.

56:05.410 --> 56:06.850
Nothing gets out.

56:06.850 --> 56:08.140
Guys, come on.

56:08.140 --> 56:09.660
I don't think this is a good idea.

56:09.660 --> 56:11.130
Yeah, what he said.

56:11.130 --> 56:12.230
Relax, its abandoned.

56:22.930 --> 56:23.830
Guys...

56:23.831 --> 56:25.790
- Shh.
- You shh.

56:26.930 --> 56:28.060
Ugh. Pooper.

56:28.070 --> 56:29.030
Max.

56:29.940 --> 56:30.930
Guys, look!

56:31.590 --> 56:33.290
Oh my gosh, I told you.

56:33.290 --> 56:34.670
They're totally real.

57:04.100 --> 57:06.390
- This is Charles Altman.
- Hey!

57:14.450 --> 57:16.130
I told you this wasn't a good idea.

57:16.130 --> 57:17.330
Shut up and run.

57:17.330 --> 57:18.630
We're all gonna die.

57:24.170 --> 57:25.380
I love candy.

57:25.381 --> 57:26.980
Max, come on, hurry up!

57:32.290 --> 57:33.470
What are you doing?
Get out.

57:33.470 --> 57:34.870
I told you to leave
that stuff alone.

57:34.870 --> 57:36.280
I'm not leaving him, Mike.

57:36.280 --> 57:37.390
He needs me.

57:38.090 --> 57:39.900
- I'm taking him away.
- Away?

57:39.910 --> 57:41.490
Away where? Where do you
think you can hide him?

57:41.500 --> 57:42.710
I'm taking him to the tunnel.

57:42.710 --> 57:44.660
The tunnel. What?

57:44.660 --> 57:46.570
So, you're gonna go
live out in the wild with it?

57:46.570 --> 57:47.910
Yeah, good plan, Jake.

57:47.910 --> 57:49.210
I see you've really
thought this through.

57:49.210 --> 57:51.070
I'm staying with him
and you can't stop me.

57:51.070 --> 57:53.860
That thing is dangerous.
You saw what he did to Abbie.

57:53.860 --> 57:55.900
Who's gonna be there when he goes
Jekyll and Hyde on you?

57:55.900 --> 57:57.420
He won't do that to me.

57:58.190 --> 57:59.550
He'd never do that.

57:59.550 --> 58:01.000
You can't control it.

58:01.730 --> 58:02.750
Wake up!

58:05.750 --> 58:07.350
He needs me.

58:08.170 --> 58:10.850
I made him.
He's my responsibility.

58:13.620 --> 58:15.370
I'm never going to leave him.

58:42.060 --> 58:43.670
Report.

58:43.670 --> 58:44.880
We've secured the area.

58:44.880 --> 58:46.680
Stephens and Robbs reported kids.

58:46.680 --> 58:47.900
We found this.

58:49.940 --> 58:51.650
<i>This is the find of the century</i>

58:51.650 --> 58:53.460
<i>Charles, I'm serious.</i>

58:53.460 --> 58:55.410
<i>I am too.
Wait till I post this.</i>

59:02.270 --> 59:03.260
Are you okay?

59:05.540 --> 59:07.820
Dude, we've got to
get him to the mother ship.

59:07.850 --> 59:09.290
What are you doing here?

59:09.290 --> 59:10.480
They were everywhere.

59:10.480 --> 59:11.750
- What?
- Aliens.

59:11.750 --> 59:12.890
What are you talking about?

59:12.891 --> 59:14.590
The military were
trying to capture them.

59:14.590 --> 59:16.100
But the UFOs just kept
beaming them up.

59:16.100 --> 59:17.920
I'm not convinced of your
teleportation theory.

59:17.920 --> 59:18.890
It's totally legit.

59:18.890 --> 59:20.200
I think I killed one with candy.

59:20.200 --> 59:21.290
Jake!

59:24.410 --> 59:25.650
Ah, crap!

59:27.500 --> 59:28.730
We come in peace.

59:29.360 --> 59:30.760
You gonna move it,
you gotta go now.

59:30.770 --> 59:32.040
I'm coming with you.

59:32.040 --> 59:33.040
Magnus, stay.

59:33.040 --> 59:34.840
I think we'll go 

59:34.840 --> 59:37.130
just in case the UFOs return...

59:38.030 --> 59:39.810
I'm gonna go with them.

59:42.810 --> 59:44.280
Magnus...

59:59.690 --> 01:00:01.170
Step aside.

01:00:01.170 --> 01:00:02.220
Excuse me?

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.980
I said, step aside.

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:06.310
And I said, excuse me.

01:00:06.310 --> 01:00:07.970
I don't know
who you think you are, but...

01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:08.980
I know my rights.

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:13.120
Your rights?

01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:15.200
Let me tell you about your rights.

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.850
You have the right to remain
very, very silent.

01:00:18.850 --> 01:00:20.630
Anything you say,

01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:23.550
can and will makes piss me off.

01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:26.470
Knowing and understanding these rights,

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:29.670
will protect you from any
unnecessary pain

01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:31.350
and suffering.

01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:34.990
All clear.

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:45.570
Where is it?

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:17.470
What is that?

01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:29.200
Charles was right.

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:32.270
What's wrong, boy?

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:34.600
Magnus, stop.

01:01:38.790 --> 01:01:40.660
Charles, you were right! 

01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:41.500
<i>Jake.</i> 

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:42.580
You were right about the UFOs.

01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:43.780
There's one right in front of us.
See?

01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:44.830
<i>In front of you?</i>

01:01:44.830 --> 01:01:46.030
There's one right here!

01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:48.520
<i>Jake, you've got to
get out there now.</i>

01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:49.140
What?

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:50.430
<i>They're drones.</i>

01:01:50.430 --> 01:01:51.960
<i>They're military drones.</i>

01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:56.870
Jake, run!

01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:22.600
Jake, come on.

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:41.210
Darn it, Magnus.

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:43.150
Where are you?

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:05.910
Jake.

01:03:56.590 --> 01:03:58.190
Good boy, Magnus.

01:04:19.290 --> 01:04:20.450
Abbie?

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.980
Wow, it looks like stars inside.

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:04.070
Glow worms.
They're like him.

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:06.270
Magnus, look.

01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:29.810
It's okay. You'll be safe here, boy.

01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:31.410
You'll be safe here, okay?

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:35.180
You'll be safe here, boy.

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:37.840
I'm right here. It's okay.

01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:40.340
Shh. I'm right here.

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:44.820
Stay. You'll be safe.

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:54.320
It's okay. I'm right here.

01:05:58.200 --> 01:05:59.730
Here you go.

01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:03.130
You'll be safe, okay?

01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:08.610
You gotta stay now.

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:23.900
Come on.

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:25.900
Let's go home.

01:06:36.090 --> 01:06:37.590
There were four beds
in that room

01:06:37.590 --> 01:06:39.490
and they've all been
slept in as well.

01:06:39.630 --> 01:06:41.030
I mean does anybody clean here?

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:46.130
I was kinda surprised
you asked me out again.

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:48.380
Really?

01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:51.510
I mean, I hoped you would.

01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:54.450
I thought I might've scared you off.

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.321
I mean, Mike...

01:06:56.322 --> 01:06:57.420
No.

01:06:57.830 --> 01:06:59.970
No, kids in this town
have got it tough.

01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:03.090
You know, there's only two options.

01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:06.110
Military or mischief.

01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:10.470
I've been that kid.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.100
Would we like dessert?

01:07:12.101 --> 01:07:14.800
Uh, I'll just have coffee, thanks.

01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:15.850
Okay.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.280
I organized a little surprise

01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:22.480
for you.

01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:25.200
Um, I wanted to get in early, so...

01:07:25.803 --> 01:07:29.500
Uh, happy 40th birthday!

01:07:33.703 --> 01:07:35.500
Oh, uh...

01:07:36.403 --> 01:07:38.200
Ah, Allan...

01:07:38.370 --> 01:07:39.530
I'm really flattered.

01:07:39.733 --> 01:07:42.330
But it's not my birthday.

01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:13.850
They're gonna kill him.

01:08:17.350 --> 01:08:19.729
There, at the old substation.

01:08:34.029 --> 01:08:35.149
Hold position!

01:08:35.151 --> 01:08:36.450
Leave him alone!

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:45.790
Magnus, it's me!

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:51.590
OMG, I gotta film this!

01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:52.630
Isn't that Jake?

01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:55.660
I'm right here!

01:08:57.439 --> 01:08:59.370
- Right here.
- Jake!

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:01.740
Mom, it's okay.

01:09:07.479 --> 01:09:08.819
Sit.

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:23.090
Drop.

01:09:26.189 --> 01:09:27.229
Sorry.

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:42.729
Get the kid outta there!

01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:44.010
End it!

01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:45.250
No!

01:09:45.290 --> 01:09:46.460
Leave him alone!

01:09:46.859 --> 01:09:49.060
Leave him alone!

01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:50.359
Sorry!

01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:51.790
Wrap it up.

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:24.820
I'll take Abbie home.

01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:51.180
Charles, this is not the time.

01:10:57.860 --> 01:10:59.470
Charles, will you quit...

01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:10.150
Easy, people!

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:11.950
He's coming around.

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:16.670
Let's get him secured.

01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:18.690
Put him on ice.

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:29.560
Dad? Dad!

01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:38.110
Farraday 107 to dispatch.

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:40.220
We have a 207 here.

01:11:40.233 --> 01:11:41.090
<i>Proceed.</i>

01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:42.060
I need back up.

01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:43.860
<i>Negative, 141. We are in lockdown.</i>

01:11:44.010 --> 01:11:45.000
What?

01:11:45.001 --> 01:11:46.050
<i>Initiating curfew.</i>

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:47.180
On whose authority?

01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:49.350
<i>Order comes from military HQ.</i>

01:11:53.210 --> 01:11:54.220
Roderick.

01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:57.440
Do you have it?

01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:00.770
Building 6. Negative 202.130.2

01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:02.160
What is going on?

01:12:02.161 --> 01:12:04.860
Well, Mike, looks like you've
finally made something of yourself.

01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:06.330
Guys, I'm speaking to you.

01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:07.530
This is delicious, Mrs. Emory.

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:08.840
Where did you get this picture?

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:09.940
Yearbook photo.

01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:12.800
You sure this will get us on base?

01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:15.900
Get you on base? You guys aren't
going anywhere near that base.

01:12:15.901 --> 01:12:16.800
Mom, we got this.

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:18.270
You most certainly have not got this.

01:12:18.271 --> 01:12:20.470
Don't worry, Mrs. Emory,
I brought insurance.

01:12:20.471 --> 01:12:23.340
These babies will be streaming
live the whole time.

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:24.470
Check it out!

01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:25.890
All comms are out, so I set up

01:12:25.891 --> 01:12:28.739
a close-circuit Wi-Fi relay to
bypass the phone carriers.

01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:29.860
You guys, this is ridiculous!

01:12:29.861 --> 01:12:31.539
I know, they don't even have snacks.

01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:33.420
Mom, listen, call as many
people as you can

01:12:33.421 --> 01:12:35.720
and tell them to tune in
to Charles' channel.

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:37.110
Jake, there's no way I'm
gonna let you do this...

01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:38.210
Mom, just listen.

01:12:39.070 --> 01:12:40.480
- Are you okay?
- They've taken Fred.

01:12:40.650 --> 01:12:42.350
- What?
- This has gone too far.

01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:44.250
I'm going to Fort Brightwood
to bring him back.

01:12:44.251 --> 01:12:45.350
We all are.

01:12:45.670 --> 01:12:46.830
No, you kids are not going anywhere.

01:12:47.070 --> 01:12:49.380
For years, all you've talked
about is how the military

01:12:49.381 --> 01:12:50.384
have done something to us.

01:12:50.385 --> 01:12:52.200
How they did something to Dad.

01:12:52.204 --> 01:12:53.790
Jake, there's no way
I'm gonna let you do this.

01:12:53.790 --> 01:12:54.590
Mom, just let him talk.

01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:56.430
They took my friend.

01:12:56.431 --> 01:12:59.030
Now they've taken Abbie's dad.
They've taken enough.

01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:00.989
It's time for us to do something.

01:13:00.990 --> 01:13:01.940
Hey guys...

01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:05.100
I understand that you want to help.
I get it.

01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:06.630
- But I can't allow you...
- Allow?

01:13:06.990 --> 01:13:10.200
Once you set foot on Fort Brightwood,
you have zero authority.

01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:12.640
We're going with you.
Allow us to or not.

01:13:15.710 --> 01:13:17.320
Allan, I don't want you to go.

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:18.680
Can't someone else handle this?

01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:19.760
There is no one else.

01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:22.500
Roderick's got the entire force
locked out.

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:27.180
I gotta go. Time is critical.

01:13:27.970 --> 01:13:29.780
Keep these kids out of trouble.

01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:43.240
Is there any point in me telling you

01:13:43.241 --> 01:13:46.040
that what you're planning here
is both illegal and dangerous?

01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:48.490
Not a chance.

01:13:48.650 --> 01:13:50.260
Danger's my middle name.

01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:52.960
No, it's not. It's Francis.

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:53.970
Get in.

01:13:59.730 --> 01:14:00.630
Whoa.

01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:04.330
I know. Imported.

01:14:04.930 --> 01:14:06.720
Where'd you get it?

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:08.320
I borrowed it.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.120
Borrowed?

01:14:11.690 --> 01:14:15.850
Law and justice don't always
tread the same path, Mike.

01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:19.330
We'll have it back
in the impound by morning.

01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:20.920
The police impound?

01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:23.100
That place is like a fort!

01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:26.050
So I've heard.

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:30.130
Yeah, well, growing up
in a tough town

01:14:30.130 --> 01:14:32.130
you tend to acquire certain

01:14:32.431 --> 01:14:33.850
skills.

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:36.150
So I've heard.

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:42.800
I can't see!

01:14:42.801 --> 01:14:43.788
The camera's not on yet.

01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:46.150
I know, genius.
My helmet's too big.

01:14:46.270 --> 01:14:48.960
Use this.
You'd better not lose it.

01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:50.690
What if this doesn't work?

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:52.910
Do not worry, it'll work.

01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:56.330
So, Charles, where'd you get
the ID template?

01:14:56.331 --> 01:14:58.899
- My informant.
- Who says "informant"?

01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:00.160
That's what I said.

01:15:00.161 --> 01:15:01.160
It's probably some guy's library.

01:15:01.170 --> 01:15:04.370
Do not be stupid.
Nobody uses the library anymore.

01:15:04.610 --> 01:15:06.300
I got it from truth.wiki.

01:15:06.810 --> 01:15:07.940
Oh.

01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:10.400
We are so screwed.

01:15:13.230 --> 01:15:14.780
Everybody quiet.
We're here.

01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:32.560
What's the cargo?

01:15:32.581 --> 01:15:34.560
Biological materials.

01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:36.220
You wanna open her up?

01:15:36.630 --> 01:15:38.010
See that symbol there, buddy?

01:15:38.011 --> 01:15:40.110
Go ahead. But it's your funeral.

01:15:46.450 --> 01:15:49.700
Biohazard symbol.
Good thinking.

01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:51.950
I don't think he's buying the ID.

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:54.950
Stay calm.

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:09.610
So, your mom's birthday.

01:16:10.210 --> 01:16:11.860
March.

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:15.670
40?

01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:17.480
38.

01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:30.250
We're in.

01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:39.940
We got a network.

01:16:41.150 --> 01:16:43.380
Abbie, you got a position on your dad?

01:16:43.490 --> 01:16:44.300
Here.

01:16:45.930 --> 01:16:46.810
He's in there.

01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:49.580
Who brought snacks?

01:16:49.681 --> 01:16:51.390
Are you kidding me?

01:16:52.481 --> 01:16:53.640
Dylan, are we on?

01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:55.570
Initializing live stream. 

01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:59.530
Okay we're on. That's Charles.
That's the van.

01:16:59.550 --> 01:17:01.310
- And that's Max.
- That's it!

01:17:01.310 --> 01:17:02.860
That's where they're keeping him.

01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:05.250
Hey, you can see how hungry I am.

01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:07.400
What the?

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:09.250
Idiot, you broke it already.

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.110
The antenna's moved.

01:17:20.010 --> 01:17:23.490
Okay, Charles will create a diversion
while we find Magnus.

01:17:23.550 --> 01:17:24.760
Mike and Max are with me.

01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:26.460
Abbie, you go with Farraday
and find your dad.

01:17:26.461 --> 01:17:27.260
This is Charles Altman,

01:17:27.261 --> 01:17:29.009
coming to you live from
Fort Brightwood military base...

01:17:29.010 --> 01:17:30.329
Charles!

01:17:30.330 --> 01:17:31.230
Sorry.

01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:38.940
Okay, it's 11:02.
We leave 11:20.

01:17:39.210 --> 01:17:40.120
Let's move.

01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:43.580
Will you be okay?

01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:45.040
Yeah. You?

01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:47.610
- Good luck.
- You too.

01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:51.570
Hey, lover boy.

01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.980
Let's go.

01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:55.830
We good?

01:17:56.331 --> 01:17:58.230
All the net feeds are stable.

01:17:58.940 --> 01:17:59.980
Hey, wait.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.810
What if I'm discovered?

01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:05.020
Oh, don't worry, nobody's
discovered online anymore.

01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:07.220
That's a dollar!

01:18:14.150 --> 01:18:16.450
- Shh.
- I can't help it, I'm hungry.

01:18:19.650 --> 01:18:20.960
Hey, any of you guys seen

01:18:20.961 --> 01:18:23.540
the large dino-monster
that trashed the town earlier?

01:18:23.541 --> 01:18:24.430
Hey!

01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:29.690
Not bad.

01:18:30.530 --> 01:18:32.090
Come on.

01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:37.480
In here.

01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:48.940
Jake, be careful.

01:18:56.380 --> 01:18:57.910
Looks like he shrunk.

01:18:57.930 --> 01:18:59.780
He's changing again.

01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:05.060
Hey boy, it's me.

01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:14.810
Charles, come in.

01:19:15.170 --> 01:19:16.909
This is Charles Altman,
coming to you

01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:19.070
live from Fort Brightwood
military base.

01:19:19.690 --> 01:19:21.489
Check out my live feeds exposing
the greatest...

01:19:21.490 --> 01:19:22.290
Whoa!

01:19:44.330 --> 01:19:45.760
It's okay.

01:19:46.490 --> 01:19:47.920
I'm right here.

01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:49.820
I'm right here.

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:51.020
Shh.

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:54.170
Jake, time to get moving.

01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:00.240
Come on, boy, we gotta move.

01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:04.430
Up.

01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:14.979
Come on, Magnus.
We gotta go. Up!

01:20:14.980 --> 01:20:16.120
He's not gonna get up.

01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:18.570
Get up!

01:20:20.570 --> 01:20:22.780
Magnus, get up!

01:20:27.490 --> 01:20:30.050
Jake, leave it.
We have to go.

01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:31.220
Get up!

01:20:31.650 --> 01:20:34.730
Gross. Looks like ectoplasma.

01:20:34.930 --> 01:20:36.640
It's "ectoplasm".

01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:39.310
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:41.390
Ecto...

01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:43.390
Ecto...

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:45.590
Ecto...

01:20:45.890 --> 01:20:47.190
Ectothermic!

01:20:47.190 --> 01:20:49.770
Ha! He's cold-blooded.
We just need to warm him up.

01:20:50.450 --> 01:20:51.920
Lights, we need lights.

01:20:53.190 --> 01:20:55.550
Dad?

01:20:58.710 --> 01:21:00.520
He should be here.

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:16.430
Do not worry. We'll find him.

01:21:16.810 --> 01:21:17.960
He could be anywhere.

01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:26.200
Crap. Quick, Charles, go to...

01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:28.130
No, no, no! What the?

01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:32.600
Stupid antenna!

01:21:35.710 --> 01:21:37.190
Come on, we gotta go now.

01:21:37.190 --> 01:21:38.390
No, wait, he'll warm up.

01:21:39.250 --> 01:21:40.650
Come on, boy, get up!

01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:45.310
Jake, we're out of time.

01:21:46.650 --> 01:21:47.840
Hey, I found a map.

01:21:47.850 --> 01:21:49.120
It's a map of the building.

01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:51.020
Is there a cell block on there?

01:21:51.610 --> 01:21:56.700
Kitchen, com center,
a bunch of interview rooms.

01:21:58.730 --> 01:21:59.960
Bingo!

01:22:09.650 --> 01:22:10.860
What is it?

01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:14.230
Evidence.

01:22:16.530 --> 01:22:18.900
Goggles, come in, goggles.
I'm totally offline.

01:22:18.901 --> 01:22:20.510
Quit calling me that.

01:22:20.930 --> 01:22:22.700
I'm coming.

01:22:22.701 --> 01:22:24.040
The antenna moved again.

01:22:24.041 --> 01:22:25.440
Didn't you check this stuff?

01:22:25.490 --> 01:22:26.570
I just built a closed network

01:22:26.571 --> 01:22:28.770
out of a roll of tape
and a can of chips.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:29.620
Give me a break.

01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:31.310
Come on, we have to go now.

01:22:31.311 --> 01:22:32.409
We're not leaving without him.

01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:35.030
There's no time left, come on!

01:22:35.470 --> 01:22:38.220
Max! Max!

01:22:38.225 --> 01:22:39.420
I'm here!

01:22:40.090 --> 01:22:41.170
You've gotta be kidding me.

01:22:41.171 --> 01:22:42.270
What? I'm hungry.

01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:45.260
Want one? There's beans, chili,

01:22:45.276 --> 01:22:46.960
or beef brisket.

01:22:47.130 --> 01:22:48.640
Max, you're a genius!

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:51.610
MREs, meals ready to eat.

01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:52.760
Grab as many as you can.

01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:55.200
Why don't we just order a pizza
while we're at it?

01:22:55.205 --> 01:22:56.200
Are you nuts?

01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:58.760
They self-heat! We'll use them
to heat him up.

01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:04.230
Chili, chili, chili...

01:23:04.231 --> 01:23:07.030
Max, quit.
We don't need the rations.

01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:08.690
But what about snacks for later?

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:14.120
Dad? Dad, it's me, Abbie.

01:23:14.350 --> 01:23:16.220
Abbie, what are you doing here?

01:23:16.221 --> 01:23:17.720
Dr. Tansy, can you walk?

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:19.090
Yeah, I think so.

01:23:19.091 --> 01:23:20.290
Come on.

01:23:37.891 --> 01:23:39.000
Crap.

01:23:48.630 --> 01:23:50.590
You boys are in some
serious trouble. 

01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:53.430
Breaking and entering.

01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:56.180
Tampering with military assets.

01:23:56.181 --> 01:23:57.980
He's not an asset!

01:23:58.790 --> 01:23:59.770
Him?

01:23:59.771 --> 01:24:01.170
He's mine.

01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:02.390
I made him.

01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:05.060
Oh. Yours?

01:24:05.130 --> 01:24:07.470
I'm not gonna let you kill him.

01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:09.660
Oh, I'm not gonna kill him.

01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:12.210
Not yet.

01:24:17.850 --> 01:24:19.320
Where are the boys?

01:24:19.321 --> 01:24:20.720
- Uh...
- Where are they?

01:24:21.670 --> 01:24:23.450
Charles, come in!

01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:25.940
<i>OMG, we just hit 223,000 views.</i>

01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:27.340
Shut up about your channel.

01:24:27.341 --> 01:24:28.400
We need eyes on Building 6.

01:24:29.790 --> 01:24:34.420
How about you start by telling me
exactly how you made... him?

01:24:34.630 --> 01:24:35.870
Don't tell him anything, Jake.

01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:38.130
Leave him alone!

01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:40.110
Then tell me how you made it.

01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:41.200
I can't remember.

01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:43.300
You can't remember.

01:24:43.530 --> 01:24:45.240
- Open it up!
- No!

01:24:45.450 --> 01:24:47.330
Then tell me how you made it!

01:24:47.970 --> 01:24:52.520
Somewhere in that little head
of yours is the answer.

01:24:52.610 --> 01:24:55.100
And one way or another,
I will get it out of you.

01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:56.350
Lock 'em up!

01:24:56.350 --> 01:24:57.650
No, no, wait, I...

01:24:58.330 --> 01:25:00.090
I remember.

01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:06.210
Magnesium.

01:25:08.010 --> 01:25:09.510
Hydrogen.

01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:11.210
Sodium.

01:25:11.710 --> 01:25:13.510
Sodium bicarbonate.

01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:15.830
There must be something else!

01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:21.430
Uh, protein shake.
I spilled a protein shake.

01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:23.320
A protein shake.

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:25.280
Two years of R&D

01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:28.780
and the stabilizing
element is a protein shake.

01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:30.980
A simple enzyme.

01:25:36.570 --> 01:25:38.730
We have what we need.

01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:40.230
Destroy it.

01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:41.630
No!

01:25:54.580 --> 01:25:56.250
OMG, did you just see that?

01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:58.710
We just hit 900,000 views.

01:26:00.630 --> 01:26:02.210
Come on, boy!

01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:13.800
They don't leave the base.

01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:23.360
Stay with him!

01:26:31.990 --> 01:26:33.420
Whoa, whoa, here.

01:26:39.850 --> 01:26:41.430
Take it out!

01:26:42.850 --> 01:26:45.480
Come on, Magnus, come over here,
this way!

01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:51.890
Shoot it!

01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:14.460
Hey Mikey!

01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:17.330
Dude, what are you doing here?

01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:18.720
Come on.

01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:21.080
Let's get you back on civilian soil.

01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:24.610
Magnus, come on,
come here!

01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:26.570
Boy, come over here!

01:27:28.810 --> 01:27:30.600
Magnus, come here!

01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:33.790
Come!

01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:35.750
Come on, boy!

01:27:48.230 --> 01:27:49.740
No, stay!

01:28:00.170 --> 01:28:01.770
Come on, boy!

01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:07.770
Jake, hurry.

01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:12.420
Come, boy!

01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:14.570
Come on, right here!

01:28:20.350 --> 01:28:21.260
Come on, Jake.

01:28:21.261 --> 01:28:22.260
We need to go.

01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:24.660
Come on, Magnus I'm here, come!

01:28:29.810 --> 01:28:32.370
Come, Magnus!

01:28:40.150 --> 01:28:41.150
Go!

01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:43.250
Just go!

01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:01.890
Colonel Roderick.

01:29:02.490 --> 01:29:05.490
You're under arrest for
kidnapping and conspiracy.

01:29:05.620 --> 01:29:06.470
You have the right to...

01:29:06.471 --> 01:29:08.670
Officer, you're out
of your jurisdiction.

01:29:09.230 --> 01:29:10.510
And way out of your depth.

01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:13.530
It's a case of your word
against the government.

01:29:13.690 --> 01:29:14.890
That's where you're wrong.

01:29:14.890 --> 01:29:16.870
It's your word against the government.

01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:19.200
You wanna prosecute me?

01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:20.700
Take a shot.

01:29:23.230 --> 01:29:26.130
What I do here saves lives.

01:29:26.131 --> 01:29:28.730
Your lives.
While you sleep at night.

01:29:28.930 --> 01:29:30.540
Safe and warm in your little beds.

01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:32.700
I protect you from monsters.

01:29:33.250 --> 01:29:34.370
Real monsters.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.260
Monsters that would devour the
very freedoms you take for granted.

01:29:38.270 --> 01:29:39.330
You're the monster, Roderick.

01:29:39.331 --> 01:29:41.130
You've endangered the lives
of everyone in this town.

01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:43.950
Endangered? Maybe.

01:29:43.950 --> 01:29:46.240
Freedom always has its price.

01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:49.950
The price you morons at the EPA
will never understand.

01:29:50.230 --> 01:29:52.370
War is a numbers game.

01:29:52.970 --> 01:29:55.170
Peace is a numbers game.

01:29:55.230 --> 01:29:58.110
A hundred lost, a million saved.

01:29:58.111 --> 01:29:59.930
126, you maniac!

01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:03.310
126 fatalities in the past two years

01:30:03.311 --> 01:30:05.910
due to clear military misconduct.

01:30:06.090 --> 01:30:08.160
I may have killed 126.

01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:13.460
Hell, I'll kill hundreds more
to get my work into the field.

01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:16.570
As I said, it's your word
against the government.

01:30:16.750 --> 01:30:18.890
And here, I am the government.

01:30:22.090 --> 01:30:23.360
Wrong again, idiot.

01:30:23.363 --> 01:30:27.460
It's your word against
5.4 million viewers on my live feed.

01:30:27.570 --> 01:30:29.350
You are so screwed, buddy.

01:30:29.580 --> 01:30:33.080
<i>This was the scene last week at a
remote military installation.</i>

01:30:33.180 --> 01:30:35.130
<i>Where one Colonel Douglas Roderick
was arrested</i>

01:30:35.130 --> 01:30:39.630
<i>on charges of conspiracy to commit
acts of biological terror.</i>

01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:42.240
<i>Authorities are crediting
a bunch of local children</i>

01:30:42.241 --> 01:30:44.240
<i>with the discovery of
crucial evidence</i>

01:30:44.420 --> 01:30:47.070
<i>in what appears to be
an on-going investigation.</i>

01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:51.000
<i>And in other news, residents
in the nearby town of Brightwood</i>

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.100
<i>claim to have seen monsters.</i>

01:30:53.130 --> 01:30:56.390
<i>No, ma'am it wasn't no catfish.</i>

01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:58.420
<i>I can tell you that right now.</i>

01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:00.420
<i>Super weird.</i>

01:31:01.900 --> 01:31:03.420
<i>Super weird.</i>

01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:06.550
- What?
- What? No.

01:31:06.550 --> 01:31:09.050
Oh, it's time to level.

01:31:09.090 --> 01:31:11.610
We've been through a lot,
the hazmat suits.

01:31:11.632 --> 01:31:13.110
We won't talk about that.

01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:23.790
<i>OMG, check it out!
5,200 dollars!</i>

01:31:23.970 --> 01:31:25.140
This is awesome!

01:31:25.141 --> 01:31:26.240
<i>We're rich!</i>

01:31:26.450 --> 01:31:28.590
Jake, Abbie's here too.

01:31:28.590 --> 01:31:30.140
Coming.

01:31:30.590 --> 01:31:32.660
Hey, Charles, I gotta go.

01:31:32.930 --> 01:31:33.640
See you later?

01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:34.840
<i>Totally.</i>

01:31:34.970 --> 01:31:37.060
<i>We're going to the forest.
Bring Abbie.</i>

01:31:37.061 --> 01:31:38.360
Cool.

01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:04.270
Magnus?

01:32:04.290 --> 01:32:06.850
Is it you?

01:32:08.300 --> 01:32:09.240
Sit.

01:32:10.190 --> 01:32:11.680
