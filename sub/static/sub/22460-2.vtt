Jez, mate, can you stop jamming?

00:52.680 --> 00:56.679
You can't stop someone from jamming,
that's against jam law.

00:57.040 --> 01:00.519
Dude, that's not jam,
that's just total fucking marmalade.

01:00.520 --> 01:03.119
OK, I'm gonna stop jamming now,

01:03.120 --> 01:07.119

that you had to tell me in person?

01:43.440 --> 01:45.199
Well, the news is, Mark...

01:45.200 --> 01:46.999
Don't do the X
Factor on me, Gerard.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.239
Dobby's got a boyfriend.

01:48.240 --> 01:50.079
Dobby's got a boyfriend. Oh, God! Really?

01:50.080 --> 01:52.279
His name's Simon. He's younger, slimmer,

01:52.280 --> 01:54.279
better-looking and more fashionable than us.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.759

our relationship, Gerard.'

01:59.440 --> 02:00.359
So, what's he like?

02:00.360 --> 02:01.519
So, what's he like? Graphic designer.

02:01.520 --> 02:04.439
Oh, please! "Hello,
can I redesign your logo?"

02:04.440 --> 02:07.519
"Yes, that'll be 100,000 for a squiggle."

02:07.520 --> 02:08.639

02:14.560 --> 02:15.879
Maybe it's a wake-up call.

02:15.880 --> 02:17.879
Maybe for guys like us,
Dobby was always a pipe dream.

02:17.880 --> 02:20.919
Maybe for guys like us, Dobby was always
a pipe dream. 'Don't pull me into
your filthy bath water, I'm a player!'

02:20.920 --> 02:23.959
It may surprise you to know,
but the truth is, until I was 26,

02:23.960 --> 02:25.919
I'd never been with a woman.

02:25.920 --> 02:28.599
Yes, you do surprise me.

02:28.600 --> 02:29.799
'You've been with a woman?'

02:29.800 --> 02:33.359
I guess over the years I've had a
bit of a tough time with the ladies.

02:33.360 --> 02:34.239
Really?

02:34.240 --> 02:36.159
Really? I've done some mad shit, though.

02:36.160 --> 02:40.159
I remember this one time at Uni,
I was trying it on with this chick

02:41.640 --> 02:45.439
and getting nowhere, so I pulled
the old palm-reading routine.

02:45.440 --> 02:49.439
Physical contact. Ended up
going back to her place. Sweet.

02:49.720 --> 02:50.479
God, really?

02:50.480 --> 02:51.599
God, really? Oh, yeah.

02:51.600 --> 02:55.479
'Then talked to her about my mother's
suspected infidelities until I cried.'

02:55.480 --> 02:56.919
I've got a million
stories like that.

02:56.920 --> 03:00.359
I've got a million stories like that.
Huh. Oh, wow! They've got Stalin.

03:00.360 --> 03:01.439
What?

03:01.440 --> 03:04.639
They haven't had Uncle Joe in
for a while.It's nice detail.

03:04.640 --> 03:06.119
Yeah, the detail's not bad.

03:06.120 --> 03:06.599
'Danger, Mark.'

03:06.600 --> 03:08.919
'Danger, Mark.' It's all right,
Mark, they're not toys.

03:08.920 --> 03:11.519
They're just models of historical interest.

03:11.520 --> 03:14.239
Wow, look, FDR!

03:14.240 --> 03:18.239
Right, God! Well,
they're not really my thing, so...

03:18.800 --> 03:22.079
If you bought FDR, we could
get together and model Yalta.

03:22.080 --> 03:23.919
Yeah? I mean...

03:23.920 --> 03:26.879
I suppose, if you were really... keen.

03:26.880 --> 03:29.599
'I do want the FDR doll,

03:29.600 --> 03:31.639

Of course. It's for my son,
he's a big fan of the New Deal, so...

03:41.160 --> 03:45.039
Just grab us a couple of Cybermen
while you're up on your stoolthere.

03:45.040 --> 03:46.519
They'renot for playing with.

03:46.520 --> 03:49.679
No, just going to keep them in
mint condition in their boxes.

03:49.680 --> 03:52.999
Yeah, course you are, mate.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.199
We wanted to say thank you

03:54.200 --> 03:56.479
for being there for Zahra
while I was unconscious.

03:56.480 --> 03:57.839
for being there for Zahra while I
was unconscious. Oh, no worries.

03:57.840 --> 04:01.839
'How can I steal your girlfriend?
How can I steel your girlfriend?'

04:01.880 --> 04:04.119
I tell you, though, man, my pace of life.

04:04.120 --> 04:07.799
Sometimes you need to pull a coma
just to chow down on some chilling.

04:07.800 --> 04:08.959
Word.

04:08.960 --> 04:11.599

when you were unconscious.'

04:11.600 --> 04:12.319
'That was a great look for you.'

'That was a great look for you.
' We want to show you our gratitude, Jez.

04:14.760 --> 04:15.559
Mmm, we want to make you an offer.

04:15.560 --> 04:17.079
Mmm, we want to make you an offer.
'Threesome? Probably.

04:17.079 --> 04:20.238
'Like being offered a tiramisu and
a dead kitten on the same plate.'

04:20.240 --> 04:23.199
Did Zahra tell you about my website?
It's a music portal.

04:23.200 --> 04:27.159
Five-figure hit rate.
Hey, I must be doing something right.

04:27.160 --> 04:29.039
'Massive twat!'

04:29.040 --> 04:32.519
I've always believed the internet
is actually going to be pretty big.

04:32.520 --> 04:35.199
I could use someone to
do website management.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.599
'I don't want a job.'

04:36.600 --> 04:40.319
I don't work there, but I'm around
all the time. It's like a family.

04:40.320 --> 04:42.359
I would like a job.

04:42.360 --> 04:45.279
You'll be focused on keeping
the portal ticking over,

04:45.280 --> 04:46.919
but you'd get a little pot
for developing new artists.

04:46.920 --> 04:49.239
but you'd get a little pot for developing
new artists. I'd be...head of the label?

04:49.240 --> 04:53.239
Yeah, I guess, Jez, you'd be head
of the label. Great, well, er...

04:53.480 --> 04:56.679
'This is brilliant!
I could do the job, have an affair,

04:56.680 --> 05:00.679
'juggle them both till it all
blows up in my stupid face!'

05:00.920 --> 05:04.639
Yes, Shakira, I'm Jeremy,
and you're actually very much too poppy

05:04.640 --> 05:08.639
for my taste. But if you suck this,
I might put you out on my label.

05:09.280 --> 05:12.559
Put FDR next to Stalin, like that,
and I can put a cyber man here.

05:12.560 --> 05:14.559
Doof, doof, doof, doof, doof, doof, doof.

05:14.560 --> 05:15.519
What's that?

05:15.520 --> 05:17.399
That's just cyber man attacking Roosevelt.

05:17.400 --> 05:21.399
I feel uneasy about the noises, Gerard.
Anyway, would a cyber man attack Roosevelt?

05:22.640 --> 05:25.839
He's a cyber man, Mark,
he's devoid of all human emotion,

05:25.840 --> 05:29.319
concerned only with the
preservation of his own race,

05:29.320 --> 05:31.879
of course he'd attack Roosevelt.
Doof, doof, doof, doof.

05:33.480 --> 05:36.439
Oh, hi, Jez.

05:36.440 --> 05:38.479
Sorry to interrupt you playing, boys.

05:38.480 --> 05:42.479
We're not, we're just arranging
our models with some noises.

05:42.680 --> 05:46.319
Anyway, what are you doing back from
your new job so early? Fired already?

05:46.320 --> 05:50.319
I'm back so early because I have the
coolest job in the world, and Ben
is the coolest boss in the world.

05:51.400 --> 05:54.479
I asked him when I should come in tomorrow,
and he said, "Whenever you can make it."

05:54.480 --> 05:57.279
His motto is, "The work never starts".

05:57.280 --> 05:59.279
That's his motto?
What's his annual turnover?

05:59.280 --> 06:02.159
Who gives a shit? We don't
make money, money makes us.

06:02.160 --> 06:03.879
What does that even mean?

06:03.880 --> 06:07.879
It means I'm going to light up a fatty
and crack open my brand new X-Box.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.639
Good luck with the regression session.

06:09.640 --> 06:13.639
Look, I'm sorry if, in an
infantilised world I've somehow
ended up with the non-cool toys,

06:14.960 --> 06:18.279
but why exactly is arranging a
model of the greatest liberal

06:18.280 --> 06:21.799
hero of the 20th Century somehow
less cool than pretending

06:21.800 --> 06:25.679
on a computer that you're a Russian
pimp stealing imaginary cars?

06:25.680 --> 06:27.439
I dunno, dude, I don't make the rules.

06:27.440 --> 06:30.079
Enjoy playing soldiers and
wanking over Dobby on Facebook.

06:30.080 --> 06:34.079
Oh, for God's sake, Jeremy,
that's disgusting.

06:34.400 --> 06:37.279
Did you ever actually...

06:37.280 --> 06:39.839
Well, you know, on occasion.

06:39.840 --> 06:42.639
Corfu '06? It's cool, man.

06:42.640 --> 06:46.639
I mean, I've never actually
gone that far myself, but...

06:46.640 --> 06:49.239
Everything's cool in Dobby Club.

07:24.320 --> 07:27.519
Hi guys, thanks for tipping
us off about tonight. Mental!

07:27.520 --> 07:28.919
'Our pleasure.'

07:28.920 --> 07:30.359
Yeah, the band were incredible.

07:30.360 --> 07:31.759
Yes, we saw you dancing.

07:31.760 --> 07:33.519
Weren't they amazing?

07:33.520 --> 07:35.719
Sorry, Dobs, did you really...?

07:35.720 --> 07:37.839
I thought we were dancing sarcastically.

07:37.840 --> 07:41.279
Oh, no, that was my real dancing.

07:41.280 --> 07:43.079
Did you not like them?

07:43.080 --> 07:44.519
That was your actual dancing?

07:44.520 --> 07:47.639
Yes, it's funny, isn't it,
when one half of a couple likes something,

07:47.640 --> 07:49.559
but the other just doesn't get it?

07:49.560 --> 07:52.039
Well, opposites attract.

07:52.040 --> 07:56.039
'The cracks are starting to show!
The cracks are starting to show!'

07:56.400 --> 08:00.399
So, listen, you know, since you invited
me out of the band, I've got this job.

08:01.680 --> 08:04.919
Yeah, we heard. Yeah,
it's great you could make it down.

08:04.920 --> 08:08.399
Bit of a weird one, we had to...
invite you out the band.

08:08.400 --> 08:11.039
Yeah, well, eggs is eggs. 'Is that a thing?'

08:11.040 --> 08:13.719
Obviously I've got this development pot.

08:13.720 --> 08:16.399
So, what, you might sign us?
Like we even care.

08:16.400 --> 08:20.159
Look, you're on my radar.
'Ha-ha, I'm the Emperor now!'

08:20.160 --> 08:22.879
But...the look's not really working for me.

08:22.880 --> 08:24.199
What...

08:24.200 --> 08:26.439
kind of look d'you think we should go for?

08:26.440 --> 08:29.479
I was thinking... 'What was
I thinking?' Zoot suits.

08:29.480 --> 08:30.639
Zoot suits?

08:30.640 --> 08:34.639
Definitely zoot suits, and...
Also the name. I mean Man Feelings?

08:36.400 --> 08:39.719
That's our USP, cos we're all men,
and we have feelings.

08:39.720 --> 08:43.279
We're a group of men with
feelings who play in a band.

08:43.280 --> 08:46.199
We're like the Chilli Peppers, or the...

08:46.200 --> 08:48.879
can't think of another band
full of dudes right now, but...

08:48.880 --> 08:50.759
there are loads.

08:50.760 --> 08:52.559
Mmm, I was thinking
something more distinctive.

08:52.560 --> 08:54.399
Like what?

08:54.400 --> 08:58.399
Like... Danny Dyers Chocolate Homunculus.

08:58.400 --> 09:01.879
Danny Dyers Chocolate Homunculus?

09:01.880 --> 09:03.279
Is it a deal breaker?

09:03.280 --> 09:05.359
It could be a deal breaker.

09:05.360 --> 09:09.279
It's certainly a game changer.
'Oh, I sound so important.'

09:09.280 --> 09:13.279
Suit yourselves, boys, I've got
other fish to fry in my frying pan.

09:13.920 --> 09:15.559
'Sweet exit line.

09:15.560 --> 09:17.959
'Now, to find the exit.
I can't really see a thing with these on.

09:17.960 --> 09:20.599
'Ooh, can I turn that into a
little dance? No, play it cool.'

09:20.600 --> 09:23.439
Jez, look, if you sign us,

09:23.440 --> 09:26.719
I'll persuade them about the
suits and go with the name. Deal?

09:26.720 --> 09:29.679
Yeah, there is one other thing.

09:29.680 --> 09:32.039
Your bongo guy...

09:32.040 --> 09:36.039
He sucks ass. You need a shit hot bongista,

09:36.800 --> 09:40.799
and I think I know where to find one.

09:43.360 --> 09:44.959
You get me?

09:44.960 --> 09:46.759
Nice work, bringing up
renewable energy, Gerard.

09:46.760 --> 09:49.839
Looks like they're having a
full and frank discussion.

09:49.840 --> 09:53.839
Simple bit of research.
Someone's winning out of climate change.

09:54.440 --> 09:58.439
But listen, Mark, we ought to decide,
you know, if it breaks down,

09:58.720 --> 10:01.519
which of the Dobby Club
gets first dibs on Dobs.

10:01.520 --> 10:03.039
Oh, right, yeah, good point.

10:03.040 --> 10:05.079
'This is it, this is my Yalta.

10:05.080 --> 10:09.079
'Dobby's Poland, I'm wily Stalin,
out-foxing sickly FDR.'

10:09.600 --> 10:11.159
What say you to a coin toss?

10:11.160 --> 10:14.479
Why not? 'Except, is FDR dead by Yalta?

10:14.480 --> 10:17.359
'Gerard's Truman with the A-bomb.

10:17.360 --> 10:19.559
'Relax Mark,
not actually at Yalta.'

10:19.560 --> 10:20.639
Heads or tails?

10:20.640 --> 10:22.519
Heads, obviously. 'If I win, I win.

10:22.520 --> 10:24.839
'If I lose, I'll simply ignore it.

10:24.840 --> 10:27.159
'Stalin's prerogative.'

10:27.160 --> 10:29.839
Oh, heads. You win, Mark.

10:29.840 --> 10:33.519
Too bad. Well, to this
unshakable pact of brothers,

10:33.520 --> 10:37.519
do we swear enduring honour? Yes?

10:39.080 --> 10:42.479
Dobby. Where in cyberspace are you?

10:42.480 --> 10:44.879
No updates for 72 hours.

10:44.880 --> 10:47.039
Is this a bit like stalking?

10:47.040 --> 10:49.159
Stalking's a very loaded term.

10:49.160 --> 10:51.679
I prefer to think of it as extreme liking.

10:51.680 --> 10:52.959
Hiya.

10:52.960 --> 10:55.879
Jez? It's 12 on a Saturday

10:55.880 --> 10:59.119
and you're up, you've been out.
Are you tripping?

10:59.120 --> 11:02.479
Ben rang at seven,
he wanted me to go into the office.

11:02.480 --> 11:04.239
But I thought work never starts.

11:04.240 --> 11:07.679
Yeah, well, apparently work never starts,
but work never stops.

11:07.680 --> 11:08.719
Never stops?

11:08.720 --> 11:09.919
He's got me by the Blackberries.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.639
Turning it off is a sackable offence.

11:11.640 --> 11:14.599
If I go to a funeral I
can switch it to vibrate.

11:14.600 --> 11:15.919
Well, that's something.

11:15.920 --> 11:17.199
Plus, it turns out the website,

11:17.200 --> 11:18.879
you know, it's really
mainly about the merch.

11:18.880 --> 11:22.399
Merch?Merchandise.
Ben says, "I'm all about the merch.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.839
"Cut me and I bleed merch."
I can't believe I had him at my mercy

11:24.840 --> 11:28.119
in the hospital and I let him go.

11:28.120 --> 11:29.799
If I'd known he was such an arsehole,
I'd at least have given

11:29.800 --> 11:31.479
his tube a little waggle.

11:31.480 --> 11:33.839
Yeah, murdering your enemies
is quite a simple solution,

11:33.840 --> 11:37.719
which, I guess, is why in ethics
and law it's so frowned upon.

11:37.720 --> 11:39.439
He wasn't even there,
it was just me and the servers.

11:39.440 --> 11:42.919
After a while I started to pretend
that I was a robot, and then...

11:42.920 --> 11:44.839
I sort of couldn't remember whether

11:44.840 --> 11:47.719
I was a robot, or not,
so I had to get out of there.

11:47.720 --> 11:51.719
Anyway, I nicked you some manila envelopes,
cos I know you like

11:52.160 --> 11:55.079
to stockpile them and...

11:55.080 --> 11:57.639
Ooh, Mark, is that OK, by the shredder?

11:57.640 --> 11:59.839
Can babies go by shredders?

11:59.840 --> 12:02.359
Yes, of course.
Safest place for him.

12:02.360 --> 12:03.879
Stable temperature.

12:03.880 --> 12:07.879
Plus, if there was an earth tremor,
which obviously there isn't going
to be, he's got added protection.

12:09.080 --> 12:09.959
Ah!

12:09.960 --> 12:12.519
I've got him for the day.
It's amazing, the bond.

12:12.520 --> 12:15.919
Earlier I was changing him,
and he pissed all over me.

12:15.920 --> 12:18.119
No ill feeling. Nothing.

12:18.120 --> 12:22.119
Wow! Cos you... you're pretty uptight.
I mean you hate people pissing on you.

12:23.800 --> 12:26.919
Exactly. Plus, if you went
for him now I'd stab you.

12:26.920 --> 12:27.799
Great. That's nice.

12:27.800 --> 12:28.679
Stab you in the eyes.

12:28.680 --> 12:29.959
Yeah, all right, I get the picture.

12:29.960 --> 12:31.999
Hey, watch this. Time me.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.999
Imagine the cushion is the baby.

12:39.480 --> 12:43.279
D'you see? If there was a bus coming, I could
strip this beauty in under five seconds.

12:43.280 --> 12:45.239
Great. Tea?

12:45.240 --> 12:49.239
'Course he's happier with the kit, I bet
he wishes the baby was a mortar round.'

12:50.520 --> 12:53.039
Oh, no milk.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.559
Not black tea, I'm not some kind of monster.

12:55.560 --> 12:58.319
Hello, the human cow.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.799
Why not? Luxury milk.

13:00.800 --> 13:04.039
Lady milk, because you deserve it!

13:04.040 --> 13:05.599
Jeremy, come.
Come and look at this.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.999
You have to come and look at this, now!

13:08.000 --> 13:10.319
If it's another alleged error on
Nikita Khrushchev's Wikipedia page,

13:10.320 --> 13:12.839
then I can't say I'm getting
very worked up about it.

13:12.840 --> 13:15.479
This was taken less than half an hour ago.

13:15.480 --> 13:16.239
So?

13:16.240 --> 13:17.559
Dobby's updated.

13:17.560 --> 13:19.319
She's not in a relationship,

13:19.320 --> 13:22.799
but she is at her bloody
sister's birthday do with Gerard.

13:22.800 --> 13:24.039
Right?

13:24.040 --> 13:28.039
He's done the dirty on me, Jez,
he's making a mockery of our
Granita moment. He's Blairing me.

13:28.920 --> 13:32.239
You're no Brown, Mark.
Your hands are made of flesh and blood.

13:32.240 --> 13:35.239
Gordon Brown didn't actually
have a metal fist, it was just...

13:35.240 --> 13:37.479
No? I thought there was something
wrong with his arm, or his...

13:37.480 --> 13:39.959
Yeah? Wasn't there?

13:39.960 --> 13:42.519
Hold on. I didn't think we had any milk.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.079
Er, no, we do.

13:44.080 --> 13:46.799
No, cos I couldn't have any
Sultana Bran this morning.

13:46.800 --> 13:48.399
There's no milk in the fridge.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.239
Except...

13:50.240 --> 13:50.519
Oh!

13:50.520 --> 13:51.439
Mark, relax.

13:51.440 --> 13:52.959
This is Sophie's milk, isn't it?

13:52.960 --> 13:56.559
Think of it as lady milk from the human cow.

13:56.560 --> 13:59.719
Jeremy, this... it's...
it's one step away from cannibalism!

13:59.720 --> 14:03.119
Oh, right, so it's weird to drink
milk from someone you know,

14:03.120 --> 14:05.619
but to drink milk from another species,

14:05.620 --> 14:08.620
some cow that you've never met,
that's fine, is it?

14:08.720 --> 14:10.559
Yes. Yes, it bloody well is!

14:10.560 --> 14:12.399
Well, suit yourself.

14:12.400 --> 14:16.399
Mmm, luxury milk!

14:18.400 --> 14:22.119
Sweet! Just texted Ben,
said I had to go to a funeral,

14:22.120 --> 14:24.879
plus, I've got the squits and you're
in the bathroom having a breakdown.

14:24.980 --> 14:26.899
I threw a lot of shit, see what sticks.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.719
Look at him. He's the worst
kind of snake in the grass.

14:29.720 --> 14:31.319
What a shit!

14:31.320 --> 14:33.639
Obviously I'd betray him like that...

14:33.640 --> 14:34.479
But he didn't know that.

14:34.480 --> 14:36.679
But he didn't know that.
Exactly, Jez, thank you. He...

14:36.680 --> 14:40.399
Oh, my God, he's... That's my idea,
he's using my idea!

14:40.400 --> 14:42.199
You taught him the palm?

14:42.200 --> 14:43.479
But I told you the palm!

14:43.480 --> 14:44.839
He's juicing my balls.

14:44.840 --> 14:47.159
He's trying to screw her with my cock.

14:47.160 --> 14:49.239
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

14:49.240 --> 14:50.599
Shit, Ben.

14:50.600 --> 14:53.599
Ben Ten, the Bento Box.

14:53.600 --> 14:55.199
Yes, I am still at the funeral.

14:55.200 --> 14:58.519
'Great, I've got a front row
seat in the theatre of cruelty.

14:58.520 --> 14:59.839
'Ugh, just watching them

14:59.840 --> 15:02.919
'is making these normally
delicious butterscotch treats

15:02.920 --> 15:04.239
'turn to ash in my mouth.'

15:04.240 --> 15:05.519
That's the whole story.

15:05.520 --> 15:06.799
I'm going in.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.799
Tony B Liar can disregard the UN,

15:08.800 --> 15:12.519
but he can't disregard the Dobby Club.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.239
BABY CRIES

15:14.240 --> 15:15.319
Baby?

15:15.320 --> 15:19.319
Yeah, that's just a baby,
obviously, at the funeral with me.

15:19.560 --> 15:22.439
Don't worry little one, she's in heaven.

15:22.440 --> 15:23.639
Mummy's in heaven now.

15:23.640 --> 15:27.639
'That baby doesn't have a clue
what I'm on about, it's fine.'

15:28.480 --> 15:30.839
Mark, what are... what are you doing here?

15:30.840 --> 15:33.479
I could ask you the very
same question, Judas!

15:33.480 --> 15:36.679
Well, Dobby didn't have anyone
to come to the party with her,

15:36.680 --> 15:38.039
so I volunteered.

15:38.040 --> 15:40.159
How incredibly thoughtful...Brutus!

15:40.160 --> 15:41.159
Yes, well...

15:41.160 --> 15:43.199
You know very well that we had a deal.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.759
'Can't think of another one.'

15:44.760 --> 15:45.879
Double Judas!

15:45.880 --> 15:47.079
Nothing's going on.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.039
We're just having a drink.

15:48.040 --> 15:50.439
We're just having a drink. I think
you're doing a little more than that!

15:50.440 --> 15:54.239
No doubt once you've finished these,
and she's sufficiently high

15:54.240 --> 15:57.599
on E numbers, you'll try and supply
her with another pork product

15:57.600 --> 16:00.639
whose name I don't think
needs to be said out loud.

16:00.640 --> 16:02.039
I'm sorry, Mark, OK?

16:02.040 --> 16:05.359
I saw a window of opportunity,
and went for it. You'd do the same.

16:05.360 --> 16:07.519
Unlike you, Gerard, I'm a man of my word.

16:07.520 --> 16:10.159
The Dobby Club is officially dissolved.

16:10.160 --> 16:12.679
What about the HMS Victory?

16:12.680 --> 16:15.719
I shall complete the HMS Victory
without your assistance.

16:15.720 --> 16:17.679
You can't handle the rigging alone.

16:17.680 --> 16:20.359
You had your chance to help
me with that rigging...

16:20.360 --> 16:21.399
and you blew it.

16:21.400 --> 16:22.599
Yeah, yeah, I'm hoping

16:22.600 --> 16:25.519
people might affectionately
call them the Homunculi.

16:25.520 --> 16:27.159
I'll sign them after the gig.

16:27.160 --> 16:31.159
No, no need for you to come, dude.
No, just check out the web page.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.599
But ignore all the shitty comments,

16:33.600 --> 16:36.279
they were all made by the
same 30 to 40 people,

16:36.280 --> 16:37.919
so they don't really count.

16:37.920 --> 16:38.959
Mark?

16:38.960 --> 16:40.279
What the fuck?Hello.

16:40.280 --> 16:41.359
Where's Gerard?

16:41.360 --> 16:43.399
Gerard had to go.

16:43.400 --> 16:45.479
He was...taken ill.

16:45.480 --> 16:46.759
Really? Is it serious?

16:46.760 --> 16:49.559
A bit, but also you needn't
give it a second thought.

16:49.560 --> 16:51.279
The squits.

16:51.280 --> 16:54.079
'No further details required.' May I?

16:54.080 --> 16:55.759
You just happened to be in Epsom?

16:55.760 --> 16:58.399
Yeah, I was in the car, I'm on standby.

16:58.400 --> 16:59.359
Standby?

16:59.360 --> 17:01.239
Standby? As Gerard's replacement.

17:01.240 --> 17:04.199
It's cool, we look out for
one another, like me and Jez.

17:04.200 --> 17:06.839
He's right over there, so if, God forbid,

17:06.839 --> 17:09.959
something should happen,
he'll be there to replace me.

17:09.960 --> 17:12.559
I have to say, I'm mildly
freaking my noggin right now.

17:12.560 --> 17:15.598
Look, Dobby, the truth is,

17:15.599 --> 17:18.439
me and Gerard, we have a...

17:18.440 --> 17:21.239
a sort of a club about you.

17:21.240 --> 17:22.159
A club?

17:22.160 --> 17:24.398
A club? It's not a real club,
there's no clubhouse

17:24.400 --> 17:26.118
and there's only two of us.

17:26.119 --> 17:29.439
It's more of a shared passion, if you will.

17:29.440 --> 17:33.039
It's quite sophisticated,
like the Sunday Times Wine Club.

17:33.040 --> 17:34.559
But it's ironic too, so...

17:34.560 --> 17:36.039
'Hmm, not nailing this.'

17:36.040 --> 17:37.599
So Gerard's not ill then?

17:37.600 --> 17:38.799
No more than usual.

17:38.800 --> 17:42.799
He agreed to step aside,
abort your date and let me have a pop.

17:43.640 --> 17:44.719
A pop?

17:44.720 --> 17:48.079
Not a pop, a go, a turn.
'Really not nailing this at all.'

17:48.080 --> 17:48.759
BABY GRIZZLES

17:48.760 --> 17:49.799
BABY GRIZZLES Excuse me.

17:49.800 --> 17:53.719
Hello, how are you? Hungry,
or another one of your dirty protests?

17:53.720 --> 17:55.839
Oh, no, you're good,
just a blanket.

17:55.840 --> 17:56.879
Ahh!

17:56.880 --> 17:59.079
'Oh, OK. Of course.'

17:59.080 --> 18:01.359
If you like, you can...

18:01.360 --> 18:02.439
smell my baby.

18:02.440 --> 18:03.199
Yeah?

18:03.200 --> 18:07.119
Yeah? That new baby smell, it's amazing.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.799
It's like...caramel and roses.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.399
'Total Emperor's New Clothes.

18:10.400 --> 18:13.119
'They smell of baby soap
and very faintly of urine.'

18:13.120 --> 18:14.479
Mmm!

18:14.480 --> 18:18.119
'Nice, the ultimate aphrodisiac.
My son's like a huge oyster.'

18:18.120 --> 18:21.879
Look, the truth is, I came out here
because I was insane with jealousy

18:21.880 --> 18:25.599
and if that's freaky
then I'll just go, but...

18:25.600 --> 18:29.359
the thing about driving for
miles to spy on someone is that,

18:29.360 --> 18:30.439
if nothing else,

18:30.440 --> 18:34.039
it does sort of prove that you
have quite strong feelings.

18:34.040 --> 18:36.079
Yeah? Me and Kerry hitched to Carlisle

18:36.080 --> 18:38.279
just cos they had this wicked big Halfords.

18:38.280 --> 18:41.639
Look, if there's nothing
happening with you and Gerard,

18:41.640 --> 18:44.799
does that actually mean that there's a...

18:44.800 --> 18:48.439
position vacant as your boyfriend?

18:48.440 --> 18:51.719
What an incredibly off-putting
way of putting it. If I say yes,

18:51.720 --> 18:55.719
will you stop saying things
which are turning my stomach?

18:56.600 --> 18:57.839
'Oh, my God, I've won!

18:57.840 --> 19:01.839
'I'm resigning from the
FDR Cyberman conflict!'

19:02.280 --> 19:04.559
And you're sure these are zoot suits?

19:04.560 --> 19:06.479
Yeah, these are zoot suits.

19:06.480 --> 19:09.079
Yeah. I mean I love them,
obviously, it's just...

19:09.080 --> 19:10.519
I thought they'd be more...

19:10.520 --> 19:14.119
We spent yesterday going round
15 vintage clothing outfitters,

19:14.120 --> 19:16.519
spending 530 quid on zoot suits.

19:16.520 --> 19:18.839
These are definitely fucking zoot suits.

19:18.840 --> 19:20.399
Yeah, great, I...

19:20.400 --> 19:22.359
I love them. So I got the contract,

19:22.360 --> 19:24.679
you still want to do the punk thing?

19:24.680 --> 19:26.119
I only sign in blood.

19:26.120 --> 19:27.239
Hey, Jez? >

19:27.240 --> 19:30.359
Zara, you came! In time to see me play.

19:30.360 --> 19:31.319
You're playing?

19:31.320 --> 19:33.039
You're playing? I'm sure I
told you I was in a band.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.879
Yeah, but you told me you were a poet

19:34.880 --> 19:37.319
and you couldn't find
your exercise book so...

19:37.320 --> 19:38.839
Wow, Jez, I love musicians.

19:38.840 --> 19:42.359
Well, I'm a musician,
so I guess you must love me.

19:42.360 --> 19:45.839
'Is that a joke, or just a genuine
wish with me laughing at the end?'

19:45.840 --> 19:46.919
Hey Jez.

19:46.920 --> 19:50.439
Great, Mr Ben, the Homunculi welcome you.

19:50.440 --> 19:53.079
Need to talk business, babe.
Get yourself a drink.

19:53.080 --> 19:57.079
Mine's a large one,
as you fucking know! (LAUGHS)

19:57.120 --> 19:59.799
So I just wanted to flag
up with you about the band.

19:59.800 --> 20:02.399
I'm going to be taking a
much more hands-on role

20:02.400 --> 20:04.759
than your traditional exec. In fact...

20:04.760 --> 20:05.959
Forget the band,
I'm not signing these twats.

20:05.960 --> 20:07.159
Forget the band, I'm not
signing these twats. What?

20:07.160 --> 20:09.199
I listened to the link, they're shit.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.919
The branding! Do you even
know what a homunculus is?

20:11.920 --> 20:14.039
Isn't it a chick born with a dick?

20:14.040 --> 20:17.359
It's one of those tiny humans
mad scientists keep in jars.

20:17.360 --> 20:19.119
Who wants that on a baseball cap?

20:19.120 --> 20:20.439
Er, goths?

20:20.440 --> 20:21.519
Losey arseholes.

20:21.520 --> 20:22.839
PHONE RINGS

20:22.840 --> 20:25.199
'Fucking great, I've got to fire myself!

20:25.200 --> 20:26.639
'I wonder how I'll take it?

20:26.640 --> 20:27.719
'Very badly, I should imagine.'

20:27.720 --> 20:28.759
'Very badly, I should imagine.' Aagghh!

20:28.760 --> 20:31.359
OK, guys, so here's the thing...

20:31.360 --> 20:34.119
Yeah, I'm...
losing quite a bit here,

20:34.120 --> 20:37.239
so if we could just sign and
break out the Elastoplast.

20:37.240 --> 20:41.119
Yeah. Look, I've been
thinking with my thinking cap,

20:41.120 --> 20:44.359
and basically, yeah, we're a great band,

20:44.360 --> 20:48.319
and obviously I could sign us,
of course I could.

20:48.320 --> 20:51.399
I could sign us a thousand times over.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.039
But are we hungry enough?

20:53.040 --> 20:55.759
I mean, sure, we're hungry,
but are we ravenous?

20:55.760 --> 20:56.799
Because...

20:56.800 --> 20:57.479
Did you fire them yet? >

20:57.480 --> 20:58.599
Did you fire them yet?
> Firing them now, Ben.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.319
You what? Bollocks.

21:00.320 --> 21:02.359
You don't fire us, we fire you.

21:02.360 --> 21:03.399
You're fired!

21:03.400 --> 21:04.559
No, you're fired.

21:04.560 --> 21:06.519
I mean all of us. We're fired.

21:06.520 --> 21:10.519
But we're all in this together
against the fucking suits...

21:12.080 --> 21:14.079
who are me, so...

21:14.080 --> 21:15.519
fuck me!

21:15.520 --> 21:18.159
Why don't we show me what I'm missing

21:18.160 --> 21:21.199
and do the best gig of our lives?

21:21.200 --> 21:23.599
Yeah?!

21:23.600 --> 21:25.239
'Wow, this is it, the ultimate.

21:25.240 --> 21:28.079
'I'm in a relationship
with someone I really like.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.799
'Something's obviously
going to have to go wrong,

21:30.800 --> 21:32.079
'I wonder what it'll be?

21:32.080 --> 21:34.799
'It's almost definitely
going to be something I do.

21:34.800 --> 21:36.879
'I need to watch myself like a hawk.'

21:36.880 --> 21:40.719
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

21:40.720 --> 21:42.359
Hello, Brockley.

21:42.360 --> 21:43.799
I have an announcement.

21:43.800 --> 21:47.799
Danny Dyer's Chocolate Homunculus is dead...

21:48.200 --> 21:50.039
..but Man Feelings are back.

21:50.040 --> 21:54.039
You are witnesses at the
rebirth of Man Feelings.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.999
'Is she thinking about her ex?

21:58.000 --> 22:00.159
'I bet she bloody is. When she goes quiet,

22:00.160 --> 22:02.479
'is she always thinking about him?'

22:02.480 --> 22:04.199
Are you having a look, there?

22:04.200 --> 22:06.959
What? Yeah, just...looking.

22:06.960 --> 22:09.599
'It's impossible to know what's in her head

22:09.600 --> 22:12.319
'and if I ask her,
she might not tell the truth.

22:12.320 --> 22:15.559
So...come on, what are you thinking, Dobs?

22:15.560 --> 22:18.479
Oh, just... I mean...

22:18.480 --> 22:21.359
I wonder how long the cider
craze is going to last?

22:21.360 --> 22:24.599
Right, yeah. Me too.

22:24.600 --> 22:25.679
'Oh, sure!

22:25.680 --> 22:27.439
'Why is she a separate entity?

22:27.440 --> 22:30.399
'There should be a viewing
platform to see into her brain.

22:30.400 --> 22:33.959
'If only I could get her brain in a jar,
or hook her up to electrodes.

22:33.960 --> 22:36.399
'I need thermal imaging of her brain cortex

22:36.400 --> 22:37.839
'and a lab to analyse it.

22:37.840 --> 22:40.719
'Then I could finally relax.'

22:40.720 --> 22:42.119
'Right, suited and booted.

22:42.120 --> 22:44.479
'Yeah, I'm just a band member running late

22:44.480 --> 22:47.879
'because there was one last line
of coke that needed snorting.

22:47.880 --> 22:49.799
'Just slide this up on here.

22:49.800 --> 22:52.559
'Yeah, that's right, honey,
one foot in the band.'

22:52.560 --> 22:54.079
(MOUTHS)

22:54.080 --> 22:57.239
'I'm re-joining you by the power
of standing right by you.'

22:57.240 --> 22:58.559
MUSIC STOPS

22:58.560 --> 23:00.959
Sorry, everyone. Just to clear something up,

23:00.960 --> 23:02.919
this is the band area,

23:02.920 --> 23:04.479
we are the band.

23:04.480 --> 23:06.679
This imaginary line at the edge of the stage

23:06.680 --> 23:08.839
is where the band ends.

23:08.840 --> 23:12.839
He is not in the band,
he is merely dressed like the band.

23:14.280 --> 23:16.479
MUSIC STARTS AGAIN

23:16.480 --> 23:18.919
I hope me and you being anitem

23:18.920 --> 23:21.279
doesn't ruin my friendship with Gerard.

23:21.280 --> 23:25.079
Me too. That... That would be terrible.

23:25.080 --> 23:28.279
'Ugh, the ghost at the feast.
I'm going to kill you, Gerard.

23:28.280 --> 23:30.159
'Kill you till you're dead.'

23:30.160 --> 23:33.839
Although there is something
that I should probably tell you.

23:33.840 --> 23:34.399
What?

23:34.400 --> 23:35.599
What? I don't want to say.

23:35.600 --> 23:36.999
Go on, Mark.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.999
Well...you know those Corfu pictures
that you've got on your profile?

23:41.320 --> 23:43.759
I think maybe you should take those down.

23:43.760 --> 23:45.759
Corfu '06? Why?

23:45.760 --> 23:49.759
Well, Gerard admitted that
sometimes he looks at them and...

23:51.040 --> 23:52.559
does a...

23:52.560 --> 23:53.519
Ugh!

23:53.520 --> 23:56.359
Ugh! I know.

23:56.360 --> 23:59.679
'Never pick a fight with Stalin, Gerard.

23:59.680 --> 24:03.679
'Uncle Joe don't play by your rules.'
