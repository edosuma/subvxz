WEBVTT

00:07.703 --> 00:09.879
Princess: Yo!

00:09.922 --> 00:11.185
'Sup?!

00:11.794 --> 00:13.622
Yumiko: Who are you?

00:13.665 --> 00:16.146
What do you want?Excuse me?

00:16.190 --> 00:18.192
You guys were the onescalling out and making a racket.

00:18.235 --> 00:19.541
I thought you needed help,

00:19.584 --> 00:21.064
but now you're acting
like I'm the one

00:21.108 --> 00:22.413
causing a problem here?

00:22.457 --> 00:25.503
Damn. I haven't seen anyone
in over a year,

00:25.547 --> 00:29.246
and the first ones I find
seem like a bunch of meanies.

00:29.290 --> 00:31.074
You just caught us
off guard.

00:31.118 --> 00:34.251
We didn't know
if you were attacking --Seriously?

00:34.295 --> 00:37.254
If I wanted to attack,
I'd hold the gun like this --

00:37.298 --> 00:39.517
with the dangerous part
pointed at you, see?

00:39.561 --> 00:41.476
That's for attacking.

00:41.519 --> 00:44.087
The other way,
that's for hello.

00:44.131 --> 00:47.960
So, as we can all agree,
I wasn't attacking.

00:48.004 --> 00:51.138
But now...

00:51.181 --> 00:53.270
Now I'm not so sure.

00:53.314 --> 00:54.880
Maybe that's up to you.

00:54.924 --> 00:56.665
Are you gonna hurt me?

00:56.708 --> 00:58.275
Keep pointing the damn gunat us, and you'll find out.

00:58.319 --> 01:02.540
No one has any intention
of hurting you.

01:04.412 --> 01:07.545
We were just admiring
your displays.

01:07.589 --> 01:10.113
Are they yours?

01:10.157 --> 01:12.202
Crap. Sorry.

01:12.246 --> 01:13.812
Do you like 'em?

01:13.856 --> 01:16.032
Yeah, not many rotters
left in the city,

01:16.076 --> 01:18.295
so I put these up
as my decorations.

01:18.339 --> 01:20.297
Pain in the ass
to put together,

01:20.341 --> 01:22.734
but they make the place
feel more alive.

01:22.778 --> 01:27.304
Although now that I've met
actual live people again --

01:27.348 --> 01:29.915
Hold on.

01:29.959 --> 01:32.309
You guys are real,
right?

01:33.571 --> 01:35.573
Is that supposedto be a joke?I dunno.

01:35.617 --> 01:37.140
I mean,
I never hallucinated before,

01:37.184 --> 01:38.620
but there's a first time
for everything.

01:38.663 --> 01:40.187
Uh, say something
I wouldn't know.

01:40.230 --> 01:42.058
Like, uh...

01:42.102 --> 01:44.147
what's the capital
of Pennsylvania?

01:44.191 --> 01:45.627
Harrisburg.

01:45.670 --> 01:47.194
Did I know that?

01:47.237 --> 01:48.499
I think I knew that.

01:48.543 --> 01:51.154
Ha!
Maybe I am hallucinating.

01:51.198 --> 01:52.721
This is --
This is wild.Hey.

01:52.764 --> 01:54.592
You certain
it's just you out here?

01:54.636 --> 01:56.203
Didn't I already
tell you that?

01:56.246 --> 01:58.335
I've been on my own
for over a year,

01:58.379 --> 02:01.251
and it totally sucks.

02:01.295 --> 02:03.601
Da-- Damn.
I should be nicer.

02:03.645 --> 02:06.213
Talking to
possibly real people again

02:06.256 --> 02:07.388
is making me freak out.

02:07.431 --> 02:09.172
You -- I'm just --

02:09.216 --> 02:10.608
I'm just gonna shut up.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.397
I'm Juanita Sanchez.

02:16.440 --> 02:18.181
But I never liked
the name Juanita.

02:18.225 --> 02:20.183
You can call me Princess.

02:20.227 --> 02:21.880
Why "Princess"?

02:21.924 --> 02:24.622
Because "Queen"
makes me sound old.

02:24.666 --> 02:26.363
And pretentious.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.674
Ezekiel: It's a pleasureto meet you, Princess.

02:32.717 --> 02:35.459
I am...Ezekiel.

02:35.503 --> 02:38.027
And these are my friends,Eugene and Yumiko.

02:38.070 --> 02:39.333
Wow!

02:39.376 --> 02:41.204
Let me show
you guys around.

02:41.248 --> 02:43.772
We got plenty of space
for you to chill out,

02:43.815 --> 02:45.208
put your feet up.

02:45.252 --> 02:48.037
Y'all need supplies?
You need food?

02:48.080 --> 02:49.430
Hair dye?

02:49.473 --> 02:51.388
I've got a neat place
for us to swim

02:51.432 --> 02:53.216
a couple blocks away.

02:53.260 --> 02:55.392
We appreciate the hospitality,but we can't stay.

02:55.436 --> 02:57.786
Oh. O-Okay.

02:57.829 --> 02:59.396
We're ona very important mission.

02:59.440 --> 03:00.876
Ohhh?!
What sorta mission?

03:00.919 --> 03:02.617
Uh,
that's our business.

03:02.660 --> 03:04.662
Well, let me least show you
the best way through the city.

03:04.706 --> 03:06.708
No, thank you.Oh, come on.
Why not?

03:06.751 --> 03:09.406
Because we don't know you.

03:09.450 --> 03:11.103
Of course you do.

03:11.147 --> 03:13.584
Princess?

03:13.628 --> 03:15.499
I'm great.
You'll see.

03:20.374 --> 03:23.159
Watch how helpful I can be.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.291
No, wait. Please!

03:24.334 --> 03:25.640
Don't --

03:33.517 --> 03:36.390
Eugene: No! No!

03:46.182 --> 03:47.662
Damn.

03:47.705 --> 03:48.967
Uh...

03:49.011 --> 03:51.492
Sorry about that.

04:39.627 --> 04:43.021
Ezekiel: At least
it's not a total loss.

04:43.065 --> 04:45.241
And we can still find
the horses tomorrow.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.721
Not to be a naysayer,

04:46.764 --> 04:49.506
but our rendezvous windowis tighter than a tourniquet.

04:49.550 --> 04:51.334
I have doubtsthat it'll be possible

04:51.378 --> 04:52.509
to make the journey
by foot.

04:52.553 --> 04:54.729
Any additional dayspent on an empty search

04:54.772 --> 04:56.731
would place us onthe failure side of that window.

04:56.774 --> 04:59.516
So, if it's possible to walk,
we start now.

04:59.560 --> 05:02.389
Missing this meeting
isn't an option.

05:02.432 --> 05:05.392
We've got way too many people
counting on us back home.

05:05.435 --> 05:08.699
What about Princess?
She offered to help.

05:08.743 --> 05:09.874
Why don't
we take her up on it?

05:16.316 --> 05:18.143
Absolutely not.

05:18.187 --> 05:19.623
What could it hurt?Plenty.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.190
Anyone alone for this long

05:21.233 --> 05:22.713
ends up selfish, crazy --

05:22.757 --> 05:24.454
in her case, definitely both.

05:25.890 --> 05:27.544
We can't trust her.

05:27.588 --> 05:30.547
I'm not suggesting
that we follow her blindly.

05:30.591 --> 05:32.375
But if she knows how to find
transportation --

05:32.419 --> 05:33.376
Then she wouldn't

05:33.420 --> 05:35.726
still be here, alone.

05:35.770 --> 05:38.250
Look, if she had a ride,
why hasn't she left?

05:38.294 --> 05:39.948
It's a trap.

05:39.991 --> 05:41.428
Is Princess a few bananas

05:41.471 --> 05:42.994
short of a bunch?

05:43.038 --> 05:43.995
Possibly.

05:44.039 --> 05:44.996
Does she have access

05:45.040 --> 05:45.997
to automobiles and working fuel?

05:46.041 --> 05:47.477
Unlikely.

05:47.521 --> 05:49.305
But at present,we possess limited options,

05:49.349 --> 05:52.656
so even a slim possibilityis worth investigating.

05:54.223 --> 05:55.964
Apologies, Yumiko.

05:56.007 --> 05:57.444
My vote's with the king.

06:08.498 --> 06:10.282
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

06:10.326 --> 06:12.284
I feel really bad about
what happened.

06:12.328 --> 06:14.243
Let me make it up
to you guys.

06:14.286 --> 06:16.027
You mentioned you had accessto some transportation?

06:16.071 --> 06:17.333
A whole garage full.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.596
Tons of choices.
I'll take you there.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.555
You want us to follow you,
you hand over your gun.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.342
Really wanna spend time
with living people again,

06:26.386 --> 06:28.344
but I'm not sure
I trust you, either.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.346
I mean, I'm outnumbered.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.130
I could probably take out
one of you,

06:32.174 --> 06:33.654
two if I'm lucky.

06:33.697 --> 06:35.220
But then he'd still be left
to kill me anyways.

06:35.264 --> 06:36.308
So why even try?

06:36.352 --> 06:38.833
Unless I have a death wish,

06:38.876 --> 06:40.617
which, clearly, I don't

06:40.661 --> 06:42.140
because I have been living herealone for so long.

06:42.184 --> 06:43.272
See?

06:48.103 --> 06:51.411
Fine. You can have it.

06:54.370 --> 06:56.111
I know where to find
more guns, anyway.

06:56.154 --> 06:59.331
So, then -- the garage?

06:59.375 --> 07:01.464
Right. Yeah. Of course.

07:01.508 --> 07:03.684
All those in the marketfor a new set of wheels,

07:03.727 --> 07:04.859
follow me!

07:11.909 --> 07:14.172
Selfish.

07:14.216 --> 07:15.478
And crazy.

07:38.893 --> 07:45.682
Whispering Voice:
Wherrrre aaaaarrre theyyy...

08:28.246 --> 08:31.162
He's keeping
the cats away.

08:31.206 --> 08:32.990
Mostly.

08:34.035 --> 08:36.428
Your turn to watch.

08:37.212 --> 08:39.823
Jules: How are you?

08:39.867 --> 08:42.043
Everybody's counting on me.

08:42.086 --> 08:44.306
You'll come through.

08:45.089 --> 08:47.788
You think so?
Yeah.

08:49.224 --> 08:51.356
Hey, guys.

08:51.400 --> 08:54.055
Uh, I need somebodyto run an errand for me.

08:56.797 --> 08:58.581
I'll go.

08:58.625 --> 09:01.279
Daryl: Don't go home.

09:01.323 --> 09:03.586
They'll only find us
if you answer me.

09:03.630 --> 09:06.589
We got a plan to end this.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.243
One I think you'd like.

09:10.985 --> 09:12.769
Man, being on the run
like this,

09:12.813 --> 09:15.598
barely scraping by...

09:15.642 --> 09:19.776
reminds me
of the old gang.

09:19.820 --> 09:22.083
Seems like ages now.

09:25.434 --> 09:27.088
Michonne?

09:27.131 --> 09:31.614
Can you hear me?

09:31.658 --> 09:33.834
Michonne?

10:11.349 --> 10:14.657
No sign of them.
They left quickly.

10:14.701 --> 10:16.311
Couldn't have gone far.

10:16.354 --> 10:19.314
Do we search elsewhere?

10:19.357 --> 10:20.707
Where...

10:20.750 --> 10:23.448
Whispering Voice:
They have nothinggggg...

10:23.492 --> 10:24.928
Theyyyy fleeee...

10:24.972 --> 10:26.669
theyyyy hiiiiide...

10:26.713 --> 10:28.932
Ocean.

11:05.012 --> 11:06.840
Beta:
Prepare the guardians.

11:06.883 --> 11:08.842
We walk.

11:36.652 --> 11:41.091
I thought
all the cats left.

11:41.135 --> 11:43.398
Not this one.

11:45.966 --> 11:47.619
I'm sorry about your mom.

11:53.016 --> 11:54.714
You don't have to be.

11:58.500 --> 11:59.849
You miss her?

11:59.893 --> 12:02.156
No.

12:10.033 --> 12:13.428
Not everyone gets to havea mom like yours.

12:40.107 --> 12:41.717
Hi.

12:41.761 --> 12:42.936
Everything okay?

12:42.979 --> 12:45.025
Yeah, running
to the road for Luke.

12:45.068 --> 12:47.854
And give them
some exercise.

12:58.865 --> 13:00.910
Judith.

13:00.954 --> 13:02.651
What're you doing?I'm fine.

13:03.043 --> 13:03.957
Who you with?

13:04.000 --> 13:05.001
No one.

13:06.089 --> 13:07.656
Come on. We're going back.Let's go.

13:07.699 --> 13:10.659
Please, I wanna stay.No.

13:10.702 --> 13:12.748
I left Father Gabriel
a note.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.837
I swear, it's fine.

13:14.881 --> 13:16.883
No, that wasn't a question.Let's go.

13:16.926 --> 13:19.668
No.

13:19.711 --> 13:21.626
I hate it up there.

13:21.670 --> 13:25.674
Smells like cat pee.

13:25.717 --> 13:30.070
I wanna learn what you do,
how to keep us safe.

13:30.113 --> 13:31.854
In case something happens.

13:35.945 --> 13:38.078
I walk the perimeter.

13:38.121 --> 13:39.949
I look for anything
that looks wrong.

13:39.993 --> 13:41.864
If I find something,I go somewhere safe,

13:41.908 --> 13:44.345
and I radio it in.

13:44.388 --> 13:47.957
There's no room for mistakes,not right now.

13:48.001 --> 13:49.480
I know.

13:51.178 --> 13:52.483
All right.

13:52.527 --> 13:53.876
If you do this with me,

13:53.920 --> 13:55.008
you're gonna do
everything I say,

13:55.051 --> 13:56.444
you're gonna stay
right next to me.

13:56.487 --> 13:57.749
All right?

13:57.793 --> 13:58.881
Promise.

13:58.925 --> 13:59.926
All right. Come on.

14:13.983 --> 14:17.378
This is wrong.

14:19.989 --> 14:23.123
They are not fools.

14:23.166 --> 14:26.822
They expect us.

14:26.866 --> 14:33.916
The path is not clear.

14:33.960 --> 14:37.833
The pack believes
in your wisdom.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.139
They follow the Alpha.

14:40.140 --> 14:42.925
Beta, I mean.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.274
Apologies.

14:44.318 --> 14:45.493
We see her within you.

14:47.625 --> 14:49.627
Waaaaaaait.

15:02.336 --> 15:08.298
Show me.

15:08.342 --> 15:10.953
Show me the path.

15:12.172 --> 15:15.131
Patience...

15:15.697 --> 15:21.050
Haaaave faith
in your strennnngth...

15:21.094 --> 15:23.966
Watch...

15:24.010 --> 15:27.143
Learnnnn...

15:27.187 --> 15:29.972
We walk.

15:30.016 --> 15:32.018
We wait.

15:59.436 --> 16:00.916
Tower, do you copy?

16:00.960 --> 16:03.049
Gabriel: Yes, we copy.

16:03.092 --> 16:06.139
They're heading towardOceanside...as expected.

16:06.182 --> 16:08.445
Any sign of slowing?Not yet.

16:08.489 --> 16:09.838
We'll stay on them.

16:09.881 --> 16:11.361
If anything changes,we'll send word.

16:11.405 --> 16:13.146
Copy that.
Be safe.

16:13.189 --> 16:14.625
Same. Over.

16:21.197 --> 16:23.112
How much longer
do you reckon?

16:23.156 --> 16:24.461
Almost there.

16:24.505 --> 16:26.246
If this is a waste
of our time...

16:26.289 --> 16:28.639
It'll be worth it.
Don't worry!

16:30.076 --> 16:33.383
Make sure you guys
stay close to me,

16:33.427 --> 16:35.864
and please watch your step.

16:45.265 --> 16:46.744
Tres...

16:46.788 --> 16:48.920
Cuatro...

16:48.964 --> 16:50.052
Cinco...

17:07.765 --> 17:10.072
Starting to wonder
if you were right about her.

17:10.116 --> 17:11.943
Oh, I am.

17:11.987 --> 17:14.033
But let's figure outwhat she's up to first.

17:17.297 --> 17:19.777
Cincuenta y cuatro...

17:19.821 --> 17:21.257
Cincuenta y cinco...

17:21.301 --> 17:22.998
Is there
a particular method

17:23.042 --> 17:25.087
behind this
navigational technique,

17:25.131 --> 17:27.089
or are you just
meandering about?

17:29.700 --> 17:32.312
Holy crap.

17:32.355 --> 17:34.140
I think I just
found your horse.

17:37.273 --> 17:38.796
Did walkers eat it?

17:38.840 --> 17:41.321
No, it probably just
stepped on one of the mines.

17:43.149 --> 17:47.979
What do you particularly mean
by the term "mines"?

17:48.023 --> 17:49.590
You know,
those things you step on

17:49.633 --> 17:50.808
and then they go boom.

17:52.636 --> 17:55.248
Are you saying you brought us
into a minefield?

17:55.291 --> 17:57.293
Well, yeah.
But it -- it's a small one.

17:57.337 --> 17:59.295
What's wrong with you?

17:59.339 --> 18:00.731
Why would you keep thatfrom us?

18:00.775 --> 18:02.168
I just didn't
want you to worry.

18:02.211 --> 18:03.169
I told youwe couldn't trust her.

18:03.212 --> 18:04.822
I walk this all the time!

18:04.866 --> 18:07.129
It's no big deal.
I got the route right up here.

18:07.173 --> 18:09.131
So you can get us out?Of course.

18:09.175 --> 18:10.611
As soon as I figure out
where we left off.

18:10.654 --> 18:12.743
Excuse me?

18:12.787 --> 18:14.702
Well, I don't normally stop
in the middle,

18:14.745 --> 18:16.791
so I kinda lost count.

18:16.834 --> 18:18.314
I Just need a minute
to think.

18:18.358 --> 18:20.142
Either you get us
out of here safely,

18:20.186 --> 18:21.361
or I'll kill you
myself.

18:22.449 --> 18:23.841
That's fair.

18:46.908 --> 18:50.346
Ah. Guess not.

18:52.609 --> 18:54.481
Anyone have
an extra canteen?

19:02.489 --> 19:04.099
Carol: Damn it.

19:06.667 --> 19:08.930
Almost have it.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.206
Thanks.

19:24.250 --> 19:25.816
You're welcome.

19:29.690 --> 19:32.780
Thanks for coming.

19:32.823 --> 19:35.304
You don't have to do that.

19:35.348 --> 19:38.307
It's okay.

19:38.351 --> 19:39.700
No, it's not.

19:43.356 --> 19:44.748
If I could go back...

19:46.750 --> 19:49.318
I'm so sorry, Kelly,
for everything.

19:49.362 --> 19:51.059
She's not dead.

19:51.102 --> 19:56.499
She's not.

19:56.543 --> 20:01.678
Maybe it's because
she's so...tough

20:01.722 --> 20:04.420
to survive anything.

20:07.075 --> 20:10.687
Maybe there's justthis part of me that...

20:10.731 --> 20:14.256
won't accept
that she's gone.

20:14.300 --> 20:17.520
And, uh, so...

20:17.564 --> 20:20.088
I understand you.

20:20.131 --> 20:22.873
Why you did...all of it.

20:26.442 --> 20:29.837
It doesn't mean
I should have.

20:33.710 --> 20:38.454
When I startedlosing my hearing...

20:38.498 --> 20:42.545
my sister told methat it wasn't my weakness.

20:42.589 --> 20:45.461
It was my...

20:45.505 --> 20:48.421
superpower.

20:55.819 --> 20:57.995
And now look.

20:58.039 --> 21:02.783
Everyone's learning signbecause of me.

21:02.826 --> 21:07.135
You think that the way you areis -- is a weakness?

21:10.486 --> 21:14.577
I heard the stories about you,in the old days.

21:14.621 --> 21:16.449
We all have.

21:18.712 --> 21:22.977
That you --
you'd just go off.

21:23.020 --> 21:27.198
And do the thingthat only you can do.

21:28.809 --> 21:32.116
Lone wolf.

21:32.160 --> 21:35.206
That's your superpower.

21:35.250 --> 21:38.993
You can't give up everythingabout yourself because...

21:41.430 --> 21:44.564
...bad things happen.

21:46.435 --> 21:47.915
I gotta believe that.

22:02.495 --> 22:03.539
Hey.

22:03.583 --> 22:05.541
I, um...

22:05.585 --> 22:08.109
I don't think you've eaten
anything today.

22:08.588 --> 22:10.241
I'm good.

22:10.285 --> 22:13.157
You know, I can't tellif it's just one of those things

22:13.201 --> 22:17.423
or the craziness of us allmoving to an abandoned tower...

22:17.466 --> 22:19.512
or if you're just
avoiding me.

22:21.427 --> 22:22.558
I'm avoiding you.

22:24.299 --> 22:28.999
Well, shit, that --
that's honest.

22:29.043 --> 22:32.568
You want me to lie?

22:32.612 --> 22:34.004
Make you feel better?

22:36.572 --> 22:38.226
No, I don't.

22:38.269 --> 22:40.794
Okay. Well, you can givesomeone else the rat stew.

22:40.837 --> 22:45.276
It's not rat.
It's possum.

22:45.320 --> 22:49.498
I mean, yeah, basically
a big rat, but I, um...

22:49.542 --> 22:51.805
I just wanted to say...

22:51.848 --> 22:53.415
that I liked her.

22:54.503 --> 22:57.637
Your mom, I mean,
she did some horrible shit

22:57.680 --> 22:59.552
that there's no excusing
any of it, but...

22:59.595 --> 23:02.076
I liked --

23:02.119 --> 23:04.121
I liked a lot of things
about her.

23:04.165 --> 23:07.037
And I wish to God I didn't
have to do what I did.

23:07.081 --> 23:09.257
But if there's something
that you wanna say to me,

23:09.300 --> 23:11.694
then you should say it.

23:14.349 --> 23:16.046
Most of us wish
you'd died, too.

23:38.068 --> 23:39.896
We never should
have followed her.

23:39.940 --> 23:41.637
This is exactly
the kind of thing

23:41.681 --> 23:42.856
I was afraid
would happen.

23:43.987 --> 23:47.687
I have been afraid
of many things.

23:47.730 --> 23:49.558
But this one's new.

23:49.602 --> 23:51.038
Just as an FYI,

23:51.081 --> 23:53.388
we're running out of time
on multiple fronts.

23:55.521 --> 23:57.479
Fence instability
being the most pressing.

23:57.523 --> 23:59.525
But I'm also concerned
with improper mine placement,

23:59.568 --> 24:00.700
which could lead
to a cascade.

24:00.743 --> 24:01.918
Yumiko:
What's a cascade?

24:06.619 --> 24:07.750
Chain reaction.

24:07.794 --> 24:09.404
You don't want to be
stuck in the middle

24:09.448 --> 24:10.971
when more of these puppies
start popping off.

24:11.014 --> 24:12.973
Maybe there's something
I can do.

24:22.983 --> 24:24.419
I'm kinda blowing this,huh?

24:25.725 --> 24:28.728
It's not ideal.

24:28.771 --> 24:31.731
But leading us to safety
could go a long way.

24:31.774 --> 24:33.384
Of course.

24:33.428 --> 24:36.605
I just wanna say
I didn't mean to.

24:36.649 --> 24:37.650
I'm sorry, y'know?

24:41.262 --> 24:43.177
Eeeny, meeny...

24:43.220 --> 24:45.222
What is she doing now?

24:45.266 --> 24:46.920
...please no mine-ys...

24:46.963 --> 24:48.487
Moe.

25:02.588 --> 25:04.981
Whew!
I'm still here.

25:05.025 --> 25:06.374
Cool.

25:06.417 --> 25:08.637
We should be good
from here, guys.

25:28.309 --> 25:29.571
A hunter moves,

25:29.615 --> 25:31.791
everything else
moves around it.

25:31.834 --> 25:34.750
Try to spot things
that don't belong,

25:34.794 --> 25:37.579
things that just don't
feel right.

25:37.623 --> 25:39.146
Now take a look.

25:39.189 --> 25:41.627
Tell me what you see.

25:49.025 --> 25:51.201
Living or dead?

25:52.072 --> 25:53.987
Walker.

25:56.642 --> 25:58.295
They could be
roundin' more up.

25:58.339 --> 26:00.036
Stay behind me.

26:30.719 --> 26:31.894
Daryl: Come on.

26:38.292 --> 26:40.860
Hey! You put our livesin danger back there.

26:40.903 --> 26:42.426
For what?
I didn't.

26:42.470 --> 26:44.080
Let's all just take a --No, no, no, no, no.

26:44.124 --> 26:45.821
Our friends, our families,are depending on us.

26:45.865 --> 26:47.649
She may not have anyoneleft to care about,

26:47.693 --> 26:48.694
but we sure as hell do.

26:48.737 --> 26:50.043
I'm sorry.

26:50.086 --> 26:52.349
Fleetwood Drive.

26:52.393 --> 26:54.700
Ezekiel: What?

26:54.743 --> 26:56.832
We passed Fleetwood Driveearlier.

26:56.876 --> 26:58.660
Uh, must've been
a different Fleetwood.

26:58.704 --> 27:00.662
We've got like five of them
all over the city --

27:00.706 --> 27:03.317
streets, avenues, roads --
it's super confusing.

27:03.360 --> 27:05.536
No, it was most certainlyFleetwood Drive.

27:05.580 --> 27:07.277
I remember seeing the signand saying to myself,

27:07.321 --> 27:08.670
"Granddaddy used to drivea Fleetwood."

27:08.714 --> 27:11.499
Yumiko: You've led us
around all day

27:11.542 --> 27:13.327
when we could've
walked straight here?

27:13.370 --> 27:14.676
Is that true?

27:14.720 --> 27:15.982
Um...

27:16.765 --> 27:18.854
Yumiko --Yumiko: You better tell us
what you're up to,

27:18.898 --> 27:21.291
and maybe
I'll leave you here alive.

27:21.335 --> 27:23.685
Okay, okay, okay.
I might've maybe sort of

27:23.729 --> 27:25.295
missed the turn
onto Fleetwood earlier

27:25.339 --> 27:27.297
but only because I was
having too much fun!

27:27.341 --> 27:29.386
And then I figured,
we could take the scenic route

27:29.430 --> 27:31.737
instead of turning around
and keep the fun going!

27:31.780 --> 27:34.783
Into a minefield.Which looks bad --
I know.

27:34.827 --> 27:37.699
But I'd been through it
like a billion times before,

27:37.743 --> 27:39.875
and I never thought
it was gonna to be a problem

27:39.919 --> 27:41.703
until it was.

27:41.747 --> 27:43.749
All I wanted
was to show you the garage,

27:43.792 --> 27:46.708
and then you'd be like,
"Princess, you're amazing!

27:46.752 --> 27:49.145
We want to stay
and be friends!"

27:49.189 --> 27:50.712
But, no...

27:50.756 --> 27:52.888
I screwed it up.

27:52.932 --> 27:54.411
I see that now.

27:54.455 --> 27:55.543
Yeah.

27:55.586 --> 27:57.371
Shit.

28:00.374 --> 28:01.854
When I was first here,
by myself,

28:01.897 --> 28:03.899
I figured somebody else
would show up eventually.

28:03.943 --> 28:05.161
Odds are, right?

28:05.205 --> 28:06.859
And then days
turned into months.

28:06.902 --> 28:10.340
And it was so empty.
But then I realized,

28:10.384 --> 28:11.646
this isn't that different

28:11.690 --> 28:13.343
from how I felt
before all this.

28:15.215 --> 28:19.088
This one time,
someone told me,

28:19.132 --> 28:22.222
"You're hard to love."

28:22.265 --> 28:23.571
So maybe it's me.

28:23.614 --> 28:25.094
Maybe I deserve this.

28:25.138 --> 28:26.966
And all day,

28:27.009 --> 28:28.794
I kept hearing that little voicein my head --

28:28.837 --> 28:31.144
"It's me."

28:31.187 --> 28:34.800
And I know I should've...
turned around,

28:34.843 --> 28:36.323
or told you guys the truth,

28:36.366 --> 28:37.803
but I didn't want that voice
to be right.

28:39.587 --> 28:40.936
So...

28:40.980 --> 28:43.634
I am sorry.

28:51.947 --> 28:54.341
I have an all-too-familiarsense of how you feel.

29:02.828 --> 29:04.351
I've made poor decisions.

29:04.394 --> 29:07.136
Lied to folks.

29:07.180 --> 29:10.574
The inevitable alternativemeant being left alone.

29:10.618 --> 29:12.838
No one wants that.

29:12.881 --> 29:15.275
Yeah.

29:19.018 --> 29:20.802
Just to clarify --

29:20.846 --> 29:23.631
you do have accessto those wheels, correct?

29:45.218 --> 29:47.394
Throw it over there.

29:47.437 --> 29:49.178
Now.

29:50.571 --> 29:53.400
I will if you pull this
outta me.

29:53.443 --> 29:56.055
I can't die like this.

29:56.098 --> 29:57.665
It ain't natural.

29:57.708 --> 30:00.886
You drop the knife,I'll think about it.

30:04.237 --> 30:05.542
Where're your people?

30:05.586 --> 30:07.457
A few miles east.

30:07.501 --> 30:10.243
Headed to the ocean.

30:10.286 --> 30:12.854
Are they with the horde?

30:12.898 --> 30:13.855
You a scout?

30:13.899 --> 30:16.031
I was...

30:16.075 --> 30:17.685
going off on my own.

30:17.728 --> 30:18.904
Why?

30:18.947 --> 30:21.732
I had no choice.

30:21.776 --> 30:25.562
I love those people,
but he's...

30:25.606 --> 30:28.870
I couldn't stay there.

30:28.914 --> 30:31.351
He's what?

30:31.394 --> 30:32.874
Lost it.

30:32.918 --> 30:36.095
After what you did
to her.

30:36.138 --> 30:39.968
Will you take this out?

30:40.012 --> 30:42.014
Does he know where we are?

30:42.057 --> 30:46.540
I don't know.

30:46.583 --> 30:49.108
But he's gonna keep
coming for you.

30:50.936 --> 30:52.024
You took too much.

30:52.067 --> 30:54.069
No, please.

30:54.113 --> 30:56.115
Please.

30:56.158 --> 30:58.595
I want to walk...after.

30:58.639 --> 31:01.163
Does he know
where we are?

31:01.207 --> 31:03.470
I don't know.

31:03.513 --> 31:05.341
I mean it.

31:21.575 --> 31:23.794
You didn't have to do that.

31:23.838 --> 31:27.798
She didn't have any informationfor us, anyway.

31:27.842 --> 31:29.583
She was gonna die.

31:29.626 --> 31:32.020
Better to be quick.

31:34.153 --> 31:35.154
We're gonna leave her?

31:35.197 --> 31:37.373
Come on.

31:39.549 --> 31:40.811
Maybe she has a family.

31:44.032 --> 31:46.730
Look, if they're only
a few miles away,

31:46.774 --> 31:49.168
maybe we can spot something
from the top of the tower.

31:56.044 --> 31:59.613
Faith. Faith.

31:59.656 --> 32:03.965
Faith. Watch.

32:04.009 --> 32:06.141
Learn.

32:06.185 --> 32:12.147
Whispering Voice: Theyyy fleeee
beforrre youuuu...

32:12.191 --> 32:14.889
Strength...

32:15.150 --> 32:17.022
Strength...

32:21.461 --> 32:25.160
Waaaaatch...

32:29.164 --> 32:31.993
Faaaaith.

32:32.037 --> 32:34.039
Yesssssss...

32:34.082 --> 32:36.041
Faaaaaaith...

32:36.084 --> 32:41.394
will beeeee rewarrrrrded...

32:49.968 --> 32:52.187
Still no sign of slowing?

32:52.231 --> 32:54.189
You think this can work?

32:54.233 --> 32:55.886
This plan?

32:55.930 --> 32:58.280
Has to, doesn't it?

32:58.324 --> 33:00.108
I guess so.

33:03.459 --> 33:05.418
Always thought,

33:05.461 --> 33:08.029
once Alpha was dead...

33:08.073 --> 33:10.945
it'd be easier
to see light.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.207
Past what we lost,
y'know?

33:12.251 --> 33:15.689
I don't know about
seeing past.

33:15.732 --> 33:18.083
But I can fight here,

33:18.126 --> 33:21.651
try to make surewe don't lose again.

33:21.695 --> 33:24.045
For Gracie, Adam.

33:24.089 --> 33:26.265
Whatever it takes.

33:28.093 --> 33:29.877
Then, all this loss will maybe
add up to something --

33:29.920 --> 33:32.010
Hold on.Are they slowing down?

33:34.447 --> 33:37.624
No.

33:37.667 --> 33:39.234
They're changing direction.Toward the tower.

33:39.278 --> 33:40.757
Call it in.
Yeah.

33:46.111 --> 33:48.243
It's no good.

33:48.287 --> 33:50.941
We got to leave -- now.

34:09.134 --> 34:10.787
You don't get to tell me
what to do.

34:12.398 --> 34:14.313
You're right. I can't.

34:14.356 --> 34:17.142
Hey.

34:17.185 --> 34:18.926
I thinkthat you should hit me.

34:18.969 --> 34:20.362
And it will make you
feel better.

34:21.929 --> 34:23.670
I feel fine.

34:23.713 --> 34:26.194
You have to mourn her.

34:26.238 --> 34:28.327
You know,you need to say goodbye.

34:28.370 --> 34:30.546
Otherwise, it's gonnaeat you up from the insides.

34:32.331 --> 34:34.333
Just --Just trust me on this.

34:34.376 --> 34:38.293
Look,she was still your mom.

34:38.337 --> 34:41.688
You know?And we only get the one.

34:41.731 --> 34:44.560
So you --you should hit me...

34:44.604 --> 34:48.260
and just try
to let it out.

34:48.303 --> 34:50.914
Otherwise, you are gonna driftfurther from these people,

34:50.958 --> 34:52.612
and I knowyou don't want that.

34:52.655 --> 34:54.396
The hell do you know
what I want, huh?

34:54.440 --> 34:56.137
Tell me.

34:56.181 --> 34:59.358
You're a selfish asshole.

34:59.401 --> 35:00.489
You only killed her

35:00.533 --> 35:02.839
so they'd think
that you're a hero.

35:02.883 --> 35:05.407
But nothing you do will ever
make you that here!

35:05.451 --> 35:07.322
Because you only care
about yourself.

35:07.366 --> 35:11.196
Even now,
trying to get me to do this?

35:11.239 --> 35:13.154
You liked her?

35:13.198 --> 35:16.244
How the hell can you tell me
you liked her, huh?!

35:16.288 --> 35:17.724
I hated her!

35:17.767 --> 35:19.204
I want to hate her,

35:19.247 --> 35:22.381
so screw you for telling me
I can't even do that!

35:22.424 --> 35:24.165
It's okay, Lydia.

35:24.209 --> 35:25.558
No!

35:25.601 --> 35:27.168
It's not okay!

35:27.212 --> 35:29.039
It's not okay!

35:29.083 --> 35:30.563
It's not okay!

35:30.606 --> 35:32.608
It's not -- not --

35:39.267 --> 35:40.834
It's okay.

35:43.576 --> 35:45.665
It's okay.

35:57.416 --> 35:58.808
Wheels.

35:58.852 --> 36:01.420
Yeah.

36:01.463 --> 36:04.771
Not exactly the kind of ride
I was picturing, but...

36:04.814 --> 36:06.425
15 miles per houris a significant increase

36:06.468 --> 36:08.427
over walking.

36:10.385 --> 36:15.303
To be fair, she wasn't
lying about the garage.

36:18.263 --> 36:20.352
She came through.

36:24.312 --> 36:26.227
Oh, man.

36:28.447 --> 36:31.711
Listen, I --I'm not a bad person.

36:31.754 --> 36:33.365
I want you to know that.

36:33.408 --> 36:37.238
And you had every reason
not to trust me.

36:37.282 --> 36:39.675
It's so hard to take a chance
on people in this world.

36:39.719 --> 36:42.287
And when those people
lie to you, well ---

36:42.330 --> 36:44.114
Yeah. I know.

36:44.158 --> 36:45.681
It sucks.

36:45.725 --> 36:47.422
I blew it.

36:47.466 --> 36:49.424
I know.

36:49.468 --> 36:51.252
And I'm sorry.

36:51.296 --> 36:52.862
I guess...

36:52.906 --> 36:54.255
I wish I had
done things better,

36:54.299 --> 36:57.476
but I guess my people skills
are pretty rusty.

36:57.519 --> 37:00.087
Well, that's something we'regonna have to work on, then.

37:01.523 --> 37:04.483
I was coming over here to seeif you wanted to join us.

37:10.228 --> 37:12.142
Wait. For real?

37:12.186 --> 37:14.710
Yeah, as long as you don'tlie to us again, okay?

37:14.754 --> 37:16.059
Yes.

37:16.103 --> 37:18.888
Yes, yes, yes!

37:18.932 --> 37:20.281
Yes, yes!
Oh, okay.

37:20.325 --> 37:22.152
Well,you know the area, so...

37:23.937 --> 37:26.113
Do we have enough time to grab
stuff from my stash?

37:26.156 --> 37:28.333
I-I-I've got food
and clothes

37:28.376 --> 37:31.161
and a cool spear
and some candy.

37:31.205 --> 37:32.859
Does this mean
I get to have my gun back?

37:32.902 --> 37:34.469
Can I know
where we're going?

37:34.513 --> 37:37.211
Is there a map?
Do I get to hold it?

37:48.570 --> 37:51.356
What is it?

37:51.399 --> 37:54.315
I can't believe
we just left her.

37:54.359 --> 37:56.274
In a ditch.

37:59.625 --> 38:02.758
What if you were lost...

38:02.802 --> 38:05.413
and no one could find you?

38:05.457 --> 38:08.416
Or RJ was.

38:08.460 --> 38:10.505
Or Mom.

38:12.246 --> 38:15.249
You gotta tell mewhere this is coming from.

38:16.990 --> 38:21.211
I just want us to be
back together again.

38:21.255 --> 38:22.561
At home.

38:22.604 --> 38:24.824
That's all.

38:24.867 --> 38:26.695
I radioed your mom

38:26.739 --> 38:29.394
so she knows not to go home,so she's safe.

38:29.437 --> 38:31.352
And that way,
she can find us.

38:31.396 --> 38:32.788
You talked to her?

38:32.832 --> 38:34.616
No.

38:34.660 --> 38:37.358
But I'm gonna
keep trying.

38:41.014 --> 38:42.624
It doesn't matter.

38:46.062 --> 38:48.369
I talked to her
after the fire.

38:48.413 --> 38:50.240
And I'm worried...

38:50.284 --> 38:53.374
maybe she won't
come home.

38:54.636 --> 38:58.423
What'd she say?

38:58.466 --> 39:01.513
She went to go help
some people she met.

39:01.556 --> 39:05.386
Who needed her.

39:05.430 --> 39:06.953
I didn't wanna tell you.

39:06.996 --> 39:08.824
Why's that?

39:12.654 --> 39:15.657
'Cause maybe
you'd leave, too.

39:17.442 --> 39:18.791
I won't.

39:19.879 --> 39:20.923
You promise?

39:22.534 --> 39:23.622
I can't.

39:23.665 --> 39:27.408
Why?
Because I can't
lie to you.

39:27.452 --> 39:30.411
I don't knowwhat's gonna happen.

39:30.455 --> 39:32.413
And there ain't no onethat can tell you that they do.

39:34.633 --> 39:37.287
And there's one thingI know.

39:37.331 --> 39:38.550
There's a whole bunch of peopleback there

39:38.593 --> 39:41.204
that'd do anything
for you.

39:41.248 --> 39:42.902
And one day,
when you're older,

39:42.945 --> 39:46.035
they're gonna need you to doanything for them.

39:46.079 --> 39:48.255
You gota whole lot of family.

39:59.484 --> 40:03.357
Nothing can take the place ofsomeone you love being gone.

40:03.401 --> 40:05.446
But that doesn't meanthat everything that follows

40:05.490 --> 40:07.361
is gonna break your heart.

40:21.070 --> 40:22.637
Hey.

40:22.681 --> 40:24.509
We gotta go, kiddo,
all right?

40:24.552 --> 40:25.597
Come on.

40:28.295 --> 40:29.818
Gabriel?

40:29.862 --> 40:32.299
Gabriel: Daryl...
where are you?

40:32.342 --> 40:33.648
You're breaking up.
I can't hear you.

40:33.692 --> 40:34.606
Come back...

40:34.649 --> 40:36.042
they've...
surrounded the --

40:36.085 --> 40:37.347
Gabriel?

40:37.391 --> 40:39.654
We need...wagon...Gabriel!

40:58.543 --> 41:01.589
Faith.

41:01.633 --> 41:04.113
Faaaaith...

41:04.157 --> 41:06.942
Reward.

41:06.986 --> 41:10.555
All:
Rewaaaaaaaaard...
