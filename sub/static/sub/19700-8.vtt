WEBVTT

00:03.837 --> 00:05.173
(electricity crackling)

00:05.206 --> 00:06.574
ANNOUNCER: Fargo.

00:06.607 --> 00:08.709
All new Wednesdays at 10:00.

00:08.742 --> 00:10.744
On FX.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.981
ANNOUNCER: FX presents

00:14.014 --> 00:16.016
Feud: Bette and Joan.

00:25.226 --> 00:27.195
Pauline. Hi, I'm Adam Freeman.
Ah.

00:27.228 --> 00:29.330
Nice to meet you. If
you want to grab a seat
Very nice to meet you.

00:29.363 --> 00:30.898
in the chair here,
we're ready for you.
Hmm.

00:30.931 --> 00:32.533
Um, thank you again
for doing this.
My pleasure.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.535
We really appreciate it.
Shouldn't be more than...

00:34.568 --> 00:36.270
maybe an hour or
two, if you have it.

00:36.304 --> 00:37.538
Just a little bit.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.006
PAULINE:
Working for Bob,

00:39.039 --> 00:41.442
I'd come to feel like a doormat.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.244
Only, you know,
the kind of doormat

00:43.277 --> 00:45.513
that's holding up
the whole house.

00:45.546 --> 00:48.216
Um, at the time, I was...

00:48.249 --> 00:51.385
I was going with
a very pleasant mortgage broker,

00:51.419 --> 00:54.855
Howard, and I thought,

00:54.888 --> 00:58.792
"What if I follow Howard on his
transfer to Pontiac, Michigan

00:58.826 --> 01:02.796
and try to find
reward in simple domesticity?"

01:02.830 --> 01:05.299
But I read in the free press

01:05.333 --> 01:08.068
about someone in Detroit

01:08.102 --> 01:12.039
filming veterans' testimony
on war crimes,

01:12.072 --> 01:13.974
so I turned up.

01:14.007 --> 01:16.210
Asked if I could help on set.

01:16.244 --> 01:18.246
Not knowing that there would be

01:18.279 --> 01:20.948
so much more opportunity for me
in documentary

01:20.981 --> 01:22.583
than in Hollywood feature films.

01:22.616 --> 01:25.453
How did you come to reconnect
with Joan Crawford?

01:25.486 --> 01:29.723
I ran into her at LaGuardia.

01:29.757 --> 01:34.128
Um, she was wearing
a Pepto pink dress

01:34.162 --> 01:37.898
and a mask
of chalk-white foundation,

01:37.931 --> 01:39.400
being wheeled
through the airport

01:39.433 --> 01:42.002
with broken ankles, drunk.

01:42.035 --> 01:45.506
Alone.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.841
And for all
our past difficulties,

01:47.875 --> 01:52.112
when I touched her arm,
she cried.

01:52.146 --> 01:54.081
She called me "old friend"

01:54.114 --> 01:57.851
and asked me to visit her
in Manhattan.

01:57.885 --> 02:02.290
She seemed
very much tossed away.

02:04.525 --> 02:06.494
*

02:06.527 --> 02:11.599
* Raindrops keep fallin'
on my head *

02:11.632 --> 02:15.002
* And just like the guy whose
feet are too big for his bed *

02:15.035 --> 02:18.272
* Nothing seems to fit... *
No, Roz.

02:18.306 --> 02:19.807
Easy Rider.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.509
You know,
the one where the actor

02:21.542 --> 02:25.313
is dressed all in fringe
like an Indian chief.

02:25.346 --> 02:28.949
And that Jack Nicholson,
is he vaguely cross-eyed?

02:28.982 --> 02:29.950
(microwave dings)

02:29.983 --> 02:32.286
* And I said *

02:32.320 --> 02:36.390
* I didn't like
the way he got things done *
Oh! Aah!

02:36.424 --> 02:38.659
* Sleeping on the job... *

02:38.692 --> 02:41.729
MAN: We got the same
harried situation

02:41.762 --> 02:45.065
when we dropped in
to pick up wounded soldiers.

02:45.098 --> 02:47.201
It's typical of the Viet...

02:47.235 --> 02:49.837
MAN 2: When the attention
of the hijackers was diverted,

02:49.870 --> 02:53.140
the two hostages slipped
from the rear door...

02:53.173 --> 02:54.308
MAN 3:
Don't you like dancing?

02:54.342 --> 02:55.843
WOMAN:
No, not with strangers.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.711
MAN 3: Never?
WOMAN: Never.

02:57.745 --> 02:59.813
MAN 3:
Thanks very much.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.415
WOMAN:
Not at all.

03:01.449 --> 03:02.916
* Till happiness *

03:02.950 --> 03:06.587
* Steps up to greet me *

03:10.391 --> 03:14.695
* Raindrops keep fallin'
on my head *
(sighs)

03:14.728 --> 03:16.664
* But that doesn't mean
my eyes *

03:16.697 --> 03:20.167
* Will soon be turning red *

03:20.200 --> 03:23.704
* Crying's not for me,
'cause *

03:23.737 --> 03:27.375
* I'm never gonna stop
the rain by complaining... *

03:27.408 --> 03:31.111
Carl, it's Joan Crawford.

03:31.144 --> 03:33.347
I'm so terribly sorry,

03:33.381 --> 03:36.550
but I'm not going to be able
to meet you for lunch today.

03:36.584 --> 03:38.386
No.

03:38.419 --> 03:41.121
Please excuse me. Thank you.

03:41.154 --> 03:42.856
* The blues they send
to meet me *

03:42.890 --> 03:44.425
* Won't defeat me *

03:46.727 --> 03:49.897
* It won't be long
till happiness *

03:49.930 --> 03:53.734
* Steps up to greet me... *

03:55.969 --> 03:59.307
(chuckles)

03:59.340 --> 04:00.874
Look!

04:00.908 --> 04:02.576
Here's your new home.

04:02.610 --> 04:05.813
Yes.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.481
Yes.

04:07.515 --> 04:10.484
* It won't be long *

04:10.518 --> 04:14.154
* Till happiness steps up *

04:14.187 --> 04:17.425
* To greet me *

04:17.458 --> 04:19.660
(puppy whines, doorbell buzzes)

04:19.693 --> 04:22.663
* Raindrops keep fallin'
on my head... *

04:22.696 --> 04:24.832
I will make myself
available to you

04:24.865 --> 04:26.734
on a part-time basis.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.803
* Will soon be turning red *

04:29.837 --> 04:32.272
* Crying's not for me... *

04:32.306 --> 04:35.943
Princess Lotus Blossom,

04:35.976 --> 04:37.845
this is Mamacita.

04:37.878 --> 04:41.749
(chuckles)
* Because I'm free *

04:41.782 --> 04:47.020
* Nothing's worrying me. *

04:51.959 --> 04:54.695
*

05:25.926 --> 05:28.929
*

05:55.088 --> 05:57.858
(seagulls chirping,
waves crashing)

06:16.544 --> 06:20.080
I, uh, told my mother
the great Joan Crawford...
Ah.

06:20.113 --> 06:21.549
...was on the books today.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.016
She made me promise to ask

06:23.050 --> 06:24.384
when you'll reteam
with Bette Davis.

06:24.418 --> 06:26.353
(chuckles)

06:26.386 --> 06:28.856
It hurts.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.191
Yeah. The infections
are pretty severe.

06:31.224 --> 06:34.194
And by my count, you're
missing six molars?

06:34.227 --> 06:35.763
Extractions.

06:35.796 --> 06:37.465
What kind of medieval
dental practice

06:37.498 --> 06:40.133
extracts six teeth without
putting in implants?

06:40.167 --> 06:42.470
I did it when I was 23.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.638
It's called "the buckle."

06:44.672 --> 06:46.406
When you remove the back teeth,

06:46.440 --> 06:50.277
your cheeks curve in
at a more elegant angle.

06:50.310 --> 06:54.214
Why the heck
would you do that?

06:54.247 --> 06:58.251
My agent told me
if I wanted to work past 25,

06:58.285 --> 07:01.989
I should invest
in a set of cheekbones.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.958
You can't catch their eye
if you can't catch the light,

07:04.992 --> 07:07.461
so I did the buckle.
It was not uncommon.

07:07.495 --> 07:11.264
It's also led to bone loss.

07:11.298 --> 07:13.333
There's barely anything holding
your remaining teeth in place.

07:13.366 --> 07:14.768
(chuckles)

07:14.802 --> 07:16.403
Well, you know what they say
about stars.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.639
They're like Christmas trees.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.140
Once the lights are off,

07:20.173 --> 07:22.543
you sit there
and watch the needles drop.

07:25.513 --> 07:27.848
I'm gonna recommend
you to a periodontist

07:27.881 --> 07:29.249
to operate on the infections

07:29.282 --> 07:31.151
and get you on Darvocet
for the pain,

07:31.184 --> 07:33.587
but your problems are
gonna get a lot worse

07:33.621 --> 07:35.455
unless we take care of
the other offenders:

07:35.489 --> 07:38.325
the old caps, the teeth
pushing into open spaces.
Mm-hmm.

07:38.358 --> 07:41.428
I want to fit you
for an overdenture.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.096
(chuckles)

07:43.130 --> 07:44.865
A denture.
Mmm.

07:44.898 --> 07:46.366
No.

07:46.399 --> 07:48.802
I'll do the surgery
if I have to,

07:48.836 --> 07:50.971
but no dentures.

07:51.004 --> 07:53.040
I'd rather spit blood
into a sink

07:53.073 --> 07:56.343
than look like Martha Raye.

07:56.376 --> 07:58.779
Miss Crawford,
at your age,

07:58.812 --> 08:01.014
you need to worry more
about staying healthy

08:01.048 --> 08:04.685
than staying photogenic.

08:04.718 --> 08:08.221
I'll stop worrying
about how I look

08:08.255 --> 08:11.191
when they dip me
in formaldehyde.

08:11.224 --> 08:13.527
MAMACITA:
Miss Joan,

08:13.561 --> 08:16.063
time to wake up.
(puppy yips)

08:16.096 --> 08:19.399
Up, up, up.

08:19.432 --> 08:20.834
Your agent called.

08:20.868 --> 08:23.671
He wants to meet with you
this evening.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.205
Stan?

08:25.238 --> 08:28.676
I... I haven't talked
to him in months.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.410
The Missing Link?

08:30.443 --> 08:32.746
It's a B movie. I told them
you wouldn't be interested.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.682
Well, who would I play?

08:34.715 --> 08:37.184
You'd play an anthropologist

08:37.217 --> 08:39.553
who has discovered a caveman

08:39.587 --> 08:42.189
who has been preserved
for millennia in ice.

08:42.222 --> 08:44.191
A scientist?

08:44.224 --> 08:47.561
(chuckles)

08:47.595 --> 08:51.565
Oh, I had dreamed
of playing Madame Curie.

08:51.599 --> 08:53.533
When I was at MGM,

08:53.567 --> 08:57.571
I begged Louie to cast me
in that picture, but...

08:57.605 --> 08:58.939
Well, this is hardly that, Joan.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.207
It's not MGM.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.842
It's more like
a Hammer Horror picture.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.612
I'd advise against it.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.013
I'll do it.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.047
Joan.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.782
Look, Stan...

09:08.816 --> 09:11.118
I need to work.

09:11.151 --> 09:12.586
And if I deliver

09:12.620 --> 09:14.021
a fine performance

09:14.054 --> 09:16.857
in an independent picture...

09:16.890 --> 09:21.128
I mean, you know
how the Academy loves to reward

09:21.161 --> 09:23.530
that kind of star turn.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.099
They're not paying much.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.901
I'll accept a reduced salary,

09:27.935 --> 09:31.138
but will they cover the
travel expenses for my maid?

09:31.171 --> 09:32.472
I'm afraid not.

09:32.505 --> 09:33.774
Hmm.

09:35.943 --> 09:39.546
Well, it'll be an adventure.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.282
Well, let's talk about
the other very generous offer

09:42.315 --> 09:43.550
from Simon & Schuster.

09:43.583 --> 09:47.454
Lifestyle advice
book for women.

09:47.487 --> 09:49.723
How does Joan Crawford
keep her house?

09:49.757 --> 09:51.792
How does she
throw a dinner party?

09:51.825 --> 09:53.994
How does she maintain
those famous legs?

09:54.027 --> 09:56.596
(chuckles)
Is there still a market

09:56.630 --> 09:58.131
for something like that?

09:58.165 --> 09:59.733
Of course there is, Joan.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.334
You're an icon.

10:01.368 --> 10:04.004
We'll get you a state of
the art tape recorder.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.605
You can get your thoughts down.

10:05.639 --> 10:07.607
We'll hire someone
to type it up.

10:07.641 --> 10:10.277
And if the book is
a hit, potentially,

10:10.310 --> 10:12.780
it's a huge branding
opportunity.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.982
Joan Crawford luggage,

10:15.015 --> 10:17.184
Joan Crawford dinnerware,

10:17.217 --> 10:20.253
Joan Crawford
plastic furniture covers.

10:20.287 --> 10:24.591
I would love that.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.794
(horn honks)

10:41.508 --> 10:44.577
Oh, sorry.

10:53.553 --> 10:56.123
Joan Crawford.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.858
4,000 miles from home,

10:57.891 --> 11:00.127
and you look like you
stepped off the pages

11:00.160 --> 11:01.962
of McCall's.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.364
Freddie Francis, your director.

11:04.397 --> 11:06.633
Oh. (chuckles)

11:06.666 --> 11:08.201
I don't look a mess?

11:08.235 --> 11:10.971
You know, the car never arrived

11:11.004 --> 11:12.372
to take me to the hotel,

11:12.405 --> 11:13.874
so I had to hire a cab

11:13.907 --> 11:16.009
to bring me straight here
from the airport.

11:16.043 --> 11:18.411
My apologies. We're still
getting our little production

11:18.445 --> 11:19.579
up on its feet.

11:19.612 --> 11:20.848
But rest assured,

11:20.881 --> 11:23.884
Trog is going to be
a first-rate production.

11:23.917 --> 11:26.586
Trog? What is Trog?

11:26.619 --> 11:28.355
Oh, as in troglodyte.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.590
Trog-- it's the title
of the movie.

11:30.623 --> 11:33.894
I thought the picture
was entitled The Missing Link.

11:33.927 --> 11:37.197
We changed it to pop out
on the posters.

11:37.230 --> 11:40.901
Picture it: Trog. (chuckles)

11:45.906 --> 11:48.441
And what is that?

11:48.475 --> 11:50.210
Oh, uh, your co-star.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.179
Trog.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.281
But he has no hair on his arms

11:54.314 --> 11:56.083
or his legs.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.051
Well, you two will be sharing
a makeup table,

11:58.085 --> 12:01.789
so perhaps you can help
refine his look.

12:01.822 --> 12:04.958
You mean I don't have
a private dressing room?

12:04.992 --> 12:08.929
Well, our budget doesn't really
allow for such luxuries.

12:08.962 --> 12:11.031
And when we're out on location,

12:11.064 --> 12:14.201
am I expected to change
behind a bush?

12:14.234 --> 12:16.436
Oh, certainly not.
We've got you a vehicle.

12:16.469 --> 12:17.838
What kind of vehicle?

12:22.275 --> 12:24.677
We can put in
some curtains.

12:30.150 --> 12:32.585
(hammering, distant chatter)

12:38.926 --> 12:42.996
(laughs)

12:46.699 --> 12:48.635
Whoa.
(table squeaks)

13:01.348 --> 13:05.018
This is Joan Crawford.

13:05.052 --> 13:08.488
Let's begin
with my point of view.

13:08.521 --> 13:12.359
I always say, treasure yourself.

13:12.392 --> 13:15.963
I do a certain amount
of self-pampering.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.497
* This is the end... *

13:17.530 --> 13:19.666
I surround myself
with happy colors.

13:19.699 --> 13:23.236
Have you worked
with Freddie Francis before?

13:25.472 --> 13:28.842
* This is the end,
my only friend... *

13:28.876 --> 13:32.045
I sit on hard chairs.

13:32.079 --> 13:35.148
Soft ones spread the hips.

13:35.182 --> 13:38.218
People ask me if I turn up
at board meetings

13:38.251 --> 13:40.620
wearing tailored costumes
and muted colors.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.023
Oh, no.

13:43.056 --> 13:45.458
I wear shocking pink
and lovely hats.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.660
No man ever did a poor job

13:47.694 --> 13:50.830
because he had
an attractive woman to look at.

13:50.864 --> 13:53.333
* I'll never look... *

13:53.366 --> 13:56.169
Every woman tries to be a
good mother, and then wonders,

13:56.203 --> 13:58.138
if after all her efforts,

13:58.171 --> 14:00.540
her children will wind up
on a head shrinker's couch

14:00.573 --> 14:01.909
complaining about
their bad treatment.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.476
FREDDY:
Joan?

14:03.510 --> 14:06.880
* Can you picture
what will be *

14:06.914 --> 14:11.851
(whirring)
* So limitless and free *

14:11.885 --> 14:14.387
(Trog groans)
* Desperately... *

14:14.421 --> 14:18.758
I mistrust people
who don't like animals.

14:18.791 --> 14:21.861
That's fine, Trog.

14:21.895 --> 14:23.863
He understands.

14:23.897 --> 14:25.899
(groans)

14:25.933 --> 14:28.368
The prime objective
of our program is

14:28.401 --> 14:30.403
to gradually pull Trog

14:30.437 --> 14:34.841
across a time span right into
the heart of the 20th century.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.543
Seems like an
impulsive...

14:36.576 --> 14:38.045
I'm so sorry.
Excuse me.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.746
Is there

14:39.779 --> 14:43.050
any way to say this
with fewer words?

14:43.083 --> 14:45.118
And action.

14:45.152 --> 14:49.122
If he's as old as you say he is,
how did he survive?

14:49.156 --> 14:52.892
Uh, conceivably, Trog, uh,
was frozen solid

14:52.926 --> 14:56.796
during the long, long...
glacial age.

14:56.829 --> 15:01.534
Uh, a-a state similar
to... chyro... I'm sorry.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.037
Let me start that.
A state similar to

15:04.071 --> 15:06.974
chyro... uh, suspen...

15:07.007 --> 15:09.209
I'm sorry, could you give me
the line, please?

15:09.242 --> 15:11.644
Can we get the
cue cards for Joan?

15:11.678 --> 15:14.314
Oh, I... I... All right.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.483
JOAN:
There are no hard
and fast rules

15:16.516 --> 15:18.885
for fending off
an outright pass,

15:18.918 --> 15:21.288
especially if it comes
from the boss.

15:21.321 --> 15:25.258
Every intelligent woman has her
own method of turning it down

15:25.292 --> 15:28.761
without wounding
a sensitive male ego.

15:30.197 --> 15:32.432
Join us for a pint.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.101
Oh.

15:34.134 --> 15:36.469
Thank you very much,
but I simply can't. (laughs)

15:36.503 --> 15:38.905
An even cleverer woman
knows how

15:38.938 --> 15:41.641
to prevent the pass
in the first place.

15:41.674 --> 15:44.477
If you can't control
your cleavage, your perfume,

15:44.511 --> 15:46.279
your walk and your eyelashes,

15:46.313 --> 15:49.349
you'd better stay out
of the business.

15:49.382 --> 15:54.321
Here are a few items no dieter
should ever have in the house:

15:54.354 --> 15:57.790
peas, lima beans,
avocadoes, olives,

15:57.824 --> 16:01.528
dried beans, corn,
butter, most cheese.

16:01.561 --> 16:06.533
Creamed chicken with mash
potatoes makes too much mush.

16:06.566 --> 16:10.270
Always serve something crisp
with something soft.

16:10.303 --> 16:13.173
FREDDY:
It's just beginning to ring
a bell in your head, yes.

16:13.206 --> 16:15.175
Now it's becoming clear,
clearer.
(Trog groaning)

16:15.208 --> 16:17.210
You're remembering the attack
on your village.

16:17.244 --> 16:19.712
Yes, yes.
JOAN: All the beauty products
in the world

16:19.746 --> 16:22.382
can't disguise
a disagreeable expression.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.351
Have you ever noticed
that when you say,

16:24.384 --> 16:28.688
"no," you resemble
a prune-faced schoolmarm?

16:28.721 --> 16:30.023
Well, let's shoot it.

16:30.057 --> 16:33.460
Remind you of your youth
at MGM, Joan?

16:33.493 --> 16:37.697
* Seven miles... *

16:37.730 --> 16:41.034
JOAN:
I feel as if
clothes are people.

16:41.068 --> 16:43.670
When I buy a dress,
that's a new friend.

16:43.703 --> 16:46.806
I have a tremendous respect
for fabrics.

16:46.839 --> 16:51.010
(sighs)
* And his skin is cold... *

16:51.044 --> 16:53.146
She's been spending
her nights here.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.815
Says she's practicing
her blocking.

16:55.848 --> 17:00.687
But tonight, she just
seems a wee bitty lost.

17:00.720 --> 17:05.325
...is a living reminder
of our ancestors who...

17:05.358 --> 17:07.560
JOAN:
I don't know this.
Leave her alone.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.062
JOAN:
The apes

17:09.096 --> 17:11.364
who left the forest and...

17:13.766 --> 17:16.103
JOAN:
I love people.

17:16.136 --> 17:20.107
I've been asked if I ever
go around in disguise. Never!

17:20.140 --> 17:23.076
I want to be recognized.

17:23.110 --> 17:26.579
When I hear people say,
"There's Joan Crawford,"

17:26.613 --> 17:30.583
I turn around and say,
"Hi. How are you?"

17:30.617 --> 17:34.087
* Of some stranger's hand *

17:36.623 --> 17:41.027
* The end of laughter *

17:41.060 --> 17:44.131
* And soft lies *

17:46.233 --> 17:50.137
* The end of nights *

17:50.170 --> 17:55.808
* We tried to die *

18:06.018 --> 18:12.992
* This is the end. *

18:13.025 --> 18:15.395
(door bells jingle)

18:15.428 --> 18:17.230
Make it to Brenda.

18:17.264 --> 18:18.965
Yes.

18:18.998 --> 18:22.169
Wow. You're even more
glamorous in real life.

18:22.202 --> 18:24.937
(laughs)
Thank you, Brenda.

18:24.971 --> 18:27.174
I hope you enjoy
reading my beauty secrets

18:27.207 --> 18:28.675
I've picked up over the years.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.143
Oh.

18:30.177 --> 18:31.911
Is there stuff
about Trog in there?

18:31.944 --> 18:34.080
I've seen it six times.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.482
"Trog, stop it."

18:35.515 --> 18:37.250
(laughing):
What a riot.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.852
Brenda, there's a long line
of readers wondering

18:39.886 --> 18:43.956
what makes you so special
as to monopolize all my time.

18:43.990 --> 18:45.558
(quiet laughter)

18:47.527 --> 18:49.296
(camera shutter clicking)

18:49.329 --> 18:53.633
These people aren't here
to buy the book for my advice.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.802
They're here
to buy it to mock me.

18:55.835 --> 18:58.004
Well, you should be
grateful for the turnout.

18:58.037 --> 19:00.139
They've hardly been
buying it at all.

19:00.173 --> 19:02.041
MAN:
If you don't
mind, I have

19:02.074 --> 19:03.476
two items for you to sign.

19:03.510 --> 19:07.046
Baby Jane.

19:07.079 --> 19:09.849
Why don't you have a picture

19:09.882 --> 19:12.885
from Grand Hotel,
or Mildred Pierce, or

19:12.919 --> 19:16.155
any of the 30 years
of pictures I made

19:16.189 --> 19:18.157
before Baby fucking Jane?

19:18.191 --> 19:20.560
I like all your movies,
Miss Crawford,

19:20.593 --> 19:24.030
but this one is special to me.

19:24.063 --> 19:25.965
Why? Because you think
it's funny?

19:25.998 --> 19:28.968
No. I mean, yeah, it's funny.

19:29.001 --> 19:34.507
But I love it because Blanche
and Baby Jane are cast aside,

19:34.541 --> 19:36.743
beaten down
and forgotten,

19:36.776 --> 19:39.546
but they never give up hope
that they'll rise again.

19:39.579 --> 19:42.249
They're survivors.

19:48.221 --> 19:50.690
What do you know about survival?

19:52.859 --> 19:56.863
(crowd murmuring)

19:56.896 --> 19:59.899
(horn honks)

20:08.107 --> 20:11.344
Why are they running
these pictures of us?

20:11.378 --> 20:12.579
They're awful.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.180
It is not so bad.

20:14.213 --> 20:17.116
It's monstrous. That's why
they're running them.

20:17.149 --> 20:19.552
Poor Roz--
she's fighting leukemia,

20:19.586 --> 20:21.521
no wonder her face is
as big as a moon,

20:21.554 --> 20:26.025
but there must have been
better pictures of me.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.795
You were tired
and emotional.

20:31.331 --> 20:34.467
Is that really how I look?

20:37.804 --> 20:41.040
(sighs)

20:41.073 --> 20:44.477
Well, if that's how they see me,
they'll never see me again.

20:44.511 --> 20:46.913
Stan,

20:46.946 --> 20:51.618
I want you to stop
submitting me for roles.

20:51.651 --> 20:53.753
I'm done.

20:55.522 --> 20:57.924
PAULINE:
You know, in Japan,

20:57.957 --> 21:01.761
when you turn 60,
you put on this bright red hat,

21:01.794 --> 21:03.763
and you celebrate kanreki.

21:03.796 --> 21:06.265
It's your second childhood.

21:06.299 --> 21:09.168
Life isn't over.
It's just beginning.

21:11.804 --> 21:14.474
Can I ask you something?
Is your grandmother still alive?

21:14.507 --> 21:16.609
ADAM:
Yes.

21:16.643 --> 21:19.045
Give her a call.

21:33.526 --> 21:35.362
Oh, looks comfortable.
Isn't comfortable.

21:35.395 --> 21:39.298
So, Victor, after all the drama
involved in its production,

21:39.332 --> 21:41.033
how do you think
Charlotte turned out?

21:41.067 --> 21:42.802
Have you interviewed Bette yet?

21:42.835 --> 21:44.804
She's rescheduled on us
a number of times.

21:44.837 --> 21:46.305
Well, there'll be hell to pay

21:46.339 --> 21:48.341
if she finds herself
unfairly maligned,

21:48.375 --> 21:52.545
but at the risk of taking
my lashes, I'll tell you.

21:52.579 --> 21:55.314
I think Charlotte was just okay.

21:55.348 --> 21:57.384
It didn't have the magic
of Baby Jane,

21:57.417 --> 21:58.818
and the New York Times

21:58.851 --> 22:02.154
called Bette's performance
"resentable."

22:02.188 --> 22:03.990
Hmm. Was she upset?
Oh.

22:04.023 --> 22:06.325
Failure made her desperate.

22:06.359 --> 22:08.828
She was sure that every job
she got would be her last.

22:08.861 --> 22:12.031
She snatched up every offer
that came her way,

22:12.064 --> 22:13.366
and she lost
that special something

22:13.400 --> 22:15.067
that I considered her signature.

22:15.101 --> 22:17.737
What was that?

22:17.770 --> 22:19.506
Her high standards.

22:19.539 --> 22:21.173
Do you think
my type is coming back?

22:21.207 --> 22:22.241
(audience laughs)

22:22.274 --> 22:24.243
So it's top secret.

22:24.276 --> 22:28.381
If any man in Washington can
declassify it for me, you can.

22:28.415 --> 22:29.849
VICTOR:
Eight

22:29.882 --> 22:31.350
pilots she made.

22:31.384 --> 22:33.553
It was like
Miles Davis playing jingles

22:33.586 --> 22:35.021
for lunch meat commercials.

22:35.054 --> 22:36.889
And I've told her this
to her face.

22:36.923 --> 22:39.358
We're friends
because I tell the truth.

22:39.392 --> 22:43.362
But... what devastated her,
in fact,

22:43.396 --> 22:46.433
was that the force of her talent
wasn't even enough

22:46.466 --> 22:49.101
to get one of the eight
bought for series.

22:49.135 --> 22:50.737
BETTE:
What idiots

22:50.770 --> 22:53.039
are these businessmen
that they pay for a pilot

22:53.072 --> 22:55.508
and then they don't bother
to put it on the air.

22:55.542 --> 22:57.444
They must make measure

22:57.477 --> 23:00.046
of whether the shows
will be losers over time.

23:00.079 --> 23:02.782
Plenty of losers get bought.
Why not mine?

23:02.815 --> 23:05.618
Is that really what
you want, my dear?

23:05.652 --> 23:08.888
To spend your years in Burbank,
playing a hypochondriac judge?

23:08.921 --> 23:11.190
Oh, I don't know
how this happened.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.860
Hepburn is off doing Albee
and Tennessee Williams

23:13.893 --> 23:15.962
and being nominated
for Academy Awards.

23:15.995 --> 23:17.730
Am I not

23:17.764 --> 23:19.231
every bit her equal?

23:19.265 --> 23:21.434
Am I not every bit
as interesting as she is?

23:21.468 --> 23:22.869
How does she manage?

23:22.902 --> 23:25.538
But Katharine sometimes says no.

23:25.572 --> 23:28.107
Well, she doesn't have
to support children, does she?

23:28.140 --> 23:29.909
And she's a snob.

23:29.942 --> 23:31.878
Did you know that

23:31.911 --> 23:33.412
Life magazine wanted

23:33.446 --> 23:34.981
to photograph
the two of us together?

23:35.014 --> 23:36.415
The two legends.

23:36.449 --> 23:38.417
I bought a flight
to New York,

23:38.451 --> 23:40.553
and she ignored their calls.

23:40.587 --> 23:42.622
Life magazine!

23:42.655 --> 23:46.292
And when
she finally answered them...

23:46.325 --> 23:48.961
she said she didn't want
to pose with me.

23:48.995 --> 23:52.499
Nothing good can come
from comparing yourself.

23:57.303 --> 24:01.240
If Katharine were sitting
right there...

24:01.273 --> 24:04.777
you know what
I'd say to her?

24:06.012 --> 24:09.582
I would say...

24:09.616 --> 24:12.318
"I pity you.

24:12.351 --> 24:17.524
"I have had an experience
that you will never have.

24:17.557 --> 24:20.259
"And thank God I had it,

24:20.292 --> 24:25.498
because... I have the love
of my children."

24:28.501 --> 24:30.503
(Bette coughing)

24:33.906 --> 24:36.609
Oh. What, no kiss for Mother?

24:36.643 --> 24:38.144
Not with a cough like that.

24:38.177 --> 24:41.147
(coughing)

24:41.180 --> 24:43.482
Oh, Christ.

24:43.516 --> 24:47.486
Old Hollywood is really over.

24:47.520 --> 24:50.723
Look at this place.
It's really gone down.

24:50.757 --> 24:54.527
Just hope the food
is still good.

24:56.529 --> 25:00.466
I was so looking forward
to a real girls' lunch.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.735
Let's make a day of it, hon.
Seems as if they don't

25:02.769 --> 25:04.537
have barbershops
in Pennsylvania.

25:04.571 --> 25:06.706
Why don't I take you
to my salon?

25:06.739 --> 25:08.741
Jeremy likes my hair this way.
Well,

25:08.775 --> 25:12.311
of course. It's in keeping
with his caveman sensibility.

25:12.344 --> 25:13.846
(laughing)

25:13.880 --> 25:16.883
I'm kidding, darling.

25:16.916 --> 25:19.652
Well, Jeremy's old-school ways
seem to suit you.

25:19.686 --> 25:21.087
Everyone thought
you'd be divorced by 18,

25:21.120 --> 25:22.755
and look at you--
you're still in love.

25:22.789 --> 25:24.356
It's marvelous.

25:24.390 --> 25:27.259
Why don't we ask him

25:27.293 --> 25:29.095
to join us this afternoon?

25:29.128 --> 25:31.698
And we could take the children
to the observatory.

25:31.731 --> 25:34.333
Jeremy went back
to Pennsylvania.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.068
With the boys.

25:36.102 --> 25:38.671
What? But they were meant
to spend the rest of the week

25:38.705 --> 25:41.207
with me. I... I booked
an acting coach for Ashley

25:41.240 --> 25:43.109
to help him with his diction,

25:43.142 --> 25:45.544
and we've had plans
for the zoo. You...
My children

25:45.578 --> 25:48.014
aren't staying with you
ever again, Mother.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.949
Ashley told us

25:49.982 --> 25:52.585
you beat on his baby brother
last night.

25:52.619 --> 25:54.754
(gasps)
Well, I did no such thing.

25:54.787 --> 25:56.856
Wh... Why would he say that?

25:56.889 --> 25:58.557
You didn't beat
Justin for crying

25:58.591 --> 26:00.226
when Jeremy and I
left for the hotel?

26:00.259 --> 26:02.128
Oh, I swatted him.

26:02.161 --> 26:05.131
He was throwing a temper
tantrum, he was out of control.

26:05.164 --> 26:07.199
You traumatized him.
B.D.,

26:07.233 --> 26:10.236
I swatted you a thousand times--
did I traumatize you?

26:19.111 --> 26:22.214
From now on, if you want to
visit with your grandchildren,

26:22.248 --> 26:26.152
you may do so at our farm,
under supervision.

26:26.185 --> 26:30.056
After you do something
about your drinking problem.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.291
Since when do you...

26:32.324 --> 26:34.827
since when do you
think I'm a drunk?

26:36.796 --> 26:40.767
You're sitting right there
with a margarita at 11:00 a.m.

26:48.507 --> 26:51.310
Let's order some guacamole.

26:51.343 --> 26:53.579
Everything seems dire
on an empty stomach.

26:53.612 --> 26:56.015
I'm not eating with you.

26:56.048 --> 26:58.117
I came here

26:58.150 --> 27:00.152
to say what I had to say.

27:08.027 --> 27:10.362
(Bette coughing)
DOCTOR:
I want to run some blood work.

27:10.396 --> 27:14.333
No, ma'am, I just
need something to...

27:14.366 --> 27:16.202
(coughing):
soothe my cough.

27:16.235 --> 27:18.504
We'll both be happier
preventing your problems

27:18.537 --> 27:20.639
than trying to solve them
once they dig in.

27:20.673 --> 27:22.141
You're not 18.

27:22.174 --> 27:24.677
Oh, thanks. News flash.

27:24.711 --> 27:26.112
(coughs)

27:26.145 --> 27:29.648
Can I persuade you
to lay off the smoking?

27:29.682 --> 27:32.551
(chuckles)
Look, I'm off booze.

27:32.584 --> 27:35.654
I can't give up cigarettes.
They're my only friends.

27:35.688 --> 27:37.389
How long ago
did you stop drinking?

27:37.423 --> 27:39.225
17 days.
You shouldn't

27:39.258 --> 27:41.227
white-knuckle detox, Bette.

27:41.260 --> 27:45.164
So you need help with your
drinking problem. Big whoop.

27:45.197 --> 27:47.900
A lot of women your age
turn to alcohol when they have

27:47.934 --> 27:50.302
little else to do.
(groans)

27:50.336 --> 27:52.805
I'll grab you some brochures
on rehab facilities.

27:52.839 --> 27:55.341
Oh, no. I'm... I
can't go to rehab.

27:55.374 --> 27:58.344
I can't, I've got
the Dean Martin roast.

27:58.377 --> 28:00.346
(coughing)

28:00.379 --> 28:01.580
VICTOR:
Oh...

28:01.613 --> 28:03.182
the roast.

28:03.215 --> 28:05.651
It was the cruelest
of degradations.

28:05.684 --> 28:08.154
Demeaned and insulted
by fifth-rate celebrities.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.521
(applause)
DEAN MARTIN: And here's one

28:09.555 --> 28:12.825
from Harold Donaldson
from Detroit.

28:12.859 --> 28:15.728
"Dear Miss Davis,
my wife and I just saw your film

28:15.762 --> 28:17.496
"What Ever Happened
to Baby Jane?

28:17.529 --> 28:19.832
"Could you settle
an argument for us?

28:19.866 --> 28:23.669
In private life, are you and
Joan Crawford really brothers?"

28:23.702 --> 28:25.571
(audience laughing)

28:25.604 --> 28:28.174
JOYCE HABER: Bette was
the queen of Hollywood.

28:28.207 --> 28:31.343
Back in the days
where queens were still ladies.

28:31.377 --> 28:34.080
And Joan Crawford was king.

28:34.113 --> 28:36.182
(audience guffaws, applauds)

28:36.215 --> 28:38.918
VINCENT PRICE: Miss Crawford
has always been envious

28:38.951 --> 28:41.253
of Bette's voluptuous figure.

28:41.287 --> 28:42.855
As a matter of fact,

28:42.889 --> 28:45.457
Joan used to borrow Bette's bras

28:45.491 --> 28:47.960
to use them as shoulder pads.

28:47.994 --> 28:49.862
(laughing, applause)

28:49.896 --> 28:52.865
ADAM: Did she tell Joan how bad
she felt about the roast?

28:52.899 --> 28:56.568
No. And I think
she regretted it.

28:56.602 --> 28:59.738
Especially after Aimee.
Aimee?

28:59.772 --> 29:02.909
Aimee Semple McPherson,
the famed evangelist.

29:02.942 --> 29:04.410
BETTE:
I met her.

29:04.443 --> 29:06.278
You did?
1932

29:06.312 --> 29:09.415
at the Foursquare Gospel Church.

29:09.448 --> 29:11.483
What a performer.

29:11.517 --> 29:13.820
A fraudulent
evangelical minister

29:13.853 --> 29:17.323
who faked her own kidnapping.
Can you imagine?

29:17.356 --> 29:19.458
Well, I begged the studio
to let me play her.

29:19.491 --> 29:22.995
Not a single bite.

29:23.029 --> 29:26.132
In '76 Bette landed a role
playing not the minister

29:26.165 --> 29:28.767
but the mother
in The Disappearance of Aimee.

29:28.801 --> 29:30.769
Right,
the Faye Dunaway movie.

29:30.803 --> 29:33.339
Ooh. If you ever do end up
interviewing Bette,

29:33.372 --> 29:36.075
I'd advise against
calling it that.

29:36.108 --> 29:39.078
For all her complaints
about Joan,

29:39.111 --> 29:42.949
she didn't know true hatred
until she met Faye.

29:45.117 --> 29:46.819
Hanging in there, Miss Davis?

29:46.853 --> 29:49.822
If I hang in here any longer,
I'll fall off my branch.

29:49.856 --> 29:52.491
You know, locations
used to come to me.

29:52.524 --> 29:54.793
Here, Anthony, I want
to read you this.

29:54.827 --> 29:57.129
A passage.

29:57.163 --> 30:00.499
"And Moses sayeth
to his brethren,

30:00.532 --> 30:03.469
"'The Lord shall afflict you
with lesions

30:03.502 --> 30:06.338
"'all over your body
if you be not punctual

30:06.372 --> 30:08.975
"'in your laborings,

30:09.008 --> 30:10.709
"'even if you are very pretty

30:10.742 --> 30:13.212
and the star of Chinatown.'"

30:13.245 --> 30:14.680
(chuckles)

30:14.713 --> 30:15.982
Is that from Romans?

30:16.015 --> 30:17.683
Our call was 6:00 a.m.

30:17.716 --> 30:20.686
I arrived at 5:45.
I did not see Miss Faye Dunaway

30:20.719 --> 30:22.454
in her makeup chair until 7:00.

30:22.488 --> 30:25.892
It is now 11:00, and while
we all roast to death

30:25.925 --> 30:27.626
in this toaster oven,

30:27.659 --> 30:29.561
you, sir, have still

30:29.595 --> 30:32.698
not gotten off
your first goddamn shot.

30:33.900 --> 30:36.068
I could have kicked that part

30:36.102 --> 30:38.070
right out of the park.

30:38.104 --> 30:40.672
Well, you're an intimidating
presence, Bette.

30:40.706 --> 30:43.209
Put yourself inside
Faye Dunaway's shoes.

30:43.242 --> 30:46.578
I just think maybe she didn't
come out of her trailer

30:46.612 --> 30:49.015
because she was afraid
she couldn't keep up with you.

30:49.048 --> 30:52.919
There is no excuse
for unprofessionalism.

30:52.952 --> 30:54.921
(grunts)

30:54.954 --> 30:57.423
Hell, it almost
makes you miss Crawford.

30:57.456 --> 31:00.559
At least she had the
decency to show up on time

31:00.592 --> 31:02.428
and she was
the first one on the set

31:02.461 --> 31:04.196
and the last one to leave.
(laughs)

31:04.230 --> 31:05.898
My God.

31:05.932 --> 31:08.234
Oh, I never thought
I'd live to hear you

31:08.267 --> 31:11.203
breathe a kindness
about Joan Crawford.

31:11.237 --> 31:12.771
Well, don't tell a soul.

31:12.804 --> 31:15.942
It will cut all my talk show
appearances in half

31:15.975 --> 31:19.011
if anyone thinks that
I've gone soft on Crawfish.

31:19.045 --> 31:20.546
Mm.

31:22.949 --> 31:25.384
She has cancer, you know.

31:27.053 --> 31:28.587
What?

31:28.620 --> 31:32.458
Hasn't left her apartment
in months, I hear.

31:34.793 --> 31:38.230
Cancer isn't going
to kill Joan.

31:38.264 --> 31:40.266
She's a cockroach,
just like me.

31:40.299 --> 31:41.667
(laughs)

31:43.936 --> 31:45.604
You should call her.

31:45.637 --> 31:47.706
She doesn't want to talk to me.

31:47.739 --> 31:48.975
Of course
she would.

31:49.008 --> 31:50.977
You mean something
to her.

31:51.010 --> 31:54.046
You and she have so much
in common. You're both Aries.

31:54.080 --> 31:56.482
You're both single mothers
to angry children.

31:56.515 --> 31:58.550
You've each been married
four times.

31:58.584 --> 32:00.987
In many ways,
I hate to say this,

32:01.020 --> 32:03.589
but... she may be
the only person

32:03.622 --> 32:07.026
in the entire world who knows
how you really feel right now.

32:11.097 --> 32:14.133
I have been reading
in the columns...

32:14.166 --> 32:17.236
she's been saying very nice
things about Dunaway.

32:17.269 --> 32:20.572
She even said she would want
Faye Dunaway to play her

32:20.606 --> 32:22.108
in a picture.

32:22.141 --> 32:23.809
(chuckles)

32:23.842 --> 32:25.844
I should warn her.

32:28.047 --> 32:30.016
Yes.

32:30.049 --> 32:32.518
Go ahead and warn her.

32:37.023 --> 32:38.124
(music playing on TV)
Do you want to watch?

32:38.157 --> 32:40.292
(phone ringing)
Oh.

32:40.326 --> 32:42.995
Who's that?

32:43.029 --> 32:44.496
Hmm.

32:47.966 --> 32:49.535
Hello.

32:49.568 --> 32:51.570
Hello?

32:54.073 --> 32:56.075
This is Joan Crawford.

32:59.045 --> 33:02.648
Who's calling at this late hour?

33:04.350 --> 33:07.286
Is anyone there?

33:07.319 --> 33:09.321
Hello?

33:17.696 --> 33:20.232
Nobody there.

33:37.883 --> 33:39.885
(knocking)
Coming. (chuckles)

33:42.121 --> 33:44.590
Oh, Cathy darling.

33:44.623 --> 33:45.924
(laughs): Oh!

33:45.957 --> 33:47.526
Mommie dearest.
Oh.

33:47.559 --> 33:49.195
Oh, look.

33:49.228 --> 33:51.597
Oh, my little angels.

33:51.630 --> 33:54.100
Oh! (chuckles)
(bell dings)

33:54.133 --> 33:56.001
Oh, I think the microwave

33:56.034 --> 33:59.571
is the most wonderful invention
of the 20th century.

33:59.605 --> 34:02.274
(chuckles)
You don't mind paper plates,

34:02.308 --> 34:04.943
do you, dear?
Mamacita only comes in

34:04.976 --> 34:08.614
three times a week, and I...
I hate to leave a mess for her.

34:08.647 --> 34:11.049
No, Mommie,
that's fine.
(dog whimpering)

34:11.083 --> 34:13.885
Oh, there's my darling girl,

34:13.919 --> 34:16.088
there's my sweet girl.

34:16.122 --> 34:18.124
(indistinct chatter)

34:20.092 --> 34:22.428
Ah.

34:22.461 --> 34:25.964
Mommie.
Hmm?

34:25.997 --> 34:28.400
I'm worried
about you.

34:28.434 --> 34:30.802
Mamacita says you've
stopped seeing your doctor.

34:30.836 --> 34:33.038
Yes, dear, that's right.

34:33.071 --> 34:35.141
Do you think
that's wise?

34:35.174 --> 34:37.776
Well...

34:37.809 --> 34:39.878
Western medicine thinks it can

34:39.911 --> 34:43.081
poison this cancer out of me,

34:43.115 --> 34:45.951
but since I've
adopted the tenets

34:45.984 --> 34:47.986
of Christian Science,

34:48.019 --> 34:50.756
I have been feeling
a wonderful new vigor,

34:50.789 --> 34:52.424
I really have.

34:52.458 --> 34:55.594
I feel like I could take
anything life could throw at me.

34:55.627 --> 34:57.629
(laughs)

34:59.198 --> 35:02.000
Speaking of which,

35:02.033 --> 35:03.969
have you talked to your sister?

35:04.002 --> 35:05.971
Cindy and I speak all the time.

35:06.004 --> 35:07.339
Oh, no, darling.

35:07.373 --> 35:09.107
I know you and Cindy do.

35:09.141 --> 35:11.410
Of course you do.
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

35:11.443 --> 35:13.445
No, I... I was referring

35:13.479 --> 35:16.014
to your elder sister,
to Christina.

35:18.184 --> 35:20.252
Uh, no.

35:20.286 --> 35:22.254
Not recently.

35:22.288 --> 35:24.856
My editor tells me

35:24.890 --> 35:27.926
she's been
writing a book.
Oh.

35:27.959 --> 35:30.429
It's about me, evidently.

35:30.462 --> 35:33.199
Alleging the most vile things.

35:36.001 --> 35:39.938
You have to understand...

35:39.971 --> 35:43.542
I was at the height of my career

35:43.575 --> 35:45.444
when she was little.

35:45.477 --> 35:48.980
We never enjoyed the
quality time together

35:49.014 --> 35:51.283
like I had with you and Cindy.

35:51.317 --> 35:54.553
The little time that I did have,

35:54.586 --> 35:56.622
I worked so hard

35:56.655 --> 35:59.791
at instilling the
proper values in her.

35:59.825 --> 36:02.561
I only wanted her

36:02.594 --> 36:06.732
to appreciate her advantages.

36:06.765 --> 36:08.767
Of course, Mommie, of course.

36:10.902 --> 36:13.639
My editor asked if...

36:13.672 --> 36:16.475
I wanted to read
an advance copy

36:16.508 --> 36:18.677
of the galleys, but...

36:18.710 --> 36:22.180
why spend the days of your life

36:22.214 --> 36:25.417
reading something
that could only hurt you?

36:25.451 --> 36:27.319
(clattering)
Children,

36:27.353 --> 36:30.422
I told you before we got here,
no sliding on Grandma's floors.

36:30.456 --> 36:32.858
No, no, no.
It's all right, dear.

36:32.891 --> 36:34.560
(chuckles)

36:34.593 --> 36:36.495
Look, they're
enjoying themselves.

36:36.528 --> 36:39.064
Just be careful.
Don't hurt yourselves.

36:39.097 --> 36:42.534
No, what's a few scuff marks?
It doesn't matter.

36:42.568 --> 36:45.571
(children laughing)

36:45.604 --> 36:49.408
Do they think of me as
their real grandmother?

36:49.441 --> 36:50.976
Of course.

36:56.415 --> 36:59.585
I don't know how much
they understand

36:59.618 --> 37:02.020
about you being adopted.

37:02.053 --> 37:06.292
No, Mommie,
they understand

37:06.325 --> 37:09.795
that you picked me
and their Aunt Cindy

37:09.828 --> 37:13.432
out of all of the children
in the world.

37:13.465 --> 37:18.203
And that we wouldn't have chosen
any other mother,

37:18.236 --> 37:22.541
because we had the best one
anyone could ever have.

37:22.574 --> 37:23.875
(sobs)

37:23.909 --> 37:25.110
Okay?

37:25.143 --> 37:27.446
Oh.

37:27.479 --> 37:29.214
(sniffles)

37:29.247 --> 37:31.617
(children laughing)

37:34.286 --> 37:36.655
(lightning crashing)

37:36.688 --> 37:39.925
(groaning)

37:39.958 --> 37:41.593
(thunder rumbles)

37:41.627 --> 37:44.029
(laughter in distance)

37:46.264 --> 37:48.434
(glasses clink)

37:48.467 --> 37:50.536
(laughter continues)

37:56.708 --> 37:59.144
(The Flamingos' "I Only Have
Eyes for You" playing)

38:01.880 --> 38:03.782
Hello?
* My love must be *

38:03.815 --> 38:07.152
(laughter continues)
* A kind of blind love *

38:09.688 --> 38:13.291
* I can't see anyone but you *

38:13.325 --> 38:14.960
(laughter continues)

38:14.993 --> 38:16.962
Hello?

38:16.995 --> 38:20.131
* Sha-bop, sha-bop *

38:20.165 --> 38:22.300
* Sha-bop,
sha-bop *

38:22.334 --> 38:24.970
(laughter)

38:25.003 --> 38:26.972
* Sha-bop, sha-bop *

38:27.005 --> 38:28.707
(liquid pouring)

38:28.740 --> 38:30.208
* Sha-bop, sha-bop *
MAN: You remember?

38:30.241 --> 38:31.710
WOMAN:
I do.

38:31.743 --> 38:33.345
(laughter)
* Sha-bop, sha-bop *

38:33.379 --> 38:38.617
* Are the stars out tonight? *

38:38.650 --> 38:41.119
* I'm gonna get right up
and put on my clothes *

38:41.152 --> 38:43.955
* I'm gonna go right out
and take in all the shows *

38:43.989 --> 38:45.791
(both laughing)

38:45.824 --> 38:48.026
JOAN:
Hedda?

38:48.059 --> 38:51.463
Jack, what are you doing here?

38:51.497 --> 38:54.466
Oh, Joan, did you ever hear
of the Cataract?

38:54.500 --> 38:56.368
Not the C...
(laughs)

38:56.402 --> 38:58.203
The Cascade.

38:58.236 --> 39:02.841
(laughs)
The Cascade.
(laughs)

39:02.874 --> 39:06.344
Oh. A movie house
Jack and his brothers

39:06.378 --> 39:09.080
used to run
in Pennsylvania.
Yeah.

39:09.114 --> 39:11.850
That's right.
Sam ran the picture,

39:11.883 --> 39:14.853
Abe kept the books,
Harry broke the balls,

39:14.886 --> 39:17.188
and I broke the hearts.
Aw. (chuckles)

39:17.222 --> 39:20.191
He used to sing in the aisles
between showings.

39:20.225 --> 39:22.661
Oh, Jack.

39:22.694 --> 39:25.397
Sing for Joan.

39:25.431 --> 39:28.900
* I'm gonna borrow from
everybody on my staff *

39:28.934 --> 39:31.737
* I'm going drink and
dance and drive and laugh *

39:31.770 --> 39:33.505
* The doctor says
my days are done *

39:33.539 --> 39:35.574
* So if I die, I'm
gonna have some fun. *

39:35.607 --> 39:38.043
(all laughing)

39:40.311 --> 39:42.448
Oh, Jack, if a young actor
had come in

39:42.481 --> 39:44.115
and sung like that for you,

39:44.149 --> 39:46.552
you'd have put him
on the first bus out of town.

39:46.585 --> 39:50.121
Yeah. Thank God I
never had any talent.
Mm.

39:50.155 --> 39:51.523
That makes two of us.

39:51.557 --> 39:56.928
I had plenty of talent,
Mr. Warner.

39:56.962 --> 40:01.099
I just had the foresight
not to be the talent forever.

40:01.132 --> 40:03.769
Well, now, what is wrong
with being the talent?

40:03.802 --> 40:07.973
Well, everyone thinks you have
the world on a string,

40:08.006 --> 40:09.908
but it's the other way around.

40:09.941 --> 40:12.744
It's much better to be the one
pulling the string, darling.

40:12.778 --> 40:13.979
Oh.

40:14.012 --> 40:15.413
I know that. Yes, indeed.

40:15.447 --> 40:17.315
You two made my life miserable.

40:17.348 --> 40:21.920
Made every job I ever had
a fight to the death.

40:21.953 --> 40:24.389
Oh, come on, Joan.
You act like you're the only one

40:24.422 --> 40:25.924
who had to cup your balls and do

40:25.957 --> 40:28.093
hand-to-hand combat.
Think about

40:28.126 --> 40:30.428
all those WASPs
who didn't let

40:30.462 --> 40:32.330
our kids into private schools,

40:32.363 --> 40:36.234
who told me to be a good Jew and
go back to the garment district.

40:36.267 --> 40:37.803
And you know better
than anyone, Joan,

40:37.836 --> 40:40.472
my hundred years' war
with Louella.

40:40.506 --> 40:44.743
Yes, but no one was taking sides
against you.

40:44.776 --> 40:48.847
No one was throwing gasoline
on your resentments.

40:48.880 --> 40:53.151
Well, the expression
is not "unite and conquer."

40:53.184 --> 40:55.987
(laughing)

40:56.021 --> 40:59.257
No, but why?
Why did I need to be conquered?

40:59.290 --> 41:01.760
BETTE:
What other way was there?

41:01.793 --> 41:05.263
Let the animals run the zoo?
(chuckles)

41:05.296 --> 41:08.133
What is she doing here?

41:08.166 --> 41:10.936
Be friendly, Joan.
We're having a party.

41:10.969 --> 41:14.472
Tell 'em what it did to you,
Joan.

41:14.506 --> 41:17.676
Tell 'em what
they did to you.

41:17.709 --> 41:21.312
Tell us. Go on, darling.

41:21.346 --> 41:23.849
* Sha-bop, sha-bop... *

41:23.882 --> 41:26.484
Well, I suppose...

41:26.518 --> 41:30.321
I felt
like I always had to be on.

41:30.355 --> 41:33.391
That if someone caught a glimpse
of the girl

41:33.424 --> 41:36.027
beneath the movie star,
then, poof,

41:36.061 --> 41:40.699
I'd go back to that sad
little wretch I'd been.

41:40.732 --> 41:43.702
You know, so...

41:43.735 --> 41:46.137
(sighs)

41:46.171 --> 41:50.141
...I spent my whole life

41:50.175 --> 41:53.211
being Joan Crawford.

41:53.244 --> 41:55.213
(chuckles)

41:55.246 --> 41:59.184
A woman I created for others.

41:59.217 --> 42:01.219
* Sha-bop, sha-bop *

42:03.288 --> 42:05.256
* Sha-bop, sha-bop... *

42:05.290 --> 42:09.260
I don't know who-who I am

42:09.294 --> 42:12.898
when I'm by myself.

42:14.566 --> 42:16.868
* Sha-bop, sha-bop... *

42:16.902 --> 42:20.205
I think you should apologize
to Joan, Jack.

42:20.238 --> 42:22.207
Both of you should.

42:22.240 --> 42:26.244
Uh... well, I'll do it
if he does.

42:26.277 --> 42:28.580
All right.

42:28.614 --> 42:30.582
On the count of three.

42:30.616 --> 42:32.383
One...

42:32.417 --> 42:34.085
two...
Two...

42:34.119 --> 42:35.921
three.
three.

42:36.955 --> 42:38.890
(all laughing)

42:42.961 --> 42:44.362
It wouldn't
come out!

42:44.395 --> 42:46.898
(laughing):
No.

42:46.932 --> 42:48.734
Oh... (laughs)
JACK: Now, Joanie,
look, look,

42:48.767 --> 42:50.702
if I...
if I really had known

42:50.736 --> 42:54.706
how hard I-I'd really made
it for you, I...

42:54.740 --> 42:57.142
I wouldn't have done
a fucking thing different...

42:57.175 --> 42:59.444
(all laughing)
Bastard.

43:01.479 --> 43:03.915
It all works out
in the end, Joanie.

43:03.949 --> 43:06.652
You know, we showbiz folks,

43:06.685 --> 43:10.255
you know, all that anger that
we feel from not being loved--

43:10.288 --> 43:12.090
which is the reason
we're in this business

43:12.123 --> 43:13.825
in the first place--

43:13.859 --> 43:17.062
all the tears and the screaming
and the-the rage,

43:17.095 --> 43:19.330
it all disappears.

43:19.364 --> 43:20.732
And the public,

43:20.766 --> 43:22.734
what they remember,
for the most part,

43:22.768 --> 43:24.269
is the good stuff.

43:25.671 --> 43:27.305
The work.

43:27.338 --> 43:30.508
And all the joy
that we brought them.

43:30.541 --> 43:33.011
Trust me,

43:33.044 --> 43:36.648
all the suffering
will have been worth it.

43:36.682 --> 43:39.084
Will it, really?

43:39.117 --> 43:41.486
All that pain

43:41.519 --> 43:44.956
will finally amount
to something?

43:44.990 --> 43:47.158
Don't worry, sweetheart.

43:47.192 --> 43:50.161
You will
always be young,

43:50.195 --> 43:51.763
always be beautiful,

43:51.797 --> 43:54.165
a goddess of your time,

43:54.199 --> 43:57.068
frozen in amber by Hurrell.

44:00.706 --> 44:02.674
Bette, too,

44:02.708 --> 44:05.010
though it pains
me to say it.

44:06.044 --> 44:09.080
Legends, all.

44:15.687 --> 44:17.889
Oh, come on. Let's have a drink.

44:17.923 --> 44:19.157
Oh, I...

44:19.190 --> 44:21.793
I don't drink anymore.

44:21.827 --> 44:24.796
Boring. All right,
come on, Hedda.

44:24.830 --> 44:26.631
Help me make some
drinks, all right?

44:26.664 --> 44:28.633
Nobody wields an ice
pick quite like you.

44:28.666 --> 44:30.168
(chuckles)

44:32.704 --> 44:35.273
Nice apartment.

44:36.274 --> 44:38.977
You get out much?

44:39.010 --> 44:41.179
Theater?
The Guggenheim?

44:41.212 --> 44:44.816
No, uh, not so much, no.

44:44.850 --> 44:46.818
(laughs)
Neither do I.

44:46.852 --> 44:50.555
Do you know what I love the most
in this world?

44:50.588 --> 44:53.558
The Young and the Restless.

44:53.591 --> 44:57.395
Oh. Yes,
that beautiful sea captain.
(chuckles)

44:57.428 --> 44:58.897
What is his name?
Lucas Prentiss.

44:58.930 --> 45:01.699
That's right.
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

45:04.736 --> 45:08.239
Why am I so happy to see you?

45:09.307 --> 45:11.042
Nostalgia.

45:11.076 --> 45:12.610
Hmm.

45:12.643 --> 45:14.045
Let's play a game.

45:14.079 --> 45:16.882
It's called Regrets.

45:16.915 --> 45:18.683
Oh.
No, no, no.

45:18.716 --> 45:20.685
If you draw a pip card,

45:20.718 --> 45:24.022
you say something you
feel sorry you did.

45:24.055 --> 45:26.024
If you draw a face card,

45:26.057 --> 45:29.360
you say something
you wish you had done.

45:29.394 --> 45:32.798
That doesn't sound
like a very fun game.

45:32.831 --> 45:35.834
It's the only game I know.
(chuckles)

45:47.779 --> 45:50.581
I'm sorry...

45:50.615 --> 45:53.985
I wasn't more generous with you.

46:05.964 --> 46:07.698
I wish...

46:12.770 --> 46:16.842
I wish I'd been a friend to you.

46:20.478 --> 46:23.181
(chuckles)

46:23.214 --> 46:26.017
Well, it's not too late, is it?

46:26.051 --> 46:28.253
We can start now.

46:28.286 --> 46:29.855
(chuckles)

46:29.888 --> 46:31.957
Let's have

46:31.990 --> 46:33.791
a champagne toast.

46:33.825 --> 46:36.594
Mamacita!

46:36.627 --> 46:39.764
Oh, I'm so glad
that you came here.

46:39.797 --> 46:41.332
You know, I've often

46:41.366 --> 46:45.971
fantasized about staying up late
like two girlfriends,

46:46.004 --> 46:48.373
talking about Bob and,

46:48.406 --> 46:49.774
well, all the other men

46:49.807 --> 46:52.377
that we've known along the way.
(laughs)

46:52.410 --> 46:54.312
Mamacita!

46:54.345 --> 46:57.048
The champagne!

46:57.082 --> 46:59.650
It's silly that we've
spent all these years

46:59.684 --> 47:02.320
at odds with each other.

47:02.353 --> 47:05.823
But we can start over.

47:05.857 --> 47:09.660
Why don't you stay here with me,
as my guest?

47:09.694 --> 47:12.230
You don't have to rush back
to Connecticut,

47:12.263 --> 47:13.865
do you?
MAMACITA:
Miss Joan.

47:13.899 --> 47:16.234
What are you doing?

47:16.267 --> 47:18.236
Bring the champagne, dear.

47:18.269 --> 47:20.038
You are not drinking.

47:20.071 --> 47:22.874
Well, then bring some
for my friend, Bette.

47:23.875 --> 47:26.912
There is no one there.

47:26.945 --> 47:29.380
(thunder rumbling)

47:31.883 --> 47:33.885
She must have slipped out.

47:35.887 --> 47:37.588
Did you help

47:37.622 --> 47:41.859
Hedda and Jack in the kitchen?

47:47.065 --> 47:49.600
Come, Miss Joan.

47:49.634 --> 47:52.137
Come. We go to bed.

48:02.880 --> 48:04.349
Good.

48:04.382 --> 48:07.252
I-I can't go to bed.

48:07.285 --> 48:09.454
I have guests.

48:09.487 --> 48:12.290
There is no one else here.

48:12.323 --> 48:15.760
It is just you and I.

48:40.018 --> 48:42.620
Thank you, Mamacita.

48:47.492 --> 48:50.928
MAMACITA:
She died one week later.

48:50.962 --> 48:54.232
We embalmed her.

48:54.265 --> 48:57.402
We made her look
the way she liked.

48:57.435 --> 49:00.271
And then we cremated her body.

49:00.305 --> 49:02.107
She had a big funeral, yeah?

49:02.140 --> 49:04.942
Not as big as Judy Garland's,
but star-studded?

49:04.976 --> 49:06.111
Yes.

49:06.144 --> 49:09.981
Myrna Loy, Anita Loos,
Andy Warhol.

49:10.015 --> 49:13.918
Jack Valenti got the studios
to observe a moment of silence.

49:13.951 --> 49:16.521
It made me sad.

49:16.554 --> 49:19.124
To say good-bye to her?

49:19.157 --> 49:22.327
No, because they all showed up

49:22.360 --> 49:24.595
to say good-bye.

49:24.629 --> 49:29.134
But when she was alive,
when she needed them most,

49:29.167 --> 49:32.103
no one was there.

49:32.137 --> 49:34.305
(phone ringing)

49:39.677 --> 49:40.878
What?

49:40.911 --> 49:42.313
Miss Davis,

49:42.347 --> 49:45.550
this is Jan Tomlinson
with the AP Wire Service.

49:45.583 --> 49:47.518
Good morning.

49:47.552 --> 49:50.721
Ah, I've lost track of the days.

49:50.755 --> 49:54.559
Are there nominations announced
or something?

49:54.592 --> 49:56.561
No, Miss Davis.

49:56.594 --> 49:59.064
Joan Crawford died this
morning.

50:04.102 --> 50:06.371
Do you have a comment?

50:10.841 --> 50:12.810
My mother always said

50:12.843 --> 50:15.980
don't say anything bad
about the dead.

50:16.013 --> 50:18.749
Only say good.

50:20.418 --> 50:23.554
Joan Crawford is dead.

50:23.588 --> 50:25.590
Good.

50:48.279 --> 50:50.281
I was in the neighborhood.
Oh, Miss Davis.

50:50.315 --> 50:52.950
Is she in her room?
Uh, yes.

50:52.983 --> 50:54.785
BETTE:
Margot, darling.

50:54.819 --> 50:56.087
It's Mommy.

50:56.121 --> 50:58.189
Hello, sweetheart.

50:58.223 --> 51:01.292
Oh, look what you're doing.

51:01.326 --> 51:03.060
What a nice drawing.

51:03.094 --> 51:06.864
Look at how beautifully you're
filling those hearts in.

51:06.897 --> 51:08.766
I did a drawing, myself.

51:08.799 --> 51:10.868
Well, I didn't actually
do the drawing.

51:10.901 --> 51:14.071
A lovely man named
Don did it. I met him

51:14.105 --> 51:15.306
at Roddy McDowall's.

51:15.340 --> 51:16.641
Do you remember him?

51:16.674 --> 51:21.479
BETTE: We had a wonderful date,
a wonderful time.

51:26.751 --> 51:28.919
(clears throat)

51:28.953 --> 51:31.088
Miss Davis.

51:31.122 --> 51:32.490
I don't mean to seem rude,

51:32.523 --> 51:35.460
but you need to sit still.

51:39.197 --> 51:41.899
Fine.

51:41.932 --> 51:43.734
You have an hour. That's it.

51:43.768 --> 51:45.136
Okay.

51:46.171 --> 51:48.506
Can... Your chin... Just...

51:48.539 --> 51:50.875
Mmm.

51:54.145 --> 51:57.915
Would you like to stay
for dinner?

51:57.948 --> 52:00.651
All right.

52:00.685 --> 52:02.187
But...

52:02.220 --> 52:04.355
But. But.

52:04.389 --> 52:07.758
You do know I'm gay?

52:07.792 --> 52:10.127
Of course.

52:10.161 --> 52:13.264
BETTE: We had a wonderful dinner
that night,

52:13.298 --> 52:16.601
but it would never work out
with Don because of my work.

52:16.634 --> 52:19.337
My work has always
taken first position,

52:19.370 --> 52:21.472
and men don't want that.
But I would rather

52:21.506 --> 52:24.275
go for something I feel
even if I get hurt.

52:24.309 --> 52:27.812
I don't want to spend my
life protecting myself.

52:27.845 --> 52:30.114
After dinner, the painter, Don,

52:30.147 --> 52:32.617
he showed me the
drawing that he made.

52:32.650 --> 52:36.954
It captured the way
I am now completely.

52:36.987 --> 52:38.723
BETTE:
Can I see it now?

52:38.756 --> 52:40.558
(clears throat)

52:40.591 --> 52:42.026
It's not finished yet.

52:42.059 --> 52:43.494
Don't you like it?

52:43.528 --> 52:46.731
Honestly, it...

52:46.764 --> 52:49.734
(chuckles) It sort of scares me.

52:49.767 --> 52:53.170
Then I want to see it.

53:06.217 --> 53:09.186
Yep.

53:09.220 --> 53:11.856
That's the old bag.

53:21.432 --> 53:23.501
BETTE: I'm sorry
that I haven't been to see you

53:23.534 --> 53:24.869
more often, darling,

53:24.902 --> 53:27.405
but I'm going to
write you letters.

53:27.438 --> 53:29.274
Beautiful letters.

53:29.307 --> 53:31.742
And we'll keep them
in a special box.

53:31.776 --> 53:34.111
Would you like that?

53:34.144 --> 53:37.348
Last week someone
sent me letters

53:37.382 --> 53:40.017
that my mother had written
to a friend of hers

53:40.050 --> 53:43.854
years ago before she died.

53:43.888 --> 53:47.958
BETTE: Many of the letters
were about me.

53:54.632 --> 53:56.467
Long story short,

53:56.501 --> 54:00.971
my mother said terrible things
about me behind my back.

54:01.005 --> 54:04.409
She said that I was a queen bee.

54:04.442 --> 54:07.578
And that I was selfish.

54:07.612 --> 54:09.614
And that it was all about me,

54:09.647 --> 54:12.283
and that I was a
pain and a chore.

54:15.520 --> 54:18.088
She'd never said anything to me.

54:20.591 --> 54:22.092
My own mother.

54:22.126 --> 54:25.896
I thought she was
my only friend.

54:25.930 --> 54:28.799
But actually...

54:28.833 --> 54:32.603
I was totally alone.

54:35.506 --> 54:39.610
(applause)

54:39.644 --> 54:41.178
What's your pick for Best
Picture, Miss Davis?

54:41.211 --> 54:43.681
Oh, I'd have to say
The Turning Point.

54:43.714 --> 54:45.350
It was my favorite film
this year.

54:45.383 --> 54:47.918
The men are
merely dance partners,

54:47.952 --> 54:50.788
and the women fight on the roof.
It's the story of my life.

54:50.821 --> 54:52.156
(Bette and bartender chuckle)
Bette?

54:52.189 --> 54:54.158
Are you giving Charlton
an award?

54:54.191 --> 54:55.593
Chuck Heston, yes.

54:55.626 --> 54:58.629
He's the only actor
that's as difficult as I am.

54:58.663 --> 55:02.099
The Jean Hersholt
Humanitarian Award?

55:02.132 --> 55:03.701
(chuckles) Oh, I
don't give a shit.

55:03.734 --> 55:07.271
I'm not here to present,
I'm here to preside.

55:07.304 --> 55:08.539
(chuckles)

55:08.573 --> 55:09.874
BLONDELL:
Hey, ladies,

55:09.907 --> 55:11.208
it's the "In Memoriam."

55:11.241 --> 55:13.811
Christ, where did the night go?

55:13.844 --> 55:18.315
(over television):
* Oh, just one more time *

55:18.349 --> 55:20.951
* Just close your eyes *

55:20.985 --> 55:25.456
* And we'll see
their face again *

55:25.490 --> 55:30.361
* Though your days are gone *

55:30.395 --> 55:33.898
* They live on *

55:33.931 --> 55:36.133
* And on *

55:36.166 --> 55:40.871
* Let their song play *

55:40.905 --> 55:42.673
* One more time *

55:42.707 --> 55:44.208
That's it?

55:44.241 --> 55:46.977
BLONDELL: Christ. 50
years in show business,

55:47.011 --> 55:50.648
and they give her two seconds.

55:50.681 --> 55:54.485
* One more time. *
That's all any of us will get.

55:54.519 --> 55:56.587
To Joan.

55:56.621 --> 55:58.689
(applause)

56:03.394 --> 56:05.430
MAN:
Clean wearing,
long lasting foundation.

56:05.463 --> 56:06.731
Worn by the world's
great beauties...

56:10.901 --> 56:13.003
Miss Davis.

56:13.037 --> 56:15.773
Hi, I'm Adam.

56:17.808 --> 56:20.445
Yes.

56:20.478 --> 56:22.613
Hi.

56:22.647 --> 56:24.782
I told you in a letter,

56:24.815 --> 56:26.116
I told you on the phone,

56:26.150 --> 56:28.085
and now I'll tell you
to your face.

56:28.118 --> 56:31.388
I will not participate
in your documentary.

56:31.422 --> 56:34.358
You'll want me to say
funny, bitchy one-liners

56:34.391 --> 56:35.593
about Crawford.

56:35.626 --> 56:37.762
I won't do it.

56:37.795 --> 56:40.197
She was a professional.

56:40.230 --> 56:42.467
We did one picture together.

56:42.500 --> 56:45.235
Our lives intersected.

56:45.269 --> 56:47.805
That's it.

56:47.838 --> 56:50.074
I don't have anything more
to say.

56:50.107 --> 56:52.309
MAN:
Miss Davis, you're on next.

56:57.181 --> 56:58.983
ADAM:
Well, I guess that's it.

56:59.016 --> 57:01.486
We'll never really know

57:01.519 --> 57:04.154
what happened
between these two women.

57:04.188 --> 57:06.991
I want to know
what happened that first day.

57:07.024 --> 57:10.327
When they finally
were on a set together

57:10.360 --> 57:12.763
after all those years
of their feud.

57:12.797 --> 57:14.765
(bell rings)

57:14.799 --> 57:17.134
That's what I want to know.

57:27.778 --> 57:30.648
(laughs)

57:30.681 --> 57:32.617
(both chuckle)

57:32.650 --> 57:35.520
So I put a...
a rubber band around it,

57:35.553 --> 57:38.155
and I went back into the party.
What choice did I have?

57:38.188 --> 57:39.423
(both laugh)

57:39.456 --> 57:40.991
PAULINE: Miss Crawford,
Miss Davis.

57:41.025 --> 57:42.326
Bob is calling

57:42.359 --> 57:43.628

57:43.661 --> 57:44.829
All ready?

57:44.862 --> 57:46.597
I'll get my script.

57:46.631 --> 57:48.633
Wonderful.

57:50.868 --> 57:52.069
Bette?

57:54.371 --> 57:56.807
Here's what I really hope
from this picture

57:56.841 --> 58:00.778
when all is said and done:

58:00.811 --> 58:04.715
I hope I've made a new friend.

58:05.716 --> 58:08.553
Me, too.

58:35.846 --> 58:38.583

59:05.475 --> 59:07.477
