WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:08.321
Oh, man,
we have a small problem.
- Word?

00:08.330 --> 00:09.991
-This hacker guy,
he took all of it.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.820
That Blush dude money.
All that money.

00:11.830 --> 00:13.695
-Uggh!
-Committed multiple felonies.

00:13.790 --> 00:15.860
-We got hacked.
-But you didn't report it.

00:15.950 --> 00:18.362
-Someone had to know, someone
who'd been following the money.

00:18.450 --> 00:20.827
-Hey, that's hood money, dawg.
That money belonged to me.

00:20.870 --> 00:23.828
-If they don't get 300 from me,
they're coming for you.

00:23.830 --> 00:25.991
-We have a meeting
with Alex Bell on Tuesday.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.651
-We take our 20 G's,
make 'em think they're about

00:28.660 --> 00:30.491
to be part
of something cutting edge.

00:30.540 --> 00:32.861
Then ask them to double down.
-It's actually a Ponzi scheme.

00:32.910 --> 00:34.696
-I'm sure my lawyers
can sort all this out.

00:34.750 --> 00:35.785
-Shit.
-Where you going, blood?

00:35.830 --> 00:37.946
-I have an idea.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.696
-Ready for this
ass-whuppin' boy?
Huh?

00:40.750 --> 00:43.287
Oh, yeah.
Oh, you are. Okay.

00:43.330 --> 00:46.151
What you doin'?
What you doin'?
Get off, man.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.828
Ooh, too big for you.
Too big for you, look at you.

00:48.830 --> 00:50.991
Ahh! Whoo!

00:51.040 --> 00:53.076

00:53.160 --> 00:55.993
'Cause your daddy
can't ball for shit.
Now watch this.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.821
Come on, little nigga,
I own these courts.

00:58.830 --> 01:00.946
Me, not you, me.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.820
I own these courts, boy!

01:02.830 --> 01:03.819
Yeah.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.116
Oh, you think you--

01:07.160 --> 01:09.071
Come on, son.

01:09.120 --> 01:10.997
Come on, little nigga,
you don't own these courts.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.399
I own these courts, me!

01:15.500 --> 01:17.650
Ah!

01:17.700 --> 01:19.782

01:19.830 --> 01:21.400
Huh?

01:21.450 --> 01:22.826
Oh, yeah.

01:22.870 --> 01:24.826
That's called a rejection, son.

01:24.870 --> 01:26.656
You got rejected.

01:26.700 --> 01:28.327
Here you go.

What's up with it?
Come on, little nigga.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.491

02:11.540 --> 02:13.531
He off doin' his own thing now,

02:25.330 --> 02:26.945
-You know,

02:28.160 --> 02:29.616
Oh, you ain't?

02:29.660 --> 02:30.900
-Nah, I'm straight, dawg.

02:33.120 --> 02:35.076

02:52.330 --> 02:55.037
And shit with Lib City

03:00.040 --> 03:01.439
You feel me?

03:02.660 --> 03:03.866
-I feel you.

03:05.790 --> 03:09.078
-You're gonna have to make
a choice, little homey.

03:09.120 --> 03:12.999
You gonna go down
with your daddy's ship...

03:13.080 --> 03:15.492
or you gonna ride high with me,
O, and the rest?

03:33.160 --> 03:34.991
You gonna be great, man.

You gonna own these streets.

03:39.330 --> 03:40.319

Kings, dawg. Feel me?

03:50.290 --> 03:51.905
-I feel you.

03:58.910 --> 04:00.946
-Out, out.

04:04.450 --> 04:05.940
-Get your game on, lil' nigga.

06:01.660 --> 06:04.538
- Shit.

06:04.580 --> 06:07.538
-Uh, excuse me, Mr. Bell. Hi.
-Sorry, now is not a good time.

06:07.580 --> 06:10.287
-Yeah. You guys
going up to RadCoin,
meeting Maya Hibert?

06:10.330 --> 06:11.649
-Yeah.

06:11.700 --> 06:13.440
-Yeah. You don't know me,
although you should,

06:13.500 --> 06:15.695
so I'm gonna give you
one of these.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.150
What you're about to hear
up there is bullshit.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.906
RadCoin is bullshit.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.820
It's a gimmick.

06:21.830 --> 06:24.321
This right here
is the real deal.

06:24.330 --> 06:26.901
It's the future of currency,
but I'll let you decide
for yourself.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.786
My number's on the back.

06:28.830 --> 06:30.821
Maya, she can't stand
in this game alone,

06:30.870 --> 06:32.440
- I hope you know that.
- Thanks.

06:32.500 --> 06:33.819
-Okay.

06:33.830 --> 06:36.151
- Alex.
- Yeah.

06:44.910 --> 06:46.696
-Hey, Pauly.
-Ah, my man.

06:46.750 --> 06:48.695
The usual?
-Please.

06:53.250 --> 06:54.615
Oh, shit.

06:54.660 --> 06:57.367
Listen, I'm sorry.
Gotta be that guy.

06:57.410 --> 06:58.820
Ha ha, no problem, Phil.

07:00.540 --> 07:01.905
-Charge me the $2 fee.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.492
- No worries, my man.
- I got you.

07:23.500 --> 07:27.539
--Whoops. This one says declined.

07:28.580 --> 07:30.445
-What? Uh...

07:31.750 --> 07:33.900
All right, here, here.
Try this?

07:33.950 --> 07:36.327
-Okay.
-Thanks.

07:46.160 --> 07:49.368
Machine's had a mind
of its own lately.

07:50.660 --> 07:53.618
No worry.
Just take this one on me.

07:53.660 --> 07:55.696
No, Pauly,
you don't have to do that.

07:55.790 --> 07:58.497
-It's my pleasure.
I know you'll be back.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.490
Thanks.

08:07.950 --> 08:09.577
Hector.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.070
Agent Rask.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.690
Yeah.

08:18.750 --> 08:19.944
-Special Agent Kossaras.

08:21.450 --> 08:23.361
Special Agent Guerra,
Missing Persons.
-Hi.

08:23.410 --> 08:25.492
-We were just upstairs
chatting with your colleagues.

08:25.540 --> 08:27.155
-Right.

08:27.160 --> 08:29.822
-We're investigating
the disappearance
of Agent Pierce.

08:29.870 --> 08:32.691
Thought you might be able
to help us out.

08:32.750 --> 08:34.650
-Agent Pierce?
Is this-- is this a joke?

08:34.700 --> 08:36.531
I saw her the other day.

08:36.620 --> 08:38.326
Yesterday,
the other day?

08:38.330 --> 08:40.867
- No, not yesterday.
- It was, um, Tuesday, I think.

08:40.950 --> 08:44.158
_ -It's been over 48 hours
smce anyone's heard from her.

08:44.250 --> 08:46.150
She missed
two check-ins with HQ.

08:46.250 --> 08:47.945
- What?
- Were you working

08:48.000 --> 08:51.037
any investigations that may have
placed her in harm's way?

08:51.080 --> 08:54.288
Someone she was tailing,
someone she rubbed wrong?

08:54.330 --> 08:57.572
-Not that I can--
you don't think it's
anything serious, do you?

08:57.620 --> 08:59.406
We're exploring
every possible angle.

08:59.450 --> 09:01.361
What about
the Andy Talman case?

09:01.410 --> 09:03.571
There was a link
to the LH7 gang there,
was there not?

09:03.620 --> 09:06.248
-A Ronald Dacey?
-Yeah, somewhat, somewhat,

09:06.290 --> 09:08.997
but I don't think
they would ever, uh--

09:09.000 --> 09:11.366
-Again, exploring
every angle here.

09:11.410 --> 09:14.368
As one of our own,
we have to be as aggressive
as possible.

09:14.410 --> 09:17.994
-Of course, yeah.
If there's anything I can do,
please, let me know.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.196
-All right.
We'll be in touch.
Thank you.

09:22.290 --> 09:23.996
- See you around.
- Yeah.

09:27.290 --> 09:28.405
Yeah.

09:47.950 --> 09:49.531
- Can you see my cards?
- No.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.327
-Thanks.
-10 yours? Do you want that?

10:01.370 --> 10:03.440
Yeah. Thank you.

10:25.160 --> 10:26.821
-Hello, this is Izzy.

10:27.910 --> 10:29.195
Yeah.

10:31.370 --> 10:32.746
Yeah.

10:34.700 --> 10:37.498
Uh... f-- can--
can you text me that?

10:38.500 --> 10:40.445
All right, uh, thank you.

10:42.160 --> 10:43.536
We're in.

10:43.620 --> 10:45.190
- Who that?
- Alex Bell.

10:45.290 --> 10:46.655
-That was him?

10:48.160 --> 10:49.491
Really?
-Yes.

10:49.580 --> 10:50.945
-When?
-Tomorrow.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.285
- That's great!
Woo-hoo!

10:52.330 --> 10:54.491
-He said to bring
our bathing suits.

10:54.500 --> 10:55.740
She. His assistant.

10:55.790 --> 10:57.655
- Why?
- I don't know.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.247
-Who is Alex?

10:59.290 --> 11:00.780
-Megan, shut up.

11:17.660 --> 11:18.740
-Yo.

11:18.830 --> 11:20.616
Yo. You didn't bring
your swimsuit?

11:21.950 --> 11:23.656
- Are you serious about that?
- Yeah.

11:23.700 --> 11:25.327
He said bring 'em.
I brought mine.

11:26.950 --> 11:28.440
-You bring yours?

11:28.500 --> 11:31.116
-I sure did, yeah.
I got an extra one in the trunk.

11:31.160 --> 11:33.947
-Pssh. I ain't puttin' my shit
in the same spot as your shit.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.991
Oh, my God.
You brought
a tank top, though?

11:36.000 --> 11:38.195
-Yo, Ronald, seriously.

11:38.250 --> 11:40.866
This guy's the real deal.
Like he's the new Elon Musk.

11:40.910 --> 11:43.447
If the man says,
"Bring a bathing suit"--

11:43.500 --> 11:45.070
shit.

11:45.120 --> 11:47.532
What is wrong with my hotspot?
You have Wi-Fi in here?

11:47.580 --> 11:49.241
-Probably.

11:49.290 --> 11:51.440
- Got it.
- Damn.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.149
Look at this.

11:54.160 --> 11:56.572
He has stakes in some
of the biggest tech companies

11:56.660 --> 11:59.493
out there right now.
The hypersonic scramjet thing.

11:59.540 --> 12:03.499
Get you from London to Sydney
in like two hours.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.491
If the man says,
"Let's go swimming,"
we go swimming.

12:05.540 --> 12:08.498
-Hey, look,
he's either buying what
the hell we selling or he ain't.

12:08.500 --> 12:10.149
It's all good, but I ain't
kissin' nobody's ass.

12:10.250 --> 12:11.899
- Man, you're stubborn.

12:11.950 --> 12:14.157
Why you got to be
so complicated?

12:14.160 --> 12:15.946
Okay, buckle up.

12:35.910 --> 12:38.151
- I hate pitching.
- You'll be all right.

12:38.160 --> 12:41.368
-You're really good at it.
-It makes me wanna puke.

12:41.410 --> 12:43.822
-You're passionate,
that's all that matters.

12:43.830 --> 12:45.115
-Why can't you do
the whole thing?

12:45.160 --> 12:46.536
-Because he doesn't want
to hear from me.

12:46.620 --> 12:48.326
You're the brilliant mind,
you're the creator.

12:48.330 --> 12:50.116
-And I sound like a damn fool.

12:50.160 --> 12:51.900
-Hey, I'm here, aren't I?
-Yeah.

12:51.950 --> 12:53.998
-I called you for a reason.
Remember that.

12:54.080 --> 12:55.445
-All right.
-Just take this.

12:56.830 --> 12:58.786
- GenCoin!
- Hey.

12:58.830 --> 13:00.695
-Hi!
-Hey, you guys, come on in.

13:02.370 --> 13:04.577

13:04.620 --> 13:07.191
-Good to meet you.
-Ronald. Sup?

13:07.250 --> 13:09.491
- Pleasure. How's it going?
- All good.

13:09.540 --> 13:12.532
-Yeah. Oh, well,
welcome, welcome, welcome.

13:12.580 --> 13:14.821
And we met_earlier.
Isabelle, right?

13:14.870 --> 13:17.998
-Yeah, you--
you can call me Izzy.
-Oh. Izzy, cool.

13:19.700 --> 13:22.498
-I'm sorry
I ambushed you earlier.

13:22.500 --> 13:26.322
-Oh, no. No, no, no.
It'll make a good story someday.

13:26.370 --> 13:29.362
-Yeah, I submitted to you guys
three times before.

13:29.450 --> 13:32.692
-Eh... I get
so many things on my desk.
You know how it is.

13:32.790 --> 13:34.439
- Yeah, for sure.
- I can imagine.

13:34.500 --> 13:37.822
-Yeah, that's why I figured
this was the best way.

13:37.830 --> 13:40.617
-Persistence, I dig it.

13:40.660 --> 13:42.696
Hey, and, lo and behold,

13:42.750 --> 13:44.786
it turns out
I've already heard about you.

13:44.830 --> 13:48.197
Nico Wexler.
Remember him from Stanford?

13:48.250 --> 13:50.195
-Ah, Nico...

13:50.250 --> 13:51.649
He remembers you.

13:51.700 --> 13:55.284
He works for me now.
Told me all about you.

13:55.330 --> 13:59.039
Said you were like...
scary smart.

13:59.080 --> 14:01.071
Sounds right.

14:01.160 --> 14:04.038
-Anyway-- good,
you brought your suits.

14:04.080 --> 14:06.036
- Yeah.
- Good.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.650
Yeah. Why we do that?

14:12.790 --> 14:14.940
-Whoo!

14:17.160 --> 14:18.491
That's nice.

14:20.620 --> 14:22.941
-Ronald, come on.
-Come on!

14:23.000 --> 14:24.365
I'm good.

14:24.410 --> 14:26.116
It's okay.

14:26.160 --> 14:29.323
- So, uh, GenCoin...
- Yes.

14:29.370 --> 14:31.827
- Super-cool sounding.
- Thank you.

14:31.870 --> 14:33.861
-Izzy, if you wanna just
sort of...

14:33.910 --> 14:36.697
Yes, uh, thank you.

14:36.750 --> 14:38.695
So, um, did you know,
in Saudi Arabia,

14:38.750 --> 14:40.820
women aren't allowed
to open a bank account?
Hey, Vera.

14:40.870 --> 14:42.406
Sorry, Isabelle, one second.

14:42.500 --> 14:44.695
Guys, this is Vera.

14:44.750 --> 14:46.536
She runs my life.

14:46.580 --> 14:47.899
-Pleasure.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.820
Part-time confidante,

14:49.870 --> 14:51.656
full-time ball and chain.

14:51.660 --> 14:52.866
Uh-huh.

14:52.950 --> 14:54.611
Ooh, yes.

14:58.620 --> 15:01.657
- Gonna have some?
- No.

15:01.750 --> 15:03.741
You're no fun, Vera.

15:03.790 --> 15:05.360
Kenji asked if you could

15:05.410 --> 15:07.071
join him
for_that conference call
In a few minutes.

15:07.120 --> 15:08.530
Tell him to wait for me.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.030
And Ronald.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.530
-Nah, I'm straight.

15:17.540 --> 15:19.246
-All right.

15:19.290 --> 15:21.611
Cheers.
-Cheers.

15:21.660 --> 15:23.992
--Good reach.

15:26.250 --> 15:28.150
-Mm! Yeah.

15:28.160 --> 15:31.652
Anyway, you were saying?
Saudi Arabia.

15:31.660 --> 15:34.117
Yeah. There' so many people
out there are hurting.

15:34.160 --> 15:38.904
Half of these people don't even
have access to personal banking.

15:38.950 --> 15:40.656
I totally get it.

15:40.660 --> 15:45.279
You know, new currency based
in a self-evolving source code.

15:45.330 --> 15:47.195
Human-proof, future-proof.

15:47.250 --> 15:49.150
-If your code works...
-It works.

15:49.200 --> 15:51.191
-...then it's all pretty genius.
-Yeah, it definitely works.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.150
I had it audited myself
before I signed her.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.691
-Yeah, I'm sure it does.

15:55.750 --> 15:59.322
And unlike RadCoin,
what you're proposing is,

15:59.370 --> 16:02.077
"There is
a problem out there..."
Mm-hmm.

16:02.120 --> 16:04.406
-"...and GenCoin
is the solution."

16:04.500 --> 16:06.036
That's good.

16:06.080 --> 16:09.322
That is essential for a startup.

16:09.330 --> 16:11.321
But for me...

16:11.330 --> 16:15.619
_ there's one other
Intangible component.

16:17.330 --> 16:18.615
Why?

16:21.950 --> 16:23.281
-Why what?

16:24.580 --> 16:25.990
-Why GenCoin?

16:26.000 --> 16:28.241
-Well, I mean, like I was
trying to tell you --

16:28.290 --> 16:31.191
-About how it can give
Third World communities
access to banking,

16:31.250 --> 16:33.445
how it can give
oppressed nations
the same rights we have?

16:33.500 --> 16:35.946
Yeah, sure,
heard it a million times.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.399
BitCoin, all those other
peer-to-peers,

16:37.450 --> 16:40.078
they're ready to die
on that hill, but why?

16:40.120 --> 16:41.860
-It ain't just that.

16:41.910 --> 16:43.696
GenCoin means currency
without banks, corporations.

16:43.750 --> 16:46.492
Say you some poor immigrant--
Sure, but why you?

16:47.540 --> 16:49.076
Why you, Izzy?

16:49.160 --> 16:50.650
Why you, Nick?

16:51.830 --> 16:55.152
Why do each of you care
about GenCoin?

16:55.200 --> 16:56.997
Besides the altruism.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.326
Come on, why?

17:00.620 --> 17:03.828
Why each of you?

17:03.910 --> 17:06.071
Alex.

17:06.120 --> 17:08.782
Kenji has to fly out soon.
-Okay, yeah. sure.

17:14.330 --> 17:16.491
So, let's do this.

17:17.910 --> 17:21.118
Vera and I will sign an NDA.

17:21.160 --> 17:23.822
Vera, you get Nico to look over
her code tonight.

17:23.870 --> 17:25.440
I'll have him sign an NDA too.

17:25.500 --> 17:28.537
And let's set something up.
Tomorrow, if possible.

17:28.580 --> 17:31.037
I'd love to come by the office,
see where it all began.

17:31.080 --> 17:32.069
-Great. That'd be great.
-Yeah.

17:32.160 --> 17:33.320
But more than anything,

17:33.370 --> 17:35.656
I need you to be able
to answer that question.

17:36.870 --> 17:39.657
_ You know what?
I Invest In a company,

17:39.660 --> 17:42.652
I'm not investing in the idea
or the infrastructure.

17:42.700 --> 17:45.749
I am investing in the people,

17:45.790 --> 17:48.657
the intangibles you can't really
put a price on.

17:49.950 --> 17:52.657
That's how you stay ahead
in tech.

17:52.700 --> 17:53.906
Sound good?

17:53.950 --> 17:56.362
Yeah. Very much.

17:56.410 --> 17:58.287
See you tomorrow.

18:06.040 --> 18:07.530
Homeboy smart.

18:07.580 --> 18:09.650
He knows how he
gonna market the shit.

18:09.660 --> 18:11.651
He already know how he gonna
monetize the shit.

18:11.700 --> 18:14.191
He knew that shit
before we came to his house

18:14.250 --> 18:17.196
like some chumps
holding swimming trunks.

18:17.290 --> 18:18.860
He wants to know why you.

18:18.950 --> 18:20.998
He wants to know
your personal story.

18:21.040 --> 18:24.032
Well, I can tell him
about microfinancing and NGOs.

18:24.120 --> 18:26.111
I can't imagine he wants
to hear that.

18:26.160 --> 18:27.741
-He definitely doesn't.

18:27.790 --> 18:29.906
-I mean,
you guys don't wanna hear that.
Try and tell you guys...

18:29.950 --> 18:31.247
I don't.

18:31.290 --> 18:33.076
It's a trick question.
He's fucking with us.

18:33.120 --> 18:36.078
We should push.
-Can't do that.

18:36.120 --> 18:38.111
-No, we can't do that?
What should we do?

18:38.160 --> 18:39.946
Just continue eating
Chinese food and not do nothing?

18:40.000 --> 18:41.285
We can't push.

18:41.330 --> 18:43.821
I'm past due with Jey-Jey.

18:43.870 --> 18:45.531
Blush's lawyers gonna
get off that elevator

18:45.580 --> 18:46.899
swinging their dicks at us.

18:46.950 --> 18:48.656
We need that cash yesterday.

18:51.660 --> 18:53.651
-I hear Mexico's nice.

19:09.120 --> 19:10.940
-Hello, Phil.

19:12.160 --> 19:13.650
You are early.

19:16.790 --> 19:18.781
Departure date today, yes?

19:18.830 --> 19:20.400
-Yeah.
-Okay.

19:22.040 --> 19:24.611
Originally, we have you going
into Mexico City,

19:24.660 --> 19:27.242
but things down there
are a little tense right now,

19:27.290 --> 19:28.826
so a new plan.

19:28.870 --> 19:30.610
We get you to Paris.

19:30.660 --> 19:33.993
You are Phil Rask,
a passenger to Paris.

19:34.040 --> 19:36.361
Uh, the most obvious
destination.

19:36.410 --> 19:40.323
In Paris, you'll be traveling
by train to Barcelona.

19:40.370 --> 19:42.497
Still you, still Phil Rask.

19:42.540 --> 19:44.189
A car will meet you
at Barcelona Sants

19:44.290 --> 19:46.110
and take you a few hours
out of the country.

19:46.160 --> 19:48.492
This is where you'll
meet our pilot.

19:48.500 --> 19:51.492
His name is not necessary,
but know he's very well trained.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.570
Worked for the States
during the Contra war.

19:53.620 --> 19:55.611
He's a good man.
I love this guy.

19:55.660 --> 19:59.198
Before you take off,
you've gotta burn your passport.

19:59.250 --> 20:01.946
All right.
Phil Rask will disappear,

20:02.000 --> 20:05.288
and you will land in Ireland
as, uh...

20:05.330 --> 20:06.866
Vincent Vick.

20:06.910 --> 20:08.787
-That's a terrible name.

20:08.830 --> 20:10.616
- Apologies.
- That's what we got.

20:10.660 --> 20:13.197
Uh, then in Ireland,

20:13.250 --> 20:15.036
when you're ready,
you will book

20:15.080 --> 20:18.698
a ferry ticket
to the Faroe Islands.

20:18.750 --> 20:21.321
Then you, Vincent Vick,
will be home.

20:22.790 --> 20:24.610
-So...

20:26.290 --> 20:27.655
Payment method?

20:27.660 --> 20:29.992
- Yeah, we can, uh...

20:30.000 --> 20:31.991
make a direct wire.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.649
It's cleared.

20:52.580 --> 20:54.150
-These accounts are empty.

20:56.250 --> 20:58.036
-Uh...

20:58.080 --> 21:00.150
Which-- what accounts
are you looking at?

21:00.160 --> 21:02.993
-There's only one on here.
-Let me see.

21:13.660 --> 21:16.288
Okay. Gimme-- gimme it.
Gimme it.

21:27.450 --> 21:29.406
Can you...

21:29.450 --> 21:30.656
open the door?

21:30.700 --> 21:31.906
Oh, yeah.

22:10.700 --> 22:12.327
-Hey, Ronnie.

22:13.330 --> 22:15.321
What they do?

22:17.370 --> 22:19.827
Yeah, didn't want it to be
this way.

22:19.830 --> 22:21.149
Just how I do, though.

22:22.500 --> 22:24.570
Jey-Jey wanna see you
in the room.

22:29.200 --> 22:30.497
Hm.

22:32.160 --> 22:33.366
Let's go.

22:46.000 --> 22:50.448
-Pop? Wait. What's going on?
-I'll be right back.

22:50.500 --> 22:53.071
- It's all good, little man.
- Jey just got some business.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.491
Come on, open up!

23:50.870 --> 23:52.826
Open up!
I'm not kidding here!

23:52.870 --> 23:54.781
- Settle down, my friend.
- Please. I'm coming.

23:54.830 --> 23:56.786
-Yeah, I'll settle down.
Open the door!

24:01.000 --> 24:03.571
Z-So, let me guess, uh...
change of mind?

24:03.620 --> 24:05.156
-Did he come back here?
Daewon, where is he?

24:06.500 --> 24:07.899
-Okay, my friend.

24:12.450 --> 24:13.906
Do you have warrant?

24:14.910 --> 24:16.150
No?

24:17.370 --> 24:18.496
Bye-bye.

24:30.080 --> 24:32.321
-Excuse me, excuse me!
Excuse...

24:35.830 --> 24:37.616
I-- I can help you.

24:46.250 --> 24:48.946
- Hi, friends.

24:52.200 --> 24:54.031
- Take it easy!
- Let's try this--

24:54.080 --> 24:57.038
-Take it easy!
-Let's try this again! Hmm?
Let's try this again!

24:57.080 --> 25:00.072
Where's Daewon?
Where's Daewon?

25:01.500 --> 25:03.946
-They sent him to Moscow.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.991
They gave him asylum.

25:09.910 --> 25:12.071
He's gone, okay? He's gone.

25:13.200 --> 25:15.327
And you'll never find him.

25:20.160 --> 25:21.536
No,dont.

25:33.750 --> 25:37.789
What they gonna do, huh?
It's cool, little man,
chill. Chill.

25:37.830 --> 25:40.697
Jey's just doin'
what need to be done.

25:45.500 --> 25:47.149
Shit.

25:47.200 --> 25:49.031
This room, huh?

25:55.660 --> 25:57.116
This room, right?

26:01.000 --> 26:03.946
We took over all of Little Haiti
from this damn room right here.

26:06.160 --> 26:07.650
All of Little Haiti.

26:13.330 --> 26:14.615
Seem like lately...

26:15.750 --> 26:17.445
all I been askin' myself...

26:19.040 --> 26:20.826
where'd Big Man Ronnie go?

26:20.870 --> 26:22.110
Hmm?

26:23.250 --> 26:24.535
What happened to him?

26:27.370 --> 26:28.610
You know?

26:28.660 --> 26:30.150
Me and you, right?

26:31.160 --> 26:32.991
Huh?

26:33.000 --> 26:34.991
We started
this whole damn thing, dawg.

26:36.330 --> 26:37.695
We came up, nigga.

26:38.830 --> 26:40.320
Came up.

26:43.160 --> 26:45.321
305.

26:46.410 --> 26:48.150
LH7's old boys.

26:49.660 --> 26:51.150
Me and you, boy.

26:59.200 --> 27:02.283
Now, with you sittin' here...

27:02.330 --> 27:05.493
shit, nigga, really I don't even
recognize you, dawg.

27:07.750 --> 27:11.151
It's crazy how the past flip
things on you like that, right?

27:17.500 --> 27:19.445
I told you gimme that money.

27:20.450 --> 27:21.940
I told you gimme that money.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.195
Where the bread at?
Where the money at?

27:24.290 --> 27:26.155
-You gonna do
what you gonna do, Jey.

27:26.200 --> 27:27.747
But the money ain't gonna come
no sooner,

27:27.790 --> 27:29.781
so you might as well
get this shit done with.

27:29.830 --> 27:31.570
Hmm.

27:39.040 --> 27:41.361
You on some shit, huh, nigga?

27:41.410 --> 27:44.743
You really on some shit.
That's my money, dawg!

27:44.790 --> 27:47.611
It ain't our money.
It ain't ours, dawg.

27:47.660 --> 27:51.403
That's mine.
-Go ahead and kill me, Jey.

27:51.450 --> 27:54.999
Kill me. You ain't gonna get
that money if you do.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.746
-Nigga, give me that flame.

28:28.620 --> 28:29.826
Who wanna go first?

28:30.830 --> 28:31.819
Huh?

28:33.870 --> 28:36.907
Nah, nah, nah, you straight.
You good.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.070
Let's see what these other fools
talkin' about.

28:44.950 --> 28:46.360
Come on, now, open season.

28:48.450 --> 28:49.826
Cook your own meat, dawg.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.490
Let's charbroil this fool.

28:54.330 --> 28:56.821
You about it?
You about it?

29:00.330 --> 29:01.695
Cook your own meat.

29:03.040 --> 29:04.576
Huh?

29:11.000 --> 29:12.865
Don't I take care of y'all?

29:15.950 --> 29:17.531
Don't I take care
of y'all niggas?

29:23.250 --> 29:24.990
You goddamn right I do!

29:27.660 --> 29:29.946
Wasn't for me,

29:30.000 --> 29:32.651

29:32.660 --> 29:35.402
But look where you at, nigga!
Look where you at!

29:35.450 --> 29:37.247
I said look where you at!

29:37.290 --> 29:38.496
It's 'cause of me!

29:46.330 --> 29:48.036
Oh, it's like that, huh?

29:49.250 --> 29:51.150
It's like that.

29:51.200 --> 29:53.691
Huh?
Y'all wanna do me like that?

29:53.750 --> 29:55.741
Bunch of pussies!

29:55.790 --> 29:57.746
Bitch! Nigga!

30:05.410 --> 30:07.037
A'ight. We're gonna do it
like that then.

30:07.120 --> 30:08.860
We gonna do it like that.

30:09.870 --> 30:11.656
Just remember,
you remember this:

30:11.700 --> 30:15.659
You make any money,

30:15.660 --> 30:16.900
'Cause that's my money!

30:16.950 --> 30:20.613
I break you off, nigga!
I break you off!

30:20.660 --> 30:22.150
You remember this.

30:22.160 --> 30:24.321
Without me, there ain't nothin'!

30:28.000 --> 30:30.446
I started that.

30:30.500 --> 30:32.320
That don't exist without me.

30:49.120 --> 30:51.156
...bruh.

30:51.160 --> 30:52.991
That don't exist without me.

31:31.450 --> 31:34.658
-Wait. Damn, Megan.
That's all you could find?

31:34.660 --> 31:37.697
-Well, they were on sale,
and you didn't give me
any money.

31:37.790 --> 31:39.155
-This meeting...

31:41.450 --> 31:43.782
Go-- go get something nice,
some cheese and fruit.

31:43.830 --> 31:46.617
-Oh, this card was declined
last time, remember?

31:48.410 --> 31:50.867
-I'll pay you back. Go.
-Okay.

31:53.080 --> 31:54.866
-Can you give her
your credit card?
-Why?

31:54.910 --> 31:56.320
-To get some cheese,
fruit, and shit.

31:56.370 --> 31:58.406
-He's gonna be here
in five minutes.

31:58.450 --> 32:01.112
All right? We don't wanna
seem desperate. It's fine.

32:01.160 --> 32:02.787
Have you seen Ronald?
-No.

32:02.830 --> 32:04.070
-No?
-Uh-uh.

32:04.160 --> 32:05.400
-I'll just call the guy.

32:05.500 --> 32:06.694
-He's here.

32:07.830 --> 32:08.865
- Who?
- Ronald?

32:08.910 --> 32:10.241
-Alex. He's downstairs.

32:10.330 --> 32:12.150
Um, okay. Just...

32:12.160 --> 32:14.697
greet him, please, and tell him
we'll be ready in three.

32:16.500 --> 32:18.365
-Minutes.
-Thank you.

32:18.450 --> 32:19.826
-No, hours.

32:26.750 --> 32:29.492
- Hey.
- Yeah?

32:29.540 --> 32:32.998
-Listen, just remember,
we're all here because of you.

32:33.040 --> 32:34.940
I'm here because of you,
your vision.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.366
Not your code,
your vision. Okay?

32:37.410 --> 32:40.038
-Okay.
-Great. Okay.

32:45.500 --> 32:47.695
- Okay.

32:49.160 --> 32:50.696
-Let--

32:50.750 --> 32:51.990
--Good.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.820
Put on your game face.

32:53.830 --> 32:56.116
-Jesus Christ.
Take these fuckin'
donuts with you.

32:57.120 --> 32:58.326
Donuts.

32:58.330 --> 32:59.991
Where the fuck
is the chalkboard?

33:28.910 --> 33:31.037
-All right,
that's good, baby. Hey.

33:31.080 --> 33:32.695
I gotta go.

33:32.750 --> 33:35.116
-Where are you going?
-Gotta go to work.

33:35.160 --> 33:38.288
-For Jey? After all that?
-GenCoin.

33:38.330 --> 33:40.537
- GenCoin?
Mm-hmm.

33:40.620 --> 33:42.531
You trippin'. Ronald!

33:42.620 --> 33:44.576
Baby, it's the biggest
investor we can get.

33:44.620 --> 33:46.156
We land this,
all our problem over.

33:46.250 --> 33:48.400
-Yeah, but how
you gonna go in there
lookin' all--

33:48.450 --> 33:50.577
-Baby, I done got left out
of this once before.

33:50.620 --> 33:52.360
I ain't gonna let that shit
happen again.

33:52.410 --> 33:54.617
-Ronnie, you look like
you just stepped out

33:54.660 --> 33:56.321
of a damn boxing ring.

33:58.950 --> 34:01.828
I'm gonna look better
wearing this, though.

34:03.120 --> 34:05.031
-Ain't that right?
-All right, nigga.

34:08.660 --> 34:11.538
- It's very fresh, you know.
- It's raw, it's malleable.

34:11.580 --> 34:14.993
- Yeah. Exactly.
- Yeah. Thank you, Megan.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.116
- Elegant.
- Elegant, yeah.

34:18.700 --> 34:20.110
- Oh!
- Okay, Megan.

34:22.950 --> 34:25.748
- Thank you.
You guys just move in?
Yeah. Yeah, we sure did.

34:25.790 --> 34:29.658
We have the ping-pong set up,
so that was the first order
of busmess.

34:29.750 --> 34:32.446
_ -Mm-hmm.
-But It's coming together fast.

34:32.500 --> 34:34.946
- Yeah, it's coming together.
And you guys
remember Vera?

34:35.000 --> 34:36.285
-Yeah.
-Of course I do.
Good to see you.

34:36.330 --> 34:38.491
-Good to see you
with your clothes on.

34:39.830 --> 34:42.492
-I'm an exhibitionist.
Hey, what can I say?

34:42.540 --> 34:44.906
This is Nico,
our lead engineer.

34:44.950 --> 34:46.497
I think you guys
know each other?
Yeah.

34:46.540 --> 34:48.155
- It's been a while.
- Stanford.

34:48.200 --> 34:50.407
- Some _kind of an alumni
reunion happening.
Yeah, class of...

34:50.500 --> 34:52.365
never graduated.
-Oh, right, yeah.

34:52.410 --> 34:55.493
Well, you know, Nico is the one
that audited your code.

34:55.540 --> 34:57.076
Oh, hmm.

34:57.160 --> 34:58.946
It's not weird?

34:59.000 --> 35:01.821
-Oh, no, no,
it was very impressive,
Izzy, it really was.

35:01.870 --> 35:03.656
-Thank you.

35:03.660 --> 35:06.151
-He called me
at literally 6:00 am,
and he was like,

35:06.160 --> 35:08.242
"It's even better
than she said it was!"

35:08.290 --> 35:10.576
-I did.
-Oh, Arnold Schwarzenegger
voice?

35:10.620 --> 35:13.441
- "Get to the chopper!"
- Mm-hmm. Exactly.

35:13.500 --> 35:14.649
-Thank you.

35:14.750 --> 35:16.490
Uh, yeah.

35:18.080 --> 35:19.786
So, where-- where is Ronald?

35:19.830 --> 35:23.322
-Oh, he's-- he was at a meeting
in Deerfield Beach,

35:23.370 --> 35:26.112
and I guess he really wanted
to take them out to lunch.

35:26.160 --> 35:28.867
I suppose
it's going real well, so we said
we'd hold down the fort.

35:28.910 --> 35:31.697
-He'll make it, or maybe not,
but... I think we got it.

35:31.750 --> 35:33.820
We can approximate
his world view.

35:33.830 --> 35:35.149
-Cool, so...

35:35.160 --> 35:37.401
yeah, uh, GenCoin.

35:37.500 --> 35:39.036
Yes.

35:39.080 --> 35:40.866
Have you given any more
thought to my question?

35:40.950 --> 35:42.360
- Sure have.
- The big "Why?"

35:42.450 --> 35:44.031
- Yeah, sure have.
- Yeah.

35:44.120 --> 35:46.281
- Yeah, I think we both have.
Uh-huh.

35:46.330 --> 35:48.901
-And, Izzy,
why don't you go first?

35:48.950 --> 35:51.157
-Yeah, I'll take it away.

35:51.250 --> 35:54.617
Uh, you know, we both have
our own reasons.

35:54.660 --> 35:57.402
I think that's what
GenCoin's all about,

35:57.450 --> 35:59.498
people anywhere in the world,

35:59.540 --> 36:03.112
any class, any color, you know,

36:03.160 --> 36:06.573
having a fair chance
at accessing money.

36:06.620 --> 36:10.329
I think we're just leveling
the playing field for everyone.

36:10.370 --> 36:14.909
For me, it's more about what
my mom and dad went through.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.695
Uh...

36:16.750 --> 36:19.401
when I was a child, they were
opening a Cuban restaurant.

36:19.500 --> 36:21.320
I mean, my mom's
a crazy good cook.

36:21.330 --> 36:23.036
People all over
the neighborhood,

36:23.120 --> 36:25.031
they would beg her
to come over for dinner.

36:25.120 --> 36:26.656
So she figured,

36:26.660 --> 36:29.697
"Well, hey,
why not start charging
and make it a business?"

36:29.790 --> 36:32.657
-Hmm. I mean, I love me
some home-cooked Cuban food.

36:32.660 --> 36:34.992
- Oh, you try her food.
- You'd wanna kiss her.

36:35.080 --> 36:36.445
-Wow.
-She's—-

36:36.500 --> 36:39.196
she's 60, but she's hot.
She's the hot moms.

36:39.250 --> 36:40.740
Okay, yeah.

36:40.790 --> 36:43.031
No, um...

36:43.080 --> 36:46.322
here's what's up, though. Um...

36:46.370 --> 36:49.328
Being Cuban immigrants,
they had no credit,

36:49.370 --> 36:52.692
so they borrowed money from some
people that they shouldn't have.

36:54.330 --> 36:56.321
They didn't have money
to pay them back.

36:56.330 --> 36:58.241
They sold the restaurant
to the highest bidder

36:58.330 --> 37:00.537
and my parents have been
in debt to them ever since.

37:00.540 --> 37:02.747
My dad wears a neon vest,

37:02.830 --> 37:04.695
works at the docks now,

37:04.790 --> 37:07.657
like a chump,
trying to keep square.

37:07.700 --> 37:09.861
I guess the point I'm trying
to make is that

37:09.950 --> 37:12.942
if GenCoin
would have been around,
none of this would happen.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.491
He could have gotten
a loan directly.

37:16.660 --> 37:19.788
And no corporation or bank
is gonna tell them

37:19.830 --> 37:21.616
what to do with that money.

37:21.660 --> 37:24.652
GenCoin_ takes less than
a 1% Interest rate...

37:25.790 --> 37:28.111
which is unnoticeable.

37:28.160 --> 37:30.867
And my parents would've
still had that restaurant

37:30.910 --> 37:33.242
and they would've still been
in that kitchen cooking.

37:37.750 --> 37:39.866
- Interesting.
-Mmm.

37:39.910 --> 37:43.038
-A nice story.

37:43.080 --> 37:46.322
Nick, uh, what about you?

37:46.330 --> 37:49.618
-Yeah, um, well, for me, uh...

37:49.660 --> 37:53.403
- Your "big why," Nick.
- Actually, here's Ronald.

38:06.580 --> 38:08.036
I'm sorry, uh...

38:08.080 --> 38:10.150
I just got tied up
with some other business.

38:11.620 --> 38:13.190
-That's, uh--

38:13.250 --> 38:15.741
that's okay.
We were just--

38:15.790 --> 38:17.860
Izzy was just--

38:17.910 --> 38:21.152
-We were hearing her answer
to Alex's big question.

38:21.200 --> 38:22.997
Oh, yeah, the "why," right?

38:23.000 --> 38:24.399
The big why.

38:24.500 --> 38:26.320
She tell you
about her folk's diner

38:26.330 --> 38:27.945
and the Cuban mob
and all that?

38:28.000 --> 38:29.649
She tell you that?

38:29.700 --> 38:31.110
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

38:31.160 --> 38:33.116
Did Nick tell you
about his shady old man

38:33.160 --> 38:35.993
laundering money to drug cartels
for the past century?

38:36.080 --> 38:38.651
No, no,
we didn't get into that.

38:38.660 --> 38:40.651
- Y'all didn't get into that?
- No.

38:40.750 --> 38:42.650
How startin' GenCoin's
gonna make him feel better

38:42.660 --> 38:45.538
about what his daddy done did?

38:45.580 --> 38:46.740
No?

38:51.160 --> 38:53.151
Why is everybody so quiet?

38:54.580 --> 38:56.036
Is it 'cause of this?

38:58.830 --> 39:00.149
Or this?

39:01.540 --> 39:03.997
Check this out.
See that?

39:07.830 --> 39:10.116
This the business
that had me tied down...

39:11.950 --> 39:13.281
to a goddamn chair...

39:14.370 --> 39:16.110
with barbed wire...

39:17.410 --> 39:19.241
and then getting worked over.

39:20.250 --> 39:21.649
Do you know why?

39:23.950 --> 39:28.114
'Cause I took all the money
that I had been trusted with--

39:28.160 --> 39:30.822
my entire hood's stash...

39:32.290 --> 39:35.077
and I gave it to this
little girl sitting right here.

39:36.870 --> 39:39.282
Izzy Morales.

39:42.330 --> 39:45.037
That's how much I believe
in GenCoin.

39:47.200 --> 39:49.327
Where you from, Alex?

39:49.330 --> 39:51.821
- Uh, Greenwich.
- Greenwich.

39:51.870 --> 39:55.112
- Connecticut.
Damn,
that's quiet. Safe.

39:55.160 --> 39:56.149
-Yeah.

39:57.500 --> 40:00.242
-Most of the folks
in your world

40:00.290 --> 40:06.240
building the software
that's gonna shape our lives,

40:06.290 --> 40:09.327
most of those people,
such as yourself,

40:09.370 --> 40:12.282
y'all grew up in a bubble,
ain't that right?

40:13.870 --> 40:15.406
-You're not wrong.

40:17.290 --> 40:19.941
-And now you still
in a bubble.

40:21.750 --> 40:23.820
Same shit, different path.

40:23.830 --> 40:25.320
Right?

40:28.000 --> 40:29.035
GenCoin.

40:30.040 --> 40:33.999
For the people, by the people.

40:35.660 --> 40:37.651
You see what I'm sayin'?

40:37.700 --> 40:39.611
Anybody who's living
in the streets,

40:39.660 --> 40:40.991
anybody who knows
what's going down

40:41.000 --> 40:43.286
in the streets here in Miami,

40:43.330 --> 40:47.152
or some messed-up village
in Syria,

40:47.250 --> 40:48.899
or anywhere across the world

40:48.950 --> 40:52.613
where folks is turning
their back on other folks,

40:52.660 --> 40:56.448
you got that
and you got this girl's code.

40:57.580 --> 40:59.366
You got supply,

40:59.410 --> 41:02.322
and you have the demand.

41:02.370 --> 41:06.158
You have the problem,
and you have the solution.

41:07.330 --> 41:10.367
You have the currency
of the future.

41:33.700 --> 41:35.361
Wow.

41:35.410 --> 41:38.322
That... is why.

41:41.870 --> 41:43.531
You scared the shit out of me.

41:45.160 --> 41:47.822
That's GenCoin.

41:47.830 --> 41:50.492
Don't eat that._
We're gonna go to dinner.

41:50.540 --> 41:52.906
- You guys hungry?
- Yeah.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.946
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Let's do it.

41:57.040 --> 42:00.999
Okay. That answers that.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.446
- My life is a constant
entrapment of tunnels

42:03.500 --> 42:06.071
Which tangle and wind
and beguile

42:06.120 --> 42:08.998
And regardless of where
I may tumble or funnel

42:09.080 --> 42:11.901
I wonder what's really
worthwhile

42:22.410 --> 42:25.322
Sometimes _it can seem
like a mercrless dream

42:25.370 --> 42:28.077
And I'm falling
with nothing to hold

42:28.120 --> 42:30.998
Sometimes I get flustered
and beaten and blistered

42:31.000 --> 42:33.070
Abandoned
outside in the cold

42:33.160 --> 42:36.652
But I'm gonna win

42:36.660 --> 42:39.197
I'm gonna try

42:39.290 --> 42:41.827
I'll never lose

42:41.830 --> 42:44.537
I'll never die

42:44.620 --> 42:47.077
You've seen me before

42:47.120 --> 42:49.998
You'll see me again

42:50.000 --> 42:52.616
I'll never give up

42:52.660 --> 42:55.367
I'll never give in

42:55.410 --> 42:57.947
Till I'm bloody
and bruised

42:58.000 --> 43:00.616
Till I've broken my bones

43:00.660 --> 43:03.151
Till I won't be abused

43:03.200 --> 43:05.907
Till I'm laughing alone

43:18.200 --> 43:21.283
It's hard to be charming
and smart and disarming

43:21.330 --> 43:23.537
It's hard to pretend
you're the best

43:23.620 --> 43:26.327
It's hard to fulfill_
everyone's expectations

43:26.330 --> 43:28.321
It's hard to keep up
