BARRY: Previously on
The Flash and Supergirl...

00:04.520 --> 00:05.726
<i>THE FLASH: What just happened to him?</i>

00:05.880 --> 00:08.804
Wally has taken my place
in the Speed Force.

00:08.960 --> 00:10.291
<i>THE FLASH". It's okay. We're going home.</i>

00:10.720 --> 00:12.848
<i>BARRY: What Wally saw,
it's gonna haunt him for a while.</i>

00:13.000 --> 00:14.764
I proposed

00:14.920 --> 00:16.570
because I thought it would save you.

00:16.720 --> 00:17.767
What does that mean?

00:17.920 --> 00:19.570
I think we need some space.

00:19.720 --> 00:22.610
I owe you the truth. My name is Mon-El.
I'm the former Prince of Daxam.

00:22.760 --> 00:24.728
I deserve better than being lied to.

00:24.920 --> 00:26.206
I've been looking for you.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.448
(ENERGY PULSING)

00:30.840 --> 00:31.841

00:35.040 --> 00:37.327
(SINGING "SINGIN' IN THE RAIN")

00:38.640 --> 00:41.211
I told you. Everything's better in song.

00:41.640 --> 00:43.768
When you speak, it's just words,

00:44.120 --> 00:48.364
but when you sing, you open up your soul
and let who you really are shine through.

00:48.800 --> 00:50.404
- Thanks, Mom.
-(KISSES)

00:50.560 --> 00:53.564
- I love you, my beautiful boy.
-I love you, too.

00:54.880 --> 00:56.644
(SINGING CONTINUES)

01:03.880 --> 01:04.881
This?

01:05.519 --> 01:06.681
Again?

01:07.680 --> 01:09.170
What, are you gonna spend
the rest of your life

01:09.320 --> 01:10.526
-sitting around on the couch? Come on.
-No...

01:10.680 --> 01:12.409
You've been doing this for days.
Let's do something.

01:12.560 --> 01:13.891
- Let's go out.
-No, man, I'm sorry. I'm...

01:14.040 --> 01:15.166
I don't feel like going out.

01:15.320 --> 01:18.051
What is it with you
and musicals these days, anyhow?

01:18.200 --> 01:19.690
Everything's better in song.

01:21.600 --> 01:24.001
Listen, dude, I know you've been going
through a tough time

01:24.160 --> 01:26.527
since Iris broke off the engagement,

01:26.680 --> 01:27.727
-orl guess...
-What?

01:27.880 --> 01:29.723
...technically, since you
broke off the engagement.

01:29.880 --> 01:32.042
Whoever broke off the engagement,
it doesn't matter.

01:32.200 --> 01:34.407
I just... I don't know, man. I wanna help.

01:34.600 --> 01:36.011
Nothing you can really do.

01:36.360 --> 01:40.251
Really? I guess I'm just gonna
have to let Mr. Gene Kelly take over

01:40.400 --> 01:42.641
'cause, Lord knows,
I can't do anything about that!

It's H.R.

01:48.600 --> 01:49.681
Yeah.

01:58.080 --> 02:01.368
B.A., someone's coming through.

02:01.520 --> 02:02.851
Could be Gypsy.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.844
- Yeah, could be, or could be--
-(PORTAL SURGING)

02:08.479 --> 02:09.640
Supergirl?

02:10.880 --> 02:11.881
Kara.

02:13.360 --> 02:15.328
- What happened to her?
-We don't know,

02:15.480 --> 02:18.211
but whoever did it has come to this world.

02:25.680 --> 02:26.841
Her vitals are low.

02:27.040 --> 02:29.168
- How long has she been like this?
-A few hours.

02:31.240 --> 02:33.242
Okay, we need to find
whoever did this to Kara

02:33.400 --> 02:36.688
and punch him repeatedly until he
reverses whatever spell he put on her.

02:36.960 --> 02:38.166
And I get to punch him first.

02:38.320 --> 02:39.401
Who are you, exactly?

02:39.760 --> 02:41.967
My name is Mon-El. I'm Kara's...

02:43.200 --> 02:44.201
Ff lend.

02:44.800 --> 02:46.290
(STAMMERS) Her more-than-friend?

02:48.600 --> 02:49.726
We've been kissing a lot.

02:49.880 --> 02:52.042
Oh! She never mentioned
she had a boyfriend.

02:52.200 --> 02:53.690
It's a recent thing, so...

02:54.080 --> 02:55.570
I thought you two broke up.

02:56.400 --> 02:57.447
(MUTTERS)

02:57.640 --> 03:00.644
I tell you what. I know enough not
to mention the breakup between Barry and--

03:02.240 --> 03:03.287
- H.R.
-H.R.: Sorry.

03:03.480 --> 03:04.891
(H.R. CLEARING THROAT)

03:05.080 --> 03:07.367
Look, hey, whatever's going on
between me and Kara,

03:07.520 --> 03:10.091
I cannot leave her like this, okay?
I need to get her back.

03:10.240 --> 03:11.730
We will, I promise.

03:12.720 --> 03:14.449
(SIGHING) So what happened to her?

03:14.600 --> 03:17.444
An alien prisoner escaped our custody.
He did something to her.

03:17.600 --> 03:18.806
Put her in some kind of a coma.

03:18.960 --> 03:21.201
Then he disappeared.
We tracked him here and followed.

03:21.680 --> 03:23.364
Okay, but why would he come to this Earth?

03:23.520 --> 03:25.602
Well, we believe, for you.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.685
- Me, why?
-We don't know.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.046
<i>But his last words before he disappeared</i>

03:29.200 --> 03:31.521
were about finding the fastest man alive.

03:33.160 --> 03:36.050
Okay, well, clearly,
we're talking about a breacher here.

03:36.200 --> 03:39.568
And if there's one thing I can do,
it's find breachers.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.648
So what else can you
tell us about this guy?

03:45.800 --> 03:49.168
Not much. It's like he just
materialized out of thin air.

03:49.320 --> 03:51.163
You mean like this clown just did?

03:55.000 --> 03:56.001
I'm gonna go.

04:00.560 --> 04:01.561
Wallace.

04:03.280 --> 04:05.169
I understand what you've been through.

04:05.320 --> 04:07.721
Stuck in the Speed Force,
the things you saw, I get it.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.724
I also know that sometimes
the old adage is true.

04:10.880 --> 04:13.326
When you get bucked from the horse,
best thing you can do,

04:14.040 --> 04:18.442
get right back on the damn thing
and ride, Wallace. Ride!

04:25.240 --> 04:26.810
Hello, Barry Allen.

04:27.520 --> 04:29.170
- How do you--
-Know your name?

04:29.520 --> 04:33.320
I know a lot of things,
and I can do a lot of things, too.

04:33.480 --> 04:35.005
(EXCLAIMING)

04:35.200 --> 04:37.726
Wally West made it here, too.
This is exciting.

04:38.280 --> 04:41.363
It's good of you to join the party,
Kid Flash. I'm happy to have you.

04:41.520 --> 04:42.521
What do you want with Supergirl?

04:42.840 --> 04:45.207
The same thing that I want
with both of you.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.370
To teach you all a lesson.

04:50.360 --> 04:51.566
(GRUNTING)

04:52.760 --> 04:54.569

04:54.800 --> 04:58.122
Is that all you got, Kid Flash?
I mean, you look a little scared.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.286
And you're too slow.

05:04.280 --> 05:05.611

-Hey!

07:31.520 --> 07:33.841
Barry, it's you. Thank Rao!

07:34.280 --> 07:36.601
- Wait, it's really you, right?
-Yeah, this is me. Yeah.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.046
- Good.
-What is...

07:38.200 --> 07:41.124
- Where the hell are we? What's going on?
-I was hoping you could tell me,

07:41.280 --> 07:43.567
or maybe explain to me
why I just pulled an Audrey Hepburn

07:43.720 --> 07:45.290
and sang at a nightclub.

07:45.480 --> 07:47.403
- Maybe we're dreaming?
-The same dream?

07:47.720 --> 07:50.041
Yeah, that's... What's the last thing
you remember before you got here?

07:50.240 --> 07:51.890
I was at the DEO.

07:52.040 --> 07:55.442
They had just brought in
an alien prisoner. He got loose and...

07:56.040 --> 07:59.044
- It was really weird. He had this red--
-Pocket handkerchief?

07:59.200 --> 08:01.441
- Yes.
-I saw you on my Earth.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.967
You were in a coma.
Your boyfriend brought you to us.

08:04.120 --> 08:05.167
He is not my boyfriend.

08:06.040 --> 08:08.520
(STAMMERS)
He's just a boy who is not my friend.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.290
- He's my nothing.
-Okay.

08:10.880 --> 08:14.168
All right. Well, whoever he is
said that this guy whammied you,

08:14.320 --> 08:16.243
and then he escaped to my Earth.
He showed up at S.T.A.R. Labs.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.164
I went after him to try to get him
to wake you up--

08:18.320 --> 08:19.651
- And then you got whammied.
-Yeah.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.325
- So where are we?
-I don't know.

08:21.520 --> 08:24.922
I mean, it could be a parallel dimension,
or maybe just some elaborate illusion.

08:25.080 --> 08:26.445
We just need to figure a way out.

08:26.600 --> 08:30.002
I guess I could
click my heels together three times?

08:30.280 --> 08:31.930
- Yeah.
-I was kidding.

08:32.280 --> 08:34.089
Okay, all right, well...

08:34.640 --> 08:35.640
Come on, let's...

08:37.559 --> 08:39.562
- You're a really good singer, by the way.
-Hey, thanks.

I put the "Kara" in "karaoke."

-We what now?

I pay you to sing,
not pepper me with questions.

08:59.440 --> 09:00.965
And I hope you got
something better in your songbook

09:01.120 --> 09:02.770
than what you were
belting out up there, blondie.

09:02.920 --> 09:05.651
- Hey! Don't call me "blondie"!
-Now, look, I don't know who you are--

09:05.800 --> 09:07.290
But obviously you're someone
who's quick with a knife.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.960
You'll have to excuse my friend.
He doesn't think before he talks.

09:10.120 --> 09:12.964
Yeah, I had a cousin like that.
I had to slit his throat, too.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.121
Oh...

Grady, get these two set up!

(EXCLAIMS) Who's Winn? The name is Grady.
I tickle the keys around here.

09:30.560 --> 09:32.847
Say, you realize how he got
the nickname "Cutter," don't you?

09:33.000 --> 09:35.082
- No.
-Because he likes to cut people.

09:35.240 --> 09:37.846

I think he's all talk.

-All right.

You see, Grady doesn't know this,
but one day I'm gonna be somebody.

09:52.880 --> 09:56.327
I'm gonna be somebody, and it's gonna
happen right there on that stage.

09:56.480 --> 09:58.687
You'll see. I just need my one shot.

09:59.440 --> 10:02.205
- It's just curiouser and curiouser.
-Yeah.

10:02.400 --> 10:03.845

I should mention.

22:28.480 --> 22:29.811
Our love is forbidden.

22:30.760 --> 22:32.569
This is just like West Side Story.

22:32.720 --> 22:34.210
I was <i>thinking more of Fantasticks,</i> but--

22:34.360 --> 22:35.646
<i>MILLIE: Look, the point is,</i>

22:36.680 --> 22:40.810
we ain't telling nobody nothing,
and neither are you, <i>capisce?</i>

22:41.080 --> 22:42.081
<i>Capisce.</i>

22:42.640 --> 22:44.881
- Can you give us a second?
-Oh, um...

22:45.040 --> 22:46.041
(MURMURS)

22:46.280 --> 22:47.361
- MILLIE: Sure.
-(KARA SIGHS)

22:47.520 --> 22:50.171
Okay, look, he says
we need to follow the script.

22:50.480 --> 22:53.370
We're in a musical, so I think
if we convince them to tell their fathers

22:53.520 --> 22:55.124
that they're in love,
maybe that'll get us out of here.

22:55.280 --> 22:58.807
And back home to being single.

22:58.960 --> 23:01.201
- Yay!
-At least we'll be single together.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.289
Saying that never made anyone feel better.

23:03.480 --> 23:04.481
Debatable.

23:05.120 --> 23:06.690
- Okay, so, look...
-(KARA CLEARS THROAT)

23:06.880 --> 23:08.325
...your fathers aren't perfect, right?

23:08.520 --> 23:10.284
Love isn't perfect.

23:10.440 --> 23:13.649
No, but you can't let
your love for somebody

23:13.800 --> 23:16.485
cause you to be afraid
of what might happen.

23:16.640 --> 23:17.801
You've got to take the good with the bad,

23:18.000 --> 23:19.047
-no matter what.
-Right.

23:19.200 --> 23:23.046
And that includes telling your fathers
how you two feel about each other.

23:27.840 --> 23:28.887
All right, you make a convincing argument.

23:29.040 --> 23:30.041
- You do.
-We'll do it!

23:30.200 --> 23:31.201
MILLIE: We'll tell them about us, right?

23:31.360 --> 23:32.361
<i>TOMMY". Well, we should go now.</i>

23:32.520 --> 23:33.965
- Okay! (GIGGLES)
-Gee, thanks, kid.

23:34.840 --> 23:36.001

23:36.160 --> 23:37.889
-(MILLIE GIGGLES)
-Wow.

23:38.600 --> 23:42.127
Okay. Uh. Convincing people in musicals is

23:43.040 --> 23:44.530
-really easy.
-Yeah.

23:44.840 --> 23:47.047
Let's hope getting out of one
is just as easy.

23:47.800 --> 23:49.768

23:50.440 --> 23:52.363

23:54.840 --> 23:55.887

-MILLIEI Mmm.

23:56.680 --> 23:57.966
DIGSY: Thank God you're safe.

23:58.160 --> 24:00.049
Well, of course I'm safe.

24:01.320 --> 24:04.449
Barry and Kara told me
that you sent them to find me.

24:04.600 --> 24:05.840
We were concerned.

24:06.040 --> 24:08.281
Dads, there's no reason to be concerned.

24:09.240 --> 24:10.401
"Dads"?

24:11.040 --> 24:12.804
- You got a problem with that?
-You got a problem with that?

24:13.040 --> 24:17.045
No. I love musicals, so...

24:17.840 --> 24:18.841
Okay.

24:19.560 --> 24:24.930
Look, Dads, there's something
that I need to tell you.

24:26.840 --> 24:27.841
Hmm?

24:28.320 --> 24:30.607
I'm in love! (GIGGLING)

24:34.360 --> 24:37.250
Who is the, uh... The lucky boy?

24:38.560 --> 24:39.561
Um...

24:43.880 --> 24:45.086
Tommy Moran.

24:45.240 --> 24:47.925
Oh... You mean, Cutter Moran's kid?

24:48.080 --> 24:49.445
Dad, look, we're in love.

24:49.640 --> 24:51.483
- The hell you are.
-He's a hooligan.

24:51.640 --> 24:54.246
- His father's a hooligan. His mother is--
<i>- Hey!</i>

24:54.720 --> 24:55.926
Not in front of the girl.

24:56.400 --> 24:58.050
And you're not loving that boy.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.125
Have you lost your mind?

25:01.520 --> 25:03.648
She is the daughter of my enemy!

25:03.920 --> 25:06.764
Digsy Foss is a dirty rotten scoundrel,

25:06.920 --> 25:08.365
and the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree.

25:08.520 --> 25:11.729
- Dad, if you'd just let me explain--
-There's nothing to explain, Tommy!

25:12.000 --> 25:13.001
(SIGHS)

25:13.280 --> 25:15.362
I knew you were keeping something from me.

25:16.760 --> 25:19.286
I never imagined
it was something like this!

25:19.800 --> 25:21.882
She isn't your little girl anymore.

25:23.120 --> 25:24.406
Well, she isn't.

25:24.640 --> 25:26.688
She's an incredibly brave, strong woman.

25:27.280 --> 25:28.805
One look, and you can see that.

25:29.040 --> 25:30.769
And she wants to be with him.

25:31.440 --> 25:33.408
No matter how scared she was to tell you,

25:33.560 --> 25:35.483
no matter how dangerous it is
to be with him,

25:36.240 --> 25:37.969
all that matters is they're together.

25:39.200 --> 25:42.283
And when you find a love like that,
well, you've got to hold on to it,

25:42.680 --> 25:44.330
no matter who's trying to stop you.

25:46.200 --> 25:47.645
That's clear to me now.

25:48.200 --> 25:50.806
I think you're being
a little tough on your son.

25:50.960 --> 25:52.007
Excuse me?

25:52.160 --> 25:54.401
Well, it's obvious why
he didn't tell you right away.

25:54.560 --> 25:56.449
I mean, look at the way you're reacting.

25:57.120 --> 26:00.841
Maybe if you just listen
and hear his reasons

26:01.000 --> 26:03.731
and try to see things
from his point of view...

26:05.120 --> 26:06.121
Maybe...

26:06.280 --> 26:10.729
Maybe you'd understand
why he didn't tell you before now.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.160
Baby doll, it's just...

26:16.200 --> 26:18.362
You'll never understand
what it means to be a father.

26:18.520 --> 26:21.126
Millie, my darling,
we've always taken care of you.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.930
We just want you to be happy.

Gather up the boys. We're going to war.

- Thanks, Dad.
-Come here.

I was hoping would visit me the most.

29:35.560 --> 29:37.528
Fix them, now.

29:37.680 --> 29:39.762
I'm sorry. I can't.

That's just not how it works.

What do you mean?
You're the one who did this to them.

29:54.960 --> 29:58.407
Yes, but they're the only ones that are
in control of what happens to them now,

29:59.240 --> 30:01.083
as are the two of you.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.609

How much do you love him, Iris?

And, you, Mon-El,
how much do you love her?

30:13.480 --> 30:17.405
So the question is,
is that strong enough to save them?

30:19.320 --> 30:21.607
You want Kara and Barry
back from the world they're in?

-How?

What do we do now? We got...

30:46.360 --> 30:50.081
We got Millie and Tommy to tell
their fathers that they're in love.

30:50.280 --> 30:52.567

in a musical and everything,

30:52.720 --> 30:54.961

34:23.159 --> 34:24.161
Can you stop it?

34:24.320 --> 34:25.650
Not if I don't know why.

34:25.920 --> 34:27.159
Then what are we gonna do?

34:27.320 --> 34:28.321
Um...

34:30.440 --> 34:31.929
We need to go
to whatever world they're in.

34:32.600 --> 34:34.011
How are we gonna do that?

34:34.199 --> 34:38.045
Look, he said, if we loved them enough,
that we could save them wherever they are.

34:39.960 --> 34:41.324
Cisco, you can vibe us there.

34:41.800 --> 34:43.005
I don't think it works that way.

34:43.159 --> 34:45.766
You sent me into the Speed Force.
You sent Barry and Wally into the future.

34:45.920 --> 34:48.366
- You can do this, too.
-What is she talking about?

34:49.000 --> 34:50.809
- What's a vibe?
-CISCO: I'll explain later.

34:50.960 --> 34:53.327
Come on, just grab on to my shoulders.

34:54.360 --> 34:55.964

No.

35:35.920 --> 35:37.729
I'm so sorry I lied to you.

36:32.480 --> 36:34.130
I loved it. That was a hell of a show.

36:34.280 --> 36:37.966
And you two, I guess your love
really was strong enough after all.

36:38.160 --> 36:39.446
(LAUGHS) Beautiful.

36:39.680 --> 36:41.284
Man, how did you get out of the cell?

36:41.560 --> 36:44.848
Cisco, do you really think that cell
is gonnajust, like, hold me?

36:45.640 --> 36:48.246
No, I'm sorry. What's going on?
Why did you do this to us?

36:48.400 --> 36:50.971
I did it because
I believe in the good guys.

36:52.280 --> 36:56.649
I told you when we first met,
it was to teach all of you a lesson.

36:57.920 --> 36:59.649
<i>'Cause I see everything,</i>

37:00.480 --> 37:04.485
and I saw two people
with two broken hearts.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.642
So the lesson was...

37:08.480 --> 37:10.801
Love, Supergirl.

37:11.040 --> 37:14.806
Love is about letting yourself be saved.

37:15.560 --> 37:18.723
It's not just about saving other people,
even if you are superheroes.

37:19.160 --> 37:21.447
Anyway, I'm sorry that I had to, like,
mess with you a little bit.

37:21.600 --> 37:24.604
I was just trying to get you
to play the game, do the song and dance.

37:24.800 --> 37:28.247
Are you from another, uh, Earth,
multi-verse, universe, or something?

37:28.400 --> 37:31.768
(EXHALES) Yeah, you wouldn't even
understand where I come from.

37:31.920 --> 37:32.921
Uh...

37:33.800 --> 37:35.040
Wait. I'm sorry. That's it?

37:35.200 --> 37:37.680
You're just gonna teach
somebody else a lesson?

37:37.840 --> 37:39.444
- Yeah, it's exactly what I'm gonna do.
-Oh.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.731

So let me get this straight.

38:05.440 --> 38:07.841
You got whammied by some guy named...

38:08.000 --> 38:09.047
Music Meister.

38:09.200 --> 38:12.090
Damn, Barr, I'd have paid good money
to see you singing and dancing. (CHUCKLES)

38:12.240 --> 38:13.241
(LAUGHING) No!

38:13.440 --> 38:16.808
Uh. Well, he's holding out on you
because Barry has an amazing voice.

38:16.960 --> 38:18.007
- He does.
-Uh-uh.

38:18.200 --> 38:19.565
I've actually seen him sing.

38:19.720 --> 38:20.721
What, you have?

38:20.880 --> 38:22.848
How have we not made a GIF of that?

38:23.000 --> 38:25.890
Well, technically, I'm not even
the only one here who can sing.

38:26.880 --> 38:27.881
Thank you, B.A.

38:28.040 --> 38:29.087
Well, I was talking about Kara.

38:29.280 --> 38:31.044
(STAMMERS) on. You, too?

38:31.520 --> 38:33.807
Kara. Of course Kara can sing.

38:33.960 --> 38:36.770
Well, her name <i>is</i> Supergirl.
It's kind of implied, right?

38:37.640 --> 38:39.483
-(IRIS LAUGHS)
-Well, we better be getting going.

38:39.640 --> 38:42.007
We promised Kara's sister
we'd get her back in one piece.

38:42.160 --> 38:44.083
We couldn't have done this without you.
Thank you.

38:44.240 --> 38:45.287
Thank you.

38:46.800 --> 38:49.280
- How you guys doing?
-Yeah, I think we'll be okay.

38:49.880 --> 38:53.089
Although, if you lie to me again,
I will drop a mountain on you.

38:53.240 --> 38:54.924
Wow. You mean, figuratively?

38:55.080 --> 38:57.048
- No, I mean, geologically.
-Okay.

38:57.200 --> 38:58.201
(KARA LAUGHS)

38:59.280 --> 39:00.520
What about you guys?

39:02.920 --> 39:04.081
We'll see.

You didn't change anything
when I moved in with Cisco.

I, um, couldn't bring myself to do it.

39:24.600 --> 39:25.601
(EXHALES)

39:25.800 --> 39:29.885
You know, we've been through a lot
these last three years,

39:31.120 --> 39:32.690
but getting stuck in a musical?

39:32.840 --> 39:33.841
- BARRY: Mmm-hmm.
-(LAUGHS)

39:34.000 --> 39:36.810
Music Meister said that, you know,
it could have been anything,

39:36.960 --> 39:39.486
that I created that world because--

39:39.640 --> 39:42.883
You were watching them, because of us.

39:44.360 --> 39:45.646
My mom used to always say

39:45.800 --> 39:48.644
that musicals have the power
to make everything better.
