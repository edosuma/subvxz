.

00:06.474 --> 00:07.241
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:08.609 --> 00:10.044
sexually based offenses

00:10.078 --> 00:11.912
are considered especially
heinous.

00:11.945 --> 00:14.415
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.448 --> 00:16.184
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.217 --> 00:17.718
are members of an elite squad

00:17.751 --> 00:19.753
known as the
Special Victims Unit.

00:19.787 --> 00:21.522
These are their stories.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.626
[upbeat music playing]

00:25.659 --> 00:27.228
- There you go, son--

00:27.261 --> 00:30.231
the genuine Teddy "Brown Sugar"
left hook.

00:30.264 --> 00:31.265
[camera clicks]

00:31.299 --> 00:33.101
[laughing]

00:33.134 --> 00:35.669
Don't forget to pick up
some of my TKO barbecue sauce.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.505
It's bone-sucking good.

00:37.538 --> 00:40.208
- Teddy, hi!

00:40.241 --> 00:41.209
- Crystal!

00:41.242 --> 00:43.511
My favorite Southern belle.

00:43.544 --> 00:44.678
You look lovely as always.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.013
- Thank you.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.081
- And who's this little lady?

00:47.115 --> 00:49.049
- This is my niece, Amber.

00:49.083 --> 00:50.118
Remember I told you about her?

00:50.151 --> 00:51.119
Her momma's been sick.

00:51.152 --> 00:52.420
- Of course.

00:52.453 --> 00:53.754
You didn't tell me
she's a bombshell

00:53.787 --> 00:55.223
like her auntie.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.291
- OMG, it's really you,

00:57.325 --> 00:58.292
Teddy Hawkins.

00:58.326 --> 00:59.293
- In the flesh.

00:59.327 --> 01:00.361
Go ahead, pinch me.

01:00.394 --> 01:01.362
- [laughing]
No.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.131
- Come on, go ahead.

01:03.164 --> 01:04.598
[laughing]

01:04.632 --> 01:05.799
- [gasps]

01:05.833 --> 01:08.369
- Teddy is brazen.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.670
This UC know what she's doing?

01:09.703 --> 01:11.139
I mean, she looks awfully young.

01:11.139 --> 01:13.674
- That's why she's here.
She's still in the Academy.

01:13.707 --> 01:16.610
Rollins prepped her
and primed him.

01:16.644 --> 01:18.246
Carisi, you got eyes?

01:18.279 --> 01:20.448
- Big Teddy's not
wasting any time.

01:20.481 --> 01:23.784
- Iced teas, Long Island style.
- Oh, thank you.

01:23.817 --> 01:25.052
- Do I need ID?

01:25.153 --> 01:26.454
- Not when you're with Teddy.

01:26.487 --> 01:27.488
Drink up.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.056
- Amber, it's fine.

01:29.157 --> 01:30.224
When do you get
the chance to meet

01:30.258 --> 01:32.360
a real life heavyweight champ?

01:32.393 --> 01:33.561
- [laughing]

01:33.594 --> 01:35.663
- Mmm, it's sweet.
I like it.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.631
- I like taking care
of my ladies.

01:37.665 --> 01:39.333
- Well, Amber can use
all the help she can get.

01:39.367 --> 01:41.435
She's had a rough year
this year.

01:41.469 --> 01:43.671
- Are those your
real belts?

01:43.704 --> 01:45.173
- Replicas.

01:45.173 --> 01:47.808
But Teddy can show you
the real ones...

01:47.841 --> 01:49.310
from all four reigns.

01:49.343 --> 01:51.512
- I mean, they're right
downstairs in his office.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.181
- Wow.

01:53.214 --> 01:55.416
Aunt Crystal, can we?

01:55.449 --> 01:57.185
- If Teddy doesn't
mind showing you.

01:57.218 --> 01:58.319
- Not at all.

01:58.352 --> 01:59.453
Come on.

01:59.487 --> 02:01.189
- Go ahead.

02:01.222 --> 02:03.257
- Hey, y'all,
you enjoy yourselves.?

02:03.291 --> 02:05.426
Good deal.
Hey, guys.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.361
- Rollins goes downstairs,
I lose sight of them.

02:07.395 --> 02:09.463
- Ah, after you, my dear.

02:09.497 --> 02:10.464
- Thank you.

02:10.498 --> 02:12.666
- Careful on the stairs.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.368
[chuckles]

02:16.204 --> 02:18.506
- We still have visual
on Rollins' cam.

02:20.708 --> 02:22.710
- No way.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.845
[gasps]

02:24.878 --> 02:26.847
Wow, Mr. Hawkins.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.549
- Call me Teddy, y'hear?

02:29.650 --> 02:31.452
- [whispering]
My God.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.853
Wow.

02:32.886 --> 02:34.355
- [laughing]

02:34.388 --> 02:35.856
- Oh...

02:35.889 --> 02:37.458
- You got the face of an angel

02:37.491 --> 02:38.792
and a body for sin.

02:38.826 --> 02:39.827
- [giggling]

02:39.860 --> 02:42.230
- Come, sit.

02:42.230 --> 02:45.132
How old are you, again?

02:45.233 --> 02:47.235
- Almost 16.

02:47.268 --> 02:49.503
- So young.

02:49.537 --> 02:51.305
You ever think about modeling?

02:51.339 --> 02:52.740
My friend runs an agency.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.608
How about we take
some photos for him?

02:54.642 --> 02:56.244
- That would be amazing.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.478
- All right.

03:02.350 --> 03:04.885
Smile for me.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.254
- [giggling]

03:06.254 --> 03:07.255
[camera clicking]

03:07.255 --> 03:08.789
- That's it.
Beautiful.

03:08.822 --> 03:10.258
- [giggling]

03:10.258 --> 03:11.892
- Now, uh...

03:11.925 --> 03:13.594
stretch a little.

03:16.664 --> 03:19.267
Yeah.
[laughing]

03:19.267 --> 03:21.835
[camera clicking]

03:21.869 --> 03:23.437
So pretty.

03:23.471 --> 03:26.274
- [giggling]

03:26.274 --> 03:27.808
- Maybe...

03:27.841 --> 03:30.844
maybe open that blouse
a little more?

03:33.547 --> 03:35.683
[laughing]

03:35.716 --> 03:38.452
Oh, that's lovely.
[camera shutter clicking]

03:38.486 --> 03:40.821
You got to let Uncle Teddy
see more of those.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.690
- [laughing]

03:42.723 --> 03:44.292
[camera clicks]

03:44.292 --> 03:46.427
- Can you take that top off?

03:48.629 --> 03:51.365
- If that's what Teddy wants.

03:51.399 --> 03:52.466
- [chuckling]

03:57.838 --> 04:00.874
[dramatic music]

04:00.908 --> 04:01.875
*

04:01.909 --> 04:04.345
- [laughing]

04:04.378 --> 04:06.814
- Beautiful.
- Like that?

04:06.847 --> 04:08.749
- Oh, yes.

04:08.782 --> 04:14.822
*

04:14.855 --> 04:16.857
Why don't you turn around
and unhook that thing?

04:16.890 --> 04:24.798
*

04:24.832 --> 04:26.634
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

04:26.667 --> 04:29.403
*

04:29.437 --> 04:31.839
My goodness.

04:31.872 --> 04:34.475
*

04:34.508 --> 04:36.744
Now I'm starting to
get other ideas.

04:36.777 --> 04:41.415
*

04:41.449 --> 04:43.851
Why don't you get on
your knees, little girl?

04:43.884 --> 04:46.019
- NYPD.

04:46.053 --> 04:48.422
Why don't you put your
hands up in the air?

04:48.456 --> 04:49.890
- Hey, now, what is this?

04:49.923 --> 04:50.958
Nothing happened!

04:50.991 --> 04:52.360
- Oh, yeah it did, champ.

04:52.393 --> 04:53.627
- I know my rights.

04:53.661 --> 04:54.695
You can't just burst in here.

04:54.728 --> 04:56.364
- Teddy Hawkins,
you're under arrest

04:56.364 --> 04:57.498
for attempted rape.

04:57.531 --> 05:00.701
- Attempted rape?

05:00.734 --> 05:02.436
- Nice work.

05:02.470 --> 05:03.704
- Yeah.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.606
You stay in this job
long enough,

05:05.639 --> 05:08.442
all your heroes die.

05:08.476 --> 05:12.480
*

05:14.382 --> 05:17.385
[dramatic music]

06:00.528 --> 06:00.661
.

06:01.429 --> 06:02.262
- This is harassment.
Mr. Hawkins was set up.

06:03.431 --> 06:05.032
- I didn't hear him say no.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.300
- Right, because when
this woman approached me

06:07.334 --> 06:08.602
with her foul come-ons,

06:08.636 --> 06:10.504
I decided to gather evidence.

06:10.538 --> 06:11.572
- Is that why you
asked my niece

06:11.605 --> 06:12.906
to get on her knees?

06:12.940 --> 06:14.207
- I wanted to see
how far you'd go

06:14.241 --> 06:16.209
before I made
a citizen's arrest.

06:16.243 --> 06:18.345
- [chortling]

06:20.047 --> 06:21.549
- Who is this exemplary
human being?

06:21.582 --> 06:23.316
- Teddy "Brown Sugar" Hawkins.

06:23.350 --> 06:25.185
He's the former boxing champ.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.654
He's the current face

06:26.687 --> 06:29.256
for all those shopping mall
barbecue joints.

06:29.289 --> 06:30.991
- Does he realize how much
trouble he's in?

06:31.024 --> 06:31.992
- Oh, not yet.

06:32.025 --> 06:32.993
He's been doing it so long,

06:33.026 --> 06:35.362
he thinks he's bulletproof.

06:36.964 --> 06:39.166
- There they are,
my two favorite people,

06:39.199 --> 06:40.668
and with good news
for a change.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.269
- Deputy Commissioner Abraham,

06:42.302 --> 06:43.937
word travels fast.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.673
- You got him on
attempted rape.

06:45.706 --> 06:48.041
What else?
What about child porn?

06:48.075 --> 06:50.043
- TARU tossed his
home computers.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.979
That's clean,
but they did find

06:52.012 --> 06:54.047
some bad sites on his
restaurant servers.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.083
But we can't prove
that he accessed them.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.851
- Still, he's a big get.

06:57.885 --> 07:00.087
One-P-P wants him schlonged--

07:00.120 --> 07:01.489
perp-walked, cuffed,

07:01.489 --> 07:03.991
his punim on every
cable news show in the country.

07:06.226 --> 07:07.628
Well done, Lieutenant.

07:09.997 --> 07:12.533
- An attaboy from Hank Abraham.

07:12.566 --> 07:14.502
- Cue the Apocalypse.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.105
- She told you
she wasn't even 16,

07:18.138 --> 07:19.372
and you still
took photos of her

07:19.406 --> 07:20.608
without her top on.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.009
- That's child pornography.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.244
- That Amber--
- That Amber is no child.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.946
- This is straight up
entrapment.

07:25.979 --> 07:27.114
- We entrapped you?

07:27.147 --> 07:28.381
Good luck with that.

07:28.415 --> 07:30.283
Might want to get your
client camera ready.

07:30.317 --> 07:31.719
It's time for your perp walk.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.186
- Slow it down, Lieutenant.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.589
Perp walk?
- NYPD needs a win.

07:35.623 --> 07:37.625
Teddy, you're about
to trend worldwide.

07:37.658 --> 07:40.360
Front entrance.
Press is en route.

07:40.393 --> 07:42.896
- Hang on a minute there,
sweetheart.

07:44.732 --> 07:48.401
[murmuring]

07:48.435 --> 07:51.204
- All right.

07:51.238 --> 07:52.573
- You got Teddy all wrong.

07:52.606 --> 07:53.574
- Do I?

07:53.607 --> 07:55.408
- Teddy's a hero.

07:55.442 --> 07:57.611
And I'm gonna get you
the real bad guys.

07:57.645 --> 07:59.947
- My client is
prepared to expose

07:59.980 --> 08:01.615
an online pedophile ring.

08:01.649 --> 08:02.616
Okay?

08:02.650 --> 08:04.051
So tell Barba to stop

08:04.084 --> 08:05.418
admiring himself in that glass

08:05.452 --> 08:07.254
and come in and do his job.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.391
- Excuse me, Naomi.

08:11.424 --> 08:14.294
Can you give me a minute with
my handsome, single son?

08:14.327 --> 08:16.564
- I'll be back.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.398
- You're on leave,
and you couldn't find the time

08:18.431 --> 08:20.568
to return your old man's calls?

08:20.568 --> 08:22.469
- I'm doing better, Dad.
How are you?

08:22.570 --> 08:24.104
- Just had breakfast
with the head of

08:24.137 --> 08:25.639
the Joint Terrorism Task Force.

08:25.673 --> 08:27.374
- Are you thinking about
switching gigs?

08:27.407 --> 08:28.709
- Not me.

08:28.742 --> 08:33.413
You--the whole department knows
about your heroics upstate.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.718
- Heroics?

08:37.751 --> 08:39.587
I got shot.

08:39.587 --> 08:41.589
- In the line of duty.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.156
Word is you took a bullet

08:43.190 --> 08:45.225
for the rogue female detective
from Chicago.

08:45.258 --> 08:46.594
- Yeah, and who's
spreading that word?

08:46.594 --> 08:47.661
- Never mind that.

08:47.695 --> 08:48.796
This is your ticket--

08:48.829 --> 08:49.797
up and out.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.498
- Out?

08:51.599 --> 08:53.033
I just got to SVU.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.167
- It was always just
a stepping stone.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.970
Part of the five-year plan.

08:57.004 --> 08:58.639
You want your lieutenant's bars,

08:58.672 --> 09:01.241
go JTTF.

09:01.274 --> 09:02.910
That's where the juice is now.

09:02.943 --> 09:04.712
- I'm just getting comfortable.

09:06.614 --> 09:09.116
- Never get comfortable.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.618
Soon as your shoulder's better,

09:10.651 --> 09:12.085
back on the ladder.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.321
- Teddy wants to do
the right thing.

09:14.354 --> 09:15.388
- Uh-huh.

09:15.422 --> 09:17.157
- People offer me videos
all the time.

09:17.190 --> 09:18.826
I can help you take
those guys down.

09:18.859 --> 09:20.761
- Now, my client doesn't
view this material.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.129
He just knows people who do.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.264
- You're saying your client
doesn't download

09:24.297 --> 09:26.533
child pornography,
yet the people who do so

09:26.634 --> 09:27.701
trust him implicitly?

09:27.735 --> 09:28.802
- Exactly right.

09:28.836 --> 09:30.470
And since you have less
than a flawless case--

09:30.503 --> 09:31.705
- Really?

09:31.739 --> 09:34.642
- Undercovers drinking,
stripping their clothes off?

09:34.675 --> 09:37.110
The smart move is go after
the real creeps,

09:37.144 --> 09:39.446
the distributors,
in the act of uploading.

09:39.479 --> 09:41.314
- [sighs]

09:41.348 --> 09:43.651
The charges aren't going away,
Mr. Hawkins.

09:43.651 --> 09:45.786
But the more you cooperate,

09:45.819 --> 09:47.855
the more generous I'll be

09:47.888 --> 09:49.456
with my sentencing
recommendation.

09:49.489 --> 09:51.191
- And you need to hold off
on the arraignment.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.160
It's better if the people
he's reaching out to

09:53.193 --> 09:54.361
don't know he's been arrested.

09:54.394 --> 09:55.663
- Also, these guys--

09:55.696 --> 09:56.864
not that I'm in touch
with them--

09:56.897 --> 09:59.366
but they don't post
the new, juicy stuff

09:59.399 --> 10:01.401
till after midnight.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.137
- NYPD!
Hands in the air!

10:04.171 --> 10:05.338
- Whoa, what's going on?
- Get up, get up!

10:05.372 --> 10:07.540
Turn around.

10:14.381 --> 10:16.183
- NYPD?
You can't just--

10:16.216 --> 10:17.550
- Shut up.

10:17.584 --> 10:21.855

10:21.889 --> 10:23.256
- Aw, jeez.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.893
*

10:25.926 --> 10:29.329
No, not good.

10:29.362 --> 10:31.498
- Pullman's in custody,
crying like a bitch.

10:31.531 --> 10:33.767
- Okay, that is
two out of three.

10:33.801 --> 10:37.170
- Okay, uh, Rollins,
Carisi's on his way to you.

10:37.204 --> 10:38.405
- Should've saved him the trip.

10:38.438 --> 10:39.807
It's almost 1:00 a.m.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.309
Maybe "Babybanger" took
the night off, huh?

10:42.342 --> 10:44.577
- Eh, he's 80.
He's probably asleep.

10:44.611 --> 10:46.246
- Nothing yet?

10:46.279 --> 10:47.447
Maybe he got spooked.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.516
Listen, Lieutenant, it's late.
It's cold.

10:49.549 --> 10:50.684
Maybe we should just
call it a night.

10:50.718 --> 10:51.685
- I hear you.

10:51.719 --> 10:53.220
Look, we already got two.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.222
So let's, uh, let's start again
in the morning.

10:55.255 --> 10:56.256
- Oh, hold up.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.191
Hold up.

10:58.225 --> 11:00.493
Look at that,
he just logged on.

11:00.527 --> 11:02.195
- Bad luck for him.

11:02.229 --> 11:04.932
Another minute, we would've
been out of here.

11:04.965 --> 11:11.805
*

11:11.839 --> 11:13.941
- NYPD.
Where's your computer?

11:13.974 --> 11:15.575
- I don't have a computer.

11:15.608 --> 11:17.244
- We have a search warrant.

11:17.277 --> 11:19.412
- Warrant?
For what?

11:19.446 --> 11:22.449
- For distributing
child pornography

11:22.482 --> 11:24.651
from your IP address.

11:24.752 --> 11:26.486
- IP?
What--what is this?

11:26.519 --> 11:27.487
- Kitchen's clear.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.789
No desktop, no laptop.

11:28.822 --> 11:31.458
- Mr. Markowicz,
where's your modem?

11:31.491 --> 11:32.760
- My who?

11:32.793 --> 11:34.394
- Your--your modem.

11:34.427 --> 11:35.863
- Hey.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.630
Hey.

11:37.664 --> 11:39.299
This right here, Mr. Markowicz.

11:39.332 --> 11:40.633
Where's the computer for this?
- That?

11:40.667 --> 11:42.770
My neighbor put that in
for my cable.

11:42.770 --> 11:44.671
- Your neighbor, huh?

11:44.772 --> 11:46.907
This has the signal
going next door.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.208
- Who lives there?

11:48.241 --> 11:49.676
- A nice family.
Two kids.

11:49.777 --> 11:55.515
*

11:55.548 --> 11:56.784
- Detectives?

11:56.817 --> 11:58.185
I thought I heard something.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.153
Is Mr. Markowicz okay?

12:00.187 --> 12:01.621
- Counselor...

12:01.654 --> 12:03.423
uh...

12:03.456 --> 12:04.792
can we come in?

12:04.792 --> 12:05.959
Our cells are down.

12:05.993 --> 12:09.396
You don't happen to have
a computer we could use?

12:09.429 --> 12:10.597
- Yeah, of course.

12:10.630 --> 12:12.499
Um, my husbands still up.

12:12.532 --> 12:13.700
He's in his office.

12:13.801 --> 12:14.701
I'm sure he won't mind.

12:14.802 --> 12:18.338
*

12:18.371 --> 12:19.807
- He has his own home office?

12:19.807 --> 12:20.908
- Needs it.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.675
You know him, always working.

12:22.709 --> 12:26.613
- This is a police matter.

12:26.646 --> 12:28.816
- Deputy Commissioner Abraham--

12:28.816 --> 12:29.950
- What are you doing here?

12:29.983 --> 12:31.451
- We're about to ask you
the same question.

12:31.484 --> 12:32.685
Step away from the computer.

12:32.719 --> 12:34.587
Now.

12:48.936 --> 12:49.069
.

12:54.274 --> 12:54.975
- Thanks, Lieutenant.
See you soon.

12:56.910 --> 12:58.345
- What's going on?

12:58.378 --> 12:59.446
- It's nothing, Pippa.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.081
It's departmental business.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.616
Just stay out of this.

13:07.020 --> 13:09.890
I'm assuming Lieutenant Benson
told you to walk out of here.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.624
- Actually, she's on her way.

13:11.658 --> 13:14.127
- For an innocent mistake?
I clicked too many buttons.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.462
- We caught you

13:15.495 --> 13:17.730
in the act of distributing
child pornography.

13:17.764 --> 13:20.133
- I have a secure modem
from the NYPD.

13:20.167 --> 13:22.602
- Which is why you cadged wi-fi
from your 80-year-old neighbor.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.271
- Oh, this gets crazier
and crazier.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.472
- You know what?

13:25.505 --> 13:27.074
I'm gonna go outside
and wait for Liv.

13:27.107 --> 13:29.877
- Look...

13:29.877 --> 13:31.144
I don't want to put
the two of you

13:31.178 --> 13:32.345
in a bad position.

13:32.379 --> 13:33.513
I know you're just
the messengers,

13:33.546 --> 13:36.716
but this could go wrong
in a lot of ways.

13:36.749 --> 13:39.920
- I hope that's not a threat,
Deputy Commissioner.

13:42.255 --> 13:43.623
- Sergeant.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.692
Sergeant, turn off
those lights, please.

13:45.725 --> 13:47.794
- So I was halfway home
when I got Rollins' call.

13:47.895 --> 13:49.462
I figured you could
use some backup.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.431
- Thanks.
They're still in the apartment.

13:51.464 --> 13:53.400
- Computer crimes here yet?
- Almost.

13:53.433 --> 13:56.636
Gives me time to get Pippa
and the kids out.

13:56.669 --> 14:00.040
- Lieutenant.

14:00.073 --> 14:01.341
I know you live to make
my life miserable,

14:01.374 --> 14:03.643
but J.C., Mary, and Joseph--
this?

14:03.676 --> 14:05.278
- Look, you didn't have
to wake the commissioner up

14:05.312 --> 14:06.213
in the middle of the night
to tell him

14:06.246 --> 14:08.115
that his trusted PR chief

14:08.148 --> 14:10.217
is busted for child porn.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.218
- Between you and me,

14:11.251 --> 14:12.285
I never liked the guy anyway.

14:12.319 --> 14:13.520
- No one does.

14:13.553 --> 14:14.721
He's an angry prick.

14:14.754 --> 14:16.123
- But you're sure it's him?

14:16.156 --> 14:17.557
- My squad knows
what they're doing.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.092
- His wife is that
redheaded D.A.?

14:19.126 --> 14:20.227
- Pippa Cox.

14:20.260 --> 14:21.494
She's a lawyer for
social services.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.096
She protects kids.

14:23.130 --> 14:25.198
- This keeps getting worse.
- Oh, yes it does.

14:25.232 --> 14:26.299
They have two of their own.

14:26.333 --> 14:27.534
- Rollins, we're sure, right?

14:27.567 --> 14:29.302
Every I dotted,
every T crossed?

14:29.336 --> 14:31.271
- We tracked the wi-fi
to his computer.

14:31.304 --> 14:32.805
We caught him actively
uploading.

14:32.839 --> 14:35.075
We took a digital snapshot
of his entire system.

14:35.108 --> 14:37.144
I mean,
everything was by the book.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.245
- I'm sure it was.
It's just that--

14:38.278 --> 14:39.546
- Look, Tucker just
wants to make sure

14:39.579 --> 14:41.014
that we hand IAB
an airtight case.

14:41.048 --> 14:42.182
- Yeah.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.383
- If he wasn't
your initial target,

14:43.416 --> 14:44.617
you're gonna need
an updated warrant.

14:44.651 --> 14:46.019
- Almost here.

14:46.053 --> 14:47.187
In the meantime,

14:47.220 --> 14:48.388
bring Abraham in?

14:48.421 --> 14:49.622
- Yeah, just...

14:49.656 --> 14:51.324
don't cuff him in front
of his family.

14:51.358 --> 14:53.693
- And get him out of here
before the press show up.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.264
- What are you people doing?

14:57.297 --> 14:59.399
Squad cars in front of my
building, police lights on?

14:59.432 --> 15:00.700
I'm chairman of the co-op.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.802
- We are taking you
into the station, Hank.

15:02.835 --> 15:04.171
- Turn around, please.

15:04.204 --> 15:07.607
- Lieutenant said we
don't have to do that.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.977
- I wouldn't count on
too many more favors.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.581
- Whenever you're ready.

15:14.614 --> 15:16.283
- It's okay, sweetheart.

15:16.316 --> 15:19.186
Hank.

15:19.219 --> 15:21.488
What is going on?
Talk to me.

15:21.521 --> 15:22.822
- It's a misunderstanding.

15:22.855 --> 15:24.557
Just keep calling
Roger Kressler.

15:24.591 --> 15:25.592
I've left messages.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.227
And tell him to
meet me at SVU.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.196
- Dad, where are you going?

15:29.229 --> 15:30.430
- Police business, Jordy.

15:30.463 --> 15:31.698
It's gonna be all right.
Don't worry.

15:31.731 --> 15:34.701
- Sorry, folks, we've got
to get going, all right?

15:34.734 --> 15:35.702
Come on.

15:35.735 --> 15:37.904
- Why do you have to go, Daddy?

15:38.005 --> 15:41.141
- Oh...
- It's okay, baby, come on.

15:41.174 --> 15:42.775
- All right, come on.
- Come here, okay?

to do it like this

15:57.557 --> 15:59.692
- Just following protocol, Hank.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.561
- Tucker,

16:01.594 --> 16:02.729
who called IAB?

16:02.762 --> 16:04.231
- You're not a cop, thank God,

16:04.264 --> 16:06.266
but you're still
a departmental employee.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.401
- Yeah, with a hell of a lot
more juice than you.

16:08.435 --> 16:10.270

take the deputy commissioner

16:10.303 --> 16:11.271
down now, please.

Just give me five minutes.

Nothing like that.

gonna be okay.

No one will give me
a straight answer.

your apartment.

- What?

16:37.797 --> 16:39.366
This is impossible.

16:39.399 --> 16:41.201
- It's actually not
impossible.

CCS is outside,

their search now.

help you with a hotel.

your kids dressed,

17:45.998 --> 17:48.268
- Liv, dog found something.

17:48.301 --> 17:53.273
*

17:53.306 --> 17:54.274
- You rolling?

17:54.307 --> 17:56.543
Go ahead.

17:56.576 --> 18:04.651
*

18:09.656 --> 18:10.890
- We got flash drives.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.859
- Taped on the bottom
of the underwear drawer.

18:12.892 --> 18:14.627
- And those aren't
vacation photos.

18:14.661 --> 18:15.895
- Separate Faraday bags.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.564
Make sure every procedure
is by the book.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.332
I want a clear chain
of custody on this.

18:19.366 --> 18:20.667
- You got it.

18:27.340 --> 18:27.474
.

18:28.708 --> 18:29.576
- His lawyer, Kressler,
got here at 6:00 a.m.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.612
He's been in there
for over an hour.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.714
- I don't know what
their strategy is.

18:34.747 --> 18:36.949
CCS processed the flash drives.

18:36.983 --> 18:39.452
Hardcore pornographic
images, videos.

18:39.486 --> 18:42.422
Girls, boys--
all pre-pubescent.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.557
- Uh, I don't even
know what to say.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.193
- We get the images
to NCMEC?

18:46.193 --> 18:47.494
- They're running
facial recognition.

18:47.527 --> 18:49.262
- Just so I'm clear, in addition
to these flash drives,

18:49.296 --> 18:50.397
he was also cadging
a wi-fi signal

18:50.430 --> 18:51.698
from the old man next door?

18:51.731 --> 18:54.467
- Rollins and Cirisi entered
Hank Abraham's den

18:54.501 --> 18:57.670
and caught him file-sharing
at his laptop.

18:57.704 --> 18:58.938
- Who else had access
to the den?

18:58.971 --> 19:00.840
- His wife, their two kids.

19:00.873 --> 19:03.510
He has a daughter,
Lia, who's four,

19:03.543 --> 19:05.345
and a son, Jordan, who's 11.

19:05.378 --> 19:07.447
- What about a cleaning lady,
sitter--anyone?

19:07.480 --> 19:09.015
- We dusted his computer
for prints.

19:09.048 --> 19:11.518
Hank Abraham's were
the only ones on it.

19:11.551 --> 19:15.322
- And the password he used for
the Cradlerobberz chat room?

19:15.355 --> 19:18.225
Same one he uses
for the NYPD server.

19:20.893 --> 19:21.894
- Where's his family?

19:21.928 --> 19:23.129
- They spent the night
at a hotel.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.731
We had unis monitoring them.

19:24.764 --> 19:28.000
Pippa's on her way here now with
those kids for their interview.

19:28.034 --> 19:30.937
- She's corporation counsel
for children family services,

19:30.970 --> 19:33.673
and her job is to
protect abused children,

19:33.706 --> 19:34.741
and she had no idea?

19:34.774 --> 19:36.709
- I really don't think so.

19:36.743 --> 19:40.046
She walked Rollins and Carisi
straight into that den

19:40.079 --> 19:41.781
when he was online.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.850
[knocking, opening door]

19:43.883 --> 19:46.753
- Abraham's lawyer
says they're ready.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.020
- [sighs]

19:52.124 --> 19:53.560
One of you want to join me,

19:53.593 --> 19:55.695
or am I on my own?

19:57.930 --> 20:00.667
Hank, what in God's name--
- Yeah, it's not what you think.

20:00.700 --> 20:01.901
- Uh, Hank, Hank--

20:01.934 --> 20:03.503
let me be very clear,
gentlemen.

20:03.536 --> 20:06.038
The deputy commissioner does not
have to speak to you,

20:06.072 --> 20:08.140
so not only is he here
as a courtesy,

20:08.174 --> 20:10.109
but he's also here to sense

20:10.142 --> 20:11.978
what it is you think
is going on.

20:12.011 --> 20:13.446
- We're pretty clear
on what's going on.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.515
- Yeah, so am I.
This is a political takedown.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.650
Barba and the D.A.'s office

20:17.684 --> 20:18.751
are trying to get
their pound of flesh!

20:18.785 --> 20:19.852
- Now, just--
- Whoa!

20:19.886 --> 20:21.888
I'm trying to get
up to speed on this.

20:21.921 --> 20:24.624
Can you walk me through
how and why

20:24.657 --> 20:27.126
you burst through
the deputy commissioner's door

20:27.159 --> 20:29.562
in the middle of the night
without a warrant?

20:29.596 --> 20:31.097
[knocking on door]
- I assure you everything went

20:31.130 --> 20:32.399
through the appropriate
channels.

20:32.432 --> 20:35.101
- Pippa's here with
Jordan and Lia.

20:35.134 --> 20:37.036
- [sighs]
- Where do you want them?

20:37.069 --> 20:38.571
- Uh, put them in interview.

20:38.605 --> 20:39.972
I just want to keep them
away from this.

20:40.006 --> 20:41.140
- Yeah.

20:41.173 --> 20:42.141
[door opens]

20:42.174 --> 20:43.843
- Pippa...

20:45.177 --> 20:48.014
Did you kids get any sleep?

20:48.047 --> 20:50.583
- You mean after you
kicked them out of their home

20:50.617 --> 20:52.919
at 2:00 in the morning?

20:52.952 --> 20:54.086
What is this?

20:54.120 --> 20:56.623
Tea and sympathy?

20:56.656 --> 20:57.957
Softening up the victim--

20:57.990 --> 20:59.426
or the suspect?

20:59.459 --> 21:00.727
- You're not a suspect.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.094
- Then why am I here

21:02.128 --> 21:03.963
with my children?

21:03.996 --> 21:05.365
- You know the protocol.

21:05.398 --> 21:06.633
When--

21:06.666 --> 21:10.870
when a father is facing
these kind of charges--

21:10.903 --> 21:12.839
caught with this kind
of evidence--

21:12.872 --> 21:13.873
- [scoffs]

21:13.906 --> 21:15.875
You know how many people
are in and out

21:15.908 --> 21:17.977
of our apartment--
Hank's den?

21:18.010 --> 21:20.680
Housekeepers, maintenance guys,

21:20.713 --> 21:21.948
deliverymen--

21:21.981 --> 21:24.050
or people from Hank's office.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.918
Uh, we've been having work done.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.987
- Okay.

21:28.020 --> 21:30.490
Then we will be looking
into all of that.

21:30.523 --> 21:32.525
- And you know Hank
makes enemies.

21:32.559 --> 21:34.160
How hard would it be for someone

21:34.193 --> 21:37.430
to hack into
his system remotely?

21:37.464 --> 21:38.631
- How many colleagues
do you think are

21:38.665 --> 21:40.099
dancing on my grave right now?

21:40.132 --> 21:41.901
- No one's doing that.
- Oh, please.

21:41.934 --> 21:44.136
- Let's take a step back from
what you think you have.

21:44.170 --> 21:47.139
It was a neighbor's modem
that uploaded these images.

21:47.173 --> 21:49.108
There's 100 explanations

21:49.141 --> 21:51.544
for how those signals
can get crossed.

21:51.578 --> 21:54.180
- My modem was down.

21:54.213 --> 21:56.783
I might have tried his
by mistake.

21:58.551 --> 22:00.653
- Go on.

22:00.687 --> 22:02.088
- It was late.

22:02.121 --> 22:03.856
I was tired.

22:03.890 --> 22:06.258
An image popped up,
and I tried to close it.

22:06.292 --> 22:08.728
Then all these other images
started popping up.

22:08.761 --> 22:11.230
I couldn't close any of them.

22:11.263 --> 22:13.733
And that must have sent me
into a wormhole.

22:13.766 --> 22:16.002
- And that's when
the detectives burst in.

22:16.035 --> 22:17.737
- So this only happened
one time?

22:17.770 --> 22:18.838
- Yes.

22:18.871 --> 22:20.573
- Let's call this
what it is, gentlemen.

22:20.607 --> 22:22.775
It's a one-time mistake for
which the deputy commissioner

22:22.809 --> 22:24.076
is extremely embarrassed.

22:24.110 --> 22:25.077
You have his word.

22:25.111 --> 22:27.013
It'll never happen again.

22:27.046 --> 22:30.049
No reason to persecute
a good man.

22:31.584 --> 22:34.253
- A good man.

22:34.286 --> 22:35.855
Thing is,

22:35.888 --> 22:38.224
CCS tracked usage on
the same account,

22:38.257 --> 22:41.794
same username and password,
the night before.

22:41.828 --> 22:43.963
Over an hour.

22:43.996 --> 22:45.965
19 hours in the past week.

22:45.998 --> 22:48.968
[dramatic music]

22:49.001 --> 22:51.538
- I don't know
anything about that.

22:51.571 --> 22:53.606
Maybe that was someone else

22:53.640 --> 22:55.975
in the building
going through my wi-fi.

22:56.008 --> 22:58.611
- Do you have any explanation
for the flash drives we found

22:58.645 --> 23:00.547
taped on the bottom
of your underwear drawer,

23:00.580 --> 23:03.349
each containing thousands
of images and videos

23:03.450 --> 23:05.351
of child pornography?

23:05.452 --> 23:09.689
*

23:09.722 --> 23:11.858
Counselor,

23:11.891 --> 23:14.727
do you need a little more
time with your client?

23:14.761 --> 23:20.733
*

23:20.767 --> 23:22.902
- Pippa, we have
enough evidence

23:22.935 --> 23:27.139
to make the possession
and distribution charges stick.

23:27.173 --> 23:28.808
Believe me.

23:28.841 --> 23:32.979
*

23:33.012 --> 23:34.681
- My husband is not a criminal.

23:34.714 --> 23:36.916
And I have nothing more
to say to you.

23:36.949 --> 23:37.917
- That's your right,
but we do need

23:37.950 --> 23:39.986
to speak with your children.

23:40.019 --> 23:41.053
- Not without me present.

23:41.087 --> 23:44.090
- You know the rules.

23:44.123 --> 23:45.858
- Hank is a good father.

23:45.892 --> 23:48.561
- Is he?

23:48.595 --> 23:52.565
- He would never do anything
to hurt Jordan or Lia.

23:52.599 --> 23:54.634
- There's a lot that
you may not...

23:54.667 --> 23:57.637
be aware of.

23:57.670 --> 23:59.839
What if, God forbid,
there was something

23:59.872 --> 24:01.808
that your children
weren't telling you?

24:01.841 --> 24:02.942
- There isn't.

24:02.975 --> 24:04.511
- But you know
better than anyone

24:04.544 --> 24:05.512
that if there was,

24:05.545 --> 24:08.715
they wouldn't say it
in front of you.

24:08.748 --> 24:11.718
So let us do our jobs.

24:11.751 --> 24:14.787
I need to be sure
that you're right.

24:14.821 --> 24:18.424
*

24:18.525 --> 24:20.092
And so do you.

24:20.126 --> 24:24.864
*

24:24.897 --> 24:27.734
- As their mother
and their lawyer,

24:27.767 --> 24:30.369
I watch through the glass.

24:30.402 --> 24:32.739
- Okay.

24:32.772 --> 24:33.973
- Really?

24:34.006 --> 24:35.542
How big is he?

24:35.542 --> 24:37.544
- Real big.
- Yeah?

24:39.746 --> 24:42.549
Lia, you know the difference
between what's true

24:42.582 --> 24:43.816
and what's not true?

24:43.850 --> 24:47.286
- Yes, not true's when
you make up a pretend story.

24:47.319 --> 24:49.321
- That's exactly right.

24:49.355 --> 24:51.758
So I'm gonna ask you some
questions about your family,

24:51.791 --> 24:55.427
and you're gonna tell me
what's true, okay?

24:55.461 --> 24:59.666
Like, your mom, your dad,
your older brother--

24:59.699 --> 25:02.468
do they ever do anything that...

25:02.569 --> 25:03.836
you don't like?

25:03.870 --> 25:07.439
- Sometimes Jordan doesn't
let me play with him.

25:07.473 --> 25:09.776
- Well, that's not very nice.

25:09.809 --> 25:12.812
Older brothers can be
like that though, huh?

25:13.980 --> 25:15.615
Anyone else?

25:15.648 --> 25:18.384
- My dad, sometimes.

25:19.952 --> 25:22.054
- What does he do
that you don't like?

25:22.088 --> 25:24.891
- One time, we were
sitting on the couch.

25:24.924 --> 25:26.793
He was gonna read me a story,

25:26.826 --> 25:28.494
but then...

25:30.597 --> 25:31.931
- Then what happened?

25:31.964 --> 25:34.967
- He fell asleep
and he was snoring.

25:39.939 --> 25:42.742
- Lucas Duda.
Hey, that's his rookie card.

25:42.775 --> 25:43.843
That's nice.

25:43.876 --> 25:46.613
- Yeah, my dad
got it for me.

25:46.613 --> 25:48.781
- Your dad got it
for you, huh?

25:48.815 --> 25:51.117
So about your dad, um...

25:51.150 --> 25:52.619
Do you know why you're here?

25:52.619 --> 25:54.453
- He says it's police business.

25:54.486 --> 25:57.356
At NYPD, it's really 24/7.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.692
- It is.

25:59.726 --> 26:01.928
Well, I got--
I got some questions for you.

26:01.961 --> 26:04.631
Is that okay?

26:04.664 --> 26:06.666
Jordan, has anybody
ever talked to you

26:06.699 --> 26:10.637
about the difference between
good touching and bad touching?

26:10.670 --> 26:13.806
- Stranger danger?

26:13.840 --> 26:15.742
Yeah.

26:15.775 --> 26:19.545
- Has anybody ever
touched you in, um...

26:19.646 --> 26:21.413
well, a private place,

26:21.447 --> 26:23.482
and then told you not
to talk about it?

26:23.515 --> 26:24.651
- No.

26:24.651 --> 26:25.885
- This could be a teacher.

26:25.918 --> 26:26.986
It could be a family friend.

26:27.019 --> 26:28.855
- No, no one.

26:28.888 --> 26:31.157
- It could even be your dad.

26:31.190 --> 26:32.659
It's okay.

26:32.659 --> 26:34.794
It's okay, you can tell me.

26:35.828 --> 26:38.698
- There is something
that he does.

26:38.731 --> 26:40.867
Really bothers me.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.735
[sighs]

26:42.769 --> 26:45.104
I wish he didn't
have to work so much.

26:45.137 --> 26:47.539
But don't tell him that.

26:47.573 --> 26:48.540
- I won't.

26:48.574 --> 26:49.842
- Can I take them home now?

26:49.876 --> 26:51.343
- Of course.

26:51.377 --> 26:54.947
*

26:54.981 --> 26:57.549
- What about Hank?

26:57.583 --> 26:58.685
He's still in there, isn't he?

26:58.685 --> 26:59.819
What's he saying?

26:59.852 --> 27:01.988
- Pippa, you know I can't
tell you that.

27:02.021 --> 27:04.490
*

27:04.523 --> 27:05.892
- Hank likes to keep
our professional

27:05.925 --> 27:09.862
and personal lives separate.

27:09.896 --> 27:12.498
A lot of people we work with
don't even know we're married.

27:12.531 --> 27:16.836
*

27:16.869 --> 27:18.705
- So, gentlemen, where are we?

27:18.705 --> 27:20.506
- After further discussion
with my client,

27:20.539 --> 27:22.775
we've decided not to continue
with these conversations.

27:22.809 --> 27:23.876
- This isn't just going away.

27:23.910 --> 27:25.712
You stop talking,
I have to arraign you.

27:25.712 --> 27:26.913
- There's no need
to rush to that.

27:26.946 --> 27:28.715
You know how the press
will react.

27:28.715 --> 27:30.082
- So how about your client
agrees to a plea,

27:30.116 --> 27:31.517
and you and I
work out a deal?

27:31.550 --> 27:32.719
- But I'm not guilty.

27:32.719 --> 27:34.086
- It would be better
for your family

27:34.120 --> 27:36.622
if this gets settled
quickly and quietly.

27:36.723 --> 27:38.424
- There's nothing quiet
about a charge like this.

27:38.457 --> 27:40.092
You know that.
That's why you're doing this.

27:40.126 --> 27:41.961
- Hank, you've been handling
other peoples' crises

27:41.994 --> 27:43.429
your whole life.

27:43.462 --> 27:45.164
I want you to think about
what you would advise a client

27:45.197 --> 27:48.167
in your position to do.

27:48.200 --> 27:54.741
*

27:54.741 --> 27:56.776
The people request bail
be set at $50,000.

27:56.809 --> 27:59.078
There's also the possibility
of federal charges, Your Honor.

27:59.111 --> 28:00.880
- My client has no record.

28:00.913 --> 28:03.149
He was a successful
political consultant

28:03.182 --> 28:05.217
who made a mid-career change
to public service.

28:05.251 --> 28:07.486
We request R.O.R.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.989
- Given the severity
of the charges,

28:10.022 --> 28:12.658
I'm setting bail
at $30,000.

28:12.759 --> 28:16.028
The defendant will be released
to home detention,

28:16.062 --> 28:19.766
required to wear a GPS
monitoring ankle bracelet,

28:19.766 --> 28:22.134
relinquish his passport,

28:22.168 --> 28:24.771
and refrain from any and all

28:24.804 --> 28:27.273
computer and cell phone usage.

28:27.306 --> 28:29.876

28:29.909 --> 28:31.878
[gavel slams]

28:31.911 --> 28:34.781
[indistinct shouting]
[camera shutters clicking]

28:34.781 --> 28:36.248
- Is your husband a pedophile?

28:36.282 --> 28:37.683
- Please--
- Did you know?

28:37.784 --> 28:38.918
Did you have any idea?

28:38.951 --> 28:40.119
[indistinct shouting]

28:40.152 --> 28:41.520
- Okay, back off, people.

28:41.553 --> 28:42.521
Stop here.

28:42.554 --> 28:43.689
Please stop.

28:43.790 --> 28:45.992
- God, they're like
a pack of wild dogs.

28:46.025 --> 28:47.126
- I'm so sorry.

28:47.159 --> 28:48.795
- You're sorry?

28:48.828 --> 28:50.662
This is your fault.

28:50.696 --> 28:52.865
There were 100 ways
you could've handled this.

28:52.899 --> 28:54.133
You didn't have to destroy us.

28:54.166 --> 28:56.869
- Look, nobody is trying to
destroy you, believe me.

28:56.903 --> 28:58.838
- I got an email today
from my boss.

28:58.871 --> 29:00.606
I'm on leave,

29:00.639 --> 29:02.942
pending transfer to a position

29:02.975 --> 29:05.244
that doesn't involve
contact with juveniles,

29:05.277 --> 29:06.913
sex offenders,

29:06.946 --> 29:08.280
or assault victims!

29:08.314 --> 29:09.448
- Take a breath--
- No, just leave us--don't!

29:09.481 --> 29:10.682
- Pippa, just take a breath.

29:10.716 --> 29:11.818
You--you okay?

29:11.818 --> 29:12.952
- No, I'm not okay!

29:12.985 --> 29:16.522
I am not all right!

29:16.555 --> 29:18.124
[gasping]

29:18.157 --> 29:19.992
My kids are not okay.

29:20.026 --> 29:21.828
Hank is not all right.

29:21.828 --> 29:24.831
[sniffling, breathing]

29:26.598 --> 29:27.967
This is about payback, isn't it?

29:28.000 --> 29:30.602
- What?

29:30.636 --> 29:31.871
- Who got you to do this?

29:31.904 --> 29:33.672
- Nobody.
It's not, I swear to you.

29:33.705 --> 29:36.708
I swear that it's not.
- It is!

29:39.711 --> 29:41.848
What else can it be?

29:41.848 --> 29:43.983
- [whispering]
Pippa...

29:47.186 --> 29:50.156
[poignant music]

29:50.189 --> 29:52.658
- Are you telling me
Hank did this?

29:52.691 --> 29:54.660
*

29:54.693 --> 29:55.862
- [whispering]
I'm sorry.

29:55.862 --> 29:58.865

29:58.865 --> 30:00.699
- No!

30:00.732 --> 30:02.935
[sobbing]

30:02.969 --> 30:04.336
- It's okay.
Sit down, sit down.

30:04.370 --> 30:07.039
- [sobbing]

30:14.046 --> 30:14.180
.

30:17.416 --> 30:17.683
- Pippa...

30:18.650 --> 30:20.352
- You don't have
to talk to me.

30:20.386 --> 30:21.820
- Hank's lawyer asked me
to come up here

30:21.854 --> 30:22.821
and talk to him.

30:22.855 --> 30:23.822
- I know.

30:23.856 --> 30:24.823
That's why I'm leaving.

30:24.857 --> 30:26.392
I can't be here.

30:27.659 --> 30:28.827
- The kids?

30:28.861 --> 30:31.630
- At my parents'--
Pennsylvania.

30:32.932 --> 30:34.934
Thank you for asking.

30:38.637 --> 30:40.039
- I want to thank you.

30:40.072 --> 30:41.908
- Excuse me?

30:41.941 --> 30:45.277
- This arrest, though I still
object to the tactics--

30:45.311 --> 30:48.480
I see it now as
the wake-up call I needed.

30:50.182 --> 30:51.650
My life was out of control.

30:51.683 --> 30:54.453
I was an addict,

30:54.486 --> 30:57.489
trying to fight it.

30:57.523 --> 31:00.026
But I was too ashamed.

31:00.059 --> 31:02.294
- We're past that now.

31:02.328 --> 31:04.997
Hank has been speaking to
a rehabilitation center

31:05.031 --> 31:08.767
with an impressive success rate

31:08.800 --> 31:10.636
where he can get the help
that he needs.

31:10.669 --> 31:12.504
- Good, I--

31:12.538 --> 31:15.174
it's just--
it's not that simple anymore.

31:16.742 --> 31:19.711
- I understand I have
a lot of work to do.

31:19.745 --> 31:21.948
These are deep-seated issues.

31:23.615 --> 31:27.086
And I know I'm facing
serious charges,

31:27.119 --> 31:30.389
but if you could
put them on hold,

31:30.422 --> 31:32.558
it would give me the chance
to save my life

31:32.591 --> 31:33.625
and my family.

31:33.659 --> 31:35.227
- Hank.

31:35.261 --> 31:37.063
Even if I look the other way,

31:37.096 --> 31:38.164
the Feds won't.

31:38.197 --> 31:39.966
- The Feds?

31:39.999 --> 31:42.601
- You're a high-profile
NYPD official.

31:42.634 --> 31:44.103
They've been calling
almost hourly

31:44.136 --> 31:45.371
trying to get
their hooks into you.

31:45.404 --> 31:47.539
And unlike us,
they charge each image

31:47.573 --> 31:49.141
as a mandatory five-year bid.

31:49.175 --> 31:53.145
You'll get the maximum--
20 to 30.

31:53.179 --> 31:54.213
- Is he bluffing?

31:54.246 --> 31:56.682
- No, Hank.

31:56.715 --> 31:59.685
[tense music]

31:59.718 --> 32:00.686
*

32:00.719 --> 32:03.122
- How'd you get on to me?

32:03.155 --> 32:05.324
Someone turned me in to
save his own ass, right?

32:05.357 --> 32:07.126
- Basically, yes.

32:07.159 --> 32:08.494
- Was it Teddy Hawkins?

32:08.527 --> 32:10.162
- You know I can't answer that.

32:10.196 --> 32:12.764
- So how about I make
a deal like Teddy did?

32:12.798 --> 32:14.333
- It's too late for that.

32:14.366 --> 32:17.503
Your rat got all that cheese.

32:17.536 --> 32:18.837
If you want to help us find

32:18.870 --> 32:21.607
the people who produce
these images, these videos--

32:21.640 --> 32:22.808
- Producers?

32:22.841 --> 32:24.276
You think I'm in contact
with people like that?

32:24.310 --> 32:26.712
If I knew anyone
who was doing this to a child,

32:26.745 --> 32:30.482
my God--I'd have called the Feds
on them in an instant.

32:30.516 --> 32:32.218
- You do realize that these
kids you're watching--

32:32.251 --> 32:33.452
these "digital images"--

32:33.485 --> 32:35.721
they're crime scene photos
of real children

32:35.754 --> 32:38.090
being raped.

32:38.124 --> 32:39.558
- I never touched a child.

32:39.591 --> 32:41.393
I was never in a room

32:41.427 --> 32:42.728
with a child.

32:42.761 --> 32:45.097
I don't--I don't know
anyone who has.

32:45.131 --> 32:46.665
I'm a parent!

32:46.698 --> 32:48.400
For God's sake!
- Okay.

32:48.434 --> 32:50.636
I don't know why
you asked me here.

32:50.669 --> 32:52.504
This really isn't going away.

32:52.538 --> 32:54.140
I don't see a deal to be had.

32:54.173 --> 32:55.774
- Don't give me that crap.
There's always a deal.

32:55.807 --> 32:58.310
- You need to focus on
what's going on.

32:58.344 --> 32:59.378
Your friends are going
to desert you

32:59.411 --> 33:01.113
if they haven't already.

33:01.147 --> 33:03.615
All you've got left
is your family.

33:03.649 --> 33:05.651
Don't abandon them.

33:05.684 --> 33:06.885
- Oh, I get it.

33:06.918 --> 33:08.787
Mr. Nice Guy.

33:08.820 --> 33:11.223
Here to help, are you?

33:11.257 --> 33:13.725
- Hank, this isn't
getting us anywhere.

33:13.759 --> 33:15.161
- Whose side are you on?

33:15.194 --> 33:16.695
- There's no conspiracy here.

33:16.728 --> 33:18.130
Plead guilty.
Serve your sentence.

33:18.164 --> 33:19.831
Spare your family
any more pain.

33:19.865 --> 33:23.335
*

33:23.369 --> 33:24.336
- You know what?

33:24.370 --> 33:25.637
Uh...

33:25.671 --> 33:28.340
just...

33:28.374 --> 33:30.142
leave me alone.

33:30.176 --> 33:32.311
I...

33:32.344 --> 33:34.646
Both of you...get out.

33:34.680 --> 33:37.083
*

33:37.116 --> 33:38.650
Just get out.

33:38.684 --> 33:46.692
*

33:49.728 --> 33:52.131
- So your rehab's going well?

33:52.164 --> 33:53.632
I'm glad.
- Thanks.

33:53.665 --> 33:55.367
I heard about
the Abraham thing.

33:55.401 --> 33:56.602
That's a tough one.

33:56.635 --> 33:57.736
I'm sorry
I wasn't there to support.

33:57.769 --> 33:58.804
- You're lucky you missed it.

33:58.837 --> 34:00.339
- Yeah, that's what my dad said.

34:00.372 --> 34:03.775
I took a bullet and
ended up dodging one.

34:03.809 --> 34:05.411
- Your father does have
a way with words.

34:05.444 --> 34:06.712
- Yeah.

34:06.745 --> 34:10.382
Also, he thinks I should use
this leave of absence

34:10.416 --> 34:14.953
as a "transition point"
to explore other opportunities.

34:14.986 --> 34:17.789
- Oh.

34:17.823 --> 34:20.292
And what might they be?

34:20.326 --> 34:22.828
- If I go to Joint Terrorism,
it's a higher profile.

34:22.861 --> 34:26.665
Might give me a leg up.

34:26.698 --> 34:29.968
- Well, that's probably true.

34:30.001 --> 34:32.204
- I'm just not sure that's
what I want to do.

34:32.238 --> 34:35.374
You know, I like it here.

34:35.407 --> 34:38.677
- Well, then you have
a decision to make.

34:38.710 --> 34:40.479
Just remember,

34:40.512 --> 34:42.681
it's your decision,

34:42.714 --> 34:44.750
not your father's.

34:44.783 --> 34:46.485
- I know.

34:46.518 --> 34:49.421
It's just, uh...

34:49.455 --> 34:52.458
he's not gonna accept that.

34:54.926 --> 34:57.196
- Thank you for meeting me.
- Of course.

34:59.931 --> 35:03.935
- I don't have a lot of...

35:03.969 --> 35:05.971
people I can talk to.

35:08.006 --> 35:10.976
I'm staying in a hotel.

35:11.009 --> 35:13.011
I miss my kids.

35:13.044 --> 35:14.846
I want them with me.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.615
Selfish, right?

35:16.648 --> 35:18.250
- No, it's--

35:18.284 --> 35:21.620
it's probably best that
they're out of town right now.

35:23.555 --> 35:25.557
- Lia's back to
sucking her thumb.

35:28.694 --> 35:30.929
Jordan's silent.

35:30.962 --> 35:32.531
[sniffles]

35:32.564 --> 35:34.633
- With time,

35:34.666 --> 35:36.368
and therapy, it can--

35:36.402 --> 35:37.903
- My father...

35:40.606 --> 35:44.843
Aside from wanting
to kill Hank,

35:44.876 --> 35:48.514
wants me to...

35:48.547 --> 35:52.818
wants me to change
their last name.

35:52.851 --> 35:55.254
Says anyone who Googles them

35:55.287 --> 35:57.423
for the rest of their lives

35:57.456 --> 36:01.660
will know their father

36:01.693 --> 36:04.430
is a pedophile.

36:07.399 --> 36:09.401
- I'm so sorry.

36:11.503 --> 36:14.506
- My mother, she's blaming me.

36:18.410 --> 36:20.312
"How could you not suspect him?

36:20.346 --> 36:21.747
You do this for a living."

36:21.780 --> 36:24.416
- Pippa...

36:24.450 --> 36:27.619
men who do this

36:27.653 --> 36:30.989
have to hide it.

36:31.022 --> 36:33.792
They get very good

36:33.825 --> 36:36.795
at compartmentalizing.

36:36.828 --> 36:38.630
[tense music]

36:38.664 --> 36:40.466
- I married him.

36:40.499 --> 36:45.036
*

36:45.070 --> 36:48.507
I slept with him for 12 years.

36:48.540 --> 36:52.511
*

36:52.544 --> 36:54.613
I-I didn't know he was sick.

36:54.646 --> 36:58.016
*

36:58.049 --> 36:59.951
No radar went off.

36:59.985 --> 37:02.554
*

37:02.588 --> 37:04.390
I...

37:04.423 --> 37:07.759
how blind am I--
how stupid?

37:07.793 --> 37:12.431
*

37:12.464 --> 37:15.066
[glass clinking]
- Thanks.

37:15.100 --> 37:16.402
- Yeah.

37:16.435 --> 37:17.403
Sounds like Pippa's
starting to accept

37:17.436 --> 37:18.804
this is really happening.

37:18.837 --> 37:19.871
- What about Hank?

37:19.905 --> 37:22.774
- [sighs]
In and out of denial.

37:22.808 --> 37:24.075
Thinks he can make a deal,

37:24.109 --> 37:25.877
somehow get away with it.

37:25.911 --> 37:28.547
Refuses to go on the registry.

37:28.580 --> 37:29.848
If I can't get him to plead,

37:29.881 --> 37:31.383
the Feds are gonna
take over.

37:31.417 --> 37:34.953
- How many people have
we put away for this?

37:34.986 --> 37:37.523
Not once have I ever had

37:37.556 --> 37:39.358
sympathy for any of them.

37:39.391 --> 37:41.893
- That's not our problem.

37:43.362 --> 37:45.464
It is our problem.

37:45.497 --> 37:47.232
[cell phone buzzes]

37:48.634 --> 37:51.102
Yeah, Carmen,
I said no calls.

37:51.136 --> 37:52.804
What?

37:52.838 --> 37:55.974
Okay.

37:56.007 --> 37:58.076
Where?

37:58.109 --> 37:59.545
Thank you.

37:59.578 --> 38:00.946
- What?

38:00.979 --> 38:04.182
- Hank Abraham just
slashed his wrists.

38:04.215 --> 38:07.185
[dramatic music]

38:12.524 --> 38:12.658
.

38:14.793 --> 38:14.993
- Pippa.

38:16.662 --> 38:18.096
How's he doing?

38:18.129 --> 38:21.199
- Uh, he lost blood,
but he'll make it.

38:21.232 --> 38:24.770
I found him on the floor
of the bathroom.

38:24.803 --> 38:26.004
I-I--

38:26.037 --> 38:28.039
only stopped by the apartment
to pick up some things

38:28.073 --> 38:31.443
for the kids.

38:31.477 --> 38:34.613
If I hadn't--
- But you did.

38:34.646 --> 38:36.882
You saved his life.

38:36.915 --> 38:40.652
- I just reacted.

38:40.686 --> 38:42.754
I didn't want to lose him.

38:42.788 --> 38:46.124
[indistinct P.A. announcement]

38:46.157 --> 38:47.459
[sighs]

38:47.493 --> 38:49.761
Does this ever
stop getting worse?

38:49.795 --> 38:52.398
- No.

38:52.431 --> 38:55.601
Not until your husband
accepts where he is.

38:59.104 --> 39:01.306
- Although Mr. Hawkins
was unaware of

39:01.407 --> 39:02.908
the age of the victim,

39:02.941 --> 39:05.210
when he offered her
an alcoholic drink,

39:05.243 --> 39:08.414
he is pleading guilty to
one misdemeanor count

39:08.414 --> 39:10.416
of unlawfully dealing
with a child.

39:10.416 --> 39:14.420
He has also established
a $1 million fund

39:14.420 --> 39:17.689
to deal with victims of
alcohol and drug addiction

39:17.723 --> 39:19.124
and sex abuse.

39:19.157 --> 39:20.325
He's very eager...

39:20.426 --> 39:23.094
- That's, what,
six months at most?

39:23.128 --> 39:26.665
Teddy skates while Abraham's
probably looking at hard time.

39:26.698 --> 39:28.333
- Yeah, I heard he tried
to kill himself.

39:28.434 --> 39:30.168
That poor, dumb bastard.

39:30.201 --> 39:32.170
Meanwhile,

39:32.203 --> 39:34.105
I spoke to Ryan at
the Task Force.

39:34.139 --> 39:38.076
He says he still hasn't
heard from you.

39:38.109 --> 39:41.212
- Dad,

39:41.246 --> 39:44.249
I appreciate the opportunity.

39:44.282 --> 39:45.551
But for now,

39:45.584 --> 39:49.287
I want to stay at SVU.

39:49.320 --> 39:53.659
- There are very few bright,
shining paths in life, son.

39:53.692 --> 39:55.461
You've got one

39:55.461 --> 39:59.030
laid out in front of you
right now.

39:59.064 --> 40:02.000
And if you don't take it,

40:02.033 --> 40:04.035
somebody else will.

40:08.674 --> 40:10.241
- Mr. Abraham.

40:10.275 --> 40:12.177
On the multiple charges
of possessing

40:12.210 --> 40:15.747
an obscene sexual performance
by a child,

40:15.781 --> 40:18.116
how do you plead?

40:21.019 --> 40:22.287
- Guilty, Your Honor.

40:22.320 --> 40:24.590
I've hurt my family,
my friends,

40:24.623 --> 40:26.024
and the department.

40:26.057 --> 40:27.425
Whatever led me down this road,

40:27.459 --> 40:29.394
there is no excuse
for my crimes.

40:29.427 --> 40:30.696
I'm sorry.

40:30.729 --> 40:32.464
- Also, Your Honor,
it should be noted

40:32.498 --> 40:34.533
that Mr. Abraham has begun

40:34.566 --> 40:38.036
a rigorous addiction
treatment program.

40:38.069 --> 40:39.204
- Mr. Barba?

40:39.237 --> 40:41.439
- Given the defendant's
cooperation

40:41.473 --> 40:42.974
with our ongoing investigation

40:43.008 --> 40:45.343
and commitment to treatment,

40:45.376 --> 40:48.146
the People believe that justice
will best be served

40:48.179 --> 40:51.149
if the four year sentences
on each count

40:51.182 --> 40:53.051
run concurrently.

40:53.084 --> 40:54.620
- So ordered.

40:54.653 --> 40:56.454
The defendant will
serve his sentence

40:56.488 --> 40:58.524
in protective custody.

40:58.557 --> 41:02.093
And he will remain on
the sex offenders' registry

41:02.127 --> 41:04.563
for a minimum of 20 years.

41:04.596 --> 41:06.097
[raps gavel]

41:06.131 --> 41:11.302
*

41:11.336 --> 41:14.039
- That's the best
we could ask for.

41:14.072 --> 41:17.408
- Thank you, Counselor.

41:17.442 --> 41:25.450
*

41:29.220 --> 41:32.991
- He's still my husband.

41:33.024 --> 41:36.327
We have two children.

41:36.361 --> 41:39.998
- I get it.

41:40.031 --> 41:41.466
I get it.

41:41.567 --> 41:45.737
*

41:45.771 --> 41:47.472
- Abraham's family--

41:47.573 --> 41:49.107
how do they start over
after this?

41:49.140 --> 41:51.577
- I can't even think about it.

41:53.444 --> 41:55.013
- Still up for that nightcap?

41:55.046 --> 41:56.582
- Yeah.

41:56.615 --> 42:00.018
I could really use a drink.

42:00.051 --> 42:02.688
Uh, you know what?

42:02.721 --> 42:04.590
Not here.

42:04.590 --> 42:06.091
[sighs]

42:06.124 --> 42:08.126
- Wherever you want to go.

42:08.159 --> 42:10.662
You tell me.
- Okay.
