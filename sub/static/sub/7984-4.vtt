00:40.884 --> 00:43.318
(rumbling)

01:02.706 --> 01:04.772
(rumbling)

01:10.647 --> 01:14.616
(thunder cracking)

01:16.286 --> 01:19.754
So, if Amberle fails the trial,
the Ellcrys will kill her?

01:19.756 --> 01:23.291
If she succumbs to her fear, yes.

01:23.293 --> 01:26.814
And we will lose any hope of saving
this world from the Dagda Mor.

01:27.954 --> 01:29.795
Great. Okay, then.

01:39.499 --> 01:41.199
(screeching)

01:41.201 --> 01:44.140
(indistinct whispers)

02:24.211 --> 02:25.977
(screeching)

02:30.083 --> 02:34.419
(distant wails)

02:44.130 --> 02:45.236
Unh!

02:58.478 --> 03:00.035
Get up, Amberle.

03:07.309 --> 03:09.287
Look, I didn't mean to hurt you.

03:09.289 --> 03:12.056
- Why are you lying?
- I'm not.

03:12.058 --> 03:15.059
You never loved me.

03:15.061 --> 03:17.562
You have feelings for <i> him.</i>

03:17.564 --> 03:19.597
(grunting)

03:21.268 --> 03:23.968
Words aren't enough, Amberle.

03:24.204 --> 03:27.639
You need to prove your
commitment to the quest.

03:29.609 --> 03:32.043
I'll do whatever it takes.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.680
Prove it.

03:35.682 --> 03:37.181
Kill me.

03:37.183 --> 03:37.749
What?

03:37.751 --> 03:40.418
There will be no mercy
beyond these walls.

03:40.420 --> 03:43.521
The Demons feed on weakness.

03:43.523 --> 03:45.023
And you?

03:45.025 --> 03:48.026
You're as weak as they come.

03:48.261 --> 03:52.463
If you're going to survive, you
have to harden your heart.

03:52.465 --> 03:54.666
(grunting, fighting)

03:58.505 --> 03:59.237
Now kill me!

03:59.239 --> 04:00.571
Please don't make me do this!

04:00.573 --> 04:02.206
The quest is more important

04:02.208 --> 04:03.041
than any one life!

04:03.043 --> 04:05.710
You can't let your
emotions get in the way.

04:05.712 --> 04:08.212
Now stand and fight me,

04:08.214 --> 04:10.615
or die with everyone else.

04:16.022 --> 04:18.022
You're weak.

04:18.024 --> 04:20.024
- (shouts)
- Unh!

04:20.627 --> 04:23.528
(thunder cracking)

04:25.565 --> 04:27.131
Is this your usual grave look

04:27.133 --> 04:29.000
or should I be worried?

04:29.002 --> 04:31.235
She's losing the fight.

04:31.771 --> 04:34.639
(grunting, fighting)

04:39.646 --> 04:43.548
You neglected your oath
while the world burned.

04:43.550 --> 04:44.716
You're no hero.

04:44.718 --> 04:47.318
The Ellcrys knows the truth.

04:52.392 --> 04:54.525
(sputters)

04:54.527 --> 04:57.428
(gasps)

05:13.346 --> 05:16.147
Congratulations, Amberle.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.116
You passed the test.

05:18.118 --> 05:20.651
Now, don't let anything distract you.

05:21.215 --> 05:23.614
Not fear. Not love.

05:24.698 --> 05:27.036
The fate of the world depends on it.

05:30.764 --> 05:34.465
Where's the Bloodfire?

06:41.734 --> 06:45.369
(rumbling)

06:49.409 --> 06:52.443
(rumbling)

06:55.715 --> 06:57.915
(door closes)

07:17.203 --> 07:20.738
The Ellcrys has chosen Amberle

07:20.740 --> 07:23.674
to carry its seed to the Bloodfire.

07:23.676 --> 07:28.479
As the tree has entrusted
her with its life,

07:28.481 --> 07:34.418
so now must we place our
lives in her hands.

07:40.193 --> 07:42.627
My dear child, I am so sorry that

07:42.629 --> 07:46.430
the burden falls on your shoulders.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.802
Come, now.

07:51.804 --> 07:54.305
We have no time to waste.

08:20.266 --> 08:25.301
_

08:28.341 --> 08:31.122
_

08:31.147 --> 08:33.645
_

08:33.813 --> 08:36.948
_

08:37.716 --> 08:40.614
_

08:40.746 --> 08:46.442
_

08:56.436 --> 08:58.469
What are you?

08:58.938 --> 09:01.739
(sputtering)

09:09.826 --> 09:12.882
(Amberle) This is what I saw in my
vision on a stained-glass window.

09:20.562 --> 09:23.162
Do you recognize it?

09:23.832 --> 09:25.965
Doesn't the codex have
a map or something?

09:25.967 --> 09:30.269
The Safehold is referred
to only once in the codex,

09:30.271 --> 09:32.405
stating that it lies beyond

09:32.407 --> 09:36.175
the Wilderun, in the Old World.

09:36.177 --> 09:38.578
I don't know about the rest of
them, but I have had enough

09:38.580 --> 09:40.546
of this magician's
cryptic pronouncements.

09:40.548 --> 09:43.383
You know nothing of the world of magic.

09:43.385 --> 09:46.075
- Allanon, wha...
- Is just a man.

09:46.855 --> 09:48.287
Beneath the cloak and
the furrowed brow,

09:48.289 --> 09:50.289
he is the same enemy that we have spent

09:50.291 --> 09:52.091
our entire lives fighting.

09:52.093 --> 09:54.460
I am not your enemy, Prince.

09:55.397 --> 09:59.332
(Ander) Sending a young girl
out into the wilderness

09:59.334 --> 10:03.569
with no map and no protection...

10:04.939 --> 10:06.339
That is a bad plan.

10:06.341 --> 10:09.308
The Ellcrys has spoken.

10:09.310 --> 10:12.912
That ends the debate.

10:15.350 --> 10:16.616
Do you remember the summer you sent

10:16.618 --> 10:19.252
Aine, Arion and me to
the Fort in Drey Wood?

10:19.254 --> 10:21.487
We met an Elf there named Rin Katsin.

10:21.489 --> 10:22.955
He told us stories of his adventures

10:22.957 --> 10:26.592
beyond the ancient Elvin
sentinels, inside the Wilderun.

10:27.462 --> 10:29.328
(Eventine) Send word to Drey Wood.

10:29.330 --> 10:33.299
I want Rin Katsin brought
there immediately.

10:33.301 --> 10:35.134
Crispin...

10:35.136 --> 10:37.103
You will escort Amberle, Wil,

10:37.105 --> 10:39.472
and Allanon to meet him.

10:39.474 --> 10:41.040
You'll leave at first light.

10:41.042 --> 10:41.707
Yes, Your Grace.

10:41.709 --> 10:43.509
No mention of this plan
can leave this room.

10:43.511 --> 10:48.047
The Dagda Mor still has his
traitor within these walls.

10:59.694 --> 11:02.295
Amberle, wait. Are you okay?

11:02.297 --> 11:03.963
Well, I nearly died for the privilege

11:03.965 --> 11:05.698
of going on a quest to
save the Four Lands.

11:05.700 --> 11:07.066
I don't know where I'm headed,

11:07.068 --> 11:08.701
but I suspect it'll be
someplace full of Demons.

11:08.703 --> 11:10.103
So no, Wil, I'm not okay.

11:10.105 --> 11:12.405
Well, it's a good thing
I'm coming with you.

11:12.407 --> 11:13.673
I can annoy the Demons to death.

11:13.675 --> 11:16.162
This is no time for jokes.

11:18.642 --> 11:21.381
Whatever is going on, you can tell me.

11:25.253 --> 11:26.986
I don't need you to hold my hand,

11:26.988 --> 11:28.020
and I don't need your emotions

11:28.022 --> 11:29.732
getting in the way of
what we have to do.

11:39.033 --> 11:43.236
(crow cawing)

11:47.873 --> 11:50.042
All right, you're gonna
sneak into the palace,

11:50.044 --> 11:53.613
find the half-breed,
and snag the Stones.

11:53.615 --> 11:54.514
If I get caught,

11:54.516 --> 11:57.116
I'll spend the rest of
my life in a jail cell.

11:57.118 --> 11:59.185
Yeah? It'll be a lot worse for you

11:59.187 --> 12:00.631
if you come back empty-handed.

12:00.775 --> 12:01.775
Now, go!

12:04.993 --> 12:09.162
Don't even think about
double-crossing me.

12:12.316 --> 12:17.052
(footsteps approaching)

12:22.470 --> 12:23.836
Thanks for coming.

12:24.479 --> 12:26.404
I just had to see him one last time.

12:27.195 --> 12:29.261
Of course.

12:30.051 --> 12:32.051
I'm so sorry about Jace, Catania.

12:32.053 --> 12:34.754
- About all of this.
- I know.

12:36.291 --> 12:39.292
I just can't believe
you're leaving again.

12:39.294 --> 12:41.761
Losing you once was bad enough.

12:41.763 --> 12:44.697
I'm going to come back.

12:48.770 --> 12:52.271
Hey, what happened to you in there?

12:52.470 --> 12:54.603
I saw Lorin.

12:56.092 --> 12:59.561
It was so real, I could
touch him, and smell him.

13:02.052 --> 13:04.585
He said I never loved him.

13:04.844 --> 13:05.709
That I was a coward.

13:05.853 --> 13:08.754
No, you're none of
those things, Amberle.

13:08.756 --> 13:09.622
It was just an illusion.

13:09.624 --> 13:11.390
A way for the Ellcrys to test you.

13:11.392 --> 13:14.240
I know... but it was right.

13:15.798 --> 13:18.532
I didn't love Lorin.

13:19.418 --> 13:21.285
And I was scared.

13:23.571 --> 13:25.001
(softly) We all are.

13:27.407 --> 13:28.407
Commander Tilton...

13:28.643 --> 13:32.778
we have a situation in the sanctuary.

13:41.659 --> 13:42.992
(gasps)

13:44.792 --> 13:45.424
Went.

13:45.426 --> 13:48.094
We need to get Amberle
back to the palace.

13:48.096 --> 13:52.198
- Let's go!
- (soldiers muttering)

14:01.311 --> 14:01.874
(birds chirping)

14:01.876 --> 14:02.775
(Wil) Bandon?

14:02.777 --> 14:05.278
What are you doing out here?

14:07.391 --> 14:09.568
I wanted to see the sky.

14:10.176 --> 14:11.909
When I was a kid...

14:12.420 --> 14:13.753
I dreamed of coming to Arborlon

14:13.755 --> 14:15.264
and seeing the royal palace.

14:16.814 --> 14:18.180
Now I'm here...

14:18.660 --> 14:20.436
All you want to do is go home.

14:21.078 --> 14:22.287
I have no home.

14:30.138 --> 14:31.437
If you let me bandage your wrists,

14:31.439 --> 14:34.774
- they'll heal faster.
- Don't touch me!

14:35.510 --> 14:39.545
Does something happen
when people touch you?

14:41.804 --> 14:44.238
I see things.

14:44.753 --> 14:46.820
Like what?

14:47.719 --> 14:49.852
Their death.

14:51.793 --> 14:53.893
Is that what you meant about Amberle?

14:53.895 --> 14:55.261
Before she entered the Ellcrys,

14:55.263 --> 14:57.163
you said something
terrible would happen

14:57.165 --> 14:59.265
if I didn't go with her.

15:04.906 --> 15:05.938
When you touched Amberle,

15:05.940 --> 15:08.841
did you see anything like this?

15:11.859 --> 15:15.661
(Bandon) Yeah, this symbol.

15:16.918 --> 15:18.951
It was in the room where they died.

15:19.320 --> 15:20.320
They?

15:20.888 --> 15:22.779
- You mean Amberle and Allanon?
- No.

15:23.658 --> 15:25.232
Amberle and another girl.

15:25.870 --> 15:27.736
A Human.

15:33.534 --> 15:35.701
(grunting)

16:03.464 --> 16:05.436
(door opens, closes)

16:05.461 --> 16:08.229
Hey, short tips.

16:09.003 --> 16:11.436
Long time no see.

16:24.603 --> 16:27.071
I've received word from the
Fort Commander at Drey Wood.

16:27.455 --> 16:28.588
Rin Katsin has been summoned.

16:28.590 --> 16:30.431
He'll be there in less
than two days' time.

16:30.986 --> 16:31.986
Thank you, Arion.

16:32.530 --> 16:34.360
Please pass that on to Allanon.

16:39.409 --> 16:40.909
About what I said earlier, I...

16:40.911 --> 16:43.346
Yes, I've been thinking about that.

16:44.627 --> 16:46.634
And I've come to a decision.

16:48.719 --> 16:51.854
Even if we defeat this Demon horde...

16:53.588 --> 16:55.190
I will not abdicate.

16:56.932 --> 17:00.947
If this crisis has taught me anything, it
is that you are not yet ready to be king.

17:04.077 --> 17:07.313
I apologize for what I said earlier,

17:07.338 --> 17:09.270
but... but please, Father,
do not let that overshadow

17:09.271 --> 17:10.805
- my accomplishments...
- Accomplishments?

17:10.807 --> 17:11.849
What would they be?

17:13.242 --> 17:14.041
I deserve the crown.

17:14.044 --> 17:18.980
No one deserves the crown.

17:20.005 --> 17:23.122
Your brother understood that.
Why can't you?

17:26.857 --> 17:29.391
It is hard to compete with
the ghost of a brother

17:29.393 --> 17:33.177
whose stature increases in your
mind with every passing year.

17:34.016 --> 17:35.615
My decision is made.

17:39.336 --> 17:41.503
We have a problem.

17:47.411 --> 17:51.046
You have exactly five seconds
before I call the guards.

17:51.048 --> 17:51.913
Please don't.

17:51.915 --> 17:53.815
Give me one good reason not to.

17:53.817 --> 17:56.551
Cephalo saw you use the Stones.

17:56.553 --> 17:59.454
He sent me here to steal them.

17:59.456 --> 18:01.523
I said a <i> good</i> reason.

18:01.725 --> 18:03.425
Will, he'll kill me if I don't.

18:03.427 --> 18:07.595
You really expect me to believe
your own father would do that.

18:07.597 --> 18:10.465
Cephalo is not my father.

18:10.467 --> 18:12.333
I'm his property.

18:12.335 --> 18:15.637
He bought me when I was a little girl.

18:15.639 --> 18:17.906
I spent the days learning how to steal

18:17.908 --> 18:21.509
and my nights fending off his men.

18:22.012 --> 18:26.648
So, yeah... he would kill me.

18:28.785 --> 18:32.987
I'm sorry. Nobody deserves that.

18:33.657 --> 18:35.457
But I can't give you the Stones.

18:35.459 --> 18:39.327
Look, I don't want the Stones.

18:39.329 --> 18:41.996
I just want your help.

18:43.333 --> 18:46.735
I want to get away from him.

18:47.571 --> 18:52.540
And I want a new life... just like you.

18:53.777 --> 18:57.879
Look, my new life could
be very, very short.

18:57.881 --> 18:59.547
I'm in way over my head.

18:59.549 --> 19:01.850
But what you did at the camp,

19:01.852 --> 19:04.052
jumping in front of that Demon.

19:04.054 --> 19:08.823
I've never seen anyone do
something so brave before.

19:13.864 --> 19:17.532
That princess is lucky to have you.

19:18.668 --> 19:21.402
Amberle and I aren't together.

19:21.404 --> 19:24.639
In fact, she wants
nothing to do with me.

19:24.641 --> 19:25.940
Well...

19:25.942 --> 19:29.110
If I had someone like you,

19:29.112 --> 19:31.713
I would never let him go.

19:31.715 --> 19:33.748
♪♪

19:33.750 --> 19:38.054
♪ I might be yours, as yours... ♪

19:38.196 --> 19:40.129
Nice try.

19:40.390 --> 19:43.525
But I'm not falling
for your little ro...

19:51.168 --> 19:54.135
I get why you don't trust me.

19:55.572 --> 19:58.573
But I am sorry.

20:09.853 --> 20:11.820
Apology accepted.

20:24.835 --> 20:27.101
(birds chirping)

20:27.103 --> 20:29.571
Went was killed by one of
the Dagda Mor's Demons,

20:29.573 --> 20:31.172
probably the same one
that murdered the Chosen

20:31.174 --> 20:33.074
and gave away our
position in Wing Hove.

20:33.076 --> 20:36.511
Yeah, but it's after me, isn't it?

20:36.713 --> 20:38.446
You are the only thing standing between

20:38.448 --> 20:39.581
the Dagda Mor and its freedom.

20:39.583 --> 20:42.450
Well, then we should leave
for Drey Wood tonight,

20:42.452 --> 20:44.552
- under cover of darkness.
- No.

20:44.554 --> 20:45.820
We cannot depart until we have found

20:45.822 --> 20:46.821
this Demon and destroyed it.

20:46.823 --> 20:49.724
Otherwise, it'll keep informing
the Dagda Mor of your movements.

20:49.726 --> 20:52.627
And if it comes for me, what then?

20:52.629 --> 20:55.129
As long as you remain
within the palace,

20:55.131 --> 20:59.801
Wil and I will take guard
of you, at all times.

21:04.708 --> 21:08.142
Speaking of Wil, where is he exactly?

21:09.913 --> 21:13.481
I'll never call you short tips again.

21:18.173 --> 21:21.208
(door opens, closes)

21:25.795 --> 21:28.196
- (gasps)
- Ooh, sorry!

21:35.872 --> 21:38.907
Are you okay?

21:40.543 --> 21:42.644
You're gonna die.

21:42.646 --> 21:44.712
Excuse me?

21:44.714 --> 21:46.080
Don't go upstairs.

21:46.082 --> 21:48.516
It's not safe. You don't understand!

21:48.518 --> 21:50.251
You've got to listen to me!

21:51.288 --> 21:53.054
Listen to me!

21:58.728 --> 22:02.063
- What is it?
- Eretria?

22:06.903 --> 22:08.569
- (panting)
- Oh! Hey!

22:08.571 --> 22:11.105
Wait, you can't go up there!

22:17.013 --> 22:19.580
(Amberle) Stop that Rover!

22:27.123 --> 22:30.725
There's nowhere to run, Eretria.

22:43.907 --> 22:46.708
Oh! (gasping)

22:46.910 --> 22:49.143
(Allanon) Don't let her escape.

23:17.774 --> 23:19.173
The cloak's a nice touch, Rover,

23:19.175 --> 23:21.309
but your boots gave you away.

23:21.311 --> 23:24.078
(grunting, fighting)

23:38.596 --> 23:41.864
(grunting)

23:44.836 --> 23:46.802
Excellent work, Commander Tilton.

23:46.804 --> 23:48.070
Thank you, Your Grace.

23:48.072 --> 23:50.072
Prince Ander assisted
with the apprehension.

23:50.074 --> 23:52.775
If by assisted you mean
got his ass kicked,

23:52.777 --> 23:54.844
yeah, he was a big help.

23:54.846 --> 23:57.079
Rover, do you have a name?

23:57.081 --> 23:58.280
Does it matter?

23:58.282 --> 23:59.982
We all look the same to you, anyway.

23:59.984 --> 24:01.183
You'll address the king

24:01.185 --> 24:02.651
with the respect he deserves.

24:02.653 --> 24:04.987
He's not my king, Elf.

24:04.989 --> 24:07.656
(Amberle) Her name is Eretria.

24:08.860 --> 24:12.161
I met her on the road.
She tried to rob me.

24:12.897 --> 24:15.364
You will be charged with the
murder of the royal gardener

24:15.366 --> 24:19.201
and the attempted assassination
of the princess, Amberle.

24:19.203 --> 24:20.203
Do you understand?

24:20.827 --> 24:23.339
Are you insane? I didn't kill anyone.

24:23.341 --> 24:24.807
(Amberle) Besides me and Allanon,

24:24.809 --> 24:26.609
there were two other witnesses.

24:26.611 --> 24:30.980
Look, I'm a lot of things,
but I'm not a killer.

24:30.982 --> 24:34.183
Then what are you doing in Arborlon?

24:34.652 --> 24:36.051
She came for the Elfstones.

24:36.053 --> 24:39.922
But I wouldn't put anything
past her at this point.

24:41.325 --> 24:43.893
(Eventide) An Elvin court
will decide your fate.

24:43.895 --> 24:48.297
If you are guilty, the
penalty will be death.

24:48.299 --> 24:49.932
Take her to the cells.

24:49.934 --> 24:52.418
Amberle, please! I didn't do this!

24:53.404 --> 24:57.004
I didn't do this! No!

25:01.623 --> 25:03.555
I need to talk to her.

25:03.644 --> 25:06.445
It's important.

25:06.651 --> 25:09.151
You've got 30 seconds.

25:09.353 --> 25:10.986
- Where are they?
- Wil, I didn't...

25:10.988 --> 25:12.915
The Stones, Eretria, now!

25:14.540 --> 25:15.727
Right hand pocket.

25:19.397 --> 25:21.363
Liar and thief wasn't good enough, huh?

25:21.365 --> 25:24.266
You had to add murderer to
your list of accomplishments.

25:24.268 --> 25:26.068
No. No, when Amberle recognized me,

25:26.070 --> 25:29.055
I took off, but I
didn't try to kill her.

25:29.080 --> 25:29.679
Save it.

25:29.874 --> 25:31.907
Amberle was right about you all along.

25:31.909 --> 25:34.443
You only give a damn about yourself.

25:36.113 --> 25:37.046
Think about it, Wil.

25:37.048 --> 25:38.781
Why would I come all the
way here to kill Amberle

25:38.783 --> 25:42.751
when I had a million chances
out there in the woods?

25:43.120 --> 25:45.988
How does murdering her even help me?

25:45.990 --> 25:47.856
If someone's really trying to kill her,

25:47.858 --> 25:51.427
then they're still out there.

25:51.429 --> 25:53.429
Time's up!

26:21.219 --> 26:23.442
My father's sword.

26:26.672 --> 26:28.121
The Elvin people...

26:29.233 --> 26:31.300
were deprived of a great king

26:31.302 --> 26:34.036
when he was taken from us.

26:36.374 --> 26:39.408
May it protect you on your journey.

26:43.414 --> 26:45.879
I miss him every day.

26:45.904 --> 26:47.070
Me too.

26:47.416 --> 26:48.684
Now more than ever.

26:59.997 --> 27:03.465
You remind me of him so much.

27:03.467 --> 27:05.968
He was just like you.

27:05.970 --> 27:10.472
Headstrong, but selfless...

27:11.842 --> 27:14.810
and very brave.

27:20.051 --> 27:24.353
Arborlon could not have
chosen a finer protector.

27:31.042 --> 27:33.709
You come back to us.

27:35.022 --> 27:36.219
I will.

27:42.327 --> 27:43.804
(Allanon) Is something bothering you?

27:43.829 --> 27:45.040
I don't understand why we
can't leave immediately

27:45.042 --> 27:46.689
now that the murderer has been caught.

27:47.821 --> 27:49.593
I'm not so sure that's the case.

27:49.618 --> 27:51.513
Why am I not surprised you're
taking the Rover's side?

27:51.515 --> 27:53.671
I have no love for Eretria,

27:53.696 --> 27:55.681
but she only came for the Elfstones.

27:55.782 --> 27:59.021
How was she able to steal the
Stones in the first place?

28:00.224 --> 28:03.258
She attacked me in my room.

28:03.961 --> 28:06.562
We struggled and she knocked me out.

28:06.564 --> 28:08.230
Oh, I take it back, then.

28:08.232 --> 28:09.598
She sounds totally trustworthy.

28:09.600 --> 28:12.401
Look, she could have killed us
in the woods or the Rover camp.

28:12.403 --> 28:14.303
Why come all the way here to do it?

28:14.305 --> 28:16.872
Maybe she has a flair for the dramatic.

28:16.874 --> 28:19.007
But it doesn't matter.
Allanon and I saw her

28:19.009 --> 28:19.842
with our own eyes.

28:19.844 --> 28:22.444
Well, our eyes aren't
impervious to deception.

28:22.446 --> 28:26.248
That's Druid-speak for "Maybe
you should reconsider."

28:26.250 --> 28:27.983
I know you hate Eretria,
but you can't let

28:27.985 --> 28:30.619
your feelings cloud your judgment.

28:31.088 --> 28:32.454
If you have doubts that Eretria did it,

28:32.456 --> 28:33.422
why didn't you tell her?

28:33.424 --> 28:35.290
For the same reason you didn't tell her

28:35.292 --> 28:37.593
her that you slept with the Rover girl.

28:37.595 --> 28:39.094
It does not serve our mission.

28:39.096 --> 28:41.630
You seriously have to stop
with the mind reading.

28:41.632 --> 28:44.533
There is a powerful Demon
inside this palace.

28:44.535 --> 28:46.168
Up 'til now, it's been successful

28:46.170 --> 28:47.970
cloaking itself from me.

28:47.972 --> 28:49.138
If we can convince it

28:49.140 --> 28:52.274
that we've let our guard down...

28:52.276 --> 28:53.575
It might strike again.

28:53.577 --> 28:55.611
And this time, we'll be ready.

28:55.613 --> 28:59.314
But we still don't know
what this Demon looks like.

29:00.184 --> 29:02.417
Wait, maybe Bandon could help.

29:02.419 --> 29:04.086
The boy? How?

29:04.088 --> 29:08.123
He told me when he touches
people, he sees their death.

29:09.493 --> 29:11.460
He's a seer.

29:11.462 --> 29:15.264
That is a powerful and dangerous gift.

29:15.266 --> 29:20.102
Do you think he could see a
dead person's final moments?

29:22.273 --> 29:24.640
(Bandon) Why did you bring me here?

29:24.642 --> 29:27.176
Wil told me about your gift.

29:27.178 --> 29:29.978
Seeing death is no gift.

29:29.980 --> 29:31.547
You are a seer, Bandon.

29:31.549 --> 29:33.682
You don't just see death.

29:33.684 --> 29:35.350
You see possibilities.

29:35.352 --> 29:38.587
Your parents didn't understand that,

29:38.589 --> 29:40.489
but I do.

29:40.491 --> 29:43.292
My mentor, Bremen, was a seer.

29:43.294 --> 29:45.527
I watched as he walked
the perilous ledge

29:45.529 --> 29:49.198
between darkness and light.

29:49.200 --> 29:50.599
(Amberle) Allanon!

29:50.601 --> 29:52.501
I tried to stop her.

29:52.503 --> 29:55.070
Please, let the Chosen rest in peace.

29:55.072 --> 29:57.139
My plan is to save the Ellcrys,

29:57.141 --> 29:58.974
and there will be no peace
until that is done.

29:58.976 --> 30:02.678
Lorin pledged himself
to protect the tree.

30:02.680 --> 30:04.980
Let him help us.

30:18.128 --> 30:21.129
(Allanon) All we need
are his last moments.

30:21.131 --> 30:24.099
Look for the face of the killer.

30:40.985 --> 30:42.351
(gasps)

30:59.236 --> 30:59.701
Unh!

30:59.703 --> 31:03.272
- (groaning)
- What did you see?

31:06.782 --> 31:08.648
It was her.

31:08.650 --> 31:10.117
You killed him.

31:10.119 --> 31:10.951
What?

31:10.953 --> 31:15.822
She had the knife... and silver eyes.

31:17.760 --> 31:20.861
It wasn't the princess that you saw.

31:21.930 --> 31:24.598
It was a Changeling.

31:32.508 --> 31:34.942
The Changeling is an ancient Demon,

31:34.944 --> 31:36.777
a shape shifter that can inhabit

31:36.779 --> 31:38.679
the form of any being it chooses.

31:38.681 --> 31:39.947
That explains how it's been able

31:39.949 --> 31:42.616
to hide in the palace.

31:43.686 --> 31:46.620
(Amberle) That thing killed Lorin.

31:48.037 --> 31:51.638
The Ellcrys was trying
to warn me, and I ran.

31:52.475 --> 31:54.775
If you hadn't run, you'd be dead by now

31:54.777 --> 31:57.645
and all hope would be lost.

31:59.816 --> 32:01.849
Now, the Demon does not know

32:01.851 --> 32:04.652
that we are aware of its existence.

32:04.654 --> 32:07.121
That could work to our advantage.

32:07.123 --> 32:08.856
The Changeling wants me.

32:08.858 --> 32:12.727
- That's why it's still here.
- If you are considering

32:12.729 --> 32:17.131
offering yourself as bait...
think again.

32:18.067 --> 32:19.800
What if we use a decoy?

32:19.802 --> 32:22.236
Someone with nothing to lose.

32:22.238 --> 32:23.971
Eretria will never help us.

32:23.973 --> 32:28.509
She will, if it's in
her own self-interest.

32:31.280 --> 32:35.082
Good, now go convince her.

32:40.923 --> 32:42.022
Wil!

32:42.024 --> 32:46.694
The Human girl I saw with
Amberle in my vision...

32:46.696 --> 32:48.662
was the Rover.

32:59.208 --> 33:01.275
Come to check out the view?

33:01.277 --> 33:03.978
There may be a way to win your freedom.

33:03.980 --> 33:05.045
So, you figured out I'm not

33:05.047 --> 33:07.815
the one who attacked you. Way to go.

33:07.817 --> 33:11.018
We need your help to
catch the real murderer.

33:11.020 --> 33:13.154
A Demon.

33:15.758 --> 33:17.925
And you want to use me as bait.

33:17.927 --> 33:21.028
It's either that or
face an Elvin court.

33:21.030 --> 33:22.596
And before you play
"Little Miss Innocent,"

33:22.598 --> 33:24.765
let's not forget that you
broke into the palace,

33:24.767 --> 33:28.669
assaulted Wil and stole the Elfstones.

33:28.671 --> 33:31.338
"Assaulted"?

33:31.841 --> 33:34.642
Is that what he told you?

33:34.977 --> 33:36.877
The details aren't important.

33:36.879 --> 33:38.212
He said you broke into his room.

33:38.214 --> 33:40.748
That he struggled, but
you knocked him out.

33:40.750 --> 33:43.951
That's one way to put it.

33:44.153 --> 33:46.687
But you should know that
the struggle was mutual

33:46.689 --> 33:49.323
and lasted about an hour.

33:52.628 --> 33:55.696
Well, he said you two weren't together.

34:00.136 --> 34:02.770
And he's absolutely right.

34:02.772 --> 34:05.105
Are you going to help or not?

34:11.647 --> 34:14.181
You'll be safe in here.

34:19.043 --> 34:21.344
Now what?

34:21.469 --> 34:23.170
We wait.

34:27.897 --> 34:32.166
The princess didn't seem
very happy to hear about us.

34:32.895 --> 34:35.395
There is no "us."

34:37.806 --> 34:40.174
Wow. You're such a guy.

34:40.176 --> 34:41.876
What's that supposed to mean?

34:41.878 --> 34:43.409
Seduce the girl, then drop her?

34:43.411 --> 34:45.679
Me? Seduce you?

34:45.681 --> 34:46.647
- Yeah.
- That's...

34:46.649 --> 34:49.116
Oh, that's...
You've got to be kidding me.

34:49.118 --> 34:51.784
No, I call it like I see it.

34:51.786 --> 34:53.721
You can't make me regret what happened

34:53.723 --> 34:56.190
any more than I already do.

34:57.927 --> 34:59.660
Well, I guess you're
really out of luck now.

34:59.662 --> 35:04.398
That princess won't want a
Rover's sloppy seconds.

35:05.845 --> 35:07.444
(door opens)

35:08.965 --> 35:11.138
A patrol just found the
body of a Blackwatch Guard

35:11.140 --> 35:12.673
hidden near the North Wall.

35:12.675 --> 35:15.276
He's been dead a couple of days.

35:15.478 --> 35:18.012
If the Changeling's been
hiding in the Blackwatch,

35:18.014 --> 35:20.381
it might know we're using a decoy.

35:20.383 --> 35:23.784
We have to warn Amberle!

35:29.392 --> 35:32.326
Open the doors! Open up!

35:34.196 --> 35:36.330
Amberle, are you okay?

35:37.233 --> 35:38.465
I'm fine, why?

35:38.467 --> 35:41.035
You're not safe here.

35:41.938 --> 35:43.938
It's okay.

35:45.074 --> 35:46.874
What's going on? Why
aren't you with Eretria?

35:46.876 --> 35:50.711
(distorted voice) Because
it's you I'm after!

35:53.249 --> 35:55.482
(gasps)

36:01.190 --> 36:02.140
Amberle!

36:02.165 --> 36:04.273
- Halt!
- Stand down!

36:21.812 --> 36:24.412
Burn the Demon and seal
its ashes in this.

36:24.414 --> 36:26.314
Yes, sir.

36:27.250 --> 36:30.752
If we're done here, I'll
just take my things and go.

36:30.754 --> 36:33.722
I'm afraid not. Commander Tilton,

36:33.724 --> 36:35.390
take the prisoner back to her cell.

36:35.392 --> 36:36.257
What are you doing?

36:36.259 --> 36:37.425
I don't make deals with Rovers.

36:37.427 --> 36:40.762
Oh, I knew an Elvin bitch
wouldn't keep her word.

36:40.764 --> 36:41.696
Let her go.

36:41.698 --> 36:43.098
This has gone far enough.

36:43.100 --> 36:47.302
You need to tell us what
you know, Princess.

36:48.308 --> 36:49.440
(Wil) Amberle...

36:49.873 --> 36:52.440
You saw Eretria in your vision.

36:53.410 --> 36:55.677
What are you talking about?

36:55.679 --> 36:57.679
Bandon told me when he touched you,

36:57.681 --> 36:58.913
he saw you and Eretria together.

36:58.915 --> 37:01.750
But I'm guessing you already
knew that, mind reader.

37:01.752 --> 37:03.318
I was hoping you were going to tell me

37:03.320 --> 37:05.286
of your own volition.

37:07.424 --> 37:09.924
Yes, she was in my vision.

37:10.694 --> 37:11.826
But I didn't know what it meant.

37:11.828 --> 37:13.028
I thought it might be a warning,

37:13.030 --> 37:14.696
and when she showed up and attacked me,

37:14.698 --> 37:15.463
that confirmed it.

37:15.465 --> 37:16.865
You need to start trusting the Ellcrys,

37:16.867 --> 37:20.835
otherwise the three of you
will not make it to Safehold.

37:20.837 --> 37:22.270
"Three"?

37:22.272 --> 37:25.340
Princess, Rover, Elf,
and Druid makes four.

37:25.342 --> 37:27.475
Allanon wasn't in my vision.

37:27.477 --> 37:29.744
If the Dagda Mor sends more Demons,

37:29.746 --> 37:31.446
we must be ready for them here.

37:31.448 --> 37:33.014
That is why you three...

37:33.016 --> 37:38.319
must travel to Safehold together.

37:58.975 --> 38:00.942
Do you recognize this?

38:01.878 --> 38:02.544
Go to hell.

38:02.546 --> 38:05.413
Oh, we might get there soon enough.

38:05.415 --> 38:06.047
"We"?

38:06.049 --> 38:07.949
I'm not going anywhere with you.

38:07.951 --> 38:09.918
Much as I'd love to see
you rot in that cell,

38:09.920 --> 38:12.954
the Ellcrys says you're
part of the quest.

38:12.956 --> 38:14.756
What the hell is an Ellcrys?

38:14.758 --> 38:17.459
Lover boy can fill you in.

38:18.528 --> 38:20.862
We can't do this without you.

38:20.864 --> 38:23.398
You are a Shannara, Wil.

38:23.400 --> 38:24.299
Never forget that.

38:24.301 --> 38:28.770
When you learn how to unlock
the power of the Elfstones,

38:28.772 --> 38:31.339
the Demons won't stand a chance.

38:31.341 --> 38:31.973
Yeah.

38:31.975 --> 38:35.477
It's not the Demons I'm worried about.

38:40.484 --> 38:42.951
I don't know about you, but...

38:42.953 --> 38:45.353
I'm feeling great about this plan.

38:45.355 --> 38:48.223
Move out!

39:04.341 --> 39:06.778
Don't worry. Daddy's coming.

39:20.190 --> 39:22.290
