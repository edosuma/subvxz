01:58.958 --> 02:00.458
In our line of work,

02:01.167 --> 02:02.667
the moment we wake up

02:02.958 --> 02:05.166
is like walking into another dream.

02:07.708 --> 02:09.874
We can't tell when we're truly awake.

02:10.875 --> 02:12.791
That's a dangerous thing

02:16.750 --> 02:19.125
you may wake up from a nightmare

02:19.833 --> 02:21.916
and realize that it
wasn't a dream after all.

02:26.875 --> 02:28.416
An older colleague once said,

02:29.417 --> 02:30.833
don't be afraid.

02:30.875 --> 02:33.000
Just remember who you are.

02:35.250 --> 02:36.791
I must remember...

02:38.708 --> 02:40.458
I'm a drug trafficker.

02:53.125 --> 02:53.958
Kai.

02:54.250 --> 02:56.166
Come over tonight. There's a job.

03:10.833 --> 03:11.833
Route number five.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.125
5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

03:30.458 --> 03:31.208
Pass.

03:31.209 --> 03:32.249
Get him, man.

03:32.833 --> 03:33.791
Do you have anything?

03:33.792 --> 03:34.375
No.

03:34.958 --> 03:35.874
Pass.

03:35.875 --> 03:36.875
Your turn.

03:41.542 --> 03:42.500
Time to work.

03:42.875 --> 03:43.791
Bin...

03:44.542 --> 03:45.542
Bin.

03:46.708 --> 03:48.874
Qiang, go to the same spot as last time.

03:49.042 --> 03:49.708
Sure.

03:49.792 --> 03:51.542
You, deliver to Mr. Hung
in Nanyang Village.

03:51.875 --> 03:52.875
Sure.

03:54.042 --> 03:56.458
Monkey, your delivery point
is a bit far this time.

03:56.667 --> 03:57.875
Okay, no problem.

03:59.167 --> 04:00.208
Kai,

04:00.292 --> 04:02.125
Nanjiang Village. Just follow the route.

04:04.542 --> 04:05.500
Don't screw up.

04:05.500 --> 04:06.250
No problem.

04:08.458 --> 04:09.458
Let's go.

04:14.917 --> 04:15.958
Get home safely.

04:16.208 --> 04:17.291
Thanks, Bin.

04:25.208 --> 04:26.374
Come on, follow my car down the mountain.

04:26.708 --> 04:27.416
Sure.

04:37.583 --> 04:38.916
They're off.

05:02.667 --> 05:03.958
Good luck.

05:06.917 --> 05:08.999
Traversing through a black-and-white blur

05:09.000 --> 05:10.041
You know

05:11.792 --> 05:13.707
Opening a new era

05:13.708 --> 05:14.708
I know

05:17.167 --> 05:20.125
I walk in the gale and the downpour

05:22.042 --> 05:25.125
Going against a deceptive illusion

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Stop.

05:41.208 --> 05:42.208
Turn off the ignition.

05:43.875 --> 05:44.666
You...

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Get out.

05:47.958 --> 05:48.999
What's wrong?

05:49.042 --> 05:49.958
Shut your mouth.

05:49.959 --> 05:50.999
Turn around.

05:51.917 --> 05:52.917
Hands on the car.

06:02.292 --> 06:03.333
Open it.

06:09.292 --> 06:10.333
What's this?

06:10.875 --> 06:11.957
I don't know.

06:11.958 --> 06:12.916
My boss put that in there.

06:12.917 --> 06:13.875
Your boss?

06:13.875 --> 06:14.875
Who's your boss?

06:15.167 --> 06:16.167
What boss?

06:16.333 --> 06:17.083
Forget about other people.

06:17.250 --> 06:19.208
You can explain yourself at the station.

06:32.542 --> 06:33.500
Get out of the car...

06:34.542 --> 06:35.542
Get out of the car...

07:49.792 --> 07:50.750
Where is he?

07:52.167 --> 07:53.125
He's gone.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.249
Call the captain.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.333
We'd agreed on two kilos

08:04.292 --> 08:05.999
and one man.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.166
What happened?

08:09.125 --> 08:11.458
I have multiple injured officers

08:11.625 --> 08:13.749
and two wrecked police cars!

08:13.750 --> 08:15.125
Are you messing with me?!

08:18.292 --> 08:20.124
I don't know what happened.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.291
Give me some time, I'll...

08:21.292 --> 08:22.708
Spare me the excuses!

08:23.792 --> 08:24.750
I'm telling you,

08:25.167 --> 08:28.000
I demand a bust right here, tonight!

08:32.167 --> 08:33.042
Sir,

08:34.125 --> 08:36.166
You should cut me some slack.

08:46.833 --> 08:48.374
If it wasn't for my protection,

08:50.042 --> 08:51.667
you'd be out of business.

09:12.625 --> 09:13.625
This volume

09:14.125 --> 09:15.583
should be enough for a decent bust.

09:17.875 --> 09:18.875
And the arrest?

09:20.125 --> 09:21.083
I'll arrange it.

09:26.208 --> 09:28.458
I told you to get a dummy for route five.

09:28.583 --> 09:30.583
Why did you change the plan?

09:30.750 --> 09:32.541
Why did you give it to Lin Kai?

09:32.625 --> 09:34.666
Do you know what a dummy is?

09:35.125 --> 09:37.208
Stupid... stupid...

09:39.125 --> 09:40.125
I'm sorry, Yi. It's my fault.

09:40.126 --> 09:41.625
What good does your sorry do?!

09:43.708 --> 09:46.166
Are you jealous of the kid?

09:46.583 --> 09:48.208
What era are you living in?

09:49.042 --> 09:51.332
Everything we do, we do for money.

09:51.333 --> 09:52.583
Do you get it?

09:52.792 --> 09:53.667
Yes, sir.

09:53.668 --> 09:55.708
Go find a scapegoat, right now!

09:55.750 --> 09:56.833
Yes, sir...

09:57.417 --> 09:58.417
<i>I...</i>

10:13.500 --> 10:14.583
You're still up?

10:54.167 --> 10:55.333
What do you want?

10:56.750 --> 10:58.166
What do you want?

10:58.333 --> 11:00.291
It was Yang Bin's idea.

11:01.500 --> 11:02.916
I didn't know a thing.

11:04.792 --> 11:06.375
Why should I believe you?

11:07.542 --> 11:09.333
I can sell anything...

11:10.625 --> 11:13.125
except those who can make money for me.

11:16.667 --> 11:18.292
I'm the same as you.

11:23.375 --> 11:25.083
I can kill anyone...

11:26.292 --> 11:28.333
except those who can make me rich.

12:33.083 --> 12:34.374
What happened?

12:35.708 --> 12:38.083
I think Cheng Yi may have been testing me,

12:38.750 --> 12:41.041
or maybe Yang Bin doesn't
like having me around.

12:43.750 --> 12:45.291
Then you have to be more cautious.

12:46.583 --> 12:49.416
The goal is to find Cheng's drug factory
as soon as possible.

12:51.542 --> 12:52.542
I know.

13:08.125 --> 13:09.416
Hang in there a little longer.

13:10.500 --> 13:12.833
I'll deal with Yang Bin as soon as I can.

13:14.208 --> 13:16.333
I think something fishy
is happening on my end, too.

13:21.542 --> 13:22.958
Watch your back.

13:24.625 --> 13:25.625
I will.

13:41.583 --> 13:42.624
Liu Haojun.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.291
We want to send a mole to infiltrate

13:46.292 --> 13:48.625
a drug cartel that's selling
high-purity heroin.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.083
This is an extremely dangerous mission.

13:56.417 --> 13:57.957
You can turn it down.

13:57.958 --> 13:58.791
However...

13:58.792 --> 14:00.500
if you do accept this mission.

14:00.958 --> 14:02.499
You'll be stripped of your badge

14:02.500 --> 14:04.249
and you'll live a new life
as a drug trafficker.

14:04.250 --> 14:05.500
I accept the mission.

14:08.792 --> 14:10.332
This is your new identity.

14:10.333 --> 14:11.624
From now on,

14:11.625 --> 14:13.166
your name is Lin Kai.

14:26.625 --> 14:27.916
Ying, Cheng Yi's here.

14:31.625 --> 14:32.791
Mr. Cheng.

14:32.792 --> 14:34.917
Ying, this is Lin Kai.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.666
He'll be handling your account from now on.

14:38.042 --> 14:39.583
Sure. No problem!

14:48.708 --> 14:49.541
Stop!

14:50.625 --> 14:51.666
Don't move!

14:51.958 --> 14:52.833
Freeze!

14:57.167 --> 14:59.000
This place bring in a lot of money for us.

14:59.042 --> 15:01.708
Build a good relationship with them.

15:03.917 --> 15:05.124
Wen

15:05.125 --> 15:07.125
<i>319p...</i>

15:07.708 --> 15:08.708
Freeze...

15:09.417 --> 15:10.500
Stop, or we'll fire!

15:23.583 --> 15:24.458
Mr. Cheng.

15:32.583 --> 15:33.333
Let's go.

15:33.417 --> 15:34.333
Yes, sir.

15:38.417 --> 15:39.250
Bao.

15:39.250 --> 15:40.208
This is Kai.

15:40.209 --> 15:41.541
Hi, Kai.

15:42.083 --> 15:44.666
He's taking over Yang Bin's turf.

15:44.667 --> 15:46.250
Sure, that's no problem.

15:46.708 --> 15:47.416
Hi, Kai,

15:47.417 --> 15:48.917
nice to meet you.

16:03.250 --> 16:05.291
This is our distribution plant.

16:05.667 --> 16:07.167
How much we'll sell

16:07.750 --> 16:09.125
depends entirely on you.

16:09.625 --> 16:10.625
Of course.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.791
We'll all make a fortune.

16:13.625 --> 16:14.791
It's all yours!

16:17.125 --> 16:18.125
I want some, too!

16:18.208 --> 16:19.416
She wants me!

16:23.125 --> 16:24.250
Good work.

16:24.958 --> 16:25.833
Keep it UP-

16:25.958 --> 16:26.999
I'm off.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.416
Okay. Take care.

16:34.000 --> 16:34.958
Kai.

16:37.583 --> 16:39.958
I'll show you the most important step
of the process.

16:46.792 --> 16:48.874
I've written down everyone
that Cheng Yi introduced me to.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.750
People, time, place.

16:51.667 --> 16:54.292
I now know how he moves every day.

16:55.958 --> 16:57.666
The factory is just for packing.

16:58.292 --> 16:59.583
Do you have anything else?

17:00.167 --> 17:01.333
I'll keep investigating.

17:18.625 --> 17:20.250
Nice one, Kai...

17:20.333 --> 17:23.207
I just taught you a lesson, didn't I?

17:23.208 --> 17:24.083
Bottoms up.

17:24.250 --> 17:26.665
Come on, bottoms up...

17:26.666 --> 17:28.750
Thanks, Kai.

17:32.417 --> 17:33.375
Kai.

17:35.042 --> 17:36.083
Cheers, Kai.

17:38.000 --> 17:38.875
I want money...

17:42.875 --> 17:45.083
Thanks, Kai...

18:59.375 --> 19:01.416
Mama...

19:02.042 --> 19:03.792
Mama...

19:06.917 --> 19:08.625
Mama.

19:25.292 --> 19:26.541
Hello, Yi.

19:26.542 --> 19:27.375
Kai.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.000
I'm at the door. Open up.

19:39.875 --> 19:40.875
Yi.

19:42.375 --> 19:43.500
What's wrong?

19:44.167 --> 19:45.250
Come with me.

20:02.500 --> 20:03.624
Open the trunk.

20:03.625 --> 20:05.082
Mr. Cheng.

20:05.083 --> 20:06.791
Get to work...

20:06.958 --> 20:08.208
Mr. Cheng.

20:08.583 --> 20:09.833
Let's move it.

21:21.917 --> 21:22.792
Hello?

21:22.917 --> 21:23.917
We got clear skies.

21:24.583 --> 21:25.416
Got it.

21:36.917 --> 21:37.917
Hurry UP-

21:38.625 --> 21:39.958
Get ready to move.

21:57.625 --> 21:59.000
Why don't you ask me where we're going?

22:00.583 --> 22:02.458
You'll tell me when you want to.

22:04.792 --> 22:07.291
Just follow my directions here on out.

22:07.292 --> 22:08.499
Remember that.

22:08.500 --> 22:09.625
Got it, Yi.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Wait for me here.

23:00.708 --> 23:02.333
Bear spotted. He's headed into the woods.

23:09.583 --> 23:11.124
Keep a close eye on him, number two.

23:34.583 --> 23:35.583
Mr. Luo.

23:37.750 --> 23:38.875
Don't worry, Mr. Luo.

23:39.542 --> 23:41.208
This kid is reliable.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
Mr. Luo.

23:52.875 --> 23:53.666
I'm telling you.

23:53.667 --> 23:54.917
Recently,

23:55.417 --> 23:56.750
business has been booming.

23:57.583 --> 24:00.083
We can barely keep up with demand.

24:01.125 --> 24:02.791
Have you found the man
that my boss asked for?

24:02.917 --> 24:04.083
I'm looking right now.

24:04.708 --> 24:06.958
I'll let you know when I have any news.

24:10.125 --> 24:11.333
You can count the money.

24:15.708 --> 24:16.708
Open it.

24:35.833 --> 24:37.124
26 packs in total.

25:15.917 --> 25:17.208
The best stuff we've got.

25:19.417 --> 25:20.292
Come on.

25:21.292 --> 25:22.292
Come on.

25:25.250 --> 25:26.125
Let's move.

25:45.458 --> 25:46.208
Stop!

25:46.208 --> 25:47.083
Freeze!

26:11.875 --> 26:12.875
Don't move!

26:54.000 --> 26:54.875
Don't move!

26:59.083 --> 26:59.916
Freeze!

27:32.417 --> 27:33.458
Get in. Hurry.

28:27.292 --> 28:28.417
I just saved your ass,

28:29.000 --> 28:30.291
and you're pointing a gun at me.

28:33.083 --> 28:34.083
Shut up.

28:34.958 --> 28:35.999
Keep driving.

28:44.125 --> 28:46.541
We had a hiccup.
Pick me up by the river.

28:54.125 --> 28:55.125
Stop here.

28:57.208 --> 28:58.208
Open the door.

29:06.375 --> 29:07.416
Walk.

30:09.583 --> 30:12.458
"Golden Triangle"

30:26.625 --> 30:27.375
Father.

30:27.583 --> 30:28.874
Dongfang is back.

30:28.875 --> 30:30.333
The money and the drugs are gone,

30:30.500 --> 30:33.083
but we've captured one of their men.

31:29.250 --> 31:30.208
Father.

31:48.375 --> 31:50.541
How long have you been
working for Cheng, kid?

31:51.417 --> 31:52.458
Three years.

31:53.750 --> 31:55.375
Who stole my drugs?

31:55.625 --> 31:56.958
I don't know, sir.

31:58.417 --> 32:00.208
Didn't Cheng say that the Yunlai police...

32:00.542 --> 32:01.333
has already been taken care of?

32:01.334 --> 32:02.666
How did the deal get screwed?

32:05.333 --> 32:07.374
He definitely sold us out.

32:11.083 --> 32:11.791
Sir,

32:11.792 --> 32:13.000
I really don't know what happened.

32:14.375 --> 32:15.958
If I do, I would've told you already.

32:18.250 --> 32:19.416
Don't shoot me, sir.

32:19.417 --> 32:20.167
Sir!

32:20.168 --> 32:21.791
I can get your money and your stuff back.

32:21.792 --> 32:23.500
I know all of Cheng's spots.

32:24.667 --> 32:26.458
I'm useful to you, sir.

32:26.708 --> 32:28.749
I can definitely help you find Cheng Yi.

32:41.375 --> 32:42.624
Work with me...

32:42.625 --> 32:43.666
I can, sir.

32:44.167 --> 32:45.749
Let's see what God has to say about that.

32:45.750 --> 32:46.958
What do you mean, sir?

32:52.750 --> 32:54.666
No, don't shoot me. Please.

32:54.792 --> 32:56.791
If you shoot me, you get nothing. Trust me.

32:56.792 --> 32:57.667
Have your men take me back,

32:57.668 --> 32:59.249
and I'll get your money
and your drugs. Okay?

32:59.250 --> 33:00.416
Please, sir!

33:13.167 --> 33:14.250
Kill me!

33:14.958 --> 33:16.666
Just kill me!

33:18.833 --> 33:19.958
What's your name?

33:22.292 --> 33:23.417
Lin Kai.

33:23.500 --> 33:25.708
Is that your real name, Lin Kai?

33:25.750 --> 33:26.750
It is.

33:42.458 --> 33:43.999
I'm sorry, father.

33:44.667 --> 33:46.500
Sit this one out.

33:47.042 --> 33:48.250
Let Qingshui go.

33:48.292 --> 33:49.333
Let me go.

33:49.625 --> 33:50.625
I can do this.

33:52.292 --> 33:54.000
Go with Dongfang.

33:54.833 --> 33:56.333
Don't screw this up.

34:19.708 --> 34:22.623
"Yunlai, China"

34:26.917 --> 34:28.498
This autumn,

34:28.500 --> 34:30.666
the Yunlai police took drastic action

34:31.417 --> 34:34.375
and seized shipments
of heroin that were smuggled into China.

34:34.500 --> 34:36.000
Our actions were successful.

34:36.417 --> 34:38.000
The results are clear.

34:39.458 --> 34:42.333
We must continue our hard work

34:42.708 --> 34:44.708
and eliminate the drug plague together

34:45.417 --> 34:46.708
once and for all.

34:58.417 --> 35:00.125
Look into this Wang Bo for me.

35:10.833 --> 35:13.416
The man in green with the
beanie works for me.

35:13.667 --> 35:15.417
He should know where Cheng Yi is.

35:18.667 --> 35:19.875
Do you want me to grill him?

35:25.500 --> 35:26.583
Don't try anything funny.

35:27.042 --> 35:28.417
I'm watching you.

35:54.542 --> 35:55.750
You're back, Kai?

35:59.125 --> 36:00.541
Didn't Me. Cheng say...

36:00.625 --> 36:02.208
that you were captured?

36:03.625 --> 36:04.625
Xiao Bei...

36:04.958 --> 36:06.458
You think you're the man now?

36:07.792 --> 36:08.958
What do you mean, Kai?

36:09.667 --> 36:11.416
The cops are looking everywhere for you.

36:11.417 --> 36:12.957
The cops are looking for me...

36:12.958 --> 36:14.999
and you wanted me to get caught, don't you?

36:15.000 --> 36:16.249
You want to be the boss, don't you?

36:16.250 --> 36:17.499
No... Kai.

36:17.500 --> 36:18.833
Didn't the drugs get seized?

36:19.208 --> 36:20.499
- It's mine.
- It's yours?

36:20.500 --> 36:21.666
It's my stash.

36:23.792 --> 36:24.792
Where did it come from?

36:24.792 --> 36:25.750
It's my own stash.

36:25.751 --> 36:27.208
- It's yours?
- It's mine.

36:27.500 --> 36:28.500
Are you playing me?

36:28.917 --> 36:29.625
Get up.

36:29.625 --> 36:30.500
I'm not messing with you.

36:44.958 --> 36:46.124
I'll ask you one more time.

36:46.542 --> 36:48.499
- I'm not messing with you.
- You're not?

36:48.500 --> 36:50.166
- Screw you.
- Kai.

36:50.500 --> 36:51.458
Get up.

36:51.667 --> 36:52.458
Come here.

36:57.625 --> 36:58.625
Xiao Pan.

36:59.542 --> 37:00.792
Trace this number.

37:01.542 --> 37:02.208
Sure.

37:02.500 --> 37:03.541
Is it Cheng Yi's?

37:03.542 --> 37:04.791
- It's not
- Are you sure?

37:04.792 --> 37:05.667
It really isn't.

37:06.708 --> 37:08.499
It's not. It's my stash.

37:11.542 --> 37:12.875
Are you trying to stir trouble?

37:13.500 --> 37:14.500
I got his location.

37:26.542 --> 37:27.583
Who is it?

37:28.875 --> 37:29.708
It's me.

37:29.709 --> 37:30.833
Lin Kai.

37:43.542 --> 37:44.583
Get out.

38:00.875 --> 38:02.208
You've got some balls,

38:03.000 --> 38:04.083
stealing from me.

38:04.542 --> 38:05.250
I didn't...

38:05.333 --> 38:06.541
that's not what happened, Mr. Luo.

38:06.542 --> 38:07.833
I was forced.

38:08.542 --> 38:09.624
If I didn't cooperate,

38:09.625 --> 38:11.208
they would've sent me to jail.

38:11.542 --> 38:12.542
Who?

38:13.583 --> 38:14.583
Mr. Luo,

38:14.750 --> 38:16.916
you might as well kill me.

38:17.875 --> 38:19.041
You're not gonna talk?

38:20.042 --> 38:21.749
No... Mr. Lu0... I'll talk...

38:21.750 --> 38:23.791
Wang Bo... it's Wang Bo.

38:25.625 --> 38:26.958
Our agreement was that

38:27.292 --> 38:28.958
I would get the money and the drugs.

38:29.250 --> 38:32.291
But I still haven't received a single cent.

38:38.667 --> 38:39.917
Call him.

38:40.625 --> 38:41.625
Set up a meet.

38:42.250 --> 38:43.333
I'll get your money for you.

38:50.667 --> 38:51.667
Stop.

38:55.958 --> 38:56.958
Who wants to talk first?

38:57.625 --> 38:59.125
It was his idea.

39:00.125 --> 39:01.750
He made up things

39:02.042 --> 39:03.917
and blackmailed me into stealing the drugs.

39:04.667 --> 39:06.916
I don't know anything beyond that.

39:06.917 --> 39:08.792
You coward,

39:09.375 --> 39:10.624
it was your idea all along.

39:10.625 --> 39:12.374
Now you're pinning everything on me.

39:12.375 --> 39:14.166
Give me back my share.

39:15.750 --> 39:17.000
Enough with the show.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.666
Where are my money and my drugs?

39:21.667 --> 39:22.792
He has it.

39:23.042 --> 39:24.333
I'm not lying.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.666
I really don't have it.

39:30.667 --> 39:32.125
I'll ask you one last time.

39:33.417 --> 39:35.833
Where are my money and my drugs?

39:36.667 --> 39:38.292
They're really in his hands.

39:40.125 --> 39:40.833
I really don't have it.

39:40.834 --> 39:42.332
I'm serious.

39:42.333 --> 39:44.041
We have a long-term partnership.

39:44.667 --> 39:47.125
Why would I do something this stupid?

39:47.792 --> 39:48.792
It's him.

39:48.793 --> 39:50.666
He wants a huge bust so
he can get a promotion.

39:50.667 --> 39:52.958
He forced me to work for him.

40:01.125 --> 40:03.832
We have a long-term partnership.
Why would I...

40:03.833 --> 40:06.333
If the police hears this,

40:06.708 --> 40:08.041
what will happen to you?

40:11.875 --> 40:13.707
A promotion or a funeral...

40:13.708 --> 40:15.041
Your choice.

40:20.875 --> 40:23.291
You have the money and the drugs?

40:36.125 --> 40:37.833
He really has everything?

40:38.458 --> 40:39.458
Yes.

40:42.417 --> 40:43.750
Then you're done here.

40:54.042 --> 40:55.833
You're one of us now.

41:01.083 --> 41:02.416
Clean this up.

42:07.292 --> 42:08.292
Alright.

42:08.417 --> 42:10.375
Everything's cleaned up now.

42:14.583 --> 42:16.291
Call your boss!

42:19.000 --> 42:20.333
Are you sure you want to do this?

42:34.375 --> 42:35.375
What's going on?

42:35.376 --> 42:36.541
Is everything taken care of?

42:39.083 --> 42:40.208
All taken care of.

42:42.042 --> 42:43.249
Everything you want

42:43.250 --> 42:44.916
is with me.

42:48.833 --> 42:49.874
Let's have a chat.

42:51.375 --> 42:52.291
Sure.

43:13.875 --> 43:14.708
Police!

43:14.708 --> 43:15.541
Don't move.

43:16.875 --> 43:17.875
What are you doing?

43:23.583 --> 43:24.333
Squat

43:27.250 --> 43:28.125
Captain.

43:42.917 --> 43:43.583
Captain.

43:45.125 --> 43:47.500
"Wait."

43:56.042 --> 43:58.125
"No Signal."

44:30.458 --> 44:31.458
What's going on?

44:38.500 --> 44:39.583
Kid,

44:40.167 --> 44:42.417
the drugs and the money
will set you for life.

44:42.708 --> 44:44.041
Why did you come back?

44:44.333 --> 44:46.499
I want to get to know you better.

44:46.958 --> 44:48.124
Besides, this small batch

44:48.125 --> 44:50.208
doesn't amount to much for me.

44:53.458 --> 44:55.374
You're a big shot from a big city.

44:55.375 --> 44:57.791
What can a small place
like this do for you?

44:59.458 --> 45:01.458
I want you to give me the
Greater China market.

45:12.042 --> 45:13.500
What can you give me for it?

45:13.667 --> 45:14.667
From now on,

45:15.083 --> 45:17.207
you won't just be selling ingredients.

45:17.208 --> 45:19.041
I'll arrange permits,

45:19.042 --> 45:20.957
customs, processing and sales.

45:20.958 --> 45:22.582
Anything that Cheng Yi didn't pay you for,

45:22.583 --> 45:23.707
I'll pay.

45:23.708 --> 45:25.541
I promise that your profit will spike.

45:33.583 --> 45:35.082
How can I trust you?

45:35.083 --> 45:36.583
The money and the drugs

45:37.125 --> 45:38.750
will be returned to you.

45:38.875 --> 45:40.416
Call it a joining fee.

45:40.542 --> 45:41.250
Okay.

45:42.375 --> 45:43.541
I trust you.

45:44.708 --> 45:46.291
Let's sit down and chat.

45:47.542 --> 45:48.667
Give me your gun.

45:51.042 --> 45:52.416
How do I know you won't kill me?

45:52.417 --> 45:53.292
Brother,

45:53.375 --> 45:55.291
this isn't how you repay my trust.

45:59.375 --> 46:01.041
I'm a businessman.

46:01.083 --> 46:02.041
A partnership

46:03.583 --> 46:04.749
is built on goodwill.

46:21.583 --> 46:23.666
"The Commander Star" has
left his First House.

46:23.958 --> 46:25.083
His life has run its course.

46:26.417 --> 46:27.750
It wasn't my call to make.

46:44.458 --> 46:45.666
Deputy Chief Wang.

46:49.125 --> 46:50.541
Come with us.

46:53.333 --> 46:54.333
Please.

47:23.167 --> 47:24.083
What's going on?

47:26.667 --> 47:28.083
Who sent you?

47:52.833 --> 47:54.166
Who are you?

48:01.292 --> 48:03.125
I told you already.

48:04.750 --> 48:06.250
I'm Lin Kai.

48:08.333 --> 48:10.208
I work for Cheng Yi.

48:10.583 --> 48:11.791
Right...

48:12.542 --> 48:14.458
You're a mole sent by the cops.

48:15.500 --> 48:18.083
Your grandpa sent me.

48:20.083 --> 48:22.166
You're the mole!

48:23.292 --> 48:25.250
My life is worth nothing anyway.

48:27.125 --> 48:29.583
Cut me. Kill me. Do whatever you want.

48:30.833 --> 48:32.374
If you don't want to work with me,

48:32.375 --> 48:33.833
then let me go.

48:35.083 --> 48:37.374
Then let's see if you can
get out of here alive.

48:57.792 --> 48:59.167
Yunan.

48:59.458 --> 49:01.166
Our chance is finally here...

49:38.292 --> 49:39.292
I've spoilt you.

49:40.500 --> 49:42.249
You're a a mole sent by the cops.

49:42.250 --> 49:44.291
You'll live a new life
as a drug trafficker.

49:44.292 --> 49:45.292
Undercover.

49:47.208 --> 49:48.374
Let's see if you can...

49:48.375 --> 49:50.375
Let's see if you can get out of here alive.

49:52.958 --> 49:55.333
From now on...

49:55.458 --> 49:57.541
your name is Lin Kai.

51:22.375 --> 51:23.708
An older colleague once said,

51:24.875 --> 51:28.291
don't be scared even if
you wake up in a nightmare.

51:28.625 --> 51:30.583
Just remember who you are.

51:32.417 --> 51:33.583
I must remember...

51:34.583 --> 51:35.916
My name is Lin Kai.

51:36.792 --> 51:38.083
I'm a drug trafficker.

52:39.417 --> 52:40.708
Who wants to play?

52:41.042 --> 52:45.542
I do, Father! I do...

52:48.458 --> 52:51.874
Rock, paper, scissors...

52:54.333 --> 52:57.041
Miss Qingshui is back!

53:01.750 --> 53:04.750
Miss Qingshui!

53:24.833 --> 53:26.708
These are my kids.

53:27.333 --> 53:30.583
I always make time to visit them.

53:34.750 --> 53:36.666
You look well.

53:39.750 --> 53:41.250
Since you're still alive,

53:41.583 --> 53:42.833
tell me about your plan.

53:44.917 --> 53:46.375
You're done asking about who I am?

53:49.042 --> 53:50.417
It doesn't matter who you are.

53:51.250 --> 53:52.250
Speak.

53:55.250 --> 53:56.666
I replace Cheng Yi.

53:57.250 --> 53:58.666
You supply the goods,

53:58.667 --> 53:59.750
everything else stays the same.

54:01.042 --> 54:02.292
How do we split the money?

54:05.333 --> 54:06.124
Fifty-fifty.

54:09.625 --> 54:11.000
Can you handle all that?

54:12.958 --> 54:14.041
If I can't handle it,

54:14.042 --> 54:15.250
would I have the balls to come here?

54:17.667 --> 54:18.417
But...

54:18.792 --> 54:20.917
I set the sales price.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.458
Seventy-thirty.

54:30.250 --> 54:31.583
It has to be fifty-fifty

54:31.958 --> 54:33.083
or forget about it.

54:34.625 --> 54:35.625
I promise you,

54:37.167 --> 54:38.917
your profits will go up exponentially.

54:41.125 --> 54:43.750
The big shot has a big mouth, too.

54:44.792 --> 54:46.458
Do you have the guts to give it a try?

55:01.792 --> 55:03.166
During your treatment,

55:03.167 --> 55:04.791
we were worried that you wouldn't make it.

55:04.792 --> 55:06.167
So we injected some morphine.

55:19.625 --> 55:21.833
We're both in the drug business.

55:24.708 --> 55:26.208
Take as much as you need.

57:59.875 --> 58:01.125
Stop pretending.

58:01.875 --> 58:03.791
I know who you are.

58:03.792 --> 58:05.208
Liu Haojun.

58:05.875 --> 58:07.207
I trust you.

58:07.208 --> 58:09.041
I know you'll complete your mission.

58:24.125 --> 58:25.000
Mama...

58:33.958 --> 58:34.958
Mama...

58:43.875 --> 58:45.625
It's Okay. Mama's here.

58:47.042 --> 58:49.625
I miss you.

58:51.375 --> 58:53.375
I can't stand this.

01:00:02.375 --> 01:00:03.875
Why did you help me?

01:00:30.958 --> 01:00:33.166
Don't let me see anything like this again.

01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:57.041
"No Signal."

01:01:44.917 --> 01:01:46.333
Our cost is high,

01:01:46.833 --> 01:01:48.833
but we don't have to worry
about surveillance.

01:01:49.333 --> 01:01:52.541
To turn a seed into Double Eagle heroin

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:53.792
takes only three months.

01:01:56.833 --> 01:01:58.166
I don't care...

01:01:58.833 --> 01:01:59.999
about the process.

01:02:02.375 --> 01:02:04.041
I only care about the business.

01:02:08.125 --> 01:02:09.125
Sure.

01:02:09.917 --> 01:02:11.250
Money's important.

01:03:02.958 --> 01:03:03.958
Get closer.

01:03:15.167 --> 01:03:16.624
I'm in the Golden Triangle.

01:03:16.625 --> 01:03:17.833
Will get in touch when I have a chance.

01:03:20.208 --> 01:03:21.249
Let's go.

01:03:59.958 --> 01:04:01.124
The permits have been signed.

01:04:02.292 --> 01:04:03.542
They will last you for a month.

01:05:56.333 --> 01:05:57.333
Feeling better?

01:06:10.792 --> 01:06:11.792
HOW long?

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:16.583
Don't worry about me.

01:06:17.792 --> 01:06:19.333
We have to abort the mission.

01:06:19.958 --> 01:06:21.124
You're in way over your head.

01:06:21.375 --> 01:06:23.083
You think I want to be an addict?!

01:06:24.125 --> 01:06:25.458
They're controlling me with this!

01:06:25.542 --> 01:06:26.707
If I quit, then it's over!

01:06:26.708 --> 01:06:28.124
That's the price I pay!

01:06:46.125 --> 01:06:47.291
I can quit it.

01:06:48.083 --> 01:06:49.124
Don't worry.

01:07:00.833 --> 01:07:01.874
Alright.

01:07:03.833 --> 01:07:06.291
I'm in contact with the core figures
in the Golden Triangle

01:07:07.167 --> 01:07:08.458
He's letting me take Cheng Yi's place.

01:07:09.042 --> 01:07:11.124
The whole town is planted with jammers.

01:07:11.125 --> 01:07:12.416
GPS is useless there.

01:07:13.208 --> 01:07:15.041
The border is surrounded by guards.

01:07:16.542 --> 01:07:18.792
There's no phone service
and no internet in town.

01:07:19.333 --> 01:07:22.249
Only Eagle and a few of his men
have satellite phones.

01:07:25.125 --> 01:07:26.125
What's his name?

01:07:28.167 --> 01:07:29.167
Eagle.

01:07:30.292 --> 01:07:31.417
Impossible.

01:07:32.375 --> 01:07:33.458
What do you mean?

01:07:39.625 --> 01:07:40.791
Ten years ago,

01:07:42.292 --> 01:07:44.750
We had in a joint operation with Interpol.

01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:48.250
I was like you.

01:07:49.417 --> 01:07:51.792
I infiltrated a drug cartel
in the Golden Triangle.

01:07:52.583 --> 01:07:54.458
The head of that drug cartel

01:07:55.375 --> 01:07:56.458
was also named Eagle.

01:07:59.375 --> 01:08:01.083
We conducted a raid.

01:08:02.208 --> 01:08:03.666
But during the arrest...

01:08:03.667 --> 01:08:04.833
there was an accident.

01:08:10.708 --> 01:08:12.624
Our car exploded.

01:08:13.542 --> 01:08:15.250
It went up in flames.

01:08:22.250 --> 01:08:23.707
Could it be the same man?

01:08:29.125 --> 01:08:29.791
No.

01:08:29.792 --> 01:08:30.792
That's impossible.

01:08:32.375 --> 01:08:33.416
But...

01:08:34.667 --> 01:08:36.125
production of heroin of such high purity

01:08:37.332 --> 01:08:39.499
must have something to do
with his old associates.

01:08:44.582 --> 01:08:45.582
Haojun.

01:08:47.625 --> 01:08:48.582
Your next step...

01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:51.207
is to get their exact location.

01:08:51.875 --> 01:08:53.999
We'll set up a joint
operation with Interpol

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.250
and catch them all in one go.

01:08:58.707 --> 01:08:59.582
Got it.

01:09:21.792 --> 01:09:23.792
Pray for a change of fortune.

01:09:24.167 --> 01:09:25.957
Pray for the eradication of illnesses.

01:09:26.250 --> 01:09:30.625
Be free of danger and misfortune.
Live long in peace.

01:09:30.875 --> 01:09:34.875
Be humble and gracious.
Respect your elders.

01:09:35.292 --> 01:09:39.792
Then you shall be rewarded with
life, beauty, happiness, health.

01:09:44.332 --> 01:09:46.457
You may place your flowers on the altar.

01:10:20.625 --> 01:10:21.625
My wife.

01:10:22.167 --> 01:10:24.208
Today is her birthday.

01:10:31.583 --> 01:10:33.208
You've done a good job in China.

01:10:34.292 --> 01:10:35.375
The elders...

01:10:35.458 --> 01:10:37.041
have taken an interest in you.

01:10:38.792 --> 01:10:41.333
Come meet them tonight.

01:10:41.625 --> 01:10:42.541
Sure.

01:11:40.958 --> 01:11:43.458
Everyone.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.500
The man who helped

01:11:46.958 --> 01:11:48.333
Double Eagle

01:11:49.375 --> 01:11:51.125
multiply its profits

01:11:52.375 --> 01:11:54.083
is this big city kid.

01:11:54.917 --> 01:11:56.292
His name is Lin Kai.

01:12:03.542 --> 01:12:04.958
I like young talents

01:12:05.708 --> 01:12:07.208
who are smart and capable.

01:12:12.792 --> 01:12:15.125
Accomplishments must be rewarded.

01:12:15.792 --> 01:12:18.500
Misdeeds must be punished.

01:12:19.125 --> 01:12:20.791
Have you made accomplishments or misdeeds?

01:12:22.125 --> 01:12:23.874
That's not for me to decide.

01:12:23.875 --> 01:12:25.458
You'll have to ask Eagle.

01:12:47.917 --> 01:12:48.917
Double Eagle

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.333
has heroin of the highest

01:12:51.583 --> 01:12:54.499
purity and quality in Southeast Asia.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.208
Because of our expertise in our formula.

01:12:59.833 --> 01:13:03.833
That's how we rule the world.

01:13:06.250 --> 01:13:07.541
However,

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.583
a new player has emerged.

01:13:19.167 --> 01:13:20.667
It's called...

01:13:21.250 --> 01:13:23.000
methamphetamine.

01:13:23.458 --> 01:13:24.583
Also known as ice.

01:13:24.792 --> 01:13:27.750
This thing earns
three times more profit than heroin.

01:13:29.625 --> 01:13:31.541
Should we give it a try?

01:13:33.375 --> 01:13:35.875
Planting is our expertise.

01:13:36.250 --> 01:13:37.875
Growing poppies is one thing.

01:13:38.167 --> 01:13:41.583
What do we know about chemistry?

01:13:42.042 --> 01:13:43.292
We can always learn.

01:13:44.042 --> 01:13:46.500
We went from the field to hydroponics,

01:13:46.875 --> 01:13:49.000
and we're still standing, aren't we?

01:13:49.708 --> 01:13:50.708
Exactly.

01:13:51.333 --> 01:13:52.374
It's impossible!

01:14:03.708 --> 01:14:05.499
Reality can be cruel.

01:14:07.250 --> 01:14:08.583
To be frank...

01:14:10.958 --> 01:14:12.499
we're working

01:14:12.708 --> 01:14:14.624
in a declining industry.

01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:18.708
I think it's worth a try.

01:14:19.917 --> 01:14:21.875
The South American gangs
own the ice business.

01:14:23.250 --> 01:14:24.541
How can we touch it?

01:14:24.958 --> 01:14:26.249
Don't you all think so?

01:14:30.250 --> 01:14:31.250
Boss“.

01:14:31.251 --> 01:14:32.333
Let's drop it...

01:14:32.708 --> 01:14:33.666
for now.

01:15:02.292 --> 01:15:03.125
Boss.

01:15:03.875 --> 01:15:05.166
Did you call me in this early

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:06.500
for something urgent?

01:15:31.958 --> 01:15:32.833
Let's go.

01:15:38.375 --> 01:15:39.333
Father.

01:15:41.333 --> 01:15:42.166
Are you Okay?

01:15:42.542 --> 01:15:44.167
Did you drink too much last night?

01:15:47.125 --> 01:15:48.583
Everyone was having fun.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.707
The elders have given the green light.

01:15:52.708 --> 01:15:54.041
You'll be in charge of the ice deal.

01:15:54.042 --> 01:15:56.208
Get us some Ephedra.

01:15:57.250 --> 01:15:58.541
I can do that.

01:16:00.542 --> 01:16:03.375
But Ephedra is banned in China.

01:16:03.583 --> 01:16:05.916
I'll need permits from at least
five departments to bring it here.

01:16:05.917 --> 01:16:07.917
The police will be our biggest hurdle.

01:16:12.667 --> 01:16:15.875
Don't we have Wang Bo in
the police department?

01:16:18.083 --> 01:16:19.666
Wang Bo's pay grade is too low.

01:16:20.208 --> 01:16:22.249
He won't be able to pull it off.

01:16:26.375 --> 01:16:28.083
You mean this deal

01:16:28.542 --> 01:16:29.542
isn't going to work?

01:16:33.958 --> 01:16:35.624
We have the money and the people.

01:16:36.625 --> 01:16:38.500
Why can't we just grow it ourselves?

01:16:40.583 --> 01:16:41.916
I can't wait any longer.

01:16:42.250 --> 01:16:43.125
We have to hurry.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.541
What's the rush?

01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:51.583
Come here.

01:17:23.958 --> 01:17:25.499
The man in there...

01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:27.125
his name is Zhang Haitao.

01:17:30.125 --> 01:17:33.500
My wife and child died at their hands.

01:17:35.792 --> 01:17:39.625
I know that he worked with
the man who sold me out.

01:17:40.167 --> 01:17:42.541
He was the one I trusted the most.

01:17:42.542 --> 01:17:44.291
I couldn't believe that

01:17:44.292 --> 01:17:45.625
he'd betray me.

01:17:46.792 --> 01:17:47.792
That day,

01:17:49.125 --> 01:17:52.125
they finally had a chance to arrest me.

01:18:14.667 --> 01:18:15.750
Freeze. Police!

01:18:24.542 --> 01:18:25.833
You traitor.

01:18:48.792 --> 01:18:49.792
Yunann.

01:19:00.583 --> 01:19:01.583
Are you Okay?

01:19:02.125 --> 01:19:03.125
I'm fine.

01:20:21.875 --> 01:20:23.125
Pull him out.

01:20:23.375 --> 01:20:24.875
Pull him Out!

01:20:35.042 --> 01:20:36.875
I've tortured him for ten years.

01:20:37.708 --> 01:20:39.749
And I've kept him alive for ten years.

01:20:39.875 --> 01:20:41.666
Of course I can't just let him die!

01:20:42.292 --> 01:20:43.333
I know

01:20:43.875 --> 01:20:46.083
that God sent him to help me.

01:20:54.375 --> 01:20:56.041
Help me find a man in China.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.416
To save him, this man

01:21:00.417 --> 01:21:01.667
will get us the Ephedra.

01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:03.875
Who do you want me to find?

01:21:06.667 --> 01:21:08.375
I only know him as Huasheng.

01:21:10.875 --> 01:21:11.875
Huasheng?

01:21:15.375 --> 01:21:16.375
No problem.

01:21:28.792 --> 01:21:31.042
Why didn't you hand the map to Eagle?

01:21:38.708 --> 01:21:39.541
Do you know

01:21:39.542 --> 01:21:40.707
why circus elephants

01:21:40.708 --> 01:21:42.541
just sit around all day

01:21:42.542 --> 01:21:44.042
and let people order them around?

01:21:45.083 --> 01:21:47.208
Because they were tamed at a young age.

01:21:47.417 --> 01:21:48.417
Whoever tries to escape

01:21:48.418 --> 01:21:49.750
will get beaten.

01:21:50.167 --> 01:21:51.417
When they become adults,

01:21:51.792 --> 01:21:53.875
even though they're no longer shackled,

01:21:54.042 --> 01:21:55.333
they don't dare to escape.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.582
Of course, if elephants want to run

01:21:57.583 --> 01:21:59.041
who can physically stop them?

01:22:00.792 --> 01:22:02.833
They just lack the courage to leave.

01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:08.041
The world is a huge place.

01:22:09.375 --> 01:22:10.916
You can run away in any direction.

01:22:17.208 --> 01:22:18.208
Tomorrow,

01:22:19.083 --> 01:22:20.374
run in that direction.

01:22:20.958 --> 01:22:22.583
Fly away like a bird.

01:22:25.333 --> 01:22:26.416
Don't be scared.

01:22:43.125 --> 01:22:44.125
Target in sight.

01:23:14.958 --> 01:23:16.333
Help me find a cop.

01:23:17.208 --> 01:23:18.916
He used to be called Huasheng.

01:23:20.542 --> 01:23:22.333
He's an old friend of my boss.

01:23:22.542 --> 01:23:23.874
Dig up Huasheng

01:23:23.875 --> 01:23:25.958
and ask him to get Ephedra for us.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.374
Haven't you had enough?

01:23:29.375 --> 01:23:31.208
Spare me the crap.

01:23:33.292 --> 01:23:35.042
Go and find the man.

01:23:36.458 --> 01:23:37.957
I've never heard of this man.

01:23:37.958 --> 01:23:39.999
HOW Will I find him?

01:23:46.250 --> 01:23:48.041
When you go back,

01:23:48.667 --> 01:23:49.792
tell them that Zhang Haitao is still alive.

01:23:50.625 --> 01:23:53.041
Huasheng will naturally
come looking for you.

01:23:57.792 --> 01:24:00.500
I really don't know what
you're talking about.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.791
Zhang Haitao is still
alive after ten years.

01:24:04.667 --> 01:24:05.792
Do you hear me?

01:24:12.083 --> 01:24:13.083
Are you Okay?

01:24:13.708 --> 01:24:15.041
I'm fine.

01:24:56.708 --> 01:24:57.708
I've found him.

01:25:04.292 --> 01:25:05.208
Jianguo,

01:25:05.292 --> 01:25:06.750
how's the mission going?

01:25:07.250 --> 01:25:08.583
Everything is going as planned.

01:25:09.083 --> 01:25:11.082
This is an important mission.

01:25:11.083 --> 01:25:12.541
You must handle it with caution.

01:25:12.708 --> 01:25:14.249
We can't afford a single misstep.

01:25:15.542 --> 01:25:16.417
I understand,

01:25:17.167 --> 01:25:19.708
but I can't let my partner
endure any more suffering.

01:25:19.917 --> 01:25:22.167
Don't do anything rash.

01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:24.416
We'll definitely catch Eagle this time.

01:25:25.250 --> 01:25:26.083
But...

01:25:27.667 --> 01:25:29.208
no matter how difficult it'll be,

01:25:29.708 --> 01:25:32.083
I won't let my partner suffer any longer.

01:25:32.583 --> 01:25:33.749
When I come back,

01:25:34.083 --> 01:25:35.791
I'll report everything to you

01:25:36.583 --> 01:25:39.124
and I'll accept any penalty
from the department.

01:26:11.167 --> 01:26:12.750
Allow me to introduce...

01:26:13.542 --> 01:26:15.250
the Huasheng you've been looking for.

01:26:15.792 --> 01:26:18.167
This is Lin Kai, the man
who's been looking for you.

01:26:18.667 --> 01:26:19.958
Now that you're both here...

01:26:20.875 --> 01:26:22.166
I'm done.

01:26:22.167 --> 01:26:23.167
I'm off.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:25.875
Wait.

01:26:26.292 --> 01:26:27.292
Take a seat.

01:26:33.167 --> 01:26:33.833
Father,

01:26:34.625 --> 01:26:36.291
we have the man you're looking for.

01:26:42.625 --> 01:26:43.500
Hello...

01:26:44.792 --> 01:26:46.208
He Chaosheng...

01:26:47.292 --> 01:26:49.333
ls Zhang Haitao alright?

01:26:56.667 --> 01:26:57.833
He's doing fine.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.625
Just slightly stronger than a cripple.

01:27:20.208 --> 01:27:23.666
You should be grateful that
I've taken care of him for ten years.

01:27:25.042 --> 01:27:26.292
Let him go.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.625
Isn't it time that we speak face to face?

01:27:40.083 --> 01:27:41.124
You...

01:27:41.125 --> 01:27:42.582
have to come get him.

01:27:42.583 --> 01:27:45.083
I don't have time to send him to you.

01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:48.500
Wait.

01:27:50.125 --> 01:27:52.332
That undercover cop next to you...

01:27:52.333 --> 01:27:53.416
kill him.

01:27:56.875 --> 01:27:59.374
Then come here alone.

01:27:59.375 --> 01:28:00.583
I'm waiting for you.

01:28:01.792 --> 01:28:02.667
Fine.

01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:05.375
Here.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Let's go.

01:28:20.001 --> 01:28:21.375
Take me to Eagle.

01:29:11.292 --> 01:29:12.292
His signal is gone.

01:29:28.542 --> 01:29:29.832
Search the place again.

01:29:29.833 --> 01:29:31.374
Leave no one alive.

01:29:31.583 --> 01:29:32.583
Got it.

01:30:35.208 --> 01:30:36.249
How's it going?

01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:40.750
Huasheng.

01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:44.750
How have you been?

01:30:52.792 --> 01:30:55.208
I can't believe we're meeting again.

01:30:57.583 --> 01:30:58.583
Where is he?

01:31:00.375 --> 01:31:01.416
What's the rush?

01:31:03.083 --> 01:31:04.541
I've waited ten years for you.

01:31:04.792 --> 01:31:06.458
Cut the crap. Where is he?

01:31:40.958 --> 01:31:42.291
I kept him alive for ten years

01:31:42.792 --> 01:31:44.458
so that you would come back.

01:31:48.833 --> 01:31:49.833
Yunan,

01:31:51.417 --> 01:31:54.958
I can finally give closure
to you and our child.

01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:16.791
The heartless bastard
left you for dead ten years ago.

01:32:19.542 --> 01:32:21.625
Now you have a chance at revenge.

01:32:22.750 --> 01:32:24.000
Take two shots at him.

01:32:29.042 --> 01:32:31.082
If the shots don't kill him,

01:32:31.083 --> 01:32:32.291
then God has spoken.

01:32:33.292 --> 01:32:34.500
You can take him home.

01:32:36.042 --> 01:32:37.542
If you don't take the shots,

01:32:39.208 --> 01:32:41.249
then both of you have to stay here.

01:32:42.292 --> 01:32:44.042
You'll do ten more years.

01:32:44.208 --> 01:32:45.416
How's that sound?

01:33:08.708 --> 01:33:09.957
How can you cheat?

01:33:09.958 --> 01:33:12.208
How dare you cheat?!

01:33:14.917 --> 01:33:16.208
That's one shot.

01:33:16.250 --> 01:33:17.125
One more!

01:33:26.208 --> 01:33:27.166
Fire!

01:33:57.167 --> 01:33:58.000
It's back!

01:35:19.958 --> 01:35:20.833
Father.

01:35:21.417 --> 01:35:22.542
Take my wife home.

01:38:50.583 --> 01:38:51.416
Captain.

01:38:53.083 --> 01:38:53.958
Are you alright?

01:38:55.625 --> 01:38:56.583
Let's go.

01:39:15.417 --> 01:39:16.542
Get in the car.

01:39:48.542 --> 01:39:49.583
I'll drive!

01:45:58.417 --> 01:45:59.500
How's that?!

01:46:20.333 --> 01:46:21.041
Kai.

01:46:21.042 --> 01:46:23.000
I'm fine. Leave!

01:46:36.208 --> 01:46:36.958
Get him out of here!

01:46:36.958 --> 01:46:37.916
We leave together!

01:46:38.042 --> 01:46:39.333
Go. That's an order!

01:49:04.667 --> 01:49:05.667
How's that?

01:49:15.250 --> 01:49:16.250
How's that?

01:49:17.042 --> 01:49:18.042
Father.

01:49:21.250 --> 01:49:22.166
Father.

01:49:26.208 --> 01:49:27.458
Please let him go.

01:50:44.833 --> 01:50:45.874
Tomorrow,

01:50:46.750 --> 01:50:48.250
run in that direction.

01:50:48.708 --> 01:50:50.333
Fly away like a bird.

01:50:54.292 --> 01:50:55.333
Don't be scared.

01:51:16.417 --> 01:51:17.833
No matter how difficult it'll be,

01:51:19.708 --> 01:51:22.833
I won't let my partner suffer any longer.

01:51:26.875 --> 01:51:29.166
We must...

01:51:29.500 --> 01:51:31.666
bring Eagle to justice this time.

01:52:00.375 --> 01:52:01.375
Captain...

01:52:01.583 --> 01:52:02.583
Captain.

01:52:02.917 --> 01:52:03.917
Don't fall asleep.

01:52:06.583 --> 01:52:07.583
Hang in there.

01:52:07.875 --> 01:52:08.875
We're almost there.

01:52:09.208 --> 01:52:10.916
I'll get you home.

01:52:32.917 --> 01:52:34.250
Target spotted.

01:52:34.375 --> 01:52:36.750
East longitude 100 degree 24 point.

01:52:37.292 --> 01:52:39.625
North latitude 20 degree <i>23</i> point.

01:54:07.167 --> 01:54:08.707
Recently, the Chinese police force

01:54:08.708 --> 01:54:11.666
cracked a large-scale drug case
in the Golden Triangle.

01:54:11.667 --> 01:54:13.875
A major drug cartel has been dissolved

01:54:14.667 --> 01:54:18.167
and a police official is under
investigation for alleged corruption.

01:54:18.875 --> 01:54:22.332
Wang Bo, Deputy police chief
in the city of Yunlai,

01:54:22.333 --> 01:54:23.374
is accused of violating the law

01:54:23.375 --> 01:54:25.416
and has been under police custody.

01:54:25.750 --> 01:54:27.666
Wang is charged with abusing his authority,

01:54:27.667 --> 01:54:29.917
and providing assistance to criminals.

01:54:30.333 --> 01:54:33.333
An investigation by prosecutors
revealed that Wang and...

01:54:35.625 --> 01:54:36.833
Captain Li Jianguo

01:54:37.167 --> 01:54:38.625
traded his life

01:54:38.875 --> 01:54:40.333
to save the life of his partner.

01:54:40.708 --> 01:54:43.041
He lived up to his oath
as a police officer.

01:54:43.833 --> 01:54:45.082
He showed the world

01:54:45.083 --> 01:54:46.083
the Chinese police force's resolve

01:54:46.084 --> 01:54:48.458
to rid the world of illegal drugs.

01:54:48.875 --> 01:54:50.374
As long as illegal drugs
exist in the world,

01:54:50.375 --> 01:54:51.874
our efforts to fight it

01:54:51.875 --> 01:54:53.541
will not stop for a second.

01:54:54.042 --> 01:54:55.500
We salute you.

01:55:09.875 --> 01:55:12.041
In this operation, Li Jianguo

01:55:12.208 --> 01:55:14.708
openly defied his superiors' orders.

01:55:14.875 --> 01:55:18.416
However, he bravely sacrificed his life
to save a fellow officer.

01:55:18.542 --> 01:55:20.417
That's something that every
officer should learn.

01:55:21.125 --> 01:55:24.208
I hope that you will inherit
his professionalism.

01:55:24.417 --> 01:55:27.625
Keep serving your country and your people

01:55:28.042 --> 01:55:31.625
by becoming a better police officer.

01:55:46.792 --> 01:55:49.083
We have a new mission for you.

01:55:49.500 --> 01:55:50.458
Are you ready?

01:55:51.083 --> 01:55:52.166
Anytime, sir.

01:55:52.583 --> 01:55:53.416
I'm ready to go.
