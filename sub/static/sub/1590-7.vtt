06:04.898 --> 06:07.632

06:07.634 --> 06:09.501

They could have their
own apples to enjoy.

06:11.638 --> 06:13.638

could even help

06:13.640 --> 06:14.873
The rest of your orchard.

06:14.875 --> 06:18.410
The vampire bats don't eat
the seeds of the apples

06:18.412 --> 06:19.478
And when they
spit them out,

06:19.480 --> 06:22.681

productive apple trees.
