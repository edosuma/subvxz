<i>Go! Go!</i>

34:31.102 --> 34:33.804
(Bleep)

34:33.806 --> 34:37.274
When you're up there, hundreds
of kilometres from anything,

34:37.276 --> 34:40.677
<i>you can't rely on somebody</i>
<i>else; it's all you.</i>

34:42.280 --> 34:44.915
If you get stuck,
I mean you have no choice

34:44.917 --> 34:47.484
but to get yourself out of it.

34:48.986 --> 34:51.455
Come on! Come on!

34:53.891 --> 34:55.158
(Thuds)

34:56.294 --> 34:58.528
Come on, roll!

35:02.133 --> 35:03.400
Oh yeah!

<i>Narrator:</i>
<i>Mike clears the hummock,</i>

35:05.604 --> 35:09.106
<i>but added rear weight from</i>
<i>the extended arm is too much.</i>

<i>Narrator:</i>
<i>And the trailer rolls</i>
<i>right back into trouble.</i>

35:13.445 --> 35:15.112
(Thuds)

35:19.650 --> 35:21.718
Mike:
Come on, baby!

35:25.456 --> 35:26.857
Yes!

35:29.894 --> 35:32.129
Think I got 'er.

35:33.231 --> 35:33.964
(Clinks)

35:36.767 --> 35:40.370
I'm going to try to repair this
road by hand best I can.

35:40.372 --> 35:42.439
(Shovelling dirt)

35:47.678 --> 35:49.946
Gives you an idea of what
we're driving on, here.

35:49.948 --> 35:53.250
It's frozen muskeg.

35:53.252 --> 35:56.186
(Clinks on shovel)
Hard as a rock.

35:56.188 --> 35:59.923
<i>These guys spend a lot of time</i>
<i>trying to prepare this road</i>
<i>for the season;</i>

35:59.925 --> 36:01.758
<i>hopefully this hole</i>
<i>will be okay.</i>

36:01.760 --> 36:03.326
We've got to stick together
out here

36:03.328 --> 36:05.996
and ensure that we make
each other's trips

36:05.998 --> 36:08.331
as best as possible
for one another.

36:08.333 --> 36:12.602

36:17.475 --> 36:19.242
(Exhales)

36:19.244 --> 36:21.945
Let's see if this worked.

36:21.947 --> 36:24.514
<i>Here we go!</i>

36:24.516 --> 36:30.020
<i>Narrator:</i>
<i>He's still got 50 rugged miles</i>

(Honks)
Mike: Woo! Yeah baby!

36:36.794 --> 36:38.695
<i>These roads are terrible.</i>

36:38.697 --> 36:40.297
It's like driving
on a motocross track

36:40.299 --> 36:43.033
in a semi-truck,
hauling a load.

36:44.368 --> 36:46.903

(Bleep)

36:53.579 --> 36:55.745
Diggity (bleep) doo!

36:55.747 --> 36:57.314
That's a hidden one.

36:58.482 --> 37:00.650
(Truck rumbles)

37:02.086 --> 37:05.689
<i>This is definitely a slow</i>

37:16.367 --> 37:17.834
<i>Narrator:</i>
<i>Finally...</i>

37:17.836 --> 37:20.604
Well, we're in Shamattawa.

37:20.606 --> 37:23.506
<i>I'm going to go and offload.</i>

37:24.775 --> 37:29.012

37:29.014 --> 37:30.914
(Airbrakes hiss)

37:30.916 --> 37:33.717
<i>Mike:</i>
<i>The load made it just fine.</i>

37:33.719 --> 37:36.419
<i>Narrator:</i>
<i>And on his very first solo run,</i>

37:36.421 --> 37:40.056
<i>The winter roads rookie</i>

37:40.058 --> 37:42.292
<i>Mike:</i>
<i>I think Mark really put me</i>
<i>to the test</i>

37:42.294 --> 37:47.230
<i>hauling that large excavator</i>
<i>on a super low trailer.</i>

37:47.232 --> 37:50.634
At this point my confidence
is sky high.

37:50.636 --> 37:54.304
I think everyone's gonna
be pretty impressed.

37:55.473 --> 37:57.741
<i>Another one bites the dust.</i>

37:57.743 --> 38:01.645
After that trip, I'm pretty
much ready to take on anything.

38:01.647 --> 38:03.380
(Door shuts)

38:11.122 --> 38:15.191
ake...

38:17.094 --> 38:19.029
Todd:
Mark's really counting on me
to get this thing up there,

38:40.319 --> 38:41.351
<i>I know they're important,</i>

38:41.353 --> 38:44.087

<i>what a pain in the ass.</i>

38:47.558 --> 38:51.127
Finally here.
Holy smokes, man.

38:53.230 --> 38:55.398
Narrator:
With the government contract
fulfilled,

38:55.400 --> 38:58.835
it opens up new possibilities
for Polar.

38:58.837 --> 39:01.504

Perfect! Woo!

39:13.752 --> 39:15.552
Another (bleep) load delivered,

39:15.554 --> 39:17.153
another paycheque signed.

39:17.155 --> 39:18.555
<i>More loads to people.</i>

39:18.557 --> 39:20.857
That's what this is
all about up here.

39:24.395 --> 39:28.064
<i>Narrator:</i>
<i>As daylight falls,</i>
<i>over 400 miles away...</i>

39:32.870 --> 39:35.839
It's a long ways in here, Lisa.

39:35.841 --> 39:37.874
What, are you in a hurry
or something?

39:37.876 --> 39:41.678
<i>Darrell:</i>
<i>We just need to get this load</i>
<i>in and get it delivered.</i>

39:41.680 --> 39:45.849
<i>Narrator:</i>
<i>The competition's driving</i>
<i>through the night.</i>

39:45.851 --> 39:47.150
I'm hauling a loader,

39:47.152 --> 39:49.386
and it's to unload
the transformers

39:49.388 --> 39:52.522
that Darrell has,
to Deer Lake.

39:52.524 --> 39:57.460
<i>They're all waiting, so a lot</i>
<i>of people have a lot invested</i>
<i>into it.</i>

39:57.462 --> 40:01.698
<i>Narrator</i>
<i>Darrell and Lisa are hauling</i>
<i>their biggest contract yet,</i>

40:01.700 --> 40:08.338

<i>You've gotta make</i>
<i>a good reputation,</i>

40:09.474 --> 40:13.042
<i>make a good name for yourself.</i>

40:13.044 --> 40:15.879
<i>This road right here is huge</i>
<i>for our business.</i>

40:15.881 --> 40:18.281
<i>Best paying contract we've</i>
<i>had so far this year,</i>

40:18.283 --> 40:20.750
we just need to get 'em
unloaded safe

40:20.752 --> 40:24.421
and on the ground, hooked up,
get power back to Deer Lake,

40:24.423 --> 40:26.756
<i>and we're outta here.</i>

What is goin' on here?

40:36.934 --> 40:39.002
(Airbrakes hiss)

40:42.273 --> 40:43.740
Darrell, I just pulled up here.

40:43.742 --> 40:45.108
I can't figure out
what's going on.

40:45.110 --> 40:47.977
There's a bunch of trucks
stopped right here.

40:47.979 --> 40:50.213
<i>Darrell:</i>
<i>I see that.</i>

40:51.816 --> 40:53.883
(Airbrakes hiss)

40:55.753 --> 40:57.687
Want to check it out?

40:57.689 --> 40:59.889
Yeah I suppose, there's a lot
of people standing up there.

40:59.891 --> 41:01.357
<i>I don't know what's goin' on.</i>

41:01.359 --> 41:03.026
Yeah, we're on a tight
schedule,

41:03.028 --> 41:05.061
so we've got to get this
thing moving.

41:05.063 --> 41:06.496
Darrell:
Yeah, copy that.

41:06.498 --> 41:09.265
Ain't nothing we can do when
they're blocking the road,
though.

41:15.139 --> 41:18.708
This looks like one of those
little ice bridge things.

41:20.277 --> 41:22.278
So what's goin' on?

41:22.280 --> 41:24.113
Bridge just had that dip in it.

41:24.115 --> 41:26.983
Is it broken, like uncrossable
type broken?

41:26.985 --> 41:29.219
No, it was just filled it in.
It would have been broken.

41:29.221 --> 41:31.054
Filled it up, watered it down,
freeze it back up.

41:31.056 --> 41:32.388
Yeah, left in the end.

41:32.390 --> 41:34.390
You don't have too many
nights of freezin' left.

41:34.392 --> 41:36.326
Is it good to go across, then,
or...?

41:36.328 --> 41:39.863
We're trying to get these
transformers to where
they're going.

41:45.569 --> 41:46.903
With these warm temperatures
we've been having,

41:46.905 --> 41:49.072
it's the only way to keep
the road open, you know.

41:49.074 --> 41:51.875
This bridge goes,
not going anywhere, so.

41:51.877 --> 41:53.877
Darrell:
All right, thanks.

41:53.879 --> 41:56.546
If it ain't one thing,
it's another, huh.

41:56.548 --> 41:59.616
(Water rushes)

41:59.618 --> 42:01.718
<i>Lisa:</i>
<i>They're repairing this</i>
<i>ice bridge thing,</i>

<i>so they said there's a hole</i>
<i>in it,</i>

42:03.054 --> 42:04.487
<i>and they gotta water it down.</i>

42:04.489 --> 42:06.189
They can't let us cross
'til it freezes up.

42:06.191 --> 42:07.624
We've got some warm
temperatures,

42:07.626 --> 42:10.593
and water doesn't freeze in
warm temperatures very well.

42:10.595 --> 42:12.862
<i>Narrator:</i>
<i>The haul could be</i>
<i>the highest price tag</i>

42:12.864 --> 42:16.366
<i>in the history</i>

<i>But with the ice bridge</i>
<i>shut down,</i>

<i>and the transformers due</i>
<i>in just a few hours,</i>

42:22.541 --> 42:27.544
<i>Darrell and Lisa's fortunes</i>
<i>may have just melted away.</i>

42:27.546 --> 42:31.281
<i>Darrell:</i>
<i>This is what kills the company,</i>

42:31.283 --> 42:32.448
We can't sit here all night.
