that's the best you can do."

17:48.032 --> 17:51.825
Okay. This one I call
the twisted dolphin.

17:51.919 --> 17:53.466
Ooh, head above water!
Head above the water!

17:53.557 --> 17:54.758
- [ Laughs ]
- Whoo.

17:54.849 --> 17:57.664
Hey, maybe I'll get a
scholarship for water ballet.

17:57.750 --> 17:58.899
[ Laughing ]
Oh, yeah.

17:59.022 --> 18:00.256
[ Both laugh ]
See, Sue?

18:00.343 --> 18:02.130
This is what I'm talking about.

18:02.365 --> 18:04.059
No 17-year-old kid
should be

18:04.146 --> 18:06.843
stressing out the way
you've been lately.

18:06.930 --> 18:07.958
There's plenty of time for that

18:08.047 --> 18:10.365
when you're destroying
your boss's dental business.

18:10.450 --> 18:11.520
[ Chuckles ]

18:12.233 --> 18:13.299
[ Chuckles ]
Mm-hmm.

18:14.388 --> 18:15.861
- Mmm.
- Ahh.

18:15.923 --> 18:17.178
You know what's funny?

18:17.363 --> 18:20.356
You are the complete
opposite of Axl.

18:20.444 --> 18:23.634
I swear, that kid
never worried about college.

18:23.761 --> 18:25.123
I mean, I had to stay on him

18:25.209 --> 18:26.772
to make sure
every little thing got done.

18:26.878 --> 18:30.090
But you-- I mean,
you're always pushing yourself.

18:30.175 --> 18:31.830
That's because I have to.

18:32.081 --> 18:34.304
I mean, it's just hard for me.

18:34.554 --> 18:37.207
I mean, I-I'm not
super-smart like Brick.

18:37.327 --> 18:39.698
I'm not an athlete like Axl.

18:39.829 --> 18:42.034
I mean, yeah,
I-I've made a couple of teams,

18:42.147 --> 18:43.816
but I don't know
if you know this.

18:43.920 --> 18:46.037
Some of them
I made by accident.

18:46.424 --> 18:49.005
I am just right in the middle.

18:49.108 --> 18:52.231
I'm the middle in my grades,
the middle on teams,

18:52.331 --> 18:56.090
the middle child...
the middle everything.

18:56.240 --> 18:57.912
If I were on
the college admissions board,

18:58.038 --> 18:59.718
why would I pick me?

18:59.959 --> 19:01.881
I don't stand out in any way.

19:02.118 --> 19:04.411
I am completely average.

19:04.490 --> 19:07.750
Sue... listen to me.

19:08.427 --> 19:10.446
You know how much
I worry about you?

19:11.383 --> 19:13.625
This much.
You know why?

19:14.031 --> 19:15.046
Because you have something

19:15.144 --> 19:17.911
I have never seen
in any other person.

19:17.997 --> 19:22.300
When stuff happens to you,
you bounce.

19:22.927 --> 19:23.712
Really?

19:23.819 --> 19:26.721
Yeah.
And that's huge.

19:27.390 --> 19:30.249
It's something I've always
admired about you.

19:30.885 --> 19:33.177
Now, listen, I'm not saying
everything comes easy for you.

19:33.280 --> 19:35.089
If it did,
you wouldn't be my kid.

19:35.286 --> 19:38.064
But the one thing I do know is

19:38.157 --> 19:41.698
that you have
so many amazing qualities

19:41.812 --> 19:45.525
that can't be measured
by the SATs.

19:45.725 --> 19:47.504
Do you know what I am, mom?

19:47.608 --> 19:48.308
Hmm?

19:48.644 --> 19:51.996
I am indefatigable.

19:52.091 --> 19:53.638
Yes, you are.

20:07.684 --> 20:09.528
<i>Sometimes, they frustrate you.</i>

20:10.169 --> 20:11.671
You know,
when you think about it,

20:11.770 --> 20:14.403
this whole thing started
because of my mean math teacher.

20:14.601 --> 20:16.003
I think you two should talk.

20:16.217 --> 20:17.397
I'll set it up.

20:20.137 --> 20:21.710
<i>Sometimes, they inspire you.</i>

20:21.903 --> 20:24.155
I got the Optimist's
Scholarship!

20:24.230 --> 20:25.585
It's for $100!

20:25.701 --> 20:28.718
[ Gasps ] I can't believe
they picked <i> me.</i>

20:28.815 --> 20:31.048
Aah! The world
is such a special place.

20:31.133 --> 20:33.077
I can hardly wait
for the next moment!

20:33.161 --> 20:35.625
<i>And sometimes, they eat you</i>
<i>out of house and home.</i>

20:35.699 --> 20:37.595
I feel so much stronger now
that we put on all that weight.

It's good to see you,

Well, I would have
been here sooner.
