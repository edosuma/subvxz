00:27.236 --> 00:29.987
The Itchy and Scratchy Show!

00:32.616 --> 00:35.410
Tee one up for me, catty.

00:35.494 --> 00:37.286
Sure thing, mousy.

00:42.292 --> 00:45.044
Nice follow-through!

00:46.088 --> 00:49.507
Now that's what I call a moon shot.

00:55.639 --> 00:58.850
Now that's what I call a moon shot.

00:58.934 --> 01:00.727
Dad, that line was in the cartoon.

01:00.811 --> 01:02.311
I'm pretty sure it wasn't.

01:02.396 --> 01:07.734
Our phone bill is $400! They
charged us for a call to Brazil.

01:07.818 --> 01:09.235
Boy, did you make a
prank call to Brazil?

01:09.319 --> 01:10.403
No, sir. I didn't.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.280
Choke on your lies!

01:15.284 --> 01:18.369
Homer, they must've made a mistake.

01:18.454 --> 01:21.914
We'll just go down to the phone
company and straighten it out.

01:21.999 --> 01:25.001
Which phone company?
There are hundreds of them.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.211
And they all keep changing their names.

01:29.506 --> 01:30.965
I think we're with Comquaaq.

01:31.049 --> 01:32.759
No, I think its Niagular.

01:32.843 --> 01:35.470
No, last week they became Vertiqual.

01:44.021 --> 01:47.231
Wow. Everything is so high-tech.

01:47.316 --> 01:50.359
Dialing Murray
Hill, 5-6-3-0-9.

01:50.444 --> 01:53.529
So, I says to Myrna, I
says, "That guy's a bum!"

01:55.157 --> 01:58.493
Ooh! That's the Movie Phone guy.

01:58.577 --> 02:01.037
The movie we've selected
plays at 8:00 p. m.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.623
at Springfield Cinema Six.

02:03.707 --> 02:05.792
Thank you for dating Mr. Movie Phone.

02:05.876 --> 02:09.086
Our evening will be
rated R, for brief nudity.

02:09.170 --> 02:10.420
Ma'am, would you be interested in

02:10.506 --> 02:12.423
changing your
long-distance service if...

02:12.508 --> 02:14.300
What the...

02:14.384 --> 02:17.595
She hung up on me! What did I do?

02:21.892 --> 02:24.769
Hello. I'm your customer
service rep, Lindsay Naegle.

02:24.853 --> 02:26.813
We've met you many times, Miss Naegle.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.648
Why do you keep changing jobs?

02:28.732 --> 02:29.941
I'm a sexual predator.

02:30.025 --> 02:31.025
Oh.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.319
Now, how may I best
dispense with you today?

02:33.403 --> 02:36.531
We've been charged for calls
to Brazil that we didn't make.

02:36.615 --> 02:39.033
We are not paying this bill.

02:39.117 --> 02:41.452
Fine. I'll cut off your service.

02:41.578 --> 02:44.497
Fine! I'll cut off your ponytail! Homer!

02:44.581 --> 02:46.874
Marge, it's called negotiating.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.963
Ooh. Fascinating.

02:53.507 --> 02:56.259
I need to call Janie, but
I can't get a dial tone.

02:56.343 --> 03:00.179
We're not paying our bill, so the
phone company shut off our service.

03:00.264 --> 03:02.974
Why must you fight with every utility?

03:03.058 --> 03:07.520
I told you, I have too
much time on my hands.

03:07.604 --> 03:11.107
Homer. We were cleaning out
a cooling duct at the plant

03:11.191 --> 03:13.276
and found a box of old taco shells.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.862
Oh, why didn't you call me?

03:15.946 --> 03:17.864
We tried, but a recording said

03:17.948 --> 03:20.449
you were a bunch of deadbeats. Mmm.

03:20.826 --> 03:25.997
That's it! They have
awoken a sleeping giant.

03:26.290 --> 03:28.708
Homer, what are you going to do?

03:28.792 --> 03:30.543
Crazy scheme, crazy
scheme, crazy scheme.

03:30.627 --> 03:33.129
Get me tools and beer! Yes!

03:34.423 --> 03:36.841
Free service, here we come.

03:36.925 --> 03:39.552
All right. Let's try the red one.

03:41.388 --> 03:44.307
Okay. I'll try the green.

03:47.853 --> 03:50.897
Let's try the red one
again. Oh, not again!

03:53.775 --> 03:55.735
Let's try them together.

04:01.450 --> 04:02.700
Maybe the red one.

04:09.291 --> 04:10.416
How did I get here?

04:10.500 --> 04:12.251
We found you smoldering in the bushes.

04:12.336 --> 04:16.380
That's it! We're just going to
have to pay for that call to Brazil!

04:16.464 --> 04:17.964
What call to Brazil?

04:18.050 --> 04:20.216
The one I didn't make
and Marge didn't make

04:20.302 --> 04:23.137
and Bart didn't make and
hence, no one in the house made.

04:23.430 --> 04:24.430
Uh-oh.

04:24.514 --> 04:26.557
You made that call?

04:26.642 --> 04:28.434
But you're the good one.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.394
Yeah. The one we both like.

04:30.479 --> 04:31.854
Why did you do it?

04:32.022 --> 04:33.397
Please don't be mad.

04:33.482 --> 04:36.317
I've been sponsoring
an orphan boy in Brazil.

04:36.401 --> 04:42.114
Oh, aren't you sweet? Sharing your
allowance with a poor Brazilian boy.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.076
Don't you know the boys from
Brazil are little Hitlers?

04:45.160 --> 04:48.788
I saw it in a movie, whose
name I can't remember!

04:48.872 --> 04:50.957
Ronaldo used to send
me a letter every month,

04:51.041 --> 04:52.458
but then they stopped.

04:52.542 --> 04:55.711
That's why I called the orphanage.
But they said he disappeared.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.673
How come you talked for $400?

04:58.757 --> 05:02.051
Well, then they started
pressuring me for more donations,

05:02.135 --> 05:04.387
and you can't hang up on a nun.

05:04.471 --> 05:07.974
That's right. They have powers.

05:09.226 --> 05:10.810
When I sent my first donation,

05:10.894 --> 05:12.561
the charity mailed me this video.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.651
Hi, Lisa. Thank you for your donation.

05:18.735 --> 05:21.654
Because of your generosity,
I bought sturdy shoes

05:21.738 --> 05:24.365
that will last for a thousand sambas!

05:27.911 --> 05:29.161
Aw!

05:29.246 --> 05:33.124
He's so adorable. Can
we have another baby?

05:33.208 --> 05:36.669
No way! I still haven't lost the
weight I put on from the last one.

05:36.753 --> 05:40.881
And with the money left over, the
orphanage was able to buy a door.

05:40.966 --> 05:43.342
Now the monkeys cannot bite me.

05:43.427 --> 05:44.593
Uh-oh.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.768
I am like sugar to them.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.104
Oh.

05:55.188 --> 05:58.524
That poor little boy.
We've got to find him.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.234
How many people live in Brazil?

06:00.318 --> 06:02.653
A hundred and fifty-six million. D'oh!

06:03.071 --> 06:05.197
Well, we've got to find him!

06:05.991 --> 06:08.034
What? I'm really concerned.

06:09.161 --> 06:11.203
Fine. I want to meet monkeys.

06:11.288 --> 06:14.874
I don't know. It's awfully
expensive to fly to Brazil.

06:14.958 --> 06:17.209
Not if we buy our
tickets on the Internet.

06:17.294 --> 06:18.836
It's really cheap if we change planes

06:18.920 --> 06:21.255
in Phoenix, Honolulu, Sun
City and East Saint Louis,

06:21.339 --> 06:24.050
spend a night in a haunted
house and leave right now.

06:24.134 --> 06:27.720
Then it's settled. The
Simpsons are going to Brazil!

06:27.804 --> 06:29.722
And I'll have been on every continent.

06:29.806 --> 06:31.432
Except Antarctica.

06:31.516 --> 06:36.812
The Simpsons are going to Antarctica
next year. This year, Brazil.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.528
Okay, here are some travel tips.

06:44.613 --> 06:46.238
"Only drink bottled water.

06:46.323 --> 06:48.657
"Don't get into an unlicensed taxi.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.911
"And remember, they have
winter during our summer. "

06:51.995 --> 06:55.456
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
So, in August, it's cold?

06:55.707 --> 06:59.001
That's right. And in February, it's hot?

06:59.086 --> 07:00.086
Mmm-hmm.

07:00.170 --> 07:05.424
So, it's opposite land! Crooks
chase cops, cats have puppies.

07:05.509 --> 07:07.343
No, Dad. It's just the weather.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.220
So, hot snow falls up?

07:09.304 --> 07:11.514
Yes. Woo-hoo!

07:15.769 --> 07:19.105
Get ready, Brazil. I
now speak fluent Spanish.

07:19.272 --> 07:24.068
Well done, Bart. But in
Brazil, they speak Portuguese.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.615
Forget every word, boy. It's useless.

07:29.699 --> 07:32.284
But, Homer... I said forget it!

07:36.289 --> 07:37.289
All gone.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.917
This is your captain speaking.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.919
The local temperature in Rio de Janeiro

07:42.003 --> 07:45.798
is hot, hot, hot, with
100% chance of passion!

07:46.216 --> 07:48.801
Fernando, you make that joke every time.

07:48.885 --> 07:52.304
It was that joke that made
you fall in love with me.

07:54.933 --> 07:57.768
Hey, Maggie, how are
you doing back there?

08:02.983 --> 08:04.942
Oh, so helpless.

08:07.779 --> 08:11.866
Look, it's the giant statue
of Christ on Corcovado.

08:11.950 --> 08:17.163
Wow. It's like he's on the
dashboard of the entire country.

08:17.247 --> 08:21.208
It says here we can get anywhere
we want by taking a conga line.

08:21.376 --> 08:22.668
Way ahead of you, Marge.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.255
Take me to the hotel

08:26.339 --> 08:30.342
My hands are on a guy's ass
Boy, this dude must work out

08:34.431 --> 08:36.765
Hey! Hey!

08:42.272 --> 08:44.899
Boy, they sure love soccer here.

08:44.983 --> 08:46.567
Kick it!

08:52.032 --> 08:54.074
Goal!

08:54.159 --> 08:56.285
Look, Marge. I'm Brazilian!

09:00.207 --> 09:02.458
"How to Loot Brazil"?

09:02.584 --> 09:04.793
I got it! I got it! I got it!

09:13.637 --> 09:16.055
Bart, what are you watching?

09:16.139 --> 09:17.097
Kids' show.

09:28.860 --> 09:31.862
Bert and Ernie left
it to your imagination.

09:31.947 --> 09:33.614
Look, the room came with a fruit hat.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.407
Hey, and a mini bar hat!

09:35.492 --> 09:38.452
I'm Chiquita Banana and I'm here to say

09:38.536 --> 09:41.747
I will eat this Toblerone
and I will not pay

09:43.708 --> 09:46.585
Guys! While you're singing and dancing,

09:46.670 --> 09:49.713
somewhere out there Ronaldo
is waiting to be found.

09:49.798 --> 09:53.467
There he is! Oh, wait.
You said brown hair, right?

09:55.887 --> 09:57.930
What a charming neighborhood.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.057
Mom, these are slums.

10:00.141 --> 10:02.017
The government just
painted them bright colors

10:02.102 --> 10:03.852
so the tourists wouldn't be offended.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.020
Works for me.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.355
Yeah. Check out the rats.

10:08.566 --> 10:10.693
Ooh! They look like Skittles!

10:10.777 --> 10:11.944
Here we are!

10:12.028 --> 10:13.696
"123 Papaya Street. "

10:13.780 --> 10:15.364
This is Ronaldo's orphanage.

10:17.158 --> 10:20.160
Excuse me. We're looking
for this little boy.

10:20.245 --> 10:23.956
Ah, yes. Ronaldo. He
went out months ago.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.208
And we haven't heard from him since.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.544
Every day we light a candle for him.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.379
Have you tried looking for him?

10:30.463 --> 10:31.672
That's plan B.

10:31.756 --> 10:33.674
We're never going to find him.

10:35.051 --> 10:37.219
Now, Lisa, it's not as bleak as that.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.805
Can you fly me over
town to look for him?

10:40.724 --> 10:42.308
We nuns cannot fly.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.393
Oh, too much junk in the trunk, eh?

10:44.477 --> 10:45.477
Yes.

10:50.275 --> 10:53.569
Have some meat on a sword,
Lisa. It'll cheer you up.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.656
You know I'm a vegetarian.

10:57.741 --> 10:59.325
But you're on vacation, honey.

10:59.409 --> 11:01.285
I'm not wearing my wedding ring.

11:01.369 --> 11:02.453
Homer!

11:02.537 --> 11:05.956
Okay. On this map I marked all the
places that Ronaldo liked to go.

11:06.041 --> 11:08.500
If we split up, we should
be able to search them all.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.463
We'll do our best. Now, let's get going!

11:13.673 --> 11:15.174
Check, please.

11:15.258 --> 11:16.717
Si!

11:19.262 --> 11:20.637
Does that include tip?

11:20.722 --> 11:21.930
Si!

11:23.058 --> 11:26.977
Hey, look. There's Copacabana
beach! The heart and soul of Rio!

11:33.068 --> 11:34.693
Excuse me, Americans!

11:34.778 --> 11:36.362
How did you know?

11:38.281 --> 11:41.867
There is a dress code on this
beach. But we can help you.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.788
I feel so European.

11:46.456 --> 11:49.166
Huh. Mine keeps disappearing.

11:50.627 --> 11:51.752
Oh, well.

11:54.631 --> 11:57.549
Oh, I hope they're going somewhere good.

11:57.634 --> 12:00.010
Okay, boy. Let's strut our stuff.

12:00.095 --> 12:01.637
I'm in Rio

12:01.721 --> 12:05.015
and I'm walking on the
beach I'm in my Speedo

12:11.022 --> 12:13.899
No! No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

12:21.449 --> 12:24.660
Excuse me. We think
this boy might be here.

12:24.744 --> 12:28.080
Okay, this is a samba school.
This is not a lost and found.

12:29.749 --> 12:33.460
This is where we invented
the lambada and the macarena.

12:33.545 --> 12:38.257
We are now developing our most
powerful dance, the penetrada.

12:38.341 --> 12:41.135
It makes sex look like a church!

12:41.219 --> 12:44.304
I don't think my
daughter should hear this.

12:44.389 --> 12:48.684
You can't protect her
forever! You stupid lady!

12:52.313 --> 12:56.442
Give me a drink with all your sweetest
Brazilian fruits mixed together.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.195
Here you go.

13:02.574 --> 13:05.951
Sweet. Sweet. Sweet!

13:12.000 --> 13:15.043
There's got to be a million kids
here. We'll never find Ronaldo.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.879
Ronaldo? You know him?

13:16.963 --> 13:20.841
No, no. I was just distracting
you while my children robbed you.

13:24.596 --> 13:28.098
Oh, look at all the stuffed coatimundi.

13:28.183 --> 13:30.309
I bet Maggie would like one.

13:32.937 --> 13:35.272
I'll just get her this bracelet.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.026
Everything here is something.

13:39.861 --> 13:42.446
Hey, Bart. How many more
places do we have to search?

13:42.530 --> 13:44.323
Just one, and it's across town.

13:44.407 --> 13:45.866
Taxi!

13:48.578 --> 13:51.914
My American friend, I'm afraid
that this is a kidnapping.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.500
So that means I don't
have to pay the fare?

13:54.584 --> 13:56.418
I suppose... Woo-hoo!

13:56.503 --> 13:58.170
I'm afraid you don't appreciate

13:58.254 --> 14:00.339
the seriousness of the situation.

14:00.423 --> 14:03.550
Fine. Take me, but let the boy go!

14:03.635 --> 14:06.011
I'm afraid he has already gone.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.111
Where are you taking me?

14:23.196 --> 14:26.323
Shut up. And take that
stupid bag off your head.

14:26.407 --> 14:28.909
No. It smells like cinnamon.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.994
Behold, the Amazon.

14:31.079 --> 14:33.455
But quick because we're burning it down.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.123
Listen, I really need a rest stop.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.500
Again?

14:36.584 --> 14:39.044
I have a bladder the
size of a Brazil nut.

14:39.128 --> 14:40.754
We just call them nuts here.

14:45.009 --> 14:46.343
Suckers.

14:48.012 --> 14:49.221
Suckers!

14:51.933 --> 14:55.394
I guess planning a vacation
around a missing kid

14:55.478 --> 14:57.938
is not the way to have fun.

14:58.022 --> 14:59.106
Hey.

15:00.692 --> 15:04.069
Time for Brazil's favorite
kids' show, Teleboobies.

15:05.321 --> 15:10.117
Clockwise! Counter-clockwise.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.744
Where's your father?

15:12.829 --> 15:14.246
Kidnapped.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.748
Oh, my God! What are we supposed to do?

15:16.833 --> 15:18.792
I don't know. Wait for the call.

15:18.876 --> 15:23.839
On top of. Beneath.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.633
So, you want me to find your husband?

15:26.718 --> 15:27.759
Yes.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.636
And you also want me
to find a little boy?

15:29.721 --> 15:30.762
That's right.

15:30.847 --> 15:33.265
I don't think there
is a boy or a husband!

15:33.349 --> 15:35.684
I think you have a thing for me.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.062
I've been shot!

15:39.981 --> 15:42.274
I am flattered, but I
do not swing that way.

15:43.109 --> 15:44.651
I have another itch.

15:44.736 --> 15:46.570
Yeah, well, scratch it yourself.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.322
I'm not going there again.

15:48.406 --> 15:50.407
I have sent the ransom note.

15:50.491 --> 15:55.162
If your family wants to see you alive
again, they would be wise to pay.

15:55.246 --> 15:59.041
I don't know. They've been seeing
me alive for free for a long time.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.338
So, have you got the $50,000?

16:04.631 --> 16:08.925
Well, with all our savings
and the money Grampa wired us,

16:09.010 --> 16:11.094
we have $1,200.

16:11.304 --> 16:14.890
That's very nice, honey. That'll buy you

16:15.391 --> 16:18.727
one of my legs or something
they call a mystery bag.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.103
I'll get back to you.

16:20.188 --> 16:21.730
They have $1,200.

16:21.814 --> 16:25.984
$1,200? You've already eaten that much.

16:26.069 --> 16:27.903
Come on. I didn't...

16:29.614 --> 16:30.656
Well, maybe.

16:30.740 --> 16:32.866
Enough of your blarney! Get the money!

16:34.535 --> 16:35.535
Ahoy-hoy.

16:35.745 --> 16:38.288
Mr. Burns, it's Homer Simpson.

16:38.373 --> 16:41.291
I've been kidnapped and I need $50,000.

16:41.376 --> 16:46.213
Hmm. Well, I'm high on sheep
embryos, so I am feeling charitable.

16:46.297 --> 16:49.007
How about I advance you the
money and you work it off?

16:49.092 --> 16:50.300
No deal!

16:52.929 --> 16:55.972
Moe's Tavern. Home of the
stinkiest rag in America!

16:56.057 --> 16:57.349
Hey, Moe.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.976
Homer, listen. I need 50
grand. Don't ask me why.

17:00.103 --> 17:01.937
No, no. I need 50 grand!

17:02.230 --> 17:03.522
I asked you first!

17:03.606 --> 17:06.273
Fine. I'll send you 50 grand. Thanks.

17:07.819 --> 17:09.736
Hello, Flanders. I need 100 grand.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.570
Well, I don't really have that much.

17:11.656 --> 17:15.325
But if you need it that
bad, you'll be in my prayers.

17:15.410 --> 17:16.992
Go suck a Bible!

17:21.624 --> 17:23.040
This is all my fault.

17:23.126 --> 17:26.086
I came to find someone, but
now I've just lost Dad and...

17:26.170 --> 17:28.171
What is that noise?

17:28.256 --> 17:31.883
That irritating,
intoxicating music with a beat

17:31.968 --> 17:33.927
that sends your inhibitions packing?

17:34.011 --> 17:35.387
It's Carnival!

17:43.896 --> 17:46.565
Oh, your father would've loved this.

17:46.649 --> 17:49.901
The drunkenness, the
ambiguous sexuality...

17:51.112 --> 17:53.447
I've got to get out of here!

17:54.365 --> 17:58.994
You cannot run from Carnival! Because
even running is a kind of dance!

17:59.078 --> 18:02.122
I am on fire, and I dance!

18:02.707 --> 18:05.792
I'll just dance and
worry at the same time.

18:15.261 --> 18:18.388
Hey, look! It's the
stripper from the kids' show.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.641
She makes paying attention cool.

18:26.022 --> 18:28.231
Lisa! Lisa!

18:30.276 --> 18:31.610
It's me, Ronaldo!

18:31.861 --> 18:33.111
Ronaldo!

18:33.196 --> 18:35.614
Yes. I am Flamenco Flamingo.

18:35.740 --> 18:39.034
And it all started with the
dancing shoes you bought me.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.410
Why didn't you tell me?

18:40.495 --> 18:41.620
I tried to write.

18:41.704 --> 18:44.122
But I didn't know what
state you lived in.

18:44.207 --> 18:46.249
It's a bit of a mystery, yes.

18:46.334 --> 18:49.628
But if you look at the
clues, you can figure it out.

18:49.712 --> 18:53.673
Oh, no! The parade, she
starts. Meet me at the estudio.

18:53.758 --> 18:54.800
Where is it?

18:54.884 --> 18:55.884
That way!

18:59.388 --> 19:01.556
Here is the ransom for your father.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.308
Are you sure you can afford it?

19:03.392 --> 19:05.310
I make as much as Malcolm in the Middle.

19:05.394 --> 19:08.730
And because I have no parents,
my earnings remain unstolen.

19:11.776 --> 19:13.443
We're supposed to bring the ransom money

19:13.528 --> 19:15.111
to the top of Sugar Loaf Mountain.

19:15.196 --> 19:17.322
The tension is killing me!

19:17.406 --> 19:18.657
How about this?

19:19.909 --> 19:23.662
That's not tense enough. It's
making light of the situation.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.707
Yup, that's it. Just
right. That's the one.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.417
Look, there's Dad!

19:30.086 --> 19:34.339
Listen, I made a little scrapbook
to remember the kidnapping.

19:34.423 --> 19:37.592
I'm still working on
it. But as you can see...

19:38.094 --> 19:41.263
Look. This is that cigarette
butt you burned me with.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.098
You slept like a baby that night.

19:45.977 --> 19:47.102
I remember that, yeah.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.649
Homer, why are you laughing?

19:52.733 --> 19:54.693
He has the Stockholm syndrome.

19:54.777 --> 19:57.863
He has come to identify
with his captors.

19:57.947 --> 20:00.073
They let me stay up all night!

20:00.199 --> 20:02.325
Well, you won't be doing that at home.

20:02.410 --> 20:05.287
Now, hand over the money
and you get your Homer back.

20:11.502 --> 20:13.962
Look at all that pink and purple.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.797
Our money sure is gay.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.090
You are free to go.

20:17.174 --> 20:18.216
Woo-hoo!

20:20.177 --> 20:22.012
Piece of cake!

20:25.725 --> 20:29.060
We should make these
transfers in a safer place.

20:29.145 --> 20:32.814
It was Homer's idea.
You say no to that face.

20:48.164 --> 20:49.748
Homie, are you okay?

20:49.832 --> 20:52.083
Yes, honey. I'm better than okay.

20:52.168 --> 20:55.587
Because I've learned that
no matter how bad I screw up,

20:55.671 --> 20:57.756
you'll always bail me out.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.049
Aw...

21:03.804 --> 21:05.305
Mom? Dad?

21:05.681 --> 21:07.223
We better do something about this.

21:07.308 --> 21:10.018
Don't be sad. It's Carnival!

21:14.482 --> 21:15.607
Whoopee!
