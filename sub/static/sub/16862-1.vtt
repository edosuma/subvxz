Janet's pregnant.

00:26.170 --> 00:28.330
Wasn't planned,you know?

Just happened.

01:31.270 --> 01:33.840
You think that I wanted that?

01:33.840 --> 01:37.030
Is that what you think,you son of a bitch?

01:37.340 --> 01:38.840
Shit!

Tommy! Tommy! Wake up.

01:42.190 --> 01:43.820
Please,tommy,wake up.

01:54.790 --> 01:56.380
I remember driving there.

01:56.400 --> 01:57.620
Um...

01:59.450 --> 02:02.850
she looked...great.

02:04.330 --> 02:08.900
She was,uh,wearing this dress.

02:09.460 --> 02:10.990
She got all dressed up for dinner.

02:11.009 --> 02:18.220
Um,plus the--the light,you know,from sunset.

02:18.960 --> 02:22.430
And,u and,uh...

02:22.440 --> 02:24.720
so we started to talk.

02:24.770 --> 02:27.720
Blah blah this,blah blah that.

02:27.740 --> 02:30.900
Next thing you know,she's,uh,she's pissed at me.

02:30.920 --> 02:36.020
Um,I should mention here,um...

02:40.580 --> 02:42.350
I've,uh...

02:43.600 --> 02:44.820
I have a drinking problem,

02:44.840 --> 02:49.000
and,um,sometimes it's happened before with her.

02:49.060 --> 02:50.030
I,uh...

02:50.670 --> 02:53.340
I've had blackouts and she's had to...

02:54.090 --> 02:59.300
piece the night back together for me.

02:59.370 --> 03:06.790
So,that particular night I was drinking seltzer
and she was drinking white wine,

03:06.830 --> 03:12.570
and after the conversation went south,

03:12.600 --> 03:24.030
she said she wanted to go inside
and watch this television show about weasels--meerkats.

03:24.060 --> 03:26.950
Meerkat manor.

03:27.670 --> 03:31.840
So we went inside and next thing you know,

03:31.890 --> 03:38.880
we're watching this show and the narrator is--
he gives the meerkats' names.

03:38.900 --> 03:46.160
So there's this meerkat named shakespeare
and he gets bit by a scorpion,

03:46.190 --> 03:51.160
and there's some question about whether
or not he's going to make it back to the home...

03:51.180 --> 03:57.900
base,you know,the place wher
where the rest of the meerkat tribe is and they¡ª

03:57.920 --> 03:59.820
I was really worried about the guy-- shakespeare.

03:59.840 --> 04:04.080
He's--he was looking--he was looking pretty bad.

04:04.110 --> 04:05.300
And,uh...

04:08.880 --> 04:12.820
next thing I know,I'm laying in the sand and--and,uh...

04:12.860 --> 04:16.459
I can hear people screaming and...and...

04:16.480 --> 04:18.640
This doesn't add up,mr. Gavin.

04:19.050 --> 04:21.040
- I'm sorry?
- Your story.

04:21.070 --> 04:25.050
According to the facts we have in front of us,
there were signs of an accelerant.

04:25.080 --> 04:27.280
I don't know anything about...an accelerant.

04:27.310 --> 04:29.720
You co-signed a fire insurance policy on the house

04:29.750 --> 04:33.770
and a life insurance policy on mrs. Keefe
2 weeks before the fire.

04:34.670 --> 04:35.640
No,I didn'T.

04:35.680 --> 04:37.230
Mr. Gavin,please.

04:37.250 --> 04:39.260
I'm telling you,I think I would remember--

04:39.290 --> 04:40.500
You don't remember starting the fire.

04:40.520 --> 04:42.750
How the hell can we expect you
to remember signing the goddamn policies?

04:42.770 --> 04:44.550
I didn't start the fire,ok?

04:44.560 --> 04:45.530
Listen to me.

04:45.560 --> 04:49.230
We know. You're a dru a very convenient drinking problem.

04:49.260 --> 04:50.180
It's a disease,ok?

04:50.200 --> 04:52.210
So is cancer.
Do you want to blame cancer blame cancer for the fire?

04:52.230 --> 04:53.500
Tell the truth,mr. Gavin.

04:53.530 --> 04:54.880
- I'm telling the truth.
- No,you're not.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.940
- Yes,I am. I am telling--
- No,you're not.

04:56.960 --> 04:59.200
I'm telling the truth,ok?

04:59.240 --> 05:00.870
We were inside.

05:00.910 --> 05:02.290
I was on the couch.

05:02.300 --> 05:03.760
She was in the easy chair.

05:03.790 --> 05:06.050
We were watching the meerkats,ok?

05:15.160 --> 05:16.330
Look at you.

05:16.360 --> 05:18.050
Shh...

05:21.250 --> 05:21.960
You got him?

05:22.000 --> 05:23.170
I got him.

05:23.210 --> 05:24.820
Go back to sleep.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.210
I'm trying to get him to go to sleep.

05:59.240 --> 06:00.690
Do you have any idea what time it is?

06:00.730 --> 06:02.430
- 3:00 A.M.
- It is?

06:02.460 --> 06:04.260
- Jesus christ.
- 3:16,to be exact.

06:04.280 --> 06:08.460
And I told you 12:00,
and I meant midnight,not noontime. What--

06:08.480 --> 06:10.270
We couldn't get out the club 'cause this group of guys,

06:10.270 --> 06:12.450
they were such assholes to tony,ok?

06:12.490 --> 06:13.900
And then there was this group of girls.

06:13.920 --> 06:15.370
Oh,my god,this one chick--

06:15.400 --> 06:17.910
she had this weird tattoo on her arm and,
god,she was such a bitch.

06:17.930 --> 06:19.550
She wanted tony to sign her tit.

06:19.580 --> 06:20.550
Ew!

06:20.600 --> 06:22.930
And anyways,then we stopped for a burger.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.500
Then he had to stop and get gas,so then--

06:24.530 --> 06:26.280
Wait,wait,wait. He's a he?

06:26.310 --> 06:27.080
Who?

06:27.120 --> 06:28.080
Tony.

06:28.110 --> 06:29.150
Yeah,he's my boyfriend.

06:29.180 --> 06:30.780
Whatever happened to wh-- what's her name?

06:30.810 --> 06:31.560

06:32.420 --> 06:33.450
Yeah,whatever.

06:33.470 --> 06:36.210
Dad,that was so 6 months ago,ok?

06:36.240 --> 06:36.990
I'm through with girls.

06:37.020 --> 06:38.340
Girls are crazy.

06:38.370 --> 06:40.220
It was a phase I was going through.

06:40.240 --> 06:43.490
Oh,your grandmother thought that,
you know,me and your...

06:43.520 --> 06:46.310
mom were just a phase,and look at us. Huh?

06:46.340 --> 06:47.040
Not now.

06:47.080 --> 06:48.870
I mean,you know--and let me tell you something.

06:48.910 --> 06:51.610
Girls might be crazy,but girls are crazy all the time.

06:51.640 --> 06:52.390
They're dependable.

06:52.410 --> 06:57.500
Guys are,you know--guys are just--
I mean,what's this guy doing signing--you know...

06:57.520 --> 06:59.570

06:59.590 --> 07:01.490

07:01.740 --> 07:03.440
He's a musician.

07:03.460 --> 07:08.000
Are you--are you-- that you--

07:08.420 --> 07:10.670

07:10.690 --> 07:13.690
wait--what instrument does he play?

07:13.720 --> 07:15.640
He's the lead singer.

07:15.710 --> 07:16.420
He's not a musician,ok?

07:16.430 --> 07:18.980
The 4 guys up on stage with hi are the musicians.

07:19.010 --> 07:20.390
Lead singer...

07:20.430 --> 07:22.130

and sleep with all the chicks.

07:27.750 --> 07:29.500
How old's this guy?

07:29.670 --> 07:30.520
26.

07:30.550 --> 07:34.570
Jesus christ,26-year-old--
do you know how old that is in rock and roll years?

07:34.590 --> 07:35.970
He's like 70,ok?

07:35.990 --> 07:39.280
He's like the clint eastwood of rock and roll.

07:42.140 --> 07:45.550
Is that a hickey on your neck?

07:46.020 --> 07:48.530
Are--are you having...

07:48.590 --> 07:49.730
sex with this guy?

07:49.740 --> 07:52.290
That's none of your business,dad.

07:52.560 --> 07:54.680

Hang on there,missy.

07:56.420 --> 07:57.200
I have to go to the bathroom.

07:57.220 --> 07:58.630
Let me tell you something.

07:58.660 --> 08:00.020
You're not fooling anybody.

08:00.050 --> 08:01.570
Yeah. Yeah,oh,yeah.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.770
I smelled the pot when you walked in,ok?

08:03.810 --> 08:05.350
****Yeah.

08:05.370 --> 08:06.900
And I can smell the sex.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.050
Pot and sex--I can smell them both.

08:09.060 --> 08:10.250
Yeah.

08:10.290 --> 08:11.240
Ok,dad.

08:11.260 --> 08:13.290
Ok. Reality check time,ok?

08:13.330 --> 08:15.170
- Yes,I have sex.
- Shh.

08:15.180 --> 08:15.940
Yeah,you heard me¡ª

08:15.970 --> 08:19.110
I just had sex,with tony,in his car,

08:19.130 --> 08:21.610
right after I smoked a big fat joint.

08:21.610 --> 08:22.990
Very funny.

08:23.020 --> 08:24.470
Ve--what?

08:25.520 --> 08:27.240
Jesus!

08:29.510 --> 08:31.380
Oh,yeah.

08:31.640 --> 08:33.650
The pot made me forget.

08:33.730 --> 08:35.679
I also drink now.

08:35.830 --> 08:40.400
Tonight I had vodka,beer,and peppermint schnapps.

08:41.390 --> 08:43.880
A lot of peppermint schnapps.

08:44.520 --> 08:46.090
Hey! Hey!

08:46.110 --> 08:49.010
I am telling your mother.

08:49.470 --> 08:50.890
Earth to dad.

08:50.930 --> 08:52.730
She already knows.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.580
Yeah,hey,hey.

08:55.620 --> 08:56.480
Get up. Get up.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.970
Not now,tommy. This is a bad idea.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.080
Sex always leads--

09:00.110 --> 09:02.010
No,no,no,no,no. That's not it.

09:02.800 --> 09:05.340
Colleen is smoking pot.

09:05.420 --> 09:06.590
I know.

09:06.620 --> 09:08.350
You know? What do you mean,you know?

09:08.380 --> 09:10.880
Yeah,and it's good pot,too,not the cheap shit we used to get.

09:10.910 --> 09:11.610
Great,great.

09:11.630 --> 09:12.580
That's--that's a great attitude.

09:12.600 --> 09:14.880
You know,I told you years ago,
pot's a gateway drug.

09:14.930 --> 09:17.430
So tonight she comes home,
not only is she high,she's drunk.

09:17.450 --> 09:18.160
- What--
- Drunk,yeah.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.850
Shit-faced. Puked--yeah.

09:19.890 --> 09:20.790
Was she driving?

09:20.820 --> 09:24.260
No,I think her 50-year-old boyfriend
was handling the driving responsibilities.

09:24.280 --> 09:25.750
Uh,he's 26.

09:25.780 --> 09:26.910
And that's good. That's good.

09:26.940 --> 09:27.860
Why is that good?

09:27.900 --> 09:29.150
Because he doesn't drink.

09:29.190 --> 09:32.660
Ok,but I'm pretty sure that she's banging this guy.

09:33.560 --> 09:34.200
Yeah.

09:34.250 --> 09:35.710
I know.

09:35.740 --> 09:37.070
Look,she's on the pill.

09:37.080 --> 09:38.490
You put her on the pill?

09:38.510 --> 09:40.760
Is that--insane.

09:40.780 --> 09:43.990
To--I mean,you got the whole toolbox going.

09:44.020 --> 09:45.520
Booze,penises.

09:45.560 --> 09:50.200
I mean,I can't believe
that I'm finally the moral compass in this family.

09:50.230 --> 09:50.930
Yeah,well.

09:50.950 --> 09:52.530
You're an enabler,that's what you are.

09:52.560 --> 09:54.590
Yeah,yeah.

09:55.450 --> 09:56.690
Shh.

09:56.800 --> 09:59.130
When were you planning on telling me about this?

09:59.140 --> 10:01.700
Well,I was going to drop the sex bomb on you a while ago,

10:01.740 --> 10:05.450
but then this whole platonic living arrangement thing
has been going so well.

10:05.480 --> 10:06.220
Yeah.

10:06.260 --> 10:09.200
You know,and then you always
take the word "sex" as an invitation,

10:09.220 --> 10:11.000
so I didn't want to risk it.

10:11.030 --> 10:14.380
And as for the pot and booze,well,
check her birth certificate.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.470
The last name's gavin.

10:16.490 --> 10:17.690
Good night.

10:18.710 --> 10:20.880
S-so that wasn't an invitation?

10:20.920 --> 10:23.270
Oh,my god,get out of here.

10:23.670 --> 10:24.710
Daddy?

10:26.090 --> 10:28.120
What's a sex bomb?

10:28.250 --> 10:30.660
Oh,honey,that's,um-- tommy?

10:34.450 --> 10:35.690
Are you going to go to jail,dad?

10:35.710 --> 10:37.610
No,who said I'm going to jail?

10:37.610 --> 10:43.050
Well,mom,cousin eddie,father o'brien,

10:43.060 --> 10:45.210
I'm not--never mind father o'brien,ok?

10:45.240 --> 10:46.660
I'm not going to jail.

10:47.360 --> 10:49.520
Smells like christmas out here.

10:49.550 --> 10:51.160
That's not christmas,honey.

10:53.270 --> 10:54.360

Happy holidays.

13:02.870 --> 13:05.180
I reached level 60.

13:05.570 --> 13:07.420
I need to find a new game now.

13:07.460 --> 13:09.350
Yeah,but wait a second. That's not possible,rich.

13:09.370 --> 13:11.510
That's the conquest trethfellon,right?

13:11.530 --> 13:13.230
It's the most intricate,difficult--

13:13.260 --> 13:15.630
I kicked its ass!

13:15.880 --> 13:18.610
It took garrity 8 months to reach level 5.

13:18.650 --> 13:20.340
You just beat the whole game in--

13:20.370 --> 13:24.100
4 hours,9 minutes--nigger!

13:25.260 --> 13:27.880
When are you going to marry my sister?

13:27.930 --> 13:29.050
'Scuse me?

13:29.080 --> 13:30.810
When are you going to marry her?

13:30.860 --> 13:35.240
Uh,we hadn't really-- I mean,you know,
there's been a little conversation,

13:35.270 --> 13:39.200
but nothing,uh--oh,I get it.

13:39.300 --> 13:43.410
You're,uh--you're worried that your sister and I
are going to hook up

13:43.450 --> 13:46.790
and that you'll get left behind or sent off on your own.

13:46.810 --> 13:47.560
Is that it,rich?

13:47.590 --> 13:48.850
Nigger!

13:49.420 --> 13:51.750
No,asshole.

13:52.430 --> 13:57.120
I want her married so I can get on with my life.

13:57.130 --> 13:58.070
Yeah,what life?

13:58.090 --> 14:00.600
My life!

14:01.200 --> 14:02.550
Ok,franco?

14:02.560 --> 14:03.440
Ok.

14:03.460 --> 14:05.660
But I mean,you know,come on,let's be real.

14:05.680 --> 14:07.060
You take classes at the center,

14:07.090 --> 14:09.540
you bag groceries at the food emporium
like 3 days a week,

14:09.560 --> 14:13.150
and you sit around this apartment
beating video games in record time.

14:13.180 --> 14:13.840
I mean,other than that--

14:13.860 --> 14:16.800
I want to get laid,franco.

14:17.570 --> 14:22.360
How am I supposed to do
that with my sister hanging around?

14:22.860 --> 14:25.990
I'm horny.

14:26.120 --> 14:27.900
Nigger!

14:28.480 --> 14:33.170
You do realize in order to get laid you
got to have a girl,right?

14:33.270 --> 14:34.600
I got a girl.

14:34.630 --> 14:35.890
Really?

14:35.920 --> 14:38.210
I'm going to smack your face.

14:38.230 --> 14:38.930
What?

14:38.960 --> 14:41.480
I got a girl.

14:42.180 --> 14:44.730
Her name is barbara.

14:45.040 --> 14:47.400
I met her at the center.

14:47.490 --> 14:51.760
What,does she work there or is she one of the,
uh,you know,your--your people--

14:51.790 --> 14:52.740
Retards.

14:52.790 --> 14:53.860
Yeah.

14:53.890 --> 14:56.490
She has down syndrome.

14:57.010 --> 14:59.700
She's partially deaf.

15:00.460 --> 15:03.050
She's in a wheelchair.

15:03.650 --> 15:05.930
But she's got the sweetest ass.

15:05.970 --> 15:08.460
Yeah,but if she's in a wheelchair,how can you see it?

15:08.990 --> 15:11.200
They stand her up sometimes.

15:11.250 --> 15:12.470
Uh-huh.

15:12.510 --> 15:17.030
Um,listen,natalie and I,we got no plans
as far as marriage is concerned right now.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.430
Ok,as soon as that changes,rich,I'll let you know.

15:19.470 --> 15:21.800
Make it fast.

15:21.980 --> 15:23.890
I'm dying here.

15:24.960 --> 15:25.740
Yeah?

15:25.770 --> 15:27.190
It's dr. Brown.

15:27.210 --> 15:27.720
I'm sorry--who?

15:27.760 --> 15:29.340
Dr. Brown.

15:29.380 --> 15:30.290
Jeff,is that you?

15:30.310 --> 15:32.670
Jesus christ,eddie,you trying to get me shit-canned?

15:32.690 --> 15:34.470
Sorry,sorry,sorry. I forgot.

15:34.500 --> 15:35.940
I got the test results.

15:35.970 --> 15:36.670
And?

15:36.710 --> 15:37.750
Dead on.

15:37.780 --> 15:39.420
Oh,shit.

15:39.460 --> 15:40.550
Are you sure?

15:40.590 --> 15:41.530
Yep.

15:41.570 --> 15:43.120
All even.

15:48.090 --> 15:49.680
This is wrong.

15:49.790 --> 15:51.210
I think that's enough. Ok.

15:51.240 --> 15:52.630
Oh,yeah,that's rough.

15:52.760 --> 15:53.850
Oh,god.

15:54.640 --> 15:55.990
Oh,god.

15:56.050 --> 15:57.170
Oh,god!

15:57.190 --> 15:59.260
Oh,yeah,that's it,that's it,that's it.

15:59.280 --> 16:00.440
Just keep on saying that, 'cause if we get caught

16:00.470 --> 16:02.310
I can always say that there was prayer involved.

16:02.340 --> 16:03.780
Yeah. Oh,yeah.

16:03.810 --> 16:05.690
No,I can't,I can'T.

16:05.720 --> 16:06.530
I can'T.

16:06.560 --> 16:07.500
Theresa,I can't do this.

16:07.530 --> 16:08.510
- I'm sorry.
- What?

16:08.530 --> 16:09.530
Just stop it,ok?

16:09.560 --> 16:11.450
I was raised a catholic,for god sakes.

16:11.490 --> 16:13.200
So I was a nun.

16:14.570 --> 16:15.670
Oh,god.

16:18.630 --> 16:19.570
Shit!

16:19.600 --> 16:20.820
Ow!

16:25.110 --> 16:27.870
Uh,hi. Um,sorry.

16:27.970 --> 16:29.400
Just,um...

16:30.000 --> 16:33.060
making sure the organ was ok.

16:34.470 --> 16:36.580
It's,uh,it's fine.

16:37.780 --> 16:39.620
Bless you all.

16:45.560 --> 16:46.950
Hey,hi,maggie.

16:46.980 --> 16:48.160
Are you going somewhere?

16:48.180 --> 16:51.350
I just--I was--
I was going to take a walk down to the you know?

16:51.380 --> 16:53.800
Maybe get a--a muffin.

16:53.960 --> 16:55.040
Muffin face.

16:56.510 --> 16:59.090
Is that--is that the big box of porn?

16:59.110 --> 17:00.890
Uh...oh,this box?

17:00.900 --> 17:05.250
Yeah,this--this--
this might have some porn in it,yeah. Yeah.

17:07.119 --> 17:08.839
You're throwing away the porn?

17:08.880 --> 17:10.700
Ok,look,maggie,a lot of wives,

17:10.730 --> 17:13.030
they would thrilled
if their husbands were throwing away the porn.

17:13.060 --> 17:16.359
They would see it as a--as a mature and committed act,

17:16.380 --> 17:19.260
and--and I think you should see this as a real positive thing.

17:19.280 --> 17:21.710
You know,that's all fine and good,sean.

17:21.990 --> 17:23.359
Only it's my porn.

17:23.390 --> 17:25.890
Ok,well,you don't need it anymore,right?

17:25.920 --> 17:26.790
'Cause you got me.

17:26.810 --> 17:28.339
Ha ha ha--put the box down.

17:28.369 --> 17:30.430
Come on,maggie,
I just want to be married for 2 seconds without the--

17:30.450 --> 17:31.580
No,now!

17:33.420 --> 17:34.820
- You see this box?
- Yeah.

17:34.860 --> 17:36.520
This box is your friend.

17:36.540 --> 17:38.640
It might even be your best friend.

17:38.650 --> 17:41.980
Because it's the only thing breathing any life
into our relationship at this point.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.310
Maggie,we've been married 9 months.

17:43.330 --> 17:45.880
Wh-what are you talking about,
breathing life into the relationship?

17:45.910 --> 17:47.340
Everyone needs breath.

17:47.360 --> 17:48.990
Everyone needs a spark,sean!

17:49.020 --> 17:54.840
Ok,and the spark is by watching some chick get double-teamed
by guys with cocks the size of telephone poles?

17:54.870 --> 17:56.600
See,now you understand

17:56.630 --> 17:58.420
No,I don't! I don't understand,maggie.

17:58.440 --> 18:01.730
I don't think you understand,either,
that I might have a problem with this.

18:01.740 --> 18:06.480
That this might make me feel,you know--inferior.

18:06.500 --> 18:09.110
- Oh,but sean,you have nothing to feel inferior about.
- Really?

18:09.120 --> 18:11.720
Well,except for the fact that your cock isn't
as big as a tele a telephone pole, but that's--

18:11.740 --> 18:12.790
That's--ok,I'm going to work.

18:12.810 --> 18:14.710
You know what? Enjoy your porn.

18:14.830 --> 18:16.050
Sean!

18:16.080 --> 18:18.510
You don't want your cock to be that big.

18:18.530 --> 18:19.620
Your life would be terrible.

18:19.640 --> 18:22.050
You would not be able to buy pants.

18:29.930 --> 18:30.640
Yeah?

18:30.670 --> 18:32.460
How's my favorite health nut doing?

18:32.500 --> 18:33.900
Hey,lost 5 more pounds.

18:33.940 --> 18:36.410
Wow! What's that,30 total?

18:36.420 --> 18:37.400
35.

18:37.430 --> 18:41.460
I go in for my stress test in a couple of days
and back to full duty.

18:41.480 --> 18:43.140
That's great,pop.

18:43.150 --> 18:45.400
Hey,uh,how you doing,kid?

18:45.410 --> 18:46.720
I'm engaged.

18:47.850 --> 18:50.070
What? You're kidding.

18:50.090 --> 18:50.990
Nope.

18:51.010 --> 18:52.600
Who's the lucky girl?

18:52.650 --> 18:53.860
Steven.

18:53.890 --> 18:55.420
My boyfriend.

18:55.440 --> 18:56.650
You actually thought it was a woman?

18:56.670 --> 18:58.300
No,no,no,no,no.

18:58.330 --> 19:01.110
I mean,that's--that's--that's really great.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.730
Great.

19:02.750 --> 19:03.640
Is it legal?

19:03.660 --> 19:05.190
In massachusetts,yeah.

19:05.220 --> 19:08.010
But,listen,it's not like a regular wedding service.

19:08.030 --> 19:09.570
It's a commitment ceremony.

19:09.590 --> 19:12.880
We exchange vows in front of friends and family,

19:12.900 --> 19:15.580
and I--I'd like you to...

19:15.970 --> 19:18.090
sort of be my best man.

19:18.250 --> 19:20.200
Make a little speech.

19:21.610 --> 19:22.960
Dad,you there?

19:23.010 --> 19:25.190
Yeah,uh,pete,sure I will.

19:25.210 --> 19:27.530
I,uh. I,uh...

19:27.560 --> 19:30.160
there's nothing that would make me happier
than to do that for you.

19:30.190 --> 19:31.420
Bullshit.

19:31.440 --> 19:33.940
You got me there,but,uh...

19:34.220 --> 19:37.220
I'll be there,and I'll be there with bells on.

19:37.240 --> 19:38.080
That's great.

19:38.130 --> 19:39.230
Thanks,dad.

19:39.250 --> 19:43.510
Yeah,sur to kiss the bride,do I?

19:43.530 --> 19:44.840
Not on my lips.

19:45.910 --> 19:47.010
Gotcha!

19:47.040 --> 19:48.800
I'll talk to you later,pop.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.580
- Is that oprah?
- No.

19:55.600 --> 20:00.960
Yeah,you,uh--
well,I was trying to get sportscenter,b everywhere.

20:00.970 --> 20:02.170
This is crazy.

20:02.190 --> 20:04.280
It still smells like puke in here.

20:04.310 --> 20:06.690
Well,I--I used the glade.

20:06.700 --> 20:09.090
Well,did you use the suddenly spring
or the delicate petals?

20:09.120 --> 20:11.160
I--I--honey,we got bigger problems than the puke,ok?

20:11.180 --> 20:16.450
Colleen--sex with the boyfriend
in front of the house last night,in the car.

20:16.460 --> 20:17.420
How about that?

20:17.420 --> 20:18.890
Neighbors could've seen it,you know?

20:18.920 --> 20:20.390
- What?
- So did we.

20:21.380 --> 20:22.070
Honey,she's a kid.

20:22.100 --> 20:24.410
She just turned 18.

20:24.420 --> 20:25.390
I mean it's,you know--

20:25.410 --> 20:27.460
You got me pregnant when I was 17.

20:27.490 --> 20:31.390
- Ok,that was--
- In your truck,while we were drinking,and on quaaludes.

20:31.400 --> 20:32.990
It was the seventies,ok?

20:33.020 --> 20:35.760
Freddy fender,pet rocks.

20:35.810 --> 20:37.380
What did the super say?

20:37.410 --> 20:39.520
He's working on it. He's,uh...

20:40.160 --> 20:41.980
All right,you ready?

20:43.610 --> 20:45.490

20:47.350 --> 20:48.680
Ready?

20:48.710 --> 20:50.410
Ready ready.

20:55.820 --> 20:57.440
- Wow.
- Shh,shh,shh.

20:57.470 --> 21:00.420
- Nice.
- Shh,shh,shh...

21:01.850 --> 21:03.880
oh...Tom Tommy,you jinxed it.

21:03.920 --> 21:04.720
I didn't jinx it.

21:04.760 --> 21:08.000
He just-- he had--he drank his bottle too fast.

21:09.270 --> 21:10.540
rub his back a little bit.

21:10.570 --> 21:12.040
Oh,tommy,I know how to take care of kids.

21:12.080 --> 21:14.020
- I'm not telling you--
- I had 3 kids,you know?

21:14.040 --> 21:14.850
- I know.
- I breastfed.

21:14.890 --> 21:16.310
I bathed them,I diapered them.

21:16.360 --> 21:17.940
- I was just--
- This baby hates me.

21:17.960 --> 21:18.910
He doesn't hate you.

21:18.930 --> 21:20.360
He needs to have his back rubbed,ok?

21:20.390 --> 21:22.070
Just take him.

21:22.090 --> 21:22.970
I just gave him to you.

21:22.990 --> 21:24.180
Honey,give him a couple more seconds.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.670
Take him.

21:32.210 --> 21:33.360
Tommy...

21:36.980 --> 21:41.470
Look,don'T...dwell on it,ok?

21:41.500 --> 21:44.350
It's just--you know.

21:44.360 --> 21:45.930
This baby hates me.

21:45.950 --> 21:48.060
He--honey,he's a baby.

21:48.090 --> 21:50.520
He doesn't even know what hate is.

21:50.560 --> 21:51.270
He's a gavin.

21:51.290 --> 21:53.290
He was born to hate.

21:53.310 --> 21:55.030
You know,come to think of it,I think he's all gavin.

21:55.060 --> 21:56.220
Half johnny,half you.

21:56.240 --> 21:57.790
Ok,you know what?

21:57.850 --> 22:01.120
This--if he was half johnny,
he'd--he'd hate me,and he doesn'T.

22:01.140 --> 22:02.750
He loves me--look.

22:05.030 --> 22:08.250
Well,he still kind of looks like me,right?

22:08.400 --> 22:11.800
I mean,he's got the blond peach fuzz coming in.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.220
Yeah,but that doesn't mean anything.

22:13.260 --> 22:17.290
In a couple of months,
he could end up with a full head of jet black hair.

22:18.140 --> 22:19.410
I got to go.

22:19.500 --> 22:20.810
No,tommy,tommy,please don't go.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.180
Honey,I got to go to work,ok?

22:23.220 --> 22:26.160
Well,then we got to hire some help,
because I am losing my mind here.

22:26.180 --> 22:28.720
We went over this a million times,ok?

22:28.770 --> 22:32.010
I--you know,
I can't work any extra jobs right now because of the kids,

22:32.040 --> 22:32.900
so we don't have money to--

22:32.920 --> 22:35.240
No,I'm going to get a job.

22:35.270 --> 22:39.150
- Did you just say that you're going to--
- Yeah. I'll get a job.

22:39.170 --> 22:41.470
I have friends who can sit for me.

22:41.530 --> 22:43.660
What are you going to--what are you going to do?

22:43.690 --> 22:44.820
Real estate.

22:44.880 --> 22:47.770
- Well--  Like they--like you--
- I'm good in sales.

22:47.790 --> 22:49.580
You--what? You're good at--

22:49.600 --> 22:53.560
Ok,tommy,what if you end up in jail
and the F.D.N.Y. Cancels your pension?

22:53.580 --> 22:54.900
I'm not going to jail,ok?

22:54.920 --> 22:56.400
Tell you what,while you're out selling property,

22:56.420 --> 23:00.650
take little no-name with you and maybe
he can sell some little tiny little properties¡ª

23:07.500 --> 23:08.600
Thank you,dr. Laura.

23:08.700 --> 23:13.400
I wonder if it's unhealthy to maintain
a relationship with someone who's dead?

23:13.800 --> 23:15.300
Well, it's kind of one-sided.

23:15.400 --> 23:17.800
- Yeah, but it's--
- It's one-sided and--

23:17.900 --> 23:20.600
- well, you can't call it a relationship.
- Why not?

23:22.500 --> 23:23.600
I can't--

23:25.800 --> 23:26.900
Yeah?

23:28.400 --> 23:29.600
Hey.

23:30.100 --> 23:32.900
Hey,was that--was that dr. Laura?

23:33.100 --> 23:37.000
Yeah, my radio froze.
Dumb car, heater's not working.

23:37.400 --> 23:39.000
What's going on?
What's going on with teddy?

23:39.600 --> 23:42.300
Uh, giving the case to the jury within the week.
Looks good for him.

23:42.800 --> 23:44.600
For you? Not so much.

23:45.300 --> 23:47.800
Hey, tom, I heard from my guy
inside the insurance company...

23:47.900 --> 23:51.300
- Yeah, and?
- It's definitely your signature on both policies.

23:51.600 --> 23:55.000
- Life and fire.
- Ok, I never signed anything.

23:55.300 --> 23:57.700
- Yeah, well, someone did.
- Well, it wasn't me.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.300
Jesus christ,tom,you have got to
pull your act together,you know?

24:00.800 --> 24:02.800
Every time you go in there,
you give them a different story,

24:02.900 --> 24:06.600
which at this point is making
things look very,very suspicious.

24:06.800 --> 24:10.100
Well, I--I can't remember everything,eddie.
All right?

24:10.200 --> 24:12.700
Yeah,well,
being a drunken fool is just not going to fly.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.100
- You know?Tom,make something up.
- So you want me to lie?

24:16.400 --> 24:18.500
Yes, through your goddamn teeth,I want you to lie.

24:18.600 --> 24:22.300
- Well--I can't do that.
- You--you--

24:26.000 --> 24:27.400
What's so funny?

24:28.200 --> 24:29.300
You can't lie?

24:29.400 --> 24:33.300
L-look,I can lie to,you know,
my wife,my kids,the guys at work,you know?

24:33.400 --> 24:36.000
The guys at headquarters--cops.
Yeah,I can do that kind of lying.

24:36.100 --> 24:38.900
That's like aaa ball,you know what I mean?
But these--these are lawyers.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.400
This is,you know--this is
major league pitching here.

24:41.500 --> 24:43.800
These guys,
you know--I'm good,but I'm not that good.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.300
Listen to me.

24:45.400 --> 24:49.000
We have got one more shot at this,
tom,day after tomorrow.All right?

24:49.100 --> 24:53.300
Now you come up with a story that
makes plausible sense, practical sense.

24:54.400 --> 24:58.100
Oh,and wear a dress shirt,
for christ sakes,with a jacket.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.100
Asshole.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.500
...Difficult one to explain.Her dad was married--

25:11.300 --> 25:13.100
Jesus...

25:31.300 --> 25:32.500
- hey.
- Hey.

25:32.600 --> 25:34.200
Hey.What's going on?

25:34.300 --> 25:37.800
Freezing our balls off.The heat's out.
Thank god for propane,you know?

25:42.800 --> 25:46.300
Uh,fredo,
you mentioned just a second ago,uh,propane.

25:46.400 --> 25:50.300
Interesting fun fact--did you know
that propane is both a liquid and a gas?

25:50.500 --> 25:54.300
At atmospheric pressure and
temperatures above -44 fahrenheit,

25:54.400 --> 25:58.400
it's a non-toxic,odorless,colorless gas,
and like natural gas,

25:58.500 --> 26:03.200
it has an identifying odor added to it
so it can be detected readily.

26:05.500 --> 26:06.700
Yeah, you--

26:10.000 --> 26:12.800
You know,I still don't know
what you guys like to talk about.

26:13.200 --> 26:15.800
Pussy.That's always a good choice.

26:22.200 --> 26:24.200
Hey,this just in,chief.The power's out.

26:24.300 --> 26:25.600
Ah, jeez, when it rains,it pours.

26:25.700 --> 26:26.900
We're on *****

26:27.000 --> 26:29.900
so if you want to read or you want to take a shit
or you want to do both at the same time,

26:30.000 --> 26:33.300
you better take one of these.
Jesus,tommy,you look like shit.

26:33.400 --> 26:35.700
I was up and down with the
baby most of the night,ok,so--

26:35.800 --> 26:38.900
- Oh,you know,you just missed your girlfriend--
- Not my girlfriend,ok?

26:39.000 --> 26:42.400
Second of all--barely a firefighter,ok?
Volley.Goddamn volley.

26:42.500 --> 26:45.600
Yeah,volley or no volley,
she pulled your ass out of a fire,bro.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.100
That alone, you owe her dinner,right?

26:47.600 --> 26:49.400
Ok, I'm going to take her to dinner,ok?

26:49.600 --> 26:51.200
- What's the big thing?I mean--
- There's no big thing.

26:51.300 --> 26:54.500
She lifted you up off a hot melting floor,
she slung you over her shoulder,

26:54.600 --> 26:56.300
- she carried you outside--
- allegedly.

26:56.400 --> 26:57.700
Like you yourself have done a million times.

26:57.800 --> 27:00.800
Yeah,not to mention she probably slipped you a little
tongue when she was giving you mouth-to-mouth.Right?

27:00.900 --> 27:02.500
Just like you yourself have
done at least,you know--

27:02.600 --> 27:04.800
Once.Ok?Did it once.Twice.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.400
- 2 times,that was it.
- Hey,you know what?This is really weird about this.

27:07.500 --> 27:10.400
Like the whole chick-saving-you thing,
it's like a role reversal thing,you know?

27:10.500 --> 27:12.600
It's like lois lane saving superman.

27:12.700 --> 27:15.200
My hoops are here.Guys,help my cousin unload this.
Will you get mikey,please?

27:15.300 --> 27:18.300
- What? What? What hoops?
- Oh, basketball hoops.

27:18.500 --> 27:22.200
Yeah,I got 2 brand-new backboards,N.B.A. Style.

27:22.400 --> 27:25.700
I got floor paint,
I got a brand-new box of balls,the whole 9 yards.

27:25.800 --> 27:28.600
- For what?
- For the b-ball court we're putting in the basement.

27:28.800 --> 27:30.200
- Hey!B-ball--
- what?

27:30.300 --> 27:31.700
Vito, how's it going?

27:31.800 --> 27:33.900
3 hours on the goddamn B.Q.E. With ****

27:34.000 --> 27:35.500
And cold goddamn coffee,that's how it's going.

27:35.600 --> 27:37.500
Ok,I thought we were putting a street
hockey court in--in the basement.

27:37.600 --> 27:39.900
- Nope.Nixed--new york nixed.
- Since when?

27:40.000 --> 27:41.800
Uh,since last night.
Listen,I got a couple guys helping.

27:41.900 --> 27:43.200
We're going to help you unload all this crap, ok?

27:43.300 --> 27:44.700
What do you mean, since last night? I don't--

27:44.800 --> 27:46.500
We--we took a vote, ok?By email.

27:46.600 --> 27:49.000
You can't--I don't do email.
You can't take a vote by email.

27:49.200 --> 27:50.600
What smells like puke?

27:50.800 --> 27:52.900
You're a regular riot.
Can I talk to you over here?

27:53.000 --> 27:54.900
- Funny guy, my cousin.
- Yeah,he's very funny.

27:55.200 --> 27:57.100
So you guys took a vote and I'm not included?
What's that about?

27:57.200 --> 28:00.900
Look, we--the crew decided that
matters concerning the future of this house

28:01.000 --> 28:03.900
should be voted on by guys
who are actually going to be here in the future.

28:04.200 --> 28:05.600
- Ok, what? Huh?
- Yeah,well,you know,

28:05.700 --> 28:07.500
the word on the street is you're going to jail.

28:07.600 --> 28:09.400
Ok,I don't know what street that is,
but that's the wrong street,

28:09.600 --> 28:10.900
- 'cause I'm not going to jail.
- I'm just saying--

28:11.000 --> 28:12.400
- Well,that's now what I hear.
- Jesus.

28:12.500 --> 28:13.500
I got a friend down at H.Q.

28:13.600 --> 28:15.600
He says they're this close to getting rid of you.

28:15.700 --> 28:17.700
- Wh-what's your friend's name?
- Kenny o'connell.

28:17.800 --> 28:19.600
- Maybe he could help me out.
- Nah, hates your guts.

28:19.700 --> 28:22.500
- Why?
- Well,he says at some christmas party a couple of years ago,

28:22.600 --> 28:25.000
- he was passed out--
- Shaved his eyebrows,yeah,yeah,yeah.

28:25.200 --> 28:27.100
- That kenny o'connell,ok.Well--
- They never grew back.

28:27.200 --> 28:28.300
- Really?
- Yeah.

28:28.500 --> 28:31.000
- That's a shame.
- Yeah.Well,you know,I can give him a call.

28:31.400 --> 28:36.100
It's better than seeing him in person.
It's just...all forehead.

28:38.700 --> 28:40.100
- Hey--
- Stay away from my balls.

28:40.200 --> 28:42.800
Did we or did we not have the
worst firehouse basketball team

28:42.900 --> 28:45.100
in the history of firehouse basket
basketball before 9/11,am I not wrong?

28:45.200 --> 28:47.000
Yes--no, no, you're right.It's true,

28:47.100 --> 28:49.500
but that was back when all we
had to offer was franco and nels

28:49.600 --> 28:51.800
and those 8 spastic giants from the engine,ok?

28:51.900 --> 28:54.200
- Yeah.What do you have to offer--
- Listen, my spies are telling me

28:54.500 --> 28:57.100
that coming through the probie
class right now is a black kid,

28:57.200 --> 28:59.200
afro-american,as kramer might say,

28:59.300 --> 29:03.200
who is so goddamn good as an outside shooter,
people are calling him the next jackie ryan.

29:03.300 --> 29:05.800
- Jackie ryan--the jackie ryan?
- Yes, the jackie ryan.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
And I'm making a play to get
him assigned to this house,

29:08.100 --> 29:13.200
and if that happens,ok,you will notice a widening
suspicious stain on the front of my person.

29:13.300 --> 29:14.800
Do not be alarmed.

29:14.900 --> 29:17.900
Just know that I'm very happy
and go about your business.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.700
Uh,mikey's laying down in the bunkroom.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.300
- So wake him up.
- Yeah, I tried.

29:21.400 --> 29:23.400
- And?
- I mean,I think he's--

29:23.500 --> 29:24.900
I think he's dead.

29:25.500 --> 29:27.400
Look at him.He looks so peaceful.

29:27.600 --> 29:28.800
That's because he's an idiot.

29:28.900 --> 29:32.500
It's his look.In a fire,after a fire,
on his way home from a fire,awake,asleep,

29:32.600 --> 29:34.500
it's always the same look.You check his pulse?

29:34.600 --> 29:36.600
- I didn't--should I?
- No, see--that's your look.

29:36.700 --> 29:38.700
- He's peaceful,you're befuddled.
- Get out of the way.

29:38.800 --> 29:40.300
- Uh, excuse me? Befuddled?
- Confused.

29:40.400 --> 29:42.700
You know, I'm really pissed
off about this basketball thing.

29:42.800 --> 29:44.300
Excuse me,I know what befuddled means,thanks.

29:44.400 --> 29:46.600
Yeah, it's because tommy just told
you it means "confused,"asshole.

29:46.700 --> 29:49.300
No, it's not. I know because I just know,
all right, jerk?

29:49.500 --> 29:51.000
Yeah, yeah, he's alive.Hey, mikey.

29:51.100 --> 29:52.900
- Hey, hey!
- Mike, wake up, buddy. You allright?

29:53.000 --> 29:54.200
Oh, thank god.Hey.

29:54.300 --> 29:57.600
Oh, hey, guys. Wow. How long was I out for?

29:57.700 --> 29:59.000
How the hell do we know?
What time did you get here?

29:59.100 --> 30:02.300
- I don't know. I had a colon-scopy this morning--
- Colonoscopy.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.000
Oh, and they give you drugs and stuff.

30:04.100 --> 30:07.400
Yeah, I guess shoving a 5-foot long camera up
your ass falls into the "and stuff" category.

30:07.500 --> 30:11.100
Well, my mom's been sick lately and there's
a history of colon cancer in my family,

30:11.200 --> 30:14.900
so I thought I'd play it safe
and check out the situation and stuff.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.700
Yeah,you know,you say "and stuff" one more time,
I'm going to shove my flashlight up your ass.

30:17.800 --> 30:18.900
Yeah, that'd be the second time today.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.900
Hey, did you vote "ye this basketball court thing?

30:21.000 --> 30:22.800
- You looked stressed out,tommy.
- Yeah, a little stressed out.

30:22.900 --> 30:26.000
The basketball thing,
haven't had sex or a smoke in 9 months,

30:26.100 --> 30:28.000
and I just found out everybody I know
pretty much thinks I'm going to jail,

30:28.100 --> 30:31.200
so, you know, yeah--stressed? Yeah, little bit.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
- Well, hey, look at the bright side.
- Which is what?

30:34.100 --> 30:36.400
When you're in jail,there's probably
going to be a lot of black guys,

30:36.500 --> 30:37.800
and they're probably going to play a lot of hoops.

30:37.900 --> 30:39.100
- So?
- So when you get out,

30:39.500 --> 30:41.400
you'll be a lot better.Or good, at least.

30:41.500 --> 30:43.000
- See, that's his look.
- What is it, angry?

30:43.100 --> 30:45.200
- Murderous.
- You're not getting that basketball court.

30:45.300 --> 30:46.800
Yeah, what're you going to do, shiv me?

30:51.700 --> 30:54.400
- So are you a, uh--you're a cat lover?
- I am, yeah.

30:54.500 --> 30:56.500
- You have cats at home?
- I do. I have 4.

30:56.600 --> 31:00.400
Oh, great, we--we have a bunch of cats
trapped on the second or third floor.

31:00.500 --> 31:02.200
Yeah, I heard them meowing and I went up there,

31:02.300 --> 31:05.800
but they're trapped up under this
loft and they won't come down.

31:06.000 --> 31:10.700
- Poor things, they got to be frozen solid.
- Yeah, well, cat-sicles.My favorite treat.

31:10.800 --> 31:14.200
All right,lads. Let's leave
the tanks and bring the catnip.

31:14.600 --> 31:16.400
- Garrity, g-give him a hand.
- Yeah.

31:17.600 --> 31:20.900
- Was it wrong that I called?
- Uh, no, no. Trapped cats.

31:21.100 --> 31:25.200
You know, one man's blessing
is another man's 911 call.

31:28.300 --> 31:29.800
Goddamn cats.

31:30.100 --> 31:33.600
How come it's never anything worthwhile
trapped inside a building,like gold ingots.

31:33.700 --> 31:35.300
Musket and ingots within 5 minutes.

31:35.400 --> 31:38.100
Sounds like someone's been playing
scrabble with rain man again.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.500
He had a lot of ts.

31:40.100 --> 31:41.800
- You're voting for that hockey rink.
- What are you talking about?

31:41.900 --> 31:45.100
You're voting for that hockey rink,
or I'm buying maggie more porn,yeah.

31:45.200 --> 31:47.000
- How did you know about that?
- Big black cocks,oh,yeah.

31:47.100 --> 31:49.700
I know about it--her favorite genre.
Yeah,you're voting for that rink.

31:49.800 --> 31:52.900
Now, you see, this is a wonderful apartment
if you were a young couple with kids.

31:53.400 --> 31:57.100
You have, uh, nice--lots of room,
you have a beautiful draft morning, noon, and night,

31:57.200 --> 32:00.800
and there's no view, which, in this neighborhood,
is a huge selling point.

32:00.900 --> 32:03.200
You know,I can smell the
cats. I just can't see them.

32:03.300 --> 32:05.300
Well, you know what, if they
smell like puke, it's you, tom.

32:05.400 --> 32:07.900
- Hey, where are these cats?
- What are you asking me for?

32:08.000 --> 32:11.100
Come on, franco, the one time we
actually need you to find pussy...

32:13.600 --> 32:15.700
- Holy christ, what's this?
- Everybody all right?

32:16.900 --> 32:20.100
- You all right, big guy?
- Whoa! Mikey, you all right?

32:21.300 --> 32:24.100
- God, man!
- Whoa! All right!

32:36.000 --> 32:37.200
*Remember...

32:47.600 --> 32:49.400

33:19.200 --> 33:22.100

33:26.200 --> 33:29.000
*why don't you dance with me?

33:29.100 --> 33:32.500
*I'm not no limburger

33:38.800 --> 33:41.600
*why don't you dance with me?

33:41.700 --> 33:45.600
*I'm not no limburger

33:50.000 --> 33:51.400
*oh, yes, sir,

33:51.500 --> 33:54.300
*why don't you dance with me?

33:54.900 --> 33:57.600
*I'm not no limburger

34:04.900 --> 34:06.400
Get him up, get him away from the building.

34:07.500 --> 34:09.600
Come on, tommy, we got to get out of here.
Come on, buddy.

34:13.900 --> 34:15.000
Shit!

34:17.400 --> 34:18.400
What the hell happened?

34:18.500 --> 34:23.100
Well, the floor went and took
part of the exterior wall with it.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.699
We slid right out of the
side of the goddamn building.

34:25.800 --> 34:28.500
Yeah, thank god for all these stuffed
animals, man. We'd have been dead.

34:28.600 --> 34:31.400
- What's with him?
- Oh, he took a 2x4 to the balls when he landed

34:31.500 --> 34:37.600
First a colonoscopy, and then a 2x4.
Busy day for this kid's taint.Incoming!

34:38.800 --> 34:39.800
Jesus christ.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.800
Well,at least we saved some of these cats,
you know?

34:43.000 --> 34:46.699
I got one. How many did we get altogether
you think? Wait a second, where'd he go?

34:46.800 --> 34:49.500
- Yeah, tommy's got one.
- Well, that's 2. That's pretty good.

34:52.199 --> 34:56.000
Well, you know, one's good.One's good.

34:57.700 --> 35:02.900
- Man, hey. I think the power's back, guys.
- Oh, nice--heat! Very nice.

35:03.400 --> 35:05.200
- Hey, boys, how's it going?
- Hey, hey, hey!

35:05.400 --> 35:08.800
Yeah. Had a buddy of mine
owed me a favor over at con ed.

35:08.900 --> 35:11.100
Had him come and rehook the
whole neighborhood grid up.

35:11.500 --> 35:14.300
Another guy I know came and
kick-startd the boiler downstairs.

35:14.400 --> 35:17.200
Tom, your wife called.
I sent that same guy over to your building,

35:17.400 --> 35:19.900
- and the heat's up and running there good, too.
- Nice.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.300
- You want some coffee, boys?
- Yeah.

35:21.400 --> 35:23.300
There's a fresh pot in there with
some hot pizza in the kitchen.

35:23.500 --> 35:25.400
- All right! Thanks, chief.
- Chief is back.

35:25.500 --> 35:26.500
- Good man.
- All right.

35:26.600 --> 35:27.600
- Looking good, chief.
- Thanks.

35:27.700 --> 35:30.300
- Hey, jerry.
- Yeah, chief?

35:30.500 --> 35:32.800
Uh, I had a propane heater out here.

35:32.900 --> 35:34.800
- Yeah, down in the basement.
- Thank you.

35:39.600 --> 35:41.500
- Fun fact about propane--
- Pizza.

35:47.700 --> 35:50.800
Saw you by sheila's old place the other day.
How's damien doing?

35:51.100 --> 35:54.000
He's doing all right. He's like living
in a studio over by N.Y.U.,You know.

35:54.100 --> 35:57.700
Yeah, it's got to be tough for him not having
his mom around to do everything for him.

35:57.900 --> 35:59.700
- Welcome to real life.
- Yeah, no shit.

35:59.900 --> 36:02.000
All right,fellas,
here's the deal on the hoops situation.

36:02.100 --> 36:04.200
- Oh, we took a vote, chief.
- No, there is no vote.

36:04.300 --> 36:06.000
What do you think this is, a goddamn democracy?

36:06.300 --> 36:08.300
I come back to full duty in 2 weeks,

36:08.400 --> 36:12.400
and I don't want to listen to the hockey half of
the house bitching and moaning about the b-ball half.

36:12.600 --> 36:13.700
So I solved it.

36:14.200 --> 36:19.000
Engine company's downstairs right now
putting up one hoop and one hockey goal.

36:19.100 --> 36:21.800
Ok, so let me get this straight.
Let me get this straight.We're going halfsies?

36:21.900 --> 36:24.400
Halfsies it is. End of discussion.

36:24.600 --> 36:28.500
Now I'm going home so this goddamn
pizza isn't throwing me off my diet.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.200
- Enjoy, boys.
- You're the man, chief.

36:32.300 --> 36:34.000
You're the man.

36:38.300 --> 36:43.700
I think what makes the most sense, and I've
been trying to piece the evening together,

36:43.800 --> 36:49.200
is that she must have drugged me.
I think--

36:49.600 --> 36:53.600
she couldn't get me to commit or
submit to what she wanted,which was,

36:54.000 --> 36:57.600
you know, for me to give up my job as a
fireman and to move into this house with her.

36:57.700 --> 36:59.400
And I'll tell you something else--I'm--

36:59.900 --> 37:03.400
she mu she must have forged my
name on documents for that house.

37:03.600 --> 37:08.300
What, um, what substance do you
believe she might have drugged you with?

37:13.800 --> 37:15.200
But I...

37:19.300 --> 37:21.100
...Viagra or something.

37:21.600 --> 37:22.700
- I'm not going to say that.
- Just say it.

37:22.800 --> 37:24.100
- I'm not saying it.
- Say it.

37:24.200 --> 37:25.700
- I'm not.
- Say it.

37:25.800 --> 37:27.600
- Get out of here.
- Say it, wimp.

37:31.600 --> 37:34.900
- Hey, hey.
- Oh, sorry, hey,it's me.

37:35.300 --> 37:36.400
- Hey.
- Hi.

37:36.700 --> 37:38.600
- Hi.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you,

37:38.700 --> 37:41.100
but it seemed like you were
having a really bad dream,so...

37:41.200 --> 37:42.900
Oh, I was, yeah.

37:44.800 --> 37:48.900
- You ok?
- Yeah. Oh, nice dress.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.600
Oh--thank you.

37:51.800 --> 37:55.100
I am, um,going to wear it to the dinner,
so I'm glad you like it.

37:55.200 --> 37:58.200
I got it at barney'S. Usually I don't go there
'cause it's, you know,too fancy,

37:58.300 --> 38:00.300
but there's a warehouse sale twice a year,

38:00.300 --> 38:04.100
so I bought this and another one
that I may wear,but probably this one.

38:04.200 --> 38:06.200
- Um, dinner.
- Yeah, next tuesday night.

38:06.300 --> 38:11.000
- Do my knees look chubby in this?
- Uh, no. No.

38:11.500 --> 38:13.300
It's a little spanish place downtown

38:13.400 --> 38:15.600
and it's very, very expensive, and you're paying.

38:15.700 --> 38:20.000
Oh, ok. Now, this is...tuesday?

38:21.300 --> 38:23.400
We're going out?

38:26.300 --> 38:28.900
You know, after I saved your life,

38:29.300 --> 38:31.600
you asked me if there was
anything that you could do for me

38:31.700 --> 38:34.600
- and I said,"yes, you can take me to dinner."
- I--yeah.

38:34.700 --> 38:38.500
Really haven't mentio so I decided
to take the bull by the horns

38:38.600 --> 38:40.700
and wrestle it to the ground--give me your hand.

38:43.900 --> 38:47.400
Look, it's very difficult
for me to get into the city.

38:47.500 --> 38:51.200
So I need a few days notice.
So tuesday night--say it.

38:51.300 --> 38:52.700
- What?
- Tuesday night--say it.

38:52.800 --> 38:54.800
- Yes. Ow, tuesday. Tuesday.
- tuesday night

38:55.100 --> 38:56.900
- Tuesday, 7:00.
- Ok--

38:57.000 --> 38:59.500
- jesus. Ow.
- No excuses.

38:59.600 --> 39:02.500
- Ok, but--
- Ok. Listen, I'll call you tuesday at 6:00

39:02.600 --> 39:07.700
and I will give you the name
and the address of the place, and, uh, toodles.

39:07.800 --> 39:09.700
Ok, ok, you know, I have a brand-new baby at home.

39:09.800 --> 39:13.600
- Yeah, I don't care.
- Uh, ok. And, you know, I have a wife.

39:13.700 --> 39:15.900
-Tell me--an ex-wife.
- But she lives with me.

39:16.000 --> 39:20.100

39:20.700 --> 39:22.400
Are you sure you want to do his?

39:22.600 --> 39:27.900
Yes, I--I've been thinking a lot about it and
I think that the fact that you like porn is,um,

39:28.700 --> 39:32.600
really special,so I want to do it for us,you know?

39:32.700 --> 39:35.200
Rather than be freaked out by it,
I want to just embrace it,you know?

39:35.300 --> 39:36.800
I mean, you like some of my hobbies.

39:37.300 --> 39:42.200
- Like what?
- Uh, you know...walking.

39:42.800 --> 39:45.000
Um, and my trains. You really--

39:45.200 --> 39:48.400

but I am going to do it for us.

39:48.500 --> 39:49.900
- Ok.
- Ok, here we go.Ready?

39:50.100 --> 39:51.300
Ok.

39:51.700 --> 39:55.400

- Uh, he called.He's at the center.

40:06.200 --> 40:08.300
He's got some new friend down there or something.

40:08.400 --> 40:09.700
Oh, right.

40:10.000 --> 40:13.700
So, uh, I guess that means, you and me,
we havesome alone time, right?

40:13.900 --> 40:17.000
- I'm reading, franco.
- Oh, come on, you want to fool around?

40:17.700 --> 40:19.300
I'm in the middle of a chapter.

40:19.400 --> 40:21.200
Well, you know what?
I'm in the middle of a chapter, too.

40:21.300 --> 40:24.400
It's chapter 7, actually--franco needs sex.

40:25.300 --> 40:28.400
Oh, ok, well, let's skip to another chapter.
What's chapter 2?

40:28.500 --> 40:31.700
Uh, franco needs sex.
Don't even ask about the other chapters.

40:31.800 --> 40:33.400
- They're all franco needs sex.
- That's right.

40:33.500 --> 40:37.500
Except for the last chapter,
which is franco falls asleep after sex.

40:38.500 --> 40:40.700
- Come on, baby.
- Uh, I'm almost done reading.

40:40.800 --> 40:42.200
Give me 15 minutes.

40:44.600 --> 40:47.200
You know, I, uh,I almost died today.

40:48.100 --> 40:51.300
- What?
- Yeah. Yeah, we were in this,uh,this warehouse.

40:51.400 --> 40:53.500
You know,the whole floor just--just collapsed.

40:53.600 --> 40:55.200
It was a really weird fire.

40:55.500 --> 40:58.800
If the side of the building hadn't blown out,
the whole crew--we'd all be toast.

40:59.200 --> 41:02.800
Oh, my god. You poor guy.

41:04.200 --> 41:05.900
Oh, come here.

41:11.700 --> 41:14.500
...guess I have to almost die more often, huh?

41:23.500 --> 41:25.100
Oh, my god, that's so phony.

41:25.200 --> 41:27.300
Maggie, come on--she's totally acting.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.300
I've been with a lot of girls in my life
and I've never heard a woman moan like that,ever.

41:31.400 --> 41:32.600
- No kidding.
- What?

41:32.700 --> 41:33.700
Nothing.

41:33.800 --> 41:35.400
Oh, and now the other guy shows up?Come on.

41:35.500 --> 41:38.700
He's going to join in?
That never happens.That's ridiculous.

41:38.900 --> 41:40.700
What the hell's he going
to do with the pepper mill?

41:41.400 --> 41:45.200
- Sean, that's not a pepper mill.
- Oh, my god. Oh!

41:59.100 --> 42:00.500
So what are you going to say?

42:01.000 --> 42:02.800
Well, I guess we're going to find out,huh?

42:03.500 --> 42:05.500
You could just tell the truth.

42:06.500 --> 42:08.600
Which would be what?

42:09.200 --> 42:13.400
That you were shit-faced and horny,
and then we she got pissy and afraid,

42:13.500 --> 42:16.300
- you started pushing her around and telling her--
- That's not what happened,ok?

42:16.400 --> 42:18.300
- That's not the truth.
- Don't talk over me now.

42:18.400 --> 42:20.400
- Don't talk over me!
- What are you doing, jimmy?

42:20.500 --> 42:21.600
