and this is the eighth time.

40:26.598 --> 40:29.122
That's Interrogation
Tactics 101.

40:29.165 --> 40:31.733
But every hour you
detain me here unlawfully

40:31.777 --> 40:33.474
is going to cost
the city of New Orleans

40:33.518 --> 40:36.956
thousands of taxpayer dollars
when I sue your asses.

40:36.999 --> 40:40.350
The quarter ounce of weed
you found is a misdemeanor,

40:40.394 --> 40:42.135
for which, normally,
I would've been ticketed

40:42.178 --> 40:44.616
and made to pay a fine,
based on Louisiana state laws

40:44.659 --> 40:46.487
and local
New Orleans ordinances.

40:46.531 --> 40:49.098
But, as I stated before,
I have a medical use card,

40:49.142 --> 40:51.927
and I'm sure you know that.

40:51.971 --> 40:53.581
Because I keep it
in the same place

40:53.625 --> 40:56.584
where I keep
the marijuana you found.

40:56.628 --> 40:57.759
So, really,
this is nothing more

40:57.803 --> 40:59.369
than the state
abusing its power

40:59.413 --> 41:01.676
and punishing me
for my voice.

41:01.720 --> 41:04.462
But I've grown tired
of this harassment.

41:04.505 --> 41:06.507
So, yes.

41:06.551 --> 41:10.163
I am ready to go home.

41:10.206 --> 41:11.991
Release me!
