(THEME SONG PLAYING)

00:31.000 --> 00:32.634
(CHUCKLING)

00:32.701 --> 00:34.868
-(DAWN TALKING INDISTINCTLY) -It's 9:50, you know that?

00:34.934 --> 00:36.300
-Pardon? -It's 9:50.

00:36.367 --> 00:39.634
-Well, I can't speak... Here he is. -Hiya.

00:39.701 --> 00:41.500
Hiya. Nice jacket.

00:41.567 --> 00:43.701
-Whatever. -Looks a bit like mine.

00:43.767 --> 00:45.901
-What make's yours? -Armani.

00:45.968 --> 00:47.667
-Expensive. -And yours?

00:47.734 --> 00:49.133
Sergio Georgini.

00:49.200 --> 00:50.300
Isn't it...

00:50.367 --> 00:51.968
New shoes as well.

00:52.834 --> 00:54.868
Quite a heel on them.

00:54.934 --> 00:57.000
-We still on for 10:00? -Yup.

01:03.033 --> 01:05.300
People see me and see the suit

01:05.367 --> 01:06.801
and they go, you're not fooling anyone.

01:06.868 --> 01:08.667
They know I'm rock'n'roll through and through.

01:08.734 --> 01:11.200
But you know that old thing, "Live fast, die young"?

01:11.267 --> 01:12.434
Not my way.

01:12.500 --> 01:14.801
Live fast, sure. Live too bloody fast sometimes.

01:14.868 --> 01:16.834
But, uh, die young?

01:16.901 --> 01:18.167
Die old.

01:19.133 --> 01:21.033
That's the way.

01:21.100 --> 01:24.133
I'm not orthodox, you know. I don't live by "The rules", you know.

01:24.200 --> 01:29.100
If there's one other person who's influenced me in that way of thinking,

01:29.167 --> 01:33.167
someone who is a maverick, someone who does that to the system,

01:33.234 --> 01:36.133
then it's Ian Botham.

01:36.200 --> 01:40.133
Because Beefy will happily say,

01:40.200 --> 01:42.701
"That's what I think of your selection policy." Yeah?

01:42.767 --> 01:46.400
"Yes, I've hit the odd copper, yes, I've enjoyed the odd doobie.

01:46.467 --> 01:47.834
"But will you piss off and leave me alone?

01:47.901 --> 01:51.500
"I'm walking to John O'Groats for some spastics."

01:51.567 --> 01:53.834
You been, uh, reorganising stuff out there?

01:53.901 --> 01:56.367
-Uh, just been... -Just looks a bit chaotic, that's all.

01:56.434 --> 01:59.334
-Assimilating. -Re-assimilating. And, uh...

01:59.400 --> 02:01.133
Re-assimilating what?

02:01.200 --> 02:04.767
-Just taking on people and putting them into... -Into lots?

02:04.834 --> 02:06.968
-Yeah. Just categorising. -(CLEARS THROAT)

02:07.033 --> 02:10.200
Not in any sort of like, you know, "Label me",

02:10.267 --> 02:13.767
but, uh, just, you know, "That's your vibe. That's your vibe."

02:14.901 --> 02:17.801
-Hmm-mmm. -You know.

02:17.868 --> 02:20.634
-(LAUGHING) -What's in here, then? Let's have a look.

02:20.701 --> 02:23.534
-Oh, my God. A leather basque! -ALL: Oh!

02:23.601 --> 02:25.634
-Fantastic. -WOMAN: Ooh!

02:25.701 --> 02:28.868
I've always wanted one of these, actually. Leather Basque.

02:28.934 --> 02:31.100
-Cheers, guys. Thank you. -(WOMAN TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

02:31.167 --> 02:32.500

-(ALL LAUGHING) -WOMAN: Fantastic!

02:34.400 --> 02:35.968
(ALL COMMENTING INDISTINCTLY) (LAUGHING)

02:37.434 --> 02:40.167
You should try it on, try on properly.

02:40.234 --> 02:42.767
In case you have to take it back.

02:42.834 --> 02:44.367
-Try it on without that stuff underneath. -It fits!

02:44.434 --> 02:47.367
-Lovely. -Happy birthday.

02:47.434 --> 02:49.634
(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

02:49.701 --> 02:53.067
-Oh, my God! It's disgusting. -MAN: Even I'm shocked.

02:53.133 --> 02:54.267
(ALL LAUGHING)

02:54.334 --> 02:57.334
You dirty males! Does it work?

02:57.400 --> 02:59.734
One size fits all. (LAUGHS)

02:59.801 --> 03:01.300
Can I just... Sorry. Can I just...

03:01.367 --> 03:02.934
Look at the face. Look at the face.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.033
-Gareth, look at the face. -Ugh!

03:04.100 --> 03:05.534
I can't believe you're touching that.

03:05.601 --> 03:07.334
-Why? Look at this. -It's disgusting.

03:07.400 --> 03:08.834
You don't know where that's been, mate.

03:08.901 --> 03:10.367
Well, I do know where. It's been in the box, Gareth.

03:10.434 --> 03:11.734
No, I mean at the factory. You don't know what goes on...

03:11.801 --> 03:13.834
The factory. Your amazing mind again.

03:13.901 --> 03:16.701
In my experience, women who work in factories are slappers.

03:16.767 --> 03:18.367
So, don't know what's...

03:19.634 --> 03:21.767
Thank you, everybody, for my lovely presents.

03:23.300 --> 03:25.467
-They're malleable... -Hmm-mmm.

03:25.534 --> 03:28.234
And you know, that's what I like, really.

03:28.300 --> 03:30.234
I don't like people coming in with, uh,

03:30.300 --> 03:32.400
"Or we do it this way or we do it that way."

03:32.467 --> 03:33.767
I just want to go,

03:34.834 --> 03:36.834
"Do it this way if you like.

03:36.901 --> 03:38.534
"If you don't..."

03:38.601 --> 03:41.601
Team playing. I call it "Team individuality".

03:41.667 --> 03:43.701
It's a new... It's like a management style.

03:43.767 --> 03:47.133
-Again, guilty, unorthodox. Sue me. -It's not you...

03:47.200 --> 03:50.767
-But you know, nothing ever changes... -(CLEARS THROAT)

03:50.834 --> 03:52.467
...by staying the same.

03:53.601 --> 03:54.901
Quite literally.

03:58.467 --> 03:59.667
Hi, guys.

03:59.734 --> 04:01.067
-Hello. -Hi.

04:01.133 --> 04:02.801
-You like that, don't you? -What?

04:02.868 --> 04:04.801
Is that because it looks like yours?

04:04.868 --> 04:07.000
Yeah. It's identical, sort of.

04:07.067 --> 04:11.701
Well, mine's not that size, it's very, very tiny, but it is made of plastic.

04:11.767 --> 04:13.634
Mine's massive and it ain't made of plastic. (CHUCKLING)

04:19.868 --> 04:22.434
-I dare you to go put it in Brent's office. -(CHUCKLES)

04:22.500 --> 04:24.300
-Why? -It's a dare.

04:24.367 --> 04:26.500
Yeah, I know. But he's having a meeting with Neil, I can't...

04:26.567 --> 04:28.968
Yeah, well, it's kind of a challenge, mate.

04:29.033 --> 04:30.434
And why would I do that?

04:30.500 --> 04:31.701
'Cause it would make me laugh.

04:31.767 --> 04:33.400
-I'll do it. -No, I'll do it. It's all right.

04:33.467 --> 04:35.100
Look, all you gotta do is just, you know,

04:35.167 --> 04:37.400
go in there and hide it in there somewhere, that's all.

04:37.467 --> 04:39.868
-Just hide it? Simple. -Yeah.

04:39.934 --> 04:41.901
It couldn't be easier.

04:41.968 --> 04:43.834
Straightforward.

04:43.901 --> 04:45.500
(GIGGLING)

04:46.767 --> 04:48.100
-(KNOCKING ON DOOR) -Come in.

04:48.300 --> 04:51.734
I'm sorry to interrupt. Um, I just wondered if...

04:54.834 --> 04:57.000
That's embarrassing. I've completely forgotten what I came here for.

04:57.067 --> 04:59.133
-Oh, that's all right. -I'm sorry. Um...

04:59.200 --> 05:02.400
-Go on. -Come on, come on, Tim.

05:02.467 --> 05:05.601
-Get it back. No! -Too many late nights.

05:05.667 --> 05:07.734
-No, sorry. It's totally gone. -Don't worry about it.

05:07.801 --> 05:09.334
-I'm holding your folder. Sorry. -It's fine.

05:09.400 --> 05:13.100
Um, I just... No, it's gone. BSE. No more beef.

05:13.167 --> 05:16.100
As you're here, um... There's something you can do for me.

05:16.167 --> 05:18.667
-My lot haven't even been down to the warehouse here. -Okay.

05:18.734 --> 05:21.267
-Um, it'd be... Would you mind taking them down? -Not at all.

05:21.334 --> 05:23.167
-There's not a lot to see. -Well, you know,

05:23.234 --> 05:25.133
in one organisation, I think it could be a good idea

05:25.200 --> 05:26.500
for everyone to know everyone else.

05:26.567 --> 05:27.901
If you just tell Glynn I said it's okay.

05:28.100 --> 05:30.801
(STAMMERING) Tell Taffy

05:30.868 --> 05:33.634
that I said it was okay and that Neil agrees with me.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.200
Okay. Cool.

05:35.267 --> 05:36.767
-That's great. Thanks, Tim. -All right.

05:42.100 --> 05:44.667
-I'm sorry. That was brilliant. -That was absolutely...

05:44.734 --> 05:47.100
-Did you see where it went? Went under the folder. -(GIGGLES)

05:52.033 --> 05:55.100
-Gareth, out of 10? -Give it a three.

05:55.167 --> 05:56.334
-Three? -Three?

05:58.601 --> 06:00.634
Yeah, I just wanted to make an enquiry about the order.

06:04.067 --> 06:06.334
You can't beat a bit of bully!

06:06.400 --> 06:09.033
Bulls-eye. Here they are. Likely lads.

06:09.100 --> 06:11.434
-Hi. -New shoes?

06:12.567 --> 06:14.534
-Fashion. -Do you want a go?

06:14.601 --> 06:16.200
Yeah.

06:16.267 --> 06:18.300
Up to the oche. Let Tony look after you.

06:18.367 --> 06:20.968
-(ALL LAUGH) -Oh, dear.

06:21.033 --> 06:22.901
Nothing in this game for two in a bed.

06:25.734 --> 06:27.901
(CLATTERING)

06:27.968 --> 06:30.067
Shit flights on those, are they? No wonder.

06:30.133 --> 06:34.133
Oh, a bit fuddy-duddy, darts, for a couple of young lads?

06:34.200 --> 06:37.167
-Not young. 29. -Ooh. Over the hill.

06:37.234 --> 06:39.167
How old would you say I was, if you didn't know me?

06:41.434 --> 06:43.567
-40? -No. How old do you think I look?

06:43.634 --> 06:45.701
No, um...

06:45.767 --> 06:48.100
-39. -Most people think I look about 30. So...

06:48.167 --> 06:50.400
-Definitely not. -Oh, you're calling them liars?

06:51.334 --> 06:53.534
Maybe... What do you think?

06:53.601 --> 06:56.801
-Well, between 30 and 40. -Yes.

06:57.968 --> 06:59.367
More honest.

(MOTOR WHIRRS)

07:12.701 --> 07:16.300
Okay. Uh, now guys, we're about to enter a warehouse environment.

07:16.367 --> 07:19.033
Now, I must warn you, some of the people here will be working-class.

07:19.100 --> 07:22.133
-(LAUGHING) -There may be arse-cleavage, so...

07:22.200 --> 07:24.667
-Ooh! -Just, uh, find a partner.

07:24.734 --> 07:27.367
Uh, hold hands. Don't talk to anyone, though. Okay?

07:27.434 --> 07:29.701
Are you cheering? All right. Okay. Let's go.

-Hi. -Working hard as usual.

07:47.500 --> 07:50.968
-The stripper's arrived. -(ALL LAUGHING)

07:51.033 --> 07:53.868
I'll tell you what. I'm gonna give you five minutes, but no touching.

07:53.934 --> 07:55.934
I always knew you were bent.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.300
Mate, don't worry. She'll get the old knookers out for a tenner.

07:58.367 --> 08:00.067
-Fuck off. -(MEN LAUGHING)

Oi, lend us a tenner! (LAUGHS)

08:06.200 --> 08:07.500
You won't see them tonight.

08:07.567 --> 08:09.133
That's all right. I've got cable.

08:13.267 --> 08:16.234
Okay, um...

08:16.300 --> 08:18.901
I'm gonna show you this aisle first.

-Bender! -(MEN TITTERING)

(SNORTS) No!

-David. This is Ray and Jude. -Yeah?

08:46.667 --> 08:49.334
Um, Ray and Jude... Sorry. Forgotten where you're from.

08:49.400 --> 08:52.200
Uh, from Cooper & Webb consultants.

08:52.267 --> 08:54.033
Who's Cooper and who's Webb?

08:54.100 --> 08:55.434
Neither of us.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.634
I bet you get that all the time, do you?

08:57.701 --> 08:59.033
No.

08:59.734 --> 09:01.868
Um, anyway, uh...

09:03.200 --> 09:04.901
First things first. Any more mail?

09:07.901 --> 09:09.934
"Mr D. Brent." That's me.

(DOOR OPENS)

09:38.801 --> 09:40.133
Oh...

09:47.634 --> 09:50.000
Must just...

09:50.667 --> 09:52.267
Uh, always...

09:59.767 --> 10:01.767
Shoot.

10:01.834 --> 10:05.033
-Well, uh, are you aware of what we do? -No.

10:05.100 --> 10:11.033
Basically, uh, we organise training days for corporations and individuals

10:11.100 --> 10:14.033
who pay to get an advantage in business.

10:14.100 --> 10:16.701
Um, but it's not just telling them boring facts.

10:16.767 --> 10:19.767
We also have business experts who train them how to act,

10:19.834 --> 10:22.334
how to walk into a room and say, "I'm the guy you gotta do business with."

10:22.400 --> 10:23.934
Okay. I'm gonna stop you there.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.500
I really don't need anything like that.

10:25.567 --> 10:27.834
I do all my own in-house training.

10:27.901 --> 10:29.367
Sorry. No, no, sorry.

10:29.434 --> 10:31.234
Uh, we're not trying to get your business.

10:31.300 --> 10:34.267
We very much like you to be one of our experts.

10:35.500 --> 10:38.601
Mmm. Good choice.

10:38.667 --> 10:40.734
Why did you dudes swing by here in the first place?

10:40.801 --> 10:42.534
Well we'd heard a lot of good things about Wernham Hogg.

10:42.601 --> 10:45.868
We also got your name from a guy we work with called Andy Hitchcock.

10:45.934 --> 10:47.667
Oh, God.

10:47.734 --> 10:51.634
Oh, that Cockles. Cocky. The Big Cock.

10:51.701 --> 10:53.434
Uh, next time you're talking to him,

10:53.500 --> 10:55.701
just ask him if he got the grass stains out of his trousers.

10:55.767 --> 10:57.667
Not in front of his wife, 'cause...

10:59.067 --> 11:00.367
'Cause... Was...

11:03.634 --> 11:06.300
What sort of tip would you want me on first?

11:06.367 --> 11:07.734
We're looking for people who are dynamic,

11:07.801 --> 11:09.467
but who are also good communicators.

11:09.534 --> 11:12.234
-Sure. -It's a corporate message, but...

11:12.300 --> 11:15.601
Obviously, we're after people who can communicate with young people, uh, 20-somethings.

11:21.367 --> 11:24.100
-You don't see heels like those much nowadays. -You can still find them.

11:24.167 --> 11:25.701
Um...

11:25.767 --> 11:28.133
-What sort of bunse are we looking at? -Sorry?

11:29.434 --> 11:32.334
-Um, well, to start with... -Bunsen burner.

11:35.767 --> 11:39.467
Bunsen burner, nice little earner. Hence the...

11:42.534 --> 11:44.200
Bunse.

11:44.267 --> 11:47.334
Uh, well, to begin with we'd put you on about £300.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.434
£300? Just for an hour's work?

11:49.500 --> 11:51.801
Well, no. You'd only talk for about 15 minutes.

11:51.868 --> 11:55.467
(LAUGHS) Fifteen minutes! That's...

11:55.534 --> 11:57.934
That's £1,200 an hour pro rata.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.601
That's the sort of fee I'd be looking at for this, so, you know... Yeah.

12:02.667 --> 12:05.234
-When would you want to do it? -Well, soon.

12:06.167 --> 12:08.734
Count me in. Thank you.

12:08.801 --> 12:11.200
Sorry, do you have a diary? We could make some dates now.

12:11.267 --> 12:14.334
Absolutement. Uh, what's that?

12:15.667 --> 12:17.500
-It's a dildo. -Is it yours?

12:17.567 --> 12:21.934
-No! -No. No. Wow. I don't know... Sorry.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.667
This is an example of problems. Let's have a look.

12:27.567 --> 12:29.934
Okay, everybody.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.367
What am I doing in there with a dildo?

12:34.434 --> 12:39.000
She says it's not hers and I for one believe her. So whose is it?

12:41.901 --> 12:45.701
Right. What's it doing in there?

12:45.767 --> 12:49.834
It was a birthday present, um, but I don't know what it's doing in there.

12:49.901 --> 12:53.467
Okay. So, good harmless fun. But, you know...

12:53.534 --> 12:55.434
Is it today your birthday? Many happy returns.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.400
But, what have we learnt from this?

12:59.334 --> 13:01.834
Not to leave your dildo lying around?

13:01.901 --> 13:05.133
Don't let it out of your sight because it can wind up anywhere.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.400
-(BUZZING) -Oh. What's that?

13:10.767 --> 13:12.200
Just...

13:13.133 --> 13:15.200
Sorry. How do you...

13:15.267 --> 13:17.834
Oh, it's worse. Now, what do you do when that happens?

13:17.901 --> 13:19.434
Well, you probably like...

13:19.500 --> 13:23.767
Just can you get that, make sure that gets back to...

13:23.834 --> 13:27.067
-Can we put some dates in? -Yeah, sure. We're actually in the middle of something.

13:27.133 --> 13:28.567
So and that...

13:31.734 --> 13:33.334
(ALL MUMBLING)

13:44.000 --> 13:47.534
-You've got to smuggle this somewhere about your person. -(LAUGHS)

13:47.601 --> 13:48.901
I'm not saying anything about...

13:48.968 --> 13:51.234
Well, tell me about you first.

13:51.300 --> 13:53.100
If you want to see bravery, come to me. I'll do a dare.

13:53.167 --> 13:55.100
-Bravery? Oh, yeah. -Yeah, come on.

13:55.167 --> 13:57.367
Okay, okay. You know what? Okay.

13:57.434 --> 13:59.167
I'm gonna phone... No.

13:59.234 --> 14:01.467
I'm going to write things for you to say. Now come here.

14:01.534 --> 14:05.601
And then I'm gonna phone David and I want you to say exactly what I write down, okay?

14:05.667 --> 14:07.100
-No way. You'll make me sound like a bender. -(DIAL TONE)

14:07.167 --> 14:09.167
No, look. I swear I won't.

14:09.234 --> 14:10.567
-No way, no. -It'll just be...

14:10.634 --> 14:12.534
It'll just be funny things. It'll come out cute.

14:12.601 --> 14:14.767
I'm not. I'm not gonna say anything that makes me sound like a bender.

14:14.834 --> 14:16.500
-DAVID: Hello? -Hi, it's Gareth.

14:16.567 --> 14:18.834
Hiya. I'm in a meeting at the moment, Gareth.

14:18.901 --> 14:22.234
Yeah. Um, just gonna say a few things.

14:23.167 --> 14:24.300
All right.

14:24.367 --> 14:26.968
You're... You're doing a great job.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.100
Okay.

14:29.167 --> 14:33.033
Just an employee saying what a superb job I'm doing. Is that it?

14:33.100 --> 14:35.901
No. I like your little beard.

14:37.968 --> 14:39.200
Okay. Is that it?

14:39.267 --> 14:40.968
(STAMMERING) One more thing.

14:41.033 --> 14:42.567
-What? -Um...

14:43.801 --> 14:45.634
You should wear tighter trousers.

14:48.834 --> 14:50.467
-Can I give you a call back? -Yeah. Bye.

14:55.267 --> 14:58.701
-That was genius! Genius. Genius. -GARETH: Thank you.

15:08.734 --> 15:10.267
Brilliant.

15:13.300 --> 15:16.167
We have a website with profiles of all our speakers on them.

15:16.234 --> 15:18.834
-Would you mind answering a few questions? -No. Go for it.

15:18.901 --> 15:20.367
Okay.

15:20.434 --> 15:22.534
If you could have a working lunch with anyone,

15:22.601 --> 15:24.767
living or dead, who would it be?

15:27.901 --> 15:29.801
Martin Luther King

15:29.868 --> 15:32.367
and the Dalai Lama.

15:32.434 --> 15:34.467
And Rory Bremner.

15:34.534 --> 15:37.834
Just, uh, 'cause they could get a bit heavy, couldn't they, the two of them?

15:37.901 --> 15:39.100
And he'd lighten things up.

15:39.167 --> 15:41.400
Probably do impressions of them. And me. (LAUGHS)

15:44.067 --> 15:45.701
What's your biggest disappointment?

15:47.334 --> 15:50.267
-Alton Towers. -Oh.

15:50.334 --> 15:52.701
-I've never been. -It's rubbish. Next.

15:56.634 --> 15:58.367
-Hello. -Hiya.

15:59.267 --> 16:02.300
Still doing practical jokes?

16:02.367 --> 16:04.500
I'm trying to do some work now. Should be giving them a rest.

16:04.567 --> 16:06.934
-Ooh! I've got some. -Have you?

16:07.000 --> 16:08.701
-Yeah. -What you got?

16:09.734 --> 16:11.767
Oh...

16:13.100 --> 16:16.367
I used to do loads... What were they?

16:17.901 --> 16:21.033
Ah, you know. We can... We can think of some.

16:21.100 --> 16:22.167
We can... Yeah, absolutely.

16:22.234 --> 16:23.734
-Some new ones. -Yeah, okay.

16:23.801 --> 16:25.367
-Let's think of some good ones. -For...

16:25.434 --> 16:27.567
-For... Hmm. What about Gareth? -Hmm.

16:27.634 --> 16:30.067
It's about time he had some tricks played on him, I think.

16:30.968 --> 16:32.734
What would your motto be?

16:33.834 --> 16:35.200
(WHISPERS) My motto be.

16:35.267 --> 16:38.000
Well, I've noticed that some bosses are intimidated

16:38.067 --> 16:40.133
by training their staff up too well.

16:40.200 --> 16:44.767
They don't... I don't mind it. I actually like my staff to be better than me.

16:44.834 --> 16:49.801
That way, you know, keeps me on my toes. So my motto would be,

16:49.868 --> 16:55.500
be careful 'cause there's always someone ready to step into your shoes

16:55.567 --> 16:57.734
and do your job better...

16:57.801 --> 17:00.934
than...you...do it.

17:04.801 --> 17:07.100
Heh, heh.

17:07.167 --> 17:09.467
-I'm gluing the phone. -(CHUCKLING)

17:10.968 --> 17:13.234
-In the name of fun. -He will hate you.

17:18.968 --> 17:21.467
(ALL CHEERING)

17:26.467 --> 17:28.133
-What's in it, do you know? -It's, uh...

17:28.200 --> 17:30.167
-What's this? -WOMAN: You cooked it.

17:30.234 --> 17:33.100
Sorry, it's just, uh, little birthday bash for Trudy. It's her birthday.

17:33.167 --> 17:34.567
Who organised this?

17:34.634 --> 17:35.834
I did.

17:37.267 --> 17:39.267
Bit over the top, isn't it?

17:39.334 --> 17:42.601
-How much did that cost you? We paying you too much? -I made it myself.

17:42.667 --> 17:45.667
-Made it yourself? -Every year he does it.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.667
Oh. Bit sweet, innit? Too rich.

17:49.734 --> 17:51.667
That's really nice.

17:51.734 --> 17:52.567
You ought to taste the lemon drizzle cake, it's even better.

17:52.634 --> 17:54.033
(LAUGHS)

17:54.100 --> 17:55.968
I prefer a flan.

17:58.734 --> 18:00.667
Whoo!

18:00.734 --> 18:01.968
(LAUGHTER)

18:03.968 --> 18:05.968
-(ALL TALKING INDISTINCTLY) -She's a prude, but...

18:06.033 --> 18:07.801
-No, she's not. -She is.

18:07.868 --> 18:09.801
What, for real? Really?

18:11.868 --> 18:14.167
I'll be 40? (LAUGHS)

18:14.234 --> 18:17.601
It's true. It's true. I mean, every time that does happen...

18:17.667 --> 18:19.300
So, what, are you in a meeting?

18:19.367 --> 18:21.801
(STAMMERING) I've just had an interesting meeting.

18:21.868 --> 18:24.434
See those two people over there? They're business people.

18:24.500 --> 18:26.367
And, uh, they're quite important, actually.

18:26.434 --> 18:28.067
And they got a business and they, uh,

18:28.133 --> 18:31.667
they arrange sort of seminars, management training seminars

18:31.734 --> 18:34.934
where they get expert speakers to come and try to sort of...

18:35.000 --> 18:36.834
John Harvey-Jones type figures.

18:36.901 --> 18:38.267
They've asked me.

18:38.334 --> 18:40.033
So... Yeah.

18:40.100 --> 18:42.200
Uh, it's perfect for me, though, 'cause not only

18:42.400 --> 18:44.901
do I know about that sort of stuff, I've got a sort of natural authority with people,

18:44.968 --> 18:49.300
but, um, I'm an all-round entertainer, so they, you know...

18:49.367 --> 18:53.234
Those qualities. Keep it under your hat. Okay?

18:54.734 --> 18:57.734
See those two business people over there?

19:03.167 --> 19:04.734
(PHONE RINGS)

19:12.834 --> 19:14.567
-Is that you? -Yeah.

19:14.634 --> 19:16.567
-You're funny. Could have had my eye out. -(LAUGHS)

19:21.067 --> 19:22.601
-Hello. Gareth Keenan. -Cock!

19:26.067 --> 19:28.434
Thank you. Thank you.

19:28.500 --> 19:32.100
Oh, glorious! Did you see that? He still picked it up.

19:32.167 --> 19:34.634
-Was that you? (LAUGHS) -We glued it.

19:34.701 --> 19:37.267
Was that... (LAUGHS)

19:37.334 --> 19:39.400
Was that like superglue? Oh, my God.

19:39.467 --> 19:42.267
-(WOMAN TALKS INDISTINCTLY) -Oh. Yes.

19:42.334 --> 19:44.667
All right. Obviously, it wouldn't take very much of your time. Just...

19:44.734 --> 19:48.400
I really appreciate your interest, but I'm just so busy at the moment...

19:48.467 --> 19:49.868
What are we talking about? What are we talking about?

19:49.934 --> 19:51.901
Uh, we're just trying to involve this chap in motivation.

19:51.968 --> 19:54.901
-Oh, after you've asked me. It's a bit rude, innit? -A bit rude?

19:54.968 --> 19:56.634
Oh, no. We'd use both of you for different seminars.

19:56.701 --> 19:58.300
-I can do them both. -I can't, yeah.

19:58.367 --> 20:00.167
-Anyway. -I can't do it anyway.

20:00.234 --> 20:01.534
-Can I have your card anyway, just in case? -No point. Is there?

20:01.601 --> 20:03.400
We thought we might be able to persuade you.

20:03.467 --> 20:05.734
Well, he said no once. If he goes back on it, he's weak. Innit?

20:07.067 --> 20:08.634
So...

20:08.701 --> 20:09.901
Well, anyway, we ought to be going.

20:09.968 --> 20:12.033
Yeah. Leave it as it was. Yeah, as agreed.

20:12.100 --> 20:13.400
-Okay. -We'll be in touch.

20:13.467 --> 20:16.701
-Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. Bye.

20:16.767 --> 20:20.701
-Oh. So you're definitely not doing it, you said. So... -(CLEARS THROAT)

20:20.767 --> 20:22.167
I thought you were trying to worm your way in.

20:22.234 --> 20:25.334
-No. I'm not interested. -Why? Beneath you, is it?

20:25.400 --> 20:27.734
No. I just don't think you can teach people that sort of thing.

20:27.801 --> 20:29.834
-Either you can do it or you can't. -Well...

20:29.901 --> 20:32.500
-Depends who the guru is. So... -Yeah.

20:32.567 --> 20:34.767
-Beware of false prophets. (LAUGHS) -No.

20:34.834 --> 20:38.634
That's my point. Innit? It's not all about profits. So...

20:38.701 --> 20:42.067
-I meant prophets, as in... -I meant, I meant. If only, if only.

20:42.133 --> 20:44.067
If only me auntie had bollocks, she'd be me uncle.

20:48.634 --> 20:50.701
(MAN LAUGHING)

20:52.400 --> 20:54.601
Every time in one.

20:54.667 --> 20:57.334
-Okay Top Trumps. -Top Trumps.

20:57.400 --> 20:59.133
-Pop stars? -I'm in. Pop stars.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.634
-Right. Do you know how to play? -Yeah...

21:01.701 --> 21:03.167
No. I don't talk about my love life

21:03.234 --> 21:04.701
for a very good reason.

21:04.767 --> 21:07.901
And that reason is, I don't have one. Um...

21:08.133 --> 21:11.667
Which is good news for the ladies, I suppose. I am still available.

21:11.734 --> 21:14.267
Uh, I'm a heck of a catch. 'Cause... Let's look at it...

21:14.334 --> 21:18.467
I live in Slough, in a lovely house...

21:18.534 --> 21:21.701
With my parents. (CHUCKLES)

21:21.767 --> 21:25.667
I have my own room, which I've had since, yeah, since I was born.

21:25.734 --> 21:28.901
Um... That's seen a lot of action, I tell you.

21:28.968 --> 21:31.300
Mainly dusting. But, uh...

21:31.367 --> 21:33.767
I went to university for a year as well,

21:33.834 --> 21:37.334
before I dropped out, so I'm a quitter.

21:37.400 --> 21:40.801
Uh, so, yeah, form an orderly queue, ladies.

21:40.868 --> 21:42.567
Look at him though.

21:42.634 --> 21:45.100
It... Right. I've been on safari

21:45.167 --> 21:46.901
-and I've never seen anything like that. -(LAUGHS)

21:46.968 --> 21:48.400
That's preposterous.

21:48.467 --> 21:51.701
-I've got 94. I have got 94! -(WOMAN LAUGHING)

21:51.767 --> 21:53.634
No. I do.

21:53.701 --> 21:56.901
-Well, I've been known to do that. -(LAUGHING)

21:56.968 --> 21:59.334
-Are you complaining? -No, I'm not complaining.

21:59.400 --> 22:02.701
Number of haircuts. Is that a valid thing?

22:02.767 --> 22:04.601
-One. -Are you getting mullered?

22:04.667 --> 22:07.167
-Not really. -Right. You've spilt some on your...

22:07.234 --> 22:08.968
-Yeah, I know I have. -Right.

22:09.033 --> 22:10.500
-Shall we carry on with the game, please? -I want to carry on.

22:10.567 --> 22:11.701
-I wish you would. -(LAUGHS)

22:11.767 --> 22:14.667
Shh... Can I have a sh... Pop act?

22:14.734 --> 22:17.234
But if they wanna pay me that for...

22:17.300 --> 22:18.868
For 15 minutes work, that is their...

22:18.934 --> 22:20.767
-(MOBILE RINGS) -Oh, sorry...

22:22.300 --> 22:24.267
Chris Finch. (CHUCKLES)

22:24.334 --> 22:28.634
Finchy! All right? Go on.

22:28.701 --> 22:31.167
What's the difference between a fox and a dog? Go on.

22:32.634 --> 22:35.500
About eight pints of lager.

22:35.567 --> 22:38.701
It's party time here, mate. You coming in?

22:38.767 --> 22:41.200
-Why not? -'Cause I'm already here, you fat twat!

22:41.267 --> 22:43.167
Hey, Finchy. Chris Finchy. Here he is.

22:43.234 --> 22:44.567
Neil, my very good friend, Chris Finch.

22:44.634 --> 22:46.601
I know Chris. Nicks all my jokes.

22:46.667 --> 22:48.634
I do not nick 'em, I borrow 'em.

22:48.701 --> 22:50.801
Uh, has that uh, that Lisa moved up here?

22:50.868 --> 22:53.634
No, no, no. She left. She's looking for a job.

22:53.701 --> 22:55.100
-Well, if it's a blow job, I can help her. -(CACKLING)

22:55.167 --> 22:56.868
Not that desperate for money.

22:56.934 --> 23:01.033
-Tell her I'll take her up the dole office! -Dole orifice!

23:01.100 --> 23:03.934
-Rubbish. That's better. -Well, I've got a vacancy she can fill!

23:04.000 --> 23:06.334
His work. Don't try and...

23:07.734 --> 23:09.434
(CACKLING)

23:09.500 --> 23:11.734
-What are you like? -Another one.

23:11.801 --> 23:13.500
Once a year, kid.

23:13.567 --> 23:15.234
-Cheers, cheers, cheers to me, yet again. -Cheers.

23:34.767 --> 23:37.167
If you like Top Trumps, you should come to me.

23:37.234 --> 23:39.100
I've got about five different sets.

23:39.167 --> 23:41.167
Don't try to beat me on Monster Trucks, though. 'Cause you won't.

23:41.234 --> 23:43.167
My specialty.

23:43.234 --> 23:45.334
-Yeah, well, 's a game of chance, though, innit? So... -No. It's not.

23:45.400 --> 23:48.634
I would know what cards you got immediately just through which cards I got.

23:48.701 --> 23:52.167
I used to play it, just by myself with a dummy hand,

23:52.234 --> 23:54.634
for just testing out every different scenario,

23:54.701 --> 23:58.167
which cards beat which other cards, for hours sometimes.

23:58.234 --> 24:01.968
Three or four hours at a time, but put in the work, the rewards are obvious.

24:04.901 --> 24:07.334
So I know exactly what cards you've got in your hand

24:07.400 --> 24:10.434
from what cards I got, and I would know probability-wise

24:10.500 --> 24:14.868
exactly what feature to pick on my card to defeat statistically any card

24:14.934 --> 24:17.133
that you could have in your hand at that precise moment.

24:18.033 --> 24:19.968
You will never win.

24:21.033 --> 24:22.701
It'd still be fun, though.

24:25.567 --> 24:27.834
Do you know what I'm getting for... What they're paying me for this?

24:27.901 --> 24:29.300
-No. -Right.

24:29.367 --> 24:32.100
Fifteen minutes work, yeah? 300 quid.

24:32.167 --> 24:34.434
-1,200 quid an hour. -So... You do the math.

24:34.500 --> 24:38.234
-Yeah. It'd be 1,200 quid an hour. -So, that's the sort of...

24:38.300 --> 24:40.534
-Can I have a birthday kiss, please? -You certainly can!

24:42.033 --> 24:44.300
-All right. No tongues. -Oh.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.400
Oh, that's good, isn't it?

24:51.467 --> 24:53.901
Didn't ask me out of respect. Knows I'd say no.

24:54.100 --> 24:57.834
Didn't cross a boundary and that's... That's, you know... Good girl!

25:00.267 --> 25:02.500
-Go on. No. -(ALL LAUGHING)

25:04.634 --> 25:07.667
It is a good idea. I always do it from behind if I don't like their face.

25:07.734 --> 25:10.534
Cheeky bastard! You like my face, don't you, love?

25:10.601 --> 25:12.667
I love your face. I think you're beautiful.

25:12.734 --> 25:14.434
Yeah, well, you can still do me from behind, then.

25:14.500 --> 25:16.000
Ooh! I'll bear it in mind, then. (LAUGHS)

25:18.734 --> 25:20.500
I'll, uh, I'll do you from behind if you want.

25:20.567 --> 25:22.634
It's just a quick in-and-out, no strings attached.

25:23.801 --> 25:25.767
That's really sweet.

25:25.834 --> 25:27.701
Why don't you put that in an email to me?

25:28.567 --> 25:30.167
All right.

25:43.534 --> 25:46.000
# One kiss, two kiss, three kiss, four kiss

25:46.067 --> 25:48.901
-# Five kiss, seven kiss, eight kiss, more # -Yeah, thank you. Thank you.

25:58.767 --> 26:00.000
Birthday girl.

26:00.067 --> 26:02.167
-Hello. -Oh. Hello.

26:02.234 --> 26:03.834
-Oh, you all right? -Mmm-hmm.

26:03.901 --> 26:05.534
-Good. -Yeah?

26:05.601 --> 26:08.200
-Mmm. -I'm just gonna have a quick word.

26:08.267 --> 26:11.234
See, I know it's your birthday and you're... You're flirting with

26:11.300 --> 26:14.000
You're mucking around, you know.

26:14.067 --> 26:15.334
I know you wouldn't take any further...

26:15.400 --> 26:17.868
-Oh, I would! Yeah. -Wow.

26:17.934 --> 26:20.033
Why not? You know, it's all equal.

26:20.100 --> 26:22.133
-No, I'm just having a laugh, aren't I? -No, you are...

26:22.200 --> 26:24.267
It's just that I don't know what you're after.

26:24.334 --> 26:26.334
A man! Hung like a shire horse.

26:26.400 --> 26:28.200
-Oh. -(LAUGHS)

26:28.267 --> 26:30.901
Aren't they big magnificent animals?

26:32.400 --> 26:34.801
-You say what you mean, don't you? -Mmm-hmm.

26:34.868 --> 26:38.968
I'm just not sure you're going to find what you're after in here.

26:39.033 --> 26:41.067
See, I'd ask you, but you're a bit old, really.

26:41.133 --> 26:42.400
In my 30s. Give me a break.

26:42.467 --> 26:45.267
-Born in the '30s. -(BOTH LAUGHING)

26:45.334 --> 26:48.133
I'm 30-something. (STAMMERING) I'm 30s.

26:48.200 --> 26:49.834
Yeah, but you've let yourself go a bit, didn't you?

26:49.901 --> 26:51.701
-I've let myself go a bit? Look at yourself. -Yeah.

26:51.767 --> 26:54.133
You're an embarrassment, love. To be honest.

26:57.767 --> 27:00.567
-Bull rags? -What?

27:00.634 --> 27:03.601
-I thought you said bull rags. -No. No. Raw eggs.

27:03.667 --> 27:07.067
If you keep on eating raw eggs, it makes you randy,

27:07.133 --> 27:11.834
but at the same time, you know, it allows you to do as many reps as you want.

27:11.901 --> 27:16.000
-So, uh, how's the old car business? -All right.

27:16.067 --> 27:18.000
-Who's this? -That's The Corrs, innit?

27:18.067 --> 27:20.167
Oh, yeah. I like The Corrs. Done some good tunes.

27:20.234 --> 27:21.901
-Yeah. Didn't write that one, though. -(CLEARS THROAT)

27:21.968 --> 27:23.834
-No? Who's that? -No.

27:23.901 --> 27:25.133
-Don't you know? -No.

27:25.200 --> 27:27.067
Oh, not into pop music, I suppose?

27:27.133 --> 27:29.734
Well, I prefer R&B, really. So who wrote... So who wrote that?

27:29.801 --> 27:32.167
Fleetwood Mac. And I prefer their version as well.

27:32.234 --> 27:34.300
Well, uh, I know who I'd rather wake up with!

27:34.367 --> 27:36.033
Oh, sexist, Neil.

27:36.234 --> 27:38.367
They can play my instrument any day.

27:38.434 --> 27:41.400
Oh, bawdy. I don't think you pull women like the Corrs with that sort of attitude.

27:41.467 --> 27:42.634
-Yeah, 'cause you'd know. -(LAUGHING)

27:42.701 --> 27:44.167
Wow. Wow. I don't know, you're laughing?

27:44.234 --> 27:46.300
Because I'm a dark horse. So you don't, you don't...

27:46.367 --> 27:47.834
Yeah. Like you could get anyone like The Corrs.

27:47.901 --> 27:49.868
Yeah, well, I...

27:49.934 --> 27:51.434
Just 'cause I don't kiss and tell doesn't mean I don't get...

27:51.500 --> 27:54.434
You don't normally kiss, so you got nothing to tell.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.467
-He'd end up with the brother. -(ALL LAUGHING)

27:56.534 --> 27:58.067
No, I wouldn't. No, I wouldn't.

27:58.133 --> 27:59.534
I'd push the brother out the room,

27:59.601 --> 28:01.367
I'd get the other three and I'd bend them all over,

28:01.434 --> 28:04.367
and I'd do the drummer, the lead singer, and that one who plays violin.

28:14.767 --> 28:16.534
Oh, see?

28:16.601 --> 28:20.033
Your... Your fault. Putting filth in people's minds.

28:35.634 --> 28:39.234
# So what becomes of you, my love

28:41.634 --> 28:46.200
# When they have finally stripped you of

28:46.267 --> 28:48.634
# The handbags and the gladrags

28:48.701 --> 28:52.701
# That your granddad had to sweat so you could buy #

28:53.801 --> 28:55.000
(MOANING)

28:55.067 --> 28:57.200
(GRUNTING)

28:57.267 --> 28:59.234
-My knees hurt. -Nearly done.
