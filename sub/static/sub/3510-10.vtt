00:28.950 --> 00:30.231
Hmm.

00:31.477 --> 00:33.232
Don't get up yet. Stay in bed.

00:33.233 --> 00:34.358
Castle.

00:36.560 --> 00:38.516
Kate. Hi.

00:38.517 --> 00:39.722
Castle. What?

00:39.723 --> 00:40.676
Did you do this?

00:40.677 --> 00:41.656
What?

00:41.657 --> 00:43.379
Stop saying "what" and wake up.

00:43.380 --> 00:44.456
I don't...

00:47.505 --> 00:48.904
We're handcuffed.

00:49.383 --> 00:49.886
Kinky.

00:49.887 --> 00:50.905
Castle, it's not funny.

00:50.906 --> 00:52.536
I didn't say "funny."
I said "kinky."

00:52.537 --> 00:53.470
And I didn't cuff us.

00:53.471 --> 00:54.945
Well, y-you think I cuffed us?

00:54.946 --> 00:56.601
Well, they look
like police cuffs.

00:57.220 --> 00:58.937
Somebody else did this to us.

01:03.439 --> 01:04.632
Do you recognize this place?

01:04.632 --> 01:05.704
No.

01:06.253 --> 01:07.332
But if I were writing a book,

01:07.333 --> 01:10.467
this is where bad
things would happen.

01:10.468 --> 01:11.927
My watch is missing.

01:12.302 --> 01:14.580
Mine, too, and my wallet.

01:14.581 --> 01:15.725
So is my badge and my gun.

01:15.726 --> 01:18.306
And my phone.
I just renewed my contract.

01:18.307 --> 01:19.144
Would you stop joking?

01:19.145 --> 01:22.207
Hey, do I begrudge you
your coping mechanisms?

01:23.641 --> 01:25.450
What's the last thing
that you remember?

01:25.451 --> 01:26.639
I...

01:28.740 --> 01:30.103
It's kind of a blur.

01:30.223 --> 01:32.263
Yeah, me, too.

01:32.303 --> 01:33.436
I think we were drugged.

01:33.437 --> 01:35.662
Yeah, I think so, too,
and not the good kind.

01:36.124 --> 01:37.217
Okay.

01:37.676 --> 01:38.867
Lift my top.

01:40.309 --> 01:42.678
I think you might still be
under the influence, but okay.

01:42.679 --> 01:44.151
Castle, not like that.
Just check my back.

01:44.152 --> 01:45.620
There's something that hurts.

01:47.546 --> 01:48.851
There's a needle mark.

01:49.317 --> 01:50.568
We were drugged.

01:51.031 --> 01:53.008
It looks like the work of
a pygmy with a blowgun.

01:53.009 --> 01:54.257
Okay, you can put my shirt down.

01:54.258 --> 01:55.740
- Yeah, sorry.
- Thanks.

01:55.858 --> 01:58.341
All right, Castle, I want
you to think very hard.

01:58.342 --> 02:01.119
What's the last thing that you
remember from this morning?

02:01.711 --> 02:02.867
I was with you.

02:03.008 --> 02:05.405
We were, uh, someplace seedy--

02:05.492 --> 02:07.147
a hotel that rents
rooms by the hour.

02:07.148 --> 02:08.309
Would you just knock it off?

02:08.310 --> 02:09.842
It's where we were.

02:09.844 --> 02:12.309
You called me and you asked
me to meet you there.

02:12.310 --> 02:13.443
Oh, I did. Yes.

02:13.464 --> 02:15.904
And then I took you
up to the room

02:15.905 --> 02:18.016
and then we...

02:19.679 --> 02:21.017
And then we...

02:23.423 --> 02:26.193
Dead body.
We went to go and see a dead body.

02:26.524 --> 02:27.668
Right.

02:28.162 --> 02:29.319
A dead body.

02:32.384 --> 02:34.381
You know what I love
about working with you?

02:34.517 --> 02:36.405
You always take me to the
most charming places.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.894
Well, I'm a simple girl, Castle.
I go where the bodies are.

02:38.895 --> 02:40.311
Besides, for a mystery novelist,

02:40.312 --> 02:42.197
aren't seedy motels
kind of a standard?

02:42.198 --> 02:43.706
Ah, yes. Matter of fact,

02:43.707 --> 02:46.708
they're a veritable advent
calendar of salaciousness.

02:46.709 --> 02:48.872
Behind every door,
a delightful tale

02:48.873 --> 02:50.687
of desperation, depravity--

02:50.688 --> 02:51.936
Or death.

02:52.004 --> 02:53.508
You know, you need to stop
being a control freak.

02:53.509 --> 02:54.517
I'm not--what do you
mean, a control freak?

02:54.541 --> 02:57.189
- You are being a control freak.
- I've never been a control freak.

02:58.572 --> 03:00.342
Sorry. Are we interrupting?

03:00.343 --> 03:03.635
No. Victim's a white
male, late 30s.

03:04.064 --> 03:06.067
Housekeeping found him when
they came to clean the room.

03:06.068 --> 03:06.985
Cause of death?

03:06.986 --> 03:08.252
Not entirely sure yet.

03:08.253 --> 03:10.085
But there are
indications of asphyxia

03:10.086 --> 03:12.051
with some cyanosis
around the face.

03:12.052 --> 03:13.282
So he was suffocated?

03:13.283 --> 03:15.917
Maybe. Then again, there's this.

03:15.918 --> 03:16.735
Needle mark.

03:16.736 --> 03:19.313
So he could've just OD'd,
passed out face first,

03:19.314 --> 03:21.504
- and suffocated.
- Oh, no. It's definitely murder.

03:21.505 --> 03:22.337
How can you tell?

03:22.338 --> 03:24.776
Someone torched his fingers.

03:24.948 --> 03:26.276
Burned off his prints.

03:26.277 --> 03:28.323
They wanted to erase
his identity.

03:28.324 --> 03:30.070
And they did a pretty
good job, too.

03:30.071 --> 03:30.945
His wallet's missing,

03:30.946 --> 03:32.272
and we've been through the
room a couple of times.

03:32.273 --> 03:33.974
There's nothing here to
tell us who this guy is.

03:33.975 --> 03:35.322
Did he pay for the room in cash?

03:35.323 --> 03:38.564
Yeah, and the clerk said that
he registered as Jack Sparrow.

03:38.565 --> 03:41.518
Oh, there's a possibility
that's his real name.

03:41.565 --> 03:42.675
Sure it is.

03:45.704 --> 03:47.947
We're running it just in case.

03:48.233 --> 03:48.733
The clerk also said

03:48.734 --> 03:50.695
he appeared nervous
when he checked in.

03:50.696 --> 03:52.576
He, uh, kept looking behind him.

03:52.577 --> 03:54.517
- Did he have any visitors?
- He couldn't say,

03:54.518 --> 03:55.917
but this isn't the
most secure building.

03:55.918 --> 03:57.591
I saw a camera in the lobby.

03:57.592 --> 03:59.128
- It's a dummy.
- It's not the only one.

03:59.129 --> 04:01.961
It's used to scare
away drug dealers.

04:03.693 --> 04:05.373
Okay, um...

04:05.597 --> 04:07.322
you don't go to the trouble
of trying to erase

04:07.323 --> 04:08.723
someone's identity

04:08.724 --> 04:10.425
unless you have a
very good reason to.

04:10.426 --> 04:11.859
Lanie, what are the
chances of us recovering

04:11.860 --> 04:13.151
some of the prints?

04:13.748 --> 04:15.425
Depends on how bad
the burns are.

04:15.426 --> 04:16.810
L-let me get him
back to the morgue.

04:16.810 --> 04:18.228
Okay, in the meantime,
let's get Ryan

04:18.230 --> 04:19.786
to run his photos
through missing persons

04:19.786 --> 04:22.518
and... see if anything pops.

04:22.607 --> 04:23.825
You got it.

04:29.424 --> 04:30.777
John Doe in a seedy motel

04:30.778 --> 04:32.863
with his fingerprints
burned off.

04:34.322 --> 04:35.920
How did we get from there

04:35.921 --> 04:37.791
- to here?
- Whoa.

04:37.792 --> 04:39.217
Whoa, easy, easy there.

04:39.218 --> 04:40.323
Hate to state the obvious,

04:40.324 --> 04:41.553
but we're kind of
joined at the hip here.

04:41.554 --> 04:43.301
Okay, let's just get up.
Come on.

04:43.302 --> 04:45.462
Are you always like
this in the morning?

04:45.556 --> 04:47.738
Oh, this is...

04:48.543 --> 04:50.202
- this is awkward.
- Yeah.

04:50.827 --> 04:52.970
They couldn't just handcuff
us "Midnight Run" style?

04:52.971 --> 04:55.355
Wait a minute. Ryan did run our
guy through missing persons,

04:55.356 --> 04:57.519
and there wasn't a match.
Then what?

04:58.956 --> 05:00.046
Then...

05:00.867 --> 05:02.338
Ryan asked me...

05:04.785 --> 05:07.299
if he spent Thanksgiving
at his family's house,

05:07.300 --> 05:09.012
did that mean he had
to spend Christmas

05:09.013 --> 05:10.098
at Jenny's family's house?

05:10.099 --> 05:12.305
Castle, I'm talking
about our case.

05:12.364 --> 05:13.753
If you want me to reconstruct
it, I have to do it in order.

05:13.754 --> 05:15.296
Okay, fine. Um...

05:15.806 --> 05:17.846
burnt fingerprints, suffocated,

05:17.847 --> 05:19.984
uh... needle marks.

05:19.985 --> 05:22.536
The morgue.
We went to the morgue.

05:23.329 --> 05:25.502
I told you, it's none
of your business.

05:25.503 --> 05:26.920
Of course it's none
of my business,

05:26.921 --> 05:28.382
that's why I want to know.

05:28.383 --> 05:29.146
Know what?

05:29.147 --> 05:30.868
What she and Esposito
were fighting about.

05:30.869 --> 05:32.143
It's none of your business.

05:32.144 --> 05:33.317
That's the point.

05:33.700 --> 05:34.492
Where are we?

05:34.493 --> 05:35.638
No ID yet,

05:35.639 --> 05:37.076
but his hands have calluses,

05:37.077 --> 05:40.252
so most likely, he had a job
that required physical labor.

05:40.253 --> 05:41.613
What about fingerprints?

05:41.614 --> 05:43.335
Outer skin's too damaged.

05:44.352 --> 05:48.330
But... I may be able
to macerate the skin,

05:48.389 --> 05:51.360
pull some from the underside
of the epidural layer.

05:51.361 --> 05:52.303
You can do that?

05:52.304 --> 05:54.539
Yes, in some cases.

05:54.651 --> 05:55.899
But it's gonna take
a couple of days.

05:55.900 --> 05:58.069
In the meantime,
I did find this.

05:58.070 --> 06:00.517
It was tucked in the fold
of his pants pocket.

06:00.518 --> 06:02.882
It would've been real easy
for our killer to miss.

06:02.883 --> 06:07.744
"147 West 97th Street,
4:00 P.M."

06:08.194 --> 06:10.062
It's the address of
the Cambury Cafe,

06:10.063 --> 06:11.397
half block off Broadway.

06:11.398 --> 06:13.269
4:00 P.M. he was meeting someone.

06:13.270 --> 06:14.116
Or met someone.

06:14.117 --> 06:16.002
Okay, you and Esposito
take this up there and see

06:16.003 --> 06:17.892
if anyone remembers
seeing our victim.

06:17.893 --> 06:19.722
Maybe that'll help us ID him.

06:19.723 --> 06:20.357
On it.

06:20.358 --> 06:22.106
What was so special
about our victim

06:22.107 --> 06:24.689
that our killer wanted
to erase his identity?

06:25.023 --> 06:26.144
Don't say spy.

06:27.827 --> 06:29.086
Or mob hit.

06:29.390 --> 06:30.818
Mob hit of a spy?

06:31.703 --> 06:33.036
Crazy theories
aren't gonna help,

06:33.037 --> 06:35.499
not until we figure
out who this guy is.

06:38.254 --> 06:39.365
Beckett?

06:39.425 --> 06:40.517
What?

06:40.832 --> 06:42.384
This is a postal bar code.

06:42.385 --> 06:44.496
Our victim wrote this note
on the back of an envelope.

06:44.497 --> 06:45.561
A postal bar code?

06:45.562 --> 06:46.953
Yeah, those little hash marks

06:46.954 --> 06:48.920
you see on mailing
labels and envelopes.

06:48.921 --> 06:52.139
It's a way of exactly
identifying an address.

06:52.140 --> 06:54.467
But in a machine-readable way.

06:54.482 --> 06:55.794
We get that decoded,

06:55.795 --> 06:57.807
we'll be able to tell exactly
where our victim was

06:57.808 --> 06:59.071
when he wrote that note.

06:59.416 --> 07:00.992
Okay, then we called
the post office,

07:00.993 --> 07:02.583
and they gave us the address.

07:04.280 --> 07:05.601
The house in Queens.

07:07.029 --> 07:08.958
So do you know what Lanie and
Esposito were fighting about?

07:08.959 --> 07:10.157
Everything.

07:10.724 --> 07:11.888
They both want to be together,

07:11.889 --> 07:14.189
but neither of them
wants to admit to it.

07:14.190 --> 07:16.395
Ugh. Why do people do
that to themselves?

07:16.396 --> 07:18.056
Maybe they just don't see it.

07:18.239 --> 07:20.129
How could they not?
It's so obvious.

07:20.711 --> 07:21.887
This is the place?

07:22.529 --> 07:24.017
Matches the address.

07:24.276 --> 07:25.868
Doesn't look like
anybody's home.

07:33.133 --> 07:34.251
Hello?

07:35.009 --> 07:37.067
NYPD. Anybody here?

07:44.349 --> 07:45.524
Hello?

07:50.262 --> 07:51.536
Anybody here?

08:11.291 --> 08:13.167
Bill and Nora Ranford.

08:14.046 --> 08:15.934
Maybe Bill is our John Doe.

08:18.613 --> 08:20.757
NYPD. Identify yourself.

08:21.169 --> 08:22.499
Help me.

08:40.412 --> 08:41.293
Ma'am.

08:41.294 --> 08:42.683
Ma'am, are you okay?

09:04.690 --> 09:06.814
And an old woman in a cage.

09:06.815 --> 09:08.859
Yeah, that's the last
thing I remember.

09:11.177 --> 09:12.362
Me, too.

09:16.302 --> 09:17.769
What the hell is going on?

09:19.231 --> 09:24.277
Sync by YYeTs, corrections by Alex1969
www.addic7ed.com

09:27.685 --> 09:30.692
It's just, I always spend
Christmas with my family.

09:30.693 --> 09:32.927
Right. Well, you were the one

09:32.928 --> 09:34.231
who decided to get hitched, bro.

09:34.232 --> 09:37.283
Yeah, but I didn't think that
meant driving down to Florida

09:37.284 --> 09:38.977
to spend the holidays
with her grandmother.

09:38.978 --> 09:41.640
Driving? You're not flying?

09:41.641 --> 09:43.268
During the holidays?
Are you kidding me?

09:43.413 --> 09:44.971
Besides, Jenny thinks
that, a-a road trip

09:44.972 --> 09:47.082
will give us some
quality time together.

09:47.507 --> 09:49.991
That is no road trip, brother.

09:50.025 --> 09:51.118
That...

09:51.634 --> 09:53.089
is a relationship test.

09:54.017 --> 09:55.547
A relationship test?

09:56.220 --> 09:57.371
We're getting
married in a month.

09:57.372 --> 09:59.307
Well, we'll see what
happens after the test.

09:59.308 --> 10:01.151
It's the pre-wedding
road trip test.

10:01.152 --> 10:03.194
Locked together for hours,

10:03.195 --> 10:05.265
that way she can confront you
with any lingering doubts

10:05.266 --> 10:07.176
she may have about
your future together.

10:07.177 --> 10:10.099
And you...
will have nowhere to hide.

10:10.160 --> 10:11.247
Hey.

10:11.379 --> 10:12.781
Have either of you seen Beckett?

10:12.782 --> 10:14.536
She's probably following
up on a lead.

10:15.996 --> 10:16.869
Don't think that I don't know

10:16.870 --> 10:18.938
that you guys cover
for each other.

10:20.028 --> 10:21.575
Mm. What's that?

10:21.822 --> 10:23.475
Any progress on our John Doe?

10:23.476 --> 10:26.611
Yeah. Turned out, he did show up
at the Cambury Cafe yesterday,

10:26.612 --> 10:28.024
and he wasn't alone.

10:28.025 --> 10:29.504
Waitress recognized
him immediately,

10:29.505 --> 10:30.833
said he sat in the corner booth,

10:30.834 --> 10:32.944
met with a guy--
long hair, goatee--

10:32.945 --> 10:34.256
said our vic looked nervous.

10:34.257 --> 10:36.373
We have the waitress
working with an artist

10:36.374 --> 10:39.106
to see if we can come up with
a sketch of the goateed man

10:39.107 --> 10:40.231
to use on a canvass.

10:40.232 --> 10:42.237
All right. Keep me apprised.

10:44.576 --> 10:46.994
Come on, Jenny loves me.
She wouldn't test me like that.

10:46.995 --> 10:48.094
Right.

10:48.109 --> 10:51.484
Just watch out if she wants
to take you canoeing.

10:51.666 --> 10:52.815
Okay?

10:53.686 --> 10:56.567
Canoeing? C-canoeing is a test?

10:56.577 --> 10:59.277
It's all about power, direction,

10:59.545 --> 11:00.790
like a marriage.

11:00.899 --> 11:02.735
If the canoe goes straight,

11:02.736 --> 11:04.182
it shows her that
you can compromise,

11:04.183 --> 11:06.676
work together, find a rhythm,

11:06.677 --> 11:08.343
move forward in the
same direction.

11:08.344 --> 11:11.033
But if it's going
around in circles,

11:11.576 --> 11:13.122
so is your relationship.

11:14.836 --> 11:16.143
Castle, would you
just work with me?

11:16.144 --> 11:17.723
How about you work with me?

11:17.724 --> 11:19.571
How come you always
have to lead?

11:20.081 --> 11:22.232
How come you always have
to step on my toes?

11:22.233 --> 11:25.074
Since when do I--
okay, you know what?

11:25.138 --> 11:26.308
Tell me this--

11:26.676 --> 11:28.669
why do you always
have to be first?

11:28.965 --> 11:30.828
First out of the elevator,

11:30.829 --> 11:31.803
first through the door.

11:31.804 --> 11:34.610
Um, I am a cop.
I'm the one with a gun.

11:34.611 --> 11:37.606
Being first through
the door is my job.

11:38.281 --> 11:39.400
In the elevator?

11:39.401 --> 11:40.881
Look, how about this?

11:40.985 --> 11:43.389
Would it kill ya to let
someone open the door for you

11:43.390 --> 11:44.346
once in a while?

11:44.347 --> 11:46.398
You do realize, if somebody
opens the door for me,

11:46.399 --> 11:48.900
then I will be going through
it first anyway, right?

11:48.901 --> 11:49.953
Oh, yeah, that's right.
I forgot.

11:49.954 --> 11:51.417
You have to be the
smartest, too.

11:51.418 --> 11:52.710
Everything's a
competition with you.

11:52.711 --> 11:53.577
That is so not true.

11:53.578 --> 11:55.212
Are you always like
this in the mornings?

11:55.213 --> 11:56.040
You know, I'd argue with you,

11:56.041 --> 11:57.560
but then I'd have
to let you win.

11:57.742 --> 11:59.784
Okay, fine.
Go ahead. You lead.

12:00.435 --> 12:01.546
Thank you.

12:04.418 --> 12:05.874
Where did you want to go?

12:06.212 --> 12:08.325
I think that there's a
light switch over there.

12:08.326 --> 12:10.055
Or do you want to
stay in the dark?

12:16.009 --> 12:18.458
Ooh.
I liked it better in the dark.

12:18.459 --> 12:20.403
This door is steel.
There's no way we're getting through here.

12:20.404 --> 12:22.503
These walls are cinder block.

12:22.636 --> 12:23.741
Whoa.

12:25.270 --> 12:27.698
What do you suppose is
in that big freezer?

12:31.596 --> 12:33.207
You think it's the old woman?

12:33.724 --> 12:35.211
I mean, what if we're
in some psycho's lair

12:35.212 --> 12:37.011
and we have to kill each
other, like in "Saw"?

12:37.012 --> 12:38.873
Castle, stop speculating.
It's not helping.

12:38.874 --> 12:41.386
Oh, come on.
An old lady in a cage,

12:41.387 --> 12:43.146
us cuffed together
in this creepy room.

12:43.147 --> 12:44.091
What am I supposed to think?

12:44.092 --> 12:45.023
You're supposed to
think that we need

12:45.024 --> 12:47.692
to get the hell outta here
before someone comes back.

12:47.693 --> 12:48.931
How long do you
think we were out?

12:48.932 --> 12:49.989
Couple of hours.

12:49.990 --> 12:50.986
How can you tell?

12:50.987 --> 12:52.168
'Cause I'm hungry.

12:52.275 --> 12:53.491
Oh.

12:54.231 --> 12:55.687
I got some beef jerky.

12:57.158 --> 12:58.230
What?

12:58.502 --> 12:59.686
Hold my hand.

13:01.987 --> 13:03.915
So the cuffs don't cut into us.

13:03.986 --> 13:05.573
We could just try
to get 'em off.

13:05.574 --> 13:06.847
You got a bobby pin?

13:06.848 --> 13:09.014
What is this, the 1940s?

13:09.015 --> 13:10.032
These are my police cuffs.

13:10.033 --> 13:12.551
You're not gonna open
them with a bobby pin.

13:13.295 --> 13:14.442
Face it.

13:14.731 --> 13:15.937
We're stuck.

13:18.725 --> 13:20.417
Think anyone knows
we're missing?

13:20.418 --> 13:22.784
Martha and Alexis will notice
if you don't go home, right?

13:23.475 --> 13:24.734
Actually, my mother's
taking Alexis

13:24.735 --> 13:26.633
on a tour of colleges
this weekend.

13:26.892 --> 13:27.660
Esposito and Ryan--

13:27.661 --> 13:30.206
Yeah, they'll probably notice,
but it doesn't mean they'll...

13:31.200 --> 13:32.481
find us here.

13:34.740 --> 13:35.848
What is that?

13:38.461 --> 13:39.189
It's a hatch.

13:39.190 --> 13:41.028
If we can get up there, we
might be able to get out.

13:41.029 --> 13:42.801
Yeah, well, it's too high.

13:42.831 --> 13:44.654
Not if we climb on top of that.

13:47.512 --> 13:48.739
That was Lanie.

13:48.787 --> 13:51.394
Preliminary autopsy report
shows that our victim

13:51.395 --> 13:52.955
was in fact smothered.

13:52.956 --> 13:55.144
Guy his size, you'd think he'd
put up more of a struggle.

13:55.145 --> 13:57.053
He couldn't.
Tox report showed that

13:57.054 --> 13:58.826
his system was flooded
with so much sedative

13:58.827 --> 14:00.714
that it could put
down an elephant.

14:01.022 --> 14:02.044
Where are we with that sketch?

14:02.045 --> 14:04.913
Well, I got unis looking
through mug books

14:04.914 --> 14:07.101
and I sent a team
uptown to canvass.

14:09.975 --> 14:11.129
Still not back, huh?

14:11.130 --> 14:12.282
No.

14:12.670 --> 14:13.906
It's been hours.

14:14.191 --> 14:16.285
Every time I call, it goes
straight to voice mail.

14:16.286 --> 14:17.879
You think they're really
running down a lead?

14:17.880 --> 14:18.918
What lead?

14:18.919 --> 14:20.993
There was nothing new on the
board when we came back.

14:22.924 --> 14:24.553
You think you can
hit up dispatch,

14:24.857 --> 14:26.481
see if they'll run a
trace on the transponder

14:26.482 --> 14:27.741
in Beckett's unit?

14:28.179 --> 14:29.695
I want to know where they are.

14:38.409 --> 14:39.644
Ohh! I can't get a
good angle on it.

14:39.645 --> 14:41.297
Yeah. Try this.

14:42.026 --> 14:43.045
Ready?

14:43.046 --> 14:44.095
You better not be
enjoying this, Castle.

14:44.096 --> 14:45.569
I'll let you know in a minute.

14:45.948 --> 14:48.041
One, two, three.

14:48.042 --> 14:49.186
Push.

14:53.242 --> 14:54.897
Oh. Okay.

14:56.507 --> 14:58.046
Whatever's in here is a
hell of a lot heavier

14:58.047 --> 14:59.214
than a little old lady.

14:59.215 --> 15:01.638
It's like...
it's filled with rocks.

15:03.661 --> 15:05.025
What if we emptied it?

15:05.026 --> 15:06.150
That's a great idea, Castle,

15:06.151 --> 15:09.071
except it's locked, and I'm
fresh out of bolt cutters.

15:09.072 --> 15:11.045
Yeah, but it's a combo lock.

15:11.268 --> 15:11.895
So?

15:11.896 --> 15:14.523
So when I was writing
"Storm Rising,"

15:14.640 --> 15:17.134
I studied with one of the best
safe crackers in the biz.

15:17.135 --> 15:21.177
I can open this.
I just don't know if we want to.

15:23.513 --> 15:24.838
Let's get crackin', Castle,

15:24.839 --> 15:26.525
before our captors get back.

15:30.901 --> 15:33.778
Transponder says her
unit's right over here.

15:44.591 --> 15:46.393
That's definitely Beckett's car.

15:52.923 --> 15:54.358
Looks like it's been dumped.

15:54.359 --> 15:56.049
Yeah, call it in.

16:04.254 --> 16:07.166
Time stamp puts this
at five hours ago.

16:07.172 --> 16:08.890
So that's Beckett's car.

16:10.438 --> 16:12.646
But that's not
Castle or Beckett.

16:12.647 --> 16:14.484
And he's not alone.
Someone picked him up.

16:14.485 --> 16:15.613
Do we know who they are?

16:15.614 --> 16:16.551
No clue.

16:16.552 --> 16:17.937
Can we get a plate number?

16:20.208 --> 16:21.192
Too far away.

16:21.193 --> 16:23.226
I also ran Beckett
and Castle's cells.

16:23.227 --> 16:24.535
They're both off grid.

16:24.536 --> 16:26.574
What the hell did
Castle get her into?

16:26.575 --> 16:28.268
I want CSU on that car

16:28.269 --> 16:31.198
with a fine-tooth comb for
any possible trace evidence.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.147
They were working the
John Doe with you.

16:33.148 --> 16:34.972
Where could they have gone?

16:34.973 --> 16:36.698
Been over it a dozen times.
We still don't know.

16:36.699 --> 16:39.603
And still no hits on our
long-haired man from the cafe.

16:39.686 --> 16:41.938
Do whatever it takes to get an ID
on that victim

16:41.939 --> 16:44.035
and find out what in
the hell he was into.

16:44.782 --> 16:46.440
If Beckett and Castle
are still out there,

16:46.441 --> 16:48.205
then they're running
out of time.

17:00.371 --> 17:01.489
Oh, for God sake, Castle.

17:01.490 --> 17:03.441
How much longer are you
gonna keep doing this?

17:03.442 --> 17:04.837
Oh, I almost had it.

17:04.838 --> 17:06.853
Yeah. Like you had it
the last hundred times.

17:06.854 --> 17:08.791
Oh, ye of little faith.

17:09.064 --> 17:11.261
You know, you would make a
terrible conjoined twin.

17:11.339 --> 17:12.752
Can I have my hand back?

17:16.208 --> 17:18.646
So you got a story to
explain all of this--

17:18.967 --> 17:20.532
the old woman in the cage,

17:20.904 --> 17:22.861
John Doe with his
identity removed,

17:22.862 --> 17:24.989
us handcuffed but still alive?

17:24.990 --> 17:26.939
Yeah, I don't think that's
a story you want to hear.

17:26.940 --> 17:28.026
Why not?

17:28.378 --> 17:29.792
With those elements,

17:29.814 --> 17:31.540
I can't think of a
version that ends well,

17:31.541 --> 17:33.097
not even a Disney version.

17:34.334 --> 17:35.738
Yeah, I was afraid of that.

17:38.006 --> 17:41.369
The good news is, we've
been gone long enough,

17:41.370 --> 17:43.426
they've started to
look for us by now.

17:47.152 --> 17:48.850
Hundred and first
time's the charm?

17:51.660 --> 17:52.532
Come on, Lanie. There's gotta be

17:52.533 --> 17:54.741
something else about this
guy from this autopsy.

17:54.742 --> 17:56.813
He was in the beginning
stages of heart disease.

17:56.814 --> 17:58.849
He had a degenerative
hip condition,

17:58.850 --> 18:02.607
and mild scoliosis, probably
from sitting too much,

18:02.608 --> 18:04.636
and the last thing he had to eat

18:04.637 --> 18:06.169
was a pastrami sandwich--

18:06.170 --> 18:08.483
none of which will get you an ID.

18:08.484 --> 18:10.311
His hands were callused,
suggesting physical labor,

18:10.312 --> 18:12.158
and yet--and yet, he spent
too much time sitting?

18:12.159 --> 18:14.494
Maybe he drove a forklift.
I don't know.

18:14.495 --> 18:16.748
Come on.
We need something concrete, now.

18:16.749 --> 18:18.096
Then I can't help you.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.207
Lanie, they're out there.

18:19.208 --> 18:20.826
God knows where or what
kind of trouble they're in.

18:20.827 --> 18:23.817
You don't think I want to help?
They're my friends, too.

18:28.578 --> 18:30.871
So Beckett said,

18:30.929 --> 18:33.142
with enough time, you might
be able to recover prints.

18:33.143 --> 18:34.530
Yeah, in a couple of days. Why?

18:34.531 --> 18:36.092
What happens if you do it now?

18:36.211 --> 18:38.320
I could damage the print
beyond recognition.

18:38.321 --> 18:41.762
"Could." So it's possible
that it might not, right?

18:43.736 --> 18:45.229
We gotta do something.

19:01.770 --> 19:02.359
I did it.

19:02.360 --> 19:04.474
- You did it!
- Ha ha!

19:09.397 --> 19:10.272
How bad can it be?

19:10.273 --> 19:12.845
I mean, we've seen dead
bodies before, right?

19:13.487 --> 19:14.604
Right.

19:20.468 --> 19:21.741
It's not a body.

19:22.211 --> 19:23.381
No.

19:23.867 --> 19:25.074
It's worse.

19:36.056 --> 19:39.003
Manacles and bloody
instruments of torture.

19:39.166 --> 19:41.878
Yeah, looks like your crazed,
sadistic, psycho killer theory

19:41.879 --> 19:43.366
might not be far off, Castle.

19:43.367 --> 19:45.305
Well, I don't know whether
to be smug or horrified.

19:45.306 --> 19:46.171
I vote for motivated.

19:46.172 --> 19:48.038
Right you are.
Let's get the hell outta here.

19:56.248 --> 19:57.014
Javi.

19:57.015 --> 19:58.163
What?

19:58.567 --> 20:01.698
I can feel your impatience
all over my backside,

20:01.929 --> 20:04.746
and rushing me is
never a good idea.

20:05.325 --> 20:06.652
You're talking about
that print, right?

20:12.447 --> 20:13.156
Damn it.

20:13.268 --> 20:14.679
- What?
- It tore.

20:15.336 --> 20:17.174
I guess the skin wasn't
softened enough.

20:17.565 --> 20:18.298
It's ruined.

20:18.690 --> 20:19.705
Is any of it usable?

20:19.965 --> 20:22.580
I might be able to salvage
some from the middle. Why?

20:23.610 --> 20:24.600
So what we did...

20:24.768 --> 20:26.523
was, we were able to
join the partials

20:26.524 --> 20:27.730
from that scrap of paper

20:27.731 --> 20:30.033
with the, uh, print pieces

20:30.254 --> 20:31.302
that Lanie recovered.

20:34.156 --> 20:35.374
Our victim is Hank Spooner.

20:35.447 --> 20:37.080
An independent trucker
out of San Antonio.

20:37.279 --> 20:38.661
Owns and operates his own rig.

20:38.826 --> 20:40.089
What was he doing in New York?

20:40.090 --> 20:42.405
Well, according to his folks,
he got a contract last week

20:42.406 --> 20:44.376
to pick up a load
from Del Rio, Texas,

20:44.377 --> 20:45.281
and bring it to Queens.

20:45.799 --> 20:47.337
Last they heard from
him was two days ago.

20:50.711 --> 20:51.456
What was the cargo?

20:51.691 --> 20:54.288
Well, all Spooner told 'em was
he got a last-minute call

20:54.531 --> 20:57.241
from a special client who
was paying him big money.

20:57.286 --> 20:57.900
His folks also said,

20:57.901 --> 20:59.858
it's unusual for him to
be staying in a motel.

20:59.988 --> 21:02.263
Apparently, Spooner never
stayed in the city.

21:02.264 --> 21:03.454
He thought it was
safer and cheaper

21:03.455 --> 21:04.377
to stay in his truck.

21:04.508 --> 21:05.774
We need to find that vehicle.

21:06.416 --> 21:08.661
Get an APB out
to all the major truck stops.

21:08.685 --> 21:10.029
If we're lucky, it may tell us

21:10.030 --> 21:11.809
why someone wanted
Hank Spooner dead.

21:11.967 --> 21:13.777
I think maybe I can
help answer that.

21:16.219 --> 21:17.159
You looking for me?

21:18.960 --> 21:21.204
Chuck Martinez, DEA.

21:23.154 --> 21:24.386
How did you know we
were looking for you,

21:24.387 --> 21:25.317
agent Martinez?

21:26.131 --> 21:27.612
We had Spooner's files tagged.

21:28.969 --> 21:30.641
He's a person of interest,
so I got notified

21:30.675 --> 21:31.907
when you ran his prints.

21:32.620 --> 21:33.981
Why did you meet
with him yesterday?

21:37.880 --> 21:39.587
Your man's dead, agent Martinez,

21:39.588 --> 21:41.085
and two of my folks are missing.

21:41.406 --> 21:42.915
We don't have time for
jurisdictional games,

21:42.916 --> 21:45.735
so I'll ask you again, what's
your interest in Spooner?

21:47.446 --> 21:48.150
All right.

21:50.824 --> 21:52.282
About a half a dozen
times a year,

21:52.391 --> 21:55.705
Spooner takes a contract
from Texas to New York,

21:55.722 --> 21:57.901
but he always makes a
pick up in Del Rio.

21:57.902 --> 21:59.152
It's a little border town.

21:59.453 --> 22:01.345
You think he's smuggling
drugs from Mexico?

22:01.878 --> 22:03.496
The cartels are really
active in these towns.

22:03.497 --> 22:04.607
They're extremely brutal.

22:04.608 --> 22:05.844
And if you knew
Spooner was involved,

22:05.845 --> 22:06.944
why didn't you arrest him?

22:06.945 --> 22:08.427
All the signs were there, okay?

22:08.451 --> 22:10.511
But all we had him on was
suspicious activity,

22:10.512 --> 22:11.977
and we don't want
the errand boy.

22:11.978 --> 22:13.434
We want the people he works for.

22:13.530 --> 22:15.062
How'd you end up at that cafe?

22:15.709 --> 22:16.851
We needed some leverage.

22:17.480 --> 22:18.762
So we set up a sting,

22:18.963 --> 22:21.842
posing as runners looking to
hire him to move some product,

22:21.843 --> 22:23.413
only Spooner made my guy.

22:24.024 --> 22:26.872
Now instead of running,
Spooner--he wanted to meet.

22:27.591 --> 22:28.673
Okay? And he was scared.

22:29.011 --> 22:31.456
He wanted out, and he was afraid
of what they would do to him

22:31.457 --> 22:32.538
if he walked away.

22:32.881 --> 22:34.588
So he agreed to
tell us everything

22:34.589 --> 22:36.045
if I guaranteed him safety,

22:36.046 --> 22:38.316
and I took that to my
bosses, they agreed.

22:38.362 --> 22:39.906
But by then, he
was already dead.

22:40.028 --> 22:40.731
Right.

22:42.914 --> 22:43.787
Excuse me.

22:48.478 --> 22:50.709
So where were your colleagues
when they went missing?

22:51.560 --> 22:52.295
We don't know.

22:52.429 --> 22:53.718
We just know they
were on the case.

22:53.883 --> 22:56.181
Did Spooner say anything to you
about the New York operation?

22:56.328 --> 22:57.478
All he said was,

22:58.169 --> 22:59.563
"It's not at all
what you think."

23:01.933 --> 23:03.082
Troopers found a semi.

23:03.443 --> 23:05.092
Truck stop north of the city.

23:05.774 --> 23:06.713
Let's go, boys.

23:09.199 --> 23:10.448
According to truck stop records,

23:10.449 --> 23:12.114
the rig's been parked
here for three days.

23:12.326 --> 23:13.828
No one's seen the
driver for two.

23:14.243 --> 23:15.635
You're gonna want to
take a look inside.

23:28.986 --> 23:29.514
That's hair.

23:30.165 --> 23:31.258
These could be air holes.

23:31.394 --> 23:32.827
Hey, over here.

23:39.204 --> 23:40.262
Still too high.

23:41.196 --> 23:43.313
Not if I climb on
your shoulders.

23:44.995 --> 23:46.125
What? We've done it before.

23:46.192 --> 23:47.954
Yeah, you say that
like it was pleasant,

23:47.955 --> 23:49.234
and we weren't handcuffed.

23:49.544 --> 23:50.791
Who's got no faith now?

23:51.006 --> 23:52.960
Come on, Castle. We have no idea
when they're coming back

23:52.961 --> 23:54.532
or even if they're
coming back at all.

23:56.039 --> 23:57.653
Last time, you were
wearing sneakers.

23:57.954 --> 23:58.593
Fine.

24:02.850 --> 24:03.777
I think I'm gonna
need your help.

24:04.430 --> 24:06.526
"Lift up my shirt,
pull off my boots."

24:06.923 --> 24:08.229
You know, under
normal circumstances,

24:08.230 --> 24:09.519
I would like where
this was heading.

24:09.544 --> 24:11.807
You can fantasize later, after
we get out of the room.

24:11.958 --> 24:14.343
Just so you know, not as much
fun if I have your permission.

24:14.582 --> 24:16.022
How do you run in these things?

24:16.997 --> 24:18.106
Shut up and pull.

24:20.072 --> 24:23.198
Agent Martinez, are you sure
these guys were smuggling drugs?

24:23.516 --> 24:25.146
You know, if I had
answers, I'd share.

24:25.307 --> 24:27.114
- Captain Gates.
- What'd you find?

24:27.522 --> 24:29.243
- Waybills.
- Spooner delivered

24:29.244 --> 24:31.595
to a furniture store in lower
Manhattan two days ago.

24:32.003 --> 24:32.859
Get on it.

24:35.440 --> 24:36.496
Call your bosses.

24:36.797 --> 24:39.238
Tell 'em I want all the files
on this investigation.

24:39.689 --> 24:41.891
I'm getting my people back.

24:43.433 --> 24:44.091
Okay, ready?

24:44.092 --> 24:45.996
- Ready.
- One.

24:46.542 --> 24:47.250
Two.

24:47.494 --> 24:49.555
Three. Oh! Oh, jeez.

24:57.077 --> 24:57.983
Castle!

24:58.663 --> 24:59.846
Okay, can you put me down?

24:59.847 --> 25:01.189
Okay. Easy.

25:03.854 --> 25:04.652
If we ever get outta here,

25:04.653 --> 25:06.846
we should seriously consider
joining the circus.

25:07.384 --> 25:08.591
Let me try it from behind, okay?

25:09.064 --> 25:10.132
All right. I'm game.

25:15.229 --> 25:15.854
Okay.

25:15.975 --> 25:16.930
- Ready?
- Ready.

25:16.931 --> 25:18.281
One. Two.

25:18.341 --> 25:19.008
Three.

25:21.996 --> 25:23.340
Oh, okay. Oh.

25:24.328 --> 25:25.066
Okay.

25:25.311 --> 25:27.489
Okay, I'm lifting my right hand.
Ready?

25:27.726 --> 25:28.392
Okay.

25:30.887 --> 25:33.063
Not so fun as I
would've thought.

25:36.090 --> 25:36.827
You know, I'm getting
a little tired

25:36.828 --> 25:38.089
of you walking all over me.

25:41.269 --> 25:42.128
It's open.

25:43.915 --> 25:45.812
Okay, I think I can pull my--

25:51.260 --> 25:53.288
Hey! Let us outta here!

25:53.443 --> 25:54.728
What do you want from us?

26:01.062 --> 26:01.861
Captain Gates.

26:02.112 --> 26:04.518
The furniture store owner
verified that he took delivery

26:04.519 --> 26:06.088
from Spooner a
couple of days ago.

26:06.089 --> 26:07.491
But he said it was just a
couple of coffee tables,

26:07.492 --> 26:08.912
packed near the
rear of the truck.

26:08.968 --> 26:09.825
And you believed him?

26:09.989 --> 26:11.587
He's a family man,
didn't have any priors.

26:11.880 --> 26:13.748
But he did say something
happened during the delivery,

26:13.811 --> 26:14.674
something weird.

26:15.022 --> 26:16.328
As they were unloading
the shipment,

26:16.410 --> 26:18.025
a box fell off a stack and
hit him in the shoulder.

26:18.045 --> 26:19.085
He said the box must
have been empty,

26:19.086 --> 26:20.593
'cause it bounced
right off of him.

26:20.643 --> 26:21.792
He tried to joke with Spooner,

26:21.793 --> 26:24.105
asked him if he was shipping
cotton candy or air,

26:24.120 --> 26:25.833
but Spooner kind of got
squirrely, said it was just

26:25.834 --> 26:27.769
a couple of empties that were
packed there to fill some space.

26:27.819 --> 26:29.143
The owner thought it
wasn't a big deal,

26:29.144 --> 26:30.700
but then he heard something
from behind the boxes,

26:31.024 --> 26:32.549
something that sounded
like breathing.

26:33.163 --> 26:37.323
So Spooner takes a few
small, legitimate jobs

26:37.324 --> 26:39.347
in order to justify
his smuggling trips,

26:39.684 --> 26:42.098
and places a wall of
empties in front of

26:42.219 --> 26:43.625
whatever his real cargo is.

26:44.182 --> 26:46.502
D-did the owner have any idea
where Spooner was headed?

26:46.514 --> 26:47.246
None.

26:48.518 --> 26:50.358
Beckett and Castle
were on to something.

26:50.359 --> 26:51.647
Where in the hell did they go?

26:51.864 --> 26:53.881
Well, the only thing
we had at the time

26:55.179 --> 26:56.135
was this address.

26:56.184 --> 26:57.393
And we were already covering it.

26:57.915 --> 26:59.825
Oh, they must have seen
or heard something

26:59.826 --> 27:00.857
that you didn't.

27:01.760 --> 27:03.203
Okay, I want you guys to--

27:10.654 --> 27:11.459
Go! Go! Go!

27:12.236 --> 27:12.937
NYPD!

27:13.173 --> 27:13.867
NYPD!

27:14.308 --> 27:15.176
NYPD!

27:16.786 --> 27:17.658
Hold position!

27:23.330 --> 27:24.152
Room clear!

27:24.542 --> 27:25.215
Clear!

27:27.565 --> 27:28.639
This place is empty.

27:29.114 --> 27:30.299
You really think this
is where they went?

27:30.746 --> 27:32.163
If they were here,
they're not here now.

27:33.132 --> 27:34.518
Hey, detective. Look in here.

27:34.519 --> 27:35.555
There's some kind of hatch.

27:36.094 --> 27:37.759
All right.
Let's seal it off and process it.

27:56.085 --> 27:56.776
Damn it.

27:56.856 --> 27:58.059
It's hard-cased steel, Castle.

27:58.098 --> 27:59.600
We're not getting out
of these without keys.

28:02.516 --> 28:03.708
You know, there is another way.

28:06.563 --> 28:07.686
We don't go through the cuffs.

28:08.185 --> 28:09.550
You... mean...

28:09.551 --> 28:11.938
"Mad Max."
"127 Hours."

28:12.847 --> 28:14.448
Are you offering to cut
off your own hand?

28:14.449 --> 28:16.723
Whoa. Mine? No.
I was thinking about yours.

28:16.725 --> 28:18.268
My hand? Why my hand?

28:19.033 --> 28:19.940
It's smaller.

28:21.923 --> 28:22.672
They're coming.

28:28.428 --> 28:29.712
Tell him it's a good price.

28:29.848 --> 28:32.423
And if he likes her, I got two
more that fell into my lap

28:32.424 --> 28:33.880
that I could sell
you at a discount.

28:34.310 --> 28:35.660
I just need to move 'em now.

28:37.852 --> 28:39.010
That sounds like Arabic.

28:44.390 --> 28:45.521
They're going to the other room.

28:48.925 --> 28:50.337
Castle, someone
else is in there.

28:51.627 --> 28:52.707
She is very beautiful.

28:53.444 --> 28:54.809
Just like you asked.

28:57.068 --> 28:58.127
They're holding someone else.

28:58.451 --> 28:59.248
The old woman?

28:59.249 --> 29:01.372
No, it's more like
a girl, like--

29:01.563 --> 29:02.685
Like they're trying to sell her.

29:03.891 --> 29:04.884
It's human trafficking.

29:04.885 --> 29:05.851
That's what this is.

29:06.144 --> 29:07.639
They're abducting
and selling people.

29:08.294 --> 29:09.255
That's why we're still alive.

29:09.256 --> 29:10.913
They're not gonna kill us.
They're gonna sell us.

29:11.835 --> 29:14.560
What? I'm a best-selling author.

29:15.662 --> 29:16.696
I wonder what I'd be worth.

29:16.839 --> 29:17.980
Let's not find out, okay?

29:18.553 --> 29:19.389
Yeah, still...

29:22.392 --> 29:23.040
Anything?

29:23.206 --> 29:24.263
From the cut marks,

29:24.266 --> 29:25.980
looks like this hatch
was just installed.

29:26.344 --> 29:27.059
Any idea why?

29:27.233 --> 29:27.880
No.

29:27.881 --> 29:30.614
CSU is gonna sweep
for prints and trace.

29:31.614 --> 29:32.444
What did the neighbors say?

29:32.518 --> 29:35.227
Ah, that the bank foreclosed
on the previous owners,

29:35.242 --> 29:37.809
Bill and Nora Ranford,
six months ago,

29:37.917 --> 29:40.044
but a couple of weeks ago,
new neighbors moved in.

29:40.143 --> 29:40.890
Get an ID?

29:41.147 --> 29:42.385
They kinda kept a low profile.

29:42.386 --> 29:43.953
But neighbors think that
there were two of them,

29:43.954 --> 29:46.059
brothers, and they got an ID
on their ride.

29:46.445 --> 29:47.990
Black F-150.

29:48.531 --> 29:49.671
A black F-150?

29:50.167 --> 29:51.829
That means Beckett and
Castle were here.

29:51.944 --> 29:53.519
Not only that, but a
couple of nights ago,

29:53.520 --> 29:54.610
guy from across the street

29:54.611 --> 29:56.548
says he hears some noises
in the middle of the night,

29:56.549 --> 29:58.874
so he goes to the window,
and sees a semi pulling up.

29:58.892 --> 29:59.854
Spooner was here, too?

29:59.855 --> 30:03.049
Yeah. Whatever was going
on, this was the place.

30:03.509 --> 30:04.725
Why don't you wake
up the registrar?

30:04.812 --> 30:05.813
See who bought this property.

30:05.814 --> 30:06.943
I want to know who
these guys are.

30:08.889 --> 30:10.139
Hello, can you hear us?

30:13.924 --> 30:15.221
Castle, I can hear
somebody breathing.

30:15.579 --> 30:16.564
Maybe she's sedated.

30:17.066 --> 30:18.627
Hello. Can you hear us?

30:24.707 --> 30:26.129
This wall is stucco and tile.

30:26.466 --> 30:27.057
So?

30:27.211 --> 30:29.579
So the others are
all cinder block.

30:29.721 --> 30:30.747
If we start digging,

30:30.864 --> 30:32.723
we might be able to break
through and help her.

30:32.936 --> 30:35.470
How is getting out of one
prison and into another

30:35.471 --> 30:36.577
gonna help any of us?

30:37.803 --> 30:38.727
Well, let me ask you this,

30:38.728 --> 30:40.799
if it was Alexis on the other
side, what would you do?

30:46.372 --> 30:47.540
Yeah. Okay.

30:48.496 --> 30:50.125
The moment you hear. Thanks.

30:50.899 --> 30:51.699
CSU?

30:51.809 --> 30:54.234
Yeah. Negative on
prints from the house.

30:54.872 --> 30:55.681
Place was wiped.

30:56.434 --> 30:57.603
What'd you get from
the registrar?

30:57.661 --> 31:00.243
Well, the house was foreclosed
on five months ago,

31:00.333 --> 31:01.726
it's still owned
by National Bank.

31:01.727 --> 31:03.073
Our guys must have
been squatting.

31:03.074 --> 31:04.055
Did you say National Bank?

31:04.056 --> 31:04.735
Yeah, why?

31:04.985 --> 31:06.428
The files agent
Martinez sent over.

31:09.592 --> 31:10.242
Hang on.

31:12.277 --> 31:13.205
Spooner made a delivery

31:13.206 --> 31:14.789
to a Brooklyn house
two months ago.

31:15.145 --> 31:16.655
A couple of days later, the
feds raided the place,

31:16.656 --> 31:18.808
but by then, whoever was
in the house was gone.

31:18.914 --> 31:20.627
All they found was a hatch
cut into the floor,

31:20.628 --> 31:21.834
which accessed the basement.

31:21.878 --> 31:22.650
Sounds familiar.

31:22.651 --> 31:24.249
Yeah, but when they
traced the property,

31:24.282 --> 31:26.511
it was bank owned,
by National Bank.

31:27.136 --> 31:28.911
Our guys must be targeting
distressed properties

31:28.912 --> 31:30.823
- to run their operations from.
- Okay, get a list

31:30.824 --> 31:33.176
of all the National Bank-owned
properties in the New York area,

31:33.177 --> 31:35.068
starting with the properties
that have a basement.

31:35.156 --> 31:35.769
If they're working off

31:35.770 --> 31:37.098
the National Bank
foreclosure list,

31:37.099 --> 31:38.806
that may be where they're
finding their safe houses.

31:41.843 --> 31:42.744
Okay, that should do it.

31:43.227 --> 31:43.879
Shift.

31:44.293 --> 31:44.916
Okay.

31:47.497 --> 31:48.369
Okay, ready?

31:48.370 --> 31:49.037
Ready.

31:49.317 --> 31:49.903
Go.

31:53.179 --> 31:53.739
Shift over.

31:53.798 --> 31:54.535
Okay.

31:56.851 --> 31:57.464
Okay.

31:58.526 --> 31:59.409
Together. Ready?

31:59.410 --> 32:00.439
- Yeah.
- Go.

32:14.233 --> 32:15.126
I've always liked your legs,

32:15.629 --> 32:16.898
but now I respect them.

32:17.391 --> 32:18.835
Yeah, yours aren't
so bad either.

32:18.949 --> 32:20.304
You know, for the
next police picnic,

32:20.305 --> 32:21.725
we should do the
three-legged race together.

32:21.792 --> 32:23.185
You're on. All right.

32:24.838 --> 32:25.507
Hello!

32:27.159 --> 32:28.005
Can you hear us?

32:29.001 --> 32:30.086
I suppose you want
to go in first.

32:30.958 --> 32:32.171
No. You go ahead.

32:32.172 --> 32:33.565
- Don't mind if I do.
- Okay.

32:40.184 --> 32:40.898
Hello!

32:41.203 --> 32:42.600
Are you there? We're here to--

32:56.572 --> 32:57.423
A tiger?!

32:58.013 --> 33:00.044
Yeah, it's a tiger.
It almost bit my face off.

33:00.329 --> 33:02.704
Wait. No, that explains the
cage and--and the chains

33:03.165 --> 33:04.652
and the butcher knives
for the raw meat.

33:04.653 --> 33:06.455
A tiger? That's what
they were haggling over.

33:06.647 --> 33:07.811
Yeah, well, tigers
are endangered.

33:07.812 --> 33:10.076
Trafficking them is illegal.
We walked in on their operation.

33:10.077 --> 33:11.365
Yeah, walking in
on their operation

33:11.366 --> 33:12.346
is not our problem right now.

33:12.376 --> 33:14.604
That tiger walking in
here is our problem.

33:14.605 --> 33:16.487
Don't worry, Castle.
She's not gonna get through that wall.

33:17.569 --> 33:19.120
Hey, back! Get back!

33:19.425 --> 33:20.169
Is it just me,

33:20.170 --> 33:22.158
or does she look a
little bit hungry?

33:24.400 --> 33:25.448
Yeah, that's bad.

33:27.433 --> 33:28.340
What are you doing?

33:28.604 --> 33:31.585
I'm just gonna buy
us some good will.

33:31.807 --> 33:33.481
No, no, no, Castle,
don't go near her.

33:37.870 --> 33:38.747
She's going for it.

33:38.749 --> 33:41.116
Yeah, and then when
she's done with that,

33:41.117 --> 33:42.050
she'll want more.

33:43.622 --> 33:44.678
Oh, God! She's coming!

33:46.583 --> 33:48.676
So National Bank has close
to a hundred properties

33:48.677 --> 33:50.144
in foreclosure in
the outer boroughs,

33:50.145 --> 33:52.433
but our folks have certain
needs, so we filtered out

33:52.434 --> 33:54.076
all the ones without basements.

33:55.735 --> 33:57.089
Come on, Castle.
We gotta cover that hole.

33:59.051 --> 33:59.782
Push.

34:04.183 --> 34:04.837
Again.

34:06.729 --> 34:08.018
The two houses we know they used

34:08.018 --> 34:10.569
had other common elements--
close freeway access,

34:10.570 --> 34:12.864
long, wide driveways
that could fit a semi.

34:12.928 --> 34:14.953
And both are situated
in between empty lots

34:14.954 --> 34:17.621
or unoccupied houses, minimizing
the nosy neighbor factor.

34:17.646 --> 34:18.856
Now you cross-reference
all that,

34:18.857 --> 34:21.330
it leaves us with 11 likelies
in the outer boroughs.

34:23.833 --> 34:24.493
Beckett.

34:26.616 --> 34:27.433
What do we do?

34:27.762 --> 34:28.719
Divvy up the list.

34:28.945 --> 34:30.989
Get unis out to all
11 properties,

34:31.327 --> 34:33.053
and let's bring them back alive.

34:34.755 --> 34:35.559
We get in the freezer.

34:35.560 --> 34:36.954
It'll latch, and
we'll suffocate.

34:37.204 --> 34:38.400
Would you rather be eaten?

34:38.402 --> 34:39.777
I was looking for option three.

34:43.034 --> 34:43.880
Get behind me.

34:49.058 --> 34:49.994
I have a plan.

34:51.507 --> 34:52.933
817 Fincher Drive.

34:54.052 --> 34:56.045
Industrial building foreclosed
on eight months ago.

34:59.870 --> 35:01.562
Looks empty, just like
the last three places.

35:02.236 --> 35:03.091
Let's do a walk around.

35:03.092 --> 35:04.444
See if there's anything in back.

35:04.445 --> 35:05.694
Yeah.

35:20.426 --> 35:21.389
This is your plan?

35:21.390 --> 35:23.879
Do you know how high
tigers can jump?

35:26.374 --> 35:27.133
High.

35:27.134 --> 35:29.034
Well, we're still
alive, aren't we?

35:30.147 --> 35:31.104
Okay.

35:31.105 --> 35:32.224
Ooh.

35:36.439 --> 35:37.944
Esposito, over here.

35:44.596 --> 35:45.964
Call for backup.

35:55.260 --> 35:56.462
Remember what I said about
joining the circus?

35:56.463 --> 35:57.979
- Uh-huh.
- Changed my mind.

35:59.512 --> 36:00.906
Whoa!

36:01.610 --> 36:02.964
She's playing with us.

36:03.069 --> 36:04.218
She's gonna knock it over.

36:04.219 --> 36:05.510
What are we gonna do?

36:05.913 --> 36:07.413
There's only one thing to do.

36:08.099 --> 36:09.603
Scream like little girls.

36:09.604 --> 36:10.989
Help!

36:11.398 --> 36:12.188
Help!

36:12.189 --> 36:13.547
Help!

36:14.090 --> 36:15.288
- Get us outta here!
- Wait. Listen.

36:15.289 --> 36:16.755
- Help! Somebody!
- You hear that?

36:16.756 --> 36:18.808
- Yeah.
- Come on! We're down here!

36:21.955 --> 36:25.012
Help! Somebody, help us!

36:26.049 --> 36:27.692
Help! Help!

36:28.705 --> 36:29.833
Beckett, Castle.

36:29.834 --> 36:31.121
Esposito.

36:32.102 --> 36:32.905
Is that a tiger?!

36:32.906 --> 36:35.112
Yeah, yeah, that's a tiger.

36:35.688 --> 36:37.454
Hey, how about getting us out?

36:37.596 --> 36:39.980
O-okay, hang on.
We'll-- we'll be right there.

36:41.877 --> 36:44.643
Drop the hardware, boys, or
I'll blow you both away.

36:44.644 --> 36:46.309
Help! Help us!

36:46.310 --> 36:48.467
You guys, open the hatch!

36:51.331 --> 36:53.900
- Guys!
- Ryan, Espo, help!

36:53.901 --> 36:56.647
- Open the door, boys!
- Help!

37:05.214 --> 37:06.406
Put your weapon down.

37:06.407 --> 37:09.066
Doesn't matter which one
of us you shoot first,

37:09.136 --> 37:10.997
whoever's left standing
will kill you.

37:10.998 --> 37:13.241
Maybe I'll shoot the
pretty one first.

37:15.483 --> 37:17.207
Luckily, I don't gotta choose.

37:18.958 --> 37:20.497
Y'all put 'em down.

37:21.248 --> 37:22.172
You first.

37:22.291 --> 37:23.847
Let's just kill 'em, ma.

37:23.848 --> 37:25.966
Let Tony the tiger have at
the others like we planned.

37:25.967 --> 37:27.403
Get us outta here!

37:27.404 --> 37:28.450
Open the door!

37:28.451 --> 37:30.800
The stakes are
considerably raised!

37:31.940 --> 37:33.158
Help!

37:33.159 --> 37:34.931
- Help!
- Help us!

37:34.932 --> 37:36.442
- Your boys shoot...
- Get us outta here!

37:36.443 --> 37:37.508
I swear, the last thing I do

37:37.509 --> 37:39.441
is put a bullet right
through your head.

37:39.442 --> 37:41.948
- Your choice.
- Come on. Hurry up!

37:41.949 --> 37:43.211
You New Yorkers ain't
nearly as scary

37:43.212 --> 37:44.382
as a Texas lawman.

37:44.383 --> 37:45.185
That being said,

37:45.186 --> 37:47.501
I'm betting more of you
are gonna be here soon,

37:47.502 --> 37:49.251
so I'm gonna tell you
what's gonna happen.

37:49.252 --> 37:51.993
Me and my boys are gonna
back on outta here.

37:51.994 --> 37:53.838
You either get yourselves
killed trying to stop us...

37:53.839 --> 37:56.758
or you can forget all about
us and go save your friends.

37:56.759 --> 37:58.452
That's your choice.

38:05.663 --> 38:08.884
I'm so sorry.
I've got nothing else.

38:13.382 --> 38:14.687
Javi?

38:14.688 --> 38:15.211
Kate--

38:15.212 --> 38:18.821
No, Castle, I did not survive
a bullet to the heart

38:18.822 --> 38:20.978
to die as tiger kibble.

38:34.667 --> 38:35.997
Let 'em go.

38:46.424 --> 38:47.798
Oh, God.

38:47.799 --> 38:49.192
It ate 'em.

38:49.193 --> 38:50.990
It didn't eat us.

38:52.287 --> 38:54.807
But it will if you don't hurry.

38:54.808 --> 38:56.314
Nice hangout.

39:04.895 --> 39:06.646
Nobody move!

39:11.823 --> 39:13.758
Handcuffed together that long?

39:13.813 --> 39:15.292
I'm surprised you two
didn't kill each other.

39:15.293 --> 39:16.519
Yeah, well, there were
a couple of moments.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.779
Until we found our rhythm.

39:18.780 --> 39:20.675
I think we'll fly to Florida.

39:21.957 --> 39:23.147
What?

39:23.457 --> 39:25.356
I believe this is yours.

39:25.962 --> 39:27.396
- This, too.
- Thank you.

39:27.397 --> 39:28.797
How did you guys...

39:33.474 --> 39:34.417
even find us?

39:34.418 --> 39:35.618
Well, we followed
your bread crumbs,

39:35.619 --> 39:36.468
and it led us here.

39:36.469 --> 39:39.298
And lucky for all of us,
some of my detectives

39:39.299 --> 39:41.470
keep me informed as
to their whereabouts.

39:41.471 --> 39:43.071
Thanks to you two,

39:43.072 --> 39:46.148
I'm instituting a new
policy in our department--

39:46.271 --> 39:49.248
no one goes anywhere...

39:49.837 --> 39:51.572
without calling it in.

39:55.444 --> 39:57.156
Thanks, you guys.
Really appreciate that.

39:57.157 --> 39:58.593
Well, at least we won't
have to look so hard

39:58.594 --> 40:00.380
next time we save your ass.

40:00.381 --> 40:01.374
I missed you, by the way.

40:01.375 --> 40:03.343
- Really? Prove it.
- Oh, I'll prove it.

40:03.344 --> 40:04.117
- How was that tiger?
- Espo, stop it.

40:04.118 --> 40:05.733
- What?
- Was it gr-r-reat?

40:05.734 --> 40:07.198
Her name is Ruth Spurloch.

40:07.199 --> 40:09.168
And it turns out,
her and her sons

40:09.169 --> 40:11.630
were major suppliers
of endangered tigers

40:11.631 --> 40:13.820
to wealthy customers
all around the world.

40:13.821 --> 40:15.268
Hard to believe it's
worth killing for.

40:15.269 --> 40:18.103
The exotic animal trade's a
billion-dollar industry.

40:18.104 --> 40:20.454
And Texas, which has
almost no regulations,

40:20.455 --> 40:22.063
is one of the few
places in the world

40:22.064 --> 40:24.863
where selling and breeding
tigers is not illegal.

40:24.864 --> 40:27.767
Ruth and her boys were making
millions off her breeding farm.

40:27.768 --> 40:30.665
Spooner would truck them
from Del Rio up to New York.

40:30.666 --> 40:32.139
And then wealthy clients
would smuggle them

40:32.140 --> 40:34.710
past customs and ship 'em
out on their private jets.

40:34.711 --> 40:35.279
Right.

40:35.280 --> 40:36.797
Except outside of Texas,

40:36.798 --> 40:39.922
trafficking endangered species
is a criminal offense.

40:39.923 --> 40:42.741
So Ruth didn't want
Spooner ratting her out.

40:42.742 --> 40:44.419
Which is why, when we
showed up at her house,

40:44.420 --> 40:46.389
she played the victim so she
could get the drop on us.

40:46.390 --> 40:48.450
Yeah, and knocked us out
using animal tranquilizers,

40:48.451 --> 40:49.548
which can't be good for me.

40:49.549 --> 40:51.992
I-I still have a
taste in my mouth.

40:52.565 --> 40:53.923
Yeah.

40:54.700 --> 40:55.828
Well, I...

40:55.829 --> 40:57.710
I'm--I'm gonna turn
the trafficking case

40:57.711 --> 40:59.398
over to the FBI and customs.

40:59.399 --> 41:01.697
You can coordinate with
them on your murder charge.

41:01.698 --> 41:04.880
Thank you, agent Martinez.
I'll walk you out.

41:07.235 --> 41:08.403
Hey.

41:08.679 --> 41:10.900
As expected, the hair
from the truck is tiger,

41:10.901 --> 41:12.217
and the blood is from raw meat.

41:12.218 --> 41:14.032
They used the hatches to
throw down food to the cats

41:14.033 --> 41:15.524
or sedate them with darts.

41:15.525 --> 41:17.113
So what's gonna happen
with that tiger anyway?

41:17.114 --> 41:18.274
Shoot him.

41:19.469 --> 41:21.227
She'll get transferred
to a sanctuary.

41:21.228 --> 41:22.389
Or that.

41:22.837 --> 41:23.930
Probably end up in a zoo.

41:23.931 --> 41:24.978
Why, you want to
go and visit her?

41:24.979 --> 41:27.611
No. No, thanks. I'm good.

41:27.875 --> 41:29.239
- All right, you guys get some rest.
- You, too.

41:29.240 --> 41:29.991
Yeah.

41:29.992 --> 41:33.474
That has gotta be the strangest
brush with death I've ever had.

41:33.475 --> 41:34.565
Me, too.

41:34.566 --> 41:36.484
But I'll tell you,
after that experience,

41:36.485 --> 41:39.079
if I ever have to be hitched
to someone, it would be you.

41:40.266 --> 41:41.613
Hitched?

41:41.894 --> 41:42.763
Hitched?

41:42.764 --> 41:45.067
No, I didn't say "hitched."
I said "cuffed."

41:45.068 --> 41:46.612
Handcuffed, not hitched--

41:46.613 --> 41:48.606
the colloquial or any other
connotation or meaning.

41:48.607 --> 41:50.412
It's okay, Castle.
I understood what you meant.

41:50.413 --> 41:52.790
And for what it's worth,
if I ever have to spend

41:52.791 --> 41:55.398
another night handcuffed
to someone again,

41:55.669 --> 41:58.035
I wouldn't mind if
it was you either.

41:58.036 --> 41:59.045
Really?

41:59.046 --> 42:00.535
But next time,

42:01.036 --> 42:02.974
let's do it without the tiger.

42:05.358 --> 42:06.845
Next time?

42:18.660 --> 42:22.653
