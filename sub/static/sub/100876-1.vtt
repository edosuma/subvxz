[shattering]

01:04.890 --> 01:07.806
[slow music]

01:21.994 --> 01:22.865
I did not.

01:22.908 --> 01:24.127
David: Yes, you did.

01:24.171 --> 01:24.910
I remember.

01:24.954 --> 01:25.389
I'm telling you.

01:25.433 --> 01:26.782
I didn't.

01:26.825 --> 01:30.046
I fell asleep on your
shoulder on our first date.

01:30.090 --> 01:30.786
Cheers.

01:30.829 --> 01:31.352
I love you.

01:31.395 --> 01:32.135
I love you too.

01:32.179 --> 01:33.310
Yeah, I remember.

01:34.746 --> 01:36.487
Our first date was mini golf.

01:36.531 --> 01:38.054
Do you remember?

01:38.098 --> 01:39.447
You kept hitting the windmill.

01:39.490 --> 01:41.275
And you were getting
so frustrated.

01:41.318 --> 01:42.711
And the little boy behind us--

01:42.754 --> 01:43.451
OK.

01:43.494 --> 01:44.147
He got a hole in one.

01:44.191 --> 01:45.279
All right.

01:45.322 --> 01:46.149
We don't have to
relive my humiliation.

01:46.193 --> 01:47.194
Yeah.

01:48.369 --> 01:49.674
Wait, how could I
have fallen asleep

01:49.718 --> 01:51.850
on your shoulder
during mini golf?

01:51.894 --> 01:52.982
Hmm.

01:54.375 --> 01:56.464
Yeah, I guess it must have
been another first date.

01:56.507 --> 01:57.900
Oh, that's very funny.

01:57.943 --> 01:59.858
Oh, I've had a lot
of first dates, hon.

01:59.902 --> 02:01.121
Oh, really?

02:01.164 --> 02:04.472
Well, you've got to
check a couple oysters

02:04.515 --> 02:05.690
before you find a pearl.

02:11.087 --> 02:12.349
Annie?

02:13.742 --> 02:15.004
Oh!

02:15.047 --> 02:17.702
You guys are home already.

02:17.746 --> 02:20.009
How was your anniversary dinner?

02:20.052 --> 02:21.837
It was OK, right?

02:21.880 --> 02:24.187
[inaudible] at sunset,
steak and lobster--

02:24.231 --> 02:25.449
isn't that your favorite?

02:25.493 --> 02:26.798
I hate you.

02:26.842 --> 02:29.671
Oh, well, that's
too bad because I'll

02:29.714 --> 02:32.021
have to eat that apple
cobbler all by myself.

02:32.064 --> 02:33.805
Ice cream?

02:33.849 --> 02:34.502
Two scoops.

02:34.545 --> 02:36.156
I'll heat it up.

02:36.199 --> 02:38.027
The, uh-- the cobbler, not the--

02:38.070 --> 02:38.549
We get it.

02:38.593 --> 02:39.289
--ice cream.

02:39.333 --> 02:39.985
You get it.

02:42.379 --> 02:43.685
You're late.

02:43.728 --> 02:45.295
You guys said you were
gonna be home by 11:00.

02:45.339 --> 02:46.340
No.

02:46.383 --> 02:47.732
We told you to be home at 9:00.

02:47.776 --> 02:48.385
No.

02:48.429 --> 02:49.473
You told me that.

02:49.517 --> 02:50.692
David doesn't care.

02:50.735 --> 02:51.258
Yeah.

02:52.911 --> 02:54.304
Well, when David goes through 18
hours of labor and an emergency

02:54.348 --> 02:56.741
C-section, then he can
weigh in on your curfew too.

02:56.785 --> 02:57.264
Ew!

02:57.307 --> 02:59.179
Mom, gross.

02:59.222 --> 03:00.005
Ladies?

03:00.049 --> 03:00.571
Come on.

03:00.615 --> 03:01.093
It's melting.

03:04.314 --> 03:08.188
[crickets chirping]

03:09.754 --> 03:12.235
I can't even remember what
life was like without you.

03:12.279 --> 03:14.194
I know.

03:14.237 --> 03:16.587
I know.

03:16.631 --> 03:17.762
Yeah, that's good.

03:17.806 --> 03:19.851
Mm-hm.

03:19.895 --> 03:26.989
You know, when Jeff died,
I thought I'd be alone.

03:27.032 --> 03:28.295
Then you came along.

03:28.338 --> 03:31.036
And I stalked you till
you said yes to a date.

03:31.080 --> 03:34.257
'Cause you were-- you
were 10 years younger, babe.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.389
I thought you were joking.

03:35.432 --> 03:36.390
Hm.

03:36.433 --> 03:37.913
And I thought you were perfect.

03:37.956 --> 03:39.610
Mm.

03:39.654 --> 03:41.656
You know you and Annie
are the best things that

03:41.699 --> 03:42.961
ever happened to me, right?

03:43.005 --> 03:45.790
[gentle music]

03:52.536 --> 03:54.277
How many days are
you going for again?

03:54.321 --> 03:55.844
Just overnight, hon.

03:55.887 --> 03:57.933
Yeah, my boss wants an
aerial survey of the island.

03:57.976 --> 03:59.761
And he needs you
there for that?

03:59.804 --> 04:01.850
Well, he'd like to know
what he's getting himself

04:01.893 --> 04:03.721
into before he
invests $60 million.

04:03.765 --> 04:06.768
Real estate developers
tend to be funny that way.

04:06.811 --> 04:08.378
Yeah, so I'll be just
flying into Sea-Tac,

04:08.422 --> 04:10.989
and then Carter's fly us
back out in his private plane

04:11.033 --> 04:13.035
to do the survey.

04:13.078 --> 04:14.341
La de da.

04:14.384 --> 04:15.603
Oh, yeah.

04:15.646 --> 04:17.213
And his plane's the
size of a hatchback

04:17.257 --> 04:18.387
and about as airworthy.

04:18.432 --> 04:19.694
Oh, really?

04:19.737 --> 04:21.043
And that's supposed to
make me feel better?

04:26.483 --> 04:30.226
When-- when were you
at the Heights Hotel?

04:30.270 --> 04:32.228
Isn't that downtown?

04:32.272 --> 04:33.621
Oh, yeah.

04:33.664 --> 04:34.752
No, this is where we had
our conference this year,

04:34.796 --> 04:36.101
back in April, remember?

04:36.145 --> 04:36.537
Oh, right.

04:36.580 --> 04:37.625
Yeah.

04:37.668 --> 04:39.017
But wait.

04:39.061 --> 04:40.149
They give you a hotel room
key for the conference?

04:40.192 --> 04:41.411
Well, yeah.

04:41.455 --> 04:42.456
I mean, we gotta take
meetings somewhere.

04:42.499 --> 04:43.108
Their conference rooms stink.

04:43.152 --> 04:44.371
Oh.

04:44.414 --> 04:45.676
[phone buzzing]

04:45.720 --> 04:46.460
All right.

04:46.503 --> 04:47.243
My car's here.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.766
I gotta run.

04:48.810 --> 04:49.376
You're gonna pick me up from
the airport tomorrow, right?

04:49.419 --> 04:50.377
Yeah.

04:50.420 --> 04:51.334
Just text me when you land.

04:51.378 --> 04:53.162
[phone ringing]

04:53.205 --> 04:54.119
[huffs]

04:54.163 --> 04:55.164
The bank keeps calling.

04:55.207 --> 04:55.904
DAVID: Oh, yeah.

04:55.947 --> 04:56.687
I'll take care of that.

04:56.731 --> 04:57.514
Should I answer it?

04:57.558 --> 04:58.428
No, no.

04:58.472 --> 04:59.429
Don't worry about it.

04:59.473 --> 05:00.038
I'll call as soon as I land.

05:00.082 --> 05:00.909
OK.

05:00.952 --> 05:01.475
She keeps leaving messages.

05:01.518 --> 05:02.258
Yeah.

05:02.302 --> 05:02.954
No, it's fine.

05:02.998 --> 05:03.477
I got it.

05:03.520 --> 05:04.216
Bye, babe.

05:04.260 --> 05:05.000
I love you.

05:05.043 --> 05:06.044
I love you too.

05:13.922 --> 05:15.445
Good morning, sweetheart.

05:15.489 --> 05:16.098
Hey.

05:18.927 --> 05:20.537
You all set for
your English test?

05:20.581 --> 05:21.712
I should be.

05:21.756 --> 05:23.105
I studied last night
when I got home.

05:23.148 --> 05:25.107
You mean when
you got home late?

05:25.150 --> 05:25.716
No.

05:28.240 --> 05:31.548
Oh, by the way, I might be a
little bit late picking you up

05:31.592 --> 05:32.767
after school today.

05:32.810 --> 05:34.159
I've got an assignment
this afternoon,

05:34.203 --> 05:37.337
and I think I have
to edit tonight.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.034
I'm just going to walk.

05:39.077 --> 05:40.557
Are you sure?

05:40.601 --> 05:42.167
Yep.

05:42.211 --> 05:44.300
OK, will you make sure you
come home right after school?

05:44.344 --> 05:45.823
Why?

05:45.867 --> 05:48.391
Because you're on thin ice
after being late last night.

05:48.435 --> 05:50.480
When am I not on thin ice?

05:50.524 --> 05:51.873
Oh, I don't know.

05:51.916 --> 05:56.181
There was maybe two
weeks in the sixth grade.

05:56.225 --> 05:57.226
Goodbye, mom.

05:57.269 --> 05:58.096
Bye.

05:58.140 --> 05:58.706
Bye.

05:58.749 --> 06:00.098
I love you.

06:00.142 --> 06:01.012
I love you too.

06:06.583 --> 06:09.064
[camera clicks]

06:12.110 --> 06:15.026
Karen!

06:15.070 --> 06:15.984
Hey, Neil.

06:16.027 --> 06:17.464
Hey.

06:17.507 --> 06:18.769
Checking up on me?

06:18.813 --> 06:20.118
I haven't seen the
sun in a couple weeks.

06:20.162 --> 06:21.642
I just figured I
should, you know,

06:21.685 --> 06:24.558
make sure it's still here.

06:24.601 --> 06:25.907
Long day?

06:25.950 --> 06:27.343
It is.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.128
It's hard keeping the
newspaper afloat these days.

06:30.172 --> 06:31.391
Yeah.

06:31.434 --> 06:33.480
Especially with how
much we got to pay you.

06:33.523 --> 06:36.483
Can I see?

06:36.526 --> 06:38.746
I think this one's good.

06:38.789 --> 06:40.617
You're great.

06:40.661 --> 06:41.923
Perfect.

06:41.966 --> 06:44.447
Who's writing the story?

06:44.491 --> 06:45.448
Who knows?

06:45.492 --> 06:47.581
I just look at the pictures.

06:47.624 --> 06:49.365
Look, what's it going
to take to get you

06:49.409 --> 06:50.671
to come work for us full time?

06:50.714 --> 06:52.107
Ah.

06:52.150 --> 06:55.153
You know, I'm kind of
liking my freelance life.

06:55.197 --> 06:58.113
David's been so busy with
work, and Annie, well, she

06:58.156 --> 07:01.421
probably wishes I'd
spend more time at work.

07:01.464 --> 07:02.509
17?

07:02.552 --> 07:04.249
Just turned.

07:04.293 --> 07:07.470
When Kaylee was 17,
she wrecked two cars

07:07.514 --> 07:09.646
and tried to run away.

07:09.690 --> 07:10.908
After the second car, I just--

07:10.952 --> 07:12.910
I wish I just-- just
let her, you know?

07:12.954 --> 07:14.956
Yeah, but she
turned out, though.

07:14.999 --> 07:16.610
You've been a good dad.

07:16.653 --> 07:18.133
I know Faith would
have been proud.

07:21.005 --> 07:23.573
So how is David
handling fatherhood?

07:23.617 --> 07:26.576
Oh, he loves it
and she loves him.

07:26.620 --> 07:30.885
I'm the one she's not so
crazy about these days, but--

07:30.928 --> 07:32.277
Everybody loves David.

07:32.321 --> 07:33.670
No, I know.

07:33.714 --> 07:35.498
The three of us should
get together soon.

07:35.542 --> 07:36.325
Yeah.

07:36.368 --> 07:37.935
That'd be great.

07:37.979 --> 07:39.633
He's traveling a lot, but I'll
talk to him when he's back,

07:39.676 --> 07:41.504
and then we'll put
something in the books.

07:41.548 --> 07:42.897
OK.

07:42.940 --> 07:44.115
And I'll get those pictures
by the end of the week?

07:44.159 --> 07:45.073
You'd get them by
the end of the day

07:45.116 --> 07:46.509
if you'd let me do my work.

07:46.553 --> 07:47.162
OK.

07:47.205 --> 07:48.772
[laughs]

07:48.816 --> 07:49.469
All right, I'll talk to you when
you check doesn't clear, OK?

07:49.512 --> 07:50.339
All right.

07:50.382 --> 07:51.732
Bye, Neil.

07:55.387 --> 07:56.345
[sighs]

07:56.388 --> 07:58.216
[phone rings]

07:59.304 --> 08:01.002
Hello?

08:01.045 --> 08:02.482
Yes, this is Karen Miller.

08:09.053 --> 08:09.793
What?

08:09.837 --> 08:13.275
[ominous music]

08:16.365 --> 08:18.019
Mom?

08:18.715 --> 08:19.760
Are you OK?

08:19.803 --> 08:21.544
Yeah.

08:21.588 --> 08:27.724
Um, some-- it's-- it's David.

08:27.768 --> 08:29.639
David?

08:29.683 --> 08:33.207
Well, where is he?

08:33.251 --> 08:36.472
I thought he was
on a business trip.

08:36.515 --> 08:39.823
He's-- he's-- he's gone.

08:39.866 --> 08:43.000
He's gone?

08:43.044 --> 08:46.134
Um, he was in
his client's plane,

08:46.177 --> 08:49.485
and, um, the plane went
down over the water.

08:49.529 --> 08:52.444
And, um, they couldn't find him.

08:52.488 --> 08:55.839
Well, if they couldn't find
him, he could be OK, right?

08:55.883 --> 08:58.276
He could be fine?

08:58.320 --> 08:59.539
Yeah, I know.

08:59.582 --> 09:06.371
Um, but they searched,
you know, for hours.

09:06.415 --> 09:08.722
He's dead, Annie.

09:08.765 --> 09:11.333
[cries]

09:11.376 --> 09:14.336
He was just here.

09:14.379 --> 09:15.250
I know.

09:15.293 --> 09:17.078
He was just here this morning.

09:17.121 --> 09:19.341
I know.

09:19.384 --> 09:22.866
[soft music]

10:19.706 --> 10:22.622
[sighs]

10:32.066 --> 10:35.591
[gentle music]

11:05.316 --> 11:06.230
Hey, Neil.

11:09.059 --> 11:10.408
I hope I'm not calling too late.

11:13.934 --> 11:15.718
Karen, I--

11:15.762 --> 11:16.937
I'm-- I'm so sorry.

11:19.461 --> 11:21.855
David was a great guy,
and I know how much he

11:21.898 --> 11:23.726
cared about you and Annie and--

11:27.687 --> 11:30.515
I know.

11:30.559 --> 11:32.735
How is she?

11:32.779 --> 11:34.128
She's good.

11:34.171 --> 11:37.348
I just-- I'm worried
about her because she's--

11:37.392 --> 11:39.873
she was just
starting to, um, you

11:39.916 --> 11:42.527
know, to recover
after Jeff's death.

11:42.571 --> 11:44.660
You think she
still blames you?

11:44.704 --> 11:46.053
I was the one driving.

11:46.096 --> 11:50.405
But that drunk guy, he
crossed over into your lane.

11:50.448 --> 11:53.060
There's nothing you
could have done.

11:53.103 --> 11:55.410
I just don't know how
she's going to process this.

11:55.453 --> 11:59.196
You know, it's a lot
of loss for a kid.

11:59.240 --> 12:00.763
For both of you.

12:00.807 --> 12:03.287
I don't know how we're going
to get through this again.

12:07.030 --> 12:09.903
It's OK.

12:09.946 --> 12:11.382
You'll be fine, I promise, OK?

12:15.691 --> 12:17.911
You were there for me
when my Faith died.

12:17.954 --> 12:20.087
Now let me be there for you, OK?

12:20.130 --> 12:21.784
Thank you.

12:21.828 --> 12:24.352
Oh, here's your
memory card back.

12:24.395 --> 12:26.093
Thanks.

12:26.136 --> 12:28.791
Are you sure you're OK
editing those things for me?

12:28.835 --> 12:29.923
Focus on your family.

12:29.966 --> 12:30.793
I got this.

12:30.837 --> 12:31.359
OK.

12:34.797 --> 12:39.671
If there's anything
you need, please call me.

12:39.715 --> 12:40.629
I will.

12:40.672 --> 12:42.022
I mean that.

12:42.065 --> 12:43.414
Alright.

12:43.458 --> 12:44.198
OK.

12:44.241 --> 12:47.331
[ominous music]

13:20.016 --> 13:23.106
[bell tolling]

13:27.502 --> 13:28.068
Mom?

13:30.418 --> 13:34.291
We should probably
go to the church now.

13:34.335 --> 13:35.292
Everyone's waiting.

13:37.991 --> 13:38.992
You go ahead.

13:39.035 --> 13:42.691
I just need a few more minutes.

13:42.734 --> 13:45.346
I'll wait with you.

13:45.389 --> 13:46.826
No, you should
get to the church.

13:49.741 --> 13:50.438
Are you sure?

13:53.876 --> 13:54.703
Yeah.

13:54.746 --> 13:55.399
I'll be right there.

14:12.764 --> 14:14.679
Oh, David.

14:21.077 --> 14:24.037
[kisses fingers]

14:24.080 --> 14:28.128
[inhales deeply]

14:37.006 --> 14:37.659
Excuse me?

14:42.707 --> 14:43.143
Wait.

14:43.186 --> 14:43.839
Please!

14:43.883 --> 14:44.492
Please!

14:44.535 --> 14:46.755
Excuse me.

14:46.798 --> 14:47.887
Please stop.

14:47.930 --> 14:51.368
[fast music]

14:56.808 --> 15:00.290
[rain splashing on roof]

15:10.474 --> 15:11.519
Are you OK, sweetheart?

15:15.001 --> 15:19.875
I'm fine, I guess.

15:20.876 --> 15:24.184
For a second there, I
expected him to open the door

15:24.227 --> 15:26.186
and ask us how his funeral was.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.060
So stupid.

15:31.104 --> 15:33.628
It's not stupid, baby.

15:33.671 --> 15:37.849
It's just-- it's going to
take us some time to adjust.

15:44.073 --> 15:45.640
Hm.

15:45.683 --> 15:48.469
Do you remember when I first
brought him over to meet you?

15:51.863 --> 15:55.128
He really wanted to make
a good impression on you.

15:55.171 --> 15:59.480
He brought me that
pink teddy bear--

15:59.523 --> 16:03.397
kept making those
dumb bear puns.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.921
It's beary nice to meet you.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.228
The spaghetti's beary good.

16:08.271 --> 16:12.188
[laughs]

16:12.232 --> 16:14.277
Why didn't you want
me to wait with you?

16:14.321 --> 16:15.975
What do you mean?

16:16.018 --> 16:18.368
At the graveyard.

16:18.412 --> 16:19.500
Oh, no, no, no, sweetheart.

16:19.543 --> 16:20.892
It wasn't like that.

16:20.936 --> 16:22.938
It was just because
there were people waiting

16:22.982 --> 16:25.767
for us at the church,
and I thought one of us

16:25.810 --> 16:28.465
should get there.

16:28.509 --> 16:29.553
I could have waited.

16:32.078 --> 16:34.036
Sometimes I just feel like I--

16:34.080 --> 16:36.256
[phone rings]

16:36.299 --> 16:37.170
--like I'm in the way.

16:37.213 --> 16:38.475
I turned it off.

16:38.519 --> 16:39.999
I'm gonna get changed.

16:40.042 --> 16:40.869
No, wait.

16:40.912 --> 16:42.740
Annie, hold on a second.

16:42.784 --> 16:44.307
Hello?

16:44.351 --> 16:46.657
Mrs. Miller, hi.

16:46.701 --> 16:48.703
This is Barbara
Waldron from the bank.

16:48.746 --> 16:50.705
I've been trying to reach you.

16:50.748 --> 16:52.794
Hi, Barbara.

16:52.837 --> 16:53.664
I'm so sorry.

16:53.708 --> 16:54.622
David was going to call you.

16:54.665 --> 16:55.623
BARBARA [ON PHONE]: I'm sorry.

16:55.666 --> 16:57.712
I know it's a terrible time.

16:57.755 --> 17:00.454
Would it be OK if I
called you next week?

17:00.497 --> 17:02.151
BARBARA [ON PHONE]:
I'm afraid not.

17:02.195 --> 17:04.196
It's about your mortgage.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.849
Our mortgage?

17:05.894 --> 17:08.549
BARBARA [ON PHONE]: You're two
months behind on your payment.

17:08.592 --> 17:11.073
And I talked to them
today, but they--

17:11.117 --> 17:11.987
Barbara, I don't--

17:12.031 --> 17:15.034
I don't have a mortgage.

17:15.077 --> 17:16.557
Mrs. Miller, I
think you better

17:16.599 --> 17:18.298
come into my office tomorrow.

17:22.998 --> 17:23.912
Have a seat.

17:23.954 --> 17:25.348
Thank you.

17:25.392 --> 17:27.262
Would you like some coffee?

17:27.307 --> 17:28.917
Uh, no, thank you.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.353
Thank you, Lexi.

17:30.397 --> 17:32.573
Please, have a seat.

17:32.616 --> 17:35.750
Barbara, what is this about?

17:35.793 --> 17:39.058
First of all, I am
so sorry about David.

17:39.101 --> 17:44.237
And I'm sorry to have to
do this so soon, but--

17:44.280 --> 17:46.021
[sighs]

17:46.065 --> 17:50.634
Did he talk to you about
the messages that we left?

17:50.678 --> 17:52.680
Uh, no.

17:52.723 --> 17:56.118
He just said he was
going to take care of it.

17:56.162 --> 17:57.902
You better take
a look at these.

18:00.644 --> 18:04.996
You're more than 60 days
past due on your mortgages.

18:05.040 --> 18:08.087
And the bank is preparing
foreclosure procedures.

18:08.130 --> 18:09.349
Yes, but I don't--

18:09.392 --> 18:11.612
I don't understand.

18:11.655 --> 18:14.658
Like I said on the phone,
I don't have a mortgage.

18:14.702 --> 18:17.052
I paid it off five years ago.

18:17.096 --> 18:23.450
Yes, but you took out a
new mortgage early last year.

18:23.493 --> 18:24.103
No, I didn't.

18:28.672 --> 18:30.587
I didn't agree to this.

18:30.631 --> 18:34.809
That's your
signature, isn't it?

18:34.852 --> 18:35.810
[sighs]

18:35.853 --> 18:36.550
Yes, but I--

18:36.593 --> 18:40.031
I-- I didn't sign it.

18:40.075 --> 18:41.729
Are you sure?

18:41.772 --> 18:43.252
Yeah.

18:43.296 --> 18:45.472
I think I'd remember if I
took out a six-figure loan.

18:45.515 --> 18:47.865
Let me talk with the
home lending department.

18:47.909 --> 18:50.172
But, Karen, please
take my advice.

18:50.216 --> 18:52.479
You need to get current on this.

18:52.522 --> 18:56.265
You need to pay this
as soon as possible

18:56.309 --> 18:58.441
within the next few days.

18:58.485 --> 18:59.660
How much are we talking?

19:08.277 --> 19:10.323
Now, if there's
been some mistake,

19:10.366 --> 19:12.803
we can get it corrected.

19:12.847 --> 19:15.415
But, trust me, you
do not want to go

19:15.458 --> 19:16.720
into foreclosure proceedings.

19:23.074 --> 19:26.556
[car motor whirring]

19:38.264 --> 19:40.744
[door slams]

19:44.139 --> 19:44.792
Oh.

19:44.835 --> 19:45.749
Hey, Neil.

19:45.793 --> 19:46.576
Hey.

19:46.620 --> 19:47.795
What are you doing here?

19:47.838 --> 19:49.536
Sorry, I'm just
dropping off your check.

19:49.579 --> 19:51.233
I don't want to disturb you.

19:51.277 --> 19:52.365
Oh.

19:52.408 --> 19:55.498
Your memory
card's in there too.

19:55.542 --> 19:56.717
Thank you.

19:56.760 --> 19:57.718
Is everything OK?

20:00.764 --> 20:03.202
You wanna talk about it?

20:03.245 --> 20:04.464
Yeah.

20:04.507 --> 20:06.292
Would you like to come
in for a cup of tea?

20:06.335 --> 20:07.118
Yeah, sure.

20:11.949 --> 20:14.822
All right, I don't understand.

20:14.865 --> 20:16.911
You're behind in your mortgage.

20:16.954 --> 20:18.565
Do-- do you need to
borrow some money?

20:18.608 --> 20:20.393
Karen, I'm happy to
help you if you need it.

20:20.436 --> 20:21.437
No.

20:21.481 --> 20:23.396
No, see, that's not the problem.

20:23.439 --> 20:24.788
I don't have a mortgage.

20:24.832 --> 20:27.574
I paid it off after Jeff died.

20:27.617 --> 20:28.923
So then where'd it come from?

20:28.966 --> 20:30.925
It was taken out this year.

20:30.968 --> 20:33.188
Apparently I signed for it.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.408
And this is the first
you're hearing about it?

20:35.451 --> 20:36.844
Yeah.

20:36.887 --> 20:38.802
After we got married, David
took over the finances,

20:38.846 --> 20:41.979
so I just signed off
on all the paperwork.

20:42.023 --> 20:44.243
I didn't think to ask him
if he took out a mortgage.

20:46.854 --> 20:51.337
So then if he did, what
happened to all that money?

20:51.380 --> 20:53.426
I don't know.

20:53.469 --> 20:55.471
Maybe he invested it?

20:55.515 --> 20:58.169
I mean, that's what I
keep telling myself.

20:58.213 --> 21:01.303
But then my mind goes to
the worst, and I think,

21:01.347 --> 21:04.350
David was this perfect
husband, but what if he wasn't?

21:04.393 --> 21:06.961
Karen, if there's
one thing I know,

21:07.004 --> 21:10.617
it's that David
loved you and Annie.

21:10.660 --> 21:13.054
There's got to be a good
explanation for this.

21:13.097 --> 21:14.055
Yeah, I know.

21:14.098 --> 21:15.317
I know.

21:15.361 --> 21:16.710
I'm telling you.

21:16.753 --> 21:20.627
I'm probably just not
thinking of something.

21:20.670 --> 21:22.455
We'll figure it out.

21:22.498 --> 21:23.673
Thank you, Neil.

21:23.717 --> 21:25.414
I appreciate you
coming over like this.

21:25.458 --> 21:26.023
Sure.

21:33.422 --> 21:36.991
[keys jingle]

21:37.034 --> 21:40.342
[drawer squeals]

21:40.386 --> 21:42.997
Annie, have you
been in my office?

21:43.040 --> 21:44.520
No.

21:44.564 --> 21:46.696
Well, then why is my
file cabinet unlocked?

21:46.740 --> 21:48.655
I don't know.

21:48.698 --> 21:51.222
Sweetheart, there's
important things in here

21:51.266 --> 21:53.007
that are private, and
it's not nice to go

21:53.050 --> 21:54.617
through people's stuff, OK?

21:54.661 --> 21:55.792
I didn't.

21:55.836 --> 21:57.620
Why would I look
through your files?

21:57.664 --> 21:58.621
I don't know.

21:58.665 --> 22:02.016
Just don't do it again, OK?

22:02.059 --> 22:03.017
[drawer slams]

22:03.060 --> 22:05.280
[groans]

22:13.636 --> 22:15.334
Hey, Barbara?

22:15.377 --> 22:16.378
Karen here.

22:16.422 --> 22:19.381
So I've got my 401[k].

22:19.425 --> 22:21.383
Yeah.

22:21.427 --> 22:23.385
Yeah, I'll fax it to you.

22:23.429 --> 22:24.386
OK.

22:24.430 --> 22:24.952
Thanks.

22:29.435 --> 22:32.960
[fast music]

22:42.448 --> 22:44.580
Oh my god!

22:44.624 --> 22:45.276
Karen!

22:45.320 --> 22:47.061
Molly!

22:47.104 --> 22:47.583
Oh!

22:47.627 --> 22:48.541
How are you?

22:48.584 --> 22:50.064
It's been forever.

22:50.107 --> 22:50.760
Oh.

22:53.459 --> 22:54.634
What are you doing here?

22:54.677 --> 22:56.375
I thought Joe got transferred.

22:56.418 --> 22:57.811
He just got transferred back.

22:57.854 --> 23:00.422
Yeah, we just came into
town a couple of days ago.

23:00.466 --> 23:01.728
This is so funny.

23:01.771 --> 23:02.859
I was going to call you.

23:02.903 --> 23:04.905
I just saw David this morning.

23:04.948 --> 23:06.689
I kept waving at
him, but he didn't--

23:09.300 --> 23:10.693
Karen?

23:10.737 --> 23:12.695
Karen, what's wrong?

23:12.739 --> 23:16.569
[cries]

23:16.612 --> 23:20.094
Do they know what
caused the crash?

23:20.137 --> 23:23.576
No, they're still
investigating.

23:23.619 --> 23:26.579
They found the pilot's
body, but David's--

23:26.622 --> 23:29.146
Karen, I am so sorry.

23:29.190 --> 23:30.191
I had no idea.

23:30.234 --> 23:30.670
No, no, no.

23:30.713 --> 23:31.453
It's OK.

23:31.497 --> 23:32.585
You didn't know.

23:32.628 --> 23:33.455
You were in the
middle of a move.

23:33.499 --> 23:35.457
You couldn't have known.

23:35.501 --> 23:39.026
Is there anything I can do?

23:39.069 --> 23:42.769
I mean, not unless you can
find his birth certificate.

23:42.812 --> 23:44.597
I couldn't find it in our files.

23:44.640 --> 23:47.295
I spent all morning on the
phone trying to track it down.

23:47.338 --> 23:49.645
Joe might still have a
friend or two in the Capital.

23:49.689 --> 23:51.430
I can ask him to make a call.

23:51.473 --> 23:52.300
Would you mind?

23:52.343 --> 23:53.040
Not at all.

23:53.083 --> 23:54.607
Anything to help out.

23:54.650 --> 23:56.435
But, you know, the truth is,
I'm more worried about Annie.

23:59.046 --> 24:02.005
I mean, things were already
tense before this happened.

24:02.049 --> 24:03.659
And, now, with David gone--

24:03.703 --> 24:04.965
You've lost your buffer?

24:05.008 --> 24:07.794
She really bounced
back after losing Jeff.

24:07.837 --> 24:09.709
She's doing well in school.

24:09.752 --> 24:11.319
She's got great friends.

24:11.362 --> 24:13.756
But it just feels like
everything could fall apart now

24:13.800 --> 24:15.845
if I say something
wrong, you know,

24:15.889 --> 24:17.804
or if I don't do
something that I should.

24:17.847 --> 24:19.458
Hey, hey.

24:19.501 --> 24:21.329
She's a good kid.

24:21.372 --> 24:23.331
You're a great mom.

24:23.374 --> 24:26.290
She might not be able to say
it, but she sees it, Karen.

24:26.334 --> 24:28.510
Oh my god, speaking
of Annie, I gotta go.

24:28.554 --> 24:29.685
I've gotta go home.

24:29.729 --> 24:31.644
Oh, I didn't realize
it was so late.

24:31.687 --> 24:33.428
I should get back to the hotel.

24:33.472 --> 24:34.821
Hotel?

24:34.864 --> 24:36.039
Yeah, we're having some
work done at the new house,

24:36.083 --> 24:37.606
so we're staying at the Heights.

24:37.650 --> 24:38.564
The Heights?

24:38.607 --> 24:39.913
Yeah, you know, downtown?

24:39.956 --> 24:42.002
That's where I thought I
saw David this morning.

24:42.045 --> 24:43.873
It was the weirdest thing.

24:43.917 --> 24:45.222
I would have sworn it was him.

24:47.747 --> 24:50.358
Is something wrong?

24:50.401 --> 24:51.054
No.

24:51.098 --> 24:53.883
Um, no.

24:53.927 --> 24:56.843
It was so good to see you.

24:56.886 --> 24:58.540
Call me if there's
anything you need.

24:58.584 --> 24:59.541
I will, I promise.

24:59.585 --> 25:00.542
OK.

25:00.586 --> 25:01.238
It was so good to see you.

25:01.282 --> 25:01.761
You too.

25:06.287 --> 25:09.159
Hey, I'm home.

25:09.203 --> 25:10.465
Hey.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.554
I thought you were gonna
to be home for dinner.

25:12.598 --> 25:14.121
Oh, I know.

25:14.164 --> 25:14.948
I'm sorry.

25:14.991 --> 25:17.864
I just lost track of time.

25:17.907 --> 25:18.647
Whatever.

25:18.691 --> 25:19.256
It's fine.

25:23.609 --> 25:26.481
[sighs]

25:26.525 --> 25:27.482
Why don't we order in?

25:27.526 --> 25:28.918
We can watch a movie.

25:28.962 --> 25:31.399
I already ate.

25:31.442 --> 25:32.443
Oh.

25:32.487 --> 25:36.230
Well, we can still
watch a movie.

25:36.273 --> 25:38.711
I'm just going to go to bed.

25:38.754 --> 25:39.712
Annie, wait.

25:39.755 --> 25:41.714
I want to spend time with you.

25:41.757 --> 25:43.150
I want to know how you're doing.

25:46.675 --> 25:48.721
I'm fine.

25:48.764 --> 25:51.332
I'm just tired.

25:51.375 --> 25:51.941
See you later.

25:54.727 --> 25:56.250
Good night.

25:56.293 --> 25:57.077
Good night.

26:02.952 --> 26:06.434
[phone ringing and buzzing]

26:09.916 --> 26:11.047
Hello?

26:11.091 --> 26:12.614
BARBARA [ON PHONE]: Karen, hi.

26:12.658 --> 26:15.922
I'm sorry to call you so late,
but the clock is ticking,

26:15.965 --> 26:18.533
and I really don't want
to wait until tomorrow.

26:18.577 --> 26:19.795
Oh, right.

26:19.839 --> 26:22.755
Did you get the 401[k]
that I sent over?

26:22.798 --> 26:24.800
I did.

26:24.844 --> 26:29.675
But, Karen, the
account is empty.

26:29.718 --> 26:31.154
What do you mean it's empty?

26:31.198 --> 26:35.942
Well, it looks like you
closed it out a few weeks ago.

26:35.985 --> 26:37.770
No, that's impossible.

26:37.813 --> 26:41.295
Well, it's not
just your 401[k].

26:41.338 --> 26:46.779
It's your money market
account, your CDs--

26:46.822 --> 26:48.781
Annie's 529.

26:48.824 --> 26:50.957
Her college money?

26:51.000 --> 26:55.048
You closed them all
over the past six months.

26:55.091 --> 26:58.486
Barbara, I didn't
close any accounts.

26:58.529 --> 27:00.357
Where's my money?

27:00.401 --> 27:03.970
Look, I've got our fraud
department looking into it.

27:04.013 --> 27:05.798
Are you telling me I'm broke?

27:05.841 --> 27:08.670
Well, no, not broke.

27:08.714 --> 27:12.805
With David's insurance-- he
had a double indemnity benefit

27:12.848 --> 27:14.981
in case of accidental death.

27:15.024 --> 27:16.504
How much was that again?

27:16.547 --> 27:17.723
Like, $300,000?

27:17.766 --> 27:20.508
No it's-- it's $3 million.

27:20.551 --> 27:21.770
$3 million?

27:21.814 --> 27:25.295
Now, I've talked to
the mortgage department,

27:25.339 --> 27:28.168
and with the incoming
money, they've

27:28.211 --> 27:31.824
agreed to give you another
extension while your claim is

27:31.867 --> 27:33.869
being processed this week.

27:33.913 --> 27:36.263
[sighs]

27:38.613 --> 27:40.049
Karen?

27:40.093 --> 27:41.660
Are you still there?

27:41.703 --> 27:44.445
Yeah.

27:44.488 --> 27:46.360
I'm here, Barbara.

27:46.403 --> 27:49.145
Look, we're
investigating on our end.

27:49.189 --> 27:52.018
My accounts-- how
could this have happened?

27:52.061 --> 27:57.066
It looks like you've
signed off on all of these

27:57.110 --> 27:58.764
before David filed them.

27:58.807 --> 27:59.939
David filed them?

27:59.982 --> 28:00.983
BARBARA [ON PHONE]:
I'll give you

28:01.027 --> 28:02.724
a call back when I know more.

28:02.768 --> 28:04.683
Is that OK?

28:04.726 --> 28:06.119
All right, thank you.

28:08.991 --> 28:13.082
[mysterious music]

28:48.596 --> 28:49.510
Hi.

28:49.553 --> 28:50.946
[clears throat]

28:50.990 --> 28:53.906
My husband stayed
here a while back,

28:53.949 --> 28:56.604
and I think he might
have left something--

28:56.647 --> 28:58.040
David Miller.

28:58.084 --> 28:59.999
I have the room key.

29:02.349 --> 29:05.613
Would you mind looking up that
reservation for me, please?

29:05.656 --> 29:08.616
I can't give you
that information.

29:08.659 --> 29:09.312
Right.

29:09.356 --> 29:09.965
OK.

29:12.881 --> 29:15.841
All right, thanks anyway.

29:15.884 --> 29:18.800
[mysterious music]

29:27.243 --> 29:30.812
Um, excuse me.

29:30.856 --> 29:32.379
What are you doing here?

29:32.422 --> 29:35.208
Um, my name is Karen Miller.

29:35.251 --> 29:40.822
I think you might have known
my husband, David Miller?

29:40.866 --> 29:42.215
David Miller?

29:42.258 --> 29:43.303
Yeah, I thought I did.

29:45.914 --> 29:47.437
Please just tell me the truth.

29:47.481 --> 29:51.964
Were you with him
here in this hotel?

29:52.007 --> 29:54.967
I found a room key.

29:55.010 --> 29:58.013
You really have
no idea, do you?

29:58.057 --> 29:59.972
No idea about what?

30:00.015 --> 30:02.235
Did you know him?

30:02.278 --> 30:03.932
I knew him like you did.

30:03.976 --> 30:05.107
What do you mean?

30:05.151 --> 30:08.328
It means not at all.

30:08.371 --> 30:10.504
Look, we can't talk here.

30:10.547 --> 30:11.244
Wait, why?

30:11.287 --> 30:12.723
I don't understand.

30:12.767 --> 30:14.725
Meet me in front of the
drugstore at Plymouth and Green

30:14.769 --> 30:16.466
at 3 o'clock.

30:16.510 --> 30:18.512
And make sure
you're not followed.

broke into the house.

Oh, Jesus.

Yes, hi, um, 9-1-1?

33:07.202 --> 33:08.334
Yeah.

33:08.377 --> 33:11.946
Uh, somebody broke
into my house.

33:11.990 --> 33:17.212
Yes, it's 14752 Chestnut Street.

Yeah, they came
through the front door.

glad you're safe.

[camera clicks]

33:49.636 --> 33:50.941
Are you OK, sweetheart?

33:54.075 --> 33:55.294
Do you want to talk about it?

33:57.687 --> 33:59.994
Look, I-- I really
appreciate your patience.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.865
I'm sorry this took so long.

34:01.909 --> 34:02.431
Annie?

34:04.912 --> 34:08.829
You said you didn't recognize
the intruder, is that correct?

34:08.871 --> 34:10.918
Like I said, he
was wearing a mask.

34:10.960 --> 34:12.224
OK.

34:12.266 --> 34:16.097
And you are 100%
sure it was a man?

34:16.141 --> 34:16.750
Good.

34:16.793 --> 34:18.012
Good.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.927
Now, could you tell
me anything about him?

34:19.969 --> 34:21.755
Was it-- was he tall?

34:21.797 --> 34:22.364
Was he short?

34:22.408 --> 34:23.148
Was he big?

34:23.190 --> 34:24.192
Was he small?

34:24.235 --> 34:26.237
I didn't get a very good look.

34:26.281 --> 34:28.762
I just turned and I ran.

34:28.804 --> 34:30.764
I'm sorry.

34:30.806 --> 34:31.982
Hey, hey, hey.

34:32.025 --> 34:33.766
You have nothing to
be sorry about, OK?

34:33.810 --> 34:34.985
No, no.

34:35.029 --> 34:36.117
You did what you had
to do to stay safe.

34:36.161 --> 34:37.205
That's what's important here.

34:37.248 --> 34:38.467
You did well, Annie.

34:41.208 --> 34:42.123
[sobs]

34:42.167 --> 34:43.864
What happens now?

34:43.907 --> 34:45.561
Well, we talked to
all the neighbors,

34:45.605 --> 34:47.781
and nobody saw anything
out of the ordinary.

34:47.824 --> 34:50.349
We'll dust everything
for prints.

34:50.391 --> 34:51.958
We'll try and find
some surveillance video

34:52.002 --> 34:54.440
cameras that maybe captured
a vehicle coming in or out.

34:54.483 --> 34:56.616
But other than that, with
what we have right now,

34:56.659 --> 34:58.139
that's pretty much
all we can do.

34:58.183 --> 34:59.706
That's it?

34:59.749 --> 35:03.144
This guy broke into our house
and he's still out there.

35:03.188 --> 35:04.189
It's OK.

35:04.232 --> 35:05.625
It's OK.

35:05.668 --> 35:08.280
We could still use a little
more help from you, OK?

35:08.323 --> 35:10.630
If you remember
anything, anything else

35:10.673 --> 35:12.980
about this intruder,
even if it's this small,

35:13.023 --> 35:14.764
and you think it'll
be irrelevant,

35:14.808 --> 35:17.637
you promise you'll
call and tell me, OK?

35:17.680 --> 35:18.246
OK.

35:18.290 --> 35:19.508
All right.

35:19.552 --> 35:21.815
Can I talk to you
privately for a second?

35:21.858 --> 35:23.338
Mom?

35:23.382 --> 35:24.339
No, no, no, no, no.

35:24.383 --> 35:25.862
It's OK.

35:25.906 --> 35:27.386
I'm just going to talk to
the detective [inaudible]..

35:27.429 --> 35:29.649
I just want to talk to
your mom for one second.

35:29.692 --> 35:31.912
The filing cabinet--

35:31.955 --> 35:34.001
he was going through
the filing cabinet

35:34.044 --> 35:36.482
like he was looking
for something.

35:36.525 --> 35:37.831
Does that help?

35:37.874 --> 35:38.484
Yes.

35:38.527 --> 35:40.050
Yes, it might.

35:40.094 --> 35:41.008
Thank you, Annie.

35:41.051 --> 35:42.401
That was very good.

35:42.444 --> 35:44.229
You've been very brave
through this whole thing.

35:44.272 --> 35:48.450
You should be proud
of yourself, OK?

35:48.494 --> 35:50.844
Look, I don't want
to upset her any more,

35:50.887 --> 35:54.021
but I have to ask you
a very direct question.

35:54.064 --> 35:57.198
Do you think you know who
broke into your house?

35:57.242 --> 35:58.112
No.

35:58.156 --> 35:59.505
Why would you ask that?

35:59.548 --> 36:01.855
Because it was a robbery
and nothing was stolen--

36:01.898 --> 36:05.206
no cash, no jewelry,
no electronics.

36:05.250 --> 36:06.686
Right?

36:06.729 --> 36:08.166
And when that happens, it's
usually one of two things.

36:08.209 --> 36:09.515
It's either insurance fraud--

36:09.558 --> 36:10.951
Detective?

36:10.994 --> 36:15.085
--or they're looking for
something very specific.

36:15.129 --> 36:18.393
So I want you to think, and
I'm going to ask you again.

36:18.437 --> 36:23.398
Who broke into this house and
what would they be looking for?

36:23.442 --> 36:26.880
I don't know.

36:26.923 --> 36:28.360
OK.

36:28.403 --> 36:31.058
Well, judging from the
condition they left this place,

36:31.101 --> 36:33.713
you have something
that these people want.

36:33.756 --> 36:35.889
And if they didn't get it
this time, I'm telling you,

36:35.932 --> 36:36.890
they're going to come back.

36:36.933 --> 36:37.717
[phone rings]

36:37.760 --> 36:39.284
Excuse me for one second.

36:41.503 --> 36:42.374
Uh, yeah.

36:42.417 --> 36:43.636
Detective [inaudible]?

36:43.679 --> 36:44.550
Where are you?

36:44.593 --> 36:46.508
It's OK, sweetheart.

36:46.552 --> 36:47.248
Yes.

36:47.292 --> 36:47.944
Yeah.

36:47.988 --> 36:49.163
OK, OK.

36:49.207 --> 36:49.772
Excuse me.

36:53.472 --> 36:54.908
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

37:00.957 --> 37:03.308
I got here as soon as I could.

37:03.351 --> 37:04.396
Are you OK?

37:04.439 --> 37:05.875
Yeah.

37:05.919 --> 37:08.791
No, just-- you know, we're
just a little bit shaken.

37:08.835 --> 37:11.620
But-- but we're good.

37:11.664 --> 37:14.101
Thank you for coming.

37:14.144 --> 37:17.147
I just-- I don't want
to be alone right now,

37:17.191 --> 37:19.280
especially with everything
that's happened.

37:19.324 --> 37:20.150
I'm glad you called.

37:23.110 --> 37:24.677
How's Annie?

37:24.720 --> 37:25.808
She's freaked out.

37:25.852 --> 37:27.723
She's staying with
friends tonight.

37:27.767 --> 37:30.639
I didn't want her home while
the police are investigating.

37:30.683 --> 37:32.075
How are you holding up?

37:32.119 --> 37:32.685
I'm OK.

37:34.991 --> 37:38.299
I just think she was home
alone with an intruder.

37:38.343 --> 37:40.432
I mean, thank god she's OK.

37:40.475 --> 37:42.782
You're gonna get through this.

37:42.825 --> 37:44.653
First things first, OK?

37:44.697 --> 37:45.915
Did they take anything?

37:45.959 --> 37:48.004
No, it doesn't
look like they did.

37:48.048 --> 37:51.617
But the detective said
that they were probably

37:51.660 --> 37:54.184
looking for something specific.

37:54.228 --> 37:55.273
Like what?

37:55.316 --> 37:56.578
I don't know.

37:56.622 --> 38:01.017
I keep thinking over and
over again, you know?

38:01.061 --> 38:01.931
I don't know.

38:01.975 --> 38:04.107
I don't understand any of it.

38:04.151 --> 38:05.587
Tell me about
this woman again.

38:05.631 --> 38:07.328
She-- she-- she just
never showed up?

38:07.372 --> 38:08.373
No.

38:08.416 --> 38:10.070
And it was the weirdest thing.

38:10.113 --> 38:13.813
The way she looked at me,
it was like she saw a ghost.

38:13.856 --> 38:18.339
And-- and you don't know
how they knew each other?

38:18.383 --> 38:19.906
[sighs]

38:19.949 --> 38:21.124
No.

38:21.168 --> 38:22.735
Between that and the
call from the bank,

38:22.778 --> 38:24.389
I almost had a heart attack.

38:24.432 --> 38:27.000
And then Barbara calls and tells
me about the life insurance.

38:27.043 --> 38:28.567
I did have a heart attack.

38:28.610 --> 38:32.135
And meanwhile, I still can't
find his birth certificate.

38:32.179 --> 38:36.662
I mean, it just
seems like he's--

38:36.705 --> 38:38.098
I don't know.

38:38.141 --> 38:39.708
Like he's what?

38:39.752 --> 38:40.405
I don't know.

38:40.448 --> 38:41.928
Nothing.

38:41.971 --> 38:44.496
Nothing.

38:44.539 --> 38:49.979
Well, at least he had the
foresight to take out a policy.

38:50.023 --> 38:54.288
And you and Annie are
gonna be taken care of.

38:54.332 --> 38:57.030
Yeah.

38:57.073 --> 38:58.684
Yeah.

38:58.727 --> 38:59.685
You're gonna be good.

38:59.728 --> 39:03.210
[ominous music]

39:26.233 --> 39:29.105
[knocking]

39:33.022 --> 39:34.241
Hello, Mrs. Miller.

39:34.284 --> 39:34.981
Hey, detective.

39:35.024 --> 39:35.895
I'm glad I caught you.

39:35.938 --> 39:37.418
Can give me a minute?

39:37.462 --> 39:38.158
Sure.

39:38.201 --> 39:38.680
Come on in.

39:38.724 --> 39:39.246
Thank you.

39:43.772 --> 39:45.165
Uh, would you
like to have a seat?

39:45.208 --> 39:45.731
No.

39:45.774 --> 39:46.427
No, thank you.

39:46.471 --> 39:47.123
I'm fine.

39:47.167 --> 39:47.602
I'm fine.

39:47.646 --> 39:48.211
Thank you.

39:48.255 --> 39:49.038
OK.

39:49.082 --> 39:50.997
Um, so do you have a lead?

39:51.040 --> 39:53.347
Well, I'm sorry, Mrs.
Miller, but I'm actually here

39:53.391 --> 39:54.653
on another matter.

39:54.696 --> 39:55.349
Oh.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.306
OK.

39:56.350 --> 39:57.482
What is it?

39:57.525 --> 40:00.876
I have to ask you
about Jessica Reid.

40:00.920 --> 40:02.487
I'm sorry, who?

40:02.530 --> 40:04.445
Jessica Reid.

40:04.489 --> 40:05.838
How do you know her?

40:05.881 --> 40:07.013
Oh, I don't.

40:07.056 --> 40:08.362
I don't know a Jessica Reid.

40:08.406 --> 40:09.450
You don't?

40:09.494 --> 40:11.409
You sure?

40:11.452 --> 40:13.019
Yeah.

40:13.062 --> 40:15.021
Because you were seen talking
to her yesterday in the lobby

40:15.064 --> 40:17.327
of the Heights Hotel downtown.

40:17.371 --> 40:19.939
We have surveillance footage
from the security camera,

40:19.982 --> 40:25.248
so do you still say you
don't know Jessica Reid?

40:25.292 --> 40:26.554
No.

40:26.598 --> 40:28.077
I only met her briefly,
but I don't know her.

40:28.121 --> 40:29.862
Mm-hm.

40:29.905 --> 40:31.646
Why are you
asking me about her?

40:31.690 --> 40:34.693
Jessica Reid was found
dead in her car this morning.

40:34.736 --> 40:37.217
[scary music]

40:38.653 --> 40:41.526
Oh my god.

40:41.569 --> 40:46.487
I, um-- no, I don't know her.

40:46.531 --> 40:49.403
I-- I think she might
have known my husband?

40:49.447 --> 40:50.622
Really?

40:50.665 --> 40:52.711
How?

40:52.754 --> 40:53.842
Oh, I don't know.

40:53.886 --> 40:56.932
Oh, I, um-- there was a picture.

40:56.976 --> 41:00.675
I had a picture, but I
seem to have misplaced it.

41:00.719 --> 41:02.416
You misplaced it.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.505
Maybe-- maybe he took it.

41:04.549 --> 41:05.767
Your husband?

41:05.811 --> 41:06.594
No.

41:06.638 --> 41:07.377
My husband's dead.

41:10.772 --> 41:13.732
Maybe whoever broke
in here took it.

41:13.775 --> 41:15.908
So let me get this straight.

41:15.951 --> 41:16.952
They broke in.

41:16.996 --> 41:18.563
They ransacked your whole house.

41:18.606 --> 41:23.568
They terrorized your daughter
to get a photo of your husband?

41:23.611 --> 41:24.960
Yeah.

41:25.004 --> 41:25.874
I don't know.

41:25.918 --> 41:26.875
You're the detective.

41:26.919 --> 41:28.355
I'm hoping you can tell me.

41:31.924 --> 41:32.925
Who was she?

41:32.968 --> 41:34.666
We don't know.

41:34.709 --> 41:36.581
We only have a name
from the hotel.

41:36.624 --> 41:37.843
She paid in cash.

41:37.886 --> 41:40.236
She didn't leave
any ID on record.

41:40.280 --> 41:41.934
We're trying to figure
out who she was.

41:41.977 --> 41:45.372
Actually, I was hoping you'd
be able to help us out.

41:45.415 --> 41:46.373
Yeah, I--

41:46.416 --> 41:47.983
I don't know.

41:48.027 --> 41:50.551
Yesterday, I-- I happened to
see her at the Heights Hotel,

41:50.595 --> 41:53.467
but I didn't get a chance to
ask her how she knew my husband.

41:53.511 --> 41:54.250
That's convenient.

41:56.862 --> 41:59.386
Well, it's the truth.

41:59.429 --> 42:01.127
OK.

42:01.170 --> 42:05.871
So why were you at the
Heights Hotel yesterday?

42:05.914 --> 42:08.569
[sighs]

42:08.613 --> 42:15.141
The morning that my
husband died, there was, um--

42:15.184 --> 42:17.883
I found a card key
in his suit pocket.

42:17.926 --> 42:19.319
Mm-hm.

42:19.362 --> 42:21.974
So I just--

42:22.017 --> 42:24.498
he told me that he had a
conference there last year,

42:24.542 --> 42:25.368
so I--

42:25.412 --> 42:28.458
But you didn't believe him.

42:28.502 --> 42:29.459
I don't know.

42:29.503 --> 42:30.025
I know.

42:30.069 --> 42:31.549
I don't know.

42:31.592 --> 42:35.509
I don't-- I don't really
know what to believe anymore.

42:35.553 --> 42:38.817
Mrs. Miller, it was
brought to my attention

42:38.860 --> 42:42.821
that you took out a very large
life insurance policy right

42:42.864 --> 42:44.518
before your husband died.

42:44.562 --> 42:45.388
Is that true?

42:45.432 --> 42:46.041
No.

42:46.085 --> 42:47.173
He took that out.

42:47.216 --> 42:48.957
I didn't know
anything about that.

42:49.001 --> 42:52.657
But you are the
beneficiary, right?

42:52.700 --> 42:54.659
What are you implying?

42:54.702 --> 42:57.400
I'm not implying anything--

42:57.444 --> 42:58.880
yet.

42:58.924 --> 43:02.014
I'm just asking questions
and gathering information.

43:02.057 --> 43:04.146
Well, I'm sorry.

43:04.190 --> 43:06.105
I-- I don't have
any answers for you.

43:09.891 --> 43:10.849
Thanks for your time.

43:10.892 --> 43:11.937
Here, let me get the door.

43:11.980 --> 43:12.851
No, no, no.

43:12.894 --> 43:13.982
I'll see myself out.

43:14.026 --> 43:14.809
Thank you.

43:14.853 --> 43:17.029
OK.

43:17.072 --> 43:19.292
[detective sighs]

43:19.335 --> 43:22.121
Mrs. Miller, if you
plan on leaving town,

43:22.164 --> 43:24.602
you need to let us
know in advance, OK?

43:24.645 --> 43:27.953
Because there are going to be
a lot more questions, and, um,

43:27.996 --> 43:29.868
I think you need to
have better answers.

43:29.911 --> 43:33.393
[ominous music]

43:53.065 --> 43:54.675
Mom?

43:54.719 --> 43:55.981
Are you OK?

43:56.024 --> 43:59.158
I'm fine, sweetheart.

43:59.201 --> 44:00.072
Are you sure?

44:03.553 --> 44:04.250
Yeah, I'm fine.

44:07.601 --> 44:09.908
How are you holding up?

44:09.951 --> 44:11.605
I don't know.

44:11.649 --> 44:18.438
I just-- I keep
wishing David was here.

44:18.481 --> 44:19.047
I know.

44:22.311 --> 44:25.837
I keep thinking maybe if
he was here, none of this

44:25.880 --> 44:26.664
would have happened.

44:30.929 --> 44:32.626
Mom?

44:32.670 --> 44:33.932
What's wrong?

44:33.975 --> 44:35.760
[breathes in sharply]

44:35.803 --> 44:36.935
Nothing.

44:36.978 --> 44:38.763
Mom, it's obviously
not nothing.

44:38.806 --> 44:39.459
Tell me.

44:43.071 --> 44:45.030
Did David ever talk
to you about a woman

44:45.073 --> 44:47.772
named Jessica Reid?

44:47.815 --> 44:50.296
Who?

44:50.339 --> 44:51.732
The police came
here last night

44:51.776 --> 44:55.780
asking questions about
this woman that David knew.

44:55.823 --> 44:56.563
She died yesterday.

44:59.522 --> 45:01.220
Why are they
asking you about it?

45:05.354 --> 45:08.140
David might have been
involved in some things

45:08.183 --> 45:10.272
that we didn't know about.

45:10.316 --> 45:11.360
What kind of things?

45:14.320 --> 45:18.150
Well, it's-- it's complicated.

45:18.193 --> 45:21.327
There's money missing,
and this woman.

45:21.370 --> 45:23.024
But it's nothing for
you to worry about.

45:23.068 --> 45:25.810
How could you talk
about David like that?

45:25.853 --> 45:27.246
He was our family.

45:27.289 --> 45:29.552
He's gone, and you're
just tearing him down.

45:29.596 --> 45:30.466
No, no, no, no.

45:30.510 --> 45:32.468
It's not-- it's not like that.

45:32.512 --> 45:36.864
No, first of all, David
loved you very much.

45:36.908 --> 45:38.300
It's just-- there's
these questions,

45:38.344 --> 45:40.999
and I'm just trying
to be honest with you.

45:41.042 --> 45:42.261
I don't want to hear about it.

45:42.304 --> 45:43.479
I'm going to school.

45:43.523 --> 45:45.525
Are you sure you're
ready to go back?

45:45.568 --> 45:46.961
So soon?

45:47.005 --> 45:48.223
After everything?

45:48.267 --> 45:50.573
Well, it's safer
there than it is here.

45:50.617 --> 45:51.139
Bye

45:51.183 --> 45:51.836
Please, Annie.

45:51.879 --> 45:52.401
Good bye.

45:56.057 --> 45:59.104
[huffs]

46:00.409 --> 46:03.891
[phone ringing and vibrating]

46:08.243 --> 46:08.853
Hey, Molly.

46:08.896 --> 46:10.202
What's up?

46:10.245 --> 46:11.943
MOLLY [ON PHONE]: To be
honest, I'm not sure.

46:11.986 --> 46:13.379
I had Joe check
in with his friend

46:13.422 --> 46:15.294
at Vital Records about
David's birth certificate.

46:15.337 --> 46:16.469
Oh, good.

46:16.512 --> 46:17.775
Thank you.
I've been waiting for that.

46:17.818 --> 46:19.211
They couldn't find it.

46:20.603 --> 46:22.518
What do you mean
they couldn't find it?

46:22.562 --> 46:26.218
They have no record of a David
Miller with that birth date.

46:26.261 --> 46:28.133
OK, well, there
must be some mistake.

46:28.176 --> 46:29.525
That's what we thought.

46:29.569 --> 46:31.179
Joe asked them to conduct
a nationwide search.

46:31.223 --> 46:33.791
And they did find a David Miller
with your husband's birth date

46:33.834 --> 46:37.969
and social security
number from North Dakota.

46:38.012 --> 46:39.492
OK, well, maybe he's from--

46:39.535 --> 46:41.276
MOLLY [ON PHONE]: Karen--

46:41.320 --> 46:44.236
he died five years ago.

46:44.279 --> 46:45.193
What do you mean?

46:45.237 --> 46:46.238
MOLLY [ON PHONE]: David--

46:46.281 --> 46:47.500
he wasn't who he said he was.

46:52.113 --> 46:52.679
David?

46:55.856 --> 46:57.031
OK.

46:57.075 --> 46:58.250
I don't understand
what you're saying.

46:58.293 --> 46:59.773
Your husband had
a stolen identity.

46:59.817 --> 47:01.731
The man you married
wasn't David Miller.

47:06.824 --> 47:08.129
Karen?

47:08.173 --> 47:10.479
Are you still there?

47:10.523 --> 47:11.002
Yeah.

47:13.874 --> 47:15.833
Molly?

47:15.876 --> 47:18.923
If my husband wasn't David
Miller, then who was he?

47:21.926 --> 47:24.189
David!

47:24.232 --> 47:26.278
I thought you were dead.

47:26.321 --> 47:27.453
How are you--

47:27.496 --> 47:30.456
Yeah, Annie,
Annie, I'm so sorry.

47:30.499 --> 47:32.284
There's been a terrible
mistake, and I--

47:32.327 --> 47:33.676
I want to explain
everything to you,

47:33.720 --> 47:36.636
but you need to come
with you right away.

47:36.679 --> 47:38.681
You, your mother, and
I, we're all in danger.

47:41.554 --> 47:42.772
What do you mean, danger?

47:42.816 --> 47:44.078
Hey, listen.

47:44.122 --> 47:45.079
I'll explain as soon as
I can, but right now I

47:45.123 --> 47:45.993
need to do everything I say.

47:46.037 --> 47:47.299
Can you do that for me?

47:47.342 --> 47:48.300
Of course.

47:48.343 --> 47:50.302
Good girl.

47:50.345 --> 47:51.303
OK, come on.

47:51.346 --> 47:52.478
We don't have much time.

47:52.521 --> 47:53.914
OK.

47:53.958 --> 47:55.133
MOLLY [ON PHONE]: There's more.

47:55.176 --> 47:56.656
Joe did some digging.

47:56.699 --> 47:58.484
KAREN [ON PHONE]:
What did he-- what?

47:58.527 --> 47:59.615
Tell me.

47:59.659 --> 48:01.313
Karen, I don't
know how to say this,

48:01.356 --> 48:04.229
but he thinks that David
might have had another wife.

48:04.272 --> 48:05.665
There's a woman named Jessica.

48:05.708 --> 48:07.014
Jessica Reid?

48:07.058 --> 48:09.408
How did you know?

48:09.451 --> 48:11.453
Jessica Reid was here in town.

48:11.497 --> 48:14.326
We think she might have
tracked David down.

48:14.369 --> 48:18.112
Molly, are you saying
David's still alive?

48:18.156 --> 48:19.418
I don't know.

48:19.461 --> 48:21.289
But if he is, he might
try to contact you.

48:21.333 --> 48:22.334
Oh my god, Annie.

48:22.377 --> 48:23.422
MOLLY [ON PHONE]: Or--

48:23.465 --> 48:25.772
I have to go.

48:25.815 --> 48:26.381
Oh my god.

48:30.995 --> 48:31.865
Yeah.

48:31.909 --> 48:33.867
Rebecca, is she there?

48:33.911 --> 48:34.955
No.

48:34.999 --> 48:36.957
No, she's not
answering her phone.

48:37.001 --> 48:38.306
I know.

48:38.350 --> 48:40.743
Becca, will you please
tell me if she shows up?

48:40.787 --> 48:42.528
All right.

48:42.571 --> 48:44.182
OK.

48:44.225 --> 48:44.878
Oh my god.

48:52.930 --> 48:54.714
Oh my god!

48:54.757 --> 48:56.890
Annie?

48:56.934 --> 48:58.718
Annie!

48:58.761 --> 48:59.327
Annie!

49:08.597 --> 49:09.859
Yes.

49:09.903 --> 49:12.862
Hi, this is Karen Miller
for Detective Baldwin.

49:12.906 --> 49:13.733
It's an emergency.

49:13.776 --> 49:14.342
Can you--

49:16.997 --> 49:19.913
[huffs]

49:19.957 --> 49:20.914
Oh!

49:20.958 --> 49:21.610
Annie!

49:21.654 --> 49:23.438
Thank god you're OK.

49:23.482 --> 49:27.616
Karen, it's me.

49:27.660 --> 49:28.139
David?

49:30.706 --> 49:32.534
Let's not do this
over the phone, Karen.

49:32.578 --> 49:34.928
Meet me at the house.

49:34.972 --> 49:36.321
David, where's Annie?

49:36.364 --> 49:40.499
She's safe-- for now.

49:40.542 --> 49:42.283
Come home, and
she'll stay that way.

49:42.327 --> 49:44.590
David, I need to
know that she's OK.

49:44.633 --> 49:48.942
Come to the house, Karen.

49:48.986 --> 49:53.207
Oh, and, uh, let's not
involve the police.

49:53.251 --> 49:54.556
Yeah?

49:54.600 --> 49:58.343
You wouldn't want this
to get ugly, would you?

49:58.386 --> 50:00.867
[breathes heavily]

50:00.910 --> 50:04.566
[phone rings]

50:04.610 --> 50:06.046
Mrs. Miller, is everything OK?

50:06.090 --> 50:08.222
I got a message you called
about your daughter.

50:08.266 --> 50:09.354
Yes, detective.

50:09.397 --> 50:10.181
You know what?

50:10.224 --> 50:11.138
Everything's fine.

50:11.182 --> 50:13.445
I just-- I made a mistake.

50:13.488 --> 50:14.794
A mistake?

50:14.837 --> 50:16.361
I was told you
said it was urgent.

50:16.404 --> 50:17.188
No, no.

50:17.231 --> 50:18.102
I-- I'm so sorry.

50:18.145 --> 50:19.842
I-- I made a mistake.

50:19.886 --> 50:22.019
Look, I could
come by your house.

50:22.062 --> 50:23.324
No, no, no.

50:23.368 --> 50:25.674
Please-- please-- please
don't come by the house.

50:25.718 --> 50:26.893
OK.

50:26.936 --> 50:27.981
OK.

50:28.025 --> 50:28.634
OK.

50:28.677 --> 50:30.462
Thank you so much.

50:30.505 --> 50:31.071
Thank you.

50:35.119 --> 50:38.600
[fast music]

50:41.081 --> 50:42.430
Annie?

50:42.474 --> 50:45.868
She's not here.

50:45.912 --> 50:47.087
David.

50:47.131 --> 50:50.134
Hello, Karen.

50:50.177 --> 50:53.876
You're-- where's Annie?

50:53.920 --> 50:54.616
Oh, come on.

50:54.660 --> 50:55.574
We'll get to all that.

50:55.617 --> 50:57.010
How have you been?

50:57.054 --> 50:58.055
I've really missed you.

51:01.797 --> 51:03.321
David, I don't understand.

51:03.364 --> 51:06.498
Honey, I will
explain everything.

51:06.541 --> 51:09.892
But, first, we have just
a little bit of business

51:09.936 --> 51:11.807
to attend to.

51:11.851 --> 51:15.376
You have something,
and it belongs to me.

51:15.420 --> 51:17.552
What are you talking about?

51:17.596 --> 51:18.336
Where's Annie?

51:18.379 --> 51:19.119
Karen!

51:19.163 --> 51:20.425
Shh.

51:20.468 --> 51:22.470
You're not listening.

51:22.514 --> 51:24.168
I have her.

51:24.211 --> 51:24.820
She is safe.

51:27.127 --> 51:29.869
Now, whether or not she
stays that way, I mean,

51:29.912 --> 51:32.219
that's-- that's kinda
gonna be up to you, babe.

51:32.263 --> 51:34.613
You lied.

51:34.656 --> 51:37.529
You took everything from us--

51:37.572 --> 51:40.706
the house, the retirement.

51:40.749 --> 51:44.057
How could you do that to us?

51:44.101 --> 51:45.232
I mean, what?

51:45.276 --> 51:47.365
Fake my own death?

51:47.408 --> 51:48.583
It's not rocket science.

51:48.627 --> 51:50.150
Those little planes
aren't very safe.

51:50.194 --> 51:51.673
They go down all the time.

51:51.717 --> 51:53.545
Nobody takes special note
if one more crashes, right?

51:53.588 --> 51:54.807
Yeah, but you were on it.

51:58.202 --> 51:59.203
Apparently not.

51:59.246 --> 52:00.465
[laughs]

52:00.508 --> 52:02.119
No, I had a last
second change of plans,

52:02.162 --> 52:04.556
so they didn't even have time
to update the passenger manifest

52:04.599 --> 52:05.644
before they left.

52:05.687 --> 52:08.429
David, where's Annie?

52:08.473 --> 52:10.953
Tell me where she is or I'm
calling the police right now.

52:10.997 --> 52:12.607
Then you'll never
see her again.

52:14.740 --> 52:18.222
What do you want?

52:18.265 --> 52:24.097
Before I took off for Seattle,
I seem to have [clears throat]

52:24.141 --> 52:29.320
misplaced some fairly
important account numbers,

52:29.363 --> 52:31.713
and I can't get to my money.

52:31.757 --> 52:35.108
You were the one
that broke in here.

52:35.152 --> 52:38.024
You trashed the place.

52:38.067 --> 52:39.852
You're looking for
account information.

52:39.895 --> 52:41.593
And they appear to be gone.

52:41.636 --> 52:43.638
Now, as you can imagine,
it's not exactly easy

52:43.682 --> 52:45.814
for me to head on down to
the bank and clear this up,

52:45.858 --> 52:49.035
but there's good news.

52:49.078 --> 52:52.169
You have a very large sum
of money coming in today.

52:52.212 --> 52:53.213
I will take it.

52:53.257 --> 52:55.433
David, you've already taken--

52:55.476 --> 52:56.173
I can't-- I--

52:56.216 --> 52:56.869
Karen!

52:56.912 --> 52:58.958
Shh.

52:59.001 --> 53:01.613
You know I don't like to argue.

53:01.656 --> 53:03.136
This is very simple.

53:03.180 --> 53:04.790
Go see Barbara.

53:04.833 --> 53:07.184
Tell her you want the
cash, and I will tell you

53:07.227 --> 53:08.533
where to bring it, OK?

53:08.576 --> 53:09.882
No.

53:09.925 --> 53:12.276
I'm not doing it until
you give me back Annie.

53:12.319 --> 53:17.063
[squeals]

53:17.106 --> 53:21.459
You don't seem to, uh,
understand your situation here,

53:21.502 --> 53:27.029
Karen, so let's try again.

53:27.073 --> 53:30.250
I have your baby.

53:30.294 --> 53:31.208
I have her.

53:34.080 --> 53:41.827
Now, if you get me my money,
you will get her back unharmed.

53:41.870 --> 53:50.096
But if you don't, you have
no idea what I'm capable of.

53:53.273 --> 53:55.536
Be smart, honey.

53:56.624 --> 53:57.843
Annie's counting on you.

54:01.325 --> 54:04.153
[sobs]

54:15.077 --> 54:16.078
Hey.

54:16.122 --> 54:17.341
Where were you?

54:17.384 --> 54:18.167
Where's my mom?

54:18.211 --> 54:18.820
It's OK.

54:18.864 --> 54:19.517
Annie, come here.

54:19.560 --> 54:20.605
Sit with me.

54:20.648 --> 54:22.868
Sweetie, listen.

54:22.911 --> 54:25.131
Your mom is fine, OK?

54:25.174 --> 54:27.699
And she's going to be
here real soon, I promise.

54:27.742 --> 54:29.875
Can I call her?

54:29.918 --> 54:31.659
Sweetie, I'm sorry.

54:31.703 --> 54:34.227
It's just not safe yet.

54:34.271 --> 54:36.055
Why aren't you telling
me what's going on?

54:36.098 --> 54:39.058
Look, Annie, I
know this sucks.

54:39.101 --> 54:41.930
Believe me, I hate
this more than you do.

54:41.974 --> 54:45.020
Thank god, I so want to just
tell you everything, you know,

54:45.064 --> 54:45.673
but--

54:49.068 --> 54:52.071
but your mom, she's
going to be here soon,

54:52.114 --> 54:55.379
and we will explain
it together, OK?

54:55.422 --> 54:56.945
It's just how it has to be.

54:56.989 --> 54:58.904
Can I at least
have my phone back?

54:58.947 --> 54:59.426
Annie.

55:02.516 --> 55:04.475
Don't you trust me?

55:04.518 --> 55:07.608
Of course I do.

55:07.652 --> 55:09.393
That's a good girl.

55:09.436 --> 55:17.052
Now, in the meantime, I
got us some Thai food.

55:17.096 --> 55:18.663
Annie?

55:18.706 --> 55:20.142
Yeah, that's great.

55:20.186 --> 55:22.101
Good.

55:22.144 --> 55:23.102
OK.

55:23.145 --> 55:24.016
That's yours.

55:27.454 --> 55:28.368
Hi, Barbara.

55:28.412 --> 55:29.761
Karen, hi.

55:29.804 --> 55:30.762
I was going to call you.

55:30.805 --> 55:32.111
Please, have a seat.

55:32.154 --> 55:33.373
Thanks.

55:33.417 --> 55:35.288
I'm-- um, I'm here about
the life insurance.

55:35.332 --> 55:37.246
I-- um, I know that
the payout is today,

55:37.290 --> 55:40.685
but I'd like to
cash it out please.

55:40.728 --> 55:43.296
Karen, I hate to be the
bearer of more bad news,

55:43.340 --> 55:48.301
but your insurer is
denying your claim.

55:48.345 --> 55:50.259
What?

55:50.303 --> 55:54.046
They found some irregularities
in David's background,

55:54.089 --> 55:56.657
and they've opened a
formal investigation.

55:56.701 --> 55:58.137
Now, we can appeal--

55:58.180 --> 55:59.051
No, no, no.

55:59.094 --> 56:00.618
Barbara, I need that money now--

56:00.661 --> 56:01.923
today.

56:01.967 --> 56:02.968
I know you're behind
on your mortgage.

56:03.011 --> 56:04.056
No, it's not about--

56:08.887 --> 56:13.021
um, what are my assets
as of right now?

56:13.065 --> 56:14.980
Between your checking
and your savings?

56:28.254 --> 56:29.560
That's it?

56:29.603 --> 56:30.778
I'm sorry, Karen.

56:30.822 --> 56:31.518
That's everything.

56:36.436 --> 56:38.569
OK, please give it to me.

56:38.612 --> 56:41.354
You want to close
out your accounts?

56:41.398 --> 56:45.489
Karen, I really strongly
suggest you don't do that.

56:45.532 --> 56:48.492

She's here.

KAREN [ON PHONE]: I
wanna talk to her.

I will text you the address--

you scared me.

You didn't answer.

Right now is just not
really a good time.

58:18.799 --> 58:19.757
We need to talk.

58:19.800 --> 58:20.932
Neil, I can't talk right now.

58:20.975 --> 58:22.934
Karen, what's going on?

58:22.977 --> 58:24.457
I got a tip at work.

58:24.501 --> 58:27.112
The police are opening an
investigation into David.

58:27.155 --> 58:29.941
OK, look, promise me you won't
run the story until you and I

58:29.984 --> 58:31.116
have had a chance to talk, OK?

58:31.159 --> 58:32.813
You have a chance to talk now.

58:32.857 --> 58:33.945
Neil, I can't talk now.

I'm so sorry.

really have to go.

I'll call you later, OK?

Oh.

58:50.875 --> 58:51.919
Hey there, sleepyhead.

OK, so I need to take off
for just a couple hours,

I'll try again.

taken her, and there's just--

as a bargaining chip.

call the police.

track her phone.

lot, and I tried to trick him.

and I don't want

to risk anything, Neil, OK?

that can investigate, right?

this.

apologize to you for yesterday.

I think I might've
been a little hasty.

Would it be OK if I
reopen my accounts?

Of course you can.

you with that out front.

you would help me, Barbara.

[knocking]

01:08:19.486 --> 01:08:20.487
Detective.

01:08:20.531 --> 01:08:22.054
Mrs. Miller.

01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:23.707
Um, now's not
really a good time.

01:08:23.751 --> 01:08:25.404
Well, I'm sorry
about that, but I need

01:08:25.448 --> 01:08:27.059
to ask you a few questions.

01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:29.496
Please, I don't know anything
more about Jessica Reid.

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:31.063
Well, it's not
about Jessica Reid,

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:34.197
although it might be
related to Jessica Reid.

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:36.328
A detective at my
precinct got a call today

01:08:36.372 --> 01:08:38.505
from a Barbara Waldron.

01:08:38.549 --> 01:08:40.594
You're being investigated
for bank fraud.

01:08:40.638 --> 01:08:42.073
It's some sort of
misunderstanding.

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:43.944
Well, maybe there is a
misunderstanding, but please,

01:08:43.988 --> 01:08:46.122
you need to come with
me down to the precinct.

01:08:46.165 --> 01:08:47.078
We need to talk about this.

01:08:47.122 --> 01:08:47.993
Today is not good.

01:08:48.036 --> 01:08:49.908
I-- I-- I can't leave the house.

01:08:49.951 --> 01:08:52.823
I'm asking you
politely as a courtesy.

01:08:52.867 --> 01:08:55.913
You need to come with
me to the precinct.

01:08:55.957 --> 01:08:57.394
OK, I, um--

01:08:57.437 --> 01:08:58.308
I have to use the bathroom.

01:08:58.350 --> 01:08:59.004
[door slams]

01:08:59.046 --> 01:08:59.700
Oh.

01:08:59.743 --> 01:09:00.571
Mrs. Miller, please.

01:09:00.613 --> 01:09:01.788
I'll be right back.

01:09:01.832 --> 01:09:03.835
I just have to use the bathroom.

01:09:03.877 --> 01:09:04.923
OK, fine.

01:09:04.966 --> 01:09:08.187
[fast music]

01:09:13.236 --> 01:09:14.237
[door slams]

01:09:14.279 --> 01:09:15.977
Mrs. Miller, we need to go.

01:09:22.069 --> 01:09:22.636
Mrs. Miller?

01:09:26.249 --> 01:09:27.118
Oh, Jesus.

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:27.772
Jesus.

01:09:30.644 --> 01:09:31.950
Michelle, I-- I--

01:09:31.993 --> 01:09:33.734
I-- I need an APB right
away on Karen Miller.

01:09:33.778 --> 01:09:34.779
Her stats are on my desk.

01:09:34.822 --> 01:09:37.129
She's driving a silver BMW.

01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:38.348
Put it out right now.

01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:40.219
Yeah, thanks.

01:09:40.263 --> 01:09:40.828
Dammit.

01:09:48.575 --> 01:09:49.794
What the hell, Karen?

01:09:49.837 --> 01:09:51.055
Molly, I need your help.

01:09:51.099 --> 01:09:52.274
What is going on?

01:09:52.318 --> 01:09:53.667
Joe said the police
are looking for you.

01:09:53.711 --> 01:09:55.016
It's David.

01:09:55.060 --> 01:09:55.930
What?

01:09:55.974 --> 01:09:58.368
He's alive, and he has Annie.

01:09:58.411 --> 01:09:59.978
You have to call the police.

01:10:00.021 --> 01:10:01.284
No, I can't.

01:10:01.327 --> 01:10:03.068
I just need a few more
hours to get her back.

01:10:03.111 --> 01:10:04.722
But I need a favor.

01:10:04.765 --> 01:10:07.290
Karen, if David is threatening
you, we need to get help.

01:10:07.333 --> 01:10:08.378
The police will be better--

01:10:08.421 --> 01:10:10.423
No, he will hurt Annie.

01:10:10.467 --> 01:10:12.033
Please.

01:10:12.077 --> 01:10:13.818
Molly, please.

01:10:13.861 --> 01:10:14.906
What do you need?

01:10:19.693 --> 01:10:20.955
Are you sure about this?

01:10:20.999 --> 01:10:22.566
Yeah. the police are
looking for my car.

01:10:22.609 --> 01:10:24.132
I'll just take it
for a few hours.

01:10:24.176 --> 01:10:25.177
I promise.

01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:26.265
Oh, thank you so much.

01:10:26.309 --> 01:10:28.136
Yeah.

01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:28.920
Be careful.

01:10:28.963 --> 01:10:30.356
I will. I promise.

01:10:30.878 --> 01:10:32.532
[huffs]

01:10:32.576 --> 01:10:33.229
Bye.

01:10:33.272 --> 01:10:35.579
Bye.

01:10:35.622 --> 01:10:38.712
[engine starts]

01:10:44.892 --> 01:10:46.546
KAREN [ON PHONE]:
David, where are you?

01:10:46.590 --> 01:10:47.765
Meet me at the house.

01:10:47.808 --> 01:10:49.201
KAREN [ON PHONE]:
Is Annie with you?

01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:50.811
Mm-hm.

01:10:50.855 --> 01:10:52.813
KAREN [ON PHONE]: David,
I can't go to the house.

01:10:52.857 --> 01:10:54.119
The police are looking for me.

01:10:54.162 --> 01:10:56.164
Police are nowhere
near your house, Karen.

01:10:56.208 --> 01:10:56.904
I have a scanner.

01:10:56.948 --> 01:10:58.166
They're all downtown.

01:10:58.210 --> 01:10:59.037
Wait, David.

01:10:59.080 --> 01:10:59.994
DAVID [ON PHONE]: Gotta go.

01:11:03.084 --> 01:11:05.043
Ready to go see your
mom for the last time?

01:11:07.785 --> 01:11:08.699
Excuse me.

01:11:08.742 --> 01:11:10.309
I'm sorry to trouble you.

01:11:10.353 --> 01:11:14.748
Did you happen to see who was
driving that silver vehicle?

01:11:14.792 --> 01:11:16.359
I think she took off on foot.

01:11:16.402 --> 01:11:17.055
On foot?

01:11:17.098 --> 01:11:17.838
Yeah.

01:11:17.882 --> 01:11:19.057
Thank you very much.

01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:19.710
Have a nice day.

01:11:24.802 --> 01:11:26.543
Welcome home, honey.

01:11:26.586 --> 01:11:27.892
Where's Annie?

01:11:27.935 --> 01:11:29.372
Oh, she's waiting--

01:11:29.415 --> 01:11:29.981
in the truck.

01:11:33.854 --> 01:11:36.161
I need to see her right now.

01:11:36.204 --> 01:11:37.031
I want my money.

01:11:37.075 --> 01:11:39.207
It is in a secure account.

01:11:39.251 --> 01:11:41.384
You give me Annie, and I
will give you the number.

01:11:41.427 --> 01:11:43.211
I will get it for you after
you give me my daughter.

01:11:43.255 --> 01:11:45.692
I don't want any your phony
account information, Karen.

01:11:45.736 --> 01:11:48.129
I'm sick of you
playing games with me.

01:11:48.173 --> 01:11:49.043
What do you want?

01:11:49.087 --> 01:11:50.741
Cash!

01:11:50.784 --> 01:11:52.699
I want the money!

01:11:52.743 --> 01:11:54.310
The bank is closed.

01:11:59.445 --> 01:12:02.405
Well, then I guess we better
get comfortable because we're

01:12:02.448 --> 01:12:03.797
in for a long night of waiting.

01:12:06.409 --> 01:12:07.714
No.

01:12:07.758 --> 01:12:08.759
No, you can't leave her
in the truck like that.

01:12:08.802 --> 01:12:09.629
Yes, I can.

01:12:09.673 --> 01:12:10.413
She can wait till--

01:12:10.456 --> 01:12:11.414
No you can't.

01:12:11.457 --> 01:12:12.284
I need to see her right now.

01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:13.372
No.

01:12:13.416 --> 01:12:14.547
I need to see my
daughter right now.

01:12:14.591 --> 01:12:15.243
No.

01:12:15.287 --> 01:12:16.332
Yes. Yes. Yes!

01:12:16.375 --> 01:12:17.550
Or you're not
getting your money.

01:12:17.594 --> 01:12:18.725
Do you understand me?

01:12:18.769 --> 01:12:20.074
Right now!

01:12:20.118 --> 01:12:21.162
Oh my god.

01:12:21.206 --> 01:12:21.815
OK.

01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:29.040
Don't threaten my money again.

01:12:29.083 --> 01:12:29.954
OK.

01:12:29.997 --> 01:12:33.305
David, I just need to see her.

01:12:33.349 --> 01:12:35.307
Please?

01:12:35.351 --> 01:12:39.180
[threatening music]

01:12:43.228 --> 01:12:44.577
See?

01:12:44.621 --> 01:12:47.363
[dog barking]

01:12:47.406 --> 01:12:47.972
Stay.

01:12:54.326 --> 01:12:54.761
Annie!

01:12:54.805 --> 01:12:55.501
See?

01:12:55.545 --> 01:12:56.154
Safe and sound.

01:12:56.197 --> 01:12:57.285
Please!

01:12:57.329 --> 01:12:58.417
David, let me have
a moment with her.

01:12:58.461 --> 01:12:59.331
You can't leave her like this.

01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:00.637
OK, Annie, I love you.

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:02.421
All right, that's good enough.

01:13:02.465 --> 01:13:04.380
[annie screams]

01:13:10.821 --> 01:13:11.691
[door rattles]

01:13:11.735 --> 01:13:12.344
Have a seat.

01:13:15.434 --> 01:13:18.916
[chair squeaks]

01:13:21.222 --> 01:13:24.356
David, you have to let her go.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.401
She's cold out there.

01:13:27.751 --> 01:13:28.665
Please.

01:13:28.708 --> 01:13:29.405
I'll do whatever you want.

01:13:32.886 --> 01:13:38.370
All I want is
for you to relax.

01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:40.241
How about some wine?

01:13:40.285 --> 01:13:40.894
What?

01:13:43.593 --> 01:13:45.508
Red OK?

01:13:45.551 --> 01:13:49.033
[ominous music]

01:13:52.471 --> 01:13:55.735
[whistles]

01:13:55.779 --> 01:13:56.388
[glasses slam]

01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:58.695
Relax.

01:13:58.738 --> 01:14:01.915
[bottle lid spinning]

01:14:01.959 --> 01:14:02.916
Why did you do it?

01:14:06.529 --> 01:14:08.792
Why'd you marry me?

01:14:08.835 --> 01:14:12.230
Well, I married you
'cause I wanted you.

01:14:12.273 --> 01:14:17.235
And I left because
I don't anymore.

01:14:20.934 --> 01:14:23.589
How could you do that?

01:14:23.633 --> 01:14:24.808
It's not easy.

01:14:24.851 --> 01:14:26.070
I mean, not the first time.

01:14:26.113 --> 01:14:28.812
The second time was
a little bit better.

01:14:28.855 --> 01:14:31.031
By the time I got to you--

01:14:31.075 --> 01:14:32.511
You've done this before?

01:14:32.555 --> 01:14:36.428
You know, I think you met
my third wife, Jessica Reid.

01:14:38.952 --> 01:14:41.259
She was trying to track me down.

01:14:41.302 --> 01:14:47.178
When I saw you two yapping
it up at the Heights Hotel--

01:14:47.221 --> 01:14:50.964
obviously couldn't
have that, so--

01:14:51.008 --> 01:14:52.096
You killed her?

01:14:52.139 --> 01:14:54.968
Well, not just her, Karen.

01:14:55.012 --> 01:14:58.450
See, Amy-- now, that--

01:14:58.494 --> 01:14:59.712
Amy was a good girl.

01:14:59.756 --> 01:15:02.106
She didn't give me any trouble.

01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:03.368
And she's doing fine now.

01:15:03.411 --> 01:15:03.977
She's in Arizona.

01:15:04.021 --> 01:15:06.545
She's remarried.

01:15:06.589 --> 01:15:10.201
But Danica-- mm.

01:15:10.244 --> 01:15:11.463
[giggles]

01:15:11.507 --> 01:15:15.554
Danica wouldn't cooperate.

01:15:15.598 --> 01:15:18.426
You're sick.

01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:20.559
No.

01:15:20.603 --> 01:15:24.955
No, but-- they make me do this.

01:15:24.998 --> 01:15:28.828
Kid, I have had to kill
myself four times already.

01:15:28.872 --> 01:15:30.177
Do you-- do you
think that's easy

01:15:30.221 --> 01:15:33.572
for me, coming up with
a plausible way to die

01:15:33.616 --> 01:15:35.052
and leaving no body behind?

01:15:38.751 --> 01:15:41.841
But, you know, I
think this last death,

01:15:41.885 --> 01:15:46.193
I think it's my best work yet.

01:15:46.237 --> 01:15:47.978
Mm.

01:15:48.021 --> 01:15:52.069
Oh my god, that is something.

01:15:52.112 --> 01:15:53.374
Do you remember
that trip to Napa

01:15:53.418 --> 01:15:55.594
we took where we
picked this bad boy up?

01:15:55.638 --> 01:15:56.943
Mm.

01:15:56.987 --> 01:15:58.989
Oh, what was the name
of that lovely bistro,

01:15:59.032 --> 01:16:00.643
the one with the view?

01:16:00.686 --> 01:16:02.340
Cafe Laurent.

01:16:02.383 --> 01:16:03.428
Cafe Laurent!

01:16:03.471 --> 01:16:04.342
That's it!

01:16:04.385 --> 01:16:06.431
Oh, that was driving me nuts!

01:16:06.474 --> 01:16:07.606
Thank you, honey.

01:16:07.650 --> 01:16:08.825
Cafe Laurent.

01:16:08.868 --> 01:16:11.349
David, Annie's out
there in the cold.

01:16:11.392 --> 01:16:12.829
Karen!

01:16:12.872 --> 01:16:14.700
She's fine.

01:16:14.744 --> 01:16:16.006
She's safe.

01:16:16.049 --> 01:16:17.050
She can breathe.

01:16:17.094 --> 01:16:19.531
Just stop with that.

01:16:19.575 --> 01:16:21.315
[whimpers]

01:16:21.359 --> 01:16:24.928
[phone ringing and buzzing]

01:16:27.408 --> 01:16:29.672
Oh!

01:16:29.715 --> 01:16:31.021
Oh!

01:16:31.064 --> 01:16:32.631
Incoming call from Neil.

01:16:32.675 --> 01:16:35.678
You have to let me get
that or he's going to worry.
