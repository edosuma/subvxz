00:01.523 --> 00:04.867
Mr. Scott, this kidnapping
happened right under your nose.

00:05.672 --> 00:07.078
What do we know
about the female?

00:07.109 --> 00:08.437
This is Rachel Dalton.

00:08.476 --> 00:09.594
Sir, she's one of ours.

00:09.617 --> 00:11.500
Tonight you'll be employing
live rounds.

00:12.680 --> 00:13.859
Jake!

00:15.008 --> 00:16.750
Probably you're about
to be taken.

00:17.664 --> 00:19.531
It's Damien.
He's in trouble.

00:19.555 --> 00:21.609
- What's in the case?
- Nuclear triggers.

00:21.734 --> 00:23.266
I won't lose the triggers.

00:23.305 --> 00:25.516
Section 20 requires
new leadership.

00:25.586 --> 00:28.195
Some of you already know
Captain Dalton.

00:28.227 --> 00:29.148
You're shitting me.

00:29.188 --> 00:31.328
- Can we start again?
- Of course we can.

00:32.375 --> 00:33.844
Kerry. Kerry!

They've identified
Craig Hanson

00:50.642 --> 00:53.777
as the man who
murdered your wife.

00:53.812 --> 00:56.413
How do you feel
about that?

00:56.448 --> 00:58.315
When I heard, I
wanted to kill him.

00:58.349 --> 01:00.116
And now?

01:03.119 --> 01:04.852
He's sick.

01:04.887 --> 01:05.853
He'll be caught.

01:05.888 --> 01:07.855
Anger and rage
are legitimate sentiments

01:07.922 --> 01:09.289
at this stage,
Sergeant.

01:09.323 --> 01:11.257
For example,
it wouldn't be unusual

01:11.291 --> 01:14.092
if right now
you wanted revenge.

01:14.126 --> 01:15.693
The system will
take care of Hanson.

01:15.728 --> 01:16.794
You trust the system?

01:16.828 --> 01:18.195
I'm a soldier.

01:20.631 --> 01:23.432
Michael Stonebridge
has requested reassignment

01:23.500 --> 01:24.633
to this unit.

01:24.668 --> 01:26.802
And you approved
that?

01:26.836 --> 01:28.904
Subject to a psych
evaluation, yes.

01:28.939 --> 01:30.940
This isn't a
rehabilitation ward.

01:30.974 --> 01:32.141
You put him back
in the field now,

01:32.175 --> 01:33.843
you put him and anyone
operating with him

01:33.877 --> 01:35.512
at risk.

01:35.546 --> 01:37.447
So I have to ask,
why would you do that?

01:37.482 --> 01:38.715
We need the best.

01:38.750 --> 01:41.751
If he passes the evaluation,
that's good enough for me.

01:41.786 --> 01:43.753
Hanson was
a soldier, too,

01:43.788 --> 01:46.056
but he murdered
your wife.

01:46.091 --> 01:48.559
A gun and a uniform don't
make you a soldier.

01:48.593 --> 01:50.761
Real soldiers
don't do bad things.

01:50.795 --> 01:52.263
We follow orders.

01:52.297 --> 01:54.631
So the killing
isn't personal...

01:57.668 --> 01:59.235
You bring
Stonebridge back,

01:59.269 --> 02:00.370
he owes you.

02:00.404 --> 02:01.638
And your point is?

02:01.672 --> 02:04.908
Isn't that how you
intelligence types operate?

02:04.942 --> 02:07.677
He owes you,
you own him.

02:07.712 --> 02:10.913
You are aware that if you
admitted a desire for revenge,

02:10.949 --> 02:13.116
you would fail
this evaluation?

02:13.150 --> 02:14.651
I am.

02:16.087 --> 02:18.488
You might not like it,
Major Sinclair,

02:18.522 --> 02:21.057
but as things stand,
I command this unit,

02:21.091 --> 02:25.694
so let's be clear, shall we?
I own you all.

02:25.728 --> 02:27.496
Scott, if Stonebridge
does come back,

02:27.530 --> 02:29.497
you'll be out
in the field with him.

that Axmali has

04:49.840 --> 04:52.175
the triggers
that we missed

Given what's at stake,
we have to assume so.

NSA tracked the call that ordered

10:47.633 --> 10:49.333
Bombing the compound

12:12.875 --> 12:16.345

12:16.379 --> 12:17.913
Why were you bombing it?

12:17.947 --> 12:22.251

12:25.021 --> 12:27.720
I was with 20,

12:27.754 --> 12:30.153
I should see that they're

12:30.221 --> 12:31.421
They know.

12:31.455 --> 12:33.322
Everything?

yourself?

13:12.622 --> 13:16.124
Like you care.

13:16.159 --> 13:18.093
You think...

13:18.161 --> 13:19.928
because they say
"pardon me"

13:19.962 --> 13:22.564
before they cut
a guy's throat,

13:22.598 --> 13:24.098

45:04.429 --> 45:05.729
Shit. Copy that.

45:05.764 --> 45:07.097
They'll never make
it to the border.

45:07.132 --> 45:08.399
Get the Algerians.

45:08.433 --> 45:09.933
Tell them it's
an accidental intrusion.

45:09.968 --> 45:12.002
They let us get our men out
or they do it for us.

45:12.037 --> 45:14.005
All right, we got to move
or everyone's gonna die.

45:14.039 --> 45:15.640
- Hey.
- What?

45:15.674 --> 45:16.875
What about the triggers?

45:16.909 --> 45:18.042
Fuck it.
We're out of time.

45:18.077 --> 45:19.144
We got to go, or these
people are gonna die.

45:19.178 --> 45:20.112
Hey, hey, hey.

45:20.146 --> 45:21.480
You guys just stay
here, all right?

45:21.514 --> 45:23.448
You understand? You, come here.
You're coming with us.

45:23.483 --> 45:24.483
Come on.
Come on.

45:24.517 --> 45:25.951
I can't.
I have to get home.

45:25.985 --> 45:27.853
I don't give a shit.
We'll drop you there later. Come on.

45:27.888 --> 45:30.656
We'll take good care
of you, all right?

45:30.690 --> 45:33.659
And you,
get the fuck up.

45:33.693 --> 45:38.997
♪

45:39.032 --> 45:40.899
The guys
from Mogadishu...

45:40.934 --> 45:42.534
They must be
after the triggers.

45:42.569 --> 45:43.635
Get them in.
Get them in.

45:43.703 --> 45:44.770
Come on.

45:48.108 --> 45:50.976
They're called
Section 20.

45:51.011 --> 45:53.846
Tactical Operations Unit.

45:53.880 --> 45:54.847
Hey.
Got him?

45:54.915 --> 45:55.882
Bravo, get back
to the border.

45:55.916 --> 45:57.250
Keep Othmani alive.

45:57.284 --> 45:58.984
Right now he's the only
card you hold.

45:59.019 --> 46:00.719
Yeah, ok.

46:04.591 --> 46:06.792
Ah, I don't think

46:06.826 --> 46:10.429
we need to worry
about 20.

46:10.463 --> 46:12.264
That's El Soldat.

46:13.867 --> 46:16.135
Fire!
