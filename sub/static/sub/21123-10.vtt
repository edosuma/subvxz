Going somewhere, sweetheart?

00:49.360 --> 00:51.520
Well, we all are. Back to LA, of course.

00:52.160 --> 00:54.800
That's why you came here, right?
To take us all home.

00:54.880 --> 00:58.080
Back to the mall, back to friends,
back to everything that we find normal...

00:59.480 --> 01:03.000
Breakfast now, home talk later, okay?
I just got here.

01:03.320 --> 01:05.160
- And Zoe's big show is today.
- Um...

01:05.880 --> 01:08.080
- I might not be doing the show.
- Oh.

01:08.640 --> 01:11.280
- Sweetie, what's wrong?
- This is about Raven, isn't it?

01:12.160 --> 01:13.400
I can't do it without him.

01:13.480 --> 01:16.440
Then you need to let Sam know.
You owe her that much.

01:16.800 --> 01:17.800
Okay.

01:18.680 --> 01:20.800
Seriously, Zoe, don't stress about this.

01:21.480 --> 01:24.760
Taking Mia's place on the team
was a big ask, even for you.

01:24.840 --> 01:28.080
I'm so sorry, Sam.
I thought I could do it, but...

01:28.200 --> 01:32.240
Not another word. It's done.
I will sort this. Somehow.

01:32.320 --> 01:35.120
Thank you for being so cool about this.

01:35.200 --> 01:36.800
I can't force you to ride for us, Zoe.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.880
But won't you always wonder
what it would've felt like?

01:42.680 --> 01:46.480
Just being there, in the ring,
in front of all those people,

01:46.560 --> 01:48.040
just you and your horse,

01:48.120 --> 01:50.320
and those fences you've cleared
a hundred times.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.480
I won't be on Raven.

01:51.560 --> 01:55.480
A good rider can ride any horse well.
You're not a <i>good </i>rider, Zoe.

01:55.880 --> 01:58.640
- Exactly.
- But, you could be a great one.

02:00.480 --> 02:01.880
Don't you wanna know for sure?

02:06.920 --> 02:08.840
Do the show, Zoe.

02:09.440 --> 02:11.920
Cut it out, Marcus.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.360
Oh. I forgot you're immune to my charm.

02:14.440 --> 02:17.360
- Hmm. You know it.
- Did Sam talk you round?

02:18.880 --> 02:21.720
I guess I can't let...
all our training go to waste.

02:21.800 --> 02:24.080
Yes! Now we're totally gonna win.

02:24.160 --> 02:26.880
Yeah, if I don't fall... or bolt.

02:26.960 --> 02:30.160
Or humiliate myself
in some other wonderful way.

02:30.240 --> 02:32.040
- Never gonna happen.
- Ah...

02:32.120 --> 02:33.520
You're amazing, you know that?

02:34.560 --> 02:37.080
Pin's a lucky guy.
You guys are good together.

02:37.960 --> 02:41.160
We get each other, definitely,
but we aren't together.

02:42.080 --> 02:46.160
I mean, we're together a lot,
but not in a "together" kind of way.

02:47.280 --> 02:48.720
[stammers] But I thought that you...

02:49.640 --> 02:51.400
This show-jumping outfit is so cute.

02:52.280 --> 02:56.120
You might actually look good today.
[chuckles] Come here.

03:02.840 --> 03:05.240
You could probably make
these jodhpurs work in LA.

03:07.600 --> 03:10.200
Rosie... when we get back home,

03:10.280 --> 03:12.680
it might not be the same as before.
You know that, right?

03:12.760 --> 03:15.440
[sighs] Yeah. I know.

03:17.240 --> 03:19.560
You're clearly gonna join
some lame horse-riding club

03:19.640 --> 03:21.720
and bring all of that nonsense
back with you.

03:21.800 --> 03:24.320
[sighs] I mean with Mom and Dad.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.800
Dad came, Zoe. They're talking.

03:27.360 --> 03:28.360
It's gonna be okay.

03:30.040 --> 03:33.640
Whatever happens... we'll have each other.

03:34.360 --> 03:36.840
- Sisters forever.

Good luck today. I'll see you there.

04:21.240 --> 04:23.480
[exhales deeply] Okay, let's go.

04:29.080 --> 04:31.240
There are different classes
throughout the day,

04:31.320 --> 04:34.080
- such as tack and turnout, dressage...
- Featuring me and Bob.

04:34.160 --> 04:36.320
Right, but the big thing
is team show jumping.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.400
That's your event.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.520
Yes, yes, I'm aware of that fact.

04:39.640 --> 04:41.720
- And everyone's counting on you.
- Also aware.

04:42.280 --> 04:45.600
Show jumping is the event
with the most points. Kind of important.

04:45.680 --> 04:47.400
- Are you nervous?
- No, I'm not nervous.

04:47.480 --> 04:49.200
- You look nervous.
- Why should I be?

04:49.280 --> 04:52.560
The crowds, kids that have been riding
since before they could walk...

04:52.640 --> 04:53.840
Can you make her stop?

04:54.440 --> 04:57.640
No, but... I can give you this.

04:58.920 --> 05:01.120
Some people believe
horseshoes bring good luck.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.960
Clearly those people have never had
one land on their heads.

05:04.040 --> 05:05.560
It's Raven's. I thought it might help.

05:06.560 --> 05:10.480
- That's pretty superstitious for you.
- Yeah, well, maybe this summer's shown me

05:10.560 --> 05:12.920
that not everything can be explained
by logic.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.280
Obviously, most things can.

05:16.080 --> 05:18.400
- Guys, we're here.
- Go!

05:20.360 --> 05:21.360
Come on, girls.

05:32.240 --> 05:34.000
Welcome to the county show.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.480
Holloway, our main rivals.

05:46.040 --> 05:47.200
Look at him, giving us evils.

05:47.760 --> 05:50.440
Uh, guys,
I don't think he's looking at us...

05:57.240 --> 06:00.120
So... your plan worked.
You're on the team.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.456
- What? No, there was no plan...
- I'm kidding. [chuckles]

06:02.480 --> 06:03.480
I came to wish you luck.

06:04.640 --> 06:06.080
- Really?
- Sure.

06:06.760 --> 06:09.960
Also, your shirt's untucked in the back,
your tie isn't straight,

06:10.040 --> 06:12.360
and you've got a button undone.
Sort it out, Zoe.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.720
We don't want people thinking
our standards have slipped.

06:16.080 --> 06:17.080
Susie.

06:17.760 --> 06:20.040
Oh, I was just gonna get Darcy ready.

06:20.120 --> 06:22.520
My bags aren't gonna carry themselves,
are they?

06:25.280 --> 06:29.880
I probably shouldn't tell you this,
but my first show, I fell off.

06:30.440 --> 06:33.000
- Are you serious?
- In front of everyone. [chuckles]

06:33.080 --> 06:35.040
It was pretty dramatic. My horse threw me.

06:35.120 --> 06:37.200
Similar to the way Raven threw you
on the beach,

06:37.760 --> 06:39.520
but with an audience of hundreds.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.360
[all chuckle]

06:41.440 --> 06:43.800
But I got back on
and I rode a clear round.

06:44.960 --> 06:48.640
- No way.
- Sometimes life throws scary stuff at you,

06:48.720 --> 06:51.120
and it's not
until you face that stuff head-on,

06:51.680 --> 06:53.440
that you realize how capable you are.

06:53.520 --> 06:55.360
You've got this, Zoe.

06:57.520 --> 07:01.600
Rosie. I noticed
you are not wearing a stable hoodie.

07:01.680 --> 07:04.800
[scoffs] No offense.
I wouldn't be caught dead wearing one.

07:05.680 --> 07:07.600
I know, but...

07:10.000 --> 07:11.400
[exclaims] It's pink!

07:11.960 --> 07:14.440
- We keep these for special occasions.
- I love pink.

07:14.520 --> 07:16.360
[laughing]

07:29.560 --> 07:30.560
Can I help you?

07:32.400 --> 07:34.200
I very much doubt it.

07:36.440 --> 07:39.240
- I'm looking for Zoe Phillips.
- What do you want with Zoe?

07:40.320 --> 07:43.000
That's no concern of yours. Good day.

07:55.440 --> 07:56.440
Come on, boy.

07:56.840 --> 07:59.880
- Where are you rushing off to?
- I want to see Zoe before the show starts.

08:00.640 --> 08:04.400
- I see.
- It's not what you think. It's Raven.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
[Pin clicks tongue]

08:11.200 --> 08:13.880
That's right, boy.
You keep telling yourself that.

08:21.840 --> 08:25.560
- [Becky] Wait till you see Bob's dressage.
- [Jade] Okay, it'll be fine.

08:27.160 --> 08:28.200
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.240
Be careful out there.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.600
Of course I will. [chuckles nervously]

08:32.680 --> 08:34.240
Sam said Raven threw you.

08:35.160 --> 08:37.920
Yeah, he did. It was pretty horrible.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.520
You were hurt, and I didn't know.

08:43.520 --> 08:46.280
Nobody knew. Nobody knew because I...

08:52.200 --> 08:54.080
'Cause I didn't tell anyone.

08:57.560 --> 08:58.560
I'll see you later.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.160
Sam?

09:04.240 --> 09:06.520
How did you know
Raven threw me on the beach?

09:07.040 --> 09:08.400
- What?
- How did you know?

09:08.480 --> 09:10.240
- [Raven whinnies]
- [Zoe grunts]

09:11.520 --> 09:14.200
Um... I mean, I'm... I'm not sure.

09:14.360 --> 09:16.680
Uh... Marcus must have said something.

09:17.240 --> 09:19.200
No, because I didn't tell him anything.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.040
I didn't tell anybody.

09:21.240 --> 09:23.320
Not even my own family,
'cause I was ashamed.

09:23.400 --> 09:25.200
- I don't have time for this, Zoe.
- No.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.080
[Zoe] <i>I saw someone in the lane that day.</i>

09:34.520 --> 09:38.080
<i>The horse thieves must have had someone
on the inside working for them.</i>

09:38.160 --> 09:40.680
There were three guys
the first time they tried to take him.

09:40.760 --> 09:42.720
The photographer must've been working
with them...

09:42.760 --> 09:43.960
Zoe, that's enough.

09:44.480 --> 09:48.080
[Zoe] <i>You used my connection with Raven</i>
<i>to tame him so you could take him.</i>

09:48.160 --> 09:51.400
Raven is a different horse.
That's all because of you.

09:51.480 --> 09:53.200
I am so proud of you, Zoe.

09:53.280 --> 09:55.040
- We just caught the horse thief.
- What?

09:55.120 --> 09:56.720
It's true. We totally caught him.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.840
[Zoe] <i>When I told you, you looked scared.</i>

09:58.920 --> 10:00.840
- So, you're clear with the plan?
- [woman] Yeah.

10:00.920 --> 10:01.920
Good.

10:02.920 --> 10:05.000
[Zoe] <i>It was you and George all along.</i>

10:10.600 --> 10:11.840
First Pin, now me?

10:12.600 --> 10:15.080
Is no one safe from your wild accusations?

10:15.160 --> 10:17.520
Why would you do something like this?

10:18.480 --> 10:19.600
We all trusted you.

10:19.680 --> 10:22.000
You always said nothing
was more important than the horses.

10:22.040 --> 10:23.680
What mattered more than Raven, Sam?

Zoe, hang on. I need to talk to you.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.960

- They're taking him to Wrecker's Cove.

If you go now, you can save him.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.560
Uh, where do you think you're going?

12:04.640 --> 12:08.080
Raven is still on the island.
It was Sam. It was Sam all along.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.360
Sam? Well, we need to tell Derek.

12:10.880 --> 12:14.560
We still don't know who's in on it.
I need you to act like everything is okay.

13:47.760 --> 13:51.360
- Hey, where's Zoe?
- She just couldn't handle the pressure.

13:51.720 --> 13:52.720
That's not true.

13:53.440 --> 13:55.760
- Is it?
- I always knew she'd buckle.

13:56.400 --> 13:59.760
I mean, she makes out to be this big hero,
but really it's just for show.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.201
I think she went
to work things out with Pin.

14:04.240 --> 14:07.600
If Zoe doesn't do her round,
then there's no way we can win.

14:08.120 --> 14:12.000
- [man on PA] <i>Last call for Zoe Phillips.</i>
- Susie, come on.

14:12.480 --> 14:14.360
Maybe we shouldn't have pushed her.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.080
No, no, we didn't push her.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.320
Now, now, you two, she'll turn up.

14:19.280 --> 14:20.960
Yeah, my girl's no quitter.

14:25.160 --> 14:26.160
[Pin] Hey!

14:26.760 --> 14:29.000
- What's going on in there?
- Deal with him.

14:29.560 --> 14:30.560
Is that a horse?

14:31.880 --> 14:33.080
Okay, okay, okay.

14:34.280 --> 14:36.320
- [Pin] What's going on?
- [man] Nothing.

14:36.400 --> 14:37.800
[Pin] I wanna know what's going on.

14:38.880 --> 14:39.880
[man] Beat it.

14:41.400 --> 14:42.680
[Zoe] Raven.

14:44.040 --> 14:45.080
Raven.

14:53.840 --> 14:57.800
Okay, I'm gonna get you out of here. Okay.
I'm gonna get you out of here. Okay.

14:58.400 --> 15:01.400
I had a feeling you might show up.
Stand up.

15:04.880 --> 15:05.920
[Zoe] I'm taking him home.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.400
We can't let some little girl stand
in our way.

15:10.840 --> 15:13.680
His new owner's been waiting for him
for a very long time.

15:13.760 --> 15:16.600
And they're getting impatient,
so step away from the horse.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.440
I guess this thing does bring good luck.

15:24.760 --> 15:25.840
Okay, let's go. Come on.

15:28.680 --> 15:30.640
- Block the exit!
- Get out of here, Zoe!

15:33.560 --> 15:34.600
Get ready, boys!

15:34.680 --> 15:36.320
All right, boy. Come on, we got this.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.360
Don't let her go past!

15:45.000 --> 15:46.720

We got it.

- Yeah.

19:04.280 --> 19:05.880
[Sam] Bright Fields was losing money.

19:07.080 --> 19:09.600
I thought I was gonna have to sell
my dad's yard.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.320
And then George called.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.120
Hello, Sam.

19:15.200 --> 19:19.680
He offered to give me a cut of the money
if I would help his gang steal Raven.

19:21.520 --> 19:24.000
Raven is valuable... isn't he?

19:24.880 --> 19:26.360
You have no idea.

19:30.160 --> 19:32.080
I used you, Zoe.

19:33.360 --> 19:36.640
I used you so you would train Raven,
and he would go quietly.

19:38.880 --> 19:40.080
I betrayed you both.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.800
And I... I am so sorry.

You always tell us
it's not the mistakes that matter.

Zoe, get back in this car. We are leaving.

- You can't take him. I won't let you.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.560
How dare you tell me
what to do with my horse?

31:16.640 --> 31:19.560
You may own him, but you don't know him.
Not like I do.

31:19.640 --> 31:22.040
And you definitely don't know what's best
for him.

31:22.120 --> 31:24.280
He's not just
some super valuable racehorse.

31:24.360 --> 31:26.480
He's a frightened, messed up runaway,

31:26.560 --> 31:29.960
who's found a safe home
and people who love him.

31:30.040 --> 31:32.520

- Fine.

31:33.480 --> 31:34.480

- What do you mean, fine?
- I'm no fool.

31:37.600 --> 31:39.840
I can see the bond between the two of you.

31:40.480 --> 31:43.720
Someone's got to train this horse.
I suppose it might as well be you.

31:43.800 --> 31:45.960
Wait. Okay, I didn't mean...

31:46.040 --> 31:49.200
We'll stable him here at Bright Fields,
he'll need a lot of work,

31:49.440 --> 31:53.000
but you've made an effective start,
I'm sure we can bring him up to standard.

31:53.880 --> 31:57.200
- But I'm flying back to the States today.
- Are you?

31:57.760 --> 32:01.080
I'm done. I'm done. I give up.
I'm leaving. I'm going back to LA.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.280
