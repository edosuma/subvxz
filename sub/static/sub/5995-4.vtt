00:01.335 --> 00:05.773
HEATHER:
As Jean-Paul Sartre
said, "We are our choices."

00:05.806 --> 00:08.376
And this woman's choices
are nuts.

00:08.409 --> 00:10.444
I mean,
she's seriously bonker balls.

00:10.478 --> 00:11.779
WOMAN: Heather, we don't use
terms like that

00:11.812 --> 00:14.182
in abnormal psychology.

00:14.215 --> 00:18.186
I'm sorry, "bonker balls"
isn't in the DSM-5 yet? Okay.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.820
Because that's what she is.

00:19.853 --> 00:23.724
I mean, you kind of have
to, like, see it to believe it.

00:23.757 --> 00:26.560
I don't even know where the hell
she came from.

00:26.594 --> 00:28.562
REBECCA:
* I was

00:28.596 --> 00:30.131
* Working hard
at a New York job *

00:30.164 --> 00:31.665
* Making dough
but it made me blue *

00:31.699 --> 00:33.367
* One day I was crying a lot

00:33.401 --> 00:34.735
* And so I decided to move

00:34.768 --> 00:36.470
* To West Covina, California

00:36.504 --> 00:37.705
* Brand-new pals
and new career *

00:37.738 --> 00:39.707
* It happens to be
where Josh lives *

00:39.740 --> 00:42.576
* But that's not why I'm here

00:42.610 --> 00:44.678
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *
What? No, I'm not.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.414
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *

00:46.447 --> 00:47.415
That's a sexist term.

00:47.448 --> 00:49.150
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *

00:49.183 --> 00:50.284
Can you guys stop singing
for just a second?

00:50.318 --> 00:52.820
* She's so broken inside *

00:52.853 --> 00:54.422
The situation's a lot more
nuanced than that.

00:54.455 --> 00:56.424
* C-R-A-Z-Y *

00:56.457 --> 00:57.625
Okay! We get it!

00:57.658 --> 00:59.427
* Crazy ex-girlfriend. *

00:59.460 --> 01:02.096
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, how do
I stop?! How do I stop?!

01:02.130 --> 01:05.366
Oh, oh, oh! Oh, thank you
for stopping me.
Okay.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.535
Okay, now, you know that
YouTube tutorial we watched,

01:07.568 --> 01:09.270
TonyHawkFan49 said
if you want to stop,

01:09.303 --> 01:10.804
you lean back on your tail.

01:10.838 --> 01:12.573
Yeah, that's only useful advice
if you're riding a dog.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.475
That's true. Okay,
how long do we have to risk

01:14.508 --> 01:16.744
bodily harm? I thought you said
Josh hit the skate park

01:16.777 --> 01:18.612
with his nephew
every Saturday morning.

01:18.646 --> 01:20.448
Yeah, you know, they might.
I just thought it might be fun

01:20.481 --> 01:23.251
to run into him. But I want to
learn how to skate regardless.

01:23.284 --> 01:24.818
I want to shred some concrete.

01:25.853 --> 01:27.388
And now that Valencia says

01:27.421 --> 01:29.457
that it's cool for me and Josh
to hang out, you know,

01:29.490 --> 01:31.825
I thought I would learn,
so he and I could, like, chill

01:31.859 --> 01:32.793
and skate and hang.

01:32.826 --> 01:34.595
All right, well,
when are you guys gonna chill,

01:34.628 --> 01:37.331
skate, hang out next?
I mean, do you have a plan?

01:37.365 --> 01:40.334
No, he hasn't contacted me,
per se, but, you know...

01:40.368 --> 01:41.835
(laughing):
that's what he does.

01:41.869 --> 01:44.838
He pops up, disappears,
pops up, disappears.

01:44.872 --> 01:46.774
(phone chimes)
It's hilarious. Oh!

01:46.807 --> 01:48.876
Maybe this is him right
now. Oh, no, it's...

01:48.909 --> 01:52.346
it's not him, but it-it's, uh...
it's Instagram.

01:53.547 --> 01:55.883
A vacation in wine country.
How lovely.

01:55.916 --> 01:59.587
Oh, good God. The boobs,
the abs, the hair.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.355
I know.
Even her wrists are pretty.

02:01.389 --> 02:03.524
She never even had
an awkward phase.

02:03.557 --> 02:06.160
Believe me, I've checked
all of her Facebook albums.

02:06.194 --> 02:07.761
There are 180 of them.

02:07.795 --> 02:10.330
Oh, okay. Well,
you stop looking at that,

02:10.364 --> 02:11.432
'cause that's not healthy.
(phone ringing)

02:12.466 --> 02:13.501
(groans)
This is the fifth time

02:13.534 --> 02:14.435
she's called today.

02:14.468 --> 02:15.536
I really should pick this up.
No, no, no.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.638
No, don't.
You know what,
you should not pick this up

02:17.671 --> 02:19.540
'cause the last thing you need
right now is a conversation

02:19.573 --> 02:21.409
with a pathological narcissist.
Okay,

02:21.442 --> 02:22.510
you don't know her.
And if I don't answer,

02:22.543 --> 02:24.378
she's gonna keep calling me.

02:24.412 --> 02:25.946
She's like a stalker
I used to live inside of, okay?

02:25.979 --> 02:28.949
Just give me the... phone.
Oh. Oh!
Ninja!

02:28.982 --> 02:31.319
(both sigh)

02:31.352 --> 02:33.787
Hi, Mom! What's up?

02:33.821 --> 02:35.656
Put me on video chat or whatever

02:35.689 --> 02:37.525
you call it.
I want to see your face.

02:37.558 --> 02:38.892
No, I can hear your face.

02:38.926 --> 02:40.428
Just do it.

02:41.562 --> 02:43.531
I have exciting news.

02:43.564 --> 02:46.434
Wait, are you calling me
from Dr. Weinstein's office?

02:46.467 --> 02:47.968
Yes. I'm just waiting
for my Pap.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.971
Hey, little Becca, how are you?

02:51.004 --> 02:52.773
UTI's under control?

02:52.806 --> 02:54.408
NAOMI:
Anyway, I wanted to tell you

02:54.442 --> 02:55.909
that I was reading

02:55.943 --> 02:57.478
the Sunday Styles, and I saw

02:57.511 --> 03:00.214
that Audra Levine
just got married

03:00.248 --> 03:02.950
and to a hedge fund manager.

03:02.983 --> 03:05.319
Good for Audra Levine.
Also, she got

03:05.353 --> 03:07.321
the promotion you didn't take.
Remember?

03:07.355 --> 03:08.822
The one you were too good for?

03:08.856 --> 03:11.825
So now basically she has
the life you could have had,

03:11.859 --> 03:14.462
almost had,

03:14.495 --> 03:17.831
but ruined with
all your ridiculous choices.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.567
Okay.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.802
So nice talking to you, Mom.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.304
I'm hanging up now.

03:23.337 --> 03:25.706
But thanks for the salt
in the wound.

03:25.739 --> 03:27.975
At least it's
kosher salt!

03:28.008 --> 03:29.543
He delivered you.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.745
Okay, screw your mom.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.481
Screw Audra Levine.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.316
Okay, you are doing
just fine.

03:35.349 --> 03:37.851
No, I-I'm gonna go.
I'm gonna call you later, okay?

03:37.885 --> 03:40.020
No, no, no, no. Let's do
something to cheer you up.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.822
Look, I have to pick up Brendan
from therapy,

03:41.855 --> 03:44.325
but it's-it's right near
the Dress Barn.
No.

03:44.358 --> 03:45.459
* Right near
the Dress Barn *

03:45.493 --> 03:47.328
Come on, you love
the Dress Barn.
No. I'm gonna go.

03:47.361 --> 03:49.363
I'm gonna go.

03:50.364 --> 03:52.633
Hey, don't skate sad!

03:52.666 --> 03:55.503
Or maybe at all!

04:00.874 --> 04:04.312
Subject is approaching
and appears dejected.

04:04.345 --> 04:06.714
And possibly undergoing
cranial remolding.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.949
Hey, Heath.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.951
Name's Heather.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.886
But... So, how are you?

04:12.920 --> 04:14.555
And feel free
to use specific words

04:14.588 --> 04:16.890
like "despondent" or "hopeless"

04:16.923 --> 04:20.661
or, on a scale from one to ten,
rate your suicidal thoughts.

04:20.694 --> 04:23.597
Uh, I'm having the
worst day, dude.

04:23.631 --> 04:27.468
So, anyway, I've decided to eat
my feelings, and it turns out

04:27.501 --> 04:31.305
my feelings are pork
rinds, whoopie pies,

04:31.339 --> 04:34.375
mac and cheese. Yeah, I'm
going full-on Cathy cartoon.

04:34.408 --> 04:36.043
Can you not do that?

04:36.076 --> 04:37.010
Because we share a wall,

04:37.044 --> 04:39.780
and I don't want to hear you
barf-crying later.

04:39.813 --> 04:40.981
What do you suggest I do?
I mean, what do you do

04:41.014 --> 04:43.917
when you're feeling this bad?
And don't say get a tattoo

04:43.951 --> 04:45.919
or piercing, because
I'm afraid of needles.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.921
And... needles.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.392
Oh.

04:51.425 --> 04:54.061
I know what we're doing.

04:54.094 --> 04:55.996
Not hot. Gross.

04:56.029 --> 04:58.499
Smoking. Naked.

04:58.532 --> 04:59.700
Guy with a tiger?

04:59.733 --> 05:00.934
No. Come on.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.670
I have standards.

05:02.703 --> 05:04.672
Cartoon pic. Dead.

05:04.705 --> 05:07.408
Weird choice.
Oh, my God,
is he actually dead?

05:07.441 --> 05:08.542
I think so.

05:08.576 --> 05:10.411
Yeah, I mean,
I did Tinder in New York.

05:10.444 --> 05:13.781
And I got to say, I went
on some, like, skeevy-ass dates.

05:13.814 --> 05:14.815
Well, you shouldn't
use it for dates.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.684
You should use it for sex.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.852
You're looking for someone to,
like, pound the bad feelings

05:18.886 --> 05:20.120
out of you.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.823
Oh. Okay.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.124
Yeah, hot.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.927
Yeah.
Okay, so this guy can meet
you at a bar in 20 minutes.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.830
That's fast!
Mm-hmm.

05:29.863 --> 05:31.865
Technology.
Oh, my God.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.434
Okay.
Yeah.

05:33.467 --> 05:34.768
Tell him yes.
Yeah.
Okay.

05:34.802 --> 05:36.637
What's his last name?
It doesn't matter. Okay,

05:36.670 --> 05:38.839
can you come with me?
Because I'm scared.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.874
Okay.

05:40.908 --> 05:42.142
I'm gonna go put on a thong.

05:42.175 --> 05:45.012
Or maybe I won't wear
any underwear,

05:45.045 --> 05:46.380
and that way he'll...
(sniffing)

05:46.414 --> 05:47.715
he'll just, like,
smell my pheromones.

05:47.748 --> 05:50.117
Like a lion. Right?

05:50.150 --> 05:51.652
Yeah, I would do a thong.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.954
Okay.

05:53.987 --> 05:55.989
*

05:59.059 --> 06:00.494
There he is.

06:00.528 --> 06:03.497
Go for it.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.801
Hi.

06:07.835 --> 06:09.002
Jason?

06:09.036 --> 06:10.137
I'm Rebecca.

06:10.170 --> 06:12.172
Hi.
Oh, what are those?

06:12.205 --> 06:13.874
Oh, carpal tunnel.

06:13.907 --> 06:15.509
Oh. Desk job?

06:15.543 --> 06:17.044
Nah. Call of Duty: Black Ops 3.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.446
You should check out
my YouTube channel.

06:18.479 --> 06:19.580
So, uh,

06:19.613 --> 06:20.648
what's your beer of choice?

06:23.817 --> 06:26.654
Is this okay? Do you
consent to this activity?

06:26.687 --> 06:27.655
Yeah.

06:27.688 --> 06:28.656
Come on.

06:28.689 --> 06:29.657
Great.

06:35.663 --> 06:37.498
Subject demonstrates lack
of judgment

06:37.531 --> 06:39.933
combined
with poor impulse control.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.402
Do you want to get weird?

06:45.072 --> 06:47.074
*

06:48.075 --> 06:50.077
My ball.

06:52.179 --> 06:53.614
Leave it.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.148
*

07:04.658 --> 07:06.960
* Steppin' in the club,
all those eyes on me *

07:06.994 --> 07:08.862
* But there's only one pair
that I see *

07:08.896 --> 07:11.899
* He got a tight-ass bod,
big brown eyes *

07:11.932 --> 07:14.067
* Come on, cutie,
get between my thighs *

07:14.101 --> 07:16.670
* 'Cause I...

07:16.704 --> 07:19.773
* I don't even know your name

07:19.807 --> 07:21.809
It's, uh, Jason, remember?
Shh. Don't tell
me, don't tell me.

07:23.677 --> 07:28.649
* Why don't we just call
each other "baby"? *

07:28.682 --> 07:30.684
* It'll be simpler

07:30.718 --> 07:32.986
* Hey, sexy stranger,
come back to my place *

07:33.020 --> 07:35.523
* And I hope
you're not a murderer *

07:35.556 --> 07:38.091
* Kiss me, baby,
all over the place *

07:38.125 --> 07:40.494
* And please don't be
a murderer *

07:40.528 --> 07:42.830
* Please don't be a murderer

07:42.863 --> 07:45.533
* Pl-Please don't be
a murderer *

07:45.566 --> 07:47.701
* I'm sorry, I'll stop talking
'bout the murderer thing *

07:47.735 --> 07:49.937
* Let me get back to playin'
with your thing *

07:49.970 --> 07:52.239
* You got a beautiful ass,
strong-ass arms *

07:52.272 --> 07:54.842
* Is that a gun? Oh, thank God,
it's just your penis *

07:54.875 --> 07:57.244
* Have...

07:57.277 --> 08:00.581
* You been tested for STDs?

08:00.614 --> 08:02.650
* STDs *
* Tell me, please

08:02.683 --> 08:04.652
* STDs *

08:04.685 --> 08:07.120
* Then...

08:07.154 --> 08:09.590
* Waited the three-month window
and got *

08:09.623 --> 08:11.592
* Tested again?
Just makin' sure *

08:11.625 --> 08:14.294
* Most people don't know
about the window *

08:14.327 --> 08:16.229
* Hey, sexy stranger,
let's go to my place *

08:16.263 --> 08:18.999
* And please don't harvest
my kidney *

08:19.032 --> 08:21.001
* Don't give me
that incredulous face *

08:21.034 --> 08:23.604
* I saw a movie
like that on Lifetime *

08:23.637 --> 08:25.673
* Uh, your balls smell weird

08:25.706 --> 08:28.108
* Your balls smell so much worse
than I feared *

08:28.141 --> 08:30.878
* You haven't aired out
those balls in hours *

08:30.911 --> 08:33.179
* Please go wash your balls
in the shower, the bathroom *

08:33.212 --> 08:35.749
* Is right down the hall,
okay? *
* Okay *

08:35.783 --> 08:38.284
* Please don't steal anything
on the way *
* Don't steal *

08:38.318 --> 08:40.621
* Hey, sexy stranger,
I'll be right back *

08:40.654 --> 08:42.890
* I just forgot
to do the dishes *

08:42.923 --> 08:45.125
* Keep yourself horny,
stay in the mood. *

08:45.158 --> 08:48.161
I promise I'll be back.
Okay, see you in a second. Bye.

08:49.797 --> 08:52.165
(sputters)

08:54.001 --> 08:55.636
JASON:
Hello?

08:55.669 --> 08:57.304
So, we doing
this or what?

08:57.337 --> 08:59.106
Yeah! I'll be right back!

08:59.139 --> 09:01.008
Uh, stay naked!

09:01.041 --> 09:02.910
What? What am I doing?

09:02.943 --> 09:06.714
WOMAN:
Do you feel disgusted and uneasy

09:06.747 --> 09:09.282
with your current butter?
Ask yourself,

09:09.316 --> 09:12.653
are you making healthy choices?

09:12.686 --> 09:16.189
It's never too late
to get the life

09:16.223 --> 09:18.926
and the butter you deserve.

09:18.959 --> 09:21.061
What are you doing?

09:21.094 --> 09:24.598
Oh, I get it. You want to
watch TV while we're doing it.

09:24.632 --> 09:26.667
That's hot. That actually
helps me last longer.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.702
Good idea.

09:30.971 --> 09:32.940
Hey. Hey.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.675
Listen, um,

09:34.708 --> 09:36.810
you're a really great guy,

09:36.844 --> 09:38.712
and I really

09:38.746 --> 09:41.815
admire your commitment to the
health of your wrist tendons.

09:42.983 --> 09:43.817
I'm talking about the balls.
The balls

09:43.851 --> 09:44.852
that you have.
Oh.

09:44.885 --> 09:48.255
But... I got to say no.

09:48.288 --> 09:50.958
Yeah. It's not you,
it's not you. You're...

09:50.991 --> 09:54.227
fine. In-in another context,
you'd be great. But...

09:54.261 --> 09:57.397
I think that it's time for me to
start making healthier choices.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.667
And...

09:59.700 --> 10:02.102
you're not a healthy choice.

10:02.135 --> 10:05.338
So... get out of my house?

10:05.372 --> 10:06.239
(chuckles)

10:06.273 --> 10:07.908
Get out of my house.

10:11.411 --> 10:12.612
(exhales)

10:19.052 --> 10:20.788
(slurping)

10:20.821 --> 10:23.190
Mmm.

10:23.223 --> 10:24.958
The hell is that?

10:24.992 --> 10:27.060
Oh, this? I have decided

10:27.094 --> 10:29.029
to turn over a whole new leaf.

10:29.062 --> 10:31.231
Is that what that is? Really?
It's, like, leaf juice?

10:31.264 --> 10:34.868
You put, like, leaves in
a juicer and you... made that?

10:34.902 --> 10:37.404
No. So, I have come
to the decision

10:37.437 --> 10:39.439
that I need to be making
healthier choices,
Mm-hmm.

10:39.472 --> 10:42.075
so I stayed up all night
last night

10:42.109 --> 10:43.711
and I did
some research.

10:43.744 --> 10:46.714
And now I'm into, like,
all the good stuff.

10:46.747 --> 10:50.751
We're talking, like, kabbalah,
bee pollen, colonics.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.285
Oh... Mm.
Mm-hmm. Let's
see. I learned

10:52.319 --> 10:53.721
a ton about Buddhism.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.022
Uh-huh.

10:55.055 --> 10:58.225
And, oh, I'm a vegan now.

10:58.258 --> 11:01.795
Oh, uh, uh...
(chuckles)

11:01.829 --> 11:04.732
Are those the s'mores ones?
(sniffing)
Ugh.

11:04.765 --> 11:06.433
Mmm.

11:06.466 --> 11:08.168
Oh, just eat it.

11:08.201 --> 11:09.336
Life is too short.

11:09.369 --> 11:10.938
You're being ridiculous.

11:10.971 --> 11:11.872
No...
No, I know.

11:11.905 --> 11:14.074
I have turned over
enough leaves in my life

11:14.107 --> 11:15.943
for a whole forest.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.245
Eat the donut.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.446
No!
Eat it.

11:19.479 --> 11:21.048
No, you eat the donut.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.917
I made a deal with myself.

11:23.951 --> 11:25.786
CHRIS:
 We made a deal.

11:25.819 --> 11:28.255
You were gonna ask out Rebecca
and I was gonna ask out Olivia.

11:28.288 --> 11:32.059
And I held up my end
of the bargain, like a man.

11:32.092 --> 11:34.027
And how did that work out?

11:34.061 --> 11:35.362
Well, she didn't really answer.

11:35.395 --> 11:38.231
She just made this, like,
choking-laugh sound.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.934
I think she has asthma.

11:40.968 --> 11:42.803
But at least
I had the guts

11:42.836 --> 11:44.204
to ask a girl out.

11:44.237 --> 11:45.472
What's your deal with Rebecca?

11:45.505 --> 11:47.207
Either do it or don't do it.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.976
Man, you're like
a broken record.

11:49.009 --> 11:52.045
Dude, I don't even know
what a record is.

11:52.079 --> 11:53.947
You don't understand.

11:53.981 --> 11:55.749
You're too young.

11:55.783 --> 11:59.052
I like Rebecca but I don't...
like Rebecca.

11:59.086 --> 12:02.790
I have very positive feelings
of attraction towards her

12:02.823 --> 12:05.458
but I also kinda want
to punch her in the arm.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.795
You just described fifth grade.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.362
She likes someone else, okay?

12:09.396 --> 12:11.965
I know that for a fact.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.333
I mean, I know it...

12:13.366 --> 12:15.135
I don't-I don't know it.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.104
CHRIS: What?
GREG: Never mind.

12:17.137 --> 12:18.471
Hey.

12:18.505 --> 12:21.041
Chan-man.
Saw those, uh, pics

12:21.074 --> 12:22.209
on Instagram.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.277
Looked like outtakes
from a porn shoot.

12:24.311 --> 12:25.846
(laughs):
Thanks.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.114
So the trip was good?

12:27.147 --> 12:29.182
Yeah, but I maxed out
my credit card.

12:29.216 --> 12:31.218
If I don't get a job soon,

12:31.251 --> 12:32.519
I'll have to work
at my dad's radiology lab

12:32.552 --> 12:35.956
which is like all cancer,
all the time.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.257
I gotta do something else.

12:37.290 --> 12:38.491
I mean, I'll take anything.

12:38.525 --> 12:40.160
Hey, I can ask Kevin
if we're hiring here.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.428
Oh, God, no.

12:41.461 --> 12:42.863
Are you kidding me?

12:42.896 --> 12:44.297
I'm haven't completely
given up.

12:44.331 --> 12:45.966
Nice.

12:45.999 --> 12:48.435
You may need to take a trip
to your happy place.

12:48.468 --> 12:50.103
Are you guys talking
about drugs?

12:50.137 --> 12:51.438
Because drugs are bad.

12:51.471 --> 12:52.539
My cousin
tried bath salts

12:52.572 --> 12:54.407
and she ate off her own lips.

12:54.441 --> 12:55.408
No.

12:55.442 --> 12:58.311
When he's sad,
Josh likes to go to the Aloha

12:58.345 --> 13:00.247
Tech Center over
on South Cameron.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.015
Me, too.

13:02.049 --> 13:03.383
Yeah, I like to check out
the latest tech,

13:03.416 --> 13:05.318
and play a few new video games

13:05.352 --> 13:07.187
and somehow everything is okay.

13:07.220 --> 13:10.457
My life goes back
into high-def.

13:11.491 --> 13:12.926
Look who's about to come in.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.898
You gonna do it?
You gonna ask her out?

13:17.931 --> 13:20.233
Wait, you're going
to ask out Rebecca?

13:20.267 --> 13:21.969
CHRIS:
Ah, he's not gonna do it.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.303
You know how he gets.

13:25.939 --> 13:26.473
Do it, Serrano.

13:30.077 --> 13:31.578
Hi, Josh.

13:31.611 --> 13:33.981
How was your
Temecula vacay?

13:34.014 --> 13:35.515
Perfection, all around.

13:35.548 --> 13:37.851
Wonderful.

13:37.885 --> 13:39.152
The pictures on Instagram

13:39.186 --> 13:40.620
accurately represented
that fact.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.122
GREG (Irish accent):
What are you drinking,

13:42.155 --> 13:43.556
leprechaun blood?

13:46.659 --> 13:49.396
No. Um, I'm actually

13:49.429 --> 13:51.431
a vegan now. Yeah.
Really?

13:51.464 --> 13:54.868
Since four days ago when I saw
you house a cheeseburger pizza?

13:54.902 --> 13:56.269
That was the old me.

13:56.303 --> 13:59.072
The new me is making
healthier choices.

13:59.106 --> 14:01.274
You sound like
that weird butter commercial.

14:01.308 --> 14:03.376
Thank you.

14:03.410 --> 14:05.245
Mmm, this juice
is really starting to work,

14:05.278 --> 14:08.615
so I'm going
to hit the ladies.

14:08.648 --> 14:10.617
Room. Hit the ladies' room.

14:10.650 --> 14:13.020
I'm not a football player.
(laughs)

14:14.321 --> 14:15.522
Do you hear that?

14:15.555 --> 14:17.524
Healthy choices--
that's you.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.128
That one was a false alarm.

14:21.161 --> 14:23.263
Hey, can I talk to you
over here for a sec?

14:23.296 --> 14:25.232
Yeah, can't we just
talk over here?

14:25.265 --> 14:26.499
Nah, let's leave the children
out of this.

14:26.533 --> 14:29.369
So, um, healthy choices.

14:29.402 --> 14:32.105
Yeah.
That applies to your
dating life, too,

14:32.139 --> 14:33.406
don't you think?

14:33.440 --> 14:35.375
Yeah, like, I think I really
need to be with, like,

14:35.408 --> 14:36.910
an older guy,
maybe like a professor,

14:36.944 --> 14:38.979
or maybe like...

14:39.012 --> 14:40.313
(quietly):
Oh.

14:41.448 --> 14:43.583
Wait.

14:43.616 --> 14:45.652
Are you...
are you really doing this?

14:45.685 --> 14:48.288
Yeah. So, I still like you,
Yeah, okay.

14:48.321 --> 14:49.489
and I know I shouldn't.

14:49.522 --> 14:50.690
I don't want to.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.525
You're not that nice
to me and you're weird.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.995
And I tell myself to stop
thinking about you,

14:55.028 --> 14:58.065
but every time you show up,

14:58.098 --> 15:01.134
it's like boom, feelings.

15:01.168 --> 15:02.936
And I know also

15:02.970 --> 15:03.971
that you have feelings
for Josh...

15:04.004 --> 15:05.672
No, I don't have feelings...
No, no, no, no, no.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.274
No, I-I don't, I don't
have feelings...
No, no, shh.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.242
Just listen.
Just-just listen.
Josh?

15:09.276 --> 15:11.945
Okay.

15:15.282 --> 15:18.952
* When we're together

15:18.986 --> 15:22.122
* I feel so grand

15:22.155 --> 15:25.425
* My heart goes
tippety-tap-tap-tap *

15:25.458 --> 15:28.328
* When I hold your hand

15:28.361 --> 15:31.264
* But I know
there's another guy *

15:31.298 --> 15:34.167
* You fancy more

15:34.201 --> 15:37.137
* So even though

15:37.170 --> 15:40.640
* I'm not the one you adore

15:40.673 --> 15:43.310
* Why... not

15:43.343 --> 15:44.477
(snaps fingers)

15:44.511 --> 15:46.546
* Settle for me

15:46.579 --> 15:49.182
* Darling, just settle for me

15:49.216 --> 15:52.419
* I think
you'll have to agree *

15:52.452 --> 15:56.056
* We make quite a pair

15:57.324 --> 16:03.063
* I know I'm only second place
in this game *

16:03.096 --> 16:05.732
* But like 2% milk
or seitan beef *

16:05.765 --> 16:08.601
* I almost taste the same

16:08.635 --> 16:11.471
(clattering)
* So won't you

16:11.504 --> 16:13.073
* Settle for me

16:13.106 --> 16:15.675
* Come on and settle for me

16:15.708 --> 16:18.045
* Say yes or no

16:18.078 --> 16:21.781
* Before I choke
on all this swallowed pride *

16:21.814 --> 16:24.784
* I have no problem being
picked out from the bottom *

16:24.817 --> 16:28.755
* If he's your broken condom,
I'm plan B *

16:28.788 --> 16:31.491
* So lower those expectations

16:31.524 --> 16:33.360
* And settle for me

16:33.393 --> 16:35.062
* Am I okay with this?

16:35.095 --> 16:36.229
* Totally

16:36.263 --> 16:38.631
Oh, sweet, a gown.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.433
* Settle for me

16:40.467 --> 16:43.170
* Babycakes,
just settle for me *

16:43.203 --> 16:46.073
* Schmoopy pie,
I'm begging you, please *

16:46.106 --> 16:50.110
* Can't you see the light?

16:50.143 --> 16:53.513
* Sugar jugs, I'm so bereft

16:53.546 --> 16:56.683
* Demeaning terms are all
that I have left *

16:56.716 --> 16:58.818
* Of my masculinity

16:58.851 --> 17:01.754
* So settle for me

17:01.788 --> 17:04.391
So twirly.

17:04.424 --> 17:06.059
*

17:06.093 --> 17:08.328
* Little girl

17:08.361 --> 17:12.065
* Don't make me feel like
a little girl *

17:12.098 --> 17:14.401
* Exposed and raw

17:14.434 --> 17:17.436
* Whose boobs can't even fill
a training bra *

17:18.438 --> 17:20.073
* Let's pretend
I didn't say that *

17:20.107 --> 17:21.540
* Settle for me

17:21.574 --> 17:23.175
* It's a practical proposal

17:23.210 --> 17:24.544
* Settle for me

17:24.577 --> 17:26.246
* It makes a certain sense

17:26.279 --> 17:27.579
* He's a fantasy

17:27.614 --> 17:31.251
* But hey,
let's think this through *

17:32.285 --> 17:33.820
* Yes, Josh is a dream

17:33.853 --> 17:35.422
* But I'm right here

17:35.455 --> 17:38.425
* In flesh and blood
and self-hate *

17:38.458 --> 17:39.759
BOTH:
* Settle for me

17:39.792 --> 17:42.762
* In a sad way,
darling, it's fate *

17:42.795 --> 17:44.764
*

18:07.620 --> 18:09.289
* You're like Rocky V to Rocky

18:09.322 --> 18:11.191
* Solange to Beyoncé

18:11.224 --> 18:13.693
* Not asking to be your fiancé

18:13.726 --> 18:15.595
* But if tonight,
or tomorrow *

18:15.628 --> 18:17.264
* If you happen to be free

18:17.297 --> 18:23.470
* Maybe, just maybe,
settle for me... *

18:23.503 --> 18:24.737
(song ends)

18:24.771 --> 18:26.673
So what'll it be?

18:26.706 --> 18:28.475
Can you hurry up
and decide?

18:28.508 --> 18:30.743
A dip is kinda supposed
to be a quick thing.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.780
Uh...

18:40.720 --> 18:42.722
(Hawaiian music playing)

18:50.930 --> 18:52.899
Aloha.

18:52.932 --> 18:54.301
Would you like some poké?

18:54.334 --> 18:55.868
Are you kidding?
I would love some poké.

18:57.870 --> 19:00.540
Mm. Anything new today?

19:00.573 --> 19:03.576
We got Murder Rampage III:

19:03.610 --> 19:05.212
A Quest for Chaos.

19:05.245 --> 19:07.880
The DPS is out of control.

19:07.914 --> 19:09.249
Really?

19:09.282 --> 19:11.618
God, I love this place.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.295
Hey, I wanted to talk to you
about the Caswick case.

19:22.329 --> 19:24.731
What the hell is this?

19:24.764 --> 19:27.267
Well, I was reading that sitting
is like the new smoking--

19:27.300 --> 19:29.602
I know-- you should be walking
ten miles a day,

19:29.636 --> 19:30.937
so I got this treadmill desk

19:30.970 --> 19:32.472
but then I realized

19:32.505 --> 19:34.441
I couldn't really
do work on it.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.643
Um, and also I hate walking.

19:36.676 --> 19:39.812
So that-that-that was what,
that was like a $2,000 mistake?

19:39.846 --> 19:42.615
Let me save you
from making another one.

19:42.649 --> 19:44.551
Don't go out with Greg.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.519
Can you stop telling me
what to do. Okay?

19:46.553 --> 19:48.755
I'm... I haven't decided what
I'm going to do about Greg.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.790
All I'm saying is, if you go
out with Josh's best friend,

19:50.823 --> 19:52.525
you activate the bro code

19:52.559 --> 19:55.562
and then you muddy up
the long play for Josh.

19:55.595 --> 19:58.298
What I do with Greg has
nothing to do with...

19:58.331 --> 19:59.666
Josh.
Exactly.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.668
No, actually, Josh is actually
right out here.

20:03.270 --> 20:04.404
Great, send him in.
Oh.

20:04.437 --> 20:05.505
It's for business.
I told him to come.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.540
Uh, okay.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.912
This is the greatest thing
I've ever experienced.

20:12.945 --> 20:15.315
What do you log on
this thing, like, ten,

20:15.348 --> 20:16.516
20 miles a day?

20:16.549 --> 20:18.585
Yeah, in that area.

20:18.618 --> 20:19.986
So what can I help you with?

20:20.019 --> 20:21.087
Oh, I need you to look at this.

20:21.120 --> 20:24.524
So, I'm applying to the
place I most want to work

20:24.557 --> 20:26.726
like, in the whole world but I'm
no good at job applications.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.461
So confusing.

20:28.495 --> 20:29.996
There's like a blank space
for an essay or something?

20:30.029 --> 20:31.531
Like, what do I write there?
Ooh.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.933
Let's take a look-see at this.

20:33.966 --> 20:35.935
For the Aloha Tech Center.

20:35.968 --> 20:38.338
Oh, that's like the Hawaiian
place with the TVs, right?

20:38.371 --> 20:40.540
Yeah, you know what. Let me
make take care of the essay.

20:40.573 --> 20:41.941
I got it.

20:41.974 --> 20:43.810
Oh, so I never heard,

20:43.843 --> 20:45.712
what's happening with
you and Serrano?

20:45.745 --> 20:46.946
You gonna go out with him?

20:46.979 --> 20:50.550
Oh, um, I'm still
thinking about it.

20:50.583 --> 20:53.520
Tell you what, you're helping
me with my job application,

20:53.553 --> 20:55.488
I'll help you with
your love life.

20:55.522 --> 20:56.989
(laughing):
Are you like a love doctor?

20:57.890 --> 21:00.360
And this puppy is...

21:00.393 --> 21:01.961
ready to ship.

21:01.994 --> 21:03.863
Thanks.
So, um,

21:03.896 --> 21:06.633
you mentioned, uh, helping me
with my love life.
Oh.

21:06.666 --> 21:08.468
Well, that's easy one.
I think you should...

21:08.501 --> 21:10.603
Hold out for something
more magical, right?

21:10.637 --> 21:13.373
I should just wait
for that special someone?

21:13.406 --> 21:15.375
No, I-I think
you should say yes.

21:15.408 --> 21:17.009
Oh. Oh, okay.

21:17.043 --> 21:18.878
You... okay. You do?

21:18.911 --> 21:20.513
Why not? Greg's the coolest.

21:20.547 --> 21:21.481
I say, go for it.

21:21.514 --> 21:23.550
So... so you think
I should-I should date Greg?

21:23.583 --> 21:25.452
I think I just said that.

21:25.485 --> 21:26.753
You just, you don't think
there's like

21:26.786 --> 21:28.321
any reason
that I shouldn't?

21:28.355 --> 21:32.325
Any... reason at all?

21:32.359 --> 21:35.328
Not that I can think of.

21:35.362 --> 21:36.829
Nope. Nothing.
Well, I should run.

21:36.863 --> 21:38.998
Um, I gotta get this
in to Aloha.

21:39.031 --> 21:40.667
Thank you so much.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.602
Oh, thank...
Good luck!

21:44.604 --> 21:46.506
(sighs)
Okay.

21:46.539 --> 21:47.674
Healthy choices.

21:47.707 --> 21:49.409
Hmm.

21:49.442 --> 21:52.345
(touch-tones beeping)

21:52.379 --> 21:55.348
Hello, Greg? Yes.

21:55.382 --> 21:56.549
(sighs)

21:56.583 --> 21:57.717
WOMAN:
 Make an effort,

21:57.750 --> 21:58.885
make a decision.

21:58.918 --> 22:01.788
Your future is in your hands

22:01.821 --> 22:03.856
and on the edge of your knife.

22:03.890 --> 22:05.892
*

22:11.998 --> 22:14.033
Everything okay with the...

22:14.066 --> 22:16.135
application there, sir?
(chuckles quietly)

22:16.168 --> 22:18.805
I don't know.
I think you're overqualified.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.473
(sputters, laughs)

22:20.507 --> 22:21.908
What?

22:21.941 --> 22:24.544
No. Like... Wh-What?
What do you mean?

22:24.577 --> 22:27.447
This essay you wrote at the end
of your application, it's...

22:27.480 --> 22:29.015
quite a piece of writing.

22:29.048 --> 22:30.550
And that's bad?

22:30.583 --> 22:32.552
Well, it's just so intellectual
and overthought.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.687
You reference Kafka in it.

22:34.721 --> 22:37.056
It's, like, what, did you go
to Harvard or something?

22:37.089 --> 22:39.592
No, no. I-I-I went...
I went to Northridge.

22:39.626 --> 22:41.794
A-And barely. Like, I
never went to class.

22:41.828 --> 22:45.131
I just mean that at no point
do you even mention electronics

22:45.164 --> 22:47.967
or being into electronics, and
this is an electronics store,

22:48.000 --> 22:50.403
so that would be huge.

22:50.437 --> 22:51.771
So, I don't know, maybe,

22:51.804 --> 22:54.674
uh, maybe you
should work in a place that...

22:54.707 --> 22:56.709
sells books instead of gear.

22:56.743 --> 22:59.045
Guess that would be a...
library.

22:59.078 --> 23:00.713
No...

23:00.747 --> 23:02.148
Hey, look, bro...

23:02.181 --> 23:06.519
Aloha is just a...
really laid-back store, okay?

23:06.553 --> 23:08.755
And our employees
are just chill.

23:08.788 --> 23:11.691
So... someone
who gets this upset

23:11.724 --> 23:13.960
about Harper Lee and...

23:13.993 --> 23:17.630
you know, whether the book
was a prequel or first draft

23:17.664 --> 23:19.198
does not sound chill.

23:19.231 --> 23:22.602
No, no. I-I'm chill. I'm,
like, I'm, like, so chill!

23:22.635 --> 23:24.837
Uh, you know, the whole
Harper Lee thing,

23:24.871 --> 23:28.074
that was just 'cause I love her
husband-- you know, Bruce Lee.

23:28.107 --> 23:29.308
I just think...

23:29.341 --> 23:33.680
based on this essay, you're
not gonna be very happy here.

23:40.653 --> 23:43.723
Ta-da! The West Covina
Taco Festival.

23:43.756 --> 23:47.093
The second best thing to do
in this town besides leave.

23:47.126 --> 23:49.596
I saw flyers for this
at City Hall.

23:49.629 --> 23:52.599
This is so cool.
But what if it rains again?
With my luck,

23:52.632 --> 23:54.834
it probably will, because
when I plan an outdoor date,

23:54.867 --> 23:58.671
it's the one rainy day in the
middle of a five-year drought.

24:00.940 --> 24:04.076
So, Gregory...

24:04.110 --> 24:06.779
we are on a date.

24:06.813 --> 24:09.148
Yes, we are.
Yes. Okay.

24:10.883 --> 24:14.854
Let's engage in some
date... conversation.

24:14.887 --> 24:17.123
Okay.

24:17.156 --> 24:20.026
Who is your
favorite president?

24:20.059 --> 24:22.128
Mine is
Rutherford B. Hayes,

24:22.161 --> 24:24.163
for obvious reasons.

24:25.164 --> 24:27.199
Have you been on
a date before?

24:27.233 --> 24:29.869
I have. I'm just...
I'm just trying to be mature

24:29.902 --> 24:32.138
and responsible... Pork!

24:33.139 --> 24:34.874
That took a turn.

24:34.907 --> 24:37.076
You want one?

24:37.109 --> 24:38.878
No. No.

24:38.911 --> 24:41.848
Uh-uh. Don't try to trick
me, because I'm a vegan.

24:41.881 --> 24:42.982
This week you are.

24:43.015 --> 24:45.284
For forever I am.
Okay.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.654
So... I will have...

24:47.687 --> 24:49.288
mmm, the cauliflower tacos.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.290
(groans): Ooh. You are
really sticking to this.

24:51.323 --> 24:52.992
Yep. I'm trying to fight
my base urges.

24:53.025 --> 24:56.896
(sighs) Just what a guy wants
to hear on a date.

24:56.929 --> 24:58.030
Wow.

24:58.064 --> 24:59.866
Mmm!

24:59.899 --> 25:02.301
Wait. This is
actually really good.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.103
Oh, no, no.
Try some.

25:04.136 --> 25:06.706
I don't do cauliflower--
they're like albino broccoli.

25:06.739 --> 25:08.240
Try me, Greg. Try me.
Okay. Okay.

25:08.274 --> 25:09.576
They can't talk.

25:11.944 --> 25:13.245
You know what?

25:13.279 --> 25:15.648
This is pretty... disgusting.

25:15.682 --> 25:16.783
Mm.

25:16.816 --> 25:17.917
Mm, garbage can.

25:17.950 --> 25:18.751
So funny.

25:18.785 --> 25:21.087
(thunder rumbling)
Hmm, let's see,

25:21.120 --> 25:24.190
little known facts
about me.

25:24.223 --> 25:26.058
(laughs):
Uh... oh, okay.

25:26.092 --> 25:28.828
So, once a week
I Google trivia

25:28.861 --> 25:31.063
about the Triangle
Shirtwaist Factory fire.

25:31.097 --> 25:32.732
Shut up.
I love that fire.

25:32.765 --> 25:34.166
That's, like,
my favorite fire.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.735
(laughing): No.
Stop messing with me.

25:35.768 --> 25:38.037
I know it's weird.
Why is it weird
to be obsessed

25:38.070 --> 25:40.339
with the flash point
that single-handedly
ignited labor reform

25:40.372 --> 25:43.075
in the U.S.?

25:43.109 --> 25:45.845
Speaking of flash point, you're
blowing my mind right now.

25:46.846 --> 25:48.114
Stick around.

25:48.147 --> 25:51.618
Every year
after my dad my left,

25:51.651 --> 25:54.854
on his birthday
I... I'd send him, like,

25:54.887 --> 25:57.223
(laughs)
like, a handmade card

25:57.256 --> 26:01.227
with these terrible, like,
terrible stick-figure drawings

26:01.260 --> 26:03.830
and a ton of glitter.

26:03.863 --> 26:07.767
And every year, I
would never hear back.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.102
Your dad's an idiot.

26:10.136 --> 26:12.972
I mean... to be fair,
glitter gets everywhere.

26:13.005 --> 26:15.975
Well, it sounded like
he was a crappy father--
he deserved glitter.

26:16.008 --> 26:17.744
I'd throw glitter
at him right now.

26:17.777 --> 26:19.378
Is there a glitter stand
here somewhere?

26:19.411 --> 26:21.614
Can we get some glitter
over here?

26:21.648 --> 26:23.315
I don't want to talk
about it anymore, Dad.

26:23.349 --> 26:26.318
So you didn't get the job--
thank goodness.

26:26.352 --> 26:29.856
It's a silly place,
with the shirts and the...

26:29.889 --> 26:31.791
and the raw fish.

26:31.824 --> 26:35.061
This place is
the right choice for you.

26:35.094 --> 26:37.229
The most
healthy thing.

26:37.263 --> 26:40.700
Now, put on all these layers
so you don't get cancer.

26:40.733 --> 26:42.702
Hmm?

26:42.735 --> 26:46.238
* Ay, ay, ay, ay

26:46.272 --> 26:49.776
* Canta y no llores

26:49.809 --> 26:52.144
* Porque cantando se alegran
(grunts)

26:52.178 --> 26:54.714
* Cielito lindo
Ha-ha!

26:54.747 --> 26:57.216
* Los corazones

26:57.249 --> 27:01.287
* Ay, ay, ay, ay

27:01.320 --> 27:04.857
* Canta y no llores

27:04.891 --> 27:06.392
* Porque cantando

27:06.425 --> 27:07.860
* Se alegran

27:07.894 --> 27:10.229
* Cielito lindo...

27:10.262 --> 27:11.898
(music pauses)

27:11.931 --> 27:16.368
* Los corazo... nes...

27:16.402 --> 27:18.738
(trumpets play closing phrase)

27:18.771 --> 27:20.106
(people cheering)

27:20.139 --> 27:21.908
All right.

27:21.941 --> 27:24.443
Okay, everybody, the final round

27:24.476 --> 27:26.746
of the guacamole contest
will begin

27:26.779 --> 27:29.448
in one minute
in the gazebo!
Oh...!

27:29.481 --> 27:31.183
Ooh, guacamole!

27:31.217 --> 27:34.186
Uh, we could go,
or we could go...

27:34.220 --> 27:35.421
someplace else.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.190
Maybe your place?

27:38.224 --> 27:40.793
Um, no, uh, my place...

27:40.827 --> 27:42.194
my place sounds great.

27:42.228 --> 27:44.063
Great.

27:44.096 --> 27:47.366
But let's go
to the guacamole contest first.

27:47.399 --> 27:50.469
Just for, like, five minutes,
'cause I want to see

27:50.502 --> 27:54.006
who has the best guacamole.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.775
Please?
Sure. Yeah.

27:55.808 --> 27:57.409
You won't regret it.
* I won't regret it.

27:57.443 --> 27:59.111
We're gonna get that
tum-tum full of guacamole.

27:59.145 --> 28:02.081
* I... love avocados!

28:02.114 --> 28:03.816
MAN (over speakers):
You've been voting all day,

28:03.850 --> 28:05.818
and we are down
to two finalists.

28:05.852 --> 28:08.020
Local West Covina favorite,

28:08.054 --> 28:09.388
La Cocina...!

28:09.421 --> 28:11.390
(whooping, cheering)

28:11.423 --> 28:14.393
And all the way from Echo Park,

28:14.426 --> 28:17.764
also known as the Brooklyn
of Southern California...

28:17.797 --> 28:20.332
Echo Parko Tacos...!

28:20.366 --> 28:22.969
(people jeering)

28:23.002 --> 28:26.906
Grab some guac, have a taste,
and place your votes.

28:26.939 --> 28:28.240
REBECCA:
Okay,

28:28.274 --> 28:30.176
so I'll hit the hipsters,
you hit the abuela.

28:30.209 --> 28:32.044
Deal.
Great.

28:32.078 --> 28:33.245
Hey, is this vegan?

28:33.279 --> 28:34.446
Yeah. Certified organic.

28:34.480 --> 28:37.116
No GMOs. Avocados
are even cruelty-free.

28:37.149 --> 28:39.385
Okay. Save the avocados.

28:39.418 --> 28:40.920
So you're a vegan?

28:40.953 --> 28:42.454
I'm a vegan, too.
Of course.

28:42.488 --> 28:43.990
Cool. Yeah, I just realized

28:44.023 --> 28:45.958
it's, like, a lifestyle choice,
you know?
Yeah.

28:45.992 --> 28:48.961
It's... it's really changed
the way I do everything

28:48.995 --> 28:50.997
in the last... two days.

28:51.030 --> 28:52.799
Although,
truth be told,

28:52.832 --> 28:54.867
when I walk around
this festival, all I want to do

28:54.901 --> 28:56.803
is just sink my teeth
into animal flesh, you know?

28:56.836 --> 28:57.870
(chuckles)
I feel you.

28:57.904 --> 29:00.272
I could really go
for some Burger King right now.

29:00.306 --> 29:01.273
Yeah.
But don't tell anyone,
all right?

29:01.307 --> 29:03.042
That's gonna be
our little secret.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.143
Okay.

29:04.176 --> 29:06.245
GREG:
Okay, you ready?

29:06.278 --> 29:08.247
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm so excited.

29:09.381 --> 29:11.150
* Mmm, mmm, mmm...

29:11.183 --> 29:11.984
(drumming)

29:12.018 --> 29:14.020
Okay, I've got to say...

29:15.354 --> 29:17.189
...the Echo Park one is better.

29:17.223 --> 29:19.859
The hipster one?
Are you crazy?
Yeah.

29:19.892 --> 29:21.393
Abuela's one is
so much better.

29:21.427 --> 29:23.129
The hipster one
tastes like...

29:23.162 --> 29:25.564
soy candles
and indie bands.
No.

29:25.597 --> 29:28.835
Scoff if you want, but the
hipster one is more authentic.

29:28.868 --> 29:31.570
What?! How could
guys with man buns

29:31.603 --> 29:33.973
know what is authentic?
Okay,

29:34.006 --> 29:36.275
so Abuela' clearly had
sour cream in it,

29:36.308 --> 29:39.411
and anybo will tell you that's
not authentic Mexican guacamole.

29:39.445 --> 29:41.580
This is hilarious.
You're suddenly an expert

29:41.613 --> 29:43.082
on authentic cuisine?

29:43.115 --> 29:44.951
Is this like your
authentic veganism?

29:44.984 --> 29:46.853
What's that supposed to mean?

29:46.886 --> 29:49.822
It's very funny. It's
cute, the vegan thing.
It's cute?

29:49.856 --> 29:51.523
Thank you.
It's cute.
It's like how...

29:51.557 --> 29:53.492
you became Buddhist...

29:53.525 --> 29:54.927
like, yesterday.

29:54.961 --> 29:57.396
Okay, you're...
being really mean.

29:57.429 --> 29:59.198
You're making fun of me.
I don't like it.
Hey, what's wrong?

29:59.231 --> 30:01.333
No, nothing is wrong.
I just liked it better

30:01.367 --> 30:03.302
when you were being
a nice person.

30:03.335 --> 30:06.005
I'm just teasing you.
You can be a bit
of a hypocrite.

30:06.038 --> 30:07.206
I mean, it's...
you have to admit,

30:07.239 --> 30:10.877
you're not exactly, in general,
like, steeped in honesty.

30:10.910 --> 30:13.612
You moved to California
to be by the beach?

30:13.645 --> 30:15.581
Obviously, something happened
in New York,

30:15.614 --> 30:17.984
you had a bit
of a nervous breakdown...

30:18.017 --> 30:19.485
Okay. Okay.

30:19.518 --> 30:21.921
Okay, as long
as we're being super honest,

30:21.954 --> 30:24.056
let's talk about
when you asked me out

30:24.090 --> 30:26.859
and your whole
"settle for me" vibe.

30:26.893 --> 30:29.228
Like, it's weird and sad.

30:29.261 --> 30:31.430
Okay, well, that's
not quite how I remembered it.

30:31.463 --> 30:35.334
But the truth is, I-I don't want
you to settle for me. I...

30:35.367 --> 30:37.970
(sighs)

30:38.004 --> 30:39.138
We get each other.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.373
And we get along.

30:41.407 --> 30:42.875
Look, I'm sorry

30:42.909 --> 30:44.576
I teased you-- I will stop.

30:44.610 --> 30:47.579
Let's just go back
to having a good time, okay?

30:48.614 --> 30:50.616
Yeah, okay. Okay.

30:50.649 --> 30:52.484
I...

30:52.518 --> 30:55.254
totally overreacted, too, so...

30:55.287 --> 30:56.488
Okay, then.

30:56.522 --> 30:58.557
(sighs):
Okay.

30:58.590 --> 31:00.893
(exhales):
Oh, wow,

31:00.927 --> 31:04.263
we just, like, really worked
through something there...

31:04.296 --> 31:06.565
like adults.

31:06.598 --> 31:08.534
Like we're normal.

31:08.567 --> 31:10.669
Some may say healthy.

31:10.702 --> 31:13.039
Actually, I have to use
the bathroom really quickly,

31:13.072 --> 31:14.941
so I'm gonna go
to one of those...

31:14.974 --> 31:16.542
(whispers):
sexy Porta Potties.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.280
WOMAN (in distance):
Oh, come on!

31:26.452 --> 31:29.488
* Settle for him

31:29.521 --> 31:31.290
* Why not just

31:31.323 --> 31:34.293
* Settle for him

31:34.326 --> 31:36.662
* He's a nice, smart guy

31:36.695 --> 31:38.530
* And he and I

31:38.564 --> 31:40.967
* Do get along...

31:41.000 --> 31:42.701
(knocking)
Well, kind of.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.937
MAN:
Hey!
Just a minute.

31:44.971 --> 31:47.173
* As soon as I'm done peeing

31:47.206 --> 31:49.208
* It's time to start being

31:49.241 --> 31:51.177
* A bit more realistic

31:51.210 --> 31:52.444
* Than I've been...

31:52.478 --> 31:54.180
You can't monopolize
the bathroom

31:54.213 --> 31:56.082
at a taco festival!

31:56.115 --> 31:58.951
* Maybe it's time to grow up

31:58.985 --> 32:00.186
* And

32:00.219 --> 32:02.054
* Just settle for...

32:02.088 --> 32:03.322
(pounding)
Come on!

32:03.355 --> 32:06.358
All right, already!

32:20.706 --> 32:23.509
(sighs)

32:26.378 --> 32:28.447
(sighs)

32:33.552 --> 32:36.422
(sighs)

32:38.690 --> 32:40.692
(gasps)

32:42.761 --> 32:45.031
Hey.

32:46.032 --> 32:47.633
Mmm.

32:47.666 --> 32:49.368
(chuckles)

32:49.401 --> 32:51.470
Okay, you caught me.

32:51.503 --> 32:54.173
Don't worry.
Your secret is safe with me.

32:57.109 --> 32:59.111
(phone chimes)

33:01.547 --> 33:03.549
Are you kidding me?

33:10.556 --> 33:12.791
So, what should I do

33:12.824 --> 33:16.095
with the two condoms
that you made me wear?

33:16.128 --> 33:18.264
Uh, trash can's
in the bathroom.

33:18.297 --> 33:20.466
Cool.

33:20.499 --> 33:23.569
Hey, by the way,
you finished, right?

33:24.836 --> 33:26.805
Yeah, I finished a bunch.

33:26.838 --> 33:29.041
You're welcome.

33:29.841 --> 33:32.211
(groans)

33:32.244 --> 33:34.213
MAN:
 So,

33:34.246 --> 33:35.381
I'll call you?

33:35.414 --> 33:37.216
That's... that's okay.

33:37.249 --> 33:38.817
Text?
Uh...

33:38.850 --> 33:41.287
Find you on Facebook?

33:41.320 --> 33:43.655
Take a hint, dude.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.557
LinkedIn it is.

33:45.591 --> 33:46.825
(sighs)

33:46.858 --> 33:48.294
(door opens)

33:48.327 --> 33:50.562
(groans, door closes)

33:51.597 --> 33:53.699
(knocking)

33:53.732 --> 33:56.302
Ah, dude, nobody is on LinkedIn.

33:56.335 --> 33:59.438
Okay...?
What the hell is going on?

33:59.471 --> 34:01.473
Oh... Oh...

34:07.279 --> 34:08.580
(whimpering)

34:08.614 --> 34:11.150
A dude just left your apartment!

34:11.183 --> 34:13.152
You took some guy home

34:13.185 --> 34:14.853
from our date and

34:14.886 --> 34:17.289
slept with him?
What is wrong with you?

34:17.322 --> 34:19.791
Sorry. I-I-I... I-I don't
know... I don't know. I-I...

34:19.824 --> 34:21.592
I don't understand.

34:21.627 --> 34:23.161
No, see, that's-that's it.

34:23.195 --> 34:25.563
You don't understand.
Like, I'm not...

34:26.465 --> 34:27.498
I'm not an adult.

34:27.533 --> 34:29.235
Like what we were doing
back at the taco festival.

34:29.268 --> 34:30.735
Like, being, like, all adulty.

34:30.768 --> 34:33.605
That's just not
me, okay? Like,

34:33.639 --> 34:37.275
I take advice
from butter commercials.

34:37.309 --> 34:39.478
This makes no sense.

34:39.511 --> 34:41.847
I know, because I make no sense.
I make no sense.

34:41.880 --> 34:43.181
And you shouldn't

34:43.215 --> 34:44.315
waste time on me.

34:44.350 --> 34:47.485
Can't you see that?

34:47.518 --> 34:50.156
No, all I can see...

34:50.188 --> 34:52.324
is what
this night could have been.

34:54.326 --> 34:57.329
(sighs)

34:58.864 --> 35:00.866
(door closes)

35:13.245 --> 35:15.214
(footsteps approaching)

35:15.247 --> 35:17.749
What's up, neighbor?

35:17.783 --> 35:18.850
Come in.

35:18.884 --> 35:21.287
How's it going?
You feeling better?

35:21.320 --> 35:23.922
You're out of material
for your paper?

35:23.955 --> 35:26.525
I'm sorry.
No.

35:26.558 --> 35:27.926
It's cool. I know you're writing
a paper on me.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.261
You told me that, remember?

35:29.295 --> 35:32.364
I feel kind of bad now.

35:32.398 --> 35:33.865
Do you ever have one
of those days

35:33.899 --> 35:37.736
where you've done something
so horrible, it feels like

35:37.769 --> 35:40.339
you did it in a
dream, and you...

35:40.372 --> 35:42.341
you just want to wake up, and...

35:42.374 --> 35:45.344
you want it to be all okay,
but there's no waking up

35:45.377 --> 35:47.913
because you did it for realsies?

35:47.946 --> 35:50.316
If you want to grab

35:50.349 --> 35:52.318
your laptop
and take all this down,

35:52.351 --> 35:53.752
it's pretty fresh right now.

35:55.721 --> 35:59.558
You know what? Just... you.

35:59.591 --> 36:03.429
You get some rest... kiddo.

36:06.398 --> 36:08.934
I'm older than you.

36:21.513 --> 36:23.515
(phone chimes)

36:30.822 --> 36:33.492
What's it say?

36:33.525 --> 36:36.262
I can't tell you. The doctor
gives you the results.

36:36.295 --> 36:38.930
Please, you know
what it says.

36:38.964 --> 36:41.400
I-I can't wait any longer.

36:41.433 --> 36:43.535
All right, just-just
tell me what it says.

36:43.569 --> 36:46.438
Well...

36:46.472 --> 36:48.440
I guess I can tell you...

36:48.474 --> 36:49.808
Thanks.

36:49.841 --> 36:51.310
It's...
(phone ringing)

36:52.911 --> 36:54.546
Yello.

36:54.580 --> 36:56.448
Hi. I just saw Instagram.

36:56.482 --> 36:58.950
You're at the radiology lab?
What happened?

36:58.984 --> 37:01.287
Well, I got an interview
at the Aloha Tech Center,

37:01.320 --> 37:02.220
like you said I would,

37:02.254 --> 37:03.955
but there was a problem
with my application.

37:03.989 --> 37:05.291
What?!

37:05.324 --> 37:07.359
Cal State Northridge isn't bad.

37:07.393 --> 37:09.361
Yeah, no, it's not that.

37:09.395 --> 37:10.962
They-they just thought

37:10.996 --> 37:13.965
my additional information
was... a little...

37:13.999 --> 37:15.967
A little what?

37:16.001 --> 37:19.338
They just thought
it was a bit pretentious.

37:19.371 --> 37:20.872
Pretentious?

37:20.906 --> 37:23.375
Yeah. They asked me
if I went to Harvard,

37:23.409 --> 37:25.411
and, like, not in a good way.

37:25.444 --> 37:27.746
What other way is there?!

37:33.419 --> 37:35.454
REBECCA:
 That Harper Lee analogy

37:35.487 --> 37:38.256
was actually very
well thought-out and trenchant.

37:39.057 --> 37:40.926
And you have the nerve
to sit here

37:40.959 --> 37:43.762
and not hire this man
to hand out leis and sell VCRs?!

37:43.795 --> 37:44.896
VCRs?

37:44.930 --> 37:46.632
Lady, there's no such thing.

37:46.665 --> 37:47.966
Could you step outside?

37:47.999 --> 37:50.469
(quietly): I'm sorry.
No, I will not step outside.
Listen to me.

37:50.502 --> 37:52.504
I have to tell you something
very important.

37:52.538 --> 37:53.905
I have an IQ of 164.

37:53.939 --> 37:54.973
On the entire SAT,

37:55.006 --> 37:56.708
I got two questions wrong,
and in subsequent years,

37:56.742 --> 37:57.843
those questions were stricken

37:57.876 --> 37:59.411
for being
misleading, but

37:59.445 --> 38:03.882
I know... nothing about life.

38:03.915 --> 38:06.852
Yeah. No.

38:06.885 --> 38:09.020
Truly nothing.

38:09.054 --> 38:11.323
Like... (laughs)

38:11.357 --> 38:13.759
I make awful decisions.

38:13.792 --> 38:17.028
Like, really. No, like,
really awful decisions.

38:17.062 --> 38:18.964
I mean,

38:18.997 --> 38:20.432
I know what you're thinking.

38:20.466 --> 38:22.000
You're thinking,
"Well, are you Audra Levine?"

38:22.033 --> 38:23.502
And the answer is, Alex, no.

38:23.535 --> 38:25.371
I'm not Audra Levine, and

38:25.404 --> 38:28.039
I never will be Audra Levine,
okay?

38:28.073 --> 38:29.608
But...

38:29.641 --> 38:31.743
I do know one thing.

38:31.777 --> 38:34.646
(inhales and exhales loudly
through her nose)

38:34.680 --> 38:37.649
And... is that

38:37.683 --> 38:39.951
Josh Chan loves you.

38:41.620 --> 38:46.358
And, God, that makes you
the luckiest person...

38:46.392 --> 38:49.094
store... in the world.

38:51.029 --> 38:55.534
And hiring him would be the best
decision you've ever made.

38:55.567 --> 38:57.569
(inhales and
exhales loudly)

39:00.539 --> 39:03.409
Oh, I can't believe it.
Neither can I.

39:03.442 --> 39:05.411
I'm gonna be able to spend
my whole day eating poké

39:05.444 --> 39:08.914
and talking about 4K TVs,
and it's all because of you.

39:08.947 --> 39:10.916
Thank you so much.

39:10.949 --> 39:12.918
You're, like, so cool.

39:12.951 --> 39:15.421
Oh, thank you, but really?

39:15.454 --> 39:17.689
I mean, did you
see me back there?

39:17.723 --> 39:19.591
I'm kind of a mess.

39:19.625 --> 39:20.992
Are you kidding me?

39:21.026 --> 39:23.829
You're, like, the smartest,
most badass girl I know.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.597
You crushed it in there!

39:25.631 --> 39:29.435
But I, like,
ruined your application.

39:29.468 --> 39:31.036
Ah, it's...
it was my fault.

39:31.069 --> 39:32.704
I handed it in
without reading it.

39:32.738 --> 39:35.441
But then, last night,
I sat down and actually read it.

39:35.474 --> 39:37.976
And the parts
I understood were great.

39:38.009 --> 39:40.145
(both laughing)

39:43.815 --> 39:46.785
I'm so glad
you moved here, Becks.

39:55.927 --> 39:57.896
PAULA:
Okay.
REBECCA:
Oh, my gosh.

39:57.929 --> 39:58.930
Here we go.
Okay.

40:01.066 --> 40:02.768
Mmm!

40:02.801 --> 40:04.870
BOTH:
Mmm! Mmm!

40:04.903 --> 40:06.605
(laughs)
Oh!

40:06.638 --> 40:09.841
Oh, my God, it's so good.

40:09.875 --> 40:11.577
I know.
It's so wrong.

40:11.610 --> 40:13.845
Mm-hmm.
But it's so right.

40:13.879 --> 40:17.015
Yeah. Hey, what happened
to your, um, healthy choices?

40:17.048 --> 40:19.451
Led to the unhealthiest decision
I ever made.

40:19.485 --> 40:20.719
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. Mm.

40:20.752 --> 40:22.688
That was dumb.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:22.721 --> 40:23.922
(laughing)
(phone plays tune)

40:23.955 --> 40:26.191
Mm. Oh, that's my mom.

40:26.224 --> 40:27.726
Mm.
Ignore.

40:27.759 --> 40:30.462
(gasps)
Now, that was

40:30.496 --> 40:31.863
a healthy choice, Cookie.

40:31.897 --> 40:34.733
Mm.
Cheers.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.535
HEATHER:
So, in conclusion,

40:36.568 --> 40:39.538
my preliminary diagnosis
of the subject

40:39.571 --> 40:42.941
is that she requires
further study.

40:42.974 --> 40:44.242
Seems to me like
she doesn't fit in

40:44.275 --> 40:45.977
to any of the categories
of your little book.

40:46.011 --> 40:47.178
MAN:
Ms. Davis, she sounds like

40:47.212 --> 40:50.015
she's suffering from a number
of classifiable disorders.

40:50.048 --> 40:52.884
Well, I'm sure she is.

40:52.918 --> 40:56.121
But you know what?
I don't want to label her.

40:56.154 --> 40:58.490
I just want to be her friend.

40:59.958 --> 41:03.695
This class blows. I quit.

41:03.729 --> 41:05.764
I knew
I should have taken coding.

41:08.099 --> 41:09.735
"Do you feel
disgusted and uneasy

41:09.768 --> 41:11.937
with your current butter?"

41:11.970 --> 41:15.273
"Make an effort, make a
decision, don't make mistakes"?

41:15.306 --> 41:18.810
Gary, you've been coming up with
some really intense copy lately.

41:18.844 --> 41:20.245
Don't get me wrong.

41:20.278 --> 41:22.514
The butter is flying
off the shelves, but...

41:22.548 --> 41:27.586
is everything okay?

41:27.619 --> 41:31.857
I left my wife
for a prostitute. (crying)
