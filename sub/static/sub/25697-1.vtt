02:33.387 --> 02:35.387
Hey, where should we
hang these lights?

02:35.389 --> 02:37.590
Elias will know for sure.

02:37.592 --> 02:39.094
Why not put them
over there?

02:40.561 --> 02:44.463
This will be just perfect for
the aurora borealis festival.

02:44.465 --> 02:46.665
Aw, it's gonna be
great fun!

02:51.974 --> 02:55.409
We probably should have sent out
more invitations on Boatbook.

02:57.145 --> 02:59.645
Do you think many more people
will come this year?

02:59.647 --> 03:03.350
Ha! Why would anyone come
to an aurora borealis festival

03:03.352 --> 03:06.051
when there's no
aurora borealis to see?

03:06.053 --> 03:07.486
Just a big storm brewin'.

03:07.488 --> 03:10.391
Well, then, we can have
a festival just for us.

03:15.263 --> 03:16.195
Bah!

03:17.131 --> 03:18.230
Huh?

03:18.232 --> 03:19.899
Look, here comes
the Queen of the Sea!

03:19.901 --> 03:22.533
Maybe even more boats
will be coming from Big Harbor.

03:22.535 --> 03:24.069
Big Harbor!

03:25.006 --> 03:27.139
What do they have
we don't have right here?

03:27.141 --> 03:29.174
Well, a festive atmosphere?

03:29.176 --> 03:30.644
- Humph!
- Whoa!

03:36.050 --> 03:38.583
Food! Food! Food!

03:38.585 --> 03:40.953
- Where to?
- To find food!

03:42.390 --> 03:44.189
Big boat means pickings!

03:47.161 --> 03:48.327
Huh?

03:52.465 --> 03:55.433
Ah, ma'am,
where are you going?

03:55.435 --> 03:56.868
Are you in a rush?

03:56.870 --> 04:00.238
I simply must get to Big
Harbor before the storm hits.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.572
Big storm?

04:01.574 --> 04:03.007
But what about the festival?

04:03.009 --> 04:04.976
You can just forget
about the festival.

04:04.978 --> 04:07.145
No boat should be out now.

04:07.147 --> 04:08.648
Whoa!

04:10.450 --> 04:12.050
<i>Gerald from Big Harbor,</i>

04:12.052 --> 04:13.920
<i>calling all rescue boats.</i>

04:14.587 --> 04:16.154
Yes, Elias here.

04:16.156 --> 04:17.689
<i>Hi, Elias.</i>

04:17.690 --> 04:22.293
<i>We have a report of a vessel
observed down at the Black Hole.</i>

04:22.295 --> 04:23.861
Oh! The Black Hole!

04:23.863 --> 04:24.998
The Black Hole?

04:25.464 --> 04:27.332
In this weather?

04:27.334 --> 04:30.401
- Oh.
- That boat is driftwood already.

04:32.973 --> 04:35.672
<i>I have motor trouble.
Can't go out.</i>

04:35.674 --> 04:37.574
<i>Any chance of you
getting out there?</i>

04:37.576 --> 04:38.775
Uh... Yes, sir.

04:38.777 --> 04:40.046
I'll head out right away.

04:40.512 --> 04:41.847
<i>Thanks, Elias.</i>

04:42.382 --> 04:43.513
<i>Be careful.</i>

04:43.515 --> 04:46.018
<i>And listen, I owe you one.</i>

04:47.187 --> 04:48.852
The Black Hole?

04:48.854 --> 04:51.588
Do you know how many ships
have vanished there,

04:51.590 --> 04:53.590
and never come out again?

04:53.592 --> 04:56.593
It's much too dangerous
for a little boat.

04:56.595 --> 04:59.531
Well, good thing
I'm not little anymore.

05:01.100 --> 05:02.299
Well, well.

05:03.702 --> 05:07.137
Oh, my schedule.
I have to continue on.

05:07.139 --> 05:08.140
Ship ahoy.

05:08.741 --> 05:11.210
No go here!

05:26.959 --> 05:28.760
Oh! Oh!

05:52.583 --> 05:54.150
That was close.

06:02.326 --> 06:03.692
Hello!

06:03.694 --> 06:07.163
I'm Elias, the rescue boat.

06:07.165 --> 06:08.764
Yeah, I can see that.

06:11.469 --> 06:14.238
And who are you gonna rescue?

06:15.139 --> 06:16.240
You?

06:17.641 --> 06:20.608
I don't need
to be rescued!

06:20.610 --> 06:24.048
I just need to get
my motor started again.

06:25.183 --> 06:27.984
- I think I'm gonna try to...
- Oi!

06:29.220 --> 06:30.985
Hey, watch it, will ya?

06:30.987 --> 06:33.222
Don't push me into that cliff!

06:38.396 --> 06:40.463
I'm doing
the best I can!

06:43.900 --> 06:47.702
Go, get some help,
you imbecile!

06:47.704 --> 06:49.437
I can't get through the radio.

06:49.439 --> 06:50.905
Of course not.

06:50.907 --> 06:53.508
There's too much electromagnetic
interference around here.

06:53.510 --> 06:55.278
Don't you know anything?

06:56.246 --> 07:00.014
Honestly, who sends
a baby rescue boat?

07:01.251 --> 07:02.383
Baby?

07:02.385 --> 07:03.820
I'm no baby.

07:27.643 --> 07:28.742
Hey!

07:28.744 --> 07:30.978
This isn't the way
to Big Harbor.

07:30.980 --> 07:32.212
No.

07:32.214 --> 07:33.916
We're going to Cosy Cove.

07:34.317 --> 07:35.583
Cosy Cove?

07:35.585 --> 07:37.485
Not that town.

07:37.487 --> 07:39.686
I know my way to Cosy Cove.

07:39.688 --> 07:40.954
It's my home,

07:40.956 --> 07:43.357
and I'm not taking any chances
in strange waters,

07:43.359 --> 07:45.092
especially in this storm.

07:54.803 --> 07:58.472
How crazy can he be, going out to the
Black Hole when a storm is coming?

07:58.474 --> 08:00.474
- He must be totally nuts.
- Shush.

08:00.476 --> 08:02.109
He doesn't scare me.

08:03.845 --> 08:06.180
Huh? Where... Where am I?

08:06.182 --> 08:07.147
In Cosy Cove.

08:07.149 --> 08:08.814
We're on our way
to get a berth for you.

08:08.816 --> 08:09.916
A berth? Ugh!

08:09.918 --> 08:11.518
No, forget about it.

08:11.520 --> 08:12.852
Do you have a shipyard?

08:12.854 --> 08:14.887
I need to, uh, repair my motor.

08:14.889 --> 08:17.089
But now? It's the
middle of the night.

08:17.091 --> 08:19.326
Yeah. Most guys will think
it's a real treat

08:19.328 --> 08:22.028
to get to repair a boat from Big Harbor like me.

08:22.030 --> 08:23.863
Oh! My fish!

08:23.865 --> 08:26.968
I hate fish.

08:28.136 --> 08:30.406
We could
try to wake up Goliath.

08:32.541 --> 08:34.607
Not like that,
you numskull!

08:35.544 --> 08:37.611
Ugh!

08:37.613 --> 08:39.779
I thought
you were gone for good.

08:39.780 --> 08:43.149
Not me. I always
come back, Dippy.

08:43.150 --> 08:46.454
No aurora
borealis tonight either.

08:47.555 --> 08:49.322
What's that over there?

08:49.324 --> 08:53.127
No. It's just the city lights
from Big Harbor.

08:56.264 --> 08:57.729
Good night, Elias.

08:57.731 --> 08:59.267
Good night, Dippy.

09:05.772 --> 09:06.905
Ah, <i>dios mio.</i>

09:06.907 --> 09:08.039
What's your name?

09:08.041 --> 09:09.275
Give me a hand, will you?

09:09.277 --> 09:12.010
I don't have
any hands.

09:12.012 --> 09:14.846
But I have mayonnaise.

09:14.848 --> 09:16.449
- Get him!
- You see these claws?

09:16.451 --> 09:17.452
Hah!

09:26.827 --> 09:29.127
Good morning, Swifty.

09:29.129 --> 09:30.262
Sleep well?

09:30.264 --> 09:33.666
I've heard of early birds,
but you are an early boat.

09:36.003 --> 09:37.836
That was some storm
last night.

09:37.838 --> 09:40.138
Sure was.
So how's Vinnie doing?

09:40.140 --> 09:42.073
He left before the sun came up.

09:42.075 --> 09:45.410
Oh! He didn't
even say thanks?

09:45.412 --> 09:47.813
No, bit of an oddball.

09:51.051 --> 09:54.185
I hope you don't make it
a habit of rescuing boats

09:54.187 --> 09:56.521
from the Black Hole
in the middle of the night.

09:56.523 --> 09:57.988
Do I have a lot of dents?

09:57.990 --> 10:00.158
No, just small stuff.

10:00.160 --> 10:03.027
I'm thinking about that fellow
you towed in last night,

10:03.029 --> 10:05.029
that fellow, Vincent?

10:05.031 --> 10:06.564
His name is Vinnie.

10:06.566 --> 10:07.898
Strange type.

10:07.900 --> 10:09.567
He wanted me
to repair the motor,

10:09.569 --> 10:13.105
but was very careful I didn't
look into his cargo hold.

10:15.742 --> 10:17.875
Maybe he was just shy.

10:17.877 --> 10:19.943
Not that he has
any reason to be.

10:19.945 --> 10:22.813
There's no part of a boat
I haven't seen before.

10:23.916 --> 10:25.983
There's our hero, all right.

10:25.985 --> 10:27.786
I was just
doing my job.

10:27.788 --> 10:29.453
Is it your job
to be an idiot?

10:29.455 --> 10:32.423
- You could have been smashed to bits out there.
- Oh! Take it easy.

10:32.425 --> 10:34.158
You gotta be more careful.

10:34.160 --> 10:37.661
Toot-toot! Make way
for the messenger boat.

10:37.663 --> 10:40.431
I have a message
for the rescue boat Elias

10:40.433 --> 10:42.900
from Her Deep-Floating Highness,
Queen of the Sea.

10:42.902 --> 10:45.102
Ahem. In light
of your heroic deeds

10:45.104 --> 10:46.970
performed with valor
during the night,

10:46.972 --> 10:49.373
Queen of the Sea,
on behalf of Big Harbor

10:49.375 --> 10:52.343
and all vessels who have been
or ever will be in danger,

10:52.345 --> 10:54.712
invites you to
the aforementioned harbor.

10:54.714 --> 10:55.813
Big Harbor, that is,

10:55.815 --> 10:58.915
to receive a surprise...

10:58.917 --> 11:02.486
End of message.
Understood?

11:02.488 --> 11:04.020
Uh, not completely.

11:04.022 --> 11:06.923
In light
of your heroic deeds,

11:06.925 --> 11:08.425
Queen of the Sea...

11:08.427 --> 11:11.227
I get that the Queen of the Sea
wants me to go to Big Harbor.

11:11.229 --> 11:13.564
But why? What happens then?

11:13.566 --> 11:15.799
That information
is classified.

11:15.801 --> 11:18.234
That's the whole idea
behind a surprise.

11:18.236 --> 11:20.236
- Understood?
- Yes.

11:20.238 --> 11:22.840
Well, if the Queen of the Sea
is inviting us,

11:22.842 --> 11:25.041
then we have to accept.

11:39.624 --> 11:41.426
Wow!

11:42.960 --> 11:45.461
Are we there yet?

11:47.465 --> 11:48.631
Whoa.

11:49.967 --> 11:51.066
Look at all that.

11:51.068 --> 11:54.236
Now that's
what I call a harbor.

11:54.238 --> 11:57.241
I've seen
worse, if you ask me.

12:05.717 --> 12:08.684
Welcome to Big Harbor.

12:08.686 --> 12:10.118
It's very nice to be here.

12:10.120 --> 12:12.554
Well, thank you.

12:12.556 --> 12:13.957
See you later.

12:18.495 --> 12:21.096
The big city.

12:21.098 --> 12:23.398
I reckon if there's
any food here.

12:23.400 --> 12:24.633
Are you kidding?

12:24.635 --> 12:25.834
Look over there!

12:25.836 --> 12:28.238
First come,
first served!

12:32.309 --> 12:33.377
Ow!

12:39.149 --> 12:42.250
Okay, listen up. It's important
that we stay together.

12:42.252 --> 12:43.318
Huh?

12:43.320 --> 12:46.488
Hi. Are you that dude
they call Elias?

12:46.490 --> 12:47.689
Yeah, sure am.

12:47.691 --> 12:48.723
We dig you.

12:48.725 --> 12:50.057
- Yeah.
- Both of us.

12:50.059 --> 12:51.793
Uh, by the way, Elias,

12:51.795 --> 12:53.260
now that you're a star, well...

12:53.262 --> 12:55.430
Remember to keep your feet
on the ground.

12:55.432 --> 12:58.934
Or your bow in the water,
got it?

12:58.936 --> 13:01.335
Bye, Elias.
Good luck!

13:05.575 --> 13:07.274
Uh, you're Elias, right?

13:07.276 --> 13:09.210
Uh, yeah.
How did you know that?

13:09.212 --> 13:11.345
Uh, hello.

13:11.347 --> 13:14.048
You're, like, so trending
right now!

13:14.050 --> 13:16.750
Well, oh, well.

13:16.752 --> 13:18.419
- Wow.
- Oh.

13:18.421 --> 13:20.855
How was it like
out there in the storm,

13:20.857 --> 13:22.158
all alone?

13:22.960 --> 13:25.059
Well, I was just doing my job.

13:25.061 --> 13:26.729
Oh! Can we take a selfie?

13:27.396 --> 13:28.329
Uh, sure.

13:28.331 --> 13:30.364
Huh?

13:30.366 --> 13:31.432
Hey!

13:32.401 --> 13:33.400
Closer. Closer.

13:34.203 --> 13:35.970
- Closer. Closer. Closer.
- Look at me!

13:37.473 --> 13:39.072
Elias, look here!

13:39.074 --> 13:41.207
This is gonna get
like 300 likes...

13:41.209 --> 13:44.512
Now, now, small boats, you
have to leave our hero alone.

13:45.381 --> 13:47.280
So nice that you could come.

13:47.282 --> 13:50.316
We have arranged
a little reception for you.

13:50.318 --> 13:51.386
Huh?

13:55.357 --> 13:58.024
- Putting his own safety at risk...
- Wow.

13:58.026 --> 14:00.593
...he went out
into the storm

14:00.595 --> 14:02.830
and rescued Vinnie.

14:02.832 --> 14:05.933
So, Elias, in honor
of your bravery

14:05.935 --> 14:09.736
and to show our deep appreciation
of this achievement,

14:09.738 --> 14:12.505
I have the pleasure on behalf of Big Harbor...

14:12.507 --> 14:15.976
...to present to you
this special fender.

14:15.978 --> 14:18.545
This fender is presented

14:18.547 --> 14:23.316
in accordance with the guidelines
of Harbor and Safety regulations.

14:23.318 --> 14:25.153
Is the fender received?

14:27.322 --> 14:29.724
Assignment completed.

14:53.581 --> 14:54.814
Hey, Elias.

14:54.816 --> 14:58.517
Great you could
take that assignment for me.

14:58.519 --> 15:00.519
My pleasure.
You're Gerald, right?

15:00.521 --> 15:03.990
Big Harbor's very own
rescue boat at your service.

15:05.659 --> 15:08.694
I've been in for repairs
a bit too often lately.

15:09.897 --> 15:11.697
It's hard work, you know,

15:11.699 --> 15:14.099
being a rescue boat
in a city like Big Harbor.

15:14.101 --> 15:15.801
Yes, for sure.

15:15.803 --> 15:19.972
Yeah, yeah, well, you come and say
hello if you're ever in town again.

15:19.974 --> 15:21.442
Sure. I'll do that.

15:22.810 --> 15:24.042
What's up?

15:33.252 --> 15:35.020
I'm asking you
what's happening.

15:35.022 --> 15:36.253
Nice fender.

15:36.255 --> 15:39.490
Thanks. I just got it
for rescuing a boat.

15:39.492 --> 15:41.258
Ooh. Respect.

15:41.260 --> 15:43.227
Do you wanna take a photo?

15:43.229 --> 15:44.295
Photo of what?

15:44.297 --> 15:46.230
Uh, me and you.

15:46.232 --> 15:48.633
Are you
full of yourself or something?

15:48.635 --> 15:51.671
Sorry. I just thought
that's what you do around here.

15:52.205 --> 15:53.638
You're cute.

15:53.640 --> 15:54.940
Cute?

15:54.942 --> 15:56.376
Okay, selfie.

15:57.044 --> 15:58.311
Ah.

16:01.314 --> 16:02.749
My name is Stella.

16:03.449 --> 16:04.982
Elias.

16:07.220 --> 16:09.153
See you later, rescue boy,

16:09.155 --> 16:10.287
if you're ever in town again.

16:10.289 --> 16:11.791
I just might be.

16:13.826 --> 16:14.859
Elias.

16:14.861 --> 16:16.060
Yes, ma'am?

16:16.062 --> 16:19.563
There's something
I'd like to talk to you about.

16:19.565 --> 16:20.600
Come with me.

16:21.634 --> 16:23.434
Well, okay.

16:23.436 --> 16:26.437
Do you like Big Harbor?

16:26.439 --> 16:27.705
Oh, yes, ma'am. Very much.

16:27.707 --> 16:31.142
Well, you know, I think
Big Harbor likes you too.

16:31.144 --> 16:32.208
Hi.

16:32.210 --> 16:33.711
Do you think so?

16:33.713 --> 16:34.511
I do.

16:34.513 --> 16:37.247
And Big Harbor
needs a hero.

16:37.249 --> 16:39.984
We already have
a rescue boat, Gerald.

16:39.986 --> 16:41.052
Yes, he's very nice.

16:41.054 --> 16:43.219
But we need a faster boat,

16:43.221 --> 16:45.522
one that
understands young people,

16:45.524 --> 16:47.791
one that everyone
can look up to,

16:47.793 --> 16:51.261
one not in need of repairs
al the time.

16:51.263 --> 16:53.229
Someone like that
is hard to find.

16:53.231 --> 16:54.497
Indeed.

16:54.499 --> 16:57.634
But now, we have found
that someone.

16:57.636 --> 16:58.401
Oh?

16:58.403 --> 17:00.003
You.

17:00.005 --> 17:00.970
Me?

17:00.972 --> 17:02.038
Yes, Elias.

17:02.040 --> 17:03.940
I wanted to give you
a big surprise,

17:03.942 --> 17:07.444
but as well as that, I
wanted to make you an offer.

17:07.445 --> 17:08.944
So...

17:08.946 --> 17:10.781
What? What is it?

17:12.284 --> 17:13.717
Young Elias,

17:13.719 --> 17:19.790
will you be the new rescue
boat in Big Harbor?

17:24.829 --> 17:26.428
Oh. Uh...

17:26.430 --> 17:28.262
What about Cosy Cove?

17:28.265 --> 17:32.234
I am going to pick up some cargo,
and then, head north tomorrow.

17:32.236 --> 17:35.105
I shall expect an answer
from you by then.

17:35.107 --> 17:36.440
Ship ahoy.

17:38.275 --> 17:40.476
Wow.
Quite an offer.

17:40.478 --> 17:43.679
I'd grab that
with both fenders, Elias.

17:43.681 --> 17:44.847
Really? Would you?

17:45.850 --> 17:48.250
Everyone was talking about you
at the party.

17:48.252 --> 17:50.586
You are a hero, Elias.

17:50.588 --> 17:53.123
You could be the biggest fish
of them all.

17:53.125 --> 17:55.091
Did someone say "fish"?

17:55.093 --> 17:58.093
You know, you got to make
the most of the chances you get.

17:58.095 --> 17:59.895
Just ask Trawler.

18:00.898 --> 18:02.733
Ask him about Brazil.

18:04.969 --> 18:05.903
Trawler?

18:06.203 --> 18:07.301
Trawler!

18:07.303 --> 18:08.604
Huh?

18:08.606 --> 18:10.706
Excuse me,
but Cruiser was saying...

18:10.708 --> 18:13.675
Get it out, boy. Has a
crab got your tongue?

18:13.677 --> 18:15.110
Uh, Brazil.

18:15.112 --> 18:16.444
What about Brazil?

18:16.446 --> 18:18.113
I don't know anything
about Brazil.

18:18.115 --> 18:21.752
Uh, it was just that Cruiser
said I should ask you about...

18:29.093 --> 18:32.127
- Cha-cha-cha, samba!
- Hello?

18:32.129 --> 18:34.829
- Oh, amazing.
- Trawler?

18:34.831 --> 18:39.034
Yeah, well, I was once asked
to go to Brazil to fish,

18:39.036 --> 18:40.768
but I never did go.

18:40.770 --> 18:44.405
I stayed in Cosy Cove
and fished for herring.

18:44.407 --> 18:46.541
That's how it was,
and that's how it is.

18:46.543 --> 18:49.944
Well, now I have to go to sleep
and rest up for tomorrow.

18:49.946 --> 18:51.979
Oh. Okay. Good night.

18:51.981 --> 18:53.950
Brazil...

18:56.486 --> 18:57.854
Huh?

18:59.055 --> 19:00.288
Stella.

19:00.290 --> 19:01.958
Hello, sailor boy.

19:03.459 --> 19:05.595
Whoo!

19:06.262 --> 19:07.695
Uh... I...

19:07.697 --> 19:10.097
I just wanna say
it was nice meeting you.

19:10.099 --> 19:12.133
- And...
- And?

19:12.135 --> 19:13.267
Nothing.

19:13.269 --> 19:14.802
What's up?

19:14.804 --> 19:17.370
So, this is my gang.

19:17.372 --> 19:18.371
This is Brenda.

19:18.373 --> 19:19.472
Uh, hi there.

19:19.474 --> 19:20.407
Hey, there, you.

19:20.409 --> 19:21.708
And this is Racer
and Speedster.

19:21.710 --> 19:23.110
- Yo.
- They're twins.

19:23.112 --> 19:24.111
Bro!

19:24.113 --> 19:25.313
And last,
but certainly not slowest,

19:25.315 --> 19:26.379
Flash.

19:29.018 --> 19:30.218
Wow.

19:30.220 --> 19:32.153
Wanna join us
for a little tour?

19:32.155 --> 19:34.387
Uh, I don't know.

19:34.389 --> 19:37.091
I should stay here
and take care of my friends.

19:37.093 --> 19:38.458
Uh, big boss.

19:38.460 --> 19:40.694
You're not one of those
goody-two-shoes, are you?

19:40.696 --> 19:42.062
Me?

19:42.064 --> 19:43.363
No, of course not.

19:43.365 --> 19:44.664
Hey, what's up?

19:44.666 --> 19:47.135
You'll be all right.
You gotta see the city.

19:48.103 --> 19:49.769
Uh, I've already
seen some parts.

19:49.771 --> 19:52.505
But not
the cool parts.

19:52.507 --> 19:53.506
Yo, let's go.

It's my fish, Gill!

21:22.896 --> 21:23.995
Whoa.

21:23.997 --> 21:26.198
- Hey, what'd you do that for?
- Hi, Elias.

21:26.200 --> 21:29.401
We've been here long enough.
Can we go home now?

21:29.403 --> 21:30.702
Uh, not yet.

21:30.704 --> 21:32.572
I have to do something first.

21:33.106 --> 21:34.739
Okay. We'll go on ahead.

21:34.741 --> 21:36.308
You follow us later, all right?

21:36.310 --> 21:38.076
Yeah,
I'll be along soon.

21:38.078 --> 21:39.012
I promise.

21:41.681 --> 21:43.915
A wise
decision, Elias.

21:43.917 --> 21:45.316
Look, Big Harbor.

21:45.318 --> 21:46.951
If you can make it here,
you can...

21:46.953 --> 21:49.320
Well, you can make it
both here and there.

21:49.322 --> 21:52.323
I have to leave soon to go
north, so we haven't much time.

21:52.325 --> 21:53.825
Bah!

21:53.827 --> 21:55.793
Now, don't take that tone,
Gerald.

21:55.795 --> 21:57.962
We already agreed
that this is for the best.

21:59.299 --> 22:00.431
<i>You</i> agreed.

22:00.433 --> 22:01.498
Where are you headed?

22:01.500 --> 22:04.202
Away
from Big Harbor.

22:04.204 --> 22:06.938
They no longer have
any use for me around here.

22:06.940 --> 22:10.141
But I thought we were
going to work together.

22:10.143 --> 22:12.243
Oh, no. Nope.

22:12.245 --> 22:14.012
You're on your own now, Elias.

22:14.014 --> 22:14.945
Huh?

22:14.947 --> 22:17.217
Now, watch out
for your motor.

22:17.783 --> 22:19.084
It can get burned out.

22:19.386 --> 22:20.951
Oh.

22:20.953 --> 22:24.257
Come now, Elias.
You have a lot to learn.

22:27.960 --> 22:29.293
Whoa!

22:29.295 --> 22:31.728
Watch where
you are going!

22:31.730 --> 22:33.663
I think you'd make
a very good rescue boat,

22:33.665 --> 22:38.137
but you will soon discover there's
a lot more to handle in this town.

22:39.204 --> 22:40.172
Hi!

22:41.340 --> 22:42.472
Meh.

22:43.976 --> 22:47.010
Rescue work
is extremely important,

22:47.012 --> 22:50.047
but preventative work
is just as important.

22:50.049 --> 22:52.449
Do you know what
"preventative" means, Elias?

22:52.451 --> 22:54.518
Uh, no.

22:54.520 --> 22:57.320
In addition to getting
boats out of trouble,

22:57.322 --> 23:01.491
you have to make sure that they don't
get into trouble in the first instance.

23:01.493 --> 23:02.426
I see.

23:02.428 --> 23:03.960
- Oi, look out!
- Whoa!

23:03.962 --> 23:06.695
- Hey, are you trying to squash me or something?
- Squash you?

23:06.697 --> 23:09.199
- I just said not to pull the chain!
- Jerk!

23:10.835 --> 23:12.802
Now, now, boys.
Calm down.

23:12.804 --> 23:14.737
Look at you, you jerk.

23:14.739 --> 23:18.442
Solve the little problems before
they become big problems.

23:18.444 --> 23:19.575
Do you understand?

23:19.577 --> 23:21.278
Yeah, ma'am.

23:21.280 --> 23:23.447
Keep your eyes open.

23:23.449 --> 23:24.580
Stay alert.

23:31.289 --> 23:32.556
That's Spanish.

23:32.558 --> 23:35.691
You have to know a little bit of
every language here in this...

23:35.693 --> 23:37.626
Whoa!

23:38.963 --> 23:41.530
Whoa! You're supposed
to navigate around the buoys?

23:41.532 --> 23:44.867
Elias, this is Bobby,
the navigation buoy.

23:44.869 --> 23:47.269
Bobby, this is our
new rescue boat.

23:47.271 --> 23:49.038
We've met before.

23:49.040 --> 23:50.172
Rescue boat?

23:54.345 --> 23:55.578
Huh?

23:55.580 --> 23:57.014
Rescue boat.

23:59.417 --> 24:01.283
You are a rescue boat. Ha.

24:01.285 --> 24:02.518
An actual fact.

24:02.520 --> 24:03.952
Okay. Sorry about that.

24:03.954 --> 24:05.154
Uh, no.

24:05.156 --> 24:07.622
Come along. We have to prepare
for your life in the city.

24:07.624 --> 24:10.392
- Okay.
- This is not gonna end well.

24:10.394 --> 24:12.026
Ugh.

24:12.028 --> 24:14.698
- Ah, that's better!
- Yuck.

24:18.702 --> 24:20.902
Don't worry.
You are in good hands.

24:20.904 --> 24:22.670
Oh! Hey!

24:41.091 --> 24:42.058
Whoa.

24:43.493 --> 24:44.760
Ta-da!

24:46.163 --> 24:48.795
Yes. Well, I have to pick up
some more cargo and then...

24:48.797 --> 24:49.930
Are you
leaving already?

24:49.932 --> 24:52.100
Vinnie's cargo
has to be delivered.

24:52.102 --> 24:55.869
Vinnie? What sort of
cargo does he carry?

24:55.871 --> 24:58.005
That was
a very direct question.

24:58.007 --> 25:00.575
In the transport business,
one doesn't ask.

25:00.577 --> 25:02.277
One follows orders.

25:02.279 --> 25:03.478
Uh, okay.

25:03.480 --> 25:05.547
Look, you need to
hurry over to the marina.

25:05.549 --> 25:07.114
There's been an incident.

25:07.116 --> 25:08.115
I'm on it.

25:08.117 --> 25:10.751
Splendid.
We're counting on you.

25:10.753 --> 25:12.154
Ship ahoy.

25:12.589 --> 25:14.356
Yeah.

25:18.327 --> 25:20.127
Hey!

25:21.430 --> 25:23.230
Careful. You gotta watch out.

25:23.232 --> 25:24.898
And stay close together.

25:24.900 --> 25:25.933
Ah!

25:27.269 --> 25:29.403
Hey! Slow down.

25:29.405 --> 25:30.504
Are you serious?

25:30.506 --> 25:33.307
There's a five-knot speed limit
inside the harbor.

25:33.309 --> 25:34.875
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

25:34.877 --> 25:37.710
Was I, uh, going
a little too fast, perhaps?

25:37.712 --> 25:40.581
Yes. Don't let that
happen again. Okay?

25:40.583 --> 25:41.714
Mmm-hmm.

25:42.951 --> 25:46.386
Whoa. Hey, you!
Look out!

25:46.388 --> 25:47.922
Whoa!

25:48.657 --> 25:51.023
Oh. Sorry, I didn't see her.

25:51.025 --> 25:53.826
Oh, boy,
that was really close.

25:53.828 --> 25:54.961
Hey, thanks.

25:54.963 --> 25:57.063
I was just listening
to some loud music.

25:57.065 --> 25:58.064
Ah!

25:58.066 --> 26:00.833
<i>♪ Sunshine
Taking over me... ♪</i>

26:05.474 --> 26:06.772
Hey, guys.

26:06.774 --> 26:08.874
Do you have to argue
all the time?

26:08.876 --> 26:11.479
If you try to cooperate,
you'll get twice as much done.

26:12.615 --> 26:14.046
- Well...
- Cooperate?

26:14.048 --> 26:15.514
You may have something here.

26:16.517 --> 26:18.818
Sounds like a good idea.

26:18.820 --> 26:21.956
Great. See you tomorrow then.
Have a good day.

26:31.199 --> 26:33.865
<i>Calling Elias.
Calling Elias!</i>

26:33.867 --> 26:35.970
Uh, yes, Elias here.

26:36.571 --> 26:37.902
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

26:37.904 --> 26:40.106
Uh, yes, ma'am.
No problem.

26:40.108 --> 26:41.741
<i>Very good.</i>

26:41.743 --> 26:43.376
<i>Now, you have to go
to the fish warehouse</i>

26:43.378 --> 26:45.711
<i>and help a boat
who is stuck in the gate.</i>

26:45.713 --> 26:47.415
Sure. I'm on my way.

26:50.485 --> 26:52.183
Uh, fish warehouse.

26:52.185 --> 26:54.553
Fish warehouse.
Fish ware...

26:54.555 --> 26:56.154
- Ow!
- Hey!

26:56.156 --> 26:57.425
Sorry!

26:59.059 --> 27:01.460
Are you the boat who called
for emergency rescue?

27:01.462 --> 27:02.495
Genius!

27:02.497 --> 27:04.262
You managed to figure
that out on your own?

27:04.264 --> 27:06.865
Why don't you just
go get Gerald?

27:06.867 --> 27:09.769
Uh, Gerald doesn't work
in Big Harbor anymore.

27:09.771 --> 27:11.271
So who is his replacement?

27:12.072 --> 27:13.204
Me.

27:13.206 --> 27:16.074
You? Are you
some kind of intern?

27:16.076 --> 27:19.210
No, I am the new rescue boat.

27:19.212 --> 27:21.613
Well, I can't
stay here all day.

27:21.615 --> 27:22.647
Help me!

27:22.649 --> 27:24.084
Okay.

27:34.094 --> 27:37.564
It's too late to get
Gerald back, I suppose?

27:45.037 --> 27:46.972
Ready? Here!

27:52.912 --> 27:54.380
And pull!

27:55.381 --> 27:56.914
Now you have to reverse.

27:56.916 --> 27:59.151
Ugh. Think I don't know that?

28:00.152 --> 28:03.420
- And a heave!
- And a ho!

28:12.665 --> 28:14.066
Yuck.

28:18.571 --> 28:21.138
Mmm! Did you order takeaway?

28:21.140 --> 28:23.040
Huh? No.

28:23.042 --> 28:24.974
But something
sure does smell good.

28:24.976 --> 28:27.111
It smells delicious,
if you ask me.

28:27.113 --> 28:28.978
Phew! Let me tell ya.
You know what?

28:28.980 --> 28:31.883
If only I had fingers,
I'd be holding my nose.

28:34.953 --> 28:36.353
Hi there.

28:36.355 --> 28:38.089
Oh, uh, hi.

28:39.958 --> 28:41.859
I thought you were gone.

28:41.861 --> 28:44.127
No. I'll be staying around.

28:44.129 --> 28:46.229
I'm the new rescue boat
here in Big Harbor.

28:46.231 --> 28:47.997
Respect.

28:49.635 --> 28:51.267
Uh...

28:51.269 --> 28:53.002
- Tough day?
- Not really.

28:53.004 --> 28:54.470
Let's go for
a little cruise then.

28:54.472 --> 28:55.938
Well, the Queen
of the Sea said

28:55.940 --> 28:57.741
I had to make sure
I got enough sleep.

28:57.743 --> 28:59.877
Boring.

28:59.879 --> 29:02.512
Yes. But I am the new
rescue boat around here.

29:02.514 --> 29:04.347
- And you know what else you are?
- No.

29:04.349 --> 29:08.684
The smelliest, stinkiest boat
in Big Harbor.

29:08.686 --> 29:09.852
Ugh.

29:09.854 --> 29:11.387
Come on, my little <i>bacalhau.</i>

29:11.389 --> 29:13.558
I know how you can
get rid of that smell.

29:20.398 --> 29:21.466
Check this out.

29:22.500 --> 29:24.702
Look at those lazy things.

29:26.136 --> 29:28.671
I've seen garden hoses
with more water.

29:29.774 --> 29:32.075
Can't even
dampen a stamp.

29:33.812 --> 29:36.146
Less energy than a boy band.

29:37.882 --> 29:39.749
Is this really very wise?

29:45.989 --> 29:47.723
They're getting pretty angry.

29:52.563 --> 29:54.996
I will get you back
for this, Stella.

30:09.546 --> 30:11.646
Thanks for the shower.

30:14.518 --> 30:16.151
And now
that you're all clean,

30:16.153 --> 30:18.620
you gotta come out to the
town with me. Right?

30:18.622 --> 30:20.020
Well, what about my work?

30:20.022 --> 30:22.657
Listen, did I already tell you
about my two other boat friends?

30:22.659 --> 30:23.625
No.

30:23.627 --> 30:25.125
Billy Bob and Little Jane.

30:25.127 --> 30:28.430
Two cool boats who came here
looking for happiness.

30:28.432 --> 30:31.131
- What happened?
- The nicest boats you could imagine.

30:31.133 --> 30:32.399
They were part of the gang.

30:32.401 --> 30:34.636
Then one day,
they were just gone.

30:34.638 --> 30:37.438
But boats don't just vanish
into thin air.

30:37.440 --> 30:40.307
My point is, no one knows
what tomorrow will bring.

30:40.309 --> 30:42.176
That's why
I want to live for today.

30:42.178 --> 30:44.715
I could be gone tomorrow.

30:47.016 --> 30:48.117
Come on!

30:49.820 --> 30:51.120
Oh.

30:53.723 --> 30:54.757
Hi.

30:55.625 --> 30:57.525
Yo, what do we have here?

30:57.527 --> 31:00.127
Looks like
a little rescue boat.

31:00.129 --> 31:03.297
Whoa, I feel safer already.

31:03.299 --> 31:05.866
Relax. He's cool.
Where's the party?

31:05.868 --> 31:08.502
The party is where we make it.

31:08.504 --> 31:09.436
All right.

31:09.438 --> 31:11.137
<i>♪ The baddest boat around</i>

Hmm.

32:09.497 --> 32:10.565
Huh?

32:17.772 --> 32:19.706
Huh?

32:19.708 --> 32:20.842
Hello?

32:25.379 --> 32:27.680
Uh...

32:27.682 --> 32:29.381
What are you up to, eh?

32:29.383 --> 32:32.551
Well, if it ain't the town's
new rescue boat.

32:32.553 --> 32:34.219
Uh...

32:34.221 --> 32:37.623
Rescue boat,
or "res-cue ball," huh?

32:37.625 --> 32:40.459
I say let's find out.

32:40.461 --> 32:41.893
Uh...

32:41.895 --> 32:43.397
Hey, what's going on here?

33:01.382 --> 33:03.015
He can't swim.

33:04.283 --> 33:05.452
Help him.

33:06.152 --> 33:07.686
Help the kid.

33:07.688 --> 33:09.087
Grabber!

33:09.089 --> 33:10.254
Now!

33:10.256 --> 33:11.623
Before it's too late.

33:11.625 --> 33:12.693
Okay.

33:20.400 --> 33:22.801
Did you have yourself
a nice bath?

33:23.804 --> 33:25.469
Don't go drowning on us now.

33:25.471 --> 33:28.773
If you wanna save yourself,
little rescue boat,

33:28.775 --> 33:32.209
stay away from this
side of the harbor!

33:37.183 --> 33:39.318
Hey. Hmm?

33:40.020 --> 33:41.552
You okay?

33:41.554 --> 33:42.887
Yeah.

33:42.889 --> 33:44.422
I ran into Vinnie
and the others.

33:44.424 --> 33:46.390
They're up to something
for sure.

33:46.392 --> 33:49.193
I told you before
to stay away from Vinnie.

33:49.195 --> 33:50.530
Promise me you will.

33:51.931 --> 33:54.331
Okay. I promise.

33:54.333 --> 33:55.902
Come on, sweet cheeks.

34:00.940 --> 34:02.506
I'm gonna sleep here.

34:02.508 --> 34:05.076
No chance of that
around here.

34:05.078 --> 34:07.712
Turn off that music!

34:10.215 --> 34:13.583
I say!
And if the music continues,

34:13.585 --> 34:16.053
then you will all be
expelled from the harbor

34:16.054 --> 34:19.989
on the authority of Queen
of the Sea and Big Harbor.

34:19.992 --> 34:22.025
Well? Understood?

34:22.027 --> 34:25.362
No more music.
The party is over!

34:30.534 --> 34:31.902
Elias?

34:32.337 --> 34:34.071
Uh, yes.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.938
What are you doing here?

34:35.940 --> 34:39.610
Me? Uh, I was just passing by.

34:41.413 --> 34:42.612
Stella...

34:42.614 --> 34:45.014
This is what I like
about the city, Gull.

34:45.016 --> 34:46.750
There's always
something going on.

34:46.752 --> 34:50.319
We cannot tolerate a rescue boat who
hangs out with the town's riffraff.

34:50.321 --> 34:51.788
Uh, no, ma'am.

34:51.790 --> 34:54.224
Have you lost your mind!

34:54.226 --> 34:55.925
What has happened
to you, Elias?

34:55.927 --> 34:59.662
I'll give you one more chance,
just one more chance

34:59.664 --> 35:02.932
to show me that I have not
made a mistake in choosing you.

35:02.934 --> 35:05.935
- Yes, ma'am.
- Now, do your job, and clean yourself up.

35:05.937 --> 35:08.705
- Oh, of course.
- I don't have time for this.

35:08.707 --> 35:10.039
I must be off.

35:10.041 --> 35:15.011
No more of this LOL or ROFL or
whatever it is you kids are doing.

35:15.013 --> 35:16.447
Ship ahoy.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.650
Uh, ma'am?

35:20.252 --> 35:22.152
Just a minute, please.

35:22.154 --> 35:26.557
You said that part of my job was to
keep my eyes open and stay alert.

35:27.458 --> 35:29.259
And?
What is your point?

35:29.261 --> 35:30.793
I'm in a hurry.
I have work to do.

35:30.795 --> 35:34.163
I think that, uh, Vinnie and his
friends are up to something.

35:34.165 --> 35:36.298
You do, do you?
What?

35:36.300 --> 35:39.434
Uh, I'm not quite sure, but...

35:39.436 --> 35:41.336
Well, then, let's go
and ask them.

35:41.338 --> 35:44.540
Hey! You guys be careful
with those crates here.

35:44.542 --> 35:46.175
What is it this time?

35:46.177 --> 35:50.012
Elias seems to think that
you boys are up to something.

35:50.014 --> 35:51.113
Hmm?

35:51.115 --> 35:53.447
- What do you mean?
- What, us?

35:53.449 --> 35:55.449
These are
honest businessmen.

35:55.451 --> 35:56.785
You don't think for a moment

35:56.787 --> 35:58.654
that I would do business
with goons?

35:58.656 --> 36:00.354
No, ma'am.

36:00.356 --> 36:02.657
- But Stella said...
- Stella?

36:02.659 --> 36:03.491
Stella?

36:03.493 --> 36:05.160
That gang of troublemakers?

36:05.162 --> 36:08.263
Good thing that
Vinnie broke away from them.

36:08.265 --> 36:09.231
Isn't that right?

36:09.233 --> 36:10.398
Mm-hmm.

36:10.400 --> 36:12.466
- Uh...
- Remember, one more chance.

36:12.468 --> 36:14.069
Now, go, get
a good night's sleep

36:14.071 --> 36:17.005
so you are refreshed and ready
for work tomorrow.

36:17.007 --> 36:18.775
- Okay, ma'am.
- Ship ahoy.

36:21.878 --> 36:24.681
Hoist to lift.
That's it. A little higher.

36:25.448 --> 36:27.550
Yep. Yeah. Higher.

36:49.538 --> 36:51.672
Elias!

36:51.674 --> 36:53.007
Hi.

36:53.009 --> 36:55.642
Uh, where are the others?

36:55.644 --> 36:58.346
Uh, decided to cool
it a bit after we got busted.

36:58.348 --> 36:59.579
Phew!

36:59.581 --> 37:01.951
I meant to say,
uh, good idea.

37:02.952 --> 37:04.085
But we could do something.

37:04.087 --> 37:05.654
You know, just you and me?

37:06.521 --> 37:07.854
Well, I don't know.

37:07.856 --> 37:10.891
- I have to get my sleep, and I'm up early...
- Hey.

37:10.893 --> 37:12.059
Don't you like me?

37:12.061 --> 37:14.262
Yes, I do.
A whole lot.

37:14.264 --> 37:16.663
- A whole lot?
- But the Queen of the Sea said that...

37:16.665 --> 37:18.133
You like me a whole lot?

37:18.700 --> 37:19.599
Yes.

37:19.601 --> 37:21.101
Like, you're okay.

37:21.103 --> 37:22.569
Uh, a lot okay.

37:23.906 --> 37:25.107
Come on, then.

37:31.980 --> 37:34.180

Over.

38:37.244 --> 38:38.744
Uh, I've been kind of busy.

38:38.746 --> 38:41.747
A fishing boat has run
aground on Block Reef.

You must go immediately.

38:43.516 --> 38:44.515
Uh, yes, of course.

38:44.517 --> 38:46.185
Over. Understood?

38:46.187 --> 38:47.518
You go on, Elias.

38:47.520 --> 38:49.021
I'll see you a little later.

38:49.023 --> 38:50.189
Now!

38:50.191 --> 38:51.926
Oh. Gotta go.

38:55.162 --> 38:56.494
No... No...

38:56.496 --> 38:58.330
Hey...

38:58.332 --> 39:00.332
No. Help! Help.

39:00.334 --> 39:01.532
What can I do?

39:01.534 --> 39:04.102
You should have been here
hours ago.

39:04.104 --> 39:08.539
That's what you... You could
and should have done!

39:10.043 --> 39:11.310
I can tow him into shore.

39:11.312 --> 39:14.512
No, you can't
because you are fired.

39:14.514 --> 39:16.280
Huh? What?

39:16.282 --> 39:18.082
Fired?

39:18.084 --> 39:21.886
I had to alter my schedule in order
to take care of things here.

39:21.888 --> 39:25.089
And I never, ever,
I say "ever",

39:25.091 --> 39:26.424
alter my schedule.

39:26.426 --> 39:27.425
Never!

39:27.427 --> 39:28.793
But, I...

39:28.795 --> 39:31.229
By the time I have docked
in Big Harbor,

39:31.231 --> 39:35.066
you will have packed up your
things and left town for good.

39:36.102 --> 39:39.404
And don't even think
about coming back.

39:39.406 --> 39:41.072
But wait!

39:41.074 --> 39:46.910
You have made yourself and
me the laughingstock of the town.

39:46.912 --> 39:48.881
Ship ahoy!

40:02.462 --> 40:03.829
Elias.

40:05.764 --> 40:10.233
You have to remember that
things go up and down in life, Elias.

40:10.235 --> 40:11.770
Elias!

40:12.571 --> 40:16.075
Up... and down.

40:17.476 --> 40:19.575
And up...

40:19.577 --> 40:21.814
And down.

40:25.384 --> 40:27.685
<i>Elias. Where are you?</i>

40:28.554 --> 40:30.856
Uh, I have to go somewhere.

40:31.557 --> 40:33.023
<i>When will you be back?</i>

40:33.025 --> 40:34.293
Uh, I don't know.

40:34.859 --> 40:36.061
<i>Elias.</i>

41:05.223 --> 41:06.689
Oh, Elias.

41:06.691 --> 41:09.725
I hear that you got
an important job in town.

41:09.727 --> 41:10.995
How is it going?

41:12.598 --> 41:13.831
Huh?

41:14.599 --> 41:15.900
Oh.

41:22.639 --> 41:24.507
Why, Elias!

41:24.509 --> 41:26.175
Are you here on a visit?

41:26.177 --> 41:30.045
Yes. I guess you could
call it a visit.

41:30.047 --> 41:33.215
Yeah. Maybe he's finally
come to say goodbye.

41:33.217 --> 41:34.782
Huh? What do you mean?

41:34.784 --> 41:37.819
You said you would follow us,
but then you never did.

41:37.821 --> 41:40.156
Yeah. Well, I'm home now.

41:40.158 --> 41:43.194
So, have you missed having
a rescue boat around here?

41:43.827 --> 41:46.430
Yeah, uh, well, uh...

41:47.298 --> 41:48.897
Hi, Elias.

41:48.899 --> 41:50.665
- Do you know Gerald?
- Yes.

41:50.667 --> 41:52.635
He was the rescue boat
in Big Harbor,

41:52.637 --> 41:54.269
but, uh...

41:54.271 --> 41:55.837
He got... He got fired.

41:55.839 --> 41:57.705
Aren't you in Big Harbor?

41:57.707 --> 41:59.575
Uh, yeah,

41:59.577 --> 42:01.676
but I'd rather
work here instead.

42:01.678 --> 42:03.778
Heh! Well, that
would be difficult

42:03.780 --> 42:06.347
as I am the rescue boat
around here now.

42:06.349 --> 42:09.384
Oh. Okay. Uh, I see.

42:09.386 --> 42:10.787
That's great news.

42:11.087 --> 42:12.688
Uh...

42:28.737 --> 42:31.239
No, Swifty,
you can't come with me.

42:31.241 --> 42:31.972
Huh?

42:31.974 --> 42:33.441
You have to stay here.

42:39.181 --> 42:41.248
Remember, Elias,

42:41.250 --> 42:43.884
one must never forget
one's friends.

42:43.886 --> 42:47.321
And you know, sometimes
it is okay to apologize.

42:47.323 --> 42:50.359
Yeah? Well, I'm looking
forward to when they do.

42:51.695 --> 42:53.260
Hmm.

43:05.207 --> 43:07.574
Elias, what are you
doing out here?

43:07.576 --> 43:09.710
Can I stay out here
for a few days?

43:09.712 --> 43:13.647
Of course. But didn't you
move to Big Harbor?

43:13.649 --> 43:16.583
Yeah, but now
I've moved back home.

43:16.585 --> 43:18.918
Well, not <i>home</i> exactly.

43:18.920 --> 43:21.921
I'm obviously
not welcome there either.

43:21.923 --> 43:24.757
In Cosy Cove?
Why not?

43:24.759 --> 43:28.330
It seems Swifty and Dippy
have found a new friend.

43:30.499 --> 43:32.198
You need anything?

43:32.200 --> 43:34.135
No. No, I'm fine.

44:45.072 --> 44:46.672
Whoa!

44:46.674 --> 44:49.174
What was that for?

44:49.176 --> 44:51.576
Just checking to see
if you were alive.

44:51.578 --> 44:54.079
You have been lying there for days.

44:54.081 --> 44:55.280
You have to do something.

44:55.282 --> 44:56.981
I don't have to
do anything.

44:56.983 --> 44:59.484
That's the good thing
about getting fired.

44:59.486 --> 45:04.955
But you've been hanging around so long,
you have algae growing on your fender.

45:04.957 --> 45:08.861
Okay, fine.
Maybe I will do something.

45:11.565 --> 45:12.930
So what are you gonna do?

45:39.625 --> 45:43.496
I wish I never came
out here to rescue Vinnie.

45:48.434 --> 45:49.969
Huh?

45:51.470 --> 45:52.972
What's he doing here?

45:53.272 --> 45:54.772
Hmm.

46:07.952 --> 46:11.590
Now, Vinnie, let's just see
what you're up to.

46:23.769 --> 46:27.573
<i>Oh, maybe this wasn't
such a good idea.</i>

46:36.014 --> 46:38.683
<i>I wouldn't like to be here
on high tide.</i>

46:44.756 --> 46:45.957
Oh.

46:46.758 --> 46:49.294
Up. All the way up.

46:59.938 --> 47:01.504
Ah.

47:01.506 --> 47:05.207
Okay. Pull 'em up.
Little chain. That's enough.

47:05.209 --> 47:07.042
Hold is pretty full.

47:07.044 --> 47:09.211
The tide is about to turn.

47:09.213 --> 47:10.648
Yeah.

47:12.182 --> 47:13.048
Hmm.

47:13.050 --> 47:14.884
Okay,
I'm outta here.

47:14.886 --> 47:16.151
What about this one?

47:16.153 --> 47:18.688
Come on.
Get that last crate onboard.

47:18.690 --> 47:19.956
Okay.

47:30.334 --> 47:32.133
- Oh, dear.
- Who's there?

47:33.537 --> 47:35.038
Uh... Uh...

47:57.728 --> 47:59.228
Phew.

48:00.296 --> 48:02.931
<i>Are you sure?
The Black Hole?</i>

48:02.933 --> 48:04.900
No one goes in there willingly.

48:06.202 --> 48:09.036
And they say it's only
possible during low tide.

48:09.038 --> 48:11.873
What happens if you're
in there at high tide?

48:11.875 --> 48:13.675
Then you will be
skewered on the rocks

48:13.677 --> 48:16.410
which hang from the ceiling like dragons' teeth.

48:16.412 --> 48:18.947
They are called stalactites.

48:18.949 --> 48:21.348
But why would anyone
wanna go in there?

48:21.350 --> 48:24.019
There are rumors that there
is a precious metal in there.

48:24.021 --> 48:25.619
Norwegium.

48:25.621 --> 48:27.087
Valuable and rare.

48:27.089 --> 48:28.455
And stronger than steel.

48:28.457 --> 48:30.891
Oh! Oh! Can I get some
for my wheels?

48:30.893 --> 48:31.993
No.

48:31.995 --> 48:34.595
It's against the law
to mine Norwegium.

48:34.597 --> 48:35.829
Oh.

48:35.831 --> 48:38.499
The metal is so powerful that
if you remove it from the rock,

48:38.501 --> 48:41.869
it creates
electromagnetic radiation.

48:41.871 --> 48:42.970
I get it.

48:42.972 --> 48:45.472
That's what stopped
my radio working.

48:45.474 --> 48:46.640
Not only that,

48:46.642 --> 48:49.043
the Norwegium can
influence the weather

48:49.045 --> 48:51.110
and destroy
the atmospheric balance

48:51.112 --> 48:54.582
in such a way
the aurora borealis vanishes.

48:54.584 --> 48:56.984
Do you think Vinnie
is mining Norwegium?

48:56.986 --> 48:58.919
Oh, no, no, no.

48:58.921 --> 49:00.353
I don't think so.

49:00.355 --> 49:04.123
No, he's much too big
to work in there.

49:04.125 --> 49:06.326
Hmm. Strange though.

49:06.328 --> 49:08.328
I have to get
to the bottom of this.

49:08.330 --> 49:09.663
To the bottom?

49:09.665 --> 49:11.364
That doesn't
sound so good.

49:11.366 --> 49:13.099
But you can't do it
on your own.

49:13.101 --> 49:15.201
Well, it looks
like I have to.

49:15.203 --> 49:17.339
There's no one else
who can help me.

49:18.106 --> 49:20.241
Be careful, Elias.

49:22.444 --> 49:23.543
Hmm.

49:23.545 --> 49:26.412
Why can't he just apologize
to his friends.

49:26.414 --> 49:30.685
Yeah. Now, if it were
only that simple.

49:31.152 --> 49:32.554
But it is.

49:33.288 --> 49:36.558
Perhaps, Trolley. Perhaps.

49:43.898 --> 49:45.567
Coast is clear.

50:06.587 --> 50:09.356
Okay. I'll send
a new delivery tomorrow.

50:10.457 --> 50:12.726
Come on.
Fill it all the way up.

50:13.794 --> 50:15.061
Move it, will ya?

50:15.063 --> 50:17.396
Yep. Job's almost finished.

50:17.398 --> 50:19.898
Just a few more crates to go.

50:20.934 --> 50:22.336
Okay, that's it.

50:22.970 --> 50:24.169
I tell ya,

50:24.171 --> 50:26.738
that Queen of the Sea
is so full of herself,

50:26.740 --> 50:28.206
she won't suspect a thing.

50:28.208 --> 50:29.641
Yeah, that's right, boss.

50:29.643 --> 50:32.010
That ol' busybody,
she ain't got a clue.

50:34.381 --> 50:35.147
Hmm.

50:37.151 --> 50:38.686
- What was that?
- Huh?

50:41.354 --> 50:43.088
Is there anything?

50:43.090 --> 50:44.390
Hello?

50:49.596 --> 50:50.564
Hello?

50:59.073 --> 51:00.371
Eh!

51:04.610 --> 51:07.580
Sweet dreams.
Sleep tight, old man.

51:22.628 --> 51:23.661
Huh?

51:43.649 --> 51:45.082
Stella?

51:45.084 --> 51:47.151
Oh, it's just you.

51:47.153 --> 51:48.384
Just me?

51:48.386 --> 51:50.353
You really are something.

51:50.355 --> 51:52.857
I didn't think you're the
kind to just run off.

51:52.859 --> 51:54.390
Oh, well...

51:54.392 --> 51:56.160
I lost my job.

51:56.162 --> 51:58.663
So what? That's no reason
to run away.

51:59.297 --> 52:00.864
No. I'm sorry.

52:00.866 --> 52:03.000
I didn't think
you'd want to see me again

52:03.002 --> 52:05.635
because I'm such a jerk.

52:05.637 --> 52:07.771
You could have
at least said goodbye.

52:07.773 --> 52:08.772
I missed you.

52:08.774 --> 52:11.341
I don't like it when
friends disappear, Elias.

52:11.343 --> 52:13.409
I told you about Little Jane
and Billy Bob.

52:13.411 --> 52:15.311
Yes, you did.

52:15.313 --> 52:16.848
And I know where they are.

52:31.263 --> 52:32.529
In there?

52:32.531 --> 52:34.363
We're going in there?

52:34.365 --> 52:36.532
It's okay
as long as it's ebb tide.

52:36.534 --> 52:38.467
You know, that's when
the tide is at its lowest.

52:38.469 --> 52:40.637
I know what ebb tides are,
ka-boom.

52:40.639 --> 52:43.338
Of course.
Sorry.

52:43.340 --> 52:46.876
So, uh, did you
really miss me?

52:46.878 --> 52:49.547
Uh, depends what you
mean by "miss."

52:51.682 --> 52:52.916
Huh?

52:52.918 --> 52:54.052
It's time.

52:54.819 --> 52:56.420
Okay, let's do it.

53:03.861 --> 53:05.295
Are you scared?

53:05.297 --> 53:06.728
Mmm-mmm.

53:06.730 --> 53:10.233
Good, because there's nothing
in here to be scared of.

53:13.904 --> 53:15.137
Ow!

53:15.139 --> 53:16.538
That was just a bat.

53:16.540 --> 53:18.073
Nothing to worry about.

53:18.075 --> 53:19.577
Oh, I could see that.

53:27.417 --> 53:29.053
This is where they were.

53:29.687 --> 53:31.286
Billy Bob?

53:31.288 --> 53:34.024
Little Jane?
Are you in there?

53:35.391 --> 53:38.193
Hello? No one's here.

53:38.195 --> 53:39.460
Boy...

53:39.462 --> 53:41.096
...we sure are lucky
to have a boss like Vinnie.

53:41.098 --> 53:43.098
I mean,
he treats us real nice.

53:43.100 --> 53:44.565
We sure are.

53:44.567 --> 53:47.002
- He lets us work here all day and all night...
- Hello?

53:47.004 --> 53:50.239
...to save up for a vacation
to the whole wide world.

53:50.241 --> 53:53.674
Uh, hey, Little
Jane, how about we take five?

53:53.676 --> 53:54.909
Sure, we can do that.

53:54.911 --> 53:56.744
- Billy Bob? Little Jane?
- Huh?

53:56.746 --> 54:00.282
Oh, Stella!
What are you doing here?

54:00.284 --> 54:02.251
No, what are <i>you</i> doing here?

54:02.253 --> 54:04.452
Working for Vinnie,
of course.

54:04.454 --> 54:06.954
Yes, but you are also
drilling for Norwegium.

54:06.956 --> 54:08.155
And that's illegal.

54:08.157 --> 54:09.457
- Is it?
- What?

54:09.459 --> 54:11.425
No, there must be
some mistake.

54:11.427 --> 54:14.028
But...
But you're in chains.

54:14.030 --> 54:17.064
Oh, no. They're for
our own safety.

54:17.066 --> 54:19.600
And Vinnie pays our salary
into our account, and...

54:19.602 --> 54:22.005
And we're getting
a vacation bonus too.

54:24.974 --> 54:27.775
- We've been duped.
- There's probably no retirement fund either.

54:27.777 --> 54:31.078
Yeah, you should go
and ask Vinnie about that.

54:31.080 --> 54:32.547
We can't.

54:34.150 --> 54:36.483
We're chained down here.

54:36.485 --> 54:38.352
I'll go and get help.
I promise.

54:38.354 --> 54:40.422
We'll be right back, okay?

54:44.394 --> 54:45.625
What'll we do?

54:45.627 --> 54:47.763
Now, she has to believe us.

55:08.350 --> 55:10.817
Oh. I should have known
it was you.

55:10.819 --> 55:14.321
Go away. I'm having
my afternoon snooze.

55:14.323 --> 55:15.689
I'm sorry that
I woke you up, ma'am,

55:15.691 --> 55:17.090
but we need your help.

55:17.092 --> 55:18.725
There are two boats that
have been taken prisoners...

55:18.727 --> 55:20.626
Haven't I told you already?

55:20.628 --> 55:23.063
You are not welcome back.

55:23.065 --> 55:24.030
Please, listen.

55:24.032 --> 55:26.765
Vinnie and his gang
are smuggling Norwegium.

55:26.767 --> 55:28.567
And you are helping them.

55:28.569 --> 55:30.337
How very dare you?

55:30.339 --> 55:31.837
Have you no shame?

55:31.839 --> 55:34.540
Do you think this nonsense will
help you get your job back?

55:34.542 --> 55:35.908
- Just go away!
- Yes, I mean, no, but...

55:35.910 --> 55:38.044
And take that little
rubble rouser with you.

55:38.046 --> 55:39.079
- Huh?
- Hey!

55:39.081 --> 55:42.581
And if I hear you repeat
these absurd accusations,

55:42.583 --> 55:44.250
either here or in Cosy Cove,

55:44.252 --> 55:46.485
I will make certain that you
are reduced to splinters.

55:47.588 --> 55:50.089
- Huh?
- Ship ahoy.

55:55.930 --> 55:57.730
Now what do we do.

55:57.732 --> 56:00.067
We have
one last option.

56:11.078 --> 56:13.178
So, suddenly
we're good enough for you.

56:13.180 --> 56:16.148
Can we forget about that argument
now and rescue Stella's friends?

56:16.150 --> 56:18.250
- You can apologize later.
- What?

56:18.252 --> 56:19.852
We apologize?

56:19.854 --> 56:20.618
Huh?

56:20.620 --> 56:21.819
Will you
help us or not?

56:21.821 --> 56:23.755
Please, we have to know now.

56:23.757 --> 56:25.357
No one else
can help?

56:25.359 --> 56:28.227
You, Swifty, and Helinor are
the only ones I can trust.

56:28.229 --> 56:30.029
The others might tell
the Queen of the Sea,

56:30.031 --> 56:32.565
and I will be
reduced to splinters.

56:33.467 --> 56:35.066
See if I care.

56:35.068 --> 56:36.103
Huh?

56:38.239 --> 56:40.305
Okay, then. We're in.

56:40.307 --> 56:42.241
But we need more help.

56:42.243 --> 56:43.409
Well, you know what?

56:43.411 --> 56:45.710
Elias isn't the only one who
has friends he can count on.

56:45.712 --> 56:48.146
Brenda, proceed with Plan B.

56:54.921 --> 56:58.124
- Yo, old wreck!
- Rusty old wreck!

56:58.358 --> 56:59.592
Huh?

57:00.427 --> 57:01.893
Yeah, whatever.

57:01.895 --> 57:04.262
- Hey, dude.
- Move it, you tubs!

57:04.264 --> 57:05.496
Out for a cruise?

57:06.466 --> 57:09.133
Out of my way!
Hey! Move!

57:10.136 --> 57:12.537
You hear me? Hey!

57:12.539 --> 57:14.771
Will you turn off
that stupid music?

57:14.773 --> 57:16.507
Sorry, I can't hear you.

57:16.509 --> 57:18.978
Music is way too loud, dude.

57:40.866 --> 57:42.868
- We're going in.
- Mmm-hmm.

57:46.672 --> 57:49.507
Hey!
You came back.

57:49.509 --> 57:51.074
And we brought Dippy along.

57:51.076 --> 57:53.477
She can drill
through your chains.

57:53.479 --> 57:54.947
Catch you later.

58:10.229 --> 58:11.796
Soon, you'll be free.

58:15.067 --> 58:16.366
All right!

58:17.369 --> 58:19.102
Hey! Aw, man!

58:19.104 --> 58:20.636
Get off my brother!

58:20.638 --> 58:22.771
Oh, I'm so sorry.

58:22.773 --> 58:25.810
I didn't see you down there.

58:27.879 --> 58:30.547
- That was not cool.
- Not at all cool, brother.

58:30.549 --> 58:32.683
Not cool?
Sure it is!

58:33.485 --> 58:35.585
Out of my way!

58:40.592 --> 58:42.458
Come on, Dippy.
Come on.

58:42.460 --> 58:43.659
You can do it!

58:51.335 --> 58:52.667
This is gonna take time.

58:52.669 --> 58:54.470
There's Norwegium in the rock,

58:54.472 --> 58:56.572
almost impossible to drill.

58:56.574 --> 58:58.740
Vinnie could show up
any minute now.

58:58.742 --> 59:01.277
Don't worry. We already
thought about that.

59:03.915 --> 59:04.915
Huh?

59:08.519 --> 59:09.819
No...

59:10.388 --> 59:12.221
No, please!

59:14.458 --> 59:16.425
I hate fish!

59:16.427 --> 59:19.595
I hate fish!

59:22.567 --> 59:24.366
Fish! Food!

59:24.368 --> 59:25.334
Feast!

59:25.336 --> 59:27.503
No more junk food for us!

59:27.505 --> 59:29.170
I love life!

59:29.172 --> 59:32.106
Oh, no,
not the gulls! Please!

59:32.108 --> 59:33.176
Please!

59:43.853 --> 59:46.554
- What?
- A signal from Vinnie.

59:46.556 --> 59:48.158
He must be in trouble.

59:54.698 --> 59:57.766
I really hate fish.

01:00:02.606 --> 01:00:05.573
Ugh! What happened
to you, boss?

01:00:05.575 --> 01:00:07.575
These dudes
are totally crazy.

01:00:07.577 --> 01:00:10.311
We're not the ones who've been
mining Norwegium illegally

01:00:10.313 --> 01:00:12.879
and chaining two helpless
boats up in a cave.

01:00:12.881 --> 01:00:15.617
But Elias and Dippy are there
right now, freeing them.

01:00:15.619 --> 01:00:17.851
Just wait until the Queen of
the Sea hears about this.

01:00:17.853 --> 01:00:19.886
- What's with you, boss?
- Yeah.

01:00:19.888 --> 01:00:21.389
How could you let yourself
get beat

01:00:21.391 --> 01:00:24.324
by a couple of tiny tubs
and a bunch of feathers?

01:00:24.326 --> 01:00:26.226
We have to stop 'em!

01:00:26.228 --> 01:00:28.061
Everyone will know
what you're up to.

01:00:28.063 --> 01:00:30.230
Dippy will have drilled the
chains apart in no time.

01:00:30.232 --> 01:00:33.433
What? You're drilling
inside the Black Hole?

01:00:33.435 --> 01:00:35.168
Yeah. So what?

01:00:35.170 --> 01:00:37.337
The entire cave
will cave in.

01:00:37.339 --> 01:00:40.440
Vinnie,
you have to do something.

01:00:50.686 --> 01:00:52.719
I hope the cave
can withstand all this.

01:00:54.690 --> 01:00:56.089
What was that?

01:01:02.498 --> 01:01:04.199
Huh? Oh, no.

01:01:06.167 --> 01:01:08.468
Shut your mouth,
Black Hole!

01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:11.605
And swallow our secret
while you're at it.

01:01:13.207 --> 01:01:15.475
Hey!
What are you doing?

01:01:17.045 --> 01:01:19.579
Hey! Not on me.

01:01:19.581 --> 01:01:21.316
You'll wreck my paint job.

01:01:22.651 --> 01:01:24.718
Vinnie, you have to
make them stop!

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:26.252
Check this out.

01:01:26.254 --> 01:01:27.253
Stop!

01:01:27.255 --> 01:01:29.355
- Eh?
- This has gone far enough.

01:01:29.357 --> 01:01:33.426
I don't want a bunch of little
boats on my conscience.

01:01:33.428 --> 01:01:34.960
What's up with you, boss?

01:01:34.962 --> 01:01:36.629
We're having a ball here.

01:01:36.631 --> 01:01:37.897
You're wrecking our fun.

01:01:37.899 --> 01:01:39.632
What's your problem?

01:01:39.634 --> 01:01:41.567
Trigger, Grabber!

01:01:41.569 --> 01:01:44.238
You two, go back
to Big Harbor.

01:01:44.706 --> 01:01:46.105
Now!

01:01:46.107 --> 01:01:48.741
Why don't you chill out,
old timer?

01:01:50.311 --> 01:01:51.876
Watch this.

01:01:51.878 --> 01:01:54.215
Helinor,
use the net!

01:02:01.556 --> 01:02:02.956
Help.

01:02:05.727 --> 01:02:08.261
Shh. It's gone quiet outside.

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.373
The cave is collapsing.

01:02:21.375 --> 01:02:23.942
Swifty, take Stella
and get out of here.

01:02:23.944 --> 01:02:25.143
Not without you and the others.

01:02:25.145 --> 01:02:28.012
They're almost free.
Go! Now!

01:02:30.016 --> 01:02:31.885
We'll be right behind you.

01:02:34.187 --> 01:02:36.390
Come on, come on.

01:02:37.824 --> 01:02:41.061
Swifty, Stella,
where are the others?

01:02:44.997 --> 01:02:46.899
Don't give up. Come on!

01:03:05.184 --> 01:03:07.786
Come on, everybody,
we can do this.

01:03:23.736 --> 01:03:25.436
Oh, we're free!

01:03:25.438 --> 01:03:28.338
- We are, we're free.
- Free at last!

01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:29.475
Good job, guys.

01:03:32.778 --> 01:03:34.246
Unbelievable.

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:36.715
I can't...

01:03:39.452 --> 01:03:41.885
We better get out of here,
and fast!

01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:48.661
Whoa!

01:03:51.296 --> 01:03:53.296
What's goin' on here?

01:03:53.298 --> 01:03:55.699
Elias and the others
are inside.

01:03:55.701 --> 01:03:57.603
They're going to
be buried alive!

01:04:13.485 --> 01:04:15.785
- There you are.
- Thank goodness.

01:04:15.787 --> 01:04:17.322
But where is Elias?

01:04:29.868 --> 01:04:31.801
Huh? No!

01:04:31.803 --> 01:04:33.238
Elias!

01:04:36.908 --> 01:04:38.276
Elias!

01:04:43.414 --> 01:04:44.516
Hello?

01:04:46.016 --> 01:04:47.685
Hello?

01:04:48.553 --> 01:04:49.919
Elias!

01:04:49.921 --> 01:04:51.421
Can you hear me?

01:04:52.356 --> 01:04:54.358
Yes. Hello?

01:04:55.125 --> 01:04:57.492
Someone has to help him!

01:04:57.494 --> 01:04:59.227
Wait! He rescued me.

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:01.331
Now it's my turn
to rescue him.

01:05:06.036 --> 01:05:07.437
Huh?

01:05:14.211 --> 01:05:17.078
Elias! Are you in there?

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.446
Yes!

01:05:18.448 --> 01:05:21.449
Come on, Elias,
before it's too late.

01:05:21.451 --> 01:05:23.652
But the opening is too small.

01:05:23.654 --> 01:05:24.886
I won't make it.

01:05:24.888 --> 01:05:26.755
Lay over on your side.

01:05:26.757 --> 01:05:28.423
Slide along my hull.

01:05:28.425 --> 01:05:30.859
Come on, do the trick
you've been practicing.

01:05:31.995 --> 01:05:34.029
But I've never
been able to get it right.

01:05:34.031 --> 01:05:36.400
Well, now might be
a good time to try.

01:06:24.013 --> 01:06:25.312
Unbelievable!

01:06:25.314 --> 01:06:26.212
Wow!

01:06:26.214 --> 01:06:27.615
- Whoo!
- All right!

01:06:27.617 --> 01:06:29.717
Elias, you did it.

01:06:29.719 --> 01:06:31.719
Ka-boom!

01:06:33.889 --> 01:06:35.323
Wow.

01:06:35.891 --> 01:06:37.558
Well done, Elias.

01:06:39.962 --> 01:06:41.595
Let's get out of here!

01:06:41.597 --> 01:06:43.264
Go! Go!

01:06:46.201 --> 01:06:48.134
Whoa!

01:06:48.136 --> 01:06:49.502
Go! Go!

01:06:49.504 --> 01:06:50.838
Come on!

01:07:07.055 --> 01:07:09.457
- Oh.
- Wow.

01:07:29.110 --> 01:07:30.576
Look!

01:07:30.578 --> 01:07:33.980
The aurora borealis,
it's come back.

01:07:37.284 --> 01:07:38.953
It's so beautiful!

01:07:41.422 --> 01:07:43.524
It's so good
to see them again.

01:07:54.868 --> 01:07:56.635
It's so beautiful!

01:07:56.637 --> 01:07:58.870
Are you going to
eat that herring?

01:07:59.973 --> 01:08:03.442
I would like
to apologize to a little boat

01:08:03.444 --> 01:08:06.778
who is not so little anymore.

01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:09.147
Not once, but twice.

01:08:09.149 --> 01:08:13.118
Firstly, because I didn't
believe you, Elias.

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:18.288
Secondly, I want to apologize for
taking you away from Cosy Cove,

01:08:18.291 --> 01:08:21.225
because here
is where you belong.

01:08:21.227 --> 01:08:23.327
- Yeah!
- Well done!

01:08:23.328 --> 01:08:25.328
So, starting tomorrow,

01:08:25.331 --> 01:08:30.801
you are once again Cosy Cove's official rescue boat.

01:08:30.804 --> 01:08:32.170
And, Gerald,

01:08:32.171 --> 01:08:34.305
you are needed
back in Big Harbor.

01:08:34.307 --> 01:08:37.975
You have a whole armada
of rescue boats to train.

01:08:37.978 --> 01:08:39.111
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:08:39.113 --> 01:08:41.578
And when you all
come to visit Cosy Cove,

01:08:41.581 --> 01:08:44.950
a whole newly renovated harbor
will greet you.

01:08:44.952 --> 01:08:46.550
Isn't that right, Vinnie?

01:08:46.551 --> 01:08:48.853
At your service, ma'am.

01:08:51.591 --> 01:08:55.627
Finally, I have a serious
question to ask all of you.

01:08:56.095 --> 01:08:57.296
Huh?

01:09:00.433 --> 01:09:02.635
Where's the party?

01:09:13.246 --> 01:09:17.881
Say what you like, but they sure
know how to party. Crazy, huh?
