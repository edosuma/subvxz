00:57.599 --> 00:59.893
Help! Help me!
No!

00:59.977 --> 01:02.062
Whoa!

01:14.157 --> 01:17.744
Behold!
My furry fists of fury.

01:26.378 --> 01:27.504
Halt!

01:29.590 --> 01:30.591
Whoa!

01:30.674 --> 01:33.051
We don't want to fight you.

01:34.136 --> 01:36.638
If you do not want to fight Puss in Boots,

01:36.722 --> 01:38.640
why are you a thief in San Lorenzo?

01:40.642 --> 01:41.643
Ha!

01:42.644 --> 01:44.563
- We are not thieves!
- Hey!

01:44.646 --> 01:45.814
- Mm-mm.
- Thief!

01:50.527 --> 01:52.696
- Stop it.
- You stop it.

01:52.779 --> 01:55.157
We are just defending ourselves.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.199
We are not thieves.

01:56.783 --> 01:57.618
Nonsense!

02:00.329 --> 02:01.747
I know thieves when I see them.

02:01.830 --> 02:03.582
- And you are...
- Students!

02:06.752 --> 02:10.213
- Students?
- Students. At my school!

02:10.297 --> 02:11.590
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

02:12.758 --> 02:13.634
What school?

02:14.217 --> 02:17.537
Miss Dulcinea's School
for Wayward Thieves.

02:18.680 --> 02:19.931
But what... wh...

02:20.515 --> 02:22.768
why associate with thieves?

02:22.851 --> 02:26.313
It worked out so wonderfully before
that I decided to re-open it.

02:26.772 --> 02:27.606
Hello.

02:28.440 --> 02:30.484
Good afternoon.

02:31.276 --> 02:33.497
Wonderfully?
Your students unleashed

02:33.532 --> 02:36.239
a righteous war,
destroying everything in sight.

02:38.659 --> 02:39.910
You can't prove that.

02:40.535 --> 02:43.997
Besides, it's part of an exchange program.
Thieves come here,

02:44.081 --> 02:46.375
and the Senior Puss Squad
goes to the Thieves' Market

02:46.458 --> 02:48.710
to study the fine points of thief culture.

02:50.879 --> 02:53.131
Now repeat after me.

03:07.604 --> 03:10.774
Very good. In no time,
you will be a bunch of...

03:10.857 --> 03:14.152
Scheming, filthy degenerates.
That is all thieves are.

03:15.404 --> 03:16.822
That wasn't very nice.

03:17.406 --> 03:18.824
Thieves are not very nice.

03:18.907 --> 03:21.284
They are incapable of change
and I will not let you waste...

Ah! Herr Boots!

03:31.878 --> 03:33.213
What are you doing here?

03:33.296 --> 03:34.840
He's my star pupil.

03:35.424 --> 03:36.967
But he is not a thief.

03:37.050 --> 03:40.387
No, but he has committed himself
to being good.

03:40.470 --> 03:41.388
Mm-hmm.

03:41.471 --> 03:44.433
To prove it, he even wrote an essay
on the Crown of Souls.

03:44.516 --> 03:46.893
"Everything I know
about the Crown of Souls,

03:46.977 --> 03:50.230
which is almost nothing.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.023
It's very short.

03:53.984 --> 03:55.861
Won't you join our choir, Puss?

All right, class.

04:15.922 --> 04:18.300
Who can complete the
following rhyme from the book?

04:18.800 --> 04:20.761
"When a friend is feeling blue..."

04:20.844 --> 04:22.095
Give them a haircut!

04:22.179 --> 04:23.638
Threaten a shopkeeper.

04:23.722 --> 04:25.140
Oh, I know, Miss Dulcinea.

04:25.599 --> 04:26.850
Go ahead, Uli.

04:33.148 --> 04:37.986
"When a friend is feeling blue,

04:45.786 --> 04:47.454
Why do you have this?

04:47.537 --> 04:49.080
Uli, you've been studying.

04:49.164 --> 04:50.791
Ja, Miss Dulcinea.

04:50.874 --> 04:54.127
I am making the studyings every evening
for six hours,

04:54.211 --> 04:56.755
followed by light calisthenics
und dancing.

04:56.838 --> 04:58.799
Well, I'm very impressed.

04:58.882 --> 05:01.802
To think, just a few weeks ago,
you were trying to burn the town down,

05:01.885 --> 05:04.095
and now, you could be teaching
your own class.

05:04.179 --> 05:05.931
Okay, everyone, let's move on.

05:37.420 --> 05:40.674

05:41.132 --> 05:43.844
Uh, is "shmoud" a word?

You are getting boot stompings
all over our flashcards!

06:13.623 --> 06:14.457
Huh?

06:21.089 --> 06:21.965
Ah.

06:22.215 --> 06:26.094
You are studying because you are students.

06:31.266 --> 06:32.100
Yes, sorry.

06:32.684 --> 06:34.269
Old habits are hard to break.

06:34.352 --> 06:36.021
Sorry. Sorry, everyone.

06:43.570 --> 06:44.404
Sorry.

06:49.743 --> 06:50.577
Hmm.

06:53.747 --> 06:58.293
I'd ask that you not decapitate
my customers till after they've paid.

06:58.376 --> 06:59.669
I cannot stand it!

07:00.045 --> 07:02.172
All of these thieves,
and I cannot fight them.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.506
They're not thieves, Puss.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.175
They're Dulcinea's students.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.593
I know, I know.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.762
And I swear, I will not attack another...

07:09.179 --> 07:10.805
Ha!

07:11.348 --> 07:12.223
Puss!

07:12.807 --> 07:14.434
I... have a problem.

07:14.517 --> 07:15.852
That ye do, laddie.

07:17.354 --> 07:18.521
That ye do.

07:26.655 --> 07:28.114
Must not attack. Must not attack.

07:29.324 --> 07:32.994
Must... not... attack.

07:41.544 --> 07:45.840
"When a fellow passes by,
tip your hat and tell him hi."

07:48.426 --> 07:49.260
Hi.

07:51.596 --> 07:55.517
Yes! Hello,
person who has a right to exist.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.152
I...

08:07.487 --> 08:08.780
- Huh?
- Everyone see that?

08:11.825 --> 08:13.743
He threatened me with a dagger.

08:14.077 --> 08:15.662
I did not.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.625
Let me tell you
one of my favorite rhymes, Puss.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.587
Get out!

08:31.219 --> 08:32.470
That did not rhyme!

08:32.554 --> 08:35.306
Unless there was more I did not hear
because I am outside now!

08:37.267 --> 08:38.434
Which is possible!

08:41.855 --> 08:43.648
Good morning, cla... Huh?

08:44.774 --> 08:46.401
Hello, Dulcinea.

08:46.818 --> 08:49.279
I am teaching your class now.
Isn't that wonderful?

08:49.779 --> 08:50.822
What the what?

08:51.406 --> 08:53.867
I was so inspired by your words yesterday,

08:53.950 --> 08:56.411
when you said,
"Uli, you should teach class,"

08:56.494 --> 08:58.788
that I decided to do precisely
as you said.

08:58.872 --> 08:59.748
Excuse me.

08:59.831 --> 09:02.459
- Um, I don't think I said that.
- Is this the part?

09:02.542 --> 09:06.880
Ja. Und in saying this,
you changed mein little goaty life.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.967
I completely understand do-gooding now.

09:11.051 --> 09:14.179
As long as you rhyme,
whatever you do is good.

09:14.262 --> 09:16.473
That's not entirely how it works...

09:17.098 --> 09:19.642
He is the greatest teacher
we have ever had

09:19.726 --> 09:21.561
and we will do whatever he says.

09:21.644 --> 09:25.732
Well, that's nice, but... I think
we should get back to the lesson plan.

09:25.815 --> 09:26.733
No way!

09:26.816 --> 09:30.153
We want Uli! We want Uli!

09:30.236 --> 09:33.198
We want Uli! We want Uli!

09:33.281 --> 09:36.910
We want Uli! We want Uli!

09:36.993 --> 09:39.621
Maybe Uli could be my assistant!

09:40.371 --> 09:43.124
We have a different idea.

09:43.958 --> 09:44.918
Whoa!

09:48.004 --> 09:50.215
And keep your stupid book!

09:56.471 --> 09:57.305
Huh?

10:02.894 --> 10:03.895
Dulcinea?

10:04.521 --> 10:05.897
This isn't what it looks like.

10:05.980 --> 10:09.317
It looks like you are smelling the door
with your ear.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.693
Which would mean...

10:12.070 --> 10:13.947
Can you hear with your nose?

10:14.447 --> 10:16.199
I wish I could hear with my nose.

10:16.282 --> 10:19.327
Maybe then my students
wouldn't have chosen Uli over me.

10:21.121 --> 10:24.082
Dulcinea, are you... jealous?

10:24.624 --> 10:26.668
No. I'm not jealous...

10:26.751 --> 10:29.712
Tut-tut-tut-tut!
Do not feel bad. I, too, am jealous.

10:30.213 --> 10:33.675
Jealous of those who are allowed
to engage in combat with filthy thieves!

10:34.175 --> 10:35.009
Hyah!

10:36.970 --> 10:38.346
Puss.

10:39.347 --> 10:41.599
Sorry. Sorry. My mistake.

10:43.560 --> 10:48.398
"When anger simmers in your heart,
find some fruit and bake a tart."

10:48.481 --> 10:51.651
I do not want to bake a tart.
I want to fight thieves.

10:51.734 --> 10:54.821
I am so good at it. I miss it. I miss it.

10:57.615 --> 11:00.785
And I miss teaching my class.
It was my whole life.

11:03.663 --> 11:07.167
I cannot fight the thieves,
but I cannot not fight the thieves.

11:07.458 --> 11:11.421
I am going to lock myself in my room
forever until I learn to control myself.

11:13.131 --> 11:16.092
And I'll start a new school
out of petty spite.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.976
My Ulites. People will try to tell you,

11:25.059 --> 11:27.896
"Surely, we do not need to do good
all of the time.

11:27.979 --> 11:30.857
Perhaps we can just do good
some of the time?"

11:30.940 --> 11:31.941
Yes!

11:34.360 --> 11:37.822
Nein! Do you want to be good? Do you?

11:37.906 --> 11:39.532
Yes, we do!

11:39.616 --> 11:42.035
- Uli, Uli, please.
- Teach me the goodness.

11:42.118 --> 11:45.830
- We want to be good, please!
- I want to walk on sunshine.

11:45.914 --> 11:49.167
I sense you have an ailment, friend.

11:49.751 --> 11:53.504
My stomach is always making
such gas.

11:53.588 --> 11:54.714
It is horrible.

11:55.298 --> 11:58.927
"When your belly hurts you so,
distract the mind

11:59.010 --> 12:00.762
und stub a toe."

12:02.513 --> 12:03.765
Why did you do that?

12:04.891 --> 12:06.476
How does your stomach feel?

12:06.976 --> 12:08.186
Hmm... Um...

12:08.645 --> 12:11.022
Why... I am cured!

12:11.105 --> 12:13.274
Behold the power of rhyme.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.026
- Wowy!
- Unbelievable!

12:15.526 --> 12:17.236
- It's a miracle.
- Now, my Ulites.

12:17.320 --> 12:22.200
Go forth und spread goodness,
no matter what the cost.

12:22.283 --> 12:27.413
Soon the evil shall repent.
Now, let us do good without consent.

12:27.497 --> 12:28.706
Huzzah!

12:38.383 --> 12:41.469
So, you will role play
the part of a thief,

12:41.552 --> 12:43.221
and I will try not to attack you.

12:46.641 --> 12:49.811
Now, I simply imagine
that you are a thief.

12:52.689 --> 12:55.024
It was so sudden and violent!

12:57.235 --> 13:00.697
Sweet Felina!
My problem is worse than I thought.

13:01.447 --> 13:02.573
This calls for...

13:05.034 --> 13:06.411
extreme measures.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.427
What you think yer doin'?

13:23.011 --> 13:27.015
"Drinking pee is gross and weird
like a turtle with a beard."

13:27.598 --> 13:30.268
That wasn't pee. It was milk.

13:30.351 --> 13:31.853
Eh, same difference.

13:32.562 --> 13:35.773
Don't listen to 'em, laddie.
You look very handsome.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.908
Where is your skin?

13:45.992 --> 13:48.828
"Ew, ew, ew!
Cover your bones whatever you do."

13:54.751 --> 13:59.088
"Never, ever spread your germs.
Do you accept our righteous terms?"

13:59.297 --> 14:00.131
Mmm-mm.

14:04.302 --> 14:06.804
"Do not wear a shirt of red
unless you want to lose your head!"

14:16.773 --> 14:18.483
Hey. What'd you do that for?

14:18.983 --> 14:22.403
"Making others feel so sad
is always, always, always bad."

14:24.030 --> 14:26.282
Did you know that doesn't make sense?

14:26.366 --> 14:30.453
"Shut your mouth, you demon spawn,
and make yourself be gone, gone, gone."

14:30.536 --> 14:32.747
Hey. None of those rhymes
are from my book.

14:33.414 --> 14:36.751

16:14.891 --> 16:16.934
- Yah!
- Huzzah!

16:29.405 --> 16:30.781
That's my face!

16:30.865 --> 16:32.950
Hey, I found a candle.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.251
Yes!

16:43.336 --> 16:46.005
Hey, what's happening? What's happening?

16:46.589 --> 16:48.299
Oh, oh, I'm old.

16:50.092 --> 16:51.093
Hey, get off.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.195
Welcome to class.

17:11.239 --> 17:12.490
I don't think anyone's coming.

17:13.491 --> 17:16.493
Well, that's okay. You count as someone.

17:17.161 --> 17:17.994
Are...

17:18.871 --> 17:22.250
- Are you sure? Because...
- Okay, let's start really basic.

17:24.085 --> 17:29.257
Good morning, class.
The key to doing is never doing bad.

17:34.136 --> 17:35.137
Eames?

17:35.221 --> 17:38.391
Oh! I'm hungry and bored.

17:38.474 --> 17:41.143
Wait. Wait, wait. Just tell me
that I'm a better teacher than Uli.

17:43.145 --> 17:45.565
I need to hear you say it!

17:50.361 --> 17:53.072
Oh, my!

17:59.495 --> 18:01.581
Uli? Are you hiding?

18:02.623 --> 18:05.835
Am I...? What? Me? Hiding?

18:05.918 --> 18:08.045
That is most humorous.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.885
Oh, it is true.

18:14.969 --> 18:18.889
Though I tried to do good,
I have made everything terrible.

18:18.973 --> 18:20.600
I am a failure.

18:24.687 --> 18:29.066
"When your troubles seem so bleak,
play a game of hide and seek."

18:31.485 --> 18:33.237
- Well, that didn't help.
- No, no.

18:42.705 --> 18:46.334
Look, I should've given you more guidance
instead of just acting jealous.

18:46.417 --> 18:50.087
You tried your best,
and that's what counts.

18:51.881 --> 18:52.840
It does?

18:53.424 --> 18:54.258
Yes.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.553
Now, before your students
destroy everything in sight...

19:00.222 --> 19:02.933
Ja. I shall fix mein goaty error.

19:07.063 --> 19:12.318
"Tiny snail with eyes of green,
how much hopscotch have you seen?"

19:13.069 --> 19:15.738
Wow! Some of these rhymes
really don't make sense.

19:21.285 --> 19:22.870
Nice try, subconscious.

19:22.953 --> 19:26.457
Creating the sounds of a fake riot
just to get me to fight thieves.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.125
Pathetic.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.254
"These evildoers
have met their match.

19:32.838 --> 19:36.300
Now, raze the town,
we'll start from scratch."

19:37.760 --> 19:38.678
Ulites.

19:40.304 --> 19:42.348
Hear me now.

19:46.852 --> 19:51.524
I, Ulschalk SÃ¼ndenbock, hereby renounce
all of my teachings

19:51.607 --> 19:56.821
und turn the school back over
to its rightful leader, Dulcinea!

19:58.406 --> 20:00.574
I look forward to teaching you all
tomorrow morning.

20:00.658 --> 20:02.243
Okay? All over now. Good talk.

20:03.244 --> 20:05.246
Tomorrow morning? What?

20:05.329 --> 20:07.248
- What is she talking about?
- I don't know.

20:07.832 --> 20:08.708
No!

20:10.251 --> 20:14.505
If Uli is no longer our leader,
we are no longer his followers.

20:14.588 --> 20:18.008
We are once again... filthy thieves!

20:21.011 --> 20:23.681
Prepare to die.

20:34.942 --> 20:37.027
Don't you want to be a student of good?

20:37.111 --> 20:41.073
Oh, no. We are filthy,
scheming degenerates.

20:49.290 --> 20:50.124
Ooh-hoo-hoo.

20:50.207 --> 20:52.126
That felt really very good.

20:52.209 --> 20:55.546
Get him!

20:55.629 --> 20:57.548
En garde!

21:03.596 --> 21:04.680
I have missed this.

21:10.478 --> 21:11.771
Shoot him!

21:16.692 --> 21:17.735
Whoo-hoo!

21:17.818 --> 21:19.945
Uh.

21:29.330 --> 21:32.458
I have not had this much fun ever!

21:49.809 --> 21:52.603
Wow! I really needed that.

21:57.233 --> 21:59.693
That laddie really does have a problem.

22:03.197 --> 22:04.365
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

22:08.244 --> 22:11.831
I guess I was wrong.
People can't really change.

22:13.415 --> 22:17.920
No, Dulcinea. You were right.
After all, Uli changed.

22:23.008 --> 22:28.013
And so did we.
We're scheming, filthy thieves. Huzzah!

22:33.227 --> 22:34.911
My thieves!

22:35.305 --> 22:41.226
