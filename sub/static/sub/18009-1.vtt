Are you kidding me?
Again?

01:53.841 --> 01:56.279
She should be
buying it wholesale.

01:56.319 --> 01:59.120
- Okay. Yeah.
- Keno, be careful.

02:01.960 --> 02:04.040
Hey, ladies.

Stay down!

03:25.204 --> 03:28.323

03:28.363 --> 03:31.882

03:31.963 --> 03:34.124

What are you doing?

04:21.243 --> 04:24.684
Sorry, kid.

Let me out of here!

04:32.444 --> 04:33.404
Yeah!

04:35.206 --> 04:37.366

04:38.325 --> 04:41.364
Rawhide! Robocop!
Come on!

04:46.446 --> 04:48.485
Ninja cowboy!

04:53.485 --> 04:56.085
Oh, you dudes

04:59.726 --> 05:02.285
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Check this!

05:03.366 --> 05:06.684
"Walk the Dog."
That's pretty good, huh?

05:06.765 --> 05:09.686
And then,
"Around the World!"

05:09.765 --> 05:12.446
Hey, hey, now you see 'em,
now you don't!

05:14.205 --> 05:15.406

Yeah!

05:48.488 --> 05:49.886
Missed me!

05:56.207 --> 05:57.648
The missing link!

06:01.327 --> 06:04.407
You want a pickle?
i'll give you a pickle!

06:11.687 --> 06:14.728
Combat cold cuts!

06:25.768 --> 06:27.649
Let's get out of here!

06:30.728 --> 06:33.448
And next time
i'll use mustard!

06:36.928 --> 06:39.968
Hey. Hey, dude.

06:40.008 --> 06:42.968
Give me your hand.
Come on.

06:44.769 --> 06:48.049
Who, what, where, huh?

06:48.129 --> 06:51.288
Well, that leaves out
"why" and "when," doesn't it?

06:52.328 --> 06:56.169
Yeah! It's a good thing we saw you
coming in here from the roof...

06:56.249 --> 06:58.408
- Hey, Mikey!
- I mean from across the...

07:01.289 --> 07:04.209
Look, kid, you can find a phone
and call the police. Are you okay?

07:04.289 --> 07:06.449
- We'll start tying them up.
- Yeah, but...

07:06.529 --> 07:09.809
Yeah, yeah, but good. Go!

07:12.009 --> 07:13.888
- Kids.
- Kids.

07:13.929 --> 07:15.970
Come on.

07:17.290 --> 07:20.729
Okay, just hurry up.
There's a ton of these guys.

07:20.810 --> 07:22.689
Okay, bye.

07:48.410 --> 07:51.171
- Well, i hope we can find a cab.
- There are lots of cabs.

07:51.211 --> 07:53.410
- Not at this time of night.
- Hey!

07:53.450 --> 07:55.811
i know you. You're, uh...

07:55.850 --> 07:58.050
- April O'Neil.
- April O'Neil, yeah.

07:58.091 --> 07:59.571
The news lady.

07:59.650 --> 08:02.331
So, how are things in
the action-news biz?

08:02.410 --> 08:04.250
Pretty tiring, mostly.

08:04.330 --> 08:06.291
Well, honey, if you cut back
on the heavy aerobics...

08:06.372 --> 08:08.491
- And all that jumping and yelling...
- It's all right, Muriel.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.571
- I find it disturbing.
- Let me get that for you.

08:10.651 --> 08:14.731
Oh, right!
My... My aerobics.

08:14.810 --> 08:18.331
- I'll do that. Bye.
- Good night, April.

08:18.412 --> 08:20.252
- Was that necessary?
- I saw her on TV.

08:20.331 --> 08:23.053
- A skirt walks by and...
- Will you stop it already?

08:44.653 --> 08:46.652
Michaelangelo.

08:53.012 --> 08:54.933
Leonardo.

08:56.373 --> 08:58.772
Donatello...

08:58.853 --> 09:01.173
and Raphael.

09:02.252 --> 09:04.972
The rat is the cleanest one.

09:10.812 --> 09:12.413
Oh, yeah!

09:14.893 --> 09:16.812
Primo workout, dudes!

09:16.853 --> 09:19.254
- Yeah!
- We showed those guys, huh?

09:19.333 --> 09:22.254
- Muy primo, bros.
- Turtle-riffic!

09:22.333 --> 09:25.332
Max-amundo.

09:25.413 --> 09:26.813
A cappella!

09:28.213 --> 09:31.654
Perestroika?

09:31.734 --> 09:35.213
Okay, i got it. "Frerejacques."
FrereJacques

09:35.293 --> 09:38.574
- FrereJacques
- Donny, give it up.

09:40.454 --> 09:42.614
- Hi, guys.
- Yo, April!

09:42.694 --> 09:44.254
What it is? Yeah!

09:44.334 --> 09:47.133
- We brought-a dinner.
- Let's eat over here.

09:47.214 --> 09:49.694
- Pizza. Again.
- Yup. Pepperoni.

09:49.775 --> 09:52.493
Please, please.
A moment to reflect.

09:57.294 --> 09:58.895
Here comes the slice.

09:58.976 --> 10:01.174
- Enjoy.
- Ninja pizza!

10:01.254 --> 10:02.613
Ninja pizza?

10:02.694 --> 10:06.094
Pizza that vanish
quickly without trace.

10:06.174 --> 10:09.134
- Here you go.
- Yo, Mikey, toss me a ninja slice!

10:09.213 --> 10:11.175
Donny, Statue of Liberty!

10:11.214 --> 10:14.174
- Come on, throw it! Over here!
- Mike, no!

10:14.255 --> 10:17.335
i'm right here! He's at the forty!
He's at the twenty!

10:17.416 --> 10:21.174
He looks. He rolls back.
He goes deep.

10:21.255 --> 10:23.055
- Yeah!
- Donatello, stop!

10:24.015 --> 10:26.016
Touchdown!
Yeah!

10:26.094 --> 10:29.015
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

10:29.094 --> 10:32.335
So, any luck finding
a new place to live yet?

10:32.414 --> 10:35.495
Well, you know, in this market
it's actually very difficult...

10:35.536 --> 10:37.935
to find good
subterranean housing.

10:37.974 --> 10:40.815
Hey, we could always go back
to the old sewer den.

10:40.896 --> 10:44.495
- Well...
- Right, Raph. It's a little tough...

10:44.575 --> 10:47.176
when about 500 members
of the Foot Clan...

10:47.215 --> 10:49.735
- Know where you live.
- He's right.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.856
We kicked their butts.
They're all in jail.

10:51.935 --> 10:54.097
'Sides, we took out
the Shredder...

10:54.137 --> 10:55.935
so what's everybody
so worried about?

10:56.016 --> 10:57.376
He's right.

10:57.455 --> 10:59.816
No. Splinter took out
the Shredder.

10:59.895 --> 11:02.296
- They're both right.
- Yeah, yeah.

11:02.376 --> 11:04.656
i was there, Leo.
Remember?

11:04.695 --> 11:08.616
Old Shred did a swan dive
with a half gainer...

11:08.656 --> 11:10.737
right into the back
of a garbage truck!

11:13.615 --> 11:15.135
Come away from there!

11:15.217 --> 11:17.497
Geez, i was just...

11:17.575 --> 11:19.416
Never forget
who you are.

11:19.497 --> 11:24.697
You are ninja. You must always
practice the art of invisibility.

11:24.776 --> 11:28.017
- All of you.
- Well, i don't get it.

11:28.058 --> 11:34.177
i mean, why? We saved the city.
Why can't we just go out and...

11:34.256 --> 11:37.018
Stand before me, my sons.

11:43.497 --> 11:48.138
For 15 years,
you have been confined below.

11:48.178 --> 11:53.897
Now the outside world
beckons your teenage minds...

11:53.938 --> 11:56.778
but they could
never understand.

11:56.818 --> 12:00.298
Their world
can never be ours.

12:02.618 --> 12:04.858
Not even pizza?

12:08.337 --> 12:09.497
Pizza's okay.

12:10.738 --> 12:12.858
Man, you give a guy
a heart attack.

12:14.218 --> 12:16.258
Here, let me get
you guys some napkins.

12:16.338 --> 12:18.098
- What for?
- What for?

12:21.739 --> 12:25.660
Take heart, child.
We will not be here much longer.

12:25.739 --> 12:29.098
Oh, no, no. You guys can
stay here as long as you want.

12:29.138 --> 12:31.298
- Oh, gee. Thanks a lot.
- No!

12:31.378 --> 12:35.060
- We do not belong here above.
- Oh, man!

12:35.099 --> 12:36.977
Yes, Master Splinter.

12:40.219 --> 12:43.901
Hey! Ten flips now!

12:43.980 --> 12:45.619
Go!

12:45.659 --> 12:47.859
Kids.

12:49.738 --> 12:52.339
- One.
- One.

12:52.420 --> 12:54.378
Such energy is wasted.

12:54.460 --> 12:56.579
- Two.
- Remember...

12:56.659 --> 13:00.940
the true ninja is
a master of all things...

13:01.020 --> 13:03.498
a master of his environment...

13:03.539 --> 13:06.299
a master of himself.

13:06.379 --> 13:10.061
Focus your thoughts
on where we must go...

13:10.100 --> 13:13.739
and leave the Shredder buried.

13:19.260 --> 13:21.180
Let's go!

14:05.021 --> 14:06.942
Come on.

14:12.022 --> 14:13.862
is this it?

14:13.942 --> 14:16.102
Everyone else must've
been picked up.

14:17.021 --> 14:18.902
Well, maybe they
didn't find us.

14:18.942 --> 14:22.782
Hey, we all knew the junkyard
was our fallback spot.

14:25.821 --> 14:29.143
Our father gone!

14:30.142 --> 14:32.061
They will pay!

14:34.581 --> 14:38.022
i, Tatsu, now lead.

14:38.102 --> 14:41.423
Let any who challenge
step forward.

14:43.544 --> 14:45.261
i challenge.

14:49.903 --> 14:51.343
His face!

14:52.343 --> 14:55.903
Master Shredder!

14:59.463 --> 15:02.582
Choose the best man
from those that remain...

15:02.621 --> 15:04.743
to follow the reporter.

15:04.823 --> 15:09.744
She is the key to finding
the creatures that did this to me.

15:09.823 --> 15:11.104
Yes, Master.

15:11.182 --> 15:13.743
Next, Master,
we rebuild the Foot?

15:15.863 --> 15:19.545
There is only
one thing next.

15:19.584 --> 15:21.943
Revenge.

15:22.023 --> 15:24.345
And in this day and age
of ecological abuse...

15:24.383 --> 15:27.424
it's nice to find a company
that's doing something to help.

15:27.505 --> 15:30.063
joining me on the final day
of their cleanup efforts...

15:30.144 --> 15:33.425
is Techno Global Research
industries spokesman...

15:33.464 --> 15:35.864
Professorjordan Perry.

15:35.905 --> 15:37.985
Excuse me. Professor?

15:39.343 --> 15:42.544
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Miss O'Neil.

15:42.585 --> 15:44.824
Professor,
perhaps you can tell us...

15:44.904 --> 15:48.064
why TGRi has finally decided
to clean up the waste...

15:48.144 --> 15:49.984
that's been burying here for years.

15:50.064 --> 15:51.905
Would you like me
to keep my answer succinct...

15:51.984 --> 15:54.423
or will you be able to edit later on
in case i start to ramble...

15:54.504 --> 15:58.585
- Which i'm in the habit of doing.
- Professor, we're live.

16:00.145 --> 16:01.665
Oh, right, well, yes.

16:01.744 --> 16:04.425
Our organization has always
been very concerned...

16:04.505 --> 16:06.744
with the welfare
of the community we serve.

16:06.824 --> 16:09.985
- Indeed, TGRI is...
- Man, who is this spasmatic?

16:10.865 --> 16:13.744
Would you give the guy a break?
He's a scientist.

16:13.785 --> 16:16.945
Yeah, fascinating.
Hey, isn't Oprah on?

16:16.985 --> 16:21.745
Raph, just leave it.
We're watching April.

16:28.706 --> 16:32.626
And dispose of them
in an ecologically more suitable way.

16:32.706 --> 16:35.745
Hey, Mikey, do you think
you can crunch any louder?

16:35.825 --> 16:38.025
i can still hear
out of this one.

16:46.066 --> 16:48.826
Come on,
let's change this.

16:48.866 --> 16:52.385
Hey, maybe somebody's got something
on our fight last night.

16:53.347 --> 16:55.226
Do not change channel.

16:55.306 --> 16:57.106
Reporting live from
Bayonne, NewJersey...

16:57.146 --> 16:59.666
this is April O'Neil,
Channel Three News.

16:59.707 --> 17:01.706
- Back to you.
- And that's it. We're off.

17:01.785 --> 17:04.464
Great.
Thank you.

17:04.506 --> 17:08.107
Professor, would you mind if i asked you
a few follow-up questions?

17:08.188 --> 17:10.226
Not at all. Oh, drat!

17:10.306 --> 17:12.185
You know, we're gonna
have to do it another time.

17:12.226 --> 17:14.426
it's been a great pleasure
meeting you, Miss O'Neil.

17:14.507 --> 17:17.426
All press members
must now clear the area.

17:17.507 --> 17:22.746
Okay, great.
Report back at 3:00, okay?

17:22.827 --> 17:25.467
- Enjoying your first day, Freddy?
- Yeah.

17:25.547 --> 17:27.387
Hey, what were you
going to ask him?

17:27.467 --> 17:30.347
Well, i don't know.

17:30.426 --> 17:33.267
Don't worry about it.
i'm paid to be suspicious.

17:34.948 --> 17:37.269
- Come on, come on.
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

17:39.708 --> 17:43.988
All non-TGRI employees
must now vacate the area.

17:45.308 --> 17:47.187
Right here.

17:49.788 --> 17:52.269
How could you
have missed this?

17:52.348 --> 17:54.188
i don't know.

17:54.269 --> 17:56.748
Grab some men.
i'll go find the professor.

17:56.828 --> 17:59.188
We've got to
take care of this now.

17:59.268 --> 18:01.148
- Go.
- Right.

18:03.389 --> 18:07.028
All members of the press must
return their visitor badges...

18:07.067 --> 18:09.028
at the main gate.

18:23.429 --> 18:25.309
Dandelions?

18:35.949 --> 18:38.029
Now, if the soil is
contaminated so far away...

18:38.110 --> 18:40.110
there must be more leaky
canisters than we thought.

18:40.189 --> 18:42.110
But how could that be?
They were only buried 15 years ago.

18:42.188 --> 18:46.509
Fifteen, fifty. Just make sure
the rest are found and removed.

18:46.590 --> 18:48.750
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea
to invite the press.

18:48.830 --> 18:51.950
Sometimes the best way to hide
is right out in public.

18:52.031 --> 18:54.991
if any of it fell
into the wrong hands...

18:55.069 --> 18:57.150
i'm well aware of the risks.

18:57.230 --> 19:00.150
Containment team, sector three.

19:03.830 --> 19:07.192
This is not the reason
i sent you to follow her.

19:07.231 --> 19:10.830
- No, Master, but i thought...
- Silence!

19:12.790 --> 19:14.871
This may be even better.

19:14.910 --> 19:19.670
Whatever caused this mutation
may be useful against my enemies.

19:20.951 --> 19:23.871
Tatsu, gather your best men.

19:23.951 --> 19:26.392
You have a mission tonight.

19:49.792 --> 19:51.952
Hey, guys!
Check this!

19:52.032 --> 19:54.512
Wax on. Wax off.

19:54.593 --> 19:57.593
- Wax on...
- Mouth off!

19:57.632 --> 20:00.191
- Hey, everyone's a critic.
- Hello?

20:00.271 --> 20:02.432
Oh, man!

20:02.513 --> 20:05.992
- April, you spoiled our surprise.
- We were gonna clean everything up.

20:06.071 --> 20:09.231
Thanks, guys.
Where's Splinter?

20:09.953 --> 20:12.913
He's been up on the roof
ever since he saw your report.

20:13.911 --> 20:16.111
Really? Doing what?

20:16.192 --> 20:19.512
Coming to a decision.

20:20.673 --> 20:23.553
You've been meditating many hours,
Master Splinter.

20:23.632 --> 20:27.752
Yes, and it is time.
join me above.

20:28.953 --> 20:31.353
Maybe you better hear
what he has to say.

20:31.434 --> 20:35.431
These last hours
have been spent...

20:35.512 --> 20:38.954
pondering many questions.

20:39.033 --> 20:44.313
Some are the very questions
of our origin.

20:44.393 --> 20:45.753
The sewer.

20:45.793 --> 20:48.393
Our transformation.

20:48.473 --> 20:51.553
But the answers have
always remained...

20:51.633 --> 20:54.273
hidden in the past...

20:54.354 --> 20:58.714
veiled by a shadow
too deep to penetrate...

21:00.193 --> 21:01.473
until now.

21:04.354 --> 21:06.633
A light from the present...

21:06.714 --> 21:11.234
reaches back
to illuminate that shadow.

21:11.313 --> 21:15.395
You have never seen this,
but know what it is.

21:16.074 --> 21:20.834
- That's the canister that had the ooze!
- That transformed us all.

21:20.874 --> 21:24.675
i have kept it these 15 years.

21:24.715 --> 21:28.194
But why do you only show us
now, Master Splinter?

21:31.594 --> 21:33.595
TGRi!

21:33.675 --> 21:36.554
The interview today.
i knew it!

21:36.633 --> 21:39.514
i knew that there was something else
going on with those guys.

21:39.595 --> 21:42.955
Yes, and we must know what...

21:43.035 --> 21:46.874
for if the contents of this
canister were not unique...

21:46.914 --> 21:51.476
the city may now face
grave danger.

21:51.554 --> 21:54.235
After all these years.

21:54.275 --> 21:57.155
After all this time
wondering who we are.

21:57.195 --> 22:01.516
The past returns, my son.

22:03.356 --> 22:08.555
it is time to seek our answers.

22:41.076 --> 22:42.997
Disposed.

22:47.997 --> 22:50.876
Well, you're the last one,
aren't you?

22:56.757 --> 22:59.358
- Come on guys.
- I love this spy stuff.

22:59.396 --> 23:01.276
Yeah.

23:05.439 --> 23:07.278
Not much to this place.

23:09.157 --> 23:11.037
it doesn't look like
there's any night security...

23:11.117 --> 23:13.118
but we better
move in quiet.

23:13.198 --> 23:15.397
- Yeah.
- Come on, Leo.

23:15.478 --> 23:19.398
What do you say?
Let's do it, eh?

23:19.478 --> 23:22.198
- Let's do it!
- Let's do it!

23:23.559 --> 23:25.917
- Times Square city!
- I don't believe it!

23:25.997 --> 23:29.438
- Like video games in 3-D!
- Totally massive!

23:30.678 --> 23:33.359
Would you get a load
of this crazy joint!

23:33.438 --> 23:37.197
The past returns. I knew
we'd find something special.

23:37.277 --> 23:39.718
i'll say special.
Look at this.

23:39.799 --> 23:43.959
- Hey, where do you put the quarter?
- Will you stop messing around?

23:44.038 --> 23:46.239
Hey, guys, over there!

23:53.558 --> 23:56.238
- What do you make of it, Donny?
- Well, i'm not sure.

23:56.318 --> 23:58.158
Looks like just a bunch
of serial numbers.

23:58.239 --> 23:59.958
Let's see, uh...

24:00.038 --> 24:02.878
Disposed.
Disposed.

24:03.839 --> 24:07.200
- Disposed.
- Hey, dudes, we're too late.

24:07.278 --> 24:09.759
Like, uh, no deposit,
no return.

24:09.800 --> 24:12.319
Well, except maybe this one.

24:12.398 --> 24:14.399
What do you mean?

24:14.439 --> 24:15.600
Look!

24:16.878 --> 24:17.799
"Active."

24:17.839 --> 24:19.919
- Yeah.
- Can you bring up the file?

24:19.999 --> 24:22.679
Well, i could try.

24:22.758 --> 24:26.239
But if the database is coded,
the whole system might go down.

24:28.121 --> 24:30.519
- Do it!
- Yeah, yeah!

24:42.279 --> 24:43.680
- Drag.
- Drat.

24:43.760 --> 24:46.840
No, no, no! So close!

24:50.280 --> 24:53.279
- What?
- The Foot!

24:55.722 --> 24:57.401
He's got the canister!

24:57.480 --> 24:59.761
- Get it!
- I got him!

25:17.361 --> 25:18.322
Go, go, go, go!

25:37.921 --> 25:40.562
- Throw it over here.
- Go long! Go long!

25:40.642 --> 25:43.083
Down field!
Turtle in the open!

25:47.282 --> 25:49.882
Ah, one, two, three, punt!

25:55.881 --> 25:58.603
Hey, guys, huddle.
Come here. Come on.

25:58.642 --> 26:01.482
Mikey, you go up the middle.
You guys take the sides.

26:01.523 --> 26:04.683
- Got it.
- I don't get it.

26:04.761 --> 26:05.883
Ready, break!

26:28.163 --> 26:30.843
Hey, Mikey, surf's up, dude!

26:33.763 --> 26:35.564
Wipe out!

26:38.803 --> 26:40.803
Ninja vanish!

26:48.204 --> 26:50.124
Oh, great!

26:51.883 --> 26:54.123
Terrific!

26:56.085 --> 26:58.004
Wonderful!

27:02.005 --> 27:03.925
Bummer!

27:06.604 --> 27:10.524
And this was the only one?

27:10.604 --> 27:12.804
Then it's time to
find out exactly...

27:12.845 --> 27:16.804
what this ooze can do.

27:16.885 --> 27:19.764
isn't it, Professor?

27:21.884 --> 27:24.845
We'll find a home soon, Paulina,
and then it'll be just you and me.

27:24.924 --> 27:28.165
Now, look, we've all talked about it.
We've decided to do it...

27:28.204 --> 27:31.005
- And that's all there is to it.
- But i don't understand.

27:31.086 --> 27:33.524
You guys haven't even found
a new place to live yet.

27:33.604 --> 27:37.725
it's too dangerous to stay here with you
when the Foot are out there. They might be
looking for us.

27:39.725 --> 27:42.405
We could go looking for them
for a change.

27:42.445 --> 27:44.405
i mean, they've got the ooze.

27:44.485 --> 27:48.006
- First we move, then we look.
- I don't know about you guys...

27:48.087 --> 27:51.685
- But i could really go for a slice of...
- Pizza!

27:51.725 --> 27:53.125
Whoa! Spookular!

27:53.165 --> 27:55.366
Miss O'Neil?

27:58.246 --> 28:02.086
Wait! I'll be right there.

28:07.125 --> 28:10.846
- What?
- I didn't order any pizza.

28:10.926 --> 28:14.046
Oh, i know.
But the guy in 313 did...

28:14.126 --> 28:16.486
and now he doesn't
seem to be there.

28:17.606 --> 28:19.927
i figured since you
order so much anyway...

28:20.006 --> 28:22.446
that, you know, maybe you...

28:24.286 --> 28:27.086
- Where'd these come from?
- Those...

28:27.167 --> 28:28.766
are mine!

28:28.846 --> 28:30.806
Yeah. I...

28:30.886 --> 28:34.726
i like to do a little chucking
every now and then.

28:39.767 --> 28:42.807
Yeah.
i'd keep practicing.

28:42.888 --> 28:46.168
On second thought,
why don't i take this pizza anyway?

28:46.248 --> 28:49.008
i can always use more.
Let me get my wallet.

28:49.047 --> 28:50.447
No, that's okay.

28:50.488 --> 28:52.367
- Yes, please.
- Don't worry about it.

28:52.407 --> 28:54.887
One last thing, though.
You might want to know about this!

28:56.367 --> 28:58.767
- You guys!
- What's the big idea?

28:58.807 --> 29:02.248
Can i hurt him? Please!
Tell me i can hurt him!

29:02.327 --> 29:04.369
- Please, please!
- Take it easy.

29:08.008 --> 29:11.608
i think you'd better sit down.

29:19.087 --> 29:22.689
And with an old
Renaissance art book...

29:22.769 --> 29:25.489
i found in a storm drain...

29:25.568 --> 29:27.889
i gave them all names.

29:27.968 --> 29:29.968
Yeah.

29:30.049 --> 29:33.488
i'm Leonardo.

29:33.569 --> 29:35.569
i'm Michaelangelo.

29:37.049 --> 29:38.929
Donatello.

29:38.968 --> 29:40.849
i'm Rafael.

29:40.889 --> 29:43.528
Yeah, all the good ones
end in "O."

29:45.569 --> 29:47.649
- Michaelangelo!
- Yeah?

29:47.728 --> 29:50.689
- Go!
- All right.

29:50.767 --> 29:53.969
i can't believe
every time i...

29:56.050 --> 29:57.370
One.

29:59.570 --> 30:01.888
- Two.
- Basically, what you're telling me...

30:01.969 --> 30:04.889
is you guys were all slimed!

30:05.729 --> 30:10.088
it wasn't slime. It was ooze.
And there's more of it out there.

30:10.169 --> 30:12.409
- Where?
- We're not sure.

30:12.489 --> 30:15.130
See, there's this sort of
clan of ninja thieves.

30:15.209 --> 30:17.411
- A secret group. They call themselves...
- The Foot?

30:17.491 --> 30:19.930
- You've heard of'em?
- The word is out...

30:20.008 --> 30:22.930
that these guys are looking
for anybody they can find...

30:23.010 --> 30:25.931
with martial arts talent,
especially teenagers.

30:26.890 --> 30:32.490
Hey, and if i let myself get recruited,
guess what that might lead us to?

30:32.530 --> 30:34.652
No way, Keno.

30:34.730 --> 30:36.889
Forget about it.

30:36.970 --> 30:40.490
Believe me, i really hate to say this,
but the kid's got a...

30:40.531 --> 30:42.932
- No!
- Why not?

30:43.010 --> 30:45.930
Too dangerous.

30:46.010 --> 30:47.410
But i thought we...

30:49.651 --> 30:50.571
Oh, man.

30:50.611 --> 30:53.131
Twenty.

30:53.211 --> 30:56.091
Twenty-one.
Twenty...

31:00.371 --> 31:02.412
One? Yeah.

31:09.090 --> 31:12.452
And these are the two most vicious
animals you could find?

31:13.491 --> 31:15.372
Good.

31:15.412 --> 31:18.011
- Professor?
- Preparations are complete, however...

31:18.092 --> 31:21.211
- Begin!
- I must re-register my protest...

31:21.291 --> 31:23.332
and remind you
of the immense danger if...

31:26.692 --> 31:29.812
That's enough talk from me.
We'll begin.

32:00.093 --> 32:02.573
Yes.

32:08.573 --> 32:11.053
- Clear.
- Go, go. Move.

32:18.174 --> 32:20.093
- See ya, April.
- Bye.

32:22.694 --> 32:23.853
Wish us luck.

32:28.493 --> 32:30.414
We'll be back for Splinter.

32:32.334 --> 32:36.053
The lives of two people don't amount
to a hill of beans in this crazy world.

32:36.093 --> 32:37.974
That's why you're
gettin' on that plane.

32:38.014 --> 32:40.294
- Maybe not today, maybe not to...
- Would you stop!

32:41.455 --> 32:42.735
See ya.

32:59.775 --> 33:02.815
All right, hold it.
This is stupid.

33:02.896 --> 33:04.814
We got the Foot up there
with the ooze...

33:04.855 --> 33:07.215
and we're down here
playing "Century 21."

33:07.255 --> 33:09.455
- Raph!
- Come on, Leo.

33:09.495 --> 33:12.015
Even you could think of something
better to do than this.

33:12.056 --> 33:14.935
i already have.
Now, let's get going!

33:15.015 --> 33:17.215
That's it.
i'm goin' up.

33:17.815 --> 33:21.136
- No, you're not!
- Let go of my arm, Leo.

33:21.176 --> 33:24.894
Guys, guys, guys!
i just got an idea.

33:24.975 --> 33:27.855
Two words that could solve
all our housing problems.

33:27.935 --> 33:31.095
Time share!

33:31.136 --> 33:34.015
- Not quite ripe yet.
- I'm outta here.

33:34.096 --> 33:36.655
But... Oh, man!

33:37.496 --> 33:39.855
Oh, boy.

33:41.135 --> 33:43.015
- Come on.
- Yeah.

33:43.095 --> 33:47.776
- Finding a home should be easy.
- But no!

33:47.856 --> 33:50.016
You'd think even an idiot
could find a place down here.

33:50.096 --> 33:51.537
But no...

33:53.616 --> 33:56.017
Oh, no!
Mikey, buddy!

33:56.096 --> 33:59.177
- Mikey, are you okay?
- Mikey!

33:59.255 --> 34:02.096
Check it out!

34:02.137 --> 34:03.457
Yeah!

34:03.537 --> 34:07.335
- Whoa!
- Okay, bro? Come on, Leo!

34:08.856 --> 34:10.856
- You all right?
- No prob.

34:19.416 --> 34:22.418
Power! Yeah.

34:25.456 --> 34:27.777
Oh, yeah!

34:29.897 --> 34:32.378
Look. I don't believe this.

34:34.378 --> 34:37.777
- Yes!
- Yes, yes!

34:40.697 --> 34:43.016
it's like spider city!

34:43.098 --> 34:45.098
Great!

34:45.177 --> 34:47.817
Rock-a-bye-baby.

34:47.898 --> 34:49.737
it's roomy!

34:49.818 --> 34:52.177
And it's well hidden, huh?

34:52.257 --> 34:54.178
So what do ya think?

34:55.737 --> 34:59.657
You know, i hear the sewers
in Connecticut are really nice.

34:59.738 --> 35:01.939
- Yeah. Come on.
- This is great!

35:07.579 --> 35:11.538
- How much longer?
- Look, i told you, i don't know.

35:11.618 --> 35:13.659
it takes time. Days!

35:13.738 --> 35:16.659
i want them
as soon as possible.

35:16.699 --> 35:19.579
- I told...
- Sit down!

35:19.658 --> 35:22.578
Aren't these enough
for your vengeance?

35:22.658 --> 35:25.778
The Foot have already
failed against them.

35:25.820 --> 35:28.020
i have failed.

35:29.898 --> 35:33.899
But the next time
will be different.

35:33.980 --> 35:38.420
The next fight will be
freak against freak!

35:42.860 --> 35:46.420
April, will you listen
just for a minute?

35:46.460 --> 35:48.339
it's a ratings week!

35:48.379 --> 35:51.699
Phil, i told you.
i am following up on TGRi.

35:51.780 --> 35:54.100
There's more going on there
than we know.

35:54.139 --> 35:57.618
Look, that story is over.
We need something solid.

35:57.699 --> 36:01.940
Something fresh.
i mean, like... like this.

36:01.979 --> 36:05.140
- She's busy right now.
- "Looking ahead.

36:05.181 --> 36:07.580
- Swimsuits in the '90s"?
- My interest is peaked.

36:07.620 --> 36:10.421
Phil, i gotta get going.

36:10.461 --> 36:12.459
You are always so busy.

36:12.540 --> 36:15.261
i'm the news manager here, April!

36:15.300 --> 36:18.100
April, there's a call for you.

36:19.501 --> 36:21.300
Tell them i'll call them back.

36:21.341 --> 36:24.700
He sounds pretty insistent.
Says his name's Donny.

36:24.780 --> 36:28.340
Listen, tell Donny that she's busy
with her news manager right now...

36:28.380 --> 36:29.900
and that she can't...

36:33.861 --> 36:37.100
Where are you guys?
Did you find a place to live yet?

36:37.181 --> 36:39.342
Oh, yeah, but i...

36:40.541 --> 36:43.380
it's not much right now,
but we'll bring you down.

36:43.420 --> 36:45.462
We've only really
had time to get Splinter...

36:45.501 --> 36:47.460
- And pick up a few essentials.
- Yeah!

36:47.541 --> 36:49.903
The bare essentials!

36:49.981 --> 36:52.902
Look, the reason why
we're calling is...

36:52.981 --> 36:55.781
have you seen Raphael
by any chance?

36:55.861 --> 36:57.701
Yeah. Has he stopped by
or anything?

36:57.782 --> 37:01.143
No. Why? Is he missing?

37:01.220 --> 37:05.622
You know, there's still more stuff
to help with, Michaelangelo!

37:05.661 --> 37:08.062
Hey, i'm helping Donny!
Give me the phone.

37:08.102 --> 37:10.581
Hey, give me that...

37:10.622 --> 37:13.782
- So you haven't seen him at all?
- No, I haven't.

37:13.822 --> 37:17.021
if she does, tell him thanks
for wasting our time!

37:17.062 --> 37:19.263
'Cause instead of looking
for the Foot and the ooze...

37:19.343 --> 37:21.181
like we should...

37:21.262 --> 37:25.023
we gotta go out and look
for him instead.

37:25.063 --> 37:30.302
- What was that?
- Leo says hi.

37:30.342 --> 37:32.222
- Donny, give me the phone.
- If you do hear something...

37:32.302 --> 37:35.502
- Let us know.
- I wanna talk to April! It's important!

37:35.583 --> 37:37.662
- Gimme, gimme, gimme!
- All right, here.

37:37.743 --> 37:40.863
April, it's Mikey.
i'd just like to say...

37:40.944 --> 37:43.863
- Hello.
- Would you give me that!

37:49.583 --> 37:52.183
The cells will
no longer hold them.

37:53.342 --> 37:56.064
Remove the bar.

37:56.105 --> 37:58.583
it's time they learn
who their master is.

38:00.464 --> 38:03.823
Remove the bar
and leave us.

38:11.265 --> 38:13.584
Come forth!

38:23.105 --> 38:27.665
Wolf. Snapping turtle.
incredible!

38:28.305 --> 38:30.424
Yes. Come forward.

38:30.465 --> 38:33.183
Attack me, if you will.

38:33.224 --> 38:36.584
When it is over,
you will call me "Master"!

38:45.745 --> 38:49.145
- Mama? Oh, Mama!
- Oh, Mama!

38:51.264 --> 38:54.585
- Mama.
- Mama.

38:54.624 --> 38:56.825
Get off me!

38:58.745 --> 39:00.825
Babies!

39:00.905 --> 39:03.545
They are babies!

39:06.146 --> 39:09.146
What did you expect?
They'd come out quoting Macbeth?

39:09.226 --> 39:13.026
- They are stupid!
- They're not stupid. They're infants.

39:16.546 --> 39:18.306
Okay, they're stupid infants.

39:21.266 --> 39:23.386
Put that down!

39:25.466 --> 39:29.546
Fortunately, they seem to have
imprinted you as their surrogate mother.

39:29.625 --> 39:33.347
- Mama.
- They are of no use to me against a...

39:35.267 --> 39:37.266
See that these two things...

39:37.345 --> 39:40.426
are properly disposed of.

39:40.506 --> 39:42.427
No. You can't do that.
They're living creatures.

39:43.746 --> 39:45.587
Not for long.

39:45.667 --> 39:48.746
Hey, no, no.
Wait, look.

39:50.187 --> 39:54.267
They may be
intellectually inferior, but...

39:58.346 --> 40:01.987
As you can see, they do have
other attributes.

40:05.547 --> 40:09.227
Maybe i'll keep them
around after all.

40:18.666 --> 40:21.188
- Hey, man, how's it going?
- Pretty good.

40:21.267 --> 40:23.346
- Good to see you, man.
- What's up?

40:23.426 --> 40:25.268
Did you just get here?

40:26.467 --> 40:28.587
Okay, guys.

40:28.668 --> 40:30.827
Listen up.

40:30.908 --> 40:33.507
i'm only going
to tell youse once.

40:33.587 --> 40:37.948
All of youse guys is gonna
have to take a little test.

40:37.989 --> 40:41.148
Then, if you're good enough...

40:41.188 --> 40:44.588
we let you into
the organization.

40:44.668 --> 40:47.909
Any questions?

40:47.989 --> 40:49.469
Okay, follow me.

40:49.509 --> 40:51.628
- Let's go.
- Lead the way, man.

41:02.508 --> 41:04.028
i knew this would work.

41:04.109 --> 41:07.669
just remember, we get you in,
we find the Foot headquarters...

41:07.748 --> 41:10.148
we get you out to tell
the others, right?

41:10.229 --> 41:12.710
Gee, maybe i should
write this down.

41:12.789 --> 41:14.829
What?

41:14.909 --> 41:16.990
i'm being punished, aren't i?

42:02.190 --> 42:04.431
- Keno, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

42:04.511 --> 42:07.110
You seem to be the only one
worthy of a final test.

42:09.231 --> 42:12.472
You'll have 15 seconds to remove
as many of the bells as you can.

42:13.350 --> 42:15.231
One sound and you fail.

42:15.271 --> 42:18.511
And another thing,
we work in concealment.

42:18.592 --> 42:20.471
Fifteen seconds.

42:20.552 --> 42:21.711
Go!

42:38.152 --> 42:39.232
is this enough?

42:41.831 --> 42:44.071
Yeah!

42:46.952 --> 42:48.793
Welcome to our headquarters.

42:50.671 --> 42:53.593
Get yourself a training dogi
and meet me back in the yard.

42:53.671 --> 42:55.113
Yeah, right.

43:05.351 --> 43:06.793
Keno, come on.

43:10.632 --> 43:13.473
Okay. Looks like
this is the place.

43:13.553 --> 43:15.433
Yeah, looks like it.

43:19.553 --> 43:22.594
First chance we get,
we're out of here.

43:22.673 --> 43:24.673
What? What is it?

43:26.832 --> 43:28.873
i thought i just saw a ghost.

43:30.433 --> 43:31.633
Come on.

43:32.553 --> 43:36.034
- What are we looking for anyway?
- Quiet. You want to get us...

43:38.233 --> 43:39.712
caught?

43:39.793 --> 43:40.793
Yeah, well...

43:42.193 --> 43:46.193
Hi. We were lookin' for
a muffler for a '77 Chevy.

43:49.193 --> 43:51.835
Whatever happened
to service with a smile?

43:54.274 --> 43:55.393
Yeah!

44:00.074 --> 44:03.754
Get out of here kid.
Go tell the others. Go now!

44:03.793 --> 44:06.154
Hey, nice shot.

44:06.234 --> 44:08.074
You're good.
Come on.

44:10.914 --> 44:13.315
- I'm not gonna just...
- Run, or i'll kick your butt.

44:17.435 --> 44:19.875
Move!
Come on, you guys!

44:26.795 --> 44:29.516
Excuse me.
Pardon me.

44:32.393 --> 44:34.994
Come on.

44:35.075 --> 44:36.395
Missed.

44:38.355 --> 44:40.235
i'm curious.

44:40.276 --> 44:44.395
Any of you guys ever heard
the expression "fair fight"?

44:46.795 --> 44:49.235
You know, pal,
if i had a face like yours...

44:49.316 --> 44:52.596
i'd try to make up for it
with some sort of a personality.

45:11.116 --> 45:15.398
Come on.
Come on, April, Leo!

45:15.437 --> 45:17.516
if you're there,
it's me, Keno.

45:17.596 --> 45:21.517
Darn. Come on.
Raph's in trouble.

45:24.357 --> 45:25.956
April, where are they?

45:26.036 --> 45:28.636
- It's Raph.
- Wait, calm down. What happened?

45:28.716 --> 45:30.757
i've gotta tell the guys.
They got him!

45:30.836 --> 45:32.717
Who has got him?

45:42.477 --> 45:44.318
Come on.

45:45.356 --> 45:48.118
- Just like Keno said.
- Yeah.

45:48.196 --> 45:50.358
- The perimeter's quiet.
- Yeah.

45:50.438 --> 45:52.956
A little too quiet.

45:53.037 --> 45:55.558
- Come on.
- Okay.

46:07.918 --> 46:09.399
Knock, knock.

46:13.076 --> 46:16.358
- Well, that was easy.
- Yeah, a little too easy.

46:21.997 --> 46:24.317
Look, it's Raph!

46:24.398 --> 46:26.519
Yeah, a little too Raph.

46:26.597 --> 46:30.198
You guys, knock it off.
Keep your eyes peeled.

46:30.278 --> 46:32.199
i don't like this.

46:32.278 --> 46:33.478
- Let's go.
- Right.

46:46.438 --> 46:48.999
You know, given the layout
of this junkyard...

46:49.039 --> 46:51.079
and the proximity
of certain structures...

46:51.118 --> 46:53.039
if they were gonna
spring a trap...

46:53.079 --> 46:56.039
they'd probably do it
right about...

46:59.958 --> 47:01.959
Let us out of here!

47:02.039 --> 47:03.799
What the...

47:08.279 --> 47:10.759
The Shred dude!
it's him!

47:10.839 --> 47:14.159
i've been waiting for you.

47:14.200 --> 47:16.839
i have a little surprise.

47:18.360 --> 47:22.760
- Oh, no.
- I don't like this.

47:22.840 --> 47:24.718
i wonder what those are for.

47:24.759 --> 47:27.640
Does the word "turtle-kabob"
mean anything to you?

47:27.720 --> 47:31.201
Yeah, right!
Get your arm out of my face.

47:34.400 --> 47:37.720
Patience.
First them...

47:37.800 --> 47:41.161
then you.

47:41.241 --> 47:44.120
You know, these nets
are remarkably effective.

47:44.200 --> 47:46.040
Very well constructed.

47:46.120 --> 47:49.160
Remind me to drop a line
to Ralph Nader!

47:49.201 --> 47:52.521
Wait for my signal
to drop them.

47:55.120 --> 47:57.041
i never got to see Paris.

47:57.081 --> 47:59.961
A little closer.

48:00.040 --> 48:02.281
A little closer!

48:02.321 --> 48:04.802
Oh, we're almost there!

48:06.322 --> 48:07.762
Get ready!

48:14.361 --> 48:17.322
Cowabunga!

48:17.401 --> 48:19.840
That's right, Shredder.
You forgot.

48:19.920 --> 48:23.882
- We carry insurance.
- Mutual of Splinter, dude.

48:23.922 --> 48:25.921
Get them!

48:39.761 --> 48:41.883
Why don't you just
rip my lips off?

48:41.962 --> 48:44.802
- You'd think...
- Enough.

48:44.883 --> 48:46.922
Here, let me get this first.

48:58.683 --> 49:01.162
Can we talk?

49:01.204 --> 49:02.482
Guess not!

49:04.804 --> 49:06.883
Pitiful.

49:15.403 --> 49:16.523
You win.

49:19.844 --> 49:22.564
- Looks like we're on our own.
- All right!

49:22.644 --> 49:24.683
Tokka!

49:24.723 --> 49:26.963
Rahzar!

49:37.964 --> 49:40.164
Didn't we see these guys
on Wrestlemania?

49:40.245 --> 49:43.924
Prove yourselves to me!
Attack!

49:46.044 --> 49:48.325
Well, you know
what they say.

49:48.403 --> 49:50.245
The bigger they are...

49:53.765 --> 49:55.324
The more bones
they break.

49:58.805 --> 50:01.764
- These guys are mine.
- Go get 'em, Donny.

50:01.845 --> 50:05.446
All right, you overgrown,
ugly excuse for a turtle!

50:11.283 --> 50:15.684
You know, maybe that "ugly" crack
was a little bit out of line.

50:23.886 --> 50:26.286
Oh, that hurt!

50:29.005 --> 50:31.485
Hey, you're that TGRi guy.

50:31.566 --> 50:33.405
Hang on.

50:35.525 --> 50:39.765
- I've got to get the hang of that.
- It's okay.

50:39.845 --> 50:42.326
i'm gonna get you
out of here.

50:58.445 --> 50:59.566
What?

51:01.806 --> 51:03.887
Oh, am i glad to see you!

51:06.527 --> 51:10.446
- Hey, guys, over here!
- Yeah! We're on our way.

51:11.927 --> 51:15.206
Come on, Professor.
We don't have a lot of time.

51:15.286 --> 51:19.847
- Hey, Mikey, we got the TGRi guy.
- Come on, come on.

51:19.926 --> 51:23.247
- Well, actually, i'd rather not.
- Come on!

51:25.047 --> 51:27.566
Step up to the bar, boys!

51:31.328 --> 51:33.206
This way, Leo.
Come on.

51:34.047 --> 51:35.568
You all right, Doc?

51:35.608 --> 51:38.807
- Way to go, Mikey!
- Come on. You go next.

51:38.848 --> 51:40.288
Come here.

51:41.367 --> 51:43.607
- Come on, Raph.
- Yeah, yeah.

51:45.168 --> 51:46.288
Stop them!

51:51.007 --> 51:54.248
- Drop right in, Leo.
- All right!

52:07.128 --> 52:09.968
Hey, look at this!

52:19.768 --> 52:20.768
Stupid!

52:23.129 --> 52:25.769
Come on. We gotta
meet back up with Splinter.

52:25.849 --> 52:27.369
Yeah.

52:30.209 --> 52:33.369
Four walking, talking turtles!

52:36.168 --> 52:39.249
Yeah, the guy's Ph.D. material,
all right.

52:39.289 --> 52:42.129
You're so intelligent.
it's incredible.

52:42.169 --> 52:45.568
Don't freak, dude.
We can explain. You see...

52:45.649 --> 52:47.689
Fifteen years ago,
you came into contact...

52:47.770 --> 52:49.969
with a green colloidal gel
down in a sewer...

52:50.009 --> 52:53.409
which transformed you
into your present state.

52:54.489 --> 52:55.888
Fantastic!

52:56.449 --> 52:59.249
There you go.
Come on. Yeah.

52:59.289 --> 53:00.810
Amazing, guys.

53:00.889 --> 53:04.370
i thought all the really
good dungeons were in Europe.

53:04.451 --> 53:06.169
There you go, dude.

53:09.290 --> 53:11.892
- This is wonderful!
- Yeah, okay.

53:11.930 --> 53:15.889
We'll give you the tour later.
Right now we've got a few questions.

53:15.930 --> 53:20.291
- A few inquiries.
- Yeah, a few...

53:20.371 --> 53:23.729
- We'll give you a tour later.
- Give him room to speak.

53:26.010 --> 53:29.011
The professor has much
to tell us.

53:36.571 --> 53:38.531
Of course, laboratories
were crude back then...

53:38.612 --> 53:41.610
and an accident was
just waiting to happen.

53:41.690 --> 53:45.051
Wait a minute.
You mean to tell us...

53:45.131 --> 53:48.812
that the formation of the ooze
was all just a big mistake?

53:48.891 --> 53:50.851
Let me see.

53:50.931 --> 53:53.492
Donatello, isn't it?

53:53.532 --> 53:56.092
An unknown mixture
of discarded chemicals...

53:56.172 --> 53:59.850
was accidentally exposed
to a series of radiated waves...

53:59.931 --> 54:03.211
and the resulting ooze
was found to have remarkable...

54:03.291 --> 54:06.733
but dangerous
mutanagenic properties.

54:08.571 --> 54:09.851
Big mistake.

54:14.132 --> 54:17.412
- Please continue, Professor.
- Yeah.

54:17.492 --> 54:20.052
Well, on our way to bury them,
a near collision caused us...

54:20.091 --> 54:24.492
to lose one of the canisters
down a sewer 15 years ago.

54:24.572 --> 54:28.052
Professor Perry,
what's happening at TGRi now?

54:28.972 --> 54:30.892
i imagine they're trying
to remove any evidence...

54:30.972 --> 54:33.413
of the disposal process
and evacuate the premises...

54:33.493 --> 54:36.372
which is standard procedure
when a mishap occurs.

54:36.413 --> 54:41.774
And as we know, one or two
rather big mishaps have occurred.

54:41.853 --> 54:45.133
Yeah.
Tokka, Rahzar and the Shredder.

54:45.212 --> 54:48.492
And he's obsessed
with destroying you all.

54:48.573 --> 54:51.493
Yeah, we got that impression,
all right.

54:51.574 --> 54:52.933
- Michaelangelo.
- Yeah?

54:53.014 --> 54:55.372
- Show the professor where he may rest.
- Righty-o!

54:56.374 --> 54:58.092
This way, dude.

54:58.173 --> 55:06.053
it ain't the Hilton. Let's face it. You'd
be better off staying at the Hilton.

55:12.613 --> 55:16.654
What troubles you, my son?

55:16.733 --> 55:20.853
i don't know. I just always thought
there'd be more to it...

55:20.893 --> 55:22.852
to the ooze...

55:22.934 --> 55:26.095
to, you know, us!

55:26.175 --> 55:28.134
i know.

55:28.214 --> 55:34.414
i always thought
there'd be something. i thought we'd
find out we were special.

55:35.135 --> 55:39.213
Do not confuse the specter
of your origin...

55:39.294 --> 55:41.575
with your present worth,
my sons.

55:41.654 --> 55:45.935
i don't believe him!
There's just got to be more to it!

55:46.016 --> 55:48.694
Perhaps the search
for a beginning...

55:48.734 --> 55:52.656
rarely has so easy an end.

55:52.734 --> 55:55.816
But our search
will have to wait.

55:55.895 --> 55:59.695
Tonight's encounter
has left us with...

55:59.776 --> 56:02.215
larger problems.

56:06.216 --> 56:07.134
i got 'em.

56:15.216 --> 56:19.056
Go. Play. Have fun.

56:19.134 --> 56:20.976
Fun!

56:24.456 --> 56:28.055
Tonight we leave a calling card
for the turtles.

56:28.095 --> 56:32.816
Tomorrow we force
a final confrontation.

56:58.177 --> 57:01.817
- Master say have fun!
- Fun!

57:03.457 --> 57:05.297
Look, Sophie.

57:05.377 --> 57:07.817
Some animals are knocking down
the telephone poles.

57:07.897 --> 57:09.977
What do we do
if they come over here?

57:10.018 --> 57:12.496
Let them get
their own cab.

57:24.418 --> 57:26.258
Damage is minimal.

57:26.337 --> 57:29.616
And as always, our official report
will be released...

57:29.698 --> 57:31.538
after a thorough investigation.

57:31.618 --> 57:33.458
Thank you, Miss O'Neil.

57:33.538 --> 57:36.338
i have no further comments
at this time.

57:36.418 --> 57:38.258
We will be in touch.

57:38.337 --> 57:41.657
More as it develops.
Here you go.

57:41.697 --> 57:44.579
Chief Sterns, i wonder
if i might ask you...

57:44.618 --> 57:46.779
a few more questions
off-the-record.

57:46.818 --> 57:48.777
Miss O'Neil, my record,
on-the-record...

57:48.858 --> 57:51.898
clearly shows that i have
no off-the-record record.

57:51.978 --> 57:55.019
- Make a record of that.
- Wait.

57:56.059 --> 57:59.099
Were there any large tooth
or claw marks found here today?

57:59.139 --> 58:01.018
How did you know...

58:01.859 --> 58:04.539
that i don't know
what you're talking about?

58:04.579 --> 58:08.379
i have reason to believe
this damage was caused by two... two...

58:08.458 --> 58:11.058
really big animals.

58:11.139 --> 58:14.300
And what type of animals
might these be, Miss O'Neil?

58:14.339 --> 58:16.738
- Well, i can't say exactly.
- I see.

58:16.818 --> 58:19.260
Then what leads you
to believe they did this?

58:19.299 --> 58:22.260
i can't say that either, but...

58:22.340 --> 58:25.019
Anything else you'd
like not to tell me?

58:25.060 --> 58:28.100
Sterns, there are two very
dangerous things out there!

58:28.179 --> 58:31.579
And just what exactly
would you like me to do about it?

58:33.379 --> 58:37.180
i don't know.
i guess you're not the ones...

58:37.220 --> 58:39.100
that are gonna have
to handle this.

58:39.901 --> 58:42.299
That's what we do best,
Miss O'Neil.

58:43.779 --> 58:46.300
Have a nice day.

58:46.341 --> 58:48.379
Get sanitation
down here.

58:48.420 --> 58:50.581
Get this place
cleaned up.

58:56.220 --> 58:58.461
- Where's Freddy?
- He took off. Said he was sick.

58:58.500 --> 59:01.420
- What do you need?
- Nothing. I can get it.

59:17.381 --> 59:19.300
Hello, April.

59:19.381 --> 59:21.181
Freddy?

59:23.581 --> 59:27.902
Our master has a message
for your friends.

59:37.420 --> 59:39.901
- Are you sure you weren't...
- They're not following me.

59:39.941 --> 59:42.340
They don't need to.

59:45.181 --> 59:47.742
They said
if you don't meet them...

59:47.781 --> 59:51.501
at the construction
site tonight...

59:51.581 --> 59:53.502
What?

59:53.582 --> 59:56.221
he'd send Tokka
and Rahzar out again.

59:56.302 --> 59:58.181
This time
into Central Park.

59:58.222 --> 01:00:01.102
Oh, man! Central Park?

01:00:01.182 --> 01:00:06.182
How are they going
to avoid all those people?

01:00:06.262 --> 01:00:09.543
Then there is no choice...

01:00:09.582 --> 01:00:13.023
but to meet as
the Shredder wishes.

01:00:15.102 --> 01:00:16.463
He's just trying
to force you guys...

01:00:16.543 --> 01:00:19.303
- Into fighting Tokka and Rahzar again.
- We know.

01:00:19.383 --> 01:00:22.224
- You can't!
- April, there's no other way.

01:00:22.302 --> 01:00:26.063
- You guys don't stand a chance.
- Wait!

01:00:26.143 --> 01:00:29.543
Wait just a minute.

01:00:29.623 --> 01:00:31.543
There might be a way.

01:00:34.863 --> 01:00:37.823
- Temperature?
- 338 Kelvin.

01:00:37.903 --> 01:00:41.462
Michaelangelo, pass me
the dimethyl chlorinide.

01:00:41.543 --> 01:00:42.623
That.

01:00:42.663 --> 01:00:45.984
You know, not to criticize
science or anything...

01:00:46.062 --> 01:00:49.744
but wouldn't it be easier
to call it "the pink one"?

01:00:54.023 --> 01:00:56.064
Donatello,
continue aeration.

01:00:56.104 --> 01:00:58.144
Continuing aeration.

01:00:59.623 --> 01:01:02.663
Man!
This stuff is rank.

01:01:02.743 --> 01:01:05.224
Yeah, try carrying it
on the subway sometime.

01:01:05.305 --> 01:01:07.624
i never got a seat
so fast in my life.

01:01:08.784 --> 01:01:11.983
- Thanks for doing the shopping for us.
- No problem.

01:01:12.064 --> 01:01:14.385
i hope you didn't mind me
picking up a few pies.

01:01:14.465 --> 01:01:16.464
You're forgiven.

01:01:25.745 --> 01:01:27.624
Are you sure
this stuff will work?

01:01:27.664 --> 01:01:30.824
When i contaminated the ooze
used to transform Tokka and Rahzar...

01:01:30.905 --> 01:01:33.585
making them intellectually inferior
and less dangerous...

01:01:33.665 --> 01:01:34.585
i had no idea...

01:01:34.665 --> 01:01:38.145
i'd be trying to create an anti-mutagen
based on that contamination.

01:01:38.184 --> 01:01:41.186
Oh, anti-mutagen.

01:01:41.264 --> 01:01:43.147
- What?
- He's not sure.

01:01:45.106 --> 01:01:48.225
Pepperoni heaven!

01:01:48.266 --> 01:01:51.026
Gentlemen, may i have
your attention?

01:01:51.106 --> 01:01:54.346
- Leonardo, hand me a glass, please?
- Oh, yeah. Sure.

01:01:54.387 --> 01:01:56.265
i got it.

01:01:56.305 --> 01:01:59.066
Are you sure this stuff
will do the trick?

01:01:59.145 --> 01:02:01.506
We won't know until
we spray those guys.

01:02:01.546 --> 01:02:04.866
- Well, actually...
- "Actually" what?

01:02:04.945 --> 01:02:07.386
Actually...

01:02:07.465 --> 01:02:09.706
ingestion is
the only course.

01:02:09.746 --> 01:02:12.786
- What?
- You mean, they have to eat it?

01:02:13.986 --> 01:02:15.186
Affirmative.

01:02:15.266 --> 01:02:19.106
Yes. Right on, my man.

01:02:19.147 --> 01:02:21.826
Great!
That should be easy.

01:02:21.907 --> 01:02:23.906
Any ideas?

01:02:23.985 --> 01:02:26.826
We could solidify it
in ice-cube trays.

01:02:26.907 --> 01:02:28.987
Well, i've got an idea.

01:02:48.747 --> 01:02:50.587
Hey, is this gonna work?

01:02:50.668 --> 01:02:54.747
is, like, Schwarzenegger
hard to spell?

01:02:54.828 --> 01:02:55.908
Yeah.

01:03:05.907 --> 01:03:07.987
- Pretty quiet.
- Yeah.

01:03:08.066 --> 01:03:11.068
Shredder!

01:03:11.147 --> 01:03:14.147
Thanks, Raph. I may never
have the hiccups again.

01:03:23.787 --> 01:03:24.948
Welcome.

01:03:25.029 --> 01:03:26.866
All we need now is...

01:03:26.948 --> 01:03:30.548
- Wide World of Sports and a blimp.
- How ironic.

01:03:30.629 --> 01:03:33.028
The very thing
that was your making...

01:03:33.069 --> 01:03:36.308
will now be your undoing.

01:03:36.389 --> 01:03:38.669
Tokka! Rahzar!

01:03:38.708 --> 01:03:42.149
Let the games begin!

01:03:55.268 --> 01:03:57.188
Watch out.

01:04:00.309 --> 01:04:03.068
What? Leo, come here!

01:04:04.869 --> 01:04:07.469
Come on! Go get 'em!

01:04:07.549 --> 01:04:08.550
Wait!

01:04:08.590 --> 01:04:10.310
Wait!

01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:16.030
First we should observe
the ancient ritual of the...

01:04:16.110 --> 01:04:19.990
- Traditional pre-fight doughnut.
- Yeah.

01:04:20.069 --> 01:04:21.508
Pre-fight doughnut?

01:04:28.110 --> 01:04:32.469
- Why did i let you talk me into this?
- Give it a chance.

01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:35.711
Hi, guys.

01:04:35.790 --> 01:04:38.870
- It's not gonna work.
- Yes, it is. They'll eat anything.

01:04:45.071 --> 01:04:47.031
Oh, yes!

01:04:50.031 --> 01:04:52.030
Nummers. Yeah.

01:04:52.110 --> 01:04:54.152
Good boy.
A little drooly.

01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:57.351
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah! Good boy.

01:05:02.351 --> 01:05:04.991
- Yeah, right.
- Go on.

01:05:06.671 --> 01:05:09.631
Here you go. Yeah.

01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:12.392
in your mouth.
Wolf it down! Scarf it!

01:05:12.431 --> 01:05:16.231
- Have another.
- Eat it. Yeah. It'll be great!

01:05:24.431 --> 01:05:27.832
- They found the cubes.
- I told you it wasn't gonna work.

01:05:27.911 --> 01:05:29.352
Get them!

01:05:31.112 --> 01:05:32.473
i never touched it!

01:05:35.792 --> 01:05:39.072
Can't we talk this out?
No, wait! Wait!

01:05:42.312 --> 01:05:44.231
Major spin cycle!

01:05:49.233 --> 01:05:51.113
Hey, Leo!

01:05:51.192 --> 01:05:52.712
Mikey?

01:05:55.792 --> 01:05:59.553
Maybe i should've
brought bagels!

01:06:03.752 --> 01:06:06.273
Now i know what a postal
package feels like.

01:06:06.352 --> 01:06:07.753
Hey, Mikey, you okay?

01:06:07.833 --> 01:06:10.473
- You take the ugly one.
- No, you take the ugly one.

01:06:10.554 --> 01:06:13.952
- I'll take the ugly one!
- Which one's the ugly one?

01:06:29.275 --> 01:06:31.552
Get back! Go on! Go on!

01:06:31.632 --> 01:06:33.874
Hey, come here.

01:06:38.833 --> 01:06:40.672
You want some more?
Come on.

01:06:40.753 --> 01:06:45.034
Look at those costumes!
i love this place!

01:06:46.354 --> 01:06:48.714
Hey, you!
Table for one!

01:06:59.635 --> 01:07:02.235
Man, could this
get any worse?

01:07:04.635 --> 01:07:06.514
Oh, foul!

01:07:06.554 --> 01:07:08.355
Nasty!

01:07:09.234 --> 01:07:11.755
Hey, nice tie, bro.
Do you mind? Come on!

01:07:21.595 --> 01:07:23.756
Big brown ugly dude,
i'm over here.

01:07:23.795 --> 01:07:25.914
Try to get me.

01:07:27.834 --> 01:07:28.995
Yo, it's
the green machine

01:07:29.075 --> 01:07:31.356
Gonna rock the town
without bein'seen

01:07:31.435 --> 01:07:33.516
Have you ever seen
a turtle get down

01:07:33.594 --> 01:07:36.475
Slammin'and jammin'to the new
swing sound, yeah, everybody

01:07:36.555 --> 01:07:38.916
Let's move, Vanilla is here
with the NewJack groove

01:07:38.996 --> 01:07:43.035
Gonna rock and roll the place
with the power of the ninja turtle bass

01:07:43.115 --> 01:07:44.914
Iceman, you know
I'm not playin'

01:07:44.996 --> 01:07:46.475
Devastate the show...

01:07:46.556 --> 01:07:49.556
- Professor!
- It would appear the anti-mutagen...

01:07:49.636 --> 01:07:52.435
- Has been somewhat ineffective.
- No kidding.

01:07:52.475 --> 01:07:54.635
We've gotta do something.
Come on.

01:07:54.716 --> 01:07:56.515
Go, ninja
Go, ninja, go

01:07:56.596 --> 01:07:58.475
Go, ninja
Go, ninja, go

01:07:58.516 --> 01:08:00.397
Go, ninja
Go, ninja, go

01:08:03.436 --> 01:08:06.195
What is this?
i didn't order any extras.

01:08:06.276 --> 01:08:07.998
- Did you order any extras?
- Well...

01:08:08.076 --> 01:08:10.236
Where did these
extras come from?

01:08:10.316 --> 01:08:12.756
Get me a phone.
i want the police. Now.

01:08:12.836 --> 01:08:15.237
Phone. Police.
Go! Hurry up!

01:08:15.796 --> 01:08:17.636
Nice swing!

01:08:17.718 --> 01:08:20.236
This is bad.
Carbon dioxide...

01:08:20.317 --> 01:08:23.277
is essential to
the anti-mutanagenic process.

01:08:23.317 --> 01:08:26.997
Their burping is probably
retarding the reaction.

01:08:27.078 --> 01:08:29.076
isn't there any way
to speed it back up?

01:08:29.156 --> 01:08:33.397
The reintroduction of CO2
could act as a catalyst.

01:08:33.437 --> 01:08:36.796
- The problem is finding a ready supply.
- Yeah.

01:08:42.357 --> 01:08:45.317
Genius. Pure genius.

01:08:57.397 --> 01:09:00.517
i can't take this anymore!

01:09:00.598 --> 01:09:02.438
We should be out there
with the guys!

01:09:02.517 --> 01:09:06.598
No. You have youth.
i have experience.

01:09:06.678 --> 01:09:09.277
But only those
who now fight have both.

01:09:09.358 --> 01:09:12.957
- But i can fight.
- They fight because they must...

01:09:13.038 --> 01:09:16.639
but it is the last choice
for the true ninja.

01:09:16.719 --> 01:09:20.917
Used unwisely, it becomes
a double-edged sword.

01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:25.678
Look, i know you're trying to help me,
but you can't keep me here.

01:09:28.959 --> 01:09:30.919
i cannot.

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:40.997
You sure about this,
Donny?

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:44.319
- Don't worry. Just do it.
- Right.

01:09:44.399 --> 01:09:47.399
Come on, guys. Come on.

01:09:47.479 --> 01:09:48.840
Come on, come on.

01:09:51.158 --> 01:09:52.639
Over here, big guy.

01:09:52.719 --> 01:09:54.719
- Okay, Mikey?
- Yeah!

01:09:54.801 --> 01:09:56.320
Raph, now!

01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:58.000
Rock and roll!

01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:03.520
- Do it, Donny.
- Open wide!

01:10:03.598 --> 01:10:06.240
- Say "ahh."
- Go, ninja, go, ninja, go

01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:08.079
Go, ninja
Go, ninja, go

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.519
i think it's working!

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:18.799
These dudes are copping
major Z's already.

01:10:18.879 --> 01:10:21.560
- All right!
- Yeah!

01:10:23.961 --> 01:10:24.840
What?

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:27.360
- It's the police.
- The police? What are you doing?

01:10:27.441 --> 01:10:30.320
They like it.
They like it!

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:34.201
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- It's okay. They like it.

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:36.001
The Foot!

01:10:36.082 --> 01:10:38.440
it's party time, boys!

01:10:40.961 --> 01:10:43.802
i win. You lose.

01:10:43.882 --> 01:10:46.560
It's the green machine gonna rock
the town without bein'seen

01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:48.640
Have you ever seen
a turtle get down

01:10:48.721 --> 01:10:50.681
Slammin'and jammin'
to the new swing sound

01:10:50.762 --> 01:10:53.362
One kick, two kick,
three kick, four!

01:10:53.402 --> 01:10:56.280
We're gonna
rock and roll the place

01:10:56.321 --> 01:10:58.281
With the power of
the ninja turtle bass

01:10:58.361 --> 01:11:00.361
Iceman, you know
I'm not playin'

01:11:00.441 --> 01:11:02.442
Devastate the show
while the turtles are sayin'

01:11:02.522 --> 01:11:05.121
Ninja, ninja rap

01:11:07.122 --> 01:11:10.121
Wishbone crunch on two!
Hutt, hutt, wow!

01:11:10.202 --> 01:11:12.042
Villains, you better
run and hide

01:11:12.122 --> 01:11:13.441
Because one day
you might not slide

01:11:13.521 --> 01:11:16.322
So choose your weapon
Don't slip

01:11:23.803 --> 01:11:27.322
Ninja, ninja, rap
Ninja, ninja, rap

01:11:27.403 --> 01:11:29.202
Go, go, go, go

01:11:29.242 --> 01:11:31.243
Go, ninja
Go, ninja, go

01:11:31.324 --> 01:11:33.122
Go, ninja
Go, ninja, go

01:11:33.203 --> 01:11:35.122
Go, ninja
Go, ninja, go

01:11:35.201 --> 01:11:37.082
Go, ninja
Go, ninja, go

01:11:37.163 --> 01:11:39.922
Go, go, go, go

01:11:39.963 --> 01:11:41.963
Go, go, go, go
Ninja, ninja go

01:11:51.843 --> 01:11:52.802
Sock it to me, baby!

01:11:52.882 --> 01:11:56.324
Go, go, go, go
Ninja, ninja, rap

01:11:56.402 --> 01:11:59.482
Ninja, ninja, rap

01:11:59.562 --> 01:12:01.884
We're shakin'! Yeah!

01:12:01.923 --> 01:12:04.003
You like what you saw?

01:12:04.084 --> 01:12:06.484
Then give it up
for us turtles!

01:12:06.564 --> 01:12:08.443
Go, ninja
Go, ninja, go

01:12:08.483 --> 01:12:10.003
Yeah!

01:12:10.043 --> 01:12:12.963
Ninja! Ninja!

01:12:20.803 --> 01:12:22.763
We're not through yet!

01:12:23.644 --> 01:12:26.085
just save yourself
the trouble, Shredder. It's all over.

01:12:26.164 --> 01:12:30.524
The battle is yours,
but the war is far from over.

01:12:30.604 --> 01:12:33.204
Not so long
as i possess this.

01:12:33.285 --> 01:12:35.165
The green stuff.

01:12:35.246 --> 01:12:37.603
- Hand it over, Shredder.
- Of course.

01:12:37.684 --> 01:12:41.924
in small doses
through future mutants.

01:12:42.005 --> 01:12:45.124
- You'll have to get through us first!
- Yeah!

01:12:45.204 --> 01:12:47.123
A pleasure.

01:12:48.004 --> 01:12:50.645
Guys, i'm here.
Get out of my way.

01:12:50.724 --> 01:12:53.486
- Get out! Watch out!
- Let us handle it, Keno.

01:12:57.644 --> 01:12:58.925
Let me go!

01:12:59.965 --> 01:13:01.605
Keno, stay back.

01:13:01.686 --> 01:13:03.444
- Raph, get on my back.
- Fool!

01:13:05.845 --> 01:13:08.805
- Back!
- You're not going anywhere, Shredder!

01:13:08.886 --> 01:13:11.366
On the contrary.
We're going somewhere.

01:13:11.444 --> 01:13:13.604
- Donny, come on!
- If you try to stop us...

01:13:13.685 --> 01:13:15.765
i'll cover her with this.

01:13:16.445 --> 01:13:18.126
Let me go.
i can take him! Come on!

01:13:18.206 --> 01:13:20.406
Full volume.

01:13:20.485 --> 01:13:22.405
Keno, it's not your fight.

01:13:22.486 --> 01:13:25.126
- Hit it, Mikey!
- Rock and roll!

01:13:34.885 --> 01:13:36.286
is she all right?

01:13:36.326 --> 01:13:39.926
- Keno, i told you...
- I know. This is not my fight.

01:13:39.967 --> 01:13:41.926
- At last!
- Come on. Let's go.

01:13:42.006 --> 01:13:44.646
- I'm coming.
- I learned that from a rat.

01:13:44.726 --> 01:13:46.125
Later, Keno, dude!

01:13:50.527 --> 01:13:53.487
Tokka and Rahzar.
How cute.

01:13:53.567 --> 01:13:57.246
Hey. We could make
a fortune in the diet racket.

01:13:57.327 --> 01:13:58.966
Oh, Mikey.

01:14:00.046 --> 01:14:03.126
- Maybe he set a distance record.
- Doubtful.

01:14:03.167 --> 01:14:05.047
Hey, where'd he go?

01:14:09.446 --> 01:14:12.366
- Anything?
- Nothing.

01:14:12.447 --> 01:14:16.247
Well, dudes, i'd say
that's pretty much a wrap.

01:14:16.327 --> 01:14:18.887
Cowabunga?

01:14:18.966 --> 01:14:21.007
- Cowabunga!
- Yeah!

01:14:21.088 --> 01:14:23.248
Cowabunga!

01:14:40.608 --> 01:14:45.807
- The last vial of ooze!
- He must have drank all of it.

01:14:45.887 --> 01:14:48.368
it's a super Shredder.

01:14:59.288 --> 01:15:02.169
Great! Now what
are we supposed to do?

01:15:05.888 --> 01:15:09.449
This thing can't take much more of this,
not with all that stuff on top.

01:15:12.248 --> 01:15:14.808
Shredder, you got
to listen to reason!

01:15:14.889 --> 01:15:16.888
You're gonna
destroy us all!

01:15:18.929 --> 01:15:21.048
Then so be it!

01:15:21.969 --> 01:15:23.450
You okay?

01:15:25.249 --> 01:15:27.569
it's all coming down!

01:15:27.649 --> 01:15:29.129
Watch your head, guys!

01:15:30.890 --> 01:15:32.689
We're pancakes!

01:15:36.450 --> 01:15:39.768
A true ninja is a master
of himself and his environment.

01:15:39.849 --> 01:15:43.530
So don't forget.
We're turtles!

01:16:26.331 --> 01:16:29.091
i've said it before,
and i'll say it again.

01:16:29.132 --> 01:16:33.250
"Man, i love
being a turtle!"

01:16:33.332 --> 01:16:35.931
- Too bad the Shredder can't say that.
- Yeah.

01:16:36.611 --> 01:16:39.052
- Look!
- Wha...

01:16:39.130 --> 01:16:41.531
it can't be.

01:16:41.611 --> 01:16:44.491
Nobody could
have survived that.

01:16:49.532 --> 01:16:51.612
That's the end
of the Shredder.

01:16:51.692 --> 01:16:54.490
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:16:54.530 --> 01:16:56.932
And in a bizarre
final note...

01:16:57.011 --> 01:16:59.413
to the mysterious
disappearance of TGRI...

01:16:59.492 --> 01:17:03.691
this message was delivered
to the station earlier today.

01:17:03.771 --> 01:17:08.252
'"To Leonardo,
Michaelangelo, Raphael...

01:17:08.292 --> 01:17:10.693
- And Donatello...
- Idiots.

01:17:10.771 --> 01:17:14.332
thanks for
your help, dudes.

01:17:14.412 --> 01:17:16.573
Signed,
ProfessorJordan Perry. "

01:17:17.452 --> 01:17:20.172
Of course we can only
guess at its meaning.

01:17:21.132 --> 01:17:22.573
And now this.

01:17:26.133 --> 01:17:27.973
Bodacious!

01:17:28.053 --> 01:17:31.333
- Ostentatious!
- Hey, hey, spacious!

01:17:31.373 --> 01:17:34.093
Hey, dudes!
Cowabunga says it all!

01:17:34.173 --> 01:17:36.853
Cowabunga!

01:17:36.933 --> 01:17:38.772
Oh, yeah!

01:17:39.813 --> 01:17:42.334
We're home.

01:17:43.372 --> 01:17:45.374
Were you seen?

01:17:45.414 --> 01:17:47.613
- Of course not, Master Splinter.
- We practice ninja.

01:17:47.693 --> 01:17:49.693
The art of invisibility.

01:17:53.894 --> 01:17:55.814
Practice harder.

01:17:58.212 --> 01:18:01.013
Ten flips now!
And remember...

01:18:01.094 --> 01:18:03.054
"Go, ninja
Go, ninja, go!"

01:18:04.054 --> 01:18:14.054
i made another funny!
