00:57.992 --> 01:00.119

02:40.261 --> 02:42.513
- Freddie!
-I dropped something.

02:42.805 --> 02:44.307
Ralph, talk to him.

02:45.391 --> 02:47.226
Listen to your father.

02:47.769 --> 02:49.687
Come on.
From there we can see Cape Cod.

02:49.771 --> 02:50.813
We were just on Cape Cod.

02:51.355 --> 02:53.733
We could have stayed there.
I would've saved $12.

02:54.150 --> 02:56.903
Allen, don't you want to see Cape Cod?

02:58.362 --> 03:01.908
All right, darling. You know
where we are if you change your mind.

03:19.884 --> 03:20.927
Allen!

03:26.432 --> 03:28.100
Oh, my God!

03:55.628 --> 03:57.338
Thanks a lot. Thanks.

03:57.547 --> 04:01.592
You okay, Allen? Lend me a towel.
A towel. Thanks.

04:01.717 --> 04:03.427
Why did you do that?

04:17.692 --> 04:18.860
Come on, son.

04:38.796 --> 04:42.300
<i>Augie, pick up line four, please.</i>

04:49.348 --> 04:50.391
Where are my cherries?

04:50.474 --> 04:52.018
Mr. McCullough, they came in,

04:52.101 --> 04:54.270
but there was a fog upstate
and the highway...

04:54.353 --> 04:55.646
Where are my cherries?

04:55.855 --> 04:57.315
If I don't have my cherries
in five minutes,

04:57.398 --> 04:59.942
you don't get your money
and you starve and you die.

05:00.610 --> 05:02.028
Jerry?

05:04.238 --> 05:06.324
Jerry, where the hell
are McCullough's cherries?

05:06.407 --> 05:09.076
They're here, but you gotta take a look
at this stuff.

05:09.702 --> 05:12.747
Ah, Mr. McCullough, be right back.

05:13.497 --> 05:15.207
Where are my cherries?

05:17.209 --> 05:19.837
Augie, where the hell did you grow
these things? Under your arms?

05:19.921 --> 05:22.381
Jesus, snails with stems.
Forget it. Get them outta here!

05:22.465 --> 05:24.717
- George, get them out of here.
-You got it.

05:26.510 --> 05:29.722
Bauer. Thank you. Honey, what's up?

05:29.805 --> 05:32.850
We get a lot of rain
and the cherries get a little slime.

05:33.184 --> 05:35.937
- I can't hear you.
-You agreed to take these off our hands.

05:36.020 --> 05:39.065
- When the hell did I agree to that?
-Not you, your brother.

05:40.107 --> 05:41.692
Ah, all right.

05:41.776 --> 05:43.653
Victoria, I can't hear you.

05:43.778 --> 05:46.155
What I'm doing is important, too.
I'll call you right back.

05:46.656 --> 05:48.449
My brother bought your slimy cherries?

05:48.574 --> 05:50.785
Yeah. Me and Freddie.
We were playing poker.

05:50.868 --> 05:52.787
He had two pair. I had a flush.

05:52.870 --> 05:55.998
He had no cash, so we worked this out.

06:04.590 --> 06:06.801
Who put this goddamn fruit here?

06:08.010 --> 06:09.553
I'm all right, if anyone's concerned.

06:10.096 --> 06:11.097
Good morning, Freddie.

06:12.682 --> 06:13.933
Allen! Allen!

06:14.016 --> 06:16.060
- I want a simple "yes" or "no."
-One more second, Mr. McCullough.

06:16.477 --> 06:20.398
I made it. I'm in Penthouse magazine.
They printed my letter!

06:21.524 --> 06:23.234
- They printed my letter.
-Listen, I'm very happy.

06:23.317 --> 06:25.027
I'm in the Forum section.

06:25.945 --> 06:27.947
The story's entitled
<i>A</i> Lesbian No More.

06:28.114 --> 06:30.324
They printed every word I wrote.
It's a beautiful story.

06:30.449 --> 06:31.867
Here. I want copies for everybody.

06:31.951 --> 06:34.745
Augie, good to see you!

06:35.037 --> 06:36.539
Great game. We gotta do that more.

06:36.622 --> 06:38.874
- Freddie, can we talk?
-Great poker player.

06:39.125 --> 06:42.211
- Cheats like a son of a bitch!
-Freddie, you and I have to talk.

06:42.294 --> 06:44.505
Missing petty cash?
It was the cleaning girl.

06:44.588 --> 06:45.840
I don't care about that.

06:45.923 --> 06:47.008
- You don't?
-No.

06:47.091 --> 06:48.342
Then it was me. I admit the whole thing.

06:48.467 --> 06:50.469
Well, I still don't care about it, Freddie.

06:50.553 --> 06:53.222
I love this guy! Do you hear me?
I love him.

06:53.305 --> 06:54.807
- Gimme a kiss.
-Oh, Freddie.

06:54.890 --> 06:55.891
Give your older brother a kiss.

06:55.975 --> 06:57.935
What's the matter? You're too big to...

07:01.939 --> 07:03.399
I love this guy's head.

07:03.482 --> 07:06.027
Curly, here's a buck. Wash my car.

07:06.986 --> 07:09.613
Bauer! Where are my...

07:09.697 --> 07:11.532
McCullough, your cherries, yes.

07:11.615 --> 07:12.658
Believe me when I tell you this.

07:12.742 --> 07:14.827
You're not gonna be satisfied
with what we have for you.

07:14.994 --> 07:18.247
Okay, Bauer. You're ruined!
Everyone's gonna know you left me dry.

07:18.330 --> 07:20.374
You're finished,
you're a ghost in this business.

07:20.666 --> 07:23.586
- How'd you like bananas at cost?
-Deal!

07:23.669 --> 07:26.422
Jerry, set up our friend,
Mr. McCullough, bananas at cost.

07:26.505 --> 07:29.550
Allen, wait. I've got to get out early.

07:29.633 --> 07:32.053
Gee, right. Today's the big day.

07:32.136 --> 07:34.430
Don't forget.
Ushers have to be early, too.

07:34.847 --> 07:36.682
-I'll be there.
-Okay.

07:38.517 --> 07:42.396
<i>Will someone
get those Jonathans off the truck?</i>

07:44.190 --> 07:46.192
Any messages, Mrs. Stimler?

07:46.859 --> 07:48.235
Yes.

07:52.823 --> 07:53.866
What are they?

07:54.784 --> 07:56.577
Huh? Oh...

07:58.120 --> 08:01.207
Your father called.
He wants you to call him back.

08:02.166 --> 08:06.128
Mrs. Stimler,
our father passed away five years ago.

08:06.295 --> 08:07.338
Remember?

08:07.963 --> 08:09.215
Right.

08:10.549 --> 08:12.093
Should I get him for you?

08:12.968 --> 08:15.805
No, no. We'll... I'll take care of it.

08:15.888 --> 08:17.765
You just get back to work.

08:26.065 --> 08:27.441
What's with her?

08:27.525 --> 08:29.068
A little accident over the weekend.

08:29.151 --> 08:31.153
Got hit in the head by some lightning.

08:33.072 --> 08:35.573
It's not funny, Freddie! It's not funny.

08:36.033 --> 08:38.577
I'm sorry. That's not funny.
That's not funny.

08:38.828 --> 08:42.164
Besides, she can still do certain things
around the office.

08:42.414 --> 08:44.082
Like jump-start a car?

08:46.710 --> 08:48.587
Jump-start a car!

08:48.671 --> 08:50.131
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

08:50.548 --> 08:52.133
What the hell are you doing down here?

08:52.466 --> 08:55.010
Maybe I went to the "Club A" last night.

08:55.136 --> 08:56.428
Something new for you.

08:57.054 --> 08:59.849
Maybe I met Mr. Buyrite,
owner of Buyrite Supermarkets.

09:00.933 --> 09:02.434
Maybe we had a few drinks.

09:03.644 --> 09:07.606
And maybe, just maybe,
we're his new produce suppliers.

09:08.607 --> 09:11.861
I'm proud of you.
That's great! Which store?

09:12.153 --> 09:15.114
Not which store, the whole chain.

09:16.782 --> 09:18.909
I hope you are joking with me right now.

09:18.993 --> 09:20.452
Think big, be big, my friend.

09:20.870 --> 09:21.954
He was a green beret colonel.

09:22.037 --> 09:23.789
I made up a story about you
being wounded in Nam

09:23.873 --> 09:25.124
and he wants to do business.

09:25.332 --> 09:27.376
Now he's coming this morning
to check out the operation.

09:27.459 --> 09:30.796
This morning? Great, Freddie.
It's only chaos down here.

09:30.880 --> 09:32.715
Augie brings me slimy cherries
from upstate.

09:32.798 --> 09:34.383
So what? So what?

09:34.466 --> 09:35.968
Jerry's getting married tomorrow.

09:36.051 --> 09:37.636
- So what?
-Did you realize that?

09:37.720 --> 09:39.722
I was out drinking with this burn
all night long.

09:39.805 --> 09:41.307
- I have to pick up my tuxedo.
-l'm busting my buns.

09:41.390 --> 09:43.058
All the way up on East 77th Street.

09:43.142 --> 09:45.519
Come on, you can handle this deal.
Come on, relax.

09:45.603 --> 09:46.854
Yeah, I'll handle it fine.

09:46.937 --> 09:49.773
Your desk looks like a pigsty.
Do what I do...

09:49.857 --> 09:51.400
I have a system on the desk.

09:51.483 --> 09:52.902
--Phone for you.

09:52.985 --> 09:56.822
Yes? All right. Thank you.

09:56.906 --> 09:58.991
Hi, Victoria. I'm sorry.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.160
I meant to call you back. I forgot.

10:01.619 --> 10:03.412
What's the matter?
Your voice sounds funny.

10:04.538 --> 10:06.290
What? Now?

10:08.000 --> 10:09.710
You're moving out
of the apartment now?

10:09.793 --> 10:11.503
While we're talking on the phone.

10:13.255 --> 10:15.966
Yeah, I know we were
going to talk about it.

10:16.759 --> 10:20.387
Victoria, this is a little impulsive,
don't you think?

10:21.138 --> 10:23.182
If we were married,
you wouldn't just move out like this.

10:23.557 --> 10:25.684
- She might do that. Sure.
-Will you get off!

10:26.435 --> 10:27.853
- Was that you?
-Get off the phone!

10:27.937 --> 10:30.439
-I'm so sorry!
-No, no, no. Not you, Victoria.

10:30.522 --> 10:33.234
I didn't know you were on the phone.

10:35.277 --> 10:36.946
What do you mean, do I love you?

10:39.156 --> 10:40.866
Well, I...

10:42.368 --> 10:45.579
Well, we met and...

10:47.206 --> 10:49.208
You moved in, didn't you?

10:51.627 --> 10:55.756
Well, it's just a very complicated thing.

10:56.048 --> 10:58.384
Hey, do you love me?

10:58.884 --> 11:00.886
Well, there you go.

11:06.517 --> 11:07.977
There she went.

11:11.188 --> 11:13.065
What a huge wedding.

11:18.362 --> 11:20.239
Cindy, hi.

11:21.865 --> 11:24.076
- How are you?
-How are you?

11:25.327 --> 11:26.954
Excuse me.

11:27.121 --> 11:28.622
You look so pretty!

11:31.917 --> 11:36.005
Darn! My flash never works!

11:36.338 --> 11:39.133
Figures.
My mother-in-law gave it to me.

11:41.260 --> 11:42.428
Get up!

11:42.678 --> 11:44.930
What? What?

11:45.431 --> 11:47.516
It was embarrassing
when you were 10, Freddie.

11:47.599 --> 11:50.227
Look, if something works for me,
I stick with it!

11:50.602 --> 11:52.062
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

11:52.438 --> 11:54.690
I got to get more involved with business,
and I intend to.

11:55.024 --> 11:58.360
I mean that this time. I'm going to.
I know the business.

11:58.444 --> 12:00.404
I was there at the beginning with Dad,
remember?

12:01.822 --> 12:05.367
I just wanna know if we sell
fruit and vegetables, or is it just fruit?

12:06.660 --> 12:09.455
By the time I came home,
she was already gone.

12:09.538 --> 12:10.956
- Victoria left, huh?
-Yeah.

12:11.915 --> 12:13.667
You know why she left me, Freddie?

12:14.793 --> 12:15.961
Because I didn't love her.

12:16.045 --> 12:17.379
That bitch.

12:19.465 --> 12:22.217
Hi. Anywhere but the first three rows.

12:23.302 --> 12:25.429
- Anywhere but the first three rows.
-Hey!

12:25.512 --> 12:28.349
Hi, Freddie.
Hey, Allen, where's Victoria?

12:28.766 --> 12:31.310
She's sick, and she can't make it.

12:31.435 --> 12:33.228
That's too bad. I'm sorry.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.567
Why I didn't love her, Freddie?
Can you answer me that?

12:38.650 --> 12:40.778
Why I didn't love her?
I mean, she had everything.

12:40.861 --> 12:44.782
She was bright, she was sensitive,
she was beautiful.

12:44.865 --> 12:47.201
- Hey, Allen!
-Hi.

12:47.284 --> 12:48.369
Where's Victoria?

12:48.452 --> 12:50.621
Flu. Bad flu. She's very sick.

12:50.704 --> 12:52.456
And she can't make it
because of the flu.

12:52.581 --> 12:54.833
- Give her my love.
-You bet! Sure.

12:55.959 --> 12:58.212
I can't even give her my love, Freddie.

12:58.379 --> 13:02.049
I'm telling you.
Something in here is networking.

13:02.132 --> 13:04.385
There are worse organs
not to be working. Ha!

13:04.510 --> 13:08.055
Hi, guys. Bauer,
where's that pretty lady of yours?

13:08.138 --> 13:09.765
She's not coming! Okay?

13:09.848 --> 13:11.558
What? Do you want your money back?

13:14.103 --> 13:17.731
Well, I don't know.
Maybe it's all for the best.

13:18.023 --> 13:19.441
- Hey, Allen.
-She left me!

13:19.525 --> 13:21.777
She moved out.
My life's a shambles, okay?

13:21.860 --> 13:23.404
That's the news. You want the weather?

13:23.487 --> 13:25.406
Anywhere but the first three rows!

13:27.533 --> 13:30.202
You should really lighten up on the guy.
That's the bride's brother.

13:32.287 --> 13:35.457
You see, drinking is really a matter
of algebraic ratios.

13:36.917 --> 13:39.962
How drunk you get depends on
how much alcohol you consume

13:40.045 --> 13:41.964
in relation to your total body weight.

13:42.047 --> 13:44.883
You see my point?
It's not that you had a lot to drink,

13:45.008 --> 13:46.135
it's just that you're too skinny.

13:48.137 --> 13:50.389
- Marceau, more drinks here, please.
-No.

13:50.472 --> 13:52.766
Freddie, I don't want to get drunk.

13:52.891 --> 13:54.476
But you are drunk.

13:54.560 --> 13:56.895
You see, a sober person
would have reached for the pretzels.

13:58.272 --> 14:00.023
- Is he going to be there long?
-I don't know.

14:00.107 --> 14:02.734
- Oh, I'm on the bar.
-You're on the bar.

14:03.152 --> 14:04.862
Come on, off the bar.

14:05.821 --> 14:08.073
This stool is in your way.
Let me move that for you.

14:08.699 --> 14:10.659
Oh, oh, you fell.

14:12.411 --> 14:15.038
That hurt.
You're not having a good day, are you?

14:15.122 --> 14:17.207
Wasn't that a beautiful
wedding ceremony?

14:17.291 --> 14:18.333
That was a beautiful ceremony.

14:18.417 --> 14:21.420
It was. It really was.

14:21.503 --> 14:23.881
- The most gorgeous ceremony...
-A lovely...

14:28.886 --> 14:30.345
- How are you doing?
-Fine.

14:30.429 --> 14:31.763
The fabulous Freddie Bauer here.

14:32.556 --> 14:33.849
Where did you get those?

14:33.932 --> 14:35.851
My grandmother. She left them to me.

14:35.934 --> 14:38.312
She did? They're beautiful.

14:38.395 --> 14:39.771
Thank you.

14:40.939 --> 14:42.191
Hi.

14:42.774 --> 14:43.775
- Hi.
-Hi.

14:43.859 --> 14:45.944
You guys are in love, aren't you?

14:46.612 --> 14:47.863
We just met.

14:48.697 --> 14:52.034
That doesn't matter.
I know about these things.

14:52.159 --> 14:54.119
I can see. I can tell.

14:54.411 --> 14:58.999
You two guys, you're in love.
And I think that's beautiful.

14:59.958 --> 15:01.293
Thanks.

15:05.214 --> 15:06.882
Listen. I don't live too far from here.

15:06.965 --> 15:10.052
Why don't we just go to my place
for a quiet drink?

15:11.470 --> 15:13.972
Do I expect too much out of life?

15:14.556 --> 15:17.184
My dress! I can't believe this.

15:17.643 --> 15:19.853
- I'm sorry.
-Hey, what are you doing?

15:20.896 --> 15:23.398
Both of you. You're both crazy!

15:23.649 --> 15:24.983
I'm sorry. Look...

15:26.068 --> 15:27.819
I don't ask that much, do I?

15:27.986 --> 15:30.072
I don't ask to be famous,
I don't ask to be rich,

15:30.155 --> 15:33.867
I don't ask to play center field
for the New York Yankees or anything.

15:34.117 --> 15:36.203
I just want to meet a woman.
I wanna meet a woman.

15:36.328 --> 15:39.081
And I wanna fall in love,
and I wanna get married.

15:39.164 --> 15:40.165
And I want to have a kid,

15:40.249 --> 15:43.168
and I want to go see him play a tooth
in the school play.

15:45.003 --> 15:46.421
It's not much.

15:47.089 --> 15:49.341
But I'm kidding myself.

15:49.424 --> 15:50.842
It's never going to happen.

15:52.219 --> 15:54.471
I'm going to grow old,

15:54.721 --> 15:57.182
and grow lonely, and I'm gonna die,

15:58.225 --> 16:00.519
and I'll be surrounded
by a bunch of rotten fruit.

16:03.772 --> 16:05.357
- Freddie?
-No kidding!

16:07.317 --> 16:08.318
Freddie?

16:09.861 --> 16:12.781
Allen! I want you to meet
some friends of mine.

16:12.864 --> 16:14.783
This is Tawny, and this is Jill.

16:14.866 --> 16:17.327
-I'm Tawny.
-You're Tawny, Tawny Tiger!

16:17.452 --> 16:19.288
And this is Jill, a four-letter word.

16:19.371 --> 16:21.456
- This is my brother, Allen.
-Hi.

16:21.957 --> 16:24.459
- Freddie, can I talk to you?
-Absolutely.

16:24.543 --> 16:26.169
- Excuse me.
-Sure.

16:26.545 --> 16:28.422
I'll be right back.
We'll whisper some more.

16:28.505 --> 16:30.340
I've got some whispering for you!

16:31.383 --> 16:33.552
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

16:34.052 --> 16:36.305
Pack your bags.
Tonight, my man, we're going to Rio!

16:36.597 --> 16:38.640
These girls have got
a time-sharing condominium.

16:38.724 --> 16:40.100
We're gonna share some time
with them.

16:40.225 --> 16:43.645
No, Freddie, I'm going to Cape Cod.

16:43.937 --> 16:46.148
What are you talking about?
Cape Cod?

16:46.231 --> 16:47.858
Why would you go to Cape Cod?

16:47.941 --> 16:50.569
I don't know.
Because I like Cape Cod, Freddie.

16:50.736 --> 16:51.945
I feel better up there.

16:52.070 --> 16:55.157
I look at the water
and I feel closer to something.

16:55.240 --> 16:58.827
- Cape Cod over Rio? Are you all right?
-Yeah.

16:58.910 --> 17:01.747
- Let me drive you up there.
-No, no.

17:02.456 --> 17:04.040
- You got enough money?
-I've got plenty.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.084
- Yeah?
-Thanks.

17:07.419 --> 17:08.753
Can I have some then?

17:19.013 --> 17:21.724
- Where to?
-Cape Cod, Massachusetts.

17:24.519 --> 17:26.438
You break that, you pay for it.

17:27.105 --> 17:31.860
Well, I'm sorry. I usually enjoy
smashing the glass with my face.

17:32.277 --> 17:35.906
Okay. Cape Cod. That's about
300 miles. You got the cash?

17:36.448 --> 17:37.908
What is this?

17:59.721 --> 18:01.223
Careful With that.

18:02.182 --> 18:03.642
Be careful with that!

18:03.725 --> 18:07.396
What do you think you're loading?
This is delicate scientific equipment.

18:10.482 --> 18:14.569
Hold it. Put it down. You see that?
It says, "This end up."

18:14.653 --> 18:17.197
Know what that means? This end up!

18:17.280 --> 18:19.449
Why don't you try holding that end up?

18:22.202 --> 18:23.286
All right, get away!

18:23.370 --> 18:26.164
I'll do it myself. Get away.
Give me a hand.

18:31.670 --> 18:32.921
Easy.

18:34.589 --> 18:36.174
- Move that...
-Excuse me.

18:38.218 --> 18:40.679
- Morning.
-Morning.

18:41.513 --> 18:46.143
Ah, I was dropped off on
the wrong side of the beach.

18:46.518 --> 18:48.729
Could you take me over to the island?

18:50.188 --> 18:52.190
Well, ah, we're not...

18:52.399 --> 18:54.192
We're not going...

18:54.276 --> 18:57.446
We're taking the boat.
We're not going out there!

18:58.947 --> 19:00.866
Have you seen anyone else
along this beach?

19:00.949 --> 19:03.744
No, just me and the moron twins.

19:04.411 --> 19:05.829
We're not twins.

19:09.458 --> 19:11.334
- What is all this stuff?
-I knew it!

19:12.419 --> 19:15.464
Who sent you up here?
Dr. Ross from Chicago?

19:15.964 --> 19:17.924
Who's Dr. Ross from Chicago?

19:18.091 --> 19:21.344
Who's Dr. Ross? You're very good.

19:21.470 --> 19:23.722
I suppose you're some
harmless beachcomber

19:23.805 --> 19:25.974
who happens to wear a tuxedo!

19:26.516 --> 19:29.186
How dare you try and horn in
on someone else's research!

19:29.644 --> 19:30.771
I'm just a guy..-

19:30.854 --> 19:33.607
Walter Kornbluth is not
to be taken advantage of.

19:34.733 --> 19:37.110
Just stay out of my way, sonny.

19:39.905 --> 19:41.865
All right, let's move out!

19:48.163 --> 19:51.333
A guy down the beach
runs people out to the island.

19:51.708 --> 19:52.959
What's the name?

19:54.252 --> 19:55.796
The guy or the island?

19:57.923 --> 19:59.424
I'll find him.

20:02.344 --> 20:05.263
What's the matter? You look nervous.

20:05.639 --> 20:10.393
Yeah. The truth is, Fat Jack,
I don't know how to swim.

20:11.228 --> 20:13.230
- You can't swim?
-No, sir.

20:13.647 --> 20:16.274
Then you wouldn't want me to do this.

20:16.942 --> 20:18.902
Stop! Ah, don't!

20:18.985 --> 20:22.823
Please, cut it out!
There's water coming in the boat!

20:22.948 --> 20:25.200
I'm just having a little fun.

20:25.283 --> 20:26.743
Well, don't.

20:29.496 --> 20:31.623
What is that? What's the matter?

20:32.290 --> 20:35.126
When I rocked the boat,
I must have got water in the engine.

20:35.293 --> 20:38.129
I can fix it. I'm mechanical.

20:44.970 --> 20:46.555
Did you fix it?

20:46.763 --> 20:49.808
No. I'll go back for the other boat.

20:49.891 --> 20:50.976
What?

20:54.187 --> 20:56.606
Where are you going, Mr. Fat Jack?

20:57.649 --> 20:59.776
Back to the dock. It's only a few miles.

20:59.901 --> 21:03.029
I can swim it.
I'll be back with the little boat.

21:04.406 --> 21:06.116
The little boat?

21:17.919 --> 21:21.882
I knew it.
I knew that guy was spying on me.

21:22.674 --> 21:24.259
I want to go down!

21:27.679 --> 21:29.180
Mr. Corn beef?

21:30.181 --> 21:31.558
Kornbluth!

21:32.559 --> 21:34.477
Whatcha looking for down there?

21:34.686 --> 21:36.187
Buried treasure?

21:37.022 --> 21:38.857
Want to know what I'm looking for?

21:39.107 --> 21:40.358
I'll tell you.

21:42.152 --> 21:45.071
None of your goddamn business,
that's what!

21:45.155 --> 21:46.573
Get out of my way!

21:53.038 --> 21:55.123
Let's pee down his air hose.

21:56.917 --> 21:58.043
You get that.

22:15.727 --> 22:17.562
Piece of shit.

22:31.034 --> 22:32.869
Ahh!

22:45.048 --> 22:46.424
Ah, gee.

23:17.497 --> 23:19.207
Ohhh!

23:22.377 --> 23:23.962
Ohh.

23:31.344 --> 23:32.971
Ouch!

23:34.014 --> 23:35.557
Ouch.

23:57.370 --> 23:58.496
Hello.

23:59.164 --> 24:02.250
You have any idea how I got here?

24:02.584 --> 24:04.169
Did you save me?

24:10.508 --> 24:13.344
Ah, do you speak English?

24:53.051 --> 24:54.761
Hey! Come back!

24:54.969 --> 24:56.971
Hey, come back! Please.

24:57.138 --> 24:59.516
Just tell me who you are.

24:59.849 --> 25:03.269
I've gotta talk to you.
Can I call you? What's your number?

25:03.394 --> 25:05.063
I don't know how to swim.

25:06.147 --> 25:09.025
I don't know how to swim! Come back.

25:10.110 --> 25:12.904
Why didn't I learn how to swim?
Please, just...

26:16.634 --> 26:19.137
It's a mermaid. It's her!

26:19.387 --> 26:24.058
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute! Don't go.

26:25.518 --> 26:26.895
Come back.

26:27.020 --> 26:29.147
I gotta take your picture.

26:31.441 --> 26:32.859
Hold it.

28:17.005 --> 28:18.089
Hi, Mrs. Stimler.

28:18.756 --> 28:21.384
Hi. What happened to your head?

28:21.467 --> 28:24.178
- Lightning?
-No, a boat hit me.

28:26.681 --> 28:28.433
- Mrs. Stimler?
-Yes?

28:29.517 --> 28:32.312
- Nothing.
-So nice to have you back.

28:35.273 --> 28:37.358
Welcome to the Statue of Liberty.

28:37.442 --> 28:39.736
The statue is a gift
from French citizens.

28:39.819 --> 28:43.156
It has come to symbolize hope
for oppressed people.

28:43.781 --> 28:47.660
Over the past century,
she has seen the skyline,

28:47.744 --> 28:52.040
which once she dwarfed,
rise in mountains of stone and steel.

28:52.540 --> 28:56.127
If you'll go inside, the tour will continue.

28:56.336 --> 28:59.964
Come on. Here we go.
Let's go. We're backing up.

29:02.675 --> 29:03.885
You've got feet, use them!

29:03.968 --> 29:08.806
Don't touch my hat.
Do not ever touch my hat. That's it.

29:09.015 --> 29:11.476
UP, UP, up, up, up, up. Okay.

29:12.226 --> 29:13.978
Welcome to the Statue of Liberty.

29:14.437 --> 29:16.689
The statue is a gift
from French citizens.

29:16.773 --> 29:20.109
It has come to symbolize hope
for naked women everywhere.

29:20.818 --> 29:22.445
Bocci balls!

29:22.528 --> 29:24.822
--Hey, hey.

29:25.490 --> 29:27.241
Come on. Don't be doing that.

29:27.992 --> 29:32.163
Take a picture of me, Vinnie.
Vinnie, take my picture.

29:32.246 --> 29:34.540
You get it? You get it!

29:36.918 --> 29:41.005
The statue was a gift
from French people.

29:41.214 --> 29:43.132
Get out of the way. What's going on?

29:43.674 --> 29:48.554
Okay, miss. This ain't California.
We don't go for this.

30:06.739 --> 30:07.782
What's your name?

30:07.865 --> 30:09.409
She don't speak no English.

30:09.492 --> 30:10.451
And you do?

30:10.535 --> 30:12.578
Here. She was carrying this.

30:12.787 --> 30:13.830
What's this?

30:17.208 --> 30:18.459
Who's this guy?

30:21.504 --> 30:23.297
Is that enough?
Do you want some more?

30:23.714 --> 30:26.592
That's all we can handle.
Let's talk terms.

30:26.717 --> 30:28.511
He doesn't have the slightest clue
what's going on.

30:28.594 --> 30:31.222
Don't worry.
We'll move it out in the morning.

30:31.347 --> 30:35.393
Bauer. Your brother told me about
your unfortunate experience in Vietnam.

30:37.270 --> 30:38.438
Huh?

30:39.105 --> 30:41.649
The incident in Vietnam. Remember?

30:43.776 --> 30:47.238
The grenade still bother you?
You're wearing a bandage.

30:47.780 --> 30:49.699
Page him. Hey, Al?

30:49.991 --> 30:51.075
- Yeah?
-Phone.

30:51.826 --> 30:53.911
Um, excuse me.

30:55.913 --> 30:57.623
Thanks, Jerry. Yeah?

30:57.957 --> 31:00.293
Allen Bauer. Speaking.

31:07.091 --> 31:08.301
Yeah. On my way!

31:08.468 --> 31:09.927
I believe this...

31:12.096 --> 31:14.640
Allen, where are you going?

31:15.266 --> 31:16.267
Allen!

31:18.603 --> 31:20.605
- What happened?
-Telephone.

31:20.980 --> 31:23.649
He was on the phone in Nam
when the grenade went off.

31:23.941 --> 31:29.030
Ever since then, he runs,
gets in a car, and drives away.

31:29.572 --> 31:33.117
- Oh.
-I don't know why. It just happens.

31:33.326 --> 31:35.953
- Oh.
-Let's review this.

31:58.518 --> 32:00.186
Pardon me. Excuse me!

32:00.311 --> 32:02.897
--Mr. Police Officer?

32:02.980 --> 32:04.982
Hey! Take it easy.

32:05.107 --> 32:06.400
What do you want?

32:07.235 --> 32:09.362
My name's Allen Bauer.
You guys called me.

32:10.571 --> 32:12.907
Any of you guys call for an Allen Bauer?

32:13.366 --> 32:16.327
Bauer. Yeah. That's for her.

32:17.495 --> 32:18.746
Right over there.

32:41.352 --> 32:42.562
Hi.

32:51.070 --> 32:52.613
I take it you know this girl?

32:54.490 --> 32:55.616
Yeah, I do.

32:56.993 --> 32:58.119
Who is she?

33:00.454 --> 33:01.706
I don't know.

33:02.081 --> 33:03.207
Of course.

33:16.721 --> 33:19.390
Afternoon. You're home early.

33:19.765 --> 33:20.933
Yeah.

33:28.232 --> 33:32.528
Uh, that doorway spins.

33:32.612 --> 33:34.155
Want to get this fixed, Timmy?

33:41.245 --> 33:42.622
- Hi.
-Hello.

34:47.311 --> 34:49.980
Room service.
I didn't know what you liked,

34:50.106 --> 34:53.484
so I got you a choice.
Fruity Pebbles, pancakes...

34:53.734 --> 34:55.902
No. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

34:56.195 --> 34:59.949
I've got to get back to work.
That will keep you company.

35:00.449 --> 35:03.953
When I come back from work,
we'll get some dinner,

35:04.120 --> 35:05.996
and pick you up some clothes.

35:06.497 --> 35:09.250
Not that you don't look
spectacular in my robe.

35:10.501 --> 35:12.253
Okay? Bye-bye.

35:15.423 --> 35:17.425
No. Please.

35:17.508 --> 35:19.051
You're gonna put me in the hospital.

35:19.552 --> 35:22.471
It's about 3:00. I really have to get back.

35:23.514 --> 35:25.224
You are wonderful.

35:25.683 --> 35:27.810
BYE-bye. Bye.

35:33.357 --> 35:36.694
Things don't get started again
until 4:00.

35:42.575 --> 35:44.910
Let's not be so choosy
with these onions.

35:45.369 --> 35:47.621
Some of these
are perfectly good onions.

35:48.706 --> 35:50.833
Everybody, zip-a-dee-doo-dah!

35:51.417 --> 35:54.420

36:09.477 --> 36:11.103
Please, not in front of the teamsters.

36:11.187 --> 36:12.688
Come on, they're happy guys.

36:12.772 --> 36:14.231
You're a rotten lead.

36:14.732 --> 36:16.901
I've got the Buyrite contracts ready.

36:17.359 --> 36:18.986
- Want to check them?
-No.

36:19.069 --> 36:20.988
You check them.
You know the business.

36:21.197 --> 36:22.907
- So I'm in charge?
-Sure.

36:23.199 --> 36:24.950
What about the lawyer's meeting
at 8:00?

36:25.159 --> 36:28.412
8:00 p.m.? That's too late for me.

36:29.121 --> 36:31.832
I'm going upstairs and take a nap.

36:32.291 --> 36:34.126
Wake me when it's time to go home.

36:34.835 --> 36:35.836

37:13.791 --> 37:15.167
Can I help you?

37:17.378 --> 37:18.587
Can't you talk?

37:21.173 --> 37:24.260
- Bloomingdale's?
-Sure. Hey!

38:21.817 --> 38:23.485
Oh, my God.

38:24.361 --> 38:26.864
Darling. Darling.

38:27.031 --> 38:30.951
Darling! That outfit, it's to die from.

38:31.035 --> 38:33.704
What happened?
You saw <i>Annie</i> Hall 100 times?

38:33.871 --> 38:35.706
That look is over.

38:36.957 --> 38:38.542
You want to try that on?

38:38.626 --> 38:40.210
Who knows? Maybe it's you.

38:40.669 --> 38:42.838
I couldn't get one leg in there.

38:43.339 --> 38:47.176
My daughter is lucky. She's anorexic.

38:50.888 --> 38:53.974
Please call again. Don't forget these.

38:55.726 --> 38:58.896
Do yourself a favor
and stop in the lingerie department.

38:59.605 --> 39:02.900
A pretty girl like you
shouldn't wear boxer shorts.

Hello?

40:09.008 --> 40:10.467
I'm home!

40:28.193 --> 40:30.362
-I'm looking for a girl, Timmy.
-200 bucks.

40:30.487 --> 40:33.073
No, the blonde I came in with.

40:33.365 --> 40:35.909
- Oh, she left.
-Any idea where?

40:36.035 --> 40:39.163
- I put her in a cab.
-To where, Timmy?

40:39.371 --> 40:41.623
- Bloomingdale's.
-Bloomingdale's. Great. Thanks.

40:41.749 --> 40:44.626
Yo! Hey, taxi! Hey!

40:45.377 --> 40:46.837
Halt, taxi, please!

40:47.254 --> 40:49.256
<i>She works hard for the money</i>

40:49.339 --> 40:52.509
<i>Come on, come on. Let's go!</i>

40:52.801 --> 40:56.513
<i>She works hard for the money
so you better treat her right</i>

40:57.514 --> 41:00.100
Excuse me, miss,
we're getting ready to close.

41:00.184 --> 41:02.519
She's been here for six hours.

41:06.023 --> 41:07.066
Excuse me, miss.

41:07.149 --> 41:12.571
I'm going to insist
that you stop doing that.

41:16.200 --> 41:18.869
She's exercising.

41:20.788 --> 41:23.040
Give her a minute.

41:24.875 --> 41:26.668
Sir, we're closing.

41:26.752 --> 41:27.836
I know. Just give me three minutes.

41:27.920 --> 41:30.714
- Come back.
-Three minutes. You can time me!

41:33.550 --> 41:35.469
Oh, thank God.

41:36.095 --> 41:38.222
Excuse me. Do you know this woman?

41:38.388 --> 41:41.141
Yeah. Just don't ask me her name.

41:41.683 --> 41:43.685
We've been trying to tell her
it's closing time,

41:43.769 --> 41:45.896
but she doesn't seem to understand.

41:46.563 --> 41:48.774
That's because
she doesn't speak English.

41:48.899 --> 41:51.819
Hello, Allen. How was your day?

41:53.904 --> 41:58.242
I never went to college,
but wasn't that English?

41:58.659 --> 42:00.828
Thank you for letting me
use your television.

42:00.911 --> 42:03.455
It was very educational.

42:04.915 --> 42:06.333
It's all right, miss.

42:09.753 --> 42:11.421
What's your name?

42:11.755 --> 42:14.133
It's hard to say in English.

42:14.466 --> 42:16.885
Well, just say it in your language.

42:17.761 --> 42:20.264
All right. My name is...

42:35.320 --> 42:37.281
Hey, how 'bout those Knicks?

42:38.615 --> 42:42.619
I'm confused why you haven't
said anything until now.

42:42.786 --> 42:43.954
I didn't know English.

42:44.329 --> 42:45.998
I see. Now you do?

42:46.081 --> 42:48.750
I learned from television. It's wonderful!

42:48.834 --> 42:51.420
I'll ask questions
and if you answer correctly,

42:51.503 --> 42:53.380
you can win one of these prizes.

42:53.630 --> 42:55.841
A wall clock,
matching washer and dryer,

42:55.924 --> 42:58.135
or a brand-new car!

42:58.343 --> 43:00.053
Let me go first, okay?

43:00.345 --> 43:02.472
Who are you? Where are you from?

43:02.764 --> 43:06.935
Begin when you were born
and finish when you blew up the TVs.

43:14.818 --> 43:16.153
Pretty.

43:17.654 --> 43:21.658
Well, yeah.
I've never thought about it before.

43:22.784 --> 43:24.119
Are you from Cape Cod?

43:26.580 --> 43:29.333
No, I'm from another place.

43:30.209 --> 43:32.711
Yeah? I've got a cousin from there.
Ha-ha-ha.

43:36.632 --> 43:38.050
Are you an American?

43:38.717 --> 43:39.968
No.

43:40.677 --> 43:44.514
Then why were you in
Cape Cod and now New York?

43:44.681 --> 43:46.850
How did the cops find you naked?

43:47.059 --> 43:48.352
What's that?

43:49.144 --> 43:50.520
What? The music?

43:50.896 --> 43:53.690
I like music!
I heard some in the television,

43:53.774 --> 43:55.108
<i>Dance Fever.</i>

43:55.359 --> 43:58.820
<i>Hey, I love you, girl</i>

43:59.196 --> 44:00.656
<i>Darling</i>

44:00.739 --> 44:02.741
Ah, hi, hi.

44:02.824 --> 44:05.077
We better go, hon, or else we'll be late.

44:05.577 --> 44:06.995
You never heard music?

44:07.162 --> 44:08.538
What's that?

44:08.664 --> 44:11.375
- Ah...

44:11.625 --> 44:13.460
--Oh, gosh!

44:13.543 --> 44:14.670
What's that?

44:14.753 --> 44:15.796
It's a movie theater.

44:15.879 --> 44:17.839
What the hell you doin'?
You could've got me killed!

44:17.965 --> 44:20.342
Cut her some slack.
She's from out of town.

44:20.467 --> 44:21.718
Keep her on a leash.

44:22.052 --> 44:23.804
Yeah, yeah. Have a nice day.

44:23.887 --> 44:25.138
Hello?

44:29.559 --> 44:30.686
Did you see this?

44:30.852 --> 44:34.064
It's wonderfully delicious
and so good for you.

44:34.898 --> 44:38.235
While you're here, watch a little less TV.

44:40.112 --> 44:43.699
How long are you going to be in town?

44:45.033 --> 44:47.077
Six fun-filled days.

44:47.995 --> 44:49.413
Oh, six days.

44:49.913 --> 44:51.164
Is that all?

44:53.333 --> 44:54.835
Six days,

44:55.460 --> 44:57.087
and the moon is full.

44:58.297 --> 44:59.673
Oh.

45:02.175 --> 45:03.802
The moon is full.

45:10.309 --> 45:13.103
If I stay longer than that,
I can't ever go back.

45:14.146 --> 45:15.605
Oh, I get... What?

45:15.939 --> 45:18.400
Is there some sort of
immigration problem?

45:19.276 --> 45:20.777
Where did you get that?

45:21.236 --> 45:23.196
Where? Oh, for...

45:26.408 --> 45:29.745
Sir? Here you are, sir. There you go.

45:31.121 --> 45:33.373
I'm going to have to call you something
in English,

45:33.457 --> 45:36.209
because I can't pronounce... What?

45:36.293 --> 45:37.961
What are English names?

45:38.628 --> 45:40.672
There's millions of them, I guess.

45:40.922 --> 45:42.883
Jennifer, Joanie, Hillary.

45:42.966 --> 45:44.634
Careful. Those are hot.

45:45.302 --> 45:47.596
Names, names. Linda, Kim...

45:47.679 --> 45:49.973
Where are we? Madison.

45:50.098 --> 45:52.392
- Elizabeth, Samantha...
-I like Madison.

45:52.893 --> 45:54.686
Madison's not a name.

45:56.646 --> 45:59.483
Well, all right. Madison it is.

45:59.691 --> 46:01.818
Good thing we weren't at 149th Street.

46:02.527 --> 46:04.404
Are we going back to where you live?

46:05.739 --> 46:08.325
Okay, um, here's the thing.

46:08.450 --> 46:11.328
I was going to find you a hotel,

46:12.162 --> 46:14.539
but I figure that after this afternoon...

46:15.957 --> 46:18.502
Well, I just assumed that...

46:21.213 --> 46:24.341
Would you mind staying with me?

46:26.468 --> 46:27.928
I want to stay with you.

46:28.595 --> 46:30.555
You're the reason I came here.

46:41.775 --> 46:43.527
Ah, that was a kiss.

46:44.528 --> 46:45.612
I know.

48:57.619 --> 48:58.745
Madison?

49:08.338 --> 49:10.382
- Madison?
-Allen?

49:11.716 --> 49:13.510
Yeah, of course it's Allen.

49:14.010 --> 49:15.262
What are you doing, sweetheart?

49:16.221 --> 49:17.639
Taking a bath.

49:18.348 --> 49:20.934
Ooo, ooo. Can I come in?

49:22.352 --> 49:23.478
No!

49:25.814 --> 49:27.190
What was that?

49:27.357 --> 49:28.900
Madison, are you all right?

49:29.025 --> 49:30.694
Everything's fine.

49:30.902 --> 49:31.903
Then let me in.

49:32.070 --> 49:34.823
I'll be right there. I'm just changing.

49:34.906 --> 49:37.742
Enough! Open the door.
Something is wrong.

49:38.368 --> 49:40.453
Allen, can you make me
some pancakes?

49:40.537 --> 49:42.205
Make you some... Madison!

49:42.914 --> 49:44.583
All right, Madison, this is getting scary.

49:44.666 --> 49:47.002
Either open this door,
or I'll break it down!

49:47.961 --> 49:50.297
- No, Allen, please.
-All right, that's it!

49:50.380 --> 49:52.382
- Allen, no!
-Ow.

50:04.185 --> 50:05.520
Hi.

50:06.396 --> 50:09.524
Hi. Are you okay?

50:10.567 --> 50:11.901
Yeah.

50:12.068 --> 50:13.695
Why wouldn't you let me in?

50:15.488 --> 50:17.782
I was shy.

50:20.118 --> 50:21.536
You were shy?

50:22.120 --> 50:25.165
After the car, elevator, bedroom,

50:25.248 --> 50:27.584
and top of the refrigerator,
you were shy?

50:30.086 --> 50:31.463
I was shy.

50:33.006 --> 50:34.215
She was shy.

51:05.622 --> 51:07.332
Hey, B.B. Brain!

51:08.458 --> 51:11.252
- Yeah?
-See this hose?

51:12.212 --> 51:15.131
- It's so I can breathe.
-Uh-huh.

51:15.632 --> 51:17.926
You want to get your chair off it?

51:18.635 --> 51:19.719
Huh?

51:29.479 --> 51:31.064
<i>The Star Confidential?</i>

51:32.899 --> 51:33.942
Yeah.

51:34.025 --> 51:35.110
Why are you reading that?

51:35.694 --> 51:36.736
I don't know.

51:37.529 --> 51:41.241
What possesses the uneducated
to purchase these?

51:41.825 --> 51:43.076
Interesting.

51:43.159 --> 51:44.994
You're not helping yourself.

51:45.328 --> 51:48.331
You're not... This is not news.

51:48.957 --> 51:51.167
Give me this. You know what's in here?

51:51.459 --> 51:54.838
Nothing. You have sex, perversion.

51:55.130 --> 51:57.215
It's all fabrication. Look at this.

51:57.882 --> 52:00.260
A naked woman at the Statue of Liberty.

52:02.804 --> 52:04.514
Where would they find a girl to do that?

52:10.186 --> 52:12.397
- Ow, my head!
-Let me see that.

52:21.197 --> 52:23.408
Take me back to shore. Now!

52:28.246 --> 52:29.247
Hello.

52:34.461 --> 52:35.962
Madison, what is it?

52:37.005 --> 52:38.214
What happened?

52:40.592 --> 52:42.802
It's the saddest thing I ever saw.

52:45.513 --> 52:46.931
<i>It's Bonanza.</i>

52:48.224 --> 52:51.352
The man killed another man
and he died in the street.

52:52.645 --> 52:55.940
No, no. This is only TV.

52:56.149 --> 52:59.778
I thought you understood
about TV being make-believe.

53:00.028 --> 53:03.072
It's pretend killing that's going on.
See, now.

53:03.239 --> 53:05.033
This guy is an actor.

53:05.116 --> 53:07.368
Next week, he'll get shot
on another show.

53:08.077 --> 53:09.662
When you think about it,
it's kinda funny.

53:12.540 --> 53:14.375
I'm supposed to laugh?

53:15.543 --> 53:17.754
Yeah. There you go.

53:18.671 --> 53:19.839
Yeah.

53:21.132 --> 53:22.801
I got you something.

53:38.566 --> 53:41.402
It's beautiful. I love it.

53:44.155 --> 53:46.366
No, you open it.

53:47.325 --> 53:48.409
There's more?

55:05.945 --> 55:07.030
Do you like that?

55:07.822 --> 55:09.115
Yeah, I do.

55:10.867 --> 55:12.869
I don't know why. Just...

55:13.953 --> 55:15.455
Something about it.

55:15.747 --> 55:17.248
It's always appealed to me.

55:19.792 --> 55:21.210
Do you like the sea?

55:22.545 --> 55:27.008
No. When I was about eight,
I had this accident on a ship.

55:27.425 --> 55:28.718
I remember.

55:30.178 --> 55:31.387
What?

55:32.388 --> 55:35.600
Ah, I can't. I forget the words.

55:35.725 --> 55:38.102
What's... I understand.

55:41.731 --> 55:43.942
Did you get hurt?

55:45.234 --> 55:47.987
No, no, I didn't,

55:48.655 --> 55:52.909
but when I was underwater,
I could have sworn I saw...

55:54.410 --> 55:55.912
What?

55:57.246 --> 55:58.289
Nothing.

55:58.414 --> 55:59.624
- What?
-Nothing!

56:00.249 --> 56:01.751
I was just a stupid kid.

56:05.964 --> 56:07.840
They're going to tear this park out.

56:08.049 --> 56:09.258
<i>Why'?</i>

56:09.592 --> 56:13.012
They're gonna build river-front condos
or some such nonsense.

56:13.680 --> 56:15.431
What are you gonna do, huh?

56:20.186 --> 56:21.604
You want to go home?

56:22.271 --> 56:24.023
No, I have five days left!

56:24.107 --> 56:26.859
No, no, no. My home!

56:27.443 --> 56:28.486
Oh.

56:29.654 --> 56:31.406
Yes.

56:42.250 --> 56:44.794
Why do we want
to go to a political dinner?

56:44.877 --> 56:46.587
The president will be speaking.

56:46.671 --> 56:48.047
President of what?

56:48.172 --> 56:50.299
President of
the Three Stooges Fan Club.

56:50.633 --> 56:52.385
- The president of the United States!
-Wow.

56:52.885 --> 56:54.887
I tell you. We'll be rubbing elbows
with the big boys.

56:55.221 --> 56:56.514
You think big, you be big.

56:56.597 --> 56:57.640
I guess so.

56:57.932 --> 56:59.308
Listen,

57:00.601 --> 57:04.105
would you mind if I took Madison
to this thing instead of going with you?

57:07.650 --> 57:09.193
What?

57:09.694 --> 57:11.529
- What?
-What?

57:12.321 --> 57:14.449
Something in here networking?

57:14.782 --> 57:18.453
"Oh, I'll never fall in love, Freddie.

57:18.536 --> 57:21.330
"I can't. It won't work with me."

57:21.664 --> 57:24.083
Who said anything
about me being in love?

57:24.167 --> 57:26.169
You haven't been to work in two days.

57:26.627 --> 57:28.087
- So?
-Admit it.

57:29.005 --> 57:30.339
- No.
-Admit it!

57:30.590 --> 57:31.799
Eye gouge!

57:34.510 --> 57:36.095
Ahhh. Ahhh!

57:36.512 --> 57:37.597
- Admit it.
-No.

57:37.680 --> 57:39.015
Bone crusher!

57:46.105 --> 57:47.315
Son of a...

57:56.365 --> 57:57.408
Ow.

58:00.703 --> 58:02.121
How long we been playing?

58:02.205 --> 58:03.414
About five minutes.

58:03.498 --> 58:04.874
Oh, God.

58:05.374 --> 58:07.126
My heart's beating like a rabbit.

58:08.669 --> 58:10.421
You, uh, want a beer?

58:11.255 --> 58:12.715
No, thanks.

58:26.562 --> 58:29.398
So, tell me this.

58:29.899 --> 58:31.484
If you're not in love with her,

58:31.567 --> 58:34.695
how come little things she does
drive you crazy so much?

58:35.238 --> 58:36.531
Little things?

58:36.864 --> 58:41.119
Freddie, the woman learned English
in a single afternoon.

58:43.454 --> 58:45.540
She could probably
speak English already.

58:46.040 --> 58:48.334
I think she was in shock
from being arrested, you know.

58:48.459 --> 58:50.044
Now, what about that, huh?

58:50.545 --> 58:53.256
What about a woman showing up
naked in a public place, Freddie?

58:53.589 --> 58:54.966
I'm for it, of course.

58:56.259 --> 59:00.555
You said that she had
some kind of immigration problem.

59:00.721 --> 59:04.433
She's on an ocean liner
in international waters.

59:04.684 --> 59:08.521
And she sees America. It looks good.

59:08.688 --> 59:12.191
So, she greases her body up
like a channel swimmer.

59:12.358 --> 59:16.612
She dives in.
She has heavy trouble with sharks,

59:16.821 --> 59:21.409
she goes through the Coast Guard,
minefields and then she's on shore.

59:21.492 --> 59:23.077
She's okay. That's it.

59:25.621 --> 59:27.373
What about the bathtub,

59:28.166 --> 59:30.251
this moon stuff, and all those TVs?

59:30.751 --> 59:32.378
Look, I'm being serious.

59:32.712 --> 59:37.550
I admit to a few minor fiascos
in my love life.

59:37.967 --> 59:41.220
Freddie, you took a date
to one of your own weddings!

59:42.471 --> 59:44.682
I'm a free spirit!

59:44.891 --> 59:48.186
I'm extremely liberal,
a freewheeling dude.

59:48.644 --> 59:50.855
You know what your problem is?
You're in love with this girl.

59:50.938 --> 59:52.648
You're trying to convince yourself
you're not.

59:54.775 --> 59:56.652
I just don't know, Freddie.

59:56.819 --> 59:59.238
Something about it isn't right.

01:00:00.198 --> 01:00:01.449
I'll serve.

01:00:01.699 --> 01:00:03.451
Hold the beer.
That will be your handicap.

01:00:03.576 --> 01:00:05.328
- Oh, we're gonna play?
-Yeah.

01:00:06.495 --> 01:00:08.331
I'm gonna teach you
a lesson in humility.

01:00:08.497 --> 01:00:09.582
Wait.

01:00:09.665 --> 01:00:10.958
Humility 101.

01:00:11.918 --> 01:00:13.753
- You all set?
-Yeah.

01:00:13.836 --> 01:00:15.004
Here we go.

01:00:17.006 --> 01:00:18.049
Oh!

01:00:24.513 --> 01:00:27.099
This is what we came to hear?

01:00:30.686 --> 01:00:32.605
You call and tell us

01:00:32.688 --> 01:00:37.401
that you have stretched the frontiers
of paleontology and zoology.

01:00:38.027 --> 01:00:43.491
We interrupt important, serious work
to fly here at a moment's notice,

01:00:43.699 --> 01:00:46.160
and you give us mermaids!

01:00:46.369 --> 01:00:49.205
Don't call us.
Call the comic book companies.

01:00:49.288 --> 01:00:53.125
Enough. We have a seminar
in three weeks. Be ready.

01:00:59.382 --> 01:01:01.634
Allen, you're here! I got you a present.

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:04.887
- Don't look. Close your eyes.
-I gotta close the door.

01:01:05.179 --> 01:01:06.973
What are you doing?

01:01:07.890 --> 01:01:09.225
All right.

01:01:10.768 --> 01:01:12.728
Okay. Look.

01:01:19.694 --> 01:01:22.905
Ha-ha! Wha... You, ah...

01:01:23.281 --> 01:01:25.533
Well, that's big!

01:01:27.368 --> 01:01:29.203
Yeah, this is...

01:01:30.079 --> 01:01:35.167
This is very big, and it's really here.

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.753
It's just so big!

01:01:37.837 --> 01:01:39.880
They were gonna tear it down,
so I bought it for you.

01:01:40.423 --> 01:01:43.092
Where did you get
the money to pay for it?

01:01:45.219 --> 01:01:47.930
Madison, where's your necklace?

01:01:49.056 --> 01:01:50.599
I traded it for the statue.

01:01:50.933 --> 01:01:51.934
<i>Why'?</i>

01:01:53.686 --> 01:01:55.187
Because I love you.

01:01:57.273 --> 01:01:59.692
Oh, Madison.

01:02:03.988 --> 01:02:05.698
Madison, I love...

01:02:06.198 --> 01:02:07.658
This, ah, present.

01:02:08.617 --> 01:02:10.036
I love it.

01:02:13.205 --> 01:02:14.623
And I love you.

01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:22.798
<i>What's happened to you?</i>

01:02:23.215 --> 01:02:25.551
You were the brightest student
in my class.

01:02:26.218 --> 01:02:29.472
True, emotionally,
you were 12 years old.

01:02:29.638 --> 01:02:31.098
I was 12 years old.

01:02:31.182 --> 01:02:32.641
That's right.

01:02:33.309 --> 01:02:34.935
Look what you've become,

01:02:35.561 --> 01:02:36.854
a schmuck.

01:02:38.105 --> 01:02:40.733
There is a mermaid in New York City.

01:02:41.692 --> 01:02:45.237
You mean this naked girl?

01:02:46.322 --> 01:02:47.740
How come she's got legs?

01:02:48.407 --> 01:02:52.244
She has legs out of water
and fins in the water.

01:02:52.370 --> 01:02:55.498
You taught me that, Dr. Zidell.
Remember?

01:02:55.873 --> 01:02:58.209
You taught me all the legends.

01:02:58.876 --> 01:03:00.711
You used to bring me in the office.

01:03:00.795 --> 01:03:02.880
You used to show me charts
on the walls

01:03:02.963 --> 01:03:05.674
where sailors had claimed
they saw mermaids.

01:03:05.841 --> 01:03:11.180
Walter, that was for fun, for relaxation,
not for you to build your whole life on.

01:03:13.265 --> 01:03:16.727
I'm gonna prove to you
and everyone else

01:03:16.894 --> 01:03:19.355
that that girl is a mermaid!

01:03:20.314 --> 01:03:21.690
How?

01:03:21.816 --> 01:03:25.152
You gonna get her wet
so everybody sees she has fins?

01:04:00.813 --> 01:04:02.148
Taxi?

01:04:05.151 --> 01:04:06.360
Oh!

01:04:06.444 --> 01:04:08.487
- Watch it!
-Hey, watch it, buddy.

01:04:08.571 --> 01:04:09.613
Excuse me.

01:04:15.077 --> 01:04:16.454
Look out.

01:04:20.291 --> 01:04:22.209
What does he think he's doing?

01:04:23.586 --> 01:04:25.087
Hey! Hey!

01:04:38.434 --> 01:04:39.935
Oh, my.

01:04:40.978 --> 01:04:44.231
- Ow, ohh, Oof!

01:05:11.509 --> 01:05:12.551
Oops.

01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:15.596
Nice earrings.

01:05:18.516 --> 01:05:21.060
- Is something the matter?
-No, nothing at all.

01:05:21.143 --> 01:05:25.981
I was thinking.
You don't have to leave the country.

01:05:27.816 --> 01:05:29.401
- I do.
-You don't.

01:05:29.485 --> 01:05:33.239
There's stuff we can do
to get around the immigration laws.

01:05:33.322 --> 01:05:37.034
For instance, I could give you a job
down at the market.

01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:39.495
You could get a work visa.

01:05:40.621 --> 01:05:44.375
Or, uh, you could, uh,

01:05:45.167 --> 01:05:47.836
marry, like, an American,

01:05:48.837 --> 01:05:50.297
and they have to let you stay.

01:05:50.881 --> 01:05:52.174
Our food is here!

01:05:53.842 --> 01:05:58.347
Oh. Well, we'll talk about it later.

01:05:59.348 --> 01:06:02.101
Do be careful, madam.
The plate is very hot.

01:06:03.185 --> 01:06:05.104
Thank you. These look terrific.

01:06:27.001 --> 01:06:28.669
She's really hungry!

01:06:54.612 --> 01:06:56.280
You were very good.

01:06:56.572 --> 01:06:59.575
Come on. Oops. Come on.

01:07:01.076 --> 01:07:02.578
Let's sit down and talk.

01:07:04.955 --> 01:07:06.248
Ah.

01:07:08.208 --> 01:07:09.543
Your nose is cold.

01:07:10.419 --> 01:07:12.046
I don't want to talk about my nose.

01:07:12.796 --> 01:07:14.423
Your ears are all red!

01:07:15.090 --> 01:07:17.593
I don't want to talk about
any part of my face.

01:07:19.428 --> 01:07:23.891
But I do want to talk about
what happened in the restaurant.

01:07:25.934 --> 01:07:27.186
I'm sorry.

01:07:27.603 --> 01:07:29.730
That's how we eat lobster
where I come from.

01:07:29.855 --> 01:07:33.692
Oh, no, no, no. I don't care about that.

01:07:34.109 --> 01:07:35.444
No. I don't care about that.

01:07:36.904 --> 01:07:40.366
I was trying to do something in there,
and I guess I did it very badly.

01:07:40.449 --> 01:07:42.159
I was trying

01:07:43.994 --> 01:07:47.039
to ask you if you wanted to get married.

01:07:50.501 --> 01:07:52.127
Madison, will you marry me?

01:07:59.468 --> 01:08:00.803
No.

01:08:01.845 --> 01:08:04.306
What? No? Just no?

01:08:04.556 --> 01:08:07.267
You don't want to think about it,
kick it around?

01:08:07.351 --> 01:08:09.144
- I can't.
-Why?

01:08:10.312 --> 01:08:11.730
I can't tell you.

01:08:11.814 --> 01:08:16.443
I know you have some big secret
you think you can't tell me, but you can.

01:08:16.527 --> 01:08:18.569
- You're already married?
-Allen.

01:08:18.654 --> 01:08:20.488
You're dying? You were once a man?

01:08:20.572 --> 01:08:22.073
Whatever it is, I don't care,
you can tell me.

01:08:22.157 --> 01:08:23.367
Allen.

01:08:23.992 --> 01:08:26.036
I only have three days left.

01:08:28.831 --> 01:08:30.499
Please make them wonderful.

01:08:33.419 --> 01:08:34.670
Okay.

01:08:42.511 --> 01:08:43.845
Want to skate some more?

01:08:46.014 --> 01:08:47.265
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

01:08:51.937 --> 01:08:53.522
Allen?

01:09:11.038 --> 01:09:12.249
You know them?

01:09:12.457 --> 01:09:15.752
No, I've just seen them before.

01:09:15.877 --> 01:09:18.671
I guess they've been coming here
together for about 40 years.

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:23.343
They look very happy.

01:09:24.094 --> 01:09:26.345
Why shouldn't they be happy, huh?

01:09:26.846 --> 01:09:29.349
They get to spend
their whole lives together, don't they?

01:09:33.395 --> 01:09:36.314
Is this really what happens
when water gets cold?

01:09:36.982 --> 01:09:38.233
Yeah.

01:09:39.526 --> 01:09:41.779
Where I come from, it never gets cold.

01:09:42.069 --> 01:09:44.490
Well, hey, what a breakthrough!

01:09:45.032 --> 01:09:47.785
You just really opened up to me there.

01:09:51.788 --> 01:09:53.247
Your voice sounds funny.

01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:55.375
It's called sarcasm.

01:09:55.459 --> 01:09:57.669
They don't have that
where you come from either?

01:10:00.255 --> 01:10:01.507
No.

01:10:04.676 --> 01:10:06.762
Well, they don't have anything,
do they?

01:10:07.304 --> 01:10:11.391
They don't have ice, or music
or clothes.

01:10:11.725 --> 01:10:14.353
What kind of a place is this, Madison?

01:10:15.604 --> 01:10:16.939
Madison?

01:10:17.314 --> 01:10:18.690
Madison!

01:10:18.941 --> 01:10:20.776
Hey, those skates are rented!

01:10:20.943 --> 01:10:24.530
Give me one second. Madison?
Ahh! Madison!

01:10:27.157 --> 01:10:29.868
Madison, please? I'm sorry!

01:10:29.952 --> 01:10:32.746
Let her go.
Show some dignity, for Christ's sake.

01:10:33.163 --> 01:10:34.540
Madison?

01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:44.633
Thanks.

01:12:35.953 --> 01:12:37.746
Hey, Charlie. How's it goin'?

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:45.045
- Allen?
-What?

01:12:54.012 --> 01:12:55.222
Yes.

01:13:10.153 --> 01:13:14.449
If we get our blood test today,
we can marry tomorrow!

01:13:14.616 --> 01:13:16.910
Before the blood test,
I have to tell you everything.

01:13:17.035 --> 01:13:18.370
So, tell me.

01:13:19.579 --> 01:13:21.540
- Not today.
-But see,

01:13:21.623 --> 01:13:24.209
if we get the test today,
no pressure, mind you,

01:13:24.292 --> 01:13:25.794
but if we get the blood test today,

01:13:25.877 --> 01:13:28.046
as soon as you tell me,
we can get married.

01:13:28.630 --> 01:13:30.507
Listen, you will love
being married to me.

01:13:30.632 --> 01:13:31.717
I was born to be married.

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:34.136
I happen to come from a long line
of married people.

01:13:34.219 --> 01:13:36.054
My mom and dad were married.

01:13:36.138 --> 01:13:38.056
Their moms and dads
were married, too.

01:14:18.096 --> 01:14:19.514
Son of a bitch.

01:14:20.474 --> 01:14:22.350
I thought we were going upstairs.

01:14:22.434 --> 01:14:25.270
Yeah, I know.
I love you. I'm not gonna lose you again.

01:14:25.353 --> 01:14:26.897
We are getting married tonight.

01:14:27.022 --> 01:14:28.648
We're gonna drive to Maryland.

01:14:28.732 --> 01:14:30.025
I don't know why I didn't think
of it before.

01:14:30.108 --> 01:14:33.278
Freddie always marries there.
You don't need a blood test down there.

01:14:34.112 --> 01:14:36.364
There's this dinner
with the president. Damn!

01:14:36.531 --> 01:14:40.827
Hey, that's okay!
We'll go to Maryland after dinner.

01:14:40.911 --> 01:14:42.454
We'll already be dressed up!

01:14:42.537 --> 01:14:43.789
I haven't told you...

01:14:43.872 --> 01:14:45.665
I know.
You haven't told me this big secret.

01:14:45.749 --> 01:14:48.168
That's okay.
Tell me on the way to Maryland.

01:14:49.753 --> 01:14:51.088
Ooh!

01:15:21.326 --> 01:15:24.371
You know what I hope?
I hope we have a boy and a girl.

01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:28.041
What kind?

01:15:29.626 --> 01:15:32.838
What kind? The young kind, I guess.

01:15:32.963 --> 01:15:35.173
The older ones are
a little hard to deliver.

01:15:36.049 --> 01:15:37.551
We're getting married tonight.

01:15:37.717 --> 01:15:39.761
- Wonderful.
-Thank you.

01:15:40.887 --> 01:15:43.098
Why is this bread in here
instead of out there?

01:15:43.431 --> 01:15:45.267
The butter is hard like a rock.

01:15:46.518 --> 01:15:48.270
Do you have a broken arm?

01:15:48.645 --> 01:15:52.107
No, it's fractured in 16 places.

01:15:52.607 --> 01:15:54.025
Why are you here?

01:15:56.278 --> 01:15:57.445
The union sent me.

01:15:59.656 --> 01:16:02.909
My God, the president is here!

01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:06.413
The president's here.
The president's here!

01:16:24.347 --> 01:16:25.682
Hmm.

01:16:42.157 --> 01:16:47.329
<i>I'm just a corn-fed Kansas boy,
but you are the Big Apple of my eye.</i>

01:16:48.705 --> 01:16:50.123
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:16:51.374 --> 01:16:52.584
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:16:52.876 --> 01:16:54.336
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

01:16:56.504 --> 01:16:59.341
<i>Thank you.
It's great to be back in New York.</i>

01:17:11.645 --> 01:17:13.313
Alert. Alert. Table 5.

01:17:13.521 --> 01:17:15.523
<i>Intercept busboy
with suspicious hump.</i>

01:17:19.027 --> 01:17:20.820
He's reaching! Get him now!

01:17:22.030 --> 01:17:23.990
- Sir, I'd like a word with you, please.
-About what?

01:17:24.449 --> 01:17:26.159
This has nothing to do
with the president.

01:17:26.368 --> 01:17:27.786
This has nothing to do
with the president!

01:17:31.665 --> 01:17:34.876
<i>Well, I guess he just found out
what his dinner cost.</i>

01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:40.674
I want to talk to the press.

01:17:40.966 --> 01:17:42.550
I want to talk to the press.

01:17:43.718 --> 01:17:45.637
I have a formal statement to make!

01:17:46.554 --> 01:17:49.224
<i>In Bob Hollins,
you have a <i>candidate for Congress</i></i>

01:17:49.307 --> 01:17:50.976
<i>who is in touch with the people.</i>

01:17:51.226 --> 01:17:54.562
<i>A man who built up the business
left to him by his grandfather.</i>

01:17:55.313 --> 01:17:57.315
<i>What was once a small
pushcart on wheels...</i>

01:17:58.191 --> 01:18:00.068
- Allen?
-Yeah?

01:18:00.652 --> 01:18:02.237
It's time for me to tell you.

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:04.823
What? Now?

01:18:05.657 --> 01:18:08.410
- Right now.
-Okay. Great.

01:18:08.493 --> 01:18:10.203
- Not here.
-Fine. Fine.

01:18:10.287 --> 01:18:12.247
<i>But more importantly,
with fresh meat.</i>

01:18:15.375 --> 01:18:17.836
I am not crazy.
There's a mermaid in there.

01:18:17.919 --> 01:18:19.879
- Shut up.
-I am a scientist!

01:18:20.839 --> 01:18:22.465
Where's the goddamn car!

01:18:23.591 --> 01:18:25.176
The gray BMW.

01:18:30.015 --> 01:18:31.725
Hey, I know that guy.

01:18:31.975 --> 01:18:34.811
I saw him on Cape Cod.
He was crazy then.

01:18:36.187 --> 01:18:38.857
There she is! There she is!

01:18:41.609 --> 01:18:43.445
- Don't let him shoot that.
-That a gun?

01:18:44.446 --> 01:18:46.239
- Hold it!
-No!

01:18:46.614 --> 01:18:48.283
Get that thing out of his hand.

01:18:49.784 --> 01:18:51.244
Grab that hose!

01:18:51.786 --> 01:18:54.664
Grab him! Get him!

01:18:59.502 --> 01:19:01.379
- No!
-What's going on?

01:19:20.565 --> 01:19:22.567
I was right!

01:19:23.485 --> 01:19:26.154
Behold the mermaid!

01:19:33.370 --> 01:19:34.996
Let me outta here!

01:19:35.497 --> 01:19:37.290
Who are you? What is your name?

01:19:37.499 --> 01:19:38.917
Allen!

01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:42.670
- What do we do?
-Grab her. Grab everybody.

01:19:43.505 --> 01:19:44.839
I want to see her.

01:19:44.923 --> 01:19:46.174
Allen!

01:19:48.510 --> 01:19:50.011
Get her! Get her!

01:19:51.679 --> 01:19:52.764
Allen!

01:19:57.227 --> 01:19:58.561
Please?

01:19:58.686 --> 01:20:01.648
- Let's pick her up.
-Allen. Allen!

01:20:13.868 --> 01:20:15.537
Allen!

01:20:22.752 --> 01:20:24.379
Good afternoon, Dr. Ross.

01:20:26.047 --> 01:20:28.216
<i>Dr. Hill, line 5. Stat!</i>

01:20:31.511 --> 01:20:32.554
- Buckwalter.
-Sir!

01:20:34.222 --> 01:20:35.723
Gentlemen.

01:20:35.974 --> 01:20:37.767
- Anything?
-No change.

01:20:48.528 --> 01:20:50.488
I am not a fish!

01:20:51.197 --> 01:20:54.576
How many times
do I have to tell you that?

01:20:55.785 --> 01:20:58.872
Will you just let me out of here?

01:20:58.955 --> 01:21:01.833
Please? Huh? People?

01:21:02.959 --> 01:21:04.419
Let's try some interaction.

01:21:04.878 --> 01:21:06.671
Fine. Jim?

01:21:59.098 --> 01:22:02.310
I guess they thought you might be one.

01:22:04.437 --> 01:22:05.688
Yeah.

01:22:06.898 --> 01:22:08.316
I guess so.

01:22:10.610 --> 01:22:13.279
You said whatever my secret was,
you'd understand.

01:22:15.114 --> 01:22:16.449
I know.

01:22:20.453 --> 01:22:22.497
You thought
at least I was a human being.

01:22:30.755 --> 01:22:32.507
Allen?

01:22:49.190 --> 01:22:52.318
He's been in the water 12 hours.
He's just a man.

01:22:52.443 --> 01:22:55.071
Get him out of there
so we can concentrate on her.

01:23:06.749 --> 01:23:09.377
Greg Martin, WMET Radio,
here with Allen Bauer.

01:23:09.877 --> 01:23:13.006
- When did you meet the mermaid?
-Tell me, where did you meet?

01:23:13.590 --> 01:23:15.383
Did you know she was a mermaid?

01:23:15.466 --> 01:23:19.262
- Did you actually make love to her?
-That's a stupid question.

01:23:19.345 --> 01:23:20.763
Did she eat worms?

01:23:21.431 --> 01:23:23.850
Would you have to make
love to her in water?

01:23:24.058 --> 01:23:25.727
That's none of your business.

01:23:25.810 --> 01:23:28.229
Is she a mutant or missing link?

01:23:28.646 --> 01:23:29.897
No, she's not.

01:23:29.981 --> 01:23:33.318
I'm from <i>People</i> magazine.
ls she also seeing Burt Reynolds?

01:23:33.901 --> 01:23:35.361
For crying out loud!

01:23:39.824 --> 01:23:41.075
Leave him alone!

01:23:41.576 --> 01:23:45.246
Leave him alone! Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

01:23:46.039 --> 01:23:47.832
- Let me through.
-Out of the way.

01:23:47.915 --> 01:23:51.169
- Allen, you all right?
-Yeah. Get me out of here.

01:23:51.252 --> 01:23:53.463
Is anyone here
from Penthouse magazine?

01:23:53.546 --> 01:23:55.465
- No.
- Then we ain't talking.

01:24:17.654 --> 01:24:18.905
Hey, Allen?

01:24:26.287 --> 01:24:27.455
What are you looking at?

01:24:27.622 --> 01:24:29.874
You never saw a guy
who slept with a fish before?

01:24:29.957 --> 01:24:31.459
Get back to work!

01:24:34.212 --> 01:24:38.758
Mr. Bauer, you had a million messages.
I wrote them down right here.

01:24:38.966 --> 01:24:44.097
You got calls from CBS, NBC, ABC, AP,

01:24:44.472 --> 01:24:48.142
<i>UPI, Ted Turner, Time, Newsweek,</i>

01:24:48.226 --> 01:24:50.978
Marineland, Ripley's Believe It or Not,

01:24:51.312 --> 01:24:53.022
and Mrs. Paul.

01:24:53.564 --> 01:24:55.066
Not now, Mrs. Stimler.

01:25:00.988 --> 01:25:02.281
"Fishman"?

01:25:03.408 --> 01:25:04.701
"Fishman"?

01:25:06.703 --> 01:25:08.413
That's what they're
calling you on TV, too.

01:25:08.830 --> 01:25:10.498
Personally, I think it's kinda cute.

01:25:15.461 --> 01:25:16.713
So, how is she?

01:25:17.088 --> 01:25:18.256
How is she?

01:25:18.339 --> 01:25:19.966
She's a...

01:25:21.134 --> 01:25:22.343
She's a mermaid.

01:25:23.010 --> 01:25:24.178
I don't understand.

01:25:25.638 --> 01:25:28.182
All my life I've been waiting for someone

01:25:28.850 --> 01:25:32.854
and when I find her, she's a fish.

01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:35.523
Nobody said love's perfect!

01:25:35.898 --> 01:25:40.236
Oh, Freddie,
I don't expect it to be perfect,

01:25:40.319 --> 01:25:43.114
but for God's sake, it's usually human!

01:25:45.533 --> 01:25:48.244
Every day people meet
and they fall in love.

01:25:48.453 --> 01:25:49.746
Look what I got.

01:25:51.914 --> 01:25:55.042
Look what you got.
Yeah, let's look at what you got.

01:25:56.586 --> 01:25:58.880
Let's take a good look at what you got.

01:25:59.714 --> 01:26:01.799
People fall in love every day, huh?
ls that what you said?

01:26:01.883 --> 01:26:03.301
- Yeah.
-Yeah?

01:26:03.384 --> 01:26:05.845
That's a crock! It doesn't work that way.

01:26:06.888 --> 01:26:08.931
Do you realize how happy
you were with her?

01:26:09.015 --> 01:26:11.350
That is, when you weren't
driving yourself crazy.

01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:14.353
Every day? Come on.

01:26:14.896 --> 01:26:18.441
Some people will never be that happy!
I'll never be that happy.

01:26:23.529 --> 01:26:24.989
What am I talking to you for?

01:26:25.531 --> 01:26:27.533
You don't know nothing. Mrs. Stimler?

01:27:01.776 --> 01:27:03.277
Does she look a little pale?

01:27:05.279 --> 01:27:07.532
Ah, that's a good day's work.

01:27:08.032 --> 01:27:10.952
Tomorrow, I want to see
how she interacts

01:27:11.035 --> 01:27:14.413
with other marine life,
then the internal examination.

01:27:16.999 --> 01:27:18.459
Internal examination.

01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:21.587
Of course.
I want to study her pulmonary system,

01:27:21.671 --> 01:27:23.381
reproductive organs, everything!

01:27:23.464 --> 01:27:24.757
Dr. Ross?

01:27:26.342 --> 01:27:28.302
Are we considering

01:27:28.928 --> 01:27:32.557
how the subject is responding
to the examination procedure?

01:27:32.682 --> 01:27:34.642
I'm considering everything!

01:27:35.726 --> 01:27:39.856
Ah, yes.
Well, I'm sure you are, Dr. Ross.

01:27:39.981 --> 01:27:42.984
How stupid of me.
But let me ask you this.

01:27:43.067 --> 01:27:47.321
Are you considering the possibility
that you might be a sadistic pig?

01:27:52.159 --> 01:27:55.580
While we are baring
our souls, Mr. Kornbluth,

01:27:55.663 --> 01:27:59.292
I must honestly tell you I have never
considered you a man of science.

01:27:59.834 --> 01:28:02.295
You're not a member of my team.

01:28:02.837 --> 01:28:07.174
Run along, Walter.
See if you can't find a unicorn.

01:29:17.078 --> 01:29:18.079
What's that?

01:29:18.162 --> 01:29:19.956
Painkiller, Mr. Kornbluth.

01:29:20.122 --> 01:29:22.416
Whoever punched you
cracked your tooth.

01:29:22.750 --> 01:29:25.211
We'll be very close to the nerve.

01:29:25.419 --> 01:29:28.714
I don't deserve painkiller. Just drill.

01:29:29.048 --> 01:29:33.094
Oh, you want pain.
Well, we aim to please.

01:29:36.764 --> 01:29:37.848
Get out.

01:29:38.182 --> 01:29:39.725
- What are you...
-Get out!

01:29:40.017 --> 01:29:42.353
- Ja, ja, ja.
-Please stay. Ahh!

01:29:45.606 --> 01:29:46.774
Let's talk.

01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:51.862
Hey, put that down.

01:29:51.988 --> 01:29:54.281
- Put that needle down.
-Stay away from me.

01:29:54.448 --> 01:29:56.784
I said, "Let's talk." Put it down.

01:29:56.867 --> 01:29:58.202
Stay away from me.

01:30:04.166 --> 01:30:05.501
Ahhh!

01:30:06.043 --> 01:30:09.463
Ahhh! Ohhh!

01:30:11.215 --> 01:30:12.383
Uh.

01:30:14.802 --> 01:30:15.970
Ah!

01:30:17.471 --> 01:30:18.597
Ah!

01:30:19.765 --> 01:30:20.933
Ah!

01:30:21.559 --> 01:30:23.185
What a week I'm having!

01:30:26.647 --> 01:30:28.357
You've destroyed my life, Kornbluth.

01:30:28.607 --> 01:30:29.942
I didn't mean to.

01:30:31.944 --> 01:30:34.447
I just had to prove that I wasn't crazy.

01:30:35.156 --> 01:30:36.615
I'm a man of science.

01:30:40.369 --> 01:30:43.122
I just didn't think about
how it would affect you.

01:30:44.707 --> 01:30:45.958
Or her.

01:30:47.168 --> 01:30:48.502
I'm really a nice guy.

01:30:49.211 --> 01:30:50.880
If I had friends, you could ask them.

01:30:52.339 --> 01:30:53.966
I've been on the phone
to every employee

01:30:54.050 --> 01:30:55.551
of the United States government

01:30:55.718 --> 01:30:57.219
calling them sons of bitches.

01:31:00.222 --> 01:31:02.349
Nobody could even get in to see her.

01:31:05.311 --> 01:31:06.395
I can.

01:31:09.648 --> 01:31:11.358
Come on. Come on!

01:31:11.859 --> 01:31:13.527
- Ahh!
-Come on.

01:31:55.486 --> 01:31:59.448
Good afternoon, Dr. Kornbluth.
I wasn't expecting you today.

01:31:59.532 --> 01:32:03.077
These are Drs. Jarred and Johannsen
from the Stockholm Institute.

01:32:03.577 --> 01:32:05.371
I thought they were
coming later with Dr. Ross.

01:32:06.872 --> 01:32:09.917
No, no. That story was to fool the press.

01:32:12.294 --> 01:32:13.921
You know, I'm half Swedish.

01:32:18.926 --> 01:32:20.594
- Ja.
-Ja.

01:32:24.265 --> 01:32:26.725
- Ja.
-Oh, ja.

01:32:28.686 --> 01:32:29.770
Well!

01:32:30.437 --> 01:32:31.856
Just a second.

01:32:48.330 --> 01:32:49.456
Ah.

01:33:02.136 --> 01:33:04.471
- How the hell did you do that?
-Let me tell you.

01:33:04.763 --> 01:33:07.057
Many nudie films come from Sweden.

01:33:07.224 --> 01:33:11.020
After you see them 400 or 500 times,
the stuff sinks in.

01:33:13.189 --> 01:33:14.315
Afternoon, Buckwalter.

01:33:14.398 --> 01:33:16.567
Sorry, no one comes in

01:33:16.692 --> 01:33:18.652
until Dr. Ross gets back
with them Swede people.

01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:20.654
These are the Swedish doctors.

01:33:21.488 --> 01:33:23.073
These are Swedes?

01:33:24.241 --> 01:33:26.035
Ah, come here.

01:33:26.410 --> 01:33:29.830
Isn't that one kinda dark?

01:33:30.831 --> 01:33:32.499
He's dirty from the trip!

01:33:32.833 --> 01:33:34.460
Let us in.

01:33:34.543 --> 01:33:36.879
- I'm not supposed to.
-What are you afraid of?

01:33:37.338 --> 01:33:40.049
Do you think we're
gonna steal the mermaid?

01:33:41.675 --> 01:33:44.261
Steal the mermaid.
Stealing the mermaid!

01:33:44.345 --> 01:33:46.847
Are we gonna fold her in half
and put her in a briefcase?

01:33:46.931 --> 01:33:48.933
In a briefcase. In half.

01:33:49.475 --> 01:33:51.644
I guess it's all right.

01:33:51.727 --> 01:33:53.562
Go in. Go in.

01:33:53.854 --> 01:33:55.731
- Good joke, there.
-Yeah.

01:34:30.557 --> 01:34:32.268
- Hi.
-Hi.

01:34:34.186 --> 01:34:36.563
Is this the big secret
you've been keeping?

01:34:37.147 --> 01:34:39.608
That you're a mermaid,
or is there something else?

01:34:40.401 --> 01:34:41.902
No, that's it.

01:34:45.114 --> 01:34:47.950
Allen, don't feel guilty.

01:34:48.534 --> 01:34:49.910
Guilty? About what?

01:34:50.744 --> 01:34:52.329
About not loving me anymore.

01:34:54.498 --> 01:34:56.750
Oh, Madison.

01:34:57.334 --> 01:35:00.963
All the time we were together,
you always knew how I was feeling.

01:35:02.381 --> 01:35:03.924
Can't you tell now?

01:35:13.976 --> 01:35:17.062
<i>Well, left my wife in New Orleans</i>

01:35:17.229 --> 01:35:19.315
<i>48 kids and a can of beans</i>

01:35:19.523 --> 01:35:20.899
<i>Left, right, one, two</i>

01:35:20.983 --> 01:35:22.401
Oh, my God!

01:35:22.484 --> 01:35:24.278
- What?
-Stand back, man.

01:35:24.611 --> 01:35:27.448
Cover his face, for God's sake!

01:35:28.115 --> 01:35:30.326
What happened? What's going on?

01:35:30.451 --> 01:35:33.370
Dr. Johannsen bent down
to examine that creature.

01:35:33.454 --> 01:35:36.165
And suddenly these rays
came out of her eyes!

01:35:36.415 --> 01:35:39.418
Don't go in there!
She'll melt your face off.

01:35:39.626 --> 01:35:41.712
I knew something would happen.
What should I do?

01:35:41.795 --> 01:35:44.214
Don't whine. Seal off the area.

01:35:44.298 --> 01:35:45.507
I'll call the Pentagon.

01:35:45.632 --> 01:35:48.218
Are you crazy?
You want to create a national panic?

01:35:48.302 --> 01:35:50.179
I don't want to die!

01:35:50.262 --> 01:35:51.638
Pull yourself together.

01:35:51.722 --> 01:35:53.891
Don't let anybody in that room.

01:35:53.974 --> 01:35:57.186
I'll be back with nuclear weapons.
Come on, Doctor.

01:36:25.005 --> 01:36:27.216
Good afternoon, Dr. Ross.
Who are your guests?

01:36:27.299 --> 01:36:29.843
Drs. Jarred and Johannsen
from the Swedish Institute.

01:36:30.677 --> 01:36:32.012
Sir?

01:36:32.721 --> 01:36:36.683
Dr. Kornbluth left with
the Swedes a few minutes ago.

01:36:44.525 --> 01:36:47.444
Hiya, boys. Come in. The water's fine.

01:36:50.656 --> 01:36:54.326
Let's get her back, now! And arrest him.

01:37:09.425 --> 01:37:12.678
<i>We have a <i>blue BMW Over.</i></i>

01:37:36.076 --> 01:37:37.995
--Come on.

01:37:38.912 --> 01:37:41.707
Know something?
I don't think we're being followed.

01:37:42.291 --> 01:37:44.918
Wha... Well, that was easy.

01:37:45.252 --> 01:37:47.921
That was simple! We did it!

01:37:48.589 --> 01:37:50.841
- My plan.
- You're a genius.

01:37:50.924 --> 01:37:53.677
I am a genius,
but you came in with the Swedish thing.

01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:56.555
That was a brilliant touch.

01:37:57.514 --> 01:37:59.475
I didn't even like you when we first met.

01:37:59.558 --> 01:38:01.810
Nobody likes me
when they first meet me.

01:38:03.854 --> 01:38:05.063
Allen?

01:38:13.113 --> 01:38:15.240
- Move!
-All right. Here we go!

01:38:31.965 --> 01:38:34.176
<i>Suspect heading south on Broadway.</i>

01:39:06.833 --> 01:39:10.337
<i>Unit One. Lost them
in the Wall Street district. Over.</i>

01:39:14.258 --> 01:39:15.300
- Stop the car.
-What?

01:39:15.384 --> 01:39:18.262
Stop and let me out.
I'll slow them down. Do it!

01:39:25.185 --> 01:39:28.230
I caused all this.
Now I'm gonna finish it.

01:39:37.364 --> 01:39:38.907
Get the hell out of here.

01:39:39.741 --> 01:39:41.034
Go!

01:39:58.885 --> 01:40:00.387
Whoa! Ooh.

01:40:03.223 --> 01:40:05.392
What a week I'm having!

01:40:20.991 --> 01:40:23.243
Hey, Mac, move that thing out of here.

01:40:24.745 --> 01:40:27.039
Up yours, Gomer. I'm waitin' for a fare.

01:40:34.755 --> 01:40:37.341
Heave!

01:40:39.259 --> 01:40:41.011
All right. Move out.

01:40:42.721 --> 01:40:44.056
Come on, let's go!

01:41:10.957 --> 01:41:13.293
- I was ready to stay with you forever.
-I know.

01:41:13.460 --> 01:41:16.129
They know who you are.
They won't leave you alone.

01:41:16.797 --> 01:41:18.590
I can't ever come back to you.

01:41:19.633 --> 01:41:21.301
I wish I could go with you.

01:41:22.636 --> 01:41:23.762
You can.

01:41:24.012 --> 01:41:26.014
- How?
-It can be done.

01:41:26.556 --> 01:41:30.227
Remember when you were eight
and fell off the ship?

01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:32.604
You were safe under the water,
weren't you?

01:41:33.980 --> 01:41:35.107
Yeah.

01:41:35.816 --> 01:41:37.317
You were with me.

01:41:39.277 --> 01:41:40.862
You mean, that was real?

01:41:42.364 --> 01:41:43.865
That was you?

01:41:44.825 --> 01:41:46.326
That was you!

01:41:50.664 --> 01:41:52.791
This is great. This is great!

01:41:52.958 --> 01:41:56.169
I can go with you and still come back
and see Freddie at Christmas.

01:41:58.338 --> 01:41:59.923
You can't ever come back.

01:42:14.104 --> 01:42:15.605
Madison.

01:42:18.650 --> 01:42:20.152
I understand.

01:42:29.995 --> 01:42:33.832
<i>You on the dock, don't move.
You're under arrest.</i>

01:42:34.374 --> 01:42:38.545
<i>Let the girl go. Step back.
You're under arrest.</i>

01:42:38.712 --> 01:42:40.213
You have to go.

01:42:40.672 --> 01:42:42.257
Move out. Let's go!

01:42:44.009 --> 01:42:45.594
I love you, Madison.

01:42:47.888 --> 01:42:49.055
Go.

01:42:51.433 --> 01:42:53.226
Go!

01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:02.277
<i>Get that guy on the dock.</i>

01:43:04.321 --> 01:43:05.739
Leave her alone!

01:43:08.867 --> 01:43:10.368
Leave her alone!

01:43:21.421 --> 01:43:22.756
Madison.

01:43:30.180 --> 01:43:31.473
Madison!

01:43:42.317 --> 01:43:44.444
<i>Stay where you are. We'll get you out.</i>

01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:50.826
Madison!

01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:40.208
Ooh!

01:45:12.824 --> 01:45:15.285
<i>One fine day</i>

01:45:17.871 --> 01:45:21.374
<i>Love came for me</i>

01:45:24.210 --> 01:45:27.672
<i>And love was rare</i>

01:45:30.133 --> 01:45:33.887
<i>As love can be</i>

01:45:36.056 --> 01:45:40.727
<i>I saw stars</i>

01:45:41.728 --> 01:45:46.900
<i>Shining in clear blue skies</i>

01:45:47.692 --> 01:45:51.488
<i>We flowed together</i>

01:45:53.448 --> 01:45:57.452
<i>Once and forever</i>

01:45:59.287 --> 01:46:03.458
<i>Love came for me</i>

01:46:05.335 --> 01:46:09.005
<i>One fine night</i>

01:46:11.091 --> 01:46:14.803
<i>Love let us see</i>

01:46:16.972 --> 01:46:20.433
<i>How far we'll go</i>

01:46:22.769 --> 01:46:26.439
<i>How good we'll be</i>

01:46:28.525 --> 01:46:32.779
<i>We saw a world</i>

01:46:33.738 --> 01:46:38.994
<i>No one ever saw before</i>

01:46:40.245 --> 01:46:43.581
<i>It was the world</i>

01:46:43.665 --> 01:46:46.459
<i>Love can start</i>

01:46:47.168 --> 01:46:51.548
<i>With a beat of a heart</i>

01:46:51.881 --> 01:46:55.885
<i>Love came for me</i>

01:47:21.619 --> 01:47:25.248
<i>I saw stars</i>

01:47:26.958 --> 01:47:31.671
<i>Shining in clear blue skies</i>

01:47:32.839 --> 01:47:36.342
<i>We flowed together</i>

01:47:38.595 --> 01:47:42.515
<i>Once and forever</i>
