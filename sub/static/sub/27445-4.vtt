WEBVTT

00:06.354 --> 00:08.269
Better Things, all new.
Thursdays at 10:00.

00:08.312 --> 00:10.923
Starts February 28 on FX.

00:13.274 --> 00:16.407
FXX presentsYou're the Worst.

00:21.151 --> 00:23.719
What is it about morning boners?

00:23.762 --> 00:25.895
Yeah, it's not the boner.

00:25.938 --> 00:29.116
It's that my haunches
are fresh and rested.

00:29.159 --> 00:31.161
Like when you take
a thoroughbred to the track

00:31.205 --> 00:34.730
first thing in the morning,
fastest time of the day.

00:39.126 --> 00:40.344
What?

00:43.739 --> 00:44.957
Oh, no.

00:45.001 --> 00:47.308
Oh, yes.
Jimmy, I think it's time.

00:47.351 --> 00:49.527
-No. No, not today.

00:49.571 --> 00:51.486
-You promised me
you would do this.
-I don't feel good.

00:51.529 --> 00:54.097
Is that the message you want
to give your bride, Jimmy?

00:54.141 --> 00:55.794
That you're not willing
to do something

00:55.838 --> 00:58.362
that is extremely, extremely

00:58.406 --> 00:59.798
important to me?

01:01.148 --> 01:03.150
Fine. I'll taste my come.

01:03.193 --> 01:05.326
Yay!

01:15.945 --> 01:18.774
What do you think, Jimmy?
Do you hate it

01:18.817 --> 01:22.169
Do you think it's gross, Jimmy?
What do you think, Jimmy?

01:22.212 --> 01:24.997
It's like... salty fruit glue.

01:25.041 --> 01:27.478
Exactly.

01:27.522 --> 01:29.393
-Oh.

01:29.437 --> 01:32.527
My Lyft is here.
I'm gonna hop in the shower.

01:32.570 --> 01:35.269
What? They're not gonna
just wait for you.

01:35.312 --> 01:36.574
You tell them you're
in a wheelchair.

01:36.618 --> 01:38.794
Then they legally have to wait
as long as you want.

01:38.837 --> 01:40.317
Wait, have you just been
Lyfting everywhere

01:40.361 --> 01:41.840
since you wrecked your car?

01:41.884 --> 01:44.365
I can't drive, Jimmy.

01:44.408 --> 01:46.280
Every time I close my eyes,

01:46.323 --> 01:48.760
I see that cement mixer
bearing down on me.

01:48.804 --> 01:50.588
You faked it, you psychopath.

01:50.632 --> 01:52.329
Oh.

01:52.373 --> 01:55.680
Whoa. I'm starting
to believe my own lies.

02:05.255 --> 02:08.084
Oh, my God! You love it!

02:08.128 --> 02:10.042
No! No, I do not.

02:10.086 --> 02:12.393
What? You're lapping it up
like it's soft serve.

02:12.436 --> 02:14.046
I

02:14.090 --> 02:16.223
I was making sure
that it just tasted as weird

02:16.266 --> 02:17.528
as I thought it did.

02:17.572 --> 02:19.443
You just Oliver'd your own come.

02:19.487 --> 02:21.228
: "Please, sir,
may I have some more?"

02:21.271 --> 02:23.012
You said it was
important to you!

02:23.055 --> 02:25.232
When I was watching,
not on your own,

02:25.275 --> 02:29.279
like some come-hungry
jizz

02:40.247 --> 02:43.424
♪ I'm gonna leave you anyway♪

02:43.467 --> 02:46.470
♪ I'm gonna leave you
anyway♪

02:46.514 --> 02:49.081
♪ Gonna leave you anyway.♪

03:05.446 --> 03:07.448
♪

03:20.548 --> 03:22.332
Brilliant,

03:22.376 --> 03:26.075
absolutely brilliant.

03:31.515 --> 03:36.259
Gretchen, something
amazing's happened!

03:36.303 --> 03:38.392
What

03:38.435 --> 03:40.698
What?

03:43.135 --> 03:44.963
Library card.
I just got a library card.

03:45.007 --> 03:48.053
Not exactly amazing news,
but you're on a come high.

03:48.097 --> 03:49.359
I've been there.

03:53.363 --> 03:54.756
What?

03:54.799 --> 03:58.281
How's someone in a wheelchair
supposed to walk to their ride?

03:58.325 --> 04:00.414
Come on, Jimmy, think.

04:33.360 --> 04:36.145
♪

05:46.998 --> 05:49.087
Lindsay, you have
your own office.

05:49.131 --> 05:53.265
I do? Awesome.
Does it have a sex toilet?

05:53.309 --> 05:54.789
Here's your breakfast,
Ms. Cottumaccio.

05:54.832 --> 05:57.226
Hmm. Apparently,
I have an office,

05:57.269 --> 05:58.749
so I'll need some supplies.

05:58.793 --> 06:00.751
Uh, kitty posters
with inspiring quotes,

06:00.795 --> 06:04.668
finger paints, a sex toilet,
popcorn machine, etcets.

06:04.712 --> 06:05.582
Who are you?

06:05.626 --> 06:06.583
He's my new assistant.

06:06.627 --> 06:08.411
I'm actually your assistant.

06:08.455 --> 06:09.543
I have an assistant?

06:09.586 --> 06:11.458
Dismissed.

06:11.501 --> 06:13.547
So, what do Sam and the boys
think about me

06:13.590 --> 06:15.462
being their whatchamacallit,
paleontologist?

06:15.505 --> 06:17.289
Publicist.

06:17.333 --> 06:20.118
I haven't told them yet.
Sam takes rejection really hard.

06:20.162 --> 06:23.034
Mm, we should do it someplace
fun to soften the blow,

06:23.078 --> 06:24.819
like the beach or a rub 'n tug.

06:24.862 --> 06:29.127
Good idea.
But I have to do it alone.

06:29.171 --> 06:30.694
Meanwhile, you need to focus

06:30.738 --> 06:32.435
and learn how
to actually do the job.

06:32.479 --> 06:34.002
Fine, but for the record,

06:34.045 --> 06:36.483
I really only took this gig
to be closer to you,

06:36.526 --> 06:39.007
since you're ditching me
to become a stupid wife.

06:39.050 --> 06:41.705
Literally nothing will change

06:41.749 --> 06:43.446
except that my debt
will be on the J-dog

06:43.490 --> 06:45.361
and the beejays will
slow to a trickle

06:45.405 --> 06:48.364
because...  come on.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.149
Hmm.

06:51.193 --> 06:55.371
PAUL:
Mm-hmm. I'm glad you called me.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.678
You're not the only person
to make a foolish purchase

06:57.721 --> 06:59.462
upon receiving
their first big check.

06:59.506 --> 07:02.334
Why, when I received my first

07:02.378 --> 07:03.727
stout remittance,

07:03.771 --> 07:06.513
I went absolutely cuckoo

07:06.556 --> 07:10.821
and purchased a 20,000-piece
puzzle of the Eye of the Sahara.

07:12.997 --> 07:15.957
That was a decadent three weeks.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.613
Anyway, the puzzle
we're focused on today

07:19.656 --> 07:22.485
is called,
"Jimmy's financial future."

07:22.529 --> 07:24.269
Yeah, I was really
just thinking about,

07:24.313 --> 07:26.750
like, opening a CD or something.

07:26.794 --> 07:28.535
Jimmy. You're asking
for flank steak

07:28.578 --> 07:31.189
when I'm about to offer you
dry-aged Wagyu.

07:31.233 --> 07:34.715
$700,000 is a robust start.

07:34.758 --> 07:38.283
Assuming a continued
upward career trajectory,

07:38.327 --> 07:40.677
you'll be part of
the one percent in no time.

07:42.244 --> 07:45.203
Can you imagine

07:45.247 --> 07:47.336
A one-percenter.

07:47.379 --> 07:48.903
Cabins in Aspen,

07:48.946 --> 07:52.776
golf with corrupt politicians,
an embarrassing car collection

07:52.820 --> 07:55.649
kept in some Van Nuysian
airport hangar.

07:55.692 --> 07:57.085
Now you're getting it.

07:57.128 --> 07:59.304
I mean, I've always felt elite.

07:59.348 --> 08:00.958
You know, when Gretchen said
that she...

08:01.002 --> 08:02.699
Oh, dear. Does Gretchen
know about the money?

08:02.743 --> 08:04.571
Not-not yet, but...

08:04.614 --> 08:06.311
-Quick, give me a dollar.
Why?

08:06.355 --> 08:08.270
Just do it!

08:09.358 --> 08:10.577
Okay.

08:10.620 --> 08:14.537
Phew. We've now established
confidentiality.

08:14.581 --> 08:16.713
Do you know
about Gretchen's debt?

08:16.757 --> 08:18.715
Yeah, but how do you?

08:18.759 --> 08:22.458
She's tried to open countless
credit cards in my name.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.592
Gretchen's what we call an S.D.,
a Super Dependent,

08:25.635 --> 08:29.421
like Rob Kardashian, or a dog
whose back legs don't work.

08:29.465 --> 08:31.598
Are you saying that
I should never tell Gretchen

08:31.641 --> 08:33.687
-As someone who believes

08:33.730 --> 08:36.820
in complete honesty
between romantic partners,

08:36.864 --> 08:39.606
I would say hiding something
like this is not recommended.

08:39.649 --> 08:42.260
-Yeah.
-As your financial advisor,

08:42.304 --> 08:44.915
I would say, "What money?"

08:47.614 --> 08:50.486
Well, back to the office.

08:52.183 --> 08:53.707
-Edgar.
-Jimmy.

08:53.750 --> 08:55.578
It's my abuelita.

08:55.622 --> 08:57.754
She's sick, Jimmy.

08:57.798 --> 08:59.364
Why are you telling me?

08:59.408 --> 09:01.628
I can't help her.
I don't have any money.

09:01.671 --> 09:04.631
EDGAR:
Oh. Thank God you believed me.

09:04.674 --> 09:06.850
I just need an excuse to get
out of work because yesterday

09:06.894 --> 09:09.636
Paul F. Tompkins made me drink
two liters of split pea soup.

09:09.679 --> 09:11.855
But also, geez, loud and clear.

09:16.686 --> 09:18.819
Edgar. I was just
picking up breakfast.

09:18.862 --> 09:20.603
I hope you like cronuts.

09:20.647 --> 09:21.952
Oh. That's right, you don't.

09:21.996 --> 09:23.650
Maybe you'll have a few anyway?

09:23.693 --> 09:24.868
Oh, that's actually
what I was calling about.

09:24.912 --> 09:28.872
It's... my... grandma.

09:29.786 --> 09:31.745
She's really sick.

09:31.788 --> 09:34.617
We-we don't know
how much longer she has.

09:34.661 --> 09:36.619
So I can't come in to work.

09:36.663 --> 09:39.622
Oh, my gosh, I had no idea.

09:39.666 --> 09:40.884
Take as much time as you need.

09:40.928 --> 09:42.625
Oh, thank you.

09:42.669 --> 09:45.410
Please. And let us know
if there's anything we can do.

09:45.454 --> 09:48.065
I will.

09:48.109 --> 09:50.894
Well, he seems like a monster.

09:50.938 --> 09:53.854
Gosh, maybe I've just been
too sensitive.

09:53.897 --> 09:55.899
I mean, a good fireworks display
does make you cry.

09:55.943 --> 09:59.773
-So, yeah, probably.

09:59.816 --> 10:00.817
Hmm.

10:01.818 --> 10:04.516
Ugh, what's wrong with you?

10:04.560 --> 10:07.215
: Have you seen Vernon?
-I try not to.

10:07.258 --> 10:10.697
Oh, Jimmy.
I'm so worried about him.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.829
With the embarrassment
of his medical license

10:12.873 --> 10:15.092
being suspended
and losing the house,

10:15.136 --> 10:16.877
not to mention Tallulah's eye
really going downhill,

10:16.920 --> 10:18.879
he's a wreck.

10:18.922 --> 10:22.230
He left this morning without
his phone or his wallet, Jimmy.

10:22.273 --> 10:25.668
Becca, trust me.
Vernon is far, far too stupid

10:25.712 --> 10:27.278
to be suicidal.

10:27.322 --> 10:30.499
Really?
I hope you're right.

10:30.542 --> 10:33.545
Could I take a shower?
Lindsay's water got shut off.

10:34.938 --> 10:37.375
-Two minutes,
but purely for hygiene.
-Mm-hmm.

10:37.419 --> 10:41.205
No sighing in relief
and no steam.

10:46.776 --> 10:50.737
Debase me, Jimmy,
like old times.

10:50.780 --> 10:52.695
I'm at rock bottom.

10:52.739 --> 10:55.263
Use my body so that
I might feel something.

10:55.306 --> 10:59.746
Uh, while I do find
Alcoholic Housewife Cosette

10:59.789 --> 11:01.748
to be a good look for you,

11:01.791 --> 11:03.750
I'm gonna have
to issue a hard pass.

11:06.970 --> 11:11.801
Please, just hold me, then.

11:11.845 --> 11:15.065
Ah. Jesus, woman.

11:15.109 --> 11:17.981
Let's not snot up
the linens now.

11:19.330 --> 11:20.723
Gotcha.

11:20.767 --> 11:21.942
-Oh.

11:21.985 --> 11:24.727
Paul told me
you're loaded.

11:24.771 --> 11:26.773
And if you don't slice me off
a hunk of that cheddar,

11:26.816 --> 11:30.428
then this photo goes straight to
your precious little fiancée.

11:30.472 --> 11:32.387
Checkmate, asswipe.

11:32.430 --> 11:33.780
That's your big play?

11:33.823 --> 11:35.956
Please, she'd think
it's hilarious.

11:35.999 --> 11:37.784
I'll do it! I swear I will!

11:37.827 --> 11:40.874
By contrast,
a good play would be,

11:40.917 --> 11:42.571
just off the top of my head,

11:42.614 --> 11:46.357
my declaration that if
you don't pay me $500...

11:46.401 --> 11:48.316
-...I'll send this picture

11:48.359 --> 11:50.666
to that horrid mother of yours
so she'll know

11:50.710 --> 11:52.450
that her own daughter
lied to her

11:52.494 --> 11:54.104
about having a vaginal birth.

12:02.852 --> 12:05.072
I will Venmo you.

12:12.383 --> 12:16.387
Look at me!
I'm flying, bitches.

12:16.431 --> 12:18.389
Stop flapping your arms.
You're gonna hurt someone.

12:18.433 --> 12:19.826
I'm Honey Nutz!

12:19.869 --> 12:21.828
♪ So I be break-breakin'

12:21.871 --> 12:23.960

12:31.098 --> 12:32.839
Who's ready for the piñata?

12:32.882 --> 12:35.015
-Oh, me first!
-Oh, yeah. Wait, I'll take that.

12:35.058 --> 12:36.625
-Give me that stick.

12:36.668 --> 12:38.801
-Hmm.

12:38.845 --> 12:40.063
I'm sorry.

12:40.107 --> 12:41.717
I know you told me
not to say anything,

12:41.761 --> 12:43.153
but we need to talk
about Honey Nutz.

12:43.197 --> 12:44.938
What is there to talk about?

12:44.981 --> 12:46.504
There's a clown.

12:49.856 --> 12:52.075
Wh

12:52.119 --> 12:54.077
I don't know
anyone named Zachary.

12:54.121 --> 12:56.036
He says hi.

12:56.079 --> 12:58.952
: I can't believe
you rebooted Honey Nutz.

13:04.305 --> 13:07.047
Bitch, do you know how much time

13:07.090 --> 13:08.744
I spent building that character?

13:08.788 --> 13:10.006
You think I'd give that up

13:10.050 --> 13:11.486
just 'cause Honey Nutz One
aged out?

13:11.529 --> 13:12.879
This is weird, right?

13:12.922 --> 13:14.881
So, uh,

13:14.924 --> 13:17.884
anyways, did I tell you guys
about my promotion?

13:19.102 --> 13:20.843
Wh

13:20.887 --> 13:22.845
This is precisely how my parents

13:22.889 --> 13:24.020
told me they were
getting divorced.

13:24.064 --> 13:25.848
They thought it wouldn't hurt
as much over mini golf.

13:25.892 --> 13:28.982
Now every time I see a windmill,
I throw up.

13:29.025 --> 13:31.723
-That's why I can never go
to the Netherlands.
-Come on.

13:31.767 --> 13:35.118
Gretchen wouldn't throw us
a carnival to give us bad news.

13:35.162 --> 13:36.641
She's not a monster.

13:36.685 --> 13:38.861
Guys, this is good news.

13:38.905 --> 13:40.689
-You're dumping us.
-I'm not dumping you.

13:40.732 --> 13:42.343
So we can still call you
whenever?

13:42.386 --> 13:43.735
Absolutely.

13:43.779 --> 13:46.086
You just call
your new point person,

13:46.129 --> 13:47.130
and they'll loop me in
if it's an emergency.

13:47.174 --> 13:48.915
And who is our new point person?

13:48.958 --> 13:51.439
Lindsay.
Isn't that amazing?

13:51.482 --> 13:53.963
I knew it!
You're abandoning us.

13:54.007 --> 13:55.965
Bitch!
I hate you!

13:58.750 --> 14:02.798
Your work has long been subpar,
but this still stings.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.948
All right, Edgar.

14:21.991 --> 14:22.949
I need to ask your advice
on something.

14:22.992 --> 14:24.733
-Hold it.

14:24.776 --> 14:26.561
Hold that thought.

14:32.610 --> 14:34.134
Hello, Mr. Tompkins.

14:34.177 --> 14:37.006
Edgar, there's the face
I wanted to time with.

14:37.050 --> 14:38.486
Any update onAbuelita?

14:38.529 --> 14:40.140
Sadly, yes.

14:40.183 --> 14:42.055
She's taken a turn
for the worse.

14:42.098 --> 14:44.013
That's curious.

14:44.057 --> 14:45.972
Because she looks
just fine to me.

14:46.015 --> 14:48.800
Um, I'm sorry, can...
can you repeat that?

14:48.844 --> 14:52.282
I said yourabuelita
looks just fine to me. See?

14:52.326 --> 14:53.980
Hola,mi tesoro.

14:54.023 --> 14:56.112
Your friend Paul--
he's so nice.

14:56.156 --> 14:58.419
:
It's a miracle, right?

14:58.462 --> 15:00.073
One minute she's taking a turn
for the worse,

15:00.116 --> 15:02.205
the next she's headed to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles

15:02.249 --> 15:04.164
with the nicest guy in comedy.

15:04.207 --> 15:06.557
We're getting waffles
with chicken, Edgar.

15:06.601 --> 15:09.647
So, since she's had
this miraculous recovery,

15:09.691 --> 15:12.041
I guess you can make it
into the office after all.

15:12.085 --> 15:15.044
Don't eat before.
We'll order in.

15:15.088 --> 15:17.655
So, I got this huge check.

15:17.699 --> 15:19.092
And you know the saying:

15:19.135 --> 15:22.008
"mo' money, mo' issues
with which to contend."

15:22.051 --> 15:24.010
If I tell Gretchen,

15:24.053 --> 15:26.664
then it will naturally change
our power dynamics.

15:26.708 --> 15:28.231
I will be perceived

15:28.275 --> 15:30.799
as an authority figure,
and then Gretchen will resist

15:30.842 --> 15:33.019
because she hates authority.

15:33.062 --> 15:34.759
I mean, I don't want to be

15:34.803 --> 15:36.892
The Man in our relationship.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.676
Oh, that last part
came out weird.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.591
You did just hear
that Paul F. Tompkins

15:40.635 --> 15:43.159
kidnapped my grandmother, right?

15:43.203 --> 15:46.771
To be fair, I believe I started
talking before the call.

15:46.815 --> 15:50.471
Besides, a comedian taking
your grandmother out to dinner

15:50.514 --> 15:52.560
does not sound like a problem.

15:52.603 --> 15:56.607
Ihave a problem.
I am incredibly rich.

16:10.404 --> 16:13.059
Jimmy, I have to apologize
for Bec's behavior.

16:13.102 --> 16:15.148
That was gross and inexcusable.

16:15.191 --> 16:17.585
Yeah, I agree.
Your wife is gross,

16:17.628 --> 16:19.195
and there's no excuse for it.

16:19.239 --> 16:22.807
Ever since I was born dead,
people-- life--

16:22.851 --> 16:24.896
have seemed ruled purely
by chaos.

16:24.940 --> 16:27.073
But losing everything

16:27.116 --> 16:29.640
has finally allowed me
to slow down,

16:29.684 --> 16:33.253
and I can see there's an order
to everything.

16:33.296 --> 16:35.907
Becca's the perfect example.

16:35.951 --> 16:37.822
Our whole marriage,
I could never predict

16:37.866 --> 16:39.694
what she was gonna do
from moment to moment.

16:39.737 --> 16:42.305
But now? The moment she learned
you had a few bucks,

16:42.349 --> 16:44.046
I knew exactly
what she was gonna do.

16:44.090 --> 16:46.831
Run over here to raise her tail.

16:46.875 --> 16:49.530
And I'm not mad at her.
You know why?

16:49.573 --> 16:52.098
Because losing everything--

16:52.141 --> 16:54.491
it's actually made us
close again.

16:54.535 --> 16:57.886
Take last night-- after Tallulah
went to sleep in her drawer,

16:57.929 --> 16:59.235
Becca and I fired up a joint,

16:59.279 --> 17:01.672
we sat on Lindsay's couch,
watching TV,

17:01.716 --> 17:04.197
laughing about this and that.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.677
And, unprompted,

17:06.721 --> 17:10.203
she started giving me
a hand job.

17:10.246 --> 17:13.858
And, Jimmy, I started to weep.

17:13.902 --> 17:16.731
There she was, the woman I love,

17:16.774 --> 17:18.298
sipping on boxed Chablis

17:18.341 --> 17:20.300
and spitting in her hand.

17:20.343 --> 17:24.434
I could really see her
for the first time.

17:24.478 --> 17:27.307
And now that I can,
I never want to stop.

17:27.350 --> 17:30.745
I don't want to go back
to the fog of work,

17:30.788 --> 17:32.877
accomplishments, achievement,

17:32.921 --> 17:34.096
money, money, money,

17:34.140 --> 17:36.229
taking everything
for fucking granted.

17:36.272 --> 17:38.492
I will not do that again.

17:38.535 --> 17:40.711
I will not, goddamn it.

17:40.755 --> 17:44.367
All we have are moments, Jimmy.

17:44.411 --> 17:46.152
Like that hand job.

17:46.195 --> 17:47.588
Like this moment.

17:47.631 --> 17:50.156
You sew enough
of those moments together,

17:50.199 --> 17:51.592
and, the next thing you know,

17:51.635 --> 17:55.378
you have a life
worth really seeing.

17:55.422 --> 17:59.165
Which is why I need you
to give me $14,000

17:59.208 --> 18:02.124
so I can convert
this Korean meatball truck

18:02.168 --> 18:03.560
into a roving medical unit.

18:03.604 --> 18:05.127
What do you say?

18:05.171 --> 18:06.781
You in or what?

18:06.824 --> 18:08.391
What?

18:08.435 --> 18:09.349
No.

18:09.392 --> 18:11.916
Well, had to try.

18:13.744 --> 18:15.137
Hey, babe.

18:15.181 --> 18:16.747
Nah, it didn't work
for me either.

18:16.791 --> 18:18.314
Yeah, he's being a jerk-off.

18:18.358 --> 18:19.837
Meet you out front in ten.

18:19.881 --> 18:21.404
Can we stop at Yogurtland?

18:21.448 --> 18:23.014
Aw, come on!

18:24.059 --> 18:25.756
She's on her way.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.845
-You gonna eat
that grilled cheese?

18:27.889 --> 18:30.152
-GRETCHEN: Ugh.
Who knew rappers could be

18:32.111 --> 18:33.373
Congrats on the big news.

18:33.416 --> 18:35.288
My promotion?

18:35.331 --> 18:37.290
You got promoted? Tight.

18:38.378 --> 18:39.857
That must be Lindser.

18:39.901 --> 18:42.295
We're finally gonna try
champ-pons tonight.

18:44.384 --> 18:46.125
It's huge on Reddit.

18:52.043 --> 18:53.567
Famous rappers. Noice!

18:53.610 --> 18:55.786
Put me in a video.
Don't be dicks.

18:55.830 --> 18:57.397
SAM:
We just came to tell you

18:57.440 --> 18:59.268
face-to-face
that you're not leaving us.

18:59.312 --> 19:01.227
Because we're leaving you first.

19:01.270 --> 19:02.445
Oh, snap.

19:04.273 --> 19:05.579
I am not leaving you guys.

19:05.622 --> 19:08.190
I am just expanding my team.

19:08.234 --> 19:09.757
I know you're worried
Lindsay won't be up

19:09.800 --> 19:11.280
for running point,
but I'm holding her hand

19:11.324 --> 19:12.325
through everything.

19:12.368 --> 19:13.804
Plus, she's crazy matured.

19:13.848 --> 19:15.676
LINDSAY:
Yee-haw!

19:15.719 --> 19:19.897
♪ Oh, our pussies
getting drunk tonight.♪

19:19.941 --> 19:22.378
Oh, hey.

19:22.422 --> 19:24.337
Well, if it isn't
my new favorite clients.

19:24.380 --> 19:26.469
SHITSTAIN:
We're not your clients.

19:26.513 --> 19:28.428
-We're leaving Caliber.

19:28.471 --> 19:30.778
LINDSAY:
Look, guys, I get it.

19:30.821 --> 19:34.347
Change is scary, but Gretch
has laid a killer foundation

19:34.390 --> 19:35.913
and I'm gonna take you
to the next level.

19:35.957 --> 19:37.219
Psh. How?

19:37.263 --> 19:39.047
Let's not get into specifics
right now...

19:39.090 --> 19:40.309
Vice, Complex,and The Source

19:40.353 --> 19:42.006
are coming to town next week
to do a press tour

19:42.050 --> 19:44.008
to reinvigorate the brand. Plus,

19:44.052 --> 19:45.445
I've been talking
to a Swedish promoter,

19:45.488 --> 19:46.663
where you guys are very popular,

19:46.707 --> 19:48.404
and we're working up
a mini tour.

19:48.448 --> 19:52.321
If we avoid the windmill parts,
that could be cool.

19:52.365 --> 19:54.280
It's a great way to publicize
the new material.

19:54.323 --> 19:56.499
We don't have new material.

19:56.543 --> 19:58.066
What?

19:58.109 --> 19:59.415
Well, you're gonna need some.

19:59.459 --> 20:01.461
Chop, chop.

20:01.504 --> 20:02.244
That's one motivating bitch.

20:02.288 --> 20:04.290
-Yeah, she's good.
-Mm.

20:04.333 --> 20:06.292
-I'm Honey Nutz.
-Shut up.

20:06.335 --> 20:08.119
What was that?

20:08.163 --> 20:11.253
-How did you...
-This job is not that hard,
Gretch.

20:11.297 --> 20:13.603
It's just asking for things,
and I'm a really good asker.

20:13.647 --> 20:16.258
Because you have no shame.

20:16.302 --> 20:17.259
Exactly.

20:19.087 --> 20:22.656
Mmm.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.617
Mmm, what's going on with you?

20:27.661 --> 20:29.445
Why do I want to suck your dick?

20:29.489 --> 20:31.926
-No.

20:31.969 --> 20:33.928
Usually, this only happens
when I'm around

20:33.971 --> 20:37.323
someone who...

20:37.366 --> 20:39.629
Listen, apparently,
everyone already knows,

20:39.673 --> 20:41.196
and you're gonna
find out soon anyway,

20:41.240 --> 20:42.197
-so...
-PAUL: Jimmy,

20:42.241 --> 20:44.112
here's your dollar back.

20:44.155 --> 20:46.680
I broke your confidentiality.
I told Becca. I'm sorry.

20:46.723 --> 20:47.898
-Finding out

20:47.942 --> 20:49.204
when someone has money

20:49.248 --> 20:51.075
is the Cottumaccio superpower.

20:51.119 --> 20:54.949
Don't worry, I plan on reporting
myself to the FDIC.

20:54.992 --> 20:57.081
What money?
-Well, that's what

20:57.125 --> 20:58.561
-I want to talk to you about.
-I knew

20:58.605 --> 21:00.694
I wanted to suck your dick
for a reason.

21:00.737 --> 21:02.348
-Right here, babe.

21:02.391 --> 21:04.350
I'm eating
a secondhand cheese sammy.

21:04.393 --> 21:06.700
That's the least
that fink could give us.

21:06.743 --> 21:08.571
What the hell is going on?

21:08.615 --> 21:10.399
Jimmy's about to become
an angel investor

21:10.443 --> 21:13.184
-in my surgeries-in-a-food-truck
business.
-No!

21:13.228 --> 21:14.969
We need out of Lindsay's hovel.

21:15.012 --> 21:16.797
-You ruined a perfectly good...

21:25.414 --> 21:27.547
Oh, my God!

21:27.590 --> 21:28.461
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

21:28.504 --> 21:31.377
I was just worried
that it would change things.

21:31.420 --> 21:33.379
Jimmy,

21:33.422 --> 21:35.946
if I cared about money,
I would've married Ty

21:35.990 --> 21:40.386
or Chingy or any of the other
countless rich guys I've banged.

21:40.429 --> 21:43.258
I'm not horny for stuff, dummy.
Never have been.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.390
I'm just a bottomless pit

21:44.433 --> 21:46.827
of need for constant
male validation.

21:46.870 --> 21:48.742
-That's comforting.
-And, besides,

21:48.785 --> 21:50.787
you've already given me
the greatest gift in the world.

21:50.831 --> 21:53.399
-My love.
-You ate your come.

21:53.442 --> 21:57.577
Because I told you
it was important to me.

21:57.620 --> 21:59.840
And then you did it
a second time for some reason.

21:59.883 --> 22:02.582
-Stop.
-Well, you must've
really liked it.

22:02.625 --> 22:04.192
No, I... no, I didn't like it!

22:04.235 --> 22:06.281
Then why'd you gobble it all up?

22:06.325 --> 22:09.023
I was making sure it tasted
as weird as I thought it did.

22:10.981 --> 22:12.505
Aw...

22:30.566 --> 22:31.828
VERNON:
Jimmy, we've all been talking,

22:31.872 --> 22:33.613
and we're sorry
we all bum-rushed you for help.

22:33.656 --> 22:35.179
That wasn't fair.

22:35.223 --> 22:37.486
What's fair is giving each
of us $10,000

22:37.530 --> 22:38.879
-and calling it even.

22:38.922 --> 22:41.447
Just get your checkbook
and let's end the madness.

22:41.490 --> 22:43.231
The money's gone.

22:43.274 --> 22:46.016
What did she do with it?
What did you do with it?

22:46.060 --> 22:48.279
She didn't do anything. I did.

22:48.323 --> 22:50.325
I just paid off my mortgage.

22:53.502 --> 22:56.026
He did.

22:56.070 --> 22:59.290
I no longer wish to suck
the dick for money reasons.

22:59.334 --> 23:01.771
Ever since you got that check,

23:01.815 --> 23:03.904
you just think
you're so superior, huh?

23:03.947 --> 23:06.297
I've always thought
I was superior.

23:06.341 --> 23:08.299
Now, if you could
all please leave.

23:08.343 --> 23:10.127
What if I told you guys
about a business opportunity

23:10.171 --> 23:12.347
where people could get
outpatient medical care

23:12.391 --> 23:13.870
in a Korean food truck?

23:13.914 --> 23:15.481
I'm listening.

23:17.483 --> 23:18.701
You paid off the house?

23:18.745 --> 23:20.050
I did.

23:20.094 --> 23:22.488
For our future.

23:25.621 --> 23:27.623
Now, let's christen this bitch.

23:32.193 --> 23:34.151
Where is my car?

23:34.195 --> 23:37.459
How dare they leave someone
with full-blown polio.

23:37.503 --> 23:39.461
I canceled your Lyft.
