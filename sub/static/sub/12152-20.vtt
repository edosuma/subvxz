Never have gotten a clean shot.

16:34.333 --> 16:36.085
It's not like anything I've ever seen.

16:36.253 --> 16:39.051
Golden's brother used to soldier
in my crew back in the days.

16:39.213 --> 16:40.692
Then he broke off and went solo.

16:40.853 --> 16:43.083
Tommy was running our unit
when the sun went out.

16:43.253 --> 16:46.484
We stayed topside as long as we could,
tried to hold some ground...

16:46.893 --> 16:48.531
...but there were too many of them.

16:48.693 --> 16:51.571
We go out every day
to check the tracks...

16:53.133 --> 16:58.526
They're your crew, aren't they?
You're the leader.

16:58.693 --> 16:59.967
I'm Matthew.

17:02.613 --> 17:06.571
It's okay. All the other ways in

17:07.173 --> 17:08.652
We checked.

17:08.813 --> 17:11.281
Well, now I'm checking.

17:13.853 --> 17:15.491
He's so young.

17:15.653 --> 17:19.726
We found him in a pileup on La Brea.
Vamps laid tire traps on the road...

17:19.893 --> 17:22.123
...having themselves
a car-wreck picnic.

17:22.772 --> 17:24.411
He watched them murder his parents.

17:24.573 --> 17:26.689
They were coming after him
when we showed up.

17:31.053 --> 17:34.125
Matthew, you got any water
in this place?

17:34.293 --> 17:36.932
Yes. We tapped a clean water pipe
right over here.

17:42.533 --> 17:44.012
Anyway, I knew about this place.

17:44.173 --> 17:46.846
Used to crash up here nights
when the missions were full.

17:47.013 --> 17:50.483
So we hit a supermarket that hadn't
burnt down yet and got some supplies.

17:50.733 --> 17:52.928
We went under.
Been down here ever since.

17:53.093 --> 17:54.572
About two weeks and some change.

17:54.733 --> 17:56.405
No offense,
but two weeks here...

17:56.573 --> 17:58.689
...and I'd be ready to move back
with my mother.

17:58.853 --> 18:00.571
Yeah, well, we were holding our own.

18:00.733 --> 18:04.169
Occasional baddie looking for a place
to sleep. Nothing we couldn't handle.

18:04.333 --> 18:07.052
Till that thing out there
moved into our territory.

18:07.213 --> 18:09.169
It's been picking us off ever since.

18:09.653 --> 18:13.646
It got Tommy almost a week ago.
He was out resetting the traps.

18:21.413 --> 18:22.732
Whose blood is that?

18:24.453 --> 18:26.011
Somebody I knew.

18:31.733 --> 18:34.930
Somebody who tried
to do bad stuff to my friends.

18:38.653 --> 18:41.963
- I can't believe you stayed down here.
HOLLY: Worse up there, ain't it?

18:42.293 --> 18:45.729

Besides, whatever that evil son
of a bitch is, it killed our people...

18:51.013 --> 18:54.688
...it killed my brother.
We're going to kill him right back.

- Now it belongs to me.

19:41.093 --> 19:44.051

I'll bring them down, I promise.

Soon. Soon you'll go out
with all of my strength behind you.

very agreeable.

his administration tonight.

20:07.693 --> 20:12.289
Oh, it's happening.
Don't you feel it?

This world is about to kneel before me
and shed all its avarice, all its woe.

To belong,
to truly be a part of something...

to it completely.

32:04.893 --> 32:06.212
Eh?

32:06.373 --> 32:09.490
That's his name,
the one who attacked you.

32:10.173 --> 32:14.405
You creatures, throwing your names
all over all the time.

32:14.573 --> 32:17.770
That's why you are so weak.
Too many are knowing your names.

32:18.253 --> 32:20.164
Takes your power away.

32:20.333 --> 32:23.291
It doesn't work that way here.
With us...

32:27.533 --> 32:29.683
So that's the word, isn't it?

32:29.853 --> 32:32.731
- The word she gives care about.
- Shut.

32:32.893 --> 32:35.885
- It's her name.
- Shut, shut, shut!

32:37.693 --> 32:40.127
Shut, shut, shut!

32:51.013 --> 32:52.412
FRED:
Matthew.

32:54.173 --> 32:56.971
It's okay. We don't want to hurt you.
We just want to talk...

32:57.133 --> 32:58.646
...but it's not safe here.

32:59.333 --> 33:01.608
You didn't tell me the sun
came back out.

33:01.773 --> 33:04.765
Oh, yeah, forgot to tell you.
Sun came back out.

33:05.253 --> 33:07.687
Angel, he's a vampire,
like the ones who...

33:07.853 --> 33:10.845
We can't explain it up here,
but we're the good guys, I swear.

33:11.013 --> 33:12.924
- And we need you to come with us.
- No.

33:13.213 --> 33:16.205
- No, I won't go.
- Sorry, son, but we ain't asking.

33:16.373 --> 33:18.568
Help! Help!

33:19.893 --> 33:21.167
Fred.

33:22.973 --> 33:26.363
- Fred!
- What?

33:26.533 --> 33:28.285
Get his feet.

33:30.973 --> 33:35.330
She has a name, and it has power over
her. That's why she keeps it a secret.

33:35.533 --> 33:37.808
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la!
La, la, la, la!

33:37.973 --> 33:39.247
Not listening!

33:39.413 --> 33:42.689
And somehow, her true name prevents
her from choosing a false one...

33:42.853 --> 33:44.525
...so one of us had to do it.

33:48.973 --> 33:50.247
What it matters, eh?

33:50.413 --> 33:53.962
Eh, talky meat?
I no keep the name.

33:54.133 --> 33:56.886
High priest keep the name.

33:57.373 --> 34:00.251
And you about to go dead.

34:00.413 --> 34:03.644
About to be a smear
on my flesh spell.

34:04.733 --> 34:08.487
I just messenger
from the ones who love truly.

34:08.813 --> 34:12.692
Well, then, I guess it's time
to shoot the messenger.

34:13.092 --> 34:17.132
Or, you know, chop the messenger
into little, bitty pieces. Whatever.

34:21.853 --> 34:26.483
And that's why when we use
words like "ugly-ass" and "beastie"...

34:26.693 --> 34:29.206
...we can sometimes do more
damage than we intend to.

34:29.413 --> 34:34.009
It ain't all about sticks and stones,
my young friends. That's all.

34:34.373 --> 34:38.969
A little life lesson, one to grow on.
Knowing. Knowing is half...

34:39.132 --> 34:40.485

34:41.172 --> 34:42.492
HOLLY:
Matthew.

34:46.813 --> 34:49.771
GOLDEN: What the hell happened, man?
- He'll be okay.

34:51.533 --> 34:53.409
I'm sorry. We...
We had no other...

34:53.572 --> 34:55.688
- Fred.
- What is she talking about?

34:56.132 --> 34:58.727
- Nothing.
- I'm not liking what I'm not hearing.

34:58.893 --> 35:01.248
What did you do to my boy?

35:01.453 --> 35:03.569
There's a new world
of bad going on upstairs...

35:03.733 --> 35:05.689
...and your boy was walking
into it blind.

35:05.853 --> 35:08.128
We did what we had to,
and I ain't interested...

35:08.293 --> 35:10.409
...in your opinion on the subject.

35:10.613 --> 35:12.604
[LAUGHING]

35:14.493 --> 35:15.767

35:20.733 --> 35:23.406
I see you.

35:23.933 --> 35:26.811
Holly, look what they did
to Matthew.

35:26.973 --> 35:30.124
They hit him again and again
until he lost all consciousness.

35:31.613 --> 35:35.242
- He just wanted to see the sun.
- Fred, Lorne, it's time to go.

35:35.493 --> 35:39.486
Golden, my love,
don't you want to hit them?

35:39.653 --> 35:42.451
Don't you want to kill them?

35:42.613 --> 35:46.526
You know, that just might
make my whole damn day.

35:46.693 --> 35:48.490

They always soft inside.

36:30.173 --> 36:32.289

36:34.773 --> 36:36.650
Time to go dead, mouse.

36:57.493 --> 37:01.486
...I give unto thee.

37:04.093 --> 37:07.722
That creature, he came from a world
that's worshipped Jasmine for millennia.

37:07.893 --> 37:11.806
- A world that we can reach through this.
- What?

37:13.173 --> 37:16.483
I think the universe just handed us
our first break.

37:17.053 --> 37:18.486
LORNE:
I really hate today!

37:18.653 --> 37:21.486
More worried about tomorrow myself.
Come on!

37:21.813 --> 37:25.522
No inscriptions.
No markings of any kind.

37:25.893 --> 37:27.770
No moving parts, as far as I can tell.

37:27.933 --> 37:31.369
- So this high priest holds the true name.
- Exactly.

37:35.333 --> 37:37.801
What else do we know about him?

37:37.973 --> 37:40.567
I'm just guessing
that he's bigger and meaner...

37:40.733 --> 37:42.849
...than our big,
mean friend over there.

37:44.053 --> 37:46.965
Wouldn't surprise me.
What about...?

37:48.333 --> 37:50.449
Wes, something is going down.

37:50.773 --> 37:52.047
Something?

37:53.173 --> 37:55.289
Something bad.

- God, are we dead yet?

38:13.413 --> 38:14.812
ANGEL:
Guys!

38:18.773 --> 38:21.162
No words. No word magic.

38:21.893 --> 38:24.361
- Angel, it's Connor. He's here.
- I know.

38:24.533 --> 38:27.093
LORNE:
And the National Guard, I think.

38:29.373 --> 38:31.887
- No!
- No word magic. Powerless.

38:32.053 --> 38:34.169
Much more power...

38:34.813 --> 38:36.451
...in blood magic.

WESLEY:
Angel, I got it!

38:47.933 --> 38:51.369
- Okay, I'll hold it. You guys, get going.
- No, we can't go, only you.

38:51.533 --> 38:53.091
ANGEL:
What are you talking about?

38:54.413 --> 38:56.881
That thing's world,
the atmosphere will kill us.

38:58.253 --> 39:00.084
We can't help there.

39:00.253 --> 39:03.563
But someone who knows the truth
has to live through this.

39:03.733 --> 39:07.009
- Angel, that's you.
- I can't.

39:08.053 --> 39:10.726
Hearts get in the way, right?

39:17.733 --> 39:19.769
Angel, wait!

39:31.573 --> 39:34.292
- We can't hold it.
- Time for the big fight scene.
