WEBVTT

00:01.615 --> 00:03.715
Previously on Smash.

00:05.161 --> 00:08.661
It was idealistic the fact
that we could do this without a star.

00:09.494 --> 00:11.894
You know you can came back
to heaven on earth.

00:11.923 --> 00:13.443
But I'm a brighter star.

00:13.498 --> 00:14.713
Marilyn is not

00:14.714 --> 00:17.798
some sweet little game nails fantasy!

00:17.885 --> 00:20.485
You really are the straightest
chorus boy I've ever met.

00:20.505 --> 00:22.724
- You think I'm straight?
- You're not straight?

00:23.230 --> 00:25.849
- I did want to tell you...
- I'm fired.

00:25.972 --> 00:27.156
We're talking to
a new songwriter,

00:27.190 --> 00:30.242
and Tom and Julia
cannot know.

00:30.277 --> 00:33.646
♪ Come on and love me

00:33.680 --> 00:34.747
What was this?

00:34.781 --> 00:36.599
It's a dirty business.

00:39.703 --> 00:42.955
- Your first impression.
- Girl next door.

00:42.989 --> 00:45.341
Okay...

00:46.843 --> 00:48.461
Slut.

00:48.495 --> 00:49.661
What?

00:49.680 --> 00:51.464
You look great in both.

00:51.498 --> 00:53.499
What are all these things
you're doing today, anyway?

00:53.517 --> 00:55.184
Well, I can't just
sit around

00:55.218 --> 00:56.969
and wait for Marilyn to happen,
so I have that audition,

00:57.003 --> 00:59.138
and then I'm gonna go by Orlin
to see if I can

00:59.172 --> 01:00.839
pick up some shifts
from Lianne.

01:00.857 --> 01:02.308
Hard-working girl...

01:09.366 --> 01:11.283
Where are you going?

01:11.318 --> 01:14.153
I have an audition.

01:14.187 --> 01:16.238
It's ready.

01:19.042 --> 01:21.510
Sorry, dad.

01:21.545 --> 01:24.330
Sorry.
So sorry.

01:24.364 --> 01:26.832
Julia, the adoption papers,
where are they?

01:26.866 --> 01:28.968
By the bed. Love you.
Bye.

01:29.002 --> 01:31.837
I've called, emailed,
texted Ivy.

01:31.871 --> 01:33.055
Nothing.

01:33.090 --> 01:34.540
I'm sure she's fine.

01:34.558 --> 01:38.060
Sometimes people need
to be by themselves.

01:38.095 --> 01:40.379
You have to rush?

01:40.397 --> 01:42.148
I'm sorry, I do.

01:42.182 --> 01:44.483
I've got a full morning
of case work,

01:44.518 --> 01:46.519
and then I've got court
this afternoon.

01:46.553 --> 01:48.854
- How 'bout tonight?
- Still working.

01:48.888 --> 01:51.857
Tomorrow night's
no good for me.

01:51.891 --> 01:53.359
Thursday night.

01:53.393 --> 01:56.746
Well, I'm
getting together with a friend.

01:56.780 --> 01:58.564
A friend?

02:00.784 --> 02:02.418
I'm going to a benefit
for a friend.

02:02.452 --> 02:04.570
- It's a friend from college.
- Great. Can I come?

02:04.588 --> 02:07.590
It's not your kind of thing.
It's political.

02:07.624 --> 02:09.375
But you came to my workshop,

02:09.408 --> 02:10.876
and I'm excellent
arm candy.

02:10.910 --> 02:12.711
I... I can look
very dashing.

02:12.745 --> 02:14.930
And the things
those Republicans are doing,

02:14.965 --> 02:16.599
I mean,
it's just despicable.

02:16.633 --> 02:17.933
Especially with the arts.

02:17.968 --> 02:19.935
It's a republican
fundraiser.

02:23.774 --> 02:26.675
You mean...

02:26.710 --> 02:28.811
I'm a republican.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:55.622 --> 02:58.057
And I have all these
back problems

02:58.091 --> 02:59.475
because I'm getting old,
you know.

02:59.509 --> 03:01.310
Or your chiropractor isn't

03:01.344 --> 03:02.561
as good as you think.

03:02.596 --> 03:04.163
My guy is amazing.

03:04.197 --> 03:05.898
I'll get you his number.

03:05.932 --> 03:08.100
Or your back
doesn't hurt

03:08.134 --> 03:10.319
because you're on
so many drugs.

03:10.353 --> 03:11.637
What is all this?

03:11.655 --> 03:13.639
When I started
the prednisone,

03:13.657 --> 03:15.774
I couldn't sleep, so my doctor
put me on Ambien.

03:15.808 --> 03:17.743
Plus the Klonopin
for the anxiety.

03:17.777 --> 03:19.445
But then I was
totally doped up,

03:19.479 --> 03:20.979
so then he put me
on Lorazepam and...

03:20.997 --> 03:23.833
I don't know,
some new stuff.

03:23.867 --> 03:26.919
And stuff?

03:26.953 --> 03:28.820
Don't you judge me.

03:28.839 --> 03:31.173
Listen, I've been
pretty anxious lately,

03:31.208 --> 03:32.825
and not without good reason.

03:32.859 --> 03:35.494
I worked my ass off
on that workshop.

03:35.512 --> 03:38.043
And now I'm back in Heaven
on earth for...

03:38.044 --> 03:39.632
- probably forever.
- Ivy.

03:39.666 --> 03:42.101
I'm not judging, okay?
Just...

03:42.135 --> 03:43.502
Just be careful.

03:47.006 --> 03:49.892
Here's his number.

03:52.312 --> 03:53.946
Anna Paquin...

03:53.980 --> 03:57.700
Chelsea Wood, Anna Faris,
Rebecca Duvall...

03:57.734 --> 03:59.985
Kate Winslet.

04:00.019 --> 04:02.788
I'm hearing a lot
of pipe dreams. Kate Winslet?

04:02.822 --> 04:04.623
You never know
until you try.

04:04.658 --> 04:06.292
That's sweet.

04:06.326 --> 04:07.810
What, you're a producer
now, Ellis?

04:07.844 --> 04:09.495
If you're going
for a star,

04:09.529 --> 04:11.030
it's part of the process,
Derek.

04:11.064 --> 04:12.831
Yeah, well, as we all know,
going for a star

04:12.865 --> 04:14.717
isn't the first thing
I'd do to save this.

04:14.751 --> 04:17.202
Me neither.
I hate chasing movie stars.

04:17.220 --> 04:19.338
Good, so there's
actually one thing

04:19.372 --> 04:20.805
you can all agree on.

04:20.839 --> 04:24.727
Derek, we have a meeting
at CAA in 20 minutes.

04:24.761 --> 04:25.995
- Tom, Julia...
- What?

04:26.029 --> 04:27.396
That title.

04:27.430 --> 04:29.765
Okay.

04:36.022 --> 04:37.690
All right, what's the problem?
What is the problem?

04:37.724 --> 04:39.909
The problem is
what it's always been...

04:39.943 --> 04:41.527
The show isn't ready.

04:41.561 --> 04:43.412
Derek, you had a fight
with your collaborators

04:43.446 --> 04:45.164
and you lost...
Get over it.

04:45.198 --> 04:47.583
What I had was
a perfectly good idea

04:47.617 --> 04:48.934
for the development
of this musical,

04:48.969 --> 04:50.553
which they didn't like...
Fair enough.

04:50.587 --> 04:52.571
But I'm gonna need one
or two things in return.

04:52.589 --> 04:54.256
Such as?

04:54.291 --> 04:57.209
I'm not chasing stars
until I see a finished script.

04:57.243 --> 04:59.929
In fact, you know what,
I'm not going to do anything

04:59.963 --> 05:01.213
until I see
a finished script.

05:01.247 --> 05:02.715
And when I see
a finished script,

05:02.749 --> 05:04.883
I will agree
to give notes.

05:04.917 --> 05:07.019
And then in one year
we'll do a second workshop.

05:07.053 --> 05:08.754
In a year?

05:08.772 --> 05:10.222
I've got people
chasing me, Eileen.

05:10.257 --> 05:11.223
I'm not gonna just
sit around

05:11.258 --> 05:12.758
and hope for the best.

05:12.776 --> 05:14.209
Whether or not
you're willing to admit it,

05:14.244 --> 05:16.895
Tom and Julia need
the time.

05:29.893 --> 05:31.627
- Ellis...
- Yes?

05:31.661 --> 05:34.263
Get me Doug Hughes.

05:34.297 --> 05:35.814
The director?

05:35.849 --> 05:37.750
Yes, the director.

05:44.341 --> 05:45.975
Hi.

05:46.009 --> 05:48.594
Hi, I'm Ivy Lynn.

05:48.628 --> 05:51.063
- You were booked for 10:00.
- I know. I'm sorry.

05:51.097 --> 05:53.482
I... I got stuck in the subway.
Are they still going?

05:53.516 --> 05:54.733
Yes, but they're
finishing up.

05:54.768 --> 05:56.735
Okay, thank you.

05:56.770 --> 05:59.471
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:59.489 --> 06:00.606
We just keep running
into each other, don't we?

06:00.640 --> 06:02.274
Yeah, we really do.

06:02.308 --> 06:03.609
Break a leg.

06:03.643 --> 06:06.645
She was perfect.

06:14.821 --> 06:17.321
SMASH
S01 Ep09 - Hell on Earth

06:18.090 --> 06:21.590
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

06:26.142 --> 06:28.108
I tell people you cannot cover
chefs and maybe in a few weeks

06:28.109 --> 06:29.927
you can ask him to put you
on the schedule officially.

06:29.928 --> 06:30.577
Perfect.

06:31.123 --> 06:32.724
What happened
with the Marilyn workshop?

06:32.758 --> 06:35.426
You know,
it's sort of... I don't know.

06:36.075 --> 06:37.204
In that "nothing's happening",

06:37.205 --> 06:38.877
"but anything could
happen" kind of place?

06:38.971 --> 06:40.221
Exactly.

06:40.256 --> 06:41.289
Sometimes they stay there
forever.

06:41.307 --> 06:43.758
I'm sorry.

06:43.792 --> 06:47.628
Hello? What?

06:47.646 --> 06:50.815
Yes.

06:50.850 --> 06:52.967
Okay!

06:52.985 --> 06:55.270
Okay. Okay.

06:55.304 --> 06:58.273
I... I got it.

06:58.307 --> 06:59.908
I got it.
My God!

06:59.942 --> 07:01.976
- My God, that's great!
- Yes!

07:01.994 --> 07:05.980
- Wait, what did you get?
- An orange juice commercial.

07:05.998 --> 07:08.750
Good for you!

07:08.784 --> 07:12.303
My gosh.
I've gotta go call Dev!

07:12.338 --> 07:14.189
Deal breaker.

07:14.223 --> 07:16.624
Marilyn played fast and loose
with her contacts,

07:16.658 --> 07:18.927
but that's not really
a good title, Tom.

07:18.961 --> 07:22.997
No, I mean John is a republican.
That's a deal breaker.

07:23.015 --> 07:27.802
American star.
American icon.

07:27.836 --> 07:28.853
Yech! Eww!

07:28.888 --> 07:31.172
Yeah, that's bad.

07:31.190 --> 07:32.506
I should have known.

07:32.525 --> 07:34.359
The suits.
The closely cropped hair.

07:34.393 --> 07:37.345
- He's pretty dreamy.
- I know!

07:37.363 --> 07:39.030
You're being too hard
on him.

07:39.064 --> 07:40.514
I thought you weren't
that political.

07:40.533 --> 07:42.350
I thought you were.

07:42.368 --> 07:44.018
Everyone has their faults.

07:44.036 --> 07:48.456
You should give him
a chance.

07:50.692 --> 07:52.193
Have you heard
from Michael?

07:52.211 --> 07:55.980
No.
That's over, thank God.

07:56.015 --> 07:57.649
I don't know
what I was thinking.

07:57.683 --> 07:59.117
Did you ever talk
to Leo about it?

07:59.151 --> 08:00.501
Are you kidding?

08:00.535 --> 08:02.703
We both avoided it
like the plague.

08:02.721 --> 08:04.472
I just thank God
every day

08:04.506 --> 08:07.508
that that insanity
is over.

Eileen's pretty mad
I dumped her for Jerry.

09:41.203 --> 09:43.321
If she walks in here
and finds me,

09:43.355 --> 09:44.638
you know she'll kill us both.

09:52.647 --> 09:54.315
Think she works for Madonna now.

09:54.333 --> 09:58.152
They're not looking
at Madonna.

Mimi Brownstein.

09:59.838 --> 10:01.289
I think she's a WME.

10:01.323 --> 10:04.025
She can walk you through

11:26.708 --> 11:28.075
I knew enough to get the kid
out of the house

11:28.093 --> 11:29.544
so I could find out.

Yes.

11:55.637 --> 11:58.157
It was Michael, wasn't it?

12:03.078 --> 12:07.131
I thought when I saw you two
at the workshop,

12:07.166 --> 12:08.966
but I then I thought,
God, no, she wouldn't.

12:09.001 --> 12:12.253
She wouldn't.
That's just not... even...

12:12.287 --> 12:14.472
Possible.
That's what I thought.

12:14.506 --> 12:16.790
- It wasn't anything.
- Julia, please don't.

12:16.809 --> 12:19.060
I don't wanna hear all the
stupid things that people say

12:19.094 --> 12:20.294
at moments like this.

12:20.312 --> 12:21.813
It was something!

12:21.847 --> 12:27.268
It was total betrayal of me
and Leo and...

12:27.302 --> 12:29.487
18 years of marriage!

12:29.521 --> 12:31.805
It was a betrayal
of everything.

12:31.824 --> 12:34.492
Do not tell me
it wasn't anything.

12:34.526 --> 12:36.143
That is just... that is disgusting
that you would say that.

12:36.161 --> 12:38.579
- That's disgusting.
- I'm sorry.

12:38.614 --> 12:39.947
I mean it.
I'm so, so sorry.

12:39.981 --> 12:42.116
Sorry is so...
Sorry is not good enough.

12:42.150 --> 12:43.784
Frank, I don't know
what else to say.

12:43.818 --> 12:45.503
I didn't want it to happen.
It was an accident.

12:45.537 --> 12:47.505
- It happened.
- An accident.

12:47.539 --> 12:48.673
Please, I don't know
how to talk about this.

12:48.707 --> 12:50.291
- Neither do I.
- Okay, okay.

12:50.325 --> 12:52.710
What...
Okay, okay.

13:22.425 --> 13:24.393
- Here. Come on in.
- This is so weird.

13:24.427 --> 13:26.095
You'll get used to it.
It's fine.

13:26.129 --> 13:27.596
Jason.
Jason, I got Karen.

13:27.630 --> 13:29.315
Hi, Karen, hi.
You look fantastic.

13:29.349 --> 13:30.733
Really?
I feel like a frog.

13:30.767 --> 13:32.568
Let's get started.
First line.

13:32.602 --> 13:34.970
Okay, "you have a lot
of choices in the morning"

13:34.988 --> 13:38.473
from what...
From what you're gonna wear."

13:38.491 --> 13:41.327
- There is your closet.
- Okay. It's empty.

13:41.361 --> 13:42.745
The clothes appear
and disappear.

13:42.779 --> 13:44.980
We CGI that.
Lots of choices.

13:44.998 --> 13:46.782
Y-y-you're overwhelmed
by your choices.

13:46.816 --> 13:48.751
- You turn away from the closet.
- This way?

13:48.785 --> 13:51.837
To the mirror,
and say...

13:51.872 --> 13:53.839
"To how you'll wear
your hair."

13:53.874 --> 13:56.175
Pigtails, ponytail,
pixie.

13:56.209 --> 13:58.327
- Okay, so you CGI.
- Yeah, we CGI that on you.

13:58.345 --> 14:00.179
So you're watching yourself in
the mirror for how many seconds?

14:00.213 --> 14:01.597
- Six seconds.
- Six seconds

14:01.631 --> 14:03.132
- while that happens.
- Okay, follow me.

14:03.166 --> 14:05.667
- No, right now.
- Then your line.

14:05.685 --> 14:08.304
"So it's nice
when there's no choice."

14:08.338 --> 14:10.472
And you go to the refrigerator
and open it.

14:10.506 --> 14:12.674
- This side.
- Right.

14:12.692 --> 14:14.643
Where there's just one carton
of orange juice.

14:14.677 --> 14:15.978
It's the only thing
you keep in your fridge

14:16.012 --> 14:17.679
- because you love it so much.
- Okay.

14:17.697 --> 14:20.015
And then you pour.

14:20.033 --> 14:23.352
Pouring.

14:25.555 --> 14:27.356
And your line.

14:27.374 --> 14:28.857
"Start your day
with morning Ray OJ

14:28.875 --> 14:29.858
and let everything else
fall into place."

14:29.876 --> 14:32.661
Sunglasses.

14:35.715 --> 14:37.299
Perfect!
You got that?

14:37.334 --> 14:38.834
Yeah.
It doesn't seem too hard.

14:38.868 --> 14:41.670
Just wait till you've done it
200 times.

14:43.056 --> 14:45.557
Don't drink that...

14:51.731 --> 14:54.383
It's your 15th shot
here, though, right?

14:54.401 --> 14:55.684
Michael!

14:55.718 --> 14:57.552
Frank, hey.

14:57.570 --> 15:00.656
I'll see you guys.

15:00.690 --> 15:03.725
No, Julia's not here.
She's at home with Leo.

15:03.743 --> 15:07.496
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

15:07.530 --> 15:10.532
Well,
It's great to see you.

15:10.566 --> 15:11.750
- Hold on.
- Frank.

15:11.785 --> 15:13.002
Hang on.

15:13.036 --> 15:14.920
I just wanna talk.

15:14.955 --> 15:17.239
I just wanna talk.

15:17.257 --> 15:18.424
Go home, Frank.

15:18.458 --> 15:20.376
That's actually...
Yeah.

15:20.410 --> 15:22.378
That's not so easy
to do any more, is it?

15:22.412 --> 15:23.745
It is.

15:23.763 --> 15:26.715
Go home.
Julia's waiting for you.

15:26.749 --> 15:28.100
You are not allowed
to tell me

15:28.134 --> 15:29.418
about my wife
and what she's doing.

15:29.436 --> 15:30.602
I'm not.

15:30.637 --> 15:32.388
You came into my house,

15:32.422 --> 15:33.922
you had dinner with my wife
and my son

15:33.940 --> 15:35.557
and then you slept
with my wife.

15:35.591 --> 15:37.526
- Okay.
- You came into my house!

15:37.560 --> 15:41.063
- Into 18 years of marriage.
- This is not the time or place.

15:41.097 --> 15:43.265
And you took everything
from me!

15:43.283 --> 15:45.434
- You took everything.
- Frank, listen to me.

15:45.452 --> 15:47.069
It was over a long time ago.

15:47.103 --> 15:48.287
It should never have
started up again,

15:48.321 --> 15:49.788
and that's on me.

15:49.823 --> 15:52.041
But don't make this
more than it is.

15:52.075 --> 15:55.627
It was over a long time ago.

16:00.967 --> 16:03.452
A long time ago?

16:18.802 --> 16:20.402
So what do you think?

16:20.437 --> 16:22.071
She has been looking for a way
to redefine herself.

16:22.105 --> 16:24.273
- This could be it.
- She loves musicals.

16:24.307 --> 16:25.641
Just once you get
on that movie train,

16:25.675 --> 16:28.077
it's hard to get off.

16:28.111 --> 16:30.162
You said it's the Rands
producing?

16:30.196 --> 16:32.331
Eileen Rand.
They split up.

16:32.365 --> 16:34.616
- Who has the money?
- She does.

16:34.650 --> 16:38.287
So what would you need
to get her to do this?

16:38.321 --> 16:42.458
Well, all the people involved
are top shelf.

16:42.492 --> 16:46.361
But do you have any material...
Script, music?

16:46.396 --> 16:49.465
I could come up
with something.

16:51.017 --> 16:54.186
I am glad that we reconnected
like this.

16:54.220 --> 16:57.005
Yeah.

16:57.023 --> 17:00.692
Where did we meet again?

17:00.727 --> 17:03.178
I thought Derek Wills
was your guy on this.

17:03.196 --> 17:05.364
Well, yes, he directed
the workshop,

17:05.397 --> 17:07.449
but, oh, there was
so much tension.

17:07.483 --> 17:08.867
I'm stunned to hear it.

17:08.902 --> 17:10.435
No one could believe

17:10.470 --> 17:11.787
you got Tom and Derek
to speak to each other,

17:11.820 --> 17:14.656
let alone work together again.

17:14.690 --> 17:16.458
Maybe it was a little
premature.

17:16.492 --> 17:20.395
But not to be coy, if we were
looking for a new director,

17:20.430 --> 17:22.131
what do you think of Marilyn?

17:22.165 --> 17:24.316
She was a fantastic creature,

17:24.349 --> 17:27.301
and it's a brilliant idea
to make a musical about her.

17:27.337 --> 17:29.871
I'd love to see
what Tom and Julia came up with.

17:29.889 --> 17:32.057
They're brilliant songwriters.

17:32.092 --> 17:34.560
- Yes, they are, actually.
- Hello, hello!

17:34.594 --> 17:36.211
Michael Riedel.

17:36.229 --> 17:39.714
You're looking stunning,
Eileen, as usual.

17:39.732 --> 17:41.683
- Thank you, darling.
- Doug, good to see you.

17:41.717 --> 17:43.152
Great to see you too,
Michael.

17:43.186 --> 17:44.703
What are you two
conspiring about?

17:44.737 --> 17:47.039
We're just having
a little dinner.

17:47.073 --> 17:49.158
I don't wanna read about us
in your column, Michael.

17:49.192 --> 17:51.743
Of course not.

17:53.613 --> 17:56.398
Now, where were we?

17:57.917 --> 17:59.902
Okay, shh, shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh!

17:59.936 --> 18:01.903
To Heaven on Earth.

18:01.921 --> 18:04.206
Who said you can't
go home again?

18:04.240 --> 18:05.574
Cheers.

18:05.592 --> 18:06.708
Cheers.

18:11.247 --> 18:12.764
I'll be right back,
you guys.

18:12.799 --> 18:14.749
Did you see my little
cross-step for you?

18:14.767 --> 18:16.751
It was a gift.
No, I didn't.

18:16.769 --> 18:18.587
How are you?

18:18.605 --> 18:20.922
I'm good.
I'm glad you came.

18:20.940 --> 18:23.692
Well, thanks for the call.

18:23.726 --> 18:25.611
How is she?

18:25.645 --> 18:28.430
Why don't you ask her
yourself?

18:28.448 --> 18:30.599
Last time I saw her,
I broke her heart.

18:30.617 --> 18:32.734
She must hate me.
I hate me.

18:32.768 --> 18:34.403
She doesn't hate you.

18:34.437 --> 18:37.206
Let me get a drink,
then I'll go say hi.

18:37.240 --> 18:39.258
Good plan.
Two beers?

18:39.292 --> 18:42.077
I'd like a glass of wine.

18:42.111 --> 18:43.679
A Sauvignon Blanc.

18:45.448 --> 18:47.583
What, he's gonna
ignore me now?

18:47.617 --> 18:49.951
- That's classic.
- He'll come over.

18:49.969 --> 18:52.471
You know Tom.
He's just being sensitive.

18:52.505 --> 18:54.423
He wasn't so sensitive
he couldn't fire me.

18:54.457 --> 18:56.558
Chasing
after movie stars.

18:56.593 --> 18:57.759
That's so lame.

18:57.794 --> 18:58.960
It's a musical.

18:58.978 --> 19:00.962
It's a new American musical.

19:00.980 --> 19:02.314
Why can't the song
be the star?

19:02.348 --> 19:03.765
Why can't I be the star?

19:05.018 --> 19:06.902
Did you guys hear
about Karen?

19:06.936 --> 19:09.971
She booked a national commercial
for orange juice.

19:09.989 --> 19:11.990
How does she do that?

19:12.025 --> 19:15.410
She just walks into this city
with that midwestern moon face

19:15.445 --> 19:17.279
and lands everything.

19:17.313 --> 19:20.849
- She didn't land Marilyn.
- Neither did I.

19:22.818 --> 19:25.120
I'm sorry.

19:25.154 --> 19:27.623
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, you guys.

19:27.657 --> 19:30.259
Ivy.

19:30.293 --> 19:31.460
I forgot.

19:31.494 --> 19:33.712
You are in
so much trouble!

19:36.165 --> 19:38.467
All right.

19:38.501 --> 19:41.136
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:42.855 --> 19:45.357
That went well.

19:45.391 --> 19:47.842
Yeah.

19:47.860 --> 19:50.445
I'm so sick of that chick!

19:50.480 --> 19:51.863
I can't even have a drink
with my friends

19:51.898 --> 19:54.116
without her name coming up.

19:54.150 --> 19:56.184
Yeah, well, you know.

19:56.202 --> 19:59.154
New York can be
a pretty small town.

19:59.188 --> 20:00.489
Yes, I'm well aware.

20:00.523 --> 20:02.524
Nevertheless,
it is galling.

20:02.542 --> 20:04.626
And I'm so serious
about this.

20:04.661 --> 20:07.846
To be competing with someone
with so little experience.

20:07.880 --> 20:10.282
There's no logic
to show business, you know that.

20:10.316 --> 20:11.800
Yes, I know that.

20:11.834 --> 20:13.051
But does that mean
I'm supposed to like it?

20:13.086 --> 20:14.553
That's the world we live in.

20:14.587 --> 20:16.888
It doesn't matter
if you like it or not.

20:16.923 --> 20:19.374
That's helpful.

20:19.392 --> 20:20.809
Thanks, Derek.

20:20.843 --> 20:22.177
Thank you so much
for you support.

20:22.211 --> 20:25.314
- I really appreciate it.
- Okay, good.

20:25.348 --> 20:28.483
- What are you reading?
- It's a TV pilot.

20:28.518 --> 20:33.488
A JD / MBA / Ph.D
who solves crimes.

20:33.523 --> 20:35.907
It's riveting.

20:35.942 --> 20:38.193
Is there a part in it for me?

20:38.227 --> 20:40.862
How's your "dead hooker"?

20:43.916 --> 20:45.066
Very nice.

20:45.084 --> 20:47.002
It was a little expensive,

20:47.036 --> 20:48.537
but Jessica says you need
to look like, you know,

20:48.571 --> 20:50.355
- you're successful.
- You are successful.

20:50.390 --> 20:52.040
You just did
a national commercial.

20:52.074 --> 20:53.542
I did.

20:53.576 --> 20:55.577
You buy yourself
new sunglasses too?

20:55.595 --> 20:56.762
No.

20:56.796 --> 20:59.748
Marc Jacobs.
Very nice.

20:59.766 --> 21:03.852
No.
They're Ivy's.

21:03.886 --> 21:06.254
Sorry?

21:06.272 --> 21:08.223
I'm sorry, what?

21:08.257 --> 21:11.393
No, I haven't read the post.

21:12.395 --> 21:14.065
Yeah, okay.

21:16.599 --> 21:19.067
Riedel said what?

21:19.101 --> 21:21.603
Just read it to me then.

21:30.163 --> 21:34.449
Yeah, okay, fine.

21:34.467 --> 21:37.753
Let's just stick
to the plan, all right?

21:48.884 --> 21:50.884
- Eileen!
- You just can't go in there.

21:50.982 --> 21:53.350
- The hell I can't.
- Derek... excuse me!

21:54.209 --> 21:55.993
Sorry! He just barged in.

21:56.027 --> 21:57.328
Do you wanna call off
the chihuahua?

21:57.362 --> 21:58.963
It's fine, Ellis.

21:58.997 --> 22:01.132
You're not replacing me
with Doug Hughes.

22:01.166 --> 22:03.367
You can't believe everything
you read in Riedel's column.

22:03.385 --> 22:05.536
You know that.
He extrapolates.

22:05.554 --> 22:07.371
Besides which,
Doug and I are very old friends,

22:07.389 --> 22:09.507
and we were having a perfectly
innocent dinner.

22:09.541 --> 22:11.842
The hell you were.
You're worse than Jerry.

22:11.876 --> 22:14.462
You go behind my back and put
an item in a gossip column.

22:14.496 --> 22:16.213
He bumped into us.

22:16.231 --> 22:18.983
Because he knew
you were there.

22:19.017 --> 22:23.738
Derek, I believe in Marilyn.
I believe in this team.

22:23.772 --> 22:26.223
I'm not apologizing to anyone.

22:26.241 --> 22:28.426
Now are you in
or you out?

22:29.561 --> 22:32.496
Fine.

22:32.531 --> 22:34.949
Get me a star!

22:45.410 --> 22:47.578
You okay, girl?

22:47.613 --> 22:50.080
Yeah, of course.

22:50.098 --> 22:53.184
- Just seem a little down.
- No.

22:53.218 --> 22:56.220
No, I'm fine.

22:56.254 --> 22:58.572
See you down there.

23:25.083 --> 23:26.417
- Songs.
- Perfect.

23:26.451 --> 23:27.718
She's doing a junket.

23:27.753 --> 23:29.253
Her flight lands
in a couple hours.

23:29.287 --> 23:31.789
I'll make sure she...
Gives it a listen.

23:31.807 --> 23:33.557
She's coming here?

23:33.592 --> 23:36.060
Yeah, I just wanted to make
sure the room was perfect.

23:36.094 --> 23:39.463
She's... particular
about certain things.

23:39.481 --> 23:41.098
Beautiful flowers.

23:41.132 --> 23:43.801
Yes, Rebecca likes
her flowers.

23:48.156 --> 23:51.108
What do I need to do to get
Marilyn to the top of her list?

23:51.143 --> 23:52.293
She'll give it her
full attention

23:52.327 --> 23:54.645
as she does all her projects.

23:54.663 --> 23:57.981
But I want you to really,
really feel

23:58.000 --> 24:02.152
you can get behind her
doing this.

24:02.170 --> 24:06.173
You said we had a few hours.

24:11.162 --> 24:14.215
I'm looking!

24:18.520 --> 24:20.354
Ivy? You in there?

24:20.389 --> 24:22.940
Ivy!

24:22.974 --> 24:25.976
Are you in there?

24:38.156 --> 24:41.459
Ivy?

24:41.493 --> 24:43.494
You're about to go on.

24:51.553 --> 24:55.205
Thank you.
Sorry.

24:55.223 --> 24:58.509
God.

24:58.543 --> 24:59.727
Hi.

25:01.045 --> 25:02.713
'Scuse me.

25:07.069 --> 25:09.052
There he is.

25:10.856 --> 25:13.858
- You came.
- You invited me.

25:13.892 --> 25:15.559
Well, I'm glad you came.

25:15.577 --> 25:16.660
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:20.198 --> 25:22.032
Wha...
This is new for me.

25:22.066 --> 25:23.868
I know.
I know.

25:23.902 --> 25:26.253
Come on, there's some people
I want you to meet.

25:28.924 --> 25:30.508
Hello.

And you think this'll
never happen to you?

28:30.223 --> 28:32.257
This was supposed to be
my time.

28:32.275 --> 28:35.093
It is your time.
You're on Broadway.

28:35.111 --> 28:36.528
You're Marilyn Monroe.

28:36.562 --> 28:38.096
I was Marilyn for,
like, five seconds.

28:38.114 --> 28:39.564
But I never even got to
do her even once,

28:39.598 --> 28:40.949
so maybe you should stop
complaining

28:40.984 --> 28:42.734
about how lousy your life is.

28:42.768 --> 28:44.769
You were weak!
You were naive!

28:44.787 --> 28:47.406
You didn't want it enough!
You didn't fight hard enough!

28:47.440 --> 28:50.208
You didn't put enough
on the line.

28:50.243 --> 28:51.793
Yeah, okay.

28:51.828 --> 28:53.745
I didn't sleep with Derek.
You're right.

28:53.779 --> 28:55.414
I didn't do that.

28:55.448 --> 28:57.549
But trust me, it wasn't
because he didn't ask.

28:57.583 --> 29:00.252
You weren't the first choice.

29:02.422 --> 29:03.839
Sorry.

29:05.341 --> 29:07.125
Please.

29:07.143 --> 29:10.595
My mother said worse things than
that regularly at Sunday dinner.

29:10.629 --> 29:13.648
School nights too.

29:13.683 --> 29:15.984
You really are naive.

29:16.019 --> 29:19.154
Ivy, where are you...

29:19.188 --> 29:21.490
Excuse me.
Ivy.

29:21.524 --> 29:22.958
It's important
that we're not

29:22.992 --> 29:25.110
just a minority
in our own party.

29:25.144 --> 29:27.946
We need to be actively
putting forward candidates

29:27.980 --> 29:29.147
for public office,

29:29.165 --> 29:31.616
and that's why I am proud...

29:31.650 --> 29:35.754
To introduce my friend
and ex-roommate...

29:35.788 --> 29:39.291
Gary Knowles,
the Republican candidate

29:39.325 --> 29:41.159
for the U.S. House
of Representatives,

29:41.177 --> 29:44.846
14th District.
Gary!

29:44.881 --> 29:46.131
Thanks.

29:47.683 --> 29:50.552
Neatest roommate I ever had.

29:56.893 --> 29:58.693
Dad's here.

29:58.728 --> 30:00.812
He's here?

30:00.846 --> 30:04.199
I talked to him, mom.
He told me that you told him.

30:04.233 --> 30:06.985
- What did he say?
- What do you think he said?

30:07.019 --> 30:09.488
Why did you tell him?
We were fine.

30:09.522 --> 30:11.990
I knew. You said it was done
and we were fine.

30:12.024 --> 30:13.158
It is done.
It's over.

30:13.192 --> 30:14.376
It'll never happen again.

30:14.410 --> 30:15.827
Too late, mom.
He's leaving.

30:15.861 --> 30:19.364
- What?
- He's packing up and leaving.

30:20.533 --> 30:22.033
Frank, no.

30:22.051 --> 30:23.868
No, come on.
Come on, don't.

30:23.886 --> 30:25.220
We're still a family.

30:25.254 --> 30:27.722
Okay, I made a terrible,
terrible mistake.

30:27.757 --> 30:30.375
But that doesn't mean that...
Frank, hold on a second!

30:30.393 --> 30:32.227
For heaven's sake!
Just stop it!

30:32.261 --> 30:33.845
We have to talk about this!

30:33.879 --> 30:36.348
Okay, let's talk.
Tell me the whole story.

30:36.382 --> 30:40.352
Tell me about when it started.
Tell me how long it went on.

30:40.386 --> 30:42.154
- I...
- Tell me about before!

30:42.188 --> 30:43.421
- Before?
- Yeah, before.

30:43.456 --> 30:46.391
About how it happened...
Before.

30:52.782 --> 30:54.732
Leo, your father and I
need some privacy.

30:54.750 --> 30:56.368
No, you don't get to decide
how this goes.

30:56.402 --> 30:59.538
Whatever you thought before
was wrong.

30:59.572 --> 31:02.040
You thought that this
would be okay.

31:02.074 --> 31:04.042
You thought that cheating
is nothing.

31:04.076 --> 31:05.577
You thought,
"he'll never find out."

31:05.595 --> 31:07.078
You thought,
"he'll forgive me."

31:07.096 --> 31:08.746
You thought,
"it doesn't mean anything."

31:08.764 --> 31:10.098
Don't... please don't tell me
what I think.

31:10.133 --> 31:11.249
And please, please,
please don't go.

31:11.267 --> 31:13.385
- We need...
- Don't go, dad.

31:13.419 --> 31:14.919
Please.

31:14.937 --> 31:16.938
Don't go!

31:28.100 --> 31:29.534
Sorry. I'm so sorry.
Can I steal him?

31:29.569 --> 31:30.702
Sorry.
Excuse me.

31:30.736 --> 31:33.071
- Sorry.
- What's going on?

31:33.105 --> 31:35.790
Ivy flubbed a number
at Heaven on earth.

31:35.825 --> 31:37.709
She had been drinking,
they think.

31:37.743 --> 31:39.077
I have to get down there.

31:39.111 --> 31:40.278
Some people wanted
their money back.

31:40.296 --> 31:41.779
They don't know
where Ivy is.

31:41.797 --> 31:44.449
- It's a mess.
- But they can handle it.

31:44.467 --> 31:46.084
Excuse me?

31:46.118 --> 31:48.553
I mean, you have people
who are handling it.

31:48.588 --> 31:52.224
It's not...
Yes, they can.

31:52.258 --> 31:55.293
- But Ivy...
- Ivy is an adult.

31:55.311 --> 31:59.631
You're turning her into a child
by always being there.

31:59.649 --> 32:01.433
You are right.
What can I say?

32:01.467 --> 32:03.318
You're right.

32:03.352 --> 32:06.304
And I like you so much, John.
And I don't like Republicans,

32:06.322 --> 32:08.106
but I do like you.
But I can't stay here.

32:08.140 --> 32:10.475
I do have to go
and take care of Ivy.

32:10.493 --> 32:12.410
I don't care
if I'm infantilizing her.

32:12.445 --> 32:13.912
It's just who I am.

32:13.946 --> 32:15.480
And I'm sorry,

32:15.498 --> 32:18.316
because I like you so much.

32:18.334 --> 32:20.252
I really, really do.

32:20.286 --> 32:21.953
Even though
I don't like Republicans.

32:21.987 --> 32:23.955
Sorry.
But I do like you.

32:23.989 --> 32:26.458
Sorry.

32:34.500 --> 32:35.850
Got any money?

32:35.885 --> 32:37.969
Yeah. Of course.

32:38.003 --> 32:40.972
Can I borrow a 20?

32:41.006 --> 32:43.358
Ivy, I'm not
giving you money.

32:43.392 --> 32:46.478
Look. You feel bad.

32:46.512 --> 32:50.515
You wanna be nice to me?

32:50.533 --> 32:53.969
- Sort of.
- Then give me a 20.

33:07.550 --> 33:09.367
Have you heard from her?

33:09.385 --> 33:11.536
She just texted me.

33:11.554 --> 33:14.539
She's okay,
she's with Karen.

33:14.557 --> 33:17.342
Karen?
She hates her.

33:17.376 --> 33:19.010
I didn't get into it.

33:19.044 --> 33:20.545
I think she just needs
some space.

33:20.563 --> 33:22.714
You know she's an adult.

33:22.732 --> 33:26.551
We should probably stop acting
like we're her parents.

33:28.688 --> 33:30.739
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

33:34.110 --> 33:37.228
What's so funny?

33:37.246 --> 33:39.164
"Start your day
with morning Ray OJ

33:39.198 --> 33:41.065
and let everything else
fall into place."

33:41.083 --> 33:42.567
What is that?

33:42.585 --> 33:44.586
That orange juice commercial
I shot.

33:44.620 --> 33:47.756
The one
you beat me out on?

33:47.790 --> 33:49.257
What was that line?

33:49.292 --> 33:50.908
"Start your day
with morning Ray OJ...

33:50.926 --> 33:53.244
And let everything else
fall into place."

33:54.747 --> 33:56.047
That's so stupid.

33:56.081 --> 33:58.082
God,
it was so stupid.

33:58.100 --> 34:00.918
- I love this guy.
- You do?

34:00.936 --> 34:02.604
Yeah, he's awesome.

34:02.638 --> 34:04.589
He has these little dolls
that dance on the keyboard.

34:04.607 --> 34:06.891
I see.
She likes the crazy people.

34:06.925 --> 34:08.592
Of course she does.

34:08.610 --> 34:10.362
Aren't they hilarious?

34:10.396 --> 34:12.929

No, I'm fine.

37:16.085 --> 37:19.621
I don't mind.

37:21.391 --> 37:25.627
We're not best friends
now, okay?

37:25.662 --> 37:28.380
- I know.
- Good.

37:37.223 --> 37:39.441
Night...

37:44.447 --> 37:47.332
God.
It's 5:00 A.M.

37:47.367 --> 37:49.167
I haven't been up all night

37:49.202 --> 37:53.372
since I camped out
for Rent tickets in 1996.

37:54.741 --> 37:56.558
I haven't been out all night

37:56.592 --> 38:00.379
since the bruins won
the Stanley Cup!

38:00.413 --> 38:02.047
What's a bruin?

38:02.081 --> 38:04.933
It is a bear.

38:07.770 --> 38:11.223
The animal.

38:11.257 --> 38:12.557
Let me.
I got it.

38:12.591 --> 38:14.426
Let me.

38:15.761 --> 38:17.595
Finally she texts me.

38:17.613 --> 38:22.600
I was beginning to think
she loved you more than me.

38:25.271 --> 38:28.790
- What is it?
- Not her.

38:28.825 --> 38:33.078
It's someone
I've been seeing.

38:33.112 --> 38:34.963
Seeing,

38:34.997 --> 38:37.615
Well, then maybe
we should go Dutch.

38:39.502 --> 38:43.672
I'm kidding.
It's on me.

38:45.341 --> 38:48.143
Someone you been seeing.

38:50.146 --> 38:52.814
So Derek never intended
to leave Marilyn.

38:52.849 --> 38:55.901
Wait.
Wait, he was moving on.

38:55.935 --> 38:58.804
And you let me be the one
to scare him back in line.

38:58.838 --> 39:01.440
You make it sound so devious.

39:01.474 --> 39:03.775
I'll let you get away with it
just this once, Eileen.

39:03.809 --> 39:06.862
- But you owe me dinner.
- Thanks, sweetheart.

39:08.498 --> 39:10.982
Ellis, would you cover
the office for me, please?

39:11.000 --> 39:12.634
I'm going out for a minute.

39:12.668 --> 39:15.454
I'd actually rather not
answer phones any more.

39:17.340 --> 39:18.790
Really?

39:18.824 --> 39:22.010
And what would you
rather do for me?

39:22.044 --> 39:23.428
Coproducing.

39:23.463 --> 39:25.330
That's cheeky.

39:25.348 --> 39:26.765
I've been talking
to her manager.

39:26.799 --> 39:29.351
Rebecca Duvall
wants to play Marilyn.

39:29.385 --> 39:31.836
We spoke to CAA earlier
in the week,

39:31.854 --> 39:33.638
and, uh,
she's unavailable.

39:33.672 --> 39:36.508
Her agents are going to call
you on this phone in one minute,

39:36.526 --> 39:39.795
and if we land her,
I want a coproducing credit.

39:42.698 --> 39:45.285
She's early.

39:47.320 --> 39:49.955
Are you gonna negotiate
her contract?

39:49.989 --> 39:52.824
Are you going to sell her
to the investors?

39:52.859 --> 39:55.994
Are you going to address
her creative concerns?

39:56.028 --> 39:59.364
You know, there's more to
producing than casting, Ellis.

39:59.382 --> 40:01.500
And we're not going
to begin the process

40:01.534 --> 40:04.402
until you answer that phone.

40:08.891 --> 40:11.726
Eileen Rand's office.

40:14.013 --> 40:16.398
CAA on one.

40:22.271 --> 40:24.389
Michael.

40:24.407 --> 40:26.491
What...

40:26.526 --> 40:27.993
Thanks for meeting me.

40:28.027 --> 40:29.694
Out here?

40:31.914 --> 40:34.699
What happened to your face?

40:34.733 --> 40:36.418
You didn't hear?

40:36.452 --> 40:38.920
Frank threw a punch at me.

40:40.573 --> 40:43.091
Well, he didn't
just throw it.

40:43.125 --> 40:45.544
No.

40:49.599 --> 40:52.083
Is your family okay?

40:52.101 --> 40:54.052
Your wife, does she...

40:54.086 --> 40:57.239
She... she doesn't know.

40:57.273 --> 41:00.976
That's good.

41:03.646 --> 41:07.365
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize to me.

41:07.400 --> 41:08.600
It was me.
I...

41:08.618 --> 41:10.535
No, I shouldn't have...

41:10.570 --> 41:12.103
- I shouldn't have...
- I'm serious.

41:12.121 --> 41:14.939
Don't apologize.

41:14.957 --> 41:18.543
What we did,
we did together.

41:18.578 --> 41:22.414
And it exploded my whole life.

41:22.448 --> 41:24.252
Like a bombshell.

41:27.286 --> 41:31.339
But I'm not letting anyone say
that it was not my fault.

42:04.373 --> 42:07.509
I like it.

42:07.543 --> 42:10.161
Did you hear me?

42:10.179 --> 42:11.849
I really like it.

42:14.884 --> 42:17.669
It's a good title.

42:17.703 --> 42:20.772
Bombshell.

42:20.806 --> 42:24.676
Bombshell.

42:24.710 --> 42:26.863
I like it.
