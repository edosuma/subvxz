00:19.000 --> 00:20.764
Merry Christmas!

00:21.360 --> 00:23.124
Donations, please!

00:24.160 --> 00:25.764
MAN: Hey, you guys
have a merry Christmas now.

00:25.840 --> 00:27.251
WOMAN: Same to you too.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.331
SANTA: Ho. Ho. Ho.

00:30.400 --> 00:31.561
SANTA: Merry Christmas!

00:31.640 --> 00:32.720
MAN: Merry Christmas, dude.

00:34.040 --> 00:35.201
Let's go.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.560
(SHOUTS) Merry Christmas!

00:41.960 --> 00:43.928
(SCREAMING)

00:44.120 --> 00:45.121
Whoo!

00:45.440 --> 00:46.771
Hey.

00:47.120 --> 00:48.565
Merry Christmas, dude.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.490
Ooh!

00:55.560 --> 00:57.961
My Little Princess MP3 player.

00:59.280 --> 01:00.770
Santa must've
found your list, Quinn.

01:00.840 --> 01:02.171
I'll take it.

01:02.560 --> 01:04.449
I can get 50 bucks
for it on eBay.

01:07.640 --> 01:08.801
(FAINT GROWLING)

01:11.360 --> 01:14.045
What was that?
I didn't hear anything.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.490
Ah! Dude.

01:16.960 --> 01:18.246
This is gonna be awesome.

01:19.320 --> 01:21.448
A snow globe.
Oh, yeah.

01:22.480 --> 01:23.891
(MUSIC TINKLING)

01:32.840 --> 01:34.569
Who says Santa can't fly?

01:36.560 --> 01:38.050
(LAUGHING)

01:40.000 --> 01:41.001
Boom!

01:41.120 --> 01:44.044
You've been naughty.

01:46.520 --> 01:48.761
What'd you do? Bust out
of that snow globe?

01:53.960 --> 01:55.530
(GROWLING)

01:56.600 --> 01:58.364
Run! Run!

02:00.120 --> 02:02.043
(SCREAMING)

02:09.600 --> 02:11.125
QUINN: No!

02:11.200 --> 02:12.201
Quinn!

02:12.280 --> 02:13.441
Quinn. Quinn!

02:15.480 --> 02:16.891
QUINN: What are you doing?

02:18.520 --> 02:19.726
Derek!

02:27.800 --> 02:29.689
(GROWLING)
(SCREAMING)

02:31.400 --> 02:32.561
No!

02:33.600 --> 02:34.931
No!

02:35.640 --> 02:36.971
(CRYING)

02:41.560 --> 02:43.767
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

02:44.960 --> 02:46.086
(ROARING)

02:51.200 --> 02:52.565
QUINN: Help me!

02:52.640 --> 02:54.608
Somebody get me out of here!

02:57.600 --> 03:00.080
What's going on?
No, no!

03:00.240 --> 03:01.605
No, help me!

03:03.480 --> 03:04.891
(SCREAMING) Derek!

04:19.680 --> 04:20.841
Verrat.

04:55.480 --> 04:56.481
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

04:56.560 --> 04:58.244
Sorry I'm late.

04:58.360 --> 04:59.805
There was an accident.

05:00.560 --> 05:01.846
Good to see you still alive.

05:02.280 --> 05:03.280
You, too.

05:04.640 --> 05:05.971
Which language shall we meet in?

05:06.400 --> 05:08.482
English should suit everyone.

05:08.560 --> 05:10.210
Good.

05:10.280 --> 05:11.691
Where's Breslau?

05:11.760 --> 05:13.808
Breslau is dead.
He betrayed us.

05:14.760 --> 05:17.923
We almost missed meeting
Sean Renard because of it.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.726
So you are the Royal bastard.

05:22.240 --> 05:23.765
Well, lam Royal,

05:24.960 --> 05:26.450
and I can be a bastard.

05:28.640 --> 05:29.687
I can be too.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.762
We have been here longer
than we should be.

05:33.920 --> 05:35.080
Let's get this meeting going.

05:36.640 --> 05:37.641
Good to meet someone

05:37.720 --> 05:39.529
who hates your family
as much as I do.

05:39.600 --> 05:40.567
Well, it's good to meet someone

05:40.640 --> 05:42.688
who's not afraid
to say that to my face.

05:47.760 --> 05:49.808
I must get back before
your cousin misses me.

05:51.280 --> 05:53.760
Be careful.
I'll try.

05:56.160 --> 05:57.446
Let's get started.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.284
You gonna come by
the shop today?

06:03.440 --> 06:05.044
Don't think so.

06:05.120 --> 06:07.168
I hope you don't
need me or anything.

06:07.240 --> 06:09.049
I mean, not that
I don't want to be needed.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.485
It's just, you know,

06:10.560 --> 06:12.449
I got a lot going on today.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.768
Gotta get those jobs out
before Christmas

06:15.840 --> 06:17.251
'cause, you know, clock repairs

06:17.320 --> 06:18.810
need to be timely.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.284
Is that a clock joke?

06:21.400 --> 06:22.401
Just a very tiny one.

06:23.240 --> 06:24.480
Sorry.

06:24.560 --> 06:26.085
I heard it secondhand.

06:26.480 --> 06:28.005
Yikes.

06:28.080 --> 06:30.003
I'm leaving before you
can think of any more.

06:31.560 --> 06:32.721
Bye.
Bye.

06:38.680 --> 06:39.681
(KNOCKING)

06:42.920 --> 06:44.126
Hurry, come in.

06:46.040 --> 06:47.405
She didn't see you, did she?

06:47.480 --> 06:48.561
No.
Okay, good.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.290
Where did you park?

06:50.360 --> 06:51.691
Down the street,
like you told me.

06:51.760 --> 06:53.808
Okay, hurry up. We don't
have a lot of time.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.284
MAN: He cannot be trusted.

06:57.360 --> 06:58.600
WOMAN: The king
is his father.

06:58.680 --> 07:00.842
Yes, and his mother
is a Hexenbiest.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.809
It is more important than ever

07:02.880 --> 07:04.211
that we coordinate our efforts,

07:04.280 --> 07:06.487
and that includes Sean Renard.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.925
His brother's assassination

07:08.000 --> 07:09.570
has put pressure on all of us.

07:09.640 --> 07:12.166
That is not a bad thing.
We were not doing enough.

07:12.280 --> 07:14.248
He should have been
eliminated a long time ago.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.926
Sometimes, when you cut off
the head of the snake,

07:17.040 --> 07:18.280
two grow back.

07:18.360 --> 07:21.409
Then you cut off both
heads and gut the body.

07:21.520 --> 07:23.568
TAVITIAN: Eric's death was necessary.
(WHISPERING)

07:23.640 --> 07:26.803
We would not be much of a
resistance if we did not resist.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.360
No. His reasons
are personal.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.201
He hated his brother.

07:31.280 --> 07:32.884
If his brother had been
allowed to succeed,

07:32.960 --> 07:34.246
the families would've
seen us as weak.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.607
I do not trust him.
And I don't trust you.

07:36.680 --> 07:39.524
Then we are nowhere,
and we will be crushed.

07:43.640 --> 07:45.722
This might be a good time
for you to say something.

07:53.720 --> 07:57.202
I can understand the reluctance
that some of you feel.

07:58.200 --> 08:01.363
However, my blood
gives me access

08:01.440 --> 08:02.680
to people that we need.

08:04.200 --> 08:07.488
I understand Wesen in a way
that many of you can't.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.284
And I have a Grimm.

08:13.760 --> 08:16.366
No one else brings all
this to the table.

08:18.840 --> 08:20.524
Now, there is no guarantee
that that will be enough,

08:20.600 --> 08:22.125
but we must trust each other

08:22.200 --> 08:24.248
or there will be no stopping
the Royal families.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.484
They will dominate
the world again,

08:26.560 --> 08:29.040
and those of us
who are still alive

08:30.760 --> 08:32.568
will be kneeling before them

08:33.280 --> 08:35.681
and begging for whatever
crumbs they throw at our feet.

08:35.760 --> 08:37.524
Well, we're no longer safe here.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.250
The police just found
three bodies

08:39.320 --> 08:40.650
of Verrat enforcers

08:40.720 --> 08:43.087
50 miles away at the
scene of an accident.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.689
I think it's time to go.

08:49.120 --> 08:52.329
I'm not interested
in kneeling before anyone

08:52.400 --> 08:54.004
or begging for crumbs.

08:54.960 --> 08:56.405
Nor am I.

08:57.880 --> 08:59.848
I believe you are who we need.

09:00.120 --> 09:02.168
We cannot waste
this opportunity.

09:02.240 --> 09:03.685
There might not be another.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.967
If any of you still disagree,

09:06.040 --> 09:07.804
let's deal with it now.

09:16.520 --> 09:17.931
Then we are decided.

09:18.440 --> 09:19.965
You and I are in this together.

09:22.720 --> 09:25.371
WU: The M.E. is on the way.
We've got one vic.

09:25.440 --> 09:28.922
We matched these presents to a B and
E on Thurman about 9:30 last night.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.082
So somebody steals
a bunch of presents,

09:31.160 --> 09:32.810
brings them here
to see what they got.

09:32.880 --> 09:35.326
Maybe there was more than one of them?
They got into a fight?

09:37.840 --> 09:39.729
Over this?
It's Christmas.

09:40.360 --> 09:42.249
Brings out the worst in people.

09:43.960 --> 09:45.325
Hey, Wu.

09:45.400 --> 09:46.481
What's this?

09:46.560 --> 09:47.766
WU: I think it's coal.

09:48.680 --> 09:51.001
Lump of coal and stolen
presents in the same place?

09:51.080 --> 09:52.600
Maybe it's not part
of the crime scene.

09:52.640 --> 09:54.005
I'll bag it just in case.

09:55.320 --> 09:57.687
I found the body up
here inside the car.

09:57.760 --> 09:59.569
Appears to be a teenage boy.

10:00.480 --> 10:01.766
NICK: You know who it is?

10:01.840 --> 10:02.966
FEMALE OFFICER:
Not yet.

10:03.280 --> 10:05.521
That jacket looks like
it hasn't been here long.

10:09.760 --> 10:12.127
Somebody wrote
"Q.B." on the tag.

10:14.520 --> 10:15.646
And no ID.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.371
Looks like blood on this.

10:21.760 --> 10:22.960
Let's take a look at the body.

10:23.560 --> 10:24.607
WU: I'll go in.

10:29.720 --> 10:31.529
WU: He's got some marks
on his face.

10:32.920 --> 10:34.729
Might have a wallet
in his back pocket.

10:40.560 --> 10:41.561
(SCREAMING)

10:42.880 --> 10:44.370
Not so dead.

10:45.960 --> 10:47.200
Victim's alive!

10:48.040 --> 10:50.122
(SCREAMING) NICK: Get the
paramedics down here fast.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.004
Rosalee hasn't seen
all this stuff?

10:59.080 --> 11:01.890
No, she was away last year
taking care of her aunt.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.844
Kind of feel like you guys
should be doing this together.

11:04.920 --> 11:07.127
I mean, I understand
the surprise and everything,

11:07.200 --> 11:08.690
but she's missing out
on all the fun.

11:08.760 --> 11:11.240
But this is our first official
Christmas as a couple, you know?

11:11.320 --> 11:13.368
There will be plenty of Christmases
for us to do this together,

11:13.440 --> 11:16.762
but you only get one chance to
see it all for the first time,

11:16.920 --> 11:18.843
you know, to get the full impact

11:18.920 --> 11:20.570
before she sees it in the boxes

11:20.640 --> 11:23.211
'cause if she
just sees it like this,

11:23.280 --> 11:24.691
it's kind of daunting, actually.

11:24.760 --> 11:26.489
I mean, there's 42 boxes.

11:28.120 --> 11:29.804
Kind of wish
you hadn't told me that.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.283
The only way I can
explain his reaction

11:32.360 --> 11:34.761
is that he saw something that
scared the hell out of him.

11:34.880 --> 11:36.530
What about the
scratches on his face?

11:36.600 --> 11:38.648
Could've gotten those
crawling into the car.

11:38.760 --> 11:40.364
Well, could he have
been hit by a stick?

11:40.440 --> 11:42.283
I suppose so.

11:42.360 --> 11:45.330
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me,
I need to finish my rounds.

11:47.360 --> 11:48.646
You the cops that found my son?

11:48.720 --> 11:50.324
Yes, Detective Griffin
and Burkhardt.

11:50.400 --> 11:51.481
You know what happened?

11:51.600 --> 11:53.204
Yeah, we're still trying
to piece that together.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.725
Did he say anything to you?

11:55.720 --> 11:57.484
If I tell you,
you gonna arrest him?

11:58.480 --> 12:00.323
'Cause I think you should.

12:00.600 --> 12:01.681
Arrest him for what?

12:01.760 --> 12:03.410
He stole those presents.

12:03.800 --> 12:08.761
Look, Derek is no stranger to
trouble, but this time, I...

12:09.400 --> 12:10.845
He really got himself into it.

12:10.920 --> 12:12.206
How old is Derek?

12:12.280 --> 12:14.089
Seventeen.

12:14.160 --> 12:16.128
We'll turn this
over to juvenile.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.645
We think that he was attacked.

12:18.520 --> 12:20.090
Yeah, and we found
a leather jacket

12:20.160 --> 12:22.640
at the scene, had a "Q.B."
written on the inside.

12:22.760 --> 12:24.888
Would that be Derek's?
Q.B.

12:24.960 --> 12:26.530
No, he must've stole that too.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.363
Or maybe it's Quinn's.

12:29.440 --> 12:31.727
Kid Derek hung around with?
Another loser.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.723
Do you know his last name?
Or where he lives?

12:34.760 --> 12:36.171
Sorry, I don't.

12:36.240 --> 12:37.730
We need to talk to your son.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.245
All right, be my guest.

12:43.880 --> 12:45.211
You remember us?

12:46.240 --> 12:47.810
HANK: How you
doing, Derek?

12:49.240 --> 12:51.049
I'm okay, I guess.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.120
Can you tell us
what happened last night?

12:54.840 --> 12:56.205
Somebody attacked you, right?

12:58.000 --> 12:59.411
You get into a fight
with somebody?

12:59.480 --> 13:01.005
Maybe with your friend Quinn?

13:03.320 --> 13:05.482
No.
But Quinn was there.

13:08.040 --> 13:09.280
Where is he now?

13:10.120 --> 13:11.770
I don't know.
Where did he go?

13:11.840 --> 13:13.080
Did he just run off?

13:14.040 --> 13:15.246
No.

13:16.120 --> 13:17.121
Uh...

13:18.560 --> 13:19.721
He took him.

13:22.520 --> 13:23.885
He took him.

13:24.480 --> 13:26.289
Can you describe who that was?

13:27.280 --> 13:28.406
I...

13:30.320 --> 13:31.651
I can't.

13:31.720 --> 13:34.724
Derek, if somebody took your
friend Quinn, we need to know who.

13:36.600 --> 13:37.931
What's Quinn's last name?

13:40.240 --> 13:42.049
Please don't let him get me.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.243

13:48.080 --> 13:50.128
Please don't let him take me!

13:50.200 --> 13:53.044
Don't let him take me. No,
he's comin' in here to get...

13:53.120 --> 13:54.400
We're gonna need to see some ID.

13:54.520 --> 13:56.488
Well, what did I do? Where
were you last night?

13:56.560 --> 13:57.891
Right here on this floor.

13:57.960 --> 13:59.928
This is something I do
this time of year.

14:00.720 --> 14:01.960
I'm a plumber.

14:02.040 --> 14:04.008
You know,
Al's Plumbing on Fourth?

14:05.280 --> 14:06.441
I'm AI.

14:07.320 --> 14:10.164
Since when was spreading
Christmas cheer a crime?

14:11.640 --> 14:14.166
Maybe Derek stole
from the wrong Santa.

14:14.360 --> 14:15.361
Uh-huh.

14:16.320 --> 14:17.446
All right, thanks.

14:19.120 --> 14:20.884
Derek's dad was right.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.086
His son had some problems.

14:22.160 --> 14:23.969
He's 17, already
has a rap sheet.

14:24.880 --> 14:26.962
Any luck finding Quinn?
I did.

14:27.320 --> 14:28.810
Name is Quinn Baxter.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.246
The "Q.B."
in the jacket.

14:30.320 --> 14:31.810
I could make that leap.

14:31.880 --> 14:33.609
He's got the same
juvie officer as Derek.

14:33.680 --> 14:35.011
You got an address for Quinn?

14:35.080 --> 14:36.445
Yes, I do.

14:39.040 --> 14:41.646
Thank you, Santa. Oh,
you're welcome, sweetie.

14:41.720 --> 14:43.051

He stole my bag!

Well... Well, she died.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.927
Anyway, when he
told me about Quinn,

17:56.000 --> 17:58.128
I came right over,
and we called the police.

17:58.200 --> 17:59.804
You gotta talk to him.
He's worried sick.

17:59.880 --> 18:01.291

They're here. MR. BAXTER:
We've called everyone.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.450
We've looked everywhere.
NICK: ls Quinn here?

18:07.520 --> 18:09.488
Quinn? Why would you
look for Quinn at home?

18:09.560 --> 18:11.608
If he was home, he wouldn't be
missing, which is why we called.

18:11.680 --> 18:13.091
Isn't that why you're here?

18:13.160 --> 18:14.844
MR. BAXTER: I just called.

Burkhardt and Hank Griffin.

They're detectives. I know
them both really well.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.565
Did you find my son?
No, sir.

18:21.640 --> 18:23.085
We were hoping he was here.

18:23.160 --> 18:24.650
I haven't seen him
since yesterday.

18:24.920 --> 18:26.331
He said he was gonna
do some Christmas shopping.

18:26.400 --> 18:27.640
That's the last I saw him.

18:27.720 --> 18:28.960
That's why I called the police.

18:29.040 --> 18:30.120
Isn't that why they're here?

18:30.160 --> 18:31.446
Do you know a Derek Bryce?

18:32.480 --> 18:33.891
Yeah, that's Quinn's friend.

18:34.920 --> 18:37.207
I wish he wasn't.
He's not a good kid.

18:37.400 --> 18:39.482
I mean, he's pulled Quinn into
some pretty bad situations.

18:39.560 --> 18:41.324
We found Derek
with some stolen goods,

18:41.400 --> 18:42.925
and we believe he was attacked.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.809
He's pretty scared.
He's in the hospital now.

18:44.880 --> 18:46.644
Well, what about Quinn?
We found a jacket

18:46.720 --> 18:49.929

initials "Q.B." inside.

28:16.200 --> 28:18.726
it comes from a mine
south of Longyearbyen.

28:18.840 --> 28:20.968
Capital city of
the Svalbard Islands.

28:21.040 --> 28:22.166
Where the hell is that?

28:22.240 --> 28:23.844
Northernmost tip of the Arctic.

28:23.920 --> 28:26.491
Sometimes referred to
as the North Pole.

28:26.680 --> 28:27.886
Merry Christmas.
(CHUCKLES)

28:31.120 --> 28:32.406
Now what?

28:33.840 --> 28:36.844
Now we talk to somebody
who believes in Santa.

28:36.920 --> 28:38.490
I feel horrible.

28:38.560 --> 28:41.160
It's our first official Christmas
as a couple, and I've ruined it.

28:41.240 --> 28:43.971
You didn't ruin it.
I ruined it.

28:44.320 --> 28:45.810
You should've seen his face.

28:45.880 --> 28:47.644
Out of all the people
Monroe could be with,

28:47.720 --> 28:51.122
he picks the one person
who hates Christmas.

28:51.200 --> 28:52.884
Everything out there is,

28:53.000 --> 28:54.968
red and green and...

28:55.040 --> 28:57.691
I just...
I just feel so blue.

28:57.960 --> 28:59.928
I just want it all to be over.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.525
Monroe loves this holiday.

29:02.320 --> 29:03.845
He's so cute.

29:04.800 --> 29:06.325
I don't know what to do.

29:07.280 --> 29:09.362
I'm sorry, I didn't really
wanna drag you into this,

29:09.440 --> 29:12.250
but I didn't know who else
I could drag into it.

29:12.440 --> 29:14.647
It's okay,
I'm already dragged in.

29:14.720 --> 29:16.324
I kind of helped him
set it all up.

29:16.840 --> 29:17.966
He called you for help?

29:18.040 --> 29:20.646
That is a big job,
let me just say.

29:21.520 --> 29:22.567
Wow.

29:22.640 --> 29:24.529
I'm not trying to
convince you of anything.

29:24.600 --> 29:26.090
This is really between
you and Monroe,

29:26.200 --> 29:27.440
and I don't want to
get in the middle,

29:27.520 --> 29:30.603
but maybe you guys
need to find a tradition

29:30.680 --> 29:32.842
that means something
to both of you.

29:33.520 --> 29:35.010
You mean I should bury the past?

29:35.080 --> 29:37.128
No! No, I'm just thinking
of what Nick and I did.

29:37.200 --> 29:39.965
He didn't have much
of a Christmas tradition,

29:40.040 --> 29:43.681
so he got stuck with mine,

29:43.800 --> 29:47.964
and we kind of figured out
a way to make it ours.

29:50.720 --> 29:51.801
I don't know.

29:51.880 --> 29:54.360
Just... It's been so
long since I celebrated.

29:55.480 --> 29:59.405
The only thing I really
remember is beer and cigars.

29:59.800 --> 30:00.926
Beer and cigars?

30:01.440 --> 30:04.091
My aunt used to leave Santa
a cigar and a beer,

30:04.160 --> 30:06.128
instead of milk and cookies.

30:06.280 --> 30:09.966
But I'm afraid that's not
much of a tradition.

30:10.560 --> 30:12.164
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
(DOOR OPENING)

30:12.360 --> 30:13.361
Hey, guys.

30:15.400 --> 30:16.845
What happened?

30:17.560 --> 30:20.291
Juliette said you decorated
the entire place.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.647
Yeah. We did.

30:22.880 --> 30:23.881
(SIGHS)

30:23.960 --> 30:26.122
I really don't want
to talk about it.

30:26.360 --> 30:27.885
Well, we got kind
of an unusual...

30:27.960 --> 30:30.645
I guess Christmas just means different
things to different people.

30:32.600 --> 30:33.840
Rosalee didn't like it?

30:34.120 --> 30:36.043
MONROE: It's not that she
didn't like it, per se.

30:36.120 --> 30:39.010
It's just Christmas is not
a very happy time for her.

30:39.080 --> 30:42.527
In fact, it's a dark,
black hole of depression

30:42.600 --> 30:45.046
involving the death of her
favorite aunt and uncle.

30:46.280 --> 30:47.281
Oh!

30:47.600 --> 30:48.600
Sorry.

30:48.640 --> 30:49.721
What can I do?

30:49.800 --> 30:51.848
Can't force her
to like Christmas.

30:53.200 --> 30:55.885
Anyway, what do you guys need?

30:57.760 --> 31:01.207
Well, remember a couple of
years ago, I came over here.

31:01.280 --> 31:03.203
You said you liked
to dress up as Santa,

31:03.280 --> 31:05.681
and I said,
"A Blutbad as Santa?"

31:05.960 --> 31:07.564
And you said you were no...

31:07.640 --> 31:10.405
Gefrierengeber.
Yeah, why?

31:10.560 --> 31:12.210
We've got two missing kids.

31:12.280 --> 31:14.442
And one witness
describes the kidnapper

31:14.560 --> 31:17.882
as dressing up as Santa
with a terrifying mask.

31:17.960 --> 31:20.964
Witness saw Santa stuff a kid
in his bag and take off.

31:21.080 --> 31:23.560
Could that be the
Gefrieren... Whatever?

31:23.640 --> 31:24.801
Oh, God, no.

31:25.800 --> 31:27.290
We've got nothing.

31:27.800 --> 31:28.961
Sorry to bother you.

31:30.080 --> 31:31.320
Oh, wait a minute.

31:33.160 --> 31:35.447
There wasn't any coal
left behind, was there?

31:35.520 --> 31:36.646
In both places.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.006
Does the Gefrierengeber do that?

31:38.080 --> 31:40.481
Forget the Gefrierengeber,
'cause this could be...

31:42.600 --> 31:44.250
HANK: What?
I hope I'm wrong.

31:44.320 --> 31:46.049
But if I'm not,

31:46.200 --> 31:48.965
you guys could be dealing
with something really awful.

31:49.800 --> 31:51.245
These kids that were taken,

31:51.360 --> 31:54.443
were they doing anything
that could be described

31:54.520 --> 31:57.046
or discerned as "naughty"?

31:59.200 --> 32:01.009
Well, yeah.

32:01.520 --> 32:02.931
Stole a bunch of presents,

32:03.000 --> 32:05.844
and we think one kid
was attacked by him.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.161
Okay.

32:08.400 --> 32:11.722
Did he have any kind of lash
marks on his face or body?

32:11.800 --> 32:12.881
Yeah. How'd you know?

32:12.960 --> 32:14.246
Oh, boy.

32:16.880 --> 32:18.564
That's got to be Krampus.

32:18.640 --> 32:22.042
He carries a switch and he beats
the kids mercilessly with it.

32:22.360 --> 32:23.521
Wesen?

32:24.000 --> 32:26.571
Actually, I'm not really sure.

32:27.200 --> 32:29.248
Krampus is like
Santa's evil twin.

32:29.320 --> 32:31.800
He shows up before Christmas
to punish the bad kids.

32:31.880 --> 32:33.006
Here we go.

32:35.840 --> 32:39.083
The word "Krampus" derives
from German for "claw."

32:39.160 --> 32:41.003
And on the days
leading up to Christmas,

32:41.080 --> 32:44.926
Krampus grabs naughty kids,
beats them with his switch,

32:45.000 --> 32:46.001
throws them in his sack,

32:46.080 --> 32:47.650
takes them deep into the woods

32:47.760 --> 32:49.569
and hangs them
from the tallest tree.

32:50.400 --> 32:53.051
Hangs them?
Yeah. Not to kill them.

32:53.200 --> 32:55.089
He just hangs 'em till
he's ready to eat them.

32:55.360 --> 32:56.566
He eats the kids?

32:56.640 --> 32:57.880
Yeah, pretty much.

32:58.480 --> 33:01.051
But not until the eve of the
winter solstice, the 21st.

33:01.120 --> 33:02.406
Which is today.

33:06.440 --> 33:08.727
Which means tonight
is the night he feasts.

33:11.880 --> 33:14.611
And according to the stories,

33:14.720 --> 33:19.089
Krampus always disappears just after
midnight on the winter solstice.

33:19.160 --> 33:20.730
After all the children
have been...

33:21.960 --> 33:23.371
Consumed.

33:23.680 --> 33:25.284
So if he eats these kids
before midnight,

33:25.360 --> 33:26.930
we don't have a lot
of time to stop him.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.287
Finding a tree in Portland
is like finding a needle

33:29.400 --> 33:30.561
in a thousand haystacks.

33:30.640 --> 33:32.324
Didn't you say
it was the tallest tree?

33:32.480 --> 33:33.641
Not just the tallest tree,

33:33.720 --> 33:35.563
but the tallest tree
in the tallest spot.

33:35.720 --> 33:37.529

34:03.280 --> 34:04.281
GIRL 1: I'm so cold!

34:08.320 --> 34:10.083
The trees are taller
in Forest Park.

34:10.159 --> 34:12.561
Forest Park is 5,000 acres.

34:12.639 --> 34:14.210
But that's not the tallest spot.

34:14.320 --> 34:16.322
That's Council Crest.
I think.

34:16.400 --> 34:17.925
That's 45 acres, give or take.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.364
Okay, what about
Washington Park?

34:19.440 --> 34:21.886
It's right next to Council Crest,
and it's got big trees too.

34:21.960 --> 34:23.166
We don't have a lot of time.

34:23.239 --> 34:24.560

have to pick one.

going crazy.

34:36.560 --> 34:39.440
I've been telling him that you're doing
everything you could possibly do.

34:39.480 --> 34:41.244
But something you said
bothered me.

34:41.320 --> 34:43.288
You said two lumps of coal.

34:43.760 --> 34:45.922
And... Well, that can
only mean one thing.

ALL: Krampus.

34:47.560 --> 34:48.721

he's taken the kids.

you do believe he's real.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.286

What do you mean "kids"?

34:56.360 --> 34:57.600
There's more than just Quinn.

34:57.680 --> 34:59.648
And Krampus
always takes the kids

34:59.720 --> 35:02.405
to the tallest tree
in the tallest spot.

when I was a kid...

I thought he was real.

38:24.400 --> 38:26.926
We can't just kill him on the ground.
He kidnapped six kids.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.480
And if we hadn't
gotten there in time,

38:28.520 --> 38:29.920
they would've been
Christmas dinner.

38:30.240 --> 38:31.401
Well, maybe you should do it.

38:31.480 --> 38:32.720
(STAMMERING) Well...

38:33.000 --> 38:34.411
You're the Grimm.

38:34.480 --> 38:38.007
And it's not really a Blutbad
thing to mete out justice.

38:38.080 --> 38:40.082
(GROANING) He's waking up.

38:40.880 --> 38:42.211
We need to handle this.

38:42.920 --> 38:44.160
If you try to take Krampus in,

38:44.240 --> 38:46.129
you'll have a hell of
a time explaining it.

38:47.040 --> 38:48.804
Come on, Nick.

38:48.880 --> 38:50.848
This is what
your ancestors did, okay,

38:50.920 --> 38:52.206
sometimes for the
good of all of us.

38:52.280 --> 38:54.567
We can't arrest him
and we can't let him go.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.889
This is not
an innocent man, Nick.

38:57.720 --> 38:58.960
He's Wesen.

38:59.080 --> 39:01.003
If you don't wanna
do this, I will.

39:01.080 --> 39:02.081
(GUN COCKING)

39:02.520 --> 39:04.329
(WATCH CHIMING) Oh, sorry.

39:07.080 --> 39:08.286
Midnight.

39:16.920 --> 39:18.445
Where am I?

39:19.240 --> 39:20.446
What's going on?

39:22.360 --> 39:25.887
What are you doing?
How did I get here?

39:27.800 --> 39:30.406
Oh, no.
It happened again.

39:32.160 --> 39:34.970
It happened again! No!

39:35.120 --> 39:38.727
I sort of black out, and then
I can't remember anything.

39:38.800 --> 39:40.564
It happens every December.

39:40.640 --> 39:41.760
I don't know when it starts,

39:41.800 --> 39:43.290
but I always wake up
on the 22nd.

39:43.800 --> 39:45.404
Sometimes there's blood!

39:45.480 --> 39:47.209
I don't know where it came from!

39:47.320 --> 39:50.642
I just know that I always find
myself in the woods and...

39:50.920 --> 39:52.684
Dressed like this.

39:52.920 --> 39:54.640
Well, you're a long way
from Salt Lake City.

39:55.160 --> 39:56.241
You still live there?

39:56.320 --> 39:57.651
Yeah, for three years now.

39:57.720 --> 39:59.324
How'd you get to Portland?

39:59.560 --> 40:01.324
Portland? I...

40:01.960 --> 40:03.769
I can't remember.

40:04.120 --> 40:05.326
You working?

40:05.440 --> 40:07.169
Yeah, I'm a
freelance photographer.

40:07.240 --> 40:10.449
I do weddings
and family portrait...

40:10.520 --> 40:14.002
Listen, I swear
I didn't do anything.

40:14.080 --> 40:15.844
I just shoot pictures!

40:15.920 --> 40:17.445
I didn't do anything.
I'm innocent.

40:17.560 --> 40:19.961
I'm innocent! I swear!

40:20.520 --> 40:22.045
What kind of Wesen are you?

40:22.120 --> 40:23.451
What kinda what?

40:23.520 --> 40:25.522
Wesen.
Wesen?

40:27.200 --> 40:29.965
I'm sorry, I...
I don't know what that is.

40:31.760 --> 40:33.922
NICK: At midnight,
he reverted from Krampus

40:34.000 --> 40:37.209
into a 42-year-old photographer
from Salt Lake City.

40:37.600 --> 40:41.082
Who had no recollection of what had
happened over the last three weeks.

40:43.480 --> 40:46.006
That could be why Krampus
has never been caught.

40:46.120 --> 40:47.360
How does he not know he's Wesen?

40:47.400 --> 40:50.483
Because if he's in an altered
state of mind, he wouldn't.

40:50.880 --> 40:52.769
My guess, this guy's only Woged

40:52.840 --> 40:54.251
for these three weeks
out of the year,

40:54.320 --> 40:55.481
kind of in a blackout.

40:55.560 --> 40:56.971
And once he's Krampus,

40:57.480 --> 41:00.131
he can't come out of it
until the winter solstice.

41:00.200 --> 41:02.646
I mean, maybe it's triggered by the
changing sunlight or something,

41:02.720 --> 41:05.007
like an extreme case of
seasonal affective disorder.

41:05.080 --> 41:06.969
You mean like when it gets
dark, he gets darker.

41:07.040 --> 41:08.769
Yeah, it's like
a Jekyll and Hyde thing.

41:09.040 --> 41:10.724
So what are we
gonna do with him?

41:11.120 --> 41:14.363
We're not gonna get a conviction.
Nobody can identify him.

41:14.440 --> 41:15.566
Until next year.

41:17.840 --> 41:20.161
Why don't we turn this one
over to the Wesen Council?

41:22.240 --> 41:24.846
Let them deal with it.
Works for me.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.923
I'll talk to Rosalee.

41:34.080 --> 41:35.684
(SILENT NIGHT PLAYING)

41:36.560 --> 41:37.561
(EXCLAIMS)

41:57.280 --> 41:58.281
(SIGHS)
