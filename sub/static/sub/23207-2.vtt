WEBVTT

00:07.890 --> 00:09.730
I was born with a silver spoon
in my mouth.

00:09.730 --> 00:11.850
I was educated at a private school
in England,

00:11.850 --> 00:13.650
business school in America.

00:13.650 --> 00:15.570
I run my own firm in the City.

00:16.650 --> 00:19.130
I'm very happy with my life.

00:19.130 --> 00:23.090
I have a friend in Israel.
He's very interested in investing.

00:26.410 --> 00:28.170
Vadim is still alive.

00:35.610 --> 00:38.530
The funds under investigation
include Drake Clayterman,

00:38.530 --> 00:40.250
Walkers Naylor, Cotton Capital.

00:40.250 --> 00:42.010
Where the hell is this coming from?

00:48.010 --> 00:50.050
What does it take to corrupt you?

00:50.050 --> 00:51.850
Are you afraid?

00:59.130 --> 01:00.690
Get away from the door, Mama.

01:00.690 --> 01:03.770
Vadim assumes that your father
tried to kill him, too.

01:03.770 --> 01:07.930
Neither you, your family,
nor your father are safe.

01:07.930 --> 01:10.370
I'm a banker, not a gangster.

01:10.370 --> 01:13.370
These wars are fought in
the boardrooms, not on the street.

01:13.370 --> 01:16.170
And you, Mr Godman,
are you harmless?

01:18.000 --> 01:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:27.610 --> 01:28.650
Next.

01:34.810 --> 01:36.730
Purpose of your visit?

01:36.730 --> 01:38.650
Hotel work. I'm a beauty therapist.

01:58.130 --> 01:59.450
Hi.

01:59.450 --> 02:01.210
Lyudmilla?

02:01.210 --> 02:02.850
Tarek.

02:02.850 --> 02:04.570
I work with Elena.

02:04.570 --> 02:06.690
Nice to meet you.
To meet you. This is Mido.

02:08.930 --> 02:10.130
Did you get her message?

02:10.130 --> 02:12.370
I haven't checked my phone.

02:12.370 --> 02:16.170
It's OK. She's working late tonight,
so you'll meet her at the hotel.

02:16.170 --> 02:17.210
Mido, take...

02:19.570 --> 02:22.050
So, you had a long flight?

02:23.370 --> 02:25.090
Four hours. That's OK.

02:25.090 --> 02:27.010
It's much warmer here than Moscow.

02:31.410 --> 02:33.410
So, you see over there?

02:33.410 --> 02:36.370
That's the pyramids.
So we're in Giza now.

02:36.370 --> 02:38.650
It's very small, no?

03:04.890 --> 03:06.650
Is the hotel far?

03:06.650 --> 03:07.690
15 minutes.

03:34.130 --> 03:35.170
We're here.

03:37.410 --> 03:38.690
You go with these men now.

03:40.690 --> 03:41.730
Where?

05:31.810 --> 05:34.250
Papa, do you think maybe
Frank should drive?

05:34.250 --> 05:36.170
Do you see car behind us?

05:38.050 --> 05:39.810
They've been there since Windsor.

05:46.650 --> 05:48.650
Papa, this is our exit. Yeah.

06:03.930 --> 06:07.130
We'll need to disclose
the property's history.

06:07.130 --> 06:10.410
It shouldn't affect the price,
but some buyers may be put off.

06:10.410 --> 06:11.450
Yeah, of course.

06:16.490 --> 06:19.730
We've had the room
professionally cleaned.

06:19.730 --> 06:21.650
We've left the furniture
where it was.

06:21.650 --> 06:24.450
We weren't quite sure
what you wanted to do with it.

06:39.050 --> 06:40.850
Papa, do you have the key?

08:26.410 --> 08:27.770
Da? Da.

09:18.490 --> 09:22.450
With half a million, I can bribe
officials in Chembur, Versova,

09:22.450 --> 09:26.730
Thane Creek, but the main port is...
No, it has to be the main port.

09:26.730 --> 09:29.210
That's Chopra's supply route
to Vadim.

09:29.210 --> 09:30.970
I piss on Benny Chopra's mother,

09:30.970 --> 09:33.730
but without cash
I can't take the port away from him.

09:33.730 --> 09:35.770
How much would you need?

09:35.770 --> 09:37.730
I'm a Muslim.

09:37.730 --> 09:40.810
In this country,
every dollar is 50 cents for me.

09:42.010 --> 09:46.130
He has the police in his pocket,
City Hall, the Shiv Sena and the...

09:46.130 --> 09:51.730
I'll give you 500,000 a month
to bribe those same officials

09:51.730 --> 09:54.690
and to disrupt Chopra's operations
at the port.

09:54.690 --> 09:58.890
I want his consignments checked,
his contraband seized

09:58.890 --> 10:00.290
and his cargo stolen.

10:03.970 --> 10:06.010
I respect you very much,
Semiyon Bhai.

10:07.170 --> 10:11.810
And would like us
to part as friends. Mmm-hmm?

10:11.810 --> 10:14.410
But I can't fight Benny Chopra
without more money.

10:17.490 --> 10:19.490
Thank you for taking the time
to see me.

10:42.570 --> 10:44.450
What? You should have some fun.

10:47.170 --> 10:48.210
Everything OK?

10:50.010 --> 10:52.010
Let's hope Prague is easier.

10:53.730 --> 10:55.890
This is the land of the no.

10:55.890 --> 10:59.770
They haggle, they "No, no, no,"
they walk away,

10:59.770 --> 11:02.490
then return to the table
to renegotiate.

11:04.370 --> 11:06.090
He forgot his phone.

11:06.090 --> 11:07.130
Of course he did.

11:15.850 --> 11:19.130
Forgive me, I was talking so much
I forgot my phone.

11:23.050 --> 11:26.050
Dilly, please, sit down.

11:26.050 --> 11:29.810
I've been thinking,
perhaps I can give you better terms

11:29.810 --> 11:31.570
and help you with your cash flow.

11:35.450 --> 11:38.570
Kleiman's casinos
and nightclubs are a concern.

11:38.570 --> 11:40.530
His position in the Knesset means

11:40.530 --> 11:43.730
we need to be vigilant
about any conflict of interest.

11:43.730 --> 11:45.010
But we can sign off on him?

11:46.970 --> 11:49.290
It will make a big difference.

11:49.290 --> 11:51.170
He'll replace all the capital
we've lost

11:51.170 --> 11:52.650
and invest in a new fund, as well.

11:54.410 --> 11:56.370
Just something small.

11:56.370 --> 11:57.650
He has some investment ideas

11:57.650 --> 12:00.850
that aren't the right fit
for the main fund,

12:00.850 --> 12:03.850
so I thought we'd set up
something separate.

12:03.850 --> 12:07.850
If it pans out,
we can open it up to new capital.

12:07.850 --> 12:10.090
OK. Send me the details.

13:16.850 --> 13:17.890
Shukran.

14:58.890 --> 15:00.010
Mido.

15:16.570 --> 15:19.210
Good evening, Mr Godman. Good
evening, Daniel. Forgive me, sir,

15:19.210 --> 15:21.890
but could you please have a word
with your father about his music?

15:21.890 --> 15:23.370
Mr Al-Majid's complained again.

15:24.490 --> 15:25.530
Sure.

15:28.810 --> 15:31.810
Whatever You Want by Status Quo

16:12.810 --> 16:13.850
Hi, Papa.

16:22.090 --> 16:25.730
Rebecca. I'm very glad to see you.

16:25.730 --> 16:29.010
You, too. Darling. Flowers for me?

16:29.010 --> 16:31.610
Of course. And chocolates, too. OK.

16:36.410 --> 16:37.450
Why are you here?

16:38.530 --> 16:40.290
You invited us. For dinner.

16:43.730 --> 16:45.970
Your mother never tells me anything.

16:45.970 --> 16:47.450
Ssh. Where is Mama?

16:52.010 --> 16:53.570
Sit down, Rebecca.

17:00.730 --> 17:02.050
It's me, Mama.

17:13.410 --> 17:15.730
I've had enough of the stupid man.

17:30.890 --> 17:32.730
I'm sorry.

17:32.730 --> 17:36.650
He lost his brother,
but I can't go on like this.

17:36.650 --> 17:38.330
Ssh. Mama, it's OK.

17:42.010 --> 17:43.810
He has to be a man.

17:43.810 --> 17:45.730
He can't be a child all the time.

17:51.650 --> 17:55.170
Masha, you went out with Alex
years ago.

17:55.170 --> 17:57.010
You have to move on.

17:57.010 --> 17:59.410
I know...
But what does he see in her?

17:59.410 --> 18:01.410
She's so bloody British!

18:03.610 --> 18:06.090
I bolted the window
so he couldn't get up here.

18:08.530 --> 18:09.770
I found the key.

18:09.770 --> 18:11.730
You have to help me with Papa.

18:11.730 --> 18:12.770
It's my fault.

18:14.410 --> 18:15.890
Are you coming for dinner?

18:32.050 --> 18:33.090
Speak in English.

18:35.090 --> 18:37.690
Becky doesn't understand Russian.
It's rude.

18:47.290 --> 18:50.490
Papa, did Uncle Boris ever ask you
advice on his business?

19:06.970 --> 19:08.130
Niet.

20:07.530 --> 20:09.850
No-one's going to come after you,
Papa.

20:20.010 --> 20:23.050
Papa, did you know a Semiyon Kleiman
when you were in Russia?

20:24.930 --> 20:25.970
Semiyon?

20:42.810 --> 20:44.250
Nothing.

20:44.250 --> 20:45.650
Uncle Boris mentioned him.

20:53.010 --> 20:54.450
A cobra. Cobra!

20:56.850 --> 20:57.890
Cobra.

21:11.410 --> 21:13.610
Prague is the gateway
to the Russian market.

21:13.610 --> 21:15.170
That's why it interests me

21:15.170 --> 21:17.970
So far, there's only one-way traffic
through the gate.

21:17.970 --> 21:19.730
All this is Russian controlled.

21:19.730 --> 21:21.610
We can't even operate
in our own city.

21:23.090 --> 21:24.370
The clubs, bars, girls...

21:25.770 --> 21:29.930
Everything from here to the river
is Klimov's.

21:29.930 --> 21:31.650
And Vadim's. Of course.

21:33.890 --> 21:35.210
Russians.

21:35.210 --> 21:36.850
Drinking our beer.

21:36.850 --> 21:38.330
Pimping our women.

21:38.330 --> 21:39.610
Like '89 never happened.

21:41.570 --> 21:44.450
How long have you worked
for Mr Reznik?

21:44.450 --> 21:45.690
Since I left the police.

21:46.890 --> 21:47.930
2005.

21:54.770 --> 21:55.810
Are you happy?

21:59.410 --> 22:00.450
I'm Czech.

22:03.010 --> 22:04.650
We're never happy with the boss.

22:14.450 --> 22:17.010
Smell. Real stuff, fake stuff.

22:18.130 --> 22:19.370
Tell me the difference.

22:20.730 --> 22:25.650
This used to be tractor factory
and now Chinese make tractor,

22:25.650 --> 22:26.970
I make perfumes.

22:26.970 --> 22:30.450
Mr Chanel No.5, that's me.

22:30.450 --> 22:31.770
Come.

22:31.770 --> 22:35.250
La Liga, Serie A, Premiership.

22:35.250 --> 22:36.290
You like football?

22:37.650 --> 22:39.610
Maccabi Tel Aviv.

22:39.610 --> 22:40.650
I find you.

22:42.090 --> 22:46.050
Sometimes they make mistake
so Messi play for Madrid.

22:46.050 --> 22:47.090
Free transfer.

22:48.130 --> 22:51.570
This is all very impressive,
Mr Reznik.

22:51.570 --> 22:54.610
Have you had a chance to
consider my offer?

22:55.690 --> 22:57.050
Sure.

22:57.050 --> 22:59.010
I'd like to finance your operation

22:59.010 --> 23:01.970
so you can compete
with the Russians.

23:01.970 --> 23:03.890
With Vadim Kalyagin.

23:03.890 --> 23:08.170
I don't like Russians,
but they run this country.

23:08.170 --> 23:11.770
Before war, after war, now.

23:11.770 --> 23:13.290
It is big risk.

23:14.850 --> 23:16.770
I need deposit.

23:16.770 --> 23:19.290
Five million euros.

23:19.290 --> 23:22.530
So I know you have money,

23:22.530 --> 23:23.930
and I have serious partner.

23:26.210 --> 23:27.250
Then we talk.

23:54.490 --> 23:55.530
Hey.

23:55.530 --> 23:58.610
You haven't sent the details
on the Global Fund.

23:58.610 --> 24:00.090
The fund you set up for Kleiman?

24:00.090 --> 24:02.770
Oh, don't worry. There's nothing
going on with it right now.

24:02.770 --> 24:04.970
I'll send you something
as soon as there is.

24:06.290 --> 24:07.330
Are you OK?

24:08.650 --> 24:11.370
Yeah, sure. We're back on track.

24:11.370 --> 24:13.610
I meant you, not the fund.

24:13.610 --> 24:14.650
I'm fine.

27:00.490 --> 27:01.890
You never got back to me.

27:04.210 --> 27:05.850
I'm sorry. I should have called.

27:07.010 --> 27:08.730
Still landed on your feet anyway.

27:09.810 --> 27:10.970
For now.

27:10.970 --> 27:13.410
Don't even have to change the name
of your company.

27:17.570 --> 27:20.730
So, Mr Godman,
who did you persuade to invest?

27:23.290 --> 27:26.570
A couple of investors
who saw through the rumours.

27:26.570 --> 27:28.090
But we'd always welcome more.

27:32.210 --> 27:36.610
Sydney Bloom.
The ethical face of capitalism.

27:36.610 --> 27:38.250
Do you know how he made his money?

27:39.250 --> 27:41.410
Stripping down African ports.

27:45.130 --> 27:46.250
Time to circulate.

27:53.530 --> 27:56.650
Well, the Sydney Bloom Foundation
is setting up a guarantee facility

27:56.650 --> 28:00.530
of 3 billion for small businesses
in developing markets.

28:00.530 --> 28:03.170
Of course, some of those funds
will be siphoned off

28:03.170 --> 28:06.010
through corruption,
but that's a risk we have to bear.

28:29.010 --> 28:30.370
Hello?

28:30.370 --> 28:32.370
I need you to meet me in Prague
next week.

28:33.530 --> 28:34.770
What for?

28:34.770 --> 28:37.250
I'm having issues with the Czechs.

28:37.250 --> 28:41.050
I need you to explain our business
proposal to them more clearly.

28:42.170 --> 28:43.250
What issues?

28:43.250 --> 28:46.530
They've withdrawn
the token of goodwill we sent them

28:46.530 --> 28:49.210
and now they won't return my calls.

28:50.370 --> 28:52.530
Just keep an eye on everything
for a minute.

28:52.530 --> 28:54.810
I'll be right back. Yes, sure.

28:54.810 --> 28:57.810
It's a test.
The man in charge is a gambler.

28:57.810 --> 29:00.250
He's seeing
what he can get away with.

29:00.250 --> 29:02.890
There are two ways
I can deal with this.

29:02.890 --> 29:06.690
Either I take the money back
by force, or we convince them

29:06.690 --> 29:10.490
that what they took is nothing
compared to what they can make.

29:13.330 --> 29:15.890
I agreed to move your capital
for you.

29:15.890 --> 29:17.170
That's it.

29:17.170 --> 29:19.570
Alex, I wouldn't ask
unless it was important.

29:19.570 --> 29:22.370
This man Reznik
knows nothing about finance,

29:22.370 --> 29:24.330
but there are others around him
who do.

29:26.530 --> 29:30.490
I need you to convince them,
like you convinced me.

29:30.490 --> 29:34.530
I'll introduce you as my lawyer,
you explain how they benefit.

29:34.530 --> 29:36.890
There's nothing to worry about.

29:36.890 --> 29:39.490
Prague is as important to Vadim
as Mumbai.

29:40.930 --> 29:44.890
The counterfeit and smuggling
business are worth millions.

29:44.890 --> 29:48.210
If you want to hurt him
and protect your family,

29:48.210 --> 29:50.690
this is what you have to do.

29:55.690 --> 29:56.930
I have to go.

29:56.930 --> 29:59.090
Give me a few days
and I'll go over the numbers.

29:59.090 --> 30:01.330
I'll give you an answer. OK.

30:01.330 --> 30:03.690
Good to speak to you, too. Bye.

30:05.490 --> 30:09.130
Sorry, I had to find a quiet place
to take the call.

30:09.130 --> 30:10.690
You certainly came a long way.

30:12.650 --> 30:14.010
I could kill that arsehole.

30:15.330 --> 30:17.370
Who? Alan Raynott.

30:18.370 --> 30:20.170
You seemed to handle him
pretty well.

30:20.170 --> 30:22.130
I don't know why he gets to me
so much.

30:22.130 --> 30:24.410
Even the way he says my name...
"GOD-man."

30:26.850 --> 30:29.090
He's just pissed off
you turned him down.

30:32.650 --> 30:37.090
Come on,
we should get you back in there.

30:37.090 --> 30:38.650
Who was that on the phone?

30:38.650 --> 30:39.770
It was just work.

30:58.730 --> 30:59.770
Hello?

31:11.050 --> 31:12.290
Boss?

31:12.290 --> 31:15.850
Boss, this is PJ. He's a security
guard at Chopra's compound.

31:15.850 --> 31:17.370
PJ.

31:17.370 --> 31:18.730
You have something for me?

31:19.810 --> 31:21.090
Just as you asked for it.

31:22.770 --> 31:26.010
The office in Narimba Point.
Anyone can get this map.

31:26.010 --> 31:28.530
No, this is a different office
in South Mumbai.

31:28.530 --> 31:30.490
Very top secret,
with lots of security.

32:06.810 --> 32:08.170
Move! Move!

32:18.650 --> 32:21.410
They've agreed to meet.
That's progress.

32:21.410 --> 32:24.730
Prague is Vadim's entry point
into the EU.

32:24.730 --> 32:27.610
Over half his business
passes through this city.

32:32.490 --> 32:34.370
It's good to see you again,
my friend.

32:40.490 --> 32:42.250
Nice to see you again.

32:42.250 --> 32:43.570
Hi, how are you?

32:43.570 --> 32:45.370
My lawyer, Mr Alexander.

32:46.370 --> 32:48.050
Karel Benes.

32:48.050 --> 32:49.090
Nice to meet you.

32:50.530 --> 32:52.410
I'm afraid Mr Reznik
has been held up.

32:55.370 --> 32:56.410
For how long?

32:57.730 --> 33:00.210
He'll meet us tonight.
He apologises.

33:01.450 --> 33:04.050
He's asked me to have
preliminary discussions with you.

33:06.050 --> 33:07.090
Please.

33:09.650 --> 33:13.170
I'm willing to accept Mr Reznik
not getting back to me

33:13.170 --> 33:15.530
because of personal issues.

33:16.850 --> 33:20.330
The money I advanced him
was a gesture of goodwill,

33:20.330 --> 33:22.930
so he's free to spend it
as he wishes.

33:22.930 --> 33:25.770
But I also believe
that I have demonstrated

33:25.770 --> 33:27.610
that I am a serious partner.

33:29.370 --> 33:31.490
I've had that discussion with him.

33:31.490 --> 33:34.890
Mr Reznik is concerned
any increased activity from us

33:34.890 --> 33:36.770
will draw attention
from the Russians.

33:36.770 --> 33:39.330
I was led to believe
Mr Reznik's ambitions

33:39.330 --> 33:41.370
were to compete with the Russians.

33:42.770 --> 33:45.970
Now I ask myself
if he's a serious partner.

33:45.970 --> 33:50.490
Klimov and the Russian gangs
have the backing of Vadim.

33:50.490 --> 33:53.610
Vadim has the backing of elements
within the Russian state.

33:54.850 --> 33:57.850
Our government is so busy
trying to be a Western democracy

33:57.850 --> 33:59.450
it wants nothing to do with us.

33:59.450 --> 34:01.650
Then I'll have to take my business
elsewhere.

34:01.650 --> 34:04.890
With respect, we're here to persuade
Mr Reznik that he doesn't

34:04.890 --> 34:08.090
need state protection to further
his business opportunities.

34:11.050 --> 34:12.210
The world has moved on.

34:15.449 --> 34:18.570
What we're offering you
is a substantial investment

34:18.570 --> 34:21.489
with very few strings attached.

34:21.489 --> 34:24.850
All we ask is that you make life
uncomfortable for Vadim

34:24.850 --> 34:26.650
and his associates.

34:26.650 --> 34:30.210
Bribes to officials,
seizures of their contraband.

34:30.210 --> 34:32.090
And we will pay for everything.

34:33.370 --> 34:36.610
I'll leave Mr Alexander
to talk you through the details.

35:59.970 --> 36:01.810
I'll have the poultry menu, please.

36:01.810 --> 36:04.810
The medieval menu for me.
And to drink?

36:04.810 --> 36:06.850
Just sparkling mineral water.

36:14.730 --> 36:18.010
The one thing your boss overlooks
is stupidity.

36:18.010 --> 36:19.450
He's a clever man,

36:19.450 --> 36:23.690
but he thinks he's dealing
with someone like himself.

36:23.690 --> 36:28.370
Reznik has only three circuits
in his brain - yes, no, later.

36:29.810 --> 36:31.330
What should my boss have done?

36:32.610 --> 36:34.210
Send a message before you came.

36:35.210 --> 36:37.490
Maybe burn down
one of our factories.

36:37.490 --> 36:40.210
That way the negotiations
would have been more serious.

36:40.210 --> 36:43.490
So you think
we're wasting our time?

36:43.490 --> 36:47.250
There are better restaurants in
Prague he could have taken you to.

36:47.250 --> 36:49.970
If he's so stupid,
why do you work for him?

36:49.970 --> 36:51.650
Why does anybody work for a boss?

36:55.930 --> 36:59.410
I was fired from my job
and he offered me a good salary.

36:59.410 --> 37:00.970
It's quite a leap.

37:02.210 --> 37:04.570
From policeman to this.

37:05.690 --> 37:07.330
Not in this country.

37:08.930 --> 37:10.530
And you, Mr Alexander,

37:10.530 --> 37:14.130
how does a lawyer like you get
mixed up in a business like this?

37:15.570 --> 37:17.770
I just sit behind a desk
and read contracts.

37:25.730 --> 37:26.770
"Later."

37:28.050 --> 37:30.090
Look, I don't want to bore you,

37:30.090 --> 37:33.250
but Vadim and Klimov
make more than 600 million annually

37:33.250 --> 37:37.130
from their counterfeit and smuggling
operations in this country.

37:37.130 --> 37:39.090
Your boss makes 20.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.690
Plus the five he stole from you.

37:43.450 --> 37:45.650
You've already convinced me
of the benefits

37:45.650 --> 37:47.850
of doing business with you
this afternoon.

37:48.850 --> 37:53.890
But unfortunately, people like you
and I don't have much influence.

37:53.890 --> 37:57.570
If we did, I'm sure
we could reach an agreement.

38:01.610 --> 38:04.730
I think you'll find my boss
is a reasonable man, too.

38:04.730 --> 38:06.570
You're being modest.

38:06.570 --> 38:09.530
You forget, I'm a former policeman.

38:09.530 --> 38:12.210
I still have contacts in the police.
At the airport.

38:13.850 --> 38:16.210
You shouldn't travel
under your own passport.

38:18.410 --> 38:20.890
You come from
a distinguished family, Mr Godman.

38:22.370 --> 38:25.730
Perhaps you should be sitting
at that table instead of with me.

38:25.730 --> 38:29.370
You are wasting my time tonight
with this ridiculous display.

38:29.370 --> 38:32.010
Do you think I would want
to invest...?

38:32.010 --> 38:35.290
Perhaps we should both move tables.
It makes you look like a fool.

38:48.330 --> 38:51.330
If you have nothing else to say
to me, I would like to go home.

38:54.290 --> 38:56.650
There is an earlier flight.

38:56.650 --> 38:58.770
It gets you into Heathrow
before ten.

38:58.770 --> 38:59.930
That would be helpful.

39:02.690 --> 39:05.770
If you could also arrange
a connecting flight for Mr Kleiman.

39:07.810 --> 39:08.850
Of course.

39:12.890 --> 39:14.570
What are you going to do?

39:14.570 --> 39:16.890
Put my money to better use
than I did this time.

39:18.210 --> 39:19.290
These pricks.

39:19.290 --> 39:22.010
They have no idea how big a world
will come down on them.

39:28.930 --> 39:30.530
How does that help us in Prague?

39:31.770 --> 39:33.250
Ah, forget Prague.

39:33.250 --> 39:35.130
We concentrate on Mumbai.

39:35.130 --> 39:37.690
Until I can find someone here
I can do business with.

39:56.410 --> 39:59.290
We don't have long,
so I'll make this very clear.

39:59.290 --> 40:02.890
You're someone we'd be very happy
to do business with.

40:06.170 --> 40:10.330
If he finds out I'm even talking
to you, he could have me killed.

40:10.330 --> 40:13.250
Then we're both caught
between a rock and a hard place.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.330
A partnership is good for everyone.

40:21.330 --> 40:23.530
A disagreement isn't.

40:23.530 --> 40:25.690
Please ask Mr Reznik to reconsider.

41:14.290 --> 41:15.530
Only the Russian girls.

41:30.530 --> 41:31.970
Who speaks English?

41:31.970 --> 41:33.010
Yes. Yes.

41:36.610 --> 41:37.770
Moskvy.

41:39.330 --> 41:40.370
How old?

41:43.090 --> 41:45.050
22.

41:45.050 --> 41:47.010
You look younger.

41:47.010 --> 41:48.050
No.

41:49.170 --> 41:50.210
I like her face.

41:52.810 --> 41:53.970
I'll take her.

42:09.170 --> 42:11.530
Oh, look! Hey.

42:11.530 --> 42:14.130
Hey!
I didn't expect you till tomorrow.

42:14.130 --> 42:15.850
The meeting finished early.

42:18.290 --> 42:20.250
Well, have you eaten anything?

42:20.250 --> 42:22.450
I'm fine. I ate on the plane.

42:22.450 --> 42:25.090
Is Prague as beautiful as they say?

42:25.090 --> 42:26.530
I didn't get to see much.

42:30.890 --> 42:33.090
Pour me a wine.
I'm going to go and dump this.

43:08.610 --> 43:10.770
What kind of view is this?

43:10.770 --> 43:13.410
You like sniffing ladies garments?

43:13.410 --> 43:14.450
This way, Bhai.

43:17.290 --> 43:18.890
You see? Perfect.

43:20.050 --> 43:21.810
You can see everyone who goes in.

43:21.810 --> 43:24.890
Chopra's lawyers, business partners,
officials he bribes.

43:31.490 --> 43:33.130
Benny Chopra.

43:33.130 --> 43:34.730
Let's see who's God.

46:49.010 --> 46:50.050
It's me.

46:52.010 --> 46:55.490
I want just to talk to you.

49:56.810 --> 49:57.850
Mama?

50:02.690 --> 50:03.730
Alex!

50:06.370 --> 50:08.850
Is Katya with you? Hi, Becky.

50:08.850 --> 50:10.650
No. No?

50:10.650 --> 50:12.090
Where is she?

50:12.090 --> 50:13.490
Where the hell is she?! Shh...

50:13.490 --> 50:16.050
She should be here! Shh.

50:16.050 --> 50:17.090
Hey.

50:22.250 --> 50:23.290
Papa?

50:37.330 --> 50:38.370
It's raining.

50:40.610 --> 50:42.130
We're in London, Papa.

50:45.290 --> 50:46.650
Where is she?

50:47.930 --> 50:49.930
All she cares about is herself.

50:54.850 --> 50:57.170
I can't reach her.

50:57.170 --> 50:59.410
I've tried her friends
she was out with,

50:59.410 --> 51:01.490
but they're not answering either.

51:01.490 --> 51:03.570
Did you leave a message?

51:03.570 --> 51:06.850
I didn't want to tell her
on the phone. I said it was urgent.

51:10.130 --> 51:11.490
Is it her?

51:11.490 --> 51:12.530
No.

51:14.570 --> 51:16.130
Sorry, Femi. One second.

51:19.010 --> 51:21.370
- Hi?
- Reznik is dead.

51:27.770 --> 51:29.250
Yep.

51:29.250 --> 51:30.890
It was an accident.

51:30.890 --> 51:35.010
It seems he was drunk and fell off
the balcony of his apartment.

51:36.490 --> 51:39.010
What did you say to Benes
at the airport?

51:40.850 --> 51:43.530
That I hoped he was someone
we could do business with.

51:46.050 --> 51:48.410
It seems you were right.

51:48.410 --> 51:49.770
Anything else?

51:49.770 --> 51:51.810
No.

51:51.810 --> 51:53.450
This is how it works, I'm afraid.

51:54.890 --> 51:56.170
That's all you had to say.

51:59.890 --> 52:01.050
I can't talk right now.

52:03.570 --> 52:05.570
We got what we wanted, Alex.

52:05.570 --> 52:06.610
This is good news.

52:08.890 --> 52:09.930
I'll call you later.

52:36.930 --> 52:38.210
You must be exhausted.

52:40.890 --> 52:42.290
Here, have a chocolate.

52:44.930 --> 52:47.290
It will get easier now. Please.

52:58.770 --> 53:01.250
Tanya tells me
that your mother is not well.

53:02.370 --> 53:03.770
Her kidneys?

53:06.890 --> 53:08.930
She needs an operation.

53:08.930 --> 53:09.970
We will see to it.

53:11.490 --> 53:12.970
We will help each other.

53:14.570 --> 53:17.210
I have many friends
who will like you.

53:17.210 --> 53:18.370
Men I do business with.

53:20.570 --> 53:22.050
No.

53:22.050 --> 53:23.530
Don't worry.

53:23.530 --> 53:27.130
I don't expect you to do anything
you don't want to do.

53:27.130 --> 53:29.250
Just talk to them,

53:29.250 --> 53:31.170
listen to what they have to say,

53:31.170 --> 53:33.130
and then we will send you home.

53:54.770 --> 53:57.610
I'm sorry. I was out and my phone
was off and I didn't know.

53:57.610 --> 53:58.850
I'm sorry. Shh.

54:02.530 --> 54:04.250
Are you not ashamed?

54:04.250 --> 54:06.090
It's all right, Mama,
she's here now.

54:08.330 --> 54:09.730
Did he get out of the window?

54:10.810 --> 54:12.810
I locked it again. It wasn't
your fault.
