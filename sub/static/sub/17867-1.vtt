01:13.274 --> 01:14.875
<i>My name is Afshin Ghaffarian.</i>

01:17.211 --> 01:18.377
<i>I am a citizen of Iran.</i>

01:21.615 --> 01:23.148
<i>And I'm a dancer.</i>

02:29.883 --> 02:31.884
Afshin! Afshin!

02:31.886 --> 02:35.521
Afshin! Afshin! Afshin!

02:35.523 --> 02:37.689
Afshin! Afshin!

02:37.691 --> 02:38.757
Afshin! Af...

02:49.169 --> 02:50.502
Afshin, give me your hand.

02:50.504 --> 02:51.625
Give me your hand.

02:55.275 --> 02:56.475
Afshin, what did you do?

02:57.744 --> 02:59.378
I danced in class.

02:59.380 --> 03:00.461
The teacher hit me.

03:02.582 --> 03:04.502
You see those men over there?

03:04.784 --> 03:06.185
They are the Basij,

03:06.853 --> 03:08.187
the morality police.

03:09.322 --> 03:11.256
If they catch you dancing,

03:11.258 --> 03:12.558
they will do worse than this.

03:13.593 --> 03:15.794
But why?

03:15.796 --> 03:18.597
Because they say
dancing is forbidden.

03:18.599 --> 03:21.039
So if you're going to do it,
you do it somewhere safe.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.656
They are afraid
of no one, Afshin.

03:27.340 --> 03:28.807
And if they ever come for you,

03:29.609 --> 03:30.509
you run.

03:31.911 --> 03:33.278
<i>Afshin Ghaffarian.</i>

03:33.980 --> 03:35.547
Sir.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.515
Sit down.

03:38.384 --> 03:39.351
So...

03:40.720 --> 03:41.853
You like dancing?

03:45.992 --> 03:47.872
Have you ever heard
of the Saba?

03:51.497 --> 03:54.499
It's an art center,
here in Mashhad.

03:54.501 --> 03:57.269
It's not like
any other normal school.

03:59.706 --> 04:01.707
It's a very well-kept secret.

04:03.009 --> 04:04.476
<i>I think you'll like it there.</i>

04:05.712 --> 04:06.945
<i>It's run</i>

04:06.947 --> 04:08.380
by a charming man.

04:10.850 --> 04:12.918
<i>Tomorrow, 4:00.</i>

04:13.820 --> 04:15.020
<i>Be there.</i>

04:18.725 --> 04:21.593
Today, I want you... Afshin!

04:22.662 --> 04:23.962
Welcome to the Saba.

04:24.897 --> 04:25.978
Please, do come in.

04:29.002 --> 04:30.402
Take a seat.

04:32.972 --> 04:34.973
Here, you call me Mehdi.

04:36.843 --> 04:39.203
There are things you need
to understand, Afshin.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.514
Our country is like

04:44.517 --> 04:47.486
two parallel worlds
running alongside each other.

04:48.888 --> 04:50.889
There is the one
you see outside,

04:50.891 --> 04:52.724
and there's this one,

04:52.726 --> 04:55.294
this world,
behind closed doors.

04:57.463 --> 04:58.764
Outside there are laws,

05:00.400 --> 05:01.833
commandments and sin.

05:02.769 --> 05:05.304
In here, we are free.

05:06.606 --> 05:07.773
Here.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.729
Here's your Saba
membership card.

05:12.578 --> 05:14.446
You've got a lot to learn.

05:14.448 --> 05:16.648
But that's a great thing.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.551
All right, everybody, concentrate.
I want you all to listen

05:19.553 --> 05:22.321
to this piece
of music, carefully.

05:22.323 --> 05:24.456
It's from a faraway land.

05:24.458 --> 05:27.392
Written by
an incredible artist.

05:27.394 --> 05:29.795
It's about life, about passion,

05:30.830 --> 05:32.698
creation.

05:32.700 --> 05:36.001
Let it speak to you. Let it stir
the emotions in your heart.

06:04.430 --> 06:05.430
Ooh!

06:16.642 --> 06:18.443
You don't understand.

06:18.445 --> 06:20.145
I coulda had class.

06:20.147 --> 06:21.713
I coulda been a contender.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.744
Mehdi,

06:52.746 --> 06:53.867
why do they hate us?

06:55.848 --> 06:58.750
Girls and boys
sitting in the same room,

06:58.752 --> 07:01.119
studying the arts,
that's a sin in their eyes.

07:04.757 --> 07:06.525
- Will they be back?
- Oh, yes.

07:09.529 --> 07:10.562
So,

07:11.063 --> 07:12.164
what do we do?

07:15.635 --> 07:16.668
Get new windows.

07:26.712 --> 07:27.846
That, Afshin,

07:28.781 --> 07:29.981
is Rudolf Nureyev.

07:31.818 --> 07:33.518
He was Russian.

07:33.520 --> 07:36.241
He fled to Paris because they
were trying to imprison him.

07:40.159 --> 07:41.760
It reminds me of Rumi's poem.

07:43.496 --> 07:46.031
"In your light,
I learned how to love."

07:48.000 --> 07:49.067
"In your beauty,."

07:50.203 --> 07:51.736
"I found poetry."

07:54.006 --> 07:55.507
"You dance inside my heart,"

07:57.043 --> 07:59.083
"where no one else
can see you."

08:06.152 --> 08:07.886
Watch it some more.

08:07.888 --> 08:08.854
I'll be back.

08:58.170 --> 09:00.672
Mousavi! Mousavi!

09:00.674 --> 09:04.876
Mousavi! Mousavi!
Mousavi! Mousavi!

09:04.878 --> 09:08.613
Mousavi! Mousavi!

09:08.615 --> 09:10.815
<i>Rallies are</i>
<i>taking place all over Iran</i>

09:10.817 --> 09:13.084
<i>for the upcoming elections.</i>

09:13.086 --> 09:15.220
<i>The main challenger to the
current president, Ahmadinejad,</i>

09:15.222 --> 09:17.989
<i>is Mir-Hossein Mousavi.</i>

09:17.991 --> 09:21.660
<i>Ringing across</i>
<i>the streets of Tehran.</i>

10:13.179 --> 10:15.259
Okay. Nice to see
some new faces.

10:36.335 --> 10:37.636
It's a shame.

10:39.839 --> 10:41.079
I thought it was pretty good.

10:42.842 --> 10:45.176
Yeah.

10:45.178 --> 10:47.946
Yeah. It's always the same,
you know,

10:47.948 --> 10:50.548
I put it up, they tear it down.
I paint it on the wall,

10:51.283 --> 10:53.251
and they, uh, cover it up.

10:53.253 --> 10:54.786
Uh, expression repression.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.087
It's our little game.

10:56.089 --> 10:58.089
But I've got plenty more paint.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.994
Uh, I'm Afshin.

11:06.899 --> 11:07.799
Ardi.

11:11.137 --> 11:13.138
- Sorry.
- It's okay. It's fine.

11:13.140 --> 11:15.840
- It's your second day, huh?
First year. -Yeah.

11:15.842 --> 11:17.042
Where are you from? Tehran?

11:17.044 --> 11:18.125
No, I'm from Mashhad.

11:20.446 --> 11:21.880
Mashdi.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.917
- What? -Wow, you're a
long way from home, huh?

11:25.919 --> 11:28.053
Yeah.

11:28.055 --> 11:30.175
Well, uh, you're gonna need
to know some ground rules.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.323
Like what?

11:32.325 --> 11:34.192
Well, even in university,
you have to be careful.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.193
Look. You see?

11:36.829 --> 11:38.730
- Student Basij.
- Basij?

11:39.832 --> 11:41.866
- Here?
- Yeah, look.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.368
What is he doing? Is he
confiscating her book?

11:43.370 --> 11:45.003
It must be illegal.

11:45.005 --> 11:46.285
But we have to make a stand.

11:47.239 --> 11:48.907
- You stay here. Stay.
- What?

11:48.909 --> 11:51.443
- Stay here.
- Ar... Ardi, wait. No, Ardi.

11:53.079 --> 11:55.213
Hey! What the hell
are you doing?

11:55.215 --> 11:58.349
- Ardi! -Hey, man. How are you?
Sorry I'm late.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.719
Thanks for waiting. Hey, I want
you to meet my new friend.

12:00.721 --> 12:03.321
Afshin! Afshin, come here.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.724
Afshin, this is
my friend Mehran.

12:05.726 --> 12:07.726
- Hi.
- Yeah, this is Afshin, Mona.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.160
- Hi.
- Mona, Afshin.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.523
I hope he hasn't
corrupted you yet.

12:10.997 --> 12:14.232
- Give him time. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Very funny.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.767
Actually, what time is it?

12:15.769 --> 12:17.068
Come on. We're gonna be late.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.037
Hey, so, are you
coming tonight?

12:19.039 --> 12:22.874
Yeah. Actually, Mashdi,
you're coming, too.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.509
Meet us here, outside
the gates, 10:00.

12:24.511 --> 12:25.944
Okay? Bye.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.345
Come on, let's go.

12:27.347 --> 12:28.513
So, nice to meet you.

12:28.515 --> 12:30.415
- Yeah, you, too.
- See you later.

12:32.486 --> 12:34.352
- This traffic is crazy.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.521
So I keep on seeing Mehran

12:36.523 --> 12:38.757
in my drama class,

12:38.759 --> 12:39.891
but he doesn't look like
someone who studies drama.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.960
So I find out
his big secret, okay,

12:41.962 --> 12:44.829
and it turns out that he
is an engineering student

12:44.831 --> 12:46.164
who keeps on sneaking
into my class.

12:46.166 --> 12:48.867
- I mean, that's pretty cool.
- That's not exactly true.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.468
That is exactly true.

12:50.470 --> 12:51.970
Where are we going?

12:54.874 --> 12:56.908
Hey, guys.

13:02.516 --> 13:06.084
Afshin, welcome to the
Ayatollah's worst nightmare.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.103
That's her boyfriend. Naser.

13:25.105 --> 13:28.139
He's a... Actually,
he's a student director.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.575
He's taking a theater trip
to Paris next year.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.297
Lucky bastard's getting out.

13:33.345 --> 13:34.312
What are they smoking?

13:35.181 --> 13:36.481
Heroin.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.883
The regime is, um...

13:38.885 --> 13:40.285
They're flooding the streets
with the shit, you know?

13:40.287 --> 13:42.088
They want...
They want to numb us.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.357
Okay, come on,
let's forget them.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.959
Let's go have some fun, eh?
Let's party. Come on.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.581
Cyrus. How are you?
Good to see you.

14:39.579 --> 14:41.946
Ah, Beluga Vodka.

14:41.948 --> 14:43.708
Oh, fancy.
You guys want a drink?

14:46.986 --> 14:48.266
Wait, you can get YouTube?

14:49.555 --> 14:50.676
What about the firewall?

14:51.457 --> 14:53.524
Proxy server.

14:53.526 --> 14:55.286
Here, Afshin.
I think you'll like this.

14:56.229 --> 15:01.065
<i>Broadcast in</i>
<i>stealth from Washington, D.C.,</i>

15:01.067 --> 15:04.202
<i>this is the unofficial, true
voice of the Persian Youth.</i>

15:06.606 --> 15:08.606
Pretty cool, huh?

15:08.608 --> 15:11.509
<i>The voice, the regime</i>
<i>doesn't want you to hear.</i>

15:12.645 --> 15:14.178
Hey, guys.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.980
Come on. Food's ready.

15:15.982 --> 15:18.102
Yeah, all right.
We're coming now.

15:19.051 --> 15:20.418
Do you mind if I...

15:20.420 --> 15:22.140
No, man. Knock yourself out.

15:47.012 --> 15:48.146
<i>Come on!</i>

15:49.248 --> 15:51.249
<i>All right!</i>

17:12.164 --> 17:14.365
Afshin.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.767
You watch too much
YouTube, my friend.

17:15.769 --> 17:17.435
He's good, huh?

17:17.436 --> 17:19.670
Hey, Afshin.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.571
Show me that, man. I've always...
I've always wanted to do that.

17:21.574 --> 17:22.640
Which one?

17:22.642 --> 17:23.741
That was it, the moonwalk.

17:23.742 --> 17:25.742
- The moonwalk?
- Yeah.

17:25.744 --> 17:27.111
So, show me how? Okay.
So, you weight this leg.

17:27.113 --> 17:28.579
- Yeah.
- Then, switch.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.515
And then push back. Switch.

17:30.517 --> 17:32.350
- Okay, switch. You're going
to spoil your appetite.

17:32.352 --> 17:34.786
Hey, guys. Time to eat.
Come on.

17:34.788 --> 17:36.120
Time to eat.

17:37.189 --> 17:38.756
Afshin, come get some food.

17:52.805 --> 17:54.805
You know, guys,
I've been thinking.

17:55.441 --> 17:57.242
I want to start a dance group.

17:58.510 --> 18:00.244
What?

18:00.246 --> 18:02.447
- I want to start a dance group.
- Yeah.

18:02.449 --> 18:03.815
Start one in the canteen.

18:03.817 --> 18:05.683
Dance on the tables...

18:05.685 --> 18:08.586
- Look, Mehran, I'm serious.
- ...with the professors.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.428
Who are you... Who are you gonna
find to be in a dance group?

18:13.092 --> 18:15.226
Look, it's illegal, right?

18:15.228 --> 18:18.663
- Dance is illegal. -It's
not illegal, technically.

18:18.665 --> 18:20.364
- It's forbidden.
- Yeah, okay, forbidden.

18:20.366 --> 18:21.632
But totally forbidden.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.267
Come on, Naser. So's vodka.

18:23.269 --> 18:26.237
Wait, so you want us
to start a dance group?

18:26.239 --> 18:28.873
No, I want us to take
control of our lives.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.675
You know,
have somewhere that's ours,

18:30.677 --> 18:31.742
where we can create.

18:31.744 --> 18:33.144
"Somewhere that's ours."

18:34.179 --> 18:35.546
Yeah,

18:35.548 --> 18:36.848
with no rules.

18:36.850 --> 18:38.749
No rules, huh?

18:38.751 --> 18:40.118
I'd love to dance.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.619
- Mona.
- What?

18:41.621 --> 18:42.653
You guys are crazy.

18:46.892 --> 18:49.494
So, how would we do it?

18:49.496 --> 18:52.396
Well, we'd have to
keep it a secret.

18:52.398 --> 18:55.466
- Who's going to teach us?
- YouTube.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.869
YouTube? Cyrus is right.
You are crazy.

18:57.871 --> 19:01.405
- Just because you can't dance.
- Look, this isn't a joke, Mona.

19:01.407 --> 19:03.327
You get caught dancing,
you go to prison.

19:05.244 --> 19:07.745
You know what happened
to my friend.

19:07.747 --> 19:11.849
Just a few months in Evin,
and his hair was white.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.651
We hear you, Naser.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.693
Yeah, come on,
Naser, no one wants that.

19:18.757 --> 19:19.838
You know, when I dance,

19:21.160 --> 19:23.327
I feel free.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.763
You know, it's like
no one can take that away.

19:25.765 --> 19:26.898
It's... It's limitless.

19:31.203 --> 19:32.324
So you really want this?

19:33.305 --> 19:34.205
I do.

19:35.674 --> 19:36.954
Mehran, what do you think?

19:37.876 --> 19:39.577
It's different.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.499
An underground dance company.

19:44.483 --> 19:45.763
No, I think it's a great idea.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.469
We need somewhere to rehearse.

19:53.492 --> 19:55.612
There's nowhere
in the university.

19:56.261 --> 19:57.428
What about your cousin?

19:57.430 --> 19:59.197
She owns that
old building, right?

19:59.199 --> 20:00.731
- The printing factory?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.867
<i>That's empty. Maybe there's</i>
<i>somewhere there.</i>

20:02.869 --> 20:05.336
<i>No one would know.</i>

20:05.338 --> 20:08.459
- Except the Basij. -In a
disused printing factory?

20:08.740 --> 20:10.241
<i>Tell her,</i>
<i>it's for extra studies.</i>

20:10.243 --> 20:12.276
<i>Yeah, just say it's for</i>

20:12.278 --> 20:13.644
theater studies,
something like that.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.366
We just need one quiet room.

20:15.847 --> 20:16.968
<i>Something out of sight.</i>

20:32.864 --> 20:34.332
It's perfect.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.000
Yes!

20:39.905 --> 20:42.905
Yeah, no, of course, of course.
As long as it's safe.

20:44.876 --> 20:46.577
Let's start tomorrow.

20:46.579 --> 20:49.780
Are we sure it's going to be secure?
Is it going to be safe?

20:49.782 --> 20:51.949
- What if we're found out?
- We'll be fine.

20:51.951 --> 20:54.418
I'm more worried about
cleaning that room.

20:54.420 --> 20:57.355
We'll travel separately.
Hide the key outside.

20:57.357 --> 20:59.257
It just feels like it
should be harder somehow.

20:59.259 --> 21:00.958
It will be.
You've seen Ardi dance.

21:02.661 --> 21:03.861
Uh...

21:04.763 --> 21:05.963
I'm amazing.

21:11.271 --> 21:12.536
- Okay, ready?
- Yeah.

21:12.538 --> 21:13.671
Let's go.

21:14.873 --> 21:16.874
Ardi, come on, set the curve.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.309
Okay, so there are some movements
that I think you should try.

21:18.311 --> 21:20.778
Um, what do you think?

21:20.780 --> 21:22.013
- Um...

21:25.951 --> 21:27.652
Yeah, okay. So, um...

21:28.553 --> 21:30.321
You start with the leg.

21:32.392 --> 21:34.553
Are we going to be
doing it like...

21:42.067 --> 21:44.402
So, this is the dance group.

21:45.470 --> 21:48.339
- How did you... -If
you want to be smart,

21:48.341 --> 21:51.341
maybe the last one should
take the key with them.

21:56.715 --> 21:57.882
Relax.

21:58.784 --> 22:00.351
I overheard you.

22:00.353 --> 22:01.819
No one else knows.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.321
If anybody else had,

22:03.323 --> 22:04.889
I wouldn't have come.

22:04.891 --> 22:06.757
So, can I audition?

22:08.427 --> 22:09.727
Have we met before?

22:09.729 --> 22:11.429
No.

22:11.431 --> 22:12.463
I'm Elaheh.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.702
Guys, who is this girl?

22:25.077 --> 22:26.344
Okay.

25:14.212 --> 25:15.579
So?

25:17.516 --> 25:18.949
Uh...

25:18.951 --> 25:20.050
Okay, sure.

25:20.052 --> 25:21.519
Okay. Let's start.

25:28.159 --> 25:30.828
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:32.297 --> 25:33.764
So, uh, what do you think?

25:35.567 --> 25:37.768
You have commitment.

25:37.770 --> 25:39.730
But you need to work
on technique.

25:39.871 --> 25:41.138
A lot.

25:41.140 --> 25:43.140
Without that, you have nothing.

25:44.976 --> 25:45.943
Who taught you?

25:47.212 --> 25:49.613
My mother.

25:49.615 --> 25:52.055
Before the revolution, she was
in the Iranian National Ballet.

25:52.083 --> 25:53.817
In Tehran?

25:53.819 --> 25:55.319
Of course.

25:55.321 --> 25:57.361
Back then, they were
the stars of their day.

25:59.224 --> 26:01.926
Even Nureyev and Fonteyn came
and taught them <i> Le Corsaire.</i>

26:01.928 --> 26:03.327
Wait. Rudolf Nureyev was here?

26:04.963 --> 26:06.203
Doesn't seem real, does it?

26:08.733 --> 26:09.700
Tell me more.

26:11.036 --> 26:13.103
There were about 50 dancers.

26:13.105 --> 26:14.385
Mainly from Iran and Europe.

26:15.006 --> 26:16.740
Some Americans.

26:16.742 --> 26:18.309
Then dance became
the great big sin,

26:18.311 --> 26:19.591
and it all came to an end.

26:20.812 --> 26:21.779
Okay?

26:23.915 --> 26:24.996
See you tomorrow.

27:36.388 --> 27:38.428
You know, there's this video
I found online.

27:39.357 --> 27:42.660
It's, uh... It's about Fosse.

27:42.662 --> 27:45.783
It's, uh... It's interesting. I thought
maybe we should watch it together.

27:47.699 --> 27:49.500
Afshin, are you asking me out?

27:52.370 --> 27:54.738
I don't know.
What... What if you said no?

27:55.907 --> 27:58.042
Can you cook?

27:58.044 --> 28:01.145
Uh, I make Ghormeh sabzi.
It's pretty good.

28:01.147 --> 28:03.881
- Says who?
<i>- Maman.</i>

28:10.922 --> 28:12.690
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:12.692 --> 28:13.791
How's it going?

28:14.893 --> 28:16.393
My TV's down.

28:16.395 --> 28:18.676
It's the election debate.
Everyone's watching.

28:19.130 --> 28:21.031
Mousavi's on.

28:21.033 --> 28:22.900
He's promising to disband
the morality police.

28:22.902 --> 28:25.262
Man, I am telling you,
the president is history.

28:27.338 --> 28:29.938
<i>As the race for Iran's
presidential election heats up...</i>

28:34.012 --> 28:35.012
Brother.

28:40.885 --> 28:43.405
- How's <i> Maman?</i> -Is that
why you think I'm here?

28:43.788 --> 28:45.189
I don't know why you're here.

28:45.191 --> 28:46.824
It's been a while, brother.

28:46.826 --> 28:49.193
I feel like
you've been avoiding me.

28:49.195 --> 28:51.515
- Sorry. -It's okay. You
have to work hard.

28:52.497 --> 28:53.864
Are you making friends?

28:55.900 --> 28:57.021
I keep my head down.

28:58.002 --> 28:59.002
Good.

29:02.107 --> 29:04.027
Okay, you got me. I admit it.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.504
I've come to ask for a favor.

29:09.514 --> 29:11.849
People are making trouble
at the elections.

29:13.084 --> 29:15.252
Enemies of our president.

29:15.254 --> 29:17.821
This university is
full of them.

29:17.823 --> 29:19.857
The Basij needs eyes
on the inside.

29:22.093 --> 29:23.373
Will you help me, brother?

29:27.866 --> 29:29.707
My exams are in two months.

29:30.969 --> 29:32.469
I can't.

29:32.471 --> 29:33.804
I have to focus. I'm sorry.

29:37.308 --> 29:38.308
My brother,

29:39.277 --> 29:40.344
the engineer.

29:42.914 --> 29:44.194
It's okay. I respect that.

29:45.416 --> 29:46.517
Enjoy the food.

29:56.494 --> 29:58.228
Hey, guys!

29:58.230 --> 29:59.830
Hey. Stay here.

30:03.369 --> 30:06.170
The rally is starting.
Everyone... Everyone's here.

30:06.172 --> 30:08.472
What? Come over,
show a little support.

30:08.474 --> 30:09.973
Yeah, it's not going
to change anything.

30:09.975 --> 30:11.255
That's where you're wrong.

30:13.511 --> 30:14.845
Come on.

30:15.313 --> 30:16.847
Good. Come on.

30:16.849 --> 30:20.484
- Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

30:20.486 --> 30:23.854
Mousavi! Mousavi! Mousavi!

30:23.856 --> 30:27.057
Mousavi! Mousavi! Mousavi!

30:27.059 --> 30:28.425
How are the rehearsals going?

30:28.427 --> 30:30.861
Uh, yeah, they're going okay.

30:30.863 --> 30:32.329
It's a little hard for everyone to
concentrate with the elections going on.

30:32.331 --> 30:34.431
Yeah. Well, you'll
be going to Paris,

30:34.433 --> 30:35.465
a freer man.

30:36.100 --> 30:37.267
Yeah.

30:37.269 --> 30:39.236
<i>Salaam. Salaam.</i> How are you?

30:40.905 --> 30:42.072
<i>Salaam.</i>

30:42.074 --> 30:44.034
You have come
from the rally, yes?

30:45.476 --> 30:47.344
Look, we're just
on our way home.

30:47.346 --> 30:49.147
Do you plan on voting
for Mousavi?

30:50.114 --> 30:51.081
Yes.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.653
That makes you a non-believer.

30:57.222 --> 30:58.856
We're going home.

30:58.858 --> 30:59.990
So you are married?

31:00.959 --> 31:02.192
How long has it been?

31:02.194 --> 31:04.875
- Please don't. -I'm
not talking to you.

31:05.296 --> 31:07.297
Do you kiss her?

31:07.299 --> 31:09.433
Tell me, how does she taste?

31:09.435 --> 31:12.236
- Hey.
- No, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.

31:12.238 --> 31:13.136
Look, we'll go. We'll go.

31:13.138 --> 31:14.404
No. You will stay.

31:16.474 --> 31:17.941
You look so innocent.

31:20.278 --> 31:23.547
How much does a whore
like you charge, huh?

31:26.618 --> 31:28.552
Tell me, is she worth it?

31:28.554 --> 31:31.221
- Naser!

31:32.491 --> 31:34.524
- Naser!
- Naser!

31:34.526 --> 31:36.360
Naser! No!

31:49.408 --> 31:51.942
Guys, guys...

31:51.944 --> 31:53.377
- Naser?
- Naser!

32:00.485 --> 32:01.445
How is he?

32:02.353 --> 32:03.474
He's going to be okay.

32:05.356 --> 32:06.556
He just got out of surgery,
and they say

32:06.558 --> 32:08.058
he's going to be okay.

32:12.597 --> 32:13.697
What did you do?

32:16.134 --> 32:17.100
What did we do?

32:18.970 --> 32:21.171
What did we do?
What did they do?

32:21.173 --> 32:23.240
But why would they do this?

32:23.242 --> 32:24.803
Because they're animals,
Mehran.

32:26.044 --> 32:27.284
We need to be more careful.

32:28.313 --> 32:29.246
We are careful.

32:53.705 --> 32:54.972
Mmm, you have it.

32:55.540 --> 32:57.140
Just let it go.

32:58.509 --> 33:00.589
Try not to think
about what happened.

36:13.471 --> 36:14.771
Elaheh.

36:16.274 --> 36:17.794
- Elaheh, come with me.
- No.

36:19.944 --> 36:21.178
Elaheh, come with me.

36:24.615 --> 36:26.055
- Elaheh.
- No!

36:27.452 --> 36:29.953
Look, it's okay.
I'm her friend, so...

36:29.955 --> 36:31.288
I'm her friend, too.

37:11.329 --> 37:12.569
Naser's fine, by the way.

37:17.368 --> 37:18.268
You know you're the best
dancer in the group.

37:18.970 --> 37:20.303
Nothing changes that.

37:22.473 --> 37:24.674
But you can't dance
if you're on heroin.

37:25.743 --> 37:27.703
What are you,
the morality police?

37:30.481 --> 37:31.648
I don't care if
it's right or wrong.

37:31.650 --> 37:32.930
All I care about is the group.

37:36.020 --> 37:37.854
What's the point?

37:37.856 --> 37:39.856
We both know
this isn't going anywhere.

37:40.992 --> 37:42.952
- That's not true.
- Then where is it going?

37:44.328 --> 37:45.762
Tell me, Afshin.

37:45.764 --> 37:46.885
What's the big plan?

38:23.067 --> 38:24.334
This isn't enough.

38:27.338 --> 38:28.459
We should perform,

38:30.007 --> 38:31.641
to an audience.

38:34.313 --> 38:36.713
Look, it's one thing for us to practice
in here, but what's the point?

38:36.715 --> 38:38.795
You know, why dance
if no one can see us?

38:39.083 --> 38:41.451
Because it's safe in here.

38:41.453 --> 38:42.419
Who'd want to see us?

38:43.754 --> 38:45.355
Anyone who wants to come.

38:45.357 --> 38:46.556
We'll find an audience.

38:46.558 --> 38:48.425
Anyone who wants
to be arrested.

38:48.427 --> 38:50.060
All right, all right.

38:50.062 --> 38:52.462
So where would we put on
a performance?

38:52.464 --> 38:54.831
There's nowhere. We can't.

38:54.833 --> 38:56.900
- Why not?
- It's too dangerous.

38:58.602 --> 39:00.203
What about somewhere
out of the city?

39:02.640 --> 39:03.606
Where?

39:08.045 --> 39:10.045
<i>When I first left</i>
<i>my family and came to Tehran,</i>

39:11.716 --> 39:12.996
<i>I drove through the desert.</i>

39:15.519 --> 39:18.421
Look. See?

39:18.423 --> 39:19.663
We can dance in the desert.

39:21.792 --> 39:22.913
Where there's no regime.

39:24.028 --> 39:25.268
Where no one can find us.

39:27.631 --> 39:29.065
Yes.

39:29.067 --> 39:30.188
You're absolutely right.

40:38.769 --> 40:39.736
You okay?

40:41.472 --> 40:42.472
Yeah. I'm fine.

40:44.642 --> 40:47.076
Don't worry about
your technique.

40:47.078 --> 40:49.158
You don't have
to think about it.

40:50.014 --> 40:52.014
Of course I do.
I mean, you taught me that.

40:54.785 --> 40:57.053
Afshin,

40:57.055 --> 41:00.457
you can spend your whole life
trying to perfect your technique,

41:00.459 --> 41:01.958
but you only make a difference

41:01.960 --> 41:03.960
when you find your own
secret language.

41:04.895 --> 41:06.775
That's when you start
communicating.

41:07.998 --> 41:09.566
Connecting.

41:12.770 --> 41:14.037
Dance can be anything.

41:14.039 --> 41:16.139
Just waving goodbye

41:16.141 --> 41:17.774
or kneeling down to pray.

41:19.743 --> 41:21.044
Or raising your fist in the air

41:21.046 --> 41:22.966
because you believe
in something.

41:25.249 --> 41:26.616
You taught me that.

42:48.098 --> 42:49.799
Uh, come in.

42:51.569 --> 42:52.669
Hmm.

42:59.143 --> 43:01.010
You made this?

43:01.012 --> 43:02.612
- Yeah

43:08.786 --> 43:10.853
I'm sorry.

43:29.974 --> 43:32.175
They closed the Ballet
after the revolution.

43:34.044 --> 43:37.246
Dance was my mother's life.

43:37.248 --> 43:40.168
You know, she was part of
the company for 10 years.

43:40.718 --> 43:41.884
This was her oxygen.

43:43.754 --> 43:45.634
She couldn't breathe
without it.

43:47.124 --> 43:49.164
And just like that,
she had to stop.

43:52.296 --> 43:54.964
The only way she could
keep going was to...

43:55.799 --> 43:56.899
Was to teach me.

43:58.268 --> 43:59.669
<i>At home.</i>

44:00.771 --> 44:01.892
<i>Behind closed curtains.</i>

44:03.874 --> 44:06.009
<i>Oh, she was very hard.</i>

44:06.011 --> 44:08.732
<i>Very hard. She pushed
me all the way.</i>

44:11.315 --> 44:13.075
But it wasn't enough for her.

44:15.753 --> 44:18.354
I mean,
I wasn't enough for her.

44:21.358 --> 44:22.659
So she got high.

44:24.128 --> 44:26.362
I just thought she was tired.

44:26.364 --> 44:28.698
I thought she was disappointed.

44:29.366 --> 44:30.800
But I didn't want that.

44:30.802 --> 44:32.035
I wanted to be like her.

44:34.271 --> 44:37.273
So I carried on and I...

44:37.275 --> 44:39.516
And I taught myself
on the days she wouldn't.

44:42.446 --> 44:43.846
Do you know, she...

44:45.149 --> 44:47.050
She always told me
that it was her dream

44:47.052 --> 44:48.292
to see me dance on a stage.

44:49.953 --> 44:51.020
Again and again.

44:53.057 --> 44:54.977
Even when she could
hardly speak.

44:59.029 --> 45:00.430
Then when I was 13...

45:02.333 --> 45:03.573
she took too much.

45:06.970 --> 45:08.905
After her funeral,
I went through her things

45:08.907 --> 45:10.940
and I... And I found her wraps.

45:15.446 --> 45:16.879
It stopped the pain.

45:19.416 --> 45:20.817
It still stops the pain.

45:23.187 --> 45:24.427
I don't want to be awake.

46:02.059 --> 46:03.140
We'll do this together.

47:15.299 --> 47:16.532
Elaheh.

49:07.144 --> 49:08.244
Afshin Ghaffarian.

49:08.246 --> 49:09.327
Back from the dead.

49:09.947 --> 49:11.047
How's things?

49:13.450 --> 49:15.170
So, Cyrus,
he told us about her.

49:17.421 --> 49:19.222
Yeah, well,
she's clean now, so...

49:19.389 --> 49:21.590
I don't care.

49:21.592 --> 49:23.259
Ardi, don't lose sight
of why we're doing this.

49:23.261 --> 49:25.661
Don't you dare tell me that.

49:25.663 --> 49:28.103
We haven't seen you for weeks.
Have you been to see Naser?

49:30.200 --> 49:32.320
Afshin, you've forgotten
who your friends are.

49:33.971 --> 49:35.211
The last time we saw you,

49:36.206 --> 49:37.673
you had this great idea,

49:38.608 --> 49:39.689
and we believed in you.

49:42.347 --> 49:43.627
Don't make this about her.

49:46.350 --> 49:47.383
I am here today

49:48.452 --> 49:50.252
to talk to you

49:50.254 --> 49:53.322
about something very
important for our country.

49:54.458 --> 49:56.592
Thirty years ago,

49:56.594 --> 49:58.127
this country was in chaos.

49:59.496 --> 50:01.497
A corrupt leader.

50:01.499 --> 50:04.500
A government oblivious
to the needs of its people.

50:06.203 --> 50:07.443
Then the revolution came.

50:08.472 --> 50:10.139
The whole country rose up.

50:11.008 --> 50:12.041
And we were one.

50:13.310 --> 50:15.144
And we changed history.

50:15.146 --> 50:16.645
You were right what you said.

50:16.647 --> 50:19.749
- But the fight goes on.
- I'm sorry.

50:19.751 --> 50:23.285
And now our enemy
comes from within.

50:23.287 --> 50:25.221
- In these elections... -Let's
get out of here, shall we?

50:25.223 --> 50:27.009
There are people who
want to divide us...

50:27.035 --> 50:27.723
Hey, come on.

50:27.725 --> 50:29.425
Weaken us.

50:29.427 --> 50:32.094
This is what we fight against.

50:37.467 --> 50:39.301
<i>Okay, so we</i>
<i>only ask people that we trust?</i>

50:40.170 --> 50:41.537
Who do we trust?

50:41.539 --> 50:43.672
That's up to us.

50:43.674 --> 50:46.375
Wow, this is where things

50:46.377 --> 50:49.045
get really dangerous, isn't it?

50:49.047 --> 50:51.580
Do you realize what will happen
if we get caught doing this?

50:51.582 --> 50:54.316
- Of course we do, Mona.
- Really?

50:54.318 --> 50:56.452
Because if you did,
you'd be scared.

50:56.454 --> 50:58.587
And I don't hear any
fear in your voice.

50:58.589 --> 51:00.389
We're all scared.

51:00.391 --> 51:03.626
- We talked about this.
- Yes, but doing this in here

51:03.628 --> 51:05.394
is one thing,
putting on a performance

51:05.396 --> 51:06.595
- out there is...
- She's backing out.

51:06.597 --> 51:08.697
Shut up.

51:08.699 --> 51:11.233
You're too high to have
any idea what's going on.

51:11.235 --> 51:13.102
No, you don't know
anything about me.

51:13.104 --> 51:15.604
- This isn't about you!
- Don't talk to me like that.

51:15.606 --> 51:16.739
Look, do you...

51:16.741 --> 51:18.607
Do you have any idea

51:18.609 --> 51:20.543
- what she's been through
the last three weeks? Ardi.

51:20.545 --> 51:22.522
What it means for her
to be in this room...

51:22.548 --> 51:23.646
Guys, can we just...

51:23.648 --> 51:24.814
Look, let's just
start the rehearsal.

51:24.816 --> 51:26.782
No!

51:29.619 --> 51:31.120
Look what they did to Naser.

51:33.156 --> 51:35.091
It's going to be worse for us.

51:37.394 --> 51:38.475
We can't do this.

51:40.430 --> 51:43.299
I can't.

51:43.301 --> 51:44.941
- I'm sorry. I have to go.
- Please, Mona.

51:45.335 --> 51:46.502
Mona.

51:46.504 --> 51:47.503
Mona, please.

51:48.405 --> 51:49.772
Please don't.

52:01.351 --> 52:02.718
This is a big deal for her.

52:02.720 --> 52:04.854
Ardi, enough. Enough.

52:04.856 --> 52:06.689
- Enough.
- What did I say?

52:06.691 --> 52:08.757
What's wrong with you?
- I was just being honest.

52:08.759 --> 52:10.719
You did say something.
- I was just being honest.

52:15.298 --> 52:16.532
Come on, let's start.

52:16.534 --> 52:18.267
- What?
- Let's start the rehearsal.

52:20.837 --> 52:23.339
We started this because we
wanted to take control,

52:23.341 --> 52:25.441
you know, feel free.

52:25.443 --> 52:26.364
Now look at us.

52:28.612 --> 52:31.452
The regime, you know, the
Basij, they're strangling us.

52:32.682 --> 52:34.283
And we're suffocating.

52:36.453 --> 52:37.820
You know, we can go
out to the desert.

52:37.822 --> 52:39.782
We can feel what it's like
to breathe.

52:40.824 --> 52:42.791
You know, just for a few hours.
Just for a moment even.

52:42.793 --> 52:43.926
That's all I want.

52:46.530 --> 52:48.530
And that's what
the story is about.

53:04.848 --> 53:06.315
Those people...

53:07.317 --> 53:08.617
They are your friends?

53:10.554 --> 53:11.520
Yes.

53:13.456 --> 53:14.657
They look like trouble.

53:17.494 --> 53:20.296
I thought I'd come and help
you with your coursework.

53:21.198 --> 53:22.264
Now...

53:22.266 --> 53:24.333
I'm no engineer, but, uh...

53:25.702 --> 53:28.404
I'm pretty sure this isn't how
you build a bridge.

53:33.343 --> 53:35.678
Okay.

53:35.680 --> 53:37.800
We've got 20 people
signed up to come.

53:38.381 --> 53:41.684
That's 20 people outside
this room that know.

53:41.686 --> 53:43.819
<i>So, this is how</i>
<i>we keep it safe.</i>

53:43.821 --> 53:46.221
Only I will know the exact
location of the dance.

53:51.861 --> 53:54.730
Ardi, when you
pick up the audience,

53:54.732 --> 53:58.212
I'll tell you where it is an hour
into your drive south on the freeway.

54:02.272 --> 54:03.272
<i>This is ours.</i>

54:04.407 --> 54:06.442
<i>If we stop, if we hide,</i>

54:06.444 --> 54:08.577
if we change...

54:08.579 --> 54:09.500
They win.

56:06.563 --> 56:07.523
It's just up over there.

56:09.866 --> 56:12.547
Where are we, about a hundred
kilometers south of Tehran?

56:15.138 --> 56:16.839
Yeah.
Think it's far enough away?

56:18.775 --> 56:19.675
Should be.

56:29.552 --> 56:30.652
Get in.

56:33.656 --> 56:35.057
Let's do it.

57:16.634 --> 57:17.666
- Okay, let's go.

57:32.749 --> 57:33.870
You shouldn't be so nervous.

57:34.551 --> 57:35.632
It's going to be great.

57:36.886 --> 57:38.220
Of course. Hey...

57:42.058 --> 57:43.225
Thanks.

58:09.719 --> 58:10.586
Elaheh.

58:29.873 --> 58:30.739
Afshin.

58:33.243 --> 58:34.576
Afshin.

58:37.213 --> 58:38.647
Afshin.

58:41.251 --> 58:42.651
Afshin, please.

58:47.190 --> 58:48.590
Hey!

58:49.893 --> 58:50.959
Afshin!

59:00.870 --> 59:02.571
Guys, sit down. Sit down.

59:02.573 --> 59:04.072
I promise you it's worth it.

59:04.074 --> 59:05.954
I promise.
I hope you like the show.

01:09:53.856 --> 01:09:56.324
<i>These have been</i>
<i>amazing times in Iran.</i>

01:09:56.326 --> 01:09:58.293
<i>The government</i>
<i>has just announced that.</i>

01:09:58.295 --> 01:09:59.894
<i>President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</i>

01:09:59.896 --> 01:10:03.865
<i>has been reelected</i>
<i>with 62.6% of the vote.</i>

01:10:03.867 --> 01:10:07.936
<i>The challenger, Mir-Hossein
Mousavi, got 33.7%.</i>

01:10:07.938 --> 01:10:10.605
<i>That seems strange.</i>

01:10:10.607 --> 01:10:13.541
<i>In fact, it is my own sense that the
vote appears to have been rigged.</i>

01:10:13.543 --> 01:10:15.610
<i>Mousavi had been</i>
<i>drawing huge crowds,</i>

01:10:15.612 --> 01:10:18.479
<i>generating greater</i>
<i>and greater enthusiasm,</i>

01:10:18.481 --> 01:10:20.949
<i>and getting bolder and bolder</i>
<i>in his criticism</i>

01:10:20.951 --> 01:10:23.351
<i>of Ahmadinejad and the regime.</i>

01:10:23.353 --> 01:10:25.453
Where is our vote?

01:10:25.455 --> 01:10:29.657
Where is our vote? Where is our vote?
Where is our vote?

01:10:29.659 --> 01:10:32.660
Where is our vote?
Where is our vote?

01:10:32.662 --> 01:10:35.863
Where is our vote?
Where is our vote?

01:10:35.865 --> 01:10:37.966
Where is our vote?

01:10:37.968 --> 01:10:42.437
Where is our vote? Where is our vote?
Where is our vote?

01:10:42.439 --> 01:10:46.741
Where is our vote? Where is our vote?
Where is our vote?

01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:48.543
Where is our vote?

01:10:54.817 --> 01:10:55.917
What happened?

01:10:57.653 --> 01:10:58.920
Uh, I'm going home.

01:10:59.855 --> 01:11:01.389
My family wants me back.

01:11:03.525 --> 01:11:05.393
Hey, who did this to you?

01:11:07.463 --> 01:11:09.964
My brother is Basij.

01:11:09.966 --> 01:11:11.432
He wanted me to betray you.

01:11:12.034 --> 01:11:13.768
But I couldn't.

01:11:15.037 --> 01:11:16.971
We were free

01:11:16.973 --> 01:11:19.374
in the desert,
just for that moment.

01:11:21.610 --> 01:11:22.777
I couldn't destroy that.

01:11:25.748 --> 01:11:26.869
And I'll always have it.

01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:32.553
Mousavi! Mousavi!

01:11:32.555 --> 01:11:36.824
Mousavi! Mousavi!
Mousavi! Mousavi!

01:11:36.826 --> 01:11:38.993
Mousavi! Mousavi!

01:11:38.995 --> 01:11:41.329
Mir-Hossein! Ya Hossein!

01:11:41.331 --> 01:11:43.498
Mir-Hossein! Ya Hossein!

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.533
Mir-Hossein! Ya Hossein!

01:11:45.535 --> 01:11:47.535
Mir-Hossein! Ya Hossein!

01:11:47.537 --> 01:11:49.671
Ya Hossein! Mir-Hossein!

01:11:49.673 --> 01:11:53.608
Ya Hossein! Mir-Hossein!
Ya Hossein! Mir-Hossein!

01:12:15.364 --> 01:12:16.764
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:12:18.368 --> 01:12:20.501
Afshin! Afshin!

01:12:25.541 --> 01:12:27.061
- Afshin!
- Ardi!

01:12:28.377 --> 01:12:29.477
Ardi!

01:13:26.034 --> 01:13:28.136
Hey! Hey!

01:13:53.762 --> 01:13:55.029
Him.

01:13:55.031 --> 01:13:56.063
I did nothing!

01:13:57.933 --> 01:14:00.201
- I'm sorry! -You want to know
where your vote is, huh?

01:14:00.203 --> 01:14:01.436
I'm sorry!

01:14:01.438 --> 01:14:03.070
Here is your vote.

01:14:17.853 --> 01:14:19.086
Get me their wallets.

01:14:27.062 --> 01:14:28.563
The Saba Art Center.

01:14:30.799 --> 01:14:32.233
Who is Afshin Ghaffarian?

01:14:36.171 --> 01:14:38.139
Afshin Ghaffarian.

01:14:40.175 --> 01:14:42.977
If Afshin Ghaffarian does
not make himself known,

01:14:42.979 --> 01:14:46.080
we will go to Mashhad
and find his family.

01:14:46.082 --> 01:14:47.915
I'm Afshin.

01:14:57.193 --> 01:14:58.274
So you are an artist.

01:15:03.065 --> 01:15:05.199
Beat him... artistically.

01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:22.683
Get him up.

01:15:32.528 --> 01:15:35.596
Our Islamic Republic
is a shining sun,

01:15:37.266 --> 01:15:39.534
and you

01:15:39.536 --> 01:15:41.969
threw dust towards the sun.

01:15:43.071 --> 01:15:44.171
But the dust

01:15:45.874 --> 01:15:47.708
will now return to your eyes.

01:16:03.793 --> 01:16:05.560
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:16:12.035 --> 01:16:12.900
Hey!

01:16:13.936 --> 01:16:15.017
Stay here with these!

01:16:23.145 --> 01:16:25.346
We will find you,
Afshin Ghaffarian!

01:16:26.782 --> 01:16:28.616
You are a dead man!

01:17:40.222 --> 01:17:41.656
Elaheh.

01:17:58.106 --> 01:18:00.408
- What are you gonna do?

01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:02.810
By tomorrow, there will be
checkpoints on every corner.

01:18:02.812 --> 01:18:03.978
Lie low.

01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:05.446
For how long?

01:18:05.448 --> 01:18:07.314
As long as it takes.

01:18:07.316 --> 01:18:09.116
Afshin, if they know your
name, they will find you.

01:18:09.118 --> 01:18:10.284
I know, Naser!

01:18:22.464 --> 01:18:23.731
Hey.

01:18:25.834 --> 01:18:27.168
You can't sleep, either, huh?

01:18:27.170 --> 01:18:29.303
Oh, I, uh...

01:18:29.305 --> 01:18:31.806
Haven't really been able
to sleep since the attack.

01:18:31.808 --> 01:18:33.841
I keep getting
these nightmares.

01:18:33.843 --> 01:18:37.011
If their plan was to scare the
shit out of me, it worked.

01:18:38.414 --> 01:18:40.534
Hey, Mona told me
about the dance.

01:18:41.149 --> 01:18:42.349
I'm really glad you did it.

01:18:42.351 --> 01:18:44.251
Thanks.

01:18:44.253 --> 01:18:46.253
And it's good
you're acting again, too.

01:18:50.459 --> 01:18:51.992
I don't want to go, Afshin.

01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:54.762
To Paris.

01:18:55.997 --> 01:18:57.865
I can't leave Mona. Not now.

01:18:57.867 --> 01:18:59.200
Not while this is happening.

01:19:00.268 --> 01:19:01.469
I love her.

01:19:06.007 --> 01:19:07.074
You could go.

01:19:08.343 --> 01:19:09.844
What?

01:19:09.846 --> 01:19:11.766
Take my part in the play.

01:19:12.814 --> 01:19:15.082
You're the director, Naser.

01:19:15.084 --> 01:19:16.250
They'd never let me go
instead of you.

01:19:16.252 --> 01:19:19.320
No, I mean, you go as me.

01:19:19.322 --> 01:19:20.562
My passport can be fixed.

01:19:22.124 --> 01:19:24.191
Afshin, you can't stay here,
they'll kill you.

01:19:24.193 --> 01:19:26.861
- You're not thinking straight.
- Look, I mean it, Afshin. Go.

01:19:26.863 --> 01:19:27.984
And don't come back.

01:19:28.463 --> 01:19:29.797
There's just no way.

01:19:31.466 --> 01:19:32.767
You know, I can't.

01:19:34.069 --> 01:19:35.136
Why, Afshin?

01:19:36.238 --> 01:19:37.371
Why can't you go?

01:19:50.185 --> 01:19:52.265
You're a beautiful dancer,
you know that?

01:19:53.488 --> 01:19:54.922
Don't ever give it up.

01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:00.100
Don't let anyone stop you.

01:20:01.196 --> 01:20:02.263
Not even me.

01:20:04.099 --> 01:20:05.299
Go to Paris, Afshin.

01:20:07.169 --> 01:20:08.169
For both of us.

01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:17.471
You know, when I first
saw a piece of ballet...

01:20:18.914 --> 01:20:21.348
I didn't understand it.
You know, I couldn't see

01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:23.317
how it worked.

01:20:23.319 --> 01:20:26.487
Then a friend of mine
told me a line from a poem.

01:20:27.889 --> 01:20:28.923
It was by Rumi.

01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:34.020
"In your light,
I learned how to love."

01:20:35.230 --> 01:20:37.110
"In your beauty,
I found poetry."

01:20:40.468 --> 01:20:42.169
"You danced inside my heart,"

01:20:42.171 --> 01:20:44.211
"where no one else
can see you."

01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:50.077
Just go.

01:21:09.198 --> 01:21:10.878
What was the name
of that play again?

01:21:11.466 --> 01:21:13.234
Uh, <i> The Tempest.</i>

01:21:15.904 --> 01:21:17.538
And you're sure this can work?

01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:19.106
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'm sure.

01:21:20.308 --> 01:21:22.348
And I've already spoken
to the other actors.

01:21:23.211 --> 01:21:24.332
They're coming over tonight.

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:26.447
How come?

01:21:26.449 --> 01:21:27.409
Rehearsal.

01:21:36.057 --> 01:21:37.898
Afshin's taking
Naser's place in Paris.

01:21:39.261 --> 01:21:40.227
He's leaving.

01:21:56.544 --> 01:21:59.513
I was just, uh, coming around
to get some stuff for the...

01:21:59.515 --> 01:22:00.948
Stuff for the rally.

01:22:04.352 --> 01:22:05.586
Ardi.

01:22:07.989 --> 01:22:10.109
You know, I know
you've got to go.

01:22:13.929 --> 01:22:15.010
See you around, Afshin.

01:23:22.664 --> 01:23:24.431
- Hey.
<i>- Salaam.</i>

01:23:25.633 --> 01:23:27.313
<i>- Salaam.</i>
<i>- Salaam.</i>

01:23:29.137 --> 01:23:30.218
You have your passport?

01:23:30.472 --> 01:23:31.572
Yeah.

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:33.707
Your ticket.

01:23:35.744 --> 01:23:37.644
While you're on this trip,

01:23:37.646 --> 01:23:40.781
you are representing The Islamic
Republic of Iran. You understand?

01:23:42.183 --> 01:23:44.118
Of course. We all do.

01:23:45.353 --> 01:23:46.553
Good.

01:23:50.158 --> 01:23:52.793
Babysitters from
the Ministry of Culture.

01:23:52.795 --> 01:23:55.429
Don't mind them... Naser.

01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:01.135
Naser Javadi.

01:24:01.803 --> 01:24:03.203
Where are you going?

01:24:03.772 --> 01:24:05.339
To Paris.

01:24:05.341 --> 01:24:07.574
What is the purpose
of your trip?

01:24:07.576 --> 01:24:10.177
It's a theater festival, um,
arranged by the university.

01:24:10.612 --> 01:24:13.047
You're a drama student?

01:24:13.049 --> 01:24:14.729
Yeah, I'm the student director.

01:24:23.391 --> 01:24:24.631
What is your date of birth?

01:24:28.363 --> 01:24:31.165
Uh, the 23rd of August, 1985.

01:24:47.715 --> 01:24:49.349
Yeah. Okay.

01:26:52.907 --> 01:26:55.842
Drink water, not a drop before.

01:26:55.844 --> 01:26:57.678
Therefore, drink to me.

01:26:57.680 --> 01:26:59.713
- Yes?
- Yes, and then,

01:26:59.715 --> 01:27:02.883
"They say... They say there's
five upon this isle,

01:27:02.885 --> 01:27:05.485
- "we are three of them."
Servant-monster, drink to me.

01:27:06.621 --> 01:27:08.488
The folly...

01:27:08.490 --> 01:27:09.571
The folly of this island...

01:27:25.773 --> 01:27:26.740
Afshin?

01:27:28.776 --> 01:27:29.910
Afshin?

01:27:32.747 --> 01:27:33.914
Mehdi?

01:27:37.685 --> 01:27:39.286
Ah, it's you.

01:27:39.288 --> 01:27:40.487
What are you doing here?

01:27:40.489 --> 01:27:41.521
I live here.

01:27:42.757 --> 01:27:44.358
Why? I mean, what happened?

01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:49.730
They shut down the Saba.
Life wasn't the same for me.

01:27:49.732 --> 01:27:51.632
It was better for me to leave.

01:27:51.634 --> 01:27:55.569
Besides, where did Nureyev go
when he fled Russia?

01:27:55.571 --> 01:27:57.437
Yeah, Paris.

01:27:57.439 --> 01:27:58.705
- Exactly.

01:28:01.442 --> 01:28:02.542
Mehdi...

01:28:04.545 --> 01:28:05.679
I'm in a lot of trouble.

01:28:06.981 --> 01:28:09.750
Drink, servant-monster,
when I bid thee.

01:28:09.752 --> 01:28:12.753
Thy eyes are
almost in thy head.

01:28:12.755 --> 01:28:14.488
Where should they be set else?

01:28:14.490 --> 01:28:18.325
He were a brave monster indeed,
if they were set in his tail.

01:28:18.327 --> 01:28:22.562
My man-monster hath drowned
his tongue in sack.

01:28:22.564 --> 01:28:25.365
For my part, the sea
cannot drown me.

01:28:25.367 --> 01:28:28.769
I swam, ere I could
recover the shore,

01:28:28.771 --> 01:28:30.704
five-and-thirty leagues...

01:28:31.873 --> 01:28:33.907
Off and on.

01:28:33.909 --> 01:28:39.346
By this light, thou shalt be my
lieutenant, monster, or my standard.

01:28:39.348 --> 01:28:41.315
Uh, your lieutenant,
if you list.

01:28:41.317 --> 01:28:42.883
He's no standard.

01:28:42.885 --> 01:28:43.845
We'll not run...

01:29:22.824 --> 01:29:25.892
Monster, I say speak.

01:29:44.045 --> 01:29:45.965
My name is Afshin Ghaffarian.

01:29:46.614 --> 01:29:47.814
I'm a citizen of Iran.

01:29:48.983 --> 01:29:51.818
I'm a dancer,

01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:54.581
and my government won't
let its people be free.

01:29:55.156 --> 01:29:56.997
In my country,
even dance is forbidden.

01:30:04.732 --> 01:30:05.813
I want my rights.

01:30:07.435 --> 01:30:09.069
I want my freedom.

01:30:09.071 --> 01:30:11.705
Thou liest,
most ignorant mon...

01:30:11.707 --> 01:30:13.308
My name is Afshin Ghaffarian!

01:30:16.778 --> 01:30:18.078
I'm...

01:30:27.755 --> 01:30:30.757
<i>Afshin, dance can be anything,</i>

01:30:31.959 --> 01:30:33.827
<i>even raising your fist</i>
<i>in the air</i>

01:30:33.829 --> 01:30:35.829
<i>because you believe</i>
<i>in something.</i>

01:30:47.809 --> 01:30:49.843
My name is Afshin Ghaffarian,

01:30:51.579 --> 01:30:52.539
and I'm a...

01:31:01.689 --> 01:31:02.610
I'm a dancer.

01:31:07.061 --> 01:31:09.463
But my government
won't let its people be...

01:31:23.744 --> 01:31:24.911
free.

01:33:08.983 --> 01:33:10.183
Hey!

01:33:11.919 --> 01:33:13.119
Hey!

01:33:16.257 --> 01:33:18.191
Hey!

01:33:30.705 --> 01:33:32.939
Please, please, please.

01:33:56.063 --> 01:33:57.130
Shut it down.

01:34:20.656 --> 01:34:21.655
You are dead.

01:34:41.375 --> 01:34:42.776
Let's go.

01:38:20.961 --> 01:38:24.330
In the morning,
the early morning, at 6:00,

01:38:24.332 --> 01:38:26.466
in, uh, October...

01:38:27.234 --> 01:38:29.369
11th of October,

01:38:29.371 --> 01:38:31.437
I leave Iran.

01:38:31.439 --> 01:38:34.007
I get into the plane,

01:38:34.009 --> 01:38:36.576
and I remember I saw the...

01:38:36.578 --> 01:38:39.012
The airport, Tehran Airport.

01:38:39.014 --> 01:38:41.648
The last time
I was looking around,

01:38:41.650 --> 01:38:44.484
and the plane, uh,

01:38:44.486 --> 01:38:45.652
started to go.

01:38:45.654 --> 01:38:48.187
To take off.

01:38:48.189 --> 01:38:51.024
I was take off from Tehran.
I was take off from Iran.
