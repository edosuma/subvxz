hey, did anybody see
the sports section?

01:00.693 --> 01:02.894
Oh, daddy probably took it
with him this morning.

01:02.962 --> 01:06.131
Took it where?
In the cab.
He's moonlighting again.

01:06.198 --> 01:08.299
"Moonlighting."
Tsk.

01:08.367 --> 01:11.870
That sounds so much more
romantic than saying,

01:11.937 --> 01:14.105
"he's driving
Mr. munson's cab...

01:14.173 --> 01:17.175
To pick up a few
extra bucks."

01:22.014 --> 01:25.516
Gee, thanks for
the big hello.
Hi, daddy.

01:25.584 --> 01:28.419
[ Edith ] Hello, Archie.
Hey, arch, where's
the sports section?

01:28.487 --> 01:31.455
Oh, beautiful, beautiful.
Listen to that, huh?

01:31.523 --> 01:34.893
I'm out hacking around
this town, doing two jobs,

01:34.960 --> 01:37.495
the meathead sits here
on his butt,

01:37.563 --> 01:40.298
says to me, "where's
the sports section?"

01:40.365 --> 01:42.633
Get out of the chair!

01:44.904 --> 01:46.838
And, Edith,

01:46.906 --> 01:50.274
suppose there's any chance
of having a cup of coffee
over here, huh?

01:50.342 --> 01:53.578
Oh, sure, Archie.
How was your day?

01:53.645 --> 01:55.947
Oh, like lots
of days, Edith:

01:56.015 --> 01:57.949
Lousy.

01:58.017 --> 02:00.151
Except for one little
bright spot that made
the day...

02:00.219 --> 02:02.220
What you might call
fascinating.

02:02.287 --> 02:06.257
- "Fascinating"?
- What's the matter?
Don't you like that word?

02:07.526 --> 02:10.294
Guess what famous
and important
personality...

02:10.362 --> 02:12.663
I carried as a passenger
in my cab today?

02:12.732 --> 02:16.467
- Oh, tell us!
- Oh, no, no. You ain't gonna
get it out of me that easy.

02:16.535 --> 02:18.603
Come on. You gotta
guess for this one.

02:18.670 --> 02:21.740
All right. Let's try.
I'll go first.

02:21.807 --> 02:23.808
Living or dead?

02:32.684 --> 02:36.287
I was driving a cab, Edith,
not a hearse.

02:36.355 --> 02:38.790
Go back to
your solitaire, huh?

02:38.858 --> 02:41.126
Give us a hint, daddy.
Is he in show business?

02:41.193 --> 02:43.361
Bingo.
Give you another hint.

02:43.428 --> 02:45.496
"Bongo, bongo, bongo."

02:45.564 --> 02:48.399
Well, he's either desi arnaz
or, knowing you,

02:48.467 --> 02:50.468
he's probably black.

02:51.536 --> 02:53.638
Right.

02:53.705 --> 02:56.707
Black as the ace of spades.

02:56.776 --> 03:01.312
In fact, as far as I'm
concerned, this guy <i>is</i>
<i>the ace of spades.</i>

03:02.648 --> 03:05.349
For goodness sakes.
Archie!

03:05.417 --> 03:10.588
You just said "ace of spades"
and I turned up
the ace of spades.

03:10.656 --> 03:13.124
You see that in the movies,
and you say,

03:13.192 --> 03:15.894
"that wouldn't happen
in real life."

03:15.961 --> 03:20.064
But here we are
in real life,
and it happened.

03:21.700 --> 03:25.804
We're in real life
over here, Edith.
Would you care to join us?

03:27.706 --> 03:30.775
Was it flip Wilson?
No, no, no.

03:30.843 --> 03:32.443
Belafonte?

03:32.511 --> 03:36.347
No, I said black, meathead.
Harvey Belafonte ain't black.

03:39.885 --> 03:42.720
He's just a good-looking
white guy dipped in caramel.

03:51.630 --> 03:53.698
I'll give youse
one more hint,
and that's all.

03:53.765 --> 03:55.666
You ready?

03:55.734 --> 03:57.668
¶ Hey, there ¶

03:57.736 --> 04:01.239

in your eyes ¶

04:02.241 --> 04:05.109
Rosemary clooney is black?

04:07.847 --> 04:11.115
Daddy, you had
Sammy Davis Jr.
in your cab?

04:11.183 --> 04:13.251
As sure as you're
sitting there.

04:13.319 --> 04:16.754
Could you give us
just one more hint?

04:17.957 --> 04:20.959
Could you just play cards
with yourself?

04:21.026 --> 04:23.194
Arch, are you sure
it was Sammy Davis Jr.?

04:23.262 --> 04:26.030
No, meathead.
It was some zulu jockey.

04:27.266 --> 04:29.700
I know the man.
Besides, who would give me...

04:29.768 --> 04:33.137
A five-buck tip
for a buck-and-a-quarter
haul, anyway?

04:33.205 --> 04:35.639
And as fine a gentleman
as ever you'd want to meet.

04:35.707 --> 04:39.010
Sat in the back of the cab,
talked to be about the weather,
all kinds of things,

04:39.078 --> 04:41.312
just like a regular person.

04:44.149 --> 04:47.651
Fact, if it weren't for
the rearview mirror there, I'd
have thought he was a white guy.

04:47.719 --> 04:50.454
Arch! Why do you got to say
things like that for?

04:50.522 --> 04:54.092
What do you mean, "why do I got
to say things like that for"?
What did I say, anyhow?

04:54.159 --> 04:56.895
Would you listen to these two?
You can't say
nothin' around here.

04:56.962 --> 04:59.264
They twist around
everything you say.

04:59.331 --> 05:02.967
Oh, Edith. You know what?
I gave him our names
and address...

05:03.035 --> 05:05.503
So he can send us
an autographed picture
of himself.

05:05.570 --> 05:07.705
Sammy Davis Jr.?
<i>Yeah.</i>

05:07.773 --> 05:09.941
Oh, that's wonderful!

05:10.009 --> 05:12.476
Did you tell him
how much I like him?

05:12.544 --> 05:16.247
Oh, sure, Edith.
That was the first thing
I said to him.

05:16.315 --> 05:19.384
Oh, I said, "Sam,
you don't have to worry
none about your career...

05:19.451 --> 05:23.288
'Cause Edith bunker
is right behind you."

05:23.355 --> 05:25.890
I bet he was glad
to hear that.

05:25.958 --> 05:28.759
<i>[ Phone ringing ]</i>

05:28.827 --> 05:30.761
Hello.

05:32.798 --> 05:34.966
Who is this?

05:35.034 --> 05:36.968
Huh?

05:37.036 --> 05:40.238
Uh, hold the phone, will you?
Hold the phone just a minute.

05:40.306 --> 05:42.540
You know who I was just
talking about right here?

05:42.607 --> 05:45.843
I was just talking about
Sammy Davis Jr., right?
He's on the telephone right now!

05:45.911 --> 05:48.179
Daddy!
He's on the telephone?

05:48.247 --> 05:51.916
He is! Shh!
Tell him I'm still
behind him.

05:54.353 --> 05:57.055
Will you leave me alone?

05:57.122 --> 05:59.623
Uh, hello, Mr. Davis.
I'm sorry there,

05:59.691 --> 06:02.660
but I was just a little startled
about being called out of
the ordinary that way.

06:02.727 --> 06:05.129
Yeah.
What can I do for you?

06:06.398 --> 06:09.567
Oh, that fancy briefcase
was yours, huh?

06:09.634 --> 06:13.804
Well, listen, I turned it in
at the cab office there.

06:13.872 --> 06:17.675
Oh, geez, had all your important
contracts and everything
in there, huh?

06:17.742 --> 06:21.145
Well, how could I help you
get it back?

06:21.213 --> 06:24.382
Well, no, no, wait a minute.
You say you're going out
to the airport.

06:24.450 --> 06:28.186
That's good, because I can
have the briefcase delivered
here from the cab office,

06:28.253 --> 06:30.989
and my house is
kind of on the way,
off northern boulevard there.

06:31.056 --> 06:33.958
You can stop by here
and pick it up.

06:34.026 --> 06:37.996
You want to do that?
Huh? Hey!

06:38.063 --> 06:40.531
No, it'll be an honor,
Mr. Davis. Certainly.

06:40.599 --> 06:42.533
704 hauser street.

06:42.601 --> 06:45.536
Yeah. Yes, sir, Mr. Davis.
Yes, sir, Mr. Davis.

06:45.604 --> 06:47.938
Yeah. Good-bye.
He's coming over here.

06:48.007 --> 06:50.741
[ All shouting ]

06:50.809 --> 06:53.244
He's coming over here.
Put a lid on it!

06:55.147 --> 06:58.049
He traced me from the address
I give him to send us
the picture.

06:58.117 --> 07:00.284
You know where
he was calling us from?
No. Where?

07:00.352 --> 07:04.288
A car. That's right.
He's in a limousine right now
with a phone in it.

07:04.356 --> 07:07.958
Oh, I want to tell you,
some of these coloreds
are real classy.

07:08.027 --> 07:10.495
When they've got it,
they spend it.

07:10.562 --> 07:13.097
I've got to call
munson right now.
I got to go fix my face!

07:13.165 --> 07:16.100
Arch, what do you mean,
"some of these coloreds
are classy"?

07:16.168 --> 07:18.669
Why do you always have
to label black people
this or that?

07:18.737 --> 07:23.508
Because when they deserve
a compliment once in a while,
I don't hold it back.

07:25.411 --> 07:28.479
Now will you get
away from me?
[ Gibberish ]

07:28.547 --> 07:31.149
This and that.
Dummy up.

07:31.216 --> 07:34.385
Uh, munson,
Archie bunker here.

07:34.453 --> 07:38.622
Hey, that fancy leather
suitcase I turned in--

07:38.690 --> 07:41.859
yeah, well, I'm just
on the phone with the owner now,

07:41.927 --> 07:44.195
and I've arranged that
he's gonna pick it up
here at the house,

07:44.263 --> 07:46.431
so could you
bring it over?

07:46.498 --> 07:50.234
No, no. We don't want to
do that, munson, because this
is a very, very important guy.

07:50.302 --> 07:52.870
I mean, a biggie.
Yeah.

07:52.938 --> 07:55.273
Oh, you'll find out
when you get here.

07:55.340 --> 07:58.676
Bring it over, though, huh?
Good. Good. Great. Bye.

07:58.743 --> 08:01.446
Okay, it's all set,
it's all set.
Now, Edith, please.

08:01.513 --> 08:04.748
Don't go blabbing all over
the neighborhood that
Sammy Davis Jr.'s coming here.

08:04.816 --> 08:06.917
The house is gonna be
a mob scene.
All right, Archie.

08:06.985 --> 08:08.919
And don't say nothing
to Lionel about this.

08:08.987 --> 08:11.021
If he finds out,
he'll jump on his tom-tom.

08:11.090 --> 08:14.192
Before you know it,
we'll be up to our armpits
in jungle bunnies.

08:16.861 --> 08:19.730
Arch, when Sammy Davis
gets here, you gonna
call him a jungle bunny?

08:19.798 --> 08:24.569
Of course not, you dumbbell.
I'm gonna call him Mr. Davis.

08:24.636 --> 08:27.205
Just a minute ago he was
the ace of spades.
Now he's Mr. Davis?

08:27.272 --> 08:31.175
Because he worked himself up
to being called Mr. Davis,
and he deserves that,

08:31.243 --> 08:34.945
because in this great country,
a man can overcome
the unequalness of his color...

08:35.013 --> 08:37.181
And rise to become
a great star.

08:38.549 --> 08:40.485
Arch, what do you mean,
"unequalness"?

08:40.552 --> 08:44.188
What's the difference between
our neighbor Lionel Jefferson
and Sammy Davis Jr.?

08:44.256 --> 08:46.957
Ten million dollars
and five purple Cadillacs.

08:49.194 --> 08:51.362
Yeah. Bye-bye.

08:51.430 --> 08:53.831
Wait a minute.
Who were you
just calling here?

08:53.898 --> 08:58.068
Mabel Hefner.
She ain't never seen
a star up close.

08:58.137 --> 09:00.671
Well, she ain't
gonna see one.
Not in this house.

09:00.739 --> 09:03.307
You get on the blower
and tell her, "April fool."

09:03.375 --> 09:05.443
I can't.
She ain't home.

09:05.511 --> 09:07.745
Well, who was you
just talking to here?

09:07.812 --> 09:09.747
Her husband, Barney Hefner.

09:09.814 --> 09:13.551
Oh, Barney the bonehead.
Oh, he won't tell
nobody.

09:13.619 --> 09:16.120
All right, Edith.
All right.
What's done is done.

09:16.188 --> 09:18.689
But just do this
for me, huh? A favor.

09:18.757 --> 09:21.959
When Sammy Davis Jr.
gets here, whatever else
you blab about,

09:22.027 --> 09:25.163
don't say nothing
about his eye, huh?
What eye?

09:25.230 --> 09:28.766
Edith, let me tell you.
See, one of them is glass.

09:28.833 --> 09:31.769
You'll find out
when he gets here
which of them, see?

09:31.836 --> 09:35.105
But don't talk about it,
all right? Huh?
Will you remember that?

09:35.174 --> 09:37.741
Yeah.
All right. Now, you got any
fried chicken in the kitchen?

his briefcase in daddy's cab,

You'd think it was the second

to meet all of you
nice people,

11:41.566 --> 11:43.934
but I think I'd better take
the old briefcase and run.

11:44.002 --> 11:45.936
And incidentally,
Mr. bunker,

11:46.004 --> 11:48.339
here's a little something
for your-- for your trouble.

11:48.407 --> 11:52.610
Oh, geez.
Twenty dollars.
Oh, no, Mr. Davis.

11:52.678 --> 11:54.912
Archie don't need
no reward...

11:54.979 --> 11:57.247
For doing something
for you.

11:57.316 --> 12:00.685
Edith, don't insult
the guest in your
own home, huh?

12:00.752 --> 12:03.220
She don't know what
she's saying there,
Mr. Davis.

12:06.391 --> 12:08.592
And, uh, listen.
I just put in a call.

12:08.660 --> 12:11.662
The briefcase is coming
over. Be here any minute.
All right.

12:11.730 --> 12:13.864
Well, in the meantime,
will you make yourself
at home, huh?

12:13.932 --> 12:15.933
We get you some coffee?
Well, that's awfully
nice of you.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.168
Sit right down here,
Mr. Davis.
Right in my chair.

12:18.236 --> 12:20.338
Make yourself comfortable.
It's the best in the house.

12:20.405 --> 12:23.140
Listen, Mr. Davis, I got to
tell my mother you're here.
She's crazy about you.

12:23.208 --> 12:25.409
Lionel, don't go, huh?
Lionel!

12:26.878 --> 12:29.547
Come on, youse two.
Get over here.

12:29.614 --> 12:31.615
Edith, make
the coffee, huh?

12:31.683 --> 12:35.052
And Edith--
excuse me, Mr. Davis.
Edith, Edith, Edith.

12:35.119 --> 12:37.221
Remember, huh?
Nothing about mm-mmm!

12:37.288 --> 12:40.391
Well, Mr. Davis,
I want to tell you,

12:40.459 --> 12:42.660
it's a real honor
to have you in our home,

12:42.728 --> 12:44.895
thank you.
Breaking bread with us
this way.

12:44.963 --> 12:47.097
I was just saying
to my family
before you came in,

12:47.165 --> 12:51.168
I said, "Sammy Davis Jr.
is maybe the greatest
credit to his race."

12:51.236 --> 12:55.339
Well, thank you very much.
I'm sure you've done good
for yours too.

12:58.877 --> 13:01.111
I try.

13:01.179 --> 13:04.782
Here we are!
Ah, thank you,
Mrs. bunker.

13:04.850 --> 13:07.918
Thanks, Edith.
That's all right.
I can serve Mr. Davis.

13:07.986 --> 13:10.220
Edith, get out of here.

13:11.656 --> 13:15.426
Now, Mr. Davis,
do you take cream and sugar
in your eye?

13:26.838 --> 13:29.507
Mr. Davis,
it's really my fault.

13:29.574 --> 13:33.210
You see, Archie thought
I was gonna say something
about your eye.

13:33.278 --> 13:35.813
Edith, please.

13:35.881 --> 13:38.516
Mr. Davis, could we maybe
offer you something
maybe a little stronger?

13:38.583 --> 13:40.785
A little fleischmann's
and ginger, very smooth?

13:40.852 --> 13:43.921
Oh, no, Mr. bunker. This is
fine. As a matter of fact,
I'm off the sauce.

13:43.988 --> 13:45.956
Booze is a definite
no-no for me.

13:46.024 --> 13:48.893
[ Giggling ]
I just love
the way you talk.

13:48.960 --> 13:52.095
I mean, this must seem
so dull after Hollywood
and all.

13:52.163 --> 13:54.097
Oh, I don't know
about that, Gloria.

13:54.165 --> 13:56.700
There may be Wilder things
going on in new Rochelle
than in Hollywood.

13:56.768 --> 13:59.336
What part of new Rochelle?

14:00.472 --> 14:02.339
Edith!

14:02.407 --> 14:04.542
We got cousins there.

14:04.609 --> 14:06.544
They burn incense.

14:06.611 --> 14:09.513
Who cares?
I hate them anyway!

14:10.816 --> 14:12.750
Get me a beer, huh?

14:12.818 --> 14:15.285
And Edith, a glass
this time, huh?

14:15.353 --> 14:18.021
And open up a fresh box
of twinkies for Mr. Davis.

14:22.727 --> 14:24.795
Twinkies?

14:24.863 --> 14:27.431
Yeah, that's kind of
a wasp soul food.

14:29.100 --> 14:31.669
Uh, don't, uh, listen to him.

14:31.736 --> 14:34.104
He's kind of a meathead,
Mr. Davis.

14:34.172 --> 14:36.574
Look, why don't you stop
calling me Mr. Davis
and just call me Sam?

14:36.641 --> 14:38.742
Oh, hey, I'd like
to do that.
Okay.

14:38.810 --> 14:40.744
"Sam."
Yeah, that's nice.

14:40.812 --> 14:43.413
And you can call me Archie.
I mean, what the hell?

14:46.217 --> 14:51.489
Sam, where you flying
out to tonight?
Las Vegas, maybe?

14:51.556 --> 14:53.757
No, I have a tv special
to do in Hollywood.

14:53.825 --> 14:56.293
Ohh. Gee,
that's beautiful.
Yeah.

14:56.361 --> 14:58.762
Yeah. Well, while
you're hanging around,

14:58.830 --> 15:02.432
will you give us
a little preview, one of
the songs you're gonna do?

15:02.501 --> 15:04.434
Daddy-y!

15:04.503 --> 15:07.771
Mr. Davis makes his living
entertaining. You're asking
him to go to work.

15:07.839 --> 15:10.073
Yeah, arch. How would you
like to be a guest
in somebody's house,

15:10.141 --> 15:13.644
and they said, "come on, arch.
Do some packing and lifting
for us."

15:23.421 --> 15:25.455
Here's your beer, Archie.

15:25.524 --> 15:28.993

at the front door.
I'll get it.

15:36.167 --> 15:38.468
[ Doorbell buzzing ]
There goes the back door.
Get that, Edith.

15:38.537 --> 15:41.338
You see? They're crawling
out of the woodwork now!

15:42.841 --> 15:45.776

with a camera!
Where is he?

Ha-ha! There he is!
Sammy Davis Jr.

15:49.247 --> 15:51.982
Can I have an autograph,
Mr. Davis?
Aw, come on, Barney!

15:52.050 --> 15:53.984
Hey, just one
quick picture, huh?

15:54.052 --> 15:56.520
Now, Barney,
no pictures, huh?
No, no, it's all right.

15:56.588 --> 15:59.089
Oh, yeah?
All right. Hold it.

16:03.261 --> 16:06.797
Hello, Mr. Davis,
this is Mrs. haskell
and her daughter.

16:06.865 --> 16:09.166
I'll take it from here.

16:11.903 --> 16:15.539
Go, Clarissa.
Salute!

16:15.607 --> 16:18.275
She's only been studying
for six months.

Wait! Mrs. haskell!
You forgot your floor!

16:37.261 --> 16:40.397
Yeah. Hey, and now
I'd like to propose a toast.

16:40.465 --> 16:44.101
Uh-huh. To the greatest
entertainer in the world.

16:44.168 --> 16:47.471
And to the man who gave me
the opportunity of meeting
him face to face,

16:47.538 --> 16:50.373
my good friend and neighbor,
Archie bunker.

16:50.441 --> 16:53.543
Hey, that ain't a bad toast,
Barney. I can drink to
that one myself.

16:53.612 --> 16:57.047
I'm Barney Hefner.
I live across the street--
the house with the new porch.

16:57.115 --> 16:59.449
Oh, yeah.

16:59.517 --> 17:02.052
And not only the greatest
entertainer in the world,

17:02.120 --> 17:05.955
but a man who proved
there is good and bad
in all races.

17:06.023 --> 17:08.458
[ Barney ]
Right.
I'll drink to that.

17:10.595 --> 17:13.296
And to friendship.
[ Archie ]
You hear that, huh?

17:13.364 --> 17:15.665
Isn't that nice?
"Friendship."
I'll drink to that myself.

17:25.844 --> 17:28.012
What are you looking at,
Barney?

17:28.079 --> 17:31.815
You're done now.
Get the hell out of here!
You're cranky today, Archie.

17:31.883 --> 17:35.819
There he is!
It's really him!

17:35.887 --> 17:40.090
Oh, and you're just
as cute as you look
on television.

17:43.061 --> 17:45.195
God bless you.
Thank you.

17:45.263 --> 17:48.431
I don't want to take up
any more of your time.
I just came to look at you.

17:48.499 --> 17:50.701
Thank you.
And I'm looking
at you.

17:50.769 --> 17:52.770
Look at you!

17:52.837 --> 17:54.872
Now, I want to say this
right, Mr. Davis.

17:54.939 --> 17:57.141
<i>Shalom l'Chaim.</i>

18:01.079 --> 18:03.847

Oh, Mr. Davis!
My goodness!

18:06.584 --> 18:09.319
Oh, Sammy Davis Jr.!

18:16.695 --> 18:19.529
You know, Sammy,
them words I just heard
you saying here,

18:19.597 --> 18:22.099
they reminded me of something
that I always wanted
to ask you.

18:22.167 --> 18:24.101
Yes, arch?
Yeah, now,

18:24.169 --> 18:27.037
you're being colored,
well, I know you had
no choice in that.

18:30.909 --> 18:32.910
But whatever made you
turn Jew?

18:36.280 --> 18:38.415
Smile, everybody.

18:38.482 --> 18:41.318
Ah, come on, Barney?
What are you doing?
I thought you went home.

18:41.385 --> 18:43.386
You're turning my house
into a peep show.

18:43.454 --> 18:48.158
I'm sorry, Mr. Davis.
Sometimes my father
says the wrong things.

18:48.226 --> 18:50.260
Yeah, I've noticed that.

18:50.328 --> 18:52.996
But he's not a bad guy,
Mr. Davis. I mean, like,

18:53.064 --> 18:55.065
he'd never burn a cross
on your lawn.

18:55.133 --> 19:00.370
No, but if he saw one burning,
he's liable to toast
a marshmallow on it.

19:02.107 --> 19:04.775
Ha-ha-ha-ha--
right on!

19:06.344 --> 19:08.678
This is your fault,
Edith.

19:08.747 --> 19:11.915
I had to throw
Barney Hefner out of here.
Oh, Sammy,

19:11.983 --> 19:14.918
yes?
I was just remembering
the last time I seen you on tv.

19:14.986 --> 19:17.087
It was on
the Johnny Carson show.
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

19:17.155 --> 19:19.356
You was on with that there,
uh, Raquel Walsh.

19:19.423 --> 19:22.292
- Yeah. Remember, Edith?
- Oh, yeah. I remember.

19:22.360 --> 19:25.963
Oh, you were so sweet
to her, Mr. Davis.
<i>Oh, thank you.</i>

19:26.030 --> 19:28.866
Archie said he never thought
he'd see the day...

19:28.933 --> 19:32.970
When coloreds and whites
would be hugging and kissing
coast to coast.

19:40.779 --> 19:45.048
When I ask you a question,
why can't you just say
"yeah" and stop?

19:45.116 --> 19:47.918
Now, will you sit
over there, huh?

19:47.986 --> 19:50.287
And don't say nothin'
till you're asked.

19:50.354 --> 19:54.357
Sammy, she takes everything
I say out of context, see,
'cause what I really meant was--

19:54.425 --> 19:57.761
I know what you mean,
Archie, but you see,
it's not me.

19:57.829 --> 20:01.298
See, they put
a kissing clause
in my contract.

20:01.365 --> 20:04.902
Huh?
Well, you see, it's
those white celebrities.

20:04.969 --> 20:07.404
Well, this year
we're in,

20:07.471 --> 20:09.840
so they all want to
jump on the bandwagon.

20:16.380 --> 20:18.916
You mean to tell me
the networks force you...

20:18.983 --> 20:21.084
To kiss against your will?

20:21.152 --> 20:24.521
Well, what are
you gonna do?

20:24.588 --> 20:27.991
Well, that ain't right, Sam.
I mean, you know--

20:28.059 --> 20:32.863
I mean, gee,
to force the races to intersex
that way on the air?

20:36.134 --> 20:40.437
No prejudice intended,
but I always check with
the Bible on these here things.

20:40.504 --> 20:43.340
<i>Oh.</i>
<i>Yeah. I think that if God</i>
<i>had meant us...</i>

20:43.407 --> 20:45.508
To be together,
he'd have put us together.

20:45.576 --> 20:48.145
But look what he done.
He put you over in Africa,

20:48.213 --> 20:51.181
he put the rest of us
in all the white countries.

20:57.055 --> 20:59.056
Well, you must have told him
where we were,

20:59.123 --> 21:01.691
'cause somebody
came and got us.

21:08.666 --> 21:11.869
I mean, uh,
there was work for us.

21:13.137 --> 21:15.239
I mean, and, uh,
how could you resist?

21:15.306 --> 21:19.009
Free transportation,
room, board, chains.

21:21.346 --> 21:24.248
I think you're talking
about slavery there, Sammy.

21:24.315 --> 21:28.785
I want to tell you that
I was always dead set
against slavery.

over-- pull the plug on that!

21:41.132 --> 21:43.200
You see what goes on
around here, Sammy?

21:43.268 --> 21:48.005
Every time I start to have
a serious conversation,
these kids go crazy.

21:48.072 --> 21:51.608
Another thing they're always
doing to me, they're always
telling me I'm prejudiced.

21:51.675 --> 21:54.477
Now, listen.
You're a guy that's
been around a lot.

21:54.545 --> 21:56.846
You've seen a lot of people
and you know a lot, see?
Yeah?

21:56.915 --> 21:59.216
Now, you look at me.
You figure me for
a prejudiced guy?

21:59.284 --> 22:01.251
Oh, Archie,
you don't tell me...

22:01.319 --> 22:03.486
You're really paying
attention to those
young kids.

22:03.554 --> 22:07.157
What do they know.
I mean, you, prejudiced?

22:07.225 --> 22:10.327
Look, if you
were prejudiced, Archie,
when I came into your house,

22:10.395 --> 22:12.896
you would have called me
a coon or a nigger.

22:12.964 --> 22:15.698
But you didn't say that.
I heard you clear as a bell.

22:15.766 --> 22:18.168
Right straight out,
you said, "colored."

22:21.339 --> 22:23.907
Yeah, that's what
I done, all right.

22:23.975 --> 22:26.977
And if you were prejudiced,
you would, like some people,
close their eyes...

22:27.045 --> 22:29.712
To what's going on
in this great country
that we live in.

22:29.780 --> 22:32.115
But not you, Archie.
Your eyes are wide open.

22:32.183 --> 22:35.685
You can tell the difference
between black and white.

22:35.753 --> 22:38.989
And I have
a deep-rooted feeling that
you'll always be able...

22:39.057 --> 22:41.724
To tell the difference
between black and white.

22:43.261 --> 22:45.295
And if you were prejudiced,
you'd walk around thinking...

22:45.363 --> 22:47.797
That you're better than
anybody else in the world.

22:47.865 --> 22:51.368
But I can honestly say,
having spent these
marvelous moments with you,

22:51.436 --> 22:53.736
you ain't better
than anybody.

23:01.879 --> 23:05.882
Can I have your hand
on that, Sam?
Yes, sir.

23:05.950 --> 23:08.452
And I hope youse all
heard that over there.

23:08.519 --> 23:12.322
That comes straight
from Sammy Davis Jr.,
"Mr. wonderful" himself.

23:12.390 --> 23:15.658

to you once and for all
that I ain't prejudiced.

go back and get mine.
