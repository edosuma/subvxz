Hey, Jenna, did you write
a super-detailed post

00:04.089 --> 00:05.500
about our relationship on Idea Bin?

00:05.516 --> 00:06.968
You had no right to do this.

00:06.992 --> 00:08.648
I want my article taken down.

00:08.984 --> 00:11.475
"He will always be my first true love

00:11.500 --> 00:13.968
and that's something you never forget."

00:17.882 --> 00:19.840
There's a red eye for $300.

00:19.842 --> 00:21.132
I can't believe it's already time

00:21.141 --> 00:22.741
to think about your
ticket back to school.

00:22.743 --> 00:24.009
Where did the summer go?

00:24.011 --> 00:25.610
I'm working, you're studying,

00:25.612 --> 00:28.480
my skin saw more sun in Maine
than it does in California

00:28.482 --> 00:30.148
and I barely spend any time with Morgan.

00:30.150 --> 00:32.450
- That's probably a good thing.
- Wait, what?

00:32.452 --> 00:34.352
See, I knew you didn't
trust me with her.

00:34.354 --> 00:35.754
I'll hold her for, like, 10 seconds,

00:35.756 --> 00:37.789
and then you rush over
to take her from me.

00:37.791 --> 00:39.516
I'm not the most coordinated
person in the world,

00:39.541 --> 00:41.523
but I can safely hold a baby.

00:41.548 --> 00:42.925
She's not gonna break.

00:42.950 --> 00:45.210
I meant the sun. You don't tan well.

00:45.235 --> 00:46.992
So you do trust me with her?

00:47.017 --> 00:49.774
You don't need to worry
about taking care of a baby.

00:49.799 --> 00:51.227
But Lissa's, like, my age,

00:51.243 --> 00:52.843
and you leave her with Morgan all day.

00:52.845 --> 00:53.844
That is different.

00:53.846 --> 00:55.946
Lissa is very motherly.

00:55.948 --> 00:57.714
Why, because she dresses
like an Easter egg

00:57.716 --> 00:58.748
and makes a to-do list?

00:58.750 --> 01:00.250
I mean, I can be motherly.

01:00.252 --> 01:02.819
Sweetie, you cut off the
heads to all your Bratz dolls.

01:02.821 --> 01:05.288
Their faces were scary as hell.

01:05.290 --> 01:06.568
Look...

01:07.259 --> 01:09.226
here, at least let me hold
her while your cooking.

01:09.228 --> 01:10.594

01:15.267 --> 01:16.967

01:25.488 --> 01:27.143

Oh, no, actually, I can't.

02:10.122 --> 02:11.588
