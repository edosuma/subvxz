00:03.137 --> 00:04.804
I know I'm jumping
the gun a bit,

00:04.872 --> 00:09.233
but I had this made
for the baby at hermes.

00:09.300 --> 00:12.104
So she can ride the maid!

00:12.172 --> 00:13.496
It is adorable.

00:13.564 --> 00:15.387
Uh, but are we still in love
with the name "Charlotte"?

00:15.955 --> 00:17.969
I think so.
Why do you ask?

00:18.037 --> 00:21.163
Charlotte?

00:22.462 --> 00:23.629
Are you serious?

00:23.696 --> 00:25.825
Lemon went to middle school
with a Charlotte

00:25.893 --> 00:28.388
who used to rub herself
against a tree during recess.

00:28.456 --> 00:30.221
I want to know
why you would tell Lemon

00:30.288 --> 00:31.753
something so personal.

00:31.821 --> 00:34.221
I know that my relationship
with Lemon may seem strange,

00:34.289 --> 00:35.520
but I am her mentor.

00:35.588 --> 00:39.153
And the Donaghy mentoring
experience is immersive.

00:39.218 --> 00:40.850
There need to be boundaries.

00:40.918 --> 00:42.883
That woman is your employee.

00:42.950 --> 00:44.615
No, she's more than that.

00:44.683 --> 00:46.781
I don't choose
my mentees lightly.

00:46.849 --> 00:48.748
They have to have
the drive and ambition

00:48.815 --> 00:50.180
to be worth my time,

00:50.248 --> 00:51.981
the intelligence to understand

00:52.049 --> 00:53.414
the challenges
they're going to face,

00:53.481 --> 00:54.848
the humility to accept my help,

00:54.915 --> 00:56.348
and finally,

00:56.416 --> 00:59.382
a life that is a bottomless
swamp of chaos.

00:59.449 --> 01:03.249
Drive, intelligence,
humility, chaos...

01:03.317 --> 01:04.715
or the acronym "dihc."

01:04.784 --> 01:06.717
I'm looking for dihc, Avery.

01:06.784 --> 01:08.717
And I'm gonna take it
wherever I can find it.

01:08.785 --> 01:11.084
It's been four years, Jack.

01:11.151 --> 01:12.918
Maybe it's time
for Liz to graduate.

01:12.985 --> 01:15.952
Maybe it's time for you
to carry this baby.

01:16.020 --> 01:19.152
Maybe you and Liz can raise it.

01:19.220 --> 01:20.619
Oh, no.

01:20.687 --> 01:24.088
Crazy hormone swing.

01:24.155 --> 01:27.222
Why does everything
smell like onions?

01:30.991 --> 01:33.223
Lemon.
Boundaries.

01:35.958 --> 01:37.157
Got it.

01:40.194 --> 01:50.231

01:55.971 --> 01:57.904
In here, you can see
one of NBC's editing bays.

01:58.772 --> 02:01.039
<i>Tracy Jordan,
the star of YGS</i>

02:01.107 --> 02:03.041
and numerous films, has died.

02:03.109 --> 02:05.876
No!
No, it can't be!

02:05.944 --> 02:08.678
I'm not done with him, Jacob!

02:08.746 --> 02:11.479
He stays on this side!

02:11.547 --> 02:12.580
Kenneth, Tracy's not dead.

02:12.648 --> 02:14.814
Nbc news makes obituaries
for celebrities

02:14.882 --> 02:16.048
to have them ready.

02:16.116 --> 02:17.149
They're just updating Tracy's

02:17.216 --> 02:18.750
to include his recent
submarine d.U.I.

02:18.817 --> 02:21.418
Oh, thank goodness.

02:21.485 --> 02:24.486
Say, do you think I could
get a copy of that

02:24.554 --> 02:26.254
to show Mr. Jordan?

02:26.322 --> 02:28.522
That way, he can see
his own funeral,

02:28.590 --> 02:30.189
just like Tom Sawyer!

02:30.257 --> 02:31.790
Well, Tom was a fellow
from my town

02:31.858 --> 02:33.891
we accidentally buried alive.

02:33.959 --> 02:36.226
Funny story,
after we dug him back up,

02:36.294 --> 02:37.660
he tried to kill all of us.

02:40.763 --> 02:42.363
- Hello?
- Hey, Liz.

02:42.431 --> 02:44.598
It's your father.
Dick Lemon.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.932
Dad, you don't have to say
your name every time.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.101
Telephone etiquette
is important, Liz.

02:49.168 --> 02:52.069
It lets people know your race
even when they can't see you.

02:52.137 --> 02:54.404
Anyway, got a busy week?

02:54.472 --> 02:56.238
Not really,
I was gonna take this class

02:56.306 --> 02:57.339
called "cooking for one,"

02:57.407 --> 02:59.040
but the teacher killed himself.

02:59.108 --> 03:00.141
Well, what about a visit?

03:00.208 --> 03:01.942
Really?
That would be great.

03:02.010 --> 03:03.743
With you and mom here,
the doormen will have

03:03.811 --> 03:06.745
to eat their words about me
never having friends over.

03:06.813 --> 03:08.713
Well, it'll just be me
this time, Elizabeth.

03:08.781 --> 03:09.847
Your mother isn't coming.

03:09.915 --> 03:11.715
What? You and mom
always travel together.

03:11.783 --> 03:13.283
Well, she's not
coming this time.

03:13.350 --> 03:15.584
I just want to have
a little fun by myself.

03:15.652 --> 03:16.951
Can't a guy have a little fun?

03:17.019 --> 03:19.620
- What is wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?

03:19.688 --> 03:21.188
Your mother's home.

03:21.255 --> 03:24.290
This conversation
never happened.

03:26.292 --> 03:28.593
What? What?

03:28.660 --> 03:30.694
I am a Jedi!

03:30.762 --> 03:34.028
<i>Tracy Jordan,
star of the fat bitch movies,</i>

03:34.096 --> 03:36.631
was also voted "worst
representation of a black man"

03:36.698 --> 03:37.798
nine years in a row.

03:37.866 --> 03:41.100
Perhaps best known
for his fcc fines...

03:41.168 --> 03:43.736
And thank God
I didn't [bleep] anybody,

03:43.803 --> 03:45.637
and thank God
I [bleep] my [bleep].

03:45.705 --> 03:47.372
And giving the queen parvo.

03:47.439 --> 03:49.073
This is terrible!

03:49.140 --> 03:51.341
When I'm dead,
that's what I leave behind?

03:51.409 --> 03:53.443
That's how my grandkids
will remember me

03:53.510 --> 03:55.143
as they fly around
in their jetpacks?

03:55.211 --> 03:58.246
Well, it's not fair
out of context.

03:58.313 --> 04:00.448
Her highness
was sending signals.

04:00.515 --> 04:03.217
It doesn't matter.
That's how the world sees me...

04:03.284 --> 04:05.618
as some idiot millionaire.

04:05.686 --> 04:07.186
Who, mark Cuban?

04:07.253 --> 04:09.287
That guy ran me over
with a jet ski.

04:10.756 --> 04:12.324
What is he so upset about?

04:12.392 --> 04:13.658
It's my fault.

04:13.726 --> 04:15.726
I let Mr. Jordan
see his obituary.

04:15.794 --> 04:17.094
He's dying?

04:17.161 --> 04:19.462
Fine, I'll sing at his funeral.

04:19.529 --> 04:20.762
No, ma'am.

04:20.831 --> 04:23.632
Nbc news makes celebrity
obituaries ahead of time.

04:23.700 --> 04:25.634
Typical liberal media.

04:25.702 --> 04:28.203
They do?
Well, then I need to see mine.

04:28.270 --> 04:30.938
If they used any of the footage
from my shoplifting arrest,

04:31.006 --> 04:33.673
that would be great because
my arms looked fantastic.

04:37.644 --> 04:38.811
Hey, can I talk to you
for a sec?

04:38.879 --> 04:40.713
My dad just called, and...

04:40.781 --> 04:42.581
Lemon, uh, I'm sorry.

04:42.648 --> 04:43.948
If this is about
a personal matter,

04:44.016 --> 04:45.149
we can't discuss it.

04:45.217 --> 04:47.184
- What? Why?
- It's Avery.

04:47.252 --> 04:48.952
She's going
to be my wife someday,

04:49.020 --> 04:51.554
and understandably,
the nature of our relationship

04:51.622 --> 04:53.256
is a little confusing to her.

04:53.323 --> 04:55.057
Oh, she feels threatened.

04:55.125 --> 04:57.159
It must be my "sesuality,"

04:57.227 --> 04:59.928
because I am
so very "sesual."

04:59.995 --> 05:01.496
You like that?

05:01.563 --> 05:04.398
And maybe Avery is a little
emotional these days.

05:04.466 --> 05:06.700
She's put on considerable
boob weight.

05:06.768 --> 05:09.269
She's not used to that,
and sometimes she

05:09.337 --> 05:10.670
just falls over.

05:10.738 --> 05:12.005
It's stressful.

05:12.073 --> 05:14.340
But she might have
a point about us.

05:14.408 --> 05:16.742
Maybe it isn't appropriate
for you to still come to me

05:16.810 --> 05:18.010
with every little
problem in your life.

05:18.078 --> 05:20.879
Oh. Okay.

05:20.947 --> 05:23.481
Great. Fine.

05:23.549 --> 05:25.549
I'll solve my own problems.

05:31.455 --> 05:34.157
Blammo. Solved it.

05:34.225 --> 05:36.493
What do you mean,
I don't have an obituary?

05:36.561 --> 05:38.295
I'm Jenna Maroney.

05:38.363 --> 05:39.829
I played arts and literature

05:39.898 --> 05:41.666
in the film adaptation
of trivial pursuit.

05:41.733 --> 05:43.133
I know who you are,
miss Maroney,

05:43.201 --> 05:44.967
but you're not on the list.

05:45.035 --> 05:47.370
They only make obits
for people they think are,

05:47.438 --> 05:48.804
you know, important.

05:48.872 --> 05:50.739
Like who?

05:50.807 --> 05:52.841
Kim Jong-il?

05:52.909 --> 05:54.877
I never heard of her.

05:54.945 --> 05:57.479
I should be on here.

05:57.547 --> 05:59.147
You wanted to see me, sir?

05:59.215 --> 06:01.016
Jonathan,
I may be in the market

06:01.083 --> 06:03.451
for a new young person
to mentor.

06:03.519 --> 06:04.819
Oh, my God.

06:04.886 --> 06:07.454
Sir, I have dreamed
of this moment...

06:07.521 --> 06:11.057
but my fear is that you don't
have enough ambition.

06:11.125 --> 06:14.894
The drive to deserve
my mentorship.

06:14.962 --> 06:16.262
No, sir, there is nothing
in the world

06:16.330 --> 06:17.697
that I wouldn't do for you.

06:17.765 --> 06:20.032
My attorney is waiting
in his office.

06:20.100 --> 06:23.302
He will present you
with a contract to be my mentee

06:23.370 --> 06:24.837
if you bring him...

06:26.239 --> 06:27.539
My pinky.

06:27.607 --> 06:28.974
No, sir.

06:29.042 --> 06:31.009
Then you wouldn't
be perfect anymore.

06:31.077 --> 06:33.010
- I won't do it.
- Exactly.

06:33.078 --> 06:35.412
I knew that you wouldn't.

06:35.480 --> 06:36.713
No, no, watch!

06:36.781 --> 06:39.116
I'll cut off my pinky
and tell him it's yours.

06:39.183 --> 06:41.985
Jonathan.

06:42.052 --> 06:45.521
Ambition is the willingness
to kill the things you love

06:45.589 --> 06:48.156
and eat them
in order to stay alive.

06:48.223 --> 06:50.323
Haven't you ever read
my throw pillow?

06:52.000 --> 06:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:59.299 --> 07:01.633
- Dad.
- Hi, sweetheart!

07:01.701 --> 07:02.867
Mwah!

07:02.935 --> 07:04.369
Where are your glasses?

07:04.436 --> 07:05.970
And what's with that shirt?

07:06.038 --> 07:07.271
I don't need my glasses,

07:07.339 --> 07:09.473
and this is
an Edward Hardy shirt.

07:09.541 --> 07:12.810
A very hip Latino-sounding
blur at Mervyn's

07:12.877 --> 07:14.444
said I looked good in it.

07:14.512 --> 07:16.246
Dad, what are you doing?

07:16.313 --> 07:17.780
You're traveling alone,

07:17.848 --> 07:20.316
you show up here looking like
you've been on spring break

07:20.384 --> 07:21.817
for 300 years,

07:21.885 --> 07:25.020
and earlier, mom called
and told me to give you a hug

07:25.088 --> 07:26.822
before your colonoscopy.

07:26.889 --> 07:28.556
- Uh-oh.

07:28.624 --> 07:31.392
Dad, look at me.
What is going on?

07:31.460 --> 07:33.294
Honey, there's no easy way
to say it.

07:33.361 --> 07:34.761
Your mother and I
are taking a little break.

07:34.829 --> 07:37.096
A break?
After 45 years?

07:37.164 --> 07:39.765
Honey, it's complicated.
We're having problems.

07:39.833 --> 07:42.134
Really, does mom know
you're having problems?

07:42.202 --> 07:43.535
'Cause she thinks
you're at the doctor.

07:43.603 --> 07:46.104
Your mother and I
don't laugh like we used to.

07:46.171 --> 07:48.105
I don't know what happened.

07:48.173 --> 07:51.041
Where has my best friend gone?

07:51.109 --> 07:54.345
Ugh!
What are you talking about?

07:54.412 --> 07:57.581
You're just pretending
like there's some big problem

07:57.649 --> 08:00.983
so you can come up here
and, what, try to pick up women?

08:01.051 --> 08:03.318
You think they won't notice
that you're 80

08:03.386 --> 08:04.953
because you took
your glasses off?

08:05.021 --> 08:08.156
I will not be spoken to
this way, young lady.

08:08.223 --> 08:09.890
You know what,
you're not staying here

08:09.958 --> 08:11.424
during your little time-out.

08:11.492 --> 08:15.095
Your
"gentleman's intermission."

08:15.163 --> 08:16.931
Go to a hotel.

08:16.998 --> 08:19.166
Or better yet, go home to mom.

08:19.234 --> 08:21.602
Fine.
I don't need you.

08:21.669 --> 08:24.270
I'm meeting up
with my old army buddy Gary.

08:24.338 --> 08:25.705
Tonight,
we're doing a push-up,

08:25.773 --> 08:28.541
and tomorrow, we're going
to a bar called "Swingles."

08:29.910 --> 08:31.344
Gary's wife just died
a couple of days ago,

08:31.412 --> 08:33.111
and he hasn't returned
the hospital bed yet,

08:33.179 --> 08:34.413
so I can sleep there!

08:34.481 --> 08:36.347
Now, where's the door?

08:36.414 --> 08:39.416
I'm not telling!

08:41.186 --> 08:43.421
Cold.

08:43.489 --> 08:45.489
Colder.
It's...

08:46.791 --> 08:48.225
ha ha!

08:58.660 --> 08:59.894
Hello?

09:08.936 --> 09:10.636
Hey, girl!

09:10.704 --> 09:11.970
What do you want, Liz?

09:12.038 --> 09:13.672
Look, I know
I shouldn't be calling,

09:13.739 --> 09:14.839
but my dad is in town,

09:14.907 --> 09:17.475
taking a break
from being married.

09:17.543 --> 09:19.009
It's a
gentleman's intermission.

09:19.077 --> 09:21.510
And you want to talk
about this with your boss?

09:21.578 --> 09:22.778
Well, when you put it
like that...

09:22.845 --> 09:24.379
with the mean voice and all...

09:24.447 --> 09:26.981
good night, Liz.

09:34.889 --> 09:37.257
What's wrong, tray?

09:37.324 --> 09:39.592
Why are you sitting
in your sadness spotlight?

09:39.660 --> 09:42.728
I seen my nbc news obituary,
Jackie d.

09:42.795 --> 09:44.061
I look like a fool in it.

09:44.129 --> 09:45.796
Well, certainly
you can't be surprised

09:45.864 --> 09:47.631
that there's a lot of negative
stuff about you out there.

09:47.699 --> 09:48.832
Don't you ever Google yourself?

09:48.899 --> 09:50.700
Sure, I Google myself
all the time.

09:50.768 --> 09:52.134
Like when Angie's
not in the mood,

09:52.202 --> 09:55.003
or I'm alone in the hotel.

09:55.070 --> 09:57.438
Uh, Tracy, you do know
that googling yourself

09:57.506 --> 09:59.440
means looking yourself up
on the Internet.

09:59.507 --> 10:00.874
I did not know that.

10:00.942 --> 10:04.244
That explains why Liz Lemon
was so cool the other day.

10:04.312 --> 10:07.080
Liz Lemon, you mind if I
Google myself in your office?

10:07.148 --> 10:08.782
- Sure, Tracy.
- Can I use your computer?

10:08.849 --> 10:11.084
How else are you gonna do it?

10:11.151 --> 10:14.520
Tracy, you are someone
with a lot of problems,

10:14.588 --> 10:16.255
who needs constant guidance.

10:16.322 --> 10:18.090
And don't forget,
I never listen.

10:18.158 --> 10:21.127
If you're open to it,
I'm very good at giving advice.

10:21.194 --> 10:23.128
For example,
with your obit problem.

10:23.196 --> 10:26.163
Now, you've spent years creating
a certain public image.

10:26.231 --> 10:28.031
But you can change that.

10:28.099 --> 10:29.466
You just have to do
what prince hal did.

10:29.533 --> 10:31.034
Who's prince hal?

10:31.101 --> 10:32.535
<i>From Henry iv.</i>

10:32.603 --> 10:35.070
You played him
in central park last summer.

10:35.138 --> 10:37.372
I don't know any of my lines!

10:37.440 --> 10:40.507
Everyone thought prince hal
was a drunken wastrel.

10:40.575 --> 10:41.975
But when he became king,

10:42.042 --> 10:44.643
he transformed himself
into a wise and just ruler.

10:44.711 --> 10:46.111
He changed the headline.

10:46.179 --> 10:47.812
That's what
you have to do, Tracy.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.247
You know something, Jackie d.?

10:49.315 --> 10:52.517
That thing I said earlier about
prince hal got me thinking.

10:52.585 --> 10:55.555
I have to change my headline.

10:55.622 --> 10:57.323
Yes, that's what I just said.

10:57.391 --> 10:58.791
Now, if I can help you...

10:58.858 --> 11:01.259
No, no, no, Jackie D.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.929
I don't need your help.
I'm Tracy Jordan.

11:03.996 --> 11:07.599
When I go to sleep,
nothing happens in the world.

11:10.302 --> 11:12.936
He failed the test of humility.

11:13.004 --> 11:15.171
I cannot be his mentor.

11:15.239 --> 11:17.840
Well, I'd love for you
to be my mentor, sir.

11:17.908 --> 11:20.875
But unfortunately,
I already have one.

11:20.943 --> 11:23.712
Stop calling me!

11:27.049 --> 11:29.618
Okay, what would Jack
tell me to do?

11:29.685 --> 11:31.353
First, he would
probably explain

11:31.420 --> 11:33.855
that evolution
makes men promiscuous,

11:33.923 --> 11:36.157
even when they're 80,
like my pathetic dad.

11:36.225 --> 11:37.856
Is your dad pathetic,

11:37.924 --> 11:41.325
or is he maybe,
on some level, admirable?

11:41.393 --> 11:43.126
Maybe his sons would
respect him more as a man.

11:43.194 --> 11:45.161
Maybe they'd stop calling him
a "bald wang"

11:45.228 --> 11:46.595
in front of the babysitter.

11:46.663 --> 11:49.263
I mean, can you imagine
Dick Lemon at a singles bar?

11:49.331 --> 11:51.565
It makes me want to barf.

11:51.633 --> 11:54.668
Ugh, those old men that hit
on you at clubs are so lame.

11:54.735 --> 11:57.238
Lame?
Or... or is it heroic?

11:57.305 --> 11:59.340
Why can't they see
how idiotic they look?

11:59.408 --> 12:01.342
With guys like that,
I always just say,

12:01.409 --> 12:03.610
"who's younger...
me or your daughter?"

12:03.678 --> 12:07.513
That usually creeps them out
enough that they leave.

12:07.581 --> 12:08.681
That wouldn't work on me.

12:08.748 --> 12:10.683
Jack.

12:10.750 --> 12:12.718
Why does Tracy have a news obit
and I don't?

12:12.786 --> 12:13.852
Huh.

12:13.920 --> 12:15.254
I never thought of you

12:15.321 --> 12:16.889
for the Donaghy
mentoring experience,

12:16.957 --> 12:19.891
but you are an unceasing
onslaught of dysfunction.

12:19.959 --> 12:22.226
Dr. Drew called me
"unfixab."

12:22.294 --> 12:24.428
Let's think this through.

12:24.496 --> 12:26.530
You don't haven obit
because you haven't done

12:26.598 --> 12:27.698
as much as Tracy has.

12:27.766 --> 12:28.699
His movies gross millions,

12:28.767 --> 12:30.634
his comedy albums go platinum,

12:30.701 --> 12:32.835
and he owns the world's only
giraffe basketball team,

12:32.903 --> 12:34.203
the New York necks.

12:34.270 --> 12:36.837
- So your problem...
- My problem?

12:36.905 --> 12:38.672
Nbc news has the problem.

12:38.740 --> 12:40.173
No, I don't think that's right.

12:40.241 --> 12:41.508
And you know
what I'm going to do?

12:41.576 --> 12:43.142
I'm gonna make my own obituary,

12:43.210 --> 12:45.178
and show them
how wrong they are.

12:45.246 --> 12:47.079
Then I'm afraid
you're on your own, Jenna.

12:47.147 --> 12:49.415
You have failed
the test of intelligence.

12:49.483 --> 12:52.651
Oh, really?
Well, so are you!

12:59.791 --> 13:02.025
- Hello, Lemon.
- Hey, Jack.

13:02.093 --> 13:03.760
How's business things?

13:03.828 --> 13:07.297
I made several overseas
phone calls today.

13:07.364 --> 13:08.965
Well, I'm doing great.

13:09.032 --> 13:12.401
Like the song,
I am taking on my business.

13:12.469 --> 13:14.770
Uh, no, it's, uh...

13:14.837 --> 13:17.472
right.
Forget it.

13:23.979 --> 13:26.447
Shoulders back, Lemon.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.748
You're not welcoming people
to castle frankenstein.

13:34.820 --> 13:37.789
I can't read any of this,
Gary, can you?

13:37.856 --> 13:41.726
Uh, give us this third thing.

13:46.831 --> 13:47.965
Uh...

13:48.032 --> 13:51.068
Hello, miss.
My name is Ricky.

13:51.136 --> 13:52.236
I'm...

13:52.304 --> 13:53.837
Dorothy Michaels.

13:53.905 --> 13:56.840
And you don't look stupid
in that shirt at all.

13:56.908 --> 13:58.342
What do you gentlemen do?

13:58.409 --> 13:59.910
We work for the FBI.

13:59.978 --> 14:03.613
Mm-hmm,
female body inspectors.

14:05.116 --> 14:07.751
Tell me, was your father
a donkey herder?

14:07.818 --> 14:10.621
- Because that ass is...
- No, no!

14:10.688 --> 14:13.891
My father worked
at Philadelphia power and light.

14:13.959 --> 14:17.194
It's me, your daughter.
Elizabeth Lemon.

14:17.262 --> 14:19.230
Elizabeth, what are you doing?

14:19.297 --> 14:22.033
Ugh, this woman's trying
to hit on her own father!

14:22.101 --> 14:23.401
No, no!

14:23.469 --> 14:25.603
Good people of Swingles,
hear me out.

14:25.671 --> 14:28.306
My married,
80-year-old father

14:28.374 --> 14:30.876
is taking
a gentleman's intermission.

14:30.943 --> 14:32.577
That's a great name
for what I'm doing.

14:32.645 --> 14:34.579
Just what are you trying
to accomplish

14:34.647 --> 14:36.882
with this stunt, young lady?

14:36.949 --> 14:39.218
I am trying to show you
how disgusting you are.

14:39.285 --> 14:40.919
No, you're the disgusting one.

14:42.055 --> 14:43.589
Yeah, that was a terrible plan.

14:43.656 --> 14:46.058
Come on, Gary.
Let's go hit that bar

14:46.125 --> 14:49.761
with the cool rainbow flags.

14:54.239 --> 14:56.506
- A two-time cable ace
award nominee,

14:56.574 --> 15:00.243
and three-time
Tony...Shaloub sex partner,

15:00.310 --> 15:04.980
Jenna Maroney is perhaps best
remembered for being beautiful.

15:05.048 --> 15:08.983
Jenna Maroney, dead at 32.

15:09.051 --> 15:13.154
♪ Jenna, you ripped
through our lives ♪

15:13.222 --> 15:16.991
♪ like the passin of the wind ♪

15:17.059 --> 15:19.159
read back what we have so far.

15:19.227 --> 15:21.996
"Ideas to change
Mr. Jordan's headline."

15:22.063 --> 15:24.464
Then you said,
"read back what we have so far."

15:24.532 --> 15:26.566
Why is this so hard?

15:26.634 --> 15:29.636
All I want to do is turn
into a worldwide hero overnight.

15:29.703 --> 15:30.770
Coming up
in our next half hour,

15:30.837 --> 15:32.105
we're gonna meet a heroic cat

15:32.172 --> 15:35.175
who saved its owner's life
by dialing 911.

15:35.243 --> 15:37.144
What an amazing story.

15:37.211 --> 15:38.712
That cat's a hero.

15:38.780 --> 15:41.749
If I save it,
I'm a double hero.

15:41.816 --> 15:43.217
Ken, I need your help.

15:43.284 --> 15:44.818
Well, I actually have
an important church...

15:44.886 --> 15:46.787
Denied!

15:46.854 --> 15:47.821
Hey, what's going on?

15:47.888 --> 15:49.155
I got a message
you wanted to see me?

15:49.223 --> 15:51.691
Yes, I know you're
interviewing John Boehner later.

15:51.759 --> 15:54.293
You should know that he has
very tiny has, so...

15:54.361 --> 15:56.061
Let him hold a miniature golf
scoring pencil

15:56.129 --> 15:58.597
to make them look normal,
obviously.

15:58.664 --> 16:00.598
But why are you...

16:00.666 --> 16:02.834
oh, my God.
Are you trying to mentor me?

16:02.901 --> 16:05.736
- All right, calm down.
- I am squared away, Donaghy.

16:05.804 --> 16:07.204
I get four hours
of sleep a night,

16:07.272 --> 16:08.472
eat 1,200 calories a day,

16:08.540 --> 16:10.207
and my closet has been
on the cover

16:10.275 --> 16:12.210
<i>of organized living twice.</i>

16:12.277 --> 16:14.445
Damn it, I knew you'd fail
the test of chaos.

16:14.513 --> 16:15.480
Is it really that difficult

16:15.547 --> 16:17.348
to find someone new to mentor?

16:17.416 --> 16:18.449
It's impossible.

16:18.517 --> 16:19.683
I would never say this
to her face,

16:19.751 --> 16:21.084
but Lemon is above average.

16:21.152 --> 16:23.220
She's got just the right amount
of dihc for me.

16:23.287 --> 16:25.254
I hear it, and I don't care.

16:25.322 --> 16:27.789
I've cast a wide net, but even
the junior executives here...

16:27.857 --> 16:30.191
there's something wrong
with this generation.

16:30.259 --> 16:31.726
Hey, are you Jack?
Sorry I'm late.

16:31.794 --> 16:33.161
B.T. Dubbs,

16:33.229 --> 16:35.129
I gotta leave for my ironic
kickball league in about ten.

16:35.197 --> 16:37.365
Also, I'm not interested
in this position

16:37.433 --> 16:38.767
unless I'm gonna be
constantly praised.

16:38.835 --> 16:40.402
And I won't cut my hair.

16:44.906 --> 16:46.574
It's go time, Ken.
Are you ready?

16:46.641 --> 16:48.675
I've got my hammer,
I've got my mask.

16:48.743 --> 16:50.410
You just stop me
before I get to that cat.

16:50.478 --> 16:52.212
I'll be right behind you.

16:52.280 --> 16:54.214
And finally,
the weekend box office crown

16:54.282 --> 16:56.851
<i>belonged to the indie darling
hard to watch.</i>

16:56.919 --> 16:58.553
Critics have been praising
the gritty drama,

16:58.620 --> 17:00.888
and the performance
of its star Tracy Jordan.

17:00.956 --> 17:02.657
Now, not to editorialize,

17:02.724 --> 17:04.858
but if Jordan doesn't
win the Oscar,

17:04.926 --> 17:06.761
that would be
the stupidest thing

17:06.829 --> 17:08.530
since the following segue...

17:08.598 --> 17:09.731
speaking of cats...

17:09.799 --> 17:10.832
An Oscar.

17:10.900 --> 17:12.067
If I won an Oscar,

17:12.134 --> 17:13.635
everyone would have
to respect me.

17:13.703 --> 17:16.238
My obituary will read
"Oscar winner"

17:16.305 --> 17:18.607
instead of
"children's soccer heckler."

17:18.674 --> 17:21.843
It would change my headline.

17:24.414 --> 17:27.449
I feel like
I'm forgetting something.

17:28.618 --> 17:30.685
I left Tracy Jr.
in Atlantic City!

17:33.156 --> 17:36.059
Die, hero cat!
I hate you!

17:38.429 --> 17:41.698
I said I'm gonna kill that cat!

17:41.766 --> 17:43.867
Killing cats is wrong!

17:43.935 --> 17:46.670
Unless it's to make a hat!

17:46.738 --> 17:48.872
My skull!

17:48.940 --> 17:51.674
Jenna Maroney just saved
the hero cat!

17:51.741 --> 17:54.507
That makes me a double hero!

17:54.575 --> 17:57.376
Try to deny me my obit now,
you jags!

17:57.443 --> 17:59.778
And tell people
in lieu of flowers,

17:59.845 --> 18:02.313
they can pour jewels
into my open coffin.

18:04.716 --> 18:07.050
I'm very injured.

18:13.423 --> 18:15.023
You wanted to see me?

18:15.091 --> 18:16.658
- No, Lemon.
- I did.

18:16.726 --> 18:18.226
Albino ninja!

18:18.294 --> 18:20.395
Look, I never should have
interfered with, um,

18:20.463 --> 18:21.862
whatever this is.

18:21.930 --> 18:23.197
- Work husband-slash-uncle.

18:23.264 --> 18:24.498
- Coworker-slash-little brother.

18:24.565 --> 18:27.199
Right, well, she's not ready
to move on.

18:27.267 --> 18:28.567
It's true.

18:28.634 --> 18:31.169
I'm wearing a Duane reade bag
as underwear today.

18:31.236 --> 18:33.203
All right.
And for whatever reason,

18:33.271 --> 18:35.538
he needs you too.

18:35.606 --> 18:37.407
It's a symbiotic relationship.

18:37.474 --> 18:39.208
I'm a mighty
great white shark, Lemon,

18:39.276 --> 18:40.743
and you are a remora,

18:40.810 --> 18:42.978
clinging to me
with your suction cup head.

18:43.046 --> 18:45.313
I give you a free ride,
and in exchange,

18:45.381 --> 18:47.583
you, uh, eat my parasites.

18:47.651 --> 18:49.651
I'm gonna leave you two alone.

18:49.719 --> 18:51.919
I already briefed him
on your problem.

18:51.987 --> 18:54.321
The gentleman's
intermission, yes.

18:54.389 --> 18:56.256
Uh, Lemon, does your father
have a cell phone?

18:56.324 --> 18:58.658
Yes. Jack is back.

18:58.725 --> 19:01.761
If anyone can talk sense
into my dad, it's you.

19:01.828 --> 19:04.630
Oh, no, I'm not gonna
talk sense into anybody.

19:04.698 --> 19:06.098
Your father's being irrational.

19:06.166 --> 19:09.068
And irrational behavior
doesn't respond to rationality.

19:09.136 --> 19:11.270
It responds to fear.

19:14.340 --> 19:15.440
Hello?

19:15.508 --> 19:16.608
Yeah, is this Dick Lemon?

19:16.676 --> 19:17.877
This is he.
Who's calling?

19:17.944 --> 19:20.179
I'm tricia's boyfriend,
you scumbag.

19:20.246 --> 19:21.880
She told me what happened
with youse last night.

19:21.948 --> 19:23.115
Now I'm gonna come
and find you,

19:23.183 --> 19:24.483
and I'm gonna
kick your ass so hard,

19:24.550 --> 19:26.050
you're gonna be
throwing up my toenails.

19:26.118 --> 19:27.952
No, no, no, no, no.
There's been a mistake.

19:28.020 --> 19:30.154
I did not do anything
with anyone last night.

19:30.222 --> 19:31.522
Certainly not a tricia.

19:31.590 --> 19:32.690
Oh, now you're telling me

19:32.757 --> 19:34.191
my tricia's not
good enough for you?

19:34.259 --> 19:35.960
She's an angel!

19:36.027 --> 19:37.361
I'll tell you what,
I'm getting my brothers,

19:37.429 --> 19:38.863
and we're coming over there,
and we're gonna...

19:46.605 --> 19:48.306
Dick Lemon speaking.

19:48.373 --> 19:50.374
How dare you hang up on me.

19:50.442 --> 19:53.478
I'm a corrupt cop!
My brother's a corrupt fireman.

19:53.545 --> 19:55.213
He's gonna set you on fire,

19:55.280 --> 19:56.781
and I am not gonna
investigate it.

19:56.848 --> 19:58.082
That won't be necessary.

19:58.150 --> 20:00.317
I'm leaving
for Philadelphia today.

20:00.385 --> 20:02.753
Dick, listen,
tricia told me you're married.

20:02.821 --> 20:03.921
I know men are meant
to be promiscuous

20:03.989 --> 20:05.156
because of evolution,

20:05.223 --> 20:07.658
but you made a commitment
to a woman you love.

20:07.726 --> 20:09.327
I do.
I do love her.

20:09.395 --> 20:10.895
Yeah, that's right.
You're a lucky man.

20:10.963 --> 20:12.130
"A," because you have a family

20:12.198 --> 20:14.165
and "b," because I have not
curb-stomped you

20:14.233 --> 20:15.400
in front of your grandchildren.

20:15.468 --> 20:18.136
Actually, I don't have
grandchildren.

20:18.204 --> 20:19.438
Why not?
Tricia told me you have

20:19.506 --> 20:20.506
a 40-year-old daughter.
What's wrong with her?

20:20.573 --> 20:22.074
- Okay, mm-mm.
- I gotta go.

20:22.142 --> 20:23.508
I'm taking tricia
to laser zeppelin.

20:23.576 --> 20:25.978
You take care now.
Go necks!

20:30.050 --> 20:32.318
Can I show you
a weird thing on my leg?

20:32.386 --> 20:34.954
Yeah.

20:35.022 --> 20:36.789
That's gotta be removed.

20:36.790 --> 20:38.650

20:38.683 --> 20:40.084
Claire?

20:40.152 --> 20:41.418
Claire?

20:41.486 --> 20:43.454
Joanne?
Okay.

20:43.522 --> 20:45.589
Well, I look forward
to visiting her

20:45.657 --> 20:47.190
and her wife...
On their farm.

20:47.258 --> 20:48.458
Jacqueline?

20:48.526 --> 20:49.926
Like, named after you?

20:49.994 --> 20:51.995
Like a little Jack,
but with boobs?

20:52.062 --> 20:55.732
Hi, I'm Daphne Donaghy
I saw a turtle!

20:55.799 --> 20:57.166
Kylie.
Great.

20:57.234 --> 20:59.101
She can strip her way
through community college.

20:59.169 --> 21:00.369
Come on.

21:00.437 --> 21:03.039
Oh, I don't know
about Christina.

21:03.107 --> 21:04.540
'Cause then everyone
calls her Tina.

21:04.608 --> 21:07.543
And every Tina I've known
is a real judgmental bitch.
