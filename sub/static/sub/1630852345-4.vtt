-[crackling]

00:33.158 --> 00:36.995
Which it might not be,
because this thing is totally busted.

00:37.078 --> 00:38.747
I said "if."

00:38.830 --> 00:41.166
Apparently, we're on an island
in the South Pacific

00:41.249 --> 00:42.959
so small it doesn't have a name.

00:43.543 --> 00:46.004

Who's ready for a morning dip?

00:55.472 --> 00:57.515
Tony, are you okay?

00:57.599 --> 00:59.100
Yeah. Yeah, I feel great.

00:59.184 --> 01:02.062
I had this crazy dream
where you were driving a submarine,

01:02.145 --> 01:06.191
and I had a band with these fish, and
there was a real heartbreaker of a squid.

01:06.274 --> 01:07.567
Wait, where are we?

01:09.194 --> 01:11.321
What do you remember about Sudarikov?

01:11.404 --> 01:14.365
Yeah. Why did he have you
strapped into that thing?

01:14.449 --> 01:15.366
What thing?

01:15.450 --> 01:18.119
-You were hooked up to some machine.
-What machine?

01:18.203 --> 01:20.872
It looked like he was
stealing something from your brain.

01:20.955 --> 01:23.625
-Why would he want to do that?
-Why would anyone?

01:23.708 --> 01:26.628
He's mad about the crystal
you stole from his owl's apartment.

01:26.711 --> 01:27.545
You stole it too!

01:27.629 --> 01:32.634
Do you remember anything about being
on his plane, or jumping on our plane,

01:32.717 --> 01:36.387
or the plane crash, or… well,
what's the last thing you remember?

01:36.471 --> 01:39.641
I-I was driving.
Like, through LA, but it was in a dream.

01:39.724 --> 01:41.935
Dom was kidnapped,
and I was trying to save him.

01:42.018 --> 01:43.770
He was hooked up to that machine.

01:43.853 --> 01:46.481
Maybe it was some kind of
immersive VR video game.

01:46.564 --> 01:50.735
Man, who come I never get kidnapped
while playing an awesome AR video game,

01:50.819 --> 01:54.072
and forced to play
an even awesomer VR video game?

01:54.155 --> 01:56.324
We should get you to a doctor
for a checkup,

01:56.407 --> 01:58.910
but I don’t think we're driving
to urgent care in this.

01:58.993 --> 02:01.538
Yeah, again, it's busted.

02:01.621 --> 02:03.373
Can you be more specific?

02:03.456 --> 02:07.961
The air vents are clogged with plastic.
That's a real global crisis, bro.

02:08.044 --> 02:10.672
The exterior is damaged from
torpedoes and depth charges,

02:10.755 --> 02:13.842
and the internal components are fried
from seawater and pressure.

02:13.925 --> 02:16.302
It's not gonna be usable
as a submarine for a while.

02:16.386 --> 02:17.720
So what are we gonna do?

02:17.804 --> 02:20.849
We're gonna have to call
Ms. Nowhere and Palindrome for help.

02:20.932 --> 02:22.851
Oh, she's not gonna like that.

02:22.934 --> 02:24.185
There's no other way.

-We're marooned.

Oh, these crickets we picked up from
that boat market in Cambodia are terrible.

02:52.088 --> 02:53.172
Not enough cumin.

02:54.841 --> 02:57.343
-Mm.
-I've had worse.

02:57.427 --> 03:00.138
Oh yeah? What's the worst thing
you ever ate on a stakeout?

03:00.221 --> 03:01.973
You ever try jellyfish jerky?

03:02.056 --> 03:06.185
Jellyfish jerky? That's like filet mignon!

03:06.269 --> 03:10.773
Try some fried tarantula thorax
before you badmouth jellyfish jerky.

03:10.857 --> 03:14.777
Tarantula thorax?
You mean the kettle corn of the desert?

03:14.861 --> 03:18.406
You really want a bad snack,
try a nice bowl of spleen dip.

03:18.489 --> 03:20.366
What kind of spleen?

03:20.450 --> 03:24.829
Uh, gray? But the worst part,
they served it with kale chips.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.831
No! There's no such thing.

03:26.915 --> 03:29.876
Right? Kale's not a chip,
it's a goldarn leaf.

03:29.959 --> 03:32.629
You are preaching to the choir, my friend.

Stop it. It's the emergency line.

I'll set the timer on the C-4.

03:50.188 --> 03:51.773
[Ms. Nowhere] No, wait. Look.

03:51.856 --> 03:53.608
He doesn't seem nervous.

03:53.691 --> 03:55.818
And there are no alarms.

03:55.902 --> 03:59.739
I think this whole island city
just became one big Faraday cage.

03:59.822 --> 04:02.700
Sudarikov is blocking
communications in or out.

04:02.784 --> 04:05.870
Something's about to go down.

04:05.954 --> 04:09.999
If we're gonna find out what's going on,
we have to go undercover to get inside.

04:10.583 --> 04:15.213
[Palindrome] I can't answer the phone
right now, but know that you're not alone.

04:15.296 --> 04:16.130
I'm listening.

04:16.756 --> 04:17.632
[sighs]

04:17.715 --> 04:19.008
Did you finally get him?

04:19.092 --> 04:21.469
No, but he gets me.

04:21.552 --> 04:23.721
Anyway, looks like
we're on our own for a while.

04:23.805 --> 04:26.933
Let's scout the island. There may be
a village where we can resupply.

04:27.016 --> 04:28.768
Ooh, maybe there's a pizza place!

04:28.851 --> 04:32.188
Aw, but do you think
they'll just have Hawaiian pizza out here?

04:32.272 --> 04:33.731
I don't like hot pineapple.

04:33.815 --> 04:36.317
We'll be able to see better
from the top of that hill.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.069
[Echo] That's a long hike.

04:38.152 --> 04:39.862
Who said anything about hiking?

04:39.946 --> 04:41.155
We can drive!

04:41.239 --> 04:43.116

We don't look very much like these two.

04:55.628 --> 04:58.631
Doesn't matter.
We'd still have to pass the retina scan.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.426
It's been a minute since
I yanked a bad guy's eyeball out.

05:01.509 --> 05:05.930
Easy, smash and grab! I'm making some
contact lenses that will get us through.

05:06.014 --> 05:08.975
Ugh! I hate putting in contacts.

a little more careful

than just strolling down
the middle of Main Street.

Layla, according to
the Yoka Tropical Tango ad,

06:05.364 --> 06:07.450
island cultures are very friendly.

06:07.533 --> 06:09.869
Yeah. They sleep in hammocks.
They invented chill.

06:09.952 --> 06:13.790
In the ad, they're also cartoon bears,
or whatever.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.541

06:15.625 --> 06:17.210
Koalas are bears!

Nuh-uh! They're marsupials!

we don't know enough about islands.

Of all the banana traps
in all the islands in all the Pacific,

09:06.546 --> 09:08.130
I walk into theirs.

09:08.214 --> 09:09.549
What happened back there?

09:09.632 --> 09:11.259
[spluttering] I don't know.

09:11.342 --> 09:13.970
I touched the wheel,
and suddenly I was back in the game.

09:14.554 --> 09:18.057
I think they did something to my brain.
I can't drive! [gasping]

09:18.140 --> 09:20.184
Easy, Tony. Breathe. It's okay.

09:20.268 --> 09:23.813
I've dealt with agents' brains getting
scrambled by evil machinery in the past.

09:23.896 --> 09:25.982
You need to work your way
up the panic ladder.

09:26.566 --> 09:29.193
What if I can never drive again?
Will I even be a Toretto?

09:29.277 --> 09:32.238
Your Aunt Maria doesn't drive.
She's still a Toretto.

09:32.321 --> 09:36.117
That's because she's 90 years old.
And in jail. For stealing cars!

09:36.200 --> 09:38.202
[groans in frustration]

09:38.286 --> 09:41.122
We got bigger problems
than Tony's messed up nugget.

Scadan will be hunting us down.
The island isn't that big.

09:43.958 --> 09:47.295
It won't take long to find the hauler.
We need to get out of here, fast.

09:47.378 --> 09:51.966
It seems my powers of healing
are needed two places at once.

09:52.049 --> 09:54.343
We might be able to
fix them both the same way.

I'll work on Tony.

Eh…

10:02.018 --> 10:05.146
Uh, please don't hit the hauler computer
with the wrench.

-Re… Chill.

Now, I want you to realize
that wasn't really Dom.

-[soft music continues]
-None of that was real.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.615
It was all an illusion.

Relax…

10:59.659 --> 11:02.119
Ah, what's happening?
Is this hammock moving?

11:02.203 --> 11:05.831
I don't know how to drive this thing, man!

11:12.338 --> 11:13.214
Okay.

11:13.297 --> 11:16.175
Now, think back. You were chasing me.

11:16.258 --> 11:20.471
Yeah, and I could never catch up.
They had Dom, and I couldn't save him.

11:20.554 --> 11:22.598
Tell me how you feel.

11:23.516 --> 11:27.645
[tearfully] I'm sorry, Dom.
I failed you. I'm not a Toretto.

nothing to do with what you do in a car.

[Frostee] Being a Toretto
is about what's in here.

12:04.515 --> 12:08.352
Honestly, I'm more worried about
how many concussions that boy has.

He'll be back soon.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.301
[sighs] Maybe we should
go looking for him.

13:22.384 --> 13:26.472
He's so fragile. Like a little baby bird.

He's not gonna learn to fly
with you babying him.

You're pushing him out the nest

We need to focus on getting
the hauler back up and running
