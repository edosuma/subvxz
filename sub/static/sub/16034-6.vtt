WEBVTT

01:28.440 --> 01:29.941
(Sobs)

01:52.120 --> 01:54.463
Still can't get used to Mister Francis bein' gone.

01:54.640 --> 01:58.428
Breaks my heart to think of him,
all fired up about those rock samples.

01:58.600 --> 02:02.468
When in the end, 'twas only quartz,
with schorl an' iron oxide mixed.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.668
- Fool's copper.
- Fool's copper.

02:06.680 --> 02:10.548
Leaving his widow with nothing
but debt and shares in a failing mine.

02:29.240 --> 02:31.379
I'm to Trenwith, to see Elizabeth.

02:31.560 --> 02:34.506
Is Verity's company not enough for her?

02:34.680 --> 02:36.545
Hup!

03:06.480 --> 03:08.505
He comes to take Geoffrey Charles to the mine.

03:08.680 --> 03:09.749
And you?

03:10.600 --> 03:15.219
I'm trustee of my son's shares in Wheal Grace,
which is why Ross brings me weekly reports.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.300
Sometimes twice-weekly.

03:17.960 --> 03:19.905
Uncle Ross is here, Mama!

03:20.720 --> 03:22.585
Who else can I depend on?

03:31.400 --> 03:33.664
(Hums cheerfully)

03:34.400 --> 03:36.140
Is it done?

03:36.320 --> 03:39.300
"Mr Poldark, I give you notice

03:39.480 --> 03:44.258
that your promissory note
for 1 ,000 plus interest at 40%,

03:44.440 --> 03:49.059
will fall due and must be paid in full."

03:49.240 --> 03:50.901
The day after Christmas?

03:52.160 --> 03:54.822
Do they serve plum pudding in debtors' prison?

03:55.000 --> 03:56.183
(Chuckles grimly)

03:59.880 --> 04:01.780
Will you take my coat?

04:01.960 --> 04:04.349
- I do not feel the cold.
- I think you do.

04:04.520 --> 04:06.738
At any rate, you used to.

04:07.520 --> 04:09.829
At any rate, it's warmer than Trenwith.

04:12.400 --> 04:15.028
I must learn to grow a thicker skin.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.347
Can you?

04:18.960 --> 04:20.700
Sometimes.

04:25.360 --> 04:27.225
I miss Francis.

04:30.680 --> 04:32.022
I miss him too.

04:32.200 --> 04:36.546
I never thought him the most practical of men,
yet now I realise how much he dealt with.

04:36.720 --> 04:41.305
Matters offinance, the estate, the servants...
decisions which now fall to me.

04:41.480 --> 04:43.300
Do not hesitate to call upon me, Elizabeth.

04:43.480 --> 04:46.062
Oh, I do. More often than I should.

04:46.760 --> 04:49.422
You have your own home, and wife and child.

04:49.600 --> 04:53.184
You seek to share my troubles,
yet never tell me your own.

04:53.360 --> 04:55.260
What of your debts?

04:55.440 --> 04:57.863
The promissory note
which fell into George's hands?

04:58.560 --> 05:02.508
Don't trouble yourself.
The sum was much exaggerated.

05:03.640 --> 05:05.267
And the mine?

05:05.440 --> 05:08.466
How long can we continue with such poor yield?

05:08.640 --> 05:12.542
For your sake and his, I will squeeze
out every last drop before it defeats us.

05:14.960 --> 05:17.781
Uncle Ross looks after us so well.

05:17.960 --> 05:19.939
Where would we be without him?

05:45.520 --> 05:48.307
Oi, maid, even your oils and vittles?

05:49.480 --> 05:52.938
Not a word to Ross.
I don't want him thinkin' I fear the worst.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.259
'Ee do fear the worst!
If he go to prison,

05:55.440 --> 05:57.465
we'll need more'n a few tetties
to see us through.

05:57.640 --> 05:59.426
Hush your creenin'!

05:59.600 --> 06:03.149
Ifthis be his last Christmas here for a while,
I mean to make it a goodly one.

06:15.880 --> 06:18.542
- Dr Enys.
- Is it anyone we know?

06:18.720 --> 06:20.187
Nay, sir.

06:20.360 --> 06:23.989
Say he may be from the Parthesia.
It was wrecked last night off St Ann's.

06:24.160 --> 06:26.378
A cryin' waste 0' life, don't 'ee think, Dr Enys?

06:27.680 --> 06:29.580
I do indeed, Rosina.

06:44.720 --> 06:46.585
Take Rosina home. I'll see him buried.

06:50.160 --> 06:56.224
Nay, Rosina, 'tis needful 'ee take my arm,
for fear thy lipsy leg do buckle beneath 'ee.

07:26.040 --> 07:29.305
Oh, yes...Pascoe's asked to see me.

07:30.360 --> 07:34.023
He's received word from the Warleggans
regarding my promissory note.

07:34.560 --> 07:39.907
Could we not appeal to our wealthier friends,
at least to save you from debtors' prison?

07:40.640 --> 07:42.107
Speak to people!

07:42.280 --> 07:44.145
That's not how I work.

07:44.320 --> 07:47.346
So it's against your principles?
Nay, Ross, 'tis against your pride!

07:47.520 --> 07:49.943
This stew is excellent.

08:12.040 --> 08:13.860
Of course.

08:14.040 --> 08:15.826
It's obvious.

08:16.960 --> 08:18.507
- Argh!
- What do 'ee do to her?

08:18.680 --> 08:21.422
Rosina? Can you stand?

08:22.400 --> 08:24.823
Don't be afraid.
I'll be here to catch you.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.742
Nay, surgeon. If anyone shall, 'tis I.

08:29.800 --> 08:33.019
Ah...I think...

08:33.200 --> 08:35.225
I believe...

08:44.000 --> 08:45.945
What did 'ee do?

08:46.720 --> 08:50.588
- 'Tis all mended. There be no pain.
- There was a displacement.

08:50.760 --> 08:53.422
You had it so long, the muscles
withered and caused inflammation.

08:53.600 --> 08:57.309
I'll put a bandage on it for now,
but soon you'll be able to manage without.

08:57.480 --> 08:59.107
'Tis a miracle!

08:59.280 --> 09:02.181
No. Basic anatomy.

09:16.680 --> 09:18.420
There seem to be soldiers everywhere.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.865
Events across in France
make the gentry nervous.

09:22.040 --> 09:24.907
Events along the coast
make the gaugers watchful.

09:28.120 --> 09:31.021
- Has it arrived?
- As expected.

09:31.200 --> 09:34.101
The full amount, with interest.

09:34.280 --> 09:39.183
- I did enquire whether the Warleggans...
- I can guess the response.

09:40.800 --> 09:42.301
Quite so.

09:42.480 --> 09:46.462
It's to be paid six weeks hence.
The day afer Christmas.

09:55.880 --> 09:57.268
How are you, Tonkin?

09:58.440 --> 10:01.068
Good of you to call, Cap'n. Few others do.

10:01.800 --> 10:04.701
You've no notion how much your visits
have helped me through.

10:07.520 --> 10:09.420
Not to mention this.

10:10.920 --> 10:12.262
Bless you, sir.

10:12.440 --> 10:15.102
- When do you expect to be released?
- Soon afer Christmas.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.259
Then it will be your turn to visit me.

10:18.680 --> 10:21.706
George Warleggan has a bill of mine
which I cannot pay.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.347
Surely you have assets?

10:23.520 --> 10:25.101
Your shares in Wheal Leisure?

10:25.280 --> 10:26.781
Does the mine not prosper?

10:26.960 --> 10:31.420
My shares are worth about 600,
not even half ofwhat I owe.

10:31.600 --> 10:34.546
Besides, I would not give them the satisfaction.

10:34.720 --> 10:36.460
Then you will suffer.

10:37.960 --> 10:39.666
Then I will suffer.

10:46.440 --> 10:49.227
- Ah! Miss Penvenen.
- Captain Poldark.

10:49.400 --> 10:52.301
Seven months away
have given me an appetite for such sights.

10:52.480 --> 10:55.028
And doubtless they for you.

10:56.560 --> 10:59.063
I was most grieved
to hear of your cousin's death.

10:59.240 --> 11:00.901
Thank you.

11:01.080 --> 11:02.945
We miss him greatly.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.748
He was your partner in the mine, I believe?

11:05.920 --> 11:07.865
Were you able to continue the venture?

11:08.040 --> 11:10.019
It goes on.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.748
- Profitably?
- Not profitably.

11:13.920 --> 11:17.139
- And how is Dr Enys?
- A worker of miracles!

11:17.320 --> 11:21.029
I just came through Sawle and I heard tell
of his curing a village girl of her lameness.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.861
Rosina Hoblyn?

11:23.040 --> 11:26.669
- You know her?
- Of her. How was it done?

11:27.400 --> 11:30.426
No doubt Dr Enys will enlighten you
soon enough.

11:30.600 --> 11:31.988
(Spurs horse on)

11:41.800 --> 11:44.143
Did you know Caroline had returned?

11:45.360 --> 11:49.148
(Clears throat)
As a matter offact, yes.

11:51.320 --> 11:56.189
The attachment's bad, I know,
and it's my weakness but I cannot shake it.

11:57.080 --> 11:59.742
No doubt it will end badly
and I'll have myjust deserts.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.785
Possibly.

12:01.960 --> 12:04.542
It seems fate does as it pleases.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.421
And it has nothing to do
with strength or weakness shown.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.739
Take Francis.

12:10.920 --> 12:13.662
Was there ever a sorrier or less deserved end?

12:15.280 --> 12:20.149
To walk out ofthis house and in an hour,
to drown like a dog in a well?

12:20.320 --> 12:23.107
And for nothing.
That's... That's what I most deplore,

12:23.280 --> 12:25.464
the wanton, useless waste of it.

12:25.640 --> 12:27.267
The quirks offate...

12:28.560 --> 12:31.586
..which make nonsense of all our striving.

12:39.040 --> 12:41.702
95 years of age. What do you think ofthat?

12:43.520 --> 12:47.024
I think it's high time the coffin-maker
started taking measurements.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.624
Head ofthe family.
Mistress ofthis house.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.620
And so I intend to remain.

12:57.240 --> 12:59.788
Good luck with that, old hag.

13:02.160 --> 13:04.060
(Footsteps approaching)

13:04.800 --> 13:06.381
Elizabeth!

13:08.640 --> 13:10.619
You look pale. Are you unwell?

13:11.480 --> 13:14.222
I've brought a small token for my godson.

13:14.400 --> 13:17.301
- I know you'll accept nothing for yourself.
- Well, I...

13:21.880 --> 13:23.461
Are you looking forward to Christmas?

13:23.640 --> 13:27.827
I wish I were. Entertaining on a grand scale
is not my preference.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.867
But my uncle's very thick with Tony Boscoigne,

13:31.040 --> 13:35.261
and no doubt there's some scheme afoot
to throw me under the hooves of his sisters.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.500
- Or so your mother believes.
- You've seen her?

13:39.880 --> 13:40.983
Oh.

13:41.160 --> 13:43.708
I'd not intended to mention.

13:44.400 --> 13:48.587
I have on occasion over the_ last few months
prevailed upon her to dIne With me.

13:48.760 --> 13:50.739
You know how much I admire her.

13:51.520 --> 13:53.181
She speaks very highly of you.

13:53.360 --> 13:57.979
- She has shared witgrnge certain concerns.

13:58.160 --> 14:01.027
In the wake of Francis...forgive me...

14:01.200 --> 14:05.387
certain outstanding debts of his...
accumulating interest...

14:05.560 --> 14:07.425
- which must be dealt with.
- Of course.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.979
But not until you're out of mourning,
and well beyond.

14:11.160 --> 14:12.741
You're very kind, George.

14:12.920 --> 14:16.026
As your friend, it's the very least I can do.

14:24.200 --> 14:26.179
(Clattering and pounding)

14:27.880 --> 14:30.064
_ HENSHAWE: _
Something amiss With that engine.

14:30.960 --> 14:33.099
I've sent for Trevithick.

14:33.280 --> 14:35.828
Is it worth the while,
given how little she's yielding?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.501
I wonder that.

14:37.680 --> 14:41.229
It's a cryin' shame we never found
that lode Mark Daniel spoke of.

14:42.080 --> 14:43.866
Perhaps he was mistook.

14:44.040 --> 14:46.941
He was an experienced miner.
He knew what he was looking at.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.588
Then it's a pity
he can't be found and asked the question.

14:52.120 --> 14:53.223
Where?

15:04.120 --> 15:06.099
(Grunting and squealing)

15:12.080 --> 15:14.059
Ross continues to vex society.

15:14.240 --> 15:17.380
- What's he done now?
- What has he not done?

15:17.560 --> 15:22.338
Graced the Poldark family pew at church,
taken his seat as magistrate on the bench.

15:22.520 --> 15:25.387
As head ofthe Poldark family,
these things are expected of him.

15:25.560 --> 15:27.585
Oh, you know Ross and expectation!

15:27.760 --> 15:34.700
Besides, I've suspicion he'd think he was more
than fulfillin' his duties in other ways.

15:36.280 --> 15:38.498
Towards Elizabeth, for instance?

15:39.640 --> 15:41.744
Does that trouble you?

15:42.440 --> 15:47.628
Ross never tells me what goes on
in his meetings with her, and I never ask him.

15:48.560 --> 15:50.744
But if you're concerned?

15:50.920 --> 15:55.141
Seems to me that havin' a husband's
a little bit like goin' to church.

15:55.320 --> 15:57.584
You either believe in something or you don't.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.379
And if you don't, then why go at all?

16:01.640 --> 16:06.384
But if you do, then you've no cause
to keep asking for proof.

16:07.560 --> 16:10.302
And do you...believe?

16:11.480 --> 16:13.300
Most ofthe time.

16:24.640 --> 16:27.029
Why don't you smile, Mama?

16:27.200 --> 16:29.703
Well, smiling makes lines upon the face,
my love.

16:29.880 --> 16:31.666
See?

16:31.840 --> 16:34.183
And lines make us look older.

16:34.360 --> 16:39.707
_ So I must smile less.
Not in public, but here, at home.

16:41.640 --> 16:45.667
But when you see me not smiling,
you mustn't think I'm sad or displeased with you,

16:45.840 --> 16:48.741
only that I'm trying to spare my face.

16:49.320 --> 16:52.221
It's important for a lady to look her best.

16:53.240 --> 16:56.380
- Why?
- You'll understand when you're older.

17:38.600 --> 17:41.068
Seven months has seemed a lifetime.

17:41.240 --> 17:43.140
Did my letters not satisfy you?

17:44.000 --> 17:46.389
They evoked pleasure and pain
in equal measure.

17:50.360 --> 17:54.148
Forgive me, I'm a little at sea.

17:54.320 --> 17:58.745
All I know for certain is I'm my own mistress,
yet no freer to follow my heart.

17:58.920 --> 18:04.460
But I'm here, and you're here...
perhaps that's all that matters.

18:05.360 --> 18:07.260
I met your Captain Poldark again.

18:07.440 --> 18:09.101
He told me.

18:10.680 --> 18:13.786
Would you be jealous
ifI said I admired him greatly?

18:13.960 --> 18:18.306
I admire him myself.
He's an exceptional man and a dear friend.

18:19.600 --> 18:22.421
I only wish his circumstances were happier.

18:22.600 --> 18:26.821
Is his cousin's pretty widow the "circumstance",
or is it some other matter?

18:27.000 --> 18:28.547
A financial matter.

18:30.920 --> 18:35.186
And his wife?
She seems to be universally adored.

18:35.360 --> 18:38.340
Is she the sort ofwoman that all men desire
except her husband?

18:39.800 --> 18:43.907
It so ofen happens.
No great incentive for marriage.

18:45.400 --> 18:47.948
Don't you think I'd be ill-advised to try it?

18:48.120 --> 18:50.224
Not if you choose the right man.

18:51.560 --> 18:53.221
Shall I choose a miracle worker,

18:53.400 --> 18:58.224
who now has an adoring Rosina and
a crowd of sickly miners battering his door?

18:58.400 --> 19:03.986
There can't be many physicians of your calibre
who give all their energies to help the poor.

19:05.240 --> 19:07.219
How do you live?

19:08.960 --> 19:14.148
On an income of40 a year from the two mines,
plus whatever my patients can spare me.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.867
I agree it's very little.

19:17.040 --> 19:21.625
Could you not set up in Oxford or Bath,
work among people of your own kind?

19:21.800 --> 19:24.906
Charity is a noble impulse,
but should it not begin at home?

19:25.080 --> 19:29.540
Even in Bath or Oxford, the poor will always
be in greater need of attention than the rich.

19:29.720 --> 19:32.541
Besides, I've no wish to become a society pet.

19:33.920 --> 19:35.660
Is that what you think I am?

19:35.840 --> 19:37.899
No, Caroline.

19:38.880 --> 19:41.986
I would never suggest that,
or wish you to think that I'm...

19:42.160 --> 19:46.187
The most noble of men,
and I the most vacuous ofwomen?

19:47.960 --> 19:50.463
Would you have me pretend
to be other than I am?

19:52.840 --> 19:55.866
I would have you believe
that you're better than you think.

20:00.800 --> 20:01.903
Race me!

20:28.560 --> 20:30.425
Mark Daniel?

20:30.600 --> 20:33.467
'Twould be too rislq, I believe,
for him to return to England.

20:33.640 --> 20:35.858
Have you asked my men for news of him?

20:36.040 --> 20:41.103
I thought I'd come to you first.
Besides, I'm not sure who to trust.

20:41.280 --> 20:44.909
The informer who answers to \_/ercoe
might also report to McNeil.

20:45.080 --> 20:49.062
McNeil claims convalescence,
not the trade, has brought him here.

20:49.240 --> 20:51.743
- Do you believe him?
- Not a jot.

20:53.240 --> 20:55.743
Our trusted band grows smaller.

20:55.920 --> 21:00.141
I removed Vigus.
Now I think to replace Jacka Hoblyn.

21:00.720 --> 21:02.460
Why do you suspect him?

21:02.640 --> 21:06.349
I suspect everyone. 'Tis the safest way.

21:06.520 --> 21:08.784
I think you're mistook.

21:08.960 --> 21:12.100
Jacka's a surly fellow,
but I doubt he'd betray his friends.

21:12.280 --> 21:17.468
- Any man'll betray his friends ifthe price is right.
- As Ted knows to his cost.

21:17.640 --> 21:22.748
Ted! How are you?
Have you recovered from your sentence?

21:22.920 --> 21:24.979
Three months' hard labour
do feel like three years.

21:25.160 --> 21:28.266
And still I'm no closer
to knowin' who betrayed me.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.547
But to Mark Daniel.

21:32.720 --> 21:35.860
I could put the word out,
get a letter to him.

21:36.040 --> 21:37.507
I'd be very grateful.

21:37.680 --> 21:39.261
And in exchange?

21:40.120 --> 21:41.826
Yes?

21:42.000 --> 21:43.945
One drawback to your cove.

21:44.120 --> 21:47.544
You've always insisted, haven't you,
that all must be done in a single night?

21:47.720 --> 21:51.144
Don't blame you. But 'tis deuced awkward.

21:51.320 --> 21:55.905
Ifwe could store some ofthe goods
two or three days...

21:56.080 --> 21:59.425
Ten men do in three nights what 30 do in one.

21:59.600 --> 22:01.864
Less chance for the informer.

22:02.920 --> 22:08.187
Bring the cargo ashore and hide it,
if you catch my drift.

22:09.440 --> 22:15.458
We'd be willing to make
a small extra payment for the inconvenience.

22:15.640 --> 22:18.268
A goodwill gesture, so to speak.

22:18.440 --> 22:20.499
How much of a gesture?

22:28.920 --> 22:31.502
A secret cache? On our land?

22:31.680 --> 22:36.060
To store goods during a run
so they can be carried away at leisure.

22:36.240 --> 22:38.822
Or found by the gaugers,
and you carried away in chains!

22:39.560 --> 22:41.778
I'll be in chains regardless soon enough.

22:46.360 --> 22:48.339
Dislike it, Ross.

22:50.200 --> 22:53.909
If I go to prison for debt,
this will mean more money coming in.

22:54.080 --> 22:56.548
The quicker the debt is paid,
the quicker I'm out again.

22:56.720 --> 22:59.666
Unless goods be found in our house,
in which case you'll serve longer!

22:59.840 --> 23:02.866
The cache will be built in the library
and can be done in one night.

23:03.040 --> 23:06.624
Four or five men to dig it,
six or eight to use it thereafter.

23:06.800 --> 23:08.301
And the informer?

23:09.240 --> 23:11.379
Trencrom will hand-pick his men.

23:12.920 --> 23:14.706
And in return?

23:14.880 --> 23:18.509
25 guineas per cargo,
and a promise to find Mark Daniel.

23:18.680 --> 23:21.865
- How will that help?
- He's our last chance offinding copper,

23:22.040 --> 23:24.179
of making the mine pay.

23:24.360 --> 23:27.466
If Grace fails, how will I repay the Warleggans?

23:27.640 --> 23:29.619
Why can you not appeal to your friends?

23:29.800 --> 23:33.588
Ray Penvenen,
Horace Treneglos, even Trencrom?

23:34.000 --> 23:36.548
Would they not put up the money
to save you from bankruptcy?

23:36.720 --> 23:39.348
- The sum is too great.
- You mean your pride is!

23:40.720 --> 23:45.908
No one of sense, however much a friend,
would loan money to a man with a failing mine,

23:46.080 --> 23:49.140
for the simple reason
that they would never get it back.

23:49.320 --> 23:55.179
But if I could demonstrate that the mine might
prosper, I could borrow against its better days.

23:57.200 --> 23:59.179
Until we find Mark Daniel.

24:00.680 --> 24:03.387
- Do I have your consent?
- You dare to ask me that?

24:03.560 --> 24:08.429
Knowin' very well you do exactly
what you please, with or without my say?

24:17.600 --> 24:21.388
Were you ever involved
in Ross Poldark's copper smelting venture?

24:22.800 --> 24:26.145
I made a minor investment.

24:27.200 --> 24:31.341
It was an ill-conceived enterprise.
Everyone lost money.

24:32.240 --> 24:33.867
Except the Warleggans.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.467
Why do you ask?

24:36.640 --> 24:38.904
I believe Ross Poldark has some debt
from that time.

24:39.080 --> 24:41.628
The Warleggans acquired it
and are pressing for bankruptcy.

24:41.800 --> 24:43.381
You're very well informed.

24:44.360 --> 24:46.385
Less than I'd like to be.

24:47.200 --> 24:50.658
No doubt Dr Enys could enlighten you further.

24:53.840 --> 24:56.104
I shall go to Truro tomorrow.

24:56.280 --> 24:59.147
It's a poor place to shop
but I need new buckles for my shoes.

24:59.320 --> 25:02.869
- You are your own mistress now, Caroline.
- So I am.

25:03.040 --> 25:08.945
Though...I think you should not allow
a natural pleasure in your new freedom

25:10.120 --> 25:13.669
to override the requirements of good conduct.

25:15.120 --> 25:21.867
To ride far and unattended in the company
of a young man of eligible years

25:22.040 --> 25:26.147
is to invite comment of an unsavoury nature.

25:27.120 --> 25:29.259
No doubt it was innocently done,

25:29.440 --> 25:35.822
but it is neither fair to me,
who may seem to countenance it,

25:36.000 --> 25:42.428
or to the young man himself, who may derive
from it ambitions beyond his proper sphere.

25:46.120 --> 25:48.862
Thank you for your concern, Uncle.

25:49.040 --> 25:51.668
If my conduct so bothers you,

25:51.840 --> 25:54.980
would it not be better
for me to quit this house and live elsewhere?

25:55.160 --> 25:59.984
That would be an excellent solution, were it not
for the great affection we hold for each other.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.378
Uncle Ray is becoming cross with me, Horace.

26:03.560 --> 26:08.224
There will shortly be angry words
which we shall both regret.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.903
Don't you think
we had better change the subject?

26:13.800 --> 26:17.907
At what hour tomorrow
shall you reqUIre the carriage?

26:18.080 --> 26:19.661
At nine.

26:19.840 --> 26:21.546
Thank you, Uncle.

26:24.480 --> 26:30.589
"Dear Dr Enys, I should be obliged
if you would attend on me tomorrow morning

26:30.760 --> 26:34.184
between ten-thirty and eleven...

26:34.360 --> 26:37.545
and oblige Ray Penvenen."

26:45.080 --> 26:48.220
My dears, you do recall
that I'm to return home today?

26:48.400 --> 26:51.858
Fiddlesticks! 'Tis nearly Christmas.

26:52.040 --> 26:54.782
A woman should be with her family at such time.

26:54.960 --> 26:56.541
My husband would agree with you.

26:56.720 --> 26:59.462
Ah! Men. They have business to attend to.

26:59.640 --> 27:01.380
I doubt he's even noticed you're gone.

27:01.560 --> 27:03.744
His letters suggest otherwise.

27:04.440 --> 27:06.340
In any case, I've missed him a great deal,

27:06.520 --> 27:09.023
and have every intention
of making up for lost time.

27:09.200 --> 27:10.781
(Agatha coughs and splutters)

27:14.320 --> 27:15.947
And you?

27:16.920 --> 27:19.343
I have an invitation to Nampara.

27:20.320 --> 27:23.380
- Shall you accept?
- Geoffrey Charles is eager.

27:24.840 --> 27:26.023
Are you?

27:26.800 --> 27:29.667
I think it may do me good
to have some varied company.

27:35.720 --> 27:40.589
- These guests?
- Are specifically chosen for their use to us,

27:40.760 --> 27:44.218
in business, in society, in terms ofthe future.

27:44.400 --> 27:47.585
Arabella Trevelyan, the Honourable
Maria Penrose, Eliza Courtney-Prowse?

27:47.760 --> 27:50.627
- These girls must be all of 17!
- And prime breeding stock.

27:50.800 --> 27:53.780
You may examine their teeth if you choose.

27:55.280 --> 27:56.861
I think I'll ride to Trenwith.

27:58.480 --> 28:00.664
When will you call in the loans on that estate?

28:00.840 --> 28:03.468
What's to be gained
by staying in the good books

28:03.640 --> 28:05.699
of a poverty-stricken widow in her late 20$?

28:05.880 --> 28:09.987
I could alleviate her poverty if I chose,
but I choose to let her feel it.

28:11.880 --> 28:14.269
She has made her bed
and now she must lie in it.

28:19.320 --> 28:21.299
(Demelza grunts)

28:23.640 --> 28:25.505
Agh.

28:26.600 --> 28:28.579
Oh, Judas!

28:32.200 --> 28:35.340
- Do 'ee read my fortune?
- Aye, maid.

28:35.520 --> 28:40.219
It do tell me, with hands like these,
Demelza Poldark be no lady!

28:41.880 --> 28:43.381
This kindling is damp.

28:43.560 --> 28:46.859
- Has it been seasoned?
- I've no idea.

28:50.440 --> 28:52.385
Of course not.

28:56.520 --> 28:59.341
I'm glad to see you allow yourself some luxuries.

28:59.520 --> 29:03.627
Oh...no. It is a present for Geoffrey Charles,

29:03.800 --> 29:05.665
from George.

29:05.840 --> 29:08.388
Oh, has he been here?

29:08.560 --> 29:11.779
I had to admit him, Ross.
He's my chief creditor.

29:11.960 --> 29:15.828
- And his views on your debts?
- Very generous. They always have been.

29:16.400 --> 29:20.666
He offered to waive the interest indefinitely.
Of course I could not accept.

29:20.840 --> 29:23.229
My quarrel with George is not your quarrel.

29:25.040 --> 29:28.749
If he wants to win your approval, let him.
You don't have to like him.

29:32.120 --> 29:34.907
- (Elizabeth exhales)
- You're shivering.

29:35.760 --> 29:37.785
I wish I could help you.

29:37.960 --> 29:39.905
For my own sake, I can bear it.

29:40.080 --> 29:43.504
But for my son, for his future...

29:44.000 --> 29:47.219
When Francis came into his estate,
there was money to live on,

29:47.400 --> 29:49.903
comfort, dignity.

29:51.600 --> 29:55.548
It breaks my heart to think that
Geoffrey Charles will have so little to his name.

29:56.400 --> 29:58.379
It breaks my heart too.

29:59.320 --> 30:01.584
There's nothing to be done, is there?

30:05.080 --> 30:09.904
My remaining shares in Wheal Leisure.
What would you say is their worth?

30:10.080 --> 30:12.742
Upwards of600.

30:14.120 --> 30:15.747
Sell them.

30:15.920 --> 30:17.785
You wish to devote the money to Wheal Grace?

30:17.960 --> 30:19.507
No.

30:19.680 --> 30:21.989
To a special purpose.

30:22.800 --> 30:26.702
Francis's widow and family are in dire need.

30:26.880 --> 30:28.381
More so than yours?

30:28.560 --> 30:32.940
Two years ago, Francis sank his last 600
into Wheal Grace.

30:34.040 --> 30:36.179
I want Elizabeth Poldark to have it back.

30:36.360 --> 30:39.500
- Will she accept?
- Of course not,

30:39.680 --> 30:41.500
which is why I need your help.

30:42.800 --> 30:45.940
When my shares in Wheal Leisure are sold,

30:46.120 --> 30:49.100
you'll make an offer
for Geoffrey Charles's holding in Wheal Grace,

30:49.280 --> 30:53.228
on behalf of an anonymous client
whom you represent.

30:53.400 --> 30:57.143
Elizabeth will accept,
and the money can be transferred to her.

30:57.320 --> 31:00.187
So do I understand you aright?

31:00.360 --> 31:08.267
You are offering 600 for a half share
in a mine which is about to close,

31:08.440 --> 31:14.902
when you owe George Warleggan, the man
who will happily see you in debtors' prison,

31:15.080 --> 31:17.822
- 1 ,400?
- Correct.

31:19.200 --> 31:23.944
As your banker and friend,
I must advise against.

31:24.120 --> 31:28.466
You cannot afford it. And you have
your own wife and child to care for.

31:28.640 --> 31:32.349
Would it not seem as ifyou value
your cousin-in-law's comfort ahead of hers?

31:32.520 --> 31:36.229
It might, ifI chose to tell her, which I do not.

31:39.160 --> 31:41.902
I am here. Francis is not.

31:42.880 --> 31:46.429
Demelza has resources
which Elizabeth does not.

31:46.600 --> 31:49.979
She's a miner's daughter.
She has learnt to survive.

31:51.120 --> 31:52.826
Elizabeth is a gentlewoman.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.184
And you are a madman.

31:55.360 --> 31:58.909
A madman who can now _order his life
With a clear conSCIence.

32:24.000 --> 32:29.859
My niece is in Truro.
I have taken the opportunity to summon you.

32:30.040 --> 32:32.668
I imagine you've some idea Why?

32:32.840 --> 32:34.626
I don't think it's for me to speculate, sir.

32:34.800 --> 32:38.509
I might Wish you'd shown such delicacy
in all your dealings.

32:38.680 --> 32:40.307
I'm sorry you think I have not.

32:41.200 --> 32:44.943
I refer to your friendship with my niece.

32:47.320 --> 32:49.026
In what way do you consider that offensive?

32:49.200 --> 32:53.625
Oh, come, sir. You cannot be ignorant
ofthe ways ofthe world.

32:54.360 --> 32:57.864
AS for a serious attachment...

32:59.160 --> 33:00.866
..With a young man of your station...

33:01.040 --> 33:03.747
- I am a gentleman, sir.
- And she is an heiress!

33:05.880 --> 33:12.149
Much too important a person to be entangled
with a penniless country doctor like yourself.

33:12.320 --> 33:13.867
Is that not for her to decide?

33:14.040 --> 33:17.385
Caroline must marry with my consent,

33:17.560 --> 33:20.666
otherwise she will not inherit a penny.

33:21.480 --> 33:26.907
She has been brought up
in the greatest possible luxury.

33:27.080 --> 33:32.666
Do you suppose that she'll sacrifice that
for the little you have to offer?

33:32.840 --> 33:34.467
She has given me cause to suppose so.

33:34.640 --> 33:37.143
Or you may think
she has a private fortune of her own.

33:37.320 --> 33:41.427
- I neither know nor care What she has.
- 6,000. 6,000.

33:41.600 --> 33:43.420
All you'd get if you married her.

33:45.280 --> 33:46.827
Until now,

33:47.000 --> 33:50.709
I've suffered your comments with a due
degree of civility, but there are limits, sir.

33:51.400 --> 33:54.426
God knows I've never given you cause
to suppose me a fortune hunter,

33:54.600 --> 33:58.661
and if you imagine that no man Without an eye to
her inheritance could fall in love With your niece,

33:58.840 --> 34:02.788
then you greatly underrate her charms
and insult us both.

34:02.960 --> 34:06.020
Well, I hope I have made my views clear.

34:06.200 --> 34:08.907
And in doing so you have given me hope.

34:09.880 --> 34:12.428
Caroline's fortune is less than I thought.
I'm glad of it.

34:12.600 --> 34:16.343
A penniless doctor could wed such a fortune
yet not be eclipsed by it.

34:20.600 --> 34:24.661
You will leave this house now, sir,
and you'll never return.

34:24.840 --> 34:26.740
You will cease all communication With my niece.

34:26.920 --> 34:29.059
Caroline is of age, sir.

34:29.240 --> 34:32.459
Your control may be exercised
within these walls, but not beyond.

34:34.160 --> 34:39.826
I see I have gravely mistaken your character,
Dr Enys.

34:40.840 --> 34:43.866
But at least now we understand each other.

34:45.960 --> 34:47.461
Oh, yes, sir.

34:47.640 --> 34:49.949
Now we understand each other.

34:58.720 --> 35:01.746
London is so diverting. I may well
take a house for the season next year.

35:01.920 --> 35:05.139
May I hope to be honoured
by a visit from yourself?

35:05.320 --> 35:08.778
I'd be delighted, sir, and I'd like to think
Elizabeth could be persuaded.

35:08.960 --> 35:10.621
Once she's out of mourning?

35:10.800 --> 35:15.339
But I dare not hope for it. She's been closeted
away at Trenwith for so long.

35:15.520 --> 35:22.744
Yet society deserves to see more
of its rarest treasures, yourself included.

35:25.160 --> 35:27.105
Oh'
(Laughs)

35:35.120 --> 35:36.462
Goodbye, little man.

35:36.640 --> 35:40.508
Look after your mama this Christmas.
It's what your papa would wish.

35:42.280 --> 35:44.305
You may think me interfering,
but I urge you

35:44.480 --> 35:46.869
to_let Ross and Demelza
keep this Christmas to themselves.

35:47.040 --> 35:50.180
- But... _
- For your sake as well as theirs.

36:46.280 --> 36:48.225
Nothing will happen till nightfall.

36:49.800 --> 36:52.462
- Well, that do make all the difference!
- Demelza...

37:27.720 --> 37:31.508
What can I do? _
I can't beg for money. I can't earn it.

37:31.680 --> 37:34.899
I can't dig for it. I can't tell him not to dig.

37:36.320 --> 37:38.140
What use am I?

37:38.600 --> 37:41.467
He_should'v_e wed someone
like Caroline Penvenen.

37:45.320 --> 37:49.381
I've know'd Cap'n Ross since he were a Whelp.

37:49.560 --> 37:51.300
Since his mother died.

37:51.480 --> 37:56.258
She was a good soul, an' a Wise,
an' I know What she'd say.

37:56.440 --> 37:59.022
- What?
- That her lad had met his match.

38:00.120 --> 38:02.099
Mebbe that was true once, but now...

38:02.800 --> 38:06.099
- ..now I'm his torment.
- And she'd say, serve him right.

38:06.880 --> 38:08.939
I could crown him.

38:09.120 --> 38:11.145
An' he scarcely knows I'm there.

38:11.320 --> 38:12.708
(Knocking)

38:12.880 --> 38:14.745
Prudie! Don't answer it!

38:16.000 --> 38:20.300
Oh! Charlie! I did fear it might be the gaugers.

38:20.480 --> 38:22.983
Why would they suspect
a gentleman's house, ma'am?

38:23.640 --> 38:25.426
I come with a message for Cap'n Ross.

38:26.480 --> 38:28.141
Wait here. I'll fetch him.

38:32.080 --> 38:34.469
Ross? There's a visitor.

38:35.760 --> 38:37.387
Charlie!

38:39.840 --> 38:40.909
What is it?

38:41.080 --> 38:44.425
Mr Trencrom say if 'ee Wish to write a letter
to Mark Daniel in France, do so.

38:44.600 --> 38:47.501
I'll see it gets aboard when The One & All sails.

39:56.760 --> 40:00.218
Ross! I'm so glad you're here.
I want to know what I must do.

40:01.760 --> 40:03.546
From Pascoe?

40:03.720 --> 40:06.666
An offer has been made
for Geoffrey Charles's share ofWheal Grace.

40:06.840 --> 40:09.229
It's not the Warleggans.
I've already ascertained that.

40:09.400 --> 40:11.027
Is it not astonishing?

40:11.200 --> 40:12.781
It's a good price.

40:12.960 --> 40:16.862
But that someone should offer as much
for his share as Francis first put into it?

40:17.040 --> 40:19.224
Has there been some new discovery of ore?

40:19.400 --> 40:22.745
Far from it.
Everyone knows we must close soon.

40:22.920 --> 40:27.220
"The prospective buyer is a gentleman
who Wishes to remain nameless

40:27.400 --> 40:30.824
but who has your son's best interest at heart."

40:32.240 --> 40:33.309
Remarkable.

40:33.480 --> 40:35.744
What do you advise?
Should I consider the offer?

40:35.920 --> 40:38.900
Consider? You should accept it without delay.

40:39.920 --> 40:44.619
Our situation here... The money
would make all the difference. But for you?

40:44.800 --> 40:49.499
Are you sure it won't compromise you?
Your new partner, a stranger?

40:49.680 --> 40:54.549
I know you think it best for us, but I'd hate to
think I was taking advantage of our friendship.

40:54.720 --> 40:59.464
Elizabeth, you must sell.
This will enormously ease your situation.

40:59.640 --> 41:03.622
I'm only grateful for your hesitation,
and your loyalty all these months.

41:03.800 --> 41:06.860
Loyalty's not all on one side, Ross,
nor ever has been.

41:12.040 --> 41:15.225
I regret I must decline your invitation
for Christmas.

41:15.400 --> 41:18.824
I believe Francis would want me
to spend it in his house.

41:19.720 --> 41:23.827
And I regret that circumstances are such
that I cannot take care of you as I might Wish.

41:25.240 --> 41:27.219
We both regret that, Ross.

41:56.040 --> 41:59.259
You've had time to consider your position?

42:00.200 --> 42:01.303
I have.

42:01.480 --> 42:04.187
See, Caroline, you... you must understand

42:05.200 --> 42:09.785
that though I might tolerate the young man
on a professional basis,

42:09.960 --> 42:17.219
I cannot permit him to have sight of you again
afer his impudent pretensions to your hand.

42:17.400 --> 42:19.903
I misunderstood his attentions, Uncle.

42:20.800 --> 42:23.746
Now that I apprehend them,
I Will know how to behave in future.

42:23.920 --> 42:25.501
Caroline.

42:42.880 --> 42:44.859
(Horse whinnies)

42:59.320 --> 43:01.584
You're an accomplished rider, Dr Enys.

43:01.760 --> 43:04.866
Clearly such talents would be wasted in city life.

43:05.040 --> 43:07.019
I have other talents which would not.

43:08.160 --> 43:09.900
But you can't bear the thought of Bath.

43:10.080 --> 43:12.548
And you can't bear the thought of marriage.

43:14.480 --> 43:17.620
To a man oftalent, anything is possible.

43:22.560 --> 43:26.018
Without you, nothing is possible.

43:31.520 --> 43:33.465
Hup,hup!

43:44.360 --> 43:47.067
War now seems inevitable.

43:48.640 --> 43:50.301
Merry Christmas, Ross.

43:51.320 --> 43:55.700
Pitt's called out the military.
The French are in Antwerp.

43:55.880 --> 43:57.461
Graw?

43:57.640 --> 43:59.505
What?

43:59.680 --> 44:01.341
Oh...yes...thank you.

44:08.880 --> 44:11.064
I invited Dwight to join us.

44:12.080 --> 44:13.263
Oh?

44:13.440 --> 44:16.386
- He declined.
- Probablyjust as well.

44:16.560 --> 44:19.859
Would have meant two mouthfuls apiece
as opposed to three.

44:20.520 --> 44:24.388
- I expect he's meeting Caroline.
- I expect he is.

44:25.760 --> 44:27.899
From Mr Trencrom.

44:29.320 --> 44:31.140
(Baby gurgles)

44:32.800 --> 44:34.745
Mark Daniel.

44:34.920 --> 44:36.581
Yes?

44:36.760 --> 44:40.821
Apparently he's disappeared
from the face ofthe earth.

44:41.000 --> 44:42.547
Oh.

44:43.840 --> 44:45.546
Leastways now we know.

44:45.720 --> 44:48.746
Yes. Now we know our last hope is gone.

44:58.600 --> 45:00.067
I Wish it could be more, my darling.

45:00.240 --> 45:02.868
Perhaps next Christmas.

45:03.040 --> 45:06.180
Rose-water? Do I require a fumigant?

45:06.360 --> 45:10.182
- No, Aunt, but...
- Francis always knew what I liked.

45:10.360 --> 45:13.386
Brandywine, port and Canary.
Preferably all three.

45:13.560 --> 45:17.701
Oh, how charming!

45:19.600 --> 45:22.068
- Did you make it yourself?
- Yes, Mama.

45:22.240 --> 45:25.346
Just the thing for guarding the fire
and avoiding society!

45:25.520 --> 45:29.342
Then we'll all need one.
Get your needles out, Elizabeth.

45:30.720 --> 45:32.301
Mr George Warleggan.

45:33.120 --> 45:35.065
My compliments ofthe season, dear ladies.

45:35.240 --> 45:37.549
Sit by me, child.

45:38.160 --> 45:40.822
Beware that man's pitchfork and his tail.

45:42.760 --> 45:45.342
I was passing and wondered

45:45.520 --> 45:48.944
ifI might beg the favour
of Elizabeth's company for a few hours?

45:49.120 --> 45:51.338
We have a small gathering at Cardew.

45:51.520 --> 45:53.181
Only if she can be spared, of course.

45:53.360 --> 45:54.987
I fear I cannot.

45:55.160 --> 45:58.140
We intend to keep Christmas quietly,
just among ourselves.

45:58.320 --> 46:04.702
Elizabeth, dear, allow me to assist you
in choosing a suitable gown.

46:11.120 --> 46:12.826
(Lively strings play)

46:34.480 --> 46:37.347
- I wanted to ask your advice.
- Yes?

46:37.840 --> 46:41.025
As Geoffrey Charles's godfather,
I Will of course be responsible

46:41.200 --> 46:43.907
for_ the cost of his education
until he completes univerSIty.

46:44.080 --> 46:48.824
- That's too generous. I cannot allow...
- I was not asking your permission, Elizabeth.

46:49.000 --> 46:52.902
Only your opinion
as to Whether you favour Oxford or Cambridge.

46:54.760 --> 46:56.864
But this is beyond anything, George.

46:58.800 --> 47:03.225
- I don't know What to say.
- Then may I leave you to ponder,

47:03.400 --> 47:06.540
while I fulfil my obligations to Miss Trevelyan?

47:06.720 --> 47:13.899
I believe you know Sir John, Lord Devoran,
MrAlfred Barbary, my Uncle Cary.

47:14.080 --> 47:15.627
Gentlemen.

47:23.000 --> 47:26.663
I suspect it won't be long,
till we see a Mistress George Warleggan.

47:26.840 --> 47:28.421
Odds on it's the Penrose girl.

47:28.600 --> 47:32.024
_ He _wouldn't be satisfied
With anything less than an honourable.

47:32.200 --> 47:34.339
Nor should he be!

47:40.400 --> 47:42.300
I've discussed it with Pascoe.

47:42.480 --> 47:45.347
We wait until late in the day
to tell Cary I cannot pay him.

47:45.520 --> 47:48.182
Then there's a chance they won't come
and arrest me till tomorrow.

47:48.360 --> 47:53.468
So we shall have one final night
at home together.

47:53.640 --> 47:56.188
- Where are you going?
- With you.

47:56.360 --> 48:00.387
If you think you're to play the hero
and face this alone, you're greatly mistook.

48:19.480 --> 48:22.665
Mistress Poldark! This is a surprise.

48:24.080 --> 48:28.619
- Something to fortify you?
- Thank you, I will. I fear I'll need it.

48:30.640 --> 48:34.986
As I told you, the Warleggans
declined to extend the loan.

48:37.120 --> 48:38.781
Thank you.

48:38.960 --> 48:41.269
'Tis my suspicion they care nothing
for the money.

48:41.440 --> 48:43.465
What they want is the man.

48:43.640 --> 48:45.267
And here he is.

48:47.640 --> 48:51.144
And yet I think perhaps...
they may be disappointed.

48:51.320 --> 48:52.821
How?

48:54.640 --> 48:57.461
- I recently received a visit...
- From?

48:57.640 --> 49:01.098
A person who Wishes to remain nameless.

49:03.960 --> 49:06.349
- Harris Pascoe?
- Miss Penvenen.

49:07.280 --> 49:11.182
The proposal I'm instructed to make is this:

49:11.360 --> 49:15.308
to purchase your debt, in full,

49:15.480 --> 49:22.022
and arrange a new promissory note
at a considerably lower rate of interest.

49:22.760 --> 49:25.945
I don't understand. _
How could anyone con5ider that an investment?

49:26.120 --> 49:31.342
The person concerned regards it
as a mark offaith in your prospects and integrity.

49:32.280 --> 49:38.025
Ifyou accept,
the full 1 ,400 will instantly be forthcoming

49:38.200 --> 49:40.703
and you may take it to the Warleggans
this very hour.

49:40.880 --> 49:42.859
But who is this person?
Who would do such a thing?

49:43.040 --> 49:44.428
- Is it you, Harris?
- It is not.

49:44.600 --> 49:47.899
I need your assurance
that no one else will learn ofthis arrangement.

49:48.080 --> 49:49.741
Of course.

49:49.920 --> 49:54.869
- But surely your uncle...
- Your absolute assurance. Can you give it?

49:55.040 --> 49:57.907
Nor am I at liberty to disclose their name.

49:58.080 --> 50:00.423
- It was their express condition.
- Is it someone we know?

50:00.600 --> 50:02.818
- Is it Trencrom?
- Sir Hugh?

50:03.000 --> 50:07.744
The money is available
the moment you sign the new promissory note.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.980
- Is it Horace Treneglos?
- I cannot tell you anything more.

50:13.160 --> 50:17.142
But you, knowin' this person,
do advise us to accept?

50:20.160 --> 50:26.304
But I, knowing this person,
do advise you to accept.

50:33.320 --> 50:35.709
Should we offer him a glass, do you think?

50:35.880 --> 50:38.303
It may be the last good port he has for a While.

50:38.480 --> 50:40.823
Why not? We are gentlemen, after all.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.979
(Chuckles drily)

50:46.040 --> 50:47.667
This way, please, sir.

50:53.080 --> 50:56.538
Good day to you both.
You know my wife, Demelza.

50:56.720 --> 50:59.029
Good day to you, ma'am.
Delighted you can join us.

50:59.200 --> 51:01.065
May I offer you some refreshment?

51:01.240 --> 51:05.859
'Tis most kind ofyou, sir,
but I fear it would not be fitting.

51:08.080 --> 51:11.140
I regret to say I'm unable
to give you the satisfaction...

51:11.320 --> 51:12.582
Most unfortunate.

51:12.760 --> 51:14.978
..of visiting me in prison.

51:17.760 --> 51:19.660
You will have to make do with this.

51:21.320 --> 51:24.539
- What is this foolery?
- Repayment in full,

51:24.720 --> 51:26.426
with interest.

51:27.640 --> 51:30.746
We wish you both
the compliments ofthe season.

51:34.520 --> 51:36.340
How?

51:37.160 --> 51:39.299
How has he managed this?

51:41.000 --> 51:43.582
You told me he had no allies, no friends.

51:43.760 --> 51:46.149
I was evidently wrong.

51:48.400 --> 51:50.379
We will bring him down!

51:51.120 --> 51:56.865
If it takes ten years,
we will see him in the gutter, and his slut.

51:57.040 --> 51:59.543
- We will make it our mission to...
- Compose yourself, Uncle.

51:59.720 --> 52:02.063
Does half of Cornwall
need to hear ofthis small setback?

52:02.240 --> 52:04.902
Small? You call it small?

52:05.080 --> 52:08.026
In the grand scheme ofthings, it is small.

52:08.840 --> 52:12.742
And there are other ways to punish him,
which do not involve money.

52:24.480 --> 52:25.868
From George.

52:38.120 --> 52:39.826
- Prudie?
-Judas!

52:41.320 --> 52:44.505
What's this? A secret cache?

52:44.680 --> 52:46.227
'Twas the maid's notion, sir.

52:46.400 --> 52:50.143
_She bid us not to tell 'e_e.
'Tis against 'ee g0in' to prison.

52:50.320 --> 52:51.662
What else were you not to tell me?

52:51.840 --> 52:56.379
Do 'ee need a list of all the things she do
to keep us safe and fed an' warm an' fitty?

52:58.160 --> 53:02.859
When the moon is on the sea

53:03.040 --> 53:07.386
Kosk yn ta...kosk yn ta

53:07.560 --> 53:12.065
Silver pilchards called to thee

53:12.240 --> 53:16.461
Kosk yn...kosk yn ta

53:17.360 --> 53:21.820
Dream of starry-gazy pie

53:22.880 --> 53:28.068
Kosk yn...kosk yn ta

53:29.000 --> 53:30.820
Shh!

53:31.000 --> 53:35.460
You're right.
I barely notice half ofwhat she does.

53:36.760 --> 53:40.503
Of late, I've barely noticed her at all.

53:53.640 --> 53:56.029
I bought a few things
while you were at the chandler's.

53:56.200 --> 53:58.225
You shouldn't have.

53:58.400 --> 54:00.186
We've so little to spare.

54:09.920 --> 54:11.785
I need no gifts, Ross.

54:13.080 --> 54:15.059
'Tis enough if you still care for me.

54:15.920 --> 54:17.660
Do you doubt it?

54:17.840 --> 54:19.785
I've begun to.

54:20.520 --> 54:23.341
At least, not your liking,

54:23.520 --> 54:26.068
but...mebbe your longing.

54:27.720 --> 54:29.426
You think I no longer love you?

54:31.320 --> 54:33.459
Not in that way.

54:35.280 --> 54:36.907
Open your present.

54:51.040 --> 54:52.826
(Exhales)

54:53.000 --> 54:56.140
What is it? Do you not like them?

54:58.720 --> 55:01.507
They're too fine. Where would I wear them?

55:01.680 --> 55:05.343
- Will they suit you?
- I cannot tell.

55:05.880 --> 55:07.507
Let me see.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.740
If you like.

56:45.760 --> 56:47.899
So you are not to be rid of me, my love.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.389
So I am not to be rid of you, my love.
