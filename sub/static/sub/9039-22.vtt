WEBVTT

00:01.767 --> 00:04.100
- IT'S HEADED
RIGHT FOR THE PIN.

00:04.100 --> 00:06.100
- OH, MAN.

00:06.100 --> 00:07.967
- WHY CAN'T I HIT A BALL
LIKE THAT?

00:07.967 --> 00:09.167
- I COULD ANSWER THAT,

00:09.167 --> 00:12.367
OR YOU COULD JUST LOOK
IN THE MIRROR.

00:13.333 --> 00:15.633
- ALL RIGHT,
WHAT DID I MISS?

00:15.633 --> 00:19.733
- THE SWEDISH GUY
IS STARTING TO CHOKE.

00:19.733 --> 00:21.000
- SWEDISH GUY?

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
WHO TAUGHT HIM HOW TO SWING,
HEIDI?

00:26.000 --> 00:29.033
- ACTUALLY,
HEIDI WAS SWISS.

00:33.933 --> 00:36.567
- GET OUT OF MY CHAIR.

00:36.567 --> 00:38.933
- HEY, ROBERT, CAN YOU
MOVE OVER A LITTLE BIT, PLEASE?

00:38.933 --> 00:40.600
- NO. TAKE THE MIDDLE.
- I DON'T WANT THE MIDDLE.

00:40.600 --> 00:42.000
GIANNI, YOU MOVE OVER
TO THE MIDDLE.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.333
I'LL GO ON THE END.
- JUST SIT DOWN.

00:43.333 --> 00:45.567
- ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE GONNA
FEEL A LITTLE MAN THIGH.

00:45.567 --> 00:47.967
HOW DOES THAT FEEL?
YOU LIKE THAT?

00:47.967 --> 00:49.567
- COME ON!
COOL IT ALREADY.

00:49.567 --> 00:51.300
- PEOPLE, SHUT UP,
ALL OF YOU GUYS.

00:51.300 --> 00:52.933
- WHAT?
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:52.933 --> 00:55.367
- NOTHING. IT'S...

00:55.367 --> 01:00.133
DEBRA'S NOT FEELING WELL
BIO...HORMONALLY.

01:01.600 --> 01:03.700
- OH...GOT IT.

01:03.700 --> 01:08.300
THE ENEMY WITHIN.

01:15.100 --> 01:17.500
- SO...DO ME A FAVOR.

01:17.500 --> 01:19.267
JUST DON'T DO--
DON'T GIVE HER A REASON--

01:19.267 --> 01:20.733
BE COOL. BE COOL. BE COOL.

01:23.767 --> 01:24.633
- HEY, RAY.

01:24.633 --> 01:26.167
THESE WERE ON TOP
OF THE HAMPER.

01:26.167 --> 01:27.800
ARE THEY DIRTY,
OR ARE THEY CLEAN?

01:27.800 --> 01:28.900
- UH, YEAH,
THOSE ARE DIRTY.

01:28.900 --> 01:30.633
- OH, THEY'RE DIR--
OKAY, WELL, THEN, RAY,

01:30.633 --> 01:34.367
LET ME ENLIGHTEN YOU
AS TO HOW A HAMPER WORKS, OKAY?

01:34.367 --> 01:37.400
THERE'S A LID ON IT,
AND THAT LID LIFTS UP.

01:37.400 --> 01:39.767
NOW, YOU TAKE YOUR CLOTHES--
NOT YOUR CLEAN CLOTHES,

01:39.767 --> 01:43.033
NOT THE CLOTHES YOU'RE
WEARING RIGHT NOW,

01:43.033 --> 01:44.767
BUT YOUR DIRTY CLOTHES--

01:44.767 --> 01:47.000
YOU LIFT THAT LID,
YOU INSERT THE CLOTHES,

01:47.000 --> 01:49.300
AND YOU SHUT THAT LID.

01:52.767 --> 01:55.200
- YEAH. GOT IT. GOT IT.

01:55.200 --> 01:56.367
- THIS IS VERY NICE, RAY.

01:56.367 --> 01:57.700
YEAH. THIS IS VERY NICE.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.233
PRETZEL CRUMBS
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

01:59.233 --> 02:00.500
- YEAH, I'M GONNA CLEAN
THOSE UP.

02:00.500 --> 02:03.500
- [laughing]

02:07.567 --> 02:09.800
- OKAY, SEE WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT?

02:09.800 --> 02:12.667
FRICKIN' MOOD SWINGS.

02:12.667 --> 02:14.433
THEY FIND ME CHOPPED UP
IN THE FREEZER,

02:14.433 --> 02:17.033
DON'T BELIEVE
THE SUICIDE NOTE.

02:23.100 --> 02:24.367
- THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL SHOT.

02:24.367 --> 02:26.833
- BOY,
IT'S A ROUGH TIME OF THE MONTH.

02:26.833 --> 02:29.000
YOU KNOW A LOT OF CRIMINALS
TURN THEMSELVES IN

02:29.000 --> 02:32.867
WHEN THEIR WIVES ARE LIKE THIS?

02:32.867 --> 02:34.500
- LOOK,
JUST DO ME A FAVOR.

02:34.500 --> 02:35.667
DON'T BE, LIKE, ANIMALS,
ALL RIGHT?

02:35.667 --> 02:38.667
I DON'T NEED--
- ICEBERG DEAD AHEAD.

02:43.033 --> 02:44.133
- COASTER.

02:44.133 --> 02:45.700
ROBERT, COASTER.

02:45.700 --> 02:48.633
- WHAT?

02:55.267 --> 02:56.600
- NEED HELP?
NEED ANY HELP?

02:56.600 --> 02:58.467
- NO. I'M GOING TO THE BANK,
ALL RIGHT?

02:58.467 --> 03:00.500
LISTEN,
WHEN THE BUZZER GOES OFF,

03:00.500 --> 03:02.200
COULD YOU MAYBE TAKE THE CLOTHES
OUT OF THE DRYER?

03:02.200 --> 03:04.767
- YEAH. NO PROBLEM.
HOW LONG YOU GONNA BE?

03:04.767 --> 03:06.933
- WHY?

03:06.933 --> 03:08.000
- OH, NOTHING.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.367
NO. TAKE YOUR TIME.

03:10.367 --> 03:13.100
OR HURRY BACK IF YOU WANT TO.
IT'S YOUR CHOICE.

03:25.033 --> 03:28.233
- [burps]
AH...

03:28.233 --> 03:32.033
I THOUGHT
SHE'D NEVER LEAVE.

03:32.033 --> 03:36.667
- IS DEBRA AWARE OF HOW
SHE'S COMING OFF TO OTHERS?

03:36.667 --> 03:40.433
- NO, SHE--SHE DOESN'T
HEAR HERSELF.

03:40.433 --> 03:44.000
AND IF I BRING IT UP TO HER,
SHE GETS ALL NUTS AND DENIES IT.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.433
THAT'S THE SICKNESS.

03:46.433 --> 03:49.933
- YOU SHOULD GET HER ON TAPE
AND MAKE HER LISTEN TO IT.

03:49.933 --> 03:51.033
- YOU WANT TO WEAR A WIRE?

03:51.033 --> 03:55.000
I'LL SHAVE YOU DOWN
AND HOOK YOU UP.

03:56.733 --> 03:59.100
- WHY DOESN'T SHE JUST
TAKE SOMETHING FOR THIS?

03:59.100 --> 04:00.467
- WHAT'S SHE GONNA TAKE?

04:00.467 --> 04:05.467
- RAYMOND, HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
IN A DRUGSTORE, HUH?

04:05.467 --> 04:09.733
THERE'S A WHOLE WING
DEDICATED TO THIS PROBLEM.

04:09.733 --> 04:11.233
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT,
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

04:11.233 --> 04:12.733
WHAT AM I GONNA DO,
BUY HER SOMETHING?

04:12.733 --> 04:14.667
BESIDES, I WOULDN'T
EVEN KNOW WHAT TO GET.

04:14.667 --> 04:18.033
- GET 'EM ALL.

04:18.033 --> 04:19.433
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

04:19.433 --> 04:21.100
JUST DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME,
ALL RIGHT?

04:21.100 --> 04:22.767
I'LL JUST RIDE IT OUT.

04:22.767 --> 04:26.867
- YOU DUMB BASTARD.

04:26.867 --> 04:28.167
- WHAT?

04:28.167 --> 04:29.833
- RIDE IT OUT?

04:29.833 --> 04:31.400
YOU PUT A STOP
TO THIS NOW.

04:31.400 --> 04:32.800
- ALL RIGHT, DAD.
ALL RIGHT.

04:32.800 --> 04:35.200
- LET ME ASK YOU,
SHE'S IN A BAD MOOD WHAT,

04:35.200 --> 04:37.767
TWO, THREE DAYS TOPS?

04:37.767 --> 04:39.967
NOT SO TOUGH NOW, RIGHT?

04:39.967 --> 04:40.867
PRETTY SOON,

04:40.867 --> 04:45.033
SHE'S GONNA GET A MOOD
THAT LASTS FIVE DAYS...

04:45.033 --> 04:47.033
THEN IT'S A WEEK.

04:47.033 --> 04:48.633
AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,

04:48.633 --> 04:50.933
WHAT USED TO BE
A BAD MOOD NOW TAKES OVER

04:50.933 --> 04:55.100
AND BECOMES HER ONLY MOOD.

04:55.100 --> 04:56.467
AND THEN...

04:56.467 --> 05:00.333
WELL, THEN YOU BECOME
LIKE ME...

05:00.333 --> 05:02.067
WHERE NOT A DAY GOES BY

05:02.067 --> 05:04.433
THAT I DON'T WISH
THERE WAS A COMET

05:04.433 --> 05:09.567
SCREAMING TOWARDS EARTH
TO BRING ME SWEET RELIEF.

05:13.900 --> 05:15.300
- [dopey laughter]

05:15.300 --> 05:16.733
- WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

05:16.733 --> 05:18.700
- DUMB BASTARD.
HE'S A DUMB BASTARD.

05:23.900 --> 05:27.033
- HEY, BANJOPANTS.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.100
HOPE YOU'RE IN THE MOOD
FOR SOME DELICIOUS ITALIAN,

05:33.100 --> 05:35.533
AND I DON'T MEAN JUST ME.

05:36.967 --> 05:39.333
BIG BAG OF NEMO'S TAKEOUT.

05:39.333 --> 05:40.800
- OH...

05:40.800 --> 05:42.400
- WHAT? I--I WENT BY,

05:42.400 --> 05:44.033
AND I STOPPED,
AND I PICKED UP SOME DINNER.

05:44.033 --> 05:46.433
I ALSO PICKED UP
SOME AFTER-DINNER MINTS...

05:46.433 --> 05:49.433
WHICH FOR YOUR SAKE,
I'VE ALREADY DIPPED INTO.

05:49.433 --> 05:51.100
- BUT I HAVE ALREADY
STARTED DINNER, RAY.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.267
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME
AHEAD OF TIME?

05:53.267 --> 05:55.167
- WHO KNOWS?
BUT LOOK, SURPRISE.

05:55.167 --> 05:56.833
GARLIC BREAD.

05:56.833 --> 05:59.933
- WELL, I'VE MADE A SALAD,
AND I'VE COOKED THE RICE,

05:59.933 --> 06:02.767
BUT...
FORGET IT.

06:02.767 --> 06:06.333
WE'LL EAT YOUR FOOD.

06:13.600 --> 06:15.200
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

06:15.200 --> 06:16.433
- YEAH...FINE.

06:16.433 --> 06:18.733
I'M SORRY.
THANKS FOR THE DINNER.

06:18.733 --> 06:20.433
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

06:20.433 --> 06:23.000
LOOK, I KNOW A LOT
OF STUFF'S GOING ON...

06:23.000 --> 06:26.133
FEMININE-ALLY...

06:29.600 --> 06:32.300
YOU KNOW.

06:32.300 --> 06:34.133
I KNOW IT'S--
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

06:34.133 --> 06:36.567
I UNDERSTAND THAT.
IT'S, UH...

06:36.567 --> 06:40.800
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE
A JEKYLL-AND-HYDE THING...

06:40.800 --> 06:44.800
ONLY MORE...HYDE...

06:44.800 --> 06:46.133
IF HE'S THE BAD ONE.

06:46.133 --> 06:47.133
IT WAS HYDE, RIGHT?

06:47.133 --> 06:48.233
WHATEVER. WHATEVER.

06:48.233 --> 06:49.467
WHOEVER IT IS,
I KNOW IT'S NOT YOU

06:49.467 --> 06:51.333
THAT'S YELLING AT MY FRIENDS
FOR MAKING A MESS

06:51.333 --> 06:53.867
OR GETTING ALL CRAZY
ABOUT CLOTHES ON THE HAMPER.

06:53.867 --> 06:55.267
I KNOW THAT
THAT'S NOT YOU.

06:55.267 --> 06:58.033
THAT'S HYDE...

06:58.033 --> 07:01.700
IF HE WAS
THE BAD ONE.

07:01.700 --> 07:03.233
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:03.233 --> 07:05.733
WHILE--WHILE I WAS OUT TODAY,
I GOT YOU SOMETHING.

07:05.733 --> 07:06.767
I--I REALLY...

07:06.767 --> 07:08.333
I WANT TO HELP YOU
FEEL BETTER, YOU KNOW,

07:08.333 --> 07:11.700
AND...AND--AND THIS SHOULD
TAKE CARE OF ALL YOUR...

07:11.700 --> 07:14.100
SYMPTOMS.

07:19.267 --> 07:23.767
- EXCEPT FOR BITCHY,
RIGHT, RAY?

07:25.967 --> 07:26.900
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

07:26.900 --> 07:31.200
- I MEAN, THERE'S NOTHING
IN HERE FOR BITCHY.

07:37.500 --> 07:40.633
- PROBABLY NEED A PRESCRIPTION
FOR BITCHY.

07:47.033 --> 07:48.633
- BOY, THIS IS
JUST LIKE YOU, RAY.

07:48.633 --> 07:51.833
JUST WHEN I THINK THAT YOU CAN'T
BE ANY MORE INSENSITIVE,

07:51.833 --> 07:53.767
YOU RISE TO THE OCCASION.

07:53.767 --> 07:56.367
- HI, ARE THE KIDS HOME YET?
I'VE GOT COOKIES.

07:56.367 --> 07:59.000
- OH, MAMA, MOM--MOM,
PLEASE, JUST GO HOME.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.133
IT'S NOT A GOOD TIME--

08:00.133 --> 08:01.467
- IT'S OKAY.
SHE CAN STAY IF SHE WANTS.

08:01.467 --> 08:03.233
I'M NOT AFRAID
IF SHE HEARS THIS.

08:03.233 --> 08:06.133
- JEKYLL WOULD BE.

08:06.133 --> 08:08.000
- TELL YOU WHAT,
I CANNOT...

08:08.000 --> 08:09.933
TAKE THIS ANYMORE, OKAY?

08:09.933 --> 08:12.200
YOU MAKE A HUGE MESS,
YOU DON'T HELP ME AT ALL,

08:12.200 --> 08:13.533
YOU INVITE
YOUR FRIENDS OVER

08:13.533 --> 08:15.367
TO DRIVE ME CRAZY
ALL DAY,

08:15.367 --> 08:18.033
AND ALL YOU CAN THINK OF IS,
"OH, SHE MUST HAVE PMS.

08:18.033 --> 08:19.433
LET'S JUST LOAD HER UP
WITH DRUGS."

08:19.433 --> 08:23.100
- NO. IT'S GOT
ST. JOHN'S WARTS IN IT.

08:23.100 --> 08:24.500
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.

08:24.500 --> 08:27.567
IF THERE'S EVER
ANYTHING WRONG, IT'S PMS, HUH?

08:27.567 --> 08:29.500
SOMETIMES--I JUST--
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

08:29.500 --> 08:32.100
SOMETIMES I JUST WANT
TO SMACK YOU.

08:38.100 --> 08:40.733
- DEBRA'S RIGHT, RAYMOND.

08:42.233 --> 08:43.233
I'M SORRY.

08:43.233 --> 08:45.767
- YOU SMACKED ME.
- I KNOW I DID. I'M SORRY.

08:45.767 --> 08:47.667
- WELL, WHAT--UH--
WHAT YOU DO THAT FOR?

08:47.667 --> 08:49.967
- IT'S JUST THAT IT SOUNDS
LIKE YOU'RE BECOMING

08:49.967 --> 08:52.767
JUST LIKE YOUR FATHER.

08:52.767 --> 08:54.833
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I DON'T KNOW.

08:54.833 --> 08:57.400
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S JUST THAT...

08:57.400 --> 09:00.133
HE WAS SO AWFUL DURING MY...

09:00.133 --> 09:02.467
LADIES' DAYS.

09:02.467 --> 09:05.033
ANYTIME I HAPPENED
TO MAKE A COMMENT

09:05.033 --> 09:06.667
ABOUT HIS USUAL
DISGUSTING BEHAVIOR,

09:06.667 --> 09:08.000
HE WOULD JUST
BLAME IT ON THAT.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.433
- THAT'S WHAT RAY DOES.
- THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL DO.

09:11.433 --> 09:12.500
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

09:12.500 --> 09:13.600
LOOK, I'M JUST
TRYING TO HELP.

09:13.600 --> 09:14.967
- YOU SHOULD BE QUIET.
- YES.

09:14.967 --> 09:16.133
YES. OH, NO.

09:16.133 --> 09:17.133
HE IS TRYING TO HELP.

09:17.133 --> 09:18.167
LOOK WHAT HE DID.

09:18.167 --> 09:21.300
LOOK WHAT HE BOUGHT ME.
MAGIC PILLS, HUH?

09:21.300 --> 09:22.800
MAYBE I SHOULD TRY SOME.

09:22.800 --> 09:25.267
[gulping]
MMM. OH, LOOK.

09:25.267 --> 09:27.100
RAY'S CLOTHES
JUST FLEW OFF THE BED

09:27.100 --> 09:28.133
AND INTO THE HAMPER.

09:28.133 --> 09:29.733
THESE REALLY WORK.

09:29.733 --> 09:32.800
- OH. LET ME HAVE ONE.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.133
OHH...FRANK'S TOENAILS

09:35.133 --> 09:38.400
JUST CRAWLED RIGHT
INTO THE GARBAGE CAN.

09:44.333 --> 09:49.333
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MOM?
IT'S ME. RAYMIE.

09:49.333 --> 09:51.400
- RAYMOND, YOU KNOW
THAT I ALWAYS LET YOU TWO

09:51.400 --> 09:53.533
FIGHT YOUR OWN BATTLES,
BUT I CAN'T LET YOU GO ON

09:53.533 --> 09:56.200
WITH THIS CYCLE OF
YOUR FATHER'S IMBECILITY.

09:56.200 --> 09:57.200
- I'M OUT OF HERE.

09:57.200 --> 09:58.300
- OH, COME ON.
WHERE YOU GOING?

09:58.300 --> 09:59.433
- I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE I'LL CALL AMY.

09:59.433 --> 10:00.767
MAYBE I'LL GO TO THE MALL,
DO SOME SHOPPING.

10:00.767 --> 10:03.200
- I'M LEAVING TOO.
I'M GONNA TALK TO YOUR FATHER.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.867
- OH, PLEASE, COME ON.
DEBRA, DEBRA, PLEASE.

10:04.867 --> 10:06.367
- RAYMOND, DON'T YOU
SAY ONE MORE WORD,

10:06.367 --> 10:07.633
OR I'M GONNA SEND
YOUR MOTHER RIGHT BACK IN HERE

10:07.633 --> 10:11.600
TO SMACK THE CRAP
OUT OF YOU.

10:20.200 --> 10:23.800
- THE THREE-GAME SERIES IS EVEN
AT ONE APIECE.

10:23.800 --> 10:24.867
- HI.

10:24.867 --> 10:27.067
- OH, YOU'RE HOME.

10:27.067 --> 10:28.367
DID YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME?

10:28.367 --> 10:29.200
- YEAH.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.400
- WHAT'D YOU DO?

10:30.400 --> 10:32.867
- I TOLD YOU.
I WENT SHOPPING WITH AMY.

10:32.867 --> 10:36.267
- SHOPPING? FOR 5 HOURS?

10:36.267 --> 10:39.900
WHERE ARE YOUR SHOPPING BAGS?

10:39.900 --> 10:41.100
- I DIDN'T BUY ANYTHING.

10:41.100 --> 10:41.933
WE JUST WALKED AROUND
FOR A WHILE,

10:41.933 --> 10:44.733
THEN WE WENT BACK TO AMY'S AND,
YOU KNOW, JUST SAT AROUND,

10:44.733 --> 10:46.233
TALKING, RELAXING.

10:46.233 --> 10:48.433
- OH, SITTING AROUND,
TALKING, RELAXING, YEAH.

10:48.433 --> 10:49.833
YOU WANT TO HEAR MY EVENING?

10:49.833 --> 10:52.800
I FED THE KIDS DINNER:
PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.933
THEN I GAVE 'EM A BATH,
'CAUSE THEY WERE COVERED

10:54.933 --> 10:57.000
IN PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.600
THEN I'M MEAN, BECAUSE I WON'T
LET THEM SLEEP IN A TREE HOUSE,

10:59.600 --> 11:01.833
AND THEN THEY WENT TO BED
YELLING AND SCREAMING.

11:01.833 --> 11:03.900
SO THAT WAS MY EVENING.

11:03.900 --> 11:05.767
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

11:05.767 --> 11:07.867
- WELL, THAT'S MY EVENING
EVERY NIGHT, SO--

11:07.867 --> 11:09.167
- OH, DON'T EVEN.

11:13.067 --> 11:16.100
YOU JUST WANTED ME
TO SUFFER TONIGHT.

11:16.100 --> 11:18.467
- WHAT?
- YES. IT'S NOT FAIR.

11:18.467 --> 11:20.133
YOU GET TO WALK OUT
AND DO WHATEVER YOU WANT,

11:20.133 --> 11:21.667
AND--AND--
LET'S JUST SAY IT--

11:21.667 --> 11:23.633
USE YOUR "LADIES' DAYS"
AS AN EXCUSE

11:23.633 --> 11:27.567
TO TREAT ME ROTTEN
EVERY MONTH.

11:31.067 --> 11:33.600
- MY NEEDING TO GET OUT OF HERE
ONCE IN A WHILE

11:33.600 --> 11:38.733
HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH MY "LADIES' DAYS."

11:40.767 --> 11:43.733
- BULL-LONEY.

11:48.900 --> 11:50.000
- WHAT?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.267
- BALONEY.

11:51.267 --> 11:53.267
YOU WANT TO SEE?
'CAUSE I DON'T CARE, OKAY?

11:53.267 --> 11:54.267
I DON'T CARE ANYMORE.

11:54.267 --> 11:56.133
I TRIED TO BE NICE,
AND THAT DOESN'T WORK.

11:56.133 --> 11:57.600
HERE. LOOK AT THIS.
YOU SEE THIS DATE?

11:57.600 --> 12:00.533
THAT'S TODAY.
NOW, THIS IS LAST MONTH.

12:00.533 --> 12:02.667
WHAT A COINCIDENCE
THAT ON THE SAME DAY LAST MONTH,

12:02.667 --> 12:05.533
I FOUND MY GOLF CLUBS
UPSIDE DOWN IN THE GARBAGE CAN.

12:05.533 --> 12:07.767
I'M TELLING YOU,
I'M SICK OF THIS, ALL RIGHT?

12:07.767 --> 12:09.600
EVERY MONTH THE--
THE SAME WACKO SCREAMING AT ME

12:09.600 --> 12:12.233
FOR NO REASON,
HAVING MELTDOWNS AND CRYING,

12:12.233 --> 12:13.467
CRYING OVER NOTHING.

12:13.467 --> 12:14.500
AND YOU WON'T EVEN ADMIT
WHAT IT IS.

12:14.500 --> 12:18.200
AND GOD FORBID I SHOULD MENTION
WHAT MIGHT BE THE PROBLEM.

12:18.200 --> 12:19.333
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

12:19.333 --> 12:20.700
I THINK THAT YOU
ENJOY YOUR LADIES' DAYS,

12:20.700 --> 12:22.700
BECAUSE YOU THINK I DESERVE
TO BE TREATED LIKE THIS.

12:22.700 --> 12:23.867
"OH, LOOK WHAT DAY IT IS.

12:23.867 --> 12:24.867
OH, COME HERE, RAY."

12:24.867 --> 12:28.300
POW. POW. POW. POW.

12:28.300 --> 12:31.300
"OH, OH, I'VE BEEN
SAVING THAT UP."

12:31.300 --> 12:33.300
AND THEN AFTER
A COUPLE DAYS OF THAT,

12:33.300 --> 12:34.500
YOU'RE LIKE, "OH, SORRY, RAY.

12:34.500 --> 12:38.467
I WAS JUST A LITTLE BIT,
HEH, YOU KNOW."

12:38.467 --> 12:40.333
AND BY THE WAY, THE NEXT TIME
I USED THOSE CLUBS,

12:40.333 --> 12:42.233
I SHOT A 110, SO DON'T THINK
I DON'T KNOW

12:42.233 --> 12:45.267
YOU DIDN'T PUT A CURSE ON THEM.

12:45.267 --> 12:47.867
- YOU ARE OUT OF YOUR MIND.

12:47.867 --> 12:52.400
- NO, YOU ARE...
ONCE A MONTH.

12:52.400 --> 12:53.500
IF WHAT I'M SAYING
ISN'T TRUE,

12:53.500 --> 12:56.067
HOW COME YOU DON'T TREAT ME
LIKE THIS ON ALL THE OTHER DAYS?

12:56.067 --> 12:57.233
- I TREAT YOU JUST FINE, RAY.

12:57.233 --> 12:58.567
YOU'RE JUST MAD,
'CAUSE YOU HAD TO SPEND

12:58.567 --> 12:59.967
ONE LOUSY NIGHT
WITH THE KIDS.

12:59.967 --> 13:01.700
- OH, SO YOU DON'T GET CRAZY
THIS TIME OF MONTH?

13:01.700 --> 13:03.367
- NO.
- YOU REMAIN PERFECTLY CALM,

13:03.367 --> 13:05.733
DON'T OVERREACT,
DON'T TREAT ME MEANLY,

13:05.733 --> 13:08.233
OR YELL AT ME
LIKE A SCREAMING, RAVING MANIAC.

13:08.233 --> 13:10.067
- NO, I DO NOT.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.333
- 4:38 TODAY...

13:17.600 --> 13:19.600
RIGHT WHEN
THE GUYS WENT HOME.

13:19.600 --> 13:23.133
- I'VE TOLD YOU 8 MILLION TIMES
WHEN YOU EMPTY THE DRYER,

13:23.133 --> 13:25.233
YOU CLEAN THE LINT SCREEN.

13:25.233 --> 13:26.367
LOOK AT ALL THIS LINT.

13:26.367 --> 13:27.533
WHAT, DO YOU LIKE LINT, RAY?

13:27.533 --> 13:28.867
MAYBE I'LL GET YOU SOME
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY.

13:28.867 --> 13:32.333
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, RAY.
HERE'S YOUR LINT.

13:41.400 --> 13:44.400
- I JUST THOUGHT YOU'D,
YOU KNOW,

13:44.400 --> 13:46.033
WANT TO HEAR
WHAT YOU SOUND LIKE

13:46.033 --> 13:49.800
WHEN YOU'RE LIKE THIS.

13:49.800 --> 13:52.367
OKAY?

13:54.100 --> 13:57.133
- YOU ARE A GIGANTIC ASS.

14:00.733 --> 14:03.667
- 10:32, "GIGANTIC ASS."

14:10.733 --> 14:15.433
LISTEN, I'M SORRY.

14:15.433 --> 14:20.167
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO HEAR YOURSELF ON TAPE.

14:20.167 --> 14:24.633
I REMEMBER WHEN I HEARD
MY FIRST RADIO INTERVIEW.

14:24.633 --> 14:28.367
FIRST OF ALL, I SOUNDED
LIKE SNUFFLEUPAGUS.

14:32.700 --> 14:35.200
I SAID, "DO I REALLY SOUND
LIKE THAT?" AND ANDY SAID--

14:35.200 --> 14:37.000
- OH, WOULD YOU STOP IT.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.600
I'M NOT CRYING
BECAUSE OF WHAT I SOUND LIKE.

14:40.600 --> 14:43.933
I'M CRYING BECAUSE I'M MARRIED
TO AN INSENSITIVE DURFWAD

14:43.933 --> 14:46.600
WHO INSTEAD OF TRYING TO MAKE
LIFE BETTER FOR HIS WIFE,

14:46.600 --> 14:50.067
TAPE-RECORDS HER SO HE HAS PROOF
THAT SHE'S A TERRIBLE PERSON.

14:50.067 --> 14:54.400
- WHAT'S A DURFWAD?

14:54.400 --> 14:56.100
- WHAT, WAS THAT TAPE
FOR THE GUYS, HUH?

14:56.100 --> 14:57.367
YOU GONNA PLAY IT
FOR THE GUYS?

14:57.367 --> 14:59.367
"HEY, COME ON, FELLAS,
STEP RIGHT UP

14:59.367 --> 15:01.967
AND LISTEN TO THE WITCH
WHO KILLED MY GOOD TIME."

15:01.967 --> 15:03.233
- NO. NO.
IT'S JUST FOR US.

15:03.233 --> 15:05.467
- YEAH. YEAH.

15:05.467 --> 15:06.933
WHERE'S MY TAPE RECORDER, RAY?

15:06.933 --> 15:07.967
WHERE WAS MY TAPE RECORDER

15:07.967 --> 15:10.300
WHEN I WAS IN LABOR
WITH THE TWINS FOR 36 HOURS,

15:10.300 --> 15:13.100
AND YOU WERE ASKING THE NURSE
IF THE TV GETS ESPN?

15:15.367 --> 15:17.933
- WELL, I MEAN, 36 HOURS,
THAT'S NOT A SHORT TIME.

15:17.933 --> 15:19.400
- YEAH. GUESS WHAT.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.200
IT'S EVEN LONGER
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO PUSH

15:21.200 --> 15:22.300
TWO HUMAN BEINGS
OUT OF YOUR BODY

15:22.300 --> 15:23.400
WHILE YOUR HUSBAND'S GOING,

15:23.400 --> 15:26.200
"DOES THIS HOSPITAL
HAVE FUDGESICLES?"

15:26.200 --> 15:28.233
YEAH, WHERE'S
MY TAPE RECORDER, HUH?

15:28.233 --> 15:29.567
OR WHEN YOU ASK ME
WHY I GET SO UPSET

15:29.567 --> 15:31.533
BECAUSE I FIND YOUR
UNDERPANTS IN THE KITCHEN, HUH?

15:31.533 --> 15:35.933
OR WHEN YOU STARTED SNORING
AT MY GRANDMOTHER'S FUNERAL?

15:35.933 --> 15:38.267
OR WHEN YOU TAPED
A FOOTBALL GAME

15:38.267 --> 15:42.667
OVER OUR WEDDING VIDEO?

15:42.667 --> 15:45.067
- DO YOU--DO YOU REALLY NEED
A TAPE RECORDER?

15:45.067 --> 15:46.400
YOU SEEM TO REMEMBER EVERYTHING.

15:46.400 --> 15:48.733
- YEAH.

15:48.733 --> 15:50.967
THAT'S RIGHT, RAY.
I REMEMBER EVERYTHING.

15:50.967 --> 15:52.433
AND I'M NOT GONNA FORGET,
EITHER.

15:52.433 --> 15:53.833
- HONEY, I THINK YOU MAKE
SOME EXCELLENT POINTS HERE,

15:53.833 --> 15:56.433
BUT I CAN'T HELP
WONDERING THAT, YOU KNOW,

15:56.433 --> 15:58.600
MAYBE PART OF THE REASON
YOU'RE SO UPSET RIGHT NOW

15:58.600 --> 16:00.267
MIGHT POSSIBLY
BE PMS-RELATED.

16:00.267 --> 16:02.667
- WOULD SOMEBODY GET ME
A TAPE RECORDER,

16:02.667 --> 16:03.900
BECAUSE I CANNOT BELIEVE
YOU JUST SAID THAT.

16:03.900 --> 16:06.033
- LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

16:06.033 --> 16:07.767
- YEAH. YEAH.
NO KIDDING.

16:07.767 --> 16:10.300
LISTEN, IF I HAD PMS--
AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT I HAVE--

16:10.300 --> 16:11.667
IS THAT HOW YOU HELP ME?

16:11.667 --> 16:14.033
BY TAPING ME,
BY TELLING ME I HAVE PMS?

16:14.033 --> 16:17.933
THAT DOESN'T HELP ME, RAY.
THAT DOESN'T HELP ME.

16:17.933 --> 16:19.367
- WELL, WHAT DO
YOU WANT ME TO DO?

16:19.367 --> 16:21.167
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

16:21.167 --> 16:23.233
SHOW ME WHAT TO DO.
JUST DRAW IT OUT FOR ME.

16:23.233 --> 16:25.533
- HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT
ABOUT GIVING ME A HUG?

16:25.533 --> 16:28.267
- A HUG.

16:28.267 --> 16:29.333
- YES, A HUG.

16:29.333 --> 16:31.400
DID YOU EVER THINK
OF HUGGING ME, YOU JERK?

16:31.400 --> 16:32.833
- WELL, IT'S PRETTY HARD
TO HUG SOMEONE

16:32.833 --> 16:34.600
WHO'S TRYING TO KILL YOU.

16:34.600 --> 16:35.667
- YEAH, WELL, IT NEVER
OCCURRED TO YOU.

16:35.667 --> 16:37.233
YOU'VE NEVER EVEN
TRIED IT BEFORE.

16:37.233 --> 16:39.700
- WELL, LOOK.
THIS IS NOT HUGGABLE.

16:39.700 --> 16:41.533
THIS--THIS IS NOT DEBRA.

16:41.533 --> 16:43.500
THIS IS THE WOMAN
WHO SHOWS UP ONCE A MONTH

16:43.500 --> 16:47.267
TO RIP INTO ME LIKE A MONKEY
ON A CUPCAKE.

16:47.267 --> 16:48.467
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

16:48.467 --> 16:49.800
THAT'S THE REASON
I TAPED YOU:

16:49.800 --> 16:50.800
SO YOU COULD HEAR YOURSELF

16:50.800 --> 16:53.533
AND MAYBE ADMIT
THAT THERE MIGHT BE A PROBLEM

16:53.533 --> 16:57.900
THAT ISN'T JUST ME
BEING A DORKWANG OR WHATEVER.

16:57.900 --> 17:01.600
[telephone rings]

17:01.600 --> 17:03.833
- HELLO?

17:03.833 --> 17:05.867
HI, AMY.

17:05.867 --> 17:08.233
YEAH. YEAH.

17:08.233 --> 17:11.833
YOU WENT BACK
FOR THAT DRESS?

17:11.833 --> 17:13.833
HOW MUCH WAS IT?

17:13.833 --> 17:17.200
OH. YOU ARE SO BAD.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.367
YEAH. RIGHT. RIGHT. RIGHT.

17:19.367 --> 17:22.100
OH, GOD. I KNOW.
ME TOO. ME TOO.

17:22.100 --> 17:24.767
OH, MY GOD.

17:24.767 --> 17:28.300
OKAY, WELL, LISTEN.
I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW, OKAY?

17:28.300 --> 17:33.400
OKAY. ALL RIGHT. BYE-BYE.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.033
- FEELING BETTER?

17:44.033 --> 17:45.900
- SHE'S SO FUNNY.

17:45.900 --> 17:47.633
- YEAH, SHE IS.

17:47.633 --> 17:51.533
COULD WE PUT HER NUMBER
ON SPEED DIAL?

17:54.167 --> 17:55.267
- LISTEN, RAY.

17:55.267 --> 18:00.033
OH. I'M SORRY.

18:00.033 --> 18:04.300
I GUESS I AM A LITTLE,
YOU KNOW.

18:04.300 --> 18:08.167
- WELL, I DIDN'T WANT
TO SAY ANYTHING.

18:14.800 --> 18:17.500
- LISTEN, I...

18:17.500 --> 18:20.367
I--I DON'T MEAN TO--
TO LAY INTO YOU LIKE THAT.

18:20.367 --> 18:22.633
- I KNOW. I KNOW. I KNOW.

18:22.633 --> 18:27.833
- COME ON. SIT.
- NO. IT'S OKAY.

18:27.833 --> 18:29.633
- RAY.

18:33.500 --> 18:34.600
HONEY, LISTEN.

18:34.600 --> 18:35.867
IT'S JUST THAT,
YOU KNOW,

18:35.867 --> 18:40.067
I NEED A LITTLE UNDERSTANDING,
JUST A LITTLE CARING.

18:40.067 --> 18:41.267
I NEED TO KNOW THAT,
YOU KNOW,

18:41.267 --> 18:43.133
IF I'M GOING THROUGH
A ROUGH TIME,

18:43.133 --> 18:45.367
THAT--THAT
YOU'RE THERE FOR ME,

18:45.367 --> 18:47.633
AND THAT YOU WANT TO,
YOU KNOW,

18:47.633 --> 18:50.500
JUST TAKE CARE OF ME.

18:50.500 --> 18:54.100
- I DO WANT TO.

18:54.100 --> 18:56.333
YOU'RE MY GIRL.

18:59.100 --> 19:01.000
- I LOVE YOU, RAY.

19:08.167 --> 19:09.200
- OH, GOD, YOU'RE A MESS.

19:09.200 --> 19:12.333
- I KNOW.

19:15.967 --> 19:18.600
- LISTEN, YOU WANT TO JUST TRY
THOSE PILLS THAT I GOT YOU?

19:18.600 --> 19:21.600
'CAUSE I REALLY JUST WANT YOU
TO FEEL BETTER.

19:21.600 --> 19:24.467
- YEAH, I KNOW, BUT I JUST
WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT,

19:24.467 --> 19:26.800
YOU KNOW, NO PILL
IS GONNA SOLVE EVERYTHING.

19:26.800 --> 19:27.633
- YEAH. I KNOW.
I KNOW THAT.

19:27.633 --> 19:29.633
- I MEAN, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT GOES ON IN HERE?

19:29.633 --> 19:31.200
- YEAH. LET ME JUST GET 'EM.
- I KNOW, BUT--

19:31.200 --> 19:32.900
YOU KNOW, YES,
THERE'S ALL THESE EMOTIONS--

19:32.900 --> 19:33.800
- I KNOW.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.133
BELIEVE ME. LISTEN.
I'M VERY INTO ALL OF THAT.

19:35.133 --> 19:36.333
LET ME GET THE PILLS.

20:13.833 --> 20:16.133
- HERE WE GO.
HMM?

20:16.133 --> 20:17.467
HERE WE GO.
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

20:17.467 --> 20:18.900
LOOK, IT'S, "FOR BLOATING--

20:18.900 --> 20:21.100
FOR BLOATING, CRAMPS,"
AND, OH, RIGHT THERE,

20:21.100 --> 20:22.933
"IRRITABILITY
ASSOCIATED WITH PMS."

20:22.933 --> 20:25.833
WE HAVE A WINNER.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.967
GOES GREAT
WITH GINGER ALE.

20:27.967 --> 20:29.567
OKAY, HERE WE GO.

20:32.133 --> 20:36.067
HERE WE GO.

20:36.067 --> 20:37.367
WHAT? HEY. COME ON.

20:37.367 --> 20:39.000
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST
LOCK ME IN THE ATTIC

20:39.000 --> 20:40.600
FOR A FEW DAYS?

20:51.800 --> 20:53.233
- WHAT?

20:53.233 --> 20:54.267
YOU'RE THE ONE...

20:54.267 --> 20:57.200
YOU, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO SAID, "HUG ME."

20:57.200 --> 21:00.767
THE HUG WAS YOUR IDEA.

21:02.867 --> 21:05.733
[sighs]

21:05.733 --> 21:07.733
COME ON, COMET.

21:19.467 --> 21:22.400
- SO YOU THINK I'M JUST RUDE
AND INSENSITIVE,

21:22.400 --> 21:23.533
THAT I'M SO TOUGH
TO LIVE WITH,

21:23.533 --> 21:27.133
AND YOU'RE THE QUEEN OF SHEBA?

21:27.133 --> 21:29.200
DID YOU EVER
HEAR YOURSELF?

21:29.200 --> 21:30.733
WELL, IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T,

21:30.733 --> 21:34.133
HERE'S A LITTLE TRICK
THAT MY BOY RAYMOND TAUGHT ME.

21:34.133 --> 21:38.467
I SAID, "WHERE'S MY EGGS?"

21:38.467 --> 21:39.867
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

21:39.867 --> 21:41.767
HERE, HERE. WAIT A MINUTE.
HERE, HERE IT IS.

21:41.767 --> 21:45.133
WHAT?. IT'S JUST MY FEET.
THEY'RE NOT DIRTY.

21:45.133 --> 21:46.800
AW, CRAP.

21:46.800 --> 21:47.667
HEY, WHERE YOU GOING?

21:47.667 --> 21:50.467
YOU SCARED YOU'RE GONNA HEAR
SOMETHING YOU DON'T LIKE?

21:50.467 --> 21:53.433
IF I SCRATCH IT,
IT'S BECAUSE IT ITCHES.
