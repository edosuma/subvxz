00:00.078 --> 00:01.971
Previously on Switched at Birth...

00:01.979 --> 00:04.325
- I didn't win this. It's like a forfait.
- Come on!

00:04.340 --> 00:06.014
Let's go out and celebrate with your staff.

00:06.053 --> 00:07.422
You should have stood up for me

00:07.437 --> 00:09.260
when everybody was arguing

00:09.275 --> 00:12.067
about whether the hearing kids should stay.

00:12.106 --> 00:13.740
You are making this personal!

00:13.764 --> 00:15.782
- Where's Lana?
- She took the baby and left.

00:15.828 --> 00:17.698
The nurse just told me
she had a plane to catch.

00:17.729 --> 00:20.412
So, Ty, no college, no job,

00:20.428 --> 00:22.711
- any plans at all?
- Well, I've enlisted in the army.

00:22.831 --> 00:23.916
I was gonna tell you.

00:23.908 --> 00:25.660
On a postcard from Afghanistan?!

00:25.780 --> 00:26.997
We're engaged.

00:27.279 --> 00:28.171
To be married.

00:28.225 --> 00:30.532
- Have you been drinking?
- Maybe a little.

00:30.652 --> 00:33.872
Angelo has arranged for you
to go to a clinic in Minnesota.

00:34.702 --> 00:37.303
- Rehab?
- Yes.

00:43.661 --> 00:46.112
Do you want to share a strawberry smoothie?

00:46.147 --> 00:48.515
- Oh, I thought we'd each get our own.
- Done.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.016
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:50.051 --> 00:51.418
Two strawberry smoothies, please.

00:51.452 --> 00:55.288
- And some French fries.
- French fries and a smoothie!

00:55.322 --> 00:57.957
- I like your style, lady.
- Kathryn!

00:57.991 --> 00:59.125
Oh, I'll be right back.

00:59.159 --> 01:01.161
I'll put it on your tab.
What's your last name?

01:01.195 --> 01:02.929
- Kennish.
- Okay.

01:04.864 --> 01:07.901
Remember the days when she
was all about East Riverside?

01:07.935 --> 01:10.537
That is seriously like her third smoothie.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.772
Is this really all over a guy?

01:12.807 --> 01:14.708
One that you didn't even
really like that much?

01:14.742 --> 01:16.776
Who says that I didn't like Noah?

01:16.811 --> 01:18.578
You guys dated for like two weeks.

01:18.612 --> 01:21.381
Untrue. It was three and a half.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.249
And it's not just about a guy.

01:23.284 --> 01:26.186
- When does Regina get back?
- Sunday.

01:26.220 --> 01:28.988
Then Daphne can move
back into the guesthouse

01:29.023 --> 01:31.257
and you can go back to glaring
at her from across the driveway.

01:31.292 --> 01:33.093
Can't wait.

01:35.262 --> 01:36.996
Look, wedding talk.

01:38.966 --> 01:41.101
"It's true, he is engaged!

01:41.135 --> 01:44.604
- We're thrilled."
- "Oh yes, they are registered.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.573
Oh, not at baby world."

01:46.607 --> 01:48.641
"Oh, your son's going to Emory in the fall?

01:48.676 --> 01:50.844
Ours is living at home,
playing guitar in the garage,

01:50.878 --> 01:52.812
waiting for his fiancÃ©e
to come back from Peru...

01:52.847 --> 01:54.514
- We couldn't be prouder."
- Hey!

01:58.385 --> 02:01.287
Do you think they'll ever actually
get behind this wedding thing?

02:01.322 --> 02:03.389
I don't know.

02:03.424 --> 02:05.959
Hi guys!

02:05.993 --> 02:08.044
- Hey.
- Hi. I need a dip.

02:08.078 --> 02:09.846
Take my seat.

02:09.880 --> 02:10.964
- Hello.
- Hey.

02:16.754 --> 02:18.037
Bay!

02:18.072 --> 02:20.106
How are we doing on the summer job hunt?

02:20.141 --> 02:22.959
Good good! Lots of leads.

02:23.010 --> 02:26.613
No no no, we said that unless
you have actual employment

02:26.647 --> 02:29.649
by the time my office opened,
that you would be working for me.

02:29.683 --> 02:32.452
Come on, dad. You already
have Daphne interning for you.

02:32.486 --> 02:33.720
Plenty of room for both of you.

02:33.754 --> 02:36.556
Toby works at the car wash.
Can't one of us have employment

02:36.590 --> 02:38.625
at a non-John-Kennish-affiliated site?

02:38.659 --> 02:41.427
You haven't found a job
yet and we had a deal.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.263
Dad, please don't do this to me.

02:43.297 --> 02:45.365
It's done. It's happening.

02:45.399 --> 02:47.383
I'm excited!

02:52.339 --> 02:55.041
You're underestimating how
hard this transition is.

02:55.075 --> 02:57.811
You won't have the same level
of support that you have here.

02:57.845 --> 03:00.747
You might be walking into a situation
where people are still angry at you.

03:00.781 --> 03:03.716
Then I'm going to have to be a
big girl and face that, won't I?

03:03.751 --> 03:05.552
Your program doesn't end until Sunday.

03:05.586 --> 03:08.521
Every single day here is important, Regina.

03:08.556 --> 03:10.423
Every one.

03:10.457 --> 03:12.392
I strongly advise against leaving early.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.394
Daphne and I always go to the pool

03:14.428 --> 03:16.462
in our old neighborhood
the first day it opens.

03:16.497 --> 03:19.232
We get popsicles. It's our thing.

03:19.266 --> 03:22.135
- So you'll do it next week.
- No.

03:22.169 --> 03:25.071
I've missed enough time with the
girls already. I need to get home.

03:25.105 --> 03:26.389
You can't get complacent about this.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.141
You really need to put yourself...

03:28.175 --> 03:30.910
In an environment that is
conducive to staying sober.

03:30.945 --> 03:33.046
I know that.

03:33.080 --> 03:35.048
But I feel strong.

03:35.082 --> 03:37.016
I really do.

03:37.051 --> 03:39.986
Okay, everyone, put your
wet things in this bag.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.555
Girls, can you unload the cooler?

03:42.589 --> 03:44.557
And what does everybody want for dinner?

03:44.575 --> 03:46.626
I'm going to Nikki's for dinner.

03:46.660 --> 03:49.429
She can't have one meal without you?

03:49.463 --> 03:52.332
Mom, I am getting married.

03:52.366 --> 03:54.400
There's nothing that's
going to change that.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.236
So either you get on board with that

03:56.270 --> 03:58.304
or you and I are going
to be fighting all summer.

04:01.208 --> 04:03.209
He's right, you know.
We've got to start acting

04:03.244 --> 04:05.311
- like we're happy about this thing.
- Meaning what?

04:05.346 --> 04:07.981
We're responsible for the
rehearsal dinner, right?

04:08.015 --> 04:09.282
Maybe we should start planning one.

04:09.316 --> 04:11.751
You have no
reason to ignore me, Bay.

04:11.785 --> 04:14.087
Noah's gone for the summer
and we're barely even texting.

04:14.121 --> 04:16.589
Hey!

04:16.624 --> 04:18.992
Do you want to make some
more almond brittle tonight?

04:19.026 --> 04:21.894
- Definitely!
- How about you, Bay? You want to join us?

04:21.911 --> 04:23.546
No thanks, mom.

04:27.635 --> 04:29.702
I know I shouldn't be saying this,

04:29.737 --> 04:32.572
but it's been so nice

04:32.606 --> 04:36.309
having the two of them to
ourselves the past six weeks.

04:43.050 --> 04:46.250
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

04:50.078 --> 04:51.412
- Morning, Senator.
- Good morning, Mark.

04:51.430 --> 04:53.097
I've got three bills to brief you on

04:53.132 --> 04:55.049
and you have an 11:00
A.M. training session.

04:55.083 --> 04:56.985
Okay. Daphne is here to help

04:57.019 --> 04:59.254
and Bay is coming soon, so good luck.

04:59.288 --> 05:01.122
I've got a bunch of
emails for you to go over.

05:01.156 --> 05:03.224
We've got a few angry gun
lobbyists, some medicaid complaints,

05:03.259 --> 05:06.260
so you can grab that computer over by
the window. The login is your social.

05:06.278 --> 05:08.037
You're gonna have to slow down

05:08.038 --> 05:09.212
when you're talking to me,

05:09.331 --> 05:12.100
but I'm pretty sure you said to
get answering emails like now.

05:12.134 --> 05:13.434
- Yes, thank you.
- Okay.

05:13.469 --> 05:15.987
- Oh, and Senator?
- Yeah?

05:16.038 --> 05:17.438
You have got a fracking bill to go over.

05:17.456 --> 05:20.325
- Wow.

05:22.211 --> 05:23.344
Senator Kennish's office.

05:25.080 --> 05:27.215
Yeah, I just gave it
to him. 3:00 P.M. today?

05:27.249 --> 05:28.449
I will let him know.

05:28.484 --> 05:30.184
- The whole thing?
- Yeah.

05:30.219 --> 05:32.020
- By 3:00 P.M.?
- Yeah.

05:32.054 --> 05:36.057
And chip coto needs a list of our 50
biggest donors for a reception on Saturday.

05:36.091 --> 05:39.193
- Give that to the girls.

05:39.228 --> 05:42.096
I'm here, I'm here.

05:42.131 --> 05:44.265
Is that your mother's jacket?

05:44.300 --> 05:46.000
God yes.

05:46.035 --> 05:47.435
I'm wearing pantyhose.

05:47.469 --> 05:51.172
Huh. Mark's going to give you
a list of my 300 top donors.

05:51.240 --> 05:54.275
- You and Daphne need to narrow that down to 50.
- Fantastic.

06:00.115 --> 06:03.117
Okay, so we'll split the names,

06:03.152 --> 06:05.086
150 for each of us.

06:05.120 --> 06:07.188
And then I'll create a spreadsheet

06:07.222 --> 06:10.291
with how much they've
given to John in the past,

06:10.326 --> 06:12.961
how much they... what?

06:12.995 --> 06:15.296
You're not going to
boss me around here too.

06:15.331 --> 06:17.432
Do you have a better idea of how to do it?

06:17.466 --> 06:19.434
Yeah, I do.

06:19.468 --> 06:21.302
Great. You do it.

Hi. You scared me.

07:56.298 --> 07:59.300
Sorry. I didn't...

08:04.306 --> 08:05.957
I thought you were coming back on Sunday.

08:05.991 --> 08:08.292
I was. I checked out early.

08:08.327 --> 08:10.344
- Is everything okay?
- Oh, yeah yeah, fine.

08:10.379 --> 08:14.015
Um, how are you? Where is everybody?

08:14.049 --> 08:17.018
And what is this about?

08:17.052 --> 08:19.153
I'm working in my dad's office.

08:19.188 --> 08:21.055
- Oh.
- I know.

08:21.090 --> 08:23.007
I saw, that was so disgusting!

08:24.309 --> 08:26.127
- Mom!
- Regina.

08:28.163 --> 08:30.164
Can I get a hug?

08:30.199 --> 08:32.232
Of course.

08:32.267 --> 08:33.234
Hey!

08:36.989 --> 08:39.373
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

08:39.408 --> 08:42.176
- We thought you were coming home...
- I was.

08:42.211 --> 08:44.212
I just...

08:44.246 --> 08:46.347
Daphne and I had this tradition

08:46.381 --> 08:49.083
where the first day of summer we...

08:51.286 --> 08:54.021
Um...

08:54.056 --> 08:56.090
they sprung me early so here I am.

09:00.929 --> 09:02.697
We were just at the club.

09:02.731 --> 09:04.699
Um, Bay didn't want to go.

09:04.733 --> 09:06.734
But I brought you a smoothie, honey!

09:06.768 --> 09:08.803
Thank you.

09:08.837 --> 09:12.723
Yeah, I've been taking some lessons.

09:12.758 --> 09:14.542
It's really fun. You should too!

09:14.576 --> 09:16.477
Oh yeah! We should put you on the account.

09:16.512 --> 09:18.613
- Oh no no no.
- We were going to do it anyway.

09:18.647 --> 09:20.300
- I really don't think it's...
- You're gonna love it.

09:20.301 --> 09:22.136
The chef is amazing...

09:22.140 --> 09:24.485
- And the...
- Mom, she doesn't want to.

09:25.554 --> 09:29.223
Well, I'm going to go upstairs and unpack.

09:29.258 --> 09:32.326
- And settle in.
- Oh, I'll help you!

09:34.229 --> 09:35.196
Thanks.

09:36.231 --> 09:38.065
Goodbye, honey.

09:42.704 --> 09:44.639
I'm gonna go start dinner.

09:44.673 --> 09:46.674
If you want to help, come in, okay?

09:53.908 --> 09:56.530
Is grandma on another baby nurse job?

09:56.548 --> 09:58.469
Yeah, this one's for twins.

09:58.482 --> 10:00.183
We're not going to see her for weeks.

10:00.183 --> 10:02.892
I'm happy for her though. She's loving it.

10:03.012 --> 10:04.508
I know, but

10:04.543 --> 10:07.211
I hate that you've been all by yourself.

10:07.245 --> 10:10.114
And why is the fridge so empty?
What have you been eating?

10:10.148 --> 10:13.117
I've just been... eating over there mostly.

10:13.151 --> 10:15.886
Breakfast too?

10:15.921 --> 10:19.156
I was up late watching TV a bunch of nights

10:19.190 --> 10:21.825
so I just crashed in their guest room.

10:21.860 --> 10:24.662
Every night? What, are
you like living there now?

10:28.033 --> 10:29.733
Oh.

10:31.469 --> 10:35.739
- Grandma was gone...
- No, um, good, I'm glad.

10:39.477 --> 10:41.545
Hey, do you want to go
get a scrub tomorrow?

10:41.580 --> 10:43.347
We could go to that Korean spa

10:43.381 --> 10:45.482
- and just sit all day and...
- I'd love to,

10:45.517 --> 10:49.420
but John invited me to this
reception for Alex Smith.

10:49.454 --> 10:53.190
- Who?
- The new quarterback for the Chiefs.

10:53.224 --> 10:55.893
John pulled a lot of
strings to get tickets.

10:55.927 --> 10:58.662
Oh, well then, you should definitely go.

10:58.697 --> 11:00.030
But how about after?

11:00.065 --> 11:03.767
I made plans with my sponsor,
which I should probably keep.

11:03.802 --> 11:04.918
Of course.

11:07.639 --> 11:10.574
How about I make you
a welcome-home dinner?

11:10.609 --> 11:13.444
Oh, I would... I would love that!

11:13.478 --> 11:16.280
Kathryn and I do these amazing kebabs.

11:16.314 --> 11:17.681
Oh, for everybody?

11:17.716 --> 11:21.385
Well, I'm sure that Bay would want to come.

11:21.419 --> 11:24.054
Of course. Good idea.

11:31.296 --> 11:33.981
That girl is back.

11:33.982 --> 11:34.919
__

11:35.166 --> 11:37.001
With the convertible.

11:41.750 --> 11:44.041
__

11:47.712 --> 11:49.763
I think you're right.

11:49.798 --> 11:51.381
__

11:51.382 --> 11:52.382
Yeah.

11:52.684 --> 11:55.252
Go ask her out.

11:55.286 --> 11:57.154
Do you know what they're saying?

11:57.188 --> 11:59.323
I wish. I've only had one semester.

11:59.357 --> 12:01.291
Have you guys had a conversation?

12:01.326 --> 12:03.427
Just told him that I'm taking
this sign language class

12:03.495 --> 12:05.362
and asked for the early-bird special.

12:05.397 --> 12:07.264
So come on, let's go talk to them.

12:09.300 --> 12:11.168
One's coming... what do I say?

12:11.202 --> 12:13.103
Why are you whispering? He can't hear you.

12:13.138 --> 12:15.222
- I know.
- Hey, hot deaf guy!

12:15.273 --> 12:16.974
- Stop it!
- Come hang out with us.

12:17.008 --> 12:20.044
Oh, hey.

12:20.078 --> 12:21.812
Um, I'm actually not deaf.

12:21.846 --> 12:23.881
Or single, but he is.

12:27.686 --> 12:29.520
Hey, guys.

12:29.554 --> 12:31.588
Travis, this is...

12:31.606 --> 12:33.440
Hi. Colette.

12:33.491 --> 12:34.491
Evelyn.

12:36.361 --> 12:39.196
Uh, nice to meet you.

12:39.197 --> 12:40.340
__

12:41.583 --> 12:44.268
Uh, I gotta get back to work.

12:54.012 --> 12:57.047
- You're up!
- Of course, I got up at 6:30 in rehab.

12:57.082 --> 12:59.783
Yoga and affirmations before breakfast.

12:59.818 --> 13:01.752
And I made you lunch.

13:01.786 --> 13:03.520
Thank you, but we've actually been

13:03.555 --> 13:05.622
going out for lunch mostly.

13:05.657 --> 13:07.624
Doesn't that get expensive?

13:07.659 --> 13:09.560
John and Kathryn got me a credit card.

13:09.594 --> 13:11.528
They what?

13:11.563 --> 13:13.397
It's not like I'm buying

13:13.431 --> 13:15.365
flat-screen TVs or anything with it.

13:15.400 --> 13:17.601
It's just for lunch and school supplies.

13:17.635 --> 13:19.536
I didn't have a credit card until I was 25.

13:19.571 --> 13:23.240
- It's really not a big deal.
- Hand it over.

13:26.010 --> 13:28.078
Hand it over.

13:36.721 --> 13:38.622
Thank you.

13:41.626 --> 13:43.861
- I have to go.
- Hey.

13:46.531 --> 13:48.532
Have a good day.

13:48.566 --> 13:50.267
You too.

14:00.094 --> 14:01.445
Oh.

14:12.223 --> 14:13.957
Come in!

14:15.860 --> 14:17.995
Oh hey, I'm just working
on this family tree thing.

14:18.029 --> 14:19.830
- Do you need...
- I, uh...

14:21.566 --> 14:23.684
I came to return this.

14:24.903 --> 14:26.770
Oh.

14:26.805 --> 14:28.806
I came in one night and...

14:28.840 --> 14:30.541
took it.

14:32.377 --> 14:34.645
- That's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

14:36.214 --> 14:38.081
I'm incredibly embarrassed

14:38.116 --> 14:39.983
and I want to apologize

14:40.018 --> 14:41.952
for that and...

14:41.986 --> 14:44.788
all of my behavior the weeks before I left.

14:44.823 --> 14:47.858
Thank you. I'm sure that it can't be easy.

14:47.892 --> 14:50.894
And I know that you took care
of Daphne while I was gone,

14:50.929 --> 14:53.030
and I really appreciate that...

14:53.064 --> 14:58.635
- It was nothing.
- ... But I am not okay

14:58.670 --> 15:01.638
with her having a credit card, so.

15:03.675 --> 15:07.000
It's not like she's buying
flat-screen TVs or anything.

15:07.001 --> 15:09.313
- I mean...

15:09.347 --> 15:11.381
It doesn't matter.

15:11.416 --> 15:14.384
You're denying her the joy of
buying things with her money.

15:14.419 --> 15:17.988
And you know what? Struggling
a little isn't so terrible.

15:18.022 --> 15:21.191
- It builds character.
- There are a lot of ways to build character...

15:23.228 --> 15:25.062
I don't consider it suffering

15:25.096 --> 15:27.698
for a high school junior not
to have her own credit card.

15:28.766 --> 15:30.701
Did you ask Daphne what she wants?

15:30.735 --> 15:32.970
She doesn't get to decide
what's best for her,

15:33.004 --> 15:34.571
I do.

15:35.607 --> 15:39.576
Well, you've made your
opinion crystal clear.

15:47.451 --> 15:49.269
- What can I get you?
- Is that a unicycle?

15:49.304 --> 15:51.388
Yes, and don't
ask me where the other wheel is.

15:51.386 --> 15:53.154
- Do you really...
- Yes, I really ride it.

15:53.188 --> 15:54.956
- But...
- Because it's easy to transport,

15:54.990 --> 15:56.858
it's easy to store, it's low maintenance

15:56.892 --> 15:58.259
and you can't really hurt yourself on it.

15:58.293 --> 16:01.762
And it's weird. And I like weird things.

16:01.797 --> 16:04.899
Okay. I got a lot of coffee orders for you:

16:04.933 --> 16:08.536
so one half caff latte with soy,

16:08.570 --> 16:11.706
no foam; two regular milk decaf;

16:11.740 --> 16:13.808
three skim... should
you be writing this down?

16:13.842 --> 16:15.610
One half caff with soy, no foam,

16:15.644 --> 16:17.478
two regular milk decaf, three skim.

16:17.512 --> 16:20.314
And these are presumably for the
new senators' training session,

16:20.349 --> 16:22.149
who are probably all
freaking out right about now.

16:22.184 --> 16:25.553
Wow, like a coffee-guy "Rain Man" thing.

16:25.587 --> 16:28.022
I'm not autistic, just a good listener.

16:28.056 --> 16:29.290
Oh.

16:31.193 --> 16:33.027
Why did the mail room just tell me

16:33.061 --> 16:35.796
that we don't have enough postage credit

16:35.831 --> 16:37.865
for 300 invitations?

16:37.900 --> 16:40.001
We were supposed to narrow it down to 50.

16:40.035 --> 16:42.770
But if we invite everyone,

16:42.804 --> 16:44.872
then I figure only 50 will show up.

16:44.907 --> 16:46.874
That's genius. Thank you.

16:47.943 --> 16:51.512
But what happens if 150 show up?

16:51.546 --> 16:53.514
Or 100 or even 75,

16:53.548 --> 16:56.450
and we only have enough food for 50?

16:56.485 --> 16:58.252
They're not gonna starve.

16:58.287 --> 17:00.221
I'll fix it myself.

17:00.255 --> 17:00.715
I'll wait for the coffee.

17:00.716 --> 17:03.078
I need you to go get the
muffins for the meeting.

17:03.092 --> 17:05.192
And don't forget the gluten-free.

17:05.227 --> 17:08.061
- Gluten-free?
- We're hosting a meeting.

17:08.096 --> 17:09.848
Senator Shershow asked for gluten-free

17:09.848 --> 17:11.664
and she's going to get gluten-free

17:12.034 --> 17:15.169
- if I have to go home and bake them myself.
- I'm going, I'm going.

17:18.123 --> 17:21.858
- That was so cool.
- What are you talking about?

17:21.893 --> 17:24.578
- I just found my next thing.
- Excuse me?

17:24.613 --> 17:26.681
I pick a new thing to learn every month

17:26.714 --> 17:29.684
and I just found my new thing... signing.

17:29.718 --> 17:32.753
Oh, you can't learn to sign in a month.

17:32.788 --> 17:33.754
Watch me.

17:35.390 --> 17:37.358
Hey, why don't you get back to fixing

17:37.392 --> 17:39.360
whatever you have to fix
and I'll bring these to you.

17:39.394 --> 17:42.263
Thank you.

17:47.269 --> 17:48.886
Oh.

17:48.937 --> 17:50.204
Oh, I... I... I don't know.

17:50.238 --> 17:52.272
A light went on and then another light

17:52.290 --> 17:54.875
and it started lurching and I pulled over.

17:54.893 --> 17:56.944
Look, it's a 40-year-old car

17:56.979 --> 17:59.647
and it's possible that
this is just the end.

17:59.681 --> 18:02.616
Then again, it's also possible
that it knows me so well

18:02.651 --> 18:04.735
and it conked out just
when I needed a break.

18:06.021 --> 18:07.922
45 minutes?

18:07.956 --> 18:10.724
No no, go do a couple of jobs before me.

18:10.742 --> 18:12.526
I'm sure there's a lot of folks out there

18:12.561 --> 18:14.662
who need to be on the road before I do.

18:16.398 --> 18:17.631
Where am I? Uh...

18:17.666 --> 18:21.185
where am I...

18:24.373 --> 18:26.340
apparently I'm in Maui.

18:58.191 --> 18:59.307
Those kids may look happy

18:59.342 --> 19:01.042
because they love the bumper cars,

19:01.076 --> 19:02.844
but it's really from the laughing gas

19:02.862 --> 19:04.813
we're pumping in through the tiki torches.

19:04.847 --> 19:06.748
That woman is pushing a stroller

19:06.782 --> 19:09.734
but there's really a
baby kangaroo inside...

19:09.769 --> 19:11.887
An alien baby kangaroo.

19:11.921 --> 19:14.823
Ooh, now there's a shark-shooter

19:14.857 --> 19:18.493
if I ever saw one. Come, save the surfers

19:18.511 --> 19:20.662
from the jaws of death.
Keep the deep blue sea

19:20.696 --> 19:23.765
- from turning red!
- I'm... I'm good, thanks.

19:23.799 --> 19:25.734
Aw, come on. Grab a rifle,

19:25.768 --> 19:28.286
look down the barrel and say

19:28.337 --> 19:30.305
"smile, you son of a fish!"

19:35.444 --> 19:37.145
Three tickets, please.

19:41.450 --> 19:43.018
Surf's up!

19:48.124 --> 19:49.975
Oh phooey.

19:51.727 --> 19:53.995
I knew I would suck at this.

19:58.701 --> 20:00.468
To the right... now.

20:00.502 --> 20:01.736
Lower.

20:01.771 --> 20:03.538
Now.

20:03.573 --> 20:05.340
Over to the left. Now.

20:05.374 --> 20:06.708
Back to the right, now.

20:07.710 --> 20:09.277
Higher, now.

20:13.349 --> 20:14.449
Hi.

20:16.352 --> 20:18.353
Oh my God, you're back!

20:19.355 --> 20:21.039
Hi.

20:21.073 --> 20:22.123
Uh...

20:23.959 --> 20:24.993
what are you doing here?!

20:25.027 --> 20:27.162
Uh, my tour was over,

20:27.196 --> 20:29.831
so I'm on the base now,
just finishing my enlistment.

20:29.849 --> 20:31.166
That's great! I mean,

20:31.200 --> 20:33.168
I'm just so happy that you're okay.

20:33.202 --> 20:35.770
How long have you been home?

20:35.805 --> 20:37.706
A couple of months.

20:39.508 --> 20:42.510
- Daphne didn't say anything.
- No, I didn't really call

20:42.545 --> 20:43.778
too many people.

20:43.813 --> 20:46.414
I'm still...

20:46.449 --> 20:47.749
just settling in and stuff, you know.

20:47.783 --> 20:50.585
- Well, you're here.
- Yep.

20:50.620 --> 20:53.288
And we're here and... and
we got a super high score!

20:53.322 --> 20:56.424
So what did we win?

20:56.459 --> 21:00.028
Well, you racked up a lot
of carcharodon carcasses.

21:00.062 --> 21:01.463
So any prize in the booth.

21:01.497 --> 21:04.132
Hmmm. What do we want?

21:04.166 --> 21:06.234
Well,

21:06.268 --> 21:08.203
you know, my room could really use

21:08.237 --> 21:10.872
a gigantic monkey hugging a banana.

21:10.906 --> 21:14.109
One gigantic monkey
hugging a banana, please!

21:14.143 --> 21:15.794
Okay...

21:17.746 --> 21:19.047
- How are you at skeeball?
- Horrible.

21:19.081 --> 21:20.848
- Let's do it.
- All right.

21:20.866 --> 21:22.701
I was reading about this trend

21:22.752 --> 21:24.936
where you hang crystals
from manzanita branches.

21:24.970 --> 21:27.656
- That sounds cool.
- And we could put tea lights

21:27.690 --> 21:30.491
on teak trays and float them on the pool.

21:30.509 --> 21:32.360
Or they have these lighting fixtures

21:32.395 --> 21:35.447
that could project
"congratulations Nikki and Toby"

21:35.481 --> 21:38.199
- right on the surface.
- Or "Toby and Nikki."

21:38.217 --> 21:41.135
All this for a rehearsal dinner?

21:41.153 --> 21:42.487
Come on, you're a musician,

21:42.521 --> 21:44.539
how could you not want to
see your name in lights?

21:44.573 --> 21:46.240
- Yay.
- Ha ha.

21:46.258 --> 21:48.259
Oh, this is where
we'll put the fondue bar.

21:56.235 --> 21:58.853
This place is awesome.

21:58.888 --> 22:01.990
Yeah, I've got a friend who works here so

22:02.024 --> 22:05.126
I come by whenever I want to be around
people that I don't have to salute.

22:07.797 --> 22:09.998
That's probably AAA. I have to get back

22:10.032 --> 22:13.702
to cleaning cinders and taking
orders from my wicked stepsister.

22:14.804 --> 22:15.870
Daphne?

22:15.905 --> 22:18.423
Yeah. You have no idea.

22:18.457 --> 22:20.508
Hello?

22:20.543 --> 22:22.510
Okay, yeah.

22:22.545 --> 22:24.479
I'll be there in a few seconds.

22:27.383 --> 22:30.201
I wish I could stay here... at the ball...

22:30.252 --> 22:32.220
all summer.

22:32.254 --> 22:35.256
Uh, you know, that guy
Mac at the shark booth,

22:35.291 --> 22:37.092
he's the manager here.

22:37.126 --> 22:39.344
- They might be looking.
- That guy's the manager?

22:39.395 --> 22:42.297
Yeah, I've gotten to know him a
little bit from hanging out here.

22:42.331 --> 22:45.166
So if your car gets fixed
we can go talk to him.

22:51.073 --> 22:54.609
Hi! You will never guess
what happened today!

22:54.643 --> 22:57.879
Oh, let me try. You went out to get
pastries for an important meeting

22:57.913 --> 23:01.449
- and never returned?
- My car broke down. I texted.

23:01.484 --> 23:03.418
Bay, look, I know you
weren't thrilled about it,

23:03.452 --> 23:06.254
but you had a commitment
to this job, to me,

23:06.288 --> 23:08.323
and by the way, to your
sister, who had to then go out

23:08.357 --> 23:10.325
and get the pastries once you disappeared.

23:10.359 --> 23:12.160
First of all, she's not my sister.

23:12.194 --> 23:14.395
Second of all, you can go ahead and
fire me because I found another job.

23:14.430 --> 23:17.132
- Doing what?
- Working at that amusement park,

23:17.166 --> 23:20.335
- Maui, Kansas.
- No, that's not gonna happen.

23:20.369 --> 23:23.171
- Why not?
- It's in a terrible neighborhood.

23:23.205 --> 23:25.774
No, it's just not surrounded by mansions.

23:25.808 --> 23:27.909
That place is less than a
mile from where I grew up.

23:27.943 --> 23:30.612
I used to take Daphne all the time.

23:30.646 --> 23:33.832
Okay. So you'd actually
rather have "carnival"

23:33.883 --> 23:35.817
on your resume than an internship

23:35.851 --> 23:37.552
in a state Senator's office?

23:37.586 --> 23:39.354
What's wrong with working at a carnival?

23:39.388 --> 23:41.389
That's the type of job
most high school kids get.

23:41.423 --> 23:42.690
Plus she got this one herself.

23:42.725 --> 23:44.692
I doubt an internship
at her father's office

23:44.727 --> 23:47.295
is going to fool anyone
in the admissions office.

23:47.329 --> 23:49.531
So tell me what she's going
to learn at a carnival.

23:49.565 --> 23:52.367
How to make cotton
candy and clean up vomit?

23:52.401 --> 23:56.070
- Sure. Why not?
- Actually I'm on games.

23:56.105 --> 23:59.274
Come on, she's got the rest of her
life to be cooped up inside some office.

23:59.308 --> 24:01.276
Dinner! Come on,

24:01.310 --> 24:03.111
let's everyone head out.

24:03.145 --> 24:06.080
- Thank you, Regina.
- You're welcome.

24:06.115 --> 24:08.800
Come on, it's time to eat.

24:08.851 --> 24:10.735
Thanks.

24:12.865 --> 24:14.585
So, what's the story on Angelo?

24:15.678 --> 24:17.980
Well, I spoke to him yesterday.

24:18.014 --> 24:20.682
He and the private investigator...

24:20.717 --> 24:22.618
or attorney or whoever...

24:22.652 --> 24:24.853
they think they've tracked down the family

24:24.921 --> 24:27.522
that Lana wanted to give the baby to,

24:27.557 --> 24:32.561
so they're on their way to
see if this couple has her.

24:32.595 --> 24:34.363
And if they do?

24:34.397 --> 24:36.565
I guess they start some
kind of custody battle.

24:36.599 --> 24:39.334
That's gonna take forever.

24:39.369 --> 24:41.236
So how was everyone's day?

24:41.271 --> 24:44.106
Well, mine was... ahem...

24:44.140 --> 24:46.875
fantastic. Very very exciting.

24:46.910 --> 24:49.177
It must be so cool to
wake up and go to work

24:49.212 --> 24:51.179
every day knowing you're helping people.

24:51.214 --> 24:52.884
All I get to do is say,

24:52.885 --> 24:54.850
"swirl or side by side?"

24:54.884 --> 24:56.919
You know, dad,

24:56.953 --> 25:00.589
now that Bay has bailed, you've
got an opening in your office.

25:00.623 --> 25:03.859
What about Nikki working there?

25:03.893 --> 25:05.427
Even part time?

25:06.629 --> 25:07.796
That would be amazing.

25:07.830 --> 25:10.432
I think that is a great idea.

25:10.466 --> 25:12.668
Okay, great.

25:12.702 --> 25:14.336
I'm happy to have you.

25:14.370 --> 25:17.439
Keeping it in the family.

25:17.473 --> 25:19.508
Does anyone want some iced tea?

25:19.542 --> 25:22.311
- Thank you.
- You two aren't having wine tonight?

25:22.345 --> 25:23.412
No.

25:25.448 --> 25:28.150
- You don't have to do that.
- Oh, no problem.

25:30.909 --> 25:32.976
Hey! So I had an idea.

25:33.011 --> 25:36.046
Why don't we do something like
this for the rehearsal dinner?

25:36.080 --> 25:37.948
What do you mean?

25:37.982 --> 25:40.918
A barbecue, like at a park maybe.

25:40.952 --> 25:43.654
I mean, it would be so fun.
And all my little cousins

25:43.688 --> 25:47.758
could run around the playground
and everyone can help man the grill

25:47.792 --> 25:50.260
and this way we can invite more people.

25:51.663 --> 25:55.299
I'm not sure a park is that special.

25:56.367 --> 25:58.168
But then we could take the money

25:58.236 --> 26:01.038
that you were going to spend on flowers

26:01.072 --> 26:04.174
and fondue bars and give it to a charity.

26:04.208 --> 26:06.209
Like the one in Peru...

26:06.244 --> 26:09.046
We give a lot to charity...
to a lot of charities.

26:09.080 --> 26:11.048
No, I know that, but...

26:11.082 --> 26:12.899
This is my son's wedding,

26:12.951 --> 26:15.919
his only wedding, I presume,

26:15.954 --> 26:18.789
and I would like it to be beautiful.

26:18.823 --> 26:20.857
- I'm sure it will be...
- But for who?

26:20.892 --> 26:23.660
I mean who are we trying to impress?

26:23.695 --> 26:27.364
Because all I want to do is
celebrate our families joining.

26:27.398 --> 26:32.269
And it just seems a bit wasteful

26:32.303 --> 26:35.105
for something that is going
to be over in a few hours.

26:36.274 --> 26:38.175
I agree.

26:38.002 --> 26:40.804
I got married at the
courthouse, and frankly,

26:40.838 --> 26:42.939
I can't imagine doing it any other way.

26:42.974 --> 26:45.041
That's because your marriage was a fraud.

26:46.077 --> 26:47.778
That's not the point.

26:47.845 --> 26:49.679
Spending thousands of dollars on a dress

26:49.714 --> 26:51.882
you're never gonna wear again? It's insane.

26:51.916 --> 26:54.785
It's an iconic moment.
Those pictures are something

26:54.819 --> 26:56.820
that you'll look at for
the rest of your life

26:56.854 --> 27:00.390
to remind you of the bond
you made to each other.

27:00.424 --> 27:01.691
Some moments are bigger

27:01.726 --> 27:04.394
than the math of how much a dress costs.

27:04.428 --> 27:06.196
Depends who's doing the math.

27:10.301 --> 27:13.403
Well, I guess it's something
that we can think about.

27:17.520 --> 27:18.917

27:18.918 --> 27:20.904

27:37.761 --> 27:39.663
Hi!

27:39.697 --> 27:41.531
I brought cookies.

27:52.343 --> 27:54.411
- Cool.
- Hey!

27:55.745 --> 27:57.056

27:57.947 --> 27:59.054

28:22.540 --> 28:25.413
__

28:26.677 --> 28:28.928
She's a little older, isn't she?

28:28.929 --> 28:31.075
__

28:31.076 --> 28:33.714
__

28:36.030 --> 28:38.853
__

28:39.874 --> 28:42.990
__

28:43.895 --> 28:45.929
This is a Caribbean tortuga cake.

28:45.947 --> 28:47.163
It's supposed to have a rum glaze,

28:47.198 --> 28:49.132
but we substituted vanilla instead.

28:49.166 --> 28:51.801
- Mmm.
- Okay, that's it.

28:51.836 --> 28:54.070
- What's wrong?
- Drink wine.

28:54.105 --> 28:55.906
Put a teaspoon of rum in the cake.

28:55.940 --> 28:57.641
Just live your lives!

28:57.675 --> 28:59.476
You don't have to baby me, please.

28:59.510 --> 29:00.810
- It's making me a little crazy.
- Mom.

29:00.878 --> 29:03.680
- What? It is.
- Regina, we're not babying you.

29:03.714 --> 29:06.483
Okay? I ask Kathryn to
keep the candy away from me

29:06.517 --> 29:08.285
when I'm trying to lose a few pounds.

29:08.319 --> 29:10.654
I don't really think eating candy
and alcoholism are the same thing.

29:10.688 --> 29:11.896
Sure it is. It's willpower.

29:12.090 --> 29:13.072
Not really.

29:13.073 --> 29:16.385
Neurobiologists have studied
the brains of addicts.

29:16.494 --> 29:18.328
We're genetically wired differently.

29:18.362 --> 29:20.196
I see. Well, even if that were the case,

29:20.231 --> 29:23.066
it doesn't take responsibility
off of the person drinking.

29:23.100 --> 29:25.268
Guys, I don't think we
should get into this.

29:25.303 --> 29:26.634
I have to agree.

29:26.635 --> 29:28.995
I mean is it "the disease"
that came into our living room

29:28.996 --> 29:30.414
and took a bottle of Stoli?

29:34.829 --> 29:38.598
Thank you, John, for
making this process so easy.

29:38.633 --> 29:39.566
Mom, stop!

29:40.568 --> 29:42.636
We're all just trying to help.

29:42.670 --> 29:43.737
"We"?

29:43.771 --> 29:46.439
Suddenly it's "we"?

29:51.312 --> 29:54.347
Another family dinner bites the dust.

30:04.675 --> 30:07.610
I'm gone six weeks and you
turn into a mini version of her!

30:07.645 --> 30:10.146
- Hey!
- And him... lecturing me like that.

30:10.181 --> 30:13.083
I cringe to think of the things
they said about me when I was gone.

30:13.117 --> 30:16.252
What are you talking about? They
didn't say anything bad about you.

30:16.287 --> 30:19.255
- Yeah right.
- What did you expect me to do?

30:19.273 --> 30:22.792
- You were gone for six weeks.
- Getting myself better!

30:22.827 --> 30:25.962
- You drank and lied.
- Because I was lying to myself.

30:25.996 --> 30:29.666
Just like before... day
after day, year after year

30:29.700 --> 30:31.735
when you knew about the
switch and didn't tell me.

30:31.769 --> 30:33.069
The switch! We're back to that?

30:33.104 --> 30:35.905
Do you know how easy it
was when you were gone?

30:35.940 --> 30:38.942
I didn't have to worry
about people fighting over me

30:38.976 --> 30:40.777
or taking care of you!

30:40.811 --> 30:44.547
Well, I'm sorry if me coming home
has disrupted your perfect life here.

30:44.582 --> 30:46.816
You deserted me!

30:46.851 --> 30:48.485
They were there.

30:48.519 --> 30:51.287
You should be thanking them
instead of yelling at them.

31:04.201 --> 31:06.102
Mom, is it okay if I
go out for a little bit?

31:06.137 --> 31:08.071
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

31:11.158 --> 31:14.077
That day at the club was the
first time I've seen my mom

31:14.111 --> 31:16.012
excited about our engagement.

31:16.046 --> 31:17.914
Okay, Toby.

31:17.948 --> 31:20.083
Our name in lights in a pool?

31:20.117 --> 31:23.019
- It's weird.
- It'll make her happy.

31:23.053 --> 31:26.039
- What's the big deal?
- I'm just...

31:26.073 --> 31:28.641
I'm trying to picture all of my

31:28.676 --> 31:30.860
aunts and uncles from Milwaukee...

31:30.895 --> 31:34.664
and our priest... at a fondue bar.

31:34.698 --> 31:37.634
Reverend Steven is not going
to come to the rehearsal dinner.

31:37.668 --> 31:39.769
Even if he did, he's not gonna judge.

31:39.804 --> 31:41.604
He's not allowed to.

31:41.639 --> 31:44.274
That weekend is supposed to be about us.

31:45.509 --> 31:47.377
And these are not my values.

31:47.411 --> 31:49.379
Wait, is that what you think of my family?

31:49.413 --> 31:51.314
That we're just vacuous
country-club people?

31:51.348 --> 31:52.515
No...

31:55.419 --> 31:57.270
No.

31:57.321 --> 31:59.055
Of course not.

31:59.089 --> 32:01.191
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

32:01.225 --> 32:02.892
- Sure.
- Okay.

32:21.939 --> 32:23.284
__

32:24.030 --> 32:27.470
__

32:31.824 --> 32:32.934
__

32:33.785 --> 32:36.247
- __
- __

32:37.545 --> 32:39.362
- Oh my God, it's her.
- Who?

32:39.413 --> 32:41.414
- His ex-girlfriend!
- We're leaving.

32:41.448 --> 32:43.216
- We're leaving.
- Uh, bye.

32:43.217 --> 32:45.843
- __
- __

32:54.624 --> 32:56.427
__

33:11.779 --> 33:14.614
Hey.

33:14.648 --> 33:15.949
What are you doing here?

33:15.983 --> 33:18.418
What do you mean? I got your text.

33:18.452 --> 33:20.420
What text?

33:20.454 --> 33:23.523
- Your text.
- "I need you! I must see you now!"

33:23.591 --> 33:26.459
You took my phone?

33:28.429 --> 33:30.563
So... this was a trick?

33:30.598 --> 33:34.167
"Oh, Ty, ooh!

33:34.201 --> 33:36.035
You're such a good kisser!"

33:36.070 --> 33:38.304
What are you doing?

33:38.339 --> 33:40.023
She wants you, dude. Go for it.

33:40.074 --> 33:41.991
You're gonna humiliate a girl like that?

33:42.042 --> 33:44.844
- You're gonna disrespect her?
- Ty, I'm okay.

33:44.879 --> 33:46.980
- Apologize to her.
- Get out of my face, man.

33:47.047 --> 33:48.748
Hey, Mendoza, relax.

33:50.017 --> 33:52.819
Don't ever disrespect a girl
like that again. Do you hear me?

33:52.853 --> 33:53.987
- Ever.
- Ty, don't!

33:54.021 --> 33:55.788
I'm sorry! Let go, I'm sorry.

33:55.823 --> 33:57.724
- Chill out.
- Get off of me!

33:57.758 --> 33:59.626
I'm sorry.

34:13.407 --> 34:15.190
Are you going back to rehab?

34:17.311 --> 34:20.146
No. I have to...

34:20.179 --> 34:24.050
Figure out how to live
here... in the real world.

34:24.083 --> 34:26.985
Well, where are you going?

34:27.021 --> 34:29.022
I talked to Angelo.

34:29.089 --> 34:31.056
He said I could stay over there.

34:31.091 --> 34:32.958
For how long?

34:32.993 --> 34:34.193
I... I don't know.

34:34.228 --> 34:37.163
Living here has always been a
little tough on my self-esteem,

34:37.197 --> 34:38.998
and right now...

34:39.033 --> 34:42.034
You need to give us time to readjust too.

34:42.069 --> 34:43.969
I know,

34:44.004 --> 34:46.873
and I shouldn't have gotten so angry.

34:50.577 --> 34:54.447
The most important thing
right now is that I stay sober.

34:55.516 --> 34:57.417
And to do that,

34:57.451 --> 34:59.385
I need my own space.

35:01.622 --> 35:04.190
I'm not going with you.

35:05.492 --> 35:08.161
Please try to understand.

35:09.196 --> 35:10.430
Okay.

35:15.102 --> 35:18.771
I guess I should go back over there.

35:20.975 --> 35:24.043
Okay.

35:34.671 --> 35:36.405
Why did you have to go at her like that?

35:36.439 --> 35:37.606
Me? What about her?

35:37.640 --> 35:39.675
Daphne and I worked so hard on that meal,

35:39.709 --> 35:41.577
trying to make it nice for everybody.

35:41.611 --> 35:44.346
We're not the perfect family
from your perfect book.

35:44.381 --> 35:45.381
Oh.

35:46.483 --> 35:49.151
I'm sorry. I had a horrible day.

35:50.420 --> 35:53.322
I had like 95 phone calls
from irate constituents

35:53.356 --> 35:56.258
all wanting me to fix things
the previous guy couldn't fix.

35:56.292 --> 35:58.961
And then there was this bill,
with writing like this big,

35:58.995 --> 36:01.897
that I was supposed to get through and
have coherent notes on in like three hours.

36:01.931 --> 36:04.066
Please.

36:08.171 --> 36:10.773
I'm sorry that I ruined your dinner.

36:12.776 --> 36:14.710
I ruined it too...

36:14.744 --> 36:17.946
arguing with Nikki about tea candles.

36:21.484 --> 36:23.485
We're losing him.

36:23.520 --> 36:25.704
Oh sweetie.

36:25.755 --> 36:29.525
I know it's gonna happen some time,

36:29.559 --> 36:32.461
but it just feels too soon.

36:33.496 --> 36:35.230
Yeah.

36:35.265 --> 36:38.400
You know, forcing tea candles on Nikki

36:38.435 --> 36:41.136
isn't going to really change things.

36:42.338 --> 36:44.239
I know.

36:48.478 --> 36:50.412
So...

36:50.447 --> 36:52.314
Barbecue?

36:54.918 --> 36:56.919
Yeah.

36:56.953 --> 36:59.188
But we're serving filet mignon.

37:18.575 --> 37:20.559
Where is everybody?

37:20.593 --> 37:22.444
In bed.

37:22.479 --> 37:24.746
I think that dinner
just tired everyone out.

37:26.483 --> 37:28.484
Then what are you doing here?

37:30.453 --> 37:32.588
Regina's staying at
Angelo's for a few days.

37:32.622 --> 37:36.325
I don't understand. Why
did she go to Angelo's?

37:37.527 --> 37:41.196
I guess she needed some alone time.

37:41.231 --> 37:43.298
Because six weeks wasn't enough?

37:43.333 --> 37:45.100
I don't know. Ask her.

37:45.135 --> 37:47.069
She didn't exactly consult me either.

37:47.103 --> 37:49.071
Okay, so she just left... again...

37:49.105 --> 37:50.873
and she didn't even tell me?

37:50.907 --> 37:53.008
You know what?

37:53.026 --> 37:56.245
I'm sick of you yelling at me for
things that I have zero control over.

Why do you keep leaving without telling me?

40:37.340 --> 40:40.208
Oh, I'm sorry.

40:40.243 --> 40:42.044
I had to get out of there.

40:42.078 --> 40:43.962
I was going to call you in the morning.

40:43.997 --> 40:46.114
You've lived in my house

40:46.149 --> 40:48.300
all this time and we
barely know each other.

40:48.334 --> 40:50.168
That's not true.

40:50.219 --> 40:52.888
What's the most time
we've ever spent together?

40:52.922 --> 40:55.257
Two hours while we were painting my mural?

40:55.291 --> 40:58.260
My mom and Daphne have
so much time together,

40:58.294 --> 41:00.195
but you...

41:00.229 --> 41:02.864
you don't ever want me around.

41:02.899 --> 41:05.167
Bay, that is not true.

41:05.201 --> 41:07.202
Why do you push me away?

41:07.236 --> 41:10.105
Why don't you want to spend time with me?

41:17.280 --> 41:19.981
I do...

41:20.016 --> 41:21.283
want to spend time with you.

41:23.086 --> 41:24.853
A lot more time.

41:26.856 --> 41:29.291
I felt so guilty for not coming to get you.

41:33.930 --> 41:36.131
I had to pretend that you

41:36.165 --> 41:38.834
didn't exist so it wouldn't hurt so much.

41:41.204 --> 41:43.238
And then...

41:43.272 --> 41:46.007
by the time I met you...

41:47.310 --> 41:51.179
it was just... it was
hard to undo all that.

41:55.985 --> 41:57.853
Can I stay the night?

41:59.355 --> 42:01.089
Yes.

42:01.124 --> 42:04.159
Stay.

42:04.193 --> 42:06.094
Please?

42:07.163 --> 42:08.864
You can stay as long as you want.
