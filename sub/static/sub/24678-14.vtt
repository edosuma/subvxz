Narrator:
In the New York City war on crime,

00:03.836 --> 00:07.216
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:07.241 --> 00:08.914
of the Major Case Squad.

00:08.942 --> 00:11.479
These are their stories.

00:12.479 --> 00:15.653
This is the most stupid thing
you've ever done. I told you, Lucas--

00:15.682 --> 00:17.958
I told you not to get involved
with those people.

00:17.985 --> 00:20.556
If you stopped acting
like a moron and listened to me--

00:20.587 --> 00:22.328
Please, I just need your answer.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.529
- Yes or no?
- No, I won't do it.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.595
Dad, please.

00:26.627 --> 00:30.006
- Just this one time.
- Your mother thought you'd
amount to something.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.874
Thank God she isn't here
to see what a disgrace

00:32.900 --> 00:34.709
you turned out to be.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.245
$55's the best I can do.

00:40.274 --> 00:42.083
I know it's not what you want to hear;

00:42.109 --> 00:43.952
but Iâ€™m carrying too much inventory.

00:43.977 --> 00:45.957
I bought it from you guys just last year.

00:45.979 --> 00:48.118
Look, why don't you hang on to the car?

00:48.148 --> 00:51.960
Somebody comes in here wanting this exact
color, maybe then I can do better.

00:51.985 --> 00:56.161
- It's got to be today.
- $55's the best I can do today.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.872
Okay, I'll need a cashier's check.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:09.002 --> 01:11.312
This looks like, what, $100 grand?

01:11.338 --> 01:13.978
$112,000

01:14.007 --> 01:17.716
Mr. Colter, I think I was pretty clear about
the terms of the loan.

01:17.744 --> 01:20.691
I just need 3 more days. 5 at the most.

01:22.516 --> 01:26.828
You've known this day
was coming for, what, 6 months?

01:26.853 --> 01:30.767
- If you're not good for the money, just tell me.
- No, I'm good for it.

01:30.791 --> 01:33.863
I just need a few more days. Please.

01:38.365 --> 01:40.038
Thanks for the drink.

01:41.969 --> 01:45.348
I don't care about the tax penalties, Phil.
This is an emergency.

01:45.372 --> 01:47.682
Why do I need her signature?

01:47.708 --> 01:49.688
What about the college fund?

01:49.710 --> 01:52.190
Why do we have to tell the bank anything?

01:52.212 --> 01:54.624
Dad, Liza's father can't
coach Saturday's game--

01:54.648 --> 01:56.855
- Sorry.
- I'll call you back.

01:56.883 --> 01:59.523
- What about Liza?
- Her dad's got the flu.

01:59.553 --> 02:02.295
- Can you coach on Saturday?
- Sure, no problem.

02:02.322 --> 02:04.302
Maggie, I can't find your sweater.

02:04.324 --> 02:06.463
Maggie: I don't really need it.

02:06.493 --> 02:08.632
I put your gloves out.

02:08.662 --> 02:11.302
- You all right, sweetie?
- Just the usual work stuff.

02:11.331 --> 02:14.471
- I'm gonna go for my run.
- We won't be here when you get back.

02:14.501 --> 02:17.641
Mom's coming over. We're taking
her to the Amish farmer's market.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.673
Bye, sweeties.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.817
- You took the last yogurt.
- Here.

02:25.846 --> 02:28.725
Stop whining, you're not a baby anymore.

02:34.021 --> 02:36.661
Joan, what are you doing out here?

02:36.690 --> 02:39.694
- Where's Susan? Where are the girls?
- What do you mean?

02:39.726 --> 02:41.763
I've been ringing the bell for a half hour.

02:41.795 --> 02:45.368
Nobody's home. I tried Susan's
cell phone, she doesn't answer.

02:53.206 --> 02:56.517
Susan? Maggie?!

02:56.543 --> 02:58.181
Sarah?!

02:59.613 --> 03:02.116
Joan: What's going on, Lucas?
Where are they?

03:02.149 --> 03:05.392
Everything's okay. It's Maggie.

03:05.419 --> 03:07.456
She was feeling sick when I left.

03:07.487 --> 03:10.058
Susan said she might take her
to the doctor's.

03:10.090 --> 03:13.037
Probably didn't want
to leave Sarah home alone.

03:13.060 --> 03:15.802
She would've left a note or a message.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.968
Maggie's sick, that's all.

03:17.998 --> 03:20.274
They're fine, Joan. I promise.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.405
I'll make sure that Susan calls you.

03:22.436 --> 03:25.076
Now, could you please
let me get ready for work?

03:29.009 --> 03:30.989
Oh God.

03:31.011 --> 03:33.048
Oh God, please don't hurt them.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.188
( theme music playing )

04:23.663 --> 04:25.336
I called Dr. Charter's office.

04:25.365 --> 04:26.969
They haven't heard from Susan.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.843
What about the hospitals, St. Luke's?

04:28.869 --> 04:30.974
No, the officers at the precinct called them.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.984
Lennox Hill, Mt. Sinai.

04:33.006 --> 04:35.577
Lucas lied. Maggie isn't sick.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.647
The detective at the precinct
said you saw signs of a struggle.

04:38.678 --> 04:40.316
No, I didn't say struggle.

04:40.347 --> 04:42.327
The umbrella stand was knocked over,

04:42.349 --> 04:45.193
and somebody dropped
a carton of yogurt on the floor.

04:46.186 --> 04:49.167
Does your son-in-law jog
this same time every morning?

04:49.189 --> 04:51.601
- Yes.
- Eames: Any problems in their marriage?

04:51.625 --> 04:55.903
No, I just know Lucas has been
very preoccupied with work lately.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.933
But you sensed that he knew something
had happened to his family?

04:58.965 --> 05:01.605
Yes. Yes, he knew something.

05:01.635 --> 05:04.411
Deakins: Does your son-in-law
have money? A lot of money?

05:04.437 --> 05:07.611
I don't know about a lot.
He and Susan live very well.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.121
We'll need information on your son-in-law.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.623
Phone numbers, bank accounts,
that sort of thing.

05:12.646 --> 05:15.650
- Did you tell anyone you were
coming to the police?
- No.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.996
You think they've been kidnapped for ransom?

05:22.088 --> 05:24.193
Yes, ma'am, it looks that way.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.162
( doorbell chimes )

05:30.163 --> 05:32.234
Hi, I'm Alexa, this is Bobby.

05:32.265 --> 05:34.973
We're conducting a ministry
in your neighborhood today.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.675
We want to tell you about the
good news in the Good Book.

05:37.704 --> 05:40.480
- I don't have time.
- Sure you do.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.350
Just look at the pamphlet.

05:42.375 --> 05:45.618
They might be watching the house,
so just look at the pamphlet.

05:45.645 --> 05:47.420
I don't know what you're talking about.

05:47.447 --> 05:50.553
If you think you can get your wife
and kids back safe without our help--

05:50.584 --> 05:54.657
- My wife and kids are safe.
- We spoke with your mother-in-law.

05:54.688 --> 05:57.726
- They went to the doctor's.
- Come on now, that's not true.

05:57.757 --> 06:00.033
We know they're missing.

06:02.462 --> 06:05.534
You want the truth? We had
a fight this morning.

06:05.565 --> 06:08.603
My wife left with the girls.
I don't know where they went.

06:08.635 --> 06:12.048
- Mr. Colter, you have no choice here.
- You have to let us handle this.

06:12.072 --> 06:15.542
Everything's fine. Just leave me alone.

06:18.144 --> 06:20.283
You can keep these pamphlet to read.

06:20.313 --> 06:22.156
And God bless you for talking to us.

06:25.652 --> 06:27.996
Colter won't play ball. He's scared.

06:28.021 --> 06:30.729
Special Services just got
the paperwork from the DA's.

06:30.757 --> 06:32.566
They're putting the taps on his phones.

06:32.592 --> 06:35.505
We're going to his bank.
Anything moves here, call us.

06:38.498 --> 06:39.943
Done.

06:39.966 --> 06:44.142
If there's any unusual activity
in Mr. Colter's account, you'll
be notified immediately.

06:44.170 --> 06:46.514
- How much is in there?
- $22,000.

06:46.539 --> 06:49.986
- What are all these over there?
- Third-party checks he cashed at the bank.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.320
$17,000, $32,000, $57,000--

06:52.345 --> 06:55.121
$112,000, all in the last two weeks.

06:55.148 --> 06:57.788
What's this check here for $55,000?

06:59.519 --> 07:01.863
A cashier's check from Midtown Porsche.

07:01.888 --> 07:05.097
The other checks are payouts
from brokerage inns.

07:05.125 --> 07:08.971
He sold his car, he sold stocks.
Looks like he knew he'd need the money.

07:10.964 --> 07:13.171
Maybe the ransom isn't a ransom.

07:16.903 --> 07:19.213
He's the Chief Operating Officer
of this company.

07:19.239 --> 07:22.186
- If he's in trouble, I need to know.
- Could you close the door?

07:26.646 --> 07:28.956
Did he mention any threats lately?

07:28.982 --> 07:30.620
No.

07:30.650 --> 07:32.652
You notice any change in mood?

07:33.820 --> 07:36.300
Short-tempered, you know, distracted?

07:36.323 --> 07:38.303
No. Luke's pretty intense anyway.

07:38.325 --> 07:41.795
- What about financial problems?
- We're a hedge fund company.

07:41.828 --> 07:44.138
There's always problems,
and it's always about money.

07:44.164 --> 07:46.371
I meant personal. Does he owe money, gamble?

07:46.399 --> 07:49.972
If we knew he had a gambling problem,
we wouldn't be in business with him.

07:50.003 --> 07:52.916
Anyway, his wife came
into some family money last year.

07:52.939 --> 07:55.078
- She did?
- That's what he said.

07:55.108 --> 07:58.646
He bought a Porsche.
Took his family to Sardinia last summer.

07:58.678 --> 08:00.658
Cali Di Volpe-- $1,500 bucks a day.

08:00.680 --> 08:04.594
Isn't that standard recreation
for you hedge fund guys?

08:04.617 --> 08:06.927
Yeah, well, there are no millionaires here.

08:06.953 --> 08:09.297
Last summer might've been a different story.

08:13.960 --> 08:16.440
One of the big firms made a buyout offer.

08:16.463 --> 08:19.034
Everything was on track,
their examiners were happy.

08:19.065 --> 08:22.603
So Colter might've been
expecting a big payoff.

08:22.635 --> 08:25.275
$3.5 million. Then 9/11 happened.

08:25.305 --> 08:27.285
The buyers withdrew their offer,

08:27.307 --> 08:29.344
and then with no bonuses last year...

08:29.376 --> 08:30.946
Colter was living beyond his means.

08:30.977 --> 08:33.924
He was tapped out at the bank.
Maybe he went to the street for a loan.

08:34.914 --> 08:37.360
- And now the loan's due.
- ( cell phone ringing )

08:39.652 --> 08:41.289
Eames.

08:41.321 --> 08:43.130
Okay, call us back with a location.

08:43.155 --> 08:45.432
We'll hook up with you. Colter's on the move.

08:56.002 --> 08:58.141
He's been waiting there about 10 minutes.

08:58.171 --> 09:01.380
Phone company's working on setting
up a trace on all four phones.

09:02.942 --> 09:05.752
-( phone rings)
- Hello?

09:05.779 --> 09:08.089
- Man: Lucas Colter?
- Yes, it's me.

09:08.114 --> 09:11.687
- Do you have all the money?
- No, no. First I want to talk to my wife.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.823
What are you talking about, "you want"?

09:13.853 --> 09:16.197
What you want, I don't care.

09:16.222 --> 09:19.999
- I care about the money.
- I told you people yesterday I need 5 days.

09:20.026 --> 09:22.097
5 days is going to be

09:22.128 --> 09:24.938
a very long time for your family.

09:24.964 --> 09:27.774
Maybe you want to try harder to get the money.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.803
Colter: I will. Just don't hurt them.

09:29.836 --> 09:32.112
This is your choice. You get the money,

09:32.138 --> 09:34.675
- you don't tell the police.
- I haven't told them.

09:34.707 --> 09:37.381
And youâ€™ll never tell them.
They will put you in jail,

09:37.410 --> 09:39.788
and I will come back and kill your family.

09:39.813 --> 09:42.623
I swear; I won't say anything.

09:42.649 --> 09:45.289
- You love your wife?
- Yes.

09:45.318 --> 09:47.798
And you love your beautiful daughters?

09:47.821 --> 09:49.459
Colter: Yes. Please.

09:49.489 --> 09:51.799
Man: Tell me, which one you like better?

09:51.825 --> 09:53.463
Maggie or Sarah?

09:58.498 --> 10:01.138
- I don't know.
- Oh.

10:01.167 --> 10:03.477
Me, I like Maggie.

10:03.503 --> 10:07.076
Me and Maggie are going to have party.

10:08.374 --> 10:10.650
And we are going to have party

10:10.677 --> 10:12.657
until you deliver the money.

10:12.679 --> 10:14.488
What?! Wait!

10:14.514 --> 10:16.516
- Now talk to your wife.
- No!

10:16.549 --> 10:18.654
Wait, what are you going to do?!

10:18.685 --> 10:20.665
Iâ€™ll get you the money, anything.

10:20.687 --> 10:22.826
Please, don't hurt my family!

10:22.856 --> 10:24.836
- Lucas?
- Susan, what's he doing?

10:24.858 --> 10:26.667
I don't know. I can't see.

10:26.693 --> 10:28.502
No more, Britney. Come on!

10:28.528 --> 10:31.168
- ( sobbing )
- What are you doing? Maggie?

10:31.197 --> 10:33.871
- Maggie!
- You like to fight?!

10:33.900 --> 10:35.937
- Leave her alone!
- I like to fight, too.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.971
You touch her, I'll kill you! Maggie!

10:38.004 --> 10:39.881
What's going on? What's he doing to her?

10:39.906 --> 10:42.546
( screaming )

10:44.377 --> 10:47.221
Please, don't touch her. Please.

10:47.247 --> 10:49.557
She's just a little girl. Please.

10:50.550 --> 10:52.826
Please, leave her alone!

10:52.852 --> 10:54.957
- She's just a little girl!
- ( screaming )

10:54.988 --> 10:58.697
Maggie, Mommy's here, baby. Mommy's here.

10:58.725 --> 11:00.636
- Susan?
- Lucas, damn you,

11:00.660 --> 11:02.571
whatever they want, just give it to them.

11:02.595 --> 11:05.337
Tell them I'll get the money today.
Just tell him to stop!

11:06.332 --> 11:07.834
Susan?

11:07.867 --> 11:09.744
Susan?!

11:16.976 --> 11:18.785
They weren't able to get a trace.

11:23.983 --> 11:26.930
- Mr. Colter.
- Get away from me.

11:26.953 --> 11:30.264
We know you borrowed money.
If you give us a name, we can find them.

11:30.290 --> 11:31.598
You can't help me!

11:39.899 --> 11:42.675
Lucas has a mortgage. That's
the only loan on his books.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.444
- This loan wouldn't be on the books.
- From a loan shark?

11:45.471 --> 11:48.350
- I don't know anything about that.
- You're his accountant.

11:48.374 --> 11:51.287
Didn't you notice he paid off
a lot of overdue bills 6 months ago?

11:51.311 --> 11:54.019
Excuse me, but why am I even talking to you?

11:54.047 --> 11:55.890
You don't have a subpoena or a warrant.

11:55.915 --> 12:00.057
We think the people he owes
money to kidnapped his family.

12:01.154 --> 12:04.294
Oh, Jeez. Susan and the kids?

12:04.324 --> 12:06.634
Now you want to help us, right?

12:11.531 --> 12:14.273
I knew Lucas was trying to raise
cash the last couple of weeks.

12:14.300 --> 12:17.338
He didn't tell me why. I didn't even know
he was having money problems.

12:17.370 --> 12:20.010
Six months ago, end of last summer,

12:20.039 --> 12:21.814
how much cash did he have on hand?

12:25.178 --> 12:26.714
Not much.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.818
That's when his company got the buyout offer.

12:29.849 --> 12:32.455
The buyer would have had
auditors going over the books.

12:32.485 --> 12:36.092
If Lucas was dipping into company funds,
he'd have to put the money back fast.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.570
So he went to a loan shark.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.267
Lucas is an embezzler?

12:42.295 --> 12:44.070
Oh, Jeez.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.543
No wonder he doesn't want our help.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.013
Dad, this time I really need that money.

12:51.037 --> 12:53.517
No! No, no, no. I told you--

12:53.539 --> 12:55.485
They took Susan and the girls.

12:55.508 --> 12:59.012
They kidnapped them! I have
to give them the money today.

13:00.380 --> 13:03.054
You dummy. Did you call the police?

13:03.082 --> 13:04.823
- No.
- We have to call them.

13:04.851 --> 13:06.489
The banks close in two hours!

13:06.519 --> 13:09.295
- We have to get the money now!
- The police know how to stall.

13:09.322 --> 13:12.064
Listen to me! Just listen to me!

13:14.327 --> 13:16.967
I talked on the phone
to the man who took them.

13:16.996 --> 13:19.340
This...

13:19.365 --> 13:21.470
Then he put Susan on

13:21.501 --> 13:24.209
and she heard him raping Maggie.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.319
He raped her.

13:28.341 --> 13:31.117
Oh my God, Lucas.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.981
You have to help me get them back.

13:37.016 --> 13:40.327
I'll call the bank. I'll get the money.

13:40.353 --> 13:44.130
Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.831
I'll take care of everything.

13:46.859 --> 13:49.362
I'll get them back.

13:49.395 --> 13:51.238
I'll get them back.

13:55.001 --> 13:57.379
His accountant found almost a million bucks

13:57.403 --> 14:00.247
of unexplained income
over the last year and a half.

14:00.273 --> 14:03.152
- Guy was stealing with both hands.
- Eames: All right, thank you.

14:03.176 --> 14:06.817
The company found an account Colter set up
for a non-existent office supply house.

14:06.846 --> 14:10.123
- That's how he was embezzling.
- We gotta make this guy talk to us.

14:10.149 --> 14:13.562
Make is a big word. He's not moved
by the spirit of cooperation.

14:13.586 --> 14:15.623
He embezzled his company.

14:15.655 --> 14:18.158
Pick him up for grand larceny
and step into him.

14:19.992 --> 14:22.973
(moaning)

14:22.995 --> 14:24.997
Enough!

14:28.334 --> 14:30.371
I think you like it this time.

14:32.672 --> 14:35.346
I think next time you'll like it better.

14:37.343 --> 14:39.289
(whimpers)

14:39.312 --> 14:40.882
Don't move.

14:45.852 --> 14:48.332
Don't get mad at me.

14:48.354 --> 14:51.995
I just collect a little interest
on your daddy's loan.

14:52.024 --> 14:53.901
Get mad at him.

14:56.996 --> 14:59.033
He is weak man.

15:01.467 --> 15:03.003
Men like him,

15:03.035 --> 15:06.448
they are food for wolves.

15:06.472 --> 15:08.645
( clicks )

15:08.674 --> 15:11.655
(phone chiming theme from "Bonanza")

15:19.886 --> 15:22.298
Simon: Okay.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.729
How much?

15:27.293 --> 15:29.603
Okay.

15:29.629 --> 15:32.075
Yes, it's in place. Yes.

15:33.065 --> 15:34.908
Okay.

15:43.009 --> 15:45.990
Eames: Mr. Colter?

15:46.012 --> 15:48.151
Mr. Colter, did you hear what I said?

15:48.181 --> 15:49.717
Your secret's out.

15:49.749 --> 15:52.320
The company knows you stole from them.

15:52.351 --> 15:54.661
He's not admitting to any of this.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.826
We don't care about his confession.

15:56.856 --> 15:58.995
Look, you've got nothing to lose now.

15:59.025 --> 16:01.437
Just give us the name of the loan shark.

16:01.461 --> 16:05.432
Lawyer: If he cooperates, what consideration
can he expect on the larceny charge?

16:05.465 --> 16:08.935
I don't care about that.
I don't have anything to say to them.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.777
Mr. Colter, if you don't help us,

16:10.803 --> 16:14.410
you are responsible
for what happens to your family.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.986
We're wasting our time.

16:23.149 --> 16:24.753
Aren't we?

16:24.784 --> 16:26.821
Youâ€™re not scared of going to prison.

16:26.853 --> 16:30.494
You're scared of what they might do
to your family if you talk to us.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.972
You're scared to death

16:34.994 --> 16:37.031
that you might make a mistake.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.973
How many kidnappings have you handled?

16:43.002 --> 16:45.039
Between us,

16:45.071 --> 16:47.483
Detective Eames and I
have done nearly a dozen.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.453
That's not counting hostage situations.

16:49.475 --> 16:51.318
And so far, knock on wood,

16:51.344 --> 16:53.483
we haven't lost anybody.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.151
But on your own,

16:55.181 --> 16:58.719
there are a million ways
a kidnap victim can end up dead.

17:01.621 --> 17:04.625
Even if you catch a lucky break, Lucas,

17:04.656 --> 17:06.432
you get them back safe and sound,

17:06.459 --> 17:10.999
unless those people are in jail, it will never
be over for you, your wife and your kids.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.943
- I want to talk to my client.
- You don't need to make any deals.

17:13.965 --> 17:15.968
- Detective.
- ( knocking )

17:28.814 --> 17:30.487
They're out.

17:33.819 --> 17:36.299
It was all a misunderstanding.

17:36.322 --> 17:38.461
Lucas and I had a fight,

17:38.491 --> 17:40.801
and I left and took the kids with me.

17:40.826 --> 17:43.272
But we're fine.

17:43.296 --> 17:45.401
Now please, we're very tired.

17:45.431 --> 17:48.469
Where are your daughters? Are they upstairs?

17:48.501 --> 17:50.845
You leave them alone!

17:52.004 --> 17:53.506
Hi.

17:55.007 --> 17:56.850
You must be Sarah.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.803
Hi, Maggie...

18:16.896 --> 18:20.867
I'm Bobby Goren, I'm a police detective.

18:35.481 --> 18:37.392
Susan: They need to sleep.

18:42.655 --> 18:45.295
Every bone in my body tells me she was raped.

18:45.324 --> 18:48.100
I could see it in her face.
I could see it in her mother's face.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.801
Be that as it may, as long as
her parents won't cooperate,

18:50.830 --> 18:52.969
I don't know of any judge
who'll sign an order

18:52.999 --> 18:55.639
compelling a minor to submit
to a medical examination.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.978
Forget the rape kit.
We just need a statement from her.

18:58.004 --> 19:00.143
Same problem. No judge will
compel her to testify.

19:00.172 --> 19:02.516
- If the girl wants to talk?
- Mother says she doesn't.

19:02.541 --> 19:05.351
Even if she did want to talk,
in light of her mental state,

19:05.378 --> 19:07.483
the judge would defer to her parent's wishes.

19:07.513 --> 19:09.288
What about the embezzlement charge?

19:09.315 --> 19:12.922
The idea of Colter going to jail
might convince the family to talk.

19:12.952 --> 19:15.432
The company's backing away
from filing a complaint.

19:15.454 --> 19:17.263
Bad publicity.

19:17.289 --> 19:20.862
I'm sorry, we'll have to find another way.

19:24.063 --> 19:27.237
I was mistaken. There was no kidnapping.

19:27.266 --> 19:31.373
You said there were signs of
struggles, right? You told us that.

19:31.404 --> 19:33.816
It was exactly what my daughter told you.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.285
It was a stupid little spat.

19:39.311 --> 19:42.690
We can't figure out where your son-in-law

19:42.715 --> 19:45.218
got the money to pay off this loan shark.

19:45.251 --> 19:47.288
Somebody must have given him the money.

19:47.319 --> 19:51.461
What puzzles us, he had been trying
to pay this loan for weeks.

19:53.993 --> 19:57.702
Why didn't he go to this person
before the kidnapping?

19:59.331 --> 20:02.312
Maybe he did and he got turned down,

20:02.334 --> 20:05.679
which raises interesting possibilities.

20:06.672 --> 20:10.085
For instance, your son-in-law
could've facilitated the kidnapping

20:10.109 --> 20:13.283
to extort money from this unknown person.

20:17.349 --> 20:21.491
I'm sure he didn't plan
on Maggie getting violated...

20:26.525 --> 20:29.335
But if kidnapping was the only way
to get money out--

20:29.361 --> 20:31.034
It's his father.

20:32.198 --> 20:35.338
Melvyn Colter.

20:35.367 --> 20:38.871
That old son of a bitch
has never given Lucas a break.

20:40.372 --> 20:42.648
They had a fight. What's
surprising about that?

20:42.675 --> 20:44.848
My son would try any woman's patience.

20:44.877 --> 20:47.118
Do you know how easy it is for us to find out

20:47.146 --> 20:49.353
if you withdrew a large
sum of money yesterday?

20:49.381 --> 20:51.520
- So what? I blew it on a pony.
- Which race?

20:51.550 --> 20:53.689
I forget. I don't dwell on my losses.

20:53.719 --> 20:56.893
Look, I'm going to my barber,
and if you geniuses follow me,

20:56.922 --> 21:00.699
I'll call my lawyer, and he'll call
his friends at the mayor's office.

21:01.627 --> 21:03.698
You don't care you were swindled by your son?

21:07.500 --> 21:09.639
We hear you ride him pretty hard.

21:09.668 --> 21:12.478
Nothing he does is ever good enough.

21:12.505 --> 21:13.779
You know, like when he...

21:13.806 --> 21:17.982
got those courtside seats for the playoffs
last year, just for the two of you.

21:18.010 --> 21:20.012
You didn't even bother to show up.

21:20.045 --> 21:22.116
Now he needed money.

21:22.148 --> 21:24.992
He knows he could be lying
in front of your doorstep starving

21:25.017 --> 21:27.088
and you'd step over him.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.962
But your granddaughters,

21:28.988 --> 21:31.662
well, that's the way to the old man's wallet.

21:33.526 --> 21:36.029
He staged the kidnapping, Mr. Colter.

21:38.531 --> 21:40.704
Nice try, Detective.

21:44.436 --> 21:46.848
He didn't buy it for a minute.

21:46.872 --> 21:49.352
He must know his son better than we thought.

21:50.342 --> 21:52.549
Or he knows the loan shark.

21:54.580 --> 21:58.528
A white-collar guy like Lucas Colter is not
going to have loan sharks in his Rolodex,

21:58.551 --> 22:01.122
but his dad's been in business
for himself for 40 years.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.531
Might've needed some short-term financing.

22:03.556 --> 22:05.502
Could be how Lucas heard of these people.

22:05.524 --> 22:08.630
Here, I got a UCC filing
for Melvyn Colter's company,

22:08.661 --> 22:11.471
Med-support services, from six years ago.

22:11.497 --> 22:14.637
Looks like he applied to the court
for temporary relief from creditors.

22:14.667 --> 22:17.511
- You have addresses on those creditors?
- Uh-huh.

22:24.677 --> 22:27.817
B&C Fast Credit. That sounds a little
sketchy to make business loans.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.793
Run the address through central records.

22:34.353 --> 22:38.995
Six years ago, 1219 Pell was rented
to one Carl Pettijohn.

22:39.024 --> 22:43.370
Priors for fraud, possession
of stolen goods and loan sharking.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.677
Come on, fellas.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.838
We're talking about a six-year-old loan.

22:48.868 --> 22:51.678
Melvyn Colter and I sorted that out eons ago.

22:51.704 --> 22:54.344
Then let's talk about the
loan you made to his son.

22:54.373 --> 22:55.977
$650,000.

22:56.008 --> 22:59.182
All I see here is a
normal business transaction.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.452
The interest's a little on the high side,

23:01.480 --> 23:03.153
but it's perfectly within the law.

23:03.182 --> 23:06.095
Carver: What's remarkable isn't
what Mr. Colter paid you,

23:06.118 --> 23:07.927
it's that he paid you so quickly.

23:07.953 --> 23:10.194
- That's not my client's concern.
- Yes, it is.

23:10.222 --> 23:13.669
- He had Mr. Colter's family kidnapped.
- That's a damn lie.

23:13.692 --> 23:17.868
I would never hurt anybody,
least of all somebody's family.

23:17.897 --> 23:20.400
Then someone must have ignored
your instructions,

23:20.432 --> 23:23.936
because Mr. Colter's daughter
was raped while in captivity.

23:26.505 --> 23:28.314
I looked at your record--

23:28.340 --> 23:31.617
a little arm twisting, a little leg
bending, but nothing like this.

23:31.644 --> 23:34.090
For now, I can be convinced

23:34.113 --> 23:37.617
that things got a little out of your control.

23:37.650 --> 23:40.153
The dominoes are falling, Mr. Pettijohn.

23:40.185 --> 23:43.894
You want to get ahead of them
before they fall on you.

23:47.359 --> 23:50.499
I got this guy's number, a collector.

23:50.529 --> 23:52.440
I don't even know his name.

23:52.464 --> 23:54.239
I've never used him before.

23:54.266 --> 23:58.009
- They told me he was good.
- Eames: Who told you?

23:58.037 --> 23:59.448
Nicky Torres.

23:59.471 --> 24:01.951
The guy was just supposed to get me the money.

24:01.974 --> 24:04.511
I told him I didn't want anybody hurt.

24:05.978 --> 24:08.083
Did you talk to this collector in person?

24:08.113 --> 24:10.855
No, I just called him on his phone.

24:10.883 --> 24:12.692
He's got an accent.

24:12.718 --> 24:15.324
I don't know, East European.

24:15.354 --> 24:18.335
As far as I know, not even Nicky Torres
has seen this guy.

24:19.692 --> 24:22.605
Nicky Torres is a bag man
for the Two Bridges drug gang.

24:22.628 --> 24:26.166
Anybody they use to collect their drug
debts is not going to be a pussycat.

24:26.198 --> 24:29.805
You don't think for a minute I actually
believe Pettijohn's demurrals, do you?

24:29.835 --> 24:32.748
The number Pettijohn called?
It's for a prepaid cell phone.

24:32.771 --> 24:34.250
No way to trace the owner.

24:34.273 --> 24:36.810
Maybe Torres can lead us to him.

24:36.842 --> 24:38.981
Can we get a tap on Torres' phone?

24:39.011 --> 24:41.082
I'm sure we can.

24:41.113 --> 24:44.060
Man: I let this maricon slide too long, Nicky.

24:44.083 --> 24:47.553
$87,000 and he thinks he can run a tab,
like I'm some damn bodega.

24:47.586 --> 24:49.259
Nicky: I got the man on the case.

24:49.288 --> 24:51.529
He's gonna get the money out of Benjy for us.

24:51.557 --> 24:54.060
Man: Benjy's got an excuse
for every day of the week.

24:54.093 --> 24:57.370
His old lady got to pay the doctor,
his little girl got to get braces.

24:57.396 --> 25:00.866
Nicky: He ain't gonna have no excuses now.
He's just gonna have to pay.

25:00.899 --> 25:04.938
The tape was made yesterday.
Nicky Torres and his boss, Carlito Santos.

25:04.970 --> 25:08.315
- Any idea who Benjy is?
- No.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.581
Well, we'd better find out.

25:10.609 --> 25:13.249
Some maniac's about to
grab his wife and daughter.

25:15.547 --> 25:18.926
Man: His old lady got to pay the doctor,
his little girl got to get braces.

25:18.951 --> 25:22.592
Man #2: He ain't gonna have no excuses now.
Heâ€™s just gonna have to pay.

25:23.689 --> 25:26.101
It's just two businessmen
talking about a debt.

25:26.125 --> 25:27.866
It doesn't mean anything.

25:27.893 --> 25:32.103
It means Nicky here is on the hook
for kidnapping, rape,

25:32.131 --> 25:34.611
and a lot of other violations
that all add up to,

25:34.633 --> 25:36.806
"You can kiss the daylight goodbye, Nicky."

25:36.835 --> 25:40.146
The collector-- the one with
the East European accent,

25:40.172 --> 25:44.120
the one that's going
to snatch Benjy's wife and kid?

25:44.143 --> 25:45.850
You're gonna help us find him.

25:45.878 --> 25:48.518
Attorney: Any information he may provide

25:48.547 --> 25:52.620
doesn't constitute an admission of guilt
or knowledge before or after the fact.

25:52.651 --> 25:54.358
Whatever.

25:57.689 --> 25:59.498
All I got is his number.

25:59.525 --> 26:01.596
I just call him up and
tell him what the job is.

26:01.627 --> 26:04.130
I never met the guy. I don't
even know his name.

26:06.198 --> 26:08.144
Goren: Well, his number.

26:13.972 --> 26:16.111
When you talk to him, what do you call him?

26:16.141 --> 26:17.620
"Hey, you" or...?

26:17.643 --> 26:19.122
( chuckles )

26:19.144 --> 26:21.624
I call him Little Joe.

26:21.647 --> 26:23.388
You know, like the cowboy.

26:23.415 --> 26:26.191
(laughing)

26:26.218 --> 26:28.858
What, the cowboy on "Bonanza"?

26:28.887 --> 26:31.163
- Nicky: Yeah.
- ( laughing )

26:31.190 --> 26:32.965
I was on the phone with him,

26:32.991 --> 26:36.302
and I heard the music,
you know, from the TV show.

26:36.328 --> 26:39.070
And I heard the other phone ringing.

26:39.098 --> 26:42.671
He told me he programs his phone
to play the tune.

26:42.701 --> 26:44.044
(laughing)

26:45.504 --> 26:47.882
"Bonanza." What a funny guy.

26:49.341 --> 26:50.877
Yeah, yeah.

27:00.018 --> 27:01.929
Now I want you to write Benjy's name

27:01.954 --> 27:04.127
and where he lives with his family.

27:40.159 --> 27:42.537
( car horn honking )

28:11.523 --> 28:12.524
Take him!

28:22.601 --> 28:23.636
Eames: Police!

28:27.105 --> 28:29.779
( sirens blaring )

28:57.502 --> 28:59.607
Let's go.

29:38.710 --> 29:41.589
( faint phone chiming theme from "Bonanza" )

29:48.553 --> 29:50.999
(phone chiming louder)

29:55.294 --> 29:57.535
You gonna answer that?

29:57.562 --> 29:59.838
( chiming continuing )

30:04.336 --> 30:07.317
Eames: Simon Matic, born Belgrade 1969.

30:07.339 --> 30:11.014
Immigrated in 1995, naturalized 1998.

30:11.043 --> 30:12.954
His visa application says he served

30:12.978 --> 30:15.322
four years in the Serbian Army.

30:15.347 --> 30:18.487
- Where, Bosnia?
- Yeah, and a bunch of places with no vowels.

30:18.517 --> 30:20.155
Says he was wounded in action.

30:20.185 --> 30:22.324
Let's stay focused on his activities here.

30:22.354 --> 30:25.426
There was nothing in the van or his
home to tie him to any kidnapping.

30:25.457 --> 30:27.266
- No hairs, no fibers.
- Phone records?

30:27.292 --> 30:29.829
He uses pre-paid phones,
changes them every week.

30:29.861 --> 30:32.273
Eye witnesses? He's
committed other kidnappings.

30:32.297 --> 30:34.868
Nicky Torres can provide
the names of other victims.

30:34.900 --> 30:37.710
Torres wants a total walk
in return for his cooperation.

30:37.736 --> 30:40.216
- That's out of the question.
- Then we're out of luck.

30:40.238 --> 30:43.515
- Give us a few days, we'll turn something up.
- You don't have a few days.

30:43.542 --> 30:47.012
You have 17 hours, by which time I have
to bring him up for arraignment.

30:47.045 --> 30:51.494
With the evidence I have in hand now,
I'll be lucky to get a 10Â¢ bail for him.

30:51.516 --> 30:54.861
And then, my friends, I'm
afraid Mr. Simon Matic

30:54.886 --> 30:57.890
will disappear into thin air.

31:05.330 --> 31:09.142
I read the preliminary report--
it was a good shooting.

31:19.010 --> 31:22.150
Susan: I don't want him out of jail either.

31:22.180 --> 31:24.182
I never saw their faces.

31:25.517 --> 31:29.192
I opened the door, they sprayed
something in my eyes.

31:31.022 --> 31:33.662
They did the same thing to Sarah and Maggie.

31:33.692 --> 31:35.672
The place where they kept you...?

31:35.694 --> 31:37.765
They took us down some stairs...

31:37.796 --> 31:40.003
It was damp.

31:40.031 --> 31:42.841
Where did they release you?

31:42.868 --> 31:45.542
At a rest stop on the thruway.

31:47.038 --> 31:49.348
They put us in the bathroom,

31:49.374 --> 31:51.854
blindfolded, tied up.

31:51.877 --> 31:54.687
After a while, Melvyn, Lucas' father,

31:54.713 --> 31:56.317
came and got us.

31:56.348 --> 31:59.022
Maggie was alone with him,

31:59.050 --> 32:01.394
isn't that right?

32:04.322 --> 32:06.063
Yes.

32:08.493 --> 32:10.268
Has she talked to you about it?

32:12.330 --> 32:14.310
No.

32:14.332 --> 32:16.312
She won't talk to anyone,

32:16.334 --> 32:18.371
not even her sister.

32:20.172 --> 32:22.174
We took her to a therapist.

32:23.375 --> 32:27.482
He said that Maggie
identifies with her captor.

32:27.512 --> 32:31.756
Itâ€™s what happens with hostages.

32:36.021 --> 32:37.659
Stockholm Syndrome.

32:37.689 --> 32:39.999
She just sits there.

32:40.025 --> 32:43.006
She won't say a word. She doesn't even cry.

32:43.028 --> 32:46.566
She's just so full of rage.

32:49.534 --> 32:52.174
We're gonna have to talk to Maggie,

32:52.204 --> 32:54.343
with your permission, of course.

32:54.372 --> 32:57.353
No. She doesn't want to talk about it.

32:57.375 --> 32:59.355
- I won't force her.
- Lucas.

32:59.377 --> 33:01.618
Susan, there'll be a trial.

33:01.646 --> 33:04.126
She'll have to testify.
She'll have to face him.

33:04.149 --> 33:07.653
- I won't put her through that.
- It's not up to you, Lucas.

33:12.991 --> 33:15.995
All you have to do is answer their questions.

33:17.496 --> 33:21.308
It's important, not just for them...

33:22.300 --> 33:24.041
But for you and Sarah.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.511
Please, sweetheart.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.510
Just try.

33:41.186 --> 33:43.029
I'm gonna close the door.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.701
I'm Alex.

33:53.198 --> 33:55.678
What we need, Maggie,
is to see if you can identify

33:55.700 --> 33:58.010
the men who kidnapped you.

33:58.036 --> 34:00.209
We don't need to go into what happened

34:00.238 --> 34:02.275
or what they did.

34:02.307 --> 34:04.287
I'll start by showing you photos,

34:04.309 --> 34:07.313
and you tell me if you recognize anybody.

34:12.650 --> 34:14.494
I didn't see their faces.

34:15.987 --> 34:18.297
Maybe you noticed a physical detail--

34:18.322 --> 34:20.360
the color of their hair, a birthmark?

34:20.391 --> 34:21.768
I don't know. I don't remember.

34:22.761 --> 34:25.536
Eames: Maggie, I understand youâ€™re angry.

34:26.531 --> 34:28.533
You feel everybody abandoned you,

34:28.567 --> 34:31.138
that they didn't take care of you.

34:31.168 --> 34:33.842
You're right, they didn't.

34:35.507 --> 34:37.817
We can't make everything right for you,

34:37.842 --> 34:39.822
youâ€™re the only one who can do that.

34:39.844 --> 34:41.687
Oh, come on.

34:42.981 --> 34:45.928
That's the same crap she hears
from her therapist.

34:45.951 --> 34:47.987
She's not a little girl.

34:48.018 --> 34:50.021
She wants to talk, sheâ€™ll talk.

34:51.255 --> 34:52.563
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

34:52.591 --> 34:56.232
One of the men who kidnapped you?
Well, he's dead.

34:56.261 --> 34:58.673
He pulled a gun on Detective Eames,

34:58.697 --> 35:01.610
she shot him.
(mimics gunshot)

35:08.473 --> 35:10.316
This one.

35:20.151 --> 35:22.654
What's the matter? You feel bad for him?

35:24.823 --> 35:27.360
Well, anyway, he's not the boss.

35:27.392 --> 35:29.235
Him, we have in custody.

35:36.835 --> 35:40.840
You'd never think by looking at him
he's a sadistic monster,

35:40.872 --> 35:44.342
a man with no soul.
He's just the worst kind of evil.

35:51.182 --> 35:54.857
He was in the Serbian Army
during the war in Bosnia.

35:56.521 --> 35:58.694
You probably read about that in school.

36:02.961 --> 36:04.963
Him and his buddies?

36:07.132 --> 36:09.703
They raped thousands of women and...

36:09.734 --> 36:11.839
Girls.

36:12.971 --> 36:15.315
Raped, raped,

36:15.340 --> 36:18.287
raped, raped,

36:18.309 --> 36:21.813
raped, raped.

36:27.152 --> 36:31.658
Now he makes a living kidnapping
the families of people who owe money.

36:34.325 --> 36:37.067
He was about to kidnap another girl

36:37.095 --> 36:38.631
when we arrested him.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.503
She's 14 years old.

36:47.338 --> 36:50.319
Eames: He's a bad guy, Maggie.

36:50.341 --> 36:53.584
He's a coward, he's a weakling, right?

36:53.611 --> 36:56.285
Maybe they're the weaklings.

37:02.120 --> 37:03.656
The victims?

37:03.688 --> 37:06.669
No. No, this guy's a sadist.
He likes to hurt people.

37:06.691 --> 37:09.331
Maybe he just knows what he wants
and goes after it!

37:12.630 --> 37:15.201
Maybe he's just stronger than everybody else!

37:16.234 --> 37:18.942
- Nobody pushes him around, right?
- Yes.

37:18.970 --> 37:20.608
- You like that about him?
- Yes.

37:21.606 --> 37:24.712
- You want to be strong too, so
nobody pushes you around?
- Yes.

37:24.743 --> 37:28.122
You don't want to feel weak...
like these girls,

37:28.146 --> 37:30.490
- you don't want to be a victim?
- No.

37:30.515 --> 37:33.223
You don't want to feel helpless
like you did when...

37:34.219 --> 37:35.721
He raped you,

37:35.754 --> 37:38.166
when you couldn't defend yourself?

37:38.189 --> 37:40.260
No.

37:42.927 --> 37:45.168
You don't ever want to feel
that way again, do you, Maggie?

37:45.196 --> 37:47.005
No.

37:48.533 --> 37:50.809
Oh my God.

37:55.340 --> 37:57.650
He hurt me.

37:57.675 --> 38:00.451
He hurt me so bad.

38:01.946 --> 38:05.086
You're not weak, you're strong.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.620
You lived through it.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.298
Sorry we're late.

38:16.327 --> 38:20.241
Shouldn't you be getting him ready for
transport to the courthouse for arraignment?

38:20.265 --> 38:22.074
We just have to dot some I's for the DA.

38:22.100 --> 38:24.137
First thing, does he want to make a statement?

38:24.169 --> 38:26.979
No, he doesn't.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.779
Your name is Simon Matic,

38:30.809 --> 38:32.982
Naturalized US citizen 1998?

38:35.046 --> 38:36.957
Yes.

38:36.981 --> 38:40.485
You served in the Serbian Army
from '89 to '93?

38:44.656 --> 38:47.000
It's just for identification purposes.

38:51.996 --> 38:53.976
Yes, I serve.

38:53.998 --> 38:57.070
- Doing what, motor pool?
- Infantry.

38:57.101 --> 39:00.412
But what, stocking the selves in the PX...

39:00.438 --> 39:02.440
Typing letters?

39:06.144 --> 39:09.125
I just don't see you going
anywhere near the shooting.

39:09.147 --> 39:11.718
I fought for my country.

39:12.784 --> 39:14.957
There's fighting and then there's fighting.

39:16.487 --> 39:19.434
- I was wounded.
- Right.

39:19.457 --> 39:21.300
Everybody wants to be a war hero.

39:21.326 --> 39:24.637
- You want to see?
- Let's not get into a pissing match.

39:24.662 --> 39:27.768
I'll take your word for it--
you're a hero of the Serbian people.

39:27.799 --> 39:29.574
No, no, no.

39:29.601 --> 39:32.980
My friend, you think I am... coward.

39:33.004 --> 39:35.280
I don't mind showing you.

39:35.306 --> 39:37.445
I'm game. Let's see it.

39:45.316 --> 39:47.455
That's quite a scar. How did you get it?

39:47.485 --> 39:49.260
Shrapnel.

39:52.957 --> 39:54.698
What do you have back there?

39:56.661 --> 39:59.267
- It is nothing.
- You've got ink.

40:02.333 --> 40:04.006
Can I see?

40:06.004 --> 40:07.950
It's a tiger's head.

40:07.972 --> 40:10.578
And there are dates-- '89 to '93.

40:10.608 --> 40:12.986
Your tour in the Serbian Army.

40:13.011 --> 40:15.651
What are those initials?

40:15.680 --> 40:18.718
Serbian Infantry Regiment.

40:18.750 --> 40:21.094
You sure?

40:23.087 --> 40:24.896
"S.D.G."?

40:25.924 --> 40:29.667
Doesn't that stand for
Srpska Dobrovoljacka Garda?

40:33.865 --> 40:36.641
The Serbian volunteer guard?

40:36.668 --> 40:40.616
You weren't regular army, were you?

40:42.573 --> 40:44.348
You were in a paramilitary group,

40:44.375 --> 40:46.878
under the command
of an indicted war criminal.

40:46.911 --> 40:50.324
That's it. You have gone beyond
the scope of what you're allowed to ask.

40:50.348 --> 40:53.522
Relax, Counselor. No one's after him
for war crimes, we checked.

40:53.551 --> 40:57.465
You called yourselves "The Tigers,"
because you were...

40:57.488 --> 40:59.297
Ferocious?!

40:59.324 --> 41:02.931
- Especially with unarmed civilians?
- That is not true.

41:02.961 --> 41:07.432
You probably got that scar from
some poor woman you raped who stuck
her paring knife into you.

41:07.465 --> 41:10.105
That is lies. Those bitches,

41:10.134 --> 41:12.580
they are all liars.

41:17.008 --> 41:18.749
(sighs)

41:26.351 --> 41:28.957
You know how I know so much about your tattoo?

41:35.693 --> 41:37.536
I've seen it before.

41:41.699 --> 41:43.610
Somebody drew this from memory.

41:45.036 --> 41:47.175
The dates, the letters,

41:47.205 --> 41:49.685
all the way down to the tiger's stripes.

41:49.707 --> 41:51.709
She got every detail right.

41:54.379 --> 41:56.086
You see this?

41:56.114 --> 41:58.219
It's her signature.

41:59.884 --> 42:01.830
Read it. Want me to help you?

42:03.321 --> 42:05.801
It's signed Maggie Colter.

42:12.997 --> 42:16.877
And this, my friend, this is a positive ID.

42:23.341 --> 42:27.084
You raped her body, you raped her-- her mind.

42:27.111 --> 42:29.148
You turned her head inside out.

42:29.180 --> 42:30.887
But she got you.

42:32.016 --> 42:34.690
She got you.

42:36.687 --> 42:38.689
Didn't she?

42:52.203 --> 42:54.843
Now he's ready for arraignment.

43:12.657 --> 43:14.659
That's a tough little girl.
