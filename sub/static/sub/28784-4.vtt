(mailbox unlocks)

00:09.000 --> 00:11.040
*

00:31.230 --> 00:33.230
*

00:44.610 --> 00:46.640
(cheering and applause)

00:50.410 --> 00:54.020
TAMMY:
Hello, Sedona!

00:54.050 --> 00:56.320
Hello.

00:56.350 --> 00:59.620
Oh, my God.
The sunsets out here.

00:59.660 --> 01:01.060
(chuckles)

01:01.090 --> 01:04.160
Oh, are they gorgeous or what?

01:04.190 --> 01:07.200
Okay, let's get to it.

01:07.230 --> 01:09.200
This evening,
we're going to start

01:09.230 --> 01:11.330
with what we know is real.

01:11.370 --> 01:13.340
The present.

01:13.370 --> 01:15.070
The now.

01:15.100 --> 01:17.170
I want you
to take a deep breath

01:17.210 --> 01:18.440
and say to yourself,

01:18.470 --> 01:22.880
"I am in the now."

01:22.910 --> 01:26.010
Do it. Let's say it together.

01:26.050 --> 01:28.750
-I am in the now.
-CHIP: I am in

01:28.780 --> 01:31.390
-the now.
-TAMMY: Good.

01:31.420 --> 01:33.190
That's how I start
every morning.

01:33.220 --> 01:36.760
I look in the mirror.
I say hi to myself.

01:36.790 --> 01:40.030
You do it. Say hi to yourself.

01:40.060 --> 01:42.060
-Hi.
-This is your best friend.

01:42.100 --> 01:43.570
I touch the mirror.

01:43.600 --> 01:46.300
(laughs):
Yes, I touch myself.

01:46.340 --> 01:47.600
-(laughter)
-Yeah.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.270
I tell myself,

01:49.310 --> 01:52.580
"You are
my number one priority."

01:52.610 --> 01:54.380
You do it. Tell yourself,

01:54.410 --> 01:56.040
"You are
my number one priority."

01:56.080 --> 01:58.710
You are my number one priority.

01:58.750 --> 01:59.920
TAMMY:
"I love you."

01:59.950 --> 02:01.620
Do it. Say it.

02:01.650 --> 02:04.120
-Say to yourself, "I love you."
-Uh...

02:04.150 --> 02:05.390
-(door opens)
-Oh, shit.

02:05.420 --> 02:07.960
-Oh! Oh, God. Sorry.
-Mom!

02:07.990 --> 02:09.759
How did you get in here?

02:09.789 --> 02:12.560
Well, I've got a key, honey.
I bought this place.

02:12.600 --> 02:15.130
(sighs) Well, knock.

02:15.160 --> 02:17.530
How do you like this outfit?

02:17.570 --> 02:19.540
Looks beautiful.

02:19.570 --> 02:21.670
-It's nice. I...
-Are you gonna be long?

02:21.700 --> 02:23.410
No, Mother.
I'm not gonna be much longer.

02:23.440 --> 02:25.470
Take your time.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.450
(door closes)

02:29.480 --> 02:31.150
-JOAN: No.
-MAGGIE: Oh, that's terrible.

02:31.180 --> 02:33.150
-JOAN: Hi, Chip.
-MRS. BASKETS: Oh.

02:33.180 --> 02:34.450
Hey, honey.

02:34.480 --> 02:36.120
We're right in the middle
of gown shopping

02:36.150 --> 02:37.620
for the wedding.

02:37.650 --> 02:39.560
Hey, there was a sale,
and I got you something.

02:39.590 --> 02:40.990
-(Maggie laughs)
-JOAN: Whoo-hoo.

02:41.020 --> 02:42.830
Try it on.
I think you'll like it.

02:42.860 --> 02:44.090
I'll be right back, girls.

02:44.130 --> 02:45.630
-Thanks, Mom.
-JOAN/MAGGIE: Okay.

02:45.660 --> 02:47.100
-MAGGIE: Hi there.
-Hi, ladies.

02:47.130 --> 02:50.470
You know, between her place
and the rodeo and your place,

02:50.500 --> 02:52.940
Christine has a bathroom
everywhere in town.

02:52.970 --> 02:55.540
-(women laugh)
-Yeah.

02:55.570 --> 02:59.310
JOAN:
Oh, beautiful apartment, Chip.

02:59.340 --> 03:01.540
Oh, thank you.
It's actually a condo.

03:01.580 --> 03:03.280
BOTH:
Oh...

03:03.310 --> 03:05.150
-(toilet flushes)
-JOAN: Christine has been
telling us

03:05.180 --> 03:07.620
what a good little helper
you've been at the rodeo.

03:07.650 --> 03:09.050
MRS. BASKETS:
You're up, Joan.

03:09.080 --> 03:10.420
JOAN:
Oh, good.

03:10.450 --> 03:14.790
-JOAN: Whoo-hoo!
-Oh, you look so cute.

03:14.820 --> 03:18.630
Are you ready for school?
That's what it reminds me of.

03:18.660 --> 03:21.200
Oh, I miss you.
You know, that house we're in,

03:21.230 --> 03:23.500
it's so big and lonesome.

03:23.530 --> 03:26.840
Why don't we all get together
for dinner on Sunday?

03:26.870 --> 03:29.570
We'll go to that Chinese place
by the Crystal Palace.

03:29.610 --> 03:32.280
I'll look at my work schedule.
Maybe I can pencil something in.

03:32.310 --> 03:33.980
-MRS. BASKETS:
I think it would be so much fun.
-Yeah.

03:34.010 --> 03:36.650
Remember all the dinners
we used to have?

03:36.680 --> 03:39.850
-We never went to dinners.
-Well, we wanted to.

03:39.880 --> 03:41.520
-Your turn.
-Oh, good.

03:41.550 --> 03:43.520
Oh. How 'bout those knobs?

03:43.550 --> 03:45.650
Oh, my God, they were gorgeous.

03:45.690 --> 03:48.560
-You just passing through?
-MRS. BASKETS: Maggie! Let's go.

03:48.590 --> 03:50.630
Big Gowns is gonna close.

03:50.660 --> 03:52.500
-Honey, there's no TP in there.
-Oh, my God.

03:52.530 --> 03:54.330
Oh, God, you'll have to go
over there.

03:54.360 --> 03:55.760
-I cannot miss this place.
-Bye, Chip.

03:55.800 --> 03:56.930
-It's my favorite.
-Let's go. Bye, honey.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.130
Bye, honey.

03:58.170 --> 03:59.900
Bye, Mom.
Thanks for stopping by

03:59.940 --> 04:01.570
-and using my toilet.
-(door closes)

04:02.670 --> 04:03.940
-Sarah!
-Mom...

04:03.970 --> 04:05.540
(tires screech)

04:05.570 --> 04:07.680
Hey, princess, come on.

04:07.710 --> 04:09.650
I'm talking to my daughter,
Nicole, not you.

04:09.680 --> 04:11.850
You can just push
that copper tubing to the side.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.380
-Yep, like that.
-Dale,

04:13.420 --> 04:15.520
Sarah's failed her last two
history exams.

04:15.550 --> 04:17.820
Well, who cares? I mean,
the California school system,

04:17.850 --> 04:20.160
all they teach you about is that
we came from chimpanzees,

04:20.190 --> 04:21.860
and about sharing.

04:21.890 --> 04:24.330
I'll learn her.
I'll make sure she's learned.

04:24.360 --> 04:26.660
Right, Sarah?

04:26.700 --> 04:29.670
Uh, can we just go?

04:29.700 --> 04:31.700
-We're gonna go.
-It's that phone.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.070
If she didn't spend so much time

04:33.100 --> 04:34.200
taking pictures of herself
on it...

04:34.240 --> 04:35.300
I am not always taking
pictures of myself.

04:35.340 --> 04:37.340
Mom's just being a total bitch.

04:37.370 --> 04:39.270
-Do not talk to me like that.
-Yeah, well,

04:39.310 --> 04:40.380
I'm living with Dad now, so you

04:40.410 --> 04:41.440
-can't tell me what to do.
-Ooh.

04:41.480 --> 04:44.110
-I'm done.
-Emojis are just popular now.

04:44.150 --> 04:45.750
You have to live with it.
Hey, sweetie.

04:45.780 --> 04:47.620
You want to come live
with Daddy, too?

04:47.650 --> 04:49.080
No.

04:49.120 --> 04:51.420
(mutters quietly)

04:51.450 --> 04:54.590
The youngest is always
the most disappointing.

04:54.620 --> 04:56.930
(over radio):
* I drink one for my baby *

04:56.960 --> 04:58.460
* Who is long gone... *

04:58.490 --> 05:00.430
DALE:
Uh, the guy that lives
in that RV right there,

05:00.460 --> 05:01.760
-his name is Walter Scruggs.
-(bicycle bell dings)

05:01.800 --> 05:04.400
He's a very interesting man.

05:04.430 --> 05:07.870
And, uh, that's our place
right there.

05:07.900 --> 05:10.210
That's our RV.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.810
Are we in a trailer park?

05:11.840 --> 05:16.750
Uh... well, that's one way
of looking at it, yes.

05:16.780 --> 05:18.250
Great.

05:18.280 --> 05:19.650
Well, I'd love to show you
the place.

05:19.680 --> 05:21.250
It smells just like Febreze,
so you'll love it.

05:21.280 --> 05:22.420
Come on in.

05:25.890 --> 05:27.260
(light switch clicking)

05:27.290 --> 05:29.020
Dad, the lights don't even work.

05:29.060 --> 05:30.390
-(generator sputtering)
-Hold on.

05:30.430 --> 05:33.760
I run my lights on clean,
off-the-grid diesel.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.500
-(generator starts)
-They on?

05:40.740 --> 05:42.100
Yeah.

05:42.140 --> 05:44.470
Pretty cool space in there,
isn't it?

05:44.510 --> 05:46.740
Yeah, pretty cool.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.610
TAMMY:
You know the voice that
plays inside your head--

05:48.640 --> 05:50.450
what you like,
what you dislike?

05:50.480 --> 05:52.250
Where do you think
that voice came from?

05:52.280 --> 05:54.750
Is it really you,
or is it your mom?

05:54.780 --> 05:56.590
Or it could be
your sister or brother.

05:56.620 --> 05:59.890
It could be you but
when you were nine years old.

05:59.920 --> 06:02.460
Now, would you take advice
from a nine-year-old?

06:02.490 --> 06:03.860
(grunts)

06:03.890 --> 06:05.990
These voices make a map.
Go left, go right.

06:06.030 --> 06:08.600
Avoid this situation,
take that situation.

06:08.630 --> 06:11.900
-But it's not even your map.
-(blows raspberry)

06:11.930 --> 06:15.070
So what we're going to do is
we're going to build a new you,

06:15.100 --> 06:18.710
a new map, by bringing all
of you into the present.

06:18.740 --> 06:20.380
No more voices from the past.

06:20.410 --> 06:21.680
We're gonna go a different way.

06:21.710 --> 06:23.380
(phone ringing)

06:23.410 --> 06:25.250
Oh, hey, Chrysanthemum.

06:29.250 --> 06:31.350
-Gosh. Hey, Martha.
-Hey, Chip.

06:31.390 --> 06:32.960
Um, could I ask you
a question?

06:32.990 --> 06:37.130
-How would you describe me?
-Hmm.

06:37.160 --> 06:42.160
Uh, male, white...
uh, swarthy.

06:42.200 --> 06:44.200
About five-two.

06:44.230 --> 06:46.000
-Five-two?
-Yeah.

06:46.030 --> 06:47.900
Martha, I'm five-eight
and a quarter.

06:47.940 --> 06:50.370
My God,
get your eyesight checked.

06:50.410 --> 06:53.340
I don't mean physically,
I mean, like...

06:53.380 --> 06:55.840
what is the energy
that I put out there?

06:55.880 --> 06:59.350
Oh, you're listening to Tammy's
Live in Sedona, aren't you?

06:59.380 --> 07:01.720
-You're doing the friend quiz.
-No.

07:01.750 --> 07:05.190
Maybe. Yes.
Yes, I am doing that.

07:05.220 --> 07:07.060
Okay, Chip Baskets.

07:07.090 --> 07:09.960
Um, he's a clown.

07:09.990 --> 07:13.100
A clown with a condo.

07:13.130 --> 07:15.360
Um, you're really good at
helping people.

07:15.400 --> 07:19.740
Like your mom, and that couple
with a baby, and me.

07:19.770 --> 07:22.610
-A helper. So I'm a helper?
-Yeah.

07:22.640 --> 07:24.440
That's it?
I just help people?

07:24.470 --> 07:28.210
Like that glove on television
that helps hamburgers. Great.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.580
Yeah, well, Hamburger Helper
has helped

07:30.610 --> 07:32.880
-a lot of moms make dinner.
-(scoffs)

07:32.920 --> 07:34.620
I don't know what
you want me to say.

07:34.650 --> 07:36.750
-Who do you think you are?
-I guess I'm just misunderstood,
that's all.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.950
-Thanks.
-Okay, well...

07:38.990 --> 07:40.790
(quietly):
Excuse me.

07:40.820 --> 07:42.320
Thanks for coming by.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.430
-(barking)
-God, I hate dogs.

07:49.460 --> 07:51.430
Any animal, any kind
of animals-- where was I?

07:51.470 --> 07:52.970
Oh, yeah, I was telling you,

07:53.000 --> 07:56.340
I control the, the Wi-Fi modem
here at the RV park,

07:56.370 --> 07:58.770
so it kind of makes me
the king of the park,

07:58.810 --> 08:01.440
and you would be my,
my princess-- hey, guys.

08:01.480 --> 08:03.150
Please don't call me "princess."

08:03.180 --> 08:04.610
These are some of my friends

08:04.650 --> 08:06.150
that I do a lot
of my fellowshipping with.

08:06.180 --> 08:07.250
Uh, this is Sarah.

08:07.280 --> 08:09.280
-Hi.
-WALLIS: Wow. Nice work, Dale.

08:09.320 --> 08:10.750
Nice work.

08:10.790 --> 08:13.260
-Oh, my God.
-Wallis, she's my daughter.

08:13.290 --> 08:16.490
I know. Nice work parenting,
whatnot.

08:16.530 --> 08:19.390
(sighs) And, uh, right here,
this is Duane.

08:19.430 --> 08:21.330
He's got a Facebook Live page
about the end of the world.

08:21.360 --> 08:23.400
-It's really interesting stuff.
-Cool.

08:23.430 --> 08:24.970
DUANE:
Chinese are gonna flood it.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.430
Whole thing's gonna be a beach.

08:26.470 --> 08:29.470
Dead fish flopping
all over. Menthol?

08:29.500 --> 08:31.140
Uh, I don't smoke.

08:31.170 --> 08:32.580
Well, don't poo-poo it.

08:32.610 --> 08:33.980
It works out for some women.

08:34.010 --> 08:35.710
Keeps 'em thin.

08:35.740 --> 08:38.309
Cool rabbit.

08:38.350 --> 08:40.520
-Uh, does it have a name?
-Dinner.

08:40.549 --> 08:43.090
-(mouths)
-WALLY JR.: You want to see
something even cooler?

08:43.120 --> 08:45.820
WALLIS:
Oh, this is my boy, Wally Jr.

08:45.850 --> 08:47.920
Hi. I'm-I'm Sarah.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.130
-WALLY JR.: Hey.
-Uh, who's this?

08:50.160 --> 08:52.290
-Uh, this is Sally Sue.
You want to hold her?
-(chuckles): Hi.

08:52.330 --> 08:54.500
-Can I?
-Yeah. She'll make a little bit
of noise-- she's fine.

08:54.530 --> 08:55.900
-Oh, my gosh.
-She's fine.

08:55.930 --> 08:57.330
Yeah, just like that.
That's perfect.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.470
-(laughs) Hi.
-(shushing)

08:59.500 --> 09:01.300
(whispers):
It's okay. It's okay.

09:01.340 --> 09:03.510
Um, can you take
a picture of me?

09:03.540 --> 09:05.370
-Oh, yeah. Of course.
-Thanks.

09:05.410 --> 09:07.410
(camera clicking)

09:10.080 --> 09:11.880
-Let me see that. Is that nice?
-Yeah.

09:11.910 --> 09:14.220
-Oh, look at that.
-Oh, it...

09:14.250 --> 09:16.050
What the hell?

09:16.080 --> 09:18.490
-No kissy-face pictures
with my daughter!
-Dad!

09:18.520 --> 09:20.160
-Oh, my God.
-Okay?

09:20.190 --> 09:22.160
Keep an eye on your son.

09:22.190 --> 09:24.190
All right.

09:25.730 --> 09:28.200
-SARAH: Oh, God. Bye.
-Bye.

09:28.230 --> 09:31.470
TAMMY:
Never forget that you exist
in the now.

09:31.500 --> 09:34.670
So I want you to call all of
yourself back into the present,

09:34.700 --> 09:37.570
from all the places
you've left yourself behind.

09:37.610 --> 09:39.570
Now say hello to yourself.

09:39.610 --> 09:42.010
This is really you.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.610
Hello.

09:43.650 --> 09:45.810
And you're not
going to do it alone.

09:45.850 --> 09:47.850
You know I'm doing it with you.

09:47.880 --> 09:49.820
So everyone say it with me.

09:49.850 --> 09:52.590
I'm the biggest me
that I can be.

09:52.620 --> 09:54.560
I'm the biggest me

09:54.590 --> 09:56.930
-that I can be.
-I'm the biggest me
that I can...

09:56.960 --> 09:59.860
Can I help you? Whoa, okay.
No, no, no, no.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.200
Don't touch it. Don't touch it.
You'll make it worse.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.100
Is there something
I can help you with today?

10:06.130 --> 10:09.400
Uh, yes, I am looking
for some clothes

10:09.440 --> 10:13.310
that'll make me look
like a... like a real man.

10:13.340 --> 10:15.440
Great. Great.

10:15.480 --> 10:18.080
Well, we should get out of
the children's department, then.

10:18.110 --> 10:19.550
Follow me.

10:25.650 --> 10:27.460
Okay, history lesson.

10:27.490 --> 10:29.620
How did America win
the Revolution?

10:29.660 --> 10:31.790
SARAH:
I don't know, Dad. How?

10:31.830 --> 10:35.600
Guns! America's greatest export.

10:35.630 --> 10:37.300
Oh, yeah, guns.
Guns have gotten us

10:37.330 --> 10:39.400
out of a lot of trouble here.

10:39.430 --> 10:42.600
World War II, we used guns.
Korea, guns. Vietnam, guns.

10:42.640 --> 10:45.440
Uh, Super Bowl XIII, guns.
Feel that.

10:45.470 --> 10:47.440
-Feel it. Pick it up.
-I...

10:47.480 --> 10:49.880
(exhales)
Okay.

10:49.910 --> 10:51.680
Ta-da.

10:51.710 --> 10:54.450
You look cool as shit with that
in your arms. Do it again.

10:54.480 --> 10:55.980
Pick it up.

10:56.020 --> 10:57.820
There you go-- well,
there's no bullets in it,

10:57.850 --> 11:00.220
but don't point it at any...
don't ever point it at anybody.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.590
-(gun drops on table)
-Okay? Now,

11:02.620 --> 11:06.630
first thing we need to do
is fieldstrip this thing, so...

11:06.660 --> 11:10.700
let me just, uh, take this out.
There we go.

11:10.730 --> 11:13.640
And, uh, double-check, yeah,
there's no bullets in here.

11:13.670 --> 11:15.470
Lefty loosey, righty tighty.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.670
It's all jammed up.
Oh, hold on one second.

11:17.710 --> 11:20.010
I see what's going on here.

11:20.040 --> 11:22.410
("The Star-Spangled Banner"
playing over phone)

11:22.440 --> 11:24.410
Is that my phone?
That's my phone.

11:24.450 --> 11:26.180
Oh, it's your grandmother.
Hold on.

11:26.210 --> 11:27.780
Hey, Mom.

11:27.820 --> 11:29.280
MRS. BASKETS:
Hi, Dale. What you up to?

11:29.320 --> 11:30.620
I'm just teaching my daughter
life lessons.

11:30.650 --> 11:32.020
-Why?
-I want to take the family

11:32.050 --> 11:34.160
to that place
by the Crystal Palace.

11:34.190 --> 11:36.790
Is that the new place with the
chocolate chip fortune cookies?

11:36.830 --> 11:38.490
-Okay, we'll be there.
-See you there.

11:38.530 --> 11:40.000
Okay, bye.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.700
(whispers):
How did you do that?

11:48.740 --> 11:50.410
I looked it up, Dad,
on my phone.

11:50.440 --> 11:51.870
-Ooh. Uh...
-Give me that.

11:51.910 --> 11:53.710
SARAH:
What the hell?

11:53.740 --> 11:55.010
DALE:
I want to teach you!

11:55.040 --> 11:57.980
This is about
father-daughter bonding!

11:58.010 --> 12:00.220
Oh, my God.

12:01.250 --> 12:04.150
Goddamn it.

12:04.190 --> 12:06.350
-(bicycle bell dings)
-WALLY JR.: Hey.

12:07.860 --> 12:09.830
Uh... (chuckles)
Hey.

12:09.860 --> 12:12.060
-(gunshot)
-(birds squawk, wings flutter)

12:12.090 --> 12:14.530
(chuckles):
Turns out it was loaded.

12:14.560 --> 12:17.130
TAMMY:
As human beings,
we are uniquely equipped

12:17.170 --> 12:19.270
to take ownership
and responsibility

12:19.300 --> 12:21.700
of the life we lead.

12:21.740 --> 12:23.070
We have choice.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.510
We have free will.

12:24.540 --> 12:26.070
You might have a pet dog...

12:26.110 --> 12:27.540
CHIP:
Hi, Reverend Kwon.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.910
-Hi, Reverend Kwon. Sorry.
-Oh. Oh, hey.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.920
Hey. Chip, you are
looking really sharp.

12:32.950 --> 12:34.480
-Oh, thanks.
-Yeah.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.250
What's a church
youth conference?

12:36.280 --> 12:38.020
This is You Alive.

12:38.050 --> 12:40.090
Evangelical youths from-from
all over the Central Valley,

12:40.120 --> 12:42.120
they come here to find
a deeper fellowship with Christ.

12:42.160 --> 12:44.090
Oh, that sounds like a blast.

12:44.130 --> 12:45.660
Best three days of my life.
(laughs)

12:45.690 --> 12:47.360
H-How are ticket sales?

12:47.400 --> 12:49.660
Oh, uh, really, really good.

12:49.700 --> 12:53.600
Like, we have probably
2,000 people who have applied.

12:53.640 --> 12:56.970
-We haven't finalized all...
-Whoa, whoa, hold on a second.

12:57.010 --> 13:00.380
That sounds like something you
might need to rent an arena for.

13:02.180 --> 13:05.450
Oh. Well, we were thinking
about the Marriott.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.080
Marriott? No, no, no, no, no.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.950
Uh, Marriotts are owned
by Mormons.

13:08.980 --> 13:11.050
-I did not know that.
-This is a really good deal.

13:11.090 --> 13:12.990
-It's got Wi-Fi. It's got, uh...
-You have Wi-Fi?

13:13.020 --> 13:16.220
Yeah. Yeah.
Genderless bathrooms.

13:16.260 --> 13:18.730
Oh. Let's talk.

13:18.760 --> 13:21.300
Very good. I'll see you around.

13:30.840 --> 13:32.640
(rooster crows)

13:32.670 --> 13:34.910
Oh, smell that Spring & Renewal.

13:34.940 --> 13:37.910
Mm. That's my favorite Febreze.

13:37.950 --> 13:41.950
Oh, that was a good sleep,
wasn't it, Sar-bear?

13:41.980 --> 13:44.250
Mm. Sar?

13:44.290 --> 13:47.120
Hey, Sarah?
Let's get up, sweetheart.

13:50.790 --> 13:52.790
Sarah?

13:52.830 --> 13:56.000
*

13:56.030 --> 13:58.830
Hey! Amber Alert!

13:58.870 --> 14:00.940
Dale, what's up with the Wi-Fi?

14:00.970 --> 14:02.770
I'm in the middle
of a live feed.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.710
Well, I'm in the middle
of an Amber Alert.

14:04.740 --> 14:07.140
No Wi-Fi. No pornography
until we find my daughter.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.180
-WALLIS: I saw your daughter.
-Where?

14:09.210 --> 14:11.410
She's off playing with Wally Jr.

14:11.450 --> 14:14.050
They're messing around
in the tub.

14:14.080 --> 14:16.520
(whispers):
In the tub?

14:16.550 --> 14:18.390
Sarah!

14:19.650 --> 14:21.360
WALLY JR.:
Yeah, that's so good.

14:21.390 --> 14:23.030
-(chuckling): Yeah. Perfect.
-(laughs)

14:23.060 --> 14:25.560
-Okay, maybe put
your leg up on the...
-Oh, okay.

14:25.590 --> 14:27.630
And, like, over the shoulder
a little bit.

14:27.660 --> 14:30.070
-Yeah, perfect. That's so good.
-(camera clicking)

14:30.100 --> 14:32.130
Step away from the princess,
you pauper!

14:32.170 --> 14:35.000
Jesus! Dad, put the gun down.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.140
-Put the gun down?
Are you crazy?
-Are you crazy?

14:37.170 --> 14:39.340
-What's going on here?!
-WALLY JR.: It's just
pictures, man.

14:39.370 --> 14:41.140
-"Just pictures"? Get down!
-You know? Yeah, Instagra...

14:41.180 --> 14:43.350
-It's just Instagram.
-Get down!

14:43.380 --> 14:45.550
(panting)

14:45.580 --> 14:47.920
Dad. Dad.

14:47.950 --> 14:50.150
I don't understand all this.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.190
You're taking pictures
of my daughter.

14:52.220 --> 14:55.190
-Yeah.
-Look how scantily clad
she is, huh?

14:55.220 --> 14:57.230
DALE:
What do you think
about that, son?

14:57.260 --> 14:58.430
-SARAH: Geez.
-DALE: Huh?

14:58.460 --> 15:00.030
-Pretty good. Oh!
-Give me this phone.

15:00.060 --> 15:02.060
-This phone has caused
nothing but trouble!
-SARAH: No, no!

15:02.100 --> 15:04.070
WALLY JR.:
Whoa, what the hell, man?

15:04.100 --> 15:05.730
Shit.

15:05.770 --> 15:07.040
Goddamn it.

15:07.070 --> 15:08.770
I'm pretty sure
you can just put it

15:08.800 --> 15:10.470
in a bag of rice or something.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.370
I've heard that works.

15:12.410 --> 15:14.340
-You know what else is good
for these phones?
-No, Dad.

15:14.380 --> 15:15.540
No.

15:15.580 --> 15:17.880
(gasps)
Are you crazy?

15:17.910 --> 15:20.080
(gunfire continues)

15:22.650 --> 15:24.650
Okay. Put your clothes on.

15:24.690 --> 15:26.450
We got to go
to a Chinese restaurant.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.560
Let's go.

15:28.590 --> 15:30.390
TAMMY:
Take responsibility...

15:30.430 --> 15:33.400
Hello. I'm here for the,
uh, Baskets party.

15:33.430 --> 15:35.400
-Hey, Chip.
-Yeah.

15:35.430 --> 15:37.770
-Hey.
-Hey, Martha.

15:37.800 --> 15:40.400
-Hey.
-What are you doing here?
Do you work here?

15:40.440 --> 15:42.040
I don't. Your mom invited me.

15:42.070 --> 15:44.010
You're all dolled up.

15:44.040 --> 15:46.410
Just, uh, I don't know.
I just thought I'd put some...

15:46.440 --> 15:48.710
Oh, you're still listening
to the Tammy stuff.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.580
-I like it.
-Yeah, I mean...

15:50.610 --> 15:53.050
-it's for entertainment.
-The new Chip.

15:53.080 --> 15:55.380
You look really grown-up.

15:55.420 --> 15:57.450
Thanks. Thanks, Martha.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.850
-Well, you ready
for some Chinese food?
-Sure.

15:59.890 --> 16:01.290
How are you with chopsticks?

16:01.320 --> 16:03.360
No. Brought my own fork.

16:03.390 --> 16:05.960
Oh, is this like the lobsters
where you get to pick 'em out,

16:05.990 --> 16:08.700
-then you get to eat 'em?
-KEN: I don't think these
are for cooking.

16:08.730 --> 16:11.930
Oh, what a shame.
They look so delicious.

16:11.970 --> 16:13.740
-Monica, listen to me.
-I love them.

16:13.770 --> 16:15.270
Just make sure that it's not
the stain-repellent chemicals

16:15.300 --> 16:17.270
-that's causing the problems.
-Ah!

16:17.310 --> 16:20.280
-Ken, get off the phone.
We're gonna have dinner.
-Honey, I got to go.

16:20.310 --> 16:21.940
-Walking in to dinner.
Sorry, Christine.
-Let's go.

16:21.980 --> 16:23.610
The girls are having
a little carpet problem

16:23.650 --> 16:24.850
-they got to deal with.
-Okay.

16:24.880 --> 16:26.650
MRS. BASKETS:
Oh, Chip, Martha,

16:26.680 --> 16:28.080
you're here early.

16:28.120 --> 16:29.850
Well, time is money, Mom.

16:29.880 --> 16:31.450
-Isn't that the truth?
-Hello.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.890
Oh, thank you, Ken.

16:33.920 --> 16:35.760
-(exhales)
-KEN: Chip, like the suit.

16:35.790 --> 16:36.990
Thank you, sir.

16:37.030 --> 16:38.660
Got a new clown act
up your sleeve?

16:38.690 --> 16:40.830
Well, just, uh...

16:40.860 --> 16:44.030
MRS. BASKETS:
You know, Chip's always
dressed up in funny outfits.

16:44.070 --> 16:45.970
When he was younger,
I came home one time,

16:46.000 --> 16:48.340
and he had my bra on his head,

16:48.370 --> 16:51.340
and he was pretending
he was a praying mantis.

16:51.370 --> 16:53.380
-(chuckles)
-It was your panties on my head.

16:53.410 --> 16:55.580
-Oh.
-I'm just turning over
a new leaf. That's all.

16:55.610 --> 16:57.280
MRS. BASKETS:
Oh, honey, good for you.

16:57.310 --> 16:58.310
DALE:
Hey everybody.

16:58.350 --> 17:00.980
Oh, my businessman son.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.750
(Dale sighs)

17:02.780 --> 17:04.950
Oh, God, you're getting so tall.

17:04.990 --> 17:06.950
-You look beautiful.
-Thank you. (chuckles)

17:06.990 --> 17:10.130
-Nice monkey suit, stupid.
-(Sarah exhales)

17:10.160 --> 17:13.260
MRS. BASKETS:
I, uh, have a money question
for you, Dale.

17:13.300 --> 17:14.930
Mom, you can ask me.

17:14.960 --> 17:16.530
Honey, if I had
a clown question,

17:16.560 --> 17:19.030
I'd ask you
because that's your expertise.

17:19.069 --> 17:20.900
WAITRESS:
Hi. Do you know what
you'd like to drink?

17:20.940 --> 17:23.210
Well, we just got here.
I'm all discombobulated,

17:23.240 --> 17:26.470
and the-the menu's in...
half of it's in Chinese,

17:26.510 --> 17:29.840
so I don't know
what to do here. Mm-kay.

17:29.880 --> 17:32.250
I'm ready to order. I'm gonna
have chicken fried rice,

17:32.280 --> 17:35.220
and I'm gonna have, uh,

17:35.250 --> 17:37.350
-kung pao chicken.
-CHIP: Mom, mom, mom.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.020
-I think it's just the drinks.
-Huh?
-(cell phone buzzing)

17:39.050 --> 17:40.990
-Oh, I got ahead of myself.
-Sorry, Christine.

17:41.020 --> 17:42.660
-I have to take this.
-What?

17:42.690 --> 17:45.230
Monica.
No, no, don't sign nothing

17:45.260 --> 17:48.130
until you double-check
the inventory.

17:48.160 --> 17:49.930
-What the hell's that about?
-CHIP: What?

17:49.960 --> 17:51.700
-MRS. BASKETS: Carpet, honey.
-My God.

17:51.730 --> 17:53.740
Does he have to make
such a scene?

17:53.770 --> 17:55.100
Uncle Chip?

17:55.140 --> 17:56.570
-Yes?
-Can I borrow your phone?

17:56.600 --> 17:58.510
-For what reason?
-DALE: Don't do that.

17:58.540 --> 18:00.540
All she's gonna do is
take pictures of her titties

18:00.580 --> 18:02.040
-and put it on Twitter.
-(Mrs. Baskets gasps)
-Dad.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.910
-Well, that's the truth.
-Don't say that at the table.

18:03.950 --> 18:05.910
-You might as well
call it "Twitties."
-Oh, my God.

18:05.950 --> 18:08.080
Um, anyway, uh,
I just want his phone

18:08.120 --> 18:11.250
so I can call Mom
to tell her to pick me up.

18:11.290 --> 18:14.720
I want to go home.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.860
Call... call your mom?

18:16.890 --> 18:18.960
But I thought
you hated your mom.

18:18.990 --> 18:20.530
Yeah, well,
I want to see her again,

18:20.560 --> 18:23.000
and... you know what?
She's not insane

18:23.030 --> 18:26.100
-and living in a trailer park.
-It is not a trailer park.

18:26.130 --> 18:28.400
-I told you that. Those are
good Americans living there.
-Dale. (shushes)

18:28.440 --> 18:30.410
-Come on, you guys.
-SARAH: They tried to get me
to smoke cigarettes.

18:30.440 --> 18:32.010
-DALE: Who did?
-I'll have a Tom Collins,
please.

18:32.040 --> 18:33.580
-SARAH: You're missing
the point.
-DALE: What am I missing?

18:33.610 --> 18:35.440
-I-I'm not missing
anything. Do you know what?
-Sir, do you...

18:35.480 --> 18:37.280
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna have a hamburger

18:37.310 --> 18:39.080
-with jack cheese, please.
Hold the onions.
-I'm sorr...

18:39.110 --> 18:41.380
-I'll have double the pickles.
-We don't have hamburgers here.

18:41.420 --> 18:43.750
(laughing): You don't have
hamburgers in America?

18:43.790 --> 18:45.620
It's a Chinese restaurant, Dale.

18:45.650 --> 18:47.990
Yeah, but why do I have
to kowtow to their culture?

18:48.020 --> 18:50.460
-Why is that?
-MRS. BASKETS: Just get
some moo shu, honey.

18:50.490 --> 18:52.390
-I don't want moo shu, Mom.
-You love moo shu.

18:52.430 --> 18:53.960
DALE:
I don't... I don't love moo shu.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.230
He'll have the moo shu pork.
You loved that as a kid.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.200
DALE:
I don't want any moo shu.
No moo shu.

18:58.230 --> 19:00.130
None. I don't want any moo shu.

19:00.170 --> 19:01.840
-Put down moo shu.
-I don't want moo shu.

19:01.870 --> 19:03.640
-It's the principle
of the matter.
-SARAH: Dad.

19:03.670 --> 19:06.210
I mean, at Willy's Wontons, you
can order a goddamn corn dog.

19:06.240 --> 19:08.110
-Dale.
-MRS. BASKETS: Willy's Wonton?

19:08.140 --> 19:09.380
-SARAH: Sit down.
-Dale.

19:09.410 --> 19:10.810
Oh, my God.

19:10.850 --> 19:14.550
Um, I'll have
the Grandma's Soup Noodles.

19:14.580 --> 19:17.020
Yeah, hello? Yeah, hey.

19:17.050 --> 19:18.890
Can I get a cheeseburger?
Is that possible?

19:18.920 --> 19:20.960
Hey, Dale, Dale, Dale.
Listen. Breathe.

19:20.990 --> 19:22.490
Breathe.

19:22.520 --> 19:24.430
-Wha...?
-Repeat after me.

19:24.460 --> 19:26.490
Uh, say it with me.

19:26.530 --> 19:28.230
Uh...

19:28.260 --> 19:31.170
-I am in the now.
-What are you doing?

19:31.200 --> 19:33.500
Look, you're in
the kitchen, okay?

19:33.540 --> 19:35.070
Your family's out there.

19:35.100 --> 19:37.840
We need to bring all of you
into the now.

19:37.870 --> 19:39.410
Look, I'm tired of the influx
of immigrants

19:39.440 --> 19:40.940
coming into this country
that don't know how

19:40.980 --> 19:42.480
to make a cheeseburger.
(scoffs)

19:42.510 --> 19:44.750
I mean, am I... am I crazy
for-for being like that?

19:44.780 --> 19:46.150
I think you're just
getting frustrated

19:46.180 --> 19:47.580
with your anger
at your daughter.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.020
You're taking it out
on the immigrants.

19:49.050 --> 19:51.150
Uh, I'm from Modesto.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.190
-I'm so sorry.
-Where's that?

19:53.220 --> 19:56.320
-It's up in the Bay Area.
-Look, Dale.

19:56.360 --> 19:58.830
He's, like, a San Francisco
type of guy.

19:58.860 --> 20:00.560
Dale, look.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.760
Everybody that you love is here.

20:02.800 --> 20:05.170
Just order the moo shu.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.700
Okay? Let's go have dinner.

20:06.730 --> 20:08.870
(clears throat)

20:08.900 --> 20:10.970
(sighs) Could you just
figure it out, please?

20:11.010 --> 20:12.470
Chinese cheese is fine.

20:14.710 --> 20:17.350
I'm sorry.

20:17.380 --> 20:19.450
Can you make him a burger?

20:19.480 --> 20:22.320
You got too much facial hair
to be in here.

20:31.430 --> 20:33.660
Ken, you ever been to China?

20:33.700 --> 20:35.030
No.

20:35.060 --> 20:36.700
Me, neither.

20:39.830 --> 20:41.070
(Mrs. Buckets sighs)

20:41.100 --> 20:42.970
Oh, hey.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.410
So sorry about...

20:45.440 --> 20:47.440
our family uproar.

20:51.680 --> 20:54.750
-Here you go, honey.
Call your mom.
-SARAH: Thank you.

20:56.020 --> 20:58.350
Look, I think I...

20:58.390 --> 21:01.060
I think I'm just upset,
uh, because...

21:01.090 --> 21:04.230
Sarah, I... you know,
I was excited.

21:04.260 --> 21:06.360
It's just, I'm just sad
that you're leaving.

21:06.390 --> 21:08.560
That's all. I'm just
temperamental about it. (snorts)

21:08.600 --> 21:10.930
-(sputtering sob)
-MRS. BASKETS: Well, that runs
in our family, honey.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.670
I just don't think
anybody loves me.

21:12.700 --> 21:14.740
-MRS. BASKETS: Oh, honey.
-Dad, okay...

21:14.770 --> 21:17.710
People love you.

21:17.740 --> 21:19.740
Can you hand this over to him?

21:19.770 --> 21:22.210
-MRS. BASKETS: Here, honey.
-Here, Dad.

21:22.240 --> 21:24.080
What's that?

21:24.110 --> 21:27.250
-It's for your face.
-Oh. Yes. (sniffles)

21:27.280 --> 21:29.620
(blows loudly)

21:29.650 --> 21:31.720
-(Dale whimpering)
-COOK: There you go.

21:31.750 --> 21:33.390
Happy?

21:33.420 --> 21:34.960
MRS. BASKETS:
There you go.

21:34.990 --> 21:37.220
That's love right there.

21:37.260 --> 21:39.190
That looks interesting.

21:39.230 --> 21:41.030
(Sarah gasps)

21:41.060 --> 21:43.430
Wish I would have got that now.

21:43.470 --> 21:44.900
-Hmm. It's not bad.
-(Sarah groans)

21:44.930 --> 21:46.570
-MRS. BASKETS: Oh, good.
-What's that little grin

21:46.600 --> 21:48.570
-you got on your
face there, huh?
-Sorry.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.770
MRS. BASKETS:
Hey. Don't be rude, Dale.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.770
-Now...
-I was smiling
'cause you got your burger.

21:52.810 --> 21:55.080
That's why I was smiling.
I was happy about it.

21:55.110 --> 21:56.410
MRS. BASKETS:
Show some manners.

21:56.440 --> 21:58.410
What are we, savages here?

21:58.450 --> 22:01.650
Chip, thank you
for saving dinner.

22:01.680 --> 22:04.250
-Yeah. Yes.
-Let's have a toast to Chip.

22:04.290 --> 22:05.820
-Okay.
-MRS. BASKETS: Yeah.

22:05.850 --> 22:07.420
-KEN: Chip.
-MRS. BASKETS: Toast, Dale.

22:07.460 --> 22:09.190
Toast your brother.

22:11.690 --> 22:13.660
Well, he gave you
a burger toast, honey.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.160
-I'm sorry.
-That'll work.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.930
CHIP:
Well, that was tons of fun.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.670
-MARTHA: Yeah.
-Do you mind driving me
to the rodeo?

22:19.700 --> 22:22.670
I got some contracts
that I need you to fill out.

22:22.700 --> 22:24.710
Wow, you really are five-eight.

22:24.740 --> 22:26.610
I'm five-eight and a quarter.

22:26.640 --> 22:29.540
I need to get on a flight
to Denver as soon as possible.

22:29.580 --> 22:31.650
I want you to go with me.

22:31.680 --> 22:34.280
Oh. Um...

22:34.320 --> 22:36.280
DALE:
Yeah, can I get some
ranch dressing, please?

22:36.320 --> 22:38.520
For the third time.

22:40.520 --> 22:42.490
Okay, I'll go.

22:42.520 --> 22:44.790
Thank you for the moo shu.

22:44.830 --> 22:46.360
TAMMY:
Because the truth is

22:46.390 --> 22:48.460
each and every one of you
is as special

22:48.500 --> 22:51.130
and unique
as that glorious sunset.

22:51.170 --> 22:54.500
You don't need to convince
anyone who you are.

22:54.540 --> 22:55.970
(crowd cheering)

22:56.000 --> 22:58.140
That's right.

22:58.170 --> 23:00.510
-(clattering)
-Ow!
