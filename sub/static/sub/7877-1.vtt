(upbeat March plays)

00:02.471 --> 00:05.240
¶ good morning, usa! ¶

00:05.308 --> 00:09.177
¶ I got a feeling that it's
gonna be a wonderful day ¶

00:09.245 --> 00:12.113
¶ the sun in the sky
has a smile on his face ¶

00:12.181 --> 00:16.283
¶ and he's shining a salute
to the american race ¶

00:18.354 --> 00:21.256
¶ oh, boy, it's swell to say ¶

00:21.324 --> 00:22.891
¶ good morning, usa. ¶

Dad, dad, dad!
Stan, stan!
Dad, dad!

00:37.506 --> 00:39.140
Stan, stan the man!
You'll never
believe it!

00:39.208 --> 00:40.675
I've got something
really big!
You're gonna (bleep).

00:40.743 --> 00:42.510
You're all gonna (bleep).
One at a time.

00:42.578 --> 00:44.979
<i>Stan, the new tv guide came,
and you'll never guess what--</i>

00:45.047 --> 00:46.848
<i>Barbra does celine.</i>

00:46.916 --> 00:48.717
<i>Barbra does celine!
Huh?</i>

00:48.784 --> 00:51.853
Barbra streisand will be singing
the songs of celine dion

00:51.921 --> 00:54.289
In a one-night-only,
live pay-per-view event!

00:54.357 --> 00:55.824
I don't think barbra
has the range

00:55.891 --> 00:57.192
To sing celine's songs.

00:57.259 --> 00:58.760
Shut your mouth,
you stupid bitch.

00:58.828 --> 01:00.695
So, listen, I'm going
to need all your support

01:00.763 --> 01:02.764
To make sure everything
goes smoothly for me.

01:02.832 --> 01:04.632
This could be the best night
of my life,

01:04.700 --> 01:06.234
And I don't want
to have any regrets.

01:06.302 --> 01:08.103
Like when I had the chance
to take ecstasy

01:08.170 --> 01:09.804
At the 2003 tony awards
and didn't.

01:09.872 --> 01:11.339
I should have,
but I was sitting

01:11.407 --> 01:13.341
Next to alan cummings,
and I got scared.

01:13.409 --> 01:14.743
Whatever. Hayley,
you're up.

01:14.810 --> 01:16.311
So, I think
I finally figured out

01:16.379 --> 01:18.046
Why you never want
to talk to me.

01:18.114 --> 01:19.381
Next. Somebody
go next.

01:19.448 --> 01:21.316
Dad, you know how I've
been working really hard

01:21.384 --> 01:23.952
With my a cappella group,
here comes treble?
Hmm.

01:24.019 --> 01:27.188
My music teacher selected me
to sing the national anthem

01:27.256 --> 01:29.791
At the langley falls
veterans day celebration!

01:29.859 --> 01:31.393
That's fantastic!

01:31.460 --> 01:34.562
My boy singing the
greatest song ever written

01:34.630 --> 01:38.133
To the greatest men ever
made: American soldiers.

01:38.200 --> 01:39.401
Steve, serenade me.

01:39.468 --> 01:40.769
(clears throat)

01:40.836 --> 01:42.871
(soulfully):
¶ oh-ho, ho ¶

01:42.938 --> 01:45.407
¶ say, can you ¶

01:45.474 --> 01:48.843
¶ see-hee-hee-hee, hee... ¶

01:48.911 --> 01:50.412
Steven, what the hell?

01:50.479 --> 01:52.213
<i>Did you just watch
the wiz or something?</i>

01:52.281 --> 01:54.315
I'm just putting
some personal flavor on it.

01:54.383 --> 01:55.884
Just sing it like
a normal person.

01:55.951 --> 01:57.886
¶ oh, oh, say-- ¶

01:57.953 --> 01:59.120
Okay, got it--
still sucks.

01:59.188 --> 02:00.755
I thought it was great.

02:00.823 --> 02:03.224
Have you been standing
there the whole time?

02:03.292 --> 02:04.926
That's weird.

02:04.994 --> 02:06.594
I had no idea
you were there.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.099
Anyway, steve,
it's fine,

02:11.167 --> 02:13.668
But not nearly good enough
for the ears of veterans.

02:13.736 --> 02:15.570
Tell you what, I'll take
the next couple days

02:15.638 --> 02:17.672
Off work, and we'll get
that song just right.

02:17.740 --> 02:18.773
Thanks, dad.

02:18.841 --> 02:20.175
I don't want
to mess this up.

02:20.242 --> 02:21.943
No, you really don't.

02:22.011 --> 02:24.679
Now, go upstairs and line
your throat with vaseline.

02:24.747 --> 02:26.147
Makes your voice
come out smoother.

02:26.215 --> 02:28.082
It's an old
elton john trick.

02:28.150 --> 02:29.951
(whistling joyfully)

02:32.188 --> 02:36.558
(bird twittering tune)

02:36.625 --> 02:40.728
(both whistling tune)

02:40.796 --> 02:42.697
(twittering tune)

02:42.765 --> 02:43.832
(gasps and groans)

02:43.899 --> 02:45.300
Annoying!
Both of you.

02:45.367 --> 02:46.701
I love your new pet.

02:46.769 --> 02:48.002
It's not a pet, silly.

02:48.070 --> 02:49.337
It's my meal for
the big night.

02:49.405 --> 02:50.405
(gasps) roger!

02:50.473 --> 02:52.507
You can't kill
this sweet bird.

02:52.575 --> 02:54.242
It's an ortolan, francine--

02:54.310 --> 02:56.177
The ultimate french delicacy.

02:56.245 --> 02:58.546
It so sinfully decadent
that you eat it

02:58.614 --> 03:01.316
Under a napkin
to hide your sin from god.

03:01.383 --> 03:03.384
And I only trust
you to cook it.

03:03.452 --> 03:04.419
(gasps)

03:04.487 --> 03:05.753
I'm honored.

03:05.821 --> 03:06.855
Here's the recipe.

03:06.922 --> 03:08.423
You actually drown
it in amaretto,

03:08.491 --> 03:10.458
Then save its life
using bird cpr,

03:10.526 --> 03:12.026
Then refill the pot
with crème de menthe

03:12.094 --> 03:13.428
And drown it again.

03:13.496 --> 03:15.396
There is something so sweet
about your hair today.

03:15.464 --> 03:16.598
I love it.

03:16.665 --> 03:18.299
Thank you.

03:18.367 --> 03:22.136
¶ by the dawn's
early light... ¶

03:22.204 --> 03:23.771
Stop. Take a break.

03:23.839 --> 03:25.640
I got to shake my head
in disappointment

03:25.708 --> 03:26.708
For five minutes.

03:28.310 --> 03:30.712
<i>So, stan, I tried to order
barbra does celine</i>

03:30.779 --> 03:32.180
On pay-per-view,
but it was locked.

03:32.248 --> 03:33.314
I need the code.

03:33.382 --> 03:34.549
How much is it?
It's priceless,

03:34.617 --> 03:36.384
But to order it,
it's four ninety-nine.

03:36.452 --> 03:38.853
I guess we can add
five more bucks to your tab.

03:38.921 --> 03:40.154
(laughing):
Five dollars?

03:40.222 --> 03:41.523
<i>For barbra does celine?</i>

03:41.590 --> 03:42.624
No!

03:42.691 --> 03:44.659
Oh, no, ridiculous.

03:44.727 --> 03:46.828
No, four hundred
and ninety-nine dollars.

03:46.896 --> 03:49.264
Streisand comes expensive
or she doesn't come at all.

03:49.331 --> 03:50.798
Forget it!

03:50.866 --> 03:52.867
<i>I wouldn't pay that much
to see barbra do celine.</i>

03:52.935 --> 03:54.135
Or would I?

03:54.203 --> 03:55.870
Maybe if I was in the room
with them,

03:55.938 --> 03:57.071
Peeking from behind the curtain,

03:57.139 --> 03:58.840
And they didn't know
I was there.

03:58.908 --> 04:00.875
How would it appear
on my credit card bill?

04:00.943 --> 04:02.176
No, no, stan, focus.

04:02.244 --> 04:03.411
Here's the deal.

04:03.479 --> 04:05.513
You and I both know
I'm going to get

04:05.581 --> 04:07.749
That pay-per-view code
one way or another,

04:07.816 --> 04:10.084
So you might as well
just give it to me now

04:10.152 --> 04:12.220
And avoid happy hour
at shenanigans.

04:12.288 --> 04:13.788
No.
Fine.

04:13.856 --> 04:15.089
Let it begin.

04:15.157 --> 04:17.058
Crab walk!

04:17.125 --> 04:18.860
Should've played ball.

04:20.396 --> 04:23.264
Steve:
¶ the rockets' red glare ¶

04:23.332 --> 04:24.332
No!

04:24.400 --> 04:26.034
I've been in the shower
all night.

04:26.101 --> 04:27.735
Yeah, I don't get it--
I thought people

04:27.803 --> 04:29.370
Were supposed to sing
better in the shower.

04:29.438 --> 04:30.471
I don't know.

04:30.539 --> 04:31.806
Maybe the problem
isn't you.

04:31.874 --> 04:34.642
Maybe... Maybe I'm not
a great vocal coach.

04:34.710 --> 04:36.010
God, could that be?

04:36.078 --> 04:37.612
No, dad, it's me.

04:37.680 --> 04:39.414
I just need
to sing harder.

04:39.481 --> 04:40.848
No, it's more
than that.

04:40.916 --> 04:42.250
There something
missing,

04:42.318 --> 04:45.253
Something empty and soulless
about your performance.

04:45.321 --> 04:46.688
Hmm.

04:46.755 --> 04:48.022
(snaps fingers)
that's it.

04:48.090 --> 04:50.458
See, steve, the national
anthem is about war,

04:50.526 --> 04:52.093
And you'll never
be able to sing it

04:52.161 --> 04:53.661
Until you've
been to war.

04:53.729 --> 04:55.096
Can you expand
on that idea?

04:55.164 --> 04:56.297
Certainly.

04:56.365 --> 04:57.832
Take the song,
"love in a elevator."

04:57.900 --> 04:59.133
The reason
it's so good

04:59.201 --> 05:00.802
Is because steven
tyler actually lived

05:00.869 --> 05:02.503
In an elevator the
summer he wrote it.

05:02.571 --> 05:04.205
<i>But the song's called
"love in an elevator",</i>

05:04.273 --> 05:05.607
<i>Not "live
in an elevator".</i>

05:05.674 --> 05:08.009
Steve, he's a rock star
living in kick-ass elevator.

05:08.077 --> 05:09.310
You don't think
he's getting laid?

05:09.378 --> 05:11.245
Oh, and it's
summertime.

05:13.882 --> 05:15.383
Some of my
nra buddies

05:15.451 --> 05:17.118
Rent this golf
course once a month.

05:17.186 --> 05:18.953
Since you can't
go to a real war,

05:19.021 --> 05:20.788
A reenactment is the
next best thing.

05:20.856 --> 05:23.424
I've always wanted to go
to a civil war reenactment.

05:23.492 --> 05:24.959
It's not a civil
war reenactment.

05:25.027 --> 05:26.294
Those things are
for historians

05:26.362 --> 05:27.595
And people who
hate blacks.

05:27.663 --> 05:29.797
These guys are
hardcore reenactors.

05:29.865 --> 05:31.432
(heavy gunfire)

05:31.500 --> 05:33.334
(explosions and gunfire)

05:36.138 --> 05:37.538
(groans)

05:37.606 --> 05:39.073
Get down!

05:39.141 --> 05:40.074
(explosion)

05:40.142 --> 05:41.843
(screams) where are we?

05:41.910 --> 05:43.645
You in vietnam, bitches!

06:10.042 --> 06:12.477
We're reenacting
the vietnam war?

06:12.545 --> 06:15.079
This chopper will take
you to base camp.

06:15.147 --> 06:16.748
(man imitating whirring
helicopter blades)

06:16.815 --> 06:17.982
Get in!

06:18.050 --> 06:19.317
(continues imitating helicopter)

06:19.385 --> 06:21.219
(gunfire)

06:22.621 --> 06:23.655
(screams)

06:28.794 --> 06:30.361
Platoon, gather round!

06:31.830 --> 06:33.565
The vietcong may be making
their move tonight.

06:33.632 --> 06:34.866
We need a watchman.

06:34.934 --> 06:36.601
Dad.
Steve will do it.

06:36.669 --> 06:38.836
We're counting on
you tonight, steve!

06:38.904 --> 06:40.838
Here, I'll even loan
you my lucky machete.

06:40.906 --> 06:42.240
A permanent marker?

06:42.308 --> 06:43.741
Use it like a knife.

06:43.809 --> 06:47.812
Leave the blade in the sheath
so it doesn't get dull.

06:47.880 --> 06:50.014
Leave the cap on so
it doesn't dry out.
(whispering):

06:53.319 --> 06:56.120
Dad, I don't know if I
can stand watch all night.

06:56.188 --> 06:58.590
You've kept me up for the past
two days practicing singing.

06:58.657 --> 07:01.426
Steve, this is an opportunity
to step up and be a hero.

07:01.493 --> 07:02.727
Then, you'll know
what it takes

07:02.795 --> 07:04.529
To really sing
our national anthem.

07:04.597 --> 07:06.364
Radio me if you
have any problems.

07:06.432 --> 07:07.632
I'll do my best, dad.

07:07.700 --> 07:09.434
I want more
than your best, steve.

07:09.501 --> 07:12.537
For once, I want you
to do fine.

07:14.707 --> 07:19.444
(fading):
¶ by the dawn's early light... ¶

07:19.511 --> 07:22.814
(louder):
¶ what so proudly... ¶

07:22.881 --> 07:23.881
(crickets chirping)

07:25.384 --> 07:27.218
(piercing scream)

07:30.389 --> 07:33.558
(sporadic gunfire,
men screaming)

07:39.765 --> 07:41.332
(sobbing)

07:41.400 --> 07:43.334
(yelling)

07:44.303 --> 07:45.703
Steve, what happened?!

07:45.771 --> 07:47.839
Man, what a letdown.

07:49.241 --> 07:51.709
You'll be killed if you go
into that jungle, man!

07:51.777 --> 07:54.145
Hey, my hand on fire?

07:54.213 --> 07:55.713
What? N-no.

07:55.781 --> 07:57.782
Good, then it's the acid.

07:57.850 --> 08:00.418
This seemed like the perfect
time to do acid.

08:00.486 --> 08:01.519
Dead.

08:01.587 --> 08:03.021
Everyone's dead!

08:04.757 --> 08:07.425
Their spirits are dancing
all around us

08:07.493 --> 08:09.694
Poppin' and lockin', mostly!

08:09.762 --> 08:11.996
Everyone calm down!

08:12.064 --> 08:14.098
I have been in
two war reenactments,

08:14.166 --> 08:16.868
And you men will be safe
if you stick with me.

08:16.935 --> 08:19.120
(screaming)

08:20.469 --> 08:21.269
No!

08:21.337 --> 08:22.305
We gotta get out of here, man.

08:22.306 --> 08:26.306
Let's just go to the snackstop
and get some real cheese, man.

08:26.307 --> 08:28.307
No, we have to save my dad.

08:28.372 --> 08:29.639
I let him down.

08:29.707 --> 08:31.241
Dad, can you hear me?

08:31.309 --> 08:33.743
Steve, it's dark and wet.

08:33.811 --> 08:35.212
There's golf carts.

08:35.279 --> 08:36.679
You have to save...

08:36.746 --> 08:38.715
(man speaking
fake vietnamese)

08:38.783 --> 08:42.152
Sounds like he's in a
holding cell at nangangbang.

08:42.220 --> 08:45.055
The caddy shack.

08:45.123 --> 08:47.290
Then that's where
we're headed.

08:47.358 --> 08:49.426
Woman:
Excuse me!

08:49.494 --> 08:52.629
Do you know where the
horizon room is?

08:52.697 --> 08:55.599
We don't know; we're
from baltimore.

Marty! It's this way!

it's this way!

09:04.108 --> 09:06.510
You're going
the wrong way!

Eh, wise guy, huh?

09:33.571 --> 09:35.172
Roger, stop!

09:35.239 --> 09:36.973
I'm never going to give you

11:36.527 --> 11:38.261
I will, for the bird.

Ugh, I'm disgusting.

Sorry, hayley, roger tricked me.

13:47.124 --> 13:49.993
Did you have fun at the
reenactment, honey?

13:50.060 --> 13:53.463
That's right, real war heroes
don't need to talk about it.

talk about all the "tang"

Steve, snap
out of it.

14:51.722 --> 14:53.756
Mr. Smith, can I speak
to you in the hallway?

14:55.993 --> 14:58.361
Your son appears to
be suffering from ptsd,

14:58.429 --> 14:59.996
Posttraumatic
stress disorder.

15:00.064 --> 15:01.431
But doctor, that's impossible.

15:01.499 --> 15:02.999
He was only in a reenactment.

15:03.067 --> 15:04.133
Oh.

15:04.201 --> 15:06.236
Then it must be ptwrsd,

15:06.303 --> 15:08.505
Posttraumatic
war reenactment stress disorder.

15:08.572 --> 15:09.806
Is that a thing?

15:09.874 --> 15:10.974
I've never
heard of it.

15:11.041 --> 15:12.442
I'd like keep him
here for treatment.

15:12.510 --> 15:14.210
He could be a danger
to himself or others.

15:14.278 --> 15:16.045
Nonsense!

15:16.113 --> 15:17.547
Steve?!

15:17.615 --> 15:19.115
Where'd he go?

15:19.183 --> 15:20.650
When I was out there,

15:20.718 --> 15:22.685
All I wanted to do
was come home.

15:22.753 --> 15:23.987
But now that I'm home,

15:24.054 --> 15:26.022
All I can think about
is getting back there.

15:26.090 --> 15:27.624
The golf course.

15:27.691 --> 15:30.393
Things made more sense
out there.

15:30.461 --> 15:33.029
Here sometimes
someone claims they're a friend,

15:33.097 --> 15:35.031
But they're really
just an acquaintance.

15:35.099 --> 15:37.901
And then, some friends
are really enemies.

15:37.968 --> 15:40.703
I came up
with the word "frenemy."

15:42.673 --> 15:44.073
John,

15:44.141 --> 15:45.608
How did you open the curtain?

15:47.945 --> 15:49.979
Tell me how you
opened the curtain.

15:51.315 --> 15:51.881
John!

15:54.818 --> 15:56.653
<i>...Will be right back.</i>

16:05.143 --> 16:06.477
Hey, there.

16:06.544 --> 16:08.312
The war reenactment
was yesterday.

16:08.380 --> 16:09.113
It's over.

16:09.180 --> 16:10.180
For you, maybe.

16:10.248 --> 16:11.615
Where're you headed?

16:11.683 --> 16:13.984
Just gonna get a grilled
cheese at the snack stop.

16:14.052 --> 16:15.886
I had a friend that
wanted one once.

16:15.954 --> 16:17.521
But he's gone now.

16:17.589 --> 16:19.256
To tucson.

16:19.324 --> 16:20.657
On business.

16:20.725 --> 16:23.427
Won't be back till Wednesday.

16:23.495 --> 16:25.829
I know a place down the road
with a great grilled cheese.

16:25.897 --> 16:26.997
Come on, I'll drive you.

16:27.065 --> 16:27.664
No, thanks.

16:28.833 --> 16:30.467
(golf cart chirps)

16:30.535 --> 16:32.069
I'm not looking for trouble.

16:32.137 --> 16:34.271
Get off the fairway, you turd!

16:34.339 --> 16:36.040
This is the thanks I get.

16:36.107 --> 16:37.674
A hero's welcome.

16:59.964 --> 17:01.598
Buckle couldn't

17:01.666 --> 17:04.300
We were gonna go cruising
when we got home.

17:04.368 --> 17:07.671
We were gonna go cruising

That's not it,

18:28.052 --> 18:30.854
Let-let me try and put it
in terms you can understand.

18:30.922 --> 18:33.457
Imagine being high
at a rusted root concert

18:33.525 --> 18:36.093
While two dudes take you on
in a sun-baked porta-john.

18:36.161 --> 18:37.594
Wow.

18:37.662 --> 18:39.796
That actually does
sound really good.

18:39.864 --> 18:42.065
Yeah. I'd like that, too.

18:45.970 --> 18:47.504
You're the
boy's father?

18:47.572 --> 18:50.207
Listen, guy, no one can get in
or out of here

18:50.275 --> 18:52.342
Because of that crazy kid,
and we need carts.

18:52.410 --> 18:54.912
That boy is a remorseless
reenactment machine.

18:54.979 --> 18:57.080
I know. I made him.

18:57.148 --> 18:59.683
And I'm the only one
who can get him out.

18:59.751 --> 19:01.451

I can do better.

19:17.969 --> 19:19.803
That's why I came here.

19:19.871 --> 19:22.639
It's the only place
you were ever proud of me, sir.

19:22.707 --> 19:25.442
It wasn't the war.

19:25.510 --> 19:27.244
I'm going in.

19:32.917 --> 19:34.084
Stay back!

19:34.152 --> 19:35.519
Easy, stinkfinger. Easy.

19:35.587 --> 19:37.854
It wasn't the war
that made you this way.

19:37.922 --> 19:39.122
Wh-what do you mean?

19:39.190 --> 19:40.791
Oh, steve, it was me!

19:40.858 --> 19:43.694
I pushed you too hard,
put too much pressure on you.

19:43.761 --> 19:45.862
But I only did it
because I love you

19:45.930 --> 19:47.497
And want you to succeed!

19:47.565 --> 19:49.533
But you don't need
to be pushed,

19:49.601 --> 19:51.368
'cause you're doing great
on your own.

19:51.436 --> 19:53.270
(crying)

19:56.207 --> 19:59.943
I did to you
what america did to vietnam.

20:00.011 --> 20:01.778
I tried to control you.

20:01.846 --> 20:03.413
But no longer.

20:03.481 --> 20:05.515
I'm pulling out of you, steve.

20:05.583 --> 20:07.184
I'm pulling out.

20:07.252 --> 20:09.453
I'm sorry if I hurt you, son.

20:18.696 --> 20:20.864
(fireworks pop)

20:22.300 --> 20:24.268
The celebration's
still going on.

20:24.335 --> 20:26.136
You know, you
could still sing.

20:26.204 --> 20:27.704
Am I good enough now?

20:27.772 --> 20:29.473
You were always
good enough, steve.

20:29.540 --> 20:32.142
I don't know where this low
self-esteem is coming from,

20:32.210 --> 20:34.177
But you need to start
believing in yourself.

20:34.245 --> 20:36.213
So go out there and sing.

20:36.281 --> 20:39.349
And any way you do it,
I'm gonna love it.

20:47.158 --> 20:50.727
¶ oh, say ¶

20:50.795 --> 20:54.164
¶ can you see,
by the dawn's early light? ¶

20:54.232 --> 20:57.534
¶ girl, I'm gonna rock you
in freedom town tonight ¶

20:57.602 --> 21:00.671
That's my...
Neighbor son.

21:00.738 --> 21:02.139
¶ you know
you never felt so good ¶

21:02.206 --> 21:03.874
¶ no, you never
felt so right ¶

21:03.941 --> 21:06.843
¶ ooh, rockets bursting
in the air! ¶

21:06.911 --> 21:08.745
