"How 'bout a slice of plungecake?"

00:31.906 --> 00:32.906
Humph.

00:33.199 --> 00:34.993
You're right. It's garbage.

00:35.076 --> 00:37.078
I drew bigger plungers. Better?

00:37.162 --> 00:38.162
Humph.

all the toilets were clogged!</i>

"We gotta go! It's an emergency!"</i>

"Too bad! Mua-ha-ha-ha!"</i>

02:37.740 --> 02:39.450
[yelling continues]

02:46.791 --> 02:48.561
<i>'Cause he didn't know anything
about the big game.</i>

02:48.585 --> 02:51.105
<i>Then he saw Cloggernaut and was
all like, "You're ruining the big game!"</i>

02:51.129 --> 02:55.091
<i>But he couldn't make Cloggernaut move,
like a shadow but different.</i>

Plungerina is an awesome hero.

I mean, you saw what Plungerina did
to Cloggernaut.

04:04.619 --> 04:06.621
Only 'cause Captain Underpants
teed it up for her.

04:06.704 --> 04:09.249
All I'm saying is if Cloggernaut was real,

04:09.332 --> 04:12.252
Captain Underpants
would need Plungerina to bail him out.

04:12.335 --> 04:13.461
You believe that?

04:13.544 --> 04:16.089
She just threw hero shade
at Captain Underpants!

04:16.172 --> 04:18.524
- You know what that means...
- We gotta do something really stupid

04:18.548 --> 04:21.928
like create a giant clog monster
so Captain Underpants can save the day

04:22.011 --> 04:24.371
- and prove he's better than Plungerina?
- Ding, ding, ding!

04:24.973 --> 04:27.517

If that doesn't create
a real-life Cloggernaut, nothing will.

and had a different voice.

- [Erica] That will help.

'cause those are golf shoes.
