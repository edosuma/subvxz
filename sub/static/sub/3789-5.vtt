- Hello.
- What, do you wake up at noon, Eric?

01:22.282 --> 01:24.910
It's 10:1 5. I had a late night.
What's up?

01:24.951 --> 01:27.943
You're gonna have a fabulous day.
Get up and grab "Variety."

01:27.987 --> 01:30.785
- Why? What's it say in "Variety"?
- I told you I'd get you the cover,

01:30.824 --> 01:33.486
- and I did.
- Holy shit.

01:33.526 --> 01:35.460
What's it say?

01:35.495 --> 01:37.122
Hold on.
Christy, come on.

01:37.163 --> 01:40.064
It says, "Vincent Chase
swims into 'Aquaman'."

01:40.100 --> 01:42.364
Clever, huh? And they got
his picture side by side

01:42.402 --> 01:45.462
with Jeffrey Katzenberg,
so it looks more gorgeous by comparison.

01:45.505 --> 01:48.406
- Fuck me.
- No thank you. It'd be nice

01:48.441 --> 01:51.035
- if you sent me flowers. Bye.
- How can they print that?

01:51.077 --> 01:52.305
- It's not even true.
- Come on.

01:52.345 --> 01:54.006
"Variety" is like
a high school paper.

01:54.047 --> 01:55.947
They pay their writers
28 grand a year

01:55.982 --> 01:58.576
to find out something to write
about the popular kids.

01:58.618 --> 02:01.018
What are we gonna do, Ari?
This is a big problem.

02:01.054 --> 02:03.181
First of all,
there is no "we" in "l."

02:03.223 --> 02:05.714
I am already on it.
I called Dana Gordon.

02:05.758 --> 02:07.726
You spend a lot of time
waiting to be called back.

02:07.760 --> 02:10.888
You know what? I got her her job,
so she will call me back.

02:10.930 --> 02:13.330
- What should I tell Vince?
- Until we confirm that Leo

02:13.366 --> 02:15.630
is actually doing this movie,
nothing has changed.

02:15.668 --> 02:18.068
We heard this from a fucking
club promoter named Chucky.

02:18.104 --> 02:20.834
Until we find this out from someone
who works in this business,

02:20.874 --> 02:23.570
- Vince is still Aquaman.
- You're still Vince's agent.

02:23.610 --> 02:25.441
Keep checking with me
to confirm that.

02:27.714 --> 02:31.309
Yo, E, this is Vince's first cover.
Good job, baby.

02:31.351 --> 02:35.720
E, you're en fuego. I may want you
to start managing me soon.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.125
Why haven't you asked
to manage me yet?

02:39.159 --> 02:41.354
He's waiting for your new legs
to come in, Drama.

02:41.394 --> 02:44.022
Speaking of which, you gonna give me
cash or Vincent's black card,

02:44.063 --> 02:46.088
'cause there's a couple
more things I might need.

02:46.132 --> 02:48.623
What do you want to do now,
get your ears pinned back?

02:48.668 --> 02:51.694
We need a new set of kitchen knives,
dickface. These blades are for shit.

02:51.738 --> 02:54.263
You know Vince likes
his tomatoes sliced paper thin.

02:54.307 --> 02:56.502
Oh, and, E,
Carrie Carlson called.

02:56.543 --> 02:59.808
See that rug in the living room?
She's gonna need 50K for that.

02:59.846 --> 03:02.940
I'll need a grand for a steam cleaner
'cause Arnold had a little problem.

03:02.982 --> 03:07.316
We might want to consider a permanently
installed wok. Very versatile.

03:07.353 --> 03:10.379
Guys, look, there's something important
we need to talk about.

03:10.423 --> 03:12.891
- Yo yo!
- Hey, guys.

03:12.926 --> 03:16.362
- Hey to you, neighbor.
- What happened to Cindy last night?

03:16.396 --> 03:18.887
We're hanging out, having a good time.
She just broke out.

03:18.932 --> 03:20.900
Don't worry, Turtle,
I'll find you a girl.

03:20.934 --> 03:23.027
- You promise?
- I promise.

03:23.069 --> 03:25.037
I'm gonna grab my stuff.

03:25.071 --> 03:27.437
Be right back.

03:27.473 --> 03:31.773
Hey, Vince, E's got something really
important to talk about.

03:31.811 --> 03:34.279
What's up?

03:34.314 --> 03:36.373
Nothing. I just...

03:42.989 --> 03:45.150
- Hello.
- Delivery.

03:45.191 --> 03:47.751
Hey, welcome
to the neighborhood.

03:47.794 --> 03:50.729
- Hey, Bob Saget.
- There he is.

03:50.763 --> 03:53.027
Aquaman himself.
How you doing?

03:53.066 --> 03:56.229
Been reading about you all morning, man.
I live right next door.

03:56.269 --> 03:58.237
I'm a big fan, Vince,
so are my daughters.

03:58.271 --> 04:01.832
But do me a favor, don't fuck 'em.
Don't you fuck my daughters.

04:01.874 --> 04:03.842
- I'm just fucking with you.
- Hey, Bob.

04:03.876 --> 04:06.140
- Staci, how you doing?
- Good.

04:06.179 --> 04:08.306
Is that cute little filly
Michelle in town?

04:08.348 --> 04:10.816
No, she's modeling in Dubai.
She'll be back on Saturday.

04:10.850 --> 04:12.818
- Make sure she calls me, will you?
- I will.

04:12.852 --> 04:14.513
I just got divorced.

04:14.554 --> 04:16.749
Ex-wife got the house
in the Palisades.

04:16.789 --> 04:19.916
No biggie. I got four other houses.
I don't give a shit.

04:19.959 --> 04:22.723
Well, I gotta go.
See ya.

04:22.762 --> 04:25.424
- Bye. Good to see you.
- Bye.

04:25.465 --> 04:28.059
- Bye-bye.
- Look at that gait.

04:28.101 --> 04:31.798
Who do you think is more recognizable,
you or me? Seriously.

04:31.838 --> 04:33.931
Anyway I've taken up
enough of you guys' time.

04:33.973 --> 04:37.465
Have fun. Enjoy the muffins-- handmade.
Anybody an Xbox guy?

04:37.510 --> 04:40.240
All right, I'm right next door.
Good to see you.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.908
Welcome to the neighborhood, man.
Congrats.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.416
All right.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.748
- Hey, Bob, see ya.
- See ya, man, take it easy.

04:46.786 --> 04:49.755
- Bye, dude. Take care.
- All right.

04:49.789 --> 04:52.087
- Be good.
- You too.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.218
Who the fuck was that guy?

04:54.260 --> 04:56.888
All I'm saying, Vince,
is we should have a house rule:

04:56.929 --> 04:58.897
Either we all get laid
or nobody gets laid.

04:58.931 --> 05:01.900
That way you know you'll always have
a ride home for your girl.

05:01.934 --> 05:04.164
Staci doesn't need a ride.
She's three houses down.

05:04.203 --> 05:06.296
Turtle's the one
looking for a ride.

05:06.339 --> 05:09.536
I live three doors down from the cast
of "America's Next Top Model,"

05:09.575 --> 05:12.476
and I ain't getting laid?
That's the worst cold streak ever.

05:12.512 --> 05:15.037
Turtle, a cold streak
implies that you were once hot.

05:15.081 --> 05:17.049
Go easy on him, E.
Come on.

05:17.083 --> 05:19.449
Even A-Rod goes on
a bad run sometimes.

05:19.485 --> 05:23.387
Yeah, but even when A-Rod's slumping,
he's still getting pussy.

05:23.423 --> 05:26.051
Keep fucking laughing, E.
You give me the manager title,

05:26.092 --> 05:28.253
- I'll be overflowing in it.
- Walsh!

05:29.429 --> 05:32.364
There he is,
Mr. Studio Feature.

05:33.499 --> 05:35.865
Hey, I thought
we were indie guys.

05:35.902 --> 05:38.427
Suits got you headed
for superstardom, huh?

05:38.471 --> 05:40.564
I'm just fucking around.
Cameron's great.

05:40.606 --> 05:42.574
But listen, I'm writing
something for you.

05:42.608 --> 05:45.441
- You'd better be available.
- Anything for you. You know that.

05:45.478 --> 05:49.141
You hear that, suit?
That's an oral agreement. Don't fuck me.

05:50.917 --> 05:52.851
All right,
who's ready to loop?

05:52.885 --> 05:54.580
I am.

05:54.620 --> 05:56.884
Nah, Johnny,
your sound is clean.

05:56.923 --> 05:59.084
This is Vince's day, okay?

05:59.125 --> 06:01.992
See, I project a lot
better than you, bro. Sorry.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.189
Hey, Turtle, you wanna do
a little lap around here?

06:04.230 --> 06:05.788
- Yeah.
- See you guys later.

06:05.832 --> 06:10.030
- See ya.
- So can we see a little footage?

06:10.069 --> 06:13.197
Through the glass.
No one sits in on my sessions.

06:14.574 --> 06:16.542
See now these
countertops are nice,

06:16.576 --> 06:19.170
but these cabinets are for shit.
Who would do that?

06:25.218 --> 06:27.243
Look, I'm gonna let
you have this one.

06:27.286 --> 06:30.585
Don't worry about it. Just focus,
keep your eye on the ball, all right?

06:30.623 --> 06:33.057
- All right.
- Look alive out there.

06:34.827 --> 06:37.694
Hey, honey, how you doin'?

06:40.633 --> 06:42.498
Enough's enough, man.

06:42.535 --> 06:45.971
- Who are you calling?
- Lorraine, my sure thing.

06:46.005 --> 06:47.973
She can't spell "no."

06:48.007 --> 06:50.237
I'm gonna put an end
to the streak right now.

06:50.276 --> 06:53.837
Stick it in the mailbox
once I'm gone.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.871
Let the cops
chase after a dead man.

06:58.684 --> 07:00.652
But he was your brother.

07:00.686 --> 07:03.587
Half-brother.

07:03.623 --> 07:05.648
Take care of yourself.

07:06.893 --> 07:10.590
Hey, you ever coming back?

07:10.630 --> 07:14.088
You kidding?
I am Queens Boulevard.

07:14.133 --> 07:16.226
This shit looks amazing.

07:16.269 --> 07:19.170
- This gonna be a good movie.
- Yeah, it looks real good.

07:19.205 --> 07:21.366
Hey, you ever coming back?

07:21.407 --> 07:22.874
You kidding?

07:22.909 --> 07:25.173
I am Queens Boulevard.

07:25.211 --> 07:28.544
- Listen, guys, we have a major problem.
- Don't worry about Turtle.

07:28.581 --> 07:31.277
Johnny Drama's got one of his
sure things on the way.

07:31.317 --> 07:33.080
He's not talking
about me, asshole.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.314
The guy's been stressed out
about shit all day.

07:35.354 --> 07:36.946
What's the problem, E?

07:36.989 --> 07:39.457
All right, this is serious.
You can't tell Vince.

07:39.492 --> 07:42.461
- What is it?
- We have no money.

07:42.495 --> 07:46.056
- Yeah, right.
- Come on, E, what do you mean?

07:46.098 --> 07:48.931
Vince spent every last dollar he had
on that house down payment.

07:48.968 --> 07:51.232
We have no other money.
The bills keep piling up.

07:51.270 --> 07:53.830
- We gotta shut down the spending.
- E, would you relax?

07:53.873 --> 07:56.774
We got that big fat check from "Aquaman"
coming any day now.

07:56.809 --> 07:59.369
No, it's not.
They pulled the offer.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.779
You kidding?

08:04.817 --> 08:06.944
I am Queens Boulevard.

08:06.986 --> 08:08.715
Bam!

08:08.754 --> 08:10.949
That is why
you're a movie star.

08:10.990 --> 08:14.016
I got Dana Gordon's
assistant on the phone.

08:15.728 --> 08:17.696
What the fuck
are you wearing?

08:17.730 --> 08:19.721
I'm trying out new looks.

08:19.765 --> 08:21.892
This one's my Andre 3000.
You like?

08:21.934 --> 08:23.993
No, I don't. You look like
Michelle Kwan in drag.

08:24.036 --> 08:26.834
Do a triple fucking axel over
to the phone and try Cameron again.

08:26.873 --> 08:29.603
- Where is she, Amanda?
- This is Jan. Amanda was fired.

08:29.642 --> 08:33.304
- Jan, where is she?
- I'm sorry. I haven't seen her all day.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.313
- You new in town?
- I've been here a month.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.407
Okay, you probably
don't know me. You will.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.384
Pass this message
along to Dana.

08:39.418 --> 08:41.613
Tell her I still have
the pictures from Cancun.

08:41.654 --> 08:43.621
Tell her I'm gonna
start a website.

08:43.655 --> 08:46.955
I'm gonna take a full-page ad
in "The LA Times" advertising it.

08:46.993 --> 08:49.655
It will be called "I'm a Hollywood
Executive Whore dot-com,"

08:49.695 --> 08:52.027
and no password or fee
will be required.

08:52.064 --> 08:56.524
Tell her I want
a fucking callback.

08:56.569 --> 08:58.833
E, when can I sit down
with James Cameron?

08:58.871 --> 09:00.805
Ari's waiting for a call.

09:00.840 --> 09:03.900
Wow. Even Ari can't get
Cameron on the phone.

09:03.943 --> 09:05.911
Yo, Vince, James Cameron
ain't that great.

09:05.945 --> 09:08.743
What are you talking about?
You saw "Terminator" a hundred times.

09:08.781 --> 09:10.510
I watched it for Linda Hamilton.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.417
Plus he likes to see the governor
naked at the beginning.

09:13.452 --> 09:16.250
- Anthony.
- E. What's going on, players?

09:16.289 --> 09:19.816
- What's going on?
- Nothing like what you got going on.

09:19.859 --> 09:23.351
Listen, Vince, if they're looking
for a little color for that film,

09:23.396 --> 09:26.297
I'd be a great fish.
Prepare 'em to pay my quote though.

09:26.332 --> 09:28.323
- I'll do what I can.
- Hey, do more than that.

09:28.367 --> 09:30.995
Remember who got
your brother that part in "Barbershop."

09:31.037 --> 09:33.164
- They cut me out.
- You got paid, Drama,

09:33.205 --> 09:36.231
so shut the fuck up,
you ungrateful bitch.

09:36.275 --> 09:38.709
Jesus! All right,
take care, Vince, man.

09:38.744 --> 09:39.836
See ya, buddy.

09:39.879 --> 09:42.848
- Yeah.
- Hey, Vince.

09:42.882 --> 09:45.316
I got a table for you guys
right out here.

09:46.819 --> 09:48.946
So how you been?
You been busy, Jamie?

09:48.988 --> 09:51.149
Yeah, I've been
real good actually.

09:51.190 --> 09:53.215
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

09:53.259 --> 09:56.422
- Why don't you join us?
- Because I'm working, Turtle.

09:56.462 --> 09:58.430
Damn.

09:59.465 --> 10:00.955
Ice cold.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.436
Don't you worry, Turtle.
Lorraine is on her way.

10:04.470 --> 10:07.132
- James Cameron's office.
- Hi, who am I speaking with?

10:07.173 --> 10:08.800
This is James's assistant Emily.

10:08.841 --> 10:10.934
Hey, Emily, this is Ari Gold.
Do you know me?

10:10.977 --> 10:14.504
Yeah, Ari,
it's Emily.

10:14.547 --> 10:17.380
You're joking, right, Ari?

10:17.416 --> 10:20.544
Emily! I totally forgot
that you work over there.

10:20.586 --> 10:22.918
- How are you?
- I am good, Ari.

10:22.955 --> 10:26.186
- I'm amazing. You miss me?
- Like I miss head lice.

10:26.225 --> 10:28.250
Uh-oh.
Did we end badly?

10:28.294 --> 10:30.387
You were supposed to write me
a reference letter.

10:30.429 --> 10:32.420
I can write another one
if you're unhappy.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.593
- How do I get James on the phone?
- Wait for him to call you back.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.229
'Cause I totally gave him
all nine messages.

10:38.270 --> 10:39.828
Uh...

10:39.872 --> 10:42.932
Iisten, Emily, honey,
what do you know about "Aquaman"?

10:42.975 --> 10:44.670
That he fights crime underwater.

10:44.710 --> 10:46.177
Bye, Ari.

10:47.880 --> 10:51.008
You know, Johnny, I know
last night I said I was in,

10:51.050 --> 10:53.382
but new calves?

10:53.419 --> 10:55.444
Come on, man.
I can't let you do it.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.319
It's ridiculous.

10:57.356 --> 11:00.689
You know what, Vince? You're right.
I'm gonna put the calves on hold.

11:00.726 --> 11:04.093
Really? Just like that?

11:04.130 --> 11:06.462
Yeah, you made a good argument.

11:06.499 --> 11:09.263
And Vince, I was thinking,
that 70-inch plasma you got me,

11:09.301 --> 11:11.269
it's a little too big
for my room.

11:11.303 --> 11:14.363
If you don't mind,
I'd like to switch to a 50.

11:14.407 --> 11:16.272
Or maybe a 30.

11:16.308 --> 11:18.674
Maybe I don't even need
a TV in my room at all.

11:18.711 --> 11:21.737
I'm jerking off way too much
as it is anyway.

11:23.582 --> 11:25.550
Here's Lorraine.

11:25.584 --> 11:28.314
Damn, she's hot
for a sure thing, Drama.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.549
Relax. Let me
take care of this.

11:32.558 --> 11:35.118
Turtle, sit up straight.

11:35.161 --> 11:38.426
- Take your hat off, Turtle.
- Guys, don't mother me, okay?

11:38.464 --> 11:41.126
There's the guy I was telling you about,
in green-- Turtle.

11:41.167 --> 11:43.135
Give her a wave.

11:43.169 --> 11:45.899
No no, don't wave.
Give the nod.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.500
Yeah. What?

11:49.542 --> 11:53.740
Wait, baby, hold on.
He's a nice guy.

11:56.982 --> 12:00.315
- Don't sweat it, Turtle.
- You did the wave-nod, bro.

12:00.352 --> 12:04.152
She could smell your desperation
from the doorway. That was a lay-up.

12:04.190 --> 12:06.317
That's Staci.

12:06.358 --> 12:08.417
Hello.

12:08.461 --> 12:10.588
Hey, when are you
coming home?

12:10.629 --> 12:12.790
Pretty soon. We're just
finishing up lunch.

12:12.832 --> 12:15.266
You and the boys should come by.
I've got a bunch of friends

12:15.301 --> 12:17.531
- hanging out by the pool.
- Really?

12:17.570 --> 12:20.038
Is that girl Turtle
was talking to last night there?

12:20.072 --> 12:22.540
- She's here.
- All right. We'll see you soon.

12:22.575 --> 12:23.872
- Bye.
- Bye.

12:23.909 --> 12:25.877
- Jamie, can we get a check?
- Yeah.

12:25.911 --> 12:27.879
She's there.
She thinks you're cute.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.710
She saw you at night,
so don't be upset

12:29.749 --> 12:31.808
when you get there
and she's not so excited.

12:31.851 --> 12:34.012
Please, Drama.
All I need is a little Vince magic,

12:34.053 --> 12:36.021
- put me right back on track.
- Thanks, Vince.

12:36.055 --> 12:38.046
- I got that.
- I got it. I got it.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.921
All right, what the fuck
is going on?

12:39.959 --> 12:43.417
You guys haven't paid
for anything since '95. Come on.

12:43.462 --> 12:46.590
I don't even believe you
have money in your pockets.

12:46.632 --> 12:47.929
I got your Visa card, Vince.

12:49.969 --> 12:54.167
He doesn't want calves.
He doesn't want a new plasma.

12:54.206 --> 12:55.935
All right.

12:55.975 --> 12:58.500
Come on, 'fess up.
What, am I getting "Punk'd"?

13:01.113 --> 13:03.104
- Ask E.
- Ask E.

13:05.985 --> 13:07.509
How could you not tell me this?

13:07.553 --> 13:09.714
I'm waiting to hear from Ari
about what's going on.

13:09.755 --> 13:12.485
Don't hide things from me.
You're supposed to be my best friend.

13:12.525 --> 13:14.720
I'm your manager now.
I'm trying to do what's right.

13:14.760 --> 13:17.024
I'm walking around town
like a total jerkoff.

13:17.062 --> 13:20.031
I mean, people are
congratulating me.

13:20.065 --> 13:22.966
It's totally humiliating.
And we bought the house!

13:23.002 --> 13:25.197
What did Ari say?

13:25.404 --> 13:28.601
Here's the good news:
I spoke to Leo's agent.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.109
He's a friend.
He's out.

13:31.143 --> 13:33.941
Leo is booked until '09,
and beside that,

13:33.979 --> 13:36.573
since "Titanic" he won't
go anywhere near the water.

13:36.615 --> 13:39.015
- And this is good news?
- I'm trying, Vinnie.

13:39.051 --> 13:41.485
Yeah, well, try harder, Ari.

13:41.520 --> 13:45.012
You too, Eric. You're right,
you're not my friend on this.

13:45.057 --> 13:46.684
You're my manager.

13:46.725 --> 13:49.694
You sit around waiting
for other people to call you back.

13:49.728 --> 13:51.958
You sit around waiting
for him to call you back.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.828
Go somewhere
and do something.

13:53.866 --> 13:56.767
Don't tell me that it's good news
that a movie I didn't want to do

13:56.802 --> 14:01.501
that you talked me into
is still possibly mine.

14:01.540 --> 14:05.067
Now that James Cameron is doing
this movie, I want it, all right? Badly.

14:05.110 --> 14:07.738
So get up off your asses

14:07.780 --> 14:10.977
and accomplish something,
or I will find people who can.

14:12.418 --> 14:14.613
You can find your
own way home too.

14:17.523 --> 14:20.151
We gotta get Cameron
to see "Queens Boulevard."

14:20.192 --> 14:21.853
You haven't even seen it yet!

14:21.894 --> 14:24.692
I saw the scenes Vince looped today.
They looked amazing.

14:24.730 --> 14:27.494
So you want me to get
the biggest director in the game

14:27.533 --> 14:30.696
to see some low-budget indie flick
that you think is amazing

14:30.736 --> 14:33.899
based on some out-of-context scenes
from a looping stage.

14:33.939 --> 14:35.930
What do you suggest?

14:35.975 --> 14:39.001
I suggest that we get the two
of them in a room together.

14:39.044 --> 14:42.275
How you gonna do that, Ari? You can't
even get anyone to call you back.

14:42.314 --> 14:44.874
- I'm gonna call Emily.
- She doesn't care for us, Eric.

14:44.917 --> 14:47.112
Yeah well, there's no
"us" in "me," Ari.

14:49.288 --> 14:51.449
Yo, fuck Aquaman, Vince.

14:51.490 --> 14:54.220
There's plenty other
superheroes out there.

14:54.260 --> 14:58.060
- Yo, you'd make a great Green Lantern.
- Thanks, Turtle.

14:59.598 --> 15:01.395
Vince, guys, come on in.

15:20.753 --> 15:23.984
Oh, God is shining
down on me today.

15:24.023 --> 15:27.550
Turtle, if you can't get
laid here, turn your dick in.

15:27.593 --> 15:30.824
Come on, I'll introduce
you guys to the girls.

15:30.863 --> 15:32.831
I'm gonna find the loo.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.704
- Right there.
- Yo, Aquaman.

15:40.739 --> 15:42.764
What do you say you and l
dive into the pool,

15:42.808 --> 15:46.369
see who can hold our breath the longest?
I'll bet you a million dollars I win.

15:46.412 --> 15:49.040
You don't have that kind
of money yet, do you? I do.

15:49.081 --> 15:51.572
Vince, wait, I gotta
tell you something. Hold on, baby.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.744
I'll be right back. Vince...

15:56.455 --> 15:58.946
You are my idol. Seriously.

15:58.991 --> 16:01.551
Staci, she's a fucking thoroughbred.

16:01.593 --> 16:03.493
I've been trying
to close her for years.

16:03.529 --> 16:06.555
I offered her 100 grand once
for one night at the Four Seasons Maui.

16:06.598 --> 16:08.862
You know what she did?
She smacked me in the face.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.835
You are a stallion, man.

16:10.869 --> 16:14.202
It's not every day
somebody scores the madam.

16:14.239 --> 16:16.571
Madam?

16:16.608 --> 16:19.668
- Oh no, come on.
- I can't believe you didn't know that.

16:19.712 --> 16:22.010
You gotta be kidding me.
You're not kidding me?

16:22.047 --> 16:25.210
I got a house account here--
here and Nate 'n Al's.

16:25.250 --> 16:27.582
Just those two places, man.

16:27.619 --> 16:29.951
Oh, Vince, baby.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.583
Listen to me,
don't sweat it.

16:32.624 --> 16:35.616
Staci is one piece of pussy
that has no price.

16:39.965 --> 16:41.933
Dude.

16:45.437 --> 16:47.428
Eric Murphy.

16:49.341 --> 16:51.400
Why am I not surprised?

16:51.443 --> 16:53.843
I don't know.
I was kind of hoping you would be.

16:53.879 --> 16:55.847
Oh, well, I expected
you days ago.

16:55.881 --> 16:58.349
Yeah.

16:58.384 --> 17:00.682
Did you quit smoking yet?

17:00.719 --> 17:02.744
- Four months.
- Really?

17:02.788 --> 17:04.756
- Mm-hmm.
- Nice. Me too.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.781
- Really? Wow.
- Yeah.

17:06.825 --> 17:10.420
You wanna grab a cup
of coffee or something?

17:10.462 --> 17:13.089
Well, I guess you probably
can't leave here, right?

17:13.132 --> 17:15.099
James is not like Ari.

17:15.134 --> 17:17.227
I can do what I want.

17:17.269 --> 17:19.863
James. You call him James?

17:19.905 --> 17:22.373
The string painting she did,
I'm getting it framed.

17:22.407 --> 17:24.705
- You know that, right?
- She's very talented.

17:24.742 --> 17:27.405
- She does beautiful work.
- Ari, I think it's nice

17:27.445 --> 17:30.176
that you're finally taking
an interest in the family.

17:30.215 --> 17:32.683
Come on, why are you making
such a big deal of this?

17:32.718 --> 17:34.686
I'm not some absentee dad.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.813
- Come on.
- Ari.

17:36.855 --> 17:38.686
- Hey, baby.
- There's your dad.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.692
There she is.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.694
- Hey, sweetie.
- There's my girl.

17:42.728 --> 17:45.492
Hey, how are you?
Dana Gordon!

17:45.531 --> 17:47.396
I'll be right back.

17:49.435 --> 17:52.893
- You are an animal, Ari.
- Total surprise. Give me one second.

17:52.938 --> 17:55.202
Amazing you're still
showing up at school like this.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.175
Won't let the nanny do it? Whatever
they're paying you, it's not enough.

17:58.210 --> 18:00.178
What are you doing here?
It's not a good time.

18:00.212 --> 18:02.976
Okay, fine. When is a good time?
Tonight at your house?

18:03.015 --> 18:06.610
- lnvite your husband, have a slideshow.
- You're out of your mind.

18:06.652 --> 18:09.519
I have never been jerked around
like this before, Dana, never.

18:09.555 --> 18:13.548
And I will not tolerate it
from some glorified D-girl.

18:13.592 --> 18:16.527
Do not fucking talk to me like that,
Ari. My job is on the line.

18:16.562 --> 18:19.554
You don't think I want Vince?
I want Vince, Alan wants Vince.

18:19.598 --> 18:22.089
What about Mr. Cameron?
Does he want Vince?

18:22.134 --> 18:23.863
He doesn't
know who Vince is.

18:23.902 --> 18:25.631
Jesus!

18:25.671 --> 18:28.037
- Look, we're working on that.
- Okay, listen.

18:28.073 --> 18:30.234
Let's get the two of them
in a room together.

18:30.275 --> 18:33.870
Anywhere on this planet.
I will pay for it if I have to.

18:33.912 --> 18:36.005
Vinnie will take care
of the rest, all right?

18:36.048 --> 18:39.484
- Fine.
- All right.

18:41.019 --> 18:44.079
Baby, what are you--

18:45.224 --> 18:47.215
Can I get a ride?

18:49.061 --> 18:52.519
I flew in this stuff from
Colombia on my own private jet.

18:52.564 --> 18:55.431
Sandinistas don't know shit
about overthrowing a government,

18:55.467 --> 18:57.731
but I'll tell you,
they sure do grow some fine herb.

18:57.769 --> 19:00.966
- It's really nice, Bob.
- Bob, I don't know if you remember,

19:01.006 --> 19:03.873
but I did an ep
of "Full House" in '94.

19:03.909 --> 19:07.504
I played Stamos's
tough-guy nephew.

19:07.546 --> 19:10.947
Really? I don't remember that.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.110
Don't take it
personally, Johnny.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.052
I was so whacked out
on Vikes and Halcion

19:15.087 --> 19:17.885
during the '90s,
I don't remember shit.

19:19.258 --> 19:22.386
I'm clean now though, right?

19:24.296 --> 19:29.029
- I remember that part. You were great.
- Really?

19:29.067 --> 19:33.367
Hey, Misty, why don't you
show me your room, baby?

19:33.405 --> 19:36.670
Come on, I got some stuff
I want you to see.

19:36.708 --> 19:38.699
Got some Courvoisier.

19:40.312 --> 19:43.475
Did you just get
cock-blocked by Bob Saget?

19:45.317 --> 19:47.683
- Hi there.
- Are you mad?

19:47.719 --> 19:50.381
No, I'm just
a little shocked.

19:50.422 --> 19:52.151
Why?

19:52.191 --> 19:55.490
I don't know. I mean, do l, like,
owe you money now?

19:55.527 --> 19:57.927
Don't be an asshole, Vince.
I'm not a hooker.

19:57.963 --> 20:00.761
Good, because I've
never paid for sex.

20:00.799 --> 20:02.892
And I'm not looking to start,

20:02.935 --> 20:05.335
although you'd
be worth every penny.

20:05.370 --> 20:08.271
I should pay you.

20:09.641 --> 20:11.609
Oh my God,

20:11.643 --> 20:14.908
Iook at my poor boys.

20:14.947 --> 20:18.383
It's gonna be like telling them
there's no Santa Claus.

20:18.417 --> 20:22.080
Vince, I feel awful
about deceiving you guys.

20:22.120 --> 20:25.783
So I'm gonna pay for Turtle and Drama
to have a good time today

20:25.824 --> 20:28.725
- out of my own pocket.
- No, I can't let you do that.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.558
- How much is it?
- My girls usually get

20:31.597 --> 20:34.430
between $5,000 and $7,000
for the full pampering package.

20:36.034 --> 20:38.264
Wow.

20:38.303 --> 20:40.635
You know, money's
a little tight right now.

20:40.672 --> 20:42.663
Can I finance this?

20:42.708 --> 20:45.370
Sure.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.401
Right here.

20:50.482 --> 20:52.416
Right here.

21:05.864 --> 21:08.958
Oh oh!

21:12.170 --> 21:15.662
- What are you guys so happy about?
- Skyrockets in flight, E.

21:15.707 --> 21:19.040
- He had a little afternoon delight.
- What, the neighbor's house?

21:19.077 --> 21:22.843
I met this girl Jeanette. Couldn't lose
this girl in a maze-- she loved me.

21:22.881 --> 21:25.076
Yeah, mine too.
She took me up into her bedroom

21:25.117 --> 21:27.415
and performed like it was
strictly business.

21:27.452 --> 21:30.853
- I'm back, baby, I'm back.
- Yeah, baby.

21:30.889 --> 21:34.552
Hey, thanks, bro.
Look, I know these girls are pros,

21:34.593 --> 21:37.187
but don't tell Turtle.
It'll break his heart.

21:37.229 --> 21:40.130
Yo, Vince,
way to hook it up.

21:40.165 --> 21:42.633
I know those girls were hookers,
but don't tell John.

21:42.668 --> 21:45.068
His streak's like five times
as long as mine.

21:48.040 --> 21:51.441
- So, E, what do you got?
- I got something.

21:51.476 --> 21:54.070
- It's not perfect, but it's something.
- Would you just say it?

21:54.112 --> 21:56.080
James Cameron is gonna screen
"Queens Boulevard."

21:56.114 --> 21:58.674
- Yes!
- You talked to James Cameron?

21:58.717 --> 22:02.153
- Emily did actually, yeah.
- You're gonna start up with her again?

22:02.187 --> 22:03.779
We'll start as friends and see.

22:03.822 --> 22:06.552
Friends are girls you just haven't
fucked yet. You know that.

22:06.591 --> 22:09.617
Thanks for the wisdom. I'm gonna go
see Walsh. Anybody wanna come?

22:09.661 --> 22:11.424
- Nope.
- No.

22:14.366 --> 22:16.357
Hey.

22:16.401 --> 22:18.369
Real sorry to bother you, Eric,

22:18.403 --> 22:20.701
but can you explain why
my meeting's canceled?

22:20.739 --> 22:24.641
- What meeting, Ari?
- Vince's meeting with James Cameron.

22:24.676 --> 22:26.667
They said that he will
not take the meeting

22:26.712 --> 22:29.112
until after he sees
"Queens Boulevard."

22:29.147 --> 22:32.583
Can you fucking explain
that to me, Eric?

22:32.617 --> 22:34.346
I didn't think you
could get the meeting.

22:34.386 --> 22:36.581
Emily didn't think so either.
Don't worry about it.

22:36.621 --> 22:38.589
- Cameron'll love it.
- He better.

22:38.623 --> 22:42.081
Because you know what?
It's all on you now, Eric.

22:51.670 --> 22:55.401
- Billy!
- Suit, what's the word?

22:55.440 --> 22:57.738
Got great news.
Before they finalize Vince's deal,

22:57.776 --> 23:00.472
James Cameron wants to screen
"Queens Boulevard."

23:00.512 --> 23:02.343
- You serious?
- Believe that shit?

23:02.381 --> 23:04.042
James Cameron
is gonna see your movie.

23:04.082 --> 23:06.550
- He's coming to Sundance?
- No, we're gonna send a print

23:06.585 --> 23:09.315
- to his house.
- Fuck that.

23:09.354 --> 23:11.914
Hey, neighbor.
Hi, Billy.

23:11.957 --> 23:14.653
We have to make this quick.
I have a 9:00.

23:14.693 --> 23:16.820
Billy, look,
this is important, man.

23:16.862 --> 23:19.490
Look, suit,
nobody sees my film till Sundance.

23:19.531 --> 23:22.261
James Cameron wants to see it,
tell him he can stand in line

23:22.300 --> 23:24.268
in the snow
like everybody else.

23:24.302 --> 23:26.930
Excuse me. I only have an hour
to take care of business.

23:26.972 --> 23:28.371
- Shall we?
- Billy, listen--

23:28.407 --> 23:31.274
I think I made myself clear.

23:36.748 --> 23:38.909
Can I have a shot
of Jack?

23:39.305 --> 23:45.879
