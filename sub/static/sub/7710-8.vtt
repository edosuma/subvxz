WEBVTT

00:12.213 --> 00:13.681
You should get
one of these.

00:13.714 --> 00:15.383
No. Thank you.

00:15.416 --> 00:18.386
Do you even know
what this is?

00:18.419 --> 00:19.553
It is a fitness orb.

00:19.587 --> 00:23.191
And it has completely
changed my life.

00:23.224 --> 00:25.693
Forget everything
you thought you knew

00:25.726 --> 00:27.561
about ab workouts.
Done.

00:27.595 --> 00:28.829
This ab workout

00:28.862 --> 00:32.633
is specifically designed
to strengthen your core.

00:32.666 --> 00:34.102
Sorry.

00:34.135 --> 00:35.503
That's all right.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.071
Numerous health benefits.

00:40.708 --> 00:41.809
Strengthens your back.

00:41.842 --> 00:44.345
Better performance
in sports.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.114
More enjoyable sex.

00:46.147 --> 00:48.416
You're not having sex.

00:51.419 --> 00:53.587
Plus improves
your reflexes.

00:54.822 --> 00:56.624
See, I would've
caught that.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.859
Okay, you know what,
uh, how much is that?

00:58.892 --> 01:00.761
It's only 25 bucks.
Wow.

01:00.794 --> 01:04.165
Um, okay.

01:12.873 --> 01:21.415
*

01:44.538 --> 01:47.575
Pam, could I see you
in my office?

01:47.608 --> 01:52.646
Today, we're having performance
reviews company wide.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.248
Last year,
my performance review started

01:54.282 --> 01:57.618
with Michael asking me
what my hopes and dreams were,

01:57.651 --> 01:59.753
and it ended with him
telling me

01:59.787 --> 02:02.723
he could bench-press
190 pounds.

02:02.756 --> 02:05.926
So I don't really know
what to expect.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.728
Pam,
you're trustworthy.

02:07.761 --> 02:08.762
Thank you.

02:08.796 --> 02:10.498
And a woman.
Oh no.

02:10.531 --> 02:13.301
And I want you to listen
to a voice mail from my boss.

02:13.334 --> 02:15.803
Michael, it's Jan.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.338
I guess I missed you.

02:17.371 --> 02:19.340
I'll, uh, be there
this afternoon

02:19.373 --> 02:20.674
for performance reviews.

02:20.708 --> 02:22.743
I hope it's understood

02:22.776 --> 02:24.745
that that will be
our only topic of discussion.

02:24.778 --> 02:25.779
See you soon.

02:25.813 --> 02:27.815
First impressions?

02:27.848 --> 02:30.284
Uh, just off the top,

02:30.318 --> 02:33.454
I think she'll be here
this afternoon.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.623
My boss is coming in today.

02:35.656 --> 02:36.824
The lovely
Jan Levinson-Gould.

02:36.857 --> 02:38.692
Well, no Gould.

02:38.726 --> 02:40.828
The Gould has been
divorce.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.730
Um, the awkward part

02:42.763 --> 02:44.698
is that this
is the first time

02:44.732 --> 02:47.768
we'll be seeing each other
since...

02:47.801 --> 02:49.537
well...

02:49.570 --> 02:51.672
Uh, it was really nothing.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.707
We just sort of got
caught up in the moment.

02:53.741 --> 02:57.378
The vulnerable devorcée
gives herself

02:57.411 --> 02:59.647
to the understanding
with rugged good looks

02:59.680 --> 03:00.781
office manager.

03:00.814 --> 03:02.450
Just, uh,

03:02.483 --> 03:06.287
she didn't want it
to continue for some reason.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.788
We both didn't--
I didn't want--

03:07.821 --> 03:09.790
we both didn't want it
to continue.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.925
It was not professional.

03:11.959 --> 03:14.528
Um, when people say
something's mutual,

03:14.562 --> 03:18.866
it never is,
but this was mutual.

03:18.899 --> 03:21.269
I guess I missed you.

03:21.302 --> 03:23.904
I guess I missed you.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.673
So she misses me.

03:25.706 --> 03:28.342
She missed you.

03:28.376 --> 03:31.279
But then she goes on to say,

03:31.312 --> 03:33.447
"That will be our only topic
of our discussion."

03:33.481 --> 03:34.682
That doesn't mean anything.

03:34.715 --> 03:35.849
Those are just words.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.685
I have one idea
of what it means.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.453
Okay. Yeah. What

03:39.487 --> 03:41.322
Well, I don't think
you're going to be

03:41.355 --> 03:43.491
very happy with this.
Oh great.

03:43.524 --> 03:46.860
All right, well,
now I'm in a terrible mood.

03:46.894 --> 03:49.397
Let's do
your performance review.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.265
Because she's conflicted.

03:51.299 --> 03:52.800
She has to be
professional,

03:52.833 --> 03:56.470
but she's fighting
feelings for you.

03:56.504 --> 03:58.739
Ah. Why--
That's great news.

03:58.772 --> 04:00.908
That--that--
Then why would--

04:00.941 --> 04:02.510
why would I not
like that?

04:02.543 --> 04:04.778
Um, just cause
that you work together,

04:04.812 --> 04:07.681
and it might be awkward.
Wow. Wow.

04:07.715 --> 04:10.718
All right, let's listen
to that again.

04:10.751 --> 04:11.852
Michael, it's Jan.

04:11.885 --> 04:13.521
I guess I missed you.

04:13.554 --> 04:15.689
Oh, hey.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.325
Listen, Jim.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.627
Here's a little tip
for your performance review.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.028
Okay.

04:21.061 --> 04:23.431
Tell Michael that we
should be stocking more

04:23.464 --> 04:26.300
of the double tabbed
manilla file folders.

04:26.334 --> 04:27.901
We don't have double tabbed
manilla files folders.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.570
Oh yes we do.
No, we don't.

04:29.603 --> 04:30.704
Yeah, it's a new product.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.706
So you should just
suggest that to him,

04:32.740 --> 04:35.609
and then he'll be sure
to give you a raise.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.044
We'll, I'm not asking
for a raise.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.780
I'm gonna actually be asking
for a pay decrease.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.782
Uh, that is so stupid.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.784
What if he gives it
to you?

04:43.817 --> 04:46.019
I win.
Ugh.

04:46.053 --> 04:47.087
You know what,

04:47.120 --> 04:49.757
I am going to zone you out
for the rest of today.

04:49.790 --> 04:50.891
I need to stay focused.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.493
And I don't have
to see you

04:52.526 --> 04:53.627
tomorrow or Sunday.

04:53.661 --> 04:54.895
Please don't call me,

04:54.928 --> 04:57.765
and we'll see how things go
on Monday.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.833
Stupid.

04:59.867 --> 05:02.002
Wait, wait. One thing.

05:02.035 --> 05:05.573
Um, by tomorrow,
you mean Saturday, right?

05:05.606 --> 05:07.040
Uh, duh.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.876
Duh.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.378
Today is Thursday.

05:10.411 --> 05:11.912
But Dwight thinks
that it's Friday.

05:11.945 --> 05:13.747
And that's what
I'll be working on

05:13.781 --> 05:15.616
this afternoon.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.651
Sometimes women say more
in their pauses

05:17.685 --> 05:19.620
than they say
in their words.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.555
Really.
Oh yes.

05:21.589 --> 05:23.357
Let's listen to it again.

05:23.391 --> 05:25.693
And this time,
really listen to the pauses.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.528
God, Stanley,
that's freakin' brilliant.

05:27.561 --> 05:28.662
How do you know that?

05:28.696 --> 05:30.698
Did you learn that
on the streets?

05:30.731 --> 05:32.032
Sorry.

05:32.065 --> 05:34.735
Oh, it's okay.
I did learn it on the streets.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.370
On the ghetto, in fact.

05:36.404 --> 05:38.739
No kidding.

05:38.772 --> 05:41.041
It's all about my bonus.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.978
Michael and Jan
definitely made out.
Oh.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.980
Maybe more.
Eck.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.750
Oh, also it is Thursday,

05:49.783 --> 05:50.918
but Dwight thinks
it's Friday,

05:50.951 --> 05:52.720
so keep that going.

05:52.753 --> 05:54.054
Yay.

05:58.559 --> 05:59.993
Good work, Stanley.
Great performance review.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.463
Stanley in the house,
everybody.

06:02.496 --> 06:03.597
Whoo!

06:03.631 --> 06:05.098
Angela, your turn.

06:05.132 --> 06:08.436
I actually look forward
to performance reviews.

06:08.469 --> 06:09.970
I did the youth beauty
pageant circuit.

06:10.003 --> 06:11.672
And I enjoyed that
quite a bit.

06:11.705 --> 06:15.509
I really enjoy being judged.

06:15.543 --> 06:20.147
I believe I hold up very well
to even severe scrutiny.

06:20.180 --> 06:21.649
Michael.
Yeah.

06:21.682 --> 06:23.484
Jan's on the phone
for you.

06:23.517 --> 06:26.186
Oh. Angela, you were totally
satisfactory this year.

06:28.121 --> 06:29.590
Interesting.
Jan is calling me.

06:29.623 --> 06:32.560
Maybe it wasn't
so mutual after all.

06:32.593 --> 06:33.727
Yeah.

06:33.761 --> 06:34.895
Michael.

06:34.928 --> 06:37.431
Jan, to what do I owe
this pleasure?

06:37.465 --> 06:39.700
I am returning
your many calls.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.869
Well, hello to you too.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.037
Um, yeah, I was just, um,

06:44.071 --> 06:45.906
I just wanted to get
some closure

06:45.939 --> 06:48.609
on what transpired
between us at the meeting

06:48.642 --> 06:52.145
we had in the parking lot
of the Chili's.

06:54.615 --> 06:55.883
No.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.051
No. We--we won't
be discussing that, Michael.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.720
The only things
I want to talk about

06:59.753 --> 07:01.221
during your performance
review

07:01.254 --> 07:04.024
are your concrete ideas
to improve your branch.

07:04.057 --> 07:07.628
Well, surely this, uh,
review

07:07.661 --> 07:11.499
is a formality because
of what happened, uh,

07:11.532 --> 07:13.567
at our meeting in the parking
lot of the Chili's.

07:13.601 --> 07:16.236
Review is anything but
a formality, Michael.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.906
And, uh, I expect you
to forget anything

07:18.939 --> 07:21.609
that you think may have
happened between us

07:21.642 --> 07:24.778
and exhibit completely
professional behavior.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.246
I'm thinking about you.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.516
Okay, that is an example

07:28.549 --> 07:30.684
of completely unprofessional
behavior.

07:30.718 --> 07:31.985
I don't see
how that's unprofessional.

07:32.019 --> 07:33.153
Michael.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.955
Yeah.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.957
Are the cameras in there
with you in your office?

07:36.990 --> 07:39.627
No, they are not.

07:39.660 --> 07:42.663
Yes, they are.

07:44.532 --> 07:46.534
That's my girlfriend.

07:46.567 --> 07:50.137
I heard they made out
and had sex.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.606
I heard they just made out.
That's it.

07:52.640 --> 07:56.910
Well, I heard
they made out...

07:56.944 --> 07:58.979
and had sex.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.981
Don't talk about it.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.550
Office romances
are nobody's business

08:02.583 --> 08:04.785
but the people involved.

08:07.621 --> 08:10.090
Romances?

08:10.123 --> 08:12.259
Pam, I have ideas
on a daily business.

08:12.292 --> 08:13.994
I know I do.

08:14.027 --> 08:17.164
I have a clear memory
of telling people my ideas.

08:17.197 --> 08:18.999
Um, is there any chance

08:19.032 --> 08:21.168
that you wrote
any of my ideas down

08:21.201 --> 08:23.203
in a folder
like a idea folder?

08:23.236 --> 08:24.805
Sorry.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.940
That's unfortunate.

08:26.974 --> 08:29.543
How about the suggestion box?

08:29.577 --> 08:31.278
There's tons of ideas
in there.

08:31.311 --> 08:32.746
What suggestion box?

08:32.780 --> 08:34.281
The suggestion box
that I put out,

08:34.314 --> 08:36.249
and people could put in
suggestions anonymously.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.285
Maybe there's prizes.

08:38.318 --> 08:39.519
Oh, yeah.

08:39.553 --> 08:42.022
I-I think I remember that
from back when I first started.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.056
Why don't you find it

08:43.090 --> 08:44.925
and then tell people
to get theirs--

08:44.958 --> 08:45.993
Never mind. I'll tell them.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.227
Hello, everybody.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.796
Yeah. Uh, attention,
please.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.230
Jan Levinson's coming

08:50.263 --> 08:51.632
very soon.

08:51.665 --> 08:52.833
And so we're going
to have

08:52.866 --> 08:54.802
our weekly suggestion box
meeting.

08:54.835 --> 08:57.971
So you can all get in
your constructive compliments

08:58.005 --> 09:00.207
ASAP.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.274
Don't you mean
constructive criticism?

09:01.308 --> 09:02.342
What did I say?

09:02.375 --> 09:03.711
You said constructive
compliments.

09:03.744 --> 09:04.912
That doesn't make
any sense.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.246
Well, Kelly,

09:06.279 --> 09:07.815
that was neither constructive
nor a compliment.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.282
So maybe you should stop
criticizing my English

09:09.316 --> 09:11.284
and start making
some suggestions.

09:11.318 --> 09:13.887
Okay?

09:13.921 --> 09:15.155
Hey, Dan,
this is Jim.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.290
It is about 11:15
and I wanted to know

09:17.324 --> 09:18.626
what you were
up to tomorrow,

09:18.659 --> 09:22.262
which is the 15th
and that is a...

09:22.295 --> 09:24.197
Saturday.
Saturday.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.166
So just let me know
what you're doing tomorrow,

09:26.199 --> 09:27.835
Saturday, for lunch.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.637
Okay, talk to you soon.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.245
Okay, bye-bye.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.947
Would you please tell Michael
that I'm here?

09:39.980 --> 09:41.715
Sure.

09:41.749 --> 09:42.883
Hi, Jan.
How are you?

09:42.916 --> 09:44.284
Hi, Michael.
I'm good. How are you.

09:44.317 --> 09:46.119
Good to see you.
Nice to see you.

09:46.153 --> 09:47.621
Okay.

09:47.655 --> 09:50.624
Okay, why don't we
just step into my off--

09:50.658 --> 09:51.825
We're going to go
in here.

09:51.859 --> 09:53.260
Can we please go
into your office?

09:53.293 --> 09:54.762
Right after you.

09:54.795 --> 09:57.330
Après vous.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.674
Oh, thank you.

10:06.707 --> 10:07.808
It's nice
to see you.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.042
Nice to see you too,
Michael.

10:09.076 --> 10:09.977
Really?

10:10.010 --> 10:11.111
Not like that.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.980
Oh, well...

10:13.013 --> 10:14.915
You know, Michael,
I think I need to make

10:14.948 --> 10:16.183
something clear
right off the top.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.351
I'm not going to discuss
anything with you

10:18.385 --> 10:20.353
other than Dunder Mifflin
business.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.055
All right.
Period.

10:22.089 --> 10:23.323
Do we understand
each other?

10:23.356 --> 10:24.825
Absolutely.

10:24.858 --> 10:25.759
I'm a little confused

10:25.793 --> 10:27.394
because first it's all like
kissy kissy.

10:27.427 --> 10:28.896
And then it's like
all regret.

10:28.929 --> 10:30.030
Because, oh,
I regret that.

10:30.063 --> 10:32.032
But wait, I'm still
going to call you

10:32.065 --> 10:35.035
but--but we're just
going to talk business.

10:35.068 --> 10:37.370
And I may come down there
and fire you

10:37.404 --> 10:38.939
if you don't do your job.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.975
But what were we talking
about when we first kissed?

10:42.009 --> 10:43.844
Business.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.145
So are you still
in the middle

10:45.178 --> 10:46.313
of the performance
reviews then?

10:46.346 --> 10:47.681
No, no, no.

10:47.715 --> 10:48.949
I finished all of that.
I'm very fast.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.283
I'm not too fast.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.919
Not like wham, bam,
thank you, ma'am.

10:51.952 --> 10:54.021
But I do say thank you,
ma'am.

10:54.054 --> 10:56.289
I'm not like, wham, bam.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.291
Not that there's anything
wrong with wham, bam

10:58.325 --> 11:00.728
if it's consensual.

11:00.761 --> 11:04.865
We're talking
about office stuff.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.201
Can I ask you a question?

11:08.235 --> 11:09.770
No.

11:09.803 --> 11:10.904
This is a business question.

11:10.938 --> 11:12.706
It's nothing personal.
I promise.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.341
Fine.

11:14.374 --> 11:18.211
Are you wearing
new perfume today?

11:18.245 --> 11:19.913
How is that
a business question?

11:19.947 --> 11:22.115
Well, you're wearing it
at the office.

11:22.149 --> 11:23.984
And...
It...

11:24.017 --> 11:26.920
I'm sorry, no offense,
but it's really sexy.

11:26.954 --> 11:28.688
Please don't smell me,
Michael.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.227
Hey, Jim.
Hey, how's it going?

11:34.261 --> 11:35.195
Oh, my God.

11:35.228 --> 11:36.997
Did you seed The Apprentice
last night?

11:37.030 --> 11:38.265
Of course.
It's on every Thursday night.

11:38.298 --> 11:39.800
So how can I miss it?

11:39.833 --> 11:40.934
Can you believe
who Trump fired?

11:40.968 --> 11:42.135
No.
That was unbelievable.

11:42.169 --> 11:43.203
Who

11:43.236 --> 11:44.271
Who did he fire?

11:44.304 --> 11:45.472
You didn't see it?
No.

11:45.505 --> 11:46.974
I went out and got drunk

11:47.007 --> 11:48.475
with my laser tag team
last night.

11:48.508 --> 11:49.843
Crap.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.478
I never go out
on a Thursday night.

11:51.511 --> 11:54.447
what the hell
was I thinking?

11:54.481 --> 11:55.816
I don't understand--

11:56.917 --> 11:58.385
Hold on. Sorry.

11:58.418 --> 11:59.486
Yes, Pam.

11:59.519 --> 12:02.055
Michael, it's time
for the suggestion box meeting.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.924
I'm kind of in the middle
of something.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.225
I wish you wouldn't
interrupt.

12:05.258 --> 12:06.760
You told me to buzz you

12:06.794 --> 12:07.895
about the suggestion box
meeting

12:07.928 --> 12:08.661
when Jan was here.

12:08.695 --> 12:10.998
I did not--not use
those words.

12:11.031 --> 12:12.966
Uh, I'd like to sit in
on that meeting.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.134
Is it happening
right now?

12:14.167 --> 12:15.803
No, it's in,
like, 10 minutes.

12:15.836 --> 12:16.870
Everyone's waiting
in the conference room.

12:16.904 --> 12:19.406
Great. Very good.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.879
Why are we here?

12:25.913 --> 12:27.981
Because I value
your opinions.

12:28.015 --> 12:29.817
Now I know a lot of you
don't think

12:29.850 --> 12:31.118
that I read
your suggestions,

12:31.151 --> 12:32.419
but I do.

12:32.452 --> 12:33.921
I just sift through them
every week.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.923
And I really look
and scrutinize

12:35.956 --> 12:38.525
to see what you guys
are writing.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.894
Um, so let's just, uh,

12:40.928 --> 12:43.096
read some of these suckers,
okay?

12:43.130 --> 12:44.264
All right.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.866
Number one,
what should we do

12:45.899 --> 12:47.067
to prepare for Y2K?

12:47.100 --> 12:49.837
What should we do
to prepare for Y2K?

12:49.870 --> 12:51.371
I thought you read these
every week?

12:51.404 --> 12:53.206
Well, obviously,
this one got stuck in the box.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.942
That happens occasionally.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.576
It happens occasionally.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.946
And, um, so one down.

12:58.979 --> 13:01.248
Next suggestion.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.850
We need better outreach

13:02.883 --> 13:04.852
for employees
fighting depression.

13:04.885 --> 13:07.888
Okay. All right.
Enough with the jokes.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.957
Nobody in here
is suffering from depression.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.591
That sounds serious,
Michael.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.593
Oh. Okay. Well, yeah.

13:13.626 --> 13:14.962
Who wrote it?
Tom.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.830
Tom. Then it is a joke

13:16.864 --> 13:19.299
because there is nobody
in here named Tom.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.902
Tom? He worked in accounting
up until about a year ago.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.205
Tom.

13:26.639 --> 13:30.010
Oh, that guy.
That guy was weird.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.111
All right, next suggestion.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.579
Next suggestion.

13:32.612 --> 13:35.883
Ar, badoo badoo.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.550
You need to do something
about your B.O.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.386
You need to do something
about your B.O.

13:39.419 --> 13:42.055
Okay, now I don't know who this
suggestion is meant for,

13:42.089 --> 13:44.591
but it's more
of a personal suggestion.

13:44.624 --> 13:46.526
And it's not an office
suggestion.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.896
Far be it from me
to use this as a platform

13:48.929 --> 13:50.097
to embarrass anybody.

13:50.130 --> 13:53.433
Aren't the suggestions
meant for you?

13:53.466 --> 13:54.902
Well, Toby,

13:54.935 --> 13:59.072
if by me you are inferring
that I have B.O.,

13:59.106 --> 14:02.375
then I would say that that
is a very poor choice of words.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.544
Uh, Michael,

14:04.577 --> 14:05.879
he wasn't inferring,
he was implying.

14:05.913 --> 14:07.580
You were inferring.

14:07.614 --> 14:08.481
Was I, Creed?

14:08.515 --> 14:11.584
Okay, well, you know
what I am implying

14:11.618 --> 14:14.287
is that when we're on
an elevator together,

14:14.321 --> 14:16.456
I should maybe
take the stairs

14:16.489 --> 14:18.491
because talk about stank.

14:18.525 --> 14:19.626
Not that I would ever

14:19.659 --> 14:21.561
say something like that
in public

14:21.594 --> 14:23.330
and I never have
and I never will,

14:23.363 --> 14:24.597
I just think it's something

14:24.631 --> 14:26.166
that we should all
be aware of, okay?

14:26.199 --> 14:28.435
Now that
we've learned this,

14:28.468 --> 14:30.603
let's continue.

14:30.637 --> 14:31.571
See, this is good.

14:31.604 --> 14:32.973
We're learning,

14:33.006 --> 14:34.041
and we're figuring
some stuff out.

14:34.074 --> 14:36.043
You need to do something
about your coffee breath.

14:36.076 --> 14:38.311
You need to do--
Shut up. Shut up.
Shut up, Dwight.

14:38.345 --> 14:40.147
Okay, I don't think
you people are grasping

14:40.180 --> 14:42.582
the concept
of the suggestion box.

14:42.615 --> 14:46.519
Sometimes you talk to us
real close.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.555
Yeah? Is that hard
for you?

14:48.588 --> 14:51.091
All right.
Well, when you have
coffee breath, it's hard.

14:52.559 --> 14:53.126
Let's k--
let's keep going.

14:55.195 --> 14:56.496
Yup.

14:56.529 --> 14:58.098
What do we have here?

14:58.131 --> 14:59.599
We have...

14:59.632 --> 15:01.168
somebody's piece of gum.

15:01.201 --> 15:02.635
Somebody put a piece
of gum in there.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.637
This is not a-a garbage can.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.506
This is the future
of our company.

15:06.539 --> 15:09.509
This is not a place
for gum, okay?

15:09.542 --> 15:11.511
I don't want to have
to read these tomorrow...

15:11.544 --> 15:13.680
Yeah, who wants to come in
on a Saturday?

15:13.713 --> 15:16.483
Yeah. What? No.
All right.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.551
Next suggestion.
Next suggestion.

15:20.653 --> 15:22.122
Don't--
Okay, that's blank.

15:22.155 --> 15:23.290
Don't-- Just--

15:23.323 --> 15:24.691
Don't sleep
with your boss.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.395
Do you think
this is referring

15:28.428 --> 15:29.929
to you boning Jan?

15:31.698 --> 15:33.666
I can't--I can't--
I don't understand
why you're so upset.

15:33.700 --> 15:34.934
All right,
please sit down.

15:34.968 --> 15:37.604
I'm going to sit over here.
You're going to sit over there.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.606
Let me ask you this.
Please sit yourself down.

15:39.639 --> 15:42.142
Let me ask you something.
Where did you get your outfit?

15:44.744 --> 15:46.479
You're gonna give me
this raise.

15:46.513 --> 15:49.316
I deserve this raise.

15:49.349 --> 15:52.352
Yes. Yes! Yes!

15:52.385 --> 15:54.387
Ha!

15:54.421 --> 15:55.355
The least you can do

15:55.388 --> 15:57.524
is keep my salary consistent
with inflation.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.359
Kah-ah!

15:59.392 --> 16:02.062
Yes! Why are you going
to give me this raise?

16:02.095 --> 16:04.597
Why?

16:04.631 --> 16:07.600
Because I'm awesome!

16:07.634 --> 16:10.403
I am awesome!

16:10.437 --> 16:12.505
I just don't understand

16:12.539 --> 16:15.475
why you have to pretend
like nothing happened.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.110
Because nothing did, Michael.

16:17.144 --> 16:19.079
I'm not going

16:19.112 --> 16:20.413
to say anything more
about it,

16:20.447 --> 16:22.249
and I would advise
that you do the same.

16:22.282 --> 16:23.383
Look.

16:23.416 --> 16:24.517
Michael.
Oh my God.

16:24.551 --> 16:25.318
I'm sorry.
I'm interrupting.

16:25.352 --> 16:27.554
Oh God.
Were you guys making out?

16:27.587 --> 16:29.556
No, Dwight. Come in.
Great.

16:29.589 --> 16:30.423
What do you want,
Dwight?

16:30.457 --> 16:33.126
I am ready
for my performance review.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.294
Okay. Great.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.762
Your performance
has been adequate.

16:35.795 --> 16:37.364
You may leave.

16:37.397 --> 16:38.565
Good-bye.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.400
Is this how
you've been conducting

16:40.433 --> 16:41.601
all the reviews, Michael?

16:41.634 --> 16:43.270
You want to talk now?
Good.

16:43.303 --> 16:44.571
Okay, Dwight, leave.

16:44.604 --> 16:45.372
Uh, wait.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.307
I would like to discuss
my raise.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.576
Why on earth
would we give you a raise?

16:49.609 --> 16:50.577
That is an excellent
question.

16:50.610 --> 16:53.746
Thank you for asking.

16:53.780 --> 16:56.216
Let me bring up one word.

16:56.249 --> 16:57.817
Dedication.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.720
I have never...

17:00.753 --> 17:02.422
been late.

17:02.455 --> 17:05.292
Also I have never
missed a day due to illness.

17:05.325 --> 17:08.161
Even when I had walking
pneumonia.

17:08.195 --> 17:10.497
I even come in on holidays.

17:10.530 --> 17:11.731
You do?

17:11.764 --> 17:13.100
How do you get in?

17:13.133 --> 17:14.567
I have a copy of your key.

17:14.601 --> 17:16.669
That's a serious offense.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.605
That is a serious offense.
Very serious.

17:18.638 --> 17:21.541
As is toying
with a man's heart.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.376
Oh, Michael,
for God sakes.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.512
I'd also further like to talk
about my merits

17:25.545 --> 17:26.446
in the workplace.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.481
Okay, third wheel,
why don't you do that?

17:28.515 --> 17:30.517
For instance, the time
I brought in deer jerky

17:30.550 --> 17:31.484
for the whole office.

17:31.518 --> 17:32.752
That was deer? Gross.

17:32.785 --> 17:34.354
You liked it.
Oh God. Did not.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.555
Jan, have you ever
had deer?

17:35.588 --> 17:37.757
No.
It's a delicacy.

17:37.790 --> 17:39.392
And, you know what,
it's an aphrodisiac.

17:39.426 --> 17:40.593
So when we're done here,

17:40.627 --> 17:42.429
you guys could go over
to the Antler Lodge,

17:42.462 --> 17:44.231
sample some deer,
and talk about my raise.

17:44.264 --> 17:45.565
What do you say, Jan?

17:45.598 --> 17:46.766
Okay. Here's what
I'm going to do.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.468
I'm going to step outside,

17:48.501 --> 17:49.369
collect my thoughts,

17:49.402 --> 17:51.438
and I will return
in about 10 minutes.

17:51.471 --> 17:52.705
Okay, you just, uh,
clear your head.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.707
Thank you,
Dwight.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.343
Look. I know it's your job.

17:56.376 --> 17:57.444
I know you have to ask.

17:57.477 --> 17:58.711
But I promise you,

17:58.745 --> 18:00.580
I'm not going to discuss it
with him.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.382
I'm certainly not
going to discuss it with you.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.351
Do you have a light?

18:04.384 --> 18:05.518
And in conclusion,

18:05.552 --> 18:07.587
I think Lex Luther
said it best

18:07.620 --> 18:11.558
when he said,
"Dad, you have no idea

18:11.591 --> 18:12.725
what I'm capable of."

18:12.759 --> 18:14.327
That's from Superman?

18:14.361 --> 18:15.495
Smallville.

18:15.528 --> 18:19.399
And that is why I feel
I deserve

18:19.432 --> 18:22.269
this raise.

18:22.302 --> 18:27.340
Do you think Michael and Jan
actually...

18:27.374 --> 18:28.641
I don't really want
to picture it,

18:28.675 --> 18:29.876
but thank you, Pam.

18:29.909 --> 18:32.579
How do you come back
from that?

18:32.612 --> 18:36.449
Um, you don't, I don't think,
come all the way back, you know.

18:36.483 --> 18:38.451
Especially
working together.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.153
No, I mean,
doing that with Michael.

18:40.187 --> 18:41.721
How do you come back
from that

18:41.754 --> 18:43.156
as a human being?

18:43.190 --> 18:45.725
Oh. Yeah. No.
I don't think you can.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.460
I'm heading back

18:47.494 --> 18:48.495
to New York.

18:48.528 --> 18:50.597
Allan and I will conduct
your performance review

18:50.630 --> 18:52.299
over the phone tomorrow,
okay?

18:52.332 --> 18:53.466
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.602
No, no. I just--I just want
to know why.

18:55.635 --> 18:58.605
Michael, now is not
the time or the place.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.308
Okay. So you're saying
that there is a different time

19:01.341 --> 19:02.775
or place that we can have
this discussion.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.245
No, I am saying we are never
gonna have this conversation.

19:05.278 --> 19:08.481
Well, okay.
Never as in never ever ever?

19:08.515 --> 19:09.916
Or never as in
there's no chance?

19:09.949 --> 19:12.519
Never for me
always means never ever ever.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.487
I just want to know
from the horse's mouth

19:14.521 --> 19:17.490
what is the dealio.
You know, Michael...

19:17.524 --> 19:20.360
Am I too short?
Michael, it has nothing
to do with your looks, okay?

19:20.393 --> 19:21.561
It's your personality.

19:21.594 --> 19:22.629
I mean, you're obnoxious

19:22.662 --> 19:26.399
and rude
and--and--and stupid.

19:26.433 --> 19:27.900
And you do have
coffee breath

19:27.934 --> 19:29.269
by the way.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.571
And--and I don't agree
about the B.O.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.473
But you are very, very
inconsiderate.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.342
Really?

19:35.375 --> 19:37.210
Really.

19:37.244 --> 19:38.378
You're--you're--you're...

19:38.411 --> 19:39.779
you're a great guy,
okay?

19:39.812 --> 19:41.648
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

19:41.681 --> 19:42.915
You were very sweet.

19:42.949 --> 19:45.585
And you stayed up with me
and talked to me

19:45.618 --> 19:47.587
and cried with me
and I appreciate that.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.222
No, I wasn't.

19:49.256 --> 19:50.390
I wasn't crying.

19:50.423 --> 19:52.425
But I am just not
in the place right now

19:52.459 --> 19:54.394
where I'm looking
for a relationship.

19:54.427 --> 19:55.695
So we can still
work together,

19:55.728 --> 19:59.432
we can still be friends,
but...

19:59.466 --> 20:01.434
Okay?

20:01.468 --> 20:05.272
So my looks
having nothing to do with it.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.712
Jan is not in a place
where she feels

20:12.745 --> 20:14.547
she can have a relationship
right now.

20:14.581 --> 20:17.417
And it doesn't matter
how great a guy I am.

20:17.450 --> 20:19.986
And that is all I needed.

20:20.019 --> 20:23.323
I'm good.
I can go home now.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.868
Hey, it's 12:20.
Where the hell is Dwight?

20:35.902 --> 20:38.538
Um, no idea.

20:38.571 --> 20:41.240
Never missed a day
my ass.

20:49.849 --> 20:53.553
I'm here! I'm here!

20:55.688 --> 20:57.690
I'm here! It's okay!
