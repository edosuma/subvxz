[Gasps]

00:27.701 --> 00:28.501
[Gasps]

00:30.370 --> 00:34.488
Richard, it pains me to admit
it, but I am in your debt.

00:34.508 --> 00:37.081
Yes. Deeply. But if you'd like
to start paying rent...

00:37.101 --> 00:39.845
No, no, no. I mean I owe you
a debt of gratitude.

00:39.880 --> 00:40.813
Oh.

00:40.847 --> 00:42.782
If you had not urged me

00:42.816 --> 00:44.350
to take this audition,

00:44.385 --> 00:47.019
I would never have gotten
this part.

00:47.053 --> 00:49.755
Now I'm off
to my wardrobe fitting.

00:49.790 --> 00:51.156
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:51.190 --> 00:52.605
- Bye.
- Castle: Bye.

00:52.625 --> 00:53.793
Where are you off to?

00:53.827 --> 00:56.462
Oh, I signed up for an escort service.
I have to meet a client.

00:56.496 --> 00:57.663
What? A what?

00:57.697 --> 00:58.867
[Chuckles]

00:58.887 --> 01:00.866
I just wanted to see
if you were listening.

01:00.901 --> 01:01.560
[Laughs]

01:01.580 --> 01:03.936
I'm going to the library
to study.

01:03.970 --> 01:04.970
Not cool.

01:05.004 --> 01:06.338
Bye, Kate.

01:06.372 --> 01:08.006
Oh. Bye, bud.

01:09.208 --> 01:11.209
A goodbye kiss?
When did that start?

01:12.290 --> 01:13.645
[Door opens]
Just now.

01:13.679 --> 01:15.380
Yeah, no, I'm as surprised
as you are.

01:15.415 --> 01:17.049
Well, I don't know
if I'm surprised.

01:17.083 --> 01:18.716
[Door closes] I mean,
you are pretty lovable.

01:18.751 --> 01:21.185
Well, you raised
a great person, so...

01:21.219 --> 01:23.006
Mm. You say that now. You
weren't here for the beginning.

01:23.026 --> 01:24.793
Next time, I will be.

01:24.813 --> 01:26.123
Next time?

01:26.158 --> 01:28.660
Are you saying that
you're thinking about...

01:28.694 --> 01:32.063
Yeah. About it, about my job,
about whether we're ready,

01:32.097 --> 01:33.998
if there's ever a right time.

01:34.032 --> 01:36.733
There never is, but there's
never a wrong time, either.

01:36.768 --> 01:37.901
[Cellphone rings]

01:37.936 --> 01:39.570
- Except maybe now.
- Really.

01:39.604 --> 01:41.477
Okay, we'll talk about it later.

01:42.507 --> 01:43.774
Beckett.

01:45.919 --> 01:47.178
So, who found the body?

01:47.212 --> 01:48.079
Homeless guy, Ed Turner.

01:48.113 --> 01:50.214
Said he found her
in this recycling bin

01:50.248 --> 01:51.715
when he was scavenging
for bottles.

01:51.749 --> 01:53.249
We get Turner's statement?

01:53.284 --> 01:54.751
No, we haven't found him yet.

01:54.786 --> 01:56.920
He called 911
from a nearby payphone,

01:56.955 --> 01:59.155
but when we got here,
he was already gone.

01:59.190 --> 02:01.191
Obviously, she's
not carrying I.D.

02:01.225 --> 02:04.260
So, uh... I'm guessing
we don't know who she is?

02:04.295 --> 02:05.729
Hopefully we will in a minute.

02:05.763 --> 02:07.498
In the meantime, I can give you

02:07.532 --> 02:10.265
a pretty good idea
of how she died.

02:10.300 --> 02:11.701
Manual strangulation.

02:11.735 --> 02:14.004
Probably 24 to 36 hours ago.

02:14.038 --> 02:15.671
Based on lividity,

02:15.706 --> 02:18.375
she was put in the dumpster
right after she was killed.

02:20.311 --> 02:22.678
Beckett: Abrasions on her feet.

02:22.713 --> 02:24.180
Mud spatter on her legs.

02:24.215 --> 02:26.601
She was running.
Someone was chasing her.

02:26.621 --> 02:28.050
And then caught her, killed her,

02:28.084 --> 02:29.284
and stuffed her in that dumpster
over there.

02:29.319 --> 02:30.720
And she's wearing a nightgown.

02:30.754 --> 02:32.121
She couldn't have come
from very far.

02:32.155 --> 02:33.856
I'll have unis
show her photo around,

02:33.891 --> 02:35.391
try to find someone
who recognizes her.

02:35.425 --> 02:36.859
Canvass... see if there are
any witnesses

02:36.894 --> 02:38.060
who might have seen
what happened.

02:38.094 --> 02:39.160
Okay.

02:43.569 --> 02:45.095
Lanie, are you okay?

02:45.554 --> 02:46.701
Yeah.

02:46.736 --> 02:50.658
It's just something about her...
something familiar.

02:51.274 --> 02:52.741
What, like you know her?

02:52.775 --> 02:55.110
No, I definitely don't know her.

02:55.634 --> 02:58.327
If she's in the system,
we can find out who she is.

02:59.348 --> 03:02.190
[Device beeping]

03:02.463 --> 03:05.286
Ryan: Susan Watts...
born in Vestal, New York.

03:05.320 --> 03:07.121
High-school dropout.

03:07.156 --> 03:08.213
Multiple arrests...

03:08.233 --> 03:10.876
check kiting, petty larceny,
bust for possession.

03:10.896 --> 03:12.319
The last one got her sent
to Albion,

03:12.339 --> 03:13.932
but she was released
six months ago.

03:13.952 --> 03:15.563
Anything since then?

03:15.597 --> 03:17.921
No, that was her last-known
contact with law enforcement.

03:17.941 --> 03:19.133
What about known associates?

03:19.168 --> 03:20.668
Maybe she was hanging out
with someone

03:20.702 --> 03:22.770
- that knows who killed her.
- No associates listed,

03:22.804 --> 03:24.672
but I do have Susan Watts'
address.

03:24.706 --> 03:26.407
[Knock on door]

03:28.467 --> 03:30.844
- Can I help you?
- Detective Beckett, NYPD.

03:30.879 --> 03:33.346
I need to ask you a few
questions about Susan Watts.

03:33.381 --> 03:35.415
Why? Did something happen?

03:37.851 --> 03:39.377
I quit smoking seven years ago,

03:39.397 --> 03:40.891
and I really want a cigarette
right now.

03:40.911 --> 03:44.513
Katrina, when was the last time
you saw Susan or talked to her?

03:44.533 --> 03:47.227
Maybe three months ago,
about the time she moved out.

03:47.261 --> 03:48.261
She moved out?

03:48.296 --> 03:49.725
Where'd she go?

03:49.985 --> 03:51.965
I don't know.
She didn't stay here long.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.133
Less than six months.

03:53.168 --> 03:55.635
Did she have any friends,
boyfriends,

03:55.670 --> 03:57.637
people that she partied with?

03:57.672 --> 04:00.459
Susan wasn't like that.
Not anymore.

04:01.601 --> 04:04.644
I posted an ad looking for
a roommate, and she answered.

04:04.679 --> 04:07.747
She was up front
that she used to be an addict,

04:07.781 --> 04:09.080
been in prison.

04:09.100 --> 04:11.418
But she swore she was done
with all that.

04:11.452 --> 04:13.553
She actually turned out to be
the dream roommate.

04:13.588 --> 04:14.554
Go figure.

04:14.589 --> 04:16.289
And why did she move out?

04:16.324 --> 04:18.437
She got some great new job.

04:18.846 --> 04:20.659
- What kind of job?
- I'm not sure,

04:20.694 --> 04:21.793
but all of a sudden,

04:21.829 --> 04:24.230
she could afford great clothes
and a way nicer place,

04:24.264 --> 04:26.099
so off she went.
I was happy for her.

04:26.133 --> 04:29.282
Seemed like she had really
turned her life around.

04:29.555 --> 04:30.970
What else can you tell me
about this new job?

04:31.004 --> 04:32.338
Who did she work for?

04:32.372 --> 04:33.836
She never told me.

04:33.856 --> 04:36.443
She was actually kind of
secretive about it.

04:42.412 --> 04:45.083
So, the canvass
is coming up empty.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.519
There's no sign of ed Turner,
dude who called 911.

04:47.554 --> 04:49.488
No witnesses, and no one
who knows Susan Watts,

04:49.522 --> 04:50.723
which is weird,

04:50.757 --> 04:53.825
because why would she be running
down that alley in her jams

04:53.860 --> 04:55.193
if she didn't live
in the neighborhood?

04:55.228 --> 04:56.194
You know what else is weird?

04:56.229 --> 04:58.263
I can't find anything
on this job that she had.

04:58.297 --> 04:59.697
No w-2s or 1099s?

04:59.732 --> 05:01.833
Or social security withholding,

05:01.868 --> 05:03.969
so she must've been paid
in cash.

05:04.003 --> 05:05.103
So maybe her job was illegal,

05:05.138 --> 05:06.606
and that might be part
of the reason she was killed.

05:06.626 --> 05:10.040
The only reference I found
regarding employment

05:10.075 --> 05:12.109
was a place called
Newstart Horizons.

05:12.144 --> 05:13.378
Sounds like a diet plan.

05:13.412 --> 05:14.879
[Chuckles] You would think so,

05:14.913 --> 05:16.847
uh, but it's a job-placement
organization

05:16.882 --> 05:18.449
for women who've been
incarcerated

05:18.484 --> 05:19.450
based right here in the city.

05:19.485 --> 05:22.019
Susan met with them when
they visited the prison.

05:22.053 --> 05:22.953
So maybe they placed her
in that job,

05:22.988 --> 05:23.888
and they might know
where she moved to.

05:23.922 --> 05:26.390
I'll loop Beckett in
on Newstart Horizons.

05:26.424 --> 05:28.525
[Cellphone vibrates]

05:31.329 --> 05:32.897
Hey.

05:32.931 --> 05:34.031
Hey.

05:34.065 --> 05:35.299
So, what's up?

05:35.333 --> 05:36.566
Well, for one thing,

05:36.601 --> 05:38.735
I found this
in the victim's hair.

05:38.770 --> 05:41.038
Feather.

05:41.072 --> 05:43.850
Probably from bedding
or a down pillow or something.

05:44.234 --> 05:46.743
So maybe she was in bed and got
chased out of her house.

05:46.778 --> 05:48.912
Killer could've been somebody
she knew, maybe a boyfriend.

05:48.946 --> 05:51.047
What's the story
with this woman?

05:51.081 --> 05:52.482
Why do you ask?

05:52.517 --> 05:54.150
Is it something like this?

05:54.185 --> 05:56.386
She was in trouble with the law,

05:56.421 --> 05:59.555
then she gets her act together,
finds a great job,

05:59.589 --> 06:02.692
but damned if you can figure out
what that job is.

06:02.726 --> 06:04.093
How do you know that?

06:04.128 --> 06:06.381
Do you remember Pam Hodges?

06:06.902 --> 06:08.932
Yeah. How could I forget her?

06:09.558 --> 06:10.766
She looked just like you.

06:10.801 --> 06:12.668
That's how she was made to look.

06:12.703 --> 06:14.437
Pam Hodges had the same story,

06:14.471 --> 06:16.104
except she was a hooker
in Tampa.

06:16.139 --> 06:19.107
Out of nowhere, she gets herself
straightened out,

06:19.142 --> 06:21.944
gets a great job,
then gets killed... strangled.

06:21.978 --> 06:24.046
Yeah, but not in the same way.

06:24.080 --> 06:26.915
Pam was strangled with wire
by Carl Matthews,

06:26.950 --> 06:28.351
but we put him away.

06:28.385 --> 06:31.318
So, what does Pam Hodges
have to do with Susan Watts?

06:34.490 --> 06:37.059
I think they're connected.

06:38.105 --> 06:41.129
Excuse me.
Hi, I'm Detective Beckett, NYPD.

06:41.164 --> 06:42.430
I need to speak with someone

06:42.465 --> 06:44.132
about one of your clients,
Susan Watts.

06:44.167 --> 06:46.068
Let me contact the director.

06:46.102 --> 06:47.702
Okay. [Cellphone rings]

06:47.737 --> 06:49.808
Uh... Excuse me.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.940
Lanie, hey, what do you got?

06:52.975 --> 06:53.679
Lanie: I'm here with Javi,

06:53.699 --> 06:55.566
and I think I know why
Susan Watts looked familiar.

06:55.586 --> 06:58.813
She had cosmetic surgery
on her face.

06:58.848 --> 07:00.050
Way less extreme,

07:00.070 --> 07:02.515
but a lot like
what Pam Hodges had done.

07:02.800 --> 07:03.960
Pam Hodges?

07:03.980 --> 07:06.603
It's the same cheek implants,
the same technique.

07:06.623 --> 07:08.956
Kate, I think
Susan Watts' surgery

07:08.991 --> 07:10.925
was performed
by the same doctor.

07:10.959 --> 07:12.493
Dr. Kelly Nieman?

07:12.527 --> 07:14.595
Kelly: Please,
let me offer you a pen.

07:14.629 --> 07:15.529
No. Thank you.

07:15.563 --> 07:17.398
We're just here to ask you
a few questions.

07:17.432 --> 07:21.666
Oh, can I just say, you have
an amazing face, detective.

07:23.772 --> 07:26.339
I can't prove it, but my gut
says this is Nieman's work.

07:26.374 --> 07:29.109
She was in on the murders of
Pam Hodges and Daniel Santos,

07:29.143 --> 07:31.144
and you could never
nail her for it.

07:31.178 --> 07:33.282
Maybe this time you can.

07:34.716 --> 07:36.082
Kate, are you still there?

07:36.117 --> 07:39.119
Lanie, uh,
it's not just your gut.

07:40.733 --> 07:43.323
Kelly Nieman is a part of this,
and I'm looking right at her.

07:49.473 --> 07:51.694
S07E14
Resurrection

07:51.714 --> 07:54.511
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

07:55.294 --> 07:57.442
Wait... Kelly Nieman
is mixed up in this?

07:57.462 --> 07:59.742
- I thought she left the country.
- Beckett: She's back.

07:59.762 --> 08:01.631
Though the director
at Newstart Horizons

08:01.665 --> 08:03.765
claims that Dr. Nieman
never met Susan Watts.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.252
Only now Susan is dead,

08:05.272 --> 08:07.950
and Kelly Nieman is a major
donor of Newstart Horizons.

08:07.970 --> 08:09.672
Yeah, it can't be a coincidence.

08:09.706 --> 08:10.739
What can I do?

08:10.774 --> 08:13.019
Just stay close to the phone.
I'll be in touch.

08:15.390 --> 08:16.884
Gates: Kate, how sure are you

08:16.904 --> 08:19.848
that Kelly Nieman is connected
with the Susan Watts case?

08:19.882 --> 08:21.119
A lot of things point
to her, sir.

08:21.139 --> 08:23.547
As it did with Pam Hodges
and Daniel Santos,

08:23.567 --> 08:25.202
but no actual proof.

08:25.222 --> 08:27.482
At the time, you felt that 3XK

08:27.502 --> 08:29.232
might have played a part
in those murders.

08:29.252 --> 08:31.106
Do you think he played a part
in this one, too?

08:31.126 --> 08:33.976
I don't have any evidence
of it yet, sir,

08:33.996 --> 08:36.831
and we haven't found
any actual proof

08:36.865 --> 08:39.066
that Jerry Tyson is still alive.

08:39.100 --> 08:41.434
It's possible that Kelly Nieman

08:41.469 --> 08:43.236
is a serial killer
in her own right.

08:44.369 --> 08:46.173
She's as shrewd
and high functioning

08:46.207 --> 08:47.975
of a sociopath as he ever was.

08:48.010 --> 08:50.411
If Dr. Nieman is involved
in this murder,

08:50.445 --> 08:52.006
how can I make sure

08:52.026 --> 08:54.682
that she doesn't slip
through our fingers again?

08:55.116 --> 08:57.017
You could bring Castle in
to consult on this case.

08:57.052 --> 08:58.919
No, detective.

08:58.953 --> 09:01.643
Sir, he knows the Nieman case
inside and out.

09:01.916 --> 09:03.524
He could be a huge asset.

09:03.558 --> 09:06.473
Well, I am inclined to agree
with you, but...

09:09.228 --> 09:11.330
Mr. Castle...

09:11.672 --> 09:14.167
works on this case only.

09:14.201 --> 09:16.002
Thank you, sir.

09:16.037 --> 09:17.136
Don't thank me yet.

09:17.171 --> 09:19.205

on board.

09:19.239 --> 09:20.506
Ryan: Excuse me, captain.

09:20.541 --> 09:22.208
We looked into Kelly Nieman.

09:22.242 --> 09:24.343
She has a surgical clinic
in Costa Rica,

09:24.378 --> 09:27.580
but she also began seeing
patients right here in this city

09:27.614 --> 09:30.216
six months ago through
a cosmetic surgery group.

09:30.250 --> 09:31.117
Where?

09:31.137 --> 09:33.786
St. Simon's hospital,
eighth floor.

[Elevator bell dings]

09:50.269 --> 09:52.237
Beckett:
Pam Hodges was murdered,

09:52.271 --> 09:53.305
and so was Daniel Santos,

09:53.339 --> 09:55.741
and the only person that
they have in common is you.

09:55.775 --> 09:58.611
What possible motive would I
have for killing anyone?

09:58.645 --> 10:00.412
Ryan: She volunteered
as a prison doctor.

10:00.446 --> 10:02.680
Not only that,
she treated Jerry Tyson.

10:02.715 --> 10:04.082
She's got to be
Tyson's girlfriend.

10:04.117 --> 10:05.450
He taught her everything
he knew.

10:05.485 --> 10:09.190
Esposito: We got here too late.
Nieman cleared out. She's gone.

all figured out, but you don't.

What skilled hands
could do with you.

10:55.066 --> 10:56.834
I'm not interested
in a consultation.

10:56.868 --> 10:58.301
Neither am I.

10:58.336 --> 11:01.137
You do know your little theory
that I played a role

11:01.172 --> 11:04.570
in those deaths damaged
my practice, my reputation.

11:06.477 --> 11:08.711
But I can truly say that's all
in the past now

11:08.746 --> 11:09.846
and I bear you no malice.

11:09.881 --> 11:12.015
Well, that's a relief.

11:12.049 --> 11:14.425
What can you tell me
about Susan Watts?

11:14.772 --> 11:16.286
I'm not familiar with that name.

11:16.320 --> 11:17.720
She was a client
at Newstart Horizons.

11:17.755 --> 11:18.889
Many women are.

11:18.923 --> 11:20.523
So you never met her there?

11:20.557 --> 11:22.825
I donate to Newstart Horizons,
detective,

11:22.860 --> 11:24.794
but it's not where
I spend my time,

11:24.828 --> 11:26.543
and I don't know Susan Watts.

11:26.803 --> 11:28.901
Does this refresh your memory?

11:30.100 --> 11:32.001
She got a job that apparently
doesn't exist.

11:32.035 --> 11:34.871
She also had cosmetic surgery
performed by you.

11:34.905 --> 11:36.572
You must be mistaken.

11:36.607 --> 11:39.909
I never forget a face,
especially if I cut it.

11:39.943 --> 11:41.877
So I suppose you won't mind
if I take a look

11:41.912 --> 11:44.079
at your patient records
just to be sure.

11:44.114 --> 11:45.847
Of course not.

11:45.882 --> 11:48.050
I just need to see a court order
signed by a judge.

11:48.084 --> 11:49.359
I'll get one.

11:49.379 --> 11:51.086
Not based on casual suspicions,

11:51.121 --> 11:52.854
which is all you seem to have.

11:54.854 --> 11:55.990
I'll be back.

11:56.025 --> 11:57.771

12:13.976 --> 12:15.055
What's up, Beckett?

12:15.075 --> 12:16.594
Kelly Nieman just denied
knowing Susan Watts,

12:16.614 --> 12:19.780
- and I need proof that she's lying.
- Well, I haven't found any yet.

12:19.815 --> 12:21.449
But so far,
nobody at Newstart Horizons

12:21.483 --> 12:22.750
remembers seeing them together,

12:22.784 --> 12:25.619
and there's no forensic evidence
that ties Nieman to the murder.

12:25.654 --> 12:27.055
Put a surveillance detail
on her,

12:27.089 --> 12:30.257
and pull security video
from St. Simon's hospital.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.526
Maybe Susan visited Nieman here

12:32.561 --> 12:34.094
or came in for an appointment.

12:34.128 --> 12:35.329
I'll get right on it,

12:35.363 --> 12:37.531
but you're talking about weeks
of footage to comb through,

12:37.566 --> 12:39.600
and that's even if St. Simon's
lets us have it.

12:39.634 --> 12:41.068
But I do have some good news
for you.

12:41.102 --> 12:42.135
What?

12:42.170 --> 12:43.704
The D.A. signed off on Castle

12:43.738 --> 12:44.871
working this case with us.

12:44.905 --> 12:47.645
He'll be here ready to jump in
by the time you get back.

12:50.011 --> 12:52.479
Do you really think Nieman's
behind Susan Watts' murder?

12:52.513 --> 12:55.626
Couldn't tell. She's got
ice water in her veins.

12:55.813 --> 12:57.250
Although I'll bet Kelly Nieman

12:57.285 --> 12:58.986
wasn't in the alleyway
doing the dirty work.

12:59.020 --> 13:00.454
Last time,
she had an accomplice,

13:00.488 --> 13:03.389
a proxy... someone who did
the killing for her.

13:03.423 --> 13:05.658
So, who's the proxy this time?

13:05.693 --> 13:08.127
Hey, guys. We got something.

13:08.161 --> 13:10.262
The hospital won't share
security footage

13:10.297 --> 13:11.564
without a court order.

13:11.599 --> 13:13.666
But I was able to locate
a street cam

13:13.701 --> 13:15.301
with a view of
the hospital entrance.

13:15.335 --> 13:17.003
So, we started
rolling through it,

13:17.037 --> 13:19.232
and in no time,
we ran across this.

13:19.703 --> 13:23.078
Beckett: She's carrying
a Kelly Nieman gift bag.

13:23.643 --> 13:26.278
Well, that's her.
That's definitely Susan Watts.

13:26.313 --> 13:28.014
Except there's
a timeline problem.

13:28.048 --> 13:29.848
This footage is from
yesterday afternoon.

13:29.883 --> 13:32.184
After Susan Watts
was already dead,

13:32.219 --> 13:34.517
so this can't be her.

13:35.187 --> 13:37.222
- That's not Susan Watts?
- Mnh-mnh.

13:38.958 --> 13:41.527
All right, then either
by some insane coincidence,

13:41.561 --> 13:43.361
Kelly Nieman has another patient

13:43.396 --> 13:45.497
who looks exactly
like Susan Watts...

13:45.532 --> 13:48.133
Or Nieman surgically changed
that woman

13:48.167 --> 13:49.968
to look like Susan Watts
for some reason.

13:50.003 --> 13:53.738
Either way, we've got to figure
out where this woman is.

13:55.974 --> 13:57.542
Oh, my God.

13:57.576 --> 13:58.676
Look who's driving.

13:58.710 --> 14:00.445
It's 3XK.

14:04.569 --> 14:06.021
He's alive.

14:09.558 --> 14:11.102

14:11.122 --> 14:12.973
This woman is in grave danger.

14:12.993 --> 14:14.994
She left St. Simon's
hospital yesterday,

14:15.028 --> 14:16.663
and we urgently need
to find her.

14:16.697 --> 14:18.598
She is a patient
of Dr. Kelly Nieman.

14:18.632 --> 14:19.966
Nieman is not cooperating,

14:20.000 --> 14:21.300
so canvass the hospital.

14:21.335 --> 14:23.302
Someone there has to know
who she is.

14:23.337 --> 14:24.470
And work this vehicle.

14:24.504 --> 14:26.296
We find the truck,
we find the woman

14:26.316 --> 14:28.306
along with the man
she took a ride with.

14:28.326 --> 14:31.844
That man is Jerry Tyson,
also known as 3XK.

14:31.879 --> 14:33.846
And I am sure that no one here

14:33.881 --> 14:36.448
is more familiar
with him than Castle.

A...dubious distinction.

14:40.273 --> 14:42.320
3XK, the triple killer.

14:42.355 --> 14:45.924
So named because he kills his
victims in groups of three...

blondes like his latest victim,
Susan Watts.

14:48.384 --> 14:51.266
The original 3XK killings
were unsolved

14:51.286 --> 14:53.699
and stopped
soon after they started.

14:53.733 --> 14:56.502
But then four years ago,
another victim showed up.

is Marcus Gates.

15:02.627 --> 15:04.442

15:04.476 --> 15:08.146
Now, we couldn't prove
that Marcus Gates was 3XK.

15:08.180 --> 15:11.216
But his cellmate, Jerry Tyson,
agreed to help us put Gates away

15:11.250 --> 15:12.951
in exchange
for an early release.

15:12.985 --> 15:15.352
That turned out to be
not such a good deal.

15:15.387 --> 15:17.488
It's not Marcus Gates.

15:17.523 --> 15:20.181
It was him all along.
He's the real triple killer.

15:22.861 --> 15:23.895
[Gun cocks]

15:24.333 --> 15:27.632
By the time we realized
that Jerry Tyson was 3XK,

15:27.666 --> 15:28.966
it was too late.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.067
We got close again

15:30.101 --> 15:33.137
when Tyson used the gun he stole
from Detective Ryan

15:33.171 --> 15:35.806
in a homicide,
then he dropped out of sight.

15:35.840 --> 15:37.474
But not for long.

15:37.508 --> 15:39.043
Esposito: Richard Castle,

15:39.077 --> 15:41.545
you're under arrest for
the murder of Tessa Horton.

15:41.579 --> 15:43.247
You did this.
Y-you killed Tessa.

15:43.281 --> 15:44.881
You killed Tessa.

15:44.916 --> 15:48.051
You will not last the night.

15:50.387 --> 15:51.521
Castle: He's not dead.

15:51.556 --> 15:53.957
You shot him.
He's dead. It's over.

15:55.225 --> 15:56.803
For now.

15:58.379 --> 16:01.878
I wish I could say my doubts
were unfounded.

16:02.433 --> 16:05.165
Why would someone kill clones
of Esposito and Lanie?

16:05.185 --> 16:08.255
Beckett: Kelly Nieman
is playing a much deeper game.

16:08.275 --> 16:09.839
Where are the 3XK files?

16:09.873 --> 16:10.806
I didn't check out any files.

16:10.841 --> 16:13.509
It's not just Tyson's files
that are gone.

16:13.543 --> 16:16.012
Lab work, DNA, tissue samples

16:16.046 --> 16:20.783
of every 3XK victim
were checked out by Lanie.

16:20.817 --> 16:22.417
Only not the real Lanie.

16:22.452 --> 16:23.452
Now, at the time,

16:23.487 --> 16:26.355
we weren't certain that Tyson
was behind it all.

16:26.389 --> 16:29.625
We didn't even know if he was
alive, but we do now.

16:29.659 --> 16:31.859
Beckett:
But we might have gotten lucky.

16:32.206 --> 16:34.563
It looks like Susan Watts
escaped from Tyson,

16:34.598 --> 16:36.598
forcing him to kill her
in the alley

16:36.632 --> 16:38.233
and leave her body there,

16:38.267 --> 16:40.602
which means he got careless,
he made mistakes.

16:40.636 --> 16:42.704
Let's press our advantage
and find this woman

16:42.738 --> 16:45.158
before she becomes
his next victim.

16:49.178 --> 16:50.745
You look well, Mr. Castle.

16:50.779 --> 16:54.763
Though your palpebral folds
could use some tending.

16:54.783 --> 16:56.784
I thought you stopped
working on cases.

16:56.819 --> 16:58.586
For you, I made an exception.

16:58.621 --> 17:01.455
Please know I'm here
as a courtesy.

17:01.490 --> 17:04.458
I'm sure you are.
Um, who is this woman?

17:04.492 --> 17:06.394
And don't say
you don't know her.

17:06.428 --> 17:08.596
She is carrying your swag bag.

17:08.631 --> 17:10.464
That doesn't prove
she's a patient.

17:10.499 --> 17:12.333
Are you saying
she's not a patient?

17:12.367 --> 17:14.679
I'm saying I can't answer that.
I'd be breaking confidentiality.

17:14.699 --> 17:18.070
Which you would be free to do,
even obliged to do,

17:18.090 --> 17:20.508
especially if a patient's life
is in danger.

17:20.541 --> 17:22.108

with Jerry Tyson.

17:22.144 --> 17:23.676
It doesn't get more dangerous
than that.

17:23.711 --> 17:26.445
Except Jerry Tyson is dead.
Therefore, that can't be him.

17:26.480 --> 17:27.681
Beckett: Really?

17:27.714 --> 17:31.084
Then who is he,
and where do we find him?

17:31.118 --> 17:33.119
I really couldn't say.

17:33.591 --> 17:35.713
I know why you're here.

17:36.085 --> 17:39.192
To see what we have.

17:39.489 --> 17:41.834
What you have is irrelevant
to me.

17:42.070 --> 17:43.996
I'm innocent of any wrongdoing.

17:44.031 --> 17:44.997
If you're innocent,

17:45.032 --> 17:47.162
then why won't you give us
this woman's name?

17:47.182 --> 17:49.135
Especially when not giving it

17:49.170 --> 17:51.003
makes you look guilty.

17:51.038 --> 17:54.374
Any judge we take this to will
see this man is Jerry Tyson.

17:54.671 --> 17:58.378
We will be granted a court order
for that patient's name.

17:58.412 --> 17:59.812
So you can give it to me now,

17:59.846 --> 18:01.981
or I'll see you in an hour
in your hospital

18:02.015 --> 18:03.716
with a dozen police officers.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.484
Your choice.

18:08.689 --> 18:10.122
Her name is Amy Barrett.

18:10.829 --> 18:12.914
Run that name. Go.

18:13.694 --> 18:16.462
Beckett: So you admit that Amy
Barrett is a patient of yours.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.029
Where does she live?

18:18.064 --> 18:20.566
I'll have my office send
her contact information.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.783
Why did she want surgery?

18:23.106 --> 18:25.228
She wanted to enhance
her appearance.

18:25.248 --> 18:27.172
And it's just
an amazing coincidence

18:27.207 --> 18:29.601
she ended up looking
exactly like Susan Watts?

18:29.621 --> 18:31.543
As I've said before,
I don't know who that is.

18:31.578 --> 18:33.484
And yet they look identical.

18:34.774 --> 18:37.181
Whatever you're up to,

18:37.216 --> 18:39.974
whatever Tyson is up to,

18:40.620 --> 18:41.853
we will stop it.

18:41.887 --> 18:44.756
Jerry Tyson is dead.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.186
And I have a surgery scheduled.

18:49.595 --> 18:51.695
Contact info that Kelly Nieman's
office sent us

18:51.730 --> 18:52.630
was out of date.

18:52.664 --> 18:53.998
Amy moved out of her place
two months ago.

18:54.032 --> 18:55.533
Still trying
to figure out where.

18:55.567 --> 18:56.601
Just like Susan Watts.

18:56.635 --> 18:58.202
That's not all she had
in common.

18:58.237 --> 19:00.505
Amy Barrett grew up in Arizona.
Ran away at 16.

19:00.539 --> 19:02.273
She drifted around.
Multiple arrests.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.674
She have any connection
to Newstart Horizons?

19:03.708 --> 19:05.413
Not that I can tell.

19:07.045 --> 19:09.046
Nieman's creating his victims.

19:09.080 --> 19:10.614
What do you mean?

19:10.649 --> 19:11.749
For Jerry Tyson.

19:11.783 --> 19:13.583
They're like clones.

19:14.710 --> 19:16.620
They're blond and pretty,

19:16.655 --> 19:17.955
just the way Tyson likes them.

19:17.989 --> 19:19.523
Nieman finds these poor women,

19:19.557 --> 19:21.191
lost souls that
no one is gonna miss,

19:21.225 --> 19:22.692
and she remakes them.

19:22.726 --> 19:24.827
She grooms them for 3XK.

19:27.349 --> 19:29.136
Esposito: Yo. We got the truck.

19:29.156 --> 19:30.600
Tory picked it up
on another street cam.

19:30.635 --> 19:31.828
Got a license plate.

19:31.848 --> 19:33.970
Vehicle belongs to a guy
named Michael Boudreau.

19:34.844 --> 19:36.273
We got an address?

19:36.307 --> 19:37.740
Yeah, four blocks from where
Susan Watts was found.

19:37.775 --> 19:39.038
Let's go.

19:39.058 --> 19:40.743
This is definitely the place.

19:40.778 --> 19:42.712
How do you think
Michael Boudreau figures in?

19:42.746 --> 19:44.747
He may be Tyson's accomplice.

19:50.932 --> 19:53.923
Michael Boudreau, NYPD!
Open the door!

19:53.957 --> 19:56.258
[Thudding]

19:58.161 --> 20:00.229
Freeze! NYPD!

20:00.263 --> 20:02.516
Let me see your hands!
Step away from the window.

20:03.471 --> 20:05.122
Turn around.

20:10.214 --> 20:12.808
Jerry Tyson,
you are under arrest.

20:18.495 --> 20:21.164
What I wouldn't give to be
in that box with Jerry Tyson.

20:21.198 --> 20:22.998
Well, we arrested him.

20:23.032 --> 20:25.434
He's going away.
I'm good with that.

20:25.468 --> 20:26.769
Yeah, but he didn't
take your gun

20:26.803 --> 20:28.003
and get someone killed with it.

20:28.469 --> 20:31.039
Yeah.
[Cellphone rings]

20:31.073 --> 20:32.007
[Cellphone beeps]

20:32.254 --> 20:33.442
Ryan.

20:33.476 --> 20:35.444
Did you find any sign
of Amy Barrett?

20:35.478 --> 20:37.813
Not yet, but CSU's pulling
prints to see if she was here.

20:37.847 --> 20:40.448
They're also checking bedding
and pillows

20:40.482 --> 20:42.150
to see if it matches
that feather

20:42.185 --> 20:43.847
that Lanie found
in Susan Watts' hair.

20:43.867 --> 20:45.653
Well, what's the story
on Michael Boudreau?

20:45.688 --> 20:48.405
Well, based on his pay stubs
and some other stuff,

20:48.425 --> 20:50.158
he came from Iowa
six months ago.

20:50.192 --> 20:51.427
Works in construction.

20:51.461 --> 20:53.395
- Well, where is he now?
- We don't know.

20:53.430 --> 20:55.263
We also don't know
his connection

20:55.298 --> 20:56.597
to Jerry Tyson, either.

20:56.632 --> 20:57.799
All right, uh, keep me posted.

20:57.833 --> 20:59.334
Yes, sir.

20:59.368 --> 21:01.621
Yo, Ryan. Check it out.

21:02.304 --> 21:04.215
Found this under the bed.

21:04.473 --> 21:06.039
Look at the photo.

21:08.856 --> 21:09.911
Amy Barrett.

21:09.946 --> 21:11.446
Because it's her phone.

21:11.480 --> 21:12.647
She was here.

21:12.681 --> 21:15.631
Question is, where is she now
and what did Tyson do to her?

21:28.746 --> 21:30.697
I never thought this day
would come.

21:30.731 --> 21:33.367
Not only can we prove
Jerry Tyson is alive,

21:33.401 --> 21:34.969
but we have him in custody.

21:35.003 --> 21:37.957
What we don't have
is a smoking gun.

21:38.887 --> 21:39.873
There's no evidence
at the apartment?

21:39.907 --> 21:41.308
Nothing to indicate foul play,

21:41.343 --> 21:43.110
and we can't charge him
for his past crimes,

21:43.144 --> 21:44.478
not with his records missing.

21:44.512 --> 21:46.754
We have him at the motel.

21:47.188 --> 21:48.782
He attacked Ryan.

21:48.816 --> 21:50.444
He tied me up at gunpoint.

21:50.464 --> 21:53.019
Kidnapping, the aggravated
assault of a police officer,

21:53.053 --> 21:54.955
and use of a gun
during a felony.

21:54.989 --> 21:57.081
That will work.

21:57.949 --> 21:59.526
Castle: So we got him.

21:59.560 --> 22:02.061
That'll buy us enough time
to tie him to Amy Barrett,

22:02.096 --> 22:03.863
Susan Watts, build a real case.

22:03.897 --> 22:06.394
We figured out how he might have
crossed paths with Amy.

22:06.414 --> 22:07.366
Before she came to New York,

22:07.401 --> 22:09.635
she was being treated
for substance abuse

22:09.670 --> 22:10.970
at a nonprofit clinic in Ohio.

22:11.005 --> 22:12.806
Don't tell me...
Kelly Nieman's a donor.

22:12.840 --> 22:13.907
To that organization

22:13.941 --> 22:16.475
and dozens of others just
like it across the country.

22:16.510 --> 22:18.436
She and Tyson
are in this together.

22:18.635 --> 22:19.679
Partners.

22:19.713 --> 22:21.647
A serial-killer team.

22:21.682 --> 22:23.549
She must have recruited
these women,

22:23.583 --> 22:26.519
promised them a great job,
a new look, and a bright future.

22:26.553 --> 22:28.821
Yeah, a future that ended
with Jerry Tyson.

22:28.855 --> 22:29.988
For all we know,

22:30.023 --> 22:32.858
she and Tyson have been doing
this for months, years.

22:32.892 --> 22:33.926
He probably got smart,

22:33.960 --> 22:36.628
disposed of the bodies
where we'd never find them.

22:36.662 --> 22:38.394
Until Susan Watts got away.

22:41.298 --> 22:43.902
We're gonna bring him down.
Nieman, too.

22:43.937 --> 22:44.903
Has he said anything yet?

22:44.938 --> 22:47.306
Not yet. But he's about to.

22:47.340 --> 22:48.614
[Door closes]

22:48.634 --> 22:50.375
Should really soak up
the ambiance.

22:50.409 --> 22:52.744
This is the nicest room you're
gonna be seeing for quite a while.

22:52.778 --> 22:54.479
If you say so.

22:54.513 --> 22:56.896
You were at the apartment.

22:57.750 --> 23:01.319
First time I saw a cop who was
a woman of your hotness.

23:01.354 --> 23:02.840
[Chuckles]

23:04.478 --> 23:06.657
The first time?
You don't know me?

23:07.448 --> 23:08.619
N-no.

23:08.639 --> 23:10.203
I don't know either one of you.

23:11.605 --> 23:12.997
Okay, fine, if you want
to play that game.

23:13.031 --> 23:14.665
This is Richard Castle.

23:14.699 --> 23:16.433
I'm Detective Beckett.

23:16.468 --> 23:17.768
How do you do, ma'am?

23:17.802 --> 23:20.071
Um... I got to be honest,

23:20.105 --> 23:21.572
this is a big misunderstanding.

23:21.606 --> 23:23.273
Then why did you try to run?

23:23.307 --> 23:24.608
Oh, I don't know.

23:24.642 --> 23:26.710
I'm sorry. I panicked, I guess.

23:26.745 --> 23:28.679
Honestly, I haven't always been
on the right side of the law.

23:28.713 --> 23:30.222
You don't say?

23:31.885 --> 23:33.250
Tell us about Amy Barrett.

23:33.284 --> 23:35.050
Oh, sweet girl.

23:35.360 --> 23:37.120
What was Amy doing
at the apartment?

23:37.154 --> 23:38.789
She stays there with me.

23:38.823 --> 23:39.923
What is she, your girlfriend?

23:39.957 --> 23:41.791
[Chuckles]

23:42.232 --> 23:45.628
I don't want to put a label
on what we have.

23:45.662 --> 23:46.596
Where is she now?

23:46.630 --> 23:48.298
Uh, I don't know.

23:48.332 --> 23:49.432
It's not like I keep tabs
on her.

23:49.466 --> 23:52.064
What about Susan Watts?
Is she your girlfriend, too?

23:53.168 --> 23:55.471
No.
I-I don't know her.

23:55.506 --> 23:56.739
Where's Michael Boudreau?

23:56.774 --> 23:59.742
[Laughs]

24:00.559 --> 24:02.384
What do you mean?

24:02.892 --> 24:05.915
Why were you at his apartment,
driving his truck?

24:05.949 --> 24:08.083
[Chuckles]

24:08.118 --> 24:11.220
Come on.
Man, I'm Michael Boudreau.

24:11.254 --> 24:13.422
You're Michael Boudreau?

24:13.456 --> 24:15.211
[Chuckling] Yeah.

24:16.675 --> 24:17.793
What?

24:17.827 --> 24:19.962
Yeah. Who...
who else would I be?

24:20.853 --> 24:22.975
Jerry Tyson.

24:23.409 --> 24:24.633
Oh.

24:27.628 --> 24:30.338
Y... I-I get that
from time to time.

24:30.372 --> 24:31.856
Yeah, well,
that's not surprising,

24:31.876 --> 24:34.462
considering you look
exactly like Tyson

24:34.482 --> 24:38.647
and nothing like this photo
of Michael Boudreau.

24:38.681 --> 24:41.126
So, why don't you explain that?

24:41.846 --> 24:43.323
[Sighs]

24:44.514 --> 24:47.822
Truth is I got
a little work done.

24:47.856 --> 24:52.367
You can still see
a teeny scar here.

24:53.422 --> 24:55.023
And here.

24:55.495 --> 24:58.304
- You got cosmetic surgery...
- Yeah.

24:58.324 --> 25:00.391
To look like a serial killer?

25:00.411 --> 25:04.004
I never liked how I looked,
and so I met this great surgeon,

25:04.024 --> 25:07.541
and she just [Chuckles]
gave me a new face.

25:07.576 --> 25:10.377
The funny thing is, I've never
felt more like myself

25:10.411 --> 25:12.346
since I started
looking like him.

25:12.380 --> 25:14.615
[Chuckles]

25:16.604 --> 25:18.685
It's weird, right?

25:18.719 --> 25:20.898
Was the surgeon Kelly Nieman?

25:23.053 --> 25:26.226
Yes. Man, she is the best.

25:26.701 --> 25:28.462
She even did a little
touch-up on Amy.

25:28.496 --> 25:30.797
You know, the problem is,
how are you gonna prove

25:30.831 --> 25:32.983
that you are Michael Boudreau?

25:33.901 --> 25:36.495
How do you prove I'm not?

25:41.099 --> 25:43.743
Detective.
An unexpected development.

25:43.777 --> 25:46.679
We only have one hard copy
of Tyson's fingerprints.

25:46.714 --> 25:48.314
Yeah, from the prison records...

25:48.348 --> 25:49.939
- the ones I had them send here.
- Right.

25:49.959 --> 25:51.917
But those prints
don't match the prints

25:51.951 --> 25:53.509
of the man we have in custody.

25:54.105 --> 25:55.687
That's impossible.

25:55.722 --> 25:57.990
Uh, when you ran the prints,
whose name came up?

25:58.025 --> 25:59.987
Michael Boudreau.

26:00.173 --> 26:02.828
We checked and rechecked.
There's no mistake.

26:02.862 --> 26:04.430
I know how he did it.

26:04.464 --> 26:06.832
Tyson killed Boudreau,
took his identity.

26:06.866 --> 26:10.502
Kelly Nieman grafted Boudreau's
fingertips onto Tyson's hands.

26:10.537 --> 26:12.838
The scars would've shown up
on his fingerprint card.

26:12.872 --> 26:15.073
Kelly Nieman's good enough
not to leave scars.

26:15.107 --> 26:16.775
Theories don't help us,
Mr. Castle.

26:16.809 --> 26:18.777
The D.A. just called.

26:18.811 --> 26:20.712
They heard from
Boudreau's lawyer,

26:20.747 --> 26:23.448
who says that we're keeping his
client under false pretenses.

26:23.482 --> 26:25.583
That's a lie, sir.
That man is Jerry Tyson.

26:25.617 --> 26:28.786
Then how do we prove it?
Not with Tyson's DNA sample.

26:28.820 --> 26:29.954
That's missing.

26:29.988 --> 26:32.090
And as far as the D.A.
is concerned,

26:32.124 --> 26:34.426
Tyson died when he went off
the bridge.

26:34.460 --> 26:35.760
This is why Tyson
had his case files

26:35.794 --> 26:36.894
and all his records taken...

26:36.929 --> 26:39.531
for a clean slate so he can kill
and get away with it.

26:39.565 --> 26:41.632
Are you saying that we have
to release that man, sir?

26:41.667 --> 26:43.233
Unless we can show
that he's Tyson

26:43.268 --> 26:45.736
or connect him to the murder,
I'm afraid we have to.

26:49.380 --> 26:51.628
- Ryan: You have to be kidding me.
- Beckett: I wish I was.

26:51.648 --> 26:52.976
Tyson's getting moved
to holding,

26:52.996 --> 26:55.309
but his next move might be
outside of this precinct.

26:55.329 --> 26:58.019
Unless we can tie him to a crime
or prove that he's Tyson.

26:58.039 --> 26:59.743
After all this guy's done,

26:59.763 --> 27:01.189
there's got to be something
we can do.

27:01.223 --> 27:03.024
Check the GPS on his truck.

27:03.058 --> 27:04.125
Let's find out where he's been,

27:04.159 --> 27:06.159
and pull all the phone records
from the apartment.

27:06.194 --> 27:07.227
We got to find something,

27:07.261 --> 27:08.762
anything that'll connect him
to Susan Watts' murder

27:08.797 --> 27:09.964
or Amy Barrett's disappearance.

27:09.998 --> 27:12.165
How much time do we have before
we have to cut him loose?

27:12.200 --> 27:13.601
Gates is trying
to stall the D.A.,

27:13.635 --> 27:14.835
so we got an hour, maybe two.

27:14.870 --> 27:16.504
Here we are not being able
to prove

27:16.538 --> 27:17.738
that Tyson is Tyson

27:17.772 --> 27:19.673
because we don't have his
DNA sample that he stole.

27:19.708 --> 27:22.675
Unless this guy
is Mike Boudreau.

27:22.710 --> 27:24.978
Could explain the fingerprints,
all he's been saying.

27:25.013 --> 27:26.813
Which would mean what?
That Tyson is actually dead

27:26.847 --> 27:29.782
and Kelly Nieman cut Boudreau
to look like Tyson?

27:29.817 --> 27:32.063
No. This guy is Jerry Tyson.

27:33.554 --> 27:35.355
I want to talk to him,
rattle him,

27:35.390 --> 27:36.789
get him to reveal himself.

27:36.824 --> 27:37.724
I'm with Castle.

27:37.758 --> 27:39.492
I don't think that man
is Michael Boudreau.

27:39.527 --> 27:40.426
Based on what?

27:40.460 --> 27:42.228
Once we I.D.'d Boudreau
and Amy Barrett,

27:42.262 --> 27:44.296
I started monitoring
their credit-card activity.

27:44.331 --> 27:45.532
Boudreau's card was just used

27:45.566 --> 27:47.466
to make a purchase
at Cafe Julius in midtown.

27:47.501 --> 27:49.168
Finding the real
Michael Boudreau

27:49.202 --> 27:51.557
might give us
just the break we need.

27:54.607 --> 27:56.808
Castle: Kind of a role reversal,
isn't it?

27:59.546 --> 28:02.381
- Not sure what you mean.
- Oh, sure you do.

28:02.416 --> 28:04.883
Wasn't so long ago
you were in here visiting me.

28:04.918 --> 28:06.852
You got me confused
for Tyson again.

28:06.886 --> 28:08.654
You were dressed
in a police uniform,

28:08.688 --> 28:10.156
and I was in there
where you are now.

28:10.190 --> 28:13.425
People think
it's killing that I like,

28:13.459 --> 28:15.379
but murder's just an act.

28:15.739 --> 28:19.565
It's all about the anticipation,

28:19.599 --> 28:21.567
the planning,

28:21.601 --> 28:24.139
being inside your life,

28:24.571 --> 28:27.775
knowing that I'm gonna take it
all away from you.

28:28.271 --> 28:30.008
That's what I like.

28:32.390 --> 28:34.779
What a feeling
that must've been...

28:34.813 --> 28:38.683
that kind of power over someone.

28:40.819 --> 28:42.454
How does it feel now, Jerry?

28:42.488 --> 28:44.889
Look, I get it...
you think I'm Jerry Tyson,

28:44.923 --> 28:47.024
and I guess I brought that
on myself.

28:47.059 --> 28:50.394
But you [Claps] are jaw jacking
with the wrong guy, okay?

28:50.428 --> 28:51.896
I'm Mike Boudreau.

28:51.930 --> 28:54.264
Why the blondes?

28:54.299 --> 28:55.600
Amy Barrett, Susan Watts.

28:55.634 --> 28:57.635
I-I like blondes,
but like I said,

28:57.669 --> 28:59.904
I don't... I don't know
who this Susan Watts is.

28:59.938 --> 29:01.771
See, I'm betting the reason

29:01.806 --> 29:04.374
goes back to what I said
at the motel.

29:04.409 --> 29:06.993
You really don't know me at all,
do you?

29:07.737 --> 29:09.946
You were raised
by a single mother.

29:09.981 --> 29:11.748
She was blond.

29:11.782 --> 29:14.036
She was beautiful, but...

29:14.056 --> 29:15.952
She never wanted you.

29:16.580 --> 29:19.397
You go into foster care,
the bad kind.

29:20.340 --> 29:21.925
You have so much hate.

29:22.189 --> 29:25.161
So much hate towards your mother
for abandoning you

29:25.195 --> 29:27.631
that you kill these women
to get back at her.

29:28.164 --> 29:30.233
Was I right?

29:30.844 --> 29:33.202
Is this all about mommy?

29:36.431 --> 29:38.491
It I about your mother.

29:40.944 --> 29:42.958
This is all about your mother.

29:44.948 --> 29:46.982
Sorry, Ryan,
I got caught in traffic.

29:47.017 --> 29:49.452
Boudreau is probably
long gone by now.

29:49.486 --> 29:50.853
Ryan: Not necessarily.

29:50.887 --> 29:53.288
He ordered a Cobb salad
at Cafe Julius.

29:53.322 --> 29:54.823
So he may be in there eating.

29:54.858 --> 29:57.542
Okay. I'll check.
I'll call you back.

30:00.030 --> 30:01.864
Wait, Amy Barrett!

30:01.898 --> 30:03.298
Wait... wait,
I need to talk to you.

30:03.332 --> 30:04.466
Who are you?

30:04.500 --> 30:05.801
I'm Detective Beckett.

30:05.835 --> 30:07.302
- Leave me alone.
- No! Wait.

30:07.336 --> 30:08.870
We've been looking for you.

30:08.904 --> 30:11.005
Yeah. Mike's lawyer told me
you'd show up.

30:11.040 --> 30:12.607
He said not to talk to you.

30:12.642 --> 30:14.342
Did you just use
his credit card?

30:14.377 --> 30:15.544
Mike gave me permission.

30:15.578 --> 30:18.180
The man that you know as Michael
Boudreau is Jerry Tyson.

30:18.214 --> 30:20.048
He is a serial killer,

30:20.082 --> 30:21.849
and you will be his next victim.

30:21.884 --> 30:23.051
Back off.

30:23.085 --> 30:24.618
That's my card, Amy! Call me!

30:24.653 --> 30:26.688
Stay the hell away!

30:26.722 --> 30:27.889
[Cellphone rings]

30:27.923 --> 30:28.956
- Hey.
- Castle: I got it.

30:28.991 --> 30:31.292
I know how we can nail Tyson.
The key is his mother.

30:31.326 --> 30:32.160
What about his mom?

30:32.194 --> 30:33.695
Tyson's birth certificate
is missing.

30:33.729 --> 30:35.063
No surprise there.

30:35.097 --> 30:36.530
But his mother signed the papers

30:36.565 --> 30:38.232
when she dumped him
into foster care.

30:38.266 --> 30:40.801
We compare her DNA to his,
we can prove he's Jerry Tyson.

30:40.835 --> 30:41.935
And she's still alive?

30:41.969 --> 30:44.685
And living in white plains.
Her name is Gretchen Cutler.

30:47.440 --> 30:48.709
Gretchen Cutler?

30:48.743 --> 30:50.043
Who wants to know?

30:50.078 --> 30:52.879
Detective Beckett, NYPD.
This is Mr. Castle.

30:52.914 --> 30:55.635
We need to ask you a few
questions about your son.

30:55.821 --> 30:57.250
I don't have a son.

30:57.284 --> 30:59.052
We're talking about Jerry Tyson.

30:59.087 --> 31:01.254
I know who you're talking about.

31:01.288 --> 31:03.556
He hasn't lived here
since he was 9.

31:03.591 --> 31:05.425
When he was put
into foster care.

31:05.459 --> 31:06.929
I was a good mother.

31:06.949 --> 31:09.362
Nothing I ever did could've
made him what he was.

31:09.396 --> 31:11.664
The stuff they said
was not true.

31:11.699 --> 31:13.032
Actually, we believe

31:13.066 --> 31:16.001
that he was unjustly accused
of several crimes.

31:16.036 --> 31:19.051
Yeah, and we are just looking
to clear his name.

31:20.181 --> 31:22.508
It's a little late for that now.

31:22.543 --> 31:23.710
It might help you rest easy

31:23.744 --> 31:26.504
knowing that some of what was
said about Jerry is untrue.

31:26.524 --> 31:29.416
All we would need
is a sample of your DNA.

31:29.689 --> 31:31.250
That won't do you no good.

31:31.284 --> 31:33.433
Jerry wasn't my blood.

31:33.453 --> 31:35.902
You're listed as his mother.
Not by choice.

31:35.922 --> 31:39.925
He was Jeff's kid.
He was a boyfriend at the time.

31:39.960 --> 31:42.027
Jeff took off
and he never came back,

31:42.062 --> 31:42.962
so what was I gonna do?

31:42.996 --> 31:46.064
I tried to make this
a happy home for Jerry.

31:46.098 --> 31:48.099
I looked after him
as long as I could,

31:48.134 --> 31:51.035
but [Sighs] he was a hellion.

31:51.070 --> 31:52.571
He was born that way.

31:52.605 --> 31:55.741
Nothing I ever did could've
made him what he was.

31:56.613 --> 31:58.143
Well, do you know
where Jeff is now

31:58.177 --> 32:00.379
or Jerry's biological mother?

32:00.413 --> 32:02.147
Oh, dead, both of them.

32:02.181 --> 32:03.714
Do you still have
any of his things,

32:03.749 --> 32:05.483
like a toothbrush or hairbrush?

32:05.517 --> 32:07.952
Nothing like that.
Jerry came by years ago,

32:07.987 --> 32:10.822
and he made me hand over
everything that was ever his.

32:10.856 --> 32:12.924
And you didn't keep
any of his belongings?

32:12.958 --> 32:14.675
Nothing at all?

32:17.070 --> 32:19.062
Well, I couldn't let it all go.

32:19.097 --> 32:22.232
I tucked away a few keepsakes.

32:22.267 --> 32:24.435
Mind if I take a look?

32:26.037 --> 32:27.838
His mom sounds like
a real saint.

32:27.872 --> 32:29.006
[Scoffing] Yeah, agreed.

32:29.040 --> 32:31.942
Only people who keep insisting
they're not terrible parents

32:31.976 --> 32:34.111
are terrible parents.

32:36.114 --> 32:38.115
These are all just toys.

32:38.149 --> 32:40.150
Yeah, I don't think we can pull
DNA from any of this.

32:40.185 --> 32:43.024
No, but I mean, these were
Jerry Tyson's toys.

32:43.044 --> 32:44.988
They're just so normal.

32:45.023 --> 32:48.258
What did you expect?
Dead animals, shrunken heads?

32:48.293 --> 32:50.093
No.

32:53.893 --> 32:56.065
Castle.

32:58.235 --> 32:59.425
Baby tooth.

32:59.445 --> 33:00.670
His tooth.

33:00.705 --> 33:01.938
With his DNA.

33:01.972 --> 33:04.024
We got him.

33:04.685 --> 33:07.233
The lab is expediting DNA tests
from the tooth.

33:07.253 --> 33:09.947
They'll call you as soon
as they have prelim results.

33:09.967 --> 33:12.738
Then what are they using
as a comparative sample?

33:12.758 --> 33:15.357
Saliva from a beer that Tyson
was drinking

33:15.377 --> 33:17.275
when we busted him
at the apartment.

33:17.295 --> 33:20.163
Then Tyson has no idea
that we're running his DNA?

33:20.198 --> 33:21.265
Mnh-mnh.

33:21.299 --> 33:22.933
Oh, that's excellent, Kate.

33:22.967 --> 33:24.667
Sir, where are we on the D.A.?

33:24.702 --> 33:26.436
I convinced him
to stall Tyson's lawyer

33:26.470 --> 33:27.437
until the results came in,

33:27.471 --> 33:29.714
and I'll let you know
when I hear something.

33:36.480 --> 33:38.415
Dr. Nieman.

33:38.449 --> 33:40.283
Detective Beckett.

33:40.317 --> 33:42.952
I told you the man in the photo
wasn't Jerry Tyson.

33:42.986 --> 33:44.253
What are you doing here?

33:44.288 --> 33:47.123
- Waiting for Mike Boudreau.
- Interesting.

33:47.157 --> 33:48.690
And what is your relationship
with him?

33:48.725 --> 33:51.360
He's a patient in need
of support.

33:51.395 --> 33:53.262
Wow, you really go
the extra mile.

33:53.297 --> 33:55.131
How soon till Mike is released?

33:55.165 --> 33:57.264
Not as soon as you were hoping.

34:03.020 --> 34:06.189
Tyson's lawyers insisted we move
him from the holding cell.

34:06.209 --> 34:07.923
Kelly Nieman is here.

34:07.943 --> 34:09.637
She's waiting for him
to be released.

34:09.657 --> 34:13.214
I look forward to her
profound disappointment.

34:15.485 --> 34:19.889
You know, I remember back at
the motel when I saw him turn.

34:20.176 --> 34:22.924
When I knew who he was,

34:22.958 --> 34:24.742
and he knew I knew.

34:24.928 --> 34:27.329
It all came to me
a second too late.

34:28.737 --> 34:31.433
I've relived that moment
so many times

34:31.467 --> 34:33.335
knowing that...

34:33.369 --> 34:36.003
my mistake set him free
and cost people lives.

34:36.036 --> 34:38.569
You were almost
one of those people.

34:40.244 --> 34:41.074
And now I have a chance

34:41.109 --> 34:43.174
to help put the genie
back in the bottle,

34:43.194 --> 34:46.781
which is a terrible metaphor
because that guy is no genie.

34:46.815 --> 34:48.815
Who'd want three wishes
from him, right?

34:48.851 --> 34:50.818
[Cellphone rings, beeps]

34:57.192 --> 34:58.292
[Cellphone beeps]

34:58.326 --> 34:59.460
I saw her.

34:59.494 --> 35:01.128

35:01.162 --> 35:02.696
Who? W-who did you see?

35:02.730 --> 35:05.832
The girl that died...
That looked like me.

Susan Watts?

35:08.536 --> 35:09.836
Amy, did you know her?

35:09.871 --> 35:12.005
Do you... do you know anything
about her?

35:12.039 --> 35:14.340
Is that why you arrested Mike?

35:14.375 --> 35:17.110
'Cause you think he could've...

35:17.144 --> 35:19.212
Amy, did he ever say anything
about her?

35:19.246 --> 35:20.780
Did he ever mention her name?

35:20.815 --> 35:22.516
No.

35:22.550 --> 35:24.283
But I saw them together.

35:24.318 --> 35:26.352
- When?
- Three days ago.

35:26.387 --> 35:28.388
Mike was driving the truck.

35:28.422 --> 35:30.223
She was with him.

35:30.257 --> 35:33.479
I thought he was cheating on me,
but now...

35:34.028 --> 35:35.361
I'm afraid.

35:35.396 --> 35:37.696
And you have every reason to be.

35:37.731 --> 35:41.400
But, Amy, I can protect you.
Where are you now?

35:42.489 --> 35:44.369
Corner of 9th ave
and Jane street.

35:44.404 --> 35:46.005
Don't move. I'll be there, okay?

35:46.039 --> 35:47.372
Okay.

35:49.409 --> 35:51.176
- I'll go with you.
- No, Castle.

35:51.210 --> 35:52.678
I don't want to scare her off.

35:52.712 --> 35:54.713
She's the only person
that might be able

35:54.748 --> 35:57.219
to connect Susan Watts' murder
to Tyson.

Pacing's not gonna make
the results come any quicker.

36:22.641 --> 36:25.843
I've been reading how DNA
results degrade over time.

36:25.878 --> 36:28.112
What if they can't pull any
from that tooth?

36:28.146 --> 36:29.881
They can pull DNA
from a caveman tooth.

36:29.915 --> 36:31.348
It's not gonna be a problem.

36:31.383 --> 36:32.583
Still...

might like some company.

Probably just paperwork.

Ah.

37:17.128 --> 37:18.161
[Sighs]

37:18.195 --> 37:20.062
You ever go out to White Plains?

37:20.097 --> 37:22.564
Can't say that I do.

37:22.599 --> 37:26.268
I was, um, I was just out there.

37:26.302 --> 37:28.470
I saw your childhood home.

37:30.723 --> 37:32.608
I met Gretchen Cutler.

37:34.607 --> 37:36.512
I'm not familiar with that name.

37:36.546 --> 37:38.293
You know what she said?

37:39.162 --> 37:41.983
She said nothing she ever did

37:42.018 --> 37:45.220
could've turned you
into what you are.

37:47.457 --> 37:48.990
Is that true?

37:50.166 --> 37:52.445
'Cause I get the feeling
it isn't.

37:52.465 --> 37:55.664
I get the feeling
she's the first person

37:55.698 --> 37:57.699
you ever wanted to kill.

37:57.733 --> 38:00.669
But... that would be...

38:00.703 --> 38:02.704
too obvious.

38:02.738 --> 38:06.675
Better to hunt blond women

38:06.709 --> 38:09.777
who look like Gretchen once did.

38:09.811 --> 38:15.183
See, that way, she'd have to see
their faces on the news

38:15.217 --> 38:20.555
and know that you're out there
killing them because of her.

38:21.152 --> 38:25.526
Now you've taken it to the next
level, though, haven't you?

38:25.561 --> 38:29.730
I, uh... came across this photo
of Gretchen Cutler

38:29.764 --> 38:32.499
when she was young.

38:38.636 --> 38:40.825
Thanks to Kelly Nieman.

compliant victims.

38:50.685 --> 38:52.151
How many were there?

38:52.186 --> 38:54.654
Not just 2.

38:54.689 --> 38:57.338
5? 10?

38:58.951 --> 39:00.359
20?

39:01.296 --> 39:06.165
After all, you don't have to
hunt them anymore.

39:06.200 --> 39:09.555
You raised them...

39:10.437 --> 39:12.471
like livestock.

39:16.976 --> 39:19.029
It's you.

39:21.895 --> 39:23.595
Yes, it is.

39:29.899 --> 39:34.860
If by "you,"
you mean Mike Boudreau.

Yes, ma'am.

40:33.375 --> 40:34.542
How is it possible?

wasn't a match.

40:36.671 --> 40:39.255
It's him. We know it's him.

40:42.893 --> 40:44.127
Ed Turner.

40:44.466 --> 40:45.528
What about him?

40:45.562 --> 40:48.275
The guy who supposedly found
Susan Watts' body.

40:48.817 --> 40:50.099
"Ed Turner."

40:50.134 --> 40:53.247
That name...
it's an anagram for "returned."

40:53.267 --> 40:55.438
Maybe that's a coincidence.

40:55.472 --> 40:58.541
No, it's not. There's no
coincidence with Tyson.

40:58.575 --> 41:00.209
He's always one step ahead.

41:00.243 --> 41:02.018
He wanted to be here.
So did she.
