we can't operate.</i>

03:36.746 --> 03:38.813

<i>McCLAREN: I breached that
trust, and a life was lost.</i>

04:00.536 --> 04:04.705
<i>PARSONS: Oh, fuck.</i>

04:04.707 --> 04:07.675
<i>McCLAREN: Every life
lost is a tragedy.</i>

04:07.677 --> 04:11.345
<i>But an innocent life lost as</i>

04:11.347 --> 04:15.016
<i>collateral damage for corporate

<i>heinous, and... (applause)</i>

04:18.120 --> 04:21.656
<i>Please, please,
uh, hear me out.</i>

04:21.658 --> 04:25.092
<i>I didn't know Naomi Walling.</i>

04:25.094 --> 04:27.328
<i>I never even met her.</i>

04:27.330 --> 04:33.901
<i>She contacted my organization

04:33.903 --> 04:35.136
<i>I don't know how her personal</i>

04:35.138 --> 04:38.606
<i>correspondence made its
way into the leak.</i>

04:38.608 --> 04:44.945
<i>But the fact that it became
public was an error.</i>

04:44.947 --> 04:48.616
<i>And the responsibility rests
squarely on my shoulders.</i>

04:48.618 --> 04:51.352
<i>(crowd murmuring)</i>

04:51.354 --> 04:55.156

admitted he made a mistake.</i>

<i>HERNDON: Well, that's not
enough, you know that.</i>

05:22.852 --> 05:24.518

05:24.520 --> 05:28.923

<i>PARSONS: No.</i>

<i>I don't know what I
would have done.</i>

10:23.786 --> 10:26.487
<i>RACHEL: I have an aunt

10:26.489 --> 10:28.956

all the arrangements.</i>

10:28.958 --> 10:30.591
<i>HEWES: Good.</i>

10:30.593 --> 10:37.531
<i>I've filed a wrongful death suit against
Mr. McClaren and the organization.</i>

10:37.533 --> 10:41.201
<i>I did it immediately, because
I'm afraid McClaren might try</i>

10:41.203 --> 10:43.871
<i>to leave the country, and that
would not be good for us.</i>

10:43.873 --> 10:45.005
<i>RACHEL: Okay.</i>

10:45.007 --> 10:48.475
<i>HEWES: But I have to tell you,
Rachel, right now the case is weak.</i>

10:48.477 --> 10:52.246
<i>RACHEL: Why? McClaren admitted that
he put my mother's stuff on the web.</i>

10:52.248 --> 10:54.615
<i>HEWES: But he said
it was a mistake.</i>

10:54.617 --> 10:58.819
<i>Now, in order to prove
"wrongful death," we have to</i>

10:58.821 --> 11:02.156
<i>show that McClaren had a reason
to go after your mother.</i>

11:02.158 --> 11:03.924
<i>So, the first thing that we're</i>

11:03.926 --> 11:05.459
<i>going to need to do is find out</i>

11:05.461 --> 11:06.527
<i>if your mother had a personal</i>

11:06.529 --> 11:08.896
<i>relationship with Mr. McClaren.</i>

11:08.898 --> 11:10.330
<i>RACHEL: She didn't.</i>

11:10.332 --> 11:13.167
<i>They never even met.</i>

11:17.539 --> 11:19.773
<i>HEWES: How do you know that?</i>

11:19.775 --> 11:24.445
<i>RACHEL: My mother
would've told me.</i>

11:24.447 --> 11:25.446
<i>She's my best friend.</i>

11:25.448 --> 11:29.183
<i>We talk about everything.</i>

11:29.185 --> 11:36.323
<i>I mean, we talked</i>
about everything.

11:36.325 --> 11:40.661
I wish McClaren were
dead, not my mom.

11:40.663 --> 11:43.931
McCLAREN: Patty Hewes convinced the
judge to confiscate my passport.

11:43.933 --> 11:46.400
PARSONS: Yes.

11:46.402 --> 11:48.569
McCLAREN: Then you
failed at the hearing.

11:48.571 --> 11:50.571
PARSONS: I told you not to
speak about Naomi Walling.

11:50.573 --> 11:52.773
You opened your mouth, and
Patty was able to use that

11:52.775 --> 11:55.175
against you in court.

11:57.812 --> 12:03.851
PARSONS: Look...
Let me tell you how Patty Hewes works.

12:03.853 --> 12:07.621
I could go to her tomorrow and
offer a settlement-- even a

12:07.623 --> 12:11.091
good one-- and she
would turn it down.

12:11.093 --> 12:13.560
Your surrender doesn't
interest her at all.

12:13.562 --> 12:17.164
If you fall down, she'll
make sure you get back up.

12:17.166 --> 12:21.702
She wants you on your feet, so she
can keep throwing punches...

12:21.704 --> 12:25.105
over and over and over, until
your reputation is nothing

12:25.107 --> 12:28.175
but an unrecognizable,
bloody pulp.

12:28.177 --> 12:31.645
McCLAREN: The damage that's been done
by this whole Naomi Walling mess...

12:31.647 --> 12:34.314
If people don't trust
me, I've beaten myself.

12:34.316 --> 12:36.683
Regardless of Patty.

12:36.685 --> 12:38.585
I understand the stakes.

12:38.587 --> 12:42.723
PARSONS: Well, then listen to me
next time I give you legal advice.

12:42.725 --> 12:45.225
SIMON: Channing, get
rid of the old one.

12:45.227 --> 12:46.927
Only contact us on this.

12:46.929 --> 12:49.329
These are the only
phones we should use.

12:49.331 --> 12:51.398
We've received more
death threats.

12:51.400 --> 12:52.399
PARSONS: From who?

12:52.401 --> 12:56.236
SIMON: Anonymous. Though I imagine
Wall Street interests are behind them.

12:56.238 --> 12:58.038
I've hired security.

12:58.040 --> 13:00.207
McCLAREN: Is there a
man in your life?

13:00.209 --> 13:02.509
SIMON: - Hey, Channing...
McCLAREN: - She's working for

13:02.511 --> 13:04.678
me-- I feel like I should
know more about her.

13:04.680 --> 13:05.979
PARSONS: No, you shouldn't.

13:05.981 --> 13:08.015
Here's what you should know, the
judge has given Patty a week to

13:08.017 --> 13:08.982
prove that you had intent.

13:08.984 --> 13:10.984
McCLAREN: What intent
could I possibly have?

13:10.986 --> 13:12.986
I've never even met
Naomi Walling.

13:12.988 --> 13:16.757
PARSONS: You've had no
personal contact whatsoever?

13:16.759 --> 13:18.458
McCLAREN: I've answered that.

13:18.460 --> 13:21.995
PARSONS: No, you
stated it, in public.

13:21.997 --> 13:23.497
This is your attorney asking;

13:23.499 --> 13:25.766
now your answer's privileged.

13:25.768 --> 13:29.403
McCLAREN: No, no
contact whatsoever.

13:32.507 --> 13:34.541
PARSONS: Good.

13:36.544 --> 13:38.645
HEWES: Will you head
up something for me?

13:38.647 --> 13:39.646
HERNDON: Anything you need.

13:39.648 --> 13:40.881
I'm just glad to be here.

13:40.883 --> 13:42.015
HEWES: Was that a thank-you?

13:42.017 --> 13:44.685
HERNDON (chuckles): Look, you
know I'm grateful; just don't

13:44.687 --> 13:45.919
make me act like it.

13:45.921 --> 13:47.921
Smiling makes me look stupid.

13:47.923 --> 13:49.323
What is it you need?

13:49.325 --> 13:53.060
HEWES: Well, the first step in
showing intent is to find out

13:53.062 --> 13:56.597
what the relationship between
McClaren and Ms. Walling really was.

13:56.599 --> 13:58.599
HERNDON: He said
he never met her.

13:58.601 --> 14:00.767
HEWES: I don't buy it.

14:00.769 --> 14:03.904
I want you to go through
everything McClaren leaked.

14:03.906 --> 14:07.040
Start with Naomi's private
correspondence, and you might...

14:07.042 --> 14:09.810
HERNDON: Find a personal
connection between them.

14:09.812 --> 14:11.878
I got it.

14:16.884 --> 14:19.853
SIMON: Channing has a brilliant
mind, Ms. Parsons, but

14:19.855 --> 14:23.223
like many a genius, he lacks
certain social skills.

14:23.225 --> 14:25.225
I apologize if his question
was inappropriate.

14:25.227 --> 14:28.228
PARSONS (groans): Oh, don't worry
about me; I can handle myself.

14:28.230 --> 14:31.231
SIMON (sighs): I need to talk to you
about our financial arrangements.

14:31.233 --> 14:32.266
PARSONS: Okay.

14:32.268 --> 14:35.702
SIMON: This scandal has given
many of our donors pause.

14:35.704 --> 14:39.106
We have a cash-flow problem, and
Channing is refusing to divert

14:39.108 --> 14:41.475
contributions for the web
site to his legal defense.

14:41.477 --> 14:45.078
PARSONS: I am already charging
you way less than I should.

14:45.080 --> 14:48.415
Find a way to pay me,
or find another lawyer.

14:48.417 --> 14:50.117
Is there something else?

14:50.119 --> 14:54.221
SIMON: Well, I know you were
Channing's preference...

14:54.223 --> 14:56.623
but your experience
is rather limited.

14:56.625 --> 14:58.292
You have no staff, no support.

14:58.294 --> 15:00.594
Am I meant to believe that you
could handle this case alone?

15:00.596 --> 15:04.398
PARSONS: I'm in the process of
hiring staff and a new associate.

15:04.400 --> 15:05.399
(door creaks open)

15:05.401 --> 15:09.569
Well, you understand my apprehension--
we can't afford any missteps.

15:09.571 --> 15:12.039
The future of this
organization is on the line.

15:12.041 --> 15:14.641
PARSONS: Right now it's not
my staff that's worrying me.

15:14.643 --> 15:15.942
SIMON: So what, then?

15:15.944 --> 15:16.943
PARSONS: It's our judge.

15:16.945 --> 15:20.681
I'm concerned he's cozy with Patty
Hewes, that he'll favor her.

15:20.683 --> 15:22.683
SIMON: Can you have him removed?

15:22.685 --> 15:24.151
PARSONS: It's not that easy.

15:24.153 --> 15:28.522
Just... make sure Channing keeps his mouth
shut and stays out of the public eye.

15:28.524 --> 15:30.557
I'll be in touch.

15:57.352 --> 16:00.721
McCLAREN: You're my gatekeepers.

16:00.723 --> 16:05.225
Responsible for everything
that gets released.

16:05.227 --> 16:10.664
So how is it possible...
that none of you saw Naomi

16:10.666 --> 16:12.466
Walling's personal e-mails?

16:12.468 --> 16:15.702
MAN: Channing, you wanted
the leaks posted quickly.

16:15.704 --> 16:18.972
McCLAREN: Because Princefield
was about to make billions.

16:18.974 --> 16:24.845
MAN: Well, when you move too fast,
without enough manpower, shit happens.

16:24.847 --> 16:26.446
(McClaren chuckles softly)

16:26.448 --> 16:28.882
McCLAREN: "Shit happens."

16:28.884 --> 16:31.885
Is that your answer?

16:31.887 --> 16:34.321
MAN: We were focusing on
the financial documents.

16:34.323 --> 16:37.591
How could we know the woman
would leak her own sex life?

16:37.593 --> 16:40.260
McCLAREN: Do you not understand?

16:40.262 --> 16:45.465
If I don't protect my sources,
they won't share information.

16:45.467 --> 16:47.934
MAN: I'll get to
the bottom of it.

16:47.936 --> 16:49.069
McCLAREN: This is the bottom!

16:49.071 --> 16:51.738
(loud crash)

16:51.740 --> 16:54.808
All of you get the fuck out!

17:06.154 --> 17:09.321
(low, indistinct talking)

17:15.563 --> 17:20.133
NOVAK: Channing...
weren't you the last one to see

17:20.135 --> 17:22.803
the data before it was posted?

17:22.805 --> 17:24.137
McCLAREN: What are you saying?

17:24.138 --> 17:25.372
NOVAK: I'm asking.

17:25.374 --> 17:29.042
Did you let the information
through for some reason?

17:29.044 --> 17:30.777
McCLAREN: Don't be absurd.

17:30.779 --> 17:36.483
NOVAK: I want to protect you--
I just need to know the truth.

17:36.485 --> 17:39.553
Did you know Naomi Walling?

17:43.925 --> 17:47.127
McCLAREN: Leave.

17:47.129 --> 17:49.663
SIMON: Channing...
McCLAREN: She's done.

17:49.665 --> 17:55.101
Go upstairs, pack your
shit and get out.

17:57.605 --> 17:59.639
Now!

18:08.716 --> 18:10.217
SIMON: Come on, you need her.

18:10.219 --> 18:11.451
McCLAREN: Do I?

18:11.453 --> 18:15.722
Seems to me you're all
pretty fucking useless.

18:15.724 --> 18:18.258
SIMON: Where are you going?

18:23.364 --> 18:26.900
PARSONS: You'd think
it'd look better up top.

18:26.902 --> 18:28.134
WORKMAN: No doubt.

18:28.136 --> 18:29.603
It's a new business.

18:29.605 --> 18:31.505
First impressions.

18:31.507 --> 18:33.240
Got to make a splash.

18:33.242 --> 18:34.307
PARSONS: Perfect.

18:34.309 --> 18:35.308
Thanks, Sam.

18:35.310 --> 18:37.544
SAM: I'll get my tools.

18:40.314 --> 18:42.782
WOMAN: Ms. Parsons?

18:42.784 --> 18:46.052
I apologize for the ambush, Ms. Parsons.
Kate Franklin.

18:46.054 --> 18:48.488
PARSONS: I'm sorry, have we met?

18:48.490 --> 18:51.892
FRANKLIN: No, never.

18:51.894 --> 18:53.793
It's... all in here.

18:53.795 --> 18:55.295
PARSONS: What is?

18:55.297 --> 18:59.466
FRANKLIN: My resumé, some history,
various, um, well, anecdotes.

18:59.468 --> 19:00.467
PARSONS: Anecdotes?

19:00.469 --> 19:03.003
FRANKLIN: I heard you're
looking to hire an attorney.

19:03.005 --> 19:05.005
PARSONS: I-I'm not taking
unsolicited applications.

19:05.007 --> 19:07.007
FRANKLIN: Well, of course
you're not; why would you be?

19:07.009 --> 19:08.108
Plus, you've never heard of me;

19:08.110 --> 19:10.577
I have been out of the
game for a while.

19:10.579 --> 19:15.382
But, well, I'm cheap and I'm a quick
study, so please take a look?

19:15.384 --> 19:16.683
PARSONS: Okay.

19:16.685 --> 19:18.952
I'll take a look, but I
can't promise anything.

19:18.954 --> 19:21.288
FRANKLIN: I wouldn't
believe you if you did.

19:21.290 --> 19:24.057
But I <i>can</i> be an
asset to you, Ms. Parsons.

19:24.059 --> 19:26.126
Thank you.

19:29.730 --> 19:31.965
(clattering)

19:34.268 --> 19:35.936
MAN: Oh, sorry, sir.

19:35.938 --> 19:38.939
Anything from dry cleaning?

19:38.941 --> 19:42.609
HERNDON: This is the
only jacket I own.

19:42.611 --> 19:44.678
MAN: Yes, sir.

19:52.253 --> 19:54.287
(groans)

19:56.490 --> 19:58.525
(sighs)

20:06.367 --> 20:08.001
(clears throat)

20:08.003 --> 20:09.269
It's a nice space.

20:09.271 --> 20:12.572
PARSONS: Don't worry, walls
and furniture are coming.

20:12.574 --> 20:14.574
MAN: I can work without walls.

20:14.576 --> 20:16.743
I just spent four years
redlining documents in a

20:16.745 --> 20:19.546
cubicle, surrounded by two
dozen other cubicles.

20:19.548 --> 20:22.248
No walls would be a
nice change of pace.

20:22.250 --> 20:23.483
(Parsons laughs)

20:23.485 --> 20:26.386
PARSONS: Well, it's clear
you've had a fantastic

20:26.388 --> 20:30.357
education, and, um, I really like the
look of the rest of your resume.

20:30.359 --> 20:32.459
MAN: Thanks.

20:32.461 --> 20:38.365
Look... I'm gonna lay it all out there,
Ms. Parsons-- this is my dream job.

20:38.367 --> 20:41.468
A small start-up firm is
exactly what I'm looking for.

20:41.470 --> 20:43.770
PARSONS: Well, I'm
glad to hear it.

20:43.772 --> 20:47.140
MAN: And working on the
McClaren suit would be the

20:47.142 --> 20:49.075
opportunity of a lifetime.

20:49.077 --> 20:51.678
Have you met The
Eel, by the way?

20:51.680 --> 20:54.914
My old firm just tried a
case in front of him.

20:54.916 --> 20:56.449
PARSONS: The Eel?

20:56.451 --> 20:59.552
MAN: That's what the
partners call Judge Haring.

20:59.554 --> 21:03.423
I read he's hearing the
suit against McClaren.

21:03.425 --> 21:04.591
PARSONS: Yes, he is.

21:04.593 --> 21:07.060
MAN: Guess the guy's
pretty slippery.

21:07.062 --> 21:08.294
He plays favorites.

21:08.296 --> 21:13.233
Likes to act impartial, but he
always ends up choosing a side.

21:13.235 --> 21:15.101
PARSONS (quietly): Oh.

21:15.103 --> 21:18.772
Well, Paul, my main objective
here is to create a very open

21:18.774 --> 21:21.975
and inclusive work environment.

21:21.977 --> 21:26.379
PAUL: Uh... in other words,
the opposite of Patty Hewes.

21:26.381 --> 21:28.715
Can't imagine what that
must have been like.

21:28.717 --> 21:30.717
PARSONS: It was an
amazing experience.

21:30.719 --> 21:32.819
But I prefer to look forward.

21:32.821 --> 21:35.855
PAUL: I heard she would throw
shoes at paralegals' heads.

21:35.857 --> 21:38.124
PARSONS: I don't know
anything about that.

21:38.126 --> 21:40.927
PAUL: What about the time she had her P.I.
dangle a witness

21:40.929 --> 21:43.863
out a 20-story window to
get him to tell the truth?

21:43.865 --> 21:45.231
PARSONS: That never happened.

21:45.233 --> 21:48.802
PAUL: Oh, come on, you
must have some dirt.

21:48.804 --> 21:53.673
I won't tell.

21:53.675 --> 21:55.875
PARSONS: Thank you
for coming by.

21:55.877 --> 21:58.578
If I need to, I will call
some of your references.

21:58.580 --> 22:03.383
PAUL (chuckles): Oh, uh... Okay.

22:04.518 --> 22:06.019
PARSONS: Nice to meet you.

22:17.865 --> 22:20.333
HERNDON: Oh, listen, I've
put together a team.

22:20.335 --> 22:22.469
We've been reading
through the whole leak.

22:22.471 --> 22:23.470
HEWES: Find anything?

22:23.472 --> 22:25.739
HERNDON: Well, there's
nothing in Naomi Walling's

22:25.741 --> 22:28.608
e-mails that indicate a personal
connection to McClaren.

22:28.610 --> 22:32.445
But there may be something
of interest, though.

22:32.447 --> 22:35.014
Uh, Jason, can I
have that file?

22:35.016 --> 22:37.517
MAN: Mr. Herndon, I've been
working with you around the

22:37.519 --> 22:38.885
clock for two straight days.

22:38.887 --> 22:41.121
HERNDON: Yeah, so?

22:41.123 --> 22:43.323
MIKE: My name is Mike.

22:43.325 --> 22:47.494
HERNDON: Naomi was no blushing daisy,
but she was a creature of habit.

22:47.496 --> 22:49.596
She had all her trysts
in the same hotel.

22:49.598 --> 22:53.066
She preferred the, uh...
what hotel was the, uh...?

22:53.068 --> 22:54.067
MIKE: Montclair.

22:54.069 --> 22:55.068
(Herndon clears throat)

22:55.070 --> 22:57.103
HERNDON: According to her
credit card record, she booked

22:57.105 --> 22:59.239
the hotel the night that
McClaren was in town.

22:59.241 --> 23:01.441
HEWES: All right, check the
Montclair, see if anyone saw

23:01.443 --> 23:03.777
Naomi and McClaren.

23:15.689 --> 23:18.725
♪

23:44.118 --> 23:46.853
(siren wailing in distance)

24:01.468 --> 24:03.503
HERNDON: Mm.

24:24.992 --> 24:26.960
WOMAN: Bill, Patty just got in.

24:26.962 --> 24:28.761
HERNDON: Shit.

24:28.763 --> 24:30.363
(groans): Oy.

24:30.365 --> 24:33.433
(indistinct, lively chatter)

24:49.617 --> 24:50.583
McCLAREN: What do you want?

24:50.585 --> 24:51.584
MAN: You showed up.

24:51.586 --> 24:52.952
Wasn't sure you would.

24:52.954 --> 24:55.221
McCLAREN: Yeah,
asshole, I showed up.

24:55.223 --> 24:57.290
What do you want?

25:00.661 --> 25:03.396
MAN: That woman who
offed herself.

25:03.398 --> 25:04.998
McCLAREN: Naomi. Walling.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.100
MAN: Yeah. Her leak.

25:07.102 --> 25:10.904
You don't know the whole story.

25:10.906 --> 25:13.973
I could get you a lot more.

25:18.078 --> 25:20.613
McCLAREN: Why are we
meeting in person?

25:20.615 --> 25:23.249
If you have information,
you know the protocol.

25:23.251 --> 25:26.786
MAN: Well, sure, I could just <i>give</i> you
what I got, but times are rough, you know?

25:26.788 --> 25:28.187
I've got expenses.

25:28.189 --> 25:29.756
I need to upgrade my system.

25:29.758 --> 25:33.593
I've got my eye on some
new blade servers.

25:33.595 --> 25:38.298
McCLAREN: Have you ever known
me to pay for information?

25:38.300 --> 25:40.900
MAN: Princefield is your baby.

25:40.902 --> 25:45.305
You don't want to be in the dark
when this breaks somewhere else.

25:49.043 --> 25:50.376
Better decide fast.

25:50.378 --> 25:56.783
I ate a bad burrito, and I'm
gonna go drop a bomb in the can.

25:56.785 --> 25:58.985
So what's it gonna be?

25:58.987 --> 26:02.088
Want to do business?

26:02.090 --> 26:03.690
McCLAREN: No, I don't.

26:03.692 --> 26:05.792
Bombs away.

26:05.794 --> 26:07.961
MAN: Suit yourself.

26:07.963 --> 26:11.030
But you'll regret it.

26:20.341 --> 26:22.709
PARSONS (sighs): Would
you like a drink?

26:22.711 --> 26:25.378
I think I have some bourbon
in a box somewhere.

26:25.380 --> 26:26.512
SIMON: No, thank you.

26:26.514 --> 26:29.115
I just wanted an update on the
situation with our judge.

26:29.117 --> 26:32.318
PARSONS: Well, I've
done some research.

26:32.320 --> 26:35.254
There's an interesting pattern
in his decisions involving the

26:35.256 --> 26:38.024
State Energy Association.

26:38.026 --> 26:40.093
SIMON: Interesting enough
to have him removed?

26:40.095 --> 26:42.729
PARSONS: Everything I have
right now is circumstantial.

26:42.731 --> 26:46.165
It's just a hunch, unless
I can verify it somehow.

26:46.167 --> 26:48.735
SIMON (sighs): A hunch?

26:48.737 --> 26:51.637
(smacks lips) I see.

26:51.639 --> 26:54.607
Well, that doesn't
inspire confidence.

26:54.609 --> 26:55.842
PARSONS: I'm working on it.

26:55.844 --> 26:59.045
But if you have a secret formula
to get an unfavorable judge

26:59.047 --> 27:02.081
removed, by all means speak up.

27:05.652 --> 27:07.353
How's Channing holding up?

27:07.355 --> 27:08.588
SIMON: He's fine.

27:08.590 --> 27:10.223
Yeah. Doing well.

27:10.225 --> 27:13.292
Channing thrives on pressure.

27:15.829 --> 27:17.196
McCLAREN: Vodka, neat.

27:17.198 --> 27:19.265
Yeah.

27:22.036 --> 27:26.105
KEVIN: Oh, you can't
smoke in here.

27:26.107 --> 27:28.608
McCLAREN: Is that a joke?

27:28.610 --> 27:32.412
KEVIN: No. It's the law.

27:32.414 --> 27:33.613
McCLAREN: Can't be.

27:33.615 --> 27:35.915
This is New York City.

27:35.917 --> 27:39.018
WOMAN: It's been the law
for the last decade.

27:41.622 --> 27:44.323
McCLAREN: Oh, so dickhead here
was telling me the truth?

27:44.325 --> 27:47.927
KEVIN: I said put
it out, douche bag.

27:51.899 --> 27:54.500
McCLAREN: Sure thing.

27:56.737 --> 27:58.004
How was that, sweetheart?

27:58.006 --> 27:59.005
I put out the fire.

27:59.007 --> 28:01.707
KEVIN: All right, asshole,
get the fuck out of here.

28:01.709 --> 28:02.975
(glass clatters)

28:02.977 --> 28:06.045
Get the fuck out of here!

28:13.620 --> 28:15.154
WOMAN: Hey.

28:15.156 --> 28:17.957
I've seen you
before, haven't I?

28:17.959 --> 28:19.325
McCLAREN: I doubt it.

28:19.327 --> 28:21.594
WOMAN: You're not that
whistleblower guy?

28:21.596 --> 28:23.696
With the web site?

28:23.698 --> 28:25.198
McCLAREN: Nope. Sorry.

28:25.200 --> 28:26.332
WOMAN: Come on.

28:26.334 --> 28:29.268
You're Channing McMartin.

28:29.270 --> 28:30.403
McCLAREN: McClaren.

28:30.405 --> 28:31.804
Channing McClaren.

28:31.806 --> 28:33.172
WOMAN: McClaren.

28:33.174 --> 28:35.808
Right. Sorry.

28:35.810 --> 28:38.377
McClarenTruth.org.

28:38.379 --> 28:39.679
McCLAREN: There you go.

28:39.681 --> 28:43.483
You got it.

28:43.485 --> 28:45.284
WOMAN: Holy fuck.

28:45.286 --> 28:47.720
It really is you.

28:53.627 --> 28:54.627
FRANKLIN: Hello?

28:54.629 --> 28:56.796
PARSONS: I read your file.

28:56.798 --> 28:58.297
FRANKLIN: That was quick.

28:58.299 --> 29:00.733
PARSONS: Interesting anecdotes.

29:00.735 --> 29:01.734
I'm intrigued.

29:01.736 --> 29:03.736
FRANKLIN: I thought
you might be.

29:03.738 --> 29:06.472
PARSONS: I think we should talk.

29:06.474 --> 29:08.908
FRANKLIN: I'd love to.

29:28.328 --> 29:30.029
WOMAN: You want to come up?

29:30.031 --> 29:31.697
McCLAREN: Are you sure?

29:31.699 --> 29:33.766
WOMAN: I'm sure.

29:55.589 --> 29:57.523
WOMAN (chuckles):
What's that for?

29:57.525 --> 29:59.392
McCLAREN: I'm not
fan of cameras.

29:59.394 --> 30:02.328
WOMAN: Mm, it's kind of hot.

30:02.330 --> 30:04.664
McCLAREN: Let's go.

30:16.143 --> 30:18.644
HERNDON: Yeah, I just got the
rest of the surveillance videos

30:18.646 --> 30:21.380
from Naomi Walling's
hotel of choice.

30:21.382 --> 30:22.715
HEWES: Is McClaren in there?

30:22.717 --> 30:25.284
HERNDON: Well, I don't know
yet-- I'm only halfway through.

30:25.286 --> 30:28.487
So far it's only, you know,
bellhops and scullery maids.

30:28.489 --> 30:29.488
HEWES: Keep looking.

30:29.490 --> 30:33.726
HERNDON: Oh, by the way, who is that,
uh, tall, leggy woman in your office?

30:33.728 --> 30:35.895
HEWES: An old
acquaintance of mine.

30:35.897 --> 30:37.396
Get... back to work.

30:37.398 --> 30:40.866
HERNDON: I'm going,
going, going.

30:43.570 --> 30:45.471
(door opens)

30:45.473 --> 30:46.973
(door closes)

30:46.975 --> 30:50.676
HEWES: Kate.

30:50.678 --> 30:53.179
My goodness, you
haven't aged a day.

30:53.181 --> 30:54.180
FRANKLIN: Oh, bullshit.

30:54.182 --> 30:55.615
I'm barely recognizable.

30:55.617 --> 30:57.116
It's been 25 years.

30:57.118 --> 31:00.086
HEWES: I have to say, it took a
minute when my assistant told

31:00.088 --> 31:02.622
me a Kate <i>Franklin</i> had called.

31:02.624 --> 31:04.757
FRANKLIN: I took my husband's
name; didn't seem quite so

31:04.759 --> 31:05.725
pathetic back then.

31:05.727 --> 31:06.726
(Hewes chuckles)

31:06.728 --> 31:07.893
But I see you kept yours.

31:07.895 --> 31:09.095
Makes sense.

31:09.097 --> 31:12.832
You were established, didn't
want to obscure the brand.

31:12.834 --> 31:13.833
HEWES: Sit.

31:13.835 --> 31:16.135
FRANKLIN: Thank you.

31:20.607 --> 31:24.877
HEWES: So...
why did you want to see me?

31:24.879 --> 31:28.748
FRANKLIN: My husband Ted died
a couple of years ago...

31:28.750 --> 31:32.118
and, uh, well, my youngest is
away at college, so I guess I'm

31:32.120 --> 31:33.519
looking for a second act.

31:33.521 --> 31:37.590
HEWES: When you quit the
law, it seemed definitive.

31:37.592 --> 31:42.161
I remember... some anger.

31:42.163 --> 31:44.263
FRANKLIN: Little bit.

31:44.265 --> 31:46.299
HEWES: So you're
looking for a job?

31:46.301 --> 31:49.302
FRANKLIN: Actually, an old friend of
yours has already offered me one.

31:49.304 --> 31:50.303
HEWES: Oh, really?

31:50.305 --> 31:51.370
Who's that?

31:51.372 --> 31:54.106
FRANKLIN: Ellen Parsons.

31:56.977 --> 32:00.413
HEWES: It isn't often that
I am truly surprised.

32:00.415 --> 32:02.481
Well done.

32:06.053 --> 32:07.086
Tea?

32:07.088 --> 32:08.187
FRANKLIN: I would love some.

32:08.189 --> 32:10.256
HEWES: Good.

32:12.626 --> 32:17.730
Maggie, could you
please get us some tea?

32:17.732 --> 32:25.638
So, if Ms. Parsons is making you an offer,
I suspect you're here to negotiate.

32:29.910 --> 32:32.611
That doesn't seem like you.

32:32.613 --> 32:35.915
You were never
much of a schemer.

32:35.917 --> 32:38.451
FRANKLIN: I guess I finally
understand the pleasure of a

32:38.453 --> 32:40.953
little bit of leverage.

32:40.955 --> 32:42.788
HEWES: Good for you.

32:42.790 --> 32:45.324
FRANKLIN: So how about you
double the girl's offer?

32:45.326 --> 32:47.626
HEWES (chuckles): Double?

32:47.628 --> 32:50.196
FRANKLIN: I figure that's a fair
price to keep someone from

32:50.198 --> 32:54.233
your past from working
for the other side.

32:54.235 --> 32:56.202
MAGGIE: Ms. Hewes?

32:56.204 --> 32:57.937
Judge Haring's on the line.

32:57.939 --> 32:59.939
HEWES: Oh.
Is it about scheduling?

32:59.941 --> 33:01.607
MAGGIE: No, he said
it's personal.

33:01.609 --> 33:05.745
HEWES: Well, tell him I'll have
to call him back this evening.

33:10.250 --> 33:14.620
FRANKLIN: So...
what am I worth to you?

33:18.325 --> 33:18.891
SIMON: Okay, Channing.

33:18.893 --> 33:19.892
Come on, man.

33:19.894 --> 33:21.293
This can't carry on.

33:21.295 --> 33:23.496
I've left you,
like, 20 messages.

33:23.498 --> 33:25.765
We're in the middle
of a lawsuit here.

33:25.767 --> 33:28.901
Now is not the time to be
out there dicking around.

33:28.903 --> 33:32.505
- Just give me a call as soon as you get...
McCLAREN: - We need to talk.

33:32.507 --> 33:33.272
Get Gitta down here.

33:33.274 --> 33:34.874
SIMON: Well, Gitta's
at the airport.

33:34.876 --> 33:35.441
McCLAREN: Why?

33:35.443 --> 33:36.842
SIMON: 'Cause you fired her.

33:36.844 --> 33:37.676
McCLAREN: Well, get her back.

33:37.678 --> 33:38.944
We have work to do.

33:38.946 --> 33:40.146
SIMON: Why? What's going on?

33:40.148 --> 33:41.847
McCLAREN: There's more
information out there.

33:41.849 --> 33:42.815
SIMON: About what?

33:42.817 --> 33:45.050
McCLAREN: Princefield, Naomi
Walling, I'm not sure.

33:45.052 --> 33:48.754
But we need to find it.

33:48.756 --> 33:53.726
FRANKLIN: So, I went
to see Patty Hewes.

33:53.728 --> 33:55.194
She offered me a job.

33:55.196 --> 33:55.995
You were right.

33:55.997 --> 33:58.030
She does not want
me to work for you.

33:58.032 --> 34:02.201
She said that whatever you were
willing to pay me, she'd double it.

34:02.203 --> 34:03.903
PARSONS: Did she
put it in writing?

34:03.905 --> 34:06.672
FRANKLIN: Mm-hmm.

34:06.674 --> 34:11.010
Less than a hour later,
contract was delivered to me.

34:21.254 --> 34:23.289
Did I pass the test?

34:25.759 --> 34:27.626
PARSONS: You said you wanted
to get back into the game.

34:27.628 --> 34:29.462
Why didn't you take
Patty's offer?

34:29.464 --> 34:33.966
FRANKLIN: I told you,
I don't like her.

34:33.967 --> 34:38.337
Something else happened while I was there
that I think you might be interested in.

34:38.339 --> 34:40.339
PARSONS: What was that?

34:40.341 --> 34:41.940
FRANKLIN: Judge Haring called.

34:41.943 --> 34:45.878
Sounds like they're having an
extracurricular communication.

35:11.037 --> 35:13.806
WOMAN: Anything?

35:13.808 --> 35:16.242
MAN: She wants to make a call.

35:16.244 --> 35:17.376
WOMAN: To her attorney?

35:17.378 --> 35:19.745
MAN: Didn't say.

35:19.747 --> 35:22.081
Anything on Ellen Parsons?

35:22.083 --> 35:24.316
WOMAN: No.

35:24.318 --> 35:26.552
Still can't find her.

35:56.550 --> 35:58.584
♪

36:28.515 --> 36:30.549
♪

36:44.698 --> 36:45.931
(gasps)

36:45.933 --> 36:46.899
PARSONS: Jesus!

36:46.901 --> 36:47.866
COOPER: What's wrong?

36:47.868 --> 36:49.301
You gave me the code.

36:49.303 --> 36:53.005
I thought I had the
run of the place.

36:53.007 --> 36:54.873
I've been tracking
McClaren for you.

36:54.875 --> 36:57.242
PARSONS: So what'd you find out?

36:57.244 --> 36:59.812
COOPER: I checked out that hotel
you flagged from the leak.

36:59.814 --> 37:00.913
PARSONS: The Montclair?

37:00.915 --> 37:02.681
COOPER: Yep.

37:02.683 --> 37:06.485
Got some surveillance video.

37:06.487 --> 37:07.753
Couple interesting cameos.

37:07.755 --> 37:15.361
Well, one interesting cameo, and one
cameo that is totally off the hook.

37:17.731 --> 37:19.131
PARSONS: Naomi Walling.

37:19.133 --> 37:24.336
COOPER: She rented a room the night
before the leak went public.

37:24.338 --> 37:26.572
And... that's him.

37:26.574 --> 37:27.473
PARSONS: Who?

37:27.475 --> 37:29.908
COOPER: McClaren.

37:32.612 --> 37:34.847
PARSONS: That's McClaren?

37:34.849 --> 37:36.949
COOPER: Check this out.

37:46.626 --> 37:49.695
Told you he was interesting.

37:49.697 --> 37:51.764
PARSONS: He's also a liar.

37:51.766 --> 37:52.665
COOPER: Sure is.

37:52.667 --> 37:56.402
'Cause he definitely met with
Walling before she died.

37:56.404 --> 37:57.369
PARSONS: Shit.

37:57.371 --> 37:59.738
COOPER: I know he's your
client, but be careful.

37:59.740 --> 38:03.075
I've seen guys like
McClaren before.

38:03.077 --> 38:05.377
Got some kind of worm in 'em.

38:05.379 --> 38:09.581
Start twisting and
the freak comes out.

38:09.583 --> 38:11.650
Watch your back.

38:14.988 --> 38:17.790
Give Chris a shout for me.

38:17.792 --> 38:20.159
I'm glad he hooked us up.

38:20.161 --> 38:22.594
I like this line of work.

38:28.735 --> 38:31.837
HERNDON: 7:32 p.m., Naomi
Walling heads to her room.

38:31.839 --> 38:34.707
10:10 p.m., she leaves.

38:34.709 --> 38:36.942
In that time, no
sign of McClaren.

38:36.944 --> 38:39.278
HEWES: Could a meeting have
occurred at some other time?

38:39.280 --> 38:41.613
HERNDON: We monitored the room
from check-in to check-out.

38:41.615 --> 38:43.682
Even half a dozen hours
before and after.

38:43.684 --> 38:45.384
HEWES: So who did
she meet there?

38:45.386 --> 38:47.653
HERNDON: I don't know.

38:51.024 --> 38:52.624
SIMON: Thanks for coming.

38:52.626 --> 38:53.992
PARSONS: Why am I here?

38:53.994 --> 38:56.862
You were very secretive
on the phone.

38:56.864 --> 39:01.333
SIMON: I made inroads into Judge Haring
and the State Energy Association.

39:01.335 --> 39:02.334
PARSONS: Inroads?

39:02.336 --> 39:04.636
I didn't ask you to
make any inroads.

39:04.638 --> 39:10.375
SIMON: Well, nevertheless, I was able
to verify a certain quid pro quo.

39:10.377 --> 39:13.312
PARSONS: And how were
you able to do this?

39:13.314 --> 39:14.947
SIMON: Is that important?

39:14.949 --> 39:17.316
PARSONS: It is to me.

39:17.318 --> 39:19.618
SIMON: Ms. Parsons, information
floats around us all

39:19.620 --> 39:23.122
the time, out there in the
ether, invisible to most.

39:23.124 --> 39:26.792
We happen to be very
skilled at spotting it.

39:26.794 --> 39:27.693
PARSONS: "We"?

39:27.695 --> 39:29.161
Does Channing know about this?

39:29.163 --> 39:31.930
SIMON: No, of course not.

39:31.932 --> 39:34.199
If you and I are going to be
working together, there's

39:34.201 --> 39:39.438
certain things that we
need to keep from him.

39:39.440 --> 39:40.739
Use it or don't.

39:40.741 --> 39:42.808
It's up to you.

39:49.182 --> 39:51.917
PARSONS: Good afternoon,
Your Honor.

39:51.919 --> 39:52.885
HARING: Ms. Parsons.

39:52.887 --> 39:54.586
What you are doing here?

39:54.588 --> 39:57.990
PARSONS: I wanted to talk to
you about the McClaren case.

39:57.992 --> 40:02.995
HARING: Any conversation we
have is going to be on record.

40:02.997 --> 40:05.297
PARSONS: Do you really want
to go on the record to talk

40:05.299 --> 40:08.300
about the State
Energy Association?

40:08.302 --> 40:11.170
Every case you've heard against
them, you've decided in their

40:11.172 --> 40:14.239
favor or tossed out of court.

40:14.241 --> 40:19.111
Which struck me as odd, until I found
out they helped you get elected.

40:19.113 --> 40:25.217
HARING: I'll chalk these accusations
up to youth or desperation.

40:25.219 --> 40:28.086
Either way, you don't
want to pursue them.

40:28.088 --> 40:30.422
PARSONS: What I don't want is
to try a case in front of a

40:30.424 --> 40:32.491
judge who plays favorites.

40:32.493 --> 40:36.395
HARING: If you think I'm going
to recuse myself based on

40:36.397 --> 40:42.234
speculation and idle threats,
you're sadly mistaken.

40:42.236 --> 40:47.272
PARSONS: Sir, these
threats aren't idle.

40:47.274 --> 40:50.075
Take a look at this.

40:54.347 --> 40:56.915
Have a great day.

41:02.889 --> 41:04.923
HARING: This will be quick.

41:10.430 --> 41:16.468
Due to unforeseen personal
circumstances, I'm afraid I need

41:16.470 --> 41:19.171
to remove myself from this case.

41:21.174 --> 41:24.610
My wife has fallen ill.

41:24.612 --> 41:27.479
PARSONS: Very sorry to
hear that, Your Honor.

41:27.481 --> 41:30.382
HARING: The Honorable Judge
Richard Gearhart will be

41:30.384 --> 41:32.918
replacing me on the bench.

41:32.920 --> 41:36.188
Thank you for your
understanding.

41:51.871 --> 41:53.906
(phone ringing)

42:02.015 --> 42:04.483
PARSONS: Ellen Parsons.

42:04.485 --> 42:08.954
HEWES: I'm proud of you, Ellen.

42:08.956 --> 42:10.622
PARSONS: Why's that?

42:10.624 --> 42:15.494
HEWES: You took the initiative,
played outside the rules.

42:15.496 --> 42:16.929
PARSONS: Did I?

42:16.931 --> 42:19.631
HEWES: You thought I had an
inappropriate relationship with

42:19.633 --> 42:25.203
the judge, so you found
leverage and forced him out.

42:25.205 --> 42:27.973
PARSONS: That's quite
an accusation, Patty.

42:27.975 --> 42:30.309
HEWES: It was a risky move.

42:30.311 --> 42:32.678
But a strong one.

42:32.680 --> 42:35.380
I hope it'll be worth it.

42:35.382 --> 42:37.883
PARSONS: I'm sure it will be.

42:37.885 --> 42:40.752
HEWES: Then perhaps it hasn't
occurred to you that things

42:40.754 --> 42:43.655
aren't always what they seem.

42:43.657 --> 42:47.092
Paranoia does strange
things, Ellen.

42:47.094 --> 42:51.396
It can make people believe
in things that aren't true.

42:51.398 --> 42:52.397
Tea?

42:52.399 --> 42:53.832
FRANKLIN: I would love some.

42:53.834 --> 42:55.867
HEWES: Good.

42:55.869 --> 42:57.869
FRANKLIN: Something else
happened while I was there that

42:57.871 --> 42:59.905
I think you might
be interested in.

42:59.907 --> 43:00.572
PARSONS: What was that?

43:00.574 --> 43:02.174
FRANKLIN: Judge Haring called.

43:02.176 --> 43:05.877
Sounds like they're having an
extracurricular communication.

43:05.879 --> 43:07.879
HEWES: Maggie, could you
please get us some tea?

43:07.881 --> 43:08.880
MAGGIE: Mm-hmm.

43:08.882 --> 43:09.982
HEWES (whispers): Interrupt.

43:09.984 --> 43:10.749
Judge Haring.

43:10.751 --> 43:13.118
Personal call.

43:13.120 --> 43:15.721
MAGGIE: Ms. Hewes, Judge
Haring's on the line.

43:15.723 --> 43:17.356
HEWES: Oh, is it
about scheduling?

43:17.358 --> 43:19.458
MAGGIE: No, he said
it's personal.

43:19.460 --> 43:22.761
HEWES: Tell him I'll have to
call him back this evening.

43:22.763 --> 43:27.032
It can even make you see
things that didn't happen.

43:40.246 --> 43:42.180
(Hewes laughs)

43:42.182 --> 43:45.317
Are you still upset
about that, Tim?

43:45.319 --> 43:47.586
I'm the one who got
you on the board.

43:47.588 --> 43:48.954
HARING: Bullshit.

43:48.956 --> 43:51.289
I earned my way on.

43:51.291 --> 43:55.494
HEWES: Why don't we
put that behind us.

43:57.797 --> 44:01.099
HARING: One hint of your usual
shit and I'll throw you

44:01.101 --> 44:05.137
and your case out on your ass.

44:08.674 --> 44:16.048
HEWES: The truth is, Judge Haring
and I don't like each other.

44:16.050 --> 44:19.017
He wouldn't have been
good for my case.

44:19.019 --> 44:22.954
I'm looking forward to
the new judge, though.

44:22.956 --> 44:26.525
I'm assuming you haven't
done your research on him.

44:32.298 --> 44:35.333
GEARHART: Ms. Hewes, I see
here Judge Haring didn't feel

44:35.335 --> 44:37.869
you had the evidence necessary
to proceed with this case.

44:37.871 --> 44:40.405
HEWES: Yes, Your Honor.

44:40.407 --> 44:43.108
GEARHART: Well, reading
your original complaint, I

44:43.110 --> 44:45.010
respectfully disagree
with Judge Haring.

44:45.012 --> 44:47.913
I see no reason why this
case can't proceed.

44:47.915 --> 44:51.416
PARSONS: But, Your Honor, Ms. Hewes readily
admits she has no compelling evidence.

44:51.418 --> 44:54.086
GEARHART: Well, feel free
to argue that in court.

44:54.088 --> 44:56.154
Motion to dismiss denied.

44:56.156 --> 44:58.423
You may both
commence discovery.

44:58.425 --> 45:00.158
HEWES: Thank you, Your Honor.

45:00.160 --> 45:03.628
GEARHART: Welcome to my
courtroom, Ms. Parsons.

45:03.630 --> 45:08.200
Patty, it's nice
to have you back.

45:08.202 --> 45:11.069
HEWES: It's great to be here.

45:20.279 --> 45:22.180
(line ringing)

45:27.987 --> 45:30.021
(cell phone ringing)
