WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:03.504
ADULT ADAM: Ah,
restaurants of the '80s.

00:03.571 --> 00:06.374
Back then, dining out
with your family was
the highlight of the week.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.342
Unless, of course,
you came from a loud family

00:08.409 --> 00:09.643
with no sense of boundaries.

00:09.710 --> 00:11.812
A family like mine.

00:11.879 --> 00:13.881
I can't believe
you're really here.

00:13.947 --> 00:15.849
So you're not mad
that I surprised you
at college?

00:15.916 --> 00:17.351
I mean, I know you hate
that kind of thing.

00:17.418 --> 00:20.588
Geoff, you being here
is the perfect gift. Really.

00:20.654 --> 00:22.423
But you know
what's an even better gift

00:22.490 --> 00:24.358
than just the two of us
celebrating your birthday?

00:26.060 --> 00:27.795
ALL: Surprise.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.697
Wait, it's your birthday?

00:29.763 --> 00:31.199
You all told me
we were coming here

00:31.265 --> 00:33.000
so I can be scouted
by the Washington Bullets!

00:33.067 --> 00:34.502
Oh, my God!

00:34.568 --> 00:36.837
You invited
my whole family!

00:36.904 --> 00:39.840
To dinner! In public.
Why

00:39.907 --> 00:41.242
We all drove
down together!

00:41.309 --> 00:42.810
Murray made me
pump gas.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.078
And nobody
rides for free.

00:44.145 --> 00:46.814
Do you mind
giving me a sec
with my special guy

00:46.880 --> 00:48.682
so that I can
thank him properly?

00:48.749 --> 00:50.851
Hurry back!
Our table's almost ready.

00:50.918 --> 00:53.053
Hi, can you grab our menus?
We're ready to sit.

00:53.121 --> 00:55.256
I'm sorry,
there's a few parties
ahead of you.

00:55.323 --> 00:57.057
I'm hungry, Bevy.
What's the girl saying?

00:57.125 --> 00:58.759
The girl's saying
there's people ahead of us

00:58.826 --> 01:00.728
but I'm just gonna nudge her
until she gives in.

01:00.794 --> 01:02.363
It'll just be a few
more minutes, ma'am.

01:02.430 --> 01:03.997
What do you mean
a few more minutes?

01:04.064 --> 01:06.634
That table just sat down
and they arrived
five minutes after us.

01:06.700 --> 01:09.137
Ma'am, I understand.
But there was
a two top ready.

01:09.203 --> 01:12.740
So just because I decide to
build a life around my family
I'm suddenly to blame?

01:12.806 --> 01:14.108
I'm starving, Bevy.

01:14.175 --> 01:15.576
Here's the thing.

01:15.643 --> 01:18.679
My husband's
blood sugar is in freefall,
we're on borrowed time.

01:18.746 --> 01:19.747
Bevy, I'm starving!

01:19.813 --> 01:21.048
BEVERLY: Hear that,
he's starving.

01:21.115 --> 01:23.784
How could you?
My family, Geoff?
My family?

01:23.851 --> 01:26.086
Um, yeah? Am I
missing something here?
It's just dinner.

01:26.154 --> 01:29.923
At a restaurant?
It's the worst humiliation
known to man.

01:29.990 --> 01:32.860
Their most terrible qualities
are magnified by a thousand.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.863
You don't even understand
the events that you've
set into motion.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.199
Leave right now
or this relationship is over.

01:38.266 --> 01:40.668
You're gonna break up
with me over a dinner
at Beefsteak Charlie's?

01:40.734 --> 01:42.803
No! You're gonna
break up with me!

01:42.870 --> 01:45.339
You're never gonna want to
stay after the horrors
you see tonight.

01:45.406 --> 01:48.342
Bevy? This isn't good.
I'm getting shaky hungry.

01:48.409 --> 01:50.211
If I don't eat soon,
I'm gonna have to lie down.

01:50.278 --> 01:51.379
I'll get you a roll, Murray.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.347
Ma, Dad's lying
on people again.

01:53.414 --> 01:56.417
All right, either get us
a table or give this man
a hot buttered roll.

01:56.484 --> 01:57.485
No pumpernickel.

01:57.551 --> 01:58.986
He says no pumpernickel!

01:59.052 --> 02:01.222
BEVERLY: For the love of God,
no pumpernickel!

02:01.289 --> 02:03.357
Geoff, look at me.
Whatever happens tonight,

02:03.424 --> 02:05.826
I need you to know
that I love you with
all of my heart.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.795
I'm getting scared, Erica.
What's gonna happen?

02:07.861 --> 02:10.364
I'll tell you
what's gonna happen.

02:10.431 --> 02:12.333
Dinner with the Goldbergs.

02:15.303 --> 02:18.138
ADULT ADAM: Every dinner
at a restaurant begins with
being seated at a table.

02:18.206 --> 02:20.874
But for my picky family,
no table was good enough.

02:20.941 --> 02:22.176
Here we are, folks.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.478
I'm sorry. I... I don't
mean to be a nudge

02:24.545 --> 02:26.380
but this table
is garbage.

02:26.447 --> 02:28.382
I mean, look it's right
next to the kitchen.

02:28.449 --> 02:30.117
No worries.
Right this way.

02:30.184 --> 02:32.920
ADULT ADAM:
And so this embarrassing
display always happened.

02:32.986 --> 02:36.224
This one's right under
the air conditioner.

02:36.290 --> 02:38.091
We want dinner,
not pneumonia.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.127
I... I can't eat here.
There's an echo.

02:40.194 --> 02:41.795
Do you hear it?

02:41.862 --> 02:44.164
We can't do a booth,
my husband has a bad back.

02:44.232 --> 02:46.534
He's got to sit in a chair
like a human being.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.202
This is way too close
to the bathroom.

02:48.736 --> 02:50.103
It has a wobble.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.605
Hello? Ah.

02:52.640 --> 02:53.674
There's an echo.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.543
This just has a bad vibe.

02:58.646 --> 03:00.914
ADULT ADAM: Every meal with
the Goldbergs began the same.

03:00.981 --> 03:03.584
First, my dad would ravenously
attack the bread basket.

03:03.651 --> 03:05.919
Followed by this
classic mom response.

03:05.986 --> 03:08.222
No, Murray! No!
One roll for you only.

03:08.289 --> 03:09.357
The same goes
for the rest of you.

03:09.423 --> 03:11.292
I will not have you
filling up on bread.

03:11.359 --> 03:12.793
What's with your mom
and the rolls?

03:12.860 --> 03:14.695
He worst fear in life
is that we'll
fill up on bread.

03:14.762 --> 03:16.464
But she also can't let
anything go to waste.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.432
So that's where her
food purse comes in.

03:18.499 --> 03:19.667
Food what now?

03:19.733 --> 03:21.369
ERICA: It's a bottomless purse
lined with foil.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.337
Oh, hi. We need
some more rolls.

03:23.404 --> 03:24.738
Oh, I'm not your waiter,
but I'll tell him.

03:24.805 --> 03:27.708
Wait! It says free refills.
I'll have a sprite.

03:27.775 --> 03:30.478
Oh, again.
I'm not your waiter,
but I'll let him know.

03:30.544 --> 03:34.047
Whoo-hoo! This family now
has a bottomless soda.

03:34.114 --> 03:35.949
We're beating the system.

03:36.016 --> 03:38.519
ADULT ADAM: Next, Barry
would have his traditional
middle child meltdown

03:38.586 --> 03:40.521
over the struggles
of being left handed.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.623
Damn it, Geoff, stop!
What?

03:42.690 --> 03:45.726
You're masing your
dominant hand into mine!

03:45.793 --> 03:47.395
I can't eat like this!

03:47.461 --> 03:49.963
Ignore him. Barry just
acts like a big baby
because he's a lefty.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.832
You don't know
the pain of the southpaw.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.867
I feel like a left handed
prisoner of war.

03:53.934 --> 03:55.703
Geoff, switch me!

03:55.769 --> 03:58.272
Enough. You're sitting
where you're sitting.

03:58.339 --> 04:00.274
Ooh, it's a cheddar biscuit.

04:00.341 --> 04:01.342
No, Murray, no!

04:04.578 --> 04:06.179
ADULT ADAM: It was now
decision making time.

04:06.246 --> 04:10.250
And for my dad,
the only choice was
how to save money.

04:10.318 --> 04:13.621
Okay. It's time for
Murray's menu rules.

04:13.687 --> 04:16.023
Remember, no prime cuts,

04:16.089 --> 04:17.725
no fancy sides.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.960
No out of season vegetables.

04:20.027 --> 04:21.194
No market price.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.797
No salad bar.
No items in French.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.866
No dry aged anything.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.535
And most importantly...

04:27.601 --> 04:31.138
ALL: No appetizers of
any kind 'cause
that's how they screw you.

04:31.204 --> 04:33.907
Does that include
a nice soup?

04:33.974 --> 04:36.009
Are you for real?
Is he for real?

04:36.076 --> 04:38.379
You're gonna eat a little meal
before you eat a big meal?

04:38.446 --> 04:39.580
How many meals do you need?

04:39.647 --> 04:41.649
Dad, stop it. If Geoff
wants a cup of soup,

04:41.715 --> 04:43.050
let him get a cup of soup!

04:43.116 --> 04:45.152
I don't need the soup.
I'm... I'm sorry
I even brought it up.

04:45.218 --> 04:47.020
You know what,
I don't trust anyone.
Hand me your spoons.

04:47.087 --> 04:50.090
Murray, it's a special night.
Let the kids order
whatever they want.

04:50.157 --> 04:52.025
Yes! I'm gonna get
the Porterhouse.

04:52.092 --> 04:54.027
Everyone but you.
Excuse me, waiter.

04:54.094 --> 04:57.064
Yoo-hoo! Can we have
a children's menu
for my baby?

04:57.130 --> 05:00.033
Oh, again,
I'm not your waiter.
But, uh, I'll let him know.

05:00.100 --> 05:03.303
Mom! That menu is specifically
for kids eight and under.

05:03.371 --> 05:06.239
I'm in high school now.
No one's gonna buy
this act anymore.

05:06.306 --> 05:09.777
Hey, moron. I'm not paying
for you to get a steak
and eat three bites.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.812
Daddy's right,
you may be a big boy

05:11.879 --> 05:13.481
but you've still got
a little boy belly.

05:13.547 --> 05:16.684
Here you go, buckaroo,
and here's a cup with a lid.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.486
ADAM: Thanks.
I know it's an octopus

05:18.552 --> 05:19.887
but I'm gonna connect
the dots anyway.

05:19.953 --> 05:22.356
I'm sorry.
Stop apologizing. We're fine.

05:22.423 --> 05:25.025
Fine
We haven't even
begun, Geoff.

05:25.092 --> 05:26.827
We haven't?
Not at all.

05:26.894 --> 05:29.897
Because after we sit,
we order.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.467
Waiter, we're ready
to order.

05:33.534 --> 05:37.104
Got ya. I mean,
I'm not your waiter
but, uh, I'll just take it.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.472
Great, my husband here
will have...

05:38.539 --> 05:41.008
Bup-bup-bup. What's with you
always ordering for me?

05:41.074 --> 05:42.342
I know what you like.

05:42.410 --> 05:45.245
And I don't? I'll order
my own damn meal, thank you.

05:45.312 --> 05:46.980
I'll have the, uh...

05:47.047 --> 05:49.483
ADULT ADAM:
Whenever it came time to order
my dad had this crazy glitch,

05:49.550 --> 05:51.819
where he would
immediately forget
what he liked or wanted.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.220
Ah, come back to me.

05:53.286 --> 05:55.088
My grandfather also had
his own way of ordering.

05:55.155 --> 05:56.356
Excuse me?

05:56.424 --> 05:58.526
Befriending anyone
within a ten table radius.

05:58.592 --> 06:01.261
What's that
golden hunk of meat
you're enjoying there?

06:01.328 --> 06:02.362
It's a pork chop.

06:02.430 --> 06:03.564
Is it good?
Very.

06:03.631 --> 06:05.032
I'm not in the mood
for trafe.

06:05.098 --> 06:06.834
What about your
handsome friend?

06:06.900 --> 06:09.503
What are you working with?
Is that some kind of pilaf?

06:09.570 --> 06:11.171
It's wild rice.

06:11.238 --> 06:14.875
You go, Adam. I get
a feeling these people
have a story to tell.

06:14.942 --> 06:19.713
I'll have
the Li'l wrangler dog
and apple sauce.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.649
Sorry. Children's menu
is eight and under.

06:21.715 --> 06:22.850
He is eight and under.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.518
Yes, I'm this much.

06:24.585 --> 06:27.921
All right,
wrangler dog it is.
And what can I get you?

06:27.988 --> 06:29.222
ADULT ADAM:
And then there was Barry.

06:29.289 --> 06:32.059
Without fail he'd always order
the wrong thing.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.828
You know what?
I think I'm havin'
a nice piece of fish.

06:34.895 --> 06:38.432
No. Stop right there.
This is Beefsteak Charlie's.

06:38.499 --> 06:41.168
Steak is in the name,
that means no fish.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.070
How's your steamed trout?

06:43.136 --> 06:44.137
It's not great.

06:44.204 --> 06:45.839
Heard ya loud and clear.
Trout me.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.475
Dude, no. Don't do this.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.276
Well, since you've
all been such jerks,

06:49.342 --> 06:51.712
I won't be sharing
my delicious trout
with any of you.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.380
ADULT ADAM: And with
Barry's stubborn defiance

06:53.447 --> 06:55.783
came my chance
to stage my own revolt.

06:55.849 --> 06:58.018
Done! I was right.

06:58.085 --> 07:01.288
It's an octopus with a lasso
but my childhood ends here.

07:01.354 --> 07:03.657
Garson, bring me
the biggest steak you got.

07:03.724 --> 07:06.727
No, Adam, no.
You're tummy can't handle
that big boy food,

07:06.794 --> 07:08.962
it'll destroy your
insides and tushie.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.499
I'm taking a stand,
I'm a grown ass man

07:11.565 --> 07:13.366
and I know how to man
my big honk and meats.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.803
Fine. But if you
don't finish it
so help me God.

07:15.869 --> 07:18.138
Ready now, sir?
I'll have the come back to me.

07:18.205 --> 07:21.241
And what can... Uh...
Sir

07:21.308 --> 07:25.746
Hold on. I'm talking to
Donald and Vicki over here
about their potato.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.414
Okay, you know what?
I will just go.

07:27.481 --> 07:30.383
I will have the rib eye,
and a side of corn bread.
Geoff, order.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.622
Um...

07:34.688 --> 07:37.357
Just, um, some...
Some soup.

07:37.424 --> 07:38.959
I'm sorry, what's that?
Soup.

07:39.026 --> 07:40.193
I can't really get you.
Soup.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.328
Are you saying snook?

07:41.394 --> 07:42.696
Soup. He'll have the soup,

07:42.763 --> 07:44.998
French onion,
a bowl not a cup.
Deal with it.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.167
Are you trying to ruin
the entire night?

07:47.234 --> 07:48.602
And, uh, what else
can I get for you?

07:48.669 --> 07:50.838
No, that's, that's it, just...
Just the soup.

07:51.371 --> 07:52.405
Decided yet?

07:52.472 --> 07:54.074
I finally got it.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.609
Goddamn it, come back to me.

07:55.676 --> 07:56.810
Okay, ma'am?

07:56.877 --> 07:58.679
Okay, write this down
very carefully.

07:58.746 --> 08:01.214
I would like the sirloin,
medium plus,

08:01.281 --> 08:03.483
with garlic butter sauce
on the side.

08:03.551 --> 08:05.285
I would like
the vegetable medley,

08:05.352 --> 08:08.556
but instead of asparagus,
I would like six pieces
of shrimp.

08:08.622 --> 08:13.193
We don't substitute shrimp
for vegetables.

08:13.260 --> 08:16.897
Oh, that changes everything.

08:16.964 --> 08:19.232
My God. Here we go.
What's wrong now?

08:19.299 --> 08:21.068
It takes my mom
ten minutes to order.

08:21.134 --> 08:23.503
To her, the menu is just
a vague suggestion.

08:23.571 --> 08:26.239
I would like the hanger steak
Pittsburgh style,

08:26.306 --> 08:29.242
but instead of
bearnaise sauce,
I would like crab cakes.

08:29.309 --> 08:33.146
We also don't
swap out sauces
for actual food.

08:33.213 --> 08:35.883
Okay, got a whole lot of rules
that don't make any sense.

08:35.949 --> 08:37.350
All right, here's what
we're gonna do.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.419
I would like sirloin,
medium plus

08:39.486 --> 08:41.555
with garlic butter sauce
on the side.

08:41.622 --> 08:42.990
Okay, let's start over.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.926
I would like a baked potato
with sour cream and chives

08:45.993 --> 08:48.428
but extra sour cream
on the side.

08:48.495 --> 08:52.165
I would like a petite fillet,
a large petite fillet,

08:52.232 --> 08:55.468
red peppers
and beans and asparagus

08:55.535 --> 08:58.606
and cream spinach
and add the horse radish
on the side

08:58.672 --> 09:01.108
but I'm not, like, starving
so cut the potato in half

09:01.174 --> 09:02.810
and put half of that to go.

09:05.078 --> 09:07.748
And all the mushrooms
you have.

09:07.815 --> 09:09.082
Perfect.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.418
You sir, you look like
you're ready to order.

09:11.484 --> 09:12.886
Uh, please come back to me.

09:12.953 --> 09:15.188
There's no one left.
Just pick your meat already.

09:15.255 --> 09:16.924
Why don't I just come back
in a few minutes and...

09:16.990 --> 09:20.493
No, we're too far in.
He'll have the T-bone
a little pink inside.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.030
Oh, yeah.
That is what I like.
All right.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.765
Oh. I almost forgot,

09:24.832 --> 09:26.834
it's our daughter
Erica's birthday today

09:26.900 --> 09:29.637
and I believe that means
we get a free piece of cake.

09:29.703 --> 09:31.304
Absolutely.
Dad, stop.

09:31.371 --> 09:33.073
And by the way,
it's his birthday too.
Me?

09:33.140 --> 09:36.343
They're twins. They'll have
two free big pieces of cake.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.445
Well, happy birthday
to both of you.

09:38.511 --> 09:40.948
I'm sorry.
Baby, it's fine. Ow.

09:41.014 --> 09:42.983
Hands off. You're twins.

09:43.050 --> 09:44.284
Ouch, my kidney.
I...

09:44.351 --> 09:45.753
ERICA: Barry, stop elbowing.
May I take your order?

09:45.819 --> 09:47.554
No, Marc, no.
Just walk away.
ERICA: Stop elbowing.

09:47.621 --> 09:49.089
You got
a sweet Hawaiian roll.

09:49.156 --> 09:50.357
No, Murray, no.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.426
Hey, look at the size of
Garry's giant fillet.

09:53.493 --> 09:55.729
I just wanna drink
this soda
like a human being.

09:55.796 --> 09:58.331
Oh, God! It's so cold,
but I'm fine.

09:58.398 --> 10:00.367
Waiter, refill on the soda.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.970
And rolls,
and sugar packets
and more rolls.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.504
ADULT ADAM: It seemed
like dinner hit
rock bottom,

10:04.571 --> 10:06.506
but it was gonna get
much worse.

10:08.709 --> 10:11.011
Geoff had gotten a taste of
dinner with the Goldbergs,

10:11.078 --> 10:13.246
but the worst
was yet to come.

10:13.313 --> 10:14.948
God. I know exactly
what's gonna happen,

10:15.015 --> 10:16.516
but it's still a nightmare
to live through.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.819
You gotta calm down, okay?
Honestly, you're
making it worse.

10:18.886 --> 10:20.788
Me

10:20.854 --> 10:22.622
It's just,
you're so yelly.

10:22.690 --> 10:24.324
Yeah. I'm trying
to protect you.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.794
I don't need protecting.
Just chill out a little.

10:26.860 --> 10:29.029
Fine. From here on out,
you're on your own

10:29.096 --> 10:31.231
and believe me,
the worst is yet to come.

10:31.298 --> 10:34.134
Hey, no salad bar.
That counts as an appetizer.

10:34.201 --> 10:35.903
I tried, buddy.
Good luck.

10:38.538 --> 10:39.740
ADULT ADAM:
After we ordered dinner,

10:39.807 --> 10:40.874
came the hardest part
of the meal

10:40.941 --> 10:43.043
for my
impatient family, waiting.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.245
I cannot believe
our food isn't here.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.880
Must be some kind of
a mistake.

10:46.947 --> 10:49.950
Excuse me, I can't see
our waiter anywhere.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.551
No, that's me,
I'm your waiter.

10:51.618 --> 10:53.153
Remember, Marc?

10:53.220 --> 10:56.123
All the tables
that ordered after us,
already got their food.

10:56.189 --> 10:59.126
First we ordered.
Then that table,
then them.

10:59.192 --> 11:03.063
ADULT ADAM: Like all mothers,
my mom watched each table
order like a hawk

11:03.130 --> 11:05.098
so she knew when it was
our turn to get served.

11:05.165 --> 11:08.535
Then them, then them
and then that big group
over there with my dad.

11:08.601 --> 11:10.537
They have names, Bevy.

11:10.603 --> 11:15.008
This is Doug and Fran
and Lee-Ann
and little Bobby.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.376
I'll check on it
right away, ma'am.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.248
Oh, I'm getting shaky hungry.
I'm gonna have some rolls.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.550
No, Murray, no.
Do not touch the rolls.

11:23.616 --> 11:26.519
Oh, wait. Finally.
Here it comes.

11:26.586 --> 11:29.890
ADULT ADAM: At long last,
our piping hot dinner
was on its way to my family.

11:29.957 --> 11:33.326
And we would feast upon
Beefsteak Charlie's
finest meats.

11:33.393 --> 11:35.729
And... Still not our order.

11:37.064 --> 11:39.266
What in
the actual !

11:39.332 --> 11:42.002
That waiter just
gave them our
food by mistake.

11:42.069 --> 11:43.103
Those bastards.

11:43.170 --> 11:44.271
We gotta get our food.

11:44.337 --> 11:45.939
Wait, like go take it
from them.

11:46.006 --> 11:47.574
I want my fish.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.443
I'm getting shaky hungry.
I can't wait.
I gotta eat the rolls.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.880
Don't touch the rolls.
Geoff, Barry, let's go.

11:52.946 --> 11:55.148
Really? Get the food
from those poor people?

11:55.215 --> 11:57.050
ADULT ADAM: Okay,
you may not believe
what happened next,

11:57.117 --> 11:59.052
but this is all true,
this happened.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.888
Hi, hello.
Uh, you have our food

12:00.954 --> 12:02.489
so we're just going to
take that out of your way.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.324
Are you sure?
Uh, yeah.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.093
We ordered first
and look at this.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.995
That's medium plus,
that's what I ordered.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.729
That's rare.
These are ours.
Yeah.

12:09.797 --> 12:10.798
Sorry about the mix-up.

12:11.932 --> 12:14.167
Oh, boy.
Everybody look away

12:14.234 --> 12:15.735
'cause this is not
gonna be pretty.

12:15.803 --> 12:17.771
Damn it. I waited
this whole time

12:17.838 --> 12:19.206
and they still don't have
my dinner.

12:19.272 --> 12:22.309
Waiter, excuse me.
My boy never got
his river fish.

12:22.375 --> 12:24.978
I'm not your waiter
and where did this
come from?

12:25.045 --> 12:26.279
They took it
from our table.

12:26.346 --> 12:27.948
Ma'am, this is not
your food.

12:28.015 --> 12:30.717
Oh, no. Did we just touch
and steal food
from those nice people?

12:30.784 --> 12:34.021
Okay, here we go every...
Oh, boy.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.523
ADULT ADAM: And that's when
our dinner really did arrive.

12:36.589 --> 12:40.627
Uh, hi, hello.
Over here.

12:40.693 --> 12:43.931
So sorry about the mix-up,
you can just come and take
your food back.

12:43.997 --> 12:45.165
No. You poked it.

12:45.232 --> 12:46.399
Well, it was just
a little poke.

12:46.466 --> 12:47.835
Uh, I didn't
poke anything.

12:47.901 --> 12:50.637
But I did.
I jammed my thumb
in there like a champ.

12:50.703 --> 12:51.905
Many apologies, sir.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.306
We'll rush out
another order.

12:53.373 --> 12:54.641
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going
with that?

12:54.707 --> 12:56.910
To throw it out.
No, that's a waste.

12:56.977 --> 12:58.711
Pack it up.
We'll take it to go.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.048
You want to take home
the meal that wasn't yours?

13:01.114 --> 13:03.250
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're gonna throw it
in a big garbage bag.

13:03.316 --> 13:04.985
Why don't you put it
in a little doggie bag?
We'll take it.

13:05.052 --> 13:06.820
Okay, now he's
actively stealing.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.756
Don't look at me.
I'm busy enjoying
the other table's fries.

13:09.823 --> 13:12.459
Sure, it's no problem.
We'll wrap all of this.

13:16.263 --> 13:19.032
ADULT ADAM: For my family,
dining out wasn't about
the quality of the food,

13:19.099 --> 13:20.700
it was about the quantity.

13:20.767 --> 13:22.802
And it was best expressed
with one word.

13:22.870 --> 13:24.304
The portions, huh?

13:24.371 --> 13:26.373
Such big portions.

13:26.439 --> 13:27.674
The biggest portions
in town.

13:27.740 --> 13:29.776
Can you believe
the portions?

13:29.843 --> 13:31.211
I don't like
my large portion.

13:31.278 --> 13:32.712
This portion's not good.

13:32.779 --> 13:34.381
My portion's, like, huge.

13:34.447 --> 13:36.884
Why are there
three baked potatoes
on here too?

13:36.950 --> 13:38.318
It's madness.

13:38.385 --> 13:40.453
Psst! I'll trade you
this fish for anything
you got.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.289
Dude, if I don't eat
this while giant steak,

13:42.355 --> 13:44.858
Mom's never gonna
let me order
off the adult menu again.

13:46.593 --> 13:49.129
What's going with you?
Is your little tummy
full already?

13:49.196 --> 13:51.899
Nope. Barry's just mad
'cause I'm gonna finish this
all on my own.

13:51.965 --> 13:53.533
I told you
not to get that fish.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.169
Geoff. I'm your best friend,

13:56.236 --> 13:58.571
pour half of your soup
into my glass.

13:58.638 --> 13:59.839
Geoff, do not.

13:59.907 --> 14:01.308
I'm so hungry, please.

14:01.374 --> 14:03.643
He knew better
than to order trout
at a steak house.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.245
Don't support
his bad judgment.

14:05.312 --> 14:06.947
Erica, please help me.

14:07.014 --> 14:08.949
I wouldn't worry about it.
Everything's gonna be
sent back anyway.

14:09.016 --> 14:10.050
What do you mean?

14:10.117 --> 14:11.651
Oh, it's all going back.
You'll see.

14:11.718 --> 14:13.286
I don't wanna see.
Just tell me
what's gonna ha...

14:15.923 --> 14:18.926
ADULT ADAM: We finally began
our meal and it tasted
damn fine.

14:18.992 --> 14:22.762
But fine was not good enough
for my mom
who always did this.

14:22.829 --> 14:26.133
Excuse me, waiter.
Ugh. My fries are ice cold.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.135
Hi, I kinda switched
with Alex

14:28.201 --> 14:29.569
'cause you keep
ordering from him.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.338
Feel them, ice cold.

14:31.404 --> 14:35.208
Also, I ordered the T-bone
a little pink inside,
but it's way overdone.

14:35.275 --> 14:36.709
I'll fix both of yours
right away.

14:36.776 --> 14:40.313
Geoff, didn't you order
a bowl of soup?
That's a cup.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.182
No, I'm fine,
totally fine.

14:42.249 --> 14:44.284
It's not a problem.
I'll take it back
and make sure it's right.

14:44.351 --> 14:45.585
If things are getting
sent back,

14:45.652 --> 14:47.754
maybe I should get
the petite filet

14:47.820 --> 14:49.689
instead of this
Longhorn Gutbuster?

14:49.756 --> 14:52.025
Also please take back
this stinky fish.

14:52.092 --> 14:55.028
Oh, no. You got the fish,
you keep the fish.

14:55.095 --> 14:56.964
You all get to send back
for new meat

14:57.030 --> 14:59.632
and I'm stuck with
this old soggy trout?

14:59.699 --> 15:02.069
Do me a favor,
uh, wrap that up,
we'll take it.

15:02.135 --> 15:04.771
You want me to wrap up
the food you don't like?

15:04.837 --> 15:07.607
What is it with
this restaurant
and wasting food?

15:07.674 --> 15:09.176
We'll also have
a refill on the soda.

15:09.242 --> 15:12.112
And more rolls and straws and
Sweet'n Low and more rolls.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.548
ADULT ADAM: Like always,
Barry hated his order.

15:15.615 --> 15:18.751
As for the rest of us,
we finally stopped yelling
and started eating.

15:18.818 --> 15:20.153
At this point,
my hungry dad

15:20.220 --> 15:22.022
would go into
a blissful food zone,

15:22.089 --> 15:23.690
and then,
this would happen.

15:24.891 --> 15:25.925
He'd choke.

15:25.993 --> 15:27.694
Um, is your father okay?

15:27.760 --> 15:30.197
Eh, he's fine.
This is just what he does
when he gets in the zone.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.065
But he's choking.
He'll power through it.

15:32.132 --> 15:33.366
Doesn't seem like he will.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.302
Trust us,
there's plenty of air
going around the meat.

15:35.368 --> 15:36.603
There's no air.

15:36.669 --> 15:38.338
Look at him.
This is a full-on
real choke.

15:38.405 --> 15:41.508
No. Look, he's trying
to put mushrooms
on his fork right now.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.476
Why is he doing that?
Why does he continue to feed?

15:43.543 --> 15:44.744
The man is dying.

15:44.811 --> 15:46.046
What's with all the hubba?

15:46.113 --> 15:48.081
I can't just sit here
and let him choke like this.

15:48.148 --> 15:51.884
Against my better judgment,
I'm letting you know that this
is the happiest my dad gets.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.888
Don't worry, Mr. G.
I'm a lifeguard at the JCC.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.690
Arms up.
Find the sternum.

15:57.757 --> 15:58.758
Don't find the sternum.

15:58.825 --> 16:01.028
Why are you touching me?
Don't touch me.

16:01.094 --> 16:02.129
GEOFF: I'm trying
to save your life.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.131
Why? Sit down.

16:04.197 --> 16:07.600
ADULT ADAM: And with that,
the Goldberg's officially
broke the sweetest

16:07.667 --> 16:08.768
boyfriend in the world.

16:08.835 --> 16:10.270
Waiter. Over here.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.539
No. This has
never been our waiter.

16:12.605 --> 16:15.275
Look at his face.
He's an entirely
different person.

16:15.342 --> 16:16.876
Geoff. You're making a scene.

16:16.943 --> 16:18.578
Oh, right.
Because the last
thing we want

16:18.645 --> 16:20.313
is some unwanted
negative attention.

16:20.380 --> 16:23.416
This family should be
barred from any and all
dining establishments.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.185
I'm talkin'
Beefsteak Charlie's,

16:25.252 --> 16:27.854
China Garden, Applebee's,
even Tony Roma's.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.589
I hear they make
a top-notch shrimp scampi.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.891
Oh, my God.
At a steak place
you get steak

16:31.958 --> 16:34.561
and in a place for ribs,
you eat ribs with your
dominant hand

16:34.627 --> 16:36.863
without complaining
that the world is
prejudiced against you.

16:36.929 --> 16:38.565
Burn. He got you good.

16:38.631 --> 16:40.267
And you. You know,
despite your age,

16:40.333 --> 16:41.968
you still sound look like
and sound like a tiny boy,

16:42.035 --> 16:43.170
so just order accordingly.

16:43.236 --> 16:45.205
He's right,
you barely touched steak.

16:45.272 --> 16:48.041
And, you.
You turned your purse
into a mini fridge.

16:48.108 --> 16:49.542
You took an hour to order,

16:49.609 --> 16:52.079
then stole food
from that table
and then sent it back.

16:52.145 --> 16:56.049
Hey. We're trying
to enjoy Devon's
graduation dinner in peace.

16:56.116 --> 16:57.717
And you.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.619
That's just a nice family
trying to have a special
meal together.

16:59.686 --> 17:00.687
Leave them alone.

17:00.753 --> 17:01.921
What's captain soup
going on about?

17:01.988 --> 17:03.256
And you.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.825
With your menu rules
and your communal soda

17:05.892 --> 17:07.860
and your forcing me
to just eat soup.

17:07.927 --> 17:09.262
You think
I didn't want steak?

17:09.329 --> 17:10.563
I chose this place.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.299
I love their meats
and their sides

17:12.365 --> 17:15.568
and why do you keep
eating through everything
I'm saying right now?

17:15.635 --> 17:17.537
You know,
you really are ruining
our good people's name

17:17.604 --> 17:19.005
and you know
what I'm talking about.

17:19.072 --> 17:22.075
* Happy birthday to you

17:22.142 --> 17:25.078
* Happy birthday to you

17:25.145 --> 17:29.316
* Happy birthday
Erica and Geoff

17:29.382 --> 17:33.820
* Happy birthday
to both of you *

17:38.891 --> 17:40.860
ADULT ADAM: It was time
for the final stage of dinner,

17:40.927 --> 17:42.862
the moment Beverly
ceased to be a mother

17:42.929 --> 17:45.598
and became the world's
greatest forensic accountant.

17:48.135 --> 17:50.170
Well, it's a good thing
I travel with my calculator

17:50.237 --> 17:52.705
because we are being
aggressively overcharged.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.241
Okay, the cake is free,

17:54.307 --> 17:55.508
double check there's
no cake out there.
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

17:55.575 --> 17:56.876
I'm gonna go outside.
BEVERLY: Waiter,

17:56.943 --> 17:59.212
it says we're being
charged for a larger steak

17:59.279 --> 18:01.114
when my son switched
to the petite.

18:01.181 --> 18:03.150
And don't forget
one soda, make sure.

18:03.216 --> 18:06.153
Also you said
you'd take off
for the icy cold fries.

18:06.219 --> 18:09.822
Zero cake, one soda,
triple check.

18:09.889 --> 18:11.558
All right, Murray,
you're just slowing me down.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.193
All right,
which one of you
is the waiter?

18:13.260 --> 18:14.394
I'll tell you who
your waiter was.

18:14.461 --> 18:15.595
No, no, Alex,
it's not worth it.

18:15.662 --> 18:17.397
You're right, you're right.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.034
Hey.

18:24.237 --> 18:26.906
Look, I don't need
to hear I told you so.

18:26.973 --> 18:29.142
I just wanted to be
closer to your family,

18:29.209 --> 18:31.344
but I made a mess
of everything.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.147
No. You didn't.

18:34.214 --> 18:36.115
Look, I have
to admit something.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.652
I love you,
but I never thought

18:39.719 --> 18:43.022
that we could go the distance
because I didn't think you
could handle my family.

18:43.890 --> 18:44.924
But...

18:44.991 --> 18:49.729
Man, the way you stood
up to them was awesome.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.431
You're one of us, Geoff.

18:52.332 --> 18:53.333
You think?

18:54.033 --> 18:55.034
I know.

18:55.868 --> 18:56.869
MURRAY: Bap-bap.

18:56.936 --> 18:59.272
Remember,
you guys are twins.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.674
Keep the lie up
until I get my
credit card back.

19:01.741 --> 19:03.075
We're having a moment, Dad.

19:03.142 --> 19:06.746
I need to have a moment
with Soupy Sales if you
don't mind.

19:06.813 --> 19:09.582
Don't worry.
I'll be very nice.
I promise.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.590
Look, before
you say anything,

19:17.657 --> 19:21.228
just let me apologize for,
you know, grabbing you

19:21.294 --> 19:24.130
and yelling at you
and suggesting that
you're a thief.

19:24.197 --> 19:26.366
What are you
apologizing for?

19:26.433 --> 19:29.035
That's what happens
at all our dinners.

19:29.101 --> 19:31.971
So you're not mad?
Even about the soup?

19:32.038 --> 19:36.142
The next time,
you can have soup
and an entree.

19:37.109 --> 19:38.911
Wow, that's...

19:38.978 --> 19:40.012
Really?

19:40.079 --> 19:42.582
Just don't tell the others.

19:42.649 --> 19:44.851
ADULT ADAM: That night,
Geoff did the impossible.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.886
He survived dinner
with the Goldbergs.

19:46.953 --> 19:49.556
But even better,
he gained my Dad's respect.

19:52.892 --> 19:56.028
Thank you for making
sure my schmoo had
a great birthday.

19:56.095 --> 19:57.430
It was a special night.

19:57.497 --> 20:00.267
Yeah, I certainly
will never forget it.

20:06.406 --> 20:07.907
GEOFF: And they're gone.

20:07.974 --> 20:10.443
At least until they realize,
they left Pops inside.

20:10.510 --> 20:13.846
Wait, he's still in there
talking to that couple
that just got engaged?

20:13.913 --> 20:15.181
For sure.

20:15.248 --> 20:17.016
So do you wanna go
get actual food now?

20:17.083 --> 20:20.420
Yeah, all I had was soup
and Barry stole half of it.

20:20.487 --> 20:23.256
ADULT ADAM: In the end,
this dinner with the Goldbergs
was just like any other.

20:23.323 --> 20:25.858
It was noisy, messy,
highly embarrassing

20:25.925 --> 20:30.330
but somehow we always left
feeling closer and our
hearts filled with love.

20:30.397 --> 20:32.965
And my mom's purse
filled with rolls.

20:43.009 --> 20:44.611
MAN: Barry! Barry!

20:47.013 --> 20:50.016
WAITERS:
* Happy birthday to you

20:55.822 --> 20:57.424
Breakfast is served.

20:57.490 --> 21:01.328
The only thing better
than eating out is
leftovers the next day.

21:01.394 --> 21:04.497
Steak and eggs for you.
Steak and eggs for you
and for Barry,

21:04.564 --> 21:07.534
a fishy scramble made from
last night's half eaten trout.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.269
What? That thing should've
never left the restaurant.

21:10.337 --> 21:13.506
And let it go to waste.
Oh, no, mister. You eat
that fishy scramble.

21:13.573 --> 21:15.342
I don't want
the fishy scramble.

21:15.408 --> 21:17.610
You eat that fishy
scramble right now.

21:17.677 --> 21:19.245
Ugh!

21:19.312 --> 21:23.015
Mm. Wow. This fishy
scramble is yummy.

21:23.082 --> 21:24.684
Want to get on this, Adam?
I'm good.

21:24.751 --> 21:27.654
How about you old man?
It's like fish scramble
heaven over here.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.356
Please take that plate
away from me.

21:29.422 --> 21:30.757
Eat it!
