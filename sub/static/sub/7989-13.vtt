WEBVTT

00:00.031 --> 00:02.099
Previously, on "Shades of Blue"...

00:02.101 --> 00:04.756
You told me Miguel didn't
contact his parole officer.

00:04.781 --> 00:05.328
That's true.

00:05.375 --> 00:06.441
Miguel was exonerated.

00:06.443 --> 00:08.108
He doesn't even have a parole officer.

00:08.132 --> 00:10.133
Are you offering to
bankroll a fresh start?

00:10.135 --> 00:12.319
That's gonna cost a hell of a
lot more than a cop's salary.

00:12.344 --> 00:13.643
I can get it,

00:13.645 --> 00:15.145
but that has to happen
away from me and Cristina.

00:15.147 --> 00:17.080
- Hi, Dad.
- My name's Linklater.

00:17.082 --> 00:18.148
I'm a D.E.A. agent.

00:18.150 --> 00:21.124
Tomorrow we're gonna leverage a
kidnapped man to make this job happen.

00:21.194 --> 00:22.193
Up!

00:22.195 --> 00:23.795
Get your hands up! I called it in.

00:23.797 --> 00:25.764
Gun!

00:25.766 --> 00:27.399
- You're all under arrest!
- We're doing this for you.

00:27.401 --> 00:28.600
This isn't our heist.

00:28.602 --> 00:29.568
It's Donnie Pomp's,

00:29.570 --> 00:31.336
the Internal Affairs officer.

00:31.338 --> 00:33.725
He told Wozniak that
if we didn't do this,

00:33.772 --> 00:34.804
he'd put you and I in jail.

00:34.806 --> 00:36.306
I can only tell you what I saw.

00:36.308 --> 00:37.941
- But not who you saw?
- They were wearing masks.

00:37.943 --> 00:39.242
His throat's been slit.

00:39.244 --> 00:40.944
This wasn't supposed to happen.

00:40.946 --> 00:43.012
Somebody knew what they were doing.

00:43.014 --> 00:44.080
They took the money!

00:44.082 --> 00:45.148
You find me my money

00:45.150 --> 00:46.749
or you're gonna go down for all of this.

00:46.751 --> 00:48.117
Linklater, we've got him.

00:48.119 --> 00:50.453
That's not Linklater.

00:50.455 --> 00:51.621
What now?

00:51.623 --> 00:53.156
Now we start calling the shots.

00:54.376 --> 00:59.345

01:09.875 --> 01:13.076
So that's what the root
of all evil looks like.

01:13.078 --> 01:14.844
Behold, your share.

01:14.846 --> 01:16.646
I got involved to help you, Harlee.

01:16.648 --> 01:18.281
That kind of money would ruin me.

01:18.283 --> 01:19.415
Well, I'll invest it for you.

01:19.417 --> 01:21.317
Rent, groceries.

01:21.319 --> 01:24.387
Nothing in your arm.

01:24.389 --> 01:26.523
I didn't mean to flip the car.

01:26.525 --> 01:27.924
You did what you had to do.

01:27.926 --> 01:29.692
I told you to get this
money no matter what,

01:29.694 --> 01:31.094
and if any of this had made it

01:31.096 --> 01:33.930
to the drop with the FBI waiting,

01:33.932 --> 01:36.900
arrest warrants would already
be waiting for my crew.

01:36.902 --> 01:38.067
So now what?

01:38.069 --> 01:39.669
Buy an island and retire?

01:39.671 --> 01:40.770
No.

01:40.772 --> 01:43.072
Go home.

01:43.074 --> 01:45.341
Get some rest...

01:45.343 --> 01:46.709
and plan a sting.

01:47.879 --> 01:49.946
You had me heist the heist
and almost kill you

01:49.948 --> 01:51.047
so you can hand this right back over?

01:51.049 --> 01:53.616
No, you bought me time.

01:53.892 --> 01:55.792
I'm trading this for their immunity.

01:55.794 --> 01:56.993
But not all of it.

01:56.995 --> 01:59.429
A light 12 million.

01:59.431 --> 02:02.365
Whoever the hell
Linklater is and Donnie,

02:02.367 --> 02:03.633
it's gonna have to be enough.

02:03.635 --> 02:05.235
And you're not giving them Wozniak?

02:05.237 --> 02:08.305
I need Wozniak to find Linklater.

02:08.306 --> 02:10.507
How are you gonna make that happen?

02:10.508 --> 02:12.008
One last lie.

02:16.248 --> 02:19.015
You've reached Detective
Santos of the 64th precinct.

02:19.017 --> 02:21.284
If this is an emergency,
hang up and call 9-1...

02:57.990 --> 03:01.157
What do you say you buy
me a cup of coffee?

03:01.159 --> 03:03.627
I seem to be missing some cash.

03:03.629 --> 03:05.161
Maybe you can buy me one.

03:12.304 --> 03:13.303
Long day?

03:13.305 --> 03:16.506
Had its setbacks.

03:16.508 --> 03:17.641
Yours?

03:17.643 --> 03:18.808
It's not over yet.

03:18.810 --> 03:20.610
Oh, an optimist.

03:20.612 --> 03:21.711
I like that.

03:21.713 --> 03:22.779
Accentuate the positive.

03:22.781 --> 03:24.848
Like air in your lungs.

03:24.850 --> 03:27.684
Like unlimited federal resources,

03:27.686 --> 03:29.753
mountains of evidence, RICO Act.

03:32.391 --> 03:34.624
Well, then why don't you pay me a visit?

03:34.626 --> 03:37.294
I think there's some
kids menus and crayons

03:37.296 --> 03:39.062
around here, if you want to
scribble down a confession.

03:39.064 --> 03:41.998
First rule of big game hunting?

03:42.000 --> 03:43.300
Never get too close.

03:43.302 --> 03:46.269
Can I help you with
something, Lieutenant?

03:46.271 --> 03:50.240
Stay away from my crew.

03:50.242 --> 03:53.043
You led them here, chief.

03:57.215 --> 03:58.715
Whoa, what happened to you?

03:58.717 --> 04:01.284
Oh, just another day in the life.

04:01.286 --> 04:02.385
Couldn't sleep?

04:02.387 --> 04:04.054
Too many monsters under the bed.

04:04.056 --> 04:06.156
You're in luck. I just
had the place swept.

04:06.157 --> 04:08.691
I didn't know if you'd
want to see me again

04:08.694 --> 04:10.560
after I blamed you for Miguel's release.

04:10.562 --> 04:12.162
You had a right to be upset.

04:12.164 --> 04:15.498
But it wasn't your fault.

04:15.500 --> 04:17.399
I'm sorry I took it out on you.

04:21.940 --> 04:25.208
Can I just stand here for a while?

04:25.210 --> 04:27.877
Pretend I'm somebody else?

04:27.879 --> 04:29.813
For as long as you want.

04:45.998 --> 04:47.163
Hi.

04:47.165 --> 04:48.131
Hi.

04:48.133 --> 04:49.599
You're right.

04:49.601 --> 04:51.901
She doesn't respect me, I
shouldn't have to respect her.

04:53.972 --> 04:56.272
I'm done being
treated like a baby.

05:03.648 --> 05:05.548
What?

05:07.919 --> 05:10.687
You remind me so much of your mother.

05:12.758 --> 05:14.424
A little late for a booty
call, isn't it, Matt?

05:14.426 --> 05:16.393
How long, Donnie?

05:16.395 --> 05:18.628
When was the exact moment
you decided to play me?

05:18.630 --> 05:20.363
Just hand over the cash.

05:20.365 --> 05:21.765
We can figure a way past all this.

05:21.767 --> 05:23.233
From the beginning?

05:23.235 --> 05:24.267
Was any of it real?

05:24.269 --> 05:25.735
Ah, you're a big boy.

05:25.737 --> 05:27.437
I didn't make you do anything
you didn't want to do.

05:27.439 --> 05:29.739
You're leaving out a few key details.

05:40.786 --> 05:42.485
Admit it, Matt, you're insatiable.

05:42.487 --> 05:43.820
It's your curse.

05:43.822 --> 05:46.356
A house, a wife, a lover.

05:46.358 --> 05:49.426
Respect, power, none of it was enough.

05:49.428 --> 05:53.029
I dangled a score and like a pork chop

05:53.031 --> 05:55.799
in front of a dog, you came running.

05:55.801 --> 05:58.735
Well, you're not gonna
like it when I catch up.

05:58.737 --> 06:00.770
Yeah, I'll be waiting.

06:07.712 --> 06:09.746
Evening, detective.

06:09.748 --> 06:11.014
Lieutenant Wozniak isn't here.

06:11.016 --> 06:12.715
And what were you doing in his house?

06:12.717 --> 06:15.151
Fairly confident that that's
none of your concern.

06:15.153 --> 06:17.220
$12 million confident?

06:17.222 --> 06:19.055
Huh?

06:19.057 --> 06:20.423
I rolled up on the heist.

06:20.425 --> 06:21.791
I know you're leveraging my crew.

06:21.793 --> 06:23.893
Is that what they told you?

06:23.895 --> 06:27.030
I made an appointment
with Captain McManus.

06:30.435 --> 06:31.601
This ends now.

06:31.603 --> 06:33.803
You're an easy mark, Loman.

06:33.805 --> 06:37.040
Your crew has been lying to you.

06:37.042 --> 06:39.843
I am actively investigating them.

06:41.780 --> 06:43.146
Follow me.

06:43.148 --> 06:44.314
There's something you should see.

06:46.151 --> 06:48.284
Unlike you, I've never killed a man

06:48.286 --> 06:51.054
but if that's your concern...

06:51.056 --> 06:53.022
Easy, easy.

06:54.559 --> 06:56.626
Right?

06:56.628 --> 06:57.927
Now I know

06:57.929 --> 06:59.529
you've only been with Wozniak's unit

06:59.531 --> 07:01.097
for a couple weeks,

07:01.099 --> 07:03.833
but you're not blind
and you're not stupid.

07:03.835 --> 07:05.034
You know they're dirty.

07:06.905 --> 07:09.906
I'm gonna show you just how much.

07:12.544 --> 07:14.677
If this is an investigation
then where's your warrant?

07:14.679 --> 07:16.012
Exigent circumstances.

07:16.014 --> 07:18.848
We believe he may be
holding a kidnapped man.

07:20.185 --> 07:22.218
Wozniak was a Marine.

07:22.220 --> 07:24.287
He ever mention that?

07:24.289 --> 07:25.321
Once.

07:27.058 --> 07:29.659
Romantic bunch, Marines.

07:29.661 --> 07:31.928
They all have keepsake boxes,

07:31.930 --> 07:34.631
memorialize their time in the Corps.

07:34.633 --> 07:37.767
The simplicity of service
has its appeal, I guess.

07:37.769 --> 07:41.404
Brotherhood, loyalty,

07:41.406 --> 07:43.973
but loyalty has its downside.

08:54.438 --> 08:57.739
It was, um, self-defense.

08:59.643 --> 09:01.777
In my kitchen?

09:04.582 --> 09:07.549
Drink it.

09:07.551 --> 09:10.152
Trust me.

09:17.061 --> 09:18.560
Woz...

09:18.562 --> 09:21.830
I came here...

09:21.832 --> 09:24.733
to tell you that I should've
followed my gut, okay?

09:24.735 --> 09:26.802
I should've come clean
about the shooting.

09:26.804 --> 09:29.338
All right, I just need a plan
to get you and Harlee clear.

09:29.340 --> 09:30.973
I didn't want you on the hook.

09:30.975 --> 09:32.841
On the hook?

09:32.843 --> 09:35.310
I haven't thanked you for
keeping your mouth shut

09:35.312 --> 09:38.780
with the Feds, and now
I owe you for this.

09:38.782 --> 09:42.751
- Another killing?
- He was looking for dirt.

09:42.753 --> 09:44.386
He was setting me up.

09:45.956 --> 09:51.293
The only question is how
do you want to play it?

09:51.295 --> 09:52.394
You're asking me?

09:52.396 --> 09:53.929
Yeah, it's your dead body.

09:53.931 --> 09:55.063
It's your decision.

09:56.800 --> 09:59.935
A rookie officer with an
Internal Affairs probe

09:59.937 --> 10:01.670
calls in a self-defense casualty

10:01.672 --> 10:04.206
on the guy who's running
the investigation.

10:04.208 --> 10:06.408
Yeah, the
headline doesn't read great

10:06.410 --> 10:09.544
but, Loman,

10:09.546 --> 10:11.813
it's the truth.

10:17.187 --> 10:20.656
The truth is in the paperwork.

10:20.658 --> 10:25.627
Internal Affairs looks after
their own, same as us.

10:25.629 --> 10:26.762
So?

10:31.068 --> 10:33.735
So I guess we have a
long night ahead of us.

10:40.644 --> 10:42.811
Bang.

10:42.813 --> 10:44.746
That's all I had to do.

10:44.748 --> 10:45.714
Open a door,

10:45.716 --> 10:48.684
shoot a bad guy, save a life.

10:48.686 --> 10:51.353
Donnie Pomp slit the
throat of that hostage

10:51.355 --> 10:53.088
while I was right outside the door.

10:53.090 --> 10:54.623
I could've gotten to him.

10:54.625 --> 10:56.191
Or he shoots you first,

10:56.193 --> 10:58.327
and I'm the one drinking
myself into oblivion tonight.

10:58.329 --> 10:59.928
Oh, please.

10:59.930 --> 11:02.164
You'd be celebrating.

11:02.166 --> 11:04.266
You think I'm uptight.

11:04.268 --> 11:05.434
Rigid.

11:05.436 --> 11:07.803
I'm gonna tell you a secret.

11:07.805 --> 11:09.805
If you'd stepped in there,
you shot the bad guy...

11:09.807 --> 11:10.972
Mm-hmm?

11:10.974 --> 11:13.342
You wouldn't be sleeping
any better tonight.

11:14.812 --> 11:16.111
It's the job.

11:16.113 --> 11:18.413
It's... it's never easy
and it's never clean.

11:18.415 --> 11:22.017
So how do you deal?

11:24.054 --> 11:26.221
Distractions.

11:26.223 --> 11:28.623
Do they work?

11:41.638 --> 11:44.306
Hey, how is she?

11:45.943 --> 11:47.242
What, Linda, slow down.

11:47.244 --> 11:49.344
When?

11:49.346 --> 11:52.647
Well, is she answering her phone?

11:52.649 --> 11:53.915
All right, stay at the hotel.

11:53.917 --> 11:55.917
Call me if she comes back.

11:58.422 --> 11:59.388
What's going on?

11:59.390 --> 12:00.489
Harlee, who's Linda?

12:00.491 --> 12:01.757
Wozniak's wife.

12:01.759 --> 12:03.425
- She's at a hotel?
- With Cristina.

12:03.427 --> 12:05.093
Is that who's gone, Cristina?

12:05.095 --> 12:06.895
She's not gone.

12:06.897 --> 12:07.863
He took her.

12:07.865 --> 12:10.465
Wait, I'm going with you.

12:18.742 --> 12:20.475
How'd you know this
place would be empty?

12:20.477 --> 12:22.611
The drug dealer, Raul Mendez,

12:22.613 --> 12:24.045
he owns this place.

12:24.047 --> 12:26.381
Went away on an extended vacation.

12:28.385 --> 12:30.018
All right, inside the door

12:30.020 --> 12:32.354
on the left hand side there's a button.

12:32.356 --> 12:34.489
Just push it.

12:34.491 --> 12:39.361
Where's the money, Donnie?

12:40.864 --> 12:41.997
Hello?

12:41.999 --> 12:44.099
Hey, it's me. You all good?

12:44.101 --> 12:45.767
Yeah, crick in my neck, but yeah.

12:45.769 --> 12:47.269
Yeah, we're healthy and whole.

12:47.271 --> 12:48.937
Any late night callers?

12:48.939 --> 12:50.071
Yeah, no thanks

12:50.073 --> 12:51.907
to our third-shift lookout.

12:51.909 --> 12:53.241
How's Tess?

12:53.243 --> 12:55.444
She's sleeping, uh, finally.

12:55.446 --> 12:57.913
We changed the dressing
like the doc said.

12:57.915 --> 12:59.714
She's okay, but I'd love to tell her

12:59.716 --> 13:01.316
this slumber party ain't permanent.

13:01.318 --> 13:03.952
Loman didn't talk.

13:03.954 --> 13:06.455
The Feds rode him hard for an ID,

13:06.457 --> 13:08.156
which means they need one.

13:08.158 --> 13:09.691
Get to the precinct.

13:09.693 --> 13:12.027
It's important that
everybody show their face.

13:12.029 --> 13:13.562
Where is he?

13:13.564 --> 13:15.564
Where you been all night, Woz?

13:15.566 --> 13:17.232
Cleaning house.

13:18.836 --> 13:20.502
Oh.

13:21.805 --> 13:23.371
Hey, hey.

13:23.373 --> 13:24.739
How you feeling?

13:24.741 --> 13:27.409
Like I just got shot

13:27.411 --> 13:29.811
and some amateur doctor pulled it out.

13:29.813 --> 13:31.713
My bedside manner is legendary.

13:34.618 --> 13:37.686
Take me home.

13:37.688 --> 13:39.721
I want to see Joe and the kids.

13:39.723 --> 13:42.457
All right.

13:43.694 --> 13:44.759
Miguel, open the door!

13:44.761 --> 13:45.927
Hey!

13:45.929 --> 13:47.362
I said I was coming with you.

13:47.364 --> 13:49.364
You shouldn't be here. I won't
be following procedure.

13:49.366 --> 13:50.765
I'll risk it.

13:50.767 --> 13:52.334
Don't say I didn't warn you.

13:52.336 --> 13:54.402
Miguel!

13:54.404 --> 13:55.470
Where is she?

13:55.472 --> 13:58.306
Cristina? I'm here, baby.

13:58.308 --> 13:59.341
She didn't call you?

13:59.343 --> 14:00.609
You think I'm playing, Miguel?

14:00.611 --> 14:01.943
Where's her daughter?

14:01.945 --> 14:03.545
Do you work on that Batman voice?

14:03.547 --> 14:05.013
Yeah, I punch like him too.

14:05.015 --> 14:07.249
You know, the two of you
are a violent couple.

14:07.251 --> 14:09.150
Makes me concerned for
Cristina's welfare.

14:09.152 --> 14:10.752
Yeah, you don't get to
be concerned, all right?

14:10.754 --> 14:12.220
You're nothing to her.

14:12.222 --> 14:14.356
That's not what she said to me
when she called last night.

14:14.358 --> 14:15.524
You're a liar.

14:15.526 --> 14:16.658
She asked me to pick her up.

14:16.660 --> 14:18.093
She doesn't have your number!

14:18.095 --> 14:20.195
She didn't tell you?

14:21.398 --> 14:25.000
Oh, we had a nice
dinner the other night.

14:25.002 --> 14:26.368
Harlee, that's enough.

14:26.370 --> 14:27.402
No, it's not nearly enough.

14:27.404 --> 14:28.904
- You need to go now!
- No.

14:28.906 --> 14:30.639
This is family business
and you're not family.

14:30.641 --> 14:32.073
I'm an assistant district attorney.

14:32.075 --> 14:33.441
Fine, then stay and watch. I don't care.

14:33.443 --> 14:35.677
You have till three to tell
me where my daughter is.

14:35.679 --> 14:36.745
Harlee, put the gun down!

14:36.747 --> 14:38.446
So this is the new you.

14:38.448 --> 14:39.548
Tough girl.

14:39.550 --> 14:40.582
One.

14:40.584 --> 14:41.950
God, are you trying to turn me on?

14:41.952 --> 14:43.084
- Two.
- I can't protect you

14:43.086 --> 14:44.185
- on this, Harlee.
- Good to know.

14:44.187 --> 14:46.488
Three.

14:49.493 --> 14:52.227
I didn't take her.

14:52.229 --> 14:53.495
Like I said, she called.

14:53.497 --> 14:55.463
She was mad at you, so I picked her up.

14:55.465 --> 14:58.800
She's... with my mom at the store.

15:02.773 --> 15:04.806
You better hope so.

15:07.044 --> 15:08.577
What now?

15:08.579 --> 15:09.978
We hit the switch.

15:09.980 --> 15:12.213
Let him burn.

15:12.215 --> 15:14.082
Anything you want to say?

15:16.119 --> 15:17.586
He was a bad cop who did bad things

15:17.588 --> 15:18.687
and something bad happened to him.

15:18.689 --> 15:19.654
Amen.

15:19.656 --> 15:20.956
Amen.

15:20.958 --> 15:22.891
Why don't you get the car?

15:30.701 --> 15:33.101
I cared for you, Donnie,

15:33.103 --> 15:36.304
and you played me.

15:42.479 --> 15:44.346
I'll see you in hell.

15:53.432 --> 15:54.866
Harlee, do you know
what's really messed up

15:54.868 --> 15:56.668
about this whole thing?

15:56.670 --> 15:59.371
I'm still dreaming about you.

15:59.373 --> 16:02.774
Do you ever dream about me?

16:02.776 --> 16:06.244
Cristina... get in front.

16:06.246 --> 16:08.513
Why is he in the back of the car?

16:08.515 --> 16:09.647
It's okay, sweetheart.

16:09.649 --> 16:10.749
It's just a misunderstanding.

16:10.751 --> 16:12.183
- Get in the car.
- Why?

16:12.402 --> 16:14.402
'Cause you don't want me to
spend time with my family?

16:14.427 --> 16:15.827
Cristina, today's not the day.

16:15.829 --> 16:17.428
Harlee, please, we were just
getting to know each other.

16:17.430 --> 16:18.663
I don't want her to know you.

16:18.665 --> 16:19.931
- Mom!
- Get in the car!

16:19.933 --> 16:20.898
Not until you let him out.

16:20.900 --> 16:22.000
He didn't do anything wrong.

16:22.002 --> 16:22.967
He took you from Linda's.

16:22.969 --> 16:23.968
I asked him to.

16:23.970 --> 16:25.136
Why would you do that?

16:25.138 --> 16:27.271
Because you lied to me.

16:27.273 --> 16:29.307
You swore to me

16:29.309 --> 16:30.742
he wasn't my father, and he is.

16:32.245 --> 16:33.578
I have a grandmother.

16:33.580 --> 16:37.315
I have aunts and uncles and cousins.

16:42.989 --> 16:44.889
Take the handcuffs off him, Mom.

16:44.891 --> 16:47.759
Mama Bear, she's a grizzly.

16:47.761 --> 16:50.261
- Turn around and shut up.
- Ow.

16:50.263 --> 16:51.629
Up front now.

16:57.904 --> 17:00.705
I'm gonna give you the
money I promised you,

17:00.707 --> 17:02.440
and you're gonna disappear.

17:08.982 --> 17:11.382
Forget something?

17:11.384 --> 17:13.284
Stay at your mom's.

17:13.286 --> 17:15.252
I'll find you there.

17:29.836 --> 17:33.571
Nice day.

17:33.573 --> 17:34.706
You Wozniak?

17:34.708 --> 17:37.241
Where's Linklater?

17:37.243 --> 17:38.376
Do you have his money?

17:38.378 --> 17:40.378
No...

17:40.380 --> 17:43.314
and if I did, I wouldn't
be giving it to Mr. Mom.

17:43.316 --> 17:45.483
You won't have to.

17:45.485 --> 17:48.219
An overseas bank account number.

17:48.221 --> 17:50.388
Clean the cash and deposit it.

17:50.390 --> 17:52.190
There's no way.

17:52.192 --> 17:53.825
If he wants it, he's gonna have to

17:53.827 --> 17:56.227
come and get it face-to-face.

17:56.229 --> 17:57.695
It's not possible.

17:57.697 --> 17:59.831
Neither is swallowing your own balls

17:59.833 --> 18:01.632
but your son's about to watch you do it.

18:01.634 --> 18:05.336
Mr. Linklater isn't who you think he is.

18:05.338 --> 18:07.538
Linklater isn't even his name,

18:07.540 --> 18:09.941
and he's already out of the country.

18:09.943 --> 18:11.242
Oh, I doubt that.

18:11.244 --> 18:13.311
Not with this much money
in play, he's not.

18:13.313 --> 18:15.313
If the money isn't deposited in a week,

18:15.315 --> 18:17.181
he'll send his incriminating
photos to the Feds.

18:19.085 --> 18:20.551
You take the fall for the kidnapping,

18:20.553 --> 18:25.423
the murder, the heist, everything.

18:25.425 --> 18:27.558
Have a nice day.

18:27.560 --> 18:30.895
Come on, bud.

18:34.768 --> 18:37.468
There was a situation I needed to handle

18:37.470 --> 18:39.103
but I'm on track to deliver.

18:39.105 --> 18:41.272
Harlee, you know that
when the clock runs out

18:41.274 --> 18:42.573
there's a boom.

18:42.575 --> 18:43.574
I was right.

18:43.576 --> 18:45.009
Donnie had the money.

18:45.011 --> 18:46.144
You've seen it?

18:46.146 --> 18:47.445
No,

18:47.447 --> 18:48.446
but Wozniak confronted him

18:48.448 --> 18:49.413
and they're meeting up later.

18:49.415 --> 18:50.414
I don't know where.

18:50.416 --> 18:51.949
Harlee, this is Gail Baker.

18:51.951 --> 18:54.552
You need to put our
Linklater at that location.

18:54.554 --> 18:55.520
I know.

18:55.522 --> 18:56.954
I'm working on it.

18:56.956 --> 18:58.689
Wozniak has a contact number,

18:58.691 --> 19:00.258
but before any of that happens,

19:00.260 --> 19:01.392
I need you to make it official.

19:01.394 --> 19:03.261
My crew does not get prosecuted.

19:03.263 --> 19:05.062
You have my word, Harlee.

19:05.064 --> 19:06.597
Yeah, I've heard that before.

19:06.599 --> 19:08.499
I need it emailed to me.

19:11.237 --> 19:12.737
Just get me my bust.

19:15.241 --> 19:17.608
One way or the other,
we get what we need.

19:17.610 --> 19:20.845
Even so, we lost a hostage
under our surveillance.

19:20.847 --> 19:23.114
Supervisor Finnegan is
brandishing his ax.

19:23.116 --> 19:24.749
You decide where he swings it?

19:24.751 --> 19:26.551
Not at me, I know that.

19:35.762 --> 19:36.894
How's Cristina?

19:36.896 --> 19:37.895
Angry.

19:37.897 --> 19:40.565
Rebellious. Brainwashed.

19:40.567 --> 19:41.532
I missed Linda's call

19:41.534 --> 19:43.634
and by the time I got the message

19:43.636 --> 19:45.036
I was hung up on a problem.

19:45.038 --> 19:47.672
Yeah, well, brace
yourself for a new one.

19:47.674 --> 19:49.674
I need to talk to you in person.

19:49.676 --> 19:51.976
All right, well, give me a couple hours.

19:51.978 --> 19:55.980
No, now.

19:55.982 --> 19:57.181
I need you now.

19:59.385 --> 20:01.118
It's a little morbid, isn't it?

20:01.120 --> 20:02.486
Well, I like it here.

20:02.488 --> 20:03.821
Everybody's blind.

20:03.823 --> 20:05.122
Nobody's talking.

20:05.124 --> 20:08.059
Makes you wonder what they
would say if they could.

20:11.631 --> 20:15.366
Well, I have my money on "I love you...

20:17.303 --> 20:20.037
and I'm sorry."

20:21.774 --> 20:23.808
Is this a preamble, Harlee?

20:23.810 --> 20:26.377
No.

20:26.379 --> 20:28.579
It's a confession.

20:30.683 --> 20:33.851
You know that agent you
showed me a picture of?

20:33.853 --> 20:36.153
The one you said was
sleeping with a prostitute

20:36.155 --> 20:37.288
- who looked like me?
- Stahl.

20:39.559 --> 20:41.459
He picked me up with Gail Baker.

20:41.461 --> 20:43.327
Threatened to put me in jail,

20:43.329 --> 20:44.862
used Cristina as influence.

20:44.864 --> 20:47.431
I mean, everything that you said

20:47.433 --> 20:49.000
that they were gonna do, they did.

20:49.002 --> 20:50.501
When?

20:50.503 --> 20:51.936
How long ago?

20:54.641 --> 20:56.540
Last night.

21:00.113 --> 21:02.847
Your uncle Woz sees
your shoes on his desk,

21:02.849 --> 21:04.649
you might be walking on your ankles.

21:04.651 --> 21:06.751
My mom has you babysitting me?

21:06.753 --> 21:08.853
Our holding cell's empty if you prefer.

21:08.855 --> 21:12.089
Wow, freedom to make a decision.

21:12.091 --> 21:15.493
Don't tell my mom.

21:15.495 --> 21:16.894
Parents can be frustrating, huh?

21:16.896 --> 21:18.663
Yeah, they can also be liars.

21:18.665 --> 21:19.797
Well, here's what I know.

21:19.799 --> 21:22.500
Being a cop is a hard job,

21:22.502 --> 21:24.802
and being a single parent is a hard job,

21:24.804 --> 21:27.571
so that means your mom
has two hard jobs,

21:27.573 --> 21:29.540
and the fact that the
bad guys are in jail

21:29.542 --> 21:32.043
and you're sitting here,
smart, independent,

21:32.045 --> 21:34.345
willful and educated,
means your mom is doing

21:34.347 --> 21:35.913
both jobs pretty well.

21:35.915 --> 21:38.883
You know...

21:40.186 --> 21:44.255
It's not even the lying that bothers me.

21:44.257 --> 21:46.958
It's the fact that it
seems so easy for her.

21:46.960 --> 21:50.061
Woz, the FBI found the heist money.

21:50.063 --> 21:52.029
All 12 million.

21:52.031 --> 21:53.831
A security camera

21:53.833 --> 21:55.633
picked up our accident
and they tracked down

21:55.635 --> 21:57.301
the guy who hit us... it wasn't Donnie.

21:58.371 --> 22:00.004
Who?

22:00.006 --> 22:01.772
Who... who do they think did it?

22:01.774 --> 22:05.142
Stahl didn't give details,

22:05.144 --> 22:06.577
but he gave me the money...

22:08.147 --> 22:09.814
and he told me to put it back in play.

22:09.816 --> 22:10.982
Where is it?

22:10.984 --> 22:13.351
Well, they think it's at your boat,

22:13.353 --> 22:15.119
but I double bagged and moved it.

22:15.121 --> 22:17.355
It's in an abandoned
building in Maspeth.

22:17.357 --> 22:19.390
326 Bradley.

22:19.392 --> 22:21.459
I'm paying a C.I. to sit on it.

22:24.564 --> 22:27.031
You were never very good
at following orders.

22:27.033 --> 22:30.401
I'm supposed to tell you that
I tracked down the money

22:30.403 --> 22:31.969
and convince you to set up a meet

22:31.971 --> 22:33.771
with Linklater and
Donnie to split it up.

22:33.773 --> 22:35.206
And that's where the Feds would have

22:35.208 --> 22:36.841
all the players in one place.

22:36.843 --> 22:38.809
All the players but one.

22:38.811 --> 22:40.277
You know I have to deliver

22:40.279 --> 22:42.446
on a piece of this,

22:42.448 --> 22:45.583
but I won't let that piece be you.

22:45.585 --> 22:48.452
I'm the only piece that's
left on the board.

22:48.454 --> 22:50.021
I need you to contact Linklater

22:50.023 --> 22:51.956
and then I need you to
convince Donnie to show up.

22:51.958 --> 22:53.858
You don't understand what I'm saying.

22:53.860 --> 22:55.292
No, I think that they'll settle

22:55.294 --> 22:56.827
for Linklater and Donnie.

22:56.829 --> 22:57.795
They're bigger fish.

22:57.797 --> 22:58.763
No offense.

22:58.765 --> 23:00.798
It's a great plan.

23:00.800 --> 23:02.733
It's a very generous plan.

23:02.735 --> 23:07.671
It might've even worked...

23:07.673 --> 23:09.707
- but Donnie's dead.
- What?

23:09.709 --> 23:13.377
Loman killed him in self-defense.

23:13.379 --> 23:16.881
Linklater left the country,

23:16.883 --> 23:18.582
which means the only person

23:18.584 --> 23:21.318
you got left to sell out...

23:21.320 --> 23:22.520
is me.

23:40.506 --> 23:42.773
Look, I can stall the FBI.

23:42.775 --> 23:44.708
Okay, you could tell them
that you're still trying

23:44.710 --> 23:45.910
to set up the meet.

23:45.912 --> 23:47.311
It won't buy us a lot of time,

23:47.313 --> 23:49.280
but it'll be enough for
you to go get some cash,

23:49.282 --> 23:50.915
get Linda, and go.

23:50.917 --> 23:54.952
Why don't you come with us?

23:54.954 --> 23:56.754
'Cause this Stahl guy
has a thing for me.

23:56.756 --> 23:58.923
I think I have a better chance
of buying time in person.

24:00.293 --> 24:02.493
Cristina and I will meet you later.

24:02.495 --> 24:04.528
You promise?

24:07.100 --> 24:09.133
Would I lie to you?

24:16.186 --> 24:18.554
It's cash I took from
evidence for a sting.

24:18.556 --> 24:21.791
Nearly had a heart attack
when I realized it was gone.

24:22.170 --> 24:23.918
- Show me the paperwork.
- Excuse me?

24:23.943 --> 24:25.143
If this is cash from evidence

24:25.145 --> 24:26.311
there's a paper trail, right?

24:26.313 --> 24:27.979
Approvals?

24:27.981 --> 24:29.714
Why do I feel like I'm
on the stand right now?

24:29.716 --> 24:32.817
Because I'm a prosecutor
and I don't believe you.

24:32.819 --> 24:34.252
Well, I don't need you to believe me.

24:34.254 --> 24:35.920
Okay, because it's
none of your business.

24:35.922 --> 24:38.189
Cops with mysterious bags
of cash in my apartment,

24:38.191 --> 24:39.957
very much my business.

24:39.959 --> 24:43.628
What's going on, Harlee? Huh?

24:43.630 --> 24:45.296
This morning you put a
gun in Miguel's face,

24:45.298 --> 24:49.133
and now you're lying to me
about $200,000 in cash.

24:51.338 --> 24:52.503
It's my money.

24:52.505 --> 24:55.106
All right, everything I've saved.

24:55.108 --> 24:57.542
I'm paying Miguel to leave us alone.

24:57.544 --> 24:58.843
You're smarter than that.

24:58.845 --> 25:00.278
Well, I'm not asking your permission.

25:00.280 --> 25:02.146
What makes you think he won't
just take it and stay?

25:02.148 --> 25:05.950
Because if he stays, I'll hurt him.

25:08.321 --> 25:10.288
You did frame him the first time.

25:12.559 --> 25:14.992
I told you before,

25:14.994 --> 25:17.929
I'm a bad person.

25:17.931 --> 25:19.964
You chose not to believe it,

25:19.966 --> 25:21.833
and I chose to let it happen

25:21.835 --> 25:24.102
because I love the way
that you look at me.

25:24.104 --> 25:26.771
I'm just trying to wrap
my head around all this.

25:29.676 --> 25:32.243
Go back to your blonde
fiancée in Greenwich.

25:34.247 --> 25:37.248
There's too much street in me for you.

25:42.722 --> 25:44.389
Miguel's expecting this.

25:44.391 --> 25:45.690
It's not a gift.

25:45.692 --> 25:47.024
It's a payment.

25:47.026 --> 25:48.626
He knows what I'm buying.

25:48.628 --> 25:49.727
Harlee?

25:49.729 --> 25:51.429
Harlee, please.

25:51.431 --> 25:53.731
For ten years I left you alone,

25:53.733 --> 25:55.833
but now that I've met her,

25:55.835 --> 26:00.104
I... I want to know my granddaughter.

26:00.106 --> 26:02.707
You watched your son
repeatedly break my face,

26:02.709 --> 26:05.643
and didn't lift a finger to help.

26:05.645 --> 26:09.614
Why would I think it'd be
any different for Cristina?

26:09.616 --> 26:12.316
A mother will do terrible
things to protect her child.

26:12.318 --> 26:14.051
Surely you understand that now.

26:14.053 --> 26:15.720
You didn't protect him, Lorena.

26:15.722 --> 26:17.088
You enabled him.

26:19.859 --> 26:22.860
Stay away from Cristina.

26:29.002 --> 26:30.334
Lieutenant Wozniak,

26:30.336 --> 26:32.170
Harlee said you'd be stopping by.

26:32.172 --> 26:35.006
Welcome to Caddie's first
bank of the basement.

26:35.008 --> 26:38.009
I'm here to make a withdrawal.

26:40.280 --> 26:42.447
We're about to let slip
the dogs of war, Harlee.

26:42.449 --> 26:43.981
All we need is an address.

26:43.983 --> 26:45.850
I don't have what I promised.

26:47.086 --> 26:48.319
You telling me you failed?

26:48.321 --> 26:49.821
I'm telling you that I'm submitting.

26:49.823 --> 26:51.322
That's what you always
wanted anyway, right?

26:51.324 --> 26:52.690
Well, you win.

26:52.692 --> 26:54.158
- Define submit.
- Donnie's gone.

26:54.160 --> 26:55.460
I don't know where.

26:55.462 --> 26:56.627
Linklater's out of the country

26:56.629 --> 26:58.229
and Wozniak's not returning my calls.

26:58.231 --> 26:59.497
So you don't have anything?

26:59.499 --> 27:01.432
That's not exactly true.

27:03.536 --> 27:05.436
I have your money...

27:07.607 --> 27:09.273
And I'm willing to
trade my immunity deal

27:09.275 --> 27:10.808
for my crew's freedom.

27:12.645 --> 27:13.778
If I say no?

27:13.780 --> 27:17.448
Then I burn the money
and you get nothing.

27:17.450 --> 27:20.084
12 million dollars. Why not run?

27:20.086 --> 27:23.087
I thought about it.

27:23.089 --> 27:24.388
Then I thought about the message

27:24.390 --> 27:25.823
that I'd be sending to my daughter.

27:28.528 --> 27:29.961
How's she ever gonna take responsibility

27:29.963 --> 27:33.331
for her mistakes if I don't?

27:33.333 --> 27:36.100
Look, I'll text you an
address for the cash.

27:36.102 --> 27:37.935
You can pick it up and arrest me there.

27:37.937 --> 27:39.203
Harlee?

27:39.205 --> 27:40.204
Got to go, Stahl.

27:40.206 --> 27:41.439
I got to say good-bye to somebody.

27:41.441 --> 27:44.108
Harlee?

27:45.812 --> 27:48.880
We got to have all that
lined up within 30 minutes.

27:48.882 --> 27:49.947
Can we add two more agents to that?

27:49.949 --> 27:50.982
Why don't you pull it up,

27:50.984 --> 27:52.049
meet me in the command center, okay?

27:52.051 --> 27:53.417
- Yes, sir.
- Hey.

27:53.419 --> 27:54.986
I'll meet you guys in a minute.

27:54.988 --> 27:56.387
Baker needed to talk to me.

27:56.389 --> 27:59.257
Mmm, well, I think it's
more than just a talk.

28:00.627 --> 28:02.994
You got a good heart, Agent Chen,

28:02.996 --> 28:04.395
but remorse can be dangerous.

28:04.397 --> 28:06.597
It can lead to unwise decisions.

28:06.599 --> 28:08.566
Did you tell her about last night?

28:08.568 --> 28:10.735
No, no.

28:10.737 --> 28:12.370
I'm a gentleman,

28:12.372 --> 28:14.272
but it is my duty to
report unstable behavior.

28:14.274 --> 28:15.940
Unstable?

28:15.942 --> 28:18.175
Your grief is a problem, Agent Chen.

28:18.177 --> 28:19.143
I mean, you fell apart,

28:19.145 --> 28:20.711
and a man walked into that warehouse

28:20.713 --> 28:22.914
you were surveilling and
butchered a hostage.

28:22.916 --> 28:24.181
I had no line of sight.

28:24.183 --> 28:25.316
You know that.

28:25.318 --> 28:26.317
I expressed concerns

28:26.319 --> 28:27.919
about the risk of keeping him in play.

28:27.921 --> 28:29.186
Failure is an orphan, isn't it?

28:29.188 --> 28:31.055
You botched this operation,

28:31.057 --> 28:32.256
Agent Stahl, not me.

28:32.258 --> 28:33.457
Wild accusations like that

28:33.459 --> 28:35.059
are just gonna sound desperate in there.

28:35.061 --> 28:37.862
You tell me this case is gonna make me,

28:37.864 --> 28:39.597
and then you have sex
with me already knowing

28:39.599 --> 28:40.731
I'd be your fall guy.

28:40.733 --> 28:43.200
Look, deep down you know this is best.

28:44.837 --> 28:46.604
You're smart, Molly,

28:46.606 --> 28:49.240
but let's face it, you don't
have a killer instinct.

28:49.242 --> 28:51.142
Well, if that's what
separates me from you,

28:51.144 --> 28:54.045
thank God I don't.

28:54.047 --> 28:55.313
Your law enforcement experience

28:55.315 --> 28:58.316
will be invaluable in
the private sector.

29:00.353 --> 29:01.385
Molly.

29:07.427 --> 29:08.559
I know what you're thinking.

29:08.561 --> 29:10.728
I can see it on your face.

29:10.730 --> 29:14.332
Guess I haven't perfected
your technique yet.

29:14.334 --> 29:15.566
Can you give me another shot?

29:17.437 --> 29:19.503
Promise I'll tell the truth.

29:21.841 --> 29:23.741
Well, I haven't got a chance

29:23.743 --> 29:27.545
to be emancipated yet, so go for it.

29:27.547 --> 29:30.915
Okay.

29:30.917 --> 29:33.651
Miguel did beat me...

29:33.653 --> 29:36.988
for two years.

29:36.990 --> 29:41.058
When he pushed me down those
stairs, he almost killed me.

29:41.060 --> 29:44.895
He almost killed both of us...

29:44.897 --> 29:48.099
and I swore right then

29:48.101 --> 29:50.001
that I would never let him do to you

29:50.003 --> 29:51.135
what he did to me.

29:51.137 --> 29:53.738
It just doesn't make sense.

29:53.740 --> 29:55.239
Why would he want to hurt me now?

29:55.241 --> 29:56.574
He's been nothing but nice to me.

29:56.576 --> 30:00.578
You can't trust an abuser,
Cristina, all right?

30:00.580 --> 30:02.747
They take everything that
you hate about yourself

30:02.749 --> 30:04.382
and they use it to control you.

30:04.384 --> 30:06.384
But...

30:06.386 --> 30:07.785
He said that these years,

30:07.787 --> 30:10.388
they gave him a chance
to become a better man,

30:10.390 --> 30:12.056
someone worthy of being my dad.

30:12.058 --> 30:13.924
And this facade that he's showing you

30:13.926 --> 30:15.693
is so scary to me,

30:15.695 --> 30:17.428
because I know what it masks.

30:17.430 --> 30:19.897
Miguel isn't impulsive.

30:19.899 --> 30:21.666
Miguel isn't misunderstood.

30:21.668 --> 30:23.701
He is a calculating,

30:23.703 --> 30:26.170
unforgiving monster.

30:30.043 --> 30:33.010
I know that I lied to you

30:33.012 --> 30:35.413
about him being your father,

30:35.415 --> 30:37.882
and that was wrong,

30:37.884 --> 30:40.551
but I was just trying to keep you safe.

30:45.291 --> 30:47.658
Lying isn't the only
mistake that I've made.

30:51.531 --> 30:56.233
I've let you down...

30:56.235 --> 31:00.337
in ways that you know and
in ways that you don't,

31:00.339 --> 31:04.075
and I'm gonna have to
pay for that, okay?

31:04.077 --> 31:05.509
But it's important

31:05.511 --> 31:08.713
that you know that I believe
that I was doing right by you.

31:08.715 --> 31:12.383
Final call for ticketed passengers...

31:12.385 --> 31:14.151
Okay.

31:14.153 --> 31:15.720
Please make your way
to the boarding area

31:15.722 --> 31:17.588
for immediate boarding.

31:20.526 --> 31:22.059
What's Aunt Gemma doing here?

31:22.061 --> 31:24.028
You're gonna be staying
with her for a while.

31:24.030 --> 31:25.663
What?

31:25.665 --> 31:26.797
In Jersey City?

31:26.799 --> 31:27.932
Mom, what about school?

31:27.934 --> 31:29.567
What about my friends?

31:29.569 --> 31:31.502
It's not gonna be easy.

31:31.504 --> 31:34.939
You're strong, okay?

31:34.941 --> 31:36.440
And with that big heart of yours...

31:36.442 --> 31:37.575
Mom, where are you going?

31:40.813 --> 31:43.147
Mom, you can't leave me.

31:43.149 --> 31:44.582
Cristina, please.

31:44.584 --> 31:47.351
Mom, we're a team.

31:47.353 --> 31:50.020
I need you.

32:02.764 --> 32:04.831
Mom!

32:13.092 --> 32:15.727
Hey.

32:16.216 --> 32:17.248
You good?

32:17.250 --> 32:19.081
I got to admit,

32:19.339 --> 32:21.339
we had you pegged wrong.

32:21.341 --> 32:22.874
Yeah, you...

32:22.876 --> 32:24.909
you really saved our asses.

32:26.947 --> 32:28.346
You think we'll get away with this?

32:28.348 --> 32:30.014
I don't know. Maybe.

32:30.016 --> 32:32.884
The important thing is
you just said, "We."

32:32.886 --> 32:35.253
Hear we got some

32:35.255 --> 32:38.890
bangers running recruitment out
of the Y basketball courts.

32:38.892 --> 32:40.825
You want to go catch
some bad guys or what?

32:44.531 --> 32:46.264
Sure,

32:46.266 --> 32:47.632
but I'm driving.

32:47.634 --> 32:50.735
I'm tired of riding bitch.

32:54.874 --> 32:56.341
Well, hi there, Harlee.

32:56.343 --> 32:58.676
I'm not sending the address to the money

32:58.678 --> 33:00.845
until I see the immunity
contracts in my email.

33:00.847 --> 33:02.246
Say it again.

33:02.248 --> 33:03.247
Say what again?

33:03.249 --> 33:05.216
Say that I win.

33:05.218 --> 33:06.551
You submit.

33:06.553 --> 33:07.685
I'll do it, Stahl.

33:07.687 --> 33:08.753
I'll burn the money.

33:08.755 --> 33:10.655
No, you won't.

33:10.657 --> 33:13.691
This time it's you who's
been outplayed, Harlee.

33:32.278 --> 33:33.745
Wozniak took everything.

33:33.747 --> 33:36.547
Left you that.

33:36.549 --> 33:39.584
Said to tell you the plans have changed.

33:44.924 --> 33:47.325
Don't leave that bag in a cab.

33:47.327 --> 33:49.794
That's Cristina's college fund.

33:49.796 --> 33:52.096
What are you doing?

33:52.098 --> 33:54.866
What I would've done if you came to me.

33:54.868 --> 33:56.300
Taking the bullet.

33:56.302 --> 33:57.835
You need to turn around.

33:57.837 --> 33:59.337
Go home,

33:59.339 --> 34:00.738
give our girl a kiss.

34:00.740 --> 34:02.373
You don't understand.

34:02.375 --> 34:05.410
All right, I told you I was
running but I cut a deal.

34:06.446 --> 34:08.045
I'm turning myself in for the crew.

34:09.349 --> 34:12.216
I cut the same deal, Harlee.

34:12.217 --> 34:15.420
I saw Stahl looking lonely at a diner

34:15.422 --> 34:17.388
last night.

34:17.389 --> 34:19.690
Guess I'm a bigger fish, Harlee.

34:19.693 --> 34:22.226
No offense.

34:22.228 --> 34:23.661
Woz, you can't do this.

34:23.663 --> 34:25.429
I'm at peace with this.

34:25.431 --> 34:28.266
I need peace.

34:28.268 --> 34:30.967
No, you don't know the truth, okay?

34:30.969 --> 34:33.036
I lied to you.

34:33.039 --> 34:35.639
The Feds didn't pick me up last night.

34:35.641 --> 34:38.643
It was me all along.

34:40.480 --> 34:42.013
I was the mole.

34:44.818 --> 34:46.250
I know, Harlee.

34:48.521 --> 34:50.554
I know.

34:50.556 --> 34:53.658
You said the Feds found
the money yesterday

34:53.659 --> 34:56.393
and gave it to you.

34:56.396 --> 34:58.629
I talked to Stahl last night.

35:00.333 --> 35:03.334
The Feds still wanted the money.

35:07.107 --> 35:09.774
Give me the truth, Harlee.

35:09.776 --> 35:13.778
No more secrets.

35:13.780 --> 35:16.347
I couldn't let everyone go down.

35:19.052 --> 35:23.121
I stole the money to keep us whole.

35:23.123 --> 35:27.692
Everything that you would
do to protect Cristina...

35:27.694 --> 35:30.461
that's you for me.

35:30.463 --> 35:33.231
I don't want to lose another daughter.

35:39.139 --> 35:40.571
I forgive you.

35:45.478 --> 35:48.012
No.

35:48.014 --> 35:49.547
There has to be some way.

35:54.387 --> 35:55.720
Well, unless you have

35:55.722 --> 35:58.222
something on this Fed that
I don't know about...

36:00.293 --> 36:02.293
I think we've reached
the end of the road.

36:05.665 --> 36:07.832
Wait, Woz.

36:07.834 --> 36:10.768
Woz, wait.

36:23.249 --> 36:25.216
Lieutenant Wozniak, on the ground!

36:25.218 --> 36:27.585
Hands where we can see them!

36:27.587 --> 36:29.620
Lieutenant, on the ground now!

36:37.921 --> 36:40.656
Yeah, I'm still sorting
a few things out,

36:40.994 --> 36:43.762
but I may be able to pick
Cristina up in the morning.

36:43.764 --> 36:46.732
Gemma, thanks for doing this.

36:48.102 --> 36:50.068
Okay, bye.

37:34.782 --> 37:38.483
So stunning.

37:38.485 --> 37:41.052
And that's not even the most
irresistible part of you.

37:41.054 --> 37:42.921
We had an agreement, Miguel.

37:42.923 --> 37:45.757
I gave you 200,000 reasons to stay away.

37:45.759 --> 37:48.260
Did you?

37:48.262 --> 37:50.529
Must've slipped my mind.

37:53.033 --> 37:55.867
That handgun of yours is a barrier

37:55.869 --> 37:57.836
to a civilized conversation,

37:57.838 --> 38:01.773
to reconciliation.

38:01.775 --> 38:03.408
What, now we're gonna add theft

38:03.410 --> 38:05.143
and breaking and entering
to your rap sheet?

38:05.145 --> 38:08.246
I was invited, Officer.

38:08.248 --> 38:09.414
I'm family.

38:09.416 --> 38:11.650
In fact...

38:14.955 --> 38:16.021
Got my own key.

38:16.023 --> 38:18.123
Where did you get that?

38:18.125 --> 38:20.992
Cristina and I have been growing closer.

38:20.994 --> 38:23.361
We're making up for lost time.

38:23.363 --> 38:25.497
I told you to stay away from her.

38:25.499 --> 38:26.631
She's almost a grown woman.

38:26.633 --> 38:28.366
She can decide for herself,

38:28.368 --> 38:30.101
and frankly, she doesn't
trust you anymore.

38:30.103 --> 38:32.337
I'm giving you a chance, Miguel.

38:32.339 --> 38:34.573
All right, put down my gun.

38:34.575 --> 38:37.442
Get out of my house, and take the money.

38:37.444 --> 38:39.110
Okay, it's a new life.

38:40.940 --> 38:44.275
I'm taking the money,

38:44.277 --> 38:45.543
but I don't want a new life.

38:45.545 --> 38:46.610
I want my old one.

38:48.114 --> 38:50.181
And I'm starting by visiting Aunt Gemma.

38:50.183 --> 38:51.916
No.

38:51.918 --> 38:53.284
She wouldn't have told you that.

38:53.286 --> 38:56.821
Cristina and I have our
own little secrets too.

38:56.823 --> 38:59.156
Ten years I have rotted
in that prison cell.

38:59.158 --> 39:01.592
Do you really think you
can pay me to slink away

39:01.594 --> 39:02.960
and wash away your
sins with blood money?

39:02.962 --> 39:03.928
I won't let you...

39:03.930 --> 39:06.697
Ten years!

39:06.699 --> 39:09.333
Ten years you have dictated
how I live my life.

39:09.335 --> 39:10.968
Now I dictate how to live yours.

39:10.971 --> 39:13.171
No.

39:15.341 --> 39:17.808
I'm not that same silly little
girl you used to control...

39:17.810 --> 39:20.945
Unh! Ohh!

39:20.947 --> 39:22.179
Oh, that's right.

39:22.181 --> 39:23.314
You're a badass now, huh?

39:23.316 --> 39:25.683
A badass who got mixed up
with the wrong people.

39:25.685 --> 39:28.385
Caught between the FBI and
some crooked friends,

39:28.387 --> 39:30.020
and now you're all alone.

39:30.022 --> 39:31.756
I don't know what you...
you think you know.

39:31.759 --> 39:33.658
Oh, come on.

39:33.659 --> 39:35.159
I know you.

39:35.161 --> 39:38.496
I'm the only one who really knows you.

39:38.498 --> 39:40.731
All sides of you.

39:40.734 --> 39:44.691
That caring,

39:44.801 --> 39:47.435
funny...

39:47.437 --> 39:49.737
beautiful woman you let people see.

39:51.374 --> 39:53.507
And the ruthless bitch you are.

39:54.871 --> 39:56.070
And I love both of them.

39:56.073 --> 39:59.341
Hell, I can't get enough.

39:59.343 --> 40:02.177
No, please.

40:02.179 --> 40:06.048
We're bonded forever.

40:06.050 --> 40:10.619
We made that beautiful
creature together.

40:10.621 --> 40:15.324
Smart, eager...

40:15.326 --> 40:18.827
and feisty

40:18.829 --> 40:21.230
like her mother.

40:21.232 --> 40:24.934
Yet so fragile.

40:26.070 --> 40:27.970
You're gonna take everything I give you

40:27.972 --> 40:30.539
and you're gonna act like you like it,

40:30.541 --> 40:32.875
and you're gonna beg for more.

40:34.545 --> 40:37.513
And I'm not just gonna punish you.

40:42.386 --> 40:44.687
I'm gonna punish

40:44.689 --> 40:48.691
that precious little girl of yours.

40:53.864 --> 40:56.198
No need to cry.

40:56.200 --> 40:59.368
Daddy's home.
