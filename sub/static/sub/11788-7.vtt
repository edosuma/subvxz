SUBCONSCIOUS FEELINGS OF

41:34.020 --> 41:35.248
CONFLICT BUBBLING UP TO THE

41:35.260 --> 41:37.558
SURFACE AND CAUSING PAINFUL

41:37.560 --> 41:41.929
EXTERIOR DRAMA...ARE COMPLETELY

41:41.930 --> 41:44.194
EXPLAINABLE. AND THEY ARE NOT

41:44.200 --> 41:46.828
YOUR FAULT. WHEN YOU'VE BEEN

41:46.830 --> 41:48.092
CRUELLY DENIED THE TRUTH ABOUT

41:48.100 --> 41:50.637
THE VERY CORE OF YOUR IDENTITY,

41:50.640 --> 41:53.268
HOW COULD YOU NOT HAVE DOUBT?

41:53.270 --> 41:58.173
Matt: MY IDENTITY IS FINE, AVA.

41:58.180 --> 42:00.000
Ava: YOUR IDENTITY IS PREDICATED

42:00.010 --> 42:02.808
ON A LIE PERPETUATED BY YOUR

42:02.820 --> 42:07.689
MOTHER.

42:16.300 --> 42:17.289
Matt: WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY

42:17.300 --> 42:19.188
ROOM?

42:19.200 --> 42:20.360
Julia: SOMETHING I SHOULD HAVE

42:20.370 --> 42:22.258
DONE A LONG TIME AGO. FINDING

42:22.270 --> 42:24.192
OUT WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON

42:24.200 --> 42:25.303
IN MY SON'S LIFE.

42:25.310 --> 42:26.732
Matt: BY GOING THROUGH MY STUFF?

42:26.740 --> 42:27.729
Julia: FROM NOW ON, YOU'RE GOING

42:27.740 --> 42:29.037
TO HAVE TO EARN YOUR PRIVACY IN

42:29.040 --> 42:31.076
THIS HOUSE, MATT. THERE ARE

42:31.080 --> 42:32.001
GONNA BE NO MORE SECRETS BETWEEN

42:32.010 --> 42:32.806
US.

42:32.810 --> 42:33.777
Matt: THEN WHY DON'T WE START

42:33.780 --> 42:34.769
BY THE ONE YOU'RE KEEPING FROM

42:34.780 --> 42:35.917
ME?

42:35.920 --> 42:36.773
Julia: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING

42:36.780 --> 42:37.314
ABOUT?

42:37.320 --> 42:41.086
Matt: AVA TOLD ME. YOU'VE BEEN

42:41.090 --> 42:43.285
LYING TO ME MY WHOLE LIFE ABOUT

42:43.290 --> 42:44.086
WHO I AM.

42:44.090 --> 42:45.250
Julia: AVA IS A MANIPULATOR,

42:45.260 --> 42:46.784
MATT. YOU CANNOT BELIEVE

42:46.790 --> 42:48.326
ANYTHING SHE TELLS YOU.

42:48.330 --> 42:49.729
Matt: CHRISTIAN'S MY REAL DAD,

42:49.730 --> 42:54.064
ISN'T HE?

42:54.070 --> 42:59.303
Julia: WHAT? THAT'S CRAZY!

42:59.310 --> 43:00.709
Matt: I'VE SEEN THE WAY YOU TWO

43:00.710 --> 43:02.109
LOOK AT EACH OTHER, HOW CLOSE

43:02.110 --> 43:03.338
YOU ARE. HE EVEN SAID HE THINKS

43:03.340 --> 43:08.710
OF ME AS A SON. IF YOU WANT ME

43:08.720 --> 43:10.073
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU ABOUT MY

43:10.080 --> 43:15.211
LIFE, THEN TELL ME THE TRUTH.

43:15.220 --> 43:24.299
IS CHRISTIAN MY REAL FATHER?

43:24.300 --> 43:34.005
TELL ME!

43:34.010 --> 43:40.700
Julia: YES.

43:40.710 --> 43:43.178
I DIDN'T KNOW FOR THE LONGEST

43:43.180 --> 43:48.049
TIME. MATT, I'M SO SORRY. I

43:48.050 --> 43:49.756
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. WE'RE

43:49.760 --> 43:50.681
A FAMILY.

43:50.690 --> 43:52.055
Matt: NO, THIS WHOLE FAMILY IS

43:52.060 --> 43:53.425
BULLSHIT, AND YOU'RE THE REASON

43:53.430 --> 43:54.249
WHY.

43:54.260 --> 43:55.249
Julia: DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE

43:55.260 --> 43:56.989
THAT! I AM STILL YOUR MOTHER!

43:57.000 --> 43:58.399
Matt: YOU'RE NOT MY MOTHER.

43:58.400 --> 44:01.858
YOU'RE A WHORE. EVEN IF YOU DID

44:01.870 --> 44:04.134
HIT ME, IT WOULD STILL BE TRUE.

44:04.140 --> 44:10.170
Julia: MATT, I'M SO SORRY.

44:10.180 --> 44:13.172
[CRYING] YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND

44:13.180 --> 44:14.442
NONE OF THIS CHANGES THE

44:14.450 --> 44:17.749
WAY THAT I FEEL ABOUT YOU, THE

44:17.750 --> 44:19.741
WAY YOUR DAD FEELS ABOUT YOU.

44:19.750 --> 44:22.389
Matt: DOES HE EVEN KNOW? OR HAVE

44:22.390 --> 44:23.755
YOU BEEN LYING TO HIM THIS WHOLE

44:23.760 --> 44:24.954
TIME, TOO?

44:24.960 --> 44:26.427
Sean: ABOUT WHAT?

44:30.900 --> 44:32.197
LYING ABOUT WHAT? WHAT THE

44:32.200 --> 44:40.039
HELL'S GOING ON IN HERE?

44:40.040 --> 44:45.899
Matt: AVA AND I HAVE BEEN SEEING

44:45.910 --> 44:49.277
EACH OTHER. WE SLEPT TOGETHER.

44:49.280 --> 44:53.319
Sean: WHAT? SINCE WHEN? YOU JUST

44:53.320 --> 44:56.153
FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS?

44:56.160 --> 45:02.258
Matt: IT'S OVER.

45:02.260 --> 45:10.497
[CRYING] DAD...

45:10.500 --> 45:17.099
Sean: HEY, IT'S OK, MATT.

45:17.110 --> 45:22.468
WE'LL FIGURE THIS OUT. IT'S OK.
