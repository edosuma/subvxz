WEBVTT

00:03.671 --> 00:06.140
(all talking at once)

00:06.174 --> 00:10.144
We will have so much
winning if I get elected,

00:10.178 --> 00:12.546
that you may get
bored with winning.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.448
(crowd cheering)
Believe me.

00:14.482 --> 00:16.517
I agree-- you'll never
get bored with winning.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.219
We never get bored!

00:18.252 --> 00:21.522
(speaking Russian)

00:21.555 --> 00:23.457
(echoing boom)

00:23.491 --> 00:24.692
(whooshing)

00:24.725 --> 00:27.595
(men speaking excitedly
in Russian)

00:29.263 --> 00:31.665
(whooshing)

00:31.699 --> 00:34.235
(Russian pop music playing)

00:35.569 --> 00:37.571
(whooshing)

00:40.208 --> 00:41.842
(whooshing)

00:41.875 --> 00:44.812
(rumbling)

00:44.845 --> 00:46.480
(woman screams)

00:48.449 --> 00:51.452
SANDERS: When you give
tax breaks to billionaires...

00:51.485 --> 00:53.454
CLINTON: ...a way that is
consistent with our values...

00:53.487 --> 00:55.623
TRUMP: ...stand in the middle of
5th Avenue and shoot somebody,

00:55.656 --> 00:57.258
and I wouldn't lose any voters.

00:57.291 --> 00:58.792
This is a disaster.

00:58.826 --> 01:01.529
How am I supposed to get
that money in a week? I can't...

01:01.562 --> 01:03.131
Okay.

01:03.164 --> 01:06.300
Yeah, I'll deal with it
when I get back to L.A.

01:06.334 --> 01:08.169
Yep. Talk to you.

01:08.202 --> 01:10.704
(sighs):
Damn it.

01:10.738 --> 01:13.574
(news programs continue)

01:13.607 --> 01:16.177
CLINTON: You may not like
the answer, but I'll tell you...

01:16.210 --> 01:18.779
(piano playing)
(party chatter, laughter)

01:19.847 --> 01:21.515
(laughter)

01:22.583 --> 01:24.185
I know you

01:24.218 --> 01:26.354
from somewhere,
don't I?
I don't think so.

01:26.387 --> 01:27.621
Yeah. Becky.

01:27.655 --> 01:29.323
Laurel.
Right. Doug Stetler,

01:29.357 --> 01:30.858
legislative aide
to Mark Petina.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.693
You work for
Barbara Boxer, right?

01:32.726 --> 01:34.595
No.
You Senate or House?

01:34.628 --> 01:35.696
Neither.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.231
DoD? Pentagon?

01:37.265 --> 01:39.233
I'm sorry. I...
White House?

01:39.267 --> 01:40.768
I'm a documentary
filmmaker.

01:40.801 --> 01:42.836
I'm out here
for the weekend from L.A.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.238
Oh, great.

01:44.272 --> 01:45.739
It was nice meeting you.

01:45.773 --> 01:48.609
Mm.
MAN: Sorry we're late.
We got stuck

01:48.642 --> 01:50.211
at the Kennedy Center.
Ah. No problem.

01:50.244 --> 01:51.345
Oh, you look
beautiful, Germaine.

01:51.379 --> 01:52.746
GERMAINE:
Thank you.

01:52.780 --> 01:53.881
How many
months?

01:53.914 --> 01:55.916
Sis? What?
Look at you.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.518
I didn't know
you'd make it.

01:57.551 --> 01:59.387
Oh, of course.
Mom got me a ticket.

01:59.420 --> 02:01.222
Oh, hey, Germaine.
Laurel's here.

02:01.255 --> 02:02.523
Oh, thank
goodness.
Hi.

02:02.556 --> 02:04.558
I'll have somebody to talk to.

02:04.592 --> 02:05.726
Laurel Healy!
Of course!

02:05.759 --> 02:07.261
I thought I knew who...
Hey, Doug.

02:07.295 --> 02:08.629
No. I know who they are.

02:08.662 --> 02:10.298
I work with
Mark Patina.

02:10.331 --> 02:11.532
(piano continues playing)

02:11.565 --> 02:14.435
Wow, look at you.
Bodyguards.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.737
Yeah. Well, you used
to make fun of me;
now I'm powerful.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.472
Oh, I'm still
gonna make fun of you.
WOMAN: Senator,

02:18.506 --> 02:20.208
sorry, you have
that budget call.

02:20.241 --> 02:21.709
The Smithsonian.
Oh.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.644
I'll catch you later.
It's fine.
No, no.

02:23.677 --> 02:25.579
If I have to work, you're
gonna keep me company.

02:25.613 --> 02:27.481
Hey, make me one of
your mojitos, hmm?

02:27.515 --> 02:29.583
So, what did Dad
do to my room?

02:29.617 --> 02:31.785
It looks like a Bond
villain lives there now.

02:31.819 --> 02:34.555
(chuckles): Yeah.
He's consulting with
Armed Services now.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.557
Armed Services?
Why Armed Services?

02:36.590 --> 02:38.626
Why not?
Something Hirschhorn got him.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.761
How are things
in L.A.?
Fine.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.430
Yeah? Sounds fine.

02:42.463 --> 02:45.333
Having trouble with
your student loans, or...?
No.

02:45.366 --> 02:48.602
I just, uh, I had the financing
fall through on a film.

02:48.636 --> 02:49.870
The documentary
on religious music

02:49.903 --> 02:51.372
in Bora Bora?
That's a shocker.

02:51.405 --> 02:52.606
Solomon Islands.
(laughs):
Solomon Islands.

02:52.640 --> 02:53.607
Yeah.
Wow.

02:53.641 --> 02:55.409
No, it took me a year

02:55.443 --> 02:57.778
to get $200,000-- now I'm
gonna have to start over.

02:57.811 --> 03:00.348
Why don't you do something
people want to see, like...
gun control? Hey,

03:00.381 --> 03:02.783
I can get you an NEA grant
tomorrow...
Okay, how about

03:02.816 --> 03:05.386
we let Laurel control her own
life for a few hours, please?

03:05.419 --> 03:06.754
Thank you.
Ah.

03:06.787 --> 03:08.422
No, sir.
No, I am still here.

03:08.456 --> 03:09.890
I did not have you on mute.

03:09.923 --> 03:12.526
No. No, I understand,
Dr. Daudier,

03:12.560 --> 03:14.295
but the Republicans want
to decimate your budget.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.664
No, I know it's science
and I know it's important.

03:16.697 --> 03:17.965
I don't think you understand

03:17.998 --> 03:19.700
how important, Senator.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.569
We're conducting
a joint operation

03:21.602 --> 03:24.572
with the Russian Institute
on the retrieval of a meteor.

03:24.605 --> 03:26.374
Shut that off!

03:26.407 --> 03:28.576
Is there any way we can get
an additional $40 million?

03:28.609 --> 03:29.810
No.

03:29.843 --> 03:31.512
No, I might be able
to get you five,

03:31.545 --> 03:33.447
but my office will have
to personally sign off

03:33.481 --> 03:34.782
on expenditures.

03:34.815 --> 03:37.318
Okay, let me see what I can do.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.388
(sighs)

03:40.421 --> 03:42.690
Dr. Lagunov, hello!

03:42.723 --> 03:44.792
We have a bit of a problem.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.794
We're about to bring
the meteor up now.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.696
Yes, unfortunately, uh...

03:48.729 --> 03:51.565
is there any way
you can do it...

03:51.599 --> 03:53.267
cheaper?

03:53.301 --> 03:54.835
(sighs)

03:57.004 --> 03:59.507
(speaks Russian)

04:02.543 --> 04:05.646
(worker belches)

04:05.679 --> 04:08.916
*

04:08.949 --> 04:10.918
(speaking Russian quietly)

04:10.951 --> 04:12.420
(shouts in Russian)

04:12.453 --> 04:14.254
(mechanical groaning, creaking)

04:15.856 --> 04:17.925
*

04:32.606 --> 04:34.642
*

04:34.675 --> 04:37.445
I think you should come home.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.713
I think I am home,
in L.A.

04:39.747 --> 04:41.382
No, home here.

04:41.415 --> 04:43.384
We're on the verge of
a governmental shutdown.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.419
Luke doesn't trust
anyone on his staff...

04:45.453 --> 04:46.654
Don't, Dad.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.088
What?
Don't play the guilt card.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.790
There's a position
open in his office.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.659
Just do it for a year,

04:51.692 --> 04:54.562
until we get out of
this budget crisis.
I hate politics.

04:54.595 --> 04:56.997
I hate D.C.
That's why you'll
be so great at it.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.666
Look...

04:58.699 --> 05:01.068
I know you never wanted help
with your student loans,

05:01.101 --> 05:03.804
but do it for a year
and I'll pay 'em off.

05:08.942 --> 05:12.813
Okay. I need $200,000
to complete my documentary.

05:12.846 --> 05:15.749
I will do this job
for six months
if you finance half.

05:15.783 --> 05:17.951
Laurel, this is
for your brother.
No, it's not.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.687
This is about you wanting
someone in his office,

05:19.720 --> 05:20.854
someone to keep you informed.

05:20.888 --> 05:22.423
Oh...
I know how you work, Dad.

05:22.456 --> 05:24.858
I love you, but you
live off information.

05:24.892 --> 05:26.560
A year.
Six months.

05:26.594 --> 05:29.763
That's it.
I'm not negotiating.

05:31.399 --> 05:32.666
Deal.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.402
Love you.

05:36.770 --> 05:39.540
*

05:59.627 --> 06:03.030
Hello. It's my first day...
It's not up to us.

06:03.063 --> 06:04.164
It's the Republicans.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.566
I understand that.

06:05.599 --> 06:07.435
Gridlock. If the senate

06:07.468 --> 06:10.103
doesn't break their budgetary
tie in the next ten hours,

06:10.137 --> 06:12.172
the government
will officially shut down.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.507
WOMAN:
Laurel?

06:13.541 --> 06:14.908
Yes.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.043
You ready to get started?

06:16.076 --> 06:18.011
Yes.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.880
Sorry, we're
a bit crazed here, Laurel.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.749
The senator needs everyone
on the budget,

06:21.782 --> 06:24.184
so you'll be on your own
with C.C., if that's all right.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.653
Uh, C.C.?

06:25.686 --> 06:27.588
Oh, the senator
didn't fill you in?

06:27.621 --> 06:28.922
Constituent casework.

06:28.956 --> 06:30.791
There are
eight constituents

06:30.824 --> 06:32.760
who want a meeting
with the senator.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.495
You will investigate
their complaints--

06:34.528 --> 06:36.129
this is your brother's office--

06:36.163 --> 06:38.999
and then you'll do what you can
to satisfy their complaints.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.167
This...

06:40.200 --> 06:43.170
is where you'll
be meeting them.

06:43.203 --> 06:46.907
And then you'll give them these
pens, caps and signed photos.

06:46.940 --> 06:49.042
It's all about getting them
to vote next election,

06:49.076 --> 06:50.911
so just keep them happy.

06:50.944 --> 06:53.514
I'll be right down the hall
if you need anything. Good luck.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.892
Hi. I'm Laurel.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.495
You're all meeting
with me today.

07:07.528 --> 07:08.862
I guess.

07:08.896 --> 07:11.198
It's my first day,
so, you know...

07:11.231 --> 07:13.667
go easy on me.
(chuckles)

07:18.806 --> 07:20.841
(clears throat softly)

07:20.874 --> 07:24.211
It says here you're
having Social Security
problems, Claire?

07:24.244 --> 07:26.780
I don't have
Social Security problems.

07:26.814 --> 07:29.082
You have
Social Security problems.

07:29.116 --> 07:32.553
Right. And how
may I help you with...

07:32.586 --> 07:36.624
my... Social Security problems?

07:36.657 --> 07:39.493
It's a rash, it's not
a preexisting condition.

07:39.527 --> 07:41.495
And the Medicare doctor
was so rude.

07:41.529 --> 07:42.696
He said, uh,

07:42.730 --> 07:44.798
"That's just a rash."

07:44.832 --> 07:46.734
(chuckles):
Huh! A rash!

07:46.767 --> 07:48.802
I really want to give it
to the senator.
Yes.

07:48.836 --> 07:51.271
It's just, the senator's
a bit busy, so...

07:51.304 --> 07:54.575
Why are you trying
to keep me from him?

07:54.608 --> 07:57.578
Yes, yes. Hi. She's having
Social Security problems.

07:57.611 --> 07:59.580
(car horn honks in distance)

07:59.613 --> 08:01.615
Why can't you help me?
(laughs)

08:01.649 --> 08:03.083
No, no, please don't...

08:03.116 --> 08:04.952
please don't put me on hold.
Just...

08:04.985 --> 08:06.486
(beep)

08:09.623 --> 08:13.226
(choir singing
in foreign language)

08:13.260 --> 08:15.763
*

08:17.865 --> 08:20.067
(beep)
Hello. Yes. Yes, yes.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.702
I'm here. Hi.

08:21.735 --> 08:23.937
Yep, that's me.
The Social Security lady.

08:23.971 --> 08:25.606
(laughs softly)

08:25.639 --> 08:26.607
No, no, no.

08:26.640 --> 08:27.675
No, no. No, no. Don't..

08:27.708 --> 08:28.876
(beep)

08:28.909 --> 08:30.544
(Luke chuckles)
Come on!

08:30.578 --> 08:31.879
Having fun?

08:31.912 --> 08:33.814
Yeah, yeah.
What's not to like?

08:33.847 --> 08:36.750
Uh... I'm glad
you're here, sis.

08:36.784 --> 08:39.052
It's good to have
a friendly face.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.022
What's that?

08:42.055 --> 08:43.757
A chocolate dog.

08:43.791 --> 08:45.125
Why?

08:45.158 --> 08:46.760
I don't know.
Hello.

08:46.794 --> 08:49.162
This is Senator Healy.
What is your name, dear?

08:49.196 --> 08:52.833
Yeah, well, listen, Joan,
I need you to get your ass in
gear and help my constituent,

08:52.866 --> 08:54.768
or I'm personally cutting
your incidental budget by 40%.

08:54.802 --> 08:55.836
Do you understand?

08:55.869 --> 08:56.870
Good.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.641
You know, don't be afraid
to use my power.

09:05.679 --> 09:06.947
Mmm.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.786
Ms. Burke.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.788
Looks like it's just us now.

09:14.822 --> 09:16.924
BURKE: I don't even know
how to say this.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.659
My husband Randall...

09:18.692 --> 09:21.695
he's not my husband anymore.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.698
He's not?

09:24.732 --> 09:27.000
His manners, his speech,
his drinking...

09:27.034 --> 09:29.069
He needs
a drug and alcohol program?
No.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.871
He used to drink a lot.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.673
And now he doesn't.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.274
At all.

09:35.308 --> 09:37.110
Okay.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.846
I guess I'm-I'm
not really sure

09:38.879 --> 09:41.014
how I can help.
He works as an engineer

09:41.048 --> 09:43.350
on a container ship, The Alba.

09:43.383 --> 09:46.353
He just got back
from a crossing, and...

09:46.386 --> 09:49.089
I found this.

09:49.122 --> 09:51.291
RANDALL: We're recording this
for insurance purposes.

09:51.324 --> 09:55.696
We heard a noise
inside dry container C-744.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.865
That's why we're
breaking the seal.

10:00.668 --> 10:02.335
(metallic creaking)

10:04.271 --> 10:06.106
MAN: I don't see anything.
Let's go get the captain.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.975
RANDALL:
Take the camera. Come on.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.309
MAN:
Randall...

10:09.342 --> 10:11.011
That's my husband
right there.

10:11.044 --> 10:13.013
(whispers):
Let's go.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.750
Watch your step.

10:18.418 --> 10:21.889
Oh, my gosh,
something got out, man.

10:21.922 --> 10:24.758
What's in there?
I don't know.

10:24.792 --> 10:27.861
It looks like a big rock.

10:27.895 --> 10:29.129
(squeak)
What is it?
What's that?

10:29.162 --> 10:30.798
Oh, man!
Check it out.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.332
Come on.
Look... What's back there?

10:32.365 --> 10:33.901
I'm not going...
Come on, man.

10:33.934 --> 10:35.168
Randall, God...

10:35.202 --> 10:37.170
There's nothing back...
Check it out.

10:37.204 --> 10:38.405
Randall...

10:38.438 --> 10:39.873
(Randall screams)

10:39.907 --> 10:44.678
Something happened
to Randall on that ship,

10:44.712 --> 10:46.747
something that was
in that container,

10:46.780 --> 10:48.882
and I need your help
finding out what.

10:48.916 --> 10:50.450
MAN:
Laurel Healy?

10:50.483 --> 10:52.753
Do you have a minute?

10:52.786 --> 10:56.289
No. No. Um, could you just fill
out a form in the waiting room,

10:56.323 --> 10:57.791
and I'll be right with you?
Oh, no, actually,

10:57.825 --> 10:58.959
I don't have time.
Sir...

10:58.992 --> 11:01.028
I'm with someone
right now.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.429
Okay.

11:02.462 --> 11:03.931
I'm sorry, Ms. Burke.

11:03.964 --> 11:06.299
Have you gone to the
police or a doctor?

11:06.333 --> 11:08.836
No. I came here first.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.137
Why here?

11:10.170 --> 11:11.839
The crate is yours.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.140
I called
the navy shipyard.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.875
Your office signed off
on its delivery.

11:14.908 --> 11:17.477
Our office?
What was in it?

11:17.510 --> 11:19.412
They didn't say.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.915
MONARCH:
94 minutes.

11:21.949 --> 11:24.117
That's all that stands between
us and fiscal Armageddon,

11:24.151 --> 11:26.086
all because, as many believe,

11:26.119 --> 11:28.321
Republicans have collectively
lost their minds.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.123
What started
as simple brinkmanship

11:30.157 --> 11:31.859
on a Supreme Court nominee...

11:31.892 --> 11:34.194
One second, sir.
...has now expanded
into all-out war

11:34.227 --> 11:37.464
over the direction of our...
He's on the senate floor.
What do you need?

11:37.497 --> 11:39.266
Is there any reason
we would have signed off

11:39.299 --> 11:40.768
on a crate being
shipped from Russia?

11:40.801 --> 11:42.335
Excuse me?

11:42.369 --> 11:45.773
But, please, if you ever
need someone to speak to you,

11:45.806 --> 11:47.140
don't hesitate
to call us.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.042
Nothing. Nothing.
I'll handle it.

11:49.076 --> 11:50.911
LAUREL:
So,

11:50.944 --> 11:53.346
you're having problems with
your Viagra prescription, sir?

11:53.380 --> 11:55.048
(laughs):
No.
Says here,

11:55.082 --> 11:56.784
"Viagra not covered
by Medicaid," Mr. Flannigan.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.018
I'm not Mr. Flannigan.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.386
I'm Gareth Ritter,

11:59.419 --> 12:01.088
Legislative Director
for Senator Wheatus.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.291
Red Wheatus?

12:04.324 --> 12:06.827
He's the Republican
senator from Maryland?

12:06.860 --> 12:08.428
Yes. Yes, I know.

12:08.461 --> 12:11.298
I mean, I don't...
I don't know, but, um...

12:11.331 --> 12:14.001
Would-would you like me to get
a more senior staff person?

12:14.034 --> 12:15.368
No, I don't need senior.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.304
I need the sister.
I'm here to offer a deal

12:17.337 --> 12:18.872
on behalf of Senator Wheatus.

12:18.906 --> 12:20.307
Actually, I'm not
here at all.
You're not?

12:20.340 --> 12:22.309
No. And if your brother tries
to use this, if he tries

12:22.342 --> 12:23.543
to get mileage out of this
by embarrassing the Republicans,

12:23.576 --> 12:25.245
we'll deny
this meeting ever happened.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.247
Okay, I think
I should get somebody.
Ms. Healy,

12:27.280 --> 12:29.116
there are now 90 minutes
until the government shuts down.

12:29.149 --> 12:30.517
My boss is ready
to cross the aisle

12:30.550 --> 12:32.385
and vote with the Democrats.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.288
All he needs is a $48 million
earmark for autism studies.

12:35.322 --> 12:36.556
It's a pet cause of his.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.025
Okay, seriously,
this is my first day...

12:38.058 --> 12:39.392
I'm out the door.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.061
This is my cell.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.330
Get your brother's agreement
in 90 minutes and call me,

12:43.363 --> 12:44.865
or my boss will be
forced to stand

12:44.898 --> 12:46.399
with his Republican
colleagues.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.135
And if anybody finds out
about this, the deal goes away.

12:48.168 --> 12:49.569
Do you understand?

12:49.602 --> 12:51.071
No.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.306
Ms. Healy, 100,000
government jobs depend

12:53.340 --> 12:56.143
on you getting to your brother
in the next 90 minutes

12:56.176 --> 12:58.178
and convincing him
to take this deal,

12:58.211 --> 13:00.447
so if I were you...

13:00.480 --> 13:02.950
I'd run.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.986
(door opens)

13:06.019 --> 13:08.355
(door closes)

13:12.059 --> 13:13.460
Luke, you've just
been offered a deal

13:13.493 --> 13:15.262
by a Republican senator
on the budget.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.964
We have 90 minutes.
(phone beeps)

13:16.997 --> 13:20.167
Yes, hello. It's me.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.269
Oh, Dad. Yeah.
Yeah, I'm just busy.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.603
Yes.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.138
I'm just checking in to see

13:25.172 --> 13:26.874
how things are going
on your first day.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.909
It's good. It's good.
Couldn't be better.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.277
Dad, can I call you back?

13:30.310 --> 13:32.179
Why? Is something going on?
No.

13:32.212 --> 13:34.047
Just... I'm gonna call you back.

13:34.081 --> 13:36.083
(phone beeps off, sighs)

13:44.224 --> 13:45.926
No running in the
Capitol, ma'am.

13:45.959 --> 13:48.361
No fast-walking, either.

13:48.395 --> 13:52.032
Laurel? Laurel Healy?

13:52.065 --> 13:55.035
Senator Spitz. I saw
you at your dad's party.

13:55.068 --> 13:57.137
Oh, yes, hi. Um, is Luke
on the senate floor?

13:57.170 --> 13:58.972
No, he left for dinner
ten minutes ago.

13:59.006 --> 14:01.041
Are you all right?
You seem out of breath.

14:01.074 --> 14:02.943
No. I mean, yes. I...

14:02.976 --> 14:05.378
I need to know where he went.
Do you know?

14:05.412 --> 14:08.215
Yes, he was here a few minutes
ago, but then he left.

14:08.248 --> 14:10.617
Okay, I have 40 minutes
to get in touch with him.

14:10.650 --> 14:13.353
Do you know where he went?
Please. I'm his sister.

14:13.386 --> 14:14.988
Oh, here's my driver's license.

14:15.022 --> 14:17.124
I had pink hair back then.
I wanted to be a poet.

14:17.157 --> 14:19.492
I don't know where he went,
but I don't think it was work.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.328
He was with a woman.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.931
Germaine. Thank you.
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

14:23.964 --> 14:27.034
No, a red-headed woman.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.272
(shouting):
Scarlett?

14:32.305 --> 14:34.674
It's Laurel.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.244
The office said you were home.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.412
(sighs)

14:39.446 --> 14:41.148
Luke, I know you're in there.

14:41.181 --> 14:44.017
(gasps)

14:44.051 --> 14:46.987
(sighs)
Crap.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.355
(loud, overlapping chatter
over phone)

14:48.388 --> 14:50.023
Senators, gentlemen, wait.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.691
Do we make the deal?

14:51.724 --> 14:54.227
That's all we need to answer,
and we only have...

14:54.261 --> 14:55.662
Nine minutes to decide.

14:55.695 --> 14:57.164
MAN:
Look, the Republicans
are scared.

14:57.197 --> 14:59.166
I say we use this
to embarrass them.

14:59.199 --> 15:01.168
LAUREL:
No, no, he said if you did that,
he would deny it.

15:01.201 --> 15:03.170
Who's "he"? And who is talking?

15:03.203 --> 15:04.637
It's my sister.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.173
SPITZ:
I say we take the deal.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.175
All Red wants is $48 million
in earmarks.

15:08.208 --> 15:11.078
LUKE:
Or we collect on their media
hit, then make the deal.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.712
Let the Republicans shut down
the government.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.647
It's bad for them, bad for
their presidential candidate.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.183
Why would we get in the way

15:16.216 --> 15:17.584
of them shooting themselves
in the foot?

15:17.617 --> 15:20.120
Because it's 100,000
people out of work.

15:21.754 --> 15:26.026
LUKE:
I apologize.
Any other opinions?

15:27.627 --> 15:29.729
They're gonna let it close.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.099
It's the smart move.

15:32.132 --> 15:35.202
God, I hate politics.

15:35.235 --> 15:37.670
I'm a child of divorce.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.742
This isn't serious
with your brother.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.377
It's just...

15:44.411 --> 15:46.079
blowing off steam.

15:46.113 --> 15:47.647
Okay.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.482
(door opens)
LUKE:
Okay.

15:49.516 --> 15:50.984
(clears his throat)

15:51.018 --> 15:52.986
So we're gonna let
the deadline pass.

15:53.020 --> 15:55.755
Luke, this is wrong.
It's just $48 million.
Yes, and we're looking

15:55.788 --> 15:58.291
to the long game. It's about
who'll be the next president,

15:58.325 --> 16:00.093
who'll choose the next
Supreme Court justice.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.329
Ow! What's that about?

16:02.362 --> 16:04.497
Cheating on Germaine.
It-It's, it-it's not cheating.

16:04.531 --> 16:06.299
Well, it's not
what you think. Ow!

16:06.333 --> 16:08.135
Stop it! Ow!
I will as soon as you do.

16:08.168 --> 16:09.602
Are you kidding me?

16:09.636 --> 16:12.172
She's eight months pregnant.
Look, it was a mistake.

16:12.205 --> 16:14.307
Okay? Now, I need to go
upstairs to change.

16:14.341 --> 16:17.377
Are you all right with that,
or do you want to hit me again?

16:17.410 --> 16:21.548
Oh, I do, but I won't. Go on.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.487
(sighs)

16:27.520 --> 16:30.123
(sighs)

16:30.157 --> 16:31.458
(phone ringing)
Hello.

16:31.491 --> 16:34.527
Hi. It's Laurel. Healy.

16:34.561 --> 16:36.029
So...

16:36.063 --> 16:37.364
You're passing?

16:37.397 --> 16:40.667
They just...

16:40.700 --> 16:43.270
don't want to make a deal...
just yet.

16:43.303 --> 16:44.737
Okay, but

16:44.771 --> 16:46.239
when you see all those people

16:46.273 --> 16:47.674
out of work tomorrow,
that's on you.

16:47.707 --> 16:50.210
(beep)

16:53.413 --> 16:56.683
There's something odd
under the fusion crust.

16:56.716 --> 17:00.487
It's a honeycomb structure,
but it's not organic.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.389
It's... structured...

17:02.422 --> 17:04.257
Dr. Daudier, it's time to go.

17:04.291 --> 17:06.693
Excuse me?
We're shutting down.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.461
This is the crate from Russia.
Everybody's being sent home.

17:08.495 --> 17:10.297
You're out of money.
We have to get this into
storage.

17:10.330 --> 17:11.598
Hey, you guys were supposed
to be gone already.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.133
It's the budget shutdown.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.434
It'll be here
when we get back.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.169
Let's go. Come on.
When we get back?

17:16.203 --> 17:18.138
We've had meeting
after meeting about this day.

17:18.171 --> 17:21.308
You were supposed to be
prepared already.
This is ridiculous.

17:21.341 --> 17:23.610
(loud clacking)

17:32.485 --> 17:34.387
(rustling)

17:42.195 --> 17:45.198
*

18:12.159 --> 18:14.161
(siren wailing)

18:35.382 --> 18:37.617
(wind whistling)

18:51.498 --> 18:54.367
LUKE: The last thing I wanted
was to hurt

18:54.401 --> 18:57.370
any of the talented people
who keep this place running.

18:57.404 --> 19:01.308
Unfortunately, the Republican
shutdown will force this office

19:01.341 --> 19:03.543
to furlough all but two of you.

19:03.576 --> 19:06.279
Now, I know.
Look, I will work full-time

19:06.313 --> 19:07.647
to turn on the lights again,

19:07.680 --> 19:09.882
so I'll need my chief of staff
to stay.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.551
And I'll need
my constituent caseworker.

19:11.584 --> 19:15.822
The rest of you: go home,
get some rest, hug your kids.

19:15.855 --> 19:17.557
And come back

19:17.590 --> 19:19.392
ready to work once
this is all over.

19:19.426 --> 19:21.828
Okay? Keep your heads up. Hmm?

19:21.861 --> 19:24.397
(applause)
We'll see you soon.

19:26.566 --> 19:28.835
LAUREL:
Luke, come on.

19:28.868 --> 19:31.838
You don't need me.
I said I needed you.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.806
You're just doing this
'cause I'm your sister.
Laurel,

19:33.840 --> 19:35.442
if you feel bad,
then work twice as hard.

19:35.475 --> 19:37.577
Hey, bud. Yeah.

19:37.610 --> 19:40.613
Did those numbers
come back in? In the...

19:41.948 --> 19:44.317
("You Might Think"
by The Cars playing)

19:44.351 --> 19:46.386
So, what's this about again?

19:46.419 --> 19:47.920
One of our constituents worries

19:47.954 --> 19:50.690
that her husband, a first mate
on your ship, was...

19:50.723 --> 19:52.325
sickened by some cargo.

19:52.359 --> 19:53.726
Sickened? How?

19:53.760 --> 19:56.663
She said he came back changed.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.465
Could you turn
the music down, sir?

19:58.498 --> 20:03.870
Look, lady, everybody comes back
a little changed from the sea.

20:03.903 --> 20:06.005
You're out there
for four weeks.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.441
You got seasickness,
you got the time change.

20:08.475 --> 20:10.877
Sometimes it takes your family
a while to adapt to you

20:10.910 --> 20:13.680
and you a while
to adapt to them.

20:13.713 --> 20:16.283
* To have something to do

20:16.316 --> 20:18.017
* But I think
that you're wild... *

20:18.050 --> 20:19.886
Don't you want to know
who the crew member was?

20:19.919 --> 20:22.322
What?
I mean, it just seems

20:22.355 --> 20:23.956
like a natural reaction
to my question.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.858
"Which crew member
are we talking about?"

20:25.892 --> 20:28.761
I'm a little busy right now.

20:28.795 --> 20:30.897
Is there anything
else you need?

20:30.930 --> 20:32.965
Yes, the cargo manifest.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.767
Why do you need
the cargo manifest?

20:34.801 --> 20:38.405
Just need to check
on something for my boss.

20:41.408 --> 20:42.642
You know Randall Burke?

20:42.675 --> 20:44.911
No, who's that?

20:44.944 --> 20:46.779
Randall Burke.

20:46.813 --> 20:50.016
You were... you were
seen in a video with him,

20:50.049 --> 20:51.651
below deck, opening a container.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.753
I have no idea what
you're talking about, ma'am.

20:53.786 --> 20:57.390
* But I think that you're wild

20:57.424 --> 21:01.528
* When you flash
that fragile smile *

21:01.561 --> 21:04.063
* You might think
it's foolish... *

21:04.096 --> 21:06.799
Okay, I just need the manifest.

21:06.833 --> 21:09.336
I wish you congressional aides
would talk to each other.

21:09.369 --> 21:11.704
I gave it out
to another guy this morning.

21:11.738 --> 21:14.941
Who?
Someone named Gareth?

21:14.974 --> 21:18.511
Gareth?

21:25.518 --> 21:28.455
TRUMP (on TV):
Turned down so much money.
I feel so foolish.

21:28.488 --> 21:31.424
I feel so... You know, my whole
life, I take, right? Greedy.

21:31.458 --> 21:33.426
I take. I take. Greedy! Greedy!

21:33.460 --> 21:35.595
The government shutdown,
widely blamed

21:35.628 --> 21:37.597
on the Democrats in Congress,
(sighs)

21:37.630 --> 21:40.099
continues to devastate
the local economy.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.834
Angry workers took...

21:41.868 --> 21:43.570
Hello?

21:43.603 --> 21:46.339
(loud snoring)

21:48.675 --> 21:51.578
(loud snoring)

21:51.611 --> 21:54.914
Hey. You the masseuse?

21:54.947 --> 21:56.583
The what?

21:56.616 --> 21:58.017
The masseuse.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.586
It's, uh...

21:59.619 --> 22:00.887
(laughs)

22:00.920 --> 22:03.990
It's my adductors.

22:04.023 --> 22:07.427
They... they need
special attention.

22:08.628 --> 22:09.962
No.

22:09.996 --> 22:11.364
(snores)

22:11.398 --> 22:12.799
(phone rings)

22:12.832 --> 22:16.736
GARETH:
Senator Wheatus' office.
I'm sorry,

22:16.769 --> 22:18.938
the senator's out
to lunch right now.

22:18.971 --> 22:20.973
Can I please take a message?

22:22.442 --> 22:23.876
Look, I'm not here about the...

22:23.910 --> 22:25.445
stuff yesterday.

22:25.478 --> 22:28.515
You have the ship manifest
for Ms. Bur...

22:28.548 --> 22:29.782
The stuff yesterday?

22:29.816 --> 22:31.083
You mean the 20 Hill staffers

22:31.117 --> 22:32.719
that I sent home
unemployed in tears?

22:32.752 --> 22:35.388
Come on. The Republicans
are just as much to blame

22:35.422 --> 22:38.425
as the Democrats.

22:38.458 --> 22:39.626
And why are you helping
Ms. Burke anyway?

22:39.659 --> 22:41.661
She's our constituent.

22:43.463 --> 22:45.064
I saw you in our waiting room,
trying to poach her.

22:45.097 --> 22:47.534
Poaching, seriously?
She only asked for my help

22:47.567 --> 22:49.936
because she knew you
couldn't handle it.

22:49.969 --> 22:51.638
And would you stop
following me?

22:51.671 --> 22:54.541
I look like I'm collaborating
with the Democrats.

22:54.574 --> 22:56.909
Oh, Gareth, about that
pro-choice rally,

22:56.943 --> 22:58.945
what are you wearing?

23:02.949 --> 23:04.651
Scientific
research materials?

23:04.684 --> 23:05.818
Yeah, for the Smithsonian.

23:05.852 --> 23:07.420
Okayed by
your brother's office.

23:07.454 --> 23:08.755
Did you try
the Smithsonian?

23:08.788 --> 23:10.690
It was closed, due to
the government shutdown.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.560
Did you question the first mate?

23:13.593 --> 23:15.428
Yeah. Chuck Sanders.

23:15.462 --> 23:17.897
"Everybody comes back a little
changed after four weeks at sea.

23:17.930 --> 23:20.099
"Sometimes it takes your family
a while to adapt to you

23:20.132 --> 23:22.502
and you to adapt to them."

23:22.535 --> 23:23.803
That's what the
captain said.

23:23.836 --> 23:25.538
So?

23:25.572 --> 23:28.941
No, that's word for word
what the captain said.

23:28.975 --> 23:31.210
They agreed on a story.
Why agree on a story

23:31.243 --> 23:33.212
unless there's a reason
to agree on a story?

23:33.245 --> 23:35.915
Look.
It's your second day, right?

23:35.948 --> 23:37.784
There are plenty of reasons
to be paranoid in this town,

23:37.817 --> 23:38.985
you don't need
to create new ones.

23:39.018 --> 23:41.721
Oh, please tell me more
about this town.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.823
You know, I'm eating lunch,
so you can go.

23:46.993 --> 23:50.096
The senator may still be
interested in a deal.

23:50.129 --> 23:53.733
On the budget. You can get this
town back to work tomorrow.

23:53.766 --> 23:56.235
All you have to do is get
your brother to say yes.

23:56.268 --> 23:58.671
I'll talk to him.
Don't talk to him.

23:58.705 --> 24:00.573
Convince him.

24:01.874 --> 24:04.544
Why do I trust him?
Why not trust him?

24:04.577 --> 24:07.146
Senator Wheatus? He doesn't
give a damn about $48 million

24:07.179 --> 24:09.816
for autism. He only lives
to drink and screw.

24:09.849 --> 24:11.851
Now, his legislative director,
Gareth Ritter,

24:11.884 --> 24:14.253
on the other hand,
has a sister who is autistic.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.655
How do you know that?

24:15.688 --> 24:17.657
(clears throat)
I had Scarlett check.

24:17.690 --> 24:19.492
Oh, really, Scarlett?
How's she doing?
Oh, don't, don't.

24:19.526 --> 24:20.760
Look, I already
broke it off with her.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.662
You broke it off like
Dad broke it off

24:22.695 --> 24:24.163
with his secretary?
Oh, Dad?

24:24.196 --> 24:25.832
No, this is not
comparable, Laurel.
You almost

24:25.865 --> 24:27.734
killed him when you
found out. I left home

24:27.767 --> 24:29.702
when I found out.
Uh, do we really
got to talk about

24:29.736 --> 24:31.704
the whole boss-employee
dynamic here? Because...
Okay, fine, yes.

24:31.738 --> 24:34.240
Just remind me when I can be
a sister again, Senator.

24:36.776 --> 24:39.812
Look, make sure this Gareth guy
isn't freelancing,

24:39.846 --> 24:41.213
and I'll consider the deal.

24:41.247 --> 24:42.615
Good.
All right.

24:42.649 --> 24:45.718
What about this?

24:45.752 --> 24:47.720
Well, it's for a Dr. Daudier
at the Smithsonian.

24:47.754 --> 24:49.956
I said I needed to sign off
on his Russian expenditures

24:49.989 --> 24:51.724
piecemeal. And, hey,
don't get obsessed

24:51.758 --> 24:53.560
with any one constituent, okay?
You've got to keep

24:53.593 --> 24:56.095
a lot of constituents happy.
Are you listening to me?

24:57.163 --> 24:58.831
Have you noticed
something weird?

24:58.865 --> 25:00.166
What?

25:00.199 --> 25:01.901
People are staring at us.

25:01.934 --> 25:04.236
Hmm? Who?

25:04.270 --> 25:06.606
Those four people
over there.

25:08.340 --> 25:11.043
That waiter...

25:11.077 --> 25:13.079
over there.

25:14.280 --> 25:16.048
So?

25:16.082 --> 25:17.750
We're famous.

25:17.784 --> 25:20.853
It's like Hollywood
but with uglier people.

25:20.887 --> 25:22.889
Get used to it.

25:26.158 --> 25:27.727
(line ringing)

25:27.760 --> 25:29.261
BURKE:
Hello.

25:29.295 --> 25:31.798
Hi, this is Laurel
from Senator Healy's office.

25:31.831 --> 25:32.865
Oh.

25:32.899 --> 25:34.867
Hi.
As part of my casework,

25:34.901 --> 25:36.769
I just wanted to update you,
Ms. Burke.

25:36.803 --> 25:38.337
The crate--
from your husband's ship--

25:38.370 --> 25:40.807
I-I was able to trace it back
to the Smithsonian.

25:40.840 --> 25:43.175
A man named Dr. Daudier--
our office signed off

25:43.209 --> 25:44.744
on his deliveries from Russia.

25:44.777 --> 25:46.679
Who's that, dear?

25:46.713 --> 25:48.080
No one.

25:48.114 --> 25:50.950
Just Judy from class.

25:50.983 --> 25:53.019
Judy, why don't
we talk tomorrow?

25:53.052 --> 25:55.755
Is that your husband?
Is everything okay?

25:55.788 --> 25:57.924
Yes, thank you.
That sounds good.

25:57.957 --> 26:00.760
(beep)

26:00.793 --> 26:02.762
Did you see
what the Republicans said?

26:02.795 --> 26:04.030
No.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.632
They're insane.

26:05.665 --> 26:07.233
What is this world coming to?

26:07.266 --> 26:09.135
We need to do something.

26:19.411 --> 26:22.181
I'm sorry I haven't been myself.

26:22.214 --> 26:25.117
I think I've been
feeling a bit angry.

26:25.151 --> 26:27.153
About the world.

26:29.756 --> 26:33.092
That's nice. Good night.

26:34.794 --> 26:36.295
(chuckles)

26:36.328 --> 26:38.330
Randall, I need
to get some sleep.

26:42.769 --> 26:45.204
Randall, you need to let me go.

27:02.789 --> 27:05.324
I... I said let me go!

27:05.357 --> 27:07.660
Shh, shh, shh. Shh.

27:07.694 --> 27:09.829
It's okay, it's okay.

27:09.862 --> 27:11.363
Don't struggle,
or they'll hurt you.

27:11.397 --> 27:12.965
You're still
gonna be yourself,

27:12.999 --> 27:14.400
but a better part
of yourself.

27:14.433 --> 27:17.136
And we're gonna know each other
like never before.

27:17.169 --> 27:19.171
I love you.

27:28.715 --> 27:30.750
Are you asking me
if I'm freelancing?
Yes.

27:30.783 --> 27:32.318
We're in the middle
of the biggest budget crisis

27:32.351 --> 27:35.154
in four years and you think that
I would make up a budget offer

27:35.187 --> 27:37.223
from my boss?
Yes.

27:37.256 --> 27:39.425
Senator Wheatus doesn't give
a damn about autistic kids.

27:39.458 --> 27:42.428
You do. You have
an autistic sister.

27:42.461 --> 27:44.296
So, you've been
investigating me?

27:44.330 --> 27:47.199
I always find that best
when I don't trust someone.

27:47.233 --> 27:50.036
Okay, I'm gonna be
completely honest.
How refreshing.

27:50.069 --> 27:51.871
I told my boss that
the Democrats wanted a deal

27:51.904 --> 27:53.806
and they were offering
$48 million for autism

27:53.840 --> 27:55.708
to close it.
And he said yes,

27:55.742 --> 27:57.443
because I knew
he wanted to take a deal.

27:57.476 --> 27:59.746
He just didn't want to be
the first person to offer it.

27:59.779 --> 28:03.049
So you're lying?
I'm deal-making.

28:03.082 --> 28:05.084
Oh, come on, are you seriously
walking away from this?

28:05.117 --> 28:06.819
People are going hungry
over this.

28:06.853 --> 28:09.388
People can't pay their rent,
and all you have to do

28:09.421 --> 28:12.358
is convince your brother
to meet. That's all.

28:19.365 --> 28:20.833
He's not freelancing.

28:20.867 --> 28:22.334
Who?

28:22.368 --> 28:24.503
Gareth Ritter. He's not
lying. Senator Wheatus

28:24.536 --> 28:27.874
wants a deal. You want me to
set up a meeting with you two?

28:27.907 --> 28:29.308
Let me think about it.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.278
Luke, you need to do this.

28:32.311 --> 28:33.846
People are hurting.
(phone buzzes)

28:33.880 --> 28:36.415
People always hurt.

28:36.448 --> 28:39.986
Yeah. So, then,
what time's the interview?

28:40.019 --> 28:42.021
(continues indistinctly)

28:47.059 --> 28:48.527
Laurel, how are you?

28:48.560 --> 28:50.262
Good, Dad.
Can you do me a favor?

28:50.296 --> 28:51.864
Sure. What do you need?

28:51.898 --> 28:53.399
Don't tell Luke
I told you this, but I think

28:53.432 --> 28:55.301
he has a chance
to make a deal on the budget

28:55.334 --> 28:57.169
with a Republican senator,
and he's hesitating.

28:57.203 --> 28:58.771
Why?

28:58.805 --> 29:00.506
I don't know why.
But I think you need

29:00.539 --> 29:02.374
to convince him
it's good for his career.

29:02.408 --> 29:04.543
If he single-handedly puts
the government back to work,

29:04.576 --> 29:06.512
he'll be the leader
of the party.

29:06.545 --> 29:08.414
Why don't you tell him that?

29:08.447 --> 29:10.549
I'm his little sister.
He's not gonna listen to me,

29:10.582 --> 29:12.284
he's gonna listen to you.

29:13.519 --> 29:16.155
You may hate politics, Laurel,

29:16.188 --> 29:18.057
but you're not bad at it.

29:18.090 --> 29:19.258
(door opens)

29:19.291 --> 29:20.459
What?

29:20.492 --> 29:22.128
You did well.

29:22.161 --> 29:23.963
(door opens)

29:23.996 --> 29:25.464
This must be her.

29:25.497 --> 29:28.300
Laurel, thank you so much
for helping Breanna.

29:28.334 --> 29:30.336
They were just telling me
what a great job you did.

29:30.369 --> 29:32.338
Yes, I get a little
worried about Randall

29:32.371 --> 29:35.407
being away. Maybe even
a little paranoid.

29:35.441 --> 29:38.077
And Laurel was so great
at just hand-holding me.

29:38.110 --> 29:39.511
But now everything is great.

29:41.147 --> 29:43.883
Everybody comes back
a little changed from the sea.

29:43.916 --> 29:45.484
You're out there for four weeks.
Four weeks.

29:45.517 --> 29:47.219
Sometimes it takes your family
Sometimes it takes your family

29:47.253 --> 29:49.021
a while to adapt to you and
a while to adapt to you and

29:49.055 --> 29:51.023
you a while to adapt to them.
you a while to adapt to them.

29:52.624 --> 29:55.995
Uh, you know,
they want to give me $2,600

29:56.028 --> 29:57.229
for my reelection campaign.

29:57.263 --> 29:58.497
Isn't that great?
Anything to stop

29:58.530 --> 30:01.000
those Republicans
from ruining our country.

30:02.601 --> 30:04.803
Breanna, do you have a minute?

30:09.475 --> 30:11.043
Is he hurting you?

30:11.077 --> 30:12.912
What? No, we're good.

30:12.945 --> 30:15.314
Breanna, if there's some abuse
going on, all you have to do...

30:15.347 --> 30:17.917
Laurel. I'm happy.

30:17.950 --> 30:20.419
Don't question happiness.

30:20.452 --> 30:22.889
Ready to go, babe?
Mm.

30:26.592 --> 30:28.560
You know why he
brought her here?

30:28.594 --> 30:30.362
To give to my campaign?

30:30.396 --> 30:32.564
He wants to stop me
from investigating.

30:32.598 --> 30:35.267
Laurel, this is constituent
care, not Nancy Drew.

30:35.301 --> 30:37.036
They're happy. Take
yes for an answer.

30:37.069 --> 30:38.971
Senator.
Your father's on the line.

30:39.005 --> 30:40.306
(clears throat)

30:40.339 --> 30:41.540
Wonder what he wants.

30:47.914 --> 30:49.448
You must be Gareth Ritter.
I am, senator.

30:49.481 --> 30:51.283
You're not gonna
screw me, are you?
Sir?

30:51.317 --> 30:53.485
Get me to meet with your boss,
then leak it to the press

30:53.519 --> 30:55.922
so it looks like the Democrats
are desperate for a deal?
No, sir.

30:55.955 --> 30:57.089
So, where's Red?

30:57.123 --> 30:58.657
Right this way.
Ah.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.426
What the hell?

31:00.459 --> 31:02.194
You didn't tell me
it was a Democrat.

31:04.496 --> 31:05.664
(both chuckle)

31:05.697 --> 31:07.399
Senator.
Senator.

31:07.433 --> 31:09.268
You gonna join me
for a drink?

31:09.301 --> 31:12.538
Uh, sure. Why not?
It's 4:00 somewhere.

31:12.571 --> 31:14.573
(both laughing)

31:16.442 --> 31:18.410
Do you think they're even
talking about the budget?

31:18.444 --> 31:20.079
I think it may not matter.

31:20.112 --> 31:22.014
Hey, I caught that
documentary of yours online.

31:22.048 --> 31:24.550
The yodeling one.
What was it called?

31:24.583 --> 31:26.352
Yodeling.

31:26.385 --> 31:27.954
Right. It was good.

31:27.987 --> 31:29.221
Although it just
kind of ends.

31:29.255 --> 31:31.023
Well, it's unfinished.

31:31.057 --> 31:32.291
What's your
next one about?

31:32.324 --> 31:34.126
Melanesian choirs.

31:34.160 --> 31:36.262
Oh, my God.
You're kidding.

31:37.463 --> 31:38.664
Wait, you know what that is?
No.

31:40.399 --> 31:42.034
It's religious music
from the Solomon Islands.

31:42.068 --> 31:43.335
Oh, so you're
selling out.

31:45.137 --> 31:47.473
Why Melanesian choirs?

31:48.607 --> 31:50.042
You don't want to know.

31:50.076 --> 31:52.444
Yeah, I do.
I'm right here.

31:52.478 --> 31:55.114
Okay, well,
they're disappearing.

31:55.147 --> 31:57.649
Kids in the Solomon Islands all
want to listen to Taylor Swift.

31:57.683 --> 31:59.318
So you're an idealist?

31:59.351 --> 32:01.420
No. I just don't like it
when things disappear.

32:01.453 --> 32:04.957
That's a very Republican
thing to say. Liberals love

32:04.991 --> 32:06.625
when things disappear.
They do not.

32:06.658 --> 32:08.360
No, that's actually the
definition of being a liberal.

32:08.394 --> 32:09.595
Oh, my God, what a bigot.
Wha...

32:09.628 --> 32:11.330
So, their culture
is disappearing

32:11.363 --> 32:12.965
because of global warming.
Mm-hmm.

32:12.999 --> 32:14.666
So tell me-- what-what do
Republicans think about that?

32:14.700 --> 32:16.402
(laughing)

32:16.435 --> 32:18.404
You know... the biggest problem

32:18.437 --> 32:19.671
in this town?
Hmm?

32:19.705 --> 32:21.240
Ethic rules.

32:21.273 --> 32:23.342
Amen.
Yeah.
'Cause lobbyists used to

32:23.375 --> 32:25.411
throw these great parties.
Huge parties.

32:25.444 --> 32:26.678
Get us all liquored up.

32:26.712 --> 32:28.347
And it was all of us together,

32:28.380 --> 32:31.217
Democrats, Republicans,
all having a good time.

32:31.250 --> 32:33.619
Now they can't spend more
than eight dollars on any of us.

32:33.652 --> 32:37.656
Got those disgusting
little shrimp plates.

32:37.689 --> 32:42.228
Cash bars. I never talk
to any Democrats anymore.

32:42.261 --> 32:43.996
So, do they train you
to talk like this?

32:44.030 --> 32:45.231
No, I actually
learned it in a book.

32:45.264 --> 32:46.665
I di... Yeah.
Oh.

32:46.698 --> 32:48.367
("You Might Think"
by The Cars playing)

32:48.400 --> 32:51.103
There it is again-- that song.

32:51.137 --> 32:53.039
That's the third time
I've heard it today.

32:53.072 --> 32:54.373
Is it suddenly in again?

32:54.406 --> 32:56.408
The '80s are back, right?

33:01.747 --> 33:04.483
Something weird is happening.

33:04.516 --> 33:07.019
What?

33:07.053 --> 33:09.055
I don't know.

33:09.088 --> 33:12.358
You're very easily distracted,
aren't you?

33:12.391 --> 33:15.127
Here we go.
Okay.

33:15.161 --> 33:19.131
Noon tomorrow.
Joint press conference.
(chuckles) Gareth,

33:19.165 --> 33:21.333
it's time to leave
these communists.

33:21.367 --> 33:24.803
To the Town Car. Avante.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.805
Well?

33:26.838 --> 33:28.574
Well, it's
your third day,

33:28.607 --> 33:31.777
and I think you just saved
the D.C. economy.

33:31.810 --> 33:34.146
* You might think I'm crazy...

33:34.180 --> 33:35.247
(phone buzzing)

33:35.281 --> 33:37.483
* But all I want is you...

33:37.516 --> 33:39.351
Hi, Doctor.

33:39.385 --> 33:41.687
Thank you for returning my call.
You're welcome.

33:41.720 --> 33:46.125
You think that someone
was infected by my shipment?

33:46.158 --> 33:48.560
REPORTER: Hillary Clinton was
on the campaign trail...

33:48.594 --> 33:51.097
(reporter speaking indistinctly)

33:54.100 --> 33:56.435
(grunts)

34:03.609 --> 34:06.812
REPORTER:
Secretary Clinton is not
shrinking from the fight.

34:06.845 --> 34:08.547
While attacking Donald Trump

34:08.580 --> 34:11.083
in a more traditional method
of campaigning.

34:11.117 --> 34:14.453
CLINTON:
We hear a lot of negativity
and ideology

34:14.486 --> 34:17.223
coming from the candidates
on the other side,

34:17.256 --> 34:20.359
but I think it's important
to try to pierce that

34:20.392 --> 34:24.763
with some good old-fashioned
facts.

34:24.796 --> 34:27.366
REPORTER:
But will that be enough to face
the blistering attack

34:27.399 --> 34:30.102
coming from Donald Trump?

34:30.136 --> 34:32.338
TRUMP:
Hillary is the worst... Look,

34:32.371 --> 34:35.607
easily, she's
the worst secretary of state

34:35.641 --> 34:37.476
in the history of our country.

34:37.509 --> 34:40.379
She is going to be beaten,
and I'm the one to beat her.

34:40.412 --> 34:41.880
REPORTER:
But Trump is not...

34:41.913 --> 34:43.615
(snoring)

34:43.649 --> 34:46.318
SANDERS:
And let me be very clear
about this.

34:46.352 --> 34:50.122
This campaign
is not about Bernie Sanders.

34:50.156 --> 34:52.124
It is not about Hillary Clinton.

34:52.158 --> 34:54.760
It is not about anybody else.

34:54.793 --> 34:56.762
It is about you.

34:56.795 --> 34:59.265
(cheering and applause)

35:02.268 --> 35:04.136
(sloshing)
REPORTER: With tensions high

35:04.170 --> 35:06.772
and PACs dredging up scandals
from the 1990's and earlier,

35:06.805 --> 35:08.574
it's no wonder

35:08.607 --> 35:10.909
everyone seems to have politics
on the brain.

35:10.942 --> 35:14.513
CLINTON:
I would hope to be able
to enlist Bernie, uh,

35:14.546 --> 35:16.782
in helping me reach out
to his supporters.

35:16.815 --> 35:18.917
REPORTER:
Adding to the tension
is the defiant Bernie Sanders.

35:18.950 --> 35:21.453
SANDERS:
Don't let people tell you

35:21.487 --> 35:24.190
that you can't think big!

35:24.223 --> 35:25.924
(sighs)

35:25.957 --> 35:27.793
REPORTER:
The Democrats are
still struggling

35:27.826 --> 35:30.296
to fight
the unconventional campaign

35:30.329 --> 35:31.797
of that most most unconventional

35:31.830 --> 35:34.533
Republican candidate,
Donald Trump.

35:34.566 --> 35:35.867
Eight years ago, many Hillary
supporters swore

35:35.901 --> 35:37.269
they would never vote
for Barack Obama.

35:37.303 --> 35:38.904
But then many did.

35:38.937 --> 35:40.672
Will that happen again,

35:40.706 --> 35:42.908
or are emotions running
too high?

35:42.941 --> 35:45.611
One thing is certain-- if the
primaries are any guideline,

35:45.644 --> 35:47.779
this election will be
full of surprises,

35:47.813 --> 35:49.881
and some of them will be ugly.
The burning question is

35:49.915 --> 35:52.551
"What kind of America will it be
when it's all over?"

35:57.323 --> 35:59.291
(birds chirping)

35:59.325 --> 36:01.660

* Well, you might think
I'm crazy *

36:39.598 --> 36:43.502
* To hang around with you

36:43.535 --> 36:46.505
RED: Gareth. Gareth,
where are you, buddy?

36:46.538 --> 36:48.640
Uh, good morning, Senator.

36:48.674 --> 36:50.342
Didn't expect you
for another hour or so.

36:50.376 --> 36:52.311
I'm feeling like a million bucks

36:52.344 --> 36:54.513
this morning.
Oh. (chuckles)

36:54.546 --> 36:56.882
What do we got up first?

36:56.915 --> 36:59.518
The call with Senator
Healy, sir, to set up
the press conference.

36:59.551 --> 37:01.620
Nah, we're not gonna do that.

37:01.653 --> 37:04.490
Senator, I, um...

37:09.428 --> 37:12.398
Do you want me to set up
a meeting instead of the call?

37:12.431 --> 37:13.799
With who?
Senator Healy.

37:13.832 --> 37:15.601
No. We don't need all that.

37:15.634 --> 37:17.836
There was an agreement.

37:17.869 --> 37:19.705
Tell you what,

37:19.738 --> 37:23.008
why don't you call
this number instead.

37:25.043 --> 37:26.878
Is Dr. Daudier here?

37:26.912 --> 37:28.880
I can't seem to get him
on his cell, and he wanted

37:28.914 --> 37:30.782
to check
on something...
We're closed.

37:33.785 --> 37:36.021
What's your name?

37:36.054 --> 37:38.023
Why?

37:38.056 --> 37:40.025
Well, because, Jesse,

37:40.058 --> 37:41.627
I work with Senator Healy,

37:41.660 --> 37:43.562
and he's looking to make
some budget cuts

37:43.595 --> 37:46.632
to the security payroll here,
so unless you want...
Go right ahead.

37:46.665 --> 37:49.000
(whirring)

37:57.943 --> 37:59.445
Could you turn some lights on?

37:59.478 --> 38:01.947
(whirring)

38:11.757 --> 38:13.759
Dr. Daudier?

38:14.793 --> 38:17.496
Hello?

38:29.875 --> 38:32.411
(loud clatter)

38:43.622 --> 38:45.957
Dr. Daudier?

38:52.731 --> 38:55.100
(thud)

38:56.067 --> 38:58.504
Guard. Guard!

38:58.537 --> 38:59.838
(siren wailing)
Go, go, go!
We got a Code 3!

38:59.871 --> 39:01.907
We need
to go, go, go!
They're inside.

39:01.940 --> 39:04.476
They're inside me!
Hold still, sir.

39:04.510 --> 39:06.478
We're gonna start
a line.
(screaming)

39:06.512 --> 39:08.480
Hold him down. Hold him!
Just hold him down.
Check his ears.

39:08.514 --> 39:09.948
He says there's
something in his ears.

39:09.981 --> 39:11.817
Just talk to him, just
calm him down a bit, okay?

39:11.850 --> 39:14.553
My mind. It's going!
It's okay. You're fine.

39:14.586 --> 39:16.121
You're fine. We're
almost there.
It's going! (sobbing)

39:16.154 --> 39:17.823
When is your birthday?
Your birthday, sir.

39:17.856 --> 39:21.092
(sobs)
Oh, God, I can't remember.

39:21.126 --> 39:22.594
It's okay. Just take a breath.
Take a breath.

39:22.628 --> 39:24.830
(shouting)
Can't you do anything?!

39:24.863 --> 39:26.465
Move, move, move!
We have to move! Let's go!
I can't hold him.

39:26.498 --> 39:27.966
Get them out!

39:27.999 --> 39:30.168
Just focus on my fingers.
You're okay.

39:30.201 --> 39:31.703
You're okay.
(cracking)

39:31.737 --> 39:32.303
(gasps)

39:32.337 --> 39:33.605
(flatlining)
(squeaks)

39:40.546 --> 39:42.681
No, no, that's not what
they want. They want power.

39:42.714 --> 39:45.050
They want to grind our
face in this shutdown.

39:45.083 --> 39:46.752
Senator, he's coming.

39:46.785 --> 39:48.153
Good.
Take him in through the kitchen,

39:48.186 --> 39:50.121
and, uh, I'll meet him
in your office.

39:52.458 --> 39:53.659
Sir,

39:53.692 --> 39:56.161
you sure you want
to do this?

39:56.194 --> 40:00.432
Do you like this office, Gareth?

40:00.466 --> 40:03.702
(chuckles)
Not especially.
Do you like having

40:03.735 --> 40:06.438
to go to the Democrats
and beg for every morsel

40:06.472 --> 40:07.706
of legislative clout?
No.

40:07.739 --> 40:11.710
Good. Then show him in
through the kitchen.

40:14.245 --> 40:17.015
This way,
Senator Spitz.

40:18.149 --> 40:19.685
SPITZ:
What are you offering?

40:19.718 --> 40:21.853
Chair on Armed
Services,

40:21.887 --> 40:24.155
ranking member of
Economic Policy.

40:24.189 --> 40:25.691
Not enough.
And...

40:25.724 --> 40:27.826
a $14 million war chest

40:27.859 --> 40:29.027
from the
Republican PAC.
You know

40:29.060 --> 40:31.597
I've been a Democrat
all my life.
I know. But what is

40:31.630 --> 40:34.600
a Democrat these days?
What is a Republican?

40:34.633 --> 40:36.602
A brand.

40:36.635 --> 40:38.604
You ate Cheerios this morning,

40:38.637 --> 40:40.506
you'll eat Wheat Chex tomorrow.

40:43.141 --> 40:46.111
Come on, Senator.

40:46.144 --> 40:48.714
Let's do this.

40:48.747 --> 40:51.483
Let's make history.

40:59.758 --> 41:02.060
(phone buzzing)

41:07.032 --> 41:10.001
(sighs)

41:10.035 --> 41:12.838
Hi, Dad.

41:12.871 --> 41:15.173
(indistinct chatter)

41:15.206 --> 41:17.776
MONARCH:
In a stunning betrayal
of his caucus,

41:17.809 --> 41:20.979
Senator Spitz of Maine
crossed the aisle today,

41:21.012 --> 41:24.115
handing the reins of power
to the Republican...

41:24.149 --> 41:26.752
In a bold and historic move
by the Republicans,

41:26.785 --> 41:28.687
the senate changed hands today.

41:28.720 --> 41:31.056
Democrats were left gasping...
Where were you?

41:32.223 --> 41:34.192
Watching a man's head explode.

41:34.225 --> 41:36.194
Very funny.
Your brother is looking for you.

41:36.227 --> 41:38.196
Where is he?
The new offices.

41:38.229 --> 41:39.698
We're in the minority now.

41:39.731 --> 41:40.899
The whip has to
give these up.

41:40.932 --> 41:42.167
Where do we go?

41:55.180 --> 41:57.616
I'm so sorry, Luke.

41:57.649 --> 42:00.619
Why? This is great.

42:00.652 --> 42:02.854
Have some dog.

42:03.855 --> 42:06.825
Why are you not sad?

42:06.858 --> 42:08.326
Because we're gonna
destroy them.

42:08.359 --> 42:10.028
And you're gonna help me.

42:10.061 --> 42:14.032
You and Scarlett are gonna
help me kick their ass.

42:14.065 --> 42:15.734
Starting today.

42:20.672 --> 42:22.841
Tell me what to do.

42:22.874 --> 42:26.111
(chuckles)
(phone buzzes)

42:26.144 --> 42:28.113
Uh, yeah.

42:28.146 --> 42:31.549
(The Cars' "You Might Think"
playing)

42:46.865 --> 42:48.600
And as if this year
weren't dramatic enough,

42:48.634 --> 42:50.969
the senate has changed hands

42:51.002 --> 42:52.704
in the midst
of a presidential fight

42:52.738 --> 42:54.272
for the future of this country.

42:54.305 --> 42:56.708
Well, how do we unpack all this?

42:56.742 --> 42:59.711
Number one,
bipartisanship is dead.

42:59.745 --> 43:01.279
Number two...
