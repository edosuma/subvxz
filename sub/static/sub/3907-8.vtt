Powered through some dark days.

20:08.625 --> 20:12.117
And I've forged a new path
towards the company's future.

20:12.504 --> 20:15.462
The problem is, the head honChO
doesn't seem to appreciate that.

20:15.757 --> 20:17.918
I'd prefer to be somewhere he does.

20:18.009 --> 20:20.466
I'd feel the same way
if the Giants didn't Show me the love.

20:20.804 --> 20:24.296
-SO, if I left Anderson...
-Hypothetically.

20:24.391 --> 20:25.506
Hypothetically.

20:27.727 --> 20:28.967
Would you stick with me?

20:30.980 --> 20:34.689
ls Spencer Strasmore a part
Of this hypothetical situation?

20:35.902 --> 20:37.187
I can't say for sure.

20:37.612 --> 20:39.113
Listen, Joe. I like you, man.

20:39.197 --> 20:41.939
You're a good dude.
You've already made me a whole lot Of paper.

20:44.327 --> 20:45.942
-I'd rock with you.
-Yesl

VICTOR: There's just one last thing, though.

20:49.416 --> 20:50.496
Yeah. What? Anything.

20:50.583 --> 20:54.075
Just something to make sure
that you're committed to me long-term.

20:54.170 --> 20:55.706
Absolutely, absolutely.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.558
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

21:19.696 --> 21:21.687
Look, Bella, I'm sorry I lost my head, Okay?

21:23.616 --> 21:24.992
I'm sorry for everything.

I keep repeating my mistakes,
but I'm trying to Change.

You like it? LOOk at that.

21:44.512 --> 21:45.672

21:46.848 --> 21:48.509
You really believe you're ready for marriage?

21:51.436 --> 21:54.052
'Cause after all, I mean,
you know this is an engagement ring, right?

21:54.898 --> 21:55.853
Well...

a bullshit apology ring.

21:59.736 --> 22:01.397
-NO, baby, 'Cause this is what...
-NO, you listen to me.

-Thank you, Tommy.

23:02.340 --> 23:04.205
-What do you mean?
-At your big party.

23:04.384 --> 23:06.090
You looked through me
like I wasn't even there.

23:06.511 --> 23:08.797
Angie, come on.
I had a lot going on that night.

23:09.764 --> 23:10.924
Really?

23:11.683 --> 23:13.093
Okay, I'm sorry.

23:13.643 --> 23:15.099
-Is that what you wanted to hear?
-No.

23:15.478 --> 23:18.220
What I wanted was to see your face
when you handed me my money.

23:18.439 --> 23:20.225
And you denied me that,

23:20.316 --> 23:22.523
so I'm taking my product elsewhere.

23:23.861 --> 23:25.988
Angie, you can't do this. Don't do that.

23:26.072 --> 23:27.061
Yeah, I'm doing that.

23:27.156 --> 23:29.283
Look, if this gets out,
Vernon is gonna be ruined.

23:29.450 --> 23:32.442
Oh, poor baby doesn't get
his multimillion-dollar deal with the Cowboys.

23:32.870 --> 23:34.030
BOO-fucking-hoo.

23:34.163 --> 23:35.573
Why are you even dragging him into this?

23:35.873 --> 23:37.659
If you needed money,
why didn't you just come to me?

23:37.834 --> 23:39.620
Don't pretend you care, Spencer.

23:39.711 --> 23:40.826
I'm not one Of your Clients.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.502
I'm just another Chick at the party
you guys pass around for kicks.

23:43.590 --> 23:44.830
When did I ever pass you around?

23:44.924 --> 23:46.130
-You're part Of it.
-Part Of what?

23:46.217 --> 23:48.503
The boys' Club, your little fucking wolf packs.

Whether or not
you Choose to admit it, it's true.

23:53.558 --> 23:55.014
-I treated you right.
-Really?

23:55.101 --> 23:56.181
Yeah, we had good times.

23:56.269 --> 23:57.600
During all those good times,

23:57.687 --> 24:00.053
did we ever have a conversation
beyond how good I look,

24:00.148 --> 24:01.934
if I want another drink,
or where I want to hang out?

24:02.025 --> 24:03.435
We talked about a lot Of stuff.

24:03.776 --> 24:06.609
Yourjob, your modeling.
We talked about your pottery.

24:06.696 --> 24:08.311
I'm a 31-year-old concierge Clerk

24:08.406 --> 24:10.067
who spends her nights shaking her ass at Liv

24:10.158 --> 24:11.898
and her mornings trying to earn a degree,

24:12.327 --> 24:13.783
all while raising a son.

24:14.203 --> 24:15.488
Did you ever know any of those things?

24:15.580 --> 24:16.786
I knew about the Liv thing.

24:18.541 --> 24:19.826
But when did you have a kid?

24:22.211 --> 24:24.167
-Are you scared he's yours?
-Is he?

24:25.465 --> 24:26.921
Is that what this is all about?

24:27.133 --> 24:29.624
(LAUGHS) God, it'd be so easy
tO fuck with you right now

24:29.719 --> 24:30.799
and say that he is.

24:31.512 --> 24:32.592
SO he's not.

24:33.514 --> 24:34.765
You must be relieved.

24:40.104 --> 24:41.935
Angie, look, I'm really sorry

24:43.149 --> 24:44.559
that you feel passed around.

24:45.693 --> 24:48.810
Okay? I'm sorry that you're having a tough
time making ends meet.

24:48.905 --> 24:51.942
And I'm really fucking sorry
that I ditched you the way I did.

24:52.325 --> 24:56.034
I was a fucking asshole and I did a lot
Of shitty things that I'm not proud Of.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.611
But Vernon's a good kid,
and if these pictures get out,

24:58.748 --> 25:00.079
not only is his contract gonna get killed,

25:00.166 --> 25:01.872
but whatever little innocence he has left

25:01.959 --> 25:04.245
is gonna get completely fucking destroyed.

25:05.963 --> 25:09.091
And whatever I gotta
do to protect that, I'll do it.

25:12.762 --> 25:14.252
See? That wasn't so difficult.

25:15.723 --> 25:18.009
Your level of sincerity was pitch-perfect.

25:20.561 --> 25:22.062
