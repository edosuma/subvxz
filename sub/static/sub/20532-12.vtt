00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:09.710 --> 00:12.511
¶ I was a girl in the village
Doing all right ¶

00:12.513 --> 00:14.880
¶ Then I became
A princess overnight ¶

00:14.882 --> 00:17.683
¶ Now I gotta figure out
How to do it right ¶

00:17.685 --> 00:19.718
¶ So much to learn
And see ¶

00:19.720 --> 00:22.554
¶ Up in the castle
With my new family ¶

00:22.556 --> 00:25.290
¶ In a school that's
Just for royalty ¶

00:25.292 --> 00:29.661
¶ A whole enchanted world
Is waiting for me ¶

00:29.663 --> 00:33.065
-¶ I'm so excited to be ¶
-¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:36.237 --> 00:38.170
¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:38.172 --> 00:41.707
¶ Making my way
It's an adventure every day ¶

00:41.709 --> 00:43.575
¶ Sofia ¶

00:43.577 --> 00:45.511
-¶ It's gonna be my time ¶
-¶ Sofia ¶

00:45.513 --> 00:52.117
¶ To show them all
That I'm Sofia the first ¶

00:58.759 --> 01:00.659
[wolf howling]

01:01.729 --> 01:04.163
Griffin wings, check.

01:04.165 --> 01:05.597
Tail, check.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.099
Treat bag, milady?

01:07.101 --> 01:08.734
Check again.

01:08.736 --> 01:10.402
Now I'm ready to go
trick-or-treating.

01:10.404 --> 01:11.904
Did you say
trick-or-treating?!

01:11.906 --> 01:13.705
Calista!
Miss Cordelia!

01:13.707 --> 01:15.607
Hello, Princess Sofia.

01:15.609 --> 01:18.010
I'm heading out to meet
my witch friends
for Halloween.

01:18.012 --> 01:20.012
That sounds
like tons of fun!

01:20.014 --> 01:21.680
Where are you going?

01:21.682 --> 01:23.248
We're on our way out
to a party

01:23.250 --> 01:26.018
at my friend,
Muldo the Magnificent's house.

01:26.020 --> 01:28.554
Great goblin costume,
Calista.

01:28.556 --> 01:31.256
[giggling]
Get it?

01:31.258 --> 01:33.759
I'm the Giggling Goblin
of Dreary Woods.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.594
The famous Halloween
legend!

01:35.596 --> 01:38.397
Legend? I think
the Giggling Goblin's real.

01:38.399 --> 01:41.133
Did you know his giggles
cast magic spells?

01:41.135 --> 01:42.601
-They do?
-Yes.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.603
And he loves candy
so much,

01:44.605 --> 01:47.406
he just giggles and it
flies right out of the
trick-or-treaters' hands

01:47.408 --> 01:49.308
and straight to him!

01:49.310 --> 01:51.110
You sure know
your goblin stuff.

01:51.112 --> 01:52.444
And my ghost stuff.

01:52.446 --> 01:53.779
And my werewolf stuff.

01:53.781 --> 01:56.582
Halloween is my very
most favorite holiday!

01:56.584 --> 01:58.717
Every night
before she goes to bed,

01:58.719 --> 02:01.987
Calista makes me read her
the Ghastly Guide to Halloween.

02:01.989 --> 02:04.623
That's why I wish
I had somewhere fun
to go tonight,

02:04.625 --> 02:07.793
[whispering] instead of
a boring grown-up party.

02:07.795 --> 02:10.496
Well, why don't you
come trick-or-treating
with me and my friends?

02:10.498 --> 02:12.231
Really? I'd love to!

02:12.233 --> 02:14.099
If it's all right
with your mom.

02:14.101 --> 02:16.502
Please, Mummy?
Can I go with Sofia?

02:16.504 --> 02:18.303
Of course, dear.

02:18.305 --> 02:20.005
Oh, you'll
have a great time.

02:20.007 --> 02:21.673
Thank you, Mummy!

02:21.675 --> 02:24.510
This is going to be
the best Halloween ever!

02:24.512 --> 02:26.278
I'll take
good care of Calista.

02:26.280 --> 02:29.181
My parents know
every house I plan
on trick-or-treating at.

02:29.183 --> 02:31.650
Wonderful.
Have a lovely time girls.

02:31.652 --> 02:32.651
We will. Thanks, Mum.
Bye!

02:32.653 --> 02:34.419
[Sofia] Bye!

02:34.421 --> 02:36.488
[whinnying]

02:36.490 --> 02:38.690
Oh! When will we get
to the village?

02:38.692 --> 02:41.093
You're really excited
to trick-or-treat, huh?

02:41.095 --> 02:44.429
I'm excited to do everything
with you and your friends.

02:44.431 --> 02:46.431
I just hope they like me.

02:46.433 --> 02:47.866
I know they will.

02:49.303 --> 02:51.570
[horse whinnies]

02:57.611 --> 02:59.611
She's dressed
as Carol of the Arrow!

02:59.613 --> 03:02.714
[Calista] And looky!
There's a ghost, a cat,

03:02.716 --> 03:06.318
and-- Aah! A really
ghastly monster!

03:06.320 --> 03:08.187
Oh. Those are my witch friends,

03:08.189 --> 03:09.721
Lucinda, Indigo, and Lily.

03:09.723 --> 03:10.722
Sofia!

03:10.724 --> 03:12.791
-Hey!
-Hi!

03:12.793 --> 03:14.860
I love
your griffin costume.

03:14.862 --> 03:15.861
Thanks, Lucinda.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.696
Watch this.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.065
Whoa!
Hello, everybody!

03:20.067 --> 03:22.067
Hey, Sofia,
who's the little ghoul?

03:22.069 --> 03:23.835
Actually, I'm a goblin!

03:23.837 --> 03:26.138
The Giggling Goblin
of Dreary Woods.

03:26.140 --> 03:28.240
[giggles] See?

03:28.242 --> 03:30.142
This is Mr. Cedric's
niece, Calista.

03:30.144 --> 03:32.177
I invited her to
trick-or-treat with us.

03:32.179 --> 03:35.881
And I'm so very excited
to spend Halloween
with you all!

03:35.883 --> 03:38.483
[whispering] Don't you think
she's too little
to come with us?

03:38.485 --> 03:39.885
I am not!

03:39.887 --> 03:41.720
My mummy says
I'm tall for my age.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.756
What Indigo's saying
is that Halloween

03:44.758 --> 03:48.093
is a super, super special night
for us witches.

03:48.095 --> 03:52.497
And we want to cram
in as many thrills
and chills as possible.

03:52.499 --> 03:54.866
You'll get scared
or walk too slow
and hold us back

03:54.868 --> 03:55.901
from all the spooky fun.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.502
I won't get scared!

03:57.504 --> 03:58.904
And I'll walk
just as fast as you.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.672
I promise.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.941
I also know loads
about Halloween.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.743
I can tell you all
about the Mummy Knight

04:04.745 --> 04:07.112
or the Zombie
of Zoodrury Lane.

04:07.114 --> 04:10.616
Calista reads
the Ghastly Guide
to Halloween every night.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.184
I really do!

04:12.186 --> 04:14.886
I'll be very handy
when it comes to spooking.

04:14.888 --> 04:16.622
I'll prove it!

04:16.624 --> 04:20.025
[jazzy music playing]

04:21.929 --> 04:24.429
[moaning and laughing]

04:26.400 --> 04:30.102
¶ Won't you let me spend
This super spooky night ¶

04:30.104 --> 04:31.203
¶ Palling 'round
With your witch crowd ¶

04:31.205 --> 04:32.904
¶ Witch crowd ¶

04:32.906 --> 04:35.607
¶ I'm an expert
On every kind of fright ¶

04:35.609 --> 04:38.310
¶ I promise
I'll haunt you proud ¶

04:38.312 --> 04:39.645
¶ Do-doot ¶

04:39.647 --> 04:41.446
Well...

04:41.448 --> 04:42.648
¶ Do-doot ¶

04:42.650 --> 04:43.949
¶ You say you're a whiz ¶

04:43.951 --> 04:45.817
¶ But did you know this? ¶

04:45.819 --> 04:48.153
¶ When we trick-or-treat
We spook with a twist ¶

04:48.155 --> 04:51.156
[Calista] ¶ Knock and
When someone opens the door ¶

04:51.158 --> 04:52.824
¶ Scare 'em like they've
Never been scared before ¶

04:52.826 --> 04:54.459
Aah!

04:54.461 --> 04:56.628
-Then you get a treat!
-She's right!

04:56.630 --> 04:59.631
¶ But what if your haunt
Is a great big fail? ¶

04:59.633 --> 05:04.002
¶ Then you get a trick like
Something stinky or stale ¶

05:04.004 --> 05:07.839
¶ We should let her spend
This super spooky night ¶

05:07.841 --> 05:09.975
¶ Palling 'round
With this witch crowd ¶

05:09.977 --> 05:11.643
¶ She can pitch in ¶

05:11.645 --> 05:13.245
¶ And help us
With the frights ¶

05:13.247 --> 05:17.749
¶ I promise
She'll haunt us proud ¶

05:17.751 --> 05:20.519
¶ But now who decides
On a trick or a prize? ¶

05:20.521 --> 05:23.322
¶ Did you know the pumpkins
Rate your tries? ¶

05:23.324 --> 05:26.124
[Calista] ¶ Scare-o-meters
Measure the frights ¶

05:26.126 --> 05:31.496
¶ If you caused chills
The needle moves to the right ¶

05:33.300 --> 05:36.935
¶ Won't you let me
Spend this super spooky night ¶

05:36.937 --> 05:39.438
¶ Palling 'round
With your witch crowd ¶

05:39.440 --> 05:41.373
¶ I can pitch in and help you ¶

05:41.375 --> 05:42.874
-¶ With the frights ¶
-Ha ha! Boo!

05:42.876 --> 05:45.010
¶ I promise
I'll haunt you proud ¶

05:45.012 --> 05:47.846
¶ She promises
To haunt you proud ¶

05:47.848 --> 05:51.650
¶ She promises to haunt
You proud ¶

05:51.652 --> 05:54.953
¶ Gonna haunt you proud ¶

05:56.690 --> 05:59.858
So, can I spend Halloween
with you all tonight?

05:59.860 --> 06:01.126
Can I?

06:01.128 --> 06:03.295
Oh, I think
she should stay.

06:03.297 --> 06:06.331
Me, too.
She's so sweet.

06:06.333 --> 06:07.699
Indigo?

06:07.701 --> 06:09.968
All right, fine.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.903
I promise not
to ruin your night.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.972
I pinky promise it!

06:13.974 --> 06:16.141
Great! Then let's
start trick-or-treating.

06:16.143 --> 06:18.443
[snapping]

06:33.394 --> 06:35.494
First stop of the night:

06:35.496 --> 06:37.329
the great Merlin's tower!

06:37.331 --> 06:40.265
Ooh, fun, fun,
funny fun fun!

06:40.267 --> 06:42.934
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
we got it after one "fun."

06:48.108 --> 06:50.509
Let's be sure to be spooky
so we get treats.

06:50.511 --> 06:51.743
I will!

06:51.745 --> 06:53.645
[giggling]

06:55.949 --> 07:01.119
Sofia, should we tell
Calista that her giggle
is more cutie than creepy?

07:01.121 --> 07:03.121
Um, it might
make her nervous.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.592
[knocking]

07:07.594 --> 07:11.496
Greetings,
trick-or-treaters.

07:12.366 --> 07:13.432
Boo!

07:15.936 --> 07:19.237
Oh, what a fine fright!

07:19.239 --> 07:20.872
[bells dinging]

07:20.874 --> 07:23.742
And my scare-o-meter agrees!

07:23.744 --> 07:26.812
Booo-ooo!

07:26.814 --> 07:32.217
I am the ghost
of Halloween Eve!

07:32.219 --> 07:33.885
[bells dinging]

07:33.887 --> 07:37.122
Oh, dearie!
A delightful scare!

07:37.124 --> 07:39.791
-[screeching]
-[moaning]

07:39.793 --> 07:43.762
I'm shaking
in my wizard boots!

07:43.764 --> 07:46.298
-[bells dinging]
-[chuckling]

07:46.300 --> 07:49.134
Mighty fine frights,
girls.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.803
And so
treats for you all!

07:51.805 --> 07:54.172
Thanks, Mr. Merlin!

07:54.174 --> 07:55.407
My candy!

07:55.409 --> 07:57.175
[candy squeaking like bat]

08:02.649 --> 08:04.149
My turn to spook.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.851
I want a bat candy, too.

08:05.853 --> 08:07.986
[giggling]

08:09.022 --> 08:10.755
[ding]

08:10.757 --> 08:13.458
[chuckling]
Aren't you adorable?

08:13.460 --> 08:16.094
No, I'm really scary!

08:16.096 --> 08:17.629
[giggling]

08:17.631 --> 08:19.998
Nope, still cute
as a button.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.434
So, since
you did not scare me,

08:22.436 --> 08:24.669
I must give you a trick.

08:24.671 --> 08:28.006
Tremendously tart
lemon sours!

08:28.008 --> 08:31.877
A fun little trick
for fun little you.

08:33.146 --> 08:35.947
Goodbye, girls.
Happy spooking!

08:36.884 --> 08:38.817
[candy squeaking]

08:38.819 --> 08:40.685
Sorry you didn't get
a treat, Calista.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.654
-Want one of mine?
-It's okay.

08:42.656 --> 08:44.689
But don't tell
the other girls
I got a trick.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.825
But we've all
gotten tricks before.

08:46.827 --> 08:49.194
Aw, Calista,
did you get a trick?

08:49.196 --> 08:50.996
What? No, I didn't.

08:50.998 --> 08:52.797
I got candy just like you.

08:52.799 --> 08:54.866
Lemon treats! See?

08:59.706 --> 09:01.907
[gasps]
She can't talk!

09:01.909 --> 09:03.208
And she's turning yellow!

09:03.210 --> 09:05.143
Calista, spit it out!

09:06.079 --> 09:08.146
[spits] Oh, yucky!

09:08.148 --> 09:10.148
So, you did get a trick.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.083
Don't worry.

09:12.085 --> 09:14.052
I wasn't great
at spooking either
when I was your age.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.588
We'll just try again
at the next house,
that's all.

09:16.590 --> 09:18.924
Right! I just thought
of a great spook

09:18.926 --> 09:22.260
that'll show
your friends I can scare
just as well as they can.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.704
This is
Professor Peculian's house.

09:32.706 --> 09:35.106
Oh, I really
hope we scare Mr. P.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.575
Me, too.

09:36.577 --> 09:39.244
He's famous for handing out
the best candy

09:39.246 --> 09:43.281
to anyone who gives him
a really big scaaare.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.916
And that will be me.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.284
Just you wait.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.719
You'll see
how spooky I can be.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.087
[knocking]

09:49.089 --> 09:53.191
Well, hello,
Halloween visitors.

09:53.193 --> 09:56.761
What trick will you
treat me with tonight?

09:56.763 --> 09:59.064
Caw caw!

09:59.066 --> 10:00.098
Meow!

10:00.100 --> 10:02.634
-Boo!
-Ahhhh!

10:02.636 --> 10:04.069
Oh! Shivers!

10:04.071 --> 10:06.271
Up and down my spine!

10:06.273 --> 10:09.040
[bells dinging]

10:13.280 --> 10:15.113
Raarrr!

10:15.115 --> 10:17.549
How delightfully
daunting!

10:17.551 --> 10:19.451
[bells dinging]

10:19.453 --> 10:20.752
We did it!

10:20.754 --> 10:23.655
We all scared him!
Especially me!

10:23.657 --> 10:25.323
Yes indeed.

10:25.325 --> 10:26.925
You were
not excessively eerie,

10:26.927 --> 10:29.327
but sufficiently spooky,
so...

10:29.329 --> 10:32.263
a sufficient-sized treat
for all of you.

10:32.265 --> 10:33.431
Pumpkin pops!

10:33.433 --> 10:34.633
Thank you!

10:34.635 --> 10:35.834
Enjoy!

10:35.836 --> 10:37.168
That dragon costume

10:37.170 --> 10:39.904
was a fantabulous idea,
Calista.

10:39.906 --> 10:42.273
It was a great scare,
wasn't it?

10:42.275 --> 10:44.509
Oh! Look!
They light up!

10:49.149 --> 10:51.249
I'm having the best time!

10:51.251 --> 10:54.085
I'm so happy,
I could just-- Oh!

10:54.087 --> 10:55.320
-Watch out!
-Oh, no!

10:56.590 --> 10:57.689
Sorry!

10:57.691 --> 10:59.924
My pumpkin is toast.

10:59.926 --> 11:02.193
Maybe they taste
better crunchy?

11:02.195 --> 11:03.495
I doubt it, Sofia.

11:03.497 --> 11:05.196
This mess
is all thanks to you.

11:05.198 --> 11:06.798
I'm really sorry!

11:06.800 --> 11:08.433
I forgot about my fire.

11:08.435 --> 11:09.634
It's okay.

11:09.636 --> 11:11.036
Everyone makes mistakes.

11:11.038 --> 11:12.037
Right?

11:12.039 --> 11:13.438
Not as many as she does.

11:13.440 --> 11:16.041
Haven't you had
enough Halloween, Calista.

11:16.043 --> 11:17.375
What? No!

11:17.377 --> 11:18.443
I want
to do lots more!

11:18.445 --> 11:20.045
Good!

11:20.047 --> 11:22.013
Because it's time
for the corn maze dash

11:22.015 --> 11:23.348
-at Lucinda's house.
-Oh!

11:23.350 --> 11:25.650
And we are all going
to have a great time.

11:25.652 --> 11:27.352
Come on, everyone.

11:27.354 --> 11:28.720
[snapping]

11:30.390 --> 11:32.057
No more flames, got it?

11:32.059 --> 11:34.359
Got it. I won't mess
anything else up.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.261
Redressio.

11:37.564 --> 11:39.698
I pinky promise it.

11:45.305 --> 11:46.705
There's my mom!

11:46.707 --> 11:48.606
[cackling]

11:51.378 --> 11:54.813
You don't look too excited
for the corn maze dash.

11:54.815 --> 11:58.383
I need to show your friends
I'm not some silly kid
who messes things up.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.685
Calista, you don't have
to prove anything.

12:00.687 --> 12:02.353
Just be yourself.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.089
Hello, girls.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.591
Are you little witchlets
having a good night?

12:06.593 --> 12:07.859
Yeah.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.394
Sort of.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.763
But it's
only going to get better.

12:11.765 --> 12:13.364
Bat-tastic.

12:13.366 --> 12:15.433
Ooh! More visitors!

12:15.435 --> 12:19.437
Welcome, witch-a-dees,
to the corn maze dash.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.039
The maze starts here,

12:21.041 --> 12:22.574
Dash through,

12:22.576 --> 12:25.243
and the first team to reach
the end gets the prize.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.377
Gummy ghouls!

12:26.379 --> 12:28.446
Gummy ghouls
are my favorite!

12:28.448 --> 12:30.415
Mine, too.
So don't goof it up.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.850
I won't.

12:31.852 --> 12:33.885
In fact, I want to lead
you all through the maze.

12:33.887 --> 12:35.787
You want us to follow you?

12:35.789 --> 12:38.356
I feel awful I burnt
your pumpkin treats,

12:38.358 --> 12:41.259
so I want to make sure
you all get gummy ghouls.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.228
But what
if you get us lost?

12:43.230 --> 12:47.599
I've read the chapter
on corn mazes 16 times,

12:47.601 --> 12:50.068
so that makes me
a corn maze expert.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.403
16 is a lot of times.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.873
And I really want
those gummy ghouls.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.374
[sighs]
All right, Calista.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.276
-Lead the way.
-[snap]

13:00.480 --> 13:01.913
I hope you know
what you're doing.

13:01.915 --> 13:04.649
Remember, you don't
have to try so hard.

13:04.651 --> 13:06.084
Yes, I do!

13:06.086 --> 13:09.387
All right,
you little charmers,

13:09.389 --> 13:12.423
on your mark,
get set,

13:12.425 --> 13:14.058
-dash!
-[bell rings]

13:18.431 --> 13:19.564
Follow me, everyone!

13:19.566 --> 13:21.132
The secret to beating
this maze

13:21.134 --> 13:22.734
is to keep going left.

13:22.736 --> 13:23.802
Go left!

13:24.738 --> 13:25.804
Go left again!

13:26.740 --> 13:28.173
You're fast, Calista!

13:28.175 --> 13:31.142
[gasps] Stop! Stop!

13:31.144 --> 13:33.278
-Aah!
-Whoa!

13:33.280 --> 13:34.913
Watch out! Unh!

13:39.352 --> 13:41.085
[snaps]

13:41.087 --> 13:42.787
Oh, sorry!
According to the book,

13:42.789 --> 13:44.656
there shouldn't be
a dead end here.

13:44.658 --> 13:46.090
That's
a Full Moon maze.

13:46.092 --> 13:47.292
My mom always builds

13:47.294 --> 13:49.093
a Crescent maze,
like this one.

13:49.095 --> 13:50.094
See?

13:50.096 --> 13:52.030
Um, yes, I knew that.

13:52.032 --> 13:53.698
Go right, everyone!

13:53.700 --> 13:55.767
Calista, if you're
not sure of the way,

13:55.769 --> 13:57.302
just let
someone else lead.

13:57.304 --> 14:00.271
No, Sofia, I have to get
the girls their treats!

14:00.273 --> 14:02.006
Follow me, everyone!

14:02.943 --> 14:04.108
Go right!

14:05.045 --> 14:06.411
Another right!

14:09.282 --> 14:12.050
[Lucinda] Ugh!
This is where we started!

14:12.052 --> 14:15.386
The other witches are probably
close to the end by now.

14:15.388 --> 14:18.056
Uh... then let's
go back in again!

14:18.058 --> 14:19.224
[witch] Made it!

14:19.226 --> 14:20.458
First to the gummy ghouls!

14:20.460 --> 14:21.459
-Whoo-hoo!
-Yeah!

14:21.461 --> 14:23.494
-We rule!
-Yes!

14:23.496 --> 14:26.464
Oh, no, they beat us.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.700
So long, gummy ghouls.

14:28.702 --> 14:32.570
We never should've put
Calista in charge.

14:32.572 --> 14:35.006
I'm sorry.
I got turned around.

14:35.008 --> 14:36.908
-It's not that big a deal.
-[snapping]

14:38.044 --> 14:39.410
Yes, it is, Sofia.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.145
All we have to show
for Halloween so far

14:41.147 --> 14:42.814
is a couple of bat candies.

14:42.816 --> 14:45.049
Indigo, what are you doing?

14:45.051 --> 14:47.518
It's past
this kid's bedtime.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.721
I wave this wand
with force and might

14:49.723 --> 14:53.358
to send this girl home
for the night!

14:53.360 --> 14:54.425
Whoa!

14:54.427 --> 14:56.427
Undo that hex, Indigo!

14:56.429 --> 14:58.696
No way.
She was ruining Halloween!

14:58.698 --> 15:01.699
She sort of
really, really was.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.201
Oh-oh-ohh!

15:03.203 --> 15:04.702
Come on, guys,

15:04.704 --> 15:06.604
you remember what
it was like to be her age

15:06.606 --> 15:09.440
and how bad it felt to be
left out by the big kids.

15:09.442 --> 15:11.109
It did feel pretty bad.

15:11.111 --> 15:13.544
We can't do this to her.

15:13.546 --> 15:16.014
Powers that be,
hear this sound,

15:16.016 --> 15:18.750
turn that girl right around!

15:21.421 --> 15:23.087
Oh, no, you don't!

15:23.089 --> 15:24.422
Ohh!

15:24.424 --> 15:26.224
But remember
how great it was

15:26.226 --> 15:27.625
when the big kids
included you?

15:27.627 --> 15:30.895
Yeah. I was
always so so excited

15:30.897 --> 15:34.465
to play broom tag
with my big sister
and her friends.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.701
You have to give her
one more chance.

15:36.703 --> 15:37.769
Please?

15:37.771 --> 15:39.404
[sighs]

15:39.406 --> 15:40.605
Oh, okay.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.273
But only one.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.610
Oh! Whoa!

15:45.612 --> 15:47.445
Oh! Ohh!

15:47.447 --> 15:49.781
Aah! Ohh!

15:49.783 --> 15:52.050
Thanks
for bringing me back.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.584
The witches are sorry
they sent you away.

15:53.586 --> 15:54.585
Right?

15:54.587 --> 15:55.653
Uh-huh.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.655
-I guess.
-We are.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.057
I'm sorry about the maze.

15:59.059 --> 16:02.660
I promise not to mess up
any more Halloween fun.

16:04.998 --> 16:08.066
It's time
for the haunted hay ride!

16:08.068 --> 16:09.667
There's no driver!

16:09.669 --> 16:12.570
Here I am!
Cheerio, Princess!

16:12.572 --> 16:13.905
-Whoa!
-Dax!

16:13.907 --> 16:15.673
Dax lives
in my castle's attic.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.642
Scared you, didn't I?
[chuckles]

16:17.644 --> 16:21.079
I believe I'm getting better
at this whole ghost business.

16:21.081 --> 16:27.618
Now it's time for an eerie ride
past the Dreary Woods.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.287
Climb aboard
one at a time, please.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.489
Thanks ever so much.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.524
Let's go!

16:33.526 --> 16:35.493
Indeed! Tally-ho!

16:35.495 --> 16:37.061
[horse whinnying]

16:38.365 --> 16:41.132
So how is this
a haunted hay ride?

16:41.134 --> 16:42.934
[laughs] Oh, just wait.

16:42.936 --> 16:45.937
Soon you'll experience
the spirits of the holiday.

16:47.540 --> 16:48.740
[ghosts moaning]

16:51.044 --> 16:52.477
-Aah!
-Oh!

16:52.479 --> 16:54.679
Your friends
look really scared.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.147
They're just fun scared.

16:56.149 --> 16:58.383
-[screams]
-[laughing]

16:58.385 --> 16:59.484
[shouting]

16:59.486 --> 17:00.651
[giggles]

17:00.653 --> 17:02.120
Are you sure?

17:02.122 --> 17:04.155
They look truly
frightened to me.

17:04.157 --> 17:05.523
I'm sure.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.659
-[screams]
-[giggles]

17:08.661 --> 17:10.561
[screams and giggles]

17:10.563 --> 17:12.463
I'll protect you, girls!

17:12.465 --> 17:14.332
Calista, wait,
what are you doing?

17:14.334 --> 17:16.634
There must be a way
to make the ghosts go away.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.469
Uh, here it is!

17:18.471 --> 17:20.438
Stink sockio!

17:21.007 --> 17:22.140
[sniffing]

17:22.142 --> 17:23.574
-Ohh!
-It's foul!

17:23.576 --> 17:25.810
[ghosts exclaiming]

17:25.812 --> 17:27.712
Calista,
don't do that!

17:27.714 --> 17:30.148
But I need to get rid
of these ghosts!

17:30.150 --> 17:31.682
I don't want your Halloween
to be any worse

17:31.684 --> 17:33.751
than I've already made it.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.253
Ghosts hate smelly things,

17:35.255 --> 17:37.722
but what really
scares them is...

17:37.724 --> 17:39.557
-Wait!
-Don't do it!

17:39.559 --> 17:41.759
[Calista] Illuminorit!

17:41.761 --> 17:43.194
[ghosts screaming]

17:43.196 --> 17:44.695
-It's so bright!
-I can't see!

17:44.697 --> 17:45.863
The light! Away!

17:45.865 --> 17:47.031
[moaning] Run!

17:47.033 --> 17:48.733
-It's so bright!
-My eyes!

17:48.735 --> 17:50.535
Dax, don't go!

17:50.537 --> 17:51.702
Ever so sorry!

17:51.704 --> 17:53.604
Take the reins, Princess!

17:53.606 --> 17:56.174
[whinnying]

18:02.048 --> 18:04.549
I can't stop it!

18:04.551 --> 18:05.850
Hold on!

18:05.852 --> 18:07.585
[girls] Whoa!

18:09.422 --> 18:11.022
[whinnying]

18:11.024 --> 18:12.623
Is everyone okay?

18:12.625 --> 18:13.624
-I am.
-Yeah.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.126
I'm fine.

18:15.128 --> 18:17.028
What were you thinking,
Calista?

18:17.030 --> 18:18.863
I'm sorry!
You all looked so scared,

18:18.865 --> 18:21.232
so I tried to drive
the ghosts away,
but ended up...

18:21.234 --> 18:22.700
Ruining
the haunted hay ride?

18:22.702 --> 18:25.603
The way you also ruined
trick-or-treating?

18:25.605 --> 18:27.638
And the corn maze?

18:27.640 --> 18:29.807
This Halloween has
been one big bust,

18:29.809 --> 18:32.076
thanks to you.

18:32.078 --> 18:35.746
I just wanted us to all
have a fun Halloween.

18:35.748 --> 18:37.081
[owl hooting]

18:37.083 --> 18:39.650
I think we're
in the Dreary Woods.

18:39.652 --> 18:42.820
Isn't this where
the Giggling Goblin's
supposed to live?

18:42.822 --> 18:44.088
Yes, it is.

18:44.090 --> 18:45.823
[giggling]

18:45.825 --> 18:48.292
Do you guys hear something?

18:48.294 --> 18:51.496
[giggling]

18:51.498 --> 18:53.231
Hiya, hiya, hiya!

18:53.233 --> 18:54.465
[giggling]

18:54.467 --> 18:57.101
[gasps]
The Giggling Goblin!

18:57.103 --> 18:58.703
-Everyone, let's fly!
-[snaps]

18:59.672 --> 19:00.771
Wait, whoa, whoa!

19:00.773 --> 19:02.807
Was it something I said?
[giggles]

19:02.809 --> 19:04.075
-Hey!
-My broom!

19:04.077 --> 19:05.476
[giggling]

19:05.478 --> 19:07.778
His giggles do
cast magic spells!

19:07.780 --> 19:08.746
Run!

19:08.748 --> 19:10.681
[goblin giggling]

19:11.951 --> 19:13.784
[Sofia] We're trapped!

19:13.786 --> 19:14.652
[giggling]

19:18.158 --> 19:19.524
Ooh, yum yum yum yum!

19:19.526 --> 19:21.192
Halloween's just the best.

19:21.194 --> 19:23.694
So much scrumdiliumptious
candy to steal!

19:23.696 --> 19:24.996
Stay calm, everyone.

19:24.998 --> 19:26.664
Let's try and think
of a way out of here.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.499
What if we used
our wands

19:28.501 --> 19:29.767
and made bats
fly at him?

19:29.769 --> 19:31.202
Then he'd be scared.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.605
[crunching]

19:34.607 --> 19:37.508
[gasps] I just thought
of a way to get us out of here.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.776
Really? What is it?

19:38.778 --> 19:41.679
Oh, forget it.
It's silly.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.114
It'll
just make things worse

19:43.116 --> 19:45.283
like every other idea
I've had tonight.

19:45.285 --> 19:46.817
[Lucinda]
Everyone ready?

19:46.819 --> 19:48.486
-Ready!
-Ready!

19:48.488 --> 19:51.822
Vats and vats
of flying bats!

19:51.824 --> 19:52.823
Huh?

19:52.825 --> 19:54.692
[squeaking]

19:54.694 --> 19:56.627
Frightening flappers?
Fun!

19:56.629 --> 19:58.162
[giggling]

19:58.164 --> 20:00.631
Here, witchy wands.
Come here.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.733
[giggling]

20:04.304 --> 20:07.038
Now what do we do?

20:07.040 --> 20:08.039
[straining]

20:08.041 --> 20:10.708
I can't fit!

20:10.710 --> 20:13.311
Wait.
Calista has an idea.

20:13.313 --> 20:14.879
Go on. Tell us.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.847
No, I don't want to say.

20:16.849 --> 20:19.517
You may be little,
and you may make mistakes.

20:19.519 --> 20:21.886
But you know what?
We all do.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.055
I drove our coach
into the woods, remember?

20:24.057 --> 20:25.756
Well, yes, but--

20:25.758 --> 20:28.693
And the witches
just got their wands
taken away.

20:28.695 --> 20:29.927
[Calista]
I guess that's true.

20:29.929 --> 20:32.563
[Sofia] Big girls can do
a lot of great things,

20:32.565 --> 20:33.931
but so can little girls.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.666
So can you.

20:35.668 --> 20:39.403
Okay, this is
what I was thinking.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.907
Your Giggling Goblin
costume.

20:42.909 --> 20:45.443
Here I go.

20:52.118 --> 20:53.918
Who are you?

20:53.920 --> 20:56.854
I, um...
I'm your biggest fan.

20:56.856 --> 20:59.590
I even dressed
like you for Halloween.

20:59.592 --> 21:00.925
[giggling]

21:00.927 --> 21:02.093
A fan?

21:02.095 --> 21:03.127
No one ever likes me.

21:03.129 --> 21:04.695
Well, I do.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.464
And I know how much
you love candy,

21:06.466 --> 21:08.532
so I got you some.

21:08.534 --> 21:09.967
You got me some candy?

21:09.969 --> 21:11.869
Really?

21:11.871 --> 21:14.405
[gasps]
The lemon sours!

21:14.407 --> 21:16.574
That's actually
a good idea.

21:16.576 --> 21:18.509
Yum, yum, yum!
Thanks a whole bunch!

21:22.815 --> 21:24.282
I can't giggle!

21:28.054 --> 21:30.554
Your wands and brooms!
Hurry!

21:30.556 --> 21:31.656
[swallows] Wait!

21:31.658 --> 21:33.924
Let's get out of here!
Fast!

21:33.926 --> 21:35.259
[pop]

21:35.261 --> 21:36.594
[wails]

21:36.596 --> 21:37.795
You tricked me!

21:37.797 --> 21:39.830
[sobbing]

21:39.832 --> 21:41.065
But you trapped us!

21:41.067 --> 21:43.167
Well, I had to trap you
to get your candy!

21:43.169 --> 21:46.103
It's the only way for me
to ever get yum yum yum treats!

21:46.105 --> 21:47.972
[sobbing]

21:47.974 --> 21:50.107
You could've
just asked.

21:50.109 --> 21:53.411
[sniffling]
And then people will
just give me treats?

21:53.413 --> 21:56.013
That's basically
what happens when you
trick-or-treat.

21:56.015 --> 21:57.815
In fact...

22:00.953 --> 22:02.853
[knocking]

22:04.023 --> 22:06.957
Ah! Second chance spookers!

22:06.959 --> 22:09.026
Back to try a bigger scare,
I see?

22:09.028 --> 22:10.528
-Boo!
-Boo!

22:10.530 --> 22:11.529
-Boo!
-Boo!

22:11.531 --> 22:12.530
Boo!

22:12.532 --> 22:16.000
Mm, more "eh" than "aah!"

22:16.002 --> 22:18.502
What a ghoulishly
great costume.

22:18.504 --> 22:19.503
Costume?

22:19.505 --> 22:21.605
This spook is real!

22:21.607 --> 22:23.507
[giggling]
Hiya, hiya, hiya!

22:23.509 --> 22:25.109
[giggling]

22:25.111 --> 22:29.180
Aah! Terrifically
terrifying!

22:29.182 --> 22:30.281
[bells dinging]

22:31.517 --> 22:33.617
The best scare
of the night!

22:33.619 --> 22:35.019
And so...

22:35.021 --> 22:36.554
Score!

22:39.726 --> 22:43.027
Oh, so much
delicious candy!

22:43.029 --> 22:43.928
[sighs]

22:46.032 --> 22:49.367
Oh, happy day!
[giggling]

22:51.871 --> 22:54.004
Anyone want
my Spooky Swizzle?

22:54.006 --> 22:56.073
-Trade you for
a Moody Marshmallow?
-Deal.

22:56.075 --> 22:59.643
This turned out to be
a really great Halloween.

22:59.645 --> 23:01.512
One of the best.

23:01.514 --> 23:04.014
-Thanks to Calista.
-Me?

23:04.016 --> 23:06.584
You know, I wasn't sure
about you at first,

23:06.586 --> 23:08.886
but I got to admit,

23:08.888 --> 23:10.588
you really showed us
your stuff in the end.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.056
None of us came up
with that idea

23:12.058 --> 23:13.824
to get out
of the goblin trap.

23:13.826 --> 23:15.025
But you did.

23:15.027 --> 23:16.093
You may be little,

23:16.095 --> 23:18.195
but you saved Halloween,
big time.

23:18.197 --> 23:19.563
Thanks, everyone.

23:19.565 --> 23:21.999
Does this mean we're...
friends?

23:22.001 --> 23:23.067
Uh-huh!

23:23.069 --> 23:24.935
Of course, Calista.

23:24.937 --> 23:26.871
You know it, kid.

23:26.873 --> 23:28.105
You'll trick-or-treat
with us next year, right?

23:28.107 --> 23:30.941
Yes! I definitely,
definitely will!

23:30.943 --> 23:33.010
And me, too, right?

23:33.012 --> 23:35.179
Yes, you, too,
Mr. Giggling Goblin.

23:35.181 --> 23:37.014
-Whoa!
-[giggling]

23:39.018 --> 23:40.985
-[jack-'o'lanterns laughing]
-Whoa!
