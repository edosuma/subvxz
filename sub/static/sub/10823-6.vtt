WEBVTT

00:00.857 --> 00:01.944
I'm Caleb Rivers.

00:01.966 --> 00:03.132
I'm still new to Ravenswood,

00:03.134 --> 00:04.334
but here's what I know so far.

00:05.736 --> 00:10.206
In 1917, the Ravenswood town
elders signed a secret pact.

00:10.208 --> 00:11.975
Since then, no soldier from Ravenswood

00:11.977 --> 00:13.709
has ever died in active combat.

00:15.745 --> 00:17.913
Everyone else in my unit is gone.

00:17.915 --> 00:20.149
The price for this ongoing miracle?

00:20.151 --> 00:22.251
Five teens must die.

00:22.253 --> 00:23.119
Five per war.

00:27.457 --> 00:28.624
At least that's how it worked

00:28.626 --> 00:30.793
until Miranda and I came to Ravenswood.

00:30.795 --> 00:33.095
Look out!

00:35.867 --> 00:38.868
The good news? Four of us survived.

00:38.870 --> 00:41.003
The bad? Miranda didn't make it.

00:44.440 --> 00:46.274
Now she's stuck here, a ghost,

00:46.276 --> 00:47.442
and has no way to move on.

00:47.444 --> 00:48.643
The only ones who can see her

00:48.645 --> 00:50.112
are still targets of the curse...

00:50.114 --> 00:51.480
Remy, Luke,

00:51.482 --> 00:53.882
his sister Olivia, and me.

00:55.618 --> 00:57.084
Something or someone

00:57.086 --> 01:00.454
is determined to make
our lives a living hell

01:00.456 --> 01:02.017
and will not stop until we are all dead.

01:05.027 --> 01:07.562
The first to be targeted
were our ancestors.

01:07.564 --> 01:09.430
The original Caleb and original Miranda

01:09.432 --> 01:10.865
were killed in a boating accident.

01:10.867 --> 01:12.366
With three of their friends.

01:12.368 --> 01:14.768
Leave here while you still can.

01:14.770 --> 01:16.537
Miranda found out what
was keeping her trapped

01:16.539 --> 01:17.838
at the Collins' mansion:

01:17.840 --> 01:20.374
one jar, one lock of hair

01:20.376 --> 01:22.676
for every victim of the curse.

01:22.678 --> 01:24.645
He doesn't want to come
near me when I'm alive

01:24.647 --> 01:26.527
but thinks he can keep
some of me when I'm dead?

01:28.483 --> 01:31.084
Miranda was the first to ever break free.

01:31.086 --> 01:33.219
Where is she now? What did you do with her?

01:33.221 --> 01:34.741
But getting out was just the beginning.

01:36.457 --> 01:37.724
Is this heaven?

01:37.726 --> 01:39.259
Max likes to play hide and seek.

01:39.261 --> 01:40.326
We don't know how she got here,

01:40.328 --> 01:41.595
but we're taking care of her.

01:41.597 --> 01:43.964
Miranda thinks she's safe, but she isn't.

01:43.966 --> 01:46.266
She's waiting for you... in hell.

01:46.268 --> 01:48.468
For me, trying to save
Miranda was nearly the end.

01:50.271 --> 01:51.637
The end, as in dead.

01:51.639 --> 01:53.706
Caleb?

01:53.708 --> 01:55.075
I can feel you.

01:55.077 --> 01:56.943
It feels right being here with you.

01:56.945 --> 01:58.445
It's not right here.

01:58.447 --> 02:00.380
We have a heartbeat.

02:00.382 --> 02:01.914
You've been sleepwalking since the accident

02:01.916 --> 02:03.282
and you didn't think
you should tell me this?

02:03.284 --> 02:05.250
Now he's blowing Don off for killing Remy.

02:05.252 --> 02:07.352
I'm not blowing him
off. I'm protecting him.

02:07.354 --> 02:10.089
We still don't know who
or what we're up against.

02:10.091 --> 02:11.356
You want to play?

02:11.358 --> 02:13.626
After all we did, how did this happen?

02:13.628 --> 02:15.595
But there might be someone who can help.

02:17.197 --> 02:19.264
Don't think about him.

02:19.266 --> 02:21.266
Guys, there's stuff in
here about the curse.

02:21.268 --> 02:23.469
Someone from the town's past.

02:23.471 --> 02:24.869
Their names were Thomas and Esther.

02:24.871 --> 02:26.505
They thought if they sacrificed themselves

02:26.507 --> 02:28.107
they could bring Caleb and Miranda back.

02:28.109 --> 02:30.109
And that Caleb and Miranda
could reverse the curse.

03:12.684 --> 03:14.652
Do you hear that?

03:14.654 --> 03:15.886
Hear what?

03:18.289 --> 03:19.389
Listen.

03:24.996 --> 03:26.463
Come on.

03:35.706 --> 03:37.174
What?

03:37.176 --> 03:39.809
That's my father's automobile.

03:39.811 --> 03:41.511
Henry has got ours.

03:41.513 --> 03:42.753
Isn't that your family's horse?

04:19.415 --> 04:21.482
You'll find the words on page 36.

04:22.618 --> 04:23.618
This isn't right.

04:23.620 --> 04:24.953
Sit down, Esther.

04:24.955 --> 04:26.521
You shouldn't even be here.

04:26.523 --> 04:27.889
This is man's business.

04:27.891 --> 04:28.890
It's about the children.

04:28.892 --> 04:29.991
Mother.

04:29.993 --> 04:31.526
And that makes it woman's business.

04:31.528 --> 04:34.128
A mother's heart is a tender thing.

04:34.130 --> 04:36.030
These good men are trying to spare

04:36.032 --> 04:39.066
every mother in this town.

04:39.068 --> 04:41.436
War is a beast, yes.

04:41.438 --> 04:42.318
It consumes the young.

04:44.206 --> 04:46.774
I offer a shield

04:46.776 --> 04:48.408
for the children of the righteous.

04:48.410 --> 04:51.245
Trading lives? Making pacts?

04:51.247 --> 04:52.579
That's not God's way.

04:52.581 --> 04:54.749
Oh? You speak for God?

04:54.751 --> 04:56.350
I speak for the children.

04:56.352 --> 04:58.352
It's your vow but they'll
be the ones to pay.

04:58.354 --> 04:59.620
The men decide what's best

04:59.622 --> 05:01.255
for the women and the children.

05:01.257 --> 05:03.390
That's the way it's in the Bible.

05:03.392 --> 05:04.391
Right, Reverend?

05:04.393 --> 05:06.226
From Genesis to Revelation.

05:09.697 --> 05:11.931
Thomas Rivers, you know this is wrong.

05:11.933 --> 05:14.601
Esther, you know what's
happening over there.

05:14.603 --> 05:15.935
It's a slaughter.

05:15.937 --> 05:18.905
Now the boys in this town
are heading right into it.

05:18.907 --> 05:21.040
Ravenswood has suffered enough.

05:21.042 --> 05:22.776
We need to sign this pact.

05:22.778 --> 05:24.343
For the good of us all.

05:24.345 --> 05:25.979
We've all had so much war, sister.

05:25.981 --> 05:27.280
As I was saying,

05:27.282 --> 05:28.915
you'll find the words on page 36...

05:41.762 --> 05:44.196
Foolish men trying to save the children

05:44.198 --> 05:46.632
from the war that other men started.

05:46.634 --> 05:48.401
Had I know Caleb and Miranda were there,

05:48.403 --> 05:51.003
I would have gathered
them up and left town.

05:51.005 --> 05:54.239
I will set this right... somehow.

05:54.241 --> 05:56.275
Is she talking about the
night the pact was made?

05:56.277 --> 05:57.342
I think so.

05:57.344 --> 06:00.378
So you were there? The other you?

06:00.380 --> 06:03.348
That other guy is just my ancestor.

06:03.350 --> 06:05.583
And Esther was the mother
of the original Miranda,

06:05.585 --> 06:07.585
and the man we found and eloped with her

06:07.587 --> 06:09.587
was original Caleb's father,

06:09.589 --> 06:11.222
Thomas Rivers.

06:11.224 --> 06:14.326
But they were on opposite
sides of the pact.

06:14.328 --> 06:17.329
How did they end up down there together?

06:17.331 --> 06:18.452
Let me see Esther's journal.

06:21.701 --> 06:24.502
That's as far as we got
while you were in Ravenswood.

06:24.504 --> 06:25.970
This preacher must have offered

06:25.972 --> 06:27.738
the town elders some sort of deal.

06:27.740 --> 06:29.073
Maybe they knew what it
was, maybe they didn't,

06:29.075 --> 06:31.275
but it ended up protecting
the soldiers of the town.

06:31.277 --> 06:32.576
Like it did my mom.

06:32.578 --> 06:34.645
All it cost was five innocent lives.

06:34.647 --> 06:36.113
Five per war.

06:36.115 --> 06:38.115
Not quite.

06:38.117 --> 06:40.517
Four of you are still alive.

06:42.321 --> 06:43.561
We're going to keep it that way.

06:45.357 --> 06:46.757
There's something else.

06:48.059 --> 06:49.226
What?

06:49.228 --> 06:51.628
I'm back on a short leash.

06:51.630 --> 06:52.763
What do you mean?

06:52.765 --> 06:54.531
I can't leave the grounds.

06:54.533 --> 06:56.233
After you left I was back here.

06:56.235 --> 06:57.668
We think it has to do with those jars.

06:57.670 --> 07:00.136
Someone was digging around
Miranda's gravestone...

07:00.138 --> 07:01.404
maybe Collins dug her up,

07:01.406 --> 07:03.773
put another lock of her
hair in one of those jars.

07:03.775 --> 07:05.175
If you leave town for three days

07:05.177 --> 07:06.776
you're going to miss some stuff.

07:06.778 --> 07:08.311
So Collins knows what happened.

07:08.313 --> 07:10.213
That Miranda was able to leave.

07:11.949 --> 07:14.817
Guess you're stuck with me.

07:14.819 --> 07:16.919
We're going to find out
who this preacher was...

07:16.921 --> 07:18.320
what he had to gain from this curse

07:18.322 --> 07:19.756
and how he had the power to enforce it.

07:19.758 --> 07:21.391
Maybe we can reverse engineer the pact,

07:21.393 --> 07:23.760
break it, and the curse.

07:23.762 --> 07:25.862
Does she mention a name at all?

07:26.997 --> 07:28.097
It's right there.

07:30.734 --> 07:33.769
Don't know if I'm saying this right...

07:33.771 --> 07:35.437
Gabriel Abaddon.

07:49.286 --> 07:51.185
Think you said it right.

07:51.187 --> 07:55.876
Is there anything left?

08:00.102 --> 08:05.210
<font color="#40bfff">Sync by </font><font color="#FFA500">wilson0804</font> / <font color="#40bfff">Corrections by chamallow</font>
<font color="#40bfff">www.addic7ed.com</font>

08:08.171 --> 08:09.237
Ashes and soot.

08:10.539 --> 08:11.620
Wait, I've found something.

08:13.208 --> 08:14.809
Esther said the men had prayer books.

08:14.811 --> 08:16.444
She mentioned page 36.

08:16.446 --> 08:19.447
It looks like a verse
from a hymnal or a Bible.

08:19.449 --> 08:21.316
Must have been important
enough for her to save.

08:21.318 --> 08:23.216
We need to find out
everything we can about Gabe...

08:23.218 --> 08:24.217
- Whoa, whoa!
- Not again.

08:24.219 --> 08:26.053
Whoa, whoa.

08:26.055 --> 08:28.522
Okay, fine.

08:28.524 --> 08:31.358
We need to find out everything
we can about the preacher.

08:31.360 --> 08:32.827
Well, if he was local, then there might be

08:32.828 --> 08:33.828
something in the Gazette.

08:33.830 --> 08:35.162
Wait a sec.

08:35.164 --> 08:36.530
What is this?

08:39.700 --> 08:40.732
It's a cameo.

08:43.304 --> 08:45.405
Wait. It's a locket.

08:57.451 --> 08:58.718
I don't know what's creeping me out more...

08:58.720 --> 09:00.019
the baby in the locket

09:00.021 --> 09:02.388
or the thought of Collins
digging up Miranda's grave.

09:05.125 --> 09:06.425
Mom? Is that you?

09:12.232 --> 09:15.801
Your mother is not here right now.

09:15.803 --> 09:17.069
Shopping for groceries.

09:20.040 --> 09:20.973
Mr. Collins?

09:23.343 --> 09:24.676
What are you doing here?

09:24.678 --> 09:27.446
I brought this for your mother.

09:27.448 --> 09:29.147
She always liked orchids.

09:29.149 --> 09:30.415
And you thought you'd just break in

09:30.417 --> 09:32.417
and show it to her?

09:32.419 --> 09:33.986
I was going to leave them on the porch

09:33.988 --> 09:35.888
but I wasn't sure about the weather,

09:35.890 --> 09:37.923
so I used the key.

09:37.925 --> 09:39.725
You have keys?

09:39.727 --> 09:40.993
I called your mother.

09:40.995 --> 09:43.629
She told me where she keeps the spare.

09:43.631 --> 09:46.998
I was uneasy about using
it, but she insisted.

09:49.168 --> 09:52.370
If there is anything I can
do for the two of you...

09:54.606 --> 09:57.409
please let me know.

09:57.411 --> 09:58.376
I think we're good.

10:16.662 --> 10:20.931
Your father... is a very good man.

10:36.547 --> 10:38.347
So when are you going to talk to me?

10:42.386 --> 10:44.754
Talk about what?

10:44.756 --> 10:47.023
What happened to us when
you fell on your head.

10:48.492 --> 10:50.493
What happened back in Rosewood.

10:54.231 --> 10:55.198
I broke up with Hanna.

11:00.237 --> 11:01.904
Because of you.

11:03.307 --> 11:06.175
I promised her that I
would look out for you.

11:06.177 --> 11:08.744
I don't think I did a very
good job of that, do you?

11:14.250 --> 11:16.085
You told her I was dead?

11:16.087 --> 11:17.319
I couldn't.

11:17.321 --> 11:19.121
I couldn't tell her everything.

11:19.123 --> 11:20.756
She'd be here in a split second,

11:20.758 --> 11:23.492
and I can't have what
happened to you happen to her.

11:23.494 --> 11:26.394
If she's finished with me,
then I can't do her any harm.

11:26.396 --> 11:30.665
So if she doesn't know that I'm dead,

11:30.667 --> 11:32.567
you do realize what she
must be thinking about me,

11:32.569 --> 11:34.636
I mean, right?

11:34.638 --> 11:35.803
I guess I do.

11:35.805 --> 11:38.173
You guess?

11:38.175 --> 11:41.175
Caleb, she thinks I stole you from her.

11:41.177 --> 11:42.343
I don't think you need to be worrying about

11:42.345 --> 11:43.611
your reputation right now.

11:43.613 --> 11:44.912
Hey!

12:02.531 --> 12:03.664
Now...

12:06.801 --> 12:08.135
... we wait.

12:11.206 --> 12:12.706
Rem.

12:12.708 --> 12:14.675
Don't take this the wrong way,

12:14.677 --> 12:17.310
but you look exhausted.

12:17.312 --> 12:20.446
Just what every girl wants
to hear from her boyfriend.

12:20.448 --> 12:21.782
So I'm still your boyfriend?

12:21.784 --> 12:24.384
As long as you understand
it's not a part-time job.

12:24.386 --> 12:26.019
Understood.

12:26.021 --> 12:28.555
Okay.

12:28.557 --> 12:31.724
Rem, you have to get some rest, okay?

12:31.726 --> 12:32.892
We can't have you sleepwalking again.

12:32.894 --> 12:34.927
I will. But first I need to find out

12:34.929 --> 12:36.262
what's so important about this cameo.

12:36.264 --> 12:39.165
Esther must have put it in
that suitcase for a reason.

12:39.167 --> 12:40.633
Besides, sounds like Olivia needs you

12:40.635 --> 12:41.668
more than I do right now.

12:41.670 --> 12:43.203
Fine.

12:43.205 --> 12:45.004
But the second that you get drowsy...

12:45.006 --> 12:46.339
You'll be my first call.

12:46.341 --> 12:48.240
Okay.

13:00.687 --> 13:04.022
They were friends before
she married my dad.

13:04.024 --> 13:06.458
Collins and your mum?

13:06.460 --> 13:08.760
Now he's there. In my kitchen.

13:08.762 --> 13:12.097
It's a little creepy. You
know, he's an undertaker.

13:12.099 --> 13:15.234
Do you think Collins might hurt your mum?

13:15.236 --> 13:17.336
I don't know.

13:17.338 --> 13:18.403
I can't just sit around

13:18.405 --> 13:19.805
waiting for something bad to happen.

13:21.974 --> 13:23.341
I'll talk to you later.

13:23.343 --> 13:24.909
What happened to our date?

13:26.411 --> 13:27.879
Rain check?

13:30.916 --> 13:32.050
My parents are going away.

13:33.385 --> 13:36.054
Maybe tomorrow night you
can come over, we can...

13:36.056 --> 13:38.789
Watch movie, bake cookies?

13:38.791 --> 13:40.031
I suppose we could do that too.

13:43.562 --> 13:45.162
Let me think about it.

13:45.164 --> 13:46.063
I'll talk to you later.

13:46.065 --> 13:47.998
Be careful.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.567
Always am.

14:13.090 --> 14:14.130
How long was I out, Vicky?

14:15.859 --> 14:17.160
You were dead to the world.

14:17.162 --> 14:18.762
I didn't have the heart to wake you.

14:18.764 --> 14:20.029
- Is that for
me? - Mmm-hmm.

14:20.031 --> 14:21.964
Industrial strength,
just the way you like it.

14:21.966 --> 14:22.899
Keep 'em coming.

14:35.979 --> 14:37.013
What's that song?

14:37.015 --> 14:38.214
What song?

14:38.216 --> 14:40.382
The one you were just humming.

14:40.384 --> 14:41.717
Was that new?

14:41.719 --> 14:42.818
No, it's very old.

14:53.996 --> 14:55.297
Got a problem?

15:28.193 --> 15:29.761
Anyone home?

15:32.564 --> 15:33.464
Hello...

15:34.833 --> 15:37.101
Sorry.

15:37.103 --> 15:38.336
That's okay.

15:38.338 --> 15:39.570
Come to visit the shut-in?

15:39.572 --> 15:42.173
I could use some new companionship.

15:42.175 --> 15:43.974
Where's Caleb?

15:43.976 --> 15:45.009
He's out.

15:45.011 --> 15:46.877
Pull up a chair.

15:49.114 --> 15:51.115
Are you asking me to put
you back on the sleep aids?

15:51.117 --> 15:52.616
I don't know.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.651
It's not the sleeping, it's the dreaming.

15:54.653 --> 15:57.822
Well, what about the dreaming?

15:57.824 --> 16:00.089
I fall asleep and somebody
grabs the dream remote

16:00.091 --> 16:02.058
and switches to the nightmare channel.

16:02.060 --> 16:03.794
I see things. I don't know what.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.895
- You describe it.
- Let me try.

16:05.897 --> 16:10.367
Things are normal, and then they're not.

16:10.369 --> 16:14.604
They feel like there's
something else going on.

16:14.606 --> 16:16.372
I feel like somebody's
trying to show me something.

16:16.374 --> 16:19.709
Somebody is.

16:19.711 --> 16:23.446
You write and produce your dreams.

16:23.448 --> 16:26.182
If you remember that,
you can get more control.

16:26.184 --> 16:28.084
Control my dreams?

16:28.086 --> 16:32.621
What you do in them, how you react.

16:32.623 --> 16:34.122
It works, Remy.

16:34.124 --> 16:36.492
Look, when I got back from Afghanistan,

16:36.494 --> 16:39.595
sleep was a tricky place.

16:39.597 --> 16:42.732
But they taught me some
techniques that worked,

16:42.734 --> 16:44.500
and one of them is called lucid dreaming.

16:44.502 --> 16:47.603
Sounds like sleeping with your eyes open.

16:47.605 --> 16:49.938
It's more like sleeping
with your mind open.

16:49.940 --> 16:52.274
You decide what happens.

16:52.276 --> 16:58.146
No fear, no sense of powerlessness.

16:58.148 --> 17:01.783
What do I have to do?

17:01.785 --> 17:03.952
So where do you sleep?

17:08.089 --> 17:11.025
Not there.

17:11.027 --> 17:13.395
I don't really sleep.

17:13.396 --> 17:15.061
How is Caleb?

17:15.064 --> 17:20.201
He broke up with his
girlfriend in Ravenswood.

17:20.203 --> 17:21.635
Why?

17:21.637 --> 17:25.439
He doesn't want her involved
with this town or any of us.

17:25.441 --> 17:29.210
Wants to keep her safe.

17:30.712 --> 17:32.846
I feel the same way about Dillon,

17:32.848 --> 17:36.384
specially when he starts asking questions.

17:36.386 --> 17:37.785
Have you guys been together a long time?

17:37.787 --> 17:39.420
Since 9th grade.

17:39.422 --> 17:41.588
Did you two ever...

17:43.224 --> 17:45.091
Never mind.

17:45.093 --> 17:46.527
What?

17:48.162 --> 17:51.164
Where are you guys

17:51.166 --> 17:54.935
on the relationship spectrum?

17:54.937 --> 17:57.703
Are you asking if we've had sex?

17:57.705 --> 18:01.607
I would never just come out and ask that.

18:03.177 --> 18:04.577
But have you?

18:06.213 --> 18:07.880
Why do you want to know?

18:07.882 --> 18:12.552
It's just something I've been
thinking about a lot lately,

18:12.554 --> 18:15.387
in light of my current situation.

18:15.389 --> 18:18.958
Miranda, were you a virgin?

18:20.794 --> 18:23.863
Was, am, and I guess will always remain.

18:26.767 --> 18:31.770
I got close a couple of times
that, that I had more time.

18:31.772 --> 18:34.773
We haven't.

18:34.775 --> 18:36.075
Me and Dillon.

18:38.544 --> 18:39.644
Do you love him?

18:42.815 --> 18:44.616
Yeah.

18:44.618 --> 18:46.050
I do.

18:57.830 --> 18:59.163
I don't get it.

18:59.165 --> 19:00.631
If this preacher's everything
Esther made him out to me,

19:00.633 --> 19:03.501
how come I can't find
anything written about him?

19:03.503 --> 19:04.535
Don't worry.

19:04.537 --> 19:05.669
We'll find something.

19:05.671 --> 19:10.608
So you and Miranda,

19:10.610 --> 19:14.445
you were together in this other dimension?

19:14.447 --> 19:16.747
You're still having a right
down with all this, aren't you?

19:16.749 --> 19:18.682
I'm working on it.

19:18.684 --> 19:20.183
I don't have a choice.

19:20.185 --> 19:23.787
So in this place, where
you weren't exactly dead,

19:23.789 --> 19:25.255
and you weren't exactly alive...

19:25.257 --> 19:26.256
I made contact.

19:26.258 --> 19:28.626
Physical contact?

19:28.628 --> 19:29.793
Yeah.

19:29.795 --> 19:31.962
How physical?

19:31.964 --> 19:33.196
I touched her on the forehead.

19:33.198 --> 19:34.498
It's not like we kissed, okay?

19:34.500 --> 19:36.133
- Didn't mean anything.
- It did.

19:36.135 --> 19:39.036
If you had to point out
that you didn't kiss,

19:39.038 --> 19:40.537
it meant something.

19:43.941 --> 19:46.276
Mr. Collins was right there in our kitchen

19:46.278 --> 19:47.877
with an orchid for my mother.

19:47.879 --> 19:49.479
Was this his plan?

19:49.481 --> 19:51.981
Get rid of my dad so he
could move in on my mom.

19:51.983 --> 19:53.550
You know, everybody's been working

19:53.552 --> 19:55.317
on what we got from Esther's suitcase,

19:55.319 --> 19:57.020
but there still are the jars.

19:59.089 --> 20:00.356
You're being pulled back here.

20:00.358 --> 20:03.392
He must have put yours back together.

20:03.394 --> 20:05.094
If we can find them,

20:05.096 --> 20:07.196
if I can put them in front of
my mother, she'd have to listen.

20:07.198 --> 20:09.765
He won't be able to
explain his way out of it.

20:09.767 --> 20:11.467
I... I can't find them.

20:11.469 --> 20:12.734
They've got to be in here someplace.

20:12.736 --> 20:13.735
Your uncle knows where.

20:16.440 --> 20:18.174
There might be somebody else who knows.

20:18.176 --> 20:19.208
Grunwald?

20:19.210 --> 20:20.709
Let me take a run at her.

22:28.668 --> 22:30.559
I mean, one minute I'm
sneaking up on Grunwald

22:30.585 --> 22:32.017
doing my poltergeist thing

22:32.019 --> 22:34.787
next minute I'm getting seared
like a piece of ahi tuna.

22:34.789 --> 22:36.555
What was it?

22:36.557 --> 22:38.357
I don't know.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.062
Do you think it was one of the ghosts,

22:43.064 --> 22:44.797
one of the souls held by those jars?

22:44.799 --> 22:47.432
I think Grunwald did it.

22:47.434 --> 22:48.768
It stopped when she came back in.

22:52.538 --> 22:55.106
Maybe she has something to
protect her from people like you

22:55.108 --> 22:56.375
ghosts, a familiar.

23:08.287 --> 23:10.488
Hey.

23:10.490 --> 23:14.258
Now exhale... and let go of the day.

23:14.260 --> 23:16.526
Nothing else matters.

23:16.528 --> 23:20.463
Only you and a good night's sleep.

23:20.465 --> 23:23.934
One, I'm dreaming.

23:23.936 --> 23:28.171
Two, I'm dreaming.

23:28.173 --> 23:30.239
Three, I'm dreaming.

23:33.911 --> 23:36.212
I'm glad you're here.

23:36.214 --> 23:38.381
Me too, baby.

23:38.383 --> 23:41.818
And I'm not going
anywhere, so you can relax.

23:44.087 --> 23:46.555
Four, I'm dreaming.

23:46.557 --> 23:51.194
Five, I'm dreaming.

23:54.198 --> 23:55.764
Hello, Mrs. Grunwald.

23:55.766 --> 23:57.200
Hello, Olivia. How are you?

23:57.202 --> 23:58.634
I'm all right.

23:58.636 --> 24:00.136
And how's your mother doing?

24:00.138 --> 24:02.304
You should ask Mr. Collins about my mother.

24:02.306 --> 24:03.539
Why would he know something

24:03.541 --> 24:05.374
about your mother that you wouldn't?

24:05.376 --> 24:06.542
'Cause he's suddenly
showing up at our house

24:06.544 --> 24:07.710
to spend time with her.

24:07.712 --> 24:11.213
They knew each other for a very long time.

24:11.215 --> 24:13.315
They're just catching up. Excuse me.

24:13.317 --> 24:18.153
I wanted to ask you about Miranda Collins.

24:18.155 --> 24:20.655
It was very kind of you
to come to her service.

24:20.657 --> 24:22.991
Funny, I feel like I'm
getting to know her better

24:22.993 --> 24:25.026
since she died.

24:25.028 --> 24:27.229
Like she's still here.

24:27.231 --> 24:28.230
Isn't that strange?

24:28.232 --> 24:29.697
Not that strange.

24:29.699 --> 24:30.798
Maybe she is still here.

24:30.800 --> 24:32.633
Something's stopping her from moving on.

24:32.635 --> 24:34.268
And what possibly could do that?

24:34.270 --> 24:38.205
Could be something big,
could be something small,

24:38.207 --> 24:42.009
something so small it would
fit in a jar about that size.

24:42.011 --> 24:44.579
To capture a soul in something that small,

24:44.581 --> 24:46.781
it would have to be very powerful.

24:46.783 --> 24:49.917
We found them once.

24:49.919 --> 24:51.385
We'll find them again.

24:54.689 --> 24:56.223
Be careful, my dear.

24:56.225 --> 25:00.427
You think you have the answers,

25:00.429 --> 25:05.399
but you don't even know
what the questions are.

25:28.956 --> 25:30.856
So, where were we?

25:32.393 --> 25:36.629
We were talking about how I made sure

25:36.631 --> 25:40.399
that Hanna hates you,
and thinks I'm a jerk.

25:43.503 --> 25:45.471
What about the other thing?

25:45.473 --> 25:49.141
The thing where I was unconscious?

25:49.143 --> 25:52.010
You were way more than unconscious, pal.

25:52.012 --> 25:55.180
Yeah.

25:55.182 --> 25:57.082
Guess you're right.

26:00.786 --> 26:03.922
I have something really
terrible to tell you.

26:03.924 --> 26:05.657
What?

26:09.662 --> 26:14.298
When we're together, I am...

26:14.300 --> 26:17.168
I almost asked you to stay with me.

26:21.273 --> 26:23.475
I understand.

26:23.477 --> 26:25.844
It's lonely there.

26:25.846 --> 26:29.646
I didn't want you to
stay just for the company.

26:34.953 --> 26:38.655
What kept you from asking?

26:38.657 --> 26:43.995
Mostly because I wasn't
sure that you and I,

26:43.997 --> 26:46.029
you know...

28:19.721 --> 28:20.221
Remy.

29:10.203 --> 29:12.939
It's okay, it's all right, Remy.

29:12.941 --> 29:15.274
You can close your eyes, it's just a dream.

29:15.276 --> 29:17.576
Just a dream.

29:23.601 --> 29:26.250
Why didn't you tell me
you're having these dreams?

29:26.252 --> 29:28.186
Because of that look
on your face right now.

29:28.188 --> 29:29.287
Well, you should have told me.

29:29.289 --> 29:31.189
I could have done something.

29:31.191 --> 29:32.490
I'm telling you now

29:32.492 --> 29:34.325
because I think there's
something you can do.

29:34.327 --> 29:35.859
Listen, in this last dream

29:35.861 --> 29:37.895
I know I was seeing a real place.

29:37.897 --> 29:40.831
I know that scarecrow wasn't a part of it.

29:40.833 --> 29:42.733
It was something that was
trying to stop me from dreaming.

29:42.735 --> 29:44.401
By scaring you in your
dream and waking you up?

29:44.403 --> 29:46.636
Right, but when it couldn't
stop me in my dream,

29:46.638 --> 29:48.338
it had to stop me from dreaming.

29:48.340 --> 29:52.176
By showing up in your room?

29:52.178 --> 29:54.745
This is more than just a dream, Luke.

29:54.747 --> 29:55.879
It feels like a journey.

29:59.950 --> 30:04.053
Do you think you're going
to start sleepwalking again?

30:04.055 --> 30:07.155
I know I'm going to sleepwalk,
and this time I want to.

30:07.157 --> 30:09.825
But I need you to be
there while I'm sleeping

30:09.827 --> 30:11.093
to make sure that nothing wakes me

30:11.095 --> 30:12.695
till I want to wake up.

30:12.697 --> 30:15.997
Whatever happens, I need you to promise me

30:15.999 --> 30:17.733
that you won't wake me up.

30:17.735 --> 30:19.134
I can't promise that, Remy.

30:19.136 --> 30:20.369
What if you're in danger?

30:20.371 --> 30:22.971
I trust you to protect me.

30:22.973 --> 30:24.206
But I need you to promise.

30:29.812 --> 30:32.247
All right.

30:32.249 --> 30:34.649
All right.

30:34.651 --> 30:35.951
I don't think your parents
are going to like the idea

30:35.953 --> 30:37.585
of me sitting up all night in your room.

30:41.590 --> 30:44.259
We'll have to figure out
a safe place to sleep.

31:04.913 --> 31:07.248
I haven't had this many
people try and watch me sleep

31:07.250 --> 31:09.549
since I was in the Princess
and the Pea in kindergarten.

31:11.118 --> 31:12.686
Do you think you're going
to be able to sleep here?

31:12.688 --> 31:14.187
It's a little early.

31:14.189 --> 31:16.222
My mom is not letting
all of you in my bedroom.

31:19.461 --> 31:21.495
It's Dillon.

31:21.497 --> 31:23.664
I'd better talk to him.

31:23.666 --> 31:24.665
Hello?

31:24.667 --> 31:26.032
Hey, tell me where you are.

31:26.034 --> 31:28.734
- I'll pick you up.
- I can't tonight, Dillon.

31:28.736 --> 31:30.736
- I've really got to study.
- Well, I'll help you.

31:30.738 --> 31:32.438
I don't think that's a good idea.

31:32.440 --> 31:34.274
Listen, I don't want you by yourself

31:34.276 --> 31:36.109
if that freak Collins
is coming to your house.

31:36.111 --> 31:37.911
You're going to be with me tonight.

31:37.913 --> 31:40.413
That's that.

31:40.415 --> 31:42.448
He wants to see me.

31:42.450 --> 31:43.582
Well, he can't come here.

31:43.584 --> 31:45.351
I'd better meet him.

31:45.353 --> 31:46.786
Are you sure?

31:46.788 --> 31:47.886
I don't want to mix him up in all this.

31:47.888 --> 31:51.290
I'll be safe with him.

31:51.292 --> 31:53.359
You win. Okay.

31:53.361 --> 31:55.260
I'll see you in ten minutes.

31:55.262 --> 31:57.763
I'll feel a lot better when I see you.

31:57.765 --> 31:58.964
Bye.

32:02.401 --> 32:03.302
Satisfied?

32:05.671 --> 32:07.840
I'm not the one you have
to worry about pleasing.

32:10.944 --> 32:11.977
I'll work it out.

32:11.979 --> 32:14.546
I'm sure you will,

32:14.548 --> 32:18.450
otherwise it's the grinder for both of us.

32:21.721 --> 32:23.120
Can we stop for ice cream?

32:48.080 --> 32:50.614
Remy, hey, get up, get up.

32:50.616 --> 32:52.549
Here we go.

32:52.551 --> 32:54.451
Let Caleb get the door.

33:00.792 --> 33:02.259
What is that for?

33:02.261 --> 33:03.861
Self-confidence.

33:03.863 --> 33:07.040
Look out, Caleb, be careful.

33:26.272 --> 33:28.574
I told my brother I'd be safe with you.

33:28.576 --> 33:30.543
You are safe with me.

33:30.545 --> 33:33.612
What?

33:33.614 --> 33:35.781
I'm just looking at you.

33:37.150 --> 33:38.850
It's a pretty serious look.

33:38.852 --> 33:42.054
I want to remember what
you look like tonight.

33:42.056 --> 33:44.256
What's so special about tonight?

34:17.589 --> 34:18.722
That's right.

34:18.724 --> 34:20.358
I'm getting better at this.

34:23.628 --> 34:25.829
Child.

34:30.101 --> 34:31.333
I know you're upset.

34:34.237 --> 34:37.440
I can feel your anger.

34:37.442 --> 34:40.143
You're going to feel a
whole lot more than anger

34:40.145 --> 34:44.147
if anything happens to
Caleb and my friends.

34:44.149 --> 34:47.783
I know you must feel like a prisoner.

34:49.320 --> 34:53.656
But you must understand
this is the only way.

35:12.777 --> 35:16.646
Stop it, now!

35:56.185 --> 35:58.152
Do you have any idea where she's going?

35:58.154 --> 36:00.388
Your guess is as good as mine.

36:05.860 --> 36:07.160
Now what?

36:29.217 --> 36:30.183
Let's check it out.

36:30.185 --> 36:31.118
Hold on, hold on.

36:33.421 --> 36:36.156
The words from the prayer book.

36:36.158 --> 36:37.023
Page 36?

36:58.378 --> 37:01.180
Thomas Rivers, you know this is wrong.

37:01.182 --> 37:02.314
Ravenswood has suffered enough.

37:03.896 --> 37:05.284
As I was saying,

37:05.286 --> 37:09.021
you'll find the words on page 36.

37:30.441 --> 37:32.743
What do you think she sees?

37:32.745 --> 37:34.645
I have no idea.

37:40.385 --> 37:41.885
I want to look in there.

38:40.076 --> 38:41.409
Did you hear that?

38:41.411 --> 38:42.944
Hear what?

38:48.640 --> 38:50.823
- We're getting her out of here.
- No, not yet.

38:50.848 --> 38:52.615
- You promised you wouldn't wake her.
- It's not safe!

38:52.617 --> 38:54.617
We are not going to get another chance.

39:16.039 --> 39:17.472
You think it's gone?

39:56.411 --> 39:57.979
I'm so over this.

40:08.069 --> 40:09.390
You're doing the right thing, son.

40:44.304 --> 40:46.205
It's done.

41:22.041 --> 41:23.374
What is it? What did you see?

41:23.376 --> 41:24.375
What did you see?

41:24.377 --> 41:26.011
Remy, what happened in there?

41:26.013 --> 41:27.545
They saw it. They saw the pact being made.

41:27.547 --> 41:28.846
What? Who, who?

41:28.848 --> 41:30.714
Caleb and Miranda, the
original Caleb and Miranda.

41:30.716 --> 41:32.216
What about the preacher?

41:32.218 --> 41:33.484
He's gone, but there's something else.

41:33.486 --> 41:34.926
I think he was working with somebody.

41:38.023 --> 41:40.184
I think it was something to
do with the Collins family.

42:12.089 --> 42:13.923
I know.

42:13.925 --> 42:16.493
I love you too.
