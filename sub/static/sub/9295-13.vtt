00:12.477 --> 00:16.178
u know him,
don't you?

00:16.247 --> 00:19.248
Mr. Prady, we are in the middle
of a national security crisis.

00:19.316 --> 00:21.683
I have to go back to my desk.

00:21.751 --> 00:23.910
Okay, perhaps if I talk
to your supervisor,

00:23.978 --> 00:26.028
he could let you
take a few minutes off.

00:27.201 --> 00:28.810
It's over.

00:28.878 --> 00:31.364
The parole officer looking
for Kevin is here in CTU.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.306
He's after the raw feed.
I'm gonna give it to him, Cole.

00:33.380 --> 00:35.052
Why don't you wait?

00:35.120 --> 00:36.324
Do you hear me?

00:36.395 --> 00:38.937
He knows everything;
he'll go to Hastings.

00:39.005 --> 00:42.756
Do what he says and
you won't get hurt.

00:42.823 --> 00:44.361
Who is he?

00:44.432 --> 00:46.270
Another traitor?

00:47.342 --> 00:51.288
The only traitor is your father.

00:51.356 --> 00:53.563
We haven't disabled the American
radiological detectors yet.

00:53.630 --> 00:55.132
Where are the nuclear rods?

00:55.200 --> 00:56.597
They're still outside the city.

00:56.665 --> 00:57.888
How will you bring
the rods to me?

00:57.956 --> 00:59.618
It's been taken care of.

00:59.685 --> 01:01.557
Let's go!

01:01.625 --> 01:02.893
Stop them!

01:05.465 --> 01:08.303
Tarin, no!

01:08.371 --> 01:09.506
Oh!

01:11.244 --> 01:13.081
Mr. Hastings, you better
take this; it's Kayla Hassan!

01:13.149 --> 01:14.420
She's in a car; she's escaped.

01:14.488 --> 01:16.991
They tried to kill me,
but Tarin got me out.

01:17.058 --> 01:18.259
They shot him.

01:18.327 --> 01:21.265
He told me to call CTU!

01:21.333 --> 01:23.402
Ms. Hassan,
my name is Jack Bauer.

01:23.471 --> 01:25.807
We need to know
where you were being held.

01:25.875 --> 01:27.477
We got the location, Jack.

01:27.545 --> 01:29.246
Targets are heading
north on Orchard.

01:29.314 --> 01:31.447
They're getting into an SUV.

01:31.515 --> 01:32.815
We ID'd one of the targets
as Tarin Faroush; Kayla said

01:32.882 --> 01:35.650
he sacrificed himself to
save her, but he's still alive.

01:35.718 --> 01:38.352
Chloe, the car that Tarin
got into-- where is it now?

01:38.420 --> 01:40.891
Taking the first exit
off the Williamsburg Bridge.

01:40.958 --> 01:42.125
You've gotta put
Hastings on now.

01:42.193 --> 01:44.158
I'm on, Jack.

01:44.226 --> 01:45.723
You cannot let Kayla Hassan in.

01:45.791 --> 01:46.857
The terrorists faked her escape.

01:46.925 --> 01:48.292
They wanted to get her to CTU.

01:48.360 --> 01:49.160
She's in the tunnel.

01:49.228 --> 01:50.995
Stop the car!
Whoa, whoa!

01:51.062 --> 01:51.829
Put your hands where
we can see them!

01:51.897 --> 01:53.699
It's an EMP!

01:59.376 --> 02:00.610
What the hell's happening?

02:00.678 --> 02:02.179
Contact NSA.

02:02.246 --> 02:04.081
Terrorists just took down CTU.

02:32.078 --> 02:34.112
Central comm node
is totally fried.

02:34.180 --> 02:36.148
Reroute to peripherals.
I already tried that.

02:36.215 --> 02:37.649
Try again, Chloe.

02:37.717 --> 02:39.351
Sir, I can't give you
the status on the drones.

02:39.419 --> 02:40.920
Everything's down.
Which means what?

02:40.988 --> 02:42.956
That they're going to fall
out of the sky? Not yet.

02:43.023 --> 02:45.424
The nav systems should
default to autopilot.

02:45.492 --> 02:47.460
They'll circle until
they run out of gas.

02:47.528 --> 02:48.895
But we've lost all
aerial surveillance

02:48.963 --> 02:50.764
and radiological
detection capability.

02:50.832 --> 02:52.332
Basically.

02:52.400 --> 02:54.735
All right.

02:54.803 --> 02:57.038
Agent Skaggs is heading
outside on foot.

02:57.105 --> 02:59.573
Have him contact FAA with the
drones' default flight paths.

02:59.641 --> 03:01.275
They need to be taken down

03:01.343 --> 03:02.710
before they crash
into populated areas.

03:02.778 --> 03:04.445
Yes, sir.

03:08.784 --> 03:10.051
Are you okay?

03:10.119 --> 03:12.420
Am I okay?

03:12.488 --> 03:13.956
An EMP just took us
out of play

03:14.023 --> 03:15.324
and now we're
dropping the ball

03:15.391 --> 03:17.259
on a radiological threat
against New York City.

03:17.327 --> 03:19.762
So, no, Chloe,
I am not okay.

03:19.830 --> 03:22.131
And I won't be until
we find those rods.

03:22.199 --> 03:24.467
Sir, Kayla Hassan is
finished in Medical.

03:24.535 --> 03:26.136
Okay, I need her
taken back to the UN

03:26.204 --> 03:27.638
so she can be evacuated
with her family.

03:27.706 --> 03:29.574
Okay, I'll do it.
No, I'll do it.

03:29.641 --> 03:31.242
I need you to assemble
division heads.

03:31.310 --> 03:32.978
Tell them that we have
a briefing in ten minutes.

03:33.045 --> 03:36.047
Tell them to come with full
damage assessment reports.

03:36.115 --> 03:40.218
Sir, their systems are down.
They can't generate reports.

03:40.285 --> 03:42.420
Then tell them to use a pen
and a damn legal pad.

03:48.060 --> 03:49.761
Phil Holden.

03:49.828 --> 03:51.228
Phil, it's Jack Bauer.

03:51.296 --> 03:53.826
Ah, Jack, I heard you
were back in play.

03:53.894 --> 03:55.259
Phil, look, I don't have
a lot of time,

03:55.326 --> 03:56.727
I need you to listen to me
carefully.

03:56.795 --> 03:58.529
Go ahead. There's an IRK
splinter cell trying to smuggle

03:58.597 --> 04:00.231
weapons-grade uranium
into the city.

04:00.298 --> 04:02.500
Yeah, I just read
the threat assessment.

04:02.567 --> 04:04.835
It says you've got
a CTU team tracking them.

04:04.903 --> 04:06.136
We did, but we lost them.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.672
CTU just got hit by some
electromagnetic pulse device,

04:08.740 --> 04:11.208
wiped out all
our visual and comm.

04:11.276 --> 04:12.409
I want you to try
and locate our hostiles

04:12.477 --> 04:13.844
with one of your satellites.

04:13.912 --> 04:16.012
We don't have any birds
over the metro area, Jack.

04:16.079 --> 04:19.183
All aerial surveillance
was being routed through CTU.

04:19.250 --> 04:20.985
What about traffic cams?

04:21.052 --> 04:22.619
I can try.

04:22.687 --> 04:24.952
Give me the hostiles'
last location.

04:25.020 --> 04:26.617
They got off the
Williamsburg Bridge

04:26.684 --> 04:28.217
at the West Broadway/
Roebling Street exit.

04:28.285 --> 04:29.485
They're driving a gray SUV.

04:29.552 --> 04:31.652
I'll call you
if we get a hit.

04:31.719 --> 04:33.085
Phil, I also need you
to shut down

04:33.153 --> 04:34.586
all bridge and tunnel traffic
into the city.

04:34.653 --> 04:37.355
Thanks.
Done.

04:40.591 --> 04:41.991
Where are you going?
NSA's shutting

04:42.059 --> 04:43.592
all bridge and tunnel traffic
into the city.

04:43.660 --> 04:45.994
There's only one way
for them to get in.

04:46.062 --> 04:47.062
Across the East River.

04:47.130 --> 04:49.497
That's right.

05:13.884 --> 05:15.150
CTU is down.

05:15.218 --> 05:16.485
You have confirmation?

05:16.552 --> 05:19.787
I have a real-time uplink
to the power grid.

05:19.855 --> 05:22.390
It recorded a pulse surge
and now nothing.

05:22.457 --> 05:25.392
CTU is blind,
deaf, and dumb.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.560
Have you secured this area?
As you ordered.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.534
You've done well, Ali.

05:35.602 --> 05:36.869
Thank you, sir.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.470
Load the rods into the Zodiac.

05:48.717 --> 05:53.120
I realize this was very
difficult for you,

05:53.188 --> 05:58.492
but Hassan's daughter
was a necessary sacrifice.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.127
Using her was the only way
for us

06:00.194 --> 06:01.628
to get the rods into the city.

06:19.881 --> 06:23.817
Agents Beck and Henderson
will escort you back to the UN.

06:23.885 --> 06:25.285
First, tell me
what's going on.

06:25.353 --> 06:27.120
Agent Beck will brief you
on the way.

06:27.188 --> 06:29.222
Now, once you're there, we need
you to do something for us.

06:29.290 --> 06:32.893
Your father gave us a file
of IRK covert agents

06:32.961 --> 06:34.261
operating in this country.

06:34.328 --> 06:35.428
We need you to identify

06:35.496 --> 06:37.196
the men working
with Tarin.

06:37.264 --> 06:41.333
I'm not doing anything until
you tell me what's happening.

06:45.305 --> 06:46.938
The car you drove here
was rigged

06:47.006 --> 06:49.740
with an EMP device.

06:49.808 --> 06:53.443
It's a pulse weapon designed
to disarm electronics.

06:53.511 --> 06:55.211
It's crashed all our systems.

06:55.279 --> 06:57.146
I don't understand.

06:57.213 --> 06:59.014
Tarin put me in that car.

06:59.082 --> 07:01.083
He used you, Ms. Hassan.

07:01.150 --> 07:03.118
He staged your escape,

07:03.185 --> 07:04.785
put you in that car,
and sent you back here.

07:06.388 --> 07:08.221
But he was shot.

07:08.289 --> 07:09.656
I saw him.

07:09.723 --> 07:12.057
He is alive.

07:12.125 --> 07:16.127
We spotted him
a few minutes ago.

07:16.195 --> 07:17.929
I know it's a lot
to take in,

07:17.997 --> 07:19.263
but you need to go
with these agents

07:19.331 --> 07:21.866
back to the UN and start
looking through those files.

07:21.933 --> 07:24.501
You've seen
these terrorists.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.336
If you can help us
to ID them,

07:26.403 --> 07:28.170
we stand a chance
of finding them

07:28.238 --> 07:30.038
before they carry out
their attack.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.246
Ahman has prepared the bomb.

07:45.314 --> 07:47.147
It'll be short work

07:47.215 --> 07:49.316
once we get the rods
across the river.

07:49.384 --> 07:51.421
MAN (over radio):
A vehicle is coming.

07:51.489 --> 07:53.058
Where is it?

07:53.126 --> 07:54.695
It's coming from the east.

07:57.398 --> 07:59.933
Black SUV, no markings.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.002
How many men have you got covering?
Three.

08:04.305 --> 08:06.539
Wait until the SUV's
in the range,

08:06.607 --> 08:08.307
then take them out.

08:08.375 --> 08:10.276
Ali! Come!

08:37.940 --> 08:39.841
Hold on.
What is it?

08:39.909 --> 08:41.476
Thought I caught something
in the infrared.

08:41.544 --> 08:43.544
Heat source down by the water.

08:43.611 --> 08:44.879
Now it's gone.

08:44.946 --> 08:46.380
See if NYPD can get
some units down here.

08:46.448 --> 08:48.182
I'll contact NSA,
see if they've got

08:48.249 --> 08:49.783
surveillance of the area.

08:59.125 --> 09:00.425
That's weird.

09:00.492 --> 09:02.026
I got four bars, but the
call's not going through.

09:02.094 --> 09:03.428
Me neither.

09:07.500 --> 09:09.702
We're being jammed.

09:09.770 --> 09:11.604
They're here. Damn it!

09:15.275 --> 09:16.575
Get down now!

09:37.094 --> 09:38.261
(engine cranking)
Come on!

09:38.328 --> 09:40.763
The engine's down.
Pass your weapons up front!

09:43.866 --> 09:45.233
Cole, I want you to take
the sniper to your north.

09:45.301 --> 09:47.201
Maintain coverage
until we're clear.

09:47.269 --> 09:48.867
I want both of you
to get ready to unload

09:48.935 --> 09:50.735
all the weapons from
the back, you ready?

09:50.802 --> 09:51.969
Yes, sir.
Let's go, go, go!

10:04.679 --> 10:06.679
How did they know
where to look for us?

10:06.747 --> 10:08.714
They must have followed us
from the vault.

10:09.716 --> 10:12.317
Cole, use your infrared!

10:12.384 --> 10:13.718
Call out the snipers
as you see them!

10:18.655 --> 10:20.956
Ten o'clock, high and low!

10:25.227 --> 10:26.527
I'm counting four men.

10:26.595 --> 10:28.462
I recognize one
from the hospital.

10:28.530 --> 10:30.230
He was the one
that talked Marcos

10:30.298 --> 10:31.931
out of detonating the vest.

10:33.566 --> 10:35.901
It's Jack Bauer.

10:35.968 --> 10:38.470
Ex-CTU. He was one
of their best agents.

10:40.472 --> 10:42.640
Nine o'clock low!

10:48.179 --> 10:50.280
We can still cross
with the rods.

10:52.684 --> 10:55.953
As long as we're certain Bauer
and his men cannot warn anyone.

10:56.020 --> 10:57.287
It's not a risk.

10:57.355 --> 10:59.255
We started jamming
their communications

10:59.323 --> 11:01.991
as soon as they were in sight.

11:02.059 --> 11:04.660
Now they can't leave.

11:04.728 --> 11:06.528
Not with the snipers
in position.

11:06.595 --> 11:09.197
Good.

11:09.265 --> 11:11.165
Make sure none of them
get out alive.

11:11.233 --> 11:13.100
I'll call you
when we're across the river.

11:13.168 --> 11:15.169
Let's move.

11:33.082 --> 11:34.082
Reloading!

11:38.689 --> 11:41.290
I've got two men,
leaving the dock in a boat.

11:41.358 --> 11:42.359
One of them is Tarin Faroush.

11:42.427 --> 11:43.694
They're carrying a box

11:43.762 --> 11:45.362
the right size and shape
for the rods, Jack.

11:45.430 --> 11:47.932
Copy that!

11:51.402 --> 11:52.335
Went out of my range.

11:52.403 --> 11:53.303
We got to notify NYPD

11:53.371 --> 11:54.737
before they cross the river.

11:54.805 --> 11:56.172
I tried cell
and radio frequencies.

11:56.239 --> 11:57.239
They're all jammed.

11:59.975 --> 12:02.943
There's a call box mounted
on the building. Ten o'clock.

12:06.313 --> 12:07.580
It's gotta be a hard line.

12:07.648 --> 12:08.647
We can call from there.

12:08.715 --> 12:09.982
How do we get there?

12:10.050 --> 12:11.818
The way the shooters are
positioned, they'll pick us off

12:11.886 --> 12:13.220
one by one
as soon as we step out

12:13.287 --> 12:14.689
from behind the vehicle.

12:14.757 --> 12:16.557
Our vehicle's armored.

12:16.625 --> 12:18.259
We can pull the panels,
use them for coverage.

12:19.928 --> 12:21.094
Start now!

12:22.230 --> 12:25.465
Eleven o'clock, Jack!

12:35.085 --> 12:37.019
Casualty reports are
also coming in.

12:37.087 --> 12:38.587
Three fatalities
from the bomb blast

12:38.655 --> 12:39.922
in the motor pool tunnel.

12:39.990 --> 12:41.123
Damn it.

12:41.191 --> 12:43.125
What else?
Minor injuries for the most part.

12:43.193 --> 12:45.027
Agent McCallan was burned
in a small electrical fire.

12:45.095 --> 12:46.295
How is he?

12:46.363 --> 12:47.496
He's going to be okay.

12:47.564 --> 12:48.697
But with our infirmary down

12:48.765 --> 12:50.832
we had to transport him
to the local hospital.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.634
Says here we have
flooding.

12:52.701 --> 12:53.868
Yes, sir, the pumps
are down,

12:53.936 --> 12:55.369
and certain sections
of the basement

12:55.436 --> 12:56.870
have about six inches of water.

12:56.938 --> 12:58.871
Well, can you stop it
or are we all going to drown?

12:58.939 --> 13:00.772
The repair crew's
working on it, sir.

13:00.840 --> 13:02.507
Okay, give me another update
in 20 minutes.

13:02.575 --> 13:04.442
Excuse me, sir?

13:04.509 --> 13:06.377
Yes, what is it?
A team from NSA is here.

13:06.444 --> 13:08.011
NSA?

13:20.232 --> 13:22.202
Brian Hastings,

13:22.270 --> 13:23.505
director of CTU.

13:23.572 --> 13:25.677
Frank Haynam, senior engineer

13:25.745 --> 13:26.913
at the New York
field office.

13:26.980 --> 13:28.750
I understand you've
been hit by an EMP.

13:28.818 --> 13:30.286
Yeah, that's right.
I hope that you're here

13:30.354 --> 13:32.057
to help because we can
damn well use it.

13:32.125 --> 13:33.293
We are indeed.

13:33.361 --> 13:34.528
Brought my best men with me.

13:34.596 --> 13:36.196
I thought we'd start
by restoring

13:36.263 --> 13:38.130
your aerial surveillance
and communications.

13:38.198 --> 13:39.798
So, where's your server room?
It's downstairs.

13:39.866 --> 13:41.536
I'll let my maintenance team
know what you're here.

13:41.603 --> 13:43.708
You boys can put
your heads together.

13:43.776 --> 13:45.412
I prefer to work
with my own people.

13:45.480 --> 13:49.385
There's no one more familiar
with this facility than my crew.

13:49.453 --> 13:50.987
Not exactly true.

13:51.054 --> 13:53.258
I was part of the group
that helped design this place.

13:53.326 --> 13:55.329
Can't say I'm thrilled
with what you've done with it.

13:57.299 --> 13:59.901
How did you find out
we were hit?

13:59.969 --> 14:02.103
Jack Bauer called our
regional headquarters.

14:02.171 --> 14:03.471
Told us your situation.

14:03.539 --> 14:05.806
Bauer was pursuing the men
behind this attack

14:05.874 --> 14:07.341
when we lost contact with him.

14:07.409 --> 14:08.843
Do you know
where he is?

14:08.911 --> 14:10.844
NSA's been trying
to call him back.

14:10.912 --> 14:12.145
He's not answering.

14:12.212 --> 14:13.212
They're not sure why.

14:14.248 --> 14:16.316
Right this way.

14:27.907 --> 14:29.846
Chloe, we're supposed to be
writing damage assessments.

14:29.914 --> 14:30.949
What are you doing?

14:31.017 --> 14:32.050
There might be away to tap in,

14:32.117 --> 14:33.183
get some of our systems
up and running.

14:33.251 --> 14:34.485
Really? How?

14:34.553 --> 14:35.653
I haven't figured it out yet,

14:35.720 --> 14:37.121
and I won't if you
keep talking to me.

14:37.189 --> 14:39.190
All right, people,
listen up.

14:43.863 --> 14:45.431
This is Frank Haynam,

14:45.499 --> 14:47.900
senior engineer of the NSA's
New York field office.

14:47.968 --> 14:49.969
Now, he and his team
are going to help us

14:50.037 --> 14:53.640
restore aerial surveillance
and communications.

14:53.708 --> 14:56.709
So we can get back
to tracking the nuclear rods.

14:56.777 --> 15:00.313
They also brought along a fresh
batch of cell phones.

15:00.381 --> 15:01.970
Give them your
full cooperation.

15:02.037 --> 15:03.849
Whatever they need,
make it happen.

15:03.917 --> 15:06.618
Now, we have been knocked down,
but I promise you,

15:06.686 --> 15:08.853
we are going
to get back up.

15:08.921 --> 15:10.154
Let's get to work.

15:10.222 --> 15:13.691
Agent Blochard, can you get
Mr. Haynam and his team

15:13.759 --> 15:15.159
down to the server room?

15:17.195 --> 15:19.096
Has NSA heard
from Jack?

15:19.164 --> 15:20.330
Yeah. They spoke with Jack

15:20.398 --> 15:21.998
and his team
about 20 minutes ago,

15:22.066 --> 15:23.166
but haven't been able
to reach him since.

15:23.234 --> 15:24.634
Why not?
They don't know.

15:24.702 --> 15:25.868
He could be in some
kind of trouble.

15:25.936 --> 15:27.636
You need to send men
out looking for him.

15:27.704 --> 15:29.305
Even if I had agents available,

15:29.372 --> 15:30.506
I wouldn't know
where to send them.

15:30.573 --> 15:32.074
Jack was heading
toward the East River.

15:32.142 --> 15:34.176
That's four square miles
of real estate--

15:34.243 --> 15:35.811
too much for me
to commit resources

15:35.878 --> 15:36.845
that we don't have.

15:36.913 --> 15:38.846
He was pursuing the terrorists.

15:38.914 --> 15:40.814
He's our best chance
at stopping this attack.

15:40.881 --> 15:42.448
We're going to focus
on our efforts here.

15:42.516 --> 15:43.682
When we get our eyes
and ears back,

15:43.750 --> 15:45.718
we'll find them.
It might be too late.

15:45.785 --> 15:48.988
If anyone can take care
of themselves, it's Jack.

15:49.055 --> 15:51.156
Now, I want you to go
to the server room,

15:51.224 --> 15:53.124
make sure Haynam has everything
he needs.

16:02.566 --> 16:03.999
Worse than I thought.

16:04.067 --> 16:05.434
90% of these components
are fried.

16:05.501 --> 16:07.102
We're going to have
to swap them out

16:07.170 --> 16:09.170
and install new server boards.

16:11.974 --> 16:13.974
Mr. Haynam.

16:15.844 --> 16:17.077
I'm Chloe O'Brian.

16:17.145 --> 16:18.578
Mr. Hastings wanted me to make
sure you have everything

16:18.646 --> 16:20.647
you need.
We're fine, Ms. O'Brian. Thank you.

16:23.851 --> 16:25.785
You're going in through
the CLR processor?

16:25.852 --> 16:27.119
That's right.
We're going to isolate it

16:27.186 --> 16:28.954
from the main servers and
create a brand-new subnet.

16:29.021 --> 16:31.555
Creating a brand-new subnet
from scratch?

16:31.623 --> 16:32.756
That'll take forever.

16:32.824 --> 16:34.991
Ms. O'Brian, thanks
for offering your help.

16:35.059 --> 16:36.192
We'll take it from here.

16:36.259 --> 16:37.526
Look, I think
there's another way.

16:37.594 --> 16:39.193
I've been looking
at the CTU schematics.

16:39.261 --> 16:40.828
Why not tap directly
into the trunk line?

16:40.896 --> 16:42.195
Because I'm not insane.

16:42.263 --> 16:45.564
Mr. Haynam, we need to make sure
those nuclear rods

16:45.631 --> 16:46.998
don't get into
the city.

16:47.066 --> 16:49.200
What I'm suggesting
wille a lot faster.

16:49.267 --> 16:50.868
Yeah, and it could make things
a whole lot worse.

16:50.936 --> 16:52.736
How could things be any worse?

16:52.804 --> 16:54.838
You reopen that trunk line
without system buffers in place,

16:54.906 --> 16:56.040
you could cause an overload,

16:56.107 --> 16:58.175
wind up electrocuting
yourself,

16:58.309 --> 16:59.309
not to mention starting a fire

16:59.377 --> 17:00.443
that canurn down
half the building.

17:00.511 --> 17:01.811
I'm aware of the risks.

17:01.879 --> 17:03.246
I think I can create
a workaround.

17:03.314 --> 17:04.446
You couldn't keep an EMP

17:04.515 --> 17:05.714
from taking out
your whole operation.

17:05.781 --> 17:07.616
Forgive me if I don't bow
to your expertise.

17:07.684 --> 17:11.452
If you'd stop with the cheap
insults and just listen to me.

17:11.520 --> 17:12.686
Look, I'm not here
to brainstorm.

17:12.753 --> 17:14.054
I'm here to clean up your mess.

17:14.122 --> 17:15.387
You need to leave.

17:15.455 --> 17:16.388
Now.

17:16.457 --> 17:18.757
I said now,
Ms. O'Brian.

17:18.825 --> 17:19.992
I won't ask you again.

17:27.931 --> 17:29.931
Start prepping the CLR
for a diagnostic.

17:37.338 --> 17:39.272
Arlo, is there any other way

17:39.340 --> 17:41.307
to get into the trunk line
besides the server room?

17:41.375 --> 17:43.575
No, that's the only
way in. Why?

17:43.643 --> 17:45.609
I think I have a faster way

17:45.677 --> 17:46.810
to get us back online,

17:46.878 --> 17:48.645
but Haynam says
it's too dangerous.

17:48.712 --> 17:51.013
I think he's
a raging egomaniac.

17:51.080 --> 17:54.048
Seems to be a prerequisite
for engineers these days.

17:54.116 --> 17:56.083
You talk to Hastings?

17:56.151 --> 17:58.118
If I tell Hastings,
he'll just shoot me down.

17:58.186 --> 18:00.086
Maybe not.
And maybe the moon will fall

18:00.154 --> 18:01.187
from the sky.

18:01.255 --> 18:02.522
Just let it go.

18:02.589 --> 18:04.423
These NSA guys seem to know
what they're doing.

18:04.491 --> 18:06.425
And if they don't,
what happens to Jack?

18:06.493 --> 18:07.859
What's Jack got
to do with this?

18:07.927 --> 18:09.928
(sighs)
Never mind.

18:19.402 --> 18:21.335
Hello?

18:21.403 --> 18:23.237
Renee, it's Chloe.
Where are you?

18:23.304 --> 18:24.538
I'm at Jack's apartment.

18:24.605 --> 18:25.572
What's going on?

18:25.640 --> 18:26.572
Everything.

18:27.706 --> 18:29.472
All of our systems
CTU was hit bare down.

18:29.540 --> 18:30.506
It's a real mess.

18:30.574 --> 18:31.807
How did that happen?

18:31.875 --> 18:33.275
I can't go into it right now,

18:33.343 --> 18:34.609
but we think
the terrorists were trying

18:34.677 --> 18:35.744
to take out
our radiological detectors.

18:35.811 --> 18:37.144
Where's Jack?

18:37.212 --> 18:38.646
That's why I'm calling you.
I think he might be

18:38.714 --> 18:40.113
in some kind of trouble.
We need to find him.

18:40.181 --> 18:41.447
Slow down, Chloe.

18:41.515 --> 18:43.082
Uh, what-what do you mean?
What-what kind of trouble?

18:43.083 --> 18:45.350
Jack was tracking the terrorists
when the EMP hit.

18:45.418 --> 18:47.819
Uh, whHe called NSA, mean?
and they lost contact, too.

18:47.886 --> 18:49.486
Does Hastings know
about this?

18:49.554 --> 18:51.054
He's the one
who told me.

18:51.121 --> 18:53.055
What's he doing about it?
Nothing.

18:53.123 --> 18:55.057
He won't send anyone out
to look for them.

18:55.124 --> 18:56.491
He says he can't
spare the men

18:56.559 --> 18:58.293
and that Jack can take
care of himself.

18:58.360 --> 19:00.294
Where was Jack
before you lost contact?

19:00.362 --> 19:03.196
He took the first exit
off the Williamsburg Bridge.

19:03.264 --> 19:04.931
I'm going to try
to find him, Chloe.

19:04.999 --> 19:06.900
You need to get CTU back online
as soon as you can.

19:06.967 --> 19:08.268
Once you acquire
Jack's position,

19:08.335 --> 19:09.569
you can direct me to him.

19:09.637 --> 19:10.937
Yeah, well, that might
take a while.

19:11.004 --> 19:12.571
NSA brought in
a repair team

19:12.639 --> 19:14.006
and they're going
about it all wrong.

19:14.073 --> 19:15.907
I have a faster way
to get us back online.

19:15.975 --> 19:16.941
Well, then tell them.

19:17.009 --> 19:18.609
I tried.
They won't listen.

19:18.677 --> 19:20.243
Then you need to make
them listen, Chloe.

19:20.311 --> 19:21.544
Do what you have to do.

19:24.581 --> 19:26.514
Okay. I will.

19:26.582 --> 19:28.582
Call me when you're back up.

19:49.550 --> 19:51.485
The EMP took out
all of our systems.

19:51.553 --> 19:53.453
And since we don't know
how long it's going to be

19:53.521 --> 19:54.855
until we're up
and running again,

19:54.923 --> 19:57.257
we're going to have to evacuate
all nonessential personnel.

19:57.325 --> 19:58.492
You're going to follow
Agent Combs

19:58.559 --> 20:00.093
through our access tunnel.
I need to speak

20:00.161 --> 20:01.495
with Mr. Prady, please.

20:01.562 --> 20:02.997
Thank you.

20:03.064 --> 20:05.065
Please.
Yeah.

20:10.072 --> 20:13.176
I'm really sorry that it took me
so long to get back to you.

20:13.243 --> 20:14.611
I've been a little busy.

20:14.679 --> 20:16.314
I know. They briefed me
on what happened.

20:16.381 --> 20:17.515
It's a terrible thing.

20:17.583 --> 20:18.987
Yes.

20:19.055 --> 20:21.027
And I have some bad news
because of it.

20:21.095 --> 20:23.532
The surveillance video
that you wanted

20:23.600 --> 20:26.704
has been erased
by the EMP.

20:26.772 --> 20:28.743
Erased?
Yes.

20:28.810 --> 20:30.981
Everything in the building
has been fried.

20:31.049 --> 20:33.483
Well, that's a damn shame.

20:33.551 --> 20:37.155
So what you're telling me is
whoever helped Kevin Wade

20:37.222 --> 20:39.590
rob that evidence locker--
they just caught a huge break.

20:39.657 --> 20:41.395
I'm afraid so.

20:41.463 --> 20:44.802
Are you sure that it was
all erased, Ms. Walsh?

20:44.869 --> 20:46.303
I mean, don't you have
a backup system?

20:46.371 --> 20:48.173
Yes, yes, we do,
but it's on-site.

20:48.240 --> 20:50.708
And like I told you, all the
servers have been wiped clean.

20:51.913 --> 20:54.618
I know how much
Kevin means to you.

20:54.685 --> 20:57.354
I really wish
I could do more.

20:57.422 --> 21:00.626
So you're sure that there's
nothing else you can tell me?

21:00.694 --> 21:02.262
Anything that would
help me find Kevin?

21:02.329 --> 21:04.297
Believe me, I have told you
everything that I know.

21:04.365 --> 21:06.632
I'm sure you have.

21:06.700 --> 21:09.336
Mr. Prady, I really have
to get back to work.

21:09.404 --> 21:11.039
Good luck

21:11.107 --> 21:12.808
finding Kevin.
I hope that he's okay.

21:12.875 --> 21:14.709
Me, too.

21:14.777 --> 21:16.845
If anything changes
with those files,

21:16.912 --> 21:18.512
I'll be in Little Rock.
You have my number.

21:18.580 --> 21:19.847
Of course.

21:21.148 --> 21:22.882
I hope you get your lights
back on.

21:58.018 --> 22:01.219
Mr. Haynam, I think
I found a way to deal

22:01.287 --> 22:03.254
with the safety concerns
you had with my idea.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.456
Here's the workaround.

22:05.524 --> 22:06.757
I thought I made myselear.

22:06.825 --> 22:09.092
We're not going anywhere
near that trunk line.

22:11.361 --> 22:13.395
I'm going to ask you
one last time.

22:13.463 --> 22:16.464
We really need
to do this my way.

22:16.531 --> 22:17.865
We have agents in the field
who are close to finding

22:17.933 --> 22:19.600
the nuclear rods
and they need our help.

22:19.667 --> 22:20.901
And I'm going to ask you
one last time.

22:20.968 --> 22:22.068
Get out of here.

22:22.136 --> 22:25.137
Get out or I'll
call security!

22:27.374 --> 22:28.474
You get out.

22:28.542 --> 22:30.242
Now.
What the hell...

22:30.310 --> 22:31.610
All of you, get out now.

22:31.678 --> 22:34.946
Look, look,
take a second to think.

22:35.014 --> 22:37.481
Do you really want to do this?

22:37.549 --> 22:40.417
Mr. Haynam,
I don't want to hurt you.

22:40.485 --> 22:41.818
You're probably

22:41.886 --> 22:43.019
an okay guy
when you're not at work.

22:43.087 --> 22:45.288
And you're wearing
a wedding ring.

22:45.356 --> 22:46.622
I swear to God,
if you don't leave right now,

22:46.690 --> 22:49.458
I will shoot you.

22:51.127 --> 22:52.461
Get out!

22:52.528 --> 22:55.463
Go!

23:09.243 --> 23:13.144
Go get Hastings and tell him
to bring security.

23:30.396 --> 23:31.931
They're starting to flank us!

23:31.999 --> 23:33.899
We're almost there!

23:36.937 --> 23:39.004
Jack, they're almost on us.
We cannot stay here!

23:39.072 --> 23:40.472
Just give me one more second.

23:42.608 --> 23:44.609
Okay...

23:44.677 --> 23:46.310
Okay, I'm ready.

23:46.378 --> 23:47.778
We're gonna use these plates
to form a way

23:47.846 --> 23:49.012
so that we can make it
over to the call box.

23:49.080 --> 23:50.113
Remember, we need to move

23:50.180 --> 23:51.647
slow and steady.

23:51.715 --> 23:53.515
It is imperative that we
stick together for this to work.

23:53.583 --> 23:55.150
You understand?
Yes, sir.

23:55.218 --> 23:57.018
No matter how difficult
it gets out there,

23:57.085 --> 23:58.319
this armor is gonna protect us.

23:58.387 --> 23:59.486
You need to trust that.

23:59.554 --> 24:01.387
Yes, sir.
Yes. Okay.

24:01.455 --> 24:02.755
Cole, you're with Agent King.

24:02.822 --> 24:03.922
Owen, you're with me.

24:10.794 --> 24:12.661
Let's go!

24:26.271 --> 24:28.372
The armor's not gonna hold up.

24:28.439 --> 24:30.006
Yes, it is.

24:30.074 --> 24:31.608
Maintain formation.

24:36.213 --> 24:37.580
Can you get a shot?

24:37.647 --> 24:39.514
Not from this angle.

24:41.284 --> 24:43.084
It's not holding up.
We gotta go for it.

24:43.152 --> 24:44.919
Yes, it is. Slow down!

24:47.222 --> 24:49.056
We're almost there. Move!

24:49.123 --> 24:50.757
No!
No, no!

25:12.277 --> 25:14.578
(King groaning)

25:14.645 --> 25:16.580
There's nothing
we can do for him now.

25:16.647 --> 25:18.081
We can't just leave him there.

25:18.149 --> 25:19.449
I'm with Owen.
We don't leave our men behind.

25:19.517 --> 25:20.617
You try and bring him in
now, you're dead.

25:20.684 --> 25:21.751
They're trying to draw us out.

25:21.818 --> 25:23.218
Best thing
we can do for him

25:23.286 --> 25:25.387
is make it to the hard line
and try and call for help.

25:27.623 --> 25:29.256
We're almost there.

25:29.324 --> 25:31.391
You cover the north,
Owen the east.

25:31.459 --> 25:32.792
I can get there.

25:43.768 --> 25:44.968
Owen!
Owen!

25:45.035 --> 25:46.302
Cover him!

26:20.835 --> 26:22.568
I'm sorry.

26:22.636 --> 26:24.437
I couldn't leave him behind.

26:24.504 --> 26:25.771
You did great.

26:30.243 --> 26:32.076
Is he all right?

26:32.144 --> 26:33.311
Did he make it?

26:36.215 --> 26:38.449
Did he make it?!

26:38.517 --> 26:40.318
Yeah, he made it.

26:40.386 --> 26:43.421
Come on. Stay with me.

26:43.489 --> 26:45.756
Stay with me.
Jack, they're repositioning.

26:45.824 --> 26:47.959
Stay on them.

27:13.702 --> 27:14.968
Are you all right?
Yes.

27:15.036 --> 27:16.302
Are you sure?

27:16.370 --> 27:17.570
Yes, Mother, I'm okay.

27:23.509 --> 27:26.878
I'm so sorry, Father.

27:26.946 --> 27:30.215
(sobbing):
I'm so sorry.

27:33.920 --> 27:36.354
You were right
about Tarin.

27:36.422 --> 27:39.324
I should have listened to you.

27:39.391 --> 27:41.693
You are safe.

27:41.760 --> 27:43.194
That's what's important.

27:43.262 --> 27:45.562
Mr. President,

27:45.630 --> 27:48.497
CTU is preparing a subterranean
evacuation route.

27:48.565 --> 27:50.198
If there is
a radiological attack,

27:50.266 --> 27:51.700
you'll be shielded
underground.

27:51.768 --> 27:52.867
When do we leave?

27:52.935 --> 27:54.435
As soon as possible.

27:54.502 --> 27:55.735
President Taylor's waiting for
you with the other delegates.

27:57.137 --> 27:59.771
The files Mr. Hastings
requested are inside.

27:59.839 --> 28:01.740
Thank you, sir.

28:01.807 --> 28:04.808
Kayla, go with them.

28:15.116 --> 28:16.950
She's strong.

28:17.018 --> 28:19.685
She'll be all right.

28:19.753 --> 28:23.789
We almost lost her.

28:23.857 --> 28:26.891
And I... almost lost you.

28:29.665 --> 28:32.906
All for a peace agreement that
could fall apart at any moment.

28:32.973 --> 28:35.780
And it will only get
more difficult, Dalia.

28:35.848 --> 28:39.424
My enemies will be waiting
for me once we return home.

28:39.492 --> 28:42.360
Omar...

28:42.428 --> 28:44.027
Despite everything
that's happened,

28:44.095 --> 28:46.062
there's one thing
I've never doubted.

28:46.130 --> 28:50.303
That what you are doing here
is an absolute good.

28:50.371 --> 28:53.940
You have to be strong, too.

29:13.892 --> 29:15.359
We need to get in there fast

29:15.427 --> 29:17.295
before O'Brian
can do any more damage.

29:17.363 --> 29:20.206
I understand the situation,
Mr. Haynam.

29:22.243 --> 29:23.945
How long?

29:24.013 --> 29:26.116
I just need to drill
into the locking mechanism.

29:26.183 --> 29:27.652
It shouldn't take more
than a couple minutes.

29:27.719 --> 29:29.922
This woman is out of her mind.

29:29.990 --> 29:31.791
Where the hell do you find
these people, Hastings?

29:31.859 --> 29:33.294
I can't believe she
pulled a weapon on me.

29:33.362 --> 29:35.363
She was ready to use it, too.
I seriously doubt that.

29:35.431 --> 29:37.299
I'm sure she was
just trying to scare you.

29:37.366 --> 29:39.367
Yeah? Well, she did
a very good job.

29:40.603 --> 29:42.105
You wanted to see me, sir?

29:42.173 --> 29:44.307
Yes, O'Brian's going off
the deep end.

29:44.374 --> 29:46.709
She thinks she knows how to
get the CTU up and running.

29:46.776 --> 29:49.146
But she's locked herself
in the server room to do it.

29:49.214 --> 29:51.382
We'll be in there
in a few seconds.

29:51.449 --> 29:53.150
What's she trying to do?

29:53.218 --> 29:54.653
She's trying to tap directly
into the trunk line,

29:54.721 --> 29:55.789
which I don't have to tell you,

29:55.856 --> 29:57.327
is a catastrophe
waiting to happen,

30:33.397 --> 30:35.932
Stop what you're doing, Chloe!

30:36.000 --> 30:38.432
Let's see the gun.

30:38.500 --> 30:41.202
Okay, don't shoot or anything.

30:43.805 --> 30:45.072
I know what I did is crazy.

30:45.140 --> 30:46.540
I know I'm in a lot of trouble.

30:46.608 --> 30:47.541
You're damned right.

30:47.609 --> 30:48.675
I wouldn't have done it

30:48.743 --> 30:49.910
if I didn't think it could work.

30:49.977 --> 30:51.777
I'm almost done.
I just need ten more minutes.

30:51.845 --> 30:53.345
Get her out of here now.

30:53.413 --> 30:54.513
Do me a favor:
let me give the orders.

30:54.580 --> 30:56.414
She pulled a gun on me!
I know what she did.

30:56.482 --> 30:59.884
Now just shut up
and let me handle it.

30:59.951 --> 31:02.187
Chloe, what in the hell
were you thinking?

31:02.254 --> 31:05.223
Jack's looking for those nuclear
rods and he might need our help.

31:05.291 --> 31:07.025
I can get satellite
and comm back up.

31:07.093 --> 31:08.560
I just need to finish tapping
into that trunk line.

31:08.627 --> 31:09.627
I told Mr. Haynam,

31:09.695 --> 31:10.795
but he wouldn't listen.

31:10.862 --> 31:12.396
So I pulled a gun on him.

31:13.765 --> 31:16.099
I didn't want to.
I don't even like guns.

31:16.167 --> 31:20.670
Dana, what's your
take on this?

31:20.738 --> 31:22.872
Mr. Haynam is right.

31:22.940 --> 31:24.707
Tapping into the trunk
line is dangerous

31:24.775 --> 31:26.809
and there's no guarantee
that it'll work.

31:26.877 --> 31:28.644
What about Cole?
He could be in trouble.

31:28.712 --> 31:30.145
Aren't you worried about him?

31:30.212 --> 31:32.413
Yes, I am. That's why I can't
go along with your plan.

31:32.481 --> 31:33.747
It's reckless.

31:33.815 --> 31:34.915
I'm sorry, Chloe.

31:34.983 --> 31:36.182
You've never been
my biggest fan.

31:36.250 --> 31:38.451
Why start now?

31:38.518 --> 31:41.620
Look, it's not as dangerous
as they're saying.

31:41.688 --> 31:42.988
I've taken precautions.

31:43.055 --> 31:44.356
This can work.

31:44.423 --> 31:46.224
I just need ten minutes.

31:46.292 --> 31:50.561
If I can't get the systems
online by then, fine, arrest me.

31:50.629 --> 31:52.764
When you brought me
on for this job,

31:52.831 --> 31:54.832
you said it was because
I didn't think like anyone else.

31:54.900 --> 31:57.367
Ever since I got here,
I've been punished for that.

31:57.435 --> 31:59.502
I've been right
more than once today.

31:59.570 --> 32:00.770
I think I've proven myself

32:00.838 --> 32:02.505
and I think I deserve
that ten minutes.

32:09.445 --> 32:12.147
Ten minutes.

32:12.215 --> 32:13.481
Thank you, sir.

32:13.549 --> 32:15.717
You can't be serious about this.

32:15.785 --> 32:16.651
You need any help?

32:16.719 --> 32:18.252
No, just let me work.

32:20.521 --> 32:21.755
All right, let's give
the lady some space.

32:29.126 --> 32:31.561
That's all, gentlemen.

32:33.964 --> 32:36.498
You are making a huge mistake.

32:36.566 --> 32:39.134
Maybe, but I'm willing
to take that chance.

32:39.201 --> 32:40.735
O'Brian proved
herself today.

32:40.803 --> 32:43.738
I want to see what
she comes up with.

32:43.805 --> 32:46.173
I'd appreciate it if you
and your men would stand by.

32:49.544 --> 32:51.044
Yes?

32:51.112 --> 32:53.380
What is it? Sir, there's a man
here who wants to speak

32:53.447 --> 32:54.814
with you-- Bill Prady.

32:54.882 --> 32:56.716
He says
he's a probation officer.

32:56.784 --> 32:58.551
Probation officer?
From Arkansas, sir.

32:58.618 --> 33:00.485
What does he want?

33:00.553 --> 33:02.853
He didn't say.

33:02.921 --> 33:04.021
Put him in Holding 2.

33:04.089 --> 33:05.722
Tell him I'll be there
in 15 minutes.

33:05.790 --> 33:06.890
All right.

33:06.958 --> 33:08.358
Dana, stay here
in case O'Brian

33:08.425 --> 33:09.926
needs anything.
I'll be in my office.

33:09.993 --> 33:11.994
Yes, sir.

33:41.032 --> 33:42.967
Mr. Hastings, are you there?

33:43.035 --> 33:45.236
We're here, Chloe.
What's your status?

33:45.304 --> 33:46.538
I'm into the
trunk line.

33:46.605 --> 33:48.339
I'm about to activate
the bypass circuit.

33:48.407 --> 33:50.040
Okay, what can we expect?

33:50.108 --> 33:51.775
Well, if I don't
electrocute myself,

33:51.843 --> 33:54.143
some of our primary systems
should start booting up.

33:54.211 --> 33:56.547
All right,
whenever you're ready.

34:31.065 --> 34:32.199
We've got power to comm.

34:36.137 --> 34:38.804
And one of the sat links
is back online.

34:38.873 --> 34:40.806
All right, that's good enough.
Start looking for Bauer.

34:42.042 --> 34:43.609
Okay, Chloe, it's working.

34:43.677 --> 34:44.777
You all right?

34:44.844 --> 34:46.245
I just need a few more minutes.

34:46.313 --> 34:47.513
I'll be right there.
Okay.

34:47.580 --> 34:48.914
Mr. Hastings, one more thing.

34:48.981 --> 34:51.882
If you do locate Jack,
you need to call Renee Walker.

34:51.949 --> 34:53.050
Walker?

34:53.118 --> 34:54.618
She went out looking for him.

34:54.686 --> 34:56.119
She should be in the vicinity.

34:56.187 --> 34:58.121
Will do.

34:58.188 --> 35:01.190
Why don't you go see
if Miss O'Brian needs a hand?

35:03.059 --> 35:05.027
And be civil this time.

35:11.335 --> 35:13.436
Come on, Owen.
Stay with me.

35:18.642 --> 35:21.177
Stay with me.

35:23.580 --> 35:25.581
He's gone.

35:28.284 --> 35:30.819
I lost two
of the snipers.

35:30.886 --> 35:33.888
If we're gonna make a move,
we got to do it soon, Jack.

35:33.956 --> 35:36.357
We can't lay down cover fire
for something we can't see.

35:36.425 --> 35:38.392
We need to give them something
to shoot at.

35:38.460 --> 35:40.327
I'll make a break
to the north,

35:40.395 --> 35:42.628
try and draw their fire,
you make a run for the call box.

35:42.696 --> 35:44.396
But that's a suicide play, Jack.
You'll never make it.

35:44.464 --> 35:46.064
But you will.
No.

35:46.132 --> 35:47.332
I can't let you do that.

35:47.400 --> 35:48.599
I'm in command here.

35:48.667 --> 35:50.167
That's what gonna happen.

35:50.235 --> 35:51.869
Do you understand?

35:51.937 --> 35:54.208
Yeah.

35:55.280 --> 35:57.080
I need you to do me a favor.

35:57.148 --> 35:58.648
What is it?

35:58.716 --> 36:00.917
You make sure
that Hastings keeps his promise.

36:02.252 --> 36:04.353
That he doesn't
bring Renee back in.

36:04.421 --> 36:06.688
I give you my word.

36:06.756 --> 36:09.691
You're not gonna have long
before they start firing on you.

36:09.759 --> 36:11.493
Good luck, Jack.

36:11.560 --> 36:13.594
You make it to that call box.

37:12.314 --> 37:14.481
Clear!

37:29.424 --> 37:31.392
Jack? Jack?!

37:31.459 --> 37:32.559
Jack?
(gasps)

37:32.627 --> 37:33.994
It's okay.
It's okay. It's me.

37:34.061 --> 37:35.628
It's Renee.
It's okay.

37:35.696 --> 37:37.229
(groans)
It's okay.

37:37.297 --> 37:38.531
Shh.
(panting)

37:38.598 --> 37:40.599
They got the fuel rods
in a boat.

37:40.666 --> 37:43.067
They're heading
across the river into the city.

37:43.135 --> 37:44.769
I can't breathe.
Shh.

37:44.836 --> 37:46.470
It's okay.
Nothing went through.

37:48.073 --> 37:51.476
Relax. You may have
a collapsed lung...

37:51.543 --> 37:52.477
Jack, I got through to CTU.

37:52.545 --> 37:53.845
They just got back online.

37:53.913 --> 37:55.113
NYPD's sending choppers.

37:55.180 --> 37:56.380
We still got a real good shot
at finding them.

38:07.558 --> 38:10.026
Mr. Hastings, I just got
a call from Agent Ortiz.

38:10.093 --> 38:11.794
The nuclear rods
are on a Zodiac

38:11.862 --> 38:12.928
with two
of the terrorists aboard.

38:12.996 --> 38:14.329
They were heading northwest

38:14.397 --> 38:16.264
across the river toward the city.
Where are the choppers?

38:16.332 --> 38:17.699
One second.

38:18.734 --> 38:20.500
They just arrived at the port.

38:20.567 --> 38:21.467
Okay, redirect them.

38:21.535 --> 38:22.802
Start diverting
all available

38:22.869 --> 38:24.136
NYPD units to that shoreline.

38:24.204 --> 38:26.638
We need to lay down a cordon.
Yes, sir.

38:26.706 --> 38:28.739
Chloe?

38:29.874 --> 38:31.307
Thanks. You-You were...

38:31.375 --> 38:33.642
I'm not good with praise.

39:22.418 --> 39:26.220
What do you think you're doing,
going to my boss?

39:26.288 --> 39:28.154
My job.

39:28.222 --> 39:29.989
I've answered
all your questions.

39:30.057 --> 39:31.590
Why won't you just leave?

39:31.658 --> 39:33.024
I can't do that.

39:33.092 --> 39:34.993
I know you were involved with

39:35.060 --> 39:36.093
that robbery,
Ms. Walsh.

39:36.161 --> 39:37.228
What?

39:37.295 --> 39:38.762
I think you know
exactly where Kevin is.

39:38.830 --> 39:39.929
I think you're protecting him.

39:39.997 --> 39:42.331
You are out of your mind.

39:42.399 --> 39:43.533
And you're a liar.

39:43.600 --> 39:45.401
I'm not leaving here

39:45.469 --> 39:47.336
until I know the truth.

39:47.404 --> 39:50.105
This'll go a lot
smoother for you

39:50.172 --> 39:53.674
if you just come clean
right now.

39:53.742 --> 39:56.610
It's not too late,
Miss Walsh.

39:56.678 --> 39:59.513
But I promise you, if you don't,

39:59.580 --> 40:01.515
I'm gonna nail your ass

40:01.582 --> 40:03.516
to the wall.

41:11.947 --> 41:14.047
Contact CTU.

41:14.115 --> 41:16.818
See if they picked 'em up
going across the river.

41:33.466 --> 41:34.966
It's me.

41:35.034 --> 41:36.501
CTU's back online.

41:36.568 --> 41:38.769
I know. There are helicopters

41:38.836 --> 41:40.303
searching the river.

41:40.371 --> 41:42.337
They're getting close.

41:42.405 --> 41:44.072
You should have
warned us earlier.

41:44.139 --> 41:45.706
I didn't have time.

41:45.774 --> 41:47.741
I was too busy
preserving my cover.

41:47.808 --> 41:51.310
I don't know how much longer
I'll be able to stay under.

41:51.378 --> 41:52.678
I thought
you took care of that problem.

41:52.745 --> 41:53.845
So did I.

41:53.913 --> 41:55.480
It came back.

41:55.547 --> 41:57.448
Well, we can't stay here.

41:57.516 --> 41:59.950
The police must already
be cordoning off the area.

42:00.018 --> 42:01.917
We're going to need your help
getting clear.

42:01.985 --> 42:03.583
I will get you
out of there.

42:03.650 --> 42:05.049
Don't worry.

42:05.117 --> 42:07.550
Stand by.
I'll call you in a few minutes.
