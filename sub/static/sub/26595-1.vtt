01:27.402 --> 01:30.794
Hello, Oliver, how are you?
How was your trip?

01:30.796 --> 01:33.710
Hi, Mama, I'm fine.
It's very hot here.

01:33.712 --> 01:37.627
Mama is very happy
to know you are safe.

01:37.629 --> 01:43.546
And how are the girls there?
Have you met anyone yet?

01:43.548 --> 01:45.896
No, not yet, Mama.

01:45.898 --> 01:50.249
How about the house?
Is everything set up?

01:50.251 --> 01:52.338
Do we have everything we need?

01:52.340 --> 01:55.036
Yes, Mama, everything's fine,
don't worry.

01:55.038 --> 01:57.996
Good, because it's time.

01:57.998 --> 02:02.826
And remember, darling,
next time dress code.

02:02.828 --> 02:05.742
Sorry, Mama. Sorry, Mama.

02:05.744 --> 02:09.311
Well, I don't want to keep you. Have a nice time.

02:09.312 --> 02:13.185
- Thank you.
- Be safe, talk to you later.

02:13.187 --> 02:14.577
Bye, Mama.

03:24.606 --> 03:26.736
Who's cat is that?

03:26.738 --> 03:28.129
How did you get in here?

03:28.131 --> 03:29.785
Do you know me?

03:30.786 --> 03:32.918
I don't want you here.

03:35.095 --> 03:38.183
Might be nice
to have some company.

03:38.185 --> 03:40.315
She wouldn't like it.

03:40.317 --> 03:43.059
She doesn't like
anything except...

04:36.417 --> 04:38.460
Maybe the cat's hungry?

04:38.462 --> 04:42.727
Cats don't eat bread,
they eat meat.

08:54.675 --> 08:57.634
Hey! Handsome man,
where you go?

09:53.473 --> 09:55.211
Just go and tell her
she's pretty.

09:55.213 --> 09:57.431
Girls like that.

09:57.433 --> 10:00.173
They like it when
you tell them they're pretties.

10:00.175 --> 10:02.392
Just get up.

10:02.394 --> 10:04.394
Go over there and if you
tell her she is pretty,

10:04.396 --> 10:06.614
she is gonna like that.

10:06.616 --> 10:08.226
Yeah, she is pretty.

10:31.075 --> 10:34.250
You... you are very pretty.

10:34.252 --> 10:36.472
You're not.

10:41.651 --> 10:45.218
I may not be pretty
but I have what you need.

10:45.220 --> 10:48.179
And what do I need?

10:51.531 --> 10:54.446
To wake up and have a good time.

10:58.538 --> 11:02.629
You're gonna wake me up, huh?
How you gonna do that?

11:07.024 --> 11:10.069
Come back,
come back, come back to my place

11:10.071 --> 11:15.555
and then, and then, and then,
then we can do a little drugs.

11:19.602 --> 11:23.084
You don't look like the type
of person who does drugs.

11:25.652 --> 11:27.567
Look, look at me.

11:30.439 --> 11:32.265
Of course, I do drugs.

11:39.753 --> 11:42.625
OK, you nutter,
come on, let's go.

11:47.108 --> 11:51.155
This is my room... this is
my room, you can come in.

11:56.160 --> 11:58.334
What the fuck happened
to your mirror?

11:58.336 --> 12:03.383
Oh, yeah, um,
yeah, you should sit. Sit.

12:03.385 --> 12:05.909
OK, OK, OK, OK.

12:38.289 --> 12:39.813
Well, then?

12:52.608 --> 12:55.263
Here's the drugs.
You can get started.

12:58.788 --> 13:00.529
You should get started.

13:03.227 --> 13:04.531
Oh, you have a cat?

13:04.533 --> 13:05.708
Cat?

13:07.362 --> 13:08.404
Whoa.

13:11.758 --> 13:13.673
I guess I do have a cat.

13:42.745 --> 13:46.183
Oh, your fucking fan, man.
Sort it out.

14:25.701 --> 14:28.051
Whoa, you're moving too fast.

14:36.451 --> 14:38.279
What are you doing?

14:40.847 --> 14:44.500
OK, play music. Whatever.

14:51.858 --> 14:54.034
Mama wants to watch.

14:55.296 --> 14:58.210
Well, hello there, darling.

14:58.212 --> 15:00.995
What the fuck, is that your Mum?

15:00.997 --> 15:02.562
Yeah, that's Mama.

15:02.564 --> 15:05.391
Not feeling very well
are we, sweetie?

15:05.393 --> 15:08.394
What the fuck? I'm outta here
you fucking weirdos.

15:08.396 --> 15:11.703
- I wish you could.
- You dirty little cunt.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.538
What did you give me?

15:57.053 --> 15:59.619
Oh, you're still here,
you little whore.

15:59.621 --> 16:03.492
We thought you were leaving.
Shame you didn't make it.

16:05.018 --> 16:07.194
Do you know why
we didn't let you go?

16:09.196 --> 16:10.630
Come on, speak up.

16:10.632 --> 16:13.111
Please stop...

16:16.638 --> 16:20.596
I can't understand your stupid fucking face.

16:20.598 --> 16:22.426
Please let me go.

16:23.863 --> 16:26.864
Stop crying, you little bitch.

16:33.437 --> 16:37.700
- Let me go.
- Oliver, fuck that bitch.

16:37.702 --> 16:39.964
Wreck her for Mama.

16:39.966 --> 16:42.618
Come on, wreck her,
wreck her, wreck her.

16:42.620 --> 16:43.924
Wreck her for Mama.

16:45.319 --> 16:49.625
...you fucking freaks.

16:49.627 --> 16:54.282
- Wreck her, wreck her. Fuck that bitch.
- No.

16:54.284 --> 16:56.197
Wreck her for Mama. Come on.

16:56.199 --> 16:58.071
Wreck her, wreck her.

17:04.555 --> 17:07.295
Wreck her. Wreck her for Mama.

17:07.297 --> 17:09.079
Please, let me go.

17:09.082 --> 17:11.171
Open, her eyes, Oliver.

17:12.737 --> 17:15.564
Stick it in her
smelly little ass.

17:19.005 --> 17:22.223
Peek a boo, I see you.

17:22.224 --> 17:24.747
Peek a boo, peek a boo.

17:26.882 --> 17:29.798
I am having so much fun.

17:33.323 --> 17:36.020
Knock, knock. Who's there?

17:36.022 --> 17:38.718
Fucked. Fucked who?

17:38.720 --> 17:42.289
You, fucking you. Haha. You.

17:44.073 --> 17:47.205
Oliver, fuck her, fuck her,
fuck her, fuck her, fuck her.

17:47.207 --> 17:49.685
Fuck harder.
Fuck her, you idiot.

17:49.687 --> 17:54.910
Fuck her, fuck her, fuck her, harder,
harder, harder, harder, harder.

17:57.304 --> 17:59.219
Oliver, fuck her.

18:01.134 --> 18:04.396
Stop. Oliver, stop!

18:04.398 --> 18:07.401
Oh!

18:10.143 --> 18:11.971
At least she's still twitching.

18:13.363 --> 18:15.931
Twitchy little cunt.

18:17.846 --> 18:21.979
OK, Oliver. Mama's tired.

18:21.981 --> 18:24.111
Next time wait a little longer.

18:24.113 --> 18:26.722
OK, Mama. Sorry, Mama, sorry.

18:26.724 --> 18:30.813
Well, it was short but fun.
Could have been better.

18:30.815 --> 18:33.425
Now clean up your mess
and go to bed.

18:33.427 --> 18:36.080
Sweet dreams.
Mama loves you.

18:36.082 --> 18:37.866
Night, Mama, night.

18:46.222 --> 18:48.659
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18:49.834 --> 18:53.314
I didn't,
I didn't want to do that.

18:53.316 --> 18:57.625
She made me, she made me.
I didn't want to do that.

19:00.541 --> 19:05.761
I... I didn't hate you.
I didn't hate you.

19:05.763 --> 19:10.331
Look at me, look at me.
I didn't hate you.

19:10.333 --> 19:12.464
I did it really fast.

19:12.466 --> 19:16.165
A lot quicker then she wanted me
to do it. A lot quicker.

19:21.605 --> 19:26.565
If I hadn't found you
and ended you when I did,

19:26.567 --> 19:29.831
the drugs would have done it,
but slower.

19:34.357 --> 19:36.620
How could you
do that to your mother?

22:44.808 --> 22:46.332
Hi.

22:47.855 --> 22:50.553
I had the craziest
dream last night.

22:52.338 --> 22:53.730
Do you wanna hear about it?

22:56.255 --> 22:58.994
OK, so I was on this ship.

22:58.996 --> 23:02.737
It was like a cruise ship
but it wasn't really that fancy,

23:02.739 --> 23:04.348
so maybe it wasn't
a cruise ship.

23:04.350 --> 23:06.088
But everyone
was dressed really fancy

23:06.090 --> 23:07.568
and I was dressed in rags.

23:07.570 --> 23:09.527
The only way I knew
how to get off this ship

23:09.529 --> 23:13.270
was to jump over board,
so I did.

23:13.272 --> 23:17.885
Anyway, I was in the water
and I was so happy.

23:18.973 --> 23:20.364
And then
the craziest thing happened,

23:20.366 --> 23:23.192
my tooth fell out.

23:23.194 --> 23:24.803
It's really strange,

23:24.805 --> 23:27.936
and then I saw a piano
at the bottom of the ocean,

23:27.938 --> 23:29.982
playing the most
beautiful music.

23:29.984 --> 23:34.203
- Piano?
- Yeah, a piano.

23:34.205 --> 23:35.772
Why are you lying?

23:37.165 --> 23:38.730
I'm not lying.

23:38.732 --> 23:41.256
No piano, no music.

23:43.693 --> 23:46.259
Why would I lie?

23:46.261 --> 23:48.089
Yeah, why would you lie?

23:52.049 --> 23:54.182
How did you know I was lying?

23:56.053 --> 23:59.318
I used to take piano lessons
when I was a child.

24:01.407 --> 24:03.626
My mother made me take it.

24:05.628 --> 24:07.500
I always hated it.

24:09.458 --> 24:13.721
Yeah, that's what happens
when you are a kid.

24:13.723 --> 24:16.291
You have to do these things
you don't want to do.

25:43.247 --> 25:44.943
- Hi, Oliver.
- Hi, Mama.

25:44.945 --> 25:46.292
Did you take some time
to think about

25:46.294 --> 25:47.511
what you did last night?

25:47.513 --> 25:48.729
Sorry, Mama.

25:48.731 --> 25:52.907
Very messy, Oliver, very messy.

25:52.909 --> 25:57.085
- Won't happen again.
- Did we dispose of that trashy cunt?

25:57.087 --> 26:01.829
We don't want to have
any more problems, do we?

26:01.831 --> 26:05.050
No, Mama. I sorted it, Mama.
I'm sorry.

26:05.052 --> 26:10.185
Good boy. Mama is tired today.
We need some rest.

26:10.187 --> 26:12.884
- OK.
- Bye-bye.

27:24.174 --> 27:27.001
This is my story.

27:27.003 --> 27:31.615
See little, little Oli
was happy and brave,

27:31.617 --> 27:35.488
but little Oli,
he was raised by monsters.

27:35.490 --> 27:37.577
A mommy monster
and a daddy monster.

27:37.579 --> 27:39.623
But little Oli,
he didn't want to,

27:39.625 --> 27:42.192
he didn't want to grow up
to be a monster.

27:43.933 --> 27:47.631
And one day, daddy monster,

27:47.633 --> 27:50.459
daddy monster
hurt him really bad.

27:50.461 --> 27:53.506
Daddy monster burned him,
burned him up.

27:53.508 --> 27:57.989
But mommy monster,
she saved him and killed daddy.

27:57.991 --> 27:59.730
You see, he's dead there.

27:59.732 --> 28:04.127
And, uh, they lived
happily ever after.

28:05.520 --> 28:08.260
No, they didn't.

28:08.262 --> 28:12.873
What do you think?
What do you think?

28:12.875 --> 28:15.484
They didn't live
happily ever after, did they?

28:15.486 --> 28:17.706
But this is my story.

28:19.142 --> 28:20.622
Yeah.

29:24.251 --> 29:26.688
Have you had anymore dreams?

29:31.737 --> 29:33.913
Yeah, again.

29:34.914 --> 29:37.090
This time I was tied to a chair.

29:40.310 --> 29:42.486
Do you think it means anything?

29:46.099 --> 29:47.535
Maybe.

29:50.103 --> 29:51.408
Maybe.

30:03.246 --> 30:04.639
That's better.

30:07.990 --> 30:13.472
I like this park,
it's just relaxing.

30:19.393 --> 30:21.959
Are you leaving again?

30:21.961 --> 30:23.832
Yeah, I got to go.

30:26.792 --> 30:28.707
I'm Sophia.

30:32.275 --> 30:34.667
My name is Oliver.

30:34.669 --> 30:36.932
Nice to meet you, Oliver.

31:15.579 --> 31:18.537
Hi, Oliver. How was your day?

31:18.539 --> 31:20.321
Yeah, it was nice, I went to a...

31:20.323 --> 31:23.847
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Do you need anything?

31:23.849 --> 31:26.675
Because I don't
need you tonight.

31:26.677 --> 31:28.808
Can I ask you a question, Mama?

31:28.810 --> 31:30.943
What is it? I'm busy.

31:32.074 --> 31:34.292
Do you have dreams?

31:34.294 --> 31:36.339
Fuck you!

31:37.471 --> 31:39.950
Weirdo.

31:45.479 --> 31:46.959
Sophia.

32:07.022 --> 32:09.111
What's, what is your name?

32:27.564 --> 32:31.438
Sophia. Your name is Sophia.

32:33.222 --> 32:34.920
It's a nice name.

32:36.573 --> 32:38.356
I know it sounds really silly

32:38.358 --> 32:40.575
but I want to pretend
that we are on a corny date

32:40.577 --> 32:42.664
like everyone else here.

32:42.666 --> 32:45.754
I want something good today.

32:45.756 --> 32:47.976
I have something for you first.

32:48.977 --> 32:50.631
- For me?
- Yeah.

32:51.850 --> 32:53.547
Hold out your arm.

33:55.304 --> 33:57.393
I really like the bracelet.

33:59.569 --> 34:00.960
Thank you.

34:00.962 --> 34:02.616
You're welcome.

34:08.317 --> 34:10.447
Sophia?

34:10.449 --> 34:11.929
Yes?

34:18.588 --> 34:23.942
I was thinking today,
I was going to go on the boats.

34:27.728 --> 34:29.771
Do you want to come?

34:29.773 --> 34:33.558
- With you?
- Yeah.

34:33.560 --> 34:35.344
I'd like that.

34:46.485 --> 34:48.487
So when do you want to go?

34:52.840 --> 34:56.014
OK, we...
we could go now. Now.

34:56.016 --> 34:57.149
Yeah.

34:58.237 --> 34:59.629
OK.

35:07.637 --> 35:09.811
First time
I've been in one of these.

35:09.813 --> 35:12.686
Me too. It's exciting.

35:15.732 --> 35:18.300
Tell me something
about yourself.

35:21.651 --> 35:24.261
Can't think of anything.

35:24.263 --> 35:27.133
Like, what do you like?

35:27.135 --> 35:28.656
I don't know.

35:28.658 --> 35:31.183
Come on.
There's got to be something.

35:33.446 --> 35:34.708
Uh...

35:39.582 --> 35:43.369
I think... I think I like cats.

35:44.631 --> 35:47.284
You think?

35:47.286 --> 35:53.551
A cat came to visit. I like it.

35:53.553 --> 35:59.644
It comes, it goes and it doesn't
ask me to do anything.

35:59.646 --> 36:01.689
I like that.

36:01.691 --> 36:04.083
Does the cat have a name?

36:04.085 --> 36:05.954
No.

36:05.956 --> 36:09.308
It should have a name.
You should think about it.

38:42.983 --> 38:44.983
Today's been a good day.

38:44.985 --> 38:46.900
Yeah, it's been nice.

38:47.944 --> 38:49.553
But I got to go.

38:49.555 --> 38:51.859
So soon?

38:51.861 --> 38:55.602
But I'll be back tomorrow.
So see you tomorrow.

38:55.604 --> 38:58.172
- Bye.
- Bye.

39:00.609 --> 39:04.874
- Bye, Oliver.
- Bye, Sophia.

39:08.791 --> 39:11.357
You can go now, Oliver.

39:11.359 --> 39:12.882
Yeah, I'll go now.

39:18.758 --> 39:22.368
Mama, I don't want
to do this anymore.

39:22.370 --> 39:26.111
You, you, you know
what I mean, the killing.

39:26.113 --> 39:28.898
It's not who I am,
it's who you are.

39:30.378 --> 39:34.206
I'm... I'm sorry but I don't
want to do this anymore.

39:34.208 --> 39:36.991
You...
you can't tell me what to do.

39:36.993 --> 39:39.385
I'm not,
I'm not a little boy anymore.

39:39.387 --> 39:43.302
I'm a man. I met someone.

39:43.304 --> 39:47.003
I like her and she likes me.

39:48.875 --> 39:52.964
This... this...
this has to stop.

39:52.966 --> 39:58.361
I... I still love you,
but I won't do this anymore.

39:58.363 --> 40:02.495
It's wrong what you make me do.

40:02.497 --> 40:06.545
I have a cat and a girlfriend.

40:07.589 --> 40:09.850
She... she might even love me.

40:09.852 --> 40:13.419
Why? She can, she could.

40:13.421 --> 40:16.117
She could,
I could be like everyone else.

40:16.119 --> 40:18.990
I could...
I could be like everyone else.

40:18.992 --> 40:25.518
No, no, no, I don't have to listen
to your bad words anymore, Mama.

40:25.520 --> 40:29.872
No, goodbye, Mama.
Goodbye, Mama.

41:15.918 --> 41:17.178
Hello, Oliver.

41:17.180 --> 41:19.659
- Hello, Mama.
- How are you?

41:19.661 --> 41:22.140
Yeah, I'm good,
I want to talk about something.

41:22.142 --> 41:25.317
- Why are you dressed?
- I want to talk, Mama.

41:25.319 --> 41:26.884
What's with the hair?

41:26.886 --> 41:28.581
I like, I like the hair.

41:28.583 --> 41:32.759
What is that fucking garbage
on your wrist?

41:32.761 --> 41:35.458
I found it.

41:35.460 --> 41:37.373
- Really?
- I found it.

41:37.375 --> 41:43.857
We found it.
Hm. So, so interesting.

41:43.859 --> 41:48.253
One man's trash
is another man's treasure.

41:48.255 --> 41:49.950
Yeah, true Mama, true.

41:49.952 --> 41:53.214
I don't like it, get rid of it.

41:53.216 --> 41:54.651
Take it off.

41:56.350 --> 41:58.045
Yes, Mama, I am.

41:58.047 --> 42:01.701
I'm going to take it off.
I'm going to take it off.

42:01.703 --> 42:05.488
So why are we still dressed?

42:05.490 --> 42:07.359
Don't... [indistinct] Mama.

42:07.361 --> 42:09.361
- I'm trying to take it off.
- Take it off.

42:09.363 --> 42:10.449
I am.

42:10.451 --> 42:13.017
Take it all off!

42:13.019 --> 42:15.715
It's off. Everything.

42:15.717 --> 42:17.717
I don't want to
do this tonight, Mama.

42:17.719 --> 42:19.371
- I don't want to.
- Keep going.

42:19.373 --> 42:24.507
I am, I am.
I'm taking it off for you.

42:24.509 --> 42:26.204
Take it off.

42:26.206 --> 42:31.252
- Yes, Mama, I am taking it.
- Go on. Take it off.

42:31.254 --> 42:33.472
I am.

42:33.474 --> 42:38.042
And now be a sweet boy, show
Mama how much you love her.

42:38.044 --> 42:39.652
No, Mama.

42:39.654 --> 42:43.656
Come on, give Mama some sugar.

42:43.658 --> 42:47.399
- I don't like this, Mama.
- You dirty little fucker.

42:47.401 --> 42:49.096
I'm not, you make me.

42:49.098 --> 42:52.752
Faster, faster, keep going.

42:52.754 --> 42:55.235
Show Mama how much
you love her.

42:57.890 --> 43:02.980
Please, please, I don't want to.

43:02.982 --> 43:04.547
That's my boy.

43:04.549 --> 43:07.508
- Come on. Faster.
- I am!

43:08.988 --> 43:11.858
Come on,
you dirty little motherfucker.

43:11.860 --> 43:17.255
Make Mama happy.
You little cunt.

43:17.257 --> 43:22.695
Faster, cunt, faster, faster.

43:22.697 --> 43:24.958
You stupid little twat.

43:24.960 --> 43:26.440
I'm not.

43:27.397 --> 43:29.572
Finish it, come on,

43:29.574 --> 43:34.230
Finish it off. Faster, faster.

43:35.231 --> 43:36.666
Oh!

43:36.668 --> 43:38.319
You came all over yourself.

43:38.321 --> 43:40.757
Good boy.

43:40.759 --> 43:44.630
- Now go and clean yourself up. Get dressed.
- I will.

43:44.632 --> 43:49.026
And find us
an Asian slant cunted slut.

43:49.028 --> 43:51.639
Mama wants some action tonight.

43:55.730 --> 43:58.514
- Stop fucking crying.
- I'm not crying.

43:58.516 --> 44:02.607
- Go on. Now!
- I am!

44:17.578 --> 44:21.713
Disgusting... disgusting.

44:34.856 --> 44:36.249
Hi.

44:38.643 --> 44:41.123
I need you to come back
to my place.

44:42.124 --> 44:44.255
Over there.

44:44.257 --> 44:45.737
OK.

45:15.680 --> 45:18.639
Shh!

45:29.737 --> 45:33.478
Oliver, is she pissing?

45:33.480 --> 45:35.219
Yes, Mama.

45:35.221 --> 45:38.398
Oh, I wish I could smell her.

45:40.008 --> 45:45.272
Nice work, Oliver,
she's a real beauty.

45:45.274 --> 45:51.063
Spin her around,
I want to see her asshole.

46:04.598 --> 46:06.424
Tight, tight.

46:06.426 --> 46:09.951
Oliver this is
going to hurt her.

46:11.039 --> 46:13.387
You're in for a real treat.

46:15.130 --> 46:18.044
I don't think she ever
had it up her ass before.

46:18.046 --> 46:23.356
Spin her around, I want to see her fucking face.

46:36.761 --> 46:40.503
Long time no see, cunt.

46:42.941 --> 46:48.771
Oliver, tear up that tight,
little Asian ass for Mama.

46:48.773 --> 46:54.343
Me so horny,
me love you long time.

47:00.132 --> 47:04.658
Oliver? Oliver are you OK?

47:09.097 --> 47:11.621
Maybe we should
go get ice cream.

47:16.975 --> 47:19.151
Did I do something wrong?

47:20.282 --> 47:22.067
No.

47:23.633 --> 47:28.898
I've been in such
a dark place for so many years

47:28.900 --> 47:32.207
and something's put the light
back into my life.

47:34.557 --> 47:39.693
I knew a girl who was in a very
dark place for a very long time.

47:40.912 --> 47:42.825
She never had a normal life.

47:42.827 --> 47:44.609
She didn't know her parents,

47:44.611 --> 47:48.308
she didn't have any friends,
she didn't go to school.

47:48.310 --> 47:54.967
She had this family,
this really big family,

47:54.969 --> 47:58.666
but they weren't
really her family.

47:58.668 --> 48:02.107
They weren't very nice to her,
at all.

48:09.288 --> 48:10.898
Was she in a cult?

48:12.944 --> 48:16.774
Yes, but she didn't know it.

48:19.037 --> 48:23.041
How're you supposed to know things
if you've never known anything else?

48:24.520 --> 48:28.786
You just accept things
that you shouldn't.

48:32.572 --> 48:34.617
What sort of things?

48:37.359 --> 48:40.188
Things that should
never happen to children.

48:45.933 --> 48:47.543
What did she do?

48:49.023 --> 48:51.632
Well, even though
she didn't know any different,

48:51.634 --> 48:54.244
she always hoped
that things could be better.

48:54.246 --> 48:58.857
So, eventually, she escaped.

48:58.859 --> 49:02.341
But it wasn't easy
because she was alone.

49:04.996 --> 49:07.694
How, how is she now?

49:09.565 --> 49:11.132
Well...

49:18.183 --> 49:19.924
she's not alone anymore.

49:26.060 --> 49:28.582
I'm so sorry,
I'm gonna have to go.

49:28.584 --> 49:31.063
- Please, just stay a little longer.
- I can't, I can't,

49:31.065 --> 49:32.501
I wish I could.

49:36.418 --> 49:38.029
I'll see you tomorrow.

51:07.248 --> 51:09.901
You're late.
Where have you been?

51:09.903 --> 51:11.990
Mama's been worried about you.

51:11.992 --> 51:13.949
Why are you dressed again?

51:13.951 --> 51:15.385
I was... I forgot my camera.

51:15.387 --> 51:16.821
I was at the park
but I got it back.

51:16.823 --> 51:18.649
Oliver, look at Mama,

51:18.651 --> 51:20.216
tell Mama the truth.

51:20.218 --> 51:22.914
I was at the park then I forgot.

51:22.916 --> 51:28.398
Why are you wearing that fucking garbage that you found?

51:28.400 --> 51:29.442
I met a girl.

51:29.444 --> 51:31.836
Oh, you found us a girl.

51:31.838 --> 51:35.100
- Why didn't you say so?
- No, it's not like that.

51:35.102 --> 51:37.755
I like her,
she makes me really happy.

51:37.757 --> 51:39.452
She makes you happy.

51:39.454 --> 51:45.154
Oliver is happy, how cute.
Oh...

51:45.156 --> 51:47.547
I think I might love her.

51:47.549 --> 51:50.594
No, you love Mama.

51:50.596 --> 51:53.162
You know we can't
have her in our lives.

51:53.164 --> 51:54.946
This is different,
she is different.

51:54.948 --> 51:57.209
I think she might
actually love me, too.

51:57.211 --> 52:00.908
Oliver, you're breaking
my fucking heart.

52:00.910 --> 52:03.172
Do you want me to fucking die?

52:03.174 --> 52:06.871
You know you will never find anyone to love and take care of you like Mama.

52:06.873 --> 52:09.656
Do you really think
I would let some whore come in

52:09.658 --> 52:11.528
and destroy everything, do you?

52:11.530 --> 52:14.096
No, Mama.

52:14.098 --> 52:16.491
Love...

52:18.885 --> 52:21.016
She loves you, does she?

52:21.018 --> 52:24.628
Then she must know
everything about you.

52:24.630 --> 52:27.761
She must know what you
do to all those girls.

52:27.763 --> 52:31.243
She must know
that you hunt them, beat them,

52:31.245 --> 52:36.944
torture them, rape them, drug
them and then you kill them.

52:36.946 --> 52:42.733
All those poor little girls.

52:42.735 --> 52:48.869
She must know you're a motherfucker.
You re a monster.

52:48.871 --> 52:50.828
No, she doesn't know.

52:50.830 --> 52:53.265
You really haven't thought
this thing through, have you?

52:53.267 --> 52:57.228
- No, Mama.
- Bring this little lover to Mama.

52:58.925 --> 53:00.707
- OK, Mama.
- Now.

53:00.709 --> 53:04.624
- I'll go and get her now.
- You, monster fucker.

53:04.626 --> 53:05.888
OK, Mama.

53:58.027 --> 54:01.638
I got to find someone for Mama.
I got to find someone for Mama.

54:01.640 --> 54:03.596
I got to find someone for Mama.

54:03.598 --> 54:05.859
I got to go find someone
for Mama.

54:05.861 --> 54:08.037
I got to find someone for Mama.

54:20.659 --> 54:22.226
I gotta get someone...

54:43.464 --> 54:45.074
I gotta find someone.

55:10.317 --> 55:11.884
I gotta find her.

55:37.779 --> 55:39.085
You're dead.

55:42.393 --> 55:45.047
La-la-la-la-la!

55:49.530 --> 55:51.487
Fuck her, Oliver,
come on, fuck her.

55:51.489 --> 55:53.010
Fuck her, fuck her...

55:53.012 --> 55:56.058
Fuck that bitch.
You little cunt.

56:17.732 --> 56:19.776
I got money, I got money.

56:19.778 --> 56:23.127
I need girlfriend tonight,
one night. I got money.

56:23.129 --> 56:25.434
- Fuck off.
- I got money, for you,

56:25.436 --> 56:27.871
you can have it and come to
my house because I've got money.

56:27.873 --> 56:29.699
- I've got a lot of money.
- Dude, fuck off.

56:29.701 --> 56:31.964
I need somebody to come back.
I got money.

56:33.139 --> 56:34.271
I got money.

56:40.146 --> 56:41.365
I've got money.

56:44.716 --> 56:46.672
I got a lot of money.
I can give you money.

56:46.674 --> 56:49.806
- I got money and go to my house and I need girlfriend.
- The fuck?

56:49.808 --> 56:51.721
And I got money, a lot of money.

56:51.723 --> 56:53.810
And we go to my house
and I got money.

56:53.812 --> 56:55.333
Lucky you.

56:57.163 --> 57:01.470
Fuck. You fucking slag.

57:01.472 --> 57:06.215
Fuck... Fucking cunt.

57:34.896 --> 57:36.463
You should come in.

57:50.216 --> 57:51.824
Yeah, you come over here.

57:51.826 --> 57:54.087
- Hey.
- Come over.

57:54.089 --> 57:57.743
No wait. You sit here. Sit here.

57:57.745 --> 57:59.573
Yeah, sit there.

58:15.502 --> 58:19.156
Yeah, you come over here, come over here.
I want you to talk to Mama.

58:21.900 --> 58:23.987
This is her,
the one I love now, it's over.

58:23.989 --> 58:26.424
- This is her, this is her.
- So you're the one, huh?

58:26.426 --> 58:28.600
Did you think
you could replace me?

58:28.602 --> 58:30.994
Replace you?

58:30.996 --> 58:33.388
What do you want, old woman?

58:33.390 --> 58:38.264
- This old woman is going to fuck you up, you stupid cunt.
- Who is she?

58:39.613 --> 58:45.008
Is she watching or what?
Is she your mom?

58:47.316 --> 58:50.274
Tell her you're my girlfriend,
tell her you're my girlfriend.

58:51.669 --> 58:53.451
This is the one I love
and now it's over.

58:53.453 --> 58:55.148
This is her, this is her!

58:55.150 --> 58:58.935
- Oliver, did you take your pills?
- This is her.

58:58.937 --> 59:01.459
This is her, this is her,
this is her.

59:01.461 --> 59:02.982
This is her!

59:02.984 --> 59:07.073
This is her! The one I love,
now it's over.

59:07.075 --> 59:08.423
Uh-oh.

59:16.128 --> 59:20.609
Stop looking at me!
Stop looking at me!

59:20.611 --> 59:22.437
Stop looking at me!

59:22.439 --> 59:24.003
Oliver, stop it, stop it.

59:24.005 --> 59:28.619
Leave me alone!
Stop looking at me!

59:30.708 --> 59:34.666
Leave me alone! You're dead!

59:34.668 --> 59:37.147
I killed you,
I killed you, I killed you.

59:37.149 --> 59:39.715
You didn't
take your pills, remember?

59:39.717 --> 59:43.370
Stop, you made such a mess.

59:43.372 --> 59:45.982
Everything is
going to be alright.

59:52.033 --> 59:58.081
Go away! Leave me alone,
leave me alone!

59:58.083 --> 59:59.996
Leave me alone!

59:59.998 --> 01:00:04.348
Oliver, stop, don't do it.
Don't do it.

01:00:10.051 --> 01:00:13.096
You didn't
take your pills, remember?

01:00:13.098 --> 01:00:16.797
Tell them to stop it, Mama.
Leave me alone.

01:00:42.257 --> 01:00:46.303

01:02:40.724 --> 01:02:42.813
Shh!

01:02:44.728 --> 01:02:48.035
Quite now. Shh!

01:03:07.664 --> 01:03:12.362
That's a good boy.
All better now.

01:03:12.364 --> 01:03:17.323
And let's make this the last
time we do anything so silly.

01:03:18.892 --> 01:03:23.373
Take a breath, have a rest

01:03:23.375 --> 01:03:27.377
and then go
and clean up your mess.

01:03:27.379 --> 01:03:31.992
You know, you have to go
and melt your ex-girlfriend.

01:03:34.255 --> 01:03:35.996
Sorry.

01:04:24.175 --> 01:04:26.264
Look, what they did to you.

01:04:28.092 --> 01:04:30.137
They hurt you really bad.

01:04:33.706 --> 01:04:35.752
Help me.

01:04:37.231 --> 01:04:39.581
They thought you were Sophia.

01:04:40.539 --> 01:04:42.062
But you're not.

01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:48.547
Help.

01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:58.076
- You want me to help you?
- Help me.

01:04:58.078 --> 01:05:00.211
You want me to help you?

01:05:07.566 --> 01:05:09.000
Help.

01:05:09.002 --> 01:05:10.917
OK, I am.

01:06:59.939 --> 01:07:01.723
I'm a monster.

01:07:47.291 --> 01:07:49.291
We need to talk.

01:07:49.293 --> 01:07:53.382
You see, there is
a dark side of my life.

01:07:53.384 --> 01:07:55.950
And I am growing to
care for you so much

01:07:55.952 --> 01:07:58.389
that I would never
want it to hurt you.

01:08:00.913 --> 01:08:05.046
Because of this, I feel it would
be better if we didn't...

01:08:05.048 --> 01:08:08.353
I had another dream last night.

01:08:08.355 --> 01:08:11.574
But it wasn't a good dream,
it was a bad dream.

01:08:11.576 --> 01:08:13.491
I dreamt that
you had another woman.

01:08:14.796 --> 01:08:17.625
But that's not why.
There isn't another woman.

01:08:19.584 --> 01:08:23.849
I know.
I saw you dump her body.

01:08:35.817 --> 01:08:37.470
What do you mean?

01:08:38.863 --> 01:08:42.563
I followed you, I watched it.

01:08:49.787 --> 01:08:53.618
When I... when I said
there wasn't another woman...

01:08:55.402 --> 01:08:57.272
I was wrong.

01:08:57.274 --> 01:09:03.321
There is another woman
and it's my mother.

01:09:03.323 --> 01:09:09.023
She... she makes me do terrible
things I don't want to do.

01:09:09.024 --> 01:09:14.769
I know, I know about family
controlling you, hurting you.

01:09:26.738 --> 01:09:31.176
Why... why did you come back?

01:09:32.874 --> 01:09:35.745
Because I couldn't
live without you.

01:09:35.747 --> 01:09:38.270
Because without you
I'm already dead.

01:09:39.881 --> 01:09:41.926
You're my happy place.

01:09:43.450 --> 01:09:45.800
We could be happy together.

01:09:47.411 --> 01:09:50.673
Finally have our own lives
with no one controlling it.

01:09:50.675 --> 01:09:52.416
Just you and me.

01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:31.846
How many?

01:10:34.022 --> 01:10:35.459
How many what?

01:10:37.025 --> 01:10:38.199
People.

01:10:45.686 --> 01:10:47.123
Too many.

01:10:50.213 --> 01:10:52.084
Very high up here.

01:10:53.216 --> 01:10:56.695
It's a lot higher
than I expected.

01:10:56.697 --> 01:10:58.003
Scary.

01:11:06.881 --> 01:11:12.800
What does it feel like...
to kill someone?

01:11:15.934 --> 01:11:18.328
I never got used to it.

01:11:21.983 --> 01:11:24.375
When I saw you
with another girl,

01:11:24.377 --> 01:11:27.902
I... I wanted to...

01:11:31.645 --> 01:11:37.127
then when I saw
that she was dead,

01:11:37.129 --> 01:11:39.738
in a strange way,
it made me happy.

01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:41.742
Is that weird?

01:11:45.224 --> 01:11:46.791
Not to me.

01:12:02.285 --> 01:12:04.374
Nobody's ever liked me.

01:12:07.942 --> 01:12:09.683
I like you.

01:12:51.682 --> 01:12:53.510
You're the monster.

01:16:52.009 --> 01:16:55.314
Look what the cat dragged in.

01:16:55.316 --> 01:16:57.491
Still alive I see.

01:16:57.493 --> 01:16:59.580
Mr. Important, eh.

01:16:59.582 --> 01:17:03.627
Not a care in the world
for his mama.

01:17:03.629 --> 01:17:05.194
Where have you been?

01:17:05.196 --> 01:17:07.152
She... she left me, Mama.

01:17:07.154 --> 01:17:08.589
What?

01:17:08.591 --> 01:17:11.113
I thought we killed that bitch.

01:17:11.115 --> 01:17:14.508
You stupid fucking idiot.

01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:19.121
What have you done?
Of course she left you.

01:17:19.123 --> 01:17:20.731
Why would she leave me?

01:17:20.733 --> 01:17:23.386
What has Mama always
told you about woman?

01:17:23.388 --> 01:17:29.479
You can't trust them. Those
bitches will always hurt you.

01:17:29.481 --> 01:17:32.613
You know you can't
trust anyone but Mama.

01:17:32.615 --> 01:17:35.267
Mama will never leave you.

01:17:35.269 --> 01:17:38.534
Who has always
been there for you?

01:17:39.709 --> 01:17:42.318
You, Mama.
You've always been there.

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:44.755
Remember when
your daddy hurt you?

01:17:44.757 --> 01:17:47.192
- Yeah, I remember.
- When he burned you.

01:17:47.194 --> 01:17:51.153
- I remember.
- What did Mama do to Daddy when he hurt you?

01:17:51.155 --> 01:17:54.417
Tell me, what did Mama do?

01:17:54.419 --> 01:17:57.507
Mama... Mama killed Daddy.
Mama killed Daddy.

01:17:57.509 --> 01:18:02.558
Yes, she did,
because Mama loves Oliver.

01:18:05.125 --> 01:18:07.735
Is Oliver
going to be a good boy?

01:18:07.737 --> 01:18:09.565
Yeah, I am going to be good now.

01:18:10.914 --> 01:18:13.873
Because it's time.

01:18:16.136 --> 01:18:18.486
God, I'm horny.

01:18:22.882 --> 01:18:24.580
OK, Mama.

01:20:19.477 --> 01:20:21.433
Oliver.

01:20:21.435 --> 01:20:23.873
Oliver, what's going on?

01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:29.441
Shhh! Mama's watching.

01:20:29.443 --> 01:20:31.010
Who's there?

01:20:34.057 --> 01:20:35.186
Oliver.

01:20:35.188 --> 01:20:36.884
Where did you go?

01:20:36.886 --> 01:20:39.147
You left me
alone with her again.

01:20:39.149 --> 01:20:42.324
Sorry, I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

01:20:42.326 --> 01:20:45.675
They took me away again,
they took me away. I'm so sorry.

01:20:45.677 --> 01:20:50.027
- I told you about my family.
- That bitch. Kill her, Oliver.

01:20:50.029 --> 01:20:51.899
- Kill her, kill her, kill her.
- They won't let me go.

01:20:51.901 --> 01:20:53.378
- That fucking bitch.
- They won't let me be alone.

01:20:53.380 --> 01:20:55.467
That's her.
Kill her, kill her.

01:20:55.469 --> 01:20:57.165
Oliver, please, listen to me,
I love you.

01:20:57.167 --> 01:20:59.384
- Kill her, kill her!
- And I know you love me, too.

01:20:59.386 --> 01:21:03.695
Kill the bitch.
Do it now. Do it.

01:21:05.001 --> 01:21:09.090
It's OK, Oliver. You can do it.

01:21:09.092 --> 01:21:11.570
Kill me.

01:21:11.572 --> 01:21:13.966
Do it, do it, do it.

01:21:15.141 --> 01:21:17.753
I'd rather die
than live without you.

01:21:18.884 --> 01:21:21.800
Oliver slit her fucking throat.

01:21:22.888 --> 01:21:26.803
She wants to die. Kill her.

01:21:26.805 --> 01:21:28.154
No.

01:21:29.286 --> 01:21:31.070
Kill her Oliver.

01:21:32.332 --> 01:21:34.291
Kill her, kill her, kill her.

01:21:39.122 --> 01:21:42.210
She's a slut.

01:21:42.212 --> 01:21:45.781
What do you think you doing,
you stupid child?

01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:51.175
She's going to hurt you.

01:21:51.177 --> 01:21:54.528
You're going to regret this.
You stu...

01:24:47.005 --> 01:24:49.745
Mama says I'm a good boy now.

01:24:49.747 --> 01:24:51.529
I'm a good boy.

01:24:54.534 --> 01:24:56.230
Mama wants me to do this...

01:25:16.817 --> 01:25:19.775
'Cause I'm a good boy, Mama.

01:25:19.777 --> 01:25:21.168
I'm a good boy.

01:25:21.170 --> 01:25:23.650
I'm a good...

01:25:25.304 --> 01:25:26.608
Oliver?

01:25:30.222 --> 01:25:31.484
Oliver?

01:25:44.367 --> 01:25:45.977
Oliver?

01:25:46.978 --> 01:25:50.110
All roads lead to Mama.
