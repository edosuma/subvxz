00:00.340 --> 00:02.410
Previously on The Americans...

00:02.510 --> 00:04.939
The Centre started a program
to develop officers

00:05.050 --> 00:07.280
they're calling Second
Generation Illegals.

00:07.380 --> 00:09.010
They want Paige to be next.

00:09.120 --> 00:12.180
I trained as hard as I could every day.

00:12.290 --> 00:14.020
I'm not afraid anymore.

00:14.120 --> 00:15.919
And you're not going to be, either.

00:15.920 --> 00:17.720
So, I met someone.

00:17.780 --> 00:20.020
Hey, this is Philip. Philip, Renee.

00:20.060 --> 00:20.790
Nice to meet you.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.430
She's moving in.

00:22.530 --> 00:23.900
What is it?

00:24.000 --> 00:25.860
Oh, j-just stuff from work.

00:25.970 --> 00:27.900
Oleg Burov is back in Moscow.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.300
We can go with the tape you made of him

00:29.380 --> 00:31.870
admitting their defector
was actually KGB.

00:31.920 --> 00:33.490
You're going to get him killed.

00:33.590 --> 00:36.400
I swore an oath to uphold the
Constitution, Agent Beeman.

00:36.420 --> 00:39.590
Unlike you, I haven't
forgotten what that means.

00:39.620 --> 00:41.040

00:41.140 --> 00:42.770
_

00:43.150 --> 00:44.749
_

00:44.750 --> 00:47.950
When you're walking in the dark,
you don't know the answer,

00:48.050 --> 00:49.350
but you have an instinct...

00:49.460 --> 00:52.060
for how to move forward.

00:52.160 --> 00:53.460
I can't just get this order from them

00:53.560 --> 00:55.560
and do whatever they say.

00:55.660 --> 00:59.200
It's not just me having a hard time.

00:59.300 --> 01:01.060
It's you, too.

01:01.170 --> 01:03.930
We're allowed to have a life.

01:04.040 --> 01:05.540
I can't.

01:05.640 --> 01:07.170
I'm sorry.

01:08.440 --> 01:12.610
Maybe you should stop...
run the travel agency.

01:12.710 --> 01:14.580
You need me, Elizabeth.

01:14.680 --> 01:17.550
I don't want to see you
like this anymore.

I'm, uh, just about to leave.

06:43.240 --> 06:45.480
You sure you don't want to go with me?

06:45.580 --> 06:47.700
I've got work.

06:47.750 --> 06:49.110
Okay.

06:53.620 --> 06:55.850
I wish I could just run off

06:55.960 --> 06:59.300
and go watch Henry play
hockey right now, Philip.

06:59.390 --> 07:00.830
I know.

07:05.870 --> 07:08.200
Have a good trip.

07:56.520 --> 07:59.050
Go, Henry, go!

07:59.150 --> 08:01.580
Let's go! Come on!

08:06.160 --> 08:07.020
Way to go, Henry!

08:07.130 --> 08:09.790
Now stay with him! Stay with him!

08:09.900 --> 08:12.800
Come on! Back, back! Back!

08:14.400 --> 08:15.630
Go, Henry!

08:18.000 --> 08:20.800
Go! Shoot it! Shoot it!

08:28.740 --> 08:29.300
Whoo!

08:29.400 --> 08:31.150
- Get him, Henry!
- Get him, Henry!

08:31.250 --> 08:32.409
Yeah! Whoo!

08:32.520 --> 08:34.679
Looks like Henry's got a
little fan club going.

08:38.419 --> 08:40.419
Theo's kicking butt today.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.919
I taught him everything he knows.

08:44.130 --> 08:45.890
Way to go, Jordy!

08:46.000 --> 08:48.630
Come on!

08:54.540 --> 08:56.670
They were all so man-hungry.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.240
Lyudmila, anyway.

08:58.340 --> 09:02.610
And the families, with
money-- it was all so...

09:02.710 --> 09:03.850
Normal?

09:03.950 --> 09:05.680
And the way they lived in the beginning,

09:05.780 --> 09:07.880
it was like my freshman-year dorm.

09:07.980 --> 09:11.320
I lived in a workers'
dormitory when I was young.

09:11.420 --> 09:14.560
It was hard work, but
we had a lot of fun.

09:14.660 --> 09:15.890
Really?

09:15.990 --> 09:18.060
We would sneak boys in at night.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.730
That's why I live off-campus.

09:19.830 --> 09:22.200
I thought Katerina was great.

09:22.300 --> 09:25.570
Yeah, she was so determined. And brave.

09:25.670 --> 09:27.370
She reminded me of you, Mom.

09:27.470 --> 09:28.900
Thank you.

09:29.010 --> 09:30.440
In that skirt suit, with the vest,

09:30.540 --> 09:31.660
running that whole factory.

09:31.700 --> 09:33.340
- Fantastic.
- Yeah.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.140
That's how it is there.

09:35.250 --> 09:38.050
But then she let that guy--

09:38.150 --> 09:39.450
put her in her place.

09:39.460 --> 09:40.750
Like... dominate her.

09:40.850 --> 09:42.520
I hated that.

09:42.620 --> 09:46.090
Sometimes it's a little
more traditional there.

09:46.190 --> 09:51.690
But some women I know would
have cracked his head open.

09:54.030 --> 09:56.760
Did your professor talk about
the Summit again this week?

09:56.870 --> 10:00.270
He spent the whole class talking
about the Soviet SS-20.

10:00.370 --> 10:02.100
What did he say?

10:02.200 --> 10:04.410
It's got a range of 3,100 miles,

10:04.510 --> 10:05.740
can carry up to three

10:05.840 --> 10:07.500
independently targetable warheads,

10:07.520 --> 10:10.940
each with an explosive
power of 150 kilotons.

10:11.050 --> 10:13.550
And it can be launched
from the back of a truck.

10:13.650 --> 10:16.380
After an hour of that, in the
last two minutes of class,

10:16.490 --> 10:19.250
he said if the Summit's a success,

10:19.350 --> 10:22.250
there won't be any SS-20s anymore.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.160
So you learned all that for nothing.

10:24.260 --> 10:27.330
He thinks the Summit's
going to be a big success.

10:27.430 --> 10:29.060
It's hard to trust the Americans.

10:29.160 --> 10:32.130
There's a long history of
these types of negotiations.

10:32.230 --> 10:33.800
I know.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.940
Okay. You want a ride
back to your apartment?

10:36.020 --> 10:37.640
- Yeah.
- Wait in the car.

10:37.740 --> 10:38.770
Okay.

10:38.870 --> 10:39.740
See ya.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.010
Mm.

10:43.240 --> 10:44.140
Keep your eyes open.

10:44.250 --> 10:45.810
Mm-hmm.

10:50.920 --> 10:53.120
I saw McCleesh, coming out of DoE.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.690
He was with some negotiators

10:54.790 --> 10:57.720
for the ground-launched
missile verification regime.

10:57.830 --> 10:59.760
I'm going to see him soon.

11:01.500 --> 11:02.790
I was at Haskard's Tuesday night.

11:02.900 --> 11:05.060
I couldn't get to the
briefcase. Back there tonight.

11:05.170 --> 11:08.930
And then Voller again Thursday.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.670
Are you sleeping?

11:12.610 --> 11:13.940
Sure.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.310
You got nine weeks to the Summit.

11:18.950 --> 11:20.080
I got a signal.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.950
You have a meeting in
Mexico. Tomorrow morning.

11:22.050 --> 11:25.820
I don't know who it's
with or what it's about.

11:25.920 --> 11:28.120
They didn't tell you anything?

11:28.820 --> 11:30.390
It happens.

11:36.930 --> 11:39.500
I can't believe what Moscow looks like.

11:40.330 --> 11:43.270
You could've been one of
those silly little girls.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.200
Clients want to know your experiences.

18:57.300 --> 19:00.840
They-- They want to hear about
Lacey's honeymoon in Barbados

19:00.940 --> 19:02.340
and what made it so special.

19:02.440 --> 19:05.110
The condo was perfect
because you knew to switch.

19:05.210 --> 19:07.610
And you took that
incredible fishing boat,

19:07.710 --> 19:08.880
where they cooked your catch.

19:08.980 --> 19:10.160
That was amazing.

19:10.180 --> 19:11.140
Well, it's a great story.

19:11.220 --> 19:13.050
And, Rick, your-- your
road trip in the Delta--

19:13.150 --> 19:14.760
- Don't remind me.
- No, no, no.

19:14.860 --> 19:16.790
There you go, because that's
what they need to hear.

19:16.890 --> 19:19.900
We're not brochures. We're people.

19:19.940 --> 19:22.490
All it takes is one conversation
to produce a breakthrough.

19:22.590 --> 19:25.230

Great. She is all yours.

23:32.600 --> 23:34.570
See? He can't handle her either.

23:37.180 --> 23:38.940
See? He hates Bork, too.

23:41.050 --> 23:42.280
How about your high school student?

23:42.380 --> 23:44.280
He's great. Doing really well.

23:44.380 --> 23:45.820
- He's a hockey star.
- Yeah.

23:45.920 --> 23:47.320
He's like Wayne Gretzky.

23:47.420 --> 23:48.950
- Ooh!
- Really?

23:49.050 --> 23:51.320
Kind of. He's become a real

23:51.420 --> 23:53.060
That's cool.

23:53.160 --> 23:55.930
Oh, he's not so little anymore.
He's taller than Philip.

23:56.030 --> 23:57.260
Not quite.

24:00.621 --> 24:02.300
Okay, how about dessert?

24:02.400 --> 24:04.430
I made too much. You're

24:04.540 --> 24:06.100
Oh, no, no, no, sit, sit.

24:06.200 --> 24:07.100
He's hungry.

24:07.210 --> 24:09.140
No, he's just tired, give him to me.

24:09.240 --> 24:10.140
Okay, okay.

24:16.980 --> 24:17.980
Just leave 'em.

24:18.080 --> 24:20.380
I'm going to get you started.

24:21.690 --> 24:24.190
How can you be so cute
when you're cranky?

24:24.290 --> 24:25.320
Maybe he is hungry.

24:25.420 --> 24:27.020
- You want to nurse?
- Yeah.

24:27.120 --> 24:28.320
Let's bring him in here.

24:29.590 --> 24:31.860
So noisy, Calvin, why you so noisy?

24:31.960 --> 24:34.060
Dennis was saying on the way over

24:34.160 --> 24:35.530
it's so nice to come here

24:35.630 --> 24:37.700
because they never see
each other at work.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.770
Well, they still have
that one case together.

24:39.870 --> 24:41.400
- The couple?
- Yeah.

24:41.510 --> 24:43.770
I don't know much about it.

24:43.870 --> 24:47.010
I think their marriage is in trouble.

24:47.110 --> 24:48.910
I don't like that he's
alone with her sometimes.

24:49.010 --> 24:50.280
Oh?

24:50.380 --> 24:52.780
He hasn't said anything?

24:52.880 --> 24:55.520
I mean, I don't know anything.

24:55.620 --> 24:56.790
Is it really bothering you?

24:56.890 --> 24:59.550
I don't know. It's just...

24:59.660 --> 25:03.150
he tells me stuff now,
but I still feel like

25:03.180 --> 25:04.720

- Yeah.

25:04.860 --> 25:06.630
You ever get that?

25:06.730 --> 25:08.900
Only all the time.

Excuse me, I'm with security. US Navy.

38:17.250 --> 38:18.780
I noticed you sitting in your car here.

38:18.890 --> 38:20.150
It's not the best neighborhood.

38:20.250 --> 38:22.590
I'm just waiting for a friend.

38:22.690 --> 38:25.120
Mm-hmm. Can I see your
driver's license, please?

38:31.230 --> 38:33.260
Thank you.

38:36.970 --> 38:38.070
Ellen Terreno.

38:38.170 --> 38:40.170
Picture doesn't do you justice.

38:40.270 --> 38:41.540
I don't know if you know, there's a lot

38:41.640 --> 38:43.710
of sensitive, restricted
areas around here.

38:43.810 --> 38:44.980
- Really?
- Yeah.

38:45.080 --> 38:46.440
Where?

38:46.550 --> 38:49.050
Well, about eight blocks that
way is the Naval Observatory.

38:49.150 --> 38:50.250
That's where I work.

38:50.350 --> 38:52.080
It's also the Vice
President's residence.

38:52.280 --> 38:54.220
A lot of embassies to the northwest.

38:54.320 --> 38:55.990
I'm actually going to
need your phone number

38:56.090 --> 38:58.690
and a second form of ID.

38:58.790 --> 39:00.360
I've got my college ID.

39:00.460 --> 39:02.190
That'll do.

39:24.280 --> 39:26.720
One honk, get closer.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.670
Thanks! I'll see you later!

40:06.790 --> 40:08.190
I haven't stayed there.

40:08.290 --> 40:10.830
It's good. Old.

40:10.930 --> 40:13.300
- Run-dow?
- No, more classic.

40:13.400 --> 40:15.160
But Madison Hotel is also good.

40:15.270 --> 40:17.240
It feels like South America.

40:17.480 --> 40:19.870
- South America?
- Ah, no. I'm sorry.

40:19.970 --> 40:21.500
I mean American South.

40:21.600 --> 40:24.040
I'm telling you, the best
Chinese food in the city, okay?

40:24.140 --> 40:25.040
It's about a block away.

40:25.140 --> 40:26.340
Come with me,

40:26.440 --> 40:28.710
I got, like, 40 minutes
left on my dinner break.

40:28.810 --> 40:31.550
I wish I could, but my friend
and I already have plans.

40:31.650 --> 40:32.850
Next time.

40:32.950 --> 40:36.850
Okay. Well, here's your
driver's license, okay?

40:36.950 --> 40:38.590
I'm gonna hold on to
this other one, though.

40:38.690 --> 40:39.890
You can get it back Saturday night

40:39.990 --> 40:41.620
after I take you to dinner.

40:42.590 --> 40:43.590
Call you tomorrow.

40:43.690 --> 40:45.890
Oh, come on. You can't
take my college ID.

40:46.000 --> 40:46.780
I need it.

40:46.820 --> 40:48.900
I-I promise I'll meet you Saturday.

40:49.830 --> 40:51.570
I don't know, beautiful
girl like yourself

40:51.670 --> 40:52.630
might forget, you know.

40:52.740 --> 40:54.870
I couldn't forget you.

40:56.240 --> 40:57.210
That was a nice try.

40:57.310 --> 40:59.010
I'll see you Saturday, Ellen.

41:10.420 --> 41:12.190
You must miss your girls, being her.

41:12.290 --> 41:13.590
Uh, before I leave,

41:13.690 --> 41:16.360
they are sweetest they have ever been.

41:16.460 --> 41:18.460
Aha. And school?

41:18.560 --> 41:20.880
Both smarter than me. I can admit this.

41:20.960 --> 41:23.060
My Katya, she is serious.

41:28.600 --> 41:31.170
He was going for Chinese food
at a place called Hunan Taste.

41:31.270 --> 41:32.840
That's the only reason he was out there.

41:32.940 --> 41:34.910
N. Hadley. Blue eyes. 5'11".

41:35.010 --> 41:37.080
US Naval Observatory patch on his hat.

41:37.180 --> 41:38.280
Black uniform.

41:38.380 --> 41:39.780
I saw everything, Mom.

41:39.880 --> 41:41.580
I was a mile out of the zone,
like I'm supposed to be.

41:41.680 --> 41:43.050
Waiting for my next shift.

41:43.150 --> 41:45.020
Maybe I shouldn't have been reading.

41:45.120 --> 41:47.120
It's okay. It's not your fault.

41:47.220 --> 41:48.450
I'm sorry, Mom. Damn it!

41:48.560 --> 41:51.460
This is-- This is part of it.
This is what happens.

41:51.560 --> 41:52.760
You handled it well.

41:52.860 --> 41:54.790
He has my ID. With my picture.

41:54.900 --> 41:57.260
Fake name, fake address.

41:57.370 --> 41:58.500
You gave him a fake phone number.

41:58.600 --> 42:00.770
You remembered everything. Okay?

42:00.870 --> 42:03.170
He's a security guard at
the US Naval Observatory.

42:03.270 --> 42:06.040
He's not a police officer.
This isn't a big deal.

42:08.710 --> 42:10.680
I really want you to understand this.

42:10.780 --> 42:13.700
Under pressure, you kept your cover.

42:13.780 --> 42:16.210
You said and did all the right things.

42:16.320 --> 42:18.120
There's nothing to worry about.

42:20.920 --> 42:22.420
Thanks.

42:45.350 --> 42:47.710
I need you to drop me near
Wisconsin and Calvert.

42:47.810 --> 42:49.580
- Is she okay?
- Yeah.

42:50.880 --> 42:52.980
I like Julie, but I told
you when she came on,

42:53.090 --> 42:53.950
she's too young.

42:54.050 --> 42:56.190
I have a lot of faith in this one.

42:56.290 --> 42:57.490
Drive.

43:13.610 --> 43:15.340
Wait, stop here.

43:38.200 --> 43:40.360
Excuse me. Sir?

43:40.460 --> 43:41.700
Can I help you?

43:43.440 --> 43:45.200
Miss?

43:45.300 --> 43:48.040
Yeah, uh, do you have a light?

43:48.140 --> 43:50.640
Yeah. Somewhere.

44:55.380 --> 44:58.080
I always like DC this time of year.

45:00.050 --> 45:04.090
I prefer it when the
cherry blossoms are out.

45:09.360 --> 45:10.960
You sure you're good?

45:11.060 --> 45:13.330
I spent nine hours getting clean.

45:13.430 --> 45:15.370
They'd have to have the whole FBI on me

45:15.470 --> 45:17.870
for me to miss it.

45:17.970 --> 45:19.300
Okay.

45:21.240 --> 45:23.280
Arkady Ivanovich sent me.

45:23.380 --> 45:26.110
We need your help.

45:26.210 --> 45:27.350
We?

45:30.220 --> 45:33.890
The people... running the
organization right now,

45:33.990 --> 45:36.260
they have very...

45:36.360 --> 45:38.560
old-line view of things.

45:39.490 --> 45:42.990
Not interested in all the
changes that are happening.

45:43.100 --> 45:46.360
And Gorbachev doesn't have the
power to get rid of them.

45:48.030 --> 45:50.200
I'm out of it.

45:50.300 --> 45:51.500
He told me.

45:53.640 --> 45:56.270
I wouldn't be here except...

45:58.180 --> 46:00.720
some very powerful people

46:00.740 --> 46:02.550
are out there to get rid of Gorbachev.

46:02.650 --> 46:05.740
To stop all the good things

46:05.760 --> 46:08.250
that have been happening
lately in our country.

46:09.160 --> 46:13.020
Your wife had a meeting in Latin America

46:13.130 --> 46:16.390
with a general from the
Strategic Rocket Forces.

46:17.460 --> 46:19.130
Strange, right?

46:20.870 --> 46:23.830
No stranger than us meeting here.

46:25.640 --> 46:29.540
My wife just does her job.

46:29.640 --> 46:31.240
That's all she's ever done.

46:31.340 --> 46:33.210
She's good at it.

46:33.310 --> 46:34.240
I know.

46:34.350 --> 46:37.410
But it's possible that she is being used

46:37.520 --> 46:40.050
by the people who are...

46:40.150 --> 46:44.090
trying to stop all the progress
that we've been making.

46:48.760 --> 46:51.530
Or she is one of them.

46:58.070 --> 47:01.000
Everything is divided up.

47:02.570 --> 47:05.710
That's how Arkady Ivanovich
explained it to me.

47:07.580 --> 47:11.050
This summit, it could
be a turning point.

47:12.080 --> 47:15.580
We have a pretty good
idea where you stand.

47:15.690 --> 47:17.450
I'm not involved anymore.

47:17.560 --> 47:20.120
And this has nothing to do with me.

47:24.360 --> 47:26.930
We want you to find out
what your wife is doing

47:27.030 --> 47:28.560
and tell us.

47:30.070 --> 47:33.400
And if you have to--

47:33.500 --> 47:34.770
stop her.

47:40.140 --> 47:41.980
She's my wife.

47:46.120 --> 47:47.550
I understand.

47:54.860 --> 48:01.600
I left my wife and my
baby boy to be here.

48:01.700 --> 48:04.070
I don't have any immunity.

48:05.740 --> 48:08.470
If I'm arrested, I'm finished.

48:10.440 --> 48:15.080
If they catch me and send me back,

48:15.180 --> 48:17.340
I'll be shot.

48:19.720 --> 48:24.620
I'm here because the
future of our country

48:24.720 --> 48:26.890
is being decided right now.

48:27.820 --> 48:29.960
You know that.

48:32.130 --> 48:35.800
I'm sorry you have to make
some tough decisions, too.

48:38.500 --> 48:41.070
I'll wait to hear from you.

49:41.030 --> 49:44.030
There's all this crap in the
paper about the Summit--

49:44.130 --> 49:46.430
like we're the ones
standing in the way...

49:46.530 --> 49:48.830
You working on it?

49:51.870 --> 49:53.840
It would be good if they made a deal.

49:53.940 --> 49:55.810
Fewer weapons.

49:58.680 --> 50:00.880
Fewer weapons for us, not for them.

50:02.180 --> 50:05.140
They just want to use
these treaties as a cover

50:05.160 --> 50:06.520
so they can keep building
up their arsenal

50:06.620 --> 50:08.250
while we get rid of ours.

50:08.350 --> 50:10.190
That sound fair to you?

50:11.160 --> 50:12.820
What's going on with you?

50:15.700 --> 50:17.160
What do you mean?

50:17.260 --> 50:19.900
Elizabeth, look at you.

50:23.640 --> 50:25.540
You smell like cigarettes all the time.

50:25.640 --> 50:27.300
Your whole way of being seems off.

50:27.410 --> 50:29.920
These past few months,

50:29.980 --> 50:31.740
it feels like it's just
getting worse and worse.

50:31.840 --> 50:35.510
Well, I'm busy, obviously.

50:36.510 --> 50:39.180
It is finally getting to you.

50:39.280 --> 50:40.780
After all these years.

50:42.050 --> 50:44.120
You're amazing--

50:44.220 --> 50:46.860
but it is finally getting to you.

50:48.490 --> 50:50.700
When you told me to
quit, you were right.

50:50.720 --> 50:51.880
It was the best thing I ever did.

50:51.900 --> 50:54.130
And I was thinking...

50:54.230 --> 50:55.400
I'm-- Look.

50:55.500 --> 50:57.570
I'm so tired right now.

50:57.770 --> 50:58.970
Work was...

50:59.070 --> 51:01.440
I-I know. I'm sorry.
Look, I-I just need to--

51:01.540 --> 51:02.940
I have to talk to you about something.

51:03.040 --> 51:06.610
Let's talk tomorrow. I'm--
Honestly, I'm just beat.

51:06.710 --> 51:09.210
I-I know how hard you're working.

51:09.310 --> 51:10.650
I'm not complaining.

51:10.750 --> 51:12.710
This summit is a big deal.

51:12.820 --> 51:14.220
There's a lot to do.

51:14.320 --> 51:16.280
Whatever it is you want to talk about,

51:16.300 --> 51:17.440
we can talk about tomorrow.

51:17.520 --> 51:20.260
Whether it's Henry or
your work, it can wait.

51:20.360 --> 51:22.760
It's not Henry. Today, I--

51:22.860 --> 51:23.730
Whatever it is,

51:23.830 --> 51:24.760
I have to figure out

51:24.840 --> 51:26.360
what the hell is going
on with the Summit

51:26.460 --> 51:27.980
and everything else right now.

51:28.160 --> 51:31.420
So, I know you love to talk,
but you don't have to sit here

51:31.440 --> 51:32.830
and wait for me 'til
1:00 in the morning.

51:32.940 --> 51:35.380
I know how tired you are,
but I need to talk to you.

51:35.500 --> 51:38.710
If you knew how tired I am, you
wouldn't still be talking.

51:38.810 --> 51:40.010
Elizabeth, this-- this job you're doing,

51:40.110 --> 51:42.540
it's-- it's exhausting and
it's complicated and hard.

51:42.650 --> 51:44.550
I don't need another one
of your speeches, Philip.

51:44.650 --> 51:46.180
I need sleep.

51:46.280 --> 51:47.950
Let me sleep.

51:49.590 --> 51:51.650
Great.

51:51.760 --> 51:53.890
Fine, go sleep.
