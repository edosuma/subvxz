[Christmas music plays on stereo]

26:17.701 --> 26:21.079
Well, this Christmas party's
turning out to be ho-ho-horrible.

26:21.162 --> 26:24.916
Yeah, Sam. I thought you said
your parents were out for the night.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.586
-So why aren't we throwing a rager?
-Yeah.

26:27.669 --> 26:30.672
There's a keg on the way.
It'll just be a few minutes.

26:30.755 --> 26:33.008
Can we at least
put on a Christmas special?

26:33.091 --> 26:37.345
I'd even watch that creepy one
with the little elf dentist.

26:38.471 --> 26:40.015
Yeah, I'm that bored.

26:40.724 --> 26:42.434
-[doorbell rings]
-It's here.

26:43.018 --> 26:44.102
[Chris chuckles]

26:47.606 --> 26:49.691
[Chris] What? Oh, dude.

26:49.774 --> 26:50.817
-What the…
-No way!

26:50.900 --> 26:53.612
Oh, hell no! You gotta be kidding me.

26:53.695 --> 26:56.781
What the hell are you doing here?
This isn't a keg party.

26:57.282 --> 27:03.079
-I bought this hat for nothing?
-Wait. You Parent Trapped us? Why?

27:03.663 --> 27:06.082
Look, I know
we haven't always gotten along,

27:06.166 --> 27:08.209
but Cobra Kai is the bigger threat now.

27:09.294 --> 27:10.879
To all of us.

27:11.546 --> 27:14.299
We think we'd stand a better chance
if we joined forces.

27:14.382 --> 27:15.925
Two dojos are stronger than one.

27:16.009 --> 27:18.219
-This is ridiculous.
-I know, right?

27:18.303 --> 27:21.348
-We've all done shitty things.
-Like breaking Demetri's arm.

27:21.431 --> 27:23.808
-You started that.
-You almost got me fired!

27:23.892 --> 27:26.186
God, I hate your stupid face so much.

27:26.269 --> 27:28.229
If you died,
I wouldn't attend your funeral.

27:28.313 --> 27:30.815
-This isn't gonna work.
-It has to.

27:30.899 --> 27:32.776
[dramatic music playing]

27:32.859 --> 27:35.487
[Sam] We have one last chance
to make things right.

27:38.114 --> 27:39.407
[exhales heavily]

27:40.533 --> 27:41.910
[Sam] Alone, we're nothing.

27:41.993 --> 27:44.287
But if we work together, we have a shot.

27:47.832 --> 27:51.252
If we can't get over the past,
the fighting will never end.

27:53.838 --> 27:55.715
[imperceptible]

27:55.799 --> 27:57.717
[Sam] We have to confront our enemies.

27:58.176 --> 28:01.763
-[Tommy] Take a right, check it out.
-[Bobby] Forget it. It's ancient history.

28:01.846 --> 28:03.264
Hey, Johnny!

28:06.434 --> 28:08.311
[Sam] This rivalry has to stop.

28:09.396 --> 28:11.314
One way or another.

28:18.405 --> 28:20.323
