00:43.793 --> 00:45.461
Hi, honey.

00:45.754 --> 00:47.254
Hi, Mom.

00:49.674 --> 00:51.884
You feeling any better?

00:51.968 --> 00:53.719
A little bit.

00:54.763 --> 00:55.888
Guess what?

00:55.972 --> 00:57.139
What?

00:57.223 --> 00:58.766
Your grandfather's here.

00:58.850 --> 01:01.852
Mom, can't you tell him
I'm sick?

01:01.936 --> 01:03.520
You're sick?

01:03.605 --> 01:05.647
That's why he's here.

01:05.732 --> 01:06.857
He'll pinch my cheek.

01:06.941 --> 01:08.525
I hate that.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.319
Maybe he won't.

01:10.862 --> 01:14.865
Hey, how is the sickie? Huh?

01:17.744 --> 01:20.746
I think I'll leave
you two pals alone.

01:20.830 --> 01:22.873
I brought you
a special present.

01:22.957 --> 01:24.041
What is it?

01:24.125 --> 01:25.292
Open it up.

01:30.465 --> 01:31.548
A book?

01:31.633 --> 01:32.591
That's right.

01:32.675 --> 01:35.719
When I was your age,
television was called books.

01:35.970 --> 01:37.971
And this is
a special book.

01:38.181 --> 01:41.266
It was the book
my father used to read to me
when I was sick,

01:41.351 --> 01:43.977
and I used to read it
to your father.

01:44.062 --> 01:46.355
And today,
I'm gonna read it to you.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.607
Has it got
any sports in it?

01:48.691 --> 01:50.275
Are you kidding?

01:50.360 --> 01:54.029
Fencing, fighting,
torture, revenge,

01:54.114 --> 01:57.699
giants, monsters,
chases, escapes,

01:57.784 --> 02:00.536
true love, miracles.

02:00.620 --> 02:04.957
Doesn't sound too bad.
I'll try and stay awake.

02:05.041 --> 02:08.418
Well, thank you very much.
Very nice of you.

02:08.502 --> 02:11.338
Your vote of confidence
is overwhelming.

02:11.881 --> 02:13.215
All right.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.385
"The Princess Bride,

02:17.637 --> 02:19.596
"by S. Morgenstern.

02:19.681 --> 02:21.890
"Chapter one.

02:21.975 --> 02:26.145
"Buttercup was raised
on a small farm
in the country of Florin.

02:26.604 --> 02:29.398
"Her favorite pastimes
were riding her horse

02:29.482 --> 02:32.401
"and tormenting the farm boy
that worked there.

02:32.694 --> 02:36.738
"His name was Westley,
but she never
called him that."

02:36.823 --> 02:39.283
Isn't that
a wonderful beginning?

02:39.742 --> 02:42.077
Yeah, it's really good.

02:42.287 --> 02:46.874
"Nothing gave Buttercup
as much pleasure
as ordering Westley around."

02:47.083 --> 02:50.127
Farm Boy,
polish my horse's saddle.

02:50.545 --> 02:53.088
I want to see my face
shining in it by morning.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.174
As you wish.

02:58.011 --> 03:01.430
"'As you wish'
was all he ever said to her."

03:03.933 --> 03:06.727
Farm Boy,
fill these with water.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.230
Please?

03:10.440 --> 03:11.982
As you wish.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.780
"That day,
she was amazed to discover

03:18.865 --> 03:21.033
"that when he was saying,
'As you wish,'

03:21.117 --> 03:23.160
"what he meant was,
'I love you.'

03:25.580 --> 03:30.542
"And even more amazing
was the day she realized
she truly loved him back."

03:32.378 --> 03:33.712
Farm Boy,

03:39.636 --> 03:41.136
fetch me that pitcher.

03:56.402 --> 03:58.612
As you wish.

04:08.414 --> 04:10.165
Hold it. Hold it.

04:10.416 --> 04:13.252
What is this?
Are you trying to trick me?

04:13.336 --> 04:15.504
Where's the sports?

04:16.380 --> 04:18.130
Is this a kissing book?

04:18.216 --> 04:19.882
Wait. Just wait.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.927
When does it get good?

04:22.011 --> 04:25.138
Keep your shirt on.
Let me read.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.557
"Westley had no money
for marriage,

04:27.642 --> 04:29.851
"so he packed
his few belongings
and left the farm

04:29.936 --> 04:31.853
"to seek his fortune
across the sea.

04:32.230 --> 04:35.399
"It was a very emotional time
for Buttercup."

04:35.483 --> 04:38.193
I don't believe this.

04:38.486 --> 04:41.238
I fear I'll never
see you again.

04:41.572 --> 04:43.115
Of course you will.

04:43.992 --> 04:46.285
But what if something
happens to you?

04:49.872 --> 04:51.123
Hear this now.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.751
I will always come for you.

04:56.045 --> 04:58.213
But how can you be sure?

04:59.215 --> 05:00.632
This is true love.

05:02.677 --> 05:04.594
Do you think this happens
every day?

05:16.649 --> 05:19.109
"Westley didn't reach
his destination.

05:19.193 --> 05:22.404
"His ship was attacked
by the Dread Pirate Roberts,

05:22.488 --> 05:25.157
"who never
left captives alive.

05:25.241 --> 05:27.784
"When Buttercup got the news
that Westley was murdered..."

05:27.869 --> 05:29.619
Murdered by pirates is good.

05:29.704 --> 05:32.122
"...she went into her room
and shut the door.

05:32.540 --> 05:35.250
"And for days,
she neither slept nor ate."

05:35.877 --> 05:38.045
I will never love again.

05:43.801 --> 05:48.388
"Five years later,
the main square of Florin City
was filled as never before

05:48.473 --> 05:52.809
"to hear the announcement
of the great Prince
Humperdinck's bride-to-be."

06:02.195 --> 06:05.906
My people,
a month from now,

06:06.115 --> 06:10.118
our country will have
its 500th anniversary.

06:10.203 --> 06:14.289
On that sundown,
I shall marry a lady

06:14.457 --> 06:17.793
who was once
a commoner like yourselves.

06:18.294 --> 06:19.336
But perhaps

06:19.629 --> 06:22.214
you will not find her common

06:22.423 --> 06:23.715
now.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.467
Would you like to meet her?

06:25.635 --> 06:27.469
Yes!

06:27.887 --> 06:29.679
My people,

06:30.681 --> 06:34.142
the Princess Buttercup!

06:54.664 --> 06:58.166
"Buttercup's emptiness
consumed her.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.377
"Although the law of the land
gave Humperdinck the right

07:00.461 --> 07:02.254
"to choose his bride,

07:02.338 --> 07:04.798
"she did not love him.

07:09.762 --> 07:13.515
"Despite Humperdinck's
reassurance that she would
grow to love him,

07:13.599 --> 07:17.018
"the only joy she found
was in her daily ride."

07:29.365 --> 07:31.032
A word, my lady?

07:32.535 --> 07:35.954
We are but poor,
lost circus performers.

07:36.372 --> 07:38.582
Is there a village nearby?

07:38.958 --> 07:41.751
There is nothing nearby,
not for miles.

07:42.211 --> 07:45.380
Then there will be no one
to hear you scream.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.264
What is that
you're ripping?

07:54.348 --> 07:56.975
It is fabric from the uniform
of an army officer of Guilder.

07:57.643 --> 07:59.144
Who is Guilder?

07:59.228 --> 08:00.770
The country across the sea.

08:00.855 --> 08:02.731
The sworn enemy of Florin.

08:02.815 --> 08:06.318
Go! Once the horse
reaches the castle,

08:06.569 --> 08:07.986
the fabric will make
the prince suspect

08:08.070 --> 08:10.822
the Guilderians
have abducted his love.

08:10.907 --> 08:13.241
When he finds her body dead
on the Guilder frontier,

08:13.326 --> 08:15.911
his suspicions will be
totally confirmed.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.663
You never said anything
about killing anyone.

08:18.748 --> 08:21.208
I've hired you
to help me start a war.

08:21.292 --> 08:23.043
It's a prestigious
line of work

08:23.127 --> 08:25.253
with a long
and glorious tradition.

08:26.297 --> 08:29.382
I just don't think it's right
killing an innocent girl.

08:29.467 --> 08:31.510
Am I going mad

08:31.594 --> 08:34.679
or did the word "think"
escape your lips?

08:34.764 --> 08:38.517
You were not hired
for your brains,
you hippopotamic landmass!

08:38.601 --> 08:40.184
I agree with Fezzik.

08:40.269 --> 08:42.645
The sot has spoken.

08:42.938 --> 08:45.398
What happens to her is not
truly your concern.

08:45.483 --> 08:48.944
I will kill her.
And remember this.
Never forget this!

08:49.028 --> 08:54.074
When I found you,
you were so slobbering drunk
you couldn't buy brandy!

08:54.158 --> 08:58.036
And you!
Friendless. Brainless.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.247
Helpless! Hopeless!

09:00.331 --> 09:03.625
Do you want me
to send you back
to where you were?

09:03.709 --> 09:06.795
Unemployed? In Greenland?

09:19.600 --> 09:20.934
That Vizzini,

09:21.227 --> 09:24.187
he can fuss.

09:24.438 --> 09:25.855
Fuss. Fuss.

09:26.274 --> 09:29.025
I think he like
to scream at us.

09:29.652 --> 09:32.904
Probably he means no harm.

09:34.240 --> 09:37.951
He's really very short
on charm.

09:38.035 --> 09:40.829
You have
a great gift for rhyme.

09:40.913 --> 09:43.206
Yes. Yes. Some other time.

09:43.291 --> 09:44.708
Enough of that!

09:45.167 --> 09:47.836
Fezzik,
are there rocks ahead?

09:47.920 --> 09:50.255
If there are,
we'll all be dead.

09:50.339 --> 09:52.841
No more rhymes now,
I mean it!

09:52.925 --> 09:54.467
Anybody want a peanut?

10:04.520 --> 10:06.104
We'll reach the cliffs
by dawn.

10:08.399 --> 10:10.025
Why are you doing that?

10:10.109 --> 10:11.860
Are you sure
nobody's follow us?

10:12.194 --> 10:14.529
That would be inconceivable.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.949
Despite what you think,
you will be caught.

10:18.034 --> 10:21.202
And when you are,
the Prince will see
you all hanged.

10:21.287 --> 10:24.080
Of all the necks
on this boat, Highness,

10:24.165 --> 10:26.958
the one you should be
worrying about is your own.

10:31.881 --> 10:35.133
Stop doing that!
We can all relax.
It's almost over.

10:35.217 --> 10:36.926
You are sure
nobody's follow us?

10:37.011 --> 10:38.011
As I told you,

10:38.095 --> 10:42.515
it would be absolutely,
totally and in all other ways
inconceivable.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.517
No one in Guilder knows
what we've done

10:44.602 --> 10:47.896
and no one in Florin
could have gotten here
so fast.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.400
Out of curiosity,
why do you ask?

10:52.652 --> 10:55.570
No reason.
Suddenly, I just happen
to look behind us

10:55.655 --> 10:56.863
and something is there.

10:56.947 --> 10:58.031
What?

11:05.790 --> 11:10.085
Probably some local fisherman
out for a pleasure cruise
at night through

11:10.169 --> 11:12.337
eel-infested waters.

11:13.881 --> 11:16.675
What? Go in! Get after her!

11:16.759 --> 11:17.926
I don't swim.

11:18.719 --> 11:20.261
I only dog paddle.

11:22.264 --> 11:23.973
Veer left!

11:26.936 --> 11:29.104
Left! Left!

11:36.612 --> 11:39.572
Do you know what
that sound is, Highness?

11:39.949 --> 11:42.534
Those are
the shrieking eels!

11:42.618 --> 11:45.036
If you don't believe me,
just wait.

11:45.121 --> 11:50.291
They always grow louder
when they're about to
feed on human flesh!

11:53.629 --> 11:58.591
If you swim back now,
I promise no harm
will come to you.

11:58.676 --> 12:01.970
I doubt you'll get
such an offer
from the eels.

12:11.021 --> 12:14.149
She doesn't get eaten
by the eels at this time.

12:14.900 --> 12:15.900
What?

12:15.985 --> 12:17.360
The eel doesn't get her.

12:17.445 --> 12:20.238
I'm explaining to you
because you look nervous.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.658
I wasn't nervous.

12:24.660 --> 12:29.164
Maybe I was
a little bit concerned,
but that's not the same thing.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.624
Because we can stop now
if you want.

12:31.709 --> 12:35.462
No, you could read
a little bit more if you want.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.507
"Do you know what
that sound is, Highness?

12:39.925 --> 12:41.760
"Those are
the shrieking eels."

12:41.844 --> 12:44.262
We're past that, Grandpa.
You read it already.

12:44.513 --> 12:46.598
Oh. Oh, my goodness.

12:46.682 --> 12:49.851
I did. I'm sorry.
I beg your pardon.

12:50.019 --> 12:53.146
All right. All right.
Let's see,
she was in the water.

12:53.230 --> 12:54.773
The eel was coming after her.

12:54.857 --> 12:58.610
She was frightened.
The eel started to charge her,
and then...

13:01.155 --> 13:03.573
Put her down.
Just put her down.

13:08.370 --> 13:09.996
I think he's getting closer.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.832
He's no concern of ours.
Sail on!

13:13.584 --> 13:15.877
I suppose you think
you're brave, don't you?

13:15.961 --> 13:18.546
Only compared to some.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.721
Look!
He's right on top of us!

13:27.139 --> 13:29.516
I wonder if he is using
the same wind we are using.

13:29.600 --> 13:33.102
Whoever he is,
he's too late. See?

13:35.397 --> 13:37.982
The Cliffs of Insanity!

13:38.067 --> 13:41.486
Hurry up! Move the thing!

13:42.029 --> 13:44.405
And that other thing!

13:45.908 --> 13:47.408
Move it!

13:51.914 --> 13:55.208
We're safe. Only Fezzik
is strong enough
to go up our way.

13:55.292 --> 13:58.419
He'll have to
sail around for hours
till he finds a harbor.

14:43.674 --> 14:47.594
He's climbing the rope
and he's gaining on us.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.762
Inconceivable.

14:52.099 --> 14:53.224
Faster!

14:53.309 --> 14:55.268
I thought
I was going faster.

14:55.352 --> 14:57.437
You were supposed
to be this colossus.

14:57.521 --> 15:01.024
You were this great
legendary thing.
And yet, he gains!

15:01.150 --> 15:04.736
Well,
I'm carrying three people,
and he got only himself.

15:04.820 --> 15:06.112
I do not accept excuses.

15:06.196 --> 15:08.489
I'm just going to have to
find myself a new giant,
that's all.

15:08.657 --> 15:11.492
Don't say that, Vizzini.
Please?

15:16.874 --> 15:21.002
Did I make it clear
that your job is at stake?

16:21.689 --> 16:23.648
He's got very good arms.

16:25.234 --> 16:28.444
He didn't fall?
Inconceivable.

16:29.238 --> 16:30.822
You keep using that word.

16:30.906 --> 16:33.199
I do not think it means
what you think it means.

16:35.244 --> 16:37.912
My God. He's climbing.

16:38.414 --> 16:42.291
Whoever he is, he's obviously
seen us with the Princess
and must, therefore, die.

16:42.376 --> 16:45.336
You, carry her.
We'll head straight
for the Guilder frontier.

16:45.421 --> 16:49.549
Catch up when he's dead.
If he falls, fine.
If not, the sword.

16:49.883 --> 16:51.968
I'm going to duel him
left-handed.

16:52.052 --> 16:54.012
You know
what a hurry we're in!

16:54.096 --> 16:56.180
It's the only way
I can be satisfied.

16:56.265 --> 16:58.850
If I use my right,
over too quickly.

16:58.934 --> 17:00.476
Oh, have it your way.

17:08.193 --> 17:11.404
You be careful.
People in masks
cannot be trusted.

17:12.823 --> 17:14.949
I'm waiting!

17:27.463 --> 17:29.380
Hello there!

17:32.676 --> 17:34.343
Slow going?

17:34.595 --> 17:38.222
Look, I don't mean to be rude,
but this is not
as easy as it looks,

17:38.307 --> 17:40.850
so I'd appreciate it
if you wouldn't distract me.

17:40.934 --> 17:42.852
Sorry.
Thank you.

17:52.321 --> 17:54.906
I don't suppose
you could speed things up?

17:54.990 --> 17:58.659
If you're in such a hurry,
you could lower a rope
or a tree branch,

17:58.744 --> 18:01.120
or find something
useful to do.

18:01.497 --> 18:05.083
I could do that.
I've got some rope up here.

18:05.167 --> 18:07.585
But I do not think
you would accept my help,

18:07.669 --> 18:10.171
since I am only waiting around
to kill you.

18:10.255 --> 18:13.007
That does put a damper
on our relationship.

18:13.133 --> 18:17.595
But I promise
I will not kill you until
you reach the top.

18:17.888 --> 18:21.599
That's very comforting,
but I'm afraid
you'll just have to wait.

18:21.683 --> 18:23.351
I hate waiting.

18:24.394 --> 18:26.354
I could give you my word
as a Spaniard.

18:26.438 --> 18:29.982
No good.
I've known too many Spaniards.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.485
Is there any way
you'll trust me?

18:32.569 --> 18:34.612
Nothing comes to mind.

18:35.072 --> 18:38.324
I swear on the soul
of my father,
Domingo Montoya,

18:38.992 --> 18:40.701
you will reach the top alive.

18:41.411 --> 18:42.995
Throw me the rope.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.235
Thank you.

19:14.695 --> 19:17.155
We'll wait... wait... wait
until you're ready.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.907
Again, thank you.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.256
I do not mean to pry,

19:35.799 --> 19:39.886
but you don't by any chance
happen to have six fingers
on your right hand?

19:41.054 --> 19:43.848
Do you always begin
conversations this way?

19:43.932 --> 19:47.518
My father was slaughtered
by a six-fingered man.

19:53.066 --> 19:55.818
He was a great sword maker,
my father.

19:55.986 --> 19:58.863
When the six-fingered man
appeared and requested
a special sword,

19:58.947 --> 20:00.740
my father took the job.

20:02.367 --> 20:04.994
He slaved a year
before he was done.

20:14.713 --> 20:16.464
I've never seen its equal.

20:17.966 --> 20:20.885
The six-fingered man
returned and demanded it,

20:21.345 --> 20:24.305
but at one-tenth
his promised price.

20:24.681 --> 20:26.891
My father refused.

20:26.975 --> 20:31.145
Without a word,
the six-fingered man
slashed him through the heart.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.898
I loved my father.

20:33.982 --> 20:37.652
So, naturally, I challenged
his murderer to a duel.

20:38.987 --> 20:40.154
I failed.

20:41.698 --> 20:44.533
The six-fingered man
leave me alive.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.495
But he gave me this.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.666
How old were you?

20:51.750 --> 20:53.334
I was 11 years old.

20:54.294 --> 20:56.712
When I was strong enough,

20:56.797 --> 21:00.174
I dedicated my life
to the study of fencing.

21:01.009 --> 21:05.179
So, the next time we meet,
I will not fail.

21:06.556 --> 21:10.226
I will go up
to the six-fingered man
and say,

21:10.310 --> 21:14.188
"Hello. My name
is Inigo Montoya.

21:15.232 --> 21:19.443
"You killed my father.
Prepare to die."

21:21.488 --> 21:24.156
You've done nothing
but study swordplay?

21:24.241 --> 21:26.826
More pursue it
than study, lately.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.161
You see,
I cannot find him.

21:29.246 --> 21:32.373
It has been 20 years now.
I'm starting
to lose confidence.

21:32.708 --> 21:34.917
I just work for Vizzini
to pay the bills.

21:35.002 --> 21:37.044
There's not a lot of money
in revenge.

21:39.381 --> 21:42.216
Well, I certainly hope
you find him someday.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.467
You're ready then?

21:43.552 --> 21:45.261
Whether I am or not,
you've been more than fair.

21:45.345 --> 21:48.723
You seem a decent fellow.
I hate to kill you.

21:48.807 --> 21:51.434
You seem a decent fellow.
I hate to die.

21:52.894 --> 21:54.603
Begin.

22:26.845 --> 22:29.096
You are using
Bonetti's defense
against me, huh?

22:29.181 --> 22:32.058
I thought it fitting,
considering
the rocky terrain.

22:32.142 --> 22:34.894
Naturally,
you must expect me
to attack with Capo Ferro.

22:35.228 --> 22:39.106
Naturally. But I find
that Thibault cancels out
Capo Ferro, don't you?

22:40.609 --> 22:42.651
Unless the enemy
has studied his Agrippa.

22:44.279 --> 22:45.613
Which I have!

22:50.994 --> 22:53.037
You are wonderful.
Thank you.

22:53.121 --> 22:54.705
I've worked hard
to become so.

22:54.790 --> 22:56.707
I admit that you are
better than I am.

22:56.792 --> 22:57.833
Then why are you smiling?

22:57.918 --> 23:00.211
Because I know something
you don't know.

23:00.295 --> 23:01.253
And what is that?

23:01.338 --> 23:02.671
I am not left-handed.

23:14.684 --> 23:15.851
You are amazing.

23:15.936 --> 23:18.187
I ought to be,
after 20 years.

23:18.271 --> 23:20.189
There's something
I ought to tell you.

23:20.273 --> 23:21.315
Tell me.

23:21.775 --> 23:23.526
I'm not left-handed either.

23:50.512 --> 23:52.096
Who are you?

23:52.180 --> 23:53.681
No one of consequence.

23:53.765 --> 23:55.099
I must know.

23:55.183 --> 23:56.851
Get used to disappointment.

23:57.352 --> 23:58.352
Okay.

24:41.188 --> 24:43.105
Kill me quickly.

24:43.190 --> 24:44.982
I would as soon destroy
a stained-glass window

24:45.066 --> 24:46.692
as an artist like yourself.

24:46.776 --> 24:49.653
However, since I can't have
you following me, either...

24:53.408 --> 24:56.243
Please understand, I hold you
in the highest respect.

25:08.215 --> 25:10.758
Inconceivable!
Give her to me.

25:11.092 --> 25:12.426
Catch up with us quickly.

25:12.511 --> 25:13.636
What do I do?

25:13.720 --> 25:16.096
Finish him.
Finish him your way!

25:16.181 --> 25:18.933
Oh, good. My way.
Thank you, Vizzini.

25:19.643 --> 25:21.560
Which one's my way?

25:21.937 --> 25:24.980
Pick up one of those rocks.
Get behind the boulder.

25:25.065 --> 25:27.900
In a few minutes,
the man in black will come
running around the bend.

25:27.984 --> 25:31.779
The minute
his head is in view,
hit it with the rock!

25:33.615 --> 25:36.408
My way's not
very sportsmanlike.

26:05.480 --> 26:09.316
I did that on purpose.
I didn't have to miss.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.110
I believe you.

26:12.070 --> 26:13.654
So what happens now?

26:14.072 --> 26:16.282
We face each other
as God intended.

26:16.366 --> 26:21.829
Sportsmanlike.
No tricks. No weapons.
Skill against skill alone.

26:22.163 --> 26:25.624
You mean,
you'll put down your rock
and I'll put down my sword,

26:25.709 --> 26:28.252
and we'll try
and kill each other
like civilized people?

26:28.336 --> 26:30.713
I can kill you now.

26:30.797 --> 26:35.926
Frankly, I think the odds
are slightly in your favor
at hand-fighting.

26:36.011 --> 26:38.971
It's not my fault
for being the biggest
and the strongest.

26:39.264 --> 26:40.764
I don't even exercise.

27:00.952 --> 27:03.579
Look,
are you just fiddling around
with me, or what?

27:03.663 --> 27:06.081
I just want you to feel
you're doing well.

27:06.166 --> 27:08.292
I hate for people
to die embarrassed.

27:10.712 --> 27:11.962
You're quick.

27:12.047 --> 27:13.130
And a good thing, too.

27:13.214 --> 27:14.548
Why are you wearing a mask?

27:14.633 --> 27:16.842
Were you burned by acid
or something like that?

27:16.926 --> 27:18.802
No, it's just that they're
terribly comfortable.

27:18.887 --> 27:20.929
I think everyone will be
wearing them in the future.

27:24.809 --> 27:28.729
I just figured why
you give me so much trouble.

27:30.565 --> 27:32.775
Why's that, do you think?

27:32.859 --> 27:37.863
Well, I haven't fought
just one person for so long.

27:39.366 --> 27:42.076
I've been specializing
in groups,

27:42.160 --> 27:45.954
battling gangs
for local charities,
that kind of thing.

27:47.957 --> 27:51.460
Why should that make
such a... difference?

27:51.544 --> 27:54.380
Well, you see,
you use different moves

27:54.464 --> 27:58.634
When you're fighting
half a dozen people

27:59.803 --> 28:04.765
than when you only have to be
worried about one.

28:17.946 --> 28:21.115
I do not envy you the headache
you will have when you awake.

28:21.199 --> 28:25.119
But in the meantime,
rest well and dream
of large women.

28:43.304 --> 28:46.640
There was a mighty duel.

28:49.602 --> 28:53.313
It ranged all over.
They were both masters.

28:54.107 --> 28:56.442
Who won? How did it end?

28:56.901 --> 28:59.695
The loser ran off alone,

29:01.531 --> 29:03.115
but the winner

29:03.366 --> 29:06.869
followed those footprints
toward Guilder.

29:07.620 --> 29:09.538
Shall we track them both?

29:09.831 --> 29:13.625
The loser is nothing.
Only the Princess matters.

29:14.502 --> 29:17.171
Clearly, this was all planned
by warriors of Guilder.

29:17.255 --> 29:20.090
We must all be ready
for whatever lies ahead.

29:20.425 --> 29:22.050
Could this be a trap?

29:22.135 --> 29:24.428
I always think
everything could be a trap,

29:24.512 --> 29:26.472
which is why I'm still alive.

29:36.524 --> 29:39.526
So, it is down to you

29:39.986 --> 29:41.779
and it is down to me.

29:44.574 --> 29:47.534
If you wish her dead,
by all means,
keep moving forward.

29:48.995 --> 29:50.287
Let me explain.

29:50.371 --> 29:51.830
There's nothing to explain.

29:51.915 --> 29:54.792
You're trying to kidnap
what I've rightfully stolen.

29:54.876 --> 29:57.711
Perhaps an arrangement
can be reached?

29:57.921 --> 30:01.632
There will be no arrangement,
and you're killing her.

30:04.761 --> 30:07.638
Well, if there can be
no arrangement,
then we are at an impasse.

30:07.722 --> 30:11.725
I'm afraid so. I can't compete
with you physically,

30:11.935 --> 30:14.144
and you're no match
for my brains.

30:14.229 --> 30:15.229
You're that smart?

30:15.313 --> 30:16.396
Let me put it this way.

30:16.481 --> 30:19.775
Have you ever heard of Plato,
Aristotle, Socrates?

30:19.859 --> 30:20.818
Yes.

30:20.902 --> 30:21.944
Morons.

30:22.028 --> 30:23.195
Really?

30:24.072 --> 30:26.907
In that case, I challenge you
to a battle of wits.

30:27.033 --> 30:29.451
For the Princess?

30:29.536 --> 30:31.829
To the death?

30:31.913 --> 30:33.372
I accept.

30:33.456 --> 30:35.582
Good, then pour the wine.

30:50.765 --> 30:53.725
Inhale this,
but do not touch.

30:55.270 --> 30:56.854
I smell nothing.

30:56.938 --> 30:59.356
What you do not smell is
called iocane powder.

30:59.440 --> 31:02.067
It is odorless, tasteless,
dissolves instantly in liquid,

31:02.151 --> 31:04.611
and is among
the more deadly poisons
known to man.

31:04.696 --> 31:05.737
Hmm.

31:27.302 --> 31:30.220
All right.
Where is the poison?

31:30.305 --> 31:32.222
The battle of wits
has begun.

31:32.307 --> 31:34.433
It ends when you decide,
and we both drink

31:34.517 --> 31:38.437
and find out who is right
and who is dead.

31:38.813 --> 31:40.314
But it's so simple.

31:40.398 --> 31:43.692
All I have to do is divine
from what I know of you.

31:43.818 --> 31:45.235
Are you the sort of man

31:45.320 --> 31:48.447
who would put the poison
into his own goblet
or his enemy's?

31:48.531 --> 31:51.408
Now, a clever man
would put the poison
into his own goblet

31:51.492 --> 31:54.745
because he would know
that only a great fool would
reach for what he was given.

31:54.829 --> 31:58.874
I'm not a great fool,
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of you.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.418
But you must have known
I was not a great fool.

32:01.502 --> 32:05.422
You would've counted on it,
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of me.

32:06.049 --> 32:07.215
You've made your decision,
then?

32:07.300 --> 32:08.508
Not remotely.

32:08.676 --> 32:12.095
Because iocane
comes from Australia,
as everyone knows,

32:12.180 --> 32:14.806
and Australia is entirely
peopled with criminals,

32:14.891 --> 32:17.184
and criminals
are used to having people
not trust them,

32:17.268 --> 32:18.769
as you are not trusted by me,

32:18.853 --> 32:21.730
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of you.

32:21.814 --> 32:23.440
Truly, you have
a dizzying intellect.

32:23.524 --> 32:25.442
Wait till I get going.

32:25.526 --> 32:27.402
Where was I?
Australia.

32:27.487 --> 32:28.612
Yes. Australia.

32:28.696 --> 32:31.323
And you must have suspected
I would have known
the powder's origin,

32:31.407 --> 32:33.784
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of me.

32:33.868 --> 32:35.035
You're just stalling now.

32:35.119 --> 32:37.537
You'd like to think that,
wouldn't you?

32:37.705 --> 32:40.707
You've beaten my giant,
which means you're
exceptionally strong,

32:40.792 --> 32:42.793
so you could've put the poison
in your own goblet,

32:42.877 --> 32:44.336
trusting on your strength
to save you,

32:44.462 --> 32:47.130
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of you.

32:47.215 --> 32:51.009
But you've also bested
my Spaniard, which means
you must've studied,

32:51.094 --> 32:54.096
and in studying,
you must have learned
that man is mortal,

32:54.180 --> 32:57.391
so you would've put the poison
as far from yourself
as possible,

32:57.475 --> 33:00.394
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of me.

33:00.478 --> 33:03.647
You're trying to trick me
into giving away something.
It won't work.

33:03.731 --> 33:05.607
It has worked!
You've given everything away.

33:05.692 --> 33:07.192
I know where the poison is.

33:07.276 --> 33:08.443
Then make your choice.

33:08.528 --> 33:10.237
I will, and I choose...

33:10.321 --> 33:12.155
What in the world
can that be?

33:12.240 --> 33:14.157
What? Where?

33:14.784 --> 33:16.493
I don't see anything.

33:16.577 --> 33:18.662
I could've sworn
I saw something.

33:18.746 --> 33:20.497
No matter.

33:22.750 --> 33:24.042
What's so funny?

33:24.127 --> 33:25.919
I'll tell you in a minute.

33:26.087 --> 33:27.838
First, let's drink,

33:27.922 --> 33:31.091
me from my glass
and you from yours.

33:45.440 --> 33:46.523
You guessed wrong.

33:46.607 --> 33:48.316
You only think
I guessed wrong.

33:48.443 --> 33:51.528
That's what's so funny.
I switched glasses
while your back was turned!

33:51.612 --> 33:55.365
You fool,
you fell victim to one
of the classic blunders.

33:55.450 --> 33:58.535
The most famous is
never get involved
in a land war in Asia,

33:58.619 --> 34:01.621
but only slightly less
well known is this.

34:01.706 --> 34:05.876
Never go in against a Sicilian
when death is on the line!

34:20.850 --> 34:21.975
Who are you?

34:22.060 --> 34:23.726
I'm no one to be trifled with.

34:23.811 --> 34:25.853
That is all
you ever need know.

34:26.355 --> 34:29.900
To think, all that time
it was your cup
that was poisoned.

34:29.984 --> 34:31.650
They were both poisoned.

34:32.779 --> 34:36.322
I spent the last few years
building up an immunity
to iocane powder.

34:39.659 --> 34:41.995
Someone has beaten a giant.

34:43.998 --> 34:47.042
There will be great suffering
in Guilder if she dies.

35:02.850 --> 35:03.809
Catch your breath.

35:03.893 --> 35:05.268
If you'll release me,

35:05.520 --> 35:08.772
whatever you ask for ransom,
you'll get it, I promise you.

35:10.942 --> 35:13.693
And what is that worth,
the promise of a woman?

35:13.778 --> 35:15.403
You're very funny, Highness.

35:15.488 --> 35:19.366
I was giving you a chance.
It does not matter
where you take me.

35:19.617 --> 35:21.868
There's no greater hunter
than Prince Humperdinck.

35:21.953 --> 35:25.038
He can track a falcon
on a cloudy day.
He can find you.

35:25.373 --> 35:26.790
You think your dearest love
will save you?

35:26.874 --> 35:28.708
I never said
he was my dearest love,

35:28.793 --> 35:31.294
and yes, he will save me.
That I know.

35:31.963 --> 35:34.548
You admit to me
you do not love your fiancé?

35:35.049 --> 35:36.550
He knows I do not love him.

35:36.634 --> 35:39.094
Are not capable of love,
is what you mean.

35:41.055 --> 35:45.559
I have loved more deeply
than a killer like yourself
could ever dream.

35:47.854 --> 35:49.980
That was a warning,
Highness.

35:50.064 --> 35:51.481
The next time,
my hand flies on its own,

35:51.566 --> 35:54.609
for where I come from,
there are penalties
when a woman lies.

36:00.741 --> 36:03.243
Iocane. I'd bet my life on it.

36:04.078 --> 36:06.288
And there are
the Princess's footprints.

36:06.372 --> 36:09.249
She is alive, or was,
an hour ago.

36:09.959 --> 36:14.379
If she is otherwise
when I find her,
I shall be very put out.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.345
Rest, Highness.

36:22.430 --> 36:23.430
I know who you are.

36:23.514 --> 36:25.724
Your cruelty
reveals everything.

36:25.808 --> 36:27.934
You're the
Dread Pirate Roberts.
Admit it.

36:28.019 --> 36:31.438
With pride.
What can I do for you?

36:31.689 --> 36:34.608
You can die slowly,
cut into a thousand pieces.

36:36.027 --> 36:38.361
Hardly complimentary,
Your Highness.

36:38.446 --> 36:40.405
Why loose your venom on me?

36:41.115 --> 36:43.283
You killed my love.

36:43.409 --> 36:46.995
It's possible.
I kill a lot of people.

36:48.247 --> 36:51.917
Who was this love of yours?
Another prince like this one?

36:52.627 --> 36:54.753
Ugly, rich and scabby?

36:54.837 --> 36:58.173
No, a farm boy. Poor.

36:58.257 --> 37:00.634
Poor and perfect.

37:01.302 --> 37:04.304
With eyes like the sea
after a storm.

37:07.516 --> 37:09.309
On the high seas
your ship attacked,

37:09.393 --> 37:11.686
and the Dread Pirate Roberts
never takes prisoners.

37:11.771 --> 37:13.396
I can't afford
to make exceptions.

37:13.481 --> 37:16.566
I mean, once word leaks out
that a pirate has gone soft,
people begin to disobey you,

37:16.651 --> 37:19.027
and then it's nothing
but work, work, work
all the time.

37:19.111 --> 37:20.487
You mock my pain!

37:20.571 --> 37:22.739
Life is pain, Highness.

37:22.823 --> 37:25.325
Anyone who says differently
is selling something.

37:29.247 --> 37:32.249
I remember this farm boy
of yours, I think.

37:33.125 --> 37:35.252
This would be what?
Five years ago?

37:36.587 --> 37:38.171
Does it bother you to hear?

37:38.714 --> 37:41.049
Nothing you can say
will upset me.

37:42.009 --> 37:44.678
He died well.
That should please you.

37:45.346 --> 37:47.806
No bribe attempts
or blubbering.

37:49.141 --> 37:53.895
He simply said,
"Please. Please,
I need to live."

37:54.897 --> 37:57.023
It was the "please"
that caught my memory.

37:57.900 --> 38:00.360
I asked him what was
so important for him.

38:00.611 --> 38:02.487
"True love," he replied.

38:06.033 --> 38:09.202
And then he spoke of a girl
of surpassing beauty
and faithfulness.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.204
I can only assume
he meant you.

38:11.789 --> 38:13.415
You should bless me
for destroying him

38:13.499 --> 38:16.042
before he found out
what you really are.

38:16.377 --> 38:17.711
And what am I?

38:17.795 --> 38:20.505
Faithfulness
he talked of, madam.
Your enduring faithfulness.

38:20.589 --> 38:22.465
Now tell me truly.
When you found out
he was gone,

38:22.550 --> 38:24.092
did you get engaged
to your prince
that same hour,

38:24.176 --> 38:26.303
or did you wait a whole week
out of respect for the dead?

38:26.387 --> 38:30.557
You mocked me once.
Never do it again!
I died that day!

38:34.687 --> 38:36.730
You can die, too,
for all I care!

38:38.274 --> 38:42.235
As you wish!

38:42.320 --> 38:45.905
Oh, my sweet Westley!
What have I done?

39:05.801 --> 39:09.137
Disappeared.
He must have seen us
closing in.

39:09.221 --> 39:11.890
Which might account
for his panicking into error.

39:12.099 --> 39:14.726
Unless I am wrong,
and I am never wrong,

39:15.436 --> 39:17.896
they are headed dead
into the Fire Swamp.

39:29.867 --> 39:31.034
Can you move at all?

39:31.118 --> 39:33.745
Move? You're alive.

39:34.080 --> 39:36.122
If you want, I can fly.

39:41.128 --> 39:44.172
I told you I would always
come for you.

39:44.256 --> 39:45.799
Why didn't you wait for me?

39:46.342 --> 39:49.052
Well, you were dead.

39:49.470 --> 39:51.721
Death cannot stop true love.

39:53.307 --> 39:55.642
All it can do
is delay it for a while.

39:56.894 --> 39:59.062
I will never doubt again.

40:00.064 --> 40:01.981
There will never be a need.

40:05.486 --> 40:07.862
Oh, no, no, please.

40:08.572 --> 40:10.657
What is it?
What's the matter?

40:10.825 --> 40:14.702
They're kissing again.
Do we have to hear
the kissing part?

40:14.787 --> 40:17.163
Someday, you may not
mind so much.

40:17.748 --> 40:19.666
Skip on to the Fire Swamp.
That sounded good.

40:19.750 --> 40:20.834
Oh.

40:21.961 --> 40:24.170
You're sick.
I'll humor you.

40:25.339 --> 40:27.966
So, now,
where were we here?

40:28.509 --> 40:30.009
Oh, okay.

40:30.678 --> 40:35.056
"Westley and Buttercup
raced along the ravine floor."

40:36.851 --> 40:38.935
Ha! Your pig fiancé
is too late.

40:41.063 --> 40:43.648
A few more steps
and we'll be safe
in the Fire Swamp.

40:44.358 --> 40:45.900
We'll never survive.

40:45.985 --> 40:46.943
Nonsense.

40:47.027 --> 40:49.154
You're only saying that
because no one ever has.

41:16.640 --> 41:18.808
It's not that bad.

41:20.895 --> 41:22.687
I'm not saying
I'd like to build
a summer home here,

41:22.771 --> 41:25.190
but the trees
are actually quite lovely.

42:03.521 --> 42:06.147
Well, now,
that was an adventure.

42:06.232 --> 42:08.066
Singed a bit, were you?

42:08.150 --> 42:09.234
You?

42:16.534 --> 42:18.576
Well, one thing I will say,

42:18.661 --> 42:21.329
the Fire Swamp certainly does
keep you on your toes.

42:27.628 --> 42:30.255
This will all soon be
but a happy memory,

42:30.798 --> 42:33.883
because Roberts' ship,
Revenge, is anchored
at the far end,

42:33.968 --> 42:35.552
and I, as you know,
am Roberts.

42:35.636 --> 42:36.970
But how is that possible,

42:37.054 --> 42:38.680
since he's been
marauding 20 years

42:38.764 --> 42:40.473
and you only left me
five years ago?

42:40.891 --> 42:43.935
I, myself, am often surprised
at life's little quirks.

42:46.772 --> 42:49.649
See, what I told you before
about saying
"please" was true.

42:51.068 --> 42:54.195
It intrigued Roberts,
as did my description
of your beauty.

42:55.364 --> 42:57.448
Finally Roberts
decided something.

42:57.533 --> 42:59.659
He said, "All right, Westley.

42:59.785 --> 43:02.579
"I've never had a valet.
You can try it for tonight.

43:02.663 --> 43:04.914
"I'll most likely kill you
in the morning."

43:04.999 --> 43:06.833
Three years, he said that.

43:06.917 --> 43:08.918
"Good night, Westley.
Good work.

43:09.128 --> 43:11.754
"Sleep well.
I'll most likely kill you
in the morning."

43:11.839 --> 43:14.382
It was a fine time for me.
I was learning
to fence, to fight,

43:14.466 --> 43:16.342
anything anyone
would teach me.

43:16.427 --> 43:18.970
And Roberts and I
eventually became friends.

43:19.096 --> 43:20.388
And then it happened.

43:20.472 --> 43:22.890
What? Go on.

43:23.392 --> 43:26.019
Roberts had grown so rich
he wanted to retire,

43:26.103 --> 43:29.230
so he took me to his cabin
and told me a secret.

43:31.525 --> 43:33.901
"I am not the Dread
Pirate Roberts," he said.

43:33.986 --> 43:35.445
"My name is Ryan.

43:35.529 --> 43:38.114
"I inherited the ship
from the previous
Dread Pirate Roberts,

43:38.198 --> 43:40.199
"just as you
will inherit it from me.

43:40.284 --> 43:43.369
"The man I inherited it from
was not the real
Dread Pirate Roberts either.

43:43.454 --> 43:47.624
"His name was Cummerbund.
The real Roberts has been
retired 15 years

43:47.708 --> 43:49.959
"and living like a king
in Patagonia." Thank you.

43:50.169 --> 43:52.503
Then he explained the name
was the important thing

43:52.588 --> 43:54.505
for inspiring
the necessary fear.

43:54.590 --> 43:58.551
You see,
no one would surrender
to the Dread Pirate Westley.

43:59.470 --> 44:02.180
So, we sailed ashore,
took on an entirely new crew,

44:02.264 --> 44:04.182
and he stayed aboard
for a while, as first mate,

44:04.391 --> 44:06.517
all the time
calling me Roberts.

44:06.602 --> 44:08.728
Once the crew believed,
he left the ship,

44:08.812 --> 44:10.938
and I have been Roberts
ever since.

44:11.231 --> 44:12.774
Except, now
that we're together,

44:12.858 --> 44:15.193
I shall retire
and hand the name over
to someone else.

44:15.486 --> 44:17.070
Is everything clear to you?

45:50.414 --> 45:52.290
We'll never succeed.

45:52.708 --> 45:54.834
We may as well die here.

45:56.628 --> 46:00.381
No. No.
We have already succeeded.

46:02.634 --> 46:05.762
I mean,
what are the three terrors
of the Fire Swamp?

46:06.305 --> 46:09.348
One, the flame spurt.
No problem.

46:09.725 --> 46:12.518
There's a popping sound
preceding each.
We can avoid that.

46:12.603 --> 46:14.645
Two, the lightning sand,

46:14.730 --> 46:16.647
but you were clever enough
to discover
what that looks like,

46:16.732 --> 46:18.566
so in the future,
we can avoid that, too.

46:18.650 --> 46:21.277
Westley, what about
the R.O. U.S. S?

46:21.361 --> 46:23.196
Rodents of Unusual Size?

46:23.363 --> 46:24.614
I don't think they exist.

47:01.527 --> 47:02.985
Westley!

48:16.768 --> 48:18.686
We did it.

48:20.188 --> 48:22.148
Now, was that so terrible?

48:33.160 --> 48:34.452
Surrender.

48:34.536 --> 48:36.037
You mean, you wish
to surrender to me?

48:36.330 --> 48:37.747
Very well. I accept.

48:37.831 --> 48:40.166
I give you
full marks for bravery.

48:40.250 --> 48:42.251
Don't make yourself a fool.

48:42.336 --> 48:43.669
But how will you capture us?

48:43.754 --> 48:45.588
We know the secrets
of the Fire Swamp.

48:45.672 --> 48:47.089
We can live there
quite happily for some time,

48:47.174 --> 48:49.717
so whenever
you feel like dying,
feel free to visit.

48:49.801 --> 48:52.678
I tell you once again,
surrender!

48:52.804 --> 48:54.555
It will not happen.

48:54.640 --> 48:56.307
For the last time, surrender!

48:56.391 --> 48:57.934
Death first!

48:58.018 --> 48:59.769
Will you promise
not to hurt him?

48:59.937 --> 49:02.396
What was that?

49:03.065 --> 49:06.525
If we surrender,
and I return with you,

49:06.610 --> 49:09.111
will you promise
not to hurt this man?

49:09.196 --> 49:12.573
May I live a thousand years
and never hunt again.

49:12.699 --> 49:15.534
He is a sailor
on the pirate ship Revenge.

49:15.619 --> 49:17.954
Promise to return him
to his ship.

49:18.413 --> 49:20.498
I swear it will be done.

49:22.876 --> 49:23.876
Once we are out of sight,

49:23.961 --> 49:27.254
take him back to Florin
and throw him
in the Pit of Despair.

49:27.422 --> 49:29.423
I swear it will be done.

49:30.884 --> 49:34.470
I thought you were dead once,
and it almost destroyed me.

49:35.097 --> 49:39.642
I could not bear it
if you died again,
not when I could save you.

49:52.072 --> 49:53.614
Come, sir.

49:53.907 --> 49:56.200
We must get you to your ship.

50:02.499 --> 50:06.711
We are men of action.
Lies do not become us.

50:07.671 --> 50:10.047
Well spoken, sir.

50:17.431 --> 50:19.140
What is it?

50:19.224 --> 50:21.434
You have six fingers
on your right hand.

50:21.643 --> 50:23.811
Someone was looking for you.

51:08.899 --> 51:10.066
Where am I?

51:10.150 --> 51:12.109
The Pit of Despair.

51:12.486 --> 51:13.903
Don't even think...

51:17.908 --> 51:21.744
Don't even think
about trying to escape.
The chains are far too thick.

51:21.828 --> 51:25.706
And don't dream
of being rescued either.
The only way in is secret.

51:26.249 --> 51:29.543
Only the Prince,
the Count and I know
how to get in and out.

51:30.504 --> 51:32.254
Then I'm here till I die?

51:32.339 --> 51:34.048
Till they kill you, yeah.

51:39.763 --> 51:41.680
Then why bother curing me?

51:41.765 --> 51:43.599
The Prince and the Count
always insist

51:43.683 --> 51:46.185
on everyone being healthy
before they're broken.

51:46.311 --> 51:48.229
So, it's to be torture?

51:49.523 --> 51:51.482
I can cope with torture.

51:54.069 --> 51:55.778
You don't believe me?

51:56.154 --> 51:59.824
You survived the Fire Swamp.
You must be very brave.

51:59.991 --> 52:03.077
But nobody withstands
the machine.

52:17.717 --> 52:19.969
She's been like that
ever since the Fire Swamp.

52:21.054 --> 52:24.723
It's my father's
failing health
that's upsetting her.

52:24.975 --> 52:26.892
Of course.

52:28.770 --> 52:31.522
"The King died
that very night,

52:31.731 --> 52:34.024
"and before
the following dawn,

52:34.109 --> 52:36.694
"Buttercup and Humperdinck
were married.

52:37.070 --> 52:41.282
"And at noon,
she met her subjects again,
this time as their queen."

52:41.366 --> 52:43.576
My father's
final words were...

52:43.660 --> 52:45.578
Hold it. Hold it, Grandpa.

52:45.787 --> 52:48.539
You read that wrong.
She doesn't marry Humperdinck.

52:48.623 --> 52:51.375
She marries Westley.
I'm just sure of it.

52:51.459 --> 52:53.335
After all
that Westley did for her,

52:53.420 --> 52:56.255
if she didn't marry him,
it wouldn't be fair.

52:56.631 --> 52:58.299
Well, who says life is fair?

52:58.383 --> 53:01.635
Where is that written?
Life isn't always fair.

53:02.095 --> 53:04.430
I'm telling you,
you're messing up the story.

53:04.514 --> 53:06.015
Now, get it right!

53:06.099 --> 53:08.184
Do you want me
to go on with this?

53:08.435 --> 53:11.854
Yes.
All right then.
No more interruptions.

53:11.938 --> 53:16.233
"At noon,
she met her subjects again,
this time as their queen."

53:16.735 --> 53:19.778
My father's final words were,

53:19.863 --> 53:22.448
"Love her as I loved her,

53:22.616 --> 53:24.867
"and there will be joy."

53:25.619 --> 53:28.537
I present to you your queen,

53:28.622 --> 53:31.665
Queen Buttercup.

53:42.969 --> 53:44.345
Boo!

53:44.888 --> 53:48.974
Boo!

53:49.184 --> 53:50.809
Why do you do this?

53:50.894 --> 53:54.730
Because you had love
in your hands
and you gave it up!

53:54.814 --> 53:57.233
But they would've
killed Westley
if I hadn't done it.

53:57.317 --> 53:59.652
Your true love lives,

53:59.736 --> 54:01.237
and you marry another!

54:01.321 --> 54:03.989
True love saved her
in the Fire Swamp

54:04.074 --> 54:05.991
and she treated it
like garbage.

54:06.326 --> 54:09.453
And that's what she is,
the queen of refuse!

54:09.537 --> 54:12.581
So bow down to her
if you want, bow to her.

54:12.666 --> 54:16.252
Bow to the queen of slime,
the queen of filth,

54:16.336 --> 54:18.587
the queen of putrescence!

54:18.672 --> 54:20.881
Boo! Boo!

54:20.966 --> 54:23.592
Rubbish! Filth! Slime!

54:23.677 --> 54:26.887
Muck! Boo! Boo!

54:26.972 --> 54:28.430
Boo!

54:31.685 --> 54:33.686
"It was 10 days
till the wedding.

54:33.770 --> 54:38.691
"The King still lived,
but Buttercup's nightmares
were growing steadily worse."

54:38.775 --> 54:42.111
See?
Didn't I tell you she'd never
marry that rotten Humperdinck?

54:42.195 --> 54:44.363
Yes, you're very smart.
Shut up.

54:45.323 --> 54:49.285
It comes to this.
I love Westley.
I always have.

54:49.703 --> 54:51.704
I know now,
I always will.

54:51.913 --> 54:54.790
If you tell me
I must marry you in 10 days,

54:54.874 --> 54:57.459
please believe
I will be dead by morning.

55:04.551 --> 55:07.261
I could never cause you grief.

55:07.887 --> 55:09.847
Consider our wedding off.

55:11.057 --> 55:15.477
You, uh, returned
this Westley to his ship?

55:15.812 --> 55:16.937
Yes.

55:17.022 --> 55:19.023
Then we will
simply alert him.

55:20.066 --> 55:21.567
Beloved,

55:22.402 --> 55:25.195
are you certain
he still wants you?

55:26.072 --> 55:29.616
After all, it was you
who did the leaving
in the Fire Swamp.

55:30.160 --> 55:34.538
Not to mention that, uh,
pirates are not known
to be men of their words.

55:34.622 --> 55:37.166
My Westley
will always come for me.

55:38.543 --> 55:39.877
Uh...

55:43.923 --> 55:45.632
I suggest a deal.

55:45.717 --> 55:48.802
You write four copies
of a letter.

55:48.887 --> 55:52.139
I'll send
my four fastest ships,
one in each direction.

55:52.432 --> 55:55.642
The Dread Pirate Roberts
is always close to Florin
this time of year.

55:55.727 --> 55:58.604
We'll run up the white flag
and deliver your message.

55:58.688 --> 56:01.565
If Westley wants you,
bless you both.

56:03.109 --> 56:04.360
If not,

56:07.447 --> 56:11.241
please consider me
as an alternative
to suicide.

56:12.577 --> 56:13.952
Are we agreed?

56:17.957 --> 56:21.335
Your princess is really
quite a winning creature.

56:21.586 --> 56:24.088
A trifle simple, perhaps,
but her appeal is undeniable.

56:24.172 --> 56:26.298
I know. The people
are quite taken with her.

56:26.508 --> 56:27.841
It's odd,

56:27.926 --> 56:31.095
but when I hired Vizzini
to have her murdered
on our engagement day,

56:31.179 --> 56:32.554
I thought that was clever.

56:32.639 --> 56:34.139
But it's going to be
so much more moving

56:34.224 --> 56:36.683
when I strangle her
on our wedding night.

56:36.768 --> 56:40.104
Once Guilder is blamed,
the nation will be
truly outraged.

56:40.188 --> 56:42.231
They'll demand we go to war.

56:45.360 --> 56:47.945
Now, where is that
secret knot?

56:49.030 --> 56:50.989
It's impossible to find.

56:52.951 --> 56:54.034
Ah!

56:54.369 --> 56:56.578
Are you coming down
into the pit?

56:56.663 --> 56:57.996
Westley's got
his strength back.

56:58.081 --> 57:00.749
I'm starting him
on the machine tonight.

57:00.834 --> 57:02.543
Tyrone,

57:02.627 --> 57:05.045
you know how much I love
watching you work.

57:05.338 --> 57:08.048
But I've got my country's
500th anniversary to plan,

57:08.133 --> 57:10.426
my wedding to arrange,
my wife to murder,

57:10.510 --> 57:13.387
and Guilder to frame for it.
I'm swamped.

57:16.975 --> 57:18.434
Get some rest.

57:18.518 --> 57:21.395
If you haven't got
your health,
you haven't got anything.

57:38.371 --> 57:40.330
Beautiful, isn't it?

57:40.748 --> 57:43.625
Took me half a lifetime
to invent it.

57:44.544 --> 57:48.172
I'm sure you've discovered
my deep and abiding
interest in pain.

57:48.256 --> 57:51.300
At present, I'm writing
the definitive work
on the subject.

57:51.593 --> 57:53.635
So, I want you to be
totally honest with me

57:53.720 --> 57:56.221
on how the machine
makes you feel.

57:56.306 --> 58:00.893
This being our first try,
I'll use the lowest setting.

58:36.429 --> 58:40.474
As you know, the concept
of the suction pump
is centuries old.

58:41.518 --> 58:43.143
Really, that's all this is,

58:43.228 --> 58:47.314
except that instead
of sucking water,
I'm sucking life.

58:47.941 --> 58:50.943
I've just sucked
one year of your life away.

58:51.444 --> 58:54.488
I might one day
go as high as five,

58:54.572 --> 58:56.740
but I really don't know
what that would do to you.

58:56.824 --> 58:59.034
So, let's just start
with what we have.

58:59.661 --> 59:02.496
What did this do to you?
Tell me.

59:02.789 --> 59:06.416
And remember,
this is for posterity,
so be honest.

59:07.043 --> 59:08.502
How do you feel?

59:12.840 --> 59:14.800
Interesting.

59:24.894 --> 59:25.978
Yellin.

59:26.062 --> 59:27.271
Sire.

59:36.990 --> 59:38.865
As Chief Enforcer
of all Florin,

59:38.950 --> 59:41.577
I trust you
with this secret.

59:41.786 --> 59:44.830
Killers from Guilder
are infiltrating
the Thieves' Forest

59:44.914 --> 59:48.959
and plan to murder my bride
on our wedding night.

59:49.627 --> 59:52.796
My spy network has
heard no such news.

59:52.880 --> 59:54.339
Any word from Westley?

59:55.842 --> 59:57.884
Too soon, my ángel.

59:58.428 --> 59:59.511
Patience.

59:59.596 --> 01:00:01.054
He will come for me.

01:00:01.222 --> 01:00:02.556
Of course.

01:00:07.103 --> 01:00:09.271
She will not be murdered!

01:00:09.647 --> 01:00:12.566
On the day of the wedding,
I want the Thieves' Forest
emptied,

01:00:12.650 --> 01:00:14.776
and every inhabitant arrested.

01:00:14.902 --> 01:00:16.987
Many of the thieves
will resist.

01:00:17.071 --> 01:00:19.364
My regular enforcers
will be inadequate.

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:21.533
Form a Brute Squad, then!

01:00:21.659 --> 01:00:24.703
I want the Thieves' Forest
emptied before I wed.

01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:26.622
It won't be easy, sire.

01:00:26.706 --> 01:00:28.707
Try ruling the world sometime.

01:00:33.504 --> 01:00:35.547
"The day
of the wedding arrived.

01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:39.259
"The Brute Squad had
their hands full carrying out
Humperdinck's orders."

01:00:46.434 --> 01:00:47.976
Is everybody out?
Almost.

01:00:48.061 --> 01:00:50.062
There's a Spaniard
giving us some trouble.

01:00:50.271 --> 01:00:52.564
Well, you give him
some trouble.

01:00:53.691 --> 01:00:55.067
Move.

01:00:59.197 --> 01:01:01.657
I am waiting for you, Vizzini.

01:01:02.283 --> 01:01:06.536
You told me to go back
to the beginning, so I have.

01:01:07.205 --> 01:01:10.916
This is where I am
and this is where I'll stay.

01:01:11.834 --> 01:01:13.293
I will not be moved.

01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:15.921
Ho, there!

01:01:16.714 --> 01:01:18.757
I do not budge.
Keep your "Ho, there."

01:01:18.841 --> 01:01:20.926
But the Prince gave orders.

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:24.846
So did Vizzini.

01:01:24.931 --> 01:01:27.349
When a job went wrong,
you went back
to the beginning.

01:01:27.433 --> 01:01:30.769
Well, this is where
we got the job,
so it's the beginning.

01:01:31.229 --> 01:01:33.480
And I am staying
till Vizzini comes.

01:01:33.564 --> 01:01:34.815
You, Brute,
come here!

01:01:34.899 --> 01:01:37.234
I am waiting

01:01:37.318 --> 01:01:39.695
for Vizzini.

01:01:40.613 --> 01:01:42.614
You surely are a meanie.

01:01:50.832 --> 01:01:51.957
Hello.

01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:53.458
It's you.

01:01:53.876 --> 01:01:55.210
True.

01:01:57.171 --> 01:01:58.630
You don't look so good.

01:02:01.259 --> 01:02:03.260
You don't smell
so good either.

01:02:03.344 --> 01:02:06.221
Perhaps not.
I feel fine.

01:02:10.893 --> 01:02:13.478
"Fezzik and Inigo
were reunited.

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:16.982
"And as Fezzik
nursed his inebriated friend
back to health,

01:02:17.066 --> 01:02:18.817
"he told Inigo
of Vizzini's death

01:02:18.901 --> 01:02:20.527
"and the existence
of Count Rugen,

01:02:20.611 --> 01:02:22.320
"the six-fingered man.

01:02:22.655 --> 01:02:24.489
"Considering Inigo's
life-long search,

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:27.284
"he handled the news
surprisingly well.

01:02:29.871 --> 01:02:32.497
"Fezzik took great care
in reviving Inigo."

01:02:33.166 --> 01:02:35.459
That's enough!
That's enough!

01:02:36.043 --> 01:02:39.463
Where is this Rugen now,
so I may kill him?

01:02:39.547 --> 01:02:41.631
He's with the Prince
in the castle.

01:02:41.716 --> 01:02:44.760
But the castle gate
is guarded by 30 men.

01:02:49.348 --> 01:02:51.349
How many could you handle?

01:02:51.684 --> 01:02:53.518
I don't think more than 10.

01:02:58.357 --> 01:03:00.317
Leaving 20 for me.

01:03:01.402 --> 01:03:03.570
At my best, I could
never defeat that many.

01:03:06.866 --> 01:03:09.993
I need Vizzini to plan.
I have no gift for strategy.

01:03:10.536 --> 01:03:12.537
But Vizzini is dead.

01:03:12.705 --> 01:03:15.791
No. Not Vizzini.

01:03:16.667 --> 01:03:18.710
I need the man in black.

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:20.128
What?

01:03:20.213 --> 01:03:23.465
Look. He bested you
with strength, your greatness.

01:03:23.549 --> 01:03:25.634
He bested me with steel.

01:03:25.718 --> 01:03:27.803
He must have
outthought Vizzini.

01:03:27.887 --> 01:03:31.640
And a man who can do that
can plan my castle onslaught
any day.

01:03:31.974 --> 01:03:33.683
Let's go.
Where?

01:03:33.768 --> 01:03:34.976
Find the man in black,
obviously.

01:03:35.061 --> 01:03:36.478
But you don't know
where he is.

01:03:36.562 --> 01:03:38.021
Don't bother me with trifles.

01:03:38.105 --> 01:03:40.816
After 20 years,
at last my father's soul
will be at peace.

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:43.026
There will be blood tonight!

01:03:54.121 --> 01:03:55.789
Rise and report.

01:03:56.082 --> 01:03:57.833
The Thieves' Forest
is emptied.

01:03:57.917 --> 01:03:59.793
Thirty men guard
the castle gate.

01:03:59.877 --> 01:04:03.338
Double it.
My princess must be safe.

01:04:03.422 --> 01:04:05.340
The gate has but one key.

01:04:06.759 --> 01:04:08.677
And I carry that.

01:04:11.138 --> 01:04:14.349
Ah! My dulcet darling.

01:04:16.185 --> 01:04:18.311
Tonight, we marry.

01:04:18.437 --> 01:04:21.690
Tomorrow morning,
your men will escort us
to Florin Channel,

01:04:21.899 --> 01:04:26.778
where every ship in my armada
waits to accompany us
on our honeymoon.

01:04:27.446 --> 01:04:29.948
Every ship
but your four fastest,
you mean.

01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:34.786
Every ship
but the four you sent.

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:38.957
Yes. Yes, of course.
Naturally, not those four.

01:04:40.918 --> 01:04:42.669
Your Majesty.

01:04:46.299 --> 01:04:48.300
You never sent the ships.

01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:50.343
Don't bother lying.

01:04:51.262 --> 01:04:54.389
It doesn't matter.
Westley will come
for me anyway.

01:04:54.473 --> 01:04:56.141
You're a silly girl.

01:04:56.225 --> 01:04:58.184
Yes, I am a silly girl,

01:04:58.269 --> 01:05:00.937
for not having seen sooner
that you are nothing
but a coward

01:05:01.022 --> 01:05:02.689
with a heart full of fear.

01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:07.819
I would not say such things
if I were you.

01:05:08.154 --> 01:05:11.156
Why not? You can't hurt me.

01:05:11.866 --> 01:05:14.701
Westley and I are joined
by the bonds of love.

01:05:15.077 --> 01:05:16.912
And you cannot track that,

01:05:16.996 --> 01:05:19.039
not with
a thousand bloodhounds.

01:05:19.457 --> 01:05:22.959
And you cannot break it,
not with a thousand swords.

01:05:23.336 --> 01:05:25.670
And when I say
you're a coward,

01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:30.133
that is only because
you are the slimiest weakling
ever to crawl the earth!

01:05:31.928 --> 01:05:35.347
I would not say
such things if I were you!

01:05:50.488 --> 01:05:54.032
You truly love each other,
and so you might have been
truly happy.

01:05:54.283 --> 01:05:56.618
Not one couple in a century
has that chance,

01:05:56.702 --> 01:05:58.703
no matter what
the storybooks say.

01:05:58.996 --> 01:06:01.957
And so,
I think no man in a century

01:06:02.041 --> 01:06:04.542
will suffer as greatly
as you will.

01:06:07.922 --> 01:06:09.172
Not to 50!

01:06:30.861 --> 01:06:33.238
Fezzik. Fezzik, listen.

01:06:33.572 --> 01:06:34.823
Do you hear?

01:06:34.907 --> 01:06:37.617
That is the sound
of ultimate suffering.

01:06:37.702 --> 01:06:41.121
My heart made that sound
when Rugen slaughtered
my father.

01:06:41.247 --> 01:06:42.622
The man in black
makes it now.

01:06:42.707 --> 01:06:43.873
The man in black?

01:06:43.958 --> 01:06:45.917
His true love is marrying
another tonight,

01:06:46.043 --> 01:06:48.461
so who else has the cause
for ultimate suffering?

01:06:48.629 --> 01:06:52.465
Excuse me. Pardon me,
it's important.
Fezzik, please.

01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:54.884
Everybody, move!

01:06:55.177 --> 01:06:56.636
Thank you.

01:07:04.770 --> 01:07:07.022
Where is the man in black?

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:09.941
You get there
from this grove, yes?

01:07:11.235 --> 01:07:14.112
Fezzik, jog his memory.

01:07:19.410 --> 01:07:22.495
I'm sorry, Inigo.
I didn't meant to jog him
so hard.

01:07:23.205 --> 01:07:24.789
Inigo?

01:07:26.167 --> 01:07:30.378
Father, I have failed you
for 20 years.

01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:33.506
Now, our misery can end.

01:07:33.924 --> 01:07:35.550
Somewhere...

01:07:35.926 --> 01:07:38.970
Somewhere close by
is a man who can help us.

01:07:40.806 --> 01:07:45.060
I cannot find him alone.
I need you.

01:07:46.562 --> 01:07:49.147
I need you to guide my sword.

01:07:49.648 --> 01:07:51.149
Please.

01:07:53.110 --> 01:07:55.153
Guide my sword.

01:08:45.371 --> 01:08:46.703
He's dead.

01:08:47.081 --> 01:08:49.499
Just is not fair.

01:08:49.582 --> 01:08:52.669
Grandpa, Grandpa,
wait. Wait.

01:08:52.752 --> 01:08:54.921
What did Fezzik mean,
"He's dead"?

01:08:55.005 --> 01:08:57.715
I mean, he didn't mean "dead."

01:08:59.051 --> 01:09:02.178
Westley's only faking, right?

01:09:02.763 --> 01:09:05.140
You want me
to read this or not?

01:09:05.474 --> 01:09:07.433
Who gets Humperdinck?

01:09:07.518 --> 01:09:09.144
I don't understand.

01:09:09.395 --> 01:09:11.312
Who kills Prince Humperdinck?

01:09:11.397 --> 01:09:13.564
At the end?
Somebody's gotta do it.

01:09:13.732 --> 01:09:15.649
Is it Inigo? Who?

01:09:15.734 --> 01:09:18.278
Nobody. Nobody kills him.

01:09:18.362 --> 01:09:20.071
He lives.

01:09:20.156 --> 01:09:21.698
You mean, he wins?

01:09:21.907 --> 01:09:24.701
Jesus, Grandpa,
what did you read me
this thing for?

01:09:25.618 --> 01:09:27.370
You know,
you've been very sick

01:09:27.453 --> 01:09:29.413
and you're taking this story
very seriously.

01:09:29.497 --> 01:09:31.916
I think we ought to
stop now.

01:09:32.751 --> 01:09:34.919
No, I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:09:35.212 --> 01:09:37.714
Sit down. I'm all right.

01:09:38.883 --> 01:09:40.258
Okay.

01:09:40.551 --> 01:09:42.801
All right, now, let's see.
Where were we?

01:09:42.886 --> 01:09:45.388
Oh, yes.

01:09:45.973 --> 01:09:48.265
In the Pit of Despair.

01:09:50.728 --> 01:09:52.020
Well...

01:09:52.438 --> 01:09:54.814
The Montoyas have
never taken defeat easily.

01:09:54.899 --> 01:09:56.816
Come along, Fezzik.
Bring the body.

01:09:56.901 --> 01:09:58.109
The body?

01:09:58.736 --> 01:10:00.236
Have you any money?

01:10:00.321 --> 01:10:01.571
I have a little.

01:10:01.947 --> 01:10:05.116
I just hope it's enough
to buy a miracle, that's all.

01:10:09.455 --> 01:10:10.955
Go away!

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:15.877
What? What?

01:10:15.961 --> 01:10:18.796
Are you the Miracle Max
who worked for the King
all those years?

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:20.924
The King's
stinking son fired me,

01:10:21.008 --> 01:10:23.760
and thank you so much
for bringing up
such a painful subject.

01:10:23.844 --> 01:10:25.595
While you're at it,
why don't you give me
a nice paper cut

01:10:25.679 --> 01:10:26.846
and pour lemon juice on it?

01:10:26.931 --> 01:10:28.223
We're closed!

01:10:32.102 --> 01:10:33.728
Beat it, or I'll call
the Brute Squad.

01:10:33.812 --> 01:10:35.230
I'm on the Brute Squad.

01:10:35.314 --> 01:10:36.898
You are the Brute Squad.

01:10:36.982 --> 01:10:39.234
We need a miracle.
It's very important.

01:10:39.318 --> 01:10:41.569
Look, I'm retired.
And besides,

01:10:41.654 --> 01:10:43.947
why would you want someone
the King's stinking son fired?

01:10:44.031 --> 01:10:46.199
I might kill whoever
you wanted me to miracle.

01:10:46.283 --> 01:10:48.201
He's already dead.

01:10:48.285 --> 01:10:51.287
He is, huh? I'll take a look.
Bring him in.

01:11:05.761 --> 01:11:07.512
I've seen worse.

01:11:12.726 --> 01:11:14.143
Sir?

01:11:15.187 --> 01:11:16.562
Sir?
Huh?

01:11:16.647 --> 01:11:18.606
We're in a terrible rush.

01:11:18.691 --> 01:11:22.360
Don't rush me, sonny.
You rush a miracle man,
you get rotten miracles.

01:11:22.736 --> 01:11:23.861
You got money?

01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:25.029
Sixty-five.

01:11:25.239 --> 01:11:27.949
I never worked for so little,

01:11:28.033 --> 01:11:30.451
except once, and that was
a very noble cause.

01:11:30.536 --> 01:11:32.745
This is noble, sir.

01:11:33.330 --> 01:11:36.040
His wife is crippled.

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:39.502
His children are
on the brink of starvation.

01:11:40.212 --> 01:11:41.796
Are you a rotten liar.

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:45.800
I need him
to help avenge my father,
murdered these 20 years.

01:11:45.884 --> 01:11:48.636
Your first story was better.
Where's that bellows cranny?

01:11:48.721 --> 01:11:51.723
He probably
owes you money, huh?
Well, I'll ask him.

01:11:52.016 --> 01:11:53.891
He's dead. He can't talk.

01:11:55.352 --> 01:11:57.186
Look who knows so much, huh.

01:11:57.271 --> 01:12:01.357
Well, it just so happens
that your friend here
is only mostly dead.

01:12:01.442 --> 01:12:04.610
There's a big difference
between mostly dead
and all dead.

01:12:04.695 --> 01:12:06.112
Please, open his mouth.

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:11.659
Now, mostly dead
is slightly alive.

01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:14.829
Now, all dead...
Well, with all dead,

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:16.998
there's usually only one thing
that you can do.

01:12:17.082 --> 01:12:18.207
What's that?

01:12:18.292 --> 01:12:20.752
Go through his clothes
and look for loose change.

01:12:26.467 --> 01:12:27.467
Hey!

01:12:27.926 --> 01:12:30.428
Hello in there! Hey!

01:12:30.512 --> 01:12:35.058
What's so important?
What you got here
that's worth living for?

01:12:38.854 --> 01:12:40.646
True

01:12:40.731 --> 01:12:42.482
love.

01:12:42.858 --> 01:12:44.359
True love. You heard him.

01:12:44.443 --> 01:12:46.402
You could not ask for
a more noble cause than that.

01:12:46.487 --> 01:12:50.865
Sonny, true love is
the greatest thing
in the world,

01:12:50.949 --> 01:12:52.367
except for a nice M.L.T.

01:12:52.451 --> 01:12:53.826
A mutton, lettuce
and tomato sandwich

01:12:53.911 --> 01:12:55.745
when the mutton
is nice and lean

01:12:55.829 --> 01:12:57.121
and the tomato is ripe.

01:12:57.247 --> 01:12:59.457
They're so perky. I love that.

01:12:59.541 --> 01:13:03.127
But that's not what he said.
He distinctly said,
"To blave."

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:06.506
And as we all know,
"to blave" means "to bluff."
Huh?

01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:08.383
So you're probably
playing cards
and he cheated...

01:13:08.467 --> 01:13:10.218
Liar! Liar!

01:13:10.302 --> 01:13:11.969
Liar!

01:13:12.054 --> 01:13:13.054
Get back, witch!

01:13:13.138 --> 01:13:14.305
I'm not a witch,
I'm your wife!

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:15.723
But after what
you just said,

01:13:15.808 --> 01:13:18.101
I'm not even sure
I want to be that anymore.

01:13:18.185 --> 01:13:19.435
You never had it so good.

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:21.062
"True love."
He said "true love," Max.

01:13:21.146 --> 01:13:22.814
Don't say another word,
Valerie.

01:13:22.898 --> 01:13:26.818
He's afraid. Ever since
Prince Humperdinck fired him,
his confidence is shattered.

01:13:26.902 --> 01:13:29.946
Why'd you say that name?
You promised me that
you'd never say that name!

01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:31.072
What, Humperdinck?

01:13:31.156 --> 01:13:33.825
Humperdinck! Humperdinck!
Humperdinck!

01:13:34.493 --> 01:13:35.660
Humperdinck! Humperdinck!

01:13:35.744 --> 01:13:37.078
I'm not listening!

01:13:37.162 --> 01:13:38.996
True love lies expiring,

01:13:39.164 --> 01:13:42.083
And you don't have the decency
to say why you won't help.

01:13:42.167 --> 01:13:43.292
Nobody's hearing nothing.

01:13:43.377 --> 01:13:44.627
Humperdinck! Humperdinck!

01:13:44.711 --> 01:13:46.129
This is Buttercup's true love.

01:13:46.213 --> 01:13:48.923
If you heal him, he will
stop Humperdinck's wedding.

01:13:49.007 --> 01:13:50.049
Humperdinck!

01:13:50.134 --> 01:13:51.175
Wait, wait.

01:13:51.301 --> 01:13:53.219
I make him better,
Humperdinck suffers?

01:13:53.303 --> 01:13:56.013
Humiliations galore.

01:13:59.685 --> 01:14:02.728
That is a noble cause.
Give me the 65.
I'm on the job.

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:09.610
That's a miracle pill?

01:14:09.695 --> 01:14:12.113
The chocolate coating
makes it go down easier.

01:14:12.197 --> 01:14:15.616
But you have to wait
15 minutes for full potency.

01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:18.953
And you shouldn't go in
swimming after for at least...
What?

01:14:19.037 --> 01:14:20.788
An hour. A good hour.
Yeah, an hour.

01:14:20.873 --> 01:14:22.081
Thank you for everything.

01:14:22.166 --> 01:14:23.207
Okay.

01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:25.168
Bye-bye, boys.

01:14:25.252 --> 01:14:27.128
Have fun
storming the castle.

01:14:27.212 --> 01:14:28.212
Think it'll work?

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:29.297
It would
take a miracle.

01:14:29.381 --> 01:14:31.048
Bye-bye!
Bye!

01:14:43.770 --> 01:14:46.439
Inigo, there's more than 30.

01:14:46.523 --> 01:14:48.107
What's the difference?

01:14:48.817 --> 01:14:52.236
We've got him. Help me here.

01:14:53.071 --> 01:14:54.614
We'll have to
force-feed him.

01:14:54.698 --> 01:14:55.823
Has it been 15 minutes?

01:14:55.908 --> 01:14:56.949
We can't wait.

01:14:57.034 --> 01:14:58.493
The wedding's
in half an hour.

01:14:58.577 --> 01:15:00.786
We must strike in the hustle
and the bustle beforehand.

01:15:00.871 --> 01:15:02.538
Tilt his head back.

01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:05.124
Open his mouth.

01:15:09.254 --> 01:15:12.798
How long do we have to wait
before if we know
if the miracle works?

01:15:12.883 --> 01:15:14.258
Your guess is
as good as mine.

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:16.427
I'll beat you at your part.
I'll take you both together!

01:15:17.054 --> 01:15:18.763
I guess not very long.

01:15:19.973 --> 01:15:21.807
Why won't my arms move?

01:15:21.892 --> 01:15:23.851
You've been
mostly dead all day.

01:15:23.936 --> 01:15:27.271
We had Miracle Max
make a pill
to bring you back.

01:15:27.773 --> 01:15:30.858
Who are you?
Are we enemies?

01:15:30.943 --> 01:15:33.528
Why am I on this wall?
Where is Buttercup?

01:15:33.612 --> 01:15:35.029
Let me explain.

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:37.281
No, there is too much.
Let me sum up.

01:15:37.449 --> 01:15:40.201
Buttercup is marrying
Humperdinck in a little less
than half an hour,

01:15:40.327 --> 01:15:42.537
so all we have to do is
get in, break up the wedding,

01:15:42.621 --> 01:15:46.040
steal the princess,
make our escape.
After I kill Count Rugen.

01:15:46.124 --> 01:15:48.543
That doesn't leave much time
for dilly-dallying.

01:15:48.627 --> 01:15:51.879
You just wiggled your finger.
That's wonderful.

01:15:51.964 --> 01:15:54.924
I've always been
a quick healer.
What are our liabilities?

01:15:55.008 --> 01:15:58.469
There is but one
working castle gate.
Come on.

01:16:01.723 --> 01:16:04.559
And it is guarded by 60 men.

01:16:04.643 --> 01:16:05.601
And our assets?

01:16:05.686 --> 01:16:08.938
Your brains,
Fezzik's strength,
my steel.

01:16:09.022 --> 01:16:10.940
That's it? Lmpossible.

01:16:12.109 --> 01:16:15.319
If I had a month to plan,
maybe I could come up
with something, but this...

01:16:15.571 --> 01:16:18.990
You just shook your head.
That doesn't make you happy?

01:16:22.452 --> 01:16:26.664
My brains, his steel
and your strength
against 60 men,

01:16:26.748 --> 01:16:30.293
and you think a little
head jiggle is supposed
to make me happy? Hmm?

01:16:31.169 --> 01:16:34.005
If we only had a wheelbarrow,
that would be something.

01:16:35.048 --> 01:16:37.300
Where did we put
the wheelbarrow
the albino had?

01:16:37.384 --> 01:16:39.760
Over the albino, I think.

01:16:39.845 --> 01:16:42.930
Why didn't you list that
among our assets
in the first place?

01:16:45.183 --> 01:16:46.976
What I wouldn't give
for a holocaust cloak.

01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:49.061
There, we cannot help you.

01:16:49.605 --> 01:16:51.230
Will this do?

01:16:51.315 --> 01:16:52.440
Where did you get that?

01:16:52.524 --> 01:16:53.774
At Miracle Max's.

01:16:53.859 --> 01:16:56.027
It fit so nice,
he said I could keep it.

01:16:56.111 --> 01:16:58.362
All right, all right.
Come on. Help me up.

01:17:01.033 --> 01:17:03.117
Now, I'll need
a sword, eventually.
Why?

01:17:03.201 --> 01:17:04.368
You can't even lift one.

01:17:04.536 --> 01:17:07.204
True, but that's hardly
common knowledge, is it?

01:17:07.289 --> 01:17:11.083
Thank you. Now,
there may be problems
once we're inside.

01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:13.836
I'll say.
How do I find the Count?

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:15.212
Once I do,
how do I find you again?

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:17.048
Once I find you again,
how do we escape?

01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:19.800
Don't pester him.
He's had a hard day.

01:17:19.885 --> 01:17:22.553
Right. Right. Sorry.

01:17:26.725 --> 01:17:28.267
Inigo.
What?

01:17:28.727 --> 01:17:30.478
I hope we win.

01:17:31.313 --> 01:17:33.689
You don't seem excited,
my little muffin.

01:17:34.274 --> 01:17:35.358
Should I be?

01:17:35.442 --> 01:17:37.902
Brides often are,
I'm told.

01:17:38.236 --> 01:17:40.488
I do not marry tonight.

01:17:41.448 --> 01:17:43.074
My Westley will save me.

01:18:35.836 --> 01:18:37.795
Marriage.

01:18:37.879 --> 01:18:41.674
Marriage is what
brings us together

01:18:41.925 --> 01:18:43.300
today.

01:18:43.802 --> 01:18:47.763
Marriage,
that blessed arrangement,

01:18:48.306 --> 01:18:50.015
that dream

01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:52.560
within a dream.

01:18:52.853 --> 01:18:56.313
Stand your ground, men!
Stand your ground!

01:19:01.153 --> 01:19:02.820
Stand your ground!

01:19:03.071 --> 01:19:06.741
I am the Dread Pirate Roberts!

01:19:08.118 --> 01:19:11.746
There will be no survivors!

01:19:12.122 --> 01:19:13.956
Now?
Not yet.

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:17.835
My men are here, I am here,

01:19:18.503 --> 01:19:22.214
but soon you will not be here.

01:19:22.841 --> 01:19:24.508
Now!
Light him.

01:19:27.637 --> 01:19:29.847
The Dread Pirate Roberts

01:19:30.098 --> 01:19:32.808
takes no survivors.

01:19:32.893 --> 01:19:35.519
All your worst nightmares

01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:38.105
are about to come true!

01:19:38.648 --> 01:19:40.608
Then love,

01:19:40.692 --> 01:19:42.860
true love,

01:19:43.111 --> 01:19:45.362
will follow you

01:19:45.655 --> 01:19:47.948
forever.

01:19:48.033 --> 01:19:50.701
The Dread Pirate Roberts

01:19:50.786 --> 01:19:54.455
Is here for your souls!

01:19:56.875 --> 01:19:59.877
Stay where you are!
Stand and fight.

01:20:00.212 --> 01:20:02.213
Stay where you are!

01:20:06.510 --> 01:20:09.011
So treasure your love...

01:20:09.095 --> 01:20:10.721
Skip to the end.

01:20:11.056 --> 01:20:12.640
Have you the ring?

01:20:14.726 --> 01:20:16.477
Here comes my Westley now.

01:20:16.561 --> 01:20:18.521
Fezzik, the portcullis!

01:20:24.402 --> 01:20:26.779
Your Westley is dead.

01:20:26.863 --> 01:20:27.947
I killed him myself.

01:20:28.031 --> 01:20:30.407
Then why is there fear
behind your eyes?

01:20:34.996 --> 01:20:36.580
Give us the gate key.

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:38.833
I have no gate key.

01:20:38.917 --> 01:20:41.293
Fezzik, tear his arms off.

01:20:41.378 --> 01:20:43.796
Oh, you mean this gate key.

01:20:44.256 --> 01:20:47.216
And do you,
Princess Buttercup...

01:20:47.342 --> 01:20:50.261
Man and wife!
Say, "Man and wife!"

01:20:50.595 --> 01:20:52.555
Man and wife.

01:20:53.265 --> 01:20:56.600
Escort the bride
to the honeymoon suite.
I'll be there shortly.

01:20:58.562 --> 01:21:00.145
He didn't come.

01:21:34.639 --> 01:21:36.807
Kill the dark one
and the giant,

01:21:36.892 --> 01:21:39.351
but leave the third
for questioning.

01:21:50.655 --> 01:21:54.325
Hello.
My name is Inigo Montoya.

01:21:55.327 --> 01:21:59.163
You killed my father.
Prepare to die.

01:22:23.521 --> 01:22:26.231
Fezzik! I need you!

01:22:26.316 --> 01:22:27.942
I can't leave him alone.

01:22:28.026 --> 01:22:31.528
He's getting away from me,
Fezzik! Please!

01:22:33.073 --> 01:22:34.406
Fezzik!

01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:38.577
I'll be right back.

01:22:46.544 --> 01:22:48.087
Thank you.

01:22:49.214 --> 01:22:50.965
Strange wedding.

01:22:51.049 --> 01:22:53.509
Yes, a very strange wedding.

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:56.303
Come along.

01:23:02.352 --> 01:23:03.811
What was that for?

01:23:03.895 --> 01:23:06.146
Because you've always been
so kind to me.

01:23:06.231 --> 01:23:07.982
And I won't be
seeing you again,

01:23:08.066 --> 01:23:11.276
since I'm killing myself
once we reach
the honeymoon suite.

01:23:11.569 --> 01:23:14.989
Won't that be nice?
She kissed me!

01:24:02.454 --> 01:24:04.538
Sorry, Father.

01:24:05.331 --> 01:24:09.043
I tried.

01:24:10.587 --> 01:24:12.713
You must be
that little Spanish brat

01:24:12.797 --> 01:24:15.507
I taught a lesson to
all those years ago.

01:24:16.009 --> 01:24:18.469
Simply incredible.

01:24:18.636 --> 01:24:22.014
Have you been chasing me
your whole life,
only to fail now?

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:25.809
I think that's the worst thing
I've ever heard.

01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:28.479
How marvelous.

01:25:05.683 --> 01:25:08.352
There's a shortage
of perfect breasts
in this world.

01:25:08.853 --> 01:25:10.813
It would be a pity
to damage yours.

01:25:11.481 --> 01:25:14.233
Westley!
Oh, Westley, darling!

01:25:16.986 --> 01:25:20.322
Westley,
why won't you hold me?

01:25:20.448 --> 01:25:21.573
Gently.

01:25:21.658 --> 01:25:22.825
At a time like this?

01:25:22.909 --> 01:25:25.702
That's all you can
think to say? "Gently"?

01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:27.204
Gently!

01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:44.388
Good heavens.
Are you still trying to win?

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:50.811
You've got an overdeveloped
sense of vengeance.

01:25:51.479 --> 01:25:54.231
It's going to get you
into trouble someday.

01:26:07.704 --> 01:26:11.498
Hello.
My name is Inigo Montoya.

01:26:12.041 --> 01:26:14.334
You killed my father.

01:26:14.419 --> 01:26:16.378
Prepare to die.

01:26:22.135 --> 01:26:26.180
Hello.
My name is Inigo Montoya.

01:26:26.264 --> 01:26:28.348
You killed my father.

01:26:28.766 --> 01:26:30.559
Prepare to die.

01:26:34.272 --> 01:26:37.065
Hello!
My name is Inigo Montoya.

01:26:37.150 --> 01:26:39.693
You killed my father.
Prepare to die.

01:26:40.069 --> 01:26:41.820
Stop saying that!

01:26:45.825 --> 01:26:48.452
Hello!
My name is Inigo Montoya!

01:26:48.536 --> 01:26:49.995
You killed my father!

01:26:50.079 --> 01:26:51.955
Prepare to die.
No!

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:53.790
Offer me money.
Yes.

01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:56.001
Power, too.
Promise me that.

01:26:56.085 --> 01:26:58.879
All that I have and more.
Please.

01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:01.715
Offer me everything I ask for.

01:27:01.799 --> 01:27:03.800
Anything you want.

01:27:05.970 --> 01:27:08.805
I want my father back,
you son of a bitch.

01:27:23.863 --> 01:27:26.156
Westley,
will you ever forgive me?

01:27:26.324 --> 01:27:28.492
What hideous sin
have you committed lately?

01:27:28.868 --> 01:27:32.537
I got married.
I didn't want to.
It all happened so fast.

01:27:32.622 --> 01:27:34.081
It never happened.
What?

01:27:34.165 --> 01:27:35.165
It never happened.

01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:36.416
But it did. I was there.

01:27:36.501 --> 01:27:37.960
This old man said,
"Man and wife."

01:27:38.044 --> 01:27:39.753
Did you say, "I do"?

01:27:40.838 --> 01:27:43.715
No. We sort of
skipped that part.

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:45.259
Then you're not married.

01:27:45.885 --> 01:27:48.220
If you didn't say it,
you didn't do it.

01:27:49.555 --> 01:27:52.099
Wouldn't you agree,
Your Highness?

01:27:52.475 --> 01:27:55.978
A technicality that will
shortly be remedied.

01:27:57.230 --> 01:27:59.189
But first things first.

01:28:01.693 --> 01:28:03.652
To the death.
No!

01:28:03.987 --> 01:28:05.529
To the pain.

01:28:07.323 --> 01:28:09.366
I don't think
I'm quite familiar
with that phrase.

01:28:09.450 --> 01:28:10.659
I'll explain.

01:28:10.743 --> 01:28:13.870
And I'll use small words,
so that you'll be sure
to understand,

01:28:13.955 --> 01:28:16.707
you warthog-faced buffoon.

01:28:18.042 --> 01:28:22.921
That may be
the first time in my life
a man has dared insult me.

01:28:23.256 --> 01:28:24.965
It won't be the last.

01:28:25.633 --> 01:28:27.092
"To the pain" means
the first thing you lose

01:28:27.176 --> 01:28:29.469
will be your feet,
below the ankles.

01:28:29.554 --> 01:28:33.390
Then your hands at the wrists.
Next, your nose.

01:28:33.516 --> 01:28:37.352
And then my tongue, I suppose?
I killed you too quickly
the last time,

01:28:37.437 --> 01:28:40.480
a mistake I don't mean
to duplicate tonight.

01:28:40.565 --> 01:28:41.857
I wasn't finished!

01:28:42.066 --> 01:28:44.860
The next thing you lose
will be your left eye,
followed by your right.

01:28:44.944 --> 01:28:48.155
And then my ears.
I understand.
Let's get on with it.

01:28:48.239 --> 01:28:51.867
Wrong! Your ears you keep,
and I'll tell you why.

01:28:53.578 --> 01:28:56.997
So that every shriek
of every child at seeing
your hideousness

01:28:57.081 --> 01:28:58.915
will be yours to cherish.

01:28:59.584 --> 01:29:01.752
Every babe that weeps
at your approach,

01:29:01.836 --> 01:29:04.671
every woman who cries out,
"Dear, God,
what is that thing?"

01:29:04.756 --> 01:29:07.591
Will echo
in your perfect ears.

01:29:08.468 --> 01:29:10.594
That is what
"to the pain" means.

01:29:10.678 --> 01:29:12.763
It means I leave you
in anguish,

01:29:13.222 --> 01:29:16.600
wallowing in freakish
misery forever.

01:29:18.936 --> 01:29:20.687
I think you're bluffing.

01:29:20.772 --> 01:29:22.564
It's possible, pig.

01:29:22.648 --> 01:29:24.399
I might be bluffing.

01:29:24.734 --> 01:29:27.736
It's conceivable,
you miserable, vomitous mass,

01:29:27.820 --> 01:29:30.906
that I'm only lying here
because I lack the strength
to stand.

01:29:32.116 --> 01:29:33.784
Then again,

01:29:34.744 --> 01:29:37.120
perhaps I have
the strength after all.

01:29:53.388 --> 01:29:56.807
Drop your sword.

01:30:01.312 --> 01:30:02.813
Have a seat.

01:30:07.235 --> 01:30:08.819
Tie him up.

01:30:09.987 --> 01:30:11.863
Make it as tight
as you like.

01:30:12.281 --> 01:30:13.573
Oh.

01:30:16.494 --> 01:30:18.078
Where's Fezzik?

01:30:18.162 --> 01:30:20.247
I thought
he was with you.
No.

01:30:20.331 --> 01:30:21.832
In that case...

01:30:22.458 --> 01:30:23.500
Help him.

01:30:23.584 --> 01:30:25.669
Why does Westley
need helping?

01:30:25.753 --> 01:30:27.170
Because he has
no strength.

01:30:27.338 --> 01:30:29.923
I knew it.
I knew you were bluffing!
I knew he was bluffing.

01:30:30.007 --> 01:30:31.842
Shall I dispatch him
for you?

01:30:31.926 --> 01:30:33.593
Thank you, but no.
Whatever happens to us,

01:30:33.678 --> 01:30:36.513
I want him to live
a long life, alone
with his cowardice.

01:30:37.056 --> 01:30:38.306
Inigo!

01:30:38.850 --> 01:30:41.518
Inigo, where are you?

01:30:42.770 --> 01:30:44.771
Oh, there you are.

01:30:44.856 --> 01:30:47.607
Inigo, I saw
the prince's stables.

01:30:47.692 --> 01:30:50.527
And there they were.
Four white horses.

01:30:50.862 --> 01:30:55.282
And I thought,
"There are four of us,
if we ever find the lady."

01:30:55.366 --> 01:30:57.367
Hello, lady.

01:30:58.327 --> 01:31:01.663
So I took them with me,
in case we ever bumped into
each other.

01:31:02.165 --> 01:31:03.957
I guess we just did.

01:31:04.041 --> 01:31:07.085
Fezzik, you did
something right.

01:31:07.170 --> 01:31:10.213
Don't worry,
I won't let it go to my head.

01:31:29.358 --> 01:31:32.986
You know,
it's very strange.

01:31:33.571 --> 01:31:35.906
I have been in
the revenge business so long,

01:31:36.574 --> 01:31:38.575
now that it's over,

01:31:38.659 --> 01:31:41.119
I don't know what to do
with the rest of my life.

01:31:42.497 --> 01:31:44.414
Have you ever
considered piracy?

01:31:44.707 --> 01:31:46.917
You'd make a wonderful
Dread Pirate Roberts.

01:31:59.305 --> 01:32:00.931
"They rode to freedom.

01:32:01.390 --> 01:32:05.435
"And as dawn arose,
Westley and Buttercup knew
they were safe.

01:32:05.603 --> 01:32:08.063
"A wave of love
swept over them,

01:32:08.231 --> 01:32:10.273
"and as they reached
for each other..."

01:32:13.236 --> 01:32:14.694
What? What?

01:32:14.779 --> 01:32:17.113
No, it's kissing again.
You don't want to hear that.

01:32:18.866 --> 01:32:20.867
I... I don't mind so much.

01:32:22.578 --> 01:32:24.246
Okay.

01:32:25.873 --> 01:32:29.417
"Since the invention
of the kiss, there have
been five kisses

01:32:29.502 --> 01:32:32.921
"that were rated
the most passionate,
the most pure.

01:32:33.005 --> 01:32:35.423
"This one left them
all behind.

01:32:40.346 --> 01:32:41.972
"The end."

01:32:44.350 --> 01:32:46.810
Now, I think
you ought to go to sleep.

01:32:47.478 --> 01:32:59.114
Okay.

01:33:00.241 --> 01:33:01.992
All right.

01:33:04.495 --> 01:33:05.996
So long.

01:33:07.957 --> 01:33:09.541
Grandpa?

01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:16.339
Maybe you could come over
and read it again
to me tomorrow.

01:33:18.342 --> 01:33:20.302
As you wish.

01:35:22.174 --> 01:35:26.428
Come my love
I'll tell you a tale

01:35:26.971 --> 01:35:31.433
Of a boy and girl
and their love story

01:35:32.435 --> 01:35:37.230
And how he loved her
Oh, so much

01:35:37.565 --> 01:35:42.152
And all the charms
she did possess

01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:47.824
Now this did happen
once upon a time

01:35:48.409 --> 01:35:52.996
When things
were not so complex

01:35:53.497 --> 01:35:58.251
And how he worshipped
the ground she walked

01:35:58.335 --> 01:36:00.754
And when he looked
in her eyes

01:36:00.838 --> 01:36:03.673
He became obsessed

01:36:04.341 --> 01:36:09.429
My love is like
a storybook story

01:36:09.513 --> 01:36:14.642
But it's as real
as the feelings I feel

01:36:14.935 --> 01:36:19.981
My love is like
a storybook story

01:36:20.357 --> 01:36:25.361
But it's as real
as the feelings I feel

01:36:25.905 --> 01:36:30.575
It's as real
as the feelings I feel

01:36:40.586 --> 01:36:46.508
He said, "Don't you know
I love you, oh, so much

01:36:47.009 --> 01:36:51.346
"And lay my heart
at the foot of your dress?"

01:36:51.430 --> 01:36:57.060
She said, "Don't you know
that storybook loves

01:36:57.853 --> 01:37:02.607
"Always have
a happy ending?"

01:37:03.275 --> 01:37:07.904
Then he swooped her up
just like in the books

01:37:08.364 --> 01:37:12.784
And on his stallion
they rode away

01:37:13.619 --> 01:37:18.581
My love is like
a storybook story

01:37:18.916 --> 01:37:23.962
But it's as real
as the feelings I feel

01:37:24.213 --> 01:37:29.551
My love is like
a storybook story

01:37:29.635 --> 01:37:34.722
But it's as real
as the feelings I feel

01:37:35.305 --> 01:37:41.410
