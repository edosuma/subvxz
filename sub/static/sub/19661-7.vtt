WEBVTT

00:11.810 --> 00:14.080
- Who would store
their stuff here?

00:14.110 --> 00:16.410
- This dump couldn't
cover my taxes.

00:16.420 --> 00:18.820
Oi! My beetles!

00:18.820 --> 00:22.450
- Sir, sir, when we're done
here, you can get your car.

00:22.460 --> 00:25.390
No car. Beetles.

00:26.730 --> 00:27.960
Fighter beetle!

00:29.700 --> 00:30.930
- Ugh.

00:30.930 --> 00:32.860
John, Paul, George
and disgusting.

00:32.870 --> 00:35.870
- You can claim your possessions
tomorrow at 10:00 A.M.

00:35.870 --> 00:39.500
The building has been seized
under civil asset forfeiture.

00:39.510 --> 00:41.740
- Sir, over here!

00:41.740 --> 00:43.640
- Watch this guy.
- Okay.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.480
- Yeah?

01:10.800 --> 01:12.440
Oh.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.780
The unit was leased
to a Nicky neele.

01:21.780 --> 01:24.550
- Sure, that sounds real.
- Yeah, as real as the address.

01:24.550 --> 01:26.720
There is no 721 broad street.

01:26.720 --> 01:29.920
And paid cash up front
for five years.

01:29.920 --> 01:32.020
- Looks like Nicky
didn't want any company.

01:32.030 --> 01:34.760
- Cause of death could have been
blunt force trauma

01:34.760 --> 01:37.230
or the slicing and dicing.

01:37.230 --> 01:40.030
- Blunt force trauma
from something like this?

01:40.030 --> 01:41.800
- I'd say that's a possible
murder weapon.

01:41.800 --> 01:44.540
Whatever did the cutting
was short but sharp.

01:44.540 --> 01:46.700
I'm thinking that box cutter.

01:46.710 --> 01:49.670
- How long was she in there?
- Given the weather,

01:49.680 --> 01:52.680
size of the maggots,

01:52.680 --> 01:54.880
eh, four or five days.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.510
I'll know more
after the autopsy.

01:56.520 --> 01:57.880
I'll send my report to pd.

01:57.880 --> 01:59.820
- We started it,
we're keeping it.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.790
- Yeah.

02:01.790 --> 02:03.550
- Hey, where's the baby?

02:05.620 --> 02:07.860
- What baby?

02:07.860 --> 02:10.630
- This lady was very pregnant.

02:12.830 --> 02:14.830
- Baby could've survived that?

02:14.830 --> 02:17.000
- Wouldn't be the first time.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.800
- If the baby was dead,

02:18.810 --> 02:20.840
the killer would have
left it here.

02:36.160 --> 02:38.690
- Cpd's checking every hospital,
urgent care,

02:38.690 --> 02:40.290
and adoption agency.
- What about suspected

02:40.290 --> 02:42.660
baby traffickers?
- It's a full court press.

02:42.660 --> 02:44.030
- Afternoon.
- Hi.

02:44.030 --> 02:46.560
- Why do we always get
the gruesome ones?

02:46.570 --> 02:48.300
- Has the me determined
a date of death yet?

02:48.300 --> 02:49.900
- Report just came back.

02:49.900 --> 02:51.300
She confirmed it
as five days ago.

02:51.300 --> 02:54.310
Apparently, maggots
are nature's stopwatch.

02:54.310 --> 02:56.010
- The woman who rented
the locker...

02:56.010 --> 02:58.140
- wait, we don't know
it's a woman.

02:58.140 --> 02:59.680
- Well, call me heteronormal,

02:59.680 --> 03:01.280
statistically,
this is a woman's crime.

03:01.280 --> 03:03.650
There were no useable prints
from the bat...

03:03.650 --> 03:05.680
Too much overlap...
But they're running DNA

03:05.690 --> 03:06.680
from the crime scene.

03:06.690 --> 03:08.550
- Did you ID the victim?

03:08.560 --> 03:10.090
- Prints weren't in the system.

03:10.090 --> 03:11.620
The killer went through her
purse, took her wallet,

03:11.620 --> 03:12.890
but missed a side pocket.

03:12.890 --> 03:14.190
That's her public transit card.

03:14.190 --> 03:15.990
- It was probably there
for easy access.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.330
She used it constantly.

03:17.330 --> 03:19.300
- Where was she going?

03:19.300 --> 03:22.700
- North clybourn,
pulaski, Hyde park, midway.

03:22.700 --> 03:25.270
Back and forth. No pattern.
- Who bought the card?

03:25.270 --> 03:27.910
- Company called
travel trainers.

03:27.910 --> 03:29.240
- Get on it.

03:31.310 --> 03:34.250
- We restore some autonomy
for people disabilities.

03:34.250 --> 03:35.950
Navigating the city's
transportation

03:35.950 --> 03:37.180
is daunting for me.

03:37.180 --> 03:38.220
Imagine what it's like
for somebody

03:38.220 --> 03:40.650
with developmental challenges.

03:40.650 --> 03:42.750
- This is Julia's card.

03:42.760 --> 03:44.590
I like Julia.

03:44.590 --> 03:46.660
- Who's Julia?
- Keys.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.160
She was one of our best aides.

03:48.160 --> 03:50.330
- Was?
- She started maternity leave

03:50.330 --> 03:54.300
last week but, um,
she was upset when she left.

03:54.300 --> 03:56.700
We only offer
the state minimum, four weeks.

03:56.700 --> 03:58.740
I get that she wanted more,
but I can't afford it.

03:58.740 --> 04:01.110
- Did you call to see
if it was a girl or a boy?

04:01.110 --> 04:03.770
- I tried. No answer.
- Husband?

04:03.780 --> 04:06.310
- Julia wasn't married.
She mentioned something about

04:06.310 --> 04:08.110
moving to Canada
where she had family,

04:08.110 --> 04:10.010
but she never came back
to pick up her things.

04:10.020 --> 04:11.220
- Mm.

04:11.220 --> 04:13.050
- Will you let us know
if she's okay?

04:13.050 --> 04:14.790
- Is it okay
to look around her desk?

04:14.790 --> 04:16.690
- Of course. That's it.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.830
- Due date's today.

04:26.100 --> 04:29.300
During my whole pregnancy,
it never really registered

04:29.300 --> 04:31.240
that in the end
I would have a baby.

04:31.240 --> 04:34.240
- Yeah, well, me and
the nightmare always thought

04:34.240 --> 04:35.710
we'd have more time
to get ready.

04:35.710 --> 04:37.680
- Every morning before work,

04:37.680 --> 04:42.180
I would go to Norma's
and order breakfast,

04:42.180 --> 04:44.120
read the paper.

04:44.120 --> 04:46.120
You know, eventually,
I'm out to here,

04:46.120 --> 04:49.720
but I still sit
at a table for one.

04:49.720 --> 04:53.660
8 1/2 months in,
it finally registers.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.730
Thing that was never gonna
happen was happening.

04:55.730 --> 04:58.100
Life was about to be...
- crazy?

04:58.100 --> 05:01.070
- Yeah. I was gonna need
a bigger table.

05:02.730 --> 05:04.240
- She was killed here.

05:04.240 --> 05:07.240
She went to yoga that morning.

05:07.240 --> 05:10.370
Looks like her routine
every Tuesday and Thursday.

05:10.380 --> 05:13.340
- There's gotta be, like,
ten yoga studios around here.

05:16.750 --> 05:20.080
- Well, not many of them
are named lotus focus.

05:26.030 --> 05:29.090
- Are you expecting?
I sense your root chakra

05:29.100 --> 05:30.760
is out of balance.

05:30.760 --> 05:33.260
- Uh, my root chakra's fine.

05:33.270 --> 05:34.870
We're here about Julia keys.

05:34.870 --> 05:37.270
- A lovely soul.
Is she okay?

05:37.270 --> 05:39.270
- When was the last time
you saw her?

05:39.270 --> 05:42.040
- Last week. Last Thursday. Why?

05:42.040 --> 05:44.810
- He kicked the entire class.

05:44.810 --> 05:46.780
- Oh, did I tell you?

05:46.780 --> 05:48.310
- She friends with any of them?

05:48.310 --> 05:49.480
- All of them.

05:49.480 --> 05:52.120
It's our oh, baby! Class.

05:52.120 --> 05:56.390
- Oh.

05:56.390 --> 05:58.220
- I'd lose my balance,
and she was, like,

05:58.220 --> 05:59.790
right there to steady me.

05:59.790 --> 06:01.860
I mean, like, literally.

06:01.860 --> 06:05.200
She was the most helpful person
I've ever met.

06:05.200 --> 06:08.330
- Did she mention anything
unusually stressful in her life?

06:08.330 --> 06:10.770
- You mean besides being
nine months pregnant

06:10.770 --> 06:12.900
and about to be a single mom?

06:12.910 --> 06:16.310
- Thanks to her jerk boyfriend.
- Ex boyfriend.

06:16.310 --> 06:18.240
- He's who you should be
talking to.

06:18.240 --> 06:19.510
Large Marge,
you guys were close.

06:19.510 --> 06:21.310
What was Julia's
boyfriend's name?

06:21.310 --> 06:23.880
- Gosh, I have no idea.

06:23.880 --> 06:26.480
- Marge, do you know...

06:26.490 --> 06:29.250
- We just call her that
'cause she's so big.

06:29.260 --> 06:32.190
She's dawn.
I'm little lentil.

06:32.190 --> 06:35.430
Baker, bun in the oven,
double bubble, pumpkin.

06:35.430 --> 06:37.500
- Brian. No, Ryan.

06:37.500 --> 06:40.900
Ryan Mathis, like Johnny.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.400
- Thank you.

06:47.770 --> 06:48.940
- Yeah?
- We're from

06:48.940 --> 06:49.940
the state's attorney's office,

06:49.940 --> 06:51.540
looking for Ryan Mathis.

06:51.540 --> 06:53.910
- Ryan?

06:57.950 --> 07:00.790
Ryan?
- Yeah? What's up?

07:00.790 --> 07:02.490
- They're from the state's
attorney's office.

07:02.490 --> 07:04.520
- What happened to your leg?

07:04.520 --> 07:07.930
- I fell off a roof.
Hazards of being a roofer.

07:07.930 --> 07:09.930
What's going on?
- What was your relationship

07:09.930 --> 07:12.230
to Julia keys?
- Mm, that's his bitch ex.

07:12.230 --> 07:13.960
- Amber!

07:13.970 --> 07:16.300
Uh, we use to go out. Why?

07:16.300 --> 07:18.400
- When's the last time
you saw her?

07:18.400 --> 07:19.970
- Six, seven months ago.

07:19.970 --> 07:22.410
She...
- dumped him.

07:22.410 --> 07:24.480
- Yeah? Why?
- Out of the blue,

07:24.480 --> 07:26.410
she stopped returning
my phone calls.

07:26.410 --> 07:29.350
I go to her place, she'd only
talk to me through the door.

07:29.350 --> 07:31.180
Said it wasn't gonna work out.

07:31.180 --> 07:33.450
- No phone calls?
What about emails? Texts?

07:33.450 --> 07:35.890
- Nothing. I mean, we had our
arguments, you know,

07:35.890 --> 07:37.490
but nothing serious.

07:37.490 --> 07:39.990
And overnight, she...

07:39.990 --> 07:41.530
I just figured
she found somebody else.

07:41.530 --> 07:43.890
- Whore.
- Will you shut up?

07:45.900 --> 07:47.360
Is she in trouble?

07:50.900 --> 07:52.870
Yeah?

07:52.870 --> 07:55.010
- DNA from
the Julia keys murder.

07:55.010 --> 07:56.910
- Tell Antonio and nagel.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.880
- J.P. In the lab
said you'd wanna know.

07:58.880 --> 08:02.450
- Why?
- There were two samples.

08:02.450 --> 08:04.280
The first was Julia keys,
obviously.

08:04.280 --> 08:07.320
The second was from someone
named David Zachariah.

08:09.920 --> 08:11.990
- That's impossible.

08:11.990 --> 08:14.290
David Zachariah
is a serial killer.

08:14.290 --> 08:16.530
He was my first
high-profile case.

08:16.530 --> 08:19.000
Eight years ago,
I put him away for life.

08:29.010 --> 08:31.340
- The victims
of David Zachariah.

08:31.340 --> 08:34.210
For ten years, young women
were going missing.

08:34.210 --> 08:36.380
He posed as Wi-Fi repair.

08:36.380 --> 08:38.320
Once inside, he drugged them
and drive them

08:38.320 --> 08:40.020
to the middle of nowhere,
kill them,

08:40.020 --> 08:43.250
have sex with the corpse
and bury it.

08:43.260 --> 08:45.220
- Oh.

08:45.220 --> 08:47.090
- Ten women in all.

08:47.090 --> 08:49.590
We couldn't find any of the
bodies until a hiker and his dog

08:49.600 --> 08:53.660
found a hand sticking out
of the ground.

08:53.670 --> 08:57.130
We matched DNA from a crease
in her ear to Zachariah.

08:57.140 --> 09:00.170
Alice white.

09:00.170 --> 09:01.940
Her dad sat in our lobby
for months

09:01.940 --> 09:04.280
while we tried to
work out a deal.

09:04.280 --> 09:06.280
- You let Zachariah plead down?

09:06.280 --> 09:08.180
- I was thinking
of the other families.

09:08.180 --> 09:10.050
Not knowing if their missing
daughters were dead or alive,

09:10.050 --> 09:12.020
it ground them down.

09:12.020 --> 09:14.650
Some of the parents held
mock funerals to help them cope.

09:14.650 --> 09:17.960
- Did it help?
- Losing a child,

09:17.960 --> 09:22.060
I doubt even
a real funeral works.

09:22.060 --> 09:25.030
Zachariah plead
to murdering Alice white.

09:25.030 --> 09:26.230
And I traded the death penalty

09:26.230 --> 09:28.630
for the location
of his other victims.

09:28.630 --> 09:31.300
And at least those families
got some kind of closure.

09:31.300 --> 09:34.610
Under the plea deal,
he got immunity for all of them.

09:34.610 --> 09:37.340
So long as he told us the truth.

09:37.340 --> 09:39.240
- So he had to have been
in the storage locker

09:39.250 --> 09:41.650
over eight years ago.

09:41.650 --> 09:46.650
- No. DNA testing back then
wasn't as accurate as it is now.

09:46.650 --> 09:49.050
The DNA in the locker has to
have come from

09:49.060 --> 09:51.720
one of Zachariah's
first degree relatives.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.620
His parents are both dead.

09:53.630 --> 09:55.660
That leaves siblings and kids.

09:55.660 --> 09:57.960
- Julia's ex?

09:57.960 --> 10:01.030
- Have Dawson and nagel
look harder into him.

10:12.280 --> 10:14.110
- I'm good.

10:14.110 --> 10:17.650
- Peter, I can't believe
you drove all the way down here.

10:17.650 --> 10:21.490
Even when phones have that
face-to-face video whatever.

10:21.490 --> 10:24.250
- I miss seeing exactly what
eight years in solitary

10:24.260 --> 10:25.990
does to a man.

10:25.990 --> 10:29.390
- Well, sometimes it does
a man good to be alone.

10:29.400 --> 10:31.260
- Especially a man like you.

10:33.500 --> 10:36.700
I notice you haven't lost
your sense of humor.

10:36.700 --> 10:40.500
- I noticed you haven't had
a visitor in over five years.

10:40.510 --> 10:43.270
- Has it been that long?

10:43.280 --> 10:46.180
What can I say?
Out of sight...

10:46.180 --> 10:50.150
- you and Randy have
a falling out?

10:50.150 --> 10:54.250
- Why on earth would you ever be
interested in my baby bro?

10:54.250 --> 10:57.150
- Just making conversation,
Zachariah.

10:58.790 --> 11:01.090
- I'm very proud of you, Peter.

11:01.090 --> 11:04.430
Deputy bureau chief at your age.

11:04.430 --> 11:08.230
I can only hope I had something
to do with your quick rise.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.200
God, I miss this.

11:14.710 --> 11:16.170
- I don't.

11:18.810 --> 11:20.480
- Randy is dead, Peter.

11:22.510 --> 11:25.080
At least that's what
they tell me.

11:33.120 --> 11:34.560
- Hey! Excuse me!

11:34.560 --> 11:36.760
- I think this time we'll talk
in our office.

11:36.760 --> 11:38.330
- Hey, hold on.
- Talk about what?

11:38.330 --> 11:40.560
- About why you lied.
- I didn't lie.

11:40.570 --> 11:42.270
- You heard of
phone records, right?

11:42.270 --> 11:44.170
You said you hadn't spoken to
Julia in six months.

11:44.170 --> 11:45.470
You had a two-minute
conversation with her

11:45.470 --> 11:47.300
the day she died.

11:47.310 --> 11:49.570
- Died? Oh, my god!
What... what happened?

11:49.580 --> 11:51.580
- No, it wasn't him.
It wasn't him.

11:51.580 --> 11:54.480
You were sleeping.
She... Julia called.

11:54.480 --> 11:57.080
I told her to leave us alone.

11:57.080 --> 11:59.350
You have to understand,
when she broke up with him,

11:59.350 --> 12:00.350
he was devastated.

12:00.350 --> 12:01.850
I've known him for years.

12:01.850 --> 12:03.090
I never saw him like that.
- What did you do?

12:03.090 --> 12:04.760
- She wanted to talk to you.

12:04.760 --> 12:07.090
I told her you'd meet her.

12:07.090 --> 12:09.490
I erased the call.
I took your phone.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.500
I met her outside
the fluff 'n fold.

12:11.500 --> 12:15.470
I told her you didn't owe her
a dime of child support.

12:15.470 --> 12:17.600
- Child support?

12:17.600 --> 12:19.570
Oh, my god.
She was pregnant?

12:19.570 --> 12:22.140
- I'm so sorry.
But what she did to you...

12:22.140 --> 12:23.570
- what else did you and Julia
talk about?

12:23.580 --> 12:25.280
- Just to leave Ryan alone.

12:25.280 --> 12:27.240
They were on their way
to pick up a crib.

12:27.250 --> 12:29.880
- They?
- Her and some other preggo.

12:29.880 --> 12:32.250
- She have a name?
- She didn't get out of the car.

12:32.250 --> 12:33.820
Probably 'cause she was huge.

12:33.820 --> 12:36.250
Even bigger than Julia.

12:36.260 --> 12:39.160
- Dawn?
Aka large Marge?

12:40.530 --> 12:42.530
- Yoga place
might have an address.

12:42.530 --> 12:44.330
- Stop. Don't touch me. Don't...
- I'm so, so sorry. Please.

12:44.330 --> 12:46.260
- Get away from me.
I can't look at you.

12:57.880 --> 12:59.540
- Hello. You're...
- Dawn, we're from

12:59.550 --> 13:01.380
the state's attorney's office.

13:01.380 --> 13:04.180
We met you at your yoga class.

13:04.180 --> 13:06.920
- Sure. Come in.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.450
- We need to talk to you
about Julia keys.

13:08.450 --> 13:11.290
It shouldn't take long.

13:21.330 --> 13:22.700
Shh.

13:26.910 --> 13:32.180
She just fell asleep.
I'll put her down.

13:32.180 --> 13:34.340
- No. I don't know.

13:42.690 --> 13:45.820
- A dead baby?
This is seriously crazy.

13:45.820 --> 13:47.390
- Every day's an adventure.

13:47.390 --> 13:48.890
- Yeah, well, end this one
quick, will you?

13:48.890 --> 13:51.700
- Dawn osborn's DNA isn't back
from the lab yet.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.630
- It's not like there's
a mystery about

13:53.630 --> 13:55.630
what happened here.

13:55.630 --> 13:57.570
- I'm not sure
how Zachariah factors in.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.900
- Oh, she's his sister.
- She's kinda young.

13:59.910 --> 14:02.640
- Then his daughter.
- Yeah, well, that's possible,

14:02.640 --> 14:04.780
but as far as I know,
he only had sex with his victims

14:04.780 --> 14:06.380
after they were dead.

14:06.380 --> 14:08.780
He said they were
less of a struggle.

14:08.780 --> 14:10.650
Theoretically, Zachariah
deserves to know

14:10.650 --> 14:11.950
about the new DNA.

14:11.950 --> 14:15.820
- Well, what he deserves
is a needle in his arm.

14:15.820 --> 14:18.490
I'll be damned
if we're handing him evidence

14:18.490 --> 14:20.460
so he can overturn
his conviction.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.730
Just move on.

14:28.400 --> 14:29.900
- I appreciate you seeing me.

14:29.900 --> 14:31.600
- What can we do for you,
Mr. Mathis?

14:31.600 --> 14:34.840
- Well, it's ironic,
Julia devoted her whole life

14:34.840 --> 14:36.540
to helping the handicapped.

14:36.540 --> 14:39.480
Now I'm the one that's
struggling on the l.

14:39.480 --> 14:40.980
- How long?
- Oh, we were together

14:40.980 --> 14:42.510
four years.

14:42.510 --> 14:44.920
Julia, she...

14:44.920 --> 14:47.620
I always thought that we would
end up back together.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.690
I had no idea
that she was pregnant.

14:49.690 --> 14:50.820
I mean, we had
talked about children,

14:50.820 --> 14:52.660
but neither of us were ready.

14:52.660 --> 14:55.560
Had I known...

14:55.560 --> 14:59.500
What kind of sick...

14:59.500 --> 15:01.630
I'm sorry, Mr. stone.

15:01.630 --> 15:02.830
- No, you're entitled.

15:07.570 --> 15:09.440
- Um...

15:09.440 --> 15:10.640
The only family that Julia
had...

15:10.640 --> 15:13.580
- Yes?
- Was an uncle in Canada.

15:13.580 --> 15:16.880
And I'm trying to make
the arrangements for her and...

15:16.880 --> 15:19.720
- What?
- My baby.

15:19.720 --> 15:22.720
And I wanted to see you,
Mr. stone,

15:22.720 --> 15:25.290
because I can't get any answers.

15:25.290 --> 15:28.590
I need to buy an outfit
for my baby to be buried in

15:28.590 --> 15:31.800
and I don't know
if it's a he or a...

15:31.800 --> 15:34.700
- she.

15:34.700 --> 15:37.730
- A little girl.

15:39.570 --> 15:40.740
- Yes?

15:40.740 --> 15:42.610
- Look, I know that
you're very busy.

15:42.610 --> 15:44.010
So i...
- Mr. Mathis,

15:44.010 --> 15:47.680
this case is why I do what I do.
- I'll let him know.

15:47.680 --> 15:48.950
- Thank you.

15:56.920 --> 15:58.320
- What was so important
that you had...

15:58.320 --> 16:00.860
- that was nagel.
DNA's back.

16:00.860 --> 16:02.530
Brace yourself.

16:02.530 --> 16:04.930
Dawn osborn
is Zachariah's daughter.

16:04.930 --> 16:06.900
- Really?

16:06.900 --> 16:08.900
It took two calls
to tell you that?

16:08.900 --> 16:10.770
- The first was from Bella.
We were served

16:10.770 --> 16:12.770
with a notice
of affirmative defense.

16:12.770 --> 16:14.840
Dawn osborn
is pleading not guilty

16:14.840 --> 16:18.110
by reason of insanity.

16:24.650 --> 16:27.620
- I was 11.

16:27.620 --> 16:30.620
They were making fun of me
for bringing my doll to camp.

16:33.520 --> 16:36.790
They grabbed her and...

16:36.800 --> 16:39.360
Ran up a trail by a high cliff

16:39.370 --> 16:41.730
and threw her off.

16:41.730 --> 16:45.800
I climbed down to get her,
but I slipped.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.740
Fell 50 feet.

16:48.740 --> 16:50.940
Banging on rocks.

16:50.940 --> 16:53.680
Trees.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.110
They ran.

16:55.110 --> 16:58.050
They didn't tell anyone.

16:58.050 --> 17:01.050
- That's terrible.

17:01.050 --> 17:04.119
- I laid there for six hours.

17:04.119 --> 17:07.859
They had to bring in
a helicopter to get me out.

17:09.390 --> 17:12.800
I broke my back, my arm,

17:12.800 --> 17:16.770
crushed my pelvis.

17:16.770 --> 17:19.770
They removed my fallopian tubes.

17:19.770 --> 17:21.940
- Oh.

17:21.940 --> 17:24.040
So you couldn't have a baby.

17:24.040 --> 17:26.680
- Didn't understand it then.

17:26.680 --> 17:30.110
- I mean...

17:30.120 --> 17:32.780
Women have babies.

17:32.790 --> 17:35.820
That's what they do.

17:35.820 --> 17:38.190
I was just like everyone else,
wasn't I?

17:38.190 --> 17:40.920
- So how long till you realized

17:40.930 --> 17:44.960
that you... you weren't
just like other women?

17:44.960 --> 17:47.000
- I was 13.

17:50.130 --> 17:52.140
There was this boy.

17:52.140 --> 17:54.100
Alex.

17:54.110 --> 17:56.870
He asked me to go
to the movies with him.

17:56.880 --> 17:58.140
I liked him.

17:58.140 --> 17:59.940
I wanted to go.

17:59.950 --> 18:05.880
But mother thought I was
too young to have a boyfriend.

18:05.880 --> 18:09.050
I cried and cried.

18:09.050 --> 18:12.090
Then daddy came into my room

18:12.090 --> 18:13.890
and told me to go with Alex,

18:13.890 --> 18:15.990
but not to tell mother.

18:15.990 --> 18:19.860
It was our little secret.

18:19.870 --> 18:22.770
- I'm just curious what
that might have to do

18:22.770 --> 18:24.970
with not being able
to have a baby.

18:27.770 --> 18:30.110
- Mother found out about Alex.

18:30.110 --> 18:34.850
When I got home,
she and daddy were fighting.

18:34.850 --> 18:40.180
I heard daddy say, "it's not
like she can get pregnant."

18:40.190 --> 18:42.790
- Hmm.

18:42.790 --> 18:45.720
And how'd you feel when you
heard your father say that?

19:03.240 --> 19:04.840
- The deposition should be on
your desk

19:04.840 --> 19:06.080
probably by the time
we're done here.

19:06.080 --> 19:09.050
- Okay, as long as...
- Mr. stone?

19:09.050 --> 19:13.080
- I'm sorry, I'm preparing...
- I'm Camille osborn.

19:13.090 --> 19:14.820
Dawn's mom.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.950
- Thank you.

19:16.960 --> 19:18.520
What can I do for you?
- You thought I'd be

19:18.520 --> 19:20.120
some kind of monster,
didn't you?

19:20.130 --> 19:21.220
- I didn't really
think about it.

19:21.230 --> 19:24.060
My neighbors, friends,

19:24.060 --> 19:26.830
people I've known for 30 years,
they avoid me.

19:26.830 --> 19:31.540
I'd probably do the same
if one of their daughters...

19:31.540 --> 19:35.240
I never thought that dawn...

19:35.240 --> 19:37.940
Could I have done something,
Mr. stone?

19:37.940 --> 19:39.980
Did I miss something?
- I'm not really

19:39.980 --> 19:43.810
in a position to...
- one night leaving work,

19:43.820 --> 19:47.280
I went into the stairwell...

19:47.290 --> 19:50.990
And he...

19:50.990 --> 19:52.560
I fought.

19:55.260 --> 19:57.790
But he was just so...

19:57.800 --> 20:01.330
- Zachariah raped you?

20:01.330 --> 20:05.170
- I never told anyone.
- Including your husband?

20:05.170 --> 20:07.570
- When I got pregnant,

20:07.570 --> 20:12.240
I let Ben think dawn was his.

20:12.240 --> 20:17.280
I'm so glad
he's not alive to see this.

20:17.280 --> 20:20.050
I don't know. I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no.

20:20.050 --> 20:22.920
Thank you.
Thank you for telling me.

20:26.290 --> 20:29.160
- A witness described a woman
who was with Julia keys

20:29.160 --> 20:32.900
on the day she was killed.
- And what did you do?

20:32.900 --> 20:34.830
- My partner and I noted
that the description

20:34.830 --> 20:37.130
matched that of dawn osborn,
who we had interviewed earlier.

20:37.140 --> 20:39.300
So we went to her residence
to question her.

20:39.300 --> 20:42.040
- When you arrived,
what did you find?

20:42.040 --> 20:44.340
- The defendant holding
the deceased child.

20:47.310 --> 20:48.910
- When you arrived
at the defendant's house,

20:48.910 --> 20:51.180
how did you announce
your presence?

20:51.180 --> 20:53.850
- We knocked and announced that
we were with the sa's office.

20:53.850 --> 20:56.020
- Did my client run?

20:56.020 --> 20:57.220
- No.
- Did she attempt

20:57.220 --> 20:59.620
to hide the child or herself?
- No.

20:59.630 --> 21:02.890
- Would you say that's typical
criminal behavior?

21:02.890 --> 21:04.630
- I'm not sure
I can answer that question.

21:04.630 --> 21:06.300
- Okay, I'll rephrase.

21:06.300 --> 21:08.060
How many times... when you've
arrested a criminal...

21:08.070 --> 21:10.930
Have they stood still,
openly displaying evidence

21:10.940 --> 21:13.400
that they've committed
a brutal crime?

21:13.410 --> 21:15.210
- None.

21:15.210 --> 21:17.340
- None. In your opinion,
would a sane person

21:17.340 --> 21:20.340
who just murdered her friend
and stolen her unborn baby

21:20.350 --> 21:22.350
greet the police
holding that baby?

21:22.350 --> 21:24.980
- Objection. It calls for
a medical opinion.

21:24.980 --> 21:26.680
- Sustained.

21:29.850 --> 21:31.820
- Criminologists
have been searching for

21:31.820 --> 21:35.090
the biological cause of
criminal behavior for centuries.

21:35.090 --> 21:38.430
For instance, recent studies
argue that certain body types

21:38.430 --> 21:40.230
were responsible
for the development

21:40.230 --> 21:42.670
of certain personality traits.

21:42.670 --> 21:44.170
- The fat kid is jolly?

21:44.170 --> 21:46.170
- That's correct.
The study concluded

21:46.170 --> 21:49.970
that the mere physical stature
of a person

21:49.980 --> 21:51.980
could determine whether
they were a criminal or not.

21:51.980 --> 21:53.940
Or whether they would
partake in criminal behavior

21:53.950 --> 21:56.110
later in life.
- That body structure

21:56.110 --> 21:58.150
is a result of what?

21:58.150 --> 22:00.880
- A person's genetic makeup.

22:00.890 --> 22:04.050
- And just like blue eyes
or big feet?

22:04.060 --> 22:06.690
- Yes.
- Approach, your honor?

22:09.990 --> 22:12.000
Counsel is arguing
the warrior gene.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.860
No court has accepted...
- cool your jets, counsel.

22:13.870 --> 22:15.900
I'm not going anywhere near
the so-called warrior gene.

22:15.900 --> 22:17.270
- You sure fooled me.

22:17.270 --> 22:19.070
- And for that I apologize.

22:19.070 --> 22:21.300
If counsel recalls,
my client claims

22:21.310 --> 22:23.410
she is not guilty
by reason of insanity.

22:23.410 --> 22:25.440
As we all know,
under the statue,

22:25.440 --> 22:29.350
that includes insanity by reason
of involuntary intoxication.

22:29.350 --> 22:31.950
- That statute is intended
for a situation in which

22:31.950 --> 22:33.950
someone drugs
another person's drink.

22:33.950 --> 22:35.150
- My client wasn't able

22:35.150 --> 22:36.250
to control her actions

22:36.250 --> 22:37.720
not because of
a bottle of bourbon

22:37.720 --> 22:39.990
but because of the stuff of life
she inherited

22:39.990 --> 22:42.360
from her father,
a serial killer.

22:42.360 --> 22:44.890
- Your honor, this is nonsense.

22:44.900 --> 22:47.360
- I tend to agree, counsel.

22:47.370 --> 22:49.130
- Then let me show you.

22:57.910 --> 23:00.210
- Do you solemnly swear that the
testimony you're about to give

23:00.210 --> 23:02.480
is the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

23:02.480 --> 23:03.780
- Yes.

23:08.190 --> 23:10.990
- Why are you currently
incarcerated, Mr. Zachariah?

23:10.990 --> 23:13.490
- They said I killed a woman
named Alice white.

23:13.490 --> 23:15.960
- Did you?
- I told them I did.

23:15.960 --> 23:17.360
- What else did you tell them?

23:17.360 --> 23:21.060
- That I killed
nine other women.

23:21.070 --> 23:25.070
- Did you?
- Yes.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.970
But not Alice.

23:26.970 --> 23:28.470
- Did you hate those women?

23:28.470 --> 23:31.940
- I didn't know them.
They let me in their houses

23:31.940 --> 23:34.540
to fix their Wi-Fi, that's it.

23:34.550 --> 23:36.110
- Let's talk about that.

23:36.110 --> 23:37.510
When you woke up in the morning,

23:37.520 --> 23:39.480
did you look in the mirror
and say,

23:39.480 --> 23:41.990
"today I'm going
to kill someone"?

23:41.990 --> 23:44.090
- No.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.360
It kinda grew over time.

23:46.360 --> 23:49.030
Like a wave.

23:49.030 --> 23:52.300
The feeling would start small.

23:52.300 --> 23:54.500
I'd see a woman's ankle.

23:54.500 --> 23:58.000
The way her fingertip would
touch an elevator button.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.500
How she'd put her hair
behind her ear.

24:00.510 --> 24:05.110
And all that time,
the wave would get bigger.

24:05.110 --> 24:07.110
The tow stronger.

24:07.110 --> 24:11.280
- She's studying him.
- Dragging me out to sea.

24:11.280 --> 24:13.380
- And then you'd
kill your victim.

24:13.390 --> 24:16.520
- I had no choice.
It would get worse and worse

24:16.520 --> 24:22.260
until I didn't wanna drown,
you know?

24:22.260 --> 24:24.530
- When did this feeling stop?

24:24.530 --> 24:27.130
- When I saw the veins
swelling in her forehead

24:27.130 --> 24:28.830
when I squeezed her neck.

24:33.100 --> 24:35.270
- Thank you.

24:38.280 --> 24:41.380
Torrent downloaded from RARBG

24:48.850 --> 24:51.860
- how many people have you
killed in prison, sir?

24:51.860 --> 24:54.590
- None.

24:54.590 --> 24:57.430
- So the urge went away.

24:57.430 --> 25:00.260
- There aren't any women there.

25:00.270 --> 25:03.130
- But this urge...
This wave growing

25:03.130 --> 25:04.400
and pulling you out to sea...

25:04.400 --> 25:06.170
Killing a man
wouldn't satisfy it?

25:06.170 --> 25:09.540
- No, it wouldn't.

25:09.540 --> 25:12.140
- But you didn't drown, did you?

25:12.140 --> 25:15.480
Somehow you controlled
this uncontrollable urge.

25:15.480 --> 25:17.550
How did you do that,
Mr. Zachariah?

25:17.550 --> 25:19.450
- I just did.

25:19.450 --> 25:21.580
- How many people
did your mother kill?

25:21.590 --> 25:24.890
- None, as far as I know.

25:24.890 --> 25:26.360
- How about your father?

25:26.360 --> 25:29.230
- People? None.

25:29.230 --> 25:31.590
But he killed plenty of animals.

25:31.600 --> 25:34.060
He worked at a slaughterhouse.

25:34.070 --> 25:36.330
Same as his father.

25:36.330 --> 25:37.600
- Because your
father killed cows,

25:37.600 --> 25:41.140
you were destined to kill women.

25:41.140 --> 25:43.470
- It's not that absurd,
Mr. stone.

25:43.480 --> 25:45.410
Your first career
wasn't in the courtroom,

25:45.410 --> 25:49.080
if I can believe Google.

25:49.080 --> 25:50.650
But look where you ended up.

25:50.650 --> 25:55.490
Smack in your father's shoes.

25:55.490 --> 25:58.250
- It was my choice, sir.

26:18.940 --> 26:22.150
- You mind?
- Please.

26:22.150 --> 26:23.550
- Hey.
- Hi.

26:23.550 --> 26:25.520
- You know, you missed
happy hour

26:25.520 --> 26:27.720
by, like, five hours.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.690
That was intentional.

26:29.690 --> 26:32.690
- Ah, I'm with you on that.
What's to be happy about?

26:32.690 --> 26:35.490
Except, of course,
half price drinks.

26:40.030 --> 26:44.030
- My old man was a drunk.

26:44.040 --> 26:47.700
Mm, once when I was 12, I, uh,

26:47.710 --> 26:49.170
found him after a bender.

26:49.170 --> 26:52.740
Puke on his shoes
and piss on his pants.

26:52.740 --> 26:55.510
He was one tough bastard.

26:55.510 --> 26:58.050
When he saw me, he just cried.

26:58.050 --> 27:01.180
Told me to look the other way.

27:01.190 --> 27:04.290
- He didn't want
his little girl to know.

27:04.290 --> 27:07.220
- Yeah, well, next time I found
him, it was in the driveway.

27:07.230 --> 27:09.060
He couldn't even make it
into the house.

27:09.060 --> 27:11.530
Or he thought
he was already in bed.

27:11.530 --> 27:14.560
I'm not really sure.

27:14.570 --> 27:16.600
I pick him up
and we start walking inside

27:16.600 --> 27:19.600
and I ask him why.

27:19.600 --> 27:22.170
He said, "ladybug..."

27:22.170 --> 27:24.270
don't you ever call me that,
by the way.

27:27.640 --> 27:33.220
"It's just the way it is.
I can't stop."

27:33.220 --> 27:36.090
- We all make choices, Laura.

27:36.090 --> 27:38.050
- Yeah, well, for me it was like

27:38.060 --> 27:39.560
I was in the middle
of lake Michigan

27:39.560 --> 27:42.330
in a row boat
that sprung a leak.

27:42.330 --> 27:44.130
Sure, I got it plugged in time.

27:44.130 --> 27:47.200
Who knows? Maybe there is
something to genetics.

27:51.100 --> 27:54.140
- Your DNA didn't
buy those pills.

27:54.140 --> 27:57.110
Your DNA didn't make you
swallow them.

27:57.110 --> 27:59.240
- All I'm saying is,
if he wasn't my father,

27:59.240 --> 28:02.150
maybe Dawson's not
the chief investigator.

28:02.150 --> 28:05.650
Maybe I'm calling the shots now.

28:05.650 --> 28:08.120
Maybe I get to rush home

28:08.120 --> 28:11.390
to take care of my kid
after work.

28:23.230 --> 28:27.200
- It's like an electric storm
in my head.

28:27.210 --> 28:30.740
Everything feels close.
My head buzzes.

28:30.740 --> 28:33.110
I can't pin anything down.

28:33.110 --> 28:35.340
- Did you feel that electric
storm at yoga class

28:35.350 --> 28:37.850
when you asked Julia keys
if she wanted to look

28:37.850 --> 28:39.680
at your extra crib?

28:39.680 --> 28:41.720
- It was just a little tingling.

28:41.720 --> 28:46.290
- So you didn't know you were
gonna kill her at class?

28:46.290 --> 28:48.260
- No.

28:48.260 --> 28:50.260
- How about when you were
in the car with Julia?

28:50.260 --> 28:52.600
- The tingling was
getting stronger.

28:52.600 --> 28:56.370
It was like a beating
in the front of my head.

28:56.370 --> 29:00.140
This pulsing and pulsing.

29:00.140 --> 29:03.710
I knew the only way
to make it go away was...

29:03.710 --> 29:05.240
- what, dawn?

29:07.210 --> 29:08.680
- Was to kill her.

29:10.410 --> 29:14.180
- So what did you do, then?

29:14.190 --> 29:16.820
- When we were in the locker,

29:16.820 --> 29:19.120
I picked up a baseball bat
and I hit her

29:19.120 --> 29:22.290
in the back of the head
as hard as I could.

29:22.290 --> 29:23.790
- Did the storm go away?

29:26.600 --> 29:28.200
- No.

29:30.900 --> 29:33.740
- What did you do, then?

29:33.740 --> 29:34.840
- I...

29:37.270 --> 29:40.740
I knew there was
a baby inside her.

29:40.750 --> 29:44.350
I thought if I could just
kill one more person...

29:44.350 --> 29:48.220
So I cut the baby out of her
and killed it.

29:55.360 --> 29:57.460
- Nothing further.

30:04.330 --> 30:07.800
- So you're a born killer.

30:07.810 --> 30:10.440
- That's what Dr. Lyle says.

30:12.810 --> 30:15.240
- And yet,
this is the first time

30:15.250 --> 30:17.780
you've killed anyone.

30:17.780 --> 30:19.780
- Hm.

30:19.780 --> 30:22.650
No.

30:22.650 --> 30:24.790
- No?

30:24.790 --> 30:27.190
- No, it's not.

30:32.300 --> 30:35.500
- Who else have you murdered?

30:35.500 --> 30:38.940
- When I was 26 years old,

30:38.940 --> 30:41.840
I killed a woman.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.710
- What woman?

30:46.280 --> 30:49.510
Alice white.

30:49.510 --> 30:54.250
- The woman your biological
father confessed to murdering.

30:54.250 --> 30:56.220
- He only said he killed her.

30:59.990 --> 31:02.290
To protect me.

31:04.860 --> 31:06.430
- I'm gonna call a recess

31:06.430 --> 31:07.960
for the witness
to gather herself.

31:07.970 --> 31:11.270
We can pick up here tomorrow,
Mr. stone.

31:11.270 --> 31:13.400
Court's adjourned.

31:15.310 --> 31:16.870
- She's obviously lying.

31:16.870 --> 31:19.340
- Or Matthews and Dr. Lyle
convinced her it's all true.

31:19.340 --> 31:23.310
- Maybe it is.
- You're kidding.

31:23.310 --> 31:24.910
With all due respect.

31:24.920 --> 31:27.320
- Tell me something,
Ms. valdez.

31:27.320 --> 31:29.990
If I told you that all this
global warming stuff

31:29.990 --> 31:33.420
was a bunch of crap,
what would you tell me?

31:33.420 --> 31:35.290
- I'd tell you
you were mistaken.

31:35.290 --> 31:38.730
- No. You'd call me
a flat-earther.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.960
Genetics has been
an indisputable science

31:40.970 --> 31:44.000
a lot longer
than climate change.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.470
- You don't think
that dawn osborn

31:45.470 --> 31:48.040
was genetically predisposed
to murder.

31:48.040 --> 31:50.470
- They're designing babies,
for crying out loud.

31:50.480 --> 31:55.410
Blonde, six foot, male,
great at hitting a fastball.

31:55.410 --> 31:58.010
Why not a five foot
two inch killer?

31:58.020 --> 31:59.950
- I'm sure dawn lied about
killing Alice white

31:59.950 --> 32:02.890
as some misplaced way
to help Zachariah.

32:02.890 --> 32:05.890
- She didn't even know him
before this trial.

32:05.890 --> 32:07.590
- Mm.

32:07.590 --> 32:09.290
Prove it.

32:16.500 --> 32:18.700
- "Jessica's jubilee."

32:18.700 --> 32:20.540
I can't believe
they're still publishing it.

32:20.540 --> 32:22.370
When Jen was three,
she was obsessed with it.

32:22.370 --> 32:24.910
She begged us
to adopt an elephant.

32:30.510 --> 32:33.750
So do you think my kid's
destined to be a pill popper?

32:33.750 --> 32:38.750
- Sure, if she gets shot at
while catching bad guys.

32:38.760 --> 32:40.520
- Thanks.

32:40.530 --> 32:41.860
So we've been
through the house twice,

32:41.860 --> 32:43.530
there's nothing here that
connects dawn

32:43.530 --> 32:45.700
with her loving father
or Alice white.

32:45.700 --> 32:48.330
- Or even says she knew him.
- Yeah.

32:51.870 --> 32:53.570
Nagel.

32:55.470 --> 32:57.810
Thursday. 4:00.

32:57.810 --> 33:01.440
Thanks, I'll be there.

33:01.450 --> 33:03.610
- This may be something.

33:05.580 --> 33:06.680
- Hm.

33:09.350 --> 33:11.550
- I'm gonna show you this book,
Ms. osborn.

33:11.560 --> 33:13.690
It's called
"pregnancy procedures."

33:13.690 --> 33:15.860
Have you seen it before?

33:15.860 --> 33:17.560
- I don't know.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.830
- Allow me to refresh
your recollection.

33:19.830 --> 33:22.570
Please turn to page 369,
if you don't mind.

33:22.570 --> 33:25.700
I marked it with a red tab.

33:25.700 --> 33:27.840
What is the title
of that chapter?

33:27.840 --> 33:29.610
- "Cesarean sections."

33:29.610 --> 33:30.740
- Do you recognize
the handwriting

33:30.740 --> 33:33.540
in the margins on that page?

33:33.540 --> 33:34.910
Please turn the page.

33:38.580 --> 33:41.380
What about the handwriting
on that page?

33:41.390 --> 33:42.690
This is your book, dawn.

33:45.620 --> 33:48.490
You bought it

33:48.490 --> 33:51.430
and you studied it
to perform a c-section on Julia.

33:51.430 --> 33:55.130
But something went wrong.

33:55.130 --> 33:57.430
And there you were,

33:57.440 --> 34:01.000
holding the one thing you
wanted more than anything else.

34:06.140 --> 34:08.909
- I killed the baby.

34:08.909 --> 34:11.909
- Yes, you did.

34:13.880 --> 34:15.750
Are you aware
that the medical examiner

34:15.750 --> 34:19.520
found that Ms. keys' baby
had cracked ribs?

34:22.630 --> 34:24.690
Or had contusions on her chest?

34:24.699 --> 34:27.199
- If that's what he said.

34:27.199 --> 34:29.530
- Does it surprise you?

34:31.699 --> 34:34.969
- I had an uncontrollable urge.
- Perhaps.

34:36.710 --> 34:40.210
But not to kill the baby.

34:40.210 --> 34:43.210
You gave the baby cpr,
didn't you?

34:43.210 --> 34:45.480
That's why her ribs
were cracked.

34:45.480 --> 34:47.750
That's why she had
a contusion on her chest.

34:49.650 --> 34:50.989
You didn't try
to kill the baby, dawn.

34:50.989 --> 34:54.790
You tried to save her.

34:54.790 --> 34:59.660
- One time, I was downtown
to see a play.

34:59.660 --> 35:02.500
I got there early,
so I walked around,

35:02.500 --> 35:04.470
looking at store windows.

35:06.670 --> 35:11.940
This filthy woman...
Sure, she was homeless...

35:11.940 --> 35:14.940
She asked me for money.

35:14.950 --> 35:19.010
I gave her a dollar,
but she wanted more.

35:19.020 --> 35:22.250
And then she pointed
to the corner.

35:22.250 --> 35:27.760
A finger that hadn't been
washed in months.

35:27.760 --> 35:31.560
And then I saw them.

35:31.560 --> 35:36.570
Four filthy kids.

35:36.570 --> 35:40.240
Skinny like toothpicks.

35:40.240 --> 35:42.940
She said she needed
to buy them food.

35:46.640 --> 35:49.550
Now, how can this homeless hag

35:49.550 --> 35:52.680
have four children

35:52.680 --> 35:54.980
and I can't have one?

36:33.890 --> 36:35.890
- publish the verdict,
Ms. Decker.

36:39.130 --> 36:41.830
- "In the matter of the people
of the state of Illinois

36:41.830 --> 36:45.770
"versus dawn osborn,
the jury finds the defendant

36:45.770 --> 36:49.000
"on the first count, murder in
the first degree of Julia keys,

36:49.010 --> 36:52.110
"guilty.

36:52.110 --> 36:54.640
"On the second count,
murder in the first degree

36:54.650 --> 36:57.650
of baby girl keys, guilty."

37:05.060 --> 37:08.820
- The people thank the jury for
their verdict and their service.

37:08.830 --> 37:10.830
This court is now adjourned.

37:13.800 --> 37:16.070
- After Matthews' summation,
I never expected this.

37:16.070 --> 37:18.070
- We got lucky with the jury.
A bunch of flat-earthers.

37:18.070 --> 37:20.770
- Peter stone?
- Yeah.

37:20.770 --> 37:22.000
Thanks.

37:24.340 --> 37:26.780
Zachariah filed for
post-conviction,

37:26.780 --> 37:28.080
based on newly discovered
evidence,

37:28.080 --> 37:30.810
the confession under oath
of his daughter.

37:30.820 --> 37:32.620
And if he wins...
- you gave him immunity

37:32.620 --> 37:34.920
on the nine other murders.

37:34.920 --> 37:36.690
This bastard might walk.

37:38.820 --> 37:41.090
- Mr. Zachariah.

37:41.090 --> 37:43.190
- Yes, judge.
The petitioner is offering

37:43.190 --> 37:47.000
newly discovered evidence
that warrants the conviction

37:47.000 --> 37:49.370
in his murder case
be overturned.

37:49.370 --> 37:51.370
- What kind of evidence?

37:51.370 --> 37:53.000
- Testimonial.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.140
- Go ahead.
- Well, as you know,

37:55.140 --> 37:57.970
the petitioner was charged
and convicted

37:57.980 --> 38:00.840
in the killing of one,
Alice white.

38:00.850 --> 38:05.410
While it appears that a recently
convicted murderer...

38:05.420 --> 38:08.880
That is, dawn osborn...
Swore under oath

38:08.890 --> 38:12.820
that it was in fact she... her.

38:12.820 --> 38:16.760
Anyway, Ms. osborn confessed
to killing Mrs. white.

38:17.960 --> 38:20.130
- Any response, Mr. stone?

38:22.700 --> 38:24.800
- No, judge.

38:28.740 --> 38:31.710
Actually, there is, uh...

38:31.710 --> 38:32.980
There's one thing, your honor.

38:35.780 --> 38:37.410
The terms of Mr. Zachariah's
plea deal

38:37.420 --> 38:39.680
in the Alice white murder

38:39.680 --> 38:42.450
require complete honesty
on his part.

38:42.450 --> 38:44.820
Mr. Zachariah recently
stated under oath

38:44.820 --> 38:46.820
that he did not
kill Alice white.

38:46.820 --> 38:49.160
Meaning, if he did not kill her,

38:49.160 --> 38:51.160
he lied in his original plea.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.930
Dishonesty voids the plea.

38:55.930 --> 38:58.170
Consequently,
immunity in his nine murders

38:58.170 --> 39:01.170
is null and void.

39:01.170 --> 39:04.740
We have six hours of recording
in which Mr. Zachariah

39:04.740 --> 39:06.210
reveals the details
of the nine murders

39:06.210 --> 39:09.910
that could only be known
by the killer.

39:09.910 --> 39:11.980
He drew maps,
detailing locations of bodies

39:11.980 --> 39:15.150
in deeply wooded areas across
Illinois and Indiana.

39:15.150 --> 39:17.820
And then there's
the sworn testimony

39:17.820 --> 39:19.760
from Ms. osborn's trial

39:19.760 --> 39:22.960
in which he admitted killing
all nine women.

39:27.060 --> 39:29.230
Which should be helpful
to the state of Indiana

39:29.230 --> 39:34.300
as they begin their prosecution
of Mr. Zachariah.

39:34.310 --> 39:37.210
- Why are you sending
this case to Indiana?

39:37.210 --> 39:38.270
- That's where four
of the victims

39:38.280 --> 39:41.080
were discovered, your honor.

39:41.080 --> 39:44.010
And Indiana
has the death penalty.

39:50.950 --> 39:54.090
- Mr. Zachariah,
you are remanded to prison,

39:54.090 --> 39:57.960
pending extradition to Indiana.

40:14.810 --> 40:16.550
- You've been going to na.
That's good.

40:16.550 --> 40:18.250
- Mm.

40:18.250 --> 40:21.150
- You missed a home visit
from a court evaluator?

40:21.150 --> 40:23.890
- I had an emergency at work.

40:25.560 --> 40:27.320
- Twice?

40:29.990 --> 40:33.860
If the judge grants you
shared custody and it's your day

40:33.860 --> 40:35.960
to pick up your daughter
from school,

40:35.970 --> 40:40.140
what will happen if you have
another work emergency?

40:40.140 --> 40:42.100
- Well, i... i would
arrange for her

40:42.110 --> 40:44.270
to be picked up by someone else.

40:49.180 --> 40:52.150
Please. This is my daughter.

40:52.150 --> 40:54.250
I will pee in a cup.
I will do whatever it takes.

40:54.250 --> 40:57.250
- My only concern, Ms. nagel,
is the welfare of your child

40:57.250 --> 41:01.590
and the environment
she'd be returning to.

41:01.590 --> 41:03.890
- I was never addicted,
you know?

41:03.890 --> 41:06.060
I was shot. The hospital
gave me painkillers.

41:06.060 --> 41:08.560
I took them.
- Your husband...

41:08.570 --> 41:11.330
- made a big deal of it
to get sole custody.

41:11.340 --> 41:13.240
It was over in a few months.

41:17.240 --> 41:21.280
- I'm sorry.
The record is the record.

41:21.280 --> 41:24.050
At this time,
I can't recommend that the judge.

41:24.050 --> 41:26.280
Grant you shared custody
with all the instability

41:26.280 --> 41:27.320
in your life.
