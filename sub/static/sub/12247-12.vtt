WEBVTT

00:03.379 --> 00:04.762
Looks like a seahorse.

00:04.768 --> 00:07.350
Hey, did you know that
seahorses like to swim in pairs?

00:07.356 --> 00:09.337
They link tails so they
don't lose each other.

00:10.455 --> 00:11.655
Fuck it, I'll do it.

00:11.661 --> 00:14.051
We take Bea down, I'll take on top dog.

00:14.057 --> 00:15.835
Come on, it's just an old school eccy.

00:16.332 --> 00:17.961
- Yes!
- Whoo!

00:18.912 --> 00:20.112
Thank you.

00:20.118 --> 00:22.212
- It's all there, ten large.
- Huh...

00:22.218 --> 00:25.328
I want the other 90 grand in my
account by 4:00 PM this afternoon.

00:25.334 --> 00:26.534
I'll do it.

00:27.039 --> 00:29.434
- Governor.
- Slot Mercado.

00:30.288 --> 00:31.488
Argh!

00:31.494 --> 00:34.486
I want that money in my bank
account, by midday tomorrow afternoon,

00:34.492 --> 00:36.350
or next time, this'll be fucking loaded!

00:36.356 --> 00:37.619
They're gonna kill me.

00:37.625 --> 00:39.345
Well, if it's just about money...

00:39.351 --> 00:41.130
that's something I've got plenty of.

00:41.136 --> 00:42.571
What do I have to do for it?

00:42.577 --> 00:44.510
It was me. I lagged.

00:44.516 --> 00:47.628
Well, you can't be top dog and
a lagger. It's one or the other.

00:47.997 --> 00:49.197
I'm done.

Attention, compound.

Count will commence in 10 minutes.

02:06.532 --> 02:07.732
Bea.

02:09.408 --> 02:11.089
You look like a teenager.

02:12.854 --> 02:15.581
- Allie here?
- She's gone to the showers.

02:15.587 --> 02:18.712
If you're gonna follow her,
love, you watch your back, yeah?

02:18.969 --> 02:20.889
- I'll be all right.
- Mmm.

02:31.825 --> 02:33.154
Allie?

02:43.122 --> 02:45.269
Allie? Allie?!

02:45.746 --> 02:48.262
Wake up. Please wake up!

02:49.200 --> 02:50.403
Shit!

02:53.237 --> 02:55.502
Allie, you're gonna be
okay. You just hang in there.

02:55.508 --> 02:56.336
- Out of the way!
- Get out of the way. Out of

02:56.342 --> 02:58.159
- the way, out of the way.
- Okay? Hey.

02:59.125 --> 03:00.329
No-no.

03:00.334 --> 03:03.523
- No. Come on, let us handle it, okay.
- No, no, no. I-I-I'm not leaving her.

03:03.529 --> 03:04.937
- What happened?
- It's an overdose.

03:04.943 --> 03:06.272
- What? No, she didn't OD. No-no...
- Sierra 1 this is

03:06.277 --> 03:07.817
- she... she's not using anymore.
- Sierra 2. Call an ambulance,

03:07.822 --> 03:09.844
- we've got a Code Black.
- She's not breathing. We need to resus.

03:09.849 --> 03:11.491
- Allie!
- Get Smith back to the unit.

03:11.497 --> 03:13.036
- Come on.
- No, no, no.

03:13.042 --> 03:14.396
- You're not listening to me.
- She's okay.

03:14.401 --> 03:16.666
You're not listening to me. She wouldn't
have done this. She's clean now.

03:16.671 --> 03:18.002
She's clean!

03:18.972 --> 03:21.091
- This is my fault. I said this
- No.

03:21.097 --> 03:22.778
- would happen. I fucking knew it.
- No,

03:22.784 --> 03:24.918
- Bea, you've got to calm down, love.
- No, I warned her.

03:24.923 --> 03:27.792
- I said that we shouldn't get involved.
- Bea. Bea. Bea...

03:27.798 --> 03:29.575
But why would someone hotshot her?

03:29.838 --> 03:31.083
To get back at me?

03:31.089 --> 03:33.837
See, it could've been Tina, you
know, 'cause you lagged on her.

03:34.008 --> 03:37.736
But... but, no, it weren't her, 'cause
I seen her in the Visitors Centre so...

03:41.369 --> 03:44.281
Then it... then it's
Kaz. It's gotta be Kaz.

03:45.976 --> 03:49.385
- I can't lose her.
- Oh, Bea.

03:50.969 --> 03:53.731
There's six minutes of footage missing.

03:53.737 --> 03:55.033
Probably a hard drive crash.

03:55.039 --> 03:56.563
That's too convenient.

03:56.836 --> 03:59.142
Nup. Someone's wiped it.

03:59.734 --> 04:01.482
Which means an officer's involved.

04:01.488 --> 04:02.982
You think an officer hurt Novak?

04:02.988 --> 04:05.198
No, but they might
have sold her the drugs.

04:07.849 --> 04:11.485
Excuse me, Governor. Mr Jackson's
gone with Novak in the ambulance.

04:11.927 --> 04:14.435
- How is she?
- Critical.

04:18.238 --> 04:19.728
Is everything all right?

04:19.735 --> 04:21.442
Yeah. Keep me informed.

04:26.009 --> 04:27.852
Call in the CSDS.

04:27.961 --> 04:31.271
I want every officer
searched and drug tested.

04:32.449 --> 04:34.287
Did you hear what happened with Allie?

04:35.360 --> 04:37.255
Love, what's wrong?

04:40.122 --> 04:43.551
Hey, Sonia...

04:43.557 --> 04:44.803
what's happened?

04:45.118 --> 04:49.026
The police came to interview
me. They've found Helen's body.

04:49.032 --> 04:50.697
Oh, Jesus.

04:51.132 --> 04:52.338
Where?

04:52.344 --> 04:55.426
Uh, somewhere in the hills.

04:55.432 --> 04:57.018
I still thought she
was out there somewhere.

04:57.023 --> 04:58.758
She was okay. I can't believe it.

04:59.182 --> 05:01.189
And the cops still think you did it.

05:01.783 --> 05:04.256
I thought she'd just come
back and they'd realise

05:04.262 --> 05:06.182
it was a terrible mistake.

05:06.188 --> 05:09.126
Well, don't worry about the cops,
'cause if they haven't got any evidence,

05:09.132 --> 05:11.664
- their case will just fall apart, love.
- No, you don't know them.

05:11.669 --> 05:13.305
They'll do anything to get conviction.

05:14.517 --> 05:16.573
- Those poor children.
- Mm.

05:16.579 --> 05:18.688
Oh, they'll be devastated.

05:23.656 --> 05:27.844
I just can't stop picturing
her, lying there all alone,

05:28.250 --> 05:31.149
- just rotting.
- No, no, no. Now, listen. Listen.

05:31.369 --> 05:34.656
You can't think of her like that. Okay?

05:34.662 --> 05:37.578
You have to try and remember
her how she was. Yeah?

05:37.584 --> 05:39.649
She was such a beautiful person.

05:41.699 --> 05:43.733
She didn't deserve this.

05:44.086 --> 05:45.723
I'm so sorry.

05:49.231 --> 05:50.432
- Attention, compound.
- Oh, darling.

05:50.437 --> 05:52.281
Attention, compound. All women...

05:52.287 --> 05:54.812
Let it out, love. It's
all right. Let it out.

05:57.510 --> 05:59.271
- Fucking lagger.
- Dog.

05:59.277 --> 06:00.841
Woof, woof, woof, woof,
woof, woof, woof, woof, woof!

06:00.846 --> 06:02.206
Mr Jackson!

06:02.635 --> 06:04.112
How's Allie?

06:04.409 --> 06:06.254
She's, uh, critical, but stable.

06:06.260 --> 06:08.544
I-I-I... I need to
see the Governor. I...

06:09.050 --> 06:10.640
I... I want to go to the hospital.

06:10.646 --> 06:12.284
Bea, you know that's not gonna happen.

06:13.355 --> 06:14.555
Yeah.

06:17.555 --> 06:19.860
So, it's true. You guys together?

06:22.352 --> 06:25.197
I swear to you, she
wouldn't do this to herself.

06:26.540 --> 06:30.408
Can you check the CCTV and get
the governor to check the CCTV?

06:30.414 --> 06:32.461
- We have.
- And?

06:33.589 --> 06:34.807
Nothing.

06:34.867 --> 06:37.188
- W-what... Really? What does that mean?
- Look, look. Just

06:37.194 --> 06:39.108
stay calm, okay? We'll figure it out.

06:51.088 --> 06:52.728
That's all I can tell you.

07:06.044 --> 07:07.556
Your clothes...

07:07.935 --> 07:09.569
for the trial tomorrow.

07:09.575 --> 07:11.342
Well, clearly you have
something else to say,

07:11.348 --> 07:12.907
or you wouldn't have
delivered them yourself.

07:12.912 --> 07:16.263
I'm just looking forward
to seeing justice prevail.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.469
Hmm.

07:18.082 --> 07:19.474
How's Novak?

07:20.379 --> 07:24.013
Saw that little commotion
in the corridor earlier.

07:24.177 --> 07:26.989
Very, very messy.

07:26.995 --> 07:29.961
- She's in hospital.
- Once an addict, always an addict.

07:29.967 --> 07:33.072
Still, doesn't look very good
for your statistics, does it?

07:33.461 --> 07:35.054
I'll whip things into shape,

07:35.060 --> 07:37.180
once I'm back in the governor's chair.

07:37.186 --> 07:39.785
That is never going to happen.

07:39.791 --> 07:41.491
You're right about one thing, Vera.

07:41.783 --> 07:43.797
Justice will prevail.

07:56.361 --> 07:58.620
Argh! Oh! Argh!

07:58.626 --> 07:59.893
Uh!

07:59.899 --> 08:01.655
Oh! Fuck!

08:01.661 --> 08:03.207
- Oh!
- Argh!

08:03.213 --> 08:06.326
Get the fuck off! Get the fuck off!

08:06.949 --> 08:08.152
Fuck!

08:08.792 --> 08:11.722
Fuck you! Get the fuck off me!

08:12.136 --> 08:14.496
Argh! Argh!

08:17.166 --> 08:18.687
No! Oh!

08:23.141 --> 08:25.229
Oh, what the fuck?

08:32.874 --> 08:34.304
What the fuck?!

08:34.407 --> 08:37.042
- You got a screw to help you, yeah?
- What?!

08:37.048 --> 08:38.950
I saw you talking to Smiles.

08:38.956 --> 08:41.712
I was fucking asking about Allie.

08:41.717 --> 08:43.229
You tried to kill Allie!

08:43.390 --> 08:44.908
You don't want us to be together.

08:44.914 --> 08:46.682
You couldn't handle us being happy.

08:46.867 --> 08:51.441
You are fucking insane.
I never touched her.

08:54.492 --> 08:56.068
Fuck.

08:58.797 --> 09:00.187
I love her, too.

09:19.537 --> 09:20.849
How's Allie?

09:20.855 --> 09:23.537
I'll let you know as soon as we've
got news. What happened to you?

09:23.543 --> 09:26.436
It was Proctor. I just treated
her. She's gone back to her unit.

09:27.638 --> 09:29.170
Was this about Novak?

09:29.176 --> 09:31.075
Did you find out who did that to Allie?

09:31.081 --> 09:32.688
We're investigating the overdose.

09:32.694 --> 09:34.885
She was given a hotshot. She
didn't do that to herself.

09:34.891 --> 09:36.285
How do you know that?

09:37.543 --> 09:39.729
She promised me and...
and I believe her.

09:39.735 --> 09:41.221
She'll need to stay
in Medical overnight.

09:41.226 --> 09:42.637
There's a possible concussion.

09:42.643 --> 09:45.908
Oh, fuck! She didn't OD.

09:46.347 --> 09:48.265
Someone did this to her.

09:48.271 --> 09:50.886
I'm doing everything I
can and so are the doctors.

10:57.410 --> 10:59.622
And today, the trial of former Wentworth

10:59.627 --> 11:01.561
Correctional Centre Governor begins.

11:01.567 --> 11:04.904
Joan Ferguson stands accused
of a host of serious charges.

11:04.910 --> 11:07.435
Her trial is expected
to last several weeks

11:07.441 --> 11:10.195
and will be an embarrassment
to the correctional department.

11:14.047 --> 11:16.035
Thanks. You can just wait out there.

11:21.620 --> 11:22.886
What's happened?

11:23.417 --> 11:27.489
I think whoever wiped that CCTV was
protecting a drug deal with Novak.

11:27.495 --> 11:29.252
We're testing and
searching all the staff.

11:29.258 --> 11:31.367
Once you've submitted your
test, you can take over.

11:31.467 --> 11:33.627
But... I'm Deputy.

11:33.633 --> 11:35.771
Mm, I'm Governor, and I'm doing it.

11:36.567 --> 11:37.695
They found anything?

11:37.701 --> 11:39.272
Ms Miles' locker's clean.

11:41.565 --> 11:45.149
Oh, all right. Keep me informed.
Mr Jackson'll be in charge.

11:48.276 --> 11:49.785
They're doing urine tests.

11:49.791 --> 11:51.888
What about the other night? That
shit will still be in our systems.

11:51.893 --> 11:53.409
- We'll be fine by now.
- Well,

11:53.414 --> 11:54.777
if it's not, we're fucked!

11:57.072 --> 12:00.206
I'll sweet talk Radcliffe.
Get her to lose our samples.

12:00.212 --> 12:01.784
She's desperate for a piece of me.

12:05.682 --> 12:07.393
See? Don't worry about it.

12:08.705 --> 12:09.905
You're up.

12:13.426 --> 12:16.546
Hey. Um, I need a favour.

12:16.552 --> 12:18.312
I've had a couple of
big nights lately and,

12:18.318 --> 12:20.176
uh, just wanna keep it on the DL.

12:20.182 --> 12:22.062
Was hoping you could
maybe lose my sample.

12:22.583 --> 12:23.988
Why would I do that?

12:23.994 --> 12:26.154
Because I'd be very grateful.

12:45.306 --> 12:47.414
I have a good feeling about today.

13:06.542 --> 13:08.595
My condolences about Allie.

13:10.188 --> 13:13.405
Let's call her collateral damage, hmm?

13:17.866 --> 13:19.294
Ferguson?!

13:19.669 --> 13:22.859
You freak! You freak!

13:22.865 --> 13:24.561
No. No!

13:24.567 --> 13:26.368
- That'll do, Smith. Back in...
- No! No!

13:26.373 --> 13:27.984
No. You don't understand. It was her!

13:27.990 --> 13:29.381
- Come on.
- She did it!

13:29.387 --> 13:30.615
That'll do!

13:31.294 --> 13:34.614
I'll see you in court,
you fucking psycho!

13:34.620 --> 13:35.820
No!

13:40.034 --> 13:42.435
Can't you just try the hospital?
There might be an update.

13:43.616 --> 13:45.702
Oi. Anyone home?

13:45.707 --> 13:47.735
I've told you. There's no news.

13:47.741 --> 13:49.381
I asked to see Mr Jackson, where is he?

13:49.387 --> 13:51.091
I don't know. I'm not his PA.

13:51.097 --> 13:52.297
Can you find out?

13:52.566 --> 13:54.387
I've got a job to do.

13:55.884 --> 13:58.581
Oh, for fuck sake. I
don't need a shrink.

13:58.587 --> 13:59.910
Heard you're in the wars.

13:59.916 --> 14:01.181
Yeah, I need to see Mr Jackson.

14:01.187 --> 14:03.214
- He's on his way.
- Good.

14:04.062 --> 14:05.865
Is there any news about Allie?

14:06.353 --> 14:08.259
She's still in a critical condition.

14:09.473 --> 14:10.981
She's going to be okay, yeah?

14:10.987 --> 14:13.568
Yeah. Soon as I hear anything,
Bea, I'll let you know.

14:13.574 --> 14:15.568
Right, but in the
meantime, if you need me,

14:15.574 --> 14:17.687
- yeah, call out, okay?
- Yeah.

14:17.910 --> 14:19.928
- You wanted see me?
- Yeah.

14:21.434 --> 14:23.027
Is this necessary?

14:27.374 --> 14:29.702
I thought it was Kaz who
gave Allie that hotshot,

14:29.708 --> 14:31.187
but it wasn't. It was Ferguson.

14:31.193 --> 14:32.983
- Ferguson was locked in Medical.
- No.

14:32.989 --> 14:34.359
She told me she did it.

14:35.368 --> 14:37.959
- Why would she do that?
- Why do you think?

14:38.148 --> 14:40.644
- Because I'm testifying against her.
- What proof do you have?

14:40.650 --> 14:42.546
She told me to my face.

14:44.146 --> 14:45.976
Do you see what this means?

14:46.109 --> 14:47.923
She's not planning on coming back.

14:47.929 --> 14:49.572
She's got something
planned for the outside.

14:49.577 --> 14:51.640
Look, I know this sounds crazy, but...

14:51.819 --> 14:54.145
- but I think that I can stop her.
- How?

14:55.048 --> 14:57.285
I just need to make one phone call.

14:57.449 --> 14:58.740
You're confined to Medical.

14:58.746 --> 15:00.061
- I can't let you out of here.
- Please.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.951
It's just one call. Please.

15:04.066 --> 15:05.443
Mr Jackson?

15:05.449 --> 15:07.442
Mr Jackson, please!

15:11.898 --> 15:13.879
- Come in!
- Thanks.

15:14.048 --> 15:15.269
Hi, Liz.

15:16.047 --> 15:18.364
Sonia told me they found Helen's body.

15:18.370 --> 15:20.211
It should have been the
breakthrough we needed.

15:20.472 --> 15:21.894
But according to Forensics,

15:21.900 --> 15:24.567
there's no corroborating
evidence linking it back to Sonia.

15:24.573 --> 15:26.105
What if she didn't do it?

15:27.648 --> 15:29.579
- Can I show you something?
- Yeah.

15:32.175 --> 15:34.211
- Now, it's quite confronting,
- Mm.

15:34.287 --> 15:37.895
but I just want you to understand
what we're dealing with. Okay?

15:38.044 --> 15:39.244
_

15:39.250 --> 15:40.450
Oh, God.

15:40.456 --> 15:41.656
Okay?

15:41.812 --> 15:44.332
Helen was struck on the
head and then strangled.

15:44.338 --> 15:47.040
According to Forensics,
her head was shaved,

15:47.046 --> 15:49.916
she was taken to the middle of nowhere
and dumped like a bag of rubbish.

15:49.922 --> 15:51.462
Oh, God.

15:52.455 --> 15:54.455
Why did they shave her head?

15:54.567 --> 15:57.980
But why would Sonia do any
of this? Cause she's sick.

15:58.189 --> 16:00.800
We're dealing with a
cold, calculating killer.

16:01.501 --> 16:05.409
Now, I've got evidence linking
Helen's body to the boot of her car.

16:05.415 --> 16:07.820
I've got her blood at Sonia's house.

16:07.826 --> 16:11.146
All I need is one more piece of
evidence and I can clinch this.

16:11.152 --> 16:13.134
I can put her away for life, Liz.

16:14.008 --> 16:15.437
But I need your help.

16:16.900 --> 16:18.101
How?

16:18.536 --> 16:19.740
Well...

16:20.731 --> 16:22.858
if you make a statement and testify

16:22.864 --> 16:24.747
that Sonia privately
confessed to the murder

16:24.753 --> 16:27.528
of her best friend and her
husband, we can get a conviction.

16:28.145 --> 16:29.863
- You want me to lie for you?
- Nuh,

16:29.869 --> 16:31.237
- I don't want you to lie. Nuh,
- You want me to lie.

16:31.242 --> 16:33.643
if we don't do something, she's
gonna get away with murder.

16:33.649 --> 16:36.027
Liz, I wouldn't ask you to do this

16:36.033 --> 16:39.295
unless I was 100%
certain she's pure evil.

16:40.094 --> 16:42.043
Now, if you do this...

16:42.478 --> 16:46.220
you'll be free. She'll be locked away
for life, and that's it, it's over.

16:46.806 --> 16:50.097
When you're on parole,
we could go somewhere.

16:50.821 --> 16:52.205
Somewhere nice.

16:53.346 --> 16:54.546
Hey?

17:01.867 --> 17:03.173
You've been...

17:03.179 --> 17:05.626
you've been playing me
this whole friggin' time.

17:05.632 --> 17:07.549
- Oh, no.
- Was this all part of the plan, was it?

17:07.554 --> 17:10.198
A little bit of flirting and a
couple of free friggin' cupcakes

17:10.204 --> 17:12.388
and coffee, and she'll
do whatever I want.

17:12.395 --> 17:14.175
- Well, mate, you can think again.
- No.

17:14.181 --> 17:16.894
- Yeah, I thought we were a team.
- No, no, no. Sonia is devastated,

17:16.898 --> 17:19.204
and you are persecuting
an innocent woman.

17:19.211 --> 17:21.413
So, from now on, mate,
you can count me out.

17:21.419 --> 17:22.778
- Liz, please...
- No!

17:25.403 --> 17:28.046
We're done. Guard.

17:44.653 --> 17:46.348
Kate, give us a minute, please.

17:46.354 --> 17:47.830
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

17:57.024 --> 17:58.228
That's a contraband.

17:58.233 --> 18:01.162
Make sure you get rid of that when
you get sent back to your unit, please.

18:01.168 --> 18:02.564
One call, right?

18:03.472 --> 18:04.672
Thank you.

18:21.853 --> 18:24.038
- Franky.
- Franky, it's Bea.

18:24.044 --> 18:26.468
Ferguson's left for court, but
there's something going down.

18:26.474 --> 18:28.780
- You sure?
- She tried to kill Allie.

18:28.786 --> 18:30.272
She admitted to it.

18:30.278 --> 18:32.059
She thinks she's not coming back.

18:32.065 --> 18:35.182
Oh, shit. Shayne didn't turn
up at community service today.

18:35.188 --> 18:36.451
I've been trying to get a hold of him.

18:36.456 --> 18:38.280
What if he's taking
the fall for Ferguson?

18:38.286 --> 18:40.458
No, he's not on the witness
list. I checked that.

18:40.611 --> 18:41.816
Who is?

18:41.822 --> 18:43.634
Uh, quite a load of people.

18:43.640 --> 18:47.017
Uh, you, Vera, Nils Jesper,

18:47.023 --> 18:48.558
- Fletch.
- It's Jesper.

18:48.564 --> 18:50.274
They were using Shayne to get to him.

18:50.280 --> 18:51.487
How?

18:51.493 --> 18:54.197
- Is he called today?
- Yeah, he's first up.

18:54.946 --> 18:56.784
Without him, they don't have a case.

18:56.790 --> 18:58.377
- You need to find Shayne.
- _

18:58.383 --> 18:59.891
He's our only link to Ferguson.

18:59.897 --> 19:01.356
All right, I'm on it.

19:14.026 --> 19:15.540
- Where's Shayne?
- I dunno.

19:15.546 --> 19:17.334
- Is he here?
- Fuckin' hell, man.

19:17.341 --> 19:19.531
I told him to ask before
he borrows my wheels.

19:19.537 --> 19:21.427
- Was your red Commodore, yeah?
- Yeah.

19:35.975 --> 19:37.207
Stop hassling me.

19:37.213 --> 19:39.412
Hey, it's okay. you're not in trouble.
I just want to talk to you, okay?

19:39.417 --> 19:40.897
Where are you? I'll buy you a coffee.

19:43.606 --> 19:45.811
- I'm busy.
- Busy where?

19:48.938 --> 19:50.852
Mate, you're not at
the courthouse, are ya?

19:50.858 --> 19:53.131
- I'm turning my phone off.
- Shayne, I just...

19:59.085 --> 20:01.540
He's not in Ferguson's house,
and I reckon he's at the court.

20:03.328 --> 20:06.133
Franky, you've got to go to the
police. You gotta tell them everything.

20:06.138 --> 20:08.463
No, if I get the cops
involved, they'll arrest him.

20:08.469 --> 20:10.463
You can't protect him anymore.

20:10.759 --> 20:12.894
If I can find him, I can stop him.

20:12.900 --> 20:14.172
Please go to the police!

20:14.178 --> 20:16.439
No, trust me, I'll find him.

20:30.053 --> 20:32.139
I don't know what to do, Liz.

20:32.145 --> 20:33.486
What are you worried about, love?

20:33.491 --> 20:35.867
I hate just... Josh being far away.

20:35.873 --> 20:37.101
Oh, Dor.

20:37.107 --> 20:39.280
Why don't go and have
a talk to Ms Bennett?

20:39.286 --> 20:41.213
Put in for a transfer.

20:41.592 --> 20:43.306
- What, to Perth?
- Yeah.

20:43.312 --> 20:46.370
You don't have long till parole
and you got a pretty good case.

20:46.376 --> 20:47.985
- Yep.
- Yeah.

20:47.991 --> 20:50.304
- I'll think about it. Thanks, Liz.
- Mm.

20:50.310 --> 20:52.110
Hey, you okay?

20:52.179 --> 20:53.979
The screw said you
might have concussion.

20:53.985 --> 20:56.499
- No, I'm fine.
- Is there any news from the hospital?

20:56.601 --> 20:57.801
Nup.

20:57.807 --> 21:00.029
Smiles is escorting me
for an appointment later.

21:00.328 --> 21:03.228
- I'll see if I can visit. Okay.
- Oh, thanks.

21:03.234 --> 21:07.019
Hey, look, I-I'm sorry, everyone. I-I...
I'm gonna lie down. Doctor's orders.

21:07.025 --> 21:08.509
Ah, that's all right, love.

21:09.001 --> 21:12.126
- Um, I need to ask a favour.
- Yeah?

21:13.274 --> 21:16.693
- My hair has started to fall out...
- Oh, Max.

21:16.699 --> 21:19.055
and I think it might
be time to shave it off.

21:19.061 --> 21:20.285
Wow.

21:20.895 --> 21:22.099
Yeah, well, we'll

21:22.105 --> 21:23.414
- help you with that, eh?
- Yeah.

21:23.418 --> 21:25.358
Yeah, I can knit you
a new tea cosy to wear

21:25.364 --> 21:27.576
- till it grows back, love.
- Great.

21:28.083 --> 21:30.533
All right, well, who
wants to do the honours?

21:30.539 --> 21:32.613
Ah, me... me? I'll... me?

21:32.619 --> 21:33.854
- Aww.
- Good on ya, Booms. Okay.

21:33.859 --> 21:35.173
- Go, Booms.
- All right.

21:35.179 --> 21:37.931
- Ah, so I'll just chuck this on you?
- Yeah.

21:37.937 --> 21:39.257
- Right...
- That's it.

21:39.263 --> 21:40.472
Ooh.

21:40.478 --> 21:42.793
- Don't take my ear off.
- No. Um...

21:42.799 --> 21:44.357
how... how do I do it?

21:44.363 --> 21:45.671
I'll show you.

21:46.007 --> 21:47.212
Yeah?

21:47.499 --> 21:48.949
Oh, what really?

21:52.507 --> 21:56.749
- Okay. Tilt. Just slightly.
- Okay.

21:56.755 --> 21:57.955
Lovely.

22:11.502 --> 22:16.499
Some religions believe
hair is pure adornment.

22:18.612 --> 22:21.166
Stripping someone of their hair...

22:23.948 --> 22:25.651
is a sign of surrender...

22:26.235 --> 22:27.835
and humility.

22:33.051 --> 22:34.861
But it can also be...

22:37.499 --> 22:39.090
a rebirth.

22:39.096 --> 22:41.049
You've done this before, eh?

22:44.615 --> 22:47.964
I've already told the other lady I'm
not a relative, I'm just a friend.

22:48.991 --> 22:52.215
Yeah, I'm just calling
to find out how she is.

22:53.897 --> 22:55.688
Why the fuck should that matter?!

22:55.694 --> 22:57.087
I'm still her friend.

22:59.632 --> 23:00.832
Hello?

23:08.847 --> 23:10.220
You were right.

23:10.499 --> 23:11.709
What did Sonia say?

23:11.715 --> 23:12.988
Nothing.

23:13.696 --> 23:17.109
She's been playing me this whole
time and I can see that now.

23:18.639 --> 23:20.437
Poor Helen and her kids.

23:20.844 --> 23:22.355
It's bloody awful.

23:23.727 --> 23:26.530
- They deserve justice.
- Hm.

23:27.688 --> 23:29.200
So you'll make a statement?

23:29.206 --> 23:30.813
Just tell me what to say.

23:35.305 --> 23:36.715
Thank you.

23:37.489 --> 23:39.221
You're doing the right thing.

24:19.986 --> 24:21.769
Thanks, Helen. We are outside court

24:21.774 --> 24:25.608
awaiting the imminent arrival of former
Wentworth Governor, Joan Ferguson.

24:25.614 --> 24:27.419
Today the prosecution's star witness

24:27.424 --> 24:30.028
is expected to claim that
Miss Ferguson paid him

24:30.034 --> 24:32.355
to facilitate the murder of Harry Smith,

24:32.361 --> 24:35.373
husband of notorious
Wentworth inmate, Bea Smith,

24:35.379 --> 24:36.926
as well as the attempted murder

24:36.932 --> 24:39.461
of former prison
officer, Matthew Fletcher.

24:49.466 --> 24:51.193
How do you feel about
today, Ms Ferguson?

24:51.198 --> 24:52.474
- Joan?! Joan!
- Can we get a quote,

24:52.479 --> 24:53.926
- please, Ms Ferguson?
- Joan!

24:53.932 --> 24:56.664
Joan, are you feeling up today.
Are you feeling confident?

25:00.781 --> 25:02.898
Joan, can we get a comment, please?

25:04.506 --> 25:06.196
Have you anything to
say at all, Ms Ferguson?

25:06.201 --> 25:08.257
Taking into consideration
you are ex-Governor

25:08.263 --> 25:09.788
of the prison, how do you feel today?

25:28.743 --> 25:31.047
Look, we're gonna run
into some cut backs.

25:31.053 --> 25:32.842
How long do you think this is gonna be?

25:40.259 --> 25:41.551
Get off me!

25:42.260 --> 25:44.856
- Fucking let go!
- You wanna push off, be my guest!

25:44.862 --> 25:46.868
There are cops around the
corner and they'll come runnin'.

25:46.873 --> 25:49.534
- And what the fuck are you doin' here?
- I wanted to see Aunty Joan.

25:49.539 --> 25:50.762
Well, it's too late. She's inside, so

25:50.767 --> 25:52.744
- get outta here.
- You can't tell me what to do, Franky.

25:52.749 --> 25:55.128
All right, I'll take
ya home myself. Come on.

25:55.524 --> 25:56.859
Fuck!

26:04.904 --> 26:06.680
I've got a message, Shayne.

26:06.686 --> 26:08.474
Just put it away before someone sees ya.

26:08.480 --> 26:10.692
I'm gonna use it. I swear.

26:11.092 --> 26:12.659
I believe ya.

26:12.665 --> 26:14.608
But just put it away so we can talk.

26:14.614 --> 26:16.899
You fucking used me, Franky.

26:16.905 --> 26:19.009
Well, what's Ferguson
doin' right now, huh?

26:19.016 --> 26:21.027
What's she makin' you do?
Commit murder? For what?

26:21.033 --> 26:22.853
She doesn't deserve to be in jail.

26:22.859 --> 26:24.255
What's she tellin' you?

26:24.261 --> 26:26.373
That this is for some
noble fuckin' cause?

26:26.379 --> 26:28.786
She manipulated you.
That's what she does.

26:28.792 --> 26:30.923
She fuckin' got in your
head and she fucked you up.

26:30.929 --> 26:34.393
That's crap. You're just
like the cops, makin' shit up.

26:34.399 --> 26:36.902
- She doesn't care about you.
- What the fuck would you know?!

26:36.908 --> 26:39.390
- She doesn't care about anyone.
- Shut up!

26:40.076 --> 26:42.982
You don't know shit.
Fuckin' lawyer bitch!

26:43.260 --> 26:45.044
You people killed my mum.

26:45.271 --> 26:48.655
You put me in ten
different foster homes.

26:48.661 --> 26:51.539
- I know all about foster homes.
- We're not the same, Franky.

26:51.545 --> 26:53.944
No, we're not because you
haven't crossed that line yet.

26:54.458 --> 26:56.733
I did and I went to
prison for a long time.

26:56.739 --> 26:58.779
Now, trust me, you don't want
that 'cause it nearly killed me.

26:58.784 --> 27:00.599
- Shut up.
- You use that gun today

27:00.605 --> 27:03.397
- and we are the same.
- Shut the fuck up, Franky!

27:05.039 --> 27:07.367
You reckon your mum would
want to see you like this?

27:07.523 --> 27:09.633
You reckon your mum would
let you kill someone?

27:09.639 --> 27:11.774
- You don't know shit.
- She'd be doing everything she could

27:11.779 --> 27:13.659
to stop you because you're
not a killer, Shayne.

27:13.665 --> 27:17.015
But you pull that trigger
and everythin' changes.

27:17.694 --> 27:19.914
This is where you decide who you are.

27:22.299 --> 27:23.676
Just put it down.

27:23.779 --> 27:26.378
Just put it down, Shayne, please!

27:27.782 --> 27:29.525
Just put it down, mate.

27:30.240 --> 27:31.440
Come on.

27:42.015 --> 27:44.257
I got ya. It's okay.

27:44.933 --> 27:46.133
It's okay.

27:47.015 --> 27:48.280
Hey...

27:49.147 --> 27:51.321
I want you to get in your
car and get out of here.

27:51.327 --> 27:53.909
I'll take the gun and I'll meet
you back at the house, okay?

27:55.292 --> 27:57.222
- I'm going to be in trouble.
- No, you're not.

27:57.228 --> 27:59.824
I'm gonna clear it with community
services, don't you worry.

28:01.693 --> 28:03.183
I'm proud of ya.

28:04.942 --> 28:06.142
You're good.

28:06.324 --> 28:07.871
Now go, go on.

28:08.830 --> 28:10.030
Go.

28:37.841 --> 28:41.359
_

29:08.937 --> 29:10.988
Get the fuck out of the car!

29:14.776 --> 29:17.183
Hey, what the fuck's goin' on out there?

29:22.136 --> 29:24.376
Hey, what's happening?

29:39.495 --> 29:41.934
VKC to City 610.

29:41.940 --> 29:44.973
The Walford prisoners'
transfer is unresponsive.

29:44.979 --> 29:47.744
I repeat, they are unresponsive.

29:47.750 --> 29:48.950
Okay.

29:52.633 --> 29:55.526
Nils Jesper's brawler has gone missing.

29:55.532 --> 29:56.738
What do you mean, gone missing?

29:56.743 --> 29:59.302
It left Walford and never
turned up at the courthouse.

29:59.309 --> 30:00.868
Jesus Christ!

30:01.814 --> 30:04.002
If Jesper's not found,
they don't have a case.

30:04.008 --> 30:05.927
The others are just
corroborating witnesses.

30:05.933 --> 30:07.561
Okay, let's see what the police turn up.

30:08.774 --> 30:10.248
Thanks for letting me know.

30:10.254 --> 30:11.770
That's not why I called you here.

30:12.281 --> 30:18.106
Your medical test returned
positive for class A drugs.

30:19.693 --> 30:21.388
Did you supply Allie Novak?

30:22.372 --> 30:23.873
You really think I'd do that?

30:23.879 --> 30:26.848
I had to ask. You were the only
officer to return a positive test.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.005
Okay. Ah, yes...

30:29.011 --> 30:31.579
I did take something,
but it was a while ago.

30:31.585 --> 30:34.250
- Okay, it's a one-off.
- Mm. Right. But it was there.

30:34.256 --> 30:35.875
And it registered.

30:35.959 --> 30:39.049
So, now I have no choice but to
suspend you pending an investigation.

30:39.055 --> 30:40.322
- What?
- I'm sorry, Will.

30:40.328 --> 30:42.968
You can finish your shift and then
I have to notify the department.

30:50.710 --> 30:52.082
Fuck!

31:05.500 --> 31:06.965
Who the fuck are you?

32:20.219 --> 32:21.891
_

32:29.155 --> 32:30.361
- How are you feeling?
- Yeah...

32:30.366 --> 32:32.061
- Are you feeling all right?
- I'm fine. I'm okay.

32:32.066 --> 32:33.378
Fantastic!

32:36.202 --> 32:37.855
- Booms, you okay?
- Mm.

32:37.861 --> 32:39.061
Yep.

32:39.177 --> 32:41.528
Just onions or some... somethin', eh?

32:41.534 --> 32:43.451
Maxine's going to be fine, you know?

32:43.457 --> 32:44.676
You don't know that.

32:44.682 --> 32:46.418
Oh, she's got a lot to live for.

32:46.424 --> 32:48.752
Specially now, eh? With a bub.

32:48.758 --> 32:50.238
Darl, what's the matter?

32:50.244 --> 32:51.947
- Nuh.
- What?

32:52.248 --> 32:53.760
Ah, I'm not pregnant.

32:53.766 --> 32:56.636
Oh frig, Booms, I'm so sorry.

32:56.642 --> 32:58.196
Just act normal, all right?

32:58.202 --> 32:59.478
- Just act normal 'cause I don't want
- Yep.

32:59.483 --> 33:01.422
- Maxie to be upset. Yeah.
- All right then.

33:01.428 --> 33:03.591
- Blow your nose, wipe your eyes.
- Yeah.

33:03.981 --> 33:05.480
- Off we go.
- Yeah.

33:05.712 --> 33:09.319
- Hey, what's the hold up?
- Piss off, Tina.

33:09.325 --> 33:12.670
Are you gonna take Bea's place
or what? We had a deal, remember?

33:12.676 --> 33:13.876
Just leave me alone.

33:13.882 --> 33:15.969
Step up before someone else does.

33:19.151 --> 33:21.868
She's right. You should do this.

33:21.873 --> 33:25.065
I don't wanna do this. Let
somebody step up if they want to.

33:26.017 --> 33:29.355
The women need a leader,
and they want you.

33:32.415 --> 33:34.321
Ah, yes, I-I... I want an update

33:34.335 --> 33:36.817
on a patient by the name of Allie Novak.

33:37.105 --> 33:38.902
Yes, I-I... I'm her sister.

33:39.702 --> 33:41.090
Thank you.

33:44.920 --> 33:46.639
_

33:46.770 --> 33:48.751
Oh, fuck!

34:00.659 --> 34:03.539
Are you happy with what
happened? What about the outcome?

34:03.666 --> 34:05.183
How are you feeling today?

34:05.188 --> 34:06.989
Nils Jesper has been found dead.

34:06.995 --> 34:09.694
- Jesus Christ!
- Without him, they don't have a case.

34:09.699 --> 34:11.589
Ferguson's charges
will have to be dropped.

34:11.594 --> 34:13.810
So, Bea was right.
Ferguson was up to something.

34:13.815 --> 34:16.059
This was her plan all
along. Getting into general,

34:16.065 --> 34:18.266
finding someone who could
help her, she made this happen.

34:18.271 --> 34:20.190
She's gonna come after your job, Vera.

34:21.277 --> 34:22.498
I know.

34:23.580 --> 34:24.853
Oh, well...

34:25.398 --> 34:27.078
looks like you did me a favour.

34:31.516 --> 34:32.806
Thanks for nothing.

34:36.416 --> 34:37.799
What's up with Jackson?

34:37.804 --> 34:39.685
He returned a positive drug test.

34:39.690 --> 34:42.768
He's been suspended, and you'll
be acting Deputy Governor.

34:42.956 --> 34:44.290
Come with me.

35:20.934 --> 35:23.125
Please complete the paperwork
as quickly as possible.

35:23.131 --> 35:25.002
I have things to do.

35:33.361 --> 35:37.140
Shayne was a backup plan.
The real hit was someone else.

35:37.146 --> 35:39.763
It was too risky trustin'
a kid, even for Ferguson.

35:39.769 --> 35:42.458
And every one of us who's
crossed her, we're all in danger.

35:42.558 --> 35:43.763
That's... fuck.

35:47.369 --> 35:49.293
She's already started.

35:52.624 --> 35:54.305
From what you told me,

35:54.311 --> 35:56.271
Allie sounds like a real fighter.

35:56.538 --> 35:57.818
Yeah, she is.

35:59.221 --> 36:00.421
You'd like her.

36:00.758 --> 36:02.351
Don't give up on her, okay?

36:02.438 --> 36:03.648
No.

36:04.656 --> 36:05.860
No.

36:07.953 --> 36:09.288
No, she's, ah...

36:11.406 --> 36:12.610
she's...

36:16.070 --> 36:18.155
I've never felt like this before.

36:20.842 --> 36:22.188
It's nice.

36:22.373 --> 36:23.592
Bea...

36:23.980 --> 36:25.966
uh, I need you to come with me.

36:26.661 --> 36:27.861
Why?

36:29.569 --> 36:31.288
We should talk somewhere else.

36:36.522 --> 36:37.830
Just tell me.

36:38.092 --> 36:40.709
Um, there's... there's
news from the hospital.

36:40.715 --> 36:43.395
I've arranged a, uh... a
phone call with Miss Miles.

36:56.506 --> 36:58.226
It's Jackson, put it through.

37:00.808 --> 37:02.248
Maxine's with her.

37:06.567 --> 37:07.767
Hello?

37:08.448 --> 37:10.159
They've let us in to see her.

37:10.165 --> 37:11.565
Can she hear me?

37:11.571 --> 37:12.771
Yeah.

37:14.728 --> 37:16.040
Allie?

37:16.343 --> 37:17.779
Allie, it's me.

37:20.538 --> 37:22.742
Beautiful, you can wake up now,

37:22.748 --> 37:24.082
okay?

37:24.088 --> 37:26.496
You're stronger than
this. You know that.

37:26.502 --> 37:29.517
I want you to stop messing
around and wake up, okay?

37:29.523 --> 37:31.111
Just wake up.

37:31.488 --> 37:33.010
Please wake up.

37:35.288 --> 37:38.437
She's developed this thing
called acute respiratory syndrome.

37:38.822 --> 37:40.708
She can't breathe on her own.

37:41.503 --> 37:42.713
Uh...

37:43.571 --> 37:45.766
w-what are you... what are you saying?

37:47.083 --> 37:50.420
I'm so sorry, Bea. The doctor
said there's nothing they can do.

37:59.675 --> 38:00.882
Oh, fuck.

38:06.861 --> 38:08.861
It's so unfair.

38:25.090 --> 38:26.490
Allie...

38:29.896 --> 38:31.686
It's gonna be okay.

38:35.354 --> 38:36.992
You just fly.

38:38.245 --> 38:39.792
You be free.

38:43.232 --> 38:46.470
You go and find Debbie
and you look after her.

38:50.928 --> 38:52.588
And you wait for me.

38:54.305 --> 38:55.945
You wait.

39:03.329 --> 39:05.449
I love you, beautiful girl.

39:34.835 --> 39:36.035
Governor?

39:38.450 --> 39:40.271
I need to speak to you.

39:40.457 --> 39:44.328
If you wanna trap Ferguson,
we've got one last chance.

39:44.334 --> 39:46.662
Now, I don't know how she
got out of that holding cell,

39:47.058 --> 39:49.223
but it was Ferguson who
gave Allie that hotshot.

39:49.229 --> 39:51.669
- There is no way.
- She did it to get to me.

39:52.221 --> 39:53.976
She told me herself.

39:55.104 --> 39:57.152
But Allie's not gonna wake up,

39:57.714 --> 39:59.247
so that makes it murder.

39:59.253 --> 40:00.870
Do you have any evidence?

40:02.929 --> 40:04.774
- But I could get it.
- How?

40:05.749 --> 40:08.460
All I need from you is access to her.

40:08.656 --> 40:11.763
Then I can provoke her, get
details and record her with this.

40:12.999 --> 40:14.740
You know I can't do
that. Give me the phone.

40:14.746 --> 40:17.638
And you know that once Ferguson
is released, we're all in the shit.

40:19.519 --> 40:21.399
This is our only chance.

40:21.589 --> 40:24.930
She'll be surrounded by officers until
she leaves, she'll make sure of it.

40:26.109 --> 40:27.612
Just get me to her.

40:28.712 --> 40:30.352

Joan Ferguson's ready

43:10.375 --> 43:13.086
Would you give us a moment, Mr Stewart?

43:28.084 --> 43:29.324
Thank you.

43:32.037 --> 43:33.284
Hmm.

43:34.334 --> 43:36.540
You can't intimidate me.

43:37.714 --> 43:40.808
All the things you've done
don't make you powerful.

43:41.131 --> 43:42.735
They make you sick.

43:43.501 --> 43:45.452
I'll let you keep the badge....

43:46.203 --> 43:47.738
as a memento.

43:58.852 --> 44:00.453
See you all soon.

44:04.161 --> 44:07.608

44:10.200 --> 44:11.834
_

44:53.337 --> 44:54.537
Out of my way.

44:56.078 --> 44:57.663
Are you scared?

45:10.588 --> 45:12.041
What's it like?

45:14.409 --> 45:17.046
Hmm? Knowing you're gonna die.

45:17.717 --> 45:19.526
You're being very stupid.

45:19.532 --> 45:21.052
Is your chest tight?

45:22.723 --> 45:24.922
Heart pumping in your ears?

45:27.121 --> 45:28.602
Fight or flight?

45:32.969 --> 45:34.747
This is it, Freak.

45:35.354 --> 45:38.285
This is for every life
you've taken or fucked over.

45:39.013 --> 45:42.216
Yeah, what was that girl's
name at Blackmore? Jianna? Mm.

45:43.387 --> 45:46.068
Simmo, Jodie...

45:50.542 --> 45:51.953
Allie.

46:05.785 --> 46:07.527
I'm gonna finish this.

46:10.194 --> 46:11.440
Oh!

46:13.427 --> 46:14.627
Oh!

46:50.193 --> 46:51.677
No. No.

46:52.383 --> 46:53.623
Argh!

47:01.455 --> 47:03.029
You want it.

47:23.371 --> 47:25.118
I win.
