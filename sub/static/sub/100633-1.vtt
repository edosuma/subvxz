00:25.091 --> 00:27.628
My fellow Americans,
it's been decades

00:27.628 --> 00:31.364
since Gotham City
once exemplified
American prosperity.

00:31.431 --> 00:34.468
<i>But one week ago,</i>
<i>it hit the point of no return</i>

00:34.534 --> 00:36.402
when the Joker seized control

00:36.469 --> 00:38.304
<i>and instituted martial law.</i>

00:38.371 --> 00:39.673
-[static on tv]
<i>-Last night,</i>

00:39.740 --> 00:41.475
<i>his base of operations,</i>
<i>the Joker Tower,</i>

00:41.542 --> 00:43.100
<i>came crashing to the ground,</i>

00:43.100 --> 00:46.646
<i>triggering an 8.6 earthquake</i>
<i>that leveled the city.</i>

00:46.713 --> 00:48.781
Sadly, Gotham is beyond saving.

00:48.848 --> 00:51.084
-[all gasp]
-So it is with a heavy heart

00:51.151 --> 00:53.654
that I hereby declare
that Gotham City

00:53.720 --> 00:56.289
is no longer part
of the United States.

00:56.356 --> 00:58.859
<i>It is civitas non grata.</i>

00:58.926 --> 01:01.127
God bless the
United States of America,

01:01.194 --> 01:02.829
and God help Gotham City.

01:04.697 --> 01:06.533
Fuck yeah!

01:06.599 --> 01:08.468

01:33.793 --> 01:35.528
[horn approaching]

01:37.563 --> 01:39.132
Home, sweet home.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.569
Good job,
my little baby drivers.

01:42.635 --> 01:43.771
I got a treat for ya.

01:45.504 --> 01:47.908
Now, Bud and Lou,
don't you fight.

01:47.974 --> 01:49.843
There's one for each of ya.

01:49.909 --> 01:51.510
And for my big babies,

01:51.578 --> 01:53.480
I brought dinner!

01:53.546 --> 01:54.748
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.415
Those beasts get steak

01:56.483 --> 01:57.850
and we gotta eat this guy?

01:57.918 --> 01:59.819
Are we living
in a mall or a zoo?

01:59.887 --> 02:01.822
I like to think of it
as both now.

02:01.888 --> 02:03.290
No, we're not eating him.

02:03.355 --> 02:05.257
This is Takashi,
a sushi chef.

02:05.325 --> 02:07.227
He's got a Michelin star!
[grunts]

02:07.293 --> 02:08.360
I gotta admit,

02:08.427 --> 02:09.695
I was excited
to eat a person,

02:09.763 --> 02:12.231
especially since
I already had sushi,

02:12.299 --> 02:13.400
but I guess it's fine.

02:13.467 --> 02:14.935
Come here!

02:15.002 --> 02:17.670
Takashi, would it be gauche
to ask for a spider roll,

02:17.737 --> 02:19.438
or are you strictly <i>omakase?</i>

02:19.506 --> 02:22.175
Ive, are you not jazzed
about sushi?

02:22.241 --> 02:24.443
No, no. I mean,
I like Takashi's hand rolls

02:24.510 --> 02:25.611
as much as the next gal,

02:25.679 --> 02:26.913
but don't you think it's time

02:26.913 --> 02:28.414
to kinda like
wrap up this party up?

02:28.414 --> 02:29.650
You know, it's been three weeks

02:29.650 --> 02:30.717
since you
took down Joker.

02:30.783 --> 02:31.919
There's no Legion of Doom.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.000
No Batman.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.587
Gotham is yours
for the taking.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.423
I am having a blast!

02:36.423 --> 02:38.191
This is what
I've always wanted, Ive.

02:38.258 --> 02:40.259
Anarchy and sushi!

02:40.326 --> 02:42.429
[horn blares]

02:42.496 --> 02:44.931
Yeah, I mean, you definitely
could've had better sushi

02:44.998 --> 02:46.633
when Gotham had refrigeration

02:46.699 --> 02:48.634
and free trade with
the rest of America, but...

02:48.701 --> 02:50.503
[blech] Is this a bird?

02:50.569 --> 02:51.569
Trust me. Seriously,

02:51.569 --> 02:52.673
you're gonna be
kicking yourself

02:52.673 --> 02:53.855
if you don't take charge.

02:53.855 --> 02:56.543
Ive, the best part of living
in an apocalyptic wasteland

02:56.610 --> 02:58.478
is no one's in charge.

02:58.544 --> 02:59.544
Whoo!

02:59.579 --> 03:01.480
[horn blares]

03:01.548 --> 03:03.349
It's chaos, baby!

03:03.349 --> 03:06.854
It's like 'Nam
after the U.S. pulled out.

03:06.919 --> 03:09.389
-[explosions]
-[sighs]

03:09.389 --> 03:10.691
I don't think
it's exactly like that.

03:10.691 --> 03:11.758
But it is pretty awesome.

03:11.758 --> 03:13.961
Hey! You're on Penguin turf.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.729
Get the hell outta here.

03:15.795 --> 03:17.296
The hell ya talking 'bout?

03:17.364 --> 03:18.966
Penguin called
dibs on the mall.

03:18.966 --> 03:21.467
Uh, we've been chilling
at the mall for, like, ever!

03:21.534 --> 03:24.503
And dibs?
There's no dibs.

03:24.570 --> 03:26.338
The city's in ruins, idiot.

03:26.406 --> 03:27.540
It's a post-dibs world.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.308
Nobody owns nothing.

03:29.308 --> 03:30.342
Except for me!

03:30.409 --> 03:31.444
I own this mall.

03:31.510 --> 03:33.580
It's chaos, baby!

03:33.646 --> 03:37.349
It's like 'Nam
after the U.S. pulled out.

03:37.349 --> 03:39.000
-[explosion]
-[frustrated] Stop, stop, stop!

03:39.000 --> 03:40.252
[softly] No flashbacks.

03:40.319 --> 03:41.487
So you go back
to the Penguin

03:41.487 --> 03:42.855
and tell him to go
screw himself.

03:42.923 --> 03:44.491
-[grunt]
-[chomps]

03:44.557 --> 03:45.557
Hey, Takashi.

03:45.557 --> 03:47.728
Can you incorporate
this into a rainbow roll?

03:47.794 --> 03:49.963
Light on the rice. [laughs]

03:50.030 --> 03:51.300
I'm watching my figure.

03:51.300 --> 03:52.566
Harley, this is what's
going to happen

03:52.566 --> 03:53.854
if you don't take control.

03:53.854 --> 03:56.269
Every one of these assholes
has an army of goons

03:56.269 --> 03:58.305
that they're just
gonna keep sending
until they take over the city.

03:58.371 --> 03:59.939
I think you may be
catastrophizing.

03:59.939 --> 04:01.008
[explosion]

04:03.076 --> 04:05.945
Hey! You're on Two-Face's turf.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.881
Don't make that face at me.

04:07.948 --> 04:08.949
Fine, I'll deal with it.

04:09.984 --> 04:11.518
Listen up, goons!

04:11.585 --> 04:13.620
Excuse me,
I identify as a hench.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.656
Listen up, goons and henches,

04:15.656 --> 04:17.591
the world we know has ended.

04:17.591 --> 04:21.560
The Justice League is kaput,
the Legion of Doom is doomed,

04:21.627 --> 04:23.463
and Joker's had his last laugh.

04:23.529 --> 04:26.966
This is our chance
to even the playing field.

04:27.033 --> 04:28.502
You! Who do you work for?

04:28.567 --> 04:30.069
The Riddler. Obviously.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.704
Seriously?
Two-Face. Come on.

04:31.771 --> 04:33.040
But why?

04:33.040 --> 04:36.309
What have those assholes
ever done for you?

04:36.310 --> 04:37.778
Joker treated me like shit,

04:37.778 --> 04:39.411
until I decided
I'd had enough

04:39.478 --> 04:41.014
and took him down.

04:41.081 --> 04:42.482
And look at me now.

04:42.548 --> 04:44.851
It is time to rise up!

04:44.851 --> 04:46.987
Everyone should be
their own villain.

04:47.053 --> 04:48.922
Don't work for the Penguin,

04:48.988 --> 04:50.124
be the Penguin.

04:50.124 --> 04:51.557
Over here, the hench...

04:51.557 --> 04:53.026
I've got a two part
question for ya.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.827
Are you saying
we should become
the Penguin,

04:54.827 --> 04:56.396
or that we should do
stuff like him?

04:56.463 --> 04:57.497
Up to you, goo...

04:57.564 --> 04:58.831
[blech] ...hench.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.432
This is New Gotham.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.036
The power isn't held
by the few,

05:02.036 --> 05:03.502
it's up for grabs.

05:03.569 --> 05:05.838
So everyone
should go get some.

or are you?

was just robbed
15 minutes ago

Citizens of New Gotham,
riddle me this...

05:39.805 --> 05:41.608
Citizens of New Gotham...

05:41.675 --> 05:43.677
Craig? What the hell
are you doing?

05:43.744 --> 05:45.778
[chuckles]
Who is this Craig
you speak of?

05:45.846 --> 05:48.982
I am the Inquizitor-or-or--

05:49.048 --> 05:50.084
Craig, get off the air!

05:50.149 --> 05:51.685
Here's a quizzy quiz.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.653
Who's not my boss anymore?

05:53.720 --> 05:55.088
You!

05:55.154 --> 05:57.057
We're cutting in live
from Penguin's casino

05:57.124 --> 05:58.925
and looks like
I'm the big winner today.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.961
Come and get it,
New Gotham!

06:05.798 --> 06:07.100
[Penguin] Are we all here?

06:07.166 --> 06:09.168
[sighs] We're missing one.

-This guy...
-Gentlemen,

06:22.149 --> 06:23.182
thank you for coming.

06:23.182 --> 06:24.985
Let me cut to the chase.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.620
Harley Quinn's
goon rebellion

06:27.620 --> 06:29.790
-...is destroying
our way of life.

06:29.855 --> 06:31.625
Stupid coffee machine!

06:31.690 --> 06:33.127
It's impossible to figure out!

06:33.192 --> 06:34.661
We need goons!

06:35.762 --> 06:37.831
Well... well, I loosened it up.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.098
Can I ask you
a serious question?

06:39.098 --> 06:40.134
Why are you so stupid?

06:40.134 --> 06:42.002
Incredibly, Bane is right.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.637
Not about the coffee maker,
but we need goons!

06:44.637 --> 06:46.439
Now they all think they're us.

06:46.439 --> 06:48.040
If everyone's a villain,
then no one is.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.910
And we need to
get them back in line.

06:49.911 --> 06:51.745
We need structure.
Right fellas?

06:51.812 --> 06:53.279
We can't run
organized crime...

06:53.279 --> 06:55.115
Uh... I'm not
in organized crime.

06:55.182 --> 06:56.682
I'm actually trying
to find a cure

06:56.750 --> 06:58.617
for my wife's
terminal illness.

06:58.685 --> 06:59.952
And how are you
funding that?

07:00.019 --> 07:01.954
Uh. Through organized crime.

07:02.021 --> 07:06.160
Exactly...
which we can't do with Harley
leading this insurrection!

07:06.226 --> 07:09.495
We need to get her on board
and get our goons back!

07:09.562 --> 07:12.132
Uh... one note,
one small note.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.533
Maybe we should have
invited her to this?

07:14.600 --> 07:16.401
-What?
-Shut it, Bane.

07:20.574 --> 07:21.875

No! This is the Bat-Signal,
not the Robin-Signal.

07:40.026 --> 07:41.494
Get out of here!
Shoo, shoo!

07:41.560 --> 07:43.029
Will you stop shooing me!

Batman is missing.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.300
[dramatic gasp] What?

07:45.300 --> 07:47.100
He was in the
Joker Tower when it fell...

07:47.100 --> 07:48.901
And I haven't
heard from him since.

07:48.901 --> 07:49.937
Oh, my God!

07:49.937 --> 07:50.937
Did you try texting him?

07:51.004 --> 07:52.939
Of course I tried texting him.

07:53.005 --> 07:53.874
What am I, 40?

07:53.940 --> 07:55.175
Course! Could...

07:55.175 --> 07:56.742
you share that
contact info with me?

07:56.742 --> 07:58.211
[hesitantly] Yeah.
He wouldn't like that.

07:58.211 --> 08:00.781
Plus that would mean
you have my info, too.

08:00.846 --> 08:02.649
C'mon!
The city's falling apart!

08:02.716 --> 08:05.218
-We need Batman, damn it!
-Whoa, whoa...

08:05.220 --> 08:06.220
He's gone.

08:06.220 --> 08:07.620
Which is why I'm here.

08:07.687 --> 08:09.555
'Cause I'm ready
to take up the mantle.

08:36.583 --> 08:37.650
just like you asked!

08:37.650 --> 08:38.951
[excitedly] Ginger!

08:39.019 --> 08:40.019
Hip, hip, hooray!

08:40.086 --> 08:41.654
Holy shit!

08:41.654 --> 08:43.623
It's about time,
what took you so long?

08:43.690 --> 08:45.557
Hey, you know,
it's pretty rough
out there, okay?

08:45.625 --> 08:48.061
I had to fight five new
question-based villains.

08:48.128 --> 08:49.596
Uh... [clears throat]

08:49.663 --> 08:50.697
Harley, a word.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.166
Is it "congratulations"?

08:52.167 --> 08:54.801
I stopped all the villains
by liberating the goons.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.070
Harls, this was your chance
to control the city,

08:57.136 --> 09:00.807
but now instead of like
five big assholes
trying to run Gotham,

09:00.874 --> 09:03.243
we've got a thousand
little assholes
to deal with.

09:03.309 --> 09:04.878
Ugh, you worry too much, Ive.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.980
Um...

09:07.000 --> 09:08.815
You know, I think I'm worrying
like the perfect amount,
to be honest.

09:08.815 --> 09:10.116
Thanks, Lou.
What'd ya bring me?

09:10.116 --> 09:12.052
"Harley Quinn,
you are cordially invited

09:12.052 --> 09:15.254
to attend the inaugural meeting
of the Injustice League."

09:15.322 --> 09:17.590
What is the
Injustice League?

09:17.657 --> 09:20.059
I believe it is a play
on "Justice League."

09:20.126 --> 09:23.163
Boy, will they have
a juicy lawsuit on their hands.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.999
Wonder woman
is very litigious. Trust me.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.368
This is bullshit.

09:27.433 --> 09:29.427
The city's
supposed to be chaos!

09:29.427 --> 09:32.839
You know, I'm trying to be
less of a know-it-all,
so I'm just gonna go read.

09:32.840 --> 09:33.907
[excitedly] I can't,
it's killing me,

09:33.907 --> 09:35.274
I told you so! Okay,

09:35.341 --> 09:36.342
[inhales deeply] Whoo!

09:36.409 --> 09:38.144
Now I'm going to go read.

09:38.211 --> 09:39.346
[Harley Quinn]
Hey motherfuckers.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.248
Look at that,
gang's all here.

09:41.315 --> 09:42.895
Freeze, been a minute.

09:42.895 --> 09:45.618
Bane, good to see you
on your feet
after the Legion went boom.

09:45.618 --> 09:50.090
Luckily I was away,
dog sitting for my Aunt
Linda's girlfriend.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.259
[softly] We're very supportive.

09:51.259 --> 09:52.259
Aw, that's nice.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.558
So, what's the deal?

09:53.558 --> 09:56.263
You guys get invites to this
Injustice League dealio too?

09:56.263 --> 09:58.000
-Actually, Harley...

09:58.865 --> 10:01.100

10:01.168 --> 10:03.636
Wait, wait. You guys
are the Injustice League?

10:03.702 --> 10:05.739
We had time
to get a banner made,

10:05.739 --> 10:08.841
but not enough
to find one more
executive chair?

10:08.908 --> 10:10.311
Oh, again with the
swivel chair.

10:10.376 --> 10:12.980
Your recklessness
forced us to band together

10:13.046 --> 10:15.081
to restore order
in the criminal underworld.

10:15.149 --> 10:16.817
There's gotta be a hierarchy.

10:16.817 --> 10:17.817
Exactly!

10:17.817 --> 10:19.686
It goes supervillains,
sidekicks,

10:19.753 --> 10:21.654
goons that went to Harvard,
and then goons.

10:21.721 --> 10:23.190
Okay. That's just
the same old shit.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.024
I mean. This is a chance
to do something new.

10:25.024 --> 10:27.059
Much gratitude
for the segue.

10:28.995 --> 10:30.062

10:30.129 --> 10:31.331

10:32.765 --> 10:34.434
Not. Interested.

10:34.501 --> 10:36.003
[exclaims] Whoa. Hey!

10:36.068 --> 10:37.837
Where did this
map come from?

10:37.903 --> 10:40.240
I'm still on a
goddamn folding chair.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.774
Jesus, Bane.

10:41.774 --> 10:43.076
we all thought
it would be funny

10:43.076 --> 10:44.445
if we gave you
a folding chair...

10:44.445 --> 10:45.812
-...and we were right!

10:49.316 --> 10:50.783
jest will be avenged.

10:51.451 --> 10:52.719
[uninterested] Anyway...

10:52.785 --> 10:54.200
we've divided up Gotham.

10:54.200 --> 10:58.057
Each of us
will control a territory
where we make our own rules.

10:58.125 --> 11:01.160
Which you could have seen
if we still had the map.

11:01.227 --> 11:03.263

was gonna yours?

11:03.330 --> 11:05.731
Hint, the bad part. [laughs]

so I make the rules.

11:08.969 --> 11:10.403
And this shit won't fly.

-Told ya.

Ivy, are you there?

11:22.049 --> 11:23.049
Can you hear me?

11:23.049 --> 11:24.049
Where am I?

11:24.049 --> 11:25.251
Riddle me this...

11:25.318 --> 11:27.921
Who's the biggest fool of all?

11:27.921 --> 11:31.725
You! For wasting
your only chance
to rule Gotham.

you wouldn't have
ended up like this.

You did this to yourself.

11:45.938 --> 11:47.908
You'll never be one of us.

they haven't.

Somewhere.

12:16.537 --> 12:18.404
[exhales]
I know things seem bleak.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.907
We're being hunted
by villains and citizens alike.

12:20.974 --> 12:22.322
No food, no power.

its back on us,

12:35.121 --> 12:37.157

Hit it, Sy.

17:39.526 --> 17:40.526
-[grunt]
-[tires screech]

17:40.560 --> 17:41.760
[laughs]

17:46.767 --> 17:48.201
-[grunt]
-[groans]

17:48.268 --> 17:52.806
Have at me!

17:52.806 --> 17:55.107
Somebody free my swinging arm!

17:55.174 --> 17:57.577
Fire finger, flame begin!

18:00.313 --> 18:02.281
-Ha! [grunt]
-[groaning]

18:04.217 --> 18:06.185
[men screaming]

18:06.185 --> 18:07.487
[Harley Quinn]
Sweep the leg Johnny!

18:07.487 --> 18:09.589
[cackles]

18:09.655 --> 18:14.655
-[men groaning]
-[Harley Quinn laughs]

18:15.796 --> 18:16.896
[grunt]

18:16.963 --> 18:18.265
-[screaming]
-[gun firing]

18:18.330 --> 18:19.332
[groans]

18:21.801 --> 18:23.169
[ice screeching]

18:26.205 --> 18:27.273
Harley...

18:27.339 --> 18:28.339
I always thought

18:28.339 --> 18:29.742
-you were a sidekick.
-[struggling]

18:29.742 --> 18:31.478
A goon with a name.

18:31.545 --> 18:32.679
But I was wrong.

18:32.746 --> 18:33.780
[grunt]

18:34.816 --> 18:35.816
Asshole.

18:35.816 --> 18:37.284
You're a mistake.

18:37.349 --> 18:38.919
A mutation.

18:38.986 --> 18:41.421
Thankfully,
nature has graced us
with a solution

18:41.488 --> 18:45.224
to the Harley Quinn problem,
survival of the fittest.

18:45.291 --> 18:46.291
[groans]

18:48.628 --> 18:50.696
[sobbing] My beautiful nose!

18:50.763 --> 18:52.531
-[screams]
-[grunts]

18:52.598 --> 18:53.700
[laughs]

18:54.480 --> 18:56.269
Without your bat,

18:56.269 --> 18:58.203
you're just a
defrosted gymnast!

18:58.270 --> 18:59.772
Eat grenades, Harley!

18:59.839 --> 19:00.907
Take that!

19:00.974 --> 19:02.541
-[laughs]
-[grunting]

19:05.813 --> 19:08.515
I knew we should have
killed you from the start...

19:08.582 --> 19:10.250
[Harley Quinn]
Yeah, you really blew it.

19:10.717 --> 19:11.818
Over here.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.586
No stupid, over here!

19:13.653 --> 19:16.656
Oh, sorry you missed me,
fucking idiot.

19:16.722 --> 19:17.722
Over here.

19:17.758 --> 19:18.858
No. Oops!

19:18.925 --> 19:20.226
-No. Wrong way.
-[exclaims]

19:20.292 --> 19:22.328
Oh, you're so fucking stupid.

19:22.394 --> 19:23.596
[sighs in relief]

19:24.364 --> 19:25.464
[moaning]

19:25.531 --> 19:26.566
[gurgling]

19:30.270 --> 19:31.270
[men groan]

19:31.270 --> 19:32.006
Hey Harley, are you--

19:32.006 --> 19:33.306
Ooh, yikes.

19:33.306 --> 19:35.407
It's about to get
way more "yikes."

19:35.474 --> 19:36.643
Ahhh!

19:36.710 --> 19:37.944
[death sigh]

19:38.011 --> 19:40.711
Yeah, that was definitely
more "yikes."

19:41.000 --> 19:42.715
Can we go get coffee?

19:42.782 --> 19:44.496
Oh. Uh...

19:45.417 --> 19:47.420
I let the emotions get
the best of me earlier.

19:47.487 --> 19:48.587
This is a minor setback.

19:48.654 --> 19:50.200
Here's what we're gonna do.

19:50.200 --> 19:52.291
Go to your brother's house,
get his old scuba gear,

19:52.291 --> 19:54.294
we fish my badge
out of Gotham Harbor.

19:54.361 --> 19:59.332
Then, this right here...
the new GCPD headquarters.

19:59.332 --> 20:00.901
That's right.

20:00.901 --> 20:02.869
I'm still commissioner.
I'll start a new department.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.238
I can deputize you
right now, Barbara.

20:05.305 --> 20:06.906
We'll clean up
this city together...

20:06.973 --> 20:10.877
husband and wife cops.
An unbreakable bond.

20:10.912 --> 20:11.912
[Barbara] I want a divorce.

20:11.912 --> 20:12.912
[claps]

20:13.780 --> 20:14.949
It's all hopeless.

20:18.417 --> 20:20.621
Where are you, Batman?

20:20.686 --> 20:22.957
They put me on ice
and an hour later

20:23.022 --> 20:24.991
the goons crawl back
to the bosses?

20:25.058 --> 20:27.827
Harley, this might
come as a shock to you,

20:27.894 --> 20:30.631
so I wanna... I want to say it
as delicately as I can--

20:30.696 --> 20:32.465
You've been iced
for two months!

20:32.531 --> 20:34.034
-Two months?
-Nice work, Clay.

20:34.101 --> 20:35.836
Um... Well, we've been
we've been trying

20:35.903 --> 20:37.336
to break you out
the whole time.

20:37.403 --> 20:38.739
And hell, I got shot twice.

20:38.806 --> 20:39.940
I never got shot,

20:40.007 --> 20:41.575
but I did put a lot of

20:41.642 --> 20:44.678
personal projects aside
trying to save you.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.038
I never realized

20:46.038 --> 20:48.347
how much we relied
on your leadership before.

20:48.414 --> 20:49.615
I mean, I don't want to say

20:49.682 --> 20:51.818
things were a disaster
in your absence,

20:51.884 --> 20:53.921
but they weren't
not a disaster.

20:53.988 --> 20:55.555
In fact, things got so dire

20:55.622 --> 20:56.957
we finally got
desperate enough

20:57.023 --> 20:59.492
to try the talking block
of mud's stupid plan.

20:59.558 --> 21:01.662
Which was a rousing success!

21:01.662 --> 21:02.962
Thank you very much.
[chuckles]

21:02.962 --> 21:04.865
You see,
usually penguin only hires

21:04.932 --> 21:06.732
the most distinguished waiters.

21:06.799 --> 21:08.001
Which is why
I had to develop

21:08.067 --> 21:09.635
my Francois character.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.403
[enthusiastically]
He was born...

21:11.403 --> 21:12.404
to a scullery maid--

21:12.471 --> 21:13.906
Okay, thank you!

21:13.906 --> 21:15.642
So, in the last two months,
did I miss anything

21:15.642 --> 21:17.845
other than Clayface's
long-winded backstories?

21:17.911 --> 21:19.046
Harley, just come with me.

21:20.814 --> 21:22.763
[door creaks]

21:25.919 --> 21:28.555
So after the goons
fell back in line,

21:28.622 --> 21:31.391
the Injustice League
carved up the city.

21:31.458 --> 21:33.359
They call it new New Gotham.

21:33.425 --> 21:38.425
Which is...
I mean, I can't even...

21:39.566 --> 21:41.401
[Two-Face]
<i>If you just played the game</i>

21:41.401 --> 21:43.002
<i>you wouldn't have</i>
<i>ended up like this.</i> [laughs]

21:43.002 --> 21:45.005
[Mr. Freeze]
<i>You did this to yourself.</i>

21:45.071 --> 21:47.740
[Bane mumbling]

21:47.807 --> 21:50.044
[Riddler]
Who's the biggest fool of all?

21:50.044 --> 21:51.045
<i>You!</i>

21:52.913 --> 21:54.548
You were right all along, Ive.

21:54.614 --> 21:56.750
I shoulda taken control
from the start.

21:56.817 --> 21:59.819
Riddler, Two-Face,
Freeze, Bane.

21:59.886 --> 22:01.387
I'm taking 'em all down.

22:02.088 --> 22:03.089
And when I'm done,

22:03.156 --> 22:05.424
Gotham is gonna be...

22:05.491 --> 22:06.625
mine!

22:06.692 --> 22:08.428
[thunderclap]

22:09.028 --> 22:11.631
[Poison Ivy] Cool.

22:11.698 --> 22:13.799
[male nurse] Yeah. We pulled
him from the Joker Tower
rubble months ago.

22:13.799 --> 22:15.068
He's been in a coma ever since.

22:15.134 --> 22:16.670
The swelling
should've gone down.

22:16.737 --> 22:18.538
Let me just...

22:18.605 --> 22:19.839
-Oh, my God.
-[gasps]

22:19.906 --> 22:21.441
It's... Bruce Wayne.

22:23.509 --> 22:24.678
[theme music playing]
