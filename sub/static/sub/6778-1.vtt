05:49.480 --> 05:51.505

06:08.500 --> 06:11.469
I WASN'T GONNA
SAY ANYTHING.

06:15.340 --> 06:17.001
WELL, I GUESS
I BETTER GET GOING.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.964
YOU COULD STAY

06:19.070 --> 06:20.230
IF YOU WANT.

06:20.340 --> 06:21.568
HERE ?

06:21.680 --> 06:25.207
YEAH, IF YOU'RE TOO DRUNK
TO DRIVE OR WHATEVER.

06:25.310 --> 06:29.269
I GUESS I COULD

06:29.380 --> 06:31.610
AND WHAT'S WRONG WITH
"HERE," ANYWAY ?

06:31.720 --> 06:32.550

I GREW UP.

06:34.190 --> 06:35.487
NOTHING'S WRONG

06:35.590 --> 06:36.887
I'VE JUST NEVER STAYED

06:38.460 --> 06:40.121

A LITTLE EDGY.

06:45.900 --> 06:47.060
YOU CAN BE WHATEVER YOU WANT,
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT.

SO STAY OVER.

06:47.970 --> 06:48.868
OKAY !

06:51.310 --> 06:52.902

06:53.010 --> 06:58.107
I HAVE TO DRIVE

07:01.120 --> 07:03.418
TO PICK UP
MY WIFE'S BODY ?

07:03.520 --> 07:05.147
GO TO SLEEP.

07:07.390 --> 07:10.188
I CAN'T...

07:10.290 --> 07:14.397
IT'S ALL
SO IMPOSSIBLE.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.297
IT'S ALL SO
FUCKIN' IMPOSSIBLE.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.595
JUST SLEEP, NATE,
IT HELPS.

07:25.470 --> 07:27.609
IT'S WEIRD.

07:27.710 --> 07:30.201

07:30.310 --> 07:34.872

07:51.000 --> 07:52.467
I JUST GOT BLOWN

07:52.570 --> 07:55.630
WHERE MY MOM USED TO READ ME
"THE RUNAWAY BUNNY" ?

07:57.610 --> 08:00.534

CHINESE BROTHERS."

08:00.640 --> 08:02.847
( moaning )

08:02.950 --> 08:04.872

08:08.150 --> 08:09.344

08:09.450 --> 08:12.283
( laughing )

08:12.390 --> 08:14.551

08:34.410 --> 08:35.638
GEORGE !

08:35.740 --> 08:39.506

08:49.560 --> 08:51.118

08:51.230 --> 08:55.553
IT CERTAIN LY WAS.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.934
I'M MARRIED AGAIN.

09:06.170 --> 09:07.831
AND ?

09:07.940 --> 09:10.545

I'D BE MARRIED AGAIN.

09:10.650 --> 09:14.108
ARE YOU HAPPY ?

09:14.220 --> 09:16.176
VERY.

09:16.280 --> 09:19.147

09:21.260 --> 09:23.285
I'M SORRY YOUR CHILDREN
COULDN'T COME TO THE WEDDING.

09:23.390 --> 09:27.429
WELL, THEY WERE
VERY BUSY.

09:27.530 --> 09:29.691
I GET IT.

09:29.800 --> 09:33.099
I'D LIKE TO MEET THEM,
THOUGH, SOMETIME.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.462
BRIAN AND MAGGIE ?

09:34.570 --> 09:35.935
SURE.

09:36.040 --> 09:37.860
YOU KNOW SO MUCH
ABOUT MY FAMILY,

09:37.970 --> 09:39.733
AND I KNOW SO LITTLE
ABOUT YOURS.

09:39.840 --> 09:43.378
I'M SURE YOU'LL
MEET THEM SOMEDAY.

09:43.480 --> 09:47.143
AT MY FUNERAL,
IF NOT BEFORE.

09:47.250 --> 09:48.410
GEORGE !

09:48.520 --> 09:50.010
IF THEY EVEN BOTHER
TO COME TO THAT.

09:50.120 --> 09:52.714
GEORGE,
I'M SERIOUS.

09:59.060 --> 10:00.596
LOOK.

10:02.030 --> 10:04.419
YOU'VE LIVED
YOUR LIFE ONE WAY.

10:04.530 --> 10:07.169
I'VE LIVED
MINE ANOTHER.

10:07.270 --> 10:09.704
THE COSTS
ARE DIFFERENT.

10:09.810 --> 10:13.473
BUT I CAN
TELL YOU THIS,

10:13.580 --> 10:16.504
EVERY DAY
WHEN I WAKE UP,

10:16.610 --> 10:19.272
I'M GLAD THAT
I'M ALIVE,

10:19.380 --> 10:22.110
AND IF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE
THE WAY I'VE DONE THINGS,

10:22.220 --> 10:25.917
THAT'S THEIR BUSINESS.

10:29.390 --> 10:30.982
BUT RIGHT NOW,

10:31.090 --> 10:35.299
I'M SO VERY HAPPY
I'VE FOUND YOU,

10:35.400 --> 10:39.860
AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD,
NOT BACK.

10:40.900 --> 10:42.936
OKAY ?

10:52.750 --> 10:55.116
DO YOU THINK
WE WERE TOO LOUD ?

10:55.220 --> 11:01.659
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT
WE WERE TOO LOUD, YES.

11:01.760 --> 11:05.821
( giggling )

12:46.830 --> 12:50.425
( moaning )

14:06.240 --> 14:07.707
NATE.

14:07.810 --> 14:09.175
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SAY IT,

14:09.280 --> 14:12.340

14:38.440 --> 14:40.829

14:40.940 --> 14:42.532

SLEEP ANYWAY.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.744
COULD YOU
BELIEVE THAT ?

14:44.850 --> 14:46.306
I WAS LIKE COMPLETELY
SCANDALIZED.

14:46.410 --> 14:48.878
I NEVER KNEW THE WORD "GEORGE"
COULD SOUND SO OBSCENE.

14:48.980 --> 14:51.744
(giggling )
GOOD FOR THEM.

14:51.850 --> 14:54.887
YOU WANT SOME
MORE COFFEE ?

14:54.990 --> 14:57.220
YES, PLEASE.

15:04.330 --> 15:05.922
WE HAVE ALL GOT
TO GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE

15:06.030 --> 15:07.793
IF THEY'RE GONNA
KEEP DOING THAT.

15:07.900 --> 15:08.969
OUT OF THE STATE.

15:09.070 --> 15:11.630
OUT OF THE UNIVERSE.

15:11.740 --> 15:13.901
( laughing )

15:18.880 --> 15:20.768
( Claire )
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU ?

15:20.880 --> 15:23.019
LISA'S DEAD.

15:26.320 --> 15:27.412

15:27.520 --> 15:30.125
HER BODY WASHED UP NEAR
CARPINTERIA A FEW DAYS AGO.

15:31.030 --> 15:33.498
SOME KIDS FOUND IT.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.953
FUCK.

15:35.060 --> 15:37.563
IT TOOK THE LAB 'TIL YESTERDAY
TO FIGURE OUT IT WAS HER.

15:38.800 --> 15:40.529
DO THEY KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED ?

15:40.640 --> 15:41.959
SHE DROWNED.

15:42.070 --> 15:44.038
SHE JUST...
DROWNED ?

15:44.140 --> 15:45.437
( Nate )
THAT'S WHAT
THEY SAID.

15:45.540 --> 15:49.203
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE
OF ANYTHING ELSE... BAD.

15:49.310 --> 15:50.948
BUT SHE COULD
SWIM, RIGHT ?

15:51.050 --> 15:54.816
( Nate )
YEAH, JUST LOOKS
LIKE SHE DROWNED.

15:54.920 --> 15:58.117
GOD.

16:00.520 --> 16:04.388
SO I HAVE TO GO TO THE CORONER
UP THERE AND GET HER.

16:04.490 --> 16:05.855
I'LL COME WITH YOU.

16:05.960 --> 16:07.928

16:08.030 --> 16:10.590

16:25.280 --> 16:27.748
THEY FOUND
LISA'S BODY.

16:27.850 --> 16:30.910
SHE'S DEAD.

16:31.020 --> 16:33.454

THIS YOUNG GIRL...

17:12.460 --> 17:15.224
YOU DON'T EVEN
WANT TO KNOW.

17:17.130 --> 17:21.032
THANK YOU FOR TAKING
SUCH GOOD CARE OF US.

17:23.040 --> 17:25.463
ANGELICA,

17:35.420 --> 17:37.308

BACK TOGETHER ?

17:37.420 --> 17:39.081
NO.

17:39.190 --> 17:42.455
HE WAS THERE
THIS MORNING.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.619
HE WAS A LITTLE DRUNK
LAST NIGHT,

17:44.730 --> 17:45.879
I LET HIM STAY OVER.

17:45.990 --> 17:46.979
I WAS BEING POLITE.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.694
POLITE AND HORNY.

17:49.800 --> 17:52.519
AND HORNY.

17:52.630 --> 17:55.838
THANK YOU FOR
BRINGING THAT UP.

18:01.640 --> 18:04.541
I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT LISA
AND I'D BE TOGETHER FOREVER.

18:04.650 --> 18:09.440
I ALWAYS KNEW SOMETHING
WOULD COME ALONG AND END IT.

18:13.360 --> 18:16.181
I JUST DIDN'T
WANT IT TO BE ME.

18:16.290 --> 18:18.520
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE HOW
MUCH TIME I WASTED THINKING,

18:18.630 --> 18:20.598
"PLEASE DON'T LET IT
BE ME THAT FUCKS IT UP."

18:20.700 --> 18:21.997
AND IT WASN'T.

18:22.100 --> 18:23.567
NO.

18:23.670 --> 18:26.264
GOOD FOR ME.

18:27.740 --> 18:31.164
YOU SMELL TERRIBLE.

18:31.270 --> 18:33.101
( Nate )
CAVITY FLUID,
SORRY.

18:33.210 --> 18:35.428
THE SMELL OF IT JUST
PERMEATES EVERYTHING.

18:35.540 --> 18:38.179
IT ALWAYS SMELLS
SO COLD AND LONELY.

18:38.280 --> 18:40.919
AND THEN ALSO WEIRDLY SWEET,
LIKE AN OLD LADY'S HAIR.

18:41.020 --> 18:42.544
THAT'S VELVETONE.

18:42.650 --> 18:44.618
MOISTU RIZER.

18:44.720 --> 18:48.451
TO MASK
THE OTHER SMELL.

18:52.690 --> 18:55.693
I'LL TAKE A SHOWER
BEFORE I COME TO BED.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.358
WHEN I DIE, I DON'T WANT
ANY OF THAT STUFF IN ME.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.119
YEAH, I DON'T
BLAME YOU.

18:59.230 --> 19:00.629
NO, I'M SERIOUS.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.662
I DON'T WANT TO BE
CHEMICALIZED AND BOXED UP.

19:02.770 --> 19:05.330
I JUST WANT TO BE TAKEN OUT
TO SOME OPEN SPACE,

19:05.440 --> 19:07.408
IN THE FOREST SOMEWHERE,

19:07.510 --> 19:09.501
BURIED RIGHT
IN THE GROUND.

19:09.610 --> 19:12.147
NOTHING BETWEEN ME
AND THE EARTH THAT MADE ME.

19:12.250 --> 19:14.514
YOU DON'T WANT
TO END UP IN A GRAVEYARD.

19:14.620 --> 19:17.680
NATE, THE WHOLE WORLD'S
A GRAVEYARD.

19:25.030 --> 19:26.019
( knocking )

19:26.130 --> 19:27.427
( male )
ANYBODY HOME ?

19:27.530 --> 19:28.849
HELLO ?

19:28.960 --> 19:30.120
IT'S JOE.

19:30.230 --> 19:31.663
FROM ACROSS
THE WAY ?

19:31.770 --> 19:33.988
THE GUY THAT YOU DIDN'T GO
ON A DATE WITH LAST NIGHT ?

19:34.100 --> 19:37.137
OH, HI, YEAH.

19:37.240 --> 19:39.731
COME ON IN.

19:42.680 --> 19:43.442
HEY.

19:43.550 --> 19:45.006
HEY, WHAT'S
IN THE BAG ?

19:45.110 --> 19:48.113
ARE YOU OKAY ?

19:48.220 --> 19:50.142
YEAH, I'M ALRIGHT,
I GUESS.

19:50.250 --> 19:53.310
WELL, WHAT'S
THE MATTER ?

19:53.420 --> 19:57.754
OH, A FRIEND
OF MINE DIED.

19:57.860 --> 19:59.885
OH GOD,
I'M SORRY.

19:59.990 --> 20:00.957
YEAH.

20:01.060 --> 20:01.958
I CAN GO IF YOU-

20:02.060 --> 20:03.698
NO, STAY.

20:03.800 --> 20:05.427
STAY.

20:05.530 --> 20:08.431
I'VE JUST BEEN SITTING HERE
STARING INTO SPACE ALL MORNING,

20:08.540 --> 20:11.065
I'VE GOT TO GET MY SHIT
TOGETHER AT SOME POINT.

20:11.170 --> 20:14.674
CHINESE FOOD ?

20:14.780 --> 20:16.031
UH, YEAH, YEAH.

20:16.140 --> 20:17.744
DO YOU WANT SOME ?

20:17.850 --> 20:20.171
I GOT A LITTLE EXTRA
JUST IN CASE YOU WERE AROUND.

20:20.280 --> 20:23.215
IT'S NOT
A DATE THING.

20:23.320 --> 20:27.359
IT'S JUST
A NEIGHBOR THING.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.555
ALRIGHT.

20:32.060 --> 20:32.822
YOU EAT SHRIMP ?

20:32.930 --> 20:34.295
MMM.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.119
THERE IS SOME SALT-AND-PEPPER
SHRIMP IN HERE SOMEWHERE.

20:37.230 --> 20:39.425
I EAT EVERYTHING
BUT MUSHROOMS.

20:39.530 --> 20:41.669
I DON'T LIKE
MUSHROOMS, EITHER.

20:41.770 --> 20:44.136
THEY'RE TOO MUCH LIKE
PARTS OF PEOPLE, AREN'T THEY ?

20:44.240 --> 20:45.935
THEY JUST TASTE
DIRTY TO ME.

20:46.040 --> 20:47.735
HERE.

20:47.840 --> 20:48.306
THAN KS.

20:48.410 --> 20:50.105
( chuckling )

20:50.210 --> 20:52.303
WHAT'S FUNNY ?

20:52.410 --> 20:54.446
I DON'T THINK I'VE
EVER HAD A NEIGHBOR

20:54.550 --> 20:56.677
WHO JUST
STOPS BY BEFORE.

20:56.780 --> 20:59.112
SO, HOW IS IT ?

20:59.220 --> 21:01.984
IT'S INTERESTING.

21:13.470 --> 21:15.358
I DON'T WANT
TO GO IN THERE.

21:15.470 --> 21:19.759
OKAY,
I'LL HANDLE IT.

21:19.870 --> 21:22.304
THAN KS.

21:25.350 --> 21:27.204
THIS WAS THE WORST ONE
I'VE HAD IN A LONG TIME.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.413
IT'S LIKE THOSE WHALES,
WHEN THEY DIE,

21:29.520 --> 21:31.044
YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENS ?

21:31.150 --> 21:32.287
NO.

21:32.390 --> 21:33.948
THEIR GUTS TURN TO CREAM
AND THEY EXPLODE.

21:34.060 --> 21:36.085
AND ALL THAT'S LEFT
WHEN THEY WASH UP ON SHORE

21:36.190 --> 21:37.919
IS A BIG BAG
OF BLUBBER--

21:38.030 --> 21:39.156
THIS IS
MY SISTER-IN-LAW.

21:39.260 --> 21:42.491
OH, SHIT, SHIT, SHIT,
I'M SORRY,

21:42.600 --> 21:43.999
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
HERE ON BUSINESS.

21:44.100 --> 21:45.021
IAM.

21:45.130 --> 21:46.666
AND THIS IS
MY SISTER-IN-LAW.

21:46.770 --> 21:48.328
AND YOU SHOULDN'T TALK
LIKE THAT ABOUT ANYBODY.

21:48.440 --> 21:49.964
OH, WAIT,
HOLD ON A SEC.

21:50.070 --> 21:50.934
WHAT ?

21:51.040 --> 21:52.109
THIS IS HER JAWBONE.

21:52.210 --> 21:55.407
THEY USED THE DENTAL
WORK TO I.D. HER.

21:57.750 --> 22:00.719
AND HERE'S YOUR
DEATH CERTIFICATE.

22:05.250 --> 22:06.979
I CAN HELP,
IF YOU WANT--

22:07.090 --> 22:08.717
I'VE GOT IT.

22:12.130 --> 22:13.825
I'M REALLY
SORRY, MAN.

22:13.930 --> 22:15.056
YOU DIDN'T KNOW.

22:15.160 --> 22:17.765
( doors slamming )

22:26.440 --> 22:28.328
I JUST NEED
TO DRIVE FOR A WHILE.

22:28.440 --> 22:30.032
THAT'S FINE.

22:32.380 --> 22:34.211
OH, GOD, JESUS.

22:34.320 --> 22:36.345
FUCK.

22:38.990 --> 22:42.209
OH GOD, LET'S GET

22:42.320 --> 22:44.424
( tires squealing )

22:54.040 --> 22:55.189
HEY, BARB.

22:55.300 --> 22:57.939
HI.

23:00.270 --> 23:01.806
I MISS HER SO MUCH.

23:01.910 --> 23:03.639
IT'S SO SCREWED UP.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.672
I KNOW.

23:10.150 --> 23:11.640
WHERE'S MAYA ?

23:11.750 --> 23:12.819
NAPPING.

23:12.920 --> 23:15.252
YOU GUYS HAVE TO COME UP
TO SANTA CRUZ TO THE FARM,

23:15.360 --> 23:17.282
SHE'LL HAVE A BLAST

23:17.390 --> 23:19.255
AND HOYT IS SO GREAT

23:22.600 --> 23:24.795

23:24.900 --> 23:26.219

23:31.970 --> 23:35.406

EVERY TIME THEY SEE YOU ?

23:35.510 --> 23:37.034
MMM-HMM.
MMM-HMM.

23:37.140 --> 23:38.676
SORRY.

23:38.780 --> 23:41.271
HOW WAS
THE FLIGHT ?

23:41.380 --> 23:44.417
VERY, VERY LONG.

23:44.520 --> 23:48.217
FLYING OVER THOSE MOUNTAINS
IS A LITTLE SCARY TO US.

23:48.320 --> 23:50.481
I TOOK A COUPLE
OF ATIVAN.

23:50.590 --> 23:54.651
BUT YOU
FOUND US OKAY ?

23:54.760 --> 23:56.819
ONCE YOU
GOT HERE, NO ?

23:56.930 --> 23:57.999
GOOD DIRECTIONS.

23:58.100 --> 23:59.226
NO PROBLEM.

23:59.330 --> 24:00.262
AND THE HOTEL ?

24:00.370 --> 24:01.462
EVERYTHING.

24:01.570 --> 24:04.004
THOSE WERE GOOD,
GOOD DIRECTIONS.

24:04.110 --> 24:05.429
LOVE THAT MAPQUEST.

24:05.540 --> 24:07.405
THAT'S A GOOD SITE.

24:07.510 --> 24:09.307
HELLUVA SITE.

24:09.410 --> 24:11.571
EXTREMELY HELPFUL.

24:11.680 --> 24:15.548
I'M STILL
A LITTLE SHAKEN UP.

24:15.650 --> 24:17.413
( Ruth )
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

24:17.520 --> 24:22.059
MY LITTLE GIRL
IS... DEAD.

24:29.530 --> 24:31.361
YOU WANT TO TAKE
A PEAK AT MAYA, MAYBE ?

24:31.470 --> 24:33.961
YEAH,
THAT'D BE GREAT.

24:38.410 --> 24:39.900
YOU'RE MICHAELA.

24:40.010 --> 24:41.329
IAM.

24:41.440 --> 24:44.307
I'M DAVID.

24:44.410 --> 24:46.173
I REMEMBER.

24:46.280 --> 24:47.747
I MET YOU
AT THE WEDDING.

24:47.850 --> 24:50.478
I'M SORRY ABOUT
YOUR AUNT LISA.

24:50.590 --> 24:53.184
WE'RE NOT GONNA
HAVE TO SEE HER...

24:53.290 --> 24:54.655
ARE WE ?

24:54.760 --> 24:56.216
NO.

24:56.320 --> 24:57.309
THAT'S A RELIEF.

24:57.420 --> 25:01.390
ARE YOU, UM...

25:01.500 --> 25:04.196
DO YOU THINK YOU
WANT SOMETHING TO EAT ?

25:04.300 --> 25:05.562
NOT ME.

25:05.670 --> 25:07.092
BUT I BET THE REST
OF 'EM DO.

25:07.200 --> 25:11.204
THEY ALL
LOVE TO EAT.

25:11.310 --> 25:13.870
I HAVE HAD THIS GOOFY FEELING
IN MY EAR FOR, LIKE, A WEEK NOW.

25:13.980 --> 25:17.472
I THINK IT STARTED
THE OTHER DAY, YOU KNOW,

25:17.580 --> 25:19.275
WHEN I TOOK THE BOYS
TO THE BEACH.

25:19.380 --> 25:22.349
ANGELICA ?

25:22.450 --> 25:23.678
WHAT ?

25:23.790 --> 25:26.543
I WAS WONDERING MAYBE
IF IT WASN'T TIME

25:26.650 --> 25:29.118
FOR YOU TO START
LOOKING FOR A NEW PLACE.

25:34.360 --> 25:36.157
IS HE MAKING
YOU DO THIS ?

25:36.260 --> 25:37.727
HE IS, ISN'T HE ?

25:37.830 --> 25:38.660
NO.

25:38.770 --> 25:39.998
YOU KNOW WHAT ?
THAT'S BULLSHIT.

25:40.100 --> 25:41.362
SERIOUSLY, DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S TIME THAT YOU GET

25:41.470 --> 25:42.960
ON YOUR OWN
TWO FEET A LITTLE ?

25:43.070 --> 25:44.606
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THERE

25:44.710 --> 25:45.802
WHENEVER YOU'VE
NEEDED ANYTHING.

25:45.910 --> 25:47.798
AND I'VE BEEN

25:47.910 --> 25:49.275
OH YEAH, WELL,

WHEN IT FITS FOR YOU,

25:49.380 --> 25:50.847
YOU'RE THERE
FOR ME, SHIT.

25:50.950 --> 25:53.100
WATCH YOUR MOUTH
IN FRONT OF MY KIDS.

25:53.210 --> 25:55.269
I'M SORRY, BUT THIS EAR THING
IS DRIVING ME CRAZY !

25:55.380 --> 25:57.940
ANGELICA--

25:58.050 --> 26:00.587
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT,
DON'T EVEN TALK TO ME, VANESSA.

26:00.690 --> 26:02.510
DON'T EVEN TALK.

26:02.620 --> 26:04.759
CONGRATULATIONS.

26:05.630 --> 26:08.952
I'M GONNA GO
PACK MY THINGS.

26:15.470 --> 26:17.097
( knocking )

26:17.200 --> 26:18.929
COME IN.

26:19.040 --> 26:21.804
CAN I ESCAPE IN HERE
FOR A SECOND ?

26:21.910 --> 26:24.003
SURE.

26:25.780 --> 26:27.270
THIS HOUSE IS CRAWLING
WITH PEOPLE,

26:27.380 --> 26:29.075
THERE'S NOWHERE
TO HIDE.

26:33.660 --> 26:34.752
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

26:34.860 --> 26:37.511
I'M TRYING TO BREAK
MY EYE OPEN.

26:37.630 --> 26:39.655
OUCH.

26:39.760 --> 26:41.694
THAT'S WHAT
OLIVIER CALLED IT.

26:41.800 --> 26:44.462
IT'S LEARNING TO SEE
THINGS DIFFERENTLY,

26:44.570 --> 26:46.765
WITHOUT ALL THE SAM E,
TIRED ASSOCIATIONS

26:46.870 --> 26:52.206
WE'VE HAD ALL OUR SAD LIVES,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

26:57.210 --> 26:58.700
THAT ONE'S
PRETTY COOL.

26:58.810 --> 27:01.847
YEAH, THAT ONE IS COOL,
THEY'RE ALL REALLY COOL,

27:01.950 --> 27:05.010

SO YOU'RE BACK TOGETHER
WITH KEITH, HUH ?

27:11.690 --> 27:15.729

27:15.830 --> 27:18.264
DO YOU WANNA BE ?

27:18.370 --> 27:19.997
HMM.

27:25.140 --> 27:28.075
WHAT I WANT IS...

27:31.010 --> 27:35.379
I THINK I COULD BE HAPPY
GOING BACK IF I COULD...

27:37.080 --> 27:40.186
BREAK YOUR EYE
OPEN A LITTLE.

27:40.290 --> 27:42.178
YEAH.

27:42.290 --> 27:44.349
IF WE BOTH COULD.

27:44.460 --> 27:46.223
WHY, IS IT THAT HARD ?

27:46.330 --> 27:48.321
YOU TELL ME.

27:48.430 --> 27:51.558
YEAH, IT'S THE HARDEST
FUCKIN' THING IN THE WORLD.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.365
YEAH, IT IS.

27:53.470 --> 27:55.495

27:56.870 --> 27:57.802
GOT A THING

27:57.910 --> 27:59.332
ARE YOU KIDDING ?

27:59.440 --> 28:01.635
EVERYONE IS AN ASSHOLE
WHO ULTIMATELY FUCKS YOU OVER.

28:01.740 --> 28:03.230
I AM TOTALLY
DONE WITH THAT.

28:03.340 --> 28:06.446
I'M THINKING ABOUT BECOMING
LIKE A CRAZY HERMIT RECLUSE.

28:06.550 --> 28:08.074
YOU WON'T ALWAYS
FEEL THAT WAY.

28:08.180 --> 28:09.545
YES, I WILL.

28:09.650 --> 28:11.015
( knocking )

28:11.120 --> 28:12.348

28:40.780 --> 28:42.975

LISA WANTED.

28:43.080 --> 28:44.616
WITH ALL DUE
RESPECT, NATE,

28:44.720 --> 28:46.881
YOU ONLY KNEW MY DAUGHTER
FOR A FEW YEARS.

28:46.990 --> 28:50.209
I THINK I HAVE A LITTLE
BETTER IDEA THAN YOU

28:50.320 --> 28:52.129
OF WHAT SHE WOULD
HAVE REALLY WANTED,

28:52.230 --> 28:53.822
IF SHE HADN'T BEEN
SO BUSY THROWING EVERYTHING

28:53.930 --> 28:55.921
IN MY FACE WITH
HER STRANGE IDEAS.

28:56.030 --> 28:57.019
MOM--

28:57.130 --> 28:58.324
NO, BARB !

28:58.430 --> 29:00.660
SHE'S GETTING CREMATED

29:00.770 --> 29:02.829
AND SHE IS GOING
IN THE FAMILY MAUSOLEUM

29:02.940 --> 29:05.363
IN COEUR D'ALENE,
THAT IS FINAL.

29:05.470 --> 29:08.234
PEG, AT TIMES
LIKE THESE--

29:08.340 --> 29:11.275
DAVID, THE KIMMELS HAVE
ALWAYS DONE IT THIS WAY.

29:11.380 --> 29:12.642

29:12.750 --> 29:16.641
WE'VE GOT A REAL NICE
SPACE SET ASIDE FOR HER.

29:16.750 --> 29:19.480
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
A LITTLE CHAPEL

29:19.590 --> 29:21.387
UNTO ITSELF UPON
THE HILL THERE.

29:21.490 --> 29:22.787
BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT SHE WANTED,

29:22.890 --> 29:24.357
DOES THAT MATTER
TO YOU PEOPLE AT ALL ?

29:24.460 --> 29:25.779
DID SHE HAVE A PLAN,

29:25.890 --> 29:27.585
OR A WILL OR SOMETHING
THAT WE COULD CONSULT ?

29:27.690 --> 29:29.453
OF COURSE
SHE DIDN'T.

29:29.560 --> 29:30.595
HONEY...

29:30.700 --> 29:32.167
SHE WANTED...
SHE DIDN'T WANT...

29:32.270 --> 29:33.464
WHAT ?

29:33.570 --> 29:34.537
SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO BE EMBALMED.

29:34.640 --> 29:35.538
SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO BE CREMATED.

29:35.640 --> 29:36.698
SHE JUST WANTED
TO BE PUT...

29:36.800 --> 29:39.462
BACK INTO
THE EARTH SOMEWHERE.

29:39.570 --> 29:41.834
NO CASKET,
NOTHING.

29:41.940 --> 29:46.104
WELL, THAT IS JUST THE SICKEST
THING I'VE EVER HEARD.

29:46.210 --> 29:47.916
MOM.

29:48.020 --> 29:53.788
TO BE EATEN
BY BUGS AND WORMS ?

29:53.890 --> 29:55.983
YEAH, WELL, YOU SHOULD
KNOW THAT A LOT OF HER

29:56.090 --> 29:58.581
ALREADY HAS BEEN EATEN,
BY SHARKS AND FISH, AND SHRIMP !

29:58.690 --> 29:59.588
NATE !

29:59.690 --> 30:00.679
STOP YELLING AT ME !

30:00.790 --> 30:01.996
TELL HIM
TO STOP YELLING !

30:02.100 --> 30:03.419
SHE JUST WANTED
TO RETURN TO THE EARTH,

30:03.530 --> 30:04.792
IS HOW SHE PUT IT.

30:04.900 --> 30:07.425
WELL, ASHES TO ASHES
AND DUST TO DUST, RIGHT ?

30:07.530 --> 30:09.566
SEEMS PRETTY
CLEAR TO ME.

30:09.670 --> 30:11.809
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO HONOR

30:11.910 --> 30:13.434
YOUR DAUGHTER'S
WISHES ABOUT THIS !

30:13.540 --> 30:14.438
IT SEEMS TO ME...

30:14.540 --> 30:15.973
WHAT ?

30:16.080 --> 30:19.106
I THINK WE ALL NEED
TO BE A LITTLE MORE AWARE

30:19.210 --> 30:21.417
OF EACH OTHER'S
GRIEF RIGHT NOW...

30:21.520 --> 30:23.272
AND A LITTLE
LESS AGGRESSIVE.

30:23.380 --> 30:27.441
IT WOULD BE NICE
TO DO SOMETHING

30:27.550 --> 30:30.212
THAT BEARS SOME RELATION
TO WHAT LISA WOULD HAVE WANTED.

30:30.320 --> 30:31.480
THANK YOU.

30:31.590 --> 30:35.822
BUT IF THAT'S
NOT POSSIBLE--

30:35.930 --> 30:37.864
I'M SORRY, I CAN'T
DEAL WITH THIS.

30:37.970 --> 30:40.530
DAVID, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS.

30:45.640 --> 30:47.665
UM...

30:47.770 --> 30:50.477
WHY NOT...

30:50.580 --> 30:53.549
( Peg )
WHY NOT WHAT,
DAVID ?

30:53.650 --> 30:55.777
LET'S ALL START...

30:55.880 --> 30:57.518
TO TRY...

30:57.620 --> 30:59.281
THINKING IN TERMS OF...

30:59.390 --> 31:01.585
MIDDLE GROUND.

31:02.590 --> 31:03.784
( phone ringing )

31:03.890 --> 31:04.959
YEAH.

31:05.060 --> 31:07.858
HEY, IT'S ME.

31:10.500 --> 31:12.491
HEY.

31:12.600 --> 31:15.535
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

31:15.640 --> 31:17.790
NOT MUCH.

31:17.910 --> 31:21.835
OR A FUCKIN' LOT,
I GUESS.

31:21.940 --> 31:25.341
WHERE ARE YOU,
CAN YOU TALK A SECOND ?

31:25.450 --> 31:26.542
Sure.

31:26.650 --> 31:27.844
YEAH.

31:27.950 --> 31:29.269
I WAS JUST ON MY WAY
TO GRAB COFFEE WITH THESE

31:29.380 --> 31:32.315
TWO ABSOLUTE IDIOTS WHO
THINK THEY'RE REVOLUTIONARIES,

31:32.420 --> 31:34.752
BECAUSE THEY JUST WENT
TO THEIR FIRST FLASH MOB.

31:34.860 --> 31:38.557
So the later I am,
the better.

31:42.200 --> 31:45.169
SAY SOMETHING,
SPEAK.

31:47.570 --> 31:49.162
WELL, UM...

31:50.770 --> 31:52.931
YOU KNOW,
MY SISTER-IN-LAW, LISA,

31:53.040 --> 31:55.929
she was missing for, like,
a really long time.

31:57.010 --> 31:58.375
They just
found her body.

31:58.980 --> 32:00.743
She's dead.

32:00.850 --> 32:03.614
HOLY FUCKIN' SHIT,
CLAIRE.

32:03.720 --> 32:05.244
YEAH.

32:05.350 --> 32:07.955
IT'S REALLY FUCKED UP,
ISN'T IT ?

32:08.060 --> 32:11.427
Claire,
I'm so sorry.

32:13.790 --> 32:15.428
YEAH.

32:17.760 --> 32:18.966
NATE, SHE'S
THEIR LITTLE GIRL.

32:19.070 --> 32:20.321
IF SOMETHING
HAPPENED TO MAYA,

32:20.430 --> 32:21.966
DON'T YOU THINK YOU'D BE
A NIGHTMARE TO DEAL WITH ?

32:22.070 --> 32:23.230
OH GOD, DAVID.

32:23.340 --> 32:24.432
THAT'S NOT THE FUCKING POINT
AND YOU KNOW IT.

32:24.540 --> 32:25.962
IT'S THEIR LAST CHANCE
TO BE HER PARENTS.

32:26.070 --> 32:26.934
YEAH, WELL, I'M HER HUSBAND,
SO THE FUCK WHAT ?!

32:27.040 --> 32:28.337
SHOULD I,
PERHAPS, LEAVE ?

32:28.440 --> 32:29.270
NO!

32:29.380 --> 32:30.608
LOOK, YOU KNOW
I'M WITH YOU ON THIS.

32:30.710 --> 32:32.109
WELL, I'M SORRY,

32:32.210 --> 32:33.199
BUT THAT DOESN'T SEEM
PAINFULLY FUCKIN' OBVIOUS !

32:33.310 --> 32:34.413
THAT'S BECAUSE,
YOU ASSHOLE,

32:34.520 --> 32:35.646
I'M TRYING TO KEEP
EVERYBODY HAPPY !

32:35.750 --> 32:36.739
WELL, IT'S WORKING !

32:36.850 --> 32:37.987
I KNOW IT'S
NOT WORKING !

32:38.090 --> 32:39.910
I THINK I COULD
GO RE-ALPHABETIZE

32:40.020 --> 32:41.578
THOSE UNCLAIMED CREMAINS
WHILE YOU GUYS--

32:41.690 --> 32:42.987
ARTHUR !

32:43.090 --> 32:46.321
OR I CAN DO THAT LATER,
ALSO IS GOOD FOR ME TOO.

32:46.430 --> 32:49.149
HONESTLY,
YOU JUST TELL ME,

32:49.260 --> 32:50.955
YOU THINK IT'S OKAY FOR
THAT FUCKIN' HYDRA, WHICH,

32:51.070 --> 32:53.163
INCIDENTALLY, WAS WHAT
LISA CALLED HER, OKAY.

32:53.270 --> 32:56.034
DO YOU THINK IT'S OKAY
FOR HER TO BURN MY WIFE UP

32:56.140 --> 32:57.459
IN AN OVEN AND
STICK HER IN A DRAWER ?

32:57.570 --> 32:59.231
WHEN ALL THAT LISA
WANTED WAS TO BE

32:59.340 --> 33:01.331
OUTSIDE SOMEWHERE
UNDER THE STARS ?

33:01.440 --> 33:03.829
NO, BUT WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING
IS AGAINST THE LAW, NATE.

33:03.940 --> 33:05.749
WE COULD LOSE
OUR LICENSE.

33:11.320 --> 33:12.514
LOOK.

33:12.620 --> 33:14.554
I KNOW YOU WANT TO DO
A GOOD THING FOR LISA.

33:14.660 --> 33:17.879
THEY DO TOO,
SO DO I.

33:17.990 --> 33:20.322
WE ALL WANT
TO DO A GOOD THING.

33:28.440 --> 33:29.862
I'M OVER HERE.

33:29.970 --> 33:31.506
WHAT CAN
I DO FOR YOU ?

33:31.610 --> 33:33.202
I'M LOOKING FOR
SOMEONE TO, UH...

33:33.310 --> 33:37.599
I WANTED TO MAKE
A CONFESSION.

33:37.710 --> 33:39.871
DO I KNOW YOU ?

33:39.980 --> 33:41.208
OH, NO, NO...

33:41.320 --> 33:43.345
I DIDN'T WANT TO GO
TO MY OWN CHURCH.

33:43.450 --> 33:45.042
OKAY.

33:45.150 --> 33:46.242
WELL, HAVE A SEAT.

33:46.350 --> 33:48.784
WE'RE NOT
GOING IN THERE ?

33:48.890 --> 33:51.222
WELL, WE CAN
IF YOU LIKE.

33:51.330 --> 33:54.356
BUT NOWADAYS, A LOT OF PEOPLE
PREFER TO DO IT FACE TO FACE.

33:57.060 --> 33:58.493
WELL...

34:00.830 --> 34:02.263
OKAY.

34:12.110 --> 34:14.840
I SAY EVERYTHING ELSE
THE SAME, RIGHT,

34:14.950 --> 34:16.110
LIKE, THE OFFICIAL WAY.

34:16.220 --> 34:18.415
YOU CAN SAY IT
HOWEVER YOU LIKE.

34:18.520 --> 34:21.648
OKAY, OKAY.

34:21.760 --> 34:26.254
UH WELL,
I'M MARRIED

34:26.360 --> 34:30.319
AND I HAVE TWO KIDS,
BUT THE OTHER NIGHT,

34:30.430 --> 34:33.126
I WENT TO A STRIP CLUB
CALLED THE SEVENTH VEIL ?

34:33.230 --> 34:37.291
I'M NOT REALLY
FAMILIAR WITH IT.

34:37.400 --> 34:43.339
OH, NEITHER WAS I,
BUT THIS GUY MADE ME GO,

34:43.440 --> 34:46.773
AND I MET THIS GIRL,
AND I LET HER GIVE ME A...

34:48.950 --> 34:51.043
YOU KNOW,
SHE, UH...

34:51.150 --> 34:54.153
SHE ORALLY...

34:54.260 --> 34:55.454
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THE SCRIPTURES SAY

34:55.560 --> 34:56.857
ABOUT THE SANCTITY
OF MARRIAGE ?

34:56.960 --> 34:58.222
YEAH, YEAH, KINDA,

34:58.330 --> 35:01.822
I KNOW THE BASIC POSITION
OF THE SCRIPTURES,

35:01.930 --> 35:05.661
AND WHATEVER, YEAH.

35:05.770 --> 35:07.089
GOOD.

35:07.200 --> 35:08.690
DO YOU KNOW
THE ACT OF CONTRITION ?

35:08.800 --> 35:10.438
YES, SIR, YES.

35:10.540 --> 35:12.428
OH MY GOD,

35:12.540 --> 35:15.236
I AM HEARTILY SORRY
FOR HAVING OFFENDED THEE,

35:15.340 --> 35:16.671
I DETEST
ALL MY SINS,

35:16.780 --> 35:19.271
BUT MOST OF ALL BECAUSE
THEY OFFEND THEE, MY GOD,

35:19.380 --> 35:21.371
WHO ART ALL GOOD AND
DESERVING OF ALL MY LOVE,

35:21.480 --> 35:23.072
I FIRMLY INTEND
TOONFESS MY SINS,

35:23.180 --> 35:25.785
DO PENANCE,
AND AMEND MY LIFE, AMEN.

35:25.890 --> 35:27.915
THAT WAS FAST.

35:28.020 --> 35:31.820
( phone ringing )

35:31.930 --> 35:32.851
( Nate )
Hello ?

35:32.960 --> 35:34.518
HI, IT'S ME.

35:36.930 --> 35:38.397
What's up ?

35:38.500 --> 35:42.561
I JUST WANTED TO KNOW WHEN
LISA'S FUNERAL IS GONNA BE.

35:45.640 --> 35:46.709
NATE ?

35:46.810 --> 35:49.278
YEAH, I'M HERE.

35:49.380 --> 35:52.076
IT'S TOMORROW,
10 O'CLOCK.

35:52.180 --> 35:53.704
DO YOU WANT ME
TO COME ?

35:53.810 --> 35:54.947
Uh...

35:55.050 --> 35:57.018
Honestly, no.

35:57.120 --> 35:58.382
OKAY.

35:58.490 --> 35:59.741
I MEAN, THERE'S A SHITLOAD
OF PEOPLE HERE, BRENDA,

35:59.850 --> 36:01.954
ALL KINDS OF LISA'S FAMILY
FROM IDAHO, IT'S A MESS.

36:02.060 --> 36:04.824
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO EXPLAIN.

36:06.860 --> 36:07.679
IS THAT ALRIGHT ?

36:07.790 --> 36:08.791
Sure.

36:08.900 --> 36:11.152
YOU DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO
TO GET THROUGH THIS.

36:12.930 --> 36:14.591
YEAH, I'M TRYING.

36:17.170 --> 36:18.660
THAN KS.

36:21.880 --> 36:23.802
OKAY, BYE.

36:25.580 --> 36:27.138
Bye.

36:27.250 --> 36:30.344
( dial tone )

36:37.290 --> 36:40.782
MY SISTER, LISA,
DIDN'T BELIEVE IN BORDERS.

36:40.890 --> 36:45.463
SHE DIDN'T SEE THE EDGES
AND THE LINES IN BETWEEN THINGS

36:45.570 --> 36:48.539
THAT MOST OF US THINK
KEEP LIFE MANAGEABLE.

36:48.640 --> 36:51.768
AND THIS MEANT IF YOU WERE
HER SISTER, GROWING UP,

36:51.870 --> 36:55.431
SHE WOULD ALWAYS COME INTO
YOUR ROOM WITHOUT KNOCKING.

36:55.540 --> 36:58.270
OR SHE WOULD COME
INTO THE BATHROOM

36:58.380 --> 36:59.745
AND OPEN
THE SHOWER CURTAIN

36:59.850 --> 37:02.341
JUST TO TELL YOU ABOUT
SOME ARTICLE SHE'D READ,

37:02.450 --> 37:05.419
OR SOME BOY SHE'D MET.

37:05.520 --> 37:08.250
AND IT MEANT,
LATER ON,

37:08.360 --> 37:10.817
THAT SHE WOULD...

37:10.920 --> 37:16.028
CALL ME ON THE PHONE SOMETIMES
VERY, VERY LATE AT NIGHT,

37:16.130 --> 37:21.659
JUST TO TELL ME ABOUT
A NEW RECIPE I NEEDED TO TRY,

37:21.770 --> 37:24.238
OR...

37:24.340 --> 37:28.879
MORE RECENTLY,
SOME NEW,

37:28.980 --> 37:32.040
COMPLETELY AMAZING THING

37:32.150 --> 37:33.879
THAT MAYA HAD DONE.

37:33.980 --> 37:37.541
OR ABOUT HOW WELL THINGS
WERE GOING WITH NATE.

37:40.490 --> 37:43.914
IT ALSO MEANT THAT
SHE LOOKED FOR WAYS

37:44.020 --> 37:48.354
EVERY DAY TO REACH OUT
TO THE PEOPLE AROUND HER,

37:48.460 --> 37:53.727
TO EXTEND KINDNESS TO STRANGERS
WHEN IT WASN'T EXPECTED

37:53.830 --> 37:58.301
AND TO PUSH EVERYONE
AROUND HER TO SEE THE THINGS

37:58.410 --> 38:01.265
THAT UNIFY US
WITH NATURE,

38:02.010 --> 38:03.602
WITH EACH OTHER,

38:07.180 --> 38:09.512
WITH LIFE ITSELF.

38:13.820 --> 38:15.515
LISA DIDN'T
BELIEVE IN BORDERS.

38:15.620 --> 38:18.657
AND THAT'S WHY I KNOW THAT
WHEREVER LISA IS RIGHT NOW...

38:20.190 --> 38:23.455
SHE'S EVERYWHERE.

38:27.670 --> 38:30.935
SHE'S EVERYWHERE,
AND THAT MEANS SHE'S HOME.

38:31.040 --> 38:38.344
( sobbing )

38:55.000 --> 38:56.149
SO, YOU READY, GUYS ?

38:56.260 --> 38:57.124
YEAH .YEAH.

38:57.230 --> 38:58.527
I GUESS.

38:58.630 --> 39:01.360
THIS WAS ONE OF AUNT LISA'S
FAVORITE SONGS.

39:01.470 --> 39:06.305
ONE, TWO,
TH REE, FOUR.

39:06.410 --> 39:10.870
* YOU...
WHO ARE ON THE ROAD *

39:10.980 --> 39:14.609
* MUST HAVE A CODE

39:14.720 --> 39:20.738
* THAT YOU CAN LIVE BY

39:20.850 --> 39:25.958
* AND SO
BECOME YOURSELVES *

39:26.060 --> 39:30.599
* BECAUSE THE PAST

39:30.700 --> 39:36.366
* IS JUST A GOODBYE...

39:36.470 --> 39:38.165
THAT WAS AN
AMAZING SERVICE, NATE.

39:38.270 --> 39:41.876
LISA WOULD
HAVE LOVED IT.

39:41.980 --> 39:44.642
WHERE IS SHE GONNA BE
BURIED OR SCATTERED OR...

39:44.750 --> 39:46.445
WE'RE GONNA
PUT HER ASHES

39:46.550 --> 39:48.245
IN THE FAMILY MAUSOLEUM
IN COEUR D'ALENE.

39:48.350 --> 39:49.669
OH GOOD.

39:49.780 --> 39:50.872
IDAHO, GOOD.

39:50.980 --> 39:52.948
SEE, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
SHE WAS FROM IDAHO.

39:53.050 --> 39:58.181
WE'VE LOST THREE FRIENDS
IN THE LAST MONTH OR SO,

39:58.290 --> 40:00.451
IT'S KINDA
TAKING A TOLL.

40:00.560 --> 40:02.357
OH, YOU POOR THING.

40:02.460 --> 40:04.621
AND WE'RE NOT EVEN
40 YET, YOU KNOW ?

40:04.730 --> 40:07.119
WHAT'S IT GONNA BE LIKE
WHEN WE'RE 50, OR 60 ?

40:07.230 --> 40:08.788
THERE'S SO MUCH DEATH.

40:08.900 --> 40:12.336
AND MAYA, WHAT IS
SHE GONNA DO,

40:12.440 --> 40:15.136
SHE'S NEVER GONNA
KNOW HER MOTHER...

40:15.240 --> 40:17.174
I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU DEAL WITH IT.

40:21.650 --> 40:23.174
THANKS FOR COMING.

40:23.280 --> 40:24.588
YEAH.

40:24.690 --> 40:27.215
I'M JUST SORRY
IT'S UNDER SUCH

40:27.320 --> 40:29.311
TOTALLY CRAPPY
CIRCUMSTANCES,

40:29.420 --> 40:33.356
BUT, IT'S SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

40:33.460 --> 40:37.999
WHAT HAVE YOU
BEEN UP TO ?

40:38.100 --> 40:40.762
NOT MUCH.

40:40.870 --> 40:43.259
MAKING BAD ART.

40:43.370 --> 40:46.032
SAYING STUPID THINGS.

40:46.140 --> 40:51.498
CONTINUING IMPLEMENTATION
OF MY MASTER PLAN

40:51.610 --> 40:54.875
TO BE COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN
WHEN I'M GONE,

40:54.980 --> 40:57.972
AND TOTALLY FORGETTABLE
WHILE I'M HERE.

41:01.990 --> 41:03.082
YOU ?

41:03.990 --> 41:05.480
NOT MUCH.

41:07.330 --> 41:09.525
I GOT AN ABORTION.

41:12.370 --> 41:13.769
WHEN ?

41:15.540 --> 41:18.532
LIKE, RIGHT AFTER
WE BROKE UP.

41:25.380 --> 41:26.540
SO, OKAY.

41:26.650 --> 41:28.914
YOU MEAN, DID YOU...

41:29.020 --> 41:33.389
JUST TELL ME THAT
WE GOT PREGNANT ?

41:33.490 --> 41:37.153
THAT YOU HAD AN ABORTION
AND IT WAS MINE ?

41:37.260 --> 41:40.127
OURS, YEAH.

41:43.600 --> 41:45.158
AND YOU DIDN'T
CALL ME ?

41:46.600 --> 41:49.330
YOU DIDN'T THINK YOU
SHOULD AT LEAST TELL ME ?

41:49.440 --> 41:51.294
I'M TELLING
YOU NOW.

41:51.400 --> 41:52.628
WHY ARE YOU
TELLING ME NOW

41:52.740 --> 41:53.900
WHEN THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO ABOUT IT ?

41:55.540 --> 41:57.576
BECAUSE
I'M LONELY.

41:58.950 --> 42:02.613
BECAUSE I NEED SOMEBODY
TO TALK TO ABOUT THIS.

42:03.920 --> 42:07.139
CLAIRE, I COULD'VE
BEEN THERE.

42:07.250 --> 42:08.558
I COULD'VE
DONE SOMETHING.

42:08.660 --> 42:12.050
RUSSELL, BELIEVE ME,
THERE'S NOTHING TO DO.

42:12.160 --> 42:13.354
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN
IF I'D BEEN THERE.

42:13.460 --> 42:14.381
LIKE WHAT ?

42:14.490 --> 42:16.219
I WASN'T GONNA
HAVE IT.

42:16.330 --> 42:17.592
I KNOW THAT.

42:25.570 --> 42:27.299
I COULD HAVE
COMFORTED YOU--

42:27.410 --> 42:29.275
WITH WHAT, FLOWERS ?

42:29.380 --> 42:30.438
BALLOONS ?

42:30.540 --> 42:32.269
BELIE ME YOU'D
ALREADY DONE ENOUGH.

42:32.380 --> 42:33.904
JESUS.

42:40.450 --> 42:41.542
LOOK, I'M SORRY THAT--

42:41.660 --> 42:43.412
JUST GIVE ME
A SECOND.

42:43.520 --> 42:44.885
OKAY, JUST...

42:48.160 --> 42:50.390
JUST GIVE ME A SECOND
TO GET USED TO THE IDEA

42:50.500 --> 42:54.163
OF LIVING WITH THIS
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

42:58.070 --> 42:59.162
ARE YOU FUCKIN'
KIDDING ME ?

42:59.270 --> 43:00.828
NO, I'M NOT !

43:00.940 --> 43:02.032
I'M NOT KIDDING YOU,
CLAIRE !

43:02.140 --> 43:03.607
IT'S FUCKING SAD !

43:03.710 --> 43:06.543
IT'S FUCKING SAD
AND IT'S FUCKED UP !

43:06.650 --> 43:07.776
I MEAN,
DID YOU CRY ?!

43:08.410 --> 43:09.718
DID YOU ?!

43:11.450 --> 43:15.056
I CRIED MORE THAN YOU HAVE
EVER CRIED IN YOUR WHOLE LIFE !

43:19.330 --> 43:20.957
THEN GIVE ME
ONE FUCKIN' SECOND

43:21.060 --> 43:23.199
TO FEEL BAD
ABOUT THIS, OKAY ?

43:23.300 --> 43:25.029
JUST A
MOTHERFUCKIN' SECOND ?

43:25.130 --> 43:27.360
IS EVERYTHING
ALRIGHT IN HERE ?

43:27.470 --> 43:29.131
YES, GEORGE,
WE'RE FINE.

43:29.240 --> 43:30.138
THANK YOU.

43:30.970 --> 43:33.837
OKAY, SORRY.

43:43.420 --> 43:45.684
DO YOU NEED ME TO COME
WITH YOU TO THE CREMATORIUM ?

43:45.790 --> 43:47.644
NO, THAN KS.

43:47.750 --> 43:50.913
IT'LL BE GOOD TO HAVE
SOME TIME ALONE.

43:51.020 --> 43:54.057
I COULD RUN BY
IN THE MORNING

43:54.160 --> 43:56.958
AND GET THE ASHES,
IT'S ON MY WAY, NATE.

43:57.060 --> 43:58.152
IT'S COOL.

43:59.270 --> 44:01.022
NO, THANKS, RICO,

44:01.130 --> 44:03.860
I TOLD THEM LISA'S FOLKS HAVE
TO LEAVE FIRST THING TOMORROW.

44:03.970 --> 44:05.858
THEY'LL DO IT
WHEN I GET THERE

44:05.970 --> 44:07.631
AND I'LL BRING
HER RIGHT BACK.

44:08.370 --> 44:09.803
ALRIGHT.

44:11.750 --> 44:14.639
( Rico )
I'M REALLY,
REALLY SORRY, NATE.

44:17.220 --> 44:18.244
THAN KS.

44:21.650 --> 44:23.413
WELL, I'M GONNA
GO STRAIGHT HOME.

44:24.690 --> 44:26.282
OKAY.

44:27.560 --> 44:30.051
SAY HI TO VAN ESSA
AND THE KIDS FOR ME.

44:30.160 --> 44:31.320
I WILL.

44:36.570 --> 44:38.060
SO I'LL SEE YOU
IN ABOUT AN HOUR ?

44:38.570 --> 44:39.901
YEAH.

44:54.820 --> 44:57.789
( honking )

44:59.390 --> 45:00.550
A lot you could
do with this,

45:00.660 --> 45:02.196
you could just take
a beautiful handkerchief

45:02.300 --> 45:04.097
and drape it over the top of it
and you'd be in business.

45:04.200 --> 45:05.269
Exactly.

45:07.500 --> 45:09.331
HEY.

45:09.440 --> 45:11.260
HI.

45:11.370 --> 45:13.167
NATE'S GONE ?

45:13.270 --> 45:15.374
YEAH.

45:24.120 --> 45:25.212
MMM.

45:29.660 --> 45:31.287
I HOPE THIS WHOLE
THING HELPS HIM...

45:33.060 --> 45:34.379
MOVE ON.

45:34.490 --> 45:36.993
IT PROBABLY WILL.

45:42.070 --> 45:45.005
IF I LOST YOU, KEITH,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO.

45:48.880 --> 45:51.132
YOU'D FIND
SOMEBODY ELSE.

45:54.450 --> 45:56.918
I DON'T WANT
ANYBODY ELSE.

45:59.320 --> 46:00.810
I REALLY DON'T.

46:01.590 --> 46:03.512
AND NEITHER DO I.

46:09.330 --> 46:10.558
THEN WHY DO WE... ?

46:10.660 --> 46:12.127
KEEP FUCKIN' IT UP ?

46:12.230 --> 46:13.458
YEAH.

46:13.570 --> 46:17.688
BECAUSE WE'RE HUMAN ?

46:17.800 --> 46:20.667
IF THERE WAS
A WAY TO START OVER.

46:20.770 --> 46:21.805
IF THERE WAS ACTUALLY
A WAY TO START OVER,

46:21.910 --> 46:23.878
I'D DO IT,
I REALLY WOULD...

46:23.980 --> 46:26.198
BUT IS THERE EVEN REALLY
A WAY TO START OVER ?

46:26.310 --> 46:27.299
REALLY ?

46:27.410 --> 46:28.843
JUST, EVEN
IN GENERAL... ?

46:28.950 --> 46:30.042
I DON'T KNOW.

46:30.150 --> 46:31.310
I MEAN, I WAS
TALKING TO CLAIRE,

46:31.420 --> 46:32.682
SHE'S TRYING TO SEE
IN THIS NEW WAY,

46:32.790 --> 46:34.883
YOU KNOW,
FOR HER ART.

46:37.720 --> 46:39.085
I DON'T KNOW
HOW IT HAPPENS.

46:39.190 --> 46:41.385
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE NEW
COMES FROM, YOU KNOW ?

46:41.490 --> 46:43.458
THE GENUINELY NEW.

46:49.540 --> 46:51.337
GOD, I DON'T.

46:51.440 --> 46:53.908
STAY WITH ME.

46:54.010 --> 46:56.069
MAYBE WE'LL
FIND OUT TOGETHER.

46:57.680 --> 47:00.706
THINGS WOULD REALLY HAVE
TO BE DIFFERENT, THOUGH, KEITH.

47:00.810 --> 47:02.038
I THINK SO TOO.

47:02.150 --> 47:05.517
I MEAN IT,
I CAN'T--

47:05.620 --> 47:08.851
I MEAN, I DON'T WANT TO SIT
THROUGH ANYMORE THERAPY.

47:08.960 --> 47:10.086
I DON'T EITHER.

47:10.190 --> 47:13.387
BUT... WE HAVE
TO LOOK FOR WAYS

47:13.490 --> 47:17.256
TO BRING THE GOOD THINGS
WE FEEL ABOUT EACH OTHER

47:17.360 --> 47:21.069
MORE INTO THE WAY THAT
WE GET THROUGH EACH DAY.

47:21.170 --> 47:23.832
SEE, THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE
LIKE THERAPY TO ME.

47:23.940 --> 47:24.964
WELL, IT'S CHEAPER.

47:25.070 --> 47:27.504
YEAH, AND IT'S TRUE,
I KNOW.

47:29.640 --> 47:31.676
I GOTTA QUIT MY JOB, THAT'S
THE ONE THING I GOTTA DO--

47:31.780 --> 47:32.940
I THINK YOU SHOULD.

47:33.050 --> 47:34.199
NO, I MEAN IT
THIS TIME.

47:34.310 --> 47:35.470
EVERYBODY IN SECURITY
IS A FUCKIN' ASSHOLE.

47:35.580 --> 47:36.478
THEN QUIT.

47:36.580 --> 47:38.047
I'M GONNA.

47:48.030 --> 47:49.224
SO DID WE JUST...

47:49.330 --> 47:51.059
WHAT DID WE JUST DO,
DID WE JUST GET MARRIED ?

47:51.160 --> 47:51.854
NO.

47:51.970 --> 47:52.925
IT SEEMS LIKE
WE KINDA DID.

47:53.030 --> 47:55.066
YEAH, WELL,
DON'T OVERTHINK IT.

47:59.310 --> 48:00.937
COME HERE.

48:09.920 --> 48:11.672
WHAT WERE YOU
JUST WATCHING ?

48:11.780 --> 48:13.008
WHEN I CAME IN.

48:14.850 --> 48:16.317
I HAVE NO
FUCKIN' IDEA.

48:16.420 --> 48:19.753
WELL, PUT IT BACK ON,
WHATEVER IT WAS.

48:19.860 --> 48:21.555
JUST SOMETHING.

48:28.900 --> 48:32.131
( male on tv)
Very, very cool,
isn't this great looking ?

48:33.810 --> 48:34.834
HEY.

48:34.940 --> 48:36.805
HEY.

48:36.910 --> 48:39.140
YOU MUST GO THROUGH A LOT OF
MONEY FEEDING ALL THESE CATS.

48:39.250 --> 48:41.901
ACTUALLY, I THINK
IT SAVES ME MONEY,

48:42.020 --> 48:43.476
IN THE LONG RUN.

48:43.580 --> 48:45.081
SEE, THIS WAY, I GET TO WALK
BY ALL THE HOMELESS PEOPLE

48:45.190 --> 48:46.282
AND THINK TO MYSELF,

48:46.390 --> 48:47.880
"YOU KNOW, I'D LOVE
TO HELP YOU OUT,

48:47.990 --> 48:50.049
BUT I TAKE CARE
OF CATS."

48:50.160 --> 48:51.752
YOU DON'T DO THAT.

48:51.860 --> 48:55.091
YEAH, I DO.

48:57.360 --> 48:59.362
THAT WAS NICE THE WAY YOU
DROPPED BY THE OTHER DAY.

48:59.470 --> 49:02.769
NO, THAT WAS SELFISH,
I JUST WANTED TO SEE YOU.

49:02.870 --> 49:04.565
WELL, I APPRECIATED IT.

49:04.670 --> 49:06.331
ANYTIME.

49:06.440 --> 49:07.600
LIKE TONIGHT ?

49:07.710 --> 49:09.473
I COULD BE FREE.

49:09.580 --> 49:11.207
SO COULD I.

49:14.550 --> 49:15.710
COME HERE.

49:29.830 --> 49:31.695
SO, WHAT DO YOU
WANNA DO ?

49:58.490 --> 50:00.788
HERE YOU GO.

50:00.890 --> 50:03.222
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING
YOU'VE DONE FOR US.

50:09.700 --> 50:12.032
THANK YOU, NATE.

50:12.140 --> 50:14.608
I'M SORRY THINGS
GOT SO COMPLICATED.

50:14.710 --> 50:17.372
I AM, TOO.

50:17.480 --> 50:20.472
WELL, THINGS HAVE A WAY
OF DOING THAT, THOUGH,

50:20.580 --> 50:22.571
DON'T THEY ?

50:22.680 --> 50:24.318
THEY DO.

50:30.520 --> 50:31.612
BYE.

50:36.430 --> 50:38.022
TAKE CARE.

50:44.970 --> 50:47.700
I'M GLAD YOU'RE
IN MY FAMILY.

50:47.810 --> 50:49.698
I'M GLAD
YOU'RE IN MINE.

50:56.150 --> 50:58.311
COME ON, GUYS.

51:03.120 --> 51:04.257
WATCH YOUR STEP,
THERE.

51:04.360 --> 51:05.679
OKAY, EVERYBODY IN.

51:13.370 --> 51:15.338
SO YOU'RE
GONNA GO ?

51:16.740 --> 51:18.492
YEAH.

51:20.070 --> 51:21.731
THERE'S STILL SOME
STUFF TO CLEAN UP

51:21.840 --> 51:23.705
DOWN IN THE BASEMENT,
THOUGH.

51:23.810 --> 51:25.346
I'LL TAKE
CARE OF IT.

51:26.780 --> 51:28.441
THAN KS.

54:56.290 --> 54:58.485
OH GOD.

55:00.130 --> 55:03.918

55:52.910 --> 55:56.846
AAAAAH!

55:56.950 --> 56:00.613
