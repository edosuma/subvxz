00:51.843 --> 00:54.179
<i>The fungi emit networks of mycelia</i>

00:54.262 --> 00:56.931
-<i>that go beyond ordinary cells.</i>

00:57.390 --> 00:59.976
<i>The university botanists
believed the trees are...</i>

01:26.461 --> 01:28.713
-Oh, my God, I'm sorry. What?

01:28.797 --> 01:30.173
Oh, right.

01:30.256 --> 01:32.842
Anyways, I was just saying that
I heard from Amy Volpintesta

01:32.926 --> 01:34.761
that Paul told Tim Hargreaves
that he loved me!

01:34.844 --> 01:36.096
So I texted him from
Lauren DiGangi's phone,

01:36.179 --> 01:37.514
and I was like,
"Do you actually love Robin?"

01:37.597 --> 01:41.392
-And before he could text me back--
-Robin, our planet is dying.

01:41.976 --> 01:43.186
Get your head in the game.

01:47.649 --> 01:50.401
I don't get it, Veronica. You're smart.

01:50.485 --> 01:54.155
You come from a good home,
but you have this... streak.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.156
Streak?

01:55.240 --> 01:59.702
You were my sunny straight-A girl,
all the way through eighth grade.

01:59.786 --> 02:02.914
Then you come back from summer break
with all these... buttons.

02:02.997 --> 02:05.750
All these causes. Your smile's gone.

02:05.875 --> 02:08.419
Your grades are terrible.
You're disruptive.

02:08.503 --> 02:09.879
What happened?

02:09.963 --> 02:11.840
I started paying attention.

02:11.923 --> 02:14.259
It's up to my generation
to save the Earth.

02:14.342 --> 02:18.721
Is that why you stood on a table at lunch
and called for an uprising against our...

02:19.472 --> 02:21.432
"school's war on climate"?

02:21.516 --> 02:23.476
I wasn't calling for an uprising.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.103
I was calling for a protest.

02:25.186 --> 02:27.355
-Of Hamburger Day.
-Yes.

02:27.438 --> 02:30.441
American schools serve
over a billion pounds of beef a year,

02:30.525 --> 02:35.071
which translates to a hundred million
tons of CO2 and methane emissions.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.573
I'm a high school principal.

02:36.656 --> 02:39.200
What am I supposed to do
about methane emissions?

02:39.284 --> 02:41.786
One person can make a difference.

02:42.829 --> 02:43.830
Maybe.

02:44.497 --> 02:49.711
That doesn't change the fact that
this makes nine infractions this year.

02:52.213 --> 02:53.298
Nine?

02:53.381 --> 02:55.216
You're suspended, Veronica.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.927
-Oh, what?
-Rules are rules.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.971
Students are allowed
four detentions per semester.

03:00.054 --> 03:02.599
-That works out to eight a year.
-There's gotta be

03:02.682 --> 03:04.809
some other form of punishment.

03:04.893 --> 03:06.728
Look, I get it.

03:06.811 --> 03:09.355
You did what you thought was right.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.649
You just did it the wrong way.

03:12.942 --> 03:14.861
Can't we at least talk about this?

03:14.944 --> 03:17.780
Don't make us out to be
the bad guys here, Veronica.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.574
We grew up in the '80s.

03:19.657 --> 03:23.745
Heck, I had a "Save the Whales" T-shirt
that I wore loud and proud.

03:23.828 --> 03:25.413
But we didn't let it affect our grades.

03:25.496 --> 03:27.290
And we certainly didn't make trouble

03:27.373 --> 03:28.833
-at school.
-I wasn't making trouble.

03:28.917 --> 03:31.794
-I was trying to educate people!
-Well, your teachers don't seem

03:31.878 --> 03:33.504
-to agree with that.
-Well, I'm trying to save the world.

03:33.588 --> 03:34.797
Enough!

03:39.510 --> 03:44.432
The world will still be here
when you get back.

03:44.515 --> 03:46.351
Miss Genevieve's.

03:46.434 --> 03:48.061
Comes highly recommended.

03:48.144 --> 03:49.562
VERONICA'
They have an impeccable track record.

03:49.646 --> 03:52.315
They specialize in girls like you.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.108
Girls like me?

03:54.192 --> 03:57.904
Oh, you know, uh, girls with a... streak.

03:58.863 --> 04:01.282
VERONICA'
We wanna see that pretty smile again.

04:01.366 --> 04:05.411
The girl we used to take to go
get frozen yogurt after soccer practice.

04:05.495 --> 04:08.206
The girl who used to snuggle us
on movie night.

04:09.457 --> 04:12.043
That girl was living in a fantasy world.

04:12.710 --> 04:14.796
Well, we miss her.

04:57.797 --> 05:00.300
<i>We don't often accept
girls this late in the year.</i>

05:00.383 --> 05:03.678
But your letter, oh, well,
how could I say no?

05:03.761 --> 05:06.431
You seem to have quite
the rabble-rouser on your hands.

05:06.514 --> 05:08.433
VERONICA'
She's a terrific girl, really.

05:08.516 --> 05:10.893
-She's just... complicated.
-Mm-hmm.

05:10.977 --> 05:13.104
Yes, I've seen
hundreds of complicated girls,

05:13.187 --> 05:15.732
all sent by loving families like yours.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.942
-I've never failed.
-So Miss...

05:18.026 --> 05:19.944
-May I call you Evelyn?
-You may not.

05:20.945 --> 05:23.656
Miss Genevieve, do you mind
my asking about the hair?

05:26.951 --> 05:30.872
We want our girls
focusing on studies, not style.

05:30.955 --> 05:34.208
Our hair is simply
an extension of our uniform.

05:34.292 --> 05:38.379
You see, the young mind is a sponge,
Mrs. Vanderhall.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.631
They come to us soaked in bad habits,

05:40.715 --> 05:44.552
and we just give them a little squeeze.

05:46.220 --> 05:47.972
Ms. Corbett, right on time.

05:48.056 --> 05:50.141
This is Heather Corbett,
your daughter's roommate.

05:50.224 --> 05:52.352
How do you do, Mr. and Mrs. Vanderhall?

05:56.147 --> 05:57.648
She's chewing gum.

05:59.025 --> 06:02.320
We don't permit chewing gum,
Ms. Vanderhall.

06:15.249 --> 06:17.293
VERONICA'
Veronica, take that off right now.

06:18.586 --> 06:21.047
-I am so sorry.
-Uh-uh.

06:21.130 --> 06:23.758
No need to apologize. It's all right.

06:23.841 --> 06:25.385
We see this all the time.

06:26.010 --> 06:27.970
Just a dirty sponge.

06:28.721 --> 06:31.224
Don't you worry.
The next time you see Veronica,

06:31.307 --> 06:34.477
she will be the model of perfect manners.

06:34.560 --> 06:35.686
I promise.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.875
-Ms. Corbett.
-Yes, headmistress?

06:57.959 --> 07:00.086
Show Ms. Vanderhall to her room.

07:00.169 --> 07:03.339
I'm going to call Mr. Welch
and schedule her hair appointment.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.882
Yes, headmistress.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.614
-May I help?

07:29.824 --> 07:32.535
No, you may not.

07:32.994 --> 07:36.247
-Don't you have somebody else to rat out?
-I'm afraid I don't follow.

07:36.330 --> 07:39.167
You turned me in for chewing gum.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.043
Well, rules are rules.

07:44.964 --> 07:48.468
Come on, you can drop the act,
it's just us.

07:48.551 --> 07:49.677
Act?

07:50.678 --> 07:51.554
Genevieve.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.097
Psycho, right?

07:54.307 --> 07:56.684
"You seem to have quite
the rabble-rouser on your hands."

07:56.767 --> 07:59.937
And the hair, what is up with the hair?

08:00.438 --> 08:01.689
It's a permanent.

08:01.772 --> 08:03.691
Mr. Welch gives them to all of us.

08:05.860 --> 08:08.237
Yeah, right.

08:14.076 --> 08:14.952
Hey!

08:15.036 --> 08:17.705
Music is strictly forbidden.

08:25.296 --> 08:27.757
We are gonna have such
a wonderful time together.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.133
Yay!

08:59.038 --> 09:00.122
Good morning!

09:00.206 --> 09:02.458
It looks like it's going to be
another beautiful day.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.426
-Good morning!

09:15.096 --> 09:16.222
Good morning.

09:33.447 --> 09:35.992
Good morning! Bacon or sausage?

09:36.617 --> 09:37.994
Do you have any vegan options?

09:38.077 --> 09:40.538
I'm sorry, I don't know what that means,

09:40.621 --> 09:42.623
but we're having cheeseburgers for lunch.

09:47.003 --> 09:50.840
These girls had no regard for the rules.

09:50.923 --> 09:52.842
They disobeyed their parents.

09:52.925 --> 09:56.012
They even accused them of wrongdoing.

09:56.637 --> 09:59.473
The people of Salem
dealt with these troublemakers

09:59.557 --> 10:01.642
by putting them on trial.

10:01.726 --> 10:05.813
Why, you could say that they were...
witching to get rid of them.

10:07.523 --> 10:11.569
-Fortunately, they never really care--
-Well, they weren't troublemakers.

10:11.652 --> 10:13.654
They were victims of oppression.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.573
The adults couldn't handle their reality,

10:15.656 --> 10:19.160
so they just dumped all of their problems
on a bunch of teenaged girls.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.663
It's all right, ladies.

10:22.747 --> 10:25.791
It's Ms. Vanderhall's first day.

10:26.292 --> 10:30.004
Why, she hasn't even had
her hair appointment yet.

10:35.051 --> 10:39.221
<i>Ms. Vanderhall, report to my office...</i>

10:39.805 --> 10:41.015
now.

10:54.570 --> 10:56.739
Ms. Vanderhall, this is Mr. Welch.

10:56.822 --> 11:00.117
He needs to take a few measurements
ahead of your hair appointment.

11:01.827 --> 11:03.829
-What's he doing?

11:05.873 --> 11:06.791
Age?

11:07.875 --> 11:09.251
What's that gotta do with my hair?

11:09.835 --> 11:11.921
Your age.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.133
-Fourteen.
-Mm.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.053
Get off!

11:22.723 --> 11:25.476
-Can you see her this evening?
-This evening, no.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.228
No, impossible.

11:27.311 --> 11:29.313
I am booked solid with touch-ups.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.482
MR.Next week at the earliest.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.698
I suppose I could squeeze her
in tomorrow night.

11:39.281 --> 11:40.282
Very well.

11:41.450 --> 11:43.411
Then tomorrow night it is.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.218
I wouldn't go that way.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.182
They patrol the roads.

12:48.309 --> 12:49.935
You're better off
cutting through the woods

12:50.019 --> 12:51.979
if you can get over the barbed wire.

12:54.774 --> 12:55.858
Claire.

13:00.362 --> 13:01.739
Veronica.

13:01.822 --> 13:02.865
I know.

13:04.492 --> 13:06.035
Come on, it's not safe here.

13:14.251 --> 13:15.711
Who's the girl?

13:15.795 --> 13:18.714
The last two girls got caught
before they made it to town.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.550
One on the road
and one by the perimeter fence.

13:22.051 --> 13:24.595
I tried to warn them. I have the patrols
timed down to the minute.

13:24.678 --> 13:26.180
And I can get you through the fence.

13:26.263 --> 13:28.766
I can help you,
but you don't have much time.

13:28.849 --> 13:30.100
What are you talking about?

13:30.184 --> 13:32.394
Your hair appointment's tomorrow night,
isn't it?

13:32.478 --> 13:34.104
Yeah. So?

13:36.232 --> 13:38.317
What is this place?

13:40.069 --> 13:41.195
I'll show you.

14:38.711 --> 14:42.047
Mr. Euvrard said
you were disruptive in class today.

14:42.756 --> 14:44.383
That's not like you.

14:44.466 --> 14:45.718
I didn't mean to be.

14:45.801 --> 14:46.844
It's just...

14:47.636 --> 14:49.346
I'm confused.

14:49.430 --> 14:51.432
I don't quite feel like myself.

14:51.515 --> 14:52.933
Aw.

14:53.017 --> 14:55.269
You just need a little touch-up.

14:56.312 --> 15:00.774
Don't worry, we'll have you
looking your best again in no time.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.360
What is this?

15:13.120 --> 15:14.788
Headmistress.

15:14.872 --> 15:15.831
Headmistress.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.958
Please, I'm, I'm scared.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.543
SALON GIRL Let me out!

15:20.502 --> 15:22.296
Oh, no.

15:22.379 --> 15:25.883
No. No. Please, please.
Headmistress, stop him.

15:28.802 --> 15:30.554
It doesn't work on me.

15:31.263 --> 15:33.432
I had a skateboarding accident
when I was little.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.769
Got a bunch of stitches
and a steel plate here.

15:38.187 --> 15:39.897
It must block it somehow.

15:48.447 --> 15:49.949
How do you feel?

15:52.409 --> 15:53.827
I feel...

15:55.663 --> 15:57.539
.
..wonderful.

16:00.250 --> 16:01.418
Good.

16:02.628 --> 16:03.712
We should go.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.317
Do our parents know?

16:25.401 --> 16:27.361
No, our parents don't know.

16:27.778 --> 16:29.571
But they don't question it either.

16:31.949 --> 16:34.159
They say they send us here

16:34.243 --> 16:37.329
'cause we're acting out,
or that we're troubled.

16:39.081 --> 16:42.042
I think they send us
'cause they're scared.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.129
They see us changing and growing up.

16:46.296 --> 16:50.384
We stopped hugging them,
talking to them, listening to them.

16:52.886 --> 16:54.346
Before I got here...

16:55.222 --> 16:59.268
my parents were the last people
on Earth I wanted to hear.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.647
And now, I'd give anything.

17:05.065 --> 17:06.316
Then why stay?

17:10.320 --> 17:12.781
<i>We were sent here together
at the beginning of the year.</i>

17:13.657 --> 17:16.618
Our parents thought it'd be easier
if we had each other.

17:18.370 --> 17:21.915
I remember the last time we talked,
me and Mary...

17:23.542 --> 17:25.753
like normal, like sisters.

17:26.545 --> 17:28.964
A couple nights later, she was...

17:32.176 --> 17:34.636
All of a sudden,
she wasn't my sister anymore.

17:35.971 --> 17:38.432
It was like she didn't even know
who I was.

17:41.143 --> 17:42.853
Before I could figure out
what was going on,

17:42.936 --> 17:46.398
they took me down there,
strapped me to that machine.

17:49.359 --> 17:52.112
Now, every day I sit at the same bench,

17:53.155 --> 17:55.616
watch her walk between classes,

17:56.825 --> 18:00.746
and every day she passes right by me.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.957
Sometimes she even looks right at me.

18:05.876 --> 18:07.086
It is not her.

18:08.504 --> 18:11.340
I'm her sister, I'm supposed
to protect her and I couldn't.

18:14.009 --> 18:15.177
Why don't...

18:16.136 --> 18:20.682
you just... take her and run,

18:20.766 --> 18:22.226
and tell somebody?

18:22.309 --> 18:25.646
Well, if I asked her to go,
she'd just turn me in to Genevieve.

18:27.439 --> 18:29.399
I'm not leaving without her.

18:30.734 --> 18:34.238
One way or another,
I'm gonna find a way to make it right.

18:39.785 --> 18:42.079
-The salon.
-What?

18:42.162 --> 18:45.165
If it takes away your personality,
maybe it could just give it back.

18:45.249 --> 18:46.750
Or it could just make her worse.

18:46.834 --> 18:49.253
What's worse than her not
even knowing who you are?

18:51.797 --> 18:53.715
It's a guard. This way.

19:18.448 --> 19:21.285
<i>Rise and shine, my beautiful girls.</i>

19:21.368 --> 19:23.996
<i>Let's have a magnificent day.</i>

19:33.046 --> 19:34.423
Ms. Vanderhall.

19:36.341 --> 19:39.261
Whistling is one of our no-nos.

19:40.220 --> 19:41.847
Of course, it is.

19:41.930 --> 19:43.223
Silly me.

19:44.057 --> 19:45.517
The little rebel.

19:46.476 --> 19:50.981
Oh, so much smarter than everyone else.

19:51.064 --> 19:52.524
So unique.

19:54.902 --> 19:57.738
Do you know how many times I've met you?

19:58.238 --> 19:59.448
Mm?

19:59.531 --> 20:04.703
A thousand defiant little brats,
like yourself, have come through my door.

20:06.538 --> 20:09.124
I've broken every last one of them.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.879
Come by my office tonight
at the supper bell.

20:15.005 --> 20:17.925
I'd like to take you to the salon myself.

20:32.522 --> 20:33.440
Claire?

20:34.191 --> 20:36.026
-Claire, are you in there?

20:36.109 --> 20:37.903
-Hello.
-Claire, thank God.

20:37.986 --> 20:40.030
Genevieve is gonna try
and fry my brain tonight.

20:40.113 --> 20:43.408
We... we have to get you and Mary
down there, like, now!

20:44.826 --> 20:47.120
Claire, hello? Did you hear me?

20:52.251 --> 20:53.418
Claire.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.588
What happened to you last night?

20:57.798 --> 21:00.801
Funny, I'm not exactly sure.

21:02.636 --> 21:08.100
I remember the guards
taking me to the headmistress.

21:09.434 --> 21:14.773
I remember Mr. Welch finding out
about that metal plate in my skull, and...

21:16.942 --> 21:21.363
then I remember feeling so clear,
all of a sudden.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.116
So wonderful.

21:33.083 --> 21:36.336
MISS GENEVIEVE
<i>Supper time, ladies. Don't be late.</i>

21:47.848 --> 21:49.391
Aren't you coming to supper?

21:57.899 --> 22:01.236
I used to be a happy kid, you know.

22:02.988 --> 22:06.825
Before I knew things
or before I understood

22:06.908 --> 22:08.285
what the world was really like.

22:10.287 --> 22:12.497
I used to think
it was a pretty great place.

22:21.673 --> 22:22.799
What's it like?

22:23.717 --> 22:27.429
Not worrying or caring about anything.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.389
Must be nice.

22:31.391 --> 22:33.560
Bet the world seems like
a pretty great place in there.

22:37.105 --> 22:39.566
Bet you were cool
before they sent you here.

22:39.649 --> 22:42.778
You have to be somewhat cool
to get into this place, right?

22:44.488 --> 22:46.031
Bet we would have been friends.

22:47.240 --> 22:49.368
We're going to be late for supper.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.208
I'm not going to supper.

22:59.878 --> 23:01.671
I'm going to my hair appointment.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.635
I wanna know what it's like to...

23:06.718 --> 23:08.762
think the world
is a pretty great place again.

23:21.483 --> 23:24.236
A little something to remember me by.

23:26.655 --> 23:29.950
I mean,
music is strictly forbidden, right?

23:40.627 --> 23:42.254
Heather, are you okay?

23:47.175 --> 23:50.220
No! No.

24:04.151 --> 24:05.235
Who are you?

24:08.113 --> 24:10.782
Wha... Why is my hair like this?

24:11.616 --> 24:13.952
Why am I wearing pink slippers?

24:14.035 --> 24:15.579
I hate pink!

24:16.371 --> 24:17.372
Hello?

24:17.456 --> 24:20.417
Are you even listening to me?
Whoever you are, I am freaking out!

24:20.500 --> 24:21.793
Heather.

24:21.877 --> 24:25.755
I... Heather, I swear,
I will explain everything to you.

24:25.839 --> 24:27.591
-But right now,

24:27.674 --> 24:29.092
I need you to listen.

24:34.222 --> 24:36.183
A little late, aren't we?

24:37.100 --> 24:39.311
I told you to report at the supper bell.

24:39.394 --> 24:40.645
Did you?

24:40.729 --> 24:43.273
Well, I wasn't really paying attention,
to be honest.

24:43.857 --> 24:45.609
Anyhoo, I'm here now.

24:45.692 --> 24:49.946
What do you say let's get this little
brainwashing party started, huh?

24:51.281 --> 24:52.782
Woo-hoo.

24:56.453 --> 24:59.915
You were sneaking around
with Ms. Driscoll last night.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.585
Wow, Evelyn.

25:03.919 --> 25:06.588
Your powers of deduction are incredible.

25:10.467 --> 25:11.843
That's all right.

25:15.180 --> 25:18.683
We'll shut that's smart little mouth
of yours for good.

25:21.645 --> 25:24.064
So how long have you been
using your little brain fogger, Evvy?

25:24.147 --> 25:25.482
Do you mind if I call you "Evvy"?

25:25.565 --> 25:28.026
Sorry, I don't actually care if you mind.

25:28.109 --> 25:31.029
Our parents, though,
they might mind if they found out.

25:31.112 --> 25:32.697
No parent has ever complained.

25:32.781 --> 25:34.950
They send you here sick,
we send you home better.

25:35.033 --> 25:36.535
Better? What?

25:36.618 --> 25:39.996
By making us dress the same
and act like your perfect little robots?

25:40.080 --> 25:42.707
If that's what you mean by "better",
I think I'll pass.

25:42.791 --> 25:46.419
-What a shame, you don't get to choose.
-Yeah, that's kind of my whole point.

25:46.503 --> 25:48.672
You don't care about making us better.

25:49.130 --> 25:51.383
You're just too scared
of what we have to say.

25:51.508 --> 25:53.093
You wanna know what I think?

25:53.176 --> 25:57.013
I think today's children are lazy,
disobedient, and full of themselves.

25:57.097 --> 26:00.016
And you are one of the worst cases
I've ever seen.

26:01.268 --> 26:02.602
What can I say?

26:03.311 --> 26:04.646
I've got a streak.

26:31.214 --> 26:32.465
What have you done?

26:32.549 --> 26:34.050
What have you done?

26:34.134 --> 26:36.720
-I gave them their voices back.

26:38.054 --> 26:39.097
No.

26:40.181 --> 26:41.141
No!

26:51.568 --> 26:52.569
Mary?

26:54.154 --> 26:55.614
Mary.

27:03.747 --> 27:05.498
Ladies, ladies. Ladies, stop.

27:05.582 --> 27:06.666
I said stop!

27:06.750 --> 27:08.752
Get... get back in! Ladies!
