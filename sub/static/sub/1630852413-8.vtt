WEBVTT

00:08.967 --> 00:09.926
Ana?

00:11.094 --> 00:12.137
Daniel!

00:12.679 --> 00:15.849
-How are you?
-Good. What brings you to Buenos Aires?

00:16.433 --> 00:18.560
I'm here for an event for my latest book.

00:18.643 --> 00:21.146
How many have you written? Sorry, but…

00:21.229 --> 00:22.689
No, don't worry.

00:22.772 --> 00:26.609
No offense. You never even liked
the poems I wrote you.

00:27.235 --> 00:29.779
Oh, hello. Sorry. I'm Cynthia. I'm…

00:30.405 --> 00:33.241
a big fan of your work,
especially Drifting Seas.

00:33.742 --> 00:37.203
Though I must admit
Shooting Star is a close second.

00:37.287 --> 00:40.165
Cynthia is my assistant and Daniel is…

00:40.999 --> 00:43.168
an old friend.

00:43.251 --> 00:44.169
Yes.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.963
Well, nice to meet you, Cynthia, and--

00:47.047 --> 00:47.922
Likewise.

00:48.006 --> 00:50.842
If you're not too busy
during your stay in Buenos Aires,

00:52.093 --> 00:53.470
come to my book event.

00:53.553 --> 00:56.598
-Oh, yes, I'd love to.
-We will be very, very busy,

00:56.681 --> 00:58.224
but thanks anyway.

00:59.309 --> 01:00.643
Oh, I have a meeting.

01:01.144 --> 01:04.564
But it was good seeing you.

01:04.647 --> 01:06.524
-You, too.
-All right, then…

01:07.692 --> 01:09.277
Good luck on your book event.

01:09.778 --> 01:10.987
Thanks.

01:12.322 --> 01:14.449
-How do you know him?
-He's my ex.

01:14.532 --> 01:16.034
I met him in college.

01:18.578 --> 01:21.289
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

02:18.096 --> 02:19.848
I don't think this will work.

02:22.308 --> 02:24.769
What? Our salaries are too high.

02:25.436 --> 02:28.356
Ana's recommendation doesn't mean
the investor will agree to it.

02:28.439 --> 02:30.358
What's with your negativity?

02:30.859 --> 02:32.861
It seems you don't want to get paid.

02:32.944 --> 02:35.864
I think we should test the waters first.

02:35.947 --> 02:37.490
See how it goes.

02:39.909 --> 02:41.744
What if she rejects us for being greedy?

02:41.828 --> 02:43.872
It may be a start-up,
but we need to get paid.

02:43.955 --> 02:47.208
Besides, let me remind you, you won't have

02:47.292 --> 02:49.878
ten roommates to help you
with rent the rest of your life.

02:49.961 --> 02:51.796
That's not how life works.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.841
Look who's talking,
you still live with your parents.

02:54.924 --> 02:56.968
For your information,
I'm apartment hunting.

02:57.051 --> 02:58.845
Stop. Stop fighting, okay?

02:59.512 --> 03:01.014
I'll check the budget again

03:01.097 --> 03:02.891
and email it to you before the meeting.

03:02.974 --> 03:05.310
Though remember,
Regina's diapers are expensive

03:05.393 --> 03:06.895
and we need to buy bottles.

03:16.279 --> 03:17.113
I've got to go.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.741
Hey, I was thinking,

03:19.824 --> 03:22.452
I could bring my stuff,
spend the night here

03:22.535 --> 03:24.662
and show you some tricks I've learned.

03:25.413 --> 03:29.292
Uh… I'm meeting some friends.
So, I might come home late.

03:29.375 --> 03:32.712
We can do it tomorrow.
I'll even drive you to the salon.

03:32.795 --> 03:34.214
I don't know, Anuar.

03:34.714 --> 03:37.342
I don't think I'm ready
for you to come live with me.

03:37.425 --> 03:40.178
Fine, but don't take too long.

03:40.261 --> 03:44.057
This handsome man
won't stay this sexy forever, huh?

03:58.905 --> 04:02.492
BOOK PRESENTATION - THE TIME IN YOUR HANDS

04:10.375 --> 04:11.209
Wait.

04:12.418 --> 04:13.753
I want to show you something.

04:14.337 --> 04:16.965
-Anything you want.
-Look.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.971
Aren't you scared it'll last forever?

04:23.054 --> 04:26.849
No… because this is forever.

04:44.534 --> 04:47.453
Could you connect me 
with Daniel Morales's room?

04:51.958 --> 04:54.711
-Mom?
-You left this really weird message.

04:54.794 --> 04:58.006
I saw you arguing
with Juan Carlos in Valle de Bravo.

04:58.089 --> 04:59.382
What was that about?

04:59.465 --> 05:00.717
Nothing important.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.761
I was only telling him I didn't agree

05:03.845 --> 05:07.181
with something he told me
about the business plan, but…

05:07.265 --> 05:08.766
Well, he seemed pretty upset.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.560
Maybe he was in a bad mood, beats me.

05:10.643 --> 05:13.229
-You didn't ask for money, did you?
-Of course not.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.941
-You always assume I ask people for money.
-All right. Don't get upset.

05:17.025 --> 05:19.652
No, Mariana.
What makes me upset is you never trust me.

05:19.736 --> 05:20.611
Okay, I'm sorry.

05:20.695 --> 05:22.905
I'm kind of busy.
I'll call you later, okay?

05:22.989 --> 05:24.032
Goodbye.

05:31.748 --> 05:32.582
She bought it.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.626
But I'm scared she'll go snooping around.

05:35.710 --> 05:38.338
I don't think so.
Especially not now you're with Anuar.

05:40.548 --> 05:41.591
What's wrong?

05:43.926 --> 05:46.846
Anuar is moving too fast,
and I'm not ready, Mom.

05:46.929 --> 05:47.930
Why not?

05:48.014 --> 05:50.224
I mean, it's not like you're 15.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.310
You're both adults.

05:57.273 --> 05:59.650
He's just so bad in bed, Mom.

06:00.234 --> 06:02.111
Just as I remembered.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.865
Not everything in life is about sex.

06:05.948 --> 06:07.617
Fine, it is. You're right.

06:08.201 --> 06:12.789
I could show you some tantric techniques
you could teach him.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.290
No, thanks. That's okay.

06:16.751 --> 06:17.627
Sweetie,

06:18.544 --> 06:20.338
I don't know why you're doing this,

06:20.421 --> 06:23.800
but if you're trying
to have a relationship with Anuar,

06:23.883 --> 06:27.178
you should give it your all, be all in.

06:28.721 --> 06:31.182
"Rosana was a woman who never settled.

06:31.974 --> 06:33.643
She knew moments like this

06:33.726 --> 06:37.063
inevitably slipped through her fingers.

06:37.146 --> 06:40.483
And she wasn't willing
to let them fly by."

06:43.611 --> 06:44.821
Am I Rosana?

06:45.321 --> 06:47.657
You're all my female characters.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.248
I love your smile.

06:56.707 --> 06:58.126
It's your best feature.

07:01.546 --> 07:03.131
Are you busy right now?

07:06.050 --> 07:10.012
It reminds me of the garden party
we crashed once. Remember?

07:10.096 --> 07:10.930
Of course.

07:11.013 --> 07:13.599
I remember thinking 
I could never hang on to you.

07:14.350 --> 07:15.226
Oh, really?

07:15.726 --> 07:16.561
Why?

07:17.145 --> 07:20.022
I saw how hard it would be
keeping up with you.

07:20.565 --> 07:24.527
You were applying for internships
while we were just freshmen at college.

07:25.987 --> 07:26.821
Right.

07:27.363 --> 07:30.241
Well, you weren't that far behind.

07:30.324 --> 07:32.827
You were always
attending writing lectures.

07:33.953 --> 07:35.329
Or writing about you.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.919
It's getting late. I have to go.

07:42.753 --> 07:45.131
-I have an early flight tomorrow.
-I understand.

07:46.090 --> 07:48.759
But we can't let a moment like this

07:49.844 --> 07:51.679
slip through our fingers.

08:08.654 --> 08:09.864
What's going on?

08:09.947 --> 08:14.327
Mariana saw us arguing in Valle de Bravo
and she's asking questions.

08:15.161 --> 08:17.121
I hope you didn't tell her about us.

08:17.205 --> 08:18.873
Of course not! Why would I?

08:18.956 --> 08:21.375
Teresa, no one
can find out we were lovers.

08:23.419 --> 08:27.006
I told her we were
discussing the business plan.

08:27.089 --> 08:29.258
So, if she asks, tell her the same, okay?

08:29.342 --> 08:32.053
All right.
If she asks, that's what I'll tell her.

08:39.977 --> 08:42.688
I want to give you something
before you leave.

08:44.106 --> 08:45.399
I wrote a dedication.

08:47.276 --> 08:48.277
Though…

08:49.070 --> 08:50.821
the entire book is about you.

08:54.784 --> 08:55.618
Goodbye.

09:04.043 --> 09:05.920
Shame on you.

09:06.003 --> 09:07.880
Watch your tone, I'm your mother.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.423
I told you, it's over.

09:09.507 --> 09:12.885
Besides, it's not my fault
Juan Carlos is Valentina's father.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.220
It's more like…

09:14.720 --> 09:16.681
fate slapping me in the face.

09:16.764 --> 09:19.976
Which wouldn't have happened
if you didn't date married men, Mom.

09:23.062 --> 09:24.146
Listen, you brat…

09:25.231 --> 09:28.276
my sex life is my business only.

09:28.359 --> 09:30.695
And I won't let you
come and judge me. Get it?

09:32.154 --> 09:33.447
Goddammit.

09:34.031 --> 09:35.741
What will I do about Ana now?

09:36.242 --> 09:39.120
I have to tell her the truth.
I can't hide this from her.

09:39.203 --> 09:40.830
Think before you do it.

09:41.414 --> 09:44.208
And consider the consequences,
because it's often better

09:44.292 --> 09:46.419
to leave the past where it belongs.

09:47.545 --> 09:48.546
In the past.

09:56.512 --> 09:57.680
Hi.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.851
Hey. When did you get here?

10:01.934 --> 10:02.935
Early in the morning.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.271
I couldn't sleep, so I went for a jog.

10:06.856 --> 10:07.857
Can we talk?

10:08.941 --> 10:09.775
Yes.

10:10.401 --> 10:12.820
So, you got caught up
in the heat of the moment.

10:13.654 --> 10:15.323
No, it's not that. It's just…

10:16.782 --> 10:18.659
it's been a while since I felt…

10:19.910 --> 10:20.953
admired.

10:21.037 --> 10:21.871
You know?

10:23.664 --> 10:25.291
What about Juan Carlos?

10:27.209 --> 10:28.502
I feel awful.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.882
The worst part is Juan Carlos
has never cheated on me.

10:34.258 --> 10:36.927
But when you've been married
for so long, well…

10:37.011 --> 10:39.555
You don't have to explain yourself.

10:40.097 --> 10:40.931
You know?

10:43.726 --> 10:45.269
I think I should tell him.

10:47.730 --> 10:50.775
Why don't you wait
until you've processed it?

10:53.569 --> 10:56.572
Sometimes it's better
to leave the past where it belongs.

10:57.865 --> 10:58.741
I don't know.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.913
All right, I'll jump in the shower.

11:10.294 --> 11:12.838
So, what did you want to talk about?

11:13.422 --> 11:14.674
Well, I've been thinking,

11:14.757 --> 11:17.551
maybe you could bring
some stuff over to my place.

11:18.052 --> 11:21.931
I don't know, that way 
we could spend more time together.

11:22.848 --> 11:24.141
Don't ask questions.

11:24.809 --> 11:27.812
Just tell me if you'd like to try this

11:28.312 --> 11:29.230
or not.

11:32.066 --> 11:36.153
I'll cook the best huevos rancheros
for you every morning.

11:36.987 --> 11:38.698
You won't regret this.

11:44.578 --> 11:45.871
My Tere…

12:23.409 --> 12:25.661
Nights in Buenos Aires are magical.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.080
Thanks for being
just the way you are… Daniel.

12:28.164 --> 12:29.248
Juan Carlos.

12:29.790 --> 12:31.876
-Look--
-Why do you have his book?

12:33.002 --> 12:35.087
Did you go through my stuff?

12:35.171 --> 12:36.922
Is that the best you can think of?

12:37.506 --> 12:39.592
It's Cynthia's. She lent it to me.

12:39.675 --> 12:41.844
I guess he wrote this for her too, huh?

12:41.927 --> 12:44.722
Want to call her and ask her?
It's hers, I borrowed it.

12:45.264 --> 12:48.225
-Are you reading your ex's book?
-What's wrong with that?

12:48.976 --> 12:49.810
Nothing.

12:54.815 --> 12:57.943
Oh! I don't think
the babies will like that green thing.

12:58.027 --> 12:58.903
Why not?

12:59.403 --> 13:02.239
You can't judge it
until you've tasted it. Come on.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.702
-Oh, it's not bad.
-Right?

13:06.786 --> 13:08.120
Yes.

13:08.204 --> 13:11.081
I can't help seeing Valentina
as my biological daughter.

13:11.165 --> 13:13.125
I feel the same with Regi.

13:13.209 --> 13:16.003
She's the baby I held
in that horrible delivery room.

13:16.086 --> 13:18.088
You know what this means, don't you?

13:19.715 --> 13:21.300
That you're eating their food.

13:21.383 --> 13:22.301
No.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.679
It means the baby is officially weaned.

13:28.098 --> 13:29.934
They're not ready yet, Mariana.

13:31.727 --> 13:33.229
They need us both.

13:34.688 --> 13:37.358
Besides, we don't know what could happen.

13:39.109 --> 13:41.195
It's important they can count on us both.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.245
Who wants some food?

13:53.791 --> 13:55.167
THE TIME IN YOUR HANDS

13:55.251 --> 13:56.710
What then? Rat out Teresa?

13:56.794 --> 13:58.420
There's nothing you can do.

13:58.921 --> 14:00.381
Just keep your mouth shut.

14:01.006 --> 14:03.425
Stop. Can you stop doing that please?

14:04.093 --> 14:04.969
All right.

14:05.469 --> 14:07.763
How am I supposed to see Ana every day

14:07.847 --> 14:10.724
knowing her husband
cheated on her with my mother?

14:11.308 --> 14:13.602
What's worse is seeing Juan Carlos

14:13.686 --> 14:17.523
and picturing them in my head,
you know, fucking.

14:19.024 --> 14:22.278
-It doesn't have to be that way.
-So, what do I do?

14:22.361 --> 14:25.531
Buy a tent and move to the garden
so I don't have to see them?

14:25.614 --> 14:27.032
Move out already.

14:27.116 --> 14:30.744
-Where would I go, Elena?
-Rent an apartment.

14:30.828 --> 14:31.829
With what money?

14:31.912 --> 14:35.499
I can barely afford
Regina's stuff with my savings.

14:35.583 --> 14:38.127
We're meeting 
the investor on Monday, right?

14:38.210 --> 14:41.672
So, let's put our foot down
and demand a big salary.

14:41.755 --> 14:44.258
Don't you think
it's too soon to talk about that?

14:44.884 --> 14:46.427
Pablo isn't on board yet.

14:46.510 --> 14:50.347
We'll look way more professional
if we come in with a big proposal,

14:50.431 --> 14:52.808
rather than having her think
we're three kids

14:52.892 --> 14:55.227
that have no idea what they're worth.

14:55.811 --> 14:57.771
Well, if you put it that way…

15:01.525 --> 15:03.903
Hello, I'm Mariana. Leave a message.

15:12.119 --> 15:14.163
-How are you doing?
-Hi.

15:14.246 --> 15:17.541
-Tell me, is it malignant?
-We're not sure yet.

15:17.625 --> 15:20.794
Little lumps in your breasts
aren't always bad news.

15:21.420 --> 15:24.048
You don't have to treat me
like your other patients.

15:24.548 --> 15:27.217
I've known you for years,
we trust each other.

15:29.762 --> 15:33.140
That trust is the reason
I'm telling you we need more tests.

15:33.223 --> 15:36.018
With the pregnancy,
breasts can have fibrocystic tissue,

15:36.101 --> 15:38.145
and you just had a baby.

15:38.228 --> 15:40.606
-So, that might be it.
-What if it's not?

15:41.482 --> 15:43.776
We should wait for the results, okay?

15:44.360 --> 15:46.862
And no looking up stuff online, okay?

15:46.946 --> 15:49.531
Can we lock down the trip, people?

15:49.615 --> 15:50.699
Yes, of course.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.618
Ana, do we have a date?

15:57.831 --> 15:58.999
-Ana?
-Yes?

15:59.875 --> 16:01.877
-Sorry.
-The date? For the Colombia trip.

16:03.087 --> 16:06.590
No. Next week I'm flying to Miami.
Could we do it on Friday?

16:07.091 --> 16:08.300
Friday's fine.

16:08.384 --> 16:09.343
Holy shit!

16:09.927 --> 16:10.803
Guess what?

16:10.886 --> 16:13.305
Camila Sodi walked out of the soap opera.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.559
Hey, I know everything you do
smells like roses,

16:17.643 --> 16:19.937
but it's better if I close this door.

16:20.020 --> 16:23.023
No! I'm claustrophobic.

16:23.107 --> 16:25.234
Don't close it. Besides, what?

16:25.317 --> 16:27.444
Aren't we supposed to be

16:27.528 --> 16:30.322
as open as we can
since we're in a relationship now?

16:30.906 --> 16:33.283
Maybe not this open, it's a bit gross.

16:36.370 --> 16:38.080
-Sorry!
-Busybody!

16:39.081 --> 16:42.751
I liked your app proposal
the minute I saw it.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.878
I think it has great potential.

16:44.962 --> 16:47.965
We want to create a community for women

16:48.048 --> 16:51.010
so they have
a safe space to talk about maternity--

16:51.093 --> 16:54.054
And an online shop
where you can find everything you need

16:54.138 --> 16:55.389
for your child and such.

16:55.472 --> 16:57.725
-Did you check the business plan?
-Yes.

16:57.808 --> 17:00.811
That's one of the things
I'd like to get into.

17:00.894 --> 17:03.564
I think this will be a very long meeting.

17:04.148 --> 17:07.276
Miss, can we please get the menu?

17:08.694 --> 17:10.529
I'm telling you, she's acting weird.

17:11.030 --> 17:14.116
Have you seen the date?
Ana was in Argentina those days.

17:15.743 --> 17:16.827
I'm sure they met.

17:19.788 --> 17:20.914
Do you think…?

17:23.459 --> 17:24.418
Do you think they…?

17:26.462 --> 17:28.213
-Do you think they're…?
-Lovers?

17:28.714 --> 17:30.132
That'd be great, right?

17:30.799 --> 17:32.259
Wouldn't you feel relieved?

17:32.843 --> 17:33.844
Relieved?

17:34.344 --> 17:36.221
Weren't you feeling guilty about Tere?

17:36.305 --> 17:37.723
That's completely different.

17:37.806 --> 17:40.893
No. Juanqui, you know I love you,
but don't fool yourself.

17:40.976 --> 17:42.978
It's the exact same situation.

17:43.645 --> 17:46.190
Besides, you're jumping to conclusions.

17:46.273 --> 17:47.691
Find out what happened.

17:48.275 --> 17:50.152
-How?
-Pay him a visit tomorrow.

17:50.235 --> 17:52.905
-Who?
-Daniel, he's in Mexico.

17:54.364 --> 17:55.991
Do you think they'll meet?

17:58.452 --> 18:00.412
Hey, you're being negative.

18:00.496 --> 18:03.123
We're just not charging as much as we want

18:03.207 --> 18:05.167
until the app is profitable, etc.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.169
Right, in like two or three years.

18:08.253 --> 18:09.463
I should get going.

18:10.631 --> 18:12.591
See you later, okay? To see Regina.

18:12.674 --> 18:13.509
Sure.

18:14.218 --> 18:15.052
See you.

18:15.552 --> 18:17.930
Now I'll never be able
to move out from Ana's.

18:18.013 --> 18:19.598
There's still plan B.

18:20.474 --> 18:23.310
Moving in together and splitting rent.

18:23.811 --> 18:25.771
It doesn't sound bad, but…

18:26.396 --> 18:27.231
Forget it.

18:27.856 --> 18:31.193
Mariana, that was the plan
before Valentina was born, well… Regina.

18:31.276 --> 18:34.321
That was the plan
when we were a couple or whatever

18:34.404 --> 18:36.949
and Pablo was out of the picture.

18:37.032 --> 18:40.244
Who cares about him?
Are you afraid he'll get jealous?

18:40.327 --> 18:42.538
I don't want to see you fighting all day.

18:43.330 --> 18:45.207
-Good point.
-So, what can I do?

18:46.375 --> 18:47.668
Come to my gig.

18:47.751 --> 18:49.503
Drugs always help you clear your mind.

18:49.586 --> 18:51.296
I can't do drugs, dummy.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.800
Bottled water at clubs
also helps clear the mind.

18:55.509 --> 18:56.885
I feel like a villain.

18:56.969 --> 19:00.764
I keep baiting him into fights,
but he's always adorable.

19:02.516 --> 19:04.601
He sounds like the perfect man.

19:05.310 --> 19:07.521
I know, I hate it.

19:08.188 --> 19:09.189
What do you hate?

19:09.940 --> 19:12.067
Being loved just the way you are?

19:12.818 --> 19:13.986
Oh, sweetie.

19:14.069 --> 19:17.156
Sometimes I feel
you like making your life complicated.

19:17.239 --> 19:18.949
-No, Mom, that's not it.
-Isn't it?

19:19.032 --> 19:23.078
I only let him move in because Mariana
won't stop asking about Juan Carlos--

19:23.162 --> 19:24.121
Wait.

19:24.663 --> 19:28.959
You always use Mariana
as an excuse for your decisions,

19:29.042 --> 19:30.586
but what do you want, Tere?

19:35.299 --> 19:36.133
I don't know.

19:36.967 --> 19:40.304
Anyway, tell me. Deep Blue or Passion Red?

19:40.804 --> 19:42.639
Passion Red always.

19:43.223 --> 19:44.141
I knew it.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.061
Holy crap.

19:48.729 --> 19:51.607
I just changed Regina's diaper,
what did you feed her?

19:52.107 --> 19:53.483
It's the baby food.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.152
Well, what's in it?

19:55.235 --> 19:58.197
The smell was horrible.
Worse than Conrado's farts.

19:59.448 --> 20:00.449
What are you doing?

20:01.366 --> 20:03.410
-Telemarketing?
-Yes.

20:03.493 --> 20:05.495
You really need the money, don't you?

20:05.579 --> 20:09.249
If it's for Regina,
I could find a way to chip in.

20:09.333 --> 20:10.918
No, that's not it.

20:11.001 --> 20:13.462
-I mean, not exactly.
-What is it, then?

20:13.545 --> 20:19.051
We'll have to move out of here soon
and I need to find a job to rent a place.

20:19.134 --> 20:20.928
Why don't you move in with me?

20:22.596 --> 20:24.306
-Really, Pablo?
-Yes.

20:24.389 --> 20:27.809
Do you really think
that's the right place to raise Regina?

20:28.352 --> 20:29.895
What's wrong with it? Why not?

20:30.812 --> 20:31.813
I don't know.

20:31.897 --> 20:37.486
Maybe it's the fact you live
in a Dumpster with four stoner guys.

20:38.195 --> 20:40.489
Hey, we don't party as much as we used to.

20:41.365 --> 20:44.201
In fact, come tomorrow
and see for yourself.

20:46.161 --> 20:48.580
I don't know.
I don't want to live with an ex.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.875
And I don't think 
it's fair to Elena, you know?

20:52.376 --> 20:54.211
You wouldn't be living with an ex.

20:54.711 --> 20:57.631
It would be living
with your daughter's dad who's a friend.

20:58.799 --> 20:59.967
Come on.

21:00.050 --> 21:01.927
You guys can have my room.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.471
Come on, Mariana.

21:05.472 --> 21:06.431
Here's an idea.

21:07.140 --> 21:08.058
Drop by tomorrow.

21:08.558 --> 21:10.269
If you hate it, just leave.

21:10.352 --> 21:11.937
Okay, fine.

21:12.020 --> 21:14.273
But we're not moving in for sure.

21:14.356 --> 21:15.274
Yes, all right.

21:15.357 --> 21:16.692
You're moving out?

21:16.775 --> 21:17.693
-Yes.
-No.

21:18.443 --> 21:19.278
No.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.197
It's not certain yet.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.449
So, please, don't say a word to Ana.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.953
No matter what happens,
we'll always be a family, okay?

21:42.884 --> 21:46.596
We have six hours
to make this place spotless for a baby.

21:46.680 --> 21:47.764
-Man.
-That's right.

21:47.848 --> 21:51.476
I want this place so clean
that I could eat off the floor, okay?

21:54.062 --> 21:55.439
You can do that already.

21:56.481 --> 21:58.358
-Yes.
-Damn right you can.

22:00.485 --> 22:01.737
You think I'm joking?

22:04.740 --> 22:08.535
-Fuck, that's gross.
-What did you eat, dude?

22:13.332 --> 22:15.250
Everyone, chill out, okay?

22:15.334 --> 22:16.877
Of course we'll help you.

22:16.960 --> 22:17.794
-Right?
-Hell yeah.

22:17.878 --> 22:19.588
-Yes.
-We'll do it for Regina, right?

22:19.671 --> 22:21.256
-Yes.
-Right, motherfuckers?

22:21.340 --> 22:22.632
-Yes!
-Hell yeah!

22:22.716 --> 22:25.010
-That's what I'm talking about!
-Yeah, man!

22:51.078 --> 22:51.912
Do it.

22:53.163 --> 22:56.083
I know this is painful for all of us.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.293
But we must do it.

22:59.044 --> 23:01.338
I promise you
Pancha's death won't be in vain.

23:02.089 --> 23:04.508
Chava, would you like to say some words?

23:06.968 --> 23:11.306
Panchu, I think I speak
for all of us when I say

23:11.390 --> 23:13.308
you taught us how to love,

23:13.392 --> 23:15.644
how to treat a lady right

23:16.269 --> 23:17.396
and we will miss you.

23:17.479 --> 23:18.355
Thank you.

23:21.358 --> 23:23.276
-Goodbye, Pancha.
-Goodbye, Panchita.

23:23.360 --> 23:24.569
-All right, then.
-Yes.

23:36.164 --> 23:37.999
I need you to give me your stashes.

23:52.973 --> 23:53.932
Is that everything?

23:55.142 --> 23:56.268
Chava…

24:05.652 --> 24:06.528
Dude!

24:11.324 --> 24:13.493
Hello, come on in.

24:13.577 --> 24:14.453
Thank you.

24:16.997 --> 24:17.831
Hello!

24:22.294 --> 24:23.795
It doesn't look good.

24:25.547 --> 24:27.757
I need you to get
a biopsy as soon as possible.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.469
We need to rule out cancerous tissue.

24:32.179 --> 24:34.222
But you need to have it now, okay?

24:56.203 --> 25:00.373
Daniel, critics agree that you are
the one contemporary Mexican writer

25:00.457 --> 25:02.209
who best depicts sex.

25:02.792 --> 25:04.628
What are your thoughts on this?

25:06.755 --> 25:08.089
I didn't know that.

25:09.716 --> 25:14.721
It's true certain skills
are needed to write these kinds of scenes.

25:15.222 --> 25:20.060
And I admit I've worked hard
to understand the art of love.

25:20.769 --> 25:22.229
Yeah, right, asshole.

25:23.063 --> 25:26.733
I've discovered
that in literature, as in life,

25:26.816 --> 25:29.569
sex is a very interesting doorway

25:29.653 --> 25:33.990
that leads into the depths
of the characters' minds.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.410
Especially female characters.

25:43.250 --> 25:44.084
Wow!

25:44.584 --> 25:46.711
Unbelievable,
you live like actual human beings.

25:48.004 --> 25:48.880
I told you.

25:48.964 --> 25:50.549
We're not as we used to be.

25:55.303 --> 25:56.263
Miguel?

25:56.346 --> 25:58.515
It's all good. Don't worry.

26:00.183 --> 26:01.017
So…

26:04.396 --> 26:05.897
Oh, what was that?

26:08.358 --> 26:09.276
I'll go check.

26:15.407 --> 26:16.616
What the hell, dude?

26:17.659 --> 26:20.579
You're kidding me!
That was my nana's china.

26:20.662 --> 26:24.165
It's your fault, bro, for putting locks
on every door in the house.

26:24.666 --> 26:27.168
I'm surprised
you didn't lock the toilet lid.

26:27.252 --> 26:28.211
Please, no way.

26:28.878 --> 26:30.255
Hey, careful…

26:36.469 --> 26:39.347
-What are you doing?
-I'm getting the baby some milk.

26:42.183 --> 26:43.977
No way! You know how to do that?

26:44.060 --> 26:45.186
Of course, dumbass.

26:50.775 --> 26:51.776
Understand what?

26:53.612 --> 26:55.155
That this isn't working?

26:56.323 --> 26:57.699
I'm sorry, Anuar.

27:00.035 --> 27:02.621
You're right. I'm moving back to my place.

27:02.704 --> 27:03.872
What? No! I mean…

27:03.955 --> 27:05.749
Wait. It's no big deal.

27:05.832 --> 27:08.585
You just told me this isn't working out.

27:08.668 --> 27:09.628
I mean…

27:10.170 --> 27:12.589
it's not all bad. Is it?

27:12.672 --> 27:14.424
Maybe we need more time.

27:14.507 --> 27:16.801
You're just saying that
because I'm leaving.

27:16.885 --> 27:21.306
Sorry, Tere, but you're playing with me.
You toss me around. I'm over it. Sorry.

27:21.389 --> 27:23.266
So, you're breaking up with me?

27:23.350 --> 27:25.477
You're the one who broke this off!

27:25.560 --> 27:27.979
If you don't love me anymore,
just tell me.

27:29.898 --> 27:31.024
Of course I love you….

27:32.692 --> 27:33.985
but I love myself more.

27:34.944 --> 27:36.738
So, this is the last time

27:37.489 --> 27:39.032
I fall back in love with you.

27:39.532 --> 27:40.533
Anuar…

27:42.911 --> 27:43.745
Goodbye.

27:45.330 --> 27:46.456
Goodbye, Tere.

27:54.673 --> 27:55.507
Oh.

27:55.590 --> 27:56.633
-Oh.
-No…

27:56.716 --> 27:59.552
That toy is a hazard.

27:59.636 --> 28:00.845
She loves feathers.

28:00.929 --> 28:02.430
But the point is sharp…

28:02.931 --> 28:06.226
-What the fuck are you doing?
-Don't curse in front of the baby.

28:06.309 --> 28:07.936
Do us a favor and never have kids.

28:08.019 --> 28:09.979
Chava, what's in the milk?

28:10.063 --> 28:12.607
-Cocoa, so it tastes good.
-What's going on?

28:13.358 --> 28:16.653
Chava put cocoa in the formula,
that's what happened.

28:16.736 --> 28:18.988
I put chocolate milk. Children love that.

28:19.072 --> 28:20.740
God! Are you stupid, bro?

28:20.824 --> 28:23.451
Pablo! What the fuck
was on the toilet seat?

28:23.535 --> 28:25.662
-A lock.
-Fuck, dude!

28:25.745 --> 28:28.415
-I told you I'd child-proof it.
-How do I get it off?

28:28.915 --> 28:30.959
Hey, enough. Hey!

28:33.420 --> 28:34.796
I'm really sorry, guys.

28:34.879 --> 28:38.675
I know you tried your best,
but I can't risk Regina's well-being.

28:40.844 --> 28:42.137
This sucks, man.

28:44.681 --> 28:46.391
I hope you understand, guys.

28:50.603 --> 28:52.647
-See?
-It was your fault, dumbass.

28:52.731 --> 28:53.773
Mariana.

28:53.857 --> 28:55.191
It's your fault, dude!

29:00.905 --> 29:02.073
Before you leave,

29:02.157 --> 29:03.867
one last question from the audience.

29:03.950 --> 29:05.493
Certainly, with pleasure.

29:05.577 --> 29:08.079
Any final questions?

29:08.163 --> 29:09.247
Please, sir.

29:10.123 --> 29:12.375
Have you ever written about infidelity?

29:12.459 --> 29:14.711
Yes, in my second novel.

29:15.211 --> 29:18.798
The main point
is that infidelity is a mental state

29:18.882 --> 29:20.633
similar to madness.

29:20.717 --> 29:22.260
Most of the time,

29:22.343 --> 29:26.264
infidelity only exists
in the mind of the person who believes

29:26.347 --> 29:27.724
they have been wronged.

29:29.309 --> 29:31.728
Anyway, that's just a theory.

29:32.270 --> 29:36.608
Thank you all so much for coming.
Let's begin the book signing.

29:39.402 --> 29:41.613
It would mean
postponing the trip a few days

29:41.696 --> 29:43.907
until I get my biopsy and…

29:44.741 --> 29:47.118
they tell me whether it's cancer or not.

29:48.369 --> 29:51.372
-I can't go to Colombia right now.
-Don't worry.

29:52.123 --> 29:54.918
I'll let you know once we have
a new date for the trip.

29:55.001 --> 29:57.337
Meanwhile, do what you have to do

29:57.837 --> 29:59.923
and please keep me posted.

30:02.175 --> 30:03.468
Thank you.

30:04.886 --> 30:06.679
Really, thanks for understanding.

30:12.435 --> 30:13.770
I WILL MISS YOU, MARIANA!

30:13.853 --> 30:16.314
DON'T PULL US APART!

30:16.397 --> 30:19.901
INCOMING CALL: MOM

30:34.791 --> 30:35.625
Juan Carlos?

30:36.376 --> 30:38.419
I think he's not home yet.

30:40.088 --> 30:42.549
-Hey, are you okay?
-Yeah.

30:43.258 --> 30:45.635
-Where are you going?
-To Elena's gig.

30:46.219 --> 30:48.429
Can I come along? I need some distraction.

30:48.513 --> 30:49.514
Sure.

30:51.015 --> 30:55.395
We'll get deeper into it next year…

30:56.813 --> 30:58.523
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

30:58.606 --> 31:00.108
-Excuse me for a bit.
-Go ahead.

31:00.191 --> 31:01.901
-Will you refill my glass?
-Yes.

31:14.622 --> 31:16.416
What do you want, Juan Carlos?

31:17.417 --> 31:19.419
I was thinking about what you said.

31:20.044 --> 31:22.213
"Infidelity is a state of mind."

31:23.506 --> 31:26.384
Do you really believe your own bullshit?

31:26.467 --> 31:28.177
I don't know. Do you?

31:28.261 --> 31:31.723
Following me here seems
like something a madman would do.

31:31.806 --> 31:34.142
What happened between you and my wife?

31:38.313 --> 31:39.606
I'm talking to you, jerk.

31:41.190 --> 31:44.694
Do you know why
infidelity is a state of mind?

31:45.820 --> 31:48.489
Because it lives in the mind
of the insecure husband

31:48.573 --> 31:53.244
who thinks his wife cheated on him
with an ex whom she only met for lunch.

31:55.246 --> 31:56.956
I don't know, think about it.

31:57.874 --> 31:58.708
Hey…

32:01.544 --> 32:03.880
That's for having lunch with my wife.

32:10.970 --> 32:11.971
Choco-shrooms.

32:12.055 --> 32:14.891
The best drug ever.

32:14.974 --> 32:17.060
Elena, please. Ana doesn't do drugs.

32:19.228 --> 32:21.439
It's okay, I've smoked pot.

32:22.023 --> 32:23.316
Elena, we're up.

32:23.399 --> 32:24.817
-Want some?
-No, thanks.

32:24.901 --> 32:25.777
Let's go.

32:26.611 --> 32:27.779
Put that down.

32:28.446 --> 32:29.364
Sorry…

32:30.865 --> 32:32.533
I mean, about your nose.

32:34.702 --> 32:35.620
Sorry for…

32:36.412 --> 32:38.164
stealing Ana from you back in college.

32:38.247 --> 32:40.917
That's what inspired me
to write my first book.

32:41.417 --> 32:44.504
It was called
The Love of Your Life Always Leaves.

32:45.004 --> 32:46.714
But the editor changed it

32:46.798 --> 32:49.634
to Chronicles of a Woman
Who Dreamed of Sunflowers.

32:51.386 --> 32:53.346
For it to have a Murakami sound to it.

32:53.930 --> 32:56.766
Is that because Ana loved sunflowers?

32:56.849 --> 32:57.725
Yes.

32:59.936 --> 33:01.604
You were always so corny.

33:02.647 --> 33:04.190
You know what's silly?

33:04.273 --> 33:06.651
Ana hated the sunflowers you gave her.

33:06.734 --> 33:09.487
Not as much as the serenades you gave her.

33:09.570 --> 33:12.281
She used to call you the college's Arjona.

33:12.865 --> 33:14.826
She loved them, asshole.

33:15.868 --> 33:16.995
She didn't.

33:18.621 --> 33:20.164
-Hey, easy!
-Fuck you, man!

33:20.248 --> 33:21.416
What's going on?

33:43.396 --> 33:44.397
Hey…

33:44.480 --> 33:45.606
What's up?

33:46.107 --> 33:47.400
Let's go home, okay?

33:48.568 --> 33:49.444
Come on.

33:51.738 --> 33:54.866
We can't go home,
it's like a prison to me.

33:56.576 --> 33:58.411
I'm going to die, you know?

33:58.494 --> 34:01.414
Relax, we're all dying someday.

34:01.497 --> 34:04.709
Yes, but I'm dying soon. I'm dying.

34:04.792 --> 34:07.920
I'm so lucky you're Regina's mom
and not someone else.

34:08.504 --> 34:10.423
You're the person I trust the most.

34:10.506 --> 34:14.385
Promise me if something happens to me,
you'll take care of the girls.

34:14.469 --> 34:17.638
Ana, you'll be fine.
Stop saying that. You're not dying.

34:17.722 --> 34:20.850
-Promise me.
-Okay, I promise.

34:22.101 --> 34:24.270
You are also very important to me.

34:25.396 --> 34:26.230
I love you.

34:36.741 --> 34:39.494
"Soldado del Amor." This is my song!

35:02.850 --> 35:04.894
Don't worry. I'm okay.

35:10.566 --> 35:13.528
Don't look so worried,
it'll only be a few stitches.

35:13.611 --> 35:19.033
EMERGENCY ROOM

35:21.452 --> 35:23.329
Come on, man. Cheer up.

35:23.913 --> 35:25.289
Are you still mad at Chava?

35:25.373 --> 35:27.458
No, bro, but screw Chava, you know.

35:27.542 --> 35:30.711
Tell Mariana
to give you another chance, dude.

35:30.795 --> 35:34.006
Actually, she's right.
This is no place for a baby.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.801
I'll have to find my own place.

35:40.930 --> 35:41.848
You're leaving?

35:47.353 --> 35:48.729
I don't know, bro.

35:48.813 --> 35:49.689
Maybe.

35:51.065 --> 35:53.442
It's pointless anyway.
Mariana doesn't trust me.

35:55.361 --> 35:57.280
She'll probably move in with Elena.

36:00.032 --> 36:01.075
Hey, dude,

36:02.201 --> 36:04.579
what if you join forces

36:05.079 --> 36:06.289
with the enemy?

36:13.713 --> 36:15.715
Thanks for agreeing to talk to me.

36:18.593 --> 36:19.552
How's Ana doing?

36:21.095 --> 36:22.388
As if you cared.

36:23.306 --> 36:25.975
I just wanted
to ask you to stop calling me.

36:26.058 --> 36:27.810
I asked for space, you didn't care.

36:27.894 --> 36:31.272
Sweetie, please,
let's start over, no lies this time.

36:31.355 --> 36:32.231
Enough, Mom.

36:32.732 --> 36:35.735
You went too far with Juan Carlos,
and there are consequences.

36:35.818 --> 36:38.279
But there's nothing between us anymore.

36:38.362 --> 36:40.364
The only thing tying us is a debt.

36:41.574 --> 36:42.533
A debt?

36:43.409 --> 36:46.954
Yes. He lent me
the money to start my business.

36:47.455 --> 36:49.290
You took money from Juan Carlos?

36:49.916 --> 36:52.668
Weren't you two over
since before the babies?

36:52.752 --> 36:53.836
We were, I swear.

36:54.462 --> 36:55.421
The thing is,

36:55.504 --> 36:58.674
he helped me out
so we wouldn't lose the apartment.

36:59.842 --> 37:00.676
You know what?

37:01.177 --> 37:03.054
I'm done with this bullshit.

37:04.222 --> 37:07.058
-You're hopeless, Teresa.
-Mariana.

37:07.934 --> 37:09.143
You're being unfair.

37:09.727 --> 37:12.021
Unfair? You know what's unfair?

37:12.104 --> 37:16.400
Having to see Ana every day while
keeping a really dark secret from her.

37:16.901 --> 37:18.194
That's unfair.

37:22.156 --> 37:24.617
I'm not drunk, I'm high.

37:25.826 --> 37:27.495
I'll let you in on a secret.

37:28.704 --> 37:30.081
I'm dying.

37:30.164 --> 37:33.376
First, I'll make a bucket list,
like in the Morgan Freeman movie.

37:33.459 --> 37:34.293
Did you see it?

37:34.377 --> 37:36.629
I've done the first thing on my list.

37:36.712 --> 37:37.672
Doing drugs.

37:39.006 --> 37:41.050
What would you put on your list?

37:41.717 --> 37:46.305
To be honest, the first thing on my list
would be to cheat on my husband.

37:46.389 --> 37:48.849
I want us to be even before I die.

37:48.933 --> 37:51.227
I already did that.

37:51.727 --> 37:53.729
I can scratch it off my list.

37:54.272 --> 37:56.607
But it wasn't to get back at him.

37:56.691 --> 37:58.693
To think you look so prim.

37:58.776 --> 38:02.947
It's always the prim ones
who are most adventurous.

38:05.241 --> 38:07.451
Tell us everything about it.

38:07.535 --> 38:09.161
It was with my ex-boyfriend

38:09.829 --> 38:10.830
on a business trip.

38:11.330 --> 38:12.999
Or rather a pleasure trip!

38:16.460 --> 38:18.087
-Ana!
-Honey!

38:18.170 --> 38:20.256
I'm glad you're here.

38:20.339 --> 38:21.507
You can't be in here.

38:21.590 --> 38:24.719
-Do you need anything?
-He's my husband. Let him stay.

38:24.802 --> 38:27.763
He's the one I told you I cheated on.

38:28.681 --> 38:30.391
Look, these are my friends.

38:30.474 --> 38:33.269
Susanita and Ana? Anita.

38:33.352 --> 38:36.355
-And Susana. No, Lupita.
-I'd like to talk to my wife.

38:36.439 --> 38:38.691
-In private, please.
-She's in no condition.

38:38.774 --> 38:41.819
-She's under the effects of a drug.
-She sounds fine to me.

38:41.902 --> 38:43.362
Oh, Susie, don't be mean.

38:43.446 --> 38:46.574
Let him stay
so I can tell him about my pleasure trip.

38:46.657 --> 38:48.659
Sir, there's no point right now.

38:48.743 --> 38:50.244
It's time for her sedative.

38:50.911 --> 38:51.954
My what?

40:15.955 --> 40:18.999
