00:02.044 --> 00:05.036
Do you know what
I want to do to you tonight?

00:07.591 --> 00:09.821
- You didn't say anything.
- I know.

00:10.011 --> 00:12.525
It was gonna be kinky,
and I got embarrassed.

00:12.722 --> 00:16.236
Really kinky?
Was I a bad girl?

00:16.475 --> 00:19.706
Very bad. You had to go
to the principal's office.

00:23.899 --> 00:26.732
I have an early shift tomorrow.

00:26.944 --> 00:29.378
- I've got to sleep.
- Want me to take you home?

00:29.572 --> 00:32.962
No. But if we're gonna pick up
a schoolgirl outfit and have sex,

00:33.200 --> 00:35.191
we have to leave this minute.

00:35.369 --> 00:39.044
<i>One of the best things about</i>
<i>women is they're unpredictable.</i>

00:39.290 --> 00:41.360
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>that can bite you in the ass.</i>

00:41.542 --> 00:44.102
Boink.
Who's your new friend?

00:44.295 --> 00:47.173
Look, it got a letter.

00:47.381 --> 00:50.418
So I put on a few pounds.

00:50.634 --> 00:53.592
But how would you like it
if somebody did this to you?

00:53.804 --> 00:55.715
I wouldn't.

00:55.890 --> 00:58.404
- I don't think it's fair.
- It isn't fair.

00:58.601 --> 01:01.240
- Now, eat your doughnut.
- Eat your doughnut.

01:01.437 --> 01:04.747
<i>And I was having problems</i>
<i>with my lady too.</i>

01:04.982 --> 01:09.817
Get a move on. I got tickets to
<i>Bring in 'Da Noise, Bring in 'Da Funk.</i>

01:10.112 --> 01:12.501
We're gonna take blood so we can check

01:12.698 --> 01:16.088
your hepatitis viral load.
Absolutely no big deal.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:25.628 --> 01:27.141
<i>No big deal at all.</i>

01:27.296 --> 01:29.685
Could somebody get that?

01:44.563 --> 01:47.077
These tests
are gonna come back negative.

01:47.274 --> 01:50.789
Everybody who works
in a hospital eventually gets stuck.

01:51.028 --> 01:52.780
Thanks for being so nice to me.

01:52.947 --> 01:55.461
Who wouldn't be nice to you right now?

01:55.658 --> 01:59.446
I understand you might need
a refresher course in hospital safety.

01:59.704 --> 02:02.377
This is a syringe.
When filled with infected blood,

02:02.581 --> 02:06.096
where is the last place
you might want to stick it?

02:06.335 --> 02:09.645
- In my arm.
- Very good, Dr Dorian.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.917
Mr Sarcastic strikes again.

02:13.134 --> 02:16.206
For God's sake, sir, just fire me.

02:16.429 --> 02:19.227
Just get him to sign the damn paper.

02:20.725 --> 02:22.044
What's this?

02:22.184 --> 02:26.496
If you develop any symptoms that suggest
you may have contracted hepatitis B,

02:26.772 --> 02:30.082
this form states
the hospital is not responsible.

02:30.317 --> 02:33.036
Thanks. That's comforting.

02:33.237 --> 02:35.273
I'm sure you'll be fine.

02:35.448 --> 02:36.767
Here's your pen.

02:38.284 --> 02:41.003
Keep it.

02:48.002 --> 02:49.993
Is he gonna make it?

02:50.171 --> 02:53.481
- Doesn't look good.
- Yay!

03:00.222 --> 03:03.851
Isn't that what you were wearing
when you left last night?

03:04.101 --> 03:06.092
<i>The walk of shame.</i>

03:06.270 --> 03:10.104
<i>All you can hope for is a supportive</i>
<i>friend to help you get through it.</i>

03:11.734 --> 03:14.248
<i>Elliot got some booty</i>

03:16.781 --> 03:18.453
Stop it.

03:18.616 --> 03:21.210
What? It's my
''Elliot got some booty'' dance.

03:24.622 --> 03:28.501
Elliot,
it's not like anybody else knows.

03:28.751 --> 03:32.744
- What's up, porn star?
- Somebody toasted that marshmallow.

03:34.674 --> 03:36.266
Well?

03:37.635 --> 03:40.433
<i>Somebody got some action</i>

03:43.224 --> 03:45.055
Come on. It's funny.

03:45.226 --> 03:48.696
I can't find my scrubs top.
I must've left it at Sean's.

03:48.938 --> 03:51.054
<i>The curse of the scrubs machine.</i>

03:51.232 --> 03:53.746
<i>One of the hospital's</i>
<i>annoying money savers.</i>

03:53.943 --> 03:57.333
<i>The only way to get clean scrubs out</i>
<i>is to put dirty ones in.</i>

03:57.571 --> 03:59.766
- How can I help?
- Give me your shirt.

03:59.949 --> 04:02.338
- How else can I help?
- Just go.

04:14.630 --> 04:17.144
Good morning, sir.

04:17.341 --> 04:20.617
And yet another
proud day for Dr Reid.

04:20.845 --> 04:24.474
I'd say it can only get better,
but we both know that isn't true.

04:24.724 --> 04:26.919
Right, sweetheart?

04:27.101 --> 04:29.456
Yeah.

04:30.980 --> 04:32.936
You know I'm crazy in love with you.

04:33.107 --> 04:36.144
Don't tell me you're obsessing
over a joke I made.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.510
- I'm not obsessing.
- Good.

04:38.696 --> 04:40.846
Careful. I just might eat you.

04:41.032 --> 04:44.945
I see it all the time: The long hours,
the stress eating, no exercise.

04:45.202 --> 04:47.591
There's not a doctor here
who's in shape.

04:47.788 --> 04:51.576
Nothing better than a good sweat.

04:54.712 --> 04:57.351
Turk! It was a joke!

04:57.798 --> 04:59.754
Alrighty.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.756
What do we have here?

05:01.927 --> 05:05.602
What you've got here are four cases
of Legionnaires' pneumonia.

05:05.848 --> 05:08.408
So I would start us out
on IV aminoglycosides.

05:08.601 --> 05:11.195
Check for urinary legionella antigen.

05:11.395 --> 05:15.070
It could be viral, considering
my gastrointestinal situation.

05:15.316 --> 05:17.068
Here comes the fart joke.

05:17.234 --> 05:19.509
I think I may have strep pneumo.

05:19.695 --> 05:23.768
- All four of us are doctors.
- Let me guess. Golf cart accident?

05:25.618 --> 05:28.496
- Playing.
- Medical convention.

05:28.704 --> 05:31.980
So, what's with
the antecubital venipuncture?

05:32.208 --> 05:36.042
I got hit with
of one of my hep B patients' syringes.

05:36.295 --> 05:39.651
I once had a colleague
who got bit by a patient with rabies.

05:39.882 --> 05:42.191
- He's OK, right?
- No, he died.

05:42.385 --> 05:44.819
A friend from med school
contracted leprosy.

05:45.012 --> 05:48.004
They amputated one of his toes.
Popped it right off.

05:48.224 --> 05:50.658
But hepatitis. Scary stuff.

05:50.851 --> 05:54.400
- I'll be OK.
- Maybe.

05:54.647 --> 05:58.276
I have to go check on a thing...

06:03.614 --> 06:05.445
To interns.

06:11.455 --> 06:14.845
- We cannot have intercourse tonight.
- Stop calling it that.

06:15.084 --> 06:18.076
I'm falling so behind
on my reading, and I really...

06:18.295 --> 06:20.809
Don't always assume
I wanna be fooling around.

06:21.007 --> 06:24.079
Sometimes I'm happy just
thinking about fooling around.

06:24.301 --> 06:27.373
Why can't couples just be together?

06:27.596 --> 06:30.474
- Why is it always about sex?
- Yes, Sean.

06:30.683 --> 06:35.916
Freud said 90% of all human behaviour
is motivated by sexual impulses.

06:36.230 --> 06:39.063
30% of my behaviour
is motivated by advertising,

06:39.275 --> 06:41.311
and the rest by violence in film.

06:41.485 --> 06:45.194
For me it's 98% getting my dad
to love me, 2% chocolate.

06:47.825 --> 06:52.262
Now, you have to stop talking to me
so I can get some work done.

06:58.044 --> 07:00.604
Say it.

07:00.796 --> 07:02.787
Intercourse.

07:06.761 --> 07:09.992
Way to get your burger on.

07:10.222 --> 07:13.532
Just exactly what in the hell is this?

07:13.768 --> 07:15.759
I need to talk to you.

07:15.936 --> 07:20.805
Dr Cox, I haven't had a chance
to tell you this yet. Your name rocks!

07:22.026 --> 07:23.857
Come on!

07:24.070 --> 07:27.107
This conversation stops
until cabana boy here goes.

07:27.323 --> 07:29.200
- He's not the boss of me.
- Todd.

07:29.367 --> 07:30.322
Cool.

07:32.828 --> 07:35.581
So how do you do it?
How do you stay in shape?

07:35.790 --> 07:38.509
Discipline.
Some of us work on our appearance.

07:38.709 --> 07:41.781
Could I work out with you some time?

07:42.004 --> 07:44.438
I don't know about that.

07:44.632 --> 07:47.704
I'm not particularly fond of you,
although

07:47.927 --> 07:51.397
it might be fun to see you
flail about for a couple of days.

07:51.639 --> 07:54.028
You know what?
Forget about it.

07:54.225 --> 07:56.693
You see that guy there?

07:56.894 --> 07:58.964
That's you in five years.

08:01.482 --> 08:02.995
You in ten years.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.141
And guess what, He-Man?

08:05.319 --> 08:07.275
You in 20.

08:08.739 --> 08:10.058
I'm in.

08:11.742 --> 08:16.691
<i>I won't let those doctors scare me.</i>
<i>I always get right back on the horse.</i>

08:19.083 --> 08:23.395
I'm so sorry you're alone, Mr Winston,
but meningococcus is highly contagious.

08:23.671 --> 08:27.107
- I don't have anyone to talk to.
- Good news, friend.

08:27.341 --> 08:30.060
The doctor is in.

08:30.261 --> 08:34.937
I asked for a newspaper, and they gave
me Judy Blume books from Paediatrics.

08:35.224 --> 08:37.897
I don't know anything about those.

08:38.102 --> 08:40.332
Read <i>Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing.</i>

08:40.520 --> 08:43.159
Completely turned
high school around for me.

08:44.150 --> 08:47.506
<i>You see? Nobody keeps</i>
<i>John Dorian from moving on.</i>

08:47.737 --> 08:49.728
<i>Nobody.</i>

08:52.074 --> 08:55.510
We've replaced this doctor's blood
with hepatitis blood.

08:55.745 --> 08:57.576
Let's see if he notices.

08:57.747 --> 09:01.626
I could be really sick here.
Could you be nice for once?

09:03.377 --> 09:05.254
How's that?

09:05.421 --> 09:09.539
I have not been this happy
since, well, ever.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.360
Don't you think Sean and I
are a great couple?

09:12.553 --> 09:15.670
I don't know Sean,
and you've never spoken to me before.

09:15.890 --> 09:18.120
We just click on every level.

09:18.309 --> 09:21.142
- God, and the sex.
- My name is Vijay.

09:21.354 --> 09:25.825
Let's see who's on their game and start
off with a case of pheochromocytoma.

09:26.108 --> 09:28.303
What is the initial test, Dr Reid?

09:28.486 --> 09:30.397
24-hour urinary metanephrines?

09:30.571 --> 09:33.529
Right-o. And what is your
preoperative treatment?

09:33.741 --> 09:35.459
- ACE inhibitors?
- Wrong-o.

09:35.618 --> 09:39.213
Why don't you attempt to crawl out
of your shame hole,

09:39.455 --> 09:43.812
and tell me the aetiology
of hypocalcaemia in sarcoidosis.

09:46.462 --> 09:48.054
Gutter ball!

09:48.214 --> 09:51.684
Yesterday you were
running around my hospital half-naked.

09:51.926 --> 09:54.884
- Yeah, baby.
- Today you're mucking up my rounds.

09:55.096 --> 09:56.814
Is your ponytail too tight?

09:56.972 --> 09:59.691
Perhaps you have a case
of the boogie-woogie flu?

09:59.892 --> 10:05.285
Something is different,
because you are slipping.

10:05.606 --> 10:07.597
Next patient.

10:10.277 --> 10:15.351
The key to my exercise programme is
this one simple truth: I hate my body.

10:15.658 --> 10:17.057
What?

10:17.201 --> 10:19.669
The second you look in the mirror

10:19.870 --> 10:23.260
and you're happy with what you see,
you just lost the battle.

10:23.499 --> 10:26.457
You should give speeches
to teenage girls.

10:26.669 --> 10:30.298
- I've been looking all over for you.
- Did you bring his leash?

10:30.548 --> 10:33.381
- What are you doing?
- Going for a run with Dr Cox.

10:33.592 --> 10:36.504
But we were supposed to go to the park.

10:36.721 --> 10:39.235
I was gonna let you
tell me how pretty I am.

10:39.432 --> 10:41.627
- See ya, chubby!
- Son of a...

10:41.809 --> 10:44.323
Baby, you're prettier every day.

10:46.397 --> 10:48.627
I'm prettier in the park.

10:50.234 --> 10:53.544
<i>I don't know what it is,</i>
<i>but I'm noticing something.</i>

10:53.779 --> 10:57.977
<i>In this hospital,</i>
<i>there are sick people everywhere.</i>

11:13.466 --> 11:15.775
I'm OK.

11:30.816 --> 11:35.492
You're a jumpy little fellow. Your blood
tests are negative, so you're fine.

11:35.780 --> 11:39.978
I think I speak for the entire
administration when I say ''whoop-de-do''.

11:40.242 --> 11:41.960
Wrap it up for me, Ned.

11:42.119 --> 11:45.236
- It's Ted.
- I know.

11:45.456 --> 11:49.244
I know a guy who can
take care of him for us.

11:56.550 --> 11:58.745
One phone call.

12:01.931 --> 12:05.640
<i>I knew I didn't have hepatitis.</i>
<i>Why did I make myself crazy?</i>

12:05.893 --> 12:08.088
<i>John Dorian is stronger than that.</i>

12:10.398 --> 12:13.868
<i>I said John Dorian</i>
<i>is stronger than that.</i>

12:14.110 --> 12:18.626
Carla, could you do me a favour and
just give him a follow-up neuro exam?

12:18.906 --> 12:21.181
I'm just so swamped right now.

12:21.367 --> 12:24.359
- Sure, Bambi. No problem.
- Thank you.

12:24.578 --> 12:26.887
<i>John Dorian's a wuss.</i>

12:32.378 --> 12:35.495
<i>It wasn't that hard for me</i>
<i>to avoid my contagious guy.</i>

12:35.715 --> 12:39.025
Carla, can you check Kernig
and Brudzinski signs on Mr Winston?

12:39.260 --> 12:43.253
- And why can't you do it?
- I would, but I don't got no mojo.

12:43.514 --> 12:45.903
I have to go lecture
some med students

12:46.100 --> 12:48.136
on myocardial infarction.

12:48.310 --> 12:53.464
I saw them waiting for you
in the You're Full of Crap Ward.

12:53.774 --> 12:55.765
You know the way.

12:58.738 --> 13:00.854
What are you doing here?

13:01.032 --> 13:04.308
I bought extra scrubs
so you never have to work topless again.

13:04.535 --> 13:07.891
Unless you start dancing,
which I'm OK with.

13:08.122 --> 13:11.080
- Great. So he's thoughtful too.
- Are you mad at me?

13:11.292 --> 13:13.852
The yelling makes it
seem like you're mad.

13:14.045 --> 13:15.273
You would know.

13:15.421 --> 13:19.050
You're so thoughtful and handsome,
you wouldn't forget your scrubs.

13:19.300 --> 13:24.499
I don't wear scrubs. One time, I locked
my keys in my car while it was running.

13:24.805 --> 13:28.718
- On a bridge.
- I have to go.

13:28.976 --> 13:32.127
I'll call you later, and you can
explain what just happened.

13:33.606 --> 13:35.995
Don't be embarrassed
about staring at my ass.

13:36.192 --> 13:39.025
You're only human,
and everybody does it anyway.

13:41.530 --> 13:43.839
Lonely?

13:45.034 --> 13:46.865
A little.

13:47.036 --> 13:51.029
- I'm doing this for someone else.
- What do you say we pick it up?

13:51.290 --> 13:53.599
Let's pick it up.

13:53.793 --> 13:55.909
<i>When someone calls you out,</i>

13:56.087 --> 13:58.840
<i>there's only one thing to do:</i>
<i>Deal with your fear.</i>

13:59.048 --> 14:02.040
Dr Cox, could I get you
to cover Mr Winston?

14:02.259 --> 14:05.888
He's my meningitis patient.
A personality difference.

14:06.138 --> 14:08.606
He says tomato, and I say...

14:10.142 --> 14:11.461
...''to-mah-to.''

14:11.602 --> 14:15.038
Sure. I'll take him.
You grab my three gomers in 408.

14:15.272 --> 14:18.582
- What's wrong with them?
- I assume they're sick.

14:18.818 --> 14:21.935
I thought about what you said before,
and you're right.

14:22.154 --> 14:23.826
I haven't been that nice.

14:23.989 --> 14:26.059
- And?
- That's it.

14:26.242 --> 14:31.111
What, do you want to go to a ballgame
and share a big tub of popcorn?

14:35.209 --> 14:37.200
That's the last time I reach out.

14:37.378 --> 14:40.256
Anybody want to go to a...
Not you.

14:41.841 --> 14:44.435
- Doctors.
- Doctor.

14:44.635 --> 14:45.988
I love that.

14:46.137 --> 14:49.732
Dr Douglas, I got the results back
from your fasting lipids.

14:49.974 --> 14:53.046
Your LLD's very elevated,
so you may want to start a...

14:54.895 --> 14:57.773
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor?

14:57.982 --> 14:59.654
- You knew the answer.
- Shut up.

14:59.817 --> 15:03.412
- What's your problem?
- This doesn't come easy for me.

15:03.654 --> 15:07.727
I study every night, and you know what
else I do to remember all this crap?

15:07.992 --> 15:12.224
I tape record myself saying it,
and I listen to myself over and over.

15:12.496 --> 15:18.492
Do you have any idea how annoying it is
to hear myself go on and on and on

15:19.295 --> 15:21.206
and on?

15:21.380 --> 15:22.733
No.

15:22.882 --> 15:27.478
Come on. I have problems too.
I traded my meningitis patient.

15:27.762 --> 15:30.230
Traded him like a baseball card.

15:30.431 --> 15:32.740
Wanna know why?
I was afraid of him.

15:32.933 --> 15:37.211
I'm a doctor who's afraid of sick
people. Wanna take a picture with me?

15:37.480 --> 15:40.836
<i>It's a weird feeling when</i>
<i>you realise you've lost the respect</i>

15:41.067 --> 15:43.103
<i>of four people all at once.</i>

15:45.571 --> 15:49.689
<i>But it's nothing compared to</i>
<i>losing respect for yourself.</i>

15:53.788 --> 15:55.585
Push it out. Two more.

15:55.748 --> 15:57.864
Come on, kid. Bitchin' reps.

15:58.042 --> 16:00.954
- A dumb-ass says what?
- What?

16:01.170 --> 16:04.128
I said,
''A dumb-ass says what?''

16:06.008 --> 16:07.361
What?

16:07.510 --> 16:10.263
- You're down here again?
- 20!

16:10.471 --> 16:12.268
Hey, baby.

16:12.431 --> 16:16.504
- You likes?
- I miss you.

16:16.769 --> 16:21.604
Maybe tonight we can, you know,
rent a movie and then not watch it.

16:21.899 --> 16:24.493
We just got started down here.

16:27.029 --> 16:28.906
No problem.

16:29.073 --> 16:32.110
Just don't wake me up if you
get home too late, OK?

16:34.036 --> 16:38.109
Props for the commitment.

16:39.333 --> 16:42.689
- I'm out.
- And there it is.

16:42.920 --> 16:45.115
I knew your ass would quit.

16:45.297 --> 16:47.857
- I got a life.
- Cry me a river.

16:48.050 --> 16:50.086
My dance card is full-up too.

16:50.261 --> 16:52.536
How many nights a week
are you in here?

16:52.722 --> 16:54.792
- A few.
- He's being modest.

16:54.974 --> 16:57.534
He's down here
polishing his guns every night.

16:57.727 --> 16:59.877
That doesn't mean I don't have a life.

17:00.062 --> 17:03.020
A couple times we went
out for a beer after.

17:03.232 --> 17:06.109
- You two have fun.
- Dr Cox.

17:06.318 --> 17:09.195
- Can I get a spot?
- I'm here for you.

17:10.531 --> 17:11.884
Oh, God.

17:12.032 --> 17:13.989
I gotta meet someone.

17:14.160 --> 17:16.594
Big kahuna, little help?

17:22.792 --> 17:26.183
I just came by to apologise.

17:26.422 --> 17:29.220
- For what?
- I'm not sure.

17:29.425 --> 17:31.381
But I am really sorry.

17:31.552 --> 17:34.783
I should be the one apologising.
I got so buried in work,

17:35.014 --> 17:37.608
and then I just took it all out on you.

17:37.808 --> 17:41.847
I'm big on forgiving people who look
like they're about to kiss me.

17:46.609 --> 17:48.759
And the work never ends.

17:48.944 --> 17:51.936
I have to be ready for rounds,
take care of my patients,

17:52.156 --> 17:54.590
I have scut work
and research papers due.

17:54.784 --> 17:57.776
And if my internship
does not go well this year,

17:57.995 --> 18:00.828
I'm not getting
a good residency next year.

18:01.040 --> 18:04.077
And without the residency,
there goes my fellowship,

18:04.293 --> 18:06.966
and that doesn't leave
a lot of time for us.

18:07.171 --> 18:11.244
So I think that maybe
we should make this more casual.

18:11.509 --> 18:14.979
But, come on,
I know I could never be casual with you.

18:15.221 --> 18:18.531
We'd just end up here again, right?

18:19.850 --> 18:22.000
What are you saying?

18:22.186 --> 18:24.256
I don't know.

18:24.438 --> 18:27.589
Then why are you saying it?

18:27.817 --> 18:29.216
My God.

18:29.360 --> 18:33.035
I think I'm saying that I can't
make this work right now.

18:33.280 --> 18:38.035
I've got an idea. Let's go back to where
you said that you should be apologising.

18:38.327 --> 18:40.887
Then we'll kiss again,
cos that was good.

18:41.080 --> 18:45.358
Sean, you don't understand how hard
it was for me just to get to this point.

18:45.626 --> 18:49.062
If I don't do my best,
I'm going to hate myself for ever.

18:49.296 --> 18:51.412
What's with being the best?

18:51.590 --> 18:54.582
What is so bad about being adequate?
That's what I do.

18:54.802 --> 18:56.997
No, you don't.

18:59.765 --> 19:01.198
I know.

19:03.436 --> 19:05.825
I have to go back in.

19:11.736 --> 19:14.967
I'm just gonna stand here
and wait with these flowers

19:15.197 --> 19:19.748
cos in two minutes you'll realise
what a big mistake you're making.

19:21.078 --> 19:23.114
I hope so.

19:31.589 --> 19:34.786
- I want my meningitis patient back.
- No.

19:35.009 --> 19:38.718
Do you know any women who hate
themselves enough to date me?

19:38.971 --> 19:41.929
- Why'd you let me switch patients?
- You asked me to.

19:42.141 --> 19:45.975
- And because of your puppy-dog eyes.
- You knew I was scared.

19:46.228 --> 19:48.219
Why didn't you tell me to deal with it?

19:48.397 --> 19:50.547
I don't know what it was about that day.

19:50.733 --> 19:54.282
Maybe I hadn't had enough sleep,
maybe my mind was on other things.

19:54.528 --> 19:59.886
Maybe I didn't have enough fibre,
and failed to do my morning business.

20:00.201 --> 20:02.840
I don't know what it was,
but the bottom line is

20:03.037 --> 20:05.312
I didn't feel like
spelling it out for you.

20:05.498 --> 20:09.093
You want your little speech,
and that's fine, because here it is.

20:09.335 --> 20:11.803
You're a doctor. You might get sick.

20:12.004 --> 20:13.403
Get over it.

20:13.547 --> 20:15.856
Thank you.
Now, can I have my patient back?

20:16.050 --> 20:21.647
No. Because, aside from
his weird Judy Blume obsession,

20:21.972 --> 20:25.601
I like him.
You will be delousing Mr Schaffer.

20:25.851 --> 20:27.921
Guy's like flypaper.

20:28.104 --> 20:29.457
Fantastic.

20:29.605 --> 20:31.197
And, Belinda,

20:31.357 --> 20:33.587
do you know what else
is real contagious?

20:33.776 --> 20:35.926
A big ol' smile!

20:38.864 --> 20:40.775
<i>When you start med school,</i>

20:40.950 --> 20:44.147
<i>they warn you that you're gonna</i>
<i>have to make sacrifices.</i>

20:46.789 --> 20:49.701
<i>That means different things</i>
<i>to different people.</i>

20:52.586 --> 20:54.975
<i>Like giving up something you want now</i>

20:55.172 --> 20:57.891
<i>for something you've wanted</i>
<i>your whole life.</i>

20:59.760 --> 21:01.796
<i>Or spending less time on yourself</i>

21:01.971 --> 21:04.804
<i>so you can spend more time</i>
<i>with someone you love.</i>

21:12.148 --> 21:16.141
<i>At some point, you might even have to</i>
<i>give up your own sense of safety.</i>

21:21.240 --> 21:24.391
<i>After a while, it doesn't feel like</i>
<i>you're giving up anything.</i>

21:24.618 --> 21:28.088
- Hey, doc.
- You know what?

21:28.331 --> 21:30.367
Let's talk <i>Superfudge.</i>
