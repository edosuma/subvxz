WEBVTT

00:22.731 --> 00:24.733
You should've stayed
in your hole, Bill.

00:46.004 --> 00:47.005
God...

00:55.055 --> 00:56.473
-Stop the car.
-What?

00:57.015 --> 00:59.017
-Stop the car. Stop the car.
-No way, man!

00:59.100 --> 01:00.643
What are you, out of your goddamn mind?

01:00.727 --> 01:03.021
Stop the car! I said stop the car!

01:03.104 --> 01:04.564
No way, man.

01:06.900 --> 01:07.901
Now.

01:15.992 --> 01:16.826
Hey!

01:17.994 --> 01:20.080
God damn it.

01:24.125 --> 01:25.126
Shit.

01:59.285 --> 02:01.079
You do this to me, Frank?

02:18.388 --> 02:19.347
Shit.

02:19.430 --> 02:20.473
I said...

02:23.852 --> 02:25.353
...did you do this to me?

02:26.062 --> 02:28.064
You're goddamn right I did!

02:51.838 --> 02:52.839
Shit.

03:02.682 --> 03:05.143
Strike team, move out!
Move out!

03:06.978 --> 03:08.271
Everybody, careful!

03:08.354 --> 03:09.647
Put down your weapon!

03:09.731 --> 03:11.524
Put down your weapon!

03:18.740 --> 03:20.283
Three o'clock! Over there!

03:22.535 --> 03:24.329
Move out! Move out!

03:30.043 --> 03:31.336
Down! Down! Down!

03:35.381 --> 03:37.133
Let's go! Billy! Get in!

03:51.981 --> 03:53.691
Billy, now! Move!

05:13.771 --> 05:14.772
Get out of the way!

05:47.055 --> 05:49.557
Drop the gun, Frank! Drop it!

06:08.284 --> 06:09.327
Kick it over.

06:13.122 --> 06:14.582
Now get on your knees.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.168
Nice and slow.

06:23.007 --> 06:24.801
It's been a while, Frank.

06:29.555 --> 06:33.142
Sir, I'm gonna need you to let him go now.

06:33.768 --> 06:34.936
Who the hell are you?

06:36.646 --> 06:39.107
I'm the guy with the AR-10
pointed at your head.

06:44.278 --> 06:45.571
Frank, let's go.

06:52.203 --> 06:54.330
You're going after the wrong guy.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.499
New York doesn't need your shit again.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.670
If I leave this alley,
you gonna follow me?

07:00.753 --> 07:02.338
You better believe it.

07:03.506 --> 07:04.799
Frank!

07:04.882 --> 07:05.883
Yeah.

07:06.843 --> 07:07.969
I apologize.

07:08.052 --> 07:09.220
For what?

07:12.098 --> 07:13.975
Now, Frank! Let's move!

07:23.151 --> 07:24.944
God damn, that was insane!

07:25.528 --> 07:26.654
You guys okay?

07:27.321 --> 07:29.490
Man, what the hell just happened?

07:29.574 --> 07:30.908
Ask the maniac in the car.

07:30.992 --> 07:32.076
How much you think we got?

07:32.160 --> 07:33.786
We gotta count it first, dumbass.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.122
And you?

07:38.791 --> 07:39.834
Nice work, brother.

07:39.917 --> 07:42.003
Thought that crazy old bitch
was gonna screw us.

07:42.086 --> 07:43.880
-Was that grenade real?
-Sure was.

07:43.963 --> 07:46.257
Shit. I thought it was a fake.
Who is this dude?

07:46.340 --> 07:48.259
He's the asshole
who nearly got us caught.

07:49.510 --> 07:50.678
You even listening?

07:50.761 --> 07:53.389
What the hell was the Punisher
doing there, you crazy son of a bitch?

07:53.473 --> 07:55.933
Let's just make the cut
and get out of here.

07:56.017 --> 07:58.686
You'll get your cut
like the rest of us. Right, Billy?

08:01.314 --> 08:03.941
It seems I'm due a little bit more
than the rest of you guys.

08:04.025 --> 08:06.819
We split this up even,
fair and square. That was the deal.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.116
You should've stayed
in your hole, Bill.

08:17.246 --> 08:18.247
Yeah, it's me.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.715
Billy, what do you say?

08:29.759 --> 08:31.677
Wait. Why are you asking him?

08:32.553 --> 08:35.723
This jigsaw-faced bastard
almost got us busted.

08:35.806 --> 08:38.476
This whole thing went sideways
'cause you lost your shit.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.311
Screw all this. Let's just split it.

08:59.997 --> 09:02.917
Anybody else got a problem
with the way that I do things?

09:04.335 --> 09:05.294
You're good.

09:15.054 --> 09:17.848
I just took a shot
at a New York City police officer.

09:20.059 --> 09:22.395
Jesus Christ, Frank.
What are we doing, man?

09:23.479 --> 09:25.982
How long you think it's gonna take
for them to figure out

09:26.065 --> 09:28.693
who Frank Castle's
one-legged black friend is, huh?

09:30.653 --> 09:34.907
I hate to say this, Curt, but, um...
there is somebody else, you know.

09:35.616 --> 09:37.535
-Screw you, Frank.

09:37.618 --> 09:38.494
Screw you.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.371
Look, I got a bunch of 'em.
What do you want?

09:40.454 --> 09:43.583
I got a bunch of black one-legged friends.
I mean, I have what I have.

09:43.666 --> 09:46.419
That's a lie. That's a lie.

09:46.502 --> 09:48.588
Yeah, you're the only one for me, Curtis.

09:51.799 --> 09:53.634
I told you to stay in the car.

09:53.718 --> 09:54.885
I did. I did.

09:56.095 --> 09:59.640
Until I saw a sniper
about to blow your head off.

10:02.643 --> 10:04.312
You see, here's the thing, Frank...

10:05.438 --> 10:07.356
You keep telling people to stay out of it,

10:07.940 --> 10:11.402
but they care about you,
whether you like it or not.

10:12.778 --> 10:15.281
-And I wasn't about to see you die.
-Yeah.

10:16.907 --> 10:18.200
I'd have been all right.

10:18.284 --> 10:21.579
Bullshit! That guy
would have shot your head off.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.125
You know, when I saw Bill,

10:27.251 --> 10:28.711
he looked at me like...

10:30.212 --> 10:32.006
like nothing had changed, you know?

10:32.089 --> 10:33.466
Like we were still friends.

10:34.675 --> 10:38.054
I'm telling you, when I drew on him,
he was shocked, you know?

10:38.137 --> 10:39.138
He was...

10:39.930 --> 10:41.307
It was like he was hurt.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.518
You know, he was all confused.

10:44.602 --> 10:46.771
Like I had betrayed him.

10:50.232 --> 10:51.817
I looked at his face...

10:53.903 --> 10:56.739
I saw Maria, I saw the kids...

10:58.366 --> 11:01.661
Saw how we always used to be together.
You know? We were...

11:01.744 --> 11:03.663
We were family, you know?

11:03.746 --> 11:05.581
I swear to God, he saw it, too.

11:09.085 --> 11:11.962
I'll tell you right now, Curt,
he does not know what he did.

11:13.297 --> 11:14.965
He doesn't. I saw that.

11:15.549 --> 11:16.967
You know, I had the shot...

11:21.097 --> 11:22.264
and I froze.

11:25.142 --> 11:27.728
It was just for a second,
but then it was too late.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.023
...getaway car.
It's the garage on 19th.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.567
It's got two DBs, no sign of anyone else.

11:33.651 --> 11:36.487
This is Mahoney.
Secure the scene. I'm on the way.

11:42.159 --> 11:43.160
Let's go.

12:19.613 --> 12:20.698
Krista!

12:22.908 --> 12:23.826
Krista.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.203
Please, please open the door.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.044
Krista, please let me in.

12:44.555 --> 12:45.556
Please...

12:50.019 --> 12:51.353
I thought you were gone.

12:54.440 --> 12:55.900
I thought a lot of things.

12:58.235 --> 12:59.779
And none of them were real.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.201
You can't come and go as you please.

13:09.371 --> 13:10.998
Yeah, I got nowhere else to go.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.626
You want me to beg, I'll beg.

13:22.593 --> 13:23.803
Krista. Krista!

13:49.912 --> 13:51.413
-Where have you been?

13:52.957 --> 13:54.542
It doesn't matter.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.335
It looks like it matters.
What's in the bag?

13:56.418 --> 13:59.088
No, it doesn't matter.
None of it... None of it matters!

13:59.171 --> 14:03.175
All this! All this was Frank Castle!
Frank...

14:04.677 --> 14:06.136
Your friend, Frank?

14:07.805 --> 14:08.931
Friend?

14:09.014 --> 14:10.099
He...

14:10.808 --> 14:12.852
He tried to kill me.

14:13.602 --> 14:14.728
I couldn't see.

14:14.812 --> 14:15.938
That skull...

14:16.021 --> 14:19.692
That skull that I dream about every night,
he wears it on his chest.

14:19.775 --> 14:23.404
Every night! Every night, coming at me
and coming at me. It was him!

14:23.487 --> 14:26.156
It was him! But I couldn't see!

14:26.240 --> 14:28.909
Why Why would he...

14:28.993 --> 14:30.327
Why... why would he do that?

14:30.411 --> 14:33.956
Why would he do any of it?
I don't understand. I don't understand!

14:36.041 --> 14:38.168
I mean, I know now that it was him.

14:38.252 --> 14:39.420
But I don't feel it!

14:40.337 --> 14:42.756
I mean, I know, but I... but I don't know.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.800
I mean, here, but not here.

14:47.219 --> 14:48.888
And he was my best friend.

14:50.180 --> 14:51.348
My best friend.

14:54.184 --> 14:56.562
But he was pointing a gun at me.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.281
Sorry.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.243
I'm so sorry.

15:18.334 --> 15:20.210
But I don't know what else to do.

15:20.961 --> 15:21.962
And you're...

15:22.046 --> 15:25.883
you're the only one... who can help me.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.720
You're the only one.

17:54.948 --> 17:56.617
Anton Reed.

17:57.326 --> 17:58.410
The hostage.

18:00.037 --> 18:01.121
Shit.

18:01.705 --> 18:04.666
Bet poor Anton didn't see this coming
when he showed up for work today.

18:07.002 --> 18:11.840
Now, this guy... could be one of the gang.

18:11.924 --> 18:15.010
Could be somebody else
just got in the way.

18:15.094 --> 18:18.555
Russo's cold... or crazy or both.

18:19.264 --> 18:21.683
Let's get forensics down
to check for fingerprints or whatever.

18:21.767 --> 18:25.687
I wanna find out also how long has he been
working at that check-cashing place.

18:30.734 --> 18:32.111
What's up, man?

18:32.194 --> 18:33.362
Let's go. We gotta drive.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.447
What did you see

18:37.324 --> 18:38.450
I saw bodies.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.036
He shot the hostage, Curt.

18:44.873 --> 18:47.501
Curtis, we've got to get
off this road. Okay?

18:51.463 --> 18:54.341
I need you to try to keep it together now.
We gotta get off this road.

18:54.424 --> 18:56.343
-We gotta move.
-I had a shot.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.221
When he was on the street coming at you,

18:59.304 --> 19:00.848
-I had a shot, man.
-Yeah.

19:04.935 --> 19:07.938
I could've killed him.
I could've killed him, man.

19:08.021 --> 19:10.232
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
don't do that. All right?

19:10.315 --> 19:13.318
-That hostage would be alive right now.
-What are you doing that for?

19:13.402 --> 19:15.404
Shit happens. Shit happens. You know that.

19:15.487 --> 19:18.407
What are you talking about

19:18.490 --> 19:20.117
We are out, man!

19:20.701 --> 19:22.870
We did our time, we served,

19:22.953 --> 19:26.123
we pulled the trigger when we had to,
and we followed orders.

19:26.206 --> 19:28.125
But this, this is different.

19:28.208 --> 19:31.378
And everything about this is so wrong!
Can you see that, Frank?

19:31.461 --> 19:35.174
Huh? Us sitting here, right now,
having this conversation.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.466
And it's not even over.

19:36.550 --> 19:39.386
I got Delia wondering
where the hell I'm at.

19:39.469 --> 19:41.889
Thinking I'm some douchy asshole
for leaving her hanging.

19:41.972 --> 19:44.349
And what am I supposed to say to her, man?

19:44.433 --> 19:46.560
"Oh, sorry, I got an old pal
I need to kill,

19:46.643 --> 19:48.353
and I'll be back before you know it."

19:53.984 --> 19:55.319
I wish that we could...

19:55.694 --> 19:58.488
We gotta go.
Yeah, we gotta get off this road.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.222
Kid! It's Frank!

20:25.974 --> 20:26.975
Kid!

20:30.187 --> 20:31.021
Shit.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.065
Kid?

20:33.899 --> 20:35.025
Shit.

20:41.531 --> 20:43.700
What are you doing

20:43.784 --> 20:45.327
-Frank!
-You think it's a game?

20:45.410 --> 20:46.662
-No! No!
-How about now?

20:46.745 --> 20:48.830
-Frank!
-Is it a game now?

20:48.914 --> 20:51.333
You feel that

20:51.416 --> 20:52.876
You know how quick it would've been?

20:52.960 --> 20:55.379
That's your head all over that wall!
Just like that!

20:55.462 --> 20:56.421
-Frank!
-That quick!

20:56.505 --> 20:58.215
-I was--
-You what

20:58.298 --> 20:59.841
I was practicing
the move you showed me.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.843
Nah! Bullshit! Bullshit!

21:01.927 --> 21:04.221
Trying to keep you safe.
You're gonna get yourself killed!

21:04.304 --> 21:07.182
You quit your goddamn crying.
God damn it!

21:07.266 --> 21:08.517
Enough!

21:09.476 --> 21:10.852
Be easy, man.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.230
She's just a kid.
You don't have to talk to her like that.

21:13.313 --> 21:17.192
You got her all hemmed up.
You drag her into some insane shit.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.319
And now what? You want her to act normal.

21:19.403 --> 21:21.154
There's no normal around you.

21:23.907 --> 21:25.659
We're not playing games here, Curt.

21:25.742 --> 21:27.661
She needs to know that, so do you.

21:28.245 --> 21:30.706
We make mistakes and people die. They die!

21:30.789 --> 21:32.541
A man died today
because I dropped the ball

21:32.624 --> 21:34.418
and you did, too. Right?

21:34.501 --> 21:36.461
She needs to know
that she could wind up dead.

21:37.587 --> 21:39.965
I think she gets it. You get it, right?

21:41.341 --> 21:42.342
Come on.

21:44.720 --> 21:45.721
It's all good.

21:46.847 --> 21:48.390
Everything is cool.

21:49.683 --> 21:52.811
I get it. She gets it.
We all get it, Frank.

21:52.894 --> 21:55.230
You froze, now it's everyone else's fault.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.816
That right? Give me the keys.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.444
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to find Billy.

22:00.527 --> 22:02.529
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down. Where?

22:02.612 --> 22:04.156
I'm gonna see my boy Jake.

22:04.781 --> 22:05.907
Okay, I'll drive.

22:05.991 --> 22:07.743
Give me the goddamn keys, Curtis.

22:08.869 --> 22:10.579
Are you gonna shoot me if I don't?

22:12.748 --> 22:14.041
Your funeral.

22:14.875 --> 22:15.876
I want to come.

22:15.959 --> 22:16.793
No.

22:16.877 --> 22:19.421
Frank, wait... Please don't go.

22:19.504 --> 22:20.505
Just stay put.

22:21.256 --> 22:23.008
But you're coming back, right?

22:45.572 --> 22:46.823
-Yeah?
-It's me.

22:49.826 --> 22:51.244
You've seen the news, I'm guessing.

22:51.953 --> 22:53.663
-Yeah.
-Yeah, total shitshow.

22:56.249 --> 22:57.834
They said hostages were killed.

22:57.918 --> 23:01.797
Yeah, it's looking like maybe the guy was
part of the whole thing. An inside job.

23:01.880 --> 23:02.881
Another dead guy

23:02.964 --> 23:05.717
used to work for the security company
that delivered the cash.

23:05.801 --> 23:08.011
-You're not hanging around.
-I'm a good cop.

23:08.095 --> 23:10.847
And Russo killed them both
covering his tracks.

23:13.100 --> 23:15.435
I figured you'd make me
do this at Homeland.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.939
Trying to throw your weight around.

23:19.940 --> 23:21.024
But here we are.

23:23.276 --> 23:26.780
Which makes me think
the last thing you want is me at Homeland,

23:26.863 --> 23:29.908
officially talking about you
and Russo and Frank Castle.

23:29.991 --> 23:32.077
Yeah, it's the last thing Homeland wants.

23:33.453 --> 23:35.747
I mean, we're not at the precinct, either,

23:35.831 --> 23:39.835
so... you're not certain
you want to come after me.

23:39.918 --> 23:40.836
Officially.

23:41.503 --> 23:42.504
Not yet.

23:43.880 --> 23:45.173
I've got two questions,

23:45.799 --> 23:47.968
and this seemed the best way
to get 'em answered.

23:48.051 --> 23:51.388
Why'd you tip me to the robbery

23:52.722 --> 23:54.891
Castle's the one who found out
about the robbery.

23:55.475 --> 23:58.520
-Told him to stay away. He didn't listen.
-You're damn right, he didn't listen.

23:58.979 --> 24:01.773
He hit me in the head, and he took my gun.

24:03.442 --> 24:06.194
Yeah, he did the same thing to me,
first time we met.

24:06.278 --> 24:08.655
-I guess I should be glad I'm not dead.
-Oh.

24:08.738 --> 24:11.116
Castle wouldn't kill a cop.

24:12.117 --> 24:13.410
Oh, that right?

24:13.493 --> 24:15.078
Well, has he ever?

24:16.830 --> 24:17.998
Castle's got a code.

24:18.748 --> 24:21.084
"Castle's got a code."

24:22.085 --> 24:24.463
Listen to yourself.

24:25.797 --> 24:27.466
The man is a maniac.

24:29.217 --> 24:31.386
I don't care
how much shit got done to him.

24:31.470 --> 24:34.890
Just the fact that you're talking to him
should cost you your badge.

24:35.849 --> 24:38.351
He's a murderer. You get that, right?

24:39.978 --> 24:41.688
What hell is between you people?

24:42.981 --> 24:44.232
You don't wanna know.

24:46.151 --> 24:47.277
And if you try and find out,

24:47.360 --> 24:50.489
they'll have you running traffic duty
in Rockland for the rest of your career.

24:52.115 --> 24:53.241
Feds, man.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.203
You guys make me sick.

24:56.286 --> 24:58.663
Always covering your asses
and hiding shit.

25:01.208 --> 25:02.209
So...

25:03.293 --> 25:04.669
where does this leave us?

25:06.588 --> 25:08.340
Let's be clear, okay?

25:10.175 --> 25:11.343
We aren't friends.

25:12.010 --> 25:15.514
Or even colleagues with a mutual
beneficial working relationship.

25:16.681 --> 25:20.435
Mostly, you've hidden stuff,
lied and shot me.

25:21.603 --> 25:23.104
Give me some respect, huh?

25:24.022 --> 25:25.815
I know he was at that carousel.

25:26.900 --> 25:29.945
Russo escapes, Castle's back...
You three, 'round and 'round you go.

25:30.028 --> 25:32.364
Let's just say I used to be just like you.

25:32.447 --> 25:34.658
You know, I thought
all we had to do was...

25:36.034 --> 25:39.246
follow the rules, tell the truth,
and justice would be served.

25:39.329 --> 25:40.747
I learned different.

25:41.873 --> 25:46.670
Sometimes, maybe, someone like Castle
is the nearest to justice we can get.

25:49.130 --> 25:50.382
The good news is...

25:52.008 --> 25:55.720
I don't care about whatever nefarious shit
you're caught up in.

25:56.513 --> 25:58.390
I'd just really like my gun back.

26:00.225 --> 26:02.978
And Castle's got a friend, big black guy.

26:03.687 --> 26:04.771
Ring any bells?

26:06.690 --> 26:07.649
No, huh?

26:09.484 --> 26:10.610
I want Castle.

26:11.236 --> 26:12.320
Russo, too.

26:12.988 --> 26:15.323
The reason we're here
and not down at the precinct

26:15.407 --> 26:19.119
is because I think maybe you can
give me them. That's my deal.

26:19.202 --> 26:22.622
-I don't know where they are.
-But I think you can find out.

26:22.706 --> 26:25.166
Because Castle's got you
on speed dial, it seems.

26:27.002 --> 26:28.086
Give him up.

26:29.629 --> 26:33.049
Or next time we'll be doing this
at my place, in handcuffs.

26:35.343 --> 26:37.345
Special agent in charge or not...

26:38.138 --> 26:40.223
you've gotta choose which side you're on.

26:45.395 --> 26:47.314
Do you know how long I've known Frank?

26:49.774 --> 26:51.901
How much shit that we got each other into?

26:53.278 --> 26:54.321
And out of?

26:57.073 --> 27:00.744
I would give my life for that man.
And he knows that.

27:01.286 --> 27:05.165
So why? Why would a man
that I would give my life for try to...

27:06.207 --> 27:08.376
try to take my life from me?

27:10.003 --> 27:12.172
Maybe he was never who you thought he was.

27:17.010 --> 27:18.178
Or maybe I'm not.

27:19.929 --> 27:21.181
Because I just...

27:23.767 --> 27:25.977
I don't remember.

27:27.270 --> 27:28.313
I don't remember.

27:28.897 --> 27:32.901
Do you know how many people I treat
with injuries half as severe as yours?

27:34.235 --> 27:37.155
The majority of them lie in bed
for the rest of their lives.

27:37.781 --> 27:42.661
What was done to you was unfair,
cruel and shitty.

27:42.744 --> 27:44.871
If Frank did this to you,
he did everything he could

27:44.954 --> 27:47.499
to make sure you suffered
for the rest of your life.

27:51.252 --> 27:52.962
It was better when I didn't know.

27:57.133 --> 27:58.718
See, that's where you're wrong.

27:59.552 --> 28:00.595
Because...

28:02.972 --> 28:04.766
now the nightmares end.

28:07.227 --> 28:09.688
There are no more missing pieces
to the puzzle.

28:10.355 --> 28:14.317
A man you trusted beyond all others
tried to destroy you.

28:15.193 --> 28:18.363
And now you understand your pain
and you're gonna work through it.

28:18.446 --> 28:22.659
You can be reborn.
And in that rebirth lies all your power.

28:24.035 --> 28:27.455
I know exactly what you're going through,
because I've been there.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.791
Broken, betrayed.

28:30.625 --> 28:33.336
Nothing but questions and no answers.

28:35.130 --> 28:37.757
But then I came face to face with my hurt,

28:37.841 --> 28:40.593
and I swear to you,
it is like touching God.

28:49.811 --> 28:52.230
I know it doesn't feel like it now...

28:53.398 --> 28:56.151
but this is the best day of your life.

28:59.028 --> 29:00.238
Except that I'm crazy.

29:00.321 --> 29:01.364
You're not crazy.

29:01.448 --> 29:02.532
No...

29:03.366 --> 29:04.367
I am.

29:06.953 --> 29:09.080
But you opened
your front door to me anyway.

29:09.956 --> 29:11.708
Why would you do that to yourself?

29:13.668 --> 29:15.378
Because I hate beginnings.

29:17.005 --> 29:19.340
That awkward false state of everything.

29:20.592 --> 29:23.678
We never had to suffer that, you and I.
We started in the middle,

29:24.262 --> 29:25.513
looking forwards.

29:27.515 --> 29:28.641
I like that.

29:39.027 --> 29:41.112
Where is he

29:41.196 --> 29:42.864
-I don't know--
-That doesn't work.

29:42.947 --> 29:45.784
Billy! Ain't! Worth! Shit!

29:48.411 --> 29:49.954
Where is he

29:50.038 --> 29:51.790
Huh

29:53.541 --> 29:55.543
Frank, what the hell's wrong with you?

29:55.627 --> 29:57.337
Look at yourself, Frank!

29:58.213 --> 30:00.465
Frank! Look at yourself.

30:00.548 --> 30:01.758
I mean, look at us.

30:02.509 --> 30:04.677
We can't do this anymore!

30:05.595 --> 30:07.305
You're acting just like Billy.

30:08.431 --> 30:09.474
What'd you say?

30:10.558 --> 30:11.559
You just...

30:14.479 --> 30:16.272
Come on, Jake. Stay alive.

30:16.356 --> 30:18.691
Keep breathing with me now.
Stay with me. Keep breathing.

30:19.567 --> 30:20.860
We're not the same.

30:23.196 --> 30:25.198
Frank. Look at yourself.

30:25.782 --> 30:26.741
I mean, look at us.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.535
Guys like us, Frank, we need this!

30:29.410 --> 30:30.662
It's all we're good for.

30:34.374 --> 30:36.751
We can't do this anymore!

30:38.545 --> 30:41.881
Just a couple of assholes, who thought
we could have the good things in life.

30:46.302 --> 30:50.515
We are not good people, Frank.
We never were!

30:55.103 --> 30:57.981
Me and you, Frankie, we're the same.

31:01.568 --> 31:02.694
We're the same.

31:33.933 --> 31:35.351
You almost had me.

31:36.311 --> 31:39.814
Letting me in.
Protecting me from the world.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.232
Trying to make me better.

31:42.275 --> 31:44.235
You played me, Krista.

31:46.029 --> 31:47.071
So well.

31:48.698 --> 31:49.699
You knew.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.662
You knew. It was all in my file.

31:55.371 --> 31:58.625
But now I know. It all makes sense.

31:58.708 --> 32:03.588
Frank is the big secret
that you've all been keeping from me.

32:05.006 --> 32:08.384
-Frank wasn't mentioned in your file.
-Yeah, you knew I'd read it.

32:09.427 --> 32:11.846
You'd be dumb not to think so.
And you're not dumb, are you?

32:11.930 --> 32:15.099
So you hid it. Why

32:15.850 --> 32:17.977
So you could play God with me?

32:18.561 --> 32:21.022
I didn't take anything out of your file.

32:21.105 --> 32:22.774
I'm not playing you. I'm here.

32:22.857 --> 32:25.485
You're here? They were all here.

32:26.069 --> 32:29.614
And they all let me in,
but they never let me in!

32:29.697 --> 32:30.823
Do you understand me?

32:30.907 --> 32:34.285
If I can't trust Frank,
I can't trust anybody!

32:35.870 --> 32:38.081
How

32:38.164 --> 32:40.792
Five blue things.
Count five blue things in the room.

32:44.128 --> 32:45.838
Is that blue

32:46.881 --> 32:48.132
Is that blue?

32:48.216 --> 32:49.676
I think it's blue!

32:49.759 --> 32:51.260
Billy, please!

32:54.222 --> 32:56.099
-Billy--
-Are those blue

33:01.479 --> 33:02.772
This looks blue.

33:09.070 --> 33:10.613
You are all the same!

33:10.697 --> 33:11.990
You're all the same!

33:12.073 --> 33:13.324
Stop. Stop!

33:19.998 --> 33:21.541
Don't, please.

33:23.793 --> 33:25.920
Oh, God! Come on.

33:29.632 --> 33:30.842
Please, please...

33:30.925 --> 33:31.801
Billy.

33:32.343 --> 33:33.469
Billy.

33:35.555 --> 33:37.306
-How does that feel, huh?

33:37.390 --> 33:38.474
How does that feel?

33:39.183 --> 33:41.978
Something that you hate,
something that scares you,

33:42.061 --> 33:44.564
and somebody just keeps pushing
and pushing,

33:44.647 --> 33:47.358
and making you feel
the last thing you want to feel!

33:50.737 --> 33:53.865
Maybe everybody wants to make
somebody feel worse than they do.

33:57.285 --> 33:59.662
Maybe everybody gets betrayed in the end.

34:01.998 --> 34:03.958
Do you think it's so scary to think...

34:05.668 --> 34:07.628
that I might have love for you?

34:15.094 --> 34:17.180
To think that maybe you could change?

34:22.101 --> 34:23.686
Billy, I would never hurt you.

34:24.937 --> 34:28.858
And I would never betray you.
And I have never ever lied to you.

34:35.782 --> 34:37.867
This is not a lesser you.

34:39.285 --> 34:40.828
It's a better you.

34:41.746 --> 34:44.957
There's nothing left to hurt you,
and here you stand.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.336
But you have to choose.

34:54.884 --> 34:56.302
You think it's so easy?

34:56.969 --> 34:58.346
I know it isn't.

35:43.641 --> 35:45.560
Shit!

35:45.643 --> 35:48.312
Hey, it's me, kid! Curtis! God damn it!

35:57.572 --> 35:59.740
-What the hell were you thinking?
-Frank told me--

35:59.824 --> 36:01.117
Yeah, of course he did.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.452
It makes so much damn sense!
You could've cut me in half.

36:03.536 --> 36:06.414
Yeah, well, you could've told me
you were coming.

36:06.497 --> 36:08.457
I'd rather be safe than sorry.

36:08.541 --> 36:09.542
Where is Frank?

36:10.751 --> 36:11.627
Is he coming back?

36:11.711 --> 36:13.671
Nobody knows what Frank is doing
except Frank.

36:13.754 --> 36:15.756
And he doesn't give a damn
what anybody else thinks.

36:19.510 --> 36:20.511
So...

36:21.470 --> 36:22.805
Curtis.

36:22.889 --> 36:26.017
We were never,
you know, properly introduced.

36:26.100 --> 36:28.769
And you're Amy. I heard so much about you.

36:28.853 --> 36:31.856
Not about the part with the shotgun.
That would've been useful!

36:34.358 --> 36:37.069
Well, I'm making something to eat
if you're hungry.

36:38.988 --> 36:41.407
First you wanna kill me,
now you wanna feed me?

36:41.490 --> 36:44.327
Yeah, it might be the same thing.
I'm not much of a cook.

37:00.301 --> 37:01.344
It's all there.

37:01.928 --> 37:03.095
I didn't take a dollar.

37:04.972 --> 37:06.015
Help yourselves.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.742
Scraps.

37:27.912 --> 37:28.913
This...

37:29.622 --> 37:33.000
this is just... scraps.

37:35.044 --> 37:36.545
Is that all that you want?

37:38.130 --> 37:40.508
Because if it is,
you should probably just leave now,

37:40.591 --> 37:42.301
and don't bother coming back.

37:42.385 --> 37:43.386
But...

37:45.179 --> 37:49.141
if you think that you deserve more...

37:51.894 --> 37:52.895
hey...

37:54.647 --> 37:56.607
maybe then you're in the right place.

38:03.030 --> 38:04.156
Ask yourself...

38:04.949 --> 38:09.495
are you willing to be a part of something
bigger than just yourselves?

38:10.997 --> 38:12.248
Bobby didn't get that.

38:13.165 --> 38:14.875
Made it all about himself.

38:16.794 --> 38:18.713
But if you think, just for a second...

38:19.880 --> 38:24.635
about what we could achieve
if we all work together...

38:29.515 --> 38:32.685
Hey, look, if you're happy picking up
a few bucks here and there

38:32.768 --> 38:36.981
like common street thugs,
then... go ahead,

38:37.064 --> 38:40.234
grab what's yours and get out,
'cause I don't have anything else for you.

38:41.694 --> 38:42.695
Or...

38:46.073 --> 38:47.491
we invest this money.

38:48.367 --> 38:51.037
In weapons, in people.

38:52.330 --> 38:55.875
We go and we find all those guys
who we know are just like us,

38:55.958 --> 38:57.877
and we offer them a piece of the same.

39:01.088 --> 39:02.548
What are you talking about?

39:02.631 --> 39:07.053
I'm talking about today...
times a hundred.

39:07.845 --> 39:09.972
I am talking about an army, not a gang!

39:10.056 --> 39:11.974
I am talking about a brotherhood.

39:12.058 --> 39:14.727
I am talking about not taking
any more shit!

39:14.810 --> 39:16.062
From anyone!

39:20.566 --> 39:25.029
Enough of us fighting for each other...

39:31.494 --> 39:32.912
we could be gods.

39:42.755 --> 39:43.839
Mmm.

39:45.091 --> 39:46.717
This is some good-ass spaghetti.

39:46.801 --> 39:50.805
Boiled it for six minutes,
just like the packet said.

39:50.888 --> 39:53.599
Well, it's good.
And I haven't eaten all day.

39:54.350 --> 39:56.268
And it's been a long day.

40:02.066 --> 40:03.067
Are you okay?

40:05.736 --> 40:07.321
He's an a-hole.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.657
Mos def.

40:11.867 --> 40:14.995
But I don't think he meant
those things he said to you.

40:16.664 --> 40:18.916
You scared him.
Because he thought he hurt you.

40:18.999 --> 40:21.585
He nearly shot me
'cause he cares about me?

40:23.087 --> 40:26.882
Yeah, that's the Frank I know.
Very touchy-feely.

40:26.966 --> 40:31.178
Well, I've known Frank for a long time,
and there's one thing for sure,

40:31.929 --> 40:33.222
-he cares about you.

40:33.848 --> 40:35.182
Yeah, right.

40:35.266 --> 40:36.600
He's not like most people.

40:36.684 --> 40:39.311
He doesn't want to feel for you,
because he's scared of getting hurt.

40:41.439 --> 40:45.985
And he'd rather stay mad at the world
than risk being a part of it.

40:50.489 --> 40:52.283
So, you two...

40:52.950 --> 40:54.368
You two met in the army?

40:55.161 --> 40:58.497
He was a marine,
and I was a navy corpsman.

40:59.457 --> 41:00.416
A medic.

41:00.499 --> 41:03.627
Well, he definitely must care
a lot about you, too.

41:04.545 --> 41:07.923
'Cause you're the only other person
I've met that's stood up to Frank

41:08.007 --> 41:08.966
and didn't get killed.

41:09.049 --> 41:11.135
-Ha!

41:11.218 --> 41:14.096
You and this Billy guy, maybe.

41:21.270 --> 41:24.899
He was one of the ones
that killed Frank's family, wasn't he?

41:25.649 --> 41:26.650
Yeah.

41:27.359 --> 41:28.694
The worst one.

41:29.904 --> 41:31.614
Because they were his family, too.

41:40.956 --> 41:42.041
Curtis?

41:42.124 --> 41:44.084
Curtis Hoyle, it's Dinah Madani.

41:45.127 --> 41:47.713
Oh, God. What's she doing here?

41:50.925 --> 41:51.967
Come on.

41:55.930 --> 41:56.764
Whoa!

41:58.641 --> 41:59.808
Is she for real?

41:59.892 --> 42:01.685
Oh, you best believe she is.

42:07.149 --> 42:09.818
That's a dangerous weapon, you know?
You could have shot me.

42:10.903 --> 42:13.155
Nope. Couldn't.

42:13.239 --> 42:14.532
Forgot to reload it.

42:15.908 --> 42:19.036
Well, I'm sorry to interrupt
your cozy little dinner.

42:19.119 --> 42:20.371
You want a plate?

42:21.205 --> 42:22.248
No, thank you.

42:24.166 --> 42:26.752
By the way, I met your friend,
the man in black.

42:27.878 --> 42:29.463
Did you arrest him?

42:30.089 --> 42:31.465
For what, exactly?

42:35.386 --> 42:36.971
Yeah. That's what I thought.

42:38.222 --> 42:39.640
Soon enough, you, me and Frank

42:39.723 --> 42:41.850
are gonna have to have
a conversation about that.

42:43.143 --> 42:44.728
Talking of which, where is he?

42:47.856 --> 42:49.316
How did you find us?

42:49.400 --> 42:52.236
You left your phone on, Curtis.
I tracked it.

42:52.319 --> 42:55.990
Dude. Seriously? It's, like, 101.

42:59.618 --> 43:01.203
I had a conversation with a cop

43:01.287 --> 43:04.081
who's really interested in knowing
who Frank's buddy might be.

43:05.374 --> 43:08.002
It won't take him long
to come looking for you, either.

43:08.669 --> 43:09.670
I knew it.

43:15.801 --> 43:16.969
Where is Frank, Curtis?

43:17.928 --> 43:22.016
You tell me where he is, maybe I can pull
your ass out of the fire with the NYPD.

43:22.099 --> 43:26.770
If we hand Mahoney Billy,
then maybe he lets the rest slide.

43:27.354 --> 43:28.522
And what about Frank?

43:29.607 --> 43:32.568
We're just gonna hand him over, too

43:34.111 --> 43:36.572
You know, I told you both
to leave it alone.

43:36.655 --> 43:40.618
Well, I don't know where he is.
He went crazy after he missed Billy.

43:41.285 --> 43:43.162
Yeah, sounds about right.

43:45.205 --> 43:48.417
Uh... Have you got
anything to drink, at least?

44:04.808 --> 44:07.102
This is seriously messed up.

44:07.645 --> 44:09.438
I would have been fine on my own,

44:09.521 --> 44:14.652
but he gave me this stupid speech
about how we needed to finish our fight,

44:14.735 --> 44:17.946
and then he leaves me
to go after this Billy guy and...

44:18.030 --> 44:19.031
Thank you.

44:19.114 --> 44:24.662
...now he's off doing whatever,
and I'm here, making spaghetti.

44:39.635 --> 44:42.763
Yesterday, I was a guy selling insurance.

44:44.390 --> 44:45.891
I just want my old life back.

44:46.850 --> 44:48.185
Amen to that.

45:00.406 --> 45:01.448
To Frank.

45:14.586 --> 45:16.004
So, um...

45:18.424 --> 45:20.134
are you going to give him up?

45:21.260 --> 45:24.221
I guess that's what we're all sitting here
waiting to find out.
