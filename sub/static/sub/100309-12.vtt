00:00.180 --> 00:02.100
Previously on "Manifest"...

00:02.100 --> 00:04.520
Police! Hands where I can
see them! Down on the ground!

00:04.520 --> 00:06.100
The pain I'll bring
down on you,

00:06.100 --> 00:08.190
a holy vengeance like nothing
you've ever seen.

00:08.190 --> 00:09.810
Let him go.

00:09.810 --> 00:12.900
At the bust, I got a Calling
that told me to "let him go."

00:12.900 --> 00:14.240
And I didn't.

00:14.240 --> 00:15.900
I've never defied
a Calling before.

00:15.900 --> 00:17.780
I think you made
the right choice.

00:17.780 --> 00:19.200
Zeke, what is this?

00:19.200 --> 00:21.370
Frostbite.
I may be freezing to death.

00:21.370 --> 00:22.620
Saanvi thinks she can help.

00:22.620 --> 00:24.080
I'm sorry, Dr. Bahl,

00:24.080 --> 00:25.540
but I'm afraid we have
to ask you to leave.

00:25.540 --> 00:27.120
Who authorized this?!

00:27.120 --> 00:32.380
Will you marry me,
Michaela?

00:32.380 --> 00:36.050
Yes. Yes, I will.

00:36.050 --> 00:37.130
What's this one?

00:37.130 --> 00:38.800
It was the first one
I ever drew,

00:38.800 --> 00:40.850
and I actually never
figured out what it meant.

00:52.950 --> 00:55.490
Michaela: Am I supposed
to be scared of you?

00:57.790 --> 00:59.830
'Cause staring daggers at me
doesn't change the fact

00:59.830 --> 01:02.380
that we found
over $1 million worth of meth

01:02.380 --> 01:04.790
in your place, Jace.

01:04.790 --> 01:06.920
I'm just thinking
about the best way.

01:08.960 --> 01:09.970
The best way to what?

01:09.970 --> 01:11.630
To hurt you the most.

01:11.630 --> 01:13.510
You see, I don't forgive.

01:13.510 --> 01:16.010
And I don't forget.

01:16.010 --> 01:19.140
I get not turning
on your little brother.

01:19.140 --> 01:21.480
But, I mean, Kory?

01:21.480 --> 01:25.110
I mean...
why'd he even keep you around?

01:25.110 --> 01:29.360
You're a liability,
slab of meat with a temper.

01:29.360 --> 01:31.950
At least that's
what he said.

01:31.950 --> 01:33.700
I'm sorry.
What did you just say?

01:33.700 --> 01:35.450
You're telling me you're not
the mastermind behind all this?

01:35.450 --> 01:37.490
You have a vivid imagination,
detective.

01:37.490 --> 01:38.740
I'm just a bus driver.

01:38.740 --> 01:40.790
Oh, you wanna play dumb?

01:40.790 --> 01:42.620
Oh.
Well, fine by me.

01:42.620 --> 01:44.170
I mean, you're gonna go
to prison for so long

01:44.170 --> 01:45.840
you're gonna forget what a bus
actually looks like,

01:45.840 --> 01:47.750
much less drive one.

01:47.750 --> 01:49.380
Or...

01:49.380 --> 01:50.840
you can tell me what you know
about your partners,

01:50.840 --> 01:52.430
and we can cut a deal.

01:52.430 --> 01:54.640
But I don't know anything!

01:54.640 --> 01:56.300
Drea: I know
you're scared.

01:56.300 --> 01:59.600
And I know you've had
a clean sheet up until now.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.100
So, what?

02:01.100 --> 02:03.850
So, I want to help you.

02:03.850 --> 02:05.520
But you need
to help me first.

02:12.780 --> 02:14.490
I can't.

02:18.080 --> 02:19.450
Three for three.

02:19.450 --> 02:20.830
Looks like
no one's caving tonight.

02:20.830 --> 02:22.910
Nope.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.540
You alright?
No, of course not.

02:24.540 --> 02:26.630
I mean, you've seen the way
that these cases play out.

02:26.630 --> 02:28.590
Separate trials,
different defense attorneys

02:28.590 --> 02:30.250
all claiming that their client
doesn't know anything

02:30.250 --> 02:33.300
while pointing at an empty chair
creates reasonable doubt.

02:33.300 --> 02:34.930
They all walk.

02:34.930 --> 02:37.640
That all
that's bugging you?

02:37.640 --> 02:42.100
The way that Jace looks at me,
the way that he talks to me,

02:42.100 --> 02:44.640
it's like he can see
right through me.

02:44.640 --> 02:46.600
It's like he knows that --
You think...

02:46.600 --> 02:48.520
it's connected
to the Calling?

02:48.520 --> 02:50.780
"Let him go"?
I don't know.

02:50.780 --> 02:52.860
Well, let's let 'em
sweat it out overnight.

02:52.860 --> 02:54.240
We'll take another stab at them
in the morning

02:54.240 --> 02:55.700
before they get
on the bus to Rikers.

02:55.700 --> 02:58.820
Um, yeah, small problem.
I'm -- I'm not available.

02:58.820 --> 03:00.490
What?

03:00.490 --> 03:02.870
You were all fired up,
wanting answers.

03:02.870 --> 03:04.210
Where do you have to be
that's more important?

03:04.210 --> 03:06.120
I'm getting married.

03:15.720 --> 03:17.640
Wow.

03:20.680 --> 03:22.350
Tomorrow?

03:22.350 --> 03:25.350
Zeke's dying, J.
He's got two days left.

03:25.350 --> 03:27.690
I shouldn't even be here,
but I can't help but feel

03:27.690 --> 03:30.190
like Jace knows
something --

03:30.190 --> 03:33.980
something that could
help save Zeke.

03:33.980 --> 03:35.740
I'm sorry, Mick.

03:35.740 --> 03:38.450
He wants
a final celebration,

03:38.450 --> 03:43.450
instead of being hooked up
to the machines at the hospital.

03:43.450 --> 03:45.160
Look, I'm --
I'm sorry. I --

03:45.160 --> 03:47.160
The last thing that I want to do
is cause you pain.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.920
Grace asked if I wanted
to invite you.

03:48.920 --> 03:50.750
I told her
I didn't even want to tell you,

03:50.750 --> 03:53.800
let alone have you stand there
at --
Mick, Mick, Mick, Mick.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.510
It's okay.

03:57.590 --> 03:59.220
I'll be there.

04:02.760 --> 04:05.390
What can I do?

04:08.730 --> 04:10.860
Get me a conviction.

04:15.480 --> 04:16.940
Michaela:
Whatcha watching?

04:16.940 --> 04:20.110
Aah!
You snuck up on me!

04:20.110 --> 04:22.490
Sorry.
You wanted me to drop by.

04:22.490 --> 04:24.910
Early wedding present.

04:24.910 --> 04:28.210
I had to crawl through the attic
to find this.

04:28.210 --> 04:29.710
Karen:
Hey, you got it?

04:29.710 --> 04:32.250
Wow!
Look at that, Daddy!

04:32.250 --> 04:34.800
Steve: Look at the camera,
Michaela. Big smile!

04:34.800 --> 04:36.460
There you go!

04:36.460 --> 04:39.800
Isn't she beautiful?
Look at you!

04:42.300 --> 04:44.390
Oh!
Isn't she great, daddy?

04:44.390 --> 04:45.600
Okay, you ready?

04:45.600 --> 04:47.140
Here we go.

04:51.230 --> 04:53.730
Show daddy
how beautiful you are.

04:53.730 --> 04:55.190
You're my girl.

05:03.410 --> 05:05.240
You should wear
mom's dress.

05:05.240 --> 05:07.830
Or veil.
At least, you know,

05:07.830 --> 05:09.750
a part of her will
be with you in spirit.

05:09.750 --> 05:11.580
Yeah, I thought
about that, um...

05:11.580 --> 05:16.170
but dad got rid of all her stuff
when she died.

05:16.170 --> 05:19.800
Guess the memories
were too much.

05:19.800 --> 05:22.680
Kind of like how this might
be too much for me.

05:22.680 --> 05:24.390
I guess I --

05:24.390 --> 05:25.930
I didn't fully process
that saying yes

05:25.930 --> 05:28.520
meant letting him pull the plug
on his own life.

05:28.520 --> 05:30.140
Why does it have
to mean that?

05:30.140 --> 05:31.810
'Cause that's what he wants.
I mean, he --

05:31.810 --> 05:33.560
If I call off the weeding

05:33.560 --> 05:35.020
and force him back
into the hospital,

05:35.020 --> 05:37.570
he will never
forgive me.

05:41.200 --> 05:43.110
She'd know what to do.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.040
Dr. Cardoso!

06:36.040 --> 06:38.170
I need to get into my lab.
My research is in there.

06:38.170 --> 06:39.420
You need to reinstate me.

06:39.420 --> 06:40.630
I can't discuss this.
I'm sorry.

06:40.630 --> 06:42.510
Please.
I'm begging you.

06:42.510 --> 06:44.720
There are gravely ill patients
who I need to treat

06:44.720 --> 06:46.470
who will die without
my intervention.

06:46.470 --> 06:48.100
Do you want
their blood on your hands?

06:48.100 --> 06:49.640
I want to help you,
Saanvi. I do.

06:49.640 --> 06:52.520
So, believe me when I say,
the decision to fire you

06:52.520 --> 06:54.270
was made by people
well above my pay grade.

06:54.270 --> 06:55.520
But you're the chair
of the department.

06:55.520 --> 06:57.150
I can't revoke
people's licenses.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.570
Only the NIH
can do that.

06:59.570 --> 07:00.860
Is there anyone
in the government

07:00.860 --> 07:03.360
who has a reason
to shut you down?

07:29.550 --> 07:31.010
Karen: Michaela Beth...

07:31.010 --> 07:32.930
even people that
have made mistakes

07:32.930 --> 07:34.140
deserve happiness.

07:35.390 --> 07:37.900
You know
my favorite verse --

07:37.900 --> 07:40.190
"All things work together
for good."

07:40.190 --> 07:41.690
Couldn't sleep?

07:41.690 --> 07:43.820
I've already got you beat
on the cold feet.

07:43.820 --> 07:45.360
It's a big day.

07:45.360 --> 07:46.950
There's lots
to think about.

07:46.950 --> 07:48.160
Yeah.

07:55.370 --> 07:58.710
Your going through with this
means the world to me.

07:58.710 --> 08:02.170
Having our families together,
celebrating us --

08:02.170 --> 08:03.750
that's the memory
I want to hold onto.

08:03.750 --> 08:06.010
You get that, right?

08:06.010 --> 08:07.590
I do, but...

08:07.590 --> 08:10.340
you can have all of that

08:10.340 --> 08:13.060
and still do
a quick round of treatments.

08:14.930 --> 08:17.980
No more meds.
No more needles.

08:17.980 --> 08:20.480
Just an epic wedding,
a honeymoon,

08:20.480 --> 08:23.190
and a last night
in your arms.

08:30.070 --> 08:32.280
Do you have any idea where
your mom keeps the sheet pans?

08:32.280 --> 08:34.580
Not since my dad turned
our entire garage

08:34.580 --> 08:36.450
into the Upside Down.

08:38.120 --> 08:41.670
I'm gonna look
over here.

08:41.670 --> 08:43.840
So, uh...
winter break's coming up,

08:43.840 --> 08:47.460
and I was wondering
if you wanted to go skiing.

08:47.460 --> 08:50.010
Oh, uh...I'm not
really into skiing.

08:50.010 --> 08:52.930
Okay, well, I'm open
to any other ideas.

08:52.930 --> 08:54.720
Yeah, maybe we can talk
about this later.

08:54.720 --> 08:56.180
I'm sorry.

08:56.180 --> 08:58.640
It's just hard to focus
with the wedding

08:58.640 --> 09:00.310
and finals.

09:03.060 --> 09:04.860
Found them.

09:10.240 --> 09:11.570
The bride and groom!

09:11.570 --> 09:13.200
Hi, you guys.

09:13.200 --> 09:14.660
Come on in.

09:14.660 --> 09:15.740
Thank you.

09:19.120 --> 09:21.040
So...

09:21.040 --> 09:24.250
Team Stone has been
full steam ahead.

09:24.250 --> 09:27.420
I've got all the mushroom puffs,
blinis, and tartlets

09:27.420 --> 09:29.260
your little hearts
could desire.

09:29.260 --> 09:32.550
And Ben has been
in construction mode...
Oh.

09:32.550 --> 09:34.340
...since the crack of dawn.
Yeah, no, of course he has.

09:34.340 --> 09:36.470
I mean, has the protractor
come out?

09:43.900 --> 09:44.940
Hey, bud.

09:44.940 --> 09:46.400
How's it going?

09:46.400 --> 09:47.650
Good.

09:56.490 --> 09:58.490
I'm getting a Calling.

09:58.490 --> 10:01.160
Cal is lying
his butt off.

10:02.960 --> 10:07.000
Talk to me.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.590
I thought weddings
were supposed to be fun,

10:09.590 --> 10:12.130
but what's fun
about...

10:13.930 --> 10:15.510
Me dying?

10:15.510 --> 10:17.800
Yeah.

10:17.800 --> 10:19.220
But hey...

10:19.220 --> 10:20.890
we still have
some time together.

10:20.890 --> 10:22.480
And we haven't even done
the best part

10:22.480 --> 10:24.980
of planning a wedding --
the bachelor party.

10:24.980 --> 10:26.770
Seriously?

10:26.770 --> 10:28.440
You're my best man.

10:28.440 --> 10:30.900
You gotta throw me
a killer party.

10:30.900 --> 10:32.570
You in?

10:37.910 --> 10:39.080
Looks pretty good, huh?

10:39.080 --> 10:41.200
Uh...yeah.

10:41.200 --> 10:42.700
Your dad's
coming to the rescue.

10:42.700 --> 10:44.160
Don't worry.
Okay.

10:44.160 --> 10:46.330
Yeah, it's gonna
look great once we...

10:51.670 --> 10:53.800
Ben? Ben?!

10:53.800 --> 10:55.260
Hey, you okay?

10:57.340 --> 10:58.850
No.

10:58.850 --> 11:01.600
Flight 828 --
It...

11:01.600 --> 11:04.770
It just...
blew up all over again.

11:08.400 --> 11:11.190
What's the plane blowing up
supposed to mean?

11:11.190 --> 11:13.440
It's gotta be a sign.
The question is, of what?

11:13.440 --> 11:15.110
I mean,
you said it yourself.

11:15.110 --> 11:16.950
Maybe the Callings are trying
to teach us something.

11:16.950 --> 11:18.660
Why else would you get a vision
of the plane

11:18.660 --> 11:20.370
right before
Zeke's Death Date?

11:21.700 --> 11:24.160
But Zeke wasn't
on the plane, Mick.

11:24.160 --> 11:26.420
I-I think you're grasping.
Ben, for months,
you've been saying

11:26.420 --> 11:28.130
that our only hope
of surviving the Death Date

11:28.130 --> 11:29.750
is by following
these Callings.

11:29.750 --> 11:31.710
I know, okay?
I know it's a long shot,

11:31.710 --> 11:33.260
but if there's any way
of saving Zeke,

11:33.260 --> 11:36.300
you got to figure out
what it means.

11:36.300 --> 11:37.550
Alright.

11:37.550 --> 11:38.890
I'll drive out
to the airport.

11:38.890 --> 11:40.800
I'll see if there's
maybe something

11:40.800 --> 11:42.430
at the explosion site.

11:42.430 --> 11:44.470
Just please be back in time
for the wedding.

11:44.470 --> 11:46.730
Promise.
I'll be there.

11:46.730 --> 11:47.850
Thank you.

11:51.060 --> 11:52.860
Ohh!
After the sugar rush

11:52.860 --> 11:55.030
comes the sugar crash.

11:55.030 --> 11:56.570
I'm gonna
need a nap.

11:56.570 --> 11:58.240
We're not done yet.

12:02.580 --> 12:03.950
Monopoly?

12:03.950 --> 12:05.660
Haven't played
this in ages.

12:05.660 --> 12:07.910
I don't know if we have time,
though, bud.

12:07.910 --> 12:09.880
We should -- We should probably
get downstairs and help set up.

12:09.880 --> 12:12.170
How many more chances
are you gonna have to play?

12:12.170 --> 12:13.420
Alright.

12:13.420 --> 12:14.800
Let's go.

12:18.470 --> 12:19.760
Do you think there
might be a way for you

12:19.760 --> 12:20.930
to beat the Death Date?

12:20.930 --> 12:22.720
I don't know.

12:22.720 --> 12:24.180
What do you think?

12:24.180 --> 12:26.850
Well...
before the plane disappeared,

12:26.850 --> 12:28.440
no one thought
I could beat cancer,

12:28.440 --> 12:31.360
but here I am.

12:31.360 --> 12:33.400
True.

12:33.400 --> 12:35.480
Somehow I think this
is a little bit different.

12:47.750 --> 12:49.620
You threw me
the best bachelor party

12:49.620 --> 12:51.080
I could ask for.

12:53.420 --> 12:55.880
Too bad I'm gonna have
to crush you at Monopoly.

12:55.880 --> 12:57.670
You think
you're gonna beat me?

12:57.670 --> 12:59.340
Please!

12:59.340 --> 13:02.970
I call the race car.

13:02.970 --> 13:04.510
Reporter: This is
certainly an unusual case.

13:04.510 --> 13:06.180
In fact,
the Chief of Police told us

13:06.180 --> 13:07.890
he'd never seen
anything like it...
Hey.

13:07.890 --> 13:09.230
...in all his years
on the force.
Hey.

13:09.230 --> 13:10.980
How can I --
In the wake of NYPD

13:10.980 --> 13:13.110
arresting three suspected
drug dealers

13:13.110 --> 13:16.440
in possession of over
$1 million in methamphetamine,

13:16.440 --> 13:19.780
the story took a shocking turn
when their cook house exploded.

13:19.780 --> 13:21.320
According to some
local eyewitnesses...
That's not possible.

13:21.320 --> 13:22.740
...the debris shattered...

13:25.330 --> 13:27.290
Uh, definitely suspicious.
Michaela: How could it blow up?

13:27.290 --> 13:28.830
HAZMAT came in and cleaned up
all the chemicals.

13:28.830 --> 13:30.210
The apartment was empty.

13:30.210 --> 13:33.580
Unless...
"Let him go."

13:33.580 --> 13:36.170
You think the Calling has
something to do with this?
I never understood

13:36.170 --> 13:37.840
why it didn't want me
to arrest the dealers,

13:37.840 --> 13:39.670
but what if the Callings
wanted them in that lab?

13:39.670 --> 13:40.920
What if they were
supposed to die?

13:40.920 --> 13:42.180
Mick, that'd be some
serious retribution.

13:42.180 --> 13:43.590
More likely,
one of these guys,

13:43.590 --> 13:44.850
or someone above them
in the food chain,

13:44.850 --> 13:46.010
had their hand
in the explosion.

13:46.010 --> 13:47.810
You know, a cover up.

13:47.810 --> 13:49.680
I'll take
one more stab at them.

13:49.680 --> 13:51.350
Thanks.

13:53.150 --> 13:55.190
Jared?

13:55.190 --> 13:56.270
Hey, what are
you doing?

13:56.270 --> 13:57.320
I promised Mick.

13:57.320 --> 13:59.730
Hey!

13:59.730 --> 14:00.780
How'd you do it?

14:00.780 --> 14:03.280
Do what?

14:03.280 --> 14:05.820
Empty cook houses don't blow up
for no reason.

14:05.820 --> 14:07.950
Arson on a crowded block
like yours?

14:07.950 --> 14:10.000
That's attempted murder.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.330
I'm guessing your buddies
are not gonna think twice
about cutting a deal.

14:12.330 --> 14:14.500
They're more afraid of me than
they are dying in the joint.

14:14.500 --> 14:15.920
You should be, too.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.840
Once we're out,
I'll be coming for you,

14:17.840 --> 14:20.670
right after I pay a visit to
your little blonde girlfriend.

14:20.670 --> 14:23.130
Drea: Hey! Hey!
Knock it off!

14:23.130 --> 14:25.640
Always got the ladies helping
you out, huh, detective?

14:26.600 --> 14:29.100
Forget him.

15:02.420 --> 15:05.380
Ward.

15:05.380 --> 15:06.430
Ward Attwood?

15:06.430 --> 15:08.680
Hey, wait up.

15:08.680 --> 15:11.220
My name is Ben Stone.
I was on the flight with you.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.190
I've been trying to find you
since we returned.

15:15.190 --> 15:16.730
I was hoping
we could talk.

15:16.730 --> 15:18.190
I know exactly
what you want to talk about.

15:18.190 --> 15:20.070
And...

15:20.070 --> 15:21.570
I'm sorry.

15:21.570 --> 15:23.070
It's all my fault.

15:23.070 --> 15:24.690
Wait.
What's your fault?

15:24.690 --> 15:26.240
I'm the one who
okayed the flight

15:26.240 --> 15:27.740
to take off from Jamaica.

15:27.740 --> 15:30.280
I rushed my inspection.

15:30.280 --> 15:31.910
I missed something.

15:31.910 --> 15:33.790
Foreign object debris
in the compressor blades,

15:33.790 --> 15:35.330
contaminants
in the fuel.

15:35.330 --> 15:37.080
All I was thinking about
was hopping the jump seat

15:37.080 --> 15:38.210
to get home.

15:38.210 --> 15:40.090
But we landed.
We're safe.

15:40.090 --> 15:42.130
So why the hell
am I being haunted

15:42.130 --> 15:45.130
by visions
of the flight exploding?

15:45.130 --> 15:47.180
You saw it, too.

15:47.180 --> 15:49.930
What do you mean?
You saw it?

15:51.300 --> 15:53.680
It happens to a lot
of passengers.

15:53.680 --> 15:56.060
Ward, I-I've been
where you are.

15:56.060 --> 15:57.190
I know what
you're going through.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.310
You can't.

15:58.310 --> 16:00.810
I haven't worked, slept.

16:00.810 --> 16:04.780
And every time I hear about
a passenger in trouble, dying...

16:04.780 --> 16:06.610
I know it's my fault.

16:06.610 --> 16:08.780
The visions never end.

16:08.780 --> 16:10.780
That's why I'm here.

16:10.780 --> 16:13.490
I've got to figure out
what went wrong.

16:13.490 --> 16:16.080
That vision --
It brought me here today,

16:16.080 --> 16:17.790
to you.

16:17.790 --> 16:20.420
I think we're supposed
to figure it out together.

16:23.130 --> 16:26.340
Priscilla: I know
it's not your mom's, but, um...

16:26.340 --> 16:29.050
I figured
"something borrowed."

16:29.050 --> 16:30.890
Priscilla,
this is beautiful.

16:30.890 --> 16:32.050
Um...

16:32.050 --> 16:34.810
thank you so much.
Your welcome.

16:34.810 --> 16:36.220
There you are.

16:36.220 --> 16:38.100
Come.

16:38.100 --> 16:40.060
I want a photo
with the bride and groom.

16:40.060 --> 16:41.480
Hey.

16:41.480 --> 16:42.690
Oh, Mom,
there'll be plenty of time

16:42.690 --> 16:44.110
to take photos
at the wedding.

16:44.110 --> 16:46.990
Zeke, I love you,

16:46.990 --> 16:50.660
and I'm so happy
for you and Michaela.

16:50.660 --> 16:52.410
Truly.

16:52.410 --> 16:54.780
But with
your father coming,

16:54.780 --> 16:56.700
I...

16:56.700 --> 16:59.620
I can't attend
the wedding.
What?

16:59.620 --> 17:01.500
What he did to you...

17:01.500 --> 17:04.130
and to me
after Chloe died,

17:04.130 --> 17:05.460
I...

17:05.460 --> 17:07.340
I will not be
in the same room with him.

17:07.340 --> 17:08.720
Mom, you have to come.

17:08.720 --> 17:10.430
This is your one chance
to see me get married.

17:10.430 --> 17:13.850
No, there'll be
so many other milestones

17:13.850 --> 17:17.310
for us to celebrate
together.

17:21.140 --> 17:24.520
Actually,
there won't be.

17:24.520 --> 17:26.110
I'm dying, Mom.

17:30.110 --> 17:32.660
Not with your,
uh, treatments...

17:32.660 --> 17:35.620
The doctors don't have a cure
for what I have.

17:37.910 --> 17:39.080
Oh, God.

17:41.120 --> 17:42.750
No, this can't be true.

17:42.750 --> 17:44.710
There -- There must be
something that you can do.

17:44.710 --> 17:46.710
It was hard for me
to process at first, too,

17:46.710 --> 17:48.340
but I've come
to accept it.

17:48.340 --> 17:49.840
I mean, it --

17:49.840 --> 17:51.880
This last year's
been a blessing.

17:51.880 --> 17:54.640
I-I got to make
peace with my past,

17:54.640 --> 17:57.720
make amends
with you and dad,

17:57.720 --> 17:59.970
found Michaela.

17:59.970 --> 18:03.440
I've never had one day
in my adult life

18:03.440 --> 18:06.110
where I've just
celebrated the moment.

18:06.110 --> 18:08.780
To go out knowing I married
the great love of my life

18:08.780 --> 18:12.110
and to have you there
supporting me...

18:12.110 --> 18:14.820
I couldn't ask
for anything more.

18:33.220 --> 18:36.390
Remember, if things go south
and you ever need to contact me,

18:36.390 --> 18:37.970
you just call
the travel agency --

18:37.970 --> 18:40.180
I know the drill.

18:45.980 --> 18:47.810
Automated voice: Please leave
a message at the tone.

18:47.810 --> 18:50.150
I'm sorry to call
on such short notice,

18:50.150 --> 18:52.940
but I-I need a-a non-stop ticket
to Havana.

18:52.940 --> 18:55.780
It is an emergency.
It's life or death.

18:55.780 --> 18:58.580
And you're my only hope.

19:03.290 --> 19:04.580
I need your help.

19:04.580 --> 19:05.830
Yeah, of course.

19:05.830 --> 19:07.330
Uh, just let me find
something first.

19:07.330 --> 19:09.290
I'm helping another passenger
with a Calling.

19:09.290 --> 19:11.760
Today?
What's the Calling?

19:11.760 --> 19:13.380
The plane exploding.

19:13.380 --> 19:15.010
Wow.

19:15.010 --> 19:17.050
Yeah, I can't make heads
or tails of these reports,

19:17.050 --> 19:18.180
but maybe Ward can.

19:18.180 --> 19:19.600
How's your research?

19:19.600 --> 19:20.930
Anything to help Zeke?

19:20.930 --> 19:23.180
Uh, not since I got fired.
What?!

19:23.180 --> 19:24.430
Yeah,
I got kicked out of my lab,

19:24.430 --> 19:26.060
had my medical license
suspended.

19:26.060 --> 19:28.150
My boss tells me
the government's involved.

19:28.150 --> 19:29.520
The Major?

19:29.520 --> 19:31.780
Yeah. Who else?

19:31.780 --> 19:35.070
I don't know what to do.
I'm desperate.

19:35.070 --> 19:37.030
I can't get to my research,
and without my license,

19:37.030 --> 19:39.280
I can't get my hands
on any medication

19:39.280 --> 19:41.330
that can help
Zeke's hypothermia.

19:41.330 --> 19:43.160
I need to figure out
why the Major's back.

19:43.160 --> 19:44.700
It's why I need
to talk to Vance.

19:44.700 --> 19:46.370
Did you try
the travel agency?

19:46.370 --> 19:48.500
It's empty.
Called in a "Havana 9-1-1."

19:48.500 --> 19:50.840
Nothing.
He just vanished.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.420
You know how to reach him.
Saanvi, he made me promise --

19:55.420 --> 19:58.550
Ben, you are following
the Callings to help Zeke!

19:58.550 --> 20:00.430
This is my way
of helping him.

20:00.430 --> 20:02.510
Even if there is a slim chance
that I figure this out in time,

20:02.510 --> 20:04.430
don't you think
that he deserves it?

20:06.310 --> 20:08.810
Help me!

20:08.810 --> 20:10.360
His wife.

20:10.360 --> 20:12.190
You think she knows
that he's alive?

20:12.190 --> 20:13.270
100%.

20:13.270 --> 20:15.030
He told me as much.

20:15.030 --> 20:16.820
She's a principal downtown.

20:16.820 --> 20:18.780
Now, Vance may not
return your call,

20:18.780 --> 20:21.200
but he'll never
ignore hers.

20:21.200 --> 20:22.660
Okay.
Thank you.

20:43.260 --> 20:44.680
There's nothing.

20:45.930 --> 20:48.600
My pre-flight
inspection checklist

20:48.600 --> 20:53.440
compared with post-flight
government inspection report.

20:53.440 --> 20:56.360
There is nothing
different.

20:58.360 --> 21:00.610
I didn't do anything wrong.

21:00.610 --> 21:02.200
This is proof.

21:02.200 --> 21:03.660
The plane landed
in New York

21:03.660 --> 21:05.580
in the exact same condition
it left Jamaica.

21:05.580 --> 21:08.870
Yeah, but what about
the lost time, the explosion?

21:08.870 --> 21:12.000
No one knows how this happened,
not even the government.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.210
But it's not
your fault, Ward.

21:14.210 --> 21:16.550
You don't have to
feel guilty anymore.

21:20.470 --> 21:22.340
I still don't get why,
uh...

21:22.340 --> 21:24.720
you got the same vision
of the plane exploding.

21:24.720 --> 21:26.890
I'm not sure.

21:26.890 --> 21:30.140
I guess I was hoping
for a miracle.

21:30.140 --> 21:31.390
Maybe it was
never about me.

21:31.390 --> 21:33.150
Maybe we were
brought together

21:33.150 --> 21:34.610
so I could...

21:34.610 --> 21:36.860
help you.

21:36.860 --> 21:40.110
You did.

21:40.110 --> 21:41.610
Thank you.

22:19.070 --> 22:20.860
Hey!

22:20.860 --> 22:22.450
Something's wrong!

22:22.450 --> 22:24.320
Damn it, sit up!

22:24.320 --> 22:28.410
He's having a seizure
or something!

22:28.410 --> 22:29.830
Hey, we got a problem over here.
Pull over.

22:29.830 --> 22:31.330
Hurry!

22:38.960 --> 22:40.210
Hurry!
Hey, hey, hey.

22:40.210 --> 22:42.420
Come on, man.
Come on. Yeah, okay.

22:42.420 --> 22:43.470
Jesus.

22:43.470 --> 22:44.720
Hey, get off him!

22:44.720 --> 22:47.390
Hands up!
Get 'em up!

22:47.390 --> 22:49.510
Don't you move,
you scumbag.

23:00.190 --> 23:01.400
Everyone okay?

23:01.400 --> 23:02.860
Get the keys.

23:14.750 --> 23:16.620
Use your cuffs
on the driver.

23:16.620 --> 23:19.290
Hook 'em up to the seat.
Make sure it's tight.

23:28.300 --> 23:29.760
What are you doing?!

23:29.760 --> 23:32.140
You wanna be
a cop killer, too?

23:32.140 --> 23:35.270
If it's the right cop.

23:35.270 --> 23:37.480
Let's go find her.

23:37.480 --> 23:38.940
Get back what's ours.

23:48.700 --> 23:49.950
Saanvi: Estelle, please.

23:49.950 --> 23:51.490
My husband
is dead.

23:51.490 --> 23:53.370
When all seemed lost,
there was one person

23:53.370 --> 23:55.710
who stepped in and helped me,
and that was your husband.

23:55.710 --> 23:59.000
Okay, lives are at stake,
and we are running out of time.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.420
So, please,

24:00.420 --> 24:02.050
could you just tell me
where I can find him?

24:02.050 --> 24:04.340
I need his help.
This is my last resort.

24:04.340 --> 24:06.260
Someone is about to die.

24:06.260 --> 24:08.840
You want to know
where you can find my husband?

24:08.840 --> 24:10.220
At the cemetery.

24:10.220 --> 24:11.800
Please,
just call him.

24:11.800 --> 24:15.480
Get off this property
before I call the police.

24:26.150 --> 24:28.650
Oh!
Pretty dress.

24:28.650 --> 24:30.530
Yeah.
It reminded me of mom's.

24:30.530 --> 24:32.620
I got it
at a thrift shop.

24:32.620 --> 24:34.290
No! No!
Ohh, hey.

24:34.290 --> 24:36.000
It's -- It's -- It's okay.
No, dad! It's not!

24:36.000 --> 24:37.660
It's not even close
to okay!

24:40.420 --> 24:42.540
I don't think
I can do this.

24:45.550 --> 24:48.800
I know the feeling.

24:48.800 --> 24:52.430
I couldn't breathe
on my wedding day.

24:52.430 --> 24:55.430
My tux felt like
an iron lung.

24:57.770 --> 25:00.020
She loved seeing you
dressed up.

25:00.020 --> 25:02.060
She would have given anything

25:02.060 --> 25:04.070
to see you
walk down that aisle.

25:08.440 --> 25:12.120
If you had met her
and she was already sick,

25:12.120 --> 25:13.620
would you have
married her?

25:13.620 --> 25:15.370
Even if I knew

25:15.370 --> 25:18.700
I'd only be married to her
for five minutes,

25:18.700 --> 25:21.370
I would have
done it all again.

25:21.370 --> 25:22.580
In a heartbeat.

25:22.580 --> 25:24.960
She loved you
so much.

25:24.960 --> 25:28.300
And I loved her.

25:28.300 --> 25:31.430
But love doesn't
mean a thing

25:31.430 --> 25:33.800
without a little faith.

25:36.100 --> 25:38.390
If she were me,
what would she do?

25:38.390 --> 25:41.600
I wish I knew, but...

25:41.600 --> 25:43.600
I'm here for you,

you decide.

to get started.

26:05.170 --> 26:08.170

26:14.640 --> 26:16.720
Zeke, I'm sorry
I wasn't there for you

26:16.720 --> 26:19.850

26:19.850 --> 26:21.520
Me, too.

Look, when I'm gone,
Mom's gonna need a friend.

26:28.520 --> 26:31.110
I'm gonna need you to step up
and be there for her.

26:31.110 --> 26:33.860
She's not gonna want it,
but she'll need it.

38:27.120 --> 38:28.870
You gave me
the best bachelor party

38:28.870 --> 38:32.000
I've ever been to.

38:33.210 --> 38:35.130
You be good, little man.

38:42.970 --> 38:44.550
Don't go...

38:44.550 --> 38:47.890
please.

38:47.890 --> 38:50.560
I-I need you.

38:50.560 --> 38:54.940
I'll always be here for you,
with you, okay?

38:54.940 --> 38:57.150
Huh?

39:04.530 --> 39:07.320
And I'll always
be with you.

39:38.190 --> 39:40.110
Geez! Vance!

39:40.110 --> 39:41.570
You scared the crap
out of me.

39:41.570 --> 39:43.150
I'm sorry it took so long
for me to reach out.

39:43.150 --> 39:44.950
I had some...

39:44.950 --> 39:48.240
some other business
out of the country to attend to.

39:48.240 --> 39:50.330
I came as soon as my wife
sent me your SOS.

39:50.330 --> 39:52.910
It was bold of you to show up
at her work, in public.

39:52.910 --> 39:55.580
I didn't have a choice.
The Major.

39:55.580 --> 39:58.130
She had me fired,
had my license revoked,

39:58.130 --> 39:59.670
and I need to know why
she's after me now.

39:59.670 --> 40:01.550
She's cutting
loose ends.

40:01.550 --> 40:03.260
A couple days ago,
the switchboard at the DOD

40:03.260 --> 40:04.880
lit up like
a Christmas tree.

40:04.880 --> 40:07.720
The Major found a breakthrough
with your research.

40:07.720 --> 40:09.430
She needs to make sure
what she discovered

40:09.430 --> 40:12.430
stays in her hands
and her hands only.

40:12.430 --> 40:15.430
She must have
cracked it.

40:15.430 --> 40:18.060
Gotten rid of the DNA anomaly
permanently.

40:18.060 --> 40:19.980
I think it's time for me
to make you disappear.

40:19.980 --> 40:21.440
Run away?

40:21.440 --> 40:22.730
It's for
your own safety.

40:22.730 --> 40:25.650
No, I don't think
you understand.

40:25.650 --> 40:27.400
I am not hiding from her.

40:27.400 --> 40:29.160
I am coming after her.

40:33.120 --> 40:34.450
All cleaned up.

40:34.450 --> 40:36.290
Our house is officially
a pumpkin again.

40:36.290 --> 40:38.170
Dishwasher's loaded.

40:38.170 --> 40:40.460
We're off the clock.
You want to watch a movie?

40:40.460 --> 40:41.750
You pick.

40:41.750 --> 40:43.800
I'm gonna go fire
these babies up.

40:49.380 --> 40:50.680
Mm.

41:04.020 --> 41:05.780
The plane again?

41:07.900 --> 41:11.530
I thought
I'd figured it out.

41:11.530 --> 41:13.120
I guess I didn't.

41:50.900 --> 41:53.120
Who's calling us
on our honeymoon?

41:54.570 --> 41:56.620
Hopefully someone
with some good news.

41:56.620 --> 41:58.790
Hello?

41:58.790 --> 42:00.710
Cal: Auntie Mick!
Help! Help!

42:00.710 --> 42:03.330
Shut that kid up!

42:03.330 --> 42:05.460
Listen, you sick --
No, you listen, bitch!

42:05.460 --> 42:08.130
You have two choices --
You get us back or stash

42:08.130 --> 42:09.550
or you bury your nephew!

42:09.550 --> 42:10.670
Don't you dare
touch him!

42:10.670 --> 42:11.760
Jace: Don't tempt me.

42:11.760 --> 42:13.470
I warned you.

42:13.470 --> 42:15.640
Now you're gonna pay.
