WEBVTT

00:04.229 --> 00:05.678
Sure was sweet of
the neighbors to let us

00:05.679 --> 00:07.848
piggyback onto
their garage sale.

00:07.849 --> 00:08.968
They didn't <i>let </i> us.

00:08.969 --> 00:11.388
I just started throwing
crap on their lawn.

00:11.389 --> 00:13.388
They're too polite to say no.

00:13.389 --> 00:17.348
It's the one up-side of having
religious nuts as neighbors.

00:17.349 --> 00:19.678
Mom, just because people
smile and wave at us,

00:19.679 --> 00:22.098
does not make them
religious nuts.

00:22.099 --> 00:25.058
Hmm. Either way, the meek
are about to inherit

00:25.059 --> 00:27.729
a big ball of tangled
Christmas lights.

00:28.729 --> 00:29.928
Well, that's how
we're gonna play it,

00:29.929 --> 00:32.728
let's giveth unto them
Mike's old snow tires.

00:32.729 --> 00:33.728
Gangway!

00:33.729 --> 00:35.678
Starboard!
Starboard!

00:35.679 --> 00:37.348
Starboard!
Starboard!

00:37.349 --> 00:38.768
On my starboard
or your starboard?

00:38.769 --> 00:41.453
Whichever one doesn't crush
my barnacles against the wall!

00:43.269 --> 00:45.639
Guess what I bought
from the religious nuts?

00:47.099 --> 00:48.638
You got to be kidding me, Vin.

00:48.639 --> 00:50.268
I want that eyesore out of here.

00:50.269 --> 00:51.348
Hold on, Joyce.

00:51.349 --> 00:52.768
You got to picture
it all fixed up,

00:52.769 --> 00:56.179
with me on deck in my Speedo,
like Aristotle Onassis.

00:57.389 --> 00:58.848
Couldn't you have stopped him?

00:58.849 --> 01:00.018
You've seen him in that Speedo.

01:00.019 --> 01:01.428
Oh, I tried to
talk him out of it,

01:01.429 --> 01:02.558
but he made
a very good argument.

01:02.559 --> 01:03.558
What?

01:03.559 --> 01:05.639
I get to be first mate.

01:38.732 --> 01:41.101
Yeah, I got to admit,
man, I had my doubts,

01:41.102 --> 01:43.311
but this boat is really
starting to shape up.

01:43.312 --> 01:46.641
Even smells better since you
found whatever died in the hull.

01:46.642 --> 01:48.021
I don't know what
that skeleton was,

01:48.022 --> 01:50.192
but the thing
in it's belly was a turtle.

01:53.732 --> 01:55.021
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:55.022 --> 01:57.271
What... what are you
doing over there?

01:57.272 --> 01:58.931
I'm sanding.

01:58.932 --> 02:00.692
You're treating it like
it's a piece of wood.

02:01.602 --> 02:03.771
It is a piece of wood.

02:03.772 --> 02:05.891
No, no, no, a boat
is like a lady,

02:05.892 --> 02:09.061
so you got to touch it
like a lady: gentle.

02:09.062 --> 02:10.431
Front...

02:10.431 --> 02:11.691
to back.

02:11.692 --> 02:13.561
Front...

02:13.562 --> 02:14.562
to back.

02:15.932 --> 02:17.812
I know how to touch a lady.

02:19.102 --> 02:20.312
All right, show me again.

02:22.522 --> 02:24.431
There, nice and easy.

02:24.432 --> 02:25.431
Go with the grain,

02:25.432 --> 02:27.061
make it come alive.

02:27.062 --> 02:29.431
Half the work, twice the reward.

02:29.432 --> 02:30.431
You had me at "half the work."

02:30.432 --> 02:31.981
When we're done,

02:31.982 --> 02:34.811
the <i>Jolly Joyce </i> will be
the prettiest tug on Lake Michigan.

02:34.812 --> 02:36.391
(chuckles): <i>Jolly Joyce.</i>

02:36.392 --> 02:39.231
Those are two words
I'd never put together.

02:39.232 --> 02:41.271
Although it will make it harder
for her to take an ax

02:41.272 --> 02:42.431
to something that's
named after her.

02:42.432 --> 02:43.431
Exactly.

02:43.432 --> 02:44.431
Why do you think so many boats

02:44.432 --> 02:45.601
are named after women?

02:45.602 --> 02:47.061
(chuckles)

02:47.062 --> 02:48.431
Not bad.

02:48.432 --> 02:50.141
Not bad. With those
big mitts of yours,

02:50.142 --> 02:51.431
we'll be done in no time.

02:51.432 --> 02:52.641
And then we set sail.

02:52.642 --> 02:53.641
You betcha.

02:53.642 --> 02:55.521
We'll find our own
secret fishing spot

02:55.522 --> 02:56.851
and yank in so many trout,

02:56.852 --> 02:59.692
your grandkids won't even
know the species existed.

03:00.812 --> 03:02.771
I always loved fishing as a kid.

03:02.772 --> 03:05.102
Any sport where you
could sit, really.

03:06.432 --> 03:08.141
Oh, your old man take you out?

03:08.142 --> 03:09.141
All the time.

03:09.142 --> 03:10.601
Some of my best
memories with him.

03:10.602 --> 03:12.771
Well, you and I are going to
make some new memories.

03:12.772 --> 03:14.981
Like the time you ran
and got me that beer.

03:14.982 --> 03:16.431
When was that?

03:16.432 --> 03:18.431
Right now.

03:18.432 --> 03:19.731
Permission to go ashore

03:19.732 --> 03:22.351
and procure us a couple of
cold ones, Captain.

03:22.352 --> 03:23.351
Granted.

03:23.352 --> 03:25.101
And procure some Lysol.

03:25.102 --> 03:27.812
The <i>Jolly Joyce </i> still
stinks like dead turtle.

03:33.272 --> 03:34.771
Okay, h-hold still!

03:34.772 --> 03:36.021
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

03:36.022 --> 03:37.641
I'm not even touching you.

03:37.642 --> 03:38.771
Oh.

03:38.772 --> 03:39.771
- (grunts)
- Ow!

03:39.772 --> 03:41.931
Ha-ha-ha! Got it!

03:41.932 --> 03:44.691
Ooh, splinters and blackheads
are my specialty.

03:44.692 --> 03:46.191
Stay away from my nose.

03:46.192 --> 03:48.231
- We'll see about that.
- Hey, hey.

03:48.232 --> 03:50.021
I can't believe I was
out there for six hours.

03:50.022 --> 03:51.931
I sanded off half
my fingerprints.

03:51.932 --> 03:55.021
According to my right hand,
I don't exist.

03:55.022 --> 03:56.601
You know, I've been kicking
around some names for the boat.

03:56.602 --> 03:59.191
Uh, there's the <i>Good
Golly Miss Molly, </i> or,

03:59.192 --> 04:01.641
I like <i>On the Good Ship
Molly-Pop.</i>

04:01.642 --> 04:02.771
(laughs)

04:02.772 --> 04:04.311
Yeah, Vince is calling her
the <i>Jolly Joyce.</i>

04:04.312 --> 04:06.351
Well, that's a stupid name.

04:06.352 --> 04:08.561
(chuckles)

04:08.562 --> 04:10.061
No, it's-it's not
ready yet anyway.

04:10.062 --> 04:12.561
We still got to patch
the hull, grease the motor,

04:12.562 --> 04:15.731
Flemish the lines,
and unplug the scuppers.

04:15.732 --> 04:18.060
Ooh, hello, sailor.

04:18.062 --> 04:19.141
Vince is teaching
me all the terms.

04:19.142 --> 04:21.101
I think he likes
passing down the knowledge.

04:21.101 --> 04:23.141
Oh, you're like
the baby boy he never had.

04:23.142 --> 04:24.271
Yeah.

04:24.272 --> 04:25.601
(both chuckle)

04:25.602 --> 04:28.431
Uh, oh, and he also taught me
that a boat is like a lady.

04:28.432 --> 04:31.432
Remind me to show you
my new sanding technique.

04:32.602 --> 04:34.271
Don't know what that is,

04:34.272 --> 04:35.931
but I think you're gonna
want to rename it.

04:35.932 --> 04:36.931
(laughs)

04:36.932 --> 04:39.231
Boy, we had a blast
out there today.

04:39.232 --> 04:42.021
Hey, did you know that Vince
was in the Merchant Marines?

04:42.022 --> 04:44.601
He lied about his age
so he could join when he was 17.

04:44.602 --> 04:47.601
You know, he's actually
a fascinating man.

04:47.602 --> 04:50.141
How much varnish
did you inhale today?

04:50.142 --> 04:51.392
So much.

04:52.852 --> 04:53.852
(groans)

05:01.272 --> 05:03.981
There's something sexy
about men in boats.

05:03.982 --> 05:07.981
Well, not those men
and not that boat, but...

05:07.982 --> 05:09.102
you know what I'm saying.

05:11.352 --> 05:13.771
(quietly): Hey! Is Mike still
out in the garage?

05:13.772 --> 05:15.141
Uh, yeah. He and Vince are
having so much fun,

05:15.142 --> 05:18.232
they're peeing in jugs
so they don't have to come inside.

05:19.562 --> 05:21.931
What's in the bags?

05:21.932 --> 05:23.561
Well, you know how Mike's
birthday's coming up,

05:23.562 --> 05:25.431
so I got him
boat slippers, a boat tie,

05:25.432 --> 05:27.852
and a gravy boat
in the shape of a boat.

05:28.852 --> 05:30.601
You have no idea how hard it is

05:30.602 --> 05:33.101
to get presents for somebody
who has no interests.

05:33.102 --> 05:35.102
From now on,
it's all boats, all the time.

05:36.272 --> 05:38.431
I hope he doesn't
get seasick of it.

05:38.432 --> 05:39.431
Get it?

05:39.432 --> 05:40.561
MOLLY: I do get it,

05:40.562 --> 05:43.061
and so do you.

05:43.062 --> 05:44.691
Happy belated.

05:44.692 --> 05:46.021
Oh, you shouldn't have.

05:46.022 --> 05:47.311
No, it's...

05:47.312 --> 05:48.391
it's a bong.

05:48.392 --> 05:49.522
But I'm glad you did.

05:53.142 --> 05:54.851
I think it's sweet,
the two of them

05:54.852 --> 05:57.101
doing this
little project together.

05:57.102 --> 05:59.271
I thought you hated that boat.

05:59.272 --> 06:01.391
You told Vince
that ship's the last thing

06:01.392 --> 06:03.102
he'll be going down on.

06:04.522 --> 06:06.232
Now it goes back.

06:07.772 --> 06:10.101
Let me tell you
a secret about marriage:

06:10.102 --> 06:11.851
when your husband
wants something,

06:11.852 --> 06:14.021
always say no first.

06:14.022 --> 06:15.811
It's all about give and take.

06:15.812 --> 06:18.271
If they think you're
giving them something,

06:18.272 --> 06:19.732
you can take whatever you want.

06:21.272 --> 06:25.271
It works great for cults
and pyramid schemes too.

06:25.272 --> 06:27.351
Say what you will,

06:27.352 --> 06:29.521
but know what I saw when
they dragged that piece of junk

06:29.522 --> 06:30.931
up the driveway?

06:30.932 --> 06:32.891
Two tickets to Tom Jones.

06:32.892 --> 06:35.272
I've already picked out
the thong I'm gonna throw.

06:37.232 --> 06:39.232
Since when do you
wear underwear?

06:42.982 --> 06:45.062
Funerals, Tom Jones.

06:55.932 --> 06:57.601
Look, I want to go on your boat,

06:57.602 --> 06:59.691
but this thing makes me
look like an idiot.

06:59.692 --> 07:01.731
Can't I just wear
my little arm floaties?

07:01.732 --> 07:03.311
Sorry, man, ship's rules.

07:03.312 --> 07:05.771
Every passenger has
to have their own life vest.

07:05.772 --> 07:07.521
- What about you?
- I'm crew.

07:07.522 --> 07:09.311
I'm not wearing
that ridiculous thing.

07:09.312 --> 07:11.351
Wait till you see
this boat, Carl.

07:11.352 --> 07:12.521
She's a thing of beauty.

07:12.522 --> 07:14.601
I'm telling you,
Vince really knows his stuff.

07:14.602 --> 07:15.931
Yeah, you two have been
getting pretty close

07:15.932 --> 07:17.481
during this little Sea-do re-do.

07:17.482 --> 07:18.601
You know, we have.

07:18.602 --> 07:20.271
And that's the magic
of this boat.

07:20.272 --> 07:22.641
She showed me Vince
in a completely different light,

07:22.642 --> 07:24.731
and I'm proud
to call him my captain.

07:24.732 --> 07:26.101
I'm happy for you.

07:26.102 --> 07:27.351
And for me.

07:27.352 --> 07:28.891
'Bout time you found
somebody else to look up to.

07:28.892 --> 07:31.061
What are you talking about?

07:31.062 --> 07:32.601
Well, in my quiet way,

07:32.602 --> 07:33.731
I've given you
guidance all these years.

07:33.732 --> 07:36.021
Okay, one:
you've never been quiet,

07:36.022 --> 07:37.641
and two: the only thing
you've given me

07:37.642 --> 07:38.891
is a bad case of hemorrhoids.

07:38.892 --> 07:42.141
And I'll always
be there for you, Mike.

07:42.142 --> 07:44.061
Just like your hemorrhoids.

07:44.062 --> 07:46.061
Look, what Vince and I have
is different, you know?

07:46.062 --> 07:48.351
I actually think he kind
of sees me like a son.

07:48.352 --> 07:49.431
Yeah?
That's sweet.

07:49.432 --> 07:51.351
Yeah, if I can make his life
a little happier

07:51.352 --> 07:53.271
by playing along, so be it.

07:53.272 --> 07:54.271
You're a good man, Mike Biggs.

07:54.272 --> 07:55.601
Thank you.

07:55.602 --> 07:57.231
- I taught you well.
- Wear your floaties and your vest,

07:57.232 --> 07:58.562
you're going overboard.

08:04.102 --> 08:05.891
Okay, now bear in mind, it still
needs a little more work.

08:05.892 --> 08:06.891
Got it.

08:06.892 --> 08:08.141
Okay, and I might
have talked it up

08:08.142 --> 08:09.601
a little more than I should've.

08:09.602 --> 08:12.561
- It doesn't look exactly like the boat from <i>Jaws.</i>
- Oh.

08:12.562 --> 08:14.641
You're still gonna buy
a harpoon gun though, aren't you?

08:14.642 --> 08:16.061
Oh, yeah. I don't care
if we never use it,

08:16.062 --> 08:17.771
- it's just gonna look cool.
- Yeah.

08:17.772 --> 08:19.771
Okay.

08:19.772 --> 08:21.102
Here she is.

08:22.812 --> 08:24.602
♪ Ta-da! ♪

08:27.482 --> 08:29.432
That's a great trick,
now make it reappear.

08:30.852 --> 08:31.931
What's going on?
Where is it?

08:31.932 --> 08:33.561
Hey, fellas.

08:33.562 --> 08:34.561
Vince, what the hell happened?

08:34.562 --> 08:35.561
Where's the boat?

08:35.562 --> 08:36.601
Oh, you'll never believe it.

08:36.602 --> 08:38.640
Somebody actually bought
that hunk of junk.

08:38.642 --> 08:40.311
What?

08:40.312 --> 08:41.931
It was the craziest thing.

08:41.932 --> 08:44.101
The mailman's at the box,
he sees the boat.

08:44.102 --> 08:45.771
I give him this whole BS spiel

08:45.772 --> 08:48.641
about taking her out
fishing on Lake Michigan.

08:48.642 --> 08:51.431
Like the one you gave me?

08:51.432 --> 08:52.931
Exactly!

08:52.932 --> 08:54.731
That sucker swallowed it
hook, line, and sinker.

08:54.732 --> 08:56.931
Offered me three times
what I paid for it.

08:56.932 --> 08:58.771
Next thing I know,

08:58.772 --> 09:00.811
the mailman's towing behind
his tiny Jeep.

09:00.812 --> 09:02.061
(chuckles)

09:02.062 --> 09:03.141
It-it looked like a little ant

09:03.142 --> 09:06.851
pulling a French fry.

09:06.852 --> 09:08.561
Why didn't you call me?

09:08.562 --> 09:10.891
Well, why would I call you
about me selling my boat?

09:10.892 --> 09:12.811
Because we worked
on it together.

09:12.812 --> 09:15.271
Believe me,
that did not go unnoticed.

09:15.272 --> 09:16.561
You worked hard,

09:16.562 --> 09:18.981
you deserve a tickle.

09:18.982 --> 09:21.021
It's not about the money,

09:21.022 --> 09:23.931
you jackass!

09:23.932 --> 09:25.521
Well, it was just a bunch
of boards and a motor.

09:25.522 --> 09:27.271
What are you getting
so cheesed off about?

09:27.272 --> 09:29.352
Because I'm a bigger sucker
than the mailman.

09:31.852 --> 09:34.352
(Vince stammers)

09:38.732 --> 09:42.285
This is for the bright-orange,
non-refundable life vest.

09:51.457 --> 09:53.263
(doorbell rings)

09:56.067 --> 09:57.316
Okay.

09:57.317 --> 09:58.406
Where's Mike?

09:58.407 --> 09:59.986
Why would you think he was here?

09:59.987 --> 10:02.816
Well, his car's in the driveway,
his shoes are by the door,

10:02.817 --> 10:05.236
and you're holding
a big corner piece of lasagna.

10:05.237 --> 10:07.986
That's pretty much
the smoking gun right there.

10:07.987 --> 10:09.906
Look, I don't know what you
two were fighting about,

10:09.907 --> 10:12.566
but he's right
and you owe him an apology.

10:12.567 --> 10:14.696
We are not fighting.

10:14.697 --> 10:15.906
Well, he's upset
about something.

10:15.907 --> 10:17.776
He marched right upstairs
to his old bedroom

10:17.777 --> 10:20.856
and has been playing records
on his hi-fi ever since.

10:20.857 --> 10:22.276
He's playing records
on his hi-fi?

10:22.277 --> 10:24.946
Is he gonna go
to the sock-hop after that?

10:24.947 --> 10:28.356
He was never invited
to the sock-hop.

10:28.357 --> 10:29.406
It's a damn shame.

10:29.407 --> 10:30.856
He was the best dancer
in that school.

10:30.857 --> 10:33.420
He used to throw me
around like a rag doll.

10:34.407 --> 10:36.986
Please don't give me
those visuals.

10:36.987 --> 10:39.106
Well, if you didn't drive
him back into mama's arms,

10:39.107 --> 10:40.107
what did?

10:41.237 --> 10:42.816
Vince sold his boat.

10:42.817 --> 10:44.356
Mike had a boat?

10:44.357 --> 10:45.856
No, Vi...

10:45.857 --> 10:47.776
No, Vince sold his own boat.

10:47.777 --> 10:50.566
Why would Mikey care
what that salami in a sweat suit

10:50.567 --> 10:52.567
does with his boat?

10:53.777 --> 10:55.356
I think he was looking forward

10:55.357 --> 10:57.526
to going fishing with Vince,
like he used to with his dad.

10:57.527 --> 10:59.196
What the hell are
you talking about?

10:59.197 --> 11:02.486
That rat bastard
never took my boy fishing.

11:02.487 --> 11:04.986
He always promised to,
but the closest he ever came

11:04.987 --> 11:07.406
was dropping Mikey off at
Long John Silver's,

11:07.407 --> 11:10.107
while he went to the booby bar.

11:11.817 --> 11:12.906
Oh, boy, okay.

11:12.907 --> 11:16.196
Mike's gonna really need
this lasagna.

11:16.197 --> 11:18.946
I never liked
that Moranto clown.

11:18.947 --> 11:20.816
Tell Mikey I'll be back.

11:20.817 --> 11:22.066
Where are you going?

11:22.067 --> 11:26.406
To see a man about a boat.

11:26.407 --> 11:29.407
( <i>Tom Sawyer </i> by Rush plays
over the hi-fi)

11:43.750 --> 11:45.406
(knocking on door)

11:45.407 --> 11:48.066
All right, just leave
the lasagna at the door, Ma.

11:48.067 --> 11:49.486
Oh.

11:49.487 --> 11:50.566
- It's me.
- Hey.

11:50.567 --> 11:51.566
(button clicks, music stops)

11:51.567 --> 11:53.067
How much of that did you see?

11:55.027 --> 11:56.986
Uh...

11:56.987 --> 11:59.277
enough to know I want
to date the drummer.

12:00.357 --> 12:01.566
Very funny.

12:01.567 --> 12:02.986
You okay?

12:02.987 --> 12:04.146
Oh, I'm perfect.

12:04.147 --> 12:06.356
I'm a grown man,
laying in his childhood bed

12:06.357 --> 12:08.236
doing an air drum solo.

12:08.237 --> 12:09.697
No red flags here.

12:11.067 --> 12:13.106
When I'd have a really rough
day in high school,

12:13.107 --> 12:15.486
I'd come up to my room,
I'd slam the door,

12:15.487 --> 12:17.406
and I'd do a really
angry river dance.

12:17.407 --> 12:18.567
(chuckles)

12:19.697 --> 12:21.066
I can't believe Vince.

12:21.067 --> 12:23.566
What kind of person
leads someone on like that,

12:23.567 --> 12:27.066
making all sorts of promises
he never planned on keeping?

12:27.067 --> 12:28.566
Yeah.

12:28.567 --> 12:29.946
Kind of sounds like
someone else you know.

12:29.947 --> 12:31.906
Who?

12:31.907 --> 12:33.276
Your father.

12:33.277 --> 12:35.236
Oh, you are way off
on this, okay?

12:35.237 --> 12:37.566
Everything isn't daddy issues.

12:37.567 --> 12:39.356
No, with you it's
mostly mommy issues.

12:39.357 --> 12:40.906
This is kind of
a nice change of pace.

12:40.907 --> 12:43.146
(both chuckle)

12:43.147 --> 12:44.526
(sighs)
Look, Mol, I promise you,

12:44.527 --> 12:46.236
this-this deal between
me and Vince

12:46.237 --> 12:48.606
has nothing to do
with me and my dad.

12:48.607 --> 12:50.816
Although, they are both liars,

12:50.817 --> 12:53.066
and they both reek
of Aqua Velva.

12:53.067 --> 12:56.236
And they both promised
to take you fishing.

12:56.237 --> 12:58.066
And never did.

12:58.067 --> 13:00.527
Is that why you made up
the stories about your dad?

13:03.407 --> 13:05.987
I guess I just
wanted those to be true.

13:07.407 --> 13:09.697
Sure as hell beats the real one.

13:11.487 --> 13:13.567
Well, I want to hear
the real ones.

13:15.567 --> 13:17.316
What's to say?

13:17.317 --> 13:21.066
I walked in on him one day
and he was packing his suitcase.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.406
I said, "Where you going?"

13:22.407 --> 13:25.736
He said, "I'll be back
tomorrow to take you fishing."

13:25.737 --> 13:28.776
So I woke up early,
and I got my pole,

13:28.777 --> 13:32.906
and I waited for him
on the porch.

13:32.907 --> 13:34.107
But he never came.

13:35.567 --> 13:39.446
Turns out that was the day
that he skipped out on us.

13:39.447 --> 13:41.486
I just sat there
waiting to go fishing,

13:41.487 --> 13:43.027
like a chump.

13:45.067 --> 13:46.817
I guess I'm still waiting.

13:49.197 --> 13:51.646
(sighs) You know what?

13:51.647 --> 13:54.406
Just saying
that and getting it out...

13:54.407 --> 13:55.816
I feel better.

13:55.817 --> 13:56.816
I don't.

13:56.817 --> 13:57.816
Oh, Molly.

13:57.817 --> 13:59.106
Oh, no, no.

13:59.107 --> 14:00.906
(chuckling): No.

14:00.907 --> 14:01.906
Are you okay?

14:01.907 --> 14:03.146
Well, I mean,

14:03.147 --> 14:04.146
you're just a little boy,
and you're sitting there

14:04.147 --> 14:06.527
with your little
sad fishing pole.

14:08.407 --> 14:09.737
You need a hug?

14:11.947 --> 14:13.906
(sighs, sniffles)

14:13.907 --> 14:15.566
Does someone need
to river dance?

14:15.567 --> 14:18.066
(laughs)

14:18.067 --> 14:19.146
Maybe later.

14:19.147 --> 14:20.147
- Okay.
- Yeah.

14:26.907 --> 14:29.316
Why the hell's
my mom's car on the lawn?

14:29.317 --> 14:31.026
Did you say something to her?

14:31.027 --> 14:32.236
Uh, you know,

14:32.237 --> 14:33.986
we exchanged our usual
pleasantries.

14:33.987 --> 14:35.946
I might've mentioned Vince

14:35.947 --> 14:38.566
and, you know, maybe the boat,

14:38.567 --> 14:40.696
and Vince might've broken
your heart with the boat.

14:40.697 --> 14:42.906
- Oh, God!
- I didn't know!

14:42.907 --> 14:45.776
PEGGY: All the boy wanted to do
was go fishing.

14:45.777 --> 14:47.236
It may not
seem important to you,

14:47.237 --> 14:48.776
but it was important to him.

14:48.777 --> 14:50.446
VINCE: I know that now.
You made that very clear.

14:50.447 --> 14:52.906
PEGGY: Do you have any idea
how hard it is

14:52.907 --> 14:54.566
to be both mother
and father to him.

14:54.567 --> 14:57.446
I had to teach him how to shave,
and slow dance.

14:57.447 --> 14:58.646
(Vince groans)

14:58.647 --> 15:00.946
You did a remarkable job
with both those things.

15:00.947 --> 15:02.906
Mike, do you think
you should jump in there?

15:02.907 --> 15:06.026
Eh, she drove
all the way over here.

15:06.027 --> 15:08.026
VINCE: I don't know.
I've never had kids.

15:08.027 --> 15:09.276
PEGGY: That you know of!

15:09.277 --> 15:11.146
And if you did,
they'd be swimming around

15:11.147 --> 15:14.406
in the shallow end
of the gene pool!

15:14.407 --> 15:16.406
You know what? It's actually
pretty entertaining

15:16.407 --> 15:19.196
when she's not yelling at me.

15:19.197 --> 15:21.526
Mother Biggs, all I did
was sell a boat.

15:21.527 --> 15:23.856
This has nothing
to do with the boat.

15:23.857 --> 15:26.356
This is between you and me.

15:26.357 --> 15:27.946
I-I think you
might be projecting now.

15:27.947 --> 15:28.946
Oh, I'm gonna project you

15:28.947 --> 15:30.316
through that glass cabinet!

15:30.317 --> 15:31.316
(Vince groans)

15:31.317 --> 15:32.316
- Okay, it's getting violent.
- Oh!

15:32.317 --> 15:33.486
We should get in there.

15:33.487 --> 15:35.107
No, no, no, Mike,
it's just getting good!

15:36.407 --> 15:39.236
I'm gonna rip the last
five hairs out of your head!

15:39.237 --> 15:41.406
(groans)

15:41.407 --> 15:43.606
Oh, get him!

15:43.607 --> 15:46.067
(laughs)

15:49.777 --> 15:50.776
Hey.

15:50.777 --> 15:51.776
Hey.

15:51.777 --> 15:53.106
Listen, big guy,

15:53.107 --> 15:54.986
I-I've been feeling bad
about the whole boat thing.

15:54.987 --> 15:56.736
Oh, hey, look,
don't worry about it, okay?

15:56.737 --> 15:58.066
I got carried away.

15:58.067 --> 15:59.406
It's over.

15:59.407 --> 16:02.316
I know, but I like the time
we spent together on it.

16:02.317 --> 16:04.316
Hey, I was thinking maybe you
and I could go in the backyard

16:04.317 --> 16:06.356
and toss the ol' pigskin around.

16:06.357 --> 16:07.736
I'm good.

16:07.737 --> 16:09.816
You sure?
'Cause we could do something else.

16:09.817 --> 16:12.356
Mini-golf, a batting cage.

16:12.357 --> 16:13.566
Oh, I saw in the paper

16:13.567 --> 16:15.356
that the Harlem Globetrotters
are in town.

16:15.357 --> 16:17.737
I hear the new Curly's a broad.

16:18.817 --> 16:21.356
Bald head and everything.

16:21.357 --> 16:22.406
Look, Vince, seriously,

16:22.407 --> 16:23.986
you don't have to do all
this, okay?

16:23.987 --> 16:26.486
I'm-I'm fine.
Just let it go.

16:26.487 --> 16:27.566
All right.

16:27.567 --> 16:28.906
I won't bother you.

16:28.907 --> 16:30.486
Enjoy your paper.

16:30.487 --> 16:32.316
Uh, um, I'm gonna take off.

16:32.317 --> 16:34.026
Oh, if Joyce asks,

16:34.027 --> 16:37.277
just tell her I went to DQ
to get a dipped cone.

16:46.357 --> 16:49.736
Ho! Do I know my boy?
Come for that.

16:49.737 --> 16:52.196
All right, now this is
about the ice cream,

16:52.197 --> 16:53.356
and nothing else.

16:53.357 --> 16:54.566
You got it, champ.

16:54.567 --> 16:55.906
And if you lied
about that dipped cone,

16:55.907 --> 16:57.527
you're a dead man.

17:08.087 --> 17:09.536
Come on, please?

17:09.537 --> 17:11.705
No!

17:11.707 --> 17:12.705
I can't sleep.

17:12.707 --> 17:13.705
Now that you told me
you could do it,

17:13.707 --> 17:14.826
it's all I can think about.

17:14.827 --> 17:16.957
Well, it's not gonna happen.

17:17.877 --> 17:18.876
That's not fair.

17:18.877 --> 17:20.246
You walked in on me doing it.

17:20.247 --> 17:21.415
Well, who's fault is that?

17:21.416 --> 17:23.247
You should've locked the door.

17:24.127 --> 17:26.826
Please?
Don't make me beg.

17:26.827 --> 17:27.996
(sighs)

17:27.997 --> 17:29.626
Fine.

17:29.627 --> 17:30.626
If you brag to your friends
about it,

17:30.627 --> 17:32.086
I am never doing it again.

17:32.087 --> 17:33.339
I won't say a word.

17:35.917 --> 17:39.036
Oh my God! It's even cuter
than I thought!

17:39.037 --> 17:40.706
It's actually really cathartic.
