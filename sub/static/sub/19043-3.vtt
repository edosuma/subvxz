- Oh, good.

10:59.288 --> 11:00.820
If there's one thing
I've learned over the years

11:00.822 --> 11:02.388
Is that you just
can't give up.

11:02.390 --> 11:03.922
Yeah.

11:03.924 --> 11:06.457
$10,000 bail.

11:06.459 --> 11:09.460
We could just
go to hawaii.

11:09.462 --> 11:10.761
I'm just kidding.

11:10.763 --> 11:12.662
I get anxious during
these type of things.

11:12.664 --> 11:14.897
Yeah, I understand.
It can get confusing.

11:14.899 --> 11:15.931
Yeah.

11:15.933 --> 11:17.499
Again, good luck.

11:17.501 --> 11:19.234
Oh, thank you very much.
I appreciate it.

11:19.236 --> 11:20.834
- All right.
- Thank you.

11:22.736 --> 11:23.836
Bail?

11:25.271 --> 11:28.172
Well, I would consider that
a successful first date,

11:28.174 --> 11:30.741
- Wouldn't you?
- Yeah, I guess.

11:30.743 --> 11:33.243
You really talk a lot
during movies, dale.

11:33.245 --> 11:35.078
Oh, yes,
I certainly do.

11:35.080 --> 11:36.479
I certainly do.

11:36.481 --> 11:38.414
So, listen, I was thinkin'
maybe we could get

11:38.416 --> 11:41.583
Another date on the books.
Next Tuesday I have
a pta meeting, which--

11:41.585 --> 11:43.284
<i>Hey, martha, it's chip.</i>
<i>Did you tell dale,</i>

11:43.286 --> 11:45.352
<i>'cause mom's really</i>
<i>upset right now.</i>

11:45.354 --> 11:47.287
<i>She might fall into</i>
<i>another coma because of you.</i>

11:47.289 --> 11:50.423
...Tossed salad
entrapped in jell-o,
which I love.

11:50.425 --> 11:51.791
What are you doing?

11:51.793 --> 11:54.093
Um, dale, I'm sorry,

11:54.095 --> 11:56.595
But I don't think I can
go out with you again.

11:56.597 --> 11:58.463
Well, why not?
This was a very successful
first date.

11:58.465 --> 12:00.097
I just said that.

12:00.099 --> 12:03.133
I know, but I'm just
really worried about chip.

12:03.135 --> 12:05.935
Worried about chip?
He is--

12:05.937 --> 12:08.037
He's a felon.

12:08.039 --> 12:11.106
Look, you know how
in the pixar movie

12:11.108 --> 12:13.475
There's a coffee cup
and a coffee can?

12:13.477 --> 12:14.843
Yes,
and a talking pencil.

12:14.845 --> 12:18.346
Right, so for me,
chip is like the coffee cup,

12:18.348 --> 12:21.182
And you're like
the coffee can

12:21.184 --> 12:24.818
Who the pencil doesn't
really want to, um,

12:24.820 --> 12:26.719
Be more than
friends with.

12:26.721 --> 12:28.187
Well, you're like
the talking pencil to me,

12:28.189 --> 12:29.521
Because you're always
runnin' your mouth.

12:29.523 --> 12:31.289
Do you know how much
this date cost me?

12:31.291 --> 12:34.058
It almost cost me $40,
martha.

12:34.060 --> 12:35.526
And it would have
cost me $40

12:35.528 --> 12:36.960
Had I not borrowed
the $5 from you

12:36.962 --> 12:39.562
To buy that family size
goober box!

12:39.564 --> 12:41.530
You're such a selfish
little prick!

12:41.532 --> 12:44.099
Dale, wait.
You're my ride.

12:48.370 --> 12:50.971
Okay, maybe this is
a good opportunity

12:50.973 --> 12:52.605
To sign up for uber.

13:06.552 --> 13:09.053
Yeah, can I get
another one of those,
please?

13:11.490 --> 13:12.889
Maybe I might
end up doing it.

13:12.891 --> 13:14.156
I-- I might do
some paperwork

13:14.158 --> 13:15.924
Or something like that
for later,

13:15.926 --> 13:17.091
But it's not even--

13:21.695 --> 13:23.762

13:23.764 --> 13:25.897

it looked like something
was wrong with you.

13:30.169 --> 13:31.902

13:32.938 --> 13:34.604

One of your friends.

Either one of 'em,
but it doesn't matter.

13:38.408 --> 13:40.241

making a pass at you?

13:41.744 --> 13:44.511
You know what?
Can I get this to go, please?

13:44.513 --> 13:45.945
