Ambassador Mollari.

00:19.042 --> 00:21.583
We need to talk about
the Euphrates treaty.

00:21.667 --> 00:25.500
My dear Sinclair, this is hardly
the time or the place, huh?

00:25.583 --> 00:28.625
I agree. But you've been
ducking me on this for a week.

00:28.708 --> 00:31.375
Now I expect you in
the Council Chambers

00:31.458 --> 00:32.750
at 10:00 tomorrow morning

00:32.833 --> 00:35.292
to begin formal negotiations
with the Narn.

00:35.375 --> 00:37.750
Unless of course you wish to
pursue the wise course

00:37.833 --> 00:40.417
and cede all claim
to the Euphrates sector.

00:40.500 --> 00:43.250
I would rather kiss
a Jovian tree worm.

00:43.333 --> 00:46.083
You've kissed far worse things
in your times, Mollari.

00:46.167 --> 00:49.292
Yes, and you can kiss
my plump Centauri..

00:49.375 --> 00:52.458
Ah! Gentlemen, this is what
I've been waiting for.

00:52.542 --> 00:54.958
Please, sit down.
Don't miss it.

00:55.042 --> 00:56.292
'Sit!'

00:56.375 --> 00:58.667
[instrumental music]

00:58.750 --> 01:00.125
[laughs]
Yes.

01:08.667 --> 01:10.375
Is she not perfection?

01:16.875 --> 01:20.958
Gentlemen,
of all things in life

01:21.042 --> 01:23.375
are females not the finest?

01:23.458 --> 01:26.667
On that, Mollari,
we can at least agree.

01:29.583 --> 01:31.208
Ambassador G'Kar!

01:33.000 --> 01:34.833
[coughs]

01:34.917 --> 01:39.000
I am Ko D'Ath, the new head
of your diplomatic staff.

01:39.083 --> 01:42.875
[laughs]
Yes, I-I wasn't expecting you
for several year, days.

01:42.958 --> 01:47.917
I was eager to begin my duties,
so I booked early transport.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.667
'Mr. Garibaldi said that'

01:49.750 --> 01:53.667
I would find you
in this...establishment.

01:53.750 --> 01:56.958
Ah, yes, Mr. Garibaldi
is most helpful.

01:57.042 --> 01:59.667
Hey, hotspot, how about
you and me blow this joint

01:59.750 --> 02:01.875
and go play Scan the Sector?

02:01.958 --> 02:03.208
[screeches]

02:10.458 --> 02:11.583
Trash.

02:13.083 --> 02:15.917
You must be fatigued
from your long journey.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.667
Allow me to show you
to your quarters.

02:24.333 --> 02:27.958
You know, sometimes
I almost feel sorry for G'Kar.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.417

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
(male narrator)
It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind

03:12.083 --> 03:15.083
ten years after
the Earth-Minbari War.

03:15.167 --> 03:18.417
The Babylon Project
was a dream given form.

03:18.500 --> 03:21.917
Its goal, to prevent another
war by creating a place

03:22.000 --> 03:23.417
where humans and aliens

03:23.500 --> 03:26.042
could work out
their differences peacefully.

03:26.125 --> 03:28.917
It's a port of call,
home away from home

03:29.042 --> 03:34.000
for diplomats, hustlers,
entrepreneurs and wanderers.

03:34.083 --> 03:38.375
Humans and aliens,
wrapped in 2,500,000 tons

03:38.458 --> 03:42.500
of spinning metal,
all alone in the night.

03:43.917 --> 03:45.958
It can be a dangerous place.

03:46.042 --> 03:49.125
But it's our last,
best hope for peace.

03:49.208 --> 03:53.083
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

03:53.167 --> 03:55.542
The year is 2258.

03:55.625 --> 03:59.333
The name of the place
is Babylon 5.

04:52.083 --> 04:53.417
'Flagging.'

04:53.500 --> 04:54.833
What the hell?

04:57.792 --> 05:01.250
- Garibaldi to Sinclair.
- Sinclair here.

05:01.333 --> 05:03.375
(Garibaldi)
'Commander I turned up an
unauthorized transmission'

05:03.458 --> 05:05.458
to Earth on Gold Channels.

05:05.542 --> 05:08.917
Run it by the EO, I'll check
back with you when I can.

05:12.417 --> 05:15.208
This delay is
quite insufferable, commander!

05:15.292 --> 05:16.750
As ambassador of the Narn regime

05:16.833 --> 05:19.125
I demand ambassador Mollari
be censured

05:19.208 --> 05:21.000
for his flouting of protocol!

05:21.083 --> 05:24.542
I'll be glad to censure him
when he gets here.

05:24.625 --> 05:27.042
- 'Mr. Cotto?'
- Yes?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.875
Please try the ambassador again.

05:30.958 --> 05:32.250
I tried three times

05:32.333 --> 05:34.833
there's still no answer
from his quarters.

05:37.125 --> 05:39.125
Then try him again.

05:45.750 --> 05:48.000
If you'll excuse me
for a moment.

05:57.083 --> 05:58.667
[sighs]

05:58.750 --> 06:00.583
- Talia?
- Yeah.

06:00.667 --> 06:02.375
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:02.458 --> 06:03.917
- Are you alright?
- Yeah.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.417
I just had to get some distance.

06:05.500 --> 06:06.875
Too much strong emotion

06:06.958 --> 06:09.333
in close proximity
is hard to block.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.583
These talks are very important
to you, aren't they?

06:13.667 --> 06:14.917
Earth Central wants
a peaceful settlement.

06:16.083 --> 06:17.417
And so do I.

06:17.500 --> 06:18.667
It'll show them Babylon 5

06:18.750 --> 06:20.458
is doing the job
it was meant to do.

06:20.542 --> 06:23.333
If you can get the Narn
and Centauri to cooperate.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.292
Londo and G'Kar
know a peaceful solution

06:25.375 --> 06:26.958
and the Euphrates sector
would benefit them

06:27.042 --> 06:29.667
more than a conflict.
That's where you come in.

06:29.750 --> 06:32.583
You're my peeler, you're going
to peel away their lies

06:32.667 --> 06:35.458
until they're left
with that inescapable truth.

06:35.542 --> 06:36.958
Sounds like you got a good shot.

06:37.042 --> 06:39.958
I do...if Londo ever shows up.

06:41.042 --> 06:43.500
[humming]

06:50.208 --> 06:51.333
[laughing]

06:51.417 --> 06:53.250
Great maker.

06:53.333 --> 06:56.208
For a moment there
I thought I was dead.

06:56.292 --> 06:59.417
You seemed alive enough
a few minutes ago.

07:03.875 --> 07:07.792
You make me alive,
you fountain of passion.

07:07.875 --> 07:10.958
It's the least I can do
for the republic, ambassador.

07:11.042 --> 07:14.167
Ah, you see, now, I hate it
when you call me that.

07:14.250 --> 07:16.292
I'm Centauri.

07:16.375 --> 07:18.500
Your title pleases me.

07:19.708 --> 07:21.458
Just as it does you.

07:23.542 --> 07:26.333
So it's my title
you wanted all along, huh?

07:26.417 --> 07:29.083
I want no more
than I'm getting.

07:31.500 --> 07:35.167
And what is it
that you're getting, Adira?

07:35.250 --> 07:38.500
A washed-up old republican..

07:38.583 --> 07:40.875
...dreaming of better days?

07:40.958 --> 07:43.750
These are my better days, Londo.

07:45.792 --> 07:48.208
Thanks to you.

07:48.292 --> 07:50.125
[monitor beeping]

07:50.208 --> 07:52.125
[sighs]

07:52.208 --> 07:55.583
You're needed.
And I have to go.

07:59.958 --> 08:02.000
Alright, I'm coming.

08:07.125 --> 08:10.750
What do you want,
you moon-faced assassin of joy?

08:10.833 --> 08:13.667
Ambassador, you were supposed to
begin negotiation

08:13.750 --> 08:15.708
with the Narns over an hour ago.

08:15.792 --> 08:18.458
Commander Sinclair
is quite beside himself.

08:18.542 --> 08:20.542
Well, it does G'Kar
good to wait.

08:20.625 --> 08:23.167
But you can tell Sinclair
I'll be there shortly.

08:23.250 --> 08:25.167
- Yes, sir.
- 'And, Vir.'

08:25.250 --> 08:26.417
Yes, sir?

08:26.500 --> 08:28.917
Have some hot jala
waiting for me.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.417
Yes. Yes, sir.

08:38.333 --> 08:39.625
You're overreacting,
Mr. Garibaldi.

08:39.708 --> 08:40.917
There could be
any number of reasons

08:41.000 --> 08:42.167
for this communications anomaly.

08:42.250 --> 08:43.375
Such as?

08:43.458 --> 08:44.583
Well, computer error,
magnetic pulse.

08:44.667 --> 08:46.083
I checked that.

08:46.167 --> 08:47.417
Well, maybe one of the
ambassadors is tryin' to save

08:47.500 --> 08:49.083
a few credits again,
or perhaps

08:49.167 --> 08:52.458
it's what us Russian pilots
used to call gremlins.

08:52.542 --> 08:53.875
Lieutenant commander,
Gold Channels

08:53.958 --> 08:55.667
are priority access,
useable only by

08:55.750 --> 08:57.625
express permission
of Commander Sinclair.

08:57.708 --> 08:59.083
No one out side
of the ambassadors

08:59.167 --> 09:01.250
and senior officers
even know they exist.

09:01.333 --> 09:02.500
If someone's hacked into them

09:02.583 --> 09:04.333
communication security's
at risk.

09:04.417 --> 09:06.708
The Pireaus' requesting
clearance to depart.

09:06.792 --> 09:08.875
Re-route the Balosian freighter
to dock H

09:08.958 --> 09:11.125
and inform the Pireaus
she may depart at 1200.

09:11.208 --> 09:12.500
Affirmative.

09:12.583 --> 09:14.542
Mr. Garibaldi,
I know it's a problem

09:14.625 --> 09:16.667
but one transmission
is not a conspiracy.

09:16.750 --> 09:18.375
Now, you've informed me
as the commander ordered

09:18.458 --> 09:20.458
and I will attend to it
when my other duties permit.

09:20.542 --> 09:22.750
In the mean time I suggest
you monitor the Gold Channels

09:22.833 --> 09:24.667
more closely in case
there's a second occurrence.

09:24.750 --> 09:26.208
I've already seen to it.

09:26.292 --> 09:28.833
Well, then thankfully there's no
further need for us to chat.

09:28.917 --> 09:31.417
[instrumental music]

09:38.833 --> 09:41.458
[clears throat]
Greetings.

09:41.542 --> 09:43.542
'You have my abject apologies.'

09:43.625 --> 09:47.375
I was delayed on an
important matter of state.

09:47.458 --> 09:48.917
G'Kar.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
Ah, the impressive
Ms. Ko D'Ath.

09:52.083 --> 09:53.708
[growls]

09:53.792 --> 09:55.542
So good to see you again.

09:59.750 --> 10:01.833
You are a treasure, Vir.

10:03.750 --> 10:05.333
Well, shall we begin?

10:07.333 --> 10:09.208
[humming]

10:12.833 --> 10:15.833
- Feeling happy, are we?
- Trakis!

10:17.500 --> 10:20.958
I take it all is going well
with the ambassador?

10:21.042 --> 10:22.542
Yes.

10:25.583 --> 10:29.042
Then why haven't you got
the purple files from him yet?

10:29.125 --> 10:31.708
But it's difficult.

10:31.792 --> 10:33.750
He, he doesn't trust me.
I-I--

10:33.833 --> 10:36.833
You forget your place, Centauri.

10:36.917 --> 10:39.500
A slave must never lie
to her master.

10:42.375 --> 10:45.375
Trakis, please.
Please.

10:50.042 --> 10:51.833
Do you know why a drunken fool

10:51.917 --> 10:55.042
like Mollari
has the power he has?

10:55.125 --> 10:57.583
'Because his family
has been collecting dirt'

10:57.667 --> 10:59.833
on other families for years.

10:59.917 --> 11:03.833
Like all the noble houses
of the great Centauri Republic.

11:05.792 --> 11:08.625
That's how they play the game,
isn't it?

11:08.708 --> 11:12.958
Whispers in the dark.
A knife in the back.

11:13.042 --> 11:16.583
Not all Centauri
play such games.

11:16.667 --> 11:19.167
Yes, and they wind up like you

11:19.250 --> 11:23.167
without family,
prestige or power.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.792
Slaves.

11:27.875 --> 11:32.042
Those files can bring down
any house in the republic.

11:33.292 --> 11:36.792
The Narn will pay well
for that data.

11:36.875 --> 11:39.583
And I want it...tonight.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.792
Use the mind probe.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.750
You know how.

11:58.958 --> 12:01.583
Cheer up.
It's not so bad.

12:01.667 --> 12:03.833
After you're done your job,
you'll have your freedom.

12:03.917 --> 12:07.208
Ambassador Mollari
will have his memories.

12:07.292 --> 12:09.500
And I'll have
the Centauri Empire

12:09.583 --> 12:11.375
by its mighty throat.

12:20.542 --> 12:22.458
[instrumental music]

12:26.458 --> 12:27.917
Open.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.667
Star Laces!

12:32.750 --> 12:35.708
Oh, I haven't seen these
since I left Davo.

12:35.792 --> 12:38.750
- Where did you get them?
- I had them grown for you.

12:39.667 --> 12:41.250
Oh..

13:02.542 --> 13:05.958
- What's this?
- Open it and find out.

13:14.458 --> 13:15.958
It's beautiful.

13:16.042 --> 13:18.667
It's from the earliest days
of the republic.

13:18.750 --> 13:21.917
It originally belonged
to a matriarch of my family.

13:22.000 --> 13:27.542
A woman of wisdom and strength,
grace, and great beauty.

13:27.625 --> 13:29.542
I've had it for many years.

13:32.917 --> 13:34.125
I can't take it.

13:34.208 --> 13:36.542
(Mollari)
'Oh, but you must.'

13:36.625 --> 13:38.083
I insist.

13:39.167 --> 13:42.583
And you know how stubborn I am.
Come on.

13:46.167 --> 13:49.333
[laughs]
'Go ahead.'

13:54.708 --> 13:56.542
Pretty.

13:56.625 --> 14:00.292
Well, should I
order us some supper?

14:00.375 --> 14:03.000
- You must be hungry.
- Famished.

14:03.083 --> 14:05.917
And after spending a day
dealing with Ambassador G'Kar

14:06.000 --> 14:09.125
I long to sink my teeth
into something.

14:09.208 --> 14:12.083
But why don't we go out?

14:14.083 --> 14:16.917
- You're not serious?
- Yes.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.083
I've already made
the reservation at Fresh Air.

14:20.167 --> 14:23.875
That's the finest restaurant
on Babylon 5.

14:23.958 --> 14:27.167
What if we're seen together?
What will people say?

14:27.250 --> 14:29.583
They'll say..

14:29.667 --> 14:34.625
They'll say, "Ambassador Mollari
is a most fortunate man."

14:37.375 --> 14:41.625
We Centauri live our lives
for appearances

14:41.708 --> 14:43.708
positions, status, title.

14:43.792 --> 14:46.750
These are things
by which we define ourselves.

14:46.833 --> 14:51.417
But when I look beneath the mask
I am forced to wear..

14:51.500 --> 14:53.250
...I see only emptiness.

14:54.708 --> 14:57.958
And then I think of you..

14:58.042 --> 15:03.042
...and I say, "To hell
with appearances."

15:03.125 --> 15:05.708

15:14.000 --> 15:15.250

15:42.500 --> 15:45.125

15:45.208 --> 15:47.500
Ah, damn, damn, damn.

15:49.667 --> 15:52.292
Ah, this place is marvelous.

15:53.625 --> 15:55.000
After the effort
you put in today

15:55.083 --> 15:56.500
I felt you deserve it.

15:56.583 --> 15:57.875
Oh, they were quite a mind full.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.333
I haven't sensed so many lies

15:59.417 --> 16:01.917
since I worked for
the Political Bureau.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.542
- And Londo.
- What about him?

16:04.625 --> 16:07.208
Well, his thoughts, they were..

16:07.292 --> 16:09.417
...intensely..

16:09.500 --> 16:11.042
Intensely what?

16:12.125 --> 16:13.750
Erotic.

16:13.833 --> 16:15.792
I'm not surprised.

16:19.750 --> 16:21.625
voila.

16:23.542 --> 16:25.208
[indistinct chatter]

16:29.292 --> 16:32.583
Garibaldi, why are your fingers
on my console?

16:32.667 --> 16:34.917
Our gremlins made another call.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.292
Did you track it?

16:36.375 --> 16:38.208
Got a prefix
on a Russian consortium

16:38.292 --> 16:41.167
then I hit a wall program hard.
Blacked my board.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.667
If he used ICE,
then you've got him.

16:42.750 --> 16:44.917
- It'll show up on a scan.
- I know.

Gold Channel transmissions.

'No unauthorized transmissions
logged.'

17:00.250 --> 17:01.375
What?

17:01.458 --> 17:02.708
Are you sure
this isn't just a figment

17:02.792 --> 17:04.458
of your demented imagination?

17:04.542 --> 17:06.292
A cry for help, perhaps?

17:13.792 --> 17:15.750
Did you enjoy the dinner?

17:15.833 --> 17:18.417
It was wonderful.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.833
Why don't you, uh..

17:20.917 --> 17:22.708
...make yourself more
comfortable

17:22.792 --> 17:25.125
while I finish the drinks?

17:25.208 --> 17:28.208
Yeah.
A capital idea.

[intense music]

18:05.958 --> 18:07.375
[music continues]

18:07.458 --> 18:09.833

18:57.667 --> 19:00.667

19:03.000 --> 19:06.250
Adira, my dove.

19:06.333 --> 19:08.833
[music continues]

19:09.458 --> 19:11.542
Londo..

19:11.625 --> 19:14.750
...tell me the access code
for your purple files.

19:16.667 --> 19:18.292
Tell me now.

19:20.542 --> 19:23.375
Triple cipher.

19:23.458 --> 19:27.208
Wine...women..

19:27.292 --> 19:29.083

21:29.375 --> 21:30.958
[groans]

21:32.375 --> 21:34.292
Assassin, villain!

21:34.375 --> 21:36.583
Stop that infernal bleeping!

21:36.667 --> 21:39.250
Enter! Enter.

21:40.042 --> 21:42.000
Oh, my head.

21:42.083 --> 21:45.875
Ambassador, you ordered me to
rouse you for the negotiations.

21:45.958 --> 21:49.042
Quietly, though, Vir. Quietly.

21:49.125 --> 21:53.250
My brain feels like it's been
sucked out through my ear.

21:53.333 --> 21:56.708
- Get my coat, will you?
- Yes, ambassador!

21:59.667 --> 22:00.917
[sighs]

22:07.667 --> 22:10.208
[intense music]

22:20.500 --> 22:23.083
[monitor beeping]

22:30.542 --> 22:34.125
Where have you been? I've been
trying to reach you all night.

22:34.208 --> 22:37.500
- 'Did you get Mollari's files?'
- Yes.

22:37.583 --> 22:42.375
- Good. I'll be there at once.
- No!

22:42.458 --> 22:46.000
Londo may come
looking for me here.

22:46.083 --> 22:49.750
I'll meet you on the Zocalo,
near the Galactic Boutique.

22:49.833 --> 22:53.333
Ten minutes. Don't be late.

23:06.833 --> 23:08.458
[sighs]

23:22.333 --> 23:27.125
Ambassador, I really think
we need to be going.

23:27.208 --> 23:29.458
Vir, I had a thought.

23:29.542 --> 23:34.792
Why don't you represent
our republic in the talks today?

23:34.875 --> 23:36.458
- Me?
- Yes, why not?

23:36.542 --> 23:38.667
You know the situation
as well as I.

23:38.750 --> 23:42.583
It's the perfect opportunity
to get your feet moist,

23:42.667 --> 23:43.958
as the Earthlings say.

23:44.042 --> 23:46.167
I actually don't think
it's wise idea--

23:46.250 --> 23:48.917
Nonsense! I have
every confidence in you

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000
which is why I am giving you
full ambassadorial authority.

23:54.083 --> 23:55.500
Be proud, my boy.

23:55.583 --> 23:59.500
You are now the voice of
the mighty Centauri Empire!

23:59.583 --> 24:05.500
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
- That's the spirit! Go now!

24:05.583 --> 24:07.750
I'll be along later
to see how you're doing.

24:07.833 --> 24:10.375
- Yes, sir.
- And, Vir.

24:10.458 --> 24:14.125
- Yes, sir?
- Don't give away the homeworld.

24:14.208 --> 24:16.208
No, of course not.

24:16.292 --> 24:19.167
[intense music]

24:19.250 --> 24:21.875
[indistinct chatter]

24:51.958 --> 24:53.792
Adira!

24:57.958 --> 24:59.333
Hey, who you pushing, cork-face?

24:59.417 --> 25:02.083
- Out of my way.
- Ah!

25:02.167 --> 25:03.583
[grunting]

25:03.667 --> 25:06.250
[groaning]

25:07.708 --> 25:10.250
[intense music]

25:18.417 --> 25:19.833
Adira!

25:21.333 --> 25:25.458
- Adira?
- She's not there, ambassador.

25:25.542 --> 25:27.583
My name is Trakis.

25:27.667 --> 25:31.208
We have a great deal in common.
Adira has betrayed us both.

25:31.292 --> 25:33.333
[intense music]

25:38.583 --> 25:41.000
There's a transport
leaving for Davo tomorrow.

25:41.083 --> 25:43.583
If I can get there
Trakis will never find me.

25:43.667 --> 25:46.125
- Can you book passage for me?
- Of course.

25:46.208 --> 25:51.208
And don't worry. You'll be safe
at my place until then.

25:51.292 --> 25:53.875
Adira, a Narn agent?

25:53.958 --> 25:59.750
[laughs]
You must be mad.
She is Centauri.

25:59.833 --> 26:01.583
Don't be a fool, ambassador.

26:01.667 --> 26:04.208
If those files wind up
in the hands of you enemies'

26:04.292 --> 26:08.417
your career and your republic
will be finished.

26:08.500 --> 26:10.792
What's your concern
in all of this?

26:10.875 --> 26:15.208
I'm simply protecting
my interests...and my property.

26:19.750 --> 26:21.250
She's a slave?

26:21.333 --> 26:23.917
Duly contracted by the laws
of your own republic.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.542
And by those same laws,
as her owner

26:26.625 --> 26:31.083
I can be held responsible
for any crime she commits.

26:34.667 --> 26:37.208
[intense music]

26:46.542 --> 26:52.250
She's used you, just as
she's used everyone in her life.

26:52.333 --> 26:53.958
You must find her!

26:54.042 --> 26:57.167
- Get out.
- She lied to you.

26:57.250 --> 27:01.250
- She didn't care for you, she--
- I said, get out!

27:01.333 --> 27:03.875
[intense music]

27:23.708 --> 27:26.500
Commander, are we to suffer
through another long delay

27:26.583 --> 27:29.208
thanks to
the Centauri ambassador?

27:29.292 --> 27:34.208
- Commander. Ambassador G'Kar.
- Where is Ambassador Mollari?

27:34.292 --> 27:37.583
Oh, Ambassador Mollari is busy
with other important matters

27:37.667 --> 27:39.958
but he's given me full authority
to negotiate

27:40.042 --> 27:41.792
on behalf of
the Centauri Republic.

27:41.875 --> 27:43.333
What! Are you serious?

27:43.417 --> 27:46.875
You expect me to negotiate
with this...this underling?

27:46.958 --> 27:49.083
In the interests of all
our governments

27:49.167 --> 27:50.625
perhaps we can begin the talks

27:50.708 --> 27:52.250
while Ambassador Mollari
is found.

27:52.333 --> 27:54.292
Commander, I've done my best
to cooperate

27:54.375 --> 27:57.417
but this latest insult
cannot be tolerated.

27:57.500 --> 28:01.000
I shall return, but when
Ambassador Mollari is here

28:01.083 --> 28:02.583
and not before!

28:02.667 --> 28:07.083
In the meantime, Ko D'Ath
will represent the Narn Regime.

28:07.167 --> 28:08.917
Thank you, ambassador!

28:09.000 --> 28:11.250
I shall endeavor
to represent our people

28:11.333 --> 28:12.958
to the best of my ability.

28:13.042 --> 28:16.458
Just don't give away
the homeworld.

28:16.542 --> 28:19.125
Keep them talking. I'll going to
find Londo and bring him here.

28:19.208 --> 28:21.250
- What if he refuses?
- Then I hurt him.

28:21.333 --> 28:22.417
[chuckles]

28:22.500 --> 28:25.458
Access to purple files
confirmed.

28:25.542 --> 28:28.083
[intense music]

28:33.375 --> 28:34.625
Londo.

28:34.708 --> 28:36.833
Whatever it is, commander,
I don't have the time.

28:36.917 --> 28:38.875
Londo, I don't wanna
hear about it.

28:38.958 --> 28:40.375
You've turned these talks
into a joke

28:40.458 --> 28:42.333
and that joke may harm
a dozen worlds.

28:42.417 --> 28:43.875
- Now, I don't know what's--
- I know! I know!

28:43.958 --> 28:47.333
I have been a fool and all
because of a pretty face.

28:47.417 --> 28:49.875
Sinclair, I beseech you.
Help me.

28:49.958 --> 28:52.042
- What are you talking about?
- Adira

28:52.125 --> 28:53.792
She has stolen something
from me

28:53.875 --> 28:56.125
something that could-could shake
the very foundation

28:56.208 --> 28:58.708
of the Centauri Republic
and cost me my career!

28:58.792 --> 29:00.167
Have you reported this
to security?

29:00.250 --> 29:01.458
No. I can't.

29:01.542 --> 29:03.542
If it becomes official,
my government is certain

29:03.625 --> 29:04.792
to hear of it.

29:04.875 --> 29:07.042
This calls for
the highest discretion.

29:07.125 --> 29:09.125
And, Sinclair, only you..

29:09.208 --> 29:12.417
...my good and dear friend,
can help me.

29:13.500 --> 29:17.167
If I do...will you agree
to my compromise

29:17.250 --> 29:18.583
on the Euphrates treaty?

29:22.958 --> 29:27.042
- I'll even seal it with a kiss.
- That should make G'Kar's day.

29:27.125 --> 29:29.708
[instrumental music]

29:36.958 --> 29:41.333
Now, let me do the talking. I
know how to handle these types.

29:41.417 --> 29:44.333
Club doesn't open for an hour.

29:44.417 --> 29:47.708
We merely wish to speak
with some of the dancers.

29:47.792 --> 29:49.417
This ain't no data bank, porky.

29:49.500 --> 29:52.500
You wanna see dancers,
come back in an hour.

29:52.583 --> 29:55.542
My good fellow, we don't wish
to cause any trouble.

29:55.625 --> 29:57.250
Too late, numbo.

29:57.333 --> 29:59.042
[grunting]

29:59.125 --> 30:01.000
Well, do something!

30:02.458 --> 30:05.000
[laughs]

30:11.167 --> 30:14.958
Argo was right about you, Ock.
You run things tough.

30:15.042 --> 30:18.083
Argo Big Belly from Red Five?
You know him?

30:18.167 --> 30:20.375
Well enough to know you don't
call him that to his face.

30:20.458 --> 30:23.292
Last one who did wound up
an entree in the alien sector.

30:23.375 --> 30:26.042
[chuckles]
Yeah, Argo has a bad temper.

30:26.125 --> 30:28.542
- Hmm.
- So, what is it you want?

30:28.625 --> 30:33.000
Oh, we're looking to hire
some dancers for a private show.

30:33.083 --> 30:34.750
Argo said you had the best but..

30:34.833 --> 30:36.375
He's right.

30:36.458 --> 30:40.708
- Norg! Get the girls out here.
- Argh! Arr.

30:40.792 --> 30:42.417
Have yourself a good look.

30:42.500 --> 30:45.083
When you're done,
we'll talk price.

30:50.083 --> 30:52.417
I'm stunned.
How did you do that?

30:52.500 --> 30:54.667
I like to know all there's
to know about Babylon 5

30:54.750 --> 30:57.292
and Garibaldi's files
are very thorough.

31:00.875 --> 31:04.625
Now, this is my department.

31:04.708 --> 31:09.792
Ladies, we need some information
about Adira Tyree.

31:09.875 --> 31:13.125
Uh, she's not in her quarters,
but it's imperative

31:13.208 --> 31:17.625
that we find her...immediately.

31:17.708 --> 31:19.958
Adira has a friend named
Gera Akshi.

31:20.042 --> 31:21.750
They roomed together
for a while.

31:21.833 --> 31:24.458
And where might we find
that friend?

31:24.542 --> 31:29.125
(female #1)
'She lives somewhere
in Brown 6, I think.'

31:29.208 --> 31:32.958
- Well?
- Many complications.

31:33.042 --> 31:36.500
- Price high.
- I'll pay for it.

31:36.583 --> 31:39.042
Just have your men
delay Mollari and Sinclair

31:39.125 --> 31:40.583
until you have the girl.

31:40.667 --> 31:45.542
- Kill them if you have to.
- Trouble, maybe?

31:45.625 --> 31:49.250
If there is,
I'll double the price

31:49.333 --> 31:53.458
when I have the girl
and the data crystal in hand.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.667
How we gonna find
this friend of Adira's?

32:01.750 --> 32:04.708
I have a friend or two
down here myself.

32:07.833 --> 32:09.583
I take it these are not them?

32:09.667 --> 32:11.042
[gunfire]

32:11.125 --> 32:12.833
Go!

32:15.083 --> 32:16.792
[thuds]

32:21.083 --> 32:22.292
This way!

32:22.375 --> 32:23.833
[dramatic music]

32:23.917 --> 32:26.250
- Damn! There!
- What?

32:28.833 --> 32:30.792
[panting]

32:30.875 --> 32:31.917
Who sent these men, Londo?

32:32.000 --> 32:33.500
It could only have been Trakis

32:33.583 --> 32:35.208
that worm!

32:43.625 --> 32:44.792
[beeping]

32:44.875 --> 32:45.917
Gun One.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.375
(man on radio)
'Property secured.'

32:47.458 --> 32:48.667
'Abort mission.'

32:48.750 --> 32:50.208
Acknowledged.

32:50.292 --> 32:53.042
They got the woman.

32:53.125 --> 32:54.750
Let's go.

32:58.042 --> 33:00.333
Looks like Trakis has
your dancer.

33:03.917 --> 33:05.458
[indistinct chatter on PA]

33:05.542 --> 33:08.417
Chief, we've had a report of
heavy weapon fire in Brown 7.

33:08.500 --> 33:11.000
- I want you to check it out.
- With pleasure.

33:11.083 --> 33:13.875
Don't worry, I'll keep watch
for your gremlin.

33:16.458 --> 33:18.708
(woman on PA)
'Station one may stand down.'

33:18.792 --> 33:21.458
'Stations two through six,
please report.'

33:26.333 --> 33:29.917
Scarbaldy, send a team
to Brown 7. Code 10-57-Violet.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.583
- 'Roger, chief.'
- Computer.

33:31.667 --> 33:34.125
Monitor gold channels and locate
Lieutenant Commander Ivanova.

33:34.208 --> 33:35.583
(computer)
'Confirmed.'

33:35.667 --> 33:37.958
According to the station's logs,
nothing's left Babylon 5

33:38.042 --> 33:39.875
for the past two hours,
that means Adira

33:39.958 --> 33:41.833
and your files are still aboard.

33:41.917 --> 33:44.833
No doubt in the hands
of that villain Trakis.

33:44.917 --> 33:47.375
I could arrest him.
There are enough charges.

33:47.458 --> 33:50.250
All of which hinge
on my testimony.

33:50.333 --> 33:52.083
When the homeworld hears of this

33:52.167 --> 33:56.417
I will be on a slow ship
to oblivion.

33:56.500 --> 34:00.125
[sighs]
Besides, he might harm Adira.

34:00.208 --> 34:02.875
Londo, she's the one
who got you in this mess.

34:02.958 --> 34:07.792
I know. I know.
Bu there must be some other way.

34:09.167 --> 34:12.333
[sighs]
Alright. I have an idea.

34:14.542 --> 34:17.667
(computer)
Gold Channel opened.

34:17.750 --> 34:22.417
Alright, Lieutenant Gremlin,
this time your butt is mine.

34:22.500 --> 34:25.042
Load icebreaker program
and track transmission.

34:25.125 --> 34:30.125
(computer)
'Commencing.
I-C-E in use.'

34:30.208 --> 34:34.792
'Icebreaker activated.
Stand by.'

34:34.875 --> 34:37.625
'Gold Channel opened.'

34:37.708 --> 34:39.458
He's come out of the coma

34:39.542 --> 34:42.958
but I'm afraid
his condition's much worse.

34:43.042 --> 34:45.292
You'll only have a few minutes,
at best.

34:45.375 --> 34:47.208
I understand.

34:48.625 --> 34:53.750
- Father?
- I-is that you, Susan?

34:53.833 --> 34:55.917
Yes.

34:56.000 --> 35:01.042
Oh, dear God, I never thought
that I'd see your face again.

35:01.125 --> 35:04.667
It makes this easier.

35:04.750 --> 35:11.333
Susan...I know I haven 't been
the best of fathers to you.

35:11.417 --> 35:13.875
'But when your mother..'

35:13.958 --> 35:18.167
'...passed on and your brother
was killed in the war'

35:18.250 --> 35:21.750
'I was too wrapped up
in my own grief'

35:21.833 --> 35:25.458
'to pay attention
to your needs.'

35:25.542 --> 35:29.458
And when you joined Earthforce
against my wishes--

35:29.542 --> 35:31.042
You don't have to say this,
father.

35:31.125 --> 35:34.542
Yes, yes, I must.

35:34.625 --> 35:36.792
There's no more time.

35:36.875 --> 35:40.167
I want you to know..

35:40.250 --> 35:44.333
'...how proud I am of you,
Susan.'

35:44.417 --> 35:46.958
I always have been.

35:47.042 --> 35:50.250
But a father should give
his daughter love

35:50.333 --> 35:54.625
as well as respect,
and in that

35:54.708 --> 35:58.375
I failed you.

35:58.458 --> 36:01.333
I'm sorry.

36:01.417 --> 36:04.292
I'm ashamed.

36:04.375 --> 36:06.750
Forgive me.

36:06.833 --> 36:09.458
[instrumental music]

36:11.125 --> 36:16.500
I...thank you

36:16.583 --> 36:19.042
dushen'ka moya.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.083
[chuckles]

36:22.167 --> 36:25.250
Little soul.

36:25.333 --> 36:27.500
You haven't called me that
since I was..

36:29.500 --> 36:31.208
Papa?

36:31.292 --> 36:33.542
[sighs]

36:38.667 --> 36:39.958
[beeping]

36:41.167 --> 36:43.708
[music continues]

36:48.917 --> 36:52.000
Your proposal is
most interesting, commander.

36:52.083 --> 36:53.833
But why should you wish
to provide me

36:53.917 --> 36:56.542
with an advantage
over Ambassador Mollari?

36:56.625 --> 36:58.750
Not you, ambassador, us.

36:58.833 --> 37:00.542
My government wants certain
concessions

37:00.625 --> 37:02.292
in the Euphrates sector
and I'm sure

37:02.375 --> 37:04.125
the Narn will be grateful
for any help.

37:04.208 --> 37:05.458
Oh, the gratitude of the Narn

37:05.542 --> 37:07.292
is well-known
throughout the galaxy.

37:07.375 --> 37:10.250
But how may I be certain
the merchandise is genuine?

37:10.333 --> 37:11.667
Ms. Winters will sit in
and make sure

37:11.750 --> 37:13.042
the seller is dealing
truthfully.

37:13.125 --> 37:14.833
Earth Alliance will pay her fee,
of course.

37:14.917 --> 37:17.667
- Acceptable.
- Then we have a deal?

37:17.750 --> 37:20.208
Let us say rather
an understanding.

37:22.208 --> 37:26.208
I never knew you could
be so devious, commander.

37:26.292 --> 37:28.875
Coming from you, ambassador,
that's a real compliment.

37:31.375 --> 37:32.667
I won't do it.

37:32.750 --> 37:35.000
It's counter to
all Psi Corps regulations

37:35.083 --> 37:36.625
to interfere
in personal matters.

37:36.708 --> 37:39.792
Ms. Winters, the life of a woman
is at stake

37:39.875 --> 37:42.917
to say nothing of my career.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.167
Is he serious
about that woman's life?

37:50.958 --> 37:54.333
Alright. But I won't break
Psi Corps rules.

37:54.417 --> 37:57.625
The information must come only
from Trakis surface thoughts.

37:57.708 --> 37:59.125
No deliberate probes.

37:59.208 --> 38:01.583
But certainly his thoughts
will all be on the deal.

38:04.042 --> 38:05.375
There is a way.

38:05.458 --> 38:07.292
[indistinct chatter]

38:13.083 --> 38:16.292
- Ambassador G'Kar?
- A great pleasure.

38:16.375 --> 38:19.250
This is Ms. Winters,
our resident telepath.

38:20.458 --> 38:24.167
Telepath?
You said nothing about this.

38:24.250 --> 38:27.125
Oh, it's standard procedure
in such dealings.

38:27.208 --> 38:29.958
I don't like anyone playing
around in my head.

38:30.042 --> 38:33.375
I won't be. My purpose here
is to verify the merchandise.

38:33.458 --> 38:35.792
So it's imperative that you
do not think of anything else

38:35.875 --> 38:37.667
such as the source
of the information

38:37.750 --> 38:41.708
your intent in selling it
or where Adira Tyree is now.

38:41.792 --> 38:43.042
What?

38:44.458 --> 38:45.750
What is it?

38:47.208 --> 38:49.625
The alien sector,
somewhere on level four.

38:49.708 --> 38:52.250
Security, she's in
the alien sector, level four.

38:52.333 --> 38:54.000
Affirmative.

38:56.333 --> 39:00.375
That is for Adira
...and this is for me.

39:03.833 --> 39:06.375
[dramatic music]

39:15.042 --> 39:18.125
My dear, G'Kar, how can I ever
thank you?

39:18.208 --> 39:20.083
You have saved my career

39:20.167 --> 39:23.542
and the honor of the entire
Centauri Republic.

39:23.625 --> 39:25.042
What?

39:25.125 --> 39:26.958
[laughs]

39:27.042 --> 39:28.667
[grunts]
Oh!

39:31.042 --> 39:33.625
[instrumental music]

39:42.792 --> 39:45.875
Mr. Garibaldi,
shouldn't you be in Brown 7?

39:45.958 --> 39:47.917
It's taken care of.

39:49.542 --> 39:51.042
Is there anything else?

39:51.125 --> 39:55.958
My gremlin made another call
and this time I tracked it.

39:56.042 --> 39:57.417
And?

39:57.500 --> 39:59.792
You're not gonna believe this,
but it was just

39:59.875 --> 40:02.667
what you originally said.
A computer error.

40:02.750 --> 40:04.375
[instrumental music]

40:04.458 --> 40:08.917
I fixed it and I don't think
it'll happen again.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.333
Will it?

40:12.208 --> 40:13.917
No, it won't.

40:19.375 --> 40:21.958
Buy you a drink?

40:22.042 --> 40:23.750
I'm on duty.

40:31.125 --> 40:34.000
Garibaldi?

40:34.083 --> 40:35.792
Maybe some other time.

40:35.875 --> 40:38.000
[music continues]

40:48.708 --> 40:51.083
[indistinct chatter on PA]

40:51.167 --> 40:54.250
- Adira.
- Londo!

40:54.333 --> 40:57.000
So you're going back to Davo,
huh?

40:57.083 --> 40:58.542
Yes.

40:58.625 --> 40:59.917
Well, you should be just in time

41:00.000 --> 41:02.208
for the blooming
of the Star Laces.

41:02.292 --> 41:05.375
Londo, I..

41:05.458 --> 41:08.708
- I never wanted to hurt you--
- Adira..

41:08.792 --> 41:10.583
I am an old man.

41:10.667 --> 41:14.833
I've been in love many times,
and have been hurt many times.

41:14.917 --> 41:16.875
I'll survive.

41:18.542 --> 41:23.042
Adira.

41:23.125 --> 41:28.292
Commander Sinclair convinced
Trakis to cancel your contract.

41:28.375 --> 41:30.708
He can be a frightening man
that one.

41:30.792 --> 41:34.042
Londo..

41:34.125 --> 41:37.000
...thank you. Thank you.

That's my ship.

41:48.583 --> 41:50.333
[instrumental music]

41:52.042 --> 41:56.292
Adira...you could stay.

41:56.375 --> 41:59.833
Now that we have
seen beneath our masks

41:59.917 --> 42:02.083
we could have great times
together. We..

42:02.167 --> 42:07.792
Londo...you're sweet,
but the wounds are too fresh.

42:10.167 --> 42:14.542
Alright...then take this.

42:16.583 --> 42:21.750
And wear it proudly
as a free woman.

42:21.833 --> 42:26.458
And someday...come back to me.

42:28.167 --> 42:30.708
