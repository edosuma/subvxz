WOMAN:
Hon, you've put it off long enough.

02:28.731 --> 02:29.632
What?

02:29.732 --> 02:31.201
- You know what.
- You know what.

02:31.301 --> 02:32.802
- Negative.
- Negative.

02:32.902 --> 02:34.637
Come on, negative.

02:34.737 --> 02:36.713
- Come on!
- Dear Lord, please protect our Jenna

02:36.813 --> 02:38.408
from the hell of unwanted pregnancy.

02:38.508 --> 02:40.743
I don't need no baby.
I don't want no trouble.

02:40.843 --> 02:42.145
I just want to make pies.

02:42.245 --> 02:44.238
That's all I want to do, make pies.

02:44.338 --> 02:46.116
I thought you weren't sleeping
with your husband no more.

02:46.216 --> 02:47.317
He got her drunk one night.

02:47.417 --> 02:48.351
I should never drink.

02:48.451 --> 02:49.886
I do stupid things
when I drink,

02:49.986 --> 02:50.753
like sleep with my husband.

02:50.853 --> 02:52.222
- Oh, no!
- (gasps)

02:52.322 --> 02:54.057
Looks like a pink line
is forming. Shit.

02:54.157 --> 02:55.091
One line or two lines?

02:55.191 --> 02:56.392
One line or two lines?

02:56.492 --> 02:57.927
Two lines! The control line
and the other line,

02:58.027 --> 03:00.230
- the bad line, the "yes" line.
- Let me see that now.

03:00.330 --> 03:03.133
Two lines, two definite lines.
There's no mistaking them.

03:03.233 --> 03:05.602
- (knocking on door)
- MAN: What's going on in there?

03:05.702 --> 03:07.770
We have customers!
Where are my waitresses?

03:07.870 --> 03:10.573
Hold your balls straight, Cal.
Jenna ain't feeling well.

03:10.673 --> 03:11.741
CAL:
What's wrong with her?

03:11.841 --> 03:13.610
It's none of your business,
you blowhard.

03:13.710 --> 03:15.211
I'm fine, Cal!
We'll be right out.

03:15.311 --> 03:18.261
CAL: Hurry up!

03:19.065 --> 03:20.016
(sighs)

03:20.116 --> 03:21.584
Hon, you okay?

03:21.684 --> 03:23.520
Shh. I'm inventing a new pie

03:23.620 --> 03:24.888
in my head.

03:24.988 --> 03:27.938
Tomorrow's blue plate special.

03:28.741 --> 03:31.741
I'm calling it
"I Don't Want

03:32.345 --> 03:34.430
Earl's Baby Pie."

03:34.530 --> 03:37.100
I don't think we can write that
on the menu board, hon.

03:37.200 --> 03:38.635
Then I'll just call it
"Bad Baby Pie."

03:38.735 --> 03:40.727
What's in it, honey?

03:40.827 --> 03:46.004
It's a quiche of egg and Brie cheese
with a smoked ham center.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.778
Sounds good, baby.

03:48.878 --> 03:51.998
I ain't never going to get
away from Earl now.

03:52.098 --> 03:55.098
(hard rock playing)

03:58.271 --> 04:00.456
You going to tell him?

04:00.556 --> 04:02.392
I'm not sure.

04:02.492 --> 04:05.228
If my plan comes true and I
can make my big escape from him

04:05.328 --> 04:07.764
in a couple months,
maybe he never even has to know.

04:07.864 --> 04:09.566
Are you sure it's his child?

04:09.666 --> 04:11.534
You know everything I do.
I ain't never cheated.

04:11.634 --> 04:12.569
- Ah...
- I'd never do that.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.103
- Eh...
- I feel sorry for you, Jenna.

04:14.203 --> 04:15.805
I mean, I'd do anything

04:15.905 --> 04:18.241
to meet a man, and Becky's
husband is a senile fruitcake.

04:18.341 --> 04:21.177
- Dawn!
- Well, I'm sorry, it's true.

04:21.277 --> 04:22.612
But now here you are,

04:22.712 --> 04:24.781
married to this handsome guy.

04:24.881 --> 04:25.782
Who's got very good hair.

04:25.882 --> 04:27.217
Who's got very good hair.

04:27.317 --> 04:28.284
And pregnant with

04:28.384 --> 04:29.752
a little girl.

04:29.852 --> 04:30.853
How do you know it's a girl?

04:30.953 --> 04:32.946
- We don't know it's a girl.
- But neither of us

04:33.046 --> 04:35.023
would trade places with you for
one second.

04:35.123 --> 04:36.859
Now would we, Becky?

04:36.959 --> 04:38.228
No, we wouldn't, Dawn.
No, we wouldn't.

04:38.328 --> 04:40.320
Except, just once in my life,

04:40.420 --> 04:42.565
I'd like to be able to make

04:42.665 --> 04:43.633
a pie half as good

04:43.733 --> 04:45.301
as Jenna can make a pie.

04:45.401 --> 04:46.936
- Yeah, me, too.
-JENNA: Oh, come on.

04:47.036 --> 04:48.805
So what if I can make a decent pie?

04:48.905 --> 04:50.640
- Who cares?
- Look at this, Jenna.

04:50.740 --> 04:54.027
As you can plainly see,
my right boob is much higher

04:54.127 --> 04:55.245
than my left boob

04:55.345 --> 04:56.412
and Dawn here has

04:56.512 --> 04:58.648
pasty, pasty skin.

04:58.748 --> 05:01.451
I'm stuck in a marriage
to Droolin, Phil the Invalid,

05:01.551 --> 05:02.852
and Dawn eats TV dinners alone,

05:02.952 --> 05:04.487
but still, we wouldn't
rather be you.

05:04.587 --> 05:07.537
I do have pasty, pasty skin.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.141
(car horn blaring)

05:12.578 --> 05:15.298
Yeah, I know, you're here.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.100
See you tomorrow, honey.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.134
Good luck.

05:18.234 --> 05:19.535
- And if you do tell him you're...
- Shh!

05:19.635 --> 05:20.370
Hey.

05:20.470 --> 05:21.904
Hey.

05:22.004 --> 05:24.954
(heavy metal playing)

05:25.191 --> 05:27.277
BECKY: Hiya there, Earl.

05:27.377 --> 05:29.545
We all just agreed that your hair
is super attractive.

05:29.645 --> 05:30.713
Hooray for you.

05:30.813 --> 05:33.763
- Woo-hoo!
- Woo-hoo!

05:36.202 --> 05:39.262
I don't care if she is a pie genius.

05:39.439 --> 05:41.427
I wouldn't trade places with her.

05:41.527 --> 05:44.327
No, me neither.

05:44.427 --> 05:47.377
(hard rock playing)

05:47.714 --> 05:50.714
You don't look happy to see me.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.502
Are you happy to see me?

05:52.602 --> 05:53.936
Yeah, I'm happy to see you.

05:54.036 --> 05:55.171
Even brought you a piece

05:55.271 --> 05:57.540
of today's special,
"Kick In The Pants Pie."

05:57.640 --> 05:58.641
Cinnamon spice custard.

05:58.741 --> 06:01.691
You don't give me a kiss.

06:03.896 --> 06:06.896
Well, give me one.

06:07.734 --> 06:09.319
There. That's more like it.

06:09.419 --> 06:10.953
Where's that money

06:11.053 --> 06:12.188
you made today?

06:12.288 --> 06:13.356
Right here in my pocket.

06:13.456 --> 06:16.406
Well, now, hand it over.

06:18.010 --> 06:19.362
Not much here, is there?

06:19.462 --> 06:21.197
Slow day, you know.

06:21.297 --> 06:23.273
Yeah, you been having
more and more of those.

06:23.373 --> 06:26.169
I'm really not sure it's worth
you working there anymore.

06:26.269 --> 06:28.271
I think I might rather have you
be at home

06:28.371 --> 06:29.806
making me pies all day long.

06:29.906 --> 06:31.040
(chuckling)

06:31.140 --> 06:32.608
You didn't ask me

06:32.708 --> 06:34.010
how my day was.

06:34.110 --> 06:35.011
How was your day?

06:35.111 --> 06:36.045
Ask me like you

06:36.145 --> 06:37.847
care about it.

06:37.947 --> 06:40.516
How was your day, Earl?

06:40.616 --> 06:44.186
Well, you know,
Johnson's on my case again,

06:44.937 --> 06:47.657
about the mortgages and everything.

06:47.757 --> 06:50.659
But I don't make the bank policy,
and I told him that,

06:50.759 --> 06:53.496
- but he doesn't listen.
- (hard rock fades)

06:53.596 --> 06:56.232
- (dreamy lullaby plays)
-JENNA: "I Hate My Husband Pie"

06:56.332 --> 06:58.768
You take bitter sweet chocolate
and don't sweeten it.

06:58.868 --> 07:00.403
You make it in to a pudding

07:00.503 --> 07:02.205
and drown it in caramel.

07:02.305 --> 07:03.806
- (hard rock resumes)
- You're not listening to me.

07:03.906 --> 07:04.874
Yeah, I am.

07:04.974 --> 07:06.075
What I say?

07:06.175 --> 07:08.244
You were bitching about Mr. Johnson.

07:08.344 --> 07:10.580
What were the exact words I said?

07:10.680 --> 07:12.248
Well, I mean, I can't repeat
them verbatim...

07:12.348 --> 07:15.250
You don't listen to me!

07:15.350 --> 07:18.301
Hurts my feelings.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.789
Please just say you're sorry

07:19.889 --> 07:22.658
so I can let you out this car
so you can make my dinner.

07:22.758 --> 07:24.734
I'm sorry, Earl,
for not being able

07:24.834 --> 07:25.762
to repeat your words verbatim,

07:25.862 --> 07:27.263
something I should be able to do.

07:27.363 --> 07:29.165
Whenever I need it.

07:29.265 --> 07:32.215
Whenever you need it.

07:32.652 --> 07:35.652
All right, then.

07:40.326 --> 07:43.326
You look handsome tonight, Early.

07:43.529 --> 07:45.915
Thank you, honey.

07:46.015 --> 07:47.650
(chuckles)

07:47.750 --> 07:50.520
It's been a long time since
you called me Early.

07:50.620 --> 07:52.922
I like it.

07:53.022 --> 07:55.591
And you look pretty tonight.

07:55.691 --> 07:57.675
Maybe a little tired is all.

07:57.775 --> 08:01.584
You're not eating
your spaghetti pie. Why not?

08:01.814 --> 08:05.718
I'm thinking I want to borrow
some money from you.

08:05.818 --> 08:08.787
And my answer to that,
of course, is no.

08:08.887 --> 08:11.891
There's a big pie Bake-Off in
Jonesville in a couple months.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.075
And I'd like to go.

08:13.175 --> 08:15.812
And my answer to that,
of course, is no.

08:15.912 --> 08:17.647
Prize money is pretty good.

08:17.747 --> 08:21.100
- (fork clatters)
- Why do you need money?

08:21.200 --> 08:23.319
I give you everything
you need, don't I?

08:23.419 --> 08:24.887
Absolutely.

08:24.987 --> 08:27.490
You want for nothing, don't you?

08:27.590 --> 08:29.826
Yes, Earl, I want for nothing.

08:29.926 --> 08:32.876
I mean, your pies ain't bad.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.998
But what's so important about that
when you got me to take care of?

08:36.097 --> 08:38.501
That's a good point, Earl.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.577
(chuckles)

08:40.677 --> 08:43.553
(snoring)

08:44.657 --> 08:47.657
(crickets chirping)

08:53.366 --> 08:56.366

09:09.148 --> 09:12.148
(woman singing aria in Italian)

09:21.027 --> 09:22.712
(door creaks open)

09:22.812 --> 09:25.762
WOMAN:Jenna Hunterson.

09:31.938 --> 09:33.926
(knocking at door)

09:34.026 --> 09:35.391
MAN: Hello, Mrs. Bunterson.

09:35.491 --> 09:37.467
Hunterson.

09:37.567 --> 09:38.794
Who are you?

09:38.894 --> 09:39.862
I'm your doctor.

09:39.962 --> 09:41.631
Oh, wow, you brought me a pie.

09:41.731 --> 09:43.566
How nice.
You know what?

09:43.666 --> 09:46.619
I've only been here a few weeks,
but already I am genuinely

09:46.719 --> 09:48.404
impressed with the hospitality of this place.

09:48.504 --> 09:50.506
You're not my doctor.

09:50.606 --> 09:51.574
Lily Mueller is my doctor.

09:51.674 --> 09:52.808
This pie is for her.

09:52.908 --> 09:54.343
It's Marshmallow Mermaid,
her favorite.

09:54.443 --> 09:55.745
Well, she's semiretired now.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.380
Just sort of happened this morning.
She kind of quit.

09:57.480 --> 09:59.148
We didn't have time to call anybody.

09:59.248 --> 10:01.232
But Dr. Mueller delivered me.

10:01.332 --> 10:02.685
I mean, she's been my doctor forever.

10:02.785 --> 10:04.220
I really liked and trusted her.

10:04.320 --> 10:07.089
Maybe you could really like
and trust me, too?

10:07.189 --> 10:09.182
I've never even seen you before.

10:09.282 --> 10:10.760
Yeah, I just got hired.

10:10.860 --> 10:13.229
Long story, making it short,
this is still

10:13.329 --> 10:16.247
Dr. Mueller's practice,
I'm the junior doctor on staff.

10:16.347 --> 10:18.327
Um, Just moved here from
Connecticut two weeks ago.

10:18.427 --> 10:20.102
Dr. Mueller had a class
over the summer

10:20.202 --> 10:23.104
and I was a student of hers,
and is this story boring you?

10:23.204 --> 10:24.407
No... yes.

10:24.507 --> 10:25.508
Sorry, anyway,

10:25.608 --> 10:27.009
it's nice to meet you.

10:27.109 --> 10:28.611
What's your name again?

10:28.711 --> 10:29.679
I'm Dr. Jim Pomatter.

10:29.779 --> 10:30.746
Okay.

10:30.846 --> 10:32.448
- And you are?
-Jenna Hunterson

10:32.548 --> 10:34.183
Jenna Hunterson
It is nice to meet you.

10:34.283 --> 10:35.785
So... What seems to be the problem?

10:35.885 --> 10:37.987
Well, I seem to be pregnant.

10:38.087 --> 10:39.021
Good.

10:39.121 --> 10:40.256
Good for you.
Congratulations.

10:40.356 --> 10:41.724
Thanks, but I don't want this baby.

10:41.824 --> 10:44.327
Oh, well, we don't perform... uh...

10:44.427 --> 10:45.528
No, I'm keeping it,

10:45.628 --> 10:47.621
I'm just telling you I'm
not so happy about it,

10:47.721 --> 10:48.931
like everybody else might be.

10:49.031 --> 10:51.267
So maybe you can be sensitive
and not congratulate me

10:51.367 --> 10:53.343
and make a big deal
every time you see me.

10:53.443 --> 10:55.104
I'm having the baby,
and that's that.

10:55.204 --> 10:56.439
It's not a party, though.

10:56.539 --> 10:59.241
Got it, okay, not a party.

10:59.341 --> 11:01.544
Uh, well, then, why don't we, um...

11:01.644 --> 11:03.312
we'll have to do a blood test,

11:03.412 --> 11:04.914
make sure you're pregnant
and then we'll check

11:05.014 --> 11:06.382
for diseases, hormone levels,
stuff like that?

11:06.482 --> 11:07.583
Sounds like a plan.

11:07.683 --> 11:10.618
Okay, well, the nurse
will be right in.

11:10.718 --> 11:13.703
Um... don't go anywhere.

11:15.041 --> 11:15.992
(door closes)

11:16.092 --> 11:18.828
Nowhere to go.

11:18.928 --> 11:19.829
(knocking at door)

11:19.929 --> 11:21.297
Come in.

11:21.397 --> 11:24.347
Hi, Jenna, have a seat.

11:24.717 --> 11:28.054
Okay, I'm going to give
you this pie now, Dr. Pomatter.

11:28.154 --> 11:30.039
Oh, thank you.

11:30.139 --> 11:32.408
Thank you very much.
Look at that.

11:32.508 --> 11:34.877
You know what?Just push-push
all of those off on to the floor.

11:34.977 --> 11:36.512
Go ahead, push them off.
That's fine. Just...

11:36.612 --> 11:39.562
I'll get to those later.

11:46.472 --> 11:48.858
(sighs)

11:48.958 --> 11:52.545
Well, un-congratulations-
you're definitely having a baby.

11:52.645 --> 11:54.363
Un-thank you.

11:54.463 --> 11:57.166
So for the next eight months,
if you need me, I'm here.

11:57.266 --> 11:59.135
If you have any questions,
just give a call.

11:59.235 --> 12:00.503
We'll be doing some tests.

12:00.603 --> 12:02.605
All of which I'll tell you
about before they happen.

12:02.705 --> 12:03.873
And I'm going to give you

12:03.973 --> 12:07.458
a prescription for,
uh, prenatal vitamins.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.513
And do you have any,
uh, questions for me?

12:11.613 --> 12:12.882
What kind of questions?

12:12.982 --> 12:14.617
I don't know.
Concerns about your pregnancy?

12:14.717 --> 12:16.693
Do's and don'ts?

12:16.793 --> 12:18.254
Anything you're wondering about?

12:18.354 --> 12:19.822
Exercise, sex...

12:19.922 --> 12:20.890
I don't really do much

12:20.990 --> 12:22.358
of either of those things, so...

12:22.458 --> 12:25.376
Okay, any diet concerns?

12:25.476 --> 12:27.897
Not really. I mean,
just eat healthy, right?

12:27.997 --> 12:30.533
Eat healthy, um, avoid certain
cheeses, certain fish...

12:30.633 --> 12:33.551
The receptionist, she can
give you a list of good and bad

12:33.651 --> 12:35.738
foods for your pregnancy,
general do's and don'ts.

12:35.838 --> 12:36.906
Okay.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.998
And here is your prescription.

12:39.098 --> 12:42.024
I'll just... sorry.

12:43.229 --> 12:46.365
And, uh, it was very nice
to meet you, Jenna.

12:46.465 --> 12:48.017
And I'll want to see you again

12:48.117 --> 12:49.485
- in about three weeks.
- Okay.

12:49.585 --> 12:52.535
- Okay.
- (banging thud)

12:54.640 --> 12:56.959
I do have one question.

12:57.059 --> 12:58.127
Shoot.

12:58.227 --> 13:00.476
How pregnant am I, exactly?

13:00.576 --> 13:01.897
Very pregnant.

13:01.997 --> 13:04.366
There's really only one degree
of pregnancy, so to speak.

13:04.466 --> 13:06.602
No, I mean, uh, how far along am I?

13:06.702 --> 13:08.938
Uh, about six weeks,

13:09.038 --> 13:10.406
give or take.

13:10.506 --> 13:15.436
Yeah, that was Earl getting me
drunk that night, all right.

13:17.029 --> 13:20.029
(country music plays)

13:20.833 --> 13:22.885
CAL:
You're late.

13:22.985 --> 13:24.978
By six minutes. I'm sorry.
The bus was late.

13:25.078 --> 13:27.423
Why doesn't your damn husband
buy you a car already?

13:27.523 --> 13:29.992
'cause he don't want
me goin, nowhere.

13:30.092 --> 13:32.628
And you, late again.

13:32.728 --> 13:35.948
You are inches away
from being fired, missy.

13:36.048 --> 13:38.300
Oh, Just try firing me,
you old bucket of cheese.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.503
Who you calling a bucket
of cheese, you heifer?

13:40.603 --> 13:42.595
Now get to work before
I fire your ass.

13:42.695 --> 13:45.621
Calm down, you psychotic ape.

13:45.858 --> 13:47.676
(door opening)

13:47.776 --> 13:51.091
Hey, what are you doing?
Close the door!

13:53.866 --> 13:55.217
How's the doc?

13:55.317 --> 13:56.418
Fine, it was fine.

13:56.518 --> 13:58.721
New doctor, a man.

13:58.821 --> 14:00.389
A man, wow.

14:00.489 --> 14:02.792
Is he single?
Maybe he's good for Dawn.

14:02.892 --> 14:04.693
No, I think he was wearing a ring.

14:04.793 --> 14:06.295
Weird guy, nervous.

14:06.395 --> 14:07.496
From Connecticut.

14:07.596 --> 14:09.832
Hey, honey, could you do me a favor?

14:09.932 --> 14:10.900
What?

14:11.000 --> 14:12.501
Old Joe just came in
and sat in my station.

14:12.601 --> 14:14.804
Could you take him?
I can't deal with him today.

14:14.904 --> 14:16.888
You're better with him than I am.

14:16.988 --> 14:18.240
Yeah, sure, I'll take him.

14:18.340 --> 14:21.290
Thanks, hon, you're a trooper.

14:21.393 --> 14:22.745
Oh.

14:22.845 --> 14:25.014
What? What's wrong?

14:25.114 --> 14:27.750
You okay? You going to be sick?

14:27.850 --> 14:29.885
I'm okay.
(moans gently)

14:29.985 --> 14:31.787
Just nauseous for a second.

14:31.887 --> 14:33.155
(knocking at door)

14:33.255 --> 14:36.205
CAL:
Hurry up, let's get to work!

14:37.743 --> 14:39.895
(country music plays)

14:39.995 --> 14:42.945
(patrons conversing indistinctly)

14:45.384 --> 14:47.036
Hi, Joe.

14:47.136 --> 14:48.637
How you doing today, my friend?

14:48.737 --> 14:51.473
What can I get you?

14:51.573 --> 14:53.175
This is my pie diner.

14:53.275 --> 14:54.476
I own it.

14:54.576 --> 14:56.011
I know you do, Joe.

14:56.111 --> 14:58.214
And I think it's warm in here.
I know I'm warm.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.549
I'll tell Cal, hon.

15:00.649 --> 15:03.118
They keep all my businesses
too warm on the inside.

15:03.218 --> 15:07.106
My gas station, my supermarket,
my Laundromat...

15:07.206 --> 15:09.558
But this is my favorite business.

15:09.658 --> 15:11.393
Joe's Pie Shop.

15:11.493 --> 15:12.828
I'm Joe.

15:12.928 --> 15:15.030
And I will not tolerate it being

15:15.130 --> 15:16.565
too damn warm in here.

15:16.665 --> 15:17.800
I hear you, Joe.

15:17.900 --> 15:19.068
Turn the air on.

15:19.168 --> 15:20.803
Yes, sirree, bub.

15:20.903 --> 15:22.271
Okay.

15:22.371 --> 15:24.673
I want two glasses of water, no ice.

15:24.773 --> 15:26.508
Two glasses, no problem.

15:26.608 --> 15:27.843
- Two glasses.
- Right.

15:27.943 --> 15:29.778
No ice.

15:29.878 --> 15:33.432
And I want the "Bad Baby Quiche Pie"
with tomato on the side,

15:33.532 --> 15:34.884
on its own plate.

15:34.984 --> 15:36.085
No potatoes with that?

15:36.185 --> 15:38.721
Did I say anything about potatoes?

15:38.821 --> 15:40.022
Where'd you get potatoes from?

15:40.122 --> 15:41.757
No potatoes, tomato.

15:41.857 --> 15:43.125
On its own plate.

15:43.225 --> 15:44.260
Salt and pepper.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.327
That everything?

15:45.427 --> 15:46.629
No.

15:46.729 --> 15:47.796
I want orange juice.

15:47.896 --> 15:48.964
But don't bring that first.

15:49.064 --> 15:50.032
Bring the water first.

15:50.132 --> 15:53.192
Bring the orange juice
with the meal.

15:53.552 --> 15:56.889
Okay, listen to my horoscope
before you skedaddle away.

15:56.989 --> 15:59.742
"Aquarius...

15:59.842 --> 16:04.063
Smooth sailing today as Mars
enters your inner circle."

16:04.163 --> 16:06.448
Whatever the hell that means.

16:06.548 --> 16:10.636
"The ones you love will listen
carefully to you today,

16:10.736 --> 16:14.173
just make sure you're careful
with what you say."

16:14.273 --> 16:16.926
Hmm.
I don't have ones I love.

16:17.026 --> 16:18.127
Want to hear yours?

16:18.227 --> 16:19.261
Uh, I'm Aquarius, too, hon.

16:19.361 --> 16:20.763
I don't have ones I love either.

16:20.863 --> 16:21.830
Just ones I live with.

16:21.930 --> 16:22.898
Excuse me, I feel like

16:22.998 --> 16:25.948
I'm going to be sick.

16:26.485 --> 16:28.570
(toilet flushes)

16:28.670 --> 16:31.620
(sighs)

16:31.757 --> 16:34.757
(tap running)

16:38.163 --> 16:39.548
You okay, sweetie?

16:39.648 --> 16:40.916
Yeah, I'm okay.

16:41.016 --> 16:44.803
Good. Listen, um, I have
a five-minute blind date tonight

16:44.903 --> 16:46.891
with an insurance
salesman named Pete.

16:46.991 --> 16:49.291
Five foot 10, 37,
all his hair, nice picture,

16:49.391 --> 16:50.993
- loves fishing.
- Five-minute date?

16:51.093 --> 16:52.895
Can't the guy pay for
the whole thing?

16:52.995 --> 16:55.945
Yeah, see, um, I have this idea.

16:56.081 --> 16:58.078
I'm meeting men through
personal ads,

16:58.178 --> 16:59.802
but I just give them five minutes.

16:59.902 --> 17:01.303
Whether or not we
like each other,

17:01.403 --> 17:03.172
- we just have five minutes together.
- Huh.

17:03.272 --> 17:05.507
That way, you know,
if the guy makes me sick,

17:05.607 --> 17:07.675
I don't waste a whole evening.
Anyway, I'm supposed

17:07.776 --> 17:09.278
to meet this guy at
7:00 at Banshee's.

17:09.377 --> 17:11.780
I was wondering if you would
do a full makeup for me

17:11.880 --> 17:13.382
here in the bathroom,
before I leave?

17:13.482 --> 17:15.117
A full makeup for five minutes?

17:15.217 --> 17:18.203
Well, yeah, it's very important
to make a good first impression.

17:18.303 --> 17:20.521
I mean, wh-what if he's
Prince Charming?

17:20.622 --> 17:22.790
There is no such thing.

17:22.891 --> 17:23.992
Whatever.

17:24.093 --> 17:25.493
Will you do that for me?

17:25.594 --> 17:26.662
Yeah, of course.

17:26.762 --> 17:28.329
Oh, would you also make me

17:28.430 --> 17:30.299
your "Falling In Love
Chocolate Mousse Pie"?

17:30.399 --> 17:31.667
That is my favorite pie.

17:31.767 --> 17:33.936
What the heck, I'll do
it during my break, okay?

17:34.036 --> 17:34.970
You are the queen

17:35.070 --> 17:36.305
of kindness and goodness.

17:36.405 --> 17:39.355
(bluesy music playing)

17:40.359 --> 17:43.045
(patrons conversing indistinctly)

17:43.145 --> 17:45.138
You with child?

17:45.238 --> 17:47.198
Shh, quiet.

17:47.298 --> 17:50.052
I've seen that look on
a woman's face before.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.754
Name was Annette.

17:51.854 --> 17:53.956
I made sweet love to her
all through the summer

17:54.056 --> 17:55.324
of 1948.

17:55.424 --> 17:56.725
She got that sick look

17:56.825 --> 18:00.312
on her face like you had
all through the fall.

18:00.412 --> 18:02.297
I almost married her right up.

18:02.397 --> 18:03.799
She lost the baby, though.

18:03.899 --> 18:04.967
Close call.

18:05.067 --> 18:06.168
When you due?

18:06.268 --> 18:07.669
Shh, Joe...

18:07.769 --> 18:10.172
Don't want Cal to hear.
You can't lose my job.

18:10.272 --> 18:12.508
I'm trying to save money
so I can leave my husband.

18:12.608 --> 18:14.592
Why, what's wrong with him?

18:14.692 --> 18:16.278
Hey, there's no salt and pepper

18:16.378 --> 18:18.680
on the table. I asked
for salt and pepper

18:18.780 --> 18:21.214
and no ice in my juice glass.

18:21.314 --> 18:23.276
- Can't you get nothing I say right?
- I'll go get

18:23.376 --> 18:24.787
your salt and pepper and juice
with no ice.

18:24.887 --> 18:26.021
But you got to promise me

18:26.121 --> 18:27.589
you'll keep your mouth shut
about this baby.

18:27.689 --> 18:28.924
What baby?

18:29.024 --> 18:31.760
Good man.

18:31.860 --> 18:33.695
BECKY:
Honey, Earl's on the phone.

18:33.795 --> 18:35.771
- Tell him I'm busy.
- You don't talk to him,

18:35.871 --> 18:38.000
he might come over here
and cause a scene again.

18:38.100 --> 18:39.034
Yeah, okay.

18:39.134 --> 18:40.235
Can I ask you a question?

18:40.335 --> 18:41.503
Is it my imagination,

18:41.603 --> 18:43.639
or is my left one drooping
down even more today?

18:43.739 --> 18:45.874
I'm starting to feel like something Picasso
would have made.

18:45.974 --> 18:47.967
Do me a favor, hon,
get Old Joe some O.J.-

18:48.067 --> 18:49.611
no ice- or he'll bite your head off.

18:49.711 --> 18:52.646
- And some salt and pepper.
- You got it.

18:52.746 --> 18:54.516
Hello, Earl.

18:54.616 --> 18:56.151
Good, good.

18:56.251 --> 18:58.887
No, I-I am glad you called.

18:58.987 --> 19:01.937
You picking me up tonight?

19:02.107 --> 19:06.272
No, that's fine, I'll ask
Becky to give me a ride.

19:07.412 --> 19:10.165
Yes, I know you work hard.

19:10.265 --> 19:12.768
Earl, I've got to get back.

19:12.868 --> 19:14.002
We're busy here today.

19:14.102 --> 19:15.003
Okay.

19:15.103 --> 19:16.672
Bye.

19:16.772 --> 19:19.722
I love you, too.

19:28.534 --> 19:31.534
##

19:45.617 --> 19:48.617
##

19:55.227 --> 19:58.227
Mm.

19:59.631 --> 20:02.631
"Falling In Love Pie."

20:03.669 --> 20:05.787
BECKY:
Oh, pretty outfit, Dawn.

20:05.887 --> 20:07.122
Thank you.

20:07.222 --> 20:09.258
It's a little tight
in the butt, I fear.

20:09.358 --> 20:11.793
Oh, no worries. Men like a little meat
back there, don't they, Jenna?

20:11.893 --> 20:13.228
I have no idea what men like.

20:13.328 --> 20:14.663
Speaking of more meat,

20:14.763 --> 20:17.749
does Earl have any clue at all
that you're pregnant?

20:17.849 --> 20:20.335
No, he don't notice, and
I'm never going to tell him.

20:20.435 --> 20:21.670
I'm just going to run away.

20:21.770 --> 20:22.671
Wow.

20:22.771 --> 20:24.206
How much money you got saved?

20:24.306 --> 20:25.941
Not much, $1,200

20:26.041 --> 20:27.442
and I can save
another couple hundred

20:27.542 --> 20:28.911
before the Jonesville Bake-Off.

20:29.011 --> 20:30.579
How much is that prize money?

20:30.679 --> 20:32.748
$25,000, hon.

20:32.848 --> 20:34.616
Wow. What pie you going to bake?

20:34.716 --> 20:36.018
I'm not sure.

20:36.118 --> 20:38.520
I was thinking I'd make one
of my real unusual ones,

20:38.620 --> 20:39.888
like my mama used to make.

20:39.988 --> 20:41.323
One where you wouldn't think
the ingredients

20:41.423 --> 20:42.824
would all go together, but they do.

20:42.924 --> 20:43.825
Huh.

20:43.925 --> 20:46.094
Dawn, you're beautiful.

20:46.194 --> 20:48.297
Your skin looks like
a normal person's.

20:48.397 --> 20:50.732
Thank you.

20:50.832 --> 20:52.034
I know what you should do

20:52.134 --> 20:53.869
with that prize money, Jenna.

20:53.969 --> 20:56.004
You should open your own pie shop.

20:56.104 --> 20:58.097
Oh, yeah.

20:58.197 --> 21:00.409
You should have your own little
pie shop somewhere.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.678
Somewhere where they could
really use a little pie shop,

21:02.778 --> 21:04.754
like Europe or New Jersey.

21:04.854 --> 21:07.549
Wow, my own pie shop.

21:07.649 --> 21:09.918
Jenna's Pie Palace.

21:10.018 --> 21:11.887
Jenna's Pastry Heaven.

21:11.987 --> 21:13.589
Okay, back to reality for a minute.

21:13.689 --> 21:15.557
Hey, can you give me
a ride home, Becky?

21:15.657 --> 21:17.259
Earl don't want
to pick me up tonight.

21:17.359 --> 21:18.660
No, take the bus.

21:18.760 --> 21:20.862
I can't drive you.
I've got somewhere to go.

21:20.962 --> 21:22.097
Oh, where you going?

21:22.197 --> 21:23.832
I can't tell you that.

21:23.932 --> 21:24.833
- What?
- What?

21:24.933 --> 21:26.568
Yet! I can't tell you

21:26.668 --> 21:27.903
that yet.

21:28.003 --> 21:29.004
Why not?

21:29.104 --> 21:30.706
Got to go!

21:30.806 --> 21:32.674
You have fun on
your five-minute date.

21:32.774 --> 21:34.009
Use a five-minute condom.

21:34.109 --> 21:35.077
- Hey, wait a minute.
- Bye.

21:35.177 --> 21:36.178
Hey!

21:36.278 --> 21:37.713
(wry chuckle)

21:37.813 --> 21:38.780
(door closes)

21:38.880 --> 21:39.815
(sighs)

21:39.915 --> 21:43.123
Well, whatever it is,
I hope it's good.

21:43.223 --> 21:44.720
Go look at yourself, hon.

21:44.820 --> 21:46.989
This guy's not going
to know what hit him.

21:47.089 --> 21:48.023
(giggles)

21:48.123 --> 21:51.073
Go on.

21:52.010 --> 21:54.396
Oh!

21:54.496 --> 21:56.565
Look what you did.

21:56.665 --> 21:58.649
You made me almost pretty.

21:58.749 --> 22:00.836
What do you mean "almost pretty"?

22:00.936 --> 22:02.404
You're lovely.

22:02.504 --> 22:05.173
Look at yourself.

22:05.273 --> 22:07.109
Oh...

22:07.209 --> 22:08.744
- Hey, sweetie?
- Hmm?

22:08.844 --> 22:11.346
You think you can drop me off at the bus stop
on your way to Banshee's?

22:11.446 --> 22:14.396
Yeah.

22:15.634 --> 22:18.634
(dreamy lullaby plays)

22:21.340 --> 22:23.358
"Baby Screaming It's Head Off

22:23.458 --> 22:26.161
in the Middle of the Night
and Ruining My Life Pie"

22:26.261 --> 22:29.615
New York-style cheesecake,
brandy brushed,

22:29.715 --> 22:32.715
with pecans and nutmeg.

22:38.390 --> 22:39.508
Hello.

22:39.608 --> 22:41.584
Jenna?

22:41.684 --> 22:42.511
What?

22:42.611 --> 22:44.179
Hi. Dr. Pomatter.

22:44.279 --> 22:45.247
Yeah.

22:45.347 --> 22:47.149
What are you doing here?

22:47.249 --> 22:48.984
Oh, my car wouldn't
start this morning-

22:49.084 --> 22:50.118
God knows why.

22:50.218 --> 22:51.420
Got to take the bus home.

22:51.520 --> 22:52.821
Where do you live?

22:52.921 --> 22:54.189
Uh, Stanton Grove.

22:54.289 --> 22:55.424
Oh, it's nice over there.

22:55.524 --> 22:58.442
Yeah, yeah, it's nice.

22:58.542 --> 23:03.472
If you like trees, which, you know,
who doesn't like trees?

23:03.982 --> 23:06.101
It's a long walk.

23:06.201 --> 23:07.769
Do you mind if I sit down?

23:07.869 --> 23:10.138
Not at all.

23:10.238 --> 23:13.188
Thanks.

23:14.693 --> 23:17.145
So you're a waitress.

23:17.245 --> 23:18.213
I'm a waitress.

23:18.313 --> 23:19.614
Where do you work?

23:19.714 --> 23:22.578
Uh, a little diner off Highway 27.

23:22.678 --> 23:24.186
Joe's Pie Diner.

23:24.286 --> 23:25.987
Oh, wow.

23:26.087 --> 23:29.317
Sounds like a veritable
factory of pie.

23:29.441 --> 23:30.692
(chuckles)

23:30.792 --> 23:32.961
I've never been there.
Is it... is it... is it good?

23:33.061 --> 23:34.830
Yes, it's very good.

23:34.930 --> 23:37.199
We make all the pies there fresh.

23:37.299 --> 23:41.687
Breakfast pies, dinner pies,
27 different varieties of pie.

23:41.787 --> 23:44.072
And a new one that
I create every day.

23:44.172 --> 23:47.192
I was just inventing a new one
in my head when you walked up.

23:47.292 --> 23:50.529
Did you make that marshmallow pie
that you brought me?

23:50.629 --> 23:53.248
Yes, I did.
"Marshmallow Mermaid Pie."

23:53.348 --> 23:55.217
I invented it when I
was nine years old,

23:55.317 --> 23:56.718
in my mermaid phase.

23:56.818 --> 23:59.421
That was probably the best pie
I've ever tasted in my life.

23:59.521 --> 24:01.223
That pie, it was...

24:01.323 --> 24:04.343
that pie was biblically good,
that's how good it was.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.762
That pie could win pie contests

24:06.862 --> 24:08.130
and ribbons and things.
It was...

24:08.230 --> 24:09.297
Thank you.

24:09.397 --> 24:12.299
Yeah.

24:12.399 --> 24:15.103
You know, there was a pie diner
right near where I grew up.

24:15.203 --> 24:17.205
And I used to go there every day
after school.

24:17.305 --> 24:20.859
I had a mad crush on this
waitress named Beatrice.

24:20.959 --> 24:22.010
She looked tragically cute

24:22.110 --> 24:24.479
in her uniform,

24:24.579 --> 24:28.667
and years later, I was doing my
residency and she came in

24:28.767 --> 24:30.318
with an emergency ovarian cyst.

24:30.418 --> 24:32.053
I actually treated her.

24:32.153 --> 24:33.855
Wow.

24:33.955 --> 24:35.524
That must have been
something for you.

24:35.624 --> 24:39.279
Well, she was at least
50 years old by then.

24:42.347 --> 24:45.100
Life does funny kind
of things sometimes.

24:45.200 --> 24:46.735
Yes, it does.

24:46.835 --> 24:49.785
Yes, it does.

24:50.288 --> 24:52.908
You want to hear something
else kind of funny?

24:53.008 --> 24:55.000
When I saw you sitting here
alone in your uniform,

24:55.100 --> 24:56.812
I... I had a flashback.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.313
You made me think of her.

24:58.413 --> 25:00.982
You kind of remind me of her

25:01.082 --> 25:01.983
when she was younger.

25:02.083 --> 25:05.033
Wow. What a thing to say.

25:05.303 --> 25:06.922
Yeah, sorry, it was a compliment.

25:07.022 --> 25:08.557
No, I know.

25:08.657 --> 25:11.193
That's why it made me uncomfortable.

25:11.293 --> 25:12.861
You're blushing.

25:12.961 --> 25:14.229
Sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

25:14.329 --> 25:16.598
No, it was a nice thing to hear. I...

25:16.698 --> 25:19.000
Nobody ever notices me in that way.

25:19.100 --> 25:21.076
Well, somebody
noticed you that way-

25:21.176 --> 25:23.102
otherwise you wouldn't be in
the condition you're in.

25:23.202 --> 25:24.739
- Oh, him?
- Yeah.

25:24.839 --> 25:27.709
He don't count.
He's just my husband.

25:27.809 --> 25:30.445
I'm kidding. Of course he counts.
He's my husband.

25:30.545 --> 25:31.913
(chuckles)
Oh!

25:32.013 --> 25:33.482
Oh, here's the bus.

25:33.582 --> 25:35.350
Call me whenever you need me, Jenna.

25:35.450 --> 25:38.703
I'm here for all your
questions and concerns.

25:38.803 --> 25:40.255
(rock music plays)

25:40.355 --> 25:42.691
Please?

25:42.791 --> 25:45.360
Please?

25:45.460 --> 25:48.410
Please?

25:49.447 --> 25:52.447
Please?

25:52.984 --> 25:55.984
Come on, honey.

25:58.490 --> 26:01.276
I-I feel sick in my stomach.

26:01.376 --> 26:04.326
You know, it's been over a month.

26:05.063 --> 26:08.123
I feel about as sexy
as a tree stump.

26:10.402 --> 26:13.402
You ain't never been sexier.

26:15.173 --> 26:19.678
Am I imagining it, or are
your boobies getting bigger?

26:20.679 --> 26:23.098
Like they grew a size
practically overnight.

26:23.198 --> 26:26.148
That's crazy, Earl.

26:27.052 --> 26:30.452
I got to be with you
or I'm going to die.

26:34.259 --> 26:37.259
Come on, baby, kiss me back.

26:40.699 --> 26:43.699
Move up, baby.
Come on, honey.

26:45.804 --> 26:48.156
Say something sexy to me.

26:48.256 --> 26:49.991
What do you want me to say?

26:50.091 --> 26:53.041
(groaning)

26:54.946 --> 26:57.946
(sighing)

27:02.854 --> 27:05.854
(sighs)

27:06.992 --> 27:09.992
That was...
That was great.

27:10.228 --> 27:12.814
That was great, baby.
Mmm...

27:12.914 --> 27:13.915
Wasn't it?

27:14.015 --> 27:16.965
Yes, absolutely wonderful.

27:18.470 --> 27:21.470
(yawning)

27:22.807 --> 27:25.807
(country-pop playing)

27:26.911 --> 27:29.911
## (man singing)

27:42.627 --> 27:45.627
## (continues)

28:07.352 --> 28:08.570
Oh, no, no, no, no.

28:08.670 --> 28:10.705
No, no, no.
I don't want you as my waitress.

28:10.805 --> 28:12.440
I want her, Dawn.

28:12.540 --> 28:13.942
That lady right there.

28:14.042 --> 28:15.010
(mouthing)

28:15.110 --> 28:16.411
Oh, well, I'm sorry, honey,

28:16.511 --> 28:17.846
but you're sitting in my station.

28:17.946 --> 28:19.514
All the tables in Dawn's
station are taken.

28:19.614 --> 28:22.250
No, but I don't want you.
I want her.

28:22.350 --> 28:24.653
Well, if you want to eat
in this diner,

28:24.753 --> 28:28.006
-you got to sit here, and I've got to wait on you.
- She a good friend of yours?

28:28.106 --> 28:30.094
What can you tell me about her?
What's she...

28:30.194 --> 28:33.396
- What are her likes and dislikes?
What does she look for in a man?

28:33.496 --> 28:33.979
Uh, honey,

28:34.079 --> 28:36.731
I'm just here to bring you pie
or coffee or something like that.

28:36.831 --> 28:38.299
I don't dispense romantic advice.

28:38.399 --> 28:39.601
What if I paid you?

28:39.701 --> 28:41.036
Excuse me, I'm going to go

28:41.136 --> 28:43.805
talk to Dawn for a minute,
see if she won't

28:43.905 --> 28:48.580
- come deal with you herself.
- Oh, that'd be wonderful.

28:51.329 --> 28:54.329
## (ends)

28:54.933 --> 28:56.017
(groaning)

28:56.117 --> 28:58.520
- You've got to help me.
- What is going on?

28:58.620 --> 28:59.954
That guy, his name is Ogie,

29:00.054 --> 29:01.389
short for Oklahoma.

29:01.489 --> 29:03.482
I was supposed to meet someone
named Pete last night.

29:03.582 --> 29:04.659
Instead, he sent Ogie.

29:04.759 --> 29:06.735
It was the worst five minutes in my life.

29:06.835 --> 29:08.863
I made the mistake of
telling him I work here.

29:08.963 --> 29:11.399
JENNA:
How could a five-minute date be that bad?

29:11.499 --> 29:12.801
He took me through the entire medical

29:12.901 --> 29:14.102
and psychiatric history of his family.

29:14.202 --> 29:15.203
Oh, no.

29:15.303 --> 29:17.005
And he told me he wants to marry me.

29:17.105 --> 29:18.807
- Oh, no!
- Marry me!

29:18.907 --> 29:21.476
And he's not giving up, not ever giving up,
that's what he said.

29:21.576 --> 29:23.569
First guy that pays any
attention to me in years,

29:23.669 --> 29:25.645
and he turns out to be
the mad stalking elf.

29:25.745 --> 29:27.697
I'm telling you, Jenna,
your makeup job was too good,

29:27.797 --> 29:28.683
and your "Magic Love Pie..."?

29:28.783 --> 29:29.851
I'm sorry.

29:29.951 --> 29:32.253
- What am I supposed to do?
- You go over there

29:32.353 --> 29:33.822
and you tell him you're not interested.

29:33.922 --> 29:35.657
- I told him that last night.
- Tell him better.

29:35.757 --> 29:39.959
- Come with me.
- I can't. I've got to go throw up.

29:40.059 --> 29:43.071
Fine, I'll just
go over there myself.

29:45.884 --> 29:47.235
I'm a very persistent man, Dawn.

29:47.335 --> 29:49.537
I know what I want.
I know what makes me happy.

29:49.637 --> 29:50.605
Blah, blah, blah.

29:50.705 --> 29:52.874
I'm a tax auditor.

29:52.974 --> 29:55.949
I make $31,000 a year plus bonuses.

29:56.261 --> 29:58.249
I drive a very nice compact car.

29:58.349 --> 30:00.749
I eat at all the best restaurants

30:00.849 --> 30:02.450
within a 50-mile radius.

30:02.550 --> 30:03.551
I love my mother.

30:03.651 --> 30:05.286
What else do you need
to know about me?

30:05.386 --> 30:07.756
- How to make you go away.
- You can't.

30:07.856 --> 30:09.524
You can't make me go away.

30:09.624 --> 30:11.192
'Cause I don't take
no for an answer.

30:11.292 --> 30:13.895
I'll just keep coming back
and coming back

30:13.995 --> 30:15.830
till finally your resistance is weakened.

30:15.930 --> 30:17.632
'cause we were meant
to be together, Dawn.

30:17.732 --> 30:18.833
You don't know me!

30:18.933 --> 30:19.968
Oh, yes, I do.

30:20.068 --> 30:22.170
You're Dawn.

30:22.270 --> 30:25.220
And you inspire poetry in me.

30:25.590 --> 30:27.909
Here's one I'm making up
right here on the spot.

30:28.009 --> 30:29.277
"Dawn, can I bring you joy

30:29.377 --> 30:32.327
"like you brung me sunshine?

30:32.497 --> 30:35.416
Can I hold you a minute
and it turns into forever?"

30:35.516 --> 30:36.985
- Do you like that one?
- No!

30:37.085 --> 30:39.921
Okay, how about a spontaneous
tidbit that rhymes?

30:40.021 --> 30:41.790
"All my life I've met harlots,

30:41.890 --> 30:44.259
"but you are a queen...

30:44.359 --> 30:46.161
da, da, da, da, da, da, da...
something between..."

30:46.261 --> 30:47.996
I... I got to work on that one.

30:48.096 --> 30:49.464
Leave me alone.

30:49.564 --> 30:51.199
I can't leave you alone...

30:51.299 --> 30:53.001
'cause I'm in love with you, Dawn.

30:53.101 --> 30:54.569
And you're going to be my wife.

30:54.669 --> 30:56.037
Listen to me.

30:56.137 --> 30:58.006
You make me sick!

30:58.106 --> 30:59.941
I think you're nothing
but a crazy little freak,

31:00.041 --> 31:01.810
and I wish you would
go away and die!

31:01.910 --> 31:04.345
(gasping)

31:04.445 --> 31:07.081
(sobbing)

31:07.181 --> 31:10.116
(mutters)

31:10.216 --> 31:13.201
I... I...

31:13.872 --> 31:16.124
(sobbing)

31:16.224 --> 31:19.174
Oh, I'm sorry, hon.

31:24.649 --> 31:26.629
Jenna.

31:26.729 --> 31:27.735
You're always on the phone.

31:27.835 --> 31:28.837
Sorry, this is important.

31:28.937 --> 31:29.971
Yeah, what's so important?

31:30.071 --> 31:33.006
Can I please have some privacy?

31:33.106 --> 31:36.091
Hi, uh, is Dr. Pomatter there?

31:36.261 --> 31:40.086
This is, um, Jenna Hunterson.
I'm his patient.

31:40.298 --> 31:42.517
(humming tune)

31:42.617 --> 31:44.385
Hi, Dr. Pomatter.

31:44.485 --> 31:46.287
It's Jenna Hunterson.

31:46.387 --> 31:48.556
Um, listen, I'm sure it's nothing,

31:48.656 --> 31:51.459
but you said to call
if I had any concerns.

31:51.559 --> 31:55.554
And this morning, um,
I'm bleeding a little bit.

31:56.481 --> 31:59.784
No, no, it's very, very light,
like spotting.

31:59.884 --> 32:01.872
Come in to see you?

32:01.972 --> 32:04.739
Okay, uh... tomorrow morning?

32:04.839 --> 32:07.175
You in at 7:00?

32:07.275 --> 32:08.610
Oh, okay, then.

32:08.710 --> 32:11.379
Glad you're open so early
so I won't be late for work.

32:11.479 --> 32:13.615
Thanks.

32:13.715 --> 32:15.416
See you then.

32:15.516 --> 32:18.418
Who are you seeing at 7:00 tomorrow?

32:18.518 --> 32:21.739
Not telling you, 'cause you don't
tell me your secrets neither.

32:21.839 --> 32:24.192
Oh, so this is a secret.

32:24.292 --> 32:25.894
No, I'm just going
to see the doctor.

32:25.994 --> 32:28.062
There, that's my big secret.
What's yours?

32:28.162 --> 32:30.565
Can't say. Not yet.

32:30.665 --> 32:32.433
- Why the hell not?
- Well... (gasps)

32:32.533 --> 32:35.236
- Hey!
- Hey!

32:35.336 --> 32:37.572
Don't you have customers?

32:37.672 --> 32:39.440
How come you can't never say
one nice thing ever

32:39.540 --> 32:40.508
like, "How are you, Jenna?"

32:40.608 --> 32:41.943
or "Nice to see you today, Jenna"

32:42.043 --> 32:43.478
or "Great apple pie today, Jenna"?

32:43.578 --> 32:45.880
All you ever say is stuff like,
"Don't you have customers?

32:45.980 --> 32:48.882
- Get out of the kitchen. Get back to work."
- Don't you have customers?

32:48.982 --> 32:52.382
Get out of the kitchen.
Get back to work.

33:03.348 --> 33:06.348
##

33:19.197 --> 33:22.197
(doorbell rings)

33:25.737 --> 33:26.788
Hello, Jenna.

33:26.888 --> 33:27.922
Hello.

33:28.022 --> 33:31.075
Here. I brought you
some "Peachy Keen" tarts.

33:31.175 --> 33:32.994
Wow, thanks.

33:33.094 --> 33:35.263
You're welcome.

33:35.363 --> 33:37.498
- Where's everybody else?
- Uh, I came in a little early

33:37.598 --> 33:39.801
to see you.
Nobody else is here.

33:39.901 --> 33:41.636
Oh.

33:41.736 --> 33:44.072
That's why I'm opening the door for you.

33:44.172 --> 33:47.122
- I see.
- So come in.

33:52.330 --> 33:54.649
Now, you say the bleeding was very mild?

33:54.749 --> 33:55.717
Yeah.

33:55.817 --> 33:57.485
And has it stopped?

33:57.585 --> 34:00.535
Yeah, I only saw it the one time.

34:05.043 --> 34:08.043
Okay, good.

34:08.813 --> 34:10.364
Well, you can
get dressed now

34:10.465 --> 34:12.800
and, uh, meet me in my office
when you're ready.

34:12.900 --> 34:15.103
You, you're not going to examine me?

34:15.203 --> 34:16.371
No, no need. No.

34:16.471 --> 34:17.672
Just get dressed and we'll talk.

34:17.772 --> 34:20.722
Okay.

34:23.327 --> 34:26.327
(door closes)

34:27.665 --> 34:28.683
Hi.

34:28.783 --> 34:31.733
Hi. Come on in. Sit down.

34:34.605 --> 34:37.492
Oh, my God.

34:37.592 --> 34:39.659
(chuckles)

34:39.760 --> 34:42.496
Mm.

34:42.597 --> 34:44.899
Well, am I okay? I mean,
is something wrong with me?

34:44.998 --> 34:47.034
No.

34:47.135 --> 34:48.335
Mm!

34:48.436 --> 34:51.382
No, there's nothing wrong with you.

34:51.483 --> 34:53.574
Uh, light spotting
is a perfectly normal symptom

34:53.674 --> 34:54.574
in early pregnancy.

34:54.675 --> 34:55.909
Were you concerned
about a miscarriage?

34:56.010 --> 34:58.960
Not really.

34:59.964 --> 35:02.250
Is that everything you have to say?

35:02.350 --> 35:04.919
Um...

35:05.019 --> 35:07.388
yes.

35:07.488 --> 35:10.438
- No.
- Well, what?

35:11.209 --> 35:14.209
I...

35:16.147 --> 35:17.899
Nothing.

35:17.999 --> 35:20.735
Um, you can go now.
Uh... I'll see you

35:20.835 --> 35:23.104
at your next regularly scheduled
appointment, and again, don't

35:23.204 --> 35:25.706
- hesitate to call...
- To call you if I have any questions or concerns.

35:25.806 --> 35:28.042
Exactly.

35:28.142 --> 35:30.978
Why'd you have me come
all the way in here

35:31.078 --> 35:33.114
if spotting's a perfectly normal symptom

35:33.214 --> 35:34.482
in early pregnancy?

35:34.582 --> 35:37.702
I mean, I had to get up early,
take a bus, walk five blocks,

35:37.802 --> 35:40.088
just to hear that spotting
is a perfectly normal symptom?

35:40.188 --> 35:43.138
I have no response to that.

35:43.574 --> 35:47.645
And what time does this office
normally open, Doctor, 8:30?

35:47.745 --> 35:49.530
9:00.

35:49.630 --> 35:50.965
9:00?

35:51.065 --> 35:54.185
So-So you came in here two hours
early just to tell me

35:54.285 --> 35:56.137
that spotting is a perfectly
normal symptom?

35:56.237 --> 35:59.187
Well, it would seem that way, yes.

36:01.192 --> 36:02.710
Good-bye, Dr. Pomatter.

36:02.810 --> 36:04.078
Good-bye, Jenna.

36:04.178 --> 36:05.646
I think you're strange.

36:05.746 --> 36:08.149
I'm not sure I want you
to be my doctor anymore.

36:08.249 --> 36:09.550
You make me uncomfortable.

36:09.650 --> 36:11.119
I'm sorry, Jenna.
I'm really sorry.

36:11.219 --> 36:13.421
Whatever it is I do,
I will not do it anymore.

36:13.521 --> 36:15.323
You should not be uncomfortable
at this time.

36:15.423 --> 36:17.399
- You're doing it again.
- How? What did I...?

36:17.499 --> 36:19.827
I don't know, you know,
that nice-guy-talky thing you do.

36:19.927 --> 36:22.137
You just... Oh, forget it.

36:27.251 --> 36:30.251
Damn! My purse!

36:31.522 --> 36:34.522
You forgot your pur...

36:38.095 --> 36:39.147
(gasps)

36:39.247 --> 36:40.648
Hey!

36:40.748 --> 36:43.698
Don't walk away from me.

36:44.702 --> 36:46.690
Well, what do you want?

36:46.790 --> 36:48.289
I want to see you again.

36:48.389 --> 36:50.558
I want to talk to you
somewhere outside of here.

36:50.658 --> 36:52.426
Maybe we could have
a coffee or something.

36:52.526 --> 36:55.263
I can't have coffee.
It's on the bad food list you gave me.

36:55.363 --> 36:57.899
- What kind of doctor are you?
- Well, you don't have to have coffee.

36:57.999 --> 36:59.300
You could have water or fruit juice.

36:59.400 --> 37:00.635
That's a bad idea.

37:00.735 --> 37:02.470
I'm married. You're married.

37:02.570 --> 37:03.471
I'm pregnant.

37:03.571 --> 37:04.505
- You're my doctor.
- Uh...

37:04.605 --> 37:06.007
You're right, it's crazy.
It's unethical

37:06.107 --> 37:08.376
on my part. I...

37:08.476 --> 37:12.216
(choir chanting
over classical orchestration)

37:22.106 --> 37:23.491
Wait!

37:23.591 --> 37:24.892
No kissing in the street.

37:24.992 --> 37:26.527
I have a very jealous husband.

37:26.627 --> 37:27.695
He'd kill you

37:27.795 --> 37:29.664
if he ever saw us.
He don't like when other men

37:29.764 --> 37:30.965
- even look at me.
- Is he large?

37:31.065 --> 37:32.233
He's large enough,
and he drives

37:32.333 --> 37:34.502
- right past here on the way to work.
- Well, maybe we

37:34.602 --> 37:37.238
shouldn't be standing
in the street then.

37:37.338 --> 37:38.706
I've got to go make pies.

37:38.806 --> 37:40.782
It'll take me time to walk
the five blocks,

37:40.882 --> 37:42.825
wait for the bus.
I don't want to be late.

37:42.925 --> 37:44.877
- Cal gets mad when I'm late.
- Let me drive you.

37:44.977 --> 37:46.347
No. Yes.

37:46.447 --> 37:49.397
Please.

37:55.539 --> 37:57.425
Well, thank you for the tarts.

37:57.525 --> 37:59.594
They were unbelievably delicious.

37:59.694 --> 38:01.062
"Delicious" is not even

38:01.162 --> 38:03.331
a good enough word
for what they are. They...

38:03.431 --> 38:06.406
I mean, what you do with food is...

38:07.218 --> 38:09.570
unearthly.
It's sensual.

38:09.670 --> 38:10.838
Does anybody else appreciate...?

38:10.938 --> 38:11.872
You're welcome.

38:11.972 --> 38:14.922
So, um...

38:15.793 --> 38:17.912
Do we...? I mean, what do we...?

38:18.012 --> 38:19.780
- Dr. Pomatter, I'll call you
- Can I...

38:19.880 --> 38:22.940
if I have any questions or concerns.

38:32.977 --> 38:35.977
(engine starts)

38:54.665 --> 38:57.665
(dreamy lullaby plays)

38:57.768 --> 39:00.771
"'Earl Murders Me

39:16.070 --> 39:18.139
Excuse me. What?

39:18.239 --> 39:20.675
I'm wondering if you have
to sleep outside my diner,

39:20.775 --> 39:22.410
'cause maybe you don't have no home.

39:22.510 --> 39:23.444
I have a home.

39:23.544 --> 39:24.478
Right,

39:24.578 --> 39:26.781
and a bad husband, I remember.

39:26.881 --> 39:28.516
You got lipstick all over your face.

39:28.616 --> 39:29.550
What?

39:29.650 --> 39:30.685
Your lipstick
is all smudged,

39:30.785 --> 39:32.987
like someone gave you a good one.

39:33.087 --> 39:35.489
I'm going inside now.

39:35.589 --> 39:38.491
Once you're done wiping away
all your indiscretions,

39:38.591 --> 39:39.994
I'll be sitting in my booth

39:40.094 --> 39:43.347
wanting fresh-squeezed
orange juice, no ice,

39:43.447 --> 39:45.333
and a "Spanish Dancer Pie"

39:45.433 --> 39:48.383
with potato crust.

39:54.024 --> 39:57.024

Here you go.

40:02.249 --> 40:04.752
"Dear Elizabeth..."
Do you know this column?

40:04.852 --> 40:07.021
It's for the lonely hearts.

Elizabeth just gives her
some nonsense

40:43.858 --> 40:46.427
about not killing herself.

40:46.527 --> 40:48.503
I love living vicariously

40:48.603 --> 40:50.931
through the pain and suffering
of others.

40:51.031 --> 40:53.984
I don't believe for one second
you're as mean as you play.

40:54.084 --> 40:55.836
You tip me better than anyone.

40:55.936 --> 40:57.438
Oh, what do you know?

40:57.538 --> 41:00.408
Bring me more water
for this empty glass.

41:00.508 --> 41:03.077
Mm-hmm.

No. No.

Mommy!

41:08.382 --> 41:09.283
What did I say?

41:09.383 --> 41:10.418
No.

41:10.518 --> 41:12.253
All right, now stop it, sugar, please?

41:12.353 --> 41:14.455
- Okay, you can have chocolate milk, okay?
- (screams)

41:14.555 --> 41:16.924
I'm sorry. You can have
as much chocolate milk as you want.

41:18.125 --> 41:20.118
Okay, all right, you little...

41:20.218 --> 41:21.395
Okay.

41:21.495 --> 41:22.563

41:22.663 --> 41:24.647
Listen, you can have
chocolate milk, okay?

41:24.747 --> 41:27.961
Here, darling,
we bought you something,

41:28.185 --> 41:29.403
a present.

41:29.503 --> 41:30.838
That's sweet.
You shouldn't have.

41:30.938 --> 41:32.406
Open it.

41:32.506 --> 41:35.456
Okay.

41:36.126 --> 41:38.114
Oh, it's a book.

41:38.214 --> 41:41.128
"What a Mama You're Going to Be"

41:41.365 --> 41:42.716
Oh, look at that.

41:42.816 --> 41:45.352
We know you didn't initially
have a strong happiness

41:45.452 --> 41:46.554
about this whole baby thing,

41:46.654 --> 41:47.888
but she is coming anyway.

41:47.988 --> 41:49.223
We don't know it's a she.

41:49.323 --> 41:51.325
We figured we'd give you something

41:51.425 --> 41:52.893
that every woman
is supposed to read.

41:52.993 --> 41:55.029
And every woman is supposed
to read something like that...

41:55.129 --> 41:56.197
we think.

41:56.297 --> 41:57.331
Well, thanks.

41:57.431 --> 42:00.000
- You best read and absorb it.
- Hey, you know,

42:00.100 --> 42:02.803
I was thinking. Have you ever
heard about those people

42:02.903 --> 42:04.705
who sell their babies
for lots of money

42:04.805 --> 42:06.073
through, like, lawyers and stuff?

42:06.173 --> 42:08.342
Jenna, you can't sell your baby.
That's a horrible thought.

42:08.442 --> 42:09.343
I was just thinking,

42:09.443 --> 42:10.845
if I did, I might
make enough money

42:10.945 --> 42:12.279
to finally get away from Earl.

42:12.379 --> 42:14.915
I mean, at this point, the baby
is the only real financial asset

42:15.015 --> 42:16.817
I have if I don't win
that pie contest.

42:16.917 --> 42:20.137
I am going to pretend
that you are not saying this.

42:20.237 --> 42:21.922
Not everybody wants
to be a mama, Dawn.

42:22.022 --> 42:24.158
That don't make me a bad person.

42:24.258 --> 42:25.626
You're not getting
any more affectionate

42:25.726 --> 42:26.627
towards that little baby?

42:26.727 --> 42:27.661
Not at all?

42:27.761 --> 42:29.754
I respect this baby's right to thrive.

42:29.854 --> 42:31.031
I do nothing harmful to it.

42:31.131 --> 42:33.467
I don't drink,
I watch my diet, but no.

42:33.567 --> 42:35.803
I feel nothing like affection.

42:35.903 --> 42:38.772
Maybe that man smothered
all the affection out of me.

42:38.872 --> 42:41.822
I don't know.

42:43.394 --> 42:45.479
Well, I got to get back to work.

42:45.579 --> 42:46.747
Yeah, uh, breakfast crowd's
heating up.

42:46.847 --> 42:48.082
Yeah.

42:48.182 --> 42:49.350
Hey, thanks for the book.

42:49.450 --> 42:51.285
All right.

42:51.385 --> 42:55.272
Jenna, there's all these
cool things to do in here.

42:55.372 --> 42:58.476
Um, there's a little scrapbook
section in the back,

42:58.576 --> 43:01.745
where you can put pictures
of your pregnant belly as it develops.

43:01.845 --> 43:04.882
Oh, and there's a place where
you can write your first letter to your baby.

43:04.982 --> 43:06.133
- Oh.
- Right here.

43:06.233 --> 43:08.569
Right in the middle.

43:08.669 --> 43:11.619
Okay, Dawn, thanks.

43:15.192 --> 43:18.192
First Letter To My Baby.

43:19.096 --> 43:20.781
First letter.

43:20.881 --> 43:23.050
OLD JOE:
Where's my water?

43:23.150 --> 43:26.100
"Dear baby."

43:30.574 --> 43:31.525
"Dear baby,

43:31.625 --> 43:34.295
"if I was writing you a letter,

43:34.395 --> 43:38.560
"it would probably sound
something like an apology

43:39.283 --> 43:41.035
"I know everyone deserves a mama

43:41.135 --> 43:44.037
"who'd want a nice baby
such as yourself-

43:44.137 --> 43:48.449
"who was also a good wife,
a fine member of society.

43:48.549 --> 43:51.795
"And I can't rightly say
that I'm any of that.

43:51.895 --> 43:54.932
"and I'm not sure the world
is such a fine place

43:55.032 --> 43:56.650
"to be bringing you.

43:56.750 --> 44:00.137
"Many of the people I've met
are not worth meeting.

44:00.237 --> 44:05.337
"Many of the things that happen
are not worth living through.

44:06.110 --> 44:09.213
"And you shouldn't take it
personal, baby,

44:09.313 --> 44:12.232
"if I don't seem like all the
other mamas-to-be,

44:12.332 --> 44:14.735
"jumping all over themselves
with joy.

44:14.835 --> 44:18.522
"I frankly don't know
what I got to give you, baby.

44:18.622 --> 44:22.092
"What if I leave Earl and don't
win that contest next week

44:22.192 --> 44:23.243
"and don't have no money?

44:23.343 --> 44:25.613
"What the hell am I going to do
with you then?"

44:25.713 --> 44:28.663
(Earl groans)

44:30.134 --> 44:32.122
You sure is getting fat, baby.

44:32.222 --> 44:33.621
(chuckles)

44:33.721 --> 44:35.697
"All my life, baby,

44:35.797 --> 44:39.512
"the only thing I ever want
to do is runaway.

44:40.077 --> 44:43.077
"What kind of mama is that?

44:45.215 --> 44:47.935
"I wish I could feel other things, baby.

44:48.035 --> 44:50.804
"Like excitement
that you're with me now

44:50.904 --> 44:53.674
"or faith that I'll be a good mama,

44:53.774 --> 44:55.542
"even if my life
ain't such a good place

44:55.642 --> 44:57.645
"and the world as I see it
ain't so pretty

44:57.745 --> 45:00.731
"like they'd have you believe
in this book.

45:00.831 --> 45:04.146
"Anyway, I'm writing
this letter to you.

45:04.835 --> 45:08.660
"It sounds more like a letter
to me, don't it?

45:09.540 --> 45:12.393
"Love, Mama."

45:12.493 --> 45:15.443
(horn honking)

45:34.231 --> 45:37.231
Where you going, Jenna?

45:38.068 --> 45:39.920
Nowhere, Earl.

45:40.020 --> 45:42.823
I-I mean, to work.

45:42.923 --> 45:45.873
Then why you got a suitcase?

45:48.712 --> 45:49.663
(groans)

45:49.763 --> 45:51.365
Earl!

45:51.465 --> 45:54.865
- Shut up and get in the car.
- (sobbing)

46:03.794 --> 46:06.794
(sniffling)

46:09.533 --> 46:12.119
Pie-baking contest, huh?

46:12.219 --> 46:17.489
Yeah, I was just going to go up there
and win and surprise you.

46:18.142 --> 46:21.142
No, you're lying.

46:21.912 --> 46:26.417
You ain't never gone to
a contest before in your life.

46:27.284 --> 46:28.235
You're lying to me.

46:28.335 --> 46:30.771
Earl, don't...

46:30.871 --> 46:32.272
Why you lying to me?

46:32.372 --> 46:33.340
I'm pregnant!

46:33.440 --> 46:36.390
(tires squealing)

46:54.912 --> 46:56.597
When was you going to tell me?

46:56.697 --> 46:59.615
After I won the pie contest.

46:59.715 --> 47:03.030
Well, you ain't going
to no pie contest.

47:03.420 --> 47:06.650
You know what?
You ain't going nowhere.

47:09.426 --> 47:12.279
Here's the thing, wife-

47:12.379 --> 47:16.400
What if you decide to love
the baby more than you love me?

47:16.500 --> 47:18.605
Women do it all the time.

47:18.705 --> 47:22.072
They have a baby and then
it's to hell with the man.

47:22.172 --> 47:24.160
You're jealous of the baby?

47:24.260 --> 47:25.926
No, I don't get jealous.

47:26.026 --> 47:28.695
It's below me.

47:28.795 --> 47:29.963
I'm just talking it out.

47:30.063 --> 47:31.265
I'm talking my feelings out.

47:31.365 --> 47:34.315
And I know how women get.

47:34.985 --> 47:38.640
And I'm just not sure I want
that happening.

47:39.790 --> 47:41.241
I'd tell you to
get rid of it,

47:41.341 --> 47:42.743
but I want you
in the same place

47:42.843 --> 47:46.838
as me in the hereafter,
if you know what I mean.

47:47.898 --> 47:50.050
Maybe if you promise me

47:50.150 --> 47:52.953
that you wouldn't love the baby
more than you love me.

47:53.053 --> 47:54.221
You know?

47:54.321 --> 47:56.356
That you'd make
a real effort to love me more.

47:56.456 --> 47:58.492
If I need something,

47:58.592 --> 48:00.727
you'd keep taking care of it.

48:00.827 --> 48:02.262
You'd hold on to me more.

48:02.362 --> 48:05.312
I come first- not any baby.

48:06.884 --> 48:09.169
Well, can you make
Early that promise?

48:09.269 --> 48:11.438
Absolutely.

48:11.538 --> 48:12.439
Then say "I promise."

48:12.539 --> 48:14.141
I promise.

48:14.241 --> 48:17.176
Say "I promise I will not love the baby

48:17.276 --> 48:18.512
more than I love you, Early."

48:18.612 --> 48:21.014
I promise I will not love the baby

48:21.114 --> 48:24.064
more than I love you, Early.

48:25.035 --> 48:27.621
How about that?

48:27.721 --> 48:30.781
We're going to have
ourselves a baby.

48:32.209 --> 48:35.209
A baby boy.

48:36.280 --> 48:38.899
I bet it happened that night
I got you all drunk.

48:38.999 --> 48:41.335
(chuckles)

48:41.435 --> 48:42.703
Where you going?

48:42.803 --> 48:45.753
Gotta throw up.

48:47.758 --> 48:50.758
(woman singing Italian aria)

48:51.561 --> 48:55.811
WOMAN:
Mrs. Hunterson, the doctor will see you now.

48:56.733 --> 48:57.684
(door closes)

48:57.784 --> 49:00.734
Hi there.
I'm Nurse Norma.

49:01.338 --> 49:03.490
I'll be helping Dr. Pomatter

49:03.590 --> 49:06.460
with your ultrasound
examination today.

49:06.560 --> 49:08.095
You have any questions?

49:08.195 --> 49:10.430
This is where we look at
the baby's heartbeat?

49:10.530 --> 49:12.833
Yes, among other things.

49:12.933 --> 49:14.968
You nervous?

49:15.068 --> 49:16.904
No. Do I seem nervous?

49:17.004 --> 49:18.839
Yes, you do.

49:18.939 --> 49:20.073
That's normal.

49:20.173 --> 49:22.676
Everybody's nervous before
their first ultrasound.

49:22.776 --> 49:24.645
I'm not nervous, though.

49:24.745 --> 49:26.079
Okay, you're not nervous.

49:26.179 --> 49:27.080
(knock at door)

49:27.180 --> 49:29.816
Come in. I'm dressed.

49:29.916 --> 49:31.151
Hello, Doctor.

49:31.251 --> 49:32.352
Hello, Mrs. Hunterson.

49:32.452 --> 49:33.587
How have you been feeling?

49:33.687 --> 49:34.655
Fine.

49:34.755 --> 49:35.722
No problems?

49:35.822 --> 49:36.957
Nope.

49:37.057 --> 49:39.226
You had no questions or concerns
this past month.

49:39.326 --> 49:42.276
No, I certainly did not.

49:43.814 --> 49:46.099
Okay, well, lie back.

49:46.199 --> 49:49.769
Uh, Norma, would you get
the lights for me?

49:51.254 --> 49:53.774
All right,
this isn't going to hurt at all.

49:53.874 --> 49:55.850
It's just going to be a little cold.

49:55.950 --> 49:58.745
(rubber gloves snapping)

49:58.845 --> 50:00.080
Here we go.

50:00.180 --> 50:03.130
All right.

50:06.136 --> 50:09.136
Okay, Just a little pressure.

50:10.307 --> 50:13.307
Now what are we looking at?

50:15.579 --> 50:17.597
Ah, there we are.

50:17.697 --> 50:20.267
We are definitely having a baby.

50:20.367 --> 50:22.135
You want to see?

50:22.235 --> 50:23.570
I guess.

50:23.670 --> 50:25.238
Just look at the screen.

50:25.338 --> 50:26.406
There.

50:26.506 --> 50:27.975
Everything looks great.

50:28.075 --> 50:29.142
You see that little...
that flickering

50:29.242 --> 50:32.195
right there in the middle of the screen?

50:32.295 --> 50:33.714
Yeah.

50:33.814 --> 50:35.015
Right there.

50:35.115 --> 50:37.150
That's the heartbeat.

50:37.250 --> 50:39.653
- Congratulations, Mrs. Hunterson.
- Glory be. Hallelujah.

50:39.753 --> 50:41.822
Uh, Mrs. Hunterson doesn't really like
to be congratulated.

50:41.922 --> 50:43.690
Oh, sorry.

50:43.790 --> 50:45.792
Huh.

50:45.892 --> 50:48.811
Don't really look like
much at this point.

50:48.911 --> 50:51.665
Certainly don't look
like no baby yet.

50:51.765 --> 50:53.741
Well...

50:53.841 --> 50:56.036
Ah, thank you, Norma.
That's all we need you for.

50:56.136 --> 50:59.038
All done here.

50:59.138 --> 51:00.340
(door opens)

51:00.440 --> 51:02.509
Well, there you have it.

51:02.609 --> 51:04.978
Yeah.

51:05.078 --> 51:07.214
So I guess we are officially
forgetting about that nonsense

51:07.314 --> 51:08.915
that happened last month?

51:09.015 --> 51:10.484
Yes, we officially are.

51:10.584 --> 51:11.852
I want to apologize for it.

51:11.952 --> 51:13.520
I almost called you
just to apologize.

51:13.620 --> 51:15.922
I mean, I was so
stressed out at the time,

51:16.022 --> 51:17.290
taking on all those new patients.

51:17.390 --> 51:18.425
I hadn't been sleeping well.

51:18.525 --> 51:20.961
My judgment was not
what it normally is.

51:21.061 --> 51:23.397
I want you to know
that'll never happen again.

51:23.497 --> 51:24.731
From now on our relationship

51:24.831 --> 51:28.826
will be strictly a medical
and professional one.

51:30.153 --> 51:33.153
(clattering)

51:37.094 --> 51:38.745
Jenna, no.

51:38.845 --> 51:41.795
Not with the door open.

51:42.966 --> 51:44.985
(choir chanting
over classical orchestration)

51:45.085 --> 51:46.586
JENNA:
"Dear baby.

51:46.686 --> 51:50.607
"P.S. I'd want to be able to
teach a baby such as yourself

51:50.707 --> 51:53.527
"the difference between good and bad,
right and wrong."

51:53.627 --> 51:55.228
(knocking at door)

51:55.328 --> 51:57.898
"but it seems I'm not fit
to teach nobody nothing."

51:57.998 --> 52:00.100
NORMA:
Dr. Pomatter, you still in there?

52:00.200 --> 52:01.701
You got a phone call.

52:01.801 --> 52:03.570
I'll be right out, Norma.

52:03.670 --> 52:05.839
Mrs. Hunterson needs to be weighed.
Would you take care of that?

52:05.939 --> 52:11.634
And you can get dressed.
I'll see you in my office in a few minutes.

52:27.511 --> 52:28.795
Don't do that again.

52:28.895 --> 52:30.964
Okay, what? Okay, I won't.

52:31.064 --> 52:32.132
Kiss you, you mean?

52:32.232 --> 52:34.434
No, not that.
I didn't mean that.

52:34.534 --> 52:37.654
I mean don't go away for
a full month and not call.

52:37.754 --> 52:38.738
No questions or concerns.

52:38.838 --> 52:39.940
Don't do that.

52:40.040 --> 52:41.208
This is craziness, Dr. Pomatter.

52:41.308 --> 52:42.776
Please, call me Jim.

52:42.876 --> 52:43.977
No, I won't.

52:44.077 --> 52:45.779
Okay, don't.
Just Dr. Pomatter's fine.

52:45.879 --> 52:47.447
Dr. Pomatter, this is so...

52:47.547 --> 52:49.583
I don't want to have another conversation

52:49.683 --> 52:50.951
about how crazy this is

52:51.051 --> 52:53.453
or how sorry I am,
or how bad

52:53.553 --> 52:55.889
my judgment is, or how I'll
never touch you again.

52:55.989 --> 52:59.176
Not only would I be lying,
but every time I start saying

52:59.276 --> 53:01.264
those things, all that happens
is you attack me.

53:01.364 --> 53:03.324
- You're right.
- Have you been taking your

53:03.424 --> 53:04.664
- prenatal vitamins every day?
- Faithfully.

53:04.764 --> 53:06.233
Any bad morning sickness?

53:06.333 --> 53:07.801
- Not too bad, no.
- No more spotting?

53:07.901 --> 53:09.636
- No more spotting.
- Good, I'm going to want to see

53:09.736 --> 53:11.238
you again on Friday
for another appointment.

53:11.338 --> 53:13.140
Do you have time in the afternoon?

53:13.240 --> 53:14.341
Do you get a lunch break?

53:14.441 --> 53:16.076
Yeah, but I'll have to ask Becky
to drive me.

53:16.176 --> 53:18.645
Ask Becky to drive you.
Noon.

53:18.745 --> 53:21.448
Tell the nurse at the desk on your way out
that you want to be fit in.

53:21.548 --> 53:25.001
I have to go to St. Mary's now
and deliver a baby.

53:25.101 --> 53:27.754
Because that's what I do.

53:27.854 --> 53:28.955
Okay.

53:29.055 --> 53:31.191
Are we on the same page now?

53:31.291 --> 53:33.493
We're on the same page.

53:33.593 --> 53:36.543
Good, then.

53:37.414 --> 53:40.414
(banging desk)

53:48.258 --> 53:51.258
I wish it were Friday.

53:56.700 --> 53:59.085
(funky rock playing)

53:59.185 --> 54:02.135
## (man singing)

54:14.184 --> 54:17.184
## (continues)

54:39.809 --> 54:42.809
##

54:47.517 --> 54:50.517
## (continues)

54:56.493 --> 54:59.493
- (shouting)
- ## (continues)

55:14.944 --> 55:16.932
JENNA:
"Dear baby.

55:17.032 --> 55:19.099
"At first, it was really
just about the sex"

55:19.199 --> 55:22.149
## (continues)

55:43.740 --> 55:46.740
## (ends)

55:51.715 --> 55:54.945
Jenna, the doctor is
ready for you now.

55:55.485 --> 55:57.465
WOMAN:
Hi there.

55:57.565 --> 55:58.605
Oh, Dr. Mueller,

55:58.705 --> 56:01.174
how are you?

56:01.274 --> 56:02.309
I thought you retired.

56:02.409 --> 56:03.677
Semiretired.

56:03.777 --> 56:05.979
I'm just out of retirement
for the day, my dear.

56:06.079 --> 56:08.181
Dr. Pomatter and his wife
had to fly back east

56:08.281 --> 56:10.257
for a funeral this morning.

56:10.357 --> 56:13.119
Oh, he flew back east with his wife?

56:13.219 --> 56:15.355
How you feeling?
You doing okay these days?

56:15.455 --> 56:18.441
I'm fine. Just fine. You know,
knocked up and everything.

56:18.541 --> 56:20.521
Yes, I heard.

56:20.621 --> 56:22.295
How's it working out
with Dr. Pomatter?

56:22.395 --> 56:25.314
Oh, he's a great doctor.

56:25.414 --> 56:27.100
Is he coming back soon?

56:27.200 --> 56:28.501
I don't really know.

56:28.601 --> 56:30.136
I think so.

56:30.236 --> 56:31.838
Today we're going to do
some blood work.

56:31.938 --> 56:33.640
It's standard stuff.

56:33.740 --> 56:35.275
Just to see how the baby's developing.

56:35.375 --> 56:37.359
I don't care.
Do I have to do it?

56:37.459 --> 56:38.945
Yeah, you have to do it.

56:39.045 --> 56:41.181
You may be a little
weak afterwards,

56:41.281 --> 56:42.682
so you should
call your husband

56:42.782 --> 56:44.617
or somebody to come pick you up.

56:44.717 --> 56:46.119
Yeah, I'll call him.

56:46.219 --> 56:48.203
Is that pumpkin pie for me?

56:48.303 --> 56:50.255
Kind of.

56:50.355 --> 56:52.158
If's just something I invented.

56:52.258 --> 56:55.208
(whispers):
"Naughty Pumpkin Pie."

56:58.615 --> 57:01.615
(horn honking)

57:11.227 --> 57:13.012
JENNA:
Hey,

57:13.112 --> 57:14.948
you ever going to tell us
your secret, girl?

57:15.048 --> 57:16.583
Yes, I am, when I'm ready.

57:16.683 --> 57:18.017
DAWN:
I've got a secret, too.

57:18.117 --> 57:19.819
BECKY:
You, Dawn?

57:19.919 --> 57:22.322
Yes. I have a boyfriend now.

57:22.422 --> 57:23.323
- (gasping)
-JENNA: No!

57:23.423 --> 57:24.891
Yes.

57:24.991 --> 57:26.226
Well, who is he?

57:26.326 --> 57:27.494
Tell us everything, honey.

57:27.594 --> 57:29.586
You're never going to believe
it, but, um... you know

57:29.686 --> 57:31.671
that guy came to the diner
that day, wouldn't leave?

57:31.771 --> 57:32.665
Name was Ogie?

57:32.765 --> 57:34.033
Ogie, the stalking elf?

57:34.133 --> 57:35.201
Yeah, I remember that guy.

57:35.301 --> 57:38.104
What about him?

57:38.204 --> 57:39.939
Well, it-it's him.

57:40.039 --> 57:42.989
(gasps)

57:44.160 --> 57:47.080
Well, that is wonderful, Dawn!

57:47.180 --> 57:49.215
Isn't it, Jenna?

57:49.315 --> 57:50.683
Yeah, that's wonderful.

57:50.783 --> 57:52.759
How'd that happen?

57:52.859 --> 57:55.121
Well, you know,
he was true to his word.

57:55.221 --> 57:57.056
He didn't never give up.

57:57.156 --> 57:58.525
His cousin Pete gave him my number.

57:58.625 --> 58:00.794
He called me, like,
30 times in one day.

58:00.894 --> 58:02.262
I thought I might kill him.

58:02.362 --> 58:04.097
But he got to me.

58:04.197 --> 58:05.398
He did?

58:05.498 --> 58:06.533
Yeah.

58:06.633 --> 58:08.168
Well, he's so passionate.

58:08.268 --> 58:09.869
He writes me
these spontaneous poems.

58:09.969 --> 58:12.572
Spontaneous poems.

58:12.672 --> 58:15.590
Yes, they are poems that just
occur to him right on the spot.

58:15.690 --> 58:17.679
Last night he said to me,

58:17.779 --> 58:21.765
"Dawn, your face is a brilliant
moon in my empty room."

58:21.865 --> 58:22.982
Aw...

58:23.082 --> 58:24.951
"Your love is
like a beating drum,

58:25.051 --> 58:26.619
"ba-bum-ba-bum-ba-bum-ba-bum."

58:26.719 --> 58:27.887
Hmm.

58:27.987 --> 58:30.457
And yeah, I know what you're
thinking, that he's not...

58:30.557 --> 58:33.507
so pretty... but

58:34.010 --> 58:36.129
he grows on you.

58:36.229 --> 58:40.309
And anyway, he's it,
'cause nobody else wants me.

58:40.750 --> 58:43.203
Well, honey, you probably
shouldn't be with someone

58:43.303 --> 58:44.804
just 'cause nobody else wants you.

58:44.904 --> 58:46.906
Yeah, well, you are.

58:47.006 --> 58:48.341
And you wouldn't know it

58:48.441 --> 58:51.628
to look at him,
but he is a sexual dynamo.

58:51.728 --> 58:52.812
Wow.

58:52.912 --> 58:54.681
No, you wouldn't know it.

58:54.781 --> 58:56.316
JENNA:
Well, Dawn,

58:56.416 --> 58:58.117
I sure hope it's making you happy.

58:58.217 --> 59:00.620
You don't mean that.

59:00.720 --> 59:01.921
Yes, I do.

59:02.021 --> 59:03.256
Nope.

59:03.356 --> 59:05.525
I know what you're thinking,
'cause you called him an elf.

59:05.625 --> 59:08.812
Only 'cause you initially
called him an elf.

59:08.912 --> 59:10.196
- You're jealous.
- No!

59:10.296 --> 59:11.431
You are.

59:11.531 --> 59:14.067
Because you have the most mean,
controlling husband

59:14.167 --> 59:16.159
in the world,
and you are stuck there!

59:16.259 --> 59:19.038
But I have found someone
who loves me to death!

59:19.138 --> 59:20.306
Well, let's hope not to death.

59:20.406 --> 59:21.474
And I am happy!

59:21.574 --> 59:24.524
Good.

59:25.428 --> 59:28.431
When the fruit pies go in,
would you put this one in with that one?

59:28.531 --> 59:33.121
I'm going to go and clean up now
and set up my station.

59:34.938 --> 59:37.938
We'll see you out there!

59:39.375 --> 59:40.593
Don't say nothing.

59:40.693 --> 59:41.794
I wasn't gonna.

59:41.894 --> 59:43.663
I'm not in no position
to judge nobody.

59:43.763 --> 59:45.131
Neither are you.

59:45.231 --> 59:47.207
I hope I didn't hurt her
feelings too bad.

59:47.307 --> 59:48.401
She'll be fine.

59:48.501 --> 59:51.170
- Hey, is Cal inside yet?
- Yeah, I saw him.

59:51.270 --> 59:53.907
Think it's time for me
to tell him about the baby.

59:54.007 --> 59:55.475
You got the oven under control?

59:55.575 --> 59:56.843
- I do.
- Wish me luck.

59:56.943 --> 59:59.479
Wishing you luck, honey.

59:59.579 --> 01:00:00.413
Well, uh...

01:00:00.513 --> 01:00:01.714
What?

01:00:01.814 --> 01:00:05.214
It seems I'm almost
five months pregnant.

01:00:05.668 --> 01:00:08.588
Yeah, so?

01:00:08.688 --> 01:00:10.390
So I just thought I should tell you.

01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:11.491
I already knew.

01:00:11.591 --> 01:00:12.892
You did?

01:00:12.992 --> 01:00:14.594
Yeah, I thought everybody knew.

01:00:14.694 --> 01:00:16.496
Oh, who told you?

01:00:16.596 --> 01:00:18.698
Nobody told me.
Nobody needs to tell me.

01:00:18.798 --> 01:00:19.899
I mean, look at you.

01:00:19.999 --> 01:00:21.100
What'd you think?

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:23.069
I thought you went and got fat?

01:00:23.169 --> 01:00:25.338
Truth be told,
as long as you can carry a tray

01:00:25.438 --> 01:00:26.573
and fill a pie tin,

01:00:26.673 --> 01:00:30.159
I don't care
if you give birth while doing it.

01:00:30.259 --> 01:00:32.512
Well, I'm relieved.

01:00:32.612 --> 01:00:35.562
I'm not such a bad guy, maybe.

01:00:35.698 --> 01:00:38.117
You're not such a bad guy, maybe.

01:00:38.217 --> 01:00:39.986
Well, get out there
and get to work, Jenna.

01:00:40.086 --> 01:00:41.654
Come on. We ain't got all day.

01:00:41.754 --> 01:00:42.789
I'll get to work.

01:00:42.889 --> 01:00:45.839
(bluesy music plays)

01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:50.210
## (man singing)

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:53.032
How you doing today, Joe?

01:00:53.132 --> 01:00:55.969
Same bastard as yesterday, Jenna.

01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:58.071
How are you?

01:00:58.171 --> 01:00:59.572
Same train wreck.

01:00:59.672 --> 01:01:01.074
And how's the baby doing so far?

01:01:01.174 --> 01:01:04.727
So far so good, no problems,
no birth defects,

01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:06.212
no diseases, whatever.

01:01:06.312 --> 01:01:07.680
Good, good.

01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:09.248
How's the bad husband?

01:01:09.348 --> 01:01:10.883
Just awful.

01:01:10.983 --> 01:01:11.985
And the lipstick smudger?

01:01:12.085 --> 01:01:13.319
The lipstick smudger?

01:01:13.419 --> 01:01:14.687
The dog on the side.

01:01:14.787 --> 01:01:15.922
The affair.

01:01:16.022 --> 01:01:18.015
(whispers):
Shh, Joe, I'm not having no affair.

01:01:18.115 --> 01:01:21.041
Okay, you're not having no affair.

01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:23.763
Want to hear your horoscope
before I give you my order?

01:01:23.863 --> 01:01:24.764
No.

01:01:24.864 --> 01:01:26.866
Too bad, here it is.

01:01:26.966 --> 01:01:29.102
"Aquarius.

01:01:29.202 --> 01:01:32.301
"If, indeed, you're having an affair,

01:01:32.401 --> 01:01:34.474
"it might be a good time to step back,

01:01:34.574 --> 01:01:36.175
"look at your life

01:01:36.275 --> 01:01:37.644
"and reassess things a bit."

01:01:37.744 --> 01:01:39.178
It don't say that in there.

01:01:39.278 --> 01:01:40.446
Yes, it does.

01:01:40.546 --> 01:01:44.434
It says, "Even if you have
a miserable, snake husband,

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:47.020
"you probably shouldn't be
having no affair,

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:48.688
"'cause it's beneath you

01:01:48.788 --> 01:01:51.624
"and could make you seem
like a common hussy.

01:01:51.724 --> 01:01:53.720
"Not to mention the pain

01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:55.561
you could cause other people."

01:01:55.661 --> 01:01:58.431
You're just making that up.

01:01:58.531 --> 01:02:01.651
This afternoon I want the
"Singing Tuna Fish Casserole"

01:02:01.751 --> 01:02:03.369
no pickle on the plate.

01:02:03.469 --> 01:02:04.737
Well-done Frenchie fries

01:02:04.837 --> 01:02:09.342
with melted Swiss cheese
and gravy on their own plate,

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:11.144
and "Jenna's Special Strawberry

01:02:11.244 --> 01:02:13.112
Chocolate Oasis Pie."
You got that?

01:02:13.212 --> 01:02:14.480
I got that.

01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:16.573
Give me a smile, Jenna.

01:02:16.673 --> 01:02:19.218
Nobody makes strawberry
chocolate pie the way you do.

01:02:19.318 --> 01:02:21.421
Wednesday's my favorite day
of the week,

01:02:21.521 --> 01:02:23.356
'cause I get to have a slice of it.

01:02:23.456 --> 01:02:25.658
I think about it as I'm waking up.

01:02:25.758 --> 01:02:28.261
Could solve all the problems
with the world, that pie.

01:02:28.361 --> 01:02:29.629
You're making too much oft.

01:02:29.729 --> 01:02:31.230
If's just a pie.

01:02:31.330 --> 01:02:33.132
Just a pie?

01:02:33.232 --> 01:02:34.133
It's down right expert.

01:02:34.233 --> 01:02:35.835
A thing of beauty.

01:02:35.935 --> 01:02:39.329
How each flavor opens itself,
one by one,

01:02:39.429 --> 01:02:41.808
like a chapter in a book.

01:02:41.908 --> 01:02:44.961
First the flavor
of an exotic spice hits you,

01:02:45.061 --> 01:02:47.058
just a hint of it.

01:02:47.158 --> 01:02:51.501
And then you're flooded with
chocolate, dark and bittersweet,

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:53.986
like an old love affair.

01:02:54.086 --> 01:02:56.988
And finally, strawberry;

01:02:57.088 --> 01:03:00.376
the way strawberry was always
supposed to taste,

01:03:00.476 --> 01:03:01.527
but never knew how.

01:03:01.627 --> 01:03:03.763
In fact,

01:03:03.863 --> 01:03:05.398
I tell you what.

01:03:05.498 --> 01:03:07.700
Forget all the other stuff
I ordered.

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:09.335
Just bring me the damn pie.

01:03:09.435 --> 01:03:10.803
That's all I want.

01:03:10.903 --> 01:03:12.205
I don't care if it's not

01:03:12.305 --> 01:03:13.206
a well-balanced meal.

01:03:13.306 --> 01:03:15.341
Just bring me the pie.

01:03:15.441 --> 01:03:19.228
Old Joe'll maybe not have much
longer to live, you know?

01:03:19.328 --> 01:03:21.581
Then I better bring you the pie
right away.

01:03:21.681 --> 01:03:24.631
Yes'm, you better.

01:03:28.938 --> 01:03:30.490
- CAL: I love you!
- Oh!

01:03:30.590 --> 01:03:32.625
I love your breast.
I love your breast.

01:03:32.725 --> 01:03:34.794
I love this breast! Mmm!
I like this breast, too!

01:03:34.894 --> 01:03:36.929
- Oh!
- (shrieks)

01:03:37.029 --> 01:03:39.022
Uh, there's my order, Cal,

01:03:39.122 --> 01:03:41.082
and I'm going
to need a slice of Oasis.

01:03:41.182 --> 01:03:43.469
Gonna go throw up now.

01:03:43.569 --> 01:03:44.771
Jenna.

01:03:44.871 --> 01:03:46.472
- Whoa!
- No, Cal!

01:03:46.572 --> 01:03:48.040
-Jenna!
- Hey!

01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:51.090
(sighs)

01:03:52.295 --> 01:03:53.613
I didn't plan it, Jenna.

01:03:53.713 --> 01:03:54.881
It just happened.

01:03:54.981 --> 01:03:57.016
He's got such nice, strong hands.

01:03:57.116 --> 01:03:58.785
Your poor husband.

01:03:58.885 --> 01:04:00.486
My poor husband
wears a diaper,

01:04:00.586 --> 01:04:03.122
curses constantly
and sleeps in a separate room.

01:04:03.222 --> 01:04:04.791
So why don't you
just divorce him then?

01:04:04.891 --> 01:04:07.360
I can't just leave
a sick, crazy, old man.

01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:08.861
What kind of person would do that?

01:04:08.961 --> 01:04:11.364
I don't know. What kind of person
has an affair with Cal,

01:04:11.464 --> 01:04:13.533
who's married to Ethel,
who we see all the time?

01:04:13.633 --> 01:04:14.534
He says she's awful.

01:04:14.634 --> 01:04:15.902
Maybe anyone
you stay married to

01:04:16.002 --> 01:04:17.703
for 15 years starts to seem awful.

01:04:17.803 --> 01:04:19.639
But we know Ethel.
She's not awful.

01:04:19.739 --> 01:04:21.723
She tells Cal not to yell at us.

01:04:21.823 --> 01:04:25.128
Hey, you're supposed
to be my friend, not Ethel's.

01:04:25.228 --> 01:04:27.547
Having an affair
is a terrible thing to do.

01:04:27.647 --> 01:04:30.800
It destroys people's lives, and I don't
want you messed up with all that.

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:31.918
(knocking at door)

01:04:32.018 --> 01:04:33.653
DAWN:
Jenna, there's this cute guy here

01:04:33.753 --> 01:04:34.654
to see you.

01:04:34.754 --> 01:04:37.156
He says he's your doctor.

01:04:37.256 --> 01:04:40.206
That's perfect.
Just perfect.

01:04:44.981 --> 01:04:46.265
What are you doing here?

01:04:46.365 --> 01:04:48.349
- You can't just come here.
- I had an hour to kill.

01:04:48.449 --> 01:04:50.002
I wanted to see you.

01:04:50.102 --> 01:04:52.305
Did you make this pie?
It's bliss. Of course you made it.

01:04:52.405 --> 01:04:54.941
I got to get back to work.

01:04:55.041 --> 01:04:56.609
- When can I see you again?
- Dr. Pomatter,

01:04:56.709 --> 01:04:59.644
I've been thinking.

01:04:59.744 --> 01:05:01.347
I think we need to end this.

01:05:01.447 --> 01:05:02.849
- No.
- Yes.

01:05:02.949 --> 01:05:04.050
Why?

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:05.685
Because I feel like
a bad person,

01:05:05.785 --> 01:05:07.587
- and I can't live with that.
-Jenna...

01:05:07.687 --> 01:05:09.055
No, don't say anything.

01:05:09.155 --> 01:05:10.957
Don't get all nervous and sweet.

01:05:11.057 --> 01:05:12.358
Don't talk me out of it.

01:05:12.458 --> 01:05:16.198
Just, please, finish your pie
and go. Please.

01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:21.915
I'm sorry.

01:05:23.085 --> 01:05:26.085
(country music playing low)

01:05:27.657 --> 01:05:30.657
(humming melody)

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:32.211
Last piece.

01:05:32.311 --> 01:05:34.580
Sold out even faster
than usual today.

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:36.115
Good on us.

01:05:36.215 --> 01:05:39.165
Thanks.

01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:42.688
Cal...

01:05:42.788 --> 01:05:44.223
Yeah?

01:05:44.323 --> 01:05:47.273
Are you happy?

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:53.242
I mean, would you call yourself
a happy man?

01:05:53.342 --> 01:05:56.452
Well, if you're asking me
a serious question, I'll tell you.

01:05:56.552 --> 01:05:58.938
I'm happy enough.

01:05:59.038 --> 01:06:03.118
I don't expect much, give much,
I don't get much.

01:06:03.993 --> 01:06:07.053
I generally enjoy whatever comes up.

01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:12.685
That's my truth, summed up
for your feminine judgment.

01:06:12.785 --> 01:06:14.220
I'm happy enough.

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:17.270
Why do you ask?

01:06:18.441 --> 01:06:21.441
No reason.

01:06:22.111 --> 01:06:25.111
(humming)

01:06:41.364 --> 01:06:42.915
OGIE:
Good evening.

01:06:43.015 --> 01:06:45.965
Good evening.

01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:49.455
I'm just waiting on Dawn.

01:06:49.555 --> 01:06:51.390
Hmm.

01:06:51.490 --> 01:06:54.890
Taking her to Stanton
for a steak dinner.

01:06:55.211 --> 01:06:56.929
Gonna be asking her to marry me.

01:06:57.029 --> 01:06:58.331
- Wow.
- Yeah.

01:06:58.431 --> 01:07:01.381
There you are.

01:07:01.617 --> 01:07:04.754
Dawn, if I had a penny for
everything I loved about you,

01:07:04.854 --> 01:07:06.172
I would have many pennies.

01:07:06.272 --> 01:07:09.692
(gasps): He's-He's making me
a poem right here.

01:07:09.792 --> 01:07:11.844
Penny for your teeth,

01:07:11.944 --> 01:07:15.854
penny for your nose,
penny for your eyes, penny

01:07:16.132 --> 01:07:20.042
for your hair, your navel,
penny for your odor.

01:07:20.302 --> 01:07:23.302
A dollar for your heart.

01:07:23.906 --> 01:07:26.692
Aw, Ogie, thank you.

01:07:26.792 --> 01:07:29.742
That sure is sweet.

01:07:35.251 --> 01:07:37.336
You two have a good time, you hear?

01:07:37.436 --> 01:07:39.705
Oh, we will.

01:07:39.805 --> 01:07:40.940
Bye.

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:43.990
Where we going?

01:07:49.799 --> 01:07:51.050
Waiting for Earl?

01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:53.452
Yeah.

01:07:53.552 --> 01:07:56.672
Hey, I'm real sorry
for what I said before.

01:07:56.772 --> 01:08:00.217
Listen, I love you no matter what you do.

01:08:00.317 --> 01:08:02.256
Okay.

01:08:02.356 --> 01:08:03.195
Okay.

01:08:03.295 --> 01:08:04.196
I forgive you.

01:08:04.296 --> 01:08:05.197
Good.

01:08:05.297 --> 01:08:07.273
Good.

01:08:07.373 --> 01:08:09.969
'Cause this is my little adventure.

01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:11.103
Your little adventure?

01:08:11.203 --> 01:08:12.104
Yeah.

01:08:12.204 --> 01:08:13.639
I'm having me a little adventure

01:08:13.739 --> 01:08:15.474
after many years of lots of nothing.

01:08:15.574 --> 01:08:17.042
You love him?

01:08:17.143 --> 01:08:19.612
Cal?

01:08:19.712 --> 01:08:21.947
I don't know.

01:08:22.046 --> 01:08:23.649
But I love it.

01:08:23.749 --> 01:08:27.036
I love having someone
to look pretty for.

01:08:27.136 --> 01:08:31.006
I love waking up and having
something to look forward to.

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:34.107
Something fun and sneaky and sexy.

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:36.362
He love you?

01:08:36.462 --> 01:08:37.529
He kind of likes me.

01:08:37.630 --> 01:08:39.765
He kind of hates me.

01:08:39.865 --> 01:08:41.200
It's fun.

01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:43.368
It doesn't sound very fun.

01:08:43.469 --> 01:08:44.403
He makes me forget

01:08:44.502 --> 01:08:47.456
about my invalid husband,
my loneliness,

01:08:47.555 --> 01:08:50.786
the dreadful misplacement
of my bosoms.

01:08:51.327 --> 01:08:54.727
Becky, I don't know how
to tell you this,

01:08:55.029 --> 01:08:57.249
but your bosoms are fine.

01:08:57.349 --> 01:08:58.850
There ain't nothing wrong with them.

01:08:58.951 --> 01:08:59.952
It's all in your head.

01:09:00.051 --> 01:09:01.620
What are you talking about?
Are you blind?

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:03.154
This one's way up here in Maine,

01:09:03.255 --> 01:09:04.756
this one's dangling
down here in Florida.

01:09:04.857 --> 01:09:07.807
(horn honking)

01:09:08.743 --> 01:09:10.741
All right, well,
I'll see you tomorrow, honey.

01:09:10.841 --> 01:09:13.265
No, you won't.
Tomorrow's Thursday, my day off.

01:09:13.365 --> 01:09:14.332
Then I'll see you Friday?

01:09:14.433 --> 01:09:16.469
Yeah.

01:09:16.569 --> 01:09:19.519
(both chuckle)

01:09:19.755 --> 01:09:20.706
All right, bye.

01:09:20.805 --> 01:09:23.756
Bye.

01:09:30.866 --> 01:09:33.866
Hey, Porky.

01:09:35.571 --> 01:09:37.689
Hey.

01:09:37.790 --> 01:09:40.292
Why don't you treat me like a man?

01:09:40.392 --> 01:09:43.341
I don't feel like it.

01:09:44.546 --> 01:09:47.546
"I don't feel like it."

01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:52.203
Well, what makes you think
you have that option, hmm?

01:09:53.322 --> 01:09:54.807
Earl.

01:09:54.907 --> 01:09:55.908
Stop.

01:09:56.008 --> 01:09:58.958
Come on.
Don't tell me to stop.

01:09:59.094 --> 01:10:00.346
Hmm, come on.

01:10:00.446 --> 01:10:02.982
I feed you.

01:10:03.082 --> 01:10:06.032
I pay for this house.

01:10:06.302 --> 01:10:09.287
I put clothes on your back.

01:10:09.387 --> 01:10:11.380
Come on, Just do what I tell you.

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:13.225
I won't get too mad.

01:10:13.325 --> 01:10:16.275
Earl, that hurts, come on.

01:10:21.951 --> 01:10:24.036
I love you, baby.

01:10:24.136 --> 01:10:27.086
I don't care if you're fat.

01:10:29.191 --> 01:10:32.191
You're my sweet thing.

01:10:46.572 --> 01:10:49.572
(dog barks in distance)

01:10:57.049 --> 01:11:00.049
(engine turns)

01:11:08.493 --> 01:11:10.913
(dreamy lullaby plays)

01:11:11.013 --> 01:11:15.324
JENNA: "Pregnant. Miserable,
Self-Pitying Loser Pie"

01:11:15.424 --> 01:11:18.630
Lumpy oatmeal with
fruitcake mashed in,

01:11:19.905 --> 01:11:22.905
flambe, of course'

01:11:23.008 --> 01:11:26.008
(doorbell ringing)

01:11:31.216 --> 01:11:33.233
What are you doing here?

01:11:33.333 --> 01:11:35.671
I took the whole day off.

01:11:35.771 --> 01:11:37.406
I don't know.

01:11:37.506 --> 01:11:38.907
I wanted to see you.

01:11:39.007 --> 01:11:40.275
You look awful.

01:11:40.375 --> 01:11:41.877
Thanks.

01:11:41.977 --> 01:11:44.813
I mean, you look sad.

01:11:44.913 --> 01:11:47.863
You look really sad.

01:11:48.467 --> 01:11:50.455
It's taken you a long time
to notice this,

01:11:50.555 --> 01:11:54.446
but, uh... I'm not a happy woman,
Dr. Pomatter.

01:11:54.546 --> 01:11:57.226
And I don't want you to save me.

01:11:57.326 --> 01:11:58.560
I don't want to save you.

01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:01.610
Don't want to be saved.

01:12:03.915 --> 01:12:06.368
Can I come in?

01:12:06.468 --> 01:12:09.418
No.

01:12:11.490 --> 01:12:14.490
Yeah.

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:23.418
So, what now?

01:12:23.518 --> 01:12:24.987
I don't know.

01:12:25.087 --> 01:12:28.340
I thought maybe you could
teach me how to make a pie.

01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:31.425
Seriously?

01:12:31.525 --> 01:12:32.794
Seriously.

01:12:32.894 --> 01:12:35.844
I could do that, sure.

01:12:37.215 --> 01:12:40.215
Come here.

01:12:46.625 --> 01:12:49.625
(gentle pop music plays)

01:12:50.429 --> 01:12:53.429
## (man singing)

01:12:54.533 --> 01:12:55.884
"Dear baby.

01:12:55.984 --> 01:12:58.420
"I hope someday, somebody
wants to hold you

01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:01.873
"for 20 minutes straight.
and that's all they do.

01:13:01.973 --> 01:13:03.525
"They don't pull away.

01:13:03.625 --> 01:13:05.327
"They don't look at your face.

01:13:05.427 --> 01:13:07.295
"They don't try to kiss you.

01:13:07.395 --> 01:13:09.965
"All they do is wrap you up
in their arms

01:13:10.065 --> 01:13:13.752
"and hold on tight without
an ounce of selfishness to it."

01:13:13.852 --> 01:13:16.852
## (continues)

01:13:21.793 --> 01:13:24.793
(laughing):
I got it.

01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:45.380
- And now the berries.
- Berries.

01:13:53.325 --> 01:13:56.325
Okay, I'm finished.

01:14:05.837 --> 01:14:08.837
I can't let the chocolate burn.

01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:11.940
I love watching you.

01:14:12.811 --> 01:14:15.430
Once the chocolate's all in,
you'll pour the berries on top.

01:14:15.530 --> 01:14:18.033
JIM: I'll pour the berries on top.

01:14:18.133 --> 01:14:22.128
Mama used to call this
"The Lonely Chicago Pie."

01:14:22.454 --> 01:14:24.806
She made hundreds of
different kinds of pie.

01:14:24.906 --> 01:14:29.161
They all have real strange names,
like "Car Radio Pie"

01:14:29.261 --> 01:14:32.261
or "Jenna's First Kiss Pie."

01:14:39.838 --> 01:14:42.790
Now the berries-you do it.

01:14:42.890 --> 01:14:45.841
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

01:14:47.879 --> 01:14:50.565
You know, Mama would keep me in
the kitchen with her,

01:14:50.665 --> 01:14:53.567
and teach me everything
she knew about baking.

01:14:53.667 --> 01:14:56.618
She'd sing to me so sweetly.

01:14:57.622 --> 01:15:01.022
# Baby, don't you cry,
gonna make a pie #

01:15:01.893 --> 01:15:05.803
# Gonna make a pie
with a heart in the middle #

01:15:06.631 --> 01:15:10.201
# Baby, don't be blue,
gonna make for you #

01:15:10.502 --> 01:15:14.412
# Gonna make a pie with
a heart in the middle #

01:15:14.706 --> 01:15:17.706
# Gonna be a pie
from heaven above #

01:15:18.009 --> 01:15:21.324
# Gonna be filled
with strawberry love #

01:15:22.647 --> 01:15:26.047
# Baby, don't you cry,
gonna make a pie #

01:15:26.818 --> 01:15:30.728
# Hold you forever in
the middle of my heart. #

01:15:31.723 --> 01:15:33.108
You are so beautiful.

01:15:33.208 --> 01:15:34.242
No, I'm not.

01:15:34.342 --> 01:15:35.443
You are.

01:15:35.543 --> 01:15:37.612
I'm fat.

01:15:37.712 --> 01:15:38.747
You're pregnant.

01:15:38.847 --> 01:15:40.840
You've got a little baby
growing inside you.

01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:42.651
There is nothing more beautiful.

01:15:42.751 --> 01:15:45.701
It's an alien and a parasite.

01:15:46.104 --> 01:15:48.290
It makes me tired and weak.

01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:50.125
It complicates my whole life.

01:15:50.225 --> 01:15:51.793
I resent it.

01:15:51.893 --> 01:15:54.763
I have no idea
how to take care oft.

01:15:54.863 --> 01:15:57.199
I'm the anti-mother.

01:15:57.299 --> 01:16:00.068
I don't want to talk
about that no more.

01:16:00.168 --> 01:16:03.321
I want to know
what the hell you're doing here.

01:16:03.421 --> 01:16:05.307
I'm learning how to make
"Lonely Chicago Pie."

01:16:05.407 --> 01:16:09.997
No, I mean what you're doing here,
living in this town.

01:16:10.528 --> 01:16:12.280
My wife.

01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:15.150
She just finished med school and
we came here for her residency.

01:16:15.250 --> 01:16:17.552
Are you happy with her?

01:16:17.652 --> 01:16:20.602
No, don't answer that.

01:16:21.206 --> 01:16:23.225
I'm happy right now.

01:16:23.325 --> 01:16:25.026
Being here with you.

01:16:25.126 --> 01:16:27.696
That's a good answer.

01:16:27.796 --> 01:16:30.746
You make me feel calm.

01:16:30.882 --> 01:16:33.768
You make me feel peaceful.

01:16:33.868 --> 01:16:35.370
I don't feel that much.

01:16:35.470 --> 01:16:37.806
I tend to be neurotic.

01:16:37.906 --> 01:16:40.609
And you're so beautiful.

01:16:40.709 --> 01:16:42.344
Keep going.

01:16:42.444 --> 01:16:43.678
And so sexy.

01:16:43.778 --> 01:16:44.880
More, please.

01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:47.048
And I could find
the whole meaning of life

01:16:47.148 --> 01:16:50.098
in those sad eyes.

01:16:50.802 --> 01:16:53.802
Wow.

01:17:05.483 --> 01:17:07.002
"Dear baby.

01:17:07.102 --> 01:17:10.755
"Somewhere in the space
between the pie baking

01:17:10.855 --> 01:17:13.742
"and Earl eating it
later that night.

01:17:13.842 --> 01:17:17.262
"began the most intimate
conversation of my life.

01:17:17.362 --> 01:17:20.365
"About my mama,
about how much she loved me,

01:17:20.465 --> 01:17:23.835
"how sad she'd be to see my life
turned out like this.

01:17:23.935 --> 01:17:27.405
"About Earl and how he changed
after we married,

01:17:27.505 --> 01:17:30.058
"became someone I feared.

01:17:30.158 --> 01:17:34.713
"About how lonely it is to be
a woman so poor and so afraid.

01:17:34.813 --> 01:17:37.599
"And then I was addicted, baby.

01:17:37.699 --> 01:17:39.675
"I was addicted
to saying things

01:17:39.775 --> 01:17:42.810
"and having them matter to someone."

01:17:49.294 --> 01:17:51.012
Mm.

01:17:51.112 --> 01:17:55.267
I've never had a real best friend before,
except for my mama.

01:17:55.367 --> 01:17:58.367
You feel like a best friend.

01:17:59.204 --> 01:18:00.755
I have something for you.

01:18:00.855 --> 01:18:02.257
A present.

01:18:02.357 --> 01:18:04.092
A present for me?

01:18:04.192 --> 01:18:05.126
Yes, for you.

01:18:05.226 --> 01:18:07.395
I hope this is not
some damn baby thing.

01:18:07.495 --> 01:18:10.445
No. This is for you.

01:18:13.351 --> 01:18:14.669
- (phone ringing)
- Mm-hmm...

01:18:14.769 --> 01:18:16.404
Excuse me.

01:18:16.504 --> 01:18:17.906
Hello.

01:18:18.006 --> 01:18:19.808
Okay.

01:18:19.908 --> 01:18:22.310
Okay.

01:18:22.410 --> 01:18:24.279
Yes. No, Mrs. Hesdra,

01:18:24.379 --> 01:18:26.372
I think that'll be fine.
No, just keep taking

01:18:26.472 --> 01:18:29.117
the painkillers I gave you
a-and stay on the antibiotics.

01:18:29.217 --> 01:18:31.086
Oh, my God.

01:18:31.186 --> 01:18:32.587
No, no, that's fine.

01:18:32.687 --> 01:18:34.255
No, Just...

01:18:34.355 --> 01:18:35.757
Right. If you have
any more problems,

01:18:35.857 --> 01:18:37.025
just call me in two days.

01:18:37.125 --> 01:18:38.526
Okay. You're welcome.

01:18:38.626 --> 01:18:39.794
Take care.

01:18:39.894 --> 01:18:41.463
(hangs up)

01:18:41.563 --> 01:18:44.513
Do you like it?

01:18:45.417 --> 01:18:48.653
It's the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

01:18:48.753 --> 01:18:50.638
I had it made for you.

01:18:50.738 --> 01:18:52.307
It must have cost a fortune.

01:18:52.407 --> 01:18:53.441
No, not really.

01:18:53.541 --> 01:18:54.809
You shouldn't have done this.

01:18:54.909 --> 01:18:57.828
I can't buy you nothing back.

01:18:57.928 --> 01:19:00.515
I don't want you to buy me anything.

01:19:00.615 --> 01:19:03.930
Why'd you give this
to me, Dr. Pomatter?

01:19:04.536 --> 01:19:06.121
You know why.

01:19:06.221 --> 01:19:09.171
No, I don't.

01:19:09.841 --> 01:19:11.126
Because I am falling

01:19:11.226 --> 01:19:14.176
head over heels...

01:19:22.253 --> 01:19:26.163
(fiddle and banjo playing
wedding processional)

01:19:42.507 --> 01:19:45.507
(sobbing)

01:19:48.313 --> 01:19:49.831
MINISTER:
We're gathered here today

01:19:49.931 --> 01:19:52.434
to celebrate the love
between Ogie Anhorn

01:19:52.534 --> 01:19:55.270
and Dawn Williams...
to join them together

01:19:55.370 --> 01:19:57.572
in holy matrimony for
the rest of their natural lives.

01:19:57.672 --> 01:20:00.175
Can I say something?

01:20:00.275 --> 01:20:03.225
Sure.

01:20:03.928 --> 01:20:07.073
Spontaneous wedding poetry,
right now.

01:20:09.033 --> 01:20:11.219
The title is "Yes."

01:20:11.319 --> 01:20:14.974
Dawn, every time I look
at you, I think yes,

01:20:16.274 --> 01:20:19.226
yes, we're driven by true love.

01:20:19.326 --> 01:20:21.629
Yes, I'm more than just he who audits.

01:20:21.729 --> 01:20:26.064
Yes, I'm poetry and I'm sex,
and I'm living a dream.

01:20:28.386 --> 01:20:30.405
I am, from now on,

01:20:30.505 --> 01:20:33.208
whoever you need me to be.

01:20:33.308 --> 01:20:36.258
Yes, yes, yes.

01:20:40.265 --> 01:20:42.917
Oh, Ogie.

01:20:43.017 --> 01:20:44.886
(applause and cheering)

01:20:44.986 --> 01:20:47.936
(up-tempo country music playing)

01:20:51.109 --> 01:20:54.109
## (man singing)

01:21:04.689 --> 01:21:07.689
## (continues)

01:21:11.496 --> 01:21:13.848
This reminds me of my third wedding.

01:21:13.948 --> 01:21:15.016
Terry Lynn Lemon.

01:21:15.116 --> 01:21:16.618
She had big ones.

01:21:16.718 --> 01:21:19.804
Joe, that's not a very
respectful thing to say.

01:21:19.904 --> 01:21:22.123
I'm just pointing out
her good qualities.

01:21:22.223 --> 01:21:23.458
She was nasty.

01:21:23.558 --> 01:21:24.926
I'm going to invent

01:21:25.026 --> 01:21:29.701
a special pie for you called
"Old Joe's Horny Past Pie."

01:21:29.914 --> 01:21:32.433
Have to wait a bit, I'm afraid.

01:21:32.533 --> 01:21:34.402
- I'm going in the hospital next week.
- Oh.

01:21:34.502 --> 01:21:35.637
Liver stuff.

01:21:35.737 --> 01:21:37.872
Got to have a piece of it removed.

01:21:37.972 --> 01:21:39.541
Maybe I'll even die.

01:21:39.641 --> 01:21:41.943
Don't be stupid.
You won't die.

01:21:42.043 --> 01:21:44.993
(pop ballad playing)

01:21:51.069 --> 01:21:54.021
If I'd ever met a girl
like you, Jenna,

01:21:54.121 --> 01:21:57.436
my whole life could
have been different.

01:21:59.811 --> 01:22:03.314
You don't even know
what you are deep inside.

01:22:03.414 --> 01:22:06.463
You're not just
some little waitress.

01:22:06.563 --> 01:22:09.304
You understand what I'm saying?

01:22:09.404 --> 01:22:11.506
Not at all, no.

01:22:11.606 --> 01:22:14.836
I'm saying, my whole life
I spent lost.

01:22:16.961 --> 01:22:19.681
If a sign said "go this way",
I'd go the other way.

01:22:19.781 --> 01:22:22.731
Time after time after time.

01:22:23.134 --> 01:22:25.987
I turned the wrong corner,
made the wrong choice,

01:22:26.087 --> 01:22:30.252
went the wrong way,
like a chicken without a head.

01:22:30.775 --> 01:22:32.193
You understand?

01:22:32.293 --> 01:22:34.762
You was a chicken without a head?

01:22:34.862 --> 01:22:37.812
Pie lady, listen to me.

01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:40.702
This life will kill you.

01:22:40.802 --> 01:22:42.870
I'm saying...

01:22:42.970 --> 01:22:44.973
make the right choice.

01:22:45.073 --> 01:22:46.608
Start fresh.

01:22:46.708 --> 01:22:48.176
It's never too late.

01:22:48.276 --> 01:22:51.194
Start fresh.

01:22:51.294 --> 01:22:53.381
I ain't got no money, Joe.

01:22:53.481 --> 01:22:56.431
Who the hell does anymore?

01:22:56.601 --> 01:22:59.601
And I'm about to have me a baby.

01:23:00.004 --> 01:23:02.973
I know you are, Jenna.

01:23:03.073 --> 01:23:05.660
I know you are.

01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:08.820
I was just dreaming
a little for you,

01:23:09.113 --> 01:23:12.113
'cause... all my dreams is gone.

01:23:14.519 --> 01:23:16.537
(horn honking continuously)

01:23:16.637 --> 01:23:19.587
Oh, no.

01:23:35.907 --> 01:23:37.392
(clattering)

01:23:37.492 --> 01:23:38.793
(gasping and murmuring)

01:23:38.893 --> 01:23:40.886
(music stops)

01:23:40.986 --> 01:23:42.946
Jenna...

01:23:43.046 --> 01:23:45.914
I'm very upset with you.

01:23:46.718 --> 01:23:49.137
I'll be waiting in the car.

01:23:49.237 --> 01:23:52.757
You have 30 seconds to get
your ass in gear and join me.

01:23:52.857 --> 01:23:55.857
30 seconds!

01:23:57.495 --> 01:24:00.495
(door slams)

01:24:01.332 --> 01:24:03.785
You wasn't exaggerating.

01:24:03.885 --> 01:24:05.386
Your husband is terrible.

01:24:05.486 --> 01:24:07.462
DAWN:
Jenna...

01:24:07.562 --> 01:24:09.724
- Honey, congratulations.
- Okay, Jenna.

01:24:09.824 --> 01:24:12.774
I'll talk to you later, okay?

01:24:19.717 --> 01:24:20.702
Earl...

01:24:20.802 --> 01:24:22.778
No, you don't say nothing.

01:24:22.878 --> 01:24:24.846
You don't say one word.

01:24:24.946 --> 01:24:27.889
Not one word.

01:24:29.293 --> 01:24:32.180
You just sit there.

01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:34.816
Earl, that hurts.

01:24:34.916 --> 01:24:36.718
Open the cabinet

01:24:36.818 --> 01:24:38.820
where the coffee
and the sugar jars are.

01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:40.021
I don't want...

01:24:40.121 --> 01:24:43.071
Just open it!

01:24:44.575 --> 01:24:46.894
What is that?

01:24:46.994 --> 01:24:49.030
Jenna, what is that?

01:24:49.130 --> 01:24:50.331
Money.

01:24:50.431 --> 01:24:52.066
It's all over the fucking house!

01:24:52.166 --> 01:24:54.001
In cabinets, in drawers,

01:24:54.101 --> 01:24:56.270
under chairs, in closets!

01:24:56.370 --> 01:24:59.320
Money hidden all over my house!

01:24:59.724 --> 01:25:00.742
(whispers):
I'm sorry...

01:25:00.842 --> 01:25:02.826
Yeah, after everything
I've done for you...

01:25:02.926 --> 01:25:05.580
you go and hide money from me?

01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:06.848
I'm sorry.

01:25:06.948 --> 01:25:09.898
(sobbing)

01:25:24.715 --> 01:25:28.200
You're the only thing
I ever loved, Jenna.

01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:33.391
And you're the only person
to ever belong to me.

01:25:33.491 --> 01:25:36.491
And you having a secret from me,

01:25:36.928 --> 01:25:39.928
it tears me up.

01:25:40.598 --> 01:25:44.253
Why was you hiding money
all over the house?

01:25:45.736 --> 01:25:48.736
I don't know.

01:25:50.007 --> 01:25:53.077
Tell me you was going
to buy me a present.

01:25:53.177 --> 01:25:55.956
I was going to buy you a present.

01:25:56.056 --> 01:25:59.600
Tell me you was going
to su... surprise me.

01:25:59.784 --> 01:26:02.784
I was going to surprise you.

01:26:04.088 --> 01:26:07.088
Just hold me.

01:26:08.893 --> 01:26:11.893
(sobbing)

01:26:19.070 --> 01:26:20.621
(sniffles)

01:26:20.721 --> 01:26:23.671
Truth is, Earl...

01:26:24.775 --> 01:26:27.835
Truth is, I was saving that money...

01:26:30.648 --> 01:26:32.767
for the baby.

01:26:32.867 --> 01:26:35.636
I was going to buy
some nice things-

01:26:35.736 --> 01:26:37.438
a crib,

01:26:37.538 --> 01:26:40.768
toys, layette-
it was all for the baby.

01:26:43.494 --> 01:26:45.913
It was for the baby?

01:26:46.013 --> 01:26:48.963
Yeah, so I could buy a crib.

01:26:50.535 --> 01:26:53.535
Yeah.

01:26:55.606 --> 01:26:59.261
Baby, I want us to...
I want us to be happy.

01:27:02.713 --> 01:27:05.713
I want us to be happy, Jenna.

01:27:10.087 --> 01:27:13.087
(sniffling)

01:27:14.559 --> 01:27:16.547
"Dear damn baby.

01:27:16.647 --> 01:27:18.412
"If'n you ever want
to know the story

01:27:18.512 --> 01:27:20.982
"of how we bought your damn crib,
I will tell you.

01:27:21.082 --> 01:27:23.351
"Your crib was bought
with the money

01:27:23.451 --> 01:27:25.720
"that was supposed
to buy me a new life.

01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:28.256
"Every time I lay you down
in that damn crib,

01:27:28.356 --> 01:27:29.357
"I'm going to think,

01:27:29.457 --> 01:27:32.193
"'Damn baby, damn crib'

01:27:32.293 --> 01:27:35.346
"Me stuck like a pin
in this damn life"

01:27:35.446 --> 01:27:37.298
(car door closing)

01:27:37.398 --> 01:27:39.100
Hey, guess what, sugar?

01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:41.802
We got enough money left,
I can buy me a nice video camera.

01:27:41.902 --> 01:27:44.272
Film you being pregnant,
the birth, film the baby.

01:27:44.372 --> 01:27:46.407
Maybe when you get
a figure back we can make

01:27:46.507 --> 01:27:49.627
a few nasty tapes,
if you know what I mean.

01:27:49.727 --> 01:27:52.727
Sounds wonderful, Earl.

01:28:04.075 --> 01:28:07.075
Sit up for me, Jenna.

01:28:16.253 --> 01:28:19.253
(Velcro cuff tearing)

01:28:25.930 --> 01:28:30.350
I wish I could stop everything
and run away with you.

01:28:31.235 --> 01:28:33.921
Me, too.

01:28:34.021 --> 01:28:36.524
Where could we go?

01:28:36.624 --> 01:28:38.617
I would go in a second.
I would drop everything.

01:28:38.717 --> 01:28:41.643
Make it go away.

01:28:43.414 --> 01:28:44.899
What?

01:28:44.999 --> 01:28:47.949
Everything else in my life.

01:28:56.927 --> 01:28:59.927
That's a normal reading.

01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:04.986
Jenna, get dressed.

01:29:05.086 --> 01:29:06.787
Meet me outside.

01:29:06.887 --> 01:29:09.056
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

01:29:09.156 --> 01:29:11.759
We're going someplace.

01:29:11.859 --> 01:29:14.809
We might even run away.

01:29:14.945 --> 01:29:17.945
We'll figure it out.

01:29:18.783 --> 01:29:21.783
I mean it.

01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:24.005
(boy laughing)

01:29:24.105 --> 01:29:25.740
(classical music)

01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:27.942
WOMAN:
Don't you spray me! Don't you dare spray me!

01:29:28.042 --> 01:29:30.035
Hunter, no!

01:29:30.135 --> 01:29:31.812
No! No!

01:29:31.912 --> 01:29:33.280
What did I say?

01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:36.330
- (boy laughing)
- Hunter, no!

01:29:37.601 --> 01:29:39.620
Nobody ever tells you beforehand

01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:42.950
how ridiculously hard
it's going to be.

01:29:44.308 --> 01:29:47.308
- Come on, Hunter.
- (laughing)

01:30:08.999 --> 01:30:12.654
Dr. Pomatter, I believe
my water just broke.

01:30:14.672 --> 01:30:17.672
(inhales deeply, then exhales)

01:30:26.083 --> 01:30:28.402
Hey, sweetheart.

01:30:28.502 --> 01:30:32.072
Oh, Dr. Pomatter,
this is my husband, Earl.

01:30:32.356 --> 01:30:34.008
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

01:30:34.108 --> 01:30:35.676
Nice to meet you, Doc.

01:30:35.776 --> 01:30:38.446
Excuse me, but could you
get up from that chair

01:30:38.546 --> 01:30:42.031
- so I could sit next to my wife?
- Right.

01:30:46.737 --> 01:30:48.767
I would have brought you

01:30:48.867 --> 01:30:51.559
some candy or flowers,
but I didn't have no time.

01:30:51.659 --> 01:30:52.827
That's okay, Earl.

01:30:52.927 --> 01:30:55.563
I need you to rest now, Jenna.
Big moment coming soon.

01:30:55.663 --> 01:30:57.898
I'll leave you folks
to your privacy. Excuse me.

01:30:57.998 --> 01:31:00.525
- Dr. Pomatter...
- Yes, Jenna.

01:31:00.625 --> 01:31:02.636
I just want to make sure we're
clear about one thing.

01:31:02.736 --> 01:31:05.005
- What's that, Jenna?
- I want drugs.

01:31:05.105 --> 01:31:07.108
I want massive amounts of drugs.

01:31:07.208 --> 01:31:09.410
I want the maximum
legal limit of drugs.

01:31:09.510 --> 01:31:12.179
Noted and understood.

01:31:12.279 --> 01:31:14.115
Oh, do... do you belong here?

01:31:14.215 --> 01:31:15.249
Yeah, I'm kin.

01:31:15.349 --> 01:31:18.299
Joe, hi!

01:31:18.502 --> 01:31:20.554
You having your surgery today?

01:31:20.654 --> 01:31:22.423
Later this afternoon.

01:31:22.523 --> 01:31:24.507
Cal told me you were here.

01:31:24.607 --> 01:31:26.360
Here, I bought you this card.

01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:28.596
It's silly.
Look at it later, after all

01:31:28.696 --> 01:31:29.597
the fuss is over.

01:31:29.697 --> 01:31:30.965
- Thanks.
- Put it right next

01:31:31.065 --> 01:31:32.933
- to you on the nightstand.
- I will.

01:31:33.033 --> 01:31:34.635
I remember you.

01:31:34.735 --> 01:31:36.437
You're the husband.

01:31:36.537 --> 01:31:38.038
Yeah, I'm the husband.

01:31:38.138 --> 01:31:40.708
Lucky for you, I didn't take
money out of Jenna's check

01:31:40.808 --> 01:31:43.444
for all the damage you did
in my diner at that wedding.

01:31:43.544 --> 01:31:46.080
Don't say nothing smart-ass.

01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:47.782
I'm leaving.

01:31:47.882 --> 01:31:49.283
Give me a hug first.

01:31:49.383 --> 01:31:52.333
Absolutely not.

01:31:53.070 --> 01:31:55.058
(breathing heavy)

01:31:55.158 --> 01:31:57.158
(groans)

01:31:57.258 --> 01:31:58.592
Earl, if you don't

01:31:58.692 --> 01:32:01.912
put that stinking camera away,
I'm going to smash it.

01:32:02.012 --> 01:32:03.764
(chuckles)

01:32:03.864 --> 01:32:04.899
Earl!

01:32:04.999 --> 01:32:06.801
All right, all right.
(laughing)

01:32:06.901 --> 01:32:09.851
(breathing heavily)

01:32:12.957 --> 01:32:15.957
You're doing great, sweetheart.

01:32:17.061 --> 01:32:18.479
You're doing great.

01:32:18.579 --> 01:32:19.780
What am I doing?

01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:22.316
Try and steady your breathing, hon.

01:32:22.416 --> 01:32:24.409
Hi. I'm Francine Pomatter.

01:32:24.509 --> 01:32:26.020
Jim's told me so much about you.

01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:29.350
He thinks you're just
a terrific woman.

01:32:30.007 --> 01:32:31.292
So you must be.

01:32:31.392 --> 01:32:32.760
Did I mention my wife
is a resident here?

01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:35.529
I think you might have
mentioned that.

01:32:35.629 --> 01:32:38.930
He's so proud of me.
He tells everybody.

01:32:39.030 --> 01:32:41.769
She going to be here
through the whole delivery?

01:32:41.869 --> 01:32:44.855
I mean, are all the residents
going to be here?

01:32:44.955 --> 01:32:46.173
No, no, they were just here

01:32:46.273 --> 01:32:47.842
to witness the administration of the epidural.

01:32:47.942 --> 01:32:49.276
So I'm clearing the room now.

01:32:49.376 --> 01:32:52.326
So everybody out.

01:32:54.665 --> 01:32:58.235
She's fully dilated, Doctor.
I think it's time for her to push.

01:32:58.335 --> 01:32:59.987
Let's go.

01:33:00.087 --> 01:33:03.005
NURSE:
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10...

01:33:03.105 --> 01:33:05.492
(Jenna screaming)

01:33:05.592 --> 01:33:08.542
One, two, three, four,
five, six,

01:33:09.079 --> 01:33:11.599
seven, eight, nine, 10...

01:33:11.699 --> 01:33:14.001
JIM: That was a good one, Jenna.
That was a good one.

01:33:14.101 --> 01:33:16.337
- One, two, three, four, five...
- We're getting close.

01:33:16.437 --> 01:33:18.105
- Good, good.
-...six, seven, eight, nine...

01:33:18.205 --> 01:33:20.941
Good, we're almost there.

01:33:21.041 --> 01:33:23.960
- We're almost there, sugar.
- One, two, three, four, five...

01:33:24.060 --> 01:33:27.028
...six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

01:33:27.231 --> 01:33:30.231
I don't want no baby, Earl!

01:33:33.070 --> 01:33:34.655
(baby crying)

01:33:34.755 --> 01:33:37.705
JIM:
Oh, it's a girl.

01:33:41.612 --> 01:33:43.697
EARL:
How do you like that?

01:33:43.797 --> 01:33:47.622
Would you like to cut the cord,
Mr. Hunterson?

01:33:48.018 --> 01:33:50.371
Yeah. Why not?

01:33:50.471 --> 01:33:53.421
(baby crying)

01:33:53.891 --> 01:33:56.891
(applause)

01:34:00.998 --> 01:34:05.002
NURSE:
Would you like to hold your baby, Mrs. Hunterson?

01:34:05.102 --> 01:34:08.102
Mrs. Hunterson.
Did you hear me?

01:34:10.674 --> 01:34:12.860
Are you okay?

01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:15.262
Mrs. Hunterson?

01:34:15.362 --> 01:34:18.312
(crying continues)

01:34:20.117 --> 01:34:23.117
Give her to me.

01:34:25.956 --> 01:34:28.956
(baby stops crying)

01:34:35.733 --> 01:34:38.733
Oh, my God.

01:34:44.808 --> 01:34:47.808
Oh, my God.

01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:59.620
(soft ballad playing)

01:35:03.861 --> 01:35:06.861

01:35:17.408 --> 01:35:20.408
(laughs)

01:35:25.215 --> 01:35:26.734
Hey.

01:35:26.834 --> 01:35:28.102
Do you remember what I said?

01:35:28.202 --> 01:35:31.038
Don't you go loving
that baby too much.

01:35:31.138 --> 01:35:33.207
I don't love you, Earl.

01:35:33.307 --> 01:35:34.742
I haven't loved you for years.

01:35:34.842 --> 01:35:36.110
I want a divorce.

01:35:36.210 --> 01:35:37.277
(laughing)

01:35:37.377 --> 01:35:38.479
That's not a funny joke.

01:35:38.579 --> 01:35:40.180
We got this new baby here.

01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:41.682
Shouldn't be making jokes like that.

01:35:41.782 --> 01:35:44.251
I want you the hell out of my life.

01:35:44.351 --> 01:35:46.327
You are never to touch me,
ever again.

01:35:46.427 --> 01:35:47.721
I am done with you.

01:35:47.821 --> 01:35:50.756
If you ever come
within six yards of me,

01:35:50.856 --> 01:35:55.616
I will flatten your sorry ass,
and I will enjoy doing it.

01:35:59.083 --> 01:36:01.535
Now hold on a second.

01:36:01.635 --> 01:36:04.585

01:36:15.766 --> 01:36:18.766
(cooing)

01:36:25.843 --> 01:36:28.843
Lulu- that's your name.

01:36:30.981 --> 01:36:33.400
Little Lulu.

01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:37.240
We're going to have so much fun,
little girl.

01:36:37.888 --> 01:36:40.207
We're going to have

01:36:40.307 --> 01:36:43.257
so... much... fun.

01:36:46.630 --> 01:36:49.630

(door opens)

01:36:54.321 --> 01:36:56.523
BECKY:
Jenna, sweet,

01:36:56.623 --> 01:36:58.258
-you got to wake up.
- Hmm?

01:36:58.358 --> 01:36:59.927
DAWN:
We got to wake you. It's time to go.

01:37:00.027 --> 01:37:02.763
Earl's refusing to pay,
so they're kicking you out.

01:37:02.863 --> 01:37:04.364
- Oh, I can't go home.
- You gonna come stay

01:37:04.464 --> 01:37:06.467
with us for a while till
you get back on your feet.

01:37:06.567 --> 01:37:07.968
You could stay with us,

01:37:08.068 --> 01:37:10.637
but I thought Phil's convulsions
might frighten the baby.

01:37:10.737 --> 01:37:13.373
Oh, I got to see that baby!

01:37:13.473 --> 01:37:15.275
Oh, a beautiful baby girl!

01:37:15.375 --> 01:37:17.111
BECKY:
Oh...

01:37:17.211 --> 01:37:18.412
Look at that little girl!

01:37:18.512 --> 01:37:20.647
Cute little girl.

01:37:20.747 --> 01:37:22.449
Little, tiny baby girl.

01:37:22.549 --> 01:37:24.985
Lulu, the love of my life.

01:37:25.085 --> 01:37:28.060
Hon, we have some bad news for you.

01:37:28.505 --> 01:37:30.502
Old Joe was admitted
to the hospital

01:37:30.602 --> 01:37:31.492
same day you were.

01:37:31.592 --> 01:37:33.327
No, I know, he came by

01:37:33.427 --> 01:37:34.328
to see me.

01:37:34.428 --> 01:37:36.930
Well, he's not doing so well.

01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:38.899
In fact, he went into a coma

01:37:38.999 --> 01:37:41.001
and they don't think
he's going to recover.

01:37:41.101 --> 01:37:43.337
No! Oh, poor Joe.

01:37:43.437 --> 01:37:45.413
I know you like him.

01:37:45.513 --> 01:37:48.392
You're probably the only person alive
that likes him, though.

01:37:48.492 --> 01:37:49.443
Becky!

01:37:49.543 --> 01:37:51.378
I'm sorry,
but he's a scaly old gator.

01:37:51.478 --> 01:37:52.846
No, he's dear.

01:37:52.946 --> 01:37:54.948
He came in, he gave me this card.

01:37:55.048 --> 01:37:57.684
Where'd I put that?

01:37:57.784 --> 01:38:00.686
I set it down right over here.

01:38:00.786 --> 01:38:03.624
- Look at the baby. Look at that.
- She's so cute.

01:38:03.724 --> 01:38:06.626
Oh, the tiniest little hands.

01:38:06.726 --> 01:38:08.462
Look at the little nose.

01:38:08.562 --> 01:38:09.763
Oh, she's pretty.

01:38:09.863 --> 01:38:13.433
-Jenna, she's real pretty.
-Jenna, she's...

01:38:14.051 --> 01:38:16.470
# Little girl, little girl #

01:38:16.570 --> 01:38:19.306
# Little baby girl #

01:38:19.406 --> 01:38:21.875
#We love that baby girl #

01:38:21.975 --> 01:38:24.645
# She's the cutest baby in... #

01:38:24.745 --> 01:38:27.695
##

01:38:30.434 --> 01:38:33.434
(chuckles)

01:38:39.743 --> 01:38:42.743
(coughing)

01:38:44.248 --> 01:38:47.248
Is it a nice card?

01:38:48.151 --> 01:38:50.671
Yeah, it's okay.

01:38:50.771 --> 01:38:52.239
He made me a drawing.

01:38:52.339 --> 01:38:53.373
You want to see it?

01:38:53.473 --> 01:38:56.423
Yeah, okay.

01:38:59.229 --> 01:39:00.647
- Oh.
- Hmm.

01:39:00.747 --> 01:39:01.648
Isn't that nice?

01:39:01.748 --> 01:39:04.318
Yeah.

01:39:04.418 --> 01:39:06.520
It's pretty nice.

01:39:06.620 --> 01:39:08.922
Jenna?

01:39:09.022 --> 01:39:10.657
Jenna, where you going?

01:39:10.757 --> 01:39:13.193
Oh, they're kicking me out.

01:39:13.293 --> 01:39:14.361
Uh, ladies, would you mind

01:39:14.461 --> 01:39:16.445
if I had a minute
alone with my patient

01:39:16.545 --> 01:39:18.131
to talk to her before she leaves?

01:39:18.231 --> 01:39:19.132
Oh...

01:39:19.232 --> 01:39:20.434
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:39:20.534 --> 01:39:22.135
- Thanks.
- Here, Becky, take her.

01:39:22.235 --> 01:39:23.403
Oh, goodness.

01:39:23.503 --> 01:39:26.039
Come here, baby.
Come here, little baby.

01:39:26.139 --> 01:39:29.626
You come see Aunt Becky.
You come see Aunt Becky.

01:39:29.726 --> 01:39:30.911
Oh, my goodness.

01:39:31.011 --> 01:39:32.312
Thanks, ladies.

01:39:32.412 --> 01:39:33.580
Okay.

01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:36.550
Look at you.

01:39:36.650 --> 01:39:39.600
Dawn, look at her face.

01:39:44.408 --> 01:39:47.408
I know what you're thinking.

01:39:48.145 --> 01:39:49.429
No, I don't. That's a lie.

01:39:49.529 --> 01:39:50.931
What are you thinking?

01:39:51.031 --> 01:39:54.856
I'm thinking...
I could never thank you enough

01:39:56.286 --> 01:39:58.572
for everything you've done for me.

01:39:58.672 --> 01:40:01.375
I'm thinking
your wife's around

01:40:01.475 --> 01:40:03.043
and you probably shouldn't kiss me.

01:40:03.143 --> 01:40:05.912
The way she looks at you,

01:40:06.012 --> 01:40:08.962
so much trust.

01:40:11.501 --> 01:40:14.486
So that's it?

01:40:14.586 --> 01:40:16.590
It's over?
I don't have any say in this?

01:40:16.690 --> 01:40:20.077
We could have a big drama here
that gets drawn out for a couple years,

01:40:20.177 --> 01:40:21.528
makes everyone miserable.

01:40:21.628 --> 01:40:25.368
Or we could just end it
right here, you know?

01:40:26.183 --> 01:40:29.183
No body count, Just say bye-bye.

01:40:30.454 --> 01:40:33.454
I'm saying bye-bye.

01:40:35.292 --> 01:40:37.751
Dawn, wheel me off now, okay?

01:40:37.851 --> 01:40:38.945
DAWN:
Off? Okay.

01:40:39.045 --> 01:40:40.914
Wheel me off.

01:40:41.014 --> 01:40:43.964
Wait, wheel me back.

01:40:46.970 --> 01:40:49.456
Here...

01:40:49.556 --> 01:40:52.506
Take this.

01:40:54.411 --> 01:40:57.411
Okay, wheel me off again.

01:41:17.234 --> 01:41:19.222
DAWN:
What the heck was that all about?

01:41:19.322 --> 01:41:21.388
Oh, nothing.
I just had an affair with him.

01:41:21.488 --> 01:41:22.589
(gasps):
Your doctor?

01:41:22.689 --> 01:41:24.491
Yeah, and he's married.
Nice lady, too.

01:41:24.591 --> 01:41:26.159
Jenna!

01:41:26.259 --> 01:41:28.962
I just ended it for good.

01:41:29.062 --> 01:41:31.231
Here, give Lulu to me.

01:41:31.331 --> 01:41:33.467
Okay. Go see your mommy.

01:41:33.567 --> 01:41:34.968
(whispers):
Hi!

01:41:35.068 --> 01:41:38.468
Geez, I never seen a baby
this beautiful.

01:41:39.956 --> 01:41:41.808
You ever seen a baby this beautiful?

01:41:41.908 --> 01:41:44.858
No.

How do you say "good-bye"?

Bye, bye, bye!
