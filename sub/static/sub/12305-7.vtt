CSI Miami
Season 06 Episode 07

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
Toast to the season here in Miami,

00:08.600 --> 00:10.200
the Fashion season, that is

00:10.200 --> 00:14.400
designers, models and celebrities
is gathered from all over the world,

00:14.700 --> 00:18.000
to be part of the launch of
next year's Spring, Summer line

00:18.200 --> 00:21.274
Subtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.org

00:34.100 --> 00:36.500
and the show that kicks off the
week's long party,

00:38.000 --> 00:40.200
Miami's own Gavin Hauer.

00:40.400 --> 00:41.200
Thank you, Kirsten.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.500
Now who said the human body
was perfection?

00:43.600 --> 00:45.200
If it were,
it wouldn't break down.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.600
That's exactly why I chose platinum
as my muse.

00:49.400 --> 00:53.600
It's immortal-- it's me
improving on the original.

00:53.600 --> 00:54.500
Thank you, Kirsten.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.500
ANNOUNCER (over PA):
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:07.500 --> 01:10.400
introducing the new line
from Gavin Hauer.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.000
Are they canceling the show?

01:50.600 --> 01:52.200
Now do I have your attention?

02:01.000 --> 02:04.900
(music plays)

03:38.900 --> 03:40.000
What's her name, Alexx?

03:40.100 --> 03:41.400
Alisha Reilly.

03:41.400 --> 03:43.600
She was only 21.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.000
She got family here in Miami?

03:45.100 --> 03:48.000
No, Frank spoke
to them in Louisiana.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.800
She was their
only daughter.

03:50.300 --> 03:52.900
Horatio, moved to Miami
to be famous.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.600
Guess you t your wish, baby.

03:55.100 --> 03:56.600
Are those joule marks?

03:56.700 --> 03:57.200
Yep.

03:57.300 --> 03:58.000
Only get these kinds of burns

03:58.100 --> 04:01.400
with a massive electrical shock.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.900
This is where the current
exited her body.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.800
If you follow the burn marks,

04:05.800 --> 04:08.900
they'll trace back to where
the current entered her--

04:08.900 --> 04:11.600
her right hand
which is attached to the pole.

04:20.700 --> 04:23.200
Somebody killed
this girl, Alexx.

04:23.200 --> 04:25.900
Not a very private
place to kill someone.

04:25.900 --> 04:28.000
Because the killer
wanted it to be seen.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.400
Think someone was sending
a message?

04:33.200 --> 04:34.700
I do, Alexx.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.600
And I just got it.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.000
It was an accident.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.100
There's no way that
Alisha was murdered.

05:31.100 --> 05:33.100
A girl that nice
doesn't have any enemies.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.400
What about you?

05:35.200 --> 05:36.300
I don't have any either.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.600
Now I'm sorry
about what happened.

05:38.700 --> 05:40.800
I'll even dedicate
my next show to Alisha,

05:40.800 --> 05:42.800
but I've got to get
that stage packed up

05:42.800 --> 05:44.300
and on a plane to Paris.

05:44.300 --> 05:45.900
You're gonna have to find
another one, Mr. Hauer.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.500
Your stage is our crime scene.

05:48.900 --> 05:51.300
That stage is like the clothing
I design.

05:52.100 --> 05:52.900
I hand make it.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.300
It's one of a kind.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.700
So you rigged the pole
that killed the girl.

05:58.300 --> 06:00.400
I'm gonna let you in
on a trade secret.

06:00.700 --> 06:02.900
There's no money to be made
in fashion.

06:02.900 --> 06:04.100
It's all about staying
in the game long enough

06:04.100 --> 06:06.100
until your name
goes platinum.

06:06.300 --> 06:07.900
Why would I sabotage my own show?

06:08.700 --> 06:11.200
Maybe you've got
something to hide.

06:22.500 --> 06:23.400
You got anything?

06:23.400 --> 06:24.900
Come here and take a look
at this.

06:25.400 --> 06:26.700
All these lights

06:26.800 --> 06:30.200
are tagged with a girl's
name and her hair color.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.700
So this is Juliana's light.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.200
She has red hair.

06:33.900 --> 06:35.300
This is Lindsey's light.

06:35.800 --> 06:36.800
She's a brunette.

06:37.500 --> 06:38.800
And here's Alisha's.

06:38.800 --> 06:41.200
So each model had their
own lighting design.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.900
That means Alisha's
would've only been on

06:42.900 --> 06:44.600
when she was onstage.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.600
When Alisha's light got power,
she got power.

06:54.700 --> 06:56.900
(sizzling)

06:58.300 --> 06:59.700
But why didn't
she get electrocuted

06:59.700 --> 07:00.900
until she touched
the pole?

07:01.000 --> 07:03.600
Well, the killer had
to connect the two, right?

07:03.700 --> 07:05.100
My guess is it ran
something from

07:05.200 --> 07:07.900
the lights to this pole here.

07:16.600 --> 07:17.900
And here's the wire.

07:18.700 --> 07:20.500
Here's what's left
of the murder weapon.

07:22.800 --> 07:25.400
The killer used uninsulated wire
ensuring it would melt.

07:27.900 --> 07:29.300
Eliminating the evidence.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.400
You know, it certainly seems
like whoever did this

07:33.500 --> 07:35.300
knew that the evidence
would disappear.

07:35.700 --> 07:36.700
If you ask me, whoever did this,

07:36.800 --> 07:38.200
knew exactly
what they were doing.

07:39.400 --> 07:40.700
Like a lighting director?

07:44.000 --> 07:45.500
You're the lighting
director for the show,

07:45.600 --> 07:47.600
is that correct,
Mr. Kerr?
That's right.

07:47.900 --> 07:49.100
Why would there be a wire

07:49.100 --> 07:51.300
running from one of
Alisha Reilly's lights

07:51.300 --> 07:53.200
to a pole on the stage?

07:54.600 --> 07:56.200
No, there'd be
no reason for that.

07:56.500 --> 07:58.200
Unless someone wanted
to murder her.

07:58.500 --> 07:59.500
Don't look at me.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.500
I didn't have any problem
with that girl.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.300
What about your crew, any of
them have a problem with her?

08:03.300 --> 08:05.400
What crew?
Hauer was too cheap to hire one.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.000
I had to do the whole job
by myself.

08:07.600 --> 08:08.500
Th's why I know

08:09.300 --> 08:10.700
there's no way
this could've happened.

08:10.900 --> 08:13.200
Was there anybody else who had
access underneath the stage?

08:13.200 --> 08:15.200
I'm the only one with any reason
to be down there

08:15.300 --> 08:16.500
if that's what you mean.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.600
Makes you our number one
suspect.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.100
Don't go anywhere.

08:31.400 --> 08:34.200
Well, Terrence Kerr
was successful

08:34.200 --> 08:35.200
in only creating more

08:35.299 --> 08:36.299
suspicion for himself.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.200
He claims he was
the only person down here.

08:38.799 --> 08:40.400
Well, does he have red hair?

08:40.400 --> 08:42.000
No. Why?

08:42.000 --> 08:43.200
Because...

08:44.900 --> 08:46.300
somebody down here did.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.900
Well, that's an easy
mystery to solve.

08:49.100 --> 08:50.400
Which model had red hair?

08:52.400 --> 08:53.400
Juliana.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.200
Why are you trying to blame me?

08:57.500 --> 08:58.100
Well, actually,

08:58.200 --> 09:00.000
it's because we found
your hair under the stage.

09:00.100 --> 09:01.200
We're wondering why
a model would need

09:01.200 --> 09:02.600
to even be down there.

09:05.600 --> 09:06.800
Well, if I tell you,

09:07.400 --> 09:09.200
do you promise
not to say anything?

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Well, honestly, it depends
on what you tell me.

09:14.600 --> 09:16.100
Well, before each show,

09:16.400 --> 09:19.600
I always try to make nice
with the lighting guy.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.500
I mean,
you know how it is.

09:21.600 --> 09:24.000
Good lighting covers
a multitude of sins.

09:25.100 --> 09:26.100
So you...

09:27.600 --> 09:30.000
you were making nice
with Terrence Kerr

09:30.100 --> 09:31.100
under the stage?

09:31.600 --> 09:32.200
Yeah.

09:32.300 --> 09:33.700
Yeah, it was
kind of cramped.

09:37.200 --> 09:39.000
Shh! Someone will hear us.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.600
Did Alisha ever get, uh...

09:45.900 --> 09:47.000
involved with Mr. Kerr?

09:47.100 --> 09:48.600
No, she didn't mess around.

09:50.400 --> 09:53.600
Alisha was kind of boring.

09:53.900 --> 09:55.700
Did she have many friends
outside of work?

09:56.100 --> 09:57.300
It's hard to say.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.700
She kept her personal
life to herself.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.200
Did she do anything
different lately?

10:02.300 --> 10:04.200
Did she do anything
out of character?

10:05.300 --> 10:07.300
She was late for
rehearsal last night.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.100
Didn't show for
over an hour.

10:10.200 --> 10:11.800
And when she did,
it looked like

10:11.800 --> 10:12.800
she'd been crying.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.100
You know what I mean.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.700
I do, Ms. Ravez.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.400
Thank you.
You're free to go.

10:28.900 --> 10:30.200
That didn't get us anywhere.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Well, we know that
Alisha was upset.

10:33.400 --> 10:36.000
Yeah, but why would a 21-
year-old girl get so upset

10:36.100 --> 10:37.600
that she'd show up
late for work?

10:37.900 --> 10:38.900
That's easy.

10:39.200 --> 10:40.200
Boyfriend.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.300
Hey, Alexx, do me
a favor, would you?

10:43.600 --> 10:46.000
Rush a sex kit
on Alisha Reilly.

10:52.700 --> 10:53.900
Can I have some
space, please,

10:54.000 --> 10:55.400
so I can finish this?

10:55.700 --> 10:56.700
Right, sorry, okay.

10:56.700 --> 10:58.800
We're just short on
good leads with this one.

10:59.900 --> 11:00.900
I'm not.

11:01.300 --> 11:02.900
Looks like our
victim was married.

11:03.400 --> 11:04.000
How can you tell that

11:04.000 --> 11:07.700
from a sex kit?
Because it comes back to a
guy currently serving time,

11:07.800 --> 11:09.300
and the only way you
can have a conjugal visit

11:09.400 --> 11:10.700
with a prisoner is if
you're married to them.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.300
So who's she married to?

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Joe LeBrock.

11:15.100 --> 11:16.200
LeBrock.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.800
That's the guy
who kidnapped Horatio's son.

11:17.900 --> 11:18.700
Yeah. No wonder why Alisha

11:18.800 --> 11:20.400
was keeping her
personal life a secret.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.100
Yeah, well, I would, too,
if I was married

11:22.100 --> 11:23.700
to one of the most
dangerous men in Miami.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.700
H, it's Eric.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.100
You never told me you
were married, Joe.

11:38.800 --> 11:39.600
Alisha and I hooked up

11:39.600 --> 11:41.400
just before I became
a guest of the county.

11:41.900 --> 11:43.300
You know she's a model.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.800
Guys in here go crazy when
she comes strutting in.

11:46.400 --> 11:47.800
It sounds like it.

11:47.800 --> 11:48.600
Well, Joe,

11:48.600 --> 11:50.200
that part of the journey
is over.

11:50.200 --> 11:52.100
Alisha was killed this morning.

11:53.600 --> 11:56.000
And you came all the way
out here to tell me yourself?

11:56.000 --> 11:57.300
I am so touched.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.000
I don't get
the connection, Joe.

11:59.700 --> 12:02.200
To be crude--
a conjugal's a conjugal.

12:02.300 --> 12:04.200
Right, but what's
in it for her?

12:04.400 --> 12:05.800
I set her up as a model.

12:06.800 --> 12:09.400
Okay. So that's how
she met Gavin Hauer.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.000
I know a lot of people.
Yes,

12:11.100 --> 12:13.900
from your hero dealing.
When I first
met Alisha,

12:14.000 --> 12:16.700
she was straight off the bus,
she needed my help.

12:17.200 --> 12:18.800
I made her dreams come true.

12:18.800 --> 12:21.400
But she left here
the other day in tears.

12:22.300 --> 12:23.400
Oh, I see.

12:23.700 --> 12:26.300
So you think I killed my wife.

12:27.100 --> 12:28.900
A bit difficult
for a man in my situation.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.600
You have people on the outside.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.100
Like you do in here.

12:33.900 --> 12:35.100
By the way,

12:35.500 --> 12:38.600
Oscar's a great choice
as a bodyguard for your son.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.800
Loyal,
not too smart.

12:40.900 --> 12:42.400
(door buzzes)
I'm glad you approve.

12:43.600 --> 12:44.700
What happens now?

12:49.600 --> 12:50.600
LeBROCK:
I don't know.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.300
I get the sense...

12:53.200 --> 12:55.300
Balance of power's about to shift...

13:20.300 --> 13:21.500
Look, man, why don't you
go do some warm-ups

13:21.600 --> 13:22.900
by the chin-up bar?

13:31.800 --> 13:32.900
You staying out of trouble?

13:33.600 --> 13:34.900
It hasn't been too easy.

13:35.800 --> 13:37.400
It's about to get
more complicated.

13:37.900 --> 13:38.700
What do you mean?

13:39.600 --> 13:40.900
Trust no one.

13:41.900 --> 13:42.800
What about Oscar?

13:43.100 --> 13:44.400
Oscar has a problem.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.300
Take care, son.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.600
You've got a pair
of eyes on you.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.100
You think I don't know that?

14:00.100 --> 14:01.100
Watch your back.

14:09.100 --> 14:10.300
Hey there, Frank.

14:10.900 --> 14:11.900
Please tell me
there's a good reason

14:12.000 --> 14:13.900
you dragged me into this
charming little establishment.

14:14.200 --> 14:15.900
Besides the
amazing joy I get

14:16.000 --> 14:17.300
from knowing you've
been inconvenienced,

14:17.300 --> 14:18.400
I need you to do
something for me.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.300
Okay, what is that?
We need
to find out

14:20.400 --> 14:22.200
who LeBrock's giving
orders to on the outside.

14:22.500 --> 14:24.500
Maybe he had one of his goons
kill his wife for him.

14:24.700 --> 14:26.400
Now, been checking the
jail's visitation logs.

14:26.500 --> 14:28.100
Okay, so you need help reading.

14:28.800 --> 14:29.900
That's cute.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.400
Aside from Alisha,
he's had only one visitor,

14:32.500 --> 14:34.800
which is a guy
named Scott Garnet.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.600
Okay, so why exactly
do you need me to be here?

14:37.800 --> 14:39.200
Scott Garnet doesn't exist.

14:39.400 --> 14:40.900
The address and phone
he left are fake.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.900
Now, he met
LeBrock here

14:43.000 --> 14:44.900
shortly after Alisha left,
so I need you,

14:44.900 --> 14:46.700
my favorite dust monkey,
to lift prints

14:46.800 --> 14:48.100
off visitor stall
number four.

14:49.500 --> 14:52.900
Yeah. But there's got to be
dozens of prints over there.
Ye.

14:52.900 --> 14:54.400
Means you better get busy.

15:42.300 --> 15:43.400
Take a look at this one.

15:46.300 --> 15:47.400
Scott LeBrock.

15:48.900 --> 15:50.000
Joe has a son?

15:50.600 --> 15:52.700
It looks like we found
our Scott Garnet.

16:07.300 --> 16:10.300
My father is not an easy man
to get along with.

16:13.600 --> 16:14.800
I don't see him anymore.

16:15.200 --> 16:15.900
Yes, but, Scott,

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
you just visited him
in jail the other day

16:18.000 --> 16:19.600
under a false name,
didn't you?

16:20.300 --> 16:23.100
Youtry carrying around
LeBrock as a last name.

16:23.200 --> 16:25.000
That's the only reason
you dragged me in here--

16:25.100 --> 16:26.100
because of my father.

16:26.100 --> 16:29.800
I dragged you in here because
your stepmother Alisha is dead.

16:31.600 --> 16:32.800
I didn't know the chick.

16:32.800 --> 16:34.400
My father never talked
about her to me.

16:35.900 --> 16:37.900
What did you guys
talk about, then?

16:49.800 --> 16:51.200
That's between me and him.

16:52.800 --> 16:54.100
Not anymore.
(knocking on glass)

17:00.100 --> 17:01.200
CAINE:
Keep an eye on him.

17:06.200 --> 17:07.500
Is that Scott LeBrock?

17:07.599 --> 17:09.599
As a matter of
fact, it is.

17:10.099 --> 17:11.900
I just received a call
from the FBI.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.700
They have their own
ongoing investigation into him.

17:16.599 --> 17:17.599
CAINE:
He's under surveillance?

17:17.700 --> 17:21.200
For what?
Justice Department
thinks he's wrapped up

17:21.200 --> 17:23.000
They don't want him
to get spooked.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.200
They're asking us to back off

17:24.200 --> 17:25.599
Okay, what if he's my connection

17:25.700 --> 17:28.700
between LeBrock
and the victim, Rick?
I'm sorry, Horatio.

17:28.900 --> 17:30.900
The Feds are coming down
hard on this.

17:31.600 --> 17:33.400
Brass feels we should comply.

17:34.700 --> 17:36.000
I understand.

17:41.300 --> 17:42.700
I'm serious about this.

17:42.800 --> 17:43.900
Don't mess with them.

17:44.200 --> 17:45.400
I agree, Rick.

17:46.800 --> 17:47.700
Anything else?

17:49.200 --> 17:50.900
No.
Thank you.

17:52.200 --> 17:55.500
Natalia, your connections
at the FBI-- I need them.

18:05.300 --> 18:07.300
BOA VISTA:
Special Agent Farallon.

18:07.700 --> 18:08.700
B.V.

18:08.700 --> 18:10.500
You look good.
Thanks.

18:10.900 --> 18:12.600
Thanks for coming--
I really appreciate it, Mike.

18:14.100 --> 18:15.100
Are you kidding?

18:15.500 --> 18:17.300
You saved my career
three years ago.

18:17.700 --> 18:19.000
(laughs):
On that Sonora case.

18:19.300 --> 18:20.700
You know, that was some
of the worst preserved blood

18:20.800 --> 18:22.000
I think I'd ever seen.

18:22.100 --> 18:23.600
And you were able
to replicate it.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.600
Or... whatever
it is that you do.

18:25.700 --> 18:26.500
Yeah.

18:27.500 --> 18:28.500
So, what do you need?

18:29.600 --> 18:31.600
Does the name Scott LeBrock
sound familiar?

18:32.800 --> 18:34.000
What, have you been
keeping tabs on me?

18:35.400 --> 18:36.700
On the record,
we're not

18:36.800 --> 18:39.700
surveilling him; he's not part
of an ongoing investigation.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.600
Tell that to the young woman
that's in the morgue,

18:41.700 --> 18:43.800
'cause we think that Scott
might be linked to her murder.

18:45.600 --> 18:47.000
Don't know anything about that.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.800
Come on.
Sorry, B.V., it's
strictly "need to know."

18:49.900 --> 18:51.400
What about
the surveillance teams?

18:52.300 --> 18:53.000
Can't do it.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.300
Look, Mike, does what you know
trump what I know

18:59.400 --> 19:00.600
about you?

19:02.200 --> 19:03.300
I need those tapes.

19:07.500 --> 19:08.900
Would this make us even?

19:15.100 --> 19:16.500
I need the tapes today,

19:17.200 --> 19:19.600
and I'll get 'em back to you
before you ever need an excuse.

19:33.500 --> 19:34.500
How's it coming?

19:35.000 --> 19:37.800
Good. The XRF confirms
that the wire used

19:37.900 --> 19:41.300
to electrocute Alisha Reilly
was a platinum alloy.

19:42.600 --> 19:43.300
Wow.

19:43.700 --> 19:45.200
That's a rare metal,
not to mention

19:45.300 --> 19:47.400
if there's a low nickel content,
it's very expensive.

19:47.600 --> 19:48.400
That's why I'm testing it

19:48.500 --> 19:50.900
against the wire used
in Alisha's dress.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.300
They both have the
same nickel percentage.
So that means

20:04.400 --> 20:06.100
that wire came from
the same batch of platinum

20:06.200 --> 20:07.900
that Gavin used
in his clothing line.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.500
He said he made
every piece by hand.

20:10.900 --> 20:12.300
I would say he had a hand

20:12.400 --> 20:14.100
in more than just
designing the clothes.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Mr. Hauer,

20:36.300 --> 20:38.300
can I ask you a few
more questions, please?

20:38.600 --> 20:40.200
I've already told you
everything I know.

20:40.600 --> 20:42.100
Well, you neglected
to mention

20:42.200 --> 20:43.900
that Alisha was killed
with a platinum wire

20:43.900 --> 20:46.700
that matches the platinum
you use in your clothing line.

20:46.800 --> 20:47.900
That's because I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.300
Every piece in this line
has platinum in it.

20:51.200 --> 20:52.900
Then I'm gonna need
to take all the clothes.

20:54.200 --> 20:55.500
(laughs):
You already got my stage.

20:55.900 --> 20:56.900
You can't have the clothes.

20:56.900 --> 20:58.900
The clothes go to Paris
for a show in two days.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.100
Mr. Hauer, the evidence
is in our favor.

21:01.200 --> 21:03.000
It's not gonna be hard for me
to get a warrant.

21:03.100 --> 21:05.100
Well, then I'll give my lawyer
the heads up.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.300
Hauer's lawyers
are throwing up roadblocks,

21:14.400 --> 21:16.300
so it's gonna be a while
before we get a warrant.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.100
At least we have
Alisha's outfit.

21:18.200 --> 21:19.800
Yeah, I got it from Wolfe.

21:20.200 --> 21:22.000
Getting a strange
smell from this.

21:22.100 --> 21:22.900
Here.

21:24.300 --> 21:24.900
Mm.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.400
It smells like vinegar.
Yeah,

21:26.400 --> 21:27.800
but only in the burnt areas.

21:27.900 --> 21:29.700
Must he been released
during the electrocution.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.000
Huh.

21:38.200 --> 21:40.200
Why are you testing
for drugs?
I helped out

21:40.300 --> 21:42.900
on this bust a few
months ago in Key West,

21:43.400 --> 21:45.900
and, uh, the dealers,
they torched the place.

21:46.700 --> 21:48.200
By the time the
fire was put out,

21:49.200 --> 21:52.600
we went back and there
was this distinct smell.

22:02.600 --> 22:03.700
It's heroin.

22:05.900 --> 22:07.300
It's weird because
I checked before

22:07.400 --> 22:10.100
and I didn't find any
drug residue on the fabric.

22:10.200 --> 22:12.700
That's because
it's not on the fabric.

22:13.100 --> 22:14.600
<i>It is the fabric.</i>

22:17.200 --> 22:20.900
MDPD, everyone in here out
front and against the wall.

22:21.400 --> 22:22.300
Mr. Hauer.

22:22.500 --> 22:23.800
HAUER:
You better have a warrant.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.100
Merry Christmas.

22:39.500 --> 22:41.500
Wow, this is quite a lab
you have set up here.

22:41.700 --> 22:43.100
I dye my own fabric.

22:43.800 --> 22:45.000
Oh, let me ask you.

22:45.100 --> 22:46.600
Is heroin the new black?

22:47.400 --> 22:49.200
Because Alisha Reilly's
clothes were made of it.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.200
That's insane.

22:51.300 --> 22:52.500
Let me tell you what I know.

22:52.900 --> 22:55.200
Heroin in its purest
form is a liquid.

22:55.700 --> 22:58.300
<i>It's smuggled here,
probably from Mexico.</i>

22:58.600 --> 23:01.100
<i>You soak your clothing
in a concentrated solution,</i>

23:01.200 --> 23:02.500
<i>infusing it with heroin.</i>

23:06.700 --> 23:09.400
<i>When the clothes reach their
destination, they go on show.</i>

23:09.500 --> 23:10.800
<i>No one's the wiser.</i>

23:12.700 --> 23:15.300
<i>After the show, they're put
in a separating vat.</i>

23:15.800 --> 23:18.600
<i>The heroin's extracted
using a chemical process.</i>

23:21.600 --> 23:24.300
<i>You put the extracted heroin
into an oven</i>

23:24.500 --> 23:26.000
<i>and cook the liquid
into a solid</i>

23:26.200 --> 23:28.000
<i>which is then sold
on the street.</i>

23:29.500 --> 23:31.000
It'called
"heroin starching."

23:32.100 --> 23:33.900
You're smuggling drugs
with your clothes.

23:34.600 --> 23:36.000
In every country
we've been to,

23:38.100 --> 23:39.600
no one ever checked the clothes.

23:39.800 --> 23:41.100
Except Alisha Reilly.

23:41.400 --> 23:43.400
She was going to stop you
from going to Paris.

23:43.800 --> 23:44.700
That's why you killed her.

23:44.800 --> 23:46.400
I told you I had
nothing to do with that.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.200
Yeah, well,
did Joe LeBrock?

23:48.900 --> 23:50.500
That's precisely why
I didn't kill her.

23:50.800 --> 23:53.300
You'd have to be crazy or stupid
to kill LeBrock's girl.

23:53.400 --> 23:54.500
So you know Joe?

23:56.100 --> 23:58.000
That's who you were
smuggling the heroin for.

23:58.800 --> 24:00.500
You guys think I'm
gonna roll on LeBrock?

24:01.600 --> 24:04.300
Like I said, stupid and crazy.

24:10.700 --> 24:11.300
I bet Horatio's

24:11.300 --> 24:13.100
gonna want to have
a conversation with LeBrock.

24:14.500 --> 24:15.300
I'm sure.

24:22.200 --> 24:25.000
Mouth shut.
You're here to work, ladies.

24:27.200 --> 24:28.700
You two, move apart.

24:29.300 --> 24:30.600
Oscar, eyes on the work!

24:32.300 --> 24:35.800
LeBrock... someone
wants to see you.

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
Lieutenant, shouldn't you be out
catching my wife's killer?

24:46.300 --> 24:48.400
That's exactly what
I'm doing here, Joe.

24:49.300 --> 24:52.100
We busted Gavin Hauer's
heroin operation.

24:52.700 --> 24:54.400
Now, why would
that matter to me?

24:54.600 --> 24:57.600
Because Gavin was smuggling
for you, wasn't he?

24:58.700 --> 25:00.900
Good luck getting anyone
to testify to that.

25:02.500 --> 25:05.100
I guess somebody should have
mentioned that to Alisha, huh?

25:05.100 --> 25:06.000
Why's that?

25:06.100 --> 25:06.900
Because Alisha
found out

25:07.000 --> 25:08.900
about the smuggling,
didn't she?

25:09.400 --> 25:10.900
Let's just say she didn't
understand

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
the world of business,
so I straightened her out.

25:17.100 --> 25:19.200
Everyone stay on the ground!

25:19.300 --> 25:20.700
We have an explosion
on site at Cooper Park.

25:21.100 --> 25:22.900
Possible critical injuries.

25:22.900 --> 25:23.900
That wasn't necessary, Joe.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.600
Get me Rescue down here
immediately, right now.

25:27.100 --> 25:27.900
Oscar!

25:32.700 --> 25:33.400
Rescue's coming.

25:33.500 --> 25:35.100
I'm sor... I'm sorry, man.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.600
I want you to hang on, okay?

25:36.600 --> 25:39.000
I tried to do right.
I did what you said.

25:39.100 --> 25:40.000
You did, Oscar.

25:43.400 --> 25:45.900
Everything.
And I won't forget it.

25:48.100 --> 25:49.200
LeBrock, let's go.

26:04.400 --> 26:05.500
DELKO:
According to the CO,

26:05.600 --> 26:07.500
the inmates were assigned
to this area for a week.

26:07.700 --> 26:10.200
Oscar had been working this
stump the past few days.

26:10.300 --> 26:12.300
DUQUESNE:
So whoever planted the bomb
would have known that.

26:12.700 --> 26:14.000
I mean, LeBrock is part
of the crew.

26:14.100 --> 26:16.100
It's not hard to imagine
that he did it.

26:16.100 --> 26:18.000
Except there were
too many guards around.

26:22.600 --> 26:24.500
What have you got?

26:27.400 --> 26:28.700
Got a sim card.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.100
From a cell phone?

26:30.100 --> 26:33.500
Yeah, cell phones make great
trigger devices for bombs.

26:33.500 --> 26:36.100
All one has to do is make
a simple phone call.

26:48.600 --> 26:49.700
Sim card's
a cell phone's memory,

26:49.800 --> 26:52.600
which means that
if this is intact,

26:52.600 --> 26:54.100
the bomber's
phone number's in here.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.300
WOLFE:
Well, you know, it doesn't
look too damaged.

27:02.700 --> 27:04.100
This will tell us
for sure.

27:08.500 --> 27:10.100
Okay, that's the number
of the caller

27:10.200 --> 27:11.500
that detonated
the bomb.

27:12.100 --> 27:13.800
Can you try
reverse phone directory?

27:13.900 --> 27:14.600
Sure.

27:18.900 --> 27:21.100
You picked up the surface
computing quickly.

27:21.500 --> 27:23.600
Wasn't that hard.
Samantha got me up to speed.

27:24.400 --> 27:26.200
So you were just using it
as an excuse

27:26.300 --> 27:28.400
to hit on the new girl?

27:28.400 --> 27:31.600
Yeah, she, she, uh,
saw through it, too.

27:32.600 --> 27:35.300
Okay, there's no name
attached to the cell phone.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
This is a prepaid cell.

27:38.800 --> 27:40.300
What about a service provider?

27:43.500 --> 27:44.200
Service provider

27:44.200 --> 27:47.200
is FlorCom Mobile.

27:47.600 --> 27:49.300
Can you use that to get me
a location on the call?

27:49.500 --> 27:49.800
I can't get you a location,

27:50.800 --> 27:52.600
but I can get you
the nearest cell tower.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.500
The call originated
from a cell tower

27:58.600 --> 28:00.800
at Tamiami Trail and Kenwood.

28:01.800 --> 28:03.000
Not a lot of civilization
out there.

28:03.100 --> 28:04.300
That's the Everglades.

28:04.300 --> 28:05.000
That's where

28:05.100 --> 28:07.400
the Miami-Dade Department
of Detention is located.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.100
Call came from inside
the building.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.000
MAN (over P.A.)
Evacuate cell block D.

28:15.100 --> 28:16.800
Prepare to be searched.

28:39.600 --> 28:40.500
Next cell.

29:13.100 --> 29:14.300
Where'd you get the phone?

29:15.600 --> 29:16.700
I've never seen it before.

29:16.700 --> 29:18.800
They found it under
your bunk, Kyle.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.100
It's not mine.

29:20.400 --> 29:22.600
Kyle, they're gonna
charge you for murder.

29:25.100 --> 29:26.500
It's not my cell phone, okay?

29:27.200 --> 29:28.600
Who had access to your bunk?

29:32.100 --> 29:33.100
I don't know.

29:33.600 --> 29:35.100
Did LeBrock have access?

29:44.300 --> 29:46.100
You know what?
I'm not your snitch, okay?!

29:46.100 --> 29:47.100
Do this yourself.

29:49.100 --> 29:50.500
Guard, I'm done with this guy.

29:58.800 --> 30:01.000
Calleigh says that
you are the A/V wiz.

30:01.100 --> 30:01.900
Is that right?

30:02.000 --> 30:03.900
Well, my reputation
precedes me.

30:04.000 --> 30:04.900
In fact, one time...

30:05.000 --> 30:07.700
Awesome, because
I need you to go through

30:07.800 --> 30:09.900
all these surveillance
videos of Scott LeBrock

30:10.000 --> 30:11.400
and see if you can find
anything that would connect

30:11.500 --> 30:12.500
his father to the bombing

30:12.600 --> 30:14.500
or to the murder
of Alisha Reilly.

30:16.600 --> 30:17.300
Where'd you get these?

30:17.300 --> 30:18.400
The FBI.

30:18.500 --> 30:20.100
They suspect him
of a federal crime.

30:20.200 --> 30:22.300
I don't know what it is,
but here's the DVDs.

30:23.000 --> 30:23.900
How many hours
of video

30:23.900 --> 30:25.200
you got here?

30:25.300 --> 30:27.100
Oh, like, five-weeks worth.

30:27.800 --> 30:28.700
Hey.

30:29.900 --> 30:30.900
Where you going?

30:31.000 --> 30:32.400
I got it, you watch it.

30:40.500 --> 30:41.900
You know, I still
haven't found the dress

30:42.000 --> 30:43.100
missing the platinum string

30:43.200 --> 30:44.800
that was used
to kill Alisha Reilly.

30:44.900 --> 30:47.000
But we know that the killer
could have only taken the wire

30:47.100 --> 30:48.100
from one of these dresses,

30:48.100 --> 30:49.500
so it has
to be here.

30:53.900 --> 30:54.700
Take a look at this.

30:56.100 --> 30:56.900
String's not missing,

30:57.000 --> 30:58.600
but it doesn't look
like platinum.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.600
Pass me the XRF, please?

31:03.000 --> 31:03.800
Yeah.

31:11.900 --> 31:14.200
DUQUESNE:
Nothing platinum about this.

31:14.300 --> 31:16.200
Those are alloys found
in aluminum foil.

31:16.300 --> 31:18.700
I think foil's a little
low-rent for Gavin, don't you?

31:19.000 --> 31:21.800
Not if you're looking
to replace a platinum
string in a hurry.

31:22.900 --> 31:23.900
Whose dress is it?

31:25.800 --> 31:29.100
It's the red-haired model--
Juliana Ravez.

31:29.400 --> 31:31.000
I think we just found
our killer.

31:33.200 --> 31:35.700
You put on a pretty
good act this morning,
didn't you, Juliana.

31:36.800 --> 31:37.400
I'm sorry?

31:37.500 --> 31:38.900
DELKO:
The dress you wore
in the show.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.400
It's missing
a platinum string.

31:40.500 --> 31:42.400
which you replaced
with an aluminum one.

31:43.600 --> 31:44.300
So?

31:44.400 --> 31:47.200
That platinum string
from your dress,

31:47.400 --> 31:49.400
it was used to rig the light
that electrocuted Alisha.

31:49.700 --> 31:51.700
But how would I even know
how to do that?

31:52.000 --> 31:53.200
Oh, come on.
You said it yourself.

31:53.200 --> 31:56.200
You have a habit of making nice
with the lighting guys.

31:56.600 --> 31:58.400
I'm sure you picked up
a few tricks.

32:16.800 --> 32:18.800
That string's just as good
as a smoking gun.

32:27.100 --> 32:29.000
She had such a good thing going.

32:29.300 --> 32:31.600
You knew why Alisha
was upset last night.

32:31.700 --> 32:33.100
She told you about
the heroin.

32:34.100 --> 32:35.500
Like I didn't know.

32:37.200 --> 32:39.000
Well, who did you think
you were marrying?

32:39.400 --> 32:41.100
I can't be involved
in this, Juliana.

32:41.100 --> 32:42.700
I have to go
to the police.

32:43.200 --> 32:44.300
Just calm down.

32:44.800 --> 32:47.500
We'll do the show and then we'll
talk to someone, okay?

32:49.800 --> 32:51.400
DELKO:
So did Joe have
you kill her?

32:52.300 --> 32:54.000
Joe had nothing to do with it.

32:54.700 --> 32:56.300
So you're saying
Joe doesn't know?

32:57.500 --> 32:59.200
She wasn't worthy of him...

33:00.200 --> 33:01.900
but I've proven that I am.

33:03.200 --> 33:05.200
So you want LeBrock
for yourself.

33:05.500 --> 33:07.100
He treated her like a queen.

33:09.700 --> 33:11.300
I would have killed
to have that.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
And you did.

33:25.800 --> 33:26.500
Well, what do you think?

33:26.500 --> 33:28.600
Can we charge LeBrock
for inspiring a murder?

33:29.200 --> 33:32.000
No, but we can still get him
on the bombing.

33:32.400 --> 33:33.200
Yeah, well, we'd better hurry up

33:33.300 --> 33:35.000
because Kyle's time
is running out.

33:54.400 --> 33:55.900
You lied to me, Kyle.

33:56.500 --> 33:57.600
I don't know what
you're talking about.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.400
The phone belongs to you.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.600
All the calls were made
to a number in Pensacola.

34:02.700 --> 34:03.700
I know that number.

34:03.800 --> 34:05.600
It used to belong
to your mother.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.100
I want to find her.

34:07.400 --> 34:09.500
Did you make the call
that detonated the bomb?

34:12.400 --> 34:13.699
I need you to believe me.

34:14.199 --> 34:15.100
I didn't do it.

34:15.199 --> 34:16.500
Who gave you the phone?

34:19.000 --> 34:20.300
Joe LeBrock.

34:21.699 --> 34:23.300
He said it was
a peace offering.

34:28.100 --> 34:28.900
Hey, kid.

34:30.699 --> 34:33.100
Now, I don't know what
you've heard about me,

34:33.100 --> 34:36.300
but you know I'd be a fool
to try to hurt you now.

34:37.300 --> 34:40.100
I know how hard it can be for
a family to find time to visit.

34:41.300 --> 34:44.000
At least you can tell them
how you're doing.

34:52.300 --> 34:53.199
Hey, kid.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.199
Just keep it hidden.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.200
I'm sorry.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.600
There is a way out of this,
but you can't lie to me.

35:04.400 --> 35:06.400
Never lie to me again.

35:20.600 --> 35:23.300
The only viable prints I pulled
off the phone belong to Kyle.

35:23.700 --> 35:25.000
It's not looking
good for him.

35:25.100 --> 35:26.600
Yeah, but it doesn't
mean that he did it.

35:26.800 --> 35:27.600
'Cause Horatio
thinks somebody

35:27.600 --> 35:29.400
may have stolen the phone
and made that call.

35:29.900 --> 35:31.700
Let's hope the court
sees it that way.

35:31.900 --> 35:33.200
Well, I found trace
all over the phone.

35:33.300 --> 35:35.000
so I'm hoping that's
going to help us out.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.800
Equal parts
carbon black pigment,

35:41.900 --> 35:43.600
mineral oil and dispersant.

35:43.900 --> 35:44.600
Some kind of ink?

35:44.700 --> 35:46.700
Yeah, but there's no
quick-dry agent present.

35:46.800 --> 35:48.200
So it's not from a pen.

35:48.200 --> 35:50.300
But you know what doesn't
use a quick-dry agent?

35:50.500 --> 35:51.300
Fingerprint ink.

35:51.400 --> 35:52.600
So it would have to be
from somebody

35:52.700 --> 35:54.400
who was recently processed
into detention.

35:55.100 --> 35:56.600
MAN:
No talking in the print line.

35:58.700 --> 36:00.000
And Kyle's been in there
for weeks.

36:00.100 --> 36:02.000
Check the, uh, detention
center database.

36:02.100 --> 36:04.900
See who was processed just
before the time of the bombing.

36:12.600 --> 36:14.200
Okay, we've got it
narrowed down to three.

36:14.900 --> 36:16.500
That's about as close as we're
going to get for right now.

36:16.600 --> 36:18.400
Then Horatio's going to have
to talk to all of them.

36:23.500 --> 36:24.500
These bruises?

36:24.700 --> 36:25.800
Got them from a bunch
of guys who jumped me

36:25.900 --> 36:27.300
right after I processed in.

36:27.700 --> 36:29.400
Happens to everyone
on their first day.

36:29.900 --> 36:31.800
I played the game; didn't look
anyone in the eye, you know.

36:31.900 --> 36:33.000
A cell phone?

36:33.800 --> 36:34.800
I didn't think you could have

36:34.800 --> 36:36.100
a cell phone in prison.

36:36.300 --> 36:37.500
I don't even know
where the bathrooms are.

36:37.600 --> 36:39.300
You think I could find
some kid's cell?

36:39.700 --> 36:41.000
LeBrock, yeah.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.400
The CO told me
to stay away from him.

36:43.700 --> 36:45.200
Who doesn't know LeBrock?

36:46.200 --> 36:47.600
Don't know a guy named LeBrock.

36:47.700 --> 36:50.800
Come on, Corey, everybody
in your world knows Joe.

36:50.900 --> 36:52.800
He got to you right after
you were processed in

36:52.800 --> 36:55.600
and he's just offered you
protection, hasn't he?

36:55.700 --> 36:57.700
That's why you
don't have any bruises.

36:57.700 --> 36:59.000
I don't need
anyone's protection.

36:59.500 --> 37:01.100
Then why did you
do him a favor?

37:04.800 --> 37:07.800
The ink on your fingers
isn't even dry yet.

37:34.900 --> 37:37.200
Corey, I understand that
you're looking at a year.

37:39.100 --> 37:40.600
And if you sign
this confession,

37:40.600 --> 37:43.200
I'll make sure it doesn't
get kicked up to life.

37:49.800 --> 37:53.000
If I sign one,
it becomes my death sentence.

37:54.300 --> 37:55.500
You decide.

38:06.900 --> 38:07.800
CAINE:
Miss Nevins.

38:08.800 --> 38:11.300
I'm assuming you know
Kyle's hearing is later today.

38:12.100 --> 38:13.100
I do.

38:13.500 --> 38:15.800
The evidence that Kyle's
responsible for the bombing

38:15.900 --> 38:17.200
was overwhelming.

38:19.600 --> 38:21.400
Rebecca, what if I
were to tell you

38:21.500 --> 38:24.300
I have an inmate who claims
to have detonated the bomb?

38:24.600 --> 38:26.100
Is he willing to testify?

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
I'm working on it.

38:28.100 --> 38:29.400
You're going to have
to do better than that,

38:29.500 --> 38:30.900
'cause a witness
just came forward

38:31.000 --> 38:32.500
who's willing to testify
under oath

38:32.600 --> 38:34.200
that he sold Kyle
that cell phone.

38:34.500 --> 38:36.300
And by witness,
you mean Joe LeBrock?

38:36.400 --> 38:37.500
Doesn't matter
who it is.

38:37.500 --> 38:39.500
It matters if he's
behind the bomb.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.800
Horatio, I have to present
the strongest case.

38:48.400 --> 38:49.000
You know, I've been through

38:49.100 --> 38:51.000
every hour of this
surveillance video,

38:51.000 --> 38:52.700
and I haven't found
anything that suggests

38:52.700 --> 38:54.400
that Scott LeBrock is
working for his father.

38:55.200 --> 38:56.400
There's gotta be something.

38:57.700 --> 38:59.300
There is, but it's not
what you think.

39:01.400 --> 39:02.600
WOLFE:
It's got LeBrock
from two weeks ago.

39:02.700 --> 39:04.500
He doesn't know
he's being surveilled.

39:05.600 --> 39:06.400
BOA VISTA:
They're in a park.

39:06.400 --> 39:08.000
It's a good place
for a clandestine meeting.

39:09.300 --> 39:10.900
Clandestine meeting
with a little boy?

39:14.400 --> 39:15.700
Hey, buddy.
Hey!

39:15.800 --> 39:16.800
Want to go for
another ride?

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
What are we watching?

39:18.300 --> 39:19.900
Yeah. Can you buy me
another video game?

39:19.900 --> 39:22.200
Scott LeBrock.
He's a pedophile.

39:22.500 --> 39:23.500
Now, your Fed buddies

39:23.600 --> 39:25.100
rushed in and pulled
the kid out,

39:26.300 --> 39:27.500
but they never
arrest him.

39:28.100 --> 39:29.500
No, check it out.
They did.

39:29.500 --> 39:31.100
That's the agent
I got the video from.

39:32.700 --> 39:34.100
So they just let him go?

39:34.200 --> 39:35.400
They didn't
prosecute him.

39:35.600 --> 39:37.000
No, believe me,
they will get him for that.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
but they were surveilling him
on a different case.

39:40.800 --> 39:42.300
Horatio needs to see this.

39:50.900 --> 39:52.600
Looking for a little
alone time with me

39:52.700 --> 39:54.600
before I testify,
Sergeant?

39:54.600 --> 39:56.100
After you, Mr. LeBrock.

39:59.800 --> 40:01.900
Why am I not surprised?

40:02.200 --> 40:04.600
Here tstop me
from testifying
against your kid?

40:05.100 --> 40:07.500
You killed
Oscar Monahan, Joe.

40:07.700 --> 40:09.300
That's why
you're not surprised.

40:09.500 --> 40:12.400
But the smoking cell phone
was in your kid's hands.

40:12.700 --> 40:14.100
After you put it there.

40:16.900 --> 40:18.600
You like reality
television, Joe?

40:20.400 --> 40:21.900
Take a look at that.

40:23.200 --> 40:25.300
CAINE:
Recognize your son
behind the wheel?

40:33.500 --> 40:35.700
Boy, you're really scraping
the bottom of the barrel

40:35.700 --> 40:36.800
this time, Caine.

40:37.400 --> 40:39.400
How long did it take
you to rig that up?

40:39.700 --> 40:42.700
Joe, I don't think
I have to spell out to you

40:42.800 --> 40:44.900
what this means inside.

40:45.200 --> 40:48.000
You're going to pay
for your son's sins.

40:48.200 --> 40:49.500
Oh, don't worry about me.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.500
I can take care of myself.

40:55.900 --> 40:57.400
Now I'm late for court.

41:02.200 --> 41:04.000
Your Honor,
this cell phone was used

41:04.100 --> 41:05.900
to detonate
an explosive device

41:05.900 --> 41:07.900
which resulted
in Oscar Monahan's death.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.500
Did you sell this cell
phone to Kyle Harmon?

41:17.700 --> 41:19.200
It certainly looks familiar.

41:19.600 --> 41:22.800
Mr. LeBrock, can you identify
Kyle Harmon for the court?

41:36.400 --> 41:37.500
NEVINS:
Mr. LeBrock?

41:39.000 --> 41:41.100
Can you identify Kyle Harmon
for the court?

41:50.100 --> 41:51.200
I would...

41:53.300 --> 41:54.600
but I don't see him here.

41:56.200 --> 41:58.600
You said you sold
this phone to him.

41:59.200 --> 42:01.900
Yes, but I don't see
Kyle Harmon in this room.

42:02.200 --> 42:03.300
Is that not in fact

42:03.400 --> 42:04.600
Kyle Harmon?

42:06.800 --> 42:10.900
If that's Kyle Harmon,
who did I sell my phone to?

42:13.900 --> 42:15.000
NEVINS:
Mr. LeBrock,

42:15.000 --> 42:18.600
you stated you sold this phone
to Kyle Harmon.

42:20.300 --> 42:25.300
You know, I'm not even sure
I'd recognize that phone.

42:25.500 --> 42:27.400
That's enough, Miss Nevins.
Your Honor...

42:27.400 --> 42:29.200
We're done here.

42:30.200 --> 42:31.000
JUDGE:
The court finds that

42:31.100 --> 42:33.600
there's insufficient evidence
to Mr. Harmon to answer.

42:34.800 --> 42:35.800
Case dismissed.

42:42.300 --> 42:43.200
Horatio.

42:46.000 --> 42:46.900
Look at me.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.300
What did you in there?

42:49.400 --> 42:51.800
I was sparing Joe
some embarrassment.

42:51.900 --> 42:52.900
But it's okay
to embarrass me?

42:53.000 --> 42:55.400
I looked like a fool in there.
Rebecca...

42:56.300 --> 42:58.000
the boy is my son.
