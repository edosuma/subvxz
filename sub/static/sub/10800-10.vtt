WEBVTT

00:07.194 --> 00:11.358
It's been five months
since Marc's accident.

00:11.399 --> 00:14.425
I haven't missed
a single hour of my duties.

00:14.468 --> 00:17.596
I've volunteered
for extra time in the nursery.

00:17.638 --> 00:20.766
My language studies are better
than they've ever been.

00:20.808 --> 00:23.003
Somebody else
might have given in

00:23.044 --> 00:24.841
but, uh, I didn't.

00:24.879 --> 00:26.312
Given in to what?

00:26.347 --> 00:27.974
Death is a normal part of life.

00:28.015 --> 00:31.883
Maybe some of us are better
at facing that than others.

00:31.919 --> 00:35.582
Maybe some of us
aren't facing it at all.

00:35.623 --> 00:37.181
What do you mean?

00:37.224 --> 00:39.192
Recovery from a great loss

00:39.260 --> 00:41.353
involves a great deal of pain.

00:41.395 --> 00:43.022
If we try to avoid that pain

00:43.064 --> 00:46.295
we can make it harder
on ourselves in the long run.

00:46.334 --> 00:48.996
But I feel fine.

00:50.905 --> 00:54.534
Today would have been
your husband's 38th birthday.

00:56.243 --> 00:58.803
You keep excellent records,
Deanna.

01:01.315 --> 01:06.617
Last night, I dreamt Marc
was with me, celebrating.

01:06.654 --> 01:11.057
I was so glad that this nonsense
was finally over.

01:11.092 --> 01:13.652
Then I woke up

01:13.694 --> 01:16.322
alone...

01:16.364 --> 01:19.856
and I knew that he was dead.

01:21.469 --> 01:25.098
For the first time, I knew it.

01:25.139 --> 01:29.041
I looked around for anything
that belonged to him...

01:29.076 --> 01:32.512
anything.

01:32.546 --> 01:36.642
I forgot that after the funeral,
I told them to take it all away.

01:36.684 --> 01:39.380
What in the world
was I thinking?

01:41.000 --> 01:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:55.236 --> 01:58.296
They didn't take
everything away.

02:01.742 --> 02:03.505
How did you know?

02:19.026 --> 02:20.493
...an ancient trail

02:20.528 --> 02:23.827
along the Kabul River
in the Himalayas.

02:23.864 --> 02:25.126
It's a wonderful program.

02:25.166 --> 02:26.497
Will, it would do you good

02:26.534 --> 02:28.627
to have a little
fresh holodeck air.

02:28.669 --> 02:30.694
I think my horsemanship
is a little rusty

02:30.738 --> 02:32.831
for the Himalayas,
but thanks anyway.

02:32.873 --> 02:34.841
Nonsense.
We'd program

02:34.875 --> 02:37.309
an appropriately docile steed...

02:37.344 --> 02:39.175
Captain.

02:39.213 --> 02:42.307
Sensors indicate
a vast field of...

02:42.349 --> 02:44.647
Of what, Lieutenant?

02:44.685 --> 02:47.085
It's gone.

02:47.121 --> 02:50.056
But something did appear
directly in our path.

02:50.091 --> 02:51.956
Deflector shields
are not encountering

02:51.992 --> 02:53.926
elevated levels
of interstellar matter.

02:53.961 --> 02:55.519
A sensor echo, Data?

02:55.563 --> 02:56.825
Uncertain. I have

02:56.864 --> 02:59.128
no unusual readings, Commander.

02:59.166 --> 03:02.932
I promise I'll come by
and see you tomorrow.

03:02.970 --> 03:05.234
Deanna, are you all right?

03:05.272 --> 03:08.332
What? What?

03:08.375 --> 03:10.775
You faded out there
for a second.

03:10.811 --> 03:12.472
Oh, no.

03:12.513 --> 03:14.003
No, I'm fine.

03:14.048 --> 03:16.573
Um, I'm just very tired,
that's all.

03:16.617 --> 03:19.643
Will I see you tomorrow?

03:19.687 --> 03:22.281
Tomorrow.

03:22.323 --> 03:24.382
Thank you, Deanna.

03:29.997 --> 03:32.488
Oh...

03:32.533 --> 03:34.524
Oh!

03:40.508 --> 03:43.875
An aggregate field
of plane-polarized objects

03:43.911 --> 03:45.674
has just appeared.

03:45.713 --> 03:47.772
And disappeared.

03:50.284 --> 03:53.185
Recommend we run a diagnostic
on the forward sensor array.

03:53.220 --> 03:54.949
We don't want
a ghost tailing us

03:54.989 --> 03:56.354
all the way to T'lli Beta.

03:56.390 --> 03:58.858
I'm not convinced it is a ghost.

03:58.893 --> 04:01.191
There may be
something there, Commander.

04:01.228 --> 04:03.287
Ensign Allenby, full stop.

04:03.330 --> 04:04.627
Aye, sir.

04:04.665 --> 04:07.293
Let's investigate
both possibilities.

04:40.414 --> 04:45.374
Space, the final frontier.

04:45.419 --> 04:49.150
These are the voyages
of the Starship <i>Enterprise. </i>

04:49.190 --> 04:51.420
Its continuing mission...

04:51.459 --> 04:54.485
to explore strange new worlds

04:54.529 --> 04:59.592
to seek out new life
and new civilizations

04:59.634 --> 05:03.968
to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

06:00.294 --> 06:04.628
Captain's Log, Stardate 44356.9.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.792
Sensor diagnostics
have been completed

06:06.834 --> 06:09.530
and indicate
that all systems are normal.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.936
There remains no explanation
for the images

06:11.973 --> 06:13.702
which appeared in our path.

06:15.710 --> 06:18.975
I have completed another
full scan of the area, sir.

06:19.013 --> 06:22.107
There is no further
indication of the anomaly.

06:22.149 --> 06:25.277
Ensign, prepare to resume course
to T'lli Beta.

06:25.319 --> 06:28.482
Mr. Data, what velocity
would put us back on schedule?

06:28.522 --> 06:30.547
A resumption
of our present course

06:30.591 --> 06:32.081
at warp six will place us

06:32.126 --> 06:34.287
in the T'lli Beta
system in six days

06:34.328 --> 06:35.556
13 hours, 47 minutes.

06:35.596 --> 06:37.689
What? No seconds?

06:39.634 --> 06:42.467
I have discovered, sir,
a certain level of impatience

06:42.503 --> 06:44.630
when I calculate
a lengthy time interval

06:44.672 --> 06:46.264
to the nearest second.

06:46.307 --> 06:47.672
However, if you wish...

06:47.708 --> 06:50.074
No, no.
Minutes is fine.

06:50.111 --> 06:52.602
Stand ready at warp six, Ensign.

06:52.647 --> 06:54.137
Aye, sir.

06:54.248 --> 06:55.408
Engage.

06:58.886 --> 07:00.148
Riker to Engineering.

07:00.254 --> 07:01.744
Geordi, what the hell happened?

07:01.789 --> 07:03.256
Checking.

07:03.291 --> 07:07.091
Looks like the field collapsed
before we could enter warp.

07:07.194 --> 07:08.821
Recommend full stop
while I check it out.

07:08.863 --> 07:09.830
Back to all stop, Ensign.

07:09.864 --> 07:10.831
Aye, sir.

07:10.865 --> 07:11.854
All decks reporting.

07:11.899 --> 07:12.923
Minor injuries only, sir.

07:12.967 --> 07:13.934
Damage?

07:13.968 --> 07:14.935
None, sir.

07:14.969 --> 07:16.596
Weapons and shields normal.

07:16.637 --> 07:18.332
Go to Yellow Alert.

07:18.372 --> 07:20.397
Captain, we've started
moving again.

07:20.441 --> 07:22.705
Something is pulling us.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.949
Troi to Dr. Crusher.

07:39.994 --> 07:41.359
Yes, Deanna?

07:41.395 --> 07:42.555
Beverly...

07:42.596 --> 07:45.690
I'm feeling very dizzy.

07:45.733 --> 07:48.133
Did you hit your head?

07:48.235 --> 07:49.702
I'm not sure.

07:49.737 --> 07:52.137
I'm not sure what happened.

07:52.239 --> 07:54.298
Lie down, breathe deeply
and stay calm.

07:54.342 --> 07:56.503
I'm getting calls
from all over the ship.

07:56.544 --> 07:58.409
I'll be there
as quickly as I can.

08:02.016 --> 08:04.951
New heading confirmed:
025 mark 273.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.953
Speed is holding
at one-tenth impulse.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.581
Whatever is pulling us
sure isn't in a hurry.

08:09.623 --> 08:10.590
Picard to La Forge.

08:10.624 --> 08:11.591
Go ahead, Captain.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.183
Mr. La Forge, if your engines
are functioning

08:13.227 --> 08:14.524
we'll attempt to break free.

08:14.562 --> 08:16.928
Well, everything down here
seems normal enough, sir.

08:16.964 --> 08:19.091
But I suggest we take it
a bit slower this time.

08:19.200 --> 08:22.533
Ensign, bring us around
90 degrees to starboard.

08:22.570 --> 08:25.630
New course laid in
at 90 degrees to starboard.

08:25.673 --> 08:28.665
One-quarter impulse.
Engage.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.506
Aye, sir.

08:33.748 --> 08:35.875
Nothing, Captain.

08:35.916 --> 08:38.282
Speed and course are unaffected.

08:38.318 --> 08:40.719
One-half impulse.

08:45.226 --> 08:46.488
No change.

08:46.527 --> 08:48.119
Full impulse.

08:48.229 --> 08:51.096
Rotate heading
in five-degree increments.

08:51.132 --> 08:53.225
Aye, sir.

08:56.404 --> 08:57.769
La Forge?

08:57.805 --> 09:00.137
There's nothing wrong down here.

09:00.241 --> 09:02.300
The engines are fine.

09:02.343 --> 09:05.642
Integrity field stress exceeding
82 million kilodynes.

09:05.679 --> 09:07.647
Recommend immediate
shutdown, sir.

09:07.681 --> 09:10.377
Make it so, Ensign.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.620
All engines down.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.590
We're still being pulled.

09:17.625 --> 09:20.389
Same heading, same speed.

09:25.099 --> 09:28.000
I got here
as quickly as I could.

09:28.035 --> 09:30.629
I've got a Sick Bay
filled with headaches.

09:30.671 --> 09:31.729
How are you?

09:31.772 --> 09:33.831
Well, when I first called you

09:33.874 --> 09:36.104
I was feeling intense pain.

09:36.210 --> 09:37.871
Now it's gone

09:37.912 --> 09:39.846
but I'm feeling a bit foggy.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.848
I'd like to take you
to Sick Bay and run

09:41.882 --> 09:44.373
an inner nuncial series on you.
Can you walk?

09:44.418 --> 09:47.649
All senior staff report
to the observation lounge.

09:47.688 --> 09:48.985
Are you up to that?

09:49.023 --> 09:50.354
I think so.

09:54.328 --> 09:56.853
What is it?

09:56.897 --> 09:58.262
Nothing.

09:58.299 --> 09:59.425
Nothing. I'm fine.

10:10.311 --> 10:13.144
Could it be some sort
of tractor beam?

10:13.247 --> 10:15.909
No other ship is indicated.

10:18.252 --> 10:20.914
Mr. Worf, what is your analysis?

10:20.955 --> 10:22.889
Tactical sensor readings
are indeterminate.

10:22.923 --> 10:25.892
They don't even give us enough
for an educated guess.

10:25.926 --> 10:28.724
And yet all of our sensors
are operating properly.

10:28.762 --> 10:32.858
Can there be an intelligence
at work here?

10:32.900 --> 10:36.131
Counselor, do you sense
a life-form out there?

10:36.170 --> 10:38.001
No, I don't think so.

10:39.980 --> 10:40.947
No.

10:40.981 --> 10:42.778
There's nothing.

10:42.816 --> 10:45.080
Nothing.

10:45.119 --> 10:47.485
I sense nothing.

10:47.521 --> 10:49.011
It's all right, Counselor.

10:49.056 --> 10:52.048
Perhaps there's nothing
out there to sense.

10:52.092 --> 10:54.253
Indeed, there are many races

10:54.294 --> 10:56.455
that are not empathically
detectable.

10:56.497 --> 10:58.829
The Breen, the Ferengi...

10:58.866 --> 11:01.858
No, you don't understand.

11:01.902 --> 11:05.065
I don't sense anything

11:05.139 --> 11:08.336
not out there, not in here.

11:10.010 --> 11:12.035
All of you

11:12.079 --> 11:14.673
you're all blank to me.

11:20.954 --> 11:23.218
There's no indication
of a concussion

11:23.257 --> 11:24.781
or a blow to the head.

11:24.825 --> 11:27.350
Just a pattern
of unresponsive neural cells

11:27.394 --> 11:30.090
throughout the cerebellum
and cerebral cortex.

11:30.164 --> 11:31.654
Unresponsive?

11:31.698 --> 11:33.666
There's brain damage.

11:33.700 --> 11:35.964
How serious, I can't tell yet.

11:36.003 --> 11:39.700
But I feel perfectly fine
otherwise.

11:39.740 --> 11:41.503
Can you treat it?

11:41.542 --> 11:43.009
I'm not sure.

11:43.043 --> 11:47.309
I have to review the database
on Betazoid neural physiology.

11:47.347 --> 11:48.814
The Betazoid brain

11:48.849 --> 11:51.249
has a remarkable ability
to heal itself.

11:51.285 --> 11:54.220
This condition could just
reverse itself in time.

11:54.254 --> 11:56.882
It might, but you
are half-human.

11:56.924 --> 11:58.721
That changes the map a little.

11:58.759 --> 12:02.354
I don't want to offer
you any false hopes.

12:02.396 --> 12:05.695
It's just hope, Beverly,
not false hope.

12:05.732 --> 12:07.359
What would cause
something like this?

12:07.401 --> 12:08.925
Because it started
at the same time

12:08.969 --> 12:10.402
that we encountered
the anomaly.

12:10.437 --> 12:13.065
There may be a connection.
I don't know.

12:13.140 --> 12:16.371
If you were anyone else,
you know the first thing I'd do?

12:16.410 --> 12:18.310
I'd send you to Counselor Troi.

12:18.345 --> 12:21.712
Well, then I have
an advantage, don't I?

12:21.748 --> 12:24.876
I see her quite often.

12:24.918 --> 12:26.215
Deanna, it's no different

12:26.253 --> 12:28.084
than one of us
suddenly going blind.

12:28.155 --> 12:29.782
You don't have
to tell me, Beverly.

12:29.823 --> 12:31.552
I understand the psychology.

12:31.592 --> 12:32.616
You may understand it

12:32.659 --> 12:34.354
but you've never had
to live with it.

12:34.394 --> 12:36.328
I may be perfectly
fine tomorrow.

12:36.363 --> 12:39.423
And you may not.

12:39.466 --> 12:40.956
Now, I'll do my homework.

12:41.001 --> 12:43.993
I'll see what I can do
to regenerate those cells

12:44.037 --> 12:47.336
but in the meantime, I want
you to talk with someone.

12:47.374 --> 12:51.105
There are several people onboard
who have degrees in psychology

12:51.211 --> 12:52.974
who are qualified therapists.

12:53.013 --> 12:54.913
Okay. Fine.

12:54.948 --> 12:56.415
If I need to.

12:56.450 --> 12:58.315
Right now, I just want
to go back to work.

12:58.352 --> 12:59.876
Deanna...

12:59.920 --> 13:03.447
If there are
no medical objections?

13:03.490 --> 13:06.482
No medical objections.

13:06.526 --> 13:07.857
Thank you, Beverly.

13:07.895 --> 13:09.123
Will.

13:24.344 --> 13:26.005
Come in.

13:29.950 --> 13:32.180
I don't have a psychology degree

13:32.219 --> 13:34.187
but if you'd like to talk...

13:36.323 --> 13:39.451
You know what the worst part
of this is?

13:39.493 --> 13:41.723
And I've seen it happen
to so many patients.

13:41.762 --> 13:43.627
What?

13:43.664 --> 13:47.065
The way other people change.

13:47.100 --> 13:50.126
How they start
to treat you differently.

13:53.206 --> 13:56.972
They walk on eggshells
around you.

13:57.010 --> 14:00.468
Sometimes
they avoid you altogether.

14:00.514 --> 14:02.914
Sometimes
they become overbearing...

14:02.950 --> 14:06.579
reach out a helping hand
to the blind woman.

14:06.620 --> 14:07.917
I'm sorry if I...

14:07.955 --> 14:09.650
I will not be treated that way!

14:09.690 --> 14:11.214
Hey!

14:11.258 --> 14:13.226
<i>Imzadi. </i>

14:13.260 --> 14:15.592
Oh, please.

14:15.629 --> 14:17.620
Deanna

14:17.664 --> 14:20.258
I've never seen you
quite so scared.

14:20.300 --> 14:22.063
I'm fine.

14:22.135 --> 14:24.399
If I get better, I get better.

14:24.438 --> 14:27.168
If I don't, I'll adapt.

14:27.207 --> 14:29.402
Life goes on.

14:34.481 --> 14:36.210
Deanna.

14:38.151 --> 14:40.085
I really have to finish this.

14:40.153 --> 14:43.088
I have some appointments
this afternoon.

14:55.102 --> 14:58.299
Probe launch successful.

14:58.338 --> 15:00.738
Telemetry transmissions
are being received.

15:00.774 --> 15:03.971
Okay, let's see what we've got.

15:04.011 --> 15:06.241
Nothing unusual here.

15:06.279 --> 15:08.008
Same reading
as the ship's sensors.

15:08.048 --> 15:09.913
Expanding analysis parameters.

15:09.950 --> 15:13.317
Including Bayesian functions...

15:15.222 --> 15:18.714
broad EM
and subspace spectrum polling.

15:18.759 --> 15:21.284
Hmm-mm.
No change.

15:21.328 --> 15:25.389
I am adding
virtual particle trajectories.

15:26.867 --> 15:28.732
Whoa.

15:30.270 --> 15:32.932
What is that?

15:32.973 --> 15:34.497
Unknown.

15:34.541 --> 15:39.171
I am attempting to analyze
motion pattern.

15:39.212 --> 15:42.704
Results still inconclusive.

15:42.749 --> 15:45.274
Last time I saw anything
that looked like that

15:45.318 --> 15:49.220
I was skin-diving
off the coral reefs at Bracas V.

15:49.256 --> 15:52.714
You said you woke up
a new woman this morning.

15:52.759 --> 15:54.488
That's how I feel.

15:54.528 --> 15:57.622
Tell me about her,
this new woman.

15:57.664 --> 16:01.566
She's, uh, not holding
anything back anymore.

16:01.601 --> 16:02.898
She's not?

16:02.936 --> 16:05.632
Oh, I let it all out last night.

16:05.672 --> 16:07.731
I cried for two hours.

16:07.774 --> 16:10.140
I realized
that I had never accepted

16:10.177 --> 16:11.735
the loss of my husband.

16:11.778 --> 16:14.406
I worked hard, I kept busy.

16:14.448 --> 16:18.248
I did everything to pretend
it never happened.

16:18.285 --> 16:20.048
And you feel different now?

16:20.120 --> 16:22.384
Completely.

16:24.558 --> 16:27.322
Can I share something
important with you?

16:27.360 --> 16:29.294
Of course.

16:29.329 --> 16:32.924
I've temporarily lost
my empathic sense.

16:32.966 --> 16:37.596
It's kind of like having
one hand tied behind your back.

16:37.637 --> 16:40.731
I'm so sorry.

16:40.774 --> 16:42.742
Do you want me to come back?

16:42.776 --> 16:44.767
No, no, I'm fine.

16:44.811 --> 16:47.371
It's just...
I feel before we continue

16:47.414 --> 16:50.315
it's important
that you know that, okay?

16:50.350 --> 16:53.012
All right.

16:53.053 --> 16:56.819
Because I can't tell
how you're feeling this morning.

16:56.857 --> 16:59.883
But it seems to me
that one night of crying

16:59.926 --> 17:02.326
can't make up
for months of denial.

17:02.362 --> 17:04.387
No, you're wrong.

17:04.431 --> 17:07.798
I feel better today
than I have in ages.

17:07.834 --> 17:10.496
You're absolutely wrong, Deanna.

17:18.036 --> 17:21.403
The probe's point of view
reveals that the objects exist

17:21.439 --> 17:24.407
entirely in two dimensions
on a single plane.

17:24.442 --> 17:27.536
They have length and width,
but not height.

17:27.578 --> 17:28.909
Virtually flat.

17:28.947 --> 17:31.177
That is why
the ship's forward sensors

17:31.215 --> 17:32.978
did not detect them initially.

17:33.017 --> 17:35.417
We were looking at them
along their edge.

17:35.453 --> 17:38.320
There was no surface to read.
I will illustrate.

17:57.742 --> 18:00.210
Are they a life-form?

18:00.244 --> 18:02.712
The movement pattern
within the cluster

18:02.747 --> 18:05.272
is not a naturally
occurring phenomenon

18:05.316 --> 18:07.181
in the Newtonian sense.

18:07.218 --> 18:09.015
They appear to be alive.

18:09.053 --> 18:12.580
Can you explain why they're
pulling us along with them?

18:12.623 --> 18:14.318
Somehow they're able to polarize

18:14.359 --> 18:16.486
the graviton field
as they move about.

18:16.527 --> 18:18.427
We're caught in the wake.

18:18.463 --> 18:19.930
How do we get out of it?

18:19.964 --> 18:21.591
The best idea for now is to try

18:21.632 --> 18:23.827
a controlled overload
of the warp drive.

18:23.868 --> 18:25.495
Jump directly to warp six.

18:25.536 --> 18:28.164
The laws of a three-dimensional
universe say it should work.

18:28.206 --> 18:30.572
Don't know about a two-
dimensional universe, though.

18:36.948 --> 18:38.916
Fascinating.

18:38.950 --> 18:41.418
So many questions.

18:41.452 --> 18:44.512
How can a two-dimensional
entity have access

18:44.555 --> 18:46.785
to a three-dimensional
universe?

18:46.824 --> 18:48.951
And are they aware of us?

18:50.862 --> 18:53.296
Number One, if we can
put off the T'lli Betans

18:53.331 --> 18:55.458
I would like
to investigate this further

18:55.500 --> 18:57.900
as soon as we are free
of the graviton field.

18:57.935 --> 19:00.836
It's a shame we can't tell
if they're sentient.

19:00.872 --> 19:02.999
What do you mean by that?

19:04.776 --> 19:07.677
I'm doing the best that I can.

19:07.712 --> 19:09.873
No one suggested otherwise,
Counselor.

19:11.682 --> 19:13.547
Mr. Data, try to isolate

19:13.584 --> 19:15.017
any signal patterns
from the cluster.

19:15.053 --> 19:16.850
Perhaps there'll be
a basis for communication.

19:16.888 --> 19:18.515
Mr. La Forge, we'll
attempt your warp jump

19:18.556 --> 19:19.648
as soon as you're prepared.

19:19.690 --> 19:20.782
That will be all.

19:22.593 --> 19:24.390
Counselor...

19:35.606 --> 19:37.233
How are you feeling?

19:37.275 --> 19:38.902
Beverly, I can't do my job.

19:38.943 --> 19:40.410
I'm absolutely lost.

19:40.445 --> 19:42.413
You have to do something.

19:42.447 --> 19:44.711
I cross-referenced
your scan results

19:44.749 --> 19:47.309
with the baseline files
in the computer.

19:47.351 --> 19:49.251
Nothing helpful has turned up.

19:49.287 --> 19:51.812
And so far,
the lab work is inconclusive.

19:51.856 --> 19:54.051
Inconclusive?
What does that mean?

19:54.125 --> 19:57.424
It means there is nothing
I can do now.

19:57.462 --> 19:59.054
I am still trying.

19:59.130 --> 20:01.598
How do you people
live like this?

20:01.632 --> 20:07.696
We get by pretty well, actually,
and so will you, in time.

20:07.738 --> 20:10.901
You have no idea... no idea...
what this is like.

20:10.942 --> 20:14.070
How can you know what it's like
to lose something you never had?

20:14.178 --> 20:15.645
I don't claim to.

20:15.680 --> 20:17.204
And yet you're telling me

20:17.248 --> 20:19.409
that I'm supposed
to get used to it.

20:19.450 --> 20:22.078
If our positions were reversed,
what would you tell me?

20:22.186 --> 20:23.949
If our positions were reversed

20:23.988 --> 20:27.082
I wouldn't have been in here
treating skinned elbows

20:27.158 --> 20:30.389
while you were lying passed out
on your office floor.

20:30.428 --> 20:32.328
I'd have been there a lot sooner

20:32.363 --> 20:35.560
perhaps in time to prevent this
from ever happening!

21:14.071 --> 21:16.062
I've been working
with Ensign Brooks

21:16.107 --> 21:18.473
since the death of her husband.

21:18.509 --> 21:21.842
She's avoided the reality
of what happened

21:21.879 --> 21:23.574
denied it to herself.

21:23.614 --> 21:25.582
And I realize I've been doing

21:25.616 --> 21:27.982
the same thing
about my condition.

21:28.019 --> 21:30.078
It's perfectly understandable.

21:30.188 --> 21:33.680
It's time I accept
the truth, Captain

21:33.724 --> 21:36.522
and resign as Ship's Counselor.

21:36.561 --> 21:37.892
Resign?

21:37.929 --> 21:40.090
I can no longer fulfill
my obligations.

21:40.131 --> 21:41.928
What other option is there?

21:50.608 --> 21:52.599
Deanna...

21:54.612 --> 21:56.102
I've been fortunate

21:56.147 --> 21:59.583
to have access
to your Betazoid abilities.

21:59.617 --> 22:01.244
Most starship Captains

22:01.285 --> 22:04.686
have to be content
with a human Counselor.

22:04.722 --> 22:06.189
Empathic awareness

22:06.224 --> 22:09.193
is not a requirement
of your position.

22:09.227 --> 22:10.524
It is for me.

22:10.561 --> 22:13.962
I'm sure that, after a while,
you'll be able to adjust.

22:13.998 --> 22:16.023
They say when one loses a sense

22:16.067 --> 22:18.592
the other senses become stronger
to compensate.

22:18.636 --> 22:22.037
A blind man develops
better hearing...

22:22.073 --> 22:23.540
With all due respect, Captain

22:23.574 --> 22:26.202
you don't know
what you're talking about.

22:26.244 --> 22:30.203
That is a common belief
with no scientific basis

22:30.248 --> 22:32.876
no doubt created
by normal people

22:32.917 --> 22:36.409
who felt uncomfortable
around the disabled.

22:36.454 --> 22:38.718
I am disabled

22:38.756 --> 22:41.691
and I'm telling you
I cannot perform my duties.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.625
There was a teacher
of mine at the Academy

22:51.669 --> 22:54.433
who had been confined
to a wheelchair from birth.

22:54.472 --> 22:55.734
She was a woman...

22:55.773 --> 22:59.709
Captain, spare me
the inspirational anecdote

22:59.744 --> 23:03.976
and just accept my resignation.

23:21.065 --> 23:23.397
Come in.

23:28.339 --> 23:31.308
I really would rather
be alone right now.

23:32.777 --> 23:34.574
Too bad.

23:49.694 --> 23:52.686
Shh...

23:57.201 --> 24:00.796
Is this how you handle
all your personnel problems?

24:00.838 --> 24:02.328
Sure.

24:02.373 --> 24:04.000
You'd be surprised

24:04.041 --> 24:06.236
how far a hug goes
with Geordi or Worf.

24:08.879 --> 24:10.471
Will...

24:10.514 --> 24:13.381
I don't know what to do.

24:17.755 --> 24:20.155
So, you resign?

24:20.191 --> 24:23.683
You walk away from all the
people who care about you?

24:27.199 --> 24:30.726
I look around me,
and all I see

24:30.769 --> 24:34.034
are surfaces without depth...

24:34.139 --> 24:37.506
colorless, hollow.

24:37.543 --> 24:40.034
Nothing seems real.

24:40.079 --> 24:41.273
I'm real.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.838
No, you're not.

24:43.882 --> 24:45.406
You're a projection

24:45.451 --> 24:47.681
with no more substance
to me

24:47.720 --> 24:50.188
than a character
on the holodeck.

24:50.222 --> 24:53.020
I don't believe that.

24:53.058 --> 24:57.688
You have no idea
how frightening it is

24:57.730 --> 25:01.962
to... to just be here,
without sensing you

25:02.001 --> 25:04.697
without sharing your feelings.

25:10.175 --> 25:12.166
That's it, isn't it?

25:13.946 --> 25:15.914
We're on equal footing now.

25:15.948 --> 25:17.313
What?

25:17.349 --> 25:20.113
You always had an advantage...

25:20.152 --> 25:22.382
a little bit of control
of every situation.

25:22.421 --> 25:25.117
That must have been
a very safe position to be in.

25:27.826 --> 25:31.023
To be honest...

25:31.096 --> 25:34.259
I'd always thought there was
something a little too...

25:34.299 --> 25:37.166
aristocratic about
your Betazoid heritage.

25:37.202 --> 25:40.660
As if your human side wasn't
quite good enough for you.

25:40.706 --> 25:42.606
That isn't true.

25:42.641 --> 25:44.700
Isn't it?

25:44.743 --> 25:47.177
La Forge to Riker.

25:47.212 --> 25:48.736
Go ahead, Geordi.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.644
We are ready to attempt

25:51.684 --> 25:53.879
a controlled overload jump
to warp six.

25:53.919 --> 25:56.444
Acknowledged.
I'm on my way to the Bridge.

26:00.225 --> 26:02.819
I'll check in on you later.

26:02.861 --> 26:05.193
Really, you don't have to.

26:07.166 --> 26:09.964
I will check in on you later.

26:27.186 --> 26:30.155
Setting new course
at optimal shearing angle...

26:30.189 --> 26:32.987
bearing 217 mark 203.

26:33.025 --> 26:36.017
Engaging impulse engines now.

26:38.030 --> 26:40.328
Mr. La Forge, go to warp.

26:40.365 --> 26:42.629
Aye, sir.

26:42.668 --> 26:43.965
Status?

26:44.002 --> 26:45.492
Unchanged.

26:45.537 --> 26:47.869
We have not broken free
of the graviton field.

26:51.376 --> 26:52.673
Warning.

26:52.711 --> 26:54.679
Differential stress
will exceed upper limit

26:54.713 --> 26:56.305
in 15 seconds.

26:56.348 --> 26:58.043
Disengage all engines.

26:58.083 --> 27:00.779
Warning. Differential stress
will exceed upper...

27:02.321 --> 27:04.084
Engines disengaged, sir.

27:04.123 --> 27:05.613
Report, La Forge.

27:05.657 --> 27:08.421
The energy we wanted
to transfer to the nacelles

27:08.460 --> 27:10.451
was absorbed
by the graviton wake instead.

27:10.496 --> 27:13.294
It set up a torsional wave
that rebounded back to the ship.

27:13.332 --> 27:15.800
We're lucky the hull
is still in one piece.

27:15.834 --> 27:17.927
This little nuisance
is beginning

27:17.970 --> 27:19.562
to lose its fascination.

27:19.605 --> 27:21.266
Sir, during our attempt
to break away

27:21.306 --> 27:22.796
I recorded
a momentary alteration

27:22.841 --> 27:24.809
in the movement pattern
within the cluster.

27:24.843 --> 27:27.141
Do you think we got
their attention, Data?

27:27.179 --> 27:29.306
Perhaps,
but just for an instant.

27:29.348 --> 27:33.148
The pattern immediately returned
to its previous dynamic.

27:34.486 --> 27:37.478
Follow up on it, Mr. Data.

27:37.523 --> 27:40.492
Input your observations
into the universal translator.

27:40.526 --> 27:41.515
Aye, sir.

27:41.560 --> 27:42.993
Perhaps these movements,
themselves

27:43.028 --> 27:45.360
are an attempt at communication.

27:58.210 --> 27:59.541
More tea?

27:59.578 --> 28:01.512
I didn't mean to startle you.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.243
That's all right.

28:04.283 --> 28:06.274
I'm getting used to it.

28:06.318 --> 28:07.444
May I?

28:07.486 --> 28:09.477
Sure.

28:14.126 --> 28:16.492
Are you really
getting used to it?

28:18.997 --> 28:20.965
No.

28:20.999 --> 28:22.967
Do you want to talk about it?

28:23.001 --> 28:23.968
No.

28:24.002 --> 28:25.492
Good.

28:25.537 --> 28:28.973
I get so tired of people
coming in with their problems.

28:29.007 --> 28:31.134
They come in, they want
a shoulder to cry on

28:31.176 --> 28:33.167
and generally,
it turns out to be mine.

28:33.212 --> 28:36.375
You'd make a good Counselor.

28:36.415 --> 28:37.814
I think so, too

28:37.850 --> 28:40.717
so I'm going to talk
to Picard about it.

28:40.752 --> 28:43.152
About what?

28:43.188 --> 28:45.281
You becoming Counselor?

28:45.324 --> 28:47.155
Well, yes. You're leaving.

28:47.192 --> 28:50.491
That means there won't
be a Counselor onboard

28:50.529 --> 28:54.397
and I suppose I'll have
a very long line at that bar.

28:54.433 --> 28:57.561
It would be nice to have
a nice office, too.

28:57.603 --> 29:03.337
It's more than just letting them
cry on your shoulder.

29:03.375 --> 29:05.900
It takes an enormous commitment.

29:05.944 --> 29:08.174
I can do that.

29:08.213 --> 29:10.773
Guinan, people come
to talk to you

29:10.816 --> 29:13.284
about things they want
to reveal.

29:13.318 --> 29:15.081
As Ship's Counselor

29:15.120 --> 29:18.886
you have to get them
to talk about things

29:18.924 --> 29:20.448
they don't want to reveal.

29:20.492 --> 29:22.153
I could do that, too.

29:22.194 --> 29:24.492
What are you...?

29:26.498 --> 29:29.990
You don't really want
to be Ship's Counselor.

29:30.068 --> 29:32.002
What would make you say that?

29:32.070 --> 29:34.538
I just know you're not serious.

29:34.573 --> 29:38.805
Have I given you any indication
that I might not be serious?

29:38.844 --> 29:40.675
Not really, but...

29:40.712 --> 29:42.509
Then how do you know?

29:42.547 --> 29:45.345
Are your empathic abilities
coming back?

29:45.384 --> 29:48.182
No.

29:48.220 --> 29:51.678
I suppose it's just instinctive.

29:51.723 --> 29:54.191
Oh.

29:54.226 --> 29:55.989
I get it.

29:56.028 --> 29:57.825
You're trying to make me see

29:57.863 --> 30:00.923
that I have other abilities
to draw on...

30:00.966 --> 30:05.130
human intuition, instincts.

30:05.170 --> 30:08.833
Guinan, those skills
only develop

30:08.874 --> 30:11.035
after years of experience.

30:12.711 --> 30:14.576
It's not that easy.

30:14.613 --> 30:17.013
No one said it was easy.

30:17.049 --> 30:20.018
It's much harder than you think.

30:20.052 --> 30:24.989
Human intuition and instinct
are not always right

30:25.023 --> 30:28.481
but they do make
life interesting.

30:31.063 --> 30:33.827
So I'm discovering.

30:48.313 --> 30:49.541
Problem, Data?

30:49.581 --> 30:50.878
Yes, Commander.

30:50.916 --> 30:52.383
Sensors are detecting

30:52.417 --> 30:55.215
highly-accelerated
interstellar gases.

30:55.253 --> 30:56.379
Suggesting?

30:56.421 --> 30:57.547
Uncertain, sir.

30:57.589 --> 31:00.057
The phenomenon
is within visual range.

31:00.092 --> 31:01.753
On screen.

31:01.793 --> 31:03.886
Magnify.

31:06.098 --> 31:08.692
It appears to be
a cosmic string fragment

31:08.734 --> 31:12.363
only 107 kilometers long.

31:12.404 --> 31:14.804
A cosmic string?

31:14.840 --> 31:16.307
No wider than a proton

31:16.341 --> 31:19.037
but with gravitational fields
as powerful as a black hole.

31:19.111 --> 31:21.238
The two-dimensional beings
seem to be caught

31:21.279 --> 31:23.144
in the gravitational pull
of the string

31:23.181 --> 31:26.048
Their course is taking
them directly toward it.

31:26.151 --> 31:29.052
And us right along with it.

31:34.726 --> 31:38.628
Captain's Log, Stardate 44359.5.

31:38.663 --> 31:41.063
What began
as a curious inconvenience

31:41.133 --> 31:43.328
has turned
into a serious threat.

31:43.368 --> 31:45.734
At current speed,
the two-dimensional beings

31:45.771 --> 31:47.898
and the <i>Enterprise</i>
will be drawn into

31:47.939 --> 31:50.339
the cosmic string fragment
in seven hours.

31:51.777 --> 31:53.677
The entities offer no indication

31:53.712 --> 31:55.737
they are aware
of the string fragment, sir.

31:55.781 --> 31:58.011
Their course and speed
remain constant.

31:58.050 --> 31:59.415
Sir, I recommend we fire

31:59.451 --> 32:02.079
a spread of photon torpedoes
into their field.

32:06.058 --> 32:09.027
Must we destroy them
to save ourselves?

32:09.094 --> 32:12.655
It is unclear what effect
a photon torpedo would have

32:12.697 --> 32:14.591
on two-dimensional beings, sir.

32:14.724 --> 32:16.021
Nevertheless...

32:16.092 --> 32:18.788
Well, we wouldn't necessarily
have to fire at them.

32:18.828 --> 32:21.991
Half a dozen photon torpedo
bursts directly in their path

32:22.031 --> 32:24.192
could make them change course.

32:24.234 --> 32:26.225
Make it so.

32:28.071 --> 32:29.197
Torpedoes armed.

32:29.239 --> 32:31.230
Fire distribution set.

32:31.274 --> 32:34.266
Detonation at seven kilometers
ahead of the cluster.

32:34.310 --> 32:35.641
Data, launch another probe.

32:35.678 --> 32:38.146
Patch the monitor through
to the main viewer.

32:38.181 --> 32:39.648
Probe is launched.

32:39.682 --> 32:40.876
On screen.

32:46.055 --> 32:47.716
Proceed, Mr. Worf.

32:47.757 --> 32:49.281
Launching torpedoes.

32:49.325 --> 32:52.317
Detonation in five seconds.

32:52.362 --> 32:55.456
Three... two... one.

32:58.334 --> 33:00.802
There is no change
in the graviton field.

33:00.837 --> 33:04.364
The torpedoes are having
no effect, sir.

33:06.609 --> 33:11.706
Fire another volley directly
into their field, Mr. Worf.

33:14.551 --> 33:16.985
Launching torpedoes.

33:17.020 --> 33:18.885
Detonation in five seconds.

33:18.922 --> 33:22.483
Three... two... one.

33:25.395 --> 33:30.560
Matter-antimatter explosions
appear to be ineffective, sir.

33:48.284 --> 33:49.751
Come in.

33:52.188 --> 33:53.917
Janet.

33:53.957 --> 33:55.219
Oh, I'm sorry.

33:55.258 --> 33:57.055
I meant to cancel
your appointment today.

33:57.093 --> 34:00.893
Actually, I'm resigning
as Ship's Counselor.

34:00.930 --> 34:02.727
Why?

34:02.765 --> 34:06.701
I think it was fairly clear
during your last appointment.

34:06.736 --> 34:09.000
It was obviously non-productive.

34:09.038 --> 34:11.734
I couldn't sense
what you were feeling.

34:11.774 --> 34:15.766
Deanna, you were right about me.

34:15.812 --> 34:19.270
I had to go back
and look at what I was doing

34:19.315 --> 34:22.876
see why I was trying
to convince myself and you

34:22.918 --> 34:24.147
that I was a new woman.

34:24.187 --> 34:25.518
You made me realize

34:25.554 --> 34:28.683
I was doing exactly
the same thing to myself

34:28.725 --> 34:30.351
as I was before...

34:30.393 --> 34:32.224
trying to hide from the pain.

34:32.261 --> 34:37.960
Maybe you couldn't sense
what I was feeling

34:38.001 --> 34:40.561
but you helped.

34:46.743 --> 34:48.210
Come.

34:51.581 --> 34:53.742
You wanted to see me, Captain.

34:53.783 --> 34:55.045
Yes, Counselor.

34:55.118 --> 34:56.608
Sit down, please.

35:01.824 --> 35:03.985
Our situation
has become critical.

35:04.060 --> 35:06.995
The cluster remains
completely unresponsive.

35:07.063 --> 35:09.827
We have not been able
to alter its course

35:09.866 --> 35:12.232
towards the cosmic
string fragment.

35:12.268 --> 35:14.736
How much time do we have?

35:14.771 --> 35:16.830
Less than five hours.

35:16.873 --> 35:19.740
Which is why I have called you.

35:19.776 --> 35:21.243
Sir?

35:21.277 --> 35:22.744
All that remains

35:22.779 --> 35:25.213
is the possibility
of communication.

35:25.248 --> 35:26.806
There might be some way

35:26.849 --> 35:30.512
that we can warn them
of their impending destruction.

35:32.689 --> 35:35.351
I thought Data had already tried
to establish communications

35:35.391 --> 35:37.484
through
the universal translator.

35:37.527 --> 35:39.324
He has tried
every technical means

35:39.362 --> 35:41.159
at our disposal to reach them.

35:42.765 --> 35:44.460
I wish I knew how to help,
Captain

35:44.500 --> 35:46.161
but under the circumstances...

35:46.202 --> 35:48.727
If there is a psychology
to these creatures

35:48.771 --> 35:50.238
we must discover it.

35:50.273 --> 35:52.901
If there is an explanation
for their behavior

35:52.942 --> 35:55.172
we must know what it is.

35:55.211 --> 35:56.678
Even in your current condition

35:56.713 --> 35:58.647
you are
the most qualified person

35:58.681 --> 36:00.774
aboard this ship to assist.

36:00.817 --> 36:01.943
Data is in observation

36:01.984 --> 36:03.747
attempting to formulate
a strategy.

36:03.786 --> 36:05.048
I want you to join him.

36:09.826 --> 36:11.521
Deanna

36:11.561 --> 36:15.053
we need you.

36:23.005 --> 36:24.734
Captain's Log, supplemental.

36:24.774 --> 36:27.004
If our speed
and course remain unchanged

36:27.110 --> 36:29.704
in one hour, the <i>Enterprise</i>
will be torn apart

36:29.746 --> 36:33.011
by the gravitational forces
of the cosmic string fragment.

36:36.686 --> 36:39.314
Are your signals reaching them?

36:39.355 --> 36:40.515
Possibly.

36:40.556 --> 36:42.285
However, the beings may
perceive them

36:42.325 --> 36:45.817
as negligible noise, rather than
an attempt at communication.

36:45.862 --> 36:49.320
Is there any evidence at all
that they're sentient?

36:49.365 --> 36:51.799
Negative. The nature
of their movements

36:51.834 --> 36:54.394
suggests a simple order
of intelligence.

36:58.241 --> 37:00.038
I'm sorry, Data.

37:00.109 --> 37:04.136
I don't seem to be much help
without my empathic abilities.

37:04.180 --> 37:08.742
I just don't know how to draw
on my human instinct.

37:08.785 --> 37:12.221
As I do not have
human instinct, per se

37:12.255 --> 37:14.485
I cannot advise you, Counselor.

37:16.592 --> 37:18.649
Right now

37:18.782 --> 37:23.276
I feel as two-dimensional
as our friends out there.

37:23.320 --> 37:28.519
In the universe,
but barely aware of it.

37:28.559 --> 37:31.426
Just trying to survive...

37:33.363 --> 37:35.661
on instinct.

37:38.068 --> 37:39.968
Data...

37:40.003 --> 37:43.803
what if they're simply
acting instinctively?

37:43.840 --> 37:46.206
There are inherent

37:46.243 --> 37:49.804
inborn forces in every species.

37:49.846 --> 37:53.976
What they need, what they fear.

37:54.017 --> 37:58.078
We have to discover
what drives this species.

37:58.121 --> 38:00.180
I do not believe
there is any way

38:00.223 --> 38:02.418
we can know
for certain, Counselor.

38:02.459 --> 38:05.690
We can speculate
on the available evidence.

38:05.729 --> 38:07.526
The only evidence
we have at present

38:07.564 --> 38:10.124
is the brief interruption
in their movement pattern

38:10.167 --> 38:12.101
during our last attempt
to break away.

38:12.135 --> 38:15.696
Which may suggest some kind
of awareness of our presence.

38:15.739 --> 38:20.369
Otherwise, their course
and speed have been constant.

38:21.645 --> 38:25.479
On a straight line
to the cosmic string.

38:25.515 --> 38:28.951
You're convinced the string's
gravitation is pulling them in?

38:28.986 --> 38:31.079
Because the cluster
is two-dimensional

38:31.121 --> 38:33.112
I do not have
enough direct evidence

38:33.156 --> 38:34.714
to support that assumption.

38:34.758 --> 38:40.060
However, it is the most
reasonable hypothesis.

38:40.097 --> 38:41.530
Why?

38:41.565 --> 38:43.624
It is unlikely
they would intentionally move

38:43.667 --> 38:44.964
toward a destructive force.

38:45.002 --> 38:48.335
Moths fly toward a flame.

38:48.372 --> 38:51.899
Horses sometimes run
into a burning barn.

38:51.942 --> 38:53.432
Data, don't you see?

38:53.477 --> 38:56.640
We've been thinking
in three dimensions.

38:56.680 --> 38:59.148
We have to get two-dimensional.

39:00.517 --> 39:02.075
Pardon me?

39:02.119 --> 39:05.020
Subspace signals,
photon torpedoes...

39:05.055 --> 39:07.080
nothing's had an impact.

39:07.124 --> 39:10.355
It's reasonable to wonder
if a gravitational pull...

39:10.394 --> 39:13.261
even as strong
as a cosmic string's...

39:13.296 --> 39:14.923
would affect them.

39:15.032 --> 39:17.865
Please continue.

39:17.901 --> 39:21.860
What if they've chosen
a course to the cosmic string?

39:21.905 --> 39:24.533
A case
of pure stimulus response.

39:24.574 --> 39:30.535
Driven by instinct,
just like the moth to a flame.

39:30.580 --> 39:32.912
If Counselor Troi's
supposition is correct

39:32.949 --> 39:34.678
a replica of the string

39:34.718 --> 39:36.117
projected behind the cluster

39:36.153 --> 39:37.882
could induce them
to reverse course

39:37.921 --> 39:40.890
disrupting the graviton wake
long enough for us to escape.

39:40.924 --> 39:43.392
How do you simulate
a cosmic string?

39:43.427 --> 39:46.885
It has the gravitational
force of a hundred stars.

39:46.930 --> 39:48.397
I do not suggest simulating

39:48.432 --> 39:50.957
the gravitational field
of the string fragment.

39:51.034 --> 39:52.729
Rather, the string's vibration.

39:52.769 --> 39:55.363
Vibration? We're not talking
about a violin, Data.

39:55.405 --> 39:56.770
No, Data's right.

39:56.807 --> 39:58.331
The principle is still the same.

39:58.375 --> 39:59.501
A cosmic string emanates

39:59.543 --> 40:01.602
a characteristic set
of subspace frequencies

40:01.645 --> 40:03.977
as atomic particles decay
along its event horizon.

40:04.047 --> 40:05.776
I could use
the ship's parabolic dish

40:05.816 --> 40:07.716
to amplify and reflect
those frequencies

40:07.751 --> 40:09.378
back toward the cluster.

40:09.419 --> 40:11.751
The <i>Enterprise, </i> itself,
would echo the cosmic string.

40:11.788 --> 40:13.585
How much time do we have,
Mr. Worf?

40:13.623 --> 40:15.147
23 minutes, sir.

40:15.192 --> 40:18.059
Make it so.

40:23.100 --> 40:26.001
Frequency scan detectors
engaged.

40:26.069 --> 40:27.593
Receiving.

40:28.972 --> 40:30.997
Data, we're picking up
frequencies

40:31.074 --> 40:33.099
across the entire
electromagnetic

40:33.143 --> 40:34.906
and lower subspace spectrum.

40:34.945 --> 40:37.505
Trying to isolate.

40:37.547 --> 40:40.345
Data, can you focus
the reflector field for me?

40:40.383 --> 40:42.010
Stand by.

40:42.052 --> 40:46.512
I am differentiating particle
emission signatures now.

40:48.358 --> 40:50.121
Good.
Good. That's doing it.

40:50.160 --> 40:52.355
Patterns are converging.

40:55.599 --> 40:57.362
Same course, same speed.

40:57.400 --> 40:58.526
No change, sir.

40:58.568 --> 41:00.365
We're beginning to encounter

41:00.403 --> 41:02.667
the gravitational effects
of the string.

41:02.706 --> 41:06.107
Impact is in four minutes.

41:06.143 --> 41:08.703
Sir, sheer force turbulence
is impairing our ability

41:08.745 --> 41:10.337
to create
an accurate simulation.

41:10.380 --> 41:12.314
Geordi, fire up
the impulse engines.

41:12.349 --> 41:14.374
Activate the ship's stabilizers.

41:14.417 --> 41:15.543
Stabilizers on.

41:15.585 --> 41:18.281
Electromagnetic
and subspace wave fronts

41:18.321 --> 41:20.585
approaching synchronization.

41:23.794 --> 41:26.354
Three minutes to impact.

41:26.396 --> 41:28.193
Status.

41:28.231 --> 41:29.994
The cluster is unaffected.

41:30.066 --> 41:31.727
Same course, same speed.

41:31.768 --> 41:34.362
Let's try
turning up the volume.

41:34.404 --> 41:36.736
Increase the intensity,
Mr. Data.

41:45.315 --> 41:47.340
They're slowing.

41:47.384 --> 41:50.285
Graviton wake field
is collapsing.

41:50.320 --> 41:52.686
Mr. La Forge,
get us out of here.

41:52.722 --> 41:54.383
With pleasure, sir.

41:59.429 --> 42:03.058
The beings have resumed
their course into the string.

42:03.099 --> 42:05.624
Three seconds to impact.

42:18.281 --> 42:20.841
It's all right.

42:20.884 --> 42:22.511
They're home.

42:22.552 --> 42:25.248
We were wrong.

42:25.288 --> 42:28.086
The cosmic string
was never dangerous to them.

42:28.124 --> 42:31.685
It was the one place in the
galaxy they most wanted to be.

42:31.728 --> 42:33.821
Deanna?

42:35.699 --> 42:37.530
Yes...

42:39.269 --> 42:41.499
I sensed it.

42:51.047 --> 42:53.015
Such overwhelming intensity
of emotion.

42:53.049 --> 42:56.416
When we first encountered them,
it must have been more

42:56.453 --> 42:58.216
than my senses could process.

42:58.255 --> 42:59.722
A short circuit.

42:59.756 --> 43:01.883
Something like that.

43:01.925 --> 43:03.483
Oh, Beverly...

43:03.526 --> 43:05.494
Apology accepted.

43:05.528 --> 43:08.429
Therapists are always
the worst patients.

43:08.465 --> 43:10.660
Except for doctors, of course.

43:12.335 --> 43:14.667
Come by and see me
at my office later, okay?

43:17.908 --> 43:20.968
I was so awful to her.

43:21.011 --> 43:22.911
Well, you were just being human.

43:22.946 --> 43:26.404
I never fully appreciated
how difficult...

43:26.449 --> 43:29.714
and how rewarding it is...
to be human.

43:29.753 --> 43:32.620
But I had a lot of help.

43:32.656 --> 43:34.886
Thanks.

43:34.925 --> 43:38.986
Now, is that Counselor position
still open aboard ship?

43:39.095 --> 43:41.689
It's been taken.

43:41.731 --> 43:44.222
I just thought I'd ask.

43:44.267 --> 43:45.564
Better hours.

43:45.602 --> 43:46.967
Excuse me.

43:49.105 --> 43:50.504
And you...

43:50.540 --> 43:54.237
Thank you for making me face
my other half.

43:54.277 --> 43:56.142
Frightening, wasn't it?

43:56.179 --> 43:57.146
A little.

43:57.180 --> 43:59.648
You were right, though.

43:59.683 --> 44:01.241
There is something to be learned

44:01.284 --> 44:04.617
when you're not in control
of every situation.

44:04.654 --> 44:07.531
Welcome to the human race.

44:08.765 --> 44:13.759
By the way, the next time
you call me "aristocratic..."
