00:05.560 --> 00:07.440
Let the fun commence.

00:07.520 --> 00:09.600
(music plays, whooping, laughter)

00:09.680 --> 00:11.880
'Ex on the Beach is back!'

00:14.560 --> 00:18.680
'Eight new unsuspecting singles
are looking for love.'

00:18.760 --> 00:20.920
'But what they don't know is...'

00:21.000 --> 00:22.120
Fuck!

00:22.200 --> 00:26.120
'...there are more exes
than ever before.'

00:26.200 --> 00:28.880
My arse has fell out me shorts.
You cheated on me!

00:28.960 --> 00:30.920
Stop acting the fucking big man!

00:31.000 --> 00:33.880
You are my best friend
and I wouldn't do that to you!

00:33.960 --> 00:37.800
'And they're flying in
from everywhere.'

00:37.880 --> 00:39.440
(shouting)

00:39.520 --> 00:41.160
(man) Go on!
(laughter)

00:42.360 --> 00:44.360
'Some exes want romance...'

00:45.280 --> 00:47.520
I do really, really love him.

00:47.600 --> 00:49.520
'...some want revenge...'

00:49.600 --> 00:50.960
(shouting, screaming)

00:51.040 --> 00:53.360
(man) Let go now! Let go now!

00:53.440 --> 00:55.560
No-one fuckin' likes ya!
See ya later.

00:55.640 --> 00:59.440
'...and others
just want to wreck the gaff.'

00:59.520 --> 01:01.560
(clattering)
Hey!

01:01.640 --> 01:04.519
That'll be
someone's fucking head in a minute.

01:04.599 --> 01:08.400
'As always, the Tablet of Terror
is topping up the torment...'

01:08.480 --> 01:12.200
It's gonna be fireworks.
'...causing misery...'(sobs)

01:12.280 --> 01:15.200
What am I gonna do?
You will never, ever have me again.

01:15.280 --> 01:17.400
'...mayhem...'
You fucking dickhead!

01:17.480 --> 01:19.880
(screaming)
'...and madness.'

01:19.960 --> 01:21.440
(yelling, laughter)

01:21.520 --> 01:24.440
'It's gonna get... explosive!'

01:24.520 --> 01:27.480
(shouting, screaming)

01:29.320 --> 01:31.360
'Two exes have already arrived...'

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
I hate her guts.
Slag! Slag! Slag! Slag!

01:41.440 --> 01:43.480
My heart is breaking.

02:07.360 --> 02:11.400
If a particular ex comes on,
I think I'll vom on the beach.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.800
Fucking shitting myself.

02:13.880 --> 02:17.160
Fuck me, if one of my bad exes
come out this water,

02:17.240 --> 02:19.360
I am fucking done.

02:20.160 --> 02:21.480
I've got a leg twitch.

02:21.560 --> 02:24.120
Everything's going well
with me and Harriette.

02:24.200 --> 02:27.600
If an ex comes in, it's gonna stir
shit up and could ruin things.

02:46.440 --> 02:48.240
(shouting)

02:48.320 --> 02:49.400
Oh, easy!

02:50.400 --> 02:53.040
What's happening? Hi!
How you doing, babe?Whoo!

02:53.120 --> 02:54.560
You all right?
Yeah. You?

02:54.640 --> 02:55.960
Yes!

02:56.040 --> 02:58.680
She's a good ex,
so I'm fucking buzzing.

02:58.760 --> 03:01.160
Whoo!
Hello.Nice to meet you.

03:01.240 --> 03:04.840
I am smug as fuck. It's not my ex.

03:04.920 --> 03:06.120
Fine. How are you?

03:06.200 --> 03:08.760
She's an absolute rocket!

03:12.080 --> 03:14.680
I'm Nicole, I'm from Essex.
I'm a part-time model

03:14.760 --> 03:16.400
and a full-time nightmare.

03:18.880 --> 03:21.680
I won't be anyone's vice president
in that villa.

03:21.760 --> 03:23.440
I'm the fucking queen.

03:23.520 --> 03:25.840
Yeah, put that in.

03:25.920 --> 03:29.680
I've been single for a couple of
months cos boys are fucking wankers.

03:30.680 --> 03:34.280
I was seeing Josh Ritchie
for, like, a couple of months.

03:34.360 --> 03:36.240
He's a beautiful-looking boy.

03:36.320 --> 03:39.800
But I think I might be a bit too
much for Josh to handle.

03:39.880 --> 03:42.440
Fucking right buzzing, I am.
(laughs)

03:44.360 --> 03:47.480
Excited to see Josh.
We get along well. He's looking fit,

03:47.560 --> 03:48.720
like a salty potato.

03:48.800 --> 03:53.560
I'm... I'm... just glad it weren't
none of my fucking naughty exes.

03:53.640 --> 03:56.840
I feel Josh has feelings for Nicole.
I'm gonna drop him in it,

03:56.920 --> 03:59.960
cos he was in bed with Zara
last night. I'm gonna fuck it up.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.320
She's been with him.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.800
What?Fuck off!
No, he wasn't.

04:04.960 --> 04:07.360
No, I haven't.
Why you trying to shit-stir?

04:07.440 --> 04:08.760
Little twat.

04:08.840 --> 04:10.840
We slept next to each other
in a bed.

04:10.920 --> 04:13.800
Nicole is gorgeous.
I'm getting nowhere with Zara.

04:13.880 --> 04:15.280
I'm gonna fuck her off.

04:15.360 --> 04:17.640
I just spooned...
Well, I wouldn't say...

04:17.720 --> 04:20.519
I'm glad we didn't properly spoon,
put it that way.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.680
Didn't even spoon. We planked.

04:22.760 --> 04:24.720
How about I spoon someone, then?

04:25.960 --> 04:27.640
What if she spooned me?

04:27.720 --> 04:28.800
Really, Ross?

04:30.320 --> 04:32.840
Who wouldn't fancy Ross?
Looks well fit.

04:36.760 --> 04:38.040
Oh, shit!

04:38.120 --> 04:41.160
Oh, fuck off, Tablet of Terror.
"Welcome, Nicole."

04:41.240 --> 04:45.240
"It's date time for you and Ross to
rack it up and get a little loose."

04:46.640 --> 04:48.960
Fucking hell. (blows raspberry)

04:49.720 --> 04:52.760
Date time! Right now,
I'm 100% committed to Harriette,

04:52.840 --> 04:55.000
but who knows what might happen?

04:56.520 --> 04:57.600
See you soon, babe.

04:57.680 --> 04:59.840
Just can't wait
for the games to begin.

04:59.920 --> 05:01.240
Catch you in a bit.

05:01.320 --> 05:02.920
I'm going back to that villa,

05:03.000 --> 05:06.440
getting that big wooden spoon out
of mine and stirring shit up.

05:06.520 --> 05:09.960
Harriette, come here,
I've got some stories to tell you.

05:15.600 --> 05:19.920
'Back at the villa, Alex is pouring
his heart out to Harriette,

05:20.000 --> 05:22.560
about cheating on his ex.'

05:22.640 --> 05:27.560
Obviously this girl you talk about,
yeah... Alice, is it?Yeah, yeah.

05:27.640 --> 05:30.880
So, say for instance,
she was to come in...

05:30.960 --> 05:32.760
what would you want to say to her?

05:35.360 --> 05:38.240
I was a twat
and I was a complete prick to my ex.

05:38.320 --> 05:41.320
After being such a dickhead to her,
and cheating on her,

05:41.400 --> 05:43.520
I wish I could go back
and change it all.

05:44.640 --> 05:47.000
I'd say sorry for everything
and I love her,

05:47.080 --> 05:49.400
and I'm ready to, like,
give it a go, innit?

05:49.480 --> 05:50.680
I suppose.

05:52.320 --> 05:54.280
Aw, babe.
(cries)

05:54.360 --> 05:56.040
Oh, no, he's crying.

05:56.120 --> 05:59.440
You're such a genuine person
with such mad emotions.

05:59.520 --> 06:00.560
Like...
I know.

06:01.560 --> 06:04.520
I fucking hate this guy.
Why d'you hate this guy?

06:04.600 --> 06:08.360
Fucking pussy.It's not that you're
being a great, big, massive pussy.

06:08.440 --> 06:12.720
It's the fact that you have
a really genuine side to you.

06:12.800 --> 06:17.480
(sniffs)I've got
Ross coming back to the villa,

06:17.560 --> 06:21.280
potentially with his ex.
Now I've got Alex crying.

06:21.360 --> 06:24.120
'Oh, my God, how much more stress
can a girl take?'

06:26.880 --> 06:28.560
It's hard, man. Hard, innit?

06:29.560 --> 06:33.440
'Poor Alex(!) Crying cos
you cheated on your girlfriend.'

06:34.800 --> 06:36.640
'Well, it's too late for regrets.'

06:36.720 --> 06:39.760
'Exes are washing up
with one thing on their mind.'

06:39.840 --> 06:41.560
'Revenge.'

06:41.640 --> 06:44.560
'Whose ex is next?'

06:45.640 --> 06:48.920
'With Zahida and Sean
still out on a horse-riding date,

06:49.000 --> 06:52.640
Zahida's ex, Joe,
is trying to get a ride of his own.'

06:52.720 --> 06:56.000
I'm confused about you and Zee.
Like, what...

06:56.080 --> 06:59.200
There's definitely something there.
No, no, there's not.

06:59.280 --> 07:03.000
It's not that. It's because...
She brought back all the feelings...

07:04.400 --> 07:07.440
...I got when with her.
The insecurities, everything.

07:07.520 --> 07:09.720
Maisie seems quite chilled out...

07:09.800 --> 07:12.600
in comparison to Zahida,
who is an absolute nutcase.

07:12.680 --> 07:16.200
I wouldn't want, like, it to ruin
us getting to know each other.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.440
I know Joe can come across
a bit of a dick to some people.

07:21.520 --> 07:23.800
One on one,
he's a really intellectual guy.

07:26.840 --> 07:28.320
I only got to feed the pony.

07:28.400 --> 07:31.320
Tonight, I'm hoping for
a fucking ride the pony.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.480
'Very intellectual, indeed(!)'

07:36.760 --> 07:39.440
It's so relaxing
without Zee in the house.

07:39.520 --> 07:41.000
Here they are!

07:41.080 --> 07:43.000
Oh!
(Zahida)Ooh!

07:44.920 --> 07:47.040
Any romance? Any butterflies?

07:47.120 --> 07:49.520
Er, little kiss at the end.

07:49.600 --> 07:50.880
Fuck off.

07:50.960 --> 07:54.120
Any kick-offs between you two
tonight?Nah.

07:54.200 --> 07:56.920
Erm, no,
but we do need to talk about stuff.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.120
I do like Sean but I love Joe.

07:59.200 --> 08:03.560
But if he's moving on with Maisie,
maybe it's time for me to move on.

08:03.640 --> 08:05.760
It cannae kick off.
There's no point.

08:05.840 --> 08:08.160
'Yeah, good luck with that, Joe.'

08:17.120 --> 08:18.680
Right, what's the craic?

08:19.800 --> 08:22.080
I don't want to talk to you.
Do you not?No.

08:22.160 --> 08:25.120
Still? At all?
Not right now.OK.

08:25.200 --> 08:28.120
I couldn't think of anything worse
than talking to her.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.200
Sit next to Sean.

08:29.280 --> 08:30.760
Yeah, I'm gonna.
Well, go.

08:30.840 --> 08:32.559
I am going.
Sit here, babes.

08:32.640 --> 08:34.360
Fucking hell!

08:34.440 --> 08:37.880
I'm not gonna listen to you anymore.
I've waited long enough.

08:37.960 --> 08:41.640
Why should I respect your feelings
when you don't respect mine?

08:41.720 --> 08:44.000
Look at our matching outfits.

08:44.080 --> 08:46.320
She is an absolute fucking wind-up.

08:48.960 --> 08:52.080
Above and beyond awkward.

08:55.120 --> 08:57.840
'With still no sign of Ross
back from the beach,

08:57.920 --> 09:00.280
it's squeaky-bum time for Harriette.'

09:00.360 --> 09:02.160
I'm really fine, I promise you.

09:02.240 --> 09:04.280
I'm absolutely shitting myself.

09:04.360 --> 09:07.600
You look like you're
bouncing on a dick.(laughter)

09:07.680 --> 09:10.200
(Josh) What's happening, people?

09:10.280 --> 09:13.160
(cheering)
Hey, guess whose ex it were.

09:13.240 --> 09:16.480
Where the fuck... is Ross?

09:18.160 --> 09:21.440
So, Ross is on a date with my ex.
What does she look like?

09:21.520 --> 09:24.040
Rocket.
(laughter)

09:24.120 --> 09:25.920
She's a fiery girl as well. Like,

09:26.000 --> 09:27.720
fiery.
Yeah, rocket, mate.

09:27.800 --> 09:31.200
I just wanna know that, number one,
Ross doesn't like her,

09:31.280 --> 09:33.080
number two, she don't like him,

09:33.160 --> 09:36.640
(Zaralena) What does she look like?
Brown hair, blonde?

09:36.720 --> 09:39.680
Brown hair. Bit like you. (laughs)

09:39.760 --> 09:43.360
Why have you got your spoon out
and stirring it? This is raw.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.520
Only thing is,
she's a bit more tanned.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.360
(laughs) Why am I such a cunt?

09:49.440 --> 09:51.960
Josh, stop it!
She's more tanned.

09:52.040 --> 09:54.160
The more Josh winds Harriette up

09:54.240 --> 09:57.880
the more I can see tears welling up
behind her eyes. Juicy shit!

09:57.960 --> 09:59.640
What's her name?
Nicole.

10:00.760 --> 10:02.640
Fuck. I think I know who she is.

10:02.720 --> 10:04.320
I know who it is.
(Maisie)How?

10:07.000 --> 10:08.160
Who do you think it is?

10:08.240 --> 10:10.600
The girl I was saying
that was his ex.

10:13.360 --> 10:14.480
Fuck.

10:14.560 --> 10:17.240
Oh, shit!
Was it?

10:18.240 --> 10:19.520
Was it?
Yeah.

10:19.600 --> 10:23.360
We're from the same area.
We was with the same guy.

10:23.440 --> 10:25.000
Fucking hell!

10:26.040 --> 10:27.520
This is getting a bit weird.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.920
I reckon they might crack on.
Shut up!

10:30.000 --> 10:33.440
Josh, mate, you fucking lad!
Like, say it how it is.

10:33.520 --> 10:36.520
'Oh-ho-ho! Harriette,
you don't know the half of it.'

10:39.040 --> 10:42.360
'Ross and Nicole are on
a raki-tasting date with a twist.'

10:42.440 --> 10:45.000
'They've gotta taste it
off each other's lips.'

10:46.480 --> 10:49.160
Banana?
I dunno. It was nice, though.

10:50.280 --> 10:51.800
(coughs)

10:56.640 --> 10:58.560
Whoa! Don't get your tongue in.

10:59.680 --> 11:01.160
Urgh! What is it?
Aniseed.

11:01.240 --> 11:04.440
I'm not kissing her,
not breaking any rules. Good boy.

11:04.520 --> 11:06.240
So, what's been going on?

11:06.320 --> 11:09.200
I was the first one to go on a date
and kissed a girl.

11:09.280 --> 11:12.520
Ooh!Erm...And how long
have you been talking to this girl?

11:12.600 --> 11:15.240
Two days.
Oh, my God!

11:15.320 --> 11:17.560
Seems like they've been married off.

11:17.640 --> 11:20.600
I've got the hottest bird in there
at the moment.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.960
So I just stuck with it.

11:22.040 --> 11:25.040
That's a nice thing to say(!)
"I just stuck with it."

11:25.120 --> 11:27.360
Nicole's asking me a lot
about Harriette.

11:27.440 --> 11:30.040
I think she might be
a little bit jealous.

11:30.120 --> 11:31.480
So you've been good?

11:31.560 --> 11:33.320
Yeah, well-behaved, me.

11:33.400 --> 11:34.800
But Josh hasn't?

11:34.880 --> 11:37.720
No, he's been well-behaved.
He just got a cuddle.

11:39.040 --> 11:42.240
Why, are you bothered about it?
Not, really, no.

11:42.320 --> 11:45.680
I like Josh but I don't wanna
throw all my eggs in one basket.

11:45.760 --> 11:47.560
What about me, then?
It's not...

11:47.640 --> 11:51.360
It's not really for me
to get involved with, to be fair.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.200
I'm a good girl.

11:55.280 --> 11:56.920
Girl code!

11:57.000 --> 11:58.320
(laughs)

11:58.400 --> 12:00.000
'Ross is a good-looking boy.'

12:00.080 --> 12:02.360
He's really fun
and easy to get on with.

12:02.440 --> 12:04.760
Shall we do another shot?
I'll do one.

12:11.560 --> 12:16.840
Where is Ross and Nicole right now?
Because I'm not gonna lie,

12:16.920 --> 12:20.080
it is getting late.
I completely forgot about them.

12:20.160 --> 12:24.040
Surely this date can't be going
that well. Hurry the fuck home.

12:24.120 --> 12:27.520
What would you be like
if they necked on? He's not gonna.

12:27.600 --> 12:29.280
(shouting, laughter)

12:29.360 --> 12:33.160
There they fucking are. Look at him,
swagged up. What are you saying?

12:33.240 --> 12:35.360
Rargh, she's ridiculous.

12:35.440 --> 12:38.040
Everyone introduce themselves.

12:38.120 --> 12:39.200
Get a seat.

12:39.280 --> 12:41.640
I've seen Harriette.
She won't look at me.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.480
She's pissed off.

12:44.720 --> 12:47.440
So your name was Z...?
Zahida.Zahida.

12:47.520 --> 12:49.360
Your name is?
Harriette.

12:49.440 --> 12:50.920
How was it? Was it a good day?

12:51.000 --> 12:52.760
Did you neck on?
Nah.

12:52.840 --> 12:56.320
Josh, mate, not everyone's like you,
darling.(laughter)

12:56.400 --> 12:58.960
Ross, you fucking dickhead.
Reassure me.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.040
And you were tasting shots, yeah?

13:01.120 --> 13:03.360
Yeah,
as it basically said on the thing,

13:03.440 --> 13:07.040
you have to taste each other's with
your tongue, but we didn't go...

13:07.120 --> 13:10.200
It...Little tongue?
No, it weren't even little tongue.

13:10.280 --> 13:12.040
It was just like a small peck.

13:12.120 --> 13:13.880
'Are you fucking serious?'

13:13.960 --> 13:16.240
"We lick each other's mouths.
It's fine."

13:16.320 --> 13:19.840
It's not fucking fine.
That's slaggish. Mad slaggish.

13:20.840 --> 13:23.480
All right. Sweet. Just interested.

13:23.560 --> 13:27.280
I've come in and everyone's all
smiley and Harriette's like...

13:27.360 --> 13:30.560
Listen, if anyone's got anything
to say, say it to me.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.760
We didn't tongue each other, snog.

13:32.840 --> 13:35.760
Why are you getting on
the defensive straightaway?

13:35.840 --> 13:38.400
(talks over Nicole)
Nobody's even said that.

13:38.480 --> 13:41.000
She's so lairy.
She's got more attitude,

13:41.080 --> 13:43.680
more fucking front
than Southend fucking front.

13:43.760 --> 13:46.800
You are with a face like
a slapped arse.Not at all, babe.

13:46.880 --> 13:48.800
We're like...
I'm just saying...

13:48.880 --> 13:51.920
You're the one on the defensive.
You need to calm down.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.120
Calm down.Then say it to me
and that's it.Fine.

13:55.200 --> 13:59.160
To be honest, love, I don't really
give a shit what you wanna say.

13:59.240 --> 14:02.920
I wanna have a conversation with
Ross and punch his fucking head in.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.680
'With tensions mounting,

14:05.760 --> 14:09.680
who will be the first to explode
when the next ex arrives?'

14:09.760 --> 14:12.400
'T minus 12 hours.'

14:15.880 --> 14:18.360
Zara,
what's been happening in the house?

14:18.440 --> 14:21.200
Er...
(laughter)

14:21.280 --> 14:24.080
I've just got here
and everyone else is fucked.

14:24.160 --> 14:26.360
Who's with who?
(talk over each other)

14:26.440 --> 14:29.960
Joe. Good to meet you. That's my ex.
Maisie is on my ex's lap.

14:30.040 --> 14:33.720
There's no other chair... Fuck all
to do with you, though, does it?

14:33.800 --> 14:36.680
Doesn't have fuck all
to do with you, does it?

14:36.760 --> 14:38.040
Does it, mug? Mug?

14:38.120 --> 14:40.520
Bang, round 25.

14:40.600 --> 14:44.520
Trying to talk to you all, it's like
you two are at each other's throats.

14:44.600 --> 14:47.920
Must be some sort of toxic,
whether it's love, whether hate.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.440
The only toxic thing is her.

14:50.520 --> 14:53.480
She is poison
and you are doing yourself wrong,

14:53.560 --> 14:57.240
making friends with her. And I'm...
You'll find that out yourself.

14:57.320 --> 15:01.320
If a human's ever been poison,
she is fucking that. She is poison.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.560
Hold on.
You'll find that out yourself.

15:03.640 --> 15:07.360
She's laughing cos she loves it. She
knows how much of a bitch she is.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.040
I'm so confused
about the Joe and Zahida thing.

15:10.120 --> 15:13.400
He's telling me he's not got
feelings, yet he's freaking out.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.320
She knows. Look at her.

15:15.400 --> 15:20.320
Yesterday, you had your fucking
fingers, your hand,

15:20.400 --> 15:23.520
your fist,
your full elbow inside Maisie.

15:23.600 --> 15:26.880
You haven't got a leg to stand on,
or a hand to fist with.

15:26.960 --> 15:30.720
Look at the poison in her eyes, man.
Hold on. You can't put a flower...

15:30.800 --> 15:31.960
Fuck off.

15:32.040 --> 15:34.520
This Joe guy's a lairy little prick.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.120
You can't talk to a girl like that.
Ridiculous.

15:37.200 --> 15:41.360
No one understands the emotion I go
through every time she looks at me.

15:41.440 --> 15:45.200
You slut.Joe, never call a lady
a slut in front of me, please.

15:45.280 --> 15:46.600
Fucking bell-end.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.640
I know for a fact
she's a bullshitter.

15:48.720 --> 15:52.200
I'm looking in your eyes
and I can see the pain in your eyes.

15:52.280 --> 15:54.000
'Joe, kid, calm the fuck down.'

15:54.080 --> 15:55.920
Why don't you finger-blast Maisie

15:56.000 --> 15:58.280
while I can do what I want to
with Zahida?

15:58.360 --> 16:01.600
You have pain and insecurity
in your eyes. It's sad.

16:01.680 --> 16:05.040
Cos you found out she shagged Sean?
Yeah, I can do what I want.

16:05.120 --> 16:08.280
It's fuck all to do with you.
Claiming you're a lady?

16:08.360 --> 16:11.080
I haven't seen that.
Wait!You're a fucking bitch.

16:11.160 --> 16:13.160
(shouting)
All fucking arseholes.

16:13.240 --> 16:16.200
(Zara) And you're a gentleman, babe.
Fuck off.

16:17.400 --> 16:18.840
Fucking stupid...

16:20.880 --> 16:22.280
(yells) Fuck!

16:22.360 --> 16:25.280
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

16:25.360 --> 16:28.040
Joe is a bell-end.

16:28.120 --> 16:29.840
Get me outta here!

16:32.240 --> 16:33.880
Fuck!

16:33.960 --> 16:36.920
Hard nut, boxer.
He's made a hole in the wall.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.160
Idiot.
That's coming out of his pocket.

16:39.240 --> 16:40.920
Sit on my lap.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.080
A shoulder to cry on
and a cock to sit on.

16:43.160 --> 16:46.080
Can't handle this anymore.
I need to get the fuck out.

16:46.160 --> 16:48.520
I'm fucking sick of kicking off,
man.

16:51.080 --> 16:53.200
That little fucking moth
needs to die.

16:55.400 --> 16:57.720
I fucking hate this fucking place!

16:57.800 --> 17:00.880
Fuck's sake!
I'm sick of this fucking shit.

17:01.880 --> 17:03.520
Fucking load of bollocks!

17:04.800 --> 17:08.599
'With Joe still shouting
into his pillow...' (muffled) Fuck!

17:08.680 --> 17:12.480
'...it seems he's not the only one
ending the night on a bum note.'

17:14.040 --> 17:16.480
Argh! Oh, my God!
(laughs)

17:16.560 --> 17:18.000
Fuck you!

17:21.400 --> 17:24.839
(Josh) So, what's your craic?
Do you wanna sleep down with me?

17:24.920 --> 17:29.080
Well, not with you, but I'm gonna
sleep in this big buddle of love.

17:29.160 --> 17:33.920
I really like Josh but I feel
we need to work on our friendship.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.240
'Ah! Looks like Harriette's
not ready to call it a night.'

17:37.320 --> 17:40.120
Did you touch her lips?
I licked her lip.

17:40.200 --> 17:43.360
I don't lick people's mouths.
I don't lick friends' mouths.

17:43.440 --> 17:45.520
I feel like
he's fucked me up the arse.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.120
You're a fucking dickhead!

17:47.200 --> 17:51.240
Playing the game, I went on a date.
You played the fucking game, yeah?

17:51.320 --> 17:52.440
Guilty.

17:53.760 --> 17:55.160
(sniggers)

17:55.240 --> 17:58.040
You're a fucking dickhead.
I ain't doing this shit.

17:58.120 --> 18:00.880
Stay the fuck away from me.

18:00.960 --> 18:03.120
Whole game's gonna change now.

18:03.200 --> 18:05.840
(exhales deeply)

18:05.920 --> 18:09.480
I don't think Harriette
wants anything to do with me.

18:09.560 --> 18:10.960
Where's Nicole?

18:26.760 --> 18:30.920
'Last night was mental. I've been in
this bubble with Ross for two days.'

18:31.000 --> 18:33.560
And, all of a sudden, it's popped.

18:33.640 --> 18:37.120
I haven't done anything wrong.
If you think so, that's cool.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.920
We'll just see
when the boot's on the other foot.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.200
Is that how we're playing it?
All right.

18:44.280 --> 18:47.960
Can't be arsed after days of knowing
someone, having deep convos,

18:48.040 --> 18:51.640
getting told she's gonna
start playing games, so I'm out.

18:54.360 --> 18:57.120
'Could have probably cracked on
last night but...'

18:57.200 --> 18:58.720
girls here are not my type.

18:59.720 --> 19:02.040
'Keep on thinking about my ex.
Er...'

19:02.120 --> 19:05.560
I've been dreaming about her,
especially in this environment.

19:05.640 --> 19:08.440
I'm hoping if she does come in,
I can give her my all,

19:08.520 --> 19:09.920
maybe make it up to her.

19:11.960 --> 19:14.040
'Definitely time to move on
from Joe.'

19:14.120 --> 19:16.560
Fucking psycho.
I can't be dealing with that.

19:16.640 --> 19:19.320
I've had enough fucking psycho exes.
Not again.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.200
It's nice that I can crack on,
have a bit of fun,

19:23.280 --> 19:25.640
just see who wants to get involved.

19:25.720 --> 19:27.640
I can't help but feel sorry for Joe.

19:27.960 --> 19:31.400
I feel like he's came in here
and ruined things for himself.

19:33.800 --> 19:34.880
All right.

19:35.880 --> 19:40.120
The only side everyone's seen is the
angry side. I've seen how he can be.

19:41.120 --> 19:42.560
I need to leave.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.720
I can't stay here anymore.

19:47.280 --> 19:50.480
'I'm sick of... looking like an...'

19:50.560 --> 19:54.600
absolute nutcase because of the-the
raw passion she brings out of me.

19:54.680 --> 19:56.480
I can't do it to myself anymore.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.800
I don't want him to go. (sniffs)

20:02.880 --> 20:05.760
I want you to stay here
and make the most of your time.

20:05.840 --> 20:07.080
I can't hold you back.

20:08.160 --> 20:13.040
I need to get completely away from
her and start afresh in my own head.

20:13.120 --> 20:16.000
But I still love you.
I love you.

20:16.080 --> 20:19.680
(sobs)And I... I-I need you
to know that before I leave.

20:19.760 --> 20:20.960
(sniffs)

20:22.280 --> 20:25.400
I'm telling my true feelings,
which I haven't done here.

20:26.840 --> 20:29.040
I'm in love with you,
but I hate you.

20:29.120 --> 20:31.440
I can't do this to myself anymore.

20:39.280 --> 20:42.720
The thoughts going through my
head... I can't control myself.

20:42.800 --> 20:45.520
You're the only thing
that can get me to that point

20:45.600 --> 20:49.600
where I'm punching walls and I'm...
and kicking off. And you know that.

20:49.680 --> 20:51.400
I'm not good for him.

20:51.480 --> 20:53.520
And I thought I was.

20:53.600 --> 20:58.440
It's just destructive and I have
to just accept it and let go.

21:01.080 --> 21:02.680
I'm gonna pack my bags and go.

21:06.640 --> 21:07.800
(sighs)

21:13.600 --> 21:18.280
(sniffs) I wish it didn't have to
end like this, but I know it does.

21:21.800 --> 21:22.800
(sniffs)

21:27.440 --> 21:28.920
(sobs)

21:33.600 --> 21:37.280
Being here has brought out the best
of us... Fuck! I knew it! You are!

21:37.360 --> 21:40.760
...and the worst of us.
Fuck off. Fucking stupid. Fuck!

21:40.840 --> 21:42.000
I pulled.

21:44.480 --> 21:45.480
I've had banter.

21:45.560 --> 21:47.960
You fucking bitch.
Joe is a massive...

21:48.040 --> 21:49.480
You slut.
...dick.

21:49.560 --> 21:50.560
I'm not an idiot.

21:50.640 --> 21:53.920
Moving forward,
I'm gonna work on myself as a brand.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.800
Fuck!
He's not happy.

21:55.880 --> 21:57.760
I fucking hate this fucking place!

21:57.840 --> 22:00.920
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

22:03.920 --> 22:07.400
'After the morning's drama,
everyone's relaxing.'

22:07.480 --> 22:09.360
'But not for long.'

22:10.640 --> 22:12.520
(ding)
Fuck off.

22:12.600 --> 22:14.960
Oh, no! Here comes trouble.

22:15.040 --> 22:18.800
I'm gonna take that Tablet of Terror
and chuck it in the fucking pool.

22:18.880 --> 22:20.720
Surprise, surprise, guys.

22:20.800 --> 22:24.320
It's time for Sean, Nicole
and Harriette to go to the beach.

22:25.880 --> 22:28.640
It better not fucking be
Sean's ex coming in.

22:29.680 --> 22:30.760
Shit.

22:30.840 --> 22:32.840
'She's just playing games with me.'

22:32.920 --> 22:34.040
She can fuck off.

22:44.760 --> 22:47.320
I'm literally crapping myself.
Literally.

22:47.400 --> 22:50.800
Who's ex is actually that bad?
Mine.

22:50.880 --> 22:53.000
I'm dipping my dick in
whenever I want.

22:53.080 --> 22:55.320
I've gotta explain to my ex,
if she's here,

22:55.400 --> 22:57.800
that my dick is still fresh
from last night.

22:57.880 --> 23:00.120
It could be this guy
that she really likes.

23:00.200 --> 23:02.280
It could be him, babe.
It really could.

23:02.360 --> 23:04.320
If it is him, I'm gonna break down.

23:04.400 --> 23:07.560
I've never loved anyone
like I've loved him before.

23:07.640 --> 23:09.360
We've got one ex in common, Jack.

23:09.440 --> 23:11.720
I was seeing him when I was
19, 20 years old.

23:11.800 --> 23:15.040
I see Jack, like, three days
before I come out here.

23:15.120 --> 23:17.320
I just wanna sort things out
with Ross.

23:17.400 --> 23:20.840
My ex Jack coming out the water
is gonna fuck everything up.

23:34.400 --> 23:37.960
Be honest with me. With Harriette
and the Nicole situation,

23:38.040 --> 23:40.360
do you think
I did anything wrong there?

23:40.440 --> 23:42.400
Whatever.
I don't really give a shit.

23:42.480 --> 23:44.080
Nothing, mate.

23:46.040 --> 23:49.960
You're a good-looking guy and, like,
she's probably luckier to have you.

23:50.040 --> 23:51.920
Ross has feelings for Harriette.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.760
Why?
Probably because she's got a vagina.

23:54.840 --> 23:58.160
She's great-looking, but
I don't think her ex will be better.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.400
I'm not worried
if her ex turns up today.

24:00.480 --> 24:03.360
I'm the fittest guy in the villa,
so I'm not bothered.

24:03.440 --> 24:04.960
I'm just gonna move on now.

24:05.040 --> 24:07.600
Who knows?Yeah.
Might be some birds come in.

24:07.680 --> 24:10.240
Yeah, who knows, mate.
Some hotties.

24:11.240 --> 24:14.840
Your rocket ex might come in.
(they laugh)

24:14.920 --> 24:17.520
She won't go near you boys,
I'm telling you!

24:17.600 --> 24:21.520
She fucking hates guys. She thinks
all guys are cunts, except me,

24:21.600 --> 24:24.480
and I'm the biggest one of all!
(laughs weirdly)

24:24.560 --> 24:26.520
Do you know what I mean?

24:26.600 --> 24:28.040
What a bell-end.

24:28.120 --> 24:30.080
'(chuckles) You said it, Ross.'

24:37.080 --> 24:40.480
I am absolutely shitting it.
Getting tense.

24:57.720 --> 25:00.240
Oh, my God.
What's going on?

25:00.320 --> 25:01.760
I knew it was gonna be Jack.

25:01.840 --> 25:03.120
How you doing?

25:03.200 --> 25:06.080
I'm happy Jack's in here.
He'll get the party going.

25:06.160 --> 25:10.000
Sean. What's your name?Jack. How
you doing? You sweet?Good, babe.

25:10.080 --> 25:12.120
Seeing Jack's face makes me feel...

25:13.400 --> 25:15.240
like home.

25:16.040 --> 25:17.720
What's happening?

25:17.800 --> 25:20.560
(sighs) Oh, fucking hell.

25:24.080 --> 25:26.280
I'm Jack, I'm 24 and I'm from Essex.

25:27.960 --> 25:30.240
I'm not intimidated by no one, nah.

25:30.320 --> 25:31.640
I've got a saying.

25:31.720 --> 25:36.320
Life's a lot like a penis - simple,
soft, straight and hanging free.

25:36.400 --> 25:38.400
Then a woman comes
and makes it hard.

25:40.280 --> 25:41.600
(laughs)

25:42.680 --> 25:44.320
Coming in to two exes...

25:46.160 --> 25:49.800
...it's a bit of a mind-fuck.
I ain't really worried about Nicole,

25:49.880 --> 25:53.720
but as for Harriette,
I'd like to sweeten up with her.

25:53.800 --> 25:56.520
Can I just clear something up?
Whose ex is this?

25:56.600 --> 25:59.240
That was my ex
from a couple years back.

25:59.320 --> 26:01.800
It was so long ago,
I don't think about it.

26:01.880 --> 26:04.240
Ship's sort of sailed now, innit?

26:04.320 --> 26:08.240
As for you, I'd like to rekindle
something with her, sweeten it up.

26:08.320 --> 26:10.240
Oh, my God!

26:11.240 --> 26:14.000
'I can't believe
this is coming out of his mouth.'

26:14.080 --> 26:18.560
This is, like, the first time
I've ever seen him be real with me.

26:18.640 --> 26:21.120
I think that ship's sailed as well.
Has it?

26:21.200 --> 26:24.440
Sean, it's none of your fucking
business. Stay out of it.

26:24.520 --> 26:29.080
There is somebody in there that I've
been, like, talking on a level. Huh?

26:29.160 --> 26:32.960
She's only been in two days,
already grabbing hold of a geezer.

26:33.040 --> 26:34.680
What, you slept with him?
No.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.680
You ain't?No.
So what's happened?

26:36.760 --> 26:39.960
Nothing. We've just been
getting close. Kissed? Talked?

26:40.040 --> 26:43.480
Yeah, we've been talking and there
has been a few, like, kisses.

26:43.560 --> 26:46.000
Do you like the fella?
He is a nice guy,

26:46.080 --> 26:47.800
but, obviously, like...

26:47.880 --> 26:52.120
This is possibly one of the hardest
situations I've ever, ever been in.

26:53.240 --> 26:54.960
Obviously, what?

26:55.040 --> 26:56.880
(exhales deeply)

26:58.480 --> 27:00.960
She's in a sticky situation.
I do feel for her.

27:01.040 --> 27:03.760
First, she was like,
"I just wanna talk to Ross,"

27:03.840 --> 27:06.280
and when Jack turned up,
she was like, "Shit."

27:07.280 --> 27:10.400
You might as well spill the beans,
girl. Come on.

27:12.120 --> 27:14.360
It's just such a weird feeling.

27:14.440 --> 27:18.280
It's a familiar face and when I'm
around him, I do feel really secure.

27:18.360 --> 27:19.760
It's just bringing up...

27:23.440 --> 27:27.440
proper, like... (groans softly)
raw emotion. (sniffs)

27:31.960 --> 27:35.000
I still do like you.
Sweet.

27:35.080 --> 27:36.200
(whispers) Fuck.

27:37.240 --> 27:39.720
We gotta have a word.
So you do wanna talk to me?

27:39.800 --> 27:41.600
Yeah, we'll have a little talk.

27:41.680 --> 27:45.760
If all they've done is kissed,
and a couple little soppy stories,

27:45.840 --> 27:48.840
then, yeah, we might be able to talk
and smooth it over.

27:48.920 --> 27:50.120
See what happens.

27:50.200 --> 27:53.400
I'm not sure how I'm gonna handle
going back to the villa.

27:57.400 --> 27:59.200
Let's have a cheers to tonight.

27:59.280 --> 28:02.760
(all) Cheers.Here's to some more
shit that's gonna come down.

28:02.840 --> 28:04.040
(Jack) Holler!

28:06.040 --> 28:08.320
What's happening?
Yeah, you all right?

28:08.400 --> 28:12.640
'I know who it is. Harriette's ex.
Harriette's shitting herself.'

28:12.720 --> 28:14.360
Her face is just like that.

28:16.160 --> 28:17.800
All I wanna do is talk to Jack

28:17.880 --> 28:22.040
and tell him my side of the story
before anybody else gets there first.

28:22.120 --> 28:24.320
So have you come here for Harriette?

28:24.400 --> 28:27.640
I come to sort things out,
but, obviously, I've heard, like,

28:27.720 --> 28:30.680
you two have been getting
a bit close, know what I mean?

28:30.760 --> 28:32.800
Ross ain't a bad-looking boy, but...

28:32.880 --> 28:35.520
he ain't really got a scratch on me,
has he?

28:35.600 --> 28:38.040
If it's necking on,
it is what it is, innit.

28:38.120 --> 28:39.560
I know yous lot play games.

28:39.640 --> 28:42.360
He's from Essex so he's giving it
the big 'uns a bit.

28:42.440 --> 28:44.520
Yeah.
I'm a boy myself, mate.

28:44.600 --> 28:47.960
I know the craic but I'm gonna
have to have a chat with you.

28:48.040 --> 28:50.400
Not gonna speak to Harriette
before Ross?

28:50.480 --> 28:54.520
No, I'm gonna talk to you first,
mate, get it cleared up.No problem.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.720
It's a man-to-man thing,
innit, babe.

28:58.960 --> 29:02.200
Great(!)
(Josh) Both of yous go for a chat.

29:02.280 --> 29:04.440
(Maisie) All right, guys, good luck.

29:06.440 --> 29:09.200
Nah, it's all good.
What's going on? Sweet, yeah?

29:09.280 --> 29:12.720
Yeah, sweet. To be fair, mate,
you've got nothing to worry about.

29:12.800 --> 29:14.600
'They've unfinished business.'

29:14.680 --> 29:17.200
I ain't getting involved
in no love triangle.

29:17.280 --> 29:19.720
Nothing's happened at all.
Nah.

29:19.800 --> 29:22.840
Just spooned, cuddled.
Yeah.We kissed and that's it.

29:22.920 --> 29:24.680
Er...
How d'you feel about her?

29:24.760 --> 29:28.560
I'll be honest with you. At the
start, I did proper like her.Yeah.

29:28.640 --> 29:32.080
There's not any trust, so in my
eyes, it's done. Done, mate, yeah.

29:32.160 --> 29:33.960
Have her, mate. She's all yours.

29:34.040 --> 29:36.120
Sweet, mate.
Nothing to worry about.

29:36.200 --> 29:38.640
Cool, bruv. Don't worry about that.

29:38.720 --> 29:40.640
He's a drip, at the end of the day.

29:40.720 --> 29:42.160
Old fucking grey hair,

29:42.240 --> 29:45.280
he looks like he's done an 'eadstand
in an ashtray.

29:45.360 --> 29:48.080
'It looks like
Jack's making himself at home,

29:48.160 --> 29:53.360
but nobody should get too comfortable
as the next ex has already landed.'

29:53.440 --> 29:56.320
'Expect the unexpected.'

29:57.440 --> 30:01.400
So, obviously, you told him that
it's done between me and you, yeah?

30:01.480 --> 30:03.360
Yeah.
Cool.

30:03.440 --> 30:06.200
I'm not second-best
and I won't be second-best.

30:06.280 --> 30:10.280
I don't feel we've got a lot more to
say to each other, then. All right.

30:10.360 --> 30:12.160
He's the one that fucked us up.

30:16.920 --> 30:20.240
Babe, you've had the best,
now it's time to have the rest.

30:34.280 --> 30:38.320
Let's all do impressions of each
other. We've gotta guess who it is.

30:39.320 --> 30:40.840
Who's starting?
Ready.

30:40.920 --> 30:44.640
I don't give a fuck about you,
I'm gonna fucking kick off!

30:44.720 --> 30:46.400
(girls) Joe!

30:46.480 --> 30:48.720
(laughter)

30:49.800 --> 30:52.000
(tablet dings)

30:53.000 --> 30:54.160
(shouting)

30:54.240 --> 30:55.960
(girl) Oh, God.
Ohhh!

30:56.040 --> 30:58.120
Are you fucking joking me?

30:58.200 --> 30:59.880
(laughs)

30:59.960 --> 31:01.080
No! What?

31:01.160 --> 31:04.920
Welcome to the villa, Jack,
but you're not the only new arrival.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.840
This place is fucking nuts.

31:07.920 --> 31:10.160
Alex's ex is here.

31:10.240 --> 31:12.720
(laughs)
(cheering)

31:12.800 --> 31:14.080
Oh, shit!

31:14.160 --> 31:15.320
Really?

31:15.400 --> 31:17.320
(groans, imitates screams)

31:17.400 --> 31:20.080
Here we go!
(they talk over each other)

31:22.000 --> 31:24.600
(whooping, cheering)
(boy) Oh, my God!

31:24.680 --> 31:26.560
(screams)

31:27.560 --> 31:30.000
Since when do exes
just turn up on the balcony?

31:30.080 --> 31:33.720
That's mine and Sean's
fucking bedroom. Get out, you bitch.

31:33.800 --> 31:35.960
Jump off! (laughs)

31:41.760 --> 31:45.440
I'm Alice
and I'm a dancer in Ibiza.

31:45.520 --> 31:48.240
I met Alex in Marbella.
We just clicked instantly.

31:49.440 --> 31:51.760
And we had, like,
a life in London together.

31:51.840 --> 31:54.720
And it went sour because he cheated.

31:56.680 --> 31:59.080
He had another girlfriend.
Behind my back.

32:00.640 --> 32:01.960
Broke my heart.

32:04.640 --> 32:07.640
"Alex's ex is here, but who will be
the first to greet her,

32:07.720 --> 32:10.320
with a champagne reception?"
(boy)Oh, shit.

32:10.400 --> 32:13.600
"Josh, the control is in your
hands."(whooping, applause)

32:15.040 --> 32:17.320
"Will it be Alex,
or will it be you?"

32:17.400 --> 32:20.360
The geezer's arse
is gonna fall fucking right out.

32:20.440 --> 32:21.800
(laughter, shouting)

32:21.880 --> 32:25.400
(girl) What are you gonna do?
(Jack)What are you gonna do, bruv?

32:25.480 --> 32:28.040
What's happening? What's your name?

32:28.120 --> 32:30.400
I'll let Alex watch from window.

32:30.480 --> 32:32.080
(laughter, cheering)

32:37.440 --> 32:41.080
Josh has chose to fucking go to the
penthouse so he can fuck off now.

32:41.160 --> 32:44.600
If he wants to play that game,
I'll play it back.(laughter)

32:44.680 --> 32:46.440
'I've had the shittest day.'

32:46.520 --> 32:49.720
I'm gonna be crying in about an hour,
so I'm gonna enjoy it.

32:49.800 --> 32:52.120
(they talk over each other)

32:52.200 --> 32:53.200
(laughter)

32:54.480 --> 32:59.120
Alex looks like he's relieved
and shit himself at the same time.

32:59.200 --> 33:02.160
(imitates sobbing,
inhales sharply, laughs)

33:03.760 --> 33:05.080
(girl) Ruthless, Josh.

33:05.160 --> 33:06.880
Oh, it is so real.

33:06.960 --> 33:10.280
'It's not fun.
It's actually like living in hell.'

33:11.520 --> 33:15.240
What's happening? I'm Josh.
Hi, Josh. Nice to meet you. Alice.

33:15.320 --> 33:18.280
Cheers, Alex, for your ex-missus.
Heh-heh!

33:18.360 --> 33:22.560
(Nicole) Just sort of deep-breath it.
I'm going up there.You can't.

33:22.640 --> 33:24.240
Just don't make things worse.

33:24.320 --> 33:26.200
'All I wanna do is talk to Alice.'

33:26.280 --> 33:29.080
But I can't,
cos that fucking prick's in the way.

33:29.160 --> 33:32.200
(cork pops) Has he done bad
towards you? Obviously.

33:32.280 --> 33:34.320
I'm gonna fuckin' reyt stitch him up.

33:35.320 --> 33:38.280
So you're not looking
to get back with him?

33:38.360 --> 33:41.240
No.You're not looking
to get back with him?No.

33:41.320 --> 33:46.120
One sec, let me tip my drink, then
we'll cheers to that. (they laugh)

33:46.200 --> 33:49.480
Just chill out and you'll be fine.
(boys talk over each other)

33:49.560 --> 33:51.280
Chill out, you'll be cool.

33:51.360 --> 33:55.240
I can't wait to see her and talk to
her and, like, have a chat with her.

33:55.320 --> 33:58.160
Why's the reasons
from you and Alex splitting up?

33:59.160 --> 34:04.080
Well, he was unfaithful.
Unfaithful?A lot. Numerous times.

34:04.160 --> 34:05.960
Wow!

34:07.280 --> 34:11.600
(Maisie) Nothing's gonna happen.
He's fucking going. Can't stop him.

34:15.040 --> 34:19.280
I think it'd only ever happen
if I...Right.Oh, God.

34:19.360 --> 34:21.480
The geezer hisself.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.280
'Think his ears are burning.'

34:23.360 --> 34:25.120
How you doing?
I'm OK.

34:25.199 --> 34:28.320
D'you want a drink, mate?
I missed you, man.No.Yeah, go on.

34:28.400 --> 34:32.080
Want a drink? We'll air a few things
out, if you want. Yeah, let's do it.

34:32.159 --> 34:35.000
He's sat there with a smug look
on his face.

34:35.080 --> 34:36.880
I'm gonna ruin his life.

34:37.920 --> 34:42.199
Me, Sean and Maisie are desperately
trying to peer up onto the balcony.

34:42.280 --> 34:44.320
Shit's going down.

34:44.400 --> 34:47.960
I feel like Alex...
wants to get back with you,

34:48.040 --> 34:52.120
but you look like you just wanna
leave it... move on wi' your life.

34:52.199 --> 34:55.360
A couple of months ago,
I did wanna be with you.Yeah.

34:55.440 --> 34:57.680
But now you wanna move on?
Yeah.

34:58.680 --> 34:59.680
Really?

35:00.520 --> 35:03.920
I can't believe she said that.
That's a bit sore to hear, like.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.920
I'm so upset with you.Why?
Cos I just am.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.760
I care about Alex,
but not in that way anymore.

35:10.840 --> 35:12.720
Leave it.
Why are you like this?

35:12.800 --> 35:15.520
I'm not gonna lie, Alex, mate...
Yeah.

35:15.600 --> 35:19.480
If we kiss, are you gonna be pissed
off? Not gonna happen anyway, bruv.

35:20.480 --> 35:22.520
Josh fucking loves it, don't he?

35:22.600 --> 35:24.960
So...
no need to get aggressive, mate.

35:25.040 --> 35:27.480
I'm gonna wipe that smile
right off his face.

35:27.560 --> 35:30.000
I'm just drinking my drink,
know what I mean?

35:30.080 --> 35:31.960
She's reyt good-looking as well.

35:34.120 --> 35:36.120
He won't shut the fuck up.
Oh, my God!

35:36.200 --> 35:38.920
No need to get aggressive.
Fucking hate his guts.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.160
What the fuck have you done?
Why are you getting aggressive?

35:42.240 --> 35:44.680
(sighs)
You spit your dummy out there.

35:44.760 --> 35:47.960
You spit your dummy out.
I think it's quite shit from you.

35:48.040 --> 35:51.160
Can I go downstairs?That wasn't
towards you, was it, huh?

35:51.240 --> 35:53.240
Doesn't matter, Alex.
Huh?

35:53.320 --> 35:54.960
Can we talk in here a second?

35:55.040 --> 35:58.880
(they talk indistinctly)
Talk in here now. Come in here now.

35:58.960 --> 36:00.800
Has everyone had a good night?

36:01.840 --> 36:04.640
I've had a lovely night.
I smell of champagne a bit.

36:04.720 --> 36:07.720
I fucking do love you to pieces,
man. I fucking do.

36:07.800 --> 36:09.040
(sniffs)

36:09.120 --> 36:12.440
I just wanna make it all up to you.
I want you to be my wife, man.

36:14.360 --> 36:17.160
(sighs).I do. I wanna marry you.
You know that.

36:17.240 --> 36:18.840
And I treated you like a cunt.

36:20.200 --> 36:23.280
It's horrible because I thought
I would have married him,

36:23.360 --> 36:24.480
but just no.

36:25.560 --> 36:29.280
I don't think she's in love with him
anymore. That's all I'm saying.

36:29.360 --> 36:32.440
(laughs, claps) Fucking hell.

36:33.440 --> 36:35.880
I was always there for you.
I love you, man.

36:35.960 --> 36:40.000
I... I quit my job, I-I...
I moved to Marbella.I know you did.

36:40.080 --> 36:42.960
He has seen me cry on my knees.

36:43.040 --> 36:45.080
And he still wanted to cheat.

36:45.160 --> 36:48.760
I did everything. Did you come home
at night, take me out for dinner?

36:48.840 --> 36:51.560
You didn't even take me out
for dinner.I'm sorry.

36:52.560 --> 36:55.160
'Not going very well, is it, Alex?'

36:55.240 --> 36:59.000
'Let's see if Harriette is having
more luck with her ex, Jack.'

36:59.080 --> 37:02.560
I fucked up, like...
What you done is a shock to me.

37:02.640 --> 37:04.520
It is.
Yeah, I know. I know.

37:04.600 --> 37:06.760
It is. I see it, I see it.
It's muggy, mate.

37:06.840 --> 37:10.920
I see your face. It's muggy, innit. I
had to hold back, innit, out there.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.760
All I wanna do is build trust back

37:13.840 --> 37:17.480
with somebody that I really respect
and care about.

37:17.560 --> 37:19.520
Yeah,
I got a bit of grovelling to do.

37:19.600 --> 37:22.160
What?I've got grovelling to do.
Yeah, you have.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.920
I'm really shit at this.
You have, though.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.640
Who d'you wanna go to bed with,
me or numbnuts?

37:29.240 --> 37:31.640
Obviously, like,
I wanna go bed with you.

37:32.560 --> 37:33.800
'Appy days.

37:33.880 --> 37:35.600
Come. Let's go.

37:38.040 --> 37:40.880
(sobs) I just love you, man.
Don't do this to me, baby.

37:40.960 --> 37:44.480
Please don't do this to me, babe.
Please. (sobs) I beg you.

37:49.960 --> 37:52.280
(exhales deeply)

37:53.280 --> 37:54.840
(sniffs)

37:54.920 --> 37:58.320
I thought it was gonna be,
but, obviously, I've ruined it.

38:00.360 --> 38:04.240
I've just had enough. I really...
I really have had enough.

38:07.840 --> 38:09.840
I just wanna sort it out with you.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.400
I have to go home.

38:11.480 --> 38:12.800
I can't take this.

38:17.200 --> 38:21.680
I just wanna be with you,
Alice, man, so bad.
