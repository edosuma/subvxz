00:57.024 --> 00:58.589
        Did you bring in        
    the Sunday paper?

No, not yet.

      Edith!                    

01:51.111 --> 01:54.145
  I'm sorry I'm late, Archie.   

01:54.147 --> 01:55.780
     Here's your breakfast.     

01:55.782 --> 01:57.048

02:03.957 --> 02:06.524
Who did that?                   

02:06.526 --> 02:10.394
    I wouldn't know, Edith.     
The artist didn't sign it.      

02:10.395 --> 02:11.830
I'm calling the cops.           

02:11.832 --> 02:13.598
                  Oh, yeah,     
                  call the cops.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.066
      That's a good idea.       

02:15.068 --> 02:16.701
            Calling the cops?   
            What's going on?    

02:16.703 --> 02:17.802
Look at the door.               

02:23.308 --> 02:25.309
                    Yeah?       

02:25.311 --> 02:26.611
You meathead.                   

02:26.613 --> 02:28.479
Open the door                   
and look on the outside.        

02:29.782 --> 02:31.750
              You didn't tell me
              to open the door. 

02:31.752 --> 02:33.752
             All you said was   
             "Look at the door."

02:33.754 --> 02:35.653
                 You didn't say,
                 "Open the door 

02:35.655 --> 02:37.355
              and look at it    
              from the outside."

02:37.357 --> 02:40.058
         All you said           
         was "Look at the door."

02:40.060 --> 02:43.995
Open the damn door              
and look at the outside of it!  

02:43.997 --> 02:45.864
        All right.              

02:45.866 --> 02:47.465
        You didn't say,         
        "Open the door."        

02:47.467 --> 02:48.833
Open it!

    A swastika.                 

02:54.107 --> 02:55.706
            Hey, Gloria,        
            did you see this?   

02:55.708 --> 02:57.341
             What?              

02:57.343 --> 02:59.911
        Oh, Michael, who        
        could have done that?   

02:59.913 --> 03:01.146
 Probably the same crummy kids  

03:01.148 --> 03:02.847
  that busted the street lamp   
        last week.              

03:02.849 --> 03:05.150
I wonder if they did it         
to other houses. I'll look.     

03:05.152 --> 03:07.351
        Who cares?              
I know they done it to my house.

03:07.353 --> 03:09.053
     And they ain't getting     
         away with it.          

03:09.055 --> 03:10.822
     I'm calling the cops.      

03:10.824 --> 03:13.557
    Hello. Hello. Is this--?    

03:13.559 --> 03:15.726
              Huh?              

03:15.728 --> 03:17.061
     How do you like this?      

03:17.063 --> 03:19.664
     I call the cops, I get     
 a recorded announcement here.  

03:23.302 --> 03:24.635
    "The lines are all busy.    

03:24.637 --> 03:26.537
"Do not hang up the phone.      

03:26.539 --> 03:30.275
Your call will be answered      
when the lines are clear."      

03:30.277 --> 03:34.245
    The lines would be clear    
if they wasn't playing records. 

03:34.247 --> 03:35.713
                      Michael...

03:35.715 --> 03:37.982
         Michael, did they paint
         any of the other doors 

03:37.984 --> 03:39.184
                on the block?   

03:39.186 --> 03:40.484
No, just this house.            

03:40.486 --> 03:42.320
            Why do kids do      
            things like that?   

03:42.322 --> 03:43.688
Gloria, I don't                 
think it's kids.                

03:43.690 --> 03:45.690
There's a lot of fanatics       
running around loose these days.

03:45.692 --> 03:47.391
Who cares?                      
Whoever done it,                

03:47.393 --> 03:49.194
I'm going to get them           
for it, that's all.             

03:49.196 --> 03:51.595
Now, here, you stay on          
the blower till the cops answer.

03:51.597 --> 03:52.864
        All right.              

03:52.866 --> 03:54.065
What about you,                 
little girl?                    

03:54.067 --> 03:55.867
    You hear anything last night
    when you were sleeping?     

03:55.869 --> 03:57.668
            The cops are going  
            to want to know that

03:57.670 --> 03:58.703
             when they get here.

03:58.705 --> 04:00.504
No, Daddy, all I heard          
was your alarm clock            

04:00.506 --> 04:01.706
when it went off                
this morning.                   

04:01.708 --> 04:04.675
                  And that's    
                  another thing.

04:04.677 --> 04:08.412
     Why did the alarm clock    
     go off on a Sunday morning?

04:08.414 --> 04:09.580
                        Huh?    

04:09.582 --> 04:11.582
        I was out of bed and    
        halfway to the toilet   

04:11.584 --> 04:13.417
        before I remembered     
        I didn't have to get up.

04:15.554 --> 04:18.488
I'm sorry, Archie,              
but I wanted to get up          

04:18.491 --> 04:20.423
and put a cake                  
in the oven                     

04:20.426 --> 04:21.860
for Louise Jefferson.           

04:21.862 --> 04:24.528
It's her anniversary            
tomorrow.                       
                    Tomorrow?   

04:24.530 --> 04:25.997
            Well, why are you   
            rigging the alarm   

04:25.999 --> 04:27.465
                      for today?

04:27.467 --> 04:31.769
  Well, I figured if the cake   
  didn't turn out good today,   

04:31.771 --> 04:35.073
 I'd have another chance at it  
        tomorrow.               

04:37.343 --> 04:38.877
              Oh.               

04:38.879 --> 04:40.678
Why do I ask her anything?      

04:40.680 --> 04:42.813
            Hey, Arch,          
            I got the police.   

04:42.815 --> 04:44.015
All right,                      
give me the phone.              

04:44.017 --> 04:45.016
            Hold on a second.   

04:45.018 --> 04:46.450
Give me                         
the phone there.                

04:46.452 --> 04:49.687
Hello, the police.              

04:49.689 --> 04:52.690
  Yeah, this is Archie Bunker,  
    704 Hauser Street.          

04:52.692 --> 04:54.125
     I've got a complaint.      

04:54.127 --> 04:55.693
      Last night, sometime      
    during the night,           

04:55.695 --> 04:56.995
    someone come around here    

04:56.997 --> 04:59.964
      and paint a swastika      
    on my front door.           

04:59.966 --> 05:01.299
        Swastika.               

05:01.301 --> 05:05.236
          Swas-ti-ka.           

05:05.238 --> 05:07.738
  You know, one of them German  
things from World War II.       

05:10.075 --> 05:12.476
 Yeah, well, can you come over? 

05:12.478 --> 05:14.012
        All right, good.        
    That's all I want.          

05:14.014 --> 05:15.613
    Yeah, thanks very much.     

05:15.615 --> 05:17.415
All right, we'll get            
to the bottom of this.          

05:17.417 --> 05:18.816
    The cops are going          
         to come over           

05:18.818 --> 05:20.018
            and have            
  a little investigation here.  

05:20.020 --> 05:21.319
Oh, I better                    
get something                   

05:21.321 --> 05:23.121
to wipe that                    
off the door.                   

05:23.123 --> 05:25.123
                         No, no!

05:28.360 --> 05:29.527
                What do you want

05:29.529 --> 05:31.029
                  to wipe it off
                  the door for? 

05:31.031 --> 05:32.397
                    I want it   
                    on the door.

05:32.399 --> 05:33.798
                 I want the cops
                 to see that.   

05:33.800 --> 05:35.166
            That is evidence.   

05:35.168 --> 05:36.467
                    Catch on?   

05:36.469 --> 05:37.701
            Yeah, but, Daddy,   
            in the meantime     

05:37.703 --> 05:39.037
                everyone else   
                can see it.     

05:39.039 --> 05:40.704
  Good thinking, little girl.   

05:40.706 --> 05:42.706
    All right, we'll fix it     
     so nobody else sees it     

05:42.708 --> 05:44.042
                till the cops   
                get here.       

05:44.044 --> 05:45.509
        I'm going               
    to cover that thing up.     

05:45.511 --> 05:46.710
EDITH: With what,               
Archie?                         

05:46.712 --> 05:48.479
                 Oh, wait till  
                 you see, Edith.

05:48.481 --> 05:53.184
I'm going to cover that thing up
      with Old Glory here.      

05:53.186 --> 05:55.119
      This put the kibosh       
on the Nazis once before.       

05:55.121 --> 05:56.354
It's going to do it again.      

05:56.356 --> 05:57.688
      Get the thumbtacks.       

05:57.690 --> 06:01.125
 Oh, why don't you stick it up  
    with tape, Archie?          

06:01.127 --> 06:02.460
    Thumbtacks, huh, Edith?     

06:02.462 --> 06:03.894
     Tape would be better.      

06:03.896 --> 06:06.164
Why would tape be better?       

06:06.166 --> 06:08.933
         Because I know         
    where the tape is.          

06:15.374 --> 06:17.108
    Will somebody get           
        the thumbtacks?         

06:17.110 --> 06:18.109
            All right, Daddy.   

06:18.111 --> 06:19.444
      Would you calm down?      

06:19.446 --> 06:21.846
          Jeez, I know          
where the thumbtacks are.       

06:21.848 --> 06:22.981
            ARCHIE: Hurry up.   

06:22.983 --> 06:25.016

16:42.166 --> 16:44.601
         Mr. Benjamin,          
I think you got the wrong house.

16:44.603 --> 16:46.904
     There's no Bloom here.     
     This is Archie Bunker.     

16:46.906 --> 16:48.204
Archie Bunker.                  

16:48.206 --> 16:50.340
    And I can testify           
      that he is not now,       

16:50.342 --> 16:51.575
     nor has he ever been,      

16:51.577 --> 16:54.277
 a member of the Jewish faith.  

16:54.279 --> 16:56.012
At no time.                     

16:56.014 --> 16:57.815
          Then why did the goons
          who painted your door 

16:57.817 --> 16:59.783
        mistake this place      
        for David Bloom's place?

16:59.785 --> 17:02.653
    You mean the David Bloom    
  that's on the school board?   

17:02.655 --> 17:06.490
Oh, he lives up at the end      
  of the block, at number 740.  

17:06.492 --> 17:08.090
    Our house is number 704.    

17:08.093 --> 17:10.093
Oh, that Bloom.                 

17:10.095 --> 17:11.762
That's that                     
bigmouth liberal                

17:11.763 --> 17:14.196
who's always trying to run      
for the city council.           

17:14.199 --> 17:16.500
Oh, I get it now.               

17:16.502 --> 17:20.637
This here swastika              
belongs to Bloom.               

17:20.638 --> 17:21.637
Oh. Well, jeez.                 

17:21.640 --> 17:24.406
I feel a lot better             
about that.                     

17:24.409 --> 17:26.309
It makes you feel better?       

17:26.310 --> 17:27.810
Arch, a man is being threatened.

17:27.813 --> 17:30.714
When he talks,                  
never listen.                   

17:30.716 --> 17:31.715
Now, Paulie,                    

17:31.717 --> 17:33.316
I want to show you              
where Bloom lives,              

17:33.318 --> 17:35.519
    right up at this house      
    at the end of the corner.   

17:35.521 --> 17:36.520
    You'd better go up there.   

17:36.522 --> 17:37.754
Where the hell                  
are you going?                  

17:37.756 --> 17:39.189
                  Wait. Hold it 
                  a minute, now.

17:39.191 --> 17:41.358
          You know that swastika
          was meant for Bloom,  

17:41.360 --> 17:43.894
        and I know that swastika
        was meant for Bloom,    

17:43.896 --> 17:45.729
        but they think          
        it was meant for you.   

17:45.731 --> 17:47.531
"They"?                         
Who's "they"?                   

17:47.533 --> 17:49.833
              The creeps that   
              painted your door.

17:49.835 --> 17:52.102
They still think                
this is David Bloom's place,    

17:52.104 --> 17:54.104
so we got to be ready           
for them right here.            

17:54.106 --> 17:56.339
And who's "we"?                 
You keep saying that.           

17:56.341 --> 17:57.440
            Yeah. Who's "we"?   

17:57.442 --> 17:58.809
The H.D.A.                      

17:58.811 --> 18:01.244
      Oh, boy, that's the Hebrew
      Defense Association.      

18:01.246 --> 18:02.412
                    ARCHIE: Huh?

18:02.414 --> 18:04.381
              Arch, that's a    
              strong-arm outfit.

18:04.383 --> 18:06.182
         It's a vigilante group.

18:06.184 --> 18:07.183
                    Hold it.    

18:07.185 --> 18:11.121
                Vigilante sounds
                good to me.     

18:11.123 --> 18:13.089
        That could be           
        something good there.   

18:13.091 --> 18:15.091
            Wait a minute.      
            What do you guys do?

18:15.093 --> 18:16.593
         What they do.          

18:16.595 --> 18:18.128
    If they use force,          
         we use force.          

18:18.130 --> 18:19.129
                        Good.   

18:19.131 --> 18:21.297
 Yeah, but violence won't help. 

18:21.299 --> 18:24.568
         Wouldn't hurt.         

18:24.570 --> 18:26.469
        Michael's right.        
    Just because some people    

18:26.471 --> 18:28.238
    do some terrible things     
        to other people         

18:28.240 --> 18:30.607
doesn't give you the right      
     to do the same thing.      

18:30.609 --> 18:31.942
      That's just revenge.      

18:31.944 --> 18:33.143
What's the matter with revenge? 

18:33.145 --> 18:36.312
      It's the perfect way      
          to get even.          

18:37.582 --> 18:39.550
You're catching on, <i>bubbe.</i>      

18:39.552 --> 18:41.018
Why don't you                   
catch on?                       

18:41.020 --> 18:43.420
Any thinking person has gone    
past the idea of revenge        

18:43.422 --> 18:44.922
a long time ago.                

18:44.924 --> 18:48.692
  Any thinking person knows     
  that <i>Homo sapiens</i> is a killer.

18:48.694 --> 18:51.361
          <i>Homo sapiens?</i>         

18:51.363 --> 18:54.731
         Is he an Arab?         

18:54.733 --> 18:56.667
        No, Edith.              

18:56.669 --> 19:00.336
         <i>Homo sapiens,</i>          
       that's a killer fag.     

19:08.179 --> 19:11.414
  Arch... <i>Homo sapiens</i> is man,  

19:11.416 --> 19:13.483
    and man invented the law    
      to protect himself.       

19:13.485 --> 19:15.052
             Law? Law? What law?

19:15.054 --> 19:16.152
     What are you talking about?

19:16.154 --> 19:17.888
 A law that lets a gang of thugs

19:17.890 --> 19:19.590
        get away with painting  
        swastikas on doors, huh?

19:19.592 --> 19:21.224
Or killing innocent hostages?   

19:21.226 --> 19:23.226
         That lets them kill off
         one religion in--      

19:23.228 --> 19:24.661
in the name of another religion?

19:24.663 --> 19:25.862
     Look. That's your law.     

19:25.864 --> 19:26.964
      Yeah, that's right.       

19:26.966 --> 19:28.899
 Listen, if some guy, Meathead, 

19:28.901 --> 19:31.501
    runs around doing damage    
    to some other guy,          

19:31.503 --> 19:34.738
  the only decent thing to do   
    is knock him off,           

19:34.740 --> 19:36.640
    and if you can't do that    
          by yourself,          

19:36.642 --> 19:37.708
      the best thing to do      

19:37.710 --> 19:39.109
         is bring back          
     the old death penalty.     

19:39.111 --> 19:40.510
        I don't believe         
what you're saying, Arch!       

19:40.512 --> 19:42.879
    Don't you see that makes    
  murderers out of all of us?   

19:42.881 --> 19:44.180
I don't want to murder anybody, 

19:44.182 --> 19:46.382
and I don't want the state      
      doing it in my name!      

19:46.384 --> 19:48.118
Ah, go eat a marshmallow.       

19:51.188 --> 19:52.723
             What are you,      
             some kind of saint?

19:52.725 --> 19:56.760
  Look, all I'm saying is       
  I know the guys that did that,

19:56.762 --> 19:58.528
                and if it comes 
                to killing, hey,

19:58.530 --> 19:59.963
                     better them

19:59.965 --> 20:01.865
                     than my    
                     <i>bubbe</i> here.

20:01.867 --> 20:03.433
             Hey...             

20:03.435 --> 20:05.602
 That's some straight thinking  
          there, Paul.          

20:05.604 --> 20:06.737
Straight thinking?!             

20:06.739 --> 20:08.138
Arch, if this guy's             
lips wasn't moving,             

20:08.140 --> 20:10.340
I'd swear those were your words 
coming out of his mouth.        

20:10.342 --> 20:12.308
         That's right,          
because this guy's making sense.

20:12.310 --> 20:13.309
                         Thanks.

20:13.311 --> 20:15.178
 Don't mention it there, <i>bubbe.</i> 

20:18.716 --> 20:22.619
Mr. Benjamin, hasn't there been 
        enough fighting?        

20:22.621 --> 20:24.755
     I mean, isn't it time      
      that people sat down      

20:24.757 --> 20:26.422
and talked their problems over  
with one another?               

20:26.424 --> 20:27.758
          No, no, no.           

20:27.760 --> 20:30.093
    We've had it with that.     
    Up to here we've had it.    

20:30.095 --> 20:31.494
         No more talk!          

20:31.496 --> 20:33.596
You can't talk to bullets.      

20:33.598 --> 20:35.598
      Oh, what's the use?       

20:35.600 --> 20:37.901
  When will people understand?  

20:37.903 --> 20:41.271
Careful, you'll                 
hurt yourself.                  

20:41.273 --> 20:43.206
             Yeah, it's an awful
             shot in the head   

20:43.208 --> 20:44.607
                 you give       
                 yourself there.

20:44.609 --> 20:46.843
I'll tell you, better this kind 
      of shot in the head       

20:46.845 --> 20:48.011
        than this kind.         

20:48.013 --> 20:49.012
    You ain't kidding.          

20:49.014 --> 20:50.413
          You're right,         

20:50.415 --> 20:52.615
 and that's what me and my boys 
      are here to prevent.      

20:52.617 --> 20:54.017
ARCHIE: You got                 
some boys with you?             

20:54.019 --> 20:55.418
        They'll be here         
    in a few minutes.           

20:55.420 --> 20:56.820
Daddy, Daddy,                   
I'm scared of this man.         

20:56.822 --> 20:58.221
Would you please                
ask him to leave?               

20:58.223 --> 20:59.222
                  What are you  
                  talking about,

20:59.224 --> 21:00.557
    ask him to leave?           

21:00.559 --> 21:03.193
Some bum comes and paints       
     a swastika on my door.     

21:03.195 --> 21:05.762
Paul is only here just to get   
even with them, that's all.     

21:05.764 --> 21:06.930
Tit for tat, right?             

21:06.932 --> 21:08.932
          Yeah, well, we call it
          "An eye for an eye,"  

21:08.934 --> 21:09.800
        but it's the same thing.

21:11.402 --> 21:12.969
    Whatever happened           
to "Turn the other cheek"?      

21:12.971 --> 21:14.905
You can't do                    
that no more.                   
                     He's right.

21:14.907 --> 21:16.173
        He's not right.         

21:16.175 --> 21:18.175
    You stick to your Testament,
    and I'll stick to mine.     

21:18.177 --> 21:19.676
          Fine, fine.           

21:19.678 --> 21:20.811
     Doesn't your Testament     

21:20.813 --> 21:22.012
         say something          
about loving thy neighbor?      

21:22.014 --> 21:23.213
                      All right,
                      all right.

21:23.215 --> 21:25.281
    Look, say you're walking    
        down the street         

21:25.283 --> 21:26.817
      with your wife here,      

21:26.819 --> 21:28.418
and some creep comes up         
and jumps her.                  

21:28.420 --> 21:30.187
What are you                    
going to do?                    

21:30.189 --> 21:31.888
Love him or break               
his head open?                  

21:31.890 --> 21:34.424
Well, I'd probably              
break his head open,            

21:34.426 --> 21:35.726
but that's not                  
a fair example,                 

21:35.728 --> 21:37.527
because I'd be acting           
out of a reflex response.       

21:37.529 --> 21:38.695
What you're                     
talking about                   

21:38.697 --> 21:40.163
is a cold-blooded               
plan.                           

21:40.165 --> 21:41.898
Don't you see that's            
how violence spreads?
