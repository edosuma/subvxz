00:03.873 --> 00:05.309
- Previously
on "Good Girls"...

00:05.353 --> 00:07.007
- You better give me
that money, bitch.

00:07.050 --> 00:09.052
- Hey!

00:09.096 --> 00:10.532
- Am I gonna make it?
- Here we go.

00:10.575 --> 00:11.837
This is it.
It's go time.

00:11.881 --> 00:13.535
- You saved her leg.
- I did?

00:13.578 --> 00:15.058
- And how much of my cut
is from Cartier?

00:15.102 --> 00:16.581
- All of it.

00:16.625 --> 00:17.713
- What?

00:17.756 --> 00:19.628
How'd you get insurance
to cover it?

00:19.671 --> 00:21.151
- I tried to seduce
my therapist.

00:21.195 --> 00:22.326
He straight up rejected me.

00:22.370 --> 00:25.503
I want to get better.
- Friday at 8:30.

00:25.547 --> 00:27.853
- I couldn't make as much.
- Why is that?

00:27.897 --> 00:29.159
- The price of ink went up.

00:29.203 --> 00:30.465
- You stole from a man

00:30.508 --> 00:32.423
who blew a little girl's
brains out for fun?

00:32.467 --> 00:34.860
- 10% off the top.
- What if he finds out?

00:34.904 --> 00:36.036
- He won't.

00:37.950 --> 00:39.082
- What's it say?

00:46.394 --> 00:47.743
- You sure about this?

00:54.228 --> 00:56.317
- ♪ Well, I'm going down

00:56.360 --> 01:00.451
- ♪ Going down
a hard road ♪

01:00.495 --> 01:02.236

01:10.026 --> 01:13.116
- I think we're probably good.

01:13.160 --> 01:16.424
- What didn't I order?
- Oh, let's see.

01:16.467 --> 01:19.905
Chef's got an ambrosia salad.

01:19.949 --> 01:21.211
- Bingo.

01:25.694 --> 01:26.738
Mm.

01:31.352 --> 01:35.747

- Mm, yeah, thanks.

01:35.791 --> 01:39.751
- Cop railroaded you good, man.
- Oh, yeah.

01:39.795 --> 01:44.147
Lady Justice has got a real
Woodrow for guys like me, hmm?

01:46.280 --> 01:47.585
- Some people
at the store were happy,

01:47.629 --> 01:51.372
but they don't know you
like I do.

01:51.415 --> 01:54.244
- Who?
- Jessie.

01:54.288 --> 01:56.290

Frozen foods?

01:57.987 --> 01:59.336

02:00.685 --> 02:02.600

02:02.644 --> 02:05.777
- Seriously?
What's her problem?

02:05.821 --> 02:07.257
- She saw you do
an impression of her

02:07.301 --> 02:09.085
in front of the whole bakery.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.260
- Oh, man.

02:10.304 --> 02:13.437
Before I knew
it was a birth defect!

02:13.481 --> 02:15.396
You know what?

02:15.439 --> 02:17.267
I can't wait to get out
of this hell hole.

02:17.311 --> 02:19.269
All this woke culture.

02:19.313 --> 02:22.925
- Ambrosia salad?
- Oh, yeah.

02:22.968 --> 02:23.926
- Thanks.

02:26.233 --> 02:29.192
- Dig in.
- I'm keto now.

02:31.499 --> 02:35.198
- Oh.
Yeah, that explains it.

02:35.242 --> 02:36.808
Your fingers look more regular.

02:40.203 --> 02:42.205
- I'm really gonna
miss you, Leslie.

02:42.249 --> 02:43.815
Listen.

02:43.859 --> 02:46.296
I...

02:46.340 --> 02:49.169
I need you
to do something for me.

02:49.212 --> 02:50.735
- Name it.

02:54.913 --> 02:56.741
You look great.

02:56.785 --> 02:58.787
- You know what
they'll do to me.

02:58.830 --> 03:02.747
You've seen
the documentaries, right?

03:02.791 --> 03:05.837
- What can I do?

03:05.881 --> 03:08.579
- Your sister still
got that shop?

03:09.841 --> 03:11.887
- ♪ Come and take me home

03:11.930 --> 03:12.931

in the House and Senate?

03:53.363 --> 03:56.236
- Hmm, how many seats
on a plane, Josh?

03:56.279 --> 03:58.107
- I have no idea.
- Exactly.

03:58.150 --> 04:00.240
But you fly a lot more than
you pass bills in the Senate.

04:00.283 --> 04:02.198
Am I right?
- Right.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.460
I'm sensing
it's not the material

04:03.504 --> 04:05.462
that's been the problem here.

04:05.506 --> 04:07.464
- So do you have study buddies
over there across the pond?

04:07.508 --> 04:08.552
- Oh, you mean a quiz chap.

04:08.596 --> 04:11.033
Yeah, yeah.

04:11.076 --> 04:13.557
I've always been a lot more
chap than quiz, you know?

04:13.601 --> 04:15.603
- Hmm, right.
Next subject.

04:15.646 --> 04:17.822
- Josh Cohen.
- No.

04:17.866 --> 04:20.260
- Come on.
You know everything about me.

04:20.303 --> 04:22.305
- That's how this works.
All you, no me.

04:22.349 --> 04:24.046
- Just, like, one little crumb.

04:24.089 --> 04:26.962
Your middle name.
Twitter name.

04:27.005 --> 04:29.399
Porn name?

04:29.443 --> 04:32.402
- Huh, is that pineapple?

04:37.668 --> 04:40.628
- That was mine.
- I just wanted a bite.

04:40.671 --> 04:43.631
- Of my pizza.
There are four other slices.

04:43.674 --> 04:46.198
- Well, I didn't want
a whole piece.

04:46.242 --> 04:49.811
- Yeah, but my mouth
touched that one.

04:49.854 --> 04:53.597
- I'm not following.
- Your mouth touched my mouth.

04:53.641 --> 04:56.426
- I just wanted
to try the pineapple.

04:56.470 --> 04:58.776
- We just kissed, my friend.

04:58.820 --> 05:01.997
- We certainly did not.
- Oh, it is not so certain.

05:06.480 --> 05:09.483
- We should do chemistry.
- Aren't we?

05:12.355 --> 05:16.620
- Never mind.
- Okay, Doc.

05:16.664 --> 05:19.319
You know, you could talk about
transference all you want,

05:19.362 --> 05:23.714
but you just pizza transferred
your tongue into my mouth.

05:23.758 --> 05:25.150
Hard.

05:25.194 --> 05:27.327
And I don't think it was just
about the pineapple.

05:29.938 --> 05:32.288
- I think we're
done for tonight.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.334
- Mm-hmm.

05:34.377 --> 05:36.336
You're the best quiz chap
I ever had.

05:50.959 --> 05:55.050
- Hmm.
Do we look any different?

05:55.093 --> 05:57.792
- Better.

05:57.835 --> 05:59.184
- Older.

05:59.228 --> 06:02.536
- Sexier.
both:

06:04.146 --> 06:05.495
- Happy almost anniversary.

06:05.539 --> 06:08.585
- Oh.
- What, now look at this.

06:08.629 --> 06:10.413
- Toaster's broken.
Had to microwave them.

06:10.457 --> 06:12.589
- Mm.
- Mm.

06:12.633 --> 06:15.200
- Harry tried to write a poem
about famous marriages.

06:15.244 --> 06:16.245
- Where is that animal?

06:16.288 --> 06:17.464
- It started
with Bert and Ernie,

06:17.507 --> 06:19.248
and then he went back to sleep.

06:19.291 --> 06:21.859
- Okay, well, we feel loved.

06:21.903 --> 06:23.774
But go wake him up.
Get ready for school.

06:23.818 --> 06:25.559
- Thanks, baby.
- Yeah.

06:28.213 --> 06:31.608
- So what do you wanna do?

06:31.652 --> 06:33.218
- What do you mean?

06:33.262 --> 06:36.265
- Sara said she would babysit
if we wanna go out.

06:36.308 --> 06:40.051
- You trust that child
in our house all alone?

06:40.095 --> 06:43.403
- Okay, so here's
what it is, all right?

06:43.446 --> 06:44.491
I'm gonna rent a Bentley.

06:44.534 --> 06:45.709
- Oh, really?
- Uh-huh.

06:45.753 --> 06:48.320
Convertible, ostrich seats.
- Okay.

06:48.364 --> 06:50.061
- And I'ma drive you up
to Birmingham,

06:50.105 --> 06:52.803
and we're gonna go have dinner
at the Townsend Hotel.

06:52.847 --> 06:53.891
Hmm?

06:53.935 --> 06:55.284
I think that's the place
they got the,

06:55.327 --> 06:57.504
the bourbon that
nobody can get.

06:57.547 --> 06:59.810
Like 70 bucks a glass.
Smells like a forest fire.

06:59.854 --> 07:02.291
- Mm.
- We're gonna get that.

07:02.334 --> 07:05.860
And then when the check comes,
I'ma charge it to the room.

07:05.903 --> 07:07.731
- Oh, we're getting a room now?

07:07.775 --> 07:10.212
- We're gonna get not a room.
Presidential suite.

07:10.255 --> 07:11.387
- Ooh.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.259
- And then, wake up,
breakfast in bed.

07:14.303 --> 07:15.696
Home to the kids by noon.

07:20.657 --> 07:24.444
- You can't afford any of that.

07:24.487 --> 07:25.880
But we deserve it.

07:29.187 --> 07:34.105
- Let's just go halfsies
on the new hot water heater.

07:34.149 --> 07:37.761
- Hmm, nothing like
a good, hot shower.

07:42.549 --> 07:45.987
I gotta work anyway.

07:46.030 --> 07:47.815
- Yeah, same.

07:51.558 --> 07:54.430
- What if we
turn it lengthwise?

07:54.474 --> 07:57.128
- It's a square, Annie.
- Is it?

07:57.172 --> 08:00.567
Or is it...

08:00.610 --> 08:02.917
A diamond.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.962
- Okay.

08:05.006 --> 08:07.138
- Take it easy
on my floors, okay?

08:07.182 --> 08:11.012
- I need the practice.
- They're all she has left.

08:11.055 --> 08:15.669
- So what are we gonna do here?
- I made a to-do list.

08:15.712 --> 08:17.540
- That is a battle cry
if I ever heard one.

08:17.584 --> 08:19.760
She means business.

08:19.803 --> 08:21.109
- Yo, Murderball.

08:21.152 --> 08:23.198
You wanna park it
and join the conversation?

08:23.241 --> 08:24.678
- I hear you just fine.

08:26.941 --> 08:29.509
- Number one.

08:29.552 --> 08:32.599
Gain back his trust.
- How?

08:34.339 --> 08:38.822
- ♪ Softly

08:38.866 --> 08:41.869

08:50.704 --> 08:51.922
- What's number two?

08:53.533 --> 08:55.665
- Get a cut of the money.

08:55.709 --> 09:00.235
No skimming, no stealing.
We'll just earn it.

09:00.278 --> 09:01.541

I think we should just
leave them there.

09:25.521 --> 09:27.218
- Forever?

09:27.262 --> 09:29.699
- Well, until
we figure this out.

09:29.743 --> 09:32.049
Where are you going?

09:32.093 --> 09:35.749
- I am going
to get our lives back.

09:35.792 --> 09:37.794
- Well, you gotta look
that good to do it?

09:41.798 --> 09:43.234
- You trust me?

10:00.774 --> 10:02.514
Excuse me.

10:14.091 --> 10:16.441
- Shouldn't you be
making my money?

10:16.485 --> 10:18.356
- Just here having a drink.

10:21.664 --> 10:24.101
Questions, notes, comments?

10:24.145 --> 10:25.973
- So in sum,

10:26.016 --> 10:29.019
we suck up to the gang leader
who we stole from,

10:29.063 --> 10:31.935
and convince him
to pay us a living wage?

10:31.979 --> 10:35.678
- Which we then use
to pay someone else

10:35.722 --> 10:37.767
to blow his brains out?

10:39.203 --> 10:42.119
- A professional.

10:42.163 --> 10:44.644
Not someone who's gonna
wet himself in my car.

10:46.471 --> 10:47.647
It's all I could come up with

10:47.690 --> 10:49.866
at 4:00 a.m.
on an air mattress.

10:54.349 --> 10:55.698
- Max has that cousin.

10:58.788 --> 11:00.790
- Makes sense on paper.

11:00.834 --> 11:02.270
- Rough day?

11:02.313 --> 11:05.969
- Mm, I've had better.

11:06.013 --> 11:08.711
- Yeah, well, nothing
a good night's sleep won't fix.

11:08.755 --> 11:12.323
- I'd have to have a bed.
- That's a problem.

11:12.367 --> 11:14.935
- Well, the least of them.
- That right?

11:17.938 --> 11:21.202
- I screwed up with my boss.
- Never good.

11:24.031 --> 11:26.294
- I'm still valuable,
though, and he knows it.

11:27.904 --> 11:29.819
And I only did it because
he works me to the bone

11:29.863 --> 11:31.691
and doesn't pay me anything.

11:31.734 --> 11:33.301
- What do you want, Elizabeth?

11:35.129 --> 11:38.610
- Just what's fair.
- Ah, fair.

11:40.743 --> 11:42.005
Yeah, I don't owe you.

11:42.049 --> 11:44.094
It's the other way
around, remember?

11:45.792 --> 11:49.578
- Can't we just go back?

11:49.621 --> 11:53.190
- Well, that's up to you.

11:53.234 --> 11:56.280
- What do you mean?
- Yeah, you gotta earn that.

11:59.109 --> 12:00.241
- Okay.

12:06.900 --> 12:10.338
- Yeah?
- I'll do anything.

12:13.689 --> 12:17.998
- Anything, huh?
- Within reason.

12:26.136 --> 12:30.271
- You still got that minivan?

12:30.314 --> 12:32.360
- Why?

12:32.403 --> 12:34.101
- I might got something
for you.

12:34.144 --> 12:38.018
- My ottoman?

12:38.061 --> 12:41.848
NO.

12:47.288 --> 12:49.594
Hey, where are my keys?

12:49.638 --> 12:52.075
- How would I know?
- You know where everything is.

12:52.119 --> 12:54.861
- Look in the fridge.
- I'm not an idiot.

12:54.904 --> 12:57.167
Oh, and Dad is gonna pick
you up from school today.

12:57.211 --> 12:59.866
I have some errands to run.

12:59.909 --> 13:02.172
- Why'd you get in so late?

13:02.216 --> 13:04.827
- I was in therapy.

13:04.871 --> 13:07.438
- At 10:00 at night?
- Well, yeah, it was GED prep.

13:07.482 --> 13:08.831
You know, it's--

13:08.875 --> 13:11.791
Oh, by the way, there's pizza
for you for lunch.

13:11.834 --> 13:14.010
- You had pizza
with your therapist?

13:14.054 --> 13:16.230
- And a couple beers.
So what?

13:16.273 --> 13:18.493
- He's your therapist.
- He's helping me.

13:18.536 --> 13:20.538
It's like a,
like a study buddy.

13:20.582 --> 13:22.845
- Like your last study buddy?
- Okay.

13:22.889 --> 13:24.760
- But instead
of passing dummy algebra,

13:24.804 --> 13:26.544
he got you knocked up with me.

13:26.588 --> 13:28.677
- Have a great day
at school, okay?

13:28.720 --> 13:31.201
- You had to drop out.
Got married, divorced--

13:31.245 --> 13:33.073
- Love you.

13:33.116 --> 13:34.988
- And here we are.

13:46.347 --> 13:48.566
- This does not make you right
about everything, okay?

13:50.307 --> 13:53.833
- Love you.
- Bye.

13:53.876 --> 13:55.704
- I mean, that's
what it has to be.

13:55.747 --> 13:57.445
'Cause we've already
delivered his drugs,

13:57.488 --> 13:58.663
his money, his bodies.

13:58.707 --> 14:00.100
- She even boned him,
for God's sakes.

14:00.143 --> 14:01.797
- What does that have
to do with anything?

14:01.841 --> 14:03.973
- And if he's trying to punish
us, which he most certainly is,

14:04.017 --> 14:06.410
what is the one thing
we're all against?

14:06.454 --> 14:09.936
- Microplastics in the ocean.
- Okay, the one other thing.

14:09.979 --> 14:11.415
- The Rohingya crisis
in Myanmar.

14:11.459 --> 14:14.157
- It's the GED.
She's trying to be up on stuff.

14:14.201 --> 14:15.724
- Okay, why did we
march downtown

14:15.767 --> 14:17.987
for three hours
in the rain last year?

14:18.031 --> 14:20.337
- With the vagina hats on?
- That was for women, Annie.

14:20.381 --> 14:21.773
We're not against women.

14:21.817 --> 14:24.298
- What is every
sane person against?

14:24.341 --> 14:25.647
- Oh.
both: Guns.

14:25.690 --> 14:27.779
- Genetic cloning.
- Oh, I give up, I can't.

14:27.823 --> 14:29.172
- Listen, it doesn't matter
what it is.

14:29.216 --> 14:31.392
If we wanna get rid of him,
we're gonna do it.

14:31.435 --> 14:33.089
- How do we even know
we're in the right place?

14:33.133 --> 14:34.699
- Because the pin thingy
dropped here.

14:34.743 --> 14:37.659
- It is a weird place
to deliver a bunch of guns.

14:37.702 --> 14:39.269
- Maybe they're coming
by helicopter.

14:39.313 --> 14:40.923
- Yeah, or some kind of drone.

14:40.967 --> 14:42.882
- For all we know,
there could be a full convoy

14:42.925 --> 14:44.274
barreling down the road.

14:44.318 --> 14:46.407
- Nope.
Right up there.

14:47.974 --> 14:50.063
- Are you high?
- That's a commercial flight.

14:50.106 --> 14:51.238
- Exactly.

14:51.281 --> 14:53.327
Smart.
Hiding in plain sight.

14:55.198 --> 14:58.898
- You think they're gonna land
a 747 in a wheat field?

14:58.941 --> 15:01.726
- No, a cabbage field.
See, there's way more water.

15:01.770 --> 15:04.033
You know, it's like when
they spray foam on the runway.

15:04.077 --> 15:05.643
You know, it creates--
- For crashing.

15:05.687 --> 15:07.515
- Exactly, but the package
still gets there

15:07.558 --> 15:08.472
whether you crash the--

15:08.516 --> 15:10.126
- Annie Bananey?

15:20.615 --> 15:23.270
Annie Bananey!

15:25.663 --> 15:26.969
Well...

15:28.797 --> 15:30.973
Where do we go?
Let's get going.

15:31.017 --> 15:34.237
This is the car.
Same car, I see.

15:34.281 --> 15:36.326
You might have
to throw down some towels.

15:52.995 --> 15:55.955
- I mean.
- I know.

15:55.998 --> 15:57.782
- I would have preferred guns.

15:57.826 --> 16:00.046
- Grenades.
Cruise missiles.

16:00.089 --> 16:01.221
- Anything else.

16:01.264 --> 16:03.223
- And what is up
with the living hell

16:03.266 --> 16:05.051
that is etched
all over his face?

16:05.094 --> 16:06.966
- No, it's like
you can't do neo-Nazi

16:07.009 --> 16:08.793
with Santeria and voodoo.

16:08.837 --> 16:10.795
It sends a totally
mixed message.

16:10.839 --> 16:12.972
- It makes sense actually.

16:13.015 --> 16:14.974
- Dude, nothing
on that face makes sense.

16:15.017 --> 16:18.455
- No, I mean the assignment.

16:18.499 --> 16:20.675
'Cause we couldn't take care
of Boomer before,

16:20.718 --> 16:22.372
so now he's gonna
take care of it.

16:22.416 --> 16:24.374
- Why didn't he just have
somebody do it in prison?

16:24.418 --> 16:25.506
- I mean, you know he's got

16:25.549 --> 16:26.811
a whole network
of killers in there.

16:26.855 --> 16:29.118
- Because he is testing us.

16:29.162 --> 16:32.687
If we deliver this "package,"
then we're back in.

16:35.864 --> 16:38.606
- Oh, God.

16:38.649 --> 16:40.738
- Oh, they're looking for him.

16:40.782 --> 16:42.392
- Hang a U-ey.

16:42.436 --> 16:44.046
- Don't hang anything.

16:44.090 --> 16:46.614
- Then what are we gonna say?
- That we didn't see anyone.

16:46.657 --> 16:48.181
- What if they wonder
why we're out here?

16:48.224 --> 16:51.053
- Just three moms out
for the day antiquing.

16:51.097 --> 16:52.228
- Ew.

16:52.272 --> 16:54.839
- What would you like us
to fake be doing?

16:54.883 --> 16:56.276
- Berry picking.

16:56.319 --> 16:57.668
- Fine.
- Way more believable.

16:57.712 --> 16:59.366
- It's berry season.

17:05.676 --> 17:08.505
- Hi, Officer.
- Afternoon, ladies.

17:08.549 --> 17:10.029
- What's going on here?

17:10.072 --> 17:11.552
- Some inmate started
a fire this morning

17:11.595 --> 17:12.814
at Saginaw Correctional.

17:12.857 --> 17:13.989
- Oh, my God.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.382
- Yeah, it's still
a mess up there.

17:15.425 --> 17:16.992
They think a few guys
may have jumped the wall,

17:17.036 --> 17:18.254
so just taking precautions.

17:18.298 --> 17:21.518
- Jeez, well
we appreciate it, Officer.

17:34.749 --> 17:37.012
- Your kid's an Arctic Grizzly?

17:37.056 --> 17:40.581
- Travel team.
Schedule's brutal.

17:40.624 --> 17:42.104
- My son's a Bay City Penguin.

17:42.148 --> 17:43.845
- Oh, my gosh.
That's so funny.

17:43.888 --> 17:45.281
We're playing you
in the semi-finals.

17:45.325 --> 17:48.110
I'm Beth, by the way.
Kenny Boland's mom.

17:53.594 --> 17:54.812
- We'll see you on the ice.

18:17.618 --> 18:20.273
Oh, it is hot in there.

18:21.883 --> 18:26.105
Wait a minute.
That sign is in dollars.

18:26.148 --> 18:28.324
- Well, yeah.
What did you expect?

18:28.368 --> 18:31.936
- Loonies.
- What are you talking about?

18:31.980 --> 18:33.851
- You're supposed
to smuggle me to Canada.

18:33.895 --> 18:36.506
- Says who?
- Your gang leader.

18:36.550 --> 18:38.987
- Okay, first of all,
he's not our gang leader, and--

18:39.030 --> 18:41.163
- His guy on the inside said
that if I lit the fire,

18:41.207 --> 18:43.948
my debt would be paid,
and he'd get me to Canada.

18:45.907 --> 18:47.822
Why?
What did he tell you?

18:51.956 --> 18:54.220
- Same thing.
- Oh.

18:54.263 --> 18:56.265
- We just thought
you'd wanna pee first.

18:59.703 --> 19:01.444
Ooh.

19:01.488 --> 19:03.620
Well, man, I wish you would've
asked me five minutes ago

19:03.664 --> 19:06.623
because it's a mess in here.

19:06.667 --> 19:08.886
- Oh, Jesus.

19:08.930 --> 19:11.150
- You know what, though?
I am super horny.

19:11.193 --> 19:14.196
Let me just...

19:17.678 --> 19:18.809
- Oh, my God.
- Back--

19:18.853 --> 19:20.071
- Ugh.
- Back in a jiff.

19:20.115 --> 19:22.117
- Unbelievable.

19:31.344 --> 19:34.434
- That is deeply stupid.
- It's Boomer.

19:34.477 --> 19:36.566
- Talk about a lamb
to slaughter.

19:38.351 --> 19:40.004
- To be clear--
- I know, I know.

19:40.048 --> 19:43.878
- This is not Mary's
fuzzy, cute, little lamb.

19:43.921 --> 19:48.448
- It's a dirty, mangy, feral--

19:48.491 --> 19:51.755
- Serial raping lamb.

19:51.799 --> 19:54.193
- If anyone deserves it...

19:54.236 --> 19:56.543
- Sorry it took so long.

19:56.586 --> 19:58.545
I've been in solitary
the past few weeks.

19:58.588 --> 20:00.721
- Jesus, why?
What did you do?

20:00.764 --> 20:03.593
- Well, it was more
what was being done to me.

20:03.637 --> 20:05.465
- Can we please go?

20:05.508 --> 20:07.554
- I needed time to heal.
- All right.

20:07.597 --> 20:10.165
- They wanted to make sure I
could pass a solid, you know--

20:10.209 --> 20:12.428
- Let's get back in the bag.
- Come on, move it.

20:12.472 --> 20:14.038
Oh, I need a favor.

20:17.346 --> 20:18.826
- Are you kidding?

20:18.869 --> 20:21.263
- Look, since
we're still stateside,

20:21.307 --> 20:23.787
I wanna see Nana real quick.

20:23.831 --> 20:26.312
- With that face?
You'll kill her.

20:26.355 --> 20:28.270
- We're all going to
Saskatchewan in a grain truck.

20:28.314 --> 20:31.491
I may never see her again.
And she's getting up there.

20:31.534 --> 20:33.754
- Call her from the road.

20:33.797 --> 20:37.192
- She's in a nursing home.
- Wait, what?

20:37.236 --> 20:40.630
Since when?
- She had a bad fall.

20:40.674 --> 20:43.111
- Well, what happened?
- I don't know.

20:43.154 --> 20:46.941
No one was taking care of her.
I was locked up.

20:46.984 --> 20:48.116
- No.

20:50.640 --> 20:54.688
- He should say goodbye to her.
- No.

20:54.731 --> 20:57.081
- She should say goodbye
to him.

20:57.125 --> 20:58.996
- We have a job
to finish, Annie.

20:59.040 --> 21:01.869
- And you-know-who
is not gonna wait.

21:01.912 --> 21:04.567
- Manolo's good people.
He'll wait, right?

21:05.916 --> 21:10.530
He's solid.
He's a solid dude.

21:10.573 --> 21:13.576
- It is her last chance.

21:18.842 --> 21:22.237
One hour.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.891
Thank you.

21:23.934 --> 21:26.110
- All right, back in the bag.
Go on.

21:31.812 --> 21:33.944
- Deeply stupid.

21:38.253 --> 21:39.994
- You can't just
barge in here, okay?

21:40.037 --> 21:41.909
Why don't you ask that prick
where he put his hands?

21:41.952 --> 21:44.128
'Cause by the way,
he fully knew the rules.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.309
- What's up, y'all?
- Do you mind staying outside?

21:50.352 --> 21:51.962
- Hey.

21:52.006 --> 21:54.922
Wait, are you sixth precinct?

21:54.965 --> 21:57.577
I was 13th.
- 13?

21:57.620 --> 21:59.318
Is that O'Brien?
Is he the captain there?

21:59.361 --> 22:01.450
- Well, I heard he retired.

22:01.494 --> 22:02.930
- I went to academy
with his son.

22:02.973 --> 22:05.106
- Oh, great cop.

22:05.149 --> 22:06.237
- Will you please tell this guy

22:06.281 --> 22:07.761
he can't just go
through our stuff?

22:07.804 --> 22:09.197
- What's the problem, man?

22:09.240 --> 22:11.199
- Dude said his wife's
earrings got stolen

22:11.242 --> 22:12.983
at some birthday party.

22:13.027 --> 22:14.985
- Don't you need, like,
a warrant or something?

22:15.029 --> 22:17.553
- Well, that's really not how
it works for girls like you.

22:21.383 --> 22:23.646
- Why don't you bitches
take a seat?

22:25.039 --> 22:28.347
- All right, all right.
Thank you, but I got this.

22:28.390 --> 22:30.610
- Yeah, well, if you need some
help searching those lockers,

22:30.653 --> 22:31.785
man, I'm happy to help.

22:31.828 --> 22:33.700
- Stan--
- I said sit your ass down.

22:36.703 --> 22:38.966
They're over there.

22:39.009 --> 22:41.272
- You have a key?
- Oh.

22:43.840 --> 22:46.277
Here you go.

22:52.849 --> 22:54.895
Now I gotta tell you,
I was at that party,

22:54.938 --> 22:57.376
and there were some
super shady people, so...

23:09.388 --> 23:11.955
- Just keep an eye on them.
- Yeah.

23:15.394 --> 23:18.092
- Why'd you leave the 13th?
- Oh, my man.

23:18.135 --> 23:19.615
You know, the pay isn't
what it used to be.

23:19.659 --> 23:20.877
- Tell me about it.

23:20.921 --> 23:22.444
- Downside here is, what?
A heel to the face.

23:25.316 --> 23:26.448
Hey, listen.

23:26.492 --> 23:27.884
If you or any of the boys
wanna come down,

23:27.928 --> 23:29.495
I'll hook you up
with some bottle service.

23:29.538 --> 23:31.366
- Yeah?
- Yeah, man.

23:31.410 --> 23:32.715
- Appreciate that.
- You got it, man.

23:32.759 --> 23:34.064
All right.

23:40.636 --> 23:43.073
- What the hell was that?

23:43.117 --> 23:45.206
- That was me throwing him
off the trail.

23:45.249 --> 23:47.338
- Our entire haul from
last night is in these lockers.

23:47.382 --> 23:51.560
- You know what?
From now on, nothing but cash.

23:51.604 --> 23:53.257
- I don't need it.
- Okay.

23:56.260 --> 23:58.219
- Maybe we should just cool it
for a while.

24:00.482 --> 24:03.529
- What do you mean?
- We almost got arrested, Stan.

24:03.572 --> 24:05.531
- I can't do that.

24:05.574 --> 24:08.098
- Well, I can't go to jail.

24:21.503 --> 24:24.288
Ruby and I, we're gonna
be married for 22 years

24:24.332 --> 24:26.247
this Saturday.

24:26.290 --> 24:30.207
- Is that the diamond one
or platinum?

24:30.251 --> 24:33.080
- She wants a water heater.
- Hmm.

24:33.123 --> 24:35.125
I think it might be leather.

24:35.169 --> 24:36.736
- Yeah, I'm not gonna
give my wife an appliance

24:36.779 --> 24:39.260
for our anniversary.

24:39.303 --> 24:41.305
- As long as you got our backs.

24:44.657 --> 24:45.962
- You know I do.

24:47.573 --> 24:50.663
- Hi, what room is
Marion Petersen in?

24:50.706 --> 24:53.622
I'm her grandson, Leslie.

24:53.666 --> 24:55.450
- Let me call you back.

24:58.801 --> 25:00.977
- He's asking where
the package is.

25:01.021 --> 25:03.066
- We're not Amazon Prime.

25:05.504 --> 25:08.463
- How long is this gonna take?
- Just tell him it's en route.

25:10.726 --> 25:13.163
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

25:15.992 --> 25:17.907
What do we do?

25:20.170 --> 25:21.215
What do we do?
- I don't know.

25:21.258 --> 25:22.303
- Do we stay?
- I don't know.

25:22.346 --> 25:24.827
- Should we run?

25:32.705 --> 25:35.534
- What is going on?

25:35.577 --> 25:37.971
- She's dead.

25:38.014 --> 25:40.408
A week ago.
In her sleep.

25:48.982 --> 25:50.505
- I'm sorry.

25:50.549 --> 25:53.552
In a place where 2/3
of the residents can't walk,

25:53.595 --> 25:56.555
you put the ramp 1/2 mile away
from the main entrance?

26:00.820 --> 26:04.214
What'd I miss?

26:06.086 --> 26:07.783
Where Nana at?

26:23.625 --> 26:27.890
- She lied, Annie.
- For months.

26:27.934 --> 26:31.459
- And she chose him over you.

26:31.502 --> 26:35.158
- And she's kind of racist.
- She's mostly racist.

26:35.202 --> 26:39.598
- She was here because
she fell on ice.

26:39.641 --> 26:43.863
- So?
- She was going to the salon.

26:43.906 --> 26:46.648
- It could have
happened anywhere.

26:46.692 --> 26:48.998
- I used to take her there.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.660
- All right.
- Okay.

26:58.704 --> 27:00.183
- Let's roll.

27:02.533 --> 27:04.318
Hold Nana, would you?

27:06.189 --> 27:07.234
She always liked you.

27:09.018 --> 27:11.717
Here.
- What's this?

27:11.760 --> 27:14.633
- Her final wish.

27:20.421 --> 27:22.292
- Lake Okoboji?

27:22.336 --> 27:26.166
- Yeah, that's where
she wants to be scattered.

27:26.209 --> 27:28.472
By the waterfall.
- That's beautiful.

27:28.516 --> 27:30.126
- That's three hours away.

27:30.170 --> 27:31.737
- It's where she married
Grandpa John.

27:31.780 --> 27:33.695
- We don't have time
for this, okay?

27:33.739 --> 27:35.697
- No, I gotta see it through.
- Look.

27:35.741 --> 27:37.612
She's a wonderful lady
and whatever,

27:37.656 --> 27:39.396
but we gotta get you to--

27:39.440 --> 27:40.702
- Canada.
- Yeah, right.

27:40.746 --> 27:42.965
- I'm not going.

27:43.009 --> 27:44.837
- Yeah, you are.
- No, I'm not.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.273
- We don't answer to you.

27:46.316 --> 27:48.405
- Yeah, we answer to someone
way scarier than you.

27:48.449 --> 27:50.843
- Why does that guy
give a turd where I go, huh?

28:02.115 --> 28:03.725
You know what?

28:03.769 --> 28:05.771
Thanks for the ride.
You're off the hook.

28:05.814 --> 28:07.120
- Uh-uh.
No way.

28:07.163 --> 28:10.210
- Annie, I dig your new hair.
- Not really new.

28:10.253 --> 28:13.604
- Well, I like that you
let the roots grow out.

28:13.648 --> 28:16.695
Hey, hey.
- Beth.

28:16.738 --> 28:18.087
- Hey.
Turn off the child locks.

28:18.131 --> 28:21.177
- Beth, what are you doing?
- Give me Nana back!

28:22.918 --> 28:24.267
- Get back in the bag.

28:26.748 --> 28:30.404
- No, don't.
- Get back in the bag, Boomer.

28:32.145 --> 28:34.582
- If we didn't have
enough reasons to go to hell.

28:34.625 --> 28:38.455
- I swear to God this will be
her final resting place.

28:38.499 --> 28:40.066
- Beth, don't!

28:40.109 --> 28:43.678
- Oh, she's gonna go so well
with all this old people stuff.

28:43.722 --> 28:44.940
- Please--

28:44.984 --> 28:48.161
- Leftover prunes,
lots of wound care,

28:48.204 --> 28:50.816
and honestly,
I don't know if this goo is

28:50.859 --> 28:53.775
from sponge baths
or just straight up phlegm.

28:53.819 --> 28:55.429
- No!
- Don't!

28:55.472 --> 28:58.824
- You will never be able
to siphon her out of this ooze.

29:04.830 --> 29:09.008
- Okay.
Okay, okay.

29:09.051 --> 29:12.185
Okay.

29:12.228 --> 29:14.970
- Put him in.

29:18.147 --> 29:20.236
- We're not going
to Canada, are we?

29:42.432 --> 29:45.914
- What's going on
with you and my mom?

29:45.958 --> 29:47.786
- Sorry, who are you?

29:47.829 --> 29:51.224
- How many other moms
see a kid shrink?

29:51.267 --> 29:54.836
- Oh.
Hello, Ben.

29:54.880 --> 29:57.143
- She thinks you care
about her.

29:59.319 --> 30:03.062
- I, um--

30:05.151 --> 30:06.935
I care about all my patients.

30:06.979 --> 30:09.720
- So you drink beer
late at night with all of them?

30:09.764 --> 30:12.549
- Well, most are in bed
by 8:00, so--

30:12.593 --> 30:14.638
- Maybe you haven't gotten to
this part in your sessions yet

30:14.682 --> 30:16.553
or whatever, but let me
break it down for you.

30:16.597 --> 30:18.294
She's really into you, okay?

30:18.338 --> 30:21.254
Like, the only reason
she's doing any of this stuff

30:21.297 --> 30:24.431
is, like, to impress you
or something.

30:24.474 --> 30:26.868
- Okay, look, it's natural
to worry about your mom--

30:26.912 --> 30:29.436
- I just know her.

30:29.479 --> 30:31.917
- Well...

30:31.960 --> 30:34.180
Rest assured, we're trying
to work on these issues.

30:34.223 --> 30:36.486
- Okay, but when she realizes
that you're "working on issues"

30:36.530 --> 30:37.966
and not in love with her,

30:38.010 --> 30:39.881
she's gonna get in bed
for three months,

30:39.925 --> 30:41.665
eat a whole lot
of mac and cheese,

30:41.709 --> 30:43.754
stop waxing,
stop paying the bills,

30:43.798 --> 30:45.017
stop making my lunches.

30:45.060 --> 30:46.932
And forget
about this GED thing.

30:48.368 --> 30:51.240
- I, um--
I hear what you're saying.

30:52.633 --> 30:55.027
- Good, 'cause if you don't,

30:55.070 --> 30:56.898
I have ways to turn those
five star Yelp reviews

30:56.942 --> 30:59.379
into one-ers.

30:59.422 --> 31:03.774
- Yelp terrorist, eh?
- Freedom fighter.

31:03.818 --> 31:05.907
- Definitely your mom's son.

31:08.823 --> 31:10.303
Oh, but how are you
getting home?

31:10.346 --> 31:13.480
- I rode my bike.

31:37.504 --> 31:41.029
- Is this it?

31:41.073 --> 31:45.468
- Oh, God.
Oh, God.

31:45.512 --> 31:47.818
Who's got Nana?

31:47.862 --> 31:50.821
- I do.
- Sorry, who's talking?

31:50.865 --> 31:52.432
It's me, Boomer.

31:52.475 --> 31:56.566
- Annie. Annie.
You gotta listen to me, okay?

31:56.610 --> 31:57.916
I know you hate me.

31:57.959 --> 31:59.134
But I also know
you loved my Nana.

31:59.178 --> 32:01.310
- Just stop talking.

32:01.354 --> 32:03.095
- She wouldn't have made it
as long as she did without you.

32:03.138 --> 32:04.966
So I need you
to take care of her now, okay?

32:05.010 --> 32:06.881
And do what
she wanted, okay?

32:06.925 --> 32:10.276
Annie?
I need you to say "Okay."

32:10.319 --> 32:12.843
Annie, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

32:12.887 --> 32:14.976
- Hockey bag in the trunk.
- Pop it.

32:15.020 --> 32:17.544
- No, please, please.
Please, just--

32:17.587 --> 32:20.503
Please say something!
Just, anything, Annie!

32:20.547 --> 32:22.766
Waterfall, south
of the Makinac Bridge.

32:22.810 --> 32:23.985
They got married at sunset.

32:24.029 --> 32:25.291
No, please, please.

32:25.334 --> 32:27.946
Annie, I need you to promise.
Annie!

32:29.382 --> 32:33.429
Please! Oh, please.
Okay, please, please?

32:33.473 --> 32:34.865
- Stop.

32:34.909 --> 32:38.739
- Whoever is carrying me,
I'll do whatever you want.

32:38.782 --> 32:41.220
- You don't have
to do this again.

32:41.263 --> 32:45.920
- We're all good now.
- It's basic management, right?

32:45.964 --> 32:47.835
The best employee,
the most loyal,

32:47.878 --> 32:50.011
they're the ones
who get a second chance.

32:50.055 --> 32:51.621
- That's why you're back
on payroll.

32:51.665 --> 32:53.232
12% off the top.

32:54.755 --> 32:57.366
- I don't mean me.

32:57.410 --> 32:59.542
- Guys, where
are you taking me?

32:59.586 --> 33:01.675
Can someone just tell me
where you're taking me?

33:01.718 --> 33:04.895
- Oh, him.

33:04.939 --> 33:07.202
Yeah, I got
different plans for him.

33:10.989 --> 33:13.992
- Ow! Don't throw
me around, at least, okay?

33:14.035 --> 33:15.994
Could you be
a little bit more responsible?

35:05.015 --> 35:07.105

- 100%.

35:08.628 --> 35:10.934
- Wow.
- What do you think?

35:12.501 --> 35:15.330
- I think you're in over your
head at these private parties.

35:15.374 --> 35:16.288
- Try it on.

35:18.159 --> 35:20.509
- You coming up like that?
- Try it on, baby.

35:20.553 --> 35:23.643
- No.
- No?

35:23.686 --> 35:26.036
- No.
It doesn't feel right.

35:31.825 --> 35:33.348
- 'Cause that matters now?

35:33.392 --> 35:35.742
- You were just giving me grief
about how I slept at night.

35:35.785 --> 35:36.960
- So?

35:37.004 --> 35:38.179
- So why don't you
check yourself?

35:38.223 --> 35:39.833
- Excuse me?
You opened this door.

35:39.876 --> 35:43.358
- Swag money?
A professional karaoke machine?

35:43.402 --> 35:44.446
That boulder--

35:44.490 --> 35:46.100
- And then you opened it again.

35:46.144 --> 35:48.102
You opened it again, and then
you bashed down the damn wall.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.670
- One of us has to be good!
Why, hmm?

35:55.370 --> 35:57.764
- What do you mean, why?

35:57.807 --> 35:59.331
- All my life,
I've been swimming upstream.

35:59.374 --> 36:00.332
Fighting it.

36:00.375 --> 36:02.072
And you know what
that gets you?

36:02.116 --> 36:05.902
That doesn't get you respect.
It doesn't get you a badge.

36:05.946 --> 36:08.035
It doesn't get you
a proper wedding ring.

36:08.078 --> 36:10.559
It just gets you tired.

36:10.603 --> 36:13.823
And then you get washed
right back down again.

36:16.391 --> 36:18.872
- Baby, I'm not wearing that.

36:21.701 --> 36:23.790
- I'm not returning it.

36:23.833 --> 36:25.400

36:39.632 --> 36:41.721
- Hmm.
Anything on my teeth?

36:43.940 --> 36:47.683
- Is that important?
- Very.

36:47.727 --> 36:49.946
- Okay, well then,
a little right here.

36:49.990 --> 36:52.558
- Here?

36:52.601 --> 36:54.081
Good looking out, Tim-ster.

36:57.737 --> 37:00.261
- Annie.
- Ah.

37:00.305 --> 37:01.697
Wish me luck.

37:01.741 --> 37:03.482
Hey, so we can totally skip
the rest of government

37:03.525 --> 37:05.353
because I watched this
mini-series last night

37:05.397 --> 37:08.008
on John Adams, which was way
too long and extremely boring.

37:08.051 --> 37:12.491
But it pretty much...
Covered everything.

37:12.534 --> 37:15.363
Sorry, did I get
the wrong time?

37:15.407 --> 37:16.364
- Before we get started,

37:16.408 --> 37:18.148
I wanted to introduce you
to Lila.

37:18.192 --> 37:21.761
- Hello.
- What's up?

37:21.804 --> 37:24.372
- Lila's a teacher.
- Sixth grade.

37:24.416 --> 37:27.375
- Very cool.

37:27.419 --> 37:29.682
- And she's also American,
so she has a much firmer grasp

37:29.725 --> 37:31.858
on your people's
sordid history.

37:31.901 --> 37:33.512
both:

37:33.555 --> 37:34.991
- Oh, and by the way,

37:35.035 --> 37:36.863
I think it's awesome that
you're getting your diploma.

37:36.906 --> 37:38.952
- Oh, thanks.

37:38.995 --> 37:40.954
- It's never too late.

37:45.480 --> 37:48.091
- I thought you could use
a real tutor.

37:48.135 --> 37:50.398
- I thought we were
making progress.

37:50.442 --> 37:52.792
- Well, it's better this way.
Don't you think?

37:54.184 --> 37:56.361
- I don't know what to think.

38:12.290 --> 38:13.334
All right, why don't we start

38:13.378 --> 38:14.770
with what's
bothering you today?

Just have to put them together.

I figured the kids could do it
when they get back.

38:34.007 --> 38:36.444
Getting a jump, huh?

38:36.488 --> 38:37.576

who yelled at us

38:46.149 --> 38:48.151

- We got sitter-shamed.
- Uh-huh.

38:50.371 --> 38:53.156
We should shut down
more bars together.

38:53.200 --> 38:55.202
Like, in general.
- Yeah.

38:55.245 --> 38:57.030

last time I had that much fun.

39:02.165 --> 39:05.212
- And you wore jeans.

39:07.606 --> 39:09.825
- So?

39:09.869 --> 39:12.132
- It wasn't that dress.

39:14.177 --> 39:16.266
- I didn't need anything
from you.

39:18.704 --> 39:20.619
- I really wish you did.

39:27.147 --> 39:29.367
- It's just a dress, Dean.

39:33.414 --> 39:35.634
- Well, I'll start
