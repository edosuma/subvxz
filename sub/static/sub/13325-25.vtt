WEBVTT

00:01.735 --> 00:03.335
We still have
a few minutes left.

00:03.337 --> 00:05.671
Lacey, didn't you
have some kind of a big
test at work?

00:05.673 --> 00:07.573
Yeah, and I totally
aced it.

00:07.575 --> 00:09.541
I'm officially
allowed to sell drugs.

00:09.543 --> 00:12.444
Welcome aboard.

00:12.446 --> 00:15.047
Tomorrow's my first day
representing

00:15.049 --> 00:16.582
Galaxy-payson
pharmaceuticals.

00:16.584 --> 00:19.418
They also make peanut butter
and nuclear submarines,

00:19.420 --> 00:21.720
But I'm not licensed
to sell those.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.789
Well, they do have to worry
about national security.

00:23.791 --> 00:27.192
You don't want peanut butter
to fall into the wrong hands.

00:27.194 --> 00:30.696
So, you aced your test
with ease, huh?

00:30.698 --> 00:32.731
<i>Which one did</i>
<i>you cheat off of?</i>

00:32.733 --> 00:36.035
Chinese? Japanese?

00:36.037 --> 00:38.570
Vietnamese?
( laughs )

00:38.572 --> 00:40.572
Excuse me,
I did not cheat.

00:40.574 --> 00:42.808
I just double-checked
my answers with somebody else's

00:42.810 --> 00:44.176
Before writing them down.

00:44.178 --> 00:47.079
So you didn't cheat?

00:47.081 --> 00:48.747
But it does
sound like you--

00:48.749 --> 00:51.450
What's the right word?
--Cheated.

00:51.452 --> 00:55.721
Okay, but there's
only one test that
I really need to pass.

00:55.723 --> 00:58.090
How much of this crap
can I sell?

00:58.092 --> 01:00.125
And I think
I'm gonna do okay

01:00.127 --> 01:01.260
Because in case you
haven't noticed,

01:01.262 --> 01:04.163
I'm superhot.

01:04.165 --> 01:06.598
You still have to know
your products.

01:06.600 --> 01:07.633
I do.

01:07.635 --> 01:12.671
Give me the chemical name,
class and major side effects

01:12.673 --> 01:14.807
Of even one of the drugs
you're selling.

01:14.809 --> 01:17.109
Anti...

01:17.111 --> 01:19.611
Dexta...

01:19.613 --> 01:21.346
Metho...

01:21.348 --> 01:23.482
Ooh, I dropped something.

01:23.484 --> 01:27.619
So how many boxes
of proloft do you want?

01:28.822 --> 01:30.856
<i>( alarm beeping )</i>

01:30.858 --> 01:33.659
- This is it!
- <i>( alarm stops )</i>

01:33.661 --> 01:35.694
Sorry, charlie.
I just finished
hooking things up

01:35.696 --> 01:37.729
And I was testing
the alarm system.

01:37.731 --> 01:40.265
No problem.
This is monica,
my it person.

01:40.267 --> 01:42.534
Ed, what did you think
that was?

01:42.536 --> 01:44.837
I don't know.
I thought it was
just a fire.

01:44.839 --> 01:48.407
Or a race war.

01:48.409 --> 01:51.543
No, no, ed.
My race war alarm sounds
totally different.

01:54.514 --> 01:56.515
So you hooked up
my alarm to my cell phone?

01:56.517 --> 01:58.150
And I did
some other stuff, too.

01:58.152 --> 02:00.352
Now you can run your whole
house from wherever you are.

02:00.354 --> 02:02.521
Your tv, your lights,
your thermostat.

02:02.523 --> 02:04.423
You can turn on your oven
from your car.

02:04.425 --> 02:07.159
- How cool is that?
- That is very cool.

02:07.161 --> 02:08.861
I can't tell you how many
times I'm stuck in traffic

02:08.863 --> 02:12.231
Thinking, "oh, no,
I left my oven off."

02:12.233 --> 02:14.867
( laughs )
ooh, I should
hook up your blender.

02:14.869 --> 02:18.504
That way you can make
margaritas from the bedroom.

02:25.512 --> 02:28.313
All right,
with these sessions
here at my house,

02:28.315 --> 02:30.782
I guess it was inevitable
that my personal life

02:30.784 --> 02:33.185
Would intrude
occasionally.

02:33.187 --> 02:35.854
So I'm wide open
to discussing it.

02:35.856 --> 02:37.923
Can you have sex with her
from the bedroom

02:37.925 --> 02:40.526
When she's in the kitchen?

02:40.528 --> 02:42.895
Okay, everybody get out.

02:46.199 --> 02:48.233
Monica, I really appreciate
everything you're doing,

02:48.235 --> 02:50.169
But I don't think I need
all this stuff.

02:50.171 --> 02:51.870
Charlie, you are
going to love it.

02:51.872 --> 02:53.839
Here, press this button
on your phone.

02:53.841 --> 02:56.909
This one?
What happens now?

02:56.911 --> 02:58.544
This.

03:02.749 --> 03:04.950
That is a good button.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.752
( laughs )

03:06.754 --> 03:08.954
Hey, have you decided

03:08.956 --> 03:10.822
If you're gonna come with me
to comic-con this weekend?

03:10.824 --> 03:12.858
I really don't think so.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.860
I don't do well
with that crowd.

03:14.862 --> 03:18.630
Mostly 'cause they're all
wearing darth vader helmets.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.532
Come on, charlie.
It's gonna be fun.

03:20.534 --> 03:23.268
And I'm finally
going to get to wear
a sexy costume.

03:23.270 --> 03:24.937
My stupid, jealous
ex-boyfriend never let me.

03:24.939 --> 03:27.372
I don't know.
Nerds hate me.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.241
There's something about me
that brings out their rage.

03:29.243 --> 03:31.210
It's been like this
my whole life.

03:31.212 --> 03:33.946
In high school,
when I was a ballplayer,
at my wedding.

03:33.948 --> 03:36.415
Something always happens,
I lose it,

03:36.417 --> 03:39.585
And I wind up in a bathroom
with some brainiac wearing
a toilet for a hat.

03:39.587 --> 03:42.554
At my wedding!

03:42.556 --> 03:44.690
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

03:46.960 --> 03:49.661
Thanks for the ride, nolan,
but you don't have
to wait up here.

03:49.663 --> 03:50.862
You can wait in the car.

03:50.864 --> 03:55.667
If you make your first sale
and you're looking for somebody
to hug and kiss,

03:55.669 --> 03:57.436
I'm your guy.

03:57.438 --> 04:00.672
If it doesn't work out and you
want to slap somebody around,

04:00.674 --> 04:02.908
That's okay, too.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.377
Well, it's gonna go great.

04:05.379 --> 04:07.379
I stayed up all night
memorizing everything.

04:07.381 --> 04:09.815
So if you're just
gonna sit here, you might
as well quiz me.

04:09.817 --> 04:12.884
Okay.
What's the capital
of texas?

04:12.886 --> 04:15.821
- About proloft.
- Oh.

04:17.357 --> 04:19.891
Okay, what are proloft's
major side effects?

04:19.893 --> 04:22.361
Thank you for asking.

04:22.363 --> 04:25.864
Proloft may cause
cognitive impairment,

04:25.866 --> 04:28.400
Behavioral disinhibition,
lack of coordination,

04:28.402 --> 04:31.637
And hypotension.
Do not mix with alcohol.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.372
By the way, when they say,
"do not mix with alcohol,"

04:33.374 --> 04:34.940
It means this will be awesome
mixed with alcohol,

04:34.942 --> 04:36.475
But I'm not
gonna say that part.

04:37.910 --> 04:40.312
Are you
the galaxy-payson rep?

04:40.314 --> 04:42.848
Yes, thank you for asking.

04:42.850 --> 04:46.485
I'm sorry, but dr. Connor
has been called into surgery

04:46.487 --> 04:48.687
And he won't be available
till the end of the day.

04:48.689 --> 04:51.857
End of the day?
Can't I just pitch
to him during surgery?

04:51.859 --> 04:53.625
I won't touch anything.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.027
I'm sorry.

04:57.730 --> 04:59.998
In six hours, I don't even
know if this stuff is still
gonna be in my head.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.402
- I'm freaking out.
- You should try some proloft.

05:03.404 --> 05:06.772
Why, what does it do?

05:06.774 --> 05:08.840
It's an antianxiety
drug that--

05:08.842 --> 05:11.009
I know what it does.
I'm just freaking out.

05:12.578 --> 05:14.980
You're only supposed
to take one pill as needed.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.351
How you feeling?

05:19.353 --> 05:20.919
I'm still freaking out.

05:20.921 --> 05:23.021
Take some more.

05:26.959 --> 05:29.961
Hey, the system
you set up works.

05:29.963 --> 05:32.698
I just turned on my dryer
from my bed.

05:32.700 --> 05:35.467
<i>I'm so glad you changed</i>
<i>your mind about going</i>
<i>to comic-con.</i>

05:35.469 --> 05:37.969
<i>You ready to see</i>
<i>what I'm going to wear?</i>

05:37.971 --> 05:39.604
If it's yoda
in a bra and panties,

05:39.606 --> 05:41.873
I cannot be responsible
for my actions.

05:43.876 --> 05:47.012
( sputters )
wow!

05:47.014 --> 05:50.916
What are you,
like some kind of
a space stripper?

05:50.918 --> 05:54.353
Yeah, I'm saving up to go
to space nursing school.

05:55.488 --> 05:59.024
No, I'm gina x
from "stargazers."

05:59.026 --> 06:00.892
She's an intergalactic spy.

06:00.894 --> 06:02.461
Let me get this straight.

06:02.463 --> 06:05.130
You're an alien being
from a galaxy far, far away

06:05.132 --> 06:06.832
And your name is gina?

06:06.834 --> 06:08.734
<i>( phone chimes )</i>

06:10.069 --> 06:12.037
Oh, god.
Not again.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.638
What is it?

06:13.640 --> 06:15.107
My ex-boyfriend
keeps texting me.

06:15.109 --> 06:17.576
He heard I was going
to comic-con with another guy

06:17.578 --> 06:19.010
And he's totally losing it.

06:19.012 --> 06:21.546
You can't blame him.
He just lost gina x,

06:21.548 --> 06:23.448
The intergalactic
stripper nurse.

06:25.118 --> 06:26.685
Maybe we shouldn't go.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.887
Oh, come on.
You look great.

06:28.889 --> 06:32.090
I went cape shopping yesterday.
I bought a really great cape.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.559
But he's going
to be there

06:34.561 --> 06:36.461
And if we bump into him,
it's gonna get ugly.

06:36.463 --> 06:38.864
Oh, come on.
Going to this convention
means a lot to you.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.999
You can't just let
some bully push you around.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.801
What would gina x do?

06:42.803 --> 06:44.870
She would exhaust
him sexually

06:44.872 --> 06:47.539
And then bury
him alive.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.941
Okay, besides that.

06:50.910 --> 06:54.045
I think she'd do
what she wants to do.

06:54.047 --> 06:56.615
- All right, we'll go.
- <i>( phone chimes )</i>

06:56.617 --> 06:59.818
Unbelievable.
He just won't stop.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.586
Kent mosler, huh?

07:01.588 --> 07:03.688
You know, I am a therapist.
I could talk to this guy.

07:03.690 --> 07:05.457
Please don't.
He's unpredictable

07:05.459 --> 07:07.025
And you'll
just make it worse.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.827
Promise me
you won't do anything.

07:08.829 --> 07:11.096
- Fine, I promise.
- <i>( phone chimes )</i>

07:13.499 --> 07:15.734
I just got another
e-mail from my dryer.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.602
It's my neediest
appliance.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.137
( laughs )

07:19.139 --> 07:21.072
I'll be right back.

07:21.074 --> 07:23.909
Gina x's thong is giving
her a space wedgie.

07:30.516 --> 07:32.951
There you are,
kent mosler.

07:38.057 --> 07:40.125
Hello, this message
is for kent mosler.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.928
My name is charles goodson
and I think you and I should
get together and talk.

07:42.930 --> 07:45.197
Monica:
<i>Are you talking</i>
<i>to somebody?</i>

07:45.199 --> 07:48.233
It's crazy.
My microwave
just called me.

07:52.538 --> 07:54.039
Hey, brett.

07:54.041 --> 07:56.675
Hey, charlie.
You're in here pretty early.

07:56.677 --> 07:59.978
It's been a while since you
threw on a day drunk.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.180
I've never thrown on
a day drunk, brett.

08:02.182 --> 08:04.249
Well, then you're due.

08:04.251 --> 08:06.251
And you know what?
It's kind of nice.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.687
You're asleep by 7:00,
up with the birds,

08:08.689 --> 08:10.589
Four hours crawling around
in the shower,

08:10.591 --> 08:14.092
Then you're ready
just to start it back
up all over again.

08:14.094 --> 08:16.495
Yeah, as appealing
as all that sounds,

08:16.497 --> 08:18.163
I'm here to have a talk

08:18.165 --> 08:20.732
With a jealous ex-boyfriend
of a girl I'm seeing.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.734
Man, you want a weapon?

08:22.736 --> 08:25.637
I've got a bat, a knife,
another bat.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.839
I've got a bat
with knives in it.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.976
Jeez, brett, what do you
think is gonna happen?

08:30.978 --> 08:33.512
I don't know.
Race war?

08:35.281 --> 08:38.216
Is there something going on
that I don't know about?

08:38.218 --> 08:40.819
Charlie goodson?

08:40.821 --> 08:42.854
You must be kent.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.624
Thanks for coming by.
I'm hoping you and I can
have a friendly dialogue.

08:45.626 --> 08:49.094
Oh, did you? Yeah?
I don't think that's
gonna happen, jockstrap.

08:49.096 --> 08:52.898
Listen, kent, I know
that you're angry about
me and monica, but--

08:52.900 --> 08:55.000
Oh, no, I'm angry
about a lot of things--

08:55.002 --> 08:57.736
"star wars" prequels,
ending of "lost,"

08:57.738 --> 09:01.139
My mom getting
remarried to that guy

09:01.141 --> 09:03.775
Jack.

09:03.777 --> 09:06.211
But primarily I would
like my girlfriend back

09:06.213 --> 09:09.247
From the evil dr. Slick.

09:09.249 --> 09:11.550
Look, kent...

09:11.552 --> 09:13.618
Jeez, I'm a giant.

09:16.289 --> 09:19.224
I know it's hard
losing someone and it
happens to all of us,

09:19.226 --> 09:22.727
But the best way
to cope with rejection
is to move on.

09:22.729 --> 09:26.031
Ah, well said, dr. Slick.

09:26.033 --> 09:29.568
But you need to harken,
my friend.

09:29.570 --> 09:32.938
You have one day
to break up with monica

09:32.940 --> 09:35.006
Or else.

09:35.008 --> 09:36.341
Or else what?

09:36.343 --> 09:40.278
You have no idea
what I'm capable of.

09:40.280 --> 09:43.248
I will destroy you.

09:46.218 --> 09:49.087
Okay, now you know
that lightsabers
aren't real, right?

09:49.089 --> 09:51.590
They have a prototype.

09:53.059 --> 09:55.126
24 hours.

09:55.128 --> 09:57.596
Until they develop
the prototype?

09:57.598 --> 09:59.197
No! Our thing.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.966
Now, if you'll excuse me,

10:00.968 --> 10:03.368
I have to go have dinner
with my mom and...

10:03.370 --> 10:05.637
Jack.

10:10.810 --> 10:13.044
- ( knocking )
- come in.

10:13.980 --> 10:16.081
Hello.

10:16.083 --> 10:19.084
Oh, I am so sorry
to have kept you waiting.

10:19.086 --> 10:22.220
No, no, no,
that's totally
understandable.

10:24.323 --> 10:26.358
( giggles )

10:27.693 --> 10:29.694
Are you okay?

10:29.696 --> 10:33.331
Yes. I'm here to talk
to you about proloft.

10:33.333 --> 10:36.768
Mmm, proloft.

10:36.770 --> 10:39.204
If you've got anxiety,
not anymore you don't,

10:39.206 --> 10:42.040
'cause this stuff
really works.

10:45.411 --> 10:47.879
Are you sure you want
to do this now?

10:47.881 --> 10:49.314
Thank you for asking.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.716
Proloft causes
cognitive impairment,

10:51.718 --> 10:54.853
Behavioral disinhibition
and lack of coordination.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.955
Nailed it.

10:56.957 --> 11:00.959
Miss, you look
considerably impaired.

11:00.961 --> 11:03.261
No, I just dropped something.

11:03.263 --> 11:06.131
You want to buy some?

11:07.166 --> 11:09.367
Uh, I'm getting the nurse.

11:09.369 --> 11:12.137
Look at my boobs!

11:12.139 --> 11:14.673
Look at them!

11:24.717 --> 11:26.751
I look like a dick.

11:37.329 --> 11:39.197
I am hrothgar

11:39.199 --> 11:41.700
And I look like a dick.

11:43.369 --> 11:46.271
-  <i>( knocking )</i>
<i>- sam, would you</i>
<i>get the door?</i>

11:46.273 --> 11:49.240
I can't.
I'm getting ready
to go to caitlin's.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.242
Is that for comic-con?

11:51.244 --> 11:53.445
No, I'm gonna hit the gym.

11:54.414 --> 11:58.283
Wasn't sure if I wanted
to go away for college.

11:58.285 --> 11:59.451
Now I am.

12:01.353 --> 12:03.822
<i>( knocking )</i>

12:08.728 --> 12:10.395
Patrick.
What are you doing here?

12:10.397 --> 12:14.365
I got your e-mail.
Why would you say such
a horrible thing to me?

12:15.735 --> 12:19.337
Oh, I'm sorry.
You've obviously
gone insane.

12:19.339 --> 12:22.440
It's for comic-con.
What e-mail are you
talking about?

12:22.442 --> 12:24.809
The one you sent telling me
that I was beyond help

12:24.811 --> 12:26.311
And needed a psychic.

12:26.313 --> 12:29.414
Patrick, I would
never say something
like that to you.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.783
My god, somebody must
have hacked my e-mail.

12:31.785 --> 12:33.418
That's exactly
what the e-mail said
you would say.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.755
- I didn't say that either.
- It said you would
say that, too.

12:36.757 --> 12:38.957
<i>( machines humming )</i>

12:38.959 --> 12:41.760
What the hell is that?

12:45.865 --> 12:47.265
You're seeing
this, right?

12:47.267 --> 12:48.900
Patrick:
<i>Yeah.</i>

12:51.470 --> 12:53.204
( turns off )

12:53.206 --> 12:55.006
Oh, my god.

12:55.008 --> 12:57.408
All the appliances turned
on by themselves.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.444
It's like "beauty
and the beast" in here.

13:02.214 --> 13:03.948
Oh, man.

13:11.023 --> 13:13.792
What's going on
with your house, charlie?

13:13.794 --> 13:15.827
Monica hooked everything
up to the internet

13:15.829 --> 13:17.529
So I could control it
wirelessly.

13:17.531 --> 13:19.097
How's that working out?

13:19.099 --> 13:21.366
So far, I don't like it.

13:24.937 --> 13:26.471
Whoa.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.873
Wow, look at you.

13:28.875 --> 13:32.043
Just call me hrothgar.

13:32.045 --> 13:34.179
What's going on?

13:34.181 --> 13:36.581
You tell me.
You're the one who
hooked all this up.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.116
Tell me you didn't
talk to kent.

13:38.118 --> 13:40.185
( stammers )
kent?

13:40.187 --> 13:43.288
Of course not.
What makes you say that?

13:43.290 --> 13:45.957
-  <i>( music playing )</i>
<i>- kent:</i> <i>Charles goodson.</i>

13:47.426 --> 13:50.328
<i>I told you I would</i>
<i>destroy you, and I will.</i>

13:50.330 --> 13:53.965
You know, we might
have bumped into
each other somewhere.

13:59.338 --> 14:00.505
Where are you?

14:00.507 --> 14:03.575
I have taken over
your tv.

14:03.577 --> 14:06.077
You haven't really
taken it over.

14:06.079 --> 14:07.378
You're in
the right-hand corner.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.414
Really?

14:09.416 --> 14:11.015
Give me a moment.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.383
<i>( typing )</i>

14:12.385 --> 14:14.919
<i>Now I have</i>
<i>taken over your tv.</i>

14:14.921 --> 14:17.956
Prepare to suffer
the full wrath of--

14:17.958 --> 14:20.592
No, no, you're still
just in the corner.

14:21.994 --> 14:24.529
I'm on your tv.
I feel like that's
good enough.

14:24.531 --> 14:25.597
What do you want, kent?

14:25.599 --> 14:28.132
I want you back.

14:28.134 --> 14:32.203
And I'm going to disrupt
this neanderthal's house
until I get you.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.105
- Is there
anything you can do?
- I don't think so.

14:34.107 --> 14:36.608
He's a computer genius.
He was a hacker
for the cia.

14:36.610 --> 14:39.611
- Well, you
didn't mention that.
- I said be careful.

14:39.613 --> 14:41.913
No, no, you have to put it
all in one sentence.

14:41.915 --> 14:45.216
Like, "be careful,
he's a hacker for the cia."

14:45.218 --> 14:48.653
Behold,
I am your whole screen.

14:48.655 --> 14:53.358
There's nothing you can do.
I will torment you forever.

14:53.360 --> 14:56.594
- <i>I got all the time</i>
<i>in the world.</i>
<i>- Shut up, punk.</i>

14:56.596 --> 14:59.998
I've got a circuit breaker
and I know how to use it.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.399
I win.

15:01.401 --> 15:02.934
Oh!

15:02.936 --> 15:05.303
I've also got stairs.

15:05.305 --> 15:06.571
And a head lump.

15:13.312 --> 15:15.446
Hey.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.181
What's going on?

15:17.183 --> 15:18.316
I had to turn off
my power.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.451
Want some
rancid pork chops?

15:20.453 --> 15:22.353
Depends.

15:22.355 --> 15:24.355
How rancid?

15:24.357 --> 15:28.693
Could probably wash 'em down
with some of this milk.

15:31.297 --> 15:32.964
Why did you turn off
your power?

15:32.966 --> 15:34.532
It's a long story.
I met this girl

15:34.534 --> 15:36.567
And we're going to comic-con
this weekend, so--

15:36.569 --> 15:39.337
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're going to comic-con?

15:39.339 --> 15:42.073
It's like
the million man March
but with nerds.

15:43.409 --> 15:46.577
Anyway, this girl's
ex-boyfriend hacked
my entire house,

15:46.579 --> 15:50.214
Took over my television,
and changed my outgoing
message.

15:50.216 --> 15:52.583
- To what?
- Now it says, "hi,
thanks for calling.

15:52.585 --> 15:55.386
Wait for the beep,
then shove the phone
up your ass."

15:55.388 --> 15:58.122
Well, if you're going
to comic-con,

15:58.124 --> 15:59.390
We might as well
drive down together.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.459
Hold on.
You go to this thing?

16:01.461 --> 16:03.494
No, I don't go.

16:03.496 --> 16:06.297
The mutant king
of planet nuru does.

16:06.299 --> 16:10.101
And believe me,
it's a weekend with
major tail.

16:10.103 --> 16:13.037
I'm guessing major tail
is your sidekick.

16:13.039 --> 16:15.139
I'm afraid so.

16:16.408 --> 16:19.177
Charlie, chill.
You can't let this guy
get to you.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.179
I know,
but I just want to--

16:21.181 --> 16:23.514
I want to pull
his spiderman underoos
over his head

16:23.516 --> 16:25.383
And stuff him through
a basketball hoop.

16:25.385 --> 16:28.319
Just forget about it.
Let's just go see a movie.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.188
How do you get
to your browser?

16:30.190 --> 16:31.756
There's usually a thing
on the desktop.

16:31.758 --> 16:34.025
There's nothing
on your desktop.

16:34.027 --> 16:35.727
You've got
to be kidding me.

16:35.729 --> 16:37.295
Everything's gone.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.998
My patient records,
my billing, my novel.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.366
- Oh, you wrote a novel?
- Just a title.

16:41.368 --> 16:43.201
I'm still noodling.

16:45.437 --> 16:48.239
It was him.
That dirty bastard.

16:48.241 --> 16:49.640
Charlie,
think healthy thoughts.

16:49.642 --> 16:53.411
Screw healthy.
Let's go slam-dunk a nerd.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.157
Hello, kent.

17:06.159 --> 17:07.592
Hey, get your hands
off me.

17:07.594 --> 17:10.294
This man's
a false hrothgar.

17:10.296 --> 17:11.629
Help, guys.
Back me up.

17:11.631 --> 17:14.399
You're not getting away.
You screwed up my life

17:14.401 --> 17:17.368
And I can't remember
the title of my novel.

17:17.370 --> 17:19.337
- Dipwad.
- Whoa, whoa.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.205
Be very cool.

17:21.207 --> 17:24.342
Back off, nerds.

17:25.344 --> 17:27.445
Didn't you hear
what I said?

17:27.447 --> 17:29.514
Back off.

17:29.516 --> 17:31.115
( laughs )
big deal.

17:31.117 --> 17:32.517
A rubber sword.

17:32.519 --> 17:35.319
- ( chuckles )
- ( clangs )

17:36.488 --> 17:39.457
Run away.
Run away.

17:48.600 --> 17:51.736
You're dead, blue...

17:51.738 --> 17:54.405
Turd.

17:54.407 --> 17:57.375
Unless you give me back
everything on my computer.

17:57.377 --> 17:59.544
Then you'll be
a little less dead.

17:59.546 --> 18:02.213
Just hit me already.
Okay, I know you want to.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.382
You people solve all your
problems with violence.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.250
Because you people
drive us to it.

18:06.252 --> 18:11.689
Living in the shadows,
hiding behind a wall
of awesome technology?

18:11.691 --> 18:13.524
I don't get to be
the cool athlete

18:13.526 --> 18:16.861
Okay, I'm the nerd
that stands in the rain

18:16.863 --> 18:20.298
Holding a boom box
and realizes the girl's on
a date with another guy.

18:20.300 --> 18:23.367
I can't go toe-to-toe
with a jock like you.

18:23.369 --> 18:25.736
I'd do anything
to be like you.

18:28.140 --> 18:29.407
Fine, I get it.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.609
Nobody's got it easy.
Life's tough.

18:31.611 --> 18:35.279
So just give me back
all my stuff and we'll
call it even.

18:36.515 --> 18:38.549
Nah.

18:41.386 --> 18:43.488
You almost had me, nerd.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.790
- ( whimpers )
- charlie! Charlie!

18:45.792 --> 18:49.360
Don't do it
until I block the door.

18:49.362 --> 18:51.762
( toilet flushes )

18:54.766 --> 18:56.534
So, lacey,
how you feeling?

18:56.536 --> 18:58.436
Nolan tells us
you had an interesting
sales call yesterday.

18:58.438 --> 19:00.571
Yeah, slurring
all your words,

19:00.573 --> 19:01.873
Stumbling all over
the place,

19:01.875 --> 19:04.842
And knocking over
a tray of urine samples.

19:04.844 --> 19:08.379
That last one was me.

19:08.381 --> 19:10.715
For your information,
it went great.

19:10.717 --> 19:13.851
When the doctor found out
how many proloft I took
without dying,

19:13.853 --> 19:17.355
He was so impressed by
the safety of the product,
he asked for a case.

19:17.357 --> 19:20.291
Or he waited
for you to pass out,

19:20.293 --> 19:23.828
Copped a feel,
and felt all guilty about it.

19:25.564 --> 19:27.798
Whatevs.
The guy's a doctor.

19:27.800 --> 19:31.202
Okay, speaking of crazy...
Charlie, I hope you
don't mind,

19:31.204 --> 19:34.872
But I told everyone how
the it girl's ex-boyfriend
was messing with your house.

19:34.874 --> 19:36.707
Oh, right, right.
I took care of all that.

19:36.709 --> 19:40.378
By the way, if anyone got
any unusual e-mail from me,

19:40.380 --> 19:42.580
It was from him.
He hacked my account.

19:42.582 --> 19:47.251
I didn't really think
you wanted to raise your rates
by $20 a session.

19:47.253 --> 19:50.721
Actually, that e-mail
was from me.

19:50.723 --> 19:52.723
No problem.
I just deleted it.

19:52.725 --> 19:54.892
Straight to trash.

19:54.894 --> 19:57.728
I got the same message
from your hacker.

19:57.730 --> 20:00.831
But don't worry,
I'm blocking everything
that comes from you.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.834
But then how will you
get my bills?

20:03.836 --> 20:05.903
Oh, not a problem at all.

20:05.905 --> 20:07.972
( laughs )
you're welcome.

20:11.243 --> 20:13.778
So, give us the deets.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.680
How did you finally
get rid of the ex?

20:15.682 --> 20:18.249
Well, I went down
to san diego and we had
a frank and honest talk.

20:18.251 --> 20:20.418
So you're still with
the hot computer girl?

20:20.420 --> 20:22.320
- No, she dumped me.
- Why?

20:22.322 --> 20:25.456
Because I beat up
her ex-boyfriend after
the frank and honest talk.

20:27.292 --> 20:29.794
She felt sorry
for him and now
they're back together.

20:29.796 --> 20:32.964
So, wait,
the super hot chick
got back with the nerd

20:32.966 --> 20:35.833
Because he got hurt
fighting for her?

20:35.835 --> 20:37.435
Not gonna happen.

20:37.437 --> 20:40.238
What the hell, lady?

20:40.240 --> 20:41.839
But I think we can all learn
something from this.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.774
I didn't control my anger

20:43.776 --> 20:45.810
And I lost something
very dear to me.

20:45.812 --> 20:47.445
I thought you weren't
that into her.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.981
No, no, but we had
a lot of fun together.

20:49.983 --> 20:51.949
You said she was
too geeky for you.

20:51.951 --> 20:54.952
Well, a little,
but she was very attractive.

20:54.954 --> 20:59.657
So you're saying you got mad
and lost a piece of ass?

21:00.926 --> 21:02.960
Essentially.
