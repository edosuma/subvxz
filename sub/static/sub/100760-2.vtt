Oh, yeah.

Five stars, huh?

00:47.089 --> 00:49.300
Wait, you're leaving?

00:49.341 --> 00:51.385
I thought you said
we would talk after.

00:51.427 --> 00:52.887
Oh. We're talking.

00:52.928 --> 00:55.973
We're agreeing to give
each other five stars.

00:56.015 --> 00:57.141
That's talking, right?

00:57.183 --> 00:59.810
Wow, uh...

00:59.852 --> 01:02.730
Okay.

01:02.772 --> 01:05.816
So...?

01:14.867 --> 01:18.913
You would've given me six stars

Let's start with why you were

03:55.235 --> 03:57.071
going to throw yourself
in the torrent.

03:57.112 --> 04:00.240
Right, the torrent.

04:00.282 --> 04:02.534
I guess I...

04:02.576 --> 04:04.036
Also, this session's
being recorded

04:04.078 --> 04:06.664
for quality purposes. Go on.

04:08.707 --> 04:10.709
I had a great life.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.629
I was young, healthy,
great body,

04:13.671 --> 04:15.172
great face,

04:15.214 --> 04:17.257
great hair, great skin,

04:17.299 --> 04:18.842
great teeth,

04:18.884 --> 04:20.386
great eyes, great abs, great...

04:20.427 --> 04:22.137
Sounds like you had
every kind of privilege

04:22.179 --> 04:23.722
and you never questioned it.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.599
Then, bam,
self-driving car crash?

04:25.641 --> 04:27.017
That's not fair.

04:27.059 --> 04:28.727
Now I live in this
weird fantasy world

04:28.769 --> 04:30.145
with my girlfriend's grandma.

04:30.187 --> 04:31.605
Life's not fair.

04:31.647 --> 04:34.274
Neither is digital
life extension.

04:34.316 --> 04:35.734
What's fair
and what should happen,

04:35.776 --> 04:37.695
that's just in your head.

04:37.736 --> 04:40.155
- Super.
- You have to make
your own meaning.

04:40.197 --> 04:43.158
What makes life worth living
for you? Uh, uh...

04:43.200 --> 04:45.953
Y-You're petting me
extremely hard right now.

04:45.995 --> 04:48.080
Sorry, you're stressing me out.

04:48.122 --> 04:50.374
What's the meaning of life
in ten seconds? Come on.

04:50.416 --> 04:52.167
Think of it as
your bare minimum.

04:52.209 --> 04:55.379
What do you need so you won't
dive into that thing?

04:56.880 --> 04:59.550
I guess I just
still want to be a man.

04:59.591 --> 05:00.884
Well, what does that mean?

05:00.926 --> 05:03.804
Good question.

05:03.846 --> 05:07.307
I want to be independent

05:07.349 --> 05:09.268
and capable.

05:09.309 --> 05:12.438
When you're young, people
have to do everything for you,

05:12.479 --> 05:15.107
and then you grow up
and you become a man

05:15.149 --> 05:17.359
and-and people rely on you.

05:17.401 --> 05:20.654
Kids look up to you.
Women want to be with you.

05:20.696 --> 05:22.322
You know?

05:22.364 --> 05:24.450
I had that, or...

05:24.491 --> 05:28.120
I was on my way to that.

05:28.162 --> 05:29.913
Mm-hmm.

05:29.955 --> 05:31.832
I'm going to give you
an assignment.

05:31.874 --> 05:35.044
Talk to at least five
of your fellow uploads,

05:35.085 --> 05:37.004
take notes, then find me,

05:37.046 --> 05:39.923
and maybe you made a friend
who makes it all feel worth it.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.811
Well, I'll just
wipe this off first.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.605
Myra,

05:54.646 --> 05:56.732
I have a drone
follow you everywhere,

05:56.774 --> 06:00.736
and every single day,
you give her sweets in the park.

06:00.778 --> 06:04.406
Now, today, get her to eat
the Rachel Ray Junior

06:04.448 --> 06:07.493
steamed squash I printed
this morning and nothing else,

06:07.534 --> 06:10.079
or I will fire you.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.250
Should I come back later?

06:15.292 --> 06:17.419
No, it's fine. Come in.

06:17.461 --> 06:19.088
I met with my bank,

06:19.129 --> 06:22.049
and they approved the loan
for my dad's upload. Yay!

06:22.091 --> 06:24.635
Uh, as long as my employer...
That-that's you...

06:24.676 --> 06:26.678
Um, confirms in writing
that I qualify

06:26.720 --> 06:28.180
for the employee discount.

06:29.264 --> 06:30.682
What was wrong with him again?

06:30.724 --> 06:32.309
Dad has vape lung.

06:32.351 --> 06:34.144
He thought it was safer
than smoking,

06:34.186 --> 06:35.813
then all the studies came out.

06:35.854 --> 06:38.107
I thought he didn't believe
in upload.

06:38.148 --> 06:40.067
Well, he's still being
a bit of a Ludd about it,

06:40.109 --> 06:42.212
but, um, you know, when he sees
I've spent the money, I...

06:42.236 --> 06:44.196
You know, I don't feel
comfortable signing this.

06:44.238 --> 06:48.450
You need a 4.6 employee rating
to qualify for that discount.

06:48.492 --> 06:51.328
Right now,
you're at 4.598, so...

06:51.370 --> 06:53.997
Come on, I'm-I'm-I'm so close.

06:55.666 --> 06:56.917
Here's what I'll do.

06:56.959 --> 06:58.752
You could hit a 4.6 today,

06:58.794 --> 07:00.230
but then you could
slip under tomorrow.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.756
You hit a 4.8,

07:02.798 --> 07:05.342
and I'll sign this letter
as written, no prob.

07:05.384 --> 07:08.428
But I-I just need you

You can still, uh...

Look up your own damn porn!

12:35.505 --> 12:37.340
Oh, please. Yeah, right.

12:37.382 --> 12:39.759
Is there anything left
to talk about?

12:39.801 --> 12:42.137

Oh, me? Uh, I have
homework from a dog,

14:26.408 --> 14:27.659
That's weird.

Well, I've got
25,000 square feet

a little weird.

14:38.503 --> 14:40.505
Uh, game designer.
Yeah, freeware.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.132
And a little modeling
in college.

14:42.173 --> 14:44.342
I mean, it's no big deal.
Mostly catalog work.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.510
A couple commercials.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.178
Not much money in freeware.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.722
No.

14:48.763 --> 14:50.682
And what did you do?

14:50.724 --> 14:53.059
Oh, not much.

14:53.101 --> 14:54.686
Just co-ran the second-largest

14:54.728 --> 14:56.229
privately owned company
in the world

14:56.271 --> 15:00.025

Sorry.

15:16.166 --> 15:17.751
I'm blanking on the name.

15:17.792 --> 15:20.295
You're blanking on the name
of your own app?

15:22.297 --> 15:24.758
Yeah, I-I've been having
some memory gaps.

15:24.799 --> 15:27.135
I guess I'm just
a little death-lagged.

15:27.177 --> 15:29.262
Um, we wrote a program
that allows anyone

15:29.304 --> 15:30.972
to save their own uploads.

15:31.014 --> 15:32.766
So you can create
your own digital afterlife

or family for free.

No. I-I was in a car accident.

15:43.234 --> 15:45.111
Yeah, sure.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.072
Yeah, you just, uh, threatened

15:47.113 --> 15:48.823
a 600-billion-dollar-a-year
industry,

15:48.865 --> 15:51.242
and no one murdered you.

15:54.704 --> 15:56.665
Nobody murders anybody.

Okay. Well, he sucks.

16:28.238 --> 16:31.241
No damage to report.

- You are clearly very damaged.
- No.

wet, just use it in the tub.

17:34.512 --> 17:36.306

No. I mean, maybe there wasn't
enough storage space,

Ta-da.

23:39.627 --> 23:43.714
Okay, seriously,
what can I do for you?

23:43.756 --> 23:45.716
Just ask me anything.

23:45.758 --> 23:48.636
You know what you can do for me?
You can tell me what's wrong.

23:48.678 --> 23:49.971
'Cause you've been all like...

23:51.055 --> 23:52.306
all day.

23:55.601 --> 23:57.186
You got an hour?

23:57.228 --> 24:00.231
I have infinity.

24:00.273 --> 24:01.333
Well, you know what?
In one sense,

24:01.357 --> 24:02.692
it's just as bad as Nitely.

24:02.733 --> 24:04.086
You know, you have to keep
pleasing people,

24:04.110 --> 24:05.653
and you can't let
your numbers down.

24:05.695 --> 24:08.364
- Emotional work is real work.
- Yeah. Exactly.

24:08.406 --> 24:09.824
And I can't walk away
from the job.

24:09.866 --> 24:12.410
- Why not?
- My dad. My-my dad's dying.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.971
- Oh, God. I'm sorry.
- Yeah, it sucks.

24:13.995 --> 24:17.331
And-and my mom died unexpectedly
a few years ago.

24:17.373 --> 24:20.418
- Exactly! And-and Dad doesn't
think heaven could be heaven

24:20.459 --> 24:23.337
without Mom in it, which means
he's... he's basically okay

24:23.379 --> 24:25.214
with not being with me,

24:25.256 --> 24:29.135
which I might find romantic
if it wasn't so insulting.

24:29.177 --> 24:31.071
But really, I just feel like
he's clinically depressed

24:31.095 --> 24:32.680
and not thinking straight.

24:32.722 --> 24:34.807
I mean, so he isn't saving
anything for upload.

24:34.849 --> 24:36.225
That's just all on me.

24:36.267 --> 24:38.936
I mean, he might not even use it
if I pay for it.

24:45.776 --> 24:51.616
I guess my biggest fear
is he'll die, too,

24:51.657 --> 24:55.703
and my last connection
to childhood

24:55.745 --> 24:58.915
is just gone.

25:01.334 --> 25:04.045
And I won't ever find
anyone who...

25:04.086 --> 25:07.465
understands me like that or...

25:07.506 --> 25:09.634
loves me unconditionally.

25:11.344 --> 25:13.346
Yeah.

25:18.059 --> 25:22.271
Well, thanks.

25:22.313 --> 25:24.690
I feel a lot better.
