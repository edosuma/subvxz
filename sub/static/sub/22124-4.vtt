17:45.977 --> 17:49.677
Look, please,
you have to believe me.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.200
Filthy liar.I believe him.

17:51.244 --> 17:52.941
My gut tells me
it'’s not him.

17:52.984 --> 17:54.595
And I want to
explore this mystery

17:54.638 --> 17:56.118
resident that Emily
wanted to expel.

17:56.162 --> 17:57.859
How much walking
and talking

17:57.902 --> 17:59.948
like a murderous,
sociopathic duck is necessary

17:59.991 --> 18:03.125
for us to realize the killer
is sitting in our laps?[phone beeps]

18:03.169 --> 18:04.953
[chuckling]

18:04.996 --> 18:07.564
Something you'’d like
to add here, Espinoza?

18:07.608 --> 18:10.393
Uh, no. Sorry.
I just...

18:10.437 --> 18:12.439
I need to go help a
friend who'’s in trouble.

18:12.482 --> 18:14.571
Well, don'’t let your day job
keep you.

18:14.615 --> 18:17.183
[exhales] I'’ll have
the victim'’s files sent over.

18:17.226 --> 18:20.403
Maybe we can get a lead
on whoever she wanted to expel.

18:22.971 --> 18:24.668
I doubt I could
be less impressed

18:24.712 --> 18:26.235
by the lack of
consensus here.

18:26.279 --> 18:30.065
All we have now is no murder
weapon and a possible motive?

18:30.109 --> 18:31.980
We got to cut
him loose.
[scoffs]

18:32.023 --> 18:33.155
Without a murder weapon,

18:33.199 --> 18:34.983
we don'’t have enough evidence
to keep him.

18:35.026 --> 18:38.291
Hello, Tyson.
Just me again.

18:38.334 --> 18:42.077
Now, why can'’t you
embrace your true self, hmm?

18:42.121 --> 18:43.600
You'’re a bad seed.

18:43.644 --> 18:45.167
Just celebrate the
darkness inside.

18:45.211 --> 18:47.387
No, please!
Just leave me alone!

18:47.430 --> 18:49.302
I won'’t leave you alone until
you tell me the truth.Look, please don'’t hurt me.

18:49.345 --> 18:51.304
I promise I'’ve changed.

18:51.347 --> 18:53.306
Lucifer, let him go!

18:53.349 --> 18:57.136
I take full responsibility
for his actions.

18:57.179 --> 18:59.877
This won'’t happen again.Why not?

18:59.921 --> 19:01.749
Kid turns out not
to be the murderer,

19:01.792 --> 19:03.142
your friend just
scared him straight.

19:04.360 --> 19:05.709
Well done, Lucifer.

19:05.753 --> 19:07.798
Way to be a good influence.

19:07.842 --> 19:09.670
How dare you say that?

19:09.713 --> 19:12.412
Do you see what
you'’ve done now?

19:12.455 --> 19:14.457
[scoffs]

19:14.501 --> 19:16.329
[sighs]

19:17.808 --> 19:20.420

19:42.746 --> 19:46.837
your substitute counselor
and resident bad influence.

19:46.881 --> 19:48.491
Is this some kind
of reverse psychology?

19:48.535 --> 19:50.319
[laughs]
I assure you,

19:50.363 --> 19:52.452
my budding miscreant,
nothing of the sort.

19:52.495 --> 19:54.932
No, the lesson
I'’m about to teach you

19:54.976 --> 19:57.457
is pure deviance.
Yes, come on.

19:57.500 --> 20:01.461
Room for everyone. Come on,
you at the back. Right.

20:01.504 --> 20:06.205
Okay, before I start,
I'’d humbly like to ask you guys

20:06.248 --> 20:09.469
a little about
yourselves, so, tell me,

20:09.512 --> 20:11.471
what is it you all desire?

20:11.514 --> 20:13.081
Get rich.Instagram model.

Oh.

20:20.567 --> 20:23.091
I hear you. I hear you. Right.

20:23.134 --> 20:24.527
So what I'’m getting

20:24.571 --> 20:27.356
is that you all want to get back
to your true selves.

20:28.575 --> 20:29.837
[laughs]

20:29.880 --> 20:31.839
I mean, yes, micro-nutrients

20:31.882 --> 20:34.058
in the soil areimportant,

20:34.102 --> 20:35.277
but the key here, people,

20:35.321 --> 20:38.106
the key here is
vertical integration.

20:38.149 --> 20:41.414
And it all starts
with solid distribution.

20:41.457 --> 20:44.112
Right. Now, I'’m partial
to the Paraguay corridor,

20:44.155 --> 20:46.201

20:46.941 --> 20:48.986

20:49.030 --> 20:51.380
Uh, but what about
hands-on experience?

20:51.424 --> 20:53.121
[laughs]
Oh, right.

20:53.164 --> 20:55.645
Well, I do happen
to know some wonderful CEOs

20:55.689 --> 20:57.343
down in Sinaloa, Mexico.

20:57.386 --> 20:59.736
Perhaps I could arrange
some internships.

20:59.780 --> 21:01.434
Yeah, yeah.Oh, well.

21:01.477 --> 21:04.785
The way to hell really is paved
with bad acne-prone intentions.

21:04.828 --> 21:06.874
So much potential here! But...

21:06.917 --> 21:09.268
Sorry. Am I boring you, darling?

21:09.311 --> 21:12.271
Yeah. Screw Paraguay
and micro-nutrients.

21:12.314 --> 21:15.230
The only things you need
to be your own CEO

21:15.274 --> 21:17.798
is irrigation and
a south-facing slope.

21:17.841 --> 21:20.627
Ah.

21:23.325 --> 21:25.458
Here'’s your drug empire, Teach.

21:31.638 --> 21:33.422
Well, then.

21:33.466 --> 21:38.253

22:29.130 --> 22:30.392
Detective.

22:30.436 --> 22:33.134
What is going on here?

22:33.177 --> 22:35.005
And how did you
get that horse?

22:35.049 --> 22:36.746
What horse?

22:36.790 --> 22:38.095
Ugh.

22:38.139 --> 22:40.228
Bye!

22:40.271 --> 22:42.535
Ah, they should award him
his wings.

22:42.578 --> 22:44.406
Then he'’d look like
Pegasus. [laughs]

22:44.450 --> 22:46.887
What are you
so upset about?

22:46.930 --> 22:48.889
I mean, it was
a valuable teaching moment

22:48.932 --> 22:50.020
for the children.

22:50.064 --> 22:52.414
They are our future, after all.

22:52.458 --> 22:54.416
You'’re teaching them
to grow drugs.

22:54.460 --> 22:56.853
No, no, no, I'’m teaching them
to selldrugs.

22:56.897 --> 22:58.725
Regardless,
what brings you here?

22:58.768 --> 23:00.640
Our job.

23:00.683 --> 23:04.426
Which is to find the kid
that Emily was about to expel.

23:04.470 --> 23:05.993
In her files, it said

23:06.036 --> 23:07.690
that she had recently busted
one of the residents

23:07.734 --> 23:10.389
for apparently running
a drug operation.

23:10.432 --> 23:12.042
No.

23:12.086 --> 23:13.348
Oh.

23:13.392 --> 23:14.697
Right. [laughs]
So... Well, it appears

23:14.741 --> 23:16.307
I'’ve been doing our job, too.

23:16.351 --> 23:18.658
Carly, front and center.

23:18.701 --> 23:20.399
My prized pupil.

23:20.442 --> 23:22.401
She had her own weed operation
already up and running.

23:22.444 --> 23:25.447
Oh. So, this is all yours?

23:25.491 --> 23:28.145
Not saying a word
without my lawyer.

23:28.189 --> 23:30.365
[laughs]
Sorry, I taught her that.

23:30.409 --> 23:31.714
But I have to say, Detective,

23:31.758 --> 23:34.369
this young lady
really is going places.

23:34.413 --> 23:37.372
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
All the way to jail.

23:40.593 --> 23:42.986
Yo, buddy.

23:43.030 --> 23:44.379
What the hell happened, man?

23:44.423 --> 23:46.381
Detective Espinoza.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.035
It'’s good to see you.

23:48.078 --> 23:49.819
[laughs]
When I heard the charges,
I mean...

23:49.863 --> 23:52.518
Listen, we had just performed
the act of love,

23:52.561 --> 23:54.737
and then she demanded money.

23:54.781 --> 23:57.697
[chuckles]At first, I assumed
it was for bus fare,

23:57.740 --> 23:59.612
but then she wanted
quite a large amount.

23:59.655 --> 24:01.701
And then her cousin showed up,

24:01.744 --> 24:04.268
who shared very little familial
resemblance, by the way,

24:04.312 --> 24:05.835
and then he also
demanded money.

24:05.879 --> 24:07.576
Right, right.
So when he wouldn'’t take no

24:07.620 --> 24:10.579
for an answer, you got into
a fight, and you beat him up.

24:10.623 --> 24:12.320
Uh-huh.

24:12.363 --> 24:13.930
You do realize
she'’s a call girl, right?

24:13.974 --> 24:16.846
I know what a prostitute is!

24:18.544 --> 24:20.937
I just didn'’t know she was one.

24:20.981 --> 24:24.288
And then, her cousin-- well,
he wouldn'’t listen to reason.

24:24.332 --> 24:27.727
You mean... her pimp?

24:27.770 --> 24:30.120
Yes, of course.

24:30.164 --> 24:32.601
Look, I don'’t need any of
the details, all right?

24:32.645 --> 24:34.473
The important thing is,
the watch commander'’s

24:34.516 --> 24:36.953
my old training officer,
so I pulled some strings.

24:36.997 --> 24:40.000
You'’re cut loose.
Don'’t worry.

24:40.043 --> 24:42.916
[laughing]: Don'’t worry.
I didn'’t say a word to Lucifer.

24:44.526 --> 24:46.180
PIERCE: How we doing
on the investigation?

24:46.223 --> 24:48.051
CHLOE:
Well, this investigation has...

24:48.095 --> 24:49.792
[clears throat]
...smoked out

24:49.836 --> 24:52.055
Carly Glantz.
Rap sheet a mile long.

24:52.099 --> 24:54.231
Made no progress at reform.

24:54.275 --> 24:56.495
Working theory is
that she found out

24:56.538 --> 24:58.105
Emily was about
to expel her.

24:58.148 --> 25:00.237
So she killed her to protect
herself and her drug operation.

25:00.281 --> 25:02.501
And then, Carly lawyered up
before we could get to her.

25:02.544 --> 25:05.329
Still no murder weapon?And no evidence
tying her to the scene.

25:05.373 --> 25:06.461
Lucifer, any thoughts?

25:06.505 --> 25:08.419
CHLOE:
Lucifer is not

25:08.463 --> 25:09.595
in the state of mind

25:09.638 --> 25:11.510
to offer any constructive advice
right now.

25:11.553 --> 25:12.815
Reach for the unexpected

25:12.859 --> 25:15.383
and allow yourself
to be surprised.

25:15.426 --> 25:16.993
Like crisps
and chocolate.

25:17.037 --> 25:21.128
The results
can be quite pleasing. Mm.

25:21.171 --> 25:23.913
That'’s good advice.
Decker, throw out the manual.

25:23.957 --> 25:24.827
Think outside the box.

25:24.871 --> 25:26.002
Yes, Lieutenant.
CHLOE:
What?

25:26.046 --> 25:27.656
I'’m sorry. What are you
asking me to do?

25:27.700 --> 25:29.440
Because Carly isn'’t gonna talk.

25:29.484 --> 25:31.442
I want to talk.

25:34.620 --> 25:39.015
Ah. Allow yourself to
be surprised indeed.

25:39.059 --> 25:41.496
CHLOE:
So, you want
to make a statement?

25:41.540 --> 25:44.586
Yeah. So...

25:44.630 --> 25:47.676
I guess I'’ve been enlightened
by the Firehawk Path.

25:47.720 --> 25:49.722
And I know
I can'’t find my happiness

25:49.765 --> 25:51.506
if I don'’t
present my truth.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.029
The night of the murder,
I saw Tyson Chase

25:53.073 --> 25:56.206
digging by the sundial,
burying something.

25:56.250 --> 25:57.947
Burying what?
Don'’t know.

25:57.991 --> 26:00.602
It was dark, and I was
looking through a window.

26:00.646 --> 26:03.387
Geez, do I have
to do all your work for you?

26:03.431 --> 26:05.389
Carly, tone.

26:05.433 --> 26:07.522
Should I roll over
and fetch, too, Dad?

26:07.566 --> 26:09.611
Parents. Am I right?

26:09.655 --> 26:12.222
CHLOE: So, how do I know
youdidn'’t kill Emily?

26:12.266 --> 26:13.484
CARLY'’S DAD:
Because Carly has

26:13.528 --> 26:15.574
an iron-clad alibi.

26:15.617 --> 26:17.924
During the murder,
she was in the shared room...

26:17.967 --> 26:20.448
on the computer,

26:20.491 --> 26:22.581
video chatting
with her boyfriend.

26:23.930 --> 26:28.717
Now, instead of harassing
my daughter any further,

26:28.761 --> 26:31.677
I suggest you go see
what'’s under that sundial.

26:34.897 --> 26:37.204
LUCIFER:
I don'’t mean to backseat

26:37.247 --> 26:39.423
dig, but aren'’t you
a bit far from the sundial?

26:39.467 --> 26:42.513
I'’ve got it. Thanks.

26:42.557 --> 26:44.341
At least, I hope I do.

26:44.385 --> 26:49.608
Hey, Ella, you'’re kind of, sort
of friendly with the lieutenant.

26:49.651 --> 26:51.131
What'’s his deal?

26:51.174 --> 26:52.741
Regarding what?

26:52.785 --> 26:56.440
Well, no matter what I do,
it seems Pierce wants

26:56.484 --> 26:58.051
to be a complete jerk to me.

26:58.094 --> 27:02.272
Oh, this isn'’t about
that crazy vibe between you two?

27:02.316 --> 27:04.927
No, this is about professional
respect, which I'’ve earned.

27:04.971 --> 27:07.582

I didn'’t want you
to get all full of yourself.

38:04.978 --> 38:08.286
I can see why
Lucifer'’s so affected by you.

38:09.809 --> 38:11.724
It'’s because
you'’re special, Decker.

38:19.514 --> 38:21.429
Hey, Chloe.
Hi.

38:21.473 --> 38:23.518
Uh, Lieutenant,
I just wanted to say

38:23.562 --> 38:26.652
that, um, I hope
you feel better soon.

38:26.695 --> 38:28.306
Thanks, Espinoza.

38:28.349 --> 38:30.656
I also wanted to thank you
for putting me up

38:30.699 --> 38:32.353
for the union rep
position. Sorry, Chloe.

38:32.397 --> 38:34.181
I know you wanted that one, too.

38:35.313 --> 38:36.488
And I...

38:36.531 --> 38:37.750
I won'’t let you down, sir.

38:37.793 --> 38:38.968
I know you won'’t.

38:39.012 --> 38:40.492
You earned it, buddy.

38:40.535 --> 38:42.494
[laughs]

38:42.537 --> 38:44.757
Congratulations.
Thanks.

38:55.637 --> 38:59.162
So, my guardian angel, I think
this calls for a celebration.

38:59.206 --> 39:01.817
I was lucky you turned up
when you did.

39:01.861 --> 39:04.254
How did you find me,
by the way?

39:04.298 --> 39:07.345
Location service on one
of your dating apps.

39:07.388 --> 39:08.824
[laughs]

39:08.868 --> 39:12.698
Maybe luck had nothing to do
with when I showed up, Luci.

39:12.741 --> 39:14.482
Maybe Father wanted me there.

39:14.526 --> 39:18.051
You give him
way too much credit, Brother.

39:18.094 --> 39:20.836
[laughs]

39:20.880 --> 39:22.272
What'’s so funny?

39:22.316 --> 39:24.144
Well, nothing.

39:24.187 --> 39:26.668
It'’s just, it took you
walking a mile in my shoes

39:26.712 --> 39:28.191
to prove my point to me.

39:28.235 --> 39:30.019
Okay. And what point is that?

39:30.063 --> 39:31.499
That I haven'’t changed.

39:31.543 --> 39:33.109
Wings,

39:33.153 --> 39:35.373
no wings,
unable to show my true face...

39:35.416 --> 39:36.330
it doesn'’t matter.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.419
I'’m exactly
who I always was.

39:38.463 --> 39:40.508
A punisher.

39:40.552 --> 39:42.858
And for reminding me of that,
I salute you.

39:42.902 --> 39:44.860
Oh, that'’s very kind of you.

39:44.904 --> 39:47.820
But, you see,
I don'’t think it was the human

39:47.863 --> 39:49.387
that you were trying
to punish today.

39:49.430 --> 39:51.432
Well, who else would I be trying
to punish?

39:51.476 --> 39:52.912
Yourself, Luci.

39:54.566 --> 39:57.090
For not being there for Chloe
when she was in danger

39:57.133 --> 39:59.353
because you care
about her deeply.

39:59.397 --> 40:01.181
[scoffs]

40:01.224 --> 40:03.183
And if that truly is the case,

40:03.226 --> 40:06.795
then you really have changed
from the old Lord of Hell.

40:07.796 --> 40:10.233
But this is good, Luci.

40:10.277 --> 40:13.236
This is so good.

40:13.280 --> 40:16.326
Because I'’ve finally figured out
how you are my test.

40:16.370 --> 40:20.026
You see,
Father wants me to just...

40:20.069 --> 40:22.724
just be there for you.

40:22.768 --> 40:24.117
To have your back.

40:24.160 --> 40:27.120
Now that you'’re evolving.

40:35.955 --> 40:40.002
There was this, uh, soul that
I used to torture back in Hell.

40:41.700 --> 40:44.920
And like a good masochist,
he'’d call the shots.

40:44.964 --> 40:47.793
"Burn me."
"Freeze me."

40:47.836 --> 40:49.272
"Hurt me."

40:49.316 --> 40:51.231
So, I did.

40:51.274 --> 40:53.581
And this went on for centuries

40:53.625 --> 40:56.497
until one day, for some reason,

40:56.541 --> 41:00.501
he missed his daily punishment.

41:00.545 --> 41:02.503
And when I returned...

41:02.547 --> 41:04.462
he was crying.

41:06.072 --> 41:09.945
"Please, my king," he said.

41:09.989 --> 41:13.122
"Don'’t ever forget me again.

41:13.166 --> 41:15.342
I promise I'’ll be good."

41:18.432 --> 41:22.392
It was then that I realized
he was so full of self-loathing,

41:22.436 --> 41:25.787
void of any
self-respect, that

41:25.831 --> 41:29.095
no matter the depth
of my cruelty,

41:29.138 --> 41:33.447
whatever miniscule attention
I paid...

41:33.491 --> 41:36.015
gave meaning to his...

41:36.058 --> 41:39.105
pointless existence.

41:40.019 --> 41:43.457
Why are you telling me this?

41:47.243 --> 41:49.855
Because he reminds me of you.

41:52.858 --> 41:54.860
And you think I'’ve changed?

41:54.903 --> 41:59.168
You... the former angel,

41:59.212 --> 42:01.519
powerless and pathetic,

42:01.562 --> 42:04.565
a disgraced failure
with no better way

42:04.609 --> 42:08.438
to spend your days than
yipping at my heels for scraps

42:08.482 --> 42:12.530
to remind you of a time
of when you once mattered.

42:19.711 --> 42:21.582
Hmm.

42:21.626 --> 42:23.541
I know what you'’re doing.

42:26.413 --> 42:30.896
And you can kill the messenger
if you must.

42:32.245 --> 42:35.030
But just know
that I am here for you.
