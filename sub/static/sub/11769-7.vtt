HOME BOX OFFICE

00:05.833 --> 00:09.867
A Division of TIME WARNER
ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, L.P.

00:13.700 --> 00:17.133
AND NOW THIS ACTRESS
IS HAVING PROBLEMS

00:17.167 --> 00:19.167
GETTING ANOTHER SERIES
BECAUSE EVERYBODY,

00:19.200 --> 00:21.600
EVERYBODY
SEES HER AS EVELYN.

00:21.633 --> 00:23.500
( male )
OH, I SEE.

00:23.533 --> 00:25.167
THEY WANT HER
TO BRING EVELYN BACK.

00:25.200 --> 00:26.433
SHE CAN'T GET
AWAY FROM IT.

00:26.467 --> 00:30.900
IN FACT THE SERIES COULD
BE CALLED "AREN'T YOU EVELYN ?".

00:30.933 --> 00:34.267
OR, "I'M NOT EVELYN",
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

00:34.300 --> 00:35.600
I LOVE IT.

00:35.633 --> 00:36.600
IT'S FUNNY, RIGHT ?

00:36.633 --> 00:38.067
I AM JUST SO EXCITED
ABOUT THIS.

00:38.100 --> 00:40.133
THIS IS WONDERFUL,
THIS IS GOOD.

00:40.167 --> 00:41.600
I'M GLAD YOU
LIKE IT.

00:41.633 --> 00:43.433
I MEAN, I'M NOT SURPRISED
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU WERE GONNA

00:43.467 --> 00:45.567
COME IN HERE WITH
SOMETHING BRILLIANT, YOU DID.

00:45.600 --> 00:47.000
IT'S VERY FUNNY.

00:47.033 --> 00:48.700
( Lane )
I AM JUST
SO EXCITED.

00:48.733 --> 00:51.033
HEY, WHAT'S WITH YOU
AND THE WATER ?

00:51.067 --> 00:54.700
DOCTOR'S ORDERS,
I'M DEHYDRATED OR SOMETHING,

00:54.733 --> 00:56.933
AND I GOTTA DRINK
EIGHT OF THESE A DAY.

00:56.967 --> 00:58.500
CONSTANTLY RUNNING
TO THE BATHROOM.

00:58.533 --> 01:00.300
( Julia )
OH.

01:00.333 --> 01:02.767
THE OTHER THING IS
THAT JASON'S GOING TO
BE WORKING WITH US AS WELL.

01:02.800 --> 01:03.800
JASON ?

01:03.833 --> 01:04.800
ALEXANDER.

01:04.833 --> 01:06.467
ALEXANDER,
YOU'RE KIDDING ME ?

01:06.500 --> 01:07.600
NO, ISN'T
THAT GREAT ?

01:07.633 --> 01:09.067
WHAT'S HE DOING ?

01:09.067 --> 01:11.067
WELL, IT'S ABOUT
A MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER AND...

01:11.067 --> 01:12.367
WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN ?

01:12.400 --> 01:13.800
OH, PAST FEW WEEKS.

01:13.833 --> 01:15.967
WE'VE HAD
A FEW MEETINGS AND, UH,

01:16.067 --> 01:18.200
WE'RE VERY CLOSE
TO HAVING IT HAPPEN.

01:18.233 --> 01:19.967
WHERE DID YOU MEET,
IF I MAY ASK ?

01:20.067 --> 01:21.433
UH, HERE.

01:21.467 --> 01:22.667
HE CAME HERE ?

01:22.700 --> 01:24.500
YES, JASON,
HERE, YEAH.

01:24.533 --> 01:27.367
BUT FOUR MEETINGS NOW,
AND SUCH A WONDERFUL ACTOR.

01:27.400 --> 01:30.067
YEAH, NOTHING LIKE HIM,
HE'S THE GREATEST GUY.

01:30.067 --> 01:33.133
AND THEY'LL BOTH BE SO DIFFERENT
FROM HOW THEY WERE ON SEINFELD.

01:33.167 --> 01:34.900
SO, I'M JUST THRILLED
ABOUT THIS...

01:34.933 --> 01:36.667
I JUST THINK
THAT THIS IS GRAND.

01:36.700 --> 01:39.767
THIS IS A GREEN LIGHT,
ABSOLUTELY.

01:39.800 --> 01:40.767
I AM SO EXCITED
ABOUT THIS.

01:40.800 --> 01:41.767
WELL, WE'RE DELIGHTED...

01:41.800 --> 01:43.133
THANK YOU.THANK Y.

01:43.167 --> 01:44.900
OH, I'M SO PLEASED.

01:44.933 --> 01:47.067
SO NOW THAT YOU'RE ALL
PART OF THE ABC FAMILY...

01:47.067 --> 01:48.367
OH WELL.

01:48.400 --> 01:52.267
WE'RE HAVING A SCREENING OF
"HARRIET BEECHER STOWE" TONIGHT.

01:52.300 --> 01:54.733
OH MY GOD, MY WIFE'S GOOD FRIEND
WAS THE ART DIRECTOR ON THAT.

01:54.767 --> 01:55.733
I HEARD
IT'S GREAT.

01:55.767 --> 01:56.733
OH, HOW IS SUZY ?

01:56.767 --> 01:59.233
WE, UH, SPLIT UP.

01:59.267 --> 02:01.333
I'M LIVING
IN A HOTEL.

02:01.367 --> 02:02.400
OH, I'M SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.

02:02.433 --> 02:03.700
DON'T BE,
IT'S GREAT.

02:03.733 --> 02:07.100
BUT, IT'S A WONDERFUL
MINI-SERIES.

02:07.133 --> 02:09.100
PART ONE IS TONIGHT,
PART TWO IS TOMORROW NIGHT.

02:09.133 --> 02:10.600
IT'S JUST
BEAUTIFULLY SHOT.

02:10.633 --> 02:11.600
REALLY.

02:11.633 --> 02:12.833
LOVE YOU TO COME.

02:12.867 --> 02:16.500
THE ONLY THING IS THAT
MY OLDER KID HAS PINK EYE, SO...

02:16.533 --> 02:17.667
AWW.

02:17.700 --> 02:18.667
I MEAN, IT'S NOT CONTAGIOUS,
BUT, YOU KNOW.

02:18.700 --> 02:20.633
OH SORRY,
YOU'LL COME LARRY ?

02:20.667 --> 02:22.367
YEAH, SURE.

02:22.400 --> 02:23.733
WE'LL GO, SURE.

02:23.767 --> 02:25.200

WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOMETHING

02:25.233 --> 02:26.867

WE'LL SEE YOU THERE.

02:30.933 --> 02:32.133
ALRIGHT,
WONDERFUL.

02:32.167 --> 02:34.067
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN,
HARRIET BEECHER STOWE

02:34.067 --> 02:36.167
AND HARRIET TUBMAN ?

02:38.433 --> 02:40.167
YOU KNOW, I THINK WE MIGHT
BE DUE FOR SOME SEX TONIGHT.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.167
YOU THINK ?

02:41.200 --> 02:42.200
I DO, YEAH.

02:42.233 --> 02:43.833
DID YOU PENCIL THAT IN
AND DIDN'T TELL ME ?

02:43.867 --> 02:45.500
HEY.

02:45.533 --> 02:46.833

02:52.100 --> 02:54.100
SO, I'M GONNA GO IN
OVER THERE, I'M NOT HERE.

02:54.133 --> 02:55.100
I HAVEN'T
SEEN YOU.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.200
HAVE NOT SEEN ME.

02:56.233 --> 02:57.700
ALRIGHT, BYE,
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

02:57.733 --> 02:59.700

02:59.733 --> 03:01.733
LARRY, I'M SO GLAD

I REALLY NEED TO HAVE THIS.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.833
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
FINISH IT OUT HERE, I'M SORRY.

03:36.867 --> 03:39.367
OKAY, WHY DON'T
YOU GO IN AND...

03:39.400 --> 03:40.367
GET A SEAT.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.067
AND I'LL MEET YOU
IN THERE.

03:42.100 --> 03:44.900
I MEAN, WHAT IF I HAVE, LIKE,
A REALLY BAD KIDNEY THING ?

03:44.933 --> 03:45.933

03:51.133 --> 03:52.100
DO YOU LIKE
THESE SEATS ?

03:52.133 --> 03:53.733
WOW, GREAT SEATS.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.967
I'M GIVING YOU
THE AISLE CONSIDERING
ALL THE WATER YOU'VE HAD.

03:56.067 --> 03:57.267
OH YEAH.

03:57.300 --> 03:58.300
I'M LOOKING OUT
FOR YOU.

03:58.333 --> 03:59.433
THIS IS GREAT,
WHAT A NICE LITTLE THEATER.

03:59.467 --> 04:01.767
YEAH,
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

04:04.800 --> 04:07.067
IS THAT THE SAME WOMAN
WHO JUST TOLD ME TO

04:07.067 --> 04:08.867
GET RID
OF THE WATER ?

04:08.900 --> 04:11.367
YEAH,
I THINK IT IS.

04:11.400 --> 04:14.500
WHAT'S THE DEAL ?
WHAT IS SHE DOING ?

04:14.533 --> 04:16.367
DOES SHE WORK HERE
OR IS SHE A GUEST ?

04:16.400 --> 04:18.600
YEAH, I THOUGHT
SHE WAS WORKING.

04:18.633 --> 04:20.067
ME TOO.

04:20.067 --> 04:21.600
EXCUSE ME.

04:21.633 --> 04:22.633
LARRY...

04:22.667 --> 04:24.067
EXCUSE ME?

04:24.100 --> 04:25.267
DO YOU WORK HERE ?

04:25.300 --> 04:26.467
NO.

04:26.500 --> 04:30.333
HOW COME YOU TOLD ME TO
GET RID OF THE WATER THEN ?

04:30.367 --> 04:31.433
I SAW YOU COMING IN
WITH WATER.

04:31.467 --> 04:33.200
THERE'S NO WATER,
THAT'S THE RULES.

04:33.233 --> 04:36.067
I DON'T SEE HOW IT
WAS YOUR CONCERN.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.067
YOU DON'T WORK HERE.

04:37.067 --> 04:38.467
IT'S THE RULES.

04:38.500 --> 04:40.767
THE SIGN SAYS, "NO FOOD
OR DRINK IN THE THEATER".

04:40.800 --> 04:42.167
I'M SURE WE WOULD ALL
LIKE TO HAVE A WATER.

04:42.200 --> 04:43.933
OH YEAH, WE'RE ALL
DYING OF THIRST.

04:43.967 --> 04:46.333
WHAT ARE YOU
THE HALLWAY MONITOR HERE ?

04:46.367 --> 04:48.167
WHO ARE YOU THAT
THE RULES DON'T APPLY ?

04:48.200 --> 04:50.200
I'M APPLYING THE GOLDEN RULE,
ARE YOU ?

04:50.233 --> 04:52.667
I DON'T THINK
THE GOLDEN RULE APPLIES HERE.

04:52.700 --> 04:53.833
IF YOU HAD WATER,

04:53.867 --> 04:54.900
WOULD YOU WANT ME TO TELL
YOU NOT TO BRING IT IN ?

04:54.933 --> 04:55.933
I DON'T THINK SO.

04:55.967 --> 04:57.067
HOW ABOUT COMMON COURTESY,
BUDDY ?

04:57.100 --> 04:59.867
OH, BUT THAT DOESN'T
SUPERSEDE THE GOLDEN RULE.

04:59.900 --> 05:00.933
THAT'S THE BIG ONE.

05:00.967 --> 05:01.933
YOU'RE NUTS.

05:01.967 --> 05:02.933
YOU'RE NUTS.

05:02.967 --> 05:03.933
ALRIGHT.

05:03.967 --> 05:05.067
JACKASS.

05:05.067 --> 05:07.700
NOW, DON'T BRING
ANY PENS OR PENCILS IN.

05:07.733 --> 05:08.700
( male )
QUIET.

05:08.733 --> 05:09.833
LOSER.

05:09.867 --> 05:12.500
EXCUSE ME, MRS. CANTOR,
WE'VE GOT HOMEWORK.

05:12.533 --> 05:14.267
YOU FORGOT TO
GIVE US HOMEWORK.

05:14.300 --> 05:17.533
SORRY, SOME PEOPLE
ARE JUST RUDE.

05:19.867 --> 05:21.467
AND SHE'S SITTING THERE.

05:21.500 --> 05:26.900
NOW, IS SHE A GUEST ?
DOES SHE WORK THERE ?

05:26.933 --> 05:29.833
SHE'S JUST SOME PERSON THAT
WOULDN'T LET ME BRING IT IN.

05:29.867 --> 05:31.700
WE HAD THIS HUGE FIGHT.

05:31.733 --> 05:34.900
SHE'S RIGHT, THERE SHE IS,
RIGHT THERE ON THE RIGHT.

05:34.933 --> 05:37.300
SHE'S TALKING

05:37.333 --> 05:39.067

05:39.100 --> 05:40.633
THAT'S HER,
THAT'S WHO SHE'S TALKING TO.

05:40.667 --> 05:41.667
THAT'S
LANE MICHAELSON'S WIFE ?

05:41.700 --> 05:43.767
THAT'S
LANE MICHAELSON'S WIFE.

05:45.400 --> 05:46.600

05:59.367 --> 06:01.133
YEAH, WE'RE NOT GOING
TO DINNER WITH YOU THOUGH.

06:01.167 --> 06:03.967
WE HAD ALREADY
MADE PLANS.

06:04.067 --> 06:05.567
THAT'S ALRIGHT.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.700
WE DON'T HAVE ANY PLANS,
WE JUST DON'T WANNA GO
TO DINNER WITH YOU.

06:07.733 --> 06:08.700
FROZEN MARGARITAS ?

06:08.733 --> 06:10.700

06:13.767 --> 06:15.067
STOP IT.

06:15.067 --> 06:16.800
IN THAT TIME I DON'T THINK
THEY WORE IT THAT LOW

06:16.833 --> 06:18.867
AND SHE'S REALLY, IT WAS
A LITTLE MUCH IF YOU ASK ME.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.833

IT'S A COUNTRY IN EUROPE
AND THEY DON'T LIKE TO FIGHT.

09:20.633 --> 09:23.067
THEY LET EVERYBODY
DO THEIR FIGHTING FOR THEM,

09:23.067 --> 09:25.167
WHILE THEY SKI

ON THAT BATHROOM DOOR.

10:15.700 --> 10:16.900
I KNOW.

10:16.933 --> 10:18.900
THAT'S CRAZY.

10:18.933 --> 10:20.067
I KNOW,
IT'S INSANE.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.500
THAT'S YOUR TOP PRIORITY
IN A HOUSE.

10:21.533 --> 10:22.800
IN THE BATHROOM.

10:22.833 --> 10:23.933

10:26.133 --> 10:27.567
TWO MINUTES.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.200
LOOK AT
MY DOLL'S HAIR.

10:38.233 --> 10:39.367
WHY DID YOU
CUT HER HAIR ?

10:39.400 --> 10:42.867
I DIDN'T CUT IT,
HE DID, HE CUT IT.

10:42.900 --> 10:43.867
IS THIS TRUE ?

10:43.900 --> 10:44.900
YEAH, WELL,
SHE ASKED ME,

10:44.933 --> 10:45.900
SHE ASKED ME TO
GIVE IT A HAIRCUT.

10:45.933 --> 10:46.967
IT'S TRUE MOMMY.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.067
YOU WALKED INTO
MY DAUGHTER'S ROOM,

10:48.100 --> 10:49.400
AND YOU CUT HER
JUDY'S HAIR.

10:49.433 --> 10:50.400
IT'S NOT FAIR.

10:50.433 --> 10:51.700
WELL, SHE ASKED ME
TO GIVE IT A HAIRCUT.

10:51.733 --> 10:53.267
UH HUH, AND DID YOU
HAPPEN TO TELL HER

10:53.300 --> 10:54.800
THAT MAYBE IT
WOULDN'T GROW BACK ?

10:54.833 --> 10:56.767
HE DIDN'T TELL HER
IT WOULDN'T GROW BACK.

10:56.800 --> 10:58.200
I THOUGHT IT
WAS UNDERSTOOD.

10:58.233 --> 11:00.400
HOW COULD YOU
NOT UNDERSTAND

11:00.433 --> 11:02.433
THAT A LITTLE GIRL
HAS A VIVID IMAGINATION.

11:02.467 --> 11:04.633
SHE'S EXTREMELY GIFTED...

11:04.667 --> 11:06.067
SORRY.

11:06.067 --> 11:08.133
AND THIS LITTLE GIRL DOESN'T
KNOW THAT HER DOLLY'S HAIR

11:08.167 --> 11:09.200
IS NOT GONNA
GROW BACK.

11:09.233 --> 11:11.100
DO YOU KNOW WHO THIS IS ?
THIS IS JUDY.

11:11.133 --> 11:12.100
I THOUGHT...

11:12.133 --> 11:13.467
SHE IS
A COLLECTOR'S ITEM.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.600
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO FIND ANOTHER ONE LIKE THIS.

11:15.633 --> 11:16.667
I CAN...

11:16.700 --> 11:17.800
I GOT THIS DOLL
BEFORE SHE WAS BORN.

11:17.833 --> 11:19.400
WELL, I CAN REPLACE IT,
I'M SURE I CAN.

11:19.433 --> 11:20.467
OH YOU CAN

O.O.P., OKAY ?

11:24.267 --> 11:25.533
NOT COMING BACK.

11:25.567 --> 11:27.167
IT'S NEVER
GONNA GROW BACK.

11:27.200 --> 11:28.700
WHAT IS THAT ?

11:28.733 --> 11:31.600
I GUESS I MISSED A STRAND THERE,
I GOT A SWISS ARMY...

11:31.633 --> 11:32.733

11:38.767 --> 11:39.733
LET'S GO, TARA.

11:39.767 --> 11:40.967
I...

11:41.067 --> 11:43.533
SHE SAID IT LOOKED GOOD
EARLIER, SHE LIKED IT.

11:43.567 --> 11:45.400
NOT A SURPRISE.

11:45.433 --> 11:47.767
I THOUGHT IT WAS
UNDERSTOOD THAT...

11:49.200 --> 11:51.100
LARRY...

11:51.133 --> 11:54.200
GO AHEAD.

11:55.067 --> 11:56.833
JESUS CHRIST.

11:56.867 --> 12:00.467
WHO DOESN'T KNOW THAT
WHEN YOU CUT A DOLL'S HAIR

12:00.500 --> 12:02.200
IT DOESN'T GROW BACK.

12:02.233 --> 12:03.567
SHE SHOULD
KNOW BETTER.

12:03.600 --> 12:04.967
I MEAN, I THOUGHT
THE DOLL LOOKED A LOT BETTER,

12:05.067 --> 12:06.067
TO TELL YOU
THE TRUTH.a

12:06.100 --> 12:07.333
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT
LOOKED LIKE BEFORE, SO...

12:07.367 --> 12:09.400
WELL, IT WAS UGLY,
IT WAS WAY DOWN TO HER WAIST.

12:09.433 --> 12:11.267
WHAT'S THE DOLL'S NAME,
JUDY ?

12:11.300 --> 12:12.367
YEAH.

12:12.400 --> 12:14.067

HELP YOU WITH THIS, OKAY.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.600
MY DAUGHTER HAS
A HUGE DOLL COLLECTION.

12:16.633 --> 12:18.933
HER ROOM IS
FILLED WITH DOLLS.

12:18.967 --> 12:21.300
I THINK SHE MIGHT HAVE
THAT JUDY DOLL.

12:21.333 --> 12:22.367
YOU THINK SHE'S GOT
A JUDY DOLL ?

12:22.400 --> 12:24.133
IT SOUNDS FAMILIAR TO ME,
I'M NOT POSITIVE.

12:24.167 --> 12:28.333
WE CAN GO IN TOMORROW,
ZIP IN, ZIP OUT, BOOM.

12:28.367 --> 12:30.067
WOULD SHE MISS
THE DOLL IF...

12:30.067 --> 12:32.333
NO, MY DAUGHTER'S
NOT GONNA CARE.

12:32.367 --> 12:33.467
SHE'S NOT GONNA
NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE.

12:33.500 --> 12:34.800
SHE HASN'T PLAYED WITH IT
IN A LONG TIME ANYHOW.

12:34.833 --> 12:36.933
WE'LL GO BY THE HOUSE TOMORROW,
WE'LL CHECK IT OUT.

12:36.967 --> 12:40.200

NO, I MEAN, IT'S JUST ALL OF
A SUDDEN I GOT THIS DEAL AND...

12:42.733 --> 12:44.767
THE WHOLE ABC DEAL
COULD GO DOWN THE DRAIN.

12:44.800 --> 12:45.767

12:45.800 --> 12:47.133
WELL, I...

12:56.167 --> 12:58.667

16:28.633 --> 16:29.900

16:33.467 --> 16:35.533
( Suzy )
JEFFREY, I SAW YOUR CAR, WHAT

16:35.567 --> 16:38.767
YOU'RE SUPPOSED

16:38.800 --> 16:40.167
JEFFREY ?

16:40.200 --> 16:41.267
SO WHAT YOU WANNA
BE DOING IS...

16:41.300 --> 16:42.400
HUH ?

16:42.433 --> 16:44.133

16:46.067 --> 16:47.533
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE ?

16:47.567 --> 16:49.533

16:49.567 --> 16:51.367
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE ?

16:51.400 --> 16:52.667
LISTEN AND
I'LL TELL YOU.

16:52.700 --> 16:54.567
SAMI'S SHELF HAS
BEEN ON MY MIND.

16:54.600 --> 16:57.333
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT
THIS SHELF WAS LOOSE.

16:57.367 --> 17:00.600
AND I CAME HERE
AND I PUSHED IT AND TESTED IT.

17:00.633 --> 17:02.367
ALL THE DOLLS FELL,
RIGHT THERE.

17:02.400 --> 17:03.767
JEFFREY, WHY DON'T
I BELIEVE YOU ?

17:03.800 --> 17:05.200
I DON'T KNOW.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.567
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE
IN SAMI'S ROOM OF ALL PLACES ?

17:07.600 --> 17:09.967
AND YOU BROUGHT LARRY
TO HELP YOU WITH THE SHELF ?

17:10.067 --> 17:11.233
I KNOW A LOT
ABOUT SHELVING.

17:11.267 --> 17:13.200
I PUT UP ALL THE SHELVES
IN MY HOUSE AND...

17:13.233 --> 17:14.767
YOU PUT THE SHELVES UP
IN YOUR--

17:14.800 --> 17:15.767
I FIND THAT HARD
TO BELIEVE, LARRY.

17:15.800 --> 17:16.900
HE KNOWS A LOT
ABOUT SHELVING.

17:16.933 --> 17:18.067
I PUT THEM ALL UP
AND I WAS JUST...

17:18.100 --> 17:21.067
MR. CALIFORNIA CLOSETS
OVER HERE ALL OF A SUDDEN...

17:21.067 --> 17:23.433
WELL GET THE HELL,
LEAVE, LEAVE.

17:23.467 --> 17:25.100
BY THE WAY,

17:25.133 --> 17:27.067
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I DIDN'T SEE YOU AT
THE SCREENING LAST NIGHT ?

17:27.100 --> 17:28.200
YOU THINK I DIDN'T
NOTICE YOU, HUH ?

17:28.233 --> 17:29.467
OKAY.

17:29.500 --> 17:32.067

YOU'RE MR. INCONSPICUOUS.

17:32.067 --> 17:33.367

FOR PART TWO ?

17:35.133 --> 17:36.467
I MIGHT BE.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.367
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK,
DO YOU THINK IT'S GONNA WORK ?

17:45.400 --> 17:47.600
UH, I HOPE IT WORKS,
IT WAS PAINFUL.

17:47.633 --> 17:51.433
SO, YOU DON'T THINK
MICHAELSON'S WIFE,

17:51.467 --> 17:52.600
DO YOU THINK
SHE'S GONNA HAVE,

17:52.633 --> 17:53.900
SHE'S NOT GONNA HAVE
ANY PROBLEM WITH THIS, RIGHT ?

17:53.933 --> 17:55.200
WITH THE HEAD,
JUST THE HEAD.

17:55.233 --> 17:56.333
THAT'S FINE.

17:56.367 --> 17:57.500
SHE'S GOT THE BODY,
YOU'RE FINE.

17:57.533 --> 17:59.567
WE'LL JUST ATTACH IT.

17:59.600 --> 18:00.700
ATTACH THE HEAD.

18:00.733 --> 18:03.833
YEAH, GOOD,
THAT'S FINE.

18:03.867 --> 18:05.767
BOY, THAT'S STARTING
TO ITCH ME DOWN THERE.

18:05.800 --> 18:08.400
( screaming )

18:08.433 --> 18:10.133
( Suzy )
WHAT'S WRONG,
SAMI, DARLING ?

18:10.167 --> 18:13.633
MOMMY, SOMEBODY
CUT OFF JUDY'S HEAD !

18:19.733 --> 18:21.067
YEAH.

18:21.067 --> 18:24.700
JUDY, I GOT JUDY.

18:24.733 --> 18:27.200
WHERE'S HER BODY ?

18:28.167 --> 18:30.567
IT DIDN'T COME
WITH A BODY.

18:30.600 --> 18:33.533
UH HUH.

18:38.167 --> 18:40.200
IS THIS
AN AUTHENTIC JUDY ?

18:40.233 --> 18:42.367
BELIEVE ME,
THAT IS JUDY.

18:42.400 --> 18:46.633
ALRIGHT, WELL, UH,
WHY DON'T YOU COME IN.

18:46.667 --> 18:49.167
I'LL TAKE IT UPSTAIRS
AND MAKE SURE IT FITS.

18:49.200 --> 18:52.067
OH, DON'T WORRY,
IT'S GONNA FIT.

18:53.067 --> 18:54.933
WELL, WE'LL JUST
SEE ABOUT THAT.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.667
MAY I USE
YOUR BATHROOM ?

18:56.700 --> 18:57.633
YEAH.

19:01.167 --> 19:03.833

19:08.300 --> 19:09.267
OH.

HEY, HOW ARE
YOU DOING ?

19:10.300 --> 19:11.467

19:11.500 --> 19:12.467
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
PUTTING A NEW LOCK IN ?

19:12.500 --> 19:14.067
YEAH, A NEW LOCK.

19:14.067 --> 19:15.067
OH BEAUTIFUL,

19:40.200 --> 19:41.967
SO, THANK YOU.

19:42.067 --> 19:42.967

19:43.067 --> 19:44.533
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME,
AND AGAIN,

19:44.567 --> 19:48.700
I'M JUST SORRY ABOUT THE WHOLE
THING AND CUTTING IT AND,

19:48.733 --> 19:49.833
BUT...

19:49.867 --> 19:52.367
WELL, YOU THINK
THIS IS GONNA BE OKAY ?

19:52.400 --> 19:53.867
DO YOU THINK SHE'S GONNA
NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE ?

19:53.900 --> 19:56.667
NO, SHE'LL NEVER KNOW
THE DIFFERENCE REALLY.

19:56.700 --> 19:58.333
I MEAN, IF SHE DOES,
YOU SHOULD ENROLL HER

19:58.367 --> 20:00.567
AT SOME KIND OF SCHOOL
FOR GIFTED CHILDREN.

20:00.600 --> 20:01.867
WELL, SHE'S ALREADY
AT MERMAN.

20:01.900 --> 20:03.233
SHE IS GIFTED,
SHE'S HIGHLY GIFTED.

20:03.267 --> 20:04.233
OH.

20:04.267 --> 20:06.300
WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE
TO PULL IT OFF.

20:06.333 --> 20:07.767
YEAH, IT'S A SHAME
SHE DIDN'T KNOW

20:07.800 --> 20:11.467
THAT HAIR WASN'T
GONNA GROW BACK, YEAH.

20:11.500 --> 20:15.300
I MEAN, 'CAUSE
SHE'S A BRIGHT GIRL.

20:15.333 --> 20:18.133
SHE HAS
A VIVID IMAGINATION.

20:18.167 --> 20:20.700
NO, I'M SURE SHE DOES.

20:20.733 --> 20:23.600
ANYWAY SO AGAIN,
I'M SORRY.

20:23.633 --> 20:25.067
YOU'LL BE AT PART TWO ?

20:25.100 --> 20:26.067
YEAH,

20:26.100 --> 20:27.567
YEAH, OKAY, GREAT.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.367
ALRIGHT, ALL'S WELL
THAT ENDS WELL.

20:29.400 --> 20:30.867
BYE BYE.

20:30.900 --> 20:32.900
YOU KNOW I ACTUALLY THINK
SHE LOOKED PRETTY GOOD

20:32.933 --> 20:34.600
WITH THE SHORT HAIR.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.067
OH SHIT..

20:48.100 --> 20:49.467

21:12.100 --> 21:16.867
THE KID IS HOME HYSTERICAL,
BECAUSE HER DOLL, JUDY,

21:16.900 --> 21:19.100
HAS BEEN DECAPITATED

21:19.133 --> 21:21.367
'CAUSE YOU TWO SICKOS'

21:21.400 --> 21:24.633
TOOK THE HEAD FOR
GOD KNOWS WHAT REASON,

21:24.667 --> 21:26.967
SOME VOODOO SHIT

21:52.567 --> 21:53.733
WHAT THE HELL
ARE WE GONNA DO NOW ?

21:53.767 --> 21:56.067
I COULD DRIVE BACK
TO THE MICHAELSON'S.

21:56.100 --> 21:58.833
I DON'T THINK SHE'S GONNA
GIVE US THE HEAD BACK.

21:58.867 --> 22:00.733
NO, I GUESS NOT.

22:01.733 --> 22:02.900
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

22:02.933 --> 22:04.067
MY PENIS ITCHES ME.

22:04.100 --> 22:08.533
HEY, MAYBE SHE'S GOT
THE SHORT HAIRED VERSION.

22:08.567 --> 22:10.500
WE CAN GET
THE SHORT HAIRED JUDY BACK.

22:10.533 --> 22:11.700
YEAH.

22:11.733 --> 22:13.333

THROWN IT OUT.

22:13.367 --> 22:15.767
NAW, WE WERE

22:17.700 --> 22:20.067

AND YOUR DAUGHTER ?

22:20.067 --> 22:21.233
THEY WON'T KNOW
THE DIFFERENCE.

22:21.267 --> 22:23.067
YOUR DAUGHTER'S NOT GONNA KNOW
THAT THE HAIR WAS CUT ?

22:23.100 --> 22:26.167
MY DAUGHTER OR SUZY ARE NOT
GONNA KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.

22:26.200 --> 22:27.233
YOU THINK SO ?

22:27.267 --> 22:28.300
I KNOW IT WE CAN
GET AWAY WITH THAT.

22:28.333 --> 22:30.533
JESUS CHRIST,
MY PENIS IS ITCHING.

22:30.567 --> 22:32.100

22:46.567 --> 22:47.800
THAT'S GONNA
BE A LOT OF FUN.

22:47.833 --> 22:49.867
WHERE DID YOU
GET THE RASH ?

22:49.900 --> 22:53.167
OH, I STUCK A DOLL'S HEAD
