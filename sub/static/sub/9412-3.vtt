16:37.167 --> 16:39.133
but the front door was open,
and, um...

16:41.133 --> 16:43.800
So I guess you're Danny's mom.

16:43.800 --> 16:47.833
I'm Hannah, your neighbor.
He must have told you about me.

16:49.333 --> 16:52.600
Or not? Mrs. Anderson?

16:53.100 --> 16:54.933
Hello?

16:58.300 --> 17:00.500
Wait a second.

17:08.767 --> 17:12.267
You're not listening to me
because you're not really here.

17:12.267 --> 17:14.933
- You're a ghost too.
- What are you doing here?

17:14.933 --> 17:17.933
[ Gasps ]
Don't act like you don't know, OK?

17:17.933 --> 17:19.433
I figured it out.

17:19.433 --> 17:22.166
I know all about you and your mother.
You're ghosts.

17:22.166 --> 17:25.200
What? You wanna tell me
what the heck you're talking about?

17:25.200 --> 17:27.099
Stop acting innocent, OK?

17:27.099 --> 17:28.967
I saw you in your basement.

17:28.967 --> 17:31.667
And what's with all
these candles, huh?

17:31.667 --> 17:33.167
Your mother sets the table

17:33.167 --> 17:36.667
even though that oven
hasn't been used in years.

17:36.667 --> 17:39.467
And why does she act
like we're not even here?

17:39.467 --> 17:41.767
You don't live in this house.
You're haunting it.

17:42.233 --> 17:45.500
- Well, you found us out.
- I sure did.

17:45.933 --> 17:48.433
Yeah, you figured out that our electricity
hasn't been turned on yet,

17:48.933 --> 17:51.633
so we can't use the stove
and that's also why we need candles.

17:51.633 --> 17:54.467
And my mother hasn't been listening
to a word we've said

17:54.467 --> 17:57.867
- because she's deaf.
- She's what?

17:57.867 --> 18:00.167
Deaf, you know,
as in she can't hear.

18:00.167 --> 18:01.167
I'm glad she can't.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.167
Because it would have
really hurt her feelings,

18:03.167 --> 18:05.300
you coming here and acting
all weird like this.

18:05.300 --> 18:09.533
Danny, I'm-- I'm so sorry,
I don't know what to say.

18:12.967 --> 18:16.800
Nothing's wrong, Mom.
I'll be right back.

18:19.333 --> 18:20.833
Hannah, wait.

18:21.333 --> 18:24.833
[ Sighs ]
You must think I'm a complete loser.

18:24.833 --> 18:26.667
Well, not a complete one.

18:26.667 --> 18:28.167
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

18:28.167 --> 18:30.600
- You go first.
- You go first.

18:30.600 --> 18:31.533
You first.

18:31.967 --> 18:34.467
OK, I--
I was just gonna say I'm sorry.

18:34.967 --> 18:38.833
I should have told you about my mom
and why I don't let people in the house.

18:38.833 --> 18:43.200
I-- I just took you to the basement
'cause... I don't know.

18:43.200 --> 18:46.933
I know it sounds dumb,
but I guess I'm embarrassed.

18:46.933 --> 18:49.433
Don't be, I think it's cool.

18:49.433 --> 18:52.367
I wanna learn sign language now
so I can talk to your mom.

18:52.367 --> 18:55.833
- Maybe I could teach you.
- I'd like that.

18:56.333 --> 18:58.333
OK, it's your turn.
What were you gonna say?

18:58.333 --> 19:02.233
Well, I just wanted to say that
I'm sorry I thought you were a ghost.

19:02.233 --> 19:05.500
It's just I got this story
off the Internet about our street,

19:06.000 --> 19:08.500
and about this big house fire.

19:08.500 --> 19:10.833
And I just kinda thought
you were dead.

19:10.833 --> 19:12.833
That's OK.
Actually it's kinda cool.

19:12.833 --> 19:14.700
No one's ever thought
I was a ghost before.

19:14.700 --> 19:17.267
Yeah, well, it won't happen again.
I promise.

19:17.267 --> 19:19.500
It's been a weird summer,
you know.

19:19.500 --> 19:22.633
I promise I'll start acting
like a normal person.

19:22.633 --> 19:23.967
Is that a promise?

19:23.967 --> 19:26.667
Promise.
I'll see you tomorrow.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.600
- [ Screams ]
- Pizza.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.600
[ Hannah ]
Excuse me.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.867
Yeah, normal.

19:45.000 --> 19:50.000
Dear Kate, today, I made
a complete idiot of myself.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Hannah, hold on.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.500
Let me guess, you've decided
my apology isn't enough,

19:55.500 --> 19:57.000
and you never wanna
speak to me again.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.000
No, look at this.

19:59.500 --> 20:01.000
You said you lived at 49, right?

20:01.500 --> 20:03.500
- Right.
- B-but you can't live there.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.500
Why not?

20:05.500 --> 20:09.033
Because 49 Cordina Way
burned down 3 years ago.

20:09.033 --> 20:11.533
That's impossible,
my house is right here.

20:18.133 --> 20:19.567
No.

20:19.567 --> 20:21.600
[ Gasps ]

20:22.033 --> 20:25.233
Hannah, don't. It's not safe.

20:39.433 --> 20:43.000
You're right,
there is a ghost around here.

20:43.500 --> 20:46.233
It's you.
