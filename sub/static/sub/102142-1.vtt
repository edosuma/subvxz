WEBVTT

01:11.030 --> 01:13.166
What do you
think is in that darkness?

01:16.069 --> 01:19.172
I don't know, but it
must be something bad,

01:19.204 --> 01:22.075
otherwise why would I
block it out of my memory?

01:22.108 --> 01:23.743
We can try and figure it out.

01:23.776 --> 01:26.646
Another attempt to get
me to agree to hypnosis?

01:26.679 --> 01:29.481
You can't blame a girl
for trying, William.

01:29.514 --> 01:31.283
When are you gonna
start calling me Will?

01:32.185 --> 01:33.418
When you call me Lydia.

01:34.721 --> 01:37.023
You seem very pensive today.

01:38.091 --> 01:40.059
I'm just tired.

01:40.093 --> 01:43.129
A lot happening, the
anniversary, yes?

01:43.162 --> 01:44.563
Denise, two years?

01:45.865 --> 01:47.200
Yeah.

01:48.233 --> 01:49.534
How are the girls doing?

01:50.535 --> 01:52.038
They're fine.

01:52.270 --> 01:54.272
Have either of them said
anything

01:54.306 --> 01:56.241
about your wife's passing?

01:57.542 --> 01:58.945
Why would they?

01:58.978 --> 02:01.613
Well with your own mother
passing,

02:01.647 --> 02:04.483
it's a shared experience you all
have.

02:04.516 --> 02:07.186
I didn't lose my mother
when I was a teenager.

02:07.220 --> 02:09.789
But you lost your father,
though when you were a kid.

02:09.822 --> 02:12.357
I'm well aware of that.

02:12.390 --> 02:14.694
I'm just surprised the
topic hasn't come up.

02:14.727 --> 02:17.897
I think it's more important
that we move on with our lives

02:19.198 --> 02:21.433
and leave the past where it
belongs.

02:21.466 --> 02:24.003
It's not my intention to
agitate you.

02:24.036 --> 02:26.571
See, I think it is if
you think it'll help,

02:26.605 --> 02:27.673
which it doesn't.

02:29.008 --> 02:32.377
Ironically, I've actually had a
dream

02:32.410 --> 02:34.279
about my father the other night.

02:35.580 --> 02:37.049
Really?

02:37.083 --> 02:38.483
What were the circumstances?

02:40.219 --> 02:42.420
Nothing really, he
was just sort of there.

02:42.454 --> 02:45.124
You lose your one parent
and then you start dreaming

02:45.158 --> 02:46.391
about the one that you barely
knew

02:46.424 --> 02:48.460
or that you hardly ever give a
thought to.

02:48.493 --> 02:50.428
I mean, up until a couple of
weeks ago,

02:51.596 --> 02:54.100
I had only had like a
single picture of him

02:54.133 --> 02:56.135
and I misplaced that years ago.

02:56.169 --> 02:58.037
What happened a few weeks ago?

02:58.070 --> 03:01.540
I came across some boxes of
his stuff in my mother's attic.

03:01.573 --> 03:03.943
What was in those, in those
boxes?

03:03.976 --> 03:06.245
I haven't had the time
to bring them home yet.

03:06.279 --> 03:08.380
You haven't had the time
or you haven't made the time?

03:08.413 --> 03:11.184
I figure if my mom
put all that stuff away,

03:13.152 --> 03:15.855
maybe she put that
stuff away for a reason.

03:15.888 --> 03:17.924
I mean, maybe she was trying to
keep

03:17.957 --> 03:21.526
something about my father
from me for a reason.

03:21.560 --> 03:23.663
Or maybe she didn't
want to deal with you,

03:23.696 --> 03:25.698
you know, asking questions about
him,

03:25.731 --> 03:27.465
wanting to know more about him.

03:28.400 --> 03:31.436
Maybe she thought that
would be too painful.

03:32.872 --> 03:34.207
For me?

03:35.540 --> 03:36.876
For her.

03:37.844 --> 03:39.979
Have you ever considered
that you might be teeing up

03:40.012 --> 03:42.949
the same exact circumstances
for your daughters?

03:47.053 --> 03:48.287
The
Soviet union announced

03:48.321 --> 03:50.957
it will not participate in the
Los Angeles summer Olympics

03:50.990 --> 03:52.758
in retaliation for the American
boycott

03:52.792 --> 03:55.294
of the 1980 Moscow Olympics.

03:55.328 --> 03:58.097
In national news, as the
campaign for November heats up,

03:58.130 --> 03:59.497
president Reagan said today-

03:59.531 --> 04:01.533
- Just go ahead and set the
boxes there.

04:03.435 --> 04:04.937
There's one more.

04:04.971 --> 04:05.938
Can you get it please?

04:05.972 --> 04:07.006
Why can't Shanna get it?

04:07.039 --> 04:08.373
Mindy.

04:12.311 --> 04:13.578
Stuff must be old.

04:13.612 --> 04:14.881
About 40 years.

04:15.848 --> 04:17.183
Looks like a lot of junk.

04:19.051 --> 04:21.386
I'm sure has some value to it

04:21.419 --> 04:24.190
if Nana held on to it
for that long, right?

04:24.223 --> 04:25.557
I miss her.

04:28.194 --> 04:29.662
Me too.

04:29.695 --> 04:32.031
You know, she lived a long life,
right?

04:32.064 --> 04:33.900
Now, she's with your
grandfather.

04:33.933 --> 04:35.935
Yeah, she used to talk
about him sometimes.

04:35.968 --> 04:37.469
Grandpa Harold.

04:38.070 --> 04:39.305
Gerald.

04:39.338 --> 04:40.640
What?

04:40.673 --> 04:44.176
My dad's name was Gerald,
so it'd be Grandpa Gerald.

04:46.312 --> 04:48.047
- Thank you.
- Am I done now?

04:48.080 --> 04:49.081
Yes, you're done now.

04:49.115 --> 04:51.516
Good, I hate it down
here, it smells so musty.

06:20.006 --> 06:22.441
This is W-2-A-S-D.

06:22.475 --> 06:25.711
Whiskey two Alpha Sierra Delta.

06:27.380 --> 06:32.385
This is H-8-A-9-Q-R-L.
How are you, Eva?

06:33.618 --> 06:35.955
I feel like people are
watching me.

06:35.988 --> 06:38.190
I feel eyes on me all the time.

06:39.125 --> 06:40.893
I just want to feel safe.

06:42.094 --> 06:44.397
I'm doing the best I can here.

06:44.430 --> 06:47.033
You're crazy, you know
that?

06:47.066 --> 06:48.467
I know.

06:48.501 --> 06:51.337
Relax, nobody's watching
you.

06:53.105 --> 06:54.907
How do you know that?

06:54.940 --> 06:57.609
You're just a
normal American woman.

06:58.878 --> 07:00.146
Who'd be watching you?

07:01.013 --> 07:02.014
I don't know.

07:03.682 --> 07:04.683
I don't know.

07:08.921 --> 07:10.723
I just feel so alone.

07:10.756 --> 07:15.161
So, go out, meet
people, have a drink, dance.

07:15.995 --> 07:17.696
You know I can't do that.

07:18.631 --> 07:22.234
Copy that, then I can't
help you.

07:27.640 --> 07:28.974
Shit.

07:38.984 --> 07:41.586
Breaker breaker. No, that's
CB's.

07:45.758 --> 07:48.227
Hello out there, anybody home?

07:56.035 --> 07:57.503
Very Dangerous.

07:59.472 --> 08:01.340
Hello, this is William.

08:01.373 --> 08:03.342
Who's out there? I'm picking you
up.

08:04.677 --> 08:08.814
This is K-2-W-M-O. Can you hear
me?

08:11.450 --> 08:15.387
Careful!
It's not what it seams.

08:17.823 --> 08:19.725
Hello, I'm not making that
out.

08:21.627 --> 08:22.962
Hello?

08:25.131 --> 08:26.799
Can you hear me?

08:41.113 --> 08:42.214
What are you reading?

08:43.916 --> 08:47.186
Protocols for using
that radio downstairs.

08:47.219 --> 08:48.888
You're gonna use that old
thing?

08:50.022 --> 08:51.857
Why not? Might be fun.

08:52.825 --> 08:54.894
Get me in touch with my dad,
maybe.

08:54.927 --> 08:57.496
Maybe you can connect
with him on the other side.

08:58.898 --> 08:59.865
I don't think I could afford

08:59.899 --> 09:02.001
that long distance bill, honey.

09:02.034 --> 09:03.335
Who'd want to talk to dead
people?

09:03.369 --> 09:05.771
I think it'd be cool, don't
you think?

09:07.406 --> 09:10.142
Well, it'd certainly be
interesting, that's for sure.

09:18.217 --> 09:19.552
Okay.

09:20.452 --> 09:22.922
Use QC as a general...

09:25.357 --> 09:26.458
Let's give this a try.

09:28.928 --> 09:32.765
Calling QC, is anybody on this
frequency?

09:35.501 --> 09:36.869
Calling QC.

09:38.904 --> 09:43.909
This is W-2-A-S-D
Whiskey two Alpha Sierra Delta.

09:44.076 --> 09:46.512
Who is this? What's your call
number?

09:46.545 --> 09:50.182
Me? It's K-2-W-M-O.

09:51.584 --> 09:54.153
Do you have a handle,
K-2-W-M-O?

09:57.723 --> 10:00.694
Traveling man? What's yours?

10:02.094 --> 10:03.128
Melder girl.

10:04.463 --> 10:06.498
It's nice to meet your Melder
girl.

10:06.532 --> 10:07.667
Whereabouts are you?

10:09.201 --> 10:11.470
Why do you want to know
that?

10:11.503 --> 10:13.739
No reason really, just
curious.

10:14.940 --> 10:16.208
I'm really, really new at this.

10:16.242 --> 10:18.777
So, I don't know how far
away you can reach people.

10:19.912 --> 10:22.615
You can reach people all over
the world.

10:22.649 --> 10:24.350
No shit.

10:24.383 --> 10:25.719
No shit.

10:28.254 --> 10:29.588
New York.

10:30.322 --> 10:31.658
I'm sorry, what?

10:32.692 --> 10:33.959
I live in New York.

10:34.793 --> 10:35.861
The city?

10:37.229 --> 10:40.432
No, small town in New York
state.

10:41.367 --> 10:42.434
Hey, me too.

10:42.468 --> 10:43.769
What are the odds, huh?

10:45.337 --> 10:47.172
Well, you know, it is a big
state,

10:47.206 --> 10:48.642
lot of people live here.

10:49.743 --> 10:51.310
So, what town do you live in?

10:52.778 --> 10:54.446
I'd prefer not to say.

10:55.547 --> 10:58.350
Okay. I mean, upstate,
downstate?

11:00.419 --> 11:01.887
Let's just say New York state

11:01.920 --> 11:03.489
and leave it at that, shall we?

11:04.490 --> 11:05.824
Okay.

11:07.593 --> 11:09.328
Do you like baseball?

11:09.361 --> 11:10.462
No.

11:10.496 --> 11:12.831
Okay. This is why I don't
date.

11:14.300 --> 11:16.201
I'm sorry, I didn't
catch that. Come again.

11:16.235 --> 11:19.138
I said, is anything
interesting going on

11:19.171 --> 11:21.974
around where you are, wherever
you happen to be living?

11:23.442 --> 11:27.112
Nothing interesting ever
happens to me around here.

11:27.146 --> 11:29.148
Same day, same song, as they
say.

11:30.182 --> 11:32.418
See, now I know exactly where
you are.

11:34.586 --> 11:36.555
What do you mean by that?

11:36.588 --> 11:39.325
You know what? You know where I
live?

11:39.358 --> 11:40.426
I was just kidding.

11:42.828 --> 11:44.163
Sorry.

11:44.530 --> 11:45.732
Don't worry, my daughters

11:45.765 --> 11:47.499
don't get my sense of humor
either.

11:49.268 --> 11:50.336
So, you're married?

11:51.470 --> 11:55.809
I was, she died a couple
of years ago, leukemia.

11:57.142 --> 11:58.377
Sorry to hear that.

11:59.878 --> 12:03.182
So am I, how about you, are
you married?

12:05.284 --> 12:06.618
No.

12:07.319 --> 12:08.420
Boyfriend?

12:10.622 --> 12:12.124
Not anymore.

12:12.659 --> 12:14.026
I'm sorry to hear that.

12:15.729 --> 12:17.596
Well, I guess.

12:17.630 --> 12:19.766
You know I'm like a lot
of other women these days.

12:19.799 --> 12:22.968
I mean, so many men have come
and gone.

12:24.236 --> 12:25.404
Tough love life, huh?

12:27.906 --> 12:30.376
I prefer not to talk about
this.

12:31.678 --> 12:33.713
I'm sorry, I wasn't meaning to
be nosy.

12:36.148 --> 12:37.483
It's jake.

12:38.584 --> 12:40.018
Did you just say it's jake?

12:41.387 --> 12:42.388
Yeah.

12:42.421 --> 12:45.324
God, I haven't heard
that expression in years.

12:45.357 --> 12:47.827
Well, jake, you know,
it means it's okay,

12:47.861 --> 12:49.895
everything's fine, like that.

12:49.928 --> 12:50.896
No, I know what it means,

12:50.929 --> 12:52.998
my grandfather used to
use it all the time.

12:54.533 --> 12:56.568
You actually sound familiar to
me.

12:56.602 --> 12:58.070
I wonder if we've met before.

12:59.639 --> 13:00.807
I doubt that.

13:04.811 --> 13:07.012
I'm gonna have to sign
off now, Traveling man,

13:07.045 --> 13:08.715
the boys here with the
groceries.

13:10.850 --> 13:14.253
Copy that, hopefully
we'll find each other again.

13:17.690 --> 13:19.692
That is so cool.

13:21.593 --> 13:23.962
Grocery delivery, she lives in
the city.

13:29.769 --> 13:30.737
Who is it?

13:30.770 --> 13:32.271
It's Billy.

13:34.940 --> 13:36.375
Over there as usual please.

13:39.679 --> 13:41.947
Mr. Krotter says he's all out
of sugar,

13:41.980 --> 13:44.283
but hopefully he'll get
some in by maybe next week.

13:45.317 --> 13:46.653
Oh well.

13:47.687 --> 13:50.122
I guess that means no cookies
for me.

13:50.155 --> 13:51.290
Cookies!?

13:51.323 --> 13:53.827
My ma hasn't baked anything
sweet in such a long time.

13:53.860 --> 13:55.260
Well, it's better for you.

13:57.129 --> 13:58.096
What is it?

13:58.130 --> 14:00.165
It's $2.40 today, ma'am.

14:06.773 --> 14:08.574
There we go.

14:08.607 --> 14:12.010
Thanks, miss Saints, see you
next week.

14:33.700 --> 14:35.635
God, I remember this.

15:17.242 --> 15:19.411
"Sir William and I were
playing catch this afternoon

15:19.444 --> 15:21.513
until it got too dark to see.

15:23.448 --> 15:25.018
Kids got a great arm."

15:27.286 --> 15:28.788
I had a great arm.

15:30.188 --> 15:31.256
Sir William.

15:32.157 --> 15:34.226
God, I forgot all about that.

15:37.229 --> 15:39.097
Point taken Dr. Jennings.

15:39.999 --> 15:41.901
Dad, you down there?

15:41.935 --> 15:43.468
Yeah.

15:43.502 --> 15:45.537
The spaghetti sauce is
burning.

15:46.639 --> 15:48.507
Did you turn the burner off?

15:48.540 --> 15:49.876
No.

15:50.342 --> 15:51.711
Well, Mindy...

16:01.788 --> 16:03.355
So, how was school today?

16:03.388 --> 16:04.958
Boring as always.

16:04.991 --> 16:06.391
That's because you don't have
friends.

16:06.425 --> 16:07.860
- I do too.
- Girls.

16:09.929 --> 16:11.965
I have a stupid history test
tomorrow,

16:11.998 --> 16:13.565
who cares about history?

16:15.267 --> 16:16.535
On what?

16:16.568 --> 16:17.904
World War II.

16:17.937 --> 16:20.539
So stupid, it's 1984,

16:20.572 --> 16:23.609
who cares about some dumb war
anyways?

16:23.643 --> 16:24.877
I don't think it was dumb for
the people

16:24.911 --> 16:27.080
that were living back then.

16:27.112 --> 16:28.580
Were you in the war, dad?

16:28.614 --> 16:30.783
No honey, I'm not that old.

16:30.817 --> 16:31.918
I mean, I was alive back then,

16:31.951 --> 16:34.286
but I was younger than the two
of you.

16:34.319 --> 16:35.855
Did he know anyone who died?

16:37.890 --> 16:41.894
My two uncles, my dad's
brothers, they were both killed.

16:44.262 --> 16:46.398
How come your father
didn't join the war?

16:49.234 --> 16:51.904
He had a problem with the
hearing in one of his ears.

16:51.938 --> 16:54.306
Bet he was glad to get out of
it.

16:54.339 --> 16:55.374
I don't think so.

16:55.407 --> 16:58.143
I think he was really
upset that he couldn't go.

16:58.176 --> 16:59.411
Why?

16:59.444 --> 17:00.713
Things were different back
then.

17:00.747 --> 17:04.182
A lot of people were very
patriotic during the war.

17:04.216 --> 17:06.551
It was America all the way.

17:06.585 --> 17:07.552
Bet they'd feel different

17:07.586 --> 17:09.689
if they had to read about it all
the time.

17:13.860 --> 17:16.095
I started going
through my father's stuff

17:16.129 --> 17:19.899
and one of the things
is his old ham radio.

17:19.932 --> 17:22.035
And I plugged it in and it still
works.

17:24.202 --> 17:25.537
But...

17:26.839 --> 17:28.841
But what?

17:28.875 --> 17:31.243
None of that stuff is
really stirring things up

17:31.276 --> 17:32.511
like I hoped it would.

17:33.345 --> 17:35.014
Like for instance, I came across

17:35.048 --> 17:36.348
this old checkered handkerchief

17:36.381 --> 17:37.817
that he used to carry around all
the time.

17:37.850 --> 17:39.518
And I remembered that he used to

17:39.551 --> 17:42.254
tie it around my face sometimes
like an outlaw's mask.

17:43.388 --> 17:45.323
So, I'm picking up a thing
or two here and there

17:45.357 --> 17:49.461
but I don't remember, remember.

17:49.494 --> 17:53.265
You know, that darkness is still
there.

17:54.266 --> 17:57.870
You know, the mind is a
complicated, tricky thing.

17:57.904 --> 18:01.007
That's why it's so important
that we try different things

18:01.040 --> 18:03.408
because we never know
what's going to stick.

18:03.442 --> 18:06.079
And I know you think I'm
pitching hypnosis here,

18:06.112 --> 18:08.246
but I'm not, all right.

18:08.280 --> 18:10.983
I actually think it's pretty
important

18:11.017 --> 18:12.785
that you go through
your father's belongings

18:12.819 --> 18:15.253
on a number of levels.

18:15.287 --> 18:17.790
It actually might bring
you out of this darkness.

18:19.092 --> 18:20.525
It's just so irritating.

18:21.493 --> 18:24.864
I know something happened,
but I can't just assume

18:24.897 --> 18:26.498
that it has anything to
do with my father's death.

18:26.531 --> 18:28.467
That could be a complete
coincidence.

18:29.635 --> 18:33.806
If you believe in
coincidences, which I don't.

18:41.914 --> 18:43.448
"Well, I was at the hardware
store,

18:43.482 --> 18:46.284
a woman came in, never saw her
before.

18:46.318 --> 18:48.654
Told Chubby she had just moved
to town.

18:49.822 --> 18:51.190
I tried to introduce myself

18:51.224 --> 18:52.892
but she gave me the greasy eye.

18:52.925 --> 18:56.361
Not my type, still there
was something about her.

18:56.394 --> 18:57.462
Looked like the sort of dame

18:57.496 --> 18:59.699
that might enjoy a good tumble."

19:02.769 --> 19:04.771
The things you don't want
to know about your dad.

19:08.440 --> 19:09.508
William!

19:13.411 --> 19:14.747
William!

19:21.620 --> 19:23.923
Hello, who's out there?

19:28.326 --> 19:29.561
Hello?

19:32.064 --> 19:33.633
Hello?

20:05.832 --> 20:10.236
This is W-2-A-S-D
Whiskey two Alpha Sierra Delta.

20:11.170 --> 20:13.505
Traveling man, are you on the
air?

20:14.406 --> 20:16.108
Traveling man?

20:16.142 --> 20:18.978
This is Traveling man, Melder
girl?

20:19.011 --> 20:20.345
Copy.

20:22.514 --> 20:23.716
Didn't have much to do today,

20:23.749 --> 20:26.118
so, I thought I'd reach out.

20:26.152 --> 20:27.619
I'm here.

20:27.653 --> 20:29.088
Can I ask you a question?

20:29.922 --> 20:31.157
Shoot.

20:31.190 --> 20:32.859
I'm sorry, come again.

20:32.892 --> 20:35.560
Yeah, go ahead and ask your
question.

20:35.594 --> 20:39.232
So, why Traveling man? Are
you a salesman or something?

20:40.233 --> 20:42.168
No, I'm a post-harvest
consultant

20:42.201 --> 20:44.569
and it takes me overseas a lot.

20:44.603 --> 20:46.806
What's post-harvest?

20:46.839 --> 20:49.242
It's an agriculture term.

20:49.275 --> 20:52.377
Basically, I show people
how to store their crops

20:52.410 --> 20:55.114
after they harvest them so that
they get

20:55.147 --> 20:58.184
as much longevity out of them
as possible before they spoil.

20:59.218 --> 21:01.586
Sounds like it's very
important.

21:01.620 --> 21:03.055
In some regions of the world

21:03.089 --> 21:05.992
It's the difference between
living and starving to death.

21:06.025 --> 21:07.326
It's very important.

21:08.227 --> 21:10.630
You sound very passionate
about it.

21:10.663 --> 21:12.298
Well, I grew up on a farm

21:12.331 --> 21:14.066
and I used to work in a grocery
store.

21:14.100 --> 21:17.602
So, I guess you could say foods
been a big part of my life.

21:18.570 --> 21:21.007
So, you still have the farm?

21:21.040 --> 21:23.643
No, my mom sold that a long
time ago,

21:23.676 --> 21:25.044
after I left school and decided

21:25.077 --> 21:26.646
I wanted to become a professor.

21:28.114 --> 21:31.651
Professor, huh? Very
impressive.

21:31.684 --> 21:33.920
Oh, it is very, very
impressive.

21:33.953 --> 21:37.123
Especially if you love
red tape and ass kissing,

21:37.156 --> 21:38.391
which I don't like either one.

21:38.423 --> 21:42.328
So, that's why I left teaching
and went into consulting.

21:42.361 --> 21:44.297
I think it makes more of an
impact anyway.

21:44.330 --> 21:46.832
And you know, I get to
do a lot of traveling.

21:48.100 --> 21:50.836
Hence the handle Traveling
man. Okay, I got it.

21:51.904 --> 21:54.874
So, what about you? What
do you do for a living?

21:54.907 --> 21:57.442
Nothing anymore, I inherited
some money.

21:58.610 --> 22:00.279
Life of leisure,
huh?

22:01.881 --> 22:02.915
Not really.

22:03.849 --> 22:05.251
Do you travel at all?

22:06.118 --> 22:08.654
Used to, not much
anymore.

22:09.822 --> 22:11.357
Have you ever been to Europe?

22:14.293 --> 22:16.461
Why do you want to know that?

22:17.930 --> 22:19.932
No reason, just curious.

22:23.402 --> 22:25.004
Yes, I've been to Europe.

22:26.072 --> 22:28.741
I just got back, I was
there a couple of weeks ago.

22:29.775 --> 22:32.745
I think it'd break
my heart to see it now.

22:32.778 --> 22:34.180
I thought it was amazing.

22:34.213 --> 22:36.182
I mean, just absolutely
beautiful.

22:36.215 --> 22:39.051
Especially if you're
into the history of it.

22:39.085 --> 22:40.386
Where did you go?

22:41.320 --> 22:42.554
I was in London for a few days

22:42.587 --> 22:45.057
and then went on to France and
Germany.

22:48.294 --> 22:50.396
What do they look like now?

22:50.429 --> 22:52.965
What do they look like? I
don't know.

22:52.999 --> 22:55.533
Like America, I guess, except
different.

22:55.567 --> 22:57.370
I wasn't there working-working,

22:57.403 --> 22:59.638
those countries don't need my
expertise.

22:59.672 --> 23:03.409
We were actually there for a
conference concerning Zimbabwe.

23:03.442 --> 23:05.543
Dad, you down there?

23:05.577 --> 23:07.680
I gotta be a Danny's in 10
minutes.

23:08.881 --> 23:10.349
All right, I'll be right up.

23:12.485 --> 23:14.286
Melder girl, my kids are calling
me

23:14.320 --> 23:16.655
so, I've got to go, you
have a great afternoon.

23:22.094 --> 23:23.429
Like America.

23:25.597 --> 23:26.932
I doubt that.

25:16.442 --> 25:19.545
I thought you guys
didn't like it down here.

25:37.062 --> 25:39.633
So, why
aren't you sleeping well?

25:39.665 --> 25:42.768
I just had the dream about
my father still being alive.

25:42.801 --> 25:44.203
That's reoccurring?

25:44.236 --> 25:45.538
It's actually expanding.

25:46.405 --> 25:49.408
Not married, don't have kids.

25:49.441 --> 25:53.279
It's just the two of us
working my family's old farm.

25:53.312 --> 25:54.780
Interesting.

25:54.813 --> 25:57.850
And it's not disjointed like
dreams usually are though.

25:57.883 --> 26:00.619
It's very common, very
day-to-day feel.

26:00.654 --> 26:02.021
In some ways it's reminiscent

26:02.054 --> 26:04.323
of that darkness we've been
talking about

26:04.356 --> 26:08.727
in the sense that I feel it
more than I actually see it,

26:09.862 --> 26:12.031
but it's still very real.

26:12.064 --> 26:15.301
But it isn't, and it certainly
shouldn't be keeping you

26:15.334 --> 26:17.069
from a full night's rest.

26:17.102 --> 26:18.737
Dreams are a way for our minds

26:18.771 --> 26:21.273
to work out our problems
and our anxieties.

26:21.307 --> 26:23.475
They shouldn't be adding to
them.

26:23.509 --> 26:25.377
Let me know if this keeps up

26:25.411 --> 26:27.880
and I'll prescribe something for
you.

26:27.913 --> 26:29.248
Okay.

26:44.830 --> 26:46.765
Are you on the airway Melder
girl?

26:50.302 --> 26:52.104
Melder girl, are you there?

26:55.574 --> 26:56.643
Melder girl?

26:59.745 --> 27:00.813
Melder girl?

27:07.019 --> 27:09.656
This is Melder girl,
Is this Traveling man?

27:10.789 --> 27:12.858
Hey, I didn't know
if I'd catch you today.

27:12.891 --> 27:16.996
You caught me, what you doing?

27:17.029 --> 27:19.265
Not a whole lot, just
did some running around.

27:19.298 --> 27:22.368
Got some time to kill before
I have to put dinner on.

27:22.401 --> 27:24.704
What is that noise that I keep
hearing?

27:26.038 --> 27:27.373
What noise?

27:27.873 --> 27:32.144
It's like jingling or
metal or something like that.

27:32.177 --> 27:35.047
Oh, it's 50 cent pieces.

27:35.080 --> 27:37.983
I carry a lot of change around
with me, it's an old habit

27:38.017 --> 27:39.653
and sometimes I wind up playing
with them

27:39.686 --> 27:41.553
and don't even realize I'm doing
it.

27:42.554 --> 27:44.056
Does it annoy you?

27:45.024 --> 27:46.025
Yes.

27:47.026 --> 27:48.360
Sorry.

27:50.329 --> 27:51.698
So, anything new with you?

27:52.632 --> 27:54.800
Nothing ever changes where I
am.

27:55.934 --> 27:58.971
Oh, come on.
Things change all the time.

27:59.004 --> 28:02.141
Not to me they don't,
I don't leave my house.

28:03.108 --> 28:04.610
Never?

28:04.644 --> 28:06.178
Never.

28:06.211 --> 28:07.846
Why's that?

28:07.880 --> 28:11.751
I have a condition,
it's extreme nervousness.

28:11.785 --> 28:15.921
Every time I go outside,
my heart starts to race.

28:15.954 --> 28:20.025
I break into a sweat, I just
feel like I'm gonna die.

28:21.226 --> 28:23.095
Well, that sounds like
agoraphobia.

28:24.129 --> 28:25.464
What's that?

28:25.931 --> 28:28.768
You've never
heard of agoraphobia before?

28:28.802 --> 28:30.369
No.

28:30.402 --> 28:32.739
It's a psychological disorder.

28:32.772 --> 28:36.542
Well, my doctor said it
was extreme nervousness.

28:36.575 --> 28:39.178
Well, what did your doctor
prescribe?

28:39.211 --> 28:40.446
Rest.

28:40.479 --> 28:42.214
Rest, is that it?

28:42.247 --> 28:44.083
There's medications that could
help you

28:44.116 --> 28:45.317
with this Melder girl.

28:46.352 --> 28:47.853
Well, that wasn't mentioned.

28:48.722 --> 28:50.657
I'd get a second opinion.

28:50.690 --> 28:52.391
A shrink could certainly help
you.

28:53.225 --> 28:54.593
Did you say shrink?

28:55.461 --> 28:56.796
Yeah.

28:58.864 --> 29:00.232
I don't understand.

29:00.265 --> 29:02.836
Like what, I'm supposed to be
smaller?

29:02.868 --> 29:04.203
Smaller? No.

29:05.170 --> 29:06.605
Seeing a psychiatrist doesn't
make you

29:06.639 --> 29:08.474
any less of a person, Melder
girl.

29:09.642 --> 29:13.245
What does a psychiatrist
have to do with this?

29:13.278 --> 29:15.481
That's what we're talking
about, a psychiatrist.

29:15.514 --> 29:16.716
You should see one to help you

29:16.750 --> 29:19.184
with being scared to leave your
house.

29:19.218 --> 29:20.854
Well thank you, no.

29:20.886 --> 29:23.889
But I don't think I would
enjoy electroshock very much.

29:25.190 --> 29:27.493
Electroshock? They
don't do that anymore.

29:28.360 --> 29:31.163
Lots of people see
psychiatrists, Melder girl.

29:31.196 --> 29:32.832
I'm even seeing one right now.

29:34.032 --> 29:35.601
Why? What's wrong with you?

29:38.671 --> 29:41.039
I had a traumatic
experience when I was young.

29:42.074 --> 29:44.042
What happened?

29:44.076 --> 29:46.011
I don't remember.

29:46.044 --> 29:47.814
Well then how do you
know it was traumatic

29:47.847 --> 29:49.883
If you can't remember?

29:49.915 --> 29:52.584
That is a fantastic question.

29:53.653 --> 29:56.622
And I'm currently spending $40
an hour trying to answer it.

29:58.223 --> 30:00.492
$40 An hour?

30:01.593 --> 30:03.996
I think I know what's causing
your trauma.

30:12.237 --> 30:16.475
H-8-A-9-Q-R-L. Are you there?

30:18.010 --> 30:20.012
How are you, Eva?

30:20.045 --> 30:23.482
Han, where have you been?
I've been trying to contact you.

30:24.349 --> 30:25.852
Been hot here.

30:25.885 --> 30:28.287
Are you still in Panama?

30:28.320 --> 30:30.522
Affirmative. Be moving
soon.

30:31.590 --> 30:33.091
Why?

30:33.125 --> 30:34.727
Got some people to meet.

30:35.862 --> 30:37.831
I wish I could come.

30:37.864 --> 30:39.866
I've always wanted to see South
America.

30:40.834 --> 30:42.234
You're better there.

30:43.736 --> 30:44.737
I suppose so.

30:46.238 --> 30:48.641
This nervousness is really
getting to me.

30:49.876 --> 30:51.043
Relax, Eva.

30:52.311 --> 30:53.880
How's your project going there?

30:55.380 --> 30:57.784
It's been very successful.

30:57.817 --> 30:59.151
Good.

31:01.186 --> 31:05.457
Han, do you think we'll ever
meet?

31:07.092 --> 31:10.362
No. Signing off.

31:47.901 --> 31:50.870
K-2-W-M-O.

31:53.505 --> 31:55.975
K-2-W-M-O, Traveling man.

31:56.843 --> 31:58.510
Are you on the air?

32:01.681 --> 32:04.616
This is traveling man, Melder
girl?

32:04.651 --> 32:05.985
Yeah.

32:06.518 --> 32:07.820
How are you doing today?

32:08.955 --> 32:10.556
Actually, I'm tired.

32:11.691 --> 32:12.725
Late night, huh?

32:14.192 --> 32:16.595
No, I'm bored.

32:16.629 --> 32:19.164
It's exhausting to have
nothing to do all day.

32:20.033 --> 32:22.869
Saps your brain cells and your
body.

32:22.902 --> 32:24.069
Well, what do you do all day

32:24.102 --> 32:26.572
if you don't ever leave your
house?

32:26.605 --> 32:31.610
I don't know, I cook, I
read books and magazines,

32:31.711 --> 32:34.279
I do puzzles, listen to the
radio.

32:35.514 --> 32:37.684
That sounds lonely.

32:37.717 --> 32:39.052
Do you at least have cable?

32:40.920 --> 32:43.957
Cable? What, like overseas
cables?

32:43.990 --> 32:46.358
No, like TV cable.

32:47.225 --> 32:48.895
What is that?

32:49.729 --> 32:52.230
You really have been
secluded, haven't you?

32:52.264 --> 32:53.766
I mean, how long have
you had this condition,

32:53.800 --> 32:55.434
this nervousness of yours?

32:59.038 --> 33:01.540
I don't know, I guess it's
been bad

33:01.573 --> 33:02.875
for the last couple of months,

33:02.909 --> 33:05.611
but really started about a year
ago

33:05.645 --> 33:07.179
when I came back to America.

33:08.881 --> 33:10.315
Where were you before that?

33:11.183 --> 33:14.921
I was living overseas,
circumstances changed.

33:14.954 --> 33:18.024
My mother died, probably from
shame

33:18.057 --> 33:20.693
that her daughter didn't
live up to her expectations.

33:21.560 --> 33:25.263
But anyway, came back and now
I'm living in their house.

33:26.633 --> 33:29.669
Her hous? So, your dad's past
as well?

33:29.702 --> 33:32.739
Yeah, it's probably the right
thing

33:32.772 --> 33:34.473
to come back to America.

33:35.507 --> 33:39.912
But it was scary.

33:39.946 --> 33:42.882
I mean, I felt like
everybody was watching me

33:43.750 --> 33:47.619
and judging me because I'd
been living in Germany.

33:47.654 --> 33:51.590
And I just felt hostility
everywhere from everybody.

33:52.725 --> 33:54.593
No, I doubt that was the case.

33:54.626 --> 33:56.863
That's probably a lot
of that's in your head.

33:56.896 --> 34:00.733
Maybe, but after a while I
just went out less and less.

34:02.200 --> 34:05.738
I mean, when I went out, I
just felt like I was gonna...

34:05.772 --> 34:07.106
I was having a heart attack

34:08.041 --> 34:12.277
and I would just feel enveloped
by panic, it was awful.

34:12.310 --> 34:13.612
God, that's terrible.

34:14.781 --> 34:16.015
Yeah it was.

34:17.516 --> 34:18.517
Is.

34:19.584 --> 34:21.754
So, you lived in Germany?

34:21.788 --> 34:23.122
Yes.

34:23.690 --> 34:25.323
For how long?

34:25.357 --> 34:27.026
Couple of years.

34:27.060 --> 34:29.062
Like I told
you, I just got back.

34:29.095 --> 34:32.197
Did you get to see any of the
sites while you lived there?

34:32.230 --> 34:33.766
Sites?

34:33.800 --> 34:35.600
Yeah, well, I mean, we were in
Munich,

34:35.635 --> 34:38.171
but I'm not really into cities

34:38.203 --> 34:40.873
so this professor friend and I,

34:40.907 --> 34:45.812
we went around and we did the
castles, the famous castles.

34:45.845 --> 34:47.512
And there was one in particular,

34:53.452 --> 34:56.089
I'm sure I'm butchering that,
but...

34:56.122 --> 34:57.857
It's Neuschwanstein.

34:57.890 --> 34:59.125
That's it.

34:59.158 --> 35:02.662
That place was amazing, I mean
right out of sleeping beauty.

35:02.695 --> 35:05.164
You know, just real fairytale
stuff.

35:06.032 --> 35:08.400
Oh, I know. I see it every
morning.

35:09.468 --> 35:10.636
How's that?

35:11.938 --> 35:14.006
I have a picture of it on my
wall.

35:17.143 --> 35:20.947
Well, I'm gonna sign off now, I
think.

35:20.980 --> 35:23.248
I'm really in desperate
need of a cup of Joe.

35:24.316 --> 35:25.718
Yeah, talk later.

35:34.060 --> 35:36.028
William.

35:59.852 --> 36:03.022
This is K-2-W-M-O,
who's out there? Over.

36:06.092 --> 36:07.760
Who is this? Over.

36:10.696 --> 36:12.497
Melder girl, was that you?

36:16.301 --> 36:17.837
Melder girl, are you there?

36:25.178 --> 36:26.344
This is weird.

36:43.996 --> 36:45.832
What kind of
voices?

36:46.866 --> 36:51.871
It's hard to describe, but
it's like echoey, incoherent.

36:52.337 --> 36:55.473
Voices coming out of a radio,
who would've thought that?

36:55.507 --> 36:56.909
You don't have to be an ass
about it.

36:56.943 --> 36:58.376
I know how it sounds.

36:58.410 --> 37:01.513
It's just not the kind of,
what you would expect to hear

37:01.546 --> 37:02.982
coming out of a radio.

37:03.015 --> 37:04.784
Couldn't it just be people
talking

37:04.817 --> 37:06.585
and you're hearing bits and
pieces,

37:06.618 --> 37:07.920
fragments of their
conversations?

37:07.954 --> 37:10.089
It's more familiar than that.

37:10.122 --> 37:12.859
I mean, I've literally heard
my name more than once.

37:12.892 --> 37:14.526
Your actual name?

37:14.559 --> 37:17.964
Well, you know, that's
actually an auditory memory.

37:17.997 --> 37:19.732
Especially if it's happening

37:19.765 --> 37:21.533
when you're in a hypnagogic
state.

37:22.400 --> 37:23.368
Hypnagogic.

37:23.401 --> 37:25.238
Yeah, well that's that time,

37:25.271 --> 37:27.640
you know, between waking
reality and sleep.

37:29.275 --> 37:30.542
But I'm not in bed.

37:30.575 --> 37:32.979
I'm not nodding off or
anything, I'm perfectly awake.

37:33.012 --> 37:35.047
Yeah, well, you know,
a hypnagogic state,

37:35.081 --> 37:36.949
it's very common and it doesn't
have to be

37:36.983 --> 37:38.450
at that time specifically.

37:38.483 --> 37:41.187
They've actually done studies on
it.

37:41.220 --> 37:42.188
You know, some people think

37:42.221 --> 37:44.023
there's a metaphysical component
to that,

37:44.056 --> 37:46.225
but I don't buy into that.

37:46.259 --> 37:49.328
Just like you don't
buy into coincidences.

37:49.362 --> 37:52.031
You know, the mind's already
shrouded in enough mystery

37:52.064 --> 37:55.134
without taking on anything
paranormal or supernatural.

37:56.102 --> 37:58.403
I bet you're a lot of fun at
story time

37:58.436 --> 38:00.106
around the campfire.

38:38.077 --> 38:39.611
What's that?

38:39.645 --> 38:41.213
Some of your mom's things.

38:42.081 --> 38:43.783
I thought we could go through
them.

38:46.252 --> 38:47.353
I thought you said-

38:47.386 --> 38:48.453
- I know what I said,

38:48.486 --> 38:52.590
and I think it was wrong
and I'm sorry about that.

38:53.759 --> 38:55.094
Come on, let's take a look.

38:59.799 --> 39:01.634
Doesn't it make you sad?

39:01.667 --> 39:04.670
Yeah, it does, a little,
but it's important.

39:04.704 --> 39:06.038
Why?

39:06.973 --> 39:08.908
Because family's important.

39:08.941 --> 39:11.944
I mean I lost my dad
when I was about your age

39:11.978 --> 39:13.913
and I didn't have a
sense of him as a person

39:13.946 --> 39:16.282
because Nana didn't like to
talk about him after he died.

39:16.315 --> 39:17.917
Why not?

39:17.950 --> 39:18.918
I don't know, honey.

39:18.951 --> 39:20.186
I'm sure she had a reason.

39:20.219 --> 39:22.487
But not talking about
him was very hard for me.

39:22.520 --> 39:24.957
And I don't want the same
thing for the two of you.

39:24.991 --> 39:27.860
I don't want you to ever
lose the image of your mom.

39:27.893 --> 39:29.527
I want you to always remember
her

39:29.561 --> 39:32.431
and always be able to
keep that memory close.

39:32.465 --> 39:34.200
I mean none of this is
really that valuable,

39:34.233 --> 39:35.735
but she'd want you to have it.

39:36.635 --> 39:37.770
Are those pictures?

39:37.803 --> 39:41.207
Mm-hmm.

39:41.240 --> 39:43.676
And they're from when she was
younger.

39:45.444 --> 39:46.445
You look like her.

39:47.913 --> 39:50.016
You look just like her in this
one.

39:50.049 --> 39:51.784
You actually both have her
looks.

39:52.752 --> 39:54.519
You also have some of her
mannerisms.

39:54.552 --> 39:56.722
The way you say certain things.

39:58.357 --> 40:00.092
I see her in both of you every
day.

40:01.293 --> 40:02.527
Can I keep this one?

40:02.560 --> 40:04.529
You can keep all of it.

40:04.562 --> 40:07.366
Everything in this box
belongs to both of you now.

40:34.827 --> 40:37.696
Melder girl, this is Traveling
man.

40:40.833 --> 40:44.804
Melder girl?

40:44.837 --> 40:46.338
Melder girl?

40:47.273 --> 40:50.943
I'm here. I also think
I'm a little drunk.

40:52.311 --> 40:54.280
I don't think I'm too far
behind you.

40:56.182 --> 40:57.817
So, you drinking because you're
happy

40:57.850 --> 40:59.785
or drowning your problems?

41:01.520 --> 41:03.022
The last one.

41:03.522 --> 41:05.157
I've been there.

41:05.191 --> 41:07.259
I'll tell you, the devil's hard
to drown.

41:08.160 --> 41:11.130
I know I've been spending
a lot of my days trying.

41:12.264 --> 41:14.599
You know, the problem with
being alone

41:14.633 --> 41:17.203
is you just have all these
thoughts

41:17.236 --> 41:20.306
and you just, you don't have
anybody to work them out with.

41:21.407 --> 41:24.210
So, they just sit there and go
round and round in your head

41:24.243 --> 41:27.413
like some kind of crazy Ferris
wheel.

41:29.415 --> 41:31.750
Well, I'm here right
now. You can talk to me.

41:34.019 --> 41:35.121
I don't know you.

41:36.621 --> 41:38.157
That's what makes it perfect.

41:38.190 --> 41:41.093
I mean, who better than a
stranger to tell your problems to?

41:42.461 --> 41:43.462
Maybe.

41:44.964 --> 41:46.665
So, what's
troubling you this evening,

41:46.699 --> 41:48.200
Melder girl?

41:50.903 --> 41:52.238
The past.

41:53.572 --> 41:55.241
Just doesn't want to let go of
me.

41:56.742 --> 41:59.912
I guess a lot of people
could say something like that.

41:59.945 --> 42:03.549
I know my past's been
haunting me for years.

42:03.582 --> 42:05.784
Why? What happened to
you?

42:05.818 --> 42:07.253
I told you, I don't know.

42:08.354 --> 42:11.657
How can something you
don't know haunt you?

42:12.625 --> 42:16.262
'Cause I feel it, even
if I can't remember it.

42:16.295 --> 42:18.831
Then how do you know it's bad?

42:18.864 --> 42:21.600
That's what my shrink and
I are trying to figure out.

42:22.835 --> 42:24.170
Your what?

42:24.803 --> 42:27.706
I told you I'm
seeing this psychiatrist.

42:29.141 --> 42:31.277
Oh yeah, yeah, that's right. I
remember.

42:32.511 --> 42:34.113
I don't know, Traveling man.

42:35.481 --> 42:38.017
I think I'd like to trade with
you.

42:38.050 --> 42:39.852
I'd like to forget my past.

42:41.287 --> 42:42.454
I don't recommend it.

42:43.722 --> 42:45.958
So, what are you trying to
forget?

42:45.991 --> 42:47.326
Broken heart?

42:49.295 --> 42:50.796
It's part of it.

42:51.730 --> 42:53.465
Probably not like you think
though.

42:56.368 --> 42:59.171
Can I ask
you a personal question?

42:59.205 --> 43:00.773
Depends. What is it?

43:02.208 --> 43:04.644
What's your name? Like your
real name?

43:06.612 --> 43:08.747
Why do you want to know
that?

43:08.781 --> 43:11.750
'Cause Melder girl's
starting to sound like,

43:11.784 --> 43:14.253
"Hey you" or "To whom it may
concern".

43:16.922 --> 43:19.992
It's Eva. What's yours?

43:21.260 --> 43:22.328
My name's William.

43:24.096 --> 43:25.564
Some people call me Will.

43:27.667 --> 43:29.034
Most of them are gone now.

43:30.569 --> 43:33.172
You sound a little
bit drunk yourself, Will.

43:35.241 --> 43:37.509
Either that or very sad.

43:40.946 --> 43:41.947
The last one.

45:01.860 --> 45:03.329
I was actually pretty close

45:03.362 --> 45:05.097
to my mother growing up, you
know?

45:07.032 --> 45:09.335
But all that ended when I lived
abroad.

45:11.537 --> 45:14.373
She didn't approve of my
attachments.

45:16.241 --> 45:18.310
She just stopped talking to me,
you know.

45:19.178 --> 45:22.114
She wouldn't answer my
letters or my telegrams.

45:24.583 --> 45:26.786
My mom and I were always
close.

45:27.654 --> 45:31.056
Of course, my dad died when
I was a kid, so it made sense

45:31.090 --> 45:34.360
that we were sort of
clinging to each other.

45:36.362 --> 45:38.964
I am sorry to hear about your
mom though.

45:38.997 --> 45:41.100
Yeah, me too.

45:41.133 --> 45:43.435
But I don't regret my decisions.

45:45.537 --> 45:48.374
So, I want to ask you
another personal question.

45:48.407 --> 45:52.645
It'll help me put a better
mental picture of you in my mind.

45:53.747 --> 45:56.215
It's jake, go ahead.

45:58.951 --> 46:00.052
How old are you?

46:03.857 --> 46:05.524
That is personal.

46:06.693 --> 46:09.094
I know better, but I'm drunk,
so...

46:12.398 --> 46:14.099
Let's just say I'm old enough.

46:16.068 --> 46:18.170
That is a fantastic age.

46:20.874 --> 46:21.875
God.

46:23.342 --> 46:25.277
We've been doing this all night.

46:26.211 --> 46:29.682
I know, it's been Saturday
for a couple of hours now.

46:30.983 --> 46:32.117
You must be tired.

46:34.854 --> 46:36.355
I am.

46:40.359 --> 46:41.360
Who is it?

46:42.561 --> 46:44.296
It's Billy.

46:45.264 --> 46:47.032
Will, I gotta go now,

46:47.065 --> 46:50.035
the kids here with the
groceries, I'm gonna sign off.

46:51.570 --> 46:54.206
Okay, talk to you later.

47:07.186 --> 47:08.822
Put it over there.

47:11.691 --> 47:14.092
It's $2.10 today, ma'am.

47:16.028 --> 47:17.362
Here.

47:18.530 --> 47:19.732
What's wrong?

47:19.766 --> 47:22.234
I forgot to bring
change.

47:22.267 --> 47:25.404
How can you deliver
groceries without change?

47:25.437 --> 47:27.573
You should always have change on
you.

47:29.107 --> 47:32.277
Tell Mr. Krotter that he can
have his ten cents next time.

47:32.311 --> 47:34.914
when his delivery boy does his
job right.

47:34.948 --> 47:37.349
But he'll take it out of my
wages.

47:37.382 --> 47:39.886
Price of an education, now
beat it.

48:03.041 --> 48:04.376
God.

48:06.578 --> 48:08.413
Don't
get caught up, William.

48:10.717 --> 48:12.652
It's not what it seems.

48:13.786 --> 48:16.956
Live on the wrong side of the
world.

48:16.990 --> 48:19.591
Hello? Who is this?

48:20.994 --> 48:23.095
I think you're bleeding into my
frequency.

48:24.029 --> 48:25.264
What's your call number?

48:27.366 --> 48:29.401
I found it.

48:39.611 --> 48:41.648
Auditory memory my ass.

48:47.452 --> 48:51.156
So, shouldn't I be laying
on a couch or something?

48:51.189 --> 48:53.625
Would that make you more
comfortable?

48:53.660 --> 48:55.127
No.

48:55.160 --> 48:56.930
Okay then.

48:56.963 --> 49:00.499
All right, so how do we do
this?

49:00.532 --> 49:03.736
Well, I'm just gonna talk
you into a state of relaxation

49:03.770 --> 49:05.137
and we'll go from there.

49:06.271 --> 49:09.042
All right, I want you to close
your eyes.

49:09.074 --> 49:13.545
All right, and I want you to
take some slow deep breaths.

49:15.480 --> 49:20.252
Now, can you think of a place
that's peaceful and safe?

49:21.219 --> 49:25.390
You're at that place and
your whole body feels light.

49:27.827 --> 49:28.928
You're at peace.

49:29.796 --> 49:34.801
There's no pain, no sorrow, just
peace.

49:35.668 --> 49:39.171
Now, keeping that safety and
that peace.

49:39.204 --> 49:41.139
I want you to go back in time,

49:42.274 --> 49:44.844
back to the day your memory was
lost.

49:45.745 --> 49:49.414
Start early in that day.
What were you doing?

49:50.717 --> 49:52.250
Helping dad with the tractor.

49:54.921 --> 49:58.457
Is everything okay
between the two of you?

49:58.490 --> 50:01.593
Yes, but he seems upset about
something.

50:02.729 --> 50:05.397
He tries to hide the fact that
he's upset.

50:05.430 --> 50:08.067
Did he say anything out of the
ordinary?

50:08.101 --> 50:10.335
No, but I can tell.

50:11.436 --> 50:12.537
What do you do next?

50:13.640 --> 50:15.574
I'm going to my job at the
store.

50:17.342 --> 50:18.845
Then what?

50:26.886 --> 50:28.721
I don't want to.

50:28.755 --> 50:29.989
It's okay.

50:30.023 --> 50:31.223
I don't know.

50:33.926 --> 50:35.028
I don't know.

50:38.397 --> 50:42.068
It's okay, just take a deep
breath.

50:42.101 --> 50:44.503
Why don't you just go back
to your safe place now.

50:55.380 --> 50:56.883
It's okay.

50:57.282 --> 50:58.617
One more thing I suck at.

51:00.687 --> 51:01.721
We'll get
there.

51:11.563 --> 51:16.135
So, last time we talked
you were a little down.

51:17.369 --> 51:18.537
I was drunk.

51:19.571 --> 51:21.373
Are you feeling
better?

51:21.406 --> 51:25.878
Yeah, you know, it's
actually really nice

51:25.912 --> 51:28.648
to have somebody to talk to for
a change.

51:28.681 --> 51:30.883
God, you say that like
I'm your only option,

51:30.917 --> 51:34.252
which for your sake I
hope is not the case.

51:34.286 --> 51:37.255
Am I becoming a burden to you,
Will?

51:37.289 --> 51:38.590
Just the opposite.

51:38.623 --> 51:41.728
I'm sure I'm only moderately
jake at best.

51:42.561 --> 51:44.964
No, you're fine company.

51:44.997 --> 51:46.866
Seriously though, I mean,
you don't have anybody else

51:46.899 --> 51:50.402
you can talk to like friends,
neighbor?

51:50.435 --> 51:52.138
Something more than just my
stupid voice

51:52.171 --> 51:53.673
coming out of a little box.

51:55.675 --> 51:59.011
I do have a friend of sorts.

52:00.312 --> 52:01.613
What's she like?

52:02.849 --> 52:04.183
It's a he.

52:06.152 --> 52:07.552
Oh.

52:07.586 --> 52:09.621
And we don't do a lot of
talking.

52:10.723 --> 52:11.824
None of my business.

52:12.859 --> 52:15.460
You don't have to snap your
cap, Will.

52:15.494 --> 52:18.998
I mean it's not serious
or anything, he's married.

52:21.868 --> 52:24.603
That's right, I'm one of those
women.

52:27.372 --> 52:29.608
Will, are you still there?

52:29.642 --> 52:34.080
I mean look, I'm not some
crazy man-eater or something.

52:34.113 --> 52:36.783
It's just, you know, one of
those things.

52:39.584 --> 52:41.319
It's not my place to judge.

52:42.922 --> 52:45.658
No, it's not, but you asked.

52:46.893 --> 52:49.494
Yeah, sometimes
I'm not very smart.

52:50.797 --> 52:51.964
Most men aren't.

52:55.367 --> 52:56.468
Are we still friends?

52:59.806 --> 53:01.274
Yes, we're still friends.

53:02.809 --> 53:06.212
I'm glad. I'm gonna sign off
now.

53:11.184 --> 53:12.885
It's not your
time.

53:56.229 --> 54:01.200
This is W-2-A-S-D, Whiskey
two Alpha Sierra Delta.

54:03.035 --> 54:05.671
This is H-8-A-9-Q-R-L,

54:05.705 --> 54:09.374
Hotel eight Alpha nine Quebec
Romeo Lima.

54:10.843 --> 54:13.578
I'm close to having
everything all together.

54:13.612 --> 54:15.114
How do you want me to send it?

54:16.148 --> 54:18.718
Just use the normal
signal when it's ready.

54:18.751 --> 54:21.988
I'll send someone within a
few days after to pick it up.

54:40.039 --> 54:41.307
So, what's all this?

54:41.340 --> 54:43.142
We're making picture boards.

54:43.175 --> 54:45.144
You take the clothes pin
and put it on the board

54:45.177 --> 54:46.879
and put pictures of mom on it
like this.

54:46.913 --> 54:48.748
Then you hang it on the wall.

54:48.781 --> 54:51.117
We're making one for each
of us, including you.

54:52.018 --> 54:53.219
That's okay, isn't it?

54:54.053 --> 54:55.388
It's jake.

55:00.126 --> 55:01.459
Jake?

55:02.762 --> 55:04.263
He's weird.

55:10.870 --> 55:13.205
Yeah, Denise was great.

55:13.239 --> 55:15.007
And she took care of everything
too,

55:15.041 --> 55:17.410
the house, the girls, me.

55:18.711 --> 55:20.046
You must miss her a lot.

55:21.347 --> 55:24.684
You have no idea, I mean,
she was everything to me

55:25.685 --> 55:28.520
and it was amazing how in sync
we were.

55:28.553 --> 55:30.423
I mean, I'd start a
sentence, she'd finish it.

55:30.455 --> 55:32.258
She always knew what I was
thinking.

55:34.193 --> 55:37.529
And she had this way of singing
things,

55:37.562 --> 55:39.732
things that you and I would
normally say.

55:41.167 --> 55:42.134
Like what?

55:42.168 --> 55:43.369
Well, you know, like mundane
stuff

55:43.402 --> 55:46.604
like "The laundry needs to be
folded"

55:46.639 --> 55:51.609
or "I'm starving, why don't
you take me to dinner?"

55:51.644 --> 55:54.447
Actually, it was kind of
annoying but,

55:55.982 --> 55:58.317
I'd give anything to hear her do
it again.

55:59.517 --> 56:03.022
Well, maybe she did that
to get a reaction out of you.

56:03.055 --> 56:05.825
Women like to keep men
on their toes you know?

56:05.858 --> 56:07.592
Oh, she was good at that.

56:07.625 --> 56:10.463
Every time I turned around,
she was redecorating the house,

56:10.495 --> 56:14.734
paint, curtains,
knick-knacks, you name it.

56:14.767 --> 56:16.836
So, it made it that much
harder when she died.

56:16.869 --> 56:18.536
I just couldn't look around

56:18.570 --> 56:21.007
anywhere in this place and not
see her.

56:23.009 --> 56:24.744
So, I wound up packing it all
up.

56:25.978 --> 56:28.447
Didn't really talk about
her much with the girls.

56:31.183 --> 56:33.052
I was kind of a shit father
actually.

56:34.619 --> 56:36.322
I wasn't very fair to them at
all.

56:39.091 --> 56:41.994
Well look, you said
that they're teenagers.

56:42.028 --> 56:45.431
I mean, come on, they're old
enough to know how you feel.

56:45.464 --> 56:47.366
Maybe, but it still wasn't
fair.

56:49.435 --> 56:54.440
So, I pulled everything
back out, gave it to them.

56:57.009 --> 56:58.677
It's not easy looking at it but,

57:00.479 --> 57:02.681
I don't want them to forget her.

57:06.118 --> 57:08.687
I'm sure that they won't.

57:08.721 --> 57:11.323
You're lucky, you have those
things

57:11.357 --> 57:12.792
and you have your daughters.

57:15.261 --> 57:16.729
When I lost Gerde...

57:18.596 --> 57:20.598
Who's Gerde?

57:21.566 --> 57:22.935
He was my fiance.

57:24.003 --> 57:25.271
You were engaged?

57:26.205 --> 57:27.540
Yeah.

57:27.907 --> 57:29.075
Well what happened?

57:32.445 --> 57:33.479
He was killed.

57:35.147 --> 57:37.049
God, I'm sorry about
that.

57:37.950 --> 57:39.452
Yeah, me too.

57:41.619 --> 57:45.891
You remember that castle that
you went to? Neuschwanstein.

57:46.792 --> 57:48.626
It's where I met him.

57:48.661 --> 57:50.029
You're kidding.

57:50.062 --> 57:52.465
No, he worked there for a
while.

57:53.598 --> 57:55.701
God, he was a wonderful man.

57:57.770 --> 57:59.672
You know, a lot of people said

57:59.705 --> 58:02.208
that I was too old to get
married.

58:02.241 --> 58:03.909
Past my prime and you know,

58:03.943 --> 58:05.911
no man would ever look at me
that way.

58:07.480 --> 58:11.517
But he was different, he
saw past the wrapping.

58:14.120 --> 58:16.255
He saw me for who I really am.

58:19.624 --> 58:20.860
When did he die?

58:23.028 --> 58:24.964
Right before I came back to
America.

58:27.333 --> 58:28.868
So, that's why you came back?

58:30.069 --> 58:31.470
It's one of the reasons.

58:32.671 --> 58:33.973
Again, I'm really sorry.

58:35.641 --> 58:37.910
Yeah, me too.

58:39.945 --> 58:41.380
And all I have left of him

58:41.413 --> 58:43.949
is a framed photograph, that's
it.

58:45.851 --> 58:47.953
So, every day I talk to it,

58:48.821 --> 58:50.923
I tell him how much I still love
him.

58:52.258 --> 58:53.659
How much I still miss him.

58:58.030 --> 59:00.032
But now you have a new man,
right?

59:02.001 --> 59:03.469
Is that what you are?

59:04.703 --> 59:07.206
I was talking about the
guy that you told me about,

59:07.239 --> 59:08.908
the married guy.

59:10.242 --> 59:11.477
Nobody's perfect.

59:14.013 --> 59:16.482
You know what, I'm tired, It's
late.

59:16.515 --> 59:17.850
I think I'm gonna sign off.

59:19.752 --> 59:21.620
Hey, if I hit a nerve there,
I'm sorry.

59:21.655 --> 59:23.722
I really didn't mean anything by
it.

59:24.890 --> 59:27.026
It's okay, I really am tired
though.

59:30.296 --> 59:31.964
Good night, Eva.

59:33.499 --> 59:35.000
Good night, Will.

1:00:00.993 --> 1:00:02.494
You're late.

1:00:02.861 --> 1:00:04.196
I knew you'd be up.

1:00:05.097 --> 1:00:06.332
Did anybody see you?

1:00:06.365 --> 1:00:07.566
No.

1:00:07.600 --> 1:00:09.301
Do you have something for me?

1:00:12.905 --> 1:00:15.808
You wouldn't be here if I
didn't.

1:01:24.877 --> 1:01:26.646
Don't!

1:01:28.013 --> 1:01:29.348
No!

1:02:23.936 --> 1:02:26.673
So, what happened to
him?

1:02:28.607 --> 1:02:30.710
I'm not sure of all the
details but...

1:02:32.244 --> 1:02:33.579
Actually he got shot.

1:02:35.147 --> 1:02:36.348
You're Kidding me.

1:02:37.784 --> 1:02:41.887
No, I'm not. Apparently
he went to the wrong house,

1:02:41.920 --> 1:02:43.322
thought he was calling on some
guy

1:02:43.355 --> 1:02:45.859
that wanted to buy a
piece of farm equipment.

1:02:45.891 --> 1:02:47.960
Guy told him he'd be out
back working on something

1:02:47.993 --> 1:02:49.662
and to go on in.

1:02:49.962 --> 1:02:52.965
My father entered and the
woman who actually lived there,

1:02:52.998 --> 1:02:55.934
mistook him for a robber and
shot him.

1:02:58.705 --> 1:03:01.073
My God, that's really
horrible.

1:03:01.106 --> 1:03:02.809
It must've been very hard for
you.

1:03:04.677 --> 1:03:06.145
Well, actually I was pretty
close

1:03:06.178 --> 1:03:08.180
to the scene of the
accident when it happened.

1:03:08.213 --> 1:03:10.549
I was running errands for my
boss

1:03:10.582 --> 1:03:13.787
and I fell off my bike or
something,

1:03:13.820 --> 1:03:16.155
hit my head, blacked out.

1:03:16.188 --> 1:03:17.389
I don't remember any of it,

1:03:17.423 --> 1:03:19.324
just the little bit my mother
told me.

1:03:21.293 --> 1:03:23.696
What happened to the woman who
shot him?

1:03:25.632 --> 1:03:27.667
You know, I have no idea.

1:03:27.700 --> 1:03:29.869
And like I said, my mother
never really talked about it

1:03:29.903 --> 1:03:33.338
and by the time I got old
enough to look into it myself,

1:03:33.372 --> 1:03:38.076
I figured nothing's gonna bring
him back,

1:03:38.110 --> 1:03:40.012
so why bother digging it all up
again?

1:03:42.347 --> 1:03:43.850
Poor woman.

1:03:47.887 --> 1:03:50.088
My mother or the woman
who shot my father?

1:03:51.557 --> 1:03:52.892
Both.

1:04:10.509 --> 1:04:12.411
Are you in your safe place,
William?

1:04:14.213 --> 1:04:15.547
Yes.

1:04:16.683 --> 1:04:18.918
Now let's go back to that day.

1:04:20.687 --> 1:04:24.022
You're on the farm with your
father working on the tractor?

1:04:25.591 --> 1:04:27.159
Yes.

1:04:27.192 --> 1:04:28.928
What's his demeanor?

1:04:28.962 --> 1:04:31.263
He's upset about something,

1:04:31.296 --> 1:04:33.532
but he tries to hide it from me.

1:04:33.565 --> 1:04:35.234
What happens next?

1:04:35.267 --> 1:04:37.236
I finished my morning chores,

1:04:37.269 --> 1:04:40.239
then I go to my job at the
grocery store.

1:04:41.340 --> 1:04:44.376
So, you're at the
grocers, what happens next?

1:04:45.244 --> 1:04:48.347
I stock some shelves
and I sweep the floor,

1:04:48.380 --> 1:04:51.083
then my boss tells me I
need to make a delivery.

1:04:52.618 --> 1:04:55.087
Pack the groceries in a
box and strap it to my bike

1:04:55.120 --> 1:04:57.256
and then I ride to the house.

1:04:58.457 --> 1:04:59.792
I get there and...

1:05:03.696 --> 1:05:05.163
It's okay.

1:05:05.197 --> 1:05:06.164
It's all right, you know what,

1:05:06.198 --> 1:05:08.001
this all happened a long time
ago.

1:05:08.033 --> 1:05:09.368
You were just an observer.

1:05:09.401 --> 1:05:13.438
Now, watch this as if it
was a television show.

1:05:13.472 --> 1:05:15.607
Just tell me what happened next.

1:05:15.642 --> 1:05:17.409
I get to the house

1:05:17.442 --> 1:05:19.879
and then I pick up the groceries

1:05:19.913 --> 1:05:22.782
and I walk to the basement
hatch.

1:05:23.850 --> 1:05:26.184
Do you
always deliver there?

1:05:26.218 --> 1:05:27.252
Yes.

1:05:27.286 --> 1:05:28.788
Why?

1:05:28.821 --> 1:05:29.789
I don't know.

1:05:29.822 --> 1:05:32.157
It's just what she wants me to
do.

1:05:32.190 --> 1:05:33.760
What do you do
next?

1:05:33.793 --> 1:05:37.195
I go down the
stairs and knock on the door.

1:05:38.263 --> 1:05:39.866
Who answers the
door?

1:05:39.899 --> 1:05:41.099
I don't see her,

1:05:41.133 --> 1:05:42.936
she says to set the groceries
down.

1:05:45.772 --> 1:05:47.105
What do you see
now?

1:05:47.974 --> 1:05:50.542
Looking at
the calendar on the wall.

1:05:50.576 --> 1:05:51.577
What does it
say?

1:05:52.411 --> 1:05:54.246
June, 1946.

1:05:55.380 --> 1:05:58.216
There's a picture right next
to the calendar on the wall.

1:06:00.085 --> 1:06:01.086
It's familiar.

1:06:02.487 --> 1:06:03.990
It's a castle.

1:06:06.625 --> 1:06:08.460
There's a man.

1:06:10.429 --> 1:06:11.631
It's a picture of a man.

1:06:21.074 --> 1:06:22.407
William.

1:06:23.843 --> 1:06:25.277
What did you see?

1:06:28.014 --> 1:06:29.514
Nothing, nothing.

1:06:32.551 --> 1:06:34.988
Just, you know...

1:06:35.021 --> 1:06:40.026
To see something from
so long ago, so vividly.

1:06:40.192 --> 1:06:42.260
It's okay, just take slow,
deep breaths.

1:06:43.295 --> 1:06:44.964
What did you see?

1:06:49.836 --> 1:06:50.870
I can't do this anymore.

1:06:50.903 --> 1:06:52.270
We can do this next time.

1:06:52.304 --> 1:06:53.438
Are you okay?

1:06:56.909 --> 1:06:59.277
Think, you can remember this.

1:06:59.311 --> 1:07:01.179
Where was that house?

1:07:01.213 --> 1:07:03.082
Think William, think.

1:07:03.116 --> 1:07:04.216
You had to go across that
bridge.

1:07:04.249 --> 1:07:06.418
It was that little house in
Ludlowville.

1:07:07.252 --> 1:07:09.088
If Eva's the same woman,

1:07:09.122 --> 1:07:12.224
no wonder she didn't want
to tell you how old she is.

1:07:17.529 --> 1:07:19.032
Yes?

1:07:19.065 --> 1:07:21.166
Is Eva here?

1:07:21.199 --> 1:07:22.401
Who?

1:07:22.434 --> 1:07:25.104
Eva, I think she lives here.

1:07:25.138 --> 1:07:26.105
There's no Eva here,

1:07:26.139 --> 1:07:28.306
I've lived here for 15
years, never has been.

1:07:30.009 --> 1:07:31.309
Sorry.

1:08:52.058 --> 1:08:53.826
Will, are you there?

1:08:57.362 --> 1:08:58.664
Will, are you there?

1:08:59.832 --> 1:09:04.837
Will, are you on the air? Over.

1:09:11.144 --> 1:09:12.645
I'm here, Eva.

1:09:13.212 --> 1:09:15.915
Hey, what's buzzin' cousin?

1:09:17.016 --> 1:09:18.217
Sounds like you are.

1:09:19.218 --> 1:09:21.220
Been hitting the booze again?

1:09:21.254 --> 1:09:25.258
Actually, yeah. Well only a
little bit.

1:09:25.290 --> 1:09:28.493
I just finished a bit of a
project.

1:09:28.527 --> 1:09:30.730
So, I'm celebrating a little
bit.

1:09:30.763 --> 1:09:33.465
How about you, what are you
doing today?

1:09:33.498 --> 1:09:35.768
Eva, that picture that
you were telling me about

1:09:35.802 --> 1:09:39.038
on your wall, the one at the
castle.

1:09:39.071 --> 1:09:40.405
Yeah?

1:09:41.808 --> 1:09:43.608
How long have you
had that?

1:09:45.645 --> 1:09:47.079
A little over a year.

1:09:47.113 --> 1:09:50.283
I had a friend send it to me
from Germany after the war.

1:09:51.516 --> 1:09:52.852
The war.

1:09:53.418 --> 1:09:56.722
You mean the second World War?

1:09:58.157 --> 1:10:00.592
Well, yeah, what else
would I be referring to?

1:10:02.695 --> 1:10:04.462
You drinking a little
early yourself, Will?

1:10:04.496 --> 1:10:05.965
How is this possible?

1:10:08.734 --> 1:10:10.368
Will, are you still
there?

1:10:10.402 --> 1:10:11.871
Eva.

1:10:11.904 --> 1:10:13.239
Yeah?

1:10:14.573 --> 1:10:17.677
What's the name of the kid
that delivers your groceries?

1:10:18.711 --> 1:10:20.279
Why do you want to know that?

1:10:21.580 --> 1:10:22.982
What's his name?

1:10:25.483 --> 1:10:26.819
Billy.

1:10:29.487 --> 1:10:31.123
Eva, what year is
it?

1:10:33.125 --> 1:10:36.262
1946. You have been
drinking.

1:10:40.900 --> 1:10:43.302
Will, you still there?

1:10:44.170 --> 1:10:45.671
I've gotta go.

1:10:54.814 --> 1:10:57.016
She's in the past.

1:10:57.049 --> 1:10:58.718
She's in the past.

1:11:00.887 --> 1:11:02.722
How is this happening?

1:11:04.156 --> 1:11:05.925
This isn't happening.

1:11:07.693 --> 1:11:09.161
Look's
like they hit a wreck out-

1:11:09.195 --> 1:11:10.863
She was a
big one.

1:11:10.897 --> 1:11:14.000
That skirt was so high!

1:11:14.033 --> 1:11:15.400
You
knew there'd be a problem-

1:11:15.433 --> 1:11:18.104
That dame
would...

1:11:19.404 --> 1:11:20.706
William.

1:11:25.645 --> 1:11:28.180
Who is this? What do you want?

1:11:30.615 --> 1:11:33.786
You can't trust
her.

1:11:36.956 --> 1:11:38.057
You're breaking up.

1:11:38.925 --> 1:11:40.026
My journal.

1:11:43.863 --> 1:11:47.333
QC, this is K-2-W-M-O, who is
this?

1:11:49.235 --> 1:11:52.838
K-2-W-M-O.

1:11:55.241 --> 1:11:58.811
Yes, this is K-2-W-M-O!
You've reached K-2-W-M-O!

1:11:59.745 --> 1:12:03.816
K-2-W-M-O?

1:12:03.849 --> 1:12:04.951
Yes, this...

1:12:04.984 --> 1:12:08.020
I'm K-2-W-M-O! Who is this?!

1:12:08.054 --> 1:12:12.124
K-2-W-M-O.

1:12:12.158 --> 1:12:13.491
Read my journal.

1:12:17.196 --> 1:12:18.764
William, my journal.

1:12:22.301 --> 1:12:25.638
K-2-W-M-O, my journal.

1:12:33.379 --> 1:12:34.714
Dad?

1:12:42.254 --> 1:12:43.222
Billy.

1:12:48.794 --> 1:12:50.062
Master William.

1:12:52.865 --> 1:12:54.900
"Today I was headed for
Joe's when I saw her again,

1:12:54.934 --> 1:12:56.168
she was just leaving the drug
store.

1:12:56.202 --> 1:12:58.704
She saw me looking at her and
she gave me that chilly look.

1:12:58.738 --> 1:13:00.572
She walked away without looking
back.

1:13:01.807 --> 1:13:03.109
I've been keeping an
eye out for that dame,

1:13:03.142 --> 1:13:04.110
I know I shouldn't,

1:13:04.143 --> 1:13:05.711
but there's something
mysterious about her.

1:13:05.745 --> 1:13:06.912
Haven't seen her though.

1:13:09.248 --> 1:13:11.384
I was in Ludlowville this
morning and saw her again.

1:13:11.417 --> 1:13:13.652
She was setting her milk
bottle out for the milkman.

1:13:13.686 --> 1:13:14.787
She looked up at me this time.

1:13:14.820 --> 1:13:17.223
I fancy she might've smiled a
little,

1:13:21.193 --> 1:13:22.560
I guess I'm a sinner after all.

1:13:22.594 --> 1:13:24.363
I've been with her four times
now,

1:13:24.397 --> 1:13:26.032
I know what's wrong, but I can't
help it.

1:13:26.065 --> 1:13:28.566
She's gotten under my skin
somehow.

1:13:28.600 --> 1:13:30.736
I don't know why, she's not a
young woman.

1:13:30.770 --> 1:13:33.105
I can't let Margaret find out.

1:13:33.973 --> 1:13:35.741
I've still got her and Billy to
think of,

1:13:35.775 --> 1:13:38.377
this would not bode well
in Sir William's kingdom."

1:13:42.481 --> 1:13:43.816
God, dad.

1:14:03.436 --> 1:14:04.770
June 11th?

1:14:14.447 --> 1:14:16.449
You gotta be kidding me.

1:14:16.482 --> 1:14:18.851
"I've never been so
fucking furious in my life.

1:14:18.884 --> 1:14:21.520
I thought I was falling
in love and with what?

1:14:21.554 --> 1:14:23.289
A lying bitch.

1:14:23.322 --> 1:14:25.958
She sure put one over on me, on
all of us.

1:14:25.991 --> 1:14:27.293
She's a fucking..."

1:14:38.003 --> 1:14:40.239
What did you just ask
me?

1:14:40.272 --> 1:14:41.774
What's his name?

1:14:42.241 --> 1:14:44.643
That's none of your damn
business.

1:14:44.677 --> 1:14:45.878
It's important.

1:14:46.846 --> 1:14:48.447
No, it's not.

1:14:48.481 --> 1:14:50.282
I need to know, Eva.

1:14:50.316 --> 1:14:52.785
Well then you are
destined to be disappointed.

1:14:52.818 --> 1:14:54.520
All right, fine, then tell me
this.

1:14:54.553 --> 1:14:56.822
Have the two of you
been fighting recently?

1:14:56.856 --> 1:14:59.125
Again, none of your damn
business.

1:14:59.158 --> 1:15:00.326
You have, haven't you?

1:15:00.359 --> 1:15:02.495
'Cause his name's Gerald, isn't
it?

1:15:02.528 --> 1:15:04.029
His name is Gerald.

1:15:05.664 --> 1:15:06.699
I'm right, aren't I?

1:15:09.502 --> 1:15:11.770
How do you know these things?

1:15:11.804 --> 1:15:14.140
How do I know what,
that his name's Gerald

1:15:14.173 --> 1:15:16.108
or that you're a Nazi?

1:15:16.142 --> 1:15:18.744
'Cause you are, aren't you?
You're a Nazi!

1:15:20.079 --> 1:15:23.482
Eva, I'm right, aren't I?!

1:15:23.516 --> 1:15:24.683
Don't call me again.

1:15:26.952 --> 1:15:27.953
Eva!

1:15:29.955 --> 1:15:34.460
Eva! You're a Nazi, aren't you,
Eva?!

1:15:35.928 --> 1:15:36.929
Eva!

1:15:37.763 --> 1:15:38.764
Fuck!

1:15:44.470 --> 1:15:47.006
Dr. Jennings, this is William.

1:15:47.039 --> 1:15:48.941
I need to see you as soon as
possible.

1:15:50.009 --> 1:15:51.377
I need to finish this.

1:15:56.549 --> 1:15:58.784
Han, I've been signaling,

1:15:58.817 --> 1:16:00.286
you aren't answering me.

1:16:00.319 --> 1:16:04.123
I'm really vulnerable
right now, somebody knows.

1:16:04.156 --> 1:16:06.625
I still have all of this stuff.

1:16:06.660 --> 1:16:10.629
Han, please pick up. Do you
copy?

1:16:10.664 --> 1:16:14.567
I have everything ready here,
nobody's picked anything up.

1:16:14.600 --> 1:16:18.304
This is so important, you
have to get back to me.

1:16:18.337 --> 1:16:21.675
Han, goddammit! Where are you?!

1:16:28.080 --> 1:16:29.748
Let's go back through that
day.

1:16:34.220 --> 1:16:35.454
What happens next?

1:16:35.487 --> 1:16:38.190
She opens the basement
door and I go inside.

1:16:40.726 --> 1:16:42.094
What do you
see?

1:16:42.127 --> 1:16:44.430
Just stuff, a
calendar,

1:16:46.832 --> 1:16:47.967
a picture on the wall,

1:16:49.703 --> 1:16:50.903
a picture of a guy,

1:16:53.038 --> 1:16:55.407
a gun like my uncle used to own,

1:16:56.508 --> 1:16:57.843
a clock.

1:16:58.344 --> 1:17:00.479
Do either
of you say anything?

1:17:00.512 --> 1:17:02.414
I tell her that the bill is
3.19.

1:17:04.083 --> 1:17:05.217
She pays me the money.

1:17:06.619 --> 1:17:07.786
I start to leave.

1:17:09.255 --> 1:17:10.756
What is it,
William?

1:17:10.789 --> 1:17:12.258
I hear something.

1:17:13.092 --> 1:17:14.059
What do you
hear?

1:17:14.093 --> 1:17:16.730
Shouting. It's a
man.

1:17:18.364 --> 1:17:19.565
I'm scared.

1:17:19.598 --> 1:17:20.766
Why are you
scared?

1:17:20.799 --> 1:17:23.535
I can hear them
moving, she might need help.

1:17:24.536 --> 1:17:26.872
I keep hearing them shouting.

1:17:26.905 --> 1:17:28.675
Can you make out what they're
saying?

1:17:28.708 --> 1:17:32.778
Not all of it, but I
keep hearing a man's voice.

1:17:34.913 --> 1:17:36.048
What then?

1:17:38.752 --> 1:17:39.753
The gun...

1:17:39.818 --> 1:17:42.121
- What about the gun?
- It's gone.

1:17:44.123 --> 1:17:45.858
I hear the voice again.

1:17:45.891 --> 1:17:47.860
"You bitch, how could you?!"

1:17:49.495 --> 1:17:51.731
Can you tell
who the voice belongs to?

1:17:52.598 --> 1:17:53.932
It's my father.

1:17:55.735 --> 1:17:56.969
Remember William, you're safe.

1:17:57.002 --> 1:18:00.506
You're just observing.
What do you see next?

1:18:00.539 --> 1:18:02.107
I'm upstairs.

1:18:02.141 --> 1:18:04.711
The woman and my dad, they're
arguing.

1:18:05.911 --> 1:18:07.413
She has a gun.

1:18:08.648 --> 1:18:10.717
And then?

1:18:14.019 --> 1:18:16.021
What's happening now?

1:18:16.055 --> 1:18:17.657
I'm running
away from the house

1:18:17.691 --> 1:18:19.191
through the woods.

1:18:19.224 --> 1:18:23.362
I just keep running and
running and running and then...

1:18:28.802 --> 1:18:30.135
Darkness.

1:18:38.277 --> 1:18:40.512
Nothing but darkness.

1:18:44.651 --> 1:18:47.219
I can't speak or move,
but I hear them talking.

1:18:48.120 --> 1:18:51.758
They asked me questions
but I can't remember.

1:18:51.791 --> 1:18:53.492
My mother tells them to leave me
alone.

1:18:53.525 --> 1:18:56.796
My father's dead, it
was a terrible accident.

1:18:56.830 --> 1:18:58.732
She can't afford to lose me as
well.

1:19:00.032 --> 1:19:01.533
I'm just a kid.

1:19:03.869 --> 1:19:05.204
I suffered enough.

1:19:09.475 --> 1:19:10.943
Will, you're safe, you're here
with me.

1:19:10.976 --> 1:19:12.111
You saw something terrible,

1:19:12.144 --> 1:19:15.280
but now we know what the
darkness is covering up.

1:19:16.850 --> 1:19:19.719
It's okay. It's okay.

1:19:19.753 --> 1:19:21.220
Now we can work on fixing it.

1:19:22.921 --> 1:19:23.989
Fix?

1:19:24.022 --> 1:19:25.524
We can fix it.

1:19:26.558 --> 1:19:31.563
My father died on June
12th, 1946, June 12th.

1:19:32.364 --> 1:19:34.634
38 Years ago, today.

1:19:34.667 --> 1:19:37.837
Did you realize that when
you set this appointment?

1:19:37.871 --> 1:19:41.841
Anniversaries can be important
milestones in therapy.

1:19:44.943 --> 1:19:46.612
You said coincidences.

1:19:48.013 --> 1:19:50.315
I don't believe in them, I
still don't.

1:19:52.317 --> 1:19:56.522
Everything happens in its
proper time and place.

1:19:58.357 --> 1:19:59.692
Time.

1:20:14.606 --> 1:20:15.574
William!

1:20:15.607 --> 1:20:17.042
I can still stop it.

1:20:22.782 --> 1:20:24.717
The clock in her bunker said
5:07.

1:20:27.019 --> 1:20:28.520
There's still time.

1:20:30.155 --> 1:20:31.156
Eva?

1:20:35.762 --> 1:20:37.730
Eva, I know you're there.

1:20:37.764 --> 1:20:40.365
I don't know who you
are, but you need to stop.

1:20:41.233 --> 1:20:44.369
I know who you are, you
stay away from Gerald.

1:20:44.403 --> 1:20:47.506
Don't you ever contact me
again, do you understand me?

1:20:48.540 --> 1:20:50.643
Are you listening to
me, Eva?

1:20:50.677 --> 1:20:51.845
Nazi bitch!

1:20:56.248 --> 1:20:58.984
You leave Gerald alone, do you
hear me?

1:20:59.017 --> 1:21:00.486
Billy.

1:21:00.519 --> 1:21:01.888
Hi, Miss Saints.

1:21:01.921 --> 1:21:03.756
Yeah, this just really isn't
the time.

1:21:03.790 --> 1:21:04.824
Do you hear me, you
bitch?

1:21:04.858 --> 1:21:05.859
Just doing routine.

1:21:05.892 --> 1:21:07.760
- Just put it down
- Don't you dare touch him.

1:21:09.729 --> 1:21:10.830
Don't you dare touch him.

1:21:12.064 --> 1:21:13.833
Bitch, where are you?

1:21:13.867 --> 1:21:16.335
Just get out, Billy.

1:21:16.368 --> 1:21:17.436
Is that my dad?

1:21:17.469 --> 1:21:18.805
Get out.

1:21:19.171 --> 1:21:20.606
Eva, I know you can
hear me.

1:21:20.640 --> 1:21:21.941
But the money.

1:21:21.975 --> 1:21:24.744
Dammit, Eva you stay away
from Gerald, do you hear me?

1:21:24.777 --> 1:21:27.546
You stay away from Gerald.

1:21:27.579 --> 1:21:28.882
Answer me!

1:21:28.915 --> 1:21:30.917
Eva, you answer me!

1:21:30.950 --> 1:21:32.685
Pick up, Eva!

1:21:32.719 --> 1:21:34.286
Are you listening?

1:21:34.319 --> 1:21:36.188
Eva, you pick up.

1:21:36.221 --> 1:21:37.556
Hello?

1:21:37.924 --> 1:21:39.258
Hello?

1:21:39.826 --> 1:21:41.026
Do you live here?

1:21:42.227 --> 1:21:43.796
Who is this?

1:21:43.830 --> 1:21:46.231
Because I need my
$3.19.

1:21:50.569 --> 1:21:51.905
Billy?

1:21:52.504 --> 1:21:53.973
How do you know my name?

1:21:55.507 --> 1:21:57.309
That doesn't matter right now.

1:21:57.342 --> 1:21:59.177
Is that woman's still there?

1:21:59.211 --> 1:22:02.080
No, she ran out when that
guy upstairs started yelling.

1:22:04.751 --> 1:22:06.585
You said she ran out?

1:22:06.618 --> 1:22:07.987
Yeah, before she paid me.

1:22:13.058 --> 1:22:16.395
Billy, listen to me.
Is the gun still there?

1:22:16.428 --> 1:22:18.965
It would be to your
right over on the shelf.

1:22:21.266 --> 1:22:22.601
Yeah.

1:22:24.069 --> 1:22:26.605
Billy, I want you to
listen to me very carefully.

1:22:27.606 --> 1:22:31.410
I'm a friend of your father's,
your dad is in trouble.

1:22:31.443 --> 1:22:34.814
He's in danger, Billy. That
woman is going to hurt him.

1:22:37.784 --> 1:22:39.852
Billy, I know you.

1:22:43.022 --> 1:22:45.058
I know you know how to use that
gun.

1:23:18.024 --> 1:23:19.358
Dad.

1:23:20.059 --> 1:23:21.393
Billy.

1:23:21.728 --> 1:23:24.931
Son, put the gun down.

1:23:24.964 --> 1:23:27.165
Listen to me, put the gun down.

1:23:27.199 --> 1:23:30.770
- No, he's a little shit.
- No!

1:23:32.105 --> 1:23:33.538
Billy!

1:23:47.086 --> 1:23:48.755
That's the third time this
season,

1:23:48.788 --> 1:23:50.657
he's lost his footing out there.

1:23:50.690 --> 1:23:52.257
Of course, in my state I can't
just go out

1:23:52.290 --> 1:23:54.359
and drag him back to the house.

1:23:54.393 --> 1:23:56.595
And that's when I came
to the sad realization

1:23:56.628 --> 1:23:58.430
that my dad and I had been
working that farm together

1:23:58.463 --> 1:24:00.133
for so many years.

1:24:00.165 --> 1:24:01.134
He's in his late 70's,

1:24:01.166 --> 1:24:03.703
so he's bound to slow down at
some point.

1:24:03.736 --> 1:24:04.771
Guess it was just inevitable

1:24:04.804 --> 1:24:06.338
that we were gonna have
to start thinking about

1:24:06.371 --> 1:24:07.640
bringing somebody else on

1:24:09.142 --> 1:24:11.110
and I can keep doing what I'm
doing.

1:24:12.477 --> 1:24:14.981
I can't run the whole farm by
myself.

1:24:15.014 --> 1:24:16.515
Well, that's understandable.

1:24:17.684 --> 1:24:19.752
How's it going outside
of the business though?

1:24:19.786 --> 1:24:21.620
How about with your personal
life?

1:24:23.255 --> 1:24:24.556
Everything's fine I guess.

1:24:26.025 --> 1:24:28.761
Been having a hard time sleeping
lately.

1:24:28.795 --> 1:24:30.295
Headaches again?

1:24:31.831 --> 1:24:33.432
There's always the headaches,
right?

1:24:33.465 --> 1:24:34.533
I mean, they can patch you up

1:24:34.566 --> 1:24:35.835
after getting shot in the head,

1:24:35.868 --> 1:24:38.104
but they can't get rid
of a goddamn headache.

1:24:39.271 --> 1:24:42.075
No, what's keeping me up is a
dream.

1:24:44.877 --> 1:24:46.545
Tell me about
it.

1:24:49.381 --> 1:24:54.386
I'm married in it,
but my wife's not there.

1:24:54.586 --> 1:24:56.022
You know, dreams can get weird

1:24:56.055 --> 1:24:57.389
like when you're outside,

1:24:57.422 --> 1:25:01.226
but you're inside at the same
time, you know what I mean?

1:25:01.259 --> 1:25:05.198
But I have kids, two daughters.

1:25:06.666 --> 1:25:10.870
I swear I can see their faces,
I can hear their voices.

1:25:12.071 --> 1:25:13.639
It's just so real.

1:25:14.841 --> 1:25:18.310
Sometimes the things
that we deeply desire,

1:25:18.343 --> 1:25:20.713
they can show up in our sleeping
minds.

1:25:21.781 --> 1:25:23.448
It doesn't feel made up
though.

1:25:26.152 --> 1:25:27.419
It's just too familiar.

1:25:29.621 --> 1:25:32.624
Something to
delve into next time, perhaps?

1:25:33.960 --> 1:25:35.460
Sounds good.

1:25:36.461 --> 1:25:40.166
Well, it's all the
time we have for today.

1:25:41.701 --> 1:25:43.636
She's kicking me
out.

1:25:43.669 --> 1:25:45.004
Not at all.

1:25:45.671 --> 1:25:47.272
You be safe, Will.

1:25:47.305 --> 1:25:48.741
You too, Lydia.

1:26:09.962 --> 1:26:11.530
William.

1:26:16.301 --> 1:26:19.772
I need you to wake up now,
sleepy-head

1:26:27.880 --> 1:26:29.115
time to get up.

1:27:57.670 --> 1:27:59.372
It's not your
time.

1:30:15.941 --> 1:30:18.144
Hello?
