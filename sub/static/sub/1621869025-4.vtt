Hunt, you had a rough year.

Jimmy talked about it, though?

18:04.584 --> 18:06.419
Once or twice.

18:09.464 --> 18:12.509
All right,
we talked about it, but...

18:12.509 --> 18:15.220
it was only because...

18:15.220 --> 18:17.096
we had a pool going.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.599
Who did?

18:19.599 --> 18:21.518

team had a bet going

18:21.518 --> 18:23.478

on the dance team.

18:23.478 --> 18:25.355

That's why the guys were mad
when he kept fucking up.

18:27.398 --> 18:29.108
The guys thought
he was keeping his score low

18:29.108 --> 18:30.902

Okay, you said that Jimmy
had to keep his score low,

18:41.204 --> 18:43.456

is based on points?

18:43.456 --> 18:45.458

have to keep his score low
