WEBVTT

00:19.160 --> 00:21.920
[Frank]
I gave you Aldo fucking Delucci.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.320
[agent]  Not quite. He's gonna walk.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.640
Fucking FBI.

00:25.720 --> 00:28.400
No wonder
the fucking terrorists are winning!

00:31.360 --> 00:34.200
[Robert] You're the European cop
who's looking for some wise guy.

00:37.640 --> 00:40.480
- Is this blackmail?
- Definitely.

00:40.560 --> 00:44.040
Where's that piece of shit
Frank Tagliano hiding, huh?

00:44.200 --> 00:46.120
- [grunts]
- [gunshot echoes]

00:46.200 --> 00:49.560
[man in Norwegian]   May peace be with
the memory of Geir Tvedt.

00:49.640 --> 00:53.320
[in English] Pack your lederhosen, boys.
You're going to Norway.

00:53.400 --> 00:55.400
[in Norwegian]
There's something that's not right.

00:55.480 --> 00:58.320
[in English]
Wakey wakey, Frankie boy.

00:58.400 --> 01:00.120
Shit! It's not him.

01:00.200 --> 01:02.560
- Wait!
- Calm down!

01:03.600 --> 01:05.320
[cheers and applause]

01:06.800 --> 01:09.240
[theme music playing]

01:44.720 --> 01:46.320
Marrona mia.

01:47.760 --> 01:50.640
[Jonas in Norwegian]
Has he been beaten up?

01:50.720 --> 01:55.120
[in English] No, no. He, uh...
fell down some stairs.

01:57.840 --> 02:00.560
Why don't you wait over here?

02:00.640 --> 02:03.880
Sit down and read
some magazines there.

02:15.160 --> 02:18.160
[in Norwegian]
Look how his mother's fussin' over him.

02:18.240 --> 02:20.520
[Johnny in English]
Yeah, Norwegian moms, huh?

02:21.360 --> 02:23.120
Let's go.

02:25.760 --> 02:28.360
[in Norwegian]
Oh. Look who's here.

02:28.440 --> 02:31.560
- Is it Dad?
- No, it's not Dad.

02:31.640 --> 02:35.000
[in English]
Feeling a little under the weather?

02:35.080 --> 02:36.560
[in Norwegian]
I brought along some flowers.

02:36.640 --> 02:43.040
How considerate. Thank you.
With a vase and everything.

02:43.120 --> 02:44.840
Ah.

02:44.920 --> 02:46.280
That's really nice.

02:46.360 --> 02:49.680
[in English]
Arne, who did this?

02:52.600 --> 02:54.200
[mumbling] Frankie boy.

02:54.280 --> 02:55.480
Huh?

02:58.840 --> 03:02.000
[in Norwegian]
They called me Frankie boy.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.360
- "Frankie boy"?
- Mm.

03:06.200 --> 03:09.240
Do you understand this?
What did you say?

03:09.320 --> 03:11.560
That can't be what they said.

03:11.640 --> 03:14.680
They called me Frank... Mom?

03:14.760 --> 03:18.320
- Frankie Mom?
- Mom?

03:19.280 --> 03:22.480
[Johnny in English] Keep in mind, every
now and then, when you have a good hand,

03:22.560 --> 03:25.680
you're gonna wanna check
to throw the other guys off.

03:25.760 --> 03:28.040
You remember what check means?

03:28.120 --> 03:29.560
That's my boy!

03:29.640 --> 03:32.840
[in Norwegian] Right, Jonas.
I've unpacked the pajamas,

03:32.920 --> 03:36.960
your toothbrush and your retainer.

03:37.040 --> 03:40.560
And you have to remember
to try on the folk costume.

03:40.640 --> 03:44.560
Now, Jonas.
You look so nice in a folk costume.

03:44.640 --> 03:48.560
He needs it for when he's giving
his speech on the National Day.

03:48.640 --> 03:50.800
[in English]
I know, I know, I know.

03:50.880 --> 03:54.440
[in Norwegian]
I'm going to miss you.

03:54.520 --> 03:56.320
Relax, Mom.

03:56.400 --> 04:00.000
[in English] Honey, relax.
You're only going for two days.

04:00.080 --> 04:01.480
- You have a good trip.
- Okay.

04:01.560 --> 04:02.600
- Okay?
- Good-bye.

04:02.680 --> 04:03.800
Don't worry about a thing.

04:03.880 --> 04:05.480
[in Norwegian] Good-bye.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.880
[in English] If we have to stay
in this fucking hellhole much longer,

04:18.960 --> 04:21.320
I think I'm gonna go insane.

04:24.760 --> 04:27.000
[woman strumming guitar and singing]

04:27.080 --> 04:30.040
Here we go with that fucking song.

04:37.480 --> 04:39.440
All right, all right.

04:39.520 --> 04:41.280
I'll drive into town in a couple of days.

04:41.360 --> 04:43.720
If the coast is clear, we'll make a move.

04:48.440 --> 04:51.800
[Johnny] Come on, let me see it.
How bad could it be?

04:52.760 --> 04:54.680
[sighs]

04:55.360 --> 04:56.400
Ho ho!

04:56.480 --> 05:00.320
Okay. Pretty bad.

05:00.400 --> 05:04.400
Now, look, can't you just wear it
for one day and make her happy?

05:04.480 --> 05:07.040
[in Norwegian]
I look like a complete dweeb.

05:12.960 --> 05:16.040
[in English]
Okay, fuck  The Sound of Music.

05:16.120 --> 05:18.400
Let's go downtown
and get you some real threads.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.720
Come on.

05:29.080 --> 05:30.240
So?

05:30.320 --> 05:32.240
[in Norwegian]
There are rumors about two Americans

05:32.320 --> 05:36.200
causing a shitload of trouble in town,
but no one knows where they are.

05:39.080 --> 05:42.720
[in English]
Let's beef up security at the club, huh?

05:43.840 --> 05:44.840
And, uh...

05:46.240 --> 05:48.000
Bring the bikers in.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.440
Have them track these cocksuckers.

05:50.520 --> 05:53.160
[in Norwegian] Is it like you've got
a hunch about who they are?

05:53.240 --> 05:54.440
[in English]
What are you getting at?

05:54.520 --> 05:58.800
[in Norwegian]
I just felt some vibes at the hospital.

05:58.880 --> 06:03.440
[in English]
Do me a favor. Try not to think.

06:03.520 --> 06:06.240
You're gonna hurt yourself. Huh?

06:07.640 --> 06:08.760
Oh!

06:08.840 --> 06:10.720
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.880
[in Norwegian]
Look at that, high society!

06:12.960 --> 06:15.080
[in English]
You're beautiful. Look at you!

06:15.160 --> 06:17.560
You're gonna get laid tonight.

06:25.640 --> 06:28.640
[in Norwegian]
This is the tenth year

06:28.720 --> 06:31.160
I've arranged
the Multicultural Fishing Trip,

06:31.240 --> 06:34.640
so perhaps we should start with a toast.

06:35.800 --> 06:37.400
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

06:39.120 --> 06:42.560
This thing here is an incinerating toilet.

06:42.640 --> 06:45.720
It's very simple and practical.

06:45.800 --> 06:49.160
You just take this coffee filter,

06:49.240 --> 06:52.040
as I call it,
and then you put that here...

06:52.960 --> 06:57.160
Like so. And then you can

06:57.240 --> 07:01.840
poop-whoop or poo-poo,
whatever the need be.

07:01.920 --> 07:05.960
We then pack the bag
around the excrement.

07:08.040 --> 07:12.560
Then we close the lid and press here.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.040
[clicking]

07:16.120 --> 07:18.520
What's going on?

07:18.600 --> 07:19.880
Hello?

07:19.960 --> 07:21.920
Let me see.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.000
Fuck!

07:27.080 --> 07:29.640
- Did you burn yourself?
- It's okay.

07:37.440 --> 07:43.120
I was a graduating senior myself
in Stavanger in '89,

07:43.200 --> 07:45.040
and I know what's it's like.

07:45.120 --> 07:49.400
Life is full of possibilities.
Wild parties.

07:49.480 --> 07:52.400
But there's another side to the coin.

07:53.360 --> 07:54.560
I was introduced

07:54.640 --> 07:59.120
by the guys on the bus to something
we back then called "ganja."

08:00.680 --> 08:04.200
Fast forward to '97.

08:04.280 --> 08:07.960
There I am sitting by Oslo Central Station
selling my body

08:08.040 --> 08:11.520
to be able to afford the next shot.

08:11.600 --> 08:17.480
I was also caught with 20 grams of horse,
so I went straight to the slammer.

08:18.600 --> 08:19.960
Yes?

08:20.040 --> 08:21.800
I was just wondering,

08:21.880 --> 08:24.720
was he very nearsighted,
the guy who paid for your butt?

08:24.800 --> 08:26.840
[students laughing]

08:26.920 --> 08:32.360
Teddy is here in order to share his story,

08:32.440 --> 08:35.080
and I really do think
we should treat him with respect.

08:38.480 --> 08:40.640
There's something I want to ask you about.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.560
- Yeah?
- Did you put any extraneous items

08:42.640 --> 08:46.960
in the box of confiscated material
from the Americans' hotel room?

08:47.040 --> 08:48.920
Of course not. Why?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.320
This was in the box.

08:53.120 --> 08:56.680
- But this is Geir's.
- Yes.

08:56.760 --> 08:58.600
How did the Americans get hold of it?

08:58.680 --> 09:01.560
I've no idea, Laila. But...

09:01.640 --> 09:04.440
He was in New York when he...

09:06.480 --> 09:09.040
Oh, my God.

09:10.640 --> 09:15.480
You don't think the Americans might have
been involved in what happened to Geir?

09:17.680 --> 09:18.920
Shit.

09:20.800 --> 09:24.680
I didn't think the last  Sex and the City
movie was too bad myself.

09:24.760 --> 09:27.440
Oh, for Christ's sake!

09:27.520 --> 09:33.840
But it was quite funny, wasn't it,
when Carrie found Big in the closet?

09:35.640 --> 09:37.560
- Wasn't that funny?
- No.

09:39.040 --> 09:41.960
[in English]
Hiya, boys.

09:42.040 --> 09:46.360
I want you to say hello to my friend,
Indiana Jonas.

09:46.440 --> 09:50.280
Kid's got more class than all you lowlifes
put together. Look at that suit.

09:50.360 --> 09:53.920
[in Norwegian] Let me know
if you want some liquor in that cola.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.560
[in English]
Take it easy. He's 12 years old.

09:56.640 --> 09:58.040
So?

09:58.120 --> 10:01.240
[in Norwegian] I started drinking
when I was nine. Ain't done me no harm.

10:01.320 --> 10:04.800
[in English] No, no damage.
Except for the brain damage.

10:04.880 --> 10:06.600
[others laughing]

10:09.440 --> 10:11.320
[in English]
I got it, boss.

10:11.400 --> 10:15.000
[in Norwegian] Johnny, the policewoman is
here. She wants to talk to you.

10:18.640 --> 10:20.160
[in English] Deal the kid in.

10:20.240 --> 10:22.040
- Me?
- Yeah.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.880
Go ahead.

10:29.440 --> 10:31.680
[band playing hip-hop song]

10:34.600 --> 10:37.280
Take a break, gang. I have
a little meeting over here, all right?

10:38.920 --> 10:41.600
A little something for the kids.

10:41.680 --> 10:43.200
Can I get you a drink?

10:43.280 --> 10:45.160
[in Norwegian]
No, thank you.

10:45.240 --> 10:49.760
I don't know whether you heard
about what happened to my colleague, Geir.

10:51.240 --> 10:52.040
Yeah.

10:52.120 --> 10:55.360
He was doing some investigating
concerning you a bit.

10:55.440 --> 10:58.680
[in English] Maybe now that he's gone,
we can put that to rest, huh?

10:58.760 --> 11:01.920
[in Norwegian] Well, now we're looking
for two Americans

11:02.000 --> 11:06.280
who have been involved
in several incidents,

11:06.360 --> 11:10.240
and we've confiscated something from them
connecting them to Geir.

11:11.560 --> 11:12.960
[in English]
Two Americans, you say?

11:13.040 --> 11:14.080
[in Norwegian]
Yes.

11:14.160 --> 11:18.360
My theory is that you're the link
to the two Americans.

11:20.640 --> 11:24.280
[in English] Whoa. That's a bit
of a stretch, don't you think, Officer?

11:26.680 --> 11:30.520
[in Norwegian] I know you're hiding
something, Johnny. I just know.

11:32.560 --> 11:35.360
[in English]
Well, I can't help you.

11:37.160 --> 11:39.280
[in Norwegian]
Call me, then, Johnny.

11:49.960 --> 11:52.600
[Jan] Here's our dinner, girls!

11:53.720 --> 11:56.800
"Jan always catches us."

12:01.320 --> 12:03.760
Come on, let's make dinner.

12:06.600 --> 12:09.480
So, are we hungry?

12:09.560 --> 12:11.440
- Yes.
- Yes.

12:11.520 --> 12:14.280
- Didn't hear?
- Yes, already.

12:14.360 --> 12:17.000
- Can't we just start, Jan?
- Yes.

12:17.080 --> 12:19.040
Potatoes and...

12:19.120 --> 12:22.560
There you go. Just pass it round.

12:22.640 --> 12:25.160
- It looks good.
- Could you pass the fish, Jan?

12:25.240 --> 12:26.720
[Yusuf yelling]

12:28.360 --> 12:30.640
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

12:34.080 --> 12:36.960
What on Earth?
Are you a complete numbskull?

12:37.040 --> 12:41.080
I told you the lid must be down.

12:41.160 --> 12:43.000
Was that so fucking difficult
to understand?

12:43.080 --> 12:45.520
[speaking foreign language]

12:45.600 --> 12:46.600
[Norwegian]
Don't give me that...

12:46.680 --> 12:49.560
Don't give me that. Yusuf!

12:49.640 --> 12:51.280
Yusuf!

12:55.520 --> 12:57.360
Yusuf!

13:01.480 --> 13:03.040
Yusuf!

13:11.640 --> 13:13.760
[in English]
Pretty good here, huh?

13:13.840 --> 13:15.520
Wait a minute.

13:15.600 --> 13:19.520
How did you win that much dough
with this shit hand?

13:19.600 --> 13:21.320
Shit hand?

13:21.400 --> 13:24.800
[in Norwegian] You were bidding
like a savage. Were you bluffing me?

13:24.880 --> 13:27.800
[in English]
That's my boy! I tried to warn you.

13:29.200 --> 13:32.000
[in Norwegian]
You sneaky little devil.

13:32.080 --> 13:33.640
[in English]
No, no, no. Where you going?

13:33.720 --> 13:37.800
You just keep doing what you're doing.
You're doing great.

13:40.520 --> 13:43.080
I don't know how much you've heard
about our problem.

13:43.160 --> 13:46.040
[in Norwegian]
I heard it was something about Arne.

13:46.120 --> 13:47.840
Yeah.

13:47.920 --> 13:50.440
[in Norwegian]
No, you've gotta be kidding!

13:50.520 --> 13:52.840
You think I'm gonna fall for that again?

13:52.920 --> 13:56.400
If those swine are still in town,
then we'll find them. I promise you that.

13:56.480 --> 13:59.840
[in English]
Yeah. I was hoping you'd say that.

13:59.920 --> 14:03.760
You tell your guys,
they bring those motherfuckers here,

14:03.840 --> 14:06.160
- ten grand each.
- You got it.

14:06.240 --> 14:09.840
[in Norwegian]
I see you and raise by 500.

14:11.440 --> 14:13.440
- Okay.
- Yeah.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.000
- Then I see you...
- Okay.

14:15.080 --> 14:17.400
...and I'm going all in.

14:19.480 --> 14:22.160
Listen to this kid. "All in."

14:22.720 --> 14:25.040
Okay.

14:25.120 --> 14:29.080
I've got a diamond flush.
Chew on that now.

14:29.160 --> 14:33.360
But doesn't a full house
beat a flush, actually?

14:33.440 --> 14:34.640
Let me see.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.480
[laughing]

14:43.880 --> 14:46.040
[in English]
My boy! That's my boy!

14:46.120 --> 14:49.640
[in Norwegian]
But now you've done all you can, Jan.

14:49.720 --> 14:53.120
He'll probably show up soon.

14:53.200 --> 14:55.720

32:13.720 --> 32:17.480
[in Norwegian]
It's my mother. It's Mom!

32:17.560 --> 32:19.520
That's my mother, God damn it.

32:19.600 --> 32:22.920
[in English] All right,
take it easy, take it easy.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
I couldn't have known that.

32:25.080 --> 32:26.760
Never would have allowed it.

32:31.520 --> 32:33.360
Here you go.

32:33.440 --> 32:35.480
[in Norwegian]
Fuck this.

32:37.600 --> 32:39.400
[in English]
Sorry about that.

32:50.120 --> 32:53.640
You match the description of the guys

32:53.720 --> 32:57.360
who had a violent incident
at the gas station.

32:57.440 --> 32:59.080
Says who?

33:02.280 --> 33:04.520
Now, tell me,

33:04.600 --> 33:06.560
how did you meet my colleague,

33:06.640 --> 33:08.800
Geir Tvedt in New York?

33:10.640 --> 33:13.800
We got no idea what you're
talking about, all right?

33:13.880 --> 33:15.320
Ah. Hmm.

33:21.320 --> 33:23.040
We found...

33:26.600 --> 33:29.080
this in your hotel room.

33:31.760 --> 33:34.160
So fucking what?
I bought it on eBay.

33:34.240 --> 33:36.200
[chuckles]

33:38.840 --> 33:40.360
I have a strong feeling

33:40.440 --> 33:43.640
that you two know
what happened to my friend.

33:50.640 --> 33:52.400
Excuse me.

33:56.480 --> 33:58.920
[in Norwegian] You can't just keep them
here without a formal charge.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.560
Hans is trying to find the witnesses now,
but it is the National Day.

34:02.640 --> 34:06.640
Yes, their lawyer called me in
the middle of my breakfast. He's furious.

34:06.720 --> 34:09.640
This is a special situation, Arve.

34:09.720 --> 34:14.080
Very well, but I'm arranging
a sack race for the grandchildren,

34:14.160 --> 34:16.480
and don't have time to sit on
the telephone all day

34:16.600 --> 34:18.560
covering up your mistakes.

34:18.640 --> 34:19.920
Listen to me.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.880
I think they know something
about what happened to Geir.

34:27.360 --> 34:32.120
Have you taken leave of your senses?

34:32.200 --> 34:37.040
Geir got shot while he was buying drugs
in New York.

34:37.120 --> 34:39.840
These two are to be released now.

34:39.920 --> 34:42.200
At this station we adhere to protocol.

34:43.440 --> 34:45.360
[in English]
You are free to go.

34:54.320 --> 34:59.400
Hey, good luck finding the guys
who stole the Elvis-wannabe's fanny pack.

34:59.480 --> 35:01.240
Hey,

35:01.320 --> 35:04.800
how did you know
he was interested in Elvis?

35:08.240 --> 35:10.560
[screaming]
Answer my question!

35:10.640 --> 35:12.840
Get your fucking hands off me!

35:27.320 --> 35:29.320
[in Norwegian] Today we celebrate
the coming together of the Eidsvoll men

35:29.400 --> 35:31.960
in 1814 and their founding of
the society we are a part of today.

35:32.040 --> 35:34.640
A society that is one of the finest
in the whole world.

35:34.720 --> 35:36.800
[line ringing]

35:39.280 --> 35:41.800
Words like openness and tolerance
were important to the founding fathers.

35:41.880 --> 35:43.760
- [phone ringing]
- Turn that phone off.

35:43.840 --> 35:45.840
We are now a nation where many cultures

35:45.920 --> 35:49.800
live side by side, so this is
more and more important to remember.

35:49.880 --> 35:51.440
[phone ringing]

35:51.520 --> 35:55.760
Can't you shut off that phone?
You can't leave it on.

35:56.800 --> 35:58.760
[phone ringing]

36:02.240 --> 36:05.720
-  Torgeir.
- [speaking softly] Laila Hovland here.

36:05.800 --> 36:07.360
The police chief.

36:07.440 --> 36:09.480
Okay, and what's it about?

36:09.560 --> 36:12.320
I've been trying to get ahold
of your boss.

36:12.400 --> 36:15.200
The thing is that we've got
two Americans here

36:15.280 --> 36:18.320
whom I suspect you lot
would like to talk to.

36:18.400 --> 36:22.680
If we're suspected of something,
you need to talk to our lawyer.

36:22.760 --> 36:24.840
I can't help you at all there.

36:24.920 --> 36:25.760
Ow!

36:26.840 --> 36:28.680
It's not like that.

36:30.520 --> 36:33.200
I'm trying to warn you.

36:33.280 --> 36:36.680
They're being released now.

36:36.760 --> 36:40.200
But why do you want to help us?

36:41.600 --> 36:46.440
I don't like your boss,
but these two are worse.

36:47.880 --> 36:51.920
Just get a move on.
They're leaving as we speak.

36:56.160 --> 37:00.320
Did you really think you'd get away
with it? Huh? Huh?

37:00.400 --> 37:01.680
With what?

37:01.760 --> 37:03.000
With what?

37:03.080 --> 37:05.720
You don't do things like that to a pal
when he's laying flat out in the hospital.

37:05.800 --> 37:07.720
That was my mother!

37:07.800 --> 37:10.400
I really understand
how you're feeling.

37:10.480 --> 37:14.760
I've had a rotten conscience
about that thing.

37:14.840 --> 37:16.920
But, uh...

37:17.000 --> 37:18.560
older women have needs, too,

37:18.640 --> 37:21.560
and I'm just a man of flesh and blood.
I have my needs.

37:21.640 --> 37:23.480
One thing led to another--

37:23.560 --> 37:25.280
What are you on about?

37:26.160 --> 37:28.120
- Hmm?
- What are you talking about?

37:29.200 --> 37:30.480
What are you talking about?

37:30.600 --> 37:33.000
The picture, of course.

37:33.080 --> 37:36.600
Oh, yes, of course.

37:37.640 --> 37:39.720
What's with the picture?

37:39.800 --> 37:42.880
- Are you standin' there sayin'...
- Hmm?

37:42.960 --> 37:46.480
Are you standin' there sayin'
that you've screwed my mother?

37:47.640 --> 37:49.000
I'm not sayin' anything, am I?

37:50.680 --> 37:52.360
Defend yourself!

37:52.440 --> 37:54.560
[groans]

37:54.640 --> 37:55.920
Defend yourself!

37:56.000 --> 37:57.400
I don't fight injured people.

37:57.480 --> 37:59.200
[applause]

38:03.120 --> 38:05.560
Yes, tolerance is all very well,

38:05.640 --> 38:08.720
but we mustn't forget
that this is our National Day.

38:08.800 --> 38:11.560
And even though
we Norwegians have a big heart

38:11.640 --> 38:13.480
and let in many immigrants,

38:13.560 --> 38:15.680
we have to make sure
that these new immigrants

38:15.760 --> 38:20.400
offer something more to the country
than crime, poverty, ignorance,

38:20.480 --> 38:23.560
and a desire to suck up
the national wealth with straws.

38:23.640 --> 38:25.880
[in English]
Great speech, huh?

38:25.960 --> 38:28.680
[in Norwegian] On a day like this,
it's important to give a thought

38:28.760 --> 38:32.080
to those who fight for Norway
on a daily basis.

38:32.160 --> 38:36.560
I'm thinking of our allies
on the other side of the Atlantic.

38:36.640 --> 38:39.560
Without support from the USA,
we would be speaking German

38:39.640 --> 38:42.640
or be a province of the Soviet Union.

38:42.720 --> 38:46.720
Congratulations on this day
and God bless Norway!

39:02.520 --> 39:05.080
Defend yourself!

39:13.360 --> 39:14.880
Congratulations.

39:15.880 --> 39:17.960
Ow, ow, ow.

39:22.280 --> 39:25.880
Defend yourself!

39:26.920 --> 39:30.800
[in English] Hey, great speech, kid.
I'm proud of you.

39:31.680 --> 39:34.360
[in Norwegian] We're going to talk about
that speech when we get home.

39:34.440 --> 39:36.560
Johnny helped me with it.

39:36.640 --> 39:38.880
[in English]
Well, a little, you know.

39:40.400 --> 39:41.440
[in Norwegian]
Hey, Jan!

39:41.520 --> 39:44.000
- Hi.
- Hi, congratulations on the day.

39:44.080 --> 39:46.480
- Likewise.
- Sit down.

39:46.560 --> 39:49.520
- No, I'd better...
- Two minutes?

39:49.600 --> 39:50.640
Come.

39:51.920 --> 39:54.440
Yes. Yes?

39:56.400 --> 40:01.080
I was so curious about the bullet holes
you told me about.

40:05.480 --> 40:08.840
[in English] Yeah? You told me
that Johnny made them.

40:08.920 --> 40:11.880
Yeah, the moose hunt, remember?

40:13.080 --> 40:16.520
[in Norwegian]
Moose, isn't that in the fall?

40:16.600 --> 40:18.000
[in English]
Yeah, explain it to her.

40:18.080 --> 40:19.480
Yeah...

40:19.560 --> 40:23.520
[in Norwegian] Well, now,
I'm granted exemption rights

40:23.600 --> 40:26.720
on my own land, so then

40:26.800 --> 40:30.120
I invited Johnny along.
It was a really nice trip.

40:30.200 --> 40:31.200
Very nice.

40:31.280 --> 40:33.240
Oh, it was wonderful.

40:33.320 --> 40:35.200
[in Norwegian]
So those...

40:35.280 --> 40:38.160
Those bullet holes came from the hunt?

40:38.240 --> 40:40.920
Amusing story.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.280
We locked ourselves out,
so Johnny here...

40:44.560 --> 40:46.120
shot the lock up.

40:46.200 --> 40:47.680
[laughs]

40:53.040 --> 40:56.240
[in English] Really? I didn't know
that you were so good friends.

40:56.320 --> 40:58.320
Me and Jan?

40:59.600 --> 41:00.560
Best of buddies.

41:00.640 --> 41:02.920
Yes, you bet.

41:15.280 --> 41:19.160
You know, Jan,
you got a big fucking mouth.

41:19.240 --> 41:21.080
[chuckles nervously]

41:21.160 --> 41:23.520
I'm really sorry about that.

41:24.560 --> 41:26.120
But I got us out of it.

41:27.600 --> 41:30.680
Yeah, I'll give you that.

41:30.760 --> 41:34.000
[in Norwegian]
I've realized that you're a fellow

41:34.080 --> 41:37.520
it's okay to be on the same team with.

41:37.600 --> 41:41.160
[in English] Your attitude
definitely improved, I like that.

41:42.320 --> 41:44.280
You know what,

41:44.360 --> 41:47.400
- I've been doing some spring cleaning.
- Yeah?

41:47.480 --> 41:50.480
I don't think I'll be needing
these anymore.

42:04.200 --> 42:06.080
[in Norwegian] Thanks a lot.

42:06.160 --> 42:07.640
Thanks a lot.

42:07.720 --> 42:10.160
[in English] Easy now.

42:10.240 --> 42:14.080
[in Norwegian] Now I'm really feeling
that good National Day mood.

42:15.680 --> 42:18.760
[in English]
Good. Now wash your hands.

42:23.440 --> 42:25.400
[in Norwegian] Is there something wrong
with your telephone?

42:25.480 --> 42:28.840
I've called you a hundred times.

42:28.920 --> 42:31.800
[in English] I shut it off
during Jonas' speech. Why?

42:31.880 --> 42:34.160
It's a very short story.
But not now.

42:34.240 --> 42:37.880
The police called and said that
the Americans are to be released.

42:38.760 --> 42:40.800
Then what are you doing here?

42:40.880 --> 42:42.560
I don't know.

42:42.640 --> 42:43.960
Why aren't you following them?

42:44.040 --> 42:48.640
I was supposed to, but then Arne came
in and put my head into some porridge.

42:50.040 --> 42:52.880
Are you mentally unbalanced?

42:52.960 --> 42:55.560
We may not get this chance again.

42:55.640 --> 42:58.440
Yeah.
What am I supposed to do?

42:58.520 --> 42:59.920
Try and find them.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.440
And beef up security.

43:01.520 --> 43:03.320
Okay. Got it.

43:03.400 --> 43:05.600
Take care of that face.

43:07.840 --> 43:09.760
[mutters] What a moron.

43:11.600 --> 43:13.840
[Jan playing jaw harp]

43:26.480 --> 43:29.640
[Jan singing]

43:42.280 --> 43:46.840
[Jan in Norwegian]
Now I suggest a toast to our fantastic

43:46.920 --> 43:49.560
and generous host, Johnny.

43:49.640 --> 43:51.600
- [girls] Jerry!
- [Jan] Hey, listen.

43:51.680 --> 43:53.320
- [girls cheering]
- Cheers, Johnny!

43:53.400 --> 43:56.120
[cheering]

43:56.200 --> 43:57.480
[girl] Jerry!

43:57.560 --> 43:59.240
[Jan speaking in Norwegian]

43:59.320 --> 44:01.000
- [horn honks]
- [gunshot echoes]

44:03.600 --> 44:05.560
- Did you get him?
- I don't think so.

44:05.640 --> 44:07.240
God damn horn.

44:14.080 --> 44:15.920
[in Norwegian]
What was that loud bang?

44:16.000 --> 44:17.520
[in English]
Must have been a firecracker.

44:17.600 --> 44:21.280
- I think it is.
- I'll go check the front.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.840
[in English]
Come here, kid. Come on.

44:46.320 --> 44:48.640
It's time to make Tagliano come to us.

45:13.040 --> 45:14.760
Son of a bitch.

45:18.120 --> 45:20.920
[Cocktail Slippers'
