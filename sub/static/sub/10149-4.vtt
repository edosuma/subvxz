WEBVTT

01:43.896 --> 01:45.231
Stick 'em up.

02:12.091 --> 02:13.217
What'd I say?

02:39.368 --> 02:40.578
New schedule.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.580
This is where you get off.

03:06.812 --> 03:07.938
Check it out.

03:11.734 --> 03:12.734
Ah!

03:59.657 --> 04:01.200
<i>I'm guessing that's bad.</i>

04:01.283 --> 04:04.537
Cerestone. Only if you touch it,
taste it, or smell it.

04:06.872 --> 04:08.833
You want it so bad, Batman?

04:14.213 --> 04:15.589
We'll get the next batch.

04:42.658 --> 04:44.160
So what was that stuff?

04:44.243 --> 04:47.872
<i>Cerestone is an experimental
hormone that accelerates plant growth.</i>

04:48.247 --> 04:51.375
It could revolutionize farming
and make Wayne-Powers billions.

04:52.251 --> 04:55.087
A company called Agrichem
has been after the formula for years.

04:56.088 --> 04:59.758
The ringleader is named Karros.
High-tech robberies for hire.

04:59.842 --> 05:01.427
<i>He's been linked to Agrichem before.</i>

05:01.510 --> 05:02.636
Get away from me.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.972
Come on, baby,
I got lost time to make up for.

05:05.222 --> 05:06.640
- Get your paws off her.
- Hey!

05:06.724 --> 05:07.975
Let me go.

05:08.684 --> 05:10.144
Man, you picked the wrong booth.

05:10.227 --> 05:11.854
Big Time?

05:12.146 --> 05:13.522
T.T.!

05:17.485 --> 05:19.445
Big Time? T.T.?

05:20.863 --> 05:23.282
Guys, this is
Charlie "Big Time" Bigelow.

05:23.491 --> 05:25.719
Charlie was always scheming about
how he was gonna make it big,

05:25.743 --> 05:26.994
and the name stuck.

05:27.077 --> 05:31.081
And T.T. is Tiny Terry
'cause he was always thinking small.

05:31.457 --> 05:32.666
Dana, you remember Charlie?

05:32.750 --> 05:34.460
I remember who he is.

05:34.793 --> 05:36.086
Do you?

05:36.170 --> 05:38.589
Come on, twip.
What's good to eat around here?

05:38.672 --> 05:40.257
You gonna buy me a burger or what?

05:48.307 --> 05:50.309
- When'd you get out?
- A couple of days ago.

05:50.559 --> 05:51.799
I thought you'd be at the gate.

05:51.894 --> 05:53.729
Yeah. I, um...

05:54.438 --> 05:56.982
Stop sweating, McGinnis.
You're off the hook.

05:57.066 --> 05:58.275
Life goes on.

06:00.945 --> 06:02.530
Wanna make it up to me?

06:03.197 --> 06:04.782
Depends on what you have in mind.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.493
Made some contacts inside.
Big people.

06:07.576 --> 06:09.954
They got a job lined up for me.
I could use your help.

06:11.413 --> 06:13.040
I am so out of here.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.708
Whoa, whoa.

06:14.959 --> 06:16.293
I say something wrong?

06:16.377 --> 06:18.337
A job, Charlie?

06:18.420 --> 06:21.549
I have a life now.
School. A real job.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.592
And you just got out ofjail.

06:23.676 --> 06:25.970
You know how long they'll throw
you back for number two?

06:26.053 --> 06:27.697
Don't you want to do
anything with your life?

06:27.721 --> 06:29.723
Hey, ease up, Tiny.

06:29.807 --> 06:31.850
You only have that nice life
because of me.

06:31.934 --> 06:33.769
You owe me for playing your part down.

06:35.020 --> 06:37.147
Grow up, Charlie, for your own sake.

06:38.524 --> 06:39.524
Terry?

06:40.234 --> 06:41.610
Terry, wait up.

06:41.819 --> 06:43.821
You're right.
You don't wanna mess things up.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.114
You got a good thing going.

06:45.197 --> 06:47.533
You were the lucky one,
and I gotta face that.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.660
Hey, I'd love to go straight,

06:49.743 --> 06:51.912
but I don't have the same choices
that you do anymore.

06:51.996 --> 06:54.373
I got a record.
Who's gonna hire me?

06:57.293 --> 06:59.336
No. I can't risk it.

06:59.420 --> 07:00.921
'Cause he's an ex-con?

07:01.005 --> 07:03.382
You know about my record.
You trust me with all this.

07:03.465 --> 07:05.759
You didn't spend three years in prison.

07:05.843 --> 07:07.094
That's right.

07:07.177 --> 07:08.220
He did, and I didn't.

07:08.304 --> 07:10.264
All because
I happened to be underage.

07:10.556 --> 07:13.183
He and I were the same, Bruce,
only I caught a break.

07:13.350 --> 07:15.019
I just want to give him one too.

07:19.690 --> 07:20.858
Charlie, good news.

07:21.150 --> 07:22.627
I talked to Wayne,
and he pulled some strings

07:22.651 --> 07:24.695
at Wayne-Powers for ya.
Consider yourself hired.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.030
Excellent.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.740
<i>(Term
It's data entry, graveyard shift.</i>

07:27.906 --> 07:30.534
<i>Not exactly starting at the top,
but it'll get you on your feet.</i>

07:30.618 --> 07:32.411
Thanks, Tiny. You're all right.

07:33.579 --> 07:35.497
Now you know
I wasn't yanking ya.

07:35.748 --> 07:37.750
No, Charlie, you weren't.

07:41.295 --> 07:43.547
You sure you're ready
for the big time, kid?

07:44.965 --> 07:46.050
Are you kidding?

07:46.133 --> 07:48.344
Big Time's my middle name.

08:11.075 --> 08:13.452
- You belong here?
- Huh? Oh.

08:13.535 --> 08:15.579
Charlie Bigelow. First day.

08:16.914 --> 08:18.123
Listen, Mr...

08:18.207 --> 08:20.125
Excuse me, Captain Rubens.

08:20.209 --> 08:21.752
I'm not even on the job two hours,

08:21.835 --> 08:23.962
and I dropped a disk
behind the mainframe.

08:24.046 --> 08:26.674
Think you could help me push it aside?

08:26.757 --> 08:28.592
I'm history
if I don't finish the work on it.

08:29.385 --> 08:30.803
Yeah, all right.

08:30.886 --> 08:32.805
- Let's make it quick.
- Thanks, man.

08:38.227 --> 08:39.227
Got it.

08:43.065 --> 08:44.065
All set?

08:44.108 --> 08:46.527
Yeah, thanks.
You saved my butt.

09:10.342 --> 09:11.719
What are you doing?

09:12.803 --> 09:15.639
You had to check up on Charlie,
my word wasn't good enough?

09:15.723 --> 09:17.307
Just keeping my eyes open.

09:17.391 --> 09:18.851
You should do the same.

09:18.934 --> 09:21.645
He's my friend, Bruce.
He came to me for help.

09:21.729 --> 09:23.814
The question is, help for what?

09:23.897 --> 09:24.898
What does that mean?

09:24.982 --> 09:28.610
Your friend Charlie shared a cell
with a man named Richard Armacost.

09:28.694 --> 09:29.820
So?

09:29.903 --> 09:32.531
Armacost was serving time
for insider trading.

09:32.781 --> 09:35.492
He was and still is
a top executive at Agrichem.

09:38.203 --> 09:40.205
That's his big contact from inside.

09:43.125 --> 09:45.461
Did he know in prison
that you were working for me?

09:45.627 --> 09:46.920
Yeah.

09:47.004 --> 09:48.672
We e-mailed now and then.

09:57.639 --> 10:00.184
We made this glove from
the palm print you captured.

10:00.267 --> 10:03.103
Hey, Thumbelina. Take the glove.

10:03.187 --> 10:05.564
Richie, this guy
can talk to me like that?

10:05.689 --> 10:07.983
We just need to know
you're paying attention, Charlie.

10:08.066 --> 10:09.818
We wanna make sure everything's clear.

10:14.364 --> 10:16.575
A scanner will read the glove
as the guard's hand.

10:16.658 --> 10:19.953
Midnight tonight, you use it
to get into the Cerestone lab

10:20.037 --> 10:22.289
and open the east loading bay
from the inside.

10:22.372 --> 10:23.832
You got it?

10:23.916 --> 10:25.125
I got it.

10:29.087 --> 10:32.508
You ain't treating me right for
how I watched your back on the inside.

10:32.591 --> 10:33.926
You'd have been eaten alive.

10:34.009 --> 10:35.761
In prison, we were on your turf,

10:35.844 --> 10:37.638
and I deferred to your expertise.

10:37.721 --> 10:40.182
Right now, Mr. Karros is the expert.

10:40.265 --> 10:42.076
Now, part of proving
you're ready for this work

10:42.100 --> 10:44.019
will be showing him the proper respect.

10:56.490 --> 10:57.866
What are you doing here?

10:57.950 --> 10:59.618
That's just what I was gonna ask you.

11:01.370 --> 11:02.555
I know what you're up to, Charlie.

11:02.579 --> 11:04.873
You're gonna hit Wayne-Powers
for Agrichem.

11:04.957 --> 11:06.166
You used me.

11:06.250 --> 11:07.793
I tried to let you in on it, McGinnis.

11:07.876 --> 11:09.270
This is the break I've been looking for,

11:09.294 --> 11:11.314
and it could have been
our ticket to the big leagues.

11:11.338 --> 11:14.299
But no. You wanna be
a gopher the rest of your life.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.427
Three years,
and you haven't changed a bit.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.638
You're still a kid, Charlie,
looking for shortcuts.

11:21.306 --> 11:22.474
I can't let you do it.

11:24.685 --> 11:26.728
What, you're gonna stop me?

11:26.812 --> 11:28.689
What do you expect me to do,
back out?

11:28.772 --> 11:30.566
Not with the kind of people
I'm playing with.

11:31.984 --> 11:33.861
You were always thinking small, Terry.

11:33.944 --> 11:36.572
You could never see your way
out of that tiny, little box.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.675
You wouldn't know how to stop me,
even if you wanted to.

11:38.699 --> 11:40.325
You're the one who hasn't changed.

11:44.580 --> 11:46.748
Yeah, Charlie, I have.

12:02.472 --> 12:03.974
What are you...

12:38.550 --> 12:40.344
Off to a good start, kid.

12:40.636 --> 12:42.721
- Piece of cake.
- But don't relax now.

12:42.804 --> 12:44.556
In and out in two minutes.

12:47.434 --> 12:48.727
Get a hand truck.

12:48.894 --> 12:50.979
Or just walk away.

12:51.063 --> 12:53.440
I'm giving you all a rare chance
to skip what's coming.

12:54.483 --> 12:55.483
Pass.

13:00.030 --> 13:01.698
Get the cans on the truck.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.003
Let's go.

14:00.465 --> 14:01.591
Wait!

14:24.364 --> 14:26.158
It wasn't my fault.

14:26.241 --> 14:28.618
How was I supposed to know
Batman would show up?

14:29.369 --> 14:31.580
This whole deal
hinged on you, little man.

14:31.663 --> 14:33.248
The Charlie plan crashed.

14:33.331 --> 14:35.167
And that means it's Charlie's fault.

14:39.838 --> 14:41.298
You threatening me?

14:41.381 --> 14:43.467
Richie ain't gonna let you do nothing.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.761
He ain't the type
to get his hands dirty.

14:46.178 --> 14:47.971
You don't get it yet, kid.

14:48.055 --> 14:49.931
I don't care
what your pal Richie thinks.

14:50.015 --> 14:52.309
I stood to make
a lot of creds on this deal,

14:52.392 --> 14:54.561
and now I'm not gonna see
those creds.

14:54.644 --> 14:56.271
So they better come from you,

14:56.354 --> 14:58.565
or I'm gonna have to find some solace.

15:34.184 --> 15:36.269
Please don't get dragged down
by him again.

15:36.478 --> 15:38.980
Is somebody gonna tell me
what went on with these guys?

15:39.064 --> 15:40.190
Ask Terry.

15:42.025 --> 15:43.068
Terry.

15:43.944 --> 15:46.196
- Are you all right?
- I'm in a jam.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.948
Batman messed up the hit last night,

15:48.031 --> 15:50.200
and the guys I was working for
say it's my fault.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.337
They said I gotta come up
with 40,000 creds,

15:52.369 --> 15:53.745
or they're gonna skrag me.

15:53.829 --> 15:55.349
You gotta lift it off of Wayne for me.

15:55.872 --> 15:59.209
I can't do that, Charlie.
You need to turn yourself in.

15:59.584 --> 16:01.044
No. I'm not gonna...

16:01.128 --> 16:02.546
Charlie?

16:02.629 --> 16:04.005
Just stay away.

16:12.848 --> 16:14.683
Charlie was 18 and I was 14.

16:14.850 --> 16:18.812
My folks were breaking up,
and he and I were being angry kids,

16:18.895 --> 16:20.981
busting windows, shoplifting.

16:21.565 --> 16:23.859
Then Charlie decided to
prove himself to this big gang,

16:23.942 --> 16:26.153
and he dragged me along on a heist.

16:26.236 --> 16:28.798
I didn't even know what we were doing
till he was climbing in the window.

16:28.822 --> 16:30.323
But you went in too?

16:30.407 --> 16:32.033
Never said I was bright.

16:32.367 --> 16:34.178
Next thing I knew,
the cops were shouting, "Freeze,"

16:34.202 --> 16:35.871
and I was doing 90 days in juvie.

16:35.954 --> 16:37.873
That was a slap on the wrist
next to Charlie.

16:37.956 --> 16:39.916
He was in prison for three years.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.894
And that's why you've been
running around with guilt

16:41.918 --> 16:43.837
ever since he rolled into town.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.547
You don't owe him anything.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.591
He's my friend, Max.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.926
And he's gonna die
if I don't do something.

16:52.804 --> 16:54.764
You're not gonna bring him
to his senses.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.391
He needs to do that himself.

16:57.309 --> 16:59.603
Maybe I can at least
keep him alive until he does.

17:23.877 --> 17:26.671
You expect me to pay you
for lousing up?

17:27.005 --> 17:29.132
I've done two freebies
for you already,

17:29.216 --> 17:31.718
and I humored you
bringing along that nitwit.

17:31.801 --> 17:34.095
You'd have your chemicals now
if we did things my way.

17:36.973 --> 17:38.141
Thank you.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.559
No. Not here.

17:39.643 --> 17:40.852
What do you want?

17:40.936 --> 17:42.479
You just gave me what I want.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.165
When the police hear this,
you'll both be linked

17:44.189 --> 17:45.607
to the break-in at Wayne-Powers.

17:45.690 --> 17:46.983
That will never hold up.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.360
Maybe not.

17:48.443 --> 17:50.487
But it'll hold you for a day or so.

17:54.491 --> 17:55.700
Richie!

17:56.493 --> 17:58.370
- Charlie?
- The growth hormone.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.506
This is your fault, Richie.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.466
Look what you did to me.

18:11.549 --> 18:14.844
Now, Charlie, none of us
wanted this to happen to you.

18:15.470 --> 18:18.306
No! Charlie, don't!

18:18.390 --> 18:20.100
I protected you, Richie.

18:20.350 --> 18:22.018
You said you'd take care of me.

18:22.227 --> 18:25.480
Instead, you told that ant in there
that he could walk all over me.

18:25.563 --> 18:27.732
Charlie, please.

18:27.816 --> 18:29.359
Look down there, Richie.

18:29.484 --> 18:31.361
See how tiny all the people look?

18:31.444 --> 18:33.238
That's what you are to me now.

18:33.321 --> 18:34.364
You belong with them.

18:51.214 --> 18:52.214
Ha!

18:56.344 --> 18:57.387
Yah!

19:12.485 --> 19:14.237
Don't do this, Bigelow.

19:14.321 --> 19:15.905
I don't wanna fight you.

19:15.989 --> 19:17.615
Of course, you don't.

19:33.131 --> 19:37.052
At least now
I'm gonna get the respect I deserve.

20:00.950 --> 20:02.327
Oh, Charlie.

20:07.165 --> 20:09.167
<i>Having truly</i> earned his street name,

20:09.250 --> 20:12.379
<i>Charles "Big Time" Bigelow
is being held without bail</i>

20:12.462 --> 20:15.673
<i>while his partner Karros
has been moved to County General.</i>

20:15.757 --> 20:17.342
<i>In other news...</i>

20:17.425 --> 20:19.511
I knew something like this
was gonna happen.

20:20.178 --> 20:22.597
Aren't you glad you didn't get
mixed up with him this time?

20:22.889 --> 20:24.974
I mean, you'd only have
gotten yourself hurt.

20:25.058 --> 20:26.935
Yeah, lucky me.
