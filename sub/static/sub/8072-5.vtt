WEBVTT

00:08.242 --> 00:10.711
So do you want to
do something tonight?

00:10.744 --> 00:12.180
Uh, we're spending
the day together.

00:12.213 --> 00:13.013
That's enough.

00:16.050 --> 00:17.818
How about this weekend?

00:17.851 --> 00:18.719
I don't know.

00:18.752 --> 00:21.922
I'll let you know tomorrow.

00:21.955 --> 00:24.725
Darlene, we have to talk.

00:24.758 --> 00:26.394
Ever since we started
going out, it's

00:26.427 --> 00:29.197
like you have all the
power in this relationship

00:29.230 --> 00:30.030
and I have nothing.

00:32.300 --> 00:33.101
Yeah?

00:36.637 --> 00:37.438
OK.

00:40.441 --> 00:41.575
I need a soda.

00:41.609 --> 00:43.211
- Oh, there's only one left.
- Do you want ice?

00:48.816 --> 00:50.318
Hi, um, I'm Molly Tilden.

00:50.351 --> 00:52.586
My family just
moved in next door.

00:52.620 --> 00:56.490
And you're telling
me this because?

00:56.524 --> 00:59.127
My dad said the owner
gave you guys the keys.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.294
Oh yeah, they're
in the kitchen.

01:00.328 --> 01:01.862
Come on in.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.931
I'm Darlene.

01:03.964 --> 01:05.499
That's David.

01:05.533 --> 01:08.102
Every house should have one.

01:08.136 --> 01:09.603
Hi, I'm Molly.

01:09.637 --> 01:11.405
My dad just got
transferred from Iowa.

01:11.439 --> 01:12.840
We're renting the
house next door.

01:12.873 --> 01:15.109
Oh, well, the Connors
are a pretty cool family.

01:15.143 --> 01:17.145
I'm not one of them, but, uh.

01:17.178 --> 01:18.112
Hold on a minute.

01:18.146 --> 01:20.381
Your tag is out.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.583
Thanks.

01:22.616 --> 01:23.584
Here's your keys.

01:23.617 --> 01:24.718
Thanks.
OK.

01:24.752 --> 01:25.719
It was nice meeting you guys.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.555
Um, I'll see you around.

01:27.588 --> 01:28.756
Yeah, uh, I'll
see you at school.

01:32.660 --> 01:33.461
She seemed nice.

01:43.304 --> 01:44.272
Oh, hey, hold on a minute.

01:48.476 --> 01:49.343
Your tag's out.

01:55.416 --> 01:59.287
[theme song]

02:44.298 --> 02:45.766
Hey.

02:45.799 --> 02:47.968
Hi.

02:48.001 --> 02:51.939
So, did Fisherman dump you yet?

02:51.972 --> 02:55.243
No, but thanks for asking.

02:55.276 --> 02:56.977
Well I was just
checking because Dan

02:57.010 --> 02:59.747
met our new next door
neighbor and it turns out

02:59.780 --> 03:02.082
that he's like, a single dad.

03:02.115 --> 03:03.251
So?

03:03.284 --> 03:05.519
So, I was thinking,
you know, new guy in town

03:05.553 --> 03:06.420
and he's single.

03:06.454 --> 03:07.521
He don't know nothing about ya.

03:10.157 --> 03:13.261
Total sitting duck.

03:13.294 --> 03:17.498
And here I was nice
enough to bring you lunch.

03:17.531 --> 03:18.832
From where?

03:18.866 --> 03:19.833
Nowhere.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.436
Just a little
sandwich shop I know.

03:22.470 --> 03:24.238
Is it that loose
meat thing from Iowa?

03:24.272 --> 03:25.506
- Yeah.
- No!

03:25.539 --> 03:26.507
No.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.542
Roseanne, look, I
know it's a risk,

03:28.576 --> 03:31.512
but mom gave us both
$10,000 and I really think

03:31.545 --> 03:32.813
this business could take off.

03:32.846 --> 03:35.283
Yeah, or go right
down the tubes.

03:35.316 --> 03:37.818
I mean poverty is grand
but we've done that.

03:37.851 --> 03:38.786
Come on.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.187
Just taste it.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.322
What are you afraid of?

03:41.355 --> 03:42.823
That you're going to
love it and you're going

03:42.856 --> 03:44.124
to want to do this with me.

03:44.157 --> 03:45.693
No, I just don't want
to eat anything that's

03:45.726 --> 03:47.495
been fermenting
on your dashboard

03:47.528 --> 03:49.997
and your stinky
truck for five hours.

03:50.030 --> 03:50.898
I'm starving.

03:50.931 --> 03:51.765
Please feed me.

03:57.371 --> 03:58.272
Thank you, Jeannie.

04:01.809 --> 04:02.676
Oh that's terrific.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.144
What is that?

04:04.177 --> 04:06.980
Oh, just from a great little
restaurant I know in Iowa.

04:07.014 --> 04:08.048
Yeah?

04:08.081 --> 04:10.918
Could you go back and
get me some fries?

04:10.951 --> 04:11.819
OK.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.387
My birthday's on Friday.

04:13.421 --> 04:14.722
I'm turning 16.

04:14.755 --> 04:15.756
I'm getting my license.

04:15.789 --> 04:16.690
Can I have a car?

04:16.724 --> 04:17.625
No.

04:17.658 --> 04:19.927
Well, it was worth a shot.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.795
Way to commit, Darlene.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.597
How about getting
Becky's car running again?

04:23.631 --> 04:25.533
I mean it's just been sitting
in the driveway for months.

04:25.566 --> 04:26.534
I don't no.

04:26.567 --> 04:29.102
We'd have to kick
those gypsies out.

04:29.136 --> 04:31.439
The car's shot, Darlene.

04:31.472 --> 04:32.906
You could fix it.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.642
Yeah, Dan, you
could use those hours

04:34.675 --> 04:36.777
that you waste between
midnight and six just laying

04:36.810 --> 04:39.747
there in the bed unconscious.

04:39.780 --> 04:43.517
I'd take a shot but I
don't think it would work.

04:43.551 --> 04:47.588
So any more dreams we
can crash for you, Darlene?

04:47.621 --> 04:50.858
No, that'll just about do it.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.526
Happy birthday though.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.396
Man, her sweet 16, amazing.

04:55.429 --> 04:58.432
You know, you really ought to
do something special for her.

04:58.466 --> 05:02.235
You mean passing her big head
through my loins wasn't enough?

05:18.018 --> 05:19.953
What?

05:19.987 --> 05:22.055
Nothing.

05:22.089 --> 05:24.057
I know something you don't know.

05:24.091 --> 05:24.958
What?

05:24.992 --> 05:25.959
Nothing.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.695
Then get out.

05:27.728 --> 05:28.596
OK.

05:28.629 --> 05:31.765
But it's really good.

05:31.799 --> 05:33.000
What?

05:33.033 --> 05:34.435
Nothing.

05:34.468 --> 05:35.403
OK, that's it.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.104
Let me go.

05:37.137 --> 05:40.240
Don't make me shave
your eyebrows again.

05:40.273 --> 05:43.911
Mom's giving you a sweet
16 birthday party, OK?

05:43.944 --> 05:44.745
Oh my god.

05:49.316 --> 05:51.018
I she planning a
surprise party for me?

05:51.051 --> 05:52.386
Who?

05:52.420 --> 05:55.789
My psycho freak of a mother.

05:55.823 --> 05:57.090
I she planning to
throw me some sort

05:57.124 --> 05:58.792
of white trash debutante ball?

06:02.463 --> 06:04.532
Don't be silly.
A party for you?

06:04.565 --> 06:05.433
Please.

06:05.466 --> 06:06.333
Drop it.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.334
Rat boy already talked.

06:10.303 --> 06:13.306
Hair up would be nice.

06:13.340 --> 06:15.075
There's no way in hell
I'm going through with that.

06:15.108 --> 06:16.276
Cancel the clown.

06:16.309 --> 06:19.179
Whoa, whoa, hold it,
hold it, hold it, hold it.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.915
Look, I know how wrong
it is for someone

06:21.949 --> 06:24.084
like you who is so in
touch with a dark force

06:24.117 --> 06:26.253
to have a sweet 16.

06:26.286 --> 06:27.154
Thank you.

06:27.187 --> 06:28.255
But it's a party.

06:28.288 --> 06:29.389
Come on.

06:29.423 --> 06:32.325
Some cake, ice cream,
presents, a few friends.

06:32.359 --> 06:34.695
You invited my friends?

06:34.728 --> 06:36.296
Yeah, she seemed
like a very sweet girl.

06:39.967 --> 06:42.536
No, my life sucks enough
without this extra humiliation.

06:42.570 --> 06:43.904
Hey, in case you
haven't noticed,

06:43.937 --> 06:46.440
things haven't been exactly
great for anyone around here.

06:46.474 --> 06:48.375
This stupid party means
a lot to your mom.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.477
Why?

06:49.510 --> 06:50.444
I don't know, maybe
it give her something

06:50.478 --> 06:51.812
to look forward to.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.514
Maybe she doesn't how to tell
you she loves you any more.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.549
You scared the hell
out of us, Darlene.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.818
Yeah, likewise.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.787
Please, I consider
it a personal favor.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.321
I'd owe big time.

07:01.354 --> 07:02.556
How big?

07:02.590 --> 07:03.857
Real big.

07:03.891 --> 07:06.927
Like DJ needs a new lung
but Darlene's leather jacket

07:06.960 --> 07:07.761
comes first?

07:10.430 --> 07:13.901
OK, jacket before lung.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.737
I can't believe I'm
going through this.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.506
Well, maybe I'll
get lucky and choke

07:18.539 --> 07:20.007
on my free meal at Lenny's.

07:20.040 --> 07:27.114
Denny's

07:27.147 --> 07:28.616
16.

07:28.649 --> 07:31.552
Hard to believe how
fast they grow up.

07:31.585 --> 07:33.053
Yeah.

07:33.086 --> 07:35.856
Boy, it seems like just
yesterday I was teaching her

07:35.889 --> 07:38.125
how to hold her
little pinkie flat

07:38.158 --> 07:39.593
when she flipped people off.

07:42.395 --> 07:43.764
Remember when
we were 16 and we

07:43.797 --> 07:47.367
said we wanted to die before
we were 40 and we got old

07:47.400 --> 07:49.302
and gross?

07:49.336 --> 07:51.605
Yeah, I'd totally
forgotten about that.

07:51.639 --> 07:54.708
And here-- here
you are turning 40.

07:54.742 --> 07:57.044
Isn't it-- isn't that a riot?

07:59.513 --> 08:00.313
Yeah.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.186
Hey.

08:06.219 --> 08:07.655
- Hey.
- Is the coast clear?

08:07.688 --> 08:08.522
Yeah.
Yeah.

08:08.556 --> 08:10.223
Come in.
Did you get the camera.

08:10.257 --> 08:10.891
- Yep.
- Oh, good.

08:10.924 --> 08:13.360
OK.

08:13.393 --> 08:15.796
Uh, my mom's a little
funny about me taking it,

08:15.829 --> 08:17.998
but as long as you're
careful with it.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.567
Well, it's, you know,
not like I haven't

08:19.600 --> 08:22.002
had 100 cameras or anything.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.336
[doorbell]

08:23.370 --> 08:26.740
Jackie, would you get that?

08:26.774 --> 08:28.876
So, how do you get
the film in it?

08:28.909 --> 08:30.243
I'll load it.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.079
I'll load it.

08:32.112 --> 08:33.981
Roseanne, these girls just
moved into the Bowman house

08:34.014 --> 08:34.882
next door.

08:34.915 --> 08:35.883
Hi, um, I'm Molly.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.818
This is my older
sister, Charlotte.

08:37.851 --> 08:42.856
Hi, I'm Roseanne, this
is my older sister Jackie.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.625
Charlotte made
us some cookies.

08:44.658 --> 08:46.026
Us?

08:46.059 --> 08:47.127
Since when do you live here?

08:47.160 --> 08:48.528
Give me them.

08:48.562 --> 08:50.197
It's really nothing special.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.800
No, Charlotte, that
was so nice of you.

08:52.833 --> 08:55.703
You know, Roseanne, that
plate looks just like yours.

08:55.736 --> 08:58.906
Well, we found a whole
set in the dishwasher.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.340
Oh, yeah.

09:00.373 --> 09:04.344
I must of forgotten to
take that last load out.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.846
You guys moved in so damn fast.

09:10.517 --> 09:11.685
It's ready.

09:11.719 --> 09:13.053
OK, great.

09:13.086 --> 09:14.387
David, these are
our new neighbors.

09:14.421 --> 09:17.157
This is Molly and that's
Charlotte, edging her way

09:17.190 --> 09:18.291
out the door over there.

09:18.325 --> 09:19.492
Hey, David.

09:19.526 --> 09:20.694
You're here a lot.

09:20.728 --> 09:23.430
You too.

09:23.463 --> 09:25.298
You guys know each other?

09:25.332 --> 09:28.101
Yeah, we met before.

09:28.135 --> 09:29.637
Tag's in.

09:29.670 --> 09:30.470
Yeah.

09:33.473 --> 09:34.407
Darlene!

09:34.441 --> 09:36.810
Get down here now!

09:36.844 --> 09:37.778
Darlene's here?

09:37.811 --> 09:40.948
Is it OK if I go up and get her?

09:40.981 --> 09:43.316
You have met
Darlene haven't you?

09:43.350 --> 09:46.053
Yeah, she seemed nice.

09:46.086 --> 09:46.954
OK.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.421
Well, yeah, gone on up.

09:48.455 --> 09:50.223
It's second door on the right.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.392
And if I don't get to see you
again, thanks for the cookies.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.164
See you tonight.
Nice meeting you.

09:57.197 --> 09:57.998
Yeah.

10:07.474 --> 10:10.277
Oh, Charlotte.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.685
OK, Charlotte, that's
enough about you.

10:17.718 --> 10:21.254
Come on over here.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.390
Hey, uh, your
mom's calling you.

10:23.423 --> 10:25.893
Who's talking, please?

10:25.926 --> 10:29.162
It's me, Molly.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.598
Oh, right, the tag patrol.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.667
Do you always barge into
strange people's bathrooms

10:33.701 --> 10:34.668
without knocking?

10:34.702 --> 10:35.635
I'm sorry.

10:35.669 --> 10:37.070
I didn't think
it'd be a big deal.

10:37.104 --> 10:38.538
I just wanted you
to meet my sister.

10:38.571 --> 10:39.773
Oh, bring her up.

10:39.807 --> 10:40.674
Bring the whole family up.

10:40.708 --> 10:42.876
Got a dog?

10:42.910 --> 10:44.044
Hey, it's OK.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.645
You can just meet her later.

10:45.679 --> 10:49.116
I'll just hang her
and keep you company.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.583
So what are you doing?

10:50.617 --> 10:51.418
Interpretive dance.

10:54.221 --> 10:55.622
No, seriously.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.090
I'm dying my hair black.

10:57.124 --> 10:57.991
Really?

10:58.025 --> 10:59.426
Why?

10:59.459 --> 11:01.494
Well, my mom is throwing
me this really stupid party

11:01.528 --> 11:02.996
and I want to tick her off.

11:03.030 --> 11:06.166
Hey, you know, when I want
to make my dad really mad,

11:06.199 --> 11:08.736
I wear my bright red lipstick.

11:08.769 --> 11:11.671
You rebel.

11:11.705 --> 11:15.075
You know, maybe I
should dye my hair.

11:15.108 --> 11:18.111
This one time I thought about
doing something really drastic.

11:18.145 --> 11:22.049
I almost cut all my hair off
like Demi Moore in, "Ghost."

11:22.082 --> 11:23.717
You know what's
funny here, Molly?

11:23.751 --> 11:27.020
You keep talking to
me like I'm listening.

11:27.054 --> 11:29.456
OK, I can take a hint.

11:29.489 --> 11:33.426
You know, you come off
real sarcastic and all,

11:33.460 --> 11:35.729
but I got a feeling we're going
to become really good friends.

11:35.763 --> 11:36.563
Bye.

11:39.800 --> 11:40.633
Happy birthday, Darlene.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.507
Stop attending
there's no party, David.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.309
I knew about it two days ago.

11:49.342 --> 11:50.477
Darlene, there is no party.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.379
Now come on, we're
going to be late.

11:56.249 --> 11:58.118
OK, look, so they're
throwing you a stupid party.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.620
Come on, we're just
go in and laugh at it.

12:00.653 --> 12:02.589
All right, open the
door and shove me hard.

12:07.694 --> 12:10.163
Surprise!

12:10.197 --> 12:11.664
Surprise!

12:11.698 --> 12:19.006
We waited for, because
you're not a baby any more.

12:19.039 --> 12:23.811
Happy birthday to the
prettiest girl I've ever seen.

12:23.844 --> 12:26.313
Happy birthday, sweet 16.

12:30.617 --> 12:31.952
Oh, now, you
didn't think we'd let

12:31.985 --> 12:35.789
your 16th birthday go by without
a proper Connor celebration,

12:35.823 --> 12:38.091
did you?

12:38.125 --> 12:40.593
Oh, your hair.

12:40.627 --> 12:42.295
I love your hair.

12:42.329 --> 12:43.196
Oh, Darlene.

12:43.230 --> 12:45.032
She's all grown up.

12:45.065 --> 12:46.066
Oh, look at her.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.235
She's got a bosom.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.003
Hey, everybody get
with the birthday girl.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.474
Come on, get together.
Get together.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.576
Oh, make sure-- make
sure you get the button.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.511
Yeah, and make it
fast because the quicker

12:58.545 --> 13:02.682
we're done here the faster
we get to the dance contest!

13:02.715 --> 13:04.952
OK, one, two, three, cheese!

13:04.985 --> 13:07.020
Cheese!

13:07.054 --> 13:09.890
OK, now. just one
of the birthday girl.

13:09.923 --> 13:13.193
OK, uh, Darlene,
here, think fast.

13:13.226 --> 13:14.494
What are these for?

13:14.527 --> 13:15.728
Well, it's amazing.

13:15.762 --> 13:17.464
Becky's car seems to
be running fine now.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.867
And here, I think
this ought to be

13:19.900 --> 13:21.768
enough to buy you and your
fellow creatures of the night

13:21.801 --> 13:22.903
dinner and a movie.

13:22.936 --> 13:24.604
They're waiting for
you at the Pizza King.

13:24.637 --> 13:25.272
-
- Surprise!

13:25.305 --> 13:26.506
We want you to leave!

13:30.510 --> 13:31.378
Yes!

13:31.411 --> 13:32.445
It's just what I always wanted.

13:32.479 --> 13:33.847
Ho, oh.

13:33.881 --> 13:37.117
Well, I know my kid.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.318
So wait, you mean
this whole party

13:38.351 --> 13:39.619
thing was just a big joke?

13:39.652 --> 13:40.787
You put me through hell.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.590
Well, that was kind of for us.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.492
Maybe she just doesn't
know how to tell you

13:45.525 --> 13:47.127
she loves you any more.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.262
Sucker.

13:49.296 --> 13:50.931
Well, you're not gone yet?

13:50.964 --> 13:52.165
Leaving.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.400
Oh, Darlene.

13:53.433 --> 13:54.234
Yeah.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.771
I hate your hair.

13:58.805 --> 13:59.606
Thanks, Mommy.

14:07.881 --> 14:11.018
At my sweet 16, my mother
made us wear white gloves

14:11.051 --> 14:13.786
and eat this teeny sandwiches.

14:13.820 --> 14:15.288
Ew, it was so nauseating.

14:15.322 --> 14:17.190
Oh, mine was great.

14:17.224 --> 14:19.226
Me and my friends waited for
hours in the rain to see,

14:19.259 --> 14:22.495
"Three Dog Night."

14:22.529 --> 14:23.931
Oh, I remember mine.

14:23.964 --> 14:27.367
Uh, me and Dan went and got
really drunk and had sex.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.268
Oh.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.269
All right.

14:29.302 --> 14:30.971
That sounds like
a great birthday.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.205
Really.

14:32.239 --> 14:34.441
If I had known then how
many years I had ahead of me

14:34.474 --> 14:38.678
to get drunk and have sex with
Dan, I would of had the party.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.181
Remember how exciting
it was when we were 16

14:41.214 --> 14:42.916
and we had to sneak around
to be with our boyfriends?

14:42.950 --> 14:44.251
Remember that?

14:44.284 --> 14:46.219
Yeah, sometimes when me
and Dan are having sex,

14:46.253 --> 14:50.457
I'll call my mom up and tell
her I'm over at Debbie's.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.459
That's just so great then.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.827
He just doesn't have that
kind of passion anymore.

14:54.861 --> 14:55.862
Oh, come on.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.297
You and Arnie were
all over each other.

14:57.330 --> 14:58.498
Yeah.

14:58.531 --> 15:01.301
Yeah, we had mind-shattering
orgasms, but, uh,

15:01.334 --> 15:04.337
it was kind of lacking romance.

15:04.371 --> 15:05.172
You had orgasms?

15:09.509 --> 15:13.446
Yeah, but I was looking
for poetry and flowers.

15:13.480 --> 15:18.385
Instead I got limericks
and edible panties.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.653
The weird thing is, after
you've been with your husband

15:20.687 --> 15:22.689
for a while, I mean,
your priorities change.

15:22.722 --> 15:23.890
You know what I mean?

15:23.923 --> 15:26.693
Sex and romance, they're
not what they used to be.

15:26.726 --> 15:27.594
Excuse me.

15:27.627 --> 15:28.528
More punch.

15:28.561 --> 15:31.098
You know I am.

15:31.131 --> 15:32.532
Yeah.

15:32.565 --> 15:36.103
Yeah, I used to love it when Dan
could go all night, you know.

15:36.136 --> 15:39.839
Now I really love it
when he just sleeps.

15:39.872 --> 15:42.675
I got stuff to do.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.844
We sound like a bunch
of old married women.

15:44.877 --> 15:46.746
This is supposed to be a party.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.348
I think we should play a game.
- Oh yeah.

15:48.381 --> 15:49.249
Right.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.817
This is a sweet 16 party.

15:50.850 --> 15:53.286
How about we play true or dare?

15:53.320 --> 15:54.221
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:54.254 --> 15:55.322
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

15:55.355 --> 15:56.223
Who's going to be first?

15:56.256 --> 15:57.157
Me, me.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.058
Ask me first.

15:58.091 --> 16:00.027
OK.

16:00.060 --> 16:00.927
Truth or dare?

16:00.960 --> 16:02.562
I'll take truth.

16:02.595 --> 16:05.598
When was the last time you
were felt up at the movies?

16:05.632 --> 16:06.866
Ooh, that's a good one.

16:06.899 --> 16:07.767
It was last night.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.406
You went to the movies
by yourself last night.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.407
I did not!

16:14.441 --> 16:16.276
I did not!

16:16.309 --> 16:17.610
I went with Fisher.

16:17.644 --> 16:18.945
Oh.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.580
OK, you're through.
You're boring me.

16:20.613 --> 16:21.581
OK, my turn.

16:21.614 --> 16:22.949
OK, I'll take this one.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.651
I'll take this one.

16:24.684 --> 16:25.785
Truth or dare.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.020
Uh, truth.

16:27.054 --> 16:28.288
OK.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.957
Wouldn't you really like
to be partners with me

16:30.990 --> 16:33.093
and Nancy in our new restaurant?

16:33.126 --> 16:35.195
You and Nancy?

16:35.228 --> 16:36.896
Yeah, I'm going
into the business too.

16:36.929 --> 16:37.964
Isn't that wild?

16:37.997 --> 16:40.200
You guys are going
to do it without me?

16:40.233 --> 16:41.768
You said you
didn't want to do it.

16:41.801 --> 16:44.271
No I didn't!

16:44.304 --> 16:46.273
I said I couldn't do it.

16:46.306 --> 16:47.340
What's the difference?

16:47.374 --> 16:49.742
There's a huge
difference, Jackie.

16:49.776 --> 16:51.511
I don't want to do
it means you can

16:51.544 --> 16:52.645
go ahead and do it yourself.

16:52.679 --> 16:57.217
But I can't do it means
you can't do it either.

16:57.250 --> 17:00.387
So, you are interested?

17:00.420 --> 17:02.689
Truth?

17:02.722 --> 17:03.723
I'm taking dare.

17:03.756 --> 17:05.358
No, no, so you--
no, she took truth.

17:05.392 --> 17:06.259
Dare, double-dare.

17:06.293 --> 17:07.160
OK.

17:07.194 --> 17:08.061
OK, double-dare.

17:08.095 --> 17:09.196
OK.

17:09.229 --> 17:13.366
I double-dare you to go
out to the mud porch,

17:13.400 --> 17:16.035
take off your shirt, run
screaming through the backyard

17:16.069 --> 17:17.604
into the garage and flash Dan.

17:20.973 --> 17:23.076
Flash my husband of 19 years.

17:23.110 --> 17:24.177
It's so risque.

17:24.211 --> 17:25.545
- You gotta do it, Roseanne.
- That's right.

17:25.578 --> 17:26.579
I know.
I know.

17:26.613 --> 17:28.047
Come on, do it.

17:28.081 --> 17:29.482
Hey, shut up.

17:29.516 --> 17:33.986
God, next thing you're going
to dare me to have three kids.

17:34.020 --> 17:35.855
I know, why don't you dare
me to make a meatloaf?

17:35.888 --> 17:36.689
Ooh.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.128
I'm going.

17:41.161 --> 17:43.996
So damn stupid I
can't believe this.

17:44.030 --> 17:46.233
Oh, and, no bra.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.367
It's cold out here.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.569
Double-dare.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.037
I ought to beat you up later.

17:51.070 --> 17:51.871
Yeah.

17:58.010 --> 17:59.446
What form.

17:59.479 --> 18:02.415
Hey, let's lock her out.

18:02.449 --> 18:03.716
Wait a minute, here she comes.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.688
What's wrong?

18:08.721 --> 18:09.589
What?

18:09.622 --> 18:10.490
What?

18:10.523 --> 18:11.491
Oh my god.

18:11.524 --> 18:12.392
Oh my god.

18:12.425 --> 18:13.226
What?

18:15.595 --> 18:19.432
Rosie, I'd like you to meet
our new neighbor, Ty Tilden.

18:24.904 --> 18:28.741
Ty, this is my, Roseanne.

18:28.775 --> 18:32.679
Well, you uh, sure know how
to make a guy feel welcome.

18:41.554 --> 18:42.989
[laughing]

18:43.022 --> 18:44.924
It's not that funny.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.359
Yes it was.

18:46.393 --> 18:47.260
It was a classic.

18:51.764 --> 18:52.999
You're supposed
to say something

18:53.032 --> 18:54.434
to make me feel better.

18:54.467 --> 18:55.568
OK.

18:55.602 --> 18:57.136
Well I don't think Ty
got hit with anything.

18:59.772 --> 19:02.008
No, but you did.

19:02.041 --> 19:02.909
All right.

19:02.942 --> 19:04.477
I'll never mention it again.

19:04.511 --> 19:05.312
Good.

19:12.385 --> 19:13.286
Good night.

19:17.824 --> 19:18.691
Hey, Dan.

19:18.725 --> 19:19.526
Happy birthday.

19:23.196 --> 19:24.397
Huh?

19:24.431 --> 19:27.467
Well, you know this
idea that Jackie's

19:27.500 --> 19:30.069
got about this loose meat
sandwich place and everything?

19:30.102 --> 19:31.371
It's really stupid, isn't it?

19:31.404 --> 19:32.472
I don't know.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.441
It's sure a tough time
to open a business.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.309
Yeah.

19:36.343 --> 19:39.212
Yeah, you're right,
it is really stupid.

19:39.246 --> 19:40.112
OK.

19:40.146 --> 19:43.350
All right.

19:43.383 --> 19:44.884
Of course it would be
kind of cool to have

19:44.917 --> 19:45.785
something of my own.

19:45.818 --> 19:47.186
You know, I've never had that.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.255
What are you taking about?

19:48.288 --> 19:50.390
Everything that's mine is yours?

19:50.423 --> 19:54.193
Yeah, well your
stuff's no good.

19:54.227 --> 19:56.563
Ah, just forgot I
even brought it up.

19:56.596 --> 19:57.464
OK?

19:57.497 --> 19:58.398
Good night.

20:03.470 --> 20:05.572
Well, it's not that
crazy, you know?

20:05.605 --> 20:07.206
Are you kidding?

20:07.240 --> 20:09.876
After what we went through
with the bike shop?

20:09.909 --> 20:11.278
Yeah, but like
Jackie says, you

20:11.311 --> 20:14.314
know, this place, well, it's got
like a line around the block.

20:14.347 --> 20:16.283
And you loved the sandwich.

20:16.316 --> 20:17.684
So I'm just
thinking, when are we

20:17.717 --> 20:19.586
ever going to get another
chunk of money like this?

20:19.619 --> 20:22.589
And I just think,
you know, we spend it

20:22.622 --> 20:23.890
and we have nothing
to show for it

20:23.923 --> 20:26.393
except for some
stack of paid bills.

20:26.426 --> 20:27.827
We could learn to live
with that, Roseanne.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.899
Yeah.

20:32.932 --> 20:33.800
Listen to me.

20:33.833 --> 20:36.736
I sound just like Jackie.

20:36.769 --> 20:39.105
OK, I'm not bringing
it up again.

20:39.138 --> 20:39.939
Goodnight.

20:44.711 --> 20:46.178
Well you're right
about the money from Bev.

20:46.212 --> 20:48.881
It's only going to last so long.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.249
Well, yeah, but we
can make it stretch.

20:50.283 --> 20:51.651
Yeah, for seven
or eight months

20:51.684 --> 20:53.119
and we're right back
where we were before,

20:53.152 --> 20:54.854
living week to week.

20:54.887 --> 20:58.491
Well I don't know, shouldn't
the money go to DJ's college

20:58.525 --> 21:02.295
or towards Darlene's bail?

21:02.329 --> 21:04.964
It'll never last that long.

21:04.997 --> 21:08.535
If this business sticks then we
got a shot at something better.

21:08.568 --> 21:11.338
I don't know, Dan.

21:11.371 --> 21:14.807
Roseanne Conner,
loose meat queen.

21:17.677 --> 21:18.745
Sounds good.

21:18.778 --> 21:19.879
Yeah.

21:19.912 --> 21:20.713
Classy.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.117
Take this shot, honey.

21:25.151 --> 21:26.018
Oh, all right.

21:26.052 --> 21:28.120
If it means that much to you.

21:28.154 --> 21:30.323
I just want you to be happy.

21:30.357 --> 21:32.625
Thank you, dear.

21:32.659 --> 21:36.162
Of course you know if it
fails, I'm going to blame you.

21:36.195 --> 21:38.565
Wouldn't have
it any other way.
