Captioning made possible by
the Disney channel and the
U.S. department of education

00:26.309 --> 00:27.242
everyone in the world

00:27.277 --> 00:29.344
is different from everyone else.

00:29.379 --> 00:30.345
That's easy to see.

00:30.380 --> 00:31.480
Just look.

00:38.488 --> 00:40.055
But everyone is lucky enough

00:40.090 --> 00:41.590
to have one thing in common,

00:41.624 --> 00:44.393
one thing that binds
everyone together.

01:01.911 --> 01:03.545
Everyone has a heritage,

01:03.580 --> 01:04.780
a family history,

01:04.813 --> 01:07.816
traditions handed down
from grandparents

01:07.851 --> 01:08.784
and great-grandparents.

01:08.818 --> 01:12.755
Our next performer
is Kyle Johnson.

01:19.395 --> 01:20.562
Kyle.

01:22.265 --> 01:24.600
Hey, I'm down here!

01:24.634 --> 01:26.335
Kyle.

01:28.772 --> 01:30.072
Kyle.

01:30.106 --> 01:31.340
Kyle: But what if
I'm not that lucky?

01:31.374 --> 01:33.408
What if I'm the only person
who doesn't have a heritage?

01:33.443 --> 01:35.410
What if I'm... Different?

01:35.445 --> 01:37.346
I said I'm down here!

01:38.515 --> 01:40.415
Kyle: Can't you
see me?

01:40.450 --> 01:42.084
Kyle.

01:43.153 --> 01:44.253
Aah!

01:45.488 --> 01:46.455
Woman: Kyle.

01:46.489 --> 01:47.589
Huh!

01:49.759 --> 01:52.094
It's time to get
ready for the game.

01:54.497 --> 01:56.698
Go, eagles!

01:56.733 --> 01:58.534
I must have zonked out.

01:58.568 --> 01:59.802
I was having
this really
weird dream

01:59.836 --> 02:00.836
about this heritage day thingy

02:00.870 --> 02:01.870
that's going on at school.

02:01.905 --> 02:02.871
Pregame anxiety.

02:02.906 --> 02:03.839
Everybody gets it.

02:03.873 --> 02:05.240
I used to dream
i was at the game

02:05.275 --> 02:06.508
wearing nothing
but my underwear.

02:06.543 --> 02:09.377
And I was just in the band.

02:12.916 --> 02:14.183
You'll do fine, Kyle.

02:14.217 --> 02:15.417
You always do.

02:15.451 --> 02:17.419
Here, have some yogurt
and a fruit bar.

02:17.453 --> 02:18.487
It'll help you
keep your energy up.

02:18.521 --> 02:19.454
That sounds good.

02:19.489 --> 02:21.390
I might have some
of that myself.

02:22.725 --> 02:24.126
Where's our family from, dad?

02:27.730 --> 02:29.131
We're from right here, son.

02:29.165 --> 02:31.934
No. No, I mean,
where do we come from?

02:31.968 --> 02:33.836
You know, what's our heritage?

02:35.538 --> 02:37.139
We moved here from Cleveland.

02:37.173 --> 02:38.607
We're Americans, Kyle.

02:38.641 --> 02:39.921
That's all the heritage we need.

02:41.945 --> 02:43.011
Hey, come on, Kyle.
You're gonna be late

02:43.046 --> 02:44.112
for the game.
Let's go.

02:44.147 --> 02:45.981
Don't forget to wear
your lucky coin.

02:52.722 --> 02:54.790
I had this really weird feeling.

02:54.824 --> 02:56.744
Like there was something
they weren't telling me.

02:59.562 --> 03:01.530
This was the first time
our school had ever

03:01.564 --> 03:04.266
made it to the state
basketball playoffs.

03:08.805 --> 03:10.906
Get over, Russell.
Find your shot.

03:10.940 --> 03:12.641
Tonight was the quarter finals,

03:12.675 --> 03:14.543
and we were goin'
all the way this year.

03:14.577 --> 03:16.111
State champions.

03:28.458 --> 03:31.226
And I was the reason why.

03:41.170 --> 03:43.171
Everything was goin' my way.

03:46.776 --> 03:48.577
I was one lucky guy.

03:49.846 --> 03:51.947
Girls:
There's Kyle!

03:51.981 --> 03:53.548
Boy:
There he is!

03:53.583 --> 03:55.417
Girl:
Great, Kyle!

04:03.426 --> 04:04.526
Gee, that was a lucky shot.

04:04.560 --> 04:06.194
Hey, luck's got
nothin' to do with it.

04:18.308 --> 04:19.440
Lookin' good, Kyle.

04:21.209 --> 04:23.478
Yeah, I taught him
everything he knows.

04:36.292 --> 04:37.459
Hey, Kyle.

04:37.493 --> 04:38.794
Oh, hi, Bonnie.

04:38.828 --> 04:39.795
You know I'm in charge of

04:39.829 --> 04:41.163
the heritage day committee.

04:42.332 --> 04:44.199
You're in charge of,
like, every committee.

04:45.335 --> 04:47.536
I mean, somebody's gotta do it.

04:49.005 --> 04:50.372
I'm putting together
the program,

04:50.406 --> 04:52.641
and I wanted to know
what you're going to
do for heritage day.

04:52.675 --> 04:53.742
I don't know.

04:53.776 --> 04:55.610
I mean, you know,
this whole heritage day thing.

04:55.645 --> 04:57.112
It's like so public television.

04:57.146 --> 04:58.113
It's your history.

04:58.147 --> 04:59.414
Yeah, but I mean, history.

04:59.449 --> 05:01.149
You know, it's like
so 10 minutes ago.

05:01.184 --> 05:02.884
Now, sports. That's
what's happenin' now.

05:02.919 --> 05:04.186
That's where I'm comin' from.

05:04.220 --> 05:05.320
That's right.

05:05.355 --> 05:08.123
Well, even if you
are some kind of
mindless jock,

05:08.157 --> 05:09.658
you still got a heritage.

05:11.828 --> 05:12.828
Mindless?

05:12.862 --> 05:14.896
America is a nation
of immigrants, Kyle.

05:14.931 --> 05:17.466
Everybody's
ancestors came from
another country.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.634
Yeah. I'm
part cherokee.

05:21.270 --> 05:22.237
So, where's your family from?

05:22.271 --> 05:23.438
Is Johnson an English name,

05:23.473 --> 05:25.807
or did they change
it from johannsen,
or something?

05:26.709 --> 05:28.977
Uh, we're from Cleveland.

05:29.012 --> 05:30.112
Ha ha. Very funny.

05:30.146 --> 05:31.513
Now, come on. You
know what I mean.

05:32.515 --> 05:33.915
Look, uh, I've got a test.

05:33.950 --> 05:35.450
Ok. See you
guys later.

05:37.954 --> 05:40.989
Uhh... Jocks.

05:56.205 --> 05:57.139
Time's up, people.

05:57.173 --> 05:58.707
Put your test papers on my desk

05:58.741 --> 06:00.375
on your way out, please.

06:00.410 --> 06:02.177
Thank you.

06:07.016 --> 06:09.151
You'd be better off
leavin' 'em
blank, Kyle.

06:09.185 --> 06:11.620
Remember,
i subtract points
for wrong answers.

06:11.654 --> 06:12.788
Summer school.

06:13.956 --> 06:15.724
I do it specifically
to discourage

06:15.758 --> 06:16.825
what you just did...

06:16.859 --> 06:18.827
Guessing at the answers.

06:18.861 --> 06:19.928
You know, in real life,

06:19.962 --> 06:20.929
you can't depend on luck

06:20.963 --> 06:22.697
to make up for not knowing.

06:29.972 --> 06:33.742
These answers are all correct.

06:49.025 --> 06:50.992
Oh, this looks great.

06:51.027 --> 06:52.394
Thanks.

06:56.466 --> 06:58.900
So, is this like
Italian food or
something?

06:58.935 --> 07:02.537
It's something I saw
in <i> eat smart</i> magazine.

07:04.607 --> 07:05.740
Why?

07:05.775 --> 07:06.975
Oh, I just thought, you know...

07:07.009 --> 07:08.944
Maybe it was, like,
an old family recipe.

07:11.747 --> 07:14.316
You're lucky your mom
makes you such healthy
meals, Kyle.

07:14.350 --> 07:16.184
It's probably why you're
such a good athlete.

07:16.219 --> 07:19.921
Kyle just has
a natural talent
for sports.

07:19.956 --> 07:22.224
Yeah, you know,
it's probably
genetic.

07:22.258 --> 07:23.592
I mean, I bet,
if you go back
far enough,

07:23.626 --> 07:24.893
we've had great athletes

07:24.927 --> 07:26.461
in our family for generations.

07:27.997 --> 07:30.132
You know, great
soccer players, maybe?

07:31.701 --> 07:33.902
Or, uh,
cross-country skiers?

07:35.705 --> 07:36.805
Or...

07:38.474 --> 07:40.308
Bullfighters?

07:41.677 --> 07:42.717
You better eat your salad.

07:42.745 --> 07:44.446
You don't want
the oil to separate.

07:46.182 --> 07:48.283
Uh... Yeah, dad.

07:48.317 --> 07:49.251
Yeah.

07:49.285 --> 07:50.485
Um, I was talking with the girl

07:50.520 --> 07:51.786
in charge of
the heritage day
committee...

07:51.821 --> 07:52.821
Kate: Is it
Bonnie Lopez?

07:52.855 --> 07:54.823
She's always
in charge of everything.

07:54.857 --> 07:56.491
I know.

07:56.526 --> 07:58.226
Yeah. Anyways,

07:58.261 --> 07:59.828
she says that everyone's family

07:59.862 --> 08:01.229
comes from somewhere else.

08:03.566 --> 08:04.699
I mean, if you go
back far enough,

08:04.734 --> 08:06.401
we couldn't have
always lived
in Cleveland.

08:09.238 --> 08:11.106
Unless we're Indians.

08:12.775 --> 08:13.808
But...

08:13.843 --> 08:15.944
We're not Indians, are we?

08:16.812 --> 08:18.346
I don't think so.

08:20.116 --> 08:21.650
Ok, then what are we?

08:21.684 --> 08:22.964
You know, where do we come from?

08:24.620 --> 08:27.556
I think your great-grandfather
moved there from mount buffalo.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.524
No, dad. I mean
before that,

08:29.559 --> 08:30.992
before we came to America.

08:31.027 --> 08:33.861
Why are you so interested
in your family
all of a sudden?

08:33.895 --> 08:35.462
I don't know.
I mean, you know,

08:35.498 --> 08:36.631
with heritage day coming up,

08:36.666 --> 08:37.933
I don't want to be the only kid

08:37.967 --> 08:39.333
who doesn't know what he is.

08:39.368 --> 08:41.269
You're Kyle Johnson.

08:41.304 --> 08:42.703
You're a good student,

08:42.738 --> 08:43.804
a good boy,

08:43.839 --> 08:45.307
a great athlete.

08:45.341 --> 08:47.008
Just because some
people are obsessed

08:47.043 --> 08:48.483
with where their ancestors
came from,

08:48.511 --> 08:50.245
doesn't mean
you have to be, too.

08:50.279 --> 08:51.346
Mom, I'm not obsessed.

08:51.380 --> 08:52.314
Being an individual

08:52.348 --> 08:54.549
is what America's
all about, Kyle.

08:54.584 --> 08:55.684
Doesn't matter
where you're from.

08:55.718 --> 08:58.420
You can be anything
you want to be.

08:58.454 --> 09:00.822
Kate: Fresh ground pepper?

09:03.159 --> 09:04.893
Kyle: There it was again...

09:04.927 --> 09:07.896
The feeling that they were
hiding something from me.

09:07.930 --> 09:08.964
At school the next day,

09:08.998 --> 09:11.833
I tried to find out what it was.

09:32.521 --> 09:34.055
If you're looking
for sports trivia,

09:34.090 --> 09:35.991
try gofindalife.Com.

09:36.025 --> 09:38.393
Actually, I'm looking for
information on my family.

09:38.427 --> 09:39.828
You know, my heritage.

09:41.330 --> 09:42.631
Man, there sure are a lot
of people named Johnson.

09:42.665 --> 09:44.733
Yeah, 4 million pages.

09:44.767 --> 09:46.801
Maybe you should
narrow that search
down a little.

09:46.836 --> 09:47.936
Uh, why don't you start
with your father

09:47.970 --> 09:49.004
and trace your family
back that way?

09:49.038 --> 09:50.005
Well, I tried that,

09:50.039 --> 09:50.972
but I couldn't find him.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.507
Did you look in Cleveland?

09:52.541 --> 09:53.708
Huh.

09:53.743 --> 09:54.909
Here, move over.
Let me try.

09:54.944 --> 09:56.311
Look, you don't have to help me.

09:56.345 --> 09:58.880
I'm head of
the heritage day
committee, remember?

09:58.914 --> 10:01.583
It's my job to help
the heritage-impaired.

10:01.617 --> 10:03.852
It's not important to me anyway.

10:03.886 --> 10:05.120
I mean, so what
if I'm from Germany

10:05.154 --> 10:07.022
or england or whatever.

10:07.056 --> 10:08.657
Doesn't mean anything to me.

10:08.691 --> 10:10.759
Then why were you
on the computer?

10:12.194 --> 10:13.928
Ok, what about your
mother's family?
Where are they from?

10:13.963 --> 10:15.130
I don't know.

10:15.164 --> 10:17.666
Well, half of your heritage
comes from her, you know.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.034
Well, yeah, but...

10:19.068 --> 10:21.569
I never really
thought about
my mom's family.

10:21.604 --> 10:23.644
Well, what was her last name
before she got married?

10:25.775 --> 10:26.808
Don't tell me.

10:26.842 --> 10:29.210
You don't even know
your mother's maiden name.

10:29.245 --> 10:30.912
How are you ever gonna
get a credit card?

10:32.281 --> 10:34.182
Look, if you really
want to find out

10:34.216 --> 10:35.256
about your family heritage,

10:35.284 --> 10:36.484
you might try talking
to your parents.

10:36.519 --> 10:38.420
They <i> are</i> your family.

10:45.328 --> 10:46.561
I couldn't tell Bonnie
that I thought

10:46.595 --> 10:48.663
my mom and dad were
hiding something from me.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.067
That day, after school...

10:52.101 --> 10:53.735
It got weirder.

11:04.347 --> 11:05.280
The first weird thing

11:05.314 --> 11:07.949
was my dad's old
high school yearbook.

11:09.518 --> 11:12.320
He wasn't in it.

11:12.355 --> 11:16.624
At least, Bob Johnson
wasn't in it.

11:24.700 --> 11:26.801
Robert Smith.

11:34.076 --> 11:35.510
Bob Smith.

11:35.544 --> 11:37.112
Kate: Kyle.

11:42.318 --> 11:43.818
Oh, hi, mom.

11:44.854 --> 11:45.954
What are you doin'?

11:46.856 --> 11:47.956
Nothing.

11:49.692 --> 11:52.761
Um... I'm gonna
go shoot some hoops.

11:53.629 --> 11:54.596
Ok.
Ok.

11:54.630 --> 11:55.630
Don't be late for supper.

11:55.664 --> 11:57.232
I'm making stir-fry.

12:12.448 --> 12:13.748
Why would he change his name

12:13.783 --> 12:14.916
from Smith to Johnson, you know?

12:14.950 --> 12:16.084
I mean, if you're gonna
change your name,

12:16.118 --> 12:18.286
at least change it
to something
interesting.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.387
Or, you know what?

12:19.422 --> 12:20.789
Maybe he didn't pick it.

12:20.823 --> 12:23.358
Maybe it was the FBI
or something,

12:23.392 --> 12:24.926
like they gave him
a new identity.

12:30.900 --> 12:32.233
No, man.
You gotta be, like,
a hit man or something

12:32.268 --> 12:33.968
before they'll let you do that.

12:36.105 --> 12:37.372
Nah.

12:41.710 --> 12:44.379
Man, how do you
make those shots?

12:44.413 --> 12:47.215
You know what? Maybe
they were, like,
these big radicals

12:47.249 --> 12:48.216
in the sixties, you know?

12:48.250 --> 12:50.018
And they had to go underground?

12:50.052 --> 12:52.454
Yeah, or you know
what? Maybe they're
really aliens,

12:52.488 --> 12:53.588
and they got stranded on earth

12:53.622 --> 12:55.290
when their spaceship crashed.

12:58.294 --> 13:01.162
You just touched the rim.

13:01.197 --> 13:03.264
Yeah, I did. Ha.

13:04.366 --> 13:05.967
My dad measures me,
like, every week

13:06.001 --> 13:07.402
to see if I'm getting taller.

13:07.436 --> 13:08.970
Then he measures
my vertical jump.

13:09.004 --> 13:10.705
Man, if I could touch the rim...

13:10.739 --> 13:12.073
Man, you sure are lucky.

13:12.107 --> 13:13.174
What does luck have to do

13:13.209 --> 13:14.742
with how high you can jump?

13:14.777 --> 13:16.411
You're the luckiest guy
in school, Kyle.

13:16.445 --> 13:17.445
Everybody knows it.

13:17.480 --> 13:18.847
You know what?
I think it's

13:18.881 --> 13:20.515
because of that lucky charm.

13:20.549 --> 13:21.983
Maybe it really works.

13:22.017 --> 13:23.585
What, this?

13:23.619 --> 13:24.619
Nah, this is just
something my mom gave me

13:24.653 --> 13:26.554
when I was a baby.

13:26.589 --> 13:29.390
Hey, check it out!
Somebody lost $10!

13:29.425 --> 13:30.525
Luck and a half, man.

13:30.559 --> 13:32.594
You're always finding
money lying in the street.

13:32.628 --> 13:33.928
Hey, we're a team, all right?

13:33.963 --> 13:34.963
I'll split it with you.

13:34.997 --> 13:36.130
Cool.

13:37.800 --> 13:39.734
Hey, man, check it out.

13:41.170 --> 13:42.203
Hey, you know what?

13:42.238 --> 13:44.606
I saw that guy on TV once.

13:44.640 --> 13:46.174
No, no, no.
The thing
behind him.

13:46.208 --> 13:48.776
It's the same as my coin.

13:51.580 --> 13:53.214
I thought it was, like,
Chinese or something.

13:53.249 --> 13:55.283
Hey, you know what?
I think this guy's Irish.

13:56.452 --> 13:58.386
Maybe my mom's Irish.

14:14.770 --> 14:17.071
Man: Top o' the morning
to you, heh heh.

14:17.106 --> 14:19.908
Top o' the morning to you.

14:19.942 --> 14:23.278
Heh heh. Top o' the morning
to you, heh heh.

14:23.312 --> 14:24.746
Hi.

14:35.591 --> 14:36.991
Yo, the feet are the bomb,

14:37.026 --> 14:38.326
but, like, what's with the arms?

14:38.360 --> 14:40.562
It's something
called step dancing.

14:44.800 --> 14:45.767
Now, why wouldn't your mother

14:45.801 --> 14:47.535
want you to know
if she was Irish?

14:47.570 --> 14:49.037
I don't know.

14:49.071 --> 14:51.439
I just get this
really weird feeling
whenever I talk to her.

14:51.473 --> 14:52.840
I mean, it's like they
don't want me to know

14:52.875 --> 14:54.175
anything about my heritage.

14:54.209 --> 14:56.911
I didn't know you
really cared about
this heritage stuff.

14:56.946 --> 14:58.379
Well, I don't.

14:58.414 --> 15:01.683
I mean, I didn't, anyway.

15:01.717 --> 15:05.053
Now I feel like
I'm missing something.

15:05.087 --> 15:06.654
Yeah.

15:06.689 --> 15:08.122
Top o' the morning to you.

15:08.157 --> 15:10.992
Ah, sweetie, top o'
the morning to you.

15:18.667 --> 15:21.002
Ha. Maybe I should
read this.

15:21.036 --> 15:22.270
Look.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.908
Heh, they have these
good luck thingies
like yours.

15:26.942 --> 15:29.377
Those are just, you know, fake.

15:29.411 --> 15:30.411
Mine's real gold.

15:30.446 --> 15:32.246
Right.

15:32.281 --> 15:35.917
You can always tell
the real thing.

15:35.951 --> 15:37.585
Yeah, I guess so.

15:40.689 --> 15:42.023
Did you make those yourself,

15:42.057 --> 15:44.759
or is it your ma
still does it
for you,

15:44.793 --> 15:46.394
and you half-grown?

15:46.428 --> 15:47.929
You mean, my shoes?

15:47.963 --> 15:51.366
They're called
basketball shoes, sir.

15:53.102 --> 15:55.637
Yeah, you buy them at a store?

15:55.671 --> 15:58.373
At the store,
is it? Oh.

15:58.407 --> 16:00.241
Kyle: Yeah. Ow!

16:00.275 --> 16:01.476
And what'll become of your feet

16:01.510 --> 16:04.045
when the road
becomes hard
and stony?

16:04.079 --> 16:06.214
Oh, look at this, boyo.

16:06.248 --> 16:09.717
Good Irish leather, eh?

16:09.752 --> 16:11.753
Soft as a spring shower

16:11.787 --> 16:14.422
and tough as a landlord's heart.

16:15.958 --> 16:18.826
Hey! You can't put
your feet up there.

16:21.630 --> 16:24.098
Get the boys a bag of spuds.

16:29.772 --> 16:31.806
Hey, how'd you do...

16:31.840 --> 16:33.107
Russell:
Where'd he go?

16:33.142 --> 16:34.475
Where'd he go?

16:41.684 --> 16:43.551
Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen,

16:43.585 --> 16:47.922
Seamus mctiernan,
Saint of the step!

16:49.558 --> 16:53.695
If you
hail from the shores
of the emerald isle

16:53.729 --> 16:55.930
or wish you did...

16:55.964 --> 17:00.234
If the blood in your veins
is as green as a shamrock

17:00.269 --> 17:02.537
and your heart's
full of blarney,

17:02.571 --> 17:05.740
then the Saint
of the step loves you.

17:05.773 --> 17:08.242
If you believe
in the little people

17:08.277 --> 17:11.311
and you know that
there's a pot o' gold

17:11.346 --> 17:13.681
at the end of every rainbow,

17:13.715 --> 17:17.518
then you belong
to the Saint
of the step!

18:06.502 --> 18:10.338
Man, is this bogus or what?

18:10.372 --> 18:11.906
Kyle?

18:11.940 --> 18:14.208
Kyle?

18:16.178 --> 18:17.879
Kyle, what are you doing?

18:17.913 --> 18:20.281
I don't know!
I can't help it.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.381
Sorry, kid.

18:53.415 --> 18:55.850
Heh heh heh.

18:57.719 --> 19:00.087
Top o' the morning to you.

19:39.695 --> 19:41.896
Ow! Uhh!

19:49.671 --> 19:51.439
Ah! Top o'
the morning to you!

19:51.473 --> 19:54.542
Did you do something
to your hair, mom?

19:54.576 --> 19:57.345
I just thought I'd try
a more natural look.

19:57.379 --> 19:58.512
Now, sit yourself down,

19:58.547 --> 20:00.281
and I'll put
your breakfast
on the table.

20:02.951 --> 20:04.585
Is that bacon i smell?

20:04.620 --> 20:07.889
It is, and I've
a pair of hen's eggs
frying for each of you.

20:07.923 --> 20:08.956
Bob: Bacon and eggs?

20:08.991 --> 20:10.925
Isn't that a little heavy
on the cholesterol?

20:10.959 --> 20:13.160
Kate: It's time you put
some meat on your bones.

20:13.195 --> 20:14.896
Now, sit down, the two of you.

20:14.930 --> 20:18.099
Does ma sound a...

20:18.133 --> 20:21.702
I mean, does mom
sound a wee bit...

20:21.737 --> 20:23.771
I just said, "a wee bit."

20:23.805 --> 20:25.940
Yeah.

20:27.175 --> 20:29.210
I've been thinking about
what you said, Kyle,

20:29.244 --> 20:30.645
about your heritage,

20:30.679 --> 20:32.313
and there's something
i have to tell you.

20:32.347 --> 20:34.315
Uh, Kate, are you sure
this is the right time?
I mean...

20:34.349 --> 20:36.217
Oh, it's no use trying
to hide it, Bobby.

20:36.251 --> 20:37.852
It's about me family, Kyle.

20:37.886 --> 20:38.953
Kate, why don't we
just go out and...

20:38.987 --> 20:40.154
We're Irish.

20:44.192 --> 20:46.560
Why didn't you guys
tell me about this
before now?

20:46.595 --> 20:50.398
Oh, I wanted
to protect you, Kyle,

20:50.432 --> 20:53.501
from the way it was
when the Irish first
came to America,

20:53.535 --> 20:58.072
from the jokes
and the dirty jobs
nobody else would take,

20:58.106 --> 21:00.241
and the signs
in the shop windows

21:00.275 --> 21:04.378
saying "no Irish
need apply."

21:04.413 --> 21:07.715
I wanted you
to be 100% American.

21:09.651 --> 21:11.485
Mom, that Irish immigrant stuff

21:11.520 --> 21:14.822
was, like, over
100 years ago,
wasn't it?

21:16.291 --> 21:17.725
I remember, when
i was a little boy,

21:17.759 --> 21:20.861
my mother used to make
bacon and eggs every
morning for breakfast,

21:20.896 --> 21:22.496
and we'd have
white bread, toasted,

21:22.531 --> 21:25.700
with a lot of margarine
on it and then...

21:28.670 --> 21:30.972
Hen's eggs
and a rasher of bacon.

21:31.006 --> 21:33.086
Potato cakes, bangers, and
a black-and-white pudding.

21:35.077 --> 21:36.944
What's black-
and-white pudding?

21:36.979 --> 21:40.348
Blood sausage and pork sausage.

21:40.382 --> 21:43.751
And I packed some
crubeens and colcannon
for your lunch.

21:47.356 --> 21:49.123
Kyle: I mean,
it's really weird,
you know?

21:49.157 --> 21:50.491
At first, it's like she's trying

21:50.525 --> 21:51.765
to hide where her family's from,

21:51.793 --> 21:53.394
and now she's cooking
all this Irish food,

21:53.428 --> 21:54.829
and she's even talking funny.

21:54.863 --> 21:57.164
Ok, so what about your dad
changing his name?

21:57.199 --> 21:58.632
Oh, well, it really
doesn't seem like it's

21:58.667 --> 21:59.834
such a big deal now, you know?

21:59.868 --> 22:02.136
I mean, at least
i know I got
a heritage, you know?

22:02.170 --> 22:03.471
At least I know I'm...

22:03.505 --> 22:05.406
Hey, some green!

22:05.440 --> 22:06.607
Every day.

22:06.641 --> 22:08.075
Kyle: Yeah.

22:09.711 --> 22:12.013
I guess it must be
the luck of the Irish.

22:15.050 --> 22:16.017
Kyle: That was the beginning

22:16.051 --> 22:18.652
of the unluckiest day
of my life.

22:25.293 --> 22:27.461
I lost my homework.
It must have fallen...

22:45.781 --> 22:47.915
Hey, lookin' good.

23:17.779 --> 23:20.181
What's up, Kyle?
Did you eat already?

23:20.215 --> 23:22.316
I lost my lunch.

23:22.350 --> 23:24.919
Yeah, and on your pants, too.

23:24.953 --> 23:27.021
Ew, that's nasty.

23:27.055 --> 23:28.255
Kyle: Well, I was
gonna, you know,

23:28.290 --> 23:30.224
buy my lunch,
but I lost my money.

23:30.258 --> 23:31.592
Well, you want some chips?

23:31.626 --> 23:33.294
They're emerald isle.

23:33.328 --> 23:35.062
Look, that's never
happened to me,
Russell, all right?

23:35.097 --> 23:37.264
I can't remember losing
anything, ever.

23:37.299 --> 23:38.432
In my whole life.

23:38.467 --> 23:40.701
Look, it is just bad luck.

23:40.735 --> 23:43.370
It happens to everybody.

23:43.405 --> 23:45.139
Hey, Kyle, you want my dessert?

23:45.173 --> 23:46.440
Chocolate makes me break out.

23:46.475 --> 23:47.741
Kyle: Yeah.

23:49.344 --> 23:50.811
Well, so much for bad luck.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.470
Hey, Kyle can touch the rim.

23:59.504 --> 24:00.438
No way, man.

24:00.472 --> 24:01.672
Yeah, way, man.
I saw him do it.

24:01.706 --> 24:03.507
Come on. Hey, Kyle!

24:03.542 --> 24:04.575
Show 'em how you
can touch the rim.

24:04.609 --> 24:07.378
Come on, Kyle.
Let's see.
Yeah.

24:07.412 --> 24:09.380
Show 'em how to do it, Kyle.

24:09.414 --> 24:11.582
Get it, man.
Do it!

24:13.018 --> 24:15.753
Boys: Aw!

24:15.787 --> 24:17.587
Get a ladder, man,
you can't even get the net.

24:20.125 --> 24:23.828
Coach: All right,
let's line up, guys.

24:23.862 --> 24:27.131
Tonight is the semifinal
of the state tournament.

24:27.165 --> 24:29.200
You win tonight,
you make history.

24:29.234 --> 24:31.335
The first time
this school has ever

24:31.369 --> 24:33.204
had a basketball team make it

24:33.238 --> 24:34.472
to the championship game.

24:34.506 --> 24:36.073
Boys: Yeah! All right!

24:36.107 --> 24:38.142
Coach: All right,
all right, listen up.

24:38.176 --> 24:39.710
There's no running on game days.

24:39.744 --> 24:41.879
Make sure everybody stays sharp.

24:41.913 --> 24:44.682
I want everyone
to make 10 foul shots
before you go home.

24:44.716 --> 24:47.184
That's make 'em, not take 'em.

24:47.219 --> 24:49.220
Russell, start us off.

24:49.254 --> 24:50.955
Come on, Russ.
Let's go,
let's go.

24:58.530 --> 25:00.397
Any day now.

25:06.805 --> 25:08.806
Look, you're trying
too hard, Russ.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.709
Just relax.
Let it drop.

25:20.185 --> 25:21.752
End of the line, Kyle.

25:23.588 --> 25:26.223
Coach: Let's keep it
moving, keep it moving.

25:33.431 --> 25:34.565
Right.

25:46.478 --> 25:50.948
Ha! That's 10.
Give me 5 more.

25:52.017 --> 25:53.150
So, how many you have left?

25:53.184 --> 25:54.351
10.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.387
You haven't made any yet?

25:56.421 --> 25:59.023
Man, I've never
seen you go ice cold
like this.

25:59.057 --> 26:00.891
Yeah, that's because
I've never been ice cold.

26:00.926 --> 26:03.627
Well, you want me
to hang till you
make your shots?

26:03.662 --> 26:05.696
Nah, man, it's cool.

26:05.730 --> 26:08.566
I'll catch up with you
at the game.

26:29.354 --> 26:31.589
I think you need
a little more arc
in that shot.

26:31.623 --> 26:33.223
I just lost my temper
for a second.

26:33.258 --> 26:35.392
I don't want
to perpetuate
a stereotype,

26:35.427 --> 26:37.194
but they say the Irish
are a little hotheaded.

26:37.228 --> 26:39.496
How did you know i was Irish?

26:39.531 --> 26:41.198
Russell told me.

26:41.232 --> 26:42.866
So, what are you gonna
do for heritage day?

26:42.901 --> 26:45.169
I saw some Irish dancing
over the weekend.

26:45.203 --> 26:46.637
Maybe I could do that.

26:46.671 --> 26:47.871
You're gonna learn to step dance

26:47.906 --> 26:50.007
between now and heritage day?

26:50.041 --> 26:51.742
Didn't look that hard.

26:53.311 --> 26:56.647
Well, everything's
easy for you, isn't it?

26:56.681 --> 26:57.881
What's wrong with you?

26:57.916 --> 27:00.050
Are you mad about something?

27:00.085 --> 27:02.052
I've known you
for a long time, Kyle.

27:02.087 --> 27:03.354
You're a nice guy and all that,

27:03.388 --> 27:04.688
but you'd be a better person

27:04.723 --> 27:06.757
if everything hadn't
always been so easy for you.

27:09.127 --> 27:11.929
Look at basketball.
The last game?

27:11.963 --> 27:13.897
You guys were outplayed,
but you won anyways

27:13.932 --> 27:16.200
because <i> you</i> got lucky.

27:18.436 --> 27:20.437
The state championship
isn't supposed to be

27:20.472 --> 27:22.306
something you just luck into.

27:23.675 --> 27:24.842
Look, just because
you know everything

27:24.876 --> 27:27.144
does not mean
you know anything
about basketball.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.254
Lucky shot.

27:38.623 --> 27:41.158
That wasn't luck.
That was practice.

27:41.192 --> 27:44.762
You know, hard work?

27:44.796 --> 27:46.063
What do you mean, practice?

27:46.097 --> 27:47.665
You don't even play basketball.

27:49.901 --> 27:55.572
Kyle: It was the perfect
ending for the worst day
of my life.

27:55.607 --> 27:57.174
Too bad it wasn't over yet.

28:07.952 --> 28:09.720
Boo!

28:15.093 --> 28:17.027
Come on, get him
out of the game!

28:22.500 --> 28:24.835
You can do it, boyo!

28:26.738 --> 28:28.505
Come on, Kyle!

28:38.416 --> 28:39.983
Way to go, Drake!

28:42.587 --> 28:44.555
No!

28:49.327 --> 28:50.761
I'm open!

28:50.795 --> 28:52.429
Ohh!

28:52.464 --> 28:55.299
Take him out, coach!

28:55.333 --> 28:56.967
Aw, man!

29:10.749 --> 29:13.417
Kyle: It was like I never
played before. It was awful.

29:13.451 --> 29:15.786
I couldn't even make a shot,
and half the time

29:15.820 --> 29:18.322
I missed the rim completely.

29:18.356 --> 29:19.990
I just...

29:25.563 --> 29:27.698
Bob: Everyone has
an off night, Kyle.

29:27.732 --> 29:28.665
I never did before.

29:28.700 --> 29:30.234
The important thing
is your team won.

29:30.268 --> 29:31.735
You're going to the finals!

29:31.770 --> 29:33.303
Yeah, thanks to Drake!
He played a great game,

29:33.338 --> 29:34.638
especially after coach
took me out.

29:34.672 --> 29:37.141
You don't need to be
playing basketball.

29:37.175 --> 29:39.643
You should be hurling!

29:39.677 --> 29:43.013
Mom, I'm not sick.
I just played lousy.

29:47.018 --> 29:50.354
Are you sure you're
feeling all right?

29:50.388 --> 29:53.590
I might drink a bit
of a warm bonny-clabber

29:53.625 --> 29:54.992
before I go to bed.

30:48.613 --> 30:50.814
Do you smell something, da?

30:50.849 --> 30:51.782
I mean, dad.

30:51.816 --> 30:53.784
Smells like something's burning.

30:59.824 --> 31:02.759
Ah, boys, there's nothing
like a peat fire

31:02.794 --> 31:05.829
to put the taste of eire
in your breakfast.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.631
Ah...

31:17.442 --> 31:19.476
My dad says if we
don't win tonight,

31:19.510 --> 31:21.378
he's gonna adopt the other team.

31:21.412 --> 31:23.580
Hey, you look shorter.

31:23.615 --> 31:26.083
I think maybe I'm having
a growth-spurt.

31:26.117 --> 31:27.751
No, I'm just, uh, you know,

31:27.785 --> 31:28.919
packing on a little weight.

31:28.953 --> 31:30.787
My mom's on this Irish kick.

31:30.822 --> 31:32.122
We had spuds again...

31:32.156 --> 31:34.791
I mean, potatoes.

31:34.826 --> 31:36.159
Hey...

31:36.194 --> 31:40.030
Maybe that's why
they blocked so many
of my shots last night.

31:40.064 --> 31:41.365
I wasn't getting enough
vertical jump.

31:41.399 --> 31:42.966
You were moving ok...

31:43.001 --> 31:44.401
Like you always do.

31:46.237 --> 31:47.905
So, you think everybody's
gonna be ticked at me

31:47.939 --> 31:49.273
'cause I played so lousy?

31:49.307 --> 31:51.875
Look, they're not gonna
turn on you over one game.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.144
Besides, we're still
going to the finals.

31:54.178 --> 31:56.280
Yeah.

31:57.582 --> 31:58.882
I can't believe he did that.

31:58.917 --> 31:59.983
He's so pathetic.
Loser.

32:00.018 --> 32:01.051
You loser.

32:01.085 --> 32:03.387
Girl: Real nice.

32:03.421 --> 32:05.589
Way to choke, Johnson.

32:05.623 --> 32:07.524
Boy: Hey, watch me
touch the rim.

32:07.558 --> 32:10.527
Hey, looking good,
girls. Heh heh.

32:15.099 --> 32:16.500
Oh, look, there's Drake.

32:16.534 --> 32:19.069
Hi, Drake!
Great game.

32:20.138 --> 32:21.405
Drake, hi!

32:21.439 --> 32:23.240
Good game, Drake.

32:27.111 --> 32:29.579
Well, he did play a great game.

32:29.614 --> 32:31.648
Hey, Kyle.
I just wanted...

32:31.683 --> 32:33.250
I got to go to class.

32:35.687 --> 32:37.287
Sorry.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.794
Can anyone tell me
what a magnet is?

32:43.828 --> 32:45.062
Heh heh. Holly.

32:45.096 --> 32:47.097
A piece of iron
that attracts
another piece of iron.

32:47.131 --> 32:49.900
Good, but a magnet
doesn't just attract iron.

32:49.934 --> 32:52.903
Man, one bad game,
and I feel like
I'm nobody.

32:52.937 --> 32:55.906
Kyle, since you feel
like talking,

32:55.940 --> 32:57.941
why don't you tell us
what 3 kinds of metal

32:57.976 --> 32:59.476
are attracted by a magnet.

32:59.510 --> 33:04.414
Um, iron and, um...

33:04.449 --> 33:05.515
Anyone?

33:05.550 --> 33:07.884
Russell.

33:07.919 --> 33:09.519
Iron, cobalt, and nickel.

33:09.554 --> 33:12.589
Very good. Iron,
cobalt, and nickel.

33:12.623 --> 33:13.957
Now, take your magnet

33:13.992 --> 33:16.526
and one of the metal objects
in front of you.

33:16.561 --> 33:19.463
If that object is attracted
to the magnet,

33:19.497 --> 33:23.100
then it must contain
either iron, cobalt,
or nickel.

33:25.436 --> 33:27.471
I thought you said
that was solid gold.

33:27.505 --> 33:29.072
It is.

33:29.107 --> 33:31.608
Magnets don't lie, man.

33:31.642 --> 33:34.678
No, no, no.
This is different.

33:37.515 --> 33:40.250
This isn't my lucky coin.

33:42.086 --> 33:44.654
Look, I've got to call
my mom, all right?

33:44.689 --> 33:46.556
I bet that coin was
like a family heirloom
or something.

33:46.591 --> 33:48.091
That's probably why
she wanted me
to wear it.

33:48.126 --> 33:51.028
No, that's probably why
you had such a bad game
last night.

33:51.062 --> 33:53.363
Man, somebody must've
stolen it... ohh!

33:54.465 --> 33:57.501
Oh, for the love of Mike!

33:57.535 --> 34:00.070
Kyle! Kyle, I need
to talk to you.

34:00.104 --> 34:01.405
Look. I'm a little busy
right now.

34:01.439 --> 34:03.073
He lost his lucky charm.

34:03.107 --> 34:04.541
What?
It's a gold coin.

34:04.575 --> 34:07.210
It's probably, like,
a hundred years old.

34:07.245 --> 34:08.545
Ahh, got it.

34:08.579 --> 34:10.380
That's just a quarter.

34:13.418 --> 34:14.918
Does he look shorter to you?

34:14.952 --> 34:16.853
Nah. He just
bulked up.

34:16.888 --> 34:18.728
There's something wrong
with this stupid phone.

34:18.755 --> 34:20.056
Look, Kyle, i have to go.

34:20.091 --> 34:22.225
I'm going on a field trip
with the young achievers,

34:22.260 --> 34:23.527
and I just wanted to say

34:23.561 --> 34:26.196
I hope nothing
i said yesterday
threw off your game.

34:26.230 --> 34:27.597
You know, about you being lazy?

34:27.632 --> 34:29.366
Lazy?

34:29.400 --> 34:30.567
You never said I was lazy.

34:30.601 --> 34:32.034
I mean, all that other stuff

34:32.070 --> 34:33.335
about everything being
too easy for you,

34:33.371 --> 34:36.873
about not deserving to win
the state championship.

34:36.908 --> 34:39.076
Whoa, check out that hair.

34:39.110 --> 34:41.844
Man, my dad
won't let me dye mine.

34:41.879 --> 34:44.047
He's got this thing
about Dennis rodman.

34:53.458 --> 34:55.826
Tonight's the state
championship, man.

34:55.860 --> 34:57.327
If you cut school
without an excuse,

34:57.361 --> 34:58.829
the coach might not
let you play.

34:58.863 --> 35:00.964
An excuse? Ok.
First I find out
I've been robbed.

35:00.998 --> 35:03.033
Now my hair is turning red.

35:03.067 --> 35:06.870
Hey, I used to be
taller than you.

35:06.904 --> 35:08.872
Oh, saints preserve us.

35:08.906 --> 35:10.507
I am gettin' shorter.

35:22.987 --> 35:25.388
Mom, dad, there's
something wrong with me.

35:28.826 --> 35:30.060
There's something

35:30.094 --> 35:32.696
your mother and i
need to tell you, son.

35:34.732 --> 35:37.501
I am a leprechaun, Kyle.

35:37.535 --> 35:38.835
Huh.

35:45.810 --> 35:46.943
Mom?

35:46.978 --> 35:48.612
I know it's hard
to believe, Kyle.

35:48.646 --> 35:50.814
I mean, when I first
met your mother...

35:50.848 --> 35:52.182
You're not a leprechaun, too?

35:52.216 --> 35:53.817
No. No.
I'm from Cleveland.

35:53.851 --> 35:55.085
Oh.

35:55.119 --> 35:56.620
We'd have told you sooner, Kyle,

35:56.654 --> 35:59.322
but we wanted you
to grow up like a
normal American boy.

35:59.357 --> 36:02.025
But then when i
started to have this
wee little spell...

36:02.059 --> 36:04.361
Mom, you're a foot tall.

36:04.395 --> 36:05.695
Oh, it could be
worse, believe me.

36:05.730 --> 36:08.365
It's probably just
an allergic reaction.

36:08.399 --> 36:10.367
Boiled potatoes,
something like that.

36:10.401 --> 36:12.402
I don't think you have
any reason to worry.

36:12.436 --> 36:14.437
What?

36:15.840 --> 36:19.809
Me? You mean,
I'm a leprechaun, too?

36:19.844 --> 36:21.077
And what else would you be?

36:21.112 --> 36:23.180
And you, with the blood
of the clan O'Reilly

36:23.214 --> 36:24.381
rushin' about in your veins.

36:24.415 --> 36:25.549
Doesn't mean you can't lead

36:25.583 --> 36:27.450
a perfectly normal life, Kyle.

36:27.485 --> 36:28.451
Normal?
Yes.

36:28.486 --> 36:30.387
Normal. Dad,
look at my hair,

36:30.421 --> 36:32.556
and I'm getting shorter.

36:32.590 --> 36:33.857
You don't look short to me.

36:37.261 --> 36:39.095
How's it look, da?

36:39.130 --> 36:41.398
Maybe an inch...

36:41.432 --> 36:42.632
Or 2.

36:42.667 --> 36:43.733
2 inches?

36:43.768 --> 36:45.402
Dad, you said this was like

36:45.436 --> 36:47.037
an allergic reaction
or something.

36:47.071 --> 36:49.873
How long's it take to wear off?

36:49.907 --> 36:50.907
Well...

36:50.942 --> 36:52.382
Actually, it's never
happened before.

36:54.912 --> 36:56.813
According to your mother,

36:56.847 --> 36:58.915
as long as
the o'reillys
have their luck,

36:58.950 --> 37:01.785
every member
of the clan can pass
as a normal human.

37:01.819 --> 37:03.687
Ordinary size, all of that.

37:03.721 --> 37:06.690
Of course,
I'm not really sure
how it all works.

37:06.724 --> 37:07.857
Well, ok. Ok.

37:07.892 --> 37:09.426
Well, maybe that's
the trouble with mom,

37:09.460 --> 37:11.361
you know, I mean,
maybe we're just
out of luck.

37:11.395 --> 37:12.762
No. No. That can't be
the problem.

37:12.797 --> 37:14.731
Well, how do you know that?

37:14.765 --> 37:15.832
Your lucky coin.

37:15.866 --> 37:18.235
That's the luck of
the clan O'Reilly.

37:27.278 --> 37:28.912
Mom.

37:28.946 --> 37:31.648
Mom, I lost my lucky coin.

37:31.682 --> 37:33.917
What's this about
losing your coin,

37:33.951 --> 37:35.719
when it's hangin'
about your very neck?

37:35.753 --> 37:38.054
Look. It's not mine.
It's fake.

37:38.089 --> 37:41.258
Somebody must've switched it
with the real one.

37:44.428 --> 37:46.696
The dirty thief.

37:46.731 --> 37:49.966
It's nothin'
but a bit of iron
and gold paint on it.

37:50.001 --> 37:52.068
Are you saying somebody
stole your coin?

37:52.103 --> 37:53.770
You know, I bet it was
this really weird old guy

37:53.804 --> 37:55.038
me and Russell talked to
at the luck of the Irish,

37:55.072 --> 37:57.073
you know,
that Seamus mctiernan
dancing thing?

37:57.108 --> 37:58.842
Yeah, I bet he was like
a pickpocket or something.

37:58.876 --> 38:00.243
Wasn't that show
at the fairgrounds?

38:00.278 --> 38:02.379
Kyle, you know you're
not supposed to go there

38:02.413 --> 38:03.680
without asking us.

38:03.714 --> 38:05.615
Look, dad. I just wanted
to learn about my heritage.

38:05.650 --> 38:06.850
You can't blame him, Bobby,

38:06.884 --> 38:08.852
and we not telling
him the truth.

38:08.886 --> 38:10.854
Now, what's this
about an old man?

38:10.888 --> 38:12.322
Gray in the hair, was he?

38:12.356 --> 38:14.457
Yeah, I mean,
he started walking up to us

38:14.492 --> 38:15.859
and talking about his shoes.

38:15.893 --> 38:17.193
Said he made 'em himself.

38:17.228 --> 38:20.163
Was it a snake he had
on the sole of his shoe?

38:20.197 --> 38:23.366
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

38:23.401 --> 38:26.236
The miserable old sinner,
to play such a trick,

38:26.270 --> 38:28.071
and you his own grandson.

38:28.105 --> 38:29.539
He was my grandfather?

38:29.573 --> 38:31.374
He's your grandfather O'Reilly.

38:31.409 --> 38:34.210
And may his name be
cursed for a liar.

38:34.245 --> 38:35.545
Oh, I'll not let him
get away with it,

38:35.579 --> 38:36.713
if I have to pry the coin

38:36.747 --> 38:38.415
out of his thieving
fingers meself.

38:38.449 --> 38:39.549
And he me own da.

38:39.583 --> 38:40.884
I knew we should've moved

38:40.918 --> 38:43.086
as soon as they built
that new potato chip
factory.

38:43.120 --> 38:44.754
We were bound to run
into him sometime.

38:44.789 --> 38:45.989
You mean emerald isles?

38:46.023 --> 38:47.991
Sure, and it's he that
owns the whole company

38:48.025 --> 38:50.660
and still
can't stew oatmeal
without burning it.

38:50.695 --> 38:53.396
Come along, boys!

38:53.431 --> 38:56.833
And we'll shame him
with what he's done.

38:57.735 --> 38:59.002
Uh...

39:02.073 --> 39:03.340
Uhh!

39:04.241 --> 39:05.508
Unh!

39:08.913 --> 39:11.081
Ahh.

39:13.250 --> 39:16.086
Honey, I think maybe
i should drive.

39:16.120 --> 39:17.754
Yeah.

39:29.467 --> 39:31.868
Kate: Ohh! Ooh!

39:31.902 --> 39:33.136
Ooh!

39:33.170 --> 39:35.872
Kate, I think you
should wait in the car.

39:35.906 --> 39:38.241
You might...
Attract attention.

39:38.275 --> 39:39.409
D'unh!

39:39.443 --> 39:40.877
That's how it was

39:40.911 --> 39:42.846
when we first came
to this country, hmm?

39:42.880 --> 39:45.949
People looking
down on ya 'cause
you're a bit different.

39:47.118 --> 39:48.485
Uh, mom?

39:48.519 --> 39:51.388
Am I gonna get
as small as you are?

39:51.422 --> 39:53.923
Ah, you're only
half leprechaun, Kyle.

39:53.958 --> 39:56.259
It'll be days before
you're down to this size.

39:56.293 --> 39:57.727
Plenty of time for me
to make you

39:57.762 --> 40:00.930
some wee little ghillies
for your feet.

40:00.965 --> 40:04.067
Don't worry, Kyle.
We'll get your coin back.

40:13.344 --> 40:18.281
He says he's married to
Mr. O'Reilly's daughter.

40:18.315 --> 40:21.618
Right.

40:22.853 --> 40:25.422
The tour group is here.

40:25.456 --> 40:29.092
Son, relax. Listen.
Everything is fine.

40:29.126 --> 40:32.562
If my grandda is right...
I mean, granddad.

40:32.596 --> 40:33.763
Why don't I ever get to see him?

40:33.798 --> 40:35.765
Because I'm not...

40:35.800 --> 40:37.767
Because I'm not a leprechaun.

40:37.802 --> 40:39.269
And they don't believe
in mixed marriages.

40:39.303 --> 40:40.603
That's why we had
to leave Cleveland.

40:40.638 --> 40:41.771
We even changed our names

40:41.806 --> 40:43.273
so Kate's family
couldn't find us.

40:43.307 --> 40:45.108
Well, if you and mom,
you know, like,

40:45.142 --> 40:46.810
love each other,
why should it matter?

40:46.844 --> 40:48.578
Well...

40:48.612 --> 40:52.882
Sometimes leprechauns
can be small-minded.

40:52.917 --> 40:54.451
Come on.

40:55.786 --> 40:58.588
Right, sir.

40:58.622 --> 41:00.723
I'll handle it.

41:04.395 --> 41:07.430
Mr. O'Reilly says
he doesn't have
a daughter,

41:07.465 --> 41:08.932
and for you to go away

41:08.966 --> 41:11.734
and not to be
bothering him again.

41:11.769 --> 41:15.071
I'm not leaving here
until I see Mr. O'Reilly.

41:16.340 --> 41:17.373
Aah!

41:17.408 --> 41:18.575
Oof!

41:20.144 --> 41:21.845
Are you ok, da?

41:21.879 --> 41:24.280
Oh! Don't worry, Kyle.

41:24.315 --> 41:25.682
We're not giving up.

41:25.716 --> 41:27.417
Just gonna talk
a little strategy

41:27.451 --> 41:28.952
with your mother, that's all.

41:28.986 --> 41:30.420
Yeah.

41:45.803 --> 41:47.163
Oh, look at them.
You look so nice.

41:48.138 --> 41:50.306
On behalf of our
president and founder

41:50.341 --> 41:51.274
Mr. Reilly O'Reilly,

41:51.308 --> 41:54.143
I'd like to say welcome
to emerald isle.

41:54.178 --> 41:57.447
Uh, if you follow me,
we'll begin the tour.

42:13.230 --> 42:16.032
Please stay with the group
at all times.

42:16.066 --> 42:18.568
Some of the machinery
can be dangerous.

42:32.783 --> 42:36.286
Now, the potato chip was
invented in the late 1800s,

42:36.320 --> 42:39.422
when a cook accidentally sliced
some potatoes too thin

42:39.456 --> 42:42.492
and discovered they turned
crisp when he fried 'em.

42:42.526 --> 42:43.693
As you can see,

42:43.727 --> 42:45.795
we've come a long way
since then.

42:45.829 --> 42:48.031
Are there any questions so far?

42:48.065 --> 42:49.499
Yes?

42:49.533 --> 42:50.934
Will we get to meet
Mr. O'Reilly?

42:50.968 --> 42:52.969
Oh, no. Mr. O'Reilly
is far too busy

42:53.003 --> 42:54.137
to be seeing us today.

42:54.171 --> 42:55.805
Where's his office?

42:55.839 --> 42:58.708
It's in another part
of the building.

42:58.742 --> 43:01.711
Now, if you follow me,

43:01.745 --> 43:04.714
we'll first see
how the potatoes are washed.

43:06.083 --> 43:07.417
What are you doing here?

43:07.451 --> 43:09.218
Shh! Come on.

43:10.287 --> 43:12.555
You're not a young achiever.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.257
I have to talk
to Mr. O'Reilly.
Why?

43:14.291 --> 43:15.725
Remember how I told you
my coin was stolen?

43:15.759 --> 43:17.060
Well, I think
he's the one that took it.

43:17.094 --> 43:18.027
He's like a millionaire.

43:18.062 --> 43:19.062
Why would he steal your coin?

43:19.096 --> 43:20.196
Because he's my grandfather.

43:20.230 --> 43:21.664
Why would your grandfather
steal your coin?

43:21.699 --> 43:23.066
Do you have to know everything?

43:23.100 --> 43:24.901
He and my mom
don't really get along,

43:24.935 --> 43:26.703
and I guess he did it
to get back at her.

43:33.944 --> 43:36.613
I think we have intruders.

43:41.452 --> 43:43.386
Come on!

43:48.525 --> 43:50.026
Guard: Come on, guys!

43:55.466 --> 43:58.234
Why is your grandfather
mad at your mother?

43:58.268 --> 43:59.902
Because she married my father.

43:59.937 --> 44:01.638
Why doesn't he like your father?

44:01.672 --> 44:03.306
Because he's not a leprechaun.

44:03.340 --> 44:04.307
What?

44:04.341 --> 44:05.441
Ooh!

44:07.444 --> 44:08.778
We've got 'em!

44:08.812 --> 44:10.346
Come on!

44:25.295 --> 44:26.262
Unh!

44:26.296 --> 44:27.263
Whoa!

44:27.297 --> 44:28.431
Get in!

44:29.466 --> 44:30.900
Go!

44:31.869 --> 44:33.803
Ohh! Oh!

44:33.837 --> 44:35.738
Ohh.

44:35.773 --> 44:37.607
Aah!
Aah!

44:42.212 --> 44:43.479
Get off.
Aah!

44:43.514 --> 44:45.314
Aaaaah!

44:45.349 --> 44:46.783
Whoa!

44:58.162 --> 45:00.897
Uhh! Unh!
Let go!

45:04.201 --> 45:06.703
Aah! Aah!

45:06.737 --> 45:08.004
Kyle!

45:08.038 --> 45:10.740
Oof! Aaaaah!

45:10.774 --> 45:12.408
Aaaah! Oof!

45:18.749 --> 45:21.718
Better not bake this one, boys.

45:21.752 --> 45:24.087
I think it's me grandson.

45:24.121 --> 45:25.722
Ohh!

45:27.758 --> 45:31.094
Oh! Oh! I thought
i was baked.

45:31.128 --> 45:32.628
A good boy like you

45:32.663 --> 45:34.664
has got nothing to
fear from the oven.

45:34.698 --> 45:36.933
Aaah! Kyle!

45:36.967 --> 45:38.901
Oof! Ohh!

45:38.936 --> 45:41.871
Kyle, Kyle, are you all right?

45:41.905 --> 45:43.906
Ahh, yeah.

45:43.941 --> 45:46.275
At least I found me grandda.

45:46.310 --> 45:49.445
Oh. Oh, Kyle.

45:50.414 --> 45:51.547
What?

45:53.117 --> 45:57.687
Oh, no. I'm turning
into a vulcan. Ohh.

45:57.721 --> 46:00.056
Sydney.
Mr. O'Reilly.

46:00.090 --> 46:02.425
Office.

46:02.459 --> 46:03.392
Or better yet,

46:03.427 --> 46:05.461
make yourself a pair of shoes.

46:05.496 --> 46:07.230
It's good for the soul.

46:07.264 --> 46:09.232
When you make your own shoes,

46:09.266 --> 46:11.634
you're the master of your feet.

46:11.668 --> 46:13.603
Kyle: Look. I don't want
to make a pair of shoes,

46:13.637 --> 46:15.204
and I don't want
to be a leprechaun.

46:15.239 --> 46:18.808
Oh, there's no use railing
against what you are, boyo.

46:18.842 --> 46:20.576
If green's just not your color,

46:20.611 --> 46:22.745
then why don't you
put your coin back on?

46:22.780 --> 46:24.547
Or has your ma not told you,

46:24.581 --> 46:26.582
it's the coin that
lets you pass for human?

46:26.617 --> 46:28.117
Look. I don't have
my coin.

46:28.152 --> 46:29.085
All right? You do.

46:29.119 --> 46:30.720
You took my real coin
and switched it

46:30.754 --> 46:32.421
with this fake one
so I wouldn't know
about it.

46:32.456 --> 46:33.990
I did no such thing, boyo.

46:34.024 --> 46:35.758
And I'll not have you
blacken me name

46:35.793 --> 46:37.393
by saying I did. Huh!

46:37.427 --> 46:38.995
I'll wager it's your ma
who took it...

46:39.029 --> 46:40.296
To turn you against me.

46:40.330 --> 46:42.732
Oh, it's a traitor, she is...

46:42.766 --> 46:44.400
And to her own people.

46:44.434 --> 46:46.269
My mom doesn't have the coin.

46:46.303 --> 46:47.637
She's changing faster than I am.

46:47.671 --> 46:49.806
She's this tall.

46:49.840 --> 46:51.274
Really?

46:55.846 --> 46:58.314
Is it truly stolen?

46:59.750 --> 47:01.751
Fine. None of
your ma's tricks.

47:01.785 --> 47:04.754
Oh, no. No. No.
It can't be.

47:04.788 --> 47:05.888
Why, without our luck,

47:05.923 --> 47:07.790
the O'Reilly clan
would start to...

47:07.825 --> 47:10.126
Am i... am I lookin'
a bit green?

47:11.895 --> 47:15.665
And me trousers
could use a roll.

47:15.699 --> 47:17.533
Now, why aren't you
getting short as fast
as my mom did?

47:17.568 --> 47:19.902
It's not easy for
an old man to change.

47:19.937 --> 47:21.437
Well, what does
Kyle's lucky coin

47:21.471 --> 47:24.941
have to do with
everybody turning
into a leprechaun?

47:24.975 --> 47:27.043
It's not Kyle's luck.

47:27.077 --> 47:29.946
It's the luck
of the clan O'Reilly.

47:29.980 --> 47:32.248
It's all that's held us together

47:32.282 --> 47:34.717
for a thousand years and more.

47:34.751 --> 47:37.753
A thousand years of
invasion and oppression

47:37.788 --> 47:40.022
and being forced from the land.

47:40.057 --> 47:44.126
A thousand years of
stoney fields and famine,

47:44.161 --> 47:46.229
saying good-bye forever

47:46.263 --> 47:49.866
as you get on a boat
for a distant shore.

47:51.134 --> 47:53.936
And now, when we finally
made it here in America

47:53.971 --> 47:56.806
and are just about
to have all our luck,

47:56.840 --> 47:58.908
you've lost it!

47:58.942 --> 48:01.711
Well, why did i have to wear it?

48:01.745 --> 48:03.980
Huh? Why not you
or mom?

48:04.014 --> 48:06.616
You're the youngest member
of the clan O'Reilly,

48:06.650 --> 48:10.019
and it's always the young
that have all the luck.

48:10.053 --> 48:11.320
Uhh!

48:14.224 --> 48:16.392
Oh, I might as well
go lie down in the gutter.

48:16.426 --> 48:19.228
It's nothing but bankruptcy
and ruin for the o'reillys

48:19.263 --> 48:20.897
now that our clan
is out of luck.

48:20.931 --> 48:22.398
Hey, luck isn't everything.

48:22.432 --> 48:24.233
I mean, it wasn't luck
that built this factory.

48:24.268 --> 48:26.569
Oh, a lot you know.
Ha ha ha.

48:26.603 --> 48:28.404
And I might still be
a short-order chef

48:28.438 --> 48:30.473
if it had not been
for a bit of luck one day

48:30.507 --> 48:32.508
when I sliced the spuds
too thin.

48:32.542 --> 48:34.744
Are you saying
you invented
the potato chip?

48:34.778 --> 48:37.780
That was over 100 years ago.

48:37.814 --> 48:38.748
This is all my fault.

48:38.782 --> 48:40.416
I mean, everything
was going great

48:40.450 --> 48:41.951
until I started trying
to find out what I was.

48:41.985 --> 48:43.619
Now I got red hair
and pointy ears.

48:43.654 --> 48:45.788
I wish I never would've
found out anything.

48:45.822 --> 48:47.556
I wish I didn't have a heritage.

48:47.591 --> 48:49.892
There must be something
you could do.

48:51.194 --> 48:54.397
If your coin was stolen,
you can go to the police.

48:54.431 --> 48:55.932
Oh, yeah, and tell them
I'm a leprechaun

48:55.966 --> 48:58.367
and I've lost my luck?
Yeah, right.

48:59.236 --> 49:01.203
Do you have to do that?

49:01.238 --> 49:02.939
Of course I do.

49:02.973 --> 49:04.640
I'm Irish.

49:04.675 --> 49:07.209
That's how i manifest despair.

49:09.780 --> 49:11.013
Kyle!

49:15.118 --> 49:17.119
No! No! No!

49:17.154 --> 49:19.322
I'm not Irish.
I'm an American.

49:19.356 --> 49:20.856
Look. Maybe I wasn't
the only person

49:20.891 --> 49:22.558
that got robbed at that
luck-of-the-Irish thing.

49:22.592 --> 49:24.560
You know, maybe
they already caught
the guy who did it.

49:24.594 --> 49:26.262
I'm sure we can talk
to Seamus mctiernan.

49:26.296 --> 49:28.264
What?

49:28.298 --> 49:29.732
That petty-wagger?

49:29.766 --> 49:32.802
That stage irishman
with his neon shamrocks

49:32.836 --> 49:34.770
and his heart-full-
of-blarney rubbish?

49:34.805 --> 49:35.905
Why didn't you tell me

49:35.939 --> 49:37.740
it was at his show
you lost your coin?

49:37.774 --> 49:40.209
I would've known it was him
that stole our luck.

49:40.243 --> 49:41.177
I didn't say it was him.

49:41.211 --> 49:43.612
And who else would it be?

49:43.647 --> 49:45.081
And him a fear darrig

49:45.115 --> 49:47.783
as plain as I'm standing here.

49:47.818 --> 49:49.285
Both: A what?

49:50.187 --> 49:52.421
Kate! Kate!

49:52.456 --> 49:54.090
I can't find him anywhere.

49:54.124 --> 49:55.624
I don't know where he is.

49:55.659 --> 49:56.625
Da!

49:56.660 --> 49:58.327
Kyle!

49:58.362 --> 50:00.262
I know who took my coin.

50:00.297 --> 50:01.764
It was Seamus mctiernan.

50:01.798 --> 50:03.099
Granddad says he's like

50:03.133 --> 50:04.834
a fear darrig leprechaun.

50:04.868 --> 50:06.135
He says they're all
thieves and liars.

50:06.169 --> 50:07.203
Oh, really?

50:07.237 --> 50:11.774
No. O'Reilly.
Reilly O'Reilly.

50:11.808 --> 50:14.243
And you must be Bobby.

50:14.277 --> 50:16.145
Yeah.

50:16.179 --> 50:18.114
Kate: Don't believe
a word he says, Kyle.

50:18.148 --> 50:20.049
It's he that took it
to spite me.

50:20.083 --> 50:23.452
Oh, and it'd only be giving you

50:23.487 --> 50:25.588
what you deserve,
Kathleen O'Reilly,

50:25.622 --> 50:28.190
for daring to marry
outside the little people.

50:28.225 --> 50:30.626
But I swear
on me mother's grave,

50:30.660 --> 50:32.361
it wasn't me that...
Ooh!

50:33.764 --> 50:34.864
Kyle: Ma!

50:37.300 --> 50:39.735
Don't be wasting
your sympathy on him,
Kyle,

50:39.770 --> 50:41.270
swearin' on his ma's grave.

50:41.304 --> 50:44.173
And she still livin'
in sligo and healthy
as a horse.

50:44.207 --> 50:46.709
You are a fine one
to be callin' me a liar.

50:46.743 --> 50:49.645
And did you not tell me
when you first met Bobby

50:49.679 --> 50:52.548
that he hailed from
the shores of erie?

50:52.582 --> 50:54.917
And you knowin' me ears
aren't what they used to be,

50:54.951 --> 50:57.653
and I'd never guess you
meant some lake in Ohio.

50:57.687 --> 50:59.388
You guys, that stuff's
all in the past.

50:59.423 --> 51:00.756
Can't you just forget about it?

51:00.791 --> 51:02.525
Forget the past?

51:02.559 --> 51:03.726
Yes.

51:03.760 --> 51:06.395
The important thing
is what's happening
now, today.

51:06.430 --> 51:08.830
All right, we've gotta
get our luck back
before it's too late.

51:12.736 --> 51:16.539
Well... Maybe it's too late
to be objectin' to a marriage

51:16.573 --> 51:19.475
and your boy all grown up now
like a man.

51:19.509 --> 51:23.245
Well, I'll not
be apologizing
for marrying Bob,

51:23.280 --> 51:25.514
but I am sorry
for the trouble
it caused ya.

51:30.854 --> 51:33.189
Let bygones be bygones?

51:34.291 --> 51:36.425
There's no time
for formalities, boyo.

51:36.460 --> 51:39.228
Seamus mctiernan is
makin' off with our luck.

51:39.262 --> 51:41.330
Come on.
Let's after the thief.

51:41.364 --> 51:42.765
All right!

51:42.799 --> 51:44.400
Oh...

51:44.434 --> 51:47.103
Bonnie, look...
I gotta go.

51:47.137 --> 51:48.437
I'm going with you.

51:48.472 --> 51:50.206
Well, what about
the young achievers?

51:50.240 --> 51:52.341
They're supposed to be about
seizing opportunities.

51:52.375 --> 51:54.009
How often do you get
an opportunity

51:54.044 --> 51:56.612
where you can help
a clan of leprechauns
get their luck back?

51:58.381 --> 52:01.250
Besides I only joined
the young achievers
because my parents made me.

52:01.284 --> 52:03.219
I really wanted
to play basketball.

52:03.253 --> 52:07.189
But they said the achievers
would look better
on a college application.

52:14.064 --> 52:16.332
I guess it's my car
we'll be taking.

52:16.366 --> 52:18.334
Fasten your seat belts...

52:18.368 --> 52:21.103
Goin' to be a bumpy ride.

52:25.008 --> 52:27.076
So, uh... Grandda,

52:27.110 --> 52:28.878
am I gonna grow
a beard like that?

52:28.912 --> 52:32.414
Oh, not for a good many years,
I'm glad to say.

52:32.449 --> 52:33.682
Kyle?

52:33.717 --> 52:35.851
Hey. Hey, Kyle.

52:35.886 --> 52:37.486
I wasn't sure if...

52:37.521 --> 52:40.523
Whoa. Check out those ears.

52:40.557 --> 52:42.158
Hey. Are those real?

52:42.192 --> 52:43.659
Are they getting worse?

52:45.695 --> 52:46.962
Oh...

52:52.369 --> 52:53.936
Are you ok?

52:53.970 --> 52:55.938
What's going on?

52:55.972 --> 52:58.674
I think we've got enough people
in the car already.

52:58.708 --> 53:00.643
Hey. It's that guy,

53:00.677 --> 53:02.077
with the beard.

53:02.112 --> 53:03.345
That's me grandda.

53:03.380 --> 53:05.781
Kyle, it's not our way

53:05.815 --> 53:08.117
to be tellin' the whole
world all about us.

53:08.151 --> 53:10.619
Would ya stop your jabberin'
and drive the car?

53:10.654 --> 53:12.922
Can you not see
that the road is clear?

53:12.956 --> 53:13.923
Mrs. Johnson?

53:13.957 --> 53:16.492
Hello, Russell.

53:16.526 --> 53:18.194
Aah!

53:31.841 --> 53:33.142
You wait here.

53:33.176 --> 53:35.211
I'm gonna check this out.

53:35.245 --> 53:36.345
Careful, da.

53:37.247 --> 53:38.814
Bobby. Bobby.

53:40.250 --> 53:43.085
If you get into
any trouble with Seamus,

53:43.119 --> 53:44.887
try makin' a bet with him.

53:44.921 --> 53:47.823
Ho ho. The fear darrig
all go wild for gamblin'.

53:48.725 --> 53:50.326
Thanks.

53:56.466 --> 53:58.434
Man: Yeah, let's get
this thing set up, huh?

53:58.468 --> 53:59.702
Second man:
All right.

54:13.750 --> 54:15.050
Aah!

54:19.122 --> 54:20.589
Aah!

54:20.624 --> 54:22.291
Aah!

54:22.325 --> 54:23.759
They're gettin' away!

54:23.793 --> 54:25.728
Don't let him... augh!

54:25.762 --> 54:28.163
Don't let him get away!

54:29.733 --> 54:32.701
I saw it! There's
a whole bunch of gold coins
in there! Come on!

54:41.678 --> 54:45.347
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!

54:46.349 --> 54:48.250
Ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!

54:52.589 --> 54:55.057
Ohh... Ho ho!

55:02.132 --> 55:04.566
Oh!
Aah!
Grandda!

55:04.601 --> 55:05.668
Aah!

55:07.671 --> 55:09.938
Oh, you better hang on!
Ha ha!

55:13.410 --> 55:16.078
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!

55:26.823 --> 55:29.558
Bob: K-keep your head.
What are you trying to do?

55:29.592 --> 55:31.560
Reilly, you're
gonna get us killed!

55:31.594 --> 55:34.897
Why don't you give me
some of that corned beef
and cabbage there, Patrick?

55:34.931 --> 55:37.766
I'm always happy to share a meal
with a fellow leprechaun.

55:37.801 --> 55:40.936
May the road rise up to meet ya,

55:40.970 --> 55:42.638
and may it be a slippery one.

55:46.443 --> 55:49.812
Watch out!
Aah!

55:59.522 --> 56:01.490
Aah!
Aah!

56:03.393 --> 56:05.194
Quick, get the spare!
They're gettin' away!

56:06.096 --> 56:08.130
I don't have a spare tire!

56:08.164 --> 56:09.098
What?!

56:09.132 --> 56:10.399
With all the good luck
I've always had,

56:10.467 --> 56:11.500
I never thought I'd be

56:11.534 --> 56:12.501
needin' one.

56:12.535 --> 56:14.436
Oh...

56:16.773 --> 56:20.376
Oh, I've worked up
quite an appetite.

56:20.410 --> 56:24.446
Uh, that was the last
of the corned beef, sir.

56:29.753 --> 56:32.087
Please, pl...

56:44.467 --> 56:45.701
You'd better get home.

56:45.735 --> 56:48.070
You got a big game tonight.

56:48.104 --> 56:49.371
But what about you?

56:50.907 --> 56:53.675
You're the reason that we
made it to the state finals.

56:55.445 --> 56:57.246
I can't play looking like this.

56:58.448 --> 57:00.482
I never could play anyway.

57:01.584 --> 57:03.685
Not really.

57:05.455 --> 57:08.390
I was only good
because I was lucky.

57:08.425 --> 57:10.893
Basketball isn't
everything, Kyle.

57:10.927 --> 57:12.528
I should know.

57:12.562 --> 57:15.531
Well, I can't play baseball
or football either.

57:15.565 --> 57:17.666
I meant sports isn't everything.

57:17.700 --> 57:20.402
Look, I liked who I was,
all right?

57:20.437 --> 57:22.771
And that's who I wanna be.

57:22.806 --> 57:25.874
We should've told you
a long time ago.

57:25.909 --> 57:29.278
I'm sorry, Kyle.
That was our mistake.

57:29.312 --> 57:31.947
It's ok, da.
Dad.

57:31.981 --> 57:33.816
Things could be worse, Kyle.

57:33.850 --> 57:35.717
Yeah? How?

57:41.624 --> 57:43.625
Hey, give me a hand
with this, Bobby.

57:43.660 --> 57:45.727
I think it's stuck.

57:51.568 --> 57:54.269
It's no use, grandda.
It's just our luck.

57:55.605 --> 57:58.440
It's almost enough to make you
homesick for Ireland.

58:09.252 --> 58:12.688
If you had sense enough
not to drive
without a spare tire!

58:12.722 --> 58:14.162
Or if you hadn't
married me daughter,

58:14.190 --> 58:15.430
none of this would've happened.

58:15.458 --> 58:16.859
That has nothing to do
with anything.

58:16.893 --> 58:18.560
It doesn't do any good
trying to blame
each other.

58:18.595 --> 58:20.162
I mean, I know this
is miserable, but...

58:20.196 --> 58:22.197
Please don't say
it could get worse.
It might.

58:22.232 --> 58:25.634
I was just gonna say that
everybody has bad luck,

58:25.668 --> 58:28.403
but you can make it better
if you just keep trying.

58:28.438 --> 58:32.374
I mean, when the Irish
came to America,
things were tough.

58:32.408 --> 58:34.610
And they had to work at jobs
other people wouldn't take,

58:34.644 --> 58:36.345
and they didn't get paid
what they deserved.

58:36.379 --> 58:38.647
Well, at least they got paid.

58:38.681 --> 58:41.316
The important thing is
they didn't give up.

58:41.351 --> 58:43.285
They kept trying
till things got better,

58:43.319 --> 58:45.787
and that's what
makes them special,
not where they are now,

58:45.822 --> 58:48.257
but the spirit that kept them
going on the way there.

58:48.291 --> 58:49.558
She's a young achiever.

58:49.592 --> 58:51.460
I'm an American.
That's what we all are,

58:51.494 --> 58:53.495
and Americans don't give up.

58:59.168 --> 59:01.503
Maybe I can walk down
to the gas station.

59:01.538 --> 59:02.971
I'll get a patch
to fix that tire.

59:03.006 --> 59:05.140
I'm gonna get
that top up
if it kills me.

59:05.174 --> 59:06.542
All right.
Hey, we can get
the tire off.

59:06.576 --> 59:07.943
I'll check the trunk for tools.

59:07.977 --> 59:10.512
Ok.
I'll be goin'
with you, Bobby,

59:10.547 --> 59:12.314
and not left waitin' in the car.

59:14.751 --> 59:15.951
I'd better go, too.

59:15.985 --> 59:17.452
I have to go call
the young achievers.

59:17.487 --> 59:19.488
If I get in trouble
for leaving the field trip,

59:19.522 --> 59:23.125
my dad will give me
his "you're not gonna get
into med school" speech.

59:23.159 --> 59:25.694
Well, thanks for
helping out, Bonnie.

59:26.729 --> 59:28.664
I mean, you know,
you being here.

59:28.698 --> 59:31.199
Kinda makes me
think I haven't lost
all my luck.

59:31.234 --> 59:33.135
Do you really mean that?

59:34.404 --> 59:36.605
Or is it just blarney?

59:45.615 --> 59:47.482
Hey, wait up, Mr. Johnson.

59:55.091 --> 59:56.325
What?

01:00:00.296 --> 01:00:02.731
Do you still think we
can get our luck back,
grandda?

01:00:02.765 --> 01:00:05.500
I don't want to be
lyin' to ya, boyo.

01:00:05.535 --> 01:00:08.403
But it would take
a miracle to catch
Seamus now.

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:10.105
Well, at least
it's stopped raining.

01:00:10.139 --> 01:00:12.608
Hey, look.
There's a rainbow.

01:00:14.243 --> 01:00:16.678
Hah. Hey, maybe
there's a pot of gold
at the end of it.

01:00:16.713 --> 01:00:19.548
Oh... Ha ha ha.

01:00:21.484 --> 01:00:22.918
Come on, boys.

01:00:32.495 --> 01:00:33.629
Where are we going?

01:00:33.663 --> 01:00:34.930
I don't know.

01:00:37.834 --> 01:00:39.234
Where are we going?

01:00:39.268 --> 01:00:42.270
To the end...
Of the rainbow!

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:44.940
What?

01:01:02.558 --> 01:01:04.159
Hey, you ok, grandda?

01:01:05.161 --> 01:01:07.496
You can't get to
the end of a rainbow.

01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:11.933
Well, I could, if I was
only 200 years younger.

01:01:11.968 --> 01:01:14.936
No. The rainbow's
just the sunlight
refracted in the clouds.

01:01:14.971 --> 01:01:16.071
There is no end.

01:01:16.105 --> 01:01:18.807
You some kind of scientist?

01:01:18.841 --> 01:01:20.909
I'd like to be one someday.

01:01:20.943 --> 01:01:22.344
Yes, but I'm a leprechaun.

01:01:22.378 --> 01:01:24.713
So don't be tellin' me
about rainbows.

01:01:24.747 --> 01:01:26.314
Hey, look over there!

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:28.350

01:02:38.554 --> 01:02:40.255
It's locked.

01:02:47.964 --> 01:02:49.431
How'd you do that?

01:02:49.465 --> 01:02:51.600
It's a leprechaun thing.

01:02:59.709 --> 01:03:01.243
Ah, it's our luck.

01:03:01.277 --> 01:03:02.911
Ha ha. That it is,
Kyle boy.

01:03:02.945 --> 01:03:04.479
Our lucky day.

01:03:04.514 --> 01:03:05.781
This is my coin.

01:03:05.815 --> 01:03:08.150
I can tell. It's like
this weird feeling.

01:03:08.184 --> 01:03:11.286
You can never tell
about feelings, you know.

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:15.590
So why don't we just take
the whole lot of it
to be certain, hmm?

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:17.726
Come on. Give me a hand
with the pot, boy.

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.594
What? Whoa. Grandda,
you can't take it all.

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:20.729
It's not ours.

01:03:20.763 --> 01:03:23.865
What? You think that
dirty thief deserves it?

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:27.269
And he surely stole it
from poor leprechauns
like ourselves.

01:03:27.303 --> 01:03:28.537
Well, we don't know that
for sure.

01:03:28.571 --> 01:03:30.939
And if he did steal it,
we should tell
the police.

01:03:30.973 --> 01:03:32.440
Are you daft, boy?

01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:33.742
Callin' in the peelers,

01:03:33.776 --> 01:03:38.113
when all this gold is just
lying there for the taking.

01:03:38.147 --> 01:03:39.080
You mean stealing.

01:03:39.115 --> 01:03:41.683
I mean seizing the opportunity.

01:03:43.019 --> 01:03:46.521

where girls are so pretty ♪

01:03:46.556 --> 01:03:50.525

♪ crying, "cockles and mussels,

01:04:09.145 --> 01:04:11.713
The streets aren't paved
with gold, Kyle.

01:04:11.747 --> 01:04:13.682
You have to take it
where you can find it.

01:04:13.716 --> 01:04:16.952
If you'd struggled
as I did when I first
came to this country...

01:04:16.986 --> 01:04:18.720
We didn't come
to America to steal.

01:04:20.656 --> 01:04:22.524
We came here to
work hard, get ahead,

01:04:22.558 --> 01:04:24.125
and make something of ourselves.

01:04:25.795 --> 01:04:27.395
We now, is it?

01:04:31.534 --> 01:04:33.935
Sure an' it's worth
a pot of gold

01:04:33.970 --> 01:04:37.038
to hear ye count yourself
among the little people...

01:04:38.441 --> 01:04:42.911
Even such a big,
lovely pot as this.

01:05:04.834 --> 01:05:07.202
Aah!
Oh!

01:05:07.236 --> 01:05:10.138
Run, Kyle,
run! Run! Run!

01:05:15.978 --> 01:05:17.913
O'Reilly...

01:05:17.947 --> 01:05:19.481
Aah!

01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:22.083
Grandpa.

01:05:29.792 --> 01:05:30.892
Grandpa?

01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:37.265
Ha! I've got him
by the beard, boyo.

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:39.267
And no leprechaun
can get away from that.

01:05:39.302 --> 01:05:40.402
Kyle!

01:05:41.537 --> 01:05:43.004
And you'll not be
gettin' away neither.

01:05:43.039 --> 01:05:46.541
Now, give me that lucky coin...

01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:47.909
And maybe I'll let
the old man go.

01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:50.245
Oh, don't trust him, Kyle.
He's a fear darrig...

01:05:50.279 --> 01:05:51.246
Quiet!

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:52.247
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.

01:05:52.281 --> 01:05:53.748
Fear darrig.

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:55.350
I'll make a bet with you.

01:05:55.384 --> 01:05:56.985
A wager, is it?

01:05:58.554 --> 01:06:00.221
What exactly did you
have in mind?

01:06:00.256 --> 01:06:04.526
I bet... That...
I can beat you.

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:05.760
Beat me what?

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:07.996
Video games, is it?

01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:09.931
TV trivia.

01:06:09.966 --> 01:06:11.199
Sports.

01:06:11.233 --> 01:06:13.501
If I beat you at sports,

01:06:13.536 --> 01:06:16.204
you'll let my grandda go,
and I get to keep
my lucky coin.

01:06:16.238 --> 01:06:19.708
But if you don't beat me...
Then the coin is mine

01:06:19.742 --> 01:06:21.643
and no more of this
chasin' after me.

01:06:23.379 --> 01:06:24.412
Ok.

01:06:24.447 --> 01:06:27.349
Well, you've got yourself
a wager.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:32.554
Hey, what's going on, Kyle?

01:06:33.522 --> 01:06:35.390
Where are we?

01:06:36.292 --> 01:06:38.093
And what are we wearing?

01:06:38.127 --> 01:06:41.096
It's hurling, Kyle.

01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:42.063
Grandda?

01:06:42.098 --> 01:06:45.266
Watch out for the sliotar.

01:06:45.301 --> 01:06:46.634
The what?

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:48.737
The sliotar.

01:06:54.777 --> 01:06:56.611
Man, what are we doing here?

01:06:56.645 --> 01:06:58.747
Sports.

01:07:15.431 --> 01:07:17.165
Kyle: Look, I bet Seamus i
could beat him at sports.

01:07:17.199 --> 01:07:20.301
Russell: Man, sports
are more like football,
baseball, basketball.

01:07:23.372 --> 01:07:24.906
Rrahh!

01:07:27.576 --> 01:07:29.310
You may have gotten
lucky at hurling,

01:07:29.345 --> 01:07:32.313
but you'll not be
beating me at throwing
of the chariot wheel.

01:07:32.348 --> 01:07:34.115
What kind of sports
are these anyway?

01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:37.152
Do you know nothing
at all o' your heritage?

01:07:37.186 --> 01:07:42.424
It's the games that were
played in Ireland
for 3,000 years.

01:07:42.458 --> 01:07:45.226
Oh.
Those games.

01:07:57.573 --> 01:07:59.507
What do I do now?

01:07:59.542 --> 01:08:01.242
Aaggh!
Aaggh!

01:08:01.277 --> 01:08:02.677
Punt!

01:08:08.184 --> 01:08:10.351
Ha ha ha!

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:12.620
Ha ha ha!
Yes!

01:08:12.655 --> 01:08:14.355
Do you know why
i want that coin?

01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:17.225
Does it have anything
to do with greed?

01:08:17.259 --> 01:08:18.193
Its power.

01:08:18.227 --> 01:08:20.028
Power, boyo, is what I'm after.

01:08:20.062 --> 01:08:22.596
Taking the luck from
every leprechaun in America,

01:08:22.631 --> 01:08:26.100
it's I that'll have power
over the lot of ya.

01:08:27.403 --> 01:08:30.037
Kyle's on the wrestling team
at school.

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:36.611
Well, it's just junior high.

01:08:43.919 --> 01:08:47.921
It's a king we had in Ireland,
and it's a king I'll be...

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:49.724
King of the leprechauns.

01:08:49.758 --> 01:08:52.426
Yeah? Well, in America,
we don't believe
in kings.

01:08:52.461 --> 01:08:54.229
We believe in baseball.

01:09:01.837 --> 01:09:04.171
Yeah!
Oh, ho ho!

01:09:05.774 --> 01:09:08.510
Without your luck,
there'll be no more
denying what you are.

01:09:08.544 --> 01:09:10.345
You'll see how welcome
you are in America

01:09:10.379 --> 01:09:11.845
when you're
the little people again

01:09:11.881 --> 01:09:13.581
and different from
everyone else.

01:09:13.616 --> 01:09:15.683
Then it's back to
the land of eire,

01:09:15.718 --> 01:09:18.685
back to the old country
and the old ways!

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:26.720
Ha ha!
Ha ha!

01:09:34.569 --> 01:09:36.970
This is the last of the sports.

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:40.241
If Kyle doesn't win
this one, it's all over.

01:09:40.276 --> 01:09:42.010
But dancing's not a sport.

01:09:42.044 --> 01:09:44.345
Heh! It is in Ireland.

01:09:49.919 --> 01:09:52.587
I am the Saint of the step!

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:59.427
What sort of step is that?

01:09:59.461 --> 01:10:02.030
Uh, it's my step.

01:10:09.238 --> 01:10:11.372
Wa ha ha ha!

01:10:21.116 --> 01:10:23.451
I'll have that coin now, boyo.

01:10:23.485 --> 01:10:25.186
What are you talking
about? We tied.

01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:28.056
We said, if you didn't
beat me at sports

01:10:28.090 --> 01:10:30.158
the coin was mine.

01:10:30.192 --> 01:10:32.227
Well, a tie's not beating me,

01:10:32.261 --> 01:10:34.229
so hand it over.

01:10:34.263 --> 01:10:35.430
Man, what a cheat!

01:10:35.464 --> 01:10:37.932
Oh, he's a devil
for twisting
words about.

01:10:37.967 --> 01:10:40.501
He'd make a liar tell the truth.

01:10:40.536 --> 01:10:43.972
The coin, boyo.

01:10:44.006 --> 01:10:46.808
Or I'll have to be
getting rough with you.

01:10:58.420 --> 01:10:59.654
What about my grandda?

01:10:59.688 --> 01:11:00.989
You said you'd let him go.

01:11:01.023 --> 01:11:03.992
I said I might let him go.

01:11:04.026 --> 01:11:06.394
Or I might just make him
my slave forever!

01:11:06.428 --> 01:11:07.528
I bet I can beat you
without my luck.

01:11:07.563 --> 01:11:09.364
What?
I bet I can
beat you

01:11:09.398 --> 01:11:12.066
at basketball
even without
my lucky coin.

01:11:12.101 --> 01:11:14.936
You've got nothing
left to bet, boyo.

01:11:16.872 --> 01:11:19.440
If I lose...

01:11:19.475 --> 01:11:20.808
I'll be your slave.

01:11:20.843 --> 01:11:23.378
Oh, no, don't do it, Kyle boy.

01:11:23.412 --> 01:11:24.379
And if you win,

01:11:24.413 --> 01:11:25.446
you get your luck
back, is that it?

01:11:25.481 --> 01:11:27.015
Yeah.

01:11:27.049 --> 01:11:28.716
You're not gonna
trust this guy again
are you, Kyle?

01:11:28.751 --> 01:11:30.018
Now, none of that.

01:11:30.052 --> 01:11:31.786
We're all good irishmen here.

01:11:34.156 --> 01:11:37.425
Irishmen. Yeah.

01:11:37.459 --> 01:11:38.526
Ok, so if I win...

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:41.195
<i>If</i> I win...
I get my coin back

01:11:41.230 --> 01:11:42.230
and you'll live forever

01:11:42.264 --> 01:11:44.032
in the land of my fathers

01:11:44.066 --> 01:11:46.401
and never leave
the shores of erie again.

01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:54.208
Done.

01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:09.924
Coach: Work it
down forward

01:12:09.958 --> 01:12:11.793
and pass it on to you.

01:12:11.827 --> 01:12:13.761
The fast break...

01:12:13.796 --> 01:12:15.430
Where were you guys?

01:12:15.464 --> 01:12:18.032
In Ireland.

01:12:19.101 --> 01:12:20.234
Look, we're here now, all right?

01:12:20.269 --> 01:12:22.537
Yeah, ok.
You get out there

01:12:22.571 --> 01:12:23.738
and take the tipoff, Kyle.

01:12:23.772 --> 01:12:25.039
Let's get the lead and keep it.

01:12:25.074 --> 01:12:28.242
We're not going
into double
overtime.

01:12:28.277 --> 01:12:30.745
1, 2, 3... Go!

01:12:34.867 --> 01:12:36.467
How'd we end up here?

01:12:36.502 --> 01:12:38.569
Maybe you should ask him.

01:12:39.905 --> 01:12:42.206
Do you recognize this, boyo?

01:12:42.241 --> 01:12:44.475
It's your luck I'm wearing.

01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:46.844
Isn't he a little old
for junior high?

01:12:49.348 --> 01:12:52.083
Let's just play ball, boys.

01:12:52.117 --> 01:12:54.385
Look, there's your grandda.

01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:55.953
Kyle!

01:12:57.122 --> 01:12:58.790
Woo-hoo!

01:12:58.824 --> 01:13:01.492
No, no!
Transition quickly!

01:13:01.527 --> 01:13:03.428
Get down and cover your net.

01:13:15.374 --> 01:13:18.276
Yeah! Hello,
old man.

01:13:25.684 --> 01:13:27.852
Make a run for it, Kyle,
before it's too late.

01:13:27.886 --> 01:13:29.987
Put it in, Kyle.
Let's go.

01:13:30.022 --> 01:13:31.889
I'm not going to give up now.

01:13:31.924 --> 01:13:33.591
Look, I can beat Seamus
if I try hard enough.

01:13:33.625 --> 01:13:35.226
Kyle, throw it in!

01:13:39.631 --> 01:13:41.165
You can't do it
without your luck.

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:42.667
You'll lose, Kyle.

01:13:42.701 --> 01:13:44.736
You'll be a slave forever.

01:13:44.770 --> 01:13:46.037
Let's go.

01:13:51.477 --> 01:13:52.877
Somebody get with those guys.

01:13:52.911 --> 01:13:54.145
Transition quickly.

01:14:08.026 --> 01:14:09.594
Come on.

01:14:13.832 --> 01:14:15.767
Come on. We're gonna
get this back now.

01:14:15.801 --> 01:14:19.170
We're close. Keep
the players working
right to the beat.

01:14:20.072 --> 01:14:21.973
I'm open, I'm open.

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:24.075
Ha ha ha!

01:14:36.989 --> 01:14:40.258
Russell!
Russell!

01:14:40.292 --> 01:14:43.261
Mr. O'Reilly?

01:14:43.295 --> 01:14:46.731
Take this lucky coin.

01:14:46.765 --> 01:14:49.600
And don't ask
where it come from.

01:14:49.635 --> 01:14:51.135
Oh, great. I'll
give it to Kyle.

01:14:51.170 --> 01:14:53.604
Oh, no, no! No,
it won't work for Kyle.

01:14:53.639 --> 01:14:56.808
It's a special coin
just for you.

01:14:56.842 --> 01:14:58.409
Well, hey, thanks!

01:14:58.443 --> 01:15:00.678
Cheerleaders: Come on!
Take it all the way!

01:15:00.712 --> 01:15:02.613
A boy who believes
in leprechauns

01:15:02.648 --> 01:15:04.348
will believe anything.

01:15:04.383 --> 01:15:06.584
Bring it in, Russell,
bring it in.

01:15:09.421 --> 01:15:10.955
Let's get it back.

01:15:14.193 --> 01:15:15.560
I'm open, I'm open!

01:15:21.733 --> 01:15:23.401
Yeah, Russ!

01:15:24.303 --> 01:15:26.003
Yeah!
Way to go, man.

01:15:26.038 --> 01:15:28.105
Hey, look, it's not just me.

01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:30.741
Your grandfather
gave me this lucky coin.

01:15:36.448 --> 01:15:37.815
Excuse me.

01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:39.817
There's Kyle.

01:15:39.852 --> 01:15:41.419
Seamus!

01:15:48.227 --> 01:15:50.328
It's ok, son.
Good foul, good foul.

01:15:50.362 --> 01:15:51.762
We're gonna rebound.

01:15:51.797 --> 01:15:53.231
We're gonna bring it
back to you, buddy.

01:15:53.265 --> 01:15:54.498
Let's go.

01:15:54.533 --> 01:15:56.634
Look, there's da!

01:16:01.206 --> 01:16:03.040
Why did you give Russell
that coin?

01:16:03.075 --> 01:16:04.976
I thought you could
use a little help...

01:16:05.010 --> 01:16:07.345
The way you've been playing.

01:16:07.379 --> 01:16:08.613
But it's fake, isn't it?

01:16:13.085 --> 01:16:14.852
Sure it is fake.

01:16:14.887 --> 01:16:17.488
But I wouldn't be
telling him that
if you were you.

01:16:17.522 --> 01:16:19.523
It's confidence
the boy be wanting,

01:16:19.558 --> 01:16:21.626
not some lucky coin.

01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:24.996
Oh, he's got all the luck
he needs right in here.

01:16:26.465 --> 01:16:29.233
Yeah. The luck's
inside him.

01:16:33.906 --> 01:16:35.706
And mine's inside me.

01:16:35.741 --> 01:16:37.475
The luck of the Irish.

01:16:40.012 --> 01:16:41.545
Come on, Kyle, come on!

01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:42.980
Get in the game.

01:16:43.916 --> 01:16:44.882
Come on!

01:16:44.917 --> 01:16:46.484
Make a statement.

01:16:48.186 --> 01:16:51.022
Oh, give it up,
boyo. You're
a leprechaun.

01:16:51.056 --> 01:16:52.890
And a leprechaun's
nothing without
his luck.

01:16:52.925 --> 01:16:54.892
Nobody's nothing.

01:17:05.470 --> 01:17:06.771
That wasn't luck.

01:17:06.805 --> 01:17:07.939
Yeah!

01:17:16.448 --> 01:17:18.549
Coach: Yes!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:17:18.583 --> 01:17:22.253
All right!
That's it, Russell!

01:17:45.544 --> 01:17:47.945
I touched the rim!

01:17:47.980 --> 01:17:50.781
Hey!

01:17:50.816 --> 01:17:51.949
Ooh!

01:18:20.879 --> 01:18:23.180
One more, and you've
got it... ooh!

01:18:28.887 --> 01:18:30.921
Give me the ball!

01:18:36.228 --> 01:18:38.596
Ball!

01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:40.931
Yargh!

01:18:40.966 --> 01:18:42.900
I am the Saint of the step!

01:18:42.934 --> 01:18:44.201
King of the leprechauns!

01:18:44.236 --> 01:18:46.303
You'll never beat me!

01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:03.320
Yes!
Yes!

01:19:05.490 --> 01:19:07.358
That's my son!

01:19:07.392 --> 01:19:09.393
Argh!

01:19:13.799 --> 01:19:15.933
Seamus!

01:19:15.967 --> 01:19:18.235
Come on, get up!

01:19:18.270 --> 01:19:20.671
You all right there, boyo?

01:19:22.741 --> 01:19:25.609
Reilly: You've lost
to the boy, Seamus.

01:19:25.644 --> 01:19:27.578
He beat you fair and square.

01:19:27.612 --> 01:19:29.113
Now it's time

01:19:29.147 --> 01:19:31.982
to have our luck back.

01:19:33.485 --> 01:19:35.453
A loss, is it?

01:19:35.487 --> 01:19:38.189
I lost what? This?

01:19:38.223 --> 01:19:40.491
I still got a pot
of gold on the bus.

01:19:40.525 --> 01:19:42.193
And 10 times that

01:19:42.227 --> 01:19:45.396
hidden away
in a cave at carraig.

01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:47.965
Do you remember
the rest of our bet?

01:19:47.999 --> 01:19:49.333
Oh, I remember it, boyo.

01:19:49.367 --> 01:19:51.769
Word for word.

01:19:51.803 --> 01:19:53.337
It's home you're sending me.

01:19:53.371 --> 01:19:56.740
To live forever in Ireland.

01:19:56.775 --> 01:19:59.643
I'll be king
of the leprechauns yet.

01:19:59.678 --> 01:20:01.745
And then I'll settle with you

01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:04.615
and the clan O'Reilly.

01:20:04.649 --> 01:20:07.318
I said the shores of erie.

01:20:07.352 --> 01:20:10.020
Augh! Would you at least
learn how to say it?

01:20:10.055 --> 01:20:12.056
The land of your fathers

01:20:12.090 --> 01:20:14.658
isn't <i> erie,</i> boyo.

01:20:14.693 --> 01:20:16.393
It's eire.

01:20:17.796 --> 01:20:19.363
My father's from Cleveland.

01:20:47.192 --> 01:20:49.293
Ohio!

01:20:49.327 --> 01:20:51.595
Aah!

01:20:51.630 --> 01:20:54.665
Whoa!

01:20:56.134 --> 01:20:58.836
To live forever within
the shores of lake erie.

01:20:58.870 --> 01:21:00.437
Heh! Sure hope
he can swim better

01:21:00.472 --> 01:21:02.873
than he plays basketball.

01:21:13.752 --> 01:21:16.120
Luck's got nothing
to do with it.

01:21:25.263 --> 01:21:27.965
I'm proud of you, son.

01:21:29.234 --> 01:21:30.467
Hooray!

01:21:33.271 --> 01:21:35.639
Yeah!

01:21:43.148 --> 01:21:44.782
Bonnie.

01:21:45.817 --> 01:21:47.251
Where have you been?

01:21:47.285 --> 01:21:49.520
Did your daughter not tell you

01:21:49.554 --> 01:21:50.955
she's been all day

01:21:50.989 --> 01:21:53.357
interviewing for our
scholarship program?

01:21:53.391 --> 01:21:55.726
Scholarship?

01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:58.028
From emerald isle potato chips.

01:21:58.063 --> 01:22:00.397
Why, Bonnie's
at the top of our list

01:22:00.432 --> 01:22:02.900
for a full college scholarship.

01:22:02.934 --> 01:22:05.869
After she finishes
high school, of course.

01:22:05.904 --> 01:22:07.238
Bonnie, you should have told me.

01:22:07.272 --> 01:22:08.472
Except there's one thing

01:22:08.506 --> 01:22:10.641
that might keep her
from getting it.

01:22:10.675 --> 01:22:13.444
You see, we like
our scholars to be

01:22:13.478 --> 01:22:15.145
well rounded.

01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:17.081
Does she not play
some sort of sport?

01:22:17.115 --> 01:22:20.417
Sport? Oh, yes!

01:22:20.452 --> 01:22:22.453
She's going to play
basketball next year.
Is that right, Bonnie?

01:22:22.487 --> 01:22:24.221
Whatever you say, dad.

01:22:24.256 --> 01:22:25.289
Well, you've got

01:22:25.323 --> 01:22:27.992
one lucky girl there,
Mr. Lopez.

01:22:28.026 --> 01:22:30.461
But... Aren't
we all lucky

01:22:30.495 --> 01:22:33.464
to be living
in so grand a country

01:22:33.498 --> 01:22:37.234
where... Where anything
is possible.

01:22:38.169 --> 01:22:39.270
Yeah!

01:23:09.968 --> 01:23:11.802
Woman: Very good!

01:23:13.004 --> 01:23:14.438
All right!
Yeah!

01:23:21.813 --> 01:23:24.615
Well, I'm really proud
of my mom's family

01:23:24.649 --> 01:23:25.683
and my Irish heritage,

01:23:25.717 --> 01:23:27.117
but Americans come
from all over,

01:23:27.152 --> 01:23:29.753
and not just one place,
and so do I.
