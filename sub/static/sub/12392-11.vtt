WEBVTT

00:11.770 --> 00:13.579
OOH, DID YOU GET ME
A PINATA?

00:13.610 --> 00:14.702
NOPE.

00:14.740 --> 00:16.071
PEPSI CHALLENGE?

00:16.110 --> 00:17.304
NOPE.

00:17.350 --> 00:18.374
AM I BEING EXECUTED?

00:18.410 --> 00:20.116
JUST A LITTLE EXPERIMENT.

00:20.150 --> 00:21.276
YOU KNOW, IT'S SAID
THAT WHEN YOU'RE DEPRIVED

00:21.320 --> 00:23.686
OF ONE OF YOUR FIVE SENSES,
THE OTHER FOUR COMPENSATE

00:23.720 --> 00:25.244
BY BECOMING SHARPER.

00:25.290 --> 00:28.589
NOW, I KNOW I USUALLY TEST YOU
ON WHAT YOU CAN SEE,

00:28.620 --> 00:32.624
BUT TODAY I WANT YOU TO TELL ME
WHAT YOU CAN HEAR.

00:32.660 --> 00:34.150
READY?

00:40.470 --> 00:42.131
[stove ignition ticks]

00:54.180 --> 00:56.148
ALL RIGHT.

00:56.190 --> 00:57.145
TELL ME WHAT YOU HEARD.

00:57.190 --> 01:00.387
WELL, YOU WENT FROM THE FRIDGE
TO THE STOVE.

01:00.420 --> 01:02.422
THEN YOU PICKED SOMETHING UP

01:02.460 --> 01:04.348
AND THREW IT IN THE TRASH.

01:04.390 --> 01:05.459
EXCELLENT.

01:05.490 --> 01:06.559
TAKE OFF YOUR BLINDFOLD.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.768
HEY, MY REPORT!

01:09.800 --> 01:11.392
YOU THREW IT IN THE TRASH.
WHY?

01:11.430 --> 01:12.658
BECAUSE IT WASN'T YOUR REPORT.

01:12.700 --> 01:14.338
I SAW YOU GET IT FROM GUS.

01:14.370 --> 01:17.362
NOW YOU'RE GONNA
DO THE REPORT YOURSELF.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.503
NEXT THING I WANT TO HEAR
IS THE SOUND OF THAT PENCIL

01:19.540 --> 01:21.428
MOVING ACROSS YOUR PAPER.

01:23.650 --> 01:26.369
I'D RATHER BE EXECUTED.

01:26.420 --> 01:27.819
[thunder rumbles]

01:31.620 --> 01:33.315
IT'S JUST STUPID,
THAT'S ALL.

01:33.360 --> 01:34.657
I MEAN,
IF HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY HAIR,

01:34.690 --> 01:36.521
NO ONE HAD ANY BUSINESS
CALLING HIM FUZZY WUZZY.

01:36.560 --> 01:38.255
THEY WERE
BEING IRONIC, SHAWN.

01:38.290 --> 01:39.359
YEAH, BUT HE WASN'T FUZZY,
WAS HE?

01:39.400 --> 01:40.355
NO, HE WASN'T.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.458
IRONY, SHAWN.

01:41.500 --> 01:42.489
MY POINT PRECISELY.

01:42.530 --> 01:43.724
(Juliet)
HEY, SHAWN.

01:43.770 --> 01:44.828
JULES.

01:44.870 --> 01:45.825
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING HERE?

01:45.870 --> 01:47.189
WE WERE JUST OUT
FOR A STROLL.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.229
FIGURED WE'D STOP IN
FOR A SOCIAL CALL.

01:48.270 --> 01:49.828
PLUS, GUS LEFI' HIS RETAINER
IN THE BREAK ROOM.

01:49.870 --> 01:51.235
YOU CAME
ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE

01:51.270 --> 01:53.170
IN A TORRENTIAL RAINSTORM
FOR THAT?

01:53.210 --> 01:55.337
OKAY, TRUTH IS WE WERE BORED.

01:55.380 --> 01:56.199
THE STORM
KNOCKED OUT OUR CABLE.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.468
GUS WOULDN'T PLAY
BOGGLE OR CRANIUM.

01:58.510 --> 01:59.772
I SAID I WOULD
PLAY SOME CRANIUM.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.242
THE STORM DIDN'T
KNOCK OUT OUR CABLE.

02:01.280 --> 02:02.440
SHAWN DIDN'T
PAY THE BILL.

02:02.490 --> 02:03.388
WOULD HAVE.

02:03.420 --> 02:05.342
THE STORM WOULD HAVE
KNOCKED OUT OUR CABLE.

02:05.390 --> 02:06.584
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF,
JULES.

02:06.620 --> 02:08.451
IT'S TORRENTIAL
OUT THERE.

02:08.490 --> 02:09.684
THE REAL REASON WE'RE DOWN
HERE IS TO PICK UP THE CHECK

02:09.730 --> 02:13.393
FOR OUR LAST CASE SO WE CAN
GET OUR CABLE TURNED BACK ON.

02:13.430 --> 02:15.853
THE WEATHER HAS DAMPENED
MY PSYCHIC POWERS,

02:15.900 --> 02:17.026
BUT I AM SENSING

02:17.070 --> 02:19.766
THAT SOMETHING BIG IS ABOUT
TO COME THROUGH THAT DOOR.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.734
HUGE! WE JUST GOT
A CALL FROM LASSITER.

02:21.770 --> 02:23.931
HE ARRESTED ERNESTO RAMOS CHAVEZ
20 MINUTES AGO.

02:23.970 --> 02:26.370
HE IS SECOND IN COMMAND
OF THE CINCO REYES.

02:26.410 --> 02:28.469
SO HE PLAYS THE BIG GUITAR
IN THE MARIACHI BAND?

02:28.510 --> 02:29.807
NO, SHAWN, CINCO REYES.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.374
FIVE KINGS.

02:31.410 --> 02:33.549
THEY'RE ONE OF THE MOST
DANGEROUS GANGS IN OUR COUNTRY.

02:33.580 --> 02:34.376
VERY GOOD, MR. GUSTER.

02:34.420 --> 02:36.513
LASSITER BUSTED HIM
SEVERAL YEARS AGO,

02:36.550 --> 02:37.812
BUT THE D.A. COULDN'T MAKE
THE CHARGES STICK,

02:37.850 --> 02:39.386
SO HE JUST DROPPED OFF
THE RADAR.

02:39.420 --> 02:41.251
BUT SINCE THEN WE'VE GO'I'I'EN
HARD EVIDENCE ON CHAVEZ

02:41.290 --> 02:42.427
THAT LINKS HIM TO A WHOLE
LO'ITA NASTY STUFF.

02:42.460 --> 02:44.826
ENOUGH TO PUT HIM AWAY
FOR GOOD.

02:44.860 --> 02:47.249
LASSITER DID
A GREAT THING TODAY.

02:47.300 --> 02:48.392
(Mcnab)
HEY!

02:48.430 --> 02:49.590
HE'S HERE!

02:51.600 --> 02:54.592
[thunder rumbles]

03:09.020 --> 03:12.456
(Shawn)
COME ON, DUDE,
THIS IS WAY BE'I'I'ER THAN CABLE.

03:12.490 --> 03:13.650
I DON'T KNOW.

03:13.690 --> 03:15.419
ULTIMATELY,
HE'S JUST ANOTHER BAD GUY.

03:15.460 --> 03:17.451
[thunder rumbles
and lights buzz]

03:20.300 --> 03:21.528
BOOK HIM.

03:21.560 --> 03:24.563
[applause]

03:37.680 --> 03:38.977
I GOT A TIP FROM
AN INFORMANT THAT CHAVEZ

03:39.010 --> 03:40.568
HAD FINALLY RESURFACED.

03:40.620 --> 03:41.973
I TRACKED HIM
TO THE QUICK SHOP.

03:42.020 --> 03:44.284
TOOK A POSITION
AT THE FRONT DOOR.

03:44.320 --> 03:47.312
HIS ONLY WAY OUT
WAS THROUGH ME.

03:47.360 --> 03:48.384
THE CLERK SAID IT'LL
TAKE A FEW MORE MINUTES

03:48.420 --> 03:50.729
TO PROCESS OUR CHECK.
(Mcnab)
DO YOU MIND?

03:50.760 --> 03:52.455
THE MAN IS TELLING HIS STORY.

03:52.500 --> 03:53.592
GO AHEAD.

03:53.630 --> 03:54.824
SO I WALKED UP TO HIM,

03:54.860 --> 03:56.760
SAID, "GOOD
TO SEE YOU AGAIN, CHAVEZ.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.597
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME."

03:58.630 --> 04:00.439
HE SAID, "JUST YOU?"

04:00.470 --> 04:01.869
AND I SAID, "JUST ME."

04:01.900 --> 04:04.698
(Shawn)
UH, JUST TO BE CLEAR.

04:04.740 --> 04:06.571
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT
THE QUICK SHOP ON LAS PALMAS

04:06.610 --> 04:07.474
OR THE ONE ON PRINCETON?

04:07.510 --> 04:08.477
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

04:08.510 --> 04:09.772
WELL, LET'S SAY, FOR EXAMPLE,

04:09.810 --> 04:11.471
THAT YOU'D LIKE
A BAG OF FUNYUNS.

04:11.510 --> 04:13.046
GONNA HAVE TO GO
TO THE ONE ON LAS PALMAS.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.547
(Gus)
PRINCETON DOESN'T STOCK THEM.

04:14.580 --> 04:15.649
(Shawn)
DON'T ASK ME WHY.

04:15.680 --> 04:16.339
I MEAN,
WHO DOESN'T LOVE FUNYUNS?

04:16.390 --> 04:18.483
IT WAS THE ONE ON LAS PALMAS.

04:18.520 --> 04:20.454
BUT I HAD MORE IMPORTANT THINGS
ON MY MIND THAN CHIPS.

04:20.490 --> 04:22.549
(Shawn)
WELL, NATURALLY,
YOU WERE APPREHENDING A VERY

04:22.590 --> 04:25.479
DANGEROUS CRIMINAL
FROM THE CINCOS, RIGHT?

04:25.530 --> 04:26.724
YEAH, REYES.

04:26.760 --> 04:28.557
BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW,

04:28.600 --> 04:30.522
FUNYUNS AREN'T
ACTUALLY A CHIP.

04:30.570 --> 04:32.299
SHAWN,
ENOUGH WITH THE FUNYUNS.

04:32.340 --> 04:33.489
JULES, THEY ARE
AN ONION-FLAVORED CORN SNACK.

04:33.540 --> 04:35.599
AND, FOR THE RECORD,
THEY ARE FUN.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.662
BUT GO ON.
WE'RE BEING RUDE.
YEAH.

04:38.710 --> 04:40.439
SO HOW DOES IT FEEL?

04:40.480 --> 04:42.402
YOU GUYS IN THE GANG UNIT
COULDN'T CATCH CHAVEZ

04:42.450 --> 04:43.439
AND LASSITER DID.

04:43.480 --> 04:44.845
YEAH, WHATEVER.

04:44.880 --> 04:47.019
HEY, MADE OUR JOB EASIER.

04:47.050 --> 04:48.608
KUDOS, LASSITER.

04:48.650 --> 04:49.685
THANKS, DRIMMER.

04:49.720 --> 04:51.085
DETECTIVE LASSITER,
MAY I SEE YOU IN MY OFFICE?

04:51.120 --> 04:53.350
YOU BET.

04:53.390 --> 04:56.382
PROBABLY WANTS TO GIVE ME
A COMMENDATION OR SOMETHING.

04:56.430 --> 04:57.852
PROBABLY GONNA MAKE YOU
A COP AND A HALF.

04:57.890 --> 04:59.619
[sighs]

04:59.660 --> 05:00.649
YOU DESERVE IT, CARLTON.

05:00.700 --> 05:03.760
HEY, I WIN,
WE ALL WIN.

05:06.670 --> 05:09.434
DETECTIVE,
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE

05:09.470 --> 05:11.461
AGENTS WHIELDON AND RUPP.

05:11.510 --> 05:12.579
THEY'RE FROM THE FBI NATIONAL
GANG TASK FORCE.

05:12.610 --> 05:15.534
AGENTS.

05:15.580 --> 05:16.672
GOOD OF YOU TO BE HERE.

05:16.710 --> 05:18.575
IT'S BEEN QUITE A NIGHT.

05:18.610 --> 05:19.918
WE CHOPPERED RIGHT IN WHEN
WE HEARD ABOUT THE ARREST.

05:19.950 --> 05:21.542
ERNESTO CHAVEZ HAS BEEN
A HIGH-PROFILE TARGET

05:21.580 --> 05:23.445
FOR A LONG TIME.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.515
IT'S JUST A PERFECT STORM
OF GOOD TIMING.

05:25.550 --> 05:26.778
EVEN BE'I'I'ER FOOTWORK.

05:26.820 --> 05:27.980
BUT YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO TRAVEL ALL THE WAY

05:28.020 --> 05:29.385
UP HERE
TO CONGRATULATE ME.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.022
[chuckling]

05:31.060 --> 05:33.699
WE DIDN'T.
WE'RE HERE FOR CHAVEZ.

05:33.730 --> 05:34.697
EXCUSE ME?

05:34.730 --> 05:36.823
WE CUT HIM A DEAL
AND HE TOOK IT.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.667
HE'S GONNA TURN
STATE'S WITNESS

05:38.700 --> 05:40.463
AGAINST THE REST
OF THE CINCO REYES GANG.

05:40.500 --> 05:43.537
YOU'RE JUST GONNA
LET THEM TAKE HIM?

05:43.570 --> 05:44.707
I'M SORRY, DETECTIVE.

05:44.740 --> 05:47.675
BUT ERNESTO CHAVEZ'S TESTIMONY
COULD HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT

05:47.710 --> 05:50.645
IN DISMANTLING
A MAJOR CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE.

05:50.680 --> 05:51.840
I HAVE NOT DEVOTED
COUNTLESS MAN-HOURS

05:51.880 --> 05:53.142
IN PURSUIT OF THIS SCUMBAG

05:53.180 --> 05:54.841
TO HAVE HIM COMFORTABLY
LIVE OUT HIS DAYS

05:54.880 --> 05:56.711
IN SOME WITNESS
RELOCATION PROGRAM.

05:56.750 --> 05:57.580
NO WAY.

05:57.620 --> 05:58.848
DETECTIVE,
I UNDERSTAND YOUR FRUSTRATION.

05:58.890 --> 06:00.755
HE SHOULD
BE RO'I'I'ING IN PRISON!

06:00.790 --> 06:01.984
BUT IT'S NOT
YOUR CALL TO MAKE, DETECTIVE.

06:02.020 --> 06:03.829
(Whieldon)
SO WHY DON'T YOU RUN ALONG

06:03.860 --> 06:05.885
AND FETCH US OUR WITNESS?

06:05.930 --> 06:07.090
WHY DON'T YOU KISS MY--

06:07.130 --> 06:10.588
DETECTIVE!

06:10.630 --> 06:11.665
COMBOS, DIFFERENT STORY.

06:11.700 --> 06:13.861
THEY ARE BOTH PRETZELS
AND CHEESE, AND IF YOU GET ONE

06:13.900 --> 06:17.028
WITHOUT CHEESE,
THAT MEANS THE BAG IS HAUNTED.

06:17.070 --> 06:19.868
SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM OUT
WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE.

06:19.910 --> 06:22.640
WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

06:22.680 --> 06:24.079
WELL, I GOT IT,
BUT GET THIS.

06:24.110 --> 06:25.771
THE DESK SERGEANT SAYS THAT
ALL CHECKS MUST BE ENDORSED

06:25.810 --> 06:27.072
BY CHIEF VICK.
RELAX, BUDDY.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.815
NO REASON TO GET
ALL ATHWACK.

06:28.850 --> 06:30.044
ATHWACK?
THAT'S NOT A WORD.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.045
IT'S VIENNESIUM.

06:31.090 --> 06:32.045
THAT'S NOT A LANGUAGE.

06:32.090 --> 06:34.752
CHIEF, PRESSING MATI'ER.

06:34.790 --> 06:36.485
OH, NOT NOW, SPENCER.

06:36.530 --> 06:37.758
ALL I NEED IS A SIGNATURE
AND A PEN.

06:37.790 --> 06:38.984
EITHER OF YOU GUYS
HAVE A BIC?

06:39.030 --> 06:40.952
MONTBLANC, PAPER MATE?

06:41.000 --> 06:41.955
I'LL TAKE A CRAYON.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.719
UM, AGENTS WHIELDON AND RUPP,

06:44.770 --> 06:46.123
OUR DEPARTMENT PSYCHIC,
SHAWN SPENCER.

06:46.170 --> 06:48.092
VERY IMPRESSIVE WORK,
GENTLEM EN.

06:48.140 --> 06:49.835
USUALLY TAKES ME 15 MINUTES
TO WORK LASSITER UP

06:49.870 --> 06:51.667
INTO THAT KIND OF LATHER.

06:51.710 --> 06:53.007
THEN I RINSE AND REPEAT.

06:53.040 --> 06:55.099
[lights buzz]

06:55.140 --> 06:57.677
SEE, GUYS, I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE
NOT PAYING BILLS.

06:57.710 --> 06:59.575
[gunshot]

07:21.700 --> 07:24.806
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

07:24.840 --> 07:25.829
*

07:25.870 --> 07:27.474
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

07:27.510 --> 07:29.501
* THAT I'M NOT TELLING
THE TRUTH *

07:29.550 --> 07:30.699
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

07:30.750 --> 07:32.513
* THEY JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF *

07:32.550 --> 07:33.847
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

* LEARN HOW TO BEND

07:39.860 --> 07:48.495
* I KNOW YOU KNOW *

07:48.530 --> 07:49.497
HE'S DEAD.

07:49.530 --> 07:50.622
DAMN IT!

07:50.670 --> 07:53.696
GET THE CORONER AND FORENSICS
DOWN HERE RIGHT AWAY.

07:53.740 --> 07:54.889
WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE STARING AT?

07:54.940 --> 07:56.032
HE'S GETTING AWAY.

07:56.070 --> 07:58.163
YOU'RE STANDING OVER A DEAD MAN
WITH A GUN IN YOUR HAND.

07:58.210 --> 07:59.575
AND?
AND I'D LIKE TO KNOW

07:59.610 --> 08:00.702
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED HERE.

08:00.740 --> 08:01.775
NO TIME FOR THAT, CHIEF.

08:01.810 --> 08:03.141
OUR SHOOTER'S STILL
IN THE BUILDING.

08:03.180 --> 08:05.603
MAKE TIME, DETECTIVE.

08:05.650 --> 08:07.743
I WAS ESCORTING CHAVEZ
OUT OF HIS CELL

08:07.780 --> 08:09.111
WHEN THE LIGHTS WENT OFF.

08:09.150 --> 08:11.209
I WAS ACCOSTED FROM BEHIND.
I DREW MY WEAPON.

08:11.250 --> 08:13.582
I LOST IT IN THE SCUFFLE.

08:13.620 --> 08:16.555
I HEARD A SHOT, THE LIGHTS
CAME ON, CHAVEZ WAS DEAD.

08:16.590 --> 08:18.729
I JUST RETRIEVED MY WEAPON
WHEN YOU ARRIVED ON THE SCENE.

08:18.760 --> 08:20.625
WOW, DETECTIVE,
THAT STORY'S A BIG LOAD OF CRAP.

08:20.660 --> 08:22.150
ARE YOU CALLING ME A LIAR?

08:22.200 --> 08:24.259
OH, YOU PICKING UP
ON THAT, GENIUS?

08:24.300 --> 08:26.666
DETECTIVE LASSITER!

08:26.700 --> 08:27.769
HOLD ME BACK.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.836
SHAWN, WILL YOU GET SERIOUS?
LASSITER JUST SHOT A GUY.

08:29.870 --> 08:30.859
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.
(Vick)
STAND DOWN!

08:30.910 --> 08:31.968
HE DIDN'T KILL ANYONE.

08:32.010 --> 08:33.568
HIS FINGER WASN'T
EVEN ON THE TRIGGER.

08:33.610 --> 08:34.838
[grunts]

08:34.880 --> 08:36.279
(Vick)
STAND DOWN!

08:36.310 --> 08:37.504
ALL OF YOU!

08:40.350 --> 08:43.239
CHIEF, I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS
WHAT WENT DOWN HERE.

08:43.290 --> 08:45.747
YOUR DETECTIVE JUST WASTED
MY LEAD WITNESS.

08:45.790 --> 08:48.816
AND I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA DO ABOUT IT.

08:51.060 --> 08:52.925
DETECTIVE LASSITER SAYS
HE'S NOT THE SHOOTER,

08:52.960 --> 08:54.951
THEN I BELIEVE HIM.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.558
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

08:56.600 --> 08:57.294
THANK YOU, CHIEF.

08:57.330 --> 08:58.319
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
LISTEN UP.

08:58.370 --> 09:00.099
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
OUR SHOOTER

09:00.140 --> 09:01.789
IS STILL IN THE BUILDING.
O'HARA, YOU AND I--

09:01.840 --> 09:03.569
O'HARA, TAKE THREE OFFICERS

09:03.610 --> 09:05.908
AND SEARCH THE LOWER FLOOR.

09:05.940 --> 09:08.636
THE REST OF YOU, I WANT THIS
STATION LOCKED DOWN TIGHT.

09:08.680 --> 09:11.569
EVERY WINDOW AND EXIT COVERED.

09:11.610 --> 09:13.214
EVERY ROOM AND AIR DUCT
SEARCHED.

09:13.250 --> 09:14.740
MOVE!

09:14.780 --> 09:16.589
YOU, YOU, YOU.

09:16.620 --> 09:21.250
WE ARE GONNA FOLLOW PROTOCOL
TO THE LETTER, DETECTIVE.

09:21.290 --> 09:23.326
NOW, FIRST,
I NEED TO RUN BALLISTICS

09:23.360 --> 09:24.281
ON YOUR WEAPON.

09:24.330 --> 09:26.127
RIGHT, OF COURSE.

09:31.370 --> 09:34.066
NOW I NEED A FULL STATEMENT
FROM YOU IN WRITING.

09:34.100 --> 09:35.192
GOOD LUCK FINDING A PEN.

09:35.240 --> 09:37.231
(Lassiter)
ALL DUE RESPECT, CHIEF,
I WOULD BE

09:37.270 --> 09:39.033
A LOT MORE USEFUL IN THE SEARCH.
I WASN'T ASKING.

09:46.680 --> 09:47.749
(Gus)
LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.

09:47.780 --> 09:49.270
THIS IS CREEPING ME OUT.

09:49.320 --> 09:51.709
HOLD ON A SECOND.

09:51.750 --> 09:52.887
HEY, WHERE THE HELL
ARE YOU GOING?

09:52.920 --> 09:53.989
THIS IS A CRIME SCENE.

09:54.020 --> 09:55.681
I WAS LOOKING
FOR THE BATHROOM.

09:55.720 --> 09:56.857
IS THAT NOT THE BATHROOM?

09:56.890 --> 09:58.289
YOU KNOW WHAT, NEVER MIND.
I CAN HOLD IT.

09:58.330 --> 10:01.697
UNLESS YOU WANNA FORK OVER ONE
OF THOSE EVIDENCE BAGS.

10:01.730 --> 10:03.197
GIMME A LITTLE PRIVACY?

10:03.230 --> 10:04.322
OUT!

10:04.370 --> 10:05.598
OKAY.

10:09.240 --> 10:12.232
[dog barks]

10:18.310 --> 10:20.312
AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL,
NO ONE HAS ENTERED

10:20.350 --> 10:22.341
OR EXITED THE BUILDING
SINCE LOCKDOWN.

10:22.380 --> 10:24.041
OKAY, WE'VE DONE A COMPLETE
SEARCH AND WE HAVE ALIBIS

10:24.090 --> 10:25.318
FROM ALL STAFF PRESENT.

10:25.350 --> 10:28.080
AND?
NOTHING.

10:28.120 --> 10:29.155
I THINK IT'S TIME
TO HAVE ANOTHER TALK

10:29.190 --> 10:30.350
WITH DETECTIVE LASSITER.

10:30.390 --> 10:32.153
DON'T YOU, CHIEF?

10:34.360 --> 10:37.397
DETECTIVE.

10:37.430 --> 10:39.318
WE NEED TO GO OVER SOME THINGS,
SO I NEED YOU TO TELL ME AGAIN

10:39.370 --> 10:41.099
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

10:41.140 --> 10:44.962
IT'S ALL RIGHT HERE, CHIEF.
ANY WORD ON THE SEARCH?

10:45.010 --> 10:46.875
OUR SHOOTER MUST HAVE
GOTTEN THROUGH OUR NET.

10:46.910 --> 10:48.400
WE HAVE GOT TO EXPAND
OUR PERIMETER.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.340
CARLTON, IT'S NOT
AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

10:50.380 --> 10:52.200
HAVE A SEAT.

10:56.720 --> 10:59.348
OCAM PO.

10:59.390 --> 11:02.416
WHAT'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS
DOING HERE?

11:02.460 --> 11:03.586
DETECTIVE LASSITER.

11:03.630 --> 11:07.748
I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE BEEN GOING
THROUGH A DIFFICULT DIVORCE.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.859
I ALSO SEE THAT
YOU'VE BEEN PUTTING IN

11:09.900 --> 11:12.994
QUITE A LOT
OF OVERTIME LATELY.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.393
NOT TO MENTION, YOU HAVE
A HIGHER THAN NORMAL

11:14.440 --> 11:16.362
INCIDENCE OF DISCHARGING
YOUR WEAPON.

11:16.400 --> 11:17.560
AND YOU WERE OVERHEARD

11:17.610 --> 11:20.204
SAYING YOU SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM
OUT WHEN YOU HAD THE CHANCE.

11:20.240 --> 11:22.037
ARE YOU SAYING
I AM ACTUALLY A SUSPECT?

11:22.080 --> 11:23.843
YOU'VE GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME!

11:23.880 --> 11:25.472
WE JUST NEED
TO DO A GUN RESIDUE SWAB

11:25.510 --> 11:28.274
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WASN'T
YOU WHO FIRED THE WEAPON.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.185
WE'RE JUST MAKING SURE.

11:30.220 --> 11:33.485
FINE, BUT I AM TELLING YOU
YOU ARE WASTING YOUR TIME.

11:33.520 --> 11:35.715
[knock on door]
CHIEF, WE NEED TO SPEAK.

11:35.760 --> 11:36.579
NO, WE DON'T.

11:36.620 --> 11:38.121
(Shawn)
THE SPIRIT WORLD IS ABUZZ

11:38.160 --> 11:39.821
AND MY PSYCHIC
VIBES INDICATE--

11:39.860 --> 11:42.920
NAY, INSIST THAT LASSITER
DID NOT SHOOT CHAVEZ.

11:42.970 --> 11:43.823
(Gus)
I MEAN, WE ALL KNEW

11:43.870 --> 11:44.620
THAT HE WOULD SHOOT
SOMEBODY SOMEDAY--

11:44.670 --> 11:47.366
OH, SO YOU THINK
HE'S CAPABLE OF IT?

11:47.400 --> 11:48.230
NO, HE DOESN'T.

11:48.270 --> 11:50.238
AT MOST, LASSITER
WOULD PLANT EVIDENCE.

11:50.270 --> 11:52.238
WOULD SOMEONE PLEASE GET THEM
THE HELL OUT OF HERE?

11:52.270 --> 11:54.033
I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.377
DON'T WORRY, BUDDY,
WE'RE ALL OVER THIS!

11:57.850 --> 11:59.078
LOOK, I BELIEVE LASSITER
IS INNOCENT TOO

11:59.110 --> 12:01.374
BUT WE NEED HARD EVIDENCE
TO EXONERATE HIM.

12:01.420 --> 12:04.742
NOT VISIONS OR VIBRATIONS
OR WHATEVER IT IS YOU HAVE.

12:04.790 --> 12:08.886
CHIEF, THOSE ARE BUT TWO OF
THE ARROWS IN MY PSYCHIC QUIVER.

12:08.920 --> 12:10.524
(Gus)
YOU HAVE TO GO BY THE BOOK ON
THIS ONE, CHIEF.

12:10.560 --> 12:12.084
WE UNDERSTAND.

12:12.130 --> 12:13.358
THANK YOU.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.753
OH, CHIEF,
ONE MORE THING.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.291
YOU THINK YOU COULD
SIGN THIS CHECK FOR US?

12:17.330 --> 12:18.888
WE'RE A LITTLE
BIT BROKE-ISH.

12:24.810 --> 12:27.802
YOU THINK SHE WENT BACK
INSIDE TO GET A PEN?

12:30.580 --> 12:32.070
(Gus)
I'M STILL NOT CONVINCED, SHAWN.

12:32.110 --> 12:33.475
HOW CAN YOU
BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN

12:33.520 --> 12:35.442
THAT LASSITER
DIDN'T SHOOT CHAVEZ?

12:35.480 --> 12:37.084
IT'S RELATIVELY EASY, GUS.

12:37.120 --> 12:39.441
I DECIDED TO BE
AND THEREFORE I AM.

12:39.490 --> 12:40.855
SOCRATES SAID THAT.

12:40.890 --> 12:42.118
NO, THAT WAS DESCARTES.

12:42.160 --> 12:43.127
THAT WAS THE COLOGNE
WE WORE IN HIGH SCHOOL.

12:43.160 --> 12:44.457
THAT WAS DRAKKAR NOIR.

12:44.490 --> 12:45.559
NO, THAT IS A WINE.
THAT'S PINOT NOIR.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.524
[knock on door]
(Vick)
HELLO.

12:47.560 --> 12:49.096
(Shawn)
CHIEF!

12:49.130 --> 12:51.325
WELCOME, WELCOME
TO THE FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE!

12:51.370 --> 12:52.837
COFFEE?

12:52.870 --> 12:55.088
OH, NO, NO, THANK YOU.
NO, I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

12:55.140 --> 12:56.437
NO MORE COFFEE.

12:56.470 --> 12:58.358
I'VE BEEN UP ALL NIGHT
AND WE STILL HAVEN'T

12:58.410 --> 12:59.877
FOUND ANY PHYSICAL
EVIDENCE THAT THIS

12:59.910 --> 13:02.299
MYSTERY SHOOTER
EVER EXISTED.

13:02.340 --> 13:03.409
AND WHAT'S WORSE?

13:03.450 --> 13:06.476
OCAMPO GOT A HOLD OF LASSITER'S
PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE.

13:06.510 --> 13:08.546
WOW, HE REALLY
HAS IT OUT FOR HIM.

13:08.580 --> 13:11.447
CHIEF, THOSE PSYCH EVALS
ARE RARELY ACCURATE.

13:11.490 --> 13:13.253
IT WAS PROBABLY DONE
BY SOME CRACKPOT SHRINK

13:13.290 --> 13:15.451
WITH A FAKE SWEDISH ACCENT.

13:15.490 --> 13:17.822
IT WAS THE ONE
DONE BY YOUR MOTHER.

13:17.860 --> 13:18.781
SWEET BABY J.

13:18.830 --> 13:21.253
LAST NIGHT YOU SAID
THAT LASSITER IS INNOCENT.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.597
HE IS.
CAN YOU PROVE IT?

13:22.630 --> 13:24.598
OF COURSE I CAN.

13:24.630 --> 13:26.222
OH, YOU MEAN RIGHT NOW?

13:26.270 --> 13:27.828
YES, NOW!

13:27.870 --> 13:29.929
OCAM PO HAS A WARRANT
TO SEARCH LASSITER'S PLACE

13:29.970 --> 13:32.507
AND HE'S HEADED OVER THERE
RIGHT NOW, AND UNLESS YOU

13:32.540 --> 13:33.507
HAVE SOMETHING TANGIBLE,
I DON'T THINK

13:33.540 --> 13:34.370
I CAN STOP THIS TRAIN.

13:34.410 --> 13:37.299
CHIEF, I THINK YOU CAN.
I THINK YOU CAN.

13:37.350 --> 13:38.442
I THINK YOU CAN.

13:39.510 --> 13:40.477
DON'T WORRY.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.544
I'LL DIVINE SOMETHING

13:41.580 --> 13:42.979
TO GET LASSITER OFF THE HOOK.

13:43.020 --> 13:44.146
LET'S GO!

13:54.200 --> 13:55.428
IT'S DEDICATION.

13:55.460 --> 13:57.325
IT'S CREEPY IS WHAT IT IS.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.861
THE LAB RESULTS
JUST CAME IN.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.107
I KNEW IT.

14:04.140 --> 14:06.461
LASSITER'S HAND TESTED
POSITIVE FOR G.S.R.

14:06.510 --> 14:07.636
(Shawn)
WELL, DUH.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.635
LASSITER ALWAYS HAS

14:08.680 --> 14:09.578
G.S.R. ON HIS HANDS.

14:09.610 --> 14:11.498
HE PRACTICALLY LIVES
AT THE SHOOTING RANGE.

14:11.550 --> 14:12.972
THINK HE WANTS
TO HANG AROUND HERE?

14:13.020 --> 14:14.647
BALLISTICS SAYS THE BULLET
THAT KILLED CHAVEZ

14:14.680 --> 14:16.614
DEFINITELY CAME
FROM LASSITER'S GUN.

14:16.650 --> 14:18.584
(Shawn)
ALL RIGHT.

14:18.620 --> 14:19.609
THIS MAY BE A LITTLE TOUGHER
THAN I THOUGHT.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.857
NOT FOR ME.

14:29.930 --> 14:32.592
CHIEF.

14:32.630 --> 14:34.564
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU'D BE COMING BY TODAY.

14:34.600 --> 14:37.364
I ACTUALLY HADN'T
PLANNED TO, BUT--

14:37.410 --> 14:41.232
OH, NO.

14:41.280 --> 14:44.249
DETECTIVE LASSITER,
YOU ARE THE PRIME SUSPECT

14:44.280 --> 14:45.679
IN THE MURDER
OF ERNESTO RAMON CHAVEZ

14:45.710 --> 14:49.146
AND AS OF THIS MOMENT
YOU ARE ON SUSPENSION.

14:49.180 --> 14:52.957
PLEASE RELINQUISH
YOUR BADGE.

14:55.360 --> 14:58.352
HERE,
LET ME HELP YOU WITH THIS.

15:07.470 --> 15:09.665
THAN KS.

15:12.140 --> 15:14.233
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T DO THIS,
BUDDY.

15:14.280 --> 15:17.044
AND I'M GONNA DO EVERYTHING
I CAN TO PROVE IT.

15:17.080 --> 15:18.968
I PROMISE.

15:28.590 --> 15:30.649
HOT CHEESE!

15:30.690 --> 15:32.555
DUDE, YOU KNOW THAT CHEESE
HAS GONE BAD?

15:32.590 --> 15:35.229
CONTRAIRE, MEIN HERR,
IT'S GONE GOOD, VERY GOOD.

15:35.260 --> 15:37.467
DON'T YOU KNOW CHEESE IS BEST
WHEN IT'S AGED?

15:37.500 --> 15:38.592
I READ SOMEWHERE
THAT A JAPANESE BUSINESS MAN

15:38.630 --> 15:41.690
SPENT A FORTUNE ON A ZOO-YEAR
OLD WHEEL OF JARLSBERG.

15:41.740 --> 15:44.106
I THINK YOU'RE CONFUSING THAT
WITH MONET'S WATER LILLIES.

15:44.140 --> 15:46.108
NO, I'M PRETTY SURE
IT WAS A JARLSBERG.

15:46.140 --> 15:48.074
[knock on door]

15:48.110 --> 15:49.998
DON'T YOU PEOPLE
EVER CLEAN UP IN HERE?

15:50.050 --> 15:51.074
THIS PLACE IS A STY.

15:51.110 --> 15:52.509
LASSIE, WHAT'S UP?

15:52.550 --> 15:53.676
AND THE OUTFIT, MAN.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.449
WHAT, ARE YOU BACK
ON THE JOB ALREADY?

15:55.480 --> 15:57.345
NO, THESE ARE MY CIWIES.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.210
THEY LOOK EXACTLY
LIKE YOUR WORK CLOTHES.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.478
HARDLY.

16:00.520 --> 16:01.612
I'M WEARING MY SUEDE BUCKS.

16:01.660 --> 16:04.220
THEY'RE A CASUAL
GENTLEMAN'S SHOE.

16:04.260 --> 16:05.454
(Shawn)
A CASUAL GENTLEMAN'S SHOE.

16:05.490 --> 16:07.128
WHAT ARE YOU,
THE GREAT GATSBY?

16:07.160 --> 16:08.696
GONNA DO A LITTLE SWAN WATCHING
WITH DAISY BUCHANAN LATER?

16:08.730 --> 16:10.721
WOW, HOW DID YOU
COME UP WITH THAT ONE?

16:10.770 --> 16:12.419
EIGHTH GRADE SUMMER READING.
* WHAT

16:12.470 --> 16:14.495
ANYWAY,
WE'RE GLAD TO SEE YOU.

16:14.540 --> 16:16.565
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

16:16.600 --> 16:17.999
WELL, I WANTED TO TELL YOU
HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE YOU

16:18.040 --> 16:19.337
BELIEVING MY INNOCENCE.

16:19.370 --> 16:21.338
ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING
HOW LITTLE I BELIEVE IN YOU.

16:21.380 --> 16:23.598
AND I'M STARTING MY OWN
INVESTIGATION

16:23.650 --> 16:25.572
AND I WANT YOU ON BOARD.

16:25.610 --> 16:27.510
YOU'RE HIRING US?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

16:27.550 --> 16:28.676
THEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:28.720 --> 16:30.039
I'M GIVING YOU THE CHANCE
TO WORK WITH ME.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.182
BUT WE DO THAT ALL THE TIME.

16:31.220 --> 16:32.710
ARE YOU GONNA
HELP ME OR NOT?

16:32.750 --> 16:34.081
OF COURSE WE ARE.
YOU'RE LIKE OUR BROTHER.

16:34.120 --> 16:35.155
MMM.
STEP-BROTH ER.

16:35.190 --> 16:36.350
MM-MM.
WEIRD KID WHO LIVES

16:36.390 --> 16:37.379
DOWN THE STREET
AND EATS NOTHING

16:37.430 --> 16:38.522
BUT MAYONNAISE ON SALTINES?

16:38.560 --> 16:41.529
PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT.

16:45.500 --> 16:46.728
BEFORE WE GET STARTED,
WE ALWAYS LIKE TO ASK

16:46.770 --> 16:48.192
A FEW PRELIMINARY QUESTIONS.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.662
STANDARD STUFF.

16:49.700 --> 16:50.803
FIRE AWAY.

16:50.840 --> 16:52.102
OKAY, WELL,
UM, LET'S SEE.

16:52.140 --> 16:53.801
ONE, DID YOU KILL
THAT GUY?

16:53.840 --> 16:54.738
GUS.
WHAT?

16:54.780 --> 16:57.408
GUYS, THIS IS KIND
OF A TIME-SENSITIVE ISSUE.

16:57.450 --> 17:00.248
IF I DON'T CLEAR MY NAME
IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS,

17:00.280 --> 17:01.269
MY CHANCES
BECOME VERY SLIM.

17:01.320 --> 17:02.378
NOW I NEED
TO KNOW YOUR PROCESS.

17:02.420 --> 17:03.409
HOW DO WE GET STARTED?

17:03.450 --> 17:04.587
YOU REALLY WANNA
KNOW MY PROCESS?

17:04.620 --> 17:05.780
ABSOLUTELY.

17:05.820 --> 17:07.754
USUALLY STARTS WITH A HOLLA
AND ENDS WITH A CREAMSICLE.

17:07.790 --> 17:09.212
THEN IF THERE'S
TIME IN BETWEEN,

17:09.260 --> 17:10.249
THUNDERCATS.

17:10.290 --> 17:12.258
HO!

17:12.290 --> 17:13.757
I'M DEAD.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.758
(Ocampo)
THE D.A. IS ALREADY HOUNDING ME
FOR THIS REPORT.

17:16.800 --> 17:18.722
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER
I CAN HOLD HER OFF.

17:18.770 --> 17:20.567
HOUNDING YOU?

17:20.600 --> 17:23.467
WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN, OCAMPO,
OVER DRINKS LAST NIGHT?

17:23.510 --> 17:25.307
LOOK...

17:25.340 --> 17:28.434
ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT THIS IS
A HIGHLY SENSITIVE CASE.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.505
THE SOONER WE CLEAR IT UP,
THE BETTER FOR ALL OF US.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.370
AND I'M NOT SIGNING OFF ON
ANYTHING UNTIL A THOROUGH

17:32.410 --> 17:34.173
INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.778
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

17:35.820 --> 17:37.447
THE PRETTY LITTLE
D.A. CAN WAIT.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.219
HMM.

17:39.250 --> 17:41.286
WHATEVER YOU SAY, CHIEF.

17:44.430 --> 17:46.182
CHIEF, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

17:46.230 --> 17:47.595
MM-HMM.

17:50.200 --> 17:51.326
I DON'T TRUST THAT GUY.

17:51.370 --> 17:53.793
WHO, OCAMPO?
NEITHER DO I, HE'S A SNAKE.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.489
EXACTLY, HE'S A POLITICIAN.

17:55.540 --> 17:57.428
A GUY LIKE THAT WILL SCREW
ANYONE FOR AN INDICTMENT

17:57.470 --> 17:58.801
AND WE CAN'T LET HIM
DO THAT TO LASSITER.

17:58.840 --> 18:00.239
DETECTIVE,
I'M HANDLING THIS.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.134
AND MEANWHILE,

18:02.180 --> 18:03.738
YOU HAVE CASES TO WORK.

18:03.780 --> 18:04.701
[intercom rings]

18:04.750 --> 18:06.377
[man over intercom]
CHIEF, HE'S HERE.

18:06.410 --> 18:07.877
SEND HIM IN.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.139
LOOK, O'HARA, YOU'RE DISTRACT ED
AND I CAN'T HAVE THAT.

18:11.190 --> 18:13.181
SO I'M ASSIGNING YOU
A NEW PARTNER.

18:13.220 --> 18:15.859
DRIMMER?

18:15.890 --> 18:17.482
HE'S ONE OF THE BEST
DETECT IVES THAT I'VE GOT

18:17.530 --> 18:18.827
AND HE'S WILLING
TO HELP US OUT.

18:18.860 --> 18:22.853
LOOK, O'HARA, I KNOW
THIS SITUATION IS WEIRD.

18:22.900 --> 18:24.765
UM, ALL I CAN DO IS TRY
TO BE AS CAPABLE

18:24.800 --> 18:26.358
AS YOUR FORMER PARTNER WAS.

18:26.400 --> 18:28.231
LASSITER IS STILL MY PARTNER.

18:28.270 --> 18:29.828
ABSOLUTELY.

18:29.870 --> 18:31.201
THAT DIDN'T COME OUT RIGHT.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.468
UM--

18:32.510 --> 18:33.875
YOU'RE DISMISSED.

18:46.290 --> 18:47.587
(Shawn)
GOOD NEWS, LASSIE.

18:47.620 --> 18:49.918
WE GOT YOU A GRAPE ONE.

18:49.960 --> 18:51.723
TOLD YOU I DON'T
WANT A POPSICLE.

18:51.760 --> 18:53.489
OH, WELL, GUESS WE'LL
HAVE TO SHARE THIS.

18:53.530 --> 18:54.497
HOW DO YOU SHARE A POPSICLE?

18:54.530 --> 18:56.418
I TAKE A LICK, YOU TAKE A LICK,
I TAKE A LICK,

18:56.460 --> 18:57.666
YOU TAKE A LICK,
I TAKE A LICK--

18:57.700 --> 18:59.497
IT'S YOURS.

18:59.530 --> 19:01.896
(Shawn)
ARE THOSE OVERNIGHT BAGS?

19:01.940 --> 19:03.305
YEAH, HAD 'EM IN MY TRUNK.

19:03.340 --> 19:04.307
YOU'RE STAYING HERE?

19:04.340 --> 19:05.659
MY PLACE IS A CRIME SCENE.

19:05.710 --> 19:06.904
IT'S EITHER HERE OR I'M
MUCKING WITH ONE OF YOU TWO.

19:06.940 --> 19:09.374
HERE'S FINE.
MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME.

19:09.410 --> 19:10.809
EXCELLENT.

19:10.850 --> 19:13.717
NOW, I HAVE NARROWED IT DOWN
TO 31 KNOWN ENEMIES OF CHAVEZ.

19:13.750 --> 19:15.638
ALL PEOPLE WHO WANTED HIM DEAD.

19:15.680 --> 19:17.443
IF WE SPLIT THE LIST THREE WAYS
WE CAN GET THIS DONE

19:17.490 --> 19:18.787
A LOT FASTER.

19:18.820 --> 19:20.913
OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO A DO
A THOROUGH WORK-UP

19:20.960 --> 19:22.689
OF EVERY SUSPECT
AND FIGURE OUT

19:22.720 --> 19:26.178
WHO HAD ACCESS TO
THE HOLDING CELL.

19:26.230 --> 19:27.299
[sniffs]

19:27.330 --> 19:28.592
IT'S NONE OF THOSE GUYS.

19:28.630 --> 19:29.597
ARE YOU SAYING
THAT'S YOUR METHOD

19:29.630 --> 19:30.597
FOR ALL YOUR INVESTIGATIONS?

19:30.630 --> 19:31.790
NOT ALL OF THEM.
MOST OF THEM.

19:31.830 --> 19:32.922
A GREAT MANY OF THEM, YES.

19:32.970 --> 19:34.699
I AM GETTING SOMETHING THOUGH.

19:34.740 --> 19:36.662
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT.

19:36.700 --> 19:39.260
I TOLD YOU EVERYTHING
I SAW.

19:39.310 --> 19:41.437
WHEN YOU'RE DEPRIVED
OF ONE OF YOUR FIVE SENSES,

19:41.480 --> 19:42.799
THE OTHER FOUR COMPENSATE

19:42.840 --> 19:43.875
BY BECOMING SHARPER.

19:43.910 --> 19:44.899
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

19:44.950 --> 19:45.905
UH, YEAH.

19:45.950 --> 19:47.076
NO CAN DO.

19:47.110 --> 19:49.214
I NEVER CLOSE MY EYES
WITH OTHER PEOPLE AROUND, EVER.

19:49.250 --> 19:51.718
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

19:51.750 --> 19:53.354
THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

19:53.390 --> 19:55.255
WILL YOU RELAX?

19:55.290 --> 19:56.655
HEY!

19:58.960 --> 20:00.621
OW.

20:00.660 --> 20:02.651
SENSORY DEPRIVATION.

20:02.700 --> 20:04.861
YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU SAW.

20:04.900 --> 20:06.458
NOW TELL ME WHAT YOU HEARD.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.297
RIGHT, WELL,
OBVIOUSLY I HEARD THE SOUND

20:08.340 --> 20:10.638
OF MY WEAPON GOING OFF.

20:10.670 --> 20:12.729
NO, THAT'S NOT IT.
SOMETHING ELSE.

20:12.770 --> 20:15.330
WELL, THE ONLY OTHER THING
I HEARD WAS...

20:15.380 --> 20:17.974
I HEARD A FAINT SQUEAK.

20:18.010 --> 20:19.307
YAHTZEE, THAT'S IT.

20:19.350 --> 20:20.374
THAT'S OUR FIRST LEAD.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.308
WE GO BACK TO THE CELL,
FIGURE OUT

20:22.350 --> 20:23.817
WHAT MADE THAT FAINT
LITTLE SQUEAK

20:23.850 --> 20:25.488
AND THAT'LL LEAD US
TO OUR KILLER.

20:25.520 --> 20:26.612
I HAVE TO SAY,

20:26.650 --> 20:27.981
THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE,
SPENCER.

20:28.020 --> 20:29.681
CAN I TAKE
THIS THING OFF NOW?

20:29.720 --> 20:30.982
YES, YOU MAY.

20:31.030 --> 20:31.985
GREAT,
LET'S GET OVER THERE.

20:32.030 --> 20:32.849
[bells ringing]

20:32.890 --> 20:35.324
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
THE HORCHATA GUY, WHAT?

20:35.360 --> 20:36.622
GUSTER, WE KINDA
HAVE OTHER THINGS

20:36.660 --> 20:38.662
ON OUR PLATE RIGHT NOW.

20:38.700 --> 20:39.928
DON'T MIND HIM.
HE'S OUT OF HIS MIND.

20:39.970 --> 20:41.767
THAT'S CLEARLY
THE FROZEN YOGURT GUY.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.461
[bells ringing]

20:46.770 --> 20:48.829
LET'S DO THIS.

20:48.880 --> 20:50.609
WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, LASSIE,

20:50.650 --> 20:51.901
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

20:51.950 --> 20:53.372
I'M COMING WITH YOU.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.012
BUDDY, YOU'RE UNDER
INVESTIGATION.

20:55.050 --> 20:56.642
YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE.

20:56.680 --> 20:57.749
JUST STAY HERE.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.883
WE'LL BE BACK
AS SOON AS WE CAN.

21:18.670 --> 21:20.331
JULES.

21:20.380 --> 21:21.677
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING HERE?

21:21.710 --> 21:23.940
OH, I WAS GUIDED HERE,
BY THE SPIRITS AND GUS.

21:23.980 --> 21:25.072
THE SPIRITS TOLD ME

21:25.110 --> 21:26.907
THAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO LEAD US
DOWN TO THE HOLDING CELLS.

21:26.950 --> 21:27.974
GUS JUST DROVE.

21:28.020 --> 21:28.918
ABSOLUTELY NOT, SHAWN.

21:28.950 --> 21:31.043
AS YOU CAN SEE, I AM BUSY
WITH ANOTHER CASE.

21:31.090 --> 21:32.489
JULES, WHERE'S YOUR COMPASSION?

21:32.520 --> 21:34.317
THIS IS LASSITER
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.509
HE'S YOUR COMRADE.

21:35.560 --> 21:37.323
DON'T YOU DARE LECTURE ME,
SHAWN.

21:37.360 --> 21:39.055
I AM MORE UPSET ABOUT THIS
THAN YOU COULD EVER BE.

21:39.090 --> 21:40.728
LASSITER IS MY PARTNER.

21:40.760 --> 21:42.318
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL
IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO GUS?

21:42.360 --> 21:44.089
DEPENDS ENTIRELY
ON WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.

21:44.130 --> 21:46.018
I MEAN, IF HE WAKES UP ONE DAY
AND HE'S HOWARD JONES,

21:46.070 --> 21:47.867
I'M LIKE, "DUDE, THINGS
CAN ONLY GET BETTER."

21:47.900 --> 21:48.992
HE WINS THE U.S. OPEN,

21:49.040 --> 21:50.507
I'M OPENLY WEEPING IN
THE FRONT ROW OF THE PLAYERS BOX

21:50.540 --> 21:52.360
BETWEEN HIS MOM AND HIS DAD.

21:52.410 --> 21:53.502
IF HE LEAVES THE CAKE OUT
IN THE RAIN--

21:53.540 --> 21:54.507
LOOK...

21:54.540 --> 21:55.905
THE CHIEF IS ON TOP OF THIS.

21:55.940 --> 21:57.908
SHE'S MAKING SURE THAT EVERY
PIECE OF EVIDENCE IS ANALYZED,

21:57.950 --> 21:58.974
AND EVERY PERSON IS QUESTIONED.

21:59.010 --> 22:00.978
EVEN THE GUY THAT WAS PASSED OUT
IN THE HOLDING CELL

22:01.020 --> 22:02.078
THE OTHER NIGHT.
WAIT A SECOND...

22:02.120 --> 22:03.542
THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE
DOWN THERE?

22:03.590 --> 22:05.717
YEAH, SOMEBODY
NAMED KENNETH LOGGINS.

22:05.750 --> 22:07.012
KENNY LOGGINS IS IN JAIL?

22:07.050 --> 22:08.688
THE COMPOSER
OF HOUSE AT POOH CORNER,

22:08.720 --> 22:10.722
AND THIS IS IT
HAS FALLEN ON HARD TIMES?

22:10.760 --> 22:12.022
NO, NOT THAT KENNY LOGGINS.

22:12.060 --> 22:14.051
THIS GUY IS A PETTY THIEF
AND A DRUNK.

22:14.100 --> 22:15.089
WE PICKED HIM UP
FOR VAGRANCY

22:15.130 --> 22:16.597
OUTSIDE OF TOM BLAIR'S PUB.

22:16.630 --> 22:17.790
HE WAS RELEASED
THIS MORNING.

22:17.830 --> 22:18.967
DID HE SEE ANYTHING
THAT CAN HELP US?

22:19.000 --> 22:20.558
OR MORE IMPORTANTLY...

22:20.600 --> 22:21.737
DID HE HEAR ANYTHING?

22:21.770 --> 22:24.068
NO, LIKE I SAID,
HE WAS PASSED OUT.

22:24.110 --> 22:26.806
NOW I HAVE TO GO.
DRIMMER IS WAITING FOR ME.

22:26.840 --> 22:27.977
DRIMMER?

22:28.010 --> 22:29.102
BIG, GOOFY DUDE
FROM UPSTAIRS?

22:29.140 --> 22:30.129
YOU'RE WORKING
WITH HIM NOW?

22:30.180 --> 22:31.579
IT'S ONLY TEMPORARY.

22:31.610 --> 22:33.919
JUST 'TILL LASSITER
GETS REINSTATED.

22:33.950 --> 22:36.111
LOOKS LIKE IT'S STEALTH MODE
FOR US, PARTNER.

22:36.150 --> 22:37.048
STEALTH MODE?

22:37.080 --> 22:39.116
HIT THE JACKAL SWITCH.

22:40.590 --> 22:42.581
[blows air]

22:51.430 --> 22:53.125
(Lassiter)
WHAT IS SHE DOING WITH DRIMMER?

22:56.000 --> 22:57.865
OH, MY GOD.

22:57.910 --> 23:00.572
SHE'S ALREADY
BEEN ASSIGNED A NEW PARTNER.

23:00.610 --> 23:01.599
WAIT, DO YOU KNOW
WHERE WE'RE GOING?

23:01.640 --> 23:03.369
I HAVE NO IDEA.

23:06.210 --> 23:08.440
AND HE'S LETTING HER DRIVE.

23:30.200 --> 23:33.033
LET'S JUST GET IN AND OUT
BEFORE SOMEONE CATCHES US.

23:33.070 --> 23:35.800
SOMEONE LIKE ME?

23:35.840 --> 23:37.569
I MAY YELL FOR THE GUARD,
UNLESS YOU DO WHAT I WANT.

23:37.610 --> 23:39.077
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

23:39.110 --> 23:41.078
A FRIENDLY EAR.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.747
GUS, THAT'S YOU.
I'M NOT GIVING HIM MY EAR.

23:42.780 --> 23:44.213
JUST TALK TO HIM,
BUT DON'T--

23:44.250 --> 23:45.217
DON'T GET TOO CLOSE,
'CAUSE I'M NOT ACTUALLY SURE

23:45.250 --> 23:46.581
HE DOESN'T
WANT ONE OF YOUR EARS.

23:46.620 --> 23:48.451
YOU TALK TO HIM.

23:48.490 --> 23:49.718
WILL YOU JUST GO
AND TALK TO HIM?
WHY DO I GOTTA TALK TO HIM?

23:49.760 --> 23:51.921
BECAUSE I GOTTA WALK AROUND
HERE--

23:51.960 --> 23:54.155
[both whispering at once]

24:00.270 --> 24:01.965
(Gus)
SO WHAT LINE OF WORK YOU IN?

24:02.000 --> 24:02.967
(man)
SALES.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.605
(Gus)
INSIDE OR OUTSIDE?

24:05.640 --> 24:07.130
(man)
IT'S OUTSIDE SALES.

24:07.170 --> 24:10.435
(Gus)
ANY IDEA
WHAT TERRITORY YOU SERVICE?

24:16.580 --> 24:19.981
(man)
CENTRAL COAST, MOSTLY.

24:20.020 --> 24:23.148
IT'S A HURRY.

24:23.190 --> 24:25.556
(Gus)
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO BACK
TO THE JOB YOU HAD BEFORE?

24:25.590 --> 24:27.899
(man)
I WAS A LIFE COACH.

24:27.930 --> 24:29.454
(Gus)
YOU WERE A LIFE COACH?

24:33.640 --> 24:36.097
[squeaking]

24:36.140 --> 24:38.062
I HEARD A FAINT SQUEAK.

24:47.150 --> 24:48.913
[gun shot]

24:50.050 --> 24:51.586
DUDE, I GOT IT.
LET'S GO.

24:53.020 --> 24:54.248
DID YOU KNOW THAT
BEFORE HE STABBED A GUY,

24:54.290 --> 24:55.018
HE WAS A LIFE COACH?

24:55.060 --> 24:56.755
WHO WOULD HIRE HIM
AS A LIFE COACH?

24:56.790 --> 24:58.052
THE GUY HE STABBED.

24:58.090 --> 24:59.227
YEAH, WE NEED
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

25:01.660 --> 25:02.524
IF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
IS RIGHT,

25:02.560 --> 25:03.993
AND KENNY LOGGINS
SAW THE MURDER GO DOWN,

25:04.030 --> 25:05.019
WHY WOULD HE LIE
TO THE COPS,

25:05.070 --> 25:06.196
AND SAY HE DIDN'T
SEE ANYTHING?

25:06.230 --> 25:07.834
BECAUSE WHAT HE SAW,
OR MORE IMPORTANTLY,

25:07.870 --> 25:09.531
WHO HE SAW, SCARED THE HELL
OUT OF HIM.

25:09.570 --> 25:11.299
SO KENNY LOGGINS KNOWS
WHO THE REAL KILLER IS.

25:11.340 --> 25:12.967
WHICH MEANS WE'RE HEADED
TO HIS FAVORITE DIVE.

25:13.010 --> 25:14.307
TOM BLAIRE'S PUB?

25:14.340 --> 25:15.079
IF HE WOULDN'T TELL
THE COPS,

25:15.110 --> 25:16.304
WHY DO YOU THINK
HE WOULD TELL US?

25:16.340 --> 25:18.570
I HAVE WAYS, GUS.

25:21.320 --> 25:22.639
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY WAYS, DO YOU?

25:22.680 --> 25:24.682
I HAVE CURDS AND WHEYS.

25:28.290 --> 25:29.552
[sigh]

25:50.380 --> 25:52.575
IT'S KENNY LOGGINS.

25:58.320 --> 26:09.026
SO YOU'RE SAYING HE'S NOT
ALL RIGHT.

26:09.060 --> 26:11.290
LASSI.
WHAT'S UP?

26:11.330 --> 26:12.968
YOU TOTALLY ABANDONED US.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.262
WHERE'D YOU GO?

26:14.300 --> 26:15.597
WALKING.

26:15.640 --> 26:16.937
WALKING?
WHERE?

26:16.970 --> 26:18.198
'ROUND.

26:18.240 --> 26:19.764
AND YOU'RE
NOT ANSWERING YOUR PHONE.

26:19.810 --> 26:21.778
NOTHING TO SAY.

26:21.810 --> 26:22.902
DUDE, IS THAT MY SHIRT?

26:22.940 --> 26:27.001
OH, YEAH, I-I SPILLED TAPIOCA
ON MINE.

26:27.050 --> 26:29.143
TAPIOCA?
MY TAPIOCA?

26:29.180 --> 26:30.841
THE ONE WITH THE LIGHT DUSTING
OF CINNAMON ON TOP,

26:30.890 --> 26:32.084
THAT WAS IN THE FRIDGE?

26:32.120 --> 26:32.916
YEAH.

26:32.950 --> 26:34.781
MY MOM MADE THAT.
GUS, SIMMER DOWN.

26:34.820 --> 26:37.152
LASSI, WHAT'S GOING
ON HERE?

26:37.190 --> 26:39.181
WELL, LET'S SEE...

26:39.230 --> 26:40.652
MY PARTNER'S MOVED ON,

26:40.700 --> 26:42.759
MY CAREER'S IN SHAMBLES,

26:42.800 --> 26:44.028
AND EVEN SWEET LADY JUSTICE

26:44.070 --> 26:45.367
HAS ABANDONED ME.

26:45.400 --> 26:46.799
BITCH .

26:46.830 --> 26:47.899
LOOK, YOU'RE NOT DONE YET.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.191
THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE
DOWN THERE.

26:49.240 --> 26:51.162
YEAH, KENNY LOGGINS,
HE WAS PASSED OUT.

26:51.210 --> 26:52.837
NO...NO, NO, NO.
HE WASN'T PASSED OUT.

26:52.870 --> 26:54.076
AND--AND I SENSE
THAT HE SAW EVERYTHING,

26:54.110 --> 26:55.202
AND SOMEONE KILLED HIM

26:55.240 --> 26:56.969
BECAUSE OF IT,
AND THAT SOMEONE

26:57.010 --> 26:58.204
WASN'T YOU.

26:58.250 --> 27:00.309
IT WASN'T YOU, WAS IT?
DUDE!

27:00.350 --> 27:02.841
I'M JUST SAYING, HE'S THE ONE
WHO DISAPPEARED FROM THE CAR.

27:02.880 --> 27:04.142
THIS IS A HUGE DEVELOPMENT.

27:04.190 --> 27:05.418
IT IS, YOU'RE RIGHT.

27:05.450 --> 27:07.281
THE ONE PERSON WHO CAN
GET ME OFF THE HOOK...

27:07.320 --> 27:09.311
IS NOW DEAD.

27:12.030 --> 27:13.952
THANK YOU, SPENCER.

27:16.260 --> 27:17.693
HE'S SERIOUSLY DEPRESSED.

27:17.730 --> 27:19.391
HE'S GOING
ALL BUKOWSKI ON US.

27:19.430 --> 27:21.398
I DON'T THINK WE CAN
LEAVE HIM ALONE.

27:21.440 --> 27:25.262
WHAT DO WE DO WITH HIM?

27:26.370 --> 27:28.008
(Henry)
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,

27:28.040 --> 27:30.099
I DON'T THINK LASSITER KILLED
CHAVEZ ANY MORE THAN YOU TWO DO,

27:30.140 --> 27:32.802
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN I WANT HIM
CAMPED OUT IN MY HOUSE.

27:32.850 --> 27:35.318
FOR THE RECORD, I'M ONLY 75%
SURE HE DIDN'T DO IT.

27:35.350 --> 27:36.715
GUS...
WHAT?

27:36.750 --> 27:38.012
THAT'S UP FROM YESTERDAY.

27:38.050 --> 27:39.244
DAD, LOOK,

27:39.290 --> 27:41.212
THE MAN'S CLEARLY
IN A BAD PLACE.

27:41.260 --> 27:43.410
WE JUST NEED YOU TO KEEP AN EYE
ON HIM FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

27:43.460 --> 27:45.781
YEAH, RIGHT...
HE'S IN MY KITCHEN,

27:45.830 --> 27:48.128
BREAKING MY ONLY-I-DRINK-
FROM-THE-CARTON RULE.

27:48.160 --> 27:49.752
HE IS A FELLOW COP
IN NEED OF HELP.

27:49.800 --> 27:50.824
ISN'T THAT REASON ENOUGH?

27:50.870 --> 27:52.929
[sighs]

27:54.040 --> 27:56.190
ONE DAY, ONE DAY.
NO MORE.

27:56.240 --> 27:57.161
THANK YOU.

27:57.200 --> 27:59.339
ALL RIGHT,
NOW IS THIS WHERE

27:59.370 --> 28:02.874
THE YOU-ASK-FOR-
MY-ADVICE PART COMES IN?

28:02.910 --> 28:05.140
WHAT?
NO, DAD. PLEASE.

28:05.180 --> 28:06.909
[scoffs]

28:08.380 --> 28:10.211
ALL RIGHT,
LOOK, CHECK IT OUT.

28:10.250 --> 28:12.013
WE KNOW THAT THE REAL KILLER
HAD ACCESS TO THE HOLDING CELLS,

28:12.050 --> 28:13.881
AND KNEW HOW
TO SHUT OFF THE POWER.

28:13.920 --> 28:15.979
ALL RIGHT, WELL--
SO THE JANITOR KILLED HIM.

28:16.020 --> 28:18.056
NO.

28:18.090 --> 28:20.126
DAD, I THINK
THIS WAS AN INSIDE JOB.

28:20.160 --> 28:21.092
YOU STOP RIGHT THERE, SHAWN.

28:21.130 --> 28:23.963
YOU DO NOT THROW ACCUSATIONS
LIKE THAT AROUND.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.093
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
THINK ABOUT IT.

28:26.130 --> 28:28.269
KENNY LOGGINS SAW THE SHOOTER,
BUT WAS TOO AFRAID TO I.D. HIM.

28:28.300 --> 28:29.494
NOW, WHO WOULD HE FEAR MOST?

28:29.540 --> 28:31.906
KENNY LOGGINS WAS
IN THE NEXT CELL?

28:31.940 --> 28:33.362
WH--WAS JIM MESSINA
IN THERE WITH HIM?

28:33.410 --> 28:35.401
WHO'S JIM MESSINA?
A DIFFERENT KENNY LOGGINS.

28:35.440 --> 28:36.577
LISTEN TO ME...

28:36.610 --> 28:39.078
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES DO YOU
GO INTO THAT POLICE STATION,

28:39.110 --> 28:41.169
AND SNOOP AROUND,
AND PUT YOURSELF AT RISK.

28:41.220 --> 28:42.517
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

28:42.550 --> 28:43.812
YEAH.

28:43.850 --> 28:47.240
LOOK ME IN THE EYES,
AND SAY IT.

28:47.290 --> 28:49.952
I PROMISE.
GOOD.

28:51.330 --> 28:53.753
[crunching]

28:53.800 --> 28:58.225
NOW HURRY UP.

28:58.270 --> 29:01.194
WHAT, WERE YOU RAISED
BY WOLVES?

29:01.240 --> 29:02.332
LET'S GO.
WHERE WE HEADING?

29:02.370 --> 29:03.769
POLICE STATION.

29:03.810 --> 29:04.902
YOU JUST TOLD YOUR DAD
YOU WOULDN'T GO THERE.

29:04.940 --> 29:06.760
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN ME?

29:16.280 --> 29:17.542
NOW, WHAT EXACTLY
ARE WE LOOKING FOR?

29:17.580 --> 29:19.514
ANYTHING THAT CONNECTS
KENNY LOGGINS

29:19.550 --> 29:21.154
TO SOMEONE
IN THE DEPARTMENT.

29:24.530 --> 29:25.827
(Gus)
THAT'S WEIRD.

29:25.860 --> 29:27.327
(Shawn)
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

29:27.360 --> 29:28.520
I'M IN THE ARREST DATABASE,
AND THERE'S NO RECORD

29:28.560 --> 29:29.959
OF A KENNY LOGGINS.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.126
THE DRUNKARD
OR THE GII-TED MUSICIAN.

29:31.170 --> 29:32.296
HUH.

29:32.330 --> 29:33.490
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

29:33.530 --> 29:36.192
JULES SAID HE WAS A CHRONIC
OFFENDER.

29:36.240 --> 29:37.366
THESE ARE THE HARD COPIES
OF EVERY ARREST

29:37.400 --> 29:38.537
IN THE LAST YEAR.

29:38.570 --> 29:40.333
HE SHOULD DEFINITELY BE IN HERE.

29:40.370 --> 29:43.271
DUDE, THIS THING GOES
FROM PAGE 29, TO PAGE 32.

29:43.310 --> 29:45.198
THERE'S TWO PAGES MISSING.

29:45.250 --> 29:46.842
SOMEBODY MUST'VE TAKEN IT OUT.

29:50.220 --> 29:52.438
OH, MAN, NOW MY FINGERS
ARE ALL SMUDGY.

29:52.490 --> 29:54.310
WHY DO I EVEN BOTHER
WITH MANI/PEDIS?

29:54.360 --> 29:55.850
DUDE, I THINK SOMEBODY'S HERE.

29:58.260 --> 30:00.080
ACT NATURAL.

30:02.360 --> 30:03.520
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

30:03.560 --> 30:06.222
IT WAS THE STRANGEST
THING, JULES.

30:06.270 --> 30:08.238
I'M HAVING PSYCHIC SPASMS.

30:08.270 --> 30:09.430
I BELIEVE THE ORIGIN

30:09.470 --> 30:12.962
OF THESE SPASMS IS COMING
FROM INSIDE THE RECORDS ROOM.

30:13.010 --> 30:15.331
OH, OH, THAT'S A BIGGIE.

30:17.380 --> 30:19.268
I AM SENSING THAT THERE
IS SOMETHING MISSING IN HERE.

30:19.310 --> 30:21.369
SOMETHING
TO DO WITH KENNY LOGGINS,

30:21.420 --> 30:23.217
THE CRIMINAL, NOT THE MAN
WITH FABULOUS HAIR.

30:23.250 --> 30:24.387
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

30:24.420 --> 30:25.910
OH, THERE'S ANOTHER ONE.

30:25.950 --> 30:27.383
OH, THIS IS FROM THE HIPS.

30:27.420 --> 30:30.014
THIS IS SOME SERIOUS BUSINESS.

30:30.060 --> 30:31.322
HERE. LOOK AT THIS LOG BOOK.
AND I'M SENSING

30:31.360 --> 30:33.328
THAT ALL THE RECORDS
OF HIS ARREST ARE GONE.

30:36.630 --> 30:38.325
THESE PAGES HAVE BEEN STOLEN.

30:38.370 --> 30:39.462
WHAT?

30:43.240 --> 30:44.400
WHAT?

30:44.440 --> 30:45.407
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING?

30:45.440 --> 30:47.408
I WAS THINKING OF FOOTLOOSE.

30:47.440 --> 30:49.237
WHEN THE SHE-WELDER DANCES
OVER THE CHAIR,

30:49.280 --> 30:50.577
AND THE WATER
WAS CASCADING DOWN.

30:50.610 --> 30:51.599
THAT WAS FLASHDANCE.

30:51.650 --> 30:52.901
THAT WAS AWESOME,
IS WHAT IT WAS.

30:52.950 --> 30:54.212
OH, MY GOD!

30:54.250 --> 30:56.241
WHAT, WHAT IS IT?
I SAW OCAMPO GO
IN THIS OFFICE EARLIER.

30:56.280 --> 30:57.178
HE WAS SHREDDING PAPERS.

30:57.220 --> 30:59.381
THE IA GUY?
YEAH, IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.

30:59.420 --> 31:00.614
HE HAS BIG-TIME
POLITICAL AM BITIONS,

31:00.650 --> 31:02.288
AND TAKING DOWN
A HIGH-RANKING POLICE OFFICER

31:02.320 --> 31:04.322
WOULD BE A HUGE CAREER BOOST
FOR HIM.

31:04.360 --> 31:05.884
THE SHREDDER'S BEEN EMPTIED.

31:05.930 --> 31:07.022
I THINK THE JANITOR
IS STILL HERE.

31:07.060 --> 31:08.493
COME ON, LET'S GO.

31:15.340 --> 31:16.364
I'LL GET IT, I'LL
GET IT, I'LL GET IT.

31:16.400 --> 31:17.958
THAT'S DIRTY.
UGH.

31:22.680 --> 31:24.045
AW...

31:24.080 --> 31:25.342
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO TELL ANYTHING FROM THESE.

31:25.380 --> 31:27.371
NOT Al-TER THEY'RE ALL TAPED
BACK UP TOGETHER AGAIN.

31:27.410 --> 31:28.445
TELL ME YOU'RE KIDDING.

31:28.480 --> 31:29.572
I DON'T JOKE AROUND

31:29.620 --> 31:31.349
ABOUT METICULOUSLY REASSEMBLING
SHREDDED DOCUMENTS, GUS.

31:31.390 --> 31:32.414
THIS WILL BE FUN, COME ON.

31:32.450 --> 31:33.485
LIKE DOING A PUZZLE.

31:33.520 --> 31:35.385
EXCEPT INSTEAD OF REVEALING
A SHIPWRECK OR A KITTEN,

31:35.420 --> 31:37.615
WE'LL GET OUR PROOF
THAT OCAMPO IS THE KILLER.

31:37.660 --> 31:39.184
I'LL STAY HERE AND TRY
TO TRACE ANY LOGON

31:39.230 --> 31:40.219
OCAMPO MADE
TO THE DATABASE--

31:40.260 --> 31:41.249
SOMEONE'S COMING.

31:42.330 --> 31:45.527
O'HARA, I FINISHED UP
THAT PAPERWORK FOR BOTH OF US,

31:45.570 --> 31:47.697
SO I'M GOING TO TAKE OFF
FOR THE DAY.

31:47.730 --> 31:50.096
SEE YOU AROUND, PARTNER.

31:52.670 --> 31:54.001
PARTNER.

31:54.040 --> 31:55.177
THAT'S COLD, JULIET.

31:55.210 --> 31:57.201
NO, HE IS NOT MY PARTNER,
HE JUST THINKS

31:57.240 --> 31:58.241
THAT HE IS MY PARTNER.

31:58.280 --> 32:00.100
HE'S PAID FOR COFFEE,
BROUGHT ME CUPCAKES,

32:00.150 --> 32:02.015
BUT TRUST ME,

32:02.050 --> 32:07.113
MY MIND IS 100% FOCUSED
ON LASSITER, JUST LIKE YOU.

32:07.150 --> 32:08.651
YOU GUYS ARE THINKING
ABOUT CUPCAKES, AREN'T YOU?

32:08.690 --> 32:10.419
YES.
YES.

32:15.560 --> 32:18.199
THEY'RE NOT ON HER DESK.

32:26.270 --> 32:27.601
ARE YOU GOING TO HELP OUT OR
WHAT?

32:27.640 --> 32:28.971
OH, GUS,
I'M STILL CRAMPING, MAN.

32:29.010 --> 32:30.602
IT'S MY FAULT,
I SHOULD'VE HYDRATED.

32:30.640 --> 32:32.301
(Henry)
...TAKE IT ANYMORE.
I CANNOT SPEND

32:32.350 --> 32:34.272
ONE MORE MINUTE
WITH LASSITER.

32:34.320 --> 32:38.142
HE IS...
DRIVING ME OUTTA MY MIND.

32:40.320 --> 32:42.459
(Henry)
WHAT IS THIS?

32:42.490 --> 32:43.514
NOTHING.

32:43.560 --> 32:45.425
JUST, UH--
YOU KNOW--

32:45.460 --> 32:46.484
PAPER.

32:46.530 --> 32:47.280
YOU WENT DOWN TO THE POLICE
STATION, DIDN'T YOU?

32:47.330 --> 32:48.319
I TOLD YOU
VERY SPECIFICALLY

32:48.360 --> 32:51.591
DO NOT GO DOWN THERE
AND POKE YOUR NOSE AROUND.

32:51.630 --> 32:53.325
MY NOSE IS NOT TO BLAME.
MY FEET TOOK ME THERE.

32:53.370 --> 32:55.190
ALONG WITH GUS, BUT LISTEN,

32:55.240 --> 32:56.195
WE STRUCK GOLD.

32:56.240 --> 32:57.491
IN THESE SHREDDINGS

32:57.540 --> 32:59.064
IS THE ANSWER
TO WHO KILLED KENNY LOGGINS.

32:59.110 --> 33:00.737
WE COULD USE AN EXTRA
SET OF HANDS.

33:00.770 --> 33:01.737
I'M OUTTA COMMISSION,
MY KNUCKLES ARE SWELLING.

33:01.780 --> 33:02.576
YOU SAID IT WAS CRAMPING.

33:02.610 --> 33:05.602
AH--OW.
THE PAIN IS CRIMINAL, GUS.

33:05.650 --> 33:07.299
WHAT DO YOU SAY, DAD?

33:07.350 --> 33:09.409
HELP US OUT,
OR BACK TO LASSIE?

33:14.760 --> 33:16.557
THAT BAD, HUH?

33:16.590 --> 33:17.750
CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

33:17.790 --> 33:20.486
HE'S EATEN EVERYTHING
IN MY HOUSE,

33:20.530 --> 33:22.452
HE'S RECORDING
EVERY EPISODE OF COPS.

33:22.500 --> 33:23.489
YOU LOVE COPS.

33:23.530 --> 33:24.758
NOT 25 TIMES A DAY.

33:24.800 --> 33:25.698
IT'S GOT ME NOSTALGIC

33:25.730 --> 33:27.288
FOR THE TIMES THAT
YOU WERE LIVING AT HOME.

33:27.330 --> 33:28.297
IT'S NAUSEATING.

33:28.340 --> 33:29.659
THAN KS, DAD.

33:29.700 --> 33:30.462
[bell jingling]

33:30.500 --> 33:33.105
PEANUT GUY.
YOU TWO KEEP AT IT.

33:33.140 --> 33:34.505
AND I'LL BE BACK
BEFORE YOU CAN SAY,

33:34.540 --> 33:36.735
I HEART LEGUMES.

33:43.780 --> 33:45.213
WOW.

33:45.250 --> 33:46.217
YOU'RE REALLY
GOOD AT THIS.

33:46.250 --> 33:47.182
IT'S HEREDITARY.

33:47.220 --> 33:49.757
I COME FROM A LONG LINE
OF PUZZLERS, GUS.

33:49.790 --> 33:51.280
SHAWN IS TERRIBLE
AT PUZZLES.

33:51.330 --> 33:55.221
SKIPS A GENERATION.

33:55.260 --> 33:56.295
AND THERE'S A LITTLE
SOMETHING EXTRA FOR YOU.

33:56.330 --> 33:59.595
YEAH.

33:59.630 --> 34:02.690
HEY, SHAWN!

34:02.740 --> 34:04.731
DRIMMER.
OUT FOR MY
NIGHTLY JOG.

34:04.770 --> 34:06.567
GOTTA WORK OFF
THOSE CUPCAKES.

34:06.610 --> 34:08.737
RIGHT. WELL.

34:08.780 --> 34:10.133
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

34:10.180 --> 34:11.477
HEY, LISTEN,
I WAS WONDERING SOMETHING.

34:11.510 --> 34:13.649
ARE YOU A--

34:13.680 --> 34:16.319
ARE YOU AND O'HARA...
YOU KNOW, AN ITEM?

34:16.350 --> 34:19.342
'CAUSE SHE SEEMS TO TALK
ABOUT YOU AN AWFUL LOT.

34:19.390 --> 34:20.743
REALLY?

34:20.790 --> 34:23.111
(Gus)
WHAT IS HE DOING OUT THERE?

34:23.160 --> 34:26.527
HE'S GOT THE NUTS ALREADY.
BRING 'EM IN.

34:26.560 --> 34:29.688
DOES THIS SAY
VERSA BANK?

34:29.730 --> 34:31.823
THIS IS A CREDIT CARD BILL.

34:31.870 --> 34:34.361
YEP. SO MUCH
FOR SHAWN'S THEORY.

34:34.400 --> 34:36.493
IS THAT ALL HE'S PAYING
FOR CABLE?

34:36.540 --> 34:38.838
I'M GETTING ROBBED!

34:38.870 --> 34:40.599
THAT'S FASCINATING. WHAT ELSE?
WHAT ELSE DID SHE SAY?

34:40.640 --> 34:42.779
WELL, THAT YOU'RE
VERY WITTY AND URBANE.

A MATTER OF TIME

36:44.970 --> 36:46.699
BEFORE HE POINTED

BROUGHT IN CHAVEZ,
