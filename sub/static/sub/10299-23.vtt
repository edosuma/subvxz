01:19.200 --> 01:20.433
Damn.

01:20.467 --> 01:24.033
I know that man has money
hidden here somewhere.

01:24.067 --> 01:25.433
Well, I can't
find any,

01:25.467 --> 01:28.567
and I have searched
my eyes to the bone.

01:29.801 --> 01:31.900
Well, I know it's
here somewhere.

01:31.934 --> 01:33.867
Bud, you were downstairs
for two hours.

01:33.901 --> 01:35.300
Didn't you
find anything?

01:35.334 --> 01:37.401
Uh-- Absolutely
nothing.

01:38.300 --> 01:40.301
Hm?

01:43.534 --> 01:46.468
I-- I brought these
down with me.

01:47.667 --> 01:49.667
Now, I know
he has hidden money.

01:49.701 --> 01:51.600
I got a sign
from above.

01:51.634 --> 01:55.567
This morning, the bacon strips
on my Grand Slam breakfast

01:55.601 --> 01:58.001
were in the shape
of dollar signs.

01:59.534 --> 02:02.134
You had
a Grand Slam breakfast.

02:02.267 --> 02:03.266
Oh.

02:03.300 --> 02:05.434
Didn't I take
you two with me?

02:06.968 --> 02:08.199
Oh, I know.

02:08.234 --> 02:10.800
I just ordered things
I knew you'd like.

02:10.834 --> 02:12.767
Did I have
the sausage?

02:13.801 --> 02:14.966
A double order.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.734
Ha.

02:18.868 --> 02:20.567
Okay, kids.
Let's go back to work.

02:20.601 --> 02:22.600
I know he has money
here somewhere.

02:22.634 --> 02:25.134
Now, who wants to check
his underwear drawer?

02:27.767 --> 02:30.066
All right.
I'll check his underwear.

02:30.100 --> 02:32.834
After all,
he has only one pair.

02:33.701 --> 02:35.166
Now, Bud,
you take the closet.

02:35.200 --> 02:37.333
Appropriate
for you, Bud.

02:37.367 --> 02:40.066
And, Kelly, honey, you take
the back seat of the car.

02:40.100 --> 02:43.066
Appropriate
for you, Kel.

02:43.100 --> 02:44.800
All right.

02:44.834 --> 02:48.034
Whoa, money!

03:29.734 --> 03:31.234
Hi, Dad.

03:34.501 --> 03:37.334
Save the effort
for the bathroom, Dad.

03:37.968 --> 03:40.066
I saw the money.

03:40.100 --> 03:42.166
Pretty crafty hiding it
in the one place

03:42.200 --> 03:44.500
that even Mom has always
feared to tread.

03:45.801 --> 03:47.166
It's not what you think.

03:47.200 --> 03:50.167
Oh, then, you're not gonna
go somewhere without us?

03:50.701 --> 03:53.301
Well, then, it is
what you think.

03:54.133 --> 03:55.800
But, son...

03:55.834 --> 03:58.533
I'm going to
a shoe convention.

03:59.634 --> 04:01.800
I thought after
your failed, beer-induced

04:01.834 --> 04:03.433
"shoe d'état"
back in '87,

04:03.467 --> 04:05.834
you were barred from
the conventions for life.

04:05.868 --> 04:07.633
I was.

04:07.667 --> 04:09.300
But Jim Thompson wasn't.

04:09.334 --> 04:11.333
And that's my new name.

04:11.367 --> 04:12.934
Uh, Dad--

04:12.968 --> 04:14.533
Uh-- Call me Jim.

04:16.100 --> 04:17.867
Jim, uh...

04:17.901 --> 04:20.233
Surely even a dull man
has asked himself,

04:20.267 --> 04:22.433
"Why would anyone wanna
go to a shoe convention?"

04:22.467 --> 04:24.733
To stay on the cutting edge
of the shoe business, son.

04:24.767 --> 04:26.567
To exchange
shoe information.

04:26.601 --> 04:28.900
To find out
new shoe technology.

04:30.567 --> 04:33.401
To bounce shoe groupies
on my knee.

04:35.667 --> 04:36.934
And more importantly--

04:36.968 --> 04:39.400
and this is something you must
never, ever tell your mother

04:39.434 --> 04:40.867
-- this year, it's in L.A.

04:40.901 --> 04:42.700
L.A.?

04:42.734 --> 04:47.234
Home of Hollywood, sunshine,
and huge, man-made hooters?

04:49.234 --> 04:52.900
And-- And let's not forget
their world-famous shoe stores.

04:54.300 --> 04:57.267
Oh, and what about
the city's culture?

05:00.934 --> 05:03.266
I've been saving up
all my money.

05:03.300 --> 05:05.201
Oh, look what
I already bought.

05:06.234 --> 05:08.101
"Producer."

05:09.467 --> 05:10.733
I'm gonna-- I'm
gonna put it

05:10.767 --> 05:13.468
on the front of the old Dodge
to trick the chicks.

05:14.100 --> 05:15.133
Now, son.

05:15.167 --> 05:18.033
Remember...you must
not utter a word

05:18.067 --> 05:20.301
to any member
of the family.

05:21.367 --> 05:22.366
I swear, Dad.

05:22.400 --> 05:23.999
When do we leave?

05:24.033 --> 05:25.567
We, son? Well--

05:25.601 --> 05:27.999
I seek fun,
I go alone.

05:28.033 --> 05:29.500
Now, remember, son,

05:29.534 --> 05:31.834
you're the man
of the house now.

05:31.868 --> 05:33.333
And remember...

05:33.367 --> 05:36.134
silence for
the brotherhood of men.

05:37.901 --> 05:39.133
Mom, Dad has
money!

05:39.167 --> 05:41.334
He's planning to
spend it without us!

05:43.267 --> 05:45.867
I knew it.
I knew it!

05:45.901 --> 05:47.233
The bacon
never lies.

05:47.267 --> 05:49.166
Yes. He's going
to L.A.

05:49.200 --> 05:50.467
L.A.?

05:50.501 --> 05:53.234
We're going
to Long Island?

05:54.300 --> 05:55.934
No, honey.

05:55.968 --> 05:57.567
It's Los Angeles
we're going to!

05:57.601 --> 05:58.900
We're going to
Los Angeles!

05:58.934 --> 06:01.533
No, you're not.
I'm going alone.

06:01.567 --> 06:02.966
Can we drop in on Hef?

06:03.000 --> 06:03.966
No!

06:04.000 --> 06:05.266
Can we go to
Garfield's house?

06:05.300 --> 06:06.633
No!

06:06.667 --> 06:10.266
Oh, Al, can I buy a bra
at Frederick's of Hollywood?

06:10.300 --> 06:12.334
Hell, no!

06:14.300 --> 06:15.999
Now, hear me, all of you.

06:16.033 --> 06:17.500
I'm going alone.

06:17.534 --> 06:19.999
You can scream,
you can cry.

06:20.033 --> 06:22.001
Peg, you can threaten me
with sex.

06:29.100 --> 06:30.600
You're not going.

06:30.634 --> 06:34.167
<i>I, Jim Thompson,
have spoken.</i>

06:35.767 --> 06:37.934
* 99 bottles of beer
On the wall *

06:37.968 --> 06:39.600
* 99 bottles of beer *

06:39.634 --> 06:41.633
* You take one down
You pass it around *

06:41.667 --> 06:43.099
* 98 bottles of beer
On the wall *

06:43.133 --> 06:45.033
Beautiful country, isn't it?

06:45.067 --> 06:47.667
* 98 bottles of beer... *

06:49.067 --> 06:51.767
It smells in this car.

06:52.701 --> 06:54.567
That's America
you're smelling, kids.

06:54.601 --> 06:56.667
Just look
at its majesty.

06:56.701 --> 06:59.066
* Toodle-lumma-lumma
Toodle-lumma-lumma *

06:59.100 --> 07:00.733
* Toodle-ee-ay *

07:00.767 --> 07:04.700
* I picked my bananas
All along the way *

07:04.734 --> 07:08.233
* Singing toodle-lumma-lumma
Toodle-ee-ay *

07:08.267 --> 07:10.767
Daddy, are we there yet?

07:10.801 --> 07:13.600
Don't bother your father
while he's driving, Kelly.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.567
Are we, Al?

07:15.601 --> 07:17.434
Al, wake up!

07:18.300 --> 07:19.733
* 99 bottles of beer *

07:19.767 --> 07:20.834
* Pass it along-- 98-- *

07:20.868 --> 07:23.034
Where are we?

07:32.167 --> 07:35.600
Chill in the air,
eh, Zeke?

07:35.634 --> 07:39.134
<i>I thought
you were Zeke.</i>

07:43.634 --> 07:46.067
Maybe I am.

07:47.834 --> 07:51.567
Go on inside
and sauté us up a varmint.

07:53.868 --> 07:55.366
Hey, look.

07:55.400 --> 07:58.366
There's something
you don't see every day:

07:58.400 --> 08:00.167
people.

08:03.200 --> 08:04.300
Are we alive?

08:04.334 --> 08:06.233
Ah, what do I know?

08:06.267 --> 08:08.366
Last thing I know,
we're on Route 666,

08:08.400 --> 08:10.867
and now we got
a broken axle on our car.

08:10.901 --> 08:12.999
Nice driving,
pumpkin.

08:13.033 --> 08:14.867
It was not my fault.

08:14.901 --> 08:16.800
I saw a sign
that said "dip,"

08:16.834 --> 08:20.001
so naturally,
I looked at Bud...
Oh.

08:20.634 --> 08:23.233
The next thing I knew,
we were airborne.

08:23.267 --> 08:25.034
Look, Al.

08:26.067 --> 08:27.433
Seems like
we happened upon

08:27.467 --> 08:30.633
a shoe salesman
convention after all.

08:30.667 --> 08:33.133
All right. All right,
let me handle this.

08:33.167 --> 08:36.933
Uh, excuse me,
Six Tooth... Uh...

08:38.801 --> 08:40.600
You know where I can
get a car fixed?

08:40.634 --> 08:44.300
Gas station,
I reckon.

08:44.334 --> 08:46.133
Is there one
around here?

08:46.167 --> 08:48.500
Oh, yeah.
You just can't see it

08:48.534 --> 08:50.934
for the hurly-burly
of the traffic.

08:50.968 --> 08:53.201
But it's right across
the street.

08:59.667 --> 09:01.200
Peg, why don't you
do the talking?

09:01.234 --> 09:02.467
They speak
your language.

09:02.501 --> 09:04.733
They're like
your relatives.

09:04.767 --> 09:06.166
Look, gentlemen.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.433
There is a cool 25 cents
in it for you

09:08.467 --> 09:11.500
if you can haul
our car to a station.

09:11.534 --> 09:15.500
Well...normally
it would be $400.

09:15.534 --> 09:17.867
But we'll do it
for 200

09:17.901 --> 09:20.133
if you let us
take our picture with you,

09:20.167 --> 09:22.167
<i>leopardwoman.</i>

09:24.367 --> 09:26.233
Oh, Al.

09:26.267 --> 09:28.233
The rubes
think I'm sexy.

09:28.267 --> 09:29.233
Yeah.

09:29.267 --> 09:30.700
Yeah,
I would too, Peg,

09:30.734 --> 09:33.434
if I drank whiskey
for breakfast.

09:38.467 --> 09:40.300
How much money we got?

09:40.334 --> 09:41.366
Cash or in the bank?

09:41.400 --> 09:42.467
Either.

09:42.501 --> 09:44.066
Including
the traveler's checks?

09:44.100 --> 09:45.066
Yes.

09:45.100 --> 09:46.834
Five dollars.

09:46.868 --> 09:48.633
Five dollars?

09:48.667 --> 09:50.266
Where'd the rest
of my money go?

09:50.300 --> 09:52.966
Well...I guess one of us
shouldn't have stopped

09:53.000 --> 09:54.533
at Oklahoma Nude.

09:54.567 --> 09:57.333
Oh, pardon me
for seeing America.

09:57.367 --> 09:59.200
Well, I guess the only thing
left for us to do

09:59.234 --> 10:01.533
is to wire Marcie and tell her
we need some more money.

10:01.567 --> 10:03.366
She may not take
too kindly to that though,

10:03.400 --> 10:05.233
since we borrowed
her tires late last night

10:05.267 --> 10:06.433
while she was sleeping.

10:06.467 --> 10:08.667
Just tell her the kids
are sick and near death.

10:08.701 --> 10:10.099
Come on.

10:10.133 --> 10:12.900
Daddy, we are
dying of thirst.

10:12.934 --> 10:14.567
Buy some pop.

10:14.601 --> 10:15.733
All right.

10:15.767 --> 10:18.334
Look at this. A nickel.

10:19.300 --> 10:21.967
How do these rubes
make any money?

10:23.133 --> 10:25.034
Let's see.

10:28.367 --> 10:30.667
I don't see
any bottle opener.

10:30.701 --> 10:34.700
You will,
when we see $5.

10:36.367 --> 10:38.733
Five dollars for
a bottle opener?

10:38.767 --> 10:40.533
You people
are crooks.

10:40.567 --> 10:41.834
Yep.

10:41.868 --> 10:44.533
But we ain't thirsty.

10:47.767 --> 10:49.767
Aw, here
you go.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.700
Aw, kids,
this was a...

10:54.901 --> 10:55.867
A good idea.

10:55.901 --> 10:57.966
God, it's hot.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.267
Mm-hm.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.800
Ah!

11:08.834 --> 11:10.467
Oh, that's good.

11:10.501 --> 11:12.067
Ah.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.233
Well, Marcie's money ought to
be here any minute now.

11:15.267 --> 11:16.533
Oh. Let me
get these shoes off.

11:16.567 --> 11:19.401
Get these dogs out.

11:40.968 --> 11:42.767
Thank you.

11:45.367 --> 11:47.400
Uh...

11:47.434 --> 11:50.201
Have you considered
our proposal?

11:51.000 --> 11:53.867
I couldn't possibly
marry you all.

11:53.901 --> 11:56.800
<i>We didn't say marry.</i>

11:58.200 --> 12:00.900
You wouldn't survive
one night.

12:00.934 --> 12:03.468
Guess not.

12:08.334 --> 12:11.467
Hey. Nice catch there,
Young Zeke.

12:11.501 --> 12:16.201
Yep. But he killed
his better with his feet.

12:17.334 --> 12:19.434
Well, uh...

12:20.868 --> 12:24.101
What do you do around here
for fun, ZZ Tops?

12:39.901 --> 12:41.333
All right,
Kelly. Kelly.

12:41.367 --> 12:42.433
Hold it--
Hold it there.

12:42.467 --> 12:43.500
All right.

12:43.534 --> 12:45.300
All right, partners,
you wanna see more,

12:45.334 --> 12:48.201
put another
nickel in.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.200
Can we have
the little boy

12:52.234 --> 12:54.033
stand on his head
some more?

12:54.067 --> 12:56.533
I can't get
enough of that.

12:56.567 --> 12:59.467
Well, the boy's
a little dizzy, so, uh...

12:59.501 --> 13:02.400
I'm gonna have to
up the price to a dime.

13:02.434 --> 13:04.101
Well...

13:04.901 --> 13:06.967
Bud, go ahead.

13:15.901 --> 13:18.433
That was only worth
a nickel.

13:18.467 --> 13:22.233
But you have the girl there
shake her behind again,

13:22.267 --> 13:24.233
and we'll call it even.

13:24.267 --> 13:25.366
Kelly.

13:25.400 --> 13:28.734
Daddy, I have heat probation.

13:30.701 --> 13:32.667
When is Marcie gonna
wire us the money?

13:32.701 --> 13:34.734
It's been seven hours.

13:35.934 --> 13:37.033
Howdy, Zeke.

13:37.067 --> 13:38.667
Hi.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.333
Well, just made
the last trip

13:41.367 --> 13:44.001
I'm ever gonna take
to that mine.

13:45.467 --> 13:46.934
Got plenty of money.

13:46.968 --> 13:50.867
All I needs now is a car
to get me to the big city.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.934
<i>Hey, $6 million enough
for a good city woman?</i>

13:55.968 --> 13:57.700
Barely.

13:58.334 --> 14:00.233
Ow, I-- I--

14:00.267 --> 14:01.700
I got a rock
in my shoe.

14:01.734 --> 14:04.967
Damn nuggets
are everywhere.

14:06.200 --> 14:08.667
Hey, that looks like
real gold.

14:08.701 --> 14:10.300
Watch it, now!

14:10.334 --> 14:13.200
Anybody here want to
take this here mine

14:13.234 --> 14:15.300
off my hands?

14:15.334 --> 14:17.266
How about you,
Young Zeke?

14:17.300 --> 14:19.333
Not me.

14:19.367 --> 14:22.734
Accountant says I got to curtail
my spending this quarter.

14:25.133 --> 14:26.433
How about you, Zeke?

14:26.467 --> 14:27.999
Not me.

14:28.033 --> 14:29.333
Bad back.

14:29.367 --> 14:31.966
Can't bend over
and pick up gold anymore.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.733
That's why I got
this here bottle opener.

14:35.767 --> 14:40.166
Besides, I ain't
got a car to trade you.

14:40.200 --> 14:41.300
Daddy, we have a car.

14:41.334 --> 14:42.700
Shh! Don't look
too anxious.

14:42.734 --> 14:44.700
Dad, Dad, what
if it's a scam?

14:45.534 --> 14:48.267
Only one way
to find out.

14:55.868 --> 14:57.533
Gold!

15:01.467 --> 15:02.733
Listen, mister...

15:02.767 --> 15:05.333
all I got is the car, the kids
and the wife on my back.

15:05.367 --> 15:07.099
Please, what do you say?
You wanna sell?

15:07.133 --> 15:09.999
Well, I don't know.
You look like a nice fella.

15:10.033 --> 15:12.467
Gold would just
ruin your life.

15:12.501 --> 15:14.366
And you've already
got it all.

15:14.400 --> 15:16.900
A wife, kids...

15:17.601 --> 15:20.099
Must have more than this.

15:20.133 --> 15:23.300
Besides, you don't know
what gold does to a man's soul.

15:23.334 --> 15:25.300
It-- I-it turns families
into mobs.

15:25.334 --> 15:27.300
I- It brings hatred
and violence.

15:27.334 --> 15:31.500
Turns brother against sister,
and husband agin wife.

15:31.534 --> 15:33.200
So i-it'd be just like
my life now,

15:33.234 --> 15:34.900
except I'd have gold
in both fists,

15:34.934 --> 15:37.467
and I'd be saying,
"Yippee, yippee."

15:37.501 --> 15:40.066
Well. All right.

15:40.100 --> 15:41.600
Like my daddy
used to say,

15:41.634 --> 15:42.999
"You can lead a horse
to water,

15:43.033 --> 15:44.633
but you know
he'll make a mess."

15:44.667 --> 15:46.433
What does that mean?

15:46.467 --> 15:48.533
It means...

15:48.567 --> 15:50.800
a horse is a horse,
of course, of course,

15:50.834 --> 15:53.867
but no one should drink
with a horse, of course.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.600
Well, a couple of years
in them mountains,

15:58.634 --> 16:01.234
you'll be laughing
yourtuckusesoff at that one.

16:01.968 --> 16:04.066
Uh, Kelly, give
the nice man

16:04.100 --> 16:05.867
Daddy's car keys.

16:06.834 --> 16:08.333
It's the Dodge
parked out back

16:08.367 --> 16:10.333
with "producer"
on the license plate,

16:10.367 --> 16:14.334
and an odometer that
reads 7 million miles.

16:15.167 --> 16:17.133
Dodge is
a damn fine car.

16:17.167 --> 16:21.034
Ran over my wife
with a Dodge.

16:26.934 --> 16:27.900
Well, I could
always

16:27.934 --> 16:29.233
buy a new Dodge
for that.

16:29.267 --> 16:31.133
Come on, kids,
let's pick some gold!

16:31.167 --> 16:32.567
Yes!

16:32.601 --> 16:34.234
No, wait. Wait!

16:34.601 --> 16:35.800
Wait, son!

16:35.834 --> 16:39.266
You need mules and-- And picks.
And guns for bandits.

16:39.300 --> 16:42.034
And a horse,
of course, of course.

16:42.567 --> 16:45.200
You don't see
the humor, son?

16:45.234 --> 16:46.934
Well, you're gonna
need supplies,

16:46.968 --> 16:49.368
and it's gonna
take money.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.800
Uh-oh. It's Marcy
getting out of her cab.

16:57.367 --> 16:59.133
Uh-- Kids,
cripple up.

16:59.167 --> 17:01.067
Al, die.

17:06.032 --> 17:07.934
Oh, Peg. Peggy, we came
as fast as we could.

17:07.968 --> 17:09.633
Are the children
all right?

17:09.666 --> 17:11.934
Gee, I-- I thought you were
gonna wire the money.

17:11.968 --> 17:14.366
Well, we decided we should come
in case you needed help.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.333
Yeah, but you did
bring the money, didn't you?

17:16.367 --> 17:18.200
Yes, yes,
it's right here.

17:18.233 --> 17:20.467
Oh, my God.

17:20.501 --> 17:22.567
Poor Al.

17:22.601 --> 17:24.965
Look, he's decomposing
already--

17:25.000 --> 17:26.599
Gimme that!

17:27.534 --> 17:30.066
He's alive!
It's a miracle!

17:30.100 --> 17:32.066
No, no. A miracle
would be like--

17:32.100 --> 17:35.567
Like finding a rock
shaped like Ricky Schroder.

17:37.100 --> 17:39.900
You mean to tell me
your kids aren't even hurt?

17:39.934 --> 17:41.266
Uh, well, growing up
like this,

17:41.300 --> 17:43.900
you can't exactly say
we're healthy.

17:43.934 --> 17:45.934
Uh, go play
with the Zekes, kids.

17:45.968 --> 17:49.533
How dare you call us
and tell us Al was killed.

17:49.567 --> 17:51.999
The whole neighborhood
was dancing and singing,

17:52.033 --> 17:54.700
* Ding-dong
The shoeman's dead *

17:59.901 --> 18:01.800
It's a cruel hoax,
Peggy.

18:01.834 --> 18:04.867
Why would you
do such a thing? Why? Why?

18:04.901 --> 18:06.834
For gold.
Heh.

18:06.868 --> 18:09.834
Look, Marcie,
a gold nugget.

18:09.868 --> 18:13.600
Oh, don't tell me
you fools have gold fever.

18:14.234 --> 18:16.066
It's the 1990s,
for God's sake.

18:16.100 --> 18:18.133
What kind of idiot
still gets gold fever

18:18.167 --> 18:20.067
in this day and age?

18:20.734 --> 18:22.967
Marcie...

18:23.868 --> 18:25.066
It's real gold.

18:25.100 --> 18:26.567
I love it. I kiss it.

18:26.601 --> 18:28.233
Mwah. I worship it.

18:28.267 --> 18:31.167
And if it'll do me the honor,
I'll marry it.

18:32.334 --> 18:35.333
Oh, gold,
thou art my master.

18:35.367 --> 18:37.667
Command me!

18:43.000 --> 18:45.633
Well, I guess
it's real, all right.

18:45.667 --> 18:46.767
Where'd you get this?

18:46.801 --> 18:49.133
From the man
with the flies.

18:49.167 --> 18:51.468
Yeah. And I got it
off him.

18:52.868 --> 18:54.166
You see,
we bought the mine,

18:54.200 --> 18:56.099
but we don't have enough
money for supplies.

18:56.133 --> 18:57.400
Huh.

18:57.434 --> 18:59.233
Look, uh...

18:59.267 --> 19:01.467
Let me take care
of that. Okay?

19:01.501 --> 19:03.167
Okay.

19:05.501 --> 19:07.267
Whew!

19:36.567 --> 19:39.433
I don't know, old-timer.

19:39.467 --> 19:41.366
You know...

19:41.400 --> 19:45.301
this nugget just doesn't look
like it's worth that much.

19:47.901 --> 19:50.401
It's really worth
a whole lot.

19:53.601 --> 19:56.733
So...how many more are there
up there like this?

19:56.767 --> 19:58.366
Well, there's enough
to keep you

19:58.400 --> 20:01.533
and your little
fella here...

20:04.934 --> 20:08.667
in baseball cards
for the rest of his life.

20:09.567 --> 20:14.468
Get your lice-ridden hands
off me, Festus.

20:16.100 --> 20:18.467
I am his wife.

20:18.501 --> 20:20.366
Oh.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.099
Well, if I'm gonna
go to the big city,

20:22.133 --> 20:25.101
I guess I'd better
get liberal.

20:27.334 --> 20:29.366
So, uh, how much
you asking for

20:29.400 --> 20:31.066
your prospecting
equipment?

20:31.100 --> 20:35.200
<i>Well, $200 and, uh,
the little lady's bracelet.</i>

20:35.234 --> 20:37.133
Oh. That's
my mother's bracelet.

20:37.167 --> 20:38.233
It's
impossible--

20:38.267 --> 20:39.834
It's done.
Done.

20:40.367 --> 20:41.467
All right.

20:41.501 --> 20:43.099
We're rich. Ha-ha.

20:43.133 --> 20:44.667
You're
half-rich.

20:44.701 --> 20:46.500
We got the map,
you got the supplies.

20:46.534 --> 20:49.533
That means, uh...
we're partners, huh?

20:53.267 --> 20:55.099
Partners?

20:55.133 --> 20:56.099
Partners.

20:56.133 --> 20:57.934
Partners.

20:59.200 --> 21:02.166
<i>Well, it looks like the Bundys
and the D'Arcys</i>

21:02.200 --> 21:05.667
<i>are off to them thar hills
to search for gold.</i>

21:05.701 --> 21:07.467
<i>Will Al strike it rich</i>

21:07.501 --> 21:10.233
<i>and finally be able to
afford his own bathroom</i>

21:10.267 --> 21:14.600
<i>with toilet paper as soft
as a mother's kiss?</i>

21:16.601 --> 21:18.233
<i>Will Peggy strike it rich</i>

21:18.267 --> 21:20.733
<i>and be able to get
her own platinum credit card,</i>

21:20.767 --> 21:24.900
<i>carried in the loincloth
of a Nubian god?</i>

21:26.968 --> 21:31.434
<i>Will Jefferson dump Marcie
and elope with his nugget?</i>

21:33.334 --> 21:36.233
<i>Will Marcie ever
be able to detach</i>

21:36.267 --> 21:39.934
<i>Young Zeke's hound dog
from her leg?</i>

21:42.734 --> 21:44.934
<i>Will Kelly trade
all her gold nuggets</i>

21:44.968 --> 21:48.134
<i>for a shiny new nickel?</i>

21:49.968 --> 21:52.734
<i>Will Bud
steal her nickel?</i>

21:56.834 --> 21:59.667
<i>Will anyone find out
Buck had all his friends over</i>

21:59.701 --> 22:01.567
<i>while he had the house
to himself,</i>

22:01.601 --> 22:03.567
<i>and partied till he puked?</i>

22:03.601 --> 22:05.633
<i>We'll find out next week</i>

22:05.667 --> 22:08.700
