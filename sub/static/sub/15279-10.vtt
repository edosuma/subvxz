No. That son of a bitch

a steady paycheck and a cushy job,

You caught him lying.

22:36.981 --> 22:39.150
Mm-hm. Yeah.

catch people lying.

32:02.296 --> 32:04.173
- Are the kids home?
- No.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.467
- Where's John? John?
- Why, what's wrong?

32:06.550 --> 32:07.677
What's going on?

32:08.594 --> 32:11.138
What is this nonsense
about you telling Ben and Janey

32:11.221 --> 32:13.766
to stay away from their uncle?

32:13.932 --> 32:17.394
- Sally, why don't you sit down?
- I don't wanna sit down.

32:20.815 --> 32:24.861
- Danny's got himself into something, Mom.
- What is that supposed to mean?

32:24.943 --> 32:28.405
He's involved in something where
he's gonna get into a lot of trouble.

32:28.906 --> 32:31.200
Oh, did you catch him smoking grass?

32:31.367 --> 32:33.285
Because, you know,
he smoked some with me.

32:33.369 --> 32:35.746
That's not the issue, Sally.

32:39.917 --> 32:43.713
- He's been lying to you, lying to me--
- About what?

32:45.589 --> 32:47.216
I can't go into details about it.

32:47.299 --> 32:48.926
What did he do? Did he--?

32:49.009 --> 32:52.179
Did he rob a bank? Did he kill someone?
What are you accusing him of?

32:52.262 --> 32:53.764
There's a lot of moving pieces.

32:53.848 --> 32:55.974
- You'll just have to trust me on this.
- No.

32:56.141 --> 33:00.270
He has finally turned his life around
and we are not gonna fuck it up.

33:00.437 --> 33:02.606
- He's gotta be held accountable.
- So do you.

33:03.900 --> 33:05.568
And so do you.

33:06.985 --> 33:12.074
This goddamn family is gonna have to stop
treating him like an outcast.

33:12.241 --> 33:16.537
Don't make me choose sides,
John, because I will.

33:24.253 --> 33:27.172
[country music playing over speakers]

33:28.716 --> 33:30.718
[people chattering]

33:34.889 --> 33:36.974
Sorry I'm late.

33:37.892 --> 33:41.019
Patient had a seizure
ten minutes before my shift ended.

33:41.103 --> 33:44.189
- Inconsiderate asshole.
- Right?

33:44.273 --> 33:47.276
Hey, let me send this back.
Get you some fresh ones.

33:47.359 --> 33:50.153
No. No, I'm good. It's fine.

33:53.616 --> 33:55.284
Hey.

33:55.618 --> 33:57.035
So, uh...

33:59.455 --> 34:02.458
seeing your mom
really brought back memories.

34:05.002 --> 34:07.463
I wanted to talk to you about that.

34:08.255 --> 34:10.549
She told me you stopped by.

34:12.551 --> 34:14.219
Yeah, I--

34:14.595 --> 34:16.513
I thought I could help out with the rent.

34:16.680 --> 34:19.683
Rent, and then some.

34:20.017 --> 34:23.479
Look, it's really generous,
but she's not your responsibility.

34:25.856 --> 34:26.857
Is she yours?

34:26.941 --> 34:29.819
Because I remember growing up,
she was horrible to you two.

34:29.986 --> 34:32.195
Yeah, no argument there.

34:33.864 --> 34:35.992
Then why are you doing it?

34:38.702 --> 34:40.830
I mean, look at her.

34:42.039 --> 34:44.500
Does my mother look happy to you?

34:44.583 --> 34:46.836
She had a shitty life and she's miserable.

34:47.003 --> 34:49.087
Exactly.

34:49.171 --> 34:52.675
So, what's that got to do with you?

34:55.678 --> 34:57.888
She tried.

34:59.139 --> 35:04.227
And if you-- If you give someone control
over your happiness, you're fucked.

35:07.523 --> 35:09.399
Which is why I can't accept this.

35:17.033 --> 35:21.037
- Where'd you get all that loot, anyway?
- Just working at the inn.

35:23.121 --> 35:25.123
No way.

35:28.335 --> 35:31.338
Well, my dad left me some money.

35:33.382 --> 35:37.135
I'm sorry.
I can't go down that road again.

35:37.553 --> 35:39.346
What road?

35:40.890 --> 35:43.350
The one I went down with my brother.

35:43.433 --> 35:45.102
With my ex-husband.

35:48.064 --> 35:50.900
I can't be with you
if you're heading for trouble.

35:52.568 --> 35:55.571
No, you don't have to worry about that.

35:58.532 --> 36:00.784
[Clay] Our contact tells us
Lowry's next shipment

36:00.868 --> 36:03.328
is headed here in the next 48 hours.

36:03.412 --> 36:05.247
[Marco] Know where
they're touching down?

36:05.330 --> 36:08.500
No, but we're fairly certain
Quintana will lay hands on it.

36:08.584 --> 36:11.837
Apparently, Lowry uses him
to move his product up north.

36:11.921 --> 36:15.298
Sand-fuck of it is,
we don't have enough intel.

36:15.382 --> 36:18.427
Our orders are
to let Quintana make the pickup

36:18.510 --> 36:19.845
and stop him in transit.

36:21.638 --> 36:24.725
Then we'll use him
to take down everyone else.

36:30.147 --> 36:33.358
[John] The DEA
is gonna bring some guy in...

36:34.317 --> 36:36.236
and they're gonna flip him.

36:38.697 --> 36:41.366
Danny's gonna get caught up in it.

36:42.367 --> 36:44.411
When's that gonna happen?

36:48.165 --> 36:50.167
Couple days.

37:01.845 --> 37:04.056
How are you doing with all of this?

37:06.850 --> 37:08.685
I'm fine.

37:09.979 --> 37:12.773
I just want him out of my life.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.111
[sighs]

37:21.323 --> 37:24.576
Hey. He did this to himself.
Don't feel sorry for him.

37:24.660 --> 37:26.078
Oh, I don't.

37:28.205 --> 37:31.041
I was thinking about your mom.

37:32.668 --> 37:34.753
You should tell her.

37:38.632 --> 37:40.050
[door opens]

37:41.135 --> 37:42.302
[door closes]

37:42.385 --> 37:46.598
[Danny] You can't deal with--
That's it, then you never leave--

37:48.809 --> 37:51.103
- [Chelsea] Hey, Kevin.
- Hey.

37:56.108 --> 37:58.443
Sorry to hear what happened to you
at the boatyard.

37:58.568 --> 38:01.363
- I'm fine. It was no big deal.
- [Danny] Don't worry about it.

38:01.530 --> 38:04.658
You can't hurt this guy.
He's made of Rayburn. Right?

38:07.786 --> 38:09.287
I'll come back when you're done.

38:09.371 --> 38:11.581
- Yeah. Okay.
- [Chelsea] Okay.

38:12.958 --> 38:14.210
I'll call you.

38:14.376 --> 38:16.503
I won't be too long.

38:17.921 --> 38:18.964
[sighs]

38:19.840 --> 38:21.299
[Danny] Oh, my God.

38:23.677 --> 38:25.428
She's something else, huh?

38:27.097 --> 38:29.307
How long have you guys been...?

38:30.559 --> 38:31.977
Uh...

38:33.229 --> 38:37.274
Ever since I found out
how she can demolish a cock.

38:39.985 --> 38:42.905
But you already knew that, right?

38:44.114 --> 38:48.869
Fuck off, man. Come on, I was wasted.
I don't even remember it.

38:51.329 --> 38:53.331
Come on, man.

38:53.415 --> 38:56.543
- We're... Eskimo brothers.
- [Kevin chuckles]

38:56.626 --> 38:58.295
Right? Isn't that what they call it?

38:58.378 --> 39:00.714
- Cooter cousins. Pussy pals.
- Fuck off.

39:01.381 --> 39:02.758
Hey.

39:02.925 --> 39:05.969
I just think it's funny that, uh...

39:07.637 --> 39:10.057
you sent a load
up the same highway that I did.

39:10.140 --> 39:13.269
Unless you took a detour.
Did you take a detour?

39:13.769 --> 39:15.771
[♪♪♪]

39:17.731 --> 39:22.736
Do you know that sometimes
I ask her to call me Kevin?

39:22.903 --> 39:27.283
It makes me so fucking hard that you and I
finally have something in common.

39:35.749 --> 39:37.167
[sighs]

39:39.753 --> 39:41.338
[John]
Mom.

39:41.630 --> 39:42.631
Hey, honey.

39:46.635 --> 39:48.595
Hey. I need to talk to you.

39:49.096 --> 39:52.975
I know. I'm sorry about the other night.
I owe you and Diana an apology.

39:53.058 --> 39:56.853
No. It's not about that. It's about Danny.

39:57.813 --> 40:00.565
Oh, it's always about Danny.

40:01.650 --> 40:02.985
Sit down.

40:10.326 --> 40:12.369
I don't know what you remember

40:12.452 --> 40:17.457
from around the time that we lost Sarah.

40:21.253 --> 40:23.046
A little bit.

40:25.215 --> 40:28.302
Your father and I were having a rough go.

40:31.263 --> 40:34.557
Raising five children, running this place.

40:34.641 --> 40:37.186
We weren't getting along.

40:37.727 --> 40:39.938
It was a struggle.

40:42.149 --> 40:48.071
Seems crazy now, but at the time
it seemed like I had no other choice.

40:49.072 --> 40:51.033
No other choice about what?

40:52.368 --> 40:54.328
[♪♪♪]

40:54.411 --> 40:56.496
[Sally]
About leaving.

40:58.207 --> 41:00.959
I left your father, John.

41:04.671 --> 41:06.173
And the day I left...

41:11.261 --> 41:13.805
I don't know. [sighs]

41:13.889 --> 41:16.725
Oh, Sarah must've heard us
fighting on the phone.

41:18.310 --> 41:22.856
I didn't hold her,
I didn't try to comfort her.

41:26.235 --> 41:30.364
I told Danny to take her.

41:40.374 --> 41:42.418
And I left.

41:48.424 --> 41:51.760
Then he took her out in the boat...

41:53.053 --> 41:55.638
and his whole life fell apart.

41:57.266 --> 41:58.434
Because of me.

42:08.318 --> 42:11.654
I can never forgive myself, John.

42:12.072 --> 42:13.949
But I can try to make it up to him.

42:14.824 --> 42:16.826
He's got a job.

42:17.202 --> 42:19.413
He's got a girlfriend.

42:21.123 --> 42:26.420
Despite everything,
he may have found some joy in his life.

42:28.171 --> 42:30.799
I'm holding my breath.

42:33.843 --> 42:39.808
For the first time in his life,
I think maybe he's gonna be okay.

42:52.028 --> 42:54.030
[♪♪♪]

43:05.417 --> 43:08.795
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

43:21.183 --> 43:23.101
Fuck.

43:30.108 --> 43:32.235
Fuck you.

43:43.997 --> 43:45.665
Hey.

43:47.876 --> 43:50.795
Nana's cooking lessons paid off.

43:51.547 --> 43:52.839
[chuckles]

43:54.424 --> 43:56.718
They sure did.

43:57.969 --> 44:01.764
How long was it
Diana and I paid those tuition rates?

44:01.848 --> 44:04.142
Two, three years?

44:05.894 --> 44:09.856
Hey, you want your money back,
I'll write you a check in the morning.

44:11.358 --> 44:13.485
You got some extra cash laying around?

44:14.944 --> 44:16.738
- A little.
- Oh, yeah?

44:16.821 --> 44:18.990
What? Heh.

44:19.199 --> 44:22.202
Wasn't too long ago
you were bitching about your paycheck.

44:22.285 --> 44:27.374
Well... when your mom is the boss,
you do okay.

44:36.883 --> 44:39.928
Except you're not just working with Mom,
are you?

44:40.262 --> 44:43.806
Then who--? Well, who am I working for?

44:43.973 --> 44:46.976
Wayne Lowry. Rafi Quintana.

44:49.354 --> 44:51.940
Can't say I know those names, John.

44:52.023 --> 44:54.150
Listen to me, asshole.

44:54.484 --> 44:56.778
You get one fucking shot at this.

44:56.861 --> 44:58.905
You come clean, you tell me everything.

44:59.072 --> 45:03.159
I talk to the DA,
I fucking try to help cut you a deal.

45:03.326 --> 45:06.746
I know something's going down,
whether you know about it or you don't.

45:06.829 --> 45:09.332
When it happens,
Wayne Lowry's going down with it.

45:09.416 --> 45:12.168
And at that point, do you have any idea
what's gonna happen

45:12.335 --> 45:13.711
to Danny fucking Rayburn?!

45:13.795 --> 45:15.297
I know it's very cold in here--

45:15.380 --> 45:17.757
Do you have any fucking idea
why I'm standing here?!

45:17.840 --> 45:20.636
Why I'm taking the risk
that I'm fucking taking right now?

45:20.802 --> 45:22.345
I can see you're very worked up--

45:22.429 --> 45:24.514
Your friends aren't
just fucking moving drugs.

45:24.598 --> 45:26.057
They're trafficking people.

45:26.224 --> 45:30.520
Your friend. Your friend, Wayne Lowry,
responsible for these two girls' murders.

45:30.604 --> 45:32.439
You see them?

45:33.022 --> 45:35.817
Look at them. Fucking look at them.

45:50.123 --> 45:54.377
You come in, I'll try to protect you.
This is your last chance.

45:58.131 --> 46:00.467
After that, you're on your own.

46:15.315 --> 46:18.234
[♪♪♪]

46:44.302 --> 46:48.306
- [Rafi] Things cool on your end?
- Yeah. Just say the word.

46:48.848 --> 46:51.100
Good. We'll move this shit tomorrow.

46:51.184 --> 46:53.478
Noon. Make sure your guy's
at the gas station.

46:53.645 --> 46:55.397
Oh, he'll be there.

47:01.194 --> 47:04.447
You know, you keep doing right,
and there'll be more in this for you.

47:04.864 --> 47:05.907
More is good.

47:06.074 --> 47:09.035
Sí, hermano, more is more fucking good.

47:10.495 --> 47:13.248
What else you guys got going on?

47:13.831 --> 47:15.584
What else?

47:16.418 --> 47:18.044
Got a good setup.

47:18.127 --> 47:20.714
Seems a shame
not to use it for other things.

47:21.089 --> 47:22.090
Like what?

47:23.007 --> 47:25.093
- Weapons.
- No. Fuck, no.

47:25.260 --> 47:27.387
Those weapon dudes
are lowlife scumbags.

47:28.930 --> 47:31.099
- People.
- People?

47:32.225 --> 47:33.893
No.

47:35.061 --> 47:36.688
Not anymore.

47:39.274 --> 47:40.942
Why not?

47:41.109 --> 47:43.361

- Yeah.
- [Rafi] They may have been spotted.

There's no sign of anyone.

48:08.595 --> 48:11.222
You take the cargo,
then I'll dump the boat.

48:14.476 --> 48:16.728
Get rid of them.

48:19.981 --> 48:21.983
We don't have to do that. Please.

48:22.525 --> 48:24.694
We don't have to.

48:25.069 --> 48:27.322
Get rid of them.

48:27.489 --> 48:29.574
Understood?

48:30.742 --> 48:32.243
Yeah.

48:32.535 --> 48:34.329
Understood.

It was a fucking shit storm, bro.

49:06.361 --> 49:08.237
So you stopped?

49:09.865 --> 49:12.784
Yeah. It's not worth it.

49:12.992 --> 49:15.745
We got a good thing. Be happy with it.

49:19.791 --> 49:24.379
Yeah, you're right.
I gotta learn to be happy with what I got.

49:26.422 --> 49:29.175
Right. Tomorrow, then.

Hey, I've got some catalogs for you.

50:20.602 --> 50:23.271
- Catalogs? For what?
- Oh...

50:23.688 --> 50:25.732
Bridal gowns.

50:27.275 --> 50:31.947
I thought we could start looking in Miami
this weekend and make a day out of it.

50:32.029 --> 50:35.408
Oh, you know, Mom,
everything's so hectic right now.

50:35.575 --> 50:38.244
Maybe we can check in
at the end of the week.

50:38.327 --> 50:40.413
Oh, yeah, sure.

50:40.496 --> 50:41.664
Look, I know you're busy,

50:41.748 --> 50:45.293
but did you have a chance
to file those new ownership documents?

50:46.002 --> 50:47.128
For the inn?

50:47.295 --> 50:49.422
Yeah. To include Danny.

50:51.424 --> 50:53.635
No, I didn't.

50:54.803 --> 50:59.348
- Why not? Thought we all agreed to sign.
- I changed my mind.

51:00.516 --> 51:01.935
What are you talking about?

51:02.393 --> 51:04.562
I know you're happy
with what he's doing here,

51:04.646 --> 51:07.607
and I'm willing to give him a chance,
but it's too soon.

51:07.774 --> 51:10.652
What? Wh--? This is not like you, Meg.

51:10.819 --> 51:13.780
Originally I agreed to go along
with everybody else's decision.

51:13.863 --> 51:16.532
- But I'm entitled to my own opinion.
- Of course you are.

51:16.616 --> 51:18.534
I'm not signing it. I'm not comfortable.

51:18.701 --> 51:22.163
I just don't understand
why you're doing this.

51:23.873 --> 51:25.708
Meg.

51:27.418 --> 51:31.506

54:16.838 --> 54:19.256
I'll try and cut a deal,

And, uh, we went out
and we stole the gas and...

55:09.098 --> 55:11.017
What'd you do with the gas?

55:11.893 --> 55:13.853
Uh, we took it out to the mangroves.

to the bait and tackle shop.

57:07.342 --> 57:09.885
So you went to Lowry,
Lowry didn't go to you.

Yeah, it was all me.

Rafi Quintana paid him 200 bucks
to take his car

58:18.120 --> 58:20.539
and drive it to an address
in Homestead.

58:20.622 --> 58:24.043

doesn't exist.
