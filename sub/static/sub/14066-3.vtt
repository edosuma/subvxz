<i>Previously on Boston Legal…</i>

00:01.859 --> 00:03.600
This was just assigned to us
by the court.

00:03.640 --> 00:06.100
Indigent client: old lawyer
jumped in front of a bus.

00:06.140 --> 00:07.420
Now he needs a new one.

00:07.460 --> 00:08.990
I've hired another associate.

00:09.030 --> 00:10.060
Hello, Alan.

00:10.070 --> 00:10.810
Still looking well.

00:10.850 --> 00:12.000
We can't do this.

00:12.010 --> 00:12.990
Never.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.120
You and I should not be
doing a case together.

00:17.130 --> 00:18.360
What are you doing in my law firm?

00:18.400 --> 00:20.700
It's not your firm, Denny.
I'm a senior partner.

00:20.740 --> 00:21.760
We had a deal, Sack.

00:21.800 --> 00:24.990
I stay out of New York, you
steer clear of Boston.

00:25.030 --> 00:26.170
Shirley's involved.

00:26.210 --> 00:27.880
Shirley and Carl Sack?

00:27.890 --> 00:28.930
I'd put money on it.

00:28.970 --> 00:30.440
I'd shoot him.

Hello.

00:41.830 --> 00:42.820
Hello.

00:42.830 --> 00:43.990
Hello.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.020
My name is Abigail Holt.

00:46.030 --> 00:47.780
My friends and family call me Abby.

00:47.820 --> 00:49.210
That's a lovely name.

00:49.220 --> 00:50.310
Thank you.

00:50.320 --> 00:51.530
How did you get here?

00:51.570 --> 00:54.710
I walked in. I need to hire a lawyer.

00:54.720 --> 00:56.766
I'd like to sue my high school.

00:59.310 --> 01:02.380
And what would you like to
sue your high school for?

01:02.420 --> 01:04.209
They teach abstinence only.

01:04.220 --> 01:08.230
It's their fault, at least partly,
that I got caught so… uh…

01:09.010 --> 01:10.450
unprepared.

01:10.730 --> 01:12.360
Unprepared?

01:13.400 --> 01:14.820
How old are you?

01:14.830 --> 01:16.350
I'm 15.

01:18.520 --> 01:21.350
And by unprepared
I'm assuming you mean…

01:21.840 --> 01:24.080
you had unprotected sex.

01:24.880 --> 01:26.360
Yes.

01:26.370 --> 01:28.080
Are you pregnant?

01:28.380 --> 01:31.680
I ask only because if you
do plan to take care of it,

01:31.720 --> 01:34.390
you should know abortion is
only legal in this country

01:34.430 --> 01:37.600
until our current supreme court
reaches its third trimester.

01:37.640 --> 01:40.150
I didn't get pregnant, Mr Shore.

01:40.160 --> 01:41.800
I see.

01:41.810 --> 01:46.080
Well, in a lawsuit, one
must show damages, Abby.

01:46.700 --> 01:48.390
Do you have damages?

01:50.730 --> 01:53.380
I'm H.I.V. positive.

01:58.610 --> 02:01.400
First up, the court
in either its infinite wisdom,

02:01.440 --> 02:04.290
or zeal, to suck the private sector

02:04.300 --> 02:08.210
into community service has assigned us
yet another high-profile criminal case.

02:08.250 --> 02:09.100
Do I have any takers?

02:09.139 --> 02:11.080
Denny Crane, giver.

02:11.090 --> 02:14.360
Attaboy, Denny. The client
is charged with cockfighting.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.910
His rooster evidently took the
life of another. Moving on.

02:16.950 --> 02:18.720
No can do.

02:19.130 --> 02:20.710
Why don't you do it?

02:21.600 --> 02:22.470
Me?

02:22.480 --> 02:23.660
Carl.

02:23.670 --> 02:26.270
My problem is…

02:26.280 --> 02:28.190
I like chickens.
–Do you, now?

02:28.230 --> 02:32.160
I find them sweet. And the idea of putting
a poultry killer back on the street…

02:32.200 --> 02:33.440
–Assuming you'd win.
–But I would.

02:33.480 --> 02:34.650
–Your defense?
–No idea.

02:34.690 --> 02:36.530
–You think I'm stupid?
–A much longer discussion.

02:36.570 --> 02:39.450
You want me to take this case
to ruin my perfect record.

02:39.490 --> 02:40.810
You seek to blemish me.

02:40.850 --> 02:42.720
Are you saying
you can't win it, Denny?

02:42.760 --> 02:44.060
–I know you can't.
–All right.

02:44.100 --> 02:46.806
You're probably right.
I'm not much good…

02:47.390 --> 02:48.650
unless there's money on it.

02:48.690 --> 02:51.090
–Oh, no, no.
–How much?

02:51.100 --> 02:51.990
$50,000.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.950
–Why not make it $100,000?
–We could make it $200,000.

02:53.990 --> 02:54.750
$200,000 it is.

02:54.790 --> 02:56.680
Hey! First of all,

02:56.690 --> 02:59.710
wagering on the outcome of a
case is grounds for disbarment.

02:59.750 --> 03:02.150
Both of you should be taken
behind the barn and spanked.

03:02.190 --> 03:03.050
Me first.

03:03.060 --> 03:05.950
And what kind of message does
this send our younger associates,

03:05.990 --> 03:07.970
betting $200,000
on the o—

03:07.980 --> 03:10.090
Shirley, come on. We don't pay
our associates that much money?

03:10.130 --> 03:12.860
$200,000 it is.

03:12.870 --> 03:14.440
It's a bet.

03:17.620 --> 03:19.290
What?

BOSTON LEGAL
Season 04 Episode 03

03:50.440 --> 03:52.580
I brought you in for some maturity.

03:52.620 --> 03:53.580
Big mistake.

03:53.590 --> 03:57.270
Well, if so, I'll correct it. The last
thing I need around here is another child.

03:57.310 --> 03:58.830
Are you pregnant, Shirley?

03:58.870 --> 04:00.210
Shut up, Alan.

04:00.220 --> 04:01.550
Well, now I'm aroused.

04:01.590 --> 04:02.720
Me, too.

04:02.730 --> 04:04.250
You need to go meet with your client.

04:04.290 --> 04:06.480
What about me? I have ears.

04:06.490 --> 04:08.560
Cute ones, actually.

04:08.570 --> 04:10.960
All the better to nibble on, I suppose.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.280
Lorraine…

04:12.290 --> 04:15.690
don't think for a second
that my attraction to you

04:15.700 --> 04:19.130
or my innate lack of professionalism
means I can't keep my hands off you.

04:19.170 --> 04:21.149
Quite the contrary.

04:21.160 --> 04:26.630
I think I've tapped
into a deep reservoir of…

04:27.700 --> 04:32.440
control and discipline
that allows for really…

04:33.450 --> 04:35.570
any proximity.

04:36.580 --> 04:38.120
See?

04:38.130 --> 04:39.540
Nothing.

04:39.550 --> 04:41.420
Nothing?

04:48.830 --> 04:50.340
Dear.

04:53.830 --> 04:55.380
I beg your pardon.

04:55.390 --> 04:56.820
Yes.

04:56.830 --> 04:59.668
Do you know where I
might find Katie Lloyd?

05:12.250 --> 05:15.530
Is he speaking english? That—
that's not english, is it?

05:15.570 --> 05:17.870
My guess would be… spanish.

05:17.880 --> 05:20.250
That's great. You put your
chicken killer on the stand,

05:20.290 --> 05:22.300
let him explain what happened
in his foreign language.

05:22.340 --> 05:24.122
The jury's gonna love that.

05:25.540 --> 05:29.570
–Mr Obisbo. Mr Obisbo!
–Por—

05:30.770 --> 05:33.720
Do you speak any english?

05:33.730 --> 05:35.570
Si, si!

05:42.700 --> 05:44.400
Maybe he knows arab.

05:44.410 --> 05:47.644
Get him to speak little
arab, Carl. That'll work.

06:02.770 --> 06:04.780
Excuse me. Ms Lloyd?

06:04.790 --> 06:06.940
–Yes.
–I'm Deena Rice.

06:06.950 --> 06:07.790
Hello.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.210
This is Jerry Espenson.

06:09.250 --> 06:10.360
–Hello.
–Hello.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.940
Yes, I've seen
you both on television.

06:12.950 --> 06:14.950
I followed the Joseph Washington trial.

06:14.990 --> 06:17.610
My husband used to be
involved in the case.

06:17.650 --> 06:19.550
Oh, really? What?

06:20.380 --> 06:22.200
Rice? Matthew Rice?

06:22.210 --> 06:25.730
My husband represented Joseph Washington
up until he threw himself in front of a bus.

06:25.770 --> 06:27.560
I'm so sorry, Mrs Rice.

06:27.570 --> 06:29.180
Thank you.

06:29.190 --> 06:32.130
You two must be extraordinary attorneys.

06:32.140 --> 06:37.882
He spoke often of Joseph Washington. He made
it sound like a rather impossible defense.

06:38.120 --> 06:41.340
I have a rather…
improbable case of my own.

06:41.350 --> 06:43.700
I was wondering whether you
might consider representing me.

06:43.740 --> 06:45.180
What kind of a case is it?

06:45.220 --> 06:50.236
I'd like to sue the psychologist at
treated my husband prior to his suicide.

06:51.860 --> 06:53.730
Of course you're not
thinking of bringing such a case.

06:53.770 --> 06:55.380
She's a minor. I give you
no authority to go ahead w—

06:55.420 --> 06:56.870
–Dad!
–Listen to me, young lady.

06:56.910 --> 06:59.230
You have no legitimate cause of action.

06:59.270 --> 07:02.850
Not to mention the fact that this kind
of thing would get media attention.

07:02.890 --> 07:05.880
Now do you really want to be
known as “the H.I.V. girl”?

07:05.920 --> 07:08.590
I want to be known as a person
who will stand up for my rights.

07:08.630 --> 07:09.620
Your rights?

07:09.630 --> 07:13.160
Honey, you're the one who decided to
have sex. It's your responsibility.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.910
Which I take, but the
school should also—

07:14.950 --> 07:16.860
Let's just go home, honey.
We can talk about it—

07:16.900 --> 07:18.610
I can get emancipated.

07:18.620 --> 07:19.990
And I can bring this case without you.

07:20.030 --> 07:21.110
No, you cannot.

07:21.120 --> 07:23.020
Well, actually, she can.

07:23.650 --> 07:25.370
What kind of lawyer are you?

07:25.410 --> 07:27.640
The troubled yet fun kind.

07:27.650 --> 07:29.480
Abby, your father's right about this.

07:29.520 --> 07:32.420
Plus, if you bring such a
lawsuit, a great deal of the focus

07:32.460 --> 07:35.390
and media attention will be on
the fact that you have H.I.V.

07:35.430 --> 07:40.314
Along with millions of other people.
I don't consider it much of a stigma.

07:40.830 --> 07:43.300
I know I-I probably won't win.

07:43.310 --> 07:46.610
But somebody has gotta
make some noise about this.

07:46.930 --> 07:48.000
Mr And Mrs Holt—

07:48.010 --> 07:48.860
This is ridiculous.

07:48.900 --> 07:54.180
It's possible in years to come your
daughter would regret bringing this lawsuit.

07:54.890 --> 07:58.620
My sense is, knowing her
for all of, uh, 20 minutes,

07:58.630 --> 08:01.732
she'd regret not bringing
it considerably more.

08:08.140 --> 08:12.020
If you sabotage this case
in any way, the bet is off.

08:12.030 --> 08:13.690
–I would never.
–Denny.

08:13.700 --> 08:17.130
I'm a neutral observer, like
Switzerland. Only with a bigger penis.

08:17.170 --> 08:21.592
I'm just gonna sit back, relax and
enjoy. Promise. Mind if I smoke?

08:22.930 --> 08:25.660
Oh, the, uh, probation report came back.

08:25.670 --> 08:28.670
Seems your client has a record.

08:28.680 --> 08:30.920
He stole a car last year. Awful.

08:33.480 --> 08:36.880
He began seeing Dr Farrell
right after his father died.

08:36.919 --> 08:39.190
Matthew and his dad
were extremely close.

08:39.230 --> 08:42.669
And he found himself completely
devastated by his death.

08:42.710 --> 08:44.049
How long was he treated?

08:44.090 --> 08:47.070
Six months, with some success at first.

08:47.080 --> 08:50.370
But then he regressed
into a profound despair.

08:50.380 --> 08:53.490
So much so that I'm convinced
the therapy did damage.

08:53.530 --> 08:56.540
Did Dr Farrell prescribe any
medication for your husband?

08:56.580 --> 08:59.980
No, it was all
psychotherapy, just talking.

08:59.990 --> 09:03.050
But Matthew suddenly began
to have… “recovered memories”

09:03.090 --> 09:06.560
they call it—
childhood abuse, sexual abuse.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.300
He couldn't handle it.

09:08.340 --> 09:13.070
Well, one might argue that the memories
caused the depression, not the treatment.

09:13.110 --> 09:16.250
But he wouldn't have had the
memories if he hadn't had the treatment.

09:16.290 --> 09:19.240
We all assume that the unearthing
of feelings is a good thing.

09:19.280 --> 09:21.360
But many times, it's not.

09:21.370 --> 09:24.000
I mean, Matthew's repressed
memories weren't hurting him.

09:24.040 --> 09:26.730
He was happy. He was successful.

09:27.750 --> 09:30.310
Once this doctor dug them out…

09:30.800 --> 09:32.780
they killed him.

09:37.550 --> 09:39.380
Denny, ready?

09:39.810 --> 09:41.220
You can't dress him up like that.

09:41.260 --> 09:42.360
Why not?

09:42.370 --> 09:44.050
Because that's not how he looks.

09:44.090 --> 09:47.120
You're committing fraud on the
court, making them think that's how he looks.

09:47.160 --> 09:48.870
Denny, we dress up clients all the time.

09:48.910 --> 09:49.850
–It's not fair.
–Get in.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.250
You're cheating.

09:53.740 --> 09:58.460
Alan, I'm assigning Lorraine to second chair
you on your case against the school board.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.890
What? Why?

10:00.900 --> 10:03.410
This is an issue which touches
on significant women's rights.

10:03.450 --> 10:06.480
I think it makes sense
to have a woman on board.

10:06.520 --> 10:08.040
Her?

10:08.050 --> 10:09.360
Is there a problem?

10:09.370 --> 10:12.670
No, no, no, no. No, not at all.

10:12.680 --> 10:16.110
This is a threshold case, Alan. It's
likely to get a little media play.

10:16.150 --> 10:18.350
I'd just like to have
a woman'face on it.

10:18.390 --> 10:19.400
I couldn't agree more.

10:19.440 --> 10:21.960
So… no problem then?

10:21.970 --> 10:23.490
Absolutely not.

10:23.500 --> 10:24.650
Good.

10:30.700 --> 10:32.340
After you.

10:34.490 --> 10:36.270
I'll take the stairs.

10:47.130 --> 10:51.050
When first arrived on the scene, there was
just blood all over. It was disgusting.

10:51.090 --> 10:52.980
What was the source
of the blood, officer?

10:53.020 --> 10:58.180
A dead chicken, viciously pecked
to death by a killer cock— his.

10:58.810 --> 11:00.260
What happened next, officer?

11:00.300 --> 11:04.170
We ascertained tha the cockfighting
rooster belonged to the defendant.

11:04.210 --> 11:08.980
I placed him under arrest, advised him of
his rights in both english and spanish,

11:09.020 --> 11:14.366
rescued the surviving chicken from his
control and took the suspect into custody.

11:14.420 --> 11:18.880
Officer, you referred to the
demise of the losing chicken—

11:18.890 --> 11:21.330
I believe the word
you used was “vicious.”

11:21.370 --> 11:24.100
That's correct. Vicious–
blood everywhere.

11:24.140 --> 11:27.320
Would you consider it more or less
vicious than say scalding it with hot water

11:27.360 --> 11:29.500
so its feathers will fall out
and then slitting its throat?

11:29.540 --> 11:30.320
Objection.

11:30.330 --> 11:34.020
This won't be a referendum
on slaughterhouses, counsel.

11:34.790 --> 11:40.334
Officer, did you have an opportunity to
observe the demeanor of my client's rooster?

11:40.470 --> 11:41.480
Its demeanor?

11:41.490 --> 11:43.210
Yes. Did he seem happy?

11:43.220 --> 11:44.070
Counsel?

11:44.080 --> 11:45.040
I ask this, your honor,

11:45.080 --> 11:49.090
because many experts in animal
behavior have opined that cockfighting

11:49.130 --> 11:51.570
can actually be quite gratifying
to the feathered combatants—

11:51.610 --> 11:56.164
This witness is no expert in animal
behavior. She's a police officer.

11:56.470 --> 12:01.320
Officer, you testified that you rescued
my client's rooster from his control.

12:01.360 --> 12:02.840
Yes.

12:02.850 --> 12:04.020
What did you do with him?

12:04.060 --> 12:06.180
It was put to sleep.

12:06.520 --> 12:10.414
So when you say “rescued,” you
use the term rather loosely.

12:18.590 --> 12:20.760
One night, I was over at Jason's house.

12:20.800 --> 12:22.910
He's my boyfriend.

12:22.920 --> 12:26.050
Uh, his parents were away, and…

12:26.560 --> 12:28.820
things got out of control, I guess.

12:28.860 --> 12:30.540
You and Jason made love.

12:30.550 --> 12:31.830
Yes.

12:31.840 --> 12:33.680
How old are you, Abby?

12:33.690 --> 12:34.800
I'm 15.

12:34.810 --> 12:35.880
Outrageous!

12:35.890 --> 12:39.770
I think his honor means 15 is
a little young to be having sex.

12:39.810 --> 12:40.880
He's yet to have it.

12:40.920 --> 12:42.170
That's not true.

12:42.180 --> 12:43.750
Just continue.

12:45.660 --> 12:48.850
Things, uh, like I said, they—
they got out of control after that.

12:48.890 --> 12:51.490
And neither of you took precautions?

12:51.500 --> 12:54.260
No. We didn't have condoms and…

12:55.680 --> 12:57.440
it was really stupid.

12:57.450 --> 13:01.100
It turns out he was
H.I.V. positive. And…

13:01.830 --> 13:03.410
now I am.

13:03.420 --> 13:06.860
Did either of you ever think
about carrying a condom,

13:06.900 --> 13:09.070
just in case things ever…

13:09.080 --> 13:10.670
got out of control?

13:10.680 --> 13:13.160
No. We were taught abstinence.

13:13.170 --> 13:16.300
They basically drilled it into
us that condoms don't work.

13:16.340 --> 13:19.820
What did your school teach you
about other forms of birth control?

13:19.860 --> 13:22.880
We were taught
abstinence, pure and simple.

13:22.890 --> 13:24.100
No alternatives.

13:24.110 --> 13:28.720
Young lady, am I to understand that it's
the school's fault you have H.I.V.?

13:28.760 --> 13:31.200
It's partially mine, your honor.

13:31.210 --> 13:35.910
But when a school preaches to its
students that condoms are ineffective,

13:35.950 --> 13:39.820
you make it less likely that the
students will actually carry them.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.850
I don't think I'm out of line

13:41.860 --> 13:46.348
to suggest that the school should accept
a… a trickle of blame here.

13:51.050 --> 13:52.340
This isn't exactly on point,

13:52.380 --> 13:56.140
but there's evidence psychotherapy
for identity disorders can be harmful.

13:56.180 --> 13:59.640
Some “hidden identities,” as they're
called, have been brought out through hypnosis.

13:59.680 --> 14:02.190
These alter egos cause
injurious behavior.

14:02.230 --> 14:04.880
I've got a study that says
that four out of ten people

14:04.920 --> 14:08.490
who enter grief therapy after losing a
loved one are worse off after treatment.

14:08.530 --> 14:09.920
Four in ten?

14:09.930 --> 14:12.768
I think that might
occasion a duty to warn.

14:12.860 --> 14:15.104
What do we know about this doctor?

14:15.570 --> 14:17.200
Impeccable credentials.

14:17.210 --> 14:19.620
I suspect he'd like it to stay that way.

14:19.660 --> 14:23.400
My suggestion is we draft
a complaint, don't file it,

14:23.410 --> 14:26.370
set up a meeting with the doctor
and effect a quiet settlement.

14:26.410 --> 14:28.220
–Brilliant.
–Brilliant!

14:29.550 --> 14:31.950
I'm sorry. Sometimes I…

14:31.960 --> 14:33.900
I understand.

14:35.700 --> 14:38.350
I like practicing law with you, Katie.

14:38.360 --> 14:39.960
Thank you, Jerry.

14:39.970 --> 14:41.550
That's very sweet of you to say.

14:41.590 --> 14:43.680
You're a very sweet man.

14:46.820 --> 14:48.080
He was good— Sack?

14:48.090 --> 14:49.780
It doesn't matter.

14:49.790 --> 14:51.050
He can't win.

14:51.060 --> 14:52.990
His client broke the
law. The law is the law.

14:53.030 --> 14:54.750
The man's guilty.

14:56.810 --> 14:59.010
So, uh…

14:59.020 --> 15:01.230
how's working with Lorraine?

15:01.240 --> 15:03.600
Well, for the most part, I'm fine.

15:03.610 --> 15:06.900
I mean, she's just another
lawyer. She carries a briefcase,

15:06.940 --> 15:09.150
she has…

15:09.160 --> 15:10.800
a neck…

15:10.810 --> 15:13.060
long, tapered legs.

15:13.070 --> 15:14.940
Chiclets.

15:15.370 --> 15:16.360
I beg your pardon?

15:16.400 --> 15:18.150
An old trick my mother taught me.

15:18.190 --> 15:21.800
Chewing chiclets tempers sexual arousal.

15:21.810 --> 15:22.460
The gum?

15:22.470 --> 15:24.980
I chewed it all the way through law school.
It's the only thing that got me through.

15:25.020 --> 15:26.900
Don't be ridiculous.

15:26.910 --> 15:27.940
Okay. Well…

15:27.950 --> 15:29.930
Fine.

15:31.160 --> 15:32.150
I don't even need them.

15:32.190 --> 15:34.962
–She's just another lawyer.
–That's right.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.190
Chiclets.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.670
Chiclets.

15:48.640 --> 15:51.676
The more she gets to
you, the harder you chew.

16:06.860 --> 16:09.700
Look, I was dead set against the
abstinence program myself at first.

16:09.740 --> 16:12.990
As a high school principal for 20
years, I thought it was ludicrous.

16:13.030 --> 16:14.260
But you employed it.

16:14.300 --> 16:16.310
If we didn't, we'd lose federal funding.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.200
Without that, we can't teach anything.

16:18.240 --> 16:20.700
So this was all about the money?

16:20.710 --> 16:23.240
Not just. I looked at the numbers.

16:23.250 --> 16:27.370
Teen pregnancy rates have dropped since
the abstinence program has been in effect—

16:27.410 --> 16:29.680
in some states, almost by half.

16:29.690 --> 16:31.800
I had to pay attention to that.

16:32.130 --> 16:34.880
The studies I read attribute
the decline of teen pregnancies

16:34.920 --> 16:36.730
to the increased use of contraception.

16:36.770 --> 16:41.890
Yes, but I can't be sure that the abstinence
only program hasn't been effective as well.

16:41.930 --> 16:43.260
The numbers don't lie.

16:43.300 --> 16:44.440
Which numbers?

16:44.450 --> 16:46.640
Sexually transmitted disease
rates amongst teenagers

16:46.680 --> 16:49.730
who pledge abstinence are the same
as for the teenagers who don't.

16:49.770 --> 16:51.950
Because many don't live
up to the pledge.

16:51.990 --> 16:55.910
Statistics also show that abstinence
pledgers are less likely to see a doctor

16:55.950 --> 16:58.600
if they do get an S.T.D, less
likely to think they've got it.

16:58.640 --> 17:01.900
Turns out the pledgers are
more likely to spread S.T.Ds,

17:01.940 --> 17:05.300
which, funny thing, is exactly
what happened to my client here.

17:05.339 --> 17:09.380
Bottom line— teens that abstain
from sex don't get S.T.Ds

17:09.390 --> 17:10.660
Here's a bottom line—

17:10.700 --> 17:15.880
teens who aren't taught
sex education, including contraception,
are more likely to die.

17:15.920 --> 17:18.369
Hey, you don't like it, take
it up with your congressman.

17:18.410 --> 17:20.119
I'm just a high school principal.

17:20.160 --> 17:22.369
You're her principal, Mr Mckay.

17:22.380 --> 17:24.910
Abby didn't go to congress.
She went to school —yours—

17:24.950 --> 17:27.990
where she had an expectation
of being taught and cared for.

17:28.030 --> 17:33.904
Might you have at least warned her that her
welfare would come second to federal funding?

17:43.070 --> 17:45.000
Ms Rhodes, Dr Farrell, my
name's Katie Lloyd.

17:45.040 --> 17:48.320
This is my colleague Jerry
Espenson and our client Deena Rice.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.970
Thank you so much for agreeing
to meet at such short notice.

17:51.010 --> 17:52.620
Well, you made it sound rather urgent.

17:52.660 --> 17:57.900
Yes, well, Dr Farrell treated my
client's husband Matthew Rice
prior to his death by suicide.

17:57.940 --> 18:02.230
Without sounding obnoxiously
adversarial, we believe that Dr Farrell's
treatment of Mr Rice…

18:02.270 --> 18:04.750
may have played a role in that tragedy.

18:04.790 --> 18:05.890
What?

18:05.900 --> 18:08.720
We can't be sure, of course, without
exploring the nature of that treatment.

18:08.760 --> 18:12.170
And, well, given my client's
desire to avoid litigation,

18:12.210 --> 18:14.650
which perhaps might coincide
with Dr Farrell's wishes as well,

18:14.690 --> 18:18.650
we thought maybe we could work
this out quickly and quietly.

18:19.270 --> 18:22.530
Look, first of all, I don't
like the extortive overtones

18:22.570 --> 18:24.570
that occasioned this
meeting even to take place.

18:24.610 --> 18:26.890
Second, your inexperience aside,
Ms Lloyd,

18:26.930 --> 18:29.570
you should know better than to
threaten either me or my client.

18:29.610 --> 18:32.950
This doctor is one of the most respected
—if not the most respected—

18:32.990 --> 18:34.630
and admired member of his profession.

18:34.670 --> 18:36.070
Well, admittedly the doctor
may have done nothing wrong.

18:36.110 --> 18:38.130
But we can't know unless
we know what was done.

18:38.170 --> 18:41.000
So why don't you ask instead of
waving civil complaints in my face?

18:41.040 --> 18:43.290
Well, assuming he'd rightly
assert doctor-patient privilege

18:43.330 --> 18:45.990
,we have no means of discovery
without a proper lawsuit,

18:46.030 --> 18:48.390
which, once again, we felt both
parties would want to avoid.

18:48.430 --> 18:51.950
I can give you several studies which
show psychotherapy may be harmful,

18:51.990 --> 18:54.930
especially when it comes to grief
therapy for people losing loved ones.

18:54.970 --> 18:59.760
If you'd look at the data, you'll see talk
therapy can, in many cases, prolong suffering.

18:59.800 --> 19:02.020
I'm aware of those studies.
I happen to disagree with them.

19:02.060 --> 19:03.390
Which is certainly your right.

19:03.430 --> 19:05.970
But it would be the
patient's right to be warned.

19:06.010 --> 19:08.150
I believe you call it informed consent.

19:08.190 --> 19:13.470
Did you tell Mr Rice that psychotherapy
could be dangerous to his mental health?

19:14.030 --> 19:15.750
We're done. Bye-bye.

19:23.990 --> 19:25.070
They'll be back.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.870
They will? How can you tell?

19:26.910 --> 19:29.352
They don't want to risk a trial here.

19:30.850 --> 19:32.420
They'll be back.

19:36.220 --> 19:38.680
Your honor, Mr Obisbo
understands english,

19:38.720 --> 19:44.060
but since he can't speak it, I would like, with
the court's permission, to use an interpreter.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.710
I have brought one with me.

19:45.750 --> 19:47.000
Fine.

19:47.010 --> 19:48.600
Thank you.

19:48.610 --> 19:50.470
Sister?

19:57.850 --> 19:59.570
Buenos dias, hermana.

19:59.580 --> 20:04.926
Now, Miguel, would you first tell the jury
what interests you about cockfighting?

20:06.070 --> 20:08.248
it's part of our mexican culture.

20:08.250 --> 20:13.060
As little children, we're raised to
revere the noble cockfighting rooster.

20:13.100 --> 20:17.760
One of the reasons I came to America
—the greatest country in the world—

20:17.800 --> 20:19.840
was because of its tolerance,

20:19.850 --> 20:23.216
its willingness to embrace
cultures of other lands.

20:23.540 --> 20:25.190
God bless America.

20:25.200 --> 20:30.910
Okay, sir, but to many americans,
it seems cruel to treat chickens this way.

20:33.820 --> 20:35.870
The fighters love the competition.

20:35.910 --> 20:39.530
Mexicans, like Americans,
honor the warriors,

20:39.540 --> 20:42.048
like the troops fighting over in Iraq.

20:42.670 --> 20:44.280
God bless the troops.

20:44.290 --> 20:48.730
Okay, um, would you tell us
about your rooster in particular?

20:51.520 --> 20:53.310
His name was ronald.

20:53.710 --> 20:56.500
I named him after
Ronald Reagan, my hero.

20:56.870 --> 21:00.280
Ronald was like family.
And they killed him.

21:01.590 --> 21:04.164
The police gave him a lethal injection.

21:05.020 --> 21:06.760
They murdered Ronald Reagan.

21:06.800 --> 21:09.100
Ok, so you say he was
like family, and yet,

21:09.140 --> 21:11.710
you made him fight,
possibly to the death?

21:11.750 --> 21:13.268
No, no, no, no, no, no.

21:15.230 --> 21:16.360
No, no, no, no, no.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.990
I don't believe he would
ever have died fighting.

21:19.030 --> 21:21.270
He was a champion cock.

21:21.890 --> 21:24.464
It would bring me such joy to hold him,

21:24.920 --> 21:29.220
to hold that beautiful warrior
cock in my own two hands.

21:39.490 --> 21:41.140
God forgive me.

21:41.150 --> 21:43.900
The old interpreting nun
trick. He got it from me.

21:43.940 --> 21:46.830
Denny, $200,000 is a lot of money.

21:47.830 --> 21:48.770
Okay.

21:48.780 --> 21:50.060
Alan?

21:50.070 --> 21:53.436
I was wondering if we could
have a word in private.

21:55.070 --> 21:56.690
It's quite urgent.

21:56.700 --> 21:58.150
Oh, balls.

21:58.160 --> 22:00.400
Why does everybody want to
excuse me from the conversation?

22:00.440 --> 22:04.136
It's not like I'll remember it.
Mad cow for God's sakes.

22:12.590 --> 22:13.640
What's up?

22:13.650 --> 22:15.430
Well?

22:16.880 --> 22:21.370
I find Katie Lloyd to be…

22:22.100 --> 22:24.100
very, very sweet.

22:24.110 --> 22:26.250
That's great. So do I.

22:27.320 --> 22:31.090
Oh! You're sweet… on Katie.

22:31.100 --> 22:36.240
And… I'm not sure— well, I
think she might be sweet on me,

22:36.250 --> 22:41.160
but I just know if I try to say anything
romantically inclined, it won't come out right.

22:41.200 --> 22:43.220
I'll purr and…

22:43.230 --> 22:47.750
Well, uh, Jerry, office
romances are very complicated.

22:47.760 --> 22:49.980
I'd even say treacherous.

22:49.990 --> 22:51.330
That's a bit of a bubble buster.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.230
No, no. It's not that they can't work out

22:54.240 --> 22:57.450
or that they should
never be pursued but…

22:57.460 --> 23:00.690
Look, I find Lorraine to be…

23:02.560 --> 23:04.360
very sweet.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.060
But one needs to proceed with caution.

23:07.100 --> 23:08.980
Even when the heart knows?

23:08.990 --> 23:10.220
Especially then.

23:10.230 --> 23:13.490
The heart can be a real bastard.

23:14.380 --> 23:16.150
You don't think she
could be sweet on me.

23:16.190 --> 23:16.900
I didn't say that.

23:16.940 --> 23:18.940
Yes, you did. You're
saying,“be cautious, Jerry.

23:18.980 --> 23:20.340
She probably won't go for you.”

23:20.380 --> 23:21.520
–No, I did not.
–Did too!

23:21.560 --> 23:23.220
Did not!

23:30.600 --> 23:36.120
You sought out the worst possible
counsel on the topic of romance or love,

23:36.130 --> 23:39.360
which I don't understand
and have never understood.

23:39.400 --> 23:40.380
Why do you say that?

23:40.420 --> 23:43.670
Jerry, I just spent
six months with Gloria.

23:43.680 --> 23:46.160
On paper, I should be…

23:47.240 --> 23:51.200
somewhat broken up over the breakup.

23:51.570 --> 23:53.880
And I've barely given her
a thought the last week.

23:53.920 --> 23:57.210
I seem to be missing some kind of a…

23:58.450 --> 24:00.390
love gene.

24:02.400 --> 24:07.284
Look, if it feels right with Katie, perhaps
you should trust that feeling.

24:07.690 --> 24:09.440
But just proceed with
caution because—

24:09.480 --> 24:11.290
The heart can be a bastard.

24:14.170 --> 24:16.740
It's not just that it's against the law.

24:16.780 --> 24:19.780
It's indecent, barbaric…

24:19.790 --> 24:21.380
inhumane.

24:21.390 --> 24:23.780
Two chickens
—roosters, I should say—

24:23.820 --> 24:26.670
are thrown in a pit
and forced to do battle

24:26.680 --> 24:29.920
until one loses consciousness
due to blood loss,

24:29.930 --> 24:33.280
at which point the
other pecks its head off.

24:33.290 --> 24:34.360
It's sick.

24:34.370 --> 24:35.830
And this man openly,

24:35.840 --> 24:40.070
notoriously broke the
law to commit a sick,

24:40.080 --> 24:43.950
sick crime, one he admits committing.

24:44.490 --> 24:49.890
Just having a nun translate for you
doesn't put you on the side of the angels.

24:56.630 --> 24:58.270
Denny, when the district attorney speaks,

24:58.310 --> 25:01.544
it's not appropriate for
you to nod in agreement.

25:07.170 --> 25:09.870
Do you realize chickens
are smarter than dogs?

25:09.910 --> 25:12.940
Much, much smarter than horses.

25:12.950 --> 25:14.960
And we call them fowl.

25:15.740 --> 25:21.830
How sad that the chicken by far is
the most abused animal on the planet…

25:22.210 --> 25:24.750
raised in crates less
than a square foot,

25:24.790 --> 25:28.430
the ends of their beaks
snapped off after hatching,

25:28.440 --> 25:34.460
pumped up with antibiotics to keep them alive
in conditions that would otherwise kill them,

25:34.470 --> 25:38.500
genetically altered so that
they grow twice as fast,

25:38.510 --> 25:42.470
sent off to the slaughterhouse
after only six weeks of living,

25:42.510 --> 25:48.210
typically in open crates where millions of
them either freeze to death or get baked alive.

25:48.250 --> 25:52.750
The ones who do arrive undead
are scalded to de-feather them.

25:52.760 --> 25:57.290
Then they're hung upside down
and electrocuted just enough

25:57.300 --> 26:00.870
so they don't flap around while
getting their throats slit.

26:00.910 --> 26:04.180
It's not good to be a chicken.

26:05.080 --> 26:08.110
Now the cockfighters—

26:08.120 --> 26:10.350
they get real food.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.990
They get real room to move.

26:13.000 --> 26:17.090
They're often loved as pets.

26:17.100 --> 26:21.450
They get at least two good years

26:21.460 --> 26:24.530
before they're even asked to do combat.

26:24.830 --> 26:27.790
And if he's a really good fighter,

26:27.800 --> 26:30.450
he gets to retire to stud service,

26:30.460 --> 26:34.500
where he could live the life
of— well, of Denny Crane.

26:35.180 --> 26:38.320
The simple truth is that
if a chicken in this country

26:38.360 --> 26:42.710
hopes to be afforded
a modicum of dignity,

26:42.720 --> 26:44.680
he has to fight.

26:45.620 --> 26:48.890
Studies show they
might actually enjoy it.

26:48.900 --> 26:54.690
Now I suppose you could find my
client guilty because technically,

26:54.700 --> 27:00.160
he broke a law… which
screams out with hypocrisy.

27:00.170 --> 27:03.660
Or you could say,“wait a second.

27:04.050 --> 27:08.640
Miguel Obisbo offers
chickens a better life.”

27:09.380 --> 27:10.820
Miguel Obisbo…

27:10.830 --> 27:15.830
now trusts you to be humane,

27:15.840 --> 27:18.090
not just for his sake…

27:20.510 --> 27:22.490
but for the chickens.

27:44.220 --> 27:45.460
$125,000.

27:45.470 --> 27:46.300
Nonstarter.

27:46.310 --> 27:49.970
My client did absolutely nothing wrong.
There is no evidence of malpractice—

27:50.010 --> 27:52.900
Discussion of evidence is premature
since we haven't begun discovery.

27:52.940 --> 27:56.650
But what we do know is Mr Rice's
mental well-being deteriorated

27:56.690 --> 27:58.660
while under the continued
care of Dr Farrell.

27:58.700 --> 28:03.230
And during that time, he was never once warned
that psychotherapy had a 40% failure rate,

28:03.270 --> 28:05.200
and in fact could worsen symptoms.

28:05.240 --> 28:06.790
40%.

28:06.800 --> 28:10.970
If any drug had that failure rate, it
would be yanked off the market in days.

28:11.010 --> 28:13.940
Your client should be happy to settle for
any amount as long as it's confidential

28:13.980 --> 28:17.120
and within the policy limits, his
limit being $1 million.

28:17.160 --> 28:18.330
We're not giving you $1 million.

28:18.370 --> 28:19.800
A man died here!

28:19.810 --> 28:23.410
Treatment, failure to warn, dead—
that's a plaintiff trifecta.

28:23.450 --> 28:26.040
40% failure rate in psychotherapy.

28:26.050 --> 28:28.558
None of us wants to see that headline.

28:28.680 --> 28:31.110
Actually, I can live with it.

28:32.890 --> 28:35.650
Matthew Rice perhaps could've.

28:37.410 --> 28:40.260
$375,000. That's as
high as I'm authorized.

28:40.270 --> 28:42.420
I need to speak to somebody
with more authority then.

28:42.460 --> 28:44.160
Then why don't you give me
your number?

28:44.200 --> 28:46.370
$650,000.

28:46.380 --> 28:48.280
$550,000.

28:48.290 --> 28:49.820
Nothing structured, all up front?

28:49.860 --> 28:51.070
Sealed, no admission.

28:51.110 --> 28:52.570
I'll recommend it.

28:58.790 --> 29:02.600
–We just nicked $550,000 off them.
–We did.

29:02.610 --> 29:04.370
Jerry, that was fantastic. Brilliant.

29:04.410 --> 29:05.940
Brilliant! Well?

29:05.950 --> 29:09.778
You're the dog's bollocks, that's
what you are. Fantastic.

29:12.320 --> 29:16.570
Your honor, I think we all agree that
15 is too young to be having sex.

29:16.610 --> 29:19.190
Is there anyone here who
takes issue with that?

29:19.230 --> 29:23.980
Sometimes when the right
answer is “no,” you say “no.”

29:24.310 --> 29:28.732
You don't start tinkering with
morality to coincide with logistics.

29:28.740 --> 29:30.410
Kids need to hear “no.”

29:30.420 --> 29:33.600
Not “here's how, just
in case,” but “no.”

29:33.610 --> 29:35.640
Abstinence was the right answer here.

29:35.680 --> 29:39.550
If she hadn't had sex, she
wouldn't be H.I.V positive.

29:40.000 --> 29:45.180
And even if you are so
determined to opt for pragmatism,

29:45.190 --> 29:47.390
abstinence is still the right answer.

29:47.430 --> 29:49.940
Since the implementation of this policy,

29:49.980 --> 29:53.130
the teen pregnancy
rate has gone down 30%.

29:53.140 --> 29:55.730
More and more kids are
choosing not to have sex.

29:55.770 --> 29:59.450
And that's good, whether they
get sick or pregnant or not.

29:59.490 --> 30:04.410
And if parents disagree, by the
way, they can choose to teach their kids

30:04.420 --> 30:07.790
about condoms and birth
control pills and diaphragms.

30:07.830 --> 30:11.000
But once the school
starts doing so, come on.

30:11.010 --> 30:15.530
You're implicitly telling the kids it's
expected of them to be sexually active.

30:15.570 --> 30:19.330
And many start doing so because
they feel all their friends are.

30:19.370 --> 30:21.770
Sure, we can pass out condoms.

30:21.780 --> 30:25.370
But it is simply more
responsible, more moral and yes,

30:25.380 --> 30:28.480
more safe to practice abstinence.

30:28.490 --> 30:30.998
That's what we should be telling them.

30:31.510 --> 30:33.570
And this school is.

30:34.720 --> 30:37.170
This case isn't about teenage pregnancy.

30:37.210 --> 30:39.850
She didn't get pregnant.
She got H.I.V.

30:39.860 --> 30:44.060
I can see why you'd want to make
it about teenage pregnancy since…

30:44.100 --> 30:46.060
well, actually, I can't.

30:46.070 --> 30:50.750
The United States has the worst teen
pregnancy rate of any industrialized nation.

30:50.790 --> 30:54.040
And contrary to what Mr Jovanka
would like us to believe,

30:54.080 --> 30:59.110
there is no evidence whatsoever
that suggests using condoms

30:59.120 --> 31:04.170
or teaching students about condoms
makes them any more inclined to have sex.

31:04.180 --> 31:05.310
None.

31:05.320 --> 31:08.520
They're already inclined to have sex
and have been since early puberty.

31:08.560 --> 31:10.220
They're simply going
to do it. We all do it.

31:10.260 --> 31:12.780
Birds do it. Bees do
it. Educated fleas do it.

31:12.820 --> 31:14.800
One day, your honor, even you—

31:16.000 --> 31:21.880
Yes, the fact is this case has nothing to do
with the efficacy of abstinence-only programs.

31:21.920 --> 31:25.980
This case is about religion, politics
and federal funding.

31:25.990 --> 31:30.210
Our present administration, in blind
service to the religious right,

31:30.250 --> 31:33.670
has transcended the
separation of church and stat

31:33.680 --> 31:38.720
and consistently implemented a faith-
based political and moral mandate.

31:38.730 --> 31:42.950
And now that same policy has been
passed on to our educational system.

31:42.990 --> 31:47.090
If schools teach abstinence
only, they get federal funding.

31:47.100 --> 31:50.320
If they teach any other type
of sex education, they don't.

31:50.360 --> 31:51.510
And as a result,

31:51.520 --> 31:56.170
the students in these abstinence only
programs aren't being taught the truth

31:56.210 --> 31:59.950
about that magnificent
technological marvel: the condom.

31:59.960 --> 32:03.062
That's not a dirty
word, your honor; “condoms.”

32:03.260 --> 32:07.960
They first came on the scene
some 3,000 years ago in Egypt.

32:07.970 --> 32:12.030
For centuries they went
merrily along in modified forms,

32:12.040 --> 32:16.760
warding off syphilis, gonorrhea,
preventing unplanned pregnancies,

32:16.770 --> 32:19.370
until science and medicine
eventually caught up

32:19.410 --> 32:22.900
and the pill became a much more
effective, less intrusive contraceptive.

32:22.940 --> 32:27.870
Penicillin and other antibiotics were
miracle cures for gonorrhea and syphilis.

32:27.910 --> 32:31.270
The poor, humble condom languished.

32:32.270 --> 32:35.430
And then came AIDS… this…

32:36.860 --> 32:41.350
terrifying new disease
that panicked the world.

32:41.940 --> 32:45.550
For many years, it has been
fatal, gruesomely so in every case.

32:45.590 --> 32:48.190
There was no vaccine, no
cure, no treatment.

32:48.230 --> 32:50.260
But there were condoms,
and they worked.

32:50.300 --> 32:56.070
They were safe, time tested, easy to
use, and they protected both partners.

32:56.570 --> 33:02.790
The condom is arguably the single most
important invention of the past 2,000 years.

33:02.800 --> 33:07.960
In fact, it has been said without exaggeration
that the health of the world depends on them.

33:08.000 --> 33:13.460
Now one would think that the obvious
choice would be for schools to tell
their students as much.

33:13.500 --> 33:18.730
But Abby's school —indeed, all schools that
teach abstinence only— have chosen to lie.

33:18.770 --> 33:22.180
They teach that condoms are ineffective
at preventing pregnancies, which is a lie.

33:22.220 --> 33:25.440
They teach that condoms are ineffective
at preventing diseases, which is a lie.

33:25.480 --> 33:29.910
Some of the literature actually compares
using a condom to playing russian roulette,

33:29.950 --> 33:33.860
which is a frightening,
despicable, unforgivable lie.

33:50.160 --> 33:52.620
Abby holt has H.I.V…

33:52.630 --> 33:55.590
which in all likelihood
will develop into AIDS.

33:55.630 --> 33:59.260
We've sort of forgotten about
AIDS in this country.

34:00.230 --> 34:02.980
Treatments have improved dramatically.

34:02.990 --> 34:06.780
Drugs are keeping people alive for
many years after they become infected.

34:06.820 --> 34:12.290
But the grim butcher's bill for this
pandemic still keeps growing and growing.

34:12.300 --> 34:16.429
65 million people worldwide
have become infected.

34:16.440 --> 34:19.840
One time unprotected sex can kill you.

34:20.210 --> 34:22.370
A condom can save you.

34:22.380 --> 34:28.040
It is inconceivable that
every child in the world

34:28.050 --> 34:29.429
isn't taught that.

34:29.440 --> 34:32.050
We should be in criminal
court this very moment,

34:32.090 --> 34:36.908
trying this obscenely duplicitous
school for conspiracy to commit murder.

34:48.969 --> 34:51.100
But frankly, I have no…

34:52.330 --> 34:54.570
stomach for that.

34:55.690 --> 35:00.790
I think of the horror that has been
inflicted on this 15–year-old girl,

35:00.800 --> 35:05.510
and I'm just so profoundly sad.

35:06.930 --> 35:09.300
I can point out the evils
of this corrupt system.

35:09.340 --> 35:14.720
I can tell you how effective condoms are, the
lives they save on and on and on and on and

35:14.760 --> 35:18.800
but words seem to be these hollow,

35:18.810 --> 35:21.350
useless things rattling
around in this courtroom.

35:21.390 --> 35:26.250
Because ultimately the lies
this school told Abby Holt may…

35:26.720 --> 35:28.490
will probably kill her.

35:29.740 --> 35:32.180
They have certainly
altered her life forever.

35:32.220 --> 35:35.380
And in the face of
that, all I can think of is…

35:36.600 --> 35:38.430
why?

35:50.930 --> 35:53.210
I give long closings.

36:04.470 --> 36:06.516
Will the defendant please rise?

36:08.590 --> 36:09.790
I'm a little nervous. You?

36:09.830 --> 36:11.520
The suspense is killing me.

36:11.560 --> 36:15.160
Tell you what, I'll give you some insurance.
$100,000— cut your loss in half.

36:15.200 --> 36:16.880
The man is
guilty, black–and–white.

36:16.920 --> 36:19.160
Has the jury reached
a unanimous verdict?

36:19.200 --> 36:20.460
We have, your honor.

36:20.500 --> 36:21.870
How say you?

36:21.880 --> 36:25.010
In the matter of the
Commonwealth vs Miguel Obisbo,

36:25.050 --> 36:28.020
we the jury find the
defendant Miguel Obisbo…

36:29.070 --> 36:30.080
not guilty.

36:30.090 --> 36:31.600
What?

36:31.610 --> 36:32.940
We appeal, your honor.

36:32.980 --> 36:35.930
Mr Crane, you can't appeal an acquittal.

36:35.940 --> 36:40.110
And it would be especially
unusual for the defense to try.

36:40.120 --> 36:42.790
We're adjourned. The
defendant is free to go.

36:42.830 --> 36:43.840
Gracias, señor Sack.

36:43.880 --> 36:45.690
Hey, hey, hey!

36:47.040 --> 36:49.260
Yes, I'm sure you're telling
me that you're very happy.

36:49.300 --> 36:50.820
I'm— I'm happy, too.

36:51.420 --> 36:55.270
You're welcome, Miguel.
Tell the family hi for me. Bye–bye.

36:55.310 --> 36:58.940
Hey, don't you want to hug
Miguel? He seems very happy.

36:59.440 --> 37:00.870
Oh, Mr Crane?

37:10.080 --> 37:11.760
Oh, my. What do we have here?

37:11.800 --> 37:14.230
I brought you some flowers
to celebrate our good result.

37:14.270 --> 37:16.310
Jerry, you positively…

37:16.320 --> 37:19.250
I should be bringing you flowers
after your brilliant negotiation.

37:19.290 --> 37:21.204
You accomplished that result.

37:23.300 --> 37:27.326
I thought maybe we could celebrate
by getting dinner tonight?

37:27.460 --> 37:29.400
That's a fab idea.
I'd love that. Brilliant.

37:29.440 --> 37:30.680
Brilliant!

37:31.160 --> 37:33.050
–8:00?
–8:00 it is.

37:41.120 --> 37:42.490
Jerry?

37:43.310 --> 37:47.204
It would be as colleagues
celebrating a litigation victory?

37:47.400 --> 37:50.670
I only ask… I wouldn't want
it to be construed as a date.

37:50.710 --> 37:53.090
Not that I think that was your
intent, but just to be clear.

37:53.130 --> 37:55.990
No, no. I only meant as colleagues.

37:56.250 --> 38:00.100
Not that you wouldn't be an absolutely
delightful man to date. Any woman
should be so lucky.

38:00.140 --> 38:02.500
But since I work with you,
for me it's…

38:02.540 --> 38:05.390
No. I-I only meant as colleagues.

38:07.040 --> 38:08.090
8:00 then?

38:08.100 --> 38:09.710
8:00.

38:19.010 --> 38:20.660
First…

38:20.670 --> 38:25.390
let me say I find this
national obsession with sex…

38:25.740 --> 38:27.190
to be disgusting.

38:27.200 --> 38:32.150
Young girls walking around in t-shirts with
vulgar verbs written across their chests

38:32.190 --> 38:34.310
and on their buttocks,

38:34.320 --> 38:39.580
television news, movies–‐
it's all sex, sex, sex, sex, sex!

38:39.590 --> 38:41.950
–Outrageous.
–Outrageous.

38:41.960 --> 38:46.850
And while I admire the school's motives
in trying to stress abstinence—

38:46.860 --> 38:51.700
and they should— the evidence suggests
that they are no less likely to fornicate

38:51.740 --> 38:55.620
and even more likely not
to use condoms when they do.

38:55.630 --> 39:00.150
The statistics on AIDS are horrifying,
65 million and counting.

39:00.630 --> 39:04.820
A condom may just be the greatest health
advice we could possibly give our children,

39:04.860 --> 39:07.660
more important even than seat belts.

39:08.070 --> 39:11.750
In this sad, sad day

39:11.760 --> 39:15.490
when sex seems to be everywhere,

39:15.500 --> 39:20.520
how can we fail to give
them proper sex education?

39:20.850 --> 39:25.610
I order the school district to
scrap its abstinence-only program,

39:25.620 --> 39:29.470
to start teaching sex education,

39:29.480 --> 39:35.050
and I order them to pay
the petitioners $750,000

39:35.060 --> 39:37.420
in compensatory damages.

39:37.780 --> 39:39.370
Adjourned.

39:39.990 --> 39:42.610
Oh, my gosh. I never even
asked for money, did I?

39:42.650 --> 39:44.320
No, you did not.
Congratulations, Abby.

39:44.360 --> 39:46.330
Oh, thank you. Thank you
for all of your work.

39:46.370 --> 39:47.700
Oh, and—
and thank you.

39:47.740 --> 39:50.460
Thank you. You're terrific.

39:50.470 --> 39:51.200
Thank you.

39:51.210 --> 39:53.400
I must say, as satisfying
as the ruling was,

39:53.440 --> 39:56.940
it was equally gratifying to know you
and I can work together without incident.

39:56.980 --> 39:58.510
Yes, very gratifying.

39:58.520 --> 39:59.970
The truth is…

39:59.980 --> 40:01.690
I felt perfectly comfortable.

40:01.730 --> 40:04.050
We just needed to get
it out of our system.

40:04.090 --> 40:05.160
And now it's out.

40:05.200 --> 40:06.280
Completely.

40:06.290 --> 40:08.040
Congratulations, Alan.

40:08.050 --> 40:09.740
You, too, Lorraine.

40:21.640 --> 40:23.610
Maybe it's the elevator.

40:24.780 --> 40:27.948
I had a thing about
desktops when I was younger…

40:28.990 --> 40:31.100
and the backseat of cars…

40:31.110 --> 40:32.650
and farms.

40:32.660 --> 40:34.160
Is there something wrong
with me, Denny?

40:34.200 --> 40:36.420
I don't even really think of Gloria.

40:36.460 --> 40:38.690
Well, why should you? She's a
cold–hearted bitch— Gloria.

40:38.730 --> 40:40.450
She'd have been awful for you.

40:40.490 --> 40:42.070
Well, why didn't you ever tell me that?

40:42.110 --> 40:44.270
Well, you had to see it for
yourself, and I knew you would.

40:44.310 --> 40:47.280
Besides, you'd have dismissed
anything I had to say,

40:47.320 --> 40:50.340
thinking that I was trying to split
you up so I could sleep with her.

40:50.380 --> 40:51.960
Can I now, by the way?

40:54.220 --> 40:56.770
Lorraine could be right for you.

40:57.490 --> 40:59.420
I don't know.

40:59.430 --> 41:02.940
It's just her smell and her… arms…

41:02.950 --> 41:05.610
and her… legs.

41:05.620 --> 41:07.060
Yes or no on Gloria? Can I?

41:07.100 --> 41:08.890
You just said she was
a cold-hearted bitch.

41:08.930 --> 41:11.010
Yeah. I like that. Can I?

41:12.320 --> 41:15.320
You know what? You're both consenting
adults. It's none of my business.

41:15.360 --> 41:17.406
Well, that's a mature response.

41:18.780 --> 41:20.050
–Denny—
–No!

41:20.060 --> 41:23.650
Forget Shirley. She's grandmothered in.

41:26.730 --> 41:28.260
<i>♫ I've just found joy ♫</i>

41:28.300 --> 41:30.170
Oh, Alan…

41:30.180 --> 41:32.400
aren't women just the best?

41:32.410 --> 41:33.960
Indeed.

41:33.970 --> 41:35.820
I love 'em all.

41:35.830 --> 41:37.180
They all love me.

41:38.950 --> 41:40.590
it's good to be Denny Crane.

41:40.630 --> 41:42.870
Not bad to be you right now.

41:43.640 --> 41:45.530
It has its moments.

41:46.930 --> 41:48.940
Lorraine.

41:48.950 --> 41:50.900
Lemon lorraine pie.
