WEBVTT

00:01.686 --> 00:05.315
<i>Dear Thomas, please watch after my
child until I can come back for her.</i>

00:06.924 --> 00:10.416
Two low-ranking Vietnamese army
officers were picked up at the airport.

00:10.494 --> 00:12.587
But I suspect the woman
they're after is... Michelle.

00:12.663 --> 00:15.894
It's been six years. What
do you think she looks like?

00:16.200 --> 00:18.964
<i>Well, you can certainly see
her mother's Oriental heritage.</i>

00:19.036 --> 00:21.231
Does she look like anybody else?

00:21.739 --> 00:24.071
<i>As long as she's with you,
you're writing her death sentence.</i>

02:29.617 --> 02:32.711
And you will be at the
center of the grandstand

02:32.787 --> 02:35.187
right next to me.

02:35.256 --> 02:37.781
<i>That is a great honor,
General Minh.</i>

02:37.858 --> 02:40.725
But there are many others
more deserving than I.

02:40.795 --> 02:42.854
<i>Besides, I have
pressing family...</i>

02:42.930 --> 02:44.989
<i>General Hue, your wife.</i>

02:45.566 --> 02:47.090
<i>Well, I do hope
that I'm interrupting</i>

02:47.168 --> 02:49.693
something terribly
tedious and boring.

02:50.104 --> 02:51.833
<i>Not at all, darling.</i>

02:51.906 --> 02:56.570
General was just going over the final
preparations for the people's celebration.

02:58.112 --> 03:01.104
<i>Well, forgive me for
barging in on you like this,</i>

03:01.182 --> 03:03.980
but I was hoping that we
could get an early start.

03:04.085 --> 03:06.781
<i>With all the traffic coming
into the city, of course.</i>

03:06.854 --> 03:11.917
I'm afraid something
has come up unexpectedly.

03:11.993 --> 03:15.895
But Nguyen... I'm going to
have to join you a little later.

03:15.963 --> 03:18.158
<i>Well, then I'll wait
and I'll go when you go.</i>

03:18.232 --> 03:22.100
<i>Please, do as I say, Michelle.</i>

03:23.804 --> 03:28.173
<i>As a gift to Mother, I've
written a poem for her birthday.</i>

03:28.242 --> 03:32.872
In case I'm detained a
little longer than I think.

03:32.947 --> 03:36.348
Luang has agreed to take
you to the train depot.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.749
I will bring the car
when I come.

03:45.459 --> 03:47.450
I will be waiting for you.

03:56.537 --> 04:00.769
<i>Too bad you will miss
the celebration, Madam Hue.</i>

04:05.579 --> 04:08.139
It is an occasion
I do not wish to celebrate.

04:25.166 --> 04:28.863
<i>Saigon, April 30th, 1975.</i>

04:28.936 --> 04:33.805
<i>No matter how hard I tried, I could never
put that day completely out of my mind.</i>

04:33.874 --> 04:36.866
<i>A chaotic ending
to a chaotic time.</i>

04:41.148 --> 04:44.811
<i>A war that kept changing,
even in retrospect.</i>

04:44.885 --> 04:47.183
<i>And every time I thought
I'd put it behind me,</i>

04:47.254 --> 04:49.848
<i>it crept up and tapped me on the shoulder.</i>

04:49.924 --> 04:52.119
<i>Magnum, what is
the meaning of this?</i>

04:52.860 --> 04:54.953
Don't you ever knock?

04:55.863 --> 04:58.195
The Anglo-Hawaiian Society
of Living Masterpieces

04:58.265 --> 04:59.562
is arriving in less than two hours.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.158
You don't just come creeping
up on somebody like that.

05:02.236 --> 05:04.932
Creeping? I've been searching
for you for 45 minutes!

05:05.005 --> 05:06.870
<i>Well, I've been busy.
I see.</i>

05:06.941 --> 05:09.432
Too busy to properly attend to
commitments you've made to other people?

05:09.510 --> 05:11.478
I'll pick up the costumes.
I've still got another...

05:11.545 --> 05:14.844
<i>Forty-five minutes, which is precisely
how long I've been looking for you!</i>

05:14.915 --> 05:16.212
<i>Well, you see.
You could've gone</i>

05:16.283 --> 05:19.184
and saved yourself
all this aggravation.

05:19.653 --> 05:23.248
Indeed. But then who would have
been here to sign for the telegram?

05:23.757 --> 05:25.554
What telegram?

05:27.228 --> 05:28.456
I got a telegram?

05:28.529 --> 05:29.723
Don't give it another thought.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.560
I'll file it with the rest of your junk mail.

05:31.632 --> 05:32.929
<i>No, no, Higgins, wait.</i>

05:33.000 --> 05:35.366
You can look it over when
you're not quite so busy.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.768
<i>All right, all right, all right!</i>

05:38.939 --> 05:41.430
The costumes for the telegram.

05:44.278 --> 05:48.044
You didn't have to resort to such
tactics. I had every intention of...

05:48.115 --> 05:50.913
<i>The road to Hades was paved
with good intentions, Magnum.</i>

05:50.985 --> 05:55.251
<i>If you would discharge your duties
promptly, and with some degree of...</i>

06:06.634 --> 06:08.295
Magnum?

06:19.947 --> 06:22.381
What in bloody blue blazes?

06:23.551 --> 06:25.416
<i>The telegram said only to come,</i>

06:25.486 --> 06:28.114
<i>and once again,
I knew I had no choice.</i>

06:31.058 --> 06:33.652
<i>With this ring, I thee wed.</i>

06:37.831 --> 06:41.665
I pronounce you man and wife.

06:43.571 --> 06:46.540
<i>I love you more than anything in this world.</i>

06:49.109 --> 06:50.337
Thomas.

08:40.587 --> 08:41.576
Michelle?

08:56.737 --> 08:59.968
<i>Thomas, I'm Sister Mary Rose.</i>

09:00.174 --> 09:01.766
I was supposed to meet...

09:01.842 --> 09:04.709
I know. She's waiting for you.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.772
Come with me.

09:18.158 --> 09:19.682
It's all right.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.059
Come with me.

09:27.201 --> 09:28.395
Here we are.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.998
Her name is Lily Catherine.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.870
Her mother asked me
to give you this letter.

09:44.518 --> 09:48.079
<i>Dear Thomas, forgive me, but I
didn't know where else to turn.</i>

09:48.155 --> 09:51.056
<i>This is my daughter,
Lily Catherine.</i>

09:57.698 --> 10:01.259
<i>I can't answer all the
questions I know you must have.</i>

10:01.335 --> 10:03.963
<i>I can only tell you that my
husband is in grave danger,</i>

10:04.037 --> 10:05.664
<i>and I must return to him.</i>

10:05.739 --> 10:08.970
<i>Please watch after my child
until I can come back for her.</i>

10:09.042 --> 10:12.273
<i>I know no harm can come to her
as long as she is with you.</i>

10:14.515 --> 10:16.107
<i>Aloha, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

10:16.183 --> 10:19.516
<i>For those destined to
downtown Honolulu and Waikiki,</i>

10:19.586 --> 10:22.453
<i>the Wiki Wiki bus
will depart in 10 minutes.</i>

10:24.858 --> 10:26.587
Madam Hue.

10:51.418 --> 10:54.717
Police! Don't move!
Don't move.

10:56.557 --> 10:58.650
Drive. Drive!

11:08.274 --> 11:10.742
<i>Botticelli's Primavera.</i>

11:16.208 --> 11:17.732
<i>Primavera.</i>

11:29.888 --> 11:32.948
<i>Very nice. Hold it, hold it.
Don't even breathe.</i>

11:33.726 --> 11:37.218
<i>Jonathan, I must speak to you
about the Mona Lisa.</i>

11:37.296 --> 11:39.560
<i>At the break, Agatha.</i>

11:39.631 --> 11:42.532
Not an eye should blink
till I give the command.

11:47.539 --> 11:49.131
Magnum.

11:50.009 --> 11:51.306
Jonathan?

11:57.983 --> 12:00.679
You'll like it here.
You can go swimming and...

12:04.356 --> 12:05.823
Magnum?

12:06.358 --> 12:08.553
Wait right here.

12:14.299 --> 12:15.527
What took you so long?

12:15.601 --> 12:18.331
We've rehearsed three masterpieces
already without benefit of costume.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.235
Where are they?
The costumes?

12:22.608 --> 12:24.075
You don't have them.

12:24.143 --> 12:25.132
We...

12:25.277 --> 12:27.006
I ran into a little trouble.

12:27.079 --> 12:28.842
I demand that you step
out of my way immediately.

12:28.914 --> 12:30.506
I have a right to see
what pressing problem

12:30.582 --> 12:33.676
<i>could possibly have taken precedence
over La nuit des mille oeuvres.</i>

12:40.092 --> 12:41.787
<i>This is Lily, Higgins.</i>

12:42.061 --> 12:44.529
She's going to be staying
with us for a while.

12:51.170 --> 12:52.159
No.

12:53.939 --> 12:55.600
What is the meaning of this?

12:55.674 --> 12:56.868
What is she saying?

12:56.942 --> 12:58.409
You don't understand French?

12:58.477 --> 13:00.945
<i>Well, no, not all of it. I tried
to speak to her in Vietnamese,</i>

13:01.013 --> 13:03.481
but I guess mine's
getting a little rusty.

13:09.054 --> 13:11.249
What is she saying?

13:11.490 --> 13:14.516
<i>She says her father is a very
brave man, according to her mother</i>

13:14.593 --> 13:17.653
who can't be very smart if she's
entrusted the care of her child to you.

13:17.729 --> 13:20.163
<i>Careful, Higgins.
She may understand English.</i>

13:20.232 --> 13:22.427
Which is more than we can say for you.

13:28.140 --> 13:31.132
<i>Magnum? I promised her
something to eat, Higgins.</i>

13:31.210 --> 13:32.802
I'll get on the costumes
right after that.

13:32.878 --> 13:35.711
I'm sure I can find somebody
to open up the store.

13:38.517 --> 13:41.247
Do you like hot dogs?

13:44.623 --> 13:47.091
Ow! Oh. Here.

13:53.632 --> 13:56.658
<i>Darling,
I need you to sit there.</i>

13:56.735 --> 13:57.895
<i>You know, you're going to like these.</i>

13:57.970 --> 14:00.598
My Uncle Lyle taught me
how to make them.

14:01.507 --> 14:05.375
<i>No, Lily, darling, I need you to sit here.</i>

14:05.811 --> 14:06.800
There you go.

14:10.616 --> 14:11.605
Okay.

14:17.422 --> 14:18.411
There.

14:18.857 --> 14:19.846
Uh...

14:20.859 --> 14:22.986
Wash your hands. Yeah.

14:26.665 --> 14:28.360
Here we go.

14:29.434 --> 14:31.834
Okay. That's one.

14:32.838 --> 14:33.827
All dry.

14:34.540 --> 14:35.973
Thank you.

14:41.180 --> 14:42.169
Okay.

14:44.016 --> 14:45.005
There.

14:51.023 --> 14:55.960
Why don't you watch the game? I'll
turn the volume up. While I make lunch.

14:56.028 --> 14:58.462
<i>And the runner
takes his lead from third.</i>

14:58.530 --> 15:01.021
<i>Well, here's the
three-two pitch.</i>

15:02.467 --> 15:03.866
<i>The curveball is hit.</i>

15:03.936 --> 15:05.335
Detroit Tiger?

15:05.404 --> 15:07.599
<i>No, honey, that's the Dodgers.</i>

15:07.673 --> 15:08.697
<i>And here comes Jefferson.</i>

15:08.774 --> 15:09.866
Detroit Tiger?

15:09.942 --> 15:13.378
<i>He's out! What a play by
the Cardinal left-fielder</i>

15:13.445 --> 15:16.073
<i>as he guns down the
Dodgers' bid to tie the game.</i>

15:16.148 --> 15:20.312
<i>And the score at the end of three
remains St. Louis, 3, Dodgers, 2.</i>

15:21.253 --> 15:23.881
She told you
about the Detroit Tigers.

15:26.225 --> 15:27.214
How...

15:31.697 --> 15:33.358
Five years old.

15:42.374 --> 15:44.103
<i>It's like this. Now, watch.</i>

15:44.876 --> 15:47.640
Mmm! Mmm!

15:49.581 --> 15:53.381
<i>Okay, your turn. Come on.
Oh, come on. Just one bite.</i>

15:56.922 --> 15:58.583
<i>Maman!</i>

16:02.394 --> 16:05.830
<i>To find out just how these two
men were able to smuggle weapons</i>

16:05.897 --> 16:08.832
<i>aboard their Pan Pacific
flight into Honolulu.</i>

16:08.900 --> 16:13.269
<i>And anyone with information leading to
the identity or whereabouts of this woman</i>

16:13.338 --> 16:16.307
<i>should contact the
Honolulu Police Department.</i>

16:16.375 --> 16:17.808
<i>We will now return to the game</i>

16:17.876 --> 16:20.936
<i>between the Los Angeles Dodgers
and the St. Louis Cardinals.</i>

16:32.758 --> 16:36.285
<i>Jonathan, there's been some
talk that you've decided</i>

16:36.361 --> 16:39.159
<i>to assign the Mona Lisa
to someone else this year.</i>

16:39.231 --> 16:41.665
<i>Here we are.
Manet's The Balcony.</i>

16:41.733 --> 16:45.396
<i>I know that Gladys has always
been fond of doing the Mona Lisa,</i>

16:45.470 --> 16:48.906
but if the rumor is true that you're
considering replacing her with...

16:48.974 --> 16:52.705
<i>The Balcony, Agatha. We're
working on The Balcony right now.</i>

16:52.778 --> 16:55.042
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

17:00.385 --> 17:04.151
<i>Now, remember, the tilt of
the head, the faint smile,</i>

17:04.222 --> 17:06.849
the hands ever so
slightly apart.

17:07.992 --> 17:09.756
<i>Higgins? Unless the next words you utter are,</i>

17:09.828 --> 17:11.819
"Here are the costumes
you asked me to pick up..."

17:11.896 --> 17:15.696
I need you to keep an eye on
Lily for the next couple of hours.

17:16.268 --> 17:17.701
I'll explain everything
when I get back.

17:17.769 --> 17:19.828
Why in the name of
St. George should I?

17:19.905 --> 17:22.237
'Cause she's
Michelle's daughter.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.579
<i>Unanswered questions.</i>

17:37.656 --> 17:40.523
<i>I used to think that it was in
Vietnam where I first came across</i>

17:40.592 --> 17:43.959
<i>the problem of living
with unanswered questions.</i>

17:44.029 --> 17:46.998
<i>But later, I realized I'd
known about that for years,</i>

17:47.065 --> 17:49.056
<i>probably since
I was five years old.</i>

17:49.134 --> 17:51.932
<i>Questions like, "Why isn't
Dad coming home?"</i>

17:52.003 --> 17:53.994
<i>And, "Where is he?"</i>

17:58.510 --> 18:00.671
<i>Michelle had said she
couldn't give me the answers</i>

18:00.746 --> 18:03.214
<i>to the questions
she knew I must have.</i>

18:03.281 --> 18:06.614
<i>And now there were even greater
questions. Where was Michelle?</i>

18:06.685 --> 18:08.846
<i>And what kind of
trouble was she in?</i>

18:08.920 --> 18:10.717
<i>There was only one person
I could think of</i>

18:10.789 --> 18:13.815
<i>who could definitely
give me some answers.</i>

18:13.892 --> 18:15.257
<i>One scraggly bunch of flowers</i>

18:15.327 --> 18:16.919
<i>will not make up for a canceled dinner date.</i>

18:17.529 --> 18:20.362
<i>Maggie, that hurts. This has
nothing to do with dinner,</i>

18:20.432 --> 18:22.798
<i>for which I'm sorry, by the way.</i>

18:23.268 --> 18:26.726
It's just a little congratulations
present on your promotion.

18:27.773 --> 18:30.435
That was six months ago.
You're a little late!

18:30.509 --> 18:33.034
<i>Well, I thought you had a year
to send congratulations.</i>

18:33.111 --> 18:35.079
<i>That's a wedding, Thomas.</i>

18:35.147 --> 18:38.082
<i>Well, I didn't want to get lost in
the crowd. I was just biding my time.</i>

18:38.150 --> 18:41.313
<i>And besides, you were
in the neighborhood.</i>

18:41.386 --> 18:42.353
I was in the neighborhood.

18:42.421 --> 18:45.219
<i>And coincidentally,
maybe I could...</i>

18:45.290 --> 18:49.090
<i>Maggie, I need your help.</i>

18:57.869 --> 19:00.804
I wondered how long it was
going to take you to find out.

19:00.872 --> 19:02.601
What do you know?

19:02.674 --> 19:04.972
Probably no more than you do.

19:05.043 --> 19:08.501
Two low-ranking Vietnamese army
officers were picked up at the airport.

19:08.580 --> 19:10.070
They aren't talking.

19:10.148 --> 19:13.413
But I suspect the woman
they're after is... Michelle.

19:14.252 --> 19:16.618
<i>I have no idea why she's here, Thomas. None.</i>

19:16.688 --> 19:18.315
Somebody does.

19:18.390 --> 19:20.984
<i>Look, we can't go snooping
around in classified with this.</i>

19:21.059 --> 19:22.356
It's just too hot right now.

19:22.427 --> 19:23.519
<i>Maybe in a couple of days, I can...</i>

19:23.595 --> 19:26.428
<i>She may not have
a couple of days, Maggie.</i>

19:30.836 --> 19:33.805
I'm going to hate myself in the morning.

19:38.877 --> 19:42.176
We've tried every code name
I can think of. Any ideas?

19:42.981 --> 19:45.313
Try Iwo Jima.

19:45.383 --> 19:47.874
Iwo Jima? That's
the wrong war.

19:47.953 --> 19:51.946
Not to Buck Greene.
It's his favorite movie.

19:56.228 --> 19:59.026
<i>Thomas, we're halfway there!
Give me another one.</i>

19:59.097 --> 20:00.860
Try Wayne.

20:00.932 --> 20:02.797
No. Duke!

20:05.570 --> 20:09.062
We got it. We got it. Lookit...

20:09.241 --> 20:12.301
<i>Okay, names of key personnel,</i>

20:12.377 --> 20:15.312
rumored locations of work camps.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.369
Here's something.

20:16.448 --> 20:18.939
Buck's bringing
Michelle's husband in.

20:19.017 --> 20:21.611
Anything about when and how?

20:25.757 --> 20:28.692
No. Just that an assassination
plot has been uncovered.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.990
On General Hue?

20:31.096 --> 20:32.495
Damn it!

20:32.564 --> 20:33.895
They've pulled the plug.

20:33.965 --> 20:34.932
<i>Look, you gotta get out of here</i>

20:35.000 --> 20:36.058
before the cleanup crew comes in!

20:36.134 --> 20:37.863
What if they find out
you're the one who broke in?

20:37.936 --> 20:41.428
<i>Thomas, I can talk my way out
of it, but not if you're here.</i>

20:41.506 --> 20:43.371
<i>Thanks, Maggie.
Yeah.</i>

20:46.745 --> 20:49.578
Thanks for the flowers.

21:00.158 --> 21:03.719
<i>I hadn't realized how long it had
been since I'd been to Little Saigon.</i>

21:03.795 --> 21:05.990
<i>Almost six years.</i>

21:07.032 --> 21:10.297
<i>And I hadn't realized what
going back was going to do to me.</i>

21:10.869 --> 21:12.200
Michelle!

21:19.377 --> 21:20.366
Thomas!

21:21.613 --> 21:25.606
<i>Maybe I'd been avoiding it all
this time without even knowing it.</i>

21:36.895 --> 21:38.328
Any luck?

21:39.431 --> 21:42.423
<i>Me, either. Hey, nobody's gonna talk to us.</i>

21:42.500 --> 21:44.400
What did Michelle say
when you saw her?

21:44.469 --> 21:46.664
I didn't see her.

21:47.472 --> 21:49.838
You do have good reason
to believe she's here?

21:49.908 --> 21:51.341
<i>She's here, all right.</i>

21:51.409 --> 21:56.403
You see an artist's drawing for
about 30 seconds on television.

21:56.481 --> 21:58.278
<i>Come on, Thomas.
You just can't go by that.</i>

21:58.350 --> 22:00.409
There's more than
just a drawing.

22:00.485 --> 22:02.316
There's
a five-year-old child.

22:03.755 --> 22:06.155
<i>Now, somebody here
knows where she is.</i>

22:26.411 --> 22:28.709
What do you want us to do?

22:30.815 --> 22:33.443
Keep looking. Please.

22:54.337 --> 22:55.804
<i>Steady on, men!</i>

22:55.872 --> 22:58.272
One more hill and it's home for Christmas!

22:58.341 --> 23:01.504
<i>I can't do it, Sergeant Higgins.
I'm all battled out, I am.</i>

23:01.578 --> 23:04.308
<i>We can do it, lads!
For the Queen!</i>

23:04.380 --> 23:06.143
<i>Rightio, Guv!</i>

23:09.786 --> 23:11.344
<i>Very nice, Higgins.</i>

23:12.288 --> 23:15.223
<i>Which was that? Monty's
struggle in North Africa,</i>

23:15.291 --> 23:16.553
or the campaign in Burma?

23:16.626 --> 23:17.718
I beg your pardon?

23:17.794 --> 23:21.355
The re-enactment. I just wondered which
famous sofa you conquered during the war.

23:21.431 --> 23:22.420
What on earth
are you talking about?

23:22.499 --> 23:24.967
<i>I was simply looking for a
coin I dropped, a rare coin.</i>

23:25.034 --> 23:26.729
<i>Ah, here it is.</i>

23:26.803 --> 23:28.737
<i>Well, you cleaned up
the place. Thank you.</i>

23:28.805 --> 23:29.829
Quite welcome.

23:29.906 --> 23:31.771
I see you've been shopping.

23:33.076 --> 23:36.136
<i>Oh, just a couple of things
I picked up at Welby's.</i>

23:36.212 --> 23:38.043
I noticed them in the window
while I was waiting for Mario

23:38.114 --> 23:39.809
to come open up
the costume shop.

23:39.883 --> 23:42.147
<i>Oh, yeah. I wanted
to talk to you about that.</i>

23:42.218 --> 23:45.278
I charged them
to Mr. Master's account.

23:45.355 --> 23:48.381
You can pay him back
in easy monthly installments.

23:48.458 --> 23:50.756
I can pay him back?

23:50.827 --> 23:53.694
Unless you'd like to
pay Welby's directly.

23:56.132 --> 23:59.829
You could have told me Michelle was
in town. I would have understood.

24:01.571 --> 24:03.471
I'm not sure I do.

24:06.843 --> 24:10.006
<i>Bonne nuit, lads.
Bonne nuit, Monsieur Higgins.</i>

24:10.880 --> 24:13.110
<i>Bonne nuit, Mademoiselle Hue.</i>

24:13.783 --> 24:16.183
<i>Bonne nuit, Monsieur Higgins.</i>

24:25.295 --> 24:29.095
<i>Well, I think it's time
you got ready for bed.</i>

24:29.232 --> 24:30.221
<i>Bonne nuit.</i>

24:44.280 --> 24:49.115
<i>So the prince placed the
slipper on her foot and it fit.</i>

24:49.986 --> 24:55.083
So he married Cinderella and
they lived happily ever after.

24:57.760 --> 25:01.628
<i>Okay, it's time for you to
go to sleep. You understand?</i>

25:11.941 --> 25:12.930
Doll?

25:17.013 --> 25:18.105
Your doll.

25:21.684 --> 25:23.675
I'm getting it.
I'm getting it.

25:25.221 --> 25:29.385
<i>Yeah, here. See? That's kind
of like a doll, isn't it?</i>

25:30.193 --> 25:31.421
<i>Sort of, huh?</i>

25:34.664 --> 25:36.825
You go to sleep.

25:38.334 --> 25:39.665
There you are.

25:39.736 --> 25:40.725
<i>Maman.</i>

25:50.880 --> 25:51.869
<i>Maman.</i>

26:04.260 --> 26:07.559
Thomas? That's me. Thomas.

26:08.998 --> 26:09.987
Thomas.

26:17.140 --> 26:20.075
Go to sleep. Lay down.
There you go.

26:24.681 --> 26:26.444
<i>Bonne nuit, Thomas.</i>

26:29.619 --> 26:31.553
<i>Bonne nuit, Lily.</i>

27:18.935 --> 27:20.232
<i>Thomas, no.</i>

28:05.848 --> 28:08.146
<i>Michelle, where are you?</i>

28:47.023 --> 28:50.015
I was told I could
come to you for help.

28:50.092 --> 28:53.584
I need to get a message
out of the country.

28:54.730 --> 28:56.254
It's urgent.

28:58.401 --> 29:01.370
It would be disastrous if
it fell into the wrong hands.

29:10.613 --> 29:12.205
Madam Hue?

29:15.184 --> 29:18.176
We know all about
your covert activities.

29:18.254 --> 29:20.154
<i>Your only hope is to tell me
who put you up to this,</i>

29:20.223 --> 29:23.624
and I'll do what I can to keep
it from a general court-martial.

29:24.026 --> 29:25.789
If the Colonel could be
a little more specific...

29:25.862 --> 29:27.625
<i>Damn it, Maggie. You know
what I'm talking about!</i>

29:27.697 --> 29:31.497
What in the hell are you doing
snooping around in classified files?

29:37.240 --> 29:39.572
<i>Morning, Buck. Maggie.</i>

29:40.343 --> 29:41.674
What took you so long?

29:41.744 --> 29:44.508
<i>I told him you were in
a top level meeting, sir.</i>

29:44.580 --> 29:46.741
<i>Dismissed, Lieutenant.
Yes, sir.</i>

29:46.816 --> 29:50.047
<i>That goes for you, too, Maggie. Commander.</i>

29:50.119 --> 29:51.984
Lieutenant Commander Poole.

29:52.521 --> 29:53.613
Thank you.

30:00.496 --> 30:04.091
<i>Well, obviously you didn't find
her, or you wouldn't be here.</i>

30:04.166 --> 30:06.430
<i>Do you ever get insomnia, Buck?</i>

30:06.502 --> 30:08.333
No? I do.

30:09.405 --> 30:12.101
<i>As a matter of fact, I was up
most of last night, just thinking.</i>

30:12.174 --> 30:14.438
And you know what just
kept popping in my mind?

30:14.510 --> 30:16.410
Why don't we just
skip the multiple choice?

30:16.479 --> 30:18.777
<i>I was just thinking, why
would Michelle and her husband</i>

30:18.848 --> 30:22.443
<i>risk coning back here, unless
somebody had offered them protection.</i>

30:24.287 --> 30:26.778
<i>The best laid plans, Magnum.</i>

30:26.856 --> 30:29.484
<i>That not good enough, Buck. Who
are those guys at the airport?</i>

30:29.558 --> 30:33.085
Why are they after Michelle? Where
is Hue? And what the hell is going on?

30:33.162 --> 30:36.325
<i>Look, I can't tell you
anything right now.</i>

30:42.438 --> 30:44.065
You don't know.

30:46.309 --> 30:50.302
You've lost control over there. You
don't have a clue what's going on.

30:50.379 --> 30:53.041
<i>Some times are more fluid
than others, that's all.</i>

30:53.115 --> 30:54.275
You lost him!

30:54.350 --> 30:59.083
<i>If Michelle wants to come in and tell us what
she knows, we can guarantee her protection.</i>

31:00.423 --> 31:03.449
I'm sure she and Hue will
find that real comforting.

31:06.195 --> 31:09.096
General Hue is no longer
of any interest to us.

31:09.165 --> 31:10.826
My only concern
right now is Michelle.

31:10.900 --> 31:13.494
<i>If you find her, I hope
you'll convince her to come in.</i>

31:13.569 --> 31:17.005
I can't think of one
good reason to even try.

31:17.373 --> 31:20.171
Then let me give you one.

31:26.649 --> 31:29.812
Go ahead. Take a look.

32:02.451 --> 32:06.080
<i>That will solve all our
problems, wouldn't it?</i>

32:16.932 --> 32:20.868
They didn't even give him
a military burial.

32:20.936 --> 32:24.064
<i>It's lucky Michelle got out
before they killed her, too.</i>

32:24.907 --> 32:26.238
She doesn't know?

32:26.442 --> 32:29.411
She knows too much
for them to let her live.

32:29.478 --> 32:32.470
<i>We've arranged a new identity, a
new location. We're ready to move.</i>

32:32.548 --> 32:35.608
But we can't do anything
for her if she won't come in.

32:35.684 --> 32:38.619
<i>Now, you can
convince her of that.</i>

32:38.888 --> 32:40.685
<i>No, thanks.</i>

32:41.357 --> 32:43.222
<i>Well, what the hell
are you going to offer her?</i>

32:43.292 --> 32:45.522
Are you gonna lock her up
in your guest house?

32:45.594 --> 32:48.654
Hope these guys
don't come to look for you?

32:48.731 --> 32:52.667
<i>They probably already are. They
got a lot of stuff on you, Magnum.</i>

32:53.102 --> 32:55.536
<i>As long as she's with you,
you're writing her death sentence.</i>

32:55.604 --> 32:59.165
<i>Now, you know that,
even if you won't admit it.</i>

33:03.813 --> 33:06.680
<i>If we move fast, maybe
we can ensure her safety.</i>

33:07.883 --> 33:09.646
And their child's.

33:13.622 --> 33:15.590
It's up to you.

33:32.323 --> 33:35.019
<i>Monsieur Higgins.
Yeah?</i>

33:35.092 --> 33:38.027
<i>Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa.</i>

33:41.432 --> 33:43.696
<i>Yes. Yes, excellent.</i>

33:44.902 --> 33:46.927
Perhaps our best effort.

33:47.238 --> 33:48.899
<i>Really, Jonathan?</i>

33:58.315 --> 34:00.078
<i>Take over for me,
will you, Agatha?</i>

34:00.151 --> 34:02.016
<i>But, Jonathan...</i>

34:06.190 --> 34:08.487
Hey! How's my girl?

34:09.493 --> 34:11.120
<i>Excuse me, doggy.</i>

34:14.165 --> 34:15.893
Did you miss me?

34:15.966 --> 34:17.728
Rick and T.C. Called.

34:17.802 --> 34:21.533
<i>I'm afraid they haven't been able to
penetrate the wall of silence in Little Saigon,</i>

34:21.605 --> 34:24.904
except to find out that someone
else is asking questions.

34:24.975 --> 34:27.569
Perhaps that someone
is Lily's father.

34:38.322 --> 34:40.119
Did you get to talk
to anyone at the consulate?

34:40.190 --> 34:43.092
<i>Oh, yes. They were
quite helpful.</i>

34:45.262 --> 34:47.456
They explained to me
the two Vietnamese gentleman

34:47.531 --> 34:50.500
incarcerated in the Honolulu jail had
already been released and sent home.

34:50.568 --> 34:52.399
<i>Diplomatic immunity.
Immunity, yeah.</i>

34:52.469 --> 34:56.371
<i>Precisely. Perhaps there's something
in the letter you've overlooked,</i>

34:56.440 --> 34:59.876
some hidden clue
to her whereabouts.

35:03.447 --> 35:05.711
<i>In a minute, sweetheart.</i>

35:08.519 --> 35:14.480
<i>Higgins, who do you
think she looks like?</i>

35:15.192 --> 35:16.659
<i>Well, this is hardly the time.</i>

35:16.727 --> 35:18.251
Just look at her.

35:22.399 --> 35:25.334
<i>Well, you can certainly see
her mother's Oriental heritage,</i>

35:25.402 --> 35:26.426
if that's what you mean.

35:26.537 --> 35:28.767
<i>No, I mean,</i>

35:29.106 --> 35:31.734
does she look like anybody else?

35:37.948 --> 35:40.348
<i>Well, it's been six years.</i>

35:41.385 --> 35:43.285
I don't know and...

35:43.821 --> 35:47.655
<i>Why else would Michelle tell her about
the Detroit Tigers and the ring, Higgins?</i>

35:47.725 --> 35:50.216
She recognized this ring.

35:53.631 --> 35:56.998
<i>I know. Okay, it's crazy.
You're right.</i>

35:58.769 --> 36:01.829
It made a hell of a lot of
sense at 4:00 in the morning.

36:07.978 --> 36:09.969
She says it's Sister Mary Rose.

36:10.047 --> 36:13.483
<i>Yeah, I understand
"maman," Higgins.</i>

36:16.153 --> 36:18.280
<i>Thanks, darling.</i>

36:23.694 --> 36:26.857
I thought you'd been
back to the church?

36:27.932 --> 36:31.424
<i>As far as I know, they haven't
tied Lily to the estate yet.</i>

36:31.502 --> 36:32.901
But they're looking for her.

36:32.970 --> 36:34.961
I think she could be safer
at NIA. Can you get her there?

36:35.039 --> 36:36.131
Of course.

36:38.976 --> 36:40.068
Lily.

36:45.149 --> 36:46.138
Lily...

36:47.117 --> 36:49.813
<i>Higgins, tell her
I'm going to get her mother.</i>

36:54.558 --> 36:56.992
She wants to know
about her father.

37:06.971 --> 37:10.168
She says her father
is a very brave man.

37:10.741 --> 37:12.902
I believe she's right.

37:17.047 --> 37:18.344
<i>You have to be brave, too, Lily.</i>

37:18.415 --> 37:21.282
<i>And before you know it,
you'll be with your mother.</i>

37:35.332 --> 37:37.425
<i>Somewhere between the North
Shore and the Pali lookout,</i>

37:37.501 --> 37:39.901
<i>my mind kicked in and started
going over all the stuff.</i>

37:39.970 --> 37:41.665
<i>Buck Greene had said to me.</i>

37:41.739 --> 37:46.199
<i>And I couldn't stop myself from
wondering why this time he had made sense.</i>

37:48.112 --> 37:50.137
<i>Keep safe, my love.</i>

38:11.301 --> 38:12.768
<i>And I couldn't
answer the question</i>

38:12.836 --> 38:15.498
<i>that kept repeating
over and over in my mind.</i>

38:15.572 --> 38:18.507
<i>How could I say goodbye
to Michelle one more time?</i>

38:25.916 --> 38:27.008
Mr. Magnum.

38:27.084 --> 38:28.517
I have to see Michelle.

38:28.585 --> 38:29.609
She isn't here.

38:29.686 --> 38:31.620
<i>Yes, I know. We've been
through that a couple of times,</i>

38:31.688 --> 38:33.451
but I have to see her.
It's very important.

38:33.524 --> 38:34.582
<i>So, just tell her.</i>

38:34.658 --> 38:36.285
She really isn't here.

38:36.593 --> 38:38.584
She left 10 minutes ago.

38:39.496 --> 38:41.293
She left to go where?

38:42.132 --> 38:45.966
I don't know. She received a
message and she left rather quickly.

38:46.036 --> 38:47.936
What was the message?

38:49.139 --> 38:51.869
It would be wrong to read
another's private mail.

38:51.942 --> 38:54.001
<i>Yes, which I'm certain
you would never do.</i>

38:54.078 --> 38:57.047
But if you had
accidentally glanced at it.

38:58.816 --> 39:00.374
Please.

39:03.487 --> 39:06.251
The message said
her husband was here.

39:06.323 --> 39:08.883
<i>She was to come
to the Valley of the Temples.</i>

39:13.931 --> 39:16.456
<i>Madam Hue.
Luang, thank God, you're here!</i>

39:16.533 --> 39:19.229
<i>We haven't much time.
Please, come with me.</i>

39:36.653 --> 39:37.642
Michelle!

39:39.056 --> 39:40.080
Thomas.

39:40.157 --> 39:43.524
<i>Please, Madam Hue, we have no time to
waste! You must come with me quickly.</i>

39:43.594 --> 39:45.357
Don't go with him.

39:45.429 --> 39:47.897
<i>We can't afford a scene!
Please, Madam Hue.</i>

39:47.965 --> 39:49.455
If you value
your husband's life...

39:49.533 --> 39:51.763
<i>Don't listen to him, Michelle!</i>

39:53.704 --> 39:55.501
Come to me.

39:56.039 --> 39:57.506
I can't!

39:58.041 --> 40:00.566
<i>I have to go
to my husband, Thomas.</i>

40:04.381 --> 40:05.814
Nguyen's dead.

40:07.818 --> 40:08.807
What?

40:10.721 --> 40:12.211
<i>He's dead, Michelle.</i>

40:23.934 --> 40:25.561
Thomas!

40:29.740 --> 40:31.435
Thomas!

42:39.936 --> 42:42.166
No! No!

42:42.239 --> 42:43.501
It's all right.

42:45.509 --> 42:47.101
<i>Oh, Thomas.</i>

43:12.169 --> 43:14.000
I could go with you.

43:22.412 --> 43:24.073
You could.

43:26.583 --> 43:31.714
<i>But if I'm with you, you're
just that much easier to find.</i>

43:31.788 --> 43:35.087
I know that and so do you.

43:35.659 --> 43:39.186
They're relentless and they're
not going to let you go so easily.

43:43.467 --> 43:45.401
I could stay here.

43:47.671 --> 43:49.400
You could.

44:11.294 --> 44:12.727
She's very pretty.

44:14.064 --> 44:15.497
Magnum?

44:18.869 --> 44:22.805
<i>We have a plane to catch.
Sergeant, bring the child!</i>

44:40.056 --> 44:41.648
<i>Goodbye, Thomas.</i>

44:47.898 --> 44:49.627
Is Lily my daughter?

44:59.843 --> 45:05.213
<i>If I say, "Yes, she is your daughter,"
Thomas, would you let her go?</i>

45:15.792 --> 45:18.556
I promise she will
never forget you.

45:19.629 --> 45:22.154
I will see to that.

45:28.972 --> 45:31.304
Will you promise me something?

45:34.978 --> 45:37.469
When the world
is a different place...
