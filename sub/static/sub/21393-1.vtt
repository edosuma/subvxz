00:53.550 --> 00:57.010
~Ground Control to Major Tom~

00:57.050 --> 01:00.560
~Seven... Six~

01:00.640 --> 01:04.060
~Commencing countdown engines on~

01:05.019 --> 01:07.730
~Three... Two~

01:07.940 --> 01:14.320
~Check ignition and may God's love
Be with you~

01:25.290 --> 01:29.500
~This is Ground Control to Major Tom~

01:30.050 --> 01:33.500
~You've really made the grade~

01:35.010 --> 01:40.350
~And the papers want to know
Whose shirts you wear~

01:41.980 --> 01:48.190
~Now it's time to leave
The capsule if you dare~

01:49.940 --> 01:54.140
~This is Major Tom to Ground Control~

01:54.950 --> 01:57.780
~I'm stepping through the door~

01:59.700 --> 02:04.900
~And I'm floating
In a most peculiar way~

02:06.790 --> 02:12.670
~And the stars
Look very different today~

02:14.130 --> 02:20.640
~For here
Am I sitting in a tin can~

02:21.850 --> 02:28.100
~Far above the world~

02:28.820 --> 02:35.030
~Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do~

02:58.390 --> 03:02.640
~Though I'm past
One hundred thousand miles~

03:03.350 --> 03:06.020
~I'm feeling very still~

03:08.150 --> 03:13.320
~And I think my spaceship knows
Which way to go~

03:15.200 --> 03:20.950
~Tell my wife I love her very much
She knows~

03:22.870 --> 03:27.410
~Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead~

03:27.910 --> 03:32.090
~There's something wrong
Can you hear me Major Tom~

03:32.840 --> 03:35.300
~Can you hear me Major Tom~

03:36.210 --> 03:42.760
~Can you
Here am I floating round my tin can~

03:43.760 --> 03:48.730
~Far above the moon~

03:50.520 --> 03:57.110
~Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do~

04:00.780 --> 04:03.280
"The Alpha intergalactic space station"

04:03.360 --> 04:05.410
has reached critical mass in orbit.

04:05.950 --> 04:07.780
"Its weight and size now pose"

04:07.870 --> 04:10.160
"a serious threat to mother earth."

04:12.370 --> 04:14.250
"In its great wisdom,
the central committee"

04:14.330 --> 04:16.790
"has decided to use
all resources necessary"

04:16.880 --> 04:20.300
to release this space station
from the earth's gravity.

04:22.840 --> 04:25.800
"Its new course is set
for the Magellan current."

04:25.890 --> 04:27.890
"Like the great explorer Magellan,"

04:27.970 --> 04:31.520
the Alpha station
will journey into the unknown.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.850
A symbol of our values and knowledge.

04:35.480 --> 04:38.440
It will carry a message of peace and unity

04:38.520 --> 04:40.730
"to the farthest reaches of the universe."

04:41.230 --> 04:43.700
"Our thoughts and prayers go with you."

04:44.490 --> 04:47.450
Godspeed and good luck.

05:34.300 --> 05:36.300
[Good morning.]

05:59.730 --> 06:01.020
[Ah...]

06:06.060 --> 06:16.060
FarangSiam thanks you.
Enjoy!

06:21.800 --> 06:23.800
[Stay here.]

06:32.000 --> 06:33.300
[- Good morning.
- Good morning.]

06:33.500 --> 06:34.500
[Good morning.]

06:35.250 --> 06:36.550
[Good morning.]

06:39.500 --> 06:41.500
[Good morning.]

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
[Let's go on.]

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
[Good morning.]

07:12.030 --> 07:14.030
[- Good morning.
- Good morning.]

07:14.250 --> 07:16.250
[Good morning.]

08:01.010 --> 08:03.010
[Let us give back to nature,]

08:03.390 --> 08:05.100
[that which she gave to us.]

08:13.850 --> 08:14.900
[Give this Pearl]

08:14.980 --> 08:16.900
[to my daughter, Princess Lihö.]

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
[What is that?]

09:44.030 --> 09:45.530
[Fast shelter!]

09:45.900 --> 09:46.900
[Come on, quickly!]

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
[- What happened?
- There are objects falling from the sky.]

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
[Oh my goodness...]

10:00.500 --> 10:04.800
[Secure all people,
bring them to a safe place.]

10:04.850 --> 10:06.000
[Come on, hurry.]

10:29.800 --> 10:32.000
[Wait.]

11:00.630 --> 11:01.630
[Dolark!]

11:13.000 --> 11:15.500
[They are coming.]

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
[Quickly, take cover!]

11:27.000 --> 11:28.750
[- Wait...
- Come on!]

11:29.000 --> 11:30.900
[- All gather!
- Come on!]

11:31.000 --> 11:32.700
[- Faster!
- Faster!]

11:32.750 --> 11:36.050
[- Come on, quickly!
- Come on.]

11:42.500 --> 11:43.960
[It's broken!]

11:44.750 --> 11:46.550
[Aksha!]

11:46.660 --> 11:47.720
[Lihö!]

11:48.250 --> 11:50.050
[I'm sorry.]

11:54.500 --> 11:56.200
[- No!
- Please.]

11:56.710 --> 11:57.880
[Lihö!]

12:13.800 --> 12:14.750
[Lihö!]

12:14.790 --> 12:15.790
[No!]

12:22.180 --> 12:23.560
[Lihö!]

12:24.500 --> 12:26.500
[Goodbye.]

12:48.460 --> 12:50.670
- You okay?
- Yeah. Just a...

12:51.670 --> 12:52.580
Bad dream.

12:53.630 --> 12:54.540
No.

12:56.020 --> 12:58.900
- Hey!
- But I feel better now.

12:58.980 --> 13:00.980
Don't you think we should run
through our assignment?

13:01.020 --> 13:02.730
That's the last thing I feel like doing.

13:05.030 --> 13:06.280
Not very professional, major.

13:06.360 --> 13:09.910
Look, I scored a perfect 200
on my last memory test.

13:09.990 --> 13:13.620
Impressive. Unfortunately you've forgotten
something rather important today.

13:15.160 --> 13:16.580
- What's that?
- My birthday.

13:17.900 --> 13:18.820
Hey!

13:22.900 --> 13:24.250
What can I do to make it up to you?

13:24.490 --> 13:26.160
"Beginning descent in three minutes."

13:28.370 --> 13:30.200
Nothing that you can get done
in three minutes.

13:33.210 --> 13:34.040
Come on.

13:34.120 --> 13:36.040
Don't start what you can't finish.

13:36.380 --> 13:39.170
"Landing on planet Kyrian in five minutes."

13:39.250 --> 13:41.550
Sorry. Hey, look.

13:42.160 --> 13:44.180
I know you're attracted to me.
Why deny the obvious?

13:44.220 --> 13:45.760
- It's obvious?
- Yeah, sure.

13:45.840 --> 13:47.930
Little goody two-shoes
with an Ivy league education

13:48.010 --> 13:50.270
are always attracted to galaxy-hopping
bad boys like me.

13:50.350 --> 13:54.440
My Ivy league education taught me
to steer clear from bad boys like you.

13:54.520 --> 13:57.020
Yeah, well, you're not going to find
better than me on the market.

13:57.230 --> 13:59.020
Straight up. Take a good look.

13:59.480 --> 14:00.610
Handsome, intelligent...

14:00.690 --> 14:02.320
- Modest.
- Brave.

14:02.400 --> 14:03.740
- Suicidal.
- Determined.

14:03.820 --> 14:05.570
- Pig-headed.
- Faithful.

14:05.660 --> 14:07.950
- To yourself.
- Yeah, and to you.

14:08.030 --> 14:10.120
- You're my partner.
- Yeah, don't forget it.

14:11.870 --> 14:14.910
Look, why don't you think with your heart
and not your head for once?

14:15.120 --> 14:16.460
I don't wanna be another name

14:16.540 --> 14:18.330
on your list of conquests,
thank you very much.

14:18.330 --> 14:19.810
What are you talking about? What list?

14:19.820 --> 14:21.310
Alex, can we see the playlist, please?

14:21.320 --> 14:23.320
No, no. No, no, no. Hey.

14:23.800 --> 14:25.550
Most of those are coworkers,
and that's it.

14:25.630 --> 14:26.800
Coworkers?

14:27.550 --> 14:29.350
Right, where's my picture then?

14:29.430 --> 14:31.810
They mean nothing to me. Okay?

14:31.820 --> 14:33.430
I took a few detours when I was younger.

14:33.430 --> 14:34.980
Your last detour was not so long ago.

14:34.990 --> 14:36.320
Yeah, but with you it's different.

14:36.330 --> 14:37.240
And you know it.

14:37.900 --> 14:40.150
I want my heart to belong to you
and no one else.

14:40.900 --> 14:44.400
My heart will belong to a man
who will erase his playlist for me.

14:47.070 --> 14:48.230
That's what I'm talking about.

14:50.530 --> 14:51.490
I'm that man.

14:53.450 --> 14:56.210
Look, we both know
you're quite a ladykiller.

14:56.660 --> 14:59.670
So why do you lose interest in a girl
as soon as you win her heart?

14:59.920 --> 15:01.540
'Cause I'm looking for the perfect woman.

15:02.460 --> 15:04.170
But you've never stopped to look.

15:04.670 --> 15:05.800
That's not a crime.

15:06.300 --> 15:07.760
No, it's not a crime.

15:08.680 --> 15:09.590
But just admit it,

15:10.260 --> 15:12.390
you're scared of commitment.

15:12.850 --> 15:14.100
Me? Scared of commitment?

15:14.850 --> 15:15.770
Are you kidding me?

15:16.480 --> 15:17.600
Nine years in the service.

15:18.600 --> 15:19.600
Impeccable record.

15:20.440 --> 15:21.520
Seven medals of honor.

15:22.070 --> 15:23.440
Never lost a partner.

15:23.530 --> 15:24.480
Yeah, until now.

15:25.150 --> 15:26.070
"Refuel complete."

15:30.120 --> 15:31.570
Alex, did you enter the coordinates?

15:31.660 --> 15:33.240
"I took that Liberty, so you could both"

15:33.330 --> 15:34.990
"enjoy the beach a while longer."

15:35.080 --> 15:37.250
- Oh, thank you.
"- You are welcome."

15:37.500 --> 15:39.620
"You will be leaving exospace
in 30 seconds."

15:39.900 --> 15:41.340
- You wanna take us down?
- Yes, sir.

15:41.350 --> 15:43.830
Alex, will you pull up my brain charts
for the past 10 minutes?

15:43.830 --> 15:44.950
I had a weird dream.

15:47.590 --> 15:48.630
See anything abnormal?

15:48.970 --> 15:52.180
"Your cerebral activity is
a little more intense than usual."

15:52.260 --> 15:55.180
"- You received external waves."
- Explain.

15:55.600 --> 15:57.480
"These waves don't come from your memory."

15:57.810 --> 15:59.640
"Somebody is sending you the images."

15:59.850 --> 16:02.020
- Do you know who? Where they come from?
"- Negative."

16:02.360 --> 16:04.320
"They could come from the present or past."

16:04.400 --> 16:06.360
"And from anywhere in the universe."

16:06.440 --> 16:07.490
Leaving exospace.

16:08.570 --> 16:11.570
"Three, two, one... exit."

16:25.460 --> 16:26.590
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:26.670 --> 16:27.670
- Easy, easy.
- We're late.

16:27.710 --> 16:29.130
Yeah, well, better late than dead.

16:29.340 --> 16:30.220
Do you wanna drive?

16:30.300 --> 16:32.430
Whoa! Put your hand back on the joystick.

16:33.300 --> 16:35.070
Laureline, put your hand back
on the joystick.

16:36.460 --> 16:38.820
Laureline, will you please
put your hand back on the joystick?

16:38.830 --> 16:40.520
Will you stop complaining about my driving?

16:40.530 --> 16:42.090
Yes, I'm sorry. You're a great driver.

16:42.090 --> 16:43.890
You're the best driver
in the entire universe.

16:43.900 --> 16:45.650
Aw. Thank you.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.950
"- Intercom activated. "
- Thanks.

16:58.540 --> 17:00.460
Touchdown on Kyrian in two minutes.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.460
"Minister on line."

17:04.040 --> 17:06.540
- Sir?
"- Agents Valerian and Laureline,"

17:06.630 --> 17:09.300
"I trust you've studied the assignment.
So as soon as you land,"

17:09.380 --> 17:11.170
"recover the converter
and bring it to Alpha"

17:11.260 --> 17:12.880
"for a top-secret operation."

17:13.260 --> 17:15.430
"The converter is the last
creature of his species,"

17:15.510 --> 17:17.140
"- so we're counting on you."
- Yes, sir.

17:17.220 --> 17:19.099
"Captain Gibson has further details."

17:19.180 --> 17:21.480
"And please, put on some
more appropriate clothing."

17:22.099 --> 17:23.770
Good idea. Leaving manual.

17:24.230 --> 17:25.359
"Manual disarmed."

17:27.690 --> 17:29.150
"Intercom activated."

17:31.490 --> 17:33.030
Here they come. Intruder 980.

17:33.860 --> 17:34.950
Check parameters.

17:36.030 --> 17:37.910
Two people on board. No parasites.

17:57.970 --> 17:58.890
Where's the band?

17:59.310 --> 18:01.230
You plan on going on a mission
dressed like that?

18:01.430 --> 18:03.320
We're supposed to mingle with tourists,
aren't we?

18:03.360 --> 18:05.790
What do you expect us to wear?
A panda suit?

18:05.800 --> 18:06.710
Nice hat.

18:18.490 --> 18:19.800
Major, this mission is in-and-out.

18:20.080 --> 18:22.120
You enter big market,
you find the suspect's store,

18:22.200 --> 18:23.630
and you team up with sergeant Cooper.

18:23.660 --> 18:25.460
- I only work with my partner.
- Hi.

18:25.540 --> 18:26.460
We're a team.

18:26.900 --> 18:28.550
Sergeant Laureline will arrive at the drop

18:28.580 --> 18:31.350
in exactly 20 minutes, and you will have
10 seconds to make the transfer.

18:32.010 --> 18:33.050
Didn't you read the memo?

18:34.550 --> 18:36.510
Yeah. Of course.

18:36.590 --> 18:37.510
You better have.

18:42.270 --> 18:44.810
How about we look at the memo one
last time?

18:45.770 --> 18:46.690
Can't hurt.

19:09.170 --> 19:11.090
Think you can survive 20 minutes
without me?

19:11.170 --> 19:12.590
How could I possibly?

19:13.300 --> 19:15.050
Go on. Be careful.

19:15.550 --> 19:17.760
Oh, you must be right.

19:18.970 --> 19:21.300
I completely forgot,
I have a question for you.

19:22.470 --> 19:23.390
Shoot.

19:24.850 --> 19:25.770
What?

19:28.560 --> 19:29.480
Will you marry me?

19:30.480 --> 19:32.940
- Not funny.
- Laureline, I'm serious.

19:34.130 --> 19:36.590
I've been thinking about what you said
earlier and you're right.

19:36.600 --> 19:37.910
I need to move onward and upward.

19:37.920 --> 19:39.000
I need to commit.

19:39.010 --> 19:40.720
Here? Just like that?

19:40.730 --> 19:42.540
Yeah. Why not?
They sell a zillion things here.

19:42.560 --> 19:44.810
I'm sure we can find a priest
who'd be happy to oblige.

19:47.500 --> 19:48.410
Go.

19:52.920 --> 19:53.840
Okay, let's go.

20:18.820 --> 20:20.660
"We remind you that if you want to enjoy"

20:20.740 --> 20:22.030
"the experience of big market,"

20:22.280 --> 20:24.490
"you must put on equipment available
to you."

20:24.780 --> 20:25.700
"Thank you."

20:32.500 --> 20:34.340
Welcome, everybody. Welcome.

20:34.420 --> 20:36.250
Please gather around, gather around.

20:36.340 --> 20:38.050
Now, my name is Thaziit,

20:38.130 --> 20:40.470
and I am your guide for today, okay?

20:40.550 --> 20:42.930
Now, whose first time
is this at big market?

20:43.220 --> 20:45.180
Lovely, lovely. Wonderful, wonderful.

20:45.260 --> 20:49.060
Now, let me remind you
that big market is in another dimension.

20:49.140 --> 20:51.230
You won't be able to see it
without your helmet,

20:51.310 --> 20:53.730
or touch it without your gloves.

20:56.150 --> 21:00.070
For there are nearly a million stores
in big market.

21:00.530 --> 21:02.240
Yes, okay, we have one hour.

21:02.320 --> 21:05.410
Now, please watch the letters at the top,

21:05.490 --> 21:10.040
and verify that the «u» for human
is full green, okay?

21:10.410 --> 21:12.790
So, everybody please, get together,

21:12.870 --> 21:14.960
right behind your guide, whose name is?

21:15.040 --> 21:17.920
- Thaziit!
- Thaziit! Come on, let's go!

21:19.340 --> 21:21.470
Okay, follow me.
Please, put your helmets on.

21:21.920 --> 21:23.840
Come through the gates. Okay?

21:23.930 --> 21:25.890
Activate your system. Wonderful.

21:27.010 --> 21:28.350
"Do not leave your helmet."

21:28.430 --> 21:29.770
"System activated."

21:35.350 --> 21:36.360
Whoa...

21:38.270 --> 21:40.740
Welcome to big market.

22:05.760 --> 22:07.430
Hi.

22:07.510 --> 22:09.010
Yes, sure, of course. Bill?

22:09.390 --> 22:11.180
Can I have my camera, please? Thank you.

22:11.810 --> 22:13.140
Say cheese.

22:15.600 --> 22:16.520
Thank you, bill.

22:27.070 --> 22:28.660
- You're good.
- Thanks.

22:35.870 --> 22:36.790
Hey.

22:38.880 --> 22:42.550
~Come with me~

22:42.640 --> 22:46.140
~Stand by me~

22:46.640 --> 22:48.560
~- Stars are sweet~
- Good luck.

22:48.640 --> 22:50.640
- What the hell are you doing, soldier?
- Sorry, sir.

22:50.660 --> 22:51.990
Keep an eye on the guy, all right?

22:52.010 --> 22:52.930
Yes, sir.

23:32.050 --> 23:33.720
Please be careful down the stairs.

23:34.180 --> 23:35.470
Come on, everyone.

23:36.600 --> 23:38.940
- Just think baby a million stores.
- Yeah.

23:39.400 --> 23:41.480
Only stuff that we can carry, okay?

23:41.810 --> 23:43.070
- I promise.
- All right.

24:01.750 --> 24:03.210
All right, drop in 12 minutes.

24:03.290 --> 24:04.210
Copy that.

24:27.650 --> 24:28.900
I found the suspect's store.

24:29.320 --> 24:32.820
"Good. Sergeant Cooper will help you get in
and recover the stolen property."

24:51.380 --> 24:53.090
- Major Valerian.
- Sergeant Cooper.

24:53.760 --> 24:56.600
As you read in the memo, you need glasses
to see the other dimension,

24:56.680 --> 24:58.810
and a trans-matter box
to bring anything there.

25:00.560 --> 25:02.520
- Especially a gun.
"- Authorized."

25:03.770 --> 25:04.690
Put this on.

25:06.980 --> 25:08.780
Enter your genetic code
on the front keypad.

25:08.860 --> 25:11.650
To come back, enter your genetic code
on the back keypad.

25:11.740 --> 25:13.110
- Clear?
- Crystal.

25:24.080 --> 25:25.580
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

25:34.890 --> 25:37.680
Hey, Tsfluri. Good to see you again.

25:37.760 --> 25:39.350
Please, sit down.

25:41.060 --> 25:42.310
Do you have what we asked for?

25:42.390 --> 25:43.310
Yeah, yeah.

25:44.150 --> 25:45.150
But it was a toughie.

25:55.490 --> 25:57.700
I lost a lot of personnel
getting this for you.

25:58.450 --> 26:01.750
But this thing is priceless.

26:02.460 --> 26:03.960
What can you give me in exchange?

26:17.220 --> 26:18.930
Amazing.

26:22.020 --> 26:24.310
I never thought I'd see one in my lifetime.

26:24.640 --> 26:25.850
You'll have hundreds of them.

26:25.940 --> 26:28.150
Just as soon as you give us
what we came for.

26:28.230 --> 26:29.150
Oh...

26:29.610 --> 26:32.360
That's where I have a slight problem,
my friends.

26:32.440 --> 26:34.900
If you're going to knock out
copies of this baby for me,

26:35.110 --> 26:36.570
why shouldn't I do it for myself?

26:38.780 --> 26:41.950
Hey, hey. Easy, my little lambs.

26:45.410 --> 26:46.920
We absolutely need this converter.

26:47.290 --> 26:49.000
You know we are fighting for a noble cause.

26:49.080 --> 26:52.090
I know. And I'm fighting for a noble cause,
too.

26:52.800 --> 26:53.710
Mine.

26:54.840 --> 26:56.760
You have 10 seconds to drop your guns.

26:57.680 --> 26:58.590
Hmm?

26:59.550 --> 27:00.470
Showtime.

27:06.140 --> 27:07.310
Five...

27:11.690 --> 27:12.610
Four...

27:15.110 --> 27:16.030
Three...

27:18.030 --> 27:18.950
Two...

27:20.910 --> 27:21.830
One...

27:22.790 --> 27:24.290
"Federal agent Valerian."

27:24.660 --> 27:27.670
Sorry to interrupt this great deal,
but I'm also here for a noble cause.

27:28.000 --> 27:28.920
It's called the law.

27:31.360 --> 27:33.190
Hey, haven't I seen you guys
somewhere before?

27:33.250 --> 27:36.470
Hey, I'm not running a tearoom here.
What do you want from me?

27:36.550 --> 27:38.260
Igon Siruss, you stand accused of stealing

27:38.340 --> 27:40.340
a Mül converter belonging to
the federation.

27:40.430 --> 27:42.180
But before I drag your ass in,

27:42.970 --> 27:44.890
I have to recover the stolen property.

27:45.520 --> 27:47.520
"- All right, how we doing? "
- Almost there.

27:47.600 --> 27:49.650
Valerian, I'll be to your left
at 3 o'clock.

27:49.730 --> 27:51.440
- Three meters away.
- Got you.

27:52.940 --> 27:54.480
Guys, don't move.

28:01.700 --> 28:05.240
Now, take it nice and easy
and push it into the box.

28:08.290 --> 28:09.920
- Converter in the box.
- Copy.

28:16.460 --> 28:17.970
Undetected. Back to base.

28:18.050 --> 28:19.090
"- Good job."
- Copy that.

28:19.380 --> 28:21.470
- Valerian, get out of here.
- I'm on my way.

28:33.610 --> 28:36.030
I'll find you, federal agent Valerian.

28:36.400 --> 28:38.400
Wherever you are in the universe,

28:38.990 --> 28:39.950
I'll find you.

28:41.110 --> 28:42.450
And I will kill you.

28:43.120 --> 28:44.160
Good luck.

29:02.680 --> 29:03.590
Valerian's in trouble.

29:03.740 --> 29:06.060
Mission takes priority. Keep going.

29:06.070 --> 29:07.530
- Cooper, cover him.
- Copy that.

29:30.580 --> 29:33.040
"Seek and destroy. Top priority."

29:33.580 --> 29:35.080
"Target's photograph to follow."

29:38.840 --> 29:40.590
- Valerian, how we doing?
- Good.

29:41.470 --> 29:42.300
I think I lost them.

29:42.380 --> 29:43.720
- Are you thirsty?
- No, thank you.

29:43.800 --> 29:45.390
I'm to your left, 200 feet away.

29:45.470 --> 29:47.010
My keypad's broken.

29:47.100 --> 29:48.760
- You need some energy?
- No, thank you.

29:48.850 --> 29:50.930
The box is broken.
I can't get my arm back.

29:51.810 --> 29:53.100
Hey, you need a lawyer?

29:54.230 --> 29:56.650
Federal agent on duty. Leave me alone.

30:01.940 --> 30:03.570
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

30:26.840 --> 30:28.060
"Valerian, what are you doing?"

31:04.090 --> 31:05.010
Da!

31:06.840 --> 31:07.890
Very funny.

31:08.890 --> 31:09.800
What's your name?

31:10.470 --> 31:11.850
- Da.
- Da?

31:15.270 --> 31:17.390
Come here. Come here. Try this.

31:18.230 --> 31:19.350
It's way more fun.

31:21.980 --> 31:22.900
Da.

31:26.200 --> 31:27.110
Solong.

31:33.740 --> 31:36.830
Da! Da! Da! Da!

31:36.910 --> 31:38.830
Yeah, yeah, there's a time for everything,
kid.

31:38.920 --> 31:40.250
Don't you have homework to do?

31:44.050 --> 31:46.840
All right, go get yourself cleaned up,
run to mommy.

31:50.970 --> 31:52.260
- Mommy?
- Da.

31:55.310 --> 31:56.230
Watch out!

32:12.280 --> 32:13.200
Sorry!

32:22.000 --> 32:24.920
"To retrieve your purchases
please place your items"

32:25.000 --> 32:29.050
"in the transmitter box
and enter your DNA code. Thank you."

32:30.180 --> 32:32.590
Amazing. And so practical.

32:32.680 --> 32:33.680
Useless, you mean.

32:33.760 --> 32:35.840
You don't even know what
you'll do with the darn thing.

32:35.890 --> 32:38.310
Don't be such a grouch. It's decorative.

32:38.390 --> 32:40.940
Try to be civilized for once.

32:43.230 --> 32:45.480
Civilized. Yeah, sure.

32:50.820 --> 32:52.070
- Watch out!
- Sorry!

32:54.410 --> 32:55.330
Hey!

33:07.000 --> 33:08.170
Hey!

33:08.590 --> 33:10.720
Hey! Hey! Hey, thanks a lot!

33:10.800 --> 33:11.720
Sorry!

33:18.560 --> 33:20.770
- I didn't see the wall.
- Need some help?

33:20.850 --> 33:22.480
I just need you to fix my arm, thanks.

33:36.040 --> 33:37.540
I suppose, since you asked for my hand,

33:37.630 --> 33:39.340
you should probably get yours back first.

33:39.420 --> 33:41.590
- Is that a yes?
- Don't move.

33:44.130 --> 33:45.760
How can I help you if you keep moving?

33:45.840 --> 33:47.040
Will you just hurry up, please?

33:48.760 --> 33:49.850
Please keep still.

33:53.730 --> 33:54.640
You've been detected.

33:55.100 --> 33:58.230
Uh... sorry to bother you.

33:58.310 --> 34:00.230
I'm out of ammo and there's three
headed my way.

34:00.320 --> 34:01.480
Give me one second.

34:02.780 --> 34:04.820
I don't have a second.

34:04.900 --> 34:06.360
- Okay, you're good.
- Thanks!

34:17.790 --> 34:19.540
I don't know what I'd do without you.

34:32.270 --> 34:35.270
"To retrieve your purchases,
please place your items"

34:35.350 --> 34:39.020
"in the transmitter box,
and enter your DNA code."

34:39.400 --> 34:40.320
"Thank you."

34:47.239 --> 34:48.409
Fetch.

34:49.199 --> 34:50.199
"You've been detected."

34:50.290 --> 34:51.639
"Keep moving, don't change course."

34:51.699 --> 34:53.710
- What are we supposed to do?
- Run.

34:57.500 --> 34:59.130
- Zito, cover them.
- Yes, sir!

35:20.070 --> 35:21.230
Get! Get in!

35:21.320 --> 35:22.940
Come on, let's go! Go, go, go!

35:23.030 --> 35:24.470
I'm coming, I'm coming! I'm coming!

35:37.830 --> 35:40.000
Zito, get that thing off our backs.

35:43.710 --> 35:44.630
I got it.

35:49.390 --> 35:50.760
Guys, take it out! Take it out!

36:24.000 --> 36:25.260
Alex, we need you right now!

36:33.220 --> 36:34.140
Let's go!

37:12.010 --> 37:14.100
Shoot. He ruined my dress.

37:14.180 --> 37:15.640
Alex, I'm gonna take over on manual.

37:15.720 --> 37:17.470
Prepare to enter exospace.

37:22.720 --> 37:24.450
You know the coordinates
for the rendezvous?

37:24.480 --> 37:26.320
Yeah, I'm just deciphering them.

37:27.320 --> 37:29.240
- Alex, what was that?
"- We have a stowaway."

37:31.150 --> 37:33.370
Oh, great. Hold on.

37:37.240 --> 37:40.040
"Major Valerian, you're running
nearly 20 minutes late."

37:40.120 --> 37:41.920
Yeah, well, time flies
when you're having fun.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.670
- We have the Mül converter.
"- Excellent."

37:43.750 --> 37:46.960
"Now perhaps you can tell me
what you're doing 17 light-years"

37:46.980 --> 37:49.080
"- from your rendezvous?"
- Yeah. It sounds pretty grim

37:49.090 --> 37:51.390
when you put it like that.
But when I say we'll be there in

37:51.400 --> 37:54.100
- nine minutes, does that sound better?
"- I'll inform the commander."

37:54.110 --> 37:56.280
"that you're behind schedule,
and pass on your apology."

37:56.300 --> 37:57.350
Yeah, you do that.

38:00.770 --> 38:02.690
Leaving exospace in five seconds.

38:02.770 --> 38:04.900
Somebody's gonna land with a bang.

38:20.960 --> 38:23.460
Okay, let's have a look at you.

38:25.380 --> 38:27.300
Not at me, tiger. Come on.

38:28.380 --> 38:30.760
Don't be scared. I'll look after you.

38:30.850 --> 38:32.930
Come on.

38:34.520 --> 38:35.430
Hello.

38:37.140 --> 38:38.060
Wow.

38:38.480 --> 38:40.980
You have the most incredible eyes.

38:44.070 --> 38:45.190
Okay, you're a little scabby.

38:45.280 --> 38:48.820
So why don't we get you a nice treatment
so you can get your mojo back?

38:50.240 --> 38:51.120
Sound good?

38:51.200 --> 38:53.790
Come on.

39:01.590 --> 39:03.930
Some high-grade uranium
and you'll be good as new.

39:09.140 --> 39:10.060
Hang on, tiger.

39:20.530 --> 39:21.450
Alex?

39:23.120 --> 39:24.200
Analyze this, please.

39:26.050 --> 39:27.920
Power, 20 megatons?

39:28.300 --> 39:32.550
"Indeed. There's 10 times more power
in that Pearl than in our entire ship."

39:32.640 --> 39:33.510
Where's it come from'?

39:33.590 --> 39:37.430
"From Mül, a planet that was
in the constellation qn34."

39:37.720 --> 39:39.020
- Was?
"- Yes."

39:39.100 --> 39:42.400
"The planet no longer exists,
and hasn't for 30 years."

39:42.940 --> 39:44.110
Let's see what it looked like.

39:45.150 --> 39:46.320
"Abundant vegetation,"

39:46.770 --> 39:49.610
"a few primal species,
but of no particular interest."

39:49.860 --> 39:53.410
The one in my dream was pretty...
interesting.

39:54.660 --> 39:55.580
Zoom in.

39:57.290 --> 40:00.120
- Use our access codes.
"- I'm afraid that won't be enough, major."

40:00.200 --> 40:01.660
"Access is restricted."

40:01.960 --> 40:02.870
To what rank?

40:03.290 --> 40:05.290
"General. Five stars."

40:08.170 --> 40:11.380
The creature in my dream, she had a Pearl
just like that on her neck.

40:11.470 --> 40:12.380
"Noted, major."

40:13.930 --> 40:15.890
"Leaving exospace in one minute."

40:16.680 --> 40:19.350
He's very cute, you know.
And a real charmer.

40:19.810 --> 40:21.020
You may have some competition.

40:21.680 --> 40:23.440
I'm fine with competition.

40:26.520 --> 40:28.400
Hey, I'm still waiting for your answer.

40:29.780 --> 40:33.860
I know I can be full of myself sometimes,
but I'm dead serious about my proposal.

40:33.950 --> 40:35.910
We have to complete the mission, major.

40:35.990 --> 40:38.030
There's still the top secret part
to attend to.

40:38.580 --> 40:40.580
Or is your perfect memory failing you
again?

40:41.370 --> 40:42.290
"Seat belt."

40:44.920 --> 40:45.830
You know what?

40:47.250 --> 40:49.050
I'm gonna ask for 10 days' leave right now,

40:49.130 --> 40:51.960
and I'm gonna take you to the most
beautiful beach in the whole universe.

40:52.050 --> 40:54.260
A real beach this time.

40:54.340 --> 40:57.390
The perfect place for a honeymoon.

40:57.970 --> 41:01.020
"- Ten seconds."
- The honeymoon comes after the wedding.

41:01.100 --> 41:02.020
You know that, right?

41:03.140 --> 41:04.890
- Really?
- Yup.

41:04.980 --> 41:08.400
"Three, two, one. Decelerating."

41:10.610 --> 41:11.940
Whoa!

41:12.030 --> 41:13.490
Alex, what are you doing?

41:13.570 --> 41:15.570
"Sorry, too much traffic."

41:15.660 --> 41:19.240
- Do you want me to drive?
- Nope. No, no. No, thank you.

41:26.710 --> 41:28.130
"Welcome to Alpha,"

41:28.210 --> 41:30.340
"the city of a thousand planets."

41:33.710 --> 41:35.300
Alex, can you update us?

41:35.380 --> 41:36.590
"I'd be delighted to."

41:37.130 --> 41:39.850
"The Alpha station has grown 7% this year,"

41:40.720 --> 41:45.770
"and since it left the terrestrial orbit,
it has traveled almost 700 million miles."

41:47.650 --> 41:48.520
Population?

41:48.600 --> 41:52.900
"Almost 30 million. 3,236 species"

41:52.980 --> 41:55.400
"from the four corners of the universe
live on board,"

41:55.950 --> 41:57.610
"pooling their knowledge and cultures."

41:58.280 --> 42:02.830
"Over 5,000 languages spoken, not counting
the various computer languages."

42:03.330 --> 42:04.250
Demographics?

42:04.540 --> 42:06.460
"To the south are the submerged parts,"

42:06.540 --> 42:11.000
"with 800 species living
in all kinds of liquids."

42:11.010 --> 42:13.620
"Such as the peaceful Poulong farmers
who grow cobalt."

42:14.550 --> 42:18.840
"To the north, we have gaseous lands
dominated by the Azin M6,"

42:18.930 --> 42:21.470
"whose extreme sensitivity
makes them specialists"

42:21.550 --> 42:24.520
"in neurosciences
and molecular components."

42:24.970 --> 42:26.770
"They can build cells of any kind."

42:27.350 --> 42:30.230
"To the east of them,
the large colony of Omelites."

42:30.560 --> 42:34.190
"They control information technology,
finance, and banking."

42:35.150 --> 42:37.860
"Finally, to the west,
in a pressurized atmosphere,"

42:37.950 --> 42:40.990
"we have 9 million humans
and compatible species."

42:41.070 --> 42:42.030
Home sweet home.

42:42.240 --> 42:44.620
"The economy has been in shambles
for a year."

42:44.990 --> 42:48.710
"- Do you want a quick summary? "
- No. That's enough excitement for one day.

42:55.380 --> 42:56.920
Intruder xb982.

42:57.010 --> 42:58.930
Authorization to dock in section 1.

42:59.010 --> 43:00.550
- VIP access.
- Oh.

43:01.180 --> 43:02.680
We're famous.

43:19.650 --> 43:20.740
You're late, major.

43:20.820 --> 43:23.740
Sorry, sir. Things got a bit
more complicated than we expected.

43:24.020 --> 43:26.040
Prepare for the worst
and you won't be disappointed.

43:26.080 --> 43:27.080
And neither will I.

43:28.290 --> 43:30.580
I'll keep that in mind, sir.

43:32.670 --> 43:34.840
And you, have you checked the converter?

43:34.920 --> 43:36.130
He's in great shape.

43:36.210 --> 43:37.380
May I ask what's going on?

43:38.670 --> 43:39.590
Follow me.

43:44.140 --> 43:45.470
Declassify.

43:48.220 --> 43:50.890
A year ago, we discovered
a radioactive zone

43:50.980 --> 43:52.520
right in the middle of the station.

43:53.600 --> 43:55.310
No signal of any kind
could get through it.

43:55.400 --> 43:57.610
We sent several probes, none came back.

43:58.480 --> 44:00.070
So we sent in a special unit.

44:00.400 --> 44:02.780
"Its mission was to get as close
to the zone as possible,"

44:03.240 --> 44:05.030
and define the nature of the threat.

44:05.530 --> 44:07.410
And?

44:07.490 --> 44:08.620
No one came back alive.

44:09.950 --> 44:11.830
- Any idea who attacked them?
- No.

44:13.170 --> 44:14.540
This is the situation today.

44:16.920 --> 44:20.260
The air in the zone is unbreathable,
highly contaminated.

44:21.470 --> 44:24.220
And it continues to grow. Like a tumor.

44:24.300 --> 44:26.720
A tumor we have to cut out
as soon as we can.

44:26.800 --> 44:28.680
If we don't, and this cancer
keeps spreading,

44:28.760 --> 44:30.560
it will destroy Alpha in less than a week.

44:31.350 --> 44:33.440
Commander, who would have
any reason to destroy Alpha?

44:33.520 --> 44:35.560
Practically every living
species is represented here.

44:35.650 --> 44:38.770
This is a weapon of mass destruction, and
behind every weapon, there is a killer.

44:38.860 --> 44:42.450
It doesn't matter who it is. It's a threat
to us all. It must be eliminated.

44:42.530 --> 44:43.450
Through here.

44:51.330 --> 44:52.460
"- Commander."
- Minister.

44:52.540 --> 44:54.250
"The council has given you
the green light."

44:54.750 --> 44:57.330
"But we strongly recommend
that international law"

44:57.600 --> 44:59.870
"and the civil rights of all concerned
should be respected."

44:59.880 --> 45:01.590
Of course. I shall see to it personally.

45:01.670 --> 45:03.840
"Agents Valerian and Laureline
will be responsible"

45:03.920 --> 45:05.120
"for your personal protection."

45:05.180 --> 45:06.970
Sir, that won't be necessary.

45:07.390 --> 45:09.600
I have a unit of K-Tron
that I personally trained...

45:09.680 --> 45:11.890
"It's a direct order from the government,
commander."

45:12.270 --> 45:15.270
"The two agents need to report
on the outcome of the operations."

45:18.110 --> 45:19.020
As you wish.

45:19.570 --> 45:22.440
"Gentlemen, lady, good luck."

45:26.340 --> 45:27.790
Since we have to be on the same team,

45:27.820 --> 45:29.870
you mind giving us an update
on the operation?

45:29.950 --> 45:33.200
I'll be speaking to the security council
in a few minutes.

45:33.660 --> 45:35.830
You'll have all the details
you need to know.

45:38.170 --> 45:39.840
This is gonna be a lot of fun.

45:49.720 --> 45:52.970
Hey, handsome. You're looking a lot better.

45:54.020 --> 45:56.560
You know, I remember learning
about you guys at school.

45:57.900 --> 46:00.310
I'm dying to find out if what
they say is true.

46:01.650 --> 46:02.570
Okay.

46:09.160 --> 46:10.070
Wow.

46:11.370 --> 46:13.080
I need to take you shopping with me.

46:22.380 --> 46:23.920
Wait for me here.

46:40.060 --> 46:41.360
- Anything?
- Not yet.

46:41.940 --> 46:45.030
We haven't got a peep out of him,
but I'm trying something new.

46:50.320 --> 46:51.370
One more hour.

46:53.280 --> 46:55.240
If he hasn't talked, finish him off.

46:55.660 --> 46:56.580
Yes, sir.

47:06.960 --> 47:09.090
If anything goes wrong with this operation,

47:11.430 --> 47:13.970
you know what you have to do.

47:29.700 --> 47:31.820
Wow.

47:32.910 --> 47:35.410
Looks like you're taking my protection
very seriously.

47:35.490 --> 47:37.620
His protection, actually.
He's one of a kind.

47:37.630 --> 47:40.030
You're sure he needs to come along
on such a dangerous mission?

47:40.040 --> 47:41.760
The Mül converter is capable
of reproducing

47:41.770 --> 47:44.520
any conceivable product in record time.

47:44.740 --> 47:46.760
It will come in very handy
if we have to negotiate.

47:46.770 --> 47:48.520
With the army of K-Trons
under your command,

47:48.530 --> 47:50.190
I'm surprised negotiating's on the table.

47:51.340 --> 47:53.140
You take care of my security, major.

47:54.260 --> 47:55.930
I'll take care of any negotiations.

47:55.950 --> 47:58.160
- Give it to me.
- I don't think that's a very good idea.

47:58.170 --> 48:00.530
For your personal security,
why don't you let agent Laureline

48:00.600 --> 48:02.230
look after the little guy for safekeeping?

48:02.310 --> 48:05.020
I don't think so, major.
It's against protocol.

48:05.050 --> 48:07.170
I am the highest ranking...

48:07.170 --> 48:09.340
That animal is the last living specimen
of its species.

48:09.350 --> 48:10.600
The whole universe is after it.

48:10.610 --> 48:12.860
That's why major Valerian
would rather I held onto it.

48:15.410 --> 48:16.410
All right.

48:18.620 --> 48:19.620
Just don't leave my side.

48:26.500 --> 48:28.210
Commander, the council is waiting.

48:30.170 --> 48:33.220
Okay, let's do this.

48:37.930 --> 48:38.850
Stay here.

48:44.140 --> 48:45.230
"En route to the meeting."

48:45.690 --> 48:46.610
Received, general.

48:54.740 --> 48:57.070
You stay on backup.
I'll take the front line.

48:59.490 --> 49:00.540
Yes, sir.

49:08.750 --> 49:11.210
Delegates, thank you
for answering the call so quickly.

49:12.590 --> 49:14.930
As the elected representative
of the human federation,

49:15.010 --> 49:17.180
I have called this meeting
of the Alpha security council

49:17.260 --> 49:19.330
to update you regarding
the state of emergency

49:19.360 --> 49:20.510
we find ourselves in.

49:21.310 --> 49:22.350
As you all know,

49:22.850 --> 49:26.520
the heart of historic Alpha station
has been contaminated by a force

49:26.600 --> 49:28.810
whose power we do not know the origins of.

49:29.820 --> 49:32.860
The human federation has launched
several small military attacks

49:32.940 --> 49:35.150
in order to ascertain
the severity of the threat,

49:36.160 --> 49:37.820
but these have all ended in failure.

49:38.570 --> 49:40.910
And with some significant
losses among our troops.

49:40.990 --> 49:43.790
In light of this alarming
and growing threat to us all,

49:43.870 --> 49:45.290
the human federation is seeking...

49:45.370 --> 49:46.460
Everything okay?

49:47.580 --> 49:49.920
You're missing out.
I'm having a lot of fun.

49:50.590 --> 49:52.800
Yeah. Don't worry,
we'll be on the beach soon.

49:53.530 --> 49:55.250
I can now answer any questions you may have

49:55.300 --> 49:56.930
about the details of the operation.

50:02.600 --> 50:04.850
13th battalion, special assaults division.

50:05.430 --> 50:07.900
- There she is.
- I told you she was there.

50:07.980 --> 50:09.190
That's all I need.

50:09.270 --> 50:10.560
Agent Laureline.

50:10.650 --> 50:12.190
- What?
- Doghan Daguis.

50:12.270 --> 50:13.190
Oh.

50:13.690 --> 50:15.740
- Nice to see you again.
- Agent Laureline.

50:15.780 --> 50:16.760
As resplendent as ever.

50:16.760 --> 50:18.130
Just tell me what you want.

50:18.200 --> 50:19.280
We go where work calls.

50:19.370 --> 50:20.700
We speak over 5,000 languages.

50:20.780 --> 50:22.490
Which can be handy in a party like this.

50:22.580 --> 50:23.950
Need our services?

50:24.040 --> 50:27.660
I have my own personal translator.
Now move.

50:28.210 --> 50:29.670
Ask them if they have intel on Mül.

50:32.000 --> 50:33.800
Planet Mül, ring any bells?

50:33.880 --> 50:35.260
A highly sensitive matter.

50:35.340 --> 50:36.510
The best person to speak to...

50:36.590 --> 50:37.720
Would be major Samk.

50:38.050 --> 50:38.970
Alex?

50:40.090 --> 50:41.390
Major Samk died a year ago.

50:41.470 --> 50:43.470
Well, yes, a most curious demise.

50:43.560 --> 50:46.600
- That was not fully explained.
- Murder some might call it.

50:46.680 --> 50:49.730
Major Samk was an expert on planet Mül.

50:49.810 --> 50:51.440
He took all that precious information...

50:51.520 --> 50:52.610
To the grave with him.

50:52.690 --> 50:53.520
What a waste.

50:53.610 --> 50:55.570
If you receive any intel on this planet,

50:55.590 --> 50:57.300
- we're interested.
- It would be a pleasure

50:57.310 --> 50:59.210
- to work for you, Laureline.
- Before we go...

50:59.280 --> 51:00.950
- We would like to give you...
- Some info.

51:01.030 --> 51:01.950
For free.

51:02.320 --> 51:03.450
- For free?
- Mmm-hmm.

51:03.530 --> 51:04.990
You guys must be sick.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.120
- The converter is precious.
- And highly sought-after.

51:07.130 --> 51:08.880
- Mercenaries will come...
- To retrieve it...

51:08.890 --> 51:10.910
- Sooner than you think.
- What kind of mercenaries?

51:10.920 --> 51:12.880
- The first tip was free.
- You must pay for more.

51:12.890 --> 51:14.470
But you get a discount, of course.

51:18.420 --> 51:20.510
General, we have an alert on section b.

51:20.590 --> 51:23.470
- Alex, what's that?
"- A dozen individuals approaching."

51:23.550 --> 51:26.180
- What kind of individuals?
"- Undetectable for now."

51:26.270 --> 51:28.480
It appears your info just lost its value.

51:29.270 --> 51:30.350
Now get out of my face.

51:31.940 --> 51:33.810
- Move, pigeons.
- She just called us pigeons.

51:33.900 --> 51:35.170
- What's a pigeon?
- I don't know.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.700
- Where are they coming from?
"- Everywhere."

51:39.860 --> 51:41.210
"They're going through the walls."

51:41.240 --> 51:43.070
Alex, I need to know
the attackers' identity.

51:43.160 --> 51:44.990
Everyone, please evacuate.

51:45.700 --> 51:47.200
"I cannot read their DNA."

51:47.580 --> 51:48.500
What?

51:51.420 --> 51:54.000
Sir, the door's locked. We can't get out.

51:54.460 --> 51:55.750
- Laureline.
- I'm coming.

51:59.630 --> 52:01.300
- Evacuate the commander.
- Copy that.

52:02.010 --> 52:03.550
General, secure that door.

52:04.090 --> 52:05.260
- Commander.
- What's going on?

52:05.350 --> 52:07.060
- We need to evacuate.
- Let's go.

52:10.310 --> 52:13.020
- It's not working.
- What? Alex, open the door.

54:09.600 --> 54:10.930
- What was that?
- The pearls.

54:11.350 --> 54:14.470
They took the commander.
Here, take this. Free the general.

54:14.560 --> 54:16.410
Go to the command room
and track them from there.

54:16.480 --> 54:17.310
Okay.

54:30.530 --> 54:32.420
- Are we back to full power?
- Yes, sir, just now.

54:32.490 --> 54:33.910
Everybody, back to your posts!

54:39.580 --> 54:42.040
Status on major Valerian?
Level 5 emergency.

54:42.130 --> 54:43.050
Confirmed.

54:44.840 --> 54:46.420
Valerian, I've got you on visual.

54:46.425 --> 54:47.825
"Okay, but I've lost track of them."

54:47.830 --> 54:49.080
"Try to locate the commander."

54:55.930 --> 54:58.190
Okay, I've got him.
He's near the docking bay,

54:58.270 --> 54:59.810
so he must be headed towards the vessel.

55:01.730 --> 55:04.400
Okay, what's the shortest way there?

55:04.900 --> 55:07.150
North-northeast, 113 degrees.

55:07.240 --> 55:11.620
Sixty, 70, 80, 90.

55:13.240 --> 55:16.010
That leads me straight into a wall.
You said you wanted the shortest way.

55:57.910 --> 56:00.500
It may be the shortest way,
but it's not the easiest.

56:09.090 --> 56:11.590
Keep going. You're almost there.

56:24.270 --> 56:26.610
They've reached another ship.
No tags, unknown model.

56:27.070 --> 56:30.070
Valerian, they've boarded. Change of plan.
A hundred and forty degrees east.

56:30.150 --> 56:31.240
Alex will pick you up.

56:36.490 --> 56:38.790
"- 81?"
- That's it. 81, straight.

56:39.950 --> 56:41.620
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

56:41.710 --> 56:44.000
- 81? You're sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

56:44.080 --> 56:46.500
Because I just went through
and I'm falling in space.

56:50.550 --> 56:52.420
Sorry, my mistake. It was number 18.

56:52.510 --> 56:54.970
That's okay. We all make mistakes.

56:55.050 --> 56:56.760
Any idea to get me out of here?

56:56.850 --> 56:58.470
Alex, pick him up on 81.

57:11.650 --> 57:12.690
I'm in. Close it.

57:22.250 --> 57:23.710
Bring on the beach.

57:33.050 --> 57:36.590
I'm not sure where you come from,
but I know where I'm gonna send you.

57:52.570 --> 57:55.740
"Valerian, hold still.
We're analyzing its system of defense."

58:00.530 --> 58:01.910
Major, their protective shield

58:01.920 --> 58:03.670
is too sophisticated.
You won't get through.

58:03.670 --> 58:05.170
I'm gonna try something bigger.

58:10.420 --> 58:11.340
Shit!

58:16.170 --> 58:17.980
Laureline, which one
has the commander on board?

58:18.260 --> 58:20.390
"Nine o'clock, lower level. Hurry up."

58:22.720 --> 58:24.140
"That's the one. Don't lose it."

58:36.740 --> 58:37.860
Valerian, be careful.

58:56.050 --> 58:58.720
The lntruder's too big to follow them.
I'm gonna take the skyjet.

58:59.720 --> 59:00.640
Okay.

59:17.240 --> 59:19.240
Okay, Valerian, you're near the dead zone.

59:19.780 --> 59:21.410
Reel them in before I lose you.

59:21.490 --> 59:22.740
I'm working on it.

59:39.800 --> 59:41.510
"Valerian, you need to go faster."

59:50.310 --> 59:52.650
Valerian, you've got 10 seconds
before I lose you.

59:52.730 --> 59:53.810
Take that.

59:57.860 --> 59:59.030
Who's the clever one now?

59:59.110 --> 01:00:01.240
Valerian, you've got five seconds.

01:00:04.530 --> 01:00:06.410
Oh, no. Not me.

01:00:10.410 --> 01:00:12.540
- Valerian?
- I can't slow 'em down.

01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:15.380
Come on. Come on.

01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:17.630
"Entering red zone."

01:00:17.710 --> 01:00:19.210
"Entering red zone."

01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:20.590
Valerian, do you hear me?

01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:24.720
Laureline! I'm losing control!

01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:26.260
Laureline!

01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:31.600
Valerian, answer me. Valerian, answer me.

01:00:31.690 --> 01:00:34.020
- Major, respond.
- Alex, can you help?

01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:35.530
"There's too much interference."

01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:37.270
"I've lost the major's signal."

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:44.030
Valerian? Valerian?

01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:48.160
Valerian, do you copy?

01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:50.500
We've lost him.

01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:51.840
Sergeant, where are you going?

01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:53.080
To grab my skyjet.

01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:56.080
- You won't be going after him.
- Why not?

01:00:56.170 --> 01:00:58.250
That zone is under enemy control.
It's too dangerous.

01:00:58.340 --> 01:00:59.550
An enemy that we don't know!

01:00:59.630 --> 01:01:01.210
An enemy that's just attacked us!

01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:03.490
By putting us to sleep
and not hurting a single one of us!

01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:05.800
Why would they spare our lives?
Give me one good reason.

01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:07.930
I don't know.

01:01:08.010 --> 01:01:11.100
Valerian has seen these creatures before.
They are from planet Mül.

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:13.770
Planet Mül was destroyed 30 years ago.

01:01:14.310 --> 01:01:15.400
You're not making any sense.

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:17.310
It's our mission that doesn't make sense,
sir!

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:18.480
Someone is lying to us,

01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:21.570
and while you find out who,
I'm going to go save my partner.

01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:33.540
General, major Valerian
is an invaluable agent.

01:01:34.210 --> 01:01:35.540
You cannot afford to lose him.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.170
No, I can't afford to lose both of you
in one day.

01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:40.250
Restrain her.

01:01:45.930 --> 01:01:46.970
Put us on high alert,

01:01:48.010 --> 01:01:49.470
and find me the commander.

01:01:49.930 --> 01:01:50.850
Yes, sir.

01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:12.540
Listen, I don't wanna tell you guys
how to do your jobs,

01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:14.290
but don't you think you should cuff me?

01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:16.540
Firstly, because it's protocol,
but secondly,

01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:18.790
because I'm very tempted to escape.

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:35.680
Good job, boys.

01:02:40.770 --> 01:02:43.110
We need to talk.

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:45.650
Oh, it's dark in here.

01:02:48.990 --> 01:02:49.990
- Ow!
- Sorry.

01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:53.120
If you don't help me find Valerian,
then this bullet's gonna find you.

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.290
- You're up first.
- No, no, no, no.

01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:57.900
- It's to avoid such situations...
- That all of our information...

01:02:57.910 --> 01:02:59.960
- Is divided three ways.
- Kill one of us...

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:02.310
- And you kill the information.
- What a pity that would be.

01:03:02.790 --> 01:03:04.770
Okay. You're gonna have to give me credit,
though,

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:06.860
- 'cause I don't have much on me.
- Oh, how tiresome.

01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:09.640
- If the commander were here...
- He could use the converter to pay us.

01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:10.650
But he's been abducted...

01:03:10.650 --> 01:03:12.430
Precisely because he had the converter
on him.

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:13.670
Unless, for security reasons...

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:15.350
Someone else was carrying it on them.

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:18.270
How in space did you get that info?

01:03:18.690 --> 01:03:19.980
- It's not info.
- Just deduction.

01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:23.360
- We know how humans work.
- They're all so predictable.

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:25.690
Clearly you've never met a woman.

01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:27.320
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Calm down.

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:28.610
What do you want to know?

01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:30.200
Valerian's exact location.

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:31.450
Hard to tell.

01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:32.930
But we know how to track him down...

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:33.940
With complete precision.

01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:36.330
- How much?
- One hundred baduls.

01:03:36.410 --> 01:03:38.160
- Each.
- Forget about it.

01:03:39.290 --> 01:03:40.210
This is all I have.

01:03:42.330 --> 01:03:44.000
Diamonds are less valuable than baduls.

01:03:44.090 --> 01:03:45.130
The negotiation is over.

01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:47.130
- We trust you.
- And under the circumstances...

01:03:47.210 --> 01:03:48.840
- We accept the deal.
- Good.

01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:51.180
Now take me to Valerian. Now.

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:52.390
Follow us.

01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:53.970
Philips, head to the location

01:03:54.050 --> 01:03:55.260
where the major disappeared.

01:03:55.350 --> 01:03:57.770
Milo, track down agent Laureline
and bring her in.

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.770
- Neza, inform the minister.
- Yes, sir.

01:04:01.810 --> 01:04:03.230
Just give me a few minutes, please.

01:04:07.690 --> 01:04:08.610
Declassify.

01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:11.910
I need all information on the planet Mül.

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:16.870
Well, who has authority over this file?

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:28.630
Here we are.

01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:30.340
I do not like this place.

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:34.640
Here.

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:43.560
I've got a bad feeling
about this idea of yours.

01:04:50.610 --> 01:04:51.530
Bingo.

01:04:55.450 --> 01:04:57.660
What do you want?

01:04:57.740 --> 01:04:59.790
- We'd like to go fishing...
- For a cortex jellyfish.

01:04:59.870 --> 01:05:01.120
Male, if possible.

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:06.130
Nah, it's not the season.

01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:07.670
Here.

01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:12.510
- Males are harder to catch.
- And here.

01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:16.590
Welcome aboard.

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:24.140
Uh...

01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:25.310
The thing, down.

01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:28.400
- The... down. The thing, down.
- This one?

01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:43.040
There. Bromosaurs.

01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:51.210
- Are they dangerous?
- Not really.

01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:53.260
You just have to be careful
they don't inhale you.

01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:08.230
There, that one is a male.

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:15.360
How can you tell?

01:06:15.450 --> 01:06:18.070
Oh, they're much smaller than the females.

01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:32.920
How do you know that that one
has a jellyfish on it?

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:33.920
All males do.

01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:36.220
The bromosaurs blow out pure water,

01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:38.720
"which the jellyfish can't do without."

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:40.850
That's why they live on them
all year round,

01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:44.060
and that's where they get
their hypersensitivity from.

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:54.400
Soft as silk.

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:55.740
Can I help? I'm a good driver.

01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:17.110
- Seat belt.
- What?

01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:32.730
Seat belt.

01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:34.390
I thought you said
they weren't aggressive.

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:35.940
Except when you take their little buddy.

01:07:36.690 --> 01:07:38.210
Great.

01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:10.730
I'm Bob, by the way.

01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:13.660
Hi.

01:08:18.029 --> 01:08:19.189
There's no time to lose.

01:08:19.279 --> 01:08:21.450
The cortex jellyfish is extremely fragile.

01:08:21.899 --> 01:08:23.200
Show it images of Valerian...

01:08:23.279 --> 01:08:24.779
And it will show you what it has seen.

01:08:25.450 --> 01:08:26.740
Sure, but how?

01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:28.319
- You have to put it...
- On your head...

01:08:28.330 --> 01:08:29.370
Down to your shoulders.

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:31.279
- You're kidding?
- Never when we're working.

01:08:31.279 --> 01:08:33.740
- Through a kind of osmosis...
- You'll be able to communicate.

01:08:33.750 --> 01:08:35.750
- But be very careful...
- Not to stay under there...

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:36.830
Longer than a minute.

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:38.229
Because then it starts to feed...

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:39.279
On your memory.

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:43.180
Great. Anything else I should know before

01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:45.180
I voluntarily stick my head on his mouth?

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:47.010
Actually, it's not his mouth.

01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:48.180
- You can begin.
- Good luck.

01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:54.649
- Don't forget.
- One minute.

01:08:54.729 --> 01:08:55.649
Not a second more.

01:08:58.270 --> 01:09:01.240
I knew I had it in here somewhere.
There we are. Aah!

01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:09.370
There we go.

01:09:10.830 --> 01:09:12.040
This is so exciting.

01:09:14.330 --> 01:09:15.250
"Valerian?"

01:09:20.130 --> 01:09:21.300
"I only work with my partner."

01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:23.510
"Valerian, answer me!"

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:28.149
"What can I do to make it up to you?"

01:09:34.689 --> 01:09:35.689
Thirty seconds.

01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:37.189
"Valerian, answer me!"

01:09:37.939 --> 01:09:38.859
"Take that."

01:09:43.529 --> 01:09:45.609
"Laureline! I'm losing control!"

01:09:47.279 --> 01:09:48.200
"Valerian!"

01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:52.790
"- Valerian!
- Laureline!"

01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:53.960
Forty seconds.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:56.920
"Valerian!"

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:05.720
- Fifty seconds! Get out!
- Now!

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:07.090
Fifty-five seconds!

01:10:08.430 --> 01:10:09.680
"Valerian!"

01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:12.060
"Valerian."

01:10:15.310 --> 01:10:16.390
"Valerian!"

01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:21.020
- Beautiful.
- Incredible.

01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:23.360
- One minute...
- And 10 seconds.

01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:24.360
A record.

01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:29.530
Okay...

01:10:30.490 --> 01:10:37.370
«L. 630. E-s-u-l deactivated.»

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:39.330
Any idea what that means, guys?

01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:41.840
- Level 630 east.
- Most likely a sulfate pipe.

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.460
Deactivated, apparently.

01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:45.970
Okay. Okay, thanks.

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:48.300
You need a detailed map?

01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:52.350
We biologically traced
sergeant Laureline to here.

01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:54.020
What's she doing out by the Galana sea?

01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:57.270
No idea, sir. She stole a vehicle.

01:10:57.350 --> 01:11:00.100
She headed into the red zone,
and we lost track of her.

01:11:02.150 --> 01:11:03.770
She must have located the major.

01:11:04.190 --> 01:11:06.070
"General, there are three civilians here"

01:11:06.150 --> 01:11:08.275
"who claim to have information
that might interest you."

01:11:08.650 --> 01:11:09.570
Show them in.

01:11:11.370 --> 01:11:12.660
Ah...

01:11:14.330 --> 01:11:15.240
It's you three.

01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:19.080
- Our humble respects, general.
- May you be healthy...

01:11:19.170 --> 01:11:20.830
- And prosperous.
- What do you want?

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:22.570
We have information
of the utmost importance.

01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:24.630
- That we're ready to sell.
- 100 baduls.

01:11:25.090 --> 01:11:28.010
- Each.
- Shoot.

01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:40.980
Valerian!

01:11:50.450 --> 01:11:51.450
Move, lizard.

01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:05.130
Valerian? Valerian, do you hear me?

01:12:10.050 --> 01:12:12.590
Valerian, wake up. Valerian, please.

01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:15.550
Stay with me, Valerian. Come on. Come on.

01:12:27.940 --> 01:12:30.280
- What are you doing here?
- I came to get you.

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:31.900
You totaled your skyjet, remember?

01:12:33.410 --> 01:12:36.870
Yeah. I lost it in a curve.

01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:39.580
You mean you almost died.
You're lucky I found you.

01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:41.520
What about the commander?
Do we know where he is?

01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:42.500
There's no sign of him.

01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:44.300
Their spaceship went into a red zone.

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:46.790
We gotta find him.

01:12:47.670 --> 01:12:49.380
- Let's go.
- Wait.

01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:55.010
- Is that all?
- What do you mean?

01:12:55.090 --> 01:12:57.140
No «thank you»? No «well done»?

01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:59.750
I would have done the same for you.

01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:08.480
- You little prick.
- Whoa! Hey, hey, hey, chill.

01:13:09.190 --> 01:13:10.860
I trusted you more than I trusted myself.

01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:12.280
- Isn't that what you wanted?
- No.

01:13:13.530 --> 01:13:15.410
You are an amazing woman, Laureline.

01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:17.380
It's no wonder I wanna marry you.

01:13:17.410 --> 01:13:20.200
Why would I wanna marry
an ungrateful, conceited...

01:13:20.290 --> 01:13:21.730
Because you can't live without him.

01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:24.770
I mean, look, whenever he wanders off,
you go chasing after him.

01:13:27.330 --> 01:13:29.420
I was just doing my job, major.

01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:32.210
Now will you please let me
get back to the mission?

01:13:32.590 --> 01:13:34.430
Yeah, sure.

01:13:35.010 --> 01:13:35.840
Good.

01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:36.840
Sergeant.

01:13:43.650 --> 01:13:44.860
Captain, what's going on here?

01:13:44.890 --> 01:13:47.520
I report directly
to the commander Arun Filitt.

01:13:47.610 --> 01:13:49.400
- I don't have to...
- I am general Okto-bar!

01:13:49.570 --> 01:13:52.070
In the absence of the commander,
I am in command on Alpha!

01:13:52.820 --> 01:13:53.740
Arrest this man!

01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:55.910
And release that one.

01:14:00.910 --> 01:14:02.660
I apologize for your mistreatment.

01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:06.290
We will take you to a jail
but our doctors will take care of you.

01:14:10.250 --> 01:14:11.210
Help us.

01:14:13.050 --> 01:14:14.010
If you need my help,

01:14:15.010 --> 01:14:16.550
you have to tell me everything you know.

01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:20.170
But first of all,
why are you attacking us?

01:14:20.850 --> 01:14:25.310
Because you have... What we need.

01:14:39.170 --> 01:14:40.830
Didn't you say that the girl in your dream

01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:43.580
- had a converter just like mine?
- That's right.

01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:45.550
So if the animals are native
on their planet then,

01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:48.790
surely it's understandable that they want
to retrieve the last living specimen.

01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:50.750
Yeah, and they probably
kidnapped the commander

01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:52.340
because they thought he was carrying it.

01:14:52.350 --> 01:14:53.700
Yeah, once they find out he's not,

01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:55.050
then I'll be the top of their list.

01:14:55.380 --> 01:14:57.170
Don't worry, I'm not letting
you go anywhere.

01:14:57.380 --> 01:14:59.260
No, I'm not letting you go anywhere.

01:15:02.890 --> 01:15:04.220
Wow.

01:15:17.490 --> 01:15:18.450
Pretty butterfly.

01:15:18.530 --> 01:15:20.410
Sure, but whatever you do,
don't touch them.

01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:22.950
- Why?
- Because some of them are...

01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:25.200
No!

01:15:26.370 --> 01:15:27.290
Valerian!

01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:29.670
Laureline!

01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:33.920
I'm coming! I'm coming. I'm coming.

01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:00.700
Let me go, fatty. Come on, put me down.

01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:02.450
[Quiet.]

01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:05.240
Sorry, I'm inedible.

01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:08.620
Valerian!

01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:17.170
"Major, I can read your signal now."

01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:18.430
Valerian!

01:16:18.450 --> 01:16:19.750
[Quiet!]

01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:33.310
Alex, any ideas?

01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:35.810
"The only way to get in without creating"

01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:38.980
"a severe diplomatic incident
is to pass for one of them."

01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:41.700
"I suggest you try to find a glamopod."

01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:45.320
Thanks, Alex.

01:16:55.710 --> 01:16:56.960
Have you run a DNA search?

01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:01.470
Yes, but it didn't match
any of the 800 million species

01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:03.670
- we have in that database.
- Well, how's that possible?

01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:06.050
Either it belongs to
a completely unknown species...

01:17:06.510 --> 01:17:07.350
Ur?

01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:09.890
Or this species was deliberately deleted
from the database.

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:15.690
General, the major has resurfaced

01:17:15.770 --> 01:17:16.850
at the edge of the red zone.

01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:18.320
Which district is he in?

01:17:18.820 --> 01:17:19.730
Paradise alley.

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:23.280
Notify all units.

01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:29.450
"All units. Search alert. Major Valerian."

01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:32.540
"Not dangerous. Find and assist."

01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:37.330
- Can I help you?
- Sure you can. Move.

01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:43.340
Good. Now slide your gun into my holster.

01:17:45.630 --> 01:17:46.680
Hold still.

01:18:08.910 --> 01:18:09.910
Hi, sugar.

01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:12.620
Do you wanna ride?

01:18:16.870 --> 01:18:18.540
Hey!

01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:21.380
Hey, you wanna fly?

01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:23.630
I'm allergic to feathers.

01:18:25.010 --> 01:18:26.130
My hero.

01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:27.840
You got the wrong guy.

01:18:35.810 --> 01:18:36.980
Huh. I...

01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:38.020
I don't speak French.

01:18:42.230 --> 01:18:43.320
Hello.

01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:48.820
Come on, out. Pervert.

01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:52.200
Hey, cowboy. You've come to the right spot.

01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:54.370
It's the best damn club
on the whole space station.

01:18:54.450 --> 01:18:56.410
- Hey, jolly.
- I'll be with you in a second.

01:18:57.750 --> 01:18:59.540
I'm looking for something special.

01:18:59.630 --> 01:19:02.130
Well, of course you are.
Whatever it is you want,

01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:04.590
I got it.

01:19:04.670 --> 01:19:06.340
- I'm not so sure about...
- Well, I am.

01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:08.490
Tell me, what is it you want?
What are you looking for?

01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:10.750
- A glamopod.
- You are so lucky.

01:19:10.890 --> 01:19:13.180
I got the best one in the whole universe.
Come on!

01:19:14.770 --> 01:19:15.770
Jolly.

01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:18.350
Come on.

01:19:29.950 --> 01:19:32.240
Hey, I work for the government.

01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:39.750
If you want to avoid a diplomatic incident
you better let me go right now.

01:19:44.170 --> 01:19:47.170
Look, listen. I didn't come here
to get a makeover.

01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:49.680
I need to leave. Do you understand?

01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:56.520
I can't believe it.

01:19:57.180 --> 01:19:59.520
I'm not here to try on a stupid dress!

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:00.940
Call your chief or a translator

01:20:01.020 --> 01:20:02.350
so we can at least communicate.

01:20:04.230 --> 01:20:07.230
Do you understand what I am saying?

01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:17.830
Hmm.

01:20:19.790 --> 01:20:20.710
Okay.

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:28.960
This is where you lose
the hardware, soldier boy.

01:20:29.050 --> 01:20:30.800
I'd rather hold onto it. I'm on duty.

01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:33.050
Yeah, well, unfortunately rules are rules,

01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:35.680
and this is a place where we make love,
not war.

01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:40.100
Here's your ticket.

01:20:41.730 --> 01:20:43.520
Don't lose it.

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:44.560
Can we make a deal?

01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:48.030
Let's not talk about business, can we?

01:20:48.730 --> 01:20:49.650
Let's talk pleasure.

01:20:50.150 --> 01:20:51.820
What kinda music are you into, huh?

01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:54.700
You like techno? Macro? Bio? Nano?

01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:56.490
- I'm more retro.
- Oh. Me, too.

01:20:56.580 --> 01:20:57.580
Oldies are goodies.

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:03.750
Sit down. Relax. And enjoy the show.

01:23:30.690 --> 01:23:32.520
Ha!

01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:39.610
I don't know how long
I can keep doing this.

01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:50.080
So what'll it be, soldier?

01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:52.920
Look, that was really cool,

01:23:52.930 --> 01:23:54.790
but not exactly what I'm looking for
right now.

01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:57.930
Well I have a whole lot more in stock
if you just tell me what you have in mind.

01:23:57.930 --> 01:23:58.930
I have a lot in mind.

01:23:59.470 --> 01:24:01.220
And no time for this. I'll pass.

01:24:02.590 --> 01:24:04.720
Listen, I have a problem
and I really need your help.

01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:06.160
You didn't like my performance?

01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:07.310
No, no, yeah. I...

01:24:08.930 --> 01:24:12.440
- I loved it. Absolutely.
- I started at age four.

01:24:13.310 --> 01:24:15.190
Learning my trade in all the top schools.

01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:18.860
- I can play anyone or anything.
- I'm sure you can.

01:24:18.940 --> 01:24:20.780
I know all of Shakespeare by heart
if you want.

01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:22.360
Poetry maybe? You like poetry?

01:24:22.450 --> 01:24:25.240
- Sure.
- Rimbaud? Verlaine?

01:24:25.330 --> 01:24:26.580
Tough choice.

01:24:32.170 --> 01:24:33.290
«I'm afraid of a kiss...»

01:24:37.050 --> 01:24:38.300
Like the kiss of a bee...

01:24:39.970 --> 01:24:41.260
I suffer like this...

01:24:42.970 --> 01:24:44.220
And wake endlessly...

01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:48.060
«I'm afraid of a kiss.»

01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:56.900
How about I tell you
what I really have in mind?

01:24:59.190 --> 01:25:01.530
- No, quit screaming.
- How'd you get a gun?

01:25:02.530 --> 01:25:05.410
Hey...

01:25:05.490 --> 01:25:08.700
Major Valerian, I advise you
to put that gun down.

01:25:10.290 --> 01:25:14.210
- And I advise you to sit down.
- Okay, okay. Okay.

01:25:14.290 --> 01:25:17.000
- Please! No! Don't shoot me!
- What the hell is that?

01:25:17.090 --> 01:25:18.840
That is you, when you were 10.

01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:20.880
You're not going to
shoot yourself, are you?

01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:22.970
- Will you go back to normal, please?
- Okay, okay.

01:25:25.010 --> 01:25:27.430
No. Not this normal. The other one.

01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:28.470
Okay, okay.

01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:33.770
Thank you. What's your name?

01:25:33.850 --> 01:25:35.250
Whatever you want it to be, sweetie.

01:25:35.260 --> 01:25:38.230
I don't have time for your games, sweetie.
Come on, tell me, what's your name?

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:43.240
Bubble.

01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:46.240
Look, Bubble, I lost my partner.

01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:48.160
If you help me find her, I'll set you free.

01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:51.950
What good is freedom
when you're an illegal immigrant

01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:54.540
- far away from home?
- I work for the government.

01:25:54.620 --> 01:25:56.460
I'll get you an ID pass. You have my word.

01:25:59.210 --> 01:26:01.170
If I leave, Jolly will kill me.

01:26:01.250 --> 01:26:03.050
No, Jolly won't kill anybody ever again.

01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:11.220
So what do you say, Bubble?

01:26:12.850 --> 01:26:14.520
You really liked my performance?

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:16.690
Best I ever saw.

01:26:21.820 --> 01:26:22.730
Thank you.

01:26:23.190 --> 01:26:24.320
You're welcome.

01:26:30.990 --> 01:26:32.790
So, I'm gonna take 10.

01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:35.460
You two keep an eye on old soldier boy.

01:26:35.910 --> 01:26:37.960
He seems like a real freak to me.

01:26:42.670 --> 01:26:44.170
Okay, Bubble, get off me.

01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:45.890
All right, all right, I'm doing this.

01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:53.100
Hey, you good?

01:26:53.930 --> 01:26:54.850
Thanks.

01:26:59.810 --> 01:27:02.400
- You wanna go in there?
- Yeah, but no foreigners are allowed.

01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:04.140
The only way in is to look like
one of them.

01:27:04.530 --> 01:27:07.150
Oh, no, no, no! I've never played
a boulan bathor before.

01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:08.910
What? Are you an artist or not?

01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:14.290
Yes, but I need time to get into my role,
and capture my movements and behaviors,

01:27:14.370 --> 01:27:15.790
and character's arc.

01:27:15.870 --> 01:27:18.000
We do a couple rehearsals,
you give me some notes...

01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:20.540
Well, a little improve never hurt anyone.
Let's go.

01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:24.380
All right.

01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:26.670
Turn around.

01:27:34.010 --> 01:27:34.930
Ugh.

01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:36.520
This is not right.

01:27:37.730 --> 01:27:38.730
I need a manicure.

01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:49.450
Don't you think the hat
might be a little bit over the top?

01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:51.570
Uh... uh...

01:27:52.370 --> 01:27:53.280
Never mind.

01:27:56.290 --> 01:27:58.500
"Hey, hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?"

01:27:58.580 --> 01:28:00.420
Give me a second to get the hang of it.

01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:02.420
Hurry, people are staring at us.

01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:04.340
I told you I needed rehearsals.

01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:05.880
This is a heavy role.

01:28:07.010 --> 01:28:07.920
"Much better."

01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:09.260
"You're doing good."

01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:17.520
General, we've picked up
the major's trail again.

01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:19.810
Finally. Where is he?

01:28:20.690 --> 01:28:22.020
In boulan bathor territory.

01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:23.150
In the...

01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:26.230
Nobody gets in there.

01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:27.730
And definitely not out of there.

01:28:30.490 --> 01:28:32.260
We'll need reinforcements.
Inform the minister.

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:33.240
Yes, sir.

01:28:43.290 --> 01:28:45.090
So how did you come to lose your partner?

01:28:45.170 --> 01:28:46.840
"- Because I'm stupid."
- What do you mean?

01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:48.130
"All I do is flirt and joke."

01:28:48.660 --> 01:28:50.470
Oh, trying to be cool
rather than being honest?

01:28:50.510 --> 01:28:51.340
"Story of my life."

01:28:51.420 --> 01:28:53.340
How young were you when you lost your mom?

01:28:53.430 --> 01:28:54.760
"Please don't go there right now."

01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:56.610
It's okay to be vulnerable sometimes.

01:28:56.690 --> 01:28:58.780
"Can we stop this and get back
to the mission, please?"

01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:59.900
"And don't touch anything."

01:29:00.060 --> 01:29:01.980
Well, it wouldn't hurt you
to show some weakness.

01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:03.060
"I'm not good at that."

01:29:03.070 --> 01:29:05.170
It will make her feel important.

01:29:05.190 --> 01:29:07.850
"Yeah, believe me, she's already
the most important thing in my life."

01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:16.780
"I think he wants us to join the group."

01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:18.490
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:21.330
"It doesn't look like he's giving us
much choice."

01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:36.050
What's going on?

01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:38.890
I guess it's lunchtime
for emperor Boulan Ill.

01:29:50.610 --> 01:29:53.070
Bussing tables,
every artist's worst nightmare.

01:29:53.150 --> 01:29:54.820
Never mention this to anyone, okay?

01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:57.120
"Thank your lucky stars
we're not the main course."

01:30:02.950 --> 01:30:03.870
Oh...

01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:16.970
I'm going to be sick.

01:30:38.530 --> 01:30:39.780
"There she is."

01:30:39.870 --> 01:30:41.830
Wow. You're right, she's a 10.

01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:49.250
Hmm?

01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:11.900
Hi.

01:31:23.490 --> 01:31:25.700
"- Somethings wrong."
- How about I do a little dance,

01:31:25.790 --> 01:31:27.290
- to create a diversion?
"- No, thanks."

01:31:38.300 --> 01:31:40.930
- You guys are in big trouble!
- I think we should go.

01:31:41.010 --> 01:31:42.680
"I think you should let me handle this."

01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:47.600
- Valerian!
"- I'm in here!"

01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:11.880
Hey.

01:32:14.210 --> 01:32:15.880
You're gonna be a good boy, okay?

01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:17.760
Down! Stay!

01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:19.920
Laureline, it's me. Valerian.

01:32:20.010 --> 01:32:20.840
What?

01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:26.600
Oh!

01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:29.930
Bubble, get off me.

01:32:29.940 --> 01:32:31.090
Yes, you're right, let's go.

01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:32.020
Whoo!

01:32:33.350 --> 01:32:34.520
Excuse me, your highness.

01:32:43.030 --> 01:32:44.570
Hey, baby.

01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:53.000
I deserved that.

01:32:57.670 --> 01:32:58.590
Watch out!

01:32:59.670 --> 01:33:01.470
This is a lady. You can't fight her.

01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:13.850
Let's talk about this.
You're gonna hurt yourself.

01:33:16.150 --> 01:33:17.070
I warned you.

01:33:37.290 --> 01:33:38.750
Well, that's what I call a partner.

01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:40.760
Whoo-hoo!

01:33:41.630 --> 01:33:46.090
Bravo. That was amazing.
I'm very impressed.

01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:48.640
Hey.

01:33:49.930 --> 01:33:50.850
Hey.

01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:05.820
Trust me on this.

01:34:32.930 --> 01:34:34.480
"Third regiment approaching, sir."

01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:37.650
- Any news from our agents?
- None.

01:34:39.230 --> 01:34:40.820
And the commander? Any ransom demands?

01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:43.070
Negative. Minister on line.

01:34:43.150 --> 01:34:44.110
Okay.

01:34:47.610 --> 01:34:48.700
My respects, minister.

01:34:48.780 --> 01:34:50.990
"General, you've been authorized
by the council"

01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:52.830
"to assume command of this operation."

01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:54.410
"- Congratulations."
- Thank you, sir.

01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:58.460
But to fulfill my mission, I will need
full access to commander Filitt's data.

01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:03.590
"According to regulations, that is
impossible without his explicit agreement."

01:35:03.670 --> 01:35:05.090
The commander may well be dead.

01:35:06.220 --> 01:35:10.760
If I am to succeed in my new assignment,
I need to know everything.

01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:16.520
"- Access granted. "
- Thank you, sir.

01:35:22.650 --> 01:35:23.570
Declassify.

01:35:26.190 --> 01:35:27.820
Request file on the planet Mül.

01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:30.110
"Request authorized."

01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:34.240
Huh. «The conflict with
the Southern territories.»

01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:39.870
«The war against the Azien Korn
led to the destruction of planet Mül.»

01:35:40.540 --> 01:35:41.830
Tell me more about the planet.

01:35:42.710 --> 01:35:44.170
«The planet was uninhabited.»

01:35:46.460 --> 01:35:48.010
Who's in charge of this operation?

01:35:52.470 --> 01:35:53.810
This does not smell good.

01:36:13.410 --> 01:36:14.490
Told you there was a door.

01:36:14.580 --> 01:36:18.080
Someone didn't look over the plans
before they came rushing in. As usual.

01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:20.790
What, you'd rather I'd showed up
after the main event?

01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:24.290
I'd rather you took me someplace
other than a giant trash can.

01:36:25.250 --> 01:36:26.170
Bubble?

01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:32.010
Bubble, where are you? Where is she?

01:36:32.090 --> 01:36:33.020
She was right behind us.

01:36:33.470 --> 01:36:34.390
I'm here.

01:36:41.770 --> 01:36:42.690
What's wrong?

01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:44.960
I must've been injured during the fight.

01:36:44.980 --> 01:36:47.940
Bubble, tell me what to do.

01:36:49.860 --> 01:36:50.990
Nothing you can do.

01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:56.450
Anyway, where I'm from,
life is more painful than death.

01:36:56.530 --> 01:36:57.450
Don't say that.

01:36:58.870 --> 01:37:00.500
Unfortunately, it's true.

01:37:02.670 --> 01:37:05.790
Life's a drag when you don't have
an identity to call your own.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.170
You do have an identity.

01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:11.840
You're the greatest artist I've ever seen.

01:37:16.930 --> 01:37:17.930
I thank you.

01:37:24.650 --> 01:37:26.860
It was my pleasure performing for you.

01:37:28.610 --> 01:37:29.940
I leave you my kingdom.

01:37:32.030 --> 01:37:32.950
Take good care of it.

01:37:33.570 --> 01:37:34.490
I will.

01:37:34.990 --> 01:37:36.280
But most importantly...

01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:38.120
Yeah?

01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:39.910
Take good care of her.

01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:45.960
Love her without measure.

01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:50.670
«There's beggary in love
that can be reckoned.»

01:38:15.070 --> 01:38:15.990
Let's go.

01:38:33.920 --> 01:38:35.590
All the battleships have docked, general.

01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:38.300
Good. I want section 1
operative as soon as possible.

01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:39.890
What are those K-Tron doing there?

01:38:41.470 --> 01:38:43.050
The commander programmed them personally.

01:38:43.390 --> 01:38:45.770
- They can't be deactivated.
- Great.

01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:47.850
That's all we need.

01:38:54.990 --> 01:38:56.490
Do you have any idea where we're going?

01:38:56.530 --> 01:38:58.200
Yeah, sure. I mean...

01:39:00.780 --> 01:39:03.580
- I guess.
- You're sure or you guess?

01:39:03.660 --> 01:39:05.200
Look, I know it sounds strange but it...

01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:10.000
The Princess, she's guiding me.

01:39:10.580 --> 01:39:13.300
The Princess? She's guiding you?

01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:16.260
Yeah. Look, it's hard to explain,

01:39:16.340 --> 01:39:21.140
but it's like she's been
with me the whole time.

01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:22.720
Wait.

01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:26.640
You mean to tell me
that you've had a woman

01:39:27.230 --> 01:39:30.270
inside of you since the beginning?

01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:33.190
Laureline, can we just keep going, please?

01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:34.190
Sure.

01:39:35.650 --> 01:39:38.490
- Ladies first.
- Ha! Hilarious.

01:39:45.290 --> 01:39:46.410
"Go, fill it in! Fill it in!"

01:39:47.830 --> 01:39:48.750
"Over there!"

01:39:49.460 --> 01:39:51.670
Captain Kris. Section 1 operational.
General?

01:39:51.750 --> 01:39:54.590
Proceed. A unit of K-Trons will join you.

01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:58.720
- That won't be necessary.
- Commander's orders, not mine.

01:39:58.970 --> 01:40:01.430
Copy that. Move on!

01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:20.950
We've been manipulated from the start.

01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:22.570
What do you mean?

01:40:22.660 --> 01:40:25.140
We're in the middle of the dead zone
and we can breathe properly.

01:40:25.410 --> 01:40:27.580
It seems there's no sign of contamination.

01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:34.840
The commander's fully aware of what's
behind this so-called absolute evil.

01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:37.760
What?

01:40:44.180 --> 01:40:45.260
Pearls.

01:40:45.350 --> 01:40:48.520
My name is Tsfluri. I am the emperor's son.

01:40:48.530 --> 01:40:50.240
Great. How about you introduce us to daddy?

01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:51.940
He is expecting you.

01:40:55.110 --> 01:40:57.080
Try to contact the general.
Get everyone down here.

01:40:57.270 --> 01:40:58.190
I'll buy us some time.

01:40:58.980 --> 01:41:01.490
How about you run for backup for a change?

01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:08.200
Unbelievable.

01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:36.400
Follow me.

01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:20.440
I'd like you to meet my father,
the emperor.

01:42:31.580 --> 01:42:35.920
My name is Haban-Limat
and this is my wife, Aloi.

01:42:38.130 --> 01:42:39.790
We're pleased to welcome you here.

01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:43.460
My son sensed the presence of his sister,

01:42:43.550 --> 01:42:45.970
Princess Uhio-Minaa, in you.

01:42:50.430 --> 01:42:51.810
It seems she chose you.

01:42:53.770 --> 01:42:54.680
What do you mean?

01:42:58.190 --> 01:42:59.520
At the moment of passing,

01:42:59.610 --> 01:43:02.570
pearls release all the energy
left in their body

01:43:03.110 --> 01:43:04.490
in the form of a wave,

01:43:04.570 --> 01:43:07.240
which travels through space and time.

01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:09.450
Sometimes it finds a benevolent host.

01:43:09.530 --> 01:43:11.780
Lihö-Minaa chose you

01:43:12.450 --> 01:43:14.620
to be the guardian of her soul.

01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:18.830
Told you.

01:43:27.970 --> 01:43:29.090
My daughter.

01:43:34.470 --> 01:43:36.430
I'm so happy to see you.

01:43:37.180 --> 01:43:38.100
Same here.

01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:42.690
I mean, she is, too.

01:43:47.150 --> 01:43:50.280
What exactly happened to you
and your people?

01:43:51.410 --> 01:43:56.370
Our planet was a true paradise, on which
we lived in Harmony with the elements.

01:43:57.410 --> 01:44:02.170
"Our main activity was fishing for the
pearls who possessed phenomenal energy."

01:44:02.670 --> 01:44:06.380
"They fertilized our lands,
controlled the winds and tides."

01:44:07.210 --> 01:44:11.140
"Three times a year we gave to the earth,
what the sea had given us."

01:44:11.550 --> 01:44:16.060
"We lived like this, in Harmony,
for centuries and centuries."

01:44:18.140 --> 01:44:19.730
Until the day of the apocalypse.

01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:25.860
"In the sky over our planet,"

01:44:26.190 --> 01:44:29.740
"other people blindly fought out
a brutal war."

01:44:29.820 --> 01:44:32.780
"A war between people we didn't even know."

01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:21.500
Missiles loaded, sir.

01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:23.710
Engage fusio-missiles.

01:45:25.540 --> 01:45:26.500
Do you confirm, sir?

01:45:27.670 --> 01:45:29.050
Yes, I do.

01:45:31.010 --> 01:45:31.920
At your command.

01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:38.970
By the grace of god.

01:46:04.620 --> 01:46:06.210
Your daughter died during the battle.

01:46:06.630 --> 01:46:09.000
Yes, like six million others.

01:46:14.010 --> 01:46:15.590
What happened after the explosion?

01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:18.430
We drifted in space for many years.

01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:21.600
"Aboard a vessel we salvaged
from the wreckage,"

01:46:22.390 --> 01:46:24.100
"and that was half-destroyed."

01:46:30.570 --> 01:46:33.780
"This new environment was quite different
from ours."

01:46:34.030 --> 01:46:37.320
"And at first, we needed time
to understand it,"

01:46:37.990 --> 01:46:41.740
"absorbing the vast knowledge
stored in its database."

01:46:50.380 --> 01:46:52.960
"We learned languages and mathematics,"

01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:55.760
"physics, chemistry,"

01:46:56.220 --> 01:46:59.180
"and philosophy."

01:46:59.430 --> 01:47:02.930
"We learned about the millions of planets
and stars and moons"

01:47:03.020 --> 01:47:05.230
"in a universe we never knew existed."

01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:12.320
"And we learned of the countless species
who inhabit this universe."

01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:17.700
"Including humans, the ones
who destroyed our planet."

01:47:19.780 --> 01:47:22.910
"Time has not dimmed
the memories of our loss,"

01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:28.370
"but it has allowed us to let go
of our anger toward those responsible."

01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:40.840
"Then, one day, we were picked up
by scrap dealers traveling the galaxy."

01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:44.180
After a few years, their hold was full.

01:47:47.940 --> 01:47:51.520
"And they went off to sell their cargo
on a huge construction site."

01:47:54.110 --> 01:47:56.110
- Alpha.
- Yes.

01:47:56.190 --> 01:48:00.990
"The city of a thousand planets,
where for hundreds of years,"

01:48:01.410 --> 01:48:03.950
"so many species have shared
their knowledge"

01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:06.080
"and intelligence with each other."

01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:10.750
"In the shadows of Alpha,
we lived undetected,"

01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:14.090
"all the while watching and learning
from each of them."

01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:20.130
"Until we acquired both the knowledge,"

01:48:20.380 --> 01:48:23.470
"and the materials
to build a vessel of our own."

01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:40.070
Our planet is gone forever,
but with what we have learned,

01:48:40.150 --> 01:48:44.280
we are now able to replicate
and restore our lost world.

01:48:44.780 --> 01:48:46.910
Amazing.

01:48:46.990 --> 01:48:48.950
There are only two things that we lack.

01:48:49.250 --> 01:48:50.540
A Mül converter.

01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:52.830
And a Pearl.

01:48:53.750 --> 01:48:56.300
The only one Tsfluri managed to salvage.

01:49:12.730 --> 01:49:15.980
We are survivors,
but that makes us witnesses.

01:49:16.570 --> 01:49:20.860
Witnesses of a past that humans
want to erase and forget forever.

01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:26.330
We can forgive, but how can we forget?

01:49:27.740 --> 01:49:30.160
So we left you no choice
but to steal the converter,

01:49:30.790 --> 01:49:32.290
and Tsfluri hired a professional.

01:49:32.370 --> 01:49:33.370
Igon Siruss.

01:49:36.130 --> 01:49:38.670
But major Valerian intervenes
and retrieves the converter.

01:49:38.750 --> 01:49:40.210
Which left you with only one choice.

01:49:40.300 --> 01:49:42.760
Kidnap the commander and force him
to tell you the truth.

01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:44.220
You know our story now.

01:49:45.220 --> 01:49:47.550
Our destiny is in your hands.

01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:07.700
Major, arrest these creatures immediately.

01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:10.500
They kidnapped me.
They're extremely dangerous.

01:50:10.540 --> 01:50:12.580
They're pearls from the planet Mül.

01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:14.500
I heard their ridiculous story.

01:50:14.580 --> 01:50:15.500
That's impossible.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:17.330
Mül was uninhabited.

01:50:17.710 --> 01:50:20.090
Their existence proves the contrary,
doesn't it?

01:50:20.170 --> 01:50:22.630
I am telling you there was no life
on the planet.

01:50:22.710 --> 01:50:25.300
The detectors were categorical.
Arrest them.

01:50:25.380 --> 01:50:26.680
How can you be so sure?

01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:29.260
Because I read the reports and...

01:50:29.350 --> 01:50:30.260
And you were on board.

01:50:33.390 --> 01:50:35.690
Yes. Yes, I was on board.

01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:39.650
And we had much more serious things
to worry about.

01:50:40.730 --> 01:50:44.700
Our cruisers were being decimated.
We lost 500,000 soldiers in a day.

01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:47.410
It was complete carnage!

01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:49.830
You were so preoccupied you didn't see

01:50:49.910 --> 01:50:52.240
the detectors indicating signs of life
on the planet.

01:50:52.370 --> 01:50:57.000
Or even worse. Perhaps you knew the planet
was inhabited and you sacrificed it.

01:50:57.580 --> 01:50:59.580
Commander, the planet is inhabited.

01:51:00.340 --> 01:51:02.630
- By primitive life forms.
- No, commander.

01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:06.170
I have detected a complex language
and huge cerebral energy.

01:51:06.260 --> 01:51:07.180
Major.

01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:10.720
History is on the march and neither you

01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:13.720
nor a bunch of savages
are gonna stand in its way.

01:51:16.020 --> 01:51:19.520
So when you realized survivors from planet
Mül were living in the heart of Alpha,

01:51:20.060 --> 01:51:22.150
you decided to erase
any trace of your mistake,

01:51:23.820 --> 01:51:25.490
rather than accept the consequences.

01:51:26.780 --> 01:51:28.820
I want no survivors.

01:51:28.910 --> 01:51:32.410
And you destroyed all the evidence
that major Samk had against you.

01:51:43.130 --> 01:51:46.590
What did you expect me to do?
It was the only way!

01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:54.600
Admitting to an error on this scale

01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:56.630
would have exposed our government
to colossal damages

01:51:56.640 --> 01:51:59.270
and compensation claims.
Our economy would never recover.

01:51:59.980 --> 01:52:03.610
In one instance, we would have lost
our supremacy and our leadership.

01:52:03.690 --> 01:52:05.400
There would have been immediate sanctions,

01:52:05.940 --> 01:52:08.740
and it's a pretty good bet that
we would have been banished from Alpha

01:52:08.820 --> 01:52:11.530
and denied access to the greatest market
of knowledge and intelligence.

01:52:11.620 --> 01:52:14.370
Is that what you would have wanted
for your fellow citizens?

01:52:16.290 --> 01:52:21.960
Leading them into ruin and degradation?
Forcing them to go backwards 1,000 years?

01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:27.170
Our council saw fit to protect our citizens
first and foremost.

01:52:27.260 --> 01:52:29.670
Is that not its duty? And mine?

01:52:30.380 --> 01:52:31.590
And yours?

01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:43.230
Or would you rather risk wrecking
our economy for the sake of a bunch of...

01:52:43.310 --> 01:52:44.230
Savages?

01:52:44.650 --> 01:52:47.360
You are totally under the influence
of these creatures.

01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:49.150
Do not confuse the issue.

01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:50.490
He's the threat!

01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:52.280
He's the enemy!

01:52:59.500 --> 01:53:03.170
You are your own worst enemy, commander.

01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:08.260
Unless you make peace with your past,
you won't have a future.

01:53:15.430 --> 01:53:19.770
Major, I order you to arrest this man.

01:53:21.310 --> 01:53:22.980
Can we talk man-to-man for a second?

01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:28.480
Major, what are you doing?

01:53:31.070 --> 01:53:32.150
I taught him how to do that.

01:53:32.950 --> 01:53:33.860
Whew!

01:53:34.530 --> 01:53:35.450
Nice talk.

01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:43.120
Move on, move on, move on!

01:53:50.340 --> 01:53:52.010
Section 1 is entering the red zone.

01:53:52.090 --> 01:53:53.970
Prepare section 2 for an advance also.

01:53:54.510 --> 01:53:56.050
Look, this was a lot of fun,

01:53:56.140 --> 01:53:57.640
but we gotta report back to our people.

01:53:58.260 --> 01:54:00.520
Here. That's yours.

01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:03.810
We'll make this right, I promise.

01:54:04.690 --> 01:54:06.610
Let's get this guy out.
Whoa, what are you doing?

01:54:06.620 --> 01:54:08.020
I'm giving them back the converter.

01:54:08.230 --> 01:54:09.440
No.

01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:10.940
The Pearl is useless without this.

01:54:11.030 --> 01:54:11.940
Yeah, but...

01:54:13.950 --> 01:54:15.290
Will you give us a second, please?

01:54:15.320 --> 01:54:16.360
What?

01:54:18.740 --> 01:54:20.540
That converter is government property.

01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:22.450
Most likely, the last one
in the whole universe.

01:54:22.540 --> 01:54:24.750
Oh. So you buy into the commander's

01:54:24.830 --> 01:54:27.630
«what's mine is mine
and what's yours is mine.» Philosophy?

01:54:27.710 --> 01:54:31.170
No, I buy into my oath of allegiance.
We have no authority to hand it over.

01:54:31.250 --> 01:54:33.420
The federation messed up
and must make amends.

01:54:33.510 --> 01:54:35.470
Yeah, I agree, but that's not
for us to decide.

01:54:36.260 --> 01:54:39.050
- Leave it to the courts.
- They're 18 light years away, Valerian.

01:54:39.140 --> 01:54:40.260
Only we can make this right.

01:54:41.350 --> 01:54:43.390
Laureline, I'm a soldier.

01:54:44.020 --> 01:54:45.190
I play by the rules.

01:54:46.350 --> 01:54:47.690
It's what makes me who I am.

01:54:54.360 --> 01:54:55.280
You see?

01:54:57.410 --> 01:54:58.950
That's why I don't want to marry you,

01:54:59.030 --> 01:55:00.870
because you really don't know what love is.

01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:02.790
Come on, this has nothing to do with love.

01:55:02.870 --> 01:55:04.450
That's where you're wrong.

01:55:05.660 --> 01:55:08.630
Love is more powerful than anything else,
Valerian.

01:55:09.830 --> 01:55:14.340
It breaks all rules and laws,
and overpowers any army or government.

01:55:15.130 --> 01:55:16.050
Just look at her.

01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:19.890
For one second, put yourself
in her position.

01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:24.720
She lost all of her people and her child,
and she's willing to forgive.

01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:27.100
That's real love.

01:55:27.730 --> 01:55:29.560
It's the trust you place in someone else,

01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:33.320
and I thought I could be
that someone else for you.

01:55:35.530 --> 01:55:37.030
- But clearly...
- You can.

01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:40.160
You are.

01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:43.410
I'd die for you.

01:55:44.490 --> 01:55:46.330
I'm not asking you to die for me.

01:55:48.290 --> 01:55:50.290
I'm asking you to trust me.

01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:13.020
All right, give it to 'em.

01:56:19.240 --> 01:56:20.160
Thank you.

01:56:30.460 --> 01:56:32.710
We are to blame
for the loss of your planet,

01:56:32.790 --> 01:56:35.550
and we'd be honored to help you
get it back.

01:56:37.170 --> 01:56:38.090
Here.

01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:53.480
It means, «thank you».

01:57:02.490 --> 01:57:04.320
Spread out. Spread out.

01:57:30.270 --> 01:57:31.550
Captain, we're locked on to you.

01:57:32.190 --> 01:57:33.810
Any sign of contamination or radiation?

01:57:34.190 --> 01:57:35.190
Zero trace of either.

01:57:36.860 --> 01:57:37.980
It doesn't make any sense.

01:59:10.280 --> 01:59:11.980
Didn't you say you wanted to go
to the beach?

01:59:18.040 --> 01:59:19.830
Our daughter made a good choice.

01:59:21.130 --> 01:59:22.750
She can rest in peace now.

01:59:31.720 --> 01:59:32.810
We must leave now.

01:59:33.180 --> 01:59:34.850
May you and your people live in peace

01:59:34.930 --> 01:59:37.560
wherever you may venture in space and time.

01:59:49.610 --> 01:59:51.700
Explosives in place, general.
We are operational.

01:59:52.580 --> 01:59:55.160
Received. Evacuate the zone.
You have four minutes.

01:59:57.870 --> 01:59:58.790
Copy that.

02:00:02.420 --> 02:00:04.420
Father, there are hundreds of soldiers

02:00:04.500 --> 02:00:06.970
- all around the spaceship.
- We will be gone in a minute.

02:00:06.980 --> 02:00:08.960
The troops are in position,
you don't have a minute.

02:00:08.970 --> 02:00:11.190
You have no means of communication
with the outside world?

02:00:11.200 --> 02:00:13.060
If we stop jamming signals,
we are defenseless.

02:00:13.070 --> 02:00:16.040
If you don't allow me to communicate
with them you'll be defenseless forever.

02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:23.480
Just one call.

02:00:26.900 --> 02:00:28.320
- Disarm the signal.
- Thank you!

02:00:35.580 --> 02:00:38.250
The wall stopped moving.
Something's going on.

02:00:39.160 --> 02:00:41.120
Maintain your position.
We're analyzing the data.

02:00:43.210 --> 02:00:44.470
I can't believe they'd do that.

02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:45.720
The general followed procedure.

02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:47.050
Yeah, I hate procedure.

02:00:47.630 --> 02:00:50.380
"Captain, the data shows that
they have built some kind of vessel"

02:00:50.470 --> 02:00:51.380
"beyond the wall."

02:00:57.390 --> 02:00:58.350
Contact with the enemy.

02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:01.770
Give me a physical description.

02:01:01.850 --> 02:01:03.860
Same creatures who kidnapped the commander.

02:01:09.990 --> 02:01:11.780
They showing any signs of hostility?

02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:17.040
Not really.

02:01:18.580 --> 02:01:20.580
- Are they armed?
"- No."

02:01:25.080 --> 02:01:28.550
General, we're picking up a signal
from the 2005 destiny module.

02:01:29.420 --> 02:01:31.300
- What?
- Sounds like major Valerian.

02:01:35.830 --> 02:01:38.190
- Patch him through.
- Major, you're on line with the general.

02:01:38.220 --> 02:01:39.310
"- Major?"
- Yeah.

02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:42.470
Major Valerian and sergeant Laureline.
We're alive and on the inside of the wall.

02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:43.900
"Call off the assault immediately."

02:01:43.980 --> 02:01:45.560
Major, I can't read your DNA codes.

02:01:45.940 --> 02:01:48.070
You know the procedure.
I have to be certain it's you.

02:01:48.150 --> 02:01:51.820
There is no time for dumb-ass procedures!
We are here with a whole species of people

02:01:51.900 --> 02:01:54.530
you've already wiped out once!
The pearls of planet Mül!

02:01:54.610 --> 02:01:58.030
"So tell your men to back off
before you commit a second genocide!"

02:01:58.120 --> 02:02:00.830
- That's definitely her temper.
- Planet Mül was uninhabited.

02:02:00.910 --> 02:02:03.040
Come on. You know that's not true.

02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:05.080
The commander was there.
He gave the orders.

02:02:05.630 --> 02:02:08.420
And then he organized this whole procedure
to eliminate any survivors,

02:02:09.130 --> 02:02:10.410
the living proof of his mistake.

02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:12.690
"- Stop the procedure."
- Maybe that would explain

02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:14.930
why the commander was
interrogating that creature.

02:02:20.810 --> 02:02:21.810
Is the commander with you?

02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:28.400
Come on! Wakey, wakey.

02:02:30.150 --> 02:02:31.610
- You've got a call.
- What?

02:02:33.860 --> 02:02:36.160
Let's go, my friend. Time to confess.

02:02:37.570 --> 02:02:38.530
Hello?

02:02:38.620 --> 02:02:41.290
No DNA code, but voice waves match.

02:02:41.950 --> 02:02:44.210
This is general Okto-bar.
Do you read me, commander?

02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:47.130
What's going on?

02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:50.130
"We are ready to activate
the explosive device"

02:02:50.630 --> 02:02:52.800
in accordance with the orders you gave.

02:02:54.380 --> 02:02:55.970
Do you confirm those orders,

02:02:56.800 --> 02:02:58.510
or do you have anything to tell me,

02:02:59.050 --> 02:03:01.850
'that would enable me
to suspend the assault?"

02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:07.480
I am a soldier.

02:03:10.820 --> 02:03:14.780
A soldier will always choose
death over humiliation.

02:03:19.990 --> 02:03:21.030
Annihilate them all.

02:03:43.810 --> 02:03:46.230
- What the hell are you doing?
- I didn't give the orders!

02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:48.230
Captain, cease fire immediately!

02:03:48.520 --> 02:03:51.150
It's not us, it's the K-Trons.
They're shooting at us!

02:03:53.110 --> 02:03:54.030
Come on, you...

02:03:58.240 --> 02:04:00.450
I'm gonna go give Tsfluri some backup.
Keep an eye on him.

02:04:00.530 --> 02:04:03.410
Oh, he's not going anywhere.

02:04:06.330 --> 02:04:07.910
Get down! Take cover!

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:12.460
Alex, load me up with all you've got!

02:04:12.540 --> 02:04:13.500
"- Copy that."
- Thanks.

02:04:30.850 --> 02:04:33.730
- Neza, stop this countdown now!
- Yes, sir!

02:04:56.590 --> 02:04:57.710
Hurry, neza!

02:05:26.700 --> 02:05:27.790
Hurry, neza!

02:05:42.590 --> 02:05:45.050
- How much time left?
- Ten seconds!

02:05:49.020 --> 02:05:50.180
Hurry!

02:06:24.220 --> 02:06:25.130
Neza.

02:06:33.730 --> 02:06:34.810
Check for survivors.

02:07:01.090 --> 02:07:02.250
Captain, status report?

02:07:02.670 --> 02:07:04.420
Nothing's left. Just a gaping hole.

02:07:05.220 --> 02:07:08.140
They left with their spaceship.
Everything's vanished.

02:07:08.220 --> 02:07:10.680
And our agents? Valerian and Laureline?

02:07:10.760 --> 02:07:12.640
- No, nothing.
"- And the commander?"

02:07:12.720 --> 02:07:13.810
Is anyone there?

02:07:14.270 --> 02:07:15.690
Wait, I hear something.

02:07:20.310 --> 02:07:21.230
There's a body!

02:07:21.690 --> 02:07:24.860
Get me down from here, you children!

02:07:26.740 --> 02:07:27.740
It's the commander.

02:07:28.570 --> 02:07:29.410
Is he alive?

02:07:29.490 --> 02:07:31.780
Affirmative. Alive and kicking!

02:07:31.870 --> 02:07:32.790
Good.

02:07:36.210 --> 02:07:37.120
Arrest him.

02:07:40.500 --> 02:07:41.540
Help!

02:08:00.100 --> 02:08:01.900
"Do you have any idea where they left us?"

02:08:01.980 --> 02:08:04.230
"We're two hours away from vacation."

02:08:04.320 --> 02:08:06.150
I fired the distress beacons.

02:08:06.240 --> 02:08:08.240
- Two hours?
- Yeah, I know.

02:08:08.320 --> 02:08:10.660
- Two hours alone with me, what a drag.
- Hmm.

02:08:11.320 --> 02:08:13.280
No kidding. It's basically an eternity.

02:08:14.790 --> 02:08:15.700
Hey.

02:08:17.910 --> 02:08:20.670
Now that our mission's over
maybe we can finish our conversation.

02:08:20.750 --> 02:08:22.000
What conversation?

02:08:22.080 --> 02:08:23.750
We were talking about the future.

02:08:24.590 --> 02:08:27.010
Really? And what does the future hold?

02:08:32.010 --> 02:08:32.930
You.

02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:34.680
Me.

02:08:37.020 --> 02:08:37.930
Us.

02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:43.440
Happy birthday.

02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:48.780
Thank you, Valerian.

02:08:50.280 --> 02:08:51.740
That is so romantic.

02:08:52.660 --> 02:08:54.160
Did you really think of this yourself?

02:08:54.240 --> 02:08:57.080
Yeah. You mean so much to me, you know?

02:08:58.830 --> 02:08:59.750
Laureline...

02:09:02.040 --> 02:09:04.130
Will you do me the honor of becoming
my wife?

02:09:07.130 --> 02:09:08.210
For better or worse?

02:09:09.420 --> 02:09:11.840
Uh, worse? Is that negotiable?

02:09:12.130 --> 02:09:13.050
No.

02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:15.600
All right, then.

02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:29.940
Is that a yes?

02:09:30.030 --> 02:09:31.280
It's a maybe.

02:09:33.110 --> 02:09:35.200
I'm confused. Is this how love works?

02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:37.700
No, this is how I work.

02:09:38.330 --> 02:09:40.870
You spent a day in a woman's body,
did you not learn anything?

02:09:41.500 --> 02:09:42.410
Yeah.

02:09:44.420 --> 02:09:45.500
I did learn something.

02:09:46.540 --> 02:09:47.460
What?

02:09:48.670 --> 02:09:51.130
I want only your name on my playlist.

02:09:59.940 --> 02:10:05.900
~I gotta find myself gonna find it now
I gotta be a man I gotta find him now~

02:10:05.990 --> 02:10:10.490
~I gotta be a man, I gotta be the man~

02:10:11.410 --> 02:10:14.410
~They wanna take me down
Wanna see me crawl~

02:10:14.500 --> 02:10:21.500
~I gotta be a man I gotta find him now
I gotta be a man I gotta be the man~

02:10:22.670 --> 02:10:25.670
~I gotta find myself gonna find it now~

02:10:25.750 --> 02:10:32.720
~I gotta be a man I gotta find him now
I gotta be a man I gotta be the man~

02:10:34.140 --> 02:10:39.810
~When I come to town for the last time
Pull up in a fast car for the first time~

02:10:39.900 --> 02:10:44.320
~I'm gonna say goodbye
You didn't see me cry~

02:10:45.190 --> 02:10:50.450
~I got a million on my soul
I go build an army on my own~

02:10:50.820 --> 02:10:53.570
~They put a bounty on my soul~

02:10:55.780 --> 02:11:01.160
~Won't you leave me alone more
Oh leave me alone more~

02:11:01.410 --> 02:11:06.630
~I gotta be a man I gotta be a man~

02:11:07.050 --> 02:11:12.380
~Won't you leave me alone more
Oh leave me alone more~

02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:17.640
~I gotta be a man I gotta be a man~

02:11:25.060 --> 02:11:30.530
~I gotta find myself gonna find it now
I gotta be a man I gotta find him now~

02:11:30.610 --> 02:11:32.950
~I gotta be the man~

02:11:34.780 --> 02:11:40.080
~Your stare makes me freeze
But I can't stay still~

02:11:40.370 --> 02:11:45.460
~Those eyes keep me up longer
Than any other pill~

02:11:45.540 --> 02:11:51.130
~And I know being together
We feel like forever~

02:11:51.340 --> 02:11:57.010
~But now more than ever
I feel everything Feeling everything~

02:11:57.100 --> 02:12:02.430
~You make me feel so crazy
I've never felt so sane~

02:12:02.850 --> 02:12:07.690
~Beaten up by love
But the feelings still remain~

02:12:07.770 --> 02:12:11.690
~You should know
If you want it it's yours~

02:12:11.770 --> 02:12:14.730
~So come and get it right now~

02:12:14.820 --> 02:12:19.490
~More than ever I feel everything
Feeling everything~

02:12:19.570 --> 02:12:24.580
~All I got I'm yours
I'll give it to you be mine~

02:12:24.660 --> 02:12:29.870
~You're in my brain I'm yours
And in my heart too be mine~

02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:35.090
~Because I am yours I want you
If you want me too I want you~

02:12:35.170 --> 02:12:41.760
~Tell me you want me too
'Cause I'll give it all to you~

02:12:41.850 --> 02:12:47.600
~I'm scared that I'm falling
Come catch me I'm falling~

02:12:47.680 --> 02:12:52.770
~My heart is calling you can't stop me
roaring I'm soaring I'm sky high~

02:12:52.860 --> 02:12:58.280
~I'm scared that I'm falling
I'm blind and I'm falling~

02:12:58.740 --> 02:13:03.530
~My love is calling
You can't stop me roaring I'm soaring~

02:13:03.620 --> 02:13:05.290
~Come jump with me and fly~

02:13:05.370 --> 02:13:09.910
~Never thought I'd fall like this~

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:14.840
~I've tripped right into
This eternal bliss~

02:13:14.920 --> 02:13:20.510
~And I know being together
We feel like forever~

02:13:20.590 --> 02:13:26.470
~But now more than ever I feel everything
Feeling everything~

02:13:26.560 --> 02:13:31.640
~All I got I'm yours
I'll give it to you be mine~

02:13:31.730 --> 02:13:36.690
~You're in my brain I'm yours
And my heart too be mine~

02:13:36.780 --> 02:13:42.030
~Because I'm yours
If you want me too~

02:13:42.110 --> 02:13:48.910
~Tell me you want me too
'Cause I'll give it all to you~

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:54.670
~I'm scared that I'm falling
Feeling everything~

02:13:58.340 --> 02:14:00.880
~Feeling everything~

02:14:04.010 --> 02:14:06.140
~Feeling everything~

02:14:09.560 --> 02:14:12.270
~Feeling everything~
