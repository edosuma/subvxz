04:26.921 --> 04:29.371
I'm gonna miss him, he's so hot.

04:29.372 --> 04:30.441
- He's fine.
- He really is,

04:30.442 --> 04:31.787
like oh my gosh.

04:31.788 --> 04:33.030
I don't get it.

04:33.031 --> 04:33.687
He's the reason
why I go to school.

04:34.620 --> 04:36.275
You guys are ridiculous.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.656
So Aim, what does
your dress look like?

04:38.657 --> 04:41.245
You seriously haven't
even mentioned it.

04:41.246 --> 04:42.178
It's pink.

04:44.836 --> 04:48.356
Pink, wow I can
almost visualize it.

04:48.357 --> 04:50.254
Oh you two know I'm not
into that sort of thing.

04:50.255 --> 04:52.083
Which is precisely your problem.

04:52.084 --> 04:53.257
Nelson likes it.

04:53.258 --> 04:54.534
Yeah, he would.

04:54.535 --> 04:55.915
You two couldn't be more perfect

04:55.916 --> 04:57.330
for each other if you tried.

04:57.331 --> 04:59.643
Not that that's bad though,

04:59.644 --> 05:01.576
I mean you both are great,

05:01.577 --> 05:03.302
it's just that you
act like you're 50.

05:03.303 --> 05:06.132
It's prom night, you
should be excited.

05:06.133 --> 05:10.654
Listen, I wanna ask you
guys something about tonight.

05:10.655 --> 05:12.518
I know you both really wanna go

05:12.519 --> 05:16.038
to the school's after
prom party but...

05:16.039 --> 05:17.731
Yeah go on.

05:19.491 --> 05:21.320
Nelson wants us to have our own

05:21.321 --> 05:23.805
after prom party, just us.

05:23.806 --> 05:25.047
What do you mean?

05:25.048 --> 05:25.877
Where?

05:25.878 --> 05:27.153
At his uncle's house.

05:27.154 --> 05:28.257
He thinks it'll
be our last chance

05:28.258 --> 05:29.881
to hang out before graduation.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.505
I don't know, I was kind
of excited for after prom.

05:34.506 --> 05:35.817
It's supposed to be a blast.

05:35.818 --> 05:37.336
And what about
Andrew and Travis?

05:37.337 --> 05:38.647
Nelson's going to
talk to them today.

05:38.648 --> 05:40.926
He's pretty sure they'll
both go along with it.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.826
Come on, I think it
could be special.

05:44.827 --> 05:46.552
Better than hanging out
with a bunch of people

05:46.553 --> 05:48.277
who really don't like me anyway.

05:48.278 --> 05:52.212
Special because you want
some alone time with Nelson?

05:52.213 --> 05:53.490
Well people like you, Amy,

05:53.491 --> 05:55.734
you just don't go out of
your way to reciprocate.

05:57.253 --> 05:59.635
Just us for old times sake?

06:03.673 --> 06:04.502
You know what?

06:05.468 --> 06:06.366
I'm in.

06:06.367 --> 06:07.400
Yes!

06:07.401 --> 06:08.229
It sounds like fun.

06:08.229 --> 06:08.920
It sounds like fun.

06:08.921 --> 06:10.230
Just us.

06:10.231 --> 06:11.473
Me too.

06:11.474 --> 06:12.819
Besides, some alone time
with Andrew may be good.

06:12.820 --> 06:14.994
He's been acting weird lately.

06:14.995 --> 06:17.653
Two months and there's
already trouble in paradise?

06:19.102 --> 06:20.931
Let's just hope Andy and
Travis go along with it.

06:20.932 --> 06:24.003
Oh, Travis will go along with
it as long as there's beer.

06:24.004 --> 06:28.664
Oh, yeah.

06:34.359 --> 06:36.706
Shit, fuckers aren't
gonna bite, are ya?

07:25.755 --> 07:26.687
Cocksucker!

07:37.664 --> 07:40.044
Hey, John, it's Benson here.

07:40.045 --> 07:41.460
Yeah, I'm down by
the river fishing

07:41.461 --> 07:45.981
and I came across a few
items that seem out of place.

07:45.982 --> 07:48.295
I've got a girl's cell
phone and sunglasses.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.367
Well, hell it's pink,
course it's a girl's.

07:52.368 --> 07:55.094
No, I can't turn
the cell phone on.

07:55.095 --> 07:55.958
No battery.

07:59.375 --> 08:00.203
What was that?

08:02.136 --> 08:02.965
Yeah.

08:04.138 --> 08:06.036
No, no, there's
no sign of anybody

08:06.037 --> 08:08.072
or a struggle or anything.

08:08.073 --> 08:10.419
It's just that what with
those girls gone missing

08:10.420 --> 08:13.181
around here for the
last few months,

08:13.182 --> 08:14.701
it just seems strange.

08:16.875 --> 08:19.084
Yeah, I can drop 'em
by the station today.

08:20.465 --> 08:22.121
Alright, I'll drop 'em by

08:22.122 --> 08:24.503
later today or first
thing tomorrow.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.368
Honestly it doesn't seem
like you're too concerned.

08:29.094 --> 08:30.095
No, I understand.

08:31.303 --> 08:32.131
Alrighty.

08:33.823 --> 08:35.687
I'll be down here
a bit more fishing.

08:36.654 --> 08:37.655
But I gotta tell ya,

08:38.966 --> 08:41.900
it's damn creepy out
here when you're alone.

08:43.730 --> 08:44.971
Yeah, you're probably right.

08:44.972 --> 08:45.904
No need to worry.

08:47.181 --> 08:48.769
Alright, I'll talk to you later.

09:09.687 --> 09:10.550
Who's there?

09:23.666 --> 09:25.667
Hey, unless you're
old Jack Hardison,

09:25.668 --> 09:28.429
I suggest you get your
ass off his property!

11:20.438 --> 11:21.680
Why do you have your books?

11:21.681 --> 11:23.129
It's not like anyone's gonna

11:23.130 --> 11:24.717
be doing homework
on prom weekend.

11:24.718 --> 11:27.927
I want to study for the
biology test next week.

11:27.928 --> 11:29.170
Wow.

11:29.171 --> 11:32.621
You seriously need to
loosen up sometimes.

11:32.622 --> 11:36.453
Please just tell me you are
excited for tonight, right?

11:36.454 --> 11:39.145
I mean like, oh my god, we
got three hours until prom.

11:39.146 --> 11:40.664
Of course I am!

11:40.665 --> 11:41.803
I'm more excited
for what happen.

11:41.804 --> 11:42.667
Hey!

11:42.668 --> 11:43.943
Oh my god!

11:43.944 --> 11:45.704
Didn't mean to scare
you, I'm sorry, babe.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.948
Just wanted to see if
you a ride home tonight.

11:50.399 --> 11:52.641
Aren't you guys
going to get tuxes?

11:52.642 --> 11:54.126
Yeah, but I still have
time to take you home.

11:54.127 --> 11:55.679
Oh, that's okay, we can walk.

11:55.680 --> 11:56.508
You sure?

11:56.508 --> 11:57.371
Yes.

11:57.372 --> 11:58.889
Alright.

11:58.890 --> 12:00.719
Well, I guess I'll pick you
up at a quarter till six.

12:00.720 --> 12:01.927
Okay.

12:01.928 --> 12:03.723
Can't wait to see
how beautiful you look.

12:06.070 --> 12:06.898
So.

12:08.589 --> 12:09.728
Is everything set for tonight?

12:09.729 --> 12:10.695
You told your parents
you're staying

12:10.696 --> 12:12.178
at my place and everything?

12:12.179 --> 12:14.594
Yeah, they think we're all
going to the after prom party

12:14.595 --> 12:16.217
and then I'm going
to your house.

12:16.218 --> 12:17.597
Awesome.

12:17.598 --> 12:19.323
You know the more
I think about it,

12:19.324 --> 12:21.291
us having our own
little get together,

12:21.292 --> 12:22.499
the more excited I get.

12:23.673 --> 12:25.053
It's gonna be fun.

12:25.054 --> 12:26.261
So what's the place like?

12:26.262 --> 12:27.435
What place?

12:27.436 --> 12:29.644
Nelson's uncle's place?

12:29.645 --> 12:30.473
Oh, I don't know.

12:30.473 --> 12:31.405
I've never been there.

12:31.406 --> 12:33.510
I just know it's by a lake.

12:33.511 --> 12:34.374
Says it's secluded.

12:34.375 --> 12:35.857
Mm, perfect.

12:35.858 --> 12:37.894
Well, I'm gonna run home

12:37.895 --> 12:39.343
really quick and grab my stuff.

12:39.344 --> 12:41.138
I'll be over at
your house in a few?

12:41.139 --> 12:44.624
Alright just, Amy, please
hurry, you know how Liv is.

12:44.625 --> 12:45.867
Yeah.

12:45.868 --> 12:46.731
Bye.

12:46.732 --> 12:47.870
Bye.

12:51.494 --> 12:53.012
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,

12:53.013 --> 12:55.704
to the red carpet unveiling
of Hoover High's potential

12:55.705 --> 12:59.882
next prom king, the ever
dapper, Mr. Nelson Hardison.

13:00.987 --> 13:01.987
Looking sharp.

13:01.988 --> 13:03.229
Seriously, folks,

13:03.230 --> 13:05.507
where are you gonna find
a better looking kid?

13:05.508 --> 13:08.510
Oh shit, I might've
spoken too soon.

13:08.511 --> 13:10.719
Yes, indeed, it
appears that Nelson

13:10.720 --> 13:12.445
has some tough
competition in the form

13:12.446 --> 13:15.345
of All-American
jock, Travis Bock.

13:15.346 --> 13:17.002
Come on, quit being gay.

13:17.003 --> 13:18.520
Yeah, gimme that.

13:18.521 --> 13:21.076
Come on, let the audience
get a good look at you.

13:22.318 --> 13:23.147
Come on, man!

13:23.148 --> 13:24.595
Ooh!

13:24.596 --> 13:27.322
Whoa, ladies and gentlemen,
it's your prom queen.

13:27.323 --> 13:28.255
Come on, dude.

13:28.256 --> 13:29.980
Hey, hey is our Andrew shy?

13:29.981 --> 13:31.257
Ooh!

13:31.258 --> 13:32.259
Buddy!

13:34.917 --> 13:35.780
Aw.

13:40.750 --> 13:42.131
We do look damn good.

13:43.305 --> 13:44.926
Yes, let's hope
the ladies think so.

13:44.927 --> 13:45.963
Are you kidding me?

13:47.585 --> 13:48.828
We look irresistible.

13:50.243 --> 13:52.485
I didn't know this was gonna
be a legendary night, man.

13:54.350 --> 13:55.455
Alright, alright.

14:01.841 --> 14:02.979
â™ª Finally going to prom

14:04.567 --> 14:05.567
You look hot in that though.

14:05.568 --> 14:06.672
You look so cute.

14:06.673 --> 14:07.846
Thank you!

14:07.847 --> 14:09.088
Like the perfect dress.

14:09.089 --> 14:09.918
I really like the back too.

14:09.919 --> 14:11.194
Yeah, see?

14:11.195 --> 14:12.678
Now that's what I'm
talking about, Amy.

14:12.679 --> 14:13.611
You look hot.

14:13.612 --> 14:14.853
You're just saying that.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.785
Seriously, Amy,
you look amazing.

14:16.786 --> 14:17.718
Thank you.

14:22.102 --> 14:23.827
The guys are here.

14:23.828 --> 14:25.035
Oh boy.

14:25.036 --> 14:25.865
You ready?

14:25.866 --> 14:27.727
Yeah, let's go.

14:27.728 --> 14:29.315
Molly, grab your overnight bag.

14:29.316 --> 14:30.179
Okay.

14:35.840 --> 14:37.599
Let's get this
killer night started.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.807
Oh yeah, very surprising.

15:15.086 --> 15:17.053
I just see them in the bedroom.

15:17.054 --> 15:21.126
So, ladies, was your prom
experience all that you wanted?

15:21.127 --> 15:22.679
It was perfect.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.992
Eh, it was nice, but what
was the deal with the music?

15:24.993 --> 15:27.580
It was from like 2005.

15:27.581 --> 15:29.928
But the music
doesn't matter, Molly.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.826
It's the experience.

15:31.827 --> 15:33.310
A rite of passage, right?

15:35.451 --> 15:37.728
Our final gathering with our
classmates before graduation.

15:37.729 --> 15:39.213
Oh, what the hell.

15:39.214 --> 15:41.699
Yeah, well they still
could've had better music.

15:44.046 --> 15:46.910
I agree with Amy,
it was pretty perfect.

15:48.154 --> 15:50.603
But the night is not over.

15:50.604 --> 15:51.880
Yeah, speaking of which,

15:51.881 --> 15:53.503
if y'all still want to
go to the after prom,

15:53.504 --> 15:54.505
I mean we still can.

15:55.851 --> 15:57.369
Hell no, man!

15:57.370 --> 15:59.164
I got the beer!

15:59.165 --> 16:00.959
There's no way we're backing
out of this house now.

16:00.960 --> 16:01.960
I'm fucking hyped.

16:01.961 --> 16:02.789
Alright, sweet.

16:03.652 --> 16:04.998
Anyone else want to stay?

16:07.207 --> 16:08.036
- Alright, great!
- Yes!

16:08.036 --> 16:08.968
Well let's go.

16:08.969 --> 16:10.071
30 minutes and we'll be there.

16:11.384 --> 16:12.212
Party!

16:28.988 --> 16:30.333
So, Nelson, your uncle

16:30.334 --> 16:31.991
doesn't mind us using his house?

16:33.095 --> 16:34.509
Well I mean, he
doesn't exactly know,

16:34.510 --> 16:36.581
but I'm pretty sure
he'd be fine with it.

16:37.755 --> 16:39.238
Plus he's out of town
for his job anyway,

16:39.239 --> 16:41.965
so as long as we don't trash
the place, should be good.

16:41.966 --> 16:43.622
You didn't tell
me he doesn't know.

16:43.623 --> 16:45.072
It's okay.

16:45.073 --> 16:46.418
Promise, we're fine.

16:46.419 --> 16:49.007
Well, okay, I mean I
can't make any promises

16:49.008 --> 16:51.319
about not tearing
the place up, my boy.

16:51.320 --> 16:52.631
Especially with this one.

16:53.530 --> 16:55.876
Shut up!

16:58.431 --> 17:00.052
So what do you
guys think happened

17:00.053 --> 17:01.365
to all those missing girls?

17:03.056 --> 17:04.713
My guess is that they ran away.

17:06.094 --> 17:07.541
Yeah, I mean who would want
to stay in this shit hole?

17:08.751 --> 17:10.511
So five girls
just decided to run

17:10.512 --> 17:12.547
away within months
of each other?

17:12.548 --> 17:14.031
Why not?

17:14.032 --> 17:15.481
I don't buy it.

17:15.482 --> 17:16.931
So what,

17:16.932 --> 17:18.897
think a serial killer's
stalking our area?

17:18.898 --> 17:22.040
Come on, Olivia, there's no
serial killer around here.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.179
Yeah, man, I agree.

17:23.180 --> 17:24.594
This place is definitely
not that cool.

17:24.595 --> 17:27.010
So a serial killer is cool?

17:27.011 --> 17:28.425
Nice.

17:28.425 --> 17:29.909
No, I didn't mean it

17:29.910 --> 17:30.739
- like that.
- You know that's

17:30.740 --> 17:31.980
not what he meant.

17:31.981 --> 17:34.225
It's just that, come on,
we live in hickville.

17:35.606 --> 17:36.916
Nothing like that's
gonna happen around here.

17:36.917 --> 17:38.401
Oh yeah?

17:38.402 --> 17:40.092
That's funny,
because it does seem

17:40.093 --> 17:41.300
to be happening around here.

17:41.301 --> 17:43.130
Olivia, calm down.

17:43.131 --> 17:45.166
Let's change the subject please.

17:45.167 --> 17:48.411
Guys, remember this is
supposed to be a party night.

17:48.412 --> 17:49.344
Fine.

17:49.344 --> 17:50.241
How much longer?

17:50.242 --> 17:51.346
We're almost there.

17:53.210 --> 17:54.727
Who's out here this late?

17:54.728 --> 17:57.247
Probably someone
fishing for catfish.

17:57.248 --> 17:59.249
A lot of people
do that at night.

17:59.250 --> 18:00.182
Oh.

18:00.183 --> 18:02.081
Yeah, random fact of the day.

18:03.979 --> 18:04.807
Yo!

18:06.085 --> 18:10.122
Nelson, my boy,
this place is legit!

18:10.123 --> 18:12.090
Definitely secluded
like you said.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.506
I was actually just
thinking how creepy it looks.

18:14.507 --> 18:16.991
Ugh, don't you start with
that spooky shit now too.

18:16.992 --> 18:19.649
Come on, guys, it's gonna
be totally off the hook.

18:19.650 --> 18:20.891
Alright, let's
just get our stuff

18:20.892 --> 18:22.791
and y'all can check
it out yourselves.

18:24.379 --> 18:25.207
Alright.

18:26.070 --> 18:27.450
Okay, let's go.

18:48.817 --> 18:50.611
Hey, Drew, help
me with the bags?

18:50.612 --> 18:52.338
Yeah for sure, man.

18:53.546 --> 18:54.546
Yo!

18:54.547 --> 18:55.857
Live it up!

18:55.858 --> 18:57.376
This place is dope!

18:57.377 --> 18:59.965
Let's get this party started!

18:59.966 --> 19:01.725
Travis style!

19:01.726 --> 19:03.796
You sound exactly
how your tuxedo looks.

19:03.797 --> 19:06.040
Bro, there's nobody around.

19:06.041 --> 19:07.352
Um, yeah, there's that person

19:07.353 --> 19:09.733
who was parked
alongside the road.

19:09.734 --> 19:11.183
Ugh, Olivia.

19:11.184 --> 19:12.806
I say let's get inside.

19:14.118 --> 19:15.705
Yeah.

19:15.706 --> 19:17.327
Okay, let's go.

19:36.554 --> 19:37.383
Ah ha!

19:38.798 --> 19:40.316
Guess uncle never changes
his old hiding spots.

20:13.453 --> 20:15.766
Well, this sure beats
the after prom party.

20:17.975 --> 20:21.667
It's actually not as bad
as I thought it would be.

20:21.668 --> 20:23.324
Remember this is
supposed to be about

20:23.325 --> 20:25.464
us being together
not the location.

20:25.465 --> 20:27.950
Yeah, I say we kick back,

20:29.020 --> 20:30.298
start having us some fun.

20:31.195 --> 20:32.678
Seriously?

20:32.679 --> 20:35.337
Nah uh, Amy, none of that
goody two shoes shit tonight.

20:36.373 --> 20:37.236
Okay.

20:41.585 --> 20:44.345
Okay, I want
to get out of this dress

20:44.346 --> 20:46.209
before doing anything else.

20:46.210 --> 20:47.176
Where can I change, Nels?

20:47.177 --> 20:48.798
Take it off right here, baby.

20:48.799 --> 20:51.007
Yeah, you wish.

20:51.008 --> 20:51.836
Bedrooms are down the hall.

20:51.836 --> 20:52.630
Just take your pick.

20:52.631 --> 20:53.906
Perfect.

20:53.907 --> 20:54.598
Mind if I can go
with you to change?

20:54.598 --> 20:55.564
Yeah, come on.

20:55.565 --> 20:56.737
Amy, you want to come with?

20:56.738 --> 20:58.048
Oh no, I'm okay.

20:58.049 --> 21:00.396
This dress is actually
pretty comfortable so.

21:00.397 --> 21:02.985
I believe it considering
it looks like a nightgown.

21:04.193 --> 21:05.815
Oohh!

21:05.816 --> 21:08.576
So Amy can be vulgar.

21:08.577 --> 21:09.957
Cute, cute.

21:13.686 --> 21:15.065
Andrew, come on, no, no, no, no.

21:15.066 --> 21:16.515
We don't want a
striptease, okay?

21:16.516 --> 21:18.034
Relax, dude.

21:18.035 --> 21:18.863
I'm not getting naked.

21:18.864 --> 21:20.105
Oh, my, god.

21:20.106 --> 21:22.797
Send in the duffle bag, man.

21:22.798 --> 21:26.042
Yeah, we might as
well all change right here.

21:26.043 --> 21:29.148
Amy, get ready for a show.

21:29.149 --> 21:30.081
No, no.

21:30.081 --> 21:30.910
Oh!

21:31.980 --> 21:34.430
The shark is a
metaphor for my penis.

21:34.431 --> 21:36.190
Oh, my god.

21:36.191 --> 21:38.192
I don't wanna see that!

21:38.193 --> 21:39.504
What are you doing!

21:39.505 --> 21:42.472
I feel uncomfortable.

21:42.473 --> 21:43.509
I feel uncomfortable.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.890
What's that smell?

21:46.891 --> 21:49.100
This is yours and Andrew's room.

21:50.032 --> 21:51.032
I don't think so.

21:51.033 --> 21:52.620
The bed hasn't even been made.

21:52.621 --> 21:54.657
I'd rather sleep in the truck.

21:54.658 --> 21:56.624
Are you starting to regret this?

21:56.625 --> 21:57.694
Honestly?

21:57.695 --> 21:59.109
Of course.

21:59.110 --> 22:00.318
A little.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.181
This place what it
gives me the creeps.

22:01.182 --> 22:03.080
Yeah, I hear you.

22:04.530 --> 22:07.014
But we might as well make
the best out of it, okay?

22:07.015 --> 22:07.981
Will you unzip me?

22:07.981 --> 22:08.810
Yeah.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.306
What the hell?

22:22.307 --> 22:23.444
There's someone outside.

22:23.445 --> 22:24.308
They're watching us!

22:24.309 --> 22:26.413
I don't see anything.

22:26.414 --> 22:27.276
Someone's out there, Molly.

22:27.277 --> 22:28.449
He left, I swear.

22:28.450 --> 22:30.176
Okay, okay, hold on.

22:41.498 --> 22:42.568
Nobody's there.

22:45.674 --> 22:47.365
Shit.

22:47.366 --> 22:48.435
I know someone was out there.

22:48.436 --> 22:50.333
He must've ran off.

22:50.334 --> 22:52.922
Maybe it was just one of
the guys messing with us.

22:52.923 --> 22:54.406
I don't know.

22:54.407 --> 22:55.683
I guess, look,

22:55.684 --> 22:57.340
let's just get back out
there with the others.

22:57.341 --> 22:58.548
Okay, whatever you say.

22:58.549 --> 22:59.516
Turn around.

23:10.665 --> 23:12.217
We should play a game.

23:12.218 --> 23:13.391
A game?

23:13.392 --> 23:14.220
Like Monopoly?

23:15.117 --> 23:16.773
Only if it's strip Monopoly.

23:16.774 --> 23:19.500
You guys are such cliches.

23:19.501 --> 23:22.158
Oh, okay, okay.

23:22.159 --> 23:23.402
Oh, okay.

23:47.805 --> 23:49.496
Whoa!

24:05.789 --> 24:09.516
Okay, Olivia thought she saw
someone outside the window.

24:09.517 --> 24:11.794
It wasn't one of
you asses, was it?

24:11.795 --> 24:13.312
You saw someone outside?

24:13.313 --> 24:15.487
Wasn't us, can guarantee that.

24:15.488 --> 24:17.352
He's right, they were
here the whole time.

24:19.009 --> 24:20.250
You sure you saw someone, babe?

24:20.251 --> 24:22.321
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

24:22.322 --> 24:25.324
You think we should
leave or call the cops?

24:25.325 --> 24:27.395
No, guys, come on.

24:27.396 --> 24:30.226
Could've been anybody, like a
neighbor or someone fishing.

24:30.227 --> 24:32.815
You said there
weren't any neighbors!

24:32.816 --> 24:35.369
I mean there are people
who live down the road.

24:35.370 --> 24:36.543
Maybe one of them
saw us come up here

24:36.544 --> 24:38.717
and they're just
checking things out.

24:38.718 --> 24:40.201
But like I said, we're fine.

24:40.202 --> 24:42.445
I came here every
summer as a kid.

24:42.446 --> 24:43.826
Yeah.

24:43.827 --> 24:44.862
No use harping on it.

24:45.760 --> 24:47.658
Come on, Olivia, relax.

24:49.108 --> 24:51.247
Just don't expect me to
go outside anytime soon.

24:51.248 --> 24:52.076
Mm.

24:53.043 --> 24:53.871
Okay.

24:56.840 --> 24:58.047
Oh, what?

24:58.048 --> 24:59.462
We should watch a movie.

24:59.463 --> 25:00.291
What you got?

25:01.327 --> 25:03.293
There's a bunch here, bro.

25:03.294 --> 25:07.505
We got Mutilator, Slaughter
High, Splatter University,

25:08.852 --> 25:11.025
Motel Hell, yo, these
are cheesy as fuck!

25:11.959 --> 25:14.304
Ugh, who watches this shit?

25:14.305 --> 25:15.513
Are you kidding me?

25:15.514 --> 25:17.342
Come on, these are
from the golden age

25:17.343 --> 25:19.932
of horror, '80s slashers.

25:21.381 --> 25:23.106
Man, me and my cousin used
to watch these all the time,

25:23.107 --> 25:26.524
especially at night after
spending a long day at the lake.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.664
Fond memories, man.

25:28.665 --> 25:30.907
Your parents let you watch them.

25:30.908 --> 25:32.184
No.

25:32.185 --> 25:33.738
My uncle did.

25:33.739 --> 25:35.256
He loved these movies.

25:35.257 --> 25:38.122
Probably shouldn't have,
but let us do it anyways.

25:39.227 --> 25:40.365
You think?

25:40.366 --> 25:42.195
The Mutilator, really?

25:43.127 --> 25:44.611
Try to come to have fun.

25:44.612 --> 25:45.957
Well I say we pop one in.

25:46.787 --> 25:48.028
No way, guys,

25:48.029 --> 25:49.892
I'm not watching some
blood slasher flick

25:49.893 --> 25:51.687
when I'm already
extremely creeped out.

25:51.688 --> 25:54.172
Well shit, I don't
care what y'all do,

25:54.173 --> 25:56.243
but I am definitely watching
one of those bad boys later.

25:56.244 --> 25:57.245
Hey, hey.

25:58.280 --> 25:59.487
Actually, I'm gonna go put

25:59.488 --> 26:00.661
the rest of the
beer in the fridge.

26:00.662 --> 26:03.008
Does anyone want to join me?

26:03.009 --> 26:03.838
I will.

26:07.531 --> 26:09.291
Y'all figure out
what y'all want to do, okay?

26:11.190 --> 26:11.880
- You okay?
- Yeah.

26:13.330 --> 26:14.227
Where's the light?

26:15.297 --> 26:16.746
In the corner.

26:16.747 --> 26:17.645
Oh, yeah.

26:21.787 --> 26:23.028
You got that?

26:23.029 --> 26:28.034
Yeah.

26:35.663 --> 26:39.079
I thought you said your uncle
hasn't been here for awhile.

26:39.080 --> 26:40.598
He hasn't, why?

26:40.599 --> 26:42.980
Then who has this milk,
it's still fresh, isn't it?

26:44.257 --> 26:45.775
Yeah, I guess.

26:45.776 --> 26:48.606
He's out of town for his job,
so I know he hasn't been here.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.193
Look maybe we should just go.

26:50.194 --> 26:52.126
This place hasn't felt
right since we got here.

26:52.127 --> 26:54.612
Babe, look, it
could've been anybody.

26:54.613 --> 26:58.616
You know, someone, I guess
a friend or something.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.445
'Cause I know he let people
use his house in the past.

27:00.446 --> 27:01.895
What if they come back?

27:01.896 --> 27:02.724
What if?

27:02.725 --> 27:03.966
It's my uncle's house.

27:03.967 --> 27:05.761
I don't know, it's
just kinda weird.

27:05.762 --> 27:07.452
Look, we stay, we
leave first thing

27:07.453 --> 27:11.180
in the morning like
we planned, okay?

27:11.181 --> 27:12.838
We could use some alone time.

27:17.187 --> 27:20.638
Hey, let's not tell the
others about this, okay?

27:20.639 --> 27:21.915
Olivia's already
freaked out as it is.

27:21.916 --> 27:23.502
Tell the others about what?

27:23.503 --> 27:24.332
Nothing, bro.

27:25.954 --> 27:27.472
Did y'all figure out
what you want to do?

27:27.473 --> 27:28.991
What's taking you guys so long?

27:28.992 --> 27:31.994
We are gonna go explore.

27:31.995 --> 27:33.927
Spend a little time
alone together.

27:33.928 --> 27:36.101
Explore, outside?

27:36.102 --> 27:37.620
Relax.

27:37.621 --> 27:39.622
We are just going outside
to get some fresh air, okay?

27:39.623 --> 27:40.761
I don't think
that's a good idea.

27:40.762 --> 27:41.832
Sounds like a plan.

27:43.006 --> 27:45.490
Y'all should go check
out the back porch.

27:45.491 --> 27:46.871
It's a little more private.

27:46.872 --> 27:49.667
Yeah!

27:49.668 --> 27:50.668
Stay close to the house.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.635
Ugh, whatever, dad.

27:52.636 --> 27:54.810
We are gonna go.

27:54.811 --> 27:56.950
Have fun with those two though.

27:56.951 --> 27:58.124
They're fighting again.

27:59.263 --> 28:01.679
This is so not a good idea.

28:01.680 --> 28:05.165
Seriously, Amy, this
is not Camp Crystal Lake.

28:05.166 --> 28:08.168
You know, you worrying so much

28:08.169 --> 28:09.688
isn't making this a fun night.

28:11.241 --> 28:13.346
Sorry, I just...

28:16.108 --> 28:17.522
You know what?

28:17.523 --> 28:18.523
You're right.

28:18.524 --> 28:20.801
Let's go referee
Andy and Olivia.

28:20.802 --> 28:21.700
That's my girl.

28:22.839 --> 28:23.702
You're safe.

28:23.703 --> 28:24.840
No more worrying, okay?

28:24.841 --> 28:25.704
Okay.

28:30.743 --> 28:34.988
Yo, I hate to admit it, but
it is pretty creepy out here.

28:34.989 --> 28:36.023
Really?

28:36.024 --> 28:37.093
Yeah.

28:37.094 --> 28:38.716
I think it's nice.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.822
Hey, isn't the river
just across the road?

28:42.099 --> 28:43.652
Uh, I think so.

28:44.999 --> 28:46.414
We should go check it out.

28:47.795 --> 28:52.177
You know, a nice, romantic
walk along the water.

28:52.178 --> 28:53.972
You for real?

28:53.973 --> 28:54.802
Hell no.

28:56.010 --> 28:57.217
Geez.

28:57.218 --> 28:58.012
Why not?

28:59.703 --> 29:01.393
It's pitch black out.

29:01.394 --> 29:03.293
Come on, Travis,
don't be a pussy!

29:05.226 --> 29:06.951
Fuck you, Molly!

29:06.952 --> 29:08.642
You want to go down
there in the dark?

29:08.643 --> 29:10.092
I'm not gonna stop you!

29:10.093 --> 29:12.647
Come on, Travis, you
don't have to be like this.

29:15.132 --> 29:16.581
You could be with someone.

29:16.582 --> 29:17.548
What, quit it!

29:17.549 --> 29:19.204
Dude, what the fuck, Travis?

29:19.205 --> 29:23.105
I am so sick of you thinking
that I will do anything

29:23.106 --> 29:25.072
for you if you just
blow me or fuck me!

29:25.073 --> 29:29.042
Are you seriously
complaining about fucking me?

29:29.043 --> 29:29.871
Yeah!

29:29.872 --> 29:31.527
Yeah, definitely!

29:31.528 --> 29:33.840
That's all our
relationship has become.

29:33.841 --> 29:36.774
Me fucking you and then
doing something for you

29:36.775 --> 29:40.191
or bringing you somewhere
or buying you some shit!

29:40.192 --> 29:42.745
Just to have you act
like a bitch afterward.

29:42.746 --> 29:46.059
I can fuck anyone
I want to, Molly!

29:46.060 --> 29:47.474
I kinda wanted more
than that from you.

29:47.475 --> 29:50.891
Spare me the perfect
relationship bullshit, Travis!

29:50.892 --> 29:55.068
If you want to go and fuck
any of those other bitches,

29:55.069 --> 29:56.586
go for it!

29:56.587 --> 29:59.072
Because that's what this
is really about, isn't it?

29:59.073 --> 30:00.418
We're going off to college soon

30:00.419 --> 30:02.835
and you want to be able
to fuck other girls!

30:03.698 --> 30:04.664
So fucking typical.

30:05.734 --> 30:07.390
Whatever you say, Molly.

30:07.391 --> 30:09.668
Whatever makes you feel better

30:09.669 --> 30:11.809
about being such a
shitty girlfriend!

30:11.810 --> 30:13.845
You know what?

30:13.846 --> 30:15.467
Fuck you, Travis!

30:15.468 --> 30:17.607
Oh, fuck!

30:17.608 --> 30:19.300
Molly, where are you going?

30:21.095 --> 30:22.820
Come on, don't be stupid!

30:22.821 --> 30:25.512
No, stupid was
ever getting involved

30:25.513 --> 30:27.446
with your loser ass
in the first place.

30:30.104 --> 30:30.932
Fine.

30:36.420 --> 30:38.594
Yo, I'm serious, this
creepy rocking chair

30:38.595 --> 30:40.354
my grandma got at
some garage sale

30:40.355 --> 30:42.770
used to rock by itself at night.

30:42.771 --> 30:44.358
I saw it.

30:44.359 --> 30:46.257
Yeah, okay, bullshit!

30:46.258 --> 30:48.431
Next you'll say, oh my
clown doll attacked me

30:48.432 --> 30:50.640
when I was a kid.

30:50.641 --> 30:52.953
Wait, so you don't
believe in the paranormal?

30:52.954 --> 30:54.437
Well, I'm just saying,

30:54.438 --> 30:57.613
mostly all paranormal
experiences can be

30:57.614 --> 31:00.272
rationally explained
scientifically.

31:01.273 --> 31:02.860
You said most.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.620
So the rocking chair
could've been haunted.

31:04.621 --> 31:06.035
- Mmhmm.
- Okay, whatever.

31:09.522 --> 31:10.695
Give me a beer.

31:10.696 --> 31:12.179
Where's Molly?

31:12.180 --> 31:14.112
She went on a walk, okay?

31:14.113 --> 31:16.287
You let her go by herself?

31:16.288 --> 31:17.736
She wanted to be alone, Amy.

31:17.737 --> 31:19.221
Ugh, can I get a damn beer?

31:19.222 --> 31:20.532
You know, Travis,

31:20.533 --> 31:23.467
I'm pretty sure it's not
okay to leave her alone.

31:25.504 --> 31:27.125
It's fine!

31:27.126 --> 31:28.886
Listen, it's not a big deal.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.958
Well, I think it
is, please go get her.

31:36.101 --> 31:37.618
Fine, fuck.

31:37.619 --> 31:40.104
I'll be the one to go
get Travis's girlfriend.

31:40.105 --> 31:40.933
No!

31:40.934 --> 31:42.865
I said she'll be back.

31:42.866 --> 31:46.524
If she wants to be alone
then fucking let her be!

31:46.525 --> 31:48.215
Fine, five minutes, Travis.

31:48.216 --> 31:49.734
If she's not back
in five minutes,

31:49.735 --> 31:51.736
I will get her
myself if I have to.

31:51.737 --> 31:53.324
Oh, okay, great.

31:53.325 --> 31:54.291
Whatever.

31:54.292 --> 31:56.223
Can I get a fucking beer?

32:00.056 --> 32:01.504
Thanks, Amy.

32:01.505 --> 32:02.334
Asshole!

32:08.236 --> 32:09.927
I seriously do not
want to see your

32:09.928 --> 32:11.860
fucking face right now, Travis!

32:15.105 --> 32:16.141
I'm serious!

32:23.734 --> 32:25.701
What the hell?

32:25.702 --> 32:27.014
Grow the fuck up already!

32:28.118 --> 32:29.739
Just leave me alone.

32:36.782 --> 32:37.610
Travis?

32:48.242 --> 32:49.208
Who are you?

32:54.248 --> 32:55.042
Uh.

32:57.699 --> 32:58.562
I'm just...

33:59.313 --> 34:01.590
Ugh, it's been more
than five minutes!

34:01.591 --> 34:04.972
Then why haven't you
gone and found her, Olivia?

34:04.973 --> 34:06.802
And Travis, can you
stop being a dick?

34:06.803 --> 34:08.976
This is fucking ridiculous!

34:08.976 --> 34:10.116
Fine.

34:10.117 --> 34:12.946
Fine, I will go get Molly.

34:12.947 --> 34:17.952
So we can all resume this
wonderfully shitty party!

34:18.710 --> 34:19.540
Thank you.

34:22.197 --> 34:25.684
Shit, this little get
together went downhill quickly.

34:26.616 --> 34:28.203
You think?

34:28.204 --> 34:29.445
I don't know why
everybody's in such

34:29.446 --> 34:30.929
fucked up moods in
the first place.

34:38.386 --> 34:39.215
Molly!

34:43.804 --> 34:45.221
Molly, where are you?

34:46.739 --> 34:47.533
Fuck.

34:52.469 --> 34:53.781
I swear to God, Molly.

34:55.438 --> 35:00.443
Come on.

35:05.551 --> 35:06.656
Come on, Molly.

35:08.899 --> 35:09.899
I'm sorry.

35:20.532 --> 35:21.360
Shit.

35:49.008 --> 35:50.837
Man, Olivia, sit down!

35:50.838 --> 35:52.321
You're making me nervous.

35:52.322 --> 35:53.495
Well, why aren't they back yet?

35:53.496 --> 35:54.979
Olivia, give them a few minutes.

35:54.980 --> 35:57.430
They probably have some issues
they need to talk through.

35:57.431 --> 35:58.948
They want to be alone.

35:58.949 --> 36:00.157
Yeah, and he was expecting them

36:00.158 --> 36:01.641
to be fighting like
four year olds.

36:01.642 --> 36:03.677
What's that supposed to mean?

36:03.678 --> 36:04.920
Nothing, I'm just.

36:04.921 --> 36:06.439
Give them some time,
Olivia, they'll be back.

36:06.440 --> 36:09.787
When they do, we
should just go home.

36:09.788 --> 36:11.514
This whole thing's been a bust.

36:27.081 --> 36:28.013
Ooh, Molly.

36:30.464 --> 36:33.190
I could show you how sorry I am.

36:33.191 --> 36:36.642
Sex in a garage, could
be interesting but...

36:40.784 --> 36:42.992
Okay.

36:51.347 --> 36:52.381
Molly, no!

37:28.522 --> 37:31.109
I hope Travis and Molly
are able to work things out.

37:31.110 --> 37:32.594
Why?

37:32.595 --> 37:35.286
Well because, they've
been together for awhile.

37:35.287 --> 37:37.737
So that doesn't mean anything.

37:37.738 --> 37:40.706
Yeah, Amy, not every couple
is meant to be together.

37:42.190 --> 37:44.399
They don't make sure they
get into the same college.

37:44.400 --> 37:47.264
I mean, isn't that kinda corny?

37:47.265 --> 37:49.127
I'm not so sure
what's corny about

37:49.128 --> 37:51.440
finding the person
you want to be with.

37:51.441 --> 37:54.236
Because, Amy,
you're 17 years old,

37:54.237 --> 37:56.997
Nelson is the first and only
boyfriend you've ever had.

37:56.998 --> 37:58.378
You don't know if he's
the right one for you.

37:58.379 --> 38:00.277
Jesus, you're
sounding like my mother.

38:00.278 --> 38:03.280
The point is you're young, Amy,

38:03.281 --> 38:05.351
we should be experiencing
a lot of different things,

38:05.352 --> 38:06.284
not playing house.

38:06.285 --> 38:07.560
Hey, now.

38:07.561 --> 38:09.493
Just because you're in
a shitty relationship,

38:09.494 --> 38:12.290
doesn't mean you have to
downplay what me and Amy have.

38:14.361 --> 38:16.155
Come on, what about
you and Andrew?

38:17.018 --> 38:18.123
What's the deal there?

38:19.642 --> 38:20.781
Didn't you just hear?

38:21.747 --> 38:24.335
She doesn't want to play house.

38:24.336 --> 38:27.062
She's going off to
college and doesn't want

38:27.063 --> 38:29.996
to be committed to me
back here in hickville.

38:29.997 --> 38:31.515
You know that's not
the reason, Andrew.

38:31.516 --> 38:32.964
That's a shame.

38:32.965 --> 38:34.932
We spent most of our
lives growing up together,

38:34.933 --> 38:37.590
sharing with each other,
depending on each other,

38:37.591 --> 38:39.592
and now that we are
ready to graduate

38:39.593 --> 38:42.837
people are just so eager
and willing just to move on.

38:44.805 --> 38:47.670
You know I think it has to
do with us wanting to grow up.

38:49.050 --> 38:49.879
Be legal.

38:52.364 --> 38:54.848
I have a feeling as
soon as reality hits us,

38:54.849 --> 38:57.023
we'd give anything to
go back to high school.

38:57.024 --> 38:57.818
Jesus, dude.

38:58.991 --> 39:00.475
Shit's getting way
too deep for me.

39:01.856 --> 39:03.616
Who wants to play some cards?

39:03.617 --> 39:05.376
Yeah, let's do it.

39:05.377 --> 39:06.240
Alright.

39:06.241 --> 39:07.274
First jack deals.

39:15.283 --> 39:16.387
I like this song.

39:16.388 --> 39:17.355
It's a good song.

39:19.460 --> 39:22.670
Oh, don't downplay it, man.

39:24.983 --> 39:25.915
Yeah.

39:27.365 --> 39:28.365
You just lied.

39:28.366 --> 39:29.745
You're totally bluffing.

39:29.746 --> 39:30.678
No, no.

39:30.679 --> 39:32.058
He has a two and a two.

39:32.059 --> 39:33.749
That's all you got.

39:33.750 --> 39:35.544
Yeah, what you gonna do now!

39:47.971 --> 39:49.109
Then stop.

39:50.388 --> 39:51.802
Anyone care to make
this more interesting?

39:51.803 --> 39:52.735
How?

39:52.735 --> 39:53.563
How?

39:53.564 --> 39:55.012
A little strip poker.

39:55.013 --> 39:55.945
Nah.

39:55.946 --> 39:57.360
That's a good joke.

39:58.603 --> 40:01.364
What are you dumb or something?

40:02.192 --> 40:03.021
No, no,

40:04.505 --> 40:06.921
but speaking about stripping,

40:08.233 --> 40:10.476
Travis and Molly
should've made up by now.

40:10.477 --> 40:12.306
I mean they've been
gone for awhile.

40:13.169 --> 40:14.549
Yeah.

40:14.550 --> 40:16.759
Do you think one of us
should go look for them?

40:17.656 --> 40:18.968
Let's finish this round.

40:20.245 --> 40:22.764
If they aren't
back then I'll go.

40:22.765 --> 40:23.731
- Alright.
- Okay.

40:25.837 --> 40:27.114
Let's see what you got.

40:28.736 --> 40:30.461
- Nothing.
- Yes!

40:30.462 --> 40:31.842
Fuck, you kidding me?

40:31.843 --> 40:33.913
Take that, losers!

40:33.914 --> 40:35.605
Oh, my god.

40:36.813 --> 40:38.814
But maybe we can
play two more hands

40:38.815 --> 40:40.092
after I go pee.

40:42.129 --> 40:43.543
Bathroom's down the hall?

40:43.544 --> 40:44.855
Yeah.

40:44.856 --> 40:46.581
Hurry up, I need to
win my pretzels back.

40:46.582 --> 40:47.859
Not gonna happen.

40:49.895 --> 40:52.208
Let's play one more
hand before she gets back.

40:54.175 --> 40:55.831
I want to win back my pretzels.

40:55.832 --> 40:57.662
I only have four or five.

40:58.594 --> 40:59.457
Five.

41:00.768 --> 41:01.562
I know!

41:02.736 --> 41:04.082
I got it though.

42:24.576 --> 42:27.683
Well I am done with
this game for sure.

42:29.754 --> 42:30.582
Why?

42:31.963 --> 42:34.723
Well we've played
for way too long

42:34.724 --> 42:36.622
and I want to play a new game.

42:36.623 --> 42:37.589
You see this the last one.

42:37.589 --> 42:38.452
Look at this.

42:38.452 --> 42:39.384
You're winning.

42:39.385 --> 42:41.558
Oh, wow, I have great cards.

42:41.559 --> 42:43.490
At least now, you still
don't want to play though.

42:43.491 --> 42:45.458
No, I don't.

42:45.459 --> 42:48.288
I know I'm so good
at this game but.

42:48.289 --> 42:50.775
Alright, so new game, right.

42:51.948 --> 42:53.501
We each get dealt one card.

42:55.365 --> 42:56.539
No looking at it though.

42:58.576 --> 43:00.887
You then place the
card on your forehead,

43:00.888 --> 43:02.095
without peeking.

43:02.096 --> 43:03.580
Okay.

43:03.581 --> 43:04.822
Then you basically
bet on whether

43:04.823 --> 43:06.859
or not you have the highest card

43:06.860 --> 43:09.240
based on what you
see from the others.

43:09.241 --> 43:10.690
Easy, right?

43:10.691 --> 43:13.591
Yeah, but wait, there's still
no sign of Travis or Molly?

43:15.178 --> 43:16.420
No.

43:16.421 --> 43:17.801
Well they have been gone awhile.

43:17.802 --> 43:20.493
Yeah, I know where
you're going with this.

43:20.494 --> 43:22.357
Alright, listen.

43:22.358 --> 43:23.841
How 'bout we take a break,

43:23.842 --> 43:26.706
Amy and I will look for them,

43:26.707 --> 43:28.225
you and Andrew just stay here
just in case they come back.

43:28.226 --> 43:30.400
Alright, man,
sounds like a plan.

43:33.334 --> 43:35.232
You coming or not?

43:35.233 --> 43:37.441
I'm not too fond of that
idea of wandering around

43:37.442 --> 43:39.512
here in the middle of
the night, but fine.

43:39.513 --> 43:41.790
Well we gotta find
Travis and Molly.

43:41.791 --> 43:43.275
Won't that make you feel better?

43:44.138 --> 43:44.967
Yeah.

43:44.967 --> 43:45.795
Alright.

43:45.795 --> 43:46.624
We'll be back.

43:47.555 --> 43:48.797
Hope you find Trav and Molly.

43:48.798 --> 43:51.766
Yeah, I just hope you
don't find them in any a

43:51.767 --> 43:53.699
interesting situations.

43:53.700 --> 43:56.495
Okay.

44:01.984 --> 44:03.501
What are you doing?

44:03.502 --> 44:05.642
Come on, babe, we haven't
had any alone time all night.

44:05.643 --> 44:07.851
And what, you think
because we are now

44:07.852 --> 44:09.923
I'm gonna immediately
jump your bones?

44:12.477 --> 44:15.410
I know I haven't been
the best boyfriend lately.

44:15.411 --> 44:16.687
I've just had a lot
on my mind, you know,

44:16.688 --> 44:19.310
with graduation
coming up and you

44:19.311 --> 44:20.968
running off to
college in August.

44:22.176 --> 44:23.626
It's just a a lot to take in.

44:27.906 --> 44:29.252
Come here, baby.

44:42.541 --> 44:43.956
Bedrooms?

44:43.957 --> 44:46.890
I'm not exactly
sure you deserve it.

44:46.891 --> 44:49.686
Besides the others
will be back soon.

44:49.687 --> 44:51.584
Well we better get moving then.

45:03.321 --> 45:04.149
Travis?

45:05.703 --> 45:06.565
Molly?

45:08.395 --> 45:10.052
Travis, Molly?

45:13.538 --> 45:15.194
God, there's seriously
no sign of them.

45:15.195 --> 45:16.023
Where could they be?

45:16.023 --> 45:16.852
I don't know.

45:19.475 --> 45:21.132
Maybe they went
down to the river.

45:22.996 --> 45:23.824
I don't know.

45:24.722 --> 45:26.378
What are you doing?

45:27.483 --> 45:28.552
Oh my god!

45:33.800 --> 45:34.662
Oh my god.

45:36.319 --> 45:37.561
Oh shit.

45:37.562 --> 45:39.666
Oh my god, babe, I'm
so fucking close.

45:45.743 --> 45:46.605
Oh my.

45:54.890 --> 45:55.753
Oh.

46:02.035 --> 46:02.863
God, baby.

46:11.009 --> 46:13.252
That's just how I
imagined tonight.

46:13.253 --> 46:14.564
What, fucking me?

46:15.876 --> 46:16.739
No.

46:17.740 --> 46:19.396
Well, yeah.

46:19.397 --> 46:21.399
But more just
getting close to you.

46:22.745 --> 46:23.884
You're sweet, Andrew.

46:25.368 --> 46:26.197
Listen.

46:27.785 --> 46:30.477
I know being apart from
each other is gonna be hard,

46:31.927 --> 46:35.068
and if I'm being honest,

46:36.517 --> 46:39.037
part of me is not sure if we
should even try once I leave.

46:40.004 --> 46:42.005
You don't even want to try?

46:42.006 --> 46:43.213
I didn't say that.

46:43.214 --> 46:45.629
It's just, I don't want to feel

46:45.630 --> 46:48.080
like we're holding
each other back.

46:48.081 --> 46:48.909
From what?

46:50.462 --> 46:53.119
Olivia, I don't want to
be with anyone but you.

46:53.120 --> 46:53.949
I swear.

46:54.950 --> 46:56.743
I'll wait for you.

46:56.744 --> 46:57.779
I'll come visit you.

46:57.780 --> 46:59.230
We can make this work.

47:00.748 --> 47:02.716
We at least have to try.

47:05.063 --> 47:05.892
We can try.

47:06.824 --> 47:07.721
We deserve to try.

47:10.620 --> 47:13.415
I promise not to be
an asshole anymore.

47:24.911 --> 47:27.188
I'm gonna go to the
bathroom and clean up.

47:27.189 --> 47:29.052
Sounds good.

47:36.819 --> 47:38.856
So, we're good, right?

47:40.029 --> 47:42.514
Yeah, we're more
than good, babe.

48:04.157 --> 48:05.848
Let's go find 'em.

48:08.092 --> 48:10.196
Should we go tell
Olivia and Andy?

48:10.197 --> 48:12.648
Nah, they're probably
enjoying some alone time.

48:25.903 --> 48:30.596
Something smells fucking
disgusting in here.

48:30.597 --> 48:31.770
What the fuck?

49:07.772 --> 49:10.015
Fuck!

49:10.016 --> 49:10.913
Olivia, are you okay in there?

49:10.914 --> 49:12.224
Yeah.

49:12.225 --> 49:14.605
Except you just scared
the shit out of me.

49:14.606 --> 49:15.848
Sorry, babe.

49:15.849 --> 49:17.263
Hey look, I'm gonna
go grab a beer

49:17.264 --> 49:19.886
and put in one of those
cheesy horror flicks, alright?

49:19.887 --> 49:22.613
Okay, I'll be
out there in a minute.

49:22.614 --> 49:23.961
Well hurry up.

50:22.916 --> 50:24.848
What's in there?

50:24.849 --> 50:26.608
Nothing really.

50:26.609 --> 50:27.851
Well it's been here a long time.

50:27.852 --> 50:29.302
It was here when we got here.

50:32.236 --> 50:34.065
Nelson, the keys
are still in it.

50:35.273 --> 50:37.378
Hmm, maybe we can
take it for a spin.

50:37.379 --> 50:39.000
Isn't that kinda strange?

50:39.001 --> 50:40.553
Obviously, whoever
this truck belongs to

50:40.554 --> 50:42.107
didn't plan on being
away for that long.

50:42.108 --> 50:43.005
So where is he?

50:44.317 --> 50:47.215
I'm pretty sure he's
around here somewhere.

50:47.216 --> 50:50.425
Like I said, maybe fishing
or maybe their truck stalled.

50:50.426 --> 50:51.737
I just don't think
it's as sinister

50:51.738 --> 50:53.014
as you're letting
your mind think it is.

50:53.015 --> 50:54.291
Then where are Travis and Molly?

50:54.292 --> 50:55.534
We've been out here forever

50:55.535 --> 50:57.777
and there's no sign
of them at all.

50:57.778 --> 50:59.089
Look, maybe they're back at

50:59.090 --> 51:00.954
the house with Andrew
and Olivia, okay?

51:03.681 --> 51:04.509
Come on.

51:05.545 --> 51:06.890
Let's go back.

51:06.891 --> 51:08.962
So you can stop worrying.

51:23.218 --> 51:25.944
Come on, you have to know
all your friends are dead!

51:42.375 --> 51:45.136
No, don't go in
there, you moron!

51:57.459 --> 51:58.839
Katie, it's me!

52:05.639 --> 52:06.468
Olivia?

52:18.204 --> 52:20.067
The hell is she doing?

52:26.039 --> 52:27.696
Olivia, are you
done yet or what?

52:34.392 --> 52:35.428
Seriously?

52:39.156 --> 52:41.330
What the hell, so now
you're taking a shower?

52:42.849 --> 52:44.333
Thanks for fucking telling me.

53:09.738 --> 53:10.670
Look, listen.

53:12.223 --> 53:14.225
I know you aren't
having the best night.

53:15.675 --> 53:17.918
I really did want this to
be an awesome night for us.

53:19.368 --> 53:21.818
It's been fine, Nelson,
it's nothing you've done.

53:21.819 --> 53:23.821
Just so dang creepy out here.

53:25.202 --> 53:26.409
And with those
missing girls I guess

53:26.410 --> 53:28.412
I'm just a little on edge.

53:30.068 --> 53:31.449
Understandable.

53:33.624 --> 53:35.728
You have nothing to worry about.

53:35.729 --> 53:36.867
You really think I
would bring you out here

53:36.868 --> 53:39.699
if I thought something
would happen?

53:44.945 --> 53:45.946
Did you hear that?

53:57.544 --> 53:59.201
There's someone
up there, Nelson.

54:02.618 --> 54:04.241
Alright look, who's out there?

54:07.105 --> 54:09.142
We're just looking
for our friends, okay?

54:12.110 --> 54:13.595
Come on, let's go!

54:15.873 --> 54:16.701
Come on!

54:21.810 --> 54:23.051
Oh shit.

54:23.052 --> 54:24.432
What the fuck!

54:24.433 --> 54:25.675
You scared the shit out of me!

54:25.676 --> 54:27.815
Why didn't you answer us
when we called to you?

54:27.816 --> 54:29.265
What?

54:29.266 --> 54:31.059
I literally just came
outside to find you guys.

54:31.060 --> 54:33.199
Wait, so you weren't
back there on the road?

54:33.200 --> 54:34.649
Fuck no, man!

54:34.650 --> 54:36.686
I don't even want to be
here right now in this dark.

54:36.687 --> 54:38.447
No way I'd wander down the road.

54:39.655 --> 54:40.966
But enough of that.

54:40.967 --> 54:43.417
Something fucking
strange is going on.

54:43.418 --> 54:45.971
What do you mean, have
Travis and Molly come back?

54:45.972 --> 54:47.628
Why aren't you wearing a shirt?

54:47.629 --> 54:49.077
See that's the thing.

54:49.078 --> 54:50.838
They haven't come back yet,

54:50.839 --> 54:53.012
and Olivia won't come
out of the bathroom.

54:53.013 --> 54:54.497
Why, what did you do to her?

54:54.498 --> 54:56.085
I didn't do shit to her, Amy!

54:57.363 --> 54:59.571
Look, she went in there
after we messed around

54:59.572 --> 55:01.227
and she hasn't come out.

55:01.228 --> 55:02.437
She won't even answer me.

55:07.580 --> 55:09.270
I think there's blood
on the kitchen floor.

55:09.271 --> 55:10.375
Wait, what?

55:10.376 --> 55:11.273
Just come on!

55:20.282 --> 55:21.318
Shit, Andrew.

55:23.320 --> 55:24.768
If this what you were watching

55:24.769 --> 55:26.392
then no wonder
you're so freaked.

55:28.842 --> 55:29.671
Andrew?

55:32.018 --> 55:33.709
This shouldn't be
playing right now.

55:35.401 --> 55:38.092
It was over when I
came to find you guys.

55:45.272 --> 55:46.825
Olivia?

55:47.896 --> 55:48.999
Are you in there?

55:54.454 --> 55:55.627
Swear to God, Andrew,

55:55.628 --> 55:56.973
if you guys are playing
some kind of joke!

55:56.974 --> 55:58.940
Get fucking real, Amy!

55:58.941 --> 56:00.839
This shit's fucked!

56:00.840 --> 56:01.806
Come on!

56:16.787 --> 56:19.997
Are you sure Olivia didn't
come out of the bathroom?

56:21.032 --> 56:22.551
No, man, not when I was here.

56:24.070 --> 56:25.416
So she's still in there.

56:27.418 --> 56:29.212
Okay, Amy, look, just
look in the drawer

56:29.213 --> 56:30.386
and see if you
can find something

56:30.387 --> 56:31.940
to pick the bathroom
door lock, okay?

56:34.805 --> 56:37.116
Andrew, what the
fuck is going on?

56:37.117 --> 56:38.395
This is insane.

56:39.775 --> 56:41.018
I don't know.

56:48.405 --> 56:49.233
Guys, come over here.

56:49.233 --> 56:50.061
Look at this.

56:52.167 --> 56:54.376
Nelson, why would your
uncle have all these?

56:57.414 --> 56:58.276
I don't know.

57:00.831 --> 57:02.383
Maybe he's just
interested, okay?

57:02.384 --> 57:04.799
You know this is big news
in a small town like this.

57:04.800 --> 57:06.283
This is all kinds
of creepy, dude.

57:06.284 --> 57:08.182
I think we should
just find the others

57:08.183 --> 57:08.977
and get out of here.

57:08.977 --> 57:09.805
Oh, shit.

57:12.808 --> 57:15.154
Okay, look let me go to the car.

57:15.155 --> 57:16.604
Alright, y'all try to
get into the bathroom

57:16.605 --> 57:17.847
and as soon as I get back we can

57:17.848 --> 57:18.848
all go look for Travis
and Molly together.

57:18.849 --> 57:20.229
I don't like this at all.

57:23.301 --> 57:24.647
You'll be with Andrew, okay.

57:24.648 --> 57:26.650
I'll be back in a flash.

57:57.059 --> 57:58.370
Uncle?

58:02.306 --> 58:03.272
No!

58:34.303 --> 58:35.132
Olivia?

58:37.997 --> 58:40.516
If you're in there, come on!

58:40.517 --> 58:41.518
Please answer us!

58:42.691 --> 58:44.450
Olivia, we need
to get outta here!

58:47.593 --> 58:49.559
Alright fuck this, stand back.

58:52.356 --> 58:53.530
What the hell?

58:55.359 --> 58:58.464
We have to get out of here!

58:58.465 --> 58:59.535
Oh, fuck!

59:13.550 --> 59:14.965
Amy, calm down.

59:16.518 --> 59:17.898
You need to hide.

59:17.899 --> 59:19.485
Nelson.

59:19.486 --> 59:21.108
We're gonna find him later.

59:21.109 --> 59:22.419
You need to.

59:24.422 --> 59:27.528
You need to go in a bedroom
and hide in a closet.

59:27.529 --> 59:28.529
- No.
- And lock the door.

59:28.530 --> 59:31.359
No, we have to get out of here!

59:31.360 --> 59:32.982
in trouble.

59:32.983 --> 59:34.155
Go!

01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:51.705
Good morning WDAR listeners!

01:05:51.706 --> 01:05:53.845
On top of it being
a beautiful day,

01:05:53.846 --> 01:05:56.054
I had the opportunity
to hang out at the

01:05:56.055 --> 01:05:58.815
Hoover High School after
prom party last night,

01:05:58.816 --> 01:06:01.992
and let me tell
you it was a blast!

01:06:03.097 --> 01:06:04.269
Check it out!

01:06:04.270 --> 01:06:05.926
Check it out.
