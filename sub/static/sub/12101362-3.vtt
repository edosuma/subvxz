WEBVTT

00:06.745 --> 00:08.791
-Dr. Sanchez, over here!
-Hang in there, sweetheart.

00:08.834 --> 00:10.532
All right, what do we got?

00:10.575 --> 00:12.664
Stab wounds to the left abdomen.
Heart rate's 40. BP's falling.

00:12.708 --> 00:14.318
Okay, we got to get in there
and control the blood loss.

00:14.362 --> 00:16.146
Take her straight up
to the O.R.

00:16.190 --> 00:18.496
-Okay.
-Hold it.
You're not going

00:18.540 --> 00:19.541
anywhere near my daughter.

00:19.584 --> 00:20.716
-No, no, no,
-Anders,

00:20.759 --> 00:22.326
Fallon said Evan Tate did it,
not Adam.

00:22.370 --> 00:24.111
He had nothing
-to do with it.
-Please,

00:24.154 --> 00:25.634
I'm a surgeon.
I can help, for God's sake.

00:25.677 --> 00:28.898
Like you helped your mother?
No, thank you.

00:28.941 --> 00:31.031
Okay, I'm not sure
what is going on here,

00:31.074 --> 00:32.423
but Kirby is all that
matters right now.

00:32.467 --> 00:35.209
Please let him go, so
he can keep us updated.

00:36.732 --> 00:39.126
Can we get some help here?

00:39.169 --> 00:41.084
Fallon, are you all right?

00:41.128 --> 00:42.477
I tried to stop him.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.653
Dad, I'm fine, I'm fine.
I'm just worried about you.

00:44.696 --> 00:46.481
Just try to relax.

00:46.524 --> 00:48.570
-I can't feel my legs.
-You...

00:50.398 --> 00:53.053
Why would Evan just
show up at the theater

00:53.096 --> 00:54.489
and try to kill you?

00:54.532 --> 00:56.708
Oh, I don't know.
I forgot to ask him,

00:56.752 --> 00:58.536
what with the knife
at my throat.

00:58.580 --> 01:00.234
-Blake got there just in
time for us to stop him,

01:00.277 --> 01:01.539
then they both took
a bad fall.

01:01.583 --> 01:02.453
What is the latest on Kirby?

01:02.497 --> 01:03.628
Is she gonna be okay?

01:03.672 --> 01:05.326
Well, Adam's with her
in the O.R.

01:05.369 --> 01:07.110
It might take a while.

01:07.154 --> 01:10.113
Hey, You should sit down.
You're upset.

01:10.157 --> 01:11.854
Upset? No.

01:11.897 --> 01:13.856
No. Why would I be upset?

01:13.899 --> 01:15.771
I mean, this is the...
kind of wedding day

01:15.814 --> 01:17.077
every little
girl dreams of,

01:17.120 --> 01:18.600
one that starts
with a twisted ankle

01:18.643 --> 01:20.384
and ends with a
knife at her throat,

01:20.428 --> 01:22.125
and it's what fairy tales
are made of.

01:22.169 --> 01:23.735
Somebody should call Disney.

01:26.608 --> 01:28.523
Hey.

01:28.566 --> 01:30.046
-You okay?
-Of course.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.048
Okay?
I just don't like clumsy nurses.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.094
Yes, yes,
I'm talking about you.

01:35.878 --> 01:37.314
Look, you've been through
a serious trauma.

01:37.358 --> 01:39.751
Maybe you should see a doctor.
Talk to someone?

01:39.795 --> 01:41.884
No, I'm fine, Liam, I promise.

01:41.927 --> 01:44.104
Blake and Kirby are the ones
I'm worried about,

01:44.147 --> 01:45.670
because this is all my fault.

01:51.154 --> 01:52.286
They both got attacked?

01:52.329 --> 01:53.200
Adam said neither of them
sustained

01:53.243 --> 01:55.027
life-threatening injuries,

01:55.071 --> 01:57.029
but that was all
he could say for now.

01:57.073 --> 01:59.597
Well, I hope they're okay.
Well, Kirby anyway.

01:59.641 --> 02:02.600
Wouldn't shed a tear if Blake
was knocking on death's door.

02:02.644 --> 02:04.254
I suppose he's been hurt
enough,

02:04.298 --> 02:07.214
considering we managed
to take everything he owns.

02:07.257 --> 02:08.954
Certainly the highlight
of my day.

02:08.998 --> 02:12.871
Mm. Mine was becoming the
new owner of Carrington Manor.

02:14.395 --> 02:18.181
Well, I just, uh,
came by to get a few things.

02:18.225 --> 02:20.662
I'll send movers
to get the rest.

02:20.705 --> 02:22.011
And I'm meeting
with my lawyer tomorrow

02:22.054 --> 02:23.186
to review the divorce
settlement.

02:23.230 --> 02:24.796
He'll send it to you to sign,

02:24.840 --> 02:26.189
and I-I guess that's it.

02:26.233 --> 02:28.191
You make it sound so final.

02:28.235 --> 02:30.237
It's not that last
you'll see of me, Mr. Colby.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.500
After all, we are partners

02:32.543 --> 02:34.676
in a new diamond mine now,
remember?

02:34.719 --> 02:37.331
How could I forget?

02:37.374 --> 02:39.115
So, uh, where's that contract?

02:39.159 --> 02:42.031
Oh, you know lawyers.
They take forever.

02:42.074 --> 02:43.250
But they're working on it.

02:43.293 --> 02:45.208
And in the meantime,
I am meeting with

02:45.252 --> 02:48.951
a foreman tomorrow so we can
start the excavation.

02:48.994 --> 02:51.083
Thanks, Alexis.

02:51.127 --> 02:52.607
Not just for the investment,

02:52.650 --> 02:54.913
but for keeping things chill
in the divorce.

02:54.957 --> 02:56.219
Mm.

02:56.263 --> 02:57.394
It means a lot.

03:01.006 --> 03:02.530
Dr. Coleman, dial 133.

03:02.573 --> 03:03.879
How's she doing?

03:03.922 --> 03:05.837
Oh, no news.
It's interminable.

03:05.881 --> 03:08.100
Well, I'm sure they're doing
the best they can.

03:08.144 --> 03:10.581
And don't worry,
I went to the loft

03:10.625 --> 03:12.235
and spoke to Shelly Duncan.

03:12.279 --> 03:14.237
She was freaked out, but I
got her out of there unnoticed.

03:14.281 --> 03:15.499
Did you tell her
I'll be in touch?

03:15.543 --> 03:17.414
I did, but she said
don't bother.

03:17.458 --> 03:20.678
She's going back to Montana
and changing her number.

03:20.722 --> 03:22.898
Who is she, anyway?

03:23.899 --> 03:25.814
Is Kirby okay?

03:25.857 --> 03:27.119
Are you gonna have to push
Blake around in a wheelchair

03:27.163 --> 03:28.512
for the rest of his life?

03:28.556 --> 03:31.036
They're both gonna be fine.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.560
Oh, thank God.

03:32.603 --> 03:34.301
Father has severe inflammation
of the spine,

03:34.344 --> 03:36.607
causing temporary paralysis,
but with therapy and time,

03:36.651 --> 03:38.130
he'll walk again.

03:38.174 --> 03:39.567
He's demanding to be discharged.

03:39.610 --> 03:41.743
What about Kirby?

03:41.786 --> 03:44.659
She's in a lot of pain, but no
vital organs were damaged.

03:44.702 --> 03:46.530
You can go see her now
if you want.

03:46.574 --> 03:51.187
Just know that we both
-want what's best for Kirby.
-Do we?

03:51.231 --> 03:52.710
I meant what I said earlier.

03:52.754 --> 03:54.234
Stay away from my daughter.

03:56.410 --> 03:57.672
Where is Evan Tate?

03:57.715 --> 03:59.239
Is he here?
Because if he is,

03:59.282 --> 04:01.241
and you're looking for someone
to pull the plug,

04:01.284 --> 04:02.981
I will happily volunteer.

04:03.025 --> 04:04.461
He's been treated
for minor injuries

04:04.505 --> 04:05.636
and released into police
custody.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.943
He just wouldn't stop ranting

04:07.986 --> 04:09.597
on and on about how
the Carringtons

04:09.640 --> 04:11.338
need to pay for their sins.

04:11.381 --> 04:12.774
He's consistent,
I'll give him that.

04:12.817 --> 04:15.167
Well, hopefully this whole
nightmare's over.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.217
Oh.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.524
Finally.

04:23.567 --> 04:25.308
You certainly were
at Jeff's a long time.

04:25.352 --> 04:27.092
Were you trying to convince him
to remarry you already?

04:27.136 --> 04:30.574
Oh, Dominique, jealousy
is such an ugly color on you,

04:30.618 --> 04:33.360
and green isn't so hot either.

04:33.403 --> 04:35.100
I was worried.

04:35.144 --> 04:37.277
Jeff isn't exactly
fond off me right now.

04:37.320 --> 04:38.843
If he found out I was
involved in the diamond mine,

04:38.887 --> 04:40.192
he'd shut us down.

04:40.236 --> 04:42.499
Relax, he has no idea.

04:42.543 --> 04:44.545
And we need
to keep it that way until he

04:44.588 --> 04:46.286
finances the dig.
I can't afford it

04:46.329 --> 04:48.679
on my own with what
I'm getting in the divorce.

04:48.723 --> 04:50.420
And what happens
when he finds out

04:50.464 --> 04:53.510
he's only getting a third
of the profits instead of half?

04:53.554 --> 04:56.078
I told my attorney to
take his time with the contract.

04:56.121 --> 04:58.167
We'll be pulling diamonds
out of the ground

04:58.210 --> 04:59.690
long before Jeff
sees any paperwork.

04:59.734 --> 05:02.345
And by then, he'll be
so blinded with bling

05:02.389 --> 05:03.694
he won't care.

05:03.738 --> 05:05.957
You certainly
have it all planned out.

05:06.001 --> 05:08.786
I forgot how deceitful
you can be.

05:08.830 --> 05:12.137
Speaking of plans, I'm having
a small press event tomorrow

05:12.181 --> 05:15.358
to introduce my new diamond
empire to the world.

05:15.402 --> 05:17.360
I do love a good
groundbreaking ceremony.

05:17.404 --> 05:20.842
<i>Your</i> diamond empire?

05:20.885 --> 05:22.757
The last I checked,

05:22.800 --> 05:24.454
I control the mineral rights.

05:24.498 --> 05:26.543
I'll shut this whole thing down

05:26.587 --> 05:28.153
before I allow you
to steal the spotlight.

05:41.036 --> 05:44.387
Mm. Chilled
to perfection.

05:44.431 --> 05:46.084
Thank you.

05:47.869 --> 05:49.479
Is there anything else,
Mrs. Colby?

05:49.523 --> 05:51.263
Yes. Could you get me
some extra olives?

05:51.307 --> 05:54.963
Oh, and then pack your bags.
You're fired.

05:55.006 --> 05:57.748
Be a dove and tell the rest
of Blake's personal staff

05:57.792 --> 06:00.447
that they have met
the same fate.

06:00.490 --> 06:02.753
Night-night.

06:07.976 --> 06:10.631
Well, I see it
hasn't taken long

06:10.674 --> 06:12.937
for the wicked queen to
settle into her castle.

06:12.981 --> 06:16.767
Wicked? Need I remind you
I was the original queen here?

06:16.811 --> 06:20.205
That is, until Blake banished me
from the kingdom.

06:20.249 --> 06:21.250
Oh, speaking of Blake,
he suffered

06:21.293 --> 06:23.295
a horrific attack earlier.

06:23.339 --> 06:24.514
I spoke with Adam,
and he told me...

06:24.558 --> 06:26.516
I meant your attack, mother.

06:26.560 --> 06:29.432
Stealing his home, his company

06:29.476 --> 06:31.782
and all of his money
on my wedding day.

06:31.826 --> 06:35.960
Yes, well, while the timing
is not ideal,

06:36.004 --> 06:39.137
I am not sorry
for kicking him out.

06:39.181 --> 06:42.837
Fallon, please. I'm sorry
if I ruined your wedding.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.622
What can I do to
-make it up to you?
-Hmm.

06:45.666 --> 06:47.842
I am so glad you asked.

06:52.977 --> 06:54.718
Hello, Alexis.

06:54.762 --> 06:56.372
You look as haggard as ever.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.418
What the hell is he doing here?

06:58.461 --> 07:00.332
You want to make it up to me?

07:00.376 --> 07:03.379
Then Blake stays here
while he recovers.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.468
And I'm gonna take care of him.

07:05.512 --> 07:07.470
Why do you have to
-take care of him?
-Because

07:07.514 --> 07:09.037
I am the reason
he got hurt.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.342
I'm the one who
brought Evan

07:10.386 --> 07:11.822
into our lives.
It's only right that

07:11.866 --> 07:12.910
I'm the one who nurses
him back to health.

07:12.954 --> 07:14.042
And that happens here.

07:14.085 --> 07:16.871
How long will that be, exactly?

07:16.914 --> 07:18.873
As long as it takes.

07:18.916 --> 07:20.527
I am not going anywhere

07:20.570 --> 07:22.833
until things are back to normal.

07:22.877 --> 07:26.446
Yes, I will work 24/7
doing whatever I have to do

07:26.489 --> 07:28.796
to get Blake better.
That's right, world.

07:28.839 --> 07:33.453
Fallon Nightingale
has arrived. Mm.

07:33.496 --> 07:34.845
Uh,

07:34.889 --> 07:37.761
where do we keep
the aspirin?

08:02.046 --> 08:03.700
Good morning!

08:03.744 --> 08:06.921
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Don't get up. I'll help you.

08:08.618 --> 08:10.054
-Good morning, sweetheart.
-I have your coffee.

08:10.098 --> 08:12.404
And breakfast
will be ready soon.

08:12.448 --> 08:16.365
Here we go.
Okay...

08:18.585 --> 08:20.761
This is very sweet of you,
but don't you think that

08:20.804 --> 08:22.893
we should hire an actual nurse?

08:22.937 --> 08:25.635
It's the least I could do
after you saved my life.

08:25.679 --> 08:29.421
I also ruined your wedding day
fighting with Alexis.

08:29.465 --> 08:31.772
I'm... I'm so sorry.

08:31.815 --> 08:34.383
I don't blame you.
I blame her.

08:34.426 --> 08:36.124
I didn't realize that
she had conned you

08:36.167 --> 08:37.212
out of everything you own.

08:37.255 --> 08:39.562
Has anyone heard from Cristal?

08:39.606 --> 08:41.738
Isn't she your wife?

08:41.782 --> 08:45.350
Well, technically, but she's
not answering my calls.

08:45.394 --> 08:47.483
We had a big fight
before the wedding,

08:47.527 --> 08:48.528
and she stormed out.

08:48.571 --> 08:50.094
Let me guess, you decided to

08:50.138 --> 08:51.922
go for a second spin
on my mother-in-law?

08:51.966 --> 08:53.794
That's in the past,

08:53.837 --> 08:55.883
And so is Cristal's fling
with that priest.

08:55.926 --> 08:57.754
It doesn't matter what we were
fighting about, I love her.

08:57.798 --> 08:59.887
And I may have lost
everything else,

08:59.930 --> 09:02.846
But I know that my marriage
can still work.

09:02.890 --> 09:04.108
Does she know that?

09:04.152 --> 09:06.110
She will.
I just need to see her.

09:06.154 --> 09:09.244
I'm gonna admit all my mistakes,
I'm gonna promise no more lies.

09:09.287 --> 09:11.507
Blake 2.0.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.597
I'm pretty sure
you're up to 4.0

09:14.641 --> 09:16.773
Would you go to La Mirage
and talk to her for me?

09:16.817 --> 09:18.775
Get her to come here.

09:18.819 --> 09:20.864
That's gonna be a hard pass.

09:20.908 --> 09:22.474
I'm not getting
in the middle of your marriage,

09:22.518 --> 09:25.042
but I'm sure Cristal
will come to her senses

09:25.086 --> 09:27.958
and call soon enough.
Okay?

09:33.268 --> 09:35.792
Leaving so soon?

09:35.836 --> 09:37.620
I was hoping the night
wouldn't have to end.

09:37.664 --> 09:40.057
Uh, I, uh...

09:40.101 --> 09:42.190
should probably get to work.

09:42.233 --> 09:44.496
-Is everything okay?
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

09:44.540 --> 09:47.238
Being with you like this again--
it feels great.

09:47.282 --> 09:51.155
It's just breaking my oath
to God, that's...

09:51.199 --> 09:52.722
not so great.

09:52.766 --> 09:56.465
I've put you in an
uncomfortable position.

09:56.508 --> 09:57.597
I'm sorry.

09:57.640 --> 09:58.946
No, you don't have to be sorry.

09:58.989 --> 10:00.861
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.

10:00.904 --> 10:03.646
So if you feel the same way,
I mean, if this is real,

10:03.690 --> 10:05.169
then I'll just leave the church.

10:05.213 --> 10:07.258
Of course I feel the same way.

10:07.302 --> 10:09.783
Look, I am not trying
-to pressure you.
-You're not.

10:09.826 --> 10:13.090
I'll talk to him soon.
I promise.

10:13.134 --> 10:15.527
I just need to find
the right time.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.947
Wow. Hey.

10:43.991 --> 10:45.732
Hi.

10:45.775 --> 10:48.517
Look at you,
wearing an apron.

10:49.997 --> 10:53.653
Fun. Say, uh,
-where's the staff?
-Oh.

10:53.696 --> 10:56.220
My egomaniacal mother
went on a firing spree

10:56.264 --> 10:58.570
so she can bring in
her own beaten-down robots.

10:58.614 --> 11:00.877
And when will those
robots be arriving?

11:00.921 --> 11:02.531
I mean, you look like
you've got things covered,

11:02.574 --> 11:04.228
but never hurts to
have some help, right?

11:04.272 --> 11:05.882
Please, Liam.

11:05.926 --> 11:07.841
I think I'm capable
of making a simple breakfast.

11:07.884 --> 11:10.844
Yes, I-I... I see that, but
it's a lot more than that.

11:10.887 --> 11:13.324
I mean, caring for a bedridden
person is a big job, Fallon.

11:13.368 --> 11:15.457
So are you saying
I can't do it?

11:15.500 --> 11:17.807
No, of course not.
Just feels like

11:17.851 --> 11:19.722
bringing in a nurse to
help Blake can't hurt.

11:19.766 --> 11:24.074
Plus, that way, you and I can
go get some lunch or something.

11:24.118 --> 11:26.860
It's feeling a little
claustrophobic around here.

11:26.903 --> 11:31.081
You can't feel claustrophobic
in a house with 17 bathrooms.

11:31.125 --> 11:33.344
-Ow!
-And I can't leave.

11:33.388 --> 11:34.824
I am not letting
a perfect stranger

11:34.868 --> 11:36.783
tend to Blake when I should be
doing it myself.

11:36.826 --> 11:37.958
Yeah, but Fallon... Don't worry.

11:38.001 --> 11:40.395
I've got everything
under control.

11:42.223 --> 11:43.964
♪ Now, watch us work it

12:10.468 --> 12:12.253

-Ah.
-How about lunch?

12:14.342 --> 12:15.996
Oh, that sounds great.

12:16.039 --> 12:17.780
Can you just whip me up
something simple,

12:17.824 --> 12:19.739
like a spinach and red pepper
frittata with truffle cheese?

12:19.782 --> 12:22.393
No, I mean, let's go out.

12:22.437 --> 12:23.699
Blake will survive for an hour.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.309
Well, you don't know that.

12:25.353 --> 12:27.790
I mean, he's improving
by the minute with me here,

12:27.834 --> 12:29.270
so, you know, why chance it?

12:29.313 --> 12:32.012
Okay, but you do remember

12:32.055 --> 12:34.579
that we're leaving for our
honeymoon tomorrow, right?

12:34.623 --> 12:38.279
Right. That.
You know, it's just that

12:38.322 --> 12:40.803
it's kind of
touch and go with him... Okay, but you just said

12:40.847 --> 12:42.936
-he was improving.
-Okay, well,
I'm not a doctor, Liam.

12:42.979 --> 12:46.113
-Come on.
-You see? Kirby needs me, too.

12:46.156 --> 12:48.898
Fallon, I'm sure
between Adam And Anders,

12:48.942 --> 12:50.639
they can take care
of her a little bit.

12:50.682 --> 12:53.773
Liam, just like Blake, she could
have died because of me.

12:53.816 --> 12:55.252
Okay? And Anders,
would you please move?

12:55.296 --> 12:56.950
-Okay? You're doing it wrong.
-Doing what wrong?

12:56.993 --> 12:58.429
Exactly.

12:58.473 --> 12:59.779
Here we go.

13:06.089 --> 13:07.569
I suppose if the back lawn
is the best entry point

13:07.612 --> 13:08.962
for the mine, I'll
have my ceremony there.

13:09.005 --> 13:10.964
Midafternoon should be nice.

13:11.007 --> 13:13.836
My eyes really pop
with an overhead sun.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.490
Alexis.

13:15.533 --> 13:17.318
Oh, excuse me just a moment.
Jeff.

13:17.361 --> 13:19.799
I'm afraid you're a day early
for the groundbreaking ceremony.

13:19.842 --> 13:22.889
Yeah, about that.
I just spoke to my lawyer.

13:22.932 --> 13:25.892
He said your lawyer told
him the diamond profits

13:25.935 --> 13:28.024
will be split three ways?

13:28.068 --> 13:31.114
-What gives?
-Yes. Well...

13:31.158 --> 13:35.292
that is because
my cousin, Bob--

13:35.336 --> 13:36.990
he gets a third.

13:37.033 --> 13:39.296
He was left half
of the mineral rights with me.

13:39.340 --> 13:43.735
-Your cousin?
-Yes, he lives
a few hours from here.

13:43.779 --> 13:45.259
Haven't seen him in years,

13:45.302 --> 13:47.130
but his attorney said
that he doesn't have the time

13:47.174 --> 13:48.828
or the capital to invest,

13:48.871 --> 13:52.309
so he generously
agreed to just 33%.

13:52.353 --> 13:54.572
You didn't think that's
something I should know about?

13:54.616 --> 13:57.097
I didn't want to bother you
with the details.

13:57.140 --> 13:58.576
I know how busy you are.

13:58.620 --> 13:59.969
Still, I need to meet this guy,

14:00.013 --> 14:01.884
so, let's all do
dinner tonight.

14:01.928 --> 14:04.234
No. His attorney said
that Bob actually prefers

14:04.278 --> 14:06.323
to be a silent partner.

14:06.367 --> 14:07.759
Mm, that's great, but I
won't go into business

14:07.803 --> 14:09.413
with someone I don't know.

14:09.457 --> 14:11.763
What if this guy tries to
screw us over down the road?

14:11.807 --> 14:13.722
He wouldn't do that.
He's family.

14:13.765 --> 14:17.160
When money's involved,
family means nothing.

14:17.204 --> 14:19.728
I want to make sure
we're protected.

14:19.771 --> 14:21.251
Set it up, okay?

14:21.295 --> 14:22.992
<i>I thought</i>

14:23.036 --> 14:24.994
-I made myself clear earlier.
-I was just making sure

14:25.038 --> 14:26.256
that Kirby's comfortable.

14:26.300 --> 14:27.910
I can do that.
You're not needed here.

14:27.954 --> 14:29.694
Adam, it's okay.

14:29.738 --> 14:31.044
Go to work.

14:31.087 --> 14:32.306
I want to talk to my dad

14:32.349 --> 14:33.524
alone, anyway.

14:38.181 --> 14:41.489
He is dangerous, Kirby.
I'm gonna prove it to you.

14:41.532 --> 14:43.534
I don't need your proof.

14:43.578 --> 14:44.884
If this is about
Adam's adoptive mom,

14:44.927 --> 14:46.233
he told me what happened,

14:46.276 --> 14:47.669
-and I'm not worried.
-Really?

14:47.712 --> 14:49.149
Did he mention
that he was responsible

14:49.192 --> 14:50.890
for his mother's death?

14:50.933 --> 14:53.718
He was hurt, and maybe
he had good reason to be.

14:53.762 --> 14:55.242
But he's not proud
of what he did,

14:55.285 --> 14:56.939
and if he could go back
and change it, he would.

14:56.983 --> 14:58.462
That's rather convenient,
don't you think?

14:58.506 --> 15:01.770
Look, sometimes
good people do bad things.

15:01.813 --> 15:05.252
You're a shining
-example of that.
-I beg your pardon?

15:05.295 --> 15:06.993
You chose the Carringtons
over your own daughter.

15:07.036 --> 15:08.646
You sent me back

15:08.690 --> 15:10.039
to Australia when I was ten

15:10.083 --> 15:11.606
to live with
a heroin-addicted mother.

15:11.649 --> 15:13.521
You know that
that was not my decision.

15:13.564 --> 15:15.915
What I know is that
Adam saved my life

15:15.958 --> 15:17.786
24 hours ago.

15:17.829 --> 15:19.614
He loves me.

15:19.657 --> 15:21.659
And so do I.

15:21.703 --> 15:23.270
Which is why
I'm trying to protect you.

15:24.271 --> 15:26.142
I don't need your protection.

15:26.186 --> 15:28.405
And if you don't drop
this crusade against Adam,

15:28.449 --> 15:30.190
you can consider me out
of your life for good.

15:34.890 --> 15:39.547
Hey. Brought you some smiley
face stickers and some licorice.

15:39.590 --> 15:42.376
Turns out there aren't
any cards that say,

15:42.419 --> 15:45.031
"Get well soon and sorry
you lost everything you own."

15:45.074 --> 15:46.946
Yes, well, I can see

15:46.989 --> 15:49.035
why a person wouldn't want
to be reminded of that.

15:49.078 --> 15:51.428
Right. Sorry.

15:51.472 --> 15:54.214
Look, you've been very
generous to me in the past.

15:54.257 --> 15:57.260
You could have kicked me
to the curb more than once,

15:57.304 --> 15:59.001
but you didn't.
My point is,

15:59.045 --> 16:00.742
you were there for me
when I needed help,

16:00.785 --> 16:02.439
and now I want
to be there for you.

16:02.483 --> 16:04.311
Well, do you have
a couple extra billion

16:04.354 --> 16:05.660
laying around
you want to part with?

16:05.703 --> 16:07.662
Not quite.

16:07.705 --> 16:10.404
But whenever you need it,

16:10.447 --> 16:12.580
there's a suite waiting
for you at La Mirage.

16:12.623 --> 16:14.843
Comped.

16:14.886 --> 16:18.499
That's very kind of you, and I
might take you up on that offer.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.284
You know, right now,
I have another favor to ask you.

16:21.328 --> 16:22.764
I need to see Cristal.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.159
Would you talk to her,
get her to come visit me?

16:26.202 --> 16:27.812
Well, you know Cristal.

16:27.856 --> 16:29.510
She doesn't do anything
she doesn't want to do.

16:29.553 --> 16:33.340
Please?
She's all I have left.

16:34.732 --> 16:36.691
And you're my best shot.

16:36.734 --> 16:38.823
Well, I do have a way
with words.

16:39.955 --> 16:41.261
Okay, fine,

16:41.304 --> 16:43.611
but I can't make
-any promises.
-Yeah.

16:43.654 --> 16:47.615
Would you like a piece of your,
um, favorite black licorice?

16:47.658 --> 16:49.138
-God, yes.
-As a thank-you?

16:49.182 --> 16:51.184
I'm keeping these.

16:51.227 --> 16:54.143
How many years has this land
been in the Morell family?

16:54.187 --> 16:56.754
In the early 1900s,
our grandfather...

16:56.798 --> 16:59.670
No, wait. Our great grandfather
bought the land with the intent

16:59.714 --> 17:00.976
to expand his corn farm.

17:01.020 --> 17:01.977
Rice farm.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.239
What happened to the corn?

17:03.283 --> 17:04.371
There never was any corn.

17:04.414 --> 17:06.808
Alexis, you can't cram 100 years

17:06.851 --> 17:09.071
of Morell hick history
into an hour.

17:09.115 --> 17:10.899
Why on earth would
you tell Jeff

17:10.942 --> 17:12.074
this ridiculous story?

17:12.118 --> 17:13.815
He's not stupid.

17:13.858 --> 17:15.295
He wasn't supposed to know
about the third partner yet.

17:15.338 --> 17:16.818
I panicked, okay?

17:16.861 --> 17:18.211
You'd think a lifetime of lying

17:18.254 --> 17:19.951
would have prepared you better.

17:19.995 --> 17:21.518
I guess I'm not the natural
that you are.

17:21.562 --> 17:23.999
Look, Dave is a trained actor.

17:24.043 --> 17:27.437
We simply have to convince Jeff
that he's an honest guy.

17:27.481 --> 17:29.613
You should call me Bob.
It'll help me stay in character.

17:29.657 --> 17:31.572
See? Training.

17:31.615 --> 17:34.401
And what happens when
Jeff looks him up?

17:34.444 --> 17:37.099
There are 42 R. Morells
in the state of Georgia.

17:37.143 --> 17:38.970
He is not gonna take the time
to track them all down.

17:39.014 --> 17:40.581
Don't underestimate my son!

17:40.624 --> 17:42.365
He's suspicious by nature.

17:42.409 --> 17:45.281
he is suspicious of <i>you,</i>

17:45.325 --> 17:46.717
with good reason.

17:46.761 --> 17:48.328
But I have done nothing

17:48.371 --> 17:50.025
but give him the best year
of his life.

17:50.069 --> 17:53.811
He's going to believe
this man is my cousin.

17:53.855 --> 17:56.249
I was thinking
nephew might play better?

18:00.818 --> 18:03.125
If hydrated skin
and tightened pores

18:03.169 --> 18:06.259
don't make you feel better,
then nothing will.

18:06.302 --> 18:07.521
It's a vacation for your face.

18:07.564 --> 18:09.218
Speaking of vacation,

18:09.262 --> 18:11.394
aren't you going on
your honeymoon tomorrow?

18:11.438 --> 18:12.917
Don't worry.
I'm not going anywhere

18:12.961 --> 18:15.050
until you and Blake are back

18:15.094 --> 18:17.400
to your old flawed
yet familiar selves.

18:17.444 --> 18:20.186
-Just enjoy the mask.
-Well, I appreciate this, Fallon,

18:20.229 --> 18:22.884
but all this clingy-friendship
stuff isn't necessary.

18:22.927 --> 18:24.146
I'm fine,

18:24.190 --> 18:25.713
and if I need medical help,

18:25.756 --> 18:27.932
I'll just call Adam.
He is a doctor.

18:27.976 --> 18:29.891
Adam?
I wouldn't trust Dr. Jekyll

18:29.934 --> 18:32.415
to change the Band-Aid
on a papercut.

18:32.459 --> 18:34.025
No offense.
I know he's your boyfriend.

18:34.069 --> 18:37.725
And I want to be here
for you, Kirby. I need to.

18:37.768 --> 18:41.250
Oh, that's Blake.

18:41.294 --> 18:43.687
Hold that thought.
I'll be right back.

18:43.731 --> 18:45.254
What's going on?

18:45.298 --> 18:47.430
The pain is getting worse,
and now I've got chills.

18:47.474 --> 18:49.476
Are you sure you
-gave me the right meds?
-Of course.

18:49.519 --> 18:52.348
I gave you one pill
at 2:00 p.m.

18:52.392 --> 18:55.830
Or was it supposed
to be two pills at 1:00 p.m.?

18:55.873 --> 18:58.311
Well, maybe just take another,
you know, to be safe?

18:58.354 --> 19:00.704
Never mind. Just get me
my wheelchair. Maybe if I sit

19:00.748 --> 19:02.141
by the fireplace,
-I'll feel better.
-Okay.

19:02.184 --> 19:05.361
Hmm.

19:05.405 --> 19:08.582
Yeah. <i>Now</i> the caps come off
easily.

19:08.625 --> 19:11.280
-Childproof my ass.
-I need my reading glasses.

19:11.324 --> 19:13.195
Uh... And some hot tea
would be nice.

19:13.239 --> 19:15.806
Okay, so, uh,
you want your Wheelchair,

19:15.850 --> 19:19.245
reading glasses and a hot tea.
I got it.

19:19.288 --> 19:21.769
Oh, okay. I just need
to check on Kirby. Okay?

19:21.812 --> 19:23.205
Be right back.

19:23.249 --> 19:24.337
Can you get me some
of that mocha chip

19:24.380 --> 19:26.252
ice cream that's in the freezer?

19:26.295 --> 19:28.428
-No problem.
-Oh, better yet. Why don't
you put it in a blender?

19:28.471 --> 19:31.387
-I love a milkshake.
-One milkshake coming up.

19:31.431 --> 19:33.607
And my skin's feeling
a little warm.

19:33.650 --> 19:35.130
Maybe it's time
to take this off?

19:35.174 --> 19:37.872
-Warm? Oh.
-Yeah, tingling.

19:40.396 --> 19:42.790
Ow! Ow! What are you doing?

19:42.833 --> 19:44.226
Are you trying to
peel off my face?

19:44.270 --> 19:46.315
No. No, no, no, no, no.
Maybe I just didn't

19:46.359 --> 19:50.450
read the directions carefully
enough, you know, or at all.

19:50.493 --> 19:51.886
Do we still have the box?

19:51.929 --> 19:54.671
Don't move.

19:54.715 --> 19:56.238
Oh, my God,
what happened?

19:56.282 --> 19:57.544
I need my wheelchair.
That's what happened.

19:57.587 --> 19:59.328
Okay, well, here,
let me help you.

19:59.372 --> 20:00.982
Okay. Oh. Oh.

20:01.025 --> 20:02.679
For the love of God,
I'll do it myself!

20:02.723 --> 20:06.248
-Okay.
-Legs?

20:09.033 --> 20:10.687
Fallon, I appreciate you trying,

20:10.731 --> 20:12.602
but I think it's time
for a real nurse.

20:12.646 --> 20:15.649
-What do you mean?
-I mean, if you don't
stop taking care of me,

20:15.692 --> 20:18.478
I'm gonna end up back
in the hospital. You're fired.

20:19.696 --> 20:21.481
Oh, my God,
what the hell happened to her?

20:22.830 --> 20:25.702
Look what you did to my face.

20:25.746 --> 20:28.009
I look like an overripe tomato!

20:28.052 --> 20:30.098
Let me guess-- I'm fired?

20:30.141 --> 20:31.534
Yes.

20:31.578 --> 20:34.581
But I still
want my milkshake first.

20:41.414 --> 20:42.937
Wow. Look at those two.

20:42.980 --> 20:45.200
You know, are they nurses
or yoga sluts, am I right?

20:45.244 --> 20:47.376
I doubt we'll hear
Blake complain.

20:47.420 --> 20:48.986
Oh. Taking care of Blake

20:49.030 --> 20:52.076
and Kirby was the only way
to absolve myself of guilt.

20:52.120 --> 20:54.122
I mean, what am I supposed
to do now?

20:54.165 --> 20:56.298
Go to confession?
I'm not even Catholic,

20:56.342 --> 20:57.734
and I don't have that kind
of time anyway.

20:57.778 --> 20:59.954
You have nothing
to feel guilty about.

20:59.997 --> 21:02.870
Now we can get some
well-deserved R & R

21:02.913 --> 21:04.524
in a little place
called Bora Bora.

21:06.003 --> 21:07.614
I just don't know.

21:07.657 --> 21:09.964
Okay,
what am I missing here?

21:10.007 --> 21:12.619
You can stay and be miserable,

21:12.662 --> 21:14.795
or you can come with me

21:14.838 --> 21:17.798
and get sand in places
you didn't think possible.

21:19.147 --> 21:21.280
Fallon, you need to
get out of this house.

21:24.500 --> 21:25.936
Well,

21:25.980 --> 21:27.677
I have been looking
for an excuse

21:27.721 --> 21:29.592
to update my
South Pacific beachwear.

21:29.636 --> 21:31.420
I guess I could run out tonight

21:31.464 --> 21:32.639
and pick up a couple things.

21:32.682 --> 21:34.249
That's my girl.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.816
Wife.

21:35.859 --> 21:37.339
-Woman.
-Mm.

21:37.383 --> 21:38.645
I'll leave?

21:38.688 --> 21:40.037
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay.

21:46.566 --> 21:49.308
Cristal, where have you been?

21:49.351 --> 21:50.613
You missed all the drama
at the wedding.

21:50.657 --> 21:52.093
And I'm not talking
nighttime soap.

21:52.136 --> 21:55.270
This was total daytime insanity.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.663
I talked to Fallon.

21:56.706 --> 21:57.881
I heard about Blake.

21:57.925 --> 21:59.448
I'm glad he's
gonna be okay.

21:59.492 --> 22:01.102
Well, physically, probably,

22:01.145 --> 22:02.930
but, mentally,
he's still on shaky ground.

22:03.974 --> 22:06.455
Actually, a visit
from you would mean a lot.

22:06.499 --> 22:08.414
I... I don't think
it's a good idea, Sam.

22:08.457 --> 22:11.852
Look, I know you guys have
been having some marital issues.

22:11.895 --> 22:15.203
I think
we're way past marital issues

22:15.246 --> 22:16.378
at this point.

22:17.510 --> 22:19.338
I'm thinking of leaving him.

22:19.381 --> 22:20.817
For Caleb.

22:20.861 --> 22:23.254
But I-I can't tell Blake
until he's recovered.

22:23.298 --> 22:25.474
Wow.

22:25.518 --> 22:29.173
Okay. So things went from zero
to <i>Fleabag</i> pretty quickly

22:29.217 --> 22:30.827
with this guy.

22:30.871 --> 22:33.830
Well, you should know
that I offered Blake a room here

22:33.874 --> 22:35.528
-at La Mirage.
-What?

22:35.571 --> 22:38.139
Yeah. So if you're
really going through with this,

22:38.182 --> 22:39.619
you need to tell Blake
the truth.

22:45.712 --> 22:49.324
Oh, Bob, I had forgotten what a
wicked sense of humor you have.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.718
Well, it runs
in the Morell family, I guess.

22:51.761 --> 22:55.504
So, Alexis tells me that you are
a former owner of the Atlantix.

22:55.548 --> 22:57.419
You ran a great organization.

22:57.463 --> 22:59.334
I've been a season ticket holder
ever since the beginning.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.815
That's great. But I'd love
to hear more about you.

23:02.859 --> 23:04.078
What was it like

23:04.121 --> 23:05.253
growing up with Alexis?

23:06.776 --> 23:08.212
You two must have
some fun stories.

23:08.256 --> 23:10.040
Well... Uh, well, I
wouldn't say

23:10.084 --> 23:12.695
that we grew up together.

23:12.739 --> 23:15.132
Yeah.
My family moved around a lot.

23:15.176 --> 23:17.134
Uh, moved around for a job.

23:17.178 --> 23:19.006
His father was a hardworking

23:19.049 --> 23:21.008
-and honest man.
-Mm.

23:21.051 --> 23:23.402
Attributes that have
definitely rubbed off on Bob.

23:23.445 --> 23:24.751
Well, I've always felt

23:24.794 --> 23:27.318
that honesty is the best policy.

23:27.362 --> 23:29.843
Bob, it's your lucky day.

23:29.886 --> 23:32.585
I'm gonna buy you out of your
share of the mineral rights.

23:32.628 --> 23:34.456
What?

23:34.500 --> 23:37.198
But, Jeff, we don't even know
how much the land is worth.

23:37.241 --> 23:39.635
It wouldn't be right
to make an offer.

23:39.679 --> 23:41.898
Mm. I think the zeroes on
this check are more than fair.

23:41.942 --> 23:43.509
Plus,

23:43.552 --> 23:46.076
you said he wanted
to be a silent partner. Right?

23:47.600 --> 23:49.079
You seem like a good guy.

23:50.080 --> 23:51.691
And you're family. So...

23:51.734 --> 23:53.170
I want to do you
this solid.

23:56.739 --> 23:58.480
Hmm.

23:58.524 --> 23:59.699
Got to say,

23:59.742 --> 24:01.352
I'm a little offended.

24:01.396 --> 24:03.790
My uncle left me
those mineral rights

24:03.833 --> 24:05.182
to keep them
in the Morell family

24:05.226 --> 24:06.836
and away from
the Carrington greed.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.229
I only showed up tonight to see
if you were on the level.

24:08.272 --> 24:09.796
See, I've had
a lot of family members

24:09.839 --> 24:11.798
take advantage of me
in the past,

24:11.841 --> 24:13.277
looking for payouts.

24:13.321 --> 24:15.192
I'm not gonna
let that happen here.

24:15.236 --> 24:17.804
Your offer is declined.

24:21.242 --> 24:22.330
Well, believe me,

24:22.373 --> 24:23.592
I certainly know a thing or two

24:23.636 --> 24:24.767
about family
looking for payouts.

24:25.899 --> 24:27.161
Apologies if I offended you.

24:31.992 --> 24:34.516
Uh, it's a little late
for communion, isn't it?

24:34.560 --> 24:36.170
We're celebrating.

24:36.213 --> 24:38.259
I'm telling Blake tomorrow
that I'm leaving him.

24:38.302 --> 24:39.869
Are you sure about this?

24:39.913 --> 24:41.218
Yes.

24:41.262 --> 24:43.873
No more stalling,
no more excuses.

24:43.917 --> 24:46.093
It's time you and I
took a step forward.

25:00.150 --> 25:01.543
Hello?

25:12.336 --> 25:14.121
Culhane!

25:14.164 --> 25:15.688
What are
you doing?

25:15.731 --> 25:17.559
You can't just be creeping up
on people like that!

25:17.603 --> 25:19.343
I didn't know
entering through the front door

25:19.387 --> 25:21.563
was considered creeping up.

25:21.607 --> 25:22.912
You okay?

25:22.956 --> 25:24.784
Yeah. I'm fine.
Why wouldn't I be?

25:24.827 --> 25:26.699
You're holding a candlestick.

25:27.917 --> 25:29.571
Because...

25:29.615 --> 25:31.878
I'm getting the silver cleaned.

25:31.921 --> 25:32.879
And I'm late.

25:32.922 --> 25:34.489
Okay then.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.143
I was just here
to visit Kirby anyway.

25:36.186 --> 25:37.579
'Kay.

25:40.321 --> 25:43.106
Okay.

25:53.464 --> 25:55.031
No.

26:03.431 --> 26:06.434
I know that you're responsible
for your mother's death.

26:06.477 --> 26:08.610
-I spoke to her nurse. Shelly?
-Shelly?

26:08.654 --> 26:11.134
Yeah, she's confused,
and so are you if you think

26:11.178 --> 26:13.223
these threats mean
anything to me.

26:13.267 --> 26:16.009
She left me written testimony,
explaining how you offered

26:16.052 --> 26:18.272
to pay her in exchange
for her silence on the matter.

26:18.315 --> 26:19.882
Classic he said/she said.

26:19.926 --> 26:21.971
It's not exactly proof, is it?

26:22.015 --> 26:23.320
Still, must stir up
your emotions.

26:27.237 --> 26:28.674
I think we're done here.

26:28.717 --> 26:30.327
So how did you do it?
Did you sneak up behind her,

26:30.371 --> 26:32.547
like you did with Alexis
when you shoved her in the fire?

26:32.591 --> 26:33.679
We're not talking
about Alexis, are we?

26:33.722 --> 26:34.897
And I didn't sneak up on anyone.

26:34.941 --> 26:36.595
Oh, my mistake.

26:36.638 --> 26:38.988
Perhaps you'd been plotting
to kill her for years.

26:39.032 --> 26:40.686
No.
No, that's not true.

26:40.729 --> 26:42.601
Isn't it?

26:42.644 --> 26:44.820
She must have caused you a lot
of pain to push you that far.

26:46.474 --> 26:48.128
-The woman raised you.
-That's enough.

26:48.171 --> 26:50.478
Did you enjoy
watching her suffer?

26:50.521 --> 26:52.567
I made sure she slipped away
in her sleep,

26:52.611 --> 26:56.223
which is more than she deserved
after lying to me my whole life.

26:58.965 --> 27:01.141
Thank you.

27:01.184 --> 27:02.708
A recorded confession

27:02.751 --> 27:04.492
is always helpful
in these situations.

27:05.711 --> 27:07.408
That'll never be
admissible in court.

27:07.451 --> 27:09.497
Perhaps not.

27:09.540 --> 27:11.760
But it should be enough
to reopen the investigation.

27:13.153 --> 27:15.155
Kirby may not care
about your past, but I do.

27:15.198 --> 27:17.548
I'm sure the police
will as well.

27:17.592 --> 27:19.333
Enjoy your sandwich.

27:23.729 --> 27:25.339
Well, I see Kirby

27:25.382 --> 27:27.080
has no shortage of visitors.

27:27.123 --> 27:28.690
How's she doing?

27:28.734 --> 27:31.084
Eh, pretty good, considering
what she's been through.

27:31.127 --> 27:32.302
Uh, she'll be happy to see you.

27:32.346 --> 27:33.956
By the way,
I looked into

27:34.000 --> 27:36.306
that season ticket holder
you asked about, Bob Morell?

27:36.350 --> 27:38.700
Yeah, let me guess, the guy
hasn't paid for his tickets,

27:38.744 --> 27:40.310
probably all sorts
of credit issues?

27:40.354 --> 27:42.095
I wouldn't know.
We don't have

27:42.138 --> 27:44.445
any season ticket holders
by that name.

27:44.488 --> 27:46.360
-Bob or Robert Morell.
-Wait, what?

27:46.403 --> 27:47.666
Ever?

27:48.754 --> 27:50.494
-Are you sure?
-I double-checked.

27:50.538 --> 27:52.018
Are you sure
you got the right guy?

27:52.061 --> 27:54.063
No.

27:54.107 --> 27:55.543
I'm not sure
about anything anymore.

28:01.331 --> 28:03.333
Oh, you're still here.

28:03.377 --> 28:05.596
I'm just getting measurements
for my decorator.

28:05.640 --> 28:07.947
Making sure there's room
for your snake pit?

28:07.990 --> 28:10.558
Oh, still witty,
even in a wheelchair.

28:10.601 --> 28:12.691
Perhaps you can wheel
yourself out of here

28:12.734 --> 28:13.692
sooner rather than later?

28:15.345 --> 28:17.913
Not to worry, I'll be moving
into La Mirage soon enough.

28:17.957 --> 28:19.959
What a wonderful idea.

28:20.002 --> 28:21.700
Maybe you can get
adjoining suites

28:21.743 --> 28:23.571
with Cristal
and her new boyfriend.

28:23.614 --> 28:25.268
You know,
I got to hand it to you,

28:25.312 --> 28:26.922
your lies
are always entertaining.

28:26.966 --> 28:28.750
You know, usually they are,

28:28.794 --> 28:32.449
but this truth
is just way more delicious.

28:33.886 --> 28:35.714
I saw Cristal and the priest,

28:35.757 --> 28:39.326
and they were looking
rather... unholy.

28:39.369 --> 28:40.806
What are you talking about?

28:40.849 --> 28:43.243
Surely you knew
she was still seeing him?

28:45.158 --> 28:48.204
Oh, another marriage
in shambles.

28:48.248 --> 28:50.032
I guess

28:50.076 --> 28:52.992
third time wasn't
the charm after all.

28:57.387 --> 29:01.000
I have a little surprise that
I think you're going to like.

29:01.043 --> 29:03.611
Is it chocolate chip cookies
for the flight?

29:03.654 --> 29:05.178
'Cause the jet's waiting,
so I'm not sure

29:05.221 --> 29:06.570
what's going on here.

29:06.614 --> 29:08.137
-Step.
-Step. Whoa.

29:08.181 --> 29:11.401
What's going on is that
we don't need the jet,

29:11.445 --> 29:15.449
because we have already
arrived at our destination.

29:15.492 --> 29:19.018
Welcome to our
backyard honeymoon.

29:20.062 --> 29:21.455
Surprise.

29:21.498 --> 29:23.283
Fallon, what did you do?

29:23.326 --> 29:24.719
I think you mean,
what didn't I do?

29:24.763 --> 29:28.157
Tiki bar? Check.
Polynesian cuisine?

29:28.201 --> 29:31.117
Check. And that is
actual beach sand

29:31.160 --> 29:33.293
flown in from Bora Bora.

29:33.336 --> 29:34.947
It's gonna feel like
we're actually there.

29:36.470 --> 29:38.864
But you realize we actually
could be there, right?

29:38.907 --> 29:40.256
We just have
to get on the plane.

29:40.300 --> 29:42.041
Why did you go
to all this trouble?

29:42.084 --> 29:45.696
Well, I was thinking and,
you know, vacationing in public

29:45.740 --> 29:48.482
after my father and best friend
were injured at our wedding?

29:48.525 --> 29:50.005
The optics
aren't great.

29:50.049 --> 29:51.441
I mean, we'd get
hammered in the press.

29:51.485 --> 29:54.227
So, that's it? Optics?

29:54.270 --> 29:56.011
Are you sure there's
nothing else going on with you?

29:56.055 --> 30:00.059
Not unless you mean scuba
lessons in the pool in an hour.

30:00.102 --> 30:01.843
Oh...

30:01.887 --> 30:03.889
Let's get
this honeymoon started.

30:03.932 --> 30:05.978
Come on!

30:10.547 --> 30:11.766
Anders.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.681
A moment, please?

30:13.724 --> 30:17.467
I've been tortured
by this decision for minutes,

30:17.511 --> 30:19.861
and though you will always hold
a special place in my heart...

30:19.905 --> 30:22.342
I wasn't aware
you had one.

30:22.385 --> 30:24.866
Dry wit aside, I think
it's best you vacate the Manor.

30:24.910 --> 30:28.043
After all, your loyalty
lies with Blake.

30:28.087 --> 30:31.786
I take your point, but I have
no intention of going anywhere.

30:31.830 --> 30:34.876
Does anybody understand
what "homeowner" means?

30:34.920 --> 30:37.923
I'm not leaving Kirby
while she recovers.

30:37.966 --> 30:39.794
And I'm certainly
not leaving her alone

30:39.838 --> 30:41.274
with your deranged son.

30:42.405 --> 30:43.885
Uh...

30:43.929 --> 30:46.235
Will you excuse us, please?
Thank you.

30:46.279 --> 30:49.021
Aren't you getting a little
tired of this witch hunt?

30:49.064 --> 30:50.718
Even the Lord rested
on the seventh day.

30:50.761 --> 30:53.155
I know you were pushed
into the fire by Adam.

30:53.199 --> 30:54.243
What I don't
know is why

30:54.287 --> 30:55.375
you would forgive him.

30:56.376 --> 30:58.204
Because he's my son.

30:58.247 --> 31:00.597
Having him in my life is more
important to me than anything.

31:00.641 --> 31:02.512
The man tried to kill you.

31:02.556 --> 31:05.776
Yes, well, he can get
a little rambunctious.

31:05.820 --> 31:09.171
Adam was hurt by past
mistakes that I made.

31:09.215 --> 31:11.173
But we both have
moved beyond our hurt

31:11.217 --> 31:13.175
so we can remain in
each other's lives.

31:13.219 --> 31:17.092
At the end of the day, keeping
our children in our lives

31:17.136 --> 31:18.789
is all that matters.

31:22.097 --> 31:23.403
-Here.
-Fallon, it's not that
I don't appreciate

31:23.446 --> 31:25.057
the effort
that you put into this,

31:25.100 --> 31:28.451
it's just, uh, I don't know,
it's just not quite the same.

31:28.495 --> 31:30.453
That just requires a
fair amount of tequila

31:30.497 --> 31:32.542
and a little
imagination.

31:32.586 --> 31:33.979
And close your eyes.

31:34.022 --> 31:35.371
-Close your eyes.
-Okay.

31:38.113 --> 31:40.942
You feel that warm
island breeze?

31:40.986 --> 31:43.162
It'’s nice, right?

31:43.205 --> 31:44.641
Not bad.

31:44.685 --> 31:46.034
It's starting to feel more
like a honeymoon now.

31:46.078 --> 31:48.297
Oh, you see?
Of course it is.

31:48.341 --> 31:51.039
It's just me and you alone

31:51.083 --> 31:52.954
on the beach.

31:52.998 --> 31:55.130
What the hell?

32:01.006 --> 32:03.704
Well, so much
for alone on the beach.

32:03.747 --> 32:06.446
No, no, no, just consider
them island natives, okay?

32:06.489 --> 32:08.013
They'’ll be gone
soon enough.

32:08.056 --> 32:09.928
It's kind of hard
to ignore the noise.
No.

32:09.971 --> 32:12.191
It'’s not. We just need some
tropical music, that's all.

32:13.453 --> 32:14.976
Tropical music?

32:15.020 --> 32:17.848
Oh, wow.

32:17.892 --> 32:20.764
-Aw.
Thank you

32:20.808 --> 32:22.244
for being here.

32:22.288 --> 32:24.638
It is only through hard work
and dedication

32:24.681 --> 32:26.379
that I stand here today.

32:26.422 --> 32:28.337
I had a vision,a vision

32:28.381 --> 32:31.297
that combined
luxury and elegance

32:31.340 --> 32:33.429
and a whole lot of bling.

32:33.473 --> 32:34.909
So...

32:36.650 --> 32:39.305
...without further ado,
today we break ground

32:39.348 --> 32:42.525
on the Alexis Carrington
Diamond Company.

32:45.267 --> 32:47.008
Show'’s over, people.

32:47.052 --> 32:48.444
Jeff!

32:48.488 --> 32:50.185
I'm glad you made it...

32:50.229 --> 32:51.795
Yeah, save it, all right?
This guy isn'’t your cousin.

32:51.839 --> 32:53.406
Of course he is.

32:53.449 --> 32:55.364
When I found out
that there'’s no

32:55.408 --> 32:57.062
season ticket holder
at the Atlantix

32:57.105 --> 32:58.759
named Bob Morell,
I did some research.

32:58.802 --> 33:00.326
A little somethingI pulled

33:00.369 --> 33:02.067
from the La Mirage
security camera, ran it

33:02.110 --> 33:03.894
through my facial ID
and discovered his name

33:03.938 --> 33:06.636
is Dave Powell,
some local, out-of-work actor.

33:06.680 --> 33:08.421
Excuse me, I have
a pizza commercial

33:08.464 --> 33:09.944
running throughout
the southeast.

33:09.988 --> 33:12.077
Who'’s the third partner, Alexis?

33:12.120 --> 33:13.687
You can tell me now or I'’ll
figure it out for myself.

33:13.730 --> 33:16.603
Wait! Wait! Excuse me!

33:16.646 --> 33:19.693
Excuse me. It's me!
I'm the third partner!

33:19.736 --> 33:21.651
I own the mineral rights.

33:21.695 --> 33:23.653
What?

33:23.697 --> 33:26.352
I wanted to tell you the truth,
but she forced me to lie.

33:29.746 --> 33:33.620
Nothing better
than a poolside massage.

33:33.663 --> 33:35.361
Am I right?

33:35.404 --> 33:37.232
Yeah, except for a poolside
massage with some privacy.

33:37.276 --> 33:39.365
Which we, oh,
clearly don'’t have.

33:39.408 --> 33:42.455
Oh, don'’t be silly,
nobody'’s looking over here.

33:42.498 --> 33:44.457
We'’re basically alone.

33:44.500 --> 33:46.067
Hey.

33:46.111 --> 33:48.896
No one told me there was
a party going on down here.

33:50.245 --> 33:52.465
Mmm.

33:52.508 --> 33:54.554
-Are you gonna drink this?
-No, please don't...

33:54.597 --> 33:55.772
Thank you, bye.

33:55.816 --> 33:57.252
How could you do this me?

33:57.296 --> 33:58.645
Jeff, please,

33:58.688 --> 34:00.081
calm down.
Yes, it'’s true,

34:00.125 --> 34:01.387
Dominique holds
the mineral rights.

34:01.430 --> 34:02.823
But you are
still gonna get

34:02.866 --> 34:04.433
a healthy share of the profits.

34:04.477 --> 34:05.695
I don'’t care
about the damn money.

34:05.739 --> 34:06.957
I can'’t trust you anymore.

34:07.001 --> 34:08.089
And I don'’t
do business

34:08.133 --> 34:09.482
with people I can'’t trust.

34:09.525 --> 34:10.613
-Wait.
-It's over.

34:10.657 --> 34:12.093
I'’m pulling my money out of this

34:12.137 --> 34:13.486
little circus show
and shutting it down.

34:13.529 --> 34:15.488
You can all go home!

34:15.531 --> 34:17.707
No! No, no, no, no, no.
We don't want to go home!

34:17.751 --> 34:19.622
Of course I'm not
gonna backstab... You got my back?

34:19.666 --> 34:20.841
Of course I have... This is how you got my back?

34:22.147 --> 34:24.018
Off the lawn and go home.

34:30.155 --> 34:32.287
Okay, yeah, yeah,
I think we'’re done here.

34:32.331 --> 34:34.724
No, no, no, no, no!
We can't leave paradise.

34:34.768 --> 34:36.596
We have to stay.
Look, if you're hungry,

34:36.639 --> 34:38.467
we'll eat here!
I ordered a pig on a spit!

34:38.511 --> 34:40.469
-Fallon, come on!
-Please don't leave, okay?

34:40.513 --> 34:42.123
I promise you,
it's all gonna blow over.

34:42.167 --> 34:44.125
I'm done with this, Fallon!

34:44.169 --> 34:46.127
Look, I don't know what'’s going
on with you, but when you're

34:46.171 --> 34:48.477
ready to talk about it,
just let me know.

34:48.521 --> 34:50.044
Liam.

35:02.187 --> 35:04.754
You can start packing
whatever cardboard box

35:04.798 --> 35:06.887
you showed up here with.
How dare you turn on me

35:06.930 --> 35:09.019
-out there?
-All part of my plan.

35:09.063 --> 35:11.674
Jeff had already
given up on you.

35:11.718 --> 35:13.198
I thought I might be able
to curry some favor

35:13.241 --> 35:14.721
and get the money we need.

35:14.764 --> 35:16.505
And how did that go, exactly?

35:17.506 --> 35:19.073
Okay, today was a fail.

35:19.117 --> 35:20.944
Surely there'’s another way
to get the money.

35:20.988 --> 35:23.251
-How about a bank loan?
-We need millions.

35:23.295 --> 35:25.035
And I'’m not willing
to put up the manor

35:25.079 --> 35:27.081
as collateral
after all I did to get it.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.691
There's always another way.

35:28.735 --> 35:30.171
Mrs. Colby,

35:30.215 --> 35:31.825
-this just came for you.
-Thank you.

35:33.174 --> 35:34.958
Oh, how fitting.

35:35.002 --> 35:36.960
My divorce papers from Jeff.

35:37.004 --> 35:38.875
Wait, what?
You mean

35:38.919 --> 35:41.139
you haven'’t signed anything yet?

35:47.536 --> 35:50.322
-I hear you were looking for me?
-Yeah, I need you to get me

35:50.365 --> 35:52.280
a box of my Cubans
from that shop in town.

35:52.324 --> 35:53.847
The Smokers Hut?

35:53.890 --> 35:55.892
But you only get those
when you lose a big deal.

35:55.936 --> 35:57.546
Well, in a way I have.

35:57.590 --> 36:00.636
-I may have lost Cristal.
-Oh.

36:00.680 --> 36:02.551
Sounds like you had
a crap-filled day, too.

36:02.595 --> 36:04.292
I'’ll send someone
out for those cigars.

36:04.336 --> 36:07.295
No, your mother fired my staff.

36:07.339 --> 36:09.210
Please, would you just
do this for me?

36:09.254 --> 36:12.170
No, I, uh... I can'’t...
I can't leave right now.

36:12.213 --> 36:13.867
-Why not?
-Because I can'’t.

36:13.910 --> 36:16.957
-Because why?
-Because I'’m afraid!

36:17.000 --> 36:19.786
Okay? I...

36:19.829 --> 36:21.875
I thought that
I was staying here

36:21.918 --> 36:24.530
because I felt guilty about
what happened to you and Kirby,

36:24.573 --> 36:27.054
but I don'’t feel guilty at all.

36:27.097 --> 36:29.099
Well, that'’s more like
the Fallon I know.

36:29.143 --> 36:31.798
This place
is a safe zone for me.

36:31.841 --> 36:34.801
And I'’m afraid
to go out into the world.

36:34.844 --> 36:37.020
I mean, I trusted Evan,
and look how wrong I was.

36:37.064 --> 36:38.892
What if I can'’t trust
my own judgment anymore?

36:38.935 --> 36:40.415
I'’ll just be out,
alone, in the world

36:40.459 --> 36:43.462
making bad decisions
that could get people stabbed.

36:43.505 --> 36:45.464
Fallon, you can'’t
trust everyone,

36:45.507 --> 36:47.596
but you do have one person
you can trust.

36:47.640 --> 36:49.250
Someone who'’s gonna
look out for you.

36:49.294 --> 36:50.686
That'’s what marriage is about.

36:50.730 --> 36:52.210
You'’re not alone.

36:52.253 --> 36:54.255
No.

36:54.299 --> 36:56.649
You're right, I'’m married, or...

36:56.692 --> 36:58.172
at least I hope I still am.

36:58.216 --> 36:59.652
I have to go.

36:59.695 --> 37:01.828
Oh, and the Blake Carrington

37:01.871 --> 37:04.613
I know would never
give up this easily.

37:04.657 --> 37:06.876
So if you don'’t
want to be alone,

37:06.920 --> 37:08.704
and you really
want Cristal...

37:10.010 --> 37:11.881
...go fight for her.

37:16.799 --> 37:18.671
Wait, that's a seven.

37:18.714 --> 37:20.629
No, no, that's right.
-It was right.
-Oh, no, that's a five.

37:23.023 --> 37:25.243
Hey, I'll-I'll be
back in a while.

37:25.286 --> 37:26.635
No, no, please stay.

37:26.679 --> 37:29.203
This concerns you both.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.466
I've thought about it
and I've realized

37:31.510 --> 37:33.990
that I myself have
a few things in my past

37:34.034 --> 37:36.166
that I'm not terribly proud of.

37:36.210 --> 37:37.342
Turns out,

37:37.385 --> 37:39.126
good people can do bad things.

37:39.169 --> 37:40.997
I shouldn't be holding

37:41.041 --> 37:43.435
Adam to a higher standard
than I do myself.

37:43.478 --> 37:46.046
Therefore, I won't
be going to the police

37:46.089 --> 37:48.788
with the information I gathered
and I'll delete the recording.

37:48.831 --> 37:50.268
I'm glad to hear that.

37:50.311 --> 37:52.531
I can see how much
you care for my daughter.

37:52.574 --> 37:54.359
And, Kirby,

37:54.402 --> 37:57.231
given time, I hope that you'll
realize how much I care for you,

37:57.275 --> 37:58.580
as well.

37:58.624 --> 38:00.365
This is a great start.

38:20.428 --> 38:22.082
Blake?

38:22.125 --> 38:23.562
Is this a bad time?

38:23.605 --> 38:24.867
No, your timing's perfect.

38:24.911 --> 38:26.304
Will you excuse us?

38:30.003 --> 38:31.221
You look good.

38:32.440 --> 38:33.485
I hope you're feeling better.

38:33.528 --> 38:35.356
I am... now.

38:36.705 --> 38:39.012
I missed you so much.

38:39.055 --> 38:41.536
In fact...

38:41.580 --> 38:43.886
I was hoping
we could work things out.

38:43.930 --> 38:45.888
Blake, that's why I'm here.

38:45.932 --> 38:47.673
I wanted to talk to you...

38:47.716 --> 38:49.370
I know that I've put CA ahead
of you far too many times,

38:49.414 --> 38:50.719
and I was wrong.

38:50.763 --> 38:52.678
You are the top priority

38:52.721 --> 38:54.462
in my life,
as you always should've been.

38:54.506 --> 38:56.856
Blake, I really need to...

38:56.899 --> 38:58.510
Oh! Ow! Sorry.

38:58.553 --> 39:01.556
It's just...
Oh, these ice packs.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.428
Just so uncomfortable.

39:03.471 --> 39:05.734
Well, that's because
they're in the wrong place.

39:05.778 --> 39:07.954
Your inflammation will
never go down at this rate.

39:07.997 --> 39:09.912
Here.

39:09.956 --> 39:13.351
And what were those silly
stretches your PT had you doing?

39:13.394 --> 39:14.787
She's doing a terrible job.

39:14.830 --> 39:17.093
Forgot what
a great therapist you are.

39:18.617 --> 39:20.619
Hey, maybe you could
leave me some exercises

39:20.662 --> 39:22.360
to try.

39:22.403 --> 39:24.057
I-I guess I could
write up a list.

39:24.100 --> 39:25.972
I mean, you know, it's not
as good as the real thing,

39:26.015 --> 39:28.322
but anything
to speed along my recovery.

39:29.715 --> 39:31.978
Or, I suppose,

39:32.021 --> 39:33.806
I could take over
as your therapist.

39:33.849 --> 39:36.809
Oh, honey, that-that's
very generous of you,

39:36.852 --> 39:39.638
-but I don't deserve that.
-You also

39:39.681 --> 39:41.553
don't deserve to suffer
due to incompetence.

39:41.596 --> 39:43.772
If you want,
I'll help.

39:43.816 --> 39:45.861
But for PT only.
I'm not moving back in

39:45.905 --> 39:47.167
and we're not back together.

39:47.210 --> 39:49.299
This is just to get you
walking again.

39:49.343 --> 39:50.997
I can't believe
you would do that.

39:52.085 --> 39:53.913
I'll go get you
a fresh ice pack.

39:57.873 --> 39:59.875
Did I screw things up enough?

39:59.919 --> 40:01.616
Oh, you...

40:01.660 --> 40:03.792
were wonderfully bad.
You are hereby replaced.

40:03.836 --> 40:06.186
Hmm.

40:12.235 --> 40:14.803
So...

40:14.847 --> 40:17.371
I'm ready to talk now.

40:23.638 --> 40:25.466
I was afraid to leave the manor.

40:25.510 --> 40:27.729
Yeah, I kind of figured
that out.

40:27.773 --> 40:29.818
I know I should have
talked to you about it.

40:29.862 --> 40:32.473
I don't know why I didn't.
But I guess I'm just...

40:32.517 --> 40:33.996
not used to having a husband.

40:34.040 --> 40:35.650
I mean, I've only

40:35.694 --> 40:38.044
-been married 48 hours.
-Yeah.

40:38.087 --> 40:39.872
But what a great 48 hours
it's been.

40:39.915 --> 40:41.743
Yeah.

40:41.787 --> 40:44.920
And now I know that
if the whole world turns on me,

40:44.964 --> 40:47.880
I have someone in my corner
I can trust.

40:47.923 --> 40:49.751
Now and forever.

40:49.795 --> 40:52.493
That's what husbands are for,
among other things.

40:57.672 --> 41:01.241
A toast to our diamond mine
soon to be back on track.

41:01.284 --> 41:04.070
Diamonds really are
-a girl's best friend.
-Mm.

41:07.247 --> 41:08.553
Jeff!

41:08.596 --> 41:10.250
What a wonderful surprise.

41:10.293 --> 41:11.643
So you didn't
sign the divorce papers.

41:11.686 --> 41:13.514
You looking for more money,
I assume?

41:13.558 --> 41:15.516
Do you really think

41:15.560 --> 41:18.040
you can blackmail me into paying
for your little diamond dream?

41:18.084 --> 41:20.521
Oh, blackmail
is so pedestrian.

41:20.565 --> 41:23.306
I simply realized I deserve
more in the divorce.

41:24.525 --> 41:26.179
Well, I see you've chosen sides.

41:26.222 --> 41:27.659
You know,
turning your back

41:27.702 --> 41:29.182
on family certainly
keeps you consistent.

41:29.225 --> 41:30.879
Jeff, sweetheart,
it's not like that.

41:30.923 --> 41:32.228
Oh, don't bother, okay?

41:32.272 --> 41:33.926
The fact that you're here
speaks volumes.

41:35.231 --> 41:36.798
But neither of you are getting
a dime from me.

41:36.842 --> 41:39.932
Then this divorce is
going to get very ugly.

41:39.975 --> 41:41.281
It will.

41:41.324 --> 41:43.109
I offered you this house
in our settlement

41:43.152 --> 41:45.546
as a goodwill gesture, but
as long as we're still married,

41:45.590 --> 41:48.027
I own half of it, and I'm
moving in until this is settled.

41:48.070 --> 41:49.942
You can't do that.

41:49.985 --> 41:51.639
Oh, but I can.

41:51.683 --> 41:53.554
You want ugly?

41:53.598 --> 41:55.338
You're about to get your wish.
