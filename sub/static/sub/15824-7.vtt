WEBVTT

00:52.186 --> 00:53.821
DETECTIVE ORTEGA?

00:53.854 --> 00:55.256
YES.

00:55.289 --> 00:58.292
YES. YOU MUST BE
COMMANDER TAYLOR.

00:58.326 --> 01:01.162
THAT WOULD BE ME.
THIS WAY.

01:01.195 --> 01:04.198
I WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR TAKING THE TIME

01:04.232 --> 01:05.433
TO LOOK INTO THIS.

01:05.466 --> 01:06.734
OH, IT'S A PLEASURE.

01:06.767 --> 01:08.469
WE'RE ALWAYS HAPPY TO HELP OUT
OUR FRIENDS

01:08.502 --> 01:10.204
IN THE PHOENIX
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

01:11.472 --> 01:14.775
19-YEAR-OLD WOMAN
NAMED SEDONA GIBSON,

01:14.808 --> 01:16.877
ORIGINALLY FROM PHOENIX,

01:16.910 --> 01:19.380
FOUND DEAD
IN A HOTEL ROOM LAST WEEK.

01:19.413 --> 01:22.116
HOLLYWOOD DIVISION WAS UNABLE
TO I.D. HER BODY TILL YESTERDAY,

01:22.150 --> 01:26.454
WHICH IS WHY DETECTIVE ORTEGA
HERE ONLY JUST ARRIVED.

01:26.487 --> 01:28.556
I HAVE CONCERNS
ABOUT THE CORONER'S RULING.

01:28.589 --> 01:31.825
HOLLYWOOD TOLD ME I'D BE BETTER
SERVED BY COMING DOWNTOWN.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.627
DID THEY?

01:33.661 --> 01:35.496
ALL RIGHT.

01:35.529 --> 01:38.266
UH, PRELIMINARY AUTOPSY REPORT.
SEDONA GIBSON.

01:38.299 --> 01:41.169
STATES CAUSE OF DEATH
WAS EITHER ACCIDENTAL

01:41.202 --> 01:42.703
OR DELIBERATE
HEROIN OVERDOSE --
OVERDOSE.

01:42.736 --> 01:44.238
YES.

01:44.272 --> 01:45.706
BUT NEITHER OF THOSE THINGS
CAN BE TRUE.

01:45.739 --> 01:47.708
JUST, UH, OUT OF CURIOSITY,

01:47.741 --> 01:51.379
WHY IS THE PHOENIX P.D.
INTERESTED IN THIS CASE?

01:51.412 --> 01:53.514
WELL, THEY'RE NOT.

01:53.547 --> 01:57.918
THE VICTIM, SEDONA --

01:57.951 --> 01:59.720
SHE WAS MY DAUGHTER.

02:11.399 --> 02:14.202
I'M...SO SORRY,
DETECTIVE ORTEGA.

02:14.235 --> 02:15.936
I'M SURE THAT THIS MUST BE
A VERY DIFFICULT TIME

02:15.969 --> 02:17.271
FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.

02:17.305 --> 02:19.540
I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU WORK NARCOTICS

02:19.573 --> 02:21.342
FOR THE PHOENIX P.D.?
YES.

02:21.375 --> 02:24.478
AND I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH
THE PROFESSIONAL COURTESY

02:24.512 --> 02:26.480
OF LOOKING
INTO THIS MATTER.

02:26.514 --> 02:27.748
OF COURSE.

02:27.781 --> 02:28.816
OF COURSE.

02:28.849 --> 02:30.518
YOU HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE

02:30.551 --> 02:33.487
THAT THE CORONER'S INVESTIGATION
WAS INACCURATE?

02:33.521 --> 02:38.392
MY DAUGHTER WAS
A TYPE-1 DIABETIC.

02:38.426 --> 02:39.827
SHE KNEW THE RISKS INVOLVED
WITH HER DISEASE,

02:39.860 --> 02:41.429
AND SHE ALSO KNEW
THAT DRUG USE

02:41.462 --> 02:42.696
WOULD SEVERELY MAGNIFY
THOSE RISKS.

02:42.730 --> 02:45.233
Pope: DETECTIVE...

02:45.266 --> 02:47.301
HAVING A GOOD REASON
NOT TO DO SOMETHING

02:47.335 --> 02:50.338
DOESN'T MEAN THAT PEOPLE
WON'T TRY IT,

02:50.371 --> 02:51.872
ESPECIALLY WHEN
THEY'RE YOUNG.

02:51.905 --> 02:54.408
AND HER TOX SCREEN
CAME BACK POSITIVE FOR HEROIN

02:54.442 --> 02:55.609
AND AMBIEN.

02:55.643 --> 02:56.744
SHE WASN'T
A HEROIN ADDICT.

02:57.911 --> 02:58.846
PLEASE.

02:59.980 --> 03:02.350
THERE'S ANOTHER
EXPLANATION.

03:02.383 --> 03:04.752
HAS ANYONE EVEN TALKED
TO HER ASSHOLE HUSBAND?

03:04.785 --> 03:06.254
IS HIS NAME DREW?

03:06.287 --> 03:07.655
YES, DREW.
DREW GIBSON.

03:07.688 --> 03:10.258
HOLLYWOOD TRIED TRACKING HIM
DOWN, CHIEF.

03:10.291 --> 03:13.427
SAID DREW WAS UNREACHABLE
AT HIS LAST-KNOWN ADDRESS.

03:13.461 --> 03:15.629
Pope: DO YOU HAVE SOME REASON
TO BELIEVE THAT HER HUSBAND

03:15.663 --> 03:16.797
WAS INVOLVED
IN HER DEATH?

03:16.830 --> 03:18.732
SHE DIDN'T DO THIS
TO HERSELF.

03:18.766 --> 03:19.933
THAT, I KNOW.

03:19.967 --> 03:22.836
AND DREW WAS NOT
A GOOD MAN.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.706
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE
YOU'VE SEEN YOUR DAUGHTER?

03:29.443 --> 03:30.644
ALMOST TWO YEARS.

03:35.649 --> 03:38.319
WELL, SEDONA WAS 17,

03:38.352 --> 03:39.920
A JUNIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL,
WHEN SHE MET DREW,

03:39.953 --> 03:43.924
AND -- AND HE WAS 23 --
OLDER --

03:43.957 --> 03:46.260
AND A VERY BAD INFLUENCE.

03:46.294 --> 03:47.795
SO MY HUSBAND AND I

03:47.828 --> 03:50.964
TOLD SEDONA THAT SHE HAD TO
STOP SEEING HIM...

03:50.998 --> 03:52.833
OR LEAVE HOME.

03:52.866 --> 03:55.403
SO SHE...

03:55.436 --> 03:57.805
SHE DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL
AND CAME TO LOS ANGELES.

03:57.838 --> 03:58.906
WITH DREW?

03:58.939 --> 04:01.409
YES, AND SHE
MARRIED HIM HERE.

04:01.442 --> 04:04.345
AND, UH, HAVE YOU SPOKEN
WITH HER SINCE?

04:04.378 --> 04:06.980
SHE CALLED...

04:07.014 --> 04:09.016
A FEW WEEKS AGO.

04:09.049 --> 04:11.785
BUT BEFORE WE HAD A CHANCE
TO SAY MUCH,

04:11.819 --> 04:14.522
MY HUSBAND TOOK THE PHONE
AWAY FROM ME AND HUNG UP ON HER.

04:14.555 --> 04:16.890
Brenda: DO YOU KNOW WHY
SHE WAS CALLING?

04:16.924 --> 04:19.460
NO, I...

04:19.493 --> 04:22.796
I TRIED TO FIND HER, BUT...
HER NUMBER WAS BLOCKED,

04:22.830 --> 04:24.898
AND I COULDN'T LEGALLY
RUN HER NAME.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.534
DETECTIVE,
I-I'M SURE THAT...

04:26.567 --> 04:29.537
WORKING IN NARCOTICS
MAKES LOSING A CHILD TO DRUGS

04:29.570 --> 04:31.705
THAT MUCH HARDER, BUT...

04:31.739 --> 04:33.774
IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR SOMEONE
IN YOUR DAUGHTER'S PROFESSION

04:33.807 --> 04:35.976
TO MAKE QUESTIONABLE CHOICES
LIKE THIS.

04:36.009 --> 04:37.010
WHAT PROFESSION?

04:37.044 --> 04:39.880
UM...

04:39.913 --> 04:41.849
WHAT PROFESSION?

04:41.882 --> 04:44.852
HOLLYWOOD DIVISION CLAIMS
THAT YOUR DAUGHTER

04:44.885 --> 04:47.855
WAS WORKING AS AN ESCORT
WHEN SHE DIED.

04:49.523 --> 04:50.891
Pope:
I'M SORRY. DETECTIVE?

04:50.924 --> 04:53.394
WILL YOU EXCUSE US
JUST FOR A MOMENT, PLEASE?

05:00.000 --> 05:01.835
DID YOU BRING THAT POOR WOMAN
DOWN HERE

05:01.869 --> 05:03.737
SO THAT I'D HAVE TO BE THE ONE
TO TELL HER

05:03.771 --> 05:05.439
THAT HER DAUGHTER
WAS A PROSTITUTE?

05:05.473 --> 05:07.441
NO. OF COURSE NOT. I THOUGHT
HOLLYWOOD DIVISION TOLD HER.

05:07.475 --> 05:08.909
HOLLYWOOD DIVISION?

05:08.942 --> 05:11.111
THEY RAN A PRETTY BARE-BONES
INVESTIGATION, DIDN'T THEY?

05:11.144 --> 05:13.347
WELL, A HOOKER DEAD FROM
AN OVERDOSE IN A HOTEL ROOM

05:13.381 --> 05:14.748
DOESN'T USUALLY JUSTIFY
A LOT OF SHOE LEATHER.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.884
HOLLYWOOD DID
THEIR DUE DILIGENCE.

05:16.917 --> 05:19.820
THEY BRUSHED HER OFF --
JUST LIKE THEY DID HER MOTHER.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.755
THEY DIDN'T SEARCH
HER RESIDENCE.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.757
THEY DIDN'T CALL
ANYONE --

05:23.791 --> 05:25.359
NOT HER LAST JOHN
OR THIS HUSBAND OF HERS.

05:25.393 --> 05:27.928
THEY ONLY JUST I.D.'d
THE BODY.

05:27.961 --> 05:30.631
DETECTIVE ORTEGA IS A FELLOW
LAW-ENFORCEMENT OFFICER,

05:30.664 --> 05:33.401
SO LET'S HUMOR HER
A LITTLE.

05:34.702 --> 05:37.104
WHAT IS CAPTAIN RAYDOR
DOING HERE?

05:37.137 --> 05:39.106
WELL, SHE FINISHED
REVIEWING THE DEPOSITIONS

05:39.139 --> 05:41.008
YOU AND YOUR SQUAD GAVE
IN THE CIVIL SUIT,

05:41.041 --> 05:42.543
AND NOW SHE HAS SOME
FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS

05:42.576 --> 05:43.977
FOR DETECTIVE SANCHEZ.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.746
WHY?!

05:45.779 --> 05:46.947
WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT
THIS TURELL BAYLOR BUSINESS

05:46.980 --> 05:48.015
TILL WE'RE BLUE
IN THE FACE!

05:48.048 --> 05:49.917
ACTUALLY, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.152
YOUR ENTIRE SQUAD HAS
STARTED REFERRING RAYDOR
TO THEIR UNION REPS.

05:52.185 --> 05:55.022
MAYBE YOU COULD CONVINCE SANCHEZ
TO COOPERATE A LITTLE?

05:55.055 --> 05:56.590
EXACTLY HOW MANY PEOPLE

05:56.624 --> 05:58.892
AM I SUPPOSED TO BE HUMORING
AROUND HERE, HUH?

05:58.926 --> 06:01.061
DETECTIVE ORTEGA.
CAPTAIN RAYDOR.

06:01.094 --> 06:03.764
DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS
TO DO YOUR JOB

06:03.797 --> 06:05.566
WHILE HUMORING SO MANY
DIFFICULT PEOPLE?

06:06.967 --> 06:09.803
I MIGHT HAVE SOME IDEA.
YEAH.

06:16.477 --> 06:19.046
CHIEF, A, UH, OFFICER
FROM HOLLYWOOD DIVISION

06:19.079 --> 06:19.880
JUST DROPPED THIS OFF.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.582
IT'S THE SUM TOTAL

06:21.615 --> 06:23.016
OF THE EVIDENCE THEY COLLECTED
FROM THE HOTEL ROOM

06:23.050 --> 06:24.618
WHERE DETECTIVE ORTEGA'S
DAUGHTER WAS FOUND.

06:24.652 --> 06:27.154
Flynn: NOT MUCH TO IT,
EXCEPT THE, UH,

06:27.187 --> 06:28.889
SYRINGE THAT KILLED HER.

06:28.922 --> 06:32.059
UH, HER HEELS, COAT,

06:32.092 --> 06:34.027
AND...SMALL PURSE.

06:34.061 --> 06:36.196
Tao:
IT'S CALLED A CLUTCH.

06:36.229 --> 06:39.533
SMALL PURSE --
IT'S CALLED A CLUTCH.

06:39.567 --> 06:43.471
YEAH. OKAY.
THE CLUTCH.

06:43.504 --> 06:45.806
IT HAD $24 IN IT,

06:45.839 --> 06:47.708
A RECEIPT FROM THE TAXI
THE NIGHT SHE DIED.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.209
NO DRUGS, NO PHONE.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.478
CHIEF.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.815
UM, DETECTIVE ORTEGA,

06:54.848 --> 06:56.584
WE ARE GETTING A WARRANT

06:56.617 --> 06:57.851
TO SEARCH
YOUR DAUGHTER'S APARTMENT,

06:57.885 --> 06:59.186
AND IN THE MEANTIME,

06:59.219 --> 07:01.221
DETECTIVE SANCHEZ
IS GOING TO THE MORGUE

07:01.254 --> 07:03.023
TO SEE IF HE CAN EXPEDITE THE
RELEASE OF YOUR DAUGHTER'S --

07:03.056 --> 07:04.492
I WANT TO GO WITH HIM.

07:04.525 --> 07:07.628
UM, I-I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA.

07:07.661 --> 07:08.962
PLEASE.

07:08.996 --> 07:11.865
I'VE WAITED SO LONG
TO SEE MY DAUGHTER.

07:11.899 --> 07:13.066
PLEASE.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.110
YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO DO THIS, DETECTIVE?

07:23.143 --> 07:24.845
I COULD PREPARE THE BODY
IN A ROOM. I COULD --

07:24.878 --> 07:26.113
IT'S NOT MY FIRST TIME
IN A MORGUE.

07:26.146 --> 07:27.848
I KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT.

07:27.881 --> 07:31.752
LET ME. PLEASE.

08:36.950 --> 08:40.721
THERE'S ONLY ONE INJECTION SITE,
JUST ONE.

08:40.754 --> 08:44.191
SHE'S GOT NEEDLE MARKS
ON HER STOMACH AND LEGS, TOO.

08:44.224 --> 08:47.828
THOSE ARE PROBABLY FROM
HER INSULIN INJECTIONS.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.931
DOCTOR,
IF I RECALL CORRECTLY...

08:50.964 --> 08:52.633
YOUR AUTOPSY
REPORTED NOTHING

08:52.666 --> 08:54.635
THAT WOULD INDICATE
CHRONIC DRUG USE.

08:54.668 --> 08:56.770
UM, LET ME SEE.

08:59.106 --> 09:00.808
DNA's NOT IN YET.

09:00.841 --> 09:02.910
THEY MUST HAVE I.D.'d HER
SOME OTHER WAY.

09:02.943 --> 09:05.012
BUT I DO HAVE RESULTS

09:05.045 --> 09:06.814
ON A HAIR-FOLLICLE
DRUG TEST,

09:06.847 --> 09:07.815
AND SHE WAS CLEAN.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.349
SO SHE WASN'T A USER?

09:09.382 --> 09:10.584
OR THIS WAS
HER FIRST TIME.

09:11.619 --> 09:13.020
DETECTIVE SANCHEZ.

09:16.023 --> 09:17.658
OKAY. SEND IT OVER.

09:20.628 --> 09:22.696
WE GOT THE WARRANT TO SEARCH
YOUR DAUGHTER'S APARTMENT.

09:58.165 --> 09:59.800
FLIGHT BACK FROM VEGAS.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.273
$100 CHIPS.

10:19.987 --> 10:23.223
A NOTE IN
A FOREIGN LANGUAGE.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.095
NO SIGN OF DRUG USE.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.262
DO YOU WANT TO LOOK
THROUGH THE PURSE, MA'AM?

10:29.296 --> 10:31.064
YEAH.

10:41.074 --> 10:44.311
SHE HAS AN I.D. FOR
SANTA MONICA COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

10:44.344 --> 10:47.114
SHE'S GOT HER G.E.D.
UP HERE, TOO.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.836
YOUR DAUGHTER
WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.472
SHE WAS, WASN'T SHE?

11:12.505 --> 11:14.808
Sanchez: BUZZ.
I NEED YOU.

11:19.747 --> 11:21.982
TAG THIS.
TAG THIS.

11:29.056 --> 11:32.159
LIEUTENANT TAO, THE SYRINGE THAT
WE FOUND AT THE CRIME SCENE --

11:32.192 --> 11:33.894
DO YOU HAVE IT
ON YOUR DESK?

11:33.927 --> 11:35.996
IT SHOULD HAVE A LOT NUMBER.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.231
WHAT IS IT?

11:38.265 --> 11:39.867
SIX...

11:39.900 --> 11:43.136
JACKSON, CHARLIE, BRAVO,

11:43.170 --> 11:45.438
ONE, "DASH," NANCY...

11:45.472 --> 11:47.440
DELTA, CHARLIE,

11:47.474 --> 11:49.777
ZERO-SIX-ZERO-THREE.

11:49.810 --> 11:51.344
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.359
IS IT THE SAME?

12:06.393 --> 12:09.396
NO, MA'AM.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.965
THE SYRINGE THAT WE FOUND
AT THE HOTEL

12:11.999 --> 12:14.868
DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE COME
FROM THE VICTIM'S APARTMENT.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.005
I KNEW IT WASN'T HERS.

12:18.038 --> 12:19.172
I KNEW IT.

12:24.444 --> 12:28.015
SO, WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT
THE NEEDLE THAT KILLED HER?

12:28.048 --> 12:30.117
OTHER THAN THE FACT
THAT IT WASN'T HERS.

12:30.150 --> 12:32.385
Flynn: WELL, THERE ARE
TRACES OF HIGH-GRADE
HEROIN FOUND INSIDE.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.087
IT'S CALLED "CHINA WHITE"
ON THE STREET.

12:34.121 --> 12:37.090
YEAH, THAT STUFF'S RARE
ON THE WEST COAST.

12:37.124 --> 12:40.994
SEDONA GIBSON HAD NO RECORD
AND NO HISTORY OF DRUG ABUSE.

12:41.028 --> 12:43.096
HER APARTMENT WAS CLEAN --

12:43.130 --> 12:46.166
NO EVIDENCE OF ALCOHOL, DRUGS,
OR RELATED PARAPHERNALIA.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.334
AND EXCEPT FOR INSULIN,

12:47.367 --> 12:48.802
NOT EVEN PRESCRIPTIONS.

12:48.836 --> 12:51.138
NO AMBIEN?
SHOWED UP ON HER TOX SCREEN.

12:51.171 --> 12:54.975
CHIEF, WORKING THROUGH SEDONA'S
SHARPS CONTAINER,

12:55.008 --> 12:57.510
I'VE TESTED
27 USED SYRINGES --

12:57.544 --> 12:59.112
ALL COME BACK CLEAN
FOR OPIATES.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.513
Brenda: OKAY,
SO SHE WASN'T A HEROIN ADDICT,

13:00.547 --> 13:02.149
BUT SHE DID DIE
OF AN OVERDOSE.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.984
SO WE HAVE TO CONSIDER
THE POSSIBILITY

13:04.017 --> 13:05.986
THAT SOMEONE TALKED HER
INTO TRYING HEROIN.

13:06.019 --> 13:08.321
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HER...

13:08.355 --> 13:10.423
"DATE" THAT NIGHT?

13:10.457 --> 13:12.292
WELL, I LOOKED INTO THE BILLING
ON THE HOTEL ROOM,

13:12.325 --> 13:14.361
AND IT TURNS OUT IT WAS PAID FOR
BY A COMPANY CALLED...

13:14.394 --> 13:16.029
DYNAMIC GOODS,

13:16.063 --> 13:18.031
WHICH IS BASICALLY
A FRONT

13:18.065 --> 13:20.167
FOR AN ESCORT SERVICE
CALLED FOUR ACES MODELS.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.602
"DYNAMIC GOODS"
SOUNDS AMBIGUOUS ENOUGH

13:22.635 --> 13:24.071
NOT TO LOOK SUSPICIOUS

13:24.104 --> 13:25.072
ON A MARRIED MAN'S
CREDIT CARD.

13:25.105 --> 13:26.073
WAIT, LIEUTENANT.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.607
CHIEF, I'M SORRY.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.277
THE MORGUE WAS ONE THING,
BUT...

13:30.310 --> 13:32.812
DETECTIVE ORTEGA --
SHE SHOULDN'T BE HERE FOR THIS.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.949
I CAN HANDLE IT.

13:35.983 --> 13:37.985
SAY WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.120
OKAY.

13:40.153 --> 13:44.524
FOUR ACES MODELS --
THEY...

13:44.557 --> 13:46.226
CATER TO A RICH CLIENTELE.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.095
THE RATES
START AT $1,200,

13:48.128 --> 13:50.163
AND THEY SKYROCKET
FROM THERE.

13:50.197 --> 13:52.499
NOW, THE FEE IS ALL INCLUSIVE
AND COVERS THE HOTEL ROOM.

13:52.532 --> 13:55.635
THE COMPANY'S BASED
HERE IN LOS ANGELES

13:55.668 --> 13:57.938
AND OWNED BY A WOMAN
NAMED LINDA PRALL.

13:57.971 --> 14:00.007
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA
JUST PICKED HER UP.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.241
SHE CALLED HER ATTORNEY

14:01.274 --> 14:02.943
THE MOMENT HE WALKED
THROUGH THE DOOR,

14:02.976 --> 14:04.544
SO HER LAWYER WILL BE
JOINING HER.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.180
IS MY DAUGHTER...

14:08.581 --> 14:10.150
...ON THAT WEBSITE?

14:13.620 --> 14:15.188
I, UH...

14:15.222 --> 14:18.025
THINK THEY MUST HAVE
TAKEN HER PICTURE DOWN.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.328
SEDONA WAS IN VEGAS?

14:21.361 --> 14:22.295
Sanchez: YES, MA'AM --
LAST WEEKEND.

14:22.329 --> 14:23.530
WE FOUND THAT PLANE TICKET

14:23.563 --> 14:25.165
ALONG WITH SOME
$100 CASINO CHIPS.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.234
ALSO, THERE'S
THIS NOTE INSIDE.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.269
AND I THINK IT'S WRITTEN
IN RUSSIAN,

14:29.302 --> 14:30.370
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN.

14:30.403 --> 14:31.504
CAN YOU TRANSLATE, CHIEF?

14:31.538 --> 14:33.006
UH...

14:33.040 --> 14:35.608
BASICALLY IT JUST SAYS,
"YOU WERE FANTASTIC.

14:35.642 --> 14:37.077
THANK YOU.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.979
DEMITRI ANDROPOV."

14:40.013 --> 14:42.315
Gabriel:
SO, UH, SHE...

14:42.349 --> 14:43.917
WAS THERE ON A JOB.

14:43.951 --> 14:45.518
I'M ASSUMING
THAT'S THE CASE, YES.

14:45.552 --> 14:48.188
WOULD YOU FIND OUT IF
AGENT HOWARD IS IN THE BUILDING?

14:48.221 --> 14:49.356
I'D LIKE HIM TO JOIN ME

14:49.389 --> 14:51.058
IN MY INTERVIEW
WITH LINDA PRALL.

14:51.091 --> 14:53.360
THANK YOU.
PARDON ME, GENTLEMEN.

14:54.627 --> 14:57.397
MRS. PRALL,
I ASSUME YOU'RE AWARE

14:57.430 --> 14:59.132
THAT ONE OF
YOUR EMPLOYEES,

14:59.166 --> 15:01.034
AN ESCORT NAMED
SEDONA GIBSON,

15:01.068 --> 15:03.370
WAS RECENTLY FOUND DEAD
IN A HOTEL ROOM

15:03.403 --> 15:05.305
PAID FOR
BY YOUR ESCORT SERVICE.

15:05.338 --> 15:08.208
EXCUSE ME. MRS. PRALL RUNS
A MODELING AGENCY.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.477
ANY SUGGESTION TO THE CONTRARY,
AND WE'RE GONNA WALK.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.079
LET'S NOT GET OFF
ON THE WRONG FOOT.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.413
I JUST HAVE
A FEW QUESTIONS.

15:13.446 --> 15:14.982
WHY IS THE FBI HERE?

15:15.015 --> 15:16.449
'CAUSE IF MRS. PRALL
DOESN'T ANSWER CHIEF JOHNSON,

15:16.483 --> 15:17.617
I INTEND TO TAKE HER
INTO CUSTODY.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.052
WHAT CHARGE?

15:19.086 --> 15:21.288
HOW ABOUT
INTERSTATE PROSTITUTION?

15:25.192 --> 15:26.593
SEDONA GIBSON.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.361
WORKED FOR YOU
IN LOS ANGELES,

15:28.395 --> 15:30.430
BUT YOU ALSO BOOKED HER TO
ENTERTAIN A CLIENT IN LAS VEGAS,

15:30.463 --> 15:32.432
JUST A FEW DAYS
BEFORE SHE DIED.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.301
FOUR ACES MODELS

15:34.334 --> 15:36.236
HAS A STRICT NO-SEX POLICY.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.438
ANY ACTIVITY BETWEEN
TWO CONSENTING ADULTS

15:38.471 --> 15:39.572
IS A PRIVATE MATTER.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.574
WOULD DEMITRI ANDROPOV

15:41.608 --> 15:44.978
BE ONE OF YOUR
CONSENTING ADULTS?

15:45.012 --> 15:46.679
Fritz: THE FBI WILL SUBPOENA
MRS. PRALL'S BUSINESS RECORDS.

15:46.713 --> 15:49.682
WE WILL FIND THE ANSWERS
TO CHIEF JOHNSON'S QUESTIONS,

15:49.716 --> 15:52.052
OR WE CAN JUST CHAT ABOUT IT
IN HERE.

15:59.759 --> 16:01.228
SEDONA WAS A GOOD GIRL.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.096
IT'S A SHAME
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER.

16:03.130 --> 16:06.099
HOW LONG HAD SHE BEEN WORKING
FOR YOU?

16:06.133 --> 16:08.335
MAYBE A YEAR?

16:08.368 --> 16:09.736
BUT IT WAS A PART-TIME THING
FOR HER.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.304
SHE WAS GOING BACK
TO SCHOOL,

16:11.338 --> 16:12.705
GETTING HER LIFE
ON TRACK.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.774
WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME
ABOUT SEDONA'S LAST DATE

16:14.807 --> 16:16.343
ON THE NIGHT SHE DIED?

16:16.376 --> 16:18.178
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS.

16:18.211 --> 16:20.347
HEY, HOW BIG DO YOU WANT
THIS INVESTIGATION TO BE?

16:23.116 --> 16:24.684
HE WAS A FIRST-TIMER.

16:24.717 --> 16:28.155
DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
HOW THINGS WORK.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.389
HIS NAME?

16:29.422 --> 16:32.625
I DON'T, UM --
I DON'T REMEMBER...

16:32.659 --> 16:34.127
OFFHAND.

16:34.161 --> 16:36.729
BUT YOU WILL FIND OUT
FOR US.

16:36.763 --> 16:39.099
IF WE CAN AGREE THAT
THAT INFORMATION

16:39.132 --> 16:41.301
WILL NOT BE USED
TO PROSECUTE MY CLIENT.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.436
WOULDN'T DREAM OF IT.

16:43.470 --> 16:47.074
ANY IDEA WHY SEDONA CAME TO WORK
FOR YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE?

16:47.107 --> 16:48.408
HER HUSBAND, DREW.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.043
THEY WERE STRUGGLING,
BROKE.

16:50.077 --> 16:52.079
HE WAS AN ADDICT,
THAT SORT OF THING.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.614
WHAT ABOUT SEDONA?
DID SHE USE?

16:54.647 --> 16:57.084
NO.
WELL, NOT THAT I KNOW OF.

16:57.117 --> 17:00.287
SHE WAS JUST DESPERATE
TO BE LOVED, YOU KNOW?

17:00.320 --> 17:01.721
TO BE NEEDED.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.056
SHE WOULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING
FOR DREW.

17:03.090 --> 17:04.457
SHE EVEN MADE
A COUPLE OF FILMS

17:04.491 --> 17:06.226
A FEW MONTHS BACK
BECAUSE HE WANTED HER TO.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.328
PORNOGRAPHY?
ADULT FILMS.

17:08.361 --> 17:11.364
HE TALKED HER
INTO DOING THEM

17:11.398 --> 17:14.801
BECAUSE THEY RAISE A MODEL'S
HOURLY QUOTE.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.403
MADE HER MORE VALUABLE.

17:16.436 --> 17:18.171
THE THING IS,
AFTER SHE DID THEM,

17:18.205 --> 17:19.272
THE BASTARD
KICKED HER OUT.

17:19.306 --> 17:20.307
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?

17:20.340 --> 17:22.175
MESSED HER UP PRETTY GOOD.

17:22.209 --> 17:25.745
SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS TRYING
TO GET AHOLD OF HER FAMILY.

17:27.614 --> 17:29.482
BUT BAD BLOOD THERE, I GUESS.

17:29.516 --> 17:32.285
IT'S NOT LIKE
ANY OF THESE GIRLS

17:32.319 --> 17:33.686
COME FROM HAPPY HOMES.

17:33.720 --> 17:37.724
SO, SHE WAS ALL ALONE
IN THE WORLD...

17:37.757 --> 17:40.827
EXCEPT FOR ME,
AND...I CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH.

17:40.860 --> 17:43.296
YEAH, YOU'RE A REGULAR
MOTHER TERESA.

17:43.330 --> 17:44.464
HEY...

17:44.497 --> 17:47.300
IT IS AN UGLY WORLD
OUT THERE,

17:47.334 --> 17:48.668
AND I AM NOT THE ONE
WHO MISTREATED HER.

17:48.701 --> 17:51.271
THAT WAS HER HUSBAND,
AFTER HE KICKED HER OUT,

17:51.304 --> 17:53.306
COMING AROUND AGAIN
ASKING FOR MORE MONEY.

17:53.340 --> 17:55.242
WHERE IS HE NOW

17:55.275 --> 17:58.211
SHE TOLD ME HE WAS CRASHING
WITH SOME LOW-LIFE --

17:58.245 --> 17:59.246
"BLAZER," I THINK.

17:59.279 --> 18:00.813
BUT I-I DON'T KNOW.

18:00.847 --> 18:01.848
JESSE BLAZER.

18:01.881 --> 18:03.583
A DRUG DEALER
IN PHOENIX.

18:03.616 --> 18:04.817
I ARRESTED HIM TWICE.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.353
HEY, WHY WOULD DREW
KILL HER?

18:06.386 --> 18:09.122
THE GIRL WAS PAYING HIM
TO LEAVE HER ALONE.

18:14.261 --> 18:16.729
CHIEF, I GOT AN ADDRESS
ON SEDONA'S CELL

18:16.763 --> 18:18.798
FOR A JESSE BLAZER.

18:18.831 --> 18:21.268
LET'S GO TALK TO HIM.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.770
UH, DETECTIVE ORTEGA,
BEFORE YOU ASK,

18:23.803 --> 18:25.438
IT WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE
FOR YOU TO JOIN US.

18:25.472 --> 18:27.507
UH, AGENT HOWARD,

18:27.540 --> 18:29.376
WOULD YOU PLEASE FOLLOW UP
WITH MRS. PRALL

18:29.409 --> 18:31.211
ON THE IDENTITY
OF SEDONA'S LAST JOHN?

18:31.244 --> 18:32.879
I DON'T WANT HER TO GET BUSY
AND FORGET.

18:32.912 --> 18:34.214
I'LL GET HIS NAME
AND PAY HIM A VISIT.

19:09.216 --> 19:10.450
AFTERNOON.

19:10.483 --> 19:11.784
I'M DEPUTY CHIEF JOHNSON.

19:11.818 --> 19:12.819
L.A.P.D.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.188
Sanchez: STOP, STOP!

19:15.222 --> 19:17.457
WE HAVE A RUNNER!

19:18.725 --> 19:21.361
PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR!

19:21.394 --> 19:22.362
DO IT!

19:22.395 --> 19:23.496
YOU --

19:23.530 --> 19:25.365
GET YOUR HAND
OFF THE GUN --

19:25.398 --> 19:26.399
NOW!

19:27.334 --> 19:28.535
CHIEF!

19:31.438 --> 19:33.373
COME ON!

20:04.871 --> 20:06.873
WE'RE DONE IN HERE!
GUYS!

20:08.675 --> 20:11.378
LONNIE HARRIS.
ARE YOU DREW GIBSON?

20:11.411 --> 20:12.745
ARE YOU DREW GIBSON?!

20:12.779 --> 20:14.647
DID YOU KNOW SEDONA GIBSON?

20:14.681 --> 20:16.549
DID YOU KNOW SEDONA GIBSON?!

20:16.583 --> 20:17.984
KNEW SHE WAS A WHORE.

20:22.889 --> 20:23.790
DAMN IT!

20:27.294 --> 20:28.795
THANK YOU.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.029
EVERYBODY OKAY?

20:30.062 --> 20:31.531
YEAH. I'M GOOD.
LIEUTENANT

20:31.564 --> 20:34.434
UH, WELL, I FEEL TERRIBLE
ABOUT THE FISH,

20:34.467 --> 20:36.269
BUT, UH,
I'LL CRY LATER.

20:36.303 --> 20:37.704
RIGHT NOW,
WE'VE GOT TO...

20:37.737 --> 20:39.572
WE'VE GOT TO FIND
THEIR NEEDLES

20:39.606 --> 20:41.541
BEFORE PATROL DRAGS US
OUT OF HERE.

20:41.574 --> 20:44.811
NEEDLES OR SOMETHING THAT
TIES THEM TO SEDONA'S DEATH.

20:44.844 --> 20:47.480
CHIEF,
THIS IS WHAT KILLED HER.

20:47.514 --> 20:50.617
WHITE HEROIN.
AND THEY GOT A LOT OF IT.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.652
BURNERS LIKE THESE GUYS -- THEY
USUALLY DON'T HAVE THE DOUGH

20:52.685 --> 20:54.854
FOR TOP-GRADE STUFF
LIKE THIS.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.425
SERGEANT.
DETECTIVE DAVID GABRIEL.

20:58.458 --> 20:59.959
MAJOR CRIMES.

20:59.992 --> 21:01.661
THE HOUSE IS SECURE.

21:01.694 --> 21:02.795
THERE ARE NO
OUTSTANDING SUSPECTS,

21:02.829 --> 21:03.896
AND THERE ARE
OFFICERS INVOLVED.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.065
GOT IT.
UH, CHIEF JOHNSON?

21:06.098 --> 21:07.634
I HAVE TO ASK YOU
AND YOUR DETECTIVES TO
STEP OUTSIDE, PLEASE.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.035
OF COURSE, YEAH.

21:09.068 --> 21:11.471
W-WE'LL BE RIGHT OUT.
WE'RE LEAVING RIGHT NOW.

21:14.006 --> 21:15.475
CHIEF.
HUH?

21:15.508 --> 21:16.509
CHIEF, WE GOT TO GO.

21:16.543 --> 21:19.379
WE GOT TO GO.

21:32.859 --> 21:34.026
CHIEF JOHNSON.

21:35.695 --> 21:37.530
DETECTIVE GABRIEL TELLS ME
YOU HAD A VERY CLOSE CALL.

21:37.564 --> 21:40.066
NOT SERIOUS.

21:40.099 --> 21:41.834
STILL YOU MUST BE
A LITTLE RATTLED.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.536
WHY AREN'T YOU DOWNTOWN?

21:43.570 --> 21:45.538
YOUR INTERVIEW WITH THE F.I.D.
TAKES PLACE RIGHT AWAY.

21:45.572 --> 21:46.973
I NEVER DISCHARGED
MY WEAPON.

21:47.006 --> 21:49.041
GOOD.

21:49.075 --> 21:51.678
AT LEAST YOU WON'T BE
THE SUBJECT OF ANOTHER LAWSUIT.

21:51.711 --> 21:53.480
DAY'S NOT OVER YET.

21:53.513 --> 21:56.549
I NEED TO GET BACK
IN THAT HOUSE.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.017
F.I.D. HAS IT
FOR 48 HOURS.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.419
THEN IT'S ALL YOURS.

21:59.452 --> 22:00.753
DETECTIVE ORTEGA IS WAITING
IN MY OFFICE

22:00.787 --> 22:02.622
TO FIND OUT IF WE FOUND
HER DAUGHTER'S MURDERER.

22:02.655 --> 22:05.124
SOMETHING IN THE HOUSE
HELPED YOU CONFIRM THAT?

22:05.157 --> 22:06.793
THERE MIGHT BE SOME NEEDLES
WITH THE LOT NUMBER

22:06.826 --> 22:08.495
THAT MATCHES WHAT WE FOUND
IN OUR VICTIM'S ARM.

22:08.528 --> 22:11.097
HOW BADLY DO YOU WANT
THE NEEDLES?

22:12.832 --> 22:15.067
IF I WERE TO FIND THEM
OR SOMETHING ELSE

22:15.101 --> 22:16.969
THAT WOULD HELP YOU
MAKE YOUR CASE,

22:17.003 --> 22:18.638
PERHAPS YOU COULD CONVINCE
DETECTIVE SANCHEZ

22:18.671 --> 22:19.806
TO ALLOW ME
TO INTERVIEW HIM --

22:19.839 --> 22:21.040
YOU'RE BLACKMAILING ME?

22:21.073 --> 22:23.009
YOU HAVE THE IDEA -- YES.

22:26.613 --> 22:29.382
FIND THE NEEDLES.
WE'LL TALK.

22:36.889 --> 22:38.958
EXCUSE ME. SORRY.
THANK YOU.

22:38.991 --> 22:40.493
HI.

22:40.527 --> 22:42.128
HEY.

22:44.531 --> 22:45.898
HOW ARE YOU?
FINE.

22:45.932 --> 22:48.034
CAREFUL.
I SMELL LIKE A FISH TANK.

22:48.067 --> 22:50.670
YOU SMELL GREAT.
AND ALIVE.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.705
I HOPE I BROUGHT
THE RIGHT DRESS.

22:52.739 --> 22:54.874
I'M SURE IT'S FINE. THANK YOU.

22:54.907 --> 22:56.476
WHAT'S GOING ON?

22:56.509 --> 22:58.578
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO SORT THROUGH THIS NOW.

22:58.611 --> 23:00.046
I DON'T --

23:00.079 --> 23:03.850
WHAT'D YOU FIND OUT
ABOUT SEDONA'S LAST JOHN?

23:03.883 --> 23:05.785
YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO DO THIS?

23:05.818 --> 23:07.454
I DO. I DO.
LET'S KEEP GOING.

23:07.487 --> 23:08.821
OKAY.

23:08.855 --> 23:10.890
SEDONA'S LAST JOHN IS A GUY
NAMED SPENCER PITTMAN.

23:10.923 --> 23:12.124
HE'S MARRIED,
HE'S GOT A KID.

23:12.158 --> 23:13.092
HE SAID HE BOOKED SEDONA
FOR THAT NIGHT

23:13.125 --> 23:14.193
BUT THEN GOT COLD FEET

23:14.226 --> 23:15.662
AND NEVER SHOWED UP.

23:15.695 --> 23:17.764
PULLED A LATE NIGHT
AT WORK INSTEAD.

23:17.797 --> 23:19.532
DID YOU CONFIRM
HIS STORY?

23:19.566 --> 23:21.501
YEAH, YEAH,
WITH THREE OF HIS COWORKERS.

23:21.534 --> 23:23.536
OKAY.
LET ME PUT THIS DRESS ON...

23:23.570 --> 23:25.772
BEFORE SOMETHING ELSE
HAPPENS.

23:25.805 --> 23:26.873
THERE YOU ARE.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.174
I-I HAVE SOMETHING
FOR YOU.

23:29.609 --> 23:30.943
EVENING, AGENT HOWARD.

23:30.977 --> 23:32.011
Fritz: CAPTAIN.

23:33.946 --> 23:36.849
DON'T BE HERE ALL NIGHT.

23:36.883 --> 23:37.884
OKAY.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.659
YOU FOUND THEIR NEEDLES?

23:46.693 --> 23:48.561
WITH THEIR AMBIEN -- YES.

23:48.595 --> 23:51.464
OH, SEDONA'S TOX SCREEN
CAME BACK POSITIVE FOR --
FOR AMBIEN.

23:51.498 --> 23:53.500
AND JUDGING BY THE ENVELOPE
I FOUND THEM IN,

23:53.533 --> 23:54.867
I AM PRETTY SURE

23:54.901 --> 23:56.536
THAT THESE ARE NOT PART OF
AN ACTUAL PRESCRIPTION.

23:56.569 --> 23:58.738
SO...

23:58.771 --> 24:00.807
I'VE KEPT UP MY END
OF THE BARGAIN,

24:00.840 --> 24:03.510
AND NOW I'D LIKE TO SPEAK
TO DETECTIVE SANCHEZ.

24:03.543 --> 24:05.177
WE'RE STILL ON
HIS F.I.D. INTERVIEW.

24:05.211 --> 24:06.979
ALL RIGHT, WELL, I'LL WAIT
FOR HIM IN YOUR CONFERENCE ROOM.

24:08.548 --> 24:09.582
THANK YOU.

24:09.616 --> 24:10.750
YOU'RE WELCOME.

24:16.989 --> 24:18.725
IT SHOULD TAKE ABOUT AN HOUR

24:18.758 --> 24:20.259
TO PROCESS THIS ENVELOPE
FOR PRINTS.

24:20.292 --> 24:23.029
BUT THESE NEEDLES
THAT CAPTAIN RAYDOR FOUND --

24:23.062 --> 24:25.164
THEY HAVE THE SAME
LOT SUPPLY NUMBER

24:25.197 --> 24:27.600
AS THE ONE THAT KILLED
SEDONA GIBSON.

24:27.634 --> 24:29.201
IT WAS DREW.
I WAS RIGHT.

24:29.235 --> 24:31.070
HE MURDERED MY DAUGHTER.

24:31.103 --> 24:34.774
Taylor:
LOOK, WE KNOW DREW GIBSON
WAS INVOLVED IN SOME WAY,

24:34.807 --> 24:37.844
BUT THERE'S STILL NO
DEFINITIVE PROOF OF HOMICIDE.

24:37.877 --> 24:39.746
I MEAN, SEDONA COULD HAVE
INVITED HER HUSBAND

24:39.779 --> 24:41.280
TO THAT HOTEL ROOM.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.915
HOW ELSE WOULD HE HAVE KNOWN
THAT SHE WAS THERE ALONE?

24:42.949 --> 24:44.517
DETECTIVE,
THE COMMANDER'S RIGHT.

24:44.551 --> 24:46.185
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
EVIDENCE YET TO CLOSE THIS CASE.

24:46.218 --> 24:47.520
EXCUSE ME.

24:49.155 --> 24:52.024
HOLLYWOOD RAN A DNA TEST
ON SEDONA GIBSON

24:52.058 --> 24:53.693
BEFORE THEY I.D.'d HER.

24:53.726 --> 24:54.994
AND THE RESULTS CAME BACK,

24:55.027 --> 24:56.262
AND WE'VE GOT A DEFINITE HIT
ON HER FATHER.

24:56.295 --> 24:59.766
ARRESTED ON A EMBEZZLEMENT
CHARGE IN '92.

24:59.799 --> 25:01.033
BUT HE DIDN'T LIVE
IN PHOENIX.

25:01.067 --> 25:02.301
IN FACT, TILL RECENTLY,

25:02.334 --> 25:03.770
HE WAS A RESIDENT
RIGHT HERE IN L.A.

25:03.803 --> 25:05.104
UNTIL RECENTLY?

25:05.137 --> 25:07.907
YEAH. SEDONA'S FATHER DIED
SIX MONTHS AGO.

25:07.940 --> 25:10.977
A GUY NAMED
RANDOLPH PITTMAN.

25:14.847 --> 25:17.884
DETECTIVE ORTEGA?

25:17.917 --> 25:19.952
WHO'S RANDOLPH PITTMAN?

25:19.986 --> 25:22.221
RANDOLPH PITTMAN?

25:22.254 --> 25:24.023
I DON'T KNOW.
WHY?

25:24.056 --> 25:26.158
ACCORDING TO SEDONA'S DNA TEST,
HE WAS HER FATHER.

25:28.695 --> 25:29.962
OH, I SEE.

25:31.631 --> 25:32.899
SEDONA WAS ADOPTED.

25:34.100 --> 25:36.569
WHEN SHE WAS THREE MONTHS OLD.

25:36.603 --> 25:38.971
IT'S SOMETHING I NEVER THINK
ABOUT OUTSIDE A DOCTOR'S OFFICE.

25:39.005 --> 25:41.340
IS IT...

25:41.373 --> 25:43.109
I

25:43.142 --> 25:46.212
IT WASN'T INFORMATION THAT
I WAS TRYING TO WITHHOLD --

25:46.245 --> 25:47.046
OKAY.

25:50.617 --> 25:54.987
MRS. PRALL TOLD ME THAT SEDONA
WAS LOOKING FOR HER FAMILY.

25:55.021 --> 25:56.989
I ASSUMED SHE WAS TALKING
ABOUT YOU, BUT...

25:57.023 --> 25:58.958
SHE KNEW WHERE YOU WERE --
SHE CALLED YOU RECENTLY.

26:02.762 --> 26:04.330
RANDOLPH PITTMAN.

26:04.363 --> 26:07.667
THE NAME OF SEDONA'S LAST JOHN.

26:07.700 --> 26:10.336
HIS LAST WAS PITTMAN, TOO,
WASN'T IT?

26:10.369 --> 26:11.938
YEAH.

26:11.971 --> 26:13.906
SPENCER. PITTMAN.

26:13.940 --> 26:16.643
SO, SEDONA WAS LOOKING FOR
HER BIOLOGIC FAMILY.

26:16.676 --> 26:18.144
LOOKS LIKE SHE FOUND THEM.

26:18.177 --> 26:20.880
OKAY, UH, LIEUTENANT,
FIND OUT WHAT YOU CAN

26:20.913 --> 26:22.815
ABOUT SPENCER PITTMAN,

26:22.849 --> 26:24.617
AND BRING HIM IN
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, PLEASE.

27:00.252 --> 27:02.989
SO, LATER YOU WERE IN THE CAR
WITH CHIEF JOHNSON

27:03.022 --> 27:04.724
AND DETECTIVE GABRIEL

27:04.757 --> 27:07.694
WHEN THE THREE OF YOU
TOOK TURELL BAYLOR TO HIS HOUSE.

27:07.727 --> 27:08.995
WAS THERE ANY CONVERSATION

27:09.028 --> 27:10.296
ON THE WAY TO
THE SUSPECT'S HOME?
YES.

27:10.329 --> 27:13.132
THE CHIEF OFFERED BAYLOR
AN OPPORTUNITY

27:13.165 --> 27:14.901
TO REVOKE HIS IMMUNITY DEAL
AND CONFESS

27:14.934 --> 27:16.302
TO THE SHOOTIN' NEWTON
MURDERS.

27:16.335 --> 27:18.070
WHAT'D TURELL SAY?

27:18.104 --> 27:20.239
ABOUT REVOKING HIS IMMUNITY
AGREEMENT -- HE SAID NO.

27:20.272 --> 27:22.274
DO YOU THINK THE CHIEF WOULD
HAVE LET HIM OUT OF THE CAR

27:22.308 --> 27:23.409
IF HE'D SAID YES?

27:27.113 --> 27:30.950
WHEN YOU ARRIVED
AT MR. BAYLOR'S HOUSE,

27:30.983 --> 27:33.319
DID YOU HAVE ANY REASON TO
BELIEVE THAT HE WAS IN DANGER?

27:33.352 --> 27:35.087
IT'S A BAD NEIGHBORHOOD.

27:35.121 --> 27:36.455
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.390
YES.

27:38.424 --> 27:41.393
BUT WAS THERE ANY SIGN
OF A SPECIFIC THREAT

27:41.427 --> 27:43.129
TOWARDS MR. BAYLOR,

27:43.162 --> 27:46.465
FOR EXAMPLE,
GANG MEMBERS HANGING AROUND?

27:46.498 --> 27:47.934
IF THEY WERE GANG MEMBERS,

27:47.967 --> 27:49.268
THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN 110 CRIPS,
LIKE BAYLOR.

27:49.301 --> 27:51.070
AND NOBODY HAD A PROBLEM
DROPPING OFF MR. BAYLOR

27:51.103 --> 27:52.204
WITH POTENTIAL
CRIPS THERE?

27:52.238 --> 27:55.174
I DID NOT HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH IT.

27:55.207 --> 27:58.177
DO YOU REMEMBER
IF DETECTIVE GABRIEL

27:58.210 --> 27:59.912
VOICED ANY CONCERN?

27:59.946 --> 28:02.348
NO.
NO, HE DIDN'T VOICE
A CONCERN,

28:02.381 --> 28:04.150
OR, NO,
YOU DON'T REMEMBER?

28:04.183 --> 28:08.087
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I REMEMBER, CAPTAIN?

28:08.120 --> 28:10.056
YES.

28:10.089 --> 28:12.124
I REMEMBER...

28:12.158 --> 28:16.262
TURELL BAYLOR MURDERED...

28:16.295 --> 28:18.765
A 74-YEAR-OLD MAN

28:18.798 --> 28:23.435
AND SHOT HIS 8-YEAR-OLD GRANDSON
IN THE HEAD.

28:28.074 --> 28:30.509
I'M FOGGY ON THE REST.

28:30.542 --> 28:31.911
SORRY.

28:31.944 --> 28:34.914
Flynn: OH, HEY, CHIEF.

28:34.947 --> 28:36.215
SPENCER PITTMAN IS IN 1.

28:36.248 --> 28:37.917
I READ HIM HIS RIGHTS,

28:37.950 --> 28:40.853
AND I TOLD HIM THAT WE WERE
LOOKING INTO FOUR ACES MODELS.

28:40.887 --> 28:42.221
Gabriel:
BUT HIS ALIBI IS ROCK SOLID

28:42.254 --> 28:43.455
ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER.

28:43.489 --> 28:45.191
HE NEVER SET FOOT
IN THAT HOTEL ROOM.

28:45.224 --> 28:46.425
NOW, I DID GO THROUGH
HIS FINANCES,

28:46.458 --> 28:48.260
AND I FOUND
A CASH WITHDRAWAL

28:48.294 --> 28:52.131
FOR $50,000 FROM ONE OF HIS
PERSONAL ACCOUNTS 10 DAYS AGO.

28:52.164 --> 28:53.365
AND ACCORDING TO F.I.D.,

28:53.399 --> 28:54.867
THE NET WEIGHT
OF THE UNCUT HEROIN

28:54.901 --> 28:56.302
COLLECTED AT
YOUR SHOOTOUT TODAY

28:56.335 --> 28:58.504
WOULD HAVE COST
THE DEALERS

28:58.537 --> 29:01.140
APPROXIMATELY -- WAIT FOR IT --
$50,000.

29:01.173 --> 29:03.442
DO WE KNOW
IF HE HAS A MOTIVE?

29:03.475 --> 29:05.011
WELL, SPENCER'S FATHER

29:05.044 --> 29:06.412
WAS A PRETTY SUCCESSFUL
INVESTMENT BROKER.

29:06.445 --> 29:09.115
WHEN HE DIED, HE WAS WORTH
OVER $100 MILLION.

29:09.148 --> 29:10.850
Flynn:
HERE'S A COPY

29:10.883 --> 29:12.518
OF HIS FATHER'S
LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT,

29:12.551 --> 29:15.321
WHICH STATES THAT HIS ASSETS
ARE TO BE DIVIDED EVENLY

29:15.354 --> 29:17.123
AMONG HIS KIDS,

29:17.156 --> 29:18.858
WHICH,
BEFORE SEDONA SHOWED UP,

29:18.891 --> 29:21.160
CONSISTED OF SPENCER PITTMAN
AND HIS OLDER BROTHER, BENNETT.

29:21.193 --> 29:24.096
Ortega: I KNEW SEDONA'S BIRTH
FATHER LIVED IN L.A. COUNTY,

29:24.130 --> 29:25.297
AND I TOLD HER THAT.

29:25.331 --> 29:26.398
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW
SHE FOLLOWED THROUGH

29:26.432 --> 29:27.934
ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

29:27.967 --> 29:29.068
Pope: MEDICAL ISSUES
HAVE MADE IT MUCH EASIER

29:29.101 --> 29:30.903
TO OPEN ADOPTION RECORDS.

29:30.937 --> 29:33.539
LET'S SAY YOUR DAUGHTER FOUND
OUT WHO HER BIRTH FAMILY WAS

29:33.572 --> 29:37.844
AND KNEW THAT SHE WAS IN LINE
TO INHERIT TENS OF MILLIONS...

29:37.877 --> 29:39.311
APPROXIMATELY $33 MILLION.

29:39.345 --> 29:41.147
WELL,
THERE'S SPENCER'S MOTIVE.

29:41.180 --> 29:42.448
HE DIDN'T WANT TO PAY UP.

29:42.481 --> 29:44.016
Gabriel:
OH. AND GET THIS.

29:44.050 --> 29:45.885
PITTMAN'S GOT A PRESCRIPTION
FOR AMBIEN.

29:45.918 --> 29:48.020
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
SO WAIT A MINUTE.

29:48.054 --> 29:50.456
HOW YOU GONNA
TURN $50,000

29:50.489 --> 29:53.225
AND AN ENVELOPE OF AMBIEN
INTO A MURDER CHARGE?

29:53.259 --> 29:55.828
YOUR SUSPECT WASN'T ANYWHERE
NEAR THE SCENE,

29:55.862 --> 29:57.496
AND HIS ALLEGED ACCOMPLICE
IS DEAD.

29:57.529 --> 30:00.132
WELL, I'LL ASK MR. PITTMAN
SOME QUESTIONS

30:00.166 --> 30:01.968
AND SEE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.

30:05.404 --> 30:07.406
H-HOW DID IT GO
WITH CAPTAIN RAYDOR?

30:07.439 --> 30:09.976
CHIEF...

30:10.009 --> 30:11.911
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT WE HAD ANYTHING TO DO

30:11.944 --> 30:13.345
WITH TURELL BAYLOR
GETTING KILLED?

30:13.379 --> 30:16.382
WE DIDN'T.

30:16.415 --> 30:18.084
HE SHOWED UP HERE
LOOKING FOR PROTECTION

30:18.117 --> 30:19.618
BECAUSE HIS OWN GANG
WAS SHOOTING AT HIM.

30:19.651 --> 30:22.354
SO IT DIDN'T MATTER
WHERE WE LET HIM GO --

30:22.388 --> 30:23.890
BAYLOR WAS A DEAD MAN.

30:23.923 --> 30:26.492
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT.

30:26.525 --> 30:28.527
JULIO, I DON'T --
I DON'T KNOW.

30:29.896 --> 30:31.197
THERE ARE GAPS
IN THE RECORD --

30:31.230 --> 30:32.198
GAPS?

30:32.231 --> 30:33.465
CHIEF...

30:33.499 --> 30:36.235
LET ME FILL IN
A GAP FOR YOU.

30:36.268 --> 30:38.470
TURELL BAYLOR COMMITTED
A DOUBLE HOMICIDE

30:38.504 --> 30:41.874
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO PAY
FOR A BEER.

30:41.908 --> 30:44.176
SO LET'S SAY
THAT WE LET HIM GO...

30:45.077 --> 30:48.047
...and somehow he doesn't
get offed by his friends.

30:48.080 --> 30:49.882
AND A DAY, WEEK,
MONTH LATER,

30:49.916 --> 30:51.583
WE'RE KNEELING OVER
SOMEONE ELSE

30:51.617 --> 30:53.219
THAT TURELL BAYLOR'S
SHOT TO DEATH

30:53.252 --> 30:54.921
AND EXPLAINING
TO FAMILY MEMBERS

30:54.954 --> 30:58.190
WHY WE LET A CONFESSED MURDERER
OUT ON THE STREET.

30:58.224 --> 31:00.927
AND WE'D PROBABLY GET SUED
FOR THAT, TOO.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.661
GAPS?

31:02.694 --> 31:05.397
CHIEF, NO GAPS.

31:05.431 --> 31:10.402
UH, CHIEF, I JUST GOT THIS BACK
FROM LATENT PRINTS.

31:10.436 --> 31:12.438
DREW GIBSON'S PAWS
ARE ALL OVER IT.
THANKS.

31:12.471 --> 31:13.572
ANYONE ELSE?

31:13.605 --> 31:15.541
NO.

31:15.574 --> 31:18.010
UH, LIEUTENANT...

31:18.044 --> 31:19.145
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO GO HOME?

31:19.178 --> 31:21.914
AND DO WHAT?
GET DRUNK?

31:23.682 --> 31:25.484
NOT TONIGHT.

31:25.517 --> 31:28.420
RIGHT.

31:29.688 --> 31:31.223
O-OKAY.

31:36.662 --> 31:40.366
MY WIFE CANNOT
FIND OUT ABOUT THIS.

31:40.399 --> 31:43.469
THIS CONVERSATION
IS 100% CONFIDENTIAL, SIR.

31:45.604 --> 31:47.940
IT'S SO EMBARRASSING.

31:47.974 --> 31:49.275
HIRING A PROSTITUTE.

31:49.308 --> 31:51.643
I'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING
LIKE THIS BEFORE.

31:52.979 --> 31:55.347
YOU WON'T BE PUTTING MY NAME
IN THE PAPERS, WILL YOU?

31:55.381 --> 31:57.216
OH, BELIEVE ME, WE DON'T WRITE
THE NEWS AROUND HERE.

31:57.249 --> 31:59.218
JUST A FEW
FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS

31:59.251 --> 32:00.652
ON WHAT YOU'VE ALREADY TOLD
THE FBI.

32:00.686 --> 32:03.655
WE KNOW YOU DIDN'T SHOW UP
FOR THAT PROSTITUTE.

32:03.689 --> 32:04.991
DID YOU?

32:05.024 --> 32:06.658
WHAT WAS HER NAME?

32:06.692 --> 32:08.027
SEDONA?

32:08.060 --> 32:09.461
WAS THAT WHAT
SHE CALLED HERSELF?

32:10.729 --> 32:12.198
I GUESS, YEAH.

32:12.231 --> 32:13.399
THESE NAMES...

32:14.600 --> 32:17.003
LOOK, THAT NIGHT,
I DON'T KNOW,

32:17.036 --> 32:19.638
I JUST...I COULDN'T
GO THROUGH WITH IT.

32:19.671 --> 32:21.473
WELL, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE BIT WEIRD.

32:21.507 --> 32:22.708
RIGHT?

32:22.741 --> 32:24.343
SEDONA BEING YOUR HALF-SISTER
AND ALL.

32:27.013 --> 32:29.748
OKAY, WAIT.

32:29.781 --> 32:32.418
I CAN EXPLAIN.
THIS IS NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

32:32.451 --> 32:33.585
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?

32:33.619 --> 32:35.254
I DON'T KNOW --

32:35.287 --> 32:37.456
LIKE I HAD SOME KIND OF SICK
SITUATION GOING ON WITH HER.

32:37.489 --> 32:38.724
I...

32:38.757 --> 32:40.759
I WAS TRYING TO HELP HER.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.294
SHE NEEDED HELP.

32:42.328 --> 32:45.164
HE'S GONNA EXPLAIN
HIS WAY OUT OF THIS,

32:45.197 --> 32:46.465
AND WE HAVE NOTHING
TO HOLD HIM ON.

32:46.498 --> 32:48.267
IS THAT WHAT THE MONEY
WAS FOR?

32:48.300 --> 32:50.469
THE $50,000 IN CASH

32:50.502 --> 32:52.271
YOU WITHDREW FROM
YOUR BANK ACCOUNT 10 DAYS AGO?

32:54.040 --> 32:56.508
WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH
FOUR ACES MODELS? I THOUGHT --

32:56.542 --> 32:58.277
WAS THE MONEY FOR HER,
MR. PITTMAN?

32:58.310 --> 33:01.680
LOOK --

33:01.713 --> 33:04.216
SHE HAD PROBLEMS.

33:04.250 --> 33:05.551
OBVIOUSLY.

33:05.584 --> 33:07.186
I KNOW IT SOUNDS
TERRIBLE,

33:07.219 --> 33:10.222
BUT I DIDN'T WANT "SEDONA"
TO EMBARRASS MY FAMILY,

33:10.256 --> 33:12.558
IN WHICH SHE MOST DECIDEDLY
DID NOT BELONG.

33:12.591 --> 33:15.127
SO, YES...

33:15.161 --> 33:16.495
THE MONEY WAS FOR HER.

33:22.368 --> 33:24.470
THAT'S...

33:24.503 --> 33:27.539
NOT WHAT SEDONA'S HUSBAND
IS TELLING US.

33:27.573 --> 33:29.241
WHAT?

33:29.275 --> 33:30.276
WHAT?

33:32.344 --> 33:33.445
THAT'S RIGHT.

33:33.479 --> 33:35.481
MR. GIBSON IS PAINTING

33:35.514 --> 33:37.516
A VERY DIFFERENT PICTURE
OF WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

33:37.549 --> 33:40.052
SO, UM, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US
FOR A MOMENT,

33:40.086 --> 33:42.554
I'M JUST GONNA RUN
WHAT YOU TOLD US BY MR. GIBSON,

33:42.588 --> 33:44.423
AND, UH, WE'LL SEE
HOW HE REACTS.

33:44.456 --> 33:45.657
EXCUSE ME.

33:45.691 --> 33:47.659
STAY HERE.

33:50.229 --> 33:51.563
OH, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE,
DETECTIVE.

33:51.597 --> 33:53.365
I'M SORRY, CHIEF.
I WAS TRYING TO --

33:53.399 --> 33:54.700
NO, NO, NO, NO.
IT'S FANTASTIC.

33:54.733 --> 33:56.202
I JUST NEED A --
A MOMENT

33:56.235 --> 33:57.703
TO THINK ABOUT
HOW THIS ALL PLAYS OUT.

33:59.638 --> 34:01.107
Pope: WHAT WAS THAT?

34:01.140 --> 34:02.441
DREW GIBSON IS DEAD.

34:02.474 --> 34:04.210
YEAH,
PITTMAN DOESN'T KNOW THAT.

34:04.243 --> 34:07.146
OKAY, BUT IF YOU SAY SOMETHING
PITTMAN KNOWS ISN'T TRUE --

34:07.179 --> 34:09.748
I'LL JUST SAY THAT'S WHAT
SEDONA'S DEAD HUSBAND TOLD ME.

34:13.719 --> 34:16.422
I AM SO SORRY,
UH, MR. PITTMAN,

34:16.455 --> 34:19.425
BUT MR. GIBSON INSISTS
THAT YOU GAVE HIM $50,000

34:19.458 --> 34:20.626
TO GET RID OF SEDONA.

34:20.659 --> 34:22.794
WHAT? THAT'S --
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

34:22.828 --> 34:24.296
I DON'T KNOW.

34:24.330 --> 34:25.364
HE SAID YOU PAID HIM
TO KILL HER.

34:25.397 --> 34:26.465
THE MAN IS A LUNATIC,

34:26.498 --> 34:28.567
AND, BY THE WAY,
A JUNKIE.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.436
HOW'D YOU KNOW
HE WAS A JUNKIE?

34:32.838 --> 34:34.740
PERHAPS I SHOULD ASK
FOR A LAWYER.

34:34.773 --> 34:37.476
IF YOU WANT TO WAIT
FOR AN ATTORNEY, THAT'S FINE.

34:37.509 --> 34:40.146
I'D BE HAPPY TO TALK
TO MR. GIBSON.

34:40.179 --> 34:42.348
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT THE FIRST PERSON

34:42.381 --> 34:44.150
I SEND TO THE D.A.
GETS A DEAL,

34:44.183 --> 34:45.517
AND THE SECOND
GETS THE DEATH PENALTY.

34:45.551 --> 34:48.420
THE DEATH PENALTY?

34:48.454 --> 34:49.688
WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

34:49.721 --> 34:51.890
THIS CAN BE EXPLAINED.
THEN HURRY IT UP!

34:51.923 --> 34:55.227
I GAVE DREW MONEY.

34:55.261 --> 34:57.429
BUT I JUST ASKED HIM
TO GET THE GIRL

34:57.463 --> 34:58.564
TO GO BACK TO ARIZONA

34:58.597 --> 34:59.865
OR WHEREVER IT WAS
SHE WAS FROM.

34:59.898 --> 35:01.400
THAT'S IT.

35:01.433 --> 35:03.735
Sanchez: WHAT WAS
THE HOTEL ROOM FOR?

35:03.769 --> 35:05.604
SHE HAD STOPPED RETURNING
HIS CALLS,

35:05.637 --> 35:07.239
SO I ARRANGED
THE APPOINTMENT

35:07.273 --> 35:09.175
SO THAT DREW COULD SPEAK
TO HIS WIFE.

35:11.343 --> 35:14.213
D-DO YOU HAVE A PRESCRIPTION
FOR AMBIEN?

35:14.246 --> 35:15.747
ALONG WITH 50 MILLION
OTHER PEOPLE -- YES.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.249
NOT DREW GIBSON.

35:17.283 --> 35:19.551
AND YET WE FOUND SOME
IN HIS HOUSE...

35:19.585 --> 35:21.353
IN THIS ENVELOPE.

35:21.387 --> 35:25.691
HE SAYS THAT YOU GAVE HIM THIS
TO KNOCK SEDONA OUT FIRST.

35:25.724 --> 35:26.925
HE COULD HAVE GOTTEN AMBIEN
FROM ANYWHERE.

35:26.958 --> 35:28.627
THAT'S TRUE.

35:28.660 --> 35:31.263
BUT THERE'S TWO SETS OF
FINGERPRINTS ON THAT ENVELOPE.

35:31.297 --> 35:34.166
ONE SET.
ONE SET ONLY.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.534
SOME OF THEM BELONG
TO MR. GIBSON,

35:35.567 --> 35:36.868
AND THE OTHERS
DON'T SHOW UP IN OUR SYSTEM.

35:36.902 --> 35:39.238
SO, WITH THAT IN MIND...

35:39.271 --> 35:41.373
WOULD YOU PLEASE
COME WITH ME, SIR?

35:41.407 --> 35:42.741
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

35:42.774 --> 35:44.343
TO ROLL YOUR PRINTS.

35:44.376 --> 35:45.477
SEE IF THEY MATCH
THE UNIDENTIFIED ONES

35:45.511 --> 35:46.512
ON THIS ENVELOPE.

35:50.816 --> 35:53.852
WHAT IF -- WHAT IF I DON'T WANT
MY FINGERPRINTS TAKEN?

35:53.885 --> 35:56.222
I HAVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE,
DON'T I?

35:56.255 --> 35:57.756
UP TO THE TIME I ARREST YOU
FOR MURDER.

35:57.789 --> 35:58.890
YOU WANT ME
TO DO THAT NOW?

35:58.924 --> 35:59.925
YOU PEOPLE.

35:59.958 --> 36:02.394
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
FINE.

36:02.428 --> 36:03.562
I GAVE DREW THE AMBIEN.

36:03.595 --> 36:04.796
BUT I DIDN'T GIVE HIM
THE HEROIN,

36:04.830 --> 36:06.498
AND I DIDN'T TELL HIM
TO KILL ANYBODY.

36:06.532 --> 36:08.500
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT SEDONA DIED
OF A HEROIN OVERDOSE?

36:08.534 --> 36:10.469
WE DIDN'T TELL HIM THAT.
DID WE, DETECTIVE?

36:10.502 --> 36:12.338
TOO MANY LIES,
MR. PITTMAN.

36:12.371 --> 36:14.740
AT LEAST MR. GIBSON
TOLD US THE TRUTH

36:14.773 --> 36:16.908
AND EXPRESSED SOME REGRET.

36:16.942 --> 36:18.877
I THINK THE TWO OF YOU
NEED TO SIT DOWN

36:18.910 --> 36:20.446
AND TALK FOR A MOMENT.

36:20.479 --> 36:21.947
I JUST NEED HIM
TO PHYSICALLY IDENTIFY YOU

36:21.980 --> 36:24.316
AND CONFIRM THAT YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO PAID HIM.

36:24.350 --> 36:26.852
WAIT! WAIT! LOOK --
LOOK, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

36:26.885 --> 36:29.388
THIS...HOOKER SHOWED UP
OUT OF THE BLUE

36:29.421 --> 36:31.323
AND TOLD ME
SHE WAS MY SISTER.

36:31.357 --> 36:34.360
NOW, IT'S NO SURPRISE
THAT MY FATHER SCREWED
AROUND WITH THE MAIDS,

36:34.393 --> 36:36.695
BUT WHY SHOULD MY BROTHER AND I
HAVE TO PAY FOR IT?

36:36.728 --> 36:39.298
THIS LITTLE BITCH DIDN'T
DESERVE ONE PENNY OF
MY FATHER'S ESTATE.

36:39.331 --> 36:41.567
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT SHE WANTED -- HER SHARE.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.802
I REFUSE TO LET TRASH
LIKE THAT

36:43.835 --> 36:45.337
DRAG MY FAMILY
THROUGH THE GUTTER

36:45.371 --> 36:46.004
AND THEN PAY HER
FOR THE INSULT.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.573
I HAD AN OBLIGATION

36:47.606 --> 36:51.343
TO PROTECT US FROM BEING
ROBBED AND DISGRACED --

36:51.377 --> 36:53.645
SOMETHING I'M CERTAIN A JUDGE
WILL UNDERSTAND.

36:53.679 --> 36:54.980
WHAT A JUDGE
WILL UNDERSTAND

36:55.013 --> 36:57.549
DEPENDS ON WHO I SEND
TO THE D.A. FIRST.

36:57.583 --> 36:58.750
FINE.

36:58.784 --> 37:00.986
I WENT TO SEDONA'S
LOSER HUSBAND,

37:01.019 --> 37:02.988
AND I ASKED HIM
TO GET RID OF HER.

37:03.021 --> 37:05.891
AND I PAID HIM $50,000
TO MAKE SURE SHE NEVER CAME

37:05.924 --> 37:07.659
NEAR MY HOUSE AGAIN.

37:07.693 --> 37:09.495
IS THAT GOOD ENOUGH...

37:09.528 --> 37:11.363
TO GET ME OUT OF HERE
AND INTO THE D.A.'s OFFICE?

37:11.397 --> 37:12.964
NO, YOU WANT MORE?

37:12.998 --> 37:14.766
YOU WANT MORE.
FINE!

37:14.800 --> 37:16.535
I PAID DREW

37:16.568 --> 37:18.870
TO KILL THE WOMAN THAT WAS
THREATENING MY FAMILY.

37:18.904 --> 37:19.805
IS THA GOOD ENOUGH?

37:19.838 --> 37:21.373
MAY I GO NOW...

37:21.407 --> 37:23.742
WHILE YOU DEAL WITH THE
DREW GIBSONS OF THE WORLD?

37:25.377 --> 37:27.713
ACTUALLY, SIR, WE ALREADY DEALT
WITH MR. GIBSON.

37:27.746 --> 37:30.015
Sanchez: DREW GIBSON
WAS SHOT DEAD EARLIER TODAY.

37:30.048 --> 37:32.918
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST FOR
THE MURDER OF SEDONA GIBSON.

37:32.951 --> 37:34.386
WHAT?!

37:34.420 --> 37:35.987
YOU'VE BEEN LYING TO ME
THIS WHOLE TIME?

37:36.021 --> 37:37.389
GET RID OF HIM,
DETECTIVE.

37:37.423 --> 37:38.490
LET'S GO.

37:38.524 --> 37:39.358
YOU'RE IN
WAY OVER YOUR HEADS.

37:39.391 --> 37:40.826
YOU HAVE NO IDEA!

37:40.859 --> 37:44.062
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA GET AWAY
WITH THIS -- EVER!

37:44.095 --> 37:45.063
I HAVE A QUESTION
FOR YOU, SIR.

37:45.096 --> 37:47.633
WHO THE HELL IS THIS?

37:47.666 --> 37:48.600
YOU SHUT UP.

37:50.336 --> 37:53.772
DID SEDONA EVER ONCE
ACTUALLY ASK YOU FOR ANY MONEY?

37:53.805 --> 37:55.006
NO.

37:55.040 --> 37:56.675
BUT SHE WAS A WHORE.

37:56.708 --> 37:58.744
WHAT ELSE COULD SHE POSSIBLY
HAVE WANTED?

38:16.094 --> 38:18.430
CHIEF JOHNSON,
I WANT TO THANK YOU

38:18.464 --> 38:19.865
FOR SEEING THIS THROUGH.

38:19.898 --> 38:21.500
ABSOLUTELY.

38:21.533 --> 38:23.902
I JUST WISH IT HAD BEEN
A HAPPIER ENDING.

38:25.904 --> 38:28.607
I FEEL LIKE...

38:28.640 --> 38:30.576
I KNOW MY DAUGHTER AGAIN.

38:34.813 --> 38:37.616
I THOUGHT ABOUT COMING OUT HERE
SO MANY TIMES,

38:37.649 --> 38:40.519
JUST TO FIND HER.

38:40.552 --> 38:42.854
BUT I NEVER DID.

38:46.925 --> 38:48.627
I LET HER DOWN.

38:51.830 --> 38:54.332
I LET HER DOWN.

38:55.867 --> 38:57.836
BUT YOU CAME THROUGH
FOR HER AT THE END.

38:57.869 --> 38:59.505
WE NEVER WOULD
HAVE BEEN --

38:59.538 --> 39:01.072
BUT IT'S ONLY THE END

39:01.106 --> 39:02.441
BECAUSE I WASN'T HERE.

39:02.474 --> 39:04.876
BECAUSE I GAVE UP ON HER.

39:04.910 --> 39:09.014
BECAUSE MY POOR BABY...

39:09.047 --> 39:12.017
I LET HER DOWN.

39:12.050 --> 39:14.653
I LET HER DOWN.

39:14.686 --> 39:17.055
I LET HER DOWN.
I LET HER DOWN.

39:35.574 --> 39:39.645
CAPTAIN,
THIS REALLY ISN'T A GOOD TIME.

39:54.460 --> 39:55.827
OKAY.

39:55.861 --> 39:58.564
AFTER YOU DROPPED
TURELL BAYLOR OFF AT HIS HOUSE

39:58.597 --> 39:59.865
AND BEFORE YOU DROVE AWAY,

39:59.898 --> 40:02.067
DETECTIVE GABRIEL
SAID SOMETHING TO YOU,

40:02.100 --> 40:03.435
AND IT WAS IMPORTANT,

40:03.469 --> 40:05.136
BECAUSE DETECTIVE SANCHEZ
REFUSES

40:05.170 --> 40:06.838
TO REPEAT IT.

40:06.872 --> 40:09.575
THE BAYLOR FAMILY'S ATTORNEY
KNOWS ABOUT THIS CONVERSATION,

40:09.608 --> 40:10.942
AND I STILL DON'T.

40:20.552 --> 40:22.120
AFTER WE LET TURELL GO...

40:24.690 --> 40:28.059
...AND BEFORE
WE DROVE AWAY...

40:28.093 --> 40:29.528
DETECTIVE GABRIEL ASKED ME

40:29.561 --> 40:31.563
IF I THOUGHT WE SHOULD
STICK AROUND.

40:34.165 --> 40:35.634
I SEE.

40:37.268 --> 40:38.937
YOU TOLD HIM TO GO.

40:42.641 --> 40:43.775
I DID.

40:51.850 --> 40:54.052
WELL, THAT'S THE LAWSUIT,
ISN'T IT?

40:55.921 --> 40:59.090
DETECTIVE GABRIEL ASKED YOU
THE $20 MILLION QUESTION,

40:59.124 --> 41:00.759
BUT THE THING IS,

41:00.792 --> 41:03.529
HOW DOES THE PLAINTIFF'S
ATTORNEY KNOW

41:03.562 --> 41:04.896
HOW YOU ANSWERED IT?

41:07.833 --> 41:09.100
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

41:11.703 --> 41:13.939
SOMEWHERE IN YOUR DIVISION,
CHIEF JOHNSON...

41:15.140 --> 41:17.008
...YOU HAVE A LEAK.
