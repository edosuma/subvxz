WEBVTT

00:58.846 --> 01:00.348
Oh, Jeff!
Hey.

01:00.380 --> 01:01.615
Uh, yeah.

01:01.648 --> 01:04.218
I think you're mistaking me
for someone else.

01:08.657 --> 01:10.792
Oh, there you go.

01:10.824 --> 01:12.860
Ah.

01:12.893 --> 01:14.762
No.

01:14.796 --> 01:16.832
Like, it's Iris,
from Clarissa's party.

01:16.865 --> 01:19.302
Yeah. No, I... Yeah, sorry.
I don't think you're...-

01:19.334 --> 01:20.503
Oh, my God.

01:20.536 --> 01:21.704
I'm sorry.

01:21.736 --> 01:22.538
Yeah.
No, it's okay.

01:22.571 --> 01:23.940
I thought you were Jeff.
Oh, my God.

01:23.973 --> 01:25.675
Awkward.

01:28.944 --> 01:30.314
And you're walking
this way, too.

01:30.346 --> 01:31.514
Yeah, I know.

01:32.783 --> 01:33.951
- Great.
- I'm Simon.

01:33.983 --> 01:35.718
- Iris.
- Yeah. Got that.

01:35.751 --> 01:38.888
Uh, tell me something
about yourself, Iris.

01:38.921 --> 01:41.891
Mmm, okay. Well,

01:41.925 --> 01:43.894
my sister Agnes
is engaged to

01:43.928 --> 01:47.932
this porn-loving guy
named Justin.

01:47.964 --> 01:51.702
She can't see he's such
a sleaze ball, but I can.

01:53.371 --> 01:55.340
But no one ever
listens to me.

01:55.373 --> 01:56.574
I mean, my opinion

01:56.607 --> 01:58.710
doesn't really count much
in my family,

01:58.744 --> 02:01.813
especially when
it comes to my sister.

02:01.846 --> 02:04.649
She's just smarter
and, like, you know,

02:04.682 --> 02:05.583
more serious than me.

02:05.617 --> 02:09.656
And it just makes me feel,
like, stupid,

02:09.688 --> 02:12.858
or almost invisible.

02:12.891 --> 02:14.927
Yikes.

02:14.961 --> 02:16.330
That's too much.

02:16.362 --> 02:17.597
No. It...

02:17.629 --> 02:19.333
- Huh.
- Hmm.

02:19.367 --> 02:23.037
I have these, uh,

02:23.069 --> 02:25.639
super strict
Mennonite parents.

02:25.672 --> 02:27.474
They don't live
in the city,

02:27.508 --> 02:29.476
but they're, like,
always dropping in

02:29.510 --> 02:31.347
to, like, check in
and see what I'm doing.

02:31.380 --> 02:33.882
Yeah?

02:33.915 --> 02:35.917
Mostly it's just
super embarrassing.

02:35.951 --> 02:38.420
But, like,
it's so clear to me

02:38.452 --> 02:39.620
that they also think

02:39.654 --> 02:42.525
I'm this 10-year-old kid
still.

02:42.558 --> 02:43.994
I don't know.

02:49.030 --> 02:51.367
Hold on.

02:51.400 --> 02:53.001
You want to go grab
a drink?

02:53.035 --> 02:54.572
Right now?

02:54.604 --> 02:56.941
Yeah.

02:56.973 --> 02:59.076
Uh, yeah.

02:59.108 --> 03:02.779
So, seeing that

03:02.812 --> 03:04.948
I've already overshared
and stuff,

03:04.982 --> 03:07.485
I have a proposal.

03:07.519 --> 03:09.020
May I?

03:09.053 --> 03:10.621
- Please. Yep.
- Okay.

03:12.823 --> 03:17.395
I propose we never
see each other again

03:17.429 --> 03:19.098
after tonight,

03:19.130 --> 03:23.568
so we can say
anything we want.

03:23.602 --> 03:24.736
I don't need to know
your last name.

03:24.770 --> 03:25.772
You don't need to
know mine.

03:25.805 --> 03:27.740
Just reveal
whatever secrets

03:27.772 --> 03:31.979
we want to,
just for tonight,

03:32.011 --> 03:35.982
and then
we'll leave it at that.

03:36.016 --> 03:38.952
Uh...

03:38.985 --> 03:40.053
...okay.

03:40.086 --> 03:41.856
Yeah?

03:41.888 --> 03:45.093
Yeah. I'm very nervous
right now. Should I be?

03:45.125 --> 03:48.195
You got a lot of secrets?

03:50.030 --> 03:53.868
Ooh, you do.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.571
- We'll find out. We're going to find out.
- Okay.

03:55.603 --> 03:58.072
And we're cheers-ing
on it.

03:58.106 --> 03:59.141
Here goes.

03:59.173 --> 04:00.176
That's legally binding.

04:00.208 --> 04:01.976
Okay.

04:02.010 --> 04:04.179
You first.

04:04.213 --> 04:06.049
I just tell you a secret?

04:06.082 --> 04:09.453
Yeah. Anything. Random.

04:09.485 --> 04:10.554
Uh, I have a fear.

04:10.586 --> 04:12.721
You have a fear?

04:12.755 --> 04:15.459
I have a fear.

04:15.491 --> 04:19.931
I'm, um, scared of horses.

04:22.166 --> 04:23.501
Why?

04:23.534 --> 04:27.004
Uh, I don't...
They're for... Okay.

04:27.037 --> 04:29.640
Um, they're...
I don't know.

04:29.672 --> 04:31.576
- I honestly do not know.
- Is it just the way they look?

04:31.610 --> 04:34.612
- Is it the sound?
- Yes. Their weird looks.

04:34.646 --> 04:36.782
It feels like maybe
they know how you feel.

04:36.814 --> 04:37.882
Maybe. I don't know.

04:37.915 --> 04:39.084
Wow.

04:39.117 --> 04:40.486
I don't trust them
at all.

04:40.519 --> 04:41.620
I mean, sure.

04:41.653 --> 04:42.822
Fully afraid.

04:42.854 --> 04:44.657
And I wish I had, like,
a cool story

04:44.690 --> 04:46.793
where I was, like, caught in
a horse stampede, but no.

04:46.825 --> 04:48.027
Yeah. You know, like...
Or something like

04:48.060 --> 04:49.262
you were on a horse
and then you fell off.

04:49.294 --> 04:52.498
Not even that.
Never even got on a horse.

04:52.532 --> 04:54.634
Good start.

04:55.903 --> 05:00.140
Uh, I keep
a bullshit journal.

05:00.172 --> 05:04.511
I do this thing where
I have a blank agenda,

05:04.545 --> 05:07.649
plan some dates
and events

05:07.681 --> 05:11.752
and trips,
write it in pen,

05:11.786 --> 05:13.555
but I don't actually
do them.

05:14.788 --> 05:16.724
It's just for show.

05:16.757 --> 05:18.093
I kind of like it.

05:18.126 --> 05:19.561
There's something...
There's something to that.

05:20.796 --> 05:21.964
- Interesting.
- Yeah, right.

05:21.996 --> 05:23.633
- Yeah, yeah.
- You'd be, like...

05:23.665 --> 05:25.535
No, no. You got...
There's something.

05:25.568 --> 05:27.937
It's, uh, layers.
I'm, like, scared of horses.

05:27.970 --> 05:29.773
You got a whole...
You got a whole thing.

05:29.805 --> 05:31.774
Weird.

05:31.807 --> 05:35.312
I've only been here for three...
Three years.

05:35.344 --> 05:37.980
- I came from Morden.
- Oh!

05:38.014 --> 05:40.716
- You know it?
- I've never been.

05:40.750 --> 05:42.921
- Oh, my God. You're missing out.
- Am I?

05:42.953 --> 05:44.154
City of dreams, yeah.

05:44.188 --> 05:45.757
- Wow.
- Yeah.

05:45.789 --> 05:46.890
- Anyways, so I came here.
- Yeah... yeah, came here.

05:46.924 --> 05:48.793
And I didn't know anyone.

05:48.825 --> 05:52.029
The first time I went to
a bar in this city,

05:52.063 --> 05:54.033
I got in a fight.

05:54.066 --> 05:55.568
Wow. You don't...

05:55.600 --> 05:57.069
Not, like, a fight.

05:57.102 --> 05:59.805
Like, I just got, like,
the shit kicked out of me.

05:59.838 --> 06:01.240
Oh, yeah. You don't
strike me as a punchy...

06:01.273 --> 06:03.342
Probably, like, the accurate...
Scrapper, yeah. No.

06:03.374 --> 06:04.642
Yeah, okay.

06:04.675 --> 06:06.779
And I couldn't stop thinking
about it,

06:06.813 --> 06:08.147
and I kept playing it
over and over in my head.

06:08.181 --> 06:11.151
And then I found the guy,
online.

06:11.183 --> 06:14.286
And, uh,
ever since that happened,

06:14.320 --> 06:15.755
I follow him on Facebook.

06:15.788 --> 06:18.893
And I just constantly
check his page,

06:18.926 --> 06:20.595
because I'm hoping one time
I log in

06:20.628 --> 06:23.931
and something, like, really
horrible has happened to him,

06:23.963 --> 06:26.900
like house burned down,
fell down a flight of stairs.

06:26.934 --> 06:31.238
Anything.
Like, I check it a lot.

06:31.271 --> 06:32.740
That's fucked up.

06:34.009 --> 06:37.846
I know. I know.

06:37.879 --> 06:41.784
I was born with...

06:41.816 --> 06:43.285
...a congenital
heart disease.

06:43.318 --> 06:48.123
Like, my heart has
this tiny little hole.

06:50.693 --> 06:52.695
And if they weren't going to
fix it, I was going to die.

06:52.727 --> 06:54.931
My parents
always tell me this,

06:54.964 --> 06:58.401
how they looked at

06:58.435 --> 07:00.069
the entire operation
through a window,

07:00.103 --> 07:04.641
so they've literally

07:04.675 --> 07:06.077
seen my heart.

07:08.046 --> 07:09.981
So, I can't really hide anything
from them.

07:10.013 --> 07:12.916
I, uh...

07:12.950 --> 07:16.955
I never...

07:16.988 --> 07:19.792
...do this.
You know what I mean?

07:19.824 --> 07:22.661
- I can't, uh... I feel like...
- Talk to people?

07:22.694 --> 07:24.396
Well, no. I can talk to people.

07:24.429 --> 07:26.165
I just sort of feel like

07:26.198 --> 07:30.971
I usually...
I never let anyone close.

07:31.003 --> 07:32.405
When things get intense,
I walk.

07:32.438 --> 07:35.241
I literally
walk out the door.

07:35.274 --> 07:37.877
So, it's easier
just to wear this mask,

07:37.911 --> 07:40.447
and I can't let
anybody past that,

07:40.479 --> 07:45.152
'cause then it's just me
after that, and I don't know.

07:45.186 --> 07:48.923
I don't want to give that
to anyone.

07:48.955 --> 07:51.725
Hmm.

07:51.758 --> 07:54.829
I always wished that
I was that girl,

07:54.863 --> 07:58.399
the one that makes
the wild choices.

07:58.432 --> 08:02.303
Like, I've only ever had
one guy

08:02.336 --> 08:03.438
that I slept with,

08:03.471 --> 08:07.376
and that was
a while ago.

08:07.409 --> 08:10.479
I don't feel like

08:10.513 --> 08:13.483
anyone
could want me.

08:13.515 --> 08:18.421
Like, I'm just
this unlovable girl.

08:18.454 --> 08:22.726
You seem like the opposite
of unlovable.

08:28.232 --> 08:30.235
Well...

08:33.203 --> 08:35.873
...it's getting late.
I got to go.

08:35.907 --> 08:39.478
Oh, seriously?

08:39.510 --> 08:41.981
Thanks for the...

08:42.014 --> 08:43.448
Yeah. Yeah, totally.

08:43.482 --> 08:46.752
Okay. Yeah.

08:51.055 --> 08:53.059
Bye-bye.

09:01.568 --> 09:04.305
You ever been in
a three-way?

09:06.574 --> 09:08.109
No.

09:08.142 --> 09:09.944
You want to?

09:09.976 --> 09:11.512
Uh, with you?

09:11.546 --> 09:13.215
Well, yeah, probably.

09:16.316 --> 09:18.220
So, this dude,
he's talking to me, right?

09:18.253 --> 09:20.222
He's asking me all these
questions, and then he's, like,

09:20.254 --> 09:21.923
"How would you like to make
a thousand dollars

09:21.956 --> 09:24.393
"to be in a porno?
And if you bring your friend,

09:24.426 --> 09:27.797
he can make
a thousand dollars, too."

09:27.830 --> 09:30.866
You want to do
a porno?

09:30.899 --> 09:32.334
You want me to be in a porno,
with you?

09:32.367 --> 09:34.871
Why not? Yeah.

09:34.904 --> 09:35.938
What?
It's not weird.

09:35.972 --> 09:37.374
- It is weird.
- It's not weird.

09:37.406 --> 09:38.374
Yeah. It's ridiculously weird.

09:38.408 --> 09:40.811
I cannot believe
we're having this conversation.

09:40.843 --> 09:42.078
Look.

09:42.112 --> 09:43.280
You don't
have to look at it.

09:43.314 --> 09:44.915
You don't have to look at it.

09:44.949 --> 09:46.117
I won't look at yours.

09:46.150 --> 09:47.351
You won't have to
look at mine.

09:47.385 --> 09:49.319
- We don't got to make eye contact.
- You will look at mine.

09:49.352 --> 09:50.554
I might just. Why?

09:50.588 --> 09:53.256
- No.
- Why not?

09:53.290 --> 09:55.927
It's insane to me that I would
have to explain that to you.

09:55.960 --> 09:58.529
Well...

09:58.563 --> 10:00.332
Well, it's not like
you ain't having sex.

10:00.364 --> 10:01.399
Now you're just
getting paid for it.

10:01.432 --> 10:03.401
Ugh.

10:03.435 --> 10:06.038
What? What's up?

10:06.071 --> 10:07.606
Nothing.

10:07.639 --> 10:10.909
What? Come on.
Fuck that. What's up?

10:10.942 --> 10:13.278
You and I,
we know each other.

10:13.311 --> 10:15.181
We can be ourselves.

10:15.214 --> 10:17.350
You can ask me to be
in a porno for some reason.

10:17.383 --> 10:19.086
But you know,
you meet someone new

10:19.119 --> 10:21.989
and, uh, you can't.

10:22.022 --> 10:25.158
You have to say certain things
and be a certain way,

10:25.192 --> 10:29.062
and if you take it
too far too soon, then...

10:29.096 --> 10:30.631
You know, but
it's all in the service

10:30.664 --> 10:31.866
of getting to know them,

10:31.900 --> 10:32.967
so I don't see
why you can't...

10:33.001 --> 10:35.203
No, no. We going to talk
about, what, Margaret again?

10:35.236 --> 10:36.571
We're going to
talk about...

10:36.603 --> 10:38.472
Margaret? What?
Iris. Iris.

10:38.505 --> 10:39.908
Iris. Yo, yo.

10:39.941 --> 10:42.979
Okay. We're going to
talk about Iris again.

10:43.011 --> 10:44.646
No, I'm not.
What do you mean, "again"?

10:44.679 --> 10:45.982
No, no, no.
Keep going.

10:46.015 --> 10:47.050
This is
very interesting.

10:47.083 --> 10:49.017
- Oh, I'm sorry. Am I interrupting you?
- No, no, no.

10:49.050 --> 10:50.185
Are you working
right now or what?

10:50.218 --> 10:51.319
I come to you,
telling you

10:51.353 --> 10:52.420
about my fucking great
porno idea,

10:52.454 --> 10:54.424
and you're over here talking
about some random woman

10:54.456 --> 10:55.591
you ain't going to
never talk to again.

10:55.624 --> 10:57.059
No. It's not...

10:57.093 --> 10:58.962
It felt like there was
something there,

10:58.994 --> 11:02.331
which I don't feel like happens
every time I meet someone.

11:02.364 --> 11:03.933
- You know what I mean?
- Sure.

11:03.966 --> 11:08.305
And I didn't get her last name
and, uh, now she's gone.

11:09.572 --> 11:14.345
So, that's pretty classic me.

11:14.378 --> 11:16.381
You could try to, uh,
stop bitching for a bit.

11:16.413 --> 11:17.649
Have you
thought about that?

11:17.682 --> 11:20.318
Did you try,
uh, not complaining?

11:20.351 --> 11:21.519
How did that go
for you?

11:21.553 --> 11:23.688
You good? Like, because
I wouldn't want you

11:23.721 --> 11:25.090
to accidentally start working...

11:25.123 --> 11:28.527
...someone helping out
with this shit.

11:28.559 --> 11:31.163
It doesn't matter, ultimately.
That's what I'm saying.

11:31.197 --> 11:32.465
Because even if
I found her, you know,

11:32.497 --> 11:36.001
we did this weird
oversharing thing...

11:36.034 --> 11:38.270
You got to stop this.

11:38.304 --> 11:41.375
You got to beating up on
yourself like this, okay?

11:41.407 --> 11:43.944
'Cause you are handsome
and funny.

11:43.978 --> 11:47.614
- You got really pretty eyes.
- All right.

11:47.647 --> 11:48.983
You are good at

11:49.016 --> 11:51.385
whatever the fuck
you're doing over there.

11:51.417 --> 11:52.485
Come do a porno with me,
all right?

11:52.518 --> 11:53.620
We would be
so good at it!

11:53.655 --> 11:55.589
I am not. I can't believe
that's where that was going.

11:55.623 --> 11:57.693
- We would be so good!
- It's not going to happen.

11:57.725 --> 11:58.893
Oh, no, no, no.

11:58.926 --> 12:03.598
I'm not... Why am I hearing
the sound of yimmer-yammering

12:03.631 --> 12:05.735
when I'm supposed to be hearing
the sound of hammering?

12:05.768 --> 12:08.537
I don't understand.
I just don't get it.

12:08.571 --> 12:10.172
Gentlemen,

12:10.206 --> 12:14.610
you got to let me help you
so you can help me.

12:14.643 --> 12:16.379
All right? What have I told you
guys about talking on the job?

12:16.412 --> 12:17.715
Not to, all right?

12:17.747 --> 12:20.483
Three reasons: number one,
I'm losing money.

12:20.516 --> 12:22.585
Number two,
you're losing money.

12:22.619 --> 12:24.120
And number three,
the powers that be...

12:25.688 --> 12:26.656
They're sucking the information

12:26.689 --> 12:28.291
right out of your brain
when you're not focused.

12:28.325 --> 12:29.561
You think I'm joking?
Check your phone.

12:29.593 --> 12:32.097
Every time you go on that phone,
they're vacuuming your brain.

12:32.130 --> 12:34.064
So, I need you to be focused.
Okay, guys?

12:34.097 --> 12:35.567
- Yep.
- You got that?

12:35.599 --> 12:38.168
- Yep.
- Hey, Simon?

12:38.202 --> 12:40.371
You missed a spot.
You? Keep stirring paint.

12:40.405 --> 12:43.108
Yeah, yeah.

12:43.141 --> 12:45.044
- What are you looking at?
- Well, it's break time, man.

12:45.077 --> 12:46.112
Yeah.

12:46.145 --> 12:48.247
- It's time to...
- No, no. You fail to understand.

12:48.280 --> 12:49.749
I came over here
to break your balls

12:49.781 --> 12:51.083
because
you weren't working.

12:51.116 --> 12:53.119
So, break time?
I don't think so.

12:53.151 --> 12:57.157
♪ Sparks began ♪

13:06.767 --> 13:08.802
The last thing is
giveaways and door prizes.

13:08.836 --> 13:11.239
And that will be
all in the wedding party

13:11.272 --> 13:14.075
and the... I don't know.
The niñas and niños.

13:16.177 --> 13:17.279
Iris, Iris?

13:17.312 --> 13:18.380
Iris?

13:18.413 --> 13:19.380
Hello?

13:19.414 --> 13:22.083
Come here, Iris.

13:22.116 --> 13:23.618
Can you figure out

13:23.651 --> 13:26.454
if your work can do
a social donation?

13:29.525 --> 13:34.297
...budget plans.
So, come over.

13:36.432 --> 13:38.768
No, she's too...
Dad, she's too busy.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.737
She's thinking about Stanley.

13:40.770 --> 13:42.772
Stanley?

13:42.805 --> 13:43.840
I mean, Steven. I mean...

13:43.873 --> 13:45.108
What?

13:45.142 --> 13:46.310
It's Simon!

13:46.343 --> 13:48.279
Right. I was right.
Simon. It's Simon, Mom.

13:48.311 --> 13:50.146
It's Simon and I'm never going
to see him again, okay?

13:50.180 --> 13:51.582
Simon and she's probably
going to see him again.

13:55.452 --> 13:57.521
No, no, no, Ma.

13:57.555 --> 14:00.825
We just had a drink that one
time and that's it, okay?

14:06.432 --> 14:10.302
Fine. Okay, okay, okay.
What do you want me to do?

14:10.336 --> 14:11.504
You can handle
the budget.

14:12.770 --> 14:14.106
Tell me.

14:15.374 --> 14:16.509
Nurse?

14:18.477 --> 14:20.213
...music... boyfriend...

14:21.715 --> 14:22.850
No, I don't think so.

14:22.882 --> 14:24.250
Okay.

14:24.284 --> 14:25.486
Just give me the list
and I'll do it.

14:25.519 --> 14:26.820
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

14:26.852 --> 14:29.389
No, no. I'll do it.
I have my own stuff at work.

14:29.423 --> 14:31.860
Okay, Ma? I'll do it.
I won't mess it up.

14:31.892 --> 14:33.827
Do you promise?

14:33.861 --> 14:35.396
Yep. I promise.

14:35.429 --> 14:38.833
You're going to do it...

14:38.866 --> 14:40.268
Give her a chance.

14:41.435 --> 14:43.671
Yes, ma.
Simon says give her a chance.

14:43.704 --> 14:46.275
Simon?

14:48.877 --> 14:50.246
No.

14:50.278 --> 14:51.613
Is that what you want?

14:51.647 --> 14:53.550
No. We are not letting Simon
touch this.

14:53.582 --> 14:54.617
You are going to do the budget.

14:54.651 --> 14:55.852
I will not
see him again, okay?

14:55.884 --> 14:57.253
So, I will fix this.

14:58.521 --> 15:00.556
I don't want you to make
the same mistake.

15:00.590 --> 15:02.191
- I'm telling you.
- I won't.

15:03.725 --> 15:06.297
Oh. It's Justin.

15:06.330 --> 15:08.232
- Can you get it, please?
- Thank you.

15:08.264 --> 15:12.169
Oh. Justin.

15:12.202 --> 15:13.370
Hey.

15:13.403 --> 15:14.538
- Hey.
- Hi, hon.

15:14.572 --> 15:15.740
Hey, hey.
Sorry I'm late.

15:15.773 --> 15:17.176
Hope you guys didn't get
too far without me.

15:17.208 --> 15:18.176
No. Did the car start?

15:18.209 --> 15:19.343
It did, eventually.

15:19.376 --> 15:20.378
Good.

15:20.411 --> 15:21.245
Good. You're here.

15:21.279 --> 15:22.680
Yeah, thanks.
It's good to see you.

15:22.713 --> 15:23.781
Hi.

15:23.814 --> 15:25.784
How far did you get?
Did you get to the budget yet?

15:25.817 --> 15:28.654
Um, Iris is going to do
the budget.

15:28.687 --> 15:29.756
Cool. Well, maybe
we could do it together,

15:29.789 --> 15:30.657
'cause I was
kind of hoping

15:30.689 --> 15:31.958
I could actually have
a hand in that.

15:31.991 --> 15:34.894
- Oh, that's good. Yeah. Great idea.
- Yes, yes. Do it together.

15:34.926 --> 15:38.197
Okay. Maybe you could
just, like, meet and stuff?

15:38.231 --> 15:40.300
- Hi. How are you?
- It'll be easier that way.

15:40.333 --> 15:41.635
- Good to see you again.
- You, too.

15:41.667 --> 15:42.835
- Okay.
- Hi.

15:45.372 --> 15:47.341
- Oh, okay.
- Go ahead.

15:47.373 --> 15:49.209
- Yeah, I do.
- Where are you going?

15:49.243 --> 15:50.743
I'm going to go get some food.
Is that okay?

15:50.777 --> 15:52.312
Oh. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, it's fine.

15:52.345 --> 15:53.981
- You'll be okay here?
- I'm fine.

15:54.014 --> 15:56.317
- Okay. Iris, can you drive?
- Take care.

16:03.758 --> 16:05.428
I'm going to get you
to grab me

16:05.461 --> 16:07.495
some barbecued chicken,
spicy.

16:07.529 --> 16:09.298
And, uh, I don't need
nothing to drink.

16:09.331 --> 16:10.966
Just come in
and get it yourself.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.467
No, no, no.
I'm got to go park the car.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.970
We have, like,
12 minutes.

16:14.003 --> 16:16.606
Exactly. So, if you could get
the food, that'd be awesome.

16:16.639 --> 16:19.342
You're just going to
sit here and smoke?

16:19.376 --> 16:20.810
No, I'm not just going to
sit here and smoke, okay?

16:20.843 --> 16:22.879
Come on. Hurry up.

16:31.656 --> 16:35.425
Okay.
So, I'm going to get the number seven,

16:35.458 --> 16:36.728
the barbecued pork sandwich,
and...

16:36.761 --> 16:39.430
Iris?

16:39.463 --> 16:41.900
And what do you want,
a number 11?

16:41.932 --> 16:43.301
I don't know.
Is that what you want?

16:43.334 --> 16:44.369
Yeah.

16:44.402 --> 16:46.404
Are you sure?

16:46.437 --> 16:48.573
Iris, what do you want?

16:48.607 --> 16:49.975
Just pick one.

16:50.008 --> 16:51.377
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:53.680 --> 16:54.982
This is...

16:56.581 --> 16:57.951
Well, what are you
doing here?

16:57.984 --> 16:59.953
Uh, I'm just on a break,
actually, from work.

16:59.985 --> 17:01.754
I need to get back. But, uh...

17:01.787 --> 17:03.690
That's so funny.

17:03.723 --> 17:05.058
Yeah. We probably should've
known this was going to happen.

17:05.091 --> 17:08.062
Ah, it's Winnipeg,
right?

17:08.094 --> 17:09.630
Winnipeg, yeah.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.666
Yeah.
You were literally...

17:12.699 --> 17:15.001
Yeah. I was just literally
thinking about the other night.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.303
So, that was...

17:16.337 --> 17:17.506
Oh, crazy. Yeah.

17:18.573 --> 17:20.641
Yeah. Me, too. I was,
uh, thinking about you.

17:20.675 --> 17:23.745
Uh,

17:23.777 --> 17:26.614
do you, uh...

17:26.648 --> 17:27.815
Can I give you
my number?

17:27.849 --> 17:29.786
Just if, like...

17:29.818 --> 17:31.988
- I mean...
- Or should we, like...

17:32.020 --> 17:33.922
I don't know.

17:33.956 --> 17:36.892
Did we go too far?
I would get it.

17:36.926 --> 17:39.929
'Cause we did. We put...
I put a lot out there,

17:39.961 --> 17:41.898
and if I heard all that
from someone

17:41.931 --> 17:44.067
- maybe I would not like them.
- No, no, no.

17:44.101 --> 17:46.070
I would understand
if you hate me.

17:46.103 --> 17:48.005
I'm very hateable.
It's my superpower.

17:48.037 --> 17:49.839
No. I mean, we're here now,

17:49.873 --> 17:51.075
so I guess
it cancels it out.

17:51.107 --> 17:52.475
So...

17:52.508 --> 17:54.712
Okay, yeah. No.

17:54.746 --> 17:55.913
Yeah? Okay.

17:55.947 --> 17:57.615
Yes. I would...
That would be...

17:57.647 --> 17:58.982
- That's a...
- Here.

17:59.016 --> 18:01.419
So, you can just, like, call me,
and then...

18:01.451 --> 18:03.755
Cool.

18:03.788 --> 18:05.657
I think it'll ring

18:05.691 --> 18:08.928
in three, two...

18:08.961 --> 18:11.396
There you go.

18:11.430 --> 18:13.132
Yep. There it is.

18:13.164 --> 18:14.500
- Hello?
- Hi.

18:14.532 --> 18:17.136
- Yeah.
- It's good.

18:17.170 --> 18:19.506
- Well?
- It's working.

18:19.539 --> 18:21.942
I guess I'll talk to you
in a bit.

18:21.974 --> 18:24.711
Yeah. Whenever, or never, or...
Yeah, sure.

18:24.743 --> 18:27.079
- Okay.
- Great.

18:46.534 --> 18:47.835
Oh, I knew it!

18:47.869 --> 18:49.538
What?
It's legal now.

19:48.602 --> 19:50.537
- Hi.
- Hey.

19:50.569 --> 19:52.605
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

19:52.639 --> 19:54.642
- How you doing?
- Good.

19:54.674 --> 19:56.510
That's good.

19:56.544 --> 19:57.778

21:06.719 --> 21:08.822
Joni Mitchell.

21:08.854 --> 21:11.558
Joni is a national treasure.

21:11.592 --> 21:13.294
Preach.

21:13.326 --> 21:15.328
Am I being judged
right now?

21:15.361 --> 21:17.798
Yeah.

21:17.832 --> 21:18.867
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

21:18.900 --> 21:19.901
Oh.

21:21.102 --> 21:23.237
♪ Find me where to work,
it's all work and no Play-Doh ♪

21:23.270 --> 21:25.239
Well, don't stop here. I have
an entire apartment of things

21:25.273 --> 21:27.275
just waiting
to be judged by you.

21:27.307 --> 21:28.809
Okay. Let's see.

21:28.844 --> 21:30.246
You've got some more tapes,

21:30.278 --> 21:34.115
CDs and this thing.

21:34.149 --> 21:35.151
What is this thing?

21:35.183 --> 21:36.251
It looks like it's
about to fall.

21:36.285 --> 21:40.256
That thing is
a weird bowl, obviously.

21:40.288 --> 21:43.125
And it's intentionally
placed that way

21:43.159 --> 21:45.295
so that when the world
tilts out of balance

21:45.327 --> 21:48.197
I will have
advance warning.

21:48.230 --> 21:51.335
Obviously.

21:51.367 --> 21:52.803
Is that yours?

21:52.836 --> 21:54.172
Yeah.

21:54.204 --> 21:58.141
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
It's real.

21:58.174 --> 22:01.011
Yeah, yeah. I know.
It's not just a prop.

22:01.045 --> 22:02.212
Whoa.

22:02.246 --> 22:03.881
Can I?

22:03.913 --> 22:06.018
First time in the apartment.
Just straight to the bass, huh?

22:06.050 --> 22:07.218
I don't know
a lot of people

22:07.251 --> 22:08.820
that have
their own upright bass.

22:08.854 --> 22:10.088
Fair enough.

22:10.122 --> 22:11.757
Do you play it?

22:11.789 --> 22:14.292
I play, like, uh,
two notes pretty well.

22:14.326 --> 22:15.894
That's pretty good.
Let's hear it.

22:15.926 --> 22:17.162
Oh, yeah. No, no.

22:17.195 --> 22:20.165
Not, like, on request
or anything like that.

22:20.198 --> 22:22.935
It's not
a solo instrument.

22:22.969 --> 22:26.306
You play the bass with
other people and it, uh,

22:26.338 --> 22:30.276
connects you in a deeper,
almost spiritual way.

22:30.310 --> 22:31.678
Sort of, like, uh...

22:31.712 --> 22:32.713
Two notes.

22:32.745 --> 22:34.047
What? Do you play?

22:34.080 --> 22:36.149
I'm a singer, yeah.

22:36.183 --> 22:37.917
I play guitar,
but I don't play bass.

22:37.951 --> 22:39.387
- Really?
- Yeah.

22:39.419 --> 22:40.821
I've always wanted to,
you know,

22:40.854 --> 22:42.055
play shows on my own,
and...

22:42.090 --> 22:44.126
Well, then, I am definitely not
playing this thing for you.

22:44.158 --> 22:46.962
- Oh, come on. Two notes. That's pretty good.
- Two notes, yeah.

22:46.994 --> 22:48.696
When I'm at, like,
10 to 15 notes,

22:48.729 --> 22:50.431
then I'm going to leave you
with your own personal solo.

22:50.465 --> 22:52.234
No, but...

22:52.266 --> 22:54.069
But no, no, I can't.
I can't. I can't.

22:54.102 --> 22:56.038
Come on.
It's two notes.

22:56.072 --> 22:57.974
Do you hear that?

22:58.006 --> 22:59.976
Snowplow.

23:00.008 --> 23:02.245
Let's go.

23:06.949 --> 23:08.751
Oh, there he is.

23:08.785 --> 23:10.254
There he is.

23:10.286 --> 23:13.090
You got to watch this, 'cause
what I love about this guy

23:13.122 --> 23:14.224
is that some guys
are just clearing snow,

23:14.257 --> 23:16.760
but you can tell that
this guy loves what he's doing.

23:16.794 --> 23:18.697
- Mm-hmm?
- Yeah, okay.

23:18.729 --> 23:19.698
- Hold on.
- What?

23:19.730 --> 23:21.398
Well, he's going to do,
like, a 360 little move.

23:21.431 --> 23:22.433
Just watch.

23:25.001 --> 23:28.205
Yeah. Artistry.

23:53.267 --> 23:55.336
Ooh.

23:55.368 --> 23:59.406
Just so you know, we're
not having sex tonight.

24:01.241 --> 24:02.976
Which means that we are
on another night?

24:08.250 --> 24:09.351
But you didn't?

24:09.384 --> 24:10.419
Yeah, but we will.

24:10.452 --> 24:12.820
When?

24:12.854 --> 24:13.789
Yeah. I don't know.

24:13.821 --> 24:16.357
Like, at some point
in the future, I guess.

24:16.390 --> 24:19.895
But, like, I can't believe how
good it is when we're together.

24:19.928 --> 24:20.829
Like, she's just so playful...

24:20.864 --> 24:22.465
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Totally get it. Come on.

24:22.498 --> 24:24.200
...and just so willing
to jump into stuff,

24:24.233 --> 24:25.769
and we just, like, absolutely...

24:25.801 --> 24:28.370
Look. Your story
is amazing. Seriously.

24:28.404 --> 24:30.307
I'm so enthralled by it.
But right now, save my life.

24:30.340 --> 24:33.010
Yeah, okay.

24:33.042 --> 24:35.346
Oof. Okay. All right.
That was okay.

24:35.378 --> 24:37.148
That was close.
Maybe a little lower.

24:37.180 --> 24:40.818
Yeah. All right.
Again?

24:40.851 --> 24:44.488
It's just, like, I have not been
in this situation before

24:44.522 --> 24:48.960
where I don't know what
she really wants, ultimately.

24:48.993 --> 24:51.530
And it's just... I wouldn't
blame her if she thinks...

24:51.562 --> 24:54.967
Shh, shh. Look at me.
Look at me.

24:54.999 --> 24:58.336
You're beautiful.
You're what every man wants.

24:58.370 --> 25:02.375
Now give me
the Heimlich, okay?

25:02.408 --> 25:03.642
And... Oof. Okay.
I deserved that.

25:03.676 --> 25:06.980
Yeah. I'm just going to break
a rib or something like that.

25:07.013 --> 25:08.982
Show me how it's done,
and then...

25:09.015 --> 25:11.951
All right. Ready?

25:11.985 --> 25:14.021
I guess, yeah.

25:18.625 --> 25:23.131
Ooh!
I can't tell if that's working.

25:23.163 --> 25:26.200
I need it to work,
all right?

25:26.234 --> 25:28.269
What happened?

25:28.302 --> 25:30.104
I went to the porno
the other day, right?

25:30.137 --> 25:32.240
Oh, my God. You actually
went through with it?

25:32.274 --> 25:35.044
- I went through with it.
- What was it like?

25:35.076 --> 25:36.979
It was weird.
It was weird as fuck, man.

25:37.011 --> 25:39.047
You...

25:39.081 --> 25:40.449
And what'd they
make you do?

25:40.481 --> 25:43.019
I don't want to talk about
the porn, man.

25:43.051 --> 25:44.154
What I want to talk to you
about is

25:44.186 --> 25:45.621
I go to
the craft services table, right?

25:45.654 --> 25:47.289
I'm just eating some food,
and this dude comes next to me

25:47.323 --> 25:49.626
and he starts
fucking choking, man.

25:49.659 --> 25:51.928
He chokes
and he falls to the ground

25:51.961 --> 25:54.999
and I'm sitting there
looking at him, and I just...

25:55.031 --> 25:56.032
I froze.

25:56.066 --> 25:57.201
Right.

25:57.233 --> 25:58.401
And that
could have been you.

25:58.434 --> 25:59.470
That could've been you
sitting there.

25:59.502 --> 26:01.571
And you're choking and
I'm sitting there freezing,

26:01.605 --> 26:04.877
and what if
nobody comes, right?

26:04.909 --> 26:06.978
So, what?
He just kept choking?

26:07.011 --> 26:09.080
No, man. Someone came
and saved him eventually.

26:09.114 --> 26:11.216
It just wasn't me,
right? And I just...

26:11.249 --> 26:14.252
I don't want to be
the guy

26:14.286 --> 26:16.221
that's remembered
for standing next to

26:16.253 --> 26:18.358
the person who died,
you know?

26:18.390 --> 26:19.591
Okay. I don't think
I'm going to choke, man.

26:19.625 --> 26:20.993
This isn't a porno set.

26:21.026 --> 26:22.461
Just trust me.

26:22.494 --> 26:24.162
- Oh! We're not doing that again.
- You okay?

26:24.195 --> 26:25.231
Okay.
Well, come to...

26:25.263 --> 26:26.365
Let's take a class.
You and me.

26:26.398 --> 26:27.566
I'm not going to do that.
It's not going to happen.

26:27.599 --> 26:30.337
What if I'm the one? What if
I'm sitting on the floor, huh?

26:30.369 --> 26:31.872
Well, I'm never going to be
on the porno s...

26:34.975 --> 26:36.010
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:36.042 --> 26:37.444
Yeah.
Sorry I'm late.

26:37.476 --> 26:39.513
Just got a little bit
of time, break from work.

26:39.545 --> 26:40.614
Yeah? Cool.

26:40.648 --> 26:42.149
Uh, what do you got
so far?

26:42.182 --> 26:45.252
I'm just looking at how much
the hall actually costs.

26:45.285 --> 26:47.354
Which? Which one?

26:47.388 --> 26:49.591
Petrus. I think
Agnes mentioned that...

26:49.623 --> 26:50.691
Yeah.
That was one of them.

26:50.725 --> 26:52.060
There was a few others,
too, though.

26:52.092 --> 26:53.094
But have you done
anything, like...

26:53.128 --> 26:54.397
Uh, yeah.

26:54.429 --> 26:55.698
...planning-for-the-budget
wise?

26:55.730 --> 26:59.367
Mmm, yes. I did create,
like, a chart.

26:59.400 --> 27:02.337
Okay. I'm just going to
come over there.

27:02.371 --> 27:06.310
Okay. Uh, what's this?

27:06.343 --> 27:08.277
Agnes left you a folder just so
you have something to look over.

27:08.311 --> 27:11.048
Oh, okay. Great.
Cool.

27:11.081 --> 27:13.216
And, uh, is this
the same thing here?

27:13.248 --> 27:14.718
Yep, should be about the same.

27:14.750 --> 27:16.385
Okay, okay.

27:16.419 --> 27:20.224
So, uh, tell me about this
Petrus Hall, I guess.

27:20.257 --> 27:21.426
Yeah.
It's really huge.

27:21.459 --> 27:22.626
Have you,
besides this,

27:22.660 --> 27:23.527
have you, like,
looked at anything?

27:23.560 --> 27:25.395
Is there anything else
that we've, like...

27:25.429 --> 27:26.998
Well, I tried to look at
other stuff,

27:27.030 --> 27:28.365
but this is the hall
that she really wants to use.

27:28.399 --> 27:29.701
Okay. Here. I'm just
going to grab this.

27:33.337 --> 27:36.141
Okay. And you have
the DJ filled out already?

27:36.173 --> 27:38.443
Oh, yeah. I talked to a friend,
and I'm pretty sure

27:38.477 --> 27:40.446
I can get him for $500,
so I just put it in there.

27:40.480 --> 27:42.582
- You're pretty sure?
- Yeah, pretty sure.

27:42.615 --> 27:44.250
Okay. Well, if we go with
a DJ, that's good to know.

27:44.282 --> 27:46.251
I really appreciate that.
That's awesome.

27:46.285 --> 27:48.021
Oh, well, thanks.

27:48.054 --> 27:51.423
Uh, can I just say something?

27:51.456 --> 27:53.560
I really feel
uncomfortable

27:53.594 --> 27:57.298
when you get really close
and start to touch me.

27:57.330 --> 28:00.533
Uh, I'm sorry.

28:00.567 --> 28:02.269
I didn't mean
anything by it.

28:02.301 --> 28:03.370
I'm just being friendly.
I'm sorry.

28:03.404 --> 28:04.438
Oh, okay.

28:04.472 --> 28:05.773
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's fine.

28:05.807 --> 28:07.576
- No, no. I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable.
- Yeah. Sorry.

28:07.608 --> 28:08.710
I'm just, like, you're going to
be my sister-in-law.

28:08.742 --> 28:10.145
I just, you know...
Sorry. I just...

28:10.177 --> 28:11.312
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, sorry.

28:11.346 --> 28:12.614
No, no. It's all good.
It's all good.

28:12.646 --> 28:15.117
- Um, really appreciate the DJ.
- Yeah.

28:15.149 --> 28:17.019
That's gonna be awesome. If you
could contact Petrus Hall,

28:17.052 --> 28:18.253
I gotta get back to work.

28:18.286 --> 28:19.688
- So, is that cool?
- Yep.

28:19.722 --> 28:21.491
Great. Awesome.
Thank you so much.

28:28.196 --> 28:30.700
The theme of the social
is going to be Hollywood.

28:30.734 --> 28:33.404
Ooh, Hollywood? Woo!

28:33.437 --> 28:36.139
Yeah, like red carpet.

28:36.173 --> 28:39.276
Justin's friends
want to do live karaoke.

28:39.309 --> 28:40.210
They suggested that.

28:40.244 --> 28:43.081
Oh, no, no, no, Papa.
There you go again.

28:43.113 --> 28:45.616
No.
You can't just do that.

28:45.649 --> 28:47.718
No, Mom.
You should hear Justin sing.

28:49.352 --> 28:52.157
Yeah. His voice is so...
It's so honest.

28:52.189 --> 28:53.258
Ugh.

28:53.292 --> 28:55.194
Iris...

28:58.162 --> 28:59.230
What's your problem?

28:59.264 --> 29:00.399
Something's wrong?

29:00.431 --> 29:02.267
Oh, no, no. Sorry.

29:02.301 --> 29:04.270
Oh, no, no. I heard you.

29:05.572 --> 29:07.373
Nothing, nothing.
I'm sorry.

29:07.407 --> 29:08.542
I just... I got to go.

29:08.574 --> 29:10.844
Uh, you know,
Iris,

29:10.876 --> 29:13.180
we're busy here, okay?

29:15.448 --> 29:16.248
I just heard you.

29:16.282 --> 29:18.119
What's that?

29:19.652 --> 29:21.354
Nothing.

29:21.387 --> 29:22.556
You never help us here.

29:25.558 --> 29:27.795
But something's wrong.

29:34.903 --> 29:36.238
Here, Mom.

29:38.339 --> 29:40.341
Iris...

29:42.511 --> 29:46.316
See? We're so busy here
talking about...

29:47.916 --> 29:49.618
but you still have
this attitude.

29:51.420 --> 29:53.390
Speak up.

29:53.423 --> 29:55.559
Speak up.

29:55.591 --> 29:57.127
It's nothing, Ma.
It's nothing. Sorry.

29:57.161 --> 29:59.530
Sorry.
I just have to be somewhere.

29:59.562 --> 30:00.763
I'm sorry.

30:00.797 --> 30:02.266
No. We are talking
about your...

30:02.299 --> 30:04.470
Iris!

30:07.839 --> 30:09.608
Why do you always
have to be like this?

30:09.640 --> 30:12.343
Me? You should ask Mom
why she's always such a bitch.

30:12.377 --> 30:14.646
Oh, so you
throwing all the attitude

30:14.678 --> 30:16.615
wasn't you
being a bitch?

30:16.648 --> 30:19.185
She's always picking on me.
It's always me, right?

30:19.217 --> 30:21.521
Yeah, because you're
the one with the problem.

30:21.553 --> 30:24.290
I do not have a problem,
for fuck's sake.

30:24.322 --> 30:27.159
What is wrong?

30:27.193 --> 30:29.562
Does it ever
fucking bother you

30:29.595 --> 30:33.833
how Justin is so touchy
with every girl he meets?

30:33.867 --> 30:35.302
No.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.236
That's just him.

30:37.270 --> 30:40.174
Of course.

30:41.842 --> 30:45.380
Iris, you know, just because
you had a failed relationship

30:45.412 --> 30:47.214
doesn't mean you have to
take it out on mine.

30:47.247 --> 30:48.650
We're all happy here,

30:48.682 --> 30:49.816
and you're the only one
that's upset

30:49.850 --> 30:51.619
that all of this
is happening.

30:51.651 --> 30:53.354
You know what?
Forget it.

30:53.388 --> 30:56.626
Thanks a lot,
Agnes.

31:11.274 --> 31:14.811
Somewhere right around here.

31:14.844 --> 31:16.681
So, in such a way
that the angle is

31:16.713 --> 31:21.451
sort of like right into
there, the corner pocket.

31:21.485 --> 31:25.790
So, you kind of back it up
and, uh...

31:25.823 --> 31:28.226
Iris.

31:30.561 --> 31:32.396
What are you doing?

31:32.430 --> 31:34.333
What did you tell Agnes

31:34.365 --> 31:36.500
about what happened
the other day?

31:36.534 --> 31:38.637
- What do you mean?
- What did you tell her?

31:38.670 --> 31:42.842
I just told her how I didn't
feel comfortable about,

31:42.875 --> 31:45.244
well,
how close you get...

31:45.278 --> 31:46.613
Okay, but did you
tell her about

31:46.645 --> 31:47.914
how we were
cool afterwards?

31:47.946 --> 31:49.248
How it was
a misunderstanding?

31:49.281 --> 31:51.384
- No, I didn't.
- Why not?

31:51.416 --> 31:53.520
Because that's
how we left things,

31:53.552 --> 31:57.590
and then you tell her that
I was being inappropriate?

31:57.624 --> 32:00.627
I didn't... She told me
it was... Like, she understood.

32:00.661 --> 32:02.596
Like, I thought that
I just left it off that way.

32:02.628 --> 32:04.299
I didn't think it was
such a big deal.

32:04.331 --> 32:05.367
No. It's apparently
a bigger deal

32:05.399 --> 32:06.467
than you thought
it was.

32:06.501 --> 32:07.735
She said it was fine.

32:07.769 --> 32:10.305
I don't know if that's actually
what you told her or not, okay?

32:10.338 --> 32:12.706
No. I told her exactly
what I thought.

32:12.740 --> 32:14.476
- That we had...
- I didn't exactly have...

32:14.509 --> 32:16.512
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:16.544 --> 32:18.848
What's up?

32:18.880 --> 32:20.283
Oh, yeah. This is Justin,
my brother-in-law.

32:20.315 --> 32:21.449
- Hey.
- Simon.

32:21.483 --> 32:22.851
Brother-in-law.

32:22.885 --> 32:24.587
Hey.

32:24.619 --> 32:26.455
He's my boyfriend.

32:26.487 --> 32:28.023
Cool.

32:28.056 --> 32:29.592
Good to meet you.

32:29.626 --> 32:31.461
Yeah. Good to meet you,
too.

32:31.494 --> 32:34.697
Well, uh,

32:34.730 --> 32:36.065
don't let me interrupt.

32:36.099 --> 32:38.968
Um, cool.

32:39.002 --> 32:41.006
Yeah. Thanks.

32:46.009 --> 32:48.078
You okay?

32:48.112 --> 32:51.748
Yeah. Just...

32:51.782 --> 32:54.987
So, uh, boyfriend?

32:55.019 --> 32:57.889
Yeah.

32:57.922 --> 33:00.092
It kind of just slipped out.
Sorry.

33:00.124 --> 33:02.361
Oh. It's just...

33:02.393 --> 33:05.431
From over there, I was
looking at the two of you

33:05.464 --> 33:06.766
and it kind of
looked like, um...

33:08.601 --> 33:10.103
He was my boyfriend?

33:10.135 --> 33:12.971
Where I was standing, it kind of
looked like he could've been.

33:13.005 --> 33:14.107
Oh, God, no.

33:14.140 --> 33:17.812
Okay. Uh, I was...
Too good to be true.

33:20.713 --> 33:22.048
Really?

33:22.082 --> 33:23.784
Yeah.

33:23.817 --> 33:27.355
So, um,

33:27.387 --> 33:30.024
that means, uh...

33:30.058 --> 33:32.560
What?

33:58.722 --> 34:01.425
Uh, hold on.
Hold on. Hold on.

34:01.457 --> 34:04.428
I just need to tell you
something quick.

34:04.462 --> 34:06.465
Okay.

34:09.500 --> 34:11.469
Like, I need to...

34:11.502 --> 34:12.637
Oh, like, you want to...

34:12.670 --> 34:13.872
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

34:13.904 --> 34:15.639
Okay. Sorry.

34:19.111 --> 34:21.114
Okay.

34:22.113 --> 34:23.849
I used to be married.

34:25.950 --> 34:27.686
Like, years ago.

34:27.718 --> 34:31.424
It lasted, like, nine months
and then he left.

34:33.625 --> 34:37.897
Uh, whoa.

34:37.931 --> 34:40.767
Yeah.

34:40.800 --> 34:44.538
Um, are you still married?

34:44.572 --> 34:46.541
Oh, no, no, no.
Not anymore.

34:46.574 --> 34:47.909
Not at all.
That's done.

34:51.045 --> 34:54.183
Okay, and that's, like,
behind you and everything?

34:54.216 --> 34:57.685
Yes.

34:57.718 --> 34:59.954
I mean, at this point,
you could have said something

34:59.988 --> 35:01.556
a lot worse
than that.

35:01.589 --> 35:06.128
So, if you're okay,
I'm okay.

35:06.161 --> 35:08.197
Okay.

35:08.231 --> 35:10.566
Okay.

35:10.599 --> 35:13.936
Although, like, um,

35:13.969 --> 35:15.938
if that's the conversation
we're having,

35:15.972 --> 35:18.676
I mean,
I should tell you that

35:18.709 --> 35:20.810
I've been with
more than one person.

35:20.843 --> 35:23.613
I've been with,
like, 30 people.

35:31.288 --> 35:32.957
Okay.

35:36.159 --> 35:38.163
Okay.

36:07.662 --> 36:08.863
Man, your eyes look weird
upside down.

36:08.896 --> 36:10.631
Your eyes look weird
upside down.

36:14.802 --> 36:17.739
So, you, uh...

36:17.772 --> 36:19.274
...you didn't come there, hey?

36:19.308 --> 36:23.012
No. It's a thing.

36:24.846 --> 36:26.849
Right.

36:32.854 --> 36:35.559
So, like, exactly 30?

36:35.592 --> 36:36.793
Or...

37:04.689 --> 37:05.825
Okay. You know
what you're doing?

37:05.857 --> 37:07.026
I kind of know
what I'm doing.

37:07.058 --> 37:08.093
You kind of know
what you're doing?

37:08.127 --> 37:09.929
This is an important skill
to learn, and I'm trying...

37:09.962 --> 37:11.730
Oh, my God.
Okay.

37:11.763 --> 37:13.799
And this goes here,
and then you're choking,

37:13.832 --> 37:15.000
and it's kind of
like a...-

37:15.033 --> 37:16.603
Ooh.

37:16.637 --> 37:18.839
Oh, I see what you're
trying to do here, buddy.

37:18.871 --> 37:20.173
What's wrong?
What am I trying to do?

37:20.206 --> 37:23.210
Ah.

37:23.242 --> 37:24.076
You don't seem to care
about it.

37:24.110 --> 37:25.980
Yeah, 'cause I'm
a private person. No.

37:26.012 --> 37:27.748
I definitely don't care, you've
absolutely got that right.

37:27.780 --> 37:29.017
You don't care
about me.

37:29.049 --> 37:30.352
No. It's not that
I don't care about you.

37:30.385 --> 37:33.921
I'm going to give you this.

37:33.955 --> 37:36.391
Really?
What is this?

37:36.423 --> 37:37.892
Just a little
day-brightener.

37:44.433 --> 37:48.070
Really?
Joni?

37:48.103 --> 37:50.172
Yeah, Joni.

37:50.204 --> 37:52.975
I have a surprise.

37:53.008 --> 37:55.012
Hmm.

38:02.686 --> 38:03.820
Just a little mixtape
for you.

38:03.852 --> 38:05.989
Wait a second.
Did you make this?

38:06.022 --> 38:07.925
Whoa!

38:12.328 --> 38:14.365
Is this
what I think it is?

38:19.970 --> 38:22.840
Oh, my God!
This is so cute.

38:22.874 --> 38:25.711
A new
bullshit planner.

38:25.744 --> 38:28.080
You remembered.

38:28.114 --> 38:30.283
I remembered, yeah.

38:30.315 --> 38:33.687
What the fuck do you mean,
you're in love?

38:33.719 --> 38:36.355
Like, it's been going good
and the feeling is growing

38:36.388 --> 38:41.295
and now when she's not around, I
think I'm in love.

38:41.327 --> 38:43.163
Well, how do you know it's love?
Are you sure it's love?

38:43.197 --> 38:44.331
Are you sure
it's not something else?

38:44.363 --> 38:45.766
What else would it be?

38:45.798 --> 38:46.967
Maybe it's a different emotion.

38:46.999 --> 38:48.469
Maybe you're really angry.

38:48.501 --> 38:49.536
You know, those parts
in your brain

38:49.570 --> 38:51.338
are actually really
close together: love, anger.

38:51.371 --> 38:53.709
- People get confused all the time.
- No, man.

38:53.741 --> 38:55.810
It's...
That's what it is.

38:55.843 --> 38:58.446
That's dramatic.
Nobody is in love anymore.

38:58.480 --> 39:00.315
You know who's in love?
15-year-old girls.

39:00.348 --> 39:01.983
That's who falls in love.

39:02.015 --> 39:03.784
No, man.

39:03.817 --> 39:05.221
I think I want us to move
in together. I don't know.

39:05.253 --> 39:06.288
You're just going
to say...

39:06.322 --> 39:07.890
But you barely know this.
You're going to say it?

39:07.923 --> 39:09.525
You're just going to
come out and say,

39:09.557 --> 39:12.228
- "Let's move in together"?
- Well, I agree that's what I need to figure out, but...

39:12.260 --> 39:13.996
How ridiculous
does that sound?

39:15.798 --> 39:18.235
Whoa, whoa.
You're trying to

39:18.267 --> 39:19.302
bring them back to life,
not kill them.

39:19.336 --> 39:21.171
If you do it faster, they
come back to life faster.

39:21.203 --> 39:22.272
Everybody knows this.

39:22.305 --> 39:23.774
100% not a thing.

39:24.841 --> 39:29.247
So, you think
I'm moving too fast?

39:29.279 --> 39:30.915
I think you're moving
way too fast.

39:30.947 --> 39:33.150
- You think I need to take time?
- Yes.

39:33.183 --> 39:35.119
I'll take time.
I'll leave the city.

39:35.152 --> 39:36.987
- Yes.
- Go on a trip.

39:37.020 --> 39:38.388
Yes! Leave the city.

39:38.422 --> 39:40.392
Go on a trip. Go...
We could do a road trip.

39:40.425 --> 39:41.760
Do you want to go on
a road trip?

39:41.794 --> 39:43.295
Not us. We're not both
going to do it.

39:43.327 --> 39:45.130
What, you don't want to
hang out with me?

39:45.164 --> 39:47.265
We spend a lot of time
together and also,

39:47.298 --> 39:48.434
I think what we're
talking about right now

39:48.466 --> 39:49.901
is me spending time
to myself

39:49.934 --> 39:51.070
trying to figure out
what it is I want

39:51.102 --> 39:54.373
and giving her the space
to figure out what she wants,

39:54.406 --> 39:56.208
and then coming back at it
with some intention.

39:56.241 --> 39:57.476
I think
it's a good idea.

39:57.509 --> 39:59.411
Yeah, it's a good idea.

39:59.444 --> 40:00.479
It's not a bad idea.

40:00.513 --> 40:03.049
It's a good
fucking idea.

40:03.081 --> 40:04.151
This thing is not
fucking working for me.

40:04.184 --> 40:05.519
Yeah.
I don't want to use these, okay?

40:05.553 --> 40:06.921
Just get rid of this,
quick.

40:06.954 --> 40:07.955
What are you doing?

40:07.988 --> 40:09.791
Shh, shh. Just do it on me.
Just do it on me.

40:09.823 --> 40:10.892
No. I'm not going to
do it on you.

40:10.925 --> 40:11.926
Come on. Just give me this.

40:11.959 --> 40:13.060
'Cause you're
just going to, um...

40:13.093 --> 40:14.128
No, come on. Just...

40:14.160 --> 40:16.198
This is an actual class
that you wanted to go to.

40:16.230 --> 40:17.565
You're going to get us
kicked out.

40:17.598 --> 40:20.134
- We're not going to get kicked out.
- Yeah, we are.

40:20.167 --> 40:22.370
We're going to get extra credit.

40:22.404 --> 40:24.139
We're supposed to be using
a mask and a mannequin.

40:24.172 --> 40:25.474
Exactly.
A mannequin, okay?

40:25.507 --> 40:27.009
A mannequin is not going to be
dying on the street.

40:27.042 --> 40:28.878
I'm not going to do this
right now with you, okay?

40:28.910 --> 40:29.778
You're a fucking coward.
You're being a coward.

40:29.811 --> 40:31.514
- I dare you.
- I'm not being a coward.

40:31.546 --> 40:32.981
- Oh, my God.
- Do it. Do it. Come on.

40:33.014 --> 40:36.853
Just shut up. Just shut up.
Shh. Okay. 30.

40:36.885 --> 40:38.021
Ready?

40:38.054 --> 40:39.957
Open the airway.

40:39.989 --> 40:42.058
Let's take
the mask off the face.

40:48.631 --> 40:49.866
Do you have an erection
right now?

40:49.899 --> 40:50.901
No.

40:50.933 --> 40:52.137
You do, though.
Oh, my God.

40:52.170 --> 40:53.537
It's not...

40:53.570 --> 40:54.873
It's not for you.

40:54.905 --> 40:56.909
Don't flatter yourself.

41:00.077 --> 41:01.313
Hey. Keep going, everybody.

41:13.524 --> 41:18.232
You must have a boarding
pass and photo ID before entering...

41:18.264 --> 41:19.465
Boo.

41:21.934 --> 41:23.938
Um, I... All right.

41:28.109 --> 41:29.310
Hi.

41:29.343 --> 41:30.879
- Where's mine?
- Thanks for, uh...

41:30.912 --> 41:32.580
Well, I didn't know
if you wanted to start

41:32.613 --> 41:33.948
as early as I have.

41:33.981 --> 41:36.618
So, welcome to here.

41:36.651 --> 41:41.490
Is this one of your spots
to just chill, or...

41:41.523 --> 41:44.460
Uh, no. Not actually.

41:44.493 --> 41:46.261
No. This is all sort of
out of the blue for me.

41:46.295 --> 41:47.496
Is that yours?

41:49.264 --> 41:50.633
Yep.

41:50.665 --> 41:52.167
Oh.

41:52.200 --> 41:55.137
I'll just jump into it.
I'm going on a trip.

41:55.171 --> 41:56.339
Today.

41:56.372 --> 41:57.540
Oh.

41:57.573 --> 41:59.209
- Which is...
- Today, today.

41:59.242 --> 42:01.444
Yeah, as spontaneous
as it sounds.

42:01.477 --> 42:04.014
- But I...
- Hmm.

42:04.047 --> 42:05.448
I want you to,
you know,

42:05.482 --> 42:09.420
And you want me
to go with you?

42:09.453 --> 42:11.656
Cool.
I brought my passport.

42:11.688 --> 42:13.658
Crazy. Uh...

42:13.690 --> 42:17.528
I mean, I figured,
"Meet at the airport"...

42:17.561 --> 42:18.997
I just thought,
in case...

42:21.599 --> 42:25.102
Oh, man. Um...

42:25.135 --> 42:28.274
Sorry. I, uh,

42:28.306 --> 42:30.575
bought a ticket

42:30.609 --> 42:33.613
to go on a trip, like,

42:33.645 --> 42:36.415
just, like, on my own.

42:39.417 --> 42:40.720
You're kidding.

42:40.753 --> 42:42.322
I'm sorry. I...
No, no. I...

42:42.356 --> 42:43.958
- No. You're kidding.
- I really did not...

42:43.990 --> 42:45.224
Yeah, I'm sorry.
No. I just...

42:45.257 --> 42:47.293
You're not kidding.
Holy.

42:47.327 --> 42:49.496
Let me start again.

42:49.528 --> 42:53.667
I love what's going on
between you and I,

42:53.700 --> 42:57.204
and this is part of that.
This is...

42:57.238 --> 43:01.408
I feel seriously
about this.

43:01.442 --> 43:03.646
Simon, if you need to break up
with me you can just do it.

43:03.679 --> 43:06.983
Whoa!
That is, so, so far.

43:07.016 --> 43:08.416
Please don't think that.

43:08.449 --> 43:10.552
If I've said anything
that makes you think that,

43:10.585 --> 43:12.420
forget it.

43:12.454 --> 43:13.756
What? You're going
on a trip. You're not...

43:13.788 --> 43:17.226
Look. Here's the thing.
I'll eat my ticket.

43:17.260 --> 43:19.662
I'll literally eat my ticket
if you don't want me to go

43:19.696 --> 43:23.533
because you think it's...
I just think

43:23.566 --> 43:26.435
if we do this... And I know
it's a crazy choice,

43:26.468 --> 43:28.638
but it'll be
this opportunity for us

43:28.672 --> 43:32.710
to make this into
something more intentional.

43:32.743 --> 43:35.045
So, it's like stretching
our wings, right?

43:35.078 --> 43:36.313
It's like sowing
the wild oats

43:36.346 --> 43:39.049
and then coming back
to something

43:39.083 --> 43:41.086
that we really understand
and have perspective on.

43:41.119 --> 43:42.287
But wouldn't that
just poison everything?

43:42.320 --> 43:43.622
Wouldn't that just...

43:43.655 --> 43:47.292
I don't think it will.

43:47.325 --> 43:51.598
But it'd be worth knowing,
no matter what, right?

43:53.565 --> 43:55.368
Will anything that I say
make a difference at all, or...

43:55.400 --> 43:57.803
Like, do I get to
say anything?

43:57.837 --> 44:00.407
Absolutely, absolutely.
Because...

44:00.440 --> 44:02.775
- 'Cause...
- Yes, you absolutely have a say

44:02.808 --> 44:04.378
if you want.

44:04.410 --> 44:06.746
Okay.

44:06.780 --> 44:08.082
I mean, you and I
are the most important...

44:08.115 --> 44:10.217
- Yeah. Just give me a...
- Yeah.

44:10.249 --> 44:13.053
Let me think
about this.

44:14.253 --> 44:16.624
You're going to...

44:16.658 --> 44:19.527
Okay, yep.
Take five on that.

44:38.246 --> 44:39.682
It's a wild choice.

44:39.716 --> 44:44.555
So, let's do it.

45:01.739 --> 45:03.407
What else
did he say?

45:03.440 --> 45:06.111
He said that
he just needed to go,

45:06.144 --> 45:09.114
and we needed to sow
our wild oats or something.

45:09.147 --> 45:10.316
Who says that?

45:10.348 --> 45:13.184
Simon.

45:13.218 --> 45:15.488
Why? What did you do?
Did you do something?

45:15.521 --> 45:17.491
No. Like, it was just...
Everything was going fine.

45:17.523 --> 45:18.891
I don't know.

45:18.924 --> 45:20.593
Maybe he's just afraid that
it was getting too real.

45:20.627 --> 45:23.762
So, what?
Then you came home after?

45:23.795 --> 45:26.732
Yeah. I just came home
and I let him go.

45:26.766 --> 45:28.836
And then,
I don't know...

45:28.868 --> 45:31.872
You literally stood there
in the airport like a idiot

45:31.905 --> 45:33.240
as he left you?

45:33.274 --> 45:35.143
Yeah.

45:35.175 --> 45:38.211
Do you not see what's,
like, wrong there?

45:38.245 --> 45:40.482
I'm just going to wait.

45:40.514 --> 45:42.417
I mean, two weeks is
not that long, right?

45:42.449 --> 45:46.288
Did he say something
to you?

45:46.321 --> 45:47.656
Text you when he landed
or anything?

45:47.688 --> 45:51.159
No. I think it's, like,
a "break" break.

45:51.192 --> 45:52.427
I don't hear from him

45:52.461 --> 45:54.430
- for two weeks.
- Are you kidding me?

45:54.463 --> 45:56.466
No, Iris.

45:56.499 --> 45:57.834
I just...
I can't do it.

45:57.867 --> 45:59.669
Stop setting yourself up
to get so hurt.

45:59.702 --> 46:00.637
Well, I can't do anything.
He's gone.

46:00.669 --> 46:02.372
I just have to wait
and that's all I can do.

46:02.405 --> 46:03.439
No, you don't.

46:03.473 --> 46:07.310
You went from one big
relationship that you, like,

46:07.344 --> 46:09.513
committed to so hard,
and then...

46:09.545 --> 46:10.681
Yes. I get it, okay?

46:10.714 --> 46:12.216
You don't have to
bring it up every time.

46:12.248 --> 46:13.317
Mom is still
getting over it.

46:13.350 --> 46:15.753
Okay. We...
Yeah. I know that.

46:15.787 --> 46:17.189
This is, like,
Chapter 2.

46:17.222 --> 46:18.957
You can't
just be jumping

46:18.990 --> 46:20.625
from one relationship
to another

46:20.657 --> 46:23.327
and, like,
sleep with two people

46:23.360 --> 46:25.196
your whole entire life.

46:25.229 --> 46:29.267
I think you need to
go through, like,

46:29.301 --> 46:31.304
a phase.

46:33.538 --> 46:35.874
Like,
see other people?

46:35.908 --> 46:38.277
No. I think you need to
ho around for a little bit.

46:38.310 --> 46:39.713
Oh.

46:39.746 --> 46:41.949
There's, like,
a reset button

46:41.981 --> 46:43.583
at the back of
your vagina,

46:43.617 --> 46:46.220
and I think you need to,
like...

46:46.253 --> 46:47.521
No.

46:47.554 --> 46:49.489
I am not going to
go through that.

46:49.521 --> 46:50.623
No.
I don't need that.

46:50.657 --> 46:51.759
Yes. Yes, you do.

46:51.792 --> 46:53.328
Honestly,
when I did it,

46:53.361 --> 46:55.462
- it was just like...
- You went through a phase? Wow.

46:55.495 --> 46:59.968
Yeah. I went through a phase
and I loved my phase.

47:00.000 --> 47:03.672
And then I met Justin,
and now my phase is done.

47:03.704 --> 47:06.308
Like, go have fun.

47:06.340 --> 47:07.643
It's fun.

47:07.675 --> 47:08.844
You don't have to
worry about anything

47:08.876 --> 47:11.846
or hurting anybody's feelings
or having your feelings hurt.

47:11.880 --> 47:15.384
It's just you and
a bunch of cute dudes.

47:15.417 --> 47:18.320
No.

47:18.354 --> 47:20.022
- Yes.
- No!

47:20.055 --> 47:21.590
Yes.
Give me your phone.

47:21.624 --> 47:23.326
- No.
- Give me your phone.

47:23.359 --> 47:24.527
Iris...

47:24.559 --> 47:25.762
- What are you going to do?
- Nothing.

47:25.794 --> 47:27.831
Give me your phone.

47:29.465 --> 47:32.502
- Oh, my God. Can you...
- Stop.

47:32.536 --> 47:34.705
You cannot seriously
be downloading my...

47:34.737 --> 47:35.638
Yes.

47:35.672 --> 47:37.941
Oh, my God. You're
actually going to do it.

47:37.974 --> 47:40.412
You know what? If something
bad happens to me,

47:40.445 --> 47:42.314
- I'm going to blame you.
- Nothing bad is going to happen to you.

47:56.395 --> 47:59.431
I'm trying to become
a podcaster, you know?

47:59.464 --> 48:00.565
And just, like...

48:00.598 --> 48:04.604
Like talking about music?
Or what kind?

48:04.637 --> 48:06.673
Uh, you know,
I'm looking more at, like,

48:06.706 --> 48:09.442
trying to, like,
document the internet.

48:09.476 --> 48:12.412
I mean, the internet is kind
of a broad subject, but...

48:12.445 --> 48:13.713
Right? Smile?

48:13.747 --> 48:15.750
It's, like,
I got a couple of buds

48:15.783 --> 48:18.652
and we're just going to, like,
you know, kind of, like, chat,

48:18.685 --> 48:23.691
and it's going to be, like,
just a nice, cool podcast.

48:23.725 --> 48:24.859
I don't know.

48:24.892 --> 48:26.060
Uh-huh.

48:26.094 --> 48:29.398
So, like, you looking
for anything, like,

48:29.431 --> 48:30.999
casual
or whatever?

48:31.032 --> 48:33.568
What do you mean?

48:33.601 --> 48:35.870
Show me your tits.

48:35.903 --> 48:38.074
Ew.

48:39.843 --> 48:40.977
- Hi.
- Hello.

48:41.009 --> 48:42.078
- Hi.
- Hello.

48:42.111 --> 48:43.646
- Hello.
- I like your face.

48:43.680 --> 48:47.984
Thank you... I guess.

48:48.017 --> 48:49.352
What area of the city
do you live in?

48:49.386 --> 48:51.622
I live somewhere
in The Maples.

48:51.655 --> 48:53.991
Oh, nice.
That's close to me.

48:54.023 --> 48:55.092
Hey, you want to
come over sometime?

48:55.126 --> 48:57.795
Maybe we should
talk first...

48:57.827 --> 48:59.496
Oh, cool. Yeah, yeah.
We can talk.

48:59.530 --> 49:00.465
We can talk.

49:00.498 --> 49:01.898
Yeah. Tell me something
more about yourself.

49:01.931 --> 49:04.635
Oh, you know, uh,
I like to dance.

49:04.669 --> 49:07.373
Hey, do you have
naked pictures?

49:07.406 --> 49:09.408
I notice that you say
you're a hunter.

49:09.441 --> 49:10.776
I was just curious
what that meant.

49:10.809 --> 49:14.513
Uh, it means, like,
I shoot animals.

49:14.546 --> 49:18.418
And then what do you do?
Like...

49:18.451 --> 49:20.420
Usually, I just skin it

49:20.453 --> 49:23.590
and cook it up
and eat it.

49:23.623 --> 49:26.960
So, you, like,
you gut it and...

49:26.993 --> 49:27.928
Yeah.

49:27.961 --> 49:30.465
- So, you see all the blood, and...
- Oh, yeah.

49:33.934 --> 49:36.504
Oh.

49:36.537 --> 49:38.773
Hey.

49:38.805 --> 49:40.741
- Hey.
- What's up?

49:40.775 --> 49:42.778
Not much.

49:42.810 --> 49:44.545
I promise that
I'm not a dog face.

49:44.578 --> 49:46.747
My profile pic
is just my dog.

49:46.781 --> 49:48.516
- Aw.
- I have a human face.

49:48.549 --> 49:49.850
Yes. That is...
Yes.

49:49.884 --> 49:51.821
That's, uh, my dog,
Bailey, though,

49:51.854 --> 49:54.490
- in the pic, yeah.
- Yeah, I figured.

49:54.523 --> 49:56.659
- He's very cute.
- Thank you. Thank you. You like dogs?

49:56.691 --> 49:58.561
- I do. I love dogs.
- Nice.

49:58.593 --> 50:00.829
- He's not at my apartment right now.
- Aw.

50:00.863 --> 50:02.498
Yeah.
He's with my parents.

50:02.530 --> 50:04.000
I like to let him
go out to the country

50:04.033 --> 50:05.102
every couple of weeks

50:05.134 --> 50:06.870
and just, you know, run around.

50:06.902 --> 50:08.839
It's not... I don't
think it's right

50:08.872 --> 50:11.040
for a dog to spend its whole
life in the city, so...

50:11.073 --> 50:12.642
- Yeah.
- ...just give it a break.

50:12.676 --> 50:13.877
Thoughtful of you.

50:13.910 --> 50:15.979
Thank you.

50:33.966 --> 50:36.969
Just a sec.

51:56.654 --> 51:58.557
Okay.

51:58.591 --> 51:59.891
That's never happened
to me before.

51:59.924 --> 52:01.627
No, it's okay. Um...

52:01.660 --> 52:03.664
But, uh, ready to go.

52:03.697 --> 52:05.298
Ready to go.

52:05.331 --> 52:08.634
Yeah. Actually, I was
just going to put my pants on,

52:08.668 --> 52:10.336
and I was going to go.

52:10.369 --> 52:11.572
Sorry.

52:11.604 --> 52:13.206
No, I'm sorry, because it's...

52:13.238 --> 52:15.642
I just feel it's, like, not
fair to you that...

52:15.676 --> 52:16.878
- Oh, no, no, no!
- You know?

52:16.910 --> 52:18.046
It's okay. Like, I...

52:18.078 --> 52:20.347
Because you didn't
finish, either, so...

52:20.381 --> 52:23.350
Yeah. It's a...
It's fine.

52:23.384 --> 52:25.219
You don't believe
that I can do this.

52:25.252 --> 52:26.955
- No, no! I do!
- But I can do this.

52:26.988 --> 52:29.124
I swear to God, I can do this.

52:29.157 --> 52:31.594
If I can do one thing in
life, it's this sex thing.

52:31.626 --> 52:32.695
And...

52:32.728 --> 52:34.597
I... I get that.

52:34.630 --> 52:35.898
I'm okay. Thank you.

52:35.931 --> 52:37.199
Thank you, though. Really.

52:37.231 --> 52:39.234
I proved to myself that
I can do it in there.

52:39.267 --> 52:40.836
I wish you saw it,
because it was amazing.

52:40.870 --> 52:42.739
It was beautiful, and I
want to show it to you now.

52:42.772 --> 52:44.007
- Okay.
- TMI. First date.

52:45.207 --> 52:46.375
Here's the thing.

52:46.408 --> 52:48.845
I really didn't expect

52:48.877 --> 52:51.214
for this to go so far...

52:51.248 --> 52:52.116
- Yeah.
- ...so soon.

52:52.148 --> 52:55.018
Uh, I just really
went on a dating app

52:55.052 --> 52:56.721
because my sister
told me to.

52:56.753 --> 52:58.288
- Okay.
- Uh, I...

52:58.322 --> 52:59.790
Is your sister cool?

52:59.822 --> 53:01.192
She's getting
married.

53:01.224 --> 53:04.095
You see, my boyfriend
left, and I... I thought

53:04.129 --> 53:07.265
that this would really
help me get over it.

53:07.298 --> 53:09.801
Uh, my sister thinks that
there's a reset button

53:09.834 --> 53:10.902
at the back
of my vagina,

53:10.934 --> 53:14.872
but I... I guess
there's not.

53:14.905 --> 53:16.842
So... Yeah.

53:16.875 --> 53:18.243
That's like a metaphor.

53:18.277 --> 53:21.014
I... Yes, I know.

53:21.047 --> 53:22.749
Oh, God.

53:22.781 --> 53:25.017
Just go on another one!
It'll be fine!

53:25.051 --> 53:26.753
I do not want to
go on another one.

53:26.786 --> 53:27.921
I'm just going to
wait for Simon.

53:27.954 --> 53:29.390
Uh, what?

53:29.423 --> 53:30.991
Maybe that's
what Simon meant

53:31.024 --> 53:33.994
when he said to sow the
wild oats, you know?

53:34.026 --> 53:35.061
Because now, I just
know that he's the one

53:35.095 --> 53:37.798
- that I want, so...
- No, that's not what he meant.

53:37.831 --> 53:39.433
Well, I'm not going
to do it again, Agnes.

53:39.466 --> 53:41.869
You did not
sow your wild oats!

53:41.902 --> 53:43.705
You sowed one oat.

53:43.737 --> 53:46.306
You had one, okay?
So, go on another one!

53:46.339 --> 53:47.941
- No!
- Ah, frick, Iris.

53:47.975 --> 53:49.411
- I just don't want to.
- I can't believe

53:49.444 --> 53:51.914
you did not put the keys in
your frickin' pocket!

54:22.979 --> 54:25.248
- You got me.
- Mm-hmm.

54:25.282 --> 54:27.219
- Hello.
- That's good. Hi.

54:27.252 --> 54:28.954
Hi.

54:28.986 --> 54:31.189
Ho, it's easy to forget how
cold this city is!

54:31.223 --> 54:34.159
Did
you miss it?

54:34.191 --> 54:36.227
No, I didn't
miss it, per se.

54:36.261 --> 54:37.896
- Mm.
- Missed you.

54:37.928 --> 54:40.500
Hey, you didn't get any of
my text messages, eh?

54:40.532 --> 54:42.768
No. Just... I just got
them all right now.

54:42.802 --> 54:44.971
- Ho, that's bad.
- I know.

54:45.003 --> 54:46.172
- But...
- You got mine?

54:46.204 --> 54:49.742
Yeah, all at once. I thought
my phone was going to blow up.

54:49.775 --> 54:51.010
Sorry.

54:51.044 --> 54:52.946
Yeah. No.
I'm sorry, too.

54:52.979 --> 54:56.117
Um, actually,
I'm...

54:56.149 --> 54:58.818
I'm really sorry, because
that trip kind of was

54:58.852 --> 54:59.819
what I thought
it was going to be,

54:59.852 --> 55:03.023
and... and I had a lot
of time to think, but...

55:03.056 --> 55:04.192
I had a lot
of time to think,

55:04.224 --> 55:05.860
and, uh, one of
the things I realized...

55:05.893 --> 55:09.263
- It's right here.
- ...was, uh...

55:09.297 --> 55:10.499
that maybe it seemed
like a good idea,

55:10.532 --> 55:12.534
but it was
a selfish idea.

55:12.567 --> 55:15.504
And... I'm embarrassed

55:15.537 --> 55:17.472
that I even
went through with it,

55:17.506 --> 55:19.108
and I'm sorry
about that.

55:19.140 --> 55:21.443
It's okay.

55:21.477 --> 55:22.545
You're here now.

55:22.577 --> 55:25.213
Thank you for
being cool.

55:25.247 --> 55:27.784
Get in, then.

55:27.817 --> 55:30.920
But the other thing that
I realized was, um...

55:30.953 --> 55:33.122
Or... Sorry.

55:33.156 --> 55:34.891
Hi.

55:34.924 --> 55:36.058
Hi.

55:36.092 --> 55:37.828
Uh...

55:39.930 --> 55:43.534
Uh, before you
take off...

55:43.568 --> 55:45.203
When I was down there
and, uh,

55:45.235 --> 55:48.972
I had all that
space that you were...

55:49.006 --> 55:50.441
- Yeah.
- ...good enough to give me.

55:50.474 --> 55:52.011
You probably sowed
your wild oats

55:52.044 --> 55:53.444
and slept with a
whole bunch of women,

55:53.477 --> 55:56.147
so now, we got
to talk about it.

55:56.181 --> 56:00.019
What? No.

56:00.051 --> 56:02.086
No. That's not at all what
I meant when I said that.

56:02.120 --> 56:03.889
Is that what you
thought I was doing?

56:03.923 --> 56:05.825
Yeah.

56:05.858 --> 56:07.293
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

56:07.327 --> 56:09.229
No, no, no. I didn't
mean that at all.

56:09.262 --> 56:10.964
I meant to...

56:10.996 --> 56:12.298
Geez. Yeah. No.

56:12.331 --> 56:14.066
I was, like, alone
the whole time

56:14.099 --> 56:17.305
and I was... I was
thinking about you.

56:17.337 --> 56:21.107
And I was thinking about all
the stuff that I...

56:21.140 --> 56:22.876
...that I already
knew before I left.

56:22.910 --> 56:26.214
And that's that...
you know...

56:26.247 --> 56:28.250
uh...

56:29.251 --> 56:33.222
I love you and...

56:33.255 --> 56:35.858
I want to move
in together.

56:35.891 --> 56:39.495
And... that's it.

56:40.528 --> 56:42.898
I had a... a whole thing that
I was going to say,

56:42.932 --> 56:44.901
and now, I can't
remember it at all.

56:48.037 --> 56:50.040
Right.

56:54.076 --> 56:57.080
And... and take your time,
but just know that I...

56:57.114 --> 56:59.916
can't breathe
right now, so...

56:59.949 --> 57:01.985
Right.

57:03.655 --> 57:05.156
Yeah!

57:05.189 --> 57:07.259
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

57:07.292 --> 57:09.094
That doesn't seem
crazy to you? That's...

57:09.126 --> 57:10.394
No! No.

57:10.428 --> 57:11.930
Yeah. Yeah, it is, but...

57:13.664 --> 57:17.636
But no. Yeah. I would
love to move in with you.

57:17.670 --> 57:19.906
Okay.

57:22.473 --> 57:26.211
God, you took two weeks
to figure that out?

57:26.244 --> 57:27.381
Geez.

57:27.414 --> 57:29.416
Moving in together?

57:29.448 --> 57:32.552
Yeah. I've decided to
move in with Simon.

57:32.584 --> 57:35.188
What?

57:35.220 --> 57:37.323
Do... do you
know this guy?

57:38.657 --> 57:40.260
Ma, it's been a while.
We've been dating a while.

57:40.294 --> 57:41.429
"It's been a while." You
would say that?

57:41.462 --> 57:43.197
A while, Iris?

57:43.230 --> 57:46.100
Arthur! Arthur...

57:46.132 --> 57:50.471
Talk to your daughter.

57:50.504 --> 57:54.008
We're so busy with the social,
and here goes your daughter

57:54.041 --> 57:58.079
saying she's moving with
Simon. I don't even know...

57:58.112 --> 57:59.380
Do you know Simon?

57:59.414 --> 58:00.983
Who's Simon? No.

58:03.252 --> 58:04.487
Ma.

58:04.520 --> 58:07.257
What will they say?
What will our friends say?

58:07.290 --> 58:09.058
We're Catholic.

58:13.162 --> 58:14.062
I am 23, and...

58:14.096 --> 58:15.733
Twenty-three!

58:15.766 --> 58:19.103
...before, when you
got married with this Bong,

58:19.135 --> 58:20.971
and then you got
this divorce.

58:21.005 --> 58:24.240
Oh, my God!

58:24.273 --> 58:25.275
...relatives and friends.

58:25.309 --> 58:27.179
- But Ma, I was 19.
- What do you say about this?

58:27.211 --> 58:28.346
I didn't know what I was...

58:31.716 --> 58:34.353
This is not
the right time.

58:34.386 --> 58:38.490
Okay? This is going too far.

58:38.522 --> 58:40.525
Nope, nope, nope.

58:41.626 --> 58:44.063
I forbid you
for doing this.

58:44.096 --> 58:45.264
Nope.

58:45.297 --> 58:47.099
...moving, moving. Nothing.

58:51.805 --> 58:53.707
She's going to do
it anyway, Mom.

58:53.740 --> 58:57.176
I know!

58:57.209 --> 58:59.112
You're being quiet.

58:59.146 --> 59:02.716
I have seen your heart.

59:02.750 --> 59:05.420
I know. That's it.

59:05.453 --> 59:06.721
You've decided.

59:06.753 --> 59:08.089
Do you think you're
doing it right?

59:08.121 --> 59:10.591
If you think you're
doing it right,

59:10.625 --> 59:12.494
I'm out of this.
We're done.

59:22.437 --> 59:23.506
Got it?

59:23.539 --> 59:26.777
Yep.

59:26.810 --> 59:29.545
Uh, let's just
bring everything in here,

59:29.578 --> 59:33.616
and then we'll do
it in here.

59:36.486 --> 59:38.654
Okay.

59:38.687 --> 59:40.090
That is one trip, one trip.

59:40.124 --> 59:41.459
- No problem.
- Okay.

59:41.492 --> 59:42.760
Did you talk to your
parents about all this?

59:42.793 --> 59:44.796
- Oh. Yeah.
- Yeah?

59:44.829 --> 59:47.198
- Yeah.
- And they're cool with it, or...

59:47.231 --> 59:49.566
Um...

59:49.599 --> 59:50.803
What is this thing?

59:50.835 --> 59:55.073
What do you mean? It's
an ironing board.

1:00:00.511 --> 1:00:02.781
Your shirt's inside out.

1:00:02.815 --> 1:00:04.316
- Yes, it is.
- Okay.

1:00:04.349 --> 1:00:06.286
I get to wear
it twice like this.

1:00:06.318 --> 1:00:09.355
Okay. Hold
on. Hold on.

1:00:13.191 --> 1:00:16.796
Oh, God. Uh, do
you always

1:00:16.830 --> 1:00:19.100
wear your shoes
inside the house?

1:00:19.133 --> 1:00:21.335
Uh, not all
the time.

1:00:21.368 --> 1:00:22.470
I take them
off to shower.

1:00:22.502 --> 1:00:25.638
Good. Uh...

1:00:25.671 --> 1:00:28.676
- Do you want me to take them off?
- Yes, please,

1:00:28.710 --> 1:00:31.646
because it's going
to be a thing.

1:00:31.679 --> 1:00:33.648
- I don't want to start a thing.
- Thank you.

1:00:33.681 --> 1:00:36.485
But how do
you... know?

1:00:36.518 --> 1:00:39.655
Please. Watch.

1:00:39.687 --> 1:00:41.557
Clean.

1:00:43.225 --> 1:00:45.495
Also clean.

1:00:45.528 --> 1:00:47.530
Okay.

1:00:48.763 --> 1:00:50.566
What are you
doing in there?

1:00:50.598 --> 1:00:53.237
Laundry basket?

1:00:56.438 --> 1:00:58.442
- What's that for?
- It'll just live there,

1:00:58.474 --> 1:01:03.213
and you don't have to
ask about it ever again.

1:01:03.247 --> 1:01:04.682
Banana sauce?

1:01:04.715 --> 1:01:06.283
It's ketchup.

1:01:06.316 --> 1:01:08.352
No, it's
banana sauce.

1:01:08.385 --> 1:01:09.720
What? Do you
put this on bananas,

1:01:09.753 --> 1:01:11.388
or is it made with bananas?

1:01:11.421 --> 1:01:12.856
It's ketchup.

1:01:12.890 --> 1:01:15.528
It's got
bananas in it.

1:01:15.560 --> 1:01:16.428
Oh.

1:01:16.462 --> 1:01:18.664
Uh, we're going to
have to go shopping.

1:01:18.696 --> 1:01:19.664
- What?
- Yeah.

1:01:19.697 --> 1:01:20.732
I have
so much food.

1:01:20.766 --> 1:01:23.435
No! There's not enough.
What if people come over?

1:01:23.467 --> 1:01:25.504
Well, what if people come over
and they don't want to eat?

1:01:25.536 --> 1:01:26.773
Well, they're going
to eat anyway,

1:01:26.805 --> 1:01:27.807
because you
serve them food.

1:01:27.840 --> 1:01:30.910
Where did
the sauce go?

1:01:30.943 --> 1:01:32.478
Up there.

1:01:32.512 --> 1:01:34.481
I think that
clears this box.

1:01:34.514 --> 1:01:35.881
Wow. We did it.

1:01:35.914 --> 1:01:37.249
Awesome.

1:01:37.282 --> 1:01:38.485
Superstar.

1:01:38.517 --> 1:01:41.721
Okay. So...

1:01:41.754 --> 1:01:45.692
I would love for you to
meet my family on Saturday.

1:01:46.627 --> 1:01:48.895
It's Agnes's
social. It's...

1:01:48.928 --> 1:01:50.029
- Right.
- It's this Saturday,

1:01:50.064 --> 1:01:54.702
and I think it would be great
if you would could come.

1:01:55.704 --> 1:01:57.372
- I would love to.
- Yeah?

1:01:57.405 --> 1:01:58.874
Yeah.

1:01:58.907 --> 1:02:00.609
Okay.

1:02:02.611 --> 1:02:05.647
Oh, my God.

1:02:05.680 --> 1:02:09.451
I think
that's it.

1:02:09.484 --> 1:02:10.819
- Yay.
- We're done.

1:02:10.852 --> 1:02:12.855
Yes.

1:02:14.256 --> 1:02:17.227
Now what?

1:02:21.898 --> 1:02:24.936
Play that bass.

1:02:26.003 --> 1:02:27.472
No.

1:02:27.504 --> 1:02:29.874
Aw. You know you can't
escape me anymore.

1:02:29.906 --> 1:02:31.408
No, no,
no, no, no.

1:02:31.441 --> 1:02:32.776
You are not yet ready,

1:02:32.810 --> 1:02:34.379
and by "you," I mean
me and the bass.

1:02:34.412 --> 1:02:38.450
I live
here now, so...

1:02:39.585 --> 1:02:40.720
Some other time.

1:02:40.753 --> 1:02:42.588
- Boo!
- I have something better,

1:02:42.621 --> 1:02:45.958
actually, if
you'll follow me.

1:02:45.991 --> 1:02:47.893
- Just over here.
- Okay.

1:02:47.925 --> 1:02:49.362
Roomie.

1:03:01.541 --> 1:03:02.844
What is that
supposed to be?

1:03:02.877 --> 1:03:04.411
That is, uh,
supposed to be

1:03:04.444 --> 1:03:05.879
your face
on a cake...

1:03:05.913 --> 1:03:07.282
- Oh, no.
- ...which I know

1:03:07.315 --> 1:03:09.284
you've always
wanted.

1:03:09.317 --> 1:03:10.851
It was... I
did a sketch,

1:03:10.884 --> 1:03:12.953
and then I thought I could put
the sketch on a cake.

1:03:12.987 --> 1:03:14.823
And so I got someone
else to do it, and it...

1:03:14.856 --> 1:03:16.659
- Ah. Sure.
- ...uh, it turned into that...

1:03:16.691 --> 1:03:18.293
- Blame it on the artist.
- ...which is, in my defence,

1:03:18.327 --> 1:03:20.629
not actually what I drew.

1:03:20.662 --> 1:03:22.665
But, uh, it still
might be fun to eat.

1:03:22.698 --> 1:03:23.832
It's so awful!

1:03:25.367 --> 1:03:26.401
Yeah, it's
a little scary,

1:03:26.434 --> 1:03:29.506
but that's why we got
to get rid of the evidence.

1:03:29.538 --> 1:03:30.806
But it... You know,
it only lasts

1:03:30.839 --> 1:03:32.708
as long as it takes
us to eat this, so...

1:03:34.109 --> 1:03:36.912
Eat.

1:03:37.913 --> 1:03:42.652
- You alright?
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

1:03:45.755 --> 1:03:48.591
Hey, whoa.

1:03:50.794 --> 1:03:52.797
Hey.

1:03:52.830 --> 1:03:54.966
I can't do this. I
can't do this to you.

1:03:54.998 --> 1:03:59.038
I can't do
this to you.

1:04:02.574 --> 1:04:05.477
I'm so sorry.

1:04:06.445 --> 1:04:08.514
I'm so sorry.

1:04:08.547 --> 1:04:10.449
For what?
You're freaking me out.

1:04:10.483 --> 1:04:14.019
No, no.

1:04:14.052 --> 1:04:16.622
- Are you okay?
- No.

1:04:22.796 --> 1:04:26.701
I slept with
someone else...

1:04:26.733 --> 1:04:29.337
while you were gone.

1:04:31.072 --> 1:04:35.110
I'm so sorry.

1:04:38.981 --> 1:04:41.684
I'm so sorry.

1:04:41.716 --> 1:04:45.488
I just wanted
you here, but...

1:04:45.521 --> 1:04:49.559
but I thought I'd
lost you, so...

1:04:58.500 --> 1:05:02.539
No, please
say something.

1:05:05.642 --> 1:05:08.111
You wait until now
to tell me?

1:05:08.144 --> 1:05:09.179
I...

1:05:09.213 --> 1:05:11.015
Well, you got home,

1:05:11.048 --> 1:05:14.920
and then you... you
told me you loved me.

1:05:14.953 --> 1:05:19.458
And it's all I ever
wanted, and I...

1:05:20.225 --> 1:05:22.493
I couldn't...

1:05:22.527 --> 1:05:25.698
Right.

1:05:27.867 --> 1:05:29.836
When were you
going to tell me?

1:05:29.869 --> 1:05:31.470
Because you've
already moved in,

1:05:31.503 --> 1:05:34.641
so that's...
fucking great.

1:05:34.673 --> 1:05:35.842
- That's good.
- I... They were going to...

1:05:35.874 --> 1:05:37.643
So, just the moment
I left, you just thought

1:05:37.677 --> 1:05:39.779
that that would be prime
opportunity to do that, or what?

1:05:39.812 --> 1:05:43.483
No, no! You told me to
sow my wild oats,

1:05:43.517 --> 1:05:45.652
- and so I did. It's...
- That's not what that means!

1:05:45.685 --> 1:05:47.821
Of course it is!
How could you not know?

1:05:47.855 --> 1:05:50.157
How is that what that means
in... in that context?

1:05:50.189 --> 1:05:52.059
It means "take what you have
and go out in the world,"

1:05:52.092 --> 1:05:54.128
not "just fuck a bunch
of guys the second I'm gone!"

1:05:54.161 --> 1:05:56.730
It was just...

1:05:56.764 --> 1:05:57.966
I didn't know,
okay? I'm sorry.

1:05:57.998 --> 1:05:59.467
Yeah, you didn't
know. You just heard

1:05:59.501 --> 1:06:00.902
whatever you needed to
hear in that moment,

1:06:00.934 --> 1:06:02.203
which is...

1:06:02.237 --> 1:06:04.106
But you
left, Simon.

1:06:04.138 --> 1:06:06.107
You asked
for a break.

1:06:06.140 --> 1:06:07.976
- No! I... That's not what I said.
- You asked for a break!

1:06:08.009 --> 1:06:09.578
- And you know...
- That's not what I said at all!

1:06:09.611 --> 1:06:11.146
Yes, it was, and
you know what?

1:06:11.180 --> 1:06:13.982
That's what people say when they
never want to come back, okay?

1:06:14.015 --> 1:06:16.552
That's what fucking Bong said,
so of course I was going

1:06:16.585 --> 1:06:17.954
to think I was never
going to have you back!

1:06:17.987 --> 1:06:20.991
What are you talking about?
Well, that's not me!

1:06:21.023 --> 1:06:24.929
It's just you. It's just you
on your own with that decision!

1:06:28.899 --> 1:06:30.968
Oh, you destroyed this.

1:06:31.001 --> 1:06:35.005
No. I didn't mean to.

1:06:40.078 --> 1:06:42.915
I didn't know, okay?

1:06:42.947 --> 1:06:44.849
What are you doing?

1:06:44.882 --> 1:06:46.886
Where are you going?

1:06:46.918 --> 1:06:49.922
Simon, wait.

1:07:14.214 --> 1:07:16.751
I... I...

1:07:16.784 --> 1:07:20.555
I would do
anything, anything,

1:07:20.588 --> 1:07:22.224
just to take back
everything that I did

1:07:22.256 --> 1:07:26.295
and make this
all okay.

1:07:28.598 --> 1:07:32.636
So can you come back and
work this out, please?

1:07:39.675 --> 1:07:41.679
Simon?

1:07:51.723 --> 1:07:53.725
Simon?

1:09:39.238 --> 1:09:41.274
Yo, Simon. I was just
shaving. What's up?

1:09:41.308 --> 1:09:44.411
Hey. Uh, it's actually Iris.

1:09:44.443 --> 1:09:46.145
- Who?
- Hey.

1:09:46.179 --> 1:09:48.047
Why are you... Hold up. What are
you doing with Simon's phone?

1:09:48.081 --> 1:09:49.717
- Who is this?
- It's Iris.

1:09:49.750 --> 1:09:52.220
Uh, Simon's girlfriend?

1:09:52.252 --> 1:09:53.887
Oh, okay.

1:09:53.921 --> 1:09:55.390
Why you got
Simon's phone?

1:09:55.422 --> 1:09:56.490
Where's Simon?

1:09:56.524 --> 1:09:59.260
Uh, yeah. I was actually
going to ask you

1:09:59.292 --> 1:10:01.429
if you knew where he was.

1:10:01.462 --> 1:10:02.965
Uh, no, no.

1:10:02.998 --> 1:10:06.368
He hasn't... he hasn't
texted me. Why?

1:10:06.400 --> 1:10:09.270
Mm. Okay.

1:10:09.303 --> 1:10:12.874
I just wanted to ask,
because he... uh... he...

1:10:12.908 --> 1:10:14.878
left, so...

1:10:14.910 --> 1:10:17.114
Uh, what do you
want from me?

1:10:17.147 --> 1:10:18.782
He's not with
you, huh?

1:10:18.815 --> 1:10:19.982
No, he's not.

1:10:20.016 --> 1:10:21.151
Is that all you
need? Are we done?

1:10:21.183 --> 1:10:24.887
Actually, uh, do you know
where his parents live at all?

1:10:24.920 --> 1:10:27.457
Like, their
address or...

1:10:27.491 --> 1:10:29.060
No. I don't know. They
live in one of those

1:10:29.093 --> 1:10:30.795
fucking Mennonite... Uh,
Morden. Morden.

1:10:30.827 --> 1:10:32.330
That's the name of
the town, right?

1:10:32.362 --> 1:10:34.464
No. What... Why are you asking
me where his parents live?

1:10:34.497 --> 1:10:35.799
Why? That's none of your
fucking business.

1:10:35.832 --> 1:10:37.401
- But it's...
- Stop freaking out about all...

1:10:37.433 --> 1:10:39.437
Simon just leaves
sometimes, alright?

1:10:39.470 --> 1:10:41.005
He just leaves.
Just leave it alone.

1:10:41.038 --> 1:10:43.175
Do you know exactly where in
Morden he lives, or...

1:10:43.207 --> 1:10:45.510
No, I don't know where
in Morden his parents live.

1:10:45.543 --> 1:10:48.147
I don't think you should be
asking those questions.

1:10:48.180 --> 1:10:50.784
Ugh. Whatever.

1:10:53.285 --> 1:10:56.288
Hey. Uh...

1:10:57.489 --> 1:10:59.425
How are you? I haven't
seen you in so long.

1:10:59.458 --> 1:11:02.296
Hi! Nice to see you!
How've you been?

1:11:02.329 --> 1:11:03.464
Good. Are you guys
just helping out

1:11:03.496 --> 1:11:05.499
with the stuff for
the social?

1:11:05.531 --> 1:11:07.834
Hi, Iris.

1:11:07.868 --> 1:11:10.905
Those look nice.

1:11:14.474 --> 1:11:15.576
Can I have
two of those?

1:11:15.610 --> 1:11:17.179
Mila, do you have enough?

1:11:17.211 --> 1:11:18.213
Yeah. I do.

1:11:18.245 --> 1:11:19.480
Hi, Pa.

1:11:19.513 --> 1:11:21.916
Iris...

1:11:21.950 --> 1:11:24.553
I was wondering if
I could borrow the car.

1:11:24.585 --> 1:11:25.419
- Car?
- Yeah. I'm...

1:11:25.454 --> 1:11:27.422
- Where are you doing?
- I'm going to Morden,

1:11:27.456 --> 1:11:30.560
just to meet Simon's family,
and he's already there,

1:11:30.593 --> 1:11:34.430
so I just need
to... get there.

1:11:34.462 --> 1:11:37.433
Okay. Uh, before
I give you the keys,

1:11:37.465 --> 1:11:39.402
come closer.

1:11:39.435 --> 1:11:41.505
- Okay.
- Now...

1:11:41.538 --> 1:11:44.274
let's forget about this for now.

1:11:44.306 --> 1:11:46.976
You know what?

1:11:47.010 --> 1:11:48.345
I just want you
to know,

1:11:48.377 --> 1:11:51.582
your mom really loves
you, okay?

1:11:51.615 --> 1:11:55.352
She only wants you to
be happy, okay?

1:11:55.386 --> 1:11:56.888
- Okay.
- Yeah?

1:11:56.921 --> 1:11:59.990
If Simon will be the
right guy for you

1:12:00.024 --> 1:12:01.124
and you will
be happy...

1:12:01.158 --> 1:12:03.195
Yes, Pa. Of course.

1:12:03.227 --> 1:12:07.498
...Hundred percent...

1:12:07.531 --> 1:12:10.468
Yeah? I'm going to
support you 100 percent.

1:12:10.501 --> 1:12:12.404
- Okay.
- Hundred and one now. Okay?

1:12:12.437 --> 1:12:13.906
Okay.

1:12:13.938 --> 1:12:17.143
That's one percent more.

1:12:17.175 --> 1:12:18.210
But be sure.

1:12:18.243 --> 1:12:19.278
Mm-hmm.

1:12:19.312 --> 1:12:23.316
Okay?

1:12:23.349 --> 1:12:26.587
Don't put your family
through this...

1:12:26.619 --> 1:12:29.390
- Yes, Pa.
- ...unless this is the right guy.

1:12:29.422 --> 1:12:30.523
Okay?

1:12:30.556 --> 1:12:32.158
Yes, Pa.

1:12:32.192 --> 1:12:33.159
Remember that.

1:13:31.724 --> 1:13:32.859
He might have
a library card,

1:13:32.891 --> 1:13:36.996
but we are not allowed to give
out our patron information

1:13:37.029 --> 1:13:38.398
because of the
Privacy Act.

1:13:38.431 --> 1:13:40.133
Right.

1:13:40.165 --> 1:13:43.003
Perhaps a...
phone book, maybe? Uh...

1:13:43.035 --> 1:13:43.869
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1:13:43.904 --> 1:13:45.238
Yeah, we have a phone
book. For sure.

1:13:45.271 --> 1:13:47.074
Okay!

1:13:47.106 --> 1:13:48.641
Oh, wow.

1:13:48.674 --> 1:13:50.143
That's a lot of Friesens.

1:13:50.177 --> 1:13:54.214
There are a
few Friesens.

1:14:02.424 --> 1:14:05.094
Excuse me!

1:14:05.126 --> 1:14:08.162
Sorry. Uh, are you
from here?

1:14:08.196 --> 1:14:10.399
No. I'm actually
from Winnipeg. Sorry.

1:14:10.432 --> 1:14:13.769
Okay. Yeah. You didn't look
familiar. Are you, um...

1:14:13.801 --> 1:14:15.104
- Yes.
- ...Filipino? Okay.

1:14:15.137 --> 1:14:16.072
Filipino.

1:14:16.104 --> 1:14:17.172
Um, you look lost.

1:14:17.206 --> 1:14:19.175
Are you okay?
Do you need help?

1:14:19.207 --> 1:14:21.677
Actually, I'm looking for
my boyfriend, Simon Friesen.

1:14:21.711 --> 1:14:23.680
Uh, do you know him?

1:14:23.712 --> 1:14:25.547
Everybody's Friesen here.

1:14:25.581 --> 1:14:26.550
Yeah.

1:14:26.583 --> 1:14:28.252
I don't know
if I know him,

1:14:28.284 --> 1:14:29.787
but my daughter might
know him.

1:14:29.819 --> 1:14:30.787
She knows everybody...

1:14:30.820 --> 1:14:32.189
- Okay.
- ...I think.

1:14:32.221 --> 1:14:34.124
Uh, I just live
around the corner.

1:14:34.158 --> 1:14:36.193
Are you hungry?
You must be hungry.

1:14:36.226 --> 1:14:38.030
Oh, no. I'm fine.
I actually, uh,

1:14:38.062 --> 1:14:39.563
just grabbed
something to eat.

1:14:39.597 --> 1:14:42.334
Oh, no. I'll give
you a snack. Ramon!

1:14:42.366 --> 1:14:45.302
- Hey.
- I want you to meet somebody.

1:14:45.335 --> 1:14:46.236
- Hi.
- And here.

1:14:46.271 --> 1:14:48.607
- I brought you a surprise.
- Ooh! Thank you.

1:14:48.639 --> 1:14:50.442
- This is Iris.
- Hi. Hi.

1:14:50.476 --> 1:14:51.811
You can call me Ram.
How are you doing?

1:14:51.844 --> 1:14:53.413
- Good.
- Good. You hungry?

1:14:53.446 --> 1:14:54.714
- No. I'm okay, actually.
- Oh, come on.

1:14:54.746 --> 1:14:56.415
- No, no, no, no, no.
- We'll give you a little bit.

1:14:56.448 --> 1:14:57.616
Come on.
Just a little snack.

1:14:57.650 --> 1:15:00.286
Jane, um, I found Iris
wandering around town.

1:15:00.318 --> 1:15:01.787
She came all the way
from Winnipeg...

1:15:01.821 --> 1:15:03.123
- Yeah.
- ...looking for somebody.

1:15:03.156 --> 1:15:05.091
I told her that you
might know him.

1:15:05.125 --> 1:15:08.127
- What's his name again?
- Uh, Simon. Simon Friesen.

1:15:08.161 --> 1:15:10.264
- Mm-hmm.
- Simon Friesen.

1:15:10.296 --> 1:15:12.598
Yeah. He lived
over there... a long time ago.

1:15:12.631 --> 1:15:14.301
By the store?

1:15:14.334 --> 1:15:16.270
No.

1:15:16.304 --> 1:15:18.472
If we get in the car,
can you take us there?

1:15:18.506 --> 1:15:20.708
Yeah.
I'd recognize it.

1:15:20.740 --> 1:15:21.708
Okay.

1:15:21.742 --> 1:15:22.709
That would be great.

1:15:22.743 --> 1:15:23.911
Okay. Well, if you're going
to drive there,

1:15:23.944 --> 1:15:27.482
you should know that nobody's
been there for a long time.

1:15:27.516 --> 1:15:30.520
Uh... what do
you mean? Like...

1:16:26.312 --> 1:16:28.315
Hey!

1:16:31.250 --> 1:16:34.521
Do you... Excuse me!

1:16:34.554 --> 1:16:36.723
You... Do you live here?

1:16:36.757 --> 1:16:38.360
I live over there.

1:16:38.393 --> 1:16:39.528
What's your name?

1:16:39.561 --> 1:16:41.362
Allison.

1:16:41.396 --> 1:16:45.634
I'm Iris.
What are you doing here?

1:16:45.666 --> 1:16:47.902
Vaping.

1:16:47.936 --> 1:16:51.373
I'm here to look
for Simon, Simon Friesen.

1:16:51.407 --> 1:16:52.608
- Yeah?
- You wouldn't happen to know him,

1:16:52.640 --> 1:16:54.809
- would you?
- I know him.

1:16:54.842 --> 1:16:55.810
- You do?
- Yeah.

1:16:55.844 --> 1:16:59.515
Uh, do you know if anybody
still lives there?

1:16:59.547 --> 1:17:01.250
Do you know
if he's...

1:17:01.282 --> 1:17:03.753
Simon and
his dad did.

1:17:03.787 --> 1:17:07.891
Okay! Do you know if his
dad is still in there?

1:17:07.923 --> 1:17:09.959
He died three
years ago.

1:17:09.993 --> 1:17:11.929
Oh.

1:17:13.395 --> 1:17:15.499
Okay.

1:17:15.533 --> 1:17:17.502
He was a mess.

1:17:17.534 --> 1:17:20.337
He was always yelling,
angry at Simon.

1:17:20.370 --> 1:17:22.406
My parents wouldn't
even let me go over...

1:17:22.440 --> 1:17:25.643
Um, this is Simon
Friesen, right?

1:17:25.676 --> 1:17:27.980
- Yeah, Simon Friesen.
- Like, blue eyes, dark hair?

1:17:28.013 --> 1:17:29.848
- That's... that's him?
- Yeah.

1:17:29.880 --> 1:17:31.849
How did his dad die?

1:17:31.883 --> 1:17:34.320
He died from drugs
and alcohol.

1:17:34.352 --> 1:17:37.589
Simon stuck around to
take care of him, but...

1:17:37.623 --> 1:17:40.227
And then he left?

1:17:40.259 --> 1:17:41.927
And he just took
a bus to Winnipeg,

1:17:41.960 --> 1:17:46.199
and nobody's
seen him since.

1:17:48.867 --> 1:17:50.871
What about his mom? What
happened to his mom?

1:17:50.903 --> 1:17:55.809
His mom left him when he
was, like... three.

1:17:55.842 --> 1:17:58.912
Moved to BC,
I think.

1:17:58.945 --> 1:18:01.984
That's what
they say.

1:18:10.592 --> 1:18:12.394
- Hi.
- Oh! hi!

1:18:12.427 --> 1:18:13.328
Hi.

1:18:13.360 --> 1:18:14.563
How are you?

1:18:14.597 --> 1:18:16.266
- Um, I'm good.
- Yeah?

1:18:16.298 --> 1:18:17.466
- How about you?
- Good.

1:18:17.499 --> 1:18:18.533
Are you leaving?

1:18:18.566 --> 1:18:20.770
Yeah. Mom,
Iris is home!

1:18:20.803 --> 1:18:22.806
Hi, Ma.

1:18:24.807 --> 1:18:26.310
Do you need
anything?

1:18:26.343 --> 1:18:28.445
No, no, no. Um,
can you just help Dad?

1:18:28.478 --> 1:18:30.581
Oh, my God. He just can't
figure it out with the lights.

1:18:30.613 --> 1:18:32.683
- Okay. I can do that. Yeah.
- Okay. Okay.

1:18:32.715 --> 1:18:33.983
Just let me know if you
need anything else.

1:18:34.017 --> 1:18:35.753
Are you sure you don't
want me to come with you?

1:18:35.786 --> 1:18:37.054
No, no, no! It's okay!

1:18:37.086 --> 1:18:38.555
You don't have to!

1:18:38.589 --> 1:18:39.422
- Okay.
- Thank you!

1:18:39.456 --> 1:18:42.393
Okay. You tell me if
you need anything.

1:18:42.426 --> 1:18:43.827
- Yeah. Okay. I will.
- Okay. Okay.

1:18:43.861 --> 1:18:46.930
- I'll see you later.
- Bye!

1:18:46.964 --> 1:18:50.970
- Hi, Tita.
- Oh, hi!

1:18:52.037 --> 1:18:53.706
Oh, Tita Baby and Tita
Edna, they're here.

1:18:53.739 --> 1:18:54.907
They're making shanghai.

1:18:54.940 --> 1:18:56.075
Oh, okay.

1:18:56.108 --> 1:18:57.443
Are you okay?

1:18:57.475 --> 1:18:58.610
Yeah!

1:18:58.644 --> 1:18:59.945
Hi, sweetie.

1:18:59.977 --> 1:19:01.079
How are you?

1:19:01.113 --> 1:19:02.082
- I'm good.
- Yeah?

1:19:02.115 --> 1:19:04.351
Yes. Oh. Hi, Tita.

1:19:04.383 --> 1:19:05.886
Iris.

1:19:05.918 --> 1:19:06.952
Do you need
help with any lights?

1:19:06.985 --> 1:19:08.854
Oh, it's okay. Um...

1:19:10.923 --> 1:19:13.695
- Yeah. No. I forgot. Sorry.
- Aw.

1:19:13.727 --> 1:19:15.495
Here. I'll give you
the key, anyway.

1:19:15.528 --> 1:19:17.397
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

1:19:17.431 --> 1:19:18.799
The aunts are
being so weird.

1:19:18.833 --> 1:19:20.867
Like, they're being
so nice to me.

1:19:20.901 --> 1:19:22.870
Why is that?

1:19:22.902 --> 1:19:25.339
I'll tell you
honestly.

1:19:30.379 --> 1:19:31.580
Simon left you.

1:19:31.612 --> 1:19:32.947
How did you guys...

1:19:32.980 --> 1:19:36.018
A friend of
your Tita Flor, okay,

1:19:36.050 --> 1:19:38.621
knows the family
in Morden.

1:19:38.653 --> 1:19:42.991
Tita Flor told
us about it.

1:19:43.024 --> 1:19:45.060
Why don't you see your
mom and apologize?

1:19:45.094 --> 1:19:46.829
No, Pa!

1:19:46.863 --> 1:19:50.668
I don't need to apologize to you
guys for the things that I do!

1:19:50.700 --> 1:19:52.470
I'm so tired of
you guys telling me

1:19:52.503 --> 1:19:53.671
that I'm always the
one that's fucking up!

1:19:53.704 --> 1:19:55.139
- No, it's not!
- Pa!

1:19:55.172 --> 1:19:57.742
Please! Why don't you
see your mom...

1:19:57.775 --> 1:19:59.443
- No!
- ...and apologize?

1:19:59.476 --> 1:20:00.745
- No!
- Why not?

1:20:00.778 --> 1:20:02.914
You want me to
apologize to Mom

1:20:02.946 --> 1:20:05.116
because I
fucked up again?

1:20:05.150 --> 1:20:07.619
You want me to give
that to her, Dad?

1:20:07.651 --> 1:20:09.587
I don't want
to argue with you.

1:20:09.620 --> 1:20:12.590
Just see your mom
and apologize, right now.

1:20:12.624 --> 1:20:16.662
Fine! You want me
to apologize to Mom?

1:20:19.497 --> 1:20:21.000
I don't owe
you anything!

1:20:21.032 --> 1:20:23.402
I don't need to apologize
to you for anything...

1:20:23.436 --> 1:20:24.504
- Do you think...
- ...that's happening

1:20:24.536 --> 1:20:25.739
- in my personal life!
- ...you know what you're saying?

1:20:25.773 --> 1:20:27.808
I know exactly what I'm saying.

1:20:27.840 --> 1:20:29.776
I am saying that I am
done with this bullshit

1:20:29.809 --> 1:20:31.444
- between you and me.
- Now, you're telling me...

1:20:31.478 --> 1:20:33.113
Okay. You don't get to tell me
what to do anymore, Mom!

1:20:33.145 --> 1:20:34.514
- No.
- Listen!

1:20:38.685 --> 1:20:41.922
In our family,
you put so much shame on us!

1:20:41.956 --> 1:20:45.193
And that's what you make me feel
every fucking day of my life!

1:20:45.225 --> 1:20:46.193
So, what happened
to Bong?

1:20:46.226 --> 1:20:47.394
It doesn't matter
what happened to Bong, Ma!

1:20:47.427 --> 1:20:49.698
- And then there's another guy?
- That is past! How can you...

1:20:49.731 --> 1:20:51.033
And then you didn't
even tell anyone

1:20:51.066 --> 1:20:52.067
that you went
there at Morden?

1:20:52.101 --> 1:20:53.201
Because exactly this
is what's going to happen!

1:20:53.235 --> 1:20:55.938
We're trying to improve... We're
trying to help you,

1:20:55.971 --> 1:20:57.839
- your dad and I!
- And you're helping me by what?

1:20:57.873 --> 1:20:59.642
- Yes! Exactly!
- You haven't even asked me

1:20:59.674 --> 1:21:01.577
if I'm fine, Mom!

1:21:01.611 --> 1:21:04.113
You know my boyfriend
left me, right?

1:21:04.147 --> 1:21:05.982
Did you ask me
if I'm okay?

1:21:08.084 --> 1:21:12.589
You want to know why I
married Bong, Mom?

1:21:12.621 --> 1:21:16.993
I married Bong to
make you guys happy.

1:21:17.027 --> 1:21:18.996
- Because you always...
- I married him

1:21:19.028 --> 1:21:21.832
because I thought it would
make the family happy.

1:21:21.866 --> 1:21:23.000
It would bring us together

1:21:23.032 --> 1:21:25.001
and for once, for once,

1:21:25.035 --> 1:21:28.239
I don't feel
like I'm... I'm a cloud,

1:21:28.273 --> 1:21:31.476
a dark fucking cloud that
just everyone looks down on.

1:21:31.510 --> 1:21:34.646
Why can't you just get
someone like Justin?

1:21:34.679 --> 1:21:38.084
You think Justin
is so perfect, don't you?

1:21:38.116 --> 1:21:39.886
- Yeah!
- When that guy is a creep!

1:21:39.918 --> 1:21:42.087
He tries to touch women in
the most inappropriate ways!

1:21:42.120 --> 1:21:43.957
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- Mom, he is a pervert!

1:21:43.989 --> 1:21:45.691
- Come on.
- And you're making Agnes

1:21:45.725 --> 1:21:48.093
- marry this man?
- I don't believe you.

1:21:48.127 --> 1:21:50.764
Agnes is making the same mistake
as I did three years ago!

1:21:50.797 --> 1:21:51.598
- No.
- It's going to ruin her!

1:21:51.630 --> 1:21:53.566
I don't know what's
wrong with you.

1:21:53.599 --> 1:21:57.637
It's going to ruin her, Mom,
the same way that it ruined me!

1:22:01.776 --> 1:22:05.280
I would do anything, anything,

1:22:05.313 --> 1:22:07.182
just to take back
everything that I did

1:22:07.215 --> 1:22:11.253
and make this
all okay.

1:22:12.786 --> 1:22:16.825
So can you come back and
work this out, please?

1:23:37.713 --> 1:23:41.750
End of the line, pal.

1:24:19.458 --> 1:24:20.893
Hey, man.

1:24:20.926 --> 1:24:22.928
We're closed.

1:24:26.266 --> 1:24:28.302
Yeah.

1:25:26.431 --> 1:25:29.901
Simon!
You're home!

1:25:29.933 --> 1:25:32.870
You... you're home!
How long have you been home?

1:25:32.904 --> 1:25:34.505
Were you going to call me
if you were going to...

1:25:34.539 --> 1:25:35.874
- I was trying...
- Okay.

1:25:35.906 --> 1:25:37.309
- I was worried sick!
- Yeah, I know.

1:25:37.343 --> 1:25:38.344
- And you...
- Look, I'm sorry.

1:25:38.376 --> 1:25:39.411
And you left without
a coat, and...

1:25:39.444 --> 1:25:41.347
- Yeah, I know I did.
- ...you left your stupid phone!

1:25:41.380 --> 1:25:42.315
- I know. I didn't think about it.
- I...

1:25:42.348 --> 1:25:43.983
That's why I didn't
wear shoes or a coat,

1:25:44.015 --> 1:25:45.852
because I
wasn't thinking, okay?

1:25:45.884 --> 1:25:47.319
I wasn't. I didn't
think about it.

1:25:47.353 --> 1:25:50.424
It's just a thing that I do,
and the cat's out of the bag.

1:25:50.457 --> 1:25:52.426
That's a part of me,
and it's weird.

1:25:52.458 --> 1:25:54.528
I know it is,
but I just feel

1:25:54.560 --> 1:25:55.962
like I don't
have control over it,

1:25:55.996 --> 1:25:57.498
because it's,
like, this thing

1:25:57.531 --> 1:25:58.832
that I inherited
from my mom.

1:25:58.864 --> 1:26:00.099
And I swear to God,
I'm working on it,

1:26:00.132 --> 1:26:03.805
but sometimes, it's just really
hard to not... act like that.

1:26:03.837 --> 1:26:07.141
And that's... Oh,
that's... not great.

1:26:07.175 --> 1:26:11.113
And I'm sorry
if I scared you.

1:26:14.149 --> 1:26:16.252
You did.

1:26:17.419 --> 1:26:19.889
You just had me
so worried, okay? I...

1:26:19.922 --> 1:26:21.790
I know.

1:26:21.824 --> 1:26:25.862
You can't just leave and not
tell people where you're going.

1:26:27.030 --> 1:26:30.032
And we just had that big fight,
and I wasn't...

1:26:30.066 --> 1:26:32.068
Hey.

1:26:35.004 --> 1:26:37.507
Are you okay?

1:26:37.541 --> 1:26:39.277
Yeah.

1:26:59.364 --> 1:27:02.101
That's not fair.

1:27:02.133 --> 1:27:03.602
I mean,

1:27:03.636 --> 1:27:06.138
do you know what
it was like for me

1:27:06.172 --> 1:27:09.075
to just be left there

1:27:09.107 --> 1:27:11.343
at that stupid airport
after you had just told me

1:27:11.377 --> 1:27:13.947
that we needed
to sow our wild oats?

1:27:13.981 --> 1:27:16.517
And so I did.

1:27:16.549 --> 1:27:17.650
Do you know what
it feels like

1:27:17.684 --> 1:27:20.588
to just betray the one person
that you love the most

1:27:20.620 --> 1:27:23.223
and then just think that
it's completely fine?

1:27:23.257 --> 1:27:25.092
- Look. I know. I know. I know.
- And I wasn't even sure

1:27:25.124 --> 1:27:26.627
if you were going to
come home anymore,

1:27:26.661 --> 1:27:29.598
and then you just...

1:27:29.630 --> 1:27:31.232
- And then you leave again.
- Wait. Don't.

1:27:31.265 --> 1:27:33.934
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. You're right.

1:27:33.968 --> 1:27:36.504
You're right. I fucked up.

1:27:36.536 --> 1:27:40.576
It was my fault. It was my
fault. I made you...

1:27:43.011 --> 1:27:44.546
- Please don't. Don't. I'm sorry.
- I didn't even know

1:27:44.579 --> 1:27:47.949
if you were going to
come back anymore.

1:27:47.983 --> 1:27:50.220
And then you leave again
and again and again.

1:27:50.252 --> 1:27:51.921
Please, please, please,
please, please.

1:27:51.954 --> 1:27:54.992
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1:27:55.025 --> 1:27:56.326
I'm sorry.

1:27:56.359 --> 1:27:58.061
I'm sorry.

1:28:08.004 --> 1:28:10.307
Any more secrets
you want to get out?

1:28:13.445 --> 1:28:14.979
Because now would
be the time.

1:28:15.013 --> 1:28:17.249
I think it's your
turn, actually.

1:28:17.281 --> 1:28:21.452
- Oh, my turn.
- Uh-huh.

1:28:21.486 --> 1:28:25.225
Is there anything else you
wanted to tell me?

1:28:25.257 --> 1:28:27.426
No.

1:28:31.163 --> 1:28:34.033
Nothing at all, huh?

1:28:36.301 --> 1:28:39.707
Not even from
our first date?

1:28:39.739 --> 1:28:40.675
No.

1:28:53.355 --> 1:28:55.991
Why won't
you just tell me?

1:29:01.263 --> 1:29:02.265
I went to Morden.

1:29:03.465 --> 1:29:05.701
I saw your house.

1:29:05.735 --> 1:29:08.271
The girl next door told me.
I know about your dad.

1:29:08.303 --> 1:29:10.440
I know your
mom left.

1:29:14.143 --> 1:29:16.012
Why won't
you just tell me?

1:29:24.453 --> 1:29:26.190
You're wrong.

1:29:26.224 --> 1:29:27.759
Whatever you heard,
it's about someone else.

1:29:27.792 --> 1:29:29.361
It isn't me.

1:29:29.394 --> 1:29:32.463
No, no, no. No, no, no.
It's okay. It's okay.

1:29:32.497 --> 1:29:34.499
No. That girl, Allison,

1:29:34.532 --> 1:29:36.333
she's talking
about someone else.

1:29:36.367 --> 1:29:38.004
It isn't me.

1:29:38.037 --> 1:29:39.504
No, no, no. It's okay.

1:29:39.538 --> 1:29:42.475
Just look at me.

1:29:42.507 --> 1:29:45.377
I see you.

1:29:47.212 --> 1:29:49.215
Oh.

1:29:55.454 --> 1:29:57.289
Seriously?

1:29:57.322 --> 1:29:59.493
You are lying
to my face, Simon,

1:29:59.526 --> 1:30:02.096
and you don't get to
just walk away from me.

1:30:02.129 --> 1:30:04.499
Stop it. I just gave
up so much for you, and...

1:30:04.531 --> 1:30:06.266
Stop it! Hey!

1:30:06.299 --> 1:30:09.770
Get... You're not
going anywhere. Stop!

1:30:09.804 --> 1:30:13.042
I love you, okay?

1:30:13.074 --> 1:30:17.112
And... But you
have to let me in.

1:30:18.246 --> 1:30:21.083
You have to stop
locking me out

1:30:21.116 --> 1:30:25.154
and just running away.

1:30:26.489 --> 1:30:28.525
You won't...

1:30:28.557 --> 1:30:32.194
You won't... you won't tell
me the truth about your family.

1:30:32.228 --> 1:30:34.596
You won't fricking play
bass for me,

1:30:34.630 --> 1:30:37.168
like I'm not good
enough for you.

1:30:59.389 --> 1:31:03.462
Look, you can't do that
anymore, Simon, okay?

1:31:03.496 --> 1:31:05.565
Your mom left,

1:31:05.598 --> 1:31:07.300
and your dad...

1:31:07.332 --> 1:31:10.769
All that stuff,
that's you.

1:31:10.803 --> 1:31:14.841
But you can't just keep
lying to me about it.

1:31:16.676 --> 1:31:17.577
One-night stands.

1:31:17.610 --> 1:31:19.645
You can go back to
all of that bullshit,

1:31:19.679 --> 1:31:22.649
but I... I want more.

1:31:24.583 --> 1:31:28.323
No. I'm fucking done!

1:31:28.355 --> 1:31:29.790
I... don't...

1:31:29.824 --> 1:31:32.894
need it any... any more!

1:32:03.260 --> 1:32:06.197
Did you just have an
orgasm while dumping me?

1:32:06.229 --> 1:32:08.232
Yes.

1:32:16.874 --> 1:32:18.877
Yes.

1:32:57.751 --> 1:32:59.687
- Appreciate the ride.
- No problem, man.

1:32:59.720 --> 1:33:01.657
- If you just, like...
- That's what I do.

1:33:01.689 --> 1:33:02.958
...wait outside,
it's going to be...

1:33:02.992 --> 1:33:04.594
Oh, no, man.
You're going to a social.

1:33:04.627 --> 1:33:06.829
I'm coming inside with
you. That's no question.

1:33:06.862 --> 1:33:09.599
I... Well,
I mean, again,

1:33:09.631 --> 1:33:10.632
I think it's
going to be, uh,

1:33:10.667 --> 1:33:13.870
kind of a stealth in-and-out
sort of scenario.

1:33:13.903 --> 1:33:16.906
No, I'm coming in.

1:33:16.940 --> 1:33:18.674
Alright.

1:33:18.708 --> 1:33:20.911
You look good. It's a
bit of a different look

1:33:20.944 --> 1:33:23.946
from the last time we,
uh... talked.

1:33:23.980 --> 1:33:25.016
- You think so?
- Yeah.

1:33:25.048 --> 1:33:26.450
- You like it?
- Yeah, man.

1:33:26.483 --> 1:33:28.620
Yeah. I think
this is more...

1:33:28.652 --> 1:33:31.321
This is more me,
you know?

1:33:31.355 --> 1:33:33.991
Yeah. Yeah. Totally.

1:33:40.299 --> 1:33:42.801
- Hey!
- Hi! How are you?

1:33:42.834 --> 1:33:43.969
Good! Thank you
for coming!

1:33:44.001 --> 1:33:45.603
Hey! Good
to see you, man.

1:33:45.637 --> 1:33:48.006
How are you?

1:33:48.040 --> 1:33:50.310
I think we're out
of the...

1:34:03.824 --> 1:34:05.626
- No dumplings?
- That one is karioka!

1:34:05.658 --> 1:34:07.527
- Karioka.
- Karioka. Yeah. Karioka.

1:34:07.560 --> 1:34:10.563
Do you want one?

1:34:10.596 --> 1:34:11.765
Oh, you made it!

1:34:11.798 --> 1:34:13.802
- Hey!
- Of course you did.

1:34:13.834 --> 1:34:15.936
How are you?

1:34:15.969 --> 1:34:17.739
Thanks again for helping
me out in Morden.

1:34:17.771 --> 1:34:18.707
Of course, of course.

1:34:18.740 --> 1:34:21.443
Uh, it didn't work out
with Simon so well.

1:34:21.476 --> 1:34:22.411
- That's too bad.
- It's okay.

1:34:22.444 --> 1:34:24.579
I just have to do stuff,
but please have fun.

1:34:24.611 --> 1:34:25.647
- Yeah.
- Okay, thanks.

1:34:25.680 --> 1:34:26.915
See you.

1:34:26.949 --> 1:34:28.951

1:34:38.594 --> 1:34:40.730
Hey, Iris.
How's it going?

1:34:40.764 --> 1:34:41.965
- Hi.
- What the fuck are you doing?

1:34:41.997 --> 1:34:43.767
- Oh, I'm sorry! Uh, I'm sorry!
- Are you serious?

1:34:43.800 --> 1:34:45.502
- Yeah. I... I didn't mean to.
- We just talked about this!

1:34:45.535 --> 1:34:46.502
- I know.
- She doesn't like it!

1:34:46.536 --> 1:34:47.504
I was just... I
know! I'm sorry!

1:34:47.536 --> 1:34:48.839
- Tonight of all nights?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1:34:48.872 --> 1:34:50.474
- Just stop!
- Yes. I'm sorry.

1:34:50.507 --> 1:34:51.608
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1:34:51.641 --> 1:34:54.078
Jesus! Are you okay?

1:34:54.112 --> 1:34:56.815

you're security at a social.

You take it easy. You're
not the SWAT team.

1:37:21.204 --> 1:37:23.706
Yeah, and you walked
into a social

1:37:23.740 --> 1:37:25.510
and said you
were the band,

1:37:25.542 --> 1:37:28.179
and you were
not the band, so...

1:37:28.211 --> 1:37:30.982
Yeah. Well, I'm saying
it's excessive.

1:37:31.015 --> 1:37:33.518

I'm sorry. I... I...

1:38:03.183 --> 1:38:04.184
You couldn't have
just called me

1:38:04.218 --> 1:38:07.054
if you wanted to play
your bass over the phone?

1:38:07.086 --> 1:38:09.122
- That would've been fine, Simon.
- I... I just felt

1:38:09.156 --> 1:38:10.091
that if I did
something big enough...

1:38:10.124 --> 1:38:11.992
And I had to... I had
to fight for the band.

1:38:12.025 --> 1:38:13.228
You know, this is
my sister's social.

1:38:13.260 --> 1:38:17.098
I don't need
this right now.

1:38:17.130 --> 1:38:19.166
Okay.

1:38:22.303 --> 1:38:26.074
My mom wants to
meet you.

1:38:27.042 --> 1:38:30.713
- Like, to kill me or...
- No, no!

1:38:30.746 --> 1:38:31.980
She thinks
you're sweet,

1:38:32.014 --> 1:38:36.619
and... she
liked your song.

1:38:36.653 --> 1:38:39.356
Clearly, she's
tone deaf, but...

1:38:39.388 --> 1:38:41.223
Come on.

1:38:41.257 --> 1:38:43.661
Uh... okay.

1:38:50.034 --> 1:38:52.370
- Yeah. I'm really sorry.
- Yes, Simon. Okay. I know.

1:38:52.402 --> 1:38:54.905
Literally everybody that
I know on this Earth

1:38:54.938 --> 1:38:58.175
knows that
you're sorry.

1:38:58.209 --> 1:39:00.245
Yeah, okay.

1:39:03.314 --> 1:39:07.352
Like, I still can't
believe you did that.
