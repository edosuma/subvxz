02:02.878 --> 02:06.879
This is the story of a squad of marines,
a rifle squad.

02:07.257 --> 02:10.818
I'm Corporal Robert Dunne,
a member of that squad.

02:11.177 --> 02:14.737
We were at Guadalcanal,
and when it was secure

02:15.098 --> 02:19.939
we were pulled out for rest, refitting,
replacements and retraining.

02:20.352 --> 02:24.432
The Marine Corps is long on training
and retraining...

02:24.815 --> 02:26.654
Let that go.

02:26.942 --> 02:30.903
After the canal, we were sent to
Camp Paekakariki in New Zealand.

02:31.281 --> 02:35.641
Here we received our replacements,
marines from Stateside,

02:36.036 --> 02:40.596
a long way from Stateside, 8,000 miles.

02:44.502 --> 02:47.902
I can see you're a man
who knows how to live.

02:48.258 --> 02:50.257
- Solid comfort.
- Solid malaria.

02:50.550 --> 02:55.470
- Malaria, huh? Contagious?
- No, not this week. You can stay.

02:55.890 --> 03:00.249
Nice place you got here.
Regazzi's my name, Benny Regazzi.

03:00.643 --> 03:02.803
Bob Dunne. I'm duty NCO today.

03:03.104 --> 03:07.064
Great. Meet my friends. This big guy
is "Handsome" Dan Shipley.

03:07.441 --> 03:09.401
- Hi.
- What a physique!

03:09.692 --> 03:14.372
The girls see him and faint. He comes
through this, I'll make him a movie star!

03:14.781 --> 03:17.901
Those two guys, Flynns.
That's Eddie and that's Frank.

03:18.242 --> 03:20.201
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hello, Bob.

03:20.496 --> 03:22.935
They don't drink. I got their beer ration.

03:23.247 --> 03:26.287
- And Georgie Hellenopolis, an Irishman.
- Hello, sport.

03:26.626 --> 03:29.906
- Where did you get those cards?
- Off your sack on the ship. Why?

03:30.254 --> 03:34.574
- They're mine, that's why.
- I've seen lots in those bags that aren't.

03:34.967 --> 03:37.727
- Come on, give me.
- "Semper fi", Mac.

03:38.970 --> 03:42.131
- Hey!
- Leave them. It happens 20 times a day.

03:46.229 --> 03:50.269
You know where those guys come from?
Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love.

03:52.904 --> 03:57.143
- By the way, who's the squad leader?
- Sergeant Stryker.

03:57.531 --> 03:59.491
- What's he like?
- You'll find out.

03:59.783 --> 04:02.983
I've been in New Zealand two hours
and already they're clamming up on me.

04:10.377 --> 04:13.337
- I hope he knows his stuff.
- Maybe we'll get liberty.

04:13.671 --> 04:18.471
- We ain't replacements any more.
- Where is he? Where's the sergeant?

04:18.884 --> 04:20.845
He's here.

04:21.137 --> 04:24.576
- Well, what do you know? Stryker.
- Hello, Thomas.

04:24.931 --> 04:29.571
- Thought you were in the First.
- I was. Sit down.

04:29.978 --> 04:32.139
Just sit down, Thomas, anywhere.

04:37.861 --> 04:41.822
My name is Stryker,
Sergeant John M Stryker.

04:42.199 --> 04:45.000
You're gonna be my squad, a rifle squad.

04:45.328 --> 04:49.929
Three of us have seen action: Corporal
Dunne, Charlie Bass and myself.

04:50.333 --> 04:54.294
You'll learn from us. In boot camp
you learned out of a book.

04:54.671 --> 05:00.351
Here you gotta remember the book and
learn things that haven't been printed.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.762
You gotta learn right and fast.

05:04.429 --> 05:10.029
Any man that doesn't want to cooperate,
I'll make him wish he hadn't been born.

05:10.477 --> 05:15.036
Before I'm through with you, you're
gonna move and think like one man.

05:15.439 --> 05:20.280
If you don't, you'll be dead.
You guys have had a nice easy day.

05:20.695 --> 05:25.816
I hope you enjoyed it because it's the
last one you'll get for a long time.

05:26.241 --> 05:30.602
You joined the Marines to fight and
you'll get your chance. I'll show you how.

05:30.995 --> 05:35.395
If I can't teach you one way, I'll teach
you another. But I'll get the job done.

05:35.793 --> 05:38.793
The skipper of this outfit
is Captain Joyce.

05:39.129 --> 05:43.649
Platoon leader is Lieutenant Baker.
Platoon sergeant is Sergeant Wright.

05:44.050 --> 05:46.010
Any questions?

05:47.513 --> 05:49.473
That's all.

05:53.852 --> 05:56.893
10,000 sergeants in this corps
and I draw Stryker!

05:57.232 --> 05:59.271
You knew this guy before?

06:00.442 --> 06:03.884
Yeah. We were stationed
together in China.

06:04.239 --> 06:07.758
Twice he kept me from promotion.
Turned me in once.

06:08.118 --> 06:13.717
30 days I got.
He was a sergeant major then.

06:14.164 --> 06:17.283
Must have done something to get busted
to three stripes.

06:17.625 --> 06:20.185
What did he turn you in for?

06:20.502 --> 06:26.062
For... That's not important!
What's important is that he turned me in!

06:26.509 --> 06:30.908
Maybe he didn't write the manual, but
you can bet he can recite it backwards!

06:31.303 --> 06:38.143
- It's probably tattooed on his chest.
- Front and back, Mac.

06:38.644 --> 06:42.044
- Say, isn't your name Al Thomas?
- Yeah.

06:42.399 --> 06:45.358
- Weren't you a fighter?
- Just in the Marines.

06:45.694 --> 06:51.295
- Runner-up in the heavyweight division.
- Tell him who you were runner-up to.

06:51.741 --> 06:55.023
Stryker. Lucky punch.

06:55.370 --> 06:57.810
Meet your new manager.

06:58.124 --> 07:01.604
Tell him why you lost your stripes.

07:01.961 --> 07:07.401
My natural dislike for you is
gradually developing into a great hate.

07:07.842 --> 07:12.402
Don't let this guy do your thinking.
You'll get a square deal from Stryker.

07:12.804 --> 07:14.843
You bet. Square deal.

07:15.138 --> 07:20.699
I'm looking forward to the first time
he and I come head to head off duty.

07:21.145 --> 07:24.705
Hey, take it easy
with that hand, champ!

07:28.236 --> 07:29.676
Saddle up!

08:18.617 --> 08:22.177
- All right, take a break.
- Take a break.

08:24.705 --> 08:31.186
- How does your squad look?
- See me in about six months. Conway!

08:36.719 --> 08:41.597
I was checking the records.
Your father was Colonel Sam Conway.

08:42.013 --> 08:47.093
- What if he was?
- I was with him ten months ago.

08:47.520 --> 08:50.360
He was my CO before he got killed.

08:50.690 --> 08:55.010
One of the best officers and finest men
I ever served under.

08:55.403 --> 08:58.963
- I thought if you...
- Thanks. I'll keep it in mind.

09:07.248 --> 09:10.208
- For that, you sleep with your rifle.
- It was an accident.

09:10.544 --> 09:13.705
- Nobody in this outfit drops their rifle.
- Fall in!

09:14.047 --> 09:17.287
All right, saddle up. Pick it up.

09:18.509 --> 09:22.509
Sometimes I don't know
which I hate worse, him or the Nips.

09:26.893 --> 09:31.172
- Your father was a good marine.
- Until ten months ago.

09:31.562 --> 09:36.803
- You shipped in when he was killed.
- I shipped in because I was expected to.

09:37.235 --> 09:40.916
In war the men of my family
join the Marines.

09:41.281 --> 09:44.120
I'm the last Conway, so here I am.

09:44.450 --> 09:48.050
He'd be proud that
you're carrying on the tradition.

09:48.412 --> 09:52.693
Not my father. He'd have expected me
to find some soft duty somewhere.

09:53.083 --> 09:56.563
- In fact, he told me so.
- I don't get it.

09:56.921 --> 10:01.722
I embarrassed my father. I wasn't
tough enough for him. Too soft.

10:02.133 --> 10:07.454
"No guts" was the phrase he used.
He wanted me to be like Stryker.

10:07.890 --> 10:13.810
"The finest man I ever served under."
I bet they got along just fine.

10:14.271 --> 10:19.632
Both with ramrods strapped on their
backs. I'm a civilian, not a marine.

10:20.069 --> 10:24.070
They're not going to strap one on mine.
I'm in here strictly for tradition.

10:24.448 --> 10:27.286
- That the only reason?
- Yeah. Why?

10:27.617 --> 10:31.297
Nothing... Stryker knows his business.

10:31.663 --> 10:33.823
So did Jack the Ripper.

10:34.124 --> 10:37.965
Knock off the skylarking.
You're in the wrong column.

10:42.799 --> 10:45.638
Left foot close in there.

10:45.969 --> 10:47.647
Look alive!

11:01.150 --> 11:04.550
Choynski, you're all left feet!

11:04.903 --> 11:08.785
Choynski! What do you think
you're doing?

11:09.158 --> 11:12.718
- Running the bayonet course, sir.
- Not in this league.

11:13.078 --> 11:15.038
Yes, sir.

11:17.916 --> 11:20.997
Your men are pretty ragged, Stryker.

11:21.337 --> 11:23.297
Yes, sir.

11:25.132 --> 11:29.412
That ought to take some starch
out of Stryker. His boys didn't do so well.

11:29.804 --> 11:33.284
Hanging him up between those poles,
we'd do a lot better.

11:35.933 --> 11:37.934
Choynski!

11:39.103 --> 11:40.663
OK, so I'm left-handed.

11:40.938 --> 11:43.898
- On guard. Give me your rifle.
- What is this?

11:44.233 --> 11:48.753
You can't learn the easy way, you'll learn
the hard way. Make a thrust.

11:49.154 --> 11:52.434
- Without a scabbard?
- You heard me.

11:53.659 --> 11:57.218
- You mean this way?
- Yeah, like this!

12:00.123 --> 12:03.603
You get the idea? Corpsman!

12:05.294 --> 12:09.495
All right, saddle up.
We'll do it again. Pick it up.

12:18.267 --> 12:20.908
You're the only unkissable guy in camp.

12:21.229 --> 12:27.187
This thing hurts. It ain't funny. No dame's
going to come near a mouth like this.

12:27.651 --> 12:31.571
Don't worry, I got the scoop.
No liberty for three months. You got time.

12:31.948 --> 12:36.467
- Three months? How did you get that?
- I got spies everywhere.

12:36.867 --> 12:40.389
They ought to throw the book at Stryker
for doing this.

12:40.747 --> 12:44.787
They won't. They'll give him a citation
for teaching us to be good marines.

12:45.167 --> 12:47.448
Choynski!

12:49.464 --> 12:53.503
They tell me you're going to live.
You were lucky today.

12:53.883 --> 12:59.243
Someone had been instructing you that
didn't like you, you might not have been.

12:59.681 --> 13:04.481
You better put in a little homework
on that bayonet course.

13:05.979 --> 13:11.378
Somebody who didn't like me? I wonder
what he does to the guys he hates.

13:14.363 --> 13:18.723
365 days in a year and
I gotta pick this one to nick myself!

13:19.117 --> 13:21.157
You need a blow torch on your stubble.

13:21.454 --> 13:24.854
Look who's putting out the scuttlebutt.
No liberty, he says!

13:25.207 --> 13:28.167
Somebody made a mistake.
You got no kick coming.

13:28.502 --> 13:31.781
You have, so don't go turning your back.

13:35.175 --> 13:39.134
Will we take Hollywood
with them physiques!

13:40.679 --> 13:43.680
- First Platoon!
- That's for me!

13:46.101 --> 13:50.023
- Here, Wright, any mail for Stryker?
- No.

13:50.398 --> 13:52.478
It's going to be rugged again tonight.

13:52.775 --> 13:55.735
He won't solve his problems
with whiskey.

13:56.070 --> 13:59.031
What would you do
if your wife left with your kid?

13:59.365 --> 14:03.324
- After five years I'd forget it.
- Stryker's not much on forgetting.

14:09.832 --> 14:13.351
- Sorry, no letter for you.
- I know it.

14:13.710 --> 14:19.591
You know ten-year-olds. There could be
a thousand reasons why he didn't write.

14:20.050 --> 14:22.170
- A million.
- Cut it out.

14:22.470 --> 14:26.191
- Cut what out?
- Brushing me. The kid's all right.

14:26.557 --> 14:30.597
- Maybe Mary influenced him not to.
- That she wouldn't do.

14:30.978 --> 14:33.578
Of course not.

14:33.899 --> 14:37.539
Stryker, you're a very unusual character.

14:37.903 --> 14:40.863
- Can this be love?
- You know what I mean.

14:41.198 --> 14:47.996
A lot of guys wouldn't see that a woman
needs a husband who's not always away.

14:48.496 --> 14:53.456
A woman wants a home and a guy
to come in and out on time every day.

14:53.875 --> 14:58.355
- You can tell me to shut up.
- If you can't talk to me, who can?

14:58.755 --> 15:02.315
- Don't do it, just for once, don't do it.
- Do what?

15:02.676 --> 15:07.394
Don't start out to get blind, staggering,
stinking, falling down drunk.

15:07.805 --> 15:11.766
Nobody starts out to get blind,
staggering, stinking, falling down drunk.

15:12.144 --> 15:15.102
Some do. Why not leave
half your dough with me?

15:15.438 --> 15:19.157
You got an old maid's failings. You worry.

15:19.524 --> 15:24.525
Don't try to follow me tonight or I'll put
a dent in that ugly head of yours.

15:26.867 --> 15:28.826
- Ready?
- Just a minute.

15:29.119 --> 15:30.478
- What's up?
- Nothing.

15:30.744 --> 15:35.025
Benny didn't strip his M1 fast enough
for Stryker, so he turned him in.

15:35.416 --> 15:37.575
They cancelled his liberty.

15:37.878 --> 15:44.078
Perhaps our sergeant hasn't got a heart
of gold after all, but he certainly is...

15:44.551 --> 15:49.790
You talk too much. You think I restricted
Flynn for my own amusement?

15:50.222 --> 15:56.183
The punishment's unreasonable,
to cancel his liberty for a minor mistake.

15:56.645 --> 16:01.484
I'm gonna tell you something, Conway.
I'm gonna tell all of you.

16:01.900 --> 16:05.539
I'm gonna make it simple
so you'll all understand it.

16:05.904 --> 16:09.783
They handed me you guys as a present,
a regular Easter basket.

16:10.157 --> 16:14.398
They told me to get you into shape
so you can handle a piece of this war.

16:14.788 --> 16:21.229
That's what I'm gonna do and that means
I'm gonna tell you what to do every day,

16:21.710 --> 16:25.390
how to button your buttons
and when to blow your noses.

16:25.756 --> 16:31.278
If you do something I don't like I'm gonna
jump and when I land it'll hurt.

16:31.721 --> 16:38.402
I'll ride you until you can't stand up.
When you do, you'll be marines.

16:38.895 --> 16:41.655
Flynn stays here.

16:43.023 --> 16:49.544
Extra-hard product of a hard school.
Tough luck, Flynn.

16:50.030 --> 16:53.070
- If my brother doesn't go, I'm not going.
- Shut up!

16:53.449 --> 16:55.809
- Who are you telling to shut up?
- You!

16:56.119 --> 17:01.079
Let's go before we all lose our liberty.
I wanna see those Wellington babes.

17:24.563 --> 17:29.202
- How do you feel, boy?
- Like a little bird with feathers on it.

17:29.609 --> 17:34.571
- Don't fly away, little bird.
- I can't. I'm still in the egg.

17:37.617 --> 17:40.458
Beautiful, beautiful! I wanna dance.

17:40.788 --> 17:42.909
You're gonna sit down.

17:43.206 --> 17:47.327
Yes, ma'am, Tennessee,
that's where I come from.

17:47.712 --> 17:51.871
The greatest state in the Union.
They call it the volunteer state.

17:52.257 --> 17:58.417
Right there is where I'm from.
Smithville, Tennessee, what a town!

17:58.889 --> 18:03.969
These are all my cousins on my mama's
side and these are on my papa's side.

18:04.393 --> 18:07.074
We got the best tobacco there is, too.

18:07.396 --> 18:13.078
More fertiliser comes from Tennessee
than any other place in the world.

18:15.153 --> 18:18.112
Listen to that band! Zombies!
They're all dead.

18:18.449 --> 18:22.408
- Maybe they like music that way here.
- Or don't know any other kind.

18:22.785 --> 18:27.545
- I'm talking these boys into a session.
- Maybe they don't have it in them.

18:27.955 --> 18:31.397
After I'm through, they will.
They're breaking my heart.

18:31.753 --> 18:34.713
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!

18:47.770 --> 18:50.810
- There is a happy man.
- Wait until tomorrow.

18:51.148 --> 18:55.149
- Don't be a killjoy, dance. I'll watch him.
- I'm not much on dancing.

18:55.528 --> 18:59.087
- You might try just this once.
- No, thanks.

19:35.774 --> 19:38.975
- Pete's my name, Pete Conway.
- Allison.

19:39.318 --> 19:42.800
- Hello, Allison.
- Hello, Pete.

19:58.336 --> 20:03.538
- You're warm. Want to sit down?
- No. I don't want to lose you.

20:03.969 --> 20:06.928
- Cutting in.
- Shove off, Mac.

20:46.675 --> 20:49.836
What would you say if I suggested
we get some air?

20:50.179 --> 20:55.900
I'd say I'm not supposed to leave the club
with servicemen, but to you I'd say yes.

21:00.064 --> 21:03.225
Now what?
We know all about each other.

21:03.568 --> 21:08.568
- You'll be missing your train.
- I'll float back on thin air.

21:08.988 --> 21:11.748
Don't do that. You might catch cold.

21:12.075 --> 21:16.035
Funny, I've just met you and I feel
I've known you all my life.

21:16.414 --> 21:18.933
I feel that way, too.

21:19.248 --> 21:22.769
- Ten thousand miles away.
- Not now.

21:23.128 --> 21:26.168
I wanna see you again,
every time I get liberty.

21:26.506 --> 21:29.864
I'll be here.

21:30.217 --> 21:34.018
- Allison...
- Yes?

21:34.388 --> 21:37.228
I'm glad I met you tonight.

21:49.528 --> 21:52.209
- The train...
- I know.

21:53.409 --> 21:56.648
I'll walk you to the station.
I can get a taxi from there.

21:56.995 --> 21:59.315
- No, I'll walk you home.
- No.

21:59.622 --> 22:03.702
You might miss your train.
I might not see you again for a long time.

22:06.420 --> 22:12.340
Any time I get liberty, she says, just call
her up. Man, what a barmaid!

22:12.801 --> 22:18.001
- I'll finish the war right here.
- Drink any more and you probably will!

22:18.432 --> 22:24.352
New Zealand ain't got rats because
they killed them all with that whiskey!

22:24.813 --> 22:27.373
We'll drink worse before we get through.

22:27.690 --> 22:32.490
They may bury me at sea tomorrow,
but tonight I got that nice, warm feeling.

22:32.905 --> 22:36.023
I got a great future
for the next two hours.

22:36.365 --> 22:39.005
You're bleeding!

22:39.325 --> 22:40.647
Lipstick!

22:40.912 --> 22:43.831
- Hey, fellas, look what I found!
- Hey, sports...

22:45.457 --> 22:47.098
look.

22:49.376 --> 22:52.337
- Boy, he's really carrying a load!
- Gyrene!

22:54.424 --> 22:57.386
Hey, Mac, you're a little off your course.

22:58.763 --> 23:03.445
- Well, what do you know! Stryker.
- He's sure a mess.

23:03.851 --> 23:08.251
Now I know what happened
to those stripes. Come on.

23:15.029 --> 23:16.348
Shore Patrol.

23:16.613 --> 23:20.733
- That's what it is. Give me a hand.
- You're going to help him?

23:21.117 --> 23:25.877
If he cut my mother's throat five minutes
ago, I wouldn't let them get him.

23:26.288 --> 23:31.408
What a break! He's all set to drop two
stripes and Shore Patrol shows up.

23:31.837 --> 23:37.557
- But look what he done to me!
- Don't tell me he kissed you.

23:38.007 --> 23:39.687
That's a great one!

23:39.968 --> 23:44.768
Did I tell you about the guy on a train
and the funniest thing happened...

23:45.180 --> 23:49.621
- I don't know why you're helping him.
- I'll take care of it.

23:50.019 --> 23:54.140
- Where did you come from?
- Never mind. He don't need you guys.

23:54.525 --> 23:58.405
- How do you like that?
- He must follow Stryker like a little dog.

23:58.778 --> 24:03.100
What do you care?
At least he took him off our hands.

24:05.494 --> 24:10.294
A day after our leave, we drew a 22-mile
hike over terrain carefully selected.

24:10.707 --> 24:15.587
All uphill, and it was a weary bunch of
marines who pitched tents that night

24:16.004 --> 24:19.084
and gratefully folded themselves inside.

24:31.935 --> 24:35.015
Do you believe in love at first sight?

24:35.355 --> 24:37.835
All kinds.

24:38.150 --> 24:41.550
I never did before but I sure do now.

24:43.321 --> 24:48.721
- Why do you have to tell me now?
- Because I'm thinking about it now.

24:49.161 --> 24:53.080
- I'm gonna marry that girl.
- What girl?

24:53.455 --> 24:58.537
- The girl I met last night.
- You'll feel better in the morning.

24:58.960 --> 25:03.401
I couldn't feel any better
than I do right now.

25:03.800 --> 25:08.921
I've been thinking, why do men
get married during a war?

25:09.347 --> 25:13.667
- Don't know.
- It's the worst time.

25:15.270 --> 25:18.630
I fooled around
but I never thought about marriage.

25:18.981 --> 25:22.462
I know a lot of girls
back in the States but...

25:22.820 --> 25:27.579
I think it's because when you get
out here you're close to things.

25:27.989 --> 25:32.510
You realise way down inside, no matter
how much you try not to think about it,

25:32.911 --> 25:36.952
that maybe something's
got your number on...

25:37.332 --> 25:41.172
and you want to leave
a bit of yourself behind.

25:41.545 --> 25:47.424
Doesn't matter if it's a boy or a girl,
just so long as you won't be forgotten.

25:47.883 --> 25:53.165
There'll be someone who'd never
have lived if it hadn't been for you.

25:55.349 --> 25:57.949
Am I right?

26:01.354 --> 26:04.115
I think I'm right.

26:22.462 --> 26:26.381
- Hey, Conway, got a pass?
- I have.

26:26.756 --> 26:29.835
All right, hop in. I'll give you a lift.

26:39.641 --> 26:43.163
- I hear you got a girl in town.
- What if I have?

26:43.521 --> 26:48.201
- They say she's a very nice girl.
- They talk too much.

26:48.610 --> 26:51.568
Are you serious about her?

26:54.281 --> 26:59.881
With things the way they are, this is no
time to start getting serious with a girl.

27:00.328 --> 27:05.048
Don't know how long you're gonna
be here or when you'll be back again.

27:05.459 --> 27:07.940
Don't even know how long you'll live.

27:08.252 --> 27:12.374
If it's in the line of duty, you can
tell me to do something and I'll do it.

27:12.759 --> 27:15.798
As for my personal life,
keep your hands off.

27:16.136 --> 27:19.376
- Your father would've said it.
- I wouldn't have listened.

27:19.723 --> 27:22.164
- You never did.
- How do you know?

27:22.477 --> 27:25.997
- He told me.
- What did he say?

27:26.356 --> 27:29.956
I'll tell you. He said
I was a disappointment, right?

27:30.317 --> 27:34.116
He said I wouldn't be able
to stand up for myself, right?

27:34.488 --> 27:37.847
- You're doing the talking.
- No, my father is.

27:38.198 --> 27:43.040
Every time you open your mouth, he's
talking. Every thought you think is his.

27:43.455 --> 27:46.655
It's as though he's at my shoulder.

27:46.999 --> 27:51.000
But he didn't always say
or think the right thing.

27:51.380 --> 27:57.778
You're gonna find that out when the
time comes. Until then leave me alone.

27:58.260 --> 28:01.020
- You want a lift or not?
- Yeah, sure.

28:06.684 --> 28:10.805
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Why?

28:11.190 --> 28:16.070
- You've hardly said a word.
- You're right. I've been thinking.

28:16.486 --> 28:19.408
- About us?
- Myself.

28:19.741 --> 28:21.860
That's selfish.

28:22.160 --> 28:25.240
Honey, do you think I'm a brave man?

28:25.580 --> 28:29.900
- What a funny question to ask.
- Well, do you?

28:30.292 --> 28:33.212
I don't know. Why?

28:34.421 --> 28:38.180
- I've got to prove something to someone.
- Who?

28:38.550 --> 28:41.510
You don't know him. He's dead now.

28:43.387 --> 28:46.668
Yes, Pete, I think you're brave.

28:47.016 --> 28:50.976
That helps. You don't know
how much that helps.

28:51.354 --> 28:54.274
Let's not talk about it any more.

28:54.606 --> 28:59.646
We should have been talking about
ourselves all this time,

29:00.070 --> 29:02.029
what's going to happen to us.

29:02.322 --> 29:06.282
- What do you want to happen?
- I want to marry you.

29:06.660 --> 29:09.300
I want that, too.

29:11.455 --> 29:14.616
Funny, we barely know each other.

29:15.835 --> 29:21.796
We see each other for what seems
only moments. And yet...

29:22.259 --> 29:25.019
I know what you mean.

29:41.361 --> 29:46.640
- Choynski, not going to the wedding?
- No.

29:47.073 --> 29:53.634
I'd better get a transfer. I can't learn
this bayonet business. I'm all thumbs.

29:57.544 --> 30:00.703
- On guard.
- No, Sarge, not again!

30:01.047 --> 30:04.406
- I'm not well from the last time.
- On guard!

30:09.762 --> 30:13.162
- Play that thing again. You lead.
- What?

30:14.685 --> 30:16.485
You lead!

30:23.567 --> 30:26.248
Shift your weight.

30:27.614 --> 30:30.335
Left, left!

30:35.747 --> 30:40.427
There. Keep it up.
You'll get the knack of it.

30:40.836 --> 30:43.997
Practise that
about a half an hour every day.

31:06.485 --> 31:09.044
Hey, Sarge! I got it!

31:21.082 --> 31:24.042
I haven't been in church since I was 14.

31:24.375 --> 31:29.097
- Kissing the bride's a great invention.
- Sure makes me homesick.

31:29.508 --> 31:32.509
- What's the matter?
- He looks the same.

31:32.843 --> 31:37.805
- How do you expect him to look?
- Married, wrinkled, worried, like me.

31:38.226 --> 31:41.985
- 44 hours and 34 minutes left. Go!
- Excuse me, sports.

31:43.648 --> 31:46.886
Here's your wedding present
from the gang.

31:47.233 --> 31:49.354
You've all been wonderful.

31:49.653 --> 31:53.492
- Are you sure you've got the right guy?
- I'm sure.

31:53.863 --> 31:56.384
Come on, get going!

32:03.958 --> 32:09.757
- "Sempre felice", Mac!
- Keep the situation well in hand, Pete!

32:10.214 --> 32:14.094
We got 44 hours and 33 minutes.
What are we gonna do?

32:14.466 --> 32:17.307
Al, if I was a girl, I'd marry you.

32:17.635 --> 32:20.516
Knock it off! I've had a hard day.

32:20.848 --> 32:23.128
What am I doing?

32:24.893 --> 32:29.534
44 hours and 32 minutes.
That isn't very long, is it?

32:29.940 --> 32:33.261
No, not long at all.

32:33.611 --> 32:37.771
I wonder how many other people
have had 44 hours and 32 minutes.

32:38.158 --> 32:40.877
Lots I guess.

32:41.201 --> 32:44.963
- We'll make it seem a long time.
- Years.

32:54.922 --> 32:57.883
- Shall I open it?
- Sure, go ahead.

33:08.895 --> 33:10.854
They're in a hurry!

33:11.146 --> 33:13.346
Others were in a hurry.

33:13.648 --> 33:18.569
The order said move out
and the Marines moved out.

33:18.987 --> 33:24.028
11 days at sea. Destination?
Only the top brass knew.

33:24.451 --> 33:29.931
Though, of course, scuttlebutt knew the
answer, a hundred answers, all wrong.

33:30.373 --> 33:35.334
Boat Squad... halt, one, two!

33:37.004 --> 33:39.486
Dismissed!

33:42.469 --> 33:46.070
Too bad you couldn't see her again.
You didn't get long.

33:46.433 --> 33:50.392
We knew it might happen.
I'll be back. I've got to believe that.

33:50.768 --> 33:53.769
- Sure. We'll all be back.
- Gangway!

33:56.358 --> 34:02.718
That's no way to carry a flag, Regazzi.
I've got to teach you everything.

34:03.197 --> 34:07.997
Now watch this...
What are you gonna do with this, Benny?

34:08.411 --> 34:11.491
I'm gonna put that up in Tokyo,
right in the middle of Times Square.

34:11.831 --> 34:18.471
- There isn't any Times Square in Tokyo.
- There will be when I get there.

34:18.963 --> 34:23.722
Now that's the way to fold a flag,
with the blue field showing.

34:24.132 --> 34:26.092
What do you know!

34:30.516 --> 34:32.596
- You got my shirt!
- It's my shirt!

34:32.891 --> 34:36.052
- I'm telling you, it's my shirt!
- It's my shirt!

34:41.359 --> 34:45.081
Here, fellas. You'd better
quit fighting so much.

34:45.447 --> 34:48.407
If you don't, one of you's apt to get hurt.

34:51.411 --> 34:53.929
Corpsman! Corpsman!

34:57.126 --> 35:01.927
- What's that?
- Relax. It's the Navy clearing its throat.

35:02.339 --> 35:04.818
Sure don't sound like no squirrel gun.

35:05.131 --> 35:09.132
I hope they practise real good. What
island do you think we're aiming at?

35:09.511 --> 35:11.471
We'll get word.

35:12.974 --> 35:15.575
- Here it is.
- It looks like a pork chop.

35:15.894 --> 35:18.293
- What's its name?
- Tarawa.

35:18.605 --> 35:21.005
Never heard of it. It's the wrong place.

35:21.316 --> 35:24.115
It's part of an atoll called Tarawa Atoll.

35:24.444 --> 35:28.883
This particular island is called Betio.
Don't ask me how you spell it.

35:29.280 --> 35:33.239
You'll have to stick your faces into it
but you don't have to spell it.

35:33.617 --> 35:38.777
- This is Red Beach Three. That's us.
- What have they got there?

35:39.207 --> 35:43.167
Everything. This island's held
by a special naval landing force.

35:43.543 --> 35:47.745
That means Japanese marines.
They're dug in and they're mean.

35:48.132 --> 35:52.374
They'd just as soon die as stick a nickel
in a jukebox, but that's all right.

35:52.762 --> 35:56.363
Let the other guy die for his country.
You'll live for yours.

35:59.812 --> 36:02.933
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

36:03.272 --> 36:05.952
- Get over there.
- I can hear him.

36:06.276 --> 36:11.596
Get over there. I don't want anybody
hurt because you didn't listen.

36:38.681 --> 36:42.760
- Schoolteacher, do me some homework.
- What's your problem, son?

36:43.144 --> 36:47.344
Put down 5,000. Scuttlebutt says
that's how many Nips are on that rock.

36:47.732 --> 36:51.892
- The Navy fired 1,000 tons of shells.
- Don't forget the fly-fly boys.

36:52.279 --> 36:56.040
Those B-24s have really
been working them over.

36:56.409 --> 37:00.809
Now add the tons of explosives, divide it
by the Nips and get the answer.

37:01.204 --> 37:05.723
- Maybe we'll be back for noon chow.
- Don't figure that way.

37:06.124 --> 37:10.845
The Navy and the fly-fly boys unloaded
plenty on the canal before we went in.

37:11.256 --> 37:15.896
When we got ashore there were still a lot
of those lemon-coloured guys waiting.

37:16.301 --> 37:21.582
Only way that island was taken
was by putting marines on the beach.

37:22.016 --> 37:28.135
You've heard the naval foray's a waste
of time and metal. Stryker knows better.

37:28.606 --> 37:33.685
- Who cut you in on this conversation?
- You say when I can and can't talk?

37:34.108 --> 37:38.349
- Just when you can't talk to me.
- Knock it off, Conway.

37:38.740 --> 37:42.340
I've had enough of your "hardbitten
sergeant" attitude.

37:42.701 --> 37:47.461
You're so big everybody's been afraid
to take a punch at you. I'm not!

37:47.872 --> 37:50.473
Cool off!

37:50.793 --> 37:56.754
Forget that pencil and paper routine and
worry about staying alive on that beach.

37:57.218 --> 38:01.017
- Don't expect any soft touch!
- "Now hear this"!

38:01.388 --> 38:05.348
All troops report
to your debarking stations!

38:49.765 --> 38:53.926
All right, men, sound off
when your name's called.

38:54.311 --> 38:57.592
Now hear this,
there'll be no movies tonight!

40:00.293 --> 40:03.414
The place is opened up for business.

40:08.426 --> 40:11.067
- Missed!
- Maybe they're firing blanks.

40:11.389 --> 40:15.909
- Maybe a two-headed kid's aiming.
- Maybe this is just manoeuvres.

40:41.083 --> 40:45.205
Get out now. We're crossing the line
of departure. Lock and load!

41:32.341 --> 41:36.302
- Good luck, Sarge!
- Charlie, give me a hand here!

41:39.056 --> 41:43.216
Lieutenant, hit the deck! How is it?

41:43.603 --> 41:45.281
I got hit!

41:45.562 --> 41:48.842
Corpsman! You'll be all right.

41:59.657 --> 42:03.739
They got us pinned down!
We can't get over these logs!

42:04.122 --> 42:07.082
- I'm going while I can!
- Stay here, kid!

42:24.850 --> 42:28.652
We're gonna be killed here.
I'd like to get at them!

42:29.022 --> 42:31.582
Why rush? This is a nice place.

42:39.781 --> 42:43.741
- They got the lieutenant!
- They'll get all of us if we don't move.

42:44.120 --> 42:47.999
We are like fish in a barrel lying here.

42:50.124 --> 42:55.524
- Did we train to take it lying down?
- Sarge, do something about it!

42:57.673 --> 43:00.233
Stay where you are until I tell you.

43:06.515 --> 43:09.755
You gotta get us out of here!

43:10.102 --> 43:14.462
If you're nervous count your toes.
I'll do the masterminding around here.

43:23.366 --> 43:26.327
- Where's Lieutenant Baker?
- Machine-gunned.

43:26.661 --> 43:30.301
- Is your squad all right?
- All but one. What's holding us down?

43:30.665 --> 43:35.626
That bunker, an old power plant. All
these bombs and they're still killing us.

43:36.046 --> 43:39.725
- Smoke, sir?
- Thanks.

43:40.090 --> 43:44.610
I've sent for flame-throwers to assist.
Your squad will support. Follow me!

43:45.012 --> 43:48.092
You heard! Move out and stay down!

44:12.330 --> 44:14.930
We've gotta silence that bunker!

44:36.019 --> 44:39.979
Request naval gunfire
be lifted on target areas, coordinates...

44:40.358 --> 44:44.956
two-four-six-zero-sugar-tare. Over.

44:47.989 --> 44:49.949
Roger and out.

45:04.129 --> 45:08.049
Flame-throwers out! Demolition in!

45:45.253 --> 45:47.413
Demolition out!

46:02.978 --> 46:05.138
Shipley!

46:14.864 --> 46:18.304
Give me a hand with this pack.

46:55.945 --> 46:57.306
Throw it!

47:16.005 --> 47:17.965
Move out!

48:11.936 --> 48:14.657
Get him out of there!

48:24.656 --> 48:28.218
- There goes one of your nine.
- Now we got tanks.

48:28.576 --> 48:31.057
Better late than never.

48:31.372 --> 48:33.331
Come on!

48:35.876 --> 48:40.357
Corpsman! Corpsman! This way!

48:40.757 --> 48:47.476
Don't wait. They'll find me.
Keep going. Hit 'em for me.

48:48.890 --> 48:51.730
Find Stryker. Stick with him.

48:52.935 --> 48:55.454
He's good people.

48:55.772 --> 48:58.371
Tell him I...

49:42.066 --> 49:45.106
I'd like to know
where the rest of the squad went.

49:45.444 --> 49:49.084
- What's this place?
- Whatever it is it ain't healthy!

49:49.449 --> 49:50.929
Let's go!

50:00.836 --> 50:04.354
That was close.
Next time don't be in such a hurry.

50:04.714 --> 50:08.273
- You're across, ain't you?
- Across what? To where?

50:08.632 --> 50:12.993
- I'm running low on ammo.
- I am too.

50:13.387 --> 50:17.348
Forgot about that.
We gotta get some more.

50:17.725 --> 50:21.365
- I'll go.
- Wait! Pick a number from one to six.

50:21.729 --> 50:24.008
- Two.
- Five.

50:24.314 --> 50:27.234
You're both wrong.

50:36.826 --> 50:39.586
That guy kills me.

50:49.340 --> 50:51.900
Thomas better hurry!

51:00.975 --> 51:04.497
- How about some bandoliers, Mac?
- Help yourself.

51:08.441 --> 51:12.801
- How are things going up front?
- Pretty rough.

51:13.194 --> 51:16.154
- Keep it coming.
- Good luck.

51:28.419 --> 51:32.137
- Is that coffee?
- It sure is. Do you want some?

51:34.091 --> 51:37.050
Do I want some, he says!

51:39.178 --> 51:43.138
I haven't had any joe
since we left the ship.

51:49.313 --> 51:53.235
You mortarmen sure live
the life of Riley here.

51:53.611 --> 51:55.570
Here you are.

52:01.243 --> 52:03.443
Beautiful!

52:07.791 --> 52:10.312
- Where's Thomas?
- Probably dead.

52:10.626 --> 52:13.627
No, not that guy. Let's get out of here!

52:34.441 --> 52:39.200
- Can I have some for my buddies?
- Sure. Break out your canteen.

52:39.612 --> 52:43.173
Tell me, how's everything been going?

52:44.949 --> 52:49.032
Couldn't be better, Mac.
Oh, this is the life!

52:54.711 --> 52:59.592
Come and get it, you guys!
Ammo and fresh hot joe!

53:00.007 --> 53:01.288
Hellenopolis!

53:01.551 --> 53:03.511
Bass!

53:29.495 --> 53:31.455
Hey, Greek!

53:36.794 --> 53:38.793
Hey, Greek!

53:41.672 --> 53:45.273
- What kepts you, Thomas?
- Where's Bass?

53:45.634 --> 53:47.394
Gutted.

53:47.678 --> 53:49.958
No ammo.

53:51.098 --> 53:53.699
What kept you, sports?

54:18.169 --> 54:20.127
Major Crowe, sir.

54:22.837 --> 54:26.278
- Jim? How you doing?
- "It's tough going, Dave".

54:26.632 --> 54:30.312
I've committed every man.
We're dug in and staying.

54:30.678 --> 54:37.320
Good. I've been getting reports all day that
the Nips are slipping in to your front.

54:37.811 --> 54:44.289
If it's "banzai" tonight,
target area 2-41 is a hot spot.

54:44.775 --> 54:47.534
What outfit have you got there?

54:49.197 --> 54:51.556
Joyce and Stryker.

54:51.866 --> 54:55.665
Pass the word they gotta dig in
and stay put.

54:56.036 --> 54:58.435
No noise or movement.

54:58.746 --> 55:05.708
Don't risk anybody unless you have to.
Hold on until we get more men there.

55:10.050 --> 55:11.331
Yes, sir.

55:11.594 --> 55:15.914
Major Crowe says the Nips have been
filtering into these tank traps.

55:16.307 --> 55:19.388
Disperse your squad along this section.

55:19.727 --> 55:24.487
Tell your men there's to be no smoking,
no moving or unnecessary talking.

55:24.897 --> 55:28.857
If they find out how thin we are,
they can get to the beach.

55:29.236 --> 55:33.996
That's a platoon area. All I got's
a beat-up squad, short three men.

55:34.408 --> 55:37.366
- Couldn't you...?
- Can I give you three men?

55:37.701 --> 55:42.861
The battalion can't give the whole
company three replacements.

55:43.291 --> 55:46.811
Your squad is covering
the hottest spot in the line.

55:47.168 --> 55:52.208
If it's an attack tonight they'll strike you
first. They want to know our disposition.

55:52.632 --> 55:55.752
I repeat, your men are not to move.

55:56.095 --> 56:01.175
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Stryker, we're going to hold this line.

56:01.599 --> 56:04.960
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Good luck.

56:15.282 --> 56:17.922
All right, saddle up. Follow me.

56:19.118 --> 56:20.837
Everybody go!

56:26.041 --> 56:31.321
Drop off at intervals, two-man foxholes.
We're gonna be spread out thin tonight.

56:31.755 --> 56:38.475
Don't give away your position or strength.
You Flynns stay here, and no quarrels.

56:41.722 --> 56:45.402
Dunne and Smith, drop out here.

56:45.767 --> 56:49.407
No gab tonight!

56:52.649 --> 56:55.649
You and Harris here! Come on, Conway.

57:16.172 --> 57:18.132
Corpsman!

57:18.424 --> 57:20.385
Listen.

57:23.972 --> 57:26.973
- Corpsman!
- That's a marine.

57:30.355 --> 57:32.353
Corpsman!

57:36.484 --> 57:39.443
- Stryker!
- Get down and stay down!

57:39.779 --> 57:43.099
- You had your orders!
- Somebody's wounded!

57:43.449 --> 57:45.648
- Quiet.
- Let's get him!

57:45.951 --> 57:50.391
Stay down! It may be an old Jap trick.
They pulled it on the canal.

57:50.790 --> 57:57.188
- It doesn't sound like a Jap to me.
- I don't care. You'll tip our position.

58:00.673 --> 58:02.553
Stryker!

58:02.842 --> 58:06.442
It's Bass!
How many Japs know your name?

58:06.805 --> 58:08.804
- You know his voice.
- Shut up.

58:11.975 --> 58:16.137
Aren't you human at all?
A friend of yours may be dying!

58:16.524 --> 58:18.085
Knock it off!

58:18.359 --> 58:22.318
This is what my father taught you.
Be a great marine, be tough.

58:22.695 --> 58:27.975
Sit here if you want. I'm getting him.
The only way you'll stop me is to kill me.

58:28.409 --> 58:31.130
That's just what I'll do!

58:52.015 --> 58:53.976
Stryker!

58:56.020 --> 58:57.579
Stryker!

59:06.237 --> 59:08.197
Sarge!

59:10.574 --> 59:12.534
Stryker!

59:17.707 --> 59:19.788
Please, Sarge!

59:30.260 --> 59:36.502
Tarawa was officially declared secure
at 13.30 on the fourth day of battle.

59:36.976 --> 59:42.655
The replacements came ashore,
our wounded were cared for

59:43.106 --> 59:46.666
and the assault troops were relieved.

59:56.412 --> 01:00:00.411
- How am I doing, Chaplain?
- God has been good to you.

01:00:00.791 --> 01:00:03.149
You're going home.

01:00:04.377 --> 01:00:09.177
Per istam Sanctam Unctionem,
et suam piisimam,

01:00:09.590 --> 01:00:14.470
indulgeat tibi Dominus
"quidquid deliquisti. Amen".

01:00:40.788 --> 01:00:43.669
Somebody beat me to it.

01:01:28.167 --> 01:01:32.847
Skipper gave out some news.
Part of it's good, part of it's bad.

01:01:33.255 --> 01:01:37.016
- They found Hellenopolis. He's dead.
- He was a good Greek.

01:01:37.385 --> 01:01:41.985
Choynski, Soames and Bass are on
a hospital ship Stateside-bound.

01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:45.350
- I wish I was with them.
- Let's get cleaned up.

01:01:45.684 --> 01:01:49.644
Wash out those dungarees
and let's look like marines.

01:01:53.566 --> 01:01:56.326
You too, Thomas.

01:02:02.283 --> 01:02:04.324
- Dunne.
- Yeah?

01:02:07.663 --> 01:02:12.262
I got a couple of bottles of sake
in my gear. Give it to the squad.

01:02:12.667 --> 01:02:16.586
- Right.
- Tell them you got it off a dead Nip.

01:02:16.962 --> 01:02:20.203
Why don't you break down a little?

01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:23.069
You got it off a dead Nip.

01:02:23.386 --> 01:02:25.426
Aye, aye.

01:02:48.328 --> 01:02:52.608
- What's eating you?
- Know what Stryker plans tomorrow?

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.118
Another squad problem
and I'm so tired of problems!

01:02:57.502 --> 01:03:01.543
I'm tired of Stryker!
I'm also tired of beautiful Hawaii.

01:03:01.924 --> 01:03:03.885
Me, too.

01:03:05.887 --> 01:03:10.006
Hey, champ, what do you think
of beautiful Hawaii?

01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:16.430
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Clamming up again, ever since Tarawa.

01:03:16.896 --> 01:03:19.336
- Why the silence?
- Knock it off!

01:03:19.649 --> 01:03:24.570
- Hi! You got room for me?
- What do you know!

01:03:24.987 --> 01:03:27.748
- You got time off for good behaviour?
- Yeah.

01:03:28.075 --> 01:03:32.034
- Where were you? Pearl Harbor?
- Yeah, nice place. Pretty nurses.

01:03:32.410 --> 01:03:35.690
I'll give somebody $5
to shoot me in the foot.

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.880
- I'll do it for $2.50.
- You're too willing!

01:03:39.210 --> 01:03:42.651
Some replacements out here
assigned to our squad.

01:03:43.006 --> 01:03:46.565
We build up the joint
and they come and live in it.

01:03:46.926 --> 01:03:50.286
This is Stein and Fowler and McHugh.

01:03:50.639 --> 01:03:55.519
He's Fowler. Mike McHugh, from Cedar
Rapids to see this war's over in a hurry.

01:03:55.936 --> 01:03:58.295
- How old are you?
- Nineteen.

01:03:58.603 --> 01:04:02.044
- How old?
- Well, eighteen... going on eighteen.

01:04:02.399 --> 01:04:05.359
We heard that the squad leader's tough.

01:04:05.695 --> 01:04:10.895
- There are rumours to that effect.
- Tough sergeants roll off my knife!

01:04:11.324 --> 01:04:17.005
You're gonna find your first few days
with Sergeant Stryker very interesting.

01:04:17.455 --> 01:04:20.415
You new men come with me.

01:04:28.049 --> 01:04:32.249
- Attention!
- Charlie! How are you?

01:04:32.637 --> 01:04:35.677
- Certified fit for duty, so the medics say.
- Good.

01:04:36.015 --> 01:04:39.335
The replacements came up with me.

01:04:39.685 --> 01:04:42.046
They get younger all the time.

01:04:42.355 --> 01:04:45.115
- Or we're getting older.
- Or both.

01:04:45.442 --> 01:04:48.641
- I can stand having you back.
- I can stand being back.

01:04:48.987 --> 01:04:52.988
What happened to the squad, besides
the Greek, Shipley and Thomas?

01:04:53.365 --> 01:04:56.846
Choynski...
Thomas? He never got a scratch.

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:01.840
- I was sure he got it.
- Why?

01:05:02.165 --> 01:05:07.405
When we got stuck in a trench he went
back to get ammo. Never came back.

01:05:07.838 --> 01:05:12.398
How long between the time he went back
and you got overrun?

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:15.242
About 40 minutes.

01:05:15.553 --> 01:05:17.514
40 minutes?

01:05:18.848 --> 01:05:20.809
Stay here.

01:05:28.941 --> 01:05:31.381
Thomas!

01:05:31.694 --> 01:05:34.615
- Yeah?
- Outside.

01:05:44.498 --> 01:05:48.340
- What's that about?
- Don't ask me. I haven't any spies.

01:05:50.171 --> 01:05:52.891
- That's far enough.
- What's this about?

01:05:53.215 --> 01:05:55.536
Just that I hate your guts!

01:06:16.446 --> 01:06:17.886
Get up.

01:06:19.116 --> 01:06:23.755
You doped off and got one of my men
killed and one of them bayoneted!

01:06:24.161 --> 01:06:27.161
- You haven't had enough. Get up!
- Stryker...

01:06:28.330 --> 01:06:31.011
Attention! All right, break it up.

01:06:33.630 --> 01:06:37.549
- What's your name?
- Sergeant Stryker. Able Company, sir.

01:06:37.924 --> 01:06:39.284
And you?

01:06:39.551 --> 01:06:43.751
Pfc Thomas. Able Company, sir.

01:06:44.139 --> 01:06:49.101
This may take some explaining before
a court martial. Help that man up.

01:06:57.069 --> 01:07:00.150
- You'll need medical attention.
- I'll be OK, sir.

01:07:00.489 --> 01:07:05.850
That's debatable. You know it's not
permissible for an NCO to strike a man?

01:07:06.288 --> 01:07:08.847
- Yes, sir.
- Who struck the first blow?

01:07:11.833 --> 01:07:15.393
Colonel, there wasn't any first blow
struck exactly.

01:07:15.754 --> 01:07:18.713
A simultaneous explosion perhaps?

01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:24.260
Judo, sir. The sergeant was showing me
how to break a judo hold.

01:07:24.637 --> 01:07:28.437
No more judo exhibitions.
Understand, Sergeant?

01:07:28.808 --> 01:07:30.808
Aye, aye, sir.

01:07:39.816 --> 01:07:42.377
At least you're no stool pigeon.

01:07:42.695 --> 01:07:45.136
Wait a minute, Stryker.

01:07:46.324 --> 01:07:49.323
I'm wrong, dead wrong. I know it.

01:07:50.703 --> 01:07:55.265
I doped off for some coffee,
but I didn't think a few minutes mattered.

01:07:55.668 --> 01:07:59.588
- It did!
- I know that now, but I didn't then.

01:07:59.964 --> 01:08:02.364
It's killing me. I can't sleep.

01:08:02.675 --> 01:08:08.594
A hundred times I wanted to tell you,
tell somebody. I...

01:08:09.054 --> 01:08:13.655
I liked that Greek...
I'd do anything for him.

01:08:15.269 --> 01:08:19.630
If I could I'd change him
for me right now.

01:08:20.024 --> 01:08:22.904
I think you would.

01:08:23.234 --> 01:08:29.474
Guys make mistakes but every one
we make, a stack of chips goes with it.

01:08:29.951 --> 01:08:33.911
We make a mistake
and some guy don't walk away!

01:08:34.287 --> 01:08:37.287
For evermore he don't walk away.

01:08:38.791 --> 01:08:42.390
I guess all we can do is just take it...

01:08:43.837 --> 01:08:48.318
and hope we don't make
the same mistake again.

01:08:48.718 --> 01:08:50.478
I won't.

01:08:55.933 --> 01:08:57.974
Let's get back.

01:09:01.856 --> 01:09:04.417
Mail call! First Platoon.

01:09:09.823 --> 01:09:13.984
A letter from my wife after 18 months.
Know where she is?

01:09:14.368 --> 01:09:16.930
In England, entertaining troops.

01:09:17.247 --> 01:09:22.645
Entertaining troops? Why isn't she here
entertaining me? I'm a troop.

01:09:23.085 --> 01:09:28.645
"They're all such nice boys. There's
a lieutenant here..." A lieutenant!

01:09:29.091 --> 01:09:35.250
When I get back she'll need standing
up for a month! I put on muscle lately!

01:09:39.893 --> 01:09:45.653
Darling, this is a funny way for a man
to find out he's a father, but you are.

01:09:46.107 --> 01:09:50.787
It happened the day before yesterday,
just in time for breakfast.

01:09:51.196 --> 01:09:55.555
He's a boy and looks beautiful like me
and intelligent like you.

01:09:55.948 --> 01:10:02.551
I should have told you it was going to
happen, but I didn't want to worry you.

01:10:03.042 --> 01:10:07.602
I don't know what to call him.
We never discussed that.

01:10:08.005 --> 01:10:11.965
- I'm a father! Hey, I'm a father!
- Let's see!

01:10:12.342 --> 01:10:16.822
- I'm a father!
- All right, let's fall in!

01:10:20.059 --> 01:10:21.618
Come on!

01:10:27.523 --> 01:10:31.682
Finally we got our leave.
Ten days in Honolulu.

01:10:32.069 --> 01:10:36.149
All of us were out on the town.
All except Stryker.

01:10:36.532 --> 01:10:39.132
He was still the same.

01:10:59.095 --> 01:11:02.734
- Lonesome?
- Drift.

01:11:08.062 --> 01:11:10.661
- Whiskey.
- Two?

01:11:10.982 --> 01:11:15.144
- Please.
- OK.

01:11:15.529 --> 01:11:20.329
Thanks. A drink'll be good. I'm tired.
It's been a rough day...

01:11:20.743 --> 01:11:23.262
Knock it off!

01:11:23.578 --> 01:11:26.339
I'm sorry, Sergeant.

01:11:31.334 --> 01:11:33.694
- Right.
- Thanks.

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:39.359
65 cents for a drink. It's too much.
They cheat servicemen.

01:11:41.552 --> 01:11:44.192
We could drink cheaper at my house.

01:11:44.514 --> 01:11:47.195
Don't throw your arm out of joint.

01:11:50.727 --> 01:11:56.047
Thanks for the drink. I didn't mean
to make too much buzzing in your ear.

01:11:56.484 --> 01:11:59.244
It's all right, finish your drink.

01:12:04.659 --> 01:12:10.340
- I didn't mean to sound so tough.
- I know. You're just unhappy.

01:12:14.876 --> 01:12:17.238
Me, too.

01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:20.590
My name's Mary.

01:12:23.468 --> 01:12:26.749
The long arm of coincidence,
or something.

01:12:28.099 --> 01:12:30.058
Her name, too.

01:12:33.187 --> 01:12:36.067
That invitation still hold?

01:12:49.035 --> 01:12:52.595
Make yourself comfortable.
I'll fix us a drink.

01:13:00.670 --> 01:13:04.869
Oh, dear!
Well, I can get us some more in a jiffy.

01:13:13.433 --> 01:13:15.393
I see.

01:13:17.438 --> 01:13:20.039
Will a sawbuck do it?

01:13:20.357 --> 01:13:24.198
Go on, take it. It's only paper.

01:13:25.904 --> 01:13:28.825
Well, I'll be right back.

01:14:35.721 --> 01:14:40.240
- I hope this is your brand.
- Any brand is mine.

01:14:54.156 --> 01:14:58.037
- She says she's hungry.
- He.

01:15:00.621 --> 01:15:03.381
Advise him against joining the Marines.

01:15:10.255 --> 01:15:16.333
Mummy's fixing you something. Her
boy'll be quiet while she has company.

01:15:16.802 --> 01:15:21.123
Knock it off...
Where's his father?

01:15:22.684 --> 01:15:24.645
Gone.

01:15:28.189 --> 01:15:32.150
Well, I guess into each life
a little rain must fall.

01:15:37.282 --> 01:15:42.722
There are a lot tougher ways
of making a living than going to war.

01:15:49.834 --> 01:15:52.995
You know about babies.

01:15:55.299 --> 01:15:57.819
Yeah, I know about babies.

01:16:19.529 --> 01:16:21.089
So long, Mac.

01:16:26.662 --> 01:16:31.024
- Wait!
- I can't spend it on a coral reef.

01:16:31.418 --> 01:16:37.018
- You're a very good man.
- You'll get odds on that in the Marines.

01:16:37.465 --> 01:16:39.426
So long.

01:16:40.759 --> 01:16:44.080
So long, Sergeant. I'll pray for you.

01:16:44.430 --> 01:16:47.751
Let's not get religion.

01:16:48.102 --> 01:16:51.620
- I'll pray for you, Sergeant!
- Good luck.

01:16:55.357 --> 01:17:00.116
You got a lot of bloodhound in you,
Charlie, but you can call off the dogs.

01:17:00.528 --> 01:17:03.208
I'm smarter than I was 30 minutes ago.

01:17:03.531 --> 01:17:06.450
Catch me feeling sorry for myself again

01:17:06.785 --> 01:17:09.945
and you got my permission
to belt me in the nose!

01:17:10.288 --> 01:17:13.886
- Buy you a drink?
- Lock and load, boy!

01:17:22.299 --> 01:17:24.380
- Thanks!
- Two bourbon and ice.

01:17:29.598 --> 01:17:32.560
- A baby's a big event.
- Conway!

01:17:36.772 --> 01:17:40.414
- Treating the boys?
- Crack open the hatch!

01:17:40.776 --> 01:17:46.218
That's great. A fellow always gets
more kick out of a boy, I guess.

01:17:46.658 --> 01:17:50.138
I got a kid. Sam, I named him...

01:17:52.911 --> 01:17:54.872
after your old man.

01:17:55.165 --> 01:17:59.205
Wait till he gets to be ten and doesn't
write. You'll be mad enough to hit him.

01:17:59.586 --> 01:18:04.666
No, I won't, Stryker, because he won't
have to write. I'll be where he is.

01:18:05.091 --> 01:18:09.731
And I won't insist that he be tough.
I'll try to make him intelligent.

01:18:10.137 --> 01:18:15.616
And I won't insist that he read the Marine
Corps manual. I'll get him Shakespeare.

01:18:16.059 --> 01:18:19.659
I don't want him to be a Colonel Conway
or Sergeant Stryker.

01:18:20.022 --> 01:18:25.222
I want him to be intelligent, considerate,
cultured and a gentleman.

01:18:25.653 --> 01:18:28.932
- You're out of line, kid.
- Let him be. He has a right to dislike me.

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:32.680
Thanks, and I intend
to exercise that right.

01:18:33.035 --> 01:18:38.156
- I don't like you, Stryker.
- Let's talk sense for a minute, Conway.

01:18:38.582 --> 01:18:41.383
I can't have friction in the squad.

01:18:41.710 --> 01:18:47.351
I've tried every approach to you that I
know. Got nowhere. You're intelligent...

01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:52.239
Don't patronise me. Your opinion of
my IQ doesn't interest me in the least.

01:18:52.638 --> 01:18:58.357
Let's get this straight.
On duty I jump when you holler.

01:18:58.810 --> 01:19:02.969
Off duty I exercise my God-given rights
under a democracy

01:19:03.355 --> 01:19:06.075
and dislike whom I please.

01:19:07.443 --> 01:19:10.404
Do we understand each other?

01:19:17.036 --> 01:19:20.516
- Beat it.
- Come on, you guys, let's go.

01:19:32.301 --> 01:19:35.261
I don't understand
why you don't belt him.

01:19:35.595 --> 01:19:39.395
- Mellow in my old age, I guess.
- Too bad.

01:19:39.767 --> 01:19:42.567
"Screaming Sam"
couldn't be proud of him.

01:19:42.894 --> 01:19:48.296
He could. There's something inside
a guy, always proud of a kid.

01:19:48.735 --> 01:19:51.215
- Two more?
- Not for me.

01:19:51.527 --> 01:19:54.448
- I'll sail again. One.
- OK.

01:19:54.782 --> 01:19:58.062
- Maybe you can steer me home?
- Charge!

01:20:01.579 --> 01:20:03.299
Pull pins!

01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:05.580
Prepare to throw!

01:20:05.875 --> 01:20:07.834
Throw!

01:20:14.216 --> 01:20:17.457
- All right, fifth relay!
- What an arm!

01:20:17.803 --> 01:20:20.283
Pick it up!

01:20:20.598 --> 01:20:23.116
Right in the groove!

01:20:23.433 --> 01:20:26.672
- Look, boy, this is a live grenade.
- Gee!

01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:30.580
- You know what they can do?
- Yes, sir.

01:20:30.939 --> 01:20:36.900
Right hand. Wait for the order
to pull pin and pitch grenade.

01:20:37.364 --> 01:20:39.204
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

01:20:39.491 --> 01:20:41.450
Ready?

01:20:42.994 --> 01:20:44.914
Pull pin!

01:20:45.205 --> 01:20:47.565
Prepare to throw!

01:20:47.874 --> 01:20:50.275
Throw!

01:20:52.837 --> 01:20:55.357
Grenade! Hit the deck!

01:21:01.972 --> 01:21:07.732
When will you wake up? You wanna see
her again, keep your mind on your work!

01:21:08.185 --> 01:21:12.185
- What happened here?
- Little accident, sir.

01:21:12.564 --> 01:21:15.484
You're wounded. Corpsman!

01:21:15.817 --> 01:21:18.858
- Yes, sir.
- Take care of the sergeant.

01:21:19.197 --> 01:21:22.156
Come right over here, Sergeant.

01:21:23.449 --> 01:21:27.408
You may not know it,
but you just got your life saved.

01:21:27.787 --> 01:21:29.747
You'll get a medal.

01:21:32.125 --> 01:21:35.244
Again the word came
and the Marines moved out.

01:21:35.585 --> 01:21:39.545
Again scuttlebutt knew a hundred
destinations, all wrong.

01:21:39.923 --> 01:21:43.964
This time we were a sound fighting unit,
blooded and trained.

01:21:44.345 --> 01:21:48.066
Tarawa had blooded us.
Stryker had trained us.

01:21:59.319 --> 01:22:03.840
- Now, I'll show you something.
- What you got there?

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:06.320
- What does it look like?
- A flag.

01:22:06.618 --> 01:22:11.577
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Occupy this island in the USA's name.

01:22:11.998 --> 01:22:16.036
- You think we'll have an easy time?
- You got me with you.

01:22:16.417 --> 01:22:21.018
- Maybe we need two of you.
- One was enough in Tarawa.

01:22:21.423 --> 01:22:24.983
Stick with me.
I'm a battle-hardened veteran.

01:22:25.344 --> 01:22:30.943
Know how many Japs I knocked off
in Tarawa? 32. Did I get anything for it?

01:22:31.390 --> 01:22:34.111
I got enemies in Washington.

01:22:34.435 --> 01:22:37.995
If the Marines didn't have me,
they'd never have made it.

01:22:38.355 --> 01:22:42.036
Now, this is how you fold a flag!

01:22:45.363 --> 01:22:48.122
Do you believe in intuition?

01:22:48.449 --> 01:22:51.968
Yeah... in women. Why?

01:22:52.328 --> 01:22:56.528
It's hard to explain. I've a feeling
I'm not coming out of this operation.

01:22:56.917 --> 01:22:59.356
Don't talk that way.

01:22:59.669 --> 01:23:03.068
- I can't help it. It's the way I feel.
- Why?

01:23:03.422 --> 01:23:07.823
I don't know. It's like a voice in my ear.
I can't shake the feeling off.

01:23:08.219 --> 01:23:10.779
Take my advice, shake it off.

01:23:11.098 --> 01:23:17.096
No dice. When things like that get in you,
it's no use trying to fight them.

01:23:24.776 --> 01:23:28.095
If a marine waits long enough
he gets the word.

01:23:28.445 --> 01:23:32.406
Our sealed orders came aboard
after five days at sea.

01:23:34.703 --> 01:23:37.501
This island is volcanic and sandy.

01:23:37.829 --> 01:23:42.190
It's five and a half miles long
and two and a half miles wide.

01:23:42.583 --> 01:23:47.424
This mountain here
is a dead volcano. It's called Suribachi.

01:23:47.838 --> 01:23:53.438
There's nothing on the island except
three airfields and about 20,000 Japs.

01:23:54.763 --> 01:23:59.884
The Army Air Corps B-24s have been
bombing this place for 62 days.

01:24:00.312 --> 01:24:04.671
- Maybe it'll be an easy operation then.
- We can't be sure.

01:24:05.065 --> 01:24:08.386
Every yard is covered
by some kind of fire.

01:24:08.736 --> 01:24:14.736
There are two possible landing beaches,
one on the east side, one on the west.

01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:18.519
The rest of the coastline is cliffs.

01:24:18.870 --> 01:24:20.911
They'll try and keep us off the beaches.

01:24:21.205 --> 01:24:25.085
If they don't, they'll try and catch us
at this first airfield,

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:30.459
between the heights of Suribachi
and these high rocky ridges in the north.

01:24:30.881 --> 01:24:36.721
They'll shell us from both sides. Nobody
knows what they've got on this island.

01:24:37.181 --> 01:24:40.180
But they've had 40 years to put it there.

01:24:43.809 --> 01:24:46.129
Saipan was our last stop.

01:24:46.436 --> 01:24:50.837
The men who were going to hit
the beach first transferred to LS Ts.

01:24:51.234 --> 01:24:55.315
A few more days at sea
and the time for landing came.

01:25:41.491 --> 01:25:42.931
Saddle up!

01:25:43.201 --> 01:25:46.161
Skip along and into the amtracs.

01:26:45.054 --> 01:26:48.092
Anyway, it's a good day for it.

01:26:48.431 --> 01:26:51.352
- It's cold.
- Stick around, it'll get warm.

01:26:51.684 --> 01:26:55.324
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.
Hey, look!

01:27:00.525 --> 01:27:05.286
- Driver, you the joker that wrote that?
- "Semper fi", Mac!

01:27:05.697 --> 01:27:08.657
We should take you in along with us.

01:27:10.746 --> 01:27:16.147
Hey, McHugh's going in with his pocket
full of books! Five books he's got!

01:27:16.584 --> 01:27:20.344
So? The kid's a reader.
That shouldn't worry a dope like you.

01:27:20.713 --> 01:27:25.914
When we're through with this operation,
I'm gonna break both your legs!

01:27:40.399 --> 01:27:45.479
- I feel sick.
- I know. I felt the same way at Tarawa.

01:27:45.903 --> 01:27:49.024
Hey, Stein, "Shalom aleychem".

01:27:49.365 --> 01:27:52.005
Aleychem shalom.

01:27:54.954 --> 01:27:58.515
- Sarge, I'm scared.
- So am I.

01:27:58.874 --> 01:28:03.595
- Not you!
- Fowler, I'm always scared.

01:28:04.004 --> 01:28:06.803
Line of departure! Get down!

01:28:07.133 --> 01:28:12.173
Lock and load! Drop those lifebelts
when we hit the beach!

01:28:59.934 --> 01:29:02.693
All right, hit the beach!

01:29:45.436 --> 01:29:47.318
It ain't Brooklyn!

01:29:47.606 --> 01:29:51.726
If this place was a blanket
I'd pull it over my head!

01:29:52.111 --> 01:29:57.110
This is the poorest soil I ever saw. What
does anyone want an island like this for?

01:29:57.533 --> 01:29:59.492
- That's war.
- What's war?

01:29:59.784 --> 01:30:01.904
Trading real estate for men.

01:30:02.201 --> 01:30:08.081
When God made the world, he must
have put all the rubbish left over here.

01:30:08.542 --> 01:30:11.502
Corpsman! Corpsman! Take it easy.

01:30:11.837 --> 01:30:16.596
Doggone it, almost the same place
they got me before!

01:30:18.427 --> 01:30:20.387
Getting shot for this!

01:30:21.636 --> 01:30:25.038
They're sure pouring it into Suribachi.

01:30:30.939 --> 01:30:35.699
Not enough. Those Nips
are shooting right down our throats.

01:30:36.110 --> 01:30:39.231
- Stryker!
- Yo!

01:30:42.117 --> 01:30:45.916
- Lieutenant Shrier wants to see you.
- Lieutenant Shrier?

01:30:47.705 --> 01:30:49.145
Stand fast.

01:31:02.386 --> 01:31:04.826
- Stryker reporting, sir.
- I know.

01:31:05.137 --> 01:31:09.297
Your platoon's been hit hard.
What's left has been assigned to me.

01:31:09.683 --> 01:31:13.604
- Yes, sir.
- Naval gunfire lifts at 1100. Stand by.

01:31:13.980 --> 01:31:15.260
Aye, aye.

01:31:37.629 --> 01:31:39.908
Move out!

01:31:40.215 --> 01:31:42.936
Keep your distance!

01:33:23.730 --> 01:33:28.490
- Go on, go on!
- Corpsman! Corpsman! Corpsman!

01:33:31.738 --> 01:33:34.498
Spread out! Dig in!

01:33:43.627 --> 01:33:48.386
- Dunne, where's my brother?
- Back there. He's hit.

01:33:52.343 --> 01:33:53.623
Flynn!

01:34:02.977 --> 01:34:05.537
That's enough!

01:34:11.027 --> 01:34:16.347
I told you you'd need this bad
some day. Thanks, Marine.

01:34:23.914 --> 01:34:25.874
Flynn! Get down!

01:34:28.877 --> 01:34:35.517
- You ain't got the sense of a rabbit!
- You can still be a hero crawling!

01:34:36.009 --> 01:34:40.690
- Corpsman!
- Ma'll dust me off if I don't get him back!

01:34:43.058 --> 01:34:45.058
Harris!

01:34:48.522 --> 01:34:52.442
Well, I'll get a good
night's sleep tonight.

01:34:52.818 --> 01:34:54.939
Corpsman!

01:34:55.238 --> 01:34:57.517
He won't need him.

01:35:13.421 --> 01:35:17.022
- Pillbox too big to handle with these.
- A bazooka?

01:35:17.383 --> 01:35:22.783
- If we had one.
- I got nothing to do. I'll go pick one up.

01:36:01.093 --> 01:36:03.093
Regazzi didn't make it.

01:36:03.387 --> 01:36:06.586
You never know what's happening.

01:36:06.932 --> 01:36:08.931
Listen.

01:36:11.185 --> 01:36:14.185
- It's a tank.
- Yeah, but whose?

01:36:17.066 --> 01:36:18.346
Ours!

01:36:40.422 --> 01:36:42.781
It's Regazzi.

01:37:03.737 --> 01:37:06.536
Pillbox at 2 o'clock.

01:37:11.620 --> 01:37:14.460
OK, give 'em a hot foot!

01:37:27.008 --> 01:37:28.968
Thanks, Mac.

01:37:35.015 --> 01:37:39.737
- I couldn't find a bazooka.
- You did all right. Saddle up!

01:38:13.554 --> 01:38:19.394
No one had ever seen anything like it.
No one would have believed it possible.

01:38:19.851 --> 01:38:22.851
That smoking, miserable, bloody island.

01:38:29.904 --> 01:38:33.903
After three days and three nights,
and at the end of that time,

01:38:34.283 --> 01:38:39.962
we'd barely reached the foot of
Suribachi, where we were the first day.

01:38:45.793 --> 01:38:49.154
- We'll sack here for the night.
- Best news today.

01:38:49.505 --> 01:38:54.064
Pair off and one man awake at all times.
Keep alert. Let's go.

01:39:05.396 --> 01:39:08.397
It'll start getting rough tomorrow
against Suribachi.

01:39:08.733 --> 01:39:13.133
It started getting rough
when you put on that uniform.

01:39:13.530 --> 01:39:16.730
You wanna see a good-looking kid?

01:39:18.241 --> 01:39:20.841
Husky little boot. What's his name?

01:39:21.161 --> 01:39:25.442
We're gonna name him Sam,
Sam Conway.

01:39:25.831 --> 01:39:30.792
A name that's been awarded the Navy
Cross is good enough for any kid.

01:39:31.212 --> 01:39:36.373
There's something I've been trying
to say but... I can't find the words.

01:39:36.802 --> 01:39:41.721
Two universities and you can't find
the words to say you were out of line?

01:39:42.140 --> 01:39:47.421
- OK, I'm out of line.
- No, you were. There's a difference.

01:39:50.689 --> 01:39:55.289
We'd better get some sack time.
Wanna sleep first or watch?

01:39:55.693 --> 01:39:58.253
- I'll watch.
- OK.

01:40:02.661 --> 01:40:06.861
Everybody gets out of line
once in a while.

01:40:08.917 --> 01:40:10.476
Thanks, gyrene.

01:40:13.836 --> 01:40:16.279
Where's Sergeant Stryker?

01:40:16.590 --> 01:40:19.270
- Stryker?
- Right there.

01:40:22.220 --> 01:40:26.020
- What do you want?
- Lieutenant Shrier wants to see you.

01:40:29.186 --> 01:40:31.145
- Stryker, sir.
- Yes, sir.

01:40:31.437 --> 01:40:33.678
I'm taking a patrol up Suribachi.

01:40:33.982 --> 01:40:37.263
Get your men squared away
and be ready at 0700.

01:40:37.610 --> 01:40:41.690
- The rendezvous is that Nip tank there.
- Aye, aye, sir, 0700.

01:40:51.665 --> 01:40:55.624
That little voice whispering
in your ear again?

01:40:56.002 --> 01:41:00.523
Don't worry. I've known
a million guys that have heard it.

01:41:00.924 --> 01:41:05.885
Most of them make it. A few don't.
The percentage is on your side.

01:41:06.306 --> 01:41:10.065
- Did you ever hear it?
- No.

01:41:10.434 --> 01:41:14.394
- Don't you ever worry about it?
- What good would it do?

01:41:14.772 --> 01:41:18.533
- You're indestructible.
- Stick close. It might rub off!

01:41:18.901 --> 01:41:20.501
I'll do that.

01:41:20.778 --> 01:41:26.937
Banner Three, this is Easy Five. Patrol is
ready to move. Request supporting fire.

01:43:00.081 --> 01:43:01.400
Ow!

01:43:40.787 --> 01:43:48.068
Sh'ma Yisrael, Adonai elohenu...
Adonai echad.

01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:51.840
Amen.

01:44:43.180 --> 01:44:45.220
Radio!

01:44:48.311 --> 01:44:51.592
Banner Three, this is Easy Five. Over.

01:44:51.940 --> 01:44:57.219
This is Easy Five. Cease fire,
we're preparing to move over the top.

01:44:59.697 --> 01:45:04.097
- Roger and out. Stryker!
- Yes, sir.

01:45:04.492 --> 01:45:08.654
Colonel's ordered that we put up this flag
when the top's secure. Get it there.

01:45:09.039 --> 01:45:11.200
Aye, aye, sir.

01:45:14.461 --> 01:45:16.461
What is this?

01:45:16.754 --> 01:45:20.195
Put yours away.
This is the one we're gonna use.

01:45:20.551 --> 01:45:26.073
First squad. Find something we can use
as a standard and we'll put this up.

01:45:33.148 --> 01:45:37.108
- Conway, you made it.
- I guess that little voice was wrong.

01:45:37.485 --> 01:45:40.365
- I feel better.
- I feel better, too.

01:45:40.695 --> 01:45:44.295
I never felt so good in my life.
How about a cigarette?

01:46:00.923 --> 01:46:03.402
- Is he...?
- Yeah.

01:46:03.718 --> 01:46:07.797
If he had to get it
it's the way he'd have wanted.

01:46:13.309 --> 01:46:16.150
It's a letter to his kid.

01:46:24.488 --> 01:46:30.129
"Dear son, I guess none of my letters
have reached you."

01:46:30.578 --> 01:46:33.259
"I thought I'd try again as I'm feeling"

01:46:33.580 --> 01:46:38.581
"that this may be the last
time I can write you."

01:46:39.877 --> 01:46:43.557
"For a long time
I've wanted to tell you many things."

01:46:43.925 --> 01:46:46.205
"Now that you're a big boy, I will."

01:46:47.386 --> 01:46:50.186
"If we'd been together even for a while,"

01:46:50.512 --> 01:46:56.112
"I could've explained many things
much better than writing them."

01:46:56.561 --> 01:47:02.281
"You've gotta take care of your mother,
and love her and make her happy."

01:47:02.732 --> 01:47:05.733
"Never hurt her or anyone as I did."

01:47:08.071 --> 01:47:11.271
"Always do what your heart
tells you is right."

01:47:11.617 --> 01:47:16.777
"Maybe someone will write you some day
and tell you about me."

01:47:17.204 --> 01:47:23.286
"I want you to be like me in some
things, but not like me in others."

01:47:23.753 --> 01:47:29.194
"When you grow older and get to know
more about me, you'll see I've failed..."

01:47:30.928 --> 01:47:33.408
"...in many ways."

01:47:33.724 --> 01:47:38.483
"This isn't what I wanted
but things just turned out that way."

01:47:38.894 --> 01:47:42.015
"If there was only more time I..."

01:47:46.026 --> 01:47:48.347
Guess he never finished it.

01:47:57.161 --> 01:48:00.280
I'll finish it for him.

01:48:08.922 --> 01:48:11.322
There she goes.

01:49:05.978 --> 01:49:09.418
All right, saddle up!
Let's get back in the war!
