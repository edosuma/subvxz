00:56.656 --> 00:59.557
Sometimes, life is so perfect.

00:59.626 --> 01:01.218
Isn't it?

01:01.294 --> 01:04.888
It has to be. To make up for all
the hard stuff it throws your way.

01:08.501 --> 01:10.162
You have to learn to walk.

01:11.204 --> 01:12.865
You have to learn to talk.

01:15.041 --> 01:16.099
You have to wear

01:16.176 --> 01:19.339
that totally ridiculous hat
your grandma bought you.

01:20.313 --> 01:22.804
You have no say in the matter.

01:23.450 --> 01:26.783
And when you're a little older,
even though you get to choose your hats,

01:26.853 --> 01:30.345
you don't get to choose what they put
in those meatballs at the cafeteria.

01:31.257 --> 01:32.747
Or when to fall in love.

01:37.130 --> 01:40.998
Things happen,
and you just have to deal.

01:46.172 --> 01:48.333
And breathe.

01:50.643 --> 01:53.544
Let's just think of the day
my parent's divorce came through

01:53.613 --> 01:56.605
as "Big, Ugly Hat Day."

01:58.251 --> 02:01.186
Refer to diagram B
on page 19.

02:02.021 --> 02:04.012
"The Tree of Life."

02:04.891 --> 02:06.518
And breathe.

02:06.593 --> 02:10.824
...anybody but his own
selfish pleasure.

02:10.896 --> 02:12.592
- Mom, please.
- Focus.

02:12.665 --> 02:16.692
I couldn't care less about
your father's midlife crisis

02:16.769 --> 02:19.602
and complete mockery
of his wedding vows.

02:21.107 --> 02:23.371
I just hope he doesn't
expect me to take...

02:23.443 --> 02:25.707
Halley, I'm sorry.
I didn't see you there.

02:25.778 --> 02:27.939
- Guys...
- Where do you think you're going?

02:28.014 --> 02:31.211
As long as you're gonna kill me
with flying ice, does it matter?

02:31.284 --> 02:32.751
Excuse me, everyone. L...

02:32.819 --> 02:33.979
- Mom?
- Sorry.

02:34.053 --> 02:36.851
I have some really
important news to announce here.

02:36.923 --> 02:39.915
Lewis and l...
we're getting married.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.325
He asked me last Saturday night.

02:42.395 --> 02:43.555
I wanted to tell you,

02:43.630 --> 02:47.088
but I wasn't sure when,
or how you'd react.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.830
I told him I couldn't even wear
this ring until after I talked to you.

02:50.904 --> 02:53.964
But we wanna have
this big Spring wedding.

02:54.040 --> 02:55.530
Mom, I'm so happy.

03:06.486 --> 03:07.817
Nice timing, huh?

03:08.988 --> 03:12.480
Tell your mom you're getting married
on the day she gets divorced.

03:12.559 --> 03:14.891
Why does love
make people crazy?

03:26.739 --> 03:29.902
Scarlett, you weren't picking up
your phone. I'm so sorry.

03:32.912 --> 03:35.403
Halley, that's Michael. Michael...

03:36.849 --> 03:37.838
Hi.

03:39.752 --> 03:40.741
Thank you.

03:45.491 --> 03:47.982
Bye! I love you!

03:49.796 --> 03:50.854
What do you think?

03:54.100 --> 03:56.625
You didn't tell me
you were doing it.

03:59.339 --> 04:03.298
When you meet the right person
and you fall in love...

04:05.778 --> 04:09.441
It's like... it's like
everything you thought...

04:09.515 --> 04:11.346
you thought is...

04:12.485 --> 04:13.645
Can you believe it?

04:13.720 --> 04:15.654
No. I can't.

04:15.722 --> 04:17.656
Scarlett, come on.

04:17.724 --> 04:22.320
You are sounding dangerously close
to a Hallmark greeting card.

04:22.395 --> 04:26.161
You're gonna let yourself turn
into mush over something like sex?

04:28.167 --> 04:29.156
Yeah.

04:29.936 --> 04:32.427
You can't expect
to do anything great in life

04:32.505 --> 04:36.236
if you buckle the first time
some guy bats his eyes at you.

04:36.309 --> 04:37.901
News flash, Hal.

04:37.977 --> 04:40.707
Even Madonna
eventually got married.

04:41.614 --> 04:45.414
My mom thinks that means
there's hope for her, too.

04:48.054 --> 04:49.919
Your mom wants to get married?

04:51.157 --> 04:53.489
Well, she wants
to fall in love, Halley.

04:55.094 --> 04:56.425
Everyone does.

04:56.496 --> 04:58.987
Hi. I've been in...

05:00.400 --> 05:03.164
Hi. I've been divorced
for a long time,

05:03.236 --> 05:06.171
so my baggage is ancient history.

05:06.673 --> 05:10.302
I like to think
that I travel light these days.

05:10.376 --> 05:14.710
Except for my daughter, Scarlett,
who is just a joy of a carryon.

05:16.816 --> 05:19.307
I think I'm taking
the baggage thing too far.

05:22.288 --> 05:23.619
Maybe I should start over.

05:23.690 --> 05:25.851
You know what I think
of this whole idea.

05:25.925 --> 05:28.155
I'm only gonna send it
to the online guys

05:28.227 --> 05:33.062
who pass my rigid
five-point checklist.

05:33.132 --> 05:34.531
Here, you try.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.090
- Go away.
- Lydia.

05:36.169 --> 05:39.764
The man of your dreams
is sitting out there right now

05:39.839 --> 05:41.636
waiting to hear from you.

05:41.708 --> 05:42.697
Speak to him.

05:42.775 --> 05:46.108
I don't think the perfect man
is gonna want to hear what I have to say.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.374
Sure he does, Sweetie.
Speak to him.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.338
Go on.

05:54.487 --> 05:56.421
I'm sorry, Mr. Perfect...

05:56.489 --> 06:00.391
but if you're waiting for me,
it's gonna be a hell of a long wait.

06:00.460 --> 06:04.123
See, I've had it
with men like you.

06:05.131 --> 06:07.759
I think it's terrific
that you have a great job,

06:07.834 --> 06:10.462
and you're sensitive
to the needs of others,

06:10.536 --> 06:14.768
and you jog three times a week
to keep the belly at bay.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.900
But the second
some silicon-breasted,

06:17.977 --> 06:21.003
butt-kissing, airhead climber
half your age comes along,

06:21.080 --> 06:22.980
you can't keep
your pants zipped.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.107
Well, fuck you!

06:24.183 --> 06:25.946
That's right, Mr. Middle-age,

06:26.018 --> 06:28.418
think-you're-a-big-shot,
phony asshole.

06:28.488 --> 06:30.649
You ain't gettin' any from me.

06:33.192 --> 06:34.181
Okay.

06:34.927 --> 06:37.088
I think we'll just
give this a little time.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.394
So juvenile.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.243
I'm glad you're back early from camp,

06:54.313 --> 06:56.508
even though it was
a dishonorable discharge.

06:56.582 --> 06:59.415
What happened? Where were
you trying to get to in that canoe?

06:59.485 --> 07:00.474
No comment.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.109
No comment?

07:02.955 --> 07:04.616
I don't speak to the press.

07:05.124 --> 07:06.216
I'm the press?

07:06.292 --> 07:10.251
Yeah, and anything I say can
and will be used against me, right?

07:10.329 --> 07:12.388
I would never use
anything against you.

07:12.465 --> 07:16.697
Dad, give it up! It's old,
and you need to get your own material.

07:16.769 --> 07:18.703
- Daddy Dog.
- Yo.

07:18.771 --> 07:23.231
Len Martin. It's you, right?
WDYG's coolest DJ.

07:23.309 --> 07:24.298
That's me.

07:24.977 --> 07:26.308
"We dig the dog!"

07:27.513 --> 07:29.504
- Love your show, man.
- Thanks, man.

07:30.783 --> 07:34.184
You are the hippest
old guy I know.

07:34.253 --> 07:36.949
Yo, dude!
I'm not that old!

07:43.095 --> 07:44.585
That's Len Martin.

07:49.402 --> 07:51.393
Hello, gorgeous ones.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.598
And you invited her.

07:53.673 --> 07:56.233
- Hey, Baby.
- Hey.

07:56.309 --> 07:59.801
I thought we'd spend time together,
then we could have a chance to bond.

08:04.050 --> 08:07.542
Well... look at you, Halley.

08:08.087 --> 08:10.578
That's hard to do
without a mirror, isn't it?

08:12.458 --> 08:15.291
Honey, you keep getting
prettier every day.

08:15.361 --> 08:18.057
I have no idea how you
could say that, cause...

08:18.130 --> 08:20.928
you definitely don't
see me every day, do you?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.730
And yesterday,
oh, my God, I was so ugly,

08:23.803 --> 08:25.862
and last Wednesday...
that sucked, too.

08:25.938 --> 08:28.600
So it's kind of
a day to day thing.

08:30.810 --> 08:32.471
I love that sense of humor.

08:33.746 --> 08:36.909
Just like her daddy.

08:38.583 --> 08:41.144
- Look at that gorgeous girl.
- Dad, stop it.

08:41.220 --> 08:42.881
She's got her daddy's hair.

08:43.556 --> 08:45.547
- Don't cut it.
- It's beautiful.

08:45.625 --> 08:47.991
Don't cut it.
Just let it grow, let it grow.

08:48.060 --> 08:49.391
Don't cut it.

08:49.462 --> 08:50.451
Cut it.

08:51.264 --> 08:52.253
Okay.

08:57.303 --> 09:01.399
Let me count the ways
that this card can be used to induce...

09:01.474 --> 09:04.568
nausea,
gastric distress, vomiting.

09:05.444 --> 09:07.810
Yeah, go ahead and mock me,
but this is serious.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.849
I need to find something funny
and something sweet...

09:10.917 --> 09:12.248
just the way Scarlett is.

09:12.318 --> 09:15.481
- Remember last time I got her...
- Okay. Look, here's one.

09:15.555 --> 09:16.613
Not helping.

09:16.689 --> 09:19.180
"From small beginnings
come great things."

09:21.861 --> 09:23.852
"Congratulations
on your new baby."

09:24.263 --> 09:25.958
I thought you
were gonna help.

09:26.032 --> 09:27.363
Lighten up, Sherwood.

09:28.267 --> 09:30.633
"The first time we met,
you stole my heart."

09:33.139 --> 09:36.575
"Good luck in finding
a compatible organ donor." Nice.

09:37.276 --> 09:39.267
I'm kidding, okay?
It's blank inside.

09:39.345 --> 09:41.506
You know something?
You're not too funny.

09:42.381 --> 09:44.713
This girl is amazing...
unlike you...

09:44.784 --> 09:47.014
and she's sensitive...
unlike you.

09:47.687 --> 09:49.245
And she's sexy.

09:49.322 --> 09:50.687
Unlike you.

09:50.756 --> 09:53.054
- There's gotta be a card...
- Is that Michael?

09:53.125 --> 09:55.184
...for a redhead from...
- I can't see.

09:55.261 --> 09:58.162
...a newly smitten
hunka hunka burning love.

09:58.230 --> 10:00.221
I mean... look.

10:00.967 --> 10:03.128
Summer romance
has its own section.

10:04.136 --> 10:06.661
It's not a summer romance. I mean...

10:06.739 --> 10:10.334
- Scarlett is...
- Standing right behind you, dude.

10:13.079 --> 10:14.068
Hi.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.040
Sneaking up on me?

10:20.553 --> 10:23.044
- Hi, Halley.
- Hi.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.192
You remember my name?

10:28.260 --> 10:30.228
Sure. We were in Biology together.

10:30.963 --> 10:32.692
Yeah, I know, but...

10:32.765 --> 10:35.461
well, you were never there,
really... technically.

10:37.203 --> 10:38.363
I like your hair.

10:39.672 --> 10:40.661
Thank you.

10:59.992 --> 11:02.722
See, my schedule is all wrong,
which I think is a sign

11:02.795 --> 11:05.525
that nothing's going
according to plan this year.

11:06.632 --> 11:09.396
It's a complete and total mess.

11:10.302 --> 11:12.202
Looks like a fine schedule to me.

11:12.271 --> 11:16.640
No. Band?
I would never sign up for band.

11:16.709 --> 11:19.507
- What's wrong with band?
- I don't play anything.

11:19.578 --> 11:22.240
Well, maybe you should.
I'm sure you can handle it.

11:23.482 --> 11:25.712
Mrs. Toussaint,
this is not my schedule.

11:25.785 --> 11:29.221
Look, I'm signed up for Algebra,
and I've already taken Calculus.

11:29.288 --> 11:33.486
Maybe a brush-up is a good thing,
not to mention a good grade.

11:33.559 --> 11:36.756
Why don't you just give it a shot
before you decide anything?

11:36.829 --> 11:40.128
Okay, I'm signed up for boys' P.E.

11:40.199 --> 11:43.293
- 94 FM
- Fill out this form.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.132
- Daddy Dog.
- We'll start again.

11:45.204 --> 11:49.334
Len Martin with a traffic update
from that love puppy in the skies,

11:49.408 --> 11:51.740
our very own Lorna Queen.

11:51.811 --> 11:53.472
Lorna, you up there?

11:53.546 --> 11:54.604
Hi, Len.

11:54.680 --> 11:57.649
On a clear day,
you can see forever,

11:57.717 --> 12:00.311
and this is one beautiful morning.

12:00.986 --> 12:03.284
Should we tell everyone
our little secret?

12:03.355 --> 12:05.949
Careful. Baby,
you sure this is the time?

12:06.625 --> 12:11.255
I am bursting at the seams
to tell everyone we're eloping.

12:13.599 --> 12:15.430
I just spilled the beans.

12:21.540 --> 12:23.735
That is your father's show, right?

12:23.809 --> 12:24.969
I just love it.

12:27.246 --> 12:28.235
Hi.

12:29.915 --> 12:32.577
Tell him congratulations.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.714
I'm sure you're very excited
about the upcoming nuptials.

12:39.358 --> 12:41.189
My father and my sister.

12:42.294 --> 12:44.228
My sister and my father?

12:44.296 --> 12:47.197
Your father and your sister
are getting married?

12:47.266 --> 12:48.255
Yeah.

12:48.968 --> 12:51.459
No, not to each other.

12:52.071 --> 12:53.060
I...

12:54.807 --> 12:57.469
I have to check something
before I fill this out.

13:00.379 --> 13:02.870
Sit down, Forrester.

13:03.816 --> 13:06.979
Let's see if we can
sort out your usual chaos.

13:07.052 --> 13:10.044
Maybe you'll even do us
the honor of attending this year.

13:10.122 --> 13:12.716
Okay, later, M.T.
I gotta rethink that shop class.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.692
I'm pretty scary with tools.

13:18.063 --> 13:19.052
Oh, my.

13:19.832 --> 13:22.232
You didn't know
about your dad getting married?

13:22.301 --> 13:23.290
Yes, I did.

13:24.270 --> 13:27.137
The bastard tells
the whole world before he tells you.

13:27.206 --> 13:28.366
He's not...

13:30.276 --> 13:31.265
Whatever.

13:32.878 --> 13:36.211
At least if they're eloping,
you won't have to go the wedding.

13:36.282 --> 13:37.772
Weddings are the worst.

13:39.218 --> 13:42.813
Me? I've had to go to,
like, five between my parents.

13:43.322 --> 13:44.311
Don't ask.

13:47.293 --> 13:50.956
Listen, M.T. Wasn't giving you
a hard time back there, was she?

13:51.964 --> 13:52.953
"M.T."?

13:53.032 --> 13:56.365
Mrs. Toussaint and l...
we're on close terms.

13:56.435 --> 13:59.199
You get to know
your guidance counselor really well

13:59.271 --> 14:02.604
when you're clearly
in desperate need of guidance.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.905
See, I've got it
down to a science.

14:05.544 --> 14:07.307
You try the Jedi mind trick.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.847
- What's that?
- You never saw Star Wars?

14:11.917 --> 14:15.819
No, I saw it. I guess I just
didn't memorize it like you did.

14:15.888 --> 14:17.719
Well, that's your loss, isn't it?

14:17.790 --> 14:21.351
Because the Jedi mind trick
is when you tell someone what to think,

14:21.427 --> 14:22.485
and they think it.

14:22.561 --> 14:24.961
For example, M.T. Says,

14:25.030 --> 14:28.761
"Macon, you're already in trouble,
and it's the first day of school.

14:28.834 --> 14:30.995
Is this any way
to start the new year?"

14:31.704 --> 14:33.831
Pretend you're me.
Now what do you say?

14:34.373 --> 14:36.204
Okay. I say...

14:37.710 --> 14:40.042
No. I wanna be someone else.

14:40.779 --> 14:43.441
Cute. No. You as me say...

14:46.051 --> 14:49.953
Mrs. T, you're gonna
let this one slide

14:50.022 --> 14:52.286
because it was
an honest mistake,

14:52.358 --> 14:54.883
it's only the first day of school,

14:54.960 --> 14:57.861
and the fire was put out
as quickly as it was started.

14:59.198 --> 15:01.564
You didn't really
start a fire, did you?

15:03.903 --> 15:06.929
The point is that you put
the words into somebody's mouth

15:07.006 --> 15:09.907
and they give them back
like they've come up with the idea.

15:09.975 --> 15:12.170
Like when I ask you
to go out this Friday night,

15:12.244 --> 15:15.145
you're gonna think you're
asking me because you're gonna say,

15:15.214 --> 15:16.704
"I would love to go out with you

15:16.782 --> 15:19.376
"because I know
we'll have a great time together.

15:19.451 --> 15:22.978
In fact, I've been hoping
you'd ask me all week."

15:24.723 --> 15:26.782
You wanna go out
on a date with me?

15:26.859 --> 15:28.918
See? I told you you'd ask me.

15:29.862 --> 15:33.798
Macon, I think I like you too much
already to actually go out with you.

15:35.401 --> 15:37.198
What kind of logic is that?

15:39.905 --> 15:41.600
It's logical logic.

15:42.308 --> 15:44.833
The quickest way to ruin
a relationship with someone

15:44.910 --> 15:47.606
is to actually try
to have a relationship with them.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.649
Haven't you noticed when
the opposite sex gets together,

15:50.716 --> 15:52.946
eventually someone
ends up getting hurt?

15:55.287 --> 15:57.517
I am, too... boycotting.

15:57.589 --> 15:59.955
You can't boycott
your father's wedding.

16:00.025 --> 16:03.722
It's not even a wedding.
It's... an elopement.

16:03.796 --> 16:07.630
Yeah, except everyone within
his radio frequency is invited.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.361
My God.
He is such a hypocrite.

16:09.435 --> 16:12.063
I cannot believe he wouldn't
tell us about it first.

16:12.137 --> 16:14.503
He didn't give any warning
when you went dinner?

16:14.573 --> 16:16.404
- None.
- She was at that dinner?

16:16.909 --> 16:17.898
No.

16:21.113 --> 16:23.513
Okay, yeah.
She was there at the end.

16:23.582 --> 16:26.779
Mom, come on. She wasn't
even supposed to be there.

16:26.852 --> 16:30.185
You know, I don't think I'm gonna
let him walk me down the aisle.

16:30.990 --> 16:34.255
Please stop worrying about me.
I am fine. I'm fine.

16:34.326 --> 16:37.693
In a way, it sets me free.
I feel strangely liberated.

16:38.297 --> 16:40.356
And he is still
your father, after all,

16:40.432 --> 16:44.391
and if he wants to make
a complete and utter fool of himself

16:44.470 --> 16:48.668
by trying in some
pathetically cliché fashion

16:48.741 --> 16:51.972
to recapture
his sorry state of manhood,

16:52.044 --> 16:55.013
by hooking up with not even
a very attractive bimbo...

16:55.080 --> 16:58.538
then if that's what he wants,
I'm fine with that.

16:59.585 --> 17:00.813
Someone toss, please.

17:03.489 --> 17:04.478
Now.

17:07.291 --> 17:08.953
This is our reception area.

17:09.828 --> 17:12.955
With out post-ceremony
champagne bar...

17:14.165 --> 17:19.001
which is conveniently located
right next to our very own chapel.

17:22.340 --> 17:24.502
Can't you picture
walking down this aisle?

17:24.576 --> 17:25.804
In a coffin.

17:27.079 --> 17:29.912
Sorry, it's just...
a little depressing.

17:29.982 --> 17:32.348
Actually, nobody's ever
said that before.

17:32.418 --> 17:35.478
Lewis... say something.
What do you think?

17:35.554 --> 17:38.887
Well, I like it.
It's very clean.

17:39.258 --> 17:40.247
Clean?

17:40.993 --> 17:43.689
Is that what you want
our wedding day to be? Clean?

17:44.296 --> 17:45.991
It's not... it's not pretty,

17:46.065 --> 17:48.659
it's not intimate,
it's not romantic.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.396
I'm just so happy
that I get to marry you.

17:51.470 --> 17:53.335
I'm sorry, not to pressure you,

17:53.405 --> 17:55.873
but this space does
book up quickly for Spring.

17:55.941 --> 17:57.238
We have another couple...

17:57.309 --> 17:59.402
Why don't we
give them a moment to think.

18:00.212 --> 18:03.511
Ashley, Sweetie,
they plan the whole thing.

18:03.582 --> 18:07.541
The food, the flowers...
even the place cards.

18:09.688 --> 18:12.020
Think about how much
less hassle it'll be.

18:13.225 --> 18:16.820
You think planning the most
important day of our lives is a hassle?

18:17.830 --> 18:19.889
It hasn't even been that long.

18:20.466 --> 18:21.956
19 1/2 hours.

18:23.402 --> 18:25.734
Wouldn't Michael
look cool in that?

18:27.573 --> 18:29.063
Hey, I did a good job.

18:30.409 --> 18:32.900
Michael Sherwood would
look good in anything.

18:32.978 --> 18:34.946
That's not the point,
though, okay?

18:35.013 --> 18:37.675
Enjoy him,
and fool around with him.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.978
Don't fall in love with him.

18:40.052 --> 18:42.714
Why do you think
they call it "falling," anyways?

18:43.322 --> 18:45.688
It's not worth it to you
to spend on a wedding.

18:45.757 --> 18:47.247
It's the most important day.

18:47.326 --> 18:49.624
I was trying to kill
two birds with one stone.

18:49.695 --> 18:51.060
Cheap is what that is.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.655
You see cheap,
I see convenience.

18:53.732 --> 18:55.222
Look at them.

18:55.300 --> 18:58.269
They're like a walking
warning sign against romance.

18:58.337 --> 19:02.501
Lewis is this anal, uptight geek
who has my sister under some spell.

19:02.574 --> 19:05.566
Now all this formerly
semi-intelligent person thinks about

19:05.644 --> 19:09.239
is diamonds and hairdos and bullshit.

19:09.314 --> 19:10.303
It's like K-Mart.

19:10.382 --> 19:12.543
How am I supposed
to know what it looks like?

19:12.618 --> 19:15.416
Maybe go by and look
at it? Or maybe...

19:15.487 --> 19:17.387
See? They don't
even like each other.

19:17.456 --> 19:21.825
But this stupid spell they're under
makes them disregard all the facts.

19:22.361 --> 19:26.195
They are fighting because they
love each other enough to care.

19:26.265 --> 19:29.325
I didn't know it looked
like a K-Mart before I went there.

19:29.401 --> 19:32.564
- Once we got in there, you knew.
- I made a mistake.

19:32.638 --> 19:35.471
Too bad you can't get
a divorce before getting married.

19:35.541 --> 19:38.601
You could save yourself
in that stupid extra step.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.271
- I'm sorry.
- See?

19:44.516 --> 19:47.679
- What are you looking for?
- These dishes, they're perfect.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.052
That's love, Halley.

19:52.491 --> 19:56.325
Okay, fall once and you may never
be able to get back up again.

20:04.269 --> 20:05.793
Geek!
Get out of here.

20:14.379 --> 20:15.869
Isn't he adorable?

20:16.748 --> 20:17.737
He's cute.

20:34.266 --> 20:35.756
All right, Michael!

20:36.902 --> 20:38.563
Way to get that goal!

20:46.979 --> 20:48.469
Okay, guys, line up!

21:10.269 --> 21:12.430
Okay, back up.
Let's give him some air.

21:13.171 --> 21:16.004
Sherwood? You hear me?

21:29.988 --> 21:32.786
Guys, back up.
Give him some air, all right?

21:34.793 --> 21:35.782
Call the doctor.

21:43.802 --> 21:47.636
I thought my parents' divorce
was the end of the world.

21:49.074 --> 21:51.907
That was before
Michael died of a heart defect.

21:53.345 --> 21:54.676
And the world stopped.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.805
Or it should have.

22:20.405 --> 22:21.736
I'm sorry.

22:33.552 --> 22:34.712
What do you think?

22:35.954 --> 22:38.013
I think it's 100 degrees out.

22:42.227 --> 22:44.058
What am I supposed to do?

22:44.796 --> 22:47.526
The only black clothes
I have are winter clothes.

22:48.367 --> 22:49.857
I have nothing nice to wear.

22:49.935 --> 22:52.062
I don't think it matters, really.

22:52.137 --> 22:56.130
Look, this is... this is
dark green and it's really nice.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.869
It's ugly, Halley.

23:01.346 --> 23:03.837
I'm just trying to think
about something else.

23:05.250 --> 23:07.343
Anything, for one single second.

23:22.200 --> 23:23.861
I wanna look good for him.

23:26.304 --> 23:27.965
Does that sound crazy?

23:29.241 --> 23:30.572
This was a bad idea.

23:31.243 --> 23:35.270
Yeah, but dying is definitely
not one of the better concepts.

23:35.781 --> 23:39.080
No, the dress. Everyone's
looking at me like I'm a freak.

23:39.151 --> 23:41.551
Okay, it's not for them.
It's for Michael.

23:42.721 --> 23:43.881
Remember that.

23:45.624 --> 23:47.785
Can you believe
what she's wearing?

23:47.859 --> 23:49.986
That's, like, so disrespectful.

23:50.061 --> 23:52.723
She always has to have
all the attention to herself.

23:55.033 --> 23:57.593
"Although it droop
and die that night,

23:57.669 --> 24:01.662
it was the plant
and flower of light.

24:02.841 --> 24:06.333
In small proportions,
we just beauty see.

24:07.679 --> 24:09.738
And in short measures,

24:09.815 --> 24:13.410
life may perfect be.

24:16.788 --> 24:20.121
Mr. Macon Forrester
will now address us.

24:40.145 --> 24:42.136
I was gonna read from this...

24:46.651 --> 24:48.482
but I'm not very good at reading.

24:50.889 --> 24:52.914
Or writing...

24:52.991 --> 24:54.322
or spelling.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.492
Not like Michael.

24:58.864 --> 25:01.697
He was good at so many things
without even trying.

25:03.602 --> 25:05.365
He taught me how to be myself.

25:07.038 --> 25:08.198
By myself.

25:11.042 --> 25:13.374
Not to worry
about what other people think.

25:15.847 --> 25:18.338
Even if that means
being completely uncool.

25:21.319 --> 25:24.982
He taught me about
how to trust people.

25:28.827 --> 25:30.158
And how to love.

25:32.197 --> 25:33.528
'Cause he was so good.

25:33.598 --> 25:36.431
He loved his family,
he loved his friends.

25:36.501 --> 25:38.162
He loved basketball.

25:40.038 --> 25:41.528
And he loved Scarlett.

25:46.044 --> 25:47.534
And he loved this.

27:08.893 --> 27:12.192
Take this woman, Lorna Queen,
to be your lawful wedded wife,

27:12.263 --> 27:15.164
your partner, the queen
of your heart, forever and ever?

27:15.233 --> 27:16.291
Oh, yeah!

27:16.368 --> 27:18.199
Daddy, rock on
with your woman!

27:20.505 --> 27:22.666
And do you,
Lorna P. Queen,

27:22.741 --> 27:25.642
take this old guy Len to be
your lawfully wedded husband

27:25.710 --> 27:27.803
for all the rest of your days?

27:27.879 --> 27:28.868
I do.

27:33.151 --> 27:35.415
Wrap it up.
We're off in 15 seconds. Go.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.819
Our airtime is almost up.

27:39.257 --> 27:42.590
We must now go
where Federal regulations

27:42.661 --> 27:46.961
will not allow you to follow,
if you know what I mean.

27:49.834 --> 27:51.495
Lewis, no barking.

28:04.983 --> 28:07.975
Sorry, but you gotta go.

28:10.221 --> 28:11.381
Poor little thing.

28:12.891 --> 28:14.552
I know just how it feels.

28:15.694 --> 28:18.527
Out with the old,
in with the new.

28:21.032 --> 28:22.522
And who do you think you are?

28:23.268 --> 28:25.429
Just because
you've got great petals.

28:28.173 --> 28:30.505
Oh, my God.
I'm talking to my plants.

28:31.443 --> 28:32.603
Oh, my God.

28:33.611 --> 28:35.340
You're talking to your plants.

28:37.582 --> 28:38.742
How was it?

28:39.551 --> 28:41.143
It was great...

28:41.219 --> 28:44.382
if you happen to be the Devil
and enjoy human pain.

28:44.889 --> 28:46.117
Tell me something.

28:47.025 --> 28:49.619
I don't know!
What do you want me to tell you?

28:49.694 --> 28:52.492
Wait! No, the bimbo
almost died of strangulation.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.555
I cannot believe I forgot to tell you.

28:54.632 --> 28:57.658
Her wedding veil took on
a life of its own and rebelled,

28:57.736 --> 28:59.363
and she had to claw
her way out.

28:59.437 --> 29:01.632
And you know
that woman can claw.

29:01.706 --> 29:03.731
It was so sad.
It was like...

29:03.808 --> 29:06.038
near death by wedding veil.

29:07.512 --> 29:09.412
Just tragic, isn't it?

29:09.481 --> 29:11.506
Oh, my God!
And their vows?

29:12.150 --> 29:14.983
Was Dad that much a loser
when you guys got married?

29:17.122 --> 29:18.282
I'm sorry.

29:24.496 --> 29:25.986
Your father's not a loser.

29:28.767 --> 29:31.998
Although he did choose
to look like one at our wedding, too.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.433
He insisted on wearing
a powder-blue tuxedo.

29:45.383 --> 29:47.874
Then why do people
get married, anyways?

29:47.952 --> 29:49.852
We know
they're lying to each other,

29:49.921 --> 29:51.912
but are they lying
to themselves, too?

29:53.491 --> 29:56.654
How can you promise you're
gonna feel the same way forever?

30:01.866 --> 30:04.198
Things do
sometimes change, Halley.

30:08.740 --> 30:13.234
This house is awfully big for just
the two of us, don't you think?

30:15.146 --> 30:17.478
- What?
- You'll be going to college soon.

30:17.549 --> 30:20.643
Mom... a year and 3/4
is not really that soon.

30:20.718 --> 30:23.050
I want to start thinking
about streamlining.

30:23.121 --> 30:24.850
Maybe we should
sell the house.

30:26.524 --> 30:28.424
I grew up in this house.

30:28.493 --> 30:31.587
Yes, and there have been
some great memories in this house.

30:31.663 --> 30:32.823
This is my house.

30:32.897 --> 30:36.298
I understand how you
must feel, but life changes.

30:36.367 --> 30:38.892
This is ridiculous, Mom!
Come on!

30:43.641 --> 30:46.872
And I don't want to live here alone.

31:03.294 --> 31:04.625
I have to give him a ride.

31:10.535 --> 31:12.127
Bye, Halley.

31:16.140 --> 31:18.108
Stand back!
Leaf man to the rescue.

31:19.577 --> 31:21.135
Where did you get that?

31:21.212 --> 31:24.545
A guy's gotta pay for gas
and bacon burgers somehow, right?

31:24.616 --> 31:26.106
And toys, 'cause I imagine

31:26.184 --> 31:28.846
Star Wars figurines
must get pretty expensive.

31:28.920 --> 31:31.252
I do not have
any Star Wars figurines.

31:32.023 --> 31:35.857
Not many,
and I don't play with them... much.

31:36.561 --> 31:37.789
This one's on the house.

31:39.931 --> 31:40.920
Okay.

31:42.634 --> 31:43.623
Here you go.

31:47.906 --> 31:50.898
You're afraid to go out with me
because you might like me?

31:50.975 --> 31:54.035
No, but that's
a good theory, I guess,

31:54.112 --> 31:56.842
if you want to protect
your fragile male ego.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.883
'Cause you can't handle rejection.

31:58.950 --> 32:00.645
Rejection? Whatever!

33:20.198 --> 33:23.497
Of course you think it's weird
that I didn't just use the phone,

33:23.568 --> 33:26.969
but you're also glad because
it's much better to talk in person.

33:27.038 --> 33:30.030
Especially when I've come
with such a specific purpose.

33:31.209 --> 33:33.541
Which is why you're
gonna cut me some slack.

33:36.147 --> 33:38.138
You are absolutely crazy.

33:38.216 --> 33:39.547
I've been called worse.

33:41.252 --> 33:42.879
You're gonna kiss me, Halley.

33:45.156 --> 33:47.147
You're gonna come a little closer...

33:53.498 --> 33:55.489
so I can put
my arms around you.

33:57.201 --> 33:59.101
And on the count of three...

34:00.772 --> 34:01.761
two...

34:02.940 --> 34:03.929
one.

34:17.455 --> 34:19.047
You're a really good kisser.

34:21.159 --> 34:22.319
You tricked me.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.889
You Jedi mind-tricked me.

34:31.135 --> 34:32.795
Halley, is that you out there?

34:32.870 --> 34:35.737
Close your eyes. Go to bed.

34:35.806 --> 34:38.139
- Give me a break.
- Who are you talking to?

34:42.246 --> 34:43.577
I'm sorry, I...

34:43.648 --> 34:44.706
Sorry.

34:45.616 --> 34:48.346
I just... I needed to talk.

34:50.021 --> 34:53.684
I was just coming over
for a little late-night chat.

34:55.126 --> 34:57.356
We're not gonna
stay up very late, okay?

34:58.229 --> 34:59.628
At least do it inside.

35:04.535 --> 35:05.695
"Nausea"?

35:07.171 --> 35:08.160
A little.

35:09.540 --> 35:11.303
"Breast tenderness"?

35:15.780 --> 35:16.940
Yeah. Major.

35:17.748 --> 35:19.079
"Food cravings"?

35:27.291 --> 35:28.451
Grapefruit.

35:28.893 --> 35:32.454
Come on, I could answer "yes"
to most of these questions, too.

35:33.631 --> 35:35.121
I used to hate grapefruit.

35:39.403 --> 35:40.392
What's wrong?

35:43.341 --> 35:45.002
No offense, Halley, but...

35:47.411 --> 35:49.402
...your perfume is making me sick.

35:49.480 --> 35:52.472
Come on, I'm not
wearing perfume. I use soap.

35:59.724 --> 36:01.521
"Heightened sense of smell."

36:02.560 --> 36:05.654
Okay, so do you prefer
direct pee-on-a-strip

36:05.730 --> 36:07.061
or dip-in-a-cup?

36:10.201 --> 36:12.101
Maybe it's a false reading.

36:12.203 --> 36:15.229
Because I have heard
of things such as false readings.

36:15.306 --> 36:17.774
And the strips did not
look completely pink,

36:17.842 --> 36:19.275
only kind of pinkish, so...

36:19.343 --> 36:21.004
Five kits, Halley.

36:28.686 --> 36:30.176
What am I gonna do?

36:48.673 --> 36:51.141
So you take the car
without my permission

36:51.209 --> 36:53.939
in the middle of the night
on some kind of joy ride.

36:54.011 --> 36:56.241
- It wasn't a joy ride.
- Maybe I should...

36:56.314 --> 36:58.441
Don't think you're off the hook.

37:00.084 --> 37:03.212
You don't even have your license,
and you are a terrible driver.

37:03.287 --> 37:06.415
I was helping Scarlett get
some books at school... we left them...

37:06.490 --> 37:07.821
Forget it, Halley!

37:08.459 --> 37:09.448
Mom...

37:10.761 --> 37:13.855
taking your car out
is gonna seem like the least of it...

37:14.665 --> 37:17.156
because whatever
you're thinking right now...

37:18.869 --> 37:19.927
it's worse.

37:25.476 --> 37:28.468
One of you better tell me
before I have a nervous breakdown.

37:38.723 --> 37:40.054
I'm pregnant.

37:49.367 --> 37:51.528
Well, thank God
you told me in time.

38:00.244 --> 38:03.236
Shouldn't I be getting paid
to wear a dress this ugly?

38:03.314 --> 38:04.975
I'm sorry if you hate my taste

38:05.049 --> 38:07.984
and you think it's so awful
you have to be in my wedding,

38:08.052 --> 38:09.383
but you are my sister.

38:09.453 --> 38:12.388
- It's an emotional time.
- All right. I was just joking.

38:12.456 --> 38:16.358
Just because you think up something
you think is funny, doesn't mean you say it.

38:18.162 --> 38:20.494
Okay, Ashley,
I'm sorry, all right?

38:20.564 --> 38:23.965
It's just...
I love the dress, really.

38:24.035 --> 38:26.435
I feel like a princess.
You know?

38:34.478 --> 38:35.638
I look awful.

38:36.947 --> 38:37.936
We'll fix it.

38:38.015 --> 38:40.210
It's not the dress
that needs fixing.

38:40.284 --> 38:41.615
It's me.

38:42.620 --> 38:45.612
Ashley, would you
drive Halley home?

38:45.690 --> 38:47.351
I have to get back to work.

39:06.010 --> 39:07.272
Give me my money back,

39:07.345 --> 39:12.681
you stupid, lying, feckless,
two-timing son of a bitch!

39:15.820 --> 39:17.310
Can I help you, ma'am?

39:26.430 --> 39:29.365
It stole my money, so, just...

39:30.301 --> 39:31.290
Here.

39:31.369 --> 39:34.338
This works
a little better sometimes.

39:43.848 --> 39:46.749
- What's your pleasure?
- Diet Coke sounds good.

39:47.418 --> 39:48.407
The last one.

39:53.491 --> 39:54.480
On me.

39:55.826 --> 39:58.260
I hope I didn't,
you know, kick it too...

39:59.063 --> 40:01.429
I think these machines are built

40:01.499 --> 40:04.093
to withstand a good booting
every now and then.

40:05.970 --> 40:08.234
- Steve Beckwith.
- Lydia Martin.

40:08.839 --> 40:10.238
Did I say "Martin"?

40:10.641 --> 40:12.472
It's Lydia Williams now.

40:12.543 --> 40:15.137
- Lydia Williams again.
- Williams, again?

40:17.314 --> 40:18.474
Nice to meet you.

40:22.620 --> 40:23.609
Thank you.

40:25.923 --> 40:27.652
Aren't you gonna wear lipstick?

40:28.159 --> 40:29.592
You sound like Mom.

40:29.660 --> 40:31.252
Can one of you zip me, please?

40:32.730 --> 40:35.563
You guys know you're
wearing the same dress, right?

40:36.767 --> 40:37.756
Unbelievable.

40:38.803 --> 40:40.930
You're grandmother's
in there changing.

40:41.005 --> 40:42.165
We practically are.

40:42.239 --> 40:43.968
- I'll change.
- No, I'll change.

40:44.041 --> 40:46.737
- I can change.
- No, I shouldn't wear black, anyway.

40:46.811 --> 40:50.303
Halley, could you please wear
something a little more feminine?

40:50.381 --> 40:53.714
Because the Warshers
are really traditional. Thank you.

40:53.784 --> 40:57.276
Sweetheart,
do you need the loo?

40:57.621 --> 41:00.283
Grandma, no.
I'm gonna use the one downstairs.

41:00.357 --> 41:04.191
Don't be silly.
Come on in.

41:04.261 --> 41:06.092
- Okay.
- I'm almost through.

41:17.074 --> 41:18.541
It smells like...

41:24.248 --> 41:27.809
Just burning a little incense.

41:27.885 --> 41:28.874
Mother?

41:30.821 --> 41:32.812
Are you smoking
the cannabis again?

41:34.124 --> 41:36.456
I had a little headache.

41:37.127 --> 41:40.290
But I'm feeling
really much better now.

41:46.704 --> 41:47.796
I knew we'd be late.

41:47.872 --> 41:49.032
We're fine.

41:52.176 --> 41:54.110
His parents are promptness nuts.

41:54.812 --> 41:56.143
I can't believe I'm late.

41:57.047 --> 42:00.380
That's what happens when
you make people change ten times.

42:02.987 --> 42:06.980
These leaves would make
a wonderful textile.

42:07.057 --> 42:08.388
Halley, look.

42:09.493 --> 42:13.554
I'll bet if we make
sheets of this pattern,

42:13.631 --> 42:15.622
we'd make a million dollars!

42:15.699 --> 42:17.860
Mother, please, not now.

42:20.271 --> 42:21.363
She's high.

42:21.438 --> 42:23.770
She's not high,
she's medicated.

42:28.178 --> 42:31.705
It's interesting...
when you make the "ow" sound,

42:31.782 --> 42:35.149
your mouth does
this funny thing in the corner.

42:35.219 --> 42:36.550
You're not sick anymore.

42:36.620 --> 42:39.248
You were only allowed
to use weed when you were sick.

42:39.323 --> 42:41.814
- Could you ring the bell?
- I do get headaches a lot.

42:41.892 --> 42:42.881
Smile.

42:44.428 --> 42:47.591
Does anyone else
hear wind chimes or is it just me?

42:47.665 --> 42:49.098
This is a total disaster.

42:50.067 --> 42:51.056
Shit!

42:55.372 --> 42:56.430
Hello.

42:58.275 --> 42:59.970
Now, I know it's turkey day,

43:00.044 --> 43:02.569
but we thought squab
would be most special.

43:02.646 --> 43:05.240
They're absolutely adorable.

43:06.750 --> 43:09.981
- Squab.
- Can I say I'm a vegetarian?

43:10.054 --> 43:11.043
No.

43:11.121 --> 43:15.649
It reminds me of a little
yellow parakeet I had when I was a girl.

43:16.126 --> 43:19.755
Such a sweet, smart little bird.

43:21.031 --> 43:23.295
- They look wonderful.
- Thank you.

43:24.001 --> 43:26.492
Marcella's such
a truly magnificent cook.

43:26.570 --> 43:28.504
We are lucky
to have found her.

43:28.572 --> 43:30.733
I bet there's a story in that.

43:31.108 --> 43:34.168
Tell me, how lost were you
before you were found?

43:35.913 --> 43:39.747
Because you look like a lady
who doesn't get lost very often.

43:39.817 --> 43:40.806
Grandma.

43:41.552 --> 43:44.988
She came with us 20 years ago,
when we moved here from Atlanta.

43:46.056 --> 43:48.149
She really raised our Lewis.

43:50.394 --> 43:52.658
I didn't realize
you were a working mother.

43:54.765 --> 43:56.096
I wasn't.

43:56.800 --> 43:59.564
She did go through
a brokerage training program.

43:59.637 --> 44:02.037
She was good.
Killer instinct.

44:02.840 --> 44:05.274
But she set her sights
on me, instead.

44:05.342 --> 44:08.072
I'd say I got
the best deal at the firm.

44:08.145 --> 44:09.476
He's all right.

44:09.546 --> 44:13.209
He's no Clark Gable...
but then very few men are.

44:14.385 --> 44:16.546
What was the name
of that character?

44:17.621 --> 44:18.781
Ashley.

44:20.257 --> 44:22.088
No, you're Ashley.

44:28.032 --> 44:30.432
The wedding plans
are coming along beautifully.

44:30.501 --> 44:33.561
Well, you holler if you need
any help at all, understand?

44:33.637 --> 44:36.105
I want this to be
a memorable affair.

44:36.173 --> 44:38.607
Carol does throw
one heck of a luncheon.

44:38.676 --> 44:41.577
That is my one regret
about not having more children.

44:41.645 --> 44:43.840
Having girls
must be such fun.

44:43.914 --> 44:46.405
But we always felt
that having an only child

44:46.483 --> 44:49.316
was a much better way
to mold and shape character.

44:49.386 --> 44:51.718
Ashley was alone
for her first six years.

44:51.789 --> 44:54.280
I like to think she got
the best of both worlds.

44:55.526 --> 44:57.517
My best friend is an only child.

44:59.363 --> 45:01.228
She's having a baby,

45:01.298 --> 45:04.665
which at our age is something
that obviously wasn't planned.

45:04.735 --> 45:07.898
And her mom is not really
thrilled about the whole situation,

45:07.971 --> 45:12.999
but I really think she's kind of
starting to get behind it now,

45:13.077 --> 45:14.066
so...

45:25.522 --> 45:27.183
Which way to the bathroom?

45:28.392 --> 45:30.223
Down the hall and to your left.

45:52.449 --> 45:56.180
Isn't it a surprise... our children
choosing to get married so young?

45:56.253 --> 45:59.654
I always thought Lewis would
take his time to find the right person.

46:02.993 --> 46:05.325
Well, it must be
the example of you and Dad.

46:06.063 --> 46:09.226
I mean...
you make marriage seem so fun.

46:10.234 --> 46:13.067
And Ashley's
a lot like you, Mom.

46:17.741 --> 46:20.232
She's a very determined woman.

46:31.622 --> 46:32.953
Open the door, Halley.

46:33.824 --> 46:34.813
Young lady?

46:34.892 --> 46:37.053
Open the door.
Are you all right?

46:49.339 --> 46:51.170
Lovely evening. Thank you.

46:54.778 --> 46:58.441
- Thanks for sticking up for me.
- What are you talking about?

46:58.515 --> 47:01.484
Your mom obviously
doesn't want you to get married.

47:02.219 --> 47:04.551
You made it sound
like I'm some desperate woman

47:04.621 --> 47:06.885
somehow forcing you
into the whole thing.

47:06.957 --> 47:07.946
I did not.

47:08.025 --> 47:10.084
"Ashley's a very
determined woman."

47:10.160 --> 47:11.320
I didn't say that.

47:11.395 --> 47:13.829
I have witnesses!
Mom, you were there.

47:13.897 --> 47:15.990
You did say something
along those lines.

47:16.066 --> 47:17.693
Well, that is not
how I meant it.

47:17.768 --> 47:21.260
Lewis, you have a lovely family
and that is what is important.

47:21.338 --> 47:23.602
They weren't
exactly lovely to you.

47:24.041 --> 47:29.206
"Oh, You actually work for a living,
you lower class, pathetic divorcée?"

47:29.279 --> 47:30.769
Ashley, enough.

47:34.117 --> 47:36.244
I'm the one who got
humped by a dog in there.

48:16.793 --> 48:19.353
- Where are we?
- You'll see when we get there.

48:19.429 --> 48:22.023
- It's too dark to see.
- Well, just hold on.

49:04.942 --> 49:07.775
Me and Sherwood found
this place a couple years ago.

49:09.279 --> 49:10.769
We used to come here.

49:17.321 --> 49:18.310
You like it?

49:20.257 --> 49:21.588
Yeah.

49:23.860 --> 49:25.452
Yeah, come on. Let's dance.

49:25.529 --> 49:26.518
- No.
- Yes.

49:31.635 --> 49:33.227
Come on, Macon.

49:33.303 --> 49:34.292
No.

49:35.072 --> 49:36.471
Please? Come on, Macon.

49:37.240 --> 49:38.730
- No.
- Please.

49:40.043 --> 49:42.341
You look great, but I just...

50:21.485 --> 50:23.476
Michael's parents
moved to Florida.

50:24.221 --> 50:25.711
You still have to tell them.

50:26.590 --> 50:27.579
I know.

50:29.292 --> 50:32.625
I just can't figure out
what to say that makes any sense.

50:33.397 --> 50:37.128
Which makes sense, given that none
of what's happened makes any sense.

50:40.170 --> 50:41.660
You know, it's weird.

50:43.073 --> 50:45.735
Because if you were
the one that was pregnant...

50:46.676 --> 50:50.635
I would understand you
considering having an abortion

50:50.714 --> 50:54.115
or putting the baby
up for adoption.

50:56.219 --> 50:58.619
You can still put
the baby up for adoption.

50:59.790 --> 51:00.779
No.

51:02.559 --> 51:04.083
I know all the arguments.

51:06.463 --> 51:08.124
And I know
what I'm giving up.

51:12.102 --> 51:16.004
And I know that nothing is
gonna be normal for me anymore.

51:18.975 --> 51:21.409
But what is normal, anyway?

51:23.313 --> 51:25.804
Growing up
with my mom sure wasn't.

51:28.351 --> 51:29.841
Losing Michael wasn't.

51:34.724 --> 51:38.888
I used to think that my family was
the picture-perfect example of normal.

51:40.063 --> 51:41.052
Us.

51:43.366 --> 51:46.767
Maybe being abnormal
is what's normal... right?

51:46.837 --> 51:48.395
Yeah, like you and Macon.

51:49.973 --> 51:51.304
It doesn't make sense...

51:51.374 --> 51:53.865
you falling in love
with a guy like him.

51:53.944 --> 51:57.072
I'm not falling in love
with him, I like kissing him.

51:58.548 --> 52:00.106
We're just friends.

52:00.183 --> 52:01.275
With benefits.

52:02.185 --> 52:03.345
Shut up.

52:04.588 --> 52:07.284
- Bye, I'm leaving.
- You've got it bad.

52:26.576 --> 52:28.510
I hope this isn't a bad time.

52:33.850 --> 52:37.013
I know this is awfully
forward of me, but...

52:38.155 --> 52:40.146
I can't stop thinking about you.

52:51.668 --> 52:52.999
You're out of uniform.

52:54.671 --> 52:57.834
Oh, that. I forgot I was
wearing that. Didn't I explain?

52:57.908 --> 53:00.877
I'm a Civil War reenactor...
a little hobby.

53:00.944 --> 53:05.438
I like thinking about a time when honor
and chivalry really meant something.

53:06.616 --> 53:09.050
I know I've been
slow to take action.

53:09.119 --> 53:10.108
Slow's good.

53:10.654 --> 53:12.815
Would dinner tonight be too fast?

53:13.657 --> 53:14.646
Yes.

53:15.559 --> 53:17.288
I mean, no.
I mean, I'd love to.

53:32.976 --> 53:34.034
Cheers.

54:06.009 --> 54:06.998
Friends?

54:07.944 --> 54:08.933
Friends.

54:12.849 --> 54:15.340
Steve, I had a lovely time.

54:27.964 --> 54:28.953
Good night.

54:38.275 --> 54:40.436
- I was just...
- You were just leaving.

54:40.510 --> 54:41.602
Exactly.

54:46.383 --> 54:48.874
This is how you conduct
yourself in your own home?

54:48.952 --> 54:50.442
You said it...
my own home.

54:50.520 --> 54:53.318
That implies I have a right
to choose what I do.

54:53.390 --> 54:56.052
Halley Marie Martin,
conduct unbecoming.

54:56.726 --> 54:57.715
No!

55:03.333 --> 55:05.733
You never told me
you were serious about this boy.

55:06.303 --> 55:07.463
I'm not serious.

55:07.537 --> 55:10.097
That's what you do with people
you're not serious about?

55:10.173 --> 55:11.162
You know what?

55:11.241 --> 55:13.300
Maybe if you had
a little bit more fun,

55:13.376 --> 55:15.901
you wouldn't be
in the position you're in right now.

55:15.979 --> 55:18.140
Where is all
this attitude coming from?

55:18.214 --> 55:19.704
This is not like you.

55:19.783 --> 55:21.512
Like me?
You don't even know me.

55:21.584 --> 55:24.075
Maybe you're just not
very good at knowing people.

55:24.154 --> 55:26.179
How well do you know
that strange boy?

55:26.256 --> 55:29.089
Mom, He's not strange, okay?
His name is Macon.

55:29.159 --> 55:31.525
And maybe if you paid
attention to anyone...

55:31.594 --> 55:35.587
God forbid... besides yourself
and Ashley and her stupid wedding,

55:35.665 --> 55:36.996
you would know that.

55:52.148 --> 55:53.308
I'm trying.

55:56.219 --> 55:59.552
Halley, you used to talk to me.

55:59.622 --> 56:02.955
Yeah, and you were
too busy hating Dad to listen.

56:13.436 --> 56:15.597
I'm sorry you've had
to go through this.

56:20.543 --> 56:21.874
I hate Dad...

56:23.947 --> 56:25.881
so much for doing this to us.

56:28.118 --> 56:29.881
I hate him, I hate him.

56:33.456 --> 56:36.789
And then I don't hate him,
and I feel bad for hating him...

56:36.860 --> 56:39.351
Sweetie, I don't want
you to hate your father.

56:39.429 --> 56:41.090
He's a decent man.

56:45.668 --> 56:47.465
I don't want you
to hate me either,

56:47.537 --> 56:50.700
but I am going to have to start
laying down some rules around here.

56:50.774 --> 56:51.763
Here we go.

56:51.841 --> 56:54.241
Halley, you're grounded
until next year.

56:54.310 --> 56:55.299
No.

56:55.979 --> 56:58.038
You promised me that I could go

56:58.114 --> 57:01.345
to the New Year's Eve party
with Macon... Mom, please!

57:01.418 --> 57:04.649
No. No buts,
no New Year's Eve, no Macon.

57:06.890 --> 57:07.879
God!

57:18.268 --> 57:20.099
"Dear Mr. And Mrs. Sherwood...

57:21.237 --> 57:23.899
Guess what?
You're gonna be grandparents"...

57:24.307 --> 57:25.638
Exclamation point.

57:30.680 --> 57:33.843
Why don't you try telling Michael's
parents what you really feel?

57:45.895 --> 57:47.055
Macon Land.

57:49.566 --> 57:51.056
Happy New Year.

57:54.070 --> 57:55.401
Happy New Year.

58:41.551 --> 58:43.985
Hey, Macon, the man.

58:44.053 --> 58:45.042
Hi.

58:46.489 --> 58:49.549
- The party's just arrived.
- The party has... I'm here.

58:54.631 --> 58:57.293
- Yeah.
- Okay. Hold still.

58:58.701 --> 58:59.690
Sorry.

59:09.479 --> 59:11.640
Now, you are pretty.

59:16.486 --> 59:18.818
Come on, you can
smile better than that.

59:21.291 --> 59:23.191
What? She doesn't
know how to smile?

59:23.259 --> 59:24.749
Maybe she doesn't want to.

59:24.827 --> 59:26.761
Well, excuse me for breathing.

59:26.829 --> 59:28.660
Yeah, you're breathing too close.

59:29.299 --> 59:30.960
- Sorry about this.
- It's okay.

59:32.902 --> 59:35.063
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

59:36.973 --> 59:38.565
Here's to the new year, right?

59:39.242 --> 59:42.075
Yeah, right.
To the... to the new year.

59:43.246 --> 59:45.578
Okay, knock-knock. Police raid.

59:48.051 --> 59:51.418
Hey, Macon, my man... what's up?

59:51.487 --> 59:52.977
What's up with you?

59:55.425 --> 59:56.915
I lost my damn earring.

59:57.994 --> 59:58.983
Hey, Macon.

01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:02.492
Hi, Halley.

01:00:03.733 --> 01:00:04.722
Hi.

01:00:05.702 --> 01:00:06.691
Thanks.

01:00:12.241 --> 01:00:13.401
Nice name.

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:18.841
Who wants to see my ferret?

01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:23.148
Dude, I have one.
Come on, dude.

01:00:25.054 --> 01:00:28.046
I put a little hat on him
and everything. It's awesome.

01:00:40.336 --> 01:00:42.930
So, when's
Scarlett due, anyway?

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:48.570
You know?

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:51.375
Yeah, my mom's
a bookkeeper in her doctor's office,

01:00:51.447 --> 01:00:54.382
but... don't worry.
I haven't told anyone.

01:00:55.551 --> 01:00:56.882
Third week of May.

01:00:58.454 --> 01:01:00.445
God, that is so freaky.

01:01:02.291 --> 01:01:04.088
You know, it's weird, but...

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.219
I didn't even know
they had hooked up.

01:01:07.263 --> 01:01:09.823
Really?
They went out all summer.

01:01:09.899 --> 01:01:10.957
Did they?

01:01:11.034 --> 01:01:13.502
Yeah, and he was
completely in love with her.

01:01:14.037 --> 01:01:15.766
She's ruining her life, you know.

01:01:15.838 --> 01:01:18.102
I think I'd kill myself
before I had a baby.

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:21.007
I know enough to know
I wouldn't be able to handle it.

01:01:22.378 --> 01:01:25.142
You're probably right,
because you're not Scarlett.

01:01:25.782 --> 01:01:26.771
Right.

01:01:27.617 --> 01:01:28.948
Thank God for that.

01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:19.617
What's wrong?

01:03:24.233 --> 01:03:25.222
I'm sorry.

01:03:29.005 --> 01:03:30.939
Halley, where are you going?

01:03:45.788 --> 01:03:49.781
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

01:03:49.859 --> 01:03:53.022
six, five, four,

01:03:53.095 --> 01:03:56.189
three, two, one.

01:04:19.655 --> 01:04:20.815
I'm sorry.

01:04:26.863 --> 01:04:28.194
I really am.

01:04:33.469 --> 01:04:34.959
What was that all about?

01:04:38.441 --> 01:04:40.773
I thought you wanted
us to be together.

01:04:42.945 --> 01:04:46.108
I do... but, "together"?

01:04:47.650 --> 01:04:52.986
It's so official
and so big for us.

01:04:53.689 --> 01:04:56.522
Maybe you should just say
what you feel for once.

01:04:58.261 --> 01:04:59.592
I could do that.

01:05:01.764 --> 01:05:02.753
I can.

01:05:04.066 --> 01:05:05.226
I can.

01:05:08.604 --> 01:05:12.096
I felt like I had to get
out of there because I might...

01:05:14.677 --> 01:05:15.837
really...

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:20.572
care about you, and...

01:05:24.353 --> 01:05:27.516
and it scared me so much
because that meant that...

01:05:29.425 --> 01:05:30.756
you could hurt me.

01:05:32.962 --> 01:05:35.795
Or maybe I just
didn't feel ready.

01:05:39.735 --> 01:05:42.067
To like someone... that much.

01:05:44.874 --> 01:05:46.034
And I like you.

01:05:48.511 --> 01:05:50.570
Don't make it
so complicated, Halley.

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:45.657
Some people fall in love.

01:06:46.969 --> 01:06:48.960
I had to crash into it.

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:09.013
Hey, Baby.

01:07:09.725 --> 01:07:10.885
Hi.

01:07:12.328 --> 01:07:13.488
I'm sorry.

01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:16.261
You gave us quite a scare.

01:07:18.367 --> 01:07:19.527
God.

01:07:20.536 --> 01:07:22.367
And I ruined your party, too.

01:07:23.639 --> 01:07:25.470
I'm not concerned with the party.

01:07:25.541 --> 01:07:28.840
Your date with Steve. I know
that was so important to you.

01:07:28.911 --> 01:07:31.402
Halley, I know you were
with Macon Forrester.

01:07:34.183 --> 01:07:36.413
Mom, it was not his fault, though.

01:07:36.485 --> 01:07:39.010
We were trying to leave
this really bad party.

01:07:39.088 --> 01:07:42.251
He was letting me drive...
you know I'm like the worst driver,

01:07:42.324 --> 01:07:43.814
and I could not even see...

01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:48.057
Halley, save your strength. You're gonna
need it to come up with better excuses.

01:08:09.552 --> 01:08:11.713
Macon wasn't there
when I woke up.

01:08:12.321 --> 01:08:14.482
Macon wasn't there when I left.

01:08:16.492 --> 01:08:20.656
Macon wasn't there
the whole next week at school.

01:08:21.697 --> 01:08:24.188
What do you expect
when you break your own rules?

01:08:28.037 --> 01:08:29.197
Any word from him?

01:08:29.270 --> 01:08:30.260
No.

01:08:34.076 --> 01:08:36.237
I guess that's
what guys are good at, right?

01:08:38.013 --> 01:08:39.002
Disappearing?

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:04.636
Hey. I'm back.

01:09:11.046 --> 01:09:12.809
You really don't get it, do you?

01:09:16.585 --> 01:09:19.076
I'm really not in the mood
to wait for you to grow up.

01:10:13.509 --> 01:10:16.342
Oh, my... are you okay?

01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:19.540
Hi, Halley.

01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:23.509
I think I just dropped my keys.

01:10:23.586 --> 01:10:25.349
No, they're in the door. Come on.

01:10:26.989 --> 01:10:29.423
Stop spinning! Stop spinning.

01:10:29.491 --> 01:10:31.083
I'm not spinning!

01:10:32.962 --> 01:10:34.122
Quiet!

01:10:36.932 --> 01:10:38.593
Maybe you should be quiet.

01:10:39.602 --> 01:10:40.933
That's what you should do.

01:10:41.604 --> 01:10:42.764
Upstairs.

01:10:42.838 --> 01:10:45.500
Oh, Halley,
you're such a good sister.

01:10:48.177 --> 01:10:51.510
You think I'm doing those?
I am not doing those.

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:52.569
Be careful.

01:10:53.148 --> 01:10:55.981
Christ, Halley.
It's all right.

01:10:57.519 --> 01:11:01.387
This is my bachelorette party.

01:11:01.890 --> 01:11:03.983
I am a bachelorette.

01:11:17.573 --> 01:11:20.633
Thank you, little sister.

01:11:21.377 --> 01:11:23.140
You are the greatest.

01:11:23.212 --> 01:11:26.545
Okay, Ashley,
please just take this.

01:11:27.182 --> 01:11:28.171
Jesus. What...

01:11:31.153 --> 01:11:32.142
You just...

01:11:34.456 --> 01:11:38.051
Please. Come on.
Mom is upstairs sleeping.

01:11:38.127 --> 01:11:39.458
Mom's not home.

01:11:40.896 --> 01:11:43.228
Really? And how
would you know that?

01:11:44.333 --> 01:11:47.769
Friday night she sneaks out
to have sex with Steve.

01:11:56.512 --> 01:11:57.672
She told you that?

01:11:58.847 --> 01:12:00.405
She didn't want you to know.

01:12:01.183 --> 01:12:04.675
God, why do people think
that I can't handle the truth?

01:12:14.596 --> 01:12:16.791
Go on, you hatchet-faced scarecrow!

01:12:16.865 --> 01:12:18.093
You baboon!

01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:19.930
- You bag of bones!
- You old weasel face!

01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:22.436
- Sourpuss!
- Sorry old flabby nincompoop!

01:12:24.573 --> 01:12:25.904
Top of the morning to you.

01:12:26.842 --> 01:12:27.831
How is she?

01:12:32.147 --> 01:12:33.136
Sweetie.

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:43.184
A hangover kit.

01:12:44.526 --> 01:12:47.086
Not to appear superior,
but I did limit myself

01:12:47.162 --> 01:12:49.756
to one glass of champagne,
thank you very much.

01:12:49.832 --> 01:12:52.562
If it wasn't for Halley,
I would've died, probably.

01:12:52.634 --> 01:12:55.068
No, you just would've
woken up on the porch.

01:12:55.904 --> 01:12:57.895
Bet the neighbors
would've loved that.

01:12:58.507 --> 01:13:02.671
Right, especially with the men's
underwear around her neck.

01:13:04.446 --> 01:13:05.606
Underwear?

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:08.911
It was nothing. It was stupid.

01:13:08.984 --> 01:13:10.918
Underwear is not nothing.

01:13:12.087 --> 01:13:14.988
No, they were
pretty much nothing.

01:13:17.826 --> 01:13:19.851
We promised
each other no strippers.

01:13:19.928 --> 01:13:23.762
I know, Lewis, I know, but
I was at the mercy of my friends.

01:13:23.832 --> 01:13:26.392
Don't promises we make
to each other mean anything?

01:13:26.468 --> 01:13:28.663
Of course they mean
something, Lewis.

01:13:28.737 --> 01:13:30.170
God, don't be so uptight!

01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:33.003
Oh, I'm uptight?
I'm not uptight!

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:35.100
Yes, Lewis, you are.
You are uptight.

01:13:35.177 --> 01:13:37.441
You know what else?
Halley was right about you.

01:13:37.513 --> 01:13:39.777
You have got
a broomstick up your butt.

01:13:39.848 --> 01:13:41.110
I never said that!

01:13:41.183 --> 01:13:42.946
Okay, well, guess who put it there?

01:13:43.018 --> 01:13:45.816
Don't talk to me that way.
Maybe I'll find somebody fun!

01:13:45.888 --> 01:13:47.719
To tell the truth,
you're no fun!

01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:49.485
We made
a promise to each other,

01:13:49.558 --> 01:13:52.425
but you don't keep it
because you're self-absorbed.

01:13:52.494 --> 01:13:53.893
Don't talk to me that way.

01:13:53.962 --> 01:13:55.520
Hello. Good morning, Halley.

01:13:56.899 --> 01:13:59.527
- What's going on?
- I think they're breaking up.

01:13:59.601 --> 01:14:00.761
Relax. You're no fun.

01:14:00.836 --> 01:14:03.771
Marriage is a promise,
and a promise has to be kept.

01:14:03.839 --> 01:14:06.171
Not every argument
leads to a breakup.

01:14:07.476 --> 01:14:08.534
For real!

01:14:12.848 --> 01:14:14.179
The wedding is off.

01:14:54.189 --> 01:14:58.717
- I've been trying to say I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry doesn't always cut it, Macon!

01:15:03.365 --> 01:15:05.595
I couldn't stay
with you at the hospital.

01:15:05.667 --> 01:15:08.966
I know I should have, but think
how much more freaked out

01:15:09.037 --> 01:15:11.528
your mom would've got
if she'd have seen me.

01:15:14.409 --> 01:15:15.740
Oh, my God.

01:15:17.045 --> 01:15:19.172
Okay. Wow, thank you so much.

01:15:19.248 --> 01:15:22.115
So, you were ditching me
for my own benefit.

01:15:24.853 --> 01:15:26.844
No, that's not it.

01:15:28.056 --> 01:15:29.387
I didn't ditch you.

01:15:31.093 --> 01:15:32.082
L...

01:15:34.363 --> 01:15:35.694
Okay, I...

01:15:37.833 --> 01:15:39.164
I freaked out.

01:15:40.802 --> 01:15:44.033
I'm not used to feeling
this way about somebody.

01:15:44.106 --> 01:15:45.437
And I just...

01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:48.866
I couldn't believe
I almost lost you, too.

01:15:56.418 --> 01:15:59.285
Here. Come on,
I'll help you eat them.

01:16:00.422 --> 01:16:03.357
No. I don't want any.

01:16:07.429 --> 01:16:09.090
I can't see you anymore.

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:13.829
Your mom will get over it.

01:16:13.902 --> 01:16:16.063
It's not my mom. It's me.

01:16:19.441 --> 01:16:21.932
And, of course,
if you do decide to get married,

01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:25.104
I can get my makeup and hair people
to do you on the big day.

01:16:25.747 --> 01:16:28.045
If you decide
not to get married,

01:16:28.116 --> 01:16:31.017
I think you should let them
do some work on you anyway,

01:16:31.086 --> 01:16:33.987
because you are gonna
want to look your best

01:16:34.056 --> 01:16:35.717
when you get back out there.

01:16:39.494 --> 01:16:42.986
Darling, there is nothing wrong
with canceling a wedding.

01:16:43.065 --> 01:16:45.295
No, it's indefinitely postponed.

01:16:45.367 --> 01:16:47.767
That's what we're
supposed to say officially.

01:16:48.203 --> 01:16:49.363
My mom found out.

01:16:49.438 --> 01:16:53.431
Actually, I haven't really made up
my mind yet, so if everybody could just...

01:16:53.508 --> 01:16:54.839
Oh, Honey.

01:16:56.612 --> 01:16:57.943
Give me a hug.

01:17:01.049 --> 01:17:04.485
Sweetie, you never know
what's gonna happen. Okay?

01:17:04.553 --> 01:17:07.283
For a while there,
I thought I'd never get married.

01:17:07.889 --> 01:17:09.720
Finally, I had to put my foot down

01:17:09.791 --> 01:17:12.282
or my guy here
would never have left...

01:17:20.502 --> 01:17:21.662
I'll get that.

01:17:26.675 --> 01:17:27.664
Hello?

01:17:29.878 --> 01:17:33.712
Honey, it's their mother
calling from Virginia.

01:17:33.782 --> 01:17:36.114
It seems
your grandmother had a bad fall.

01:17:36.184 --> 01:17:38.345
Your mother wants you
to meet her there.

01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:44.387
Do you think
she's okay in there?

01:17:45.227 --> 01:17:46.558
It has been a while.

01:17:47.362 --> 01:17:49.421
Grandma, are you all right?

01:17:50.198 --> 01:17:54.862
Yes, I'm just smoking
a little marijuana.

01:17:57.105 --> 01:17:58.834
Look at that pattern.

01:18:00.442 --> 01:18:04.811
Is it just me, or is that the
spittin' image of Abraham Lincoln?

01:18:05.414 --> 01:18:08.577
Look, Halley, look.
There's the mole.

01:18:10.185 --> 01:18:12.176
Halley, you must see it!

01:18:12.254 --> 01:18:15.087
You're the one who sees
things no one else can see.

01:18:15.157 --> 01:18:16.988
- I do?
- Yes.

01:18:17.059 --> 01:18:19.357
Mother, you're not
supposed to be walking yet.

01:18:19.428 --> 01:18:22.864
Next time you fall like that,
you're going to break your hip, then die.

01:18:26.935 --> 01:18:30.268
You remember when we
went to see our comet together?

01:18:31.573 --> 01:18:33.564
Halley was too young
to remember that.

01:18:33.642 --> 01:18:34.802
No, I do remember.

01:18:34.876 --> 01:18:37.504
You can't possibly.
You remember hearing about it.

01:18:37.579 --> 01:18:38.910
No, mom, I do remember.

01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:42.108
Why does no one trust me
to know what I know anymore?

01:18:42.184 --> 01:18:43.515
God.

01:18:45.887 --> 01:18:46.876
God!

01:18:56.965 --> 01:19:00.560
She doesn't even think
that my own memories belong to me.

01:19:04.172 --> 01:19:06.504
Darling, she's your mother.

01:19:14.382 --> 01:19:18.045
Now, tell me
about this fella of yours.

01:19:18.954 --> 01:19:20.945
Who told you about that?

01:19:23.091 --> 01:19:26.754
Grandma, it's really over.

01:19:28.330 --> 01:19:32.164
First loves are never really over.

01:19:35.203 --> 01:19:37.364
Nobody's perfect, Sweetheart.

01:19:37.439 --> 01:19:40.602
But that doesn't mean
it wasn't worth your while.

01:19:44.513 --> 01:19:47.004
Oh, boy!
Do I have the munchies!

01:19:53.722 --> 01:19:56.691
- What about him?
- He's not terrible looking.

01:19:56.758 --> 01:20:00.592
Yeah, he's even cute in that
geeky way that you like guys, Ashley.

01:20:01.363 --> 01:20:02.523
Halley, it's...

01:20:04.199 --> 01:20:05.359
It's Lewis.

01:20:34.529 --> 01:20:37.464
Ashley, love of my life...

01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:39.497
life of my heart...

01:20:40.702 --> 01:20:44.138
once again... will you marry me?

01:20:50.545 --> 01:20:51.876
Yes.

01:20:53.815 --> 01:20:55.305
Yes. How crazy.

01:20:55.784 --> 01:20:57.411
I can't believe it.

01:21:04.259 --> 01:21:05.248
Do it.

01:21:19.908 --> 01:21:21.239
I owe you one.

01:21:23.311 --> 01:21:24.801
For?

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:26.871
Macon's a really great guy.

01:21:27.549 --> 01:21:28.538
See ya, Halley.

01:21:43.765 --> 01:21:45.596
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:21:50.705 --> 01:21:52.832
I had no idea
that you guys were like...

01:21:53.909 --> 01:21:55.137
hanging out.

01:21:56.111 --> 01:21:57.772
Elizabeth Gunderson and me?

01:21:57.846 --> 01:21:58.835
No, we're just...

01:21:58.914 --> 01:22:00.745
- Friends?
- Yeah.

01:22:01.683 --> 01:22:02.672
Right.

01:22:04.452 --> 01:22:07.114
No, it's fine because
we had our thing,

01:22:07.188 --> 01:22:10.351
and it was fun...
until it wasn't anymore, right?

01:22:10.425 --> 01:22:11.585
No, that's not it.

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:15.721
When the going gets tough, it's best
to just keep going, don't you think?

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:20.331
Would you listen to me for a sec?

01:22:30.512 --> 01:22:31.843
And to my bride.

01:22:32.414 --> 01:22:35.747
Thank you for showing me
that socks don't need to be ironed...

01:22:36.618 --> 01:22:39.348
that one needn't employ
the Dewey decimal system

01:22:39.454 --> 01:22:40.978
for their CD collection...

01:22:42.057 --> 01:22:45.424
and that, in the end, it doesn't
make a whole lot of difference

01:22:45.493 --> 01:22:48.462
whether you start
the toilet paper facing up or down.

01:22:49.297 --> 01:22:51.458
Despite what
my parents taught me.

01:22:53.501 --> 01:22:57.961
Because, Ashley, you have
shown me that life is worth embracing.

01:22:58.039 --> 01:23:00.530
Even if it means
making a giant fool of yourself.

01:23:01.409 --> 01:23:03.070
And lucky for me,

01:23:03.144 --> 01:23:06.545
you're willing to marry the guy
who's been the biggest fool of all.

01:23:06.614 --> 01:23:08.878
So here's to a lifetime

01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:13.546
of big, messy,
wonderfully out-of-order moments

01:23:13.621 --> 01:23:15.953
with the most
beautiful woman in the world...

01:23:16.024 --> 01:23:17.355
my bride.

01:24:02.003 --> 01:24:05.404
Your big sister
is getting married in 3 1/2 hours.

01:24:09.411 --> 01:24:11.902
You know if you
get nervous, you can always...

01:24:13.915 --> 01:24:15.405
You remember the sign.

01:24:15.483 --> 01:24:17.815
Of course. You taught
it to me, remember?

01:24:18.286 --> 01:24:19.776
So, you know. Just...

01:24:21.456 --> 01:24:22.445
Like that.

01:24:22.791 --> 01:24:25.760
I'll do something.
I'll yell, "fire," okay?

01:24:25.827 --> 01:24:27.192
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:34.894
And we're back
with the big dog of soft rock,

01:24:34.969 --> 01:24:38.200
WDYG, 94 FM.
"We dig the dog."

01:24:38.273 --> 01:24:40.503
This is Daddy Dog
himself, Len Martin,

01:24:40.575 --> 01:24:43.135
coming to you today
on a very special day,

01:24:43.211 --> 01:24:45.907
'cause one of my
very own puppies... the eldest...

01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:47.572
Ashley, is getting married.

01:24:47.649 --> 01:24:50.311
Lorna, Honey,
any words of wisdom

01:24:50.385 --> 01:24:52.910
coming from you,
my very own newlywed?

01:24:53.988 --> 01:24:55.285
Waterproof mascara.

01:24:55.356 --> 01:24:59.122
I'm gonna borrow yours, 'cause
Daddy's gonna be weeping like a baby.

01:24:59.194 --> 01:25:02.129
All right, let's kick off
this Power Hour Of Love.

01:25:03.798 --> 01:25:05.390
- Are you there?
- Security?

01:25:05.467 --> 01:25:07.935
Hey, give me... come on.
This is my job!

01:25:10.805 --> 01:25:12.295
My Halley?

01:25:12.373 --> 01:25:15.001
I don't know how to get you
to listen, but maybe...

01:25:15.076 --> 01:25:17.840
- Let him talk.
- Just hear me out.

01:25:20.515 --> 01:25:22.176
I suck with words.

01:25:23.852 --> 01:25:26.286
But sometimes,
words aren't the thing.

01:25:26.354 --> 01:25:28.982
Love isn't about words,
it's about what you do.

01:25:29.057 --> 01:25:31.321
And what I did...

01:25:31.392 --> 01:25:34.793
running away, it was stupid.

01:25:35.663 --> 01:25:38.860
We both know love's
a big, scary, evil concept.

01:25:38.933 --> 01:25:42.369
But if you feel it, it's gonna
follow you around like a hungry dog

01:25:42.437 --> 01:25:43.927
no matter how far you run.

01:25:44.005 --> 01:25:46.473
Wait. I didn't mean
to say love's a dog.

01:25:46.541 --> 01:25:49.704
I just mean,
I'm not going anywhere.

01:25:50.411 --> 01:25:51.901
I love you, Halley.

01:25:53.515 --> 01:25:56.006
If love beats us up,
let's beat it up right back.

01:25:56.084 --> 01:25:57.415
We could do this.

01:25:57.485 --> 01:26:00.977
If you're ready to make the jump,
I'll be right here to catch you.

01:26:08.296 --> 01:26:12.756
And what a powerful
Power Hour Of Love it has been.

01:26:12.834 --> 01:26:18.033
This is Len Martin for WDYG,
the Big Dog of soft rock.

01:26:18.106 --> 01:26:19.971
That's right.
Romance is in the air.

01:26:20.041 --> 01:26:21.941
It's everywhere
here today, folks.

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:25.241
This next song is going out
to that young lady in question...

01:26:25.313 --> 01:26:28.043
Miss Halley Martin
and her big sister Ashley,

01:26:28.116 --> 01:26:29.777
'cause Daddy loves you.

01:26:50.405 --> 01:26:51.736
You look beautiful.

01:26:53.208 --> 01:26:54.732
You look beautiful, Mom.

01:26:58.246 --> 01:27:00.180
I'm not too old to wear pink?

01:27:00.548 --> 01:27:01.537
No.

01:27:08.089 --> 01:27:11.081
I look like
a giant helium balloon.

01:27:11.159 --> 01:27:12.490
Come on. We have to go.

01:27:17.432 --> 01:27:18.922
I'm gonna walk over.

01:27:21.636 --> 01:27:23.126
I'll meet you there.

01:28:22.497 --> 01:28:24.158
Let's get Halley!

01:28:25.066 --> 01:28:27.057
Back seat.
I need to lie down.

01:29:13.047 --> 01:29:14.207
Please be seated.

01:29:15.917 --> 01:29:19.648
We have come together today
to join in Holy Matrimony

01:29:19.721 --> 01:29:23.054
Ashley Renee Martin
and Lewis Gibson Warsher II.

01:29:23.858 --> 01:29:25.985
If any among you know any reason

01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:28.551
why this couple
may not lawfully be married,

01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:31.120
declare it now
or forever hold your peace.

01:29:41.642 --> 01:29:45.874
Do you, Lewis, promise to love,
honor, and cherish Ashley

01:29:45.947 --> 01:29:48.916
from this day forward,
for richer or for poorer,

01:29:48.983 --> 01:29:50.974
in sickness and in health,

01:29:51.052 --> 01:29:53.748
forsaking all others
as long as you both shall live?

01:29:53.821 --> 01:29:55.152
I do.

01:29:56.758 --> 01:30:00.421
And do you, Ashley, promise
to love, honor, and cherish Lewis

01:30:00.495 --> 01:30:02.190
for richer or for poorer,

01:30:02.263 --> 01:30:03.753
in sickness and in health,

01:30:03.831 --> 01:30:06.629
forsaking all others
as long as you both shall live?

01:30:06.701 --> 01:30:07.861
I do.

01:30:07.935 --> 01:30:09.095
The rings?

01:30:17.612 --> 01:30:20.979
Dear friends, let us ask God
to bless these rings

01:30:21.048 --> 01:30:23.539
as a symbol
of their love everlasting.

01:30:24.719 --> 01:30:27.313
No. No, the other finger.
That's right.

01:30:27.388 --> 01:30:29.879
- Ashley, Lewis...
- She's having the baby.

01:30:29.957 --> 01:30:32.255
- It is now my delight...
- Please be quiet.

01:30:32.326 --> 01:30:35.124
...and honor to declare you
husband and wife.

01:30:35.196 --> 01:30:37.187
You may now kiss the bride.

01:30:43.738 --> 01:30:45.865
She's having the baby. Now.

01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:46.929
Right now?

01:30:47.809 --> 01:30:50.107
Scarlett's having the baby.
I have to go.

01:30:50.178 --> 01:30:53.511
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Scarlett's having the baby.

01:31:17.972 --> 01:31:18.961
Breathe.

01:31:20.741 --> 01:31:23.073
Wait, wait, wait! No.

01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:26.469
Shit!

01:31:27.114 --> 01:31:28.274
Oh, for heaven's sake.

01:31:28.649 --> 01:31:29.638
It's okay.

01:31:30.585 --> 01:31:32.075
You're gonna have the baby!

01:31:34.922 --> 01:31:36.583
Thank you so much. Thanks.

01:31:36.657 --> 01:31:39.717
You have got to do something.
That was just a dreadful scene.

01:31:39.794 --> 01:31:42.285
Now the seating arrangement's
gonna be a disaster.

01:31:42.363 --> 01:31:44.661
One empty seat
throws everything off.

01:31:44.732 --> 01:31:47.064
Mother, stop it. Okay?

01:31:49.303 --> 01:31:51.294
It doesn't get
any better than this.

01:31:53.774 --> 01:31:56.538
Squeeze my hand.
It's okay. We're gonna get there.

01:32:03.818 --> 01:32:06.582
I assume Daddy would like
to be in the delivery room?

01:32:06.654 --> 01:32:08.315
Me? No, no. L...

01:32:08.389 --> 01:32:10.380
- Baby!
- Mommy!

01:32:11.893 --> 01:32:13.656
- Hi, Sweetie.
- I need you.

01:32:13.728 --> 01:32:14.717
I'm her mother.

01:32:15.263 --> 01:32:17.925
- Miss Smith?
- It's okay. Thank you.

01:32:17.999 --> 01:32:19.330
Don't leave me.

01:32:39.287 --> 01:32:40.777
So, do you hate me?

01:32:44.025 --> 01:32:46.357
Not you, per se.

01:32:50.798 --> 01:32:53.130
I hate the way
your hair falls in your face.

01:32:56.103 --> 01:33:00.233
And I hate the way your voice
gets really low when you're serious.

01:33:02.143 --> 01:33:05.408
And I hate the way you bite
your bottom lip when you're nervous.

01:33:07.248 --> 01:33:10.411
And the way
your eyebrow goes... like that.

01:33:11.752 --> 01:33:12.741
I hate that.

01:33:17.692 --> 01:33:19.023
So, that's it?

01:33:19.093 --> 01:33:22.085
You just hate the way
I walk and talk and look?

01:33:22.163 --> 01:33:23.152
No.

01:33:24.198 --> 01:33:26.189
That Jedi mind trick thing?

01:33:27.201 --> 01:33:28.532
I hate that.

01:33:29.637 --> 01:33:30.968
Don't give up on me.

01:33:31.038 --> 01:33:32.369
I'm not.

01:33:34.175 --> 01:33:37.167
But you are gonna regret
ever having messed up.

01:33:38.346 --> 01:33:40.507
'Cause I'm gonna
make you pay for a long time.

01:33:42.717 --> 01:33:44.048
But first...

01:33:46.354 --> 01:33:49.016
You're going to take
three steps towards me.

01:33:58.265 --> 01:34:00.927
And you're going to wrap
your arms around my waist.

01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:04.965
And on the count of three...

01:34:05.039 --> 01:34:06.028
two...

01:34:15.916 --> 01:34:17.247
We're gonna dance.

01:34:22.916 --> 01:34:52.247
