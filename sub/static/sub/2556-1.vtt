<i>Kevin Flynn: The Grid.</i>

00:33.612 --> 00:35.925
<i>A digital frontier.</i>

00:37.918 --> 00:41.793
<i>I tried to picture clusters of information,
as they moved through the computer.</i>

00:43.074 --> 00:45.047
<i>What did they look like?</i>

00:45.958 --> 00:48.241
<i>Ships, motorcycles?</i>

00:48.722 --> 00:50.685
<i>Were the circuits like freeways?</i>

00:51.345 --> 00:53.258
<i>I kept dreaming of a world,</i>

00:53.258 --> 00:54.770
<i>I thought I'd never see.</i>

00:56.342 --> 00:58.204
<i>And then, one day.</i>

00:59.266 --> 01:00.407
Sam: You got in.

01:00.827 --> 01:02.630
Kevin: Ha, ha, ha, that's right, man.

01:02.871 --> 01:04.331
I got in.

01:39.117 --> 01:42.541
Kevin: And the world was more beautiful
than I ever dreamed.

01:42.752 --> 01:45.294
And also, more dangerous
than I ever dreamed.

01:45.594 --> 01:47.468
Get in bed now, come on.

01:48.288 --> 01:50.082
Now, I met a brave warrior.

01:50.092 --> 01:53.887
-Tron.
-Ba, ba, bom, bom, bommm.

01:53.887 --> 01:55.479
Kevin: TRON!

01:55.479 --> 01:56.991
Sam: He fights for the users.

01:56.991 --> 01:58.272
Kevin: He sure does.

01:58.272 --> 02:01.847
Oh man, he showed me things that no
one had ever imagined.

02:01.847 --> 02:05.832
Here at least. Disc battles fought
in spectacular arenas.

02:05.832 --> 02:08.866
Cycles that raced on ribbons of light.

02:09.096 --> 02:13.823
-So radical, and together,
-Sam: You built the grid.

02:13.823 --> 02:15.584
Kevin: We built a new grid.

02:15.589 --> 02:17.666
With programs and users.

02:17.667 --> 02:19.784
Now, I couldn't be in there all the time.

02:19.785 --> 02:23.936
So, I created a program in my own image.

02:23.937 --> 02:26.933
That could think, like you and me.

02:27.434 --> 02:30.831
And I called him,
CLU.

02:31.468 --> 02:33.885
Codified Likeness Utility.

02:33.886 --> 02:35.286
Kevin: That's right.

02:35.290 --> 02:41.107
And CLU, Tron and I, we built the
system where all information was free,

02:41.108 --> 02:44.600
And hope, beautiful.

02:46.554 --> 02:49.127
And then, one day.

02:50.266 --> 02:51.631
Something happened.

02:54.668 --> 02:58.077
Something...extraordinary.

03:00.840 --> 03:02.229
A miracle.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.697
What was it?

03:09.203 --> 03:11.351
That'll have to wait until next time.

03:12.225 --> 03:13.886
How 'bout I get to work.

03:13.889 --> 03:15.869
I'm wanna go with you, Dad.

03:15.870 --> 03:17.810
Yeah, well.

03:17.811 --> 03:20.505
One day, you will.

03:20.508 --> 03:22.245
I promise.

03:22.250 --> 03:23.647
To the grid?

03:23.652 --> 03:25.209
Good night, Sam.

03:27.587 --> 03:31.614
All right, what do you say tomorrow,
you and I hit the arcade?

03:31.622 --> 03:33.977
You can have a crack at the old man's
high score.

03:33.981 --> 03:35.883
First games on me.

03:38.565 --> 03:39.873
Can we play doubles?

03:39.874 --> 03:41.424
Sam: On the same team?

03:44.062 --> 03:46.276
We're always on the same team.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.263
<i>Good evening, our lead story.</i>

04:10.264 --> 04:13.606
<i>ENCOM CEO and video game Icon,
Kevin Flynn.</i>

04:13.607 --> 04:14.831
<i>has disappeared.</i>

04:14.833 --> 04:18.214
<i>He was best known for designing Tron,
and Space Paranoids.</i>

04:18.214 --> 04:20.951
<i>The two best selling video games in history.</i>

04:20.952 --> 04:24.112
<i>Flynn took ownership of ENCOM in 1982.</i>

04:24.113 --> 04:27.712
<i>And the company skyrocketed to the
top of the tech industry.</i>

04:27.713 --> 04:30.167
<i>But things changed in 1985.</i>

04:30.168 --> 04:34.280
<i>With the untimely death of Flynn's wife,
the mother of his young son, Sam.</i>

04:34.281 --> 04:39.337
<i>Recently ENCOM board members have been
troubled by the reports of Flynn's erratic</i>

04:39.338 --> 04:41.342
<i>even obsessive behavior.</i>

04:41.343 --> 04:44.442
<i>With Flynn missing, the company
is now in Chaos.</i>

04:44.443 --> 04:50.367
<i>This afternoon ENCOM's board moved to
seize control from Flynn's partner, Alan Bradley.</i>

04:50.368 --> 04:53.357
<i>Vowing to return the company to
profitability.</i>

04:53.367 --> 04:58.669
<i>Loyal to the end, Bradley maintains
his belief that Flynn is not missing.</i>

04:59.030 --> 05:01.643
<i>And is instead pursuing his dream of quote:</i>

05:01.644 --> 05:05.141
<i>"A digital frontier to reshape
the human condition".</i>

05:06.740 --> 05:09.392
In there is a new world.

05:09.393 --> 05:11.470
In there is our future.

05:11.471 --> 05:13.047
In there,

05:13.406 --> 05:15.852
is our destiny.

05:21.660 --> 05:25.780
<i> Even Flynn's most ardent supporters are
now acknowledging a difficult truth.</i>

05:25.781 --> 05:28.825
<i>Kevin Flynn may have simply, run away.</i>

05:28.833 --> 05:32.046
<i>And while Flynn's loyalists hope
for his imminent return.</i>

05:32.047 --> 05:36.102
<i>There is perhaps no one....</i>

05:41.096 --> 05:42.320
He's coming.

05:42.321 --> 05:43.726
He promised.

05:43.727 --> 05:45.275
Kevin's mother: Sam, you have to eat.

05:45.276 --> 05:46.400
Let go of me.

05:46.418 --> 05:47.889
Sam.

05:47.890 --> 05:50.581
<i>What will become of Flynn's legacy,
and the future of ENCOM.</i>

05:50.582 --> 05:54.572
<i>Will most likely depend on what becomes
of this now orphaned little boy.
-SAM!</i>

05:57.270 --> 05:59.544
Kevin's Mother: SAM, come back.

07:54.161 --> 07:56.101
Well that is a big door.

07:56.102 --> 07:59.101
Welcome everybody, please settle.

07:59.102 --> 08:03.178
I know it's late so I'll skip the pleasantries
and hand things over to our chairman.

08:03.181 --> 08:04.660
Richard Mackey

08:06.976 --> 08:09.743
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you, Claire.

08:11.312 --> 08:15.596
Tonight I am pleased to announce that
ENCOM's last fiscal year,

08:15.597 --> 08:19.092
was our most profitable, ever.

08:20.265 --> 08:21.635
Yes.

08:39.982 --> 08:44.654
And at midnight tonight, the 12th version of our flagship
operating system will hit the shelves.

08:44.655 --> 08:46.085
Around the world.

08:46.086 --> 08:48.819
Richard: I'm sure it comes as no surprise,

08:48.820 --> 08:52.243
who we have to acclaim. The head of
our software design team.

08:52.244 --> 08:57.314
A man who's father own uh, notable
history with ENCOM,

08:57.315 --> 08:59.839
helped make this company, what it is today.

09:01.470 --> 09:03.939
Edward Dillinger.

09:06.019 --> 09:07.120
Well done.

09:16.130 --> 09:20.213
We will be making our Debut on
Tokyo's Nikkei index.

09:20.214 --> 09:24.804
ENCOM's stock will now trade around the world.

09:24.805 --> 09:26.302
24/7

09:26.736 --> 09:28.742
Huh? Oh yes.

09:52.229 --> 09:53.254
Excuse me,

09:53.263 --> 09:55.341
Yes, Allan.

09:55.342 --> 10:00.505
Given the prices we charge to students, schools.

10:01.270 --> 10:04.702
What sort of improvements have been made
in Flynn

10:04.703 --> 10:08.228
I mean, uh, ENCOM O.S. twelve?

10:11.160 --> 10:13.050
This year we put a twelve on the box.

10:15.273 --> 10:19.356
Edward: O.S. 12 is the most secure
operating system ever released.

10:19.357 --> 10:23.659
The idea of sharing our software or
giving it away for free.

10:23.660 --> 10:26.180
Disappeared with, Kevin Flynn.

10:39.997 --> 10:41.577
We know you're here.

10:42.845 --> 10:44.089
Let's make this easy.

10:47.016 --> 10:48.816
Come on, come on.

10:56.855 --> 10:58.135
FREEZE!

10:59.009 --> 11:02.207
Okay, if there are no more questions.

11:02.241 --> 11:04.944
I would like you to meet,
our next blockbuster.

11:05.767 --> 11:07.831
ENCOM O.S. Twelve.

11:10.442 --> 11:11.824
Whoa!

11:12.772 --> 11:14.508
Just a few...bugs.

11:20.341 --> 11:21.674
Bear with us, one second.

11:23.987 --> 11:26.670
Stop! Stop, stop.
Stop, stop, will you just stop.

11:26.671 --> 11:27.674
For one second.

11:32.958 --> 11:34.745
Nikkei will be open in thirty seconds.

11:34.748 --> 11:36.543
Does anyone know where the master
file is?

11:36.544 --> 11:37.553
I do.

11:39.618 --> 11:40.761
It's on the web.

11:42.850 --> 11:44.754
This is mad, gotta stop this.

11:48.321 --> 11:50.730
We've got to ring that opening bell.

11:50.731 --> 11:53.119
How is this happening,
we've got to stop this now.

11:53.127 --> 11:55.657
No, let's just, shut it down.

11:55.660 --> 11:57.973
-Shut it down, NOW!
-Relax.

11:59.182 --> 12:01.144
Relax, it's under control.

12:01.145 --> 12:02.301
Relax?

12:02.303 --> 12:07.133
Our most valuable and most secure
operating system is out there for free.

12:07.134 --> 12:08.595
How am I suppose to explain that?

12:08.596 --> 12:11.957
I donâ€™t' know. Say it was all part of the plan.

12:12.914 --> 12:15.401
A little uh, a little gift
from ENCOM.

12:15.402 --> 12:18.106
Apparently ENCOM technologies is
having some...

12:18.107 --> 12:19.501
-technical difficulties.
-No.

12:51.022 --> 12:52.081
Hey, Dad.

12:52.813 --> 12:54.195
What are you doing?

13:00.093 --> 13:02.273
Guard: Where are you going to run to now?

13:02.274 --> 13:04.169
Now you don't want to do that.

13:04.170 --> 13:06.772
Didn't anyone tell you, stealing is wrong.

13:06.773 --> 13:09.308
Can't steal something that was
designed to be free.

13:09.309 --> 13:10.402
Now I got you.

13:10.403 --> 13:12.697
Don't sweat it, your boss is
okay with it.

13:12.698 --> 13:16.093
-The hell he is.
-Sam: Your boss works for the CEO.

13:16.094 --> 13:17.927
The CEO works for the shareholders.

13:17.928 --> 13:20.169
Now do you know who the
biggest shareholder is?

13:21.479 --> 13:22.720
I don't know, some kid.

13:26.989 --> 13:28.540
You're Mr. Flynn.

13:30.517 --> 13:31.837
Why?

13:32.970 --> 13:34.448
This is your father's company.

13:34.849 --> 13:36.325
Not anymore.

13:36.409 --> 13:38.712
Wha..., hey, hey kid.

13:38.713 --> 13:40.504
No, NOOOOOOO!

13:47.554 --> 13:49.102
Woo, hoo, hoo, hooo.

13:53.678 --> 13:55.222
Yeah!

13:55.801 --> 13:57.342
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:02.339 --> 14:03.353
O...kay.

14:05.670 --> 14:08.762
Hey, there he is, get him.

14:11.107 --> 14:13.675
HEY!
No free rides.

14:13.895 --> 14:15.088
Whoa!

14:15.982 --> 14:18.224
No free Taxi, you pay.

14:33.028 --> 14:35.853
Hold it right there, freeze!

14:38.582 --> 14:41.766
Okay boys, you got me.

14:42.818 --> 14:44.508
Hey.

15:16.219 --> 15:18.499
Enjoy it Marv, you earned it.

15:22.682 --> 15:24.552
Why are you in my apartment, Allen?

15:26.088 --> 15:28.392
You don't answer your phone.

15:31.316 --> 15:32.662
How you been, Sam?

15:32.664 --> 15:36.168
Oh, you know, when I was twelve,
I really appreciated the surrogate father thing.

15:36.169 --> 15:37.507
But come on, Allen.

15:37.510 --> 15:39.740
I got it all under control.

15:39.742 --> 15:42.051
Oh, clearly.

15:42.052 --> 15:43.972
What is it? You want to
help me with my home work?

15:43.973 --> 15:45.525
Like old times, have a catch.

15:47.478 --> 15:51.146
Well you got a, pretty nice view here.

15:53.265 --> 15:56.396
Heard you did a triple axel off
a roof a few hours ago?

15:57.901 --> 15:59.351
Rough landing, huh?

15:59.353 --> 16:00.772
Hmm, could have been worse.

16:00.775 --> 16:04.897
I also thought your message to the
board was very clever.

16:04.898 --> 16:06.210
Oh, you like that?

16:06.211 --> 16:07.827
Well, that was Marv's idea.

16:13.139 --> 16:15.920
Allan, we really gonna do this again?

16:16.710 --> 16:20.010
Do I really look like I'm ready to run a
fortune 500 company?

16:20.494 --> 16:21.496
No.

16:22.091 --> 16:26.311
But truthfully, the companies pretty
happy with where you are.

16:27.209 --> 16:30.235
See that way they can just keep doing
whatever they want.

16:32.041 --> 16:37.324
Well I guess what I find curious is
the crazy charities,

16:37.325 --> 16:39.427
the annual prank on the company.

16:39.428 --> 16:42.391
Sure have an interesting way of being
disinterested, Sam.

16:42.392 --> 16:43.646
Why are you here, Alan?

16:47.352 --> 16:49.216
I was paged last night.

16:49.217 --> 16:51.929
Oh man, still rocking the pager, hey?

16:51.930 --> 16:53.573
Good for you.

16:53.575 --> 16:57.899
Yeah, your Dad once told me I
had to sleep with it, I still do.

16:58.767 --> 17:01.391
Page came from your Dad's office, at the arcade.

17:04.491 --> 17:05.806
So.

17:06.751 --> 17:10.919
So, that numbers been disconnected
for twenty years.

17:12.577 --> 17:16.323
Sam, two nights before he disappeared,
he came to my house.

17:16.324 --> 17:18.211
I've cracked it, he kept saying.

17:18.835 --> 17:21.733
He was talking about genetic algorithms,

17:21.733 --> 17:24.573
Quantum teleportation. He said he was
about to change everything.

17:24.574 --> 17:27.214
Uh, science, medicine, religion.

17:28.371 --> 17:30.139
He wouldn't have left that, Sam.

17:34.176 --> 17:35.679
He wouldn't have left you.

17:35.767 --> 17:39.189
Al, you're the only one who
still believes that.

17:39.190 --> 17:41.788
He's either dead, or chillin' in Costa Rica.

17:42.722 --> 17:44.188
Probably both.

17:45.506 --> 17:46.630
I'm sorry.

17:46.631 --> 17:47.896
I'm tired.

17:47.897 --> 17:49.213
I smell like jail.

17:49.949 --> 17:53.177
Let's just reconvene in another couple
of years, huh? What do you say?

17:58.487 --> 17:59.489
Here.

18:00.770 --> 18:02.648
These are the keys to the arcade.

18:03.976 --> 18:05.843
I haven't gone over there, yet.

18:07.722 --> 18:08.956
I thought you should be the one.

18:08.957 --> 18:11.775
Alan, your acting like I'm going to
find him sitting there working.

18:13.318 --> 18:16.569
Just, "Hey kiddo, lost track of time".

18:20.326 --> 18:21.648
Wouldn't that be something.

18:31.994 --> 18:33.035
What?

19:25.764 --> 19:28.451
(Journey's "Separate Way's" plays)

19:47.482 --> 19:49.747
*Here we stand*

19:51.327 --> 19:59.196
*Worlds apart, hearts broken in two, two, two*

20:02.203 --> 20:04.301
*Sleepless nights*

20:05.790 --> 20:09.630
*Losing ground,
I'm reaching for you,*

20:09.631 --> 20:14.646
*you, you.*

20:14.647 --> 20:18.824
*Feelin' that it's gone*

20:18.824 --> 20:21.435
*Can change your mind*

20:22.140 --> 20:25.688
*If we can't go on*

20:26.393 --> 20:32.407
*To survive the tide,
love divides*

20:32.408 --> 20:36.145
*Someday love will find you*

20:36.147 --> 20:39.845
*Break those chains that bind you.*

20:40.039 --> 20:43.640
*One night will remind you*

20:43.640 --> 20:47.589
*How we touched
And went our separate ways*

20:47.590 --> 20:50.893
*If he ever hurts you*

21:49.400 --> 21:51.020
You son of a gun.

22:32.015 --> 22:33.016
Huh.

22:41.937 --> 22:43.878
Sam: See you got a backdoor.

23:40.701 --> 23:42.339
This isn't happening.

23:59.167 --> 24:00.960
Oh man, this IS happening.

24:12.020 --> 24:13.718
This program has no disk.

24:13.719 --> 24:14.942
Another stray.

24:16.471 --> 24:18.526
Wait, I'm not a program.

24:46.979 --> 24:48.754
He actually did it.

24:52.817 --> 24:54.159
I'm on the grid.

25:04.238 --> 25:06.864
Does the name Kevin Flynn mean
anything to you?

25:07.707 --> 25:09.816
Be quiet if you want to live.

25:10.805 --> 25:14.101
Programs madly chants: Game, games,
the games. Not the games.

25:14.103 --> 25:15.545
What's his problem?

26:08.045 --> 26:09.202
Rectify.

26:12.904 --> 26:14.222
Rectify.

26:16.794 --> 26:20.264
-Games.
-NO!

26:20.265 --> 26:22.276
-Please.
-Rectify.

26:22.277 --> 26:23.913
Look I know you probably get this a lot,

26:23.914 --> 26:25.421
But there's been a big mistake.

26:25.422 --> 26:26.424
Games.

26:27.528 --> 26:29.802
Please, no, no, no.

26:29.802 --> 26:31.248
Whoa, hey!

26:31.657 --> 26:33.397
Erase me!

26:33.952 --> 26:35.145
AHHHHH!

26:38.338 --> 26:39.303
No!

27:22.010 --> 27:24.835
Can somebody tell me what the hell.

27:28.547 --> 27:29.897
Hey, hey!

27:29.898 --> 27:31.144
That's got a zipper.

27:48.736 --> 27:50.423
He is different.

27:58.874 --> 28:00.489
This can't be good.

28:09.939 --> 28:15.518
Attention, program. You will receive
an identity disc.

28:15.574 --> 28:20.160
Everything you do or learn, will
be imprinted on this disc.

28:21.478 --> 28:23.201
If you lose your disc,

28:23.202 --> 28:25.194
or fail to follow commands.

28:25.471 --> 28:29.674
You will be subject to immediate,
deresolution.

28:36.003 --> 28:39.472
Nearly complete. Disc activated and synchronized.

28:39.474 --> 28:41.085
Proceed to games.

28:42.501 --> 28:43.552
Games?

28:47.811 --> 28:49.027
Where you going?

28:56.482 --> 28:58.153
What am I suppose to do?

28:58.918 --> 29:00.077
Survive.

29:34.512 --> 29:37.700
*Techno music blasting*

29:53.121 --> 29:56.338
Combatants, prepare for Disc Wars.

30:34.562 --> 30:36.504
Platform eight.

30:36.780 --> 30:38.960
I have a strange version of you on my shelf.

30:39.207 --> 30:41.819
Combatants 3 and 11.

30:42.281 --> 30:43.728
Disc wars.

30:53.617 --> 30:55.393
He definitely didn't do that.

31:28.185 --> 31:29.196
Damn it.

31:37.176 --> 31:38.755
So that's how it is.

31:56.377 --> 31:58.973
Combatant 11, deresolution.

32:00.009 --> 32:01.094
I won!

32:01.601 --> 32:02.979
Now let me out.

32:03.081 --> 32:06.997
Combatant 3, round one, victory.

32:07.787 --> 32:09.573
No unusual activity on the grid.

32:09.574 --> 32:12.299
Security sweeps and patrols
have been intensified.

32:12.300 --> 32:14.252
Right to par, on schedule.

32:14.255 --> 32:17.871
Your initiate should be fully operational
within twelve cycles.

32:19.326 --> 32:22.420
Perhaps if you were to include me,

32:22.421 --> 32:25.646
in this mission, l could be of
even greater service.

32:25.650 --> 32:30.945
Computer: Combatant's 3, and 7.
Disc wars.

32:34.481 --> 32:35.483
Computer: Initiate

32:39.049 --> 32:40.051
Yeah.

32:41.390 --> 32:42.546
I'm out of this.

32:49.214 --> 32:51.588
Combatant 3, victory.

32:56.202 --> 32:59.025
Combatant 3, violation.

33:00.036 --> 33:03.251
Combatant 6, deresolution.

33:03.480 --> 33:04.795
What is that program?

33:06.579 --> 33:08.171
Combatant three.

33:08.172 --> 33:09.371
Violation.

33:15.489 --> 33:17.285
Initiate final round.

33:21.885 --> 33:24.360
Combatant 3, versus Rinzler.

33:32.631 --> 33:33.910
You've gotta be kidding me.

33:53.820 --> 33:56.233
Aw, come on, is that even legal?

34:08.253 --> 34:09.254
Whoa!

34:17.888 --> 34:18.889
Yeah!

34:29.308 --> 34:31.792
Why do I feel like I just got
dumped on.

34:39.213 --> 34:40.598
Come on, huh?

34:40.599 --> 34:41.533
Come on.

35:34.948 --> 35:36.048
User.

35:47.669 --> 35:50.546
Identify yourself, program.

35:51.532 --> 35:53.533
I'm not a program.

35:59.964 --> 36:01.286
Cloaked man: Identify....

36:03.086 --> 36:04.881
My name is Sam Flynn.

36:09.986 --> 36:11.332
Bring him to me.

36:14.482 --> 36:15.724
Let me go.

36:19.667 --> 36:21.008
Freaks.

36:22.917 --> 36:24.045
Where am I?

36:27.045 --> 36:28.272
Am I on the grid?

36:30.787 --> 36:31.847
Who are you?

36:38.007 --> 36:39.332
Dad.

36:39.749 --> 36:40.956
Sam.

36:40.957 --> 36:44.072
Look at you, man.

36:44.073 --> 36:44.684
Look at the size of you.

36:46.528 --> 36:47.954
How did you get in here?

36:48.634 --> 36:49.920
I got your message.

36:50.681 --> 36:51.621
Oh.

36:51.622 --> 36:52.864
So it's just you?

36:54.306 --> 36:55.340
Yeah.

36:55.341 --> 36:56.825
Just you.

36:57.274 --> 37:01.195
Wow, isn't this something.

37:02.520 --> 37:03.755
Sam: You look the same.

37:03.756 --> 37:06.399
Oh, a lot has happened, Sam.
More than you can imagine.

37:06.400 --> 37:07.418
This.

37:12.198 --> 37:13.874
Kevin: Let's take a look.

37:29.644 --> 37:30.748
Got it.

37:32.823 --> 37:34.569
Hmm, I expected more.

37:37.278 --> 37:39.841
So, you were trapped in here.

37:39.847 --> 37:41.450
That's right.

37:44.904 --> 37:46.250
You're in charge.

37:46.251 --> 37:48.156
Right again.
Two for two.

37:48.764 --> 37:50.638
So, can we just go home now.

37:52.430 --> 37:54.393
Not in the cards.

37:55.760 --> 37:57.299
Not for you.

38:01.067 --> 38:03.304
That's a hell of a way to treat your son.

38:05.785 --> 38:07.192
Oh, that.

38:11.881 --> 38:14.156
I'm not your father, Sam.

38:16.410 --> 38:18.736
But I'm very, very happy to see you.

38:23.201 --> 38:24.512
CLU.

38:27.815 --> 38:29.324
Where is he?

38:29.325 --> 38:30.535
Sam: What'd you do to him?

38:30.556 --> 38:33.360
Same thing I'm going to do to you.

38:34.474 --> 38:35.676
User.

38:57.691 --> 38:59.583
Greetings programs.

39:03.327 --> 39:06.314
Oh what a vocation we have here
before us.

39:07.323 --> 39:11.519
Because, your rumors are true.

39:11.519 --> 39:15.881
We do indeed have in our midst,

39:15.882 --> 39:17.976
a user.

39:20.661 --> 39:23.331
Aaa uuuser.

39:25.777 --> 39:28.075
Jarvis: So, what to do?

39:28.844 --> 39:33.164
What does this User deserve.

39:33.168 --> 39:36.587
Might I suggest perhaps,

39:36.588 --> 39:38.615
the challenge of the grid.

39:42.984 --> 39:47.991
And who best to battle this
senior opponent?

39:49.069 --> 39:53.040
Perhaps one who has some experience
in these matters.

39:56.724 --> 39:58.773
Oh yes, indeed programs.

39:59.454 --> 40:04.617
Your liberator, your luminary.

40:05.003 --> 40:07.773
Your leader and beacon.

40:08.632 --> 40:13.034
The one who vanquished the
tyranny of the user.

40:13.035 --> 40:15.948
Those many cycles before.

40:16.917 --> 40:18.873
I've been waiting a long time for this.

40:19.700 --> 40:22.900
CCCCLLLLLLUUUUU.

40:22.901 --> 40:24.318
You wanna play?

40:24.963 --> 40:25.967
I'll play.

40:32.712 --> 40:34.344
Excellent word, sir.

40:34.577 --> 40:36.912
Were you pleased with my execution?

40:37.397 --> 40:40.276
The crowd seemed quite energized.

40:41.793 --> 40:43.510
It wasn't meant for them.

40:56.713 --> 40:58.057
What's this?

40:58.822 --> 41:00.100
What do I do with this?

41:00.832 --> 41:02.203
I'll give you a hint.

41:03.517 --> 41:05.120
Not that.

41:15.061 --> 41:16.152
Computer: Grid is live.

41:16.153 --> 41:19.091
Computer: Initiate light-cycle battle.

41:35.198 --> 41:36.843
You got no chance, User.

41:36.844 --> 41:39.110
Their bots are faster than ours.
Use the level's.

41:44.807 --> 41:46.277
Now this I can do.

42:19.227 --> 42:20.496
Here we go.

43:16.320 --> 43:17.509
Whoa.

43:27.084 --> 43:29.637
Hoh, oh!

43:30.126 --> 43:31.333
AAAAAH!

43:44.319 --> 43:45.527
Hey.

43:46.495 --> 43:47.795
We gotta work together.

43:47.796 --> 43:48.997
It's the only way.

43:57.900 --> 43:59.823
That's it, you got me.

44:08.260 --> 44:09.291
Boo!

44:12.300 --> 44:13.742
Whoo, hoo hoo, keep out.

44:13.743 --> 44:15.209
Now that's what I'm talking about.

44:16.443 --> 44:17.861
Sam: Another customer.

44:17.862 --> 44:19.004
Let's go.

44:36.516 --> 44:38.131
Hang on buddy, I'm coming.

44:47.786 --> 44:48.888
Come on.

45:01.695 --> 45:03.365
This is it.

45:03.366 --> 45:04.644
Come on.

45:29.578 --> 45:30.585
NO!

45:34.141 --> 45:36.235
Illegal combatant on the grid.

45:36.271 --> 45:37.407
Get in.

45:37.408 --> 45:39.580
Illegal combatant on the grid.

45:39.581 --> 45:40.581
GET IN!

45:46.665 --> 45:49.473
System failure, release Rinzler.

45:49.961 --> 45:51.529
Game on old friend.

46:01.283 --> 46:02.556
Who are you?

46:02.994 --> 46:04.219
Hang on.

46:32.492 --> 46:34.102
Oh man, you can't make that.

46:43.964 --> 46:45.138
Driver: Made it.

46:54.390 --> 46:55.738
I'm, Quorra.

47:01.639 --> 47:02.683
They're turning around.

47:02.714 --> 47:04.046
Not by choice.

47:04.388 --> 47:06.247
Their vehicles aren't designed
to go off grid.

47:06.248 --> 47:08.022
They'll mal-function on this terrian.

47:08.023 --> 47:09.033
What about us?

47:09.034 --> 47:11.056
Hah, obviously not.

47:18.627 --> 47:20.148
Where are you taking me?

47:20.179 --> 47:22.243
Patience, Sam Flynn.

47:22.491 --> 47:25.145
All your questions will be answered soon.

47:33.876 --> 47:35.234
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

48:38.458 --> 48:39.893
Wait here.

48:43.843 --> 48:45.426
Quorra.

48:46.386 --> 48:48.357
I dreamed of Tron.

48:48.362 --> 48:51.271
First time in years.

48:52.278 --> 48:53.381
It's a sign.

48:55.157 --> 48:57.943
A sign my dear friend, is
of a weary soul.

48:59.338 --> 49:01.249
I'm afraid something's happened.

49:01.250 --> 49:02.746
Something has happened.

49:03.701 --> 49:05.061
We have a guest.

49:07.137 --> 49:09.541
There are no guests here.

49:32.955 --> 49:34.824
Sam.

49:36.500 --> 49:37.677
Long time.

49:40.053 --> 49:41.766
You have no idea.

49:48.920 --> 49:51.127
You're, you're here.

49:55.197 --> 49:56.637
You're here.

49:56.638 --> 49:58.770
I'm here.

50:07.830 --> 50:08.831
You're big.

50:10.240 --> 50:11.246
You're.

50:12.942 --> 50:13.945
Old.

50:18.444 --> 50:19.748
How did you get here?

50:20.950 --> 50:22.387
Alan came over.

50:23.595 --> 50:25.051
Really.

50:26.544 --> 50:28.357
He got your page.

50:28.823 --> 50:31.711
I found your office under the arcade.

50:33.309 --> 50:34.435
Page?

50:36.346 --> 50:39.741
Oh, man, of course.

50:43.904 --> 50:46.199
CLU had him on the Light-Cycle grid.

50:46.200 --> 50:47.716
I intervened.

50:49.089 --> 50:50.392
Oh.

50:52.647 --> 50:53.911
Been there soon,

50:53.912 --> 50:55.823
CLU taught them.

51:10.575 --> 51:12.320
He never thought he'd see you again.

51:15.962 --> 51:17.086
Yeah.

51:24.737 --> 51:26.285
Vintage.

51:26.897 --> 51:29.615
Flynn built it many cycles ago for the games.

51:30.248 --> 51:33.027
It doesn't get out as much
as it used to, but.

51:33.028 --> 51:34.954
Still the fastest thing on the grid.

51:59.696 --> 52:00.737
Do you know it?

52:02.010 --> 52:04.691
His patience usually beats out my more,

52:05.211 --> 52:06.680
aggressive strategy.

52:11.418 --> 52:12.934
Flynn shared them with me.

52:13.850 --> 52:14.952
I've read them all.

52:15.701 --> 52:18.470
Wow, you like reading.

52:19.106 --> 52:26.081
Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Lee Chang,
Journey without a goal.

52:27.084 --> 52:28.793
Must have a killer ending.

52:28.795 --> 52:31.492
Flynn is teaching me about the art of the selfless.

52:31.493 --> 52:35.342
About, removing oneself from the equation.

52:36.226 --> 52:37.973
But, between you and me.

52:38.576 --> 52:40.785
Jules Verne is my favorite.

52:42.402 --> 52:43.667
Do you know, Jules Verne?

52:43.668 --> 52:44.928
Sure.

52:44.929 --> 52:46.991
What's he like?

52:57.825 --> 53:00.248
Your move Flynn, come on.

53:01.174 --> 53:02.436
Come on.

53:25.571 --> 53:26.848
How old are you now, Sam?

53:26.849 --> 53:30.190
- Uh,
- You should be 27.

53:30.194 --> 53:32.416
I just turned 27.

53:32.417 --> 53:34.279
Do you attend a college?

53:35.410 --> 53:36.607
Cal-Tech.

53:37.723 --> 53:38.913
Cal-Tech.

53:39.783 --> 53:41.141
My Alma-Mater.

53:41.848 --> 53:42.850
Sam: Yeah.

53:43.119 --> 53:44.595
That's why I dropped out.

53:54.123 --> 53:55.153
Work?

53:55.624 --> 53:59.100
-A job? ENCOM or you, uh...
-No.

54:00.226 --> 54:02.534
I check in once a year.

54:04.465 --> 54:06.740
-Life, girlfriend?
-A dog.

54:07.355 --> 54:08.424
I have one.

54:08.428 --> 54:10.710
A rescue.

54:10.711 --> 54:13.112
Well, dogs uh, dogs are cool.

54:22.640 --> 54:26.360
I'm sure you must have a few questions
of your own, Sam.

54:29.050 --> 54:30.447
Actually, just one.

54:34.070 --> 54:35.921
Why I never came home?

54:39.855 --> 54:42.345
Those nights when I went to the office

54:43.012 --> 54:45.083
I'm sure you figured it out by now,

54:45.084 --> 54:46.085
was to come here.

54:47.484 --> 54:49.569
Moving forward into digital space.

54:49.884 --> 54:51.566
Maybe, still.

54:54.499 --> 54:56.615
But, I also had you.

54:56.871 --> 54:59.524
I had ENCOM, I couldn't be
in your world all the time.

54:59.526 --> 55:02.955
I needed partners.

55:02.956 --> 55:04.160
To help out.

55:04.171 --> 55:07.090
-Tron and CLU.
-That's right.

55:09.364 --> 55:12.579
<i>Tron was created by Alan for the old system.</i>

55:12.960 --> 55:15.011
<i>I brought him here to protect this one.</i>

55:15.501 --> 55:17.207
<i>CLU was my creation.</i>

55:17.514 --> 55:20.116
<i>A program designed to create a perfect world.</i>

55:22.290 --> 55:25.095
We were jammin' man, building utopia.

55:25.458 --> 55:27.769
Hours in here were just minutes back home.

55:28.135 --> 55:30.686
Just when I thought it couldn't get anymore profound.

55:30.936 --> 55:32.812
Something unexpected happened.

55:33.728 --> 55:34.822
The Miracle.

55:35.520 --> 55:36.677
The Miracle.

55:37.620 --> 55:39.140
You remember.

55:40.583 --> 55:42.107
Iso's

55:42.108 --> 55:44.034
Isomorphic Algrarithm's.

55:44.600 --> 55:46.688
A whole new life form.

55:46.784 --> 55:48.415
And you created them?

55:49.265 --> 55:50.265
(Laughs)

55:53.075 --> 55:54.403
No, no.

55:54.404 --> 55:56.107
They manifested.

55:56.530 --> 55:57.917
Like a flame.

55:58.129 --> 56:01.178
They weren't really, really from anywhere.

56:01.179 --> 56:03.622
The conditions were right, and
they came into being.

56:05.048 --> 56:08.981
For centuries we dreamed of
gods, spirits, aliens.

56:08.981 --> 56:11.416
An intelligence beyond our own.

56:11.417 --> 56:12.607
You seeing this?

56:12.608 --> 56:14.643
I found them, in here.

56:15.550 --> 56:17.240
Like flowers in the waste land.

56:20.540 --> 56:22.212
Profoundly naive.

56:23.985 --> 56:26.008
Unimaginably wild.

56:28.881 --> 56:30.547
They were spectacular.

56:31.939 --> 56:34.192
Everything I'd hope to find in the system.

56:34.193 --> 56:37.616
Control, order, perfection. None of it
meant a thing.

56:38.071 --> 56:39.973
But living in a hall of mirrors.

56:40.354 --> 56:41.742
The Iso's.

56:41.902 --> 56:43.262
Shattered.

56:43.262 --> 56:46.736
The possibilities of their root code,
their digital DNA.

56:46.737 --> 56:48.207
Disease?

56:48.208 --> 56:49.515
History!

56:50.340 --> 56:52.955
Science, philosophy, every idea,

56:52.956 --> 56:55.753
man has ever had about the universe
up for grabs.

56:55.753 --> 56:58.632
Bio digital jazz, man.

56:59.702 --> 57:02.814
The Iso's, they were going to
be my gift to the world.

57:03.227 --> 57:04.501
So, what happened?

57:05.794 --> 57:07.138
CLU.

57:07.658 --> 57:09.502
CLU happened.

57:17.039 --> 57:19.434
Kevin: Will you stop worrying about
everything, Tron.

57:19.438 --> 57:22.878
Kevin: Everything is fine,
everythingâ€™s under control.

57:22.881 --> 57:23.951
Flynn!

57:28.402 --> 57:31.028
Am I still to create the perfect system?

57:32.749 --> 57:33.867
Yeah.

57:37.231 --> 57:39.044
Kevin: It was a coup.

57:41.655 --> 57:42.740
Go!

57:56.952 --> 57:58.128
You've been corrupted.

58:08.306 --> 58:11.515
Wait....wait!

58:13.686 --> 58:15.597
Flynn, go!

58:20.215 --> 58:21.217
Yahhh!

58:22.834 --> 58:25.411
Tron, he fought for me.

58:26.428 --> 58:28.448
I never saw him again.

58:30.016 --> 58:31.606
So why don't you fight?

58:32.904 --> 58:33.906
He did.

58:33.914 --> 58:36.086
He fed on my resistance.

58:36.087 --> 58:38.705
The more I fought, the more powerful
it became.

58:39.236 --> 58:41.164
It was impressed with him .

58:42.224 --> 58:46.843
And my miracle? CLU saw the
ISO's as an imperfection.

58:47.611 --> 58:49.267
So he destroyed them.

58:52.805 --> 58:54.110
The purge.

58:55.057 --> 58:56.391
He killed them all?

58:56.791 --> 58:58.549
It was genocide.

59:00.274 --> 59:03.341
I tried to get back. But I couldn't
get to the portal.

59:03.915 --> 59:07.061
It uses massive power. And it can't
stay open forever.

59:08.882 --> 59:13.713
And like a safe. It can only be opened
from the outside.

59:16.208 --> 59:18.280
It closed on me, Sam.

59:19.707 --> 59:21.474
That's why I never came home.

59:29.117 --> 59:32.555
So the portal. It activated when I came in.

59:33.021 --> 59:34.461
So it's open, now.

59:34.462 --> 59:35.512
Not for long.

59:35.513 --> 59:38.149
Only one millicycle, about eight hours.

59:38.150 --> 59:39.422
So, we go now.

59:39.970 --> 59:41.745
Go home. Make a run for it.

59:41.746 --> 59:43.378
-Get you out of here.
-Kevin: Don't rush.

59:43.379 --> 59:46.281
What do you mean, don't rush. The
portal's going to close.

59:47.940 --> 59:49.873
What? What is it?

59:49.875 --> 59:54.150
The moment Flynn is on the grid,
CLU will stop at nothing to obtain his disc.

59:54.151 --> 59:57.579
My disc is everything, Sam.
It's the master key.

59:57.580 --> 59:59.591
The golden ticket, the way out.

01:00:00.612 --> 01:00:02.188
But not just for me.

01:00:02.489 --> 01:00:06.582
-What do you mean?
-Our worlds are more connected
than anyone knows.

01:00:06.583 --> 01:00:08.868
CLU figures if I can be in.

01:00:08.869 --> 01:00:10.257
He can be out?

01:00:10.258 --> 01:00:13.193
With my disc, it's possible.

01:00:13.194 --> 01:00:14.557
And then what?

01:00:15.541 --> 01:00:16.643
Game over.

01:00:17.764 --> 01:00:19.981
The guy doesn't dig imperfection.

01:00:22.325 --> 01:00:24.100
What's more important than
our world?

01:00:26.316 --> 01:00:27.971
I can't let that happen.

01:00:28.238 --> 01:00:29.929
I won't.

01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:31.186
So what'll we do?

01:00:32.317 --> 01:00:33.319
Nothing?

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:35.941
It's amazing how productive doing
nothing can be.

01:00:36.210 --> 01:00:37.882
CLU's planning something.

01:00:37.883 --> 01:00:39.708
We've known that for a while.

01:00:40.304 --> 01:00:43.197
Programs have been disappearing,
there's unrest out there.

01:00:43.198 --> 01:00:48.277
Even revolution. If we sit tight, he might
be brought down from the inside.

01:00:48.674 --> 01:00:52.010
The portal's closing. We can't just sit
around. We have to move now.

01:00:52.011 --> 01:00:53.048
Tell me.

01:00:53.867 --> 01:00:55.112
What brought you here?

01:00:55.183 --> 01:00:56.602
Through the grid.

01:00:57.391 --> 01:00:59.400
Alan got your page.

01:00:59.401 --> 01:01:01.526
I didn't send any page.

01:01:01.527 --> 01:01:05.183
It was CLU. CLU sent that page.

01:01:05.184 --> 01:01:06.486
That's why you're here.

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:09.088
Kevin: This is all his design.

01:01:09.089 --> 01:01:12.096
He wanted a new piece on the board
to change the game.

01:01:12.608 --> 01:01:14.782
With you he got more than he ever dreamed.

01:01:14.783 --> 01:01:17.089
This is precisely what he wants.

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:19.312
Us together, heading for the portal.

01:01:19.997 --> 01:01:21.637
It's his game now.

01:01:22.108 --> 01:01:24.152
The only way to win is not to play.

01:01:26.158 --> 01:01:28.298
Now that's a hell of a way to win.

01:01:28.303 --> 01:01:29.655
But it is a way.

01:01:34.773 --> 01:01:37.147
We can go you home.

01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:39.748
Don't you want that?

01:01:40.899 --> 01:01:44.350
Sometimes life has a way of moving
you past things like wants and hopes.

01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:48.522
That's right, Dad.

01:01:49.708 --> 01:01:51.618
Keep telling yourself that.

01:01:57.713 --> 01:01:58.924
Goodnight, Sam.

01:02:21.795 --> 01:02:24.555
How can he be so afraid
of his own creation?

01:02:24.556 --> 01:02:27.061
I mean, he built CLU.
Why doesn't he just end him.

01:02:28.803 --> 01:02:31.064
He could but it would require reintegration.

01:02:31.065 --> 01:02:32.095
Yeah, all right.

01:02:32.422 --> 01:02:34.602
Flynn would never survive the effect.

01:02:34.603 --> 01:02:36.288
It would mean the end of them both.

01:02:37.528 --> 01:02:39.884
If he refuses to save himself, then I will.

01:02:44.179 --> 01:02:45.180
How?

01:02:46.277 --> 01:02:47.680
I'm going to the portal.

01:02:48.055 --> 01:02:50.450
CLU wants Flynn's disc, not mine.

01:02:50.451 --> 01:02:53.747
I'm going to find Allen and we're going to figure
this thing out from the other side.

01:02:53.748 --> 01:02:58.622
This may be CLU's game here, But in my
world he's gone in one keystroke.

01:02:58.624 --> 01:03:01.327
But I can't do anything unless I
get to the portal.

01:03:03.561 --> 01:03:07.330
My guts tell me that you don't want to be
stuck in this place for eternity.

01:03:10.487 --> 01:03:13.378
I really think you should consider
your father's wisdom.

01:03:15.283 --> 01:03:16.443
I have.

01:04:20.457 --> 01:04:22.321
There's someone I once knew.

01:04:22.644 --> 01:04:25.897
A program named Zuse, who
fought along side the ISO's.

01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:28.921
They say he can get anyone, anywhere.

01:04:30.793 --> 01:04:32.290
How do I find him?

01:04:36.154 --> 01:04:37.629
This is his sector.

01:04:41.354 --> 01:04:43.001
Make it there alive.

01:04:43.002 --> 01:04:44.268
And he'll find you.

01:05:25.199 --> 01:05:28.357
Sam.

01:05:30.018 --> 01:05:31.376
Sam?

01:06:13.417 --> 01:06:15.563
Hey man, it's your lucky day.

01:06:24.193 --> 01:06:25.284
Stop it.

01:06:35.764 --> 01:06:37.200
Sam Flynn.

01:06:38.406 --> 01:06:40.472
-You remember me.
-Yeah.

01:06:40.473 --> 01:06:42.601
You gave me some advice.

01:06:42.602 --> 01:06:43.906
And you followed it.

01:06:44.797 --> 01:06:46.997
Its unfortunate we met the way we did.

01:06:48.863 --> 01:06:50.259
You have a good night.

01:06:50.423 --> 01:06:51.893
You're looking for someone.

01:06:55.322 --> 01:06:56.997
What makes you say that.

01:06:58.144 --> 01:06:59.642
Intuition.

01:07:02.285 --> 01:07:04.711
Sir, sentries downtown,

01:07:04.712 --> 01:07:06.466
recovered Flynn's light cycle.

01:07:07.738 --> 01:07:10.211
They've traced it to it's component of origin.

01:07:35.941 --> 01:07:38.026
Prepare the light-runner Quorra.

01:07:39.792 --> 01:07:41.209
We're going downtown.

01:08:04.265 --> 01:08:06.301
Thank you for bringing my son to me.

01:08:06.607 --> 01:08:10.670
Flynn, you don't need to go. I sent
him to someone we can trust.

01:08:10.671 --> 01:08:12.787
Quorra, there is no choice.

01:08:13.637 --> 01:08:15.529
I won't lose him again.

01:08:17.859 --> 01:08:21.551
Chaos, good news.

01:09:02.604 --> 01:09:04.930
Relax, they're occupied.

01:09:11.904 --> 01:09:13.438
His name is Castor.

01:09:13.439 --> 01:09:16.032
You want to speak to Zuse you're
going to have to go through him.

01:09:16.033 --> 01:09:18.134
Castor: Where is your sense of
humor, my friend?

01:09:18.135 --> 01:09:21.529
Programs are disappearing, Castor. Soon
none of us will be left.

01:09:21.529 --> 01:09:24.660
Zuse can unite the factions,
ferment revolution.

01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:26.692
Well of course Zuse can do these things.

01:09:26.693 --> 01:09:28.358
Grant me an audience.

01:09:28.359 --> 01:09:31.296
Your enthusiasm is intoxicating
my dear bot,

01:09:31.298 --> 01:09:34.131
But Zuse's time is precious.

01:09:34.131 --> 01:09:36.398
We shall see.

01:09:38.305 --> 01:09:40.423
Whispers: I bought your boy, Flynn.

01:09:40.479 --> 01:09:43.161
If you'll excuse me a moment, I have to, uh...

01:09:44.044 --> 01:09:46.448
Attend to something, but have a drink.

01:09:46.823 --> 01:09:49.229
Courtesy of the "End of line" club.

01:09:49.734 --> 01:09:50.835
It is happening.

01:09:50.836 --> 01:09:53.938
Come, away from
these primitive functions.

01:09:55.034 --> 01:09:57.458
The son of Flynn.

01:09:57.459 --> 01:10:00.150
Of all the innumerable possibilities.

01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:02.679
He has to walk into mine.

01:10:03.399 --> 01:10:08.464
Libations, for everybody!

01:10:10.398 --> 01:10:12.159
I'm Castor.

01:10:12.650 --> 01:10:13.982
Your host.

01:10:14.065 --> 01:10:19.315
Provider of any and all entertainment
and diversions.

01:10:19.321 --> 01:10:20.657
At your service.

01:10:23.268 --> 01:10:24.799
I'm looking for Zuse.

01:10:25.406 --> 01:10:26.701
Indeed.

01:10:26.802 --> 01:10:28.309
Many are.

01:10:28.855 --> 01:10:30.240
Where can I find him?

01:10:30.925 --> 01:10:34.922
This pretty miss, is a conversation
best had behind closed doors.

01:10:34.923 --> 01:10:38.010
Perhaps we should retire to
my private lounge.

01:10:40.203 --> 01:10:42.974
Uh, designed it myself, you know.

01:10:42.975 --> 01:10:44.392
It's true.

01:10:44.393 --> 01:10:46.957
I'm stepping away for a moment, boys.

01:10:46.958 --> 01:10:49.174
Change the scheme, alter the mood.

01:10:49.175 --> 01:10:53.641
Electrify the boys and girls,
if you'd be so kind.

01:10:56.583 --> 01:10:57.708
Thank you.

01:10:57.709 --> 01:10:58.920
Gem.

01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:00.474
My name is, Gem.

01:11:42.399 --> 01:11:43.886
Cozy.

01:13:04.406 --> 01:13:07.042
-You are CLU.
-I am CLU.

01:13:07.043 --> 01:13:09.804
You will create the perfect system.

01:13:09.805 --> 01:13:11.875
I will create the perfect system.

01:13:15.837 --> 01:13:18.391
Together we're going to change the world, man.

01:13:45.724 --> 01:13:47.434
Let's move.

01:13:49.193 --> 01:13:53.140
Zuse has been around since the earliest
days of the gaming grid.

01:13:53.492 --> 01:13:57.434
By necessity.
He has to mine all the percentages.

01:13:57.815 --> 01:13:59.273
All the angles.

01:13:59.274 --> 01:14:00.983
So when do I meet him?

01:14:04.110 --> 01:14:06.962
You...just...did.

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:14.295
Zuse: After the purge, I needed
to reinvent myself.

01:14:14.526 --> 01:14:16.556
Self preservation, you understand.

01:14:22.150 --> 01:14:23.167
Now.

01:14:24.564 --> 01:14:27.022
What can I do, for you?

01:14:29.308 --> 01:14:31.210
I need to get to the portal.

01:14:31.671 --> 01:14:33.724
Well, it's closing quickly.

01:14:33.725 --> 01:14:35.272
As I'm sure, you're aware.

01:14:35.712 --> 01:14:37.280
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:39.482
And it's quite the journey.

01:14:40.014 --> 01:14:42.750
Beyond the far reaches of the outlands.

01:14:43.118 --> 01:14:48.563
Your father didn't want any programs,
slipping out accidentally, did he.

01:14:48.730 --> 01:14:49.939
Can you help me?

01:14:50.394 --> 01:14:52.240
Of course.

01:14:53.053 --> 01:14:57.141
But first, as a man who prides himself
on staying well informed.

01:14:57.142 --> 01:14:59.122
I must ask, who sent you my way?

01:15:02.735 --> 01:15:03.878
Her name's, Quorra.

01:15:04.801 --> 01:15:06.799
Said she met you a long time ago.

01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:09.005
Indeed she did.

01:15:10.163 --> 01:15:11.877
Many cycles ago.

01:15:13.052 --> 01:15:14.929
It was a different time.

01:15:15.685 --> 01:15:18.160
But we're not here to relive the past.

01:15:18.161 --> 01:15:19.862
Let's see about your future, shall we?

01:15:19.863 --> 01:15:21.112
Now, we'll have to, uh...

01:15:21.113 --> 01:15:23.933
change your attire, and you'll need
a forged disc.

01:15:23.935 --> 01:15:25.098
Not easy these days, by the way.

01:15:25.099 --> 01:15:28.044
And of course you'll need transport.

01:15:29.103 --> 01:15:31.222
To cross the sea of simulation.

01:15:42.554 --> 01:15:45.212
This is going to be quite a ride.

01:15:57.883 --> 01:16:00.261
I believed in users once before.

01:16:01.328 --> 01:16:03.084
Playing all the angles.

01:16:07.839 --> 01:16:09.451
Revenge!

01:16:17.888 --> 01:16:19.840
The game has changed.

01:16:19.841 --> 01:16:21.456
Son of Flynn!

01:16:31.463 --> 01:16:33.479
Ha, ha, haaa.

01:16:38.322 --> 01:16:39.392
Met your friend.

01:16:39.393 --> 01:16:40.677
He's fantastic.

01:16:40.678 --> 01:16:44.734
Behold, the son of our maker.

01:17:09.263 --> 01:17:10.879
Yeah, yeah.

01:17:12.471 --> 01:17:13.923
Yeah, yeah.

01:17:56.679 --> 01:17:57.857
Let's split, man.

01:18:19.209 --> 01:18:20.336
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:18:38.508 --> 01:18:40.091
Sam: A little help here, maybe.

01:19:02.364 --> 01:19:03.579
Your Disc.

01:19:04.563 --> 01:19:06.115
Dad, it's gone.

01:19:06.918 --> 01:19:08.070
It is.

01:19:10.924 --> 01:19:12.829
I'm sorry, I know I messed up.

01:19:14.712 --> 01:19:16.404
Sam: We can go back, I can go back.

01:19:16.405 --> 01:19:18.024
No, we stay together.

01:19:18.623 --> 01:19:19.752
Dad, I can do this.

01:19:19.753 --> 01:19:21.470
You've done enough all ready.

01:19:27.097 --> 01:19:29.348
Sam, your really---

01:19:31.359 --> 01:19:33.979
You're messin' with my Zen thing, man.

01:19:36.714 --> 01:19:38.012
She's stable.

01:19:39.034 --> 01:19:40.388
So what do we do now?

01:19:40.389 --> 01:19:42.385
I don't know.
Nothing.

01:19:43.441 --> 01:19:44.610
We do nothing.

01:19:45.776 --> 01:19:47.391
We still,

01:19:50.176 --> 01:19:51.369
...wait.

01:19:59.406 --> 01:20:01.239
You ever jump a freight train?

01:20:03.003 --> 01:20:04.003
Huh?

01:20:04.004 --> 01:20:05.391
We do it your way.

01:20:05.392 --> 01:20:07.191
It's a long sprint to the portal.

01:20:07.721 --> 01:20:09.867
If we beat CLU there we have a chance.

01:20:09.868 --> 01:20:11.093
Let's get her out of here.

01:20:29.736 --> 01:20:31.694
This will take us there.

01:20:58.684 --> 01:21:00.043
Is she going to make it?

01:21:00.044 --> 01:21:02.988
I don't know, I gotta identify
the damaged code.

01:21:04.026 --> 01:21:06.867
The sequence on it is just
enormously complex.

01:21:08.824 --> 01:21:09.955
Sam: But didn't you write it?

01:21:09.956 --> 01:21:14.109
(Laughs) Some of it,
the rest of it is just,

01:21:16.095 --> 01:21:17.469
beyond me.

01:21:20.030 --> 01:21:21.674
She's an Iso.

01:21:22.394 --> 01:21:25.006
Yeah, the last Iso.

01:21:26.817 --> 01:21:31.059
All this time you were just, protecting her.

01:21:31.060 --> 01:21:32.870
She's the miracle, man.

01:21:33.185 --> 01:21:35.183
Everything I ever worked for.

01:21:36.388 --> 01:21:39.650
A digital frontier to reshape
the human condition.

01:21:40.972 --> 01:21:43.540
I always thought that was just a plot line.

01:21:44.143 --> 01:21:47.488
In our world, she could change everything.

01:21:54.527 --> 01:21:56.628
Check that out.

01:22:04.314 --> 01:22:06.578
She risked herself for me.

01:22:08.207 --> 01:22:10.207
Some things are worth the risk.

01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:25.655
Look at this.

01:22:28.517 --> 01:22:30.661
Now that is impressive,

01:22:30.662 --> 01:22:33.357
if I do say
so myself, huh?

01:22:34.006 --> 01:22:37.431
Come on, it's going to take a while for
her system to reboot.

01:22:37.564 --> 01:22:39.600
Now it's time for you to tell me a story.

01:22:58.390 --> 01:23:01.029
The boy and Flynn are gone.

01:23:01.030 --> 01:23:04.843
I presume your Excellency, they
perished in the elevator.

01:23:08.434 --> 01:23:09.718
You presume.

01:23:12.007 --> 01:23:13.037
Find them.

01:23:18.004 --> 01:23:20.269
Ice caps are melting,

01:23:20.270 --> 01:23:21.808
War in the middle east.

01:23:21.809 --> 01:23:23.888
Lakers, Celtics, Batman.

01:23:25.545 --> 01:23:28.277
I don't know rich are getting richer.
The poor are getting poorer.

01:23:28.278 --> 01:23:31.444
Cell phones, online dating, Wi-Fi.

01:23:31.445 --> 01:23:32.756
What's Wi-Fi?

01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:35.929
-Wireless sim-linking
-Of Digital devices?

01:23:35.930 --> 01:23:38.499
-Yeah.
-Oh.

01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:40.358
I thought of that when you were five.

01:23:45.649 --> 01:23:47.072
Mom and Dad,

01:23:49.370 --> 01:23:51.433
-I assume let go
-Yeah.

01:23:52.965 --> 01:23:53.966
Oh.

01:23:54.512 --> 01:23:56.611
Back when I was twelve.

01:23:57.415 --> 01:23:59.322
Gram five years later.

01:24:02.837 --> 01:24:04.637
You remember that night.

01:24:05.266 --> 01:24:06.533
When you didn't come home.

01:24:06.913 --> 01:24:09.758
- Well, you said,
- I said I'd show you the grid.

01:24:12.089 --> 01:24:14.154
You should have seen this place
back then.

01:24:15.828 --> 01:24:17.399
Couldn't wait to show it to you.

01:24:19.635 --> 01:24:21.005
The net-way.

01:24:21.007 --> 01:24:23.198
Must have been something,
before CLU screwed it up.

01:24:23.686 --> 01:24:25.352
No, no, he,

01:24:27.008 --> 01:24:28.247
he's me.

01:24:28.248 --> 01:24:29.727
I screwed it up.

01:24:30.923 --> 01:24:33.088
Crazy after perfection.

01:24:35.544 --> 01:24:37.638
Chasing after what was right in front of me.

01:24:39.915 --> 01:24:41.150
Right in front of me.

01:24:43.147 --> 01:24:45.479
Look what you've accomplished.

01:24:46.438 --> 01:24:47.964
It's incredible.

01:24:48.271 --> 01:24:49.272
Sam.

01:24:50.384 --> 01:24:53.535
I'd give it all up for one
more day with you.

01:25:07.376 --> 01:25:08.376
Hey.

01:25:08.377 --> 01:25:10.279
Remember your old Ducati?

01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:14.447
You kidding me. There's not a day goes
by I don't think about that bike.

01:25:14.448 --> 01:25:16.122
Yeah, well. Fixing her up.

01:25:16.123 --> 01:25:18.505
What are you busting my bike?

01:25:18.506 --> 01:25:21.258
Well twenty years in the shed, no
tork, I mean.

01:25:22.106 --> 01:25:23.966
She knew you were her love.

01:25:25.855 --> 01:25:27.069
How's she running?

01:25:27.487 --> 01:25:29.543
Well, when I'm done.

01:25:30.184 --> 01:25:31.555
Better than ever.

01:25:31.557 --> 01:25:34.986
Aw man, I'd like to see that.

01:25:36.649 --> 01:25:37.758
You will.

01:25:41.973 --> 01:25:45.124
Here, she's rebooting, give her this.

01:25:45.125 --> 01:25:49.522
Your old man is going to knock on the sky,
listen for the sound.

01:26:15.117 --> 01:26:20.706
When Flynn entered the space,
ahh, everything changed.

01:26:21.138 --> 01:26:24.061
Zuse: I've never seen anything quite like it.

01:26:25.301 --> 01:26:28.926
The aura was palpable.

01:26:30.552 --> 01:26:31.926
Was it.

01:26:31.928 --> 01:26:35.403
I presume our understanding,

01:26:35.404 --> 01:26:37.199
is still valid.

01:26:38.463 --> 01:26:40.113
Control of the city.

01:26:41.060 --> 01:26:42.830
A sizable request.

01:26:43.118 --> 01:26:44.940
I know. But, uh...

01:26:44.942 --> 01:26:47.020
Seemingly fitting compensation.

01:26:47.029 --> 01:26:49.024
Don't you think?

01:26:50.522 --> 01:26:53.314
How long have you been searching for this?

01:26:53.315 --> 01:26:54.576
Hmm?

01:26:54.577 --> 01:26:58.014
A thousand cycles...huh?

01:26:58.571 --> 01:27:01.913
Just imagine the secrets it holds.

01:27:04.874 --> 01:27:06.378
The master key to any and all,

01:27:06.379 --> 01:27:10.082
riddles of the grid, grid, grid.

01:27:13.369 --> 01:27:15.195
There's something else, too.

01:27:15.196 --> 01:27:16.848
Isn't there?

01:27:16.849 --> 01:27:18.868
I've heard the chatter.

01:27:18.871 --> 01:27:22.711
About this private initiative.

01:27:32.227 --> 01:27:36.423
I realize that our alliance is at times,

01:27:36.424 --> 01:27:37.784
uneasy.

01:27:38.405 --> 01:27:40.146
But always necessary.

01:27:42.005 --> 01:27:43.504
You know you need me.

01:27:43.507 --> 01:27:45.207
Right where I am.

01:27:45.208 --> 01:27:47.070
CLU.

01:27:47.989 --> 01:27:49.737
Of course, you're right.

01:27:49.738 --> 01:27:52.533
You have the drink.

01:28:00.668 --> 01:28:02.329
End of line, man.

01:28:12.246 --> 01:28:13.251
- (Gasps for breath)
-Hey, hey.

01:28:13.252 --> 01:28:15.016
It's okay, we're safe for now.

01:28:15.023 --> 01:28:17.039
We're heading east, towards the portal.

01:28:20.137 --> 01:28:22.141
CLU has the disc.

01:28:23.432 --> 01:28:25.932
Once I get out, I can shut him down.

01:28:28.118 --> 01:28:30.140
I should never have sent you to Zuse.

01:28:30.141 --> 01:28:31.323
It was a mistake.

01:28:31.891 --> 01:28:34.548
It's okay, I made a few myself.

01:28:39.813 --> 01:28:41.191
Where is he?

01:28:41.196 --> 01:28:44.660
I think he's knocking on the sky.

01:28:44.661 --> 01:28:47.521
And listening to the sound.

01:28:48.643 --> 01:28:49.922
Yeah.

01:28:50.772 --> 01:28:52.300
How did you find him?

01:29:02.274 --> 01:29:03.349
It's okay.

01:29:06.253 --> 01:29:07.295
I know.

01:29:12.884 --> 01:29:14.508
It was during the purge.

01:29:16.269 --> 01:29:17.790
CLU was relentless.

01:29:18.846 --> 01:29:21.338
The Black guard were executing
Iso's in the streets.

01:29:23.067 --> 01:29:24.553
Everyone I knew,

01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:25.762
disappeared.

01:29:28.527 --> 01:29:29.950
Then they came for me.

01:29:33.411 --> 01:29:34.545
So I ran.

01:29:36.105 --> 01:29:39.218
As sympathetic programs smuggled
me out of the city.

01:29:39.779 --> 01:29:41.480
but soon they had me surrounded.

01:29:42.386 --> 01:29:43.830
I prepared for the end.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.890
And just as everything was going dark.

01:29:47.165 --> 01:29:48.699
I felt a hand.

01:29:49.051 --> 01:29:50.439
On my shoulder.

01:29:53.118 --> 01:29:54.750
And when I opened my eyes.

01:29:56.561 --> 01:29:58.652
Standing above me,

01:29:59.466 --> 01:30:00.723
was the creator.

01:30:03.508 --> 01:30:04.905
Your father.

01:30:06.679 --> 01:30:08.327
He saved me.

01:30:12.443 --> 01:30:16.506
I guess you could say I'm,
a rescue.

01:30:35.869 --> 01:30:36.966
Sam: Hell of a view.

01:30:36.967 --> 01:30:39.876
It used to let us
know that Flynn was here.

01:30:39.879 --> 01:30:42.649
It became a symbol of something bigger.

01:30:42.650 --> 01:30:46.084
Something, better in this world.

01:30:46.505 --> 01:30:48.725
I've never been this close before.

01:30:50.454 --> 01:30:52.800
It's how I imagined a sunrise to be.

01:30:53.341 --> 01:30:55.285
Ah, trust me. There's no comparison.

01:30:58.768 --> 01:31:00.235
What's it like?

01:31:02.823 --> 01:31:05.276
-The sun?
-Yeah.

01:31:06.353 --> 01:31:07.837
Oh, man.

01:31:10.027 --> 01:31:12.073
I've never had to describe it before.

01:31:14.624 --> 01:31:15.630
Warm.

01:31:17.973 --> 01:31:19.103
Radiant.

01:31:22.303 --> 01:31:23.346
Beautiful.

01:31:49.535 --> 01:31:51.085
Get below.

01:31:51.802 --> 01:31:52.804
MOVE!

01:31:54.458 --> 01:31:55.830
This isn't suppose to be here.

01:32:00.954 --> 01:32:02.168
What happened?

01:32:02.943 --> 01:32:04.597
A new course.

01:32:14.948 --> 01:32:16.463
What is this?

01:32:17.591 --> 01:32:19.573
CLU can't create programs.

01:32:19.574 --> 01:32:22.129
He can only destroy
and repurpose them.

01:32:22.691 --> 01:32:24.511
Repurpose them for what?

01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:37.993
Sam: He's building an army.

01:32:38.549 --> 01:32:39.895
Let's go.

01:33:10.249 --> 01:33:12.282
-Goodbye.
-Quorra!

01:33:12.283 --> 01:33:13.241
Quorra.

01:33:13.245 --> 01:33:14.502
What's she doing?

01:33:14.508 --> 01:33:16.288
Removing herself from the equation.

01:33:34.736 --> 01:33:35.738
Tron.

01:33:37.977 --> 01:33:39.091
He's alive.

01:33:45.281 --> 01:33:47.174
We can't just let her go.

01:33:47.174 --> 01:33:48.240
Sam!

01:33:48.241 --> 01:33:49.581
There's another way.

01:34:03.739 --> 01:34:04.942
Well done sir.

01:34:20.029 --> 01:34:21.652
Have you ever seen anything like it?

01:34:22.774 --> 01:34:24.080
Humbly, sir.

01:34:24.087 --> 01:34:28.837
I know you have greater designs,
then any of us understand.

01:34:30.462 --> 01:34:31.505
What does it do?

01:34:57.038 --> 01:34:59.311
She's going to wind up like one of them.

01:35:00.208 --> 01:35:01.760
Keep moving, Sam.

01:35:04.955 --> 01:35:08.294
(Programs chanting,
CLU, CLU)

01:35:11.964 --> 01:35:15.575
You are a very rare bird, aren't you.

01:35:24.237 --> 01:35:29.843
Where's your disc?
Where is he?

01:35:32.185 --> 01:35:34.484
Must have been so lonely out there.

01:35:36.014 --> 01:35:38.752
Tragic to be the only one.

01:35:40.419 --> 01:35:43.618
I've seen what users are
capable of, CLU.

01:35:44.235 --> 01:35:46.093
You don't belong with them.

01:35:51.417 --> 01:35:54.485
I have something very special
in mind for you.

01:35:57.987 --> 01:35:59.589
Take her upstairs.

01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:01.345
And find them.

01:36:02.659 --> 01:36:06.260
You'll have to excuse me. You arrived
just as I was prepared for the toast.

01:36:22.531 --> 01:36:24.439
CLU begins his speech:
Greetings programs.

01:36:28.462 --> 01:36:32.139
Together we have achieved a
great many things.

01:36:32.174 --> 01:36:35.275
We have created a vast complex system.

01:36:35.762 --> 01:36:37.290
We've maintained it,

01:36:38.177 --> 01:36:39.293
we've improved it.

01:36:40.147 --> 01:36:43.964
We have rid it of its imperfection.

01:36:45.898 --> 01:36:50.705
Not to mention, ridding of the false deity
who sought to enslave us.

01:36:53.012 --> 01:36:55.077
Kevin Flynn!

01:36:56.319 --> 01:36:57.921
Where are you now?

01:37:01.867 --> 01:37:04.268
My fellow programs, let there
be no doubt.

01:37:05.082 --> 01:37:07.707
That our world is a cage no more.

01:37:08.001 --> 01:37:09.596
For at this moment.

01:37:09.730 --> 01:37:14.546
The key to the next frontier is finally
in our possession.

01:37:20.330 --> 01:37:21.408
The disc.

01:37:21.523 --> 01:37:27.829
And unlike our selfish creator who preserved
the privilege of our world only to himself.

01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:31.419
I will make their world open,

01:37:31.420 --> 01:37:34.321
and available to all of us.

01:37:37.162 --> 01:37:38.765
YES!

01:37:38.766 --> 01:37:42.612
To all of us.
(Soldiers cheer)

01:37:50.869 --> 01:37:53.033
Sam: He's taking all of us with him.

01:37:53.268 --> 01:37:54.961
He's figured out how to do it.

01:37:55.018 --> 01:37:57.302
And whatever we find there.

01:37:57.305 --> 01:38:02.584
There our system will grow,
there our system will blossom.

01:38:04.608 --> 01:38:08.833
Do this, prove yourselves,
prove yourself to me.

01:38:08.834 --> 01:38:10.509
Be loyal to me.

01:38:10.510 --> 01:38:13.602
And I will never betray you.

01:38:26.469 --> 01:38:27.899
Dad, we have to get your disc.

01:38:27.981 --> 01:38:29.212
No we gotta get to the portal.

01:38:29.213 --> 01:38:30.806
You shut them down from the outside.

01:38:30.807 --> 01:38:32.958
Even if I make it out you won't last
in here.

01:38:32.959 --> 01:38:34.989
-Quorra won't last..
-I said it will be all right, come on.

01:38:34.990 --> 01:38:36.893
Will you let it go, I'm not
going home without you.

01:38:37.965 --> 01:38:39.096
Sam.

01:38:39.857 --> 01:38:41.189
Same team.

01:38:42.435 --> 01:38:43.573
Remember?

01:38:46.076 --> 01:38:47.840
I was afraid you were going to say that.

01:38:48.791 --> 01:38:51.187
Meet me on the flight deck in five.
And get us some wheels.

01:38:51.188 --> 01:38:53.044
Wheels? What's your plan?

01:38:54.540 --> 01:38:55.557
I'm a user.

01:38:55.705 --> 01:38:57.026
I'll improvise.

01:39:01.535 --> 01:39:04.361
Rid the new system of its imperfections.

01:39:07.505 --> 01:39:08.702
My vision is clear.

01:39:11.937 --> 01:39:15.453
Out there, is a new world!

01:39:16.247 --> 01:39:19.338
Out there is our victory.

01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:22.050
Out there,

01:39:24.030 --> 01:39:25.906
is our destiny.

01:40:10.827 --> 01:40:13.140
Black Guard: Identify yourself, program.

01:40:16.411 --> 01:40:17.694
I'm not a program.

01:40:17.889 --> 01:40:19.568
My name is Sam Flynn.

01:40:43.169 --> 01:40:44.371
Identify yourself.

01:40:44.372 --> 01:40:45.851
I'm taking this vehicle.

01:40:45.852 --> 01:40:47.650
You are not authorized.

01:40:50.174 --> 01:40:51.759
Right away, sir.

01:40:53.267 --> 01:40:55.907
Watch your step please,
as you board the aircraft.

01:41:08.207 --> 01:41:09.472
Down with the users.

01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:19.519
Master key, disengaged.

01:41:20.428 --> 01:41:22.917
Master key, disengaged.

01:41:22.995 --> 01:41:24.281
I came with a girl.

01:41:24.794 --> 01:41:26.837
A program, where is she?

01:41:29.861 --> 01:41:31.404
Sam. GO!

01:41:46.295 --> 01:41:47.647
AAAAH!

01:41:57.610 --> 01:41:58.944
What are you doing here?

01:41:58.945 --> 01:41:59.946
We gotta get to the flight deck.

01:41:59.947 --> 01:42:02.068
But CLU will be here any minute.
We'll never make it.

01:42:02.611 --> 01:42:03.612
Come on.

01:42:09.447 --> 01:42:11.049
Come on, kiddo.

01:42:14.744 --> 01:42:16.797
Radical, man.

01:42:24.807 --> 01:42:25.808
Hurry!

01:42:26.156 --> 01:42:27.157
Made it.

01:42:46.451 --> 01:42:49.498
Try to hold on to this.
You're gonna need it.

01:42:54.751 --> 01:42:56.371
You got this, Quorra.

01:42:56.850 --> 01:42:58.594
It's all in the wrist.

01:43:38.412 --> 01:43:39.973
Death to the user.

01:44:04.594 --> 01:44:06.346
Head towards the light, Quorra.

01:44:08.573 --> 01:44:10.596
Where did you learn that move back there?

01:44:10.597 --> 01:44:12.206
ENCOM tower.

01:44:12.207 --> 01:44:13.445
Couple nights ago.

01:44:15.599 --> 01:44:18.564
ENCOM tower. Huh.

01:44:20.314 --> 01:44:21.508
Light-jets.

01:44:21.879 --> 01:44:23.353
Here they come.

01:44:24.456 --> 01:44:26.899
-Sam, take the turret.
-Huh?

01:44:34.933 --> 01:44:37.074
Oh man, I'm all over this.

01:44:40.611 --> 01:44:43.303
Yeaah!

01:44:51.228 --> 01:44:53.247
Yeah, ha, ha, ha.

01:44:53.248 --> 01:44:54.933
One down, five to go.

01:45:00.593 --> 01:45:02.412
Nice.

01:45:11.011 --> 01:45:12.525
We gotta split them up.

01:45:32.820 --> 01:45:33.822
Come on.

01:45:38.108 --> 01:45:39.604
Have a nice swim.

01:45:46.113 --> 01:45:47.475
You gotta get behind them.

01:45:48.887 --> 01:45:49.889
Waoooo!

01:45:56.153 --> 01:45:58.241
I don't think this is a good idea.

01:45:58.242 --> 01:45:59.478
You're probably right.

01:46:05.654 --> 01:46:06.908
He's gaining on us.

01:46:27.138 --> 01:46:28.139
(Laughs)

01:46:37.406 --> 01:46:38.591
YES!

01:46:50.457 --> 01:46:51.796
It's jammed.

01:46:57.191 --> 01:46:58.501
Tron.

01:46:58.502 --> 01:47:00.449
What have you become?

01:47:05.049 --> 01:47:06.336
Aw, come on.

01:47:09.816 --> 01:47:11.853
Flynn, go!

01:47:16.068 --> 01:47:17.544
Rinzler, take a shot.

01:47:21.292 --> 01:47:22.505
Finish the game.

01:47:30.697 --> 01:47:32.173
Noooooooo!

01:47:45.019 --> 01:47:47.368
I, fight for the users!

01:47:48.226 --> 01:47:49.619
Aaaaaaah!

01:47:57.522 --> 01:47:58.524
That was him.

01:47:58.525 --> 01:47:59.896
It's over.

01:48:00.910 --> 01:48:02.142
It's over!

01:48:04.342 --> 01:48:05.344
Quorra: Waoooo!

01:48:13.478 --> 01:48:16.341
Quorra, there's something
I need you to do.

01:49:05.099 --> 01:49:06.952
Let's get you home, Dad.

01:49:11.221 --> 01:49:12.607
There it is.

01:49:13.065 --> 01:49:14.210
Take her down.

01:49:14.727 --> 01:49:15.828
Hang on.

01:49:15.829 --> 01:49:17.296
This could be rough.

01:50:09.732 --> 01:50:10.941
This is mine.

01:50:17.220 --> 01:50:18.980
Had a feeling you'd be here.

01:50:20.493 --> 01:50:22.890
The cycle's haven't been kind, have they.

01:50:23.308 --> 01:50:25.903
Well, you don't look so bad.

01:50:27.667 --> 01:50:29.201
I did everything.

01:50:29.633 --> 01:50:31.406
Everything you ever asked.

01:50:31.841 --> 01:50:33.057
I know you did.

01:50:33.464 --> 01:50:35.306
I executed the plan.

01:50:36.086 --> 01:50:37.126
As you saw it.

01:50:37.167 --> 01:50:42.411
You, you promised that we would
change the world, together.

01:50:43.198 --> 01:50:44.337
You broke your promise.

01:50:44.338 --> 01:50:46.729
I know, I understand that now.

01:50:46.731 --> 01:50:49.959
I took this system to its maximum potential.

01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:52.262
I created the perfect system.

01:50:52.563 --> 01:50:56.299
The thing about perfection, is
that it's unknowable.

01:50:57.226 --> 01:51:00.827
It's impossible, but it's also right
in front of us all the time.

01:51:02.115 --> 01:51:04.957
You wouldn't know that because
I didn't when I created you.

01:51:07.383 --> 01:51:09.118
I'm sorry, CLU.

01:51:11.306 --> 01:51:12.962
I'm sorry.

01:51:23.665 --> 01:51:24.865
(Grunts)

01:51:36.002 --> 01:51:37.044
Go.

01:51:50.328 --> 01:51:51.348
CLU!

01:51:52.183 --> 01:51:54.078
Remember what you came for.

01:52:08.359 --> 01:52:09.361
DAD!

01:52:09.470 --> 01:52:10.939
CLU: You knew I'd beat you.

01:52:11.394 --> 01:52:13.122
And still you did all this.

01:52:13.123 --> 01:52:14.125
For him.

01:52:20.615 --> 01:52:21.616
No.

01:52:27.518 --> 01:52:28.520
No.

01:52:29.001 --> 01:52:30.212
Why?

01:52:31.464 --> 01:52:32.999
He's my son.

01:52:39.566 --> 01:52:40.847
Gooooo!

01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:47.401
Dad!

01:52:53.557 --> 01:52:56.232
Sam, it's time.

01:52:56.233 --> 01:52:57.234
No!

01:52:57.708 --> 01:52:58.710
Sam.

01:52:59.043 --> 01:53:00.506
It's what he wants.

01:53:02.547 --> 01:53:04.410
I'm not leaving you.

01:53:04.809 --> 01:53:06.220
Take her.

01:53:18.010 --> 01:53:19.477
Yes.

01:53:47.127 --> 01:53:48.377
Goodbye, kiddo.

01:55:33.041 --> 01:55:34.066
Alan.

01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:40.336
You paged me?

01:55:41.501 --> 01:55:42.502
Yeah.

01:55:43.414 --> 01:55:45.488
You jet ENCOM at 8AM.

01:55:48.019 --> 01:55:49.300
What about the board?

01:55:51.341 --> 01:55:52.716
We trim them out.

01:55:55.472 --> 01:55:57.333
I'm taking the company back, Alan.

01:56:02.194 --> 01:56:05.758
Oh, and you were right.

01:56:08.115 --> 01:56:09.209
About what?

01:56:10.742 --> 01:56:12.537
About everything.

01:56:37.182 --> 01:56:38.664
What's next, Sam?

01:56:43.973 --> 01:56:46.613
I guess we're suppose
to change the world.

01:56:51.500 --> 01:56:54.567
Come on, I want to show you something.
