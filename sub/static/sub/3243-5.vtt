00:00.001 --> 00:04.303
   Joshua: <i> In the beginning,</i>
    <i> a star fell from heaven</i>

00:04.305 --> 00:06.372
        <i> And changed us.</i>

00:06.374 --> 00:09.708
         <i> Made us angels</i>
   <i> and gave us a new destiny:</i>

00:09.710 --> 00:13.045
     <i> To stop the apocalypse</i>

00:13.047 --> 00:15.681
     <i> And the devil himself.</i>

00:15.683 --> 00:17.483
    <i> We must pass god's test</i>

00:17.485 --> 00:21.186
       <i> And prove humanity</i>
     <i> is still worth saving.</i>

00:21.188 --> 00:24.123
   <i> For we are the messengers.</i>

00:27.461 --> 00:29.261
<i>Previously on</i> the messengers...

00:29.263 --> 00:32.430
  We need to find and stop the
four horsemen of the apocalypse.

00:32.433 --> 00:36.301
        War, pestilence,
       famine and death.

00:36.303 --> 00:38.203
  Rose: <i> If those four horsemen</i>
 <i> succeed in breaking our seals,</i>

00:38.205 --> 00:40.539
           <i> We can all</i>
    <i> kiss humanity good-bye.</i>

00:41.308 --> 00:42.341
Where is she?

00:42.343 --> 00:43.675
      <i> Where's my daughter?</i>

00:43.677 --> 00:45.444
I'm not going to dad's anymore?

00:45.446 --> 00:46.678
          No, sweetie.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.148
                   What is this?
  Try to see it as a blessing.

00:49.150 --> 00:50.816
Whether the baby's your son

00:50.818 --> 00:52.084
        Or your brother,

00:52.086 --> 00:53.519
He's still family.

00:53.521 --> 00:54.753
        It's over, raul.

00:54.755 --> 00:56.155
     But i love you, gabby.

00:56.157 --> 00:58.690
      And you love your brother.

00:58.692 --> 01:00.759
         You can't have us both.

01:15.176 --> 01:16.308
(chuckles)

01:16.310 --> 01:18.143
All right,
let me get this straight.

01:18.145 --> 01:19.812
Your wife slept with your dad,

01:19.814 --> 01:21.647
And now she's pregnant
with your brother?

01:21.649 --> 01:23.615
(laughs)
         i know, it's messed up.

01:23.617 --> 01:26.518
         But so is sleeping with
            your brother's wife.

01:26.520 --> 01:27.719
(chuckles)

01:27.721 --> 01:29.655
                   Yeah.
Yeah.

01:29.657 --> 01:32.524
How the hell did we wind up
in a soap opera?

01:32.526 --> 01:33.659
                   I don't know.

01:35.396 --> 01:38.163
Here's to forgetting
your past

01:38.165 --> 01:40.199
And looking
towards the future.

01:40.201 --> 01:43.602
       ¶ and i struck out
        down the road ¶

01:43.604 --> 01:46.805
          ¶ with such
     a tedious journey... ¶

01:46.807 --> 01:48.540
(groans)

01:48.542 --> 01:50.709
        I'm not so sure
       about the future.

01:50.711 --> 01:53.846
   I haven't had any visions
         in three days.

01:53.848 --> 01:55.814
  Not to put pressure on you,

01:55.816 --> 01:59.151
  But senator richards is now
   a full-on horseman of war.

01:59.153 --> 02:01.153
 We need to find the second one

02:01.155 --> 02:02.454
       Before another sin
        gets committed.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.856
             Amen.

02:05.826 --> 02:08.293
      I heard you two were here.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.695
                         Rose!

02:09.697 --> 02:11.463
   I know what you're gonna say.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.565
              Beer before liquor
               makes you sicker?

02:13.567 --> 02:14.833
   Preacher man is just stuck

02:14.835 --> 02:16.301
In his own head.
            (grunts)

02:16.303 --> 02:17.803
A little spiritual constipation.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.138
          Hallelujah.

02:19.140 --> 02:20.439
I figured if we tried

02:20.441 --> 02:22.141
To unclog the pipes
a little bit,

02:22.142 --> 02:23.842
Then maybe we'd get
another vision.
       There could be any number

02:23.844 --> 02:25.477
                Of reasons why a
             vision hasn't come.

02:25.479 --> 02:26.645
Like what?
                  Oh, let's see.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.213
               You were betrayed

02:28.215 --> 02:29.681
             By your ex-wife and
              can't forgive her.

02:29.683 --> 02:31.250
       Your father condemned you

02:31.252 --> 02:32.618
         On national television,

02:32.620 --> 02:35.287
           Or none of the above.

02:35.289 --> 02:36.555
So, basically,
you're saying we're screwed.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.257
        I'm saying there's still

02:38.259 --> 02:39.324
          A lot we don't know...

02:42.363 --> 02:43.495
         It's a vision.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.630
      No, it's a blackout.

02:44.632 --> 02:46.465
Well, i'll drink to that.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.943
       (speaking chinese)

03:25.339 --> 03:27.439
              ¶ ¶

03:37.218 --> 03:39.284
            All in.

03:41.388 --> 03:42.854
             Call.

03:50.798 --> 03:52.397
    You can either buy back

03:52.399 --> 03:53.799
Into the game,

03:53.801 --> 03:55.734
      Or fetch me a drink.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.976
I need this wired
into my account.

04:09.383 --> 04:10.849
     It says insufficient funds.

04:10.851 --> 04:12.884
  There must be some mistake.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.021
           I'm sorry.

04:20.694 --> 04:21.994
This can't be right.

04:22.863 --> 04:25.764
      Welcome to abaddon.

04:25.766 --> 04:26.798
    You know what they say.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.000
                  When you fall,

04:28.002 --> 04:29.668
         You fall hard.

04:40.347 --> 04:42.414
  Nice view, madam secretary.

04:43.984 --> 04:46.351
I was wondering
when you'd show up.

04:47.488 --> 04:48.787
     Care for some scotch?

04:50.724 --> 04:53.358
    It is the devil's water,
           after all.

04:53.360 --> 04:56.795
   I believe there's a reason
         to celebrate.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.898
           First your
secretary of defense nomination.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.333
         And second...

05:04.371 --> 05:06.805
        ...Your becoming
      the horseman of war.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.607
           (chuckles)

05:08.609 --> 05:09.975
    I believe they call that
           a twofer.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.310
                      Yes.

05:11.312 --> 05:12.611
                We will not make

05:12.613 --> 05:15.314
        The same mistake
  as those who came before us.

05:15.316 --> 05:17.649
They almost made it all the way
      to the seventh seal.

05:17.651 --> 05:18.950
                        "almost"

05:18.952 --> 05:20.319
        Is for amateurs.

05:20.321 --> 05:21.753
         This time, we're taking

05:21.755 --> 05:22.888
     A different approach.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.489
      You seem confident.

05:25.592 --> 05:27.893
      Now that a seal is broken,

05:27.895 --> 05:29.995
    I have so much clarity.

05:29.997 --> 05:32.698
      I know what we need to do.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.766
And i know who's out to stop us.

05:36.070 --> 05:38.003
          Speaking of,

05:38.005 --> 05:40.572
             How are our friends
                     in houston?

05:40.574 --> 05:42.941
   They're being dealt with.

05:42.943 --> 05:46.044
      It's just gonna take
     a little extra muscle.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.647
  I trust you have someone...

05:48.649 --> 05:50.782
       Specific in mind?

05:50.784 --> 05:53.919
         Let's just say
    by the end of tomorrow,

05:53.921 --> 05:57.756
    There should be one less
   messenger to worry about.

06:09.837 --> 06:11.403
             Erin:
         "is it conrad?

06:11.405 --> 06:12.838
              "no.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.539
         "is it harry?

06:14.541 --> 06:16.408
              "no.

06:16.410 --> 06:18.844
       Perhaps your name
      is rumpelstiltskin."

06:31.658 --> 06:33.558
     Sorry it took so long.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.693
              Shh.

06:34.695 --> 06:36.828
(whispering):
I'm sorry it took so long.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.130
                 Where were you?

06:38.132 --> 06:39.998
Baby-proofing.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.468
Look, i got latches
for all the cabinets.

06:43.470 --> 06:44.970
Bumpers for all the corners.

06:44.972 --> 06:46.705
           (chuckles)

06:46.707 --> 06:48.740
And i got deadbolts
for all the doors.

06:48.742 --> 06:49.975
Ronnie, you know she won't even

06:49.977 --> 06:51.977
        Be able to walk
       for another year.

06:51.978 --> 06:53.978
  I know, but there's no harm
   in planning ahead, right?

06:53.981 --> 06:55.781
           (chuckles)
              no.

06:55.783 --> 06:58.850
Besides, i want to make sure
the two most important people

06:58.852 --> 07:00.519
In my life

07:00.521 --> 07:01.920
Are safe.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.121
Let me see her.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.424
    Just be careful, please.

07:05.426 --> 07:06.858
I got her.
             Okay.

07:10.197 --> 07:13.432
     It's a big, ugly world
    out there, little angel.

07:13.434 --> 07:16.968
     I'm gonna protect you
        from all of it.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.871
              Amy:
       <i> Mom, mom, wake up.</i>

07:19.873 --> 07:21.039
       It's my birthday!

07:21.041 --> 07:23.875
      It's your birthday,
         birthday girl.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.844
Happy birthday. Let's go.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.712
All right,

07:27.714 --> 07:29.181
      Pour those magic chips in,
                    here you go.

07:29.183 --> 07:30.882
                Little bit more.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.684
     (sighs)

07:34.221 --> 07:35.720
                What's all this?

07:35.722 --> 07:36.922
It's my birthday.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.056
         Oh, it's your birthday.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.958
    What are you, like, 16?

07:39.960 --> 07:41.760
No, silly, i'm seven,

07:41.761 --> 07:43.561
And we're gonna do
all my favorite things today.

07:43.564 --> 07:45.897
    Starting with pancakes;
    it's a family tradition.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.165
Then we're gonna go
to the library,

07:47.167 --> 07:48.733
And tonight,
we're gonna have cake.

07:48.735 --> 07:49.901
You want to come?

07:51.839 --> 07:53.939
       I think raul needs
       to rest, sweetie,

07:53.941 --> 07:55.540
           But maybe he can come

07:55.542 --> 07:56.708
    Meet us for cake later.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.645
Happy birthday.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.147
           Thank you.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.648
                      Hey, rose?

08:03.650 --> 08:05.717
                           Yeah?

08:05.718 --> 08:07.785
I thought that i would take amy
to the library today.

08:07.788 --> 08:10.188
 It must be really hard having
 a kid cooped up for this long.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.023
   I'm gonna do some research
 while we're there, maybe find

08:12.025 --> 08:13.825
  Another book on the horsemen
   that we haven't read yet.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.494
Great, just do me a favor

08:15.496 --> 08:16.728
      And don't go alone.

08:16.730 --> 08:17.829
Remember the devil

08:17.831 --> 08:19.197
       Is still out there
        in a human form,

08:19.199 --> 08:21.800
     And he'll do anything
    to get inside our heads.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.068
                 Okay.

08:23.070 --> 08:25.270
         Okay.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.909
        (water running)

08:32.011 --> 08:34.679
           Hey! Don't you knock?

08:34.681 --> 08:36.181
          Sorry, i...

08:36.183 --> 08:38.517
What the hell is wrong with you?

08:38.519 --> 08:40.217
I am so sorry. I guess
i don't know my own strength.

08:40.220 --> 08:43.087
You guys want to walk
to the library for my birthday?

08:43.090 --> 08:44.890
             Sure.
                     Yeah, sure.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.057
             Sure.

08:46.994 --> 08:48.760
         I am so sorry.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.668
News anchor: Days after bravely
   surviving an assassination

08:56.670 --> 08:59.538
            Intended
for the afghani prime minister,

08:59.540 --> 09:01.907
     Senator cindy richards
      is expected to sail

09:01.909 --> 09:04.109
   Right through the senate's
   approval later this week,

09:04.111 --> 09:05.310
    Making her our country's

09:05.312 --> 09:07.679
     First female secretary
          of defense.

09:07.681 --> 09:08.880
                   Great, so the
                 horseman of war

09:08.882 --> 09:10.682
       Now has her finger
      right on the button.

09:10.684 --> 09:11.850
     We're one step closer
          to rapture.

09:11.852 --> 09:12.984
     We've got to stop her.

09:12.986 --> 09:14.586
               Rose: I told you,
                 once a horseman

09:14.588 --> 09:16.588
       Breaks their seal,
     it can't be unbroken.

09:16.590 --> 09:17.689
           We just have to start

09:17.691 --> 09:18.974
   Looking for the next one.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.258
     No, we should at least
       keep tabs on her.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.227
  If we know the four horsemen

09:22.228 --> 09:24.195
     Will eventually unite,
then we need to track the steps

09:24.197 --> 09:25.997
That would bring them together.
  Vera, i admire your spirit,

09:25.999 --> 09:27.732
       But we cannot find
       the next horseman

09:27.734 --> 09:29.251
    Without joshua's vision.

09:29.252 --> 09:30.769
   Well, with all due respect
      to sleeping beauty,

09:30.771 --> 09:32.737
  I'm gonna go do some digging
           on my own.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.139
You know what,
i think i know what

09:34.141 --> 09:35.740
I can do to help
joshua's visions.

09:35.742 --> 09:36.942
                 Whatever it is,
           i don't want to know.

09:36.944 --> 09:38.176
     Hey, time to get up, buddy.

09:38.178 --> 09:39.277
                We're going on a
              little field trip.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.746
I'm telling you,
you need to be patient.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.748
   I'm afraid that's not one
         of my virtues.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.051
         Amen to that.

09:46.987 --> 09:50.355
       (knocking at door)

09:50.357 --> 09:52.023
             I'm about to leave;
                  you got a sec?

09:52.025 --> 09:53.758
       There's something
      i want to give you.

10:02.636 --> 10:04.703
           (clicking)

10:06.773 --> 10:07.772
   You're kidding me, right?

10:07.774 --> 10:09.240
You want to give me

10:09.242 --> 10:11.109
   A pack of smokes and some
  tequila while you're at it?

10:12.679 --> 10:14.913
         I'm protecting the only
           family i've got left.

10:14.915 --> 10:17.248
            If el jefe finds out
           that i'm still alive,

10:17.250 --> 10:20.685
           He's coming after us.

10:20.687 --> 10:23.088
      I need to know that you're
   gonna be safe while i'm gone.

10:23.090 --> 10:24.823
             You know how to use
                   one of these?

10:30.897 --> 10:32.764
     I think i'll be fine.

10:32.766 --> 10:34.766
                   Good.

10:34.768 --> 10:36.267
                   And stay put.

10:36.269 --> 10:37.802
               Don't go anywhere
                till i get back.

10:37.804 --> 10:38.937
             Nadia:
     <i> All i do is stay put.</i>

10:38.939 --> 10:40.705
 <i> Where do you expect me to go?</i>

10:40.707 --> 10:41.773
           <i> Magicland?</i>

10:43.243 --> 10:44.309
             What?

10:45.912 --> 10:47.245
                        Nothing.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.052
      (children laughing)

10:55.922 --> 10:57.255
                    Amy:
                We're here!

10:57.257 --> 10:58.723
   Ready to read,
   birthday girl?
       Let's get down...

10:58.725 --> 11:00.091
                       Yeah!

11:00.093 --> 11:01.292
Whoa...

11:10.103 --> 11:11.236
    What are you looking at?

11:11.238 --> 11:12.303
Peter:
Nothing.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.852
              ¶ ¶

11:45.706 --> 11:46.805
            Joshua:
        Who is this guy?

11:46.807 --> 11:47.973
He's a spiritual shaman.

11:47.974 --> 11:49.140
Somebody who can
open up your channels.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.209
You're late, garcia.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.277
                         My bad,
                          coach.

11:52.279 --> 11:53.378
     You're not exactly in

11:53.380 --> 11:54.946
 The center of town these days.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.748
You know this is only legal
on reservation land.

11:56.750 --> 11:57.849
      Wise guy.

11:57.851 --> 11:59.851
            (laughs)

11:59.853 --> 12:02.287
Mr. Dakota was also my
high school football coach.

12:02.289 --> 12:03.188
Retired, now.

12:03.190 --> 12:05.156
You got any
history of, uh,

12:05.158 --> 12:06.825
      High blood pressure
       or heart disease?

12:07.894 --> 12:09.227
                        No. Why?

12:09.229 --> 12:10.762
Don't want you
keeling over

12:10.764 --> 12:12.363
After you take this.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.365
                         Peyote?

12:14.367 --> 12:16.334
Raul says you're
stuck in your head

12:16.336 --> 12:19.504
And this is one of
the best ways to get out.

12:19.506 --> 12:20.438
        But don't worry.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.140
  You're, uh, not going alone.

12:22.142 --> 12:23.908
I gotta sit this one out, coach.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.276
You know better
than that.

12:25.278 --> 12:26.377
     The bigger the tribe,

12:26.379 --> 12:28.046
The easier it is
to call on the spirits.

12:28.982 --> 12:30.181
  How do i know this'll work?

12:30.183 --> 12:32.017
Dakota:
You don't.

12:32.018 --> 12:33.852
     Sometimes the only way
   to catch the great spirit

12:33.854 --> 12:36.221
                     Is to throw
                    a hail mary.

12:43.196 --> 12:45.163
          What's this?

12:45.165 --> 12:46.297
  A list of possible horsemen.

12:46.299 --> 12:48.299
      Vera, you're wasting
          your time...

12:48.301 --> 12:49.801
         Just humor me.

12:49.802 --> 12:51.302
      Listen, even before
   she broke the first seal,

12:51.304 --> 12:52.470
 The senator was linked to war.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.773
So i figured
we just need to find

12:54.775 --> 12:56.275
The real-life equivalents

12:56.276 --> 12:57.776
For the horsemen of pestilence,
       famine and death.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.778
   And those are listed here?
Yes.

12:59.780 --> 13:02.547
   So i did a little homework
     on apocalyptic events.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.215
Uh, you know,
disease, crop failure...

13:04.217 --> 13:05.950
Any place where
lots of deaths were occurring.

13:05.952 --> 13:08.386
And based on
my analysis of that,

13:08.388 --> 13:09.988
I pinpointed people who
might be responsible for it.

13:09.990 --> 13:13.258
Um, any one of
these epidemiologists

13:13.260 --> 13:15.493
Could be pestilence.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.529
Uh, and then for famine,
uh, you know,

13:17.531 --> 13:19.564
We're looking
at agricultural companies.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.933
      And death... Well...

13:21.935 --> 13:23.268
                           Vera,

13:23.270 --> 13:25.303
        Before my coma,
     i was a lot like you.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.405
                  I was a nurse,
                      so my life

13:27.407 --> 13:29.574
     Was charts, medicine,
          schedules...

13:29.576 --> 13:32.076
      But after i woke up,
         i realized...

13:32.078 --> 13:33.912
  I can't control everything.

13:35.048 --> 13:36.181
              But i can at least
                      have faith

13:36.183 --> 13:38.283
        That god's going
      to show us the way.

13:38.285 --> 13:41.486
     I would rather find it
           on my own.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.590
             (screams, whimpers)
please don't

13:45.592 --> 13:47.492
   Give me the crap about how
    they're god's creatures.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.294
      Are you kidding me?
          I hate bugs.

13:49.296 --> 13:50.228
                            Ugh.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.362
Let's go buy some roach killer.

13:51.364 --> 13:52.597
             Oh...

13:52.599 --> 13:54.866
           Mom, it's story time.
                       Can i go?

13:54.868 --> 13:56.551
Yeah, of course.

13:56.552 --> 13:58.235
                    Storyteller:
              "grandmother, what
           large ears you have!"

13:58.238 --> 14:00.839
             "the better to hear
             you with, my dear."

14:00.841 --> 14:04.042
          "oh, grandmother, what
           large eyes you have!"

14:04.044 --> 14:06.978
              "the better to see
             you with, my dear."

14:06.980 --> 14:08.246
               "oh, grandmother,

14:08.248 --> 14:11.115
What large teeth
you have!"

14:11.117 --> 14:12.483
  "the better to devour you!"

14:12.485 --> 14:14.052
      (children shrieking)

14:14.054 --> 14:15.520
           (laughing)

14:15.522 --> 14:18.089
     Welcome to story time.
  We're just getting started.

14:30.237 --> 14:32.070
                           Um...

14:32.072 --> 14:33.271
              I thought you were
          over at the magazines.

14:33.273 --> 14:34.372
They're old.
I got bored.

14:37.477 --> 14:40.044
Okay, seriously,
what is my uncle doing

14:40.046 --> 14:41.412
Hanging out
with you freaks?

14:41.414 --> 14:43.081
I mean,

14:43.083 --> 14:44.515
       Everybody's always
       talking about god

14:44.517 --> 14:46.284
         And the devil
   and the end of the world.

14:46.286 --> 14:47.485
What?
Are you guys

14:47.487 --> 14:48.620
     In some kind of cult?

14:48.622 --> 14:50.521
                    I can't say.

14:50.523 --> 14:53.024
      Okay? It's private.

14:53.026 --> 14:55.293
 You saw me naked this morning.

14:55.295 --> 14:57.428
You wouldn't believe it anyway.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.297
            Try me.

15:01.968 --> 15:04.335
                      Okay.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.204
        We're the angels
       of the apocalypse

15:06.206 --> 15:08.039
   And we've each been given
         gifts from god

15:08.041 --> 15:10.308
   To stop the four horsemen
          from uniting

15:10.310 --> 15:12.310
    And causing the rapture.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.045
   And i'm the easter bunny,

15:14.047 --> 15:15.113
            You ass.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.061
   (child shrieks in delight)

15:30.063 --> 15:32.497
          (snippets of
      carnival music play)

15:32.499 --> 15:35.233
 (children shouting, whooping)

15:48.081 --> 15:50.014
                           Erin?

15:50.016 --> 15:51.416
        What are you doing here?

15:51.418 --> 15:52.483
      You brought me here.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.485
                          I did?
    Yeah.

15:54.487 --> 15:55.620
       It's really nice.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.956
Yeah.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.424
 Hey, can i ask you something?

15:59.426 --> 16:01.592
          Yeah, sure.

16:01.594 --> 16:03.328
  When are you gonna kiss me?

16:22.115 --> 16:24.349
                  Gabriela?

16:24.351 --> 16:25.483
Do you remember

16:25.485 --> 16:27.018
       This place, raul?

16:27.020 --> 16:29.454
               Magicland.

16:29.456 --> 16:31.689
  We were here the first time
     you said you loved me.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.224
          I remember.

16:33.226 --> 16:35.193
      I want nadia to know

16:35.195 --> 16:36.561
That kind of happiness.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.296
    She forgot how to smile.

16:38.298 --> 16:40.398
Please, raul,
she's just a kid.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.066
 You've got to help her be one.

16:53.113 --> 16:55.680
         (crow cawing)

17:06.026 --> 17:08.291
          You. I've...
     I've seen you before.

17:08.294 --> 17:09.560
              Yes.

17:09.561 --> 17:11.496
 But i wasn't doing very well.

17:11.498 --> 17:13.263
        Until i saw you.

17:13.266 --> 17:14.699
And now god
is helping me

17:14.701 --> 17:16.434
    See things more clearly.

17:16.435 --> 17:18.136
  But you have to do the same.

17:18.137 --> 17:19.569
I'm sorry, i don't understand...

17:19.571 --> 17:21.172
     Open your eyes, peter.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.241
You, erin,
and all the others...

17:23.242 --> 17:24.809
          Who are you?
    How do you know who we--

17:24.810 --> 17:26.176
         ...You've got
      to follow the signs,

17:26.179 --> 17:28.311
    Just like the messengers
          before you.

17:28.314 --> 17:29.680
Understand?

17:29.682 --> 17:31.449
         Erin. Erin...

17:33.686 --> 17:35.420
             Right?

17:35.422 --> 17:36.487
       Erin (whispering):
          What is it?

17:36.489 --> 17:37.588
You're gonna think
this is weird,

17:37.590 --> 17:39.424
But there's a lady
in this library

17:39.426 --> 17:40.425
Who knows stuff
about us.

17:40.427 --> 17:41.559
        Even our names.

17:41.561 --> 17:42.827
    This is the second time
         i've seen her.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.562
                   Where is she?

17:44.564 --> 17:46.497
She's over here.
                        The man:
         No, that's not a story.

17:46.499 --> 17:49.267
Amy, i'll be
right back, sweetie.

17:49.269 --> 17:50.701
                        The man:
                           So...

17:50.703 --> 17:52.804
      (children laughing)

17:52.806 --> 17:54.839
      I swear she was just here.

17:54.841 --> 17:57.275
                She said we need
            to follow the signs.

17:57.277 --> 17:58.609
What's that supposed to mean?

17:58.611 --> 18:01.779
                 I don't know, i
          barely passed algebra.

18:01.781 --> 18:03.648
Okay, well, if
the lady shows up again,

18:03.650 --> 18:04.749
Find out what she knows.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.250
I gotta get back to amy.

18:06.252 --> 18:07.251
                   Okay.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.420
Okay, sweetie.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.559
Amy?

18:18.731 --> 18:20.231
              Amy?

18:22.102 --> 18:23.167
             Amy?!

18:26.506 --> 18:28.139
              Amy!

18:28.141 --> 18:29.774
              Amy:
        What about mom?

18:35.248 --> 18:37.115
           No! Stop!

18:37.117 --> 18:39.350
              No!

18:39.352 --> 18:40.551
              Amy!

18:45.758 --> 18:47.125
           (gasping)

18:47.127 --> 18:48.459
Excuse me, miss.

18:48.461 --> 18:49.727
Is something wrong?
Can i help?

18:50.730 --> 18:51.729
  He took my daughter, and...

18:51.731 --> 18:53.865
Let me call the police.
                             No!

18:53.867 --> 18:55.600
             Don't.

18:57.437 --> 18:59.470
       Do you have a car?

19:01.774 --> 19:03.374
            The man:
      <i> Why won't you let me</i>
        <i> call the police?</i>

19:03.376 --> 19:05.376
                   What are you,
                         wanted?

19:05.378 --> 19:06.677
          Just drive.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.096
            Please.

19:08.097 --> 19:09.514
The man:
Why did he take
your daughter?

19:11.284 --> 19:13.918
        He's her father.

19:13.920 --> 19:16.487
    Let's just say we're not
     on the best of terms.

19:17.924 --> 19:19.891
            I have a complicated
                    relationship

19:19.893 --> 19:22.393
            With my father, too.

19:22.395 --> 19:23.928
       He was incredibly strict.

19:23.930 --> 19:26.664
                    Controlling.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.367
                        Abusive.

19:29.369 --> 19:32.537
     Even threw me to the ground
              a couple of times.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.872
       And when i asked him why,
          you know what he said?

19:34.874 --> 19:37.642
 He did it because he loved me.

19:37.644 --> 19:39.477
                        (laughs)

19:41.414 --> 19:42.680
Damn it.

19:42.682 --> 19:43.781
We lost them.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.550
         I-i don't see
      their car anywhere.

19:45.552 --> 19:47.552
                      It's okay,
                we'll find them.

19:47.554 --> 19:49.854
        Uh, are there any places
              he might take her?

19:49.856 --> 19:51.289
I don't know.
We... We're not
from around here.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.257
     Look, your daughter's
    probably scared, right?

19:53.259 --> 19:55.093
             So...

19:55.094 --> 19:56.928
    What would he do to make her
      think everything was okay?

19:56.930 --> 19:59.197
               Is there anything
              special she likes?

20:02.769 --> 20:05.670
           Pancakes.

20:05.672 --> 20:08.539
Can i access the nursing part
of your brain for a second?

20:08.541 --> 20:11.409
      I'm a bit rusty, but okay.

20:11.411 --> 20:14.478
The last time i spirit-walked,
when i woke up,

20:14.480 --> 20:16.948
I-i felt winded,
like i couldn't breathe.

20:16.950 --> 20:18.716
           Well, i won't pretend
                   to understand

20:18.718 --> 20:20.752
   How your gift actually works,

20:20.753 --> 20:22.787
    But i do know the body can't
          live without the soul.

20:22.789 --> 20:24.589
And when you worked
at a hospital,

20:24.591 --> 20:25.990
What was the longest
you ever saw

20:25.992 --> 20:27.825
A body dead
before it was resuscitated?

20:27.827 --> 20:29.860
                    Six minutes.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.395
                     After that,
            it's in god's hands.

20:34.267 --> 20:35.366
Whoa.

20:39.472 --> 20:41.839
  That's the second cockroach
        i've seen today.

20:41.841 --> 20:44.575
          You think it's a sign?

20:44.577 --> 20:47.578
Yeah, that there's too many
damn cockroaches in this city.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.485
Joshua sr.:
The baby is your son

20:54.487 --> 20:55.586
        Or your brother,

20:55.588 --> 20:58.522
              He's still family.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.639
                      Charlotte?

21:14.641 --> 21:16.007
    What are you doing here?

21:16.943 --> 21:18.943
        You're bleeding.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.044
Joshua,

21:20.046 --> 21:22.280
Your anger is weighing you down.

21:22.282 --> 21:24.448
This is not
what god wants.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.651
He wants to set you free.

21:26.653 --> 21:29.320
       Unburden yourself.

21:32.525 --> 21:34.592
       (birds screeching)

21:41.834 --> 21:43.901
      Charlotte (echoing):
       <i> Unburden yourself.</i>

21:48.841 --> 21:51.309
Erin:
I don't see his car anywhere.

21:51.311 --> 21:53.711
Maybe he parked it in the back.

21:53.713 --> 21:55.413
     Wait, there they are.

21:55.415 --> 21:57.548
                           Wait!
That's my daughter.

21:57.550 --> 21:59.417
          If you barge in there,
     they'll just call the cops.

21:59.419 --> 22:00.551
 And you don't want that, right?

22:00.553 --> 22:02.553
I can't just sit here
and do nothing.

22:02.555 --> 22:04.789
        I wish there was someone
         we could call for help.

22:04.791 --> 22:06.324
           There is.

22:09.729 --> 22:12.930
     Peter, where are you?

22:20.106 --> 22:22.373
   (beeping, alarm disables)

22:31.818 --> 22:34.518
          What is it,
     a bottle a night now?

22:43.496 --> 22:45.563
Your drinking's out of control,
             erin.

22:45.565 --> 22:48.532
           (sniffles)
         you're the one
     that's out of control.

22:48.534 --> 22:52.803
           You expect us to stay
        here every day, trapped.

22:52.805 --> 22:55.039
                      Amy misses
                    her friends.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.641
       She misses school.

22:57.643 --> 22:58.709
        We can't do this

22:58.711 --> 22:59.977
                          To her
                        anymore.

22:59.979 --> 23:01.412
                 We said we were
          gonna be good parents.

23:01.414 --> 23:04.148
I-i am.
I am.

23:04.150 --> 23:06.884
  Do you know how many school
shootings there were last year?

23:06.886 --> 23:09.720
You know how easy it is
for a child to get abducted,

23:09.722 --> 23:11.088
         To get killed?

23:11.090 --> 23:14.392
     That's why it's better
for you and amy to stay at home

23:14.394 --> 23:15.893
        Where it's safe.
                         Putting
                      dead bolts

23:15.895 --> 23:17.161
      On all of the doors
oh, god,
this...

23:17.163 --> 23:18.929
    And surveillance cameras
         in every room

23:18.931 --> 23:20.664
                    Doesn't make
                        us safe.

23:20.666 --> 23:22.400
                    It's insane.

23:22.402 --> 23:24.902
  Your job makes you paranoid.
No, i-it's

23:24.904 --> 23:25.936
      For your protection.

23:25.938 --> 23:26.904
          From what?!

23:26.906 --> 23:28.406
                    What's wrong
                       with you?

23:28.408 --> 23:31.041
       You're keeping us
     from living our lives!

23:31.043 --> 23:32.410
                       I gave up
                      my career,

23:32.412 --> 23:34.078
    Everything that i knew,

23:34.080 --> 23:37.081
                        To be at
                  home with amy.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.483
 We're prisoners here. I can't

23:39.485 --> 23:41.952
                Take it anymore.
            (shouts)

23:41.954 --> 23:43.154
Don't
you understand

23:43.156 --> 23:45.022
      How much i love you?

23:45.024 --> 23:47.091
(panting)

23:51.164 --> 23:53.564
     I'm tired of running.

23:53.566 --> 23:55.666
    You don't deserve this.

23:55.668 --> 23:57.435
                  It's not fair,

23:57.437 --> 23:59.537
                      For you or
                     your child.

24:02.208 --> 24:05.743
    Fathers can be so cruel.

24:08.681 --> 24:10.648
           You have my word.

24:10.650 --> 24:14.151
            Ronnie will never
            bother you again.

24:16.656 --> 24:19.089
   I never told you his name.

24:19.091 --> 24:21.492
Oh, my god.

24:23.663 --> 24:26.063
      It's you, isn't it?

24:28.100 --> 24:30.734
       Nice to meet you.

24:34.574 --> 24:37.074
Aren't you gonna eat
your pancakes, sweetie?

24:37.076 --> 24:38.809
It's our tradition.

24:38.811 --> 24:41.078
                       I already
                   had pancakes.

24:43.583 --> 24:45.049
              Hey.

24:45.051 --> 24:46.851
       We're going home.

24:46.853 --> 24:48.252
Aren't
you excited?

24:48.254 --> 24:50.154
Get to play
with your own toys,

24:50.156 --> 24:51.622
     Sleep in your own bed.

24:51.624 --> 24:53.023
      It's gonna be great.

24:53.025 --> 24:55.192
        Not without mom.

24:57.163 --> 24:59.163
                         Ronnie:
                 Rise and shine,
                      baby girl!

24:59.165 --> 25:02.833
                   Amy? Sweetie?

25:02.835 --> 25:06.203
           Amy? Erin?

25:08.140 --> 25:10.207
       Where the hell...

25:21.754 --> 25:26.590
 Your mother has taken you away
       from me twice now.

25:26.592 --> 25:28.626
I could
put her in jail.

25:28.628 --> 25:30.261
    She's a bad person, amy.

25:30.263 --> 25:32.563
 No, she's not. She's an angel.

25:32.565 --> 25:33.864
Here's
your check.

25:34.600 --> 25:37.034
      Amy, get back here!

25:37.036 --> 25:38.302
       Why are you here?

25:38.304 --> 25:40.638
          I just came
    to watch the fireworks.

25:44.877 --> 25:47.044
         Amy. Amy, amy.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.779
Get back here.
              Amy?

25:48.781 --> 25:49.613
Amy:
I don't want

25:49.615 --> 25:50.948
         To go home! I want mom!

25:50.950 --> 25:53.050
       We're going home.
Ronnie, give me back
my daughter.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.652
              You lost the right
                to call her that

25:54.654 --> 25:56.153
  When you dragged her halfway
      across the country.

25:56.155 --> 25:57.154
              Mom!
Get away from her.

25:57.155 --> 25:58.154
           Ronnie...
               You know how easy

25:58.157 --> 25:59.723
I can throw your ass
in jail?

25:59.725 --> 26:01.325
             Stay away from her!

26:02.194 --> 26:03.327
              Mom!
Sweetie.

26:03.329 --> 26:04.995
         Amy, sweetie,
     unlock the door, baby.

26:04.997 --> 26:06.931
   He locked it from inside!

26:06.933 --> 26:08.098
 Amy, get away from that door!

26:08.100 --> 26:09.667
            I can't!
Damn it.

26:09.669 --> 26:10.802
  Get away from the door, amy!
                      It's gonna
                        be okay.

26:10.803 --> 26:11.936
       Okay, sweetie? It's gonna
           be all right. Ronnie,

26:11.938 --> 26:12.736
   Unlock the door right now!

26:12.738 --> 26:13.971
        (engine starts)
              mom!

26:15.341 --> 26:16.206
Ronnie!

26:16.208 --> 26:17.808
       (tires screeching)

26:17.810 --> 26:19.843
      It'll be okay, okay?

26:19.845 --> 26:21.345
                    Ronnie, open
                       the door!

26:21.347 --> 26:23.781
  (tires continue screeching)

26:29.155 --> 26:30.154
         What the hell?

26:33.292 --> 26:34.725
       (screeching stops)

26:35.861 --> 26:36.860
Erin:
No. Peter,
look out!

26:36.862 --> 26:37.761
           (gunshot)
           (screams)

26:44.604 --> 26:47.037
Amy:
Daddy!
Daddy!

26:48.841 --> 26:50.140
Mom, you can't
let him die.

26:50.142 --> 26:52.109
       Help him. Please.

26:52.111 --> 26:55.045
        Hey, it's okay.
      Sweetie, it's okay.

26:56.048 --> 26:57.648
                         Please,
                          daddy.

26:57.650 --> 27:00.050
           Don't die.

27:00.052 --> 27:01.785
             Okay.

27:01.787 --> 27:02.987
           Okay.

27:05.057 --> 27:07.257
           (exhales)

27:11.330 --> 27:14.765
        (gasps, exhales)

27:24.043 --> 27:25.776
            What...

27:25.778 --> 27:27.911
 What the hell did you just do?

27:27.913 --> 27:29.913
              Go.

27:29.915 --> 27:32.149
You can't
hurt us anymore.

27:49.201 --> 27:50.668
          (recorded):
 Hey, you've reached charlotte.

27:50.670 --> 27:52.369
    Please leave a message.

27:52.371 --> 27:54.705
         And god bless.
             (beep)

27:54.707 --> 27:57.875
         Hey. It's me.

27:57.877 --> 28:02.312
      I-i've had some time
      to think and, uh...

28:03.449 --> 28:06.750
  Well, there's too much evil
         in the world.

28:06.752 --> 28:08.752
         Too much hate.

28:08.754 --> 28:11.755
     We'd all be better off
if we just forgave one another.

28:11.757 --> 28:14.191
   So that's why i'm calling.

28:17.329 --> 28:19.730
      (shuddering inhale)

28:19.732 --> 28:23.000
   I forgive you, charlotte.

28:29.041 --> 28:32.242
       Joshua (recorded):
     We'd all be better off
if we just forgave one another.

28:32.244 --> 28:35.145
   So that's why i'm calling.

28:35.147 --> 28:37.047
   I forgive you, charlotte.

28:37.049 --> 28:39.783
             (beep)
       woman (recorded):
        Message deleted.

28:39.785 --> 28:41.852
             (beep)

28:43.956 --> 28:45.956
How'd it go?

28:45.958 --> 28:47.858
           I got the voice mail.

28:47.860 --> 28:49.760
Lucky you.

28:49.762 --> 28:52.029
After all this,

28:52.031 --> 28:54.298
Watch the horseman turn out
to be one of our exes.

28:54.300 --> 28:56.366
              (chuckles, groans)

28:59.972 --> 29:01.371
            (scoffs)

29:18.791 --> 29:19.490
Welcome back, preacher man.

29:19.492 --> 29:20.824
                 (chuckles)

29:20.826 --> 29:22.826
   What'd you see?

29:22.827 --> 29:24.827
             Vera:
 <i> Just my scientific hypothesis,</i>

29:24.830 --> 29:27.998
          But all these roaches,
         i'd say we're being led

29:28.000 --> 29:29.233
 To the horseman of pestilence.

29:29.235 --> 29:30.801
                           Rose?

29:30.803 --> 29:32.402
                           Okay,

29:32.404 --> 29:33.904
    Twice is a coincidence.
          Three times,

29:33.906 --> 29:35.439
   That's definitely a sign.

29:35.441 --> 29:37.274
             Yeah.
        (phone ringing)

29:39.078 --> 29:41.411
               It's josh. Hello?

29:41.413 --> 29:44.014
            Dallas?

29:51.157 --> 29:53.157
             Vera:
 You're sure that the horseman

29:53.159 --> 29:54.825
    Is the garreth fletcham?
                  Yeah. You know
                how recognizable

29:54.827 --> 29:56.460
        That psycho is?

29:56.462 --> 29:58.462
     Between ponzi schemes,
         hooker wives,

29:58.464 --> 30:00.998
        And the ability
      to offend everyone,

30:01.000 --> 30:02.366
              He makes the devil
              look like a saint.

30:02.368 --> 30:04.268
     This guy has horseman
     written all over him.

30:04.270 --> 30:05.753
                Rose: And he was
                    just sitting

30:05.754 --> 30:07.237
          At his desk
    looking at his computer?

30:07.239 --> 30:08.305
    There was nothing else?

30:08.307 --> 30:10.207
        No, that was it.

30:10.208 --> 30:12.108
         This vision was totally
  different from all the others.

30:12.111 --> 30:13.961
                 Look, you guys.

30:13.962 --> 30:15.812
 I know i don't have this vision
        thing down to a science.

30:15.815 --> 30:18.849
   But it seemed pretty clear
    that fletcham's our guy.

30:18.851 --> 30:19.917
     I think you're right.

30:19.919 --> 30:21.418
It's no coincidence you called

30:21.420 --> 30:22.820
      Just as we realized
        we were looking

30:22.822 --> 30:24.321
For the horseman of pestilence.

30:24.323 --> 30:26.857
   Okay, but "pestilence" points
         to a plague or a virus.

30:26.859 --> 30:28.225
                    This guy's a
            wealthy businessman.

30:28.227 --> 30:29.526
              I'm sorry, i don't
             see the connection.

30:29.528 --> 30:31.295
We can't waste time
poring over spreadsheets.

30:31.297 --> 30:32.813
We have to get up there.

30:32.814 --> 30:34.330
Fletcham could be
committing a sin at any minute.

30:34.333 --> 30:35.566
Raul:
There's just one problem.

30:35.568 --> 30:37.301
This guy gets
death threats every day.

30:37.303 --> 30:39.269
He's paranoid.
Hardly ever leaves the penthouse

30:39.271 --> 30:40.504
On the 52nd floor.

30:40.506 --> 30:41.939
There's no way
we're gonna get to him.

30:41.941 --> 30:44.608
                 Yeah, there is.

30:44.610 --> 30:46.877
        (elevator dings)

30:53.419 --> 30:55.552
           Fletcham:
    When i say five minutes,

30:55.554 --> 30:57.354
      I mean five minutes!

30:57.356 --> 30:59.890
   Not seven, not six-- five!
        You understand?

30:59.892 --> 31:03.126
   I make more in 60 seconds
 than you'll make in two years!

31:03.128 --> 31:04.561
   What are you waiting for?

31:04.563 --> 31:06.230
This isn't the townsend account!

31:06.232 --> 31:08.198
    It is the jacobson file!
I'm so sorry, sir.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.634
          If you value your job,
    you'll stop wasting my time!

31:10.636 --> 31:14.071
Geez, no wonder
everyone wants you dead.

31:14.073 --> 31:15.572
Exactly what sin are you

31:15.574 --> 31:18.108
         Planning on committing,
                   mr. Horseman.

31:18.110 --> 31:19.643
What if she runs into trouble?

31:19.645 --> 31:21.912
She can take care
of herself... I hope.

31:21.914 --> 31:24.214
She's only got
a few minutes left.

31:29.388 --> 31:32.222
  Wow, that's a lot of zeros.

31:33.959 --> 31:35.993
            (gasps)

31:35.995 --> 31:38.195
        What the hell?!

31:38.197 --> 31:40.197
         Stop! Damn it!

31:40.199 --> 31:41.531
             Stop!

31:41.533 --> 31:42.933
                  It's all gone!

31:42.935 --> 31:45.936
  What the hell is going on?!

31:45.938 --> 31:47.504
       (gasping for air)

31:49.275 --> 31:51.141
She's running out of time.

31:51.143 --> 31:52.676
           (gasping)

31:52.678 --> 31:56.380
      Welcome to abaddon.

32:09.161 --> 32:11.628
           (gasping)

32:11.630 --> 32:13.931
                      (coughing)

32:15.434 --> 32:16.600
         What happened?

32:18.270 --> 32:20.971
  Fletcham's not the horseman.

32:30.215 --> 32:32.015
        Lousy day, huh?

32:32.017 --> 32:33.650
                      (chuckles)
                     believe me.

32:33.652 --> 32:37.621
             I know the feeling.

32:37.623 --> 32:39.623
   You're that bail bondsman.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.358
         What the hell
      are you doing here?

32:41.360 --> 32:45.162
        Whatever i want.

32:50.135 --> 32:53.070
        You said i'd get
       my daughter back.

32:57.710 --> 32:59.710
                And i delivered.

32:59.712 --> 33:02.245
        You on the other hand...
No, you don't get it.

33:02.247 --> 33:04.381
I took a bullet today.

33:07.086 --> 33:09.586
My ex-wife, she saved my life.

33:09.588 --> 33:11.388
            Ronnie?

33:11.390 --> 33:13.991
         (short laugh)

33:13.993 --> 33:16.360
     What a disappointment
     you turned out to be.

33:24.036 --> 33:27.237
             Wait! Please, ju...

33:27.239 --> 33:29.673
  Just give me another chance.

33:29.675 --> 33:33.343
        I'll do anything
       to get them back.

33:33.345 --> 33:35.412
          "anything"?

33:35.414 --> 33:37.614
             Good.

33:37.616 --> 33:39.383
        In that case...

33:39.385 --> 33:41.184
       I'll be in touch.

33:52.398 --> 33:56.033
       ¶ happy birthday ¶

33:56.035 --> 33:59.736
          ¶ to you! ¶

33:59.738 --> 34:02.205
         Oh! Yay, amy!

34:02.207 --> 34:04.574
  Okay, sweetie, make a wish.

34:05.811 --> 34:08.078
         (all cheering)

34:14.286 --> 34:17.286
              I'm sorry, uh, for
          not being there today.

34:17.289 --> 34:19.056
It's okay.

34:19.058 --> 34:20.456
     How are you two holding up?

34:20.458 --> 34:22.458
 I'm still shaken a little bit.

34:22.460 --> 34:24.094
             But...

34:24.096 --> 34:26.429
Amy's so strong,
she never ceases to amaze me.

34:28.199 --> 34:29.766
   She must get it from her mom.

34:29.768 --> 34:32.569
         (quiet laugh)

34:32.571 --> 34:34.438
          Uh, your nose, it's...
       Oh.

34:34.440 --> 34:35.605
                     Here.

34:35.607 --> 34:37.674
            Thanks.

34:38.744 --> 34:40.744
      Probably just the dry air.

34:40.746 --> 34:44.147
  Yeah. Yeah, that must be it.

34:49.353 --> 34:50.420
That's right. Well...

34:50.422 --> 34:52.389
    That is so kind, thank you.

34:52.391 --> 34:53.356
                        (laughs)

34:53.358 --> 34:54.658
      Rude.

34:54.659 --> 34:56.726
                        So rude.

34:57.863 --> 34:59.729
You were right.

34:59.731 --> 35:01.765
I was out just shy
of six minutes.

35:01.767 --> 35:04.401
What's the point of having
a gift with a time limit?

35:04.403 --> 35:05.502
           You're the scientist.

35:05.504 --> 35:07.204
               Got a hypothesis?

35:07.206 --> 35:09.739
Maybe we're not supposed
to just use our gifts.

35:09.741 --> 35:12.175
Maybe we're supposed
to learn something from them.

35:15.314 --> 35:16.880
Are you all right?

35:18.784 --> 35:20.650
                       I'm fine.

35:20.652 --> 35:22.185
                      Why?

35:22.187 --> 35:23.653
         Well, i mean,

35:23.655 --> 35:25.622
  You did shoot someone today.

35:25.624 --> 35:28.391
          I <i> saved</i> someone today.

35:29.361 --> 35:31.228
             Yeah.

35:31.230 --> 35:33.230
          About that.

35:33.232 --> 35:35.198
            Thanks.

35:36.168 --> 35:39.269
         It's all good.

35:39.271 --> 35:41.371
  I guess you weren't kidding
 about being an angel, though.

35:41.373 --> 35:42.906
            (sighs)

35:42.908 --> 35:45.809
            I know.

35:45.811 --> 35:47.744
          It's crazy.

35:49.815 --> 35:53.617
 Actually, it's... Pretty cool.

35:57.356 --> 35:59.523
              Hey.

36:00.826 --> 36:03.160
     Um, i thought you two

36:03.162 --> 36:04.694
               Might like these.

36:04.696 --> 36:07.430
     Tickets to magicland.

36:07.432 --> 36:09.766
             Raul:
  Yeah, it's an amusement park
          across town.

36:09.768 --> 36:11.535
 So when things settle down...

36:13.305 --> 36:16.673
    ...You two should... Go.

36:20.445 --> 36:22.412
    Why are you doing this?

36:27.819 --> 36:30.620
                Look...

36:30.622 --> 36:33.690
           What happened between
           your mother and me...

36:34.826 --> 36:36.760
                ...It was wrong.

36:39.531 --> 36:44.234
   But i want you to know...

36:44.236 --> 36:46.203
       That i loved her.

36:46.205 --> 36:49.606
          She's important to me.

36:51.443 --> 36:53.643
                     So are you.

37:02.921 --> 37:05.922
  You know those gifts from god
       you told me about?

37:05.924 --> 37:07.390
Yeah.

37:07.392 --> 37:09.526
                     What's his?

37:09.528 --> 37:10.727
        He reads minds.

37:21.306 --> 37:22.706
           Excuse me. Excuse me.

37:22.708 --> 37:24.241
         I'm late for my flight.

37:24.243 --> 37:25.842
Oh, sorry.

37:28.513 --> 37:30.580
Travel documents, please.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.867
(men speaking low, indistinctly)

38:06.818 --> 38:08.652
        So we're clear,

38:08.653 --> 38:10.487
    No more talking to dark,
   handsome men with accents.

38:10.489 --> 38:13.657
Yeah, i think i'm just going
to swear off men altogether.

38:13.659 --> 38:14.924
   The devil keeps pretending
         to offer help.

38:14.926 --> 38:16.593
    What's he really after?

38:16.595 --> 38:18.395
        He wants to stop us from
           finding the horsemen.

38:18.397 --> 38:19.929
    And just because we know
       what he looks like

38:19.931 --> 38:21.498
  Doesn't mean he can't still
           get to us,

38:21.500 --> 38:23.800
    So keep your eyes open.

38:23.802 --> 38:25.702
                    But not just
                  for the devil.

38:25.704 --> 38:28.004
            We saw signs all day
             pointing us to this

38:28.006 --> 38:29.773
    Anarchist hacker group.

38:29.775 --> 38:31.408
 They call themselves abaddon.

38:31.410 --> 38:33.710
In the last day, they've hacked
into three major banks,

38:33.712 --> 38:35.478
Stripping all their assets
and wiping them out.

38:35.480 --> 38:36.946
       Just like a virus.

38:36.948 --> 38:38.315
I think whoever's behind abaddon

38:38.317 --> 38:39.749
     Could be the horseman
         of pestilence.

38:39.751 --> 38:41.551
                The question is,

38:41.553 --> 38:44.354
     What's the sin that's going
       to break the second seal?

38:45.557 --> 38:47.590
  I don't know, but we better
      figure it out fast.

38:47.592 --> 38:49.726
Check what abaddon just posted.

38:51.430 --> 38:53.430
A countdown clock?
               You think abaddon

38:53.432 --> 38:55.332
Is about to make another strike?
                    If they are,

38:55.334 --> 38:57.600
        We have 36 hours
       to figure it out.
