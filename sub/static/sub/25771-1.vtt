<i>On my merry way I'll always think of you</i>

01:55.948 --> 01:58.993
<i>On land or sand or gravel</i>

02:00.578 --> 02:03.080
Focus, everyone, focus!
Listen to each other!

02:03.873 --> 02:06.917
<i>It's more fun with two
It's always me and you</i>

02:07.084 --> 02:09.794
<i>And together we will stay</i>

02:11.130 --> 02:14.300
<i>Through warm or stormy weather</i>

02:14.467 --> 02:16.510
<i>We'll always be together</i>

02:16.677 --> 02:17.595
Concentrate!

02:17.762 --> 02:18.429
<i>Forever</i>

02:18.596 --> 02:22.350
<i>For within my heart
If we should ever part</i>

02:22.516 --> 02:26.145
<i>We'll be never far away from each other</i>

02:26.312 --> 02:27.772
<i>We'll be never far away</i>

02:27.938 --> 02:28.939
What's he doing?

02:29.106 --> 02:30.733
- Big finish!
- That'll do! That'll do!

02:30.900 --> 02:31.859
Please!

02:32.026 --> 02:34.320
I sounded incredible!
Tiggers are excellent singers.

02:35.071 --> 02:36.405
It's lovely having you all here.

02:36.572 --> 02:38.407
Always very moving, that number.

02:38.574 --> 02:41.118
Now, we all know why we're here.

02:41.911 --> 02:43.829
It's a sad day.

02:43.996 --> 02:46.540
But I have asked my friend, Eeyore...

02:46.957 --> 02:48.709
That's me.

02:49.251 --> 02:52.672
I have asked him
to propose a rissolution.

02:52.838 --> 02:54.840
- It's "resolution."
- Yes, that's what I said.

02:55.007 --> 02:57.426
- What's a "rissolution?"
- After the poem, dear.

02:58.427 --> 03:01.472
"Christopher Robin is going.

03:01.639 --> 03:04.600
"At least I think he is.

03:05.351 --> 03:07.937
"Where? Nobody knows.

03:08.104 --> 03:10.648
"But he is going."

03:10.815 --> 03:13.693
I mean, he goes.

03:13.859 --> 03:18.531
"Do we care?
We do. Very much.

03:19.615 --> 03:23.703
"Anyhow, we send our love.

03:23.869 --> 03:24.829
"End."

03:24.995 --> 03:29.291
If anyone wants to clap,
now is the time to do it.

03:29.583 --> 03:31.001
- Yay!
- Wonderful!

03:31.585 --> 03:32.586
Christopher.

03:32.753 --> 03:34.130
There he is! He's here!

03:34.338 --> 03:35.881
That was a lovely poem, Eeyore.

03:36.048 --> 03:37.174
It was nothing.

03:37.341 --> 03:38.426
Oh, sorry.

03:38.592 --> 03:40.136
It's just too bad it's over.

03:40.761 --> 03:44.849
I would've liked it to go on
for a while longer.

03:45.015 --> 03:46.809
Now, now, let's not get carried away there,
Pooh Bear.

03:46.976 --> 03:48.352
That was plenty long enough.

03:48.519 --> 03:50.896
For let's all remember,
I commissioned it.

03:51.063 --> 03:54.316
- Based on an original idea by me.
- Which I suggested.

03:54.483 --> 03:55.568
After I thought of it.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.446
Let's not do this in public, shall we?
You wide-eyed nincompoop.

03:58.612 --> 04:01.991
Christopher Robin, I made you this
sack of Hundred Acre Wood haycorns.

04:03.242 --> 04:04.827
They're my very favorite snack.

04:04.994 --> 04:08.330
Wherever you may go,
they'll remind you of the Hundred Acre Wood.

04:08.497 --> 04:09.540
Thank you, Piglet.

04:09.707 --> 04:11.333
I don't think I'll need any help remembering
the Wood...

04:11.500 --> 04:13.669
but I shall treasure them.

04:13.836 --> 04:15.254
I'm gonna miss you, I am!

04:15.421 --> 04:16.880
I'm gonna miss you too, Tigger.

04:17.214 --> 04:19.675
Now, don't you go
and get all growned up on us!

04:19.841 --> 04:22.887
We shall all miss the lad.

04:23.053 --> 04:24.972
- As my Grandowl Osgood used to say...
- Wow!

04:26.056 --> 04:27.641
What did he used to say?

04:27.808 --> 04:29.393
- I call the cherries.
- Extra cream for me, please.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.437
No, it wasn't that.

04:31.604 --> 04:32.605
Is it a carrot cake?

04:32.772 --> 04:34.064
Larger.

04:34.231 --> 04:35.858
Cake is what Tiggers like best!

04:36.025 --> 04:37.526
I'm gonna go for it.

04:40.029 --> 04:41.739
What is this again?

04:43.282 --> 04:44.867
Cake, cake, cake.
Will you never learn?

04:45.034 --> 04:46.994
I would prefer a lovely, crunchy carrot.

04:47.161 --> 04:48.746
What's wrong with something healthy?

04:48.913 --> 04:51.332
- Good for your teeth.
- Sweets go right to my feets!

04:51.499 --> 04:53.709
- You won't be able to stop me!
- Careful, Tigger.

04:53.876 --> 04:55.377
Bounce
and bounce!

04:55.544 --> 04:56.879
Come on, Roo!
And I'll bounce!

04:57.046 --> 04:58.339
And I'll bounce!
And I'll...

05:10.935 --> 05:12.269
Come on, Pooh.

05:13.729 --> 05:16.148
Where are we going, Christopher Robin?

05:16.607 --> 05:17.983
Nowhere.

05:19.985 --> 05:22.988
One of my favorite places.

05:24.907 --> 05:26.575
Saddle's too tight.

05:28.828 --> 05:31.580
What do you like to do best
in the world, Pooh?

05:34.416 --> 05:35.876
Well...

05:36.043 --> 05:38.671
What I like best...

05:39.046 --> 05:41.799
is me and Piglet...

05:42.633 --> 05:43.634
going to see you...

05:45.553 --> 05:49.598
and you say,
"What about a little something?"

05:49.765 --> 05:51.392
And I say...

05:51.559 --> 05:55.104
"Well, I shouldn't mind
a little something."

05:55.521 --> 05:59.733
And it being a hummy sort of a day outside.

06:01.402 --> 06:03.279
I like that too.

06:03.779 --> 06:06.782
But what I like doing best is nothing.

06:08.033 --> 06:10.160
How do you do nothing?

06:10.703 --> 06:12.162
It's when people call out...

06:12.329 --> 06:14.331
"What are you going to do,
Christopher Robin?"

06:14.498 --> 06:17.710
And you say, "Oh, nothing."
And then you go ahead and do it.

06:18.502 --> 06:19.879
Ah, yes.

06:20.045 --> 06:25.050
Doing nothing often leads
to the very best something.

06:33.434 --> 06:34.560
Pooh.

06:34.727 --> 06:37.104
I'm not going to do nothing anymore.

06:38.647 --> 06:39.857
Never again?

06:40.691 --> 06:43.402
Well, they don't let you
at the boarding school.

06:47.573 --> 06:48.699
Pooh...

06:49.533 --> 06:53.495
When I'm off not doing nothing,
will you come up here sometimes?

06:54.413 --> 06:56.332
Just me?

06:56.498 --> 06:58.542
Where will you be?

06:59.251 --> 07:01.462
I'll be right here.

07:02.171 --> 07:06.842
But what should happen
if you forget about me?

07:08.427 --> 07:12.014
I won't ever forget about you, Pooh.
I promise.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.975
Not even when I'm a hundred.

07:17.686 --> 07:19.605
How old will I be then?

07:21.148 --> 07:22.900
99.

07:24.276 --> 07:26.362
Silly old bear.

07:29.865 --> 07:32.242
99...

07:47.424 --> 07:48.926
Christopher, come on now.

07:49.093 --> 07:51.095
Do hurry up, darling.

07:52.012 --> 07:53.055
Christopher!

07:59.687 --> 08:02.356
Christopher Robin, your mother is in the car!

08:08.946 --> 08:10.531
You take care.

08:13.409 --> 08:14.410
Off you go, young man.

08:39.601 --> 08:40.602
Christopher Robin!

08:44.481 --> 08:46.233
Now concentrate!

09:20.142 --> 09:23.270
You're the man of the house now, dear.

10:04.561 --> 10:05.562
Would you like to sit down?

10:09.691 --> 10:10.692
Thank you.

10:12.861 --> 10:14.238
Cheeky blighter.

10:42.599 --> 10:43.725
Will you write?

10:43.892 --> 10:45.394
Of course, every day.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.126
<i>It's February 11th, 1944.</i>

11:09.293 --> 11:11.837
<i>Soon the nightly battle of London
will be on.</i>

11:12.754 --> 11:16.550
<i>This has been a quiet day for us,
but it won't be a quiet night.</i>

11:16.717 --> 11:20.095
<i>They'll destroy a few buildings,
and kill a few people.</i>

11:20.262 --> 11:21.847
<i>Probably some of the people you...</i>

11:24.892 --> 11:30.606
<i>Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Madeline</i>

11:31.356 --> 11:33.734
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

11:42.409 --> 11:43.702
This is Zebra-One-Charlie!

11:44.661 --> 11:46.079
This is Zebra-One-Charlie.

11:47.206 --> 11:49.166
Where are my reinforcements?

11:49.750 --> 11:50.751
Well done.

11:51.210 --> 11:54.171
Mummy, when is Daddy coming home?

12:19.029 --> 12:20.489
This is your daddy.

13:00.737 --> 13:02.698
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

13:03.282 --> 13:05.450
- Good morning, Mr. Robin.
- Good morning, Ms. Dane.

13:05.617 --> 13:07.452
- Did you have a pleasant...
- I'd like them to reconsider...

13:07.619 --> 13:10.789
the brass fittings on the chestnut wardrobes
for nickel-plated ones.

13:10.956 --> 13:13.125
- I'll make a note of that.
- Now, what's the holdup from Glasgow?

13:13.292 --> 13:15.627
- Tanners union dispute, sir.
- What about Manchester?

13:15.794 --> 13:18.171
- Waiting on fabric, sir.
- And what's Birmingham's excuse?

13:18.755 --> 13:20.340
It's just Birmingham, sir.
They're always late.

13:20.507 --> 13:23.969
I don't need to remind you,
we're under increasing pressure to cut costs!

13:24.136 --> 13:25.220
- Mr. Robin?
- Yes.

13:25.929 --> 13:28.890
If we replace the second inner bevel
with beechwood...

13:29.057 --> 13:31.268
we can increase buoyancy by four percent.

13:31.435 --> 13:33.437
And decrease weight by point-two percent.

13:33.603 --> 13:34.604
And cost?

13:35.355 --> 13:37.149
Well, it might save a few pennies.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.484
Keep plugging away, everyone.

13:39.651 --> 13:41.069
Bravo! That's what we like to hear.

13:42.362 --> 13:44.573
Mr. Winslow, I could easily have come
up to your office.

13:44.740 --> 13:48.827
No, no. I love to come down here,
get my hands dirty once in a while.

13:48.994 --> 13:51.455
Oh sir, that sample is, in fact, still wet.

13:51.621 --> 13:54.207
Yes. The smell of the leather.

13:54.374 --> 13:55.876
The smell of hard work.

13:56.043 --> 14:00.589
Much rather be here than in my stuffy office
where the boring stuff happens.

14:00.756 --> 14:01.965
Yawn.

14:05.218 --> 14:08.305
This is where I belong.
Down here with the real men.

14:08.472 --> 14:10.057
And women.

14:10.223 --> 14:12.184
Sorry, always forget about them.

14:12.351 --> 14:14.519
Yes, I hate offices.

14:14.686 --> 14:17.105
Give me some manual labor any day of the...

14:20.692 --> 14:22.444
Let's go into your office.

14:23.111 --> 14:24.571
Yes, Mr. Winslow.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.324
- After you, sir.
- Oh, no, please.

14:29.576 --> 14:31.119
Carry on.

14:35.123 --> 14:37.417
I spent all morning on that.

14:37.834 --> 14:41.546
Of all my father's businesses,
Winslow Luggage is the worst.

14:41.713 --> 14:44.591
Embarrassing for me, of course,
but hardly surprising.

14:44.758 --> 14:45.967
There's been a war.

14:46.760 --> 14:49.346
Who has the time or the money
to go on holiday these days?

14:50.680 --> 14:54.101
In short, we need to cut some costs.

14:54.267 --> 14:56.812
That's all I've been working on, sir.
We've made some progress.

14:58.730 --> 15:00.607
Three percent, or thereabouts.

15:00.774 --> 15:03.276
We need to cut deeper
than three percent, Robin.

15:03.443 --> 15:05.153
- We're stuffed.
- What did they say?

15:05.737 --> 15:07.697
- I can't hear.
- Don't worry.

15:08.281 --> 15:09.699
I can lip read.

15:09.866 --> 15:11.159
How much deeper, sir?

15:11.326 --> 15:13.703
- Twenty.
- Twenty!

15:14.162 --> 15:16.540
Twenty percent, that's impossible.

15:16.706 --> 15:18.917
He's saying,
"Windy tent. That's an apple."

15:19.084 --> 15:20.502
What are they talking about?

15:20.669 --> 15:21.795
Perhaps it's a lunch order.

15:21.962 --> 15:26.425
Sir, your father promised these people
good jobs to come home to after the war.

15:26.591 --> 15:28.176
Well, they'd do anything
for this company.

15:28.343 --> 15:30.429
I'd do anything for this company.

15:31.179 --> 15:34.724
My father has called
an emergency meeting on Monday.

15:34.891 --> 15:37.644
We need to produce the cuts by then.

15:37.811 --> 15:39.438
It's sink or swim.

15:39.604 --> 15:43.066
I promised my wife and daughter
I'd take them away this weekend, sir.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.736
I thought you'd do anything for this company.

15:50.031 --> 15:51.950
Do you have dreams, Robin?

15:52.617 --> 15:53.910
I beg your pardon, sir?

15:54.077 --> 15:55.996
Well, I'll let you into a little secret.

15:56.163 --> 15:57.831
Dreams don't come for free, Robin.

15:57.998 --> 16:00.125
Nothing comes from nothing.

16:00.292 --> 16:03.879
And if this ship goes down, you need
to ask yourself the question...

16:04.045 --> 16:06.882
"Am I a swimmer, or am I a sinker?"

16:09.092 --> 16:10.969
Well, which one are you, Robin?

16:12.929 --> 16:15.265
Well, obviously I'd like to reply
that I'm a swimmer, sir.

16:15.432 --> 16:16.975
Right answer! Me too.

16:17.142 --> 16:20.395
That's why I shall be working
this weekend, also.

16:20.562 --> 16:22.647
All hands on deck and all that.

16:23.273 --> 16:25.233
This may help,
a list here of names.

16:25.400 --> 16:28.153
People who can walk the plank if you...

16:29.613 --> 16:32.491
if we don't come up with something.

16:33.241 --> 16:34.451
It's all on you, Robin.

16:39.915 --> 16:41.541
Oh, good heavens.

16:43.585 --> 16:45.545
Keep up the good work.

17:16.535 --> 17:17.577
Christopher.

17:17.743 --> 17:19.788
- All work and no play, eh?
- Cecil.

17:19.996 --> 17:23.083
Speaking of play,
the wife and I were just talking...

17:23.250 --> 17:25.502
and hate to be a persistent Peter...

17:25.669 --> 17:28.255
but we're still waiting
for that gin rummy game.

17:29.089 --> 17:31.132
Oh, yes, yes!

17:31.299 --> 17:33.552
Well, one of these days, eventually.

17:33.718 --> 17:35.845
Eager to finally see how good you are.

17:48.900 --> 17:51.695
Madeline wanted to wait for you
but it got so late.

17:52.320 --> 17:54.197
Yes, I'm sorry, I got held up at work.

17:54.364 --> 17:56.449
I know. Katherine rang to let me know.

17:56.616 --> 17:58.994
She also said you'd be working this weekend.

17:59.411 --> 18:01.329
I suppose you won't be coming to the cottage.

18:04.249 --> 18:05.625
Well, it can't be helped.

18:06.084 --> 18:07.752
It never can.

18:19.681 --> 18:20.849
Hello.

18:21.016 --> 18:22.809
What've you got there?

18:23.852 --> 18:26.646
It's yours.
I found it in the attic.

18:27.814 --> 18:31.610
It has loads of things
from when you were my age.

18:33.737 --> 18:35.572
Haycorns.

18:35.739 --> 18:37.741
I mean, acorns.

18:39.784 --> 18:40.910
Nothing of any great importance.

18:42.120 --> 18:45.123
Don't you think you should be doing something
more useful with your time?

18:45.290 --> 18:46.333
Reading perhaps?

18:46.499 --> 18:49.085
I've already finished the book list
that Grayford Prep sent.

18:49.252 --> 18:51.963
I'm way ahead.
I've been very efficient.

18:52.130 --> 18:54.507
Good. That's good.

18:54.674 --> 18:57.052
Yes, so there's no work to do this weekend.

18:57.218 --> 18:59.721
We can do whatever we want.
We'll go back to your cottage.

19:00.263 --> 19:01.556
Play where you played.

19:01.723 --> 19:04.934
We can do puzzles, board games.

19:05.101 --> 19:06.102
Right.

19:06.561 --> 19:08.855
I wanted to talk to you about that.

19:11.316 --> 19:13.276
I can't come this weekend.

19:17.614 --> 19:19.324
But summer will be over soon.

19:19.491 --> 19:20.825
I have to stay for work.

19:21.284 --> 19:23.203
You and your mother will go.

19:23.370 --> 19:24.579
I never see you.

19:24.746 --> 19:27.457
Well, I wished I didn't have to stay
for work...

19:28.166 --> 19:30.543
but dreams don't come for free, Madeline.

19:31.002 --> 19:32.504
You have to work for them.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.798
Nothing comes from nothing.

19:34.964 --> 19:36.925
Do you understand?

19:39.135 --> 19:40.804
I understand.

19:42.889 --> 19:45.016
I suppose you can keep these here then.

19:49.062 --> 19:50.605
Yes.

19:53.942 --> 19:57.821
Do you think you could read to me
for a minute?

20:00.407 --> 20:02.200
Of course.

20:03.201 --> 20:04.828
Yes.

20:10.500 --> 20:14.129
"The Victorian Era signified the height
of the Industrial Revolution...

20:14.295 --> 20:17.090
"and was viewed as the apex
of the British Empire."

20:17.257 --> 20:18.967
We've got a real good one here.

20:19.134 --> 20:20.468
"It followed the Georgian period...

20:20.635 --> 20:23.012
"and preceded the Edwardian period."

20:23.179 --> 20:24.222
Actually...

20:25.098 --> 20:26.099
Father.

20:26.266 --> 20:27.267
Yes?

20:27.892 --> 20:29.394
I'm a bit tired.

20:31.688 --> 20:32.897
Right.

20:33.064 --> 20:34.441
Yes.

20:35.108 --> 20:36.109
You sure?

20:40.321 --> 20:41.322
Of course.

20:45.952 --> 20:46.953
Good night.

20:47.662 --> 20:49.247
Good night.

21:03.720 --> 21:04.929
<i>I've been thinking.</i>

21:05.388 --> 21:06.931
You two don't have to go
to the country tomorrow.

21:07.098 --> 21:09.184
We've been over this.
She needs to play, Christopher.

21:09.350 --> 21:11.186
Not spend all of her time studying.

21:11.352 --> 21:13.271
Grayford Prep is the best!

21:13.438 --> 21:14.981
She told me she's done all the reading.

21:15.148 --> 21:16.691
Because she would do anything to please you.

21:17.984 --> 21:19.611
But there are perfectly good schools
here in London...

21:19.778 --> 21:21.529
that don't require us to send her away.

21:21.696 --> 21:24.365
And come on, Christopher.
You know she doesn't want to go.

21:24.532 --> 21:26.326
I went away when I was her age.

21:27.827 --> 21:29.370
It'll prepare her for the real world.

21:29.537 --> 21:31.039
Set her up for a career.

21:31.206 --> 21:32.916
Isn't that our responsibility to her?

21:35.668 --> 21:36.669
What?

21:38.254 --> 21:40.089
Do you even like your job?

21:41.174 --> 21:42.801
What's that got to do with anything?

21:43.843 --> 21:45.720
You're going to hit your limit.

21:45.887 --> 21:47.180
- One day you're going to crack.
- Evelyn.

21:47.931 --> 21:51.810
Look, if I work really hard now,
then in the future...

21:51.976 --> 21:53.019
our life will be...

21:53.186 --> 21:56.022
Will be what?
Will be better? Worse?

21:56.481 --> 21:58.358
We don't care, we want you.

21:58.525 --> 21:59.984
This is life, Christopher.

22:00.151 --> 22:01.528
This weekend is your life.

22:01.694 --> 22:03.321
Your life is happening now.

22:03.488 --> 22:05.365
Right in front of you.

22:05.532 --> 22:07.200
Look. Hello!

22:07.367 --> 22:09.953
Yahoo. Remember me?
I'm your wife.

22:11.454 --> 22:12.997
And that's another thing.

22:13.164 --> 22:15.333
I haven't seen you laugh in years.

22:15.500 --> 22:18.044
- I want to see you have-fun. sometimes.

22:18.211 --> 22:21.381
Be silly. I didn't fall for you
because you had your career set up.

22:29.430 --> 22:31.474
Was it my dancing?

22:32.100 --> 22:35.395
Actually, yes, it was dancing with you.

22:35.562 --> 22:36.980
Being held by you.

22:37.605 --> 22:39.649
Look, don't make this harder on me.

22:39.816 --> 22:41.693
I am sorry.

22:43.319 --> 22:45.947
I'll take my suitcase upstairs.

22:51.995 --> 22:53.663
Where is my suitcase?

22:53.830 --> 22:55.707
I didn't bother packing it.

23:05.967 --> 23:07.468
Have a nice time.

23:08.136 --> 23:08.970
Good bye.

23:09.137 --> 23:10.513
Good bye.

23:17.437 --> 23:19.147
Take care.

23:20.857 --> 23:22.483
See you soon.

23:38.875 --> 23:43.129
We can have that game of gin rummy
now that you're a Tommy-time-on-his-hands.

23:59.604 --> 24:01.189
<i>Dear Father...</i>

24:01.356 --> 24:03.483
<i>I never knew you could draw so well.</i>

24:03.650 --> 24:05.985
<i>Maybe you could hang this one next to mine.</i>

24:06.152 --> 24:08.071
<i>Love, Madeline.</i>

24:38.184 --> 24:39.602
Honey.

24:48.069 --> 24:49.529
Honey!

24:50.029 --> 24:51.531
Where am I?

24:51.698 --> 24:53.700
I can't see anything.

24:54.659 --> 24:56.828
Oh, that's right.

24:59.622 --> 25:01.124
Good morning, house.

25:03.126 --> 25:05.169
How are you today?

25:05.545 --> 25:10.133
Time to make myself hungry
with my stoutness exercise.

25:11.467 --> 25:14.887
<i>When I up, down, touch the ground</i>

25:15.555 --> 25:19.225
<i>It puts me in the mood</i>

25:19.392 --> 25:21.853
<i>When I up, down, turn around</i>

25:22.020 --> 25:27.066
<i>in the mood for food</i>

25:27.942 --> 25:31.320
<i>And I'm off, ready for my morning honey</i>

25:35.074 --> 25:36.284
Ouch.

25:36.868 --> 25:39.162
Some honey will make me feel better.

25:39.829 --> 25:41.330
Oh, bother.

25:42.415 --> 25:45.752
Somebody seems to have eaten
all the honey.

26:01.601 --> 26:03.061
Oh, my.

26:03.227 --> 26:04.771
Foggy today.

26:05.688 --> 26:08.274
If I know anything about anything...

26:08.441 --> 26:12.278
it's easy to lose your way
on a foggy day.

26:12.445 --> 26:16.866
And rather hard to find the way back.

26:18.201 --> 26:22.955
Piglet always has a little smackerel
of something hidden away.

26:24.874 --> 26:26.626
Piglet?

26:28.294 --> 26:29.629
It's Pooh.

26:29.796 --> 26:31.756
Are you home?

26:34.509 --> 26:36.552
It would appear not.

26:36.719 --> 26:38.596
Rabbit!

26:38.763 --> 26:40.890
Are you home?

26:41.057 --> 26:43.518
It's Bear speaking.

26:44.018 --> 26:45.853
Eeyore!

26:46.938 --> 26:49.232
Where is everybody?

26:50.483 --> 26:53.194
How gloomy and sad.

26:53.361 --> 26:56.322
If only Eeyore were here to enjoy it.

26:57.073 --> 26:58.449
Hello?

26:58.616 --> 27:00.368
Anybody here?

27:00.535 --> 27:03.371
Can anybody hear me?

27:03.538 --> 27:05.414
Hello?

27:08.584 --> 27:10.795
What has happened to my friends?

27:17.093 --> 27:18.302
Oh, dear.

27:18.469 --> 27:20.555
I appear to have reached the end...

27:20.721 --> 27:23.015
of my thoughts.

27:34.610 --> 27:36.612
<i>Come on, Pooh.</i>

27:40.158 --> 27:42.368
Christopher?

27:43.494 --> 27:45.121
Are you there?

27:46.122 --> 27:47.498
It's me.

27:47.665 --> 27:49.750
Winnie the Pooh.

27:49.917 --> 27:52.837
Are you finally home?

27:54.338 --> 27:56.674
Think, think, think.

27:58.259 --> 28:01.470
It would seem I must go forward...

28:01.637 --> 28:03.097
where I have never been...

28:03.264 --> 28:04.473
rather than backwards...

28:05.850 --> 28:08.144
where I have.

28:11.022 --> 28:15.484
Christopher Robin
must help me find everybody.

28:15.651 --> 28:18.154
Or help everybody find me.

28:19.071 --> 28:22.783
That will be the order
of looking for things.

28:27.997 --> 28:30.833
Christopher?
Are you here?

28:32.043 --> 28:33.294
It's Pooh.

28:40.927 --> 28:42.762
Hello.

28:43.638 --> 28:45.264
It's Pooh.

28:45.890 --> 28:47.099
Are you hiding?

28:56.901 --> 28:59.320
I'm getting very sleepy.

29:00.821 --> 29:02.949
And that looks like a bed.

29:08.788 --> 29:12.250
Where, oh, where
is Christopher Robin?

29:52.123 --> 29:55.042
What to do, what to do,
what to do?

29:55.209 --> 29:57.712
What to do, indeed.

30:01.299 --> 30:02.550
Pooh?

30:03.259 --> 30:05.720
- Christopher Robin!
- No!

30:06.137 --> 30:07.930
No,no,no,no,no!

30:08.639 --> 30:10.474
You can't be here.

30:12.351 --> 30:13.936
This can't be happening.

30:14.603 --> 30:16.605
- It's stress.
- It's not stress.

30:16.772 --> 30:17.773
My God, I'm stressed.

30:17.940 --> 30:19.859
- It's Pooh.
- I'm so exhausted.

30:20.026 --> 30:21.235
Evelyn warned me.

30:21.402 --> 30:23.154
I like to be warmed.

30:23.321 --> 30:26.532
Warmed and cozy.

30:26.699 --> 30:28.242
I've cracked.

30:31.078 --> 30:33.080
I've totally cracked.

30:33.247 --> 30:35.207
I don't see any cracks.

30:35.374 --> 30:37.460
A few wrinkles maybe.

30:38.461 --> 30:40.046
Pooh!

30:41.339 --> 30:43.090
You're here!

30:44.342 --> 30:46.093
How are you here, Pooh?

30:46.844 --> 30:51.766
I went through the door through which
Christopher Robin is known to appear.

30:51.932 --> 30:54.685
And now, I'm here!

30:55.644 --> 30:58.064
But the tree I remember was
behind the cottage in Sussex...

30:58.230 --> 30:59.357
not here in London.

30:59.523 --> 31:01.609
I suppose it's where it needs to be.

31:02.109 --> 31:04.445
There's no opening.

31:05.905 --> 31:07.656
There's no door on the other side.

31:08.824 --> 31:10.743
We must not need it anymore.

31:10.910 --> 31:12.328
That's a silly explanation.

31:12.495 --> 31:13.871
Why, thank you.

31:14.038 --> 31:16.916
Are you glad to see me,
Christopher Robin?

31:17.917 --> 31:20.252
Well, hello there!

31:20.961 --> 31:22.963
What have you got there, secret Susan?

31:24.215 --> 31:27.510
Well, it's a, it's a... a cat.

31:27.676 --> 31:28.969
Yes, definitely.

31:29.136 --> 31:30.137
Just a cat.

31:30.304 --> 31:31.847
I love cats.
May I? Can I?

31:32.014 --> 31:35.142
Not this one,
because it's a diseased cat.

31:35.309 --> 31:37.228
It's ferocious. It's a biter.

31:37.395 --> 31:39.939
I was about to take it in, give it some milk.
You know, rehabilitate it.

31:40.106 --> 31:42.149
- You're squishing me.
- What on earth?

31:42.316 --> 31:43.818
- Did you hear my voice there?
- Yeah.

31:43.984 --> 31:45.903
I do that funny voice,
"You're squashing me...

31:46.404 --> 31:49.698
"with your demands to play gin rummy."

31:50.491 --> 31:52.451
I was like a ventriloquist
when I was younger.

31:52.618 --> 31:54.995
Very good.
Very good.

31:55.788 --> 31:57.623
We've got all weekend.

31:57.790 --> 31:58.666
For?

31:58.833 --> 32:00.334
Gin rummy.

32:00.501 --> 32:02.211
We should probably
try and play cards tomorrow then.

32:02.378 --> 32:03.421
I'd love that.

32:03.587 --> 32:04.672
- Yes!
- Tomorrow?

32:04.839 --> 32:06.173
Yes, good evening!

32:06.340 --> 32:08.509
- Good night!
- Have a nice...

32:08.676 --> 32:11.470
- See you tomorrow.
- Stop wriggling, he's gonna see you moving.

32:11.637 --> 32:12.930
Good evening.

32:13.097 --> 32:14.223
Stop it.

32:14.390 --> 32:16.100
Meow!
You see?

32:16.725 --> 32:17.977
Yeah.

32:28.446 --> 32:30.448
It really is very good.

32:31.740 --> 32:33.784
Are you sure you wouldn't like some,
Christopher Robin?

32:34.577 --> 32:37.037
Yes, yes, I'm sure.

32:37.204 --> 32:40.166
Pooh, how ever did you recognize me?

32:40.332 --> 32:42.084
After all these years.

32:42.251 --> 32:43.252
Well...

32:44.879 --> 32:46.797
You haven't changed a bit.

32:46.964 --> 32:48.424
But I've changed tremendously.

32:49.258 --> 32:50.885
Not right here.

32:53.596 --> 32:56.640
It's still you looking out.

32:56.807 --> 32:58.267
I'm covered in honey now.

32:59.226 --> 33:00.394
Yes, I see.

33:06.984 --> 33:08.903
Sticky mess.

33:11.197 --> 33:14.325
Your floor is very sticky.

33:14.825 --> 33:16.243
Pooh.

33:17.912 --> 33:20.039
This place is very big.

33:20.206 --> 33:21.665
Do you live here all alone?

33:22.917 --> 33:25.461
Just now, yes.
But usually, no.

33:25.628 --> 33:28.339
My wife and daughter
are in the countryside for the weekend.

33:29.548 --> 33:31.842
Well, why aren't you with them?

33:34.803 --> 33:36.305
Sticky business.

33:36.472 --> 33:38.015
I had to stay for work.

33:38.182 --> 33:40.726
Why are you here
and not in the forest with your friends?

33:40.893 --> 33:42.061
That's the question, Pooh.

33:42.228 --> 33:44.480
I couldn't find anybody.

33:44.647 --> 33:47.525
And, I couldn't find anyone either.

33:47.691 --> 33:48.943
And I looked for them both.

33:50.736 --> 33:52.321
Hello?

33:53.364 --> 33:56.200
Piglet? Eeyore? Tigger?

33:56.534 --> 33:58.035
Where is everybody?

33:58.202 --> 34:00.996
Exactly!
Where is Tigger, or Kanga, or Roo?

34:01.163 --> 34:02.414
That's why I'm here.

34:02.581 --> 34:03.999
I'm sure I don't know where they are.

34:04.166 --> 34:05.668
I've scarcely thought about them in 30 years.

34:07.670 --> 34:09.797
Well, we think about you every day.

34:10.339 --> 34:13.425
Well, that's very kind.
And I'm sorry, Pooh.

34:13.592 --> 34:16.011
But it's getting late,
and I'm very busy.

34:16.178 --> 34:18.681
I haven't got time to help you look.
I'm on a deadline.

34:19.348 --> 34:21.183
So, do you think you might just...

34:23.561 --> 34:25.813
You silly old bear.

35:09.273 --> 35:11.483
Good night, Winnie the Pooh.

35:21.869 --> 35:23.037
What on earth!

35:23.203 --> 35:24.872
- Pooh!
- Oh, dear.

35:26.582 --> 35:27.708
What luck.

35:27.875 --> 35:28.876
Pooh!

35:29.043 --> 35:30.419
Your ladder is broken.

35:30.586 --> 35:32.504
That's not a ladder.
That was a shelf.

35:32.671 --> 35:35.758
That explains why it's no good
for climbing.

35:37.301 --> 35:39.345
I haven't got time to muck about.

35:39.511 --> 35:42.222
I should be working.
Trying to find a solution.

35:42.389 --> 35:44.683
Even though I think it may be impossible.

35:44.850 --> 35:47.311
People say nothing is impossible.

35:47.478 --> 35:49.313
But I do nothing every day.

35:49.730 --> 35:52.316
No, Pooh, that's not the...
Never mind.

35:52.483 --> 35:54.485
Look, I can't be distracted.

35:54.652 --> 35:56.487
Which is why you need to go home.

35:56.654 --> 35:58.405
But how?

36:07.706 --> 36:09.208
Sussex.

36:09.375 --> 36:11.293
We go to Sussex.

36:11.460 --> 36:14.588
And we get you back
in your own home. Now!

36:21.387 --> 36:24.556
It's very loud
and not in a hummy sort of way.

36:24.723 --> 36:26.308
Well, welcome to London.

36:29.770 --> 36:32.231
Well, hello there.
Are you on an expotition, too?

36:33.148 --> 36:34.566
- Oh, bother!
- Pooh!

36:36.402 --> 36:37.653
What did you do?

36:37.820 --> 36:39.321
Do you think he's all right?

36:39.488 --> 36:40.781
Come here.
Come in here.

36:41.323 --> 36:42.533
Look.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.785
You can't just keep saying hello
to people.

36:45.119 --> 36:47.037
People can't see you moving
and talking.

36:47.204 --> 36:48.205
But why?

36:48.372 --> 36:50.874
<i>Because, because...</i>

36:51.041 --> 36:52.292
You're different.

36:52.459 --> 36:54.878
And people don't like things
that are different.

36:55.379 --> 36:57.756
So I shouldn't be me.

36:58.173 --> 37:00.509
No! No, you should always be yourself.

37:01.677 --> 37:03.429
This is very confusing.

37:03.595 --> 37:04.972
It may be the hunger.

37:05.139 --> 37:07.224
- You've just eaten!
- Oh, that's right.

37:07.391 --> 37:09.184
Maybe I didn't eat enough.

37:09.351 --> 37:11.687
Look, never mind about that.

37:11.854 --> 37:14.857
For now,
just try and be a less exuberant you.

37:15.023 --> 37:17.025
- Ex-Pooh-berant.
- Flop.

37:17.192 --> 37:18.235
Sag.

37:18.402 --> 37:19.403
Go limp.

37:19.570 --> 37:21.363
- Flop. Sag.
- Yes!

37:21.530 --> 37:22.948
Go limp.

37:23.115 --> 37:24.700
I know, I've got it!

37:24.867 --> 37:26.326
<i>How about, may “Nap“me“</i>

37:26.493 --> 37:27.911
- I love play!
- Let's see it.

37:28.078 --> 37:28.954
Like this?

37:30.581 --> 37:33.250
Well done!
Now, just keep absolutely still.

37:33.459 --> 37:35.627
That's it.
Come on.

37:35.794 --> 37:38.922
Christopher!
There's a rumbly in my tumbly.

37:39.089 --> 37:40.758
Let's stop for a snack.

37:40.924 --> 37:42.259
There's no time for snacks.

37:42.426 --> 37:45.429
- What about a smackerel?
- Play "Naptime!"

37:45.596 --> 37:46.805
Balloons!
Come and get them.

37:47.181 --> 37:49.433
- May I have a travel balloon?
- You don't need a balloon.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.018
Well, I know I don't need one...

37:51.185 --> 37:53.103
but I would like one
very, very much, please.

37:53.270 --> 37:54.605
Please. Please!

37:54.772 --> 37:55.814
We've got all your favorite colors!

37:55.981 --> 37:57.858
I'd like a balloon, please.

37:58.025 --> 37:58.984
What color?

37:59.151 --> 38:00.027
Red.

38:00.861 --> 38:02.070
Red will be fine, yes.

38:02.905 --> 38:03.947
Thank you very much.

38:04.323 --> 38:05.824
Thank you ever so much.

38:05.991 --> 38:06.742
Balloons!

38:24.718 --> 38:27.262
- Here is your ticket.
- Thank you very much.

38:27.429 --> 38:28.430
Good morning, sir.

38:28.597 --> 38:30.474
- Good morning.
- Why is he in a cage?

38:32.059 --> 38:33.644
I'd like a return ticket, please?

38:33.811 --> 38:35.312
To Hartfield in Sussex.
Thank you.

38:35.479 --> 38:36.480
Certainly, sir.

38:36.647 --> 38:38.398
Could you give me some space, please?

38:39.858 --> 38:41.109
Your ticket.

38:43.946 --> 38:45.280
Here we are.

38:45.447 --> 38:47.616
And still two minutes to spare.
So, good, yes?

38:47.783 --> 38:49.576
- On the dot, sir.
- Good, thank you.

38:52.579 --> 38:54.540
The balloon went that way, sir.

38:54.706 --> 38:56.208
Thank you.

39:02.256 --> 39:03.799
Excuse me.

39:04.508 --> 39:05.634
I'm terribly sorry.

39:05.884 --> 39:07.052
I'm terribly sorry.

39:07.219 --> 39:08.512
Sorry, sorry.

39:15.769 --> 39:17.104
There he is!

39:17.271 --> 39:18.480
Right.

39:21.108 --> 39:22.109
Excuse me.

39:23.068 --> 39:25.654
You're not a Woozle, are you?

39:28.615 --> 39:30.951
Christopher Robin!
Thank goodness.

39:31.118 --> 39:33.453
- Give me that!
- That's mine. Give it back.

39:33.620 --> 39:34.830
Well, he was mine first, you know?

39:34.997 --> 39:35.998
That is true.

39:36.164 --> 39:37.332
Oh, for heaven's sake!

39:37.499 --> 39:39.751
You can't just take a teddy bear
from a grown man.

39:42.462 --> 39:46.341
Christopher, could you turn the world
right side up again, please?

39:46.925 --> 39:49.636
Did that say honey?
Can we go back?

39:51.763 --> 39:52.890
- Excuse me.
- Much better.

39:53.056 --> 39:54.141
I thought you were playing "Naptime."

39:54.308 --> 39:55.517
It was one of my briefer naps.

39:58.312 --> 40:00.981
But, Christopher, my balloon.

40:01.148 --> 40:04.234
Well, it's gone now.
You don't need it anymore anyway.

40:04.401 --> 40:06.320
But it did make me very happy.

40:06.486 --> 40:07.905
Did it not make you happy?

40:08.071 --> 40:09.406
Not really.

40:24.421 --> 40:26.590
Do you always have that case with you?

40:26.757 --> 40:29.343
What? A case?

40:29.509 --> 40:32.095
My briefcase?
Yes, usually. Why?

40:32.596 --> 40:35.140
Is it more important than...

40:35.307 --> 40:36.433
a balloon?

40:39.603 --> 40:42.439
Yes, it's more important than a balloon.

40:42.606 --> 40:44.232
I see.

40:44.733 --> 40:47.653
More like... a blanket.

40:47.819 --> 40:48.946
Yes.

40:49.112 --> 40:52.699
More like a blanket.

40:53.784 --> 40:55.577
What does it do?

40:55.744 --> 40:57.204
What?

40:57.371 --> 40:59.539
It's for keeping very important things in.

40:59.706 --> 41:02.501
Pooh, do you think you might be able to
amuse yourself for a while?

41:02.668 --> 41:04.795
I have got some rather pressing work to do.

41:07.839 --> 41:09.132
House.

41:09.299 --> 41:10.550
Clouds.

41:10.717 --> 41:12.094
House.

41:12.260 --> 41:13.929
Tree.

41:14.096 --> 41:16.556
Bush. A man.

41:16.723 --> 41:18.350
- Dog.
- Pooh.

41:19.017 --> 41:20.978
- What're you doing?
- I'm playing a game.

41:21.144 --> 41:23.855
It's called "Say What You See."

41:24.022 --> 41:27.275
Could you "Say What You See"
a little more quietly?

41:32.155 --> 41:33.281
House.

41:33.448 --> 41:34.574
Grass.

41:34.741 --> 41:35.742
Trees.

41:36.243 --> 41:37.869
Pond.

41:38.245 --> 41:40.122
I don't know what that is.

41:40.288 --> 41:41.540
- Pooh.
- Well, that's a man.

41:42.582 --> 41:44.001
Pooh.

41:44.459 --> 41:47.129
Little bit more quietly. Please?

41:48.505 --> 41:52.676
I'm sorry,
this compartment is rather full.

41:54.136 --> 41:56.513
It's his naptime.

42:11.028 --> 42:13.989
<i>We'll save at least 322 pounds a month.</i>

42:15.574 --> 42:17.701
<i>Well, that's not nothing.</i>

42:18.326 --> 42:21.163
Which brings us to 14%.

42:21.329 --> 42:22.706
<i>Still not enough.</i>

42:26.043 --> 42:27.127
<i>Someone's gonna have to walk the plank.</i>

42:27.836 --> 42:29.713
<i>They'll never forgive me for this.</i>

42:29.880 --> 42:31.214
<i>Sorry, Gary.</i>

42:31.381 --> 42:34.134
Now arriving at Hartfield Station.

42:41.767 --> 42:44.352
Hartfield! Hartfield Station!

42:48.231 --> 42:49.733
Look. My balloon!

42:52.194 --> 42:54.571
Now come on, Pooh.
We've got to hurry.

42:54.738 --> 42:56.698
Yes.
We need to find our friends.

42:56.865 --> 42:59.576
No, Pooh.
I meant, I have to get back for work.

43:15.675 --> 43:17.469
- Are we going in?
- No, no, Pooh.

43:17.636 --> 43:18.804
We must keep very quiet.

43:18.970 --> 43:21.139
Not let them see us.
Come on.

43:21.306 --> 43:22.390
Stay low.

43:22.557 --> 43:23.725
Oh.

43:24.768 --> 43:26.353
- Who is that?
- Pooh!

43:26.520 --> 43:29.272
She can't be Pooh. I'm Pooh.

43:29.439 --> 43:32.150
No, that's Evelyn.
My wife.

43:33.568 --> 43:35.904
She looks very kind.

43:36.822 --> 43:38.657
She is very kind.

43:44.830 --> 43:46.915
And who is that?

43:47.666 --> 43:48.959
That's Madeline.

43:49.668 --> 43:51.545
My daughter.

43:51.711 --> 43:54.131
- Can she come and play with us?
- No, she can't come.

43:55.423 --> 43:56.591
Does she not like to play?

43:56.758 --> 43:59.469
No, no, it's just...
Well, look, she's working.

44:00.887 --> 44:02.097
I see.

44:03.431 --> 44:05.517
Does she have a briefcase like you?

44:07.185 --> 44:08.395
No.

44:09.271 --> 44:12.065
- Come on, Pooh.
- Do you think she'd like my red balloon?

44:12.232 --> 44:13.567
It might make her happy.

44:13.733 --> 44:15.485
What is it with you and the balloon?

44:15.652 --> 44:18.155
There's more to happiness
than just balloons, Pooh.

44:18.321 --> 44:21.867
Look, Madeline is happy
and I'm happy that she's happy.

44:22.033 --> 44:23.660
Let's go.

44:42.554 --> 44:43.555
There, Pooh.

44:44.139 --> 44:46.224
I got you home.

44:49.769 --> 44:51.146
Aren't you coming with me?

44:51.313 --> 44:53.023
I can't.
I've gotta go back to London.

44:53.190 --> 44:54.691
But I need your help.

44:54.858 --> 44:56.776
I've lost all of my friends.

44:56.943 --> 44:58.195
Perhaps they're back now...

44:58.361 --> 45:00.447
and you can tell them
all about your adventures.

45:02.157 --> 45:04.159
I would like to do that.

45:04.618 --> 45:06.286
Off you go then.

45:10.498 --> 45:13.251
Goodbye, Christopher.

45:13.418 --> 45:15.337
Goodbye, Pooh.

45:33.521 --> 45:35.148
What're you doing, Pooh?

45:35.857 --> 45:40.028
Sometimes when I'm going somewhere
and I wait...

45:40.195 --> 45:42.155
a somewhere comes to me.

45:42.322 --> 45:43.281
Right.

45:44.741 --> 45:46.034
Good luck with everything.

45:46.201 --> 45:48.119
I should need good luck.

45:48.286 --> 45:52.540
For I am a bear of very little brain.

45:52.958 --> 45:56.002
Right. Well, goodbye.

45:56.169 --> 45:58.004
Good bye.

46:09.057 --> 46:11.559
Look out, Pooh.
Here I come.

46:16.564 --> 46:18.024
Pooh?

46:20.694 --> 46:21.945
Pooh!

46:23.238 --> 46:24.406
Pooh!

46:36.293 --> 46:37.961
So this is what this feels like.

46:38.128 --> 46:39.587
Are you stuck?

46:39.754 --> 46:41.881
Yes, it would appear that I am stuck.

46:42.048 --> 46:45.802
Happens to me all the time.
Have you just eaten honey?

46:45.969 --> 46:50.473
No, Pooh, I have not just eaten honey.

46:56.646 --> 46:58.023
Oh, it's still here.

46:59.399 --> 47:01.735
Hundred Acre Wood.

47:02.110 --> 47:04.070
Well, I didn't expect to be here
this morning.

47:07.782 --> 47:09.784
Was it always this gloomy?

47:09.951 --> 47:12.370
I don't believe so.

47:12.537 --> 47:14.080
I wonder where they all could be.

47:14.706 --> 47:15.999
I was hoping you would know.

47:16.166 --> 47:18.293
Pooh, I haven't been here for years.
How would I know?

47:18.460 --> 47:20.003
But you're Christopher Robin.

47:21.004 --> 47:22.714
Right. Yes.

47:22.881 --> 47:25.216
Well, the thing is
to do this systematically.

47:26.051 --> 47:28.303
Follow the simple honey bee.

47:28.470 --> 47:29.637
No, Pooh.

47:29.804 --> 47:32.515
The key is to head in just one direction
to avoid getting lost.

47:32.682 --> 47:34.059
Especially in all this fog.

47:34.225 --> 47:36.269
I always get to where I'm going...

47:36.436 --> 47:39.064
by walking away from where I have been.

47:39.230 --> 47:40.482
Do you?

47:40.774 --> 47:42.817
That's the way I do it.

47:44.027 --> 47:45.070
I'm hungry.

47:45.236 --> 47:46.446
Come on, Pooh.

47:46.613 --> 47:49.240
We'll never get anywhere at this rate.

47:55.497 --> 47:57.374
Is anything familiar?

47:57.540 --> 47:59.542
- The fog.
- Besides the fog.

48:01.378 --> 48:03.254
Oh, bother.

48:03.421 --> 48:05.131
What's the matter?

48:05.298 --> 48:06.424
Oh, Pooh.

48:07.175 --> 48:10.220
You can't be serious. There's no such thing
as Heffalumps and Woozles.

48:10.387 --> 48:11.971
Of course there are.

48:12.138 --> 48:14.516
Didn't you see the sign?

48:16.935 --> 48:19.521
Pooh, terrifying elephant
and weasel-like beasts...

48:19.687 --> 48:22.690
who wander the world
preying on happiness aren't real.

48:23.566 --> 48:25.110
Now, come on.

48:27.904 --> 48:29.072
Christopher?

48:29.656 --> 48:31.408
What do you do?

48:31.574 --> 48:34.202
I'm the Efficiency Manager
at a luggage company.

48:34.619 --> 48:36.371
You must have many friends there.

48:36.788 --> 48:38.581
There's lots of people who rely on me.

48:38.748 --> 48:39.916
So, yes.

48:40.083 --> 48:42.043
No, I don't think of them as friends.

48:42.210 --> 48:44.462
That makes it harder
if I have to let them go.

48:45.255 --> 48:46.714
Where will they go?

48:46.881 --> 48:49.092
I don't know, Pooh.
I don't know.

48:51.928 --> 48:53.721
Did you let me go?

48:58.601 --> 49:00.478
I suppose I did.

49:03.565 --> 49:04.774
Come on, Pooh.

49:14.993 --> 49:16.286
What is that?

49:16.453 --> 49:18.371
It's a compass, from the war.

49:18.538 --> 49:19.873
I still keep it with me.

49:22.333 --> 49:23.918
May I see the compass?

49:24.794 --> 49:26.754
Yes, I suppose so.

49:31.593 --> 49:34.095
Shall we follow this very handy arrow?

49:34.262 --> 49:35.930
Well, that's a very good idea.

49:36.097 --> 49:37.098
No, wait, Pooh.

49:37.265 --> 49:38.600
Keep us headed north.

49:38.766 --> 49:39.893
North.

49:40.768 --> 49:42.103
Oh, north.

49:42.645 --> 49:45.106
Yes, there's an "N" in front of it,
for "north."

49:45.273 --> 49:48.318
That's what that means.

49:52.989 --> 49:55.200
Isn't this the same sign?

49:55.658 --> 49:57.952
Pooh, are you sure
we're still heading north?

49:58.119 --> 49:59.913
Let me look.

50:00.079 --> 50:01.164
You haven't been looking?

50:01.331 --> 50:03.875
Not since I started following
these footsteps.

50:05.043 --> 50:07.170
Pooh, they're our footsteps!

50:07.337 --> 50:10.173
We've just been going around
in a great, big circle.

50:10.340 --> 50:13.259
What's the matter with you?
All you had to do was follow the compass!

50:13.426 --> 50:16.095
But it led us to the Heffalumps
and the Woozles.

50:16.262 --> 50:18.890
There are no Heffalumps and Woozles,
do you hear?

50:20.183 --> 50:21.851
I should never have trusted you with it!

50:23.019 --> 50:24.812
I'm sorry.

50:25.355 --> 50:30.109
I'll put it back in the holder
of important things.

50:31.444 --> 50:34.197
My papers! They're irreplaceable!

50:34.364 --> 50:35.990
I shall never remember all this!

50:36.157 --> 50:37.617
Pooh, you're right.

50:37.784 --> 50:39.661
You are a bear of very little brain.

50:39.827 --> 50:43.164
Do you know what'll happen
if I lose one single sheet of this?

50:43.331 --> 50:45.291
Winslow will eat me for breakfast.

50:45.458 --> 50:47.126
A Woozle will eat you for breakfast?

50:47.293 --> 50:49.796
Yes, a great big Woozle
will gobble me up.

50:49.963 --> 50:51.214
That doesn't sound like fun.

50:51.381 --> 50:53.424
That's the real world for you.

50:53.591 --> 50:58.096
Pooh, there's more to life
than just balloons and honey.

50:58.263 --> 50:59.347
Are you sure?

50:59.514 --> 51:00.932
Silly bear.

51:01.099 --> 51:03.059
I don't know why you came back.

51:03.226 --> 51:05.186
I'm not a child anymore.

51:05.353 --> 51:08.940
I'm an adult,
with adult responsibilities.

51:09.440 --> 51:12.402
But you're Christopher Robin.

51:14.612 --> 51:15.780
No.

51:15.947 --> 51:18.616
I'm not how you remember me.

51:19.409 --> 51:21.202
I'm sorry.

51:21.369 --> 51:22.537
You're right.

51:23.162 --> 51:25.623
You should let me go...

51:25.790 --> 51:27.792
for a fish in the sea.

51:29.043 --> 51:31.129
"A fish in the sea?"

51:31.296 --> 51:33.548
No, "efficiency!"

51:35.925 --> 51:37.176
Pooh?

51:37.802 --> 51:39.554
Pooh?

51:41.681 --> 51:43.182
Winnie the Pooh?

51:48.855 --> 51:50.815
I haven't got time for this.

51:50.982 --> 51:51.983
Pooh!

51:52.150 --> 51:53.776
Pooh, where are you?

51:53.943 --> 51:56.362
Where have you gone, you silly bear?

51:56.529 --> 51:58.281
I didn't mean to frighten you. Pooh!

51:58.448 --> 52:01.618
Tigger, Eeyore, anyone?

52:03.411 --> 52:05.622
There's no such things as
Heffalumps and Woozles.

52:05.788 --> 52:07.540
Not real, not real, not real.

52:11.252 --> 52:12.462
Not real.

52:12.629 --> 52:14.505
Not real, not real, not real.

52:24.098 --> 52:27.393
Oh, no! No, I'm not a Heffalump!

52:27.560 --> 52:29.270
They're up there!

52:29.437 --> 52:31.648
And I'm down here.

52:32.357 --> 52:33.983
Pooh!

52:34.150 --> 52:35.985
Somebody help!

52:37.320 --> 52:38.404
Perfect!

52:46.162 --> 52:49.040
<i>You're the man of the house now.</i>

52:49.207 --> 52:51.125
<i>I haven't seen you laugh in years.</i>

52:51.292 --> 52:53.044
<i>Dreams don't come for free.</i>

52:53.211 --> 52:54.212
<i>One day you're going to crack.</i>

52:54.379 --> 52:55.713
<i>Nothing comes from nothing.</i>

52:55.880 --> 53:00.968
<i>You need to ask yourself the question,
"Am I a swimmer, or am I a sinker?"</i>

53:05.139 --> 53:10.103
Sometimes the thing to do is nothing.

53:19.987 --> 53:21.489
Oh, no!

53:21.656 --> 53:22.573
Christopher.

53:25.076 --> 53:25.952
No!

53:26.119 --> 53:28.621
Come back to us!

53:32.625 --> 53:35.545
Just do nothing! Just do nothing!

53:54.147 --> 53:55.523
Pooh!

53:56.482 --> 53:57.817
Anyone?

54:51.329 --> 54:53.623
Just my luck.

54:53.790 --> 54:55.124
A Heffalump.

54:55.291 --> 54:57.376
Leering at his lunch.

54:58.169 --> 54:59.587
Eeyore, I'm not a Heffalump!

54:59.754 --> 55:03.382
Doesn't matter anyway.
Headed for the waterfall.

55:03.549 --> 55:05.134
I'll be gone soon.

55:05.301 --> 55:08.179
Oh, no, not the waterfall.

55:08.679 --> 55:09.680
Swim!

55:09.847 --> 55:11.974
Not that anyone will notice.

55:12.141 --> 55:13.392
Swim, swim, swim!

55:13.559 --> 55:16.813
Just have to go with the flow.

55:16.979 --> 55:19.357
- Don't worry.
- I'm not.

55:19.524 --> 55:21.818
Can't change the inevitable.

55:21.984 --> 55:24.862
You mustn't give up, Eeyore!
I'll save you.

55:25.029 --> 55:26.197
We'll see.

55:30.493 --> 55:32.453
Yes, of course.
I've grown up, haven't I?

55:34.121 --> 55:35.164
Eeyore!

55:35.331 --> 55:38.042
Laughing at my misfortune.

55:38.209 --> 55:40.419
Just like a Heffalump.

55:43.214 --> 55:44.215
Hello, Eeyore.

55:44.382 --> 55:45.967
Hello, Heffalump.

55:46.133 --> 55:49.262
I'm not a Heffalump.
I'm Christopher Robin.

55:49.804 --> 55:52.098
Do you remember,
I used to try and cheer you up?

55:52.265 --> 55:54.183
I don't remember being cheery.

55:54.350 --> 55:56.310
What were you doing in the water?

55:56.477 --> 56:00.231
Just an average Windsday morning for me.

56:00.398 --> 56:02.441
Woke up. Windy.

56:02.608 --> 56:04.861
Wind blew me
into the river.

56:05.027 --> 56:07.113
It must know I can't swim.

56:07.822 --> 56:10.032
There's that sound again.

56:10.575 --> 56:14.537
It's your fellow Heffalumps,
calling you home.

56:15.955 --> 56:18.624
Come on, Eeyore.
Let's get to the bottom of this.

56:18.791 --> 56:21.294
I'm already at the bottom.

56:22.670 --> 56:25.089
It's kind of you to kidnap me.

56:26.841 --> 56:27.967
Now we're getting somewhere.

56:28.134 --> 56:30.469
Not exactly what I had in mind.

56:30.636 --> 56:33.097
Oh, look, Owl's house has fallen
out of the tree again.

56:33.556 --> 56:35.099
And there's that terrible noise.

56:35.266 --> 56:38.185
I think it's behind the house.

56:38.352 --> 56:40.146
Well, I think we should investigate.

56:40.730 --> 56:43.691
I wouldn't go in there if I was us.

56:44.817 --> 56:47.028
There's no such things as Heffalumps.

56:48.070 --> 56:49.697
There's no such things as Heffalumps.

56:52.325 --> 56:53.534
There's no such...

56:55.286 --> 56:55.953
Look.

56:57.079 --> 56:58.539
It's just the old weather vane.

56:58.706 --> 57:01.417
Great. Now it has a weapon.

57:01.584 --> 57:03.920
No sign of Owl though, either.

57:04.795 --> 57:06.631
Wonder what happened.

57:06.797 --> 57:09.050
If only Christopher Robin were here.

57:09.216 --> 57:11.177
I am Christopher Robin.

57:11.761 --> 57:14.889
You should be able to tell us then.

57:18.476 --> 57:20.186
Let's see.

57:21.145 --> 57:23.064
Looks like they were all here.

57:23.230 --> 57:24.857
Rabbit...

57:25.191 --> 57:27.068
Oh, someone was bouncing.

57:27.985 --> 57:29.946
- Tigger.
- Looks like a disaster.

57:30.488 --> 57:32.198
Why wasn't I invited?

57:32.365 --> 57:33.616
So I think what happened is...

57:33.783 --> 57:36.953
the weather vane broke off
when the house fell out of the tree...

57:37.119 --> 57:38.621
and started making that noise...

57:38.788 --> 57:40.581
and they all thought
it was a Heffalump and panicked.

57:41.374 --> 57:42.625
And then they all...

57:42.792 --> 57:44.543
flew out of the door.

57:46.671 --> 57:48.547
Look, haycorn shells.
A whole trail of them.

57:48.714 --> 57:50.841
Follow them and we'll find Piglet.

57:51.008 --> 57:52.134
Now that is...

57:55.346 --> 57:56.514
I'm sorry, old bean.

57:57.139 --> 57:59.725
- Come on.
- I was just getting comfortable.

58:00.142 --> 58:02.144
Let's go and see if we can't find Piglet.

58:02.311 --> 58:03.980
Goodbye, Bucket.

58:04.146 --> 58:05.439
There's one.

58:07.566 --> 58:08.567
And here.

58:10.111 --> 58:11.028
Another one.

58:11.195 --> 58:13.739
You don't have to tell me
every time you pick one up.

58:13.906 --> 58:15.116
And another...

58:21.539 --> 58:23.249
Who is it? Who's there?

58:23.416 --> 58:25.501
It's nobody.

58:25.668 --> 58:27.837
Oh, Eeyore. Thank goodness it's you.

58:29.005 --> 58:30.548
And a Heffalump.

58:34.093 --> 58:36.303
Piglet, it's just me. Christopher Robin.

58:36.470 --> 58:40.224
Don't move. Don't move, Eeyore.
Maybe it won't eat us.

58:40.391 --> 58:41.851
Oh, Piglet.

58:42.018 --> 58:43.769
Would a Heffalump offer you a haycorn?

58:43.936 --> 58:46.355
It would if it was trying to trick me!

58:51.986 --> 58:53.571
- His legs are so long!
- Piglet!

58:53.738 --> 58:54.947
I didn't mean to frighten you. Come on.

58:55.239 --> 58:56.991
I'm not frightened. I'm not frightened.

58:57.533 --> 58:58.534
I'm terrified.

59:00.036 --> 59:01.871
Got to go quicker.
Got to go quicker.

59:02.038 --> 59:04.540
These haycorns are weighing me down,
but I can't let go.

59:05.249 --> 59:06.792
He's coming! It's coming!

59:06.959 --> 59:08.711
Piglet, you have a head full of fluff.

59:08.878 --> 59:11.380
You've led it right to us!
Now we're stuffed!

59:11.547 --> 59:13.591
What's the point of hiding
if you're going to bring him to us?

59:14.008 --> 59:15.926
- Hello, everyone.
- Nobody move.

59:16.385 --> 59:19.055
Heffalumps can't see you
if you don't move.

59:19.221 --> 59:21.140
- I can clearly see you.
- Well, you didn't see this.

59:21.307 --> 59:24.518
I'll pounce ya. I'll pound ya.

59:24.685 --> 59:27.104
Tigger! It's Christopher Robin.

59:27.688 --> 59:30.024
Tigger, just look.
Look closely.

59:30.691 --> 59:34.236
He's giant. Huge!
He's a massive beast.

59:34.403 --> 59:35.529
And he smells a little funny.

59:35.696 --> 59:37.323
Don't look him in the eye.

59:37.490 --> 59:39.742
He has hair everywhere!

59:39.909 --> 59:41.577
Even in his ears.

59:41.744 --> 59:42.828
Such troubled eyes.

59:42.995 --> 59:45.206
- His nose is huge!
- He's hideous.

59:45.372 --> 59:46.499
Well, that's a bit harsh.

59:46.957 --> 59:48.250
- He's clearly a Heffalump.
- Don't stare.

59:48.417 --> 59:51.128
No, the Heffalump was just
your old weather vane, Owl.

59:51.629 --> 59:53.380
Have you eaten Winnie the Pooh?

59:54.340 --> 59:55.424
Did they take him?

59:55.591 --> 59:56.926
Do the monsters have Pooh?

59:57.760 --> 59:59.804
Look, there's no such thing as monsters.

01:00:00.262 --> 01:00:01.806
- He's tricking us.
- Of course there are!

01:00:01.972 --> 01:00:03.099
He lies!

01:00:03.265 --> 01:00:06.102
How dare you pretend to be Christopher Robin.
He'd never say such a thing.

01:00:06.268 --> 01:00:07.311
I am Christopher Robin.

01:00:07.478 --> 01:00:08.479
Help me.

01:00:08.646 --> 01:00:09.939
Then prove it.

01:00:10.106 --> 01:00:12.900
Christopher Robin would know
how to stop the Heffalumps.

01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:17.196
You're right, Roo.

01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:19.532
And I'm not gonna let you down.

01:00:19.698 --> 01:00:21.784
We have got a scary Heffalump here...

01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:24.870
and it's about time I,
Christopher Robin, defeated it.

01:00:25.871 --> 01:00:28.249
There! There it is!

01:00:28.499 --> 01:00:30.126
Stop, Heffalump!

01:00:30.459 --> 01:00:32.169
Come on, Eeyore. You'll be my witness.

01:00:32.336 --> 01:00:35.047
Sure. Sacrifice the donkey.

01:00:35.965 --> 01:00:37.508
- Let me stand on your back.
- No!

01:00:37.675 --> 01:00:39.051
- Your foot is on my shoulder!
- Push me up.

01:00:39.218 --> 01:00:40.845
Up, up, I'm up now.

01:00:41.011 --> 01:00:42.179
I can hear him.

01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:44.098
He's headed to a clearing.

01:00:44.515 --> 01:00:48.394
Sure, I'll just sit here while we wait
for them to show up.

01:00:49.562 --> 01:00:50.729
He's drawn his sword.

01:00:50.896 --> 01:00:52.523
- What's happening?
- He's just drawn his sword.

01:00:52.690 --> 01:00:54.150
You there!

01:00:54.316 --> 01:00:55.276
Heffalump!

01:00:55.442 --> 01:00:58.237
- He's seen it!
- It sounds agitated! Don't agitate it!

01:00:58.404 --> 01:01:01.157
I'll teach you to scare my friends!

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:05.411
But there's nothing there.

01:01:05.578 --> 01:01:07.037
Something is clearly there.
Do you hear that?

01:01:07.204 --> 01:01:08.622
- Where's he gone?
- He's gone behind the tree!

01:01:11.125 --> 01:01:12.376
Take that, Heffalump!

01:01:12.543 --> 01:01:13.752
He's got me!

01:01:13.919 --> 01:01:15.671
I think the Heffalump's got him
by the foot.

01:01:15.838 --> 01:01:17.006
It's the Heffalump that's screaming!

01:01:17.173 --> 01:01:19.425
Oh, no!
He's attacking me!

01:01:21.051 --> 01:01:21.886
Oh, no!

01:01:23.512 --> 01:01:24.763
Goodness gripes!

01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:29.894
- Christopher Robin.
- They're attacking me!

01:01:30.186 --> 01:01:31.020
It's you.

01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:32.438
Take that, you Heffalump!

01:01:32.605 --> 01:01:34.398
Playing again.

01:01:34.565 --> 01:01:36.066
Do you see it, Eeyore?

01:01:36.817 --> 01:01:38.444
I think it's a whole herd.

01:01:38.611 --> 01:01:40.571
They've got us surrounded.

01:01:40.738 --> 01:01:42.323
What do they sound like, Eeyore?

01:01:42.948 --> 01:01:44.158
Like this.

01:01:46.410 --> 01:01:47.494
That sound is terrifying!

01:01:47.661 --> 01:01:48.996
Louder, Eeyore, louder!

01:01:49.788 --> 01:01:51.415
It chills my heart.

01:01:51.582 --> 01:01:54.043
That Heffalump's lucky I'm needed here.
I'd be bouncing all over it!

01:01:56.212 --> 01:01:57.379
Attack!

01:01:58.797 --> 01:02:00.925
Well done, Eeyore.
Keep up the good work.

01:02:01.091 --> 01:02:02.509
Finally good at something.

01:02:03.719 --> 01:02:05.304
And there goes the tail.

01:02:05.471 --> 01:02:06.430
He's winning, Mum.

01:02:06.597 --> 01:02:07.723
I think you're right, Roo.

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:09.516
Then it must be Christopher Robin!

01:02:09.683 --> 01:02:12.394
I can't see what the Heffalump's doing,
but it sounds very nasty.

01:02:12.561 --> 01:02:14.605
It all sounds very, very nasty!

01:02:14.855 --> 01:02:16.523
I'm not afraid of you!

01:02:16.690 --> 01:02:18.776
You rotten, stinking Heffalump.

01:02:18.943 --> 01:02:21.153
- Go on, Christopher!
- I think he's gonna do it!

01:02:24.365 --> 01:02:25.908
There is silence.

01:02:26.075 --> 01:02:27.910
I do not know which one is standing.

01:02:28.077 --> 01:02:30.079
It's not entirely clear.

01:02:31.413 --> 01:02:32.831
Something is moving towards us.

01:02:32.998 --> 01:02:35.668
Please, please make it,
Christopher Robin.

01:02:35.834 --> 01:02:38.212
Did he win?
Mummy, tell me what's going on.

01:02:38.379 --> 01:02:39.421
Something's coming.

01:02:39.588 --> 01:02:41.173
- Can you see him?
- Yes, I can see him.

01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:44.009
- How does he look?
- Smaller, getting larger.

01:02:44.218 --> 01:02:45.219
Christopher Robin!

01:02:45.386 --> 01:02:46.845
- It's Christopher Robin! He's won!
- He did it!

01:02:47.012 --> 01:02:48.180
I have vanquished the Heffalump.

01:02:48.347 --> 01:02:50.349
Well, of course, we all knew really!

01:02:50.516 --> 01:02:52.434
We knew you'd dump that lump.

01:02:52.601 --> 01:02:54.895
- Only Christopher Robin can beat a Heffalump!
- I never lost hope.

01:02:55.062 --> 01:02:56.313
- We missed you!
- I've missed you, too.

01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:57.815
All of you.

01:02:57.982 --> 01:02:58.983
Very much.

01:02:59.650 --> 01:03:01.235
You've grown up well.

01:03:01.402 --> 01:03:03.529
So glad we're all back together again.

01:03:03.696 --> 01:03:05.322
But where's Pooh?

01:03:05.489 --> 01:03:07.908
Yes, of course, Piglet.
Well, Pooh...

01:03:08.867 --> 01:03:10.452
I lost him.

01:03:10.619 --> 01:03:11.745
- He's lost him?
- Oh, dear.

01:03:11.912 --> 01:03:13.038
Where exactly did you lose him?

01:03:13.205 --> 01:03:15.332
Concentrate.
Let's all work together, please.

01:03:15.499 --> 01:03:17.918
I'll get searching.
Tiggers are the best searchers.

01:03:18.085 --> 01:03:20.713
You're Christopher Robin.
You'll find him.

01:03:20.921 --> 01:03:22.089
Somewhere.

01:03:23.090 --> 01:03:24.341
Somewhere.

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.051
Well, that's it, Roo.

01:03:26.218 --> 01:03:28.429
Pooh's waiting for Somewhere to find him.

01:03:28.595 --> 01:03:31.473
And I think I know just where Somewhere is.

01:03:39.189 --> 01:03:41.108
There he is.

01:03:41.275 --> 01:03:43.027
Waiting for you.

01:04:06.008 --> 01:04:07.801
Hello, Pooh.

01:04:07.968 --> 01:04:10.554
Hello, Christopher Robin.

01:04:13.432 --> 01:04:16.643
I'm so sorry, Pooh.
I'm so terribly sorry.

01:04:16.810 --> 01:04:18.979
I should never have shouted at you.

01:04:19.146 --> 01:04:22.941
Well, I am a bear of very little brain.

01:04:23.108 --> 01:04:25.235
No, Pooh.

01:04:25.402 --> 01:04:29.323
You are, I think,
a bear of very big heart.

01:04:32.326 --> 01:04:35.204
You'll be happy to hear
that everyone's safe and sound.

01:04:35.371 --> 01:04:39.041
I saved them from a Heffalump
which was, in fact, well, me.

01:04:39.208 --> 01:04:40.626
And Owl's weather vane.

01:04:40.793 --> 01:04:43.253
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:47.508
But I am rather glad that I was here.

01:04:47.674 --> 01:04:49.676
Waiting for you.

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:54.264
Thank you for waiting for me, Pooh.

01:04:54.431 --> 01:04:56.600
It's always a sunny day...

01:04:56.767 --> 01:05:00.687
when Christopher Robin comes to play.

01:05:02.606 --> 01:05:04.858
Not so sure about that.

01:05:07.111 --> 01:05:08.946
I'm not who I used to be.

01:05:09.113 --> 01:05:10.489
Of course you are.

01:05:10.656 --> 01:05:12.324
You're our friend.

01:05:12.491 --> 01:05:15.577
Look at how you saved everybody today.

01:05:15.744 --> 01:05:18.205
You are our hero.

01:05:18.914 --> 01:05:21.166
I'm not a hero, Pooh.

01:05:22.626 --> 01:05:24.545
I'm lost.

01:05:24.711 --> 01:05:26.922
But I found you.

01:05:27.423 --> 01:05:29.049
Didn't I?

01:05:51.447 --> 01:05:55.451
You're squashing me again.

01:06:01.623 --> 01:06:03.125
May we wake them?

01:06:06.879 --> 01:06:08.589
Pooh.Pooh!

01:06:08.755 --> 01:06:10.132
It's me, Piglet.

01:06:12.468 --> 01:06:14.720
- Wakey, wakey.
- Good morning, Piglet.

01:06:19.266 --> 01:06:21.643
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:06:21.852 --> 01:06:24.021
- What is it?
- It's tomorrow!

01:06:24.188 --> 01:06:25.647
It's usually today.

01:06:25.814 --> 01:06:27.816
Well, yes, of course it's today.

01:06:27.983 --> 01:06:31.737
But that means I slept here,
and I'm meant to be in the office in...

01:06:31.904 --> 01:06:33.489
Oh, blast! How did I let this happen?

01:06:33.655 --> 01:06:35.115
- He's overslept!
- Where's my briefcase?

01:06:35.282 --> 01:06:36.867
Owl, you've been up all night.

01:06:37.034 --> 01:06:38.869
- You should've squawked!
- Don't you worry.

01:06:39.036 --> 01:06:41.497
As my old Uncle Orville used to say...

01:06:41.663 --> 01:06:44.666
"Worry is the way to concern."

01:06:44.833 --> 01:06:47.961
Or is it,
"Concern is the way to confusion?"

01:06:48.128 --> 01:06:49.421
You're the way to confusion.

01:06:49.588 --> 01:06:51.798
We've got all your belongings
all nice and dried out.

01:06:51.965 --> 01:06:53.509
Tigger helped me get you all sorted.

01:06:53.675 --> 01:06:55.344
I sure did.

01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:57.387
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

01:06:57.554 --> 01:06:59.848
I could never have forgotten
my case of important things.

01:07:00.015 --> 01:07:02.893
I'm sorry I have to go,
but I've already stayed far too long.

01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:05.312
Pooh, you should keep this.

01:07:05.479 --> 01:07:08.190
That way, if you lose someone,
you'll be able to find them again.

01:07:08.899 --> 01:07:11.568
Thank you, Christopher Robin.

01:07:11.735 --> 01:07:13.737
And you should take this.

01:07:13.904 --> 01:07:15.280
For Madeline.

01:07:15.447 --> 01:07:17.241
What's a Madeline?

01:07:17.407 --> 01:07:20.619
Is it more important
than your case of important things?

01:07:20.786 --> 01:07:23.622
Madeline's my daughter, so, yes,
of course.

01:07:23.789 --> 01:07:27.334
Absolutely.
She means the world to me.

01:07:27.501 --> 01:07:30.212
Then why isn't she with you?

01:07:32.839 --> 01:07:34.591
She has work to do, Roo.

01:07:34.758 --> 01:07:37.135
- Oh, the poor dear.
- No, no.

01:07:37.302 --> 01:07:39.304
She likes work.

01:07:41.765 --> 01:07:43.392
Look, I've got to hurry.

01:07:43.559 --> 01:07:45.644
Goodbye, everyone.
It's so nice to see you all again.

01:07:45.811 --> 01:07:47.729
Goodbye, Christopher.

01:07:48.814 --> 01:07:49.856
Good bye!

01:08:27.685 --> 01:08:28.604
Father?

01:08:29.729 --> 01:08:31.857
Father, is that you?

01:08:33.524 --> 01:08:34.443
Yes.

01:08:34.609 --> 01:08:36.153
What are you doing here?

01:08:36.569 --> 01:08:37.946
Well...

01:08:38.613 --> 01:08:40.573
I was...

01:08:40.741 --> 01:08:42.658
Were you in the woods?

01:08:42.826 --> 01:08:45.828
Yes, I was.
But I'm terribly sorry...

01:08:47.788 --> 01:08:48.665
Hello.

01:08:49.957 --> 01:08:51.667
I've really got to go.

01:08:52.961 --> 01:08:54.504
You can't stay?

01:08:54.671 --> 01:08:57.924
I can't, darling. There's an 11:00 meeting
I'm terribly late for.

01:08:58.091 --> 01:08:59.718
I'm so sorry.
Madeline?

01:09:00.886 --> 01:09:02.554
Madeline?

01:09:03.263 --> 01:09:05.057
Oh, gosh.

01:09:05.223 --> 01:09:07.017
I'm sorry, darling.
I never meant for her to see me.

01:09:07.184 --> 01:09:08.477
I've really got to make the next train.

01:09:08.644 --> 01:09:09.685
Well, you better go then.

01:09:10.687 --> 01:09:12.439
There's a good explanation
for all of this.

01:09:12.606 --> 01:09:13.899
I'd love to hear it.

01:09:14.649 --> 01:09:16.984
Well, I was...

01:09:18.403 --> 01:09:22.698
Well, it's a little complicated.
I suppose I can't right now.

01:09:24.201 --> 01:09:27.203
I was thinking that Madeline
and I should stay longer.

01:09:27.371 --> 01:09:29.331
Do you think that's really
for the best?

01:09:29.497 --> 01:09:30.499
I do.

01:09:30.666 --> 01:09:32.834
- For how long?
- I don't know, Christopher.

01:09:33.542 --> 01:09:35.879
- Evelyn!
- You're going to miss your train.

01:09:59.695 --> 01:10:01.196
How's it going in here?

01:10:01.363 --> 01:10:04.366
Fine. Wonderful.
Everything's just perfect!

01:10:05.492 --> 01:10:07.244
Yeah, I can see that.

01:10:20.465 --> 01:10:25.095
It's hard to imagine your father
as a child, isn't it?

01:10:25.262 --> 01:10:27.013
Are you sure he ever was one?

01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:28.390
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:10:28.557 --> 01:10:31.643
Well, I'm pretty sure.

01:10:36.857 --> 01:10:39.818
I'm sorry he couldn't stay.

01:10:39.985 --> 01:10:42.320
Your father...

01:10:42.946 --> 01:10:46.199
He's having a bit of a hard time of it.

01:10:46.366 --> 01:10:48.618
Then he should have come
and spent the weekend with us.

01:10:48.785 --> 01:10:50.537
We would've made him feel better.

01:10:50.704 --> 01:10:53.039
It's not always that simple.

01:10:54.291 --> 01:10:56.418
He will come back to us, though.

01:10:57.502 --> 01:10:59.004
I know it.

01:10:59.171 --> 01:11:01.423
Boarding school starts soon.

01:11:02.299 --> 01:11:04.760
There's not a lot of time left.

01:11:09.556 --> 01:11:13.310
That's why you should go and play.

01:11:14.478 --> 01:11:16.188
- Play?
- Yes.

01:11:16.354 --> 01:11:19.357
Dirty, mucky play.
I expect you to come back filthy.

01:11:23.111 --> 01:11:27.866
Yes. I'm going to play better and harder
than any child has ever played before.

01:11:28.033 --> 01:11:30.035
Or, you know, have fun.

01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:32.704
Right. Fun.

01:11:32.871 --> 01:11:34.498
How exactly do I do that?

01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:39.127
Go explore. I'm sure your father found
loads of things to play with around here...

01:11:39.294 --> 01:11:40.754
when he was your age.

01:11:43.632 --> 01:11:46.593
I don't feel much like Pooh today.

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:50.096
There, there, I'll bring you tea
and honey until you do.

01:11:50.263 --> 01:11:51.932
That's an idea, Piglet.

01:11:52.098 --> 01:11:55.310
One Tigger-knot coming right up.
This is the crucial part.

01:11:55.477 --> 01:11:57.020
It's too tight.

01:11:57.187 --> 01:12:00.690
Eeyore, you've got a something...

01:12:00.857 --> 01:12:02.067
on your back.

01:12:02.234 --> 01:12:03.860
Rain protection.

01:12:04.027 --> 01:12:06.154
- What do you think?
- I know what I think.

01:12:06.321 --> 01:12:09.866
But those are Christopher Robin's
important papers.

01:12:10.033 --> 01:12:11.993
Oh, Tigger, what have you done now?

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:16.122
Well, I needed to make room in his briefcase
for the real important stuff.

01:12:16.289 --> 01:12:19.918
You know, things to remember us by.
Not the flippity-flop papers.

01:12:20.126 --> 01:12:23.129
But without them,
the Woozles will eat him for breakfast.

01:12:24.089 --> 01:12:26.716
Oh, no!
Pooh, what do we do?

01:12:38.478 --> 01:12:39.646
Tree.

01:12:39.813 --> 01:12:41.773
Sheep.

01:12:42.524 --> 01:12:43.859
Cow.

01:12:44.442 --> 01:12:45.902
Woman with dog.

01:13:03.336 --> 01:13:04.796
Tree.

01:13:06.423 --> 01:13:07.924
Sheep.

01:13:09.092 --> 01:13:10.218
Cow.

01:13:11.887 --> 01:13:13.096
Bridge.

01:13:17.893 --> 01:13:19.561
Is it all tied up
nice and tight?

01:13:19.728 --> 01:13:21.771
Well, of course!
I used a Tigger-knot.

01:13:21.938 --> 01:13:23.315
The strongest knot known.

01:13:23.982 --> 01:13:26.067
Does this make me look husky?

01:13:26.234 --> 01:13:28.194
You look like a sad house.

01:13:28.361 --> 01:13:31.156
Pooh, are you sure
we need to go to Lon Don?

01:13:31.323 --> 01:13:32.991
Oh, yes, Piglet.

01:13:33.158 --> 01:13:35.452
Christopher Robin always comes
to save us.

01:13:35.619 --> 01:13:37.203
Now, it's our turn to save him.

01:13:37.370 --> 01:13:41.666
We're probably too late.
I'd say they've eaten him already.

01:13:41.833 --> 01:13:44.502
Come on, then!
Bounce faster, Eeyore.

01:13:44.669 --> 01:13:46.504
- We've gotta get this to Christopher Robin.
- I've only got one speed.

01:13:46.671 --> 01:13:48.048
We're right behind you, Tigger.

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:50.884
I'm not sure I'm going to go.

01:13:51.051 --> 01:13:52.928
No, I think I might stay.

01:13:53.094 --> 01:13:55.221
I'm actually going to definitely stay.

01:13:55.388 --> 01:13:58.642
There, there, Piglet.
Come on. Here.

01:13:58.808 --> 01:14:00.393
We need you.

01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:02.103
You need me?

01:14:03.355 --> 01:14:05.065
Well, if you need me...

01:14:05.231 --> 01:14:07.859
We always need you, Piglet.

01:14:08.026 --> 01:14:09.277
Thank you, Pooh.

01:14:09.444 --> 01:14:13.156
And wait till you see London.
So many balloons.

01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:16.910
It's Madeline Robin
serving for the Wimbledon title.

01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:21.039
And it's an ace!
She's won!

01:14:21.206 --> 01:14:23.625
The crowd goes wild!

01:14:24.167 --> 01:14:27.170
- Hip hip hooray! Hip hip hooray!
- The crowd goes wild!

01:14:28.046 --> 01:14:29.255
Which way is Wimbledon?

01:14:29.422 --> 01:14:31.091
- Be quiet.
- What do you mean, "shh?"

01:14:32.258 --> 01:14:33.426
Hello?

01:14:33.969 --> 01:14:35.595
That's a Madeline.

01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:41.142
You're crushing the papers.

01:14:41.309 --> 01:14:42.852
Hello?

01:14:43.019 --> 01:14:44.145
She doesn't know we're here.

01:14:44.312 --> 01:14:45.271
Quiet, Piglet.

01:14:46.898 --> 01:14:48.191
Oh, she's very good.

01:14:48.358 --> 01:14:50.777
- Who's in there?
- Throw it back.

01:14:54.197 --> 01:14:56.408
- No pushing. We might fall...
- Okay, easy. Tail...

01:15:02.831 --> 01:15:04.082
Oh, hello!

01:15:04.499 --> 01:15:06.459
Congratulations on Wimbledon.

01:15:06.626 --> 01:15:08.545
You must be a Madeline.

01:15:09.796 --> 01:15:10.880
Danger!

01:15:11.047 --> 01:15:12.132
I'm ever so sorry.

01:15:12.298 --> 01:15:14.884
We're sorry.
We didn't mean to interrupt your games.

01:15:19.264 --> 01:15:21.016
You're talking.

01:15:21.182 --> 01:15:24.227
Me? No, I'm not talking.

01:15:24.394 --> 01:15:26.730
Well, I am now, I suppose.

01:15:26.896 --> 01:15:28.898
Wait. I recognize you.

01:15:30.942 --> 01:15:33.194
You're the bear in my father's drawings.

01:15:33.361 --> 01:15:34.946
Winnie the Pooh.

01:15:35.113 --> 01:15:36.364
Pooh for short.

01:15:36.531 --> 01:15:38.116
This is Piglet.

01:15:38.283 --> 01:15:40.910
- Eeyore...
- Wait for me!

01:15:43.371 --> 01:15:44.330
Oh, dear.

01:15:44.497 --> 01:15:47.375
And I'm Tigger,
T-I-double G-UHR!

01:15:47.542 --> 01:15:48.626
What's a Tigger?

01:15:48.793 --> 01:15:49.961
I'm glad you asked.

01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:52.630
Please, not the song.

01:15:53.089 --> 01:15:56.426
<i>The wonderful thing about Tiggers is
Tiggers are wonderful things</i>

01:15:56.593 --> 01:15:59.304
<i>Their tops are made outta rubber
Their bottoms are made outta springs</i>

01:15:59.471 --> 01:16:02.932
<i>They're bouncy, flouncy, trouncy, pouncy
Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun</i>

01:16:03.099 --> 01:16:06.061
<i>But the most wonderful thing
about Tiggers is</i>

01:16:06.227 --> 01:16:07.687
<i>I'm the only one</i>

01:16:07.854 --> 01:16:09.314
He does that a lot.

01:16:09.481 --> 01:16:10.732
I'm the only one.

01:16:10.899 --> 01:16:12.609
Well, hello, everyone.

01:16:12.776 --> 01:16:15.278
Did the red balloon make you happy?

01:16:15.445 --> 01:16:18.114
Balloons make me very happy.

01:16:20.158 --> 01:16:21.826
- That was from you?
- No.

01:16:21.993 --> 01:16:23.912
It was from Christopher Robin.

01:16:24.079 --> 01:16:25.246
My father was with you?

01:16:25.413 --> 01:16:26.414
Oh, yes.

01:16:26.581 --> 01:16:28.500
He was helping me to find my friends.

01:16:28.666 --> 01:16:30.543
And he saved us from the Heffalump.

01:16:30.710 --> 01:16:31.669
A Heffa-what?

01:16:31.836 --> 01:16:33.421
But he left his important papers...

01:16:33.922 --> 01:16:36.216
which might have been a smidge my fault.

01:16:36.382 --> 01:16:37.884
It was your fault.

01:16:38.051 --> 01:16:40.303
So we're going on an expotition to Lon Don.

01:16:42.347 --> 01:16:43.807
If we don't get the papers to him...

01:16:43.973 --> 01:16:47.102
a Woozle is going to eat him
for breakfast.

01:16:47.268 --> 01:16:48.603
A Woozle...

01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:50.188
You must mean a Winslow.

01:16:50.355 --> 01:16:52.107
Exactly. A Woozle.

01:16:52.273 --> 01:16:54.609
He's going to be awfully glad
to get them back.

01:16:55.860 --> 01:16:58.905
Come on, let's bounce!
We haven't got a moment to lose.

01:16:59.072 --> 01:17:00.156
Which way do we go?

01:17:00.698 --> 01:17:04.452
Christopher Robin said
we should head north.

01:17:04.911 --> 01:17:07.997
London's northwest actually.

01:17:08.164 --> 01:17:09.707
The train station is south.

01:17:10.333 --> 01:17:12.043
I don't know south.

01:17:12.210 --> 01:17:14.337
Don't worry, I do.

01:17:14.796 --> 01:17:17.632
<i>On an expotition to father's work,
got his papers. Be back soon.</i>

01:17:19.968 --> 01:17:21.803
I'm going to close my eyes.

01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:23.221
Pretty quickity-quick.

01:17:23.388 --> 01:17:25.348
This is faster than most expotitions.

01:17:25.515 --> 01:17:27.267
Nice to feel the wind in your fur.

01:17:27.433 --> 01:17:29.936
Come on, Madeline.
Let's see what this thing can do.

01:17:31.187 --> 01:17:32.647
Maddy!

01:17:32.814 --> 01:17:35.400
Maddy, would you like some lemonade?

01:17:45.994 --> 01:17:47.453
Remember "Naptime."

01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:48.913
Tiggers make the best nappers.

01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:50.373
One ticket to London, please.

01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:51.541
Five shillings, please.

01:17:53.209 --> 01:17:54.878
Right where I belong.

01:17:55.211 --> 01:17:56.337
Grand.

01:17:58.298 --> 01:17:59.966
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

01:18:00.133 --> 01:18:01.426
Thank you.

01:18:09.434 --> 01:18:12.437
Stand clear for the departing train.

01:18:21.946 --> 01:18:23.448
Does this world ever slow down?

01:18:24.782 --> 01:18:26.951
Play "Naptime."
Play "Naptime."

01:18:27.785 --> 01:18:29.287
- Hello, Miss.
- Hello.

01:18:29.454 --> 01:18:31.497
Can I get you anything from the trolley?

01:18:31.664 --> 01:18:34.042
I'd like five cups of tea, please.

01:18:34.834 --> 01:18:36.419
Of course!

01:18:36.586 --> 01:18:38.630
And some milk, and sugar...

01:18:38.796 --> 01:18:40.757
And honey.

01:18:40.924 --> 01:18:43.343
Honey, please.
Lots of honey.

01:18:52.435 --> 01:18:54.479
And the game is called,
"Say What You See."

01:18:54.646 --> 01:18:56.147
You first, Piglet.

01:18:56.648 --> 01:18:58.274
Panic. Worry.

01:18:58.441 --> 01:18:59.859
Catastrophe.

01:19:00.026 --> 01:19:02.654
Speed! Danger! Recklessness!

01:19:02.820 --> 01:19:06.199
Disgrace. Shame. Humiliation.

01:19:06.366 --> 01:19:07.951
Well, that's one way to play it.

01:19:08.117 --> 01:19:10.870
There's going to be no fun
like this at boarding school, Pooh.

01:19:12.372 --> 01:19:16.084
Why not just not go to boring school?

01:19:16.751 --> 01:19:18.503
If I can get these papers to Father...

01:19:18.670 --> 01:19:22.590
then maybe he'll be so happy
that he won't make me go.

01:19:22.966 --> 01:19:24.467
Dreams don't come for free, Pooh.

01:19:25.134 --> 01:19:26.803
You've got to fight for them.

01:19:26.970 --> 01:19:28.972
Nothing comes from nothing.

01:19:29.138 --> 01:19:30.056
Yes.

01:19:30.223 --> 01:19:34.060
Doing nothing often leads to
the very best something.

01:19:34.227 --> 01:19:36.354
What?
Who told you that?

01:19:36.521 --> 01:19:38.273
Christopher Robin.

01:19:38.731 --> 01:19:40.650
That doesn't sound like Father.

01:19:40.817 --> 01:19:44.320
He also said that your happiness
means the world to him.

01:19:45.113 --> 01:19:46.447
He sure did.

01:19:46.614 --> 01:19:48.241
That's right.
He said that.

01:19:55.665 --> 01:19:56.833
Hold the lift, please.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.042
Yes, sir.

01:19:58.209 --> 01:19:59.210
Thank you.

01:19:59.377 --> 01:20:00.795
Ready for the presentation, Robin?

01:20:00.962 --> 01:20:02.297
Yes. It's all in here, sir.

01:20:10.346 --> 01:20:13.057
Well, see you on the dance floor.

01:20:13.224 --> 01:20:14.392
We're all counting on you.

01:20:34.203 --> 01:20:35.997
Who are these people?

01:20:36.164 --> 01:20:37.040
It's so loud!

01:20:37.206 --> 01:20:39.542
Welcome to Lon Don.

01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:41.586
How come nobody's bouncing?

01:20:51.721 --> 01:20:53.139
Winslow Luggage, please.

01:20:54.098 --> 01:20:55.183
On Torrington Street.

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:57.268
<i>Whatever you say, guv' nah.</i>

01:21:00.396 --> 01:21:02.482
Where are you, Maddy?

01:21:20.166 --> 01:21:22.168
Come on, mate.
I haven't got all day.

01:21:22.335 --> 01:21:23.711
I'm not doing this for fun, you know?

01:21:23.878 --> 01:21:25.046
Hey, what the...?

01:21:25.213 --> 01:21:26.547
There's a Tigger looking right at me.

01:21:26.714 --> 01:21:28.216
But I'm the only one!

01:21:28.383 --> 01:21:30.051
- What are you doing?
- Tigger, be quiet.

01:21:30.218 --> 01:21:32.595
I just saw
the most preposterous imposterator.

01:21:32.762 --> 01:21:34.013
- Tigger.
- What's that, love?

01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:36.641
Nothing.

01:21:36.808 --> 01:21:38.476
I'm just talking to my teddies.

01:21:38.643 --> 01:21:40.603
There's another one! Look at him.

01:21:40.770 --> 01:21:42.438
His eyes are too close together.

01:21:42.605 --> 01:21:45.691
Look at his big, silly nose,
and his flippy-floppy ears.

01:21:45.858 --> 01:21:46.984
That's not very nappy.

01:21:47.151 --> 01:21:48.403
Look at that silly stripe.

01:21:49.946 --> 01:21:51.239
Imposterator!

01:21:52.782 --> 01:21:56.244
- Calm down.
- Now is not the time for napping, Madeline.

01:21:56.619 --> 01:21:57.703
I wanna look him straight in the eye.

01:21:57.870 --> 01:21:58.913
Oh, he's not stopping!

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:00.540
No, he won't.

01:22:00.706 --> 01:22:03.251
My kinda speed!
Follow that Tigger!

01:22:04.752 --> 01:22:06.254
You're losing him!

01:22:12.093 --> 01:22:13.803
Perfect! You exploded him!

01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:14.971
Good morning.

01:22:15.763 --> 01:22:16.722
Thank you for the ride.

01:22:16.889 --> 01:22:18.433
- Is everyone all right?
- Cheese and crackers.

01:22:18.599 --> 01:22:20.768
My neck, my back!
I can't feel my toes.

01:22:21.144 --> 01:22:23.354
That was so much fun!
Let's do it again!

01:22:23.521 --> 01:22:24.981
Marvelous, mate.

01:22:25.148 --> 01:22:26.357
Thank you very much indeed.

01:22:26.524 --> 01:22:28.776
That's fantastic.
This is my livelihood!

01:22:28.943 --> 01:22:31.070
What in the blue blazes is going on here?

01:22:31.237 --> 01:22:32.572
Officer, thank goodness you're here.

01:22:32.738 --> 01:22:34.532
I don't think we played "Naptime"
very well.

01:22:34.699 --> 01:22:36.409
You need to arrest this lot here.

01:22:36.576 --> 01:22:37.869
Immediately.

01:22:38.035 --> 01:22:40.913
What? This little girl with her stuffed
animals is givin' you the fear, is she?

01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:43.291
No, no, there's something strange
going on with them.

01:22:43.458 --> 01:22:45.168
Something spooky.

01:22:45.334 --> 01:22:46.544
Are you on the lemonade, mate?

01:22:46.961 --> 01:22:48.921
Madeline, look!

01:22:49.088 --> 01:22:50.298
Doesn't that say "Woozle?"

01:22:51.632 --> 01:22:53.551
- What are you incinerating?
- Incinerating?

01:22:53.718 --> 01:22:55.303
Yeah, what are you incinerating about me?

01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:57.263
- No, no, I think you've got the wrong word.
- Excuse me.

01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:59.015
- Officer?
- Yes, my darling?

01:22:59.724 --> 01:23:01.350
That's my father there.

01:23:01.517 --> 01:23:03.436
Okay, well, off you pop.

01:23:03.603 --> 01:23:04.604
And be careful.

01:23:04.770 --> 01:23:06.147
I will.
Thank you, Officer.

01:23:06.314 --> 01:23:07.982
- Thank you.
- Thank you, orifice.

01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:09.609
What a nice man.

01:23:09.775 --> 01:23:11.402
Here's me cabbie license.
You don't believe me?

01:23:11.736 --> 01:23:14.447
That is a certificate of excellent...

01:23:14.989 --> 01:23:16.699
There's that face.
I did that face.

01:23:16.866 --> 01:23:17.950
You seen him.

01:23:18.117 --> 01:23:19.619
You saw, didn't you?
You saw.

01:23:19.785 --> 01:23:22.288
You have witnessed
the peculiarity, haven't ya?

01:23:22.455 --> 01:23:23.623
What did we see?

01:23:23.789 --> 01:23:25.249
- The bear talking.
- Little teddy bear.

01:23:25.416 --> 01:23:27.251
No, you didn't. You saw no such thing.

01:23:27.418 --> 01:23:28.878
- Talking.
- No, it was not.

01:23:29.045 --> 01:23:30.046
- It was.
- That's right, write it down.

01:23:30.213 --> 01:23:31.631
- It wasn't. We misheard it.
- There was a pig as well.

01:23:31.797 --> 01:23:33.341
- There was a pig.
- It was a talking pig.

01:23:37.303 --> 01:23:38.221
As you were.

01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:41.057
Right, we all know why we're here.

01:23:41.849 --> 01:23:45.186
No one wants to see
the Winslow Luggage ship sink...

01:23:45.353 --> 01:23:48.439
so hard decisions must be made.

01:23:48.606 --> 01:23:52.151
Now, Robin and I worked tirelessly
the whole weekend on this.

01:23:52.318 --> 01:23:54.862
But I don't want to take all the credit...

01:23:55.029 --> 01:23:57.490
so I'll let Robin present our solutions.

01:23:58.366 --> 01:24:01.577
We're never gonna find Christopher Robin
inside this box.

01:24:02.370 --> 01:24:04.413
Can you see any of the others?

01:24:05.414 --> 01:24:08.042
Hello? How are you getting on in there?

01:24:08.209 --> 01:24:10.253
Dark. Gloomy.

01:24:10.419 --> 01:24:12.296
You should just leave me here.

01:24:13.422 --> 01:24:14.715
Don't leave us. Tigger!
Lift it, lift it!

01:24:14.882 --> 01:24:17.802
I got you, Piglet.
Don't worry. Ain't too heavy for Tigger.

01:24:17.969 --> 01:24:19.637
- Thank goodness.
- Tiggers are strong!

01:24:19.804 --> 01:24:22.223
Sit tight, and we'll be there soon.

01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:23.558
Sit tight?
What does that mean?

01:24:23.724 --> 01:24:25.518
It means stay right here
in this very, very safe box.

01:24:25.685 --> 01:24:26.686
Tiggers don't sit tight.

01:24:26.852 --> 01:24:29.105
Tiggers barely sit at all.
I gotta tell her.

01:24:29.605 --> 01:24:31.274
Madeline!

01:24:31.691 --> 01:24:33.192
My tail is trapped!

01:24:33.776 --> 01:24:36.195
Pooh?
Did you hear that?

01:24:36.362 --> 01:24:39.532
It's hard to hear anything
above my tummy rumbling.

01:24:39.907 --> 01:24:42.618
Don't worry. I'll get us.outta this mess!

01:24:42.785 --> 01:24:45.496
Madeline said to sit tight
and she's the Wimbledon Champion!

01:24:45.663 --> 01:24:48.207
The good news is
that I've found some cuts.

01:24:48.374 --> 01:24:52.420
But it's not going to be easy.
We'll have to reduce overheads...

01:24:52.587 --> 01:24:54.547
and find cheaper suppliers.

01:24:55.214 --> 01:24:57.842
There'll be sacrifices to be made
in terms of our workforce.

01:24:58.009 --> 01:24:59.093
He's talking about me.

01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:00.845
- Yes, I think he probably is.
- Oh, dear.

01:25:01.012 --> 01:25:02.888
Sacrifices are fine, Robin.

01:25:03.389 --> 01:25:06.142
Just show us the proposals.

01:25:07.893 --> 01:25:08.811
Right.

01:25:10.229 --> 01:25:12.690
It's all here. In my papers.

01:25:15.443 --> 01:25:17.361
They are a tad rushed...

01:25:17.987 --> 01:25:20.031
so I'd bear with me.

01:25:20.197 --> 01:25:21.741
Hold on.

01:25:26.829 --> 01:25:27.997
Robin.

01:25:28.164 --> 01:25:28.998
Oh, no!

01:25:29.915 --> 01:25:31.083
Robin!

01:25:31.250 --> 01:25:34.045
If we don't solve the issue,
we'll have no choice but to shut down!

01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:36.130
What have you got?

01:25:38.716 --> 01:25:39.759
Well, sir...

01:25:39.925 --> 01:25:42.720
I think what's happened is...

01:25:44.347 --> 01:25:47.516
I'm so sorry, Mr. Robin.
There's an emergency. Your wife is outside.

01:25:47.683 --> 01:25:49.393
She can't find Madeline.

01:25:50.102 --> 01:25:51.228
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have to step outside.

01:25:51.395 --> 01:25:52.396
Please excuse me.

01:25:52.563 --> 01:25:54.649
What the devil are you doing?

01:26:04.325 --> 01:26:06.160
My tail!
You're gonna pull it off!

01:26:06.327 --> 01:26:08.996
No tail lasts forever.

01:26:09.705 --> 01:26:11.791
Bounce with me!
Bounce,bounce,bounce!

01:26:12.083 --> 01:26:14.126
Everybody bounce!

01:26:14.293 --> 01:26:16.003
Careful, Tigger.
Things might get worse!

01:26:16.170 --> 01:26:19.256
Nonsense!
Nothing ever bad came from bouncing.

01:26:21.050 --> 01:26:22.677
It's getting worse.

01:26:24.428 --> 01:26:26.055
This way. Up here.

01:26:31.352 --> 01:26:32.770
Where is she?

01:26:32.937 --> 01:26:35.272
I don't know.
Somewhere between here and the station.

01:26:35.439 --> 01:26:37.316
She's all alone.

01:26:38.984 --> 01:26:40.111
"Expotition?"

01:26:40.277 --> 01:26:42.321
- No, she's not alone.
- Who's she with?

01:26:43.906 --> 01:26:45.282
I wanna go home.

01:26:45.449 --> 01:26:47.952
We'll be fine.
We won't hit anything else.

01:26:53.541 --> 01:26:55.793
Robin was a reasonably good man.

01:26:58.129 --> 01:26:59.922
Shame he went mad.

01:27:00.089 --> 01:27:01.257
Oh, dear.

01:27:01.424 --> 01:27:03.426
The wonderful thing about Tiggers is...

01:27:03.592 --> 01:27:06.095
their tops are made out of rubber,
their bottoms are made out of springs.

01:27:08.764 --> 01:27:10.266
Tail, you're back!

01:27:10.808 --> 01:27:12.226
Tastes like milk.

01:27:12.393 --> 01:27:13.561
I was pretending
that there was a Heffalump.

01:27:13.728 --> 01:27:15.312
But of course,
there wasn't really a Heffalump.

01:27:15.479 --> 01:27:17.314
Are you hearing yourself?
You need to quit.

01:27:17.481 --> 01:27:19.150
I think that decision's
about to be made for me.

01:27:19.442 --> 01:27:21.068
Stick with me, Piglet.
I'll fix this!

01:27:21.235 --> 01:27:22.319
You worry too much.

01:27:22.486 --> 01:27:23.779
We'll never get to Christopher now!

01:27:24.029 --> 01:27:26.741
Maybe we should ask if anyone's seen a bear
or a Tigger or a very small donkey.

01:27:26.907 --> 01:27:28.659
Darling, these creatures aren't real.

01:27:28.826 --> 01:27:30.745
Don't worry.
This is part of the plan.

01:27:30.911 --> 01:27:33.038
- Careful! We don't want to fly out!
- We just need a leap of faith!

01:27:34.707 --> 01:27:36.500
Listen, I will call Dr. Cunningham on Monday.

01:27:36.667 --> 01:27:37.793
I think with the right amount of rest...

01:27:39.879 --> 01:27:41.380
- Christopher!
- Tigger! Eeyore!

01:27:45.009 --> 01:27:46.135
Piglet!

01:27:46.886 --> 01:27:49.305
My plan worked.
I don't know how I do it.

01:27:49.472 --> 01:27:51.098
You must be Christopher Robin's wife.

01:27:52.391 --> 01:27:53.350
How do you do?

01:27:53.559 --> 01:27:55.519
My bum hurts.

01:27:56.145 --> 01:27:57.646
And now this.

01:27:58.731 --> 01:28:00.733
What have we here?
Some sort of medal?

01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:03.068
Voodoo emblem, do you think?

01:28:03.444 --> 01:28:06.113
- Madness takes many forms, Father.
- It does.

01:28:06.614 --> 01:28:09.116
I thought you were working on this, too.

01:28:09.283 --> 01:28:11.243
Don't you have a copy?

01:28:13.913 --> 01:28:16.165
I have an alternative solution.

01:28:16.332 --> 01:28:17.541
I'm listening.

01:28:17.708 --> 01:28:21.754
We fire the entire efficiency department
for a start.

01:28:22.755 --> 01:28:24.131
Let's get going.

01:28:24.298 --> 01:28:25.466
Where's Madeline?

01:28:25.633 --> 01:28:28.344
She's in a truck.
Headed Woozlewards!

01:28:28.761 --> 01:28:29.887
Woozlewards?

01:28:30.763 --> 01:28:32.515
- Winslow's!
- Winslow's!

01:28:32.681 --> 01:28:33.974
Drive to Winslow's.
That's where Madeline will be.

01:28:34.141 --> 01:28:35.017
We're going to Winslow's, yes.

01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:44.902
Where are the others?

01:28:45.069 --> 01:28:47.196
They must've gone off
on their own expotition.

01:28:48.572 --> 01:28:51.575
At least they left us
the important papers.

01:28:51.742 --> 01:28:52.827
We need to get these to Father
right away.

01:28:53.619 --> 01:28:54.620
Come on, Pooh!

01:28:54.912 --> 01:28:56.455
- Christopher?
- Yes, hon?

01:28:56.622 --> 01:28:58.541
- Is that a talking donkey?
- It's Eeyore.

01:28:58.707 --> 01:29:00.584
Eeyore, this is Evelyn, my wife.

01:29:00.751 --> 01:29:02.253
Hello, Evelyn my wife.

01:29:02.878 --> 01:29:05.965
Hello, talking donkey,
how are you doing today?

01:29:06.131 --> 01:29:07.967
Don't get me started.

01:29:24.275 --> 01:29:25.359
We did it, Pooh!

01:29:25.526 --> 01:29:26.527
Oh, yes!

01:29:29.697 --> 01:29:30.698
Oh, no!

01:29:44.837 --> 01:29:46.297
Oh, no!

01:29:48.716 --> 01:29:50.509
Oh, Pooh.

01:29:50.676 --> 01:29:52.469
Poor Christopher.

01:29:57.641 --> 01:29:59.518
I'm so sorry, Madeline.

01:30:00.686 --> 01:30:02.313
- Madeline!
- Christopher Robin!

01:30:02.479 --> 01:30:03.355
Daddy!

01:30:03.522 --> 01:30:05.232
Thank God we found you.

01:30:08.736 --> 01:30:10.362
Are you all right?

01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:14.533
I lost your papers.

01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:15.826
I'm so sorry.

01:30:16.243 --> 01:30:17.202
Madeline!

01:30:17.369 --> 01:30:18.996
Darling, that doesn't matter.

01:30:20.164 --> 01:30:21.999
You're safe.
That's all that's important.

01:30:22.166 --> 01:30:23.959
Not my papers.

01:30:26.086 --> 01:30:28.047
But your work is so important.

01:30:28.672 --> 01:30:31.884
I thought that maybe
if I brought you your papers...

01:30:33.093 --> 01:30:36.013
that you wouldn't send me away,
and then we could all be together.

01:30:39.183 --> 01:30:40.976
I saved a little bit.

01:30:45.147 --> 01:30:46.690
Sweetheart.

01:30:47.232 --> 01:30:49.485
I was wrong about work.

01:30:49.944 --> 01:30:51.320
I was wrong about everything...

01:30:51.487 --> 01:30:53.697
and I'm so sorry.

01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:57.743
I've been a father of very little brain.

01:30:59.495 --> 01:31:01.205
I lost myself, Maddy.

01:31:02.414 --> 01:31:03.874
And I almost lost you.

01:31:04.541 --> 01:31:06.293
My most precious love.

01:31:07.336 --> 01:31:09.088
And I don't want you to go away.

01:31:09.254 --> 01:31:10.464
You don't have to go to boarding school.

01:31:10.631 --> 01:31:13.968
You can stay here with us,
and I'll never let you go.

01:31:26.647 --> 01:31:28.899
And I'll read you
a bedtime story every night.

01:31:29.066 --> 01:31:30.150
I'd like that.

01:31:30.317 --> 01:31:32.861
Though maybe I'll choose from now on.

01:31:33.028 --> 01:31:34.196
All right.

01:31:35.072 --> 01:31:37.074
You gave us a real fright.

01:31:44.999 --> 01:31:48.168
Another disastrous expotition.

01:31:48.377 --> 01:31:49.545
I don't know about that, Eeyore.

01:31:50.129 --> 01:31:51.588
It all depends on how you look at things.

01:31:54.425 --> 01:31:57.011
Mom, did you know that we went to the train
and had a tea party?

01:32:03.475 --> 01:32:04.810
Darling, you're a genius!

01:32:06.895 --> 01:32:07.855
Come on!

01:32:08.022 --> 01:32:09.356
Off we go again.
Righto.

01:32:09.523 --> 01:32:10.399
Come on, it's not too late.

01:32:11.817 --> 01:32:12.985
Wait for me!

01:32:17.614 --> 01:32:19.742
Mr. Robin?

01:32:19.908 --> 01:32:21.076
Come on!

01:32:21.452 --> 01:32:23.370
That floor would be good for bouncing!

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.377
You're back!
Thank goodness.

01:32:37.092 --> 01:32:37.926
Stop!

01:32:38.635 --> 01:32:39.678
I have the answer.

01:32:39.845 --> 01:32:40.888
This better be worth the wait.

01:32:41.055 --> 01:32:43.599
It is, sir.
Because the answer to all your problems...

01:32:44.475 --> 01:32:45.559
is nothing.

01:32:45.726 --> 01:32:46.727
Nothing?

01:32:46.894 --> 01:32:48.645
Nothing comes from nothing, Robin.

01:32:48.812 --> 01:32:49.980
That's where you're wrong.

01:32:50.147 --> 01:32:52.900
Doing nothing
leads to the very best something.

01:32:53.067 --> 01:32:54.735
I told you,
he's gone crackers.

01:32:54.902 --> 01:32:57.154
What happens when people have time off work?

01:32:57.321 --> 01:32:58.947
Nothing to do.

01:32:59.323 --> 01:33:00.616
They go on holiday.

01:33:00.783 --> 01:33:02.951
And what do people need to go on holiday?

01:33:03.994 --> 01:33:05.329
Luggage, Mr. Winslow!

01:33:05.621 --> 01:33:09.416
You employ thousands of people
all across your companies...

01:33:09.583 --> 01:33:11.418
and if you were to give them all
paid holidays...

01:33:11.585 --> 01:33:12.920
Paid holidays?

01:33:13.545 --> 01:33:14.630
At the moment...

01:33:16.048 --> 01:33:18.342
you supply the wealthy.

01:33:18.509 --> 01:33:20.761
And no one else.

01:33:20.928 --> 01:33:22.179
Do you see?

01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:24.848
But now look.

01:33:27.601 --> 01:33:30.020
If we all could afford to go on holiday...

01:33:30.187 --> 01:33:31.605
up here...

01:33:31.772 --> 01:33:34.817
there would be hundreds
and thousands of ordinary people...

01:33:34.983 --> 01:33:38.028
going to the countryside,
to the lakes, and beaches...

01:33:38.195 --> 01:33:40.531
all with their Winslow Luggage.

01:33:40.697 --> 01:33:42.533
And if we made the prices cheaper...

01:33:42.699 --> 01:33:44.868
then everybody could afford to buy them.

01:33:45.202 --> 01:33:46.495
Oh, great.

01:33:46.662 --> 01:33:49.623
Our lovely beaches rammed
with hoi polloi...

01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:52.543
with their gramophones
and bottles of cider.

01:33:52.709 --> 01:33:54.503
Now, now, hold on, Giles.

01:33:54.670 --> 01:33:56.839
Father, please.
This is clearly codswallop!

01:33:57.005 --> 01:33:59.466
You would say that, wouldn't you, Giles?

01:34:00.551 --> 01:34:01.844
And why is that?

01:34:04.304 --> 01:34:05.472
Because you're a Woozle.

01:34:05.639 --> 01:34:08.142
So that's what a Woozle looks like.

01:34:08.308 --> 01:34:11.061
What the devil is a Woozle?

01:34:11.436 --> 01:34:13.856
A Woozle is a slinking, little monster...

01:34:14.022 --> 01:34:16.900
who gets everyone else
to do his work for him...

01:34:17.067 --> 01:34:19.278
and hopes that we forget
what's important in our lives.

01:34:20.529 --> 01:34:22.030
Our families.

01:34:22.197 --> 01:34:23.907
Our dear friends.

01:34:24.074 --> 01:34:25.951
The people who love us.

01:34:26.118 --> 01:34:28.620
The people whom we love.

01:34:28.787 --> 01:34:29.872
We're here to tell you...

01:34:30.038 --> 01:34:31.165
I'm here to tell you...

01:34:31.331 --> 01:34:33.208
that we're not afraid
of Heffalumps and Woozles anymore.

01:34:33.375 --> 01:34:34.376
Are we?

01:34:34.543 --> 01:34:36.920
Dear Lord, he has lost his marbles.

01:34:37.087 --> 01:34:39.047
Has he?

01:34:39.214 --> 01:34:43.093
Let's address the Heffalump in the room,
shall we?

01:34:43.719 --> 01:34:46.138
What were you doing this weekend, Giles?

01:34:46.513 --> 01:34:47.514
What?

01:34:47.890 --> 01:34:49.349
Me?

01:34:50.893 --> 01:34:52.436
I told you I was working.

01:34:55.063 --> 01:34:57.941
Now, I've not heard of a Woozle before, son.

01:34:58.108 --> 01:35:00.611
But by the sound of it, you are one.

01:35:00.777 --> 01:35:02.237
Me? A Woozle?

01:35:02.404 --> 01:35:04.156
Now sit down, Giles.

01:35:09.828 --> 01:35:12.039
Congratulations, Robin.

01:35:12.206 --> 01:35:15.000
I'd like you to start on this immediately.

01:35:15.292 --> 01:35:17.836
Thank you very much, sir.
I look forward to it.

01:35:18.003 --> 01:35:19.755
But first...

01:35:19.922 --> 01:35:22.424
I'm going to be doing nothing
for a while with my family.

01:35:22.591 --> 01:35:26.136
Because when you do nothing...

01:35:26.303 --> 01:35:30.265
it leads to the very best of a something.

01:35:30.807 --> 01:35:31.934
Did I get that right?

01:35:32.100 --> 01:35:33.602
Close enough, sir.

01:35:34.478 --> 01:35:35.479
Are you ready?

01:35:35.646 --> 01:35:36.813
Eeyore.

01:35:38.649 --> 01:35:39.983
Here.

01:35:46.323 --> 01:35:48.075
Now we're ready.

01:35:48.617 --> 01:35:49.618
Come on.

01:35:50.369 --> 01:35:52.287
We're going on holiday. Yes.

01:35:53.247 --> 01:35:55.540
That donkey was staring at me.

01:35:55.707 --> 01:35:58.335
A donkey staring at you?

01:35:58.502 --> 01:36:01.171
Clearly, it's you who've lost your marbles.

01:36:12.307 --> 01:36:14.935
Oh, boy.
It is good to be home.

01:36:15.978 --> 01:36:17.854
Oh, I suppose so.

01:36:18.021 --> 01:36:19.773
Weather's too nice.

01:36:20.857 --> 01:36:22.651
Home sweet home!

01:36:23.610 --> 01:36:24.695
Where have you all been?

01:36:24.861 --> 01:36:26.989
I was about to mount a search party.

01:36:28.490 --> 01:36:29.491
Hello.

01:36:29.658 --> 01:36:30.534
Who's that, Mum?

01:36:30.701 --> 01:36:31.785
That's a little girl.

01:36:33.203 --> 01:36:35.205
I believe that's a Madeline.

01:36:39.543 --> 01:36:42.462
Christopher Robin!
You've brought guests.

01:36:42.838 --> 01:36:44.214
Welcome to Hundred Acre Wood.

01:36:44.381 --> 01:36:45.799
Right, Rabbit.
Fetch tea.

01:36:45.966 --> 01:36:46.967
I beg your pardon?

01:36:47.134 --> 01:36:49.469
You don't get this in Lon Don.

01:36:50.804 --> 01:36:52.180
Go this way, come on.

01:36:55.267 --> 01:36:58.562
Keep north, Christopher.

01:37:02.107 --> 01:37:04.609
Now everyone is happy.

01:37:05.444 --> 01:37:06.987
Owl, would you like some tea?

01:37:07.154 --> 01:37:08.697
- Is it the way I like it?
- Just say yes or no.

01:37:08.864 --> 01:37:09.698
I'll take this to Pooh.

01:37:09.865 --> 01:37:12.576
Come on, Madeline!
I'm gonna show you how to bounce.

01:37:12.743 --> 01:37:14.536
You're gonna jump real high.

01:37:14.703 --> 01:37:15.912
That's right.

01:37:16.121 --> 01:37:17.414
You're almost as good as I am.

01:37:17.622 --> 01:37:20.459
And Tiggers are the best springers
in the world!

01:37:20.625 --> 01:37:22.169
You're a natural, kid.

01:37:22.377 --> 01:37:25.088
- Tigger, just not too high.
- Please, may I have the last jam tart?

01:37:25.255 --> 01:37:27.257
Thank you, Evelyn my wife.

01:37:27.424 --> 01:37:29.259
Look at that! Amazing!

01:37:40.771 --> 01:37:42.230
How did you know?

01:37:50.238 --> 01:37:51.782
Christopher Robin.

01:37:51.948 --> 01:37:54.242
What day is it?

01:37:54.409 --> 01:37:55.827
It's today.

01:37:57.329 --> 01:37:59.664
My favorite day.

01:37:59.915 --> 01:38:01.750
Mine too, Pooh.

01:38:03.126 --> 01:38:04.252
Mine, too.

01:38:05.462 --> 01:38:09.091
Yesterday, when it was tomorrow...

01:38:09.257 --> 01:38:13.512
it was too much day for me.

01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:17.641
Silly old bear.

01:41:05.892 --> 01:41:07.644
I think things are changing.

01:41:08.979 --> 01:41:10.647
And not for the worse.

01:41:11.982 --> 01:41:14.067
Thank ya for noticing me.

01:41:15.155 --> 01:41:20.155
