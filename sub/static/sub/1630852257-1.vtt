- Thank you so much
for house-sitting, Maya.

00:17.892 --> 00:19.227
- Oh, it's my pleasure, Amy.

00:19.269 --> 00:22.063
What a wonderful place
to spend the holidays.

00:22.105 --> 00:24.232
- And I'm here too.

00:24.274 --> 00:25.567
I was just talking to Maya,

00:25.608 --> 00:27.569
and then she disappeared
into a snow globe,

00:27.610 --> 00:29.487
which was magical
but also a little rude.

00:29.529 --> 00:32.323
So then I jumped in after her,
which was scary but also cool.

00:32.365 --> 00:34.576
- Amy, why don't you just stay?

00:34.617 --> 00:36.494
- I've just been spending
so many seasons here

00:36.536 --> 00:38.913
hosting competition shows,
I needed a change of scenery.

00:38.955 --> 00:43.168
- Oh, so do you want me
and Maya to do a show here?

00:43.209 --> 00:45.545
- No, that's okay.
- Are you sure?

00:45.587 --> 00:47.130
I mean,
you're all set up for a show.

00:47.172 --> 00:48.757
- Yeah, and there's, like,
20 camera guys

00:48.798 --> 00:50.175
just sitting out there.

00:50.216 --> 00:51.634

you really shouldn't bother.

00:51.676 --> 00:53.386
I mean, is this
the perfect place

00:53.428 --> 00:55.138

Yes.

09:20.310 --> 09:23.063
- You tell those judges
how good we've done.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.689
- Andy, do you know
the story of Hanukkah?

09:24.731 --> 09:25.899
- I do, yeah.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.484
But I don't want
to tell it right now.

09:27.525 --> 09:28.860
You know, I don't want
to spoil the ending for anyone

09:28.902 --> 09:29.944
who's still reading the Torah.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.237
- Ah, good--
that's a good point.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.781
- Yeah.
I mean, you can pretty much

09:32.822 --> 09:36.034
just, like--like,
bad stuff happens to the Jews.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.827
- Right.
- Then God does a miracle

09:37.869 --> 09:40.246
thing, and then, you know,
we all get together,

09:40.288 --> 09:43.124
like, seven times a year,
complain, and drink wine.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.377
- Sounds fun.
- Yeah.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.128
Yeah. It's not.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.596
- The holidays is all about
people coming together,

09:56.638 --> 09:59.849
so today we're gonna find out
how our bakers celebrate

09:59.891 --> 10:01.935
their holidays,
some of their traditions,

10:01.976 --> 10:03.520
and how they make
the holidays special.

10:03.561 --> 10:06.106
- We celebrate Christmas
as our main holiday.

10:06.147 --> 10:08.692
And our very close
family friends are Italian,

10:08.733 --> 10:10.860
and they celebrate
the Feast of the Seven Fishes

10:10.902 --> 10:11.945
on Christmas Eve.

10:11.986 --> 10:13.446
But we are not Italian,

10:13.488 --> 10:15.073
so we're bringing a little bit
of soul food

10:15.115 --> 10:16.783
to their Italian Seven Fishes.

10:16.825 --> 10:18.118
- Yes.
- Nice.

10:18.159 --> 10:19.994
- We're making
shrimp and grit cream puffs.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.204
<i>- Ooh.
- And then we're actually</i>

10:21.246 --> 10:22.872
<i>bringing in some
of our Latin heritage.</i>

10:22.914 --> 10:24.541
<i>We are half Puerto Rican,</i>

10:24.582 --> 10:26.835
<i>so a little sazon seasoning
on the shrimp.</i>

10:26.876 --> 10:28.753
- So you have
a lot of opportunities

10:28.795 --> 10:29.713
to cook
a lot of different things.

10:29.754 --> 10:30.880
- Oh, my gosh.
- Yes.

10:30.922 --> 10:32.132
- Andy,
why do we celebrate holidays?

10:32.173 --> 10:33.425
Why are holidays special?

10:33.466 --> 10:35.343
- Well, they bring us all
together, you know,

10:35.385 --> 10:37.470
friends and family, which
I think is really important.

10:37.512 --> 10:41.558
You know, it's not some
throwaway Tuesday, you know?

10:41.599 --> 10:44.019
- Do you guys celebrate
the holidays together?

10:44.060 --> 10:45.103
- We do, yeah.
- We get the families together.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.646
- We do
get the families together.

10:46.688 --> 10:49.649
<i>- The day after Christmas,
we celebrate Kwanzaa.</i>

10:49.691 --> 10:53.236
- So this is really a part
of our holiday traditions.

10:53.278 --> 10:55.363
- What are you baking today?
- We are baking blondies.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.782
<i>We put white chocolate.
We put macadamia nuts.</i>

10:57.824 --> 10:59.325
<i>- Okay.
- And to safeguard it</i>

10:59.367 --> 11:04.289
from the children, we top it
with whipped cream with--

11:04.330 --> 11:05.498
- Booze.
- There you go.

11:05.540 --> 11:06.750
- Got it.
- Hey!

11:06.791 --> 11:08.293
- I was gonna say mousetrap.
- There you go.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.337
- I like traditions.
Traditions are fun.

11:10.378 --> 11:14.507
- My family has traditions,
and we tradish them every year.

11:14.549 --> 11:17.427
- I tradish the hell
out of my traditions.

11:17.469 --> 11:18.553
- Yeah.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.305
- Tell us about
your holiday traditions.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.640
- Christmas is huge for us.
- Yeah.

11:22.682 --> 11:26.019
- I'm a little nutso
with Christmas decorations.

11:26.061 --> 11:28.063
I have eight trees.
- Say what, now?

11:28.104 --> 11:29.064
- Yeah, eight.
- Yeah.

11:29.105 --> 11:30.190
Yeah, you heard right, eight.

11:30.231 --> 11:31.566
- Good girl.
- I feel like you are

11:31.608 --> 11:33.193
just wanting
to celebrate Hanukkah.

11:33.234 --> 11:35.195
- That's right.
We might as well convert.

11:35.236 --> 11:37.364
- Look at me, pushing
my Hanukkah agenda again.

11:37.405 --> 11:39.657
- You know what?
- I got to chill out.

11:39.699 --> 11:40.700
- That's what the show is for.

11:40.742 --> 11:42.202
- Absolutely.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.203
- Wow.
- Look at that.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.371
- Yes!
- What do we got here?

11:44.412 --> 11:46.706
- So these are
little pecan tassies.

11:46.748 --> 11:50.210
<i>And we bumped them up
by adding bourbon and bacon.</i>

11:50.251 --> 11:52.212
- Yeah, yeah.
- Did you say bacon?

11:52.253 --> 11:53.505
- The show is called
"Bakin' It."

11:53.546 --> 11:56.216
- We're trying to stay true,
you know?

11:57.467 --> 11:59.844
- Nutmeg, nutmeg,
nutmeg, nutmeg.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.596
Oh, God!
Do you know where nutmeg is?

12:03.181 --> 12:04.724
I'm putting it in.

12:04.766 --> 12:07.185
Hello!
- Hey, how are you?

12:07.227 --> 12:09.145
- Oh, my God, I can't believe.
- Great, how are you?

12:09.187 --> 12:11.022
It's so lovely to meet you.
- Same here.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.607
- Yeah, you too.
- Tell us about yourselves.

12:12.649 --> 12:16.111
- Sure, so we've been married
for about eight years now.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.445
<i>Known each other
for about 11 years.</i>

12:17.487 --> 12:19.072
<i>- 12.
- Originally from--</i>

12:19.114 --> 12:20.407
12.
Originally from India

12:20.448 --> 12:23.118
but moved to the States
here in 2009.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.412
- And we are from Denver.
- Oh, nice.

12:25.453 --> 12:27.038
- Tell us about what you guys
are baking here today.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.415
So we are making

12:28.456 --> 12:30.500
<i>baklava cheesecake
bites.</i>

12:30.542 --> 12:32.669
<i>- So in a baklava,
you're doing a mix</i>

12:32.711 --> 12:35.088
<i>of pistachios,
almonds, and walnuts.</i>

12:35.130 --> 12:39.092
- And the phyllo sheets would
be layered with lots of butter.

12:39.134 --> 12:40.468
- Lot of butter.
Yeah.

12:40.510 --> 12:42.595
- It's kind of a fusion recipe.
- It's a fusion.

12:42.637 --> 12:44.264
- Uh, you know--
- For our traditional

12:44.305 --> 12:46.266
Mediterranean and American dessert.

12:46.307 --> 12:47.642
And it's sort of a tradition--
- And gave it a twist

12:47.684 --> 12:50.145
of cheesecake into it,
and now it's our tradition.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.271
- It's our tradition.

12:51.312 --> 12:52.480
- What did you celebrate
growing up?

12:52.522 --> 12:54.149
What were
your holidays traditions?

12:54.190 --> 12:56.735
- Since we grew up in India,
we celebrate Diwali,

12:56.776 --> 12:58.403
festival of lights.
- That's our main--

12:58.445 --> 12:59.779
that's kind of like
our Christmas,

12:59.821 --> 13:02.115
where we exchange gifts,
we meet our families,

13:02.157 --> 13:03.533
we make a lot of sweets.

13:03.575 --> 13:06.119
- And we also, you know,
celebrate Christmas

13:06.161 --> 13:07.912
with the same zeal
and enthusiasm.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.622
- Yes.
- So multi-diverse

13:09.664 --> 13:11.166
celebration at our home.

13:11.207 --> 13:12.542
- So nice.
So many ways to celebrate.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.336
- Yeah, yeah.
- This is very exciting.

13:14.377 --> 13:16.212
I'm very excited
to try what you make.

13:16.254 --> 13:17.255
- Okay.
- Yeah.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.299
- All right,
let's drown these

13:19.341 --> 13:22.594
in some fat, shall we?

13:23.386 --> 13:25.555
- Don't be stingy.
- Oh, this is looking good.

13:25.597 --> 13:26.598
- Hi.
- Hello, Jonah and Patrick.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.058
- Hi, oh, my God!
- How are you?

13:28.099 --> 13:29.434
- Hi!
- Hi, funny meeting you here.

13:29.476 --> 13:30.977
- Tell us about yourselves.

13:31.019 --> 13:34.189
- So my name is Jonah, and this
is my husband, Patrick.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.816
- We are making a dish today
actually that is a recipe

13:36.858 --> 13:40.320
based off of my mom's mom's
noodle kugel.

13:40.362 --> 13:41.488
<i>- My goodness.
- Do you know--</i>

13:41.529 --> 13:42.947
<i>- I love noodle kugel.
- You do?</i>

13:42.989 --> 13:44.157
<i>- I do.
- Okay, half my family's</i>

13:44.199 --> 13:45.784
Jewish, half is Christian.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.452
I was raised going
to Messianic Jewish

13:47.494 --> 13:49.287
and evangelical Christian
churches.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.122
<i>And I will say, growing up,</i>

13:51.164 --> 13:52.707
I wanted to be
like everybody else.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.668
You know, I didn't like having
this very strange background.

13:54.709 --> 13:57.921
You know, I wanted to be white.
I wanted to be Lutheran.

13:57.962 --> 13:59.255
I wanted to be straight.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.800
I'm Korean and Japanese,
but I was adopted.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.177
<i>So actually, I feel like
I have a lot of party tricks</i>

14:04.219 --> 14:05.720
when it comes to the kitchen

14:05.762 --> 14:08.348
because all of these things
are me.

14:08.390 --> 14:09.724
When people think of,
like, American family

14:09.766 --> 14:11.309
and American food tradition,
they don't think

14:11.351 --> 14:12.602
of families like ours.

14:12.644 --> 14:13.937
- Yes.
- And so we're getting

14:13.978 --> 14:15.105
to, like, show what that
could look like.

14:15.146 --> 14:17.107
- Not anymore.

14:17.148 --> 14:18.358
That ends today!
- Not tonight!

14:18.400 --> 14:20.527
- That's right.
Yeah.

14:20.568 --> 14:22.195
- That's beautiful.
- Yeah.

14:22.237 --> 14:23.363
- And I can really
relate to you.

14:23.405 --> 14:25.365
- I know.
- Aw.

14:25.407 --> 14:27.492
- I know!
- Are we best friends already?

14:27.534 --> 14:29.536
- Beyoncé,
I have loved you for so long.

14:29.577 --> 14:31.871
- Thank you.
- And we are also here.

14:31.913 --> 14:34.082
- Yes, we are, you know.
- Yes.

14:34.124 --> 14:35.709
- Yeah.

14:35.750 --> 14:37.335
- Oh, look at the vanilla bean.
That's nice.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.712
That looks beautiful.
- There's a big old clump,

14:38.753 --> 14:40.380
though, I don't love that,
but it's gonna be cool.

14:40.422 --> 14:41.339
- Whisk it.
Whisk it, girl.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.549
Whisk it.
- I did.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.134
- What are you guys making?
- Pecan tassies.

14:44.175 --> 14:45.802
- Ooh.
- It's really a tradition

14:45.844 --> 14:47.220
that my family has done.

14:47.262 --> 14:48.805
We've done pecan pie every year
since I was little,

14:48.847 --> 14:50.724
and so it's kind of
become my thing now.

14:50.765 --> 14:51.725
- Nice.

14:54.310 --> 14:55.603
- Like we do sometimes.

14:55.645 --> 14:56.730
- Yes.

14:56.771 --> 14:58.356
- That looks good.
- That's beautiful.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.524
- It's coming along.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.192
- You ever had sopes?
- I love them.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.194
- You've had sopes, Tom?
- Yeah, I've had them.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.404
- That makes me
really happy, actually.

15:04.446 --> 15:05.697
- Oh, yeah.
- What are you guys making?

15:05.739 --> 15:07.866
- We're making these
shortbread squares

15:07.907 --> 15:10.785
with fresh raspberries
and lemon mascarpone.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.120
- I'll try the first one.

15:12.162 --> 15:13.413
- This is gonna be
a fun challenge.

15:13.455 --> 15:14.914
We're gonna do our best.

15:14.956 --> 15:16.583
<i>We're competing against
these other bakers,</i>

15:16.624 --> 15:17.834
<i>and so I think
I'm most excited</i>

15:17.876 --> 15:19.502
<i>to see what
they're gonna put out too.</i>

15:19.544 --> 15:22.547
- I want to say, like,
we have the competitive edge,

15:22.589 --> 15:25.759
<i>but I'm honestly leaning
towards, like, having fun.</i>

15:25.800 --> 15:27.052
We don't know
if we're here to win,

15:27.093 --> 15:28.887
but we're here to make friends.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.597
- That's a given. Yeah.

15:30.638 --> 15:32.182
- I have to make sure
all of them are 29 grams

15:32.223 --> 15:33.475
and they'll be the same size.

15:33.516 --> 15:35.560
- Let's cook one first
and see if that works.

15:35.602 --> 15:36.603
- Okay.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.064
- Hello.
- Hi.

15:39.105 --> 15:41.024
- Oh, wow.
How's it going?

15:41.066 --> 15:42.233
- Tell us what you're baking.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.110
- We're making sopes.
- That's right.

15:44.152 --> 15:46.446
<i>- So Cesar and I are Mexican,</i>

15:46.488 --> 15:48.365
<i>and our grandma
always made sopes.</i>

15:48.406 --> 15:49.616
<i>We actually haven't
cooked together.</i>

15:49.657 --> 15:51.409
This is our first time
cooking together.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.786
- Really?
- What, what, what?

15:52.827 --> 15:54.037
- We haven't seen each other
in, like, three years.

15:54.079 --> 15:55.121
- We haven't seen each other
in three years.

15:55.163 --> 15:56.331
- This is a total trial run.

15:56.373 --> 15:57.624
It could work.
It could be a disaster.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.334
- So are you guys, like,
catching up on your lives

15:59.376 --> 16:00.585
while you're doing this?

16:00.627 --> 16:02.128
- Yeah.

16:02.170 --> 16:04.172
We're brother and sister.
I'm older.

16:04.214 --> 16:05.632
We're, like,
seven years between us.

16:05.674 --> 16:09.928
- As kids, Cesar and I
didn't get along that well.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.471
And then we became,
like, a lot closer.

16:11.513 --> 16:12.931
We have, like, a book club.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.558
During the pandemic,
we had, like, virtual dinners.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.102
<i>- Because of COVID,
it was, like, three years</i>

16:17.143 --> 16:18.395
<i>since we had seen each other.</i>

16:18.436 --> 16:20.480
That's why,
regardless of what happens,

16:20.522 --> 16:21.564
we're just happy to be here.

16:21.606 --> 16:23.066
We're happy to be
doing this together.

16:23.108 --> 16:25.151
This is for the books.
This is for the scrapbooks.

16:25.193 --> 16:26.486
We're gonna treasure this.

16:28.613 --> 16:30.657
- Light a menorah
under your butts!

16:30.699 --> 16:32.701
Ten minutes left!

16:33.284 --> 16:35.120
- Oh, shucks, do we want
to just forgo the holly?

16:35.161 --> 16:36.121
Let's forgo the holly.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.372
- Two minutes.

16:37.414 --> 16:38.373
- Can I sneak in here
real quick?

16:38.415 --> 16:39.666
- Sorry, actually, sorry.
This is--

16:39.708 --> 16:41.918
- I want to get in there
so bad.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.503
- This is a private event.

16:43.545 --> 16:45.422
Sorry, you're on the clock.
I'm sorry.

16:45.463 --> 16:46.423
- You're genuinely
on the clock.

16:46.464 --> 16:47.590
- Oh, my God, yes.

16:47.632 --> 16:48.842
- Okay, phew.
- Oh, my God.

16:48.883 --> 16:50.260
That's a good one.
- Add a little bit more

16:50.301 --> 16:51.636
onto this one.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.179
- Five minutes left, bakers.

16:53.221 --> 16:54.431
Or as they say
in the old country,

16:54.472 --> 16:56.141
"What, you wanted longer?"

16:56.182 --> 16:57.600
- This is gonna be
precarious, Tom.

16:57.642 --> 16:58.977
- Hey, you're doing great.

16:59.019 --> 17:01.271
- So are you.
What comes after that, salsa?

17:01.312 --> 17:02.897
Did you season this?
- Yes.

17:02.939 --> 17:04.274
- One more.

17:04.315 --> 17:05.734
Nothing like a little drama
down to the wire.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.235
- Get those ramekins on the--
- Let's get them on.

17:07.277 --> 17:08.611
- Yep.

17:08.653 --> 17:13.700
Five, four, three,
two, one!

17:13.742 --> 17:15.326
- That's it.

17:15.368 --> 17:16.870
- Happy Hannukah!

17:18.747 --> 17:21.416
- Nick of time, baby.
- Absolutely.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.992

18:03.375 --> 18:07.212
<i>I can't believe it, but I have
six wonderful grandchildren.</i>

18:07.253 --> 18:10.006
The oldest is Ben at 19.

Edward will be 19.

and I forgot Michael

<i>Harriet, I would say,

18:28.024 --> 18:30.110
<i>We've been knowing each other

When Harriet and I disagree,
Harriet goes like this.

<i>My whole family says
I'm opinionated.</i>

18:35.615 --> 18:36.783
<i>And they're right.</i>

18:36.825 --> 18:38.118
The grandchildren tell me
all the times,

18:38.159 --> 18:39.327
"Oh, Grandma,
you shouldn't say that."

18:39.369 --> 18:41.371
And I just say,
"Tough [bleep]."

18:41.413 --> 18:43.623
- My oldest is Benjamin.

18:43.665 --> 18:47.419
Benjamin will be 20
in four weeks.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.421
Edward, 19.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.964

<i>If something tastes good
and it looks good,</i>

18:55.301 --> 18:57.512
I mean, it just blows me away,

18:57.554 --> 19:00.181
that's when you gonna get
that Gigi Diggity.

19:00.223 --> 19:02.892
Gigi Diggity's
like the bomb diggity.

19:02.934 --> 19:04.769
It's the bomb.
It's, like, over the top.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.604
It's hittin' every note.

19:06.646 --> 19:10.275
- Michael, 18, and Daniel, 18.

19:10.316 --> 19:12.193
Katie Scarlett is 14.

19:12.235 --> 19:13.486
- I'm Bubbe Norma.

19:13.528 --> 19:16.322
<i>I'm Jewish and part Italian.</i>

19:16.364 --> 19:18.575
So I am tough

19:18.616 --> 19:20.160
but fair.

19:20.201 --> 19:24.122
When it comes to baking,
I have certain standards.

19:24.164 --> 19:28.585
I am particular about the way
I like things baked or tasting.

19:28.626 --> 19:32.130
- Eli, the baby, is 12.

19:32.797 --> 19:36.092
I love my grandchildren
to pieces.

19:38.678 --> 19:42.182
- Now, bakers, it's time
to introduce yourselves

19:42.223 --> 19:43.475
go our grannies.

19:46.478 --> 19:49.939
- Now, our judges are here to
do what grandmothers do best,

19:49.981 --> 19:52.609
judge you because they love you
and think you can do better.

19:52.650 --> 19:54.361
- Exactly.

19:54.402 --> 19:57.781
- They are genuine bakers.

19:57.822 --> 19:59.866
- I mean, how do you judge

19:59.908 --> 20:01.576
between something savory
and something sweet?

20:01.618 --> 20:04.871
- Grannies have to base it
on how it tastes, how it looks,

20:04.913 --> 20:07.207
and how creative it is.

20:07.248 --> 20:09.042
- Niyati and Abhi,

20:09.084 --> 20:12.379
would you please bring up
your bake for us all to taste?

20:12.420 --> 20:14.381
- Ah!
- Oh, my.

20:14.422 --> 20:15.799
<i>- Look at that phyllo.</i>

20:15.840 --> 20:18.176
<i>- Today we have
a baklava cheesecake.</i>

20:18.218 --> 20:21.763
This is a traditional
Mediterranean and American...

20:21.805 --> 20:23.056
- Fusion.
- Fusion.

20:23.098 --> 20:26.059
- It's a trio of almonds,
walnuts, and pistachios.

20:26.101 --> 20:27.519
- And pistachios.
- Oh, my God.

20:27.560 --> 20:28.728
- I just have one comment.

20:31.022 --> 20:33.024
If this was a man,
I would marry it.

20:34.484 --> 20:36.653
The flavor of the butter
comes out in the phyllo dough

20:36.695 --> 20:38.196
so beautifully.

20:38.238 --> 20:41.366
And the cheesecake really
gives it a beautiful balance

20:41.408 --> 20:43.535
because there's the creaminess
and then the nuts

20:43.576 --> 20:44.869
and then the crunchy.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.956
- This is like a taste
of heaven, honestly.

20:47.997 --> 20:50.792
- This is Gigi Diggity.
- Yeah!

20:50.834 --> 20:53.837
- That means this is, like,
fantastic.

20:53.878 --> 20:56.339
- The highest compliment
she can pay.

20:56.381 --> 20:58.717
<i>- It's so golden brown.</i>

20:58.758 --> 21:00.385
- And I see
you're holding hands,

21:00.427 --> 21:01.594
which is so beautiful.

21:01.636 --> 21:03.054
- Aw!
- Is that adorable? Seriously.

21:03.096 --> 21:06.474
- I mean, they really
love each other, you guys.

21:06.516 --> 21:09.519
- I know.

21:09.561 --> 21:11.229
- Sharon and Mike.

21:11.271 --> 21:13.440
Oh, wow!

21:13.481 --> 21:15.233
That's beautiful.

21:15.275 --> 21:20.071
<i>- We made a bourbon bacon
pecan tassie.</i>

21:20.113 --> 21:22.198
<i>- Okay.
I'm loving the bacon on top.</i>

21:22.240 --> 21:23.992
Nice Jewish touch on there.
Yeah.

21:27.704 --> 21:29.914
- I'm used to pecan pies
with more filling.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.750
But this does not bother me,
okay?

21:31.791 --> 21:33.168
- No, this is--
- It's delicious.

21:33.209 --> 21:34.753
I'm not--no,
I'm not knocking it, Harriet.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.963
I'm just saying--

21:37.005 --> 21:39.674
- Here we go.
- But it's--it's good.

21:39.716 --> 21:42.218
- It reminds me
of the pecan pie

21:42.260 --> 21:45.096
that my mom and
my grandmother used to make.

21:45.138 --> 21:47.766
That just reminded me
of home...

21:47.807 --> 21:48.850
- Mm-hmm.
- So much.

21:48.892 --> 21:50.060
I'm even getting sentimental.

21:50.101 --> 21:51.269
I don't need
to do this right now.

21:52.729 --> 21:54.105
- That's what
we were looking for.

21:54.147 --> 21:55.231
- I mean,
it just brings back home to me.

21:55.273 --> 21:56.775
- We're gonna get
everybody here to cry.

21:58.443 --> 22:01.780
- But in a nice way.
- Yeah, in a ni--yes.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.406
- Jonah and Patrick.

22:03.448 --> 22:04.741
- Oh, wow!

22:04.783 --> 22:07.952
- Oh, look at the plates
with the blue glitter.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.538
<i>- Sitting before you
is noodle kugel.</i>

22:10.580 --> 22:12.207
- I'm enjoying it very much.

22:12.248 --> 22:13.958
Truly.
It's really unique.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.794
- Thank you.
- It's really delicious.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.003
I mean, I've never
even heard of this before.

22:17.045 --> 22:18.797
- Isn't it strange
and wonderful?

22:18.838 --> 22:20.632
- It is, it is.
- Like us.

22:20.674 --> 22:22.217
- Yes.

22:22.258 --> 22:24.469
- We love strange
and wonderful.

22:24.511 --> 22:26.596
- I can't believe
you have cornflakes in here.

22:26.638 --> 22:28.139
- I know.

22:28.181 --> 22:29.724
- And you don't have to chew
and chew and chew and chew.

22:29.766 --> 22:34.187
- Sometimes when you make this,
the cornflakes can get tough

22:34.229 --> 22:35.397
and hard to chew.

22:35.438 --> 22:36.856
Tell me, how did you do it

22:36.898 --> 22:39.567
so that yours are so tender
and easy?

22:39.609 --> 22:42.153
- Halfway through the bake,
I put tinfoil on top

22:42.195 --> 22:43.738
so that they wouldn't
get too hard.

22:43.780 --> 22:44.989
- That's a great trick
to tell us.

22:45.031 --> 22:46.324
- I enjoyed it.
I might have gone

22:46.366 --> 22:48.076
with Frosted Flakes,
but, you know.

22:48.118 --> 22:50.870
- Good note. Good note.

22:51.579 --> 22:55.083
<i>- Well, how cute are they?
- They're adorable.</i>

22:55.125 --> 22:57.168
- We brought a little bit
of soul food to the party.

22:57.210 --> 23:00.588
And today we've made for you
shrimp and grits cream puffs.

23:00.630 --> 23:02.507
- Ooh!
- Wow.

23:02.549 --> 23:04.384
- Shrimp grits, yes.
- Mm-hmm.

23:04.426 --> 23:05.969
- Very good presentation.
- Thank you.

23:06.011 --> 23:08.138
- And I love the flavors.
- Thank you so much.

23:08.179 --> 23:09.597
- Thank you.
- Being a Cajun,

23:09.639 --> 23:11.725
I need a little more kick
to it, but that's just me.

23:11.766 --> 23:12.851
- Okay.
- Yes, yes.

23:12.892 --> 23:15.311
<i>- Ah!
- Oh!</i>

23:15.353 --> 23:16.896
- We have for you sopes.

23:16.938 --> 23:20.025
- Abuelita's sopes.
- Abuelita's recipe.

23:20.066 --> 23:22.193
- Well,
my mouth is just on fire.

23:22.235 --> 23:24.070
- In a good way?
- And I love it.

23:24.112 --> 23:26.156
-
- Oh, man.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.450
<i>- So we made blondies.</i>

23:28.491 --> 23:30.201
<i>- Ooh!</i>

23:30.243 --> 23:33.246
- This could be brunette,
redhead, any color.

23:34.372 --> 23:35.707
- You know what they say.

23:35.749 --> 23:38.877
Blondies do have more fun.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.003
- They do say that.

23:40.045 --> 23:42.756
<i>- Steve and Tom.
- Very festive.</i>

23:42.797 --> 23:46.176
- We made for you today
a shortbread raspberry menorah.

23:46.217 --> 23:49.012
We're Irish Catholics
from Boston,

23:49.054 --> 23:51.139
but my neighbors
across the street

23:51.181 --> 23:52.766
would light their menorah,

23:52.807 --> 23:54.392
and my wife would say,
"You got to come.

23:54.434 --> 23:56.227
They're--they're gonna
light the menorah."

23:56.269 --> 23:58.855
It was really a wonderful
tradition for our family.

23:58.897 --> 24:00.440
And so that's why we've
given this to you.

24:00.482 --> 24:02.901
- And do we eat the glass?
-

24:02.942 --> 24:06.071
- Wait till you taste
the cream.

24:06.112 --> 24:07.947
<i>- The construction
is beautiful.</i>

24:07.989 --> 24:10.158
Your crust is nicely baked.
- Thank you.

24:10.200 --> 24:12.243
- The creativity
is really impressive.

24:12.285 --> 24:14.829
I mean, to come up
with a menorah that's edible?

24:14.871 --> 24:18.416
I don't know why my people
didn't think of this years ago.

24:18.458 --> 24:21.544
We needed the Irish Catholics
to tell us

24:21.586 --> 24:24.255
how to get more food
into a Jewish person.

24:24.297 --> 24:25.298
I'm shocked!

24:26.007 --> 24:27.634
- Jessica and Stephanie.

24:27.676 --> 24:29.678
- Oh!
- Look at them.

24:29.719 --> 24:34.307
<i>- We've made for you
black-bottom pecan pie bites.</i>

24:35.100 --> 24:38.853
- This is the second pecan pie
that I had today.

24:38.895 --> 24:42.273
And I'll tell you,
it's really good.

24:42.315 --> 24:44.567
I like that crust too.
- Thank you.

24:44.609 --> 24:46.945
- You can even look and see
how flaky and buttery it is.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.947
And that's really good.

24:48.988 --> 24:51.116
- I could use a little
more pecans on this one.

24:51.157 --> 24:52.701
But, then, that's me.
- Mm-hmm.

24:52.742 --> 24:54.786
- I'm a pecan person.

24:54.828 --> 24:57.288
This tastes delicious.

24:57.330 --> 24:58.915
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

24:58.957 --> 25:01.001
- Andy, how did you celebrate
growing up?

25:01.042 --> 25:03.294
- Oh, I don't know, you know,
stunts, you know,

25:03.336 --> 25:05.839
roundhouse kicks, front flips,
that kind of stuff.

25:08.508 --> 25:09.968
- Like, the holidays.

25:10.010 --> 25:11.761
How did you celebrate
the holidays?

25:11.803 --> 25:14.139
- Oh, I see.
Yeah, I don't know.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.142
- Bubbe Norma,
which team made you proud

25:17.183 --> 25:19.561
like a grandchild
going to med school?

25:19.602 --> 25:21.146
- And who disappointed you

25:21.187 --> 25:23.273
like a grandson going
into show business?

25:23.314 --> 25:25.984
- One of the teams
executed a vision

25:26.026 --> 25:27.986
that was really extraordinary.

<i>We just really were
overwhelmed by your creativity</i>

25:51.009 --> 25:53.511
and how well
you executed your vision.

25:53.553 --> 25:56.890
- Steve and Tom,
come get your brooch!

25:58.600 --> 26:01.019
- Gentlemen.

26:01.061 --> 26:03.480
With much pride, you guys.
- Thank you, Bubbe.

26:03.521 --> 26:05.023
- Whoo!
- We're super excited.

26:05.065 --> 26:06.483
- We're happy about that.
- We're really excited.

26:06.524 --> 26:07.984
- Never thought that
would happen.

26:08.026 --> 26:10.070
- Good job, guys.
- Congratulations.

26:10.111 --> 26:11.237
- I'm an old man.
I didn't think I could

26:11.279 --> 26:12.739
win anything anymore.

26:16.409 --> 26:18.661
- Bakers, we got a taste
of your holiday traditions.

26:18.703 --> 26:21.164
But now we want to learn
something surprising about you.

26:21.206 --> 26:23.458
- In today's
Pie in the Sky challenge,

26:23.500 --> 26:26.252
we're asking you
to perform a miracle.

26:26.294 --> 26:28.129
<i>- We want the outside
to represent one teammate</i>

26:28.171 --> 26:29.547
<i>and the inside of your bake</i>

26:29.589 --> 26:31.132
<i>to reveal something
about the other.</i>

26:31.174 --> 26:32.759
- Yeah, I want a cake
that makes me go,

26:32.801 --> 26:34.594
"H-what?"
- Mm.

26:34.636 --> 26:36.596
- And then, "Mmm!"

26:36.638 --> 26:38.264
- So...

26:39.432 --> 26:40.600
Let's get bakin'!

26:42.936 --> 26:45.063
- Again, great catchphrase.

26:45.105 --> 26:46.773
- Right?
- Unbelievable.

26:46.815 --> 26:48.233
- Money well spent.

26:48.274 --> 26:50.068
- One, two, three,
four, five, six.

26:50.110 --> 26:51.736
- We have to do
the carrot cake, right?

26:51.778 --> 26:53.530
- The carrot cake?
- Yes.

26:53.571 --> 26:55.073
- Don't forget
to drain those cherries.

26:55.115 --> 26:56.491
- Nope.
I'm on it right now.

26:56.533 --> 26:57.617
- Cool.

26:57.659 --> 27:00.203
- I'll start
with the syrup first.

27:00.787 --> 27:01.996
- Hello, you guys.
- Hello.

27:02.038 --> 27:04.082
- Hi.
- Is this a good time?

27:04.124 --> 27:05.500
- Oh, yes, this is
absolutely a great time.

27:05.542 --> 27:06.876
- Everything is
totally organized.

27:07.961 --> 27:09.421
- What are you making?

27:09.462 --> 27:12.257
- We are making
a seven-spiced reveal cake.

27:12.298 --> 27:13.800
- Uh-huh.
- Ooh.

27:13.842 --> 27:15.844
- Half my family goes
to the movies on Christmas.

27:15.885 --> 27:18.680
And so I'm packing the cake
with all the candies

27:18.722 --> 27:20.724
that I would bring
to the movies on Christmas.

27:20.765 --> 27:23.893
- So what does the outside
of the cake represent?

27:23.935 --> 27:25.311
- So the sponge

27:25.353 --> 27:27.814
<i>is incorporating
seven spices,</i>

27:27.856 --> 27:30.442
<i>so it's reflecting my family.</i>

27:30.483 --> 27:32.110
<i>I'm the youngest
of seven kids.</i>

27:32.152 --> 27:34.612
- Wow.
- So we have a collection

27:34.654 --> 27:36.448
of allspice.

27:36.489 --> 27:39.993
We have cinnamon.
We have cloves. We have ginger.

27:40.035 --> 27:42.037
Lot of redheads
in the family, so...

27:44.664 --> 27:46.291
- Sorry, they're doing
some demo over there.

27:46.332 --> 27:48.335
- You know, the scene stealers.
- Yeah.

27:48.376 --> 27:50.670
- Keep it down over there!
- The hell is going on?

27:50.712 --> 27:52.756
- I'm working here!

27:52.797 --> 27:55.425
- Attention hog right here.
- Let the grandmas back in!

27:55.467 --> 27:57.552
- Trying to get
some heartwarming quips!

27:58.845 --> 28:00.555
Sorry about that.

28:00.597 --> 28:02.140
Every time we walk out
on that floor,

28:02.182 --> 28:03.683
it's, like, chaos.

28:03.725 --> 28:05.935
- Chaos City, USA.

28:05.977 --> 28:07.979
- What state is that in?
- Uh...

28:08.021 --> 28:10.065
it's in the state of--

28:10.106 --> 28:12.400
- Emergency.

28:50.563 --> 28:52.524
- We are making
a strawberry cake.

28:52.565 --> 28:54.150
- Strawberry cake?
- Wow.

28:54.192 --> 28:55.902
- With white chocolate
buttercream.

28:55.944 --> 28:58.113

- What are you guys making?

28:58.154 --> 29:00.865
- We're making a traditional
Black Forest cake.

29:00.907 --> 29:02.075
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

29:02.117 --> 29:03.743
- Yeah.
- Black Forest cake?

29:05.745 --> 29:07.247
- You almost done
with your batter?

29:07.288 --> 29:08.707
- Gettin' close.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.376
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

29:11.418 --> 29:12.585
- Hi, how are you?
- How you doing?

29:12.627 --> 29:13.878
- Good.
- Good, how are y'all doing?

29:13.920 --> 29:16.172
- What are you making?
- So I grew up in Germany

29:16.214 --> 29:17.632
up until about ten

29:17.674 --> 29:20.176
in a region just outside
the Black Forest,

29:20.218 --> 29:21.636
so we're doing
a Black Forest cake.

29:21.678 --> 29:22.846
<i>- Okay.
- We're also gonna incorporate</i>

29:22.887 --> 29:24.097
<i>some of
my grandmother's cookies.</i>

29:24.139 --> 29:25.223
<i>So when
I was growing up,</i>

29:25.265 --> 29:26.474
<i>my mom
and grandmother made</i>

29:26.516 --> 29:27.892
sometimes thousands
of cookies for Christmas.

29:27.934 --> 29:30.270
- Oh, my goodness.
- For me, Christmas is about

29:30.311 --> 29:34.733
family and getting together
and just having a good time.

29:34.774 --> 29:36.609
- What are you guys making?
- So the outside of the cake

29:36.651 --> 29:37.986
is Joelle.
- Yes.

29:38.028 --> 29:39.154
<i>- The outside of the cake</i>

29:39.195 --> 29:41.031
<i>is a winter wonderland
Christmas theme.</i>

29:41.072 --> 29:42.407
<i>- I love a white Christmas.
- A white Christmas.</i>

29:42.449 --> 29:43.950
<i>- Okay.
- The inside is me.</i>

29:43.992 --> 29:46.995
The inside is a beach theme.
So we have a strawberry cake.

29:47.037 --> 29:48.329
<i>- Mmm.
- We have some graham cracker</i>

29:48.371 --> 29:50.248
that's gonna be sand.

29:50.290 --> 29:52.876
We have some candied fish...
- Mm-hmm.

29:52.917 --> 29:54.252
- And blue sprinkles
for the ocean.

29:54.294 --> 29:55.420
- Wow.
- Beautiful.

29:55.462 --> 29:57.255
- Baking during the holidays

29:57.297 --> 29:59.174
definitely brings folks together.

29:59.215 --> 30:00.550
- Mm-hmm.
- I think people just

30:00.592 --> 30:02.594
<i>look forward to that time
and the joy</i>

30:02.635 --> 30:04.429
<i>that they see
on each other's faces</i>

30:04.471 --> 30:05.930
when they open that tin
or that box...

30:05.972 --> 30:07.682
- Oh, yeah, for sure.
- Of goodies.

30:07.724 --> 30:09.768
- These are gonna be
little peppermint bark

30:09.809 --> 30:11.770
<i>snowmen macarons
to live inside</i>

30:11.811 --> 30:14.230
a little
gingerbread chocolate house.

30:14.272 --> 30:15.774
- Yeah.
- S'mores bark house.

30:15.815 --> 30:18.193
- Okay.
- I think that the phrase

30:18.234 --> 30:20.362
"If you bake it,
they will come"

30:20.403 --> 30:24.574
is such a true,
authentic statement.

30:24.616 --> 30:25.742
- So that's what I need to do

30:25.784 --> 30:26.868
when my kids
want to make s'mores...

30:26.910 --> 30:27.952
- Yeah!
- Just roast 'em like that?

30:27.994 --> 30:29.204
- Oh, my gosh.
Or you can put 'em

30:29.245 --> 30:30.538
in the oven under the broiler.

30:30.580 --> 30:32.248
- But that looks way more fun.

30:32.290 --> 30:33.917
- Oh, yeah, it's so fun.

30:33.958 --> 30:37.629
- I always say the last
ingredient is always love.

30:37.671 --> 30:39.214
- Absolutely.
- 'Cause I think

30:39.255 --> 30:42.008
that it's just special
when it's baked with love.

30:42.967 --> 30:46.012
- Let me look at my cakes.
- They're getting close.

30:47.180 --> 30:49.391
- How did it feel
to win the first challenge?

30:49.432 --> 30:50.475
- Oh, you know,
it was pretty fun.

30:50.517 --> 30:51.851
- It was really fun.
- Unexpected.

30:51.893 --> 30:53.311
- There was a lot
of good stuff.

30:53.353 --> 30:54.646
- There was.
- Oh, my God.

30:54.688 --> 30:56.773
What are you guys making today?
- This is called

30:56.815 --> 30:58.358
the Blackout Cake.
- Ooh.

30:58.400 --> 31:00.318
- So it's basically
all chocolate.

31:00.360 --> 31:03.071
- Oh, my.
- This cake has buttercream,

31:03.113 --> 31:06.741
<i>ganache, chocolate cake,
and peppermint.</i>

31:06.783 --> 31:08.702
<i>So you cut into it...
- Okay.</i>

31:08.743 --> 31:11.746
<i>- And the tube will be filled
with candy canes.</i>

31:11.788 --> 31:13.540
- Oh, come on.
- And then the meringue goes

31:13.581 --> 31:17.168
around the candy cane tube
and it oozes all out.

31:17.210 --> 31:20.672
- Big T's favorite candy
is a Peppermint Patty.

31:20.714 --> 31:22.340
- Mm-hmm.
- Did you say Big T?

31:22.382 --> 31:23.675
- I also like them.
- Big T, yeah.

31:23.717 --> 31:25.218
- Papa Tom.
- He doesn't call me Dad.

31:25.260 --> 31:27.178
He calls me everything but.

31:27.220 --> 31:29.180
- Big T.
- Calls me Tommy, Timmy.

31:29.222 --> 31:31.182
- Zapato.
Zapato's a good one.

31:31.224 --> 31:32.559
- Zapato!
- Zapato!

31:32.600 --> 31:33.893
- Just a little something.
- Well, we're definitely

31:33.935 --> 31:35.228
calling you Zapato
moving forward.

31:35.270 --> 31:36.813
- Oh, Za-papa.
- If that's all right with you.

31:36.855 --> 31:38.064
- It is written.
- Yeah.

31:38.106 --> 31:40.191
- So who's the outside
and who's the inside?

31:40.233 --> 31:41.860
- The outside is my dad

31:41.901 --> 31:43.445
because he holds
the whole thing together.

31:43.486 --> 31:44.529
- Okay.
- He's like--

31:44.571 --> 31:46.531
he's the big bear hug.
- Uh-huh.

31:46.573 --> 31:47.907
- And then the--
- Good ole Big T.

31:47.949 --> 31:49.617
- And then the inside
of this specific cake is me

31:49.659 --> 31:53.246
because I'm a surprise.

31:53.288 --> 31:54.622
- He is.
- Are you a surprise?

31:54.664 --> 31:55.665
- Yeah, I'm a little spicy,
right?

31:55.707 --> 31:56.958
- Zany.
- A little zany.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.084
- I thought you meant,
like, an unexpected baby.

31:58.126 --> 32:00.086
- That's what I meant.
- He was...

32:00.128 --> 32:01.629
- I was a--
- Kind of a surprise.

32:01.671 --> 32:03.715
- Sometimes the stork
just flies on over

32:03.757 --> 32:05.216
and drops it down the chimney,
am I right?

32:05.258 --> 32:06.801
- Unreal.

32:08.219 --> 32:11.056
- These are the dough balls
that we are going to fry.

32:12.223 --> 32:13.558
- What are you guys making?

32:13.600 --> 32:15.935
- We're making
my favorite dessert.

32:15.977 --> 32:17.812
- Oh.
- It's gulab jamun.

32:17.854 --> 32:19.105
- It's a gulab jamun.
- Ooh.

32:19.147 --> 32:21.566
- And those are
traditional Indian desserts

32:21.608 --> 32:23.068
which are served normally

32:23.109 --> 32:25.820
in Indian weddings,
gatherings, restaurants.

32:25.862 --> 32:28.531
Those are, like, dough balls
dipped in sugar syrup

32:28.573 --> 32:29.949
with rose, cardamom.

32:29.991 --> 32:32.660
- Yep, and then
we are having a mold outside

32:32.702 --> 32:34.412
<i>which is rose-shaped.</i>

32:34.454 --> 32:35.789
<i>- And made of white chocolate.</i>

32:35.830 --> 32:37.415
<i>- That sounds beautiful.</i>

32:37.457 --> 32:38.667
- Since it's
her favorite dessert

32:38.708 --> 32:40.377
when she was growing up,

32:40.418 --> 32:41.961
you know,
her idea of a piñata cake,

32:42.003 --> 32:44.756
instead of candies,
she wanted, like, gulab jamun

32:44.798 --> 32:45.924
spilling out of it.
- Yeah.

32:45.965 --> 32:47.008
- When you--

32:47.050 --> 32:48.843
- When you hammer it.
- Aw.

32:48.885 --> 32:50.595
- So that's the whole idea.
- That's awesome.

32:50.637 --> 32:52.972
- It's actually
my mom's recipe.

32:53.014 --> 32:55.934
So my mom taught me
how to make gulab jamuns.

32:55.975 --> 32:58.895
Growing up,
we had so many things

32:58.937 --> 33:00.730
<i>that my mom used to make.</i>

33:00.772 --> 33:02.148
<i>She loves to bake.</i>

33:02.190 --> 33:05.485
She has a lot of innovative
ideas always in her mind.

33:05.527 --> 33:08.154
When I came here ten years ago,

33:08.196 --> 33:12.200
I really missed her
and her baking.

33:12.242 --> 33:15.453
And that's why I thought
that we should bake this

33:15.495 --> 33:16.955
as our reveal bake.

33:16.996 --> 33:19.207
If I fail in this--
I hope not.

33:19.249 --> 33:20.792
- You won't.
- There's no failing here.

33:20.834 --> 33:22.043
- Okay.
- Yeah.

33:22.085 --> 33:24.504
- Only winning
and sort of winning less.

33:24.546 --> 33:27.007
- Okay.

33:27.841 --> 33:29.592
- When do we get
to play air drums on the show?

33:29.634 --> 33:30.719
- Right now.

33:34.347 --> 33:36.599
Did we get that?
Is it in the can?

33:46.109 --> 33:48.945
- I can't imagine
what we're gonna see.

33:48.987 --> 33:51.406
- This is heaven right here.
I died and went to heaven...

33:51.448 --> 33:53.491
on this blanket.

33:53.533 --> 33:55.827
- I love to rock.
- I do too.

33:55.869 --> 33:56.995
- What they talking about?
- I have no idea

33:57.037 --> 33:58.455
what they're talking about.

a holiday miracle
with a sweet reveal.

34:19.851 --> 34:22.354
<i>The inside's got
to represent one partner.</i>

34:22.395 --> 34:24.773
- We have graham crackers
that are gonna look like sand.

34:24.814 --> 34:26.608
And we have some fishy gummies.

34:26.649 --> 34:28.985
So it's gonna be
a beach party inside.

34:29.027 --> 34:31.863
- And the outside
represents the other.

34:31.905 --> 34:34.240
- On the outside,
we're gonna decorate it

34:34.282 --> 34:36.618
with my passion,
which is music.

34:36.659 --> 34:39.454
- I mean, the time constraints
on something this large--

34:39.496 --> 34:42.916
- I'm looking, some--
some are cool as a cucumber.

34:42.957 --> 34:44.584
- This is where
the magic begins, baby.

34:44.626 --> 34:46.211
- But they're not all
like that.

34:46.252 --> 34:48.004
- Please work.

34:48.046 --> 34:49.923
What in the world
is going on with these?

34:49.964 --> 34:52.050
Why are some of them
getting so dark?

34:52.092 --> 34:53.927
I'm having a hard time.

34:53.968 --> 34:55.887
- What could go wrong, Norma,
you think?

34:55.929 --> 34:57.222
- A lot of things
could go wrong.

34:57.263 --> 34:58.932
<i>First of all,
when you're making something</i>

34:58.973 --> 35:02.185
this intricate,
it's the execution here

35:02.227 --> 35:03.728
<i>that's gonna
make a difference.</i>

35:03.770 --> 35:05.146
- Yeah.
- But sometimes

35:05.188 --> 35:06.481
just because it's pretty
on the outside,

35:06.523 --> 35:08.191
<i>it's not all good
on the inside.</i>

35:08.233 --> 35:10.110
- Yeah, can't judge a book
by its cover.

35:11.569 --> 35:13.321
- Oh, Norma, you know you
real picky about your cakes.

35:13.363 --> 35:15.949
- I admit it, guys.
I am picky about cakes.

35:15.990 --> 35:18.451
- And Anne hasn't met a pie
or a cake

35:18.493 --> 35:19.661
that she doesn't like.

35:21.913 --> 35:24.416
- Cesar, these look
like candy canes, right?

35:24.457 --> 35:26.626
- Best ones yet, yeah.
- Okay, good.

35:26.668 --> 35:28.003
- What are you guys making?

35:28.044 --> 35:29.796
- So we're gonna do a bucket

35:29.838 --> 35:31.131
<i>of popcorn on the outside,</i>

35:31.172 --> 35:32.757
<i>but it's carrot cake.</i>

35:32.799 --> 35:35.093
<i>And then we're gonna decorate
it with some candy canes.</i>

35:35.135 --> 35:37.804
- Ah, I love that.
- If it goes according to plan.

35:37.846 --> 35:39.973
- Who's the popcorn?
Who's the carrot cake?

35:40.015 --> 35:41.766
- Who's the carrot?
- Carrot cake's me.

35:41.808 --> 35:43.935
I love carrot cake.
Popcorn is her.

35:43.977 --> 35:46.062
- Why popcorn, Reggie?

35:46.104 --> 35:48.732
- I can crush a Costco-size bag
of popcorn in two days.

35:48.773 --> 35:50.608
- Yeah.
- Love it.

35:50.650 --> 35:51.693
- I think
that went really well.

35:51.735 --> 35:53.069
- I do too.
- Should we talk--

35:53.111 --> 35:54.362
should we talk about how
that went while we're still

35:54.404 --> 35:55.488
standing here,
or should we walk away?

35:55.530 --> 35:57.073
- No, I think we should
stay right here.

35:57.115 --> 35:58.324
- Okay.
- How do you think that went?

35:58.366 --> 35:59.909
- It was great.
They're so nice.

35:59.951 --> 36:01.911
- They are so nice.
And I think they like us.

36:01.953 --> 36:03.788
- I love you guys.
- I also don't find

36:03.830 --> 36:05.790
that we were distracting
to them at all.

36:05.832 --> 36:07.250
Like, they were able
to keep baking.

36:07.292 --> 36:08.335
- Absolutely.

36:08.376 --> 36:10.170
- I'm not distracted
at all right now.

36:11.296 --> 36:13.381
- We're gonna get
real cute here.

36:13.423 --> 36:15.050
- This is the fun part.
This is the fun part.

36:15.091 --> 36:16.801
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

36:16.843 --> 36:17.927
- What are you making?

36:17.969 --> 36:19.637
- We are making
a four-layer cake.

36:19.679 --> 36:22.807
<i>The outside's gonna be me.
I love music.</i>

36:22.849 --> 36:24.809
<i>I play a lot of instruments
and stuff like that.</i>

36:24.851 --> 36:26.936
<i>So that's one of my passions.</i>

36:26.978 --> 36:28.772
The inside is gonna
represent Shawn.

36:28.813 --> 36:32.275
- So the inside represents me.
And I'm a big sports buff.

36:32.317 --> 36:34.486
And recently,
I took up the sport of golf.

36:34.527 --> 36:36.613
You take out a golf club,
it's all you.

36:36.654 --> 36:38.031
You're in the zone.

36:38.073 --> 36:40.784
You're really playing
against yourself.

36:40.825 --> 36:41.951
It's awesome.
It's a great game.

36:41.993 --> 36:43.119
- Which means it's not a sport.

36:43.161 --> 36:44.537
-
- Oh.

36:44.579 --> 36:45.705
- We're best friends.

36:45.747 --> 36:47.207
We've known each other
since sixth grade.

36:47.248 --> 36:51.127
So we pretty much like
all the same stuff.

36:51.169 --> 36:54.547
But Shawn, in his later years,
he's become,

36:54.589 --> 36:59.678
you know, obsessed
with this game called golf

36:59.719 --> 37:03.056
that I absolutely can't stand.

37:03.098 --> 37:04.974
- So when we bust open this...

37:05.016 --> 37:06.434
- Yes.
- Cake...

37:06.476 --> 37:08.186
- Mm-hmm.
- What's gonna be inside?

37:08.228 --> 37:09.145
- We can't tell you
what's in the middle,

37:09.187 --> 37:10.855
but a four-layer cake.

37:10.897 --> 37:12.315
- You can tell us.
- You can tell us.

37:12.357 --> 37:14.025
- Uh-uh.
- Lies, it's all lies.

37:14.067 --> 37:15.735
- You can't tell them.
- Right.

37:15.777 --> 37:18.446
- So, Norma, what would your
advice be to an 18-year-old?

37:18.488 --> 37:20.990
- To my 18-year-old self?
- Self, yeah.

37:21.032 --> 37:23.118
- Probably get a boob job.

37:23.159 --> 37:24.869
-
- I would give that same advice

37:24.911 --> 37:26.830
to my 50-year-old self, okay?

37:31.126 --> 37:32.877
- 30 minutes, bakers.

37:32.919 --> 37:34.546
- Ugh!
This part takes forever.

37:36.047 --> 37:37.757
- Look how ugly this looks.
-

37:37.799 --> 37:39.551
- I pray this cake works.

37:39.592 --> 37:41.052
- Are they overcooked?

37:41.094 --> 37:42.971
- I overcooked it.
It's okay.

37:43.013 --> 37:45.348
Nothing a little frosting
can't fix.

37:45.390 --> 37:47.892
- Am I gonna be the only one
that's gonna have a drink?

37:48.893 --> 37:51.521
- Ten minutes!
- Ah!

37:51.563 --> 37:52.564
- What's going on?

37:52.605 --> 37:54.065
- I don't know
if this is helpful,

37:54.107 --> 37:55.608
but the energy in here
is really stressing me out.

37:57.485 --> 37:58.653
Does that help?

37:58.695 --> 38:00.655
- Chocolate's just too cold.

38:00.697 --> 38:02.615
All of a sudden, this doesn't
want to go together.

38:02.657 --> 38:04.743
- I'm really stressed.

38:04.784 --> 38:08.288
This is definitely not the cake
that I envisioned in my head.

38:08.329 --> 38:12.125
The chocolate collar
is looking a little bit messy.

38:12.167 --> 38:13.710
- Still came out too short?

38:13.752 --> 38:16.963
<i>- It didn't fully reach
the whole length of the cake.</i>

38:17.005 --> 38:19.382
The red stripes
melted together.

38:19.424 --> 38:21.468
It is a hot mess.
- Take this collar off.

38:21.509 --> 38:22.927
- Are you sure?
I'm scared.

38:22.969 --> 38:24.262
- We're trying
to recover right now.

38:24.304 --> 38:26.973
- But the timer is going down.
I am panicking.

38:27.015 --> 38:28.141
- Any frosting.

38:28.183 --> 38:29.184
- I don't know if that's
gonna fix it.

38:29.225 --> 38:31.394
<i>- It is what it is.</i>

38:31.436 --> 38:32.812
We're gonna do our best
to make sure that this cake

38:32.854 --> 38:35.065
looks the best it can.

38:35.106 --> 38:37.442
- Do that,
maybe I can put M&M'S.

38:37.484 --> 38:40.528
- Give me extra olives.
I like it really dirty.

38:41.529 --> 38:42.697
- It's almost time!

38:43.990 --> 38:46.076
- I feel like we're in surgery.

38:46.117 --> 38:47.702
- That's beautiful.

38:47.744 --> 38:49.120
- Ooh, they got 20 seconds.

38:49.162 --> 38:51.414
- We got to go.
We got to go.

38:51.456 --> 38:57.420
Five, four, three, two, one.

38:57.462 --> 38:58.880
- Time's up!

38:58.922 --> 39:01.800
- Everybody!

39:01.841 --> 39:03.551
- Whoo-hoo!

39:04.969 --> 39:06.680
- It's real good.

39:08.431 --> 39:09.933
- Oh, gosh, that looks good.

39:09.974 --> 39:11.768
- Oh, my God.
- Look at that.

39:11.810 --> 39:13.019
- Oh, wow, look at that.

39:15.939 --> 39:23.071
<i>♪ ♪</i>

39:27.450 --> 39:30.245
- Tom and Steve, come on up.

39:30.286 --> 39:33.039
- Here we go.
- Oh, wow.

39:33.081 --> 39:34.374
- We call this
the Blackout Cake.

39:34.416 --> 39:36.001
So it's a lot of chocolate.

39:37.669 --> 39:40.255
- Isn't this exciting, knowing
there's some surprise in there?

39:40.296 --> 39:42.340
- It is.
- Yes!

39:42.382 --> 39:43.842
- Now, that's the size of slice
I would take.

39:43.883 --> 39:46.052
- Mamma mia!
- Ay-yi-yi-yi.

39:46.094 --> 39:47.345
<i>- Wow.</i>

39:47.387 --> 39:49.347
<i>- The presentation
is beautiful.</i>

39:49.389 --> 39:50.724
<i>- The peppermint flavor</i>

39:50.765 --> 39:53.018
balances beautifully
with the chocolate.

39:53.059 --> 39:55.061
The only thing I have to say

39:55.103 --> 39:57.689
is, your layers
are not uniform.

39:57.731 --> 39:59.357
They're a little bit askew.

39:59.399 --> 40:00.984
- I don't care
if those layers aren't--

40:03.528 --> 40:05.572
I mean, it just tastes awesome.

40:05.613 --> 40:06.948
- I'm with you, Anne.
I don't care.

40:06.990 --> 40:08.199
It's a winner.

40:11.870 --> 40:13.663
- Wow.
- Look at that.

40:13.705 --> 40:16.374
<i>- Beautiful.
- We made a piñata cake.</i>

40:16.416 --> 40:18.376
<i>- So the outside here
represents</i>

40:18.418 --> 40:20.170
this wonderful lady by my side.

40:20.211 --> 40:23.089
It's a white chocolate rose,
and she represents

40:23.131 --> 40:24.424
a rose in my life,
fresh, dainty,

40:24.466 --> 40:27.093
fragrant,
full of ideas, creative.

40:27.135 --> 40:29.512
- Brownie points.

40:29.554 --> 40:32.182
- So instead of cutting,
we'll smash this pinata.

40:32.223 --> 40:33.475
- Oh, you gonna smash it.

40:33.516 --> 40:35.685
Okay.
- What a shame.

40:35.727 --> 40:38.605
- I have to say,
the cake is beautiful.

40:38.646 --> 40:40.273
- Oh, thank you.
- I can't believe

40:40.315 --> 40:41.483
you're gonna destroy it.
- Break it.

40:41.524 --> 40:42.359
- I know.

40:42.400 --> 40:44.778
- Smash it, smash it.

40:44.819 --> 40:45.737
- Smash the rose!

40:47.655 --> 40:48.448
- Okay.

40:48.490 --> 40:51.034
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

40:51.076 --> 40:54.704
- Inside is a gulab jamun cake,
my favorite dessert.

40:54.746 --> 40:58.708
- Infused in a syrup
of cardamom, saffron, and rose.

40:58.750 --> 41:00.043
- Oh, God.
- Mmm.

41:00.085 --> 41:01.336
Isn't that--

41:01.378 --> 41:03.755
<i>- The creativity
is impressive.</i>

41:03.797 --> 41:05.757
You thought out of the box.
It's great.

41:05.799 --> 41:06.966
- Thank you.

41:07.008 --> 41:08.259
- It's festive.
That's important.

41:08.301 --> 41:10.553
- It is very festive.
- The cake, it's moist.

41:10.595 --> 41:12.972
Sometimes it can be
overpowering using rosewater,

41:13.014 --> 41:14.432
but you did it just right.

41:14.474 --> 41:15.809
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

41:15.850 --> 41:17.227
- Reggie and Cesar.

41:17.268 --> 41:19.729
- Oh, my.
- Uh-oh.

41:19.771 --> 41:22.273
- Tell us how you feel
about your creation.

41:23.441 --> 41:24.401
- Well--
- It was tough.

41:24.442 --> 41:26.194
- It was tough,
but we have

41:26.236 --> 41:29.197
a beautiful bucket of popcorn.

41:29.239 --> 41:31.866
- It looks like you didn't have
time to smooth out the outside

41:31.908 --> 41:34.619
<i>and get the stripes
quite straight.</i>

41:34.661 --> 41:36.996
- I'm really hoping the cake
inside will kind of redeem it.

41:37.038 --> 41:38.581
- Yeah.

41:38.623 --> 41:40.083
- We're holding our breath
for y'all.

41:40.125 --> 41:42.419
You realize that, right?
- I know.

41:42.460 --> 41:44.879
- Ooh!
- Oh, oh!

41:44.921 --> 41:46.089
- Whoa.

41:46.131 --> 41:47.841
- The first time
I celebrated my birthday,

41:47.882 --> 41:48.883
it was a carrot cake.

41:48.925 --> 41:50.635
It's my personal favorite.

41:50.677 --> 41:54.305
- So we have a brown butter
cream cheese frosting

41:54.347 --> 41:56.433
and then a filling
of liquid cheesecake.

41:56.474 --> 41:59.269
- Oh, my goodness.
- Liquid cheesecake.

41:59.310 --> 42:02.022
- It's delicious.
- The salty popcorn

42:02.063 --> 42:03.940
with the sweet, I love that.

42:03.982 --> 42:06.776
- The cake is so moist.
- The cake's very tasty.

42:06.818 --> 42:09.112
- Really, really moist.
- The flavor is there.

42:09.154 --> 42:10.488
- Yeah.

42:10.530 --> 42:12.991
<i>- Oh, wow, look at that.</i>

42:13.033 --> 42:15.410
<i>- Today we've made for you
a strawberry cake</i>

42:15.452 --> 42:17.162
with white chocolate frosting.

42:17.203 --> 42:19.414
- The cake
is absolutely beautiful.

42:19.456 --> 42:22.834
I love the intricate detail,
and it screams holiday.

42:24.252 --> 42:26.171
Can't wait to see
what comes out.

42:27.839 --> 42:30.091
- Whoa!

42:30.133 --> 42:31.926
- Oh, my goodness.
That color.

42:31.968 --> 42:34.220
That is just beautiful.

42:34.262 --> 42:36.431
- Cake is very flavorful.
- Thank you.

42:39.309 --> 42:41.311
<i>- Look. How cute is that?
- Wow.</i>

42:41.353 --> 42:42.854
- That's Christmas right there.

42:42.896 --> 42:45.440
- We have made
milk chocolate houses

42:45.482 --> 42:48.651
with a homemade graham cracker
and marshmallow.

42:48.693 --> 42:50.820
- The structure of the house
is done just beautifully.

42:50.862 --> 42:53.782
- What you did with chocolate,
that's remarkable.

42:53.823 --> 42:55.992
- So here goes.

42:56.034 --> 42:57.035
- Another hammer.

42:57.077 --> 42:58.036
- Wow.
- Yes!

42:58.078 --> 42:59.496
-
- Oh, wow!

42:59.537 --> 43:01.498
How darling is that?

43:01.539 --> 43:03.166
- Wow.
- And so then the inside,

43:03.208 --> 43:05.126
we have these little

43:05.168 --> 43:07.879
peppermint bark
snowman macarons.

43:07.921 --> 43:09.881
- Too cute, too cute.
- It's adorable. Really cute.

43:09.923 --> 43:11.508
- Oh, he's a sweetheart.

43:11.549 --> 43:13.176
- Macarons are
the hardest cookie to make,

43:13.218 --> 43:15.345
and for some reason,
my brain goes,

43:15.387 --> 43:17.305
"Oh, yeah, you should do that."

43:17.347 --> 43:19.057
- Oh, I must tell you,
this is delicious.

43:19.099 --> 43:20.141
- Oh, thank you.

43:20.183 --> 43:22.477
- The peppermint
really comes out.

43:22.519 --> 43:24.729
- The execution,
the presentation,

43:24.771 --> 43:26.940
and the taste,
they're all a hit.

43:29.943 --> 43:31.778
- Oh, wow.
- Wow.

43:31.820 --> 43:32.987
- My goodness.

43:33.029 --> 43:35.198
<i>- Wow, a real showstopper.</i>

43:35.240 --> 43:38.910
- We made a cake that
represents me on the outside.

43:38.952 --> 43:42.330
I love pink and glitter
and Christmas and sprinkles.

43:42.372 --> 43:44.374
- It screams holiday.

43:44.416 --> 43:45.875
- Oh, good.
- Yes.

43:45.917 --> 43:47.836
<i>- The Christmas tree,
the detail, the piping...</i>

43:47.877 --> 43:49.337
- Absolutely beautiful.
- It's beautiful.

43:49.379 --> 43:53.216
- Aw, what a shame
to even cut into it.

43:53.258 --> 43:54.884
- Wow.
- Whoa!

43:54.926 --> 43:57.387
- It is a Black Forest cake.
- Mm.

43:57.429 --> 44:00.348
- The cake is very moist.
- Thank you.

44:00.390 --> 44:03.476
- And flavorful.
- You nailed it.

44:03.518 --> 44:05.103
- You perfected that.
That's really good.

44:05.145 --> 44:06.563
- Can you eat these things?

44:06.604 --> 44:09.190
- Yeah, they're just candies,
but yeah.

44:09.232 --> 44:11.109
- Don't break a tooth.
- I don't wanna break a tooth.

44:11.151 --> 44:12.027
My God.
- Don't break a tooth,

44:12.068 --> 44:13.695
whatever you do.

44:13.737 --> 44:15.739
- I'll take your word for it.

44:15.780 --> 44:17.073
- Anne, how many
did you have in your mouth?

44:17.115 --> 44:19.325
- A big--

44:19.367 --> 44:21.911
I don't do things half-ass,
okay?

44:23.288 --> 44:24.998
- Gerard and Shawn.

44:25.040 --> 44:26.624
- Look at that.

44:26.666 --> 44:28.585
<i>- Music means a lot to me.
It's kind of like cooking.</i>

44:28.626 --> 44:30.587
It brings people together.

44:30.628 --> 44:33.089
- So the inside is my surprise.

44:33.131 --> 44:35.425
- Here we go.

44:35.467 --> 44:38.345
- Oh!
- Oh, there it is.

44:38.386 --> 44:40.597
- It represents my love of golf

44:40.638 --> 44:42.682
<i>with white chocolate
golf balls.</i>

44:42.724 --> 44:45.101
- Oh, is that adorable?

44:45.143 --> 44:47.979
Thought that the surprise
came out beautifully.

44:48.021 --> 44:50.899
- The cake itself is a vanilla
cake with a lemony flavor.

44:50.940 --> 44:53.943
I made a few pralines for you
with some strawberries.

44:53.985 --> 44:56.029
- That touch
of lemon is so good.

44:56.071 --> 44:57.739
- This is absolutely delicious.
- Yes.

44:57.781 --> 45:00.283
- Thank you.
- I love the roasted pecans.

45:00.325 --> 45:01.368
- Thank you.
- So thank you.

45:03.453 --> 45:05.372
<i>- Adorable.
- It's a beautiful cake.</i>

45:05.413 --> 45:06.790
<i>It's holiday all the way.</i>

45:06.831 --> 45:11.461
- So what we have for you
is a seven-spiced sponge.

45:11.503 --> 45:14.214
- Okay.
- Wha!

45:14.255 --> 45:15.632
That's a good reveal.

45:15.674 --> 45:17.133
- Yes, I like the way
the candy dripped down.

45:17.175 --> 45:18.635
<i>- It just kind of fell out,
yeah.</i>

45:18.677 --> 45:20.595
<i>- This represents the candy
that my family</i>

45:20.637 --> 45:22.597
sneaks into the movies
every Christmas.

45:22.639 --> 45:25.392
And I don't know about you,
but I'm not paying $6

45:25.433 --> 45:29.062
for a box of candy that I can
get down the street for $2.

45:29.104 --> 45:31.356
- Yeah!

45:31.398 --> 45:33.983
- The cake is a little bit dry.

45:34.025 --> 45:36.361
It could have probably
baked a bit less.

45:36.403 --> 45:38.321
- Okay.
- The layers of the cake,

45:38.363 --> 45:40.573
you didn't put any icing
in between?

45:40.615 --> 45:42.492
- No, I didn't want
to add more sugar.

45:42.534 --> 45:44.035
- But I'm a sweet tooth,
so you see,

45:44.077 --> 45:44.953
I would have liked icing.

45:44.994 --> 45:46.955
- Yeah.
- I wish I could say

45:46.996 --> 45:49.165
I loved it, but I didn't.

45:49.207 --> 45:52.377
Guess I'm just not crazy
about a lot of the spices.

45:53.628 --> 45:55.463
- As much as this show
is warm and fuzzy

45:55.505 --> 45:56.673
and about the holidays,

45:56.715 --> 45:58.466
we do have
to send someone home.

45:58.508 --> 45:59.467
- When I think
about the holidays,

45:59.509 --> 46:01.636
I don't think about competition

46:01.678 --> 46:03.596
and sending people home.

46:03.638 --> 46:05.015
- When I think
about some holidays,

46:05.056 --> 46:06.683
I do think
about sending people home.

46:06.725 --> 46:08.685
- That's a good point.
- Back to their homes.

46:08.727 --> 46:10.729
- Correct, yeah.
- From my home.

46:19.195 --> 46:20.447
- I am really glad
we're not judges.

46:20.488 --> 46:21.656
- Truly.

46:21.698 --> 46:23.992
Because we hate conflict.
- Yeah.

46:24.034 --> 46:25.869
- And also, all the bakers
are so nice,

46:25.910 --> 46:27.078
having to send any of them
home would be horrible.

46:27.120 --> 46:29.539
- Yeah.
- But our grannies,

46:29.581 --> 46:31.541
they've got their work
cut out for them.

46:33.460 --> 46:38.340
So, grannies, have you decided
who you love the most?

46:38.381 --> 46:40.633
- Yes, we have.

46:40.675 --> 46:43.011
- I can't tell you
how much we enjoyed

46:43.053 --> 46:45.430
being with all of y'all
and watching you.

46:45.472 --> 46:46.765
And we learned about y'all.

46:46.806 --> 46:48.141
That was the incredible
thing about it.

46:48.183 --> 46:51.186
And each presentation
just was mind-boggling.

46:51.227 --> 46:52.979
But one stood out.

46:55.398 --> 46:56.691
And that was...

46:59.527 --> 47:03.365

Oh, look,

I was nibbling.

47:33.645 --> 47:34.813
I'll give it to you--
take that.

I don't care how small
they make these purses.

47:44.948 --> 47:46.658
You can never get anything out.

47:46.700 --> 47:47.909

We've got all day.

47:47.951 --> 47:48.910

48:06.136 --> 48:07.721

'cause I made my mom's most
world-famous gulab jamun cake.

48:12.267 --> 48:15.437
- She'll be over--
- Over the moon.

48:15.478 --> 48:18.815
- Now, sadly one of our teams
will be leaving the cabin.

48:18.857 --> 48:21.276
- Yes, and I just want to say

48:21.317 --> 48:23.111
we are going to make
the grannies do the hard part

48:23.153 --> 48:25.613
because I feel like they've
had it pretty easy so far.

48:25.655 --> 48:27.115

48:27.157 --> 48:31.619
Grannies, which team has
to go home with some leftovers?

48:31.661 --> 48:33.204
