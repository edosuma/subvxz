00:37.924 --> 00:39.584
Dad, taking the family to opening night

00:39.646 --> 00:41.948
is the nicest thing you've ever done for us.

00:41.992 --> 00:43.554
Or will ever do.

00:43.912 --> 00:46.826
I can't wait to see this re-imagining

00:46.850 --> 00:50.788
of Itchy and Scratchy by avant-garde 
director Juliana Krellner.

00:50.927 --> 00:54.972
Hey, it says here the book 
was written by Tom Stoppard.

00:54.973 --> 00:57.147
This isn't a book, it's a play.

01:04.995 --> 01:05.738
Book.

01:13.186 --> 01:15.219
All hail the king of the cats.

01:20.638 --> 01:22.511
They're coming down the aisles.

01:22.530 --> 01:24.842
What if they want to interact with me?

01:25.210 --> 01:26.733
Looking through my purse,

01:26.813 --> 01:28.047
looking through my purse....

01:28.047 --> 01:29.741
keep walking, monkey.

01:29.845 --> 01:31.641
Don't worry, mom, they all passed by.

01:40.346 --> 01:41.770
Itchy, Scratchy, Itchy,

01:41.807 --> 01:44.082
Itchy, Scratchy Itchy, Scratchy,

01:44.107 --> 01:49.943
Itchy, Itchy, Scratchy from the 
day you are born in the alley

01:49.966 --> 01:50.743
...Itchy, Itchy, Scratchy

01:50.757 --> 01:55.161
to the day you are hit by a car

01:55.197 --> 01:59.203
Itchy, Itchy, Scratchy there's cream to drink

01:59.225 --> 02:07.001
and mice to eat and great big balls of yarn

02:07.076 --> 02:09.979
Itchy, Itchy, Scratchy it's the circle

02:09.996 --> 02:14.550
Itchy, Itchy, Scratchy the circle of...

02:14.587 --> 02:15.450
knife!

02:20.815 --> 02:23.762
I love the use of streamers as blood.

02:23.795 --> 02:25.823
It robs the violence of its power.

02:25.876 --> 02:27.812
I'm drenched in blood!

02:36.068 --> 02:41.222
I don't know why I trust him

02:42.218 --> 02:46.900
I guess some cats just never learn

02:47.816 --> 02:53.842
I feel so good when I have crushed him

02:54.085 --> 02:58.383
or left him mangled, maimed and burned

02:58.917 --> 03:01.951
I suppose it's symbiotic

03:02.006 --> 03:04.973
and perhaps a bit erotic

03:05.088 --> 03:07.850
'cause painis my narcotic

03:07.938 --> 03:09.500
You really liked it?

03:09.557 --> 03:11.291
Yes, I loved it.

03:11.336 --> 03:15.781
And that's why we're always...

03:17.095 --> 03:19.251
fighting and biting

03:19.318 --> 03:22.333
and dynamite igniting

03:28.978 --> 03:30.353
Hey, check it out!

03:30.397 --> 03:32.933
I'm scratcher or something!

03:34.998 --> 03:41.832
It's the circle the circle of knife

03:46.347 --> 03:47.983
yes, the circle...

03:51.155 --> 03:57.551
the circle of knifes.

03:59.598 --> 04:00.422
Bravo!

04:00.728 --> 04:01.481
Genius!

04:01.926 --> 04:03.102
Necessary!

04:04.657 --> 04:08.133
I insist on seeing the director.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.290
Thank you, thank you.

04:13.505 --> 04:18.110
It's such a thrill for me to be 
backin my hometown, Springfield.

04:18.135 --> 04:21.380
She also graduated from Springfield elementary.

04:21.875 --> 04:23.132
Principal skinner!

04:23.897 --> 04:27.493
You know, Juliana, it's no surprise 
you became such a success.

04:27.545 --> 04:29.722
You always got straight A's in school.

04:29.775 --> 04:32.661
Well, I remember gettinga "b" or two in math.

04:33.637 --> 04:35.023
Well, of course you did.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.240
You are a girl.

04:37.597 --> 04:38.403
No. All...

04:38.445 --> 04:40.382
All I meant was, from what I've seen,

04:40.438 --> 04:44.642
boys are better at math, science, 
the real subjects.

04:44.745 --> 04:46.702
There, that should put the matter behind us.

04:48.376 --> 04:50.393
Calm down, calm down.

04:50.485 --> 04:52.083
I'm sure principal Skinner didn't mean

04:52.197 --> 04:53.911
girls are inherently inferior.

04:53.967 --> 04:54.973
No, 'course not.

04:55.018 --> 04:57.152
I don't know why girls are worse.

04:57.175 --> 04:59.071
One thing we can all agree on, though,

04:59.108 --> 05:01.542
this little lady surelooks pretty tonight.

05:01.597 --> 05:02.433
Am I right?

05:10.397 --> 05:12.693
Two, four, six, eight!

05:12.746 --> 05:14.722
Stop the man from teaching hate!

05:14.926 --> 05:17.130
Eight, six, four, two!

05:17.156 --> 05:19.213
We do math as good as you!

05:19.267 --> 05:20.343
One, two...

05:20.647 --> 05:21.873
Skinner!

05:21.976 --> 05:23.742
You've got to deal with these kooks.

05:23.836 --> 05:25.460
Don't worry, I have a plan:

05:25.678 --> 05:27.600
Pretend I agree with them.

05:27.606 --> 05:28.562
Well, you'd better hurry.

05:28.606 --> 05:30.140
Look what they've done to your car.

05:30.167 --> 05:31.941
No, that's how it always looks.

05:32.475 --> 05:33.331
How sad.

05:37.635 --> 05:39.962
Today, we celebrate the first of many,

05:40.005 --> 05:42.983
many, many, many diversity forums.

05:43.306 --> 05:47.402
Why is it that women "appear" to 
be worse at math than men?

05:47.445 --> 05:49.662
What is the source of this "illusion,"

05:49.715 --> 05:52.620
or as I call it, the biggest lie ever told?

05:52.857 --> 05:54.703
You're a worse version of Hitler!

05:54.718 --> 05:58.842
Please believe me, I... I understand 
the problems of women.

05:59.258 --> 06:00.002
See?!

06:00.696 --> 06:02.872
The principal's a tranny.

06:02.968 --> 06:05.880
Am I wearing women's clothes?

06:05.985 --> 06:07.183
I didn't notice.

06:07.265 --> 06:12.191
When I look in my closet, I don't 
see male clothes or female clothes.

06:12.208 --> 06:13.721
They're all the same.

06:13.825 --> 06:16.111
Are you saying that men and women are identical?

06:16.135 --> 06:17.431
Oh, no, of course not!

06:17.497 --> 06:19.391
Women are unique in every way.

06:19.485 --> 06:21.793
Now he's saying women and men aren't equal.

06:22.075 --> 06:23.291
No, no, no.

06:23.676 --> 06:27.002
It's the differences, of which there are none,

06:27.006 --> 06:29.941
that make the sameness exceptional.

06:29.987 --> 06:31.613
Just tell me what to say.

06:34.685 --> 06:35.471
Dear.

06:35.576 --> 06:36.942
Attention, students.

06:37.148 --> 06:40.751
Due to nervous exhaustion and 
diarrhea of the mouth...

06:42.036 --> 06:43.980
Yes, yes, yes, I said "diarrhea."

06:44.125 --> 06:46.442
Principal Skinneris going to be replaced

06:46.526 --> 06:49.852
by women's educational expert Melanie upfoot.

06:49.878 --> 06:52.680
Children, meet your new principal.

06:55.318 --> 07:00.652
For too long, there's been an 
anti-woman bias in math.

07:00.795 --> 07:04.373
Boys are aggressive, obnoxious, 
and never let us be heard.

07:04.627 --> 07:07.421
From now on, I am splittingthe school in two,

07:07.565 --> 07:10.501
separating the boys and the girls forever.

07:11.275 --> 07:12.703
You heard your principal.

07:12.797 --> 07:15.141
Girls on the left, boys on the right.

07:19.506 --> 07:20.340
This rocks!

07:20.538 --> 07:23.403
No more stupid girl classes, like ballroom dancing.

07:23.506 --> 07:26.490
No, that's still mandatory for everybody.

07:26.668 --> 07:27.320
Willie?

07:30.678 --> 07:33.950
Now, this is why I got into education.

07:40.487 --> 07:42.661
They're going to divide the school in two?

07:42.757 --> 07:44.733
Yeah, one for boys and one for girls.

07:45.036 --> 07:46.730
It is going to be awesome!

07:46.886 --> 07:50.103
Now I can walk down the hall with 
"Bart junior" hanging out.

07:50.138 --> 07:51.493
Isn't that right, Bart junior?

07:54.566 --> 07:57.570
All this hoo-haw about girls and math is silly.

07:57.938 --> 07:59.683
Women are as smart as men.

08:00.217 --> 08:02.672
Why, a woman invented liquid paper.

08:02.708 --> 08:04.791
Well, do you know what a man invented?

08:04.848 --> 08:06.552
Actual paper.

08:06.608 --> 08:09.002
Well, a woman also invented 
the windshield wiper.

08:09.017 --> 08:12.730
Which goes great with another 
male invention: the car.

08:14.996 --> 08:17.443
I think a woman came up with nylon stockings.

08:17.578 --> 08:18.863
I mean, probably.

08:18.917 --> 08:20.180
We certainly use them.

08:20.315 --> 08:22.491
Let's see, men also have rocket ships,

08:22.556 --> 08:25.132
suspension bridges, constitutional government,

08:25.205 --> 08:27.362
snow shoes, brass knuckles...

08:27.575 --> 08:30.941
pinball machines, the renaissance...

08:31.425 --> 08:34.321
Why did women invent sleeping on the couch?

08:39.955 --> 08:40.811
Girls' entrance.

08:40.980 --> 08:44.622
Have an empowering day, my 
pony-loving leaders of tomorrow.

08:49.420 --> 08:52.433
All right, I'm going to open 
this cage, but no biting!

08:52.513 --> 08:54.187
You're not the boss of my teeth!

09:00.848 --> 09:02.483
It's so beautiful!

09:05.858 --> 09:07.873
Paintingsby female artists!

09:08.188 --> 09:10.930
Frida Kahlo, Georgia O'Keefe...

09:12.245 --> 09:13.830
Cathy Guisewite!

09:16.278 --> 09:20.890
Now that the boys and their atmosphere 
of intimidation are gone, we can

09:20.936 --> 09:21.952
finally breathe.

09:22.165 --> 09:23.520
Breathe, ladies.

09:26.946 --> 09:28.603
Now, let's buckle down and do some math.

09:28.857 --> 09:29.430
Yes!

09:31.737 --> 09:34.203
How do numbers make you feel?

09:34.635 --> 09:37.203
What does a plus sign smell like?

09:37.548 --> 09:40.523
Is the number seven odd...or just different?

09:41.975 --> 09:44.870
Are we going to do any actual math problems?

09:45.026 --> 09:45.722
"Problems"?

09:46.496 --> 09:51.151
That's how men see math, something to 
be attacked, to be "figured out."

09:51.246 --> 09:52.492
But... isn't it?

09:52.706 --> 09:56.100
I mean, confidence building 
can't replace real learning.

09:57.748 --> 10:01.890
Sounds like you're trying to 
derail our "self-esteem engine."

10:02.056 --> 10:03.881
Let's sing it back on the tracks!

10:03.988 --> 10:10.373
The best thing I can ever 
be is to be okay with me.

10:10.485 --> 10:11.661
Me!

10:22.825 --> 10:25.993
Okay, boys' school, I need a challenge.

10:29.555 --> 10:31.370
A mental challenge.

10:44.536 --> 10:48.272
Now, boys, who can tell me 
the volume of this snowman?

10:48.406 --> 10:48.803
Anyone?

10:49.047 --> 10:51.200
Just add the volume of the spheres.

10:51.426 --> 10:53.350
We know the radii.

10:53.556 --> 10:55.790
He forgot the volume of the carrot nose,

10:56.117 --> 10:57.950
one-third base times height.

10:58.056 --> 11:00.463
Math, I have missed you!

11:00.597 --> 11:02.783
No girls allowed!

11:03.037 --> 11:04.023
Principal skinner?

11:04.257 --> 11:05.801
It's groundskeeper Skinner now.

11:05.898 --> 11:08.551
Assistant groundskeeper, you puke!

11:08.706 --> 11:11.460
Assistant groundskeeper Skinner, 
don't you think it's wrong

11:11.517 --> 11:14.513
that I can't get the best math 
education because I'm a girl?

11:15.658 --> 11:17.252
I don't have any opinions anymore.

11:17.388 --> 11:19.330
All I know is that no one is 
better than anyone else,

11:19.436 --> 11:20.800
And everyone is the best at everything.

11:20.995 --> 11:22.872
Not you. You're the worst!

11:22.955 --> 11:25.082
Now get poisonin' those squirrels.

11:32.408 --> 11:33.633
Please, be reasonable.

11:33.998 --> 11:35.390
I-I-I-I'm sure we can...

11:37.426 --> 11:39.330
Mom, the girls' school is a joke,

11:39.386 --> 11:41.692
and I'm not allowed to take the boys' math.

11:41.916 --> 11:46.090
When I was in school, I loved math, until...

11:48.888 --> 11:50.641
Hey, professor Von hubba-hubba!

11:50.806 --> 11:53.301
Want to hop in my dune bug 
and erode some beach?

11:53.795 --> 11:57.892
I'd love to, but I've got my 
calculus final tomorrow.

11:58.028 --> 11:59.030
Come on, baby.

11:59.148 --> 12:02.222
The only math you need is you 
plus me equals forever.

12:02.518 --> 12:04.300
Oh, Homey!

12:07.236 --> 12:10.452
Since then, I haven't been 
able to do any of the calculus

12:10.526 --> 12:12.722
I've encountered in my daily life,

12:12.808 --> 12:15.090
but that's not going to happen to you.

12:15.145 --> 12:16.311
Well, what can I do?

12:16.365 --> 12:18.301
They won't let me in the boys' school.

12:18.527 --> 12:19.431
Yes...

12:19.565 --> 12:21.202
unless...

12:25.008 --> 12:28.252
there. You're the perfect little he-she.

12:29.338 --> 12:31.690
Mom, I don't think this will fool anybody.

12:31.758 --> 12:34.020
Hey, who's the rude dude with the attitude?

12:34.266 --> 12:35.720
He's one of Bart's friends.

12:36.355 --> 12:37.283
You seem cool.

12:37.425 --> 12:38.271
Want to catcha movie?

12:38.395 --> 12:40.712
You never take our kids to the movies.

12:40.856 --> 12:44.002
Let's not fight in front of my cool new friend.

12:59.736 --> 13:00.720
What are you playing?

13:00.816 --> 13:01.952
Punch for a punch.

13:03.746 --> 13:04.972
So, what's your name, newbie?

13:05.198 --> 13:06.832
I'm... Jake.

13:07.106 --> 13:08.712
That's your christian name.

13:08.818 --> 13:09.950
What's your surname?

13:10.767 --> 13:13.500
Y...man.

13:13.667 --> 13:14.772
Jake Boyman.

13:14.857 --> 13:16.361
You have Toilet paperon your shoe.

13:18.297 --> 13:19.973
yeah, I guess I do.

13:20.157 --> 13:21.343
I'm going to call you "Toilet."

13:21.477 --> 13:24.251
My name isn't Toilet. It's Jake.

13:24.408 --> 13:26.380
Hey, a talking toilet!

13:28.097 --> 13:30.161
Toilet! Toilet!

13:30.768 --> 13:31.680
Class, settle down.

13:31.748 --> 13:33.152
We have a new student today.

13:33.886 --> 13:35.430
His name is Jake Boyman.

13:35.637 --> 13:38.471
He likes the hardy boys, boy scouts,

13:38.538 --> 13:42.340
boy bands, chef Boyardee, and he is a boy.

13:44.818 --> 13:45.872
What are you drawing?

13:46.068 --> 13:51.343
A robot with guns for arms shooting a 
plane made out of guns that fires guns.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.302
Everyone take out your math books, come on.

13:57.468 --> 14:00.152
Now, how many different numbers can "Y" be?

14:00.215 --> 14:02.972
That's easy, just one, the number five.

14:03.117 --> 14:03.603
Wrong.

14:04.555 --> 14:06.632
There are two possible solutions;

14:06.807 --> 14:08.673
five and negative five.

14:10.526 --> 14:12.561
Oh, my god, I was wrong!

14:12.666 --> 14:14.891
And by being corrected, I learned!

14:14.916 --> 14:17.891
And no one cared about my feelings!

14:18.905 --> 14:21.322
I drew a picture of you, being shot by a gun.

14:32.786 --> 14:33.741
Hey, Toilet.

14:34.757 --> 14:36.062
Just kidding, bro.

14:36.135 --> 14:38.293
They used to razz me when I was new here.

14:38.466 --> 14:39.723
It'll pass.

14:39.806 --> 14:41.211
Hey, Mildew.

14:41.298 --> 14:42.702
Do you like tongue twisters?

14:42.778 --> 14:43.930
Boy, do I!

14:45.008 --> 14:45.870
I'm sorry.

14:45.938 --> 14:47.073
Do you want a jawbreaker?

14:47.165 --> 14:48.271
Boy, do I!

14:50.186 --> 14:52.220
So do you miss having the girls around?

14:52.335 --> 14:53.033
Nah.

14:53.275 --> 14:55.193
Girls never really got me.

14:55.327 --> 14:56.780
Did you know Lisa Simpson?

14:56.976 --> 14:58.573
I heard she was pretty cool.

14:58.597 --> 14:59.381
Lisa?

14:59.637 --> 15:03.750
Yeah, we totally had a thing, 
but I had to break it off.

15:03.856 --> 15:06.151
What the hell are you talking about?!

15:06.177 --> 15:07.463
She got too clingy.

15:07.596 --> 15:09.870
Milhouse doesn't do clingy.

15:10.016 --> 15:10.803
I have to go.

15:13.676 --> 15:15.482
That was my eating food!

15:17.158 --> 15:20.821
Fight! Fight! Fight!

15:20.976 --> 15:23.510
Okay, I can talk my way out of this.

15:23.766 --> 15:26.173
Nelson, you're not really angry at me.

15:26.258 --> 15:29.063
You're full of rage 'cause your 
father abandoned you.

15:30.058 --> 15:33.833
And because you're poor, so you 
don't feel like you're good enough.

15:34.066 --> 15:36.700
You just want somebody to say "I love you."

15:37.486 --> 15:38.301
I love you.

15:39.845 --> 15:42.532
I love you, too, Nelson.

15:42.708 --> 15:44.723
I love you, Jimbo.

15:44.725 --> 15:46.983
Hey, every joke has a kernel of truth!

15:57.035 --> 15:58.231
Hey, Lis, you missed it.

15:58.408 --> 16:00.092
While you were at girls' school,

16:00.248 --> 16:02.462
Nelson totally whaledon this dork.

16:07.998 --> 16:10.602
oh, my god.

16:10.967 --> 16:12.021
That's right.

16:12.807 --> 16:14.172
I'm Toilet.

16:15.905 --> 16:16.413
Toilet.

16:19.498 --> 16:20.213
Not yet.

16:20.487 --> 16:23.902
If I do, she'll never let me go 
to the boys' math class again.

16:25.475 --> 16:28.210
Hey, no one with a choice should 
ever have to be a girl.

16:28.328 --> 16:29.983
I'll teach you how to be a boy.

16:30.287 --> 16:31.710
You'd do that for me?

16:31.865 --> 16:33.360
That is so sweet.

16:33.477 --> 16:35.321
You're a boy, nothing is sweet.

16:36.495 --> 16:37.373
That hurt.

16:37.505 --> 16:38.093
Sweet.

16:38.986 --> 16:40.353
Now, when you eat like a boy,

16:40.356 --> 16:42.923
only two french fries in five 
should make it into your mouth.

16:45.716 --> 16:48.011
If they fall on the floor, you want 'em more.

16:48.185 --> 16:49.832
Because then they come with extra toppings.

16:53.388 --> 16:54.940
I'm gonna be sick.

16:55.827 --> 16:58.273
Awesome! Do it in that guy's 
bag while he's not looking.

16:58.388 --> 17:02.161
I am looking, and don't start apuke 
war that you cannot finish.

17:02.287 --> 17:02.982
Good night.

17:03.647 --> 17:07.393
So, do you want to wang chung tonight?

17:07.527 --> 17:08.390
I don't know.

17:08.585 --> 17:10.119
Still frowny with you.

17:10.435 --> 17:12.992
Do you really think women 
are mentally inferior?

17:13.396 --> 17:17.571
Well, honey, you're just as smart as a man.

17:17.848 --> 17:19.051
Sometimes when I'm with you,

17:19.057 --> 17:21.369
I feel like I'm doing it with a dude.

17:23.907 --> 17:25.383
Well, I won't be lonely.

17:25.464 --> 17:27.381
I can always cuddle with the dog.

17:28.595 --> 17:30.930
At least everyone knows I'm smarter than you.

17:32.037 --> 17:33.932
Ho, how did this happen?

17:36.847 --> 17:39.062
Now I've been every ball on the playground!

17:42.945 --> 17:44.103
Now, for your final test.

17:44.347 --> 17:48.963
To fully become a man, you must pick 
a fight with someone weaker than you.

17:49.237 --> 17:50.061
A fight?

17:50.338 --> 17:53.583
That would mean rejecting the last 
part of me that's still a girl.

17:54.138 --> 17:55.150
Do it, Lisa!

17:55.297 --> 17:58.573
You'll be greater than or equal to boys.

17:58.736 --> 18:04.312
Even though you're only eight, your 
possibilities are infinite.

18:05.095 --> 18:06.082
27!

18:06.297 --> 18:07.451
Okay, I'll do it.

18:07.608 --> 18:09.060
But whom should I beat up?

18:09.995 --> 18:11.460
These dots are Itchy.

18:12.868 --> 18:14.500
Fine, I'll beat up Ralph.

18:16.535 --> 18:17.693
Give me your lunch money.

18:18.227 --> 18:18.871
Okay!

18:22.175 --> 18:24.470
I guess I'm gonna have to 
get this party started.

18:26.228 --> 18:27.783
Fight! Fight! Fight!

18:29.755 --> 18:30.853
Forgive me for this.

18:31.036 --> 18:31.602
Okay!

18:37.225 --> 18:40.451
You just beat up the most harmless kid in school.

18:40.668 --> 18:42.183
Well done!

18:44.888 --> 18:46.812
Hey, Toilet, want to play guns?

18:47.125 --> 18:47.760
Sure!

18:55.278 --> 18:57.281
I know what boys like

18:57.575 --> 18:59.453
I know what guys want

18:59.878 --> 19:01.792
I know what boys like

19:02.138 --> 19:07.543
I know what's on their minds sucker

19:09.146 --> 19:13.951
And the award for outstanding achievement
in the field of mathematics goes to...

19:14.217 --> 19:15.520
Jake Boyman!

19:15.945 --> 19:19.101
Toilet! Toilet! Toilet!

19:21.556 --> 19:22.250
Thank you.

19:22.526 --> 19:24.473
Or should I say thank you!

19:26.035 --> 19:27.781
Toilet is Lisa?!

19:27.996 --> 19:29.260
We've been Yentl'd!

19:29.365 --> 19:30.442
That's right, everyone.

19:30.557 --> 19:33.881
The best math student in the 
whole school is a girl!

19:33.935 --> 19:34.811
Wait a minute!

19:35.008 --> 19:37.280
Do you know why you did good at math?

19:37.518 --> 19:38.151
Did well.

19:38.236 --> 19:39.633
Give it a rest, Melanie.

19:39.848 --> 19:42.123
Calling me by my first name is harassment.

19:42.316 --> 19:44.653
Well, in for a penny, in for a pound.

19:47.736 --> 19:49.361
Superintendent.

19:49.535 --> 19:53.711
The only reason Lisa won is because 
she learned to think like a boy!

19:53.815 --> 19:57.630
I turned her into a burping, 
farting, bullying, math machine!

19:57.686 --> 19:58.733
That's a lie!

20:00.938 --> 20:04.183
I got hit by boy Lisa and girl Lisa.

20:06.928 --> 20:08.062
what have I become?

20:08.768 --> 20:10.871
I always thought that boys had it easier.

20:11.047 --> 20:15.491
But now I see their world is more 
cruel and sadistic than I ever imagined.

20:18.055 --> 20:19.102
Chair fight!

20:23.075 --> 20:25.630
And I did get better at math, but it was only

20:25.638 --> 20:27.973
by abandoning everything I believed in.

20:28.226 --> 20:31.771
I guess the real reason we don't see
many women in math and science is...

20:31.778 --> 20:33.180
would you hurry it up, please?!

20:33.187 --> 20:35.762
You're cutting into the 
award for best flautist!

20:36.057 --> 20:37.910
Well, whatever the answer is,

20:38.215 --> 20:41.843
I'm glad I'm a girl, and I'm 
glad I'm good at math.

20:42.325 --> 20:44.163
Now enjoy your stupid flautist.

20:48.268 --> 20:53.180
And the sandcastle virtues are all swept away

20:53.376 --> 20:58.100
in the tidal destruction the moral melee
